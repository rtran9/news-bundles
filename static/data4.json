THAT'S THE GOAL FOR REPUBLICAN\nPOLLSTER NOW CAMPAIGN MANAGER KELLYANNE CONWAY.\nOUR DANA BASH SPOKE WITH HER THIS MORNING.\n>> BACK IN 2005, YOU HAD SOME PRETTY TOUGH WORDS FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON. THE FACT IS THAT HILLARY CLINTON\nCOULD NOT STAND UP TO A CHEATING HUSBAND SO HOW IN THE WORLD\nWOULD SHE STAND UP TO NORTH KOREA AND SOME OF OUR OTHER\nENEMIES AROUND THE GLOBE? WERE YOU SUGGESTING THAT SOMEONE\nWHO RECONCILES WITH A CHEATING SPOUSE IS WEAK?\n>> NO. THE CONTEXT OF THAT PARTICULAR\nCOMMENT, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS, BUT I'LL STAND BY IT IN THE\nFOLLOWING SENSE. I THINK PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR A\nSTRONG, TOUGH LEADER. AND MANY AMERICAN WOMEN HAVE TO\nMAKE THE CHOICE THAT SHE MADE OR HAVE TO MAKE THE OPPOSITE\nCHOICE. BUT THE FACT IS THAT PEOPLE ARE\nLOOKING FOR STRENGTH AND PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR LEADERSHIP AND\nPEOPLE WILL PERUSE ALL TYPES OF DECISIONS YOU MADE THROUGHOUT\nYOUR LIFE. >> SO WHAT ELSE DO WE KNOW ABOUT\nKELLYANNE CONWAY? OUR CNN INVESTIGATIVE\nCORRESPONDENT CHRIS FRATES TAKES A LOOK AT THE FIRST FEMALE\nCAMPAIGN MANAGER FOR A REPUBLICAN NOMINEE.\n>> Reporter: A MORE DISCIPLINED DONALD TRUMP ON THE CAMPAIGN\nTRAIL -- >> SOMETIMES IN THE HEAT OF\nDEBATE AND SPEAKING ON A MULTITUDE OF ISSUES, YOU DON'T\nCHOOSE THE RIGHT WORDS. OR YOU SAY THE WRONG THING.\nI HAVE DONE THAT. AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I REGRET\nIT. >> Reporter: WHY THE CHANGE?\nTHE TONE BEARS ALL THE HALLMARKS OF HIS NEW CAMPAIGN MANAGER\nKELLYANNE CONWAY, A LONGTIME WASHINGTON POLLSTER WHO HAS\nHELPED SHAPE CAMPAIGNS FOR FORMER HOUSE SPEAKER NEWT\nGINGRICH, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE JACK KEMP, TEXAS SENATOR TED\nCRUZ AND INDIANA GOVERNOR AND NOW CURRENT VICE PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATE, MIKE PENCE. SHE'S CHALLENGED THE IDEA OF A\nHILLARY CLINTON PRESIDENCY FOR MORE THAN A DECADE.\n>> THE HIGH WATER MARK FOR HILLARY CLINTON THE MOST ADMIRED\nWOMEN WAS WAS THE YEAR THAT HER HUSBAND USED HER LIKE A DOOR\nMAT. HE CHEATED ON HER --\n>> THAT'S A SLUR. >> Reporter: THOUGH IN 2005,\nEVEN CONWAY MIGHT NOT HAVE BACKED A TRUMP CANDIDACY.\n>> IT'S TIME FOR A CHANGE. >> Reporter: SAYING IN A\nINTERVIEW ALTHOUGH AMERICANS PRETEND THEY HAVE THIS LOVE\nAFFAIR WITH CHANGE AND CHOICE, THEY ORDER THE SAME THING AT\nMcDONALD'S EVERY SINGLE NIGHT. THEY REALLY DON'T LIKE CHANGE.\nTHEY LIKE CONSISTENCY. THEY ADHERE TO SERNLT.\nNOW HER MISSION SO THE HELP TRUMP CRAFT A WINNING MESSAGE.\n>> WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT DONALD TRUMP IS COMFORTABLE\nABOUT BEING IN HIS OWN SKIN, THAT HE DOESN'T LOSE THAT\nAUTHENTICITY, THIS YOU SIMPLY CAN'T BUY AND A POLLSTER CAN'T\nGIVE YOU. >> Reporter: FOR TRUMP THAT\nMEANS WINNING OVER WOMEN VOTERS, A GROUP CONWAY HAS SPENT HER\nCAREER REACHING. >> WE RECOGNIZE THIS ALL ISSUES\nARE WOMEN'S ISSUES.

THAT'S WHAT AMERICANS\nAPPRECIATE. AND WE SEE IN HILLARY CLINTON\nWHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE INAUTHENTIC, WHEN YOU'RE TRYING\nTOO HARD TO BE SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT.\n>> Reporter: THAT WAS CHRIS FRATES REPORTING.\nCOMING UP NEXT, MORE ON KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP'S NEW\nCAMPAIGN MANAGER.

ONE OF CONWAY'S MOST VALUABLE\nSKILLS IS UNDERSTANDING FEMALE VOTERS AND THE ISSUES THAT\nMATTER MOST TO THEM. SHE IS A VETERAN GOP POLLSTER\nWHO DEVOTED MUCH OF HER CAREER TO HELPING CONSERVATIVE MEN\nREACH FEMALE VOTERS. NOW DONALD TRUMP MUST PERSUADE\nMORE IN THAT GROUP TO SIDE WITH HIM IF HE WANTS TO WIN IN\nNOVEMBER. YOU'VE SEEN THE POLLING.\nIN 2005 CONWAY CO-AUTHORED A BOOK \"WHAT WOMEN REALLY\nWANT: HOW AMERICAN WOMEN ARE QUIETLY ERASING POLITICAL CLASS\nAND RACIAL LINES TO CHANGE THE WAY WE LIVE.\"\nJOINING ME NOW IS THE CO-AUTHOR OF THAT BOOK, CELINDA LAKE.\nTHANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. >> IT'S FUN TO BE HERE.\nTHANK YOU. >> YOU ARE A DEMOCRATIC\nPOLLSTER, KENNYLLYANNE CONWAY I REPUBLICAN POLLSTER.\nTALK ABOUT THE STRENGTH YOU THINK A POLLSTER BRINGS TO\nMANAGING A CAMPAIGN. IT'S A DIFFERENT JOB.\nAND FRANKLY SOME POTENTIAL WEAKNESSES.\n>> IT IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF JOB.\nBUT THE THING THAT I THINK A POLLSTER BRINGS IS A REAL EAR\nFOR THE PUBLIC AND DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN A LITTLE TIN-EARED IN A\nLOT OF DIFFERENT SETTINGS. WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME LOOKING\nAT HOW PEOPLE HEAR DIFFERENT KIND OF LANGUAGE.\nAND WOMEN IN PARTICULAR PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION TO LANGUAGE AND\nHOW YOU SAY THINGS AND WHAT YOU SAY.\nAND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT QUALITY. AND WOMEN MAKE UP THEIR MINDS\nLATER THAN MEN. THEY GATHER MORE OF THEIR\nINFORMATION LATE IN THE CAMPAIGN.\nSO THESE ARE IMPORTANT QUALITIES.\nI THINK THAT ALSO HOPEFULLY WE CAN BRING AN IMPARTIAL VIEW.\nI THINK POLLSTERS ARE THE GREATEST DEMOCRATS BECAUSE WE\nBRING THE VIEWS OF THE PUBLIC TO THE CANDIDATES.\nAND HELP THEM BREAK OUT OF FAMILY AND INSIDE NETWORKS AND\nTHEIR OWN INSTINCTS TO HEAR HOW PEOPLE ARE REALLY HEARING THEM.\n>> SO YOU KNOW KELLYANNE CONWAY VERY WELL.\nYOU TWO WROTE A BOOK TOGETHER. YOU SAY SHE GETS MORE DONE\nBEFORE NOON THAN ANYONE ELSE GETS DONE IN A DAY.\nSHE CO-WROTE THE BOOK WITH YOU WHILE RUNNING HER COMPANY AND\nHAVING TWINS AT THE SAME TIME. PRETTY INCREDIBLE.\nDID YOU HEAR THE KELLYANNE CONWAY EFFECT WHEN DONALD TRUMP\nSAID THIS WEEK, I REGRET, AND BASICALLY APOLOGIZED, THEN ALSO\nWHEN HE IN THE LAST FEW DAYS HAS BEEN MAKING A MAJOR OUTREACH TO\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN AND HISPANIC VOTERS?\nIS THAT THE KELLYANNE CONWAY EFFECT?\n>> I THINK IT IS A BIG PART. I MEAN, I'M NOT PRIVY TO ANY\nDECISIONS. BUT IT'S WHAT SHE WOULD THINK.\nBUT THE GREAT NEWS TORE DEMOCRATS IS SHE STILL HAS TO\nWORK WITH DONALD TRUMP. WHILE HE MAY DELIVER HER LINES\nIN THOSE SPEECHES HE CAN'T STAY ON MESSAGE VERY LONG WITHOUT\nBLOWING IT OR SAYING SOMETHING .\n>> HE HAS. AND THEN HE COMMENTS ON THE SIDE\nAND IT'S A DISASTER. >> SO LET ME ASK YOU THIS.\nBACK IN 2005 -- I WANT TO PULL THIS UP.\nBACK IN 2005, CONWAY SAID THIS ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON.\nLET ME QUOTE. THE FACT IS THAT HILLARY CLINTON\nCOULDN'T STAND UP TO A CHEATING HUSBAND, SO HOW IN THE WORLD\nWOULD SHE STAND UP TO NORTH KOREA AND SOME OF OUR OTHER\nENEMIES AROUND THE GLOBE? SHE SAID THAT ON MSNBC.\nTHEN THIS MORNING MY COLLEAGUE DANA BASH ASKED HER ABOUT THAT.\nSHE SAID SHE WAS NOT TRYING TO SUGGEST THAT WOMEN WHO STICK\nWITH STRAYING HUSBANDS ARE NOT NECESSARILY WEAK, BUT SHE WAS\nSUGGESTING THAT ALL OF CLINTON'S DECISIONS ON AND OFF THE\nPOLITICAL STAGE MUST BE SCRUTINIZED.\nDO YOU THINK THAT IS A TYPE OF ATTACK ON CLINTON WE CAN NOW\nEXPECT FROM THE TRUMP CAMP WITH KELLYANNE CONWAY IN CHARGE?\n>> WELL, THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF ATTACKS THAT WE WERE SEEING WITH\nAND WITHOUT KELLYANNE. AND SHE HAS HAD A LONG-TERM VIEW\nTHAT SHE'S ARTICULATED MANY TIMES.\nYOU SHOWED A NUMBER OF PIECES OF FOOTAGE ABOUT THIS.\nTHIS WAS NOT SOMETHING IN THE BOOK, AND I THINK FRANKLY IT'S\nFUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED. FIRST OF ALL, THIS IS A VERY\nPERSONAL DECISION, AND MANY WOMEN ARE GRATEFUL TO HILLARY\nCLINTON FOR HER ACTIONS AT THE TIME, AND MANY WOMEN FEEL THAT'S\nTHEIR MARRIAGE, I'M NOT GOING TO JUDGE IT, I'M GOT ENOUGH\nPROBLEMS WITH MY MARRIAGE. AND MARRIAGES TAKE A LOT OF WORK\nAND THEY GO THROUGH A LOT OF PERIODS, AND SO I THINK THAT'S A\nFUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED LINE OF ATTACK, BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT\nSHE'S ARTICULATED FOR A LONG TIME.\n>> SO WE KNOW FROM KELLYANNE CONWAY THAT DEBATE PREP IN TEAM\nTRUMP STARTED THIS WEEKEND. TO BE A FLY ON THE WALL, RIGHT,\nWITH EITHER OF THESE CANDIDATES IN THEIR DEBATE PREP.\nBUT YOU KNOW HER WELL. WHAT DOES DEBATE PREP LOOK LIKE\nWITH KELLYANNE CONWAY? >> I REALLY COULDN'T SAY, BUT I\nTHINK PROBABLY SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK ARE HER\nTRADEMARKS, I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE DONALD TRUMP'S\nTRADEMARKS, SHE DOES HER HOMEWORK.\nSHE REALLY IS THOUGHTFUL. SHE WILL BASE WHAT SHE SAYS ON\nRESEARCH. SHE'S VERY VALUES ORIENTED IN\nHER APPROACH, AND SHE REALIZES, AS OUR BOOK DID, WE DID A\nTIYPOLOGY OF EIGHT DIFFERENT KINDS OF WOMEN AND WE REALIZED\nWOMEN WERE NOT MONOLITHIC AND REALLY WENT IN DEPTH TO ALL\nKINDS OF WOMEN. SHE'LL BE ATTUNED TO TONE, WHICH\nIS REALLY IMPORTANT TO WOMEN, AND I THINK IT'S AN ATTEMPT AT\nCOUNTERBALANCE TO HER CAMPAIGN PARTNER WHO HAS A LOT OF\nRHETORIC THAT TRUMP HAS, AND IT'S WILDLY UNSUCCESSFUL WITH\nWOMEN. >> WHEN YOU'RE DONALD TRUMP AND\nYOU'RE 20 POINTS DOWN AMONG FEMALE VOTERS, YOU WROTE ALL\nABOUT THIS. YOU WROTE A BOOK ON THIS.\nWHAT DOES HE HAVE TO DO TO GARNER MORE FEMALE SUPPORT?\n>> WELL, I THINK IT MAY BE TOO FAR GONE.\nDONALD TRUMP IS LIKE THE WORST DATE THAT MANY WOMEN HAVE EVER\nBEEN ON, AND I THINK MANY WOMEN HAVE FORMED THEIR OPINIONS, AND\nTHAT'S WHY WE HAVE A RECORD GENDER GAP.\nBUT WHAT HE HAS TO DO IS OPEN THE DOOR WITH SOME WOMEN WHO ARE\nMORE SWING AND WHO MAY BE LATER DE\nDECIDERES. THERE WERE THREE GROUPS IN THE\nBOOK THAT I THINK WOULD BE TARGETS FOR HIM.\nSUBURBAN CARETAKERS, SUBURBAN MOMS, IF YOU WILL, WHO SEEK\nSECURITY AS THEIR FUNCTION. SINGLE BLUE-COLLAR MOMS.\nKELLYANNE'S OWN MOM WAS SINGLE BLUECOLLAR.\nAND SINGLE SURVIVORS. DONALD TRUMP DOES BETTER WITH\nMEN THAN HE DOES WITH WOMEN. HE NEEDS TO TALK ABOUT SECURITY,\nTALK ABOUT AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS WELL WITH THEIR FAMILIES.\nWOMEN HAVE ALREADY DECIDED TO EXCUSE THEMSELVES FROM THIS\nDINNER. THEY'RE HEADED TO THE LADIES'\nPOWDER ROOM AND THEY'RE NOT COMING BACK.\n>> I DON'T KNOW, WE STILL HAVE 80 DAYS TO GO.\nA LOT COULD HAPPEN. CELINDA LAKE, THANK YOU FOR\nBEING HERE.",

THERE ARE MANY REPUBLICANS\nINCLUDING PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON WHO WANT TO SAY WE WANT TO KNOW\nIF DONALD TRUMP WILL BE RELIABLE TO DO WHAT WE WANT HIM TO DO.\nTHAT'S WHAT HE DEMONSTRATED LAST WEEK.\nI DON'T THINK THE CLINTON FOLKS ARE WORRIED ABOUT SWING VOTERS.\nTO JONATHAN'S POINT, THE SUBURBAN WOMEN, THEY'VE BEEN\nBOMBARDED WITH ADS FROM THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN LOCKING IN\nDONALD TRUMP'S PERSONA FOR MANY, MANY MONTHS NOW.\nIT WILL BE VERY HARD TO UNDO THAT WITH ONE SPEECH.\nI THINK REPUBLICANS WHO ARE LOOKING FOR A REASON TO TRUST\nTRUMP, THIS MIGHT BE THAT REASON THAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR.\n>> A LOT OF THE POLLS SHOW THAT SOME OF THE REPUBLICANS ARE\nCONCERNED ABOUT HIM BEING INTOLERANT.\nONE IN FIVE REPUBLICAN MEN SEE HIM AS INTOLERANT.\n25% OF REPUBLICAN WOMEN. SO WHEN HE GOES AND HE IS IN\nFRONT OF THE WHITE AUDIENCES, HE ACTUALLY IS APPEALING TO THOSE\nWHITE AUDIENCES WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT AFRICAN-AMERICANS.\nHE ISN'T REALLY, I DON'T THINK AT LEAST, APPEALING TO\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS. HE IS TRYING TO APPEAL TO THE\nAUDIENCES HE IS IN FRONT OF. >> YOU MENTIONED THE SOFTER\nTOUCH OF KELLYANNE CONWAY. SHE HAS NEVER RUN A CAMPAIGN.\nA LOT OF REPUBLICANS ARE NERVOUS ABOUT HER RUNNING A CAMPAIGN AT\nTHIS LEVEL. SHE HAS A HISTORY OF MESSAGING\nTO GET TO MORE MODERATE VOTERS. WE SAW DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE\nPENCE GO TO BATON ROUGE. IT'S A PHOTO OP.\nA LOT OF THEM DO. I AM NOT CRITICIZING HIM.\nHE WENT AND SHOWED SOME COMPASSION.\nHELPING UNLOAD AN AID TRUCK. ON A COUPLE OCCASIONS HE SAID HE\nTHOUGHT BARACK OBAMA SHOULD HAVE BROKEN HIS VACATION AND GONE\nTHERE OR AT LEAST COME BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE TO MONITOR THIS.\nIS THIS A SMART, REACTIVE POLITICS, NEITHER HERE NOR\nTHERE? >> I THINK IT'S A RARE MOMENT\nWHERE HE SAW A MOMENT THAT MADE HIM LOOK A BIT MORE\nCOMPASSIONATE AND WENT FOR THAT LANE.\nTHERE IS A LANE OPEN BECAUSE OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION UP\nUNTIL SEVERAL DAYS AGO NOT HAVING RELEASED A STATEMENT,\nTHOUGH THEY'VE DONE RESOURCE UPDATES.\nI THINK IT WAS NOT A BAD MOVE. THE QUESTION IS CAN HE FIND THE\nLANES FOR THE REST OF THE CAMPAIGN.\nYOU'RE RIGHT WHEN HE IS PROBABLY TRYING TO GO AFTER DISAFFECTED\nREPUBLICANS. HAD HE DONE IT SIX MONTHS AGO,\nIT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE LIKELY.\nAT THIS POINT IT'S TOUGHER. >> GREAT POINT.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WATCHED THE STATUS QUO SPEECH WERE LIKE, WHY\nDIDN'T YOU DO THIS BEFORE? T\nTHE CAMPAIGN SHAKEUP. I DON'T THINK VOTERS TEND TO\nVOTE FOR WHO IS ON THE LETTERHEAD.\nBUT THIS WAS INTERESTING. PAUL MANAFORT GETS SHOVED ASIDE\nAND THEN RESIGNS. KELLYANNE CONWAY GETS PROMOTED.\nSHE WAS THE SENIOR ADVISER AND IS NOW THE CAMPAIGN MANAGER.\nSTEVE BANNON FROM BRIGHT BART. AND ROGER AILES IS SHOWING UP AT\nCERTAIN MEETINGS. HE HELPED GEORGE H.W. BUSH MEET\nMICHAEL DUKAKIS. HE IS A GUY WHO JUST HAD TO QUIT\nHIS JOB BECAUSE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS.\nI CAN'T ASSUME THE HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN WON'T USE THAT\nIN AN ADD PRETTY SOON. INSIDE THE SHAKEUP IT'S MADE\nESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS NERVOUS.\nSTEVE BANNON HAS TREATED THEM AS A PINATA.\nIF YOU ARE A REPUBLICAN LEADER THE MAN HAS ESSENTIALLY CALLED\nYOU WORSE THAN THE DEMOCRATS. >> IT'S A JEKYLL AND HYDE\nSHAKEUP. THERE ARE TWO OPPOSITE SIDES\nHERE. THE CONCERN WITH BANNON IS THAT\nHE IS ONLY SKILLED -- AND A LITTLE BIT AILES -- THEY'RE ONLY\nSKILLED IN REACHING THE PEOPLE YOU'RE ALREADY REACHING.\nIS THAT THE GOAL? FOR A COUPLE DAYS IT LOOKED LIKE\nHE WAS TRYING TO REACH OTHER PEOPLE.\nI THINK HE'LL ALWAYS GO BACK TO THE BANNON AND AILES SIDE.\n>> MANAFORT CAME IN. HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE ADULT.\n>> HE DOESN'T WANT THAT. >> LOW ENERGY.\nHE JEB BUSHED HIM. >> TRUMP STARTED CALLING\nMANAFORT LOW ENERGY. TRUMP DOESN'T WANT ORDER.\nHE DOESN'T WANT DISCIPLINE. HE DOESN'T WANT A CHAIN OF\nCOMMAND. HE WANTS TO DO HIS THING, WHICH\nIS MAKING DECISIONS ON THE FLY BASED UPON COVERAGE, WATCHING\nSHOWS LIKE THIS, READING THE PAPERS.\nTHAT'S HOW HE OPERATES. WITH COUNSEL FROM HIS KIDS.\nLOOK, IS HE GOING TO HAVE FOLKS AROUND HIM?\nYES. BUT HE'LL NEVER OPERATE LIKE A\nTRADITIONAL CANDIDATE. MANAFORT'S EFFORTS TO IMPOSE A\nTRADITIONAL CAMPAIGN STRUCTURE ON TRUMP WERE FOUND TO FAIL.\nIN SOME WAYS IT'S AMAZING THAT IT LASTED THIS LONG.\nHE WAS TRYING TO MAKE TRUMP INTO A TRADITIONAL CANDIDATE.\nIT WAS NOT A MARRIAGE MADE IN",

LET'S TALK ABOUT THE NUMBERS,\nJUST THE HEADLINES HERE. $58 MILLION COMING IN JULY TO\nTHE CLINTON COMPANY, ABOUT 38 TO TRUMP.\nDONALD TRUMP IS THE CANDIDATE WHO HAS MORE GROUND TO MAKE UP.\nIT APPEARS HE HAS LESS MONEY TO DO IT.\nHOW DOES HE EITHER MAKE UP ENOUGH MONEY TO FIGHT ON THE\nFIELD THAT CLINTON HAS SET, OR DOES HE DO IT WITH MUCH LESS IN\nA DIFFERENT WAY? >> I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE\nTO DO IT WITH MUCH LESS. WE DON'T HAVE THE WALL STREET\nMONEY. WE DON'T HAVE THE BIG SPECIAL\nINTEREST GROUPS THAT ARE FUNDING HILLARY'S CAMPAIGN AND HAVE\nFUNDED HER ENTIRE POLITICAL CAREER.\nOUR DONATIONS ARE A LOT SMALLER, MORE GRASSROOTS.\nHE WON THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY BASICALLY ON EARNED MEDIA.\nYOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT IN THE GENERAL ELECTION.\nBUT STILL DONALD TRUMP IS SOMEBODY WHO AT HIS RALLIES GETS\n15,000 PEOPLE. HILLARY CLINTON GETS 3,000\nPEOPLE. HER OVER HEAD IS A LOT MORE.\nSHE HAS 700 PAID EMPLOYEES. WE ARE A MUCH MORE NIMBLE,\nGRASSROOTS ORGANIZATION. WE HAVE TO BE.\nBUT OUR FUND-RAISING, OUR TOTAL NUMBERS IN JULY WAS ABOUT $82\nMILLION. PART OF THAT WAS WITHCOMMITTEE.\nWE'RE RAISING MONEY NOW. THIS WEEKEND WE'VE SEEN DONALD\nTRUMP HAS BEEN IN NORTH CAROLINA.\nHE'S BEEN IN FREDERICKSBURG, VIRGINIA.\nHILLARY CLINTON I THINK HAS BEEN ON MARTHA'S VINEYARD, NOT GOING\nOUT AND SEEING THE PEOPLE, BUT FUND-RAISING.\nTHERE IS A DIFFERENT STYLE AND DIFFERENT APPROACH.\n>> WE'LL GET TO THAT DIFFERENT STYLE IN A MOMENT.\nLET ME COME TO YOU. AS THE CONGRESSMAN BROUGHT UP\nTHIS POINT, MUCH DEEPER PAYROLL, MUCH LARGER ORGANIZATION, HER\nBURN RATE HIGHER THAN DONALD TRUMP'S.\nIS SHE SPENDING TOO MUCH MONEY? >> DONALD TRUMP CAN'T MAKE UP\nTHIS GROUND, BECAUSE HE HAS NO GROUND GAME.\nSHE DOES. SHE HAS THE MOST AMAZING TEAM.\nSHE HAS THE MOST AMAZING VOLUNTEERS THAT ARE OUT THERE\nKNOCKING DOORS. A LOT OF THEM ARE EDUCATORS.\nI REPRESENT 3 MILLION EDUCATORS THAT WORK IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS,\nCOLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. WE KNOW WHAT'S AT STAKE HERE.\nAND THE WHOLE INTERESTING PHENOMENON ABOUT RALLIES, THE\nKIND OF MEDIA ATTENTION THAT DONALD TRUMP IS GETTING FROM THE\nTHINGS HE'S SAYING AT RALLIES IS NOT RESONATING WITH THE PUBLIC.\nYOU CAN TAKE A LOOK AT ANY POLLS, IN FACT ALL OF THEM.\nAND WHAT GETS APPLAUSE LINES AT A RALLY IS THE LAUGH LINE WITH\nTHE REST OF THE PUBLIC. THEY'RE NOT BUYING WHAT HE SAYS.\n>> THE SUGGEST IS THE FREE MEDIA HERE IS NOT HELPING DONALD\nTRUMP. >> ABSOLUTELY NOT.\nI THINK WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THE POLLS AND SEE THIS.\n>> LET ME PLAY THIS AD THAT CAME OUT FROM THE RNC ABOUT HILLARY\nCLINTON.

WE BELIEVE IN THINGS LIKE PUBLIC\nEDUCATION AND PUBLIC SERVICES. THAT'S WHY WE'VE GOT PEOPLE ALL\nOVER THE COUNTRY WILLING TO WALK NEIGHBORHOODS AND DO WHATEVER IT\nTAKES TO MAKE SURE SHE GETS ELECTED.\nI THINK THEY HAVE TO SHIFT THE DISCUSSION.\nTHEY HAVE TO GET PEOPLE TO, LIKE ON THAT AD, STOP ACTUALLY ASKING\nABOUT ISSUES. BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE\nISSUES, SHE'S GOT PLANS AND HE'S GOT SLOGANS.\nHE'S GOT NOTHING. >> THE ARGUMENT IS THAT WHERE\nHILLARY CLINTON IS GOING TO GET HER MONEY IS FROM THE ELITES ON\nTHE EAST COAST AND THE WEST COAST.\n>> AND EVERYONE IN BETWEEN.

CLINTON AFTER SHE HAD SOME\nFUNDRAISING ON MARTHA'S VINEYARD.\nTHEY SAY SHE RAISED $1.5 MILLION YESTERDAY.\nNO PUBLIC EVENTS, THOUGH, OR THE MR. TRUMP AFTER AN EVENT-FILLED\nWEEK.

ANOTHER BIG SHAKEUP IN THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN THIS WEEK PROMOTING VETERAN GOP POLLSTER KELLYANNE\nCONWAY TO CAMPAIGN MANAGER. AND BANNON TO CEO.\n>> I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS SHOWN US WHO HE\nIS. HE CAN HIRE AND FIRE ANYBODY HE\nWANTS FROM HIS CAMPAIGN. THEY CAN MAKE HIM READ NEW WORDS\nFROM A TELEPROMPTER. BUT IS STILL THE SAME MAN WHO\nINSULTS GOLD STAR FAMILIES, DEMEANS WOMEN, MOCKS PEOPLE WITH\nDISABILITIES, AND THINKS HE KNOWS MORE ABOUT ISIS THAN OUR\nGENERALS. >> JOINING THE PANEL THIS WEEK,\n\"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" COLUMNIST AND DEPUTY EDITOR DAN HENNINGER\nAND JAMES FREEMAN. KIM, LET'S TAKE THESE PERSONNEL\nCHANGES FIRST. DO THESE CHOICES, CAN THEY MAKE\nA DIFFERENCE IN THE CAMPAIGN? >> THEY SEEM TO HAVE MADE SOME\nDIFFERENCE SO FAR. WHAT WE'VE SEEN THIS WEEK IS A\nDONALD TRUMP WHO HAS BEEN READING FROM SCRIPT IN A MORE\nDISCIPLINED MANNER. WE SAW DONALD TRUMP IN\nCHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA, WHO ACTUALLY EXPRESSED REGRET FOR\nSOME OF THE COMMENTS HE'D MADE AND TALKING ABOUT HOW THIS\nNEEDED TO BE A CAMPAIGN THAT PULLED PEOPLE TOGETHER.\nWE KNOW HE'S GOING TO BE GIVING A SERIES OF POLICY SPEECHES OVER\nTHE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS THAT TOUCH ON IMMIGRATION AND EDUCATION\nREFORM. SO THIS IS A DIFFERENT DONALD\nTRUMP. YOU SEE THE INFLUENCE OF\nKELLYANNE CONWAY. THE QUESTION IS, CAN HE STAY ON\nTRACK. >> I WANT TO DISTINGUISH HERE\nBETWEEN BANNON AND CONWAY. WHAT SKILLS, EXPERIENCE DOES SHE\nBRING TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN? >> LOOK, SHE IS MORE OF A\nVETERAN PERSON IN POLITICS. SHE'S WORKED ON A LOT OF\nCAMPAIGNS, INTERESTINGLY WITH KIND OF ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT\nCHARACTERS IN THE PAST. SO SHE'S COMFORTABLE IN THAT\nREALM. SHE'S VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT\nTHE WOMEN'S VOTE. SHE'S MADE A KIND OF STUDY AND\nART OF IT. HER GOAL IS TO MAYBE MAKE DONALD\nTRUMP NOT JUST MORE RIGOROUS AND DISCIPLINED, BUT HUMANIZE HIS\nCAMPAIGN A LITTLE BIT AND MAKE IT MORE OPTIMISTIC.\nSHE SAID AS MUCH. >> THAT'S NOT STEVE BANNON'S\nFORTE. >> HIS IS TO APPEAL TO UNIONIZED\nDEMOCRATS, THE FORGOTTEN PEOPLE AS TRUMP DESCRIBES THEM.\nTRUMP HAS FINALLY FIGURED OUT HE'S NOT GOING TO WIN MERELY\nWITH THE BASE THAT PROVIDED HIM IN THE VICTORY IN THE PRIMARIES.\nTHE OPINION POLLS SHOW YOU LOSE IF THAT'S ALL YOU GET IN THE\nGENERAL ELECTION. NOW, I READ THAT SPEECH WHERE HE\nTALKS ABOUT THE SYSTEM BEING RIGGED, THAT'S BERNIE SANDERS.\nWHEN HE ATTACKED WASHINGTON INSIDERS --\n>> BUT THOSE ARE OLD MESSAGES. >> I'M TALKING ABOUT THE BASE\nHE'S TRYING TO ASSEMBLE. CLEARLY TRUMP HAS FIGURED OUT.\n>> WHAT ABOUT THE -- >> THIS IS DESPERATION ON THE\nPART OF DONALD TRUMP, SHAKING UP HIS CAMPAIGN THIS CLOSE TO LABOR\nDAY. THINGS ARE -- HE'S IN TROUBLE\nAND HE KNOWS IT. I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING OF A\nHAIL MARY. BANNON TO ME SIGNALS THAT TRUMP\nWANTS TO BE TRUMP. BANNON RUNS BREITBART, A WEBSITE\nTHAT IF ANYTHING THINKS TRUMP HAS BEEN TOO MILD MANNERED UP\nUNTIL NOW. SO THIS IS SOMEONE I THINK WHO\nWANTS TRUMP TO CONTINUE RUNNING THE CAMPAIGN HE RAN IN THE\nPRIMARIES. AND THAT'S WHAT HE'S SURROUNDED\nHIMSELF WITH. I THINK KELLYANNE CONWAY WE ALL\nKNOW HER, WE'VE KNOWN HER A LONG TIME.\nBUT SHE'S NOT A CAMPAIGN MANAGER.\nSHE'S -- THIS IS GOING TO BE NEW FOR HER.\nSHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO ADJUST TO THIS.\n>> WE'LL SEE. >> I THINK THAT'S HER TITLE.\nI DON'T THINK SHE'S GOING TO MANAGE THE CAMPAIGN.\nI THINK SHE'S GOING TO TRY TO IMPROVE AND REFINE THE MESSAGE.\n>> RIGHT. BUT CAMPAIGNS ARE ABOUT THE\nCANDIDATE. AND THEN THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH\nADVICE TRUMP SEEMS WILLING TO TAKE.\n>> THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.\nBUT HERE'S WHAT I -- WHAT'S SURPRISING TO ME.\nTRUMP SAID WHEN HE MADE THE  I'M THE SAME PERSON.\nTHEN HE GIVES THAT SPEECH, WHICH IS A DIFFERENT PERSON.\nAT LEAST IT'S DIFFERENT RHETORIC.\nIF HE HAD GIVEN THAT SPEECH AT THE CONVENTION THEN THAT HAD\nBEEN THE SPEECH FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS, I THINK THIS\nCAMPAIGN COULD BE IN A DIFFERENT PLACE.\n>> IT WAS A SPEECH TO ALL THE PEOPLE, TO THE FORGOTTEN PEOPLE\nWHO AREN'T WASHINGTON INSIDERS, BUT TO ALL AMERICANS.\nI THINK THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THERE FOR ALL AMERICANS TO\nAPPRECIATE. I THINK THIS HAS BEEN A GOOD FEW\nDAYS. I THINK TRUMP HAS BENEFITED FROM\nCREATING A STRUCTURE NOW. YOU DON'T WANT TOO MUCH\nMANAGEMENT IN CAMPAIGNS. BUT HE NEEDED A STAFF BEYOND HIS\nOWN INSTINCTS GOING OUT ON TWITTER.\nIF YOU THINK OF KELLYANNE CONWAY AS COMPETENTLY ALLOWING HIM TO\nSPEAK TO A BROADER AUDIENCE, MAYBE BANNON'S ROLE TO PRECISELY\nTARGET THE CASE AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON, THIS COULD BE A BIG\nWIN. >> HE'S ALSO ROLLING OUT ADS IN\nTHE CAMPAIGN.  >> IN HILLARY CLINTON'S AMERICA,\nTHE SYSTEM STAYS RIGGED AGAINST AMERICANS.\nILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS CONVICTED OF COMMITTING CRIMES GET TO STAY,\nSKIPPING THE LINE. OUR BORDER OPEN, IT'S MORE OF\nTHE SAME, BUT WORSE. DONALD TRUMP'S AMERICA IS\nSECURE. THE BORDER SECURE, OUR FAMILIES\nSAFE. CHANGE THAT MAKES AMERICA SAFE\nAGAIN. DONALD TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT.\n>> KIM, FIRST OF ALL, JUST RUNNING ADS IS A STEP FORWARD\nFOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. BUT WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT\nMESSAGE? THAT'S NOT THE MESSAGE OF\nCHARLOTTE. THAT'S THE TRUMP OF ANTI-TERROR\nAND THE PRIMAPRIMARIES. >> IT'S THE TRUMP TOO TRYING TO\nPLAY OFF GRIEVANCES OUT THERE, A GENERAL SENSE OF MALAISE AMONG\nVOTERS THAT THEY'RE NOT MOVING FORWARD.\nTHERE'S AN ELEMENT OF OPTIMISM TO THE AD TO IN THAT IT IS\nPRESENTING A FUTURE IN WHICH THEY'RE SAYING THE WORLD WILL BE\nBETTER UNDER TRUMP. IT'S NOT VERY SPECIFIC ON HOW\nTHAT WOULD HAPPEN. THIS IS MORE THE DONALD TRUMP OF\nTHE PRIMARY. >> ANYBODY ELSE HAVE A TAKE ON\nTHIS? JAMES?\n>> WELL, LOOK, THIS IS A WINNING ISSUE FOR HIM AS FAR AS LIMITING\nIMMIGRATION FROM PARTS OF THE WORLD WITH A HISTORY OF\nTERRORISM. HE SAID IN NORTH CAROLINA,\nDOVETAILS WITH THAT AD, WE'RE NOT GOING TO LED IN PEOPLE WHO\nTHINK SHARIA LAW SUPPLANTS THE U.S. CONSTITUTION.\nI DON'T KNOW ANYONE WHO COULD DISAGREE WITH THAT STATEMENT.\nYOU LOOK AT POLLS, THIS IS A WINNING MESSAGE.\n>> ALL RIGHT.",

EARLIER IN THE WEEK TRUMP NAMED\nTHE CHAIRMAN OF THE BREITBART NEWS WEBSITE STEVE BANNON AS HIS\nCHIEF CAMPAIGN EXECUTIVE AND KELLYANNE CONWAY AS HIS CAMPAIGN\nMANAGER. THIS COMES AS TRUMP ATTEMPTS TO\nBROADEN HIS APPEAL, EXPRESSING REGRET OVER COMMENTS HE'S MADE.\nJOINING ME NOW IS FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR RUDY GIULIANI.\nWELCOME BACK TO FOX NEWS SUNDAY. >> GREAT PLEASURE TO BE HERE.\n>> THE WEEK YOU'VE HAD, IT'S BEEN MIXED.\nTHERE'S BEEN TALK OF THE CAMPAIGN SHAKE-UP.\nBUT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE POLLS BECAUSE THIS IS THE\nREALITY OF WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH RIGHT NOW IN SEVERAL KEY\nBATTLEGROUND STATES. FROM OHIO TO VIRGINIA YOU'VE GOT\nMRS. CLINTON LEADING FROM 2.8 UP TO 11.2 PERCENTAGE POINTS.\nHOW DO YOU TURN THAT AROUND AT THIS POINT?\n>> WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY EARLY IN THAT SENSE.\nI MEAN, AT THIS STAGE OF THE CAMPAIGN, GEORGE BUSH 41 WAS\nBEHIND MICHAEL DUKAKIS BY 16%. BY 16%.\nAT THIS POINT IN THE CAMPAIGN RONALD REAGAN WAS BEHIND JIMMY\nCARTER BY NUMBERS FAIRLY SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU JUST SHOWED RIGHT\nTHERE. IN FACT, SOME OF THOSE ARE\nWITHIN THE MARGIN OF ERROR. SO I'M NOT CONCERNED AT ALL.\nI THINK DONALD TRUMP THIS WEEK HAD AN EXCELLENT WEEK, MUCH,\nMUCH BETTER THAN HILLARY CLINTON.\nIN FACT, SHE KIND OF DISAPPEARED FOR THE WEEK EXCEPT FOR HER ONE\nAPPEARANCE THAT I REMEMBER WHERE SHE SAT WITH A COUPLE OF\nDEMOCRATIC APPOINTED POLICE CHIEFS TRYING TO CLAIM THAT SHE\nHAS POLICE SUPPORT. AND I DON'T KNOW A SINGLE COP IN\nTHE UNITED STATES THAT SUPPORTS HER.\nAND I KNOW A LOT OF COPS. AND --\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT -- >> WHAT HE DID THIS WEEK WAS HE\nOUTLINED IN GREAT DETAIL WHAT HE WANTS FOR THIS COUNTRY, ABOUT\nISLAMIC TERRORISM, ABOUT THE ECONOMY, ABOUT BRINGING JOBS\nBACK. HE THEN MADE AN AUDIBLE, MEANING\nHE CHANGED HIS SCHEDULE TO GO TO LOUISIANA TO BRING ATTENTION TO\nTHE PEOPLE OF LOUISIANA WHILE THE PRESIDENT, YOU KNOW, IS\nSTILL UP THERE IN WHEREVER HE IS PLAYING GOLF.\n>> THE PRESIDENT SAYS, OF COURSE, HE'S GOING DOWN ON\nTUESDAY. BUT THAT WAS PART OF A VERY BUSY\nWEEK FOR MR. TRUMP. LET'S TALK THROUGH SOME OF THE\nSPEECHES THAT HE'S GOTTEN A LOT OF PRAISE FOR.\nFIRST ONE YOU TALKED ABOUT HE'S OUTLINED HIS PLAN TO GO AFTER --\nTO STOP RADICAL ISLAM. HE TALKED ABOUT EXTREME VETTING.\nWE ALSO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF HIS GENERAL ELECTION AD NOW AIRING\nIN SEVERAL KEY BATTLEGROUND STATES.\n>> IN HILLARY CLINTON'S AMERICA, THE SYSTEM STAYS RIGGED AGAINST\nAMERICANS. SYRIAN REFUGEES FLOOD IN.\nILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS CONVICTED OF COMMITTING CRIMES GET TO STAY,\nCOLLECTING SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS, SKIPPING THE LINE.\nOUR BORDER OPEN, IT'S MORE OF THE SAME BUT WORSE.\n>> CRITICS SAY POINTING TO THE IMAGERY IN THAT AD AND SAYS THAT\nIT PAINTS IMMIGRANTS IN A DISCRIMINATORY FASHION OR USES\nSCARE TACTICS. THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE WORDS\n\"EXTREME VETTING\" MEANS. CAN YOU TELL US?\n>> EXTREME VETTING MEANS FROM COUNTRIES THAT HOUSE TERRORISTS,\nCOUNTRIES FROM WHICH ATTACKS ON THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN\nLAUNCHED, THERE IS GOING TO BE A VERY, VERY STRICT TEST IN ORDER\nTO GET INTO THE UNITED STATES. YOU DON'T HAVE A RIGHT TO COME\nTO THE UNITED STATES. THERE'S NO SUCH RIGHT TO COME TO\nTHE UNITED STATES. SO WE SHOULD BE TAKING IN PEOPLE\nWHO BELIEVE IN US, WHO BELIEVE IN WHAT WE BELIEVE IN, AND WHO\nARE DEDICATED TO THE PRINCIPAL OF A NATION OF LAWS, NOT SHARIAH\nLAW BUT AMERICAN LAW. AND FROM CERTAIN COUNTRIES WHERE\nWE'VE HAD PROBLEMS, IT'S GOING TO BE PRETTY HARD TO GET IN.\nAND IT SHOULD BE. FOR EXAMPLE, TAKING IN SYRIAN\nREFUGEES, WHICH HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO INCREASE BY 550%,\nTHAT'S 5 1/2 TIMES MORE THAN OBAMA HAS BROUGHT IN.\nSHE WANTS TO BE THE ANGELA MERKEL OF THE U.S.\nISIS HAS TOLD US THEY ARE GOING TO PUT TERRORIST OPERATIVES IN\nWITH THOSE SYRIAN REFUGEES. THEY'VE ACTUALLY TOLD US.\nNOW, WE WOULD HAVE TO BE STUPID TO ALLOW THEM TO COME INTO THE\nUNITED STATES. WE WOULD HAVE TO BE OUT OF OUR\nMINDS. WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS SET UP A\nNO-FLY ZONE IN SYRIA AND PUT THEM THERE.\nKEEP THEM IN THEIR COUNTRY SO THEY'RE NOT FLOODINGY.\nLOOK AT HOUSE CLIMATE HAS GONE UP IN GERMANY SINCE THEY'VE\nALLOWED SYRIAN REFUGEES IN. ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU HAD TERROR\nATTACKS IN THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT PLACES IN GERMANY.\nWE DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN IN THE UNITED STATES.\nWE HAVE ENOUGH HOME GROWN PROBLEMS THAN TO BRING IN A\nBUNCH OF SYRIAN REFUGEES. I'M SURE MANY OF WHOM ARE\nLEGITIMATE PEOPLE, BUT WE'VE BEEN TOLD THEY ARE GOING TO HIDE\nTERRORISTS WITH THEM. AND HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO\nINCREASE THAT BY FIVE TIMES. SO SHE WANTS TO MAKE THE RISK\nFIVE TIMES WORSE THAN IT ALREADY IS.\nWE ALREADY HAVE 1,000 INVESTIGATIONS ACCORDING TO THE\nDIRECTOR OF THE FBI OF TERRORISTS HERE IN THE UNITED\nSTATES. SHE WANTS TO ADD TO THE 1,000\nINVESTIGATIONS. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT ANOTHER\nSPEECH MR. TRUMP GAVE THIS WOKE. HE DID SOMETHING WE HAVE NOT\nSEEN BEFORE, AT LEAST PUBLICLY. HE TALKED ABOUT HAVING REGRETS.\n>> SOMETIMES IN THE HEAT OF DEBATE AND SPEAKING ON A\nMULTITUDE OF ISSUES, YOU DON'T CHOOSE THE RIGHT WORDS OR YOU\nSAY THE WRONG THING. I HAVE DONE THAT.\nBELIEVE IT OR NOT, I REGRET IT. >> HE IS STILL THE SAME MAN WHO\nINSULTS GOLD STAR FAMILIES, DEMEANS WOMEN, MOCKS PEOPLE WITH\nDISABILITIES AND THINKS HE KNOWS MORE ABOUT ISIS THAN OUR\nGENERALS. THERE IS NO NEW DONALD TRUMP.\nTHIS IS IT. >> DO YOU THINK HE CAN WIN OVER\nHIS CRITICS, CONVINCE THEM HE'S TRULY SORRY?\n>> FIRST OF ALL, I'D LIKE TO SEE HER APOLOGIZE FOR HER LYING TO\nGOLD STAR MOTHERS ENSHE GAVE THEM A FALSE NARRATIVE OF HOW\nTHEIR SONS WERE KILLED AT BENGHAZI AND SAID IT WAS ABOUT A\nMOHAMMED VIDEO WHEN SHE DARN WELL KNEW IT WAS A TERRORIST\nATTACK BECAUSE SHE TOLD HER DAUGHTER THAT IN AN E-MAIL, THE\nNIGHT BEFORE OR THE NIGHT BEFORE THAT.\nI'D LIKE TO SEE HER APOLOGIZE FOR ALL THE MONEY THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION IS TAKING, LET'S SAY, FROM SAUDI ARABIA, WHERE WOMEN\nARE NOT ALLOWED TO DRIVE. YOU TELL ME SHE'S A FEMINIST AND\nSHE TAKES MONEY FROM A COUNTRY WHERE WOMEN ARE NOT ALLOWED TO\nDRIVE? YOU TELL ME SHE'S A FEMINIST\nWHEN SHE SPENDS A LOT OF TIME COVERING UP THE MISDEEDS OF HER\nHUSBAND AND ENGAGE IN A LOT OF THE ATTACKS ON THE WOMEN WHO\nWERE TELLING THE TRUTH? SHE'S A FEMINIST EXCEPT WHEN IT\nCOMES TO HER HUSBAND WHERE SHE ATTACKS THE WOMEN WHO ARE\nTELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT HIM. SHE DESERVES TO GIVE THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE AN APOLOGY. SHE CERTAINLY SHOULD GIVE US AN\nAPOLOGY FOR HAVING BEEN FOUND COMPLETELY CARELESS IN HANDLING\nNATIONAL SECURITY AS AN ISSUE. JIM COMEY SAID THAT.\nSHE SHOULD APOLOGIZE FOR LYING ON THIS SHOW ABOUT WHAT JIM\nCOMEY SAID. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO --\n>> WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THAT, BUT WITH THE SPECIFIC FOCUS ON\nHIM, DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE WRITTEN HIM\nOFF BECAUSE OF SOME OF HIS COMMENTS, DO YOU THINK THEY'LL\nACCEPT THAT EXPRESSION OF REGRET, NOT AN APOLOGY, DO YOU\nTHINK IT'S ENOUGH? >> I THINK IT IS.\nI THINK YOU'LL SEE THAT THROUGHOUT THE REST O THE\nCAMPAIGN. DONALD TRUMP IS EXTREMELY\nFOCUSED NOW. IF YOU LOOK AT THIS ENTIRE WEEK,\nYOU CAN SEE IT WAS FOCUSED ON ISSUES, HARD ISSUES, TOUGH\nISSUES, ISSUES ON WHICH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AGREE WITH HIM\nAND WITH US, MAYBE 60, 65%. 65 TO 70% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\nBELIEVE THE COUNTRY IS GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.\nAND IF HE CAN CONVINCE THEM THAT HE IS THE PERSON TO LEAD US,\nTHEN CERTAINLY HE'S THE ONLY ONE TO GIVE US CHANGE.\nWHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO -- THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS NO\nCAMPAIGN. SHE HARDLY APPEARED THIS WEEK.\nI DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE WAS. >> WHY IS SHE DOING SO WELL IN\nTHE POLLS? >> WHY?\n>> IT'S WORKING FOR HER. >> WHAT'S WORKING FOR HER IS SHE\nHAS AN ENTIRE -- READ MICHAEL  POST.\nSHE DOESN'T NEED A CAMPAIGN, SHE HAS \"THE NEW YORK TIMES,\" THE\nDAILY NEWS, CBS, NBC. SHE HAS ENTIRE MEDIA EMPIRE THAT\nCONSTANTLY DEMONIZES DONALD TRUMP AND FAILS TO POINT OUT\nTHAT SHE HASN'T HAD A PRESS CONFERENCE IN 300 DAYS, 200\nDAYS, 100 DAYS, I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG.\nFAILS TO POINT OUT SEVERAL SIGNS OF ILLNESS BY HER.\nALL YOU GOT TO DO IS GO ONLINE --\n>> HER CAMPAIGN AND PEOPLE DEFENDING HER SAYING THERE IS\nNOTHING FACTUAL TO THE CLAIMS ABOUT HER HEALTH AND THAT'S\nSPECULATION AT BEST. >> SO GO ONLINE AND PUT DOWN\nHILLARY CLINTON'S ILLNESS, TAKE A LOOK AT VIDEOS FOR YOURSELF.\n>> I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GET TO SOMETHING THAT'S CRITICISM\nCOMING FROM WITHIN THE PARTY AND GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO ANSWER\nTHAT. THIS WEEK REPUBLICANS FORMER\nLAWMAKERS, TOP GOP LEADERS WROTE A LETTER TO REINCE PRIEBUS\nURGING HIM TO DIVERT HIS MONEY AWAY FROM THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND\nANY MONEY AVAILABLE TO THE DOWN-BALLOT RACES.\nSAYING, QUOTE, WE BELIEVE THAT DONALD TRUMP'S DIVISIVENESS,\nRECKLESSNESS, INCOMPETENCE AND RECORD BREAKING UNPOPULARITY\nRISK TURNING THIS ELECTION INTO A DEMOCRATIC LANDSLIDE AND ONLY\nTHE IMMEDIATE SHIFT OF ALL AVAILABLE RNC RESOURCES TO\nVULNERABLE SNET AND HOUSE RACES WILL PREVENT THE GOP FROM\nDROWNING WITH A TRUMP-EMBLAZONED ANCHOR AROUND HIS NECK.\nYOUR RESPONSE. >> YOU KNOW, THE MOST AMAZING\nTHING TO ME IS THAT REPUBLICANS WOULD DO THAT TO OTHER\nREPUBLICANS. I HAD THE GREAT HONOR AND\nPRIVILEGE OF WORKING FOR RONALD REAGAN.\nIN FACT, HE'S THE ONLY PRESIDENT I'VE WORKED FOR.\nHE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT THE ELEVENTH COMMANDMENT WAS DON'T\nATTACK ANOTHER REPUBLICAN. I'M EMBARRASSED FOR THE PEOPLE\nTHAT WROTE THAT. I'M ALSO EMBARRASSED FOR HOW\nFRIGHTnd THEY GOT SO QUICKLY WHICH IS NOT A SIGN OF\nLEADERSHIP. I WROTE A BOOK ABOUT LEADERSHIP.\nONE CHAPTER IS ABOUT COURAGE. THE REALITY IS HE'S NOT THAT FAR\nBEHIND. HE'S WELL WITHIN STRIKING RANGE\nWITHIN EVERY ONE OF THE KEY STATES AND A COUPLE OF OTHER\nSTATES THAT REPUBLICANS DON'T HAVE A CHANCE OF WINNING.\nSO THIS IS UNNECESSARY FEAR ON THEIR PART.\nAND I'M SORT OF REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN THEM.\nBUT LOOK, DONALD TRUMP IS NOT A TYPICAL REPUBLICAN DEMOCRAT\nLIBERAL CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE. THIS IS AN INSIDER VERSUS\nOUTSIDER CAMPAIGN. SHE IS THE CONSUMMATE CORRUPT\nWASHINGTON INSIDER, AND SHE IS THOROUGHLY CORRUPT.\nAND SO IS THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nIF I WERE BACK IN MY OLD JOB AS U.S. ATTORNEY, I WOULD PROBABLY\nINDICT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION AS A RACKETEERING ENTERPRISE.\nTHEY TOOK MONEY FROM MONEY LAUNDERERS, CRIMINALS,\nDICTATORS, PEOPLE WHO ABUSE WOMEN AS A MATTER OF GOVERNMENT\nPOLICY. SHE DID FAVORS FOR THOSE VERY\nPEOPLE WHO GAVE MONEY TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nFOR EXAMPLE, UBS GAVE THE CLINTONS ALTOGETHER OVER A\nMILLION DOLLARS. SHE MADE A CALL TO THE IRS\nASKING THE IRS TO GO EASY ON THEIR ATTEMPTS TO GET IDENTITIES\nFROM UBS. IN MY DAY, THAT WAS CONSIDERED\nBRIBERY WHEN I WAS A U.S. ATTORNEY AND I PROSECUTED\nSEVERAL VERY PROMINENT POLITICIANS AND CONVICTED THEM\nOF BRIBERY -- >> MR. MAYOR --\n>> INCLUDING TWO CONGRESSMEN. >> WE HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE.\nAGAIN, THE CLINTON FOUNDATION AND ALL ASSOCIATED SAY THEY'RE\nNOT UNDER INVESTIGATION AND THEY'VE BEEN CLEAR AND\nTRANSPARENT. SO WE'LL STAY TUNED BECAUSE\nTHERE ARE THOSE THAT ARE -- >> THAT'S THE BIGGEST BUNCH OF\nGARBAGE I'VE EVER HEARD. >> MR. MAYOR, APPRECIATE YOUR\nTIME TOGETHER. >> THEY ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION.\nTHERE WAS A LEAK TO THAT JUST THE OTHER DAY.\nNUMBER TWO, IF THEY'RE NOT, THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE\nASHAMED OF ITSELF. >> WE'VE GOT TO LEAVE IT THERE.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING FOX NEWS SUNDAY, SIR.\n>> THANK YOU. >> UP NEXT, HILLARY CLINTON IS\nRISING IN THE POLLS BUT COULD NEW QUESTIONS ABOUT HER E-MAIL\nTESTIMONY HURT HER CAMPAIGN?

BACK TO YOU GUYS.\n>> LELAND VITTERT IN D.C., THANK YOU.\nA RARE DAY OFF. YESTERDAY TRUMP MET WITH A GROUP\nOF REPUBLICAN HISPANIC LEADERS, MANY OF WHOM GAVE TO NEWS\nORGANIZATIONS AFTER AND GAVE ACCOUNTS OF THE MEETING.\nBUZZFEED, HERE'S THE HEADLINE, IN REVERSAL, TRUMP NOTES\nOPENNESS TO LEGALIZE FOR IMMIGRANTS.\n>> AND DONALD TRUMP TELLS SUPPORTERS HE'LL BE HUMANE AND\nEFFICIENT WITH UNDOCUMENTED  KIND OF GOES DOWN THE LADDER THERE.\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WAS RESPONDING RIGHT AWAY TO THIS\nBUZZFEED HEADLINE. THEY'RE SAYING THIS IS CLICK\nBAIT JOURNALISM, THAT NO ONE ACTUALLY KNOWS WHAT WAS SAID IN\nTHE ROOM. SO HOW ARE THESE PEOPLE GETTING\nALL THIS INFORMATION. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOMEONE ON\nTHE SHOW LATER WHO WAS ACTUALLY IN THE ROOM AND HAD THIS MEETING\nWITH DONALD TRUMP. >> WHICH WILL BE NICE.\nTHE FIRST HEADLINE ON BUZZFEED, A SITE I WOULD NOT BELIEVE AT\nALL, DOES SUGGEST TRUMP IS FOR AMNESTY NOW, WHICH WOULD BE A\nMASSIVE STORY AND A MASSIVE REVERSAL.\nBY THE WAY, HE'S GIVING AN IMMIGRATION SPEECH VERY SOON IN\nWHICH HE'LL KIND OF LOCK IN HIS POSITIONS FOR THE PUBLIC.\nBUT IN CASE YOU DON'T REMEMBER IT, HE SAID A BUNCH OF TIMES HE\nDOES PLAN TO DEPORT PEOPLE HERE LEGALLY BUT DO SO AS HE PUTS IT,\nHUMANELY. HERE'S A MONTAGE OF HIS POSITION\nSO FAR. >> WE'RE GOING TO DO IT IN A\nVERY MU MAIN FASHION. BELIEVE ME.\nI HAVE A BIGGER HEART THAN YOU DO.\nWE'RE GOING TO DO IT IN A VERY HUMANE FASHION.\nWE'RE ROUNDING THEM UP IN A VERY HUMANE AND NICE WAY.\nTHEY'RE GOING TO BE HAPPY. THEY WANT TO BE LEGALIZED.\nYOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A DEPORTATION FORCE.\n>> SO DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN SAYS, LISTEN, THE SUBSTANCE OF\nTHE ARTICLE IS ACTUALLY CONTRADICTING THE FALSE\nHEADLINE, AND IT'S CLICK BAIT JOURNALISM, AS CLAYTON\nMENTIONED, PARTICULARLY THE ONE FROM BUZZFEED THAT SAID THIS WAS\nA REVERSAL. >> AND TO TUCKER'S POINT, IT\nWOULD BE A TOTAL REVERSAL IF THAT WAS THE NEW TRUMP PLAN.\n>> IT WOULD BE A VERY BIG DEAL. COMING UP IN THE NEXT SEGMENT,\nWE'RE GOING TO TALK TO A MAN WHO WAS IN THE ROOM DURING THAT\nMEETING. THEN IN A COUPLE HOURS, WE'RE\nGOING TO LEAD OFF THE HOUR WITH A CONVERSATION WITH JEFF\nSESSIONS FROM ALABAMA. WE'RE GOING TO GET TO THE BOTTOM\nOF THIS. >> SPEAKING OF THE LIBERAL\nMEDIA, ARE THEY GOING TO BE COVERING THIS?\nIN MINNESOTA, THERE WERE SOME TRUMP SUPPORTERS THAT WERE\nYELLED AT, SPIT ON.

AND THAT'S WHY I OVEREXAGGERATED\nTHAT PART. >> WHY DID YOU DO THAT?\n>> I DON'T KNOW WHY. YOU KNOW, IT WAS STILL HOURS\nAFTER THE INCIDENT HAPPENED. I WAS STILL INTOXICATED.\nI WAS STILL UNDER THAT INFLUENCE.\nAND I'M NOT MAKING ME BEING INTOXICATED LIKE AN EXCUSE.\nI'M NOT DOING THAT AT ALL. IT WAS MY FAULT.\nAND I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT. I SHOULDN'T HAVE EVEN JUST KEPT\nLIKE I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING. BUT I OVEREXAGGERATED THAT PART,\nAND THE GUN WAS DRAWN BUT NOT AT MY FOREHEAD.\nIT WASN'T COCKED AT MY FORWARD. IT WAS TOWARDS MY GENERAL\nDIRECTION. AND AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE\nSURVEILLANCE, THAT'S WHEN MY HANDS WENT UP.\n>> YOU TOLD ME ON THE PHONE, RYAN, YOU SAID, WE ARE VICTIMS\nHERE. WE ARE VICTIMS, AND WE'RE HAPPY\nTHAT WE'RE SAFE. IN THE POLICE PRESS CONFERENCE\nTHEY SAID NOT VICTIMS. THEY'RE VANDALS.\nHOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT? >> IT'S HOW YOU WANT TO MAKE IT\nLOOK LIKE. WHETHER YOU CALL IT A ROBBERY,\nWHETHER YOU CALL IT EXTORTION OR US PAYING JUST FOR THE DAMAGES,\nLIKE WE DON'T KNOW. ALL WE KNOW IS THAT THERE WAS A\nGUN POINTED IN OUR DIRECTION AND WE WERE DEMANDED TO GIVE MONEY.\n>> AND THAT'S A REALLY INTERESTING POINT.\nI WANT TO TAKE A LITTLE TIME ON THAT.\nIF I WERE TO ASK YOU THE SAME QUESTION AGAIN WERE YOU ROBBED\nON SUNDAY MORNING IN RIO, HOW WOULD YOU ANSWER?\n>> I CAN'T ANSWER THAT. BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF --\nBECAUSE I WAS INTOXICATED. SO I DON'T KNOW.\nALL I KNOW IS THAT THERE WAS A GUN POINTED AT US AND WE WERE\nDEMANDED TO GIVE MONEY. WHETHER IT WAS TO PAY FOR THE\nDAMAGES OF THE POSTER, WHETHER IT WAS EXTORTION OR WHETHER IT\nWAS A ROBBERY, LIKE, I CAN'T -- I CAN'T -- I'M NOT EQUIPPED\nTO -- >> BUT I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT\nGUNNAR, IN HIS STATEMENT TO POLICE SAID, AT SOME POINT\nSOMEONE WHO SPOKE ENGLISH WALKED OVER AND OFFERED TO HELP\nTRANSLATE THIS ALTERCATION. AND HE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THIS\nSECURITY GUARD WAS TELLING THE FOUR OF YOU YOU NEED TO PAY FOR\nTHAT STUFF, THAT DAMAGE BEFORE YOU CAN LEAVE HERE OR I'M GOING\nTO CALL THE POLICE. YOU UNDERSTOOD THAT AT THAT\nTIME, DIDN'T YOU? >> YEAH.\nSO THEN WE HAD TO GIVE THE MONEY.\n>> RIGHT. BUT AT THAT POINT IT'S NOT A\nROBBERY. AT THAT POINT YOU'RE STRIKING A\nDEAL. YOU'RE STRIKING A DEAL TO PAY\nFOR WHAT DAMAGE YOU'VE CAUSED SO THAT HE DOESN'T CALL THE POLICE,\nAND THIS DOESN'T BECOME A BIGGER INCIDENT.\nISN'T THAT FAIR? >> WE JUST WANTED TO GET OUT OF\nTHERE. WE WERE HELD -- I MEAN, THERE\nWAS A GUN POINTED IN OUR DIRECTION.\nWE WERE ALL FRIGHTENED. >> THAT'S UNCOMFORTABLE TO\nLISTEN TO. JOINING ME NOW ON THE PHONE\nCHRISTINE BRENNAN, SPORTS ANALYST AND I'M JOINED IN STUDIO\nBY PRESIDENT OF MARKETING INCORPORATED.\nCHRISTINE, LET ME START WITH YOU FIRST.\nTHE U.S. INTERVIEW WAS ACTUALLY JUST PART OF HIS APOLOGY TOUR T\nI GUESS YOU COULD CALL IT. HE'S ALSO APPEARED ON ONE OF\nBRAZIL'S BIGGEST TELEVISION NETWORKS.\nWHAT'S BEEN THE REACTION DOWN THERE TO HIS APOLOGY?\n>> MARTIN, I THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO MOVE ON FROM IT.\nCLOSING CEREMONIES ARE IN A COUPLE HOURS, GAMES ARE ENDING.\nTHE BRAZILIANS ARE PLEASED THAT THERE HAS BEEN AN APOLOGY.\nIT WAS A LONG TIME COMING. I THINK OVERALL FOR RYAN LOCHTE,\nCLEARLY HIS PUBLIC RELATIONS PEOPLE DID NOT TAKE A PAGE OUT\nOF THE MICHAEL PHELPS' APOLOGY PLAYBOOK BECAUSE PHELPS, OF\nCOURSE, HAS BEEN IN TROUBLE A COUPLE OF TIMES.\nBOTH TIMES THE NEXT DAY WITHIN 24 HOURS HE ISSUED A ONE\nPARAGRAPH APOLOGY TAKING FULL BLAME FOR EVERYTHING.\nTHE MARIJUANA PIPE PHOTO IN 2009 AND IN 2014 HIS SECOND DUI AND\nWAS SUSPENDED BY USA SWIMMING BOTH TIMES BUT GOT IT OUT OF THE\nWAY QUICKLY. THIS, DRAGGING IT ON FOR OVER A\nWEEK AND STILL NOT ABLE TO ANSWER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS I\nTHINK IS JUST A PUBLIC RELATIONS NIGHTMARE FOR RYAN LOCHTE.\n>> CARLOS, FROM A PUBLIC RELATIONS PROFESSIONAL AS YOU\nARE, I SAID THAT INTERVIEW WAS UNCOMFORTABLE.\nWHAT I MEANT BY THAT IS THAT YOU KNOW WHAT HE HAS TO SAY.\nJUST SAY IT. >> RIGHT.\nAND BE DONE WITH IT. BUT HE DOESN'T.\nHOW DO YOU THINK THIS HAS BEEN HANDLED?\n>> I THINK IT'S BEEN HANDLED VERY POORLY FIRST AND FOREMOST\nBY LOCHTE AND WHOEVER HIS PR REPRESENTATIVES ARE.\nI WAS VERY SURPRISED TO FIND OUT THAT HE HAD TO HIRE SOMEONE\nCONSIDERING THAT HE'S AN OLYMPIC STAR FOR SEVERAL OLYMPICS.\nYOU WOULD THINK THAT HE ALREADY HAS A PR, REPUTABLE PR\nREPRESENTING HIM. >> WHAT SHOULD HE HAVE DONE?\nWHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE VERY FIRST STEP?\n>> I'LL PIGGYBACK ON WHAT CHRISTINE BRENNAN SAID, AND I\nAGREE 100%, THE NEXT DAY HE SHOULD HAVE -- WELL, FIRST AND\nFOREMOST HE SHOULD HAVE NEVER CAME UP WITH THE LIE.\nBECAUSE IF HE DOESN'T SAY THAT, THERE'S NO HARM, NO FOUL, NO ONE\nKNOWS ABOUT IT. BUT TO DEAL WITH IT FROM A --\nCOMING BACK FROM THAT, HE REALLY SHOULD HAVE OWNED UP TO IT FIRST\nAND FOREMOST. SECOND OF ALL, NOT BLAME ALCOHOL\nOR ANYTHING OR DEFLECT BLAME ON ANY OF THE SITUATION.\nAND THEN SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE FOR THOSE THREE GUYS THAT WERE\nLEFT BEHIND. I THINK THOSE THREE THINGS, FOR\nME, AS A PR EXPERT, THOSE STICK OUT THE BIGGEST.\n>> HOW BAD IS THE DAMAGE HERE FOR HIM?\n>> I'LL TELL YOU, IT'S PRETTY BAD AND PRETTY MUCH HE COST\nHIMSELF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WE'VE HAD SITUATIONS,\nUNFORTUNATELY, OVER THE PAST WHERE WE'VE HAD TO SUCCESSFULLY\nNAVIGATE CLIENTS THROUGH MEDIA CRISIS MOMENTS AND WE WERE ABLE\nTO LUCKILY EACH TIME NOT ONLY CLEAR THEIR NAME BUT ALSO EVEN\nGET NEW ENDORSEMENTS, BUT IT'S BECAUSE OF HOW WE SUCCESSFULLY\nPUT TOGETHER A TEAM, PUT TOGETHER STRATEGY.\n>> WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE THIS TIME?\nWHY DO YOU NOT SEEM SO OPTIMISTIC?\n>> FOR ONE, LIKE CHRISTINE SAID, THIS HAS LINGERED ON FOR OVER A\nWEEK. AND IT'S REALLY A TRAGEDY\nBEC BECAUSE, YEAH, SO MANY GREAT\nATHLETES FROM ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY, ALL AROUND THE WORLD\nWHO WON OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALS FOR THEIR COUNTRIES AS WELL AS OUR\nCOUNTRY AND THE BIGGEST STORIES HAS ALL THIS WEEK BEEN RYAN\nLOCHTE. I REALLY FEEL THAT WE EVEN HAD\nCLIENTS THAT WON MEDALS AND, UNFORTUNATELY, THEIR STORIES\nKIND OF MINIMALIZED BECAUSE THE MEDIA WANTED TO FOLLOW THIS.\n>> THAT ADDS TO THE ANGER. >> YEAH, IT DOES.\n>> I WANT TO BRING UP SOMETHING ELSE CHRISTINE BEFORE WE LOSE\nYOU AND I KNOW TIME IS SHORT. THESE ATHLETES THAT ARE BEING\nFORCED TO PAY $3,000 EACH IN FINES BEFORE AUTHORITIES ALLOW\nTHEM TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY, WHAT ARE THEY ACCUSED OF DOING?\nWHAT'S THE LATEST ON THIS? >> YOU KNOW, MARTIN, I HAVE\nACTUALLY NOT FOLLOWED THAT STORY AS CLOSELY.\nI BELIEVE THERE WAS SOMETHING WITH THEIR I.D.s, I BELIEVE,\nTHAT THEY MADE FAKE I.D.s. AND YOU KNOW, I THINK THE BIGGER\nISSUE HERE IS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOUNG ATHLETES AND THINGS\nARE GOING TO HAPPEN. AND YOU WANT TO MINIMIZE IT.\nI THINK YOU'RE SAYING THAT IT'S THE AUSTRALIAN OLYMPIC\nCOMMITTEE, YOU'RE BRINGING HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE INTO A\nCOMMUNITY OR INTO THIS CRUCIBLE OF INTERNATIONAL INTRIGUE AND\nEVERYONE'S WATCHING AT THE WORLD'S STAGE.\nSO YOU WILL HAVE A FEW THINGS HAPPEN.\nIT'S HOW YOU HANDLE IT. THE AUSTRALIAN THING IS\nINTERESTING. OF COURSE, THERE'S ALWAYS GOING\nTO BE SOMETHING. BUT I THINK THE LOCHTE THING\nSTANDS OUT ONLY BECAUSE OF JUST HOW LONG IT WENT ON AND WHAT AN\nEMBARRASSMENT IT WAS FOR THE U.S. ESPECIALLY U.S. BEING THE\nBIG CHEESE AT THE OLYMPIC GAMES WHERE EVERYONE FOCUSES ON WHAT\nTHE U.S. DOES AND U.S. OLYMPICS LIKES TO HAVE THINGS BE VERY LOW\nKEY. ONE OF ONLY TWO OLYMPICS THAT\nDOES NOT ALLOW FLAGS OR BANNERS ON THE DORMS AT THE OLYMPIC\nVILLAGE. AND U.S. AND ISRAEL, OF COURSE,\nFOR SECURITY REASONS, BUT ALSO TO HAVE A LOWER PROFILE.\nTHEN THIS HAPPENS. SO THE AUSTRALIANS ARE DEALING\nWITH SOMETHING, THE U.S. DEALING WITH SOMETHING.\nIT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. BUT THE LAST THING THE U.S.\nWANTS, MARTIN, IS TO HAVE SOMETHING EXPLODE LIKE THIS ONE\nEXPLODED OVER THE LAST WEEK OF THE GAMES.\n>> YEAH, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.\nCHRISTINE BRENNAN, I HAVE ALL RESPECT FOR YOUR WORK, THANK YOU\nVERY MUCH. CARLOS SCOTT, THANKS FOR JOINING\nME TODAY. I HOPE I WOULD NEVER NEED YOU,\nBUT IT'S GOOD TO KNOW YOU'RE THERE.\nTHANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT UP THE WORK IS JUST\nBEGINNING IN LOUISIANA. YOU'VE SEEN THE IMAGES NOW.\nUNFORTUNATELY THERE'S MORE RAIN THAT'S COMING DOWN AND REPORTS\nOF A FLOOD WARNING AGAIN FOR BATON ROUGE, WE'LL CHECK IN ON\nTHE GROUND AND SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE RIGHT AFTER\nTHIS.",

IF I WERE TO ASK YOU THE SAME\nQUESTION AGAIN RIGHT NOW AND SAY, WERE YOU ROB OWBED ON SUND\nMORNING IN RIO, HOW WOULD YOU ANSWER?\n>> I CAN'T ANSWER THAT. I DON'T KNOW IF -- I WAS\nINTOXICATED SO I DON'T KNOW. ALL I KNOW IS THERE WAS A GUN\nPOINTED AT US AND WE WERE DEMANDED TO GIVE MONEY.\nWHETHER TO PAY FOR THE DAMAGES OF THE POSTER, WHETHER IT WAS SO\nEXTORTION OR WHETHER IT WAS A ROBBERY, LIKE I CAN'T -- I'M\nNOT -- I'M NOT EQUIPPED TO LIKE --\n>> EXCEPT I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT GUNNAR IN HIS STATEMENT TO\nPOLICE SAID AT SOME POINT SOMEONE WHO SPOKE ENGLISH WALKED\nOVER AND OFFERED TO TRANSLATE THIS ALTERCATION.\nAND HE MADE IT CLEAR THAT SECURITY GUARD WAS TELLING THE\nFOUR OF YOU, YOU NEED TO PAY FOR THAT STUFF, THAT DAMAGE BEFORE\nYOU CAN LEAVE HERE OR I'M GOING TO CALL THE POLICE.\nYOU UNDERSTOOD THAT AT THAT TIME, DIDN'T YOU?\n>> YEAH. SO WE TODAHAD TO GIVE THE MONEY.\n>> SO AT THAT POINT, THAT'S NOT A ROBBERY.\nYOU'RE STRIKING A DEAL. YOU'RE STRIKING A DEAL TO PAY\nFOR WHAT DAMAGE YOU'VE CAUSE SEWED HE DOESN'T CALL THE POLICE\nAND THIS DOESN'T BECOME A BIGGER INCIDENT.\nISN'T THAT FAIR? >> WE JUST WANTED TO GET OUT OF\nTHERE. THERE WAS A GUNPOINTED IN OUR\nDIRECTION. WE WERE FRIGHTENED.\nWE WANTED TO GET OUT OF THERE AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE.\nTHIS GUY SAID TO GIVE HIM MONEY. SO WE GAVE HIM MONEY AND WE\nWANTED TO GET OUT. >> THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A\nROBBERY. SOMEONE TARGETS YOU, TAKING YOUR\nMONEY, BELONGS AND VALUABLE POSSESS.\nTHIS GUY WAS NEGOTIATING A DEAL BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED ON THE\nWALK WAY AND YOU GUYS WERE ON THE OTHER END OF THE\nNEGOTIATION. >> THAT'S WHY PEOPLE CAN SEE IT\nIN MANY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. ALL WE KNOW IS THERE WAS A GUN\nPOINTED TO US AND WE WERE DEMANDED TO GIVE HIM MONEY.\nEND OF STORY. >> WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS THE\nFIRST FIRST YOU TOLD, RYAN, IS MUCH MORE ABOUT THE MEAN STREETS\nOF RIO. >> YES.\n>> AND THE VERSION WE HEAR NOW IS MUCH MORE ABOUT A NEGOTIATED\nSETTLEMENT TO COVER UP SOME DUMB BEHAVIOR.\n>> AND THAT'S WHY I'M TAKING FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT.\nAND BECAUSE I OVEREXAGGERATED THAT STORY AND IF I NEVER HAD\nDONE THAT WE WOULDN'T BE IN THIS MESS.\nTHOSE GUYS WOULD NEVER BE IN RIO OR WERE IN RIO -- NONE OF THIS\nWOULD HAVE HAPPENED AND IT WAS MY IMMATURE BEHAVIOR OF, YOU\nKNOW, GENTLEMEN JUST FINISHED. WE WERE WANTING TO CELEBRATE.\nAND WE HADN'T BEEN DRINKING OR ANYTHING FOR MONTHS BEFORE THAT.\nAND I DEFINITELY HAD TOO MUCH TO DRINK THAT NIGHT AND HE WAS VERY\nINTOXICATED. AND NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE\nHAPPENED IF I DIDN'T DO THAT. >> I'M JOINED NOW BY CNN'S DON\nRIDDELL LIVE IN RIO AND I ALSO HAVE MIKE PAUL, THE MAN KNOWN AS\nREPUTATION DOCTOR. HE IS STANDING BY IN YORK NEW\nYORK. DON, FIRST TO YOU.\nNOW THAT LOCHTE ISSUED THIS APOLOGY, ARE YOU HEARING\nANYTHING ON DISCIPLINARY ACTION? HAS ANYTHING CHANGED?\n>> I THINK THAT IS ALMOST CERTAINLY STILL TO COME BUT THE\nUNITED STATES OLYMPIC COMMITTEE MARTIN IS STILL TRYING TO KEEP\nTHEIR SUCCESSFUL AND CLEAN AND WELL-BEHAVED ATHLETES STILL IN\nTHE SPOTLIGHT AND THEY HAVE FOUND THAT HARD TO DO.\nSO ALLYSON FELIX AND SIMONE BILES AND OTHERS WERE THERE AND\nCEO OF THE OAC SCOTT BLACKMAN DID DISCUSS THIS BRIEFLY AND\nCONFIRMED FURTHER ACTION WILL BE TAKEN WHEN WE GET BACK TO THE\nUNITED STATES. I THINK THEY HAVE REALIZED THAT\nTHE MORE FUEL THAT IS POURED ON TO THIS FIRE, THE MORE OF THE\nSPOTLIGHT IS TAKEN FROM THE ATHLETES.\nTHEY WANT TO GET THE OLYMPICS OVER AND DONE WITH, GET BACK TO\nTHE UNITED STATES AND DEAL WITH IT THEN.\nBUT THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT THIS HAS BEEN A REALLY REALLY\nBIG PROBLEM FOR THE AMERICAN ATHLETES HERE.\nALL OF THEM.

WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OLYMPIC\nSWICKER RYAN LOCHTE. HE IS SITTING DOWN FOR AN\nINTERVIEW AND SOME LIKEN IT TO A CONFESSIONAL.\nWHAT HE IS ADMITTING TO IS WHAT HAPPENED THAT FATEFUL NIGHT IN\nRIO. >> HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE WAY\nYOU HAVE HANDLED YOURSELF SINCE SUNDAY MORNING, EARLY SUNDAY\nMORNING, WHEN THIS ALL WENT DOWN.\n>> SINCE EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED, I'VE BEEN LAYING LOW,\nJUST NOT -- I MEAN, I HAD THOSE STATEMENTS.\nI'VE TALKED TO YOU. BUT BEFORE I WANTED TO GOUT ON\nON-CAMERA, I WANTED TO REALLY MAKE SURE THOSE OTHER GUYS CAME\nBACK ON U.S. SOIL. AND WHICH I JUST FOUND OUT\nTHAT'S WHY I'M DOING THIS TODAY, IS JIMMY JUST CAME BACK.\nHE WAS THE LAST PERSON TO COME BACK.\n>> LET ME PLAY DEVIL'S ADVOCATE. IF YOU HAD COME OUT AND SET THE\nRECORD STRAIGHT EARLIER, GUNNAR AND JACK MAY NOT HAVE BEEN\nPULLED OFF THE PLANE AND JIMMY MAY HAVE COME BACK EARLIER.\nIF WOULD YOU HAVE TOLD THIS STORY EARLIER COULD YOU HAVE\nSAVED THEM PROBLEMS. >> ABSOLUTELY.\nTHAT'S WHY I'M TAKING FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR MY ACTIONS.\nBECAUSE IF I DIDN'T OVEREXAGGERATE THE STORY.\nTO WHAT I SAID WHEN I DID IT WHEN IT FIRST HAPPENED WITH\nBILLY BUSH AND YOURSELF AND I TOLD YOU THE FULL STORY, NONE OF\nTHIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED. WE WOULDN'T BE HERE.\nWE WOULDN'T BE SITTING HERE DISCUSSING THIS.\n>> SO YOU DIDN'T TELL HIM THE WHOLE TRUTH WHEN YOU SPOKE WITH\nME ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT BY PHONE, YOU DIDN'T TELL ME THE WHOLE\nTRUTH. >> I LEFT DETAILS OUT.\nAND WHICH THAT'S WHY I'M IN THIS MESS IS I LEFT CERTAIN THINGS\nOUT AND I OVEREXAGGERATED ON SOME PARTS OF THE STORY.\n>> ONE OF THE THINGS YOU EMBELLISHED WITH BILLY, WHEN YOU\nTALKED TO BILLY, IS YOU SAID AT SOME POINT AFTER YOU REFUSED TO\nSIT DOWN THE SECURITY GUARD PUT THE GUN TO YOUR HEAD AND DOCKED\nIT. THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN?\n>> THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. I OVEREXAGGERATED THAT PART.\n>> WHY DID YOU DO THAT? >> I DON'T KNOW WHY.\nIT WAS STILL HOURS AFTER THE INCIDENT HAPPHAPPENED.\nI WAS STILL INTOXICATED. I WAS STILL UNDER THE INFLUENCE.\nI'M NOT SAYING I'M MAKING ME BEING INTOXICATED AN EXCUSE, I'M\nNOT DOING THAT AT ALL. IT WAS MY FAULT.\nI SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT. I SHOULDN'T HAVE -- I'M NOT\nSAYING ANYTHING. BUT I OVEREXAGGERATED THAT PART\nAND THE GUN WAS DRAWN BUT NOT AT MY FOREHEAD.\nIT WASN'T COCKED AT MY FOREHEAD. IT WAS TOWARDS MY GENERAL\nDIRECTION. AS CAN YOU SEE IN THE\nSURVEILLANCE, THAT'S WHEN MY HANDS WENT UP.\n>> YOU TOLD ME ON THE FUN, RYAN. YOU SAID, WE ARE VICTIMS HERE.\nWE ARE VICTIMS. AND WE'RE HAPPY THAT WE'RE SAFE.\nAND THE POLICE PRESS CONFERENCE, THEY SAID, THEY'RE NOT VICTIMS,\nTHEY'RE VANDALS. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?\n>> IT IS HOW YOU WANT TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE.\nWHETHER YOU CALL IT A ROBBERY OR WHETHER YOU CALL IT EXTORTION OR\nUS PAYING JUST FOR THE DAMAGES. WE DON'T KNOW.\nALL WE KNOW IS THAT THERE WAS A GUN POINTED IN OUR DIRECTION AND\nWE WERE DEMANDED TO GIVE MONEY. >> AND THAT'S A REALLY\nINTERESTING POINT. I WANT TO TAKE A LITTLE TIME ON\nTHIS. IF I WERE TO ASK YOU THE SAME\nQUESTION AGAIN RIGHT NOW AND SAY WERE YOU ROBBED ON SUNDAY\nMORNING IN RIO, HOW WOULD YOU ANSWER?\n>> I WOULD BE, I CAN'T ANSWER THAT.\nI DON'T KNOW IF -- I WAS INTOX\nINTOXICATED. SO I DON'T KNOW.\nALL I KNOW IS WE HAD A GUN POINTED AT US AND WE WERE\nDEMANDED TO GIVE MONEY. WHETHER IT WAS IT PAY FOR\nDAMAGES OR IT WAS ROBBERY, I'M NOT EQUIPPED TO --\n>> GUNNAR IN HIS STATEMENT SAID, AT SOME POINT SOMEONE WHO SPOKE\nENGLISH WALKED OVER AND OFFERED TO HELP TRANSLATE THIS\nALTERCATION. AND HE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THIS\nSECURITY GUARD WAS TELLING THE FOUR OF YOU, YOU NEED TO PAY FOR\nTHAT STUFF, THAT DAMAGE, BEFORE YOU CAN LEAVE HERE OR I'M GOING\nTO CALL THE POLICE. YOU UNDERSTOOD THAT AT THAT\nTIME, DIDN'T YOU? >> YES BP, SO WE TODAY GIVE THE\nMONEY. >> RIGHT.\nSO AT THAT POINT, IT IS NOT A ROBBERY, AT THAT POINT YOU'RE\nSTRIKING A DEAL. YOU'RE STRIKING A DEAL TO PAY\nFOR WHAT DAMAGE YOU'VE CAUSED SO THAT HE DOESN'T CALL THE POLICE.\nAND THIS DOESN'T BECOME A BIGGER INCIDENT, ISN'T THAT FAIR?\n>> WE JUST WANTED TO GET OUT OF THERE.\nTHERE WAS A GUN POINTED IN OUR DIRECTION.\nWE WERE ALL FRIGHTENED. AND WE WANTED TO GET OUT OF\nTHERE AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE AND THE ONLY WAY WE KNEW IS THIS GUY\nSAYING YOU HAVE TO GIVE HIM MONEY.\nSO WE GAVE MONEY AND WE GOT OUT. >> THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A\nROBBERY. ROBBERY IS WHEN SOME GUY TARGETS\nYOU, WHEN HE IS ARMED OR NOT, TO TAKE YOUR MONEY AND BELONGS AND\nVALUABLES. THIS GUY WAS NEGOTIATING A DEAL\nBECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT WALK WAY AND YOU GUYS WERE ON\nTHE OTHER END OF THAT NEGOTIATION.\n>> THAT'S WHY IT COULD BE -- PEOPLE CAN SEE IT IN MANY\nDIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. ALL WE KNOW IS THERE WAS A GUN\nPOINTED TO US AND WE WERE DEMANDED TO GIVE THEM MONEY.\nAND END OF STORY. >> I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO\nGET AT, THE FIRST VERSION, RYAN, YOU TOLD IS MUCH MORE ABOUT THE\nMEAN STREETS OF RIO. >> YEAH.\n>> AND THE VERSION WE HEAR NOW IS MUCH MORE ABOUT A NEGOTIATED\nSETTLEMENT TO COVER UP SOME DUMB BEHAVIOR.\n>> AND THAT'S WHY I'M TAKING FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT.\nIS BECAUSE I OVEREXAGGERATED THAT STORY AND IF I NEVER HAD\nDONE THAT, WE WOULDN'T BE IN THIS MESS.\nTHOSE GUYS WOULD NEVER BE IN RIO OR WERE IN RIO.\nNOTHING OF THE -- NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED AND IT WAS\nMY IMMATURE BEHAVIOR OF, YOU KNOW, WE JUST FIN IBED.\nWE WERE WANTING TO CELEBRATE. AND WE HADN'T BEEN DRINKING OR\nANYTHING LIKE MONTHS BEFORE THAT.\nAND I DEFINITELY HAD TOO MUCH TO DRINK.\n THAT NIGHT. I WAS VERY INTOXICATED.\nAND NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF I DIDN'T DO THAT.\n>> ALL RIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.\nJOINING ME IS DANNY SAVOLLE, AND, LEE, SIX MINUTES PLUS OF\nTHAT INTERVIEW, WHAT DID YOU GET OUT OF IT?\n>> I GET OUT OF IT THAT HE IS STILL IN THE STATE OF DENIAL.\nFOR 42 YEARS I'VE BEEN REPRESENTING ATHLETES.\nSOMETIMES THEY GO OUT AND DRINK AT NIGHT.\nUSUALLY THEY DON'T KICK DOWN THE DOOR IN A BATHROOM TO GET IT\nOPEN. NORMALLY THEY DON'T VANDALIZE\nIT. NORMALLY THEY KNOW IF THEY DO\nTHAT THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR DAMAGES.\nHAD HE SPOKEN UP QUICKLY. HAD THEY PAID FOR THAT QUICKLY.\nHAD THEY NOT CHOSEN OUT THE POLICE TO VILLAINIZE AS IF THEY\nWERE ROBBED BY POLICE AT GUNPOINT, THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN.\nHE WAITED A WEEK TO DO THIS, A WEEK IN WHICH THE ACHIEVEMENTS\nOF ALL OF THE OLYMPIANS WERE CLOUDED.\nWE COULDN'T SEE 150 MEDAL WINNERS FROM THE UNITED STATES\nBECAUSE IT WAS ALL LOCHTE, LOCHTE, LOCHTE.\nWHAT HE SHOULD HAVE DONE IS HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE THE MINUTES\nTHE WORDS CAME OUT OF HIS MOUTH AND TAKEN RESPONSIBILITY.\nTHERE REALLY WASN'T A LOT OF LEGAL LIABILITY.\nTHERE ARE MANY CASES WHERE VANDALISM IN BRAZIL ENDS UP, AS\nLONG AS YOU MAKE SOME RESTITUTION, NOT EVEN BEING\nPROSECUTED. >> LET ME JUST STOP YOU FOR A\nSECOND. I WILL BRING IN DANNY.\nDANNY, THERE WAS A GUN AND YOU SPOKE TO THIS FACT LAST WEEK.\nAND AFTER THE PRESS CONFERENCE WITH AUTHORITY, YOU SEEMED\nSHOCKED THAT COPS CLAIMED THEY WERE NOT ROBBED.\nSO NOW YOU'VE HEARD THIS INTERVIEW.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK? IS IT EXTORTION?\nSOMETHING ELSE? WHAT DO YOU FEEL LEGALLY THIS\nIS? >> IT IS ODD TO ME.\nIT SEEMS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE LAST WEEK EVERYONE IS\nASTOUNDED THAT THE POLICE EITHER IN BRAZIL OR STATE SIDE MIGHT\nTAKE A POSITION THAT IT IS COMPLETELY OPPOSITE TO SOMEONE\nTHAT MIGHT BE CALLED A SUSPECT. THAT HAPPENED EVERY SINGLE DAY\nIN EVERY COURTHOUSE ACROSS THE LAND.\nTHE POLICE TAKE A POSITION THAT IS DIRECTLY OPPOSITE THAT OF A\nDEFENDANT. I'M HARDLY AN APOLL GIST FOR\nTHIS BEHAVIOR EXHIBITED BY LOCHTE THAT HE ADMITS TO.\nBUT AT THE SAME TIME, I WOULD RESPECTFULLY PUSH BACK A LITTLE\nBIT ON MATT LAUER. THOUGH IT WAS AN OUTSTANDING\nINTERVIEW, MATT LAUER SPEAKS OF IT BEING, THIS IS A NEGOTIATION.\n>> WITH A GUN. >> YEAH.\nTHERE AREN'T A LOT OF NEGOTIATIONS CARRIED ON IN THE\nUNITED STATES WITH ONE PARTY BRANDISHING A FIREARM.\nIT RAISES AN INTERESTING LEGAL QUESTION AS TO WHAT EXACTLY WAS\nBEING DONE WITH THE GUN. WAS IT AT HIS HIP.\nDOES IT MATTER IF IT IS OUT BY HIS BODY OR DOES IT MATTER IF IT\nIS POINTED RIGHT AT YOU? IT IS AN INTERESTING LEGAL\nQUESTION BUT TO SOME DEGREE RYAN LOCHTE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH\nABOUT HAVING A GUNPOINTED IN HIS DIRECTION.\nDID HE EXAGGERATE? YES.\nHE IS TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT, PROBABLY A LITTLE TOO\nLATE. BUT AGAIN AS CRIMINAL DEFENSE\nATTORNEY, HIS ADVISERS SURELY WAITED UNTIL HE WAS ABSOLUTELY\nCERTAIN HE WOULD NOT BE CALLED EXTRADITED BACK IT BRAZIL BEFORE\nHE WENT ON THE APOLOGY TOUR IN AN EFFORT TO SALVAGE HIS BRAND.\n>> THAT PART I FIGURED OUT. HE WOULDN'T BE SAYING WHEN A\nSAID IF IT WOULD STILL BE FOR THE PROSECUTION.\n>> LEE, LET ME ASK YOU THIS. WHAT DO YOU THINK THE FALL-OUT\nWILL BE? FOR SPONSORS AND DISCIPLINARY\nACTION? IS THIS GOING TO HAVE A LONG\nTERM IMPACT ON HIS CAREER? OR IS THIS JUST GOING TO PASS?\n>> THE LAWYERS WANT TO TAKE A VIKT POSITION OF SITTING BACK\nAND DOING THE FACTS AND WHERE FROM MARKETING STANDPOINT, THE\nISSUE IS BRAND. SO THIS IS A --\n>> SO WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF THE BRAND?\n>> THE IMPACT OF THE BRAND IS DEVASTATING.\nBECAUSE FOR A WHOLE WEEK YOU'VE HAD NEWS CYCLE AVENUES CYCLE,\nYESTERDAY IN NEW YORK, YOU HAVE UGLY AMERICAN ON THE FRONT OF\nONE OF THE TABLOIDS AND THE OTHER ONE IS THE LOCHTE MONSTER.\nAND IT'S GONE ON AND ON AND ON WITHOUT ANY REACTION AND IT\nBRANDS HIM IN A NEGATIVE WAY AND HE'S GOT A SERIES OF\nENDORSEMENTS. I THINK THEY WILL BACK AWAY.\nSECOND THING IS, RESENTMENT AMONG THE OTHER OLYMPIANS\nCOMPETING BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN DROWN OUT.\nNOW AS TO SANCTIONS I WOULD GUESS THAT THEY ARE ARE GOING TO\nSLAP HIM WITH A BAND AND THE U.S. OC CERTAINLY THE SWIMMING\nFEDERATION FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME.\nLOOK, HE DIDN'T -- HE DIDN'T COMMIT MURDER AND WITH THE\nPROPER APOLOGY, WE LOOK TO FORGIVE AND HE COULD GO ON.\nTHE COME BACK FOLLOWS THE FOLLOW THE HIGH AND MIGHTY.\nBUT THIS IS LINGERED FOR SO LONG WITHOUT AN APPROPRIATE RESPONSE.\nIT'S ALL BEEN LEGALISTIC. IT HASN'T BEEN THE HUNDREDS OF\nMILLIONS OF PEOPLE WATCHING THESE BROADCASTS WHO THINK OF\nHIM AS A -- SOMEONE WHO HAS NO REGARD FOR OTHER PEOPLE.\n>> LEE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DANNY, THANKS FOR YOUR INSIGHTS\nALSO. I HOPE WE WON'T TALK ABOUT THIS\nMUCH MORE BUT WE WILL SEE AS",

I DON'T WANT LITTLE KIDS TO LOOK\nAT ME FOR WHAT I JUST DID, FOR THAT ONE NIGHT.\nI DON'T WANT THAT.

GREAT QUESTION.\nI DON'T KNOW THAT HE'S GOING TO MAKE IT TO TOKYO.\nI WOULD HAVE SAID THAT EVEN BEFORE ALL THIS HAPPENED.\nHE'S 32 YEARS OLDS. HE WOULD BE 36 IN TOKYO.\nTHAT'S A BIG FOUR YEARS FOR A SWIMMER.\nHE DID WIN ONE GOLD MEDAL HERE IN THE RELAY.\nHIS OLYMPIC TRIALS A MONTH OR TWO AGO AND HIS GAMES HERE WERE\nNOWHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS THE PREVIOUS OLYMPICS.\nHE'S CERTAINLY ON THE DOWNSIDE OF HIS CAREER.\nANYTHING'S POSSIBLE AS WE'VE SEEN, BUT WHEN HE'S SUSPENDED\nFOR SOME LENGTH OF TIME, THEN IF HE HAS A CHANCE TO COME BACK,\nSURE HE'S GOING TO HAVE A SHOT AT IT, BUT I THINK IT'S VERY\nDIFFICULT FOR HIM TO COME BACK AS A SWIMMER.\n>> WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS INTERVIEW, HE GETS EMOTIONAL\nWHEN HE SPEAKS ABOUT HIS TEAMMATES.\nWHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REPERCUSSIONS AND THE\nCONSEQUENCES HERE, SHOULD HE BE BANNED?\nYOU SAY HE'S GOING TO BE SUSPENDED FOR SOME LENGTH OF\nTIME.

YOU'RE STRIKING A DEAL TO PAY\nFOR WHAT DAMAGED YOU'VE CAUSED SO HE DOESN'T CALL THE POLICE\nAND THIS DOESN'T BECOME A BIGGER INCIDENT.\nISN'T THAT FAIR? >> WE JUST WANTED TO GET OUT OF\nTHERE. THERE WAS A GUN POINTED IN OUR\nDIRECTION. WE WERE ALL FRIGHTENED AND WE\nWANTED TO GET OUT OF THERE AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE.\nTHE ONLY WAY WE KNEW WAS TO SAY THIS GUY WANTS YOU TO GIVE HIM\nMONEY. >> THAT'S NOT A ROBBERY.\nA ROBBERY IS WHEN SOME GUY TARGETS YOU WHETHER ARMED OR\nNOT, TO TAKE YOUR MONEY AND BELONGINGS AND VALUABLES.\nTHIS GUY WAS NEGOTIATING A DEAL BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT\nWALKWAY AND YOU GUYS WERE ON THE OTHER END OF THAT NEGOTIATION.\n>> PEOPLE CAN SEE IT IN MANY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.\nALL WE KNOW IS THERE WAS A GUN POINTED TO US AND WE WERE\nDEMANDED TO GIVE THEM MONEY, END OF STORY.\n>> THE FIRST VERSION OF THE STORY YOU TOLD RYAN WAS MUCH\nMORE ABOUT THE MEAN STREETS OF RIO.\nAND THE VERSION WE'RE HEARING NOW IS MUCH MORE ABOUT A\nNEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT TO COVER UP SOME DUMB BEHAVIOR.\n>> AND THAT'S WHY I'M TAKING FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT, IS\nBECAUSE I OVEREXAGGERATED THAT STORY.\nIF I HAD NEVER DONE THAT, WE WOULDN'T BE IN THIS MESS.\nTHOSE GUYS WOULD NEVER BE IN RIO OR WERE IN RIO.\nNONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED AND IT WAS MY IMMATURE BEHAVIOR.\nYOU KNOW, WE JUST FINISHED. WE WERE WANTING TO CELEBRATE.\nAND WE HAVEN'T BEEN DRINKING OR ANYTHING LIKE MONTHS BEFORE\nTHAT. AND I DEFINITELY HAD TOO MUCH TO\nDRINK THAT NIGHT AND I WAS VERY INTOXICATED.\nNONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF I DIDN'T DO THAT.\n>> ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS, WE'VE GOT HANGING IN THE AIR\nHERE FOR RYAN LOCHTE NOT ONLY HIS ENDORSEMENTS BUT HIS FUTURE\nIN THIS SPORT. HE SAYS HE STILL HAS MORE TO\nACCOMPLISH IF GIVEN THE CHANCE. LET'S TALK ABOUT IF THIS COULD\nFORCE HIM INTO EARLY RETIREMENT. FIRST OF ALL, AS YOU LISTENED TO\nTHAT, WHAT STOOD OUT TO YOU IN THIS INTERVIEW?\n>> IT'S GOOD TO HEAR RYAN LOCHTE TAKE MORE RESPONSIBILITY FOR\nTHIS INCIDENT THAT BASICALLY TOOK OVER FIVE, SIX DAYS OF THE\nOLYMPIC GAMES. HE IS SAYING MUCH MORE AND\nTHAT'S WHAT HE SHOULD BE DOING. CLEARLY HE HAS GOT A P.R. FIRM\nWORKING WITH HIM AND WHAT A TERRIBLE JOB THEY HAVE DONE.\nTHE APOLOGY THAT WAS MORE OF AN EXPLANATION CAME OUT A COUPLE OF\nDAYS AGO. IT WAS LONG, IT WAS WINDING, IT\nWAS STILL TRYING TO EXPLAIN THINGS AWAY.\nHE APOLOGIZED TO HIS SPONSORS FIRST BEFORE HE APOLOGIZED TO\nTHE PEOPLE RUNNING THE RIO OLYMPICS.\nTHAT WAS CLEARLY NOT WELL RECEIVED SO NOW THEY'RE COMING\nBACK WITH THIS. IT'S HARD NOT TO LOOK AT RYAN\nLOCHTE AND SAY HE'S DOING THIS ONLY BECAUSE HE HAS TO BECAUSE\nHE REALIZES HOW MUCH TROUBLE HE'S IN.\n>> SO YOU BELIEVE HE IS SORRY? >> IT SOUNDS LIKE HE'S SORRY,\nBUT THE MOTIVATION FOR BEING SORRY -- I THINK THIS AVALANCHE\nOF NEGATIVE PUBLICITY HAS HIT HIM.\nHE'S A SWIMMER. HE'S 32 YEARS OLD.\nHE'S NOT A TEENAGER. THERE'S SO MANY QUESTIONS TO ASK\nABOUT HIS BEHAVIOR BASED ON HIS BEING 32 YEARS OLD.\nBUT TO HAVE PRODEPOFESSIONALS AD YOU, THIS IS A MAN WHO IS\nSUSPENDED AND IS TRYING TO GET A LESSER SUSPENSION.\n>> HE DID TALK ABOUT HIS HOPES FOR THE FUTURE, SAYING THAT HE\nWANTS TO CONTINUE SWIMMING IF THEY ALLOW HIM TO DO SO.\nWE KNOW MICHAEL PHELPS CAME BACK FROM TWO DUIS AND LOOK AT WHERE\nHE WOUND UP. HE DID THAT BECAUSE HE WAS\nCONTRITE, HE TOOK RESPONSIBILITY.\nDO YOU THINK THAT IS POSSIBLE FOR RYAN LOCHTE?\n>> I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE THAT HE WILL SWIM AGAIN AND BE ABLE TO\nBE A SPOKESPERSON FOR USA SWIMMING AND SHOW UP AT EVENTS\nAND DO MEET AND GREETS THAT ALL ALUMS KIND OF DO.\nTHERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT HE WAS EVEN GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE\nTHE 2020 OLYMPIC TEAM. I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE TALKING\nABOUT THAT. HE'S 32.\nHE'LL BE 36.

I THINK THOSE THINGS HAVE\nCLOUDED A LOT OF THE OTHERWISE INTERESTING STORIES ABOUT THE\nATHLETES. >> JUST TO RETURN IT TO THE\nATHLETE, DAN, I LOVE THE STORY OF THE CONTINUING RISE OF THE\nAMERICAN DISTANCE RUNNER. FOR TWO DECADES OR MORE, WE JUST\nDIDN'T REALLY DO VERY WELL. NOW YOU SEE AMERICAN DISTANCE\nRUNNERS COMPETING ACROSS NEARLY EVERY RACE.\nJENNIFER SIMPSON WON THE FIRST WOMAN'S MEDAL FOR AN AMERICAN\nNEVER THE 1500 METERS. AND WE WON STEEPLECHASE MEDALS\nIN FOR MEN AND WOMEN. I LOVE THAT TENSION IN THE RACE\nBETWEEN THE ENDURANCE AND THE SPEED AT THE END.\nYOU NEVER KNOW WHO IS GOING TO KICK TO FINALLY WIN THE RACE.\n>> YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE EXTRAORDINARY TRAINING AND\nTALENT THAT THESE ATHLETES DISPLAY ACROSS THE BOARD IN THE\nOLYMPICS. AND I THINK TO PICK UP KIM'S\nPOINT, THEY NEED A VENUE IN WHICH THEY CAN DISPLAY THOSE\nTALENTS. THE 2022 WINTER OLYMPICS ARE\nBEING HELD IN BEIJING, WHICH HAS NO SNOW.\nTHEY'RE BEING HELD THERE -- >> THERE MAY BE BLACK SNOW IF\nTHEY HAVE IT FROM SOOT OR COAL. >> THEY'RE BEING HELD THERE\nBECAUSE THE OLYMPICS HAVE BECOME TOO EXPENSIVE.\nSWEDEN, NORWAY AND POLAND PULLED THEIR BIDS FOR THE WINTER\nOLYMPICS BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD IT.\nIT'S BECOMING VERY DIFFICULT TO PUT ON A REPUTABLE OLYMPICS.\nAND THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE HAS GOT TO GO BACK TO\nTHE DRAWING BOARD ABOUT THE WAY THEY PUT THESE OLYMPICS\nTOGETHER. >> WITH A GOAL OF WHAT?\nPUTTING IN ONE SPECIFIC LOCATION?\n>> ONE OR SEVERAL VENUES THAT ARE PERMANENT, PEOPLE ARE\nTRAINED IN DOING IT, WHERE THE VENUES ARE LIVING UP TO THE\nSTANDARDS. >> THE INFRASTRUCTURE CAN BE\nREUSED. THAT'S THE PROBLEM.\nTHE RICH COUNTRIES, YOU BUILD THESE STRUCTURES, YOU TAKE ON\nALL THIS DEBT. AND THEN THEY BECOME GHOST TOWNS\nATTEND. THEY'RE NEVER USED AGAIN.\nWHEN YOU GO INTO A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY OR A LESS RICH\nCOUNTRIES, YOU A STRONG MAN OR AUTHORITARIAN DEALING WITH\nCONTRACTORS, ENRICHING THEMSELVES.\nI THINK A PERMANENT LOCATION WOULD ALLOW FOR THE\nINFRASTRUCTURE TO BE REUSED. AND THAT WOULD MAKE A LOT MORE\nECONOMIC SENSE. >> IF YOU PUT IT IN A PERMANENT\nLOCATION, THAT PROVIDES A PERMANENT ADVANTAGE FOR WHEREVER\nTHAT IS. I'M NOT SAYING IF YOU PUT IT --\nSO YOU PUT IT IN EUROPE, THE EUROPEANS WOULD HAVE AN\nADVANTAGE. YOU PUT IT IN ASIA, THE ASIANS\nWOULD HAVE AN AGREEMENT. NOBODY IS GOING TO AGREE TO PUT\nIT IN THE UNITED STATES. I CAN TELL YOU THAT.\nIS THAT REALLY A POSSIBLE OUTCOME?\n>> IT'S PROBABLY NOT. LOOK AT THE FIGHTING THAT GUESS\nON NOW WHEREBY THE OLYMPICS IS GOING TO BE HELD OVER TIME AND\nTHE BIDDING THAT GOES ON. PEOPLE REALLY CARE ABOUT THIS.\nIT'S TRUE THERE HAVE BEEN PLACES THAT HAVE BEEN PULLING THEIR\nBIDS BECAUSE OF WORRIES ABOUT COSTS AND ECONOMICS OR DOWNTURN.\nBUT I THINK THAT JUST THE IDEA THAT AND THE ADVANTAGE, THIS IS\nONE OF THOSE THINGS, WE GOT TO REMEMBER THAT COUNTRIES ARE VERY\nPROUD TO GET TO HOLD THIS IN THEIR HOME PLACES.\n>> KIM, THANKS. WE HAVE TO TAKE ONE MORE BREAK.\nWHEN WE COME BACK, HITS AND MISSES OF THE WEEK.",

THE CONFLICT IN SYRIA IS IRAQ IS\nVERY COMPLEX AND THERE ARE MORE THAN TWO SIDES.\nWHILE THE INSTANT REACTION MIGHT BE THAT THIS MEANS THAT TURKEY\nWILL TAKE MORE STEPS AGAINST ISIS, IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT --\nTHAT'S THE WAY THEY ARE GOING TO GO.\nWILL THEY GIVE UP THE WAR AGAINST ASSAD, AND DOES THAT\nMEAN THEY GIVE UP THE FORCES OPPOSED TO ASSAD?\nAND DOES THAT MEAN FOR THE PEOPLE IN TURKEY?\nI DON'T THINK IT'S A QUESTION OF THE STABILITY OF TURKEY, BUT THE\nDIRECTION THEY WILL GO IN. >> WE JUST SHOWED A PHOTOGRAPH\nOF HE WITH PUTIN, AND HE WAS PRAISING PUTIN, AND THEY ARE\nTIPPING TO RUSSIA. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN WILL BE\nTHERE ON WEDNESDAY. WHAT CAN HE SAY?\nWHAT WILL HE SAY? >> WELL, I THINK WE'RE VERY\nCLOSE TO THE POINT WHERE TURKEY IS GOING TO SPIN OUT OF THE\nWESTERN ORBIT ENTIRELY. ERDOWAN IS GETTING USED TO THE\nSECULAR CONSTITUTION, AND USING THE FAILED MILITARY COUP TO WIPE\nOUT HIS POLITICAL OPPOSITION. THERE WAS NEWS FROM TURKEY THAT\nRELEASED THEY RELEASED 30,000 CRIMINAL PRISONERS, TO MAKE ROOM\nFOR THE POLITICAL PRISONERS THAT HE IS ARRESTING.\nAND I THINK THE REPORTS OF POSSIBLY ALLOWING RUSSIAN PLANES\nTO USE THE BASE COMBINED WITH RUSSIAN PLANES USING AIR BASES\nIN IRAN TO ATTACK OPPONENTS OF THE ASSAD REGIME, ALL OF THIS\nPUT IN CONTEXT REFLECTS A DRAMATIC DEMOLITION OVER\nAMERICAN INFLUENCE, AND THE REGION AS A WHOLE.\nIT'S VERY DANGEROUS, AND BIDEN OUGHT TO BE HAVING A VERY\nSTRAIGHT CONVERSATION. WITH YOU PART OF THE WEST OR\nNOT? >> IT SEEMS HE IS NOT.\nYOU MENTIONED THE NATO AIR BASE THERE.\nSTUNNINGLY, THE PRIME MINISTER SAID THEY MAY ALLOW RUSSIAN\nFORCES TO USE A NATO BASE. LOOK AT WHAT THE FOREIGN\nMINISTER SAID ABOUT THIS. QUOTE, IT SEEMS TO US THAT NATO\nMEMBERS BEHAVE IN AN EVASIVE FASHION ON ISSUES SUCH AS THE\nEXCHANGE OFFING TO AND JOINT INVESTMENTS.\nTURKEY INTENDS TO STRENGTHEN ITS DEFENSE SYSTEM, AND WE ARE READY\nTO CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF COOPERATION IN THIS SECTOR.\nIS THIS THE LANGUAGE OF AN ALLY? IS THIS THE LANGUAGE OF A TRUE\nNATO COUNTRY? >> ABSOLUTELY NOT.\nAND I DON'T THINK THE U.S. AND NATO WANT TO LOSE TURKEY GIVEN\nITS CRITICAL GEOGRAPHIC POSITION AND THE ROLE IT'S PLAYED IN THE\nPAST AND IT COULD PLAY IN THE FUTURE.\nI DON'T THINK A MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE WANT TO GO IN THIS\nDIRECTION. BUT IT MAY BE OUT OF THEIR HANDS\nGIVEN THE CONTROL OVER THE JUDICIARY AND MILITARY AND\nPOLITICAL SYSTEM. HE SAID WHEN HE WAS MAYOR OF\nISTANBUL, DEMOCRACY IS LIKE A STREETCAR.\nYOU DRIVE IT WHERE YOU WANT AND GET OFF.\nHE IS GETTING OFF. HE IS OUT OF NATO ALLIANCE, AND\nTHAT'S WHY BIDEN SHOULD NOT MINCE WORDS.\n>> WHAT WOULD IT MEAN IF RUSSIA LANDED AT THE BASE?\nWHAT WOULD THAT MEAN STRUCTURE AND STABILITY OF THE WESTERN\nWORLD AND DEPENDENCE ON THAT NATION?\n>> WE HAVE A CONFLICT WITH SYRIA AND IRAQ AGAINST ISIS, AND IN\nOTHER STRATEGIC REGIONS.

SO DRIVERS HAVE TO STAY WITH\nTHEIR CARS THAT'S A GOOD SIGN MEANING THEY\nHOPE THIS WILL BE GOING BACK TO GREEN SHORTLY.\nWE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY WE CAN CHAT WITH AUSTIN DILLON, DRIVER\nOF THE NUMBER THREE. >> IT'S JEFF UP IN THE WOBOOTH.\nYOU WITH US? >> I GOT YOU\n>> YOU HAD A GREAT WEEK. YOU GOT ENGAGED.\nYOU WON THE XFINITY RACE FRIDAY NIGHT.\nWHAT'S IT GOING TO TAKE TO CAP THE WEEK OFF\n>> NOT THE BEST CAR TODAY BUT STAYING UP HERE AND FOCUSSED ON\nTRYING TO MAKE IT BETTER EACH TIME\nTHEY'VE DONE A GREAT JOB PICKED US UP THE LAST PIT STOP\nPROUD OF THEM. TRYING TO FINISH IT OFF HERE\n>> WE TALKED ABOUT THE LAST RESTART, NEEDING A LITTLE BETTER\nRESTART. EXPLAIN WHY IT'S DIFFICULT TO\nRESTART IN THIRD OR FOURTH PLACE.\n>> YOU JUST GOT TO TIME IT REALLY GOOD.\nTHE TIME SEEMS TO GAIN THE MOMENTUM DOWN THE FRONT STRETCH.\nMY CAR WAS TIGHT IN TURN ONE COULDN'T GET THROUGH THERE AS\nGOOD AS I WANTED TO. I JUST NEED TO TIME IT A LITTLE\nBETTER AND MIGHT GET TO SLCLEAR SECOND\nI'M JUST TRYING TO STAY FOCUSSED HERE\n>> YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE IN THE LANE YOU WANT TO BE IN\nYOU THINK THAT'S WHERE YOU WANT TO BE?\n>> I THINK SO. YOU I THINK YOU GET THE MOMENTUM\nROLLING OFF THE CORNER YOU THE OPTION OF GETTING DOWN\nOR STAYING UP. IT WILL BE INTERESTING\nIT HOLD ON FOR ABOUT 20 OR 30 LAPS AND THEN THE TOP STARTS\nCOMING IN. EVERY TIME IT SEEMS LIKE WE\nRESTARTED, THE TRACK CHANGED THE LONG RUN IT FELT LIKE THE\nTOP WAS RUBBERED UP AND GUYS MADE THE MOMENTUM ON THE BOTTOM.\n>> THANK YOU FOR TAKING TIME TO TALK TO THE FANS A LITTLE BIT\nAND GOOD LUCK. >> THANKS, JEFF.\n>> THAT'S THE CREW CHIEFS ON THEIR CELL PHONE\nCOMMUNICATING AS WE LOOK AT THE BUBBLE DRIVERS\nWHERE THEY'RE RUNNING. AUSTIN DILLON, 13th IN THE CHASE\nSTANDINGS. RUNNING FOURTH, NEWMAN\n27th, KYLE LARSON. 25th --\n>> IT JUST SEEMS LIKE AUSTIN DILLON IS GOING OUT AND DOING\nWHAT HE NEEDS TO DO. HE'S TAKING THE POSITIONS.\nGLENN WE SAW POINTS LOST LATE. INDIANAPOLIS, ACCIDENTS LATE IN\nTHAT RACE. I HEARD A LOT OF THE BUBBLE\nDRIVERS. IT SEEMS LIKE EVEN AS THE\nPRESSURE MOUNTS TO MAKE THE CHASE, NO ONE HAS JUST REACHED\nUP AND KIND OF GRABBED THE OPPORTUNITY.\nWE SEE I DON'T WANT TO CALL THEM MISTAKES\nJUST A LOT OF TEAMS NOT CAPITALIZING ON THE OPPORTUNITY.\n>> RIGHT >> AGAIN, UNDER A HOPEFULLY\nSLIGHT DELAY AS THEY ARE DRYING THE TRACK.\nIT STOPPED RAINING SO THE TRACK DRYING UNDERWAY\nDID NOT LOSE THE TRACK IT WASN'T SO BAD THAT IT WILL\nTAKE THE 40 MINUTES IT HAS TAKEN EARLIER TO DRY THE TRACK\nIT SHOULD BE A FEW MORE MOMENTS BEFORE THEY'RE ABLE TO LET THE\nCARS GET GOING ONCE AGAIN. ROLLING AROUND THE TRACK\n55 LAPS TO GO IN THIS ONE. THE GUY OUT FRONT IS KEVIN\nHARVICK. WE CAN ALSO CHAT WITH HIM.\nJEFF, ONCE YOU DIAL UP THE FOUR. >> YOU GOT A MOMENT TO TALK TO\nUS >> SURE.\n>> YOU SOUND CALM WITH 55 TO GO. YOU HAVE A FAST RACE CAR\nWHAT'S IT GOING TO TAKE TO FINISH IT OFF?\n>> I THINK GETTING THE LEAD TO GET CONTROL OF THE RESTART\nHOPEFULLY IT WILL GET US A GOOD RESTART.\nAND TRY NOT TO COME OFF THE BOTTOM FOR A FEW LAPS AND GET\nCONTROL OF THE RACE THERE. I THINK THAT'S THE KEY IS\nKEEPING CONTROL OF THE RACE, AND SEE WHERE IT GOES FROM THERE\n>> YOU GOT A LOT OF NEW CARS AROUND YOU\nTHINGS HAVE CHANGED SO MUCH. HAVE YOU HAD TIME TO EVALUATE\nTHE PEOPLE BEHIND YOU AND UNDERSTAND WHO THE CARS ARE TO\nBEAT >> I JUST DON'T WANT TO BEAT\nOURSELVES AT THIS POINT. OBVIOUSLY ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.\nJUST TRYING TO CONTROL THE THINGS THAT WE CAN WITH OUR BUSH\nBEER CHEVY, AND NOT MAKE ANY MISTAKES AND GO FROM THERE\n>> THANK YOU FOR TAKING TIME AND GOOD LUCK, KEVIN\n>> THANK YOU >> KEVIN HARVICK HAS BEEN OUT\nFRONT FOR 73 LAPS TODAY. KYLE BUSCH HAD LEAD 256 BEFORE A\nPART BROKE IN HIS CAR. AND SHOWN A DOMINANT RACE CAR.\nNOW IT'S KEVIN HARVICK WHO LOOKS LIKE HE'S THE STRONGEST CAR ON\nTHE TRACK. >> AND EVERYONE THAT IS IN THE\nCHASE, THOSE WINS, THREE BONUS POINTS IN ROUND ONE.\nSO YOU LOOK AT KEVIN HARVICK LAST YEAR, A LITTLE BIT OF A\nSLOW PART. HE DID WIN THAT RACE IN ADVANCE.\nBUT IF HE COULD WIN HERE TODAY OR DENNY HAMLIN BEHIND HIM,\nJIMMY JOHNSON BEHIND HIM, THOSE THREE CARS WANT TO WIN AS BAD AS\nAUSTIN DILLON BECAUSE OF THE BONUS POINTS\nEVERYONE KNOWS HOW FRAGILE THE ROUNDS ARE\nIF YOU HAVE AN ISSUE OR A MECHANICAL OR CRASH, YOU'RE\nGOING TO NEED ALL THE BONUS POINTS YOU CAN TO GUARANTEE\nMOVING THROUGH ROUND ONE >> WE'VE HEARD FROM KEVIN\nHARVICK. WE'VE HEARD FROM AUSTIN DILLON\nHOW ABOUT WE CHAT WITH DENNY HAMLIN AS WELL\n>> DENNY, IT'S JEFF. YOU GOT A MOMENT TO TALK\nYOU GUYS MADE A GREAT STRATEGY CALL WITH TWO TIRES.\nHOW'S IT WORKING >> IT'S NOT BAD.\nOUR CAR HAS BEEN PRETTY GOOD ON THE SHORT RUN.\nWE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DO LAP SHOOT OUT.\nA LITTLE BIT OF A TIRE DISADVANTAGE WITH THE GUYS\nAROUND US, BUT I THINK OUR CAR IS FAST ENOUGH\nWE'LL HANG IN AND TRY TO CHALLENGE FOR THE WIN.\n>> THE INSIDE LANE, DIFFICULT ON RESTARTS, EVEN WHEN YOU LEAD NOT\nJUST AT TURN ONE, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO TO TRY TO COMBAT\nSNIRT. >> TRY TO DO THE BEST I CAN.\nYOU KNOW, IF EVERYONE HAS BEEN STRUGGLING WITH IT FOR SURE.\nFOR WHATEVER REASON IT SEEMS LIKE THAT BOTTOM LINE NEEDS HEAT\nFOR THE TIRES TO GRIP TO IT. SO I'M SURE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE\nANY BETTER HERE AFTER THIS RAIN. >> ALL RIGHT\nGOOD LUCK TO YOU AND YOUR TEAM >> STILL AMAZED ME HOW MUCH\nACCESS WE'RE ABLE TO HAVE TO THE DRIVERS.\nWITH 50-SOME LAPS TO GO. >> WE TALKED TO THREE OF THE TOP\nFOUR IN THE HEAT OF THE BATTLE.\nTHEY JUST WENT IN THIS RACE MEANING A LOT.\nI THINK WHEN YOU WIN A RACE THEY THINK IT DOESN'T MATTER.\nIT DOES MATTER THOSE BONUS POINTS ARE HUGE.\nWE'VE SEEN THE CHAMPIONSHIP WON BY ONE POINT, A TIE.\nPOINTS MATTER. SO BEING ABLE TO GET THESE BONUS\nPOINTS FOR AUSTIN, FOR THOSE DRIVERS TO TAKE TIME TO TALK TO\nUS IS UNBELIEVABLE >> LET'S LISTEN BACK TO THE\nTHREE RADIOS. >> IN FRONT OF YOU ALL ONE RACER\nTHIS YEAR. THEY REALLY GOT NOTHING TO LOSE,\nAND WE'LL MAKE THIS CHANGE HERE. IT'S GOING TO BE EASIER.\n>> AUSTIN DILLON HAS THE MOST POINTS OF DRIVERS LOOKING TO\nMAKE THEIR WAY IN. >> DOES THAT MEAN BE CAREFUL OF\nTHE TOP THREE OR PUSH THEM >> BE AGGRESSIVE AROUND THE TOP\nTHREE. >> THOSE GUYS HAVE A LOT TO GAIN\nBY BONUS POINTS BUT NOTHING TO LOSE\nDILLON HAS A LITTLE BIT TO LOSE RIGHT NOW AS IT GOES\nTHESE 56 POINTIS GOOD TO MAKING THE CHASE.\nWINNING IMMEDIATELY PUTS YOU IN. >> HARVICK MENTIONED BEING IN\nCONTROL. HE'S THE CONTROL CAR AS THEY\nREENTER THE RESTART ZONE >> GOOD RESTART BY AUSTIN.\n>> AUSTIN TRYING TO CLEAR THE 11 OF DENNY HAMLIN GOING THROUGH\nONE AND TWO. >> HE DID EXACTLY WHAT HE NEEDED\nTO DO. NOW HE'S IN POSITION\n>> GREAT RESTART FOR AUSTIN DILLON\nDENNY HAMLIN TRYING TO HANG ON FOR THE THIRD SPOT\nHERE COMES RICKY STENHOUSE JUNIOR\nHE'S TRYING TO TAKE THIRD AWAY >> YOU MENTIONED HOW HARD 17 WAS\nDRIVING ON THE CORNER. IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF\nAGGRESSION HE KNOWS THIS IS ONE OF HIS BEST\nTRACKS A WIN HERE IS REALLY I FEEL\nMAYBE HIS ONLY OPTION BEFORE THE CHASE.\n>> HIGH ON THE RACETRACK GOES RICKY STENHOUSE JUNIOR\nBATTLE FOR THE LEAD. AUSTIN DILLON TO THE BOTTOM OF\nTHE RACETRACK. KEVIN HARVICK UP HIGH.\n>> WE DON'T KNOW THE CARS SAT FOR A LONG TIME.\nTHE AIR PRESSURE CHANGES WEREN'T ABLE TO PUT TIRES ON\nTHOSE CARS SITTING MAY FAVOR SOME CARS MORE THAN OTHERS.\n>> DILLON CONTINUES TO LOOK AT THE BOTTOM OF THE RACETRACK.\nHARVICK RUNNING UP HIGH. JUST HOW CLOSE THEY ARE,\nAVERAGING OVER 130 MILES PER HOUR AROUND THIS HALF MILE\n>> THINK ABOUT THESE YOUNG DRIVERS, YOU KNOW, TWO OF THE\nTOP THREE ARE YOUNG DRIVERS WITHOUT A CUP WIN.\nIMAGINE WHAT THEY FEEL LIKE RIGHT NOW WITH LESS THAN 50 TO\nGO YOU CAN SEE THE LEADER AT WR\nBRISTOL. >> STENHOUSE JUNIOR WITHOUT A\nWIN. HIS BEST FINISH A SECOND PLACE\nFINISH HERE. DILLON, HIS CAREER BEST AT\nTALLADEGA EARLIER THIS YEAR. >> THE ROAD IS LONG WITH KEVIN\nHARVICK. YOU CAN HEAR HIM, HE WAS NOT\nABLE TO BE IN THE THROTTLE AND STAY WITH IT\nTHAT TELLS ME WITH THE LITTLE BIT OF RAIN, HE'S LOSING A\nLITTLE BIT OF HANDLING WITH HIS CAR.\n>> HAMLIN, STENHOUSE JUNIOR, P\nBUSHER CAN'T FORGET ABOUT CHRIS\nBUSCHER. NEEDING TO GO INTO THE TOP 30.\nNOW RUNNING IN THE TOP FIVE. TOP 30 IN POINTS\nLET'S TALK ABOUT STRATEGY. >>.\n>> UNDER 43 TO GO. >> WE TALKED ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT\nTHE LANE IS. THE TOP LANE HAS BEEN DOMINANT\nBEFORE HARVICK, IT TAKES A FEW LAPS FOR HIM TO GET GOING.\nAFTER A FEW LAPS HE PULLS AWAY 17 IS THE OPPOSITE\nHE FIRES OFF REALLY GOOD ON THE RESTART.\nWILL WE HAVE MORE CAUTIONS WILL THE RESTART AND SHORT RUN\nSPEED COME INTO EFFECT >> WILL WE HAVE ANOTHER RESTART\nOR CAUTION BIG QUESTIONS.\nDENNY HAMLIN FIGHTING PAST THE THREE.\nTALKED TO DILLON HE DID EVERYTHING HE NEEDED ON\nTHE RESTART. THE CAR IS JUST NOT QUITE GOOD\nENOUGH TO STAY IF HE CAN HOLD CHRIS BUSHER\nBEHIND HIM, HE'LL HAVE ANOTHER SHOT\nIF WE GET ANOTHER RESTART TO START IN THE FOURTH POSITION\nI THINK THAT'S BETTER THAN SECOND OR THIRD.\n>> A TOP FIVE RUN AT BRISTOL >> McMURRAY NEEDED SOLID\nFINISHES TO PUT HIMSELF INTO THE PLAYOFF SITUATION.\nALL THESE CARS HAVE BEEN REALLY GOOD\nBIG IMPLICATIONS FOR ALL OF THEM\n>> ALL THESE POINTS TO BE GAINED HERE\nJAMIE MURRAY AMONG THEM. THESE GUYS ARE TRYING TO POINT\nTHEIR WAY INTO THE CHASE AND HOW ABOUT THE RECOVERY FOR\nTHE GUY IN FRONT OF THEM, CHRIS BUSHER\nCAME IN FOURTH A MOMENT AGO. CAME OUT 12th.\nHE WAS ABLE TO MAKE HIS WAY BACK UP TO THE FIELD.\nA NICE RECOVERY FOR CHRIS BUSHER\nAND THE TWO GUYS IN SECOND AND THIRD, THEY'RE THE SAME GUYS\nTHAT GOT SPEEDING PENALTIES ON THE FIRST STOP\nTHEY HAVE RALLIED BACK STENHOUSE JUNIOR AND HAMLIN WANT\nA CHANCE TO WIN THIS RACE. AND WE SAW ON THE BUBBLE EARLIER\nHOW KYLE LARSON HAD FALLEN SO FAR BEHIND\nTHEY HAD A CUT OIL LINE. THEY HAD TO REPLACE THAT\nTHAT'S WHY KYLE LARSON FELL BACK SO MANY SPOTS.\n>> STENHOUSE JUNIOR SPENT MANY LAPS TWO LAPS DOWN\n64 LAPS OF THIS RACE AND NOW HE'S BEEN ABLE TO BATTLE\nBACK AS HAS DENNY HAMLIN WHO IS ALSO TWO LAPS DOWN\nBATTLES BACK AND RUNNING SECOND AND THIRD.\nKEVIN HARVICK HAS DEFINITELY BEEN THE STRONGEST TODAY\nESPECIALLY LATE IN THIS RACE NOW A SECOND AND A HALF LEAD\nOVER HRICKY STENHOUSE JUNIOR >> IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE\nAN ISSUE FOR THE FOUR. HE'S DONE A GREAT JOB THE FIRST\nTHREE PULLING AWAY FROM THE 17 IT'S THE LITTLE EASY FOR\nHARVICK. HE WAS THE LEADER.\nDRIVERS ARE RACING HIM HARDER, NOT TRYING TO GO A LAP DOWN.\nSTENHOUSE HAS TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHEN HE TRIES TO MAKE THE\nMOVE IF HE DOES IT AT THE RIGHT TIME,\nTHE 11 WILL SNEAK BY HIM HE CAN'T JUST DRIVE IT IN\nWHEREVER HE WANTS. KEVIN CAN DRIVE WITHOUT PLAYING\nDEFENSE AT ALL >> KEVIN HARVICK A BAD\nQUALIFYING ON FRIDAY, ADAM STARTING 24 th\nHE'S BEEN ABLE TO OVERCOME THAT, WORK HIS WAY UP TO THE FRONT\nNOW IN THE LEAD UNDER 30 LAPS TO GO\nAT BRISTOL TO GET HIS SECOND BRISTOL WIN.\n>> MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE PACE THEM TO THE END OR SOMETHING\n>> SURE. .\n>> >> THAT WAS THE 11 RADIO, DENNY HAMLIN\nTHE GAP 2.7 SECONDS BETWEEN HARVICK AND HAMLIN\n>> HOW MUCH OF IT IS JUST RHYTHM\nHOW MUCH IS IT NATURAL INSTIPGT? DO YOU UNDERSTAND AND TRY TO GET\nTHE TIMING RIGHT, CATCHING THEM OFF THE CORNER ON CORNER ENTRY\nNOT CATCHING THE MIDDLE CORNER >> HARVICK, YOU SEE HIM, HE'S\nCATCHING THE 78 TO HAD A LOT OF PROBLEMS\nHE'S THINKING WHAT DO I NEED TO DO WITH THE 78\nHE'S BEEN WATCHING 78 AND 21 YOU DON'T GET TO THAT CAR AND\nTHEN DECIDE HOW TO PASS THEM YOU'VE BEEN PAYING ATTENTION FOR\nSEVERAL LAPS AS THEY GET CLOSER TO YOU\nRHYTHM MATTERS THIS IS A RHYTHM RACETRACK\nIT'S SO FAST IF YOU'RE RUNNING 15 AND A HALF\nSECOND LAPS AROUND A HALF MILE RACETRACK, YOU PUT A LOT OF\nOTHER CARS ON THE RACETRACK. THE RHYTHM YOU GET IN IS\nIMPORTANT. >> 18 CARS ON THE LEAD LAP\nHARVICK JUST 25 LAPS TO GO McMURRAY RUNNING SIXTH\nJIMMY JOHNSON 7th. CARL EDWARDS EIGHTH.\nLAGANO IN 10th LAGANO WON THE LAST TWO NIGHT\nRACES IN BRISTOL AND NOW BACK IN 10th FOR THIS\nYEAR'S >> KEVIN HARVICK, A CHAMPION IN\nTHE SPRINT CUP SERIES. 40-YEAR-OLD OUT OF CALIFORNIA.\nONLY ONE PREVIOUS BRISTOL WIN. >> THIS IS THE SECOND RACE AT\nBRISTOL WHERE THERE ARE NAMES WE DIDN'T EXPECT IN THE TOP\nWHETHER IT'S THE UNIQUE TRACK THAT IS NOT ALL ABOUT HORSE\nPOWER AND DOWN FORCE OR IT'S THE ACCIDENTS.\nYOU LOOK AT THE TOP TEN, WE SEE NAMES, GOOD RUNS\nBACK TO THE SPRING, UNIQUE NAMES IN THE TOP FIVE AND TOP TEN.\n>> TREVOR BAYNE WITH A STRONG FINISH EARLY IN THESPRING.\nJUST OUTSIDE THE TOP TEN >> AND THAT RUNNING 17th\nANOTHER GOOD RUN >> PARKER.\n>> HARVICK IS IN THE LEAD. HE'S WON HERE BEFORE\nHIS CREW CHIEF HAS NOT AND HE TOLD ME YESTERDAY BEFORE\nTHE RACE HE SAID, FOUR OUT OF FIVE TIMES I'VE BEEN HERE WITH\nKEVIN, I FELT LIKE WE COULD WIN. I THINK IT'S 90% OF THE RACES\nI'VE RUN HERE, I FINISHED IN THE TOP THREE.\nTHIS IS A HUGE RACE FOR ME PERSONALLY\nI WANT TO WIN THIS RACE, AND I WANT TO WIN IT WITH KEVIN\nHARVICK TONIGHT. >> ONE THING THAT HAS NEVER\nHAPPENED HERE IS STEWART-HAAS RACING HAS NEVER WON AT BRISTOL.\nTHAT COULD CHANGE IF HEAVEN HARVICK IS ABLE TO STAY OUT\nFRONT FOR THE NEXT 18 LAPS THINK ABOUT MOMENTUM\nALL WE'VE HEARD FOR THE LAST TWO MONTHS IS JOE GIBBS RACING WITH\nA LITTLE BIT OF PENSKE SPRINKLED IN\nSTEWART-HAAS WANTS TO CONTEND. THEY'VE BEEN WORKING HARD AS\nLIKE EVERY RACE TEAM, BUT NOTHING IS BETTER THAN SUCCESS\nTHAT'S THE ULTIMATE MOMENTUM IN RACING\n>> AND YOU AND I TALKED ABOUT IT THE OTHER DAY.\nWE WERE WORRIED ABOUT THIS FOUR CAR.\nWE WERE A LITTLE BIT WORRIED IT DIDN'T HAVE THE SPEED.\nTODAY HE'S SERVING NOTICE THAT THEY ARE A REAL THREAT TO WIN\nTHIS CHAMPIONSHIP. >> TRYING TO GET BY BRIAN SCOTT,\nA LAP DOWN CAR LOOKING TO GET PAST THE 23 OF\nDAVID RAGAN, ALSO LAPS DOWN. AND WITH 15 TO GO HARVICK IS\nWANTING TO SEE THIS FINISH UNDER GREEN.\nHE HAS A DECENT 2 SECOND LEAD. HE CAN PICK AND CHOOSE HIS\nMOMENTS CAREFULLY. HE DOESN'T WANT ANOTHER RESTART.\n>> AND I DON'T THINK HE'S THE ONLY ONE\nIF YOU THINK ABOUT AUSTIN DILLON AND JAMIE McMURRAY\nTHEY'RE IN A POSITION TO WIN UNLESS SOMETHING CRAZY HAPPENS\nTHEY DON'T WANT SOMETHING BAD TO HAPPEN\nTHEY HAVE THE POINTS THEY NEED THEY'RE WANTING NO CAUTION AND\nTO HAVE THIS THING IN. RICKY STENHOUSE JUNIOR IS HOPING\nFOR A CAUTION, SOMETHING TO HAPPEN THAT COULD BE MAGICAL ON\nA LATE RACE RESTART. >> PENSKE, AND JOE GIBBS RACING,\nTHEY HAVE BEEN DOMINATING HERE IN FORDS\nBUT HOW ABOUT CHEVROLET? THEY HAVE 43 WINS.\nTHE LAST ONE CAME IN 2014. THE LAST NIGHT RACE IN 2004, AND\nIT WAS DALE JUNIOR WHO WON AND AMAZE DPLIINGLY ENOUGH THE T\nRACE THAT STARTED THE DAY IS GOING TO END AS A NIGHT RACE\n>> WE RAN 37 LAST NIGHT. >> AS WE'RE CLOSING IN ON 7:35\nON THE EAST COAST, 10 LAPS TO GO IS ONCE AGAIN A NIGHT RACE\nDAVE >> SECOND GOOD ONE OF THE YEAR\nAT BRISTOL FOR A.J THE FIRST ONE WAS FOIL BID A\nLOOSE WHEEL.

GETS THE POWER DOWN.\nTRIES TO CLEAR THE 22. THE 22 HAS TO CONTEND IT\nHE HAS TO TRY TO TAKE THE MOMENTUM BACK TO THE OUTSIDE AND\nTHE 18 HAS TO TRY TO CLOSE THE DOOR\nIN MY MIND THAT'S PURELY A BRISTOL RACING INCIDENT.\nI THINK BOTH DRIVERS DOING WHAT THEY HAD TO DO TO WIN.\n>> UP THE TRACK THE 18 COMES 22 WAS THERE\nAND INTO THE WALL GOES THE 18 OF KYLE BUSCH\nA LOT OF DAMAGE TO THE RIGHT FRONT, THOUGH, OF THE 22\nAND THE LEFT FRONT >> YOU SEE THIS OVERHEAD\n18 HAS A BIG RUN. >> 22 WAS NOT THERE BY MUCH.\n>> IF YOU'RE A KYLE BUSCH FAN, YOU SAY IT WAS THE 18.\nIT WAS NOT KYLE BUSCH'S FAULT.

I COMMITTED TO MY LINE AND\nFIGURED HE COULD HOLD ONTO IT. WHEN HE HIT THE WALL I COULDN'T\nGET CHECKED UP GOING SO FAST.\nWE'VE BEEN SO CLOSE THIS YEAR. I SAID HELL WITH IT.\nWE'RE GOING TO SEND IT TONIGHT AND TRY TO WIN THE RACE.\nWE CAME CLOSE.

PRETTY OBVIOUS\n>> STARTING UP FRONT WILL THAT DAMAGE AFFECT THE 22\nFOR THREE LAPS. >> DEFINITELY NOT MAKING THE 22\nBETTER IT WILL HURT THE CAR\nBUT WITH THE LEAD, WITH THE ABILITY TO PACE INTO THE\nRESTART. LOOKS LIKE THE RIGHT FRONT HAS A\nPOTENTIAL RUB. AT THIS POINT YOU HAVE TO STICK\nWITH IT AND HOPE IT CLEARS COMES DOWN TO THE RESTART ZONE\nIN MY MIND IF HE TIMES IT WELL, APPLIES THE\nPOWER, GETS THE REAR TIRES TO STICK.\nHE'S CONSISTENTLY HAD GOOD RESTARTS\nIF HE HAS EITHER LANE TO HIMSELF ENTERING TURN ONE, I BELIEVE HE\nCAN HOLD OFF THE FIELD FOR A LAP OR TWO\nYOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL LARSON WILL BE STARTING ON THE\nINSIDE IF BRAD DOESN'T GET A GREAT\nRESTART THE 42 WILL HAVE A LOT OF MOMENTUM.\nHE HASN'T GOTTEN OFF THE INSIDE VERY WELL TONIGHT.\nJUSTIN ALLGAIER IS IN FOURTH A LAP DOWN EARLIER\nRECOVERED. >> ELLIOTT SADLER.\nSEEMS LIKE THESE TWO RACE EACH OTHER EVERY WEEK\nTHEY'RE ALWAYS RACING AT THE END FOR POSITION\nMY CONCERN IN THE 22 AND KESELOWSKI IS THE RIGHT FRONT\nDAMAGE THAT LOOKS PRETTY SEVERE\nIF YOU LOOK AT THE TIRE, ALL THE I WHITE IS GONE.\nYOU SEE HOW HARD THE FENDER IS HIT.\nI'M WORRIED ABOUT DAMAGE, THE TOE BEING KNOCKED OFF.\nTHAT'S PRETTY HARD IMPACT. I WORRY, WHEN HE DRIVES INTO\nTURN ONE AFTER GETTING A GOOD RESTART WHICH I THINK HE'LL GET,\nWILL THE CAR TURN AND DO WHAT HE WANTS TO DO.\nYOU HAVE TO TRUST IT, RIGHT? YOU HAVE TO DRIVE IT THERE LIKE\nIT'S GOING TO STICK BUT I'M NOT SO SURE IT WILL.\n>> THIS IS NOT THE FIRST MESS-UP BETWEEN THE 22 AND THE 18 ON THE\nTRACK.

AT LAP 195 THEY RAN OUT OF FUEL,\nLOST FUEL PRESSURE AND HAD TO BE PUSHED BACK DOWN PIT ROAD.\n>> WE'LL GO INTO OVERTIME. THAT MEANS THAT WE WILL TAKE AS\nMANY ATTEMPTS AS WE CAN TO GET A CLEAN RESTART.\nONCE THE DRIVERS TAKE THE GREEN THEY'LL TRY TO MAKE IT AROUND TO\nTHE OVERTIME LINE ON THE BACK STRETCH.\nIF THEY GET TO THE OVERTIME, IF THE RACE LEADER GETS TO THE\nOVERTIME LINE BEFORE A FLAG COMES OUT, THEN THEY WILL BE\nABLE TO RACE TO THE CHECKERED FLAG\nIF A CAUTION COMES OUT AFTER THAT, THE FIELD IS FROZEN.\nTHEY WILL GO TO VIDEO AND DETERMINE WHO THE RACE WINNER\nWILL BE.

THE TEAMS THAT ARE RUNNING OUT\nOF FUEL MUST HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO PUT FUEL IN THE LAST TIME THEY\nWERE ON PIT ROAD BECAUSE THEY COULD EASILY GO 105 LAPS\nTHAT'S WHAT THE CREW CHIEFS DO YOU CHOOSE TO NOT PUT FUEL IN\nBECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE A FASTER PIT STOP BY USING THE FUEL MAN\nTO FULL THE FRONT TIRES.

WITH ALL THE CHANGES MADE TO THE\nRACETRACK, WHAT DOES THE WEATHER DO TO THAT\n>> THE CREW CHIEFS HAD A LOT TO WORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT WITH\nTHEIR PIT CREWS, WHETHER THEY WOULD STAY, TRAVEL BACK TO\nCHARLOTTE, COME BACK THIS MORNING.\nTHAT'S BEEN TAKEN CARE OF. NOW IT'S WHAT'S AHEAD.\nLIKE JEFF MENTIONED, THERE IS MORE RAIN IN THE AREA.\nWHEN IS THIS RACE GOING TO START?\nA DAY RACE, A NIGHT RACE A UNIQUE SITUATION WHERE THEY\nHAVE LAPS ON THE RACETRACK MAYBE THEY CAN DEBRIEF WITH\nTHEIR DRIVERS AND SEE HOW THAT CAR DROVE FOR THE SMALL PERIOD\nOF TIME WE WERE ON THE RACETRACK LAST NIGHT AND PLAN THE\nADJUSTMENTS FOR TODAY. >> LAST NIGHT 38 LAPS COMPLETE,\nTHEY TRIED AGAIN TO GO BACK OUT FOR TEN LAPS\nIN THAT BRIEF PERIOD OF TIME WE SAW DIFFERENT LINES, DIFFERENT\nGROOVES WORKING. WHAT WILL THE RAIN DO AND HOW\nWILL IT AFFECT THAT LOW GROOVE THAT WE THOUGHT MIGHT WORK FOR\nTHIS RACE? >> I HAVE NO IDEA.\nI MEAN, THAT'S THE GENERAL ANSWER IN THE GARAGE TOO\nYOU THINK IT'S REALLY INTERESTING LAST NIGHT, CARL\nEDWARDS TOOK THE BOTTOM LANE HE WAS THE POLE SITTER AND TOOK\nTHE BOTTOM LANE AND THAT DIDN'T WORK\nIT WAS AFTER THE RAIN, AFTER THE FACT THEY PUT THE MATERIAL ON\nTHE RACETRACK AND IT RAINED ON IT\nTOOK A LITTLE WHILE FOR THAT BOTTOM GROOVE TO COME IN\nI WOULD THINK THAT WOULD BE THE SAME THING THAT WOULD HAPPEN\nTHE QUESTION IS HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE AND HOW LONG WILL IT LAST\n WE SAW CARS ALREADY MAKING TIME ON THE BOTTOM AS WELL AS ON THE\nTOP.

THERE'S NOT A GARAGE HERE SO\nCARS HAVE BEEN PARKED OUTSIDE. WHEN THE RACE WAS CALLED LAST\nNIGHT IT ABSOLUTELY POURED ON THESE CARS WHILE THEY WERE ON\nTHE TRACK. >> I THINK THAT'S THE BIG\nCONCERN FOR THESE CREW CHIEFS. YOU MENTIONED THERE ARE NO\nGARAGES. IT WASN'T JUST THAT.\nWE SEE HERE WHEN THE RACE WAS FINALLY RED FLAGGED FOR FINAL\nTIME, HEAVY, HEAVY DOWNPOURS YOU LOOK AT THESE -- THE CARS\nDRIVING THROUGH THE RAIN THE WATER COMING THROUGH THE\nRIGHT SIDE AND THE LEFT SIDE WINDOW\nTHESE CREW CHIEFS HAVE TO DECIDE, YOU KNOW, WHAT DID GET\nWET, WHAT DIDN'T ARE WE WORRIED ABOUT THE RADIOS,\nTHE ELECTRONICS, DID IT GET IN A CLEANERAREA.\nTHEY'RE CONCERNED BECAUSE WE ARE A FEW LAPS IN THE RACE\nON TOP OF THAT, WE COVER THE CARS UP AND THEY SIT ALL NIGHT\nLONG ON PIT ROAD >> THAT'S THE BIGGEST CONCERN,\nWHAT GOT DAMAGED THAT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT\nTYPICALLY IT'S RADIO ISSUES. BUT YOU NEVER KNOW\nTHEN WHAT ABOUT TIRES? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO\nARE YOU GOING TO PIT, STAY OUT THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION TOO WHEN\nWE GO BACK GREEN >> TIRES HAVE BEEN SITTING OUT\nHERE IN THE RAIN ALL NIGHT ABOUT 12 HOURS ALREADY\nWE DID GET SOME RACING IN LAST NIGHT, ABOUT 38 LAPS, 31\nGREEN-FLAG LAPS, AND ANOTHER 17 THAT WERE UNDER CAUTION.\nLET'S TAKE ALOOK BACK AT SOME OF THAT ACTION ACTION THAT TOOK\nPLACE.

THE OUTSIDE WORKED WELL BUT YOU\nSEE THE 24, CHASE ELLIOTT, HE MADE THE MOVE FOR THE PASS,\nIMMEDIATELY GOT LOOSE ON CORNER EXIT\nHERE COMES KYLE BUSCH.

THE FIVE-TIME WORLD CHAMPIONS\nARE FINALLY OLYMPIC CHAMPIONS, TOO.\nTHEY DID IT AT HOME IN THEIR ICONIC STADIUM.\nTHE GAMES ARE DRAWING TO A CLOSE AND THE BIGGEST CHEER HAS BEEN\nRESERVED FOR THE HOME TEAM. DON RIDDELL FROM RIO.\n>> LET'S GO TO AMANDA DAVIS LIVE FROM RIO de JANEIRO.\nLET'S TALK ABOUT BRAZIL BEATING GERMANY ON PENALTY KICKS.\nCERTAINLY REVENGE FROM THE WORLD CUP.\nI THINK DON DESCRIBED IT WELL. BACK THEN, IT WAS HUMILIATING,\nDEVASTATING AND EMBARRASSING. NOW, BRAZIL GOT THE UPPER HAND.\n>> Reporter: GEORGE, I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE HERE TWO YEARS AGO,\nONE OF THE MOST STUNNING, INCREDIBLE NIGHTS OF FOOTBALL I\nHAVE EVER BEEN PART OF. THEN I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE\nTHERE AGAIN LAST NIGHT. I HAVE SEEN FIRSTHAND HOW BOTH\nOF THESE GAMES HAVE AFFECTED THE PEOPLE HERE IN BRAZIL.\nDESPITE THE FACT THE BRAZIL COACH IN THE RUN UP TO THIS HAD\nBEEN TRYING TO PLAY DOWN THE TALK OF REVENGE, THERE IS NO\nDOUBT THAT FOR ALL THOSE 80,000 FANS PACKED IN LAST NIGHT, THE\nPEOPLE OF BRAZIL, THIS IS VERY MUCH HOW THEY SAW IT.\nTHE ATMOSPHERE WAS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE.\nYOU COULD NOT HAVE PACKED ANOTHER SINGLE PERSON INTO THAT\nSTADIUM. I HAVE NEVER E SEEN A MEDIA BOX\nAS PACKED AS THAT WAS. THE CHEERS FROM THE CROWDS.\nTHE ABSOLUTE NERVOUS SILENCE DURING THOSE PENALTY KICKS.\nTHE NAIL BITING GASPS. WHEN THEY STEPPED UP AND SAW THE\nPENALTY SAVE, YOU HAVE TO FEEL FOR HIM.\nTHERE WAS ONLY A HANDFUL OF GERMAN FANS.\nTHE SCRIPT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BETTER.\nTHE BONE WHO MISSED OUT FROM INJURY TWO YEARS AGO, HE WAS\nABLE TO STEP UP AS CAPTAIN OF BRAZIL, CONVERT THE PENALTY AND\nINCREDIBLE, INCREDIBLE SCENES OF CELEBRATION.\nTHIS WITH EVERYTHING BRAZIL ACHIEVED AT THE OLYMPIC GAMES,\nTHIS IS THE MEDAL THEY WANTED. THIS IS A RELIGION, ISN'T IT,\nFOOTBALL HERE IN BRAZIL. THE SIXTH GOLD MEDAL OF THE\nGAMES, BUT YOU SUSPECT A WHOLE LOT MORE SPECIAL THAN THE REST.\nIT'S NOT JUST REVENGE BUT FOR MANY PEOPLE, THIS IS SOMETHING\nPOSITIVE OUT OF BRAZIL HOSTING AN OLYMPICS THAT PERHAPS MANY\nDIDN'T WANT TO SEE HERE. GEORGE?\n>> WHAT A WONDERFUL THING FOR THE NATION HOSTING THE OLYMPICS\nTO HAVE THIS MOMENT, ESPECIALLY IN FOOTBALL.\nAMANDA, LET'S LOOK AHEAD TO THE FINAL DAY OF COMPETITION.\nWHAT ARE SOME OF THE BIG EVENTS TO LOOK FORWARD TO?\n>> Reporter: I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NEARLY OVER.\nDAY 16 HAS COME AROUND SO QUICKLY.\nSO MUCH HAS HAPPENED. WE ARE ON THE FINAL DAY OF\nCOMPETITION AS ITS TRADITIONAL, WE HAVE THE MEN'S MARATHON, ONE\nOF THE FINAL EVENTS OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES.\nBRAZIL HOPING FOR ANOTHER GOLD MEDAL THERE.\nMEN'S VOLLEYBALL ARE TAKING ON AN ITALIANS.\nA REPEAT OF THE BEACH VOLLEYBALL WHICH BRAZIL WON GOLD IN.\nTHEY ARE HOPING TO REPEAT THE SUCCESS THERE.\nPERHAPS THE EVENT WITH THE BIGGEST NAMES OF TODAY IS THE\nMEN'S BASKETBALL FINAL. TEAM USA LOOKING TO EXTEND THEIR\nUNBEATEN RUN. THEY HAVEN'T BEEN AS DOMINANT AS\nWE HAVE SEEN SOME U.S. BASKETBALL TEAMS AT THE OLYMPIC\nGAMES IN THE PAST. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY FOR\nTHUMB, UP AGAINST THE SERBIANS WHO RAN THEM AWAY WHEN THEY MET\nIN THE GROUP STAGES. CERTAINLY, CERTAINLY HIGH HOPES\nFOR TEAM USA IN REPEATING THAT SUCCESS.\nTHEN, OF COURSE, WE HAVE THE CLOSING CEREMONY, THE CLIMAX OF\nWHAT HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE THREE WEEKS HERE, GEORGE.\nSO MANY SECRETS AROUND THE CLOSING CEREMONY.\nWE KNOW THAT IT'S GOING TO BE A CELEBRATION OF WHAT'S BEST IN\nBRAZIL. THAT'S HOW IT IS BEING SOLD.\nWE KNOW THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF SAMBA DANCING.\nA JOURNEY THROUGH GENERATIONS. LOTS OF VOLUNTEERS AND DANCERS.\nAGAIN, THE QUESTION THAT WE STARTED THE OLYMPICS WITH, WILL\nTHEY BE INVOLVED? THERE WAS A SUGGESTION WE MIGHT\nSEE HIM HERE. AGAIN, WE JUST DON'T KNOW.\n>> REALLY HAS BEEN GREAT GETTING THE COVERAGE FROM YOU, FROM\nCHRISTINA, YOU FEEL THE ENERGY AND EXCITEMENT FROM YOU GUYS\nGETTING TO WITNESS HISTORY FIRSTHAND.\nAMANDA DAVIS, THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.\nWE'LL BE IN TOUCH ON THIS FINAL",

LOGISTICALLY, WHAT IS THE\nGREATEST NEED RIGHT NOW FOR PEOPLE?\n. PEOPLE NEED RIGHT NOW IS TO\nFINISH CLEANING THEIR HOMES AND TO GET A FAIR ASSESSMENT FROM\nFEMA ON THE AMOUNT OF MONEY FEMA WILL ALLOW THEM.\nYOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE NOT A PART OF THE FEDERAL FLOOD INSURANCE\nPROGRAM, FEMA WILL ALLOW YOU $33,000, BUT THE AVERAGE THAT\nTHEY LOAN OUT IS ABOUT $7,000.

AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF WATER.\nYOU HAVE CLOSE TO SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT\nWERE AFFECTED, PEOPLE THAT HAD TO GO TO SHELTERS.\nIT'S GOING TO TAKE MONTHS FOR THIS TO BE REHABILITATED.\nYOU KNOW, THE HOMES ARE STANDING.\nIT'S NOT LIKE A HURRICANE WHERE THINGS GET BLOWN DOWN.\nTHERECEDES AND THE CARPET IS DESTROYED, THE FURNITURE IS\nDESTROYED. MOLD IS GROWING ON THE WALLS.\nYOU HAVE TO TAKE THE DRY ALL OFF, EXPOSE THE STUDS, LET THEM\nAIR OUT AND THEN COME BACK AND PUT A CHLORINE BLEACH SOLUTION\nON THE WALLS AND LET IT DRY AGAIN BEFORE YOU CAN BEGIN TO\nREBUILD.

I WILL BE IN MAINE, AUGUSTA,\nMAINE, THIS WEEK ON TUESDAY. THEN IN MONTPELIER, VERMONT ON\nWEDNESDAY, AND IN THURSDAY WE'LL BE IN ALBANY, NEW YORK.\nTHE ONLY HOPE FOR THIS COUNTRY IS GOD.\nI BELIEVE THE ONLY WAY WE CAN GET THERE IS IF AMERICA REPENTS\nFROM ITS SIN AND PUTS ITS FAITH AND TRUST IN JESUS CHRIST.\nAS A MINISTER OF THE GOSPEL, I WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW THE ONLY\nHOPE, THE ONLY WAY TO GOD IS THROUGH FAITH IN HIS SON JESUS\nCHRIST AND WE HAVE TO REPENT FROM SINS.\nTHIS NATION HAS SINNED GREATLY.

AND I'M TRYING TO GET THEM TO\nWAKE UP AND UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF GETTING OUT AND\nVOTING. WE TALK ABOUT THE PRESIDENTIAL\nELECTIONS BUT HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR THE MAYORS, THE CITY\nCOUNCIL, YOUR COUNTY COMMISSIONERS, YOUR SCHOOL\nBOARDS. I HOPE WE CAN GO ACROSS THE\nCOUNTRY AND GET THE SCHOOL BOARDS, TAKE THE SCHOOL BOARDS\nBACK AND LET'S HAVE MEN AND WOMEN OF GOD WHO BELIEVE THE\nBIBLE, WHO BELIEVE IN GOD RUNNING OUR SCHOOL SYSTEMS IN\nTHIS COUNTRY.

AND YOU WILL PROBABLY BE RIGHT.\nIN 2014, ABOUT 30,000 PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN TERROR ATTACKS\nWORLDWIDE. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE\nPERPETRATING THE VIOLENCE WERE MUSLIM.\nBUT -- AND THIS IS IMPORTANT -- SO WERE THE VICTIMS.\nOF THE 30,000 DEAD, THE VAST, VAST MAJORITY WERE MUSLIMS.\nTHAT'S CRUCIAL TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE IT SHEDS LIGHT ON THE\nQUESTION, \"WHY DO THEY HATE US?\" ISLAMIC TERRORISTS DON'T JUST\nHATE AMERICA OR THE WEST. THEY HATE THE MODERN WORLD AND\nTHEY PARTICULARLY HATE MUSLIMS WHO ARE TRYING TO LIVE IN THE\nMODERN WORLD. LET'S BE CLEAR, WHY THE JIHADIS\nARE FEW, THERE'S A LARGER CANCER WITHIN THE WORLD OF ISLAM, A\nCANCER OF BACKWARDNESS AND EXTREMISM AND INTOLERANCE.\nMOST OF THE COUNTRIES THAT HAVE LAWS THAT RESTRICT THE FREE\nEXERCISE OF RELIGION ARE MUSLIM MAJORITY.\nALL THAT HAVE LAWS AGAINST LEAVING THE FAITH ARE MUSLIM\nMAJORITY. BUT ARE THESE THINGS INHERENT IN\nTHE RELIGION? WHEN EXPERTS TRIED TO EXPLAIN IN\nTHE 14th CENTURY ISLAMIC CIVILIZATION WAS THE WORLD'S\nMOST ADVANCED OR THAT THE KORAN WAS ONCE READ AS A LIBERAL AND\nPROGRESSIVE DOCUMENT, THEY ARE NOT TRYING TO DENY THE REALITIES\nOF BACKWARDNESS TODAY. WHAT THEY ARE SAYING IS IT CAN\nCHANGE. ISLAM, AFTER ALL, HAS BEEN\nAROUND FOR 14 CENTURIES. THERE HAVE BEEN PERIODS OF WAR\nBUT ALSO OF PEACE. IT'S THE SAME RELIGION THEN AND\nNOW. SO WHAT IS DIFFERENT?\nIT'S NOT THEOLOGY. IT'S POLITICS.\nRADICAL ISLAM IS THE PRODUCT OF THE BROKEN POLITICS AND STAGNANT\nECONOMICS OF MUSLIM COUNTRIES. THEY HAVE FOUND IN RADICAL\nRELIGION AN IDEOLOGY THAT LETS THEM RAIL AGAINST THE MODERN\nWORLD, AN IDEOLOGY THAT IS NOW BEING EXPORTED TO ALIENATED\nYOUNG MUSLIMS EVERYWHERE, IN EUROPE, EVEN IN SOME RARE CASES,\nIN THE UNITED STATES. SO HOW TO END THIS?\nTHERE'S REALLY ONLY ONE WAY. HELP THE MAJORITY OF MUSLIMS\nFIGHT EXTREMISTS, REFORM THEIR FAITH, AND MODERNIZE THEIR\nSOCIETIES. IN DOING SO, WE SHOULD LISTEN TO\nTHOSE ON THE FRONT LINES. MANY OF WHOM ARE FIGHTING AND\nDYING IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST JIHADIS, THE HUNDREDS OF MUSLIM\nREFORMERS THAT I'VE SPOKEN TO SAID THEIR TASK IS MADE MUCH\nHARDER WHEN WESTERN POLITICIANS AND PUNDITS CONDEMN ISLAM\nENTIRELY, DEMEAN THEIR FAITH, AND SPEAK OF ALL MUSLIMS AS\nBACKWARD AND SUSPECT. HERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO THINK\nABOUT THIS. IN AMERICA, AFRICAN-AMERICANS\nMAKE UP ABOUT 13% OF THE POPULATION YET THEY COMPRISE\nABOUT 50% OF HOMICIDE OFFENDERS, ACCORDING TO A JUSTICE\nDEPARTMENT STUDY. NOW, WE UNDERSTAND, I HOPE WE\nUNDERSTAND, THAT WHEN WE SEE A BLACK MAN ON THE STREET, WE\nCANNOT, MUST NOT TREAT HIM AS A LIKELY CRIMINAL.\nIT WOULD BE DEHUMANIZING, UNFAIR AND RACIST.\nIN AMERICA OF ALL PLACES, PEOPLE SHOULD BE TREATED AS INDIVIDUALS\nAND NOT AS STEREOTYPES FROM A RACIAL, ETHNIC OR RELIGIOUS\nGROUP. REMEMBER, THE BANGLADESHI CAB\nDRIVER WHO DRIVES YOU TO THE AIRPORT HAS NOTHING, NOTHING TO\nDO WITH ISIS EVEN THOUGH HE IS A MUSLIM.\nIT'S HARD NOT TO MAKE THESE QUICK ASSOCIATIONS, ESPECIALLY\nIN THE WAKE OF A TERROR ATTACK. BUT IF AMERICA IS ABOUT\nANYTHING, IT IS THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE JUDGED AS\nINDIVIDUALS WITH INDIVIDUAL LIBERTIES AND RIGHTS.\nIT IS WHAT THEY HATE ABOUT US. WE MIGHT AS WELL LIVE UP TO OUR\nOWN IDEALS. I'M FAREED ZAKARIA.\nTHANK YOU FOR WATCHING.",

OF THE 30,000 DEAD, THE VAST,\nVAST MAJORITY WERE MUSLIMS, THAT'S CRUCIAL TO UNDERSTAND,\nBECAUSE IT SHEDS LIGHT ON THE QUESTION, WHY DO THEY HATE US?\nISLAMIC TERRORISTS DON'T JUST HATE AMERICA OR THE WEST, THEY\nHATE THE MODERN WORLD, AND THEY PARTICULARLY HATE TRYING TO LIVE\nIN THE MODERN WORLD. LET'S BE CLEAR.\nWHILE THE JIHADIS ARE FEW, THERE IS A LARGER CANCER WITHIN THE\nWORLD OF ISLAM, A CANCER OF EXTREMISM AND INTOLERANCE, MOST\nHAVE LAWS THAT RESTRICT THE FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION OR THE\nMAJORITY. ARE THESE THINGS INHERENT IN THE\nRELIGION? WHEN EXPERTS TRY TO EXPLAIN THAT\nIN THE 14th CENTURY ISLAMIC COUNTY -- THEY'RE NOT TRYING TO\nDENY THE REALTIES OF BACKWARDNESS TODAY, WHAT THEY'RE\nSAYING IS IT CAN CHANGE. ISLAM AFTER ALL HAS BEEN AROUND\nFOR 14 CENTURIES, THERE HAVE BEEN PERIODS OF WAR, BUT ALSO OF\nPEACE. IT'S THE SAME RELIGION THEN AND\nNOW, SO WHAT IS DIFFERENT? IT'S NOT THEOLOGY, IT'S\nPOLITICS. RADICAL ISLAM IS THE PRODUCT OF\nTHE BROKEN POLITICS AND STAGNANT ECONOMICS OF MUSLIM COUNTRIES.\nTHEY HAVE FOUND IN RADICAL RELIGIOUS AN IDEOLOGY THAT LETS\nTHEM RAIL AGAINST THE MODERN WORLD, AN IDEOLOGY THAT'S NOW\nBEING EXPORTED TO ALIENATED YOUNG MUSLIMS EVERYWHERE, IN\nEUROPE, EVEN IN SOME RARE CASES IN THE UNITED STATES.\nSO HOW TO END THIS?

HERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO THINK\nABOUT THIS, IN AMERICA, AFRICAN-AMERICANS MAKE UP ABOUT\n13% OF THE POPULATION, YET THEY COMPRISE ABOUT 50% OF HOMICIDE\nOFFENDERS, ACCORDING TO A JUSTICE DEPARTMENT STUDY.\nNOW WE UNDERSTAND, I HOPE WE UNDERSTAND, THAT WHEN WE SEE A\nBLACK MAN ON THE STREET, WE CANNOT, MUST NOT TREAT HIM AS A\nLIKELY CRIMINAL, IT WOULD BE DEHUMANIZING, UNFAIR, AND\nRACIST. IN AMERICA OF ALL PLACES, PEOPLE\nSHOULD BE TREATED AS INDIVIDUALS AND NOT AS STEREOTYPES FROM A\nRACIAL, ETHNIC OR RELIGIOUS GROUP.\nREMEMBER, THE BANGLADESHI CAB DRIVER WHO DRIVES YOU TO THE\nAIRPORT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ISIS, EVEN THOUGH IT IS ALSO A\nMUSLIM. IT'S HARD NOT TO MAKE THESE\nQUICK ASSOCIATIONS, ESPECIALLY IN THE WAKE OF A TERROR ATTACK.\nBUT IF AMERICA IS ABOUT ANYTHING, IT IS THE IDEA THAT\nPEOPLE SHOULD BE JUDGED WITH INDIVIDUALS WITH INDIVIDUAL\nLIBERTIES AND RIGHTS, IT IS WHAT THEY HATE ABOUT US.\nWE MIGHT AS WELL LIVE UP TO OUR OWN IDEALS.\nI'M FAREED ZAKARIA, THANK YOU",

BUT IT WAS MINUTE-BY-MINUTE AND\nKELLY AN THE NEW CAMPAIGN MANAGER CONFIRMS THAT HE WAS\nASKED TO LEAVE. IT IS NOT THAT THESE CANNOT BE\nMUTALLY, OR ARE MUTALLY EXCLUSIVE THAT BOTH SIDES COULD\nAGREE MUTALLY TO LEAVE BUT THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT HAPPENED\nWHEN YOU HAVE, REALLY, COMPETING INTERESTS TRYING TO SPIN THE\nNARRATIVE. CLEARLY MANAFORT WANTED TO\nPRESERVE HIS DIGNITY ON THE WAY OUT THE DOOR AND TRUMP DID NOT\nWANT THIS TO BE VIEWED AS A HEMORRHAGING.\n>> YOU CAN IMAGINE THE REPORTERS SCRAMBLING TO REACH MORE SOURCES\nON PAUL MANAFORT AND GET SOMETHING CLOSE TO THE TRUE.\nAMY IT SEEMS WHEN THE SHAKEUP HAPPENED, IT WAS A BOMBSHELL OF\nA STORY FOR THE CAMPAIGN THE PUNDITS REACTED BY BEING\nDISDAINFUL SAY IT DOES NOT MATTER BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP IS\nTHE PROBLEM. WAS THAT DISMISSIVE?\n>> IT WAS. WE HAVE SEEN SINCE DONALD\nTRUMP'S HIRING KELLYANNE CONWAY HE HAS BEEN MAYING THE\nPRESIDENTIAL PIVOT AFTER FIRE THE GAY WHO SAID IT WOULD HAPPEN\nIT HAS HAPPENED UNDER HER BE THE NEW CAMPAIGN MANAGER.\nWE WILL SEE IN IT LASTS. DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN A VOLATILE\nCANDIDATE AND HE CITIZENS MEDIA SCRUTINY BUT HE CITIZENS CREDIT\nFOR MAKING THE INITIAL ATTEMPTS. >> MOSTLY, I WOULD SAY THE PRESS\nWAS PUZZLED BY THIS, LESLIE, OR NEGATIVE AND I KNOW YOU ARE NO\nTRUMP FAN BUT HOW MUCH OF THE COME WAS INFLUENCED BY THE\nINCREASINGLY HOSTILE TONE IN THE PRESS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND THE\nCANDIDACY? >> FRANKLY, WHEN DONALD TRUMP\nOPENED HIS MOUTH EVERYONE WOULD COVER IT BECAUSE HE IS GOOD FOR\nRATINGS AND THAT IS THE REALITY AND A REAL BOTTOM LINE.\nI DON'T THINK DONALD TRUMP HAD ANY DISSERVICE.\nWE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE SHAKEUPS OF ALL THE CAMPAIGNED AT LEAST\nCURRENTLY, AND THERE WAS AN ADDITIONAL ELEMENT.\nNOT HE WAS TAKING A DIVE IN THE POLLS AND MAKING YET ANOTHER\nCHANGE IN HIS CAMPAIGN STAFF BUT THAT THERE WAS ALSO THE\nCONNECTIONS WITH RUSSIA AND THE UKRAINE AND EVEN THE QUESTION OF\nLEGALITY. I HEARD SOME HISTORIANS SAY BACK\nIN THE DAY IT WOULD BE TREASON AND --.\n>> WE WILL COME BACK TO MANAFORT, BUT, HEIDI PRZBYLA WE\nPLAID AT THE TOMORROW A SPEECH FOR DONALD TRUMP SAY HE REGRETS\nSOME OF PAST COMMENTS. IT WOULD BE FAIR TO SAY MOST OF\nTHE PRESS REACTION, SKEPTICAL. WAS HE FED THE LINE?\n>> THIS WAS SKEPTICISM AND SOME BORDERS ON SNARK, ONE STORY SAY\nIT WAS NOT AN APOLOGY BECAUSE HE DID NOT SAY THE WORD \"SORRY.\"\nBUT THERE WAS LET EGYPT REASONS, MOSTLY, THIS IS JUST NOT IN\nCHARACTER FOR DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN ASKED ALONG\nTHE WAY AS HE MADES THE CONTROVERSIAL COMMENTS IF HE\nREGRETS THEM AND HE SAID \"NO,\" EACH TIME AND IT COINCIDES WITH\nKELLYANNE COMING IN KNOWING THAT SHE WANTED TO GIVE HIM, TO\nSOFTEN UP THE IMAGE A BIT SO YOU QUESTION WHETHER THAT IS COMING\nLEGITIMATELY FROM HIS HEART OR FROM HER, FROM A CAMPAIGN\nPERSPECTIVE, BUT HE DID SAY THE WORDS AND IT WAS A BIG DEAL.\n>> RIGHT. WELL, SHE SAID IN ONE OF THE\nINTERVIEWS THIS WEEK THAT DONALD TRUMP WENT OVER THE SPEECH WITH\nA PEN, IT WAS NOT HER WORDS AND OF COURSE SHE WOULD SAY THAT.\nWHAT ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE MEDIA, AMY, THE MEDIA WERE\nSTUNNED BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP NEVER APOLOGIZED FOR ANYTHING\nBUT HE WASN'T SPECIFIC ABOUT WHICH COMMENTS AND TO WHOM HE\nCOULD BE EXPRESSING REGRET. >> DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF HAS SAID\nIT IS PART OF HIS LIFE STRATEGY TO ALWAYS IT BACK AND ALWAYS\nRETALIATE AND NEVER LET A CHARGE GO UNANSWERED SO FOR HIM TO NOW\nBE OFFERING WHAT SEEMED TO BE AN APOLOGY, NEWSWORTHY AND NEWS\nMAKING, BUT FOR THE PRESS TO IMMEDIATELY DISMISS IT AND\nPSYCHO ANALYZE DONALD TRUMP I DON'T THINK THAT IS FAIR,\nEITHER, AND THE REPORT THIS WEEK WE RELEASED A POLL THAT FOUND\n52% OF LIKELY VOTE ARE THINK THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS THE\nBEST MEDIA COVERAGE SO FAR IN THE CAMPAIGN.\n>> THE RELATED QUESTION, THEN, WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH THE MINI\nPIVOTS BEFORE WHERE HE GIVES SCRIPTED SPEECHES AND EVERYONE\nSAID, HE IS MORE DISCIPLINED AND IT DOES NOT LAST.\nSO WAS THE SKEPTICISM JUSTIFIED? >> ABSOLUTELY.\n SAYS, YOU KNOW, JUST HISTORICALLY, YOU\nLOOK BACK, SOMEONE WHO SAYS I'M CONCERNED, IN I HAVE HURT\nANYONE, LIKE YOU SAID, THERE IS A NOTE, NO SPECIFIC APOLOGY AND\nNO SPECIFICS TO WHO HE OFFENDED OR WHAT HE FEEL REMORSEFUL OR\nREGRET ABOUT. THIS IS THE MAN THAT TALKED\nABOUT PUNCHING MICHAEL BLOOMBERG IN THE FACE, A MAN WHO CARED\nABOUT HIMSELF AFTER THE ORLANDO FACT AND FELT THAT A MAN WHOSE\nSON DIED FOR THE COUNTRY WAS ATTACKING HIM.\n>> AND EVERYONE THINKS THAT WAS A POLITICAL MISTAKE BUT HE WHAT\nDENOUNCED AT THE CONVENTION. NOW, BACK TO THIS QUESTION ON\nPAUL MANAFORT WOULD LASTED FOUR MONTHS OR SO AS THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN MANAGER. \"NEW YORK TIMES\", HEIDI PRZBYLA,\nDID THE FIRST OF SEVERAL PIECES ABOUT HIS TIES AS A GUY WHO HAS\nBEEN A LOBBYIST FOR YEARS TO UKRAINE AND HOW LEDGERS WERE\nDISCOVERED THAT SEEMED TO SHE $12 MILLION IN CASHIER MARKED\nFOR PAUL MANAFORT AND HE DENIED HE EVER RECEIVED THE MONEY AND\nDENOUNCED \"NEW YORK TIMES\" BUT WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE STORY?\nWAS THAT STORY FAIR? >> IT TOOK A GOOD READ OVER THAT\nAND HERE IS MY ASSESSMENT, A GOOD EXAMPLE WHERE THE NARRATIVE\nKIND OF MAKES THE STORY COMPARED TO THE SPECIFIC FACTS IN THE\nSTORE BECAUSE GOING INTO THIS, WE ALL KNOW THAT MANAFORT HAD\nTIES TO BIG RUSSIAN MONEY AND PARTICULARLY TO SOMEONE WHO IS\nCORRUPT AS THEY COME. GOING INTO THAT, WE HAD THE\nPREFORMED IMPRESSION AND WE LOOK AT THE FACT THEY ARE HANDWRITTEN\nLEDGERS, AN ASSERTION, BASICALLY AN ASSERTION FROM A UKRAINE\nAGENCY THAT WE ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH.\nMANAFORT COULD DENY IT. SO LOWER IN THE STORY THE\nINVESTIGATOR SAID THIS WAS IN PROOF HE RECEIVED THE MONEY AND\nIT WRITES US, WHY IS THIS NEWS? IT IS NEWS BECAUSE OF WHAT WE\nKNEW PREVIOUSLY THAT THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO\nMEN THAT IS TROUBLING BECAUSE OF WHO THIS MAN IS.\n>> A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE PRESS JUMP TO THE CONCLUSIONS IT WAS\nTHE STORIES OF THE RUSSIAN TIES AND THE UKRAINE RELATIONSHIP\nTHAT SUNK PAUL MANAFORT BUT I AM TOLD THAT DONALD TRUMP WHILE NOT\nHAPPY ABOUT THAT WAS MORE UPSET ABOUT LEAKY \"NEW YORK TIMES\"\nTEASE \"INSIDE THE FAILED MISSION TO TAME DONALD TRUMP\nORGANIZATION HIS ADVISORS SAYING HE IS NOT COACHABLE AND FRANCE\nHE FINDINGED THE FINGER PRINTS OF MANAFORT WERE ON THAT PIECE.\n>> I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IN THAT IS CASE BECAUSE DONALD\nTRUMP DOES NOT LIKE LEAKS THAT HE CANNOT BE TAMED.\nBACK TO THE RUSSIAN STORY, PART OF WHAT FUELED THE MEDIA\nCOVERAGE OF THAT IS IT DOVETAILED WITH THE VLADIMIR\nPUTIN AND DONALD TRUMP BROMANCE AND THE KIND WORDS THEY HAVE FOR\nEACH OTHER. YOU NOTICE BURIED WAY IN THE\nPRINT WAS THAT THE PODESTA GROUP, THEY, ALSO, ARE UNDER\nSCRUTINY AND LOOKING AT MAINSTREAM MEDIA YOU WOULD THINK\nIT WAS ONLY ABOUT PAUL MANAFORT. >> I WANT TO CLOSE THIS SEGMENT\nAND ASKING YOU, LESLIE, ABOUT THE VOLUME, THE GUSHER OF\nANTI-TRUMP STORY AND HEADLINES COMPARED TO HILLARY CLINTON AND\n\"POLITICO\" \"REGRETFUL DONALD TRUMP PIVOTS 107 DAYS LATER.\"\nOR \"NEW YORK TIMES\" $630 MILLION IN DEBT,\" AND WORRIES THAT THIS\nWILL LOWER ALL BOATS BUT ANOTHER, HILLARY CLINTON IS\nLAYING PLANS FOR THE WHITE HOUSE AGENDA AS IN THE RACE IS OVER.\n>> I SAID IT BEFORE IT IS NOT RIGHT FOR ANY OUTLET NOT\nREPORTING ALL OF THE FACTS AND THAT IS WHAT A TRUE JOURNALIST\nSHOULD DO. FRANKLY, DIRT ON DONALD,\nANYTHING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP IS MORE ATTRACTIVE TO READERS AND\nTO VIEWERS AND LISTENERS THAN INFORMATION ABOUT HILLARY\nCLINTON SO IN IT PLEADS, IT LEADS OR IN IT HAD DONALD'S NAME\nIT LEADS. >> WHICH UNBALANCED THE\nCOVERAGE. >> AND BEFORE BREAK, SUPPOSEDLY\nHE SAID HE WILL LOSE SO GOOD, AND THE PIECE SAID HIS SHAKEUP\nCOULD BE AN INTENTIONAL EFFORT TO TANK THE ELECTION IN\nSPECTACULAR FASHION, TALK ABOUT AN UNSUPPORTED PIECE OF\nSPECULATION.

AND OF COURSE HE DESERVES MEDIA\nSCRUTINY, BUT I THINK HE ALSO DESERVES CREDIT FOR AT LEAST\nMAKING THESE INITIAL ATTEMPTS. >> BUT MOSTLY I WOULD SAY THE\nPRESS WAS EITHER PUZZLED BY THIS, LESLIE MARSHALL, OR\nNEGATIVE TOWARD IT. I KNOW YOU'RE NO TRUMP FAN, BUT\nHOW MUCH OF THE COVERAGE DO YOU THINK WAS INFLUENCED BY THE\nINCREASINGLY HOSTILE TONE IN THE PRESS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND HIS\nCANDIDACY? >> WELL, I THINK QUITE FRANKLY\nANY TIME TRUMP OPENED HIS MOUTH, EVERYBODY WOULD COVER IT BECAUSE\nHE'S GOOD FOR RATINGS. I MEAN, THAT'S THE REALITY AND\nTHAT'S A REAL BOTTOM LINE. I DON'T THINK TRUMP HAD ANY\nDISSERVICE. WE HAVE TO LOOK HISTORICALLY,\nTHIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST SHAKEUP WE'VE SEEN IN A\nPRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, AT LEAST IN THE MOST CURRENT ELECTIONS IN\nMODERN DAY. AND I THINK THERE WAS ALSO -- I\nMEAN, THERE WAS ADDITIONAL ELEMENT.\nIT WASN'T JUST THAT HE WAS TAKING A NOSE DIVE IN THE POLLS\nAND MAKING YET ANOTHER CHANGE IN HIS CAMPAIGN STAFF.\nBUT THERE WAS ALSO THE CONNECTIONS WITH RUSSIA AND THE\nUKRAINE AND EVEN THE QUESTION OF LEGALITY.\nI HEARD SOME HISTORIANS SAY BACK IN THE DAY THIS WOULD BE TREASON\nAND SOMEBODY WOULD BE HUNG FOR THIS.\n>> WE'LL COME BACK TO THE MANAFORT QUESTION.\nLET ME GET HEIDI IN ON THIS QUESTION.\nWE PLAYED IT AT THE TOP TRUMP GIVING A SCRIPTED SPEECH IN\nWHICH HE SAYS HE REGRETS SOME OF HIS PAST COMMENTS.\nAND I THINK IT WOULD BE FAIR TO SAY MOST OF THE PRESS REACTION\nWAS SKEPTICAL, DID HE REALLY MEAN IT OR WAS HE BEING FED\nTHESE LINES? >> THERE WAS DEFINITELY SOME\nSKEPTICISM. AND SOME OF IT EVEN BORDERED ON\nSNARK. I SAW ONE STORY SAY, WELL, IT\nWASN'T REALLY AN APOLOGY BECAUSE HE DIDN'T SAY THE WORD SORRY.\nBUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE WAS SOME LEGITIMATE REASONS FOR\nSKEPTICISM HERE. MOST OF ALL THIS IS JUST NOT IN\nCHARACTER FOR TRUMP BECAUSE HE'S BEEN ASKED ALONG THE WAY AS HE'S\nMADE THESE CONTROVERSIAL COMMENTS IF HE REGRETS THEM.\nAND EACH TIME HE SAID NO. IT ALSO COINCIDES ALMOST\nPERFECTLY WITH KELLYANNE COMING IN AS HIS NEW CAMPAIGN MANAGER\nKNOWING THAT SHE WANTED TO GIVE HIM -- TO SOFTEN UP HIS IMAGE A\nBIT. SO YOU QUESTION WHETHER THAT'S\nCOMING LEGITIMATELY FROM HIS HEART OR FROM HER FROM A\nCAMPAIGN PERSPECTIVE. THAT SAID, YOU KNOW, HE DID SAY\nTHE WORDS AND IT WAS A PRETTY BIG DEAL.\n>> RIGHT. RIGHT.\nWELL, KELLYANNE CONWAY SAID IN ONE OF HER MANY INTERVIEWS THIS\nWEEK THAT DONALD TRUMP WENT OVER THE SPEECH WITH A PEN.\nIT WASN'T HER WORDS. OF COURSE SHE'S GOING TO SAY\nTHAT. AMY, WHAT ABOUT THE FACT THAT\nTHE MEDIA, LOOK, LET'S FACE IT, THE MEDIA WERE STUNNED BECAUSE\nTRUMP NEVER APOLOGIZES FOR ANYTHING, ALTHOUGH HE WASN'T\nSPECIFIC ABOUT WHICH COMMENTS AND TO WHOM HE MIGHT BE\nEXPRESSING REGRET. >> RIGHT.\nAND DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF HAS SAID IT'S A PART OF HIS SORT OF\nLIFE STRATEGY TO ALWAYS HIT BACK AND ALWAYS RETALIATE, NEVER LET\nA CHARGE GO UNANSWERED. SO FOR HIM TO NOW BE OFFERING\nWHAT SEEMED TO BE AN APOLOGY OF COURSE WAS NEWSWORTHY AND NEWS\nMAKING. BUT FOR THE PRESS TO IMMEDIATELY\nDISMISS IT AND PSYCHOANALYZE DONALD TRUMP, I DON'T THINK\nTHAT'S FAIR EITHER. AND AT RASMUSSEN REPORTS THIS\nWEEK, WE RELEASED A POLL THAT FOUND 52% OF LIKELY VOTERS THINK\nTHAT THE MEDIA THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS GOT THE BEST MEDIA\nCOVERAGE SO FAR IN THIS CAMPAIGN.\n>> THE RELATED QUESTION HERE IS WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THE SORT OF\nMINIPIVOTS BEFORE WHERE TRUMP GIVES A COUPLE SCRIPTED\nSPEECHES, NOW HE'S A MORE DISCIPLINED CANDIDATE AND IT\nDOESN'T LAST. SO IS SKEPTICISM ON THIS ROUND\nJUSTIFIED? >> I THINK IT IS ABSOLUTELY\nJUSTIFIED. WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO SAYS,\nYOU KNOW, JUST HISTORICALLY, WHEN YOU LOOK BACK SOMEBODY JUST\nSAYS I'M CONCERNED IF I'VE HURT ANYONE LIKE YOU HAD SAID, THERE\nIS ONE NOTE ACTUAL SPECIFIC APOLOGY, TWO, THERE ARE NO\nSPECIFICS TO WHO HE HAS OFFENDED AND WHAT HE FEELS REMORSEFUL,\nYOU KNOW, HAS REGRET ABOUT. AND, I MEAN, THIS IS THE MAN\nTHAT TALKED ABOUT PUNCHING MICHAEL BLOOMBERG IN THE FACE.\nTHIS IS A MAN WHO CARED ABOUT HIMSELF AFTER THE ORLANDO\nTERRORIST ATTACKS AND ALSO FELT THAT A MAN WHOSE SON DIED FOR\nTHIS COUNTRY WAS ATTACKING HIM. AND THEN ATTACKED THE MOTHER FOR\nTHE SILENCE. >> YOU CAN CERTAINLY CRITICIZE\nTRUMP'S RESPONSE. EVERYBODY THINKS IT WAS A\nPOLITICAL MISTAKE, BUT HE WAS DENOUNCED BY MR. KHAN AT THE\nCONVENTION. THE \"NEW YORK TIMES,\" HEIDI, DID\nTHIS BIG PIECE, IT WAS THE FIRST OF SEVERAL PIECES OF HIS TIES --\nTHE GUY'S BEEN A LOBBYIST FOR YEARS TO UKRAINE AND HOW LEDGERS\nWERE DISCOVERED THAT SEEMED TO SHOW $12 MILLION IN CASH BEING\nEARMARKED FOR PAUL MANAFORT. MANAFORT'S VEHEMENTLY DENIED HE\nEVER RECEIVED ANY OF THAT MONEY. HE DENOUNCED \"NEW YORK TIMES.\"\nWHAT'D YOU MAKE OF THAT STORY? DIDN'T PROVE HE GOT THE\nPAYMENTS. WAS THAT STORY FAIR?\n>> I TOOK A GOOD READ, HOWIE, AND THIS IS MY ASSESSMENT.\n. I THINK THIS IS AN EXAMPLE THE\nNARRATIVE MAKES THIS STORY VERSUS SPECIFIC FACTS IN THIS\nSTORY. GOING INTO THIS WE ALL KNOW THAT\nMANAFORT HAD TIES TO BIG RUSSIAN MONEY AND TO YANUKOYVICH, WHO IN\nPARTICULAR IS AS CORRUPT AS THEY COME.\nSO GOING INTO THAT WE HAD THE PREFORMED CONFESSION.\nLOOK AT THE FACTS. THESE ARE HANDWRITTEN LETTERS,\nIT'S AN ASSERTION FROM A UKRAINIAN AGENCY THAT WE'RE NOT\nFAMILIAR WITH. MANAFORT COULD EASILY DENY IT.\nSO, YOU KNOW, EVEN LOWER DOWN IN THE STORY THE INVESTIGATORS HAD\nSAID THERE WAS NO PROOF HE ACTUALLY RECEIVED THE MONEY.\nSO THAT KIND OF BRINGS US BACK TO WHY IS THIS NEWS?\nWELL, THIS IS NEWS BECAUSE OF WHAT WE KNEW PREVIOUSLY WHICH IS\nTHERE IS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO MEN THAT IS TROUBLING\nIN AND OF ITSELF BECAUSE WHO YANUKOYVICH IS.\n>> YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE PRESS JUMP TO THE\nCONCLUSION, AMY, THAT IT WAS THESE STORIES ABOUT THE RUSSIAN\nTIES AND THE UKRAINIAN RELATIONSHIP THAT SUNK PAUL\nMANAFORT. I'M TOLD BY MY SOURCES THAT\nDONALD TRUMP WHILE NOT HAPPY ABOUT THAT DISTRACTION WAS MUCH\nMORE UPSET WITH THE STORY WE TALKED ABOUT LAST SUNDAY WHICH\nWAS BIG LEAKY \"NEW YORK TIMES\" PIECE, HIS OWN ADVISOR SAYING\nDONALD TRUMP IS NOT COACHABLE AND PERHAPS CONCLUDED MANAFORT'S\nWERE FAIRLY ON THAT PIECE. >> WELL, I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED\nIF THAT WAS THE CASE THAT DONALD TRUMP DID NOT LIKE HAVING THESE\nLEAKS IN THE PRESS THAT HE CAN'T BE TAMED.\nBUT I THINK GETTING BACK TO THE RUSSIA STORY, PART OF ALSO WHAT\nFUELED THE MEDIA COVERAGE OF THAT IS THAT IT DOVETAILED WITH\nTHE VLADIMIR PUTIN/DONALD TRUMP STEAMY BROMANCE AND THE KIND\nWORDS THEY'VE HAD FOR EACH OTHER.\nBUT IF YOU LOOK AT THESE ARTICLES TOO, YOU NOTICE BURIED\nWAY DOWN IN THE PRINT WAS THAT THE PADESTA GROUP, HILLARY\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN MANAGER'S BROTHER, THEY'RE ALSO UNDER\nSCRUTINY. BUT LOOKING AT MSM, MAINSTREAM\nMEDIA, YOU WOULD THINK IT WAS ONLY ABOUT PAUL MANAFORT.\n>> RIGHT. I JUST WANT TO CLOSE THIS\nSEGMENT ASKING YOU, LESLIE, ABOUT JUST THE VOLUME, GUSHER OF\nANTI-TRUMP HEADLINES VERSUS THOSE INVOLVING HILLARY CLINTON.\nPIVOT 107 DAYS LATE. \"NEW YORK TIMES,\" IN TRUMP'S IN\nDEBT, GOP WORRIES ALL BODES. BUT TODAY ON THE FRONT PAGE,\nWITH A COMFORTABLE LEAD CLINTON BEGINS LAYING PLANS FOR HER\nWHITE HOUSE AGENDA, ALMOST AS IF THE RACE WAS OVER.\n>> I'VE SAID IT BEFORE, I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT THAT ANY OUTLET\nIS NOT REPORTING ALL THE FACTS. THAT'S WHAT A TRUE JOURNALISTIC\nSOURCE SHOULD DO. BUT AGAIN, QUITE FRANKLY, DIRT\nON DONALD, ANYTHING ABOUT DONALD JUST IS MORE ATTRACTIVE TO\nREADERS AND TO VIEWERS AND TO LISTENERS THAN INFORMATION ABOUT\nHILLARY CLINTON. AND SO IF IT BLEEDS, IT LEADS,\nOR IF IT HAS DONALD TRUMP'S NAME IN IT IT LEADS.\n>> TRUE. BEFORE WE GO TO BREAK, THE NEW\nYORK DAILY NEWS COVER SUPPOSEDLY TRUMP SAYING I'M GOING TO LOSE\nSO GOOD. THIS PIECE ACTUALLY SAYS THAT\nHIS SHAKEUP COULD BE AN INTENTIONAL EFFORT TO TANK THE\nELECTION IN SPECTACULAR FASHION. TALK ABOUT A COMPLETELY\nUNSUPPORTED PAR SPECULATION. YOU CAN WRITE TO US\nATMEDIABUZZ.COM. WHEN WE COME BACK, CLOSER LOOK\nAT THE CONTROVERSIAL BREITBART MEDIA OPERATION THAT PRODUCED\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN'S NEW CEO. AND LATER, THE PASSING OF JOHN\nMcWHO INFLUENCED NUCH OF WHAT YOU SEE TODAY ON CABLE NEWS.                  They feel good?      No...",

WE NEED HELP.\nTYPICALLY BY THIS POINT, RED CROSS WOULD BE RECEIVING A LOT\nMORE DONATIONS AND A LOT MORE VOLUNTEERS SIGNING UP.\nWE HAVE SOME OF THAT IN PLACE NOW.\nIT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF PEOPLE DONATED TO THE RED CROSS AND\nALSO TO COME IN AND VOLUNTEER TO HELP PEOPLE GET BACK IN THEIR\nHOMES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. >> YOU GET WHAT YOU NEED FROM\nTHE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT? >> YES, AND DANA, I SUBMITTED\nTHE FORMAL REQUEST FOR A NATIONAL DECLARATION AND THE\nPRESIDENT GRANTED THAT WITHIN A FEW HOURS AND CALLED ME.\nI WILL TELL YOU THAT THE COOPERATION WE HAVE HAD WITH OUR\nFEDERAL PARTNERS AT FEMA HAS BEEN EXTRAORDINARY THIS WEEK.\nI DON'T HAVE ANY COMPLAINTS AT ALL ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP I\nHAVE WITH FEMA AND THE ASSISTANCE THEY ARE PROVIDING OR\nTHE TIMELINESS OF THAT ASSISTANCE.\nWE HAVE TRANSITIONED FROM RESPONSE TO RECOVERY AND THIS IS\nGOING TO TAKE MANY MONTHS. >> SO DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE\nPENCE CAME TO BATON ROUGE AND YOU DISMISSED IT AS A PHOTO OP\nAND SAID YOU WISH TRUMP WOULD MAKE A DONATION INSTEAD.\nWE CHECKED WITH THE DONATION AND HE MADE A $100,000 DONATION AND\nHE MADE A DONATION TO THE GREEN WILL BAST ITCH CHURCH WHERE HE\nVISITED. HERE'S WHAT MARY LANDRIEU SAID\nABOUT THE VISIT. >> I WANT TO THANK MR. TRUMP FOR\nCOMING TO LOUISIANA. HE BROUGHT ATTENTION TO THE\nSTATE AND WE NEED THAT NOW. >> WHY IS SHE WRONG?\n>> SHE IS NOT. YOU MISCHARACTERIZED WHAT I\nSAID. I DIDN'T DISMISS HIS TRIP AS A\nPHOTO OP. I SAID WE WELCOME HIM AND HOPE\nHE IS HELPFUL AND IT DOESN'T TURN INTO A PHOTO OP.\nYOU GOT IT BACKWARDS. >> WAS HE HELPFUL AND WAS IT A\nGOOD THING THAT HE CAME DOWN? >> FOR THE REASONS I STATED\nEARLIER BECAUSE IT HELPED TO SHINE A SPOTLIGHT ON LOUISIANA\nAND THE DIRE SITUATION WE HAVE THAT IT WAS HELPFUL AND I\nAPPRECIATED THE GOOD PHONE CALL AND CONVERSATION THAT I HAD WITH\nGOVERNOR PENCE WHO WAS SINCERE AND GENUINE WHEN HE CALL AND WE\nSPOKE FOR A LONG TIME ABOUT THE DESIRE TO BE HELPFUL.\n>> FOLLOWING TRUMP'S VISIT, THE WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCED POP WILL\nTRAVEL THERE ON TUESDAY. THAT CAME AFTER A LOCAL PAPER,\nTHE ADVOCATE PUBLISHED AN EDITORIAL CALLING ON THE\nPRESIDENT TO CUT HIS VACATION SHORT AND YOU DEFENDED THE\nPRESIDENT SAYING YOU WOULD RATHER DELAY HIS VISIT TO\nPRESERVE RESOURCES. DID YOU ASK THE WHITE HOUSE NOT\nTO COME AND DID THEY WANT TO COME?\n>> I WOULD NEVER ASK THE WHITE HOUSE NOT TO DO WHAT THE\nPRESIDENT WANTS TO DO. >> DEAR THEY WANT TO COME DOWN\nEARLIER? >> THE WHITE HOUSE ASKED ME AND\nTHE PRESIDENT AND VALERIE JARRETT ASKED ME WHEN WOULD BE A\nGOOD TIME FOR A VISIT. I ASKED THEM TO LET US GET OUT\nOF RESPONSE MODE WHERE WE WERE STILL CONDUCTING SEARCHES OF\nHOUSES AND MAKING RESCUES. I DIDN'T WANT TO DIVERT THE\nPOLICE OFFICERS, SHERIFFS DEPUTIES AND STATE TROOPERS AND\nOTHER ESSENTIAL RESOURCES AND ASSETS TO PROVIDE SECURITY FOR\nTHE PRESIDENT AND UNDERTAKE THOSE RESPONSE ACTIVITIES.\nI ASKED IF HE COULD WAIT UNTIL THE RESPONSE IS OVER AND WE GOT\nINTO THE RECOVERY PHASE WHICH I PREDICTED WE WOULD DO-OVER THE\nWEEKEND AND NEXT TIME WOULD BE A BETTER TIME FOR US TO VISIT.\nTHE PRESIDENT IS WELCOME TO COME TO OUR STATE ANY TIME HE WANTS\nTO. >> RUDY GIULIANI RELEASED A\nSTATEMENT CRITICIZING YOU SAYING THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR'S\nCRITICISM OF MR. TRUMP'S VISIT IS AN OUTRAGE AND INCONSISTENT\nWITH THE CRITICISM OF PRESIDENT BUSH'S DECISION TO NOT GO TO NEW\nORLEANS IMMEDIATELY AFTER HURRICANE KATRINA.\nI WAS A WHITE HOUSE REPORTER BACK THEN AND WITH PRESIDENT\nBUSH WHEN HE VISITED FIVE DAYS AFTER KATRINA HIT AND A LOT OF\nFOLKS, ESPECIALLY DEMOCRATS COMPLAINED THAT IT WASN'T SOON\nENOUGH. IS THERE A DOUBLE STANDARD HERE?\n>> NO. I BELIEVE THAT MAYOR GIULIANI\nGOT IT WRONG PERHAPS FOR THE SAME REASON YOU DID.\nI HAVE NOT BEEN CRITICAL OF MR. TRUMP'S VISIT.\nI TRIED NOT TO COMMENT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO GET TIED UP IN THE\nPOLITICS OF WHETHER IT'S THE PRESIDENT OR HILLARY CLINTON OR\nDONALD TRUMP. I TRIED NOT TO COMMENT AND THE\nCOMMENTS I HAVE MADE HAVE BEEN RESERVED.\nI THINK HE WAS OFF BASE WITH THAT COMMENT.\nAS FOR WHEN THE PRESIDENT VISITS, I THINK I JUST WENT OVER\nTHAT. HE IS WELCOME TO VISIT WHEN HE\nWANTS TO, BUT BECAUSE WE WERE UNDERGOING THE RESPONSE IN THE\nCAPITAL REGION, I ASKED THAT THEY CONSIDER NEXT WEEK WHEN\nWHICH IS WHAT HE IS GOING TO DO. >> YOU HAVE A LOT OF IMPORTANT\nWORK TO DO AND I DON'T WANT TO KEEP YOU LONGER.\nI WANT TO REITERATE TO PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN DONATE TO THE RED\nCROSS AND MORE INFORMATION ON HOW TO HELP VOLUNTEER OR WHERE\nTO DONATE. GO TO CNN.COM/IMPACT.\nGOOD LUCK TO YOU. >> THANK YOU, DANA.\n>> 79 DAYS TO GO UNTIL THE ELECTION.\nIS IS THE WILDEST STRETCH STILL TO COME?\nA TOP ADVISER AND WHAT THEY HAVE IN STORE FOR HILLARY CLINTON IN\nSEPTEMBER.

IT READS IN PART THE OPTICS OF\nOBAMA GOLFING WHILE LOUISIANA RESIDENTS LANGUISHED IN\nFLOODWATERS WAS STRIKING. IT EVOKED THE PRESIDENT OF THE\nPASSIVE FEDERAL RESPONSE TO THE STATE'S AGONY IN 2005, A CHAPTER\nOF HISTORY NO ONE SHOULD EVER REPEAT.\nNOW THAT REFERENCE TO 2005 OF COURSE A REFERENCE TO HURRICANE\nKATRINA.

YOU HAD ONE POLITICAL PARTY AND\nTHE OTHER. AND THEY WEREN'T GETTING ALONG.\nTHERE WAS A LACK OF PATRIOTISM. 52% OF AMERICANS TODAY ARE\nEXTREMELY PROUD TO BE AMERICANS. THAT'S PROBABLY WHERE THEY WERE\n202 YEARS AGO.

WHAT DID YOU LEARN AT THAT TIME\nAND WHY IS THAT RELEVANT TODAY AND WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM IT?\n>> I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE NEWSPAPERS\nBACK THEN, THEY WERE EITHER PRO ONE PARTY OR PRO ANOTHER.\nTHEY DIDN'T HIDE IT. THEY WERE VERY CLEAR THAT THEY\nAFFILIATED. AND THERE WAS ONE NEWSPAPER IN\nWASHINGTON THAT WAS SO PRO PRESIDENT JAMES MADISON THAT THE\nBRITISH THOUGHT IT WAS A GOVERNMENT-RUN PAPER.\nTHEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF OUR FREEDOM OF SPEECH\nIN AMERICA. AND HE ATTACKED THAT PARTICULAR\nNEWSPAPER BUILDING BECAUSE OF THAT MEDIA BIAS.\nSO WE TODAY HAVE MEDIA BIAS, BUT WE ALSO HAVE A LOT OF\nOBJECTIVITY THAT GOES ON AND WE HAVE REPORTING AND THINGS LIKE\nTHAT THAT WE NEED TO GIVE OURSELVES A LITTLE BIT OF A\nBREAK. WE'RE HUMAN.\nWE HAVE OPINIONS. IT'S OKAY IF WE HAVE A LITTLE\nBIT OF LEANING ONE WAY OR THE OTHER IN THE MEDIA.\n>> SO FASCINATING THAT WE CAN LEARN SO MUCH FROM THAT TIME.\nAND IN OUR POLITICAL LANDSCAPE WE MAY THINK THINGS ARE UNIQUE,\nBUT HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF. >> THAT'S RIGHT, HISTORY CAN\nREPEAT ITSELF. >> PUT THAT UP SO FOLKS CAN\nAPPRECIATE IT.

HERE IS CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN\nMANAGER ROBBIE MOOK WHO SPOKE WITH CNN'S DANA BASH THIS\nMORNING. >> WHAT THE FOUNDATION DID WAS\nUNPRECEDENTED, AS I SAID, AND WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO IS\nGOING TO BE UNPRECEDENTED AS WELL.\nYOU TALK ABOUT TRANSPARENCY, DONALD TRUMP HAS RELEASED HIS\nTAXES. DONALD TRUMP HAS RELEASED A\nSERIOUS HEALTH LETTER YET. DONALD TRUMP REFUSES TO DISCLOSE\nTHE FULL ARCHITECTURE OF HIS FINANCIAL DEBTS AND OBLIGATIONS\nAROUND THE WORLD. WE JUST READ YESTERDAY IN \"THE\nNEW YORK TIMES\" THAT HE IS A DEBTOR TO THE BANK OF CHINA.\n>> ROBBY I ASKED ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON, NOT DONALD TRUMP.\nWE'RE GOING TO TALK LATER ABOUT THAT.\n>> WELL, BUT MY POINT IS THERE'S ALL THIS SCRUTINY BECAUSE\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN TRANSPARENT.\nYOU DON'T HEAR THESE QUESTIONS WHEN MEMBERS OF THE BUSH FAMILY\nCONTINUE TO SERVE ON BOARDS FOR THE FIRST PRESIDENT BUSH'S\nFOUNDATION. SO AS I SAID, THE FOUNDATION IS\nTAKING UNPRECEDENTED STEPS HERE. WE'RE VERY PROUD THAT THEY'RE\nDOING THAT, BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE HILLARY\nCLINTON BECOMES PRESIDENT AND LETTING THE FOUNDATION DO THE\nRETOOLING THAT THEY NEED TO DO. >> ALL RIGHT.\nLET'S TALK MORE ABOUT THAT WITH CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST RON\nBROWNSTEIN, A SENIOR EDITIOR FO \"THE ATLANTIC\" AND JAY NEWTON\nSMALLS. IS IT OKAY FOR THE FOUNDATION TO\nCONTINUE TO RECEIVE THIS MONEY UNTIL NOVEMBER?\n>> LOOK, IT'S A REAL QUESTION. THIS IS SUCH UNCHARTED WATERS.\nI MEAN, THAT IS THE ISSUE. THERE'S NO QUESTION THE\nFOUNDATION HAS DONE A LOT OF GOOD WORK OVER THE YEARS ON\nISSUES LIKE AIDS, DRUGS AND AFRICA, IT'S WORKED A LOT WITH\nREPUBLICAN. BUT A UNIQUE SITUATION FROM THE\nBEGINNING THAT'S GOTTEN MORE UNIQUE AND UNPRECEDENTED AS IT'S\nGONE. I DON'T THINK WE'VE EVER HAD A\nFORMER PRESIDENT WHO HAS BUILT AN INSTITUTION OF THIS MAGNITUDE\nTO DEAL WITH AS MANY ISSUES AS PRESIDENT CLINTON HAS DONE\nACTIVATING HIS GLOBAL NETWORK IN THIS WAY AND THEN TO HAVE ON TOP\nOF THAT HIS SPOUSE BECOME FIRST SECRETARY OF STATE, THEN THE\nDEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE, IT REALLY DOES KIND OF CHANGE\nTHE LANDSCAPE. AND I THINK THEY DO NEED TO LOOK\nVERY CAREFULLY AT THIS. BECAUSE MARTIN, I THINK ONE OF\nTHE BIG LESSONS OF ALL THE REVELATIONS WE'VE HAD OVER THE\nPAST MANY MONTHS IS THAT THERE WAS NOT A FULL SENSE OF PROPER\nGUARDRAILS BETWEEN ALL OF THE CLINTON INK AND HILLARY\nCLINTON'S KIND OF RENEWED PUBLIC SERVICE CAREER.\nAND IT IS SOMETHING THAT IF SHE'S ELECTED PRESIDENT, THEY'RE\nGOING TO HAVE TO BE MUCH MORE DILIGENT AND MUCH MORE FOCUSED\nABOUT SEPARATING AND THEY'RE GOING TO NEED SOME VOICES AROUND\nHER WHO ARE MORE ATTUNE TO THIS THAN THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND\nHER IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. >> JAY, EVEN WITHOUT FOREIGN\nMONEY, DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION HAS THE\nPOTENTIAL TO BE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST?\nDOES IT REMAIN A CONFLICT OF INTEREST IF BILL AND HILLARY\nTAKE, YOU KNOW, A HIATUS FROM LEADERSHIP AND, SAY, GIVE IT TO\nCHELSEA? IS IT STILL A PROBLEM?\n>> KEEP IN MINE, THIS IS A CHARITY HERE.\nIT IS NOT LIKE THIS MONEY IS GOING TO THEM PERSONALLY.\n>> RIGHT. >> THE MONEY IS ACTUALLY GOING\nTO BUILD, YOU KNOW, PROGRAMS IN THESE COUNTRIES THAT ARE FOR THE\nBETTERMENT OF THESE PEOPLE. SO WHAT I ALWAYS THINK IS REALLY\nINTERESTING HERE IS WOULD YOU PREFER THAT THESE COUNTRIES NOT\nINVEST IN THEIR OWN DEVELOPMENT? WOULD YOU PREFER THAT IT WAS\nJUST SORT OF MONEY GIVEN, DONATED BY AMERICANS OR DONATED\nBY FIRST WORLD COUNTRIES THAT IS THEN USED TO SORT OF DEVELOP\nTHEM? I MEAN, THAT SORT OF ALSO GOES\nAGAINST -- THEY WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT.\nTHEY WANT TO HAVE A SAY IN HOW THEY'RE DEVELOPED AND THAT'S WHY\nTHEY GIVE MONEY TO THESE PROJECTS.\n>> BUT IT'S THE PERCEPTION HERE. AND WE ALL AGREE IT DOES GOOD.\nIT'S THE PERCEPTION OF A PRESIDENT THAT SOMEHOW -- YOU\nDON'T EVEN WANT TO IMPLY THAT THEY COULD BE INFLUENCED BY A\nDONATION. >> MARTIN, I'M CLOSER TO THE\nIMPLICATION OF YOUR QUESTION, WHICH IS IF HILLARY CLINTON IS\nTHE PRESIDENT, BILL CLINTON IS GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT ADVISER\nWHETHER WITH A FORMAL ROLE OR NOT, HE WILL LITERALLY BE\nWHISPERING IN THE EAR OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nIT MAKES SENSE WHERE TO MAINTAIN THE OPERATION OF THIS FOUNDATION\nIF SHE IS PRESIDENT DURING HER PRESIDENCY.\nTHERE'S NO WAY TO COMPLETELY INSULATE, DESPITE THE GOOD WORK\nTHAT IT DOES, IT DOES PROVIDE KIND OF AN ALTERNATIVE MEANS FOR\nINTEREST NOT ONLY DOMESTICALLY BUT AROUND THE WORLD.\nSO TOO REACH SOMEONE THAT WILL BE WITHIN REACH OF THE\nPRESIDENT. I WOULD IMAGINE -- I'VE GOT TO\nTHINK THAT WHOEVER IS THE CHIEF OF STAFF IN THE WHITE HOUSE WILL\nLOOK VERY HARD AND ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS IF HILLARY CLINTON\nWINS ABOUT WHETHER IT MAKES SENSE TO MAINTAIN THIS\nORGANIZATION. >> AND YOU KNOW, JAY, I'M\nTHINKING THAT FOR ESPECIALLY THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, THEY COULD USE\nTHIS. THIS IS LEVERAGE OBVIOUSLY\nAGAINST HILLARY CLINTON HERE. >> ABSOLUTELY.\n>> AND ONCE AGAIN SEEMS TO REINFORCE A PUBLIC FEELING,\nRIGHT OR WRONG, THAT THE RULES DON'T APPLY THE SAME WAY TO\nHILLARY CLINTON, THE CLINTONS IN GENERAL.\n>> ABSOLUTELY, MARTIN. LOOK, DONALD TRUMP JUST SENT OUT\nA PRESS RELEASE AN HOUR OR AN HOUR AND A HALF AGO CALLING ON\nTHE CLINTONS TO SUSPEND THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nHE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE. THERE HAVE BEEN CALLS ON THE\nHUFFINGTON POST FROM THE LEFT AND FROM THE RIGHT SAYING THAT\nIT'S A MAJOR CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND THEY SHOW JUST SHUT\nIT DOWN FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES EVEN IF SHE WINS THE\nELECTION, EVEN BEFORE THEN, SUSPEND IT RIGHT NOW.\n>> SHUT IT DOWN COMPLETELY OR IS THERE NOT SOME WAY THIS COULD BE\nHANDLED? BECAUSE IT DOES DO A LOT OF\nGOOD. >> WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE PAST\nIS POLITICIANS, MICHAEL BLOOMBERG, WHEN HE BECAME MAYOR\nOF NEW YORK, HE SEPARATED HIMSELF FROM THE PHILANTHROPIES\nTHAT HE WORKED WITH AND THEY CONTINUED ONWARDS.\nIT BECAME A BLIND TRUST. SO IF YOU TREAT THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION LIKE A COMPANY AND YOU ENTRUST SOMEBODY WHO YOU\nREALLY CLOSE FRIEND OR A CLOSE COLLEAGUE, SOMEBODY YOU REALLY\nTRUST WITH THE RUNNING OF IT, I MEAN, THAT SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD\nBE A GOOD SOLUTION. IT CONTINUES TO DO GOOD WORK AND\nSEPARATE FROM THE -- >> WE'VE GOT DONALD TRUMP WHO\nHAS GOT THIS PROBLEM. >> YEAH.\n>> ALL OF THOSE INVESTMENTS THAT NOW ARE NOT GOING TO BE A BLIND\nTRUST. WE UNDERSTAND IT WILL BE, WHAT,\nHANDLED BY FAMILY MEMBERS? >> LOOK, IT IS VERY HARD.\nIT'S AN INTERESTING IDEA THAT YOU COULD HANDLE A PHILANTHROPY\nLIKE A BLIND TRUST, LIKE A COMPANY LIKE YOUR INVESTMENTS.\nAND I THINK FOR BOTH OF THESE CANDIDATES HAVE ENORMOUSLY\nCOMPLICATED FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIPS, BUT TO GET BACK\nTO CLINTON FOR ONE MOMENT, I THINK THAT IF YOU LOOK MORE\nBROADLY AT ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT SHE'S BEEN DEALING WITH IN\nTHE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AS A CANDIDATE, ALL THE SPILLOVER\nFROM THE E-MAILS NOW FROM THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, TO ME WHAT\nIT SAYS IS YOU NEED A STRONG INDEPENDENT VOICE AROUND HER\nTHAT IS A CLEAR SENSE OF KIND OF WHAT THE GUARDRAILS NEED TO BE.\nBILL CLINTON IS AN EXTRAORDINARY HUMAN BEING WHO HAS AN\nEXTRAORDINARY NETWORK GLOBALLY. HE'S A TRUE GLOBAL CITIZEN AND\nHE'S REALLY KIND OF UNMATCHED IN THAT WAY.\nHE HAS TRIED TO LEVERAGE THAT TO ADVANCE THE CAUSES THAT HE CARES\nABOUT, BUT IF ONE OF THE CAUSES HE CARES ABOUT IS THE POTENTIAL\nPRESIDENCY OF HIS WIFE IT MAKES SENSE TO HAVE STRONGER\nBOUNDARIES BETWEEN WHAT HE HAS BEEN DOING AND HIS PUBLIC\nSERVICE THAN THEY HAVE PUT TOGETHER SO FAR.\nI THINK THAT IS GOING TO BE ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT KIND OF\nCOMPLEX JOBS FOR THE NEXT -- IF SHE IS PRESIDENT, THE NEXT CHIEF\nOF STAFF. >> RON, I'M SORRY, I HAVE TO\nWRAP IT THERE ONLY BECAUSE WE'RE ONLY JUST ABOUT OUT OF TIME.\nAND JAY NEWTON SMALL, THANK YOU. WE APPRECIATE YOUR INSIGHTS\nGREATLY.",

I THINK THEY ARE TRYING TO\nOUTLINE THE AGENDA IN DETAIL TO PROVIDE WHAT A CLINTON WHITE\nHOUSE WOULD LOOK LIKE. SO VOTERS REALLY WANT THAT\nVISION.

AND TO BE FAIR, HE HAS RUN A\nRELATIVELY WEAK CAMPAIGN UP UNTIL A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO.\nON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY, WE SAW A MUCH DIFFERENT TRUMP.\nWE SAW TRUMP STRONG, YET HUMBLE. A TRUMP THAT WILL ADMIT TO HIS\nMISTAKES. AND IF HE KEEPS ON THAT PATH,\nHILLARY SHOULD NOT ASSUME SHE IS GOING TO WIN.\nTRUMP COULD APPEAL TO A LOT OF VOTERS IF HE KEEPS ON THIS PATH\nOF STRENGTH, YET BEING HUMBLE AND TALKING ABOUT US, THE\nVOTERS, INSTEAD OF FOCUSSING ON HIMSELF AND PERSONALLY ATTACKING\nHIS CRITICS. >> A NEW TRUMP AND WE COULD LOOK\nFOR THAT. TARYN, ALSO A STAFFER IS SAYING\nIF HILLARY CLINTON WINS, IT WILL BE AN UPHILL BATTLE.\nHERE IS THE QUOTE. I DON'T THINK ANY PRESIDENT HAS\nCOME TO OFFICE UNDER WATER ON THEIR FAVORABLE IMAGE.\nOR AS UNDER WATER. THIS WOULD BE UNCHARTED WATERS\nCOMING TO AN OFFICE AS AN UNPOPULAR PERSON.\nYOU DON'T HAVE A GOODWILL TO DRAW ON EVEN IN THE FIRST 100\nDAYS. HOW WILL THAT AFFECT HER INITIAL\nPRODUCTIVITY, AGAIN, IF SHE WINS.\n>> RIGHT. ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS SHE\nWOULD HAVE TO DO IS DWANE AND WORK FOR REPUBLICAN SUPPORT FOR\nCONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE SHE GETS THAT\nDONE. THAT BEING SAID, I THINK THERE\nIS A LOT OF ROOM FOR HER TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT.\nBECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A LETTER THAT CAME FROM CONGRESSIONAL\nREPUBLICANS, OVER A HUNDRED OF THEM, JUST THE OTHER DAY I'VE\nSEEN THE RNC TO PULL SUPPORT FROM TRUMP.\nI THINK THERE IS FOR HIS DIVISIVENESS AND RECKLESSNESS.\nI THAT I THERE IS DEFINITELY SOME MOVEMENT HERE THAT IF THE\nSCENARIO IS THAT SHE WINS, AND IF SHE WINS, THAT THERE WOULD BE\nSOME MOVEMENT TOWARDS HER AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE BECAUSE I\nTHINK IT IS WINNING WE ALL KNOW IS CLEAR AS THE COUNTRY IS\nCLAMORING FOR IMMIGRATION REFORM.\nTHAT'S WHY WE HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONES.\nAND SPECIFICALLY THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE BIPARTISAN.\nSO WE WOULD HAVE TO REACH ACROSS.\n>> OKAY. I WILL BRING UP SOMETHING ELSE.\nAMIDST THE CHANGES WE HAVE SEEN IN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION ANNOUNCED IT IS NOT GOING TO ACCEPT FOREIGN\nDONATION FESS CLINTON WINS.

WHY NOT DO IT WHILE SHE IS\nRUNNING FOR PRESIDENT? >> THE FOUNDATION IS DOING AN\nENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WORK AND IT TAKES TIME WHEN YOU'RE IN A\nNUMBER OF COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD TO RETOOL, REFOCUS THE\nMISSION, AND ADAPT. AS YOU SAID, THEY RECEIVE A\nGREAT DEAL OF FUNDING THROUGH THESE STREAMS AND IT'LL JUST\nTAKE SOME TIME FOR THEM TO READJUST.\n>> KRISTIN, IS IT OKAY FOR THE FOUNDATION TO CONTINUE TO\nRECEIVE FOREIGN MONEY UP UNTIL NOVEMBER?\n>> ABSOLUTELY NOT. LOOK, THE DAMAGE HAS ALREADY\nBEEN DONE. CLINTON FOUNDATION ACCEPTED TENS\nOF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM FOREIGN ENTITIES.\nIF SHOULD HAVE BEEN SHUT DOWN A LONG TIME AGO.\nBUT THIS JUST SPEAKS TO HOW WEAK A CANDIDATE HILLARY CLINTON IS.\nSHE IS SUCH A BEATABLE CANDIDATE.\nAND THIS IS WHY IT IS SO CRITICAL FOR TRUMP TO STAY ON\nTRACK, FOCUS ON THE ISSUES, AND HE CAN BEAT HER.\nAND MARTIN WE ALSO HAVE TO POINT OUT HERE THAT A LOT OF AMERICANS\nHAVE NOT REALLY TUNED IN CLOSELY TO THIS RACE YET.\nA LOT OF THIS WILL COME DOWN TO THE FIRST DEBATE.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE WILL START PAYING ATTENTION AFTER THE FIRST\nDEBATE AND DURING THE FIRST DEBATE.\nIF TRUMP CAN DO A GOOD JOB THERE HILLARY HAS GOT TO BE CAREFUL.\nSHE SHOULD NOT TAKE FOR GRANTED SHE HAS THIS IN THE BAG.\n>> AND THAT'S WHERE THIS WHOLE CONVERSATION BEGAN.\nTHANK YOU.",

SO IF IT'S NOT OKAY TO TAKE THIS\nMONEY AS PRESIDENT, WHY WAS IT OKAY TO TAKE IT AS SECRETARY OF\nSTATE? >> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, WHEN THE\nRULES WERE PUT IN PLACE IN 2009, THEY WERE A BIG BURDEN ON THE\nFOUNDATION. AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER\nWHAT THE FOUNDATION DOES. OVER 10 MILLION PEOPLE AROUND\nTHE WORLD GET IMPORTANT AIDS MEDICATION, LIFE-SAVING AIDS AND\nHIV MEDICATION BECAUSE OF THE FOUNDATION.\nIT'S REDUCED THE COST OF MALARIA DRUGS BY MORE THAN 90%.\nTHIS IS IMPORTANT, LIFE-SAVING WORK.\nTHERE ARE SOME FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS LIKE AUSTRALIA AND\nNORWAY THAT WERE -- THAT HAD EXISTING DONATIONS TO THE\nFOUNDATION AND THE FOUNDATION WANTED THEM TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW\nTHROUGH ON THEIR COMMITMENTS SO THE WORK COULD BE PROTECTED.\nBUT IT WAS AN UNPRECEDENTED STEP THEY TOOK BACK IN 2009, AND THE\nFOUNDATION IS SAYING THEY'RE PREPARED TO MAKE AN\nUNPRECEDENTED STEP SHOULD HILLARY BECOME PRESIDENT TO GO\nEVEN FURTHER IN TERMS OF DISCLOSURE AND LIMITS.\n>> BUT IF THIS IS THE RIGHT POLICY NOW, WHY NOT DO IT NOW?\nWHY WAIT UNTIL THE IDEA OF HER BEING PRESIDENT.\nWHY NOT DO IT WHEN SHE IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT?\n>> THE FOUNDATION IS DOING AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WORK, AND IT\nTAKES TIME WHEN YOU'RE IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES AROUND THE\nWORLD TO RETOOL, REFOCUS THE MISSION, AND ADAPT.\nAS YOU SAID, THEY RECEIVE A GREAT DEAL OF FUNDING THROUGH\nTHESE STREAMS. IT WILL JUST TAKE SOME TIME FOR\nTHEM TO READJUST. LOOK, WHAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON\nRIGHT NOW IS MAKING SURE HILLARY CLINTON IS ELECTED PRESIDENT, SO\nNOBODY WANTS TO GET AHEAD OF THEMSELVES.\nBUT WE'RE GLAD TO HEAR THAT THEY HAVE ONCE AGAIN TAKEN AN\nUNPRECEDENTED STEP IN TERMS OF TRANSPARENCY AND RULES.\n>> ROBBY, I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND THIS.\nPART OF THE ISSUE WITH A LOT OF VOTERS KEEPING HER FROM BEING\nPRESIDENT, KEEPING VOTERS FROM GOING INTO THE BOOTH AND VOTING\nFOR HER, IS THEY THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF\nQUESTIONS ABOUT THE INTEGRITY OR HONESTY OF HER EXPERIENCE IN\nPOLITICS AND THAT THIS IS ONE OF THEM.\nSO, CONSIDERING THAT, WHY NOT, IF YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS\nSTEP, DO NOW TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THERE IS NO ISSUE HERE WITH HER\nACCEPTING FOREIGN DONATIONS OR OTHERS FROM PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE\nTRYING TO AFFECT HER AND TRYING TO GET AROUND GIVING IT TO THE\nCAMPAIGN THE WAY ANYBODY ELSE WOULD IS.\n>> WHAT THE FOUNDATION DID WAS UNPRECEDENTED AS I SAID, WHAT\nTHEY'RE GOING TO DO IS UNPRECEDENTED AS WELL.\nTALK ABOUT TRANSPARENCY. DONALD TRUMP HASN'T RELEASED HIS\nTAXES. DONALD TRUMP HASN'T RELEASED A\nSERIOUS HEALTH LETTER YET. DONALD TRUMP REFUSES TO DISCLOSE\nTHE FULL ARCHITECTURE OF HIS FINANCIAL DEBTS AND OBLIGATIONS\nAROUND THE WORLD. WE JUST READ YESTERDAY IN THE\n\"NEW YORK TIMES\" THAT HE IS A DEBTOR TO THE BANK OF CHINA.\nNO ONE HAD DISCLOSED THIS. >> I ASKED ABOUT HILLARY\nCLINTON, NOT DONALD TRUMP. WE'LL TALK LATER ABOUT THAT.\n>> WELL -- BUT MY POINT IS THAT THERE IS ALL THIS SCRUTINY\nBECAUSE SHE HAS BEEN TRANSPARENT.\nI DON'T THINK YOU HEARD THESE QUESTIONS WHEN MEMBERS OF THE\nBUSH FAMILY CONTINUED TO SERVE ON BOARDS FOR THE FIRST\nPRESIDENT BUSH'S FOUNDATION. SO, AS I SAID, THE FOUNDATION IS\nTAKING UNPRECEDENTED STEPS HERE. WE'RE VERY PROUD THAT THEY'RE\nDOING THAT. BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE FOCUSED ON\nMAKING SURE HILLARY CLINTON BECOMES PRESIDENT AND LETTING\nTHE FOUNDATION DO THE RETOOLING THAT THEY NEED TO DO.\n>> A NEW BATCH OF STATE DEPARTMENT E-MAILS WERE RELEASED\nLAST WEEK SHOWING DOUG BAND, A COUNSELOR TO THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION, ASKING CLINTON ADVISERS HUMO ABEDIN AND CHERYL\nMILLS, STATE DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEES AT THE TIME FOR A\nFAVOR. HE FORWARDED AN E-MAIL FROM A\nCLINTON FOUNDATION DONOR AND TOLD THEM IT WAS IMPORTANT TO\nTAKE CARE OF THE REQUEST. HUMA SAID, WE'VE ALL HAD HIM ON\nOUR RADAR. PERSONNEL HAS BEEN SENDING HIM\nOPTIONS. IS THIS THE KIND OF BACK\nSCRATCHING THAT HAS AMERICANS TURNED OFF AND DONE WITH\nPOLITICIANS WHO HAVE BEEN IN WASHINGTON FOR A LONG TIME?\n>> THE QUESTION WAS COMING FROM HIS PRIVATE E-MAIL ACCOUNT.\nOR HIS CLINTON.COM E-MAIL ACCOUNT.\nIT WAS NOT RELATED TO THE FOUNDATION.\nAND THE FOUNDATION AT EVERY STEP -- RATHER, EXCUSE ME, THE\nSTATE DEPARTMENT AT EVERY STEP WAS FOLLOWING ALL THE\nAPPROPRIATE PROTOCOLS. THIS WAS SOMEONE WHO HAD A\nRELATIONSHIP WITH THE CLINTONS LONG BEFORE HILLARY BECAME\nSECRETARY OF STATE. >> BUT ROBBY, THE ISSUE IS NOT\nSO MUCH WHERE THE E-MAIL IS COMING FROM.\nIT'S THE REQUEST IN GENERAL. WHO THE REQUEST IS GOING TO,\nRIGHT? >> WELL, AGAIN, THIS IS SOMEONE\nWHO HAD A LONG-STANDING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CLINTONS,\nWHO HAD WANTED TO PROVIDE SOME INSIGHT INTO A MATTER.\nAND OBVIOUSLY THE CLINTONS HAVE STAFF THAT FACILITATE THOSE\nSORTS OF COMMUNICATIONS. THERE WAS NO QUID PRO QUO OR\nANYTHING LIKE THAT HERE. AS I SAID, THE E-MAIL ORIGINATED\nFROM PRESIDENT CLINTON'S PRIVATE OFFICE.\n>> A FEDERAL JUDGE ON FRIDAY ORDERED HILLARY CLINTON TO\nPROVIDE WRITTEN TESTIMONY ABOUT HER PRIVATE SERVER.\nYOU'LL GET THE QUESTIONS BY OCTOBER 14th, AND YOU'RE GOING\nTO HAVE 30 DAYS TO ANSWER THEM. THEORETICALLY, YOU WON'T HAVE TO\nANSWER THE QUESTIONS UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION.\nYOU WERE TALKING ABOUT TRANSPARENCY AND HOW TRANSPARENT\nSECRETARY CLINTON HAS BEEN. GIVEN THAT, IN THE NAME OF\nTRANSPARENCY, WILL SHE WORK TO PRODUCE THOSE ANSWERS AND MAKE\nTHEM PUBLIC BEFORE THE ELECTION ON NOVEMBER 8th?\n>> WELL, AS YOU MENTIONED, THE JUDGE HAS SET A DEADLINE WHEREBY\nTHE GROUP IN QUESTION NEEDS TO SUBMIT THOSE.\nAND WHEN THEY'RE RECEIVED, I KNOW THE SECRETARY WILL GET TO\nWORK RIGHT AWAY ON ANSWERING THEM.\nBUT LET'S STEP BACK AND LOOK AT THE ORIGIN OF ALL OF THIS.\nTHE RIGHT WING AND REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS ARE NOT SATISFIED\nWITH THE ANSWER THAT THE CAREER PROFESSIONALS AT THE FBI AND\nJUSTICE DEPARTMENT GAVE. THEY SAID THERE WAS NO CASE\nHERE. THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A\nRIGHT-WING GROUP TRYING TO KEEP THE QUESTIONS COMING AND KEEP\nTHIS ISSUE ALIVE. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE ALL THE\nINFORMATION. THE E-MAILS HAVE BEEN RELEASED.\nTHEY HAVE ENOUGH TO MAKE A JUDGMENT AT THIS POINT.\nWE AT THE CAMPAIGN JUST WANT TO MOVE ON AND TALK ABOUT THE\nISSUES THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT IN THIS ELECTION, LIKE\nJOBS, COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY AND HEALTH CARE.\n>> THAT SOUNDS LIKE A NO. >> AS I SAID, AS SOON AS SHE\nRECEIVES THE QUESTION, IF THE JUDGE ASKS HER TO ANSWER THOSE\nQUESTIONS, SHE'LL GET TO WORK RIGHT AWAY ON GETTING THE\nQUESTIONS ANSWERED. >> YOU'RE FACING AN INCREDIBLY\nDELICATE TASK, LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY TO PLAY DONALD TRUMP IN\nMOCK DEBATES FOR HILLARY CLINTON'S DEBATE PREP.\nSOMEBODY WHO IS GOING TO BRING UP SOME TOPICS THAT YOUR\nCANDIDATE PROBABLY WOULD RATHER FORGET.\nHAVE YOU SETTLED ON THAT PERSON? >> WELL, WE HAVEN'T YET.\nIT'S VERY HARD TO FIND SOMEONE TO MIMIC THE RECKLESS\nTEMPERAMENT AND THE HATEFUL INSTINCTS AND DIVISIVE INSTINCTS\nOF DONALD TRUMP. PREPARING FOR A DEBATE WITH HIM\nIS A CHALLENGING TASK BUT SECRETARY CLINTON IS LOOKING\nFORWARD TO THE DEBATE. I THINK YOU'LL SEE A REAL\nDIFFERENCE BETWEEN STEADY LEADERSHIP AND A VERY RECKLESS\nTEMPERAMENT. >> IS IT THAT OR FINDING SOMEONE\nWHO KNOWS HILLARY CLINTON WELL AND IS WILLING TO SAY SOME\nPRETTY TOUGH THINGS TO HER? >> SHE HAS BEEN IN THIS GAME A\nLONG TIME AND HAD A LOT OF TOUGH THINGS SAID TO HER.\nTHAT'S NOT THE CHALLENGE HERE. THE CHALLENGE IS FINDING SOMEONE\nWHO CAN RECREATE THE KIND OF RECKLESS TEMPERAMENT, THE KIND\nOF HATEFUL LANGUAGE AND DIVISIVE LANGUAGE THAT'S BECOME TRUMP'S\nHALLMARK. WE'LL GET IT DONE.\nWE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE DEBATES.\n>> ROBBY MOOK. THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME.\n>> THANKS.",

THE TIMING, MORE THAN A LITTLE\nCURIOUS. DONALD TRUMP OF LATE HAS BEEN\nMUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE IN QUESTIONING CLINTON'S ETHICS.\n>> WHILE OUR COUNTRY LOST BADLY UNDER HILLARY CLINTON, SHE\nCASHED IN BIG-TIME. THERE WAS ALL THE MONEY FUNNELED\nINTO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION FROM FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND\nCORPORATIONS. IT WAS PAY FOR PLAY.\nIN A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, THE STATE DEPARTMENT WILL WORK FOR\nTHE COUNTRY, NOT FOR HILLARY CLINTON'S DONORS.\n>> IT'S NOT JUST THE CANDIDATE. THE NEW CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN COMES FROM A CONSERVATIVE WEBSITE WHICH HAS\nLONG ACCUSED THE CLINTONS OF CORRUPTION.\n>> A NEW REPORT TODAY CLAIMS THE CLINTON FOUNDATION GIVES ABOUT\n10% OF ITS MONEY THAT IT RAISES TO ACTUAL CHARITIES.\n>> ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY HAVE FLOWED TO THE CLINTONS FROM\nFOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, FOREIGN FINANCIERS AND BUSINESSES.\n>> NOW, THIS CHANGE, IF SHE BECOMES PRESIDENT, AND THERE ARE\nALREADY PEOPLE SEEING LOOPHOLES IN THE CHANGE, BUT -- SURPRISE,\nYEAH -- WE WON'T TAKE FOREIGN MONEY, WON'T TAKE CORPORATION\nMONEY. BILL CLINTON WON'T GIVE PAID\nSPEECHES. HE IS NOT GIVING ANY RIGHT NOW.\nCO THE BOSTON GLOBE SAID A WEEK AGO\nSHE SHOULD SHUT IT DOWN THEY SAY WHY DIDN'T IT POSE A PROBLEM AS\nSECRETARY OF STATE. THE ANSWER IS IT DID AND DOES\nAND THEY KNOW IT. >> THE CLINTONS WILL GET AWAY\nWITH WHATEVER THEY CAN FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.\nIT VIOLATE THE SPIRIT OF ETHICAL AGREEMENTS OR LAWS.\nTHIS IS HOW THEY DO BUSINESS. TRUMP AND SHE ARE FIGHTING ON\nEQUALLY UNLIKABLE UNPOPULAR GROUNDS HERE.\nTHIS IS ANOTHER THING WHERE, HAD SHE DONE IT SIX MONTHS AGO, THE\nSTORY WOULD BE DIFFERENT NOW. HE IS WILLING TO BE EXTREMELY\nFRANK ABOUT HER BEHAVIOR. THAT WILL BE A WEAKNESS FOR HER.\n>> THIS WILL BE AN INTERESTING DEBATE.\nWHETHER TRUMP CAN CARRY THIS IN THE DEBATE OR WHETHER SHE TURNS\nTHE TRUMP INDUSTRIES AND FINANCES --\n>> HE HAS A CLEANER ARGUMENT NOW THAT MANAFORT IS NO LONGER WITH\nTHE CAMPAIGN. HE WAS A BIT OF A LIABILITY\nBECAUSE OF HIS OVERSEAS DEALINGS AS WELL.\nI THINK THIS IS A POWERFUL ARGUMENT THAT THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN -- THAT TRUMP HIMSELF CAN MAKE.\nIT'S SORT OF -- EITHER REAL CORRUPTION OR THE SPECTER OF\nCORRUPTION. A WHIFF OF PAY FOR PLAY.\n>> CAN YOU EXPECT THIS WOMAN TO CHANGE WASHINGTON.\n>> WE DID AN ANALYSIS OVER THE WEEKEND THAT FOUND HALF OF THE\nMONEY WOULD HAVE FALLEN UNDER THE RULES THAT ARE NOW BANNED\nFOR DONATION. IT'S A REAL THING FOR THEM THAT\nGOING BACK TO HER STATE DEPARTMENT YEARS, SHE WAS -- HER\nFAMILY FOUNDATION WAS ACCEPTING MONEY FROM FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS\nAND ENTITIES IN WAYS THAT THEY ARE ACKNOWLEDGING IS BASICALLY\nUNETHICAL -- OR WOULD BE UNETHICAL COME NOVEMBER.\n>> THEIR BIG GATHERING IS THIS FALL.\nSO IT WILL COME UP AGAIN. >> THE FACT THAT SHE WAS DOING\nTHIS WHILE SECRETARY OF STATE, TAKING I MEAN BIG MONEY FROM THE\nSAUDIS, FOR EXAMPLE. WHERE ARE THE ADS?\nIT'S ONE MORE EXAMPLE OF JUST -- IF YOU HAD A FUNCTIONAL\nOPPOSITION, CAN YOU IMAGINE THE KIND OF ATTACKS THAT COULD BE\nLAUNCHED? NOW AT ALMOST LABOR DAY TO SAY,\nIF SHE IS PRESIDENT WE'LL SHUT IT DOWN.\nIT'S SUCH EASY FODDER. ONE FAST POINT.\nTHIS IS PART OF HER CHALLENGE WITH YOUNGER VOTERS.\nTHIS IS PART OF THE REASON WHY SHE WAS VULNERABLE AGAINST\nBERNIE. NOT BECAUSE OF IDEALOGICAL\nISSUES BUT THE SPECTER AND UNSEEMLINESS OF SOME OF THEIR\nFINANCIAL DEALINGS. IT SEEMS SO CYNICAL.\nTHIS IS PART OF HER CHALLENGE. TRUMP HAS BEEN A GIFT, BUT THIS\nIS PART OF HER CHALLENGE, WINNING OVER YOUNGER, MORE\nIDEALISTIC VOTERS. >> YOU HAVE JUDICIAL WATCH ABOUT\nTRYING TO GET THE E-MAILS OUT. IT FILES A LOT OF SUITS TO GET\nGOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS. IF YOU ARE A FAN OF\nTRANSPARENCY, YOU SHOULD SUPPORT THAT ASPECT.\nA JUDGE HAS SAID THEY WANT TO DEPOSE HER.\nTHE JUDGE SAID NO. YOU DON'T GET A DEPOSITION IN\nPERSON BUT SHE'LL ANSWER WRITTEN QUESTIONS.\nWE SAW REPORTS THIS WEEK THAT IN HER FBI INTERVIEW SHE SAID, I\nHAD THE PERSONAL E-MAIL ACCOUNT BECAUSE COLIN POWELL TOLD ME\nTHAT'S THE WAY TO DO THINGS. IS THERE A POSSIBILITY -- SHE\nAND HER LAWYERS WILL ANSWER THE QUESTIONS FROM JUDICIAL WATCH.\nI ASSUME THEY'LL BE EXTRA CAREFUL BUT IT STILL RAISES THE\nPER POSSIBILITY THAT WE'RE NOT DONE\nHERE. >> MOST PEOPLE IN THE POLLS\nTHINK SOMETHING UNETHICAL HAPPENED.\nBUT THEY ALSO SUGGEST PEOPLE ARE SICK OF HEARING ABOUT HER\nE-MAILS. THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS VOTING\nON THE LATTER, THEY HAVE TO BE WORRIED ABOUT THE DRIP, DRIP,\nDRIP OF THIS AND IF THEY CAN ESSENTIALLY START TO LOSE THIS\nTHING SORT OF A DEATH BY A THOUSAND CUTS.\n>> EVEN WHILE VOTERS ARE MAYBE SICK OF THE SORT OF ATMOSPHERE\nOF TALKING ABOUT THESE E-MAILS AND THE CONTROVERSY, EVERY TIME\nTHAT SOMETHING COMES OUT THAT'S CONCRETE LIKE THESE MOST RECENT\nE-MAILS THAT REVEALED THINGS ABOUT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION OR\nWHATEVER WE MAY HEAR FROM HER FBI INTERVIEWS OR FROM THE\nDEPOSITIONS TO COME, IT GIVES MORE CONCRETE FODDER FOR VOTERS\nTO LATCH ONTO. SO THEY CAN SAY IT'S NOT JUST\nTHAT THEY FEEL SHE IS UNTRUSTWORTHY BUT THEY CAN POINT\nTO SOMETHING. THEY'RE DEALING WITH THE DRIP,\nDRIP, DRIP OF REAL THINGS. >> JIM COMEY VALIDATING IT WITH\nHIS SEARING STATEMENT. >> WE'LL SEE IF TRUMP CAN GET IN\nPOSITION CLOSE ENOUGH TO MAKE",

DAN, LET ME START BY GOING BACK\nTO WHAT JAMES SAID AT THE END OF THAT LAST BLOCK, THIS IS A\nWINNER FOR TRUMP ON RESTRICTS IMMIGRATION FROM COUNTRIES WITH\nA HISTORY OF TERRORISM. >> AS YOU SUGGESTED, PAUL, THERE\nARE TWO TRUMPS RUNNING AT THE MOMENT.\nTHERE'S THE ONE IN THAT AD AND THE ONE IN THAT NORTH CAROLINA\nSPEECH. HE SAID HE WILL CREATE A SYSTEM\nOF IMMIGRATION THAT ALLOWS IMMIGRATION TO WORK, PERHAPS\nAPPEALING TO THOSE REPUBLICANS WHO THINK WE NEED A SYSTEM OF\nIMMIGRATION THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO COME IN AND GO BACK OUT.\nBUT I DON'T THINK ATTACKING IMMIGRANTS LIKE THAT IS GOING TO\nWIN HIM VOTES IN, SAY, PENNSYLVANIA OR VIRGINIA OR\nWISCONSIN, THE BATTLEGROUND STATES.\n>> I THINK WHERE IT CAN BE A WINNING ISSUE IS IN HOW HE\nDESCRIBES THE THREAT. THIS IS THE POLITICALLY\nINCORRECT TRUMP THAT A LOT OF THOSE VOTERS LIKE.\nHE AT LEAST IS GOING TO CALL IT WHAT IT IS.\nHE'S NOT GOING TO PRETEND LIKE THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS,\nLIKE CLINTON ADD. HE'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT -- HE'S\nGOING TO CALL THE THREAT WHAT IT IS, RADICAL ISLAM.\nI THINK THAT IS A WINNING ISSUE FOR HIM.\nTHERE WAS A LOT OF GOOD STUFF IN THAT SPEECH.\nHE TALKED ABOUT CREATING THIS VACUUM THAT ISIS HAS FILLED.\nAT THE SAME TIME, A LOT OF TRUMP'S FOREIGN POLICY IS\nSIMILAR TO OBAMA'S AND THE ISOLATIONIST STRAIN.\n>> I THOUGHT THE CRITIQUE OF THE OBAMA/CLINTON RECORD WAS A LOT\nSTRONGER THAN HIS PROGRAMS AND A LOT CLEARER WHAT HE LAID OUT\nWOULD BE THE DIFFERENCES. IN TERMS OF TAKING OUT ISIS, HE\nSAID HE'LL DO IT FASTER AND VICIOUSLY IF HE HAS TO.\nHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY DETAILS ABOUT HOW TO DO IT OVERSEAS IN SYRIA,\nIRAQ, LIBYA OR ANYTHING ELSE. >> HE HAS SAID A COUPLE THINGS\nTHAT RESONATE. HE WANTS TO WORK WITH ALLIES.\nPEOPLE KIND OF WONDERED ABOUT THAT.\n>> THANK YOU. >> BUT HE'S ALSO -- IT'S A VERY\nFOCUSED STRATEGY. HE'S SAYING I WANT TO KILL ISIS,\nI WANT TO GET RID OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO KILL US.\nI DON'T WANT TO DONATION  -- DO\nNATION BUILDING. A LOT OF PRESIDENTS DEALING WITH\nTHE MIDDLE EAST REGION, I THINK --\n>> TALKS ABOUT COURTING MODERATE MUSLIMS WHICH I THINK IS\nSOMETHING WE NEED TO DO. >> BUT YOU GUYS HAVE LOW BARS --\n>> HOW -- WHAT DO YOU THINK THE BIG DIFFERENCES ARE BETWEEN\nTRUMP'S ANTI-TERROR STRATEGY AND HILLARY CLINTON'S?\n>> WELL, LOOK, I MEAN, HILLARY CLINTON HAS BASICALLY SAID SHE\nWILL CONTINUE BARACK OBAMA'S FOREIGN POLICY STRATEGY AND\nDONALD TRUMP DID VERY WELL CRITIQUE THAT IN THAT SPEECH.\nI THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WOULD MATTER IF HE IS GOING TO\nTALK, AS JASON SAID, MORE OPENLY ABOUT WHAT THE THREAT IS, AND\nTRY TO MAYBE PROSECUTE THIS IN A LOT MORE AGGRESSIVE WAY.\nTHE SPECIFICS, PAUL, THIS IS A PROBLEM, WHAT'S MISSING.\nI DISAGREE A LITTLE BIT WITH JAMES ON THE IDEA THAT THERE IS\nA DISTINCTION HERE BETWEEN TRUMP AND OBAMA ON SOME OF THESE\nQUESTIONS. HE'S BEEN VERY RETICENT FOR\nINSTANCE TO SAY WHAT HE WOULD DO IN SYRIA.\nTHERE ARE THINGS YOU CAN DO THAT ARE SHORT OF BOOTS ON THE\nGROUND, BUT WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THAT COMMITMENT FROM HIM.\nTHIS IS ONE OF THE LACKIN ASPECTS OF HIS FOREIGN POLICY.\n>> I WANT TO GET INTO THE NEWS THIS WEEK THAT THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION -- THIS RELATES TO FOREIGN POLICY BECAUSE THEY HAVE\nACCEPTED FOREIGN DONATIONS IN THE PAST.\nNOW THEY'RE SAYING THEY WON'T ACCEPT ANY FOREIGN DONATIONS.\nTHEY PROMISED EIGHT YEARS AGO THAT THEY WOULDN'T ACCEPT ANY\nFOREIGN DONATIONS WHEN HILLARY WAS SECRETARY OF STATE.\nWHY SHOULD WE BELIEVE THEM NOW? >> WELL, THERE'S NO REASON WE\nSHOULD BELIEVE THEM. FORMER PENNSYLVANIA GOVERNOR ED\nRENDELL SUGGESTED IF SHE WINS, THEY SHOULD CLOSE THE\nFOUNDATION. THEY'RE AFRAID THAT IF THEY KEEP\nTHE FOUNDATION OPEN, SOMETHING WILL BE IN THERE THAT WILL ALLOW\nHILLARY CLINTON TO BE IMPEACHED. >> THEY'LL USE IT AS A\nFUNDRAISER FOR CHELSEA CLINTON'S SENATE CAMPAIGN.\n>> THIS IS MARKET. IT'S LIKE WHEN A CAR DEALER SAYS\nYOU GOT TO GET IN HERE BY LABOR DAY OR THESE DEALS ARE GOING\nAWAY. THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE SAYING.\nWE KNOW IT WILL CONTINUE JUST AS THE DEALERSHIP WILL CONTINUE.\n>> EVEN MORE TO THE POINT, WHAT CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WILL\nSUDDENLY ARISE WHEN SHE'S PRESIDENT THAT WEREN'T THERE\nWHEN SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE, THE CHIEF DIPLOMAT OF THE\nCOUNTRY IN DEALING WITH FOREIGN DONATIONS.\n>> SHOULDN'T THEY SHUT IT DOWN? >> OF COURSE.\n>> KIM, GO AHEAD. >> ALSO BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT\nSAYING YOU'RE NOT GOING TO ACCEPT DONATIONS FROM\nCORPORATIONS OR FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS DOESN'T MEAN\nANYTHING.

CLINTON HAVE A CHANCE TO CLARIFY\nTHIS BEFORE THE ELECTION? >> I THINK SHE'S GOING TO FULLY\nCOOPERATE AND SHE'S PLEASED IT COULD BE DONE BY QUESTIONING\nRATHER THAN LIVE QUESTIONING. SO THIS HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE.\nMR. COMEY HAS ALREADY MADE HIS FINDINGS THAT THERE'S NO\nCRIMINAL INVOLVEMENT HERE. THREE FORMER SECRETARIES OF\nSTATE USED PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVERS.\n>> THEY DID NOT USE PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVERS.\nTHERE'S QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER THEY USE PRIVATE E-MAIL ACCOUNTS\nLIKE GMAIL OR SOMETHING ELSE BUT THEY DID SO ONLY SECURE PURPOSES\nBUT NEVER WITH THEIR OWN SERVERS.\n>> WELL, IT IS. BUT THEY ALSO INDICATE THAT\nTHERE'S SUPPOSEDLY SENSITIVE INFORMATION BY FORMER\nSECRETARIES OF STATE THAT WERE USED IN THAT CONTEXT.\nSO THIS IS NOT UNIQUE. AND QUITE FRANKLY, SENATOR\nCORKER AND I WANT TO LOOK AT THIS AFTER THE ELECTION TO SEE\nTHE BEST WAY WE CAN USE ELECTRONIC TRANSFER OF\nINFORMATION BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT.\nTHIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO DEAL WITH.\nBUT AS FAR AS WHAT'S BEING DONE NOW, LOOK, THIS LAWSUIT IS BEING\nDONE BY A GROUP THAT SINCE THE 1990s HAS BEEN A RIGHT WING\nPARTISAN GROUP ATTACKING HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHIS IS A PARTISAN ATTACK. AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT'S USED\nTO TRY TO DISTRACT FROM THE IMPORTANT ISSUES OF THIS\nCAMPAIGN, THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY\nCLINTON. >> AND THEY HAVE, JUDICIAL\nWATCH, MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THEY ARE VERY DOGGED ABOUT GOING\nAFTER THESE E-MAILS. IN THE MEANTIME, THE GOP LEADERS\nOF THE HOUSE JUDICIARY AND OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES ARE PUSHING\nFOR A PERJURY INVESTIGATION TAKING DIRECTOR COMEY'S -- HIS\nOWN STATEMENTS AND PUTTING THEM UP AGAINST MRS. CLINTON'S\nSTATEMENTS SAYING THERE ARE SOME DISCREPANCIES THERE.\nTHEY'VE ASKED THE U.S. ATTORNEY THERE IN WASHINGTON TO TAKE A\nLOOK AT THAT. DO YOU THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\nCAN BE CONVINCED THERE WILL BE AN OPEN AND TRANSPARENT\nPOTENTIAL INVESTIGATION INTO THAT ISSUE?\n>> LOOK, I THINK WHAT IS BEING REQUESTED BY MY CONGRESSIONAL\nCOLLEAGUES IS STRICTLY A PARTISAN WITCH HUNT.\nI WISH THEY SHOWED THE SAME DEGREE OF INTEREST IN PAUL\nMANAFORT'S CONNECTIONS TO RUSSIA AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN REGARDS\nTO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND THE BUSINESS DEALS THAT DONALD TRUMP\nHAS HAD IN RUSSIA. IT WOULD BE NICE TO SEE THAT\nTHEY HAD SOME INTEREST AS TO WHAT RUSSIA'S INVOLVEMENT IS IN\nOUR CAMPAIGN, BUT INSTEAD THEY CONTINUE TO GO AFTER THE E-MAIL\nISSUE EVEN THOUGH, AS I SAID, FBI DIRECTOR COMEY HAS INDICATED\nTHAT THAT CASE IS CLOSED. >> HE HAS.\nTHERE WILL BE NO CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.\nHE DID RAISE A NUMBER OF CONCERNS THERE ABOUT EXTREME\nCARELESSNESS AND THE HANDLING OF CLASSIFIED MATERIAL.\nIN THE MEANTIME, WE HAD THIS POLL FROM ABC NEWS, \"WASHINGTON\nPOST,\" ABOUT WHETHER MRS. CLINTON IS HONEST AND\nTRUSTWORTHY. 38% BELIEVE SHE IS, 5 DT 9% SAY\nSHE'S NOT. >> I DON'T KNOW.\nSHE'S QUALIFIED AND SHE'S READY. AS COMPARED TO DONALD TRUMP WHO\nHAS SHOWN HIS RECKLESSNESS AND DANGEROUS STATEMENTS THAT HE'S\nMADE. HIS TEMPERAMENT TO BE COMMANDER\nIN CHIEF, HIS QUALIFICATIONS, NO, IT'S NOT THIS.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS\nBEEN ABUZZ BY SPECIAL INTEREST. AND THE CLINTON FOUNDATION WILL\nNO LONGER ACCEPT FOREIGN MONEY. THE BOSTON GLOBE SAID IT SHOW BE\nSHUT DOWN ALTOGETHER. IT CREATES A VIEW OF POTENTIAL\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST. THE INHERENT CONFLICT OF\nINTEREST IS OBVIOUS WHEN HILLARY CLINTON BECAME SECRETARY OF\nSTATE IN 2009. SHE PROMISED TO MAINTAIN A\nSEPARATION BETWEEN HER OFFICIAL WORK AND THE FOUNDATION BUT\nRECENTLY RELEASED E-MAILS BY HER STAFFERS DURING HER STATE\nDEPARTMENT TENURE MAKE CLEAR THAT THE SUPPOSED PARTITION WAS\nFAR FROM IMPREGNABLE. IF THE FOUNDATION DONORS ARE\nMOTIVATED BY ALTRUISM AND NOT BY THE LURE OF ACCESS TO THE\nCLINTONS, THEN SURELY THEY CAN FIND OTHER WAYS TO SUPPORT THE\nFOUNDATION'S GOALS. >> THE CLINTON FOUNDATION HAS\nHELPED OVER 10 MILLION HIV/AIDS ALONE, SAVED COUNTLESS LIVES.\nITS WORK IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO GLOBAL HEALTH.\nSO THEY'VE DONE SOME REALLY GREAT THINGS.\nNOW, WITH HILLARY CLINTON BEING ELECTED PRESIDENT, WHICH WE HOPE\nIT WILL BE, THEY CLEARLY NEED TO CHANGE THE WAY THEY DO BUSINESS.\nAND THEY'VE INDICATED THEY WILL. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO ACCEPT ANY\nDONATIONS FROM FOREIGN ENTITIES. THEY'RE GOING TO CHANGE THE WAY\nTHAT THE CLINTONS THEMSELVES INTERACT WITH THE FOUNDATION.\nTHOSE DECISIONS WILL BE MADE APPROPRIATE TO HILLARY CLINTON\nAS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\n>> AND WE WILL WATCH. BY THE WAY, YOU MENTION THE\nHEALTH BENEFITS AND THINGS THEY'VE WORKED ON.\nTHE CLINTON HEALTH ACCESS INITIATIVE APPARENTLY IS A PART\nOF THE FOUNDATION BUT SAYING IT'S NOT YET MADE ITS OWN\nDECISION ABOUT WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO, THAT AND ITS DONATIONS\nMAY CONTINUE AS WELL. THIS WEEK HE MADE SOME APPEALS\nTO THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY.\nI WANT TO PLAY WHAT HE SAID TUESDAY IN WISCONSIN.\n>> THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY HAS BEEN TAKEN FOR\nGRANTED FOR DECADES BY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.\nWE REJECT THE BIGOTRY OF HILLARY CLINTON, WHICH PANDERS TO AND\nTALKS DOWN TO COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND SEES THEM ONLY AS\nVOTES. >> HE TALKED ABOUT CRIME RATES\nIN MINORITY NEIGHBORHOODS, FAILING EDUCATION, HIGH\nUNEMPLOYMENT. DOES HE HAVE A POINT?\n>> NO. THERE'S A CLEAR DIFFERENCE\nBETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON ON THEIR ECONOMIC\nMETHODS WHICH IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO THE\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN MINORITY COMMUNITIES AND THAT IS HILLARY\nCLINTON'S PROGRAM WILL HELP ALL. SHE WANTS TO INVEST IN BUILDING\nOUR INFRASTRUCTURE, BUILD OUR ROADS, BUILD OUR ENERGY\nINFRAINSTRUCT. SHE WANTS TO INVEST IN PEOPLE\nTHAT FREE HIGHER EDUCATION SO ALL OF US CAN GROW.\nSHEN A RESPONSIBLE WAY BY ASKING THOSE WHO ARE\nTAKING JOBS AWAY FROM AMERICA TO PAY AN EXIT FEE AS WELL AS\nCLOSING LOOPHOLES. DONALD TRUMP IS WIDENING\nLOOPHOLES FOR THE WEALTHIEST IN THE NATION.\nTHERE'S NO COMPARISON AS TO WHICH CANDIDATE SPEAKS TO THE\nNEEDS OF THE MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES.\n>> WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THEIR ECONOMIC PLAN COMING\nUP. BUT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT\nFOREIGN POLICY. YOU'RE THE RANKING MEMBER ON THE\nSENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE.\nYOU WERE VOCALLY AND PUBLICLY OPPOSED TO THE IRAN DEAL.\nYOU FELT THERE WERE FLAWS THERE THAT YOU COULDN'T SUPPORT.\nTHERE IS NEW FALLOUT ABOUT THAT $400 MILLION PAYMENT THAT WAS\nCONVERTED INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY, GIVEN TO THE IRANIANS.\nTHIS WEEK THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS ADMITTING THAT THERE WAS SOME\nDIRECT CONNECTION WITH THE RELEASE OF AMERICANS BEING HELD\nIN IRAN ABOUT THAT. I WANT TO PLAY WHAT PRESIDENT\nOBAMA SAID AUGUST 4th AND THEN WHAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS\nSAYING THIS WEEK. >> WE DO NOT PAY RANSOM.\nWE DIDN'T HERE AND WE WON'T IN THE FUTURE PRECISELY BECAUSE IF\nWE DID, THEN WE WOULD START ENCOURAGING AMERICANS TO BE\nTARGETED. >> IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FOOLISH\nAND PRUDENT, IRRESPONSIBLE FOR ITS TO NOT MAINTAIN MAXIMUM\nLEVERAGE. SO IF YOU'RE ASKING ME WAS THERE\nA CONNECTION IN THAT REGARD AT THE ENDGAME, I'M NOT GOING TO\nDENY THAT. >> TO A LOT OF PEOPLE IT SOUNDS\nLIKE A RANSOM PAYMENT. BUT WAS IT?\n>> THIS WAS DONE AND ANNOUNCED IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR.\nSECRETARY CLINTON WAS NO LONGER SECRETARY OF STATE.\nTHIS IS UNDER SECRETARY KERRY. CLEARLY WHAT WAS DONE HERE IS WE\nPAID MONEY THAT WE OWED. WE HAD TO PAY THIS MONEY, IT WAS\nCLEAR. TO THE EXTENT THAT IT HAD\nANYTHING TO DO WITH HOSTAGES, SECRETARY KERRY MADE IT CLEAR\nTHAT THAT MONEY WOULD NOT BE RELEASED UNLESS OUR HOSTAGES\nWERE BACK HOME. NO, IT'S NOT PAYING RANSOM.\nWE WON'T DO THAT. WE UNDERSTAND WE OWED THE MONEY\nAND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY THE MONEY, BUT WE WANT TO MAKE\nSURE THAT OUR PEOPLE ARE PROTECTED.\n>> A TOP IRANIAN GENERAL SAID THIS MONEY WAS RETURNED FOR THE\nFREEDOM OF THE U.S. SPIES AND IT WAS NOT RELATED TO THE NUCLEAR\nNEGOTIATIONS. SO IF THERE'S A PERCEPTION HERE,\nREGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANYONE WANTS TO USE THE WORD \"RANSOM\"\nOR NOT, THAT THERE'S LEVERAGE IN RELEASING THE AMERICANS AND\nGETTING THE EXCHANGE, ISN'T IT A PROBLEM BECAUSE WE'VE HAD TWO\nMORE AMERICANS TAKEN BY IRANIAN AUTHORITIES SINCE THIS PAYMENT.\n>> WHATEVER THE IRANIANS SAY, YOU CAN BELIEVE JUST ABOUT\nOPPOSITE. THEY RARELY TELL US WHAT IS\nGOING ON. AMERICA HAS A VERY STRONG\nPOLICY. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS\nCARRIED OUT THAT POLICY. NO, WE WILL NOT PAY RANSOM\nBECAUSE THAT ONLY ENCOURAGES MORE TO BE TAKEN.\nSO I AGREE WITH THAT POINT. WE ARE NOT GOING TO PAY RANSOM.\nHERE WE HAD TO MAKE THIS PAYMENT.\nIT WAS A MATTER OF WHEN WE WERE GOING TO MAKE IT.\nIT WAS BEING LITIGATED IN INTERNATIONAL COURTS, MONEY THAT\nAMERICA OWED THAT PREDATES THIS IRANIAN ADMINISTRATION.\nIT WAS GOING TO HAVE TO BE PAID AND THE ADMINISTRATION MADE\nJUDGMENTS AS TO WHEN TO PAY IT. >> YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE\nPERCEPTION CAN CAUSE A PROBLEM. >> I UNDERSTAND PERCEPTION, BUT\nI UNDERSTAND IN THAT WAS WELL UNDERSTOOD AT THE TIME IN\nJANUARY. HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HILLARY\nCLINTON. SHE WAS NOT SECRETARY OF STATE\nAT THE TIME. >> NOT ASKING IN THAT CONTEXT,\nBUT JUST ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION.\nI WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT SYRIA BECAUSE THE PICTURES THE AND\nIMAGES OF THE LITTLE BOY, THE 5-YEAR-OLD BEING TAKEN OUT OF\nTHE RUBBLE AFTER THIS AIR STRIKE HIT HIS FAMILY.\nWE FOUND OUT HIS 10-YEAR-OLD BROTHER WOUND UP DIEING FROM\nTHAT AIR STRIKE. THIS CAME AFTER PRESIDENT OBAMA\nSAID IT IS TIME FOR BASHAR AL SAD STEP ASIDE.\nFIVE YEARS LATER WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS, BY ALL\nACCOUNTS, WHO ARE DEAD, WHY IS THIS EVEN WORSE THAN BEFORE, THE\nCHAOS IN SYRIA? >> PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT\nRUSSIA IS HELPING THE SYRIAN REGIME.\nTHE SYRIAN REGIME HAS COMMITTED APROSTIES.\nWE SEE THAT IN ALEPPO AND OTHER PARTS OF SYRIA.\nTHEN WE HAVE, OF COURSE, THE ISIL FORCES THAT ARE ALSO\nCAUSING THESE PROBLEMS. >> WHAT COULD WE HAVE BEEN DOING\nBETTER? >> WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS WORK\nWITH OUR INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS. THAT'S WHAT THE OBAMA\nADMINISTRATION HAS DONE. WE CAN'T POLICE THE WORLD.\nIF WE PUT OUR TROOPS THERE IT WILL BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.\nWE KNOW THAT. WE HAVE TO BUILD UP LOCAL\nCAPACITY. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE OBAMA\nADMINISTRATION HAS DONE. WE'RE REGAINING TERRITORY AT THE\nSAME TIME BUILDING THE LOCAL CAPACITY TO HOLD THAT TERRITORY.\nAND THAT WE HAVE DONE. WE HAVE TO CONTINUOUSLY DO THAT\nUNTIL THERE IS NO LONGER AN ISIS AND THE CALIPHATE IS OVER.\n>> WE ALL LOOK FORWARD TO THAT DAY.\nSENATOR BEN CARDIN, THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK.\nGOOD TO HAVE YOU ON FOX NEWS",

THE DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN\nPUSHING BACK TONIGHT AGAINST REPORTS THAT WE ARE ABOUT TO\nPOSSIBLY SEE A MAJOR SHIFT IN POLICY FROM THE CANDIDATE WHO\nLAUNCHED HIS CAMPAIGN BY PROMISING TO BUILD A WALL WITH\nMEXICO. AND THEN DEPORT MILLIONS OF\nUNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. THE RUMORS THAT TRUMP MAY\nBACKTRACK AND FIND A WAY TO LEGALIZE MANY OF THOSE\nUNDOCUMENTED WORKERS STEMMING FROM A MEETING TRUMP HELD WITH\nHISPANIC SUPPORTERS IN NEW YORK ON SATURDAY.\nHERE'S WHAT HIS CAMPAIGN MANAGER KELLYANNE CONWAY TOLD CNN TODAY.\n>> SO WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAID YESTERDAY IN THAT MEETING\nDIFFERED VERY LITTLE FROM WHAT HE'S SAID PUBLICLY, DANA,\nINCLUDING HIS CONVENTION SPEECH LAST MONTH IN CLEVELAND.\nIT'S THAT WE NEED A, QUOTE, FAIR AND HUMANE WAY OF DEALING WITH\nWHAT IS EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT 11 MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN\nTHIS COUNTRY. NOTHING WAS SAID YESTERDAY THAT\nDIFFERS FROM WHAT MR. TRUMP HAS SAID YESTERDAY.\n>> LET ME PLAY SOMETHING FROM WHAT MR. TRUMP WAS SAID\nPREVIOUSLY. LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID BACK IN\nNOVEMBER. >> WE'LL HAVE A DEPORTATION\nFORCE. YOU'LL DO IT HUMANELY.\n>> WILL THEY GET RIPPED OUT OF THEIR HOMES?\nHOW. >> IF THEY CAME FROM A CERTAIN\nCOUNTRY, THEY'LL BE SENT BACK TO THAT COUNTRY.\nTHAT'S THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.\n>> DOES DONALD TRUMP STILL SUPPORT THAT, A DEPORTATION\nFORCE REMOVING THE 11 MILLION OR SO UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS?\n>> WHAT HE SUPPORTS -- AND IF YOU GO BACK TO THE CONVENTION\nSPEECH A MONTH AGO, DANA, WHAT HE SAID IS THAT WE ENFORCE THE\nLAW, THAT WE'RE RESPECTFUL OF THOSE AMERICANS WHO ARE LOOKING\nFOR WELL-PAYING JOBS AND THAT WE'RE FAIR AND HUMANE FOR THOSE\nWHO LIVE AMONG US IN THIS COUNTRY.\nAS THE WEEKS UNFOLD -- AS THE WEEKS UNFOLD HE'LL LAY OUT THE\nSPECIFICS OF THAT PLAN THAT HE WOULD IMPLEMENT AS PRESIDENT OF\nTHE UNITED STATES. >> WO THAT INCLUDE A DEPORTATION\nFORCE, THE KIND HE TALKED ABOUT THIS THAT SOUND BITE AND DURING\nTHE REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES? >> TO BE DETERMINED.\n>> WHILE TRUMP'S FUTURE SUPPORT OF A DEPORTATION FORCE REMAINED\nTBD, WE DID LEARN MORE ABOUT HIS CAMPAIGN WAR CHEST.\nBRAND-NEW DOCUMENTS FILED WITH THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMITTEE\nFOUND THAT TRUMP ENDED JULY WITH $38 MILLION ON HAND FOR HIS\nCAMPAIGN COMPARED WITH HILLARY CLINTON'S $58 MILLION.\nTODAY TRUMP HAS SPENT $89 MILLION ON THIS RUN FOR THE\nWHITE HOUSE. THAT'S A FRACTION OF THE 268\nMILLION THAT'S BEEN SPENT BY CLINTON.\nA LOT TO DISSECT THIS HOUR. JOINING ME IS OUR PANEL, AMY\nKRAMER AND A. SCOTT BOLDEN IS THE FORMER CHAM OF THE\nWASHINGTON, D.C., DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND A HILLARY CLINTON\nSUPPORTER. THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE.\n>> GOOD EVENING. >> GOOD EVENING TO YOU BOTH.\nAMY, TBD, THAT'S WHAT KELLYANNE CONWAY SAID BUT ALSO THE TRUMP\nCAMP IS SAYING HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING NEW IN THE MEETING WITH\nHISPANIC SUPPORTERS THAT HE HASN'T SAID BEFORE.\nEITHER WAY IT'S CONFUSING. DOES DONALD TRUMP HAVE TO DO A\nBETTER JOB OF EXPLAINING WHERE HE IS ON THIS ISSUE?\n>> I BELIEVE HE'S GOING TO COME OUT WITH AN IMMIGRATION POLICY\nFROM THE REPORTS I'VE HEARD THIS WEEKEND, HE EXPECTS TO COME OUT\nWITH SOMETHING LATER THIS WEEK. AND SO I WOULD WAIT AND DECIDE\nWHAT I THINK ABOUT IT UNTIL, YOU KNOW, HE PUTS OUT WHAT HIS PLAN\nIS. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE NEEDS\nTO DO. HE NEEDS TO TALK TO THE AMERICAN\nPEOPLE ABOUT IT. >> SO HE'S LAGGING IN THE POLLS\nAMONG MINORITIES, RIGHT? WHETHER THE FOX NEWS POLL THAT\nSHOWS HIM 46 POINTS BEHIND CLINTON WHEN IT COMES TO LATINO\nVOTERS IN THIS COUNTRY, WHETHER IT'S THE NBC/\"WALL STREET\nJOURNAL\" POLL THIS SHOWS HIM AT 1% SUPPORT AMONG\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS. WOULD IT BEHOOVE HIM TO ALTER\nHIS DEPORTATION POLICY A BIT TO SAY, I AM GOING TO WORK ON A WAY\nOR A PATH TOWARDS LEGALIZATION FOR SOME OF THESE 11 MILLION\nUNDOCUMENTED WORKERS IN THIS COUNTRY, EVEN IF IT'S NOT\nSOMETHING YOU AGREE WITH, WOULD IT HELP HIM IN THE POLLS?\n>> I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THAT, POPPY.\nI THINK THAT THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT DONALD TRUMP STANDS FIRM\nON HIS POSITIONS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT, YOU\nKNOW, GALVANIZED PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY IS THAT THEY'RE\nCONCERNED ABOUT OUR ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION SITUATION.\nAND THEY WANT IT TO BE DEALT WITH.\nAND THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT DEALT WITH IT IN THE WAY THAT\nPEOPLE WANT IT TO BE DEALT WITH. WE WANT OUR BORDERS SECURE.\nIT'S ESSENTIAL TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY.\n>> TO BE CLEAR, FACT CHECKING, THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS\nSEEN THE DEPORTATION OF A NUMBER OF UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS IN THIS\nCOUNTRY SO MUCH SO THAT THE CIVIL RIGHTS COMMITTEE HAS\nDUBBED PRESIDENT OBAMA DEPORTER IN CHIEF.\nIF WE DO SEE A SOFTENING OF TRUMP'S STANCE ON HOW TO HANDLE\nTHE 11 MILLION PLUS UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS IN THIS COUNTRY, DOES\nTHAT MAKE HILLARY CLINTON MORE VULNERABLE ON THIS ISSUE?\nBECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING SHE'S BEEN HAMMERING HIM AT.\nIF HE CHANGES HIS TUNE, DOES IT MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR HER?\n>> JUST BECAUSE HE CHANGES HIS TUNE DOESN'T MEAN HE'S GOING TO\nDO IT. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND\nEXACTLY WHAT HE BELIEVES IN AND WHAT HE DOESN'T.\nI WILL SAY THIS, IT IS HUGE THAT HIS CAMPAIGN MANAGER, HUGE, WAS\nGIVEN TWO OR THREE OPPORTUNITIES TO SAY HE WOULD DO FORCED\nDEPORTATION AND BUILD THE MEXICAN WALL AND SHE REFUSED TO\nDO IT. SHE SAID TBD.\n>> THE QUESTION WASN'T ABOUT THE WALL.\nHE ALWAYS SAID HE'S GOING TO BUILD A WALL.\n>> THE FORCED DEPORTATION. IT'S HUGE.\nIT WAS ESSENTIAL TO HIS MESSAGE IN THE PRIMARY.\nTHIS WOULDN'T BE A PIVOT. THIS WOULD BE A REVERSAL.\nTHEN HE HAS TO FACE CREDIBILITY ISSUES.\nDOES HE HAVE CREDIBILITY NOW IF HE DOESN'T GO FORWARD WITH THE\nFORCED DEPORTATION WITH THE PEOPLE THAT SUPPORTED HIM OR\nDOES HE TRY TO GET AT BLACKS AND BROWNS AND WHITE EDUCATED\nVOTERS? I THINK THE MESSAGE HAS BEEN\nCLEAR. I THINK THAT THE DIE HAS BEEN\nCAST. I THINK IT'S TOO LATE TO GET\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS AND HISPANICS AND EDUCATED WHITES BACK INTO\nTHE FOLD. THE DIE HAS BEEN CAST.\nSO IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT HE SAYS.\nIT DOESN'T MATTER IF HE SOFTENS HIS POSITION.\n>> YOU'RE SAYING THE DIE HAS BEEN CAST WHEN YOUR CANDIDATE IS\nWAY UP IN THE POLLS IN THE BATTLEGROUND STATES, BUT WE KNOW\nWE'VE GOT 80 DAYS TO GO. WE'LL SEE A LOT MORE AMERICANS\nPAYING VERY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THIS ELECTION AFTER LABOR DAY.\nSO AMY, TO YOU, THOUGH, ON THOSE NUMBERS, IT IS CLEAR THAT DONALD\nTRUMP HAS TO WIN OVER MORE MINORITY VOTERS AND HAS TO GET\nMORE WOMEN ON BOARD IF HE WANTS TO WIN THE WHITE HOUSE.\n>> RIGHT. >> AS HE PREPARES FOR THE DEBATE\nTHIS WEEKEND, WE KNOW HE STARTED THAT PREP THIS WEEKEND, WHAT DO\nYOU WANT TO HEAR HIM SAY ON THE DEBATE STAGE SEPTEMBER 26th TO\nDO THAT? >> I WANT HIM TO TALK ABOUT THE\nPOLICIES AND HIS SOLUTIONS THAT HE'S GOING TO IMPLEMENT IN ORDER\nTO GET OUR ECONOMY GOING AGAIN, TO CREATE JOBS AND TO SECURE OUR\nBORDERS AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE SAFE AS A NATION.\n>> BUT HE'S BEEN DOING THAT, AMY.\nWHAT DIFFERENT THINGS DO YOU WANT TO HEAR?\n>> IMMIGRATION POLICY IS A BIG THING.\nTHAT'S ABOUT OUR NATIONAL SECURITY AND SECURING THE\nBORDERS. THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT I WANT\nTO HEAR. I WANT HIM TO REACH OUT AND\nAPPEAL TO THESE PEOPLE AND TALK ABOUT WHY HE IS GOING TO BE A\nBETTER PRESIDENT THAN BARACK OBAMA OR HILLARY CLINTON WOULD\nBE BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON WILL BE FOUR MORE YEARS OF THE SAME\nOF THIS ADMINISTRATION THAT WE'VE HAD THE PAST EIGHT YEARS.\nAND THAT'S WHAT DONALD TRUMP NEEDS TO ARTICULATE.\nAND I THINK THAT'S WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN\nTRAIL. HE IS OUT THERE, HE'S HELD 24\nEVENTS ALREADY THIS MONTH. AND HE'S CONTINUING TO MEET WITH\nPEOPLE. AS WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE, HE'S\nDOWN IN MISSISSIPPI AND TEXAS REACHING OUT TO PEOPLE.\nTHOSE ARE NOT BATTLEGROUND STATES.\n>> WHY IS HE THERE? WHY IS HE THERE?\nPEOPLE SCRATCHED THEIR HEADS WHEN HE WENT TO CONNECTICUT LAST\nWEEK BECAUSE IT'S SO SOLIDLY BLUE.\nWHY SPEND MONEY DOWN IN, YOU KNOW, IN TEXAS AND MISSISSIPPI?\n>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, BECAUSE NUMBER ONE, THERE'S A LARGE\nHISPANIC AND LATINO POPULATION IN TEXAS.\nWHY NOT REACH OUT TO THEM? SECOND OF ALL, BECAUSE IT'S NO\nSECRET THAT THERE'S BEEN A PROBLEM WITH THE REPUBLICAN\nPARTY AS WELL AS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.\nHE'S TRYING TO BRING THE REPUBLICAN BASE TOGETHER, REACH\nOUT PROBABLY TO SOME OF THOSE TED CRUZ SUPPORTERS, THE\nNEVER-TRUMPERS OUT THERE. AND LOOK, I THINK TED CRUZ\nSAID -- DID EXACTLY WHAT HE DIDN'T INTEND TO DO.\nHE UNIFIED PEOPLE AT THE CONVENTION WHEN HE GOT UP ON\nTHAT CONVENTION STAGE AND DIDN'T ENDORSE DONALD TRUMP.\nBUT TRUMP IS GOING TO TEXAS AND I'M SURE HE'S TRYING TO REACH\nOUT TO THOSE PEOPLE. THERE'S NO PLACE THAT THESE\nCANDIDATES SHOW NOT GO, POPPY. >> SWITCHING GEARS HERE, SCOTT,\nI GOT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THIS WEEK WE LEARNED AT\nTHE END OF THE WEEK THAT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION WILL STOP\nTAKING MONEY FROM FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND FROM\nCORPORATIONS IF HILLARY CLINTON IS ELECTED PRESIDENT AND THAT\nBILL CLINTON WILL NOT GIVE PAID SPEECHES.\nHE HASN'T DONE SO SINCE 2015. BUT TODAY ON \"STATE OF THE\nUNION\" OUR DANA BASH PRESSED CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER ROBBY\nMOOK ON THIS POINT, ON THE DECISION TO NOT STOP THAT\nDONATION FROM FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS NOW OR WHILE SHE WAS\nSECRETARY OF STATE. WHY WAIT UNTIL SHE'S PRESIDENT\nIF SHE WINS. LISTEN.\n>> BUT IF THIS IS THE RIGHT POLICY NOW, WHY NOT DO IT WHEN\nSHE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT? >> THE FOUNDATION IS DOING AN\nENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WORK AND IT TAKES TIME WHEN YOU'RE IN A\nNUMBER OF COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD TO RETOOL, REFOCUS THE\nMISSION AND ADAPT. AS YOU SAID, THEY RECEIVE A\nGREAT DEAL OF FUNDING THROUGH THESE STREAMS",

THOSE ARE STATES THAT SHOULD BE\nIN THE BAG FOR THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES.\nTHEY HAVE NOT BEEN BLUE FOR MANY YEARS.\nTHANK YOU, LADY, FOR BEING HERE. SALLY, I'M GOING TO BEGIN WITH\nYOU. WE JUST GOT THIS STATEMENT FROM\nTHE CLINTON CAMP, AND THEY SAID THEY DO NOT BELIEVE DONALD TRUMP\nHAS CHANGED HIS POSITION ON DEPORTING ALL OF THE ILLEGAL\nUNDOCUMENTED WORKERS IN THIS COUNTRY AT ALL.\nTHEY SAY WE BELIEVE THAT HAS NOT CHANGED.\nBUT LET ME PAUSE AT THIS. LET ME ASK YOU THIS.\nIF IT HAS CHANGED, AS MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS ACCORDING TO UNAVISION\nSAY FROM THAT MEETING YESTERDAY, DOES THAT COMPLICATE THINGS FOR\nCLINTON? DOES THAT MAKE IT HARDER IF HE\nCHANGES HIS HARD LINE STANCE ON THAT?\n>> I'M GOING TO BE HONEST, I DON'T REALLY CARE WHAT IT DOES\nFOR HILLARY CLINTON. THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE\nCOUNTRY IF DONALD TRUMP CHANGED HIS STANCE ON THAT.\nYOU KNOW, IT IS DEEPLY PROBLEMATIC WHEN HE PLAYS INTO\nTHE, YOU KNOW, HARSH CRACKDOWN, ANTI-IMMIGRANT DREAMS OF\nIMMIGRANTS WHO CAME HERE LIKE MY ANCE\nANCESTORS, LIKE MANY OF OUR ANCESTORS, AND SUGGEST THERE\nSHOULD BE A DEPORTATION FORCE THAT GOES INTO CHURCHES, GOES\nINTO HOMES, GOES INTO SCHOOLS AND ROUNDS THEM UP AND KICKS\nTHEM OUT OF THE COUNTRY. FORGET THE POLITICS IN THIS.\nI SINCERELY HOPE HE CHANGES WHAT IS A VERY IMMORAL AND UNLIKELY\nPOSITION. I WELCOME THAT.\n>> HE SAID BEFORE WE HAVE TO FOLLOW THE LAWS AND WE HAVE TO\nDEPORT THEM, HE HAS TALKED ABOUT DOING IT IN A HUMANE WAY.\nBUT TO YOU, DO YOU THINK PERHAPS GIVEN THE STRUGGLES THAT DONALD\nTRUMP HAS WITH THE MINORITY VOTERS -- IN THE LATEST FOX POLL\nHE'S DOWN 46% AMONG HISPANIC VOTERS AND HE IS PULLING 1% WITH\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS IN THE LATEST WALL STREET JOURNAL POLL,\nWOULD IT BEHOOVE HIM TO CHANGE HIS HARD LINE STANCE ON\nDEPORTING THOSE 11 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS?\n>> POPPY, I'M SORRY, BUT I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANYTHING HARD\nLINE ABOUT UP HOLDING THE CONSTITUTION AND FOLLOWING THE\nRULE OF LAW. THAT'S WHAT WE WANT.\nTHAT'S WHAT AMERICANS WANT, AND THAT IS WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS\nPROPOSING. HE'S NOT SAYING STOP ALL\nIMMIGRATION. WHAT HE WANTS IS PEOPLE TO COME\nHERE LEGALLY. THESE PEOPLE THAT COME HERE AND\nCROSS THE BORDER AND DON'T FOLLOW THE LAW, THEY'RE BREAKING\nOUR LAWS, AND IT'S NOT FAIR TO THE ONES THAT HAVE COME HERE AND\nDONE IT THE PROPER WAY. IT'S EXPENSIVE.\nTHEY PAY ATTORNEYS, THEY WAIT IN LINE FOR MANY YEARS TO COME HERE\nLEGALLY. WHAT IS WRONG WITH FOLLOWING THE\nLAW? THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH\nTHAT. THAT'S NOT INHUMANE.\nI'M SORRY, SALLY, BUT IT'S JUST NOT.\n>> I'M SORRY, CAN I JUST SAY, FIRST OF ALL, WHEN MY ANCESTORS\nCAME, THERE WEREN'T IMMIGRATION LAWS.\nWE DIDN'T HAVE A LINE. WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY HAVE ANY\nCAPS, ANY QUOTAS, NUMBER ONE. THAT'S TRUE OF A LOT OF\nAMERICANS, SO THAT'S NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO, A LOT OF AMERICANS,\nA LOT OF IMMIGRANTS COME TO THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY'RE BEING\nACTIVELY LURED HERE AND RECRUITED BY AMERICAN\nBUSINESSES, BUT WE AREN'T TALKING ABOUT ROUNDING THEM UP\nAND DEPORTING THEM. AND THIRD, LET'S BE VERY CLEAR.\nIF YOU WANT TO HAVE MILITARY OR POLICE FORCES THAT GO INTO\nCHURCHES AND SCHOOLS AND HOMES AND WORKPLACES AND ROUND PEOPLE\nUP AND DEPORT 11 MILLION PEOPLE, YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT INTERMENT\nCAMPS, AND THERE IS NOTHING HUMANE ABOUT THAT.\nIT'S NOT JUST PEOPLE OF COLOR THAT ARE AFFECTED BY THIS, A LOT\nOF VOTERS, WOMEN VOTERS, BLACK VOTERS THAT ARE HORRIFIED.\n>> I WANT YOUR RESPONSE TO IT, BUT AMY, THE QUESTION I WAS\nASKING BEFORE IS NOT WHETHER OR NOT YOU AGREE WITH IT OR NOT,\nWHETHER OR NOT IT WOULD BEHOOVE DONALD TRUMP IN THE POLLS,\nWHETHER IT WOULD HELP HIM GAIN THE VOTER GROUPS THAT HE NEEDS\nIF HE WERE TO CHANGE HIS STANCE ON THIS.\n>> I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE SEEN IN THIS ELECTION IS\nTHAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC ARE SICK AND TIRED OF WASHINGTON,\nD.C. AND POLITICIANS THAT CHANGE THEIR POSITION ACCORDING TO\nWHICH WAY THE POLITICAL WIND IS BLOWING.\nAND THE REASON DONALD TRUMP GOT AROUND 14 MILLION VOTES DURING\nTHE PRIMARY IS BECAUSE HE STOOD FIRM ON WHAT HE BELIEVED IN, AND\nI THINK HE NEEDS TO DO THAT NOW. AT THE SAME TIME, I WILL SAY\nTHAT I MMIGRATION IS NOT AN EAS ISSUE.\nIF THERE WERE SOMETHING EASY TO FIX THIS PROBLEM, IT WOULD HAVE\nBEEN DONE LONG AGO. THE PRESIDENT COULD HAVE DONE IT\nDURING THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF HIS ADMINISTRATION WHEN HE HAD\nTHE CONGRESS AND THE SENATE. >> UNDER THE OBAMA\nADMINISTRATION, A NUMBER OF UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS HAVE BEEN\nDEPORTED, SO MUCH SO THAT HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS HAVE CALLED HIM\nDEPORTER IN CHIEF. >> THIS IS NOT AN EASY THING TO\nFIGURE OUT. SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT FIGURING\nOUT WHAT THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS, IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME\nTIME. I'M GLAD HE'S PUTTING TOGETHER A\nTEAM OF PEOPLE TO WORK ON THAT, AND I LOOK FORWARD TO, IF THE\nREPORTS ARE RIGHT, THAT HE'S GOING TO PUT OUT HIS IMMIGRATION\nPOLICIES LATER THIS WEEK. I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING ABOUT\nTHAT. >> LET'S MOVE FORWARD.\nSALLY, I WANT YOU TO WEIGH IN ON THIS.\nIT HAS BEEN CERTAINLY A DIFFERENT STYLE OF A WEEK FOR\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT\nHAS BEEN THE BEST WEEK HE'S HAD IN A WHILE.\nKELLYANNE CONWAY IS IN CHARGE RIGHT NOW.\nWHETHER YOU AGREE WITH HER POLITICS OR NOT, SHE HAS BEEN\nCREDITED WITH A LOT OF SUCCESS IN THE REPUBLICAN FIELD.\nNOW OUR DANA BASH IS REPORTING TONIGHT THAT SHAWN SPICER, CHIEF\nCOMMUNICATIONS OFFICER, WILL BE WORKING OUT OF THE TRUMP TOWER,\nPART-TIME, AT LEAST. IS THIS CAMPAIGN GETTING ON\nTRACK MORE OF A THREAT TO CLINTON?\n>> THE BAR CONTINUES TO BE SET LOWER AND LOWER FOR DONALD\nTRUMP. THIS IS HIS BEST WEEK YET ONLY\nBECAUSE IT'S HIS LEAST DISASTROUS WEEK YET.\nBUT, YOU KNOW, THAT'S LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, PRAISING SOMEONE WHO\nUSUALLY GETS IN A FIGHT EVERY WEEK IN SCHOOL FOR SUDDENLY,\nLIKE, HEY, YOU DIDN'T HIT ANYBODY THIS WEEK.\nGOOD JOB, KID. THE BAR NEEDS TO BE SET A LITTLE\nBIT HIGHER BOTH FOR HIS CAMPAIGN AND FOR HIS CANDIDACY.\nAGAIN, THIS IS SOMEONE WHO IS RUNNING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE\nLEADERSHIP, THE AUTHORITY OVER THE ENTIRE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT,\nOUR ARMED FORCES, NOT TO MENTION SINGULAR CONTROL OVER OUR\nNUCLEAR ARSENAL, AND HE CAN'T EVEN GET HIS CAMPAIGN IN ORDER.\nTHAT'S HOW DISORGANIZED HE IS AND LEADER HE IS.\nPEOPLE SHOULD BE REALLY DISCOURAGED.\n>> SALLY, HE ISN'T A POLITICIAN. HE'S NEVER RUN FOR OFFICE\nBEFORE. AND ACTUALLY, I THINK IT'S A\nGOOD THING WHEN SOMETHING IS NOT WORKING.\nA REAL LEADER STEPS IN AND SAYS, THIS IS NOT WORKING, WE'VE GOT\nTO CHANGE THINGS, AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE'S DONE.\nI THINK TO CONTINUE TO DO THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER HAS\nGOTTEN DIFFERENT RESULTS. >> WE KNOW HE'S GOING TO OHIO\nTHIS WEEK. THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE.\nBIG BATTLEGROUND STATES, GOING TO NEVADA, I GET THAT.\nWHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS GOING TO MISSISSIPPI AND GOING TO",

THAT WOULD BE A MAJOR DEPARTURE\nFROM THE BUILD A WALL DONALD TRUMP THAT WE'VE HEARD SO FAR.\nTRUMP'S CAMP TONIGHT PUSHING BACK SAYING THEIR CANDIDATE SAID\nNOTHING IN THE MEETING THAT HE HASN'T SAID BEFORE AND A\nSEPARATE TRUMP SUPPORTER AT THAT ROUNDTABLE TELLS CNN HE DIDN'T\nGET THE IMPRESSION THAT TRUMP WAS OPEN TO LEGALIZING\nUNDOCUMENTED WORKERS. HERE'S WHAT TRUMP'S NEW CAMPAIGN\nMANAGER, KELLYANNE CONWAY, SAID THIS MORNING.\n>> LET ME PLAY SOMETHING FROM WHAT MR. TRUMP HAS SAID\nPREVIOUSLY. LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID BACK IN\nNOVEMBER. >> YOU NEED TO HAVE A\nDEPORTATION FORCE. >> WILL THEY GET RIPPED OUT OF\nTHEIR HOMES? HOW?\n>> THEY'RE GOING BACK WHERE THEY CAME.\nIF THEY CAME FROM A CERTAIN COUNTRY, THEY'RE GOING TO BE\nBROUGHT BACK TO THAT COUNTRY. THAT'S THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO\nBE. >> DOES DONALD TRUMP STILL\nSUPPORT THAT? A DEPORTATION FORCE, REMOVING\nTHE 11 MILLION OR SO UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS?\n>> WHAT HE SUPPORTS, AND IF YOU GO BACK TO THE CONVENTION SPEECH\nA MONTH AGO, DANA, WHAT HE SUPPORTS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE\nFORCE THE LAW, THAT WE ARE RESPECTFUL OF THOSE AMERICANS\nWHO ARE LOOKING FOR WELL-PAYING JOBS AND THAT WE ARE FAIR AND\nHUMANE FOR THOSE WHO LIVE AMONG US IN THIS COUNTRY.\nAS THE WEEKS UNFOLD HE WILL LAY OUT THE SPECIFICS OF THE PLAN\nTHAT HE WILL IMHEMENT AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\n>> WILL THAT INCLUDE A DEPORTATION FORCE THAT YOU JUST\nHEARD OF IN THAT SOUND BITE AND THAT HE TALKED ABOUT DURING THE\nREPUBLICAN PRIMARIES? >> TO BE DETERMINED.\n>> SO COULD TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION STANCE BE DETERMINED THIS WEEK?\nHE WILL BE OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL IN A MAJOR WAY.\nHE IS SET TO HOLD RALLIES IN BATTLEGROUND STATES OF OHIO AND\nHE'LL BE IN NEVADA THIS WEEK. BUT HE'S ALSO GOING TO TEXAS AND\nMISSISSIPPI. THOSE ARE TWO STATES THAT SHOULD\nBE IN THE BAG FOR THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE.\nFRANKLY, MISSISSIPPI AND TEXAS HAVEN'T GONE BLUE SINCE 1976.\nJOINING ME NOW DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST HOLLY SCHULMAN.\nSHE SUPPORTS HILLARY CLINTON. AND ALSO WITH US AGAIN TONIGHT\nAMY KRAMER WHO SUPPORTS DONALD TRUMP.\nALL-WOMAN PANEL THIS EVENING. AMY, SINCE DAY ONE, SINCE WE SAW\nDONALD TRUMP COME DOWN THAT GOLD ESCALATOR AT TRUMP TOWER, HE'S\nBEEN RUNNING ON THIS PLATFORM OF IMMIGRATION, IMMIGRATION,\nIMMIGRATION REFORM, TALKING ABOUT BUILDING A WALL.\nNOW WE HEARD WHAT HIS CAMPAIGN MANAGER SAID TBD ON WHETHER\nHE'LL SOFTEN HIS POSITION. TWO MONTHS FROM THE ELECTION, IS\nIT UNCLEAR WHERE HE STANDS? >> I'M NOT CONCERNED ABOUT IT AT\nALL. I KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN LEAKS\nTHAT HAVE COME OUT OF THESE MEETINGS FROM PEOPLE IN\nATTENDANCE, BUT I WOULDN'T TAKE ANY OF THAT SERIOUSLY UNTIL IT\nCOMES OUT OF MR. TRUMP'S MOUTH. I THINK HE'S GOING TO BE HONEST\nWITH US. THAT'S ONE THING HE SAID LAST\nWEEK IN ONE OF HIS SPEECHES, I WILL ALWAYS TELL YOU THE TRUTH.\nSO I THINK THEY ARE WORKING ON THIS IMMIGRATION PLAN.\nHE KNOWS WHAT THE ISSUES ARE, HE KNOWS WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\nARE CONCERNED ABOUT. I THINK HE'LL COME OUT WITH A\nPLAN AND HE'S GOING TO TELL US EXACTLY WHAT HE INTENDS TO DO.\n>> LET ME ASK YOU ONE QUESTION ON THAT.\nBECAUSE IT'S BECOME VERY CLEAR IN THE LAST WEEK, CNN'S NEW\nBATTLEGROUND MAP SHOWS THIS, THAT EVEN IF HE WERE TO -- EVEN\nIF HILLARY CLINTON WERE TO LOSE EVERY BATTLEGROUND STATE, SHE\nSTILL HAS A PATH TO 173 ELECTORAL VOTES.\nIT'S STILL THAT HE NEEDS WORKING CLASS VOTERS.\nTHIS SCHOOL AT WHARTON AND WHAT IT FORECASTS IS HIS PLAN TO\nDEPORT 11 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS WOULD RESULT IN 4\nMILLION JOB LOSSES FOR THE U.S. ECONOMY BY 2030.\nDO YOU THINK THAT TRUMP IS LOOKING AT NUMBERS LIKE THIS,\nLOOKING AT THE POLLING, LOOKING AT THE REALITY OF THE MAP AND\nSAYING I MAY HAVE TO CHANGE WHAT I SAID BEFORE ON DEPORTING ALL\nOF THOSE IMMIGRANTS? >> WELL, POPPY, I'M NOT FAMILIAR\nWITH THAT EXACTLY STUDY THAT CAME OUT, BUT I KNOW THAT DONALD\nTRUMP IS CONCERNED ABOUT JOBS AND THE ECONOMY BUT HE'S ALSO\nCONCERNED ABOUT OUR SAFETY AND NATIONAL SECURITY AND ABOUT\nPEOPLE UPHOLDING THE LAW. AND WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT IS\nNOT IMMIGRATION, LEGAL IMMIGRANTS.\nWHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.\nJASON CHAFFETZ AND THE HOUSE OVERSITE COMMITTEE HAD A HEARING\nAND HE CITED OUT OF 86 MILLION IMMIGRANTS RELEASED BY ISIS,\nTHEY HAD BEEN CONVICTED OF CRIMES.\n231 CRIMES THAT THEY WERE CONVICTED OF.\nOF 196 OF THOSE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS THAT WERE RELEASED BY\nISIS, 196 OF THEM HAD COMMITTED HOMICIDE AND BEEN CONVICTED OF\nIT. AND THOSE ARE THINGS ALSO THAT\nDONALD TRUMP IS CONCERNED ABOUT. SO THAT'S PART OF BEING A\nCOMMANDER IN CHIEF IS YOU HAVE TO WEIGH THOSE THINGS OUT AND\nYOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A SOLUTION FOR ALL AMERICANS.\nBUT IT'S ABOUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\n>> HOLLY, TO YOU, LET ME BRING YOU IN HERE.\nA NEW CNN POLL THAT WAS TAKEN AEFR BOTH PARTIES' CONVENTIONS\nMORE THAN HALF OF VOTERS THINK THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS A\nBETTER HANDLE ON IMMIGRATION THAN DONALD TRUMP.\nBUT NOW IF TRUMP DOES CHANGE HIS TUNE, IF HE DOES SOFTEN IT, IF\nHE SAYS WE WON'T DEPORT THESE 11 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS,\nWE'LL FIND A PATH, BUT SOMETHING DIFFERENT, DOES THAT MAKE HIM\nMORE APPEALING TO VOTER WHO ARE UNDECIDED RIGHT NOW?\n>> IT DOESN'T MATTER. HE HAS NO SERIOUS PLAN ON\nIMMIGRATION, AS MY COLLEAGUE AMY SAID.\nIT'S STILL TO BE DETERMINED, AS KELLYANNE SAID THIS MORNING.\nWE'RE GOING INTO THE ELECTION WITH A CANDIDATE WHO HAS IMPLIED\nTHAT FOREIGNERS ARE DANGEROUS, WHO HAS IMPLIED THAT MEXICANS\nARE ALL RACISTS. >> HE DIDN'T SAY ALL.\nHE DID NOT SAY ALL. >> AND NOW HE'S PUSHING POLICIES\nTHAT REFLECT THAT VISION, WHETHER IT'S BUILDING A WALL,\nWHICH EVEN RICK PERRY SAYS IS UNREALISTIC.\nSO THAT'S WHERE WE ARE IN THIS ELECTION.\nWE KNOW WHERE DONALD TRUMP STANDS.\nHE'S MADE IT VERY CLEAR. ANYTHING HE DOES TO TRY TO\nCHANGE HIS MIND THIS WEEK I THINK IS ONE, DISINGENUOUS, AND\nSHOULD HAVE BEEN SAID IN PUBLIC AND NOT IN PRIVATE --\n>> WOULD YOU DISAGREE, HOLLY, THAT THIS HAS BEEN A RELATIVELY\nWITH GOOD WEEK FOR DONALD TRUMP COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS THREE\nWEEKS? >> I DON'T THINK THAT THIS HAS\nBEEN A PARTICULARLY GOOD WEEK FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nLIKE YOU SAID, HE'S SPENDING HIS TIME CAMPAIGNING IN TEXAS, IN\nMISSISSIPPI AND STATES THAT SHOULD BE IN THE BAG FOR HIM.\nHE'S THERE BECAUSE HE'S NERVOUS ABOUT THOSE STATES OR BECAUSE\nOTHER REPUBLICANS IN VULNERABLE STATES HAVE CAUSED HIM TO STAY\nAWAY. >> LET ME ASK AMY, WHY IS HE\nDOING THAT? OHIO MAKES SENSE, NEVADA I GET.\nWHY GO TO TEXAS AND MISSISSIPPI? KIND OF LIKE WHEN HE WENT TO\nCONNECTICUT, THIS SOLIDLY BLUE STATE.\nTEXAS AND MISSISSIPPI, THEY HAVEN'T GONE BLUE SINCE '76.\nWHY IS HE SPENDING TIME AND MONEY THERE?\n>> POPPY, I PERSONALLY BELIEVE HE SHOULD BE GOING EVERYWHERE.\nI BELIEVE ALL OF THOSE CANDIDATES -- BOTH OF THOSE\nCANDIDATES -- >> WHY IS THAT SMART CAMPAIGNING\nWHEN IT COMES DOWN TO THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE?\n>> OUT OF THE MONTH OF AUGUST HILLARY CLINTON'S ONLY HELD 11\nEVENTS ON HER SCHEDULE OUT OF THE ENTIRE MONTH OF AUGUST.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS SO FAR HELD 24. I DON'T SEE A PROBLEM WITH IT.\nI THINK HE SHOULD BE GOING THERE AND HE SHOULD BE GOING\nEVERYWHERE THAT HIS BASE AND VOTERS WANT TO HEAR FROM HIM.\nEVERY STATE SHOULD WANT TO HEAR FROM HIM.\nBUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE'S NOT FOCUSING ON THE SWING STATES.\nHE'S CERTAINLY FOCUSES ON THE SWING STATES.\nINSTEAD OF ACCEPTEDING HIS CUR SURROGATES EVERYWHERE.\nDT T IS REACHING OUT AND TRYING TO TOUCH EVERY SINGLE VOTER THAT\nHE POSSIBLY CAN.

            "text": ">>> HELLO.\nTHANKS FOR JOINING ME. I'M MARTIN SAVIDGE IN FOR\nFREDRICKA WHITFIELD. WE'LL BEGIN WITH WHAT IS A\nPOTENTIAL SEISMIC SHIFT FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nJUST DAYS BEFORE THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DELIVERS\nA MAJOR SPEECH ON IMMIGRATION, HIS CAMPAIGN IS SIGNALING THAT\nHE MAYBE SOFTENING HIS STANCE ON DEPORTING MILLIONS OF\nUNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. FORCED DEPORTATIONS WERE A MAJOR\nCORNERSTONE OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN BUT NOW THE ISSUE IS,\nQUOTE, TO BE DETERMINED. WE'LL TALK TO CHRIS FRATES IN\nJUST A MOMENT TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHY THIS SHIFT IS A\nCURING AT THIS TIME. IT WAS JUST RECENTLY THAT WE\nHEARD THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS REACHING OUT TO MINORITIES.\nNOW THIS IS A DIFFERENT SHIFT REACHING OUT TO IMMIGRANTS.\nTHE IMPACT IS YET TO BE SEEN. THERE'S CHRIS FRATES.\nCHRIS, WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT THIS REALLY SEISMIC SHIFT\nOR SO IT SOUNDS. WHAT ARE YOU HEARING?\n>> YEAH, WELL, MARTIN, AS YOU POINTED OUT HERE, DONALD TRUMP\nCAMPAIGNED HARD ON THIS PLAN TO DEPORT THE 11 MILLION IMMIGRANTS\nWHO ARE IN THIS COUNTRY ILLEGALLY.\nBUT TODAY KELLYANNE CONWAY SIGNALED TRUMP'S HARDLINE STANCE\nMIGHT BE SOFTENING. HERE'S DANA BASH PRESSING CONWAY\nTHIS MORNING ON \"STATE OF THE UNION.\"\n>> LET ME GET SOME CLARITY BECAUSE YOU WERE AT THIS\nMEETING. DOES DONALD TRUMP STILL SUPPORT\nSETTING UP A DEPORTATION FORCE AND REMOVING THE 11 MILLION OR\nESTIMATED 11 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS FROM\nAMERICA, YES OR NO? >> SO WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAID\nYESTERDAY IN THAT MEETING DIFFERED VERY LITTLE FROM WHAT\nHE SAID PUBLICLY INCLUDING HIS CONVENTION SPEECH LAST MONTH IN\nCLEVELAND. WE NEED A FAIR AND, QUOTE,\nHUMANE WAY OF DEALING WITH WHAT IS ESTIMATED TO BE 11 MILLION\nILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN THIS COUNTRY.\nTHAT WAS PART OF THE DISCUSSION, IT WAS A VERY ROBUST DISCUSSION.\nI'VE SEEN HIM VERY ANIMATED IN MEETINGS LIKE THIS WHERE HE'S\nLEARNING, HE'S TAKING NOTES, HE'S ASKING QUESTIONS, HE'S\nRECEIVING INFORMATION, AND THE REST OF THE CONVERSATION,\nFRANKLY, WAS ABOUT JOB CREATION, ECONOMIC REVITALIZATION, THE\nFACT THAT SMALL BUSINESS GROWTH AMONG HISPANIC AND LATINO\nAMERICANS IS ON THE RISE. WE TALKED ABOUT THE INABILITY TO\nGET ACCESS TO CAPITAL FOR MANY OF THEM, WE TALKED ABOUT HOME\nOWNERSHIP AND FAMILY AND RELIGION BEING VERY IMPORTANT TO\nHISPANICS. A VERY LONG, FAR REACHING\nCONVERSATION. BUT NOTHING WAS SAID YESTERDAY\nTHAT DIFFERS FROM WHAT MR. TRUMP HAS SAID PREVIOUSLY.\n>> LET ME PLAY SOMETHING FROM WHAT MR. TRUMP HAS SAID\nPREVIOUSLY. LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID BACK IN\nNOVEMBER. >> WE NEED TO HAVE A DEPORTATION\nFORCE. YOU'LL DO IT HUMANELY.\n>> WILL THEY BE RIPPED OUT OF THEIR HOMES?\nHOW? >> THEY'LL GO BACK TO A CERTAIN\nCOUNTRY. THAT'S THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO\nBE. >> DOES DONALD TRUMP STILL\nSUPPORT THAT, A DEPORTATION FORCE REMOVING THE 11 MILLION OR\nSO UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS? >> WHAT HE SUPPORTS -- AND IF\nYOU GO BACK TO THE CONVENTION SPEECH A MONTH AGO, DANA, WHAT\nHE SUPPORTS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ENFORCE THE LAW, THAT WE'RE\nRESPECTFUL OF THOSE AMERICANS WHO ARE LOOKING FOR WELL-PAYING\nJOBS AND THAT WE ARE FAIR AND HUMANE FOR THOSE WHO LIVE AMONG\nUS IN THIS COUNTRY. AS THE WEEKS UNFOLD, HE WILL LAY\nOUT THE SPECIFICS OF THAT PLAN THAT HE WOULD IMPLEMENT AS\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. >> WILL THAT PLAN INCLUDE A\nDEPORTATION FORCE, THE KIND THAT HE JUST -- YOU JUST HEARD IN\nTHAT SOUND BITE AND HE TALKED ABOUT DURING THE REPUBLICAN\nPRIMARIES? >> TO BE DETERMINED.\n>> QUESTIONS ABOUT TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION POSITIONS COME AFTER\nA MEETING WITH HISPANIC LEADERS ON SATURDAY WHERE HE REPORTEDLY\nTOLD ATTENDEES HE PLANS TO LEGALIZE MILLIONS OF\nUNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. THAT WOULD BE A HUGE REVERSAL\nFOR TRUMP WHO HAS CAMPAIGNED ON THE IDEA OF CREATING A\nDEPORTATION FORCE THAT WOULD EXPEL UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS\nFROM THE COUNTRY. NOT EVERYONE WHO ATTENDED THAT\nMEETING WALKED AWAY WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT TRUMP'S OPENLY\nGRANTING LEGAL STATUS TO UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS.\nONE MEETING ATTENDEST SAID THAT TRUMP TALKED ABOUT TREATING\nPEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY IN A HUMANE, FAIR AND LEGAL WAY\nBUT HE DIDN'T INTERPRET THAT THAT TRUMP MEANT HE WANTED TO\nGRANT THEM LEGAL STATUS. WE'LL LIKELY HEAR MORE DIRECTLY\nFROM TRUMP HIMSELF IN THE COMING DAYS.\n>> ONE OF THE THINGS IN THAT RESPONSE THERE, TO BE\nDETERMINED, IS AN ODD WAY TO PUT IT.\nYOU MIGHT SAY, TO BE REVEALED. AND TO SAY TO BE DETERMINED\nMEANS WE HAVEN'T FIGURED THAT OUT YET.\nTHAT ISN'T GOOD FOR A PERSON RUNNING FOR OFFICE.\n>> THIS IS STILL PART OF WHAT THE DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS\nPUTTING TOGETHER AND THAT MAYBE THERE WILL BE NEW PLANS UNVEILED\nTHIS WEEK. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WAITING TO\nSEE. CERTAINLY KELLYANNE CONWAY\nMAKING IT CLEAR HE'S STILL TALKING ABOUT HUMANE, FAIR AND\nLEGAL TREATMENT, BUT TO BE DETERMINED STILL LEAVES IT UP IN\nTHE AIR WHETHER TRUMP STILL SUPPORTS HIS DEPORTATION FORCE\nOR WHETHER HE WANTS TO GIVE THEM SOME PATH TO LEGALIZATION.\nFOLKS ON THE RIGHT MIGHT CALL THAT AMNESTY.\nTHIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'LL BE CONTINUING TO WATCH.\nBUT THE CAMPAIGN DOES TELL US THAT THIS WILL BE A WEEK THAT\nDONALD TRUMP WANTS TO FOCUS ON IMMIGRATION.\nWE EXPECT WE'LL HEAR MORE FROM HIM DIRECTLY LATER IN THE WEEK.\n>> WE MIGHT GET GREATER CLARIFICATION.\n>> WHAT CAUSED TRUMP TO SORT OF GO FROM FORCED DEPORTATIONS AND\nA DISCUSSION ON HOW TO TREAT IMMIGRANTS AND IS HE REALLY\nSOFTENING? LET'S BRING IN SENIOR POLITICAL\nANALYST AND SENIOR EDITOR FOR \"THE ATLANTIC\" RON BROWNSTEIN\nAND WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT FOR \"TIME\" MAGAZINE, JANE NEWTON\nSMALL. THERE ARE MANY WAYS THAT PEOPLE\nARE DECIPHERING WHAT THIS MEANS ON THE PART OF DONALD TRUMP.\nLET ME ASK YOU FIRST, WHAT'S YOUR TAKE?\nWHAT'S GOING ON HERE? WHAT'S HE TRYING TO DO?\n>> FIRST, IF HE DID ABANDON THE FACT THAT HE HAD TRUMPETED\nTHROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN OF FORCED DEPORTATION, MASS\nDEPORTATION OF UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS, IT WOULD RANK AMONG\nTHE BIGGEST POLICY REVERSALS OR FLIP-FLOPS FROM THE PRIMARY OF\nGENERAL ELECTION. I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING QUITE\nLIKE IT. IT IS ON A CONCESSION TO REALITY\nTHAT MOST REPUBLICAN EXPERTS HAVE BEEN SKEPTICAL OF THE IDEA\nAND THE COST THAT YOU COULD REALLY IN PRACTICE REMOVE 11\nMILLION PEOPLE FROM THEIR HOMES AND FROM THE U.S. AND IN A PANEL\nI MODERATED IN CLEVELAND, ONE OF THE LEADING HOUSE REPUBLICANS\nSAID THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS LE\nELECTED PRESIDENT AND TRY TO DO IT, THAT THEY WOULD TRY TO STOP\nIT. IT WAS POINTED OUT THAT DURING\nTHE PRIMARIES ONE OF THE EXIT POLLS, ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THEY\nASKED, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO WITH PEOPLE HERE ILLEGALLY, GIVE\nTHEM SOME KIND OF LEGAL STATUS OR DEPORT THEM?\nIN VIRTUALLY EVERY STATE A MAJORITY OF DONALD TRUMP'S\nVOTERS SUPPORTED DEPORTATION. THEY WERE A MAJORITY OF HIS\nVOTERS. SO THIS WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT\nREVERSAL OF A CORNERSTONE OF THE APPEAL THAT HE MADE TO THE\nVOTERS THAT WERE PROPELLED INTO THE NOMINATION.\n>> DO YOU THINK THIS IS TRUE? IS HE CAPABLE OF MAKING THIS\nKIND OF SEISMIC SHIFT OR ARE WE READING THE TEA LEAVES WRONG?\n>> HE'S TRYING TO MAKE A PIVOT TO THE GENERAL ELECTION FINALLY,\nAND IT'S BEEN OBVIOUSLY A LITTLE TOO LATE.\nHE SHOULD HAVE MADE THIS PIVOT BEFORE HIS CONVENTION.\n>> WHERE IS THE PIVOT HERE? WHERE IS HE GOING?\n>> IT REFLECTS ESSENTIALLY THE FACT THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS\nRUN ABOUT $60 MILLION NEGATIVE ADVERTISING AGAINST DONALD TRUMP\nFOR THE LAST TWO MONTHS AND THE MAIN THRUST OF THOSE NEGATIVE\nADS HAVE BEEN HIS POSITION ON IMMIGRATION AND RACE.\nHE SUFFERED IN THE POLLS FOR IT. SO NOW HE'S TRYING TO SOFTEN\nTHOSE POSITIONS NOT JUST WITH THIS COMMENT ABOUT REVERSING\nHIMSELF ON IMMIGRATION BUT ALSO SAYING HE WANTS TO APPEAL TO\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS AND HE'LL WIN 95% OF THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE\nHE SAID THIS  PIVOT HIM TO BROA HIS BASE, WHICH IS A NEEDED\nPIVOT IN A GENERAL ELECTION. CAN YOU PIVOT THAT QUICKLY WITH\nONLY FIVE WEEKS TO GO BEFORE EARLY VOTING STARTS?\n>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. SOME HAVE INTERPRETED WHAT HE'S\nTRYING TO DO IS NOT JUST REACH OUT TO A BROADER MINORITY\nAUDIENCE. HE'S TRYING TO REASSURE THE\nWHITE AUDIENCE HE HAS. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?\n>> I THINK THERE'S A LOT TO THAT.\nBECAUSE THE CONUNDRUM THAT DONALD TRUMP FACES IS THAT THESE\nRACIALLY BARRED MESSAGES AND AGENDA THAT HAVE DRIVEN UP HIS\nUNFAVORABLE RATINGS AMONG MINORITY VOTERS TO UNPRECEDENTED\nHEIGHTS AND LEAVES HIM, AS JAY NOTED, FACING THE PROSPECT OF\nHISTORIC DEFICITS AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND HISPANIC\nVOTER, THE EVIDENCE IS OVERWHELMING THAT'S ALSO HURTING\nHIM WITH WHITE COLLAR WHITE VOTERS.\nTHE CONUNDRUM HE FACES IS WHEN YOU DO THIS BADLY WITH MINORITY\nVOTERS YOU HAVE TO PUSH UP YOUR WHITE VOTE.\nTHE SAME ARGUMENTS THAT DRIVE AWAY THE MINORITY VOTERS ALSO\nWORRY A LOT OF THE WHITE COLLAR WHITE VOTERS.\nHE'S TRAILING IN MOST POLLS AMONG WHITES WITH A COLLEGE\nEDUCATION. THE BIG REASON WHY HE'S TRAILING\nIS BECAUSE THEY VIEW HIM AS RACIALLY DIVISIVE IF NOT RACIST.\nI DO THINK WHETHER THIS WORKS AT ALL WITH HISPANIC OR\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS, A BIG PART OF THE GOAL IS TO REASSURE\nSOME OF THOSE SUBURBAN WHITE COLLAR WHITE VOTERS WHO NOW VIEW\nZ HIM AS A RACE IS, TRYING TO GET THEM TO GIVE HIM ANOTHER\nLOOK. >> WE TALK ABOUT WHETHER H\nCHANGING HIS MESSAGE OR HIS IMAGE.\nIS HE TRYING TO APPEAR THE SOFTER CANDIDATE OR IS HE REALLY\nGOING TO CHANGE HIS STANCE ON THIS IMAGE, WHICH IS IT?\n>> HE'S DEFINITELY TRYING TO APPEAR AS A SOFTER, KINDER\nCANDIDATE.

DOES DONALD TRUMP STILL SUPPORT\nTHE DEPORTATION FORCE AND REMOVING 11 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED\nIMMIGRANTS FROM AMERICA? YES OR NO?\n>> WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAID YESTERDAY IN THAT MEETING\nDIFFERED VERY LITTLE FROM WHAT HE SAID PUBLICLY INCLUDING IN\nHIS CONVENTION SPEECH LAST MONTH IN CLEVELAND.\nIS THAT WE NEED A QUOTE, FAIR, AND QUOTE, HUMANE WAY, OF\nDEALING WITH WHAT IS ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT 11 MILLION ILLEGAL\nIMMIGRANTS IN THIS COUNTRY. THAT WAS PART AFTER VERY ROBUST\nDISCUSSION, I'VE SEEN HIM ANIMATED IN MEETINGS WHERE HE IS\nLEARNING, TAKING NOTES, ASKING QUESTIONS, RECEIVING\nINFORMATION. AND THE REST OF THE CON VIR SAGS\nFRANKLY WAS ABOUT JOB CREATION, ECONOMIC REVITALIZATION, THE\nFACT SMALL BUSINESS GROWTH AMONG HISPANIC AND LATINO AMERICANS IS\nON THE RISE. WE TALKED ABOUT THE INABILITY TO\nGET ACCESS TO CAPITAL. FOR MANY OF THEM WE TALKED ABOUT\nHOMEOWNERSHIP HAS BEING VERY IMPORTANT, RELIGION AND FAMILY\nBEING VERY IMPORTANT TO HISPANICS.\nVERY LONG, VERY FAR-REACHING CONVERSATION BUT NOTHING SAID\nYESTERDAY DIFFERES FROM WHAT MR. TRUMP SAID PREVIOUSLY.\n>> LET ME PLAY WHEN A SAID IN NOVEMBER.\n>> THEY WILL RIPPED OUT OF THEIR HOMES?\n>> THEY ARE GOING BACK WHERE THEY CAME.\nIF THEY CAME FROM A CERTAIN COUNTRY THEY WILL BE BROUGHT\nBACK TO THAT COUNTRY.

A DEPORTATION FORCE REMOVING THE\n11 MILLION OR SO UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS?\n>> WHAT HE SUPPORTS, AND IF YOU GO BACK TO THE SPEECH A MONTH\nAGO, DANA, IS TO MAKE SURE WE ENFORCE THE LAW THAT WE ARE\nRESPECTFUL OF THOSE AMERICANS WHO ARE LOOKING FOR WELL-PAYING\nJOBS AND THAT WE ARE FAIR AND HUGH HAN MAIN FOR THOSE WHO LIVE\nAMONG US IN THIS COUNTRY. AS WEEKS UNFOLD, HE WILL LAY OUT\nTHE SPECIFICS OF THAT PLAN THAT HE WOULD IMPLEMENT AS PRESIDENT\nOF THE UNITED STATES. >> WILL THAT PLAN INCLUDE\nDEPORTATION FORCE, THE KIND THAT HE JUST, YOU JUST HEARD IN THAT\nSOUNDBITE AND THAT HE TALKED ABOUT DURING THE REPUBLICAN\nPRIMARIES? >> TO BE DETERMINED.\n>> TBD. THAT WOULD BE A SHARP CONTRAST\nFROM ONE OF TRUMP'S CENTRAL THEMES ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION\nAND JUST YESTERDAY HELD A CLOSED-DOOR MEETING WITH A\nHISPANIC ADVISORY COUNCIL AND HE TALKED ABOUT A HUMANE AND\nEFFICIENT WAY TO WORK WITH UNDOCUMENTED ILL GRANTS.\nFOR MORE ON THIS, I'M JOINED WITH KEVIN PAUL SCOTT, AND ALSO\nWE J JOINING US, I WASN'T SURE, IS HILLARY CLINTON SUPPORTER\nCRYSTAL BALL. THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.\nLET ME BE CLEAR, WE SAY TRUMP SUPPORTER.\nYOU WANT TO ADD AN AADDENDUM? >> WELL, I WILL SUPPORT THE\nNOMINEE. BUT WE SEE HIM PIVOTING FROM A\nTOUGH FEW WEEKS. HE IS SHOOTING FROM THE HIP,\nCAMPAIGN TROUBLES, IT IS NOT A CAMPAIGN THAT'S EASY TO SUPPORT\nRIGHT NOW. >> LET ME NAIL YOU DOWN ON THE\nIMMIGRATION ISSUE AND WHETHER OR NOT TRUMP IS TRULY CHANGING.\nTHAT WOULD BE WORRISOME TO SOME CORE SUPPORTERS.\n>> YEAH. THERE IS A LOT OF THINGS THAT\nARE WORRISOME WHEN IT COMES TO IS HE REALLY GOING TO SUPPORT\nEXACTLY WHEN A SAID OR IS HE PUTTING ON A SHOW FOR A PUBLIC\nAND PRIMARY VOTERS THAT HE IS WILLING TO SHIFT IN THE GENERAL\nELECTION AND EVEN MORE SCARY IS HE GOING TO SHIFT IF HE WERE TO\nACTUALLY BE ELECT SFLED. >> WHAT IS HE DOING WITH\nIMMIGRATION? >> I THINK ON IMMIGRATION WHAT\nHE IS DOING IS TAKING A DIFFERENT TONE AND WHEN IT COMES\nTO DEPORTATION, THE THING THAT TRUMP IS COMMITTED TO IS THE\nWALL. WE HAVEN'T HEARD A LOT ABOUT IT\nLATELY BUT IS HE GOING TO BUILD THE WALL?\nI THINK THAT'S WHAT HARD-CORE SUPPORTERS ARE LOOKING FOR.\nON THE THINGS THEY SEE AS MAJOR ISSUES, IS HE GOING TO DO THAT\nAND IS HE GOING TO SHIFT ON OTHER THINGS?\nHOW HE OUTREACH ANSWERS COORDINATES OUTREACHES THIS\nGROUP IS INTERESTING. OUTREACH FOR AMERICANS WAS TOUGH\nLAST WEEK. >> IT WAS.\nCRYSTAL BALL, LET ME BRING KNEW THIS CONVERSATION.\n>> YES. >> WHAT WOULD A SHIFT LIKE THIS\nBE? IF DONALD TRUMP IS SOMEHOW\nCHANGING WHAT HAD BEEN ONE OF THE SOLID PILL EARS OF HIS\nCAMPAIGN, HOW WOULD THIS IMPACT HILLARY CLINTON?\n>> OBVIOUSLY I THINK HE HAS REALIZED THAT HE CANNOT WIN THE\nWAY THAT HE IS GOING. AND IN PARTICULAR ONE THING I\nWANTED TO NOTE HERE IS I THINK THAT OUTREACH TO\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS, OUTREACH IT LATINOS IS NOT ABOUT WINNING\nOVER SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF THOSE GROUPS BECAUSE THE DAMAGE\nTHERE IS ALREADY DONE. I DON'T THINK DONALD TRUMP WILL\nGET MUCH MORE WITH AFRICAN-AMERICANS THAN THE 2% HE\nIS REGISTERING IN POLLS RIGHT NOW.\nWHAT IT IS AIMED AT THOUGH AND I THINK THAT YOU SEE THE\nFINGERPRINT OF KELLYANNE CONWAY HERE IS THAT WINNING OVER THE\nREPUBLICAN WOMEN WHO LEFT HIM BECAUSE THEY ARE INCOMFORTABLE\nWITH THIS WHITE NATIONALIST REALLY IN SOME PLACES, RHETORIC\nTHEY SEE COMING OUT OF THE CAMPAIGN, THEY CAN'T ASSOCIATE\nTHEMSELVES WITH A CANDIDATE WHO FEELS TO THEM BLATANTLY RACIST\nAND TONE DEAF. THAT'S HOW IT AFFECTS HILLARY\nCLINTON. SHE HAS DONE A LOT TO MAKE SURE\nSHE IS SPEAKING THOSE MODERATE REPUBLICANS THAT ARE\nUNCOMFORTABLE WITH DONALD TRUMP AND SAYING, LOOK, YOU MAY NOT\nAGREE WITH ME ON ANYTHING BUT YOU CAN TRUST ME AS A GOOD\nSTEWARD OF THE GOVERNMENT. THIS OTHER GUY IS UNHINGED,\nDIDN'T HAVE THE TEMPERAMENT TO BE PRESIDENT AND DOESN'T HAVE\nTHE BEHAVIOR TO BE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.\n>> SO THOSE NOT SO MUCH CONCERNED WITH IMMIGRATION BUT\nUNCOMFORTABLE WITH DONALD TRUMP ON OTHER ISSUES.\nYOU BUY THAT? >> WELL THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT\nHILLARY IS TRYING TO EXPAND THE PLAYING FIELD.\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT DONALD TRUMP'S AD BUY, IT DOESN'T INCLUDE\nVIRGINIA. THAT'S SCARY FOR REPUBLICANS.\nTHEY NEED TO BE COMPETING IN THESE PLACES.\nI DO BUY A LITTLE BIT OF THE ARGUMENT HE IS TRYING TO WIN\nBACK SOME OF THE BASE BUT I DON'T THINK HE WILL STOP THERE.\nWHEN HE TALKS ABOUT AFRICAN-AMERICANS OR HISPANICS\n, HE IS GOING TO MAKE A RUN\nBECAUSE HE NEEDS TO EAT INTO THE MARGINS AT LEAST A LITTLE BIT TO\nHAVE ANY SHOT AT BEING COMPETITIVE THIS FALL.\nI THINK HE WILL BRING BACK HIS BASE AND COMMAND THE PLAYING\nFIELD. >> TRUMP IS NOT GOING TO RELEASE\nTAX RETURNS. EVEN THOUGH THAT SHE HERSELF\nCALLED ON HIM TO DO SO IN PAST, AND TAKE A LISTEN TO THIS.\n>> BACK IN APRIL YOU SAID ON CNN YOU WANT TRUMP TOBE TRANSPARENT.\nLET'S LISTEN. >> BETWEEN JOHN KASICH AND TED\nCRUZ, THIS ALLIANCE THAT DONALD TRUMP IS CALLING COLLUSION, IS\nTHIS FAIR GAME? >> OF COURSE IT'S FAIR GAME.\nIT IS COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT. DONALD TRUMP'S TAXES AREN'T.\nI WOULD LIKE TO SEE THOSE BE TRANSPARENT.\n>> NOW YOU'RE IN CHARGE OF DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN.\nGIVEN THAT AND HOW YOU FEEL, ARE WE GOING TO SEE DONALD TRUMP'S\nTAX RETURNS SOON? >> SO NOW THAT I'M ON THE INSIDE\nI KNOW SOMETHING I DIDN'T KNOW THEN WHICH IS HE IS UNDER AUDIT\nAND WHAT THAT MEANS. HE HAS SAID CLEARLY AND I BACK\nHIM UP COMPLETELY THAT WHEN THE AUDIT IS COMPLETE HE WILL\nRELEASE THE TAX RETURNS. >> I GOT TO SAY, THAT ANSWER\nFLOORED ME.

IF THEY CAME FROM A CERTAIN\nCOUNTRY THEY'LL BE BROUGHT BACK TO THEIR COUNTRY.\nTHAT'S THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.\n>> DOES HE STILL SUPPORT THAT? REMOVING THE 11 MILLION OR SO\nUNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS? >> WHAT HE SUPPORTS -- IF YOU GO\nBACK TO HIS CONVENTION SPEECH A MONTH AGO, DANA, HE SUPPORTS\nMAKING SURE THAT WE ENFORCE THE LAW, THAT WE ARE RESPECTFUL OF\nTHOSE AMERICANS WHO ARE LOOKING FOR WELL-PAYING JOBS AND THAT WE\nARE FAIR AND HUMANE FOR THOSE WHO LIVE AMONG US IN THIS\nCOUNTRY.

WE CAN'T IMAGINE GOING UP\nAGAINST A LESS TRANSPARENT, LESS ACCOUNTABLE, MORE SORT OF RIGGED\nAND CORRUPT INDIVIDUAL AS OUR POLITICAL OPPONENT THAN HILLARY\nCLINTON.

I THINK WHAT PEOPLE ARE\nCONCERNED ABOUT IS HOW WOULD A PRESIDENT TRUMP OR HOW WOULD A\nPRESIDENT HILLARY AFFECT THEIR TAX BILL.\nEVERYDAY LIFE IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY UNAFFORDABLE FOR\nAMERICANS AND THEY DESERVE THE RELIEF HE LAID OUT IN HIS\nSPEECH. IF WE WANT TRANSPARENCY AND\nSPECIFICS, THE MOST RELEVANT THING PEOPLE CAN LOOK AT IS WHAT\nIS HIS PLAN FOR THEIR TAX BILL TO MAKE AFFORDABILITY, JOB\nSECURITY AND REBUILDING THE AMERICAN ECONOMY, WHETHER IT'S\nENERGY BASED, BRINGING BACK MANUFACTURING GOVERNOR PENCE HAS\nACCOMPLISHED ON HIS WATCH.
