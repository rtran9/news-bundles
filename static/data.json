WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY JOSH\nEARNEST PUSHED BACK AT CRITICS YESTERDAY, WHO CRITICIZED THE\nPRESIDENT FOR NOT VISITING THE STATE SOONER.\n>> THERE'S ALL TOO COMPETENT EFFECTIVE, STRONG, COORDINATED\nGOVERNMENT RESPONSE. >> HILLARY CLINTON MEANWHILE\nSAYS SHE WILL ALSO TRAVEL TOO LOUISIANA TO VISIT THE\nCOMMUNITIES AFFECTED BY THE FLOODING.\nBUT WILL DO SO, QUOTE, ATHE A TIME WHEN THE PRESENCE OF A\nPOLITICAL CAMPAIGN WILL NOT DISRUPT THE RESPONSE.\n>> AND THE ZIKA VIRUS IS SPARKING FRESH FEARS AFTER IT\nWAS CONFIRMED TO HAVE SPREAD TO MIAMI BEACH FLORIDA'S GOVERNOR\nRICK SCOTT HAS ANNOUNCED AN EMERGENCY FUND OF $5 MILLION TO\nHELP FIGHT ZIKA. HOWEVER, FLORIDA LEADERS SAY\nIT'S NOT ENOUGH, AND ARE RAMPING UP ON THEIR CALLS ON CONGRESS TO\nPASS A FUNDING BILL. >> MOSQUITOES, ZIKA, IS NOT\nREPUBLICAN AND IT'S NOT DEMOCRAT.\nIT'S A ISSUE THAT AFFECTS ALL OF US.\nWE NEED TO COME TOGETHER AS ONE, AND MAKE SURE WE GET THE PROPER\nFUNDING SO WE CAN ERADICATE THIS AND GET IT TAKEN CARE OF\nIMMEDIATELY. >> THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE SURE\nTHAT WE CAN DEVELOP A VACCINE IS PUTTING MONEY INTO IT.\nTHE RESEARCHERS CAN'T CONTINUE THAT RESEARCH WITHOUT MAKING\nSURE THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO IT.\n>> THIS ALL COMES AS STUDENTS HEADED BACK TO SCHOOL YESTERDAY\nIN MIAMI-DADE COUNTY THE SUPERINTENDENT SPENT THE FIRST\nDAY TRYING TO SOOTHE PARENTS' FEARS.\n>> THEY KNOW WHAT TO DO IF THEY RECEIVE A CALL THEY ARE AWARE,\nTHEY KNOW THE RISK FACTORS. AND SOME OF THEM HAVE, YOU KNOW,\nDRESSED IN LONG SLEEVE SHIRTS AND PANTS.\nMANY OF THEM APPLIED INSECT REPELLENT.\nBUT REALLY, THERE ARE NO WORRIES.\n>> TIME NOW TO GET A CHECK ON YOUR WEATHER WITH NBC\nMETEOROLOGIST BILL KARINS. BILL, WHAT DO WE HAVE IN STORE\nFOR US TODAY? >> WELL, LOUIS, A LOT OF US ARE\nGOING TO HAVE A BEAUTIFUL DAY TODAY.\nBUT OTHER PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO GET I DON'T WANT TO SAY WORRIED\nBUT THE RADAR IS UP. THE ATTENTION IS NOW BEING\nFOCUSED ON THE HURRICANE SEASON, ESPECIALLY ANYONE THAT LIVES IN\nTHE SOUTHEAST. WE'RE HEADING TOWARDS THE PEAK\nOF OUR SEASON. THINGS ARE STARTING TO GET\nACTIVE. HERE'S WHERE WE ARE IN THE\nCALENDAR. THIS IS THE PEAK SEPTEMBER 10th\nAND NOW WE QUICKLY RAMP THINGS UP.\nTHIS IS WHERE WE ARE. IT'S NOT A SURPRISE THAT LAST\nNIGHT WE HAD A NEW NAMED SYSTEM. WE HAVE TROPICAL STORM GASTON\nTHAT WE'RE NOW TRACKING. THREE STORMS KIND OF IN LINE OUT\nIN THE ATLANTIC THIS IS THE FUSHTEST ONE AWAY FROM US, WELL\nOFF THE COAST OF AFRICA, WELL OUT HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE\nATLANTIC, JUST A WEAK TROPICAL STORM.\nTHEN WE HAVE WHAT'S LEFT OF FIONA DYING QUICKLY AND THEN WE\nHAVE OUR TROPICAL WAVE THAT'S A LITTLE HEALTHIER.\nTHAT'S THE ONE I'M MOST CONCERNED WITH AND EVERYONE IN\nTHE SOUTHEAST IS WATCHING. TROPICAL STORM GASTON WILL\nLIKELY BECOME A HURRICANE LATER TODAY OR TOMORROW BUT HARMLESSLY\nGOING OUT INTO THE OPEN ATLANTIC.\nBERMUDA WILL STILL NEED TO WATCH IT.\nEVERYBODY ELSE ON THE EAST COAST LOOKS SAFE FROM THAT STORM.\nALL OF THESE LINE ARE DIFFERENT COMPUTER MODELS THAT ARE GIVING\nUS THEIR BEST GUEST ESTIMATES OF WHERE IT'S GOING TO BE HEADING\nIN THE NEXT FIVE DAYS. SO WE TAKE IT FIVE DAYS FROM\nRIGHT NOW, POSSIBLY BRUSHING JUST NORTH OF THE VIRGIN\nISLANDS, PUERTO RICO, AND THEN HEADING UP SOMEWHERE NEAR THE\nBAHAMAS. SOME OF OUR TRACKS ARE TRYING TO\nTAKE IT IN THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF FLORIDA.\nSO THAT GETS OUR ATTENTION IMMEDIATELY.\nTHE WATER'S VERY WARM ALONG THIS PATH.\nSO NOW IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF CAN THIS STORM GET ITS ACT\nTOGETHER? SOME OF OUR COMPUTER MODELS\nTHINK IT WILL BE BARELY NOTHING AT ALL.\nVERY, YOU KNOW, JUST MAYBE SOME RAIN AND SQUALLS GOING THROUGH\nFLORIDA. OTHER OF OUR COMPUTER MODELS\nTHINK IT COULD INTENSIFY AND POSSIBLY BE A HURRICANE SO\nTHAT'S WHY WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO WATCH THAT AGAIN THE TIMING\nFOR FLORIDA IN THE BAHAMAS WOULD BE SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY AS WE\nGO INTO NEXT WEEK. SO THE FORECAST FOR TODAY, I\nMENTIONED THERE'S SOME BEAUTIFUL WEATHER OUT THERE, D.C. THROUGH\nTHE NORTHEAST, IT'S COOL, IT'S REFRESHING, WINDOWS SHOULD BE\nOPEN, AND IT'S GOING TO BE GORGEOUS SOUTHEAST WILL GET SOME\nSHOWERS AND STORMS. YOU KNOW, FRANCES, I WOULDN'T\nDOUBT IF THERE WILL BE MORE THAN ONE PERSON TURNING THE HEAT ON\nIN THEIR CAR THIS MORNING AS THEY HEAD ESPECIALLY IN THE\nNORTHEAST, TEMPERATURES IN THE 50s.\n>> YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT THAT.\nI TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT YESTERDAY BUT GASTON HOPEFULLY YOU KNOW,\nWILL BE HARMLESS. >> GASTON WILL BE THE HARMLESS\nONE. IT'S THE OTHER ONE WE'RE GOING\nTO HAVE TO WATCH. >> JUST LIKE THE CHARACTER FROM\nBEAUTY AND THE BEAST, THAT'S GASTON.\nYOU SHOULD KNOW THAT. >> I DO VERY WELL.\n>> THERE IS AN UNIDENTIFIED MYTHICAL-LIKE CREATURE CREEPING\nTHROUGH THE WOODS IN MAINE. NOW LOOK AT THIS.\nTHIS IS A MASSIVE 10 FOOT LONG SNAKE THE SAME ONE THEY SAW IN\nJUNE WHILE IT WAS EATING A LARGE MAMMAL.\nTHIS IS FOUND THIS WEEKEND NEAR A HIKING TRAIL IN THE CITY OF\nWESTBROOK. OFFICIALS BELIEVE THE SKIN\nBELONGED TO A PET PYTHON THAT WAS LEFT THERE.\nCOPS HAVE NAMED THE UNIDENTIFIED REPTILE WESSY A NOD TO THE TOWN\nAND THE LOCH NESS MONSTER. THE TWITTER PAGE OVER 1400\nFOLLOWERS. AND HAS PLENTY TO SAY ABOUT\nPOLITICS HERE. AND YOU KNOW WHAT?\nVERY INTERACTIVE IF WESSIE IS WATCHING, I TWEETED AND SAID\nYOU'RE GOING TO BE ON MSNBC IN A COUPLE MINUTES.\nOH, YEAH, MORE TV TIME. YES, YES, THANK YOU FOR THE\nHEADS UP. SO WE HAVE A FAN.\n>> PYTHONS IN MAINE? THAT'S STRANGE.\n>> THAT'S WHAT IT IS. AND A TWITTER ACCOUNT AS WELL.\nALL RIGHT. STILL AHEAD WE HAVE ALL THE\nHIGHLIGHTS FROM MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL PLUS FORMER LAKERS STAR\nKOBE BRYANT ONLY RETIRED A FEW MONTHS AGO BUT SEEMS HE'S READY\nTO TRADE IN THE BASKETBALL COURT FOR THE BOARD ROOM.\n>> ACTUALLY BOB COSTAS SAYS HE THINKS RYAN LOCHTE MAY HAVE COST\nHIMSELF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN POTENTIAL ENDORSEMENTS FOLLOWING\nTHE RIO SCANDAL. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.\nHE JUST SIGNED A BUNCH OF BIG ENDORSEMENTS IN THE PAST FEW\nDAYS. HE'S ENDORSING DISHONEST TEA.\nHE'S ALSO ENDORSING THE SHOE BRAND SKETCHY.\nYOU KNOW THOSE. THEY'RE COMFORTABLE.\nTHEY'RE COMFORTABLE SHOES. >> THEY'RE A LITTLE SKETCHY.\n>> AND FINALLY THE NEW SPOKESMAN FOR THE BOOK RIO FOR DUMMIES.\nSO HE'LL BE FINE. HE'S FINE.",

FIRST, SHE LOOKS SICK.\n>> THIS IS THE GOTCH-YOU VIDEO DURING WHICH HILLARY CLINTON WAS\nSITTING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS AS WAS EVERYBODY ELSE.\nIT WOULD HAVE BEEN WEIRD IF SHE WERE STANDING.\nIT'S WORTH NOING ON THE SPECTRUM OF CHANGE, GUILIANI IS PRETTY\nFAR ALONG NOT JUST HEALTH CONSPIRACY THEORIES, DEFENDING\nTRUMP'S MOST BIGOTED POLICY POSITIONS POINTED OUT BY COBB.\nWHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THE APPALLING LAST ACT.\n>> THIS IS A QUICK PREFACE POINT.\nONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS NEW YORKERS REMEMBER, GUILIANI\nWAS SUPPOSED TO CHALLENGE HILLARY CLINTON FOR THAT SENATE\nSEAT AND HE PULLED OUT BECAUSE OF HIS HEALTH.\n>> THAT'S RIGHT. >> THAT'S TRUE.\nI FORGET ABOUT THAT. >> HE HAD A PROJECTION OF\nPROSTATE CANCER, TO GIVE YOU HEALTH PROJECTION GOING ON HERE.\nTHE OTHER CASE WITH HIM IS THERE WERE -- HE WAS AN ABRASIVE\nPERSON, A POLARIING PERSON WHEN HE WAS MAYOR HERE.\nCERTAINLY, THERE WERE MANY AFRICAN-AMERICANS WHO WERE OFF\nPUTT BY HIS INABILITY TO RECOGNIZE EXCESSIVE FORCE BY\nPOLICE OFFICERS AND THERE WERE MANY THINGS YOU HAD TO GIVE HIM\nCREDIT ON, REDEEMING QUALITIES. WHEN PROPOSITION 187 HAPPENED IN\nCALIFORNIA, WHICH WOULD HAVE DENIED CRUCIAL SOCIAL SERVICES\nAND EMERGENCY SERVICES AND PARAMEDICS TO PEOPLE IN THE\nCOUNTRY UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS, GUILIANI SAID THAT WAS INHUMANE,\nNOT ONCE BUT THREE DIFFERENT TIMES.\n>> HERE IS A QUOTE IN 1996 ON IMMIGRATION.\nTHE ANTI-IMMIGRATION ISSUE THAT'S NOW SWEEPING THE COUNTRY\nIS IN MY VIEW NO DIFFERENT THAN IN THE PAST THE NO NOTHING\nMOVEMENT THAT WERE MOVEMENTS THAT WERE FEAR FORMERS TO STOP\nIMMIGRATION. A LONG WAY FROM DEPORTATION.\n>> ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS HE DID PEOPLE DIDN'T REMEMBER,\nRIGHT AFTER 9/11, WHEN THERE WERE THESE REPORTS OF PEOPLE OF\nARAB DESCENT OR MUSLIM BEING TARGETED AND ATTACK, GUILIANI\nSPOKE OUT AGAINST THAT VOCALLY, AND NOW TO COME FULL CIRCLE AND\nTO HAVE EMBEDDED HIMSELF ESSENTIALLY WITH THE MOST\nPROMINENT ZENE -- ZENAPHOBE IN AMERICAN HISTORY.\n>> EVERYONE IN THE TRUMP ORBIT ENDS UP DIMINISHED OR HUMILIATED\nBY THE EXPERIENCE. CHRIS CHRISTIE SEEMS TO HAVE\nWISELY DISTANCED HIMSELF AFTER HE DIDN'T GET THE VP SLOT.\nEVERYONE WAS COVERING THE WAY CHRISTIE SEEMED TO BE LIKE THE\nERRAND BOY. NOW, YOU HAVE GUILIANI.\nSOMETHING ABOUT THE MAGNETIC POLITICAL FORCE OF DONALD TRUMP,\nDARKLY MAGNETIC, WHEN YOU GET IN THE ORBIT, YOU END UP IN THE\nVORTEX. >> RIGHT.\nWHAT'S INTERESTING, EVEN RECENTLY, GUILIANI HAD SPOKEN\nOUT AGAINST SOME OF TRUMP'S POLICIES, WHICH WAS THAT IN MAY,\nWHEN TRUMP WAS TALKING ABOUT CREAING THE BAN ON MUSLIM\nIMMIGRATION, GUILIANI SAID THAT WOULD VIOLATE THE FIRST\nAMENDMENT AND UNNECESSARY. THEN, A FEW MONTHS LATER HE WAS\nSAYING, WELL, PERHAPS I WOULD CONSIDER LEADING THE COMMISSION\nTHAT TRUMP SAYS HE WANTS TO PUT TOGETHER ON THIS ISSUE.\n>> WHAT IS ALSO STRIING TO ME ASIDE FROM TELLING PEOPLE TO\nGOOGLE, YOU CAN TELL THEM TO GOOGLE CONTROL DEMOLITION IN\nBUILDING 7. >> OR AREA 51.\n>> AS DAVE WIGLE POINTED OUT IN A DIFFERENT TWEET.\n>> GUILIANI IS SORT OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BEING HELD\nTOGETHER ESSENTIALLY FOCUSED ON HILLARY ANIMUS.\nWHAT HE GETS PASSIONATE ABOUT IS THAT PART OF THE EQUATION.\n>> THAT ELECTION HE NEVER GOT TO RUN IN.\nONE OF THE MORE INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT HIM IS HE DOES NOT\nHAVE ANY CONSTITUENCY HE HAS TO APPEAL TO.\nHE DOES NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE RNC PULLING FUNDS FROM HIS\nRE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN, NONE OF THESE THINGS.\nI THINK HE IS DESPERATE FOR RELEVANCE AT THIS POINT.\n>> THAT BRUISE YOU SAW GUILIANI ADDRESSING WAS THE RESULT OF AN\nINJURY SUSTAINED IN CIRCUMSTANCES NOT QUITE UNCLEAR\nAND IT WOULD BE SORT OF APPALLING FOR ME TO SIT ON\nTELEVISION AND STOWGT PEOPLE THAT THEY SPECULATE OR GOOGLE\nABOUT THAT.

I KNOW IT WILL BE HARD FOR\nPRESIDENT CLINTON BECAUSE HE CARES VERY DEEPLY ABOUT WHAT THE\nFOUNDATION HAS DONE. IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP IT\nOPEN WITHOUT, AT LEAST, THE APPEARANCE OF A PROBLEM.\nNOW, HAVING HAD A CHANCE TO CONFER WITH THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN\nABOUT THIS, THIS MORNING THE EARLIER REMARKS WERE AMENDED.\n>> SHOULD THERE BE A WALL BETWEEN THE CLINTONS AND ANY\nFUND-RAISING GOING FORWARD, YEAH, I THINK SO, ABSOLUTELY.\nI WOULD SET UP THE STRONGEST CHINESE WALL THEY COULD.\nCOULD IT BE TURNED OVER TO PARTNERS AND PEOPLE OF CLINTONS\nTO TRUST AND RUN IF THE SECRETARY TO BECOME PRESIDENT\nWITHOUT ANY OF HER KNOWLEDGE WHO IS CONTRIBUTING.\nYES, I THINK THAT CAN BE DONE. >> JONATHAN SHAY FROM NEW YORK\nMAGAZINE HIS NEW COLUMN IS ENTITLED \"HILLARY CLINTON'S\nETHICS PROBLEMS IS WORSE THAN SHE UNDERSTAND.\"\nHOW DO YOU SEE IT? >> I THINK ED HAVE IT RIGHT THE\nFIRST TIME HE MADE HIS COMMENTS AND BEFORE THEY MAYBE HAD A\nLITTLE CHAT WITH HIM. LOOK, THE PURPOSE OF THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION IS A VERY POSITIVE ONE.\nTHE PURPOSE IS TO LEVERAGE THE THING WITH THE CLINTONS INTO\nRAISING MONEY FOR CHARITY. BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT HAS A\nSIDE EFFECT. THE SIDE EFFECT IS THAT RICH\nPEOPLE WHO WANT THE FAVOR OF THE CLINTONS FOR ANY KIND OF PUBLIC\nPOLICY KNOW THAT THEY CAN GET THAT FAVOR BY GIVING MONEY TO\nTHE CLINTON FOUNDATION, IF YOU GIVE MONEY TO THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION, THEN YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE, THEN YOU'RE AT THE\nFRONT OF THE LINE FOR A MEETING, POST, WHATEVER IT IS YOU'RE\nAFTER. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S\nNECESSARILY CORRUPT, BUT IT'S JUST NOT THE KIND OF PUBLIC\nPOLICY YOU REALLY WANT YOUR PRESIDENT TO BE HAVING.\nI THINK IT'S A BIGGER POLITICAL PROBLEM THAN THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN REALLY SEEMS TO BE AWARE.\n>> LET'S LISTEN ON THE WAY DONALD TRUMP IS TALKING ABOUT\nTHIS NOW. THIS IS WHAT HE SAID TONIGHT.\n>> HER FOUNDATION TOOK IN LARGE PAYMENTS FROM MAJOR\nCORPORATIONS, WEALTHY INDIVIDUALS, FOREIGN AND DO\nMYSTIC, THE CLINTONS MADE THE STATE DEPARTMENT INTO THE SAME\nKIND OF PLAY FOR PLAY OPERATION THAN THE ARKANSAS GOVERNMENT\nWAS. THE AMOUNTS INVOLVED, THE FAVOR\nIS DONE AND THE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF TIMES IT WAS DONE,\nREQUIRE AN EXPEDITED AN INVESTIGATION BY A SPECIAL\nPROSECUTOR IMMEDIATELY, IMMEDIATELY, IMMEDIATELY.\n>> ONE OF THE POINTS YOU MAKE IN YOUR PIECE IS THAT ONE OF THE\nREASONS YOU SUSPECT HILLARY CLINTON ON THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN,\nDON'T UNDERSTAND THE WAY THIS PLAYS IS THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT\nTHE CLINTONS HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG, THEREFORE, NOTHING REALLY\nNEEDS TO BE CORRECTED, BUT YOUR ARGUMENT IS ABOUT THE PERCEPTION\nOF THIS. >> WELL, IT'S THE PERCEPTION OF\nTHIS AND THE POSSIBILITY FOR REAL CONFLICTS TO ARISE FROM\nTHIS FOUNDATION AND PUBLIC POLICY.\nPART OF THE PROBLEM -- AS YOU JUST SAW -- THERE ARE CRITICS\nARE OFTEN HYSTERICAL AND OFTEN HYPOCRITE CAL.\nAND DONALD TRUMP IS ONE OF THE FLAMBOYANT PEOPLE TO SPEAK --\nTHEY'RE RIGHT, BUT THAT CAN'T BE THE STANDARD THAT YOU HOLD\nYOURSELF TO. YOU JUST CAN'T BE MUCH BETTER\nTHAN YOUR OPPONENTS, YOU CAN'T RELY ON THE FACT YOUR OPPONENTS\nGO OVER BOARD, YOU NEED TO LOOK AT YOURSELF.\nYOU NEED TO SAY ARE WE DOING EVERYTHING THE RIGHT WAY AND IN\nTHIS INSTANCE, THEY'RE NOT. >> I THINK OF JAY ROCKEFELLER\nSENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA AND THE GREAT ENORMOUS ROCKEFELLER\nFOUNDATION THAT HE HAD -- HE HAD NO CONNECTION TO, REALLY, AS HE\nWAS A SENATOR. THAT IS SUCH A DIFFERENT THING.\nTHAT WAS THE ROCKEFELLER FAMILY GIVING AWAY THEIR MONEY, NOT\nTAKING CONTRIBUTIONS FROM ANYONE.\nAND SO GOVERNOR ROCKEFELLER IN NEW YORK, SENATOR ROCKEFELLERS\nIN WEST VIRGINIA THEY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH TAKING IN\nCONTRIBUTIONS TO THIS THING. >> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.\nTHAT'S WHERE THE PROBLEM COMES IN.\nTHE PROBLEM COMES IN THAT THEY'RE IN A POSITION OF ASKING\nFAVORS FROM POWERFUL PEOPLE. NOW, IT'S NOT A PERSONAL FAVOR.\nIT'S NOT LIKE THE SPEECHES THAT THEY WERE GIVING TO THESE\nBUSINESS INTERESTS, IT'S A FAVOR FOR THIS FOUNDATION.\nWHEN YOU ASK SOMEONE A FAVOR, THAT PERSON IS GOING TO FEEL\nOWED AND THAT'S A PROBLEM. >> WHAT ABOUT THE NOTION IF\nYOU'RE GOING TO CHANGE THIS PRACTICE IN THE PRESIDENCY, WHY\nNOT CHANGE IT RIGHT NOW. >> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.\nWHY NOT CHANGE IT RIGHT NOW, WHY NOT CHANGE IT DURING THE\nCAMPAIGN WHEN THERE'S STILL THE SAME CHANGE POINT ABOVE THE\nCHARITABLE FOUNDATION. I DON'T SEE HOW ANYTHING LIKE\nTHIS FOUNDATION CAN CONTINUE IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THESE\nPROGRAMS OVER, YOU CAN DO THAT. BUT AS LONG AS THERE'S A WORLD\nIN WHICH SOMEONE SAYS I GIVE MONEY TO THIS CAUSE, MAYBE I CAN\nGET MY CALL RETURNED FROM HILLARY CLINTON.\nMAYBE I CAN GET THIS MEETING OR THIS POST, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT\nCAN'T ACCEPT. >> COMING UP THE \"NEW YORK\nTIMES\" REPORT ON DONALD TRUMP'S DEBT, INCLUDING A DEBT TO CHINA.\nTHE REPORTER WHO BROKE THE STORY WILL JOIN US ALONG WITH DAVID K.\nJOHNSTON THE AUTHOR OF A NEW BOOK.\nLATER, HIS NEW TV AD STARS DONALD TRUMP.\nTHAT'S IN TONIGHT'S CAMPAIGN WAR ROOM.",

IF YOU DON'T HAVE FLOOD\nINSURANCE, MAYBE YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO MOVE BACK AND\nYOU'RE FORCED TO MAKE A CHOICE WHERE YOU WALK AWAY.\n>> RIGHT. AND I REALLY HOPE THAT DOESN'T\nHAPPEN. I THINK THERE IS FEDERAL AID FOR\nTHESE PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN GET THE HELP TO GET BACK INTO THEIR\nHOMES. BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF\nPEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY THEIR MORTGAGE AND RENT AND REFURBISH\nTHEIR HOUSE. SO I THINK HOPEFULLY WE WILL GET\nTHE AID THAT THEY NEED AND THEY CAN GET THEIR HOMES BACK UP AND\nMOVE BACK INTO THEIR HOMES. >> DONNA, THIS HAS BEEN -- THIS\nIS BRIAN SULLIVAN. IT'S BEEN A VERY DIFFICULT\nDECADE FOR THE STATE OF LOUISIANA.\n>> IT HAS. >> NOT ONLY OBVIOUSLY WITH\nKATRINA THAT'S THE WORST OF THE WORST, YOU HAVE THIS NOW, WE HAD\nFLOODING A FEW YEARS AGO WHERE THEY HAD TO OPEN UP THE SPILLWAY\nFOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 1937. WE'RE SORT OF LURCHING FROM\nTHESE DISASTERS TO DISASTERS. IS ANYBODY TALKING ABOUT\nLONG-TERM SOLUTIONS HERE? BECAUSE I JUST DON'T SEE WHERE\nTHE STATE HAS THE MONEY, UNFORTUNATELY.\n>> CORRECT. AND THE CORPS OF ENGINEERS HAD\nJUST REDID OUR FLOOD MAPS RECENTLY.\nSO THIS WAS -- BUT, YOU KNOW, HERE'S THE OTHER SIDE.\nYOU TAKE 30 INCHES OF RAIN IN TWO-DAY PERIOD AND YOU DROP IT\nANYWHERE IN THE UNITED STATES, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE AN EVENT.\nSO I DON'T KNOW THAT IT WAS LOUISIANA-SPECIFIC THAT IT\nHAPPENED, IT JUST, YOU KNOW, 30 INCHES OF RAIN IN TWO DAYS AND\nIT HAPPENED. AND IT JUST HAPPENED AND\nHAPPENED IN LOUISIANA. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE LONG-TERM\nSOLUTION IS. YOU KNOW, WE ARE -- BUT I WILL\nTELL YOU WITH ALL THE GUT WRENCHING STORIES, AND I PROMISE\nTHEY ARE OVERWHELMING AND THERE ARE MANY, THE CULTURE OF\nLOUISIANA IS ALIVE AND WELL. THERE ARE STRANGERS HELPING\nSTRANGERS. EVERYONE HAS A FAMILY LIVING\nWITH THEM. YOU KNOW, THEY'RE OUT AND\nTHEY'RE AT COSTCO AND THEY'RE BUYING AND DELIVERING, SO THE\nCULTURE IS ALIVE AND WELL IN LOUISIANA.\nAND WE'RE TRYING TO REBUILD AND RECOVER TOGETHER.\n>> ALL RIGHT. WELL, THAT'S A SILVER LINING.\nDONNA, THANK YOU. DONNA WOLFF.\n>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.",

I MEAN, WHY CAN'T THEY END THIS\nISSUE? WHY KEEP DISCUSSING IT?\n>> WELL, THEY DIDN'T KEEP DISCUSSING IT.\nTHAT'S KIND OF THE MISNOMER HERE, DON.\nTHAT'S WHERE PEOPLE GET THIS CONVOLUTED AND CONFLATE THE\nISSUES. SHE WAS ACTUALLY SPEAKING TO\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATORS AT THE FBI AND THEY TAKE THEIR NOTES, THEIR\nINVESTIGATIVE NOTES ON WHETHER TO CALL 302s, WHICH WERE TURNED\nOVER TO THE U.S. CONGRESS AND SINCE HAVE BEEN LEAKED TO \"THE\nNEW YORK TIMES.\" SO NO, SHE WASN'T THROWING THIS\nIN THE FACE OF COLIN POWELL OR ANYONE ELSE, BUT I WILL NOT DO\nAS A SUPPORTER OF HILLARY CLINTON OR A COMMENTER AT CNN OR\nANYBODY ELSE IS TRY TO IMPUGN THE CHARACTER OF COLIN POWELL.\nI JUST WON'T DO THAT. I WILL SAY THAT I THINK THERE IS\nA LOT GOING ON HERE, A LOT WE DON'T KNOW AND THAT IS ONE OF\nTHE REASONS I WANTED THESE NOTES TO BE RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC IN\nFULL, NOT PIECEMEAL BECAUSE NOW WE HAVE LEAKS AND WE ONLY KNOW\nONE PART OF WHAT WAS SAID AND NOT THE FULL CONVERSATION.\n>> GO NEITHER OF THEM BELIEVES IN\nTRANSPARENCY. THEY'RE AWFUL ABOUT IT, BOTH OF\nTHEM. BUT SHE HAS A REAL RECORD, A\nWHOLE RECORD OVER 30 YEARS AND TRUMP DOES TOO, IN PUBLIC, AND\nIT DOESN'T HOLD UP IN TERMS OF BEING PREPARED FOR THE\nPRESIDENCY THE WAY THAT HILLARY --\n>> WHAT CARL IS REFERRING TO IS THE STATE DEPARTMENT BEING\nORDERED TO REVIEW 15,000 NEW HILLARY CLINTON DOCUMENTS\nPROVIDED BY JUDICIAL WATCH. AND YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MANY\nE-MAILS OR JUST WHAT OTHER DOCUMENTS OR ATTACHMENTS.\nBUT HERE IS HOW THE CAMPAIGN RESPONDS.\nTHE CAMPAIGN HAS SAID, HILLARY CLINTON HAS PROVIDED THE STATE\nDEPARTMENT WITH ALL THE WORK RELATED E-MAILS SHE HAD IN 2015.\nWE'RE NOT SURE WHAT ADDITIONAL MATERIALS THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT\nMAY HAVE LOCATED BUT IF THE STATE DEPARTMENT DETERMINES ANY\nOF THEM COB WORK-RELATED, THEN OBVIOUSLY WE SUPPORT THOSE\nDOCUMENTS BEING RELEASED PUBLICLY AS WELL.\nYOU'RE SHAKING YOUR HEAD, KAYLEIGH, WHY?\n>> IT'S BAFFLING. WE'VE HAD THE FBI DIRECTOR, JIM\nCOMEY, COME OUT AND SAY UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY BEFORE\nCONGRESS, SHE DID NOT TURN OVER ALL WORK-RELATED E-MAILS.\nIN FACT, THERE WERE THOUSANDS THAT WE FOUND.\nSHE SAID HER TEAM WENT E-MAIL BY E-MAIL, AND WE FOUND OUT THAT IS\nNOT WHAPDS. THEY DID SEARCH TERMS.\nTHEY DID NOT SCRUTINIZE EVERY SINGLE E-MAIL SO TO DOUBLE DOWN\nON A STATEMENT THAT THE FBI DIRECTOR HAS ALREADY\nCONTRADICTED IS WHY THIS STORY CONTINUALLY STAYS IN THE NEWS.\n>> ANDRE, WHAT IS YOUR REACTION? >> WELL, IT'S WHY HER NEGATIVES\nARE SO HIGH, AND IT'S NOT JUST THIS.\nIT'S THE CONTINUAL DRIP, AND IT'S NOT JUST TRYING TO PUT THE\nFIRE OUT AND ADMIT ALL GUILT AND MOVE FORWARD, AND WHEN YOU LOOK\nBACK, YOU KNOW, I HEARD HIM SAY THAT HILLARY HAS A GREAT PAST.\nI WOULD ARGUE AS A UNITED STATES SENATOR, WHAT BILLS DID SHE PUT\nFORTH? I THINK OTHER THAN NAMING A\nCOURTHOUSE, SHE DIDN'T PASS ONE BILL AS A UNITED STATES SENATOR.\nJUST BECAUSE SHE HELD THE TITLE, THAT MEANS SHE REALLY DID\nANYTHING. >> SHE WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO\nFOUGHT FOR WORKER'S RESPONDERS AND WORKER'S COMPENSATION FOR\nFIRST RESPONDERS IN NEW YORK AFTER 9/11.\nBUT PLEASE CONTINUED, ANDRE. >> BAKARI, YOU AND I HAVE BEEN\nIN THE LEGISLATURE A LONG TIME, AND BOTH OF US FOUGHT FOR ALL\nKINDS OF THINGS AND WE CAN TAKE CREDIT FOR SOMETHING THAT REALLY\nSOMEBODY ELSE PUSHED THROUGH BECAUSE WE WERE A COSPONSOR OF A\nBILL -- >> BUT I HAVE TO SAY, ANDRE,\nEVEN FIRST RESPONDERS LIVING HERE IN NEW YORK AND MEMBERS OF\nTHEIR FAMILIES WILL SAY THAT HILLARY CLINTON FOUGHT FOR THEM.\n>> WELL, SHE RAN ON CREATING 200,000 NEW JOBS IN UPSTATE NEW\nYORK. THEY TACTUALLY HAVE A NEGATIVE\nONE. YOU GO TO SECRETARY OF STATE,\nTHEY HAVE A NEGATIVE ONE THERE -- ALL SORTS OF IMPROPRIETIES.\nLOOK, GIVE ALL YOU CAN BEFORE -- WHY NOT DO IT NOW.\nIT'S LIKE HAVING A BLUE LIGHT SPECIAL.\nWE GOT 78 # DAYS, GIVE ALL YOU CAN BEFORE SHE BECOMES\nPRESIDENT. IT'S AN OVERALL TONE THAT SHE'S\nNEVER CLEANING THE MESS UP. THAT SHE JUST DOESN'T ADMIT\nGUILT AND MOVE FORWARD AND THAT'S WHY IT'S A CONTINUAL\nDRIP. >> WHY DO YOU CALL IT A CULTURAL\nWARS, YOU SAID GETTYSBURG, THE CULTURAL WARS, WHY?\n>> BECAUSE THE CLINTONS HAVE BEEN IN THE MIDST OF THIS\nTERRIBLE NATIONAL DEBATE FOR THE LAST 35 YEARS OVER WHAT KIND OF\nCOUNTRY WE ARE. AND THEY HAVE BEEN BLAMED FOR\nALL THE SINS OF THE LEFT, THE CENTER AND LEFT, AND THE RIGHT\nWING HAS TAKEN THEM ON. SHE HAS BEEN IDENTIFYING THE\nVAST RIGHT WING CONSPIRACY, AND NOW WE'RE SEEING A FIGHT TO THE\nDEATH OF THESE TWO POINTS OF VIEW, OF TRUMPISM AND\nCLINTONISM, BUT TRUMPISM TRANSCENDS JUST A POLITICAL\nQUESTION, BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT HIS BUSINESS PRACTICES AND ON\nAND ON AND ON, WHEREAS CLINTONISM IS ABOUT A VIEW OF\nPUBLIC LIFE, PUBLIC SERVICE, AND WHAT IT OUGHT TO BE AND WHETHER\nPEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY SUPPORT IT OR THEY DON'T.\n>> ALL RIGHT.

BUT HE'S STILL INSISTING ON\nBUILDING A WALL ALONG THE BORDER WITH MEXICO.\nA LOT TO GET TO THIS HOUR AHEAD. I WANT TO BRING IN CNN\nCORRESPONDENT PHIL MATTINGLY. HELLO, MR. MATTINGLY.\nYOU'RE FOLLOWING THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN FOR US TONIGHT.\nTHEY'RE DELAYING THE SPEECH ON IMMIGRATION HE WAS DUE TO GIVE\nLATER THIS WEEK. HE DID BRING THE ISSUE UP AT THE\nCAMPAIGN RALLY EARLIER TONIGHT. WHAT'S HE SAYING?\n>> IF YOU LISTEN TO WHAT HIS CAMPAIGN IS SAYING, THEY'RE A\nBIT ALL OVER THE PLACE ABOUT WHAT THEIR IMMIGRATION STRATEGY,\nIMMIGRATION POLICY ACTUALLY IS. ONE ELEMENT, YOU KNOW FOR SURE\nWILL BE IN THAT FINAL POLICY WHEN THAT SPEECH EVENTUALLY\nOCCURS, THE WALL. THIS IS WHAT DONALD TRUMP HAD TO\nTELL SUPPORTERS IN AKRON TONIGHT.\n>> IMMIGRATION SECURITY, WE NEED TO PROTECT AMERICAN JOBS.\nWE NEED TO PROTECT AMERICAN SAFETY.\n[ CROWD CHANTING \"BUILD THAT WALL\" ]\nWE'RE GOING TO BUILD A WALL, FOLKS.\nWE'RE GOING TO BUILD THE WALL. WE'RE GOING TO BUILD IT.\nDON'T WORRY, WE'RE GOING TO BUILD THE WALL.\nTHAT WALL WILL GO UP SO FAST, YOUR HEAD WILL SPIN AND YOU'LL\nSAY, YOU KNOW, HE MEANT IT. AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE I MEAN?\nMEXICO IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL.\n>> SO OBVIOUSLY, DON, NO WAVERING ON THAT KEY ELEMENT OF\nDONALD TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION PROPOSALS WE'VE SEEN UP TO THIS\nPOINT. BUT THERE IS A LOT OF WAVERING\nAND SOME EQUIVOCATION ON WHAT DONALD TRUMP MEANS IN TERMS OF\nTHE 11 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS THAT RESIDE IN THE\nCOUNTRY. THE CAMPAIGN STARTED TO BACK OFF\nA BIT ON THE HARDLINE VIEWS THAT ALL 11 MILLION-PLUS WOULD NEED\nTO BE DEPORTED. HOW THEY'RE GOING TO RECONCILE\nTHIS IS UP IN THE AIR RIGHT NOW. YOU HEARD KELLYANNE CONWAY SAY\nON CNN'S \"STATE OF THE UNION\" THAT TBD WOULD BE THE BEST WAY\nTO DESCRIBE THINGS. BUT YOU WONDER WHY THAT SPEECH\nWAS POSTPONED. THIS IS THE ISSUE RIGHT NOW.\nINSIDE TRUMP TOWER, THE DEBATE IS HOW TO PUSH FORWARD THE\nIMMIGRATION POLICY BUT NOT DO SO IN A WAY THAT TURNS OFF A LARGE\nPORTION OF THE ELECTORATE. AS YOU KNOW, DON, THEY ARE\nLOOKING FORWARD TO NOVEMBER RIGHT NOW AND RECOGNIZING THAT\nTHEY NEED TO REACH OUT TO OTHER GROUPS THAN JUST THE BLUE-COLLAR\nWHITE MALES THAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING SO WELL WITH UP TO THIS\nPOINT. THIS IS WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN\nTERMS OF WHY WE'RE HEARING DIFFERENT MESSAGES FROM\nDIFFERENT ADVISORS ON THIS ISSUE, DON.\n>> THANK YOU, PHIL MATTINGLY REPORTING TO US TONIGHT FROM NEW\nYORK. I WANT TO BRING IN CNN POLITICAL\nREPORTERS MAY BRESSEN, ALSO M.J. LEE.\nHELLO TO YOU. THANK YOU BOTH FOR COMING ON.\nTRUMP DELAYING THAT SPEECH ON IMMIGRATION TO FINE TUNE THE\nPLAN. EVEN TONIGHT WE HEARD HIM SAY\nHE'S GOING TO BUILD A WALL, MEXICO'S GOING TO PAY FOR IT.\nIT'S CLEAR WHAT HE WANTS, RIGHT? >> IT IS CLEAR WHAT HE WANTS.\nHE DID TALK ABOUT THE WALL, VERY -- AND THAT HAS OBVIOUSLY BEEN\nVERY CORE TO HIS CAMPAIGN AND LIZ IMMIGRATIONS POLICIES.\nBUT WE ARE SEEING SIGNS, AS PHIL JUST REPORTED, THAT HE IS\nGETTING READY TO SOFTEN SOME OF HIS RHETORIC ON IMMIGRATION.\nI THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT IT IS NOT NORMAL FOR A MAJOR\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AND NOW THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE TO DELAY\nA MAJOR POLICY SPEECH. THIS IS NOT THE NORM THING THAT\nHAPPENS IN PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS, AND THE FACT THAT HE\nIS INTERESTED IN FINE TUNING HIS MESSAGE, HIS AIDES HAVE SAID\nTHAT HE WANTS TO GET THIS ONE JUST RIGHT, DOES SUGGEST THAT HE\nMAYBE WANTS TO SORT OF TWEAK SOME OF THE POLICIES THAT HE\nREALLY RAN ON DURING THE PRIMARIES, AND MAYBE, YOU KNOW,\nCHANGE THE MESSAGE THAT HE RAN ON DURING THE PRIMARIES TO\nBETTER MAKE IT FIT FOR THE GENERAL ELECTION.\nI DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE TERRIBLY SURPRISED IF THIS IS\nWHAT WE SEE HAPPEN IN THE COMING WEEKS.\nHE HAS SAID ALL ALONG THAT HE'S A NEGOTIATOR, HE'S OPEN TO BEING\nA FLEXIBLE ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS AND OBVIOUSLY\nPART OF THE CALCULATION IS HE KNOWS, HIS CAMPAIGN KNOWS IT'S\nDIFFICULT TO WIN OVER INDEPENDENT VOTERS AND THOSE\nWITH HARDLINE IMMIGRATION POLICIES.\n>> THAT'S WHY YOU SAID HE'S PROBABLY TWEAKING WHAT HE'S\nGOING TO SAY. TRUMP IS NOT DOING WELL WHEN IT\nCOMES TO HISPANIC VOTERS. WHAT IS THE CAMPAIGN WEIGHING,\nYOU THINK, WHEN IT COMES TO THIS IMMIGRATION PLAN?\n>> WELL, I THINK EXACTLY TO WHAT PHIL AND M.J. JUST SAID, THEY'RE\nLOOKING TO STRADDLE THE LINE BETWEEN NOT ALIENATING ALL OF\nTHOSE SUPPORTERS THAT GOT ON BOARD WITH A TRUMP CAMPAIGN\nBECAUSE THEY LIKED THAT VERY HARD-EDGED TONE HE TOOK ON\nIMMIGRATION DURING THE PRIMARIES.\nI DON'T THINK HE HAS A LOT OF HOPE GIVEN HIS UNFAVORABLE\nNUMBERS AMONG HISPANICS. OF PICKING UP A LOT OF HISPANIC\nVOTERS AT THIS POINT NO MATTER WHAT HE SAYS IN HIS IMMIGRATION\nPOLICY SPEECH. BUT HE IS SPEAKING TO THOSE\nSWING STATE VOTERS, THOSE INDEPENDENTS WHO DON'T WANT TO\nSEE A MASSIVE IMMIGRATION CRACK DOWN, AND TO THAT POINT, I THINK\nTHAT THIS IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE ISSUES WHERE DONALD TRUMP WAS\nVERY CLEAR ON WHAT HE WANTED TO DO DURING THE PRIMARY.\nHE TALKED ABOUT AN OPERATION AND THE STYLE OF WHAT WENT ON IN\n1954 UNDER PRESIDENT EISENHOWER WHERE THEY LITERALLY ROUNDED UP\nUNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS ON FARMS AND RANCHES, PUT THEM ON BUSES\nAND SHIPPED THEM BACK TO MEXICO IN CARGO BOATS.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS A LOT OF QUOTES ON THIS SUBJECT AND SO IT'S\nGOING TO BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF HE TRIES TO REALLY BACK AWAY\nFROM THAT NOW HOW EASILY HE'LL BE ABLE TO DO THAT.\n>> ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PLAY THE TAPE WHEN SOMEONE COMES ON\nFROM EITHER PARTY SAYING MY CANDIDATE DIDN'T SAY THAT, JUST\nROLL THE TAPE. M.J., TRUMP IS ALSO ATTACKING\nHILLARY CLINTON OVER A JUDGE ORDERING THE STATE DEPARTMENT TO\nRELEASE 15,000 NEW DOCUMENTS. HERE'S MORE FROM TRUMP TONIGHT,\nAND THEN WE'LL DISCUSS. >> AFTER THE FBI, THE DEPARTMENT\nOF JUSTICE WHITEWASHED HILLARY CLINTON'S E-MAIL CRIMES, THEY\nCERTAINLY CANNOT BE TRUSTED TO QUICKLY OR IMPARTIALLY\nINVESTIGATE HILLARY CLINTON'S NEW CRIMES WHICH HAPPEN ALL THE\nTIME. SOME FORMER PROSECUTORS HAVE\nEVEN SUGGESTED THAT THE COORDINATION BETWEEN THE PAY FOR\nPLAY STATE DEPARTMENT AND THE CLINTON FOUNDATION CONSTITUTE A\nCLEAR EXAMPLE OF RICO RACKETEERING, INFLUENCE CORRUPT\nORGANIZATION ENTERPRISE. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS\nREQUIRED TO APPOINT AN INDEPENDENT SPECIAL PROSECUTOR.\nBECAUSE IT HAS PROVEN ITSELF TO BE REALLY, SADLY, A POLITICAL\nARM OF THE WHITE HOUSE. >> SO M.J., TRUMP CALLING FOR A\nSPECIAL PROSECUTOR IN THE E-MAIL SCANDAL.\nTHAT'S NEW. >> THIS IS VERY HARSH RHETORIC\nWE'RE SEEING FROM DONALD TRUMP AGAINST CLINTON ON THE E-MAIL\nISSUES. I THINK IF YOU'RE A TRUMP\nSURROGATE OR A TRUMP AIDE OR EVEN HIS FORMER CAMPAIGN\nMANAGER, A NUMBER OF HIS EXAIDES, I THINK YOU SEE TRUMP\nBEHAVE THIS WAY TONIGHT, TAKE THIS KIND OF TONE AND YOU'RE\nWONDERING, WHERE WAS ALL OF THIS THIS SUMMER?\nYOU KNOW HIS AIDES AND CAMPAIGN ADVISORS HAVE WANTED SO BADLY\nFOR SO LONG FOR TRUMP TO REALLY FOCUS AND GET ON MESSAGE AND\nREALLY HIT CLINTON CONSISTENTLY ON THIS ISSUE THAT MAKES HER SO\nVULNERABLE AND THAT IS THE ISSUE OF TRUST AND THE E-MAIL ISSUE\nDIRECTLY FEEDS ON THAT. I THINK THE FACT THAT THE\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN IS EXPECTING POTENTIALLY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF\nNEW DOCUMENTS, SOME OF THEM MAY BE E-MAILS.\nWE JUST DON'T KNOW YET. THAT MAY BE RELEASED IN THE\nCOMING WEEKS IS OBVIOUSLY A BIG POLITICAL HEADACHE FOR THE\nCAMPAIGN. CLINTON UNLIKE TRUMP HAS BEEN\nQUITE FOCUSED AND ON MESSAGE IN TERMS OF TALKING ABOUT THE\nECONOMY, GOING AFTER TRUMP, PAINTING HIM AS TEMPERAMENTALLY\nUNFIT. AND SO IF THESE NEW DOCUMENTS\nARE RELEASED, CLEARLY THAT BECOMES A NEW DISTRACTION.\n>> DONALD TRUMP IS HITTING HILLARY CLINTON OVER THE\nFOUNDATION CALLING IT, QUOTE, THE MOST CORRUPT ENTERPRISE IN\nAMERICAN HISTORY, THAT'S A QUOTE FROM HIM.\nTHAT COMES AFTER THE FOUNDATION ANNOUNCED IF HILLARY CLINTON IS\nELECTED PRESIDENT THAT THE FORMER PRESIDENT WOULD STOP\nACCEPTING PAID SPEECHES AND THEY'D STOP ACCEPTING FOREIGN\nAND CORPORATE DONATIONS. HOW IS THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN\nRESPONDING TO THE ATTACKS FROM TRUMP ABOUT CORRUPTION AND\nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST? >> WELL, WHAT THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN IS SAYING THEY HAVE DONE UNPRECEDENTED DISCLOSURE OF\nCLINTON FOUNDATION DONORS. YOU ALSO HAD HER CAMPAIGN\nCHAIRMAN JOHN PODESTA COMING OUT TRYING TO TURN THE ISSUE BACK ON\nTRUMP SAYING WE NEED TO KNOW A LOT MORE ABOUT HIS BUSINESS\nDEALS AND TIES TO CHINA AND THE KREMLIN AND CERTAINLY THERE'S A\nLOT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT TRUMP'S BUSINESS DEALINGS.\nI THINK THE LARGER POINTS DEMOCRATS ARE ASKING IS WHY\nDIDN'T THE CLINTONS DO THIS, MAKE THE ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT\nTAKING MONEY FROM FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS A LONG TIME AGO?\nTHIS ISSUE CONTINUES TO HAUNT HER CAMPAIGN.\nTHERE'S NOW THE OVERLAY OF THESE E-MAILS ABOUT THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION WITH THE E-MAIL SCANDAL, AND A LOT OF VOTERS OUT\nTHERE JUST KIND OF SEE A BIG MESS AND DON'T UNDERSTAND, YOU\nKNOW, WHY THIS IS SO COMPLEX AND IT CERTAINLY HURTS CLINTON WITH\nTHOSE HONESTY AND TRUSTWORTHINESS NUMBERS.\nYOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE A CAMPAIGN WITH AN OCTOBER\nSURPRISE CERTAINLY AND THE E-MAIL SCANDAL CONTINUES TO BE\nTHIS DRIP, DRIP, DRIP THAT HER CAMPAIGN HAS TO DEAL WITH.\n>> BEFORE I LET YOU GO, I HAVE TO ASK YOU THIS, I WANT TO GET\nYOUR TAKE ON WHAT WE'RE SEEING WITH TRUMP SURROGATES RAISING\nQUESTIONS OVER HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH.\nRUDY GIULIANI, THE FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR, SAYS PEOPLE\nSHOULD GO ONLINE AND GOOGLE HER NAME AND THE WORD \"ILLNESS.\"\nWHAT'S GOING ON HERE? >> I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE\nCLEAREST DEMONSTRATIONS WE'VE SEEN SO FAR OF WHAT THE TONE\nWILL BE OF THE NEW DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN.\nAS WE ALL KNOW, HE HAD A BIG SHAKEUP LAST WEEK BRINGING IN\nBANNON AND OTHER LEADERS. I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE A\nBARE-KNUCKLED FIGHT ALL THE WAY TO NOVEMBER.\nTHE FACT THEY'RE BRINGING UP ISSUES LIKE HER HEALTH WHICH IS\nSOMETHING YOU SEE TALKED ABOUT MOST OFTEN ON DRUDGE OR, YOU\nKNOW, CONSPIRACY THEORY WEBSITES, THAT JUST SHOWS YOU\nHOW TOUGH THIS CAMPAIGN IS GOING TO BE AND I THINK HILLARY\nCLINTON HAS TRIED AT VARIOUS POINTS IN THE CAMPAIGN TO KIND\nOF DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE WITH A SENSE OF HUMOR AND THAT MAY BE\nTHE WAY THAT SHE DOES FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK.\n>> IT'S INTERESTING TO HAVE ESPECIALLY SOMEONE, M.J., LIKE\nRUDY GIULIANI DOING THAT CONSIDERING ALL THE CONSPIRACY\nTHEORIES AND WHAT YOU SEE ONLINE ABOUT 9/11 AND THOSE SORTS OF\nTHINGS THAT HE'S PUSHING PEOPLE TO WEBSITES WHERE THINGS THAT\nMAY NOT BE TRUE. >> WELL, I THINK IT'S SO\nIMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT RUDY GIULIANI HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF\nDONALD TRUMP'S MOST PROMINENT AND RESPECTED BY MANY REPUBLICAN\nLEADERS, ONE OF HIS MOST PROMINENT SURROGATES AND THE\nFACT RUDY GIULIANI IS OUT THERE TELLING PEOPLE, ENCOURAGING\nPEOPLE TO GO AND GOOGLE HILLARY CLINTON AND ILLNESS, WHEN I\nTHINK A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK GIULIANI COULD BE TALKING ABOUT\nNATIONAL SECURITY, WHY HE BELIEVES DONALD TRUMP IS THE\nONLY PERSON THAT CAN KEEP THE COUNTRY SAFE.\nCERTAINLY YOU TALK TO A LOT OF REPUBLICAN STRATEGISTS AND\nREPUBLICAN LEADERS, THEY DON'T THINK THIS IS THE BEST USE OF A\nSURROGATE LIKE RUDY GIULIANI.",

THAT'S NOT HELPFUL.\nON THAT STAMINA PART, YOU KNOW, I THINK HILLARY CLINTON WOULD\nPUT HER STAMINA UP AGAINST DONALD TRUMP'S ANY DAY OF THE\nWEEK AND TWICE ON SUNDAY. LET'S REMEMBER THAT LAST YEAR,\nHE COMPLAINED ABOUT A THREE-HOUR DEBATE.\nHE WAS SWEATING, HE WAS HANGING ON TO THE PODIUM.\nHILLARY CLINTON WENT THROUGH 11 HOURS OF TESTIMONY BEFORE\nCONGRESS. LET'S SEE HIM DO THAT.\n>> STAY WITH US. WANT TO GET THE PANEL'S TAKE ON\nWHAT APPEARS TO BE A CHANGE IN DONALD TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION\nPOLICY AND CALL TO DEPORT 11 MILLION PEOPLE.\nTHIS JUST HAPPENED MOMENTS AGO. WE WILL TELL YOU ABOUT IT NEXT.",

NOW, AS HE WAS SAYING THIS,\nCHEERS OF \"LOCK HER UP\" BROKE OUT RIGHT HERE IN THIS ARENA.\nTHAT'S A GOOD INDICATION TO YOU OF HOW MOVING THIS IS TO THE\nREPUBLICAN BASE BUT IT'S ALSO THE KIND OF THING THAT THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN BELIEVES COULD RESONATE WITH INDEPENDENT VOTERS, VOTERS\nWHO BELIEVE THE CLINTONS AREN'T TRUSTWORTHY OR REALLY BUY INTO\nTHE NOTION THE CLINTONS HAVE PLAYED BY THEIR OWN RULES.\n>> TALK MORE ABOUT DONALD TRUMP YET AGAIN KIND OF SPEAKING TO\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS, NOT NECESSARILY IN THAT HALL, BUT\nWHO MAY HAVE BEEN WATCHING. WHAT DID HE SAY?\n>> Reporter: THIS HAS BEEN A RELATIVELY NEW OVERTURE FROM\nTRUMP FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS, TRYING TO DO THIS OUTREACH\nTO BLACK VOTERS. HE CAUGHT A LOT OF CRITICISM\nEVEN FROM MEMBERS OF HIS OWN PARTY WHO LOOKED AT HIS POLLING\nWHICH IS ABYSMAL WITH AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS AND\nESSENTIALLY SAID HE WASN'T EVEN TRYING TO MAKE THE EFFORT.\nSO NOW WE ARE HEARING DONALD TRUMP ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL\nTRYING TO MAKE THE EFFORT BUT IT'S RAISING A FEW EYEBROWS BY\nHOW HE'S DOING IT. ESSENTIALLY SAYING THINGS CAN'T\nGET ANY WORSE. TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID.\n>> CRIME, ALL OF THE PROBLEMS TO THE AFRICAN-AMERICANS WHO I\nEMPLOY SO MANY, SO MANY PEOPLE, TO THE HISPANICS, TREMENDOUS\nPEOPLE. WHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO\nLOSE? GIVE ME A CHANCE.\nI'LL STRAIGHTEN IT OUT. I'LL BRING JOBS BACK.\nWE'LL BRING SPIRIT BACK. WE'LL GET RID OF THE CRIME.\nYOU'LL BE ABLE TO WALK DOWN THE STREET WITHOUT GETTING SHOT.\nRIGHT NOW, YOU WALK DOWN THE STREET, YOU GET SHOT.\n>> Reporter: NOW, HIS CRITICS ARE ALREADY SEIZING ON TWITTER\nON THAT LAST LINE, YOU WALK DOWN THE STREET AND YOU GET SHOT.\nANDERSON, AS YOU ALLUDED TO, IT'S WORTH NOTING WHEN DONALD\nTRUMP COMES TO ARENAS LIKE THIS, HE CERTAINLY DOES DRAW A RAUCUS\nCROWD THAT IS DELIGHTED TO SEE HIM BUT VERY FEW\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN FACES IN THAT MIX.\n>> THANKS VERY MUCH. MORE ON THE REVELATIONS IN THE\nCLINTON E-MAIL STORY DONALD TRUMP LATCHED ON TO.\nJEFF ZELENY JOINS US WITH THE LATEST ON THAT.\nTHESE 15,000 E-MAILS AND E-MAIL ATTACHMENTS WE LEARNED ABOUT\nTODAY, WHAT DO THEY SHOW? >> WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT\nTHEY SAY BECAUSE FRANKLY WE HAVEN'T SEEN THEM YET.\nAS YOU SAID, THERE ARE 15,000 DOCUMENTS, MOST OF THEM, NOT ALL\nOF THEM, ARE E-MAILS. THESE WERE ALL DISCOVERED BY THE\nFBI DURING THEIR YEAR-LONG INVESTIGATION OF HER PRIVATE\nE-MAIL SERVER. THEY WERE TURNED OVER TO THE\nSTATE DEPARTMENT LAST MONTH BUT THE REASON THEY ARE BEING TALKED\nABOUT TODAY IS A FEDERAL JUDGE SHINED A SPOTLIGHT ON THEM WHEN\nHE SAID THEY SHOULD BE RELEASED AND RELEASED FASTER, STARTING\nNEXT MONTH, AFTER THE STATE DEPARTMENT REVIEWS THEM.\nYOU MAY WONDER WHY WE ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT HER E-MAILS.\nIT'S SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE THESE 15,000 WERE NOT TURNED OVER WHEN\nTHOSE 55,000 WERE TURNED OVER LAST YEAR, FOR WHATEVER REASON.\nWE DON'T KNOW THE REASON OF THAT.\nSO UNTIL WE SEE WHAT'S IN SOME OF THESE E-MAILS, THIS\nCONTROVERSY AND THESE QUESTIONS MAY CONTINUE.\n>> THESE E-MAILS, THE 15,000, THEY WERE LOOKED AT BY THE FBI\nBECAUSE IT WAS THE FBI WHO DISCOVERED THEM, AND THE FBI IS\nNOT BRINGING ANY CHARGES. SO I GUESS THEY DIDN'T THINK\nTHERE WAS ANY ILLEGALITY THERE. WHERE IS CLINTON NOW?\nSHE HASN'T REALLY HAD PUBLIC EVENTS FOR THE PAST FEW DAYS.\n>> SHE'S NOT BEEN CAMPAIGNING MUCH IN PUBLIC.\nSHE'S IN CALIFORNIA FOR A THREE-DAY FUND-RAISING SWING.\nIN FACT, THIS EVENING SHE'S DOING A ROUND OF LATE NIGHT TALK\nSHOWS. SHE WILL BE ON WITH JIMMY\nKIMMEL. SHE'S ALSO DOING SOME\nFUND-RAISING, BIG FUND-RAISING AT THE HOME OF MAGIC JOHNSON.\nTHE FINAL TWO WEEKS OF AUGUST ALL ABOUT RAISING MONEY\nSPECIFICALLY TO FUND TV ADS. HER CAMPAIGN ANNOUNCED AN $80\nMILLION STRATEGY FOR THE FINAL STRETCH IN ALL TYPES OF\nBATTLEGROUND STATES, TRYING TO KEEP THE FOCUS ON DONALD TRUMP\nAND HIS TEMPERAMENT. OF COURSE, THESE E-MAILS AND\nOTHER THINGS HAVE KEPT SOME OF THE SPOTLIGHT ON HER CAMPAIGN\nUNCOMFORTABLY AS WELL. >> JEFF, THANKS VERY MUCH.\nBACK WITH THE PANEL. JOINING US ALSO IS ALEX BURNS,\nNATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER FOR THE \"NEW YORK TIMES.\"\nALEX, LET'S START WITH YOU. HOW BIG A PROBLEM ARE THE NEW\nDOCUMENTS? THE FBI HAS LOOKED AT THEM\nALREADY BUT IT CERTAINLY CONTINUES KIND OF THE DRUM BEAT,\nTHE DRIP, DRIP OF STORIES ABOUT THESE E-MAILS.\n>> ABSOLUTELY. I THINK THE ONLY HONEST ANSWER\nFROM A REPORTER'S PERSPECTIVE IS WE DON'T KNOW HOW BIG A PROBLEM\nTHEY ARE GOING TO BE FOR HILLARY CLINTON BECAUSE WE THE PUBLIC\nDON'T ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT'S IN THEM YET.\nPRESUMABLY THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN MUST HAVE SOME SENSE OF WHAT IS\nLURKING OUT THERE BUT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN PARTICULARLY DETAILED\nIN DESCRIBING WHAT OTHER REVELATIONS MIGHT BE YET TO\nCOME. CLEARLY, ON A WEEK LIKE THIS, AS\nJEFF WAS DESCRIBING, WHEN HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN MOSTLY\nOUT OF PUBLIC VIEW, WHEN SHE HAS BEEN TRYING TO TAKE A STEP BACK\nAND LET THE HEAT STAY ON DONALD TRUMP, THIS ISSUE COMING BACK TO\nTHE FOREGROUND IS OBVIOUSLY NOT HELPFUL FOR HER.\n>> MARIA, EVEN THOUGH THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, IT'S THE\nQUESTION WHICH THE RNC ASKED WHICH IS A COMPLETELY VALID\nQUESTION, WHICH IS IF AS PRESIDENT, HILLARY CLINTON SAYS\nTHE CLINTON FOUNDATION IS NOT GOING TO ACCEPT FOREIGN\nDONATIONS, WHY WAS IT OKAY FOR HER WHEN SHE WAS SECRETARY OF\nSTATE FOR THE CLINTON FOUNDATION TO ACCEPT FOREIGN DONATIONS?\n>> I THINK AGAIN, I THINK JAMES WAS TALKING ABOUT THIS EARLIER,\nWHEN SHE WAS DOING HER BUSINESS OF SECRETARY OF STATE, THEY\nTRIED TO MAKE -- DO A FIREWALL. IT'S DIFFICULT, THOUGH,\nOBVIOUSLY, WHEN THEY KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE IN THE CLINTON\nWORLD, THE CLINTON WORLD, SO MANY PEOPLE IN THE SECRETARY OF\nSTATE WORLD. WHAT WE SAW WITH THE E-MAILS\nTHAT CAME OUT IS SOME FODDER ABOUT PEOPLE GETTING IN TOUCH\nWITH THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, TALKING ABOUT THE CROWN PRINCE,\nBUT ULTIMATELY, THAT MEETING IF IT HAPPENED, IT HAPPENED THROUGH\nOFFICIAL CHANNELS. >> BUT AN E-MAIL WENT TO HUMA\nABEDIN SAYING THIS MAN IS A GOOD FRIEND OF OURS, PRESUMABLY\nMEANING HE GAVE A LOT OF MONEY, COULD THE SECRETARY MEET WITH\nHIM. >> HERE'S THE OTHER THING.\nMY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT E-MAIL WAS SENT AS A PERSONAL ASSISTANT\nTO PRESIDENT CLINTON, NOT AS SOMEBODY WHO WORKED FOR THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION. THIS IS WHERE THE DIFFICULTY\nLIES. PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHERE THOSE\nBARRIERS ARE. AT THE END OF THE DAY, WHAT THE\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN SAID FROM THE BEGINNING AND THEY STAND BY\nTHIS, IS THEY WANT EVERY SINGLE E-MAIL OUT THERE.\nJUST TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THESE 15,000, YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW THE\nFBI AND COMEY HAD ALREADY LOOKED AT THIS AND THAT IS IMPORTANT\nFOR THE VIEWERS TO UNDERSTAND, AND HE ACTUALLY SAID IN\nANNOUNCING THE FBI FINDINGS, HE SAID THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE\nTHAT THE E-MAILS THAT WERE FOUND WERE QUOTE, INTENTIONALLY\nDELETED IN AN EFFORT TO CONCEAL THEM.\nTHAT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT REPUBLICANS\nARE TRYING TO POUNCE ON. AGAIN, NOTHING HAS BEEN FOUND,\nNO SMOKING GUN, ABOUT ANYTHING. THIS SEEMS TO BE THE ONLY THING\nTHEY HAVE GOING AGAINST HER. YES, IT WAS A SELF-INFLICTED\nWOUND. IF THIS HADN'T HAPPENED PERHAPS\nSHE WOULD BE 15 TO 20 POINTS AHEAD INSTEAD OF FIVE TO TEN.\n>> IT'S VERY SIMPLE. HILLARY CLINTON SAT BEFORE\nCONGRESS AND SAID UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY I TURNED OVER ALL\nWORK RELATED E-MAILS AND HERE'S HOW WE DID IT.\n>> SHE DID COUCH THE PHRASE TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE.\n>> THAT'S RIGHT. SHE SAID WE LOOKED THROUGH EVERY\nSINGLE E-MAIL, MY LAWYERS DID AND TURNED OVER ALL THE WORK\nRELATED ONES. IF YOU ARE LOOKING THROUGH EVERY\nSINGLE E-MAIL HOW DID YOU SOMEHOW MISS 15,000?\nTHAT IS COMPLETELY STRANGE. IT WAS UNTRUTHFUL WHAT SHE SAID.\nNOT ONLY THAT, SHE SAID AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT THEY HAD\nNOTHING TO DO WITH THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\n>> THEY DIDN'T. >> WE FIND OUT TODAY THAT A\nCLINTON FOUNDATION OFFICIAL ON CHERYL MILLS' VOICE MAIL\nREFERRED TO OUR BOSS, HILLARY CLINTON.\nA CLINTON FOUNDATION OFFICIAL SAID HER BOSS WAS IN FACT\nHILLARY CLINTON. >> THAT WAS RHETORICAL, COME ON.\n>> I UNDERSTAND THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO DEFEND HER ON THIS.\nTHE WHOLE THING ABOUT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, IT WAS THIS\nWEB OF RUBBING SHOULDERS WITH BILL CLINTON, IF YOU GO AND YOU\nDONATE MONEY, THERE WAS A WHOLE SORT OF -- IT WASN'T JUST PEOPLE\nWANTED TO DO GOOD WORKS. I WAS ALSO ABOUT CONNECTIONS TO\nTHE CLINTONS. >> TODAY, THE CAMPAIGN MANAGER\nOF HILLARY CLINTON SAID IF SHE'S ELECTED PRESIDENT WE WILL STOP\nTAKING FOREIGN DONATIONS. THEY COULD STOP TAKING THEM\nTODAY. FURTHERMORE, THEY SAID IF SHE'S\nELECTED PRESIDENT SHE WILL STEP DOWN FROM THE FOUNDATION.\nSHE COULD STEP DOWN RIGHT THIS VERY MINUTE.\nTHEY GIVE THIS CONVOLUTED ANSWER OF SHE'S REALLY TIED INTO A LOT\nOF DIFFERENT THINGS. >> YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT BILL\nCLINTON. >> YOU COULD STEP OUT TODAY.\n>> THAT WASN'T HER. >> BILL CLINTON COULD STEP OUT\nTODAY FROM THE FOUNDATION. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITNESS.\nTHAT COULD BE DONE WITH A PIECE OF PAPER.\nTHEY CHOOSE NOT TO DO IT. BOTTOM LINE IS THE NOTION OF A\nPOTENTIAL IMPROPRIETY IS WHAT HAS HILLARY CLINTON'S SUPPORT OF\nTRUSTWORTHINESS AT 11% WITH AMERICAN PUBLIC.\n>> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF JAMES CARVILLE'S ARGUMENT THAT\nMILLIONS OF PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO LOW COST HIV DRUGS THEY WILL\nDIE WITHOUT AND -- >> THAT'S WONDERFUL.\nEXCEPT THAT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION HAS SPENT ONLY 2.9%\nOF THEIR MONEY ON DIRECT SERVICES.\nTHE MAJORITY OF THEIR MONEY IS OVERHEAD.\n>> THAT'S MISLEADING. >> THE HIV STUFF, MY\nUNDERSTANDING, I MAY BE WRONG, IS THEY ALSO NEGOTIATED --\n>> IT'S 89%. >> AT THE SAME TIME, THERE ARE\nALSO QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN HAITI, ALSO\nQUESTIONS ABOUT UKRAINIAN AND RUSSIAN THINGS.\nTHERE IS ALL KINDS OF ISSUES GOING ON HERE.\nTHE REASON WHY BILL CLINTON ISN'T STEPPING DOWN RIGHT NOW IS\nBECAUSE THEY USE THE CLINTON FOUNDATION TO TRAVEL ALL OVER\nTHE WORLD ON PEOPLE'S PRIVATE JETS AND THEY FUNNEL THINGS\nTHROUGH THERE. IT'S SO PAY TO PLAY.\nON THAT SAME 990 FORM, $20 MILLION WAS SPENT ON TRAVEL AND\nEXPENSES. MORE MONEY THAN SPENT ON THESE\nWONDERFUL PROGRAMS THEY ALLEGEDLY DO.\nIT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO LOOK AT THIS AND WHEN YOU SEE\nTHERE WAS ANOTHER THING REVEALED TODAY, THERE WERE 150 VOICE MAIL\nMESSAGES LEFT BETWEEN A CLINTON FOUNDATION DIRECTOR AND ONE OF\nHILLARY CLINTON'S RIGHT HAND PEOPLE.\n150 MESSAGES IN LIKE A YEAR AND A HALF.\nTHEY ARE SO IN BED WITH THESE GUYS.\nIT'S UNETHICAL. >> I THINK, I KNOW YOU CAN\nAPPRECIATE THIS FROM HAVING BEEN A FORMER HILL STAFFER AS WELL.\nLET ME USE THIS AS AN EXAMPLE. I WORKED FOR THE CDC THREE YEARS\nAGO. THE OTHER POINT IS CONGRESSMAN\nTHOMPSON FOR FOUR YEARS BEFORE THAT.\nI STILL CALL CONGRESSMAN THOMPSON BOSS OR THE BOSS.\nI SIT ON THE CDC BOARD AND YOU KNOW, CONGRESSMAN, I SIT ON THAT\nBOARD, I CALL HIM BIG BOSS. MY CONGRESSMAN CLEAVER, WORK\nDAD. GOING BACK TO --\n>> HUMA ABEDIN HAD FOUR DIFFERENT JOBS.\n>> LET HER FINISH. >> I UNDERSTAND THE OPTICS.\nI'M NOT GOING TO ARGUE THE OPTICS WITH YOU.\nTHEY ARE DAMNING. I WILL GIVE YOU THAT.\nIT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY HAVING SAT IN THESE PRIVILEGED SEATS\nWHAT THE REAL IS. >> THE FLIPSIDE OF THAT --\n>> IT'S WHEN YOU DONATE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OR\nBETWEEN $5 MILLION AND $10 MILLION TO THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION AND GET PUT AHEAD OF THE LINE TO HAVE A MEETING WITH\nTHE SECRETARY OF STATE, THAT'S PROBLEMATIC.\n[ SPEAKING SIMULTANEOUSLY ] >> DON'T TALK OVER EACH OTHER.\nNO ONE WILL LISTEN. THE FLIPSIDE OF THIS IS THIS\nDOES ALLOW THE CLINTON FOLKS TO COME BACK AND SAY LOOK, WE ARE\nTRYING TO BE AS TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE, WE RELEASED, THE ONLY\nREASON PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT WHAT MONEY'S RAISED BY THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS TRANSPARENT.\nDONALD TRUMP HASN'T RELEASED HIS TAX RETURNS.\nHE'S NOT TRANSPARENT. >> SHE SHOULD NOT TRY TO MAKE A\nTRANSPARENCY ARGUMENT HERE. SHE DELETED HALF OF HER E-MAILS,\n15,000 DOCUMENTS WERE DISCOVERED NOT BY CLINTON BEING GRATUITOUS\nSAYING I WILL PUT THESE FORWARD FOR THE SAKE OF TRANSPARENCY.\nTHEY WERE DISCOVERED BY THE FBI WHO FOUND THEM VIA OTHER ROUTES.\nSHE IS THE LAST PERSON TO MAKE A TRANSPARENCY ARGUMENT.\nYOU KNOW IT'S DEVASTATING TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC SHE PUT OUR\nNATIONAL SECRETS IN A VERY PERILOUS POSITION, SETTING UP\nTHIS PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER WHERE YOU COULD HAVE POTENTIALLY PUT\nCIA ASSETS IN HARM'S WAY. >> YOU KNOW, THIS IS A POINT I\nTHINK YOU CAN'T MAKE TOO OFTEN. THIS IS ONE OF THESE SITUATIONS\nTHAT MAKES OTHER REPUBLICANS LIKE THE TED CRUZES AND JEB\nBUSHES OF THE WORLD SAY MY GOODNESS HOW DID WE NOMINATE THE\nONE GUY IN THE WORLD, IF IT WERE ANY OTHER REPUBLICAN THIS WOULD\nBE A SLAM DUNK OF AN ARGUMENT TO MAKE.\nTARA MAKES IT VERY EFFECTIVELY. TRUMP IS SO EXPOSED ON THE OTHER\nSIDE OF IT THAT YOU DO WONDER WHETHER HE CAN SUSTAIN IT OVER\nTWO AND A HALF MONTHS. >> DREW GRIFFIN HAS NEW\nREPORTING ON THE FOUNDATION AND TRANSPARENCY IN AN IN-DEPTH\nREPORT NEXT.

IT IS OVER IN THAT REGARD AND\nIT IS OVER IN THE SENSE THAT WE WILL FORGET ABOUT IT WHEN\nWE FIND OUT THEY DID NOTHING WRONG AND WE ARE ALL GOING TO\nSEE HIM AS SOMEBODY WHO WILL DO SOMETHING.\n>> AT THE LEAST IT WAS LIKE THE OTHER AMERICAN AND THEY\nSAID ALL OF THESE PEOPLE IN SOUTH AMERICA ARE CROOKS.\n>> THEY CLEARLY DID SOMETHING WRONG OR HE WOULDN'T BE UH\nAPOLOGETIC. IF HE GOT SHOOK DOWN BY THE\nPOLICE HE WOULD TELL US THAT AND WE WOULD BELIEVE THEM LIKE\nTHEY DID WHEN THEY FIRST CAME OUT WITH THE STORY.\nWE SAID OH OUR GOOD SWIMMERS GOT SHUTDOWN BY THIS CORRUPT\nPOLICE DEPARTMENT. >> WHEN EVERYBODY WAS WORRIED\nABOUT THE U.S. >> AS JOHN POINTED OUT HE IS\n32. HE IS NOT A FRAT KID.\nHE IS ACTING LIKE A JERK IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY AND THAT'S\nWHAT HAPPENS. >> JOHN, I HAVE A QUESTION.\nLOCHTE WAS OF COURSE A GLOBAL BRAND AMBASSADOR FOR THE\nGENTLE LASER HAIR REMOVAL. I THOUGHT AMBASSADORSHIPS WERE\nFOR LIFE. LIKE JOHN BOLTON, DO WE HAVE\nTO STILL CALL HIM AMBASSADOR? >> WE SHOULD CALL HIM\nAMBASSADOR AND THEN WE SHOULD SUBJECT PEOPLE WHO LIKE ME IF\nI DO SOMETHING WRONG TO GENTLE LASER HAIR REMOVAL WHICH I\nTHINK WOULD BE A TORTURE. IF YOU HAD ANY IDEA HOW MANY\n-- HOW MUCH HAIR I HAVE ON MY BACK AND ON MY CHEST AND YOU\nPUT ME ON ONE OF THOSE TABLES I WOULD TELL YOU ANYTHING.\nI WOULD GIVE YOU MY ATM NUMBER.\n>> THE KID REFER TO THIS AS TMI.\n>> IT IS 3:00 IN THE MORNING. >> SOMETIMES IT DOES FEEL LIKE\nDONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN IS BEING RUN BY A 12-YEAR-OLD.\nIN COLORADO IT IS. HE IS THE CO CHAIR OF THE\nCAMPAIGN IN ONE OF COLORADO'S MOST POPULOUS COUNTIES.\nTHE LOCAL DENVER STATION KDVR TALKED WITH THE YOUNG LAD.\n>> THEY ARE RELYING ON 12-YEAR-OLD WESTIN LYMER.\n>> LAST YEAR AT KIDS KIDS WOULD BULLY ME.\n>> HE ADMITS SITTING BEHIND THE BIG DESK MAY NOT BE THE\nCOOLEST THING TO DO, BUT HE LOVES IT NOW AND HOPES TO\nINSPIRE OTHERS. >> GET INVOLVED.\nTHAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS GET INVOLVED.\n>> HIS MOTHER IS IN CHARGE, BUT SHE HANDED OVER THE\nMAJORITY OF THE DUTIES TO HER SON TO TEACH HIM\nRESPONSIBILITY AND IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HER BEING\nLAZY AND HATING WORK. THEY SAY HE HAS NO INTEREST IN\nRUNNING FOR OFFICE SOME DAY. >> 2040 WATCH FOR ME.\nIVAN AND BARON TRUMP, WATCH ME AND I WILL TAKE YOU AS MY\nRUNNING MATE. >> IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THIS\nKID IS THE MOST COMPETENT PERSON WORKING FOR TRUMP?\n>> I THINK HE SHOULD STAR IN THE SECOND SEASON OF STRANGER\nTHINGS. >> ABSOLUTELY.\n>> AS THE ALIEN. >> HE COULD BE 12?\n>> I GUESS SO. >> DAVE, ARE YOU, A, SURPRISED\nTHAT THE CAMPAIGN WOULD PUT THEIR HOPES ON WINNING A\nCRUCIAL SWING STATE ON SOME KID OR B, NOT IN THE LEAST BIT\nSURPRISED. IF EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED\nOVER THE L.A. YEAR MAKES SENSE IF YOU FOUND OUT IT WAS COMING\nFROM A 12-YEAR-OLD. WELL NOW I GET IT.\nAND SOMEHOW AMERICA IS AT A STATE WHERE THE TWELD-YEAR-OLD\nSEEMS LIKE A REASONABLE OPTION.\nTHAT KID -- I DON'T WANT TO INSULT A CHILD, BUT I HAVE\nNEVER BEEN SO TURNED OFF BY A KID.\nYOU HAVE THE POLITICIAN QUALITY WE ALL HATE AT 12.\nWHO RAISED HIM? >> OUT OF CONTEXT I HAVE NEVER\nBEEN SO TURNED OFF BY A KID. IT DOESN'T SOUND GOOD.\n>> I GUESS IT WAS THE I'M NEVER.\n>> IS THIS A MOM FORCING HER KID TO DO WORK FOR HER?\nAND DO YOU AS YOU USUALLY SAY, GOOD FOR HER?\n>> GOOD FOR THOSE LOAFERS OUT THERE.\n>> LISTEN, HE HAS TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL.\nWHAT A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR HIM.\nMITT ROMNEY WON THAT COUNTY BY 53%, THE FOURTH BIGGEST COUNTY\nIN THE STATE. LISTEN, TRUMP HAS TO GIVE HIM\nA LITTLE SHOUTOUT. >> I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE.\nDO YOU THINK THIS WILL HELP HIM WITH THAT?\n>> I FEEL TERRIBLE FOR HIM. HE IS BAD.\nCLEARLY THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH HIM.\nI DON'T WANT TO GO INTO DETAILS, BUT I DON'T THINK HE\nTAKES CLASSES WITH KIDS. I DON'T KNOW WHO IS BULLYING\nHIM, BUT I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH HIM.\n>> HE HAS A PERFECT MODEL IN DONALD TRUMP AND IF ANYBODY\nSAID ANYTHING TO HIM YOU CAN SAY GET HIM OUT OF HERE.\nI WILL PAY FOR YOUR LEGAL FEES.\n>> HE HAS AN ENTIRELY NEW APPROACH AND HE ASSIGNS PEOPLE\nIN SCHOOL TO BEAT UP THE PERSON MEAN TO HIM.\n>> IF HE HAS MONEY HE IS GOLDEN.\n>> BULLIES ARE NOT DOING A GOOD ENOUGH JOB BULLYING HIM.\nHE STILL THINKS THIS JOB IS WAY TOO COOL.\n>> TO BE FAIR, THERE WAS SOMETHING KIND OF AMAZING AND\nPOLISHED ABOUT HIM THAT DID NOT GIVE OFF THE WHIF OF THE\nTORMENTED INTROVERT. >> HE IS BEING ENCOURAGED BY\nSOMEBODY. >> MAYBE HE HAS BEEN ON-LINE\nBULLIED. WE CAN ALL AGREE ON THAT.\nIT LOOKS LIKE ALL OF THE CONSPIRACY THEE REARS ABOUT\nHILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH ARE TRUE.\nSHE HAS A SERIOUS COLON PROBLEM.\nCOLIN POWELL THAT IS. ACCORDING TO THE \"NEW YORK\nTIMES\" SHE SAID SHE DECIDED TO USE A PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER\nBECAUSE POWELL TOLD HER AT A DINNER PARTY THAT'S WHAT HE\nDID AS SECRETARY OF STATE. POWELL'S OFFICE DENIES IT\nSAYING HE HAS NO RECOLLECTION OF THE DINNER CONVERSATION.\nNOW POWELL IS SPEAKING OUT TELLING PEOPLE MAGAZINE THAT\nHER PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO PIN IT ON ME.\nTHE TRUTH IS SHE WAS USING THE PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER BEFORE I\nSENT HER A MEMO TELLING HER WHAT I DID.\nDID CLINTON UH WALKEN THE SLEEPING GIANT?\nI DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. >> HE IS VERY POPULAR AND A\nLOT OF PEOPLE GIVE HIM CREDIBILITY.\nIF YOU ARE FORCED TO SAY DO YOU BELIEVE IN HILLARY CLINTON?\nTHEY SAY OH, POWELL. IT WAS A YEAR AFTER HE STARTED\nUSING THE E-MAIL MY PRESUMPTION IS BETWEEN TRUMP\nAND HELL RE-- HILLARY HE WOULD VOTE FOR HILLARY.\nFOR HIM TO SAY A, I HAVE NO RECOLLECTION AND B SHE TRIED\nTO USE ME AS A SHIELD, THERE IS NO REASON TO DISBELIEVE\nHIM. HE HAS NO REASON.\nHE IS NOT IN A FIGHT WITH HER.\n>> IT IS EVEN MORE SO. HE DOES HAVE A DOG IN THE\nFIGHT AND IT IS HER. THAT'S HOW EGREGIOUSLY HE IS\nLYING. HE TRASHED THE BUSH\nADMINISTRATION. HE CAME OUT AND TRASHED TRUMP\nPUBLICLY. IF ANYTHING HE IS SIDING\nTOWARD HILLARY CLINTON. >> BUT ALSO THIS SEEMS LIKE AN\nEASILY DISPROVED LIE ON THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN'S PART WHICH\nSEEMS UNLIKE THEM. >> SHE DIDN'T COME OUT AND SAY\nIT. WE KNOW OF IT BECAUSE OF THE\nFBI'S THREE-HOUR CONVERSATION WITH HER.\nBUT SHE IS NOT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL EVERY TIME SOMEBODY\nFLINGS IT HER WAY. OH, COLIN POWELL TOLD ME TO DO\nTHIS. >> I DEFINITELY HEARD --\n>> THEY USED THAT AS PRECEDENT.\n>> SHE WAS NOT THE ONLY SECRETARY OF STATE.\n>> DID YOU HEAR WHAT HE DID? HE HAD TO GO IN THE OTHER ROOM\nAND ASK GEORGE W. BUSH TO NOT USE THE PHONE.\n>> THERE IS NO ONE UNDER 30 THAT WILL EVEN UNDERSTAND\nTHAT. >> CONDOLEEZZA RICE IS AT THE\nSAME DINNER AND SHE SAID EARLIER TODAY THAT SHE HAS NO\nRECOLLECTION OF THAT CONVERSATION TAKING PLACE.\nSHE IS A LIAR AND SHE LIED AND SHE LIED TO THE FBI.\nNOW THE QUESTION IS IF SHE LIED TO THE FBI CAN SHE\nPROVE -- CAN ANYONE PROVE SHE LIED AND DOES HER LIFE COUNT\nAS SOMETHING PRO-JURIOUS. HE WILL PROSECUTE HER FOR\nLYING AND SHE LIED. SHE LIED AND EVERYONE T.O.\nSHOULD SAY SHE LIED AND PROBABLY BY OCTOBER SHE WILL\nBE 10 POINTS AHEAD AND GOING I LIED, I LIED.\n>> THAT GETS TO THE KEY QUESTION HERE.\nHE IS THE ONLY ONE -- IF HE DIDN'T ACKNOWLEDGE THIS WE\nWOULDN'T BE TALKING ABOUT IT. PEOPLE HAVE MENTIONED IT FOR\nMONTHS AND IT HAS GONE UNNOTICED .\n>> FBI WENT TO CONGRESS AND SOMEBODY IN CONGRESS LEAKED\nTHE FACT THAT SHE SAID COLIN POWELL TOLD HER TO SET UP THE\nPRIVATE SERVER AND THAT'S HOW IT HAPPENED.\n>> HER PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING IT FOR MONTHS.\n>> NOBODY SAID COLIN POWELL. ANYWAY, I THINK HE HAS GOT NO\nREASON TO BE HANGING HER OUT TO DRY.\nHE HUNG HER OUT TO DRY. THAT'S WHAT IS IMPORTANT.\n ALL OF THIS TIME WHAT SHE DOES IS SHE TELLS THE LIES IN\nTHEORY THEPGING NOTHING WILL COME -- THINKING NOTHING WILL\nCOME OUT. >> THEY DID REFERENCE OTHER\n-- >> THE DIFFERENCE IS THEY WERE\nBRINGING THESE PEOPLE UP AS PRECEDENT AND NOW IT HAS MOVED\nTO -- HE TOLD ME TO DO IT. >> EVERYTHING HAS BEEN A LIE.\n>> IT IS TIME TO TAKE A BREAK.\nWHAT HAPPENS AFTER YOU SPEND ONE YEAR ON THE RED PLANET?\nAPPARENTLY YOU OPEN YOUR DOOR AND FIND OUT YOU WERE IN\nHAWAII THE WHOLE TIME.

THE GOVERNOR OFFERED PRAISE FOR\nDONALD TRUMP FOR CHANGING HIS PLANS TO TOUR THE STATE ON\nFRIDAY. >> WAS IT A GOOD THING THAT HE\nCAME DOWN? >> I THINK, YEAH, FOR THE\nREASONS THAT I STATED EARLIER BECAUSE IT HELPED TO SHINE A\nSPOTLIGHT ON LOUISIANA AND ON THE DIRE SITUATION THAT WE HAVE\nHERE THAT IT WAS HELPFUL. >> SO EBONY, ALSO THE LIEUTENANT\nGOVERNOR WAS ON TV TODAY SAYING HE WAS HAPPY DONALD TRUMP CAME.\nHE WOULD HAVE WELCOMED PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD HE COME PRIOR TO THIS\nJUST TO GET THE EYEBALLS ON THE AREA, AND HE SAID IN MANY CASES\nIN MANY REASONS THAT THIS IS WORSE THAN KATRINA BECAUSE OF\nTHE VASTNESS OF THE FLOODING. >> YEAH.\nI WAS IN LOUISIANA DURING KATRINA, ERIC, AND CERTAINLY\nTHIS AREA THAT GOT HIT IS NOT USED TO AND ACCUSTOMED TO THIS\nTYPE OF FLOODING SO THAT MADE IT VERY DIFFERENT.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE WERE QUESTIONING I SAW OVER THE WEEKEND TRUMP'S\nMOTIVATIONS. IS HE DOING THIS FOR A PHOTO OP.\nWE SEE NOW THAT THE GOVERNOR SAID THANK YOU FOR COMING.\nI ACTUALLY DON'T CARE, ERIC, ABOUT THE PURITY OF DONALD\nTRUMP'S INTENTIONS ON THIS. HERE'S WHY.\nHE'LL BE ACCOUNTABLE TO THAT TO SOMEONE FAR GREATER THAN ME AND\nYOU. WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT\nEYEBALLS WERE ON LOUISIANA BECAUSE THIS STORY HAS BEEN\nOVERSHADOWED BY THE OLYMPICS AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT'S GOING ON.\nMY FIRST HUSBAND WHO'S A MOTHER OF THREE, ALL OF HER CONTENTS OF\nHER HOME ARE ON THE FRONT YARD RIGHT NOW.\nIT'S IMPORTANT THAT TRUMP WENT AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT\nPRESIDENT OBAMA -- HE SHOULD HAVE WENT.\nI'M GLAD HE'S GOING TOMORROW BUT HE SHOULD HAVE GONE.\nHERE'S THE REASON WHY. IT'S GOOD THAT HE'S BEEN ON THE\nPHONE AND OPERAING BEHIND THE SCENES BUT WHEN YOU ARE THE\nLEADER, PEOPLE FOLLOW YOUR LEAD. WHEN YOU SHOW CONCERN AND YOU'RE\nVISIBLY AROUND THIS ISSUE, IT UPS THE ANTE TO THE LEVEL OF\nAWARENESS AND PARTICIPATION OF THE PEOPLE AFFECTED.\n>> DANA, YOUR THOUGHTS, THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR SAYS\nSOMETHING THAT PEOPLE MAY NOT HAVE REALIZED, TRUMP ALSO LEFT A\nSIZABLE DONATION. >> IF HE LEFT A SIZABLE\nDONATION, AGAIN, IF THAT WAS BECAUSE HE WAS DOING IT OUT OF\nHIS HEART AND WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT, THAT WOULD BE A GOOD\nTHING WHICH MEANS HE WASN'T DOING IT FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES\nAND I WON'T DO IT EITHER. I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A\nSTATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ON SCORING POLITICAL POINTS ABOUT\nHURRICANE KATRINA. I KNOW THE WHITE HOUSE WAS ASKED\nABOUT IT TODAY, SWIPES AT BUSH. IT WAS A TRAGEDY, CATASTROPHIC.\nFAR BE IT FOR ME TO POINT OUT THAT THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR AND\nDEMOCRATIC MAYOR WERE INCOMPETENT FROM THE BEGINNING.\nPRESIDENT BUSH SAID HE SHOULDN'T HAVE FLOWN OVER.\nOVERALL FEMA PERFORMED BETTER NOW THAN THEY DID TEN YEARS AGO,\nNOW 11 YEARS SINCE HURRICANE KATRINA.\nTHAT SHOULD BE THE THING ABOUT GOVERNMENT.\nI'M NOT WORRYING ABOUT SCORING POLITICAL POINTS ON THIS ONE.\n>> GREG, SHOULD WE NOT BE LEADING THIS SEGMENT WITH\nPRESIDENT OBAMA STILL ON THE GOLF COURSE?\n>> I DON'T THINK SO BECAUSE I OFTEN ASK MYSELF WOULD WE DO\nTHIS STORY IF IT DIDN'T HAVE A POLITICAL BENT.\nOF COURSE, I WONDER HOW MANY PEOPLE STILL THINK ABOUT THAT\nCHILD IN SYRIA THAT WE TALKED ABOUT LAST WEEK.\nA LARGE PORTION PROBABLY DIDN'T --\n>> WE SHOWED THE PICTURE AN HOUR AGO.\nSAD. >> IT IS SAD BUT MY POINT IS\nTHIS. UNLESS THE STORY BEARS POLITICAL\nFRUIT, SOMETIMES PEOPLE IN THE MEDIA DON'T COVER IT.\nTHERE ARE SOME INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT THIS STORY.\nA MAJOR HURRICANE HASN'T HIT THE U.S. GULF OR THE EAST COAST IN\nLIKE A DECADE ACCORDING TO THE \"WASHINGTON POST.\"\nWHEN THEY DO HIT, THEY TEND TO BE WORSE BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE\nPEOPLE CONCENTRATED IN AREAS. IRONICALLY, THE GOOD POINT THAT\nTHEY HAVEN'T HAPPENED MAKES PEOPLE LESS READY WHEN THEY DO.\n>> THAT'S RIGHT. >> IF YOU TALK ABOUT THE FACTS,\nIT'S ACTUALLY MORE INTERESTING AND MORE HELPFUL MAYBE.\n>> YES, BUT LET ME PLAY A LITTLE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE ON THAT POINT\nTHERE. THE GOVERNOR AND LIEUTENANT\nGOVERNOR WERE BOTH HAPPY TRUMP CAME.\n>> THE RIGHT THING TO DO. THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS TO GO\nTHERE AND TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.\nI THINK ANYBODY WHO WOULD GO AND SEE THE DEVASTATION AND THE\nFAMILIES DISPLACED AND EVERYONE'S LIVES AFFECTED AND\nWHAT THE CHURCHES ARE DOING TO HELP PEOPLE, YOU WOULD PROBABLY\nBE MOVED IF YOU HAD MONEY TO MAKE A DONATION.\nTHERE IS JUST REALLY NO SUBSTITUTE FOR GOING THERE IN\nPERSON AND SEEING AND FEELING AND BREATHING AND SMELLING THE\nDEVASTATION OF THE FLOODING. IT'S HORRIBLE AND THE PEOPLE\nTHAT ARE JUST -- THEIR WHOLE LIVES ARE ERASED LIKE SOMEONE\nHIT THE DELETE BUTTON. IT'S VERY, VERY DIFFICULT.\nTHE PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE GONE THERE.\nTHE WHOLE WORLD KNOWS IT AND EVEN LIBERAL CARTOONS ARE\nPUTTING STUFF OUT THERE OF HIM PLAYING GOLF.\n>> MADAM SECRETARY WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT AND HAS A LOT OF MONEY\nAT YOUR DISPOSAL, THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, NEW ORLEANS, THE\nPEOPLE OF LOUISIANA, BATON ROUGE, MAYBE THEY OPEN UP THE\nCOFFERS OF THE CLINTON FOUNDATION FOR PEOPLE DOWN\nSOUTH. >> TO DANA'S POINT AND TO THE\nEXTENT I BELIEVE THAT GEORGE W. BUSH SHOULD HAVE COME TO\nLOUISIANA, THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA\nTO LEARN FROM THAT. THAT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY TO SAY --\n>> THE ONLY THING ABOUT PRESIDENT BUSH GOING IS SHOULD\nHE HAVE GONE ON THAT DAY. WE COULD GET POLITICAL AND TALK\nABOUT THE FACT THAT THE NAACP FOR EXAMPLE HAS JUST STRIPPED\nOUT SUPPORT OF ALL CHARTER SCHOOLS.\nTHAT'S PART OF ITS PLATFORM NOW. REBUILDING NEW ORLEANS WAS NOT\nJUST ABOUT THE LEVIES BUT THE ENTIRE CITY.\nTHE CATHOLIC SCHOOL REHABILITATION AND THE CHARTER\nSCHOOL THING. >> THERE'S A PART OF ALL THAT.\nI'M NOT SAYING IT NEEDS TO BE POLITICAL BUT I'M SAYING -- I\nTHINK YOU JUST SAID, LOOKING BACK ON IT THE FLYOVER WAS NOT\nGOOD. >> ON THAT PARTICULAR DAY, NO.\n>> ON THAT PARTICULAR DAY. I'M SAYING PRESIDENT OBAMA\nSHOULD LOOK AT THAT PART OF HISTORY AND LEARN SOMETHING FROM\nTHAT JUST LIKE THAT WASN'T THE BEST CHOICE.\n>> HE DID WHEN HE WAS RUNNING FOR OFFICE THE FIRST AND THE\nSECOND TIME. >> IN A WAY THAT MATTERS TO\nPEOPLE, IT SEEMED LIKE A MISSED OPPORTUNITY.\n>> THEY'RE WRAPPING US.

THIS IS THE STORY NOW, VERY\nSORRY OBVIOUSLY, YOUNG GUYS LIKE THAT, HE HAS BEEN TRAINING A\nLONG TIME TO DO THE OLYMPICS, THERE IS A LOT OF PERSONAL\nSACRIFICE, I GET THE WHOLE BLOWOFF TEAM, THIS IS WHY YOU\nHAVE TO TRAVEL WITH SECURITY.

WE ALREADY KNEW ABOUT THE $145\nMILLION THAT WENT INTO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nTHAT WAS JUST AFTER THE SECRETARY OF STATE, HILLARY\nCLINTON, OKAYED A DEAL TO SELL 20 TO 25% OF U.S. URANIUM\nPRODUCTION TO THE RUSSIANS. THINK ABOUT THIS.\nTHESE ARE TEXTBOOK BUSINESS SCHOOL QUID PRO QUOS.\n>> PAY FOR PLAY. >> EVEN WORSE.\nUNTIL JAMES ROSEN TODAY ASKED THE QUESTION AT THE STATE\nDEPARTMENT. DID YOU HEAR THAT QUESTION?\n>> THERE'S AN E-MAIL IN ONE OF THOSE 15,000 E-MAILS, GOING FROM\nTHE CLINTON FOUNDATION OPERATIVE TO CHERYL MILLS.\nTHE E-MAIL SAYS, HEY, CAN YOU ASK OUR BOSS IF SHE CAN DO THIS,\nMEANING CLINTON FOUNDATION, HILLARY CLINTON, BOSS, STATE\nDEPARTMENT. SHE CAN'T HAVE BOTH OF THOSE\nTITLES. SHE CAN'T.\nAND THAT EXPOSES THEM. >> BUT SHE DID.\n>> HER CAMPAIGN MANAGER, ROBBIE MOOK, TRIED TO ANSWER SOME OF Y\n>> WE HAVE REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS AND RIGHT WING GROUPS\nDOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO TRY TO MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF NOTHING\nHERE. THE FACT IS THAT AT EVERY\nJUNCTURE THE FOUNDATION HAS GONE ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT IS USUALLY\nIN PLACE IN TERMS OF ETHICS AND RULES FOR A FOUNDATION LIKE\nTHIS. WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH, THE SECOND\nPRESIDENT BUSH CAME INTO OFFICE, YOU NEVER HEARD PEOPLE ASKING\nQUESTIONS ABOUT HIS FAMILY'S FOUNDATION, WHICH WAS A VERY\nSIMILAR SITUATION AND MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY REMAINED ON THE BOARD\nOF THEIR FOUNDATION WHILE HE WAS PRESIDENT.\nSO WHAT WE'RE JUST ASKING FOR IS FOR PEOPLE TO TAKE A FAIR LOOK\nAT THE SITUATION. >> TAKING A FAIR LOOK, GREG,\nLAURA BUSH, THE FORMER FIRST LADY, WAS NOT THEN SERVING AS\nTHE SECRETARY OF STATE. >> HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?\nI DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY RECORDS OF THAT.\n>> THERE ARE NO RECORDS OF THAT? >> THEY WERE ACTUALLY THROWN\nOUT. LOOK, MY QUESTION IS WHERE DOES\nTHIS GO FROM HERE? I DON'T THINK THE MEDIA IS DOING\nQUITE THE JOB THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO IN THIS ARENA OF LOOKING AT\nTHE CLINTON FOUNDATION OR THE CLINTON GLOBAL INITIATIVE WHICH\nIS EGI WHICH IS INTERESTING BECAUSE IT'S SPECIAL EFFECTS TO\nALTER REALITY. THE ONLY WAY THIS IS GOING TO\nCOME APART IS AT THE DEBATE BECAUSE TRUMP WILL HAVE TO FORCE\nHER TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THAT THE MEDIA DOESN'T BECAUSE SO FAR\nIN THIS GAME OF WHACK AMOLE, THE MOLE HASN'T SHOWN UP.\nYOU CAN'T HIT THE MOLE BECAUSE IT'S NEVER THERE, BUT ON THE\nDEBATE, THE MOLE IS GOING TO HAVE TO COME UP.\n>> THE MOLE IS TRACKED ON THE STAGE.\n>> FORMER MAYOR OF NEW YORK, RUDY GIULIANI AND A REPORTER OF\nTRUMP'S KIMBERLY BASICALLY SAID THE CLINTON GLOBAL INITIATIVE,\nHE USED THE WORD BRIBERY. WILL THAT FACTOR INTO FBI\nCONSIDERATION OR WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE?\n>> AS A FORMER MAYOR BUT AS A FORMER PROSECUTOR WHO'S\nINVESTIGATED AND PROSECUTED RACKETEERING AND RICO VIOLATIONS\nAND HE'S SAYING WHAT WE SAW HERE, THIS LEVEL OF CORRUPTION\nIS SO OVERT THAT IT RISES TO THE SAME LEVEL AND WOULD WARRANT A\nVERY THOROUGH AND FAIR INVESTIGATION AND POTENTIALLY\nINDICTMENT. >> UNDER RICO?\n>> THAT'S WHAT I JUST SAID. THAT'S WHAT HE'S SAYING.\nHE THINKS THERE IS DEFINITELY A CASE TO BE MADE FOR IT BUT YOU\nDON'T SEE THEM CLIMBING OVER THEMSELVES TO PROPERLY\nINVESTIGATE IT. IF IT WERE ANYBODY ELSE BUT THE\nCLINTONS, THEY WOULD BE -- >> THERE IS FURTHER INFORMATION,\nEBONY, THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAVING SEEN ALL THIS\nINFORMATION HEARD FROM THE FBI REPEATEDLY HAS SAID THERE'S\nNOTHING TO SEE HERE AT THE GLOBAL INITIATIVE.\nEVERYTHING IS FINE AND LET IT GO.\n>> TO BREAK IT DOWN, DANA, THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, THEY'VE DONE\nGREAT WORK AND THAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE BUT YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS\nLEGAL DOCTRINE, FRUIT OF THE POISONOUS TREE.\nTHAT'S REALLY BIG HERE. >> WHAT IS THE FRUIT OF THE\nPOISONOUS TREE? >> DON'T EAT IT.\nWHEN IT GOES THROUGH CORRUPTION EVEN IF IT'S DOING GOOD WORK OR\nGOOD WILL OR IT'S VALUABLE, IT'S CORRUPT, TAINTED AND THEREFORE\nIT CAN'T BE USED THE SAME WAY. >> EVEN IF YOU BUILT A BUNCH OF\nCLINTON WATER WELLS IN AFRICA IT DOESN'T MATTER?\n>> THAT'S RIGHT. ALL THAT GOOD STUFF THAT THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION HAS DONE, THE METHOD IN WHICH YOU'VE GOTTEN\nTHOSE RESOURCES IS SO FOUL AND CORRUPT AND HORRIBLE THAT WE\nHAVE TO TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION.\nTHAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. >> IT'S LIKE THE DRUG KING PIN\nOPENING UP A PLAYGROUND FOR THE KIDS OVER THERE.\nIT'S A SIMILAR EXAMPLE. BUT ALSO, CHARITY NAVIGATOR,\nTHAT'S A WEBSITE THAT ISSUES -- IT SCORES DIFFERENT CHARITIES.\nIN 2015 THEY BACKED OUT AND THEY SAID WE CAN'T EVEN ATTEMPT TO\nRATE THE CLINTON FOUNDATION ANYMORE BECAUSE THERE'S NO\nTRANSPARENCY. >> I THINK WE DID THAT STORY.\nWE NEVER KNEW IT WOULD GET TO BE THIS BIG.\n>> I HAVE A HUNCH IF YOU CONTINUE WITH THESE E-MAILS\nYOU'LL FIND MORE OF A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY.\n>> WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON. BEFORE WE GO, THE JUDICIAL WATCH\nWHO'S FILING ALL THESE LAWSUITS, BRINGING ALL THIS INFORMATION,\nTHE JUDGE SAID THAT THE CLINTONS HAVE UNTIL OCTOBER 14th TO --\nTHEY MUST SUBMIT TO QUESTIONS BY OCTOBER 14th.\nAND THE JUDGE SAYS SHE HAS, GUESS WHAT, 30 DAYS IN WHICH TO\nANSWER WHICH WOULD PUT IT BEYOND THE GENERAL ELECTION.\n>> UNBELIEVABLE.",

HEARD THAT VOLKSWAGEN PLANS TO\nHAVE PRODUCTION CONCERNS. AUTO MAKER REACHING AN AGREEMENT\nIN THE DISPUTE. FOR NOW GETTING THE REPORT FROM\nA GERMAN NEWSPAPER. WE WILL BRING YOU ANY\nCONFIRMATION UPDATES AS THEY COME.\n>> ANY IDEA HOW MUCH THAT IS GOING TO COST THEM.\n>> BEEN VARIOUS ESTIMATES. AGAIN THAT SUMMER TENDS TO BE A\nQUIET PERIOD FOR PRODUCTION OF ITSELF.\nALSO INTERESTING CITY WITH A NOTE OUT THIS MORNING SAYING\nTHEY COULD SURVIVE THIS WITHOUT A MEANINGFUL IMPACT.\nTHEY HAVE KEPT THEIR BUY RATING. >> MEANWHILE A RECENT SLIDE IN\nDIVIDEND YIELDING STOCKS COULD BE A WARNING OF BROADER DOWNTURN\nTO COME. THAT IS ACCORDING TO BARONS.\nAS A SIGN THAT WILL MARKETS MAY HAVE PIQUED.\nJOINING US NOW IS ERIC. VERY INTERESTING REPORT COMING\nOUT OF BARON REALLY SHOWING WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE PREDICTING,\nPERHAPS UTILITY, CONSUMER STAPLES, SOME OF THE BRIGHT\nSPOTS FOR THE FIRST PART OF THE YEAR.\nFINALLY THIS HAS PIQUED. IS THAT YOUR VIEW?\n>> YES, ABSOLUTELY. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT\nTHE EARNINGS GROWTH OF THOSE BUSINESSES AND IT'S JUST NOT\nTHERE TO SUPPORT THE DIVIDENDS,  UNQUENCHABLE THIRST FOR YIELD IS\nPROBABLY A MISGUIDED APPROACH. WHAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON\nARE THE DIVIDEND GROWTH COMPANIES AND MORE IMPORTANTLY\nTHE COMPANIES THAT CAN GROW DIVIDENDS IN FUTURE.\nNOT NECESSARILY THE COMPANY WHO IS HAVE THE HIGHEST YIELD.\nI THINK THAT'S A FAIRLY TROUBLESOME AREA, ESPECIALLY\nCOMING OFF A 2014 WHERE THOSE WERE THE STRONGEST SECTORS ONLY\nTO BE THE WORST PERFORMING SECTOR IN 2015 AND NOW AGAIN\nHERE WE ARE IN 2016. SEEING THE SAME THING REPEAT.\n>> SOME OF THOSE NAMES BECAUSE OF ALL OF A SUDDEN WE'RE SEEING\nA REVERSE FOR UTILITIES, FOR CONSUMER STAP LTS.\nWHERE SHOULD INVESTORS BE MOVING THEN?\n>> IT'S JUST IF YOU LOOK THROUGH THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE IN THE\nS&P 500, FOR EXAMPLE, OR ANY OF THE MAJOR EMBASSIES.\nWHAT YOU HAVE TO LOOK FOR ARE THE HEALTHIEST BUSINESSES.\nHIGH QUALITY COMPANIES. WE DEFINE THAT AS COMPANIES THAT\nGROW DIVIDENDS OVER TIME. NOT NECESSARILY THE HIGHEST\nYIELD. A STRONG YIELD, BUT CAN GROW THE\nDIVIDEND OVER TIME. THE MANAGEMENT TEAM PHILOSOPHY\nON WHERE THEY SEE THE BUSINESS GOING.\nSO IF YOU THINK ABOUT THINGS LIKE NIKE, STARBUCKS, SOME OF\nTHE BUSINESSES THAT MAYBE ARE ESTABLISHED BUSINESSES, BUT\nTHEY'VE RECENTLY STARTED TO PAY A DIVIDEND OR IN THE CASE OF\nNIKE THAT HAVE PAID A DIVIDEND FOR YEARS, BUT HAVE ALWAYS\nMAINTAINED A STABILITY OF THAT DIVIDEND, AND, OF COURSE,\nFOLLOWED THE EARNINGS GROWTH RIGHT ALONG WITH IT.\n>> ERIC, IF WE LOOK AT THE CURRENT PAYOUT RATIOS WE'RE\nSEEING RELATIVE TO HISTORIC COLLABORATIVES FOR THE LARGE\nCAPS IN PARTICULAR, WHERE ARE WE AT THERE?\nI WONDER IF WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT SECTORS LIKE TECH.\nTHEY HAVE A LOT OF CASH ON THE BALANCE SHEET.\nLOOKS LIKE THE PAYOUT RATIO IS VERY LOW COMPARED TO THE\nAVERAGE. >> YES, THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO\nREALLY ASSOCIATE WITH IS THE COMPANIES THAT CAN GROW THEIR\nDIVIDENDS RIGHT, SO TECH WOULD BE A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THAT.\nTECH HAS A ONE OF THE LOWEST PAYOUT RATIOS OF THE ENTIRE S&P\nSECTOR. IF YOU THINK ABOUT TECH OF THE\n'90s HAD AN ENTIRE SECTOR JUST COMING OF AGE.\nTRYING TO FIGURE ITSELF OUT. NOT REALLY IN THE STAGE WHERE\nTHEY COULD PAY A DIVIDEND. NOW WE HAVE COMPANIES LIKE\nMICROSOFT, INTEL, SOME OF THESE MAJOR BUSINESSES THAT HAVE A\nSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CASH ON THE BALANCE SHEET.\nAPPLE IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT.\nTHEY CAN CONTINUE TO PAY THE CASH BACK TO THE SHAREHOLDERS,\nBUT ALSO TO INCREASE IT OVER TIME.\nONE OF THE THINGS, SPEAKING OF PAYOUT RATIOS.\nWE FOUND EARNINGS CAN BE SO VOLATILE THAT YOU CAN'T REALLY\nDEFINE IT AS AN EARNINGS OR DIVIDEND PAYOUT RATIO.\nYOU SHOULD LOOK AT THE FREE CASH FLOW TO DIVIDEND RATIO.\nTHAT'S A MUCH MORE MEANINGFUL FIGURE OF REALLY HEALTH FACTOR\nAND WHETHER OR NOT THE BUSINESS CAN SUSTAIN THE DIVIDEND GROWTH.\n>> THAT'S A GREAT POINT. IF WE LOOK AT WHAT WE SAW FROM\nTHE DIVIDENDS THOUGH IN THE SECOND QUARTER, I THINK MAYBE\nTHE SLOWEST GROWTH WE'VE SEEN SINCE 2013.\nI GUESS AS YOU POINT OUT, THAT'S AN ACTUAL FOLLOW THROUGH FROM\nWHAT WE'RE SEEING IN TERMS OF PROFIT EXPANSION AND A STRONGER\nDOLLAR. I WONDER WHETHER THIS IS\nBRINGING LIGHT INTO MORE SUSTAINABLE LEVELS AT THIS\nSTAGE. >> YES.\nIF YOU LOOK BACK A SIGNIFICANT PERIOD OF TIME, GOING BACK TO\n1973, WE'VE ONLY SEEN THREE NEGATIVE YEARS OF DIVIDEND\nGROWTH IN THE S&P 500. ON AVERAGE IT'S BEEN AROUND\n6.5%. FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS, AS YOU\nPOINT OUT, THE DIVIDEND GROWTH HAS BEEN VERY STRONG AS WE CAME\nOUT OF THE DEPTH OF THE RECESSION.\nDOUBLE DIGITS FOR THOSE FIVE YEARS.\nNOW WE'LL BE ON A MORE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD WE'LL SEE DIVIDEND\nGROWTH IN THE 5 TO 6% RANGE.  EARNINGS.\nIF YOU EXPECT TO SEE SOME KIND OF ECONOMIC EXPANSION, YOU\nSHOULD EXPECT TO SEE SOME KIND OF EARNINGS EXPANSION.\nRIGHT NOW DIVIDENDS ARE UP AROUND 3% FOR THE YEAR.\n5.5% YEAR OVER YEAR. AGAIN, WE THINK THEY'LL PROBABLY\nEND THE YEAR AROUND 6, 6.5% THIS YEAR.\n>> ERIC, GREAT TO CHAT WITH YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR\nWISDOM. I SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED BY\nTHAT, BUT THAT IS AN INTERESTING FACT.\nS&P 500 DIVIDENDS HAVE ONLY BEEN NEGATIVE THREE TIMES IN THE PAST\n45 YEARS. >> MEANWHILE, TAKING ANOTHER\nLOOK AT FUND FLOWS. NEARLY $1 TRILLION HAVE FLOWED\nINTO INDEX TRACKING FUND AND ETF SINCE 2009.\nTHIS COMES AS APPROXIMATELY $6 BILLION HAS ACTIVELILY HEDGED\nFUNDS IN THE PERIOD. >> INVESTORS TRYING TO BEAT THE\nSTOCK MARKET. LONG RUNNING RUSH OF MONEY INTO\nINDEX FUND HAS ACCELERATED THIS YEAR.\nSIMPLY SEEK TO MATCH THE OVERALL MARKET PERFORMANCE.\nMORE THAN $900 BILLION WAS FLOED INTO INDEX FUNDS SINCE 2009.\nWITH $160 BILLION ENTERING IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2016 ALONE.\nON THE LOSING END, ACTIVELILY MANAGING STOCK FUNDS.\nMANAGER TRIES TO PICK FUNDS TO OUT PERFORMANCE AN INDEX.\nNOW, THE VIRTUES OF INDEX FUND ARE WELL-KNOWN.\nDELIVER PROD MARKET EXPOSURE. THEIR APPEAL HAS GROAN IN PART\nAS INVESTORS FOCUS MORE ON HOW HARD IT IS TO FIND ACTIVE\nMANAGERS TO OUTPACE THE MARKET ALL THE TIME.\nOSKT, INDEXING BECOMES FASHIONABLE AFTER A BULL MARKET\nHAS BEEN ROLLING ALONG FOR A WHILE.\nAS THE CURRENT ONE HAS. OFTEN PIQUED JUST ADD STOCK\nPICKERS AMOUNT A COMEBACK. SOME MARKET ANALYSTS SUGGEST WE\nMIGHT BE NEARING SUCH A POINT RIGHT NOW.\nKNOW THE MONEY IS GOING TO FUNDS THAT DON'T RESEARCH COMPANIES.\nSO DOES THIS MEAN MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR ACTIVE MANAGER\nTO FIND THOSE ATTRACTIVE STOCKS. PERHAPS.\nIN THE PAST FEW MONTHS THE AVERAGE STOCK IN THE S&P 500 HAS\nBEEN OUTPERFORMING THE INDEX. THAT'S A HINT THE STOCK PICKERS\nARE HAVING IT A BIT EASY. ACTIVE FUND MANAGERS START WITH\nA HANDICAP OF HIGHER FEES. STOCK PICKERS WILL HAVE TO GO ON\nA CONVINCING WINNING STREAK AGAINST THE MARKET IF THEY HOPE\nTO TURN THE TIED AGAINST THOSE EFFICIENT MECHANICAL INDEX\nFUNDS.

WE HAVE YOUR TRADERS ON THE\nDESK. TONIGHT ON FAST, OIL GETTING ITS\nWORST DAY SINCE AUGUST FIRST. THE PERFECT STORM MAY BE\nBREWING. AND PLUS A DEVELOPING STORY\nWE'RE FOLLOWING THIS IT HOUR. SENATOR CHUCK GRASSLEY ON MYLAN\nEPI PEN COST INCREASE SENDING THAT STOCK SLIDING.\nWE'RE AL OVER THE STORY. AND LATER ON, TOM LEE SAYS HE'S\nBUYING STOCK WITH HIGH YIELD.L . AND LATER ON, TOM LEE SAYS HE'S\nBUYING STOCK WITH HIGH YIELD. TONIGHT HE WILL GIVE US THREE\nNAMES HE'S BETTING BIG ON. BUT FIRST, SOMETHING SURPRISING\nIN THE MARKET SINCE WE WERE LAST ON THE AIR.\nSINCE THE START OF THE OLYMPICS ON AUGUST 5, WE'VE SEEN SOME\nVERY BIG MOVES IN SEVERAL RETAILERS.\nSO BIG IN FACT WE'RE CALLING IT A RETAIL RENAISSANCE.\nTAKE A LOOK. NORDSTROM, MACY'S, FOOT LOCKER,\nRALPH LAUREN AND KOHL'S SEEING GAINS WITH MORE THAN 2%.\nIS IT TIME TO TAKE PROFITS? PETE, WHAT DO YOU SAY?\nSTICK WITH THE MOVE? >> THE MAJORITY OF THE NAMES\nWERE BEATEN DOWN AND WE TALK ABOUT THE ROTATION IN THE\nMARKETPLACE AND YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON IN RETAIL AND I\nTHINK WHAT WE SAW THROUGH THE EARNINGS SEASON HAS BEEN THESE\nNAMES DIDN'T DO AS POORLY AND SO THEY WERE ABLE TO STEP OVER THE\nBAR. AND YOU STILL LOOKED AT NAMES,\nWE TALK ABOUT VALUATION. VALUATIONS STILL REMAIN LOW.\nIN SOME CASES YOU'RE GETTING A GREAT YIELD.\nNORDSTROM HAS RACK WHICH CONTINUES TO PERFORM FOR THEM.\nMACY'S HAS THEIR OFF BRAND. SO EVERYBODY HAS SOMETHING.\nIT'S JUST A MATTER OF HOW WELL ARE YOU EXECUTING.\nBECAUSE WE ALL KNOW HOW FICKLE CONSUMERS CAN BE.\nBUT I THINK THIS QUARTER WHAT SURPRISED THE STREET WAS THEY\nDIDN'T DO AS BADLY AS EXPECTED. >> AND THIS HASN'T HAPPENED IN A\nVACUUM. WE DID GET A NUMBER OF RETAIL EARNINGS SOME BETTER THAN\nEXPECTED. AND THERE IS A SEASONALITY\nFACTOR, PERHAPS. >> SO LAST YEAR YOU HAD THE\nWEATHER ISSUE WHERE YOU HAD ABNORMALLY WARMER SEASONAL\nWEATHER. SO YOU HAD THE DISCOUNTERS, T.J.\nMAXX, ROSS STORES. SO A LOT OF THESE NAMES HAD THE\nBEST THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE? I DON'T THINK YOU WILL SEE IT\nAGAIN. BECAUSE WHAT THEY DID LAST YEAR\nWAS THEY HAD TOO MUCH INVENTORY, SO THEY SOLD IT TO THE DISCOUNTERS.\nNAMES THAT DID DO WELL ARE SELLS, THE ONES THAT DIDN'T,\nBUY. >> ROTATION IS A REALLY ABOUT\nPART OF IT. TRADING NEAR 52 WEEK HIGHS,\nWALMART, HOME DEPOT, YOU KNOW, THOSE STOCKS HAVE YET TO BREAK\nOUT. COSTCO IS ANOTHER ONE.\nAND THEY HAVE BEEN PUTTING UP GOOD MONTHLY SALES NUMBERS.\nTHE OTHER ONES PUT UP DECENT RESULTS.\nBUT THEN YOU HAVE BIG NAMES LIKE TARGET AND LOWES THAT SOLD OFF A\nLOT THE. AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THAT\nLIST, THE MARKET CAP, IT PALES IN COMPARISON TO SOME OF THE\nMOVES THAT WE SAW IN SOME OF THE LARGER CAP NAMES.\nSO I THINK YOU SAW A ROTATION INTO THINGS THAT HAD VERY LOW\nEXPECTATIONS THAT WERE BEATEN UP A LOT AND I THINK REALLY THE\nNEXT PLAY FOR RETAIL IS PLAYING THE HOME DEPOT, COSTCO AND\nWALMART FOR BREAKOUT. IF THAT'S THE TREND, IF THAT'S\nWHERE YOU WANT TO BE, THEN YOU HAVE TO GO THERE.\n>> WELCOME BACK. >> GREAT TO BE BACK.\n>> THE BOTTOM LINE HERE IN THE RETAIL SECTOR IS THE BAR WAS\nEXTREMELY LOW. AND IF YOU LOOK AT MACY'S, 17%\nSHORT SQUEEZE. RALPH LAUREN I'M LONG, BUT\nAGAIN, A NAME THAT IS IN TRANSITION.\nI THINK THE LONG TERM PROSPECTS FOR THIS COMPANY ARE GOOD.\nBUT FOR THOSE NAMES THAT ARE HEAVILY SHORTED, IT'S AN\nEXISTENTIAL MOMENT. IN RALPH LAUREN'S CASE, THEY ARE\nTRYING TO GET UBIQUITOUS.\nYOU HAVE A MANAGEMENT TEAM THINKING FORWARD.\nXRT AT 46, THAT IS THE TOP END OF A RANGE THAT I WOULD NOT BE\nCHASING. IF ANYTHING, IT'S RUN INTO THE\nRESISTANCE OF 46 MULTIPLE. >> YOU MENTIONED THE ONES TRYING\nTO GET MORE EXCLUSIVITY. CORS AND COACH HAD THAT PROBLEM\nFOR SOME TIME AND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SCALING BACK IN\nTHE DEPARTMENT STORE CHANNELS. INTERESTING TO SEE THE\nDEPARTMENT STORES DO WELL DURING THIS PERIOD WHEN THEY ARE\nPOO-POOING THEIR BUSINESS BASICALLY.\n>> I PLOOE COMPLETELY AGREE. I THINK SOMEONE THAT STOOD OUT\nTO ME IS STAR GET.  REALLY AREN'T A COMPARISON.\nWALMART 56% OF IT IS COMING THROUGH GROCERY.\nTARGET DOESN'T HAVE THAT SAME BLEND.\nIT'S ONLY 20% OF THEIR REVENUE THROUGH GROCERY.\nTHAT REALLY I THINK IS SOMETHING THAT IS CAUSING TARGET TO HAVE\nSOME ISSUES. AND BECAUSE OF THAT WE'RE\nLOOKING AT A NAME THAT TRADES AT A 13 MULTIPLE.\nTHEY HAVE GREAT EARNINGS. BUYING BACK STOCK.\nDOING EVERYTHING RIGHT. EVERYTHING THAT THEY SHOULD BE\nDOING. AND YET THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO\nPERFORM WITH WALMART BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT THE ONE STOP SHOP\nTHAT WALMART NOW HAS CREATED WITH GROCERY.\n>> SO IF THEY TWEAK GROCERY, THEIR PROBLEM IS SOLVED?\n>> I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S SOLVED, BUT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM THEY\nFACE IS THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MIX OF GROCERY AND THEY HAVE TO\nGET IT RIGHT. >> IT'S AN ELECTRONICS PROBLEM,\nAS WELL. THERE IS NOBODY KNEW TO BUY OUT\nTHERE. >> I THINK WHAT IS GOING\nORGANIZATION FIRST OF ALL THERE, IS DEFLATION IN FOOD SO IT'S\nACTUALLY A BAD THING. WHAT WALMART IS DOING IS THEY\nARE GETTING BACK TO WHAT THEY ARE ALWAYS DOMINATING ON, PRICE\nCOMPETITIVENESS. THEY HAVE REINVESTED IN THEIR\nBASICS. MEANWHILE THEY WILL SUFFER.\nI THINK ON MARGIN A LOT OF THESE GUYS ARE LOOKING AT A VERY\nDIFFICULT SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR BECAUSE IN FACT YOU HAVE\nDEFLATIONARY FORCES. FOR RETAILERS, YOU WANT TO SEE\nINFLATION. I WANT TO --\n>> THERE IS BACK TO SCHOOL AND HOLIDAY SHOPPING.\n>> BUT THERE ARE TOO MANY -- THERE IS TOO MUCH COMPETITION\nCHASING TWO FEW SALES DOLLARS. >> AND TO GET MORE CAUGHT IN THE\nWEEDS, ULTA IS UP 46%. THE ONE THING THEY WERE HITTING\nON WAS COSMETICS. THAT IS STILL A BUY UP 46%.\n>> MACY'S BLUE MERCURY, YOU LIKE THAT PLACE, RIGHT?\nTHAT SHOULD BE AN INTERESTING ASSET.\nI JUST WANT TO MENTION TARGET. YOU TALKED ABOUT NOT HAVING\nSTUFF TO BUY. THEY SPECIFICALLY CALLED OUT\nAPPLE PRODUCTS. THAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING.\nAND THEN WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT CAN THIS MOVE CARRY THROUGH\nAFTER BACK TO SCHOOL, WE KNOW APPLE WILL BE RELEASING NEW\nPHONES AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, THERE IS A COMPANY EXPECTED\nDO PROBABLY 30 BILLION IN CELLPHONE SALES DURING THE\nSEPTEMBER/OCTOBER PERIOD, YOU KNOW.\nTHAT COULD PULL FROM A LOT OF DEMAND.\n>> DO YOU LIKE TARGET? BECAUSE I BOUGHT IT.\n>> I TOOK A SHOT A COUPLE MONTHS AGO 70 BUCKS, AND IT RALLIED\nBACK 75, 76. AND I'LL MAKE ONE OTHER POINT.\nWHAT HAPPENED WHILE WE WERE GONE?\nALSO WALMART PAID $3.3 BILLION FOR JET.COM.\nYOU SAID WALMART IS KILLING EVERYBODY.\nBUT WALMART HAS BEEN GETTING KILLED BY AMAZON.\nTHEY NEED TO IMPROVE IN ONLINE SALES.\n>> ONLINE BUSINESS HAS GROWN UPON ITSELF FOR THE FIRST TIME\nEVER. REALITY IS WALMART IS GETTING\nBACK TO -- THEY LOST PRICE COMPETITIVENESS.\nTHAT'S WHAT WALMART IS ALL ABOUT.\nIT'S A MASSIVE PLACE WHERE PEOPLE DO IT ALL.\n>> LET'S SHIFT TO ENERGY NOW. PERFECT STORM MAY BE BREWING IN\nTHE OIL MARKET. DENNIS GARTMAN WARNING INVESTORS\nNOT TO BANK ON ANY NEAR TERM RALLIES.\nAND HE'S JOINING US. HE IS IN VIRGINIA BEACH.\nGOOD TO SEE YOU. WHAT IS THIS PERFECT STORM\nBREWING? >> WELL, THERE ARE A LOT OF\nTHINGS THAT HAVE GONE ON. FIRST OF ALL, LET'S REMEMBER\nSEVERAL WEEKS AGO AT THE BOTTOM YOU HAD AN OUTSIDE REVERSAL DAY\nIN CRUDE OIL AND I SAID I THINK YOU'LL GET A STRONG RALLY TO\nTAKE PLACE $7, $8. IT ACTUALLY WENT $8, OR $9 OR\n$10. BUT YOU HAD THE MARKET RALLYING\nON NEWS OUTOF NIGERIA AND ANGOLA THAT PRODUCTION WOULD BE\nCURTAILED. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE BETTING THAT\nIT WOULD DECLINE MATERIALLY BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS IN THE\nSOUTHEAST REGION WITH THE AVENGERS WHO LAST NIGHT SIGNED A\nPEACE TREATY. WE'LL SEE IF IT HOLDS.\nBUT WHEN THAT NEWS HIT THE DAY, CRUDE OIL FELL PRECIPITOUSLY.\nTHAT NEWS CAME OUT ABOUT 3:00 THIS MORNING AND IT CHAGED THE\nMARKET DRAMATICALLY YOU HAVE PRODUCTION INCREASES FROM IRAQ.\nYOU HAVE PRODUCTION MAINTAINED HIGH AND LIKELY TO RISE IN IRAN.\nAND YOU HAVE THE SAUDIS OBVIOUSLY ANTAGONISTIC TOWARD\nTHE IRANIANS. SO HERE AT $50, WTI, $52 BRENT,\nWITH A $4 TO $5 CONTANGO FOR THE ONE YEAR, SUDDENLY FRACKING IS\nONE AGAINST PROFITABLE AND A LOT OF DRILLED BUT UNCOMPLETED\nWELLS, DUCKS AS THEY'RE CALLED, ARE COMING ON LINE.\nSO THAT WHICH HAD BEEN BULLISH SUDDENLY TURNED SOMEWHAT\nBEARISH. I THINK YOU COULD TRADE CRUDE\nOIL DOWN FOUR, FIVE EASILY.\n>> AND YOU THINK THE GAINS COULD BE CAPPED.\nSO WE'LL TRY TO HAVE A PING-PONG SORT OF TRADE HERE.\n>> WELL, THAT IS MY FEAR. I WISH THAT WE HAD SEEN CRUDE\nOIL GO SIDEWAYS AT THE BOTTOM, QUIETLY RALLY, AND THEN YOU\nCOULD HAVE HAD SOMETHING THAT WAS SUSTAINABLE.\nBUT THE FACT THAT YOU RALLIED $10 BRINGS A LOT OF NEW\nPRODUCTION OR A LOT OF OLD PRODUCTION THAT HAD BEEN CLOSED\nONLINE FAR TOO QUIGLEY. I'M AFRAID WE MIGHT SEE THIS\nSORT OF ACTIVITY WHERE WE TRADED TO 50 TRADE BACK TO 35, TRADE TO\n50, DRIVE PEOPLE CRAZY. I WISH WE'D HAVE SEEN IT QUIETLY\nMUCH MORE SUSTAINEDLY RALLY INSTEAD OF THE MANNER IN WHICH\nWE'VE DONE IT P. >> GOT IT.\nTHAT IS QUITE A RANGE. THANKS SO MUCH, DENNIS GARTMAN.\nSO WITH THAT SAID, AND WE DID SEE A PULL BACK THIS THE ENERGY\nEQUITIES. SHOULD WE BE CONCERNED?\n>> NO, YOU SHOULD BE LOOK AT A PLACE TO PICK THIS UP LOWER.\nMOST OF THE OIL INDUSTRY ISN'T PROFITABLE AT 50.\nTHERE ARE A HANDFUL OF GUYS THAT COULD ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING AT\n50, BUT OPEC HAS A PROBLEM THE 50.\nIT'S A SELF CORRECTING MECHANISM.\nWE WON'T GO TO 65 OVERNIGHT, BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO 35.\n>> THAT'S THE PROBLEM, I DON'T THINK OPEC HAS A PROBLEM AT\n50RKS WE HAVE A PROBLEM AT 50. BUT THEY WILL CITY PRODUCE.\nBUT I THINK MORE ACCURATE THING IS WHAT DENNIS SAID, THAT\nTRADING RANGE. WE HELD THE APRIL LOW OF 39ISH.\nWE'VE KNOWN ABOUT ALL THIS BEARISHNESS IN THE MARKETPLACE\nAND CRUDE STILL HAS NOT BROKEN. >> I THINK THE MOST INTERESTING\nTHING IS THE GRINDING WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE S&P ALL THE TIME,\nTHIS INCREDIBLY TIGHT RANGE WE'RE IN.\nHOW ABOUT OIL? THE OVX, HERE WE ARE BOUNCING\nOFF OF THE LOWS AND JUST A COUPLE PERCENT ABOVE THAT AND\nMOST OF THAT COMING TODAY. SO WE'RE IN THIS GRIND, WHETHER\nTHE S&P RIGHT NOW AND YOU LOOK AT THE VOLATILITY INDEX BETWEEN\n11 AND 13 EVER SINCE JULY AND YOU LOOK AT THE OVX AND WHERE WE\nTRADE NOW, SEEMS TO ME OIL THIS RANGE WE JUST CONTINUE TO FIND\nTHESE RANGES. >> ISN'T OIL TRADING AT A 20%\nRANGE? >> OR IS IT REALLY TRADING 45 TO\n50 AND THEN FINDING THESE LITTLE AREAS.\nBUT WITHIN THAT AREA, I THINK OVX --\n>> I DON'T TRADE THAT MUCH IN OIL, BUT I LOOK AT THE MOVES AND\nI GET WORRIED ABOUT MY OIL STOCKS.\n>> I'M HOLDING BECAUSE I'VE EVEN THE XLE, I'VE BOUGHT CALLS IN\nTHERE. THERE IS ALSO SOME SERVICE NAMES\nINVOLVED. >> LESS DEPENDENT ON THE\nACTUAL -- EVEN THOUGH IT IS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, BUT YOU HAVE THE\nDIVIDEND, YOU HAVE A YIELD THERE.\nBUT IF YOU LOOK AT A PXD UP 48% YEAR TO DATE, THOSE I THINK YOU\nSELL. >> I THINK WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT\nTHE DOLLAR. THE DOLLAR SOLD OFF 3% IN THE\nLAST MONTH AND THAT REALLY GOT THE CRUDE OIL GOING.\nAND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, WHEN WE HAVE THE FED MEETING\nSEPTEMBER 21, A 26% CHANCE OF A RAISE HERE, IF THE DOLLAR WERE\nTO START TO RALLY AGAIN, I WOULD EXPECT CRUDE TO COME IN.\nBUT I'M WITH YOU, XLE AT 65. >> HOLDING THE 200 DAY MOVING\nAVERAGE. EVER SINCE IT BROKE ABOVE APRIL, IT'S BEEN THERE EVER SINCE.\n>> MYLAN IS MOVING LOWER. >> AND SENATOR CHUCK GRASSLEY\nSENDING A LETTER ASKING FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRICING OF\nEPI PEN, THAT VITALLY IMPORTANT DRUG USED IN ALLERGY\nEMERGENCIES. CITING NBC NEWS REPORTING FROM\nLAST WEEK SHOWING THAT THE COST OF EPI PEN HAS RISEN OVER 400%\nSINCE MYLAN ACQUIRED THE DRUG IN 2007 AND HERE WE HAVE A PRICE GRAPH SHOWING THE PRICE OVER THE\nLAST 5 YEARS. YOU CAN SEE OVER $600 NOW.\nSO CHUCK GRASSLEY JOINING A CHORUS OF OTHER FOLKS LOOKING\nINTO THE PRICING OF THIS ASKING IN HIS LETTER THAT MYLAN EXPLAIN\nTHE CHANGES THAT THEY MADE SINCE THE ACQUISITION THAT CAUSED TO\nINCREASE THE PRICE AND REFLECTS THE VALUE THAT THE PRODUCT\nPROVIDES. THIS FOLLOWS A TWEET LAST WEEK\nFROM BERNIE SANDERS ALSO CRITICIZING THE PRICING SAYING\nTHERE IS NO REASON WHICH IT COSTS MYLAN JUST A FEW DOLLARS\nTO MAKE THAT THE EPI PEN SHOULD COST FAMILIES MORE THAN $600.\nSO THIS WEIGHING ON SHARES AND IT'S A STORY THAT HAS BEEN\nAROUND ALMOST A YEAR, BACK SINCE  HEADLINES.\n>> AND WE SHOULD SAY THAT MYLAN ESSENTIALLY SAID PRICES CHANGED\nOVER TIME TO BETTER REFLECT THE IMPORTANT PRODUCT FEATURES AND\nTHE VALUE THE PRODUCT PROVIDES. SO THEY'RE SAYING THAT'S WHY WE\nSEE THIS 400% INCREASE IN THE PRICE.\nWHATEVER THE REASONS ARE, IT'S GETTING SCRUTINY AND THE STOCK\nIS MOVING. SO WHAT DO WE DO?\n>> I DON'T KNOW. WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF SCRUTINY\nSEEMS LIKE ACTUALLY WE'LL CONTINUE TO HEAR SCRUTINY.\nIT'S POLITICALLY EXPEDIENT. MAKES SENSE EXCEPT FOR THE FACT\nTHAT WE'VE ALSO DIGESTED WHAT THEY CAN DO IN THE SHORT TERM.\nIF YOU LOOK AT THE STOCKS UNDER THE MOST PRESSURE, THEY HAVE\nACTUALLY SHRUGGEDED IT OFF. IF ANYTHING, 285 TO 290.\nI DON'T THINK THIS IS A HEADLINE THAT WILL THROW THE ENTIRE\nSECTOR INTO A TIZZY. MEANWHILE I THINK THE\nPRESIDENTIAL RACE IS MORE FOCUSED ON OTHER THINGS THAN\nTHIS ABOUT THAT. >> HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT MYLAN?\n>> YOU TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE NAMES AND I LOOK AT TEVA AND THE\nMOVES THAT THEY HAVE DONE AND IT'S BEEN A MONSTER.\nMYLAN ALWAYS SEEMS TO BE THE SECONDARY ASPECT.\nSO I'D RATHER BE IN TEVA. >> DO YOU THINK IT WILL PICK UP\nIN TERMS OF A POLITICAL ISSUE? >> I THINK IT IS.\nBUT IF YOU COUPLE THAT WITH ANY TYPE&A HEADLINE, I'M STILL\nIN PFIZER. BUT IF YOU COUPLE IT WITH THE\nM&A, I AGREE 295 SHOULD BE SUPPORT.\nBUT 300 HAS BEEN FORMIDABLE RESISTANCE.\n>> AND WE'LL HAVE MUCH MORE ON M&A LATER ON.\nMEANTIME UP NEXT, THE SOCIAL MEDIA COULD RALLY ANOTHER 20%\nHIGHER FROM HERE. WE'LL GIVE YOU THE NAME AND TELL\nYOU WHAT IS BEHIND THE BULLISH CALL.\nPLUS DRUGS AND MONEY. PFIZER AGREEING TO BUY MEHDI\nVAGS SENDING THE STOCK SOARING. AND LATER, ONE OF THE BULLS ON\nWALL STREET UNVEILS WILL HIS STRATEGY TO BEAT THE MARKET AND\nSOMETHING TO DO WITH THE HUNT FOR YIELDS.\nTOM LEE GIVES US HIS THREE STOCK PICKS HE'S BETTING BIG ON.\nAND LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT OUR TRADERS WERE UP TO THE LAST\nTWO WEEK. A LITTLE FAMILY ACTION HERE.\nBOATING. >> NICE.\n>> PETE IS WORKING ON HIS MUSCLES.\n>> GUN SHOW. >> MUCH MORE WHERE THAT CAME\nFROM. STICK AROUND.                \u00e2\u0099\u00aa",

TRENDING NEGATIVE.\nGUESS WHAT, THAT'S WHY THE FED IS OVERPREDICTING ECONOMIC\nGROWTH AND THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS BEFORE PURSUING AN\nAGGRESSIVE STANCE.

THEY WILL RAISE RATES ONCE THIS\nYEAR AND THEN NEXT YEAR AND NOTHING LIKE WHAT THEY WERE\nTALKING ABOUT LAST YEAR, FOUR RATE HIKES THIS YEAR OR FOUR\nNEXT YEAR.

ONLINE.\nLET'S BRING IN ED WAR MORRIS AND HALIMA KROFT.\nYOU KNOW, A LOT OF TALK ABOUT HOW THE LATEST MOVE, WHETHER\nIT'S THE 20% DECLINE, THE 20% BOUNCE, 9% UP IN WTI CRUDE LAST\nWEEK, HAS BEEN MOSTLY ABOUT INVESTOR POSITIONING, IS THAT\nTHE CASE OR ARE WE SEEING REAL FUNDAMENTAL SUPPLY DEMAND\nFACTORS HERE? >> WE HAVE A POSITION OF\nBASICALLY A RECORD HIGH IN SHORT POSITIONS AND EXPECTED A RALLY\nON THE BACK OF THAT AND STARTED THE SEE I THINK THE DISCUSSION\nOF THE OPEC FREEZE COMING BACK INTO PLAY AND MOVED SENTIMENT.\nI THINK WE'RE WATCHING WHAT HAPPENS IN SEPTEMBER.\nSEEING PRICES MOVE ANOTHER LEG LOWER, I EXPECT OPEC TO CONTINUE\nTO TALK ABOUT ACTION IN SEPTEMBER.\n>> IT IS AN INTERESTING QUESTION, ED.\nDO YOU EXPECT ANYTHING FROM OPEC OTHER THAN TO JUST KEEP PUMPING\nAT THIS POINT? >> NO, NOT REALLY.\nTHERE'S NOTHING TO CHANGE DYNAMICS SINCE LAST APRIL.\nMINISTERS OF MEETING TO DO SOMETHING ELSE AND HAD TO MEET\nAS OPEC AND OBVIOUSLY THOSE WITH A VESTED INTEREST OF TALKING UP\nTHE PRICE ARE DOING IT VERY WELL.\nTHAT'S NO REASON TO EXPECT ANYTHING CHANGED WITHIN OPEC.\n>> WELL, IF THAT'S THE CASE, ED, WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT IN TERMS\nOF CLUES FOR WHAT MIGHT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE NEXT LEG OF\nTHE MARKET? TALK ABOUT CONTINUED HEAVY\nEXPORTS OF DISTILLED PRODUCTS. >> IT'S SOMETHING TO BE\nCONCERNED ABOUT BUT I THINK THE BIG DRIVERS OF THE MARKET TODAY\nWERE EXPECT A NEW SUPPLY OF NIGERIA.\nIRAQ PRODUCTION. ACTUALLY RETURNING TO THE MARKET\nAS PRODUCTION THAT WAS SHUT IN FEBRUARY, A DISPUTE OF GETTING\nPRICE AND RIGHT REVENUE AND THE BAD OR KRG.\nTHAT'S RESOLVED. WE HAVE ANOTHER 150,000 BARRELS\nA DAY. AND THEN TALK THAT LED TO A\nSTRENGTHENING OF THE DOLLAR CERTAINLY PLAYED ITSELF OUT.\nI THINK THIS IS JUST A WAY THAT A MARKET IN TIGHT BALANCE\nRESPONDS TO NEWS ABOUT INCREMENTS OF SUPPLY THAT ARE\nJUST A LITTLE BIT BEARISH AND TOOK THE FROTH OUT OF THE\nMARKET. >> HELIMA, WHEN WE WERE TESTING\n$47 ON CRUDE THIS MORNING, THAT'S WHAT HAD THE MARKET\nWORRIED AND KIND OF NEAR THAT MARKET AGAIN.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS AS WE GO THROUGH ALL OF THESE SUPPLY\nWRIGGLES? IS THERE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE\nDOWNWARD PRESSURE ON THE OIL PRICE?\n>> FOR EXAMPLE, THE NIGERIA SITUATION, PEOPLE STARTED TO\nTHINK, OH MY GOSH, IT'S TURNED. WE HAVE SEEN MULTIPLE CEASE-FIRE\nANNOUNCEMENTS AND THEN WE SEE MORE PRODUCTION ADAGES.\nI DON'T THINK THE FUNDAMENTAL DRIVES OF THE CONFLICT ENDED.\nI EXPECT TO SEE MORE TROUBLE IN THE PRODUCER STATE AND THE\nMARKET TODAY IS ANTICIPATING THAT NEW SUPPLY COMES ON THERE.\nIRAQ, WE HAVE NEW SUPPLY COMING ON AND HOW MUCH MORE CAN THEY DO\nBEYOND 100,000 MORE IN THE PIPELINE IN THE NORTH.\n>> YOU KNOW, IT REMINDS ME BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN SOME\nDISCUSSION IN THE U.S. ABOUT NEW TECHNIQUES THAT THE BIG\nCOMPANIES ARE USING FOR FRACKING AND THIS CHICKEN FOOT TYPE\nFRACKING, ED, AN DIFFERENT APPROACHES.\nIS THE TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION CONTINUING IN A WAY THAT COULD\nBRING EVEN MORE SUPPLY ONLINE HERE?\n>> YEAH. THE REAL BIG UNKNOWN IN THE\nMARKET IS U.S. IS A SWING PRODUCER.\nKIND OF TWO ELEMENTS TO IT. ONE IS THE INVENTORY OF DRILL\nBUT UNCOMPLETED WELLS AND SAW PRODUCERS ABLE TO EDGE IT ABOVE\n50 FOR 20.17 WAY BACK IN MARCH WITH THE 3-MONTH LAG THEY\nSTARTED COMPLETING WELLS AND PRODUCTION STOPPED DECLINING AT\nTHE RATE THAT IT WAS DOING AND NOW WE HAVE DRILLING ACTIVITIES\nUP FOR EIGHT WEEKS IN A ROW AND THEN KICK IN WITH MORE\nPRODUCTION AND THE U.S. IS REALLY THE PLACE TO WATCH THE\nREST OF IT IS MORE OIZ. THE U.S. SEES A GROWTH FROM THE\nCOMPLETION OF UNCOMPLETED WELLS OF 400,000 TO 600,000 BARRELS A\nDAY AND THEN MORE INTO 2017. NOBODY ELSE, NOT SAUDI ARABIA,\nNOT IRAQ, NOT IRAN, NO OTHER GROUP OF COUNTRIES ACTUALLY CAN\nADD A MILLION BARRELS A DAY TO THE MARKET THE WAY THE U.S.\nCOULD SO THAT'S THE AREA TO WATCH INTO 2017.\n>> JUST TO WRAP THIS TOGETHER, WE HAVE MOSTLY TALKED ABOUT\nPOTENTIAL FOR INCREMENTAL SUPPLY COMING ON.\nMAYBE NOBODY REALLY EXPECTING ANYTHING IN THE WAY OF CUTS FROM\nOPEC. AND YET THE CRUDE PRICE, FOR\nEXAMPLE, GONE BACK TO WHERE IT WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY\nLAST THURSDAY SO I MEAN, IS THERE SORT OF A BUYING MOMENTUM\nTO THIS MARKET? ARE WE GOING TO BE TESTING THE\n$50 MARKET JUST BECAUSE OF HOW RESILIENT THE MARKET IS?\n>> WE THINK THE MARKET WILL BE CHOPPY.\nWE THINK IT COULD BE BETWEEN 45 AND A 55.\nWE EXPECT IT IN THE MID-50s ENDING YEAR BUT YOU CAN HAVE\nDAYS WITH THE BEARISH STORIES OF THE DOLLAR WEIGHING ON PRICES\nAND THEN YOU HAVE TO WATCH OTHER PRODUCERS LIKE VENEZUELA DOWN\n230,000 BARRELS YEAR ON YEAR. THEY COULD HAVE PROTESTS THERE\nAND THE MARKET WILL GO BACK AN FORTH AND CHOPPY UNTIL THE END\nOF THE YEAR. >> ALL RIGHT.\nTHANK YOU BOTH. TRYING TO ILLUMINATE WHAT'S\nHAPPENING WITH THE SWINGS IN CRUDE OIL TODAY.\nLET'S GET TO CONTRIBUTOR MICHAEL FARR WITH HOLLY LIST AND KEITH\nBLISS. WELCOME TO EVERYBODY.\nMICHAEL, WHAT ARE YOU TELLING INVESTORS TO DO IN THIS\nENVIRONMENT? YOU HAVE STOCK PRICES NEAR\nALL-TIME HIGHS, FIXED INCOME PRICES NEAR AMAZING HIGHS HERE.\nWE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE SWINGS IN COMMODITIES.\nWHAT IS YOUR ADVICE? >> MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU\nOWN AND ALSO REMEMBER THAT WE'VE BEEN IN REALLY EXPENSIVE MARKETS\nBEFORE. A LOT OF THIS FEELS LIKE 1998 OR\n1999 WHEN STUFF WAS KIND OF STUPIDLY EXPENSIVE.\nBUT IT KEPT GETTING MORE EXPENSIVE.\nSO THIS CAN LAST FOR A WHILE. BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO\nUNDERSTAND WHAT YOU OWN, WHY YOU OWN IT AND THE FUNDAMENTALS AND\nBALANCE SHEETS ARE STRONG BECAUSE IT'S THE WEAKER NAMES\nWITH WEAKER BALANCE SHEETS THAT TEND TO TANK MORE WHEN MARKETS\nREVERSE. >> HOLLY, I THINK A LOT OF\nPEOPLE LIKE TO BE GETTING BACK TO BALANCE SHEETS AND INDIVIDUAL\nCORPORATE DRIVERS AND THIS IS A FEW DAYS TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE\nMIGHT HEAR OUT OF JANET YELLEN AT JACKSON HOLE AND THE FED\nCHATTER KICKED UP AGAIN. WHAT DO YOU THINK WE -- I GUESS\nTHE MARKETS WANT TO HEAR OUT OF JANET YELLEN.\nSEEMS LIKE LARGELY A JUDGMENT CALL.\nYOU ARE MARSHAL THE EVIDENCE IN EITHER DIRECTION OF A RATE HIKE\nSEPTEMBER OR NOT AT ALL. WHAT DO YOU THINK THE MARKET\nPRICED IN HERE? >> RIGHT NOW, MIKE, THE MARKET\nHAS NOT PRICED IN ANY FED HIKES FOR SEPTEMBER, THIS YEAR OR\nPRIMARILY EVEN 2017. SO I THINK JANET YELLEN'S REALLY\nGOING TO SET THE STAGE FOR HOW THE MARKET MOVES GOING FORWARD\nCLEARLY. SHE IS GOING TO COME OUT ON THE\nHAWKISH SIDE LIKE THE REGIONAL FED PRESIDENTS HAVE BEEN\nRECENTLY AN START REFERENCING INFLATION THAT IT'S PICKING UP,\nMIGHT BE BEHIND THE 8 BALL IN THAT AND JUST LOOK AT THE\nINFLATION TYPE OF NUMBERS SINCE THEY HIKED RATES BACK IN\nDECEMBER OF LAST YEAR. CLEARLY, THEY'RE ALL HIGHER THAN\nTHEY WERE THEN SO YOU CAN MAKE THE CASE THAT THEY'RE GONG TO\nRAISE RATES SOON. HOWEVER, IF YOU LOCK AT SOME\nMORE OF THE FED GOVERNORS WHICH COME OUT MORE ON THE DOVISH\nSIDE, THEN YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK AT POTENTIAL LABOR SLACK AND THE\nPRODUCTIITY NUMBERS ENDOWN THREE CONSECUTIVE MONTHS IN A\nROW AND TAKING A WAIT AND SEE TYPE OF ATTITUDE.\nSHE IS REALLY GOING TO SET THE STAGE FOR GOING FORWARD NEXT FEW\nMONTHS AND THE MARKETS NOT PRICED FOR ANY HIKES LET ALONE\nEVEN ONE COMING UP IN SEPTEMBER. >> ON THAT POINT, KEITH ABOUT\nPRODUCTIVITY, THE VICE CHAIR STANLEY FISCHER SPOKE OVER THE\nWEEKEND SAYING, LOOK, YOU HAVE TO LOOK TO FISCAL AND REGULTORY\nTO FIX THIS. >> YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT FOR HIS\nWORD AND SETTING THE STAGE WITH THE OTHER FED PRESIDENTS LIKE\nWILLIAMS AND LOCK HART AND BULLARD WITH THEIR STATEMENTS.\nTHEY'RE REALLY VERY GOOD AT JAWBONING THE MARKET AND\nFLOATING OUT THE TRIAL BALLOONS TO SEE HOW THE MARKET WILL REACT\nAND WE HAVE SEEN WE HAVE NOT REACTING.\nTHE EQUITIES TRADING IN A TIGHT RANGE.\nFIXED INCOME IS LOFTY. THE 10-YEAR YIELD BARELY BUDGED\nAT ALL. I THINK THEY TAKE THE CUE AND\nSAY IT'S OKAY TO RAISE IT 25 BASIS POINTS AND THAT IMPACTFUL\nTO THE U.S. ECONOMY AND THEN I'LL SAY IF THEY RAISE IN A\nWORLD OF REDUCED INTEREST RATES AROUND THE GLOBE IN THE MAJOR\nMARKETS, LOOSE MONETARY POLICY, IT IS BULLISH FOR U.S. EQUITIES.\nSEARCHING FOR YIELD, WE'RE IN A WORLD RIGHT NOW WHERE YOU HAVE\n40% OF THE S&P 500 COMPANIES NOW GIVE YOU A HIGHER YIELD THAN THE\n30-YEAR BOND HERE IN THE U.S. AND 60% HIGHER YIELD THAN THE\n10-YEAR NOTE AND CONTINUE TO SEE THIS TYPE OF REACTION.\nINDEED, HERE TODAY, THE EARLY IMBALANCES THAT WE HAVE ON THE\nBUY SIDE AT A HIGH NUMBER AND WE SHOULD SEE A POP OF THE MARKET\nGOING INTO THE END. >> YOU SAY --\n>> GO AHEAD. >> IT'S PARAMOUNT YOU SAY TO\nKNOW WHAT YOU OWN. WHAT WOULD YOU PREFER TO OWN AND\nOWN IN THIS WORLD AS KEITH SAYS OF SCARCE YIELD AND GROWTH?\n>> RIGHT. I WAS TO MAKE A POINT ON HOLLY\nSAYING ABOUT JANET YELLING SETTING THE TONE.\nMARKET FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND CERTAINLY THIS YEAR STILL MOVING\nON WHATEVER THE FED DOES SO IT'S THE WHOLE STORY BEHIND THE\nMARKET AND OUR OPINION IS MONETARY POLICY.\nI LIKE TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHERE THINGS HAVEN'T BEEN MOVING AND\nTHE CONTROVERSY ABOUT THE BANKS, I THINK AT ONE TIME'S BOOK AND\nCLOSE TO ONE TIME'S TANGIBLE BOOK THESE THINGS LOOK PRETTY\nCHEAP. THE FED STRESS TEST SAID THEY'RE\nSOUND. BALANCE SHEETS IN VERY GOOD\nORDER AND DIVIDENDS ARE SOLID. AS RATES DO GO BACK UP, WHENEVER\nTHEY GO BACK UP, BANKS ARE POSITIONED THE SHOW VALUE HERE.\nSOME OF THE VOLATILE NAMES I PROBABLY WOULDN'T OWN.\nSOME OF THE UTILITIES, REITS, OTHERS THAT HAVE DONE SO WELL SO\nFAR IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2016. PROBABLY A GOOD PLACE TO LOOK\nFOR SOME PROFITS AND FIND THOSE COMPANIES THAT PEPSI COLAS OF\nTHE WORLD TO GET YOU THROUGH IN A MORE SOLID WI.\n>> WE'LL HAVE TO SEE ABOUT KOBE BRYANT'S INVESTMENT IDEAS.\n>> CONCENTRATING ON THE PRIVATE THINGS AND GREAT THINGS OF\nNIKE'S CEO AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT. >> HOLLY, HOW BIG OF AN\nINFLUENCE IS THE DOLLAR? SOUNDS LIKE PEOPLE TRYING TO\nMAKE SENSE 0 OF WHEN'S GOING THE MAKE IT STRONG OR WEEK AT THIS\nPOINT. >> WELL, IT'S WHICH COMES FIRST\nTHE CHICKEN OR THE EGG? THE DOLLAR PULLED BACK EARLY BUT\nSEEING A STRONG DOLLAR KEEPS US FROM IMPORTING INFLATION INTO\nTHE U.S. AND SO THAT IS ALLOWING THE FED TO NOT RAISE RATINGS AS\nQUICKLY OR AS STRONG AS THEY MAY WANT TO GIVEN A WEAK DOLLAR AND\nTHE STRONG DOLLAR PROCEEDS THE FED FROM DOING ANYTHING IN HERE.\nNOW, SHOULD WE SEE THE DOLLAR WEAKEN AND GIVE THE FED THE\nEXCUSE THEY'RE LOOKING FOR TO START RAISING RATES BUT AS LONG\nAS WE'RE NOT REALLY SEEING THAT AND PLUS LOOK AT THE BRITISH\nPOUND, THAT IS WEAKENING IN GENERAL SINCE THE BREXIT VOTE\nAND COULD CONTINUE AND IF YOU HAVE THAT AS A COUNTPARTY TO THE\nU.S. THAT KEEPS OUR DOLLAR STRONG VIS-A-VIS THE POUND AND\nCOULD KEEP THE FED AT BAY AND 10-YEAR RATES AND REALLY THE\nENTIRE CURVE JUST SORT OF STAGNATING HERE AND DOESN'T GIVE\nTHE FED IMPETUS TO RAISE RATES EITHER, KELLY.\nIF ANYTHING YOU WANT TO BE MORE INVESTED IN THE SHORT CURVE THAN\nTHE LONG END OR MORE OF THE LONG CURVE OF THE U.S. RELATIVE TO\nGERMANY, JAPAN, SWITZERLAND ALL SEEING NEGATIVE RATES.\n>> A LITTLE INTERESTING -- >> PEOPLE --\n>> DOING THE OPPOSITE. THAT'S THE FED STARTING TO SAY\nTHAT, TOO. EARS PRICKED FOR HOW YELLEN\nTALKS ABOUT INFLATION. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.\n>> THANK YOU. >> APPRECIATE IT.\nKICKING OFF THE DISCUSSION THIS",

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, BIGGEST\nSELLOFF. $6.3 BILLION.\nAND THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE KIND OF SELLING OUT.\n>> I FIND IT INTERESTING, MIKE. TECH IS BECOMING MORE APPEALING\nAND GROWTH AND DIVIDENDS AND NOT PRICED LIKE 1999.\nWHY DO YOU THINK IT'S OUT OF FAVOR?\n>> I DOUBT THAT HEDGE FUNDS, INDIVIDUALLY OR AS A GROUP SAID,\nYOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE TO DO TODAY?\nSELL BIG MEGA CAP TECH BUT CASE BY CASE, IF YOU WANT TO HAVE AN\nEDGE ON THAT COMPANY, PROBABLY THINK IT'S A LIMITED WINDOW.\nRALLIES.

IT'S TOO OPAQUE TO KNOW WHAT\nTHEY'RE DOING AND DEFINITELY DOING IS MOING OUT OF SECTORS\nAND TOP TEN ACTIVIST HEDGES WE LOOK AT AND MOVING OUT OF THERE\nAND WE DON'T KNOW WHERE. MAYBE IN CASH OR GOLD BUT A\nMUTED SENTIMENT TOWARD THE STOCK MARKETS.\nNOT SO CONFIDENT ABOUT IT. >> WE HAVE HEARD BEAR ITCHNESS\nOF BIG INVESTORS OF THE MARKET OVERALL.\nWHERE IF ANYWHERE WERE THEY BUYING?\nWHERE DID YOU SEE IT PICK UP? >> CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY.\n1.5 BILLION WORTH OF NET BUYS AND THEN ENERGY.\nENERGY ACTUALLY DONE QUITE WELL IN THE SORT OF SIX MONTHS.\nCHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, THAT WAS A TOP BUY FOR THESE HEDGE FUNDS.\nTHIRD POINT, WENT IN THERE QUITE STRONGLY.\nBUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MAGNITUDE, THEY'RE NOT THERE.\nWE SAW 2014, 2015, TOP FIVE BUYS FOR THE HEDGE FUNDS, ALL BILLION\nPLUS, 4 BILLION, 5 BILLION. YOU LOOK AT THE SELL SIDE,\nTHEY'RE A COUPLE OF BILLION EACH AND STILL NOT GOING BACK INTO\nTHE MARKETS LIKE THEY WERE IN 2014 AND BEGINNING OF 2015.\n>> TIM? >> I THINK HEDGE FUND MANAGERS\nCONSIDER THEMSELVES MILDLY CONTRARIAN.\nTHE APPLE MOVE IS ONE WHERE THE STOCK DOWN 93.\nTRADED UP TO 110 IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND THEN YOU WANT TO GET\nOUT. THIS IS A MEGA CAP NAME WHERE IF\nYOU'RE ABLE TO GET ANYWHERE HALF OR THREE QUARTERS OF THAT MOVE\nYOU SELL AN ENLOOKING FOR THE NEXT ONE SO I THINK THIS IS\nREALLY JUST ABOUT ROTATION AND OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN\nCONCERNED ABOUT THE CROWDED TRADES AND THE HEDGE FUND SPACE\nAND SHOULD BE BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF GUYS TRADED\nACCORDING TO THE SAND PAT AND ONLY SO MUCH CAPACITY IN THE BIG\nTRADE AND DOESN'T DO MUCH FOR US TO LOOK BACK WARD.\nWHAT ARE THE TRADES TO BE PICKING UP STEAM?\nI THINK THE FINANCIALS IS A PLACE THAT'S STARTING TO SEE\nTHAT. >> WE'RE HAPPY FOR THEM TO TELL\nUS SHOULD THEY CHOOSE TO. BUT NO.\nFACEBOOK BUCKED THE TREND AGAIN. AN AREA IN TERMS OF TECH WE SAW\nPEOPLE WHO WERE DOING MORE BUYING.\n>> ABSOLUTELY. THIRD POINT 400 MILLION.\nTHEY REALLY LIKE FACEBOOK AND ALWAYS BUCKING THE TREND.\n6.3 BILLION WORTH OF NET SALES FOR THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY\nAND NOT FACEBOOK.

WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IS THE OTHER\nDETAILS. DONALD TRUMP HAD A MAJOR\nIMMIGRATION SPEECH SCHEDULED FOR THURSDAY.\nTHAT HAS NOW BEEN POSTPONED, AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING PUBLICLY IS\nWHAT'S GOING ON BEHIND THE SCENES PRIVATELY.\nTHERE'S A LOT OF TALK AND DEBATE ABOUT WHAT THE FINAL APPROACH TO\nIMMIGRATION WOULD BE. DONALD TRUMP VERY HARD-LINE ON\nISSUES. BUT HIS TEAM COGNIZANT OF THE\nFACT THAT THEY NEED TO SOFTEN IF NOT THE POLICY THAN THE MESSAGE,\nIF THEY ARE TO ACHIEVE OUTREACH TO ENOUGH VOTERS TO WIN IN\nNOVEMBER. YOU'RE SEEING A LOT OF SHIFTING\nMESSAGES BACK AND FORTH, DEPENDING ON THE ADVISERS THAT\nYOU TALK TO, BUT AT LEAST THE WALL, FOR SURE, IS IN.\n>> DID YOU GUYS CALL EACH OTHER? YOU'RE WEARING THE SAME THING.\nYOU GUYS LOOK EXACTLY, YOUR OUTFITS LOOK EXACTLY THE SAME.\nBUT JEFF, YOU WERE COVERING HILLARY CLINTON TODAY HE GOT\nUNWELCOME NEWS REGARDING HER E-MAILS.\n>> JUST WHEN YOU THINK THIS E-MAIL CONTROVERSY IS DONE, IT'S\nNOT. A FEDERAL JUDGE IN WASHINGTON\nRULED THAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAS TO ACCELERATE THE RELEASE OF\nDOCUMENTS THAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN. THIS IS ALL PART OF THE FBI\nINVESTIGATION. THEY TURNED THESE UP IN THEIR\nYEAR-LONG INVESTIGATION OF THAT PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER THAT SHE\nUSED AS SECRETARY OF STATE. NOW THE FBI HAS LOOKED AT THESE,\nSO THERE WON'T BE ANY NEW EXAMPLES OF CRIMINAL WRONGDOING,\nBUT THE PUBLIC HAS NOT LOOKED AT THEM.\nWE HAVE NOT LOOKED AT THEM. SO THIS WILL DEFINITELY BE A\nQUESTION HERE, A, WHY DIDN'T THEY TURN THEM OVER, AND B, WHAT\nIS CONTAINED IN THEM. SO JUST WHEN THEY THINK THEY'RE\nTURNING THE CORNER, THEY ARE NOT HERE.\nAND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF THAT DECISION TO USE A PRIVATE E-MAIL\nSERVER BACK AT THE BEGINNING OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.\n>> IT'S ALSO FODDER FOR HER OPPONENT, DONALD TRUMP, HERE'S\nWHAT HE SAID TONIGHT ABOUT IT. >> HILLARY CLINTON SAID SHE\nTURNED OVER ALL OF HER WORK-RELATED E-MAILS.\n[ CROWD CHANTING \"LOCK HER UP\" ] SHE TESTIFIED TO CONGRESS, UNDER\nPENALTY OF PERJURY. NOW WE LEARN ABOUT ANOTHER\n15,000 E-MAILS SHE FAILED TO TURN OVER, AND THEY'VE JUST BEEN\nDISCOVERED, I GUESS, TODAY. >> YEAH, IS THAT TRUE?\nBECAUSE IT'S DOCUMENTS. THEY DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE\nDUPLICATES. IS THIS STATEMENT TRUE?\n>> NO, THE STATEMENT WAS NOT TRUE.\nA, THEY WERE NOT TURNED OVER TODAY.\nTHE FBI TURNED THEM OVER TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT IN JULY,\nACTUALLY, AFTER THEIR YEAR-LONG INVESTIGATION, AND WE DON'T KNOW\nHOW MANY OF THEM ARE NEW OR DUPLICATES.\nBUT THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS TELLING US THAT THEY BELIEVE\nMANY, MANY OF THEM ARE NEW. WE HAVE NOT YET SEEN THEM, SO\nTHE CHALLENGE HERE FOR DONALD TRUMP, OBVIOUSLY, HIS CROWD IS\nCHANTING \"LOCK THEM UP, LOCK THEM UP.\"\nIT GETS THE BASE GOING AND THE CLINTON BASE GOING, BECAUSE THEY\nARE SICK OF THIS E-MAIL TALK. BERNIE SANDERS FAMOUSLY SAID\n\"ENOUGH OF THE DAMN E-MAILS.\" BUT IT MAY BE THOSE VOTERS IN\nTHE MIDDLE TURNED OFF BY DONALD TRUMP, OR ON THE CUSP OF HOLDING\nTHEIR NOSE AND VOTING FOR HILLARY CLINTON WHO MAYBE HAVE\nQUESTIONS WITH THIS. THAT'S WHY THEY'RE NOT HAPPY\nWITH THIS NEWS. THE FEDERAL JUDGE RULED TODAY\nTHAT THESE 15,000 E-MAILS MUST BE RELEASED STARTING IN A MONTH\nOR SO, SO THIS IS NOT GOING TO GO AWAY.\nTHIS IS GOING TO BE A DRIP, DRIP, DRIP UNTIL ELECTION DAY.\n>> IT'S NOT A GOOD WEEK FOR HER STARTING OFF, BECAUSE HE\nCONTINUES TO ACCUSE HER OF USING HER POSITION TO DO FAVORS FOR\nCLINTON FOUNDATION DONORS. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT?\n>> THAT DEFINITELY IS AN ACCUSATION, BUT SO FAR, ALL OF\nOUR INVESTIGATIONS HAVE NOT SHOWN ANY EXAMPLES OF CONCRETE\nFAVORS. OUR COLLEAGUE, DREW GRIFFIN HAS\nBEEN INVESTIGATING THE FOUNDATION.\nTHERE ARE QUESTIONS FOR SURE ABOUT ACCESS THAT MEMBERS HAD.\nMEETINGS WITH THE SECRETARY, BUT THERE IS NO EXACT EVIDENCE WE'VE\nBEEN ABLE TO FIND OF A QUID PRO QUO, BUT THEY ARE SO SENSITIVE\nTO THIS. THEY ARE CHANGING THE RULES OF\nTHE FOUNDATION, SAYING IF SHE IS ELECTED PRESIDENT THEY WILL NOT\nACCEPT ANY FOREIGN CONTRIBUTIONS, AND THE FORMER\nPRESIDENT WILL STEP DOWN AS PART OF THIS FOUNDATION HERE, BUT\nSOME CRITICS ARE LIKE, WHY SHOULD YOU WAIT UNTIL THE\nELECTION? WHY SHOULDN'T YOU DO THAT RIGHT\nNOW HERE, SO THIS FOUNDATION AND THE E-MAILS, THEY ARE LINKED.\nTHEY ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE FODDER FOR MANY QUESTIONS AND\nMUCH CRITICISM BETWEEN NOW AND ELECTION DAY.\n>> IT'S THE OLD SELF-INFLICTED WOUNDS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.\nTHANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT JEFF AND PHIL.\nAPPRECIATE IT. I WANT TO BRING IN BETSY McCOY\nWHO IS SUPPORTING DONALD TRUMP AND KAYLEIGH MAcENANY.\nFI DONALD TRUMP HAS SAID IN NO\nUNCERTAIN TERMS THAT 11 MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS HAVE TO BE\nDEPORTED. SOME QUESTION, DO YOU THINK HE'S\nBACKING OFF NOW? >> I'LL TELL YOU WHAT HE'S\nDOING, THIS IS THE NATURAL EVOLUTION.\nHE'S MADE IT CLEAR THERE WILL BE A WALL.\nNO SURPRISE ABOUT THAT. EVERY NATION HAS A RIGHT AND AN\nOBLIGATION TO ENFORCE ITS BORDERS.\nAND SADLY, THE UNITED STATES HAS FAILED TO DO THAT IN THE PAST,\nAND THAT HAS CREATED AN ENORMOUS ECONOMIC BURDEN, PARTICULARLY\nFOR LABOR IN THIS COUNTRY. BUT ON THE OTHER ISSUES, HE\nNEEDS THE COOPERATION OF CONGRESS.\nHE UNDERSTANDS THERE ARE THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT IN THE\nUNITED STATES, AND WHEN HE MET WITH HISPANIC LEADERS THIS\nWEEKEND IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO MAP OUT A\nPRACTICAL WAY, AND HE'S ALWAYS USED THE WORDS \"FAIR AND\nHUMANE\", FAIR AND PRACTICAL AND HUMANE WAY TO DEAL WITH ILLEGAL\nIMMIGRATION, BUT I WOULD SAY THIS, MORE THAN ANYTHING ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP'S APPROACH TO IMMIGRATION.\nIT IS NOT RACIAL. IT IS BASED ON TWO THINGS.\nECONOMICS AND PUBLIC SAFETY. >> OKAY.\nBUT MY QUESTION IS, HE'S NOT, HIS INITIALLY HE SAID WE WOULD\nHAVE THEM DEPORTED AND THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO COME BACK IN,\nTALKING ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, AND NOW IT'S YET TO\nBE DETERMINED. I'M GOING TO PLAY THIS AND THEN\nWE CAN TALK ABOUT IT. >> AS THE WEEKS UNFOLD HE WILL\nLAY OUT THE SPECIFICS OF THAT PLAN THAT HE WOULD IMPLEMENT AS\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. >> WOULD THAT INCLUDE WHAT YOU\nHEARD IN THE SOUND BITE AND THAT HE TALKED ABOUT DURING THE\nREPUBLICAN PRIMARIES. >> TO BE DETERMINED.\n>> IT WAS A DEPORTATION FORCE AT FIRST HE SAID, AND NOW HE'S\nSAYING MAYBE NOT. >> THAT WOULD REQUIRE ACTION BY\nCONGRESS AS WELL, SO NATURALLY, AS YOU MOVE FORWARD IN A\nCAMPAIGN AND TALK TO ALL THE CONSTITUENTS.\n>> TO MOVE FORWARD OR AS HE'S LEARNED BETTER?\n>> NO, I THINK, AS YOU MOVE FORWARD, IN THE PRIMARY PROCESS,\nHE MAPPED OUT HIS VALUES. HE MADE IT CLEAR THAT ENFORCING\nTHE BORDER AND PREFERRING LEGAL IMMIGRATION WAS HIS VALUES.\nTHAT'S WHAT HE PRESENTED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\nAND, AS I SAID, HE STRONGLY BELIEVES THAT EVERY NATION ON\nEARTH HAS A RIGHT AND OBLIGATION TO ENFORCE ITS BORDERS AND\nDETERMINE WHO COMES IN. >> OKAY.\nI WAS GOING TO GET TO KAYLEIGH, BUT ANNE, I KNOW YOU'RE RARING\nTO GET IN. WHAT DID YOU WANT TO SAY?\n>> FRANKLY, I WAS JUST LISTENING TO WHAT SHE WAS SAYING.\nI HAVE A HARD TIME REACTING TO WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO\nSAY, BECAUSE I THINK NONE OF US KNOW WHAT HE IS GOING TO SAY.\nIN FACT, I DON'T THINK HE KNOWS WHAT HE IS GOING TO SAY, WHICH\nIS WHY THAT IMMIGRATION SPEECH WAS POSTPONED.\nKELLYANNE CONWAY IS A VERY DECENT HUMAN BEING.\nSHE HAS BEEN IN REPUBLICAN POLITICS FOR A REALLY LONG TIME,\nAND SHE HAS POLLED THIS IMMIGRATION ISSUE BACK AND\nFORTH. SHE HAS BEEN AN ADVOCATE FOR\nIMMIGRATION REFORM. SHE TRIED TO CONVINCE\nREPUBLICANS TO GET IT PASSED, BECAUSE SHE KNEW IT WAS THE\nDEFENSIBLE THING TO DO NOT ONLY FROM A HUMAN PERSPECTIVE BUT\nFROM A POLITICAL PERSPECTIVE. SHE'S GOT A VERY TOUGH CAT TO\nSKIN IN THE SENSE THAT DRUMONAL TRUMP HAS BASED A LARGE PART OF\nHIS CAMPAIGN ON BUILDING A WALL, BASHING HISPANICS.\nSO HOW DOES HE BALANCE THIS? HOW DOES HE BALANCE THIS\nIMMIGRATION ISSUE THAT ON THE ONE HAND MAKES SENSE TO PIVOT ON\nDURING A GENERAL ELECTION, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, IT'S WHAT A\nLOT OF OFHIS BASE REALLY LIKES. THIS ONE ISSUE THAT HE HAS LASER\nFOCUS ON FOR THE LAST YEAR OR PLUS.\n>> THAT IS REALLY THE CONUNDRUM THAT THE CAMPAIGN FACES AS THEY\nGO THROUGH. BECAUSE THE LIEUTENANT\nGOVERNOR'S SAYING NO, I GUESS THIS IS A SORT OF A PIVOT THAT\nHE'S LEARNING THAT YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH CONGRESS AND DO THESE\nTHINGS, BUT INITIALLY, AS WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR A YEAR TALKING\nABOUT THIS, HE SAID THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO AND THEN COME BACK,\nYOU DON'T THINK THIS IS A CHANGE IN POLICY?\n>> I DO THINK IT'S A CHANGE, BUT IN THE MARCH DEBATE DONALD TRUMP\nSAID SOMETHING THAT WAS VERY SMART.\nHE SAID GREAT LEADERS ARE FLEXIBLE.\nYOU HAVE TO BE FLEXIBLE ON THE MARGINS OF YOUR POLICY.\nWHAT REPUBLICAN VOTERS CARE ABOUT IS NOT SENDING ILLEGAL\nIMMIGRANTS OUT OF THIS COUNTRY. THEY CARE ABOUT HAVING A SECURE\nBORDER. THEY CARE ABOUT NOT HAVING\nCRIMINAL ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ON THE STREET.\nDONALD TRUMP SAID WE'RE STILL GOING TO BUILD THE WALL, BUT\nWE'RE NOT GOING TO DO WITH THIS DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION HAS\nDONE WHICH IS LET OUT 19,700 CRIMINAL IMMIGRANTS ON THE\nSTREET, 200 WITH MURDER CONVICTIONS.\nTHAT IS THE CONTRAST THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS PUT FORWARD.\nHE CHANGED ON THIS, AND I THINK IT WAS A GOOD THING HE CHARGED\nON THE MARGIN OF THIS POLICY. >> I WANT TO GET ONE MORE ANSWER\nFROM ANNA. WHILE WE'RE ON THE SUBJECT OF\nIMMIGRATION AND HISPANIC VOTERS, HE MAELT WITH HISPANIC ADVISERS\nDO YOU THINK HE IS TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO PACIFIC IVOT TOWA\nCENTER. >> I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HE'S\nTRYING TO DO. I THINK HE'S SEEING THE POLLS\nAND THAT HE IS IN THE TEENS WITH HISPANICS, AND THAT IS BAD IN\nSOME STATES LIKE IN FLORIDA, IT IS FRANKLY TOO LITTLE TOO LATE.\nFOR 14, 15 MONTHS, DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN BASHING HISPANICS.\nHE LAUNCHED HIS CAMPAIGN BY CALLING MEXICANS RAPISTS, BY\nSAYING THEY BROUGHT CRIME, AND YES THERE WERE SOME GOOD PEOPLE.\nHE WENT AFTER THE JUDGE BECAUSE OF HIS MEXICAN HERITAGE.\nHE KICKED J A RECORDER OUT OF A CONFERENCE.\nTHIS IS SOMETHING THAT TAKES A LIFE-LONG COMMITMENT.\nTHAT CERTAINLY TAKES A LONG STRUCTURE.\nNOW I WILL TELL YOU, I DO THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE\nTHAT HISPANICS LIKE AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE NOT ONE\nHOMO GENUS BLOB. AND I THINK HE'S BURNT THE\nBRIDGES. >> I DON'T THINK HE HAS BURNT\nTHE BRIDGES. THERE'S A LARGE HISPANIC\nCOMMUNITY IN OUR COUNTRY WHO OBEY THE LAW, THEY ARE\nHARDWORKING PEOPLE, THEY WANT TO SEE ECONOMIC SUCCESS IN THIS\nCOUNTRY, AND FOR THOSE PEOPLE AS FOR MANY OTHER AMERICANS, THEY\nUNDERSTAND THAT IMMIGRATION IS NOT A RACIAL ISSUE.\nIT'S AN ECONOMIC ISSUE. LOOK AT OUR NORTHERN BORDER TO\nCANADA. >> I JUST HAVE TO --\n>> JUST A MOMENT. LOOK AT OUR NORTHERN BORDER OF\nCANADA WHICH WELCOMES IN MORE IMMIGRANTS PROPORTIONALLY.\nED BUT THEY HAVE A RULE. IF YOU CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT YOU\nCAN MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO THE ECONOMY, THAT YOU ARE\nSELF-SUFFICIENT, THAT YOU ARE EDUCATED AND HAVE SKILLS AND CAN\nSUPPORT YOUR FAMILY, WELCOME IN, AND THAT SHOULD BE THE RULE IN\nTHE UNITED STATES. >> IF'S NOT RACIAL, THAT'S WHY\nDONALD TRUMP HAS SUGGESTED A WALL WITH CANADA.\n>> I KNOW. I JUST THINK THAT THE LIEUTENANT\nGOVERNOR IS COMPLETELY WRONG WHEN SHE STATES THIS HASN'T BEEN\nRACIAL WHATSOEVER. DONALD TRUMP'S PATTERN IN\nIMMIG IMMIGRATION POLICY OFF THE WET\nBACK POLICY. AND WHEN HE OPENED HIS CAMPAIGN\nHE TALKED ABOUT MEXICANS BEING RAPISTS.\n>> THERE IS A LOT OF ILLEGALITY ON THAT BORDER AND\nUNFORTUNATELY, ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE THE VICTIMS OF\nIT. >> UNFORTUNATELY, ALL OF THOSE\nHARD-WORKING IMMIGRANTS THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT A MOMENT AGO HAVE\nNOT BEEN SOMETHING THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS UTTERED.\nWHEN WE TALKED ABOUT HIS SPEECH AT THE CONVENTION, WHICH WAS\nSUPPOSED TO SET THE TONE FOR THE LAST FEW MONTHS IN THIS\nCANDIDACY, IN THIS CAMPAIGN, HE DIDN'T MENTION ONE POSITIVE\nIMAGE OF A HISPANIC PERSON, IMMIGRANT, NOT ONE.\nINSTEAD, IT WAS DESPERATION, DOOM AND DESPAIR.\nEVERY PERSON OF COLOR IS ONE OF A CRIMINAL BACKGROUND WHO HAS AN\nAFFINITY TO BREAK THE LAW. >> THAT'S NOT AT ALL.\n>> YOU SAID THAT IMMIGRATION IS GOOD, HE SAID HE WANTS THEM TO\nCOME THE RIGHT WAY. THERE ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS WHO\nHAVE LOST THEIR LIVES BECAUSE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WERE LET OUT.\nAND KATE STEINLE IS ONE OF THEM.",

MOMENTS AGO, NEW TRUMP HIRE\nKELLYANNE CONWAY SPOKE TO FOX' MEGYN KELLY TO GIVE DETAILS\nABOUT THE DEPORTATION FORCE TRUMP ENVISIONED AND WHO THEY\nWOULD DEPORT. QUOTE, YOU HAVE TO DEPORT THOSE\nWHO COMMITTED CRIMES. IN OTHER WORDS, NOT ALL 11\nMILLION UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. HE WILL DEPORT THOSE WHO\nABSOLUTELY COMMITTED A CRIME, BEING CONVICTED OF A CRIME, HE\nWILL MAKE SURE THAT AMERICAN JOBS ARE PROTECTED, HE WILL\nABSOLUTELY BUILD THAT WALL. BACK WITH THE PANEL.\nIT IS A CHANGE, EARLY ON DURING THE PRIMARY, DONALD TRUMP WAS\nVERY CLEAR ON THOSE DEBATE STAGES SAYING ALL 11 MILLION,\nTHERE'S GOT TO BE LAW AND ORDER, THERE'S GOT TO BE FAIRNESS IN\nTHE SYSTEM, THE PEOPLE WHO CAME HERE LEGALLY WHO WERE WAITING IN\nLINE, YOU CAN'T REWARD THOSE WHO ARE HERE AND HE SAID THERE WOULD\nBE A DEPORTATION FORCE. >> ANOTHER THING DONALD TRUMP\nSAID BACK IN THE MARCH DEBATE WAS THAT NO GOOD LEADER IS NOT\nFLEXIBLE, THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE FLEXIBLE AND LISTEN AND LEARN\nAND WHEN YOU LEARN SOMETHING, TO CHANGE.\nWHEN YOU NEED TO CHANGE. HE SAT DOWN SATURDAY WITH\nHISPANIC LEADERS, SPOKE WITH THEM AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY\nCAME TO AN UNDERSTANDING THAT THE OVERRIDING PRINCIPLE OF HIS\nCAMPAIGN, WHICH IS BORDER SECURITY, WILL REMAIN THE SAME.\nTHAT THIS IS WHERE THERE NEEDS TO BE A CHANGE.\nCONTRAST THAT WITH DEMOCRATS WITH 19,723 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS\nWHO COMMITTED CRIMES WERE LET BACK OUT INTO SOCIETY, 200\nMURDERERS. THIS IS A STARK CONTRAST FROM\nTHE DEMOCRATS. HE EVOLVED WHERE HE NEEDED TO\nAND I LIKE THE POLICY. >> THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.\nTHE PITCHFORK CROWD THAT WAS LIKE SEND THEM BACK AT THESE\nDONALD TRUMP RALLIES AND MEXICO, WE ARE GOING TO BUILD THE WALL,\nYOU WOULD SEE DONALD TRUMP GET SOME KIND OF RISE OUT OF THE\nCROWD AND HE WOULD LIKE THAT, HE WOULD GET OFF ON IT AT THESE\nRALLIES TALKING ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.\nTHIS WAS HIS BREAD AND BUTTER ISSUE.\nHE WAS A HARDLINER ON IT AND LISTEN, I WORKED ON ILLEGAL\nIMMIGRATION WHEN I WORKED IN CONGRESS FOR SEVEN YEARS.\nI'M A STAUNCH OPPONENT OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND BORDER\nSECURITY HAS TO BE A PRIORITY. I WAS THERE WHEN WE PUSHED BACK\nIN 2007 AGAINST GEORGE BUSH'S AMNESTY PROGRAMS THAT HE WANTED\nTO PUSH THROUGH SO I AM NO SWISH ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.\n>> YOU SEE THIS AS A COMPLETE FLIP-FLOP?\n>> COMPLETE FLIP-FLOP. NOT ONE TIME DURING ALL THOSE\nTHINGS WHEN HE WAS VERY XENOPHOBIC MESSAGING HERE, DID\nHE SAY SPECIFICALLY THE CRIMINALS ARE GOING TO GO.\nHE NEVER SAID THAT. THAT'S THE POSITION THAT MARCO\nRUBIO HAD. >> DURING THE PRIMARY DEBATES,\nTHERE WERE AN AWFUL LOT OF OTHER REPUBLICANS ON THAT STAGE SAYING\nLOOK, THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE. IT'S JUST NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.\nDONALD TRUMP MADE HAY OF IT AND GOT VOTES PROBABLY BECAUSE\nPEOPLE LIKED THE STRENGTH OF THAT POSITION.\n>> HE SAID A COUPLE THINGS. HE NEVER CHANGED.\nHE SAID I'M GOING TO BUILD A WALL.\nTHAT DIDN'T CHANGE. HE SAID IT AGAIN TODAY.\nI WILL BUILD THAT WALL. HE ALSO SAID I WILL BE FAIR AND\nHUMANE TO PEOPLE AND UNDERSTAND HOW THE GOVERNMENT WILL TRY TO\nIDENTIFY THE 11 OR POTENTIALLY 30 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN THE\nCOUNTRY. IF YOU ARE A CONVICTED FELON YOU\nGOT TO GO NO. QUESTION ABOUT IT.\nYOU GOT TO FOLLOW THE RULES TO COME INTO THE COUNTRY.\nMOST OF THE PEOPLE DIDN'T FOLLOW THE RULES IN THE FIRST PLACE.\nNOW THAT THEY ARE CONVICTED FELONS THEY NEED TO GO BACK.\n>> IS THAT THE 11 MILLION? >> HOW IS IT DIFFERENT?\n>> WHAT DONALD TRUMP HAS SAID, HE SAID THIS, HE DOESN'T WANT TO\nSPLIT UP FAMILIES. >> HE SAID THAT.\n>> WHAT WANTS TO DO IS WORK HUMANELY.\nWE KNOW THE IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION AND CUSTOM AND\nBORDER PROTECTION HAVE A GIANT BUREAUCRACY IN FRONT OF THEM\nTHEY DON'T KNOW WHO'S COMING INTO THE COUNTRY.\nUNTIL WE CAN GET THE HANDLE ON HOW MANY ILLEGALS ARE IN THIS\nCOUNTRY WE CAN'T START DEPORTING PEOPLE.\n>> YOU'RE SAYING IT'S NOT A CHANGE OF POSITION.\n>> IS MEXICO PAYING FOR THIS WALL OR NOT?\n>> ABSOLUTELY. >> OKAY.\nLET'S SEE ABOUT THAT. SO THIS IS THE ONE THING I THINK\nIS REALLY IMPORTANT. WE CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT\nUNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE AS IF THEY'RE NOT HUMAN.\nTHAT IS THE FIRST CRIME AGAINST THE HUMANE FACTOR THAT HE\nCONTINUES TO TOUT. I THINK THE OTHER ISSUE IS,\nDONALD TRUMP DID PUT THIS OUT AS SOMETHING THAT HE WAS HARDLINE\nON, HE WASN'T GOING TO CHANGE ON.\nHE ABSOLUTELY DID GET VOTES AS A RESULT.\nEVEN IF HE IS A FLEXIBLE LEADER, WHICH I HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT\nFLEXIBILITY AND LEADERSHIP, I DOUBT THAT THIS IS ONE THING\nTHAT PRIMARY VOTERS THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE COMPROMISING.\n>> I DO WANT TO STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING CAUTIOUS\nHERE IN THAT WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY HEARD DONALD TRUMP OUTLINE HIS\nIMMIGRATION POLICY OR ADJUSTED IMMIGRATION POLICY DIRECTLY FROM\nHIS MOUTH. WE HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN\nTHIS CAMPAIGN LISTENING TO PEOPLE AROUND HIM OR WHO SUPPORT\nHIM AND ADVISE HIM TALKING ABOUT WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO DO\nNEXT AND HE HAS NOT ALWAYS DONE IT.\n>> IT'S A GOOD POINT. HE WAS SUPPOSED TO DO THAT ON\nTHURSDAY. NOW HE'S NO LONGER DOING THAT.\n>> THERE MAY WELL BE A DESIRE ON THE PART OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN\nAND EVEN ON THE PART OF TRUMP HIMSELF TO GET TO A MORE\nELECTABLE PLACE ON IMMIGRATION BUT HOW HE PERSONALLY DOES IT IS\nWHAT THIS ALWAYS COMES DOWN TO. >> SO HE HAS ABSOLUTELY SAID\nTHAT HE WANTS TO DEPORT THE FAMILIES, HE SAYS HE DOESN'T\nWANT TO SPLIT THEM APART. THEY NEED TO ALL GO.\nRIGHT? THE GRANDMOTHER, THE MOTHER, THE\nKIDS, EVERYBODY NEEDS TO GO. THAT WOULD BE A FUNDAMENTAL\nFLIP-FLOP IF THIS IS A CHANGE. NOT ONLY THAT, IT WOULD ACTUALLY\nEQUAL WHAT THE DEMOCRATIC POSITION IS ON IMMIGRATION.\nWHICH -- HANG ON A SECOND. HE HAS -- THE POINT IS WE DON'T\nREALLY KNOW WHAT THE POSITION IS.\nI BELIEVE THAT HE IS SEARCHING FOR A WAY NOT TO GET MORE LATINO\nVOTERS, CERTAINLY NOT TO GET MORE AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS.\nI THINK HE'S GIVEN UP ON THAT. YOU MENTIONED THIS EARLIER.\nI THINK THIS IS A PLOY TO GET WHITE SUBURBAN WOMEN WHO PERHAPS\nCAN THEN THINK OH, PERHAPS HE'S NOT SUCH A RACIST, PERHAPS HE'S\nNOT SUCH A BIGOT IF HE WILL LET SOME IMMIGRANTS STAY HERE.\nHE WANTS TO BE HUMANE ABOUT IT. IT'S A CROCK.\nHE DOESN'T CARE. >> IT'S NO ACCIDENT THAT\nKELLYANNE WENT OUT AND INTRODUCED --\n>> EXACTLY. >> -- THE POLICY ON SUNDAY.\nSHE'S THE SOFTER, GENTLER SIDE OF DONALD TRUMP.\nVERSUS' STEVE BANNON WHO RUNS A WEBSITE THAT IS UNBELIEVABLY\nBIGOTED AGAINST IMMIGRANTS AND EVERYBODY ELSE.\nSOMETHING ELSE REALLY QUICKLY. DONALD TRUMP IN 2012 WENT AFTER\nMITT ROMNEY, CALLED HIM MEAN-SPIRITED FOR HIS\nSELF-DEPORTATION COMMENTS AND IMMIGRATION POLICY.\nHE CALLED IT MANIACAL AND SAID THE DEMOCRATS MAY BE WRONG ON\nPOLICY BUT AT LEAST THEY'RE KIND.\n>> I WANT TO GET THE DONALD TRUMP PERSPECTIVE HERE.\nDO YOU EXPECT TRUMP, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF KELLYANNE CONWAY SAYING\nTHIS TONIGHT AND THAT IT HASN'T COME FROM THE CANDIDATE?\n>> THAT POSITION OF DEPORTING PEOPLE WHO ARE CONVICTED FELONS\nHAS NEVER CHANGED FROM MR. TRUMP.\nWHAT HE SAID HE'S GOING TO DO, AND I THINK WE SHOULD GIVE HIM\nTO DO TO DO IS LAY OUT HIS IMMIGRATION PLAN.\nWE KNOW HE JUST MET WITH THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY.\nHE SAID HE'S GOING TO BUILD A WALL.\nIF YOU ARE A CONVICTED FELON YOU WILL LEAVE THE COUNTRY.\nWE WILL DO IT HUMANELY. HE WILL PUT AMERICANS FIRST FOR\nA CHANGE. LET'S WAIT AND SEE --\n>> IT'S BEEN A YEAR. WHAT'S HE BEEN DOING FOR THE\nLAST YEAR? >> THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL\nMISUNDERSTANDING OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS.\nREPUBLICAN VOTERS AREN'T FOAMING AT THE MOUTH TO DEPORT PEOPLE.\nWHAT REPUBLICAN VOTERS DON'T WANT --\n>> THAT'S TRUE. EXACTLY.\n>> RONALD REAGAN PASSED A BILL THAT PROMISED ENFORCEMENT AND\nPROMISED LEGALIZATION ONLY AFTER ENFORCEMENT.\nTHAT BILL WAS CONTORTED, AMENDMENTS WERE ADDED, WE NEVER\nGOT BORDER SECURITY.

IT USUALLY MEANS STYLISTICALLY.\nYOU HAVE TO BE AUTHENTIC OR VOTERS FIGURE IT OUT RIGHT AWAY.\nWE SEE FIRST HAND WITH HILLARY CLINTON WHEN YOU TRY TO FAKE WHO\nYOU ARE OR TRY TO LISTEN TO POLLSTERS TELL YOU HOW TO SHIFT.\n>> SOME PEOPLE SAID THAT WAS THE MANAFORT, THAT HE WAS\nTRYING TO TELL TRUMP TO BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY THAN TRUMP IS.\nTRUMP IS TRUMP, AND HE WAS TRYING TO REEL HIM IN, AND TRUMP\nDIDN'T LIKE THAT. >> WELL, I THINK WHAT HE DOES\nLIKE IS WINNING, AND YOU SEE THESE POLLS TIGHTENING.\nPART OF THAT IS REALLY A DIRECT PRODUCT OF LAST WEEK.\nI THINK THE BEST WEEK EVER ON THE CAMPAIGN.\nTHE REASON IS HE GAVE FOUR SPEECHES ALL ON SUBSTANCE, LAW\nENFORCEMENT, TAKING THE CASE TO THE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR, AND\nREALLY CHALLENGING HILLARY CLINTON AND THE DEMOCRATS --\n>> BUT WHEN YOU SAY THE POLLS ARE TIGHTENING, CARL CAMERON IS\nREPORTING THAT HE IS BEHIND IN ALL OF THE NATIONAL POLLS SIX TO\nNINE POINTS RIGHT NOW. SIX TO NINE POINTS.\n>> THE REAL CLEAR AVERAGE BALLOT TONIGHT IS ABOUT 5.5, BUT THAT'S\nGOOD. I LIKE BEING THE UNDERDOG.\nI THINK IT LIGHTS A FIRE UNDER A CAMPAIGN TO REALIZE YOU HAVE 77\nDAYS OR SO TO GET IT DONE, WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE.\nTHE OTHER THING WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS REALLY ACCESS AND LEVERAGE\nTHE RESOURCES WE HAVE. THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF\nTALENT IN THAT CAMPAIGN. I'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW MOST AND\nSOON ALL OF THE FOLKS WHO ARE THERE.\nTHESE ARE HARD WORKING, TALENTED PROFESSIONALS, WHO ARE NOT\nHOUSEHOLD NAMES. I'M REALLY GLAD I'M IN THE FOX\nHOLE WITH THEM. AND THEN IT'S ALSO, I THINK, TO\nCHALLENGE HILLARY CLINTON ON SUBSTANCE.\nMEGYN, THE ISSUE SET REALLY MUCH BENEFITS US.\nPEOPLE DON'T WANT OBAMACARE. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT --\n>> BEFORE WE GET THROUGH OUR LAUNDRY LIST OF ISSUES, IS THAT\nWHY MR. TRUMP IS POSTPONING THE IMMIGRATION SPEECH HE WAS GOING\nTO GIVE THIS WEEK SO THAT, YOU KNOW, THE MEDIA, THE AIR TIME\nCAN BREATHE A LITTLE THIS WEEK WITH, LET'S FACE IT, NEWS THAT\nHAS NOT BEEN GOOD FOR HILLARY CLINTON AT ALL?\n>> NO, IT HASN'T. SHE'S ON TRACK TO HAVE HER WORST\nWEEK EVER, AND IT'S ONLY MONDAY. >> IS THAT THE REASON?\n>> NO. >> IS THAT A CAMPAIGN TACTIC?\n>> NO O IT'S NOT A CAMPAIGN TACTIC.\nIT'S FOR A VERY SIMPLE REASON. THAT'S BEEN ON THE SCHEDULE FOR\nA WHILE. IMMIGRATION IS A VERY COMPLEX\nISSUE, AND TO GET THE SOLUTIONS RIGHT TO COME OUT WITH YOUR\nSPECIFIC PLAN SHOULD NOT BE RUSHED.\nHE IS TAKING IN THE WISDOM OF MANY DIFFERENT COUNSELORS ON\nTHIS ISSUE, AND THAT INCLUDED SATURDAY'S MEETING, WHICH I\nATTENDED. >> RIGHT.\nHE'S GOT A NEW HISPANIC ADVISORY COUNCIL.\nBUT FORGET WHAT HE SAID OR DIDN'T SAY OR THE BUZZFEED\nREPORTING. THE QUESTION IS WHETHER IS HE\nSTILL GOING TO DEPORT THE 11 MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN\nTHIS COUNTRY? >> SO THIS IS WHAT HE HAS SAID.\nHE HAS SAID WHETHER IT'S HIS SPEECH LAST MONTH AT THE\nCONVENTION WHICH EVERYBODY CAN PULL AND READ OR WHAT HE SAID IN\nTHE PRIVATE MEETINGS THAT SOMEHOW GOT REPORTED, I THINK,\nAND DISTORTED BY THOSE WHO WEREN'T IN ATTENDANCE, IS\nBASICALLY THE SAME AND HE SAID IT TODAY IN OHIO.\nMEGYN, WHAT HE'S SAYING IS FIRST SECURE THE BORDERS AND ACTUALLY\nAPPLY AND ENFORCE THE LAW.  IMMIGRATION LAWS, A LOT OF IT\nSTARTS TO CHANGE. SECONDLY, YOU HAVE TO DEPORT\nTHOSE WHO HAVE COMMITTED CRIMES. THAT CERTAINLY IS NOWHERE\nNEAR -- >> BUT BEFORE -- BUT THAT IS ALL\nSORT OF GENERIC REPUBLICAN TALK. MANY REPUBLICANS HAVE SAID --\n>> MAYBE THEY DIDN'T MEAN IT. >> THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE\nWONDERING, WHETHER TRUMP MEANS IT.\n>> HE MEANS IT. >> IN THE PRIMARY SEASON, HE\nCAME OUT AND SAID HE WOULD FAVOR A DEPORTATION FORCE.\nHE WAS PRETTY EXPLICIT ABOUT THAT.\nNOW THE QUESTION IS, IS THERE DOUBT ABOUT THAT?\n>> I THINK A DEPORTATION FORCE IS MORE THE LOGISTICS, IN OTHER\nWORDS, HOW DO YOU ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF MAKING SURE WE ARE FAIR\nTO EVERYONE? I THINK TOO MUCH OF THE\nCONVERSATION IS ALWAYS ABOUT WHAT'S FAIR TO THE ILLEGAL\nIMMIGRANTS? WHAT ABOUT WHAT'S FAIR TO THE\nAMERICAN WORKERS? >> SO THE 11 MILLION ARE GOING\nTO BE DEPORTED? >> HERE IS WHAT HE SAID ABOUT\nTHAT. HE WILL ENFORCE THE LAW, WHICH\nWILL TAKE CARE OF A LOT OF THAT. HE WILL DEPORT THOSE WHO HAVE\nABSOLUTELY COMMITTED A CRIME, BEING CONVICTED OF A CRIME.\nHE WILL MAKE SURE THAT AMERICAN JOBS ARE PROTECTED.\nHE WILL ABSOLUTELY BUILD THAT WALL.\n>> THAT PROVIDES WIGGLE ROOM THAT WASN'T THERE BEFORE.\nBEFORE -- >> WELL --\n>> LET'S JUST PLAY THE DEPORTATION FORCE SOUND BITE\nBECAUSE THIS IS WHAT HE SAID DURING THE PRIMARY SEASON.\n>> ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE A MASSIVE DEPORTATION FORCE?\n>> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A DEPORTTATION FORCE, AND YOU'RE\nGOING TO DO IT HUMANELY. THEY'RE GOING BACK WHERE THEY\nCAME. IF THEY CAME FROM A CERTAIN\nCOUNTRY, THEY'RE GOING TO BE BROUGHT BACK TO THAT COUNTRY.\nTHAT'S THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.\nTHEY CAN COME BACK, BUT THEY HAVE TO COME BACK LEGALLY.\n>> MR. TRUMP, YOU'VE CALLED FOR A DEPORTATION FORCE TO REMOVE\nTHE 11 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS FROM THE UNITED\nSTATES. >> -- COUNTRY OR WE DON'T HAVE A\nCOUNTRY. WE HAVE AT LEAST 11 MILLION\nPEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY THAT CAME IN ILLEGALLY.\nTHEY WILL GO OUT. >> SO HE WAS PRETTY -- THERE WAS\nNO NO WIGGLE ROOM. >> THEY'RE GOING.\n>> SO HE IS DEPORTING THEM? >> HE WANTS TO APPLY THE LAW,\nAND HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE -- I THINK THE MOST\nIMPORTANT THING OF WHAT HE HAS SAID AND STILL SAYS, AND I'M\nVERY HAPPY THAT YOU PLAYED THE ENTIRE CLIP THERE, IS THAT WE\nNEED TO DO IT HUMANELY. >> HE'S DEFINITELY SAID HUMANELY\nFROM THE BEGINNING. BUT THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT\nTODAY, AND EVEN TODAY YOU'RE NOT BEING EXPLICIT.\n>> WHEN IT COMES TO DONALD TRUMP, EVERYBODY ALWAYS STICKS\nON ONE WORD. I KNOW HILLARY CLINTON IS BORING\nTO COVER AND SHE LIES FOR A LIVING, BUT --\n>> SHE'S NOT A FAN. >> MOST OF AMERICA THINKS SHE\nLIES. I'M JUST ONE OF THEM.\nDEPORTATION FORCE, HE IS TALKING ABOUT MECHANISMS.\nEVEN SENATOR JEFF SESSIONS, WHO IS A VERY CLOSE ADVISOR ON THIS\nISSUE, HAS NEVER CALLED FOR A DEPORTATION FORCE.\n>> BUT DONALD TRUMP DID. THAT'S WHY IT'S NEWS.\n>> I THINK THE MEDIA ARE SO WORRIED THAT HE HAD A GOOD WEEK,\nTHE MAINSTREAM MEDIA.  HE DID NOT SAY THAT.\n>> I DON'T CARE. >> THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO I ALWAYS\nHEARSAY THE SAME THING IN PRIVATE AS PUBLIC, A SURE YOU.\n>> I HAVE TO ASK YOU THIS FINAL QUESTION.\nYOU WERE A TED CRUZ SUPPORTER DURING THE PRIMARIES, AND YOU\nCAME OUT AND SAID I DON'T LIKE THE PERSONAL INSULTS.\nI DON'T LIKE SOMEBODY WHO HURLS PERSONAL INSULTS AND THEFRN YOU\nCAME OUT AND SAID DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T DO THAT.\nNOW, YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE. >> I WAS SAYING IN THE CONTEXT\nOF HE DOESN'T DO IT WITHOUT BEING ATTACKED FIRST.\nPEOPLE FORGET THAT THIS MAN IS --\n>> DOES THAT EXCUSE IT? YESTERDAY HE CALLED MIKA\nBRZEZINSKI NEUROTIC, WHICH IS ANOTHER TERM FOR BASICALLY\nMENTALLY ILL. HE'S CALLED OTHER FEMALE NEWS\nPERSONALITIES CRAZY. THE MAN DOES HURL PERSONAL\nINSULTS. >> BUT NOT UNPROMPTED.\nI DON'T LIKE PERSONAL INSULTS, ONLY BECAUSE I'M A MOTHER OF\nFOUR YOUNG CHILDREN. I'D BE A HYPOCRITE IF I LIKED\nTHEM. I ACTUALLY THINK HE CAN WIN ON\nTHE ISSUES, ON THE SUBSTANCE. OUR BEST GAME AGAINST HILLARY\nCLINTON IS TO TAKE HER ON FOUR SQUARE ABOUT HER RECORD.\n>> HOW IS THAT WORKING SO FAR BECAUSE THAT STUFF ABOUT MIKA\nWAS TODAY? >> SO HE FELT LIKE HE WAS BEING\nATTACKED. >> MM-HMM.\n>> WE HAVE INTERNS MONITORING THE PROGRAMS, AND HE FELT LIKE\nIT WAS A -- >> WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MY\nFRIENDS OVER AT MSNBC, THAT SHOW HAS LIKE TWO VIEWERS.\nWHY DOES HE LET HIMSELF GET WORKED UP OVER -- SO SHE DOESN'T\nLIKE HIM. TOO BAD.\nWHO CARES? >> I'LL TELL YOU THIS, MEGYN.\nIF IT'S UP TO ME, HE'S IN A TENNIS MATCH WITH HILLARY\nCLINTON. HE'S LOBBING AND SHOOTING ACES\nAT HER ALL DAY LONG. WE DON'T PICK A FIGHT WITH THE\nREF. WE DON'T BOO THE CROWD BECAUSE\nWE'RE ABSOLUTELY BACK IN HILLARY CLINTON'S HEAD.\nHE'S OCCUPYING SERIOUS REAL ESTATE IN HER HEAD BECAUSE YOU\nSEE THE WAY THEY'RE REACTING. THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE THIS\nCAMPAIGN ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, AND A LOT OF THEIR FRIENDS IN THE\nMEDIA ARE TRYING TO MAKE THIS CAMPAIGN ABOUT DONALD TRUMP.\nBUT THERE ARE ACTUALLY TWO CANDIDATES IN THE RACE, AND WE\nSHOULD BE COVERING BOTH OF THEM. >> AND SHE IS UP NEXT.\nSO DONALD TRUMP HAS MOVED ON FROM THE PARADE OF BUILDINGS ON\nTHE UPPER WEST SIDE TO RENTING SPACE IN HILLARY'S HEAD.\nKELLYANNE, WHAT A PLEASURE. BIG FAN OF YOURS.\n>> THANK YOU FOR THE PLATFORM.",

WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?\n>> I THINK IT'S PROBABLY CHANGE IN TONE AGAIN, IN THE\nEND PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SEE TWO CHOICES ONE WHO BELIEVES\nIN OPEN BORDERS AND BASICALLY UNLIMITED\nIMMIGRATION AND SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES IN ENFORCING THE\nRULE OF LAW. I THINK AND I IMAGINE WHAT\nTHEY'RE DOING IS THEY ARE SAYING THE WORST OF THE\nWORST WE KNOW UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION HILLARY\nWORKED FOR THEY RELEASED THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF\nFELONS. THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF\nCRIMINALS HAVE BEEN RELEASED INTO OUR COUNTRY AND\nCOMMITTING MORE CRIMES. WE HAVE GOT TO GET THOSE\nPEOPLE OUT OF THE COUNTRY. THAT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME\nTIME. THAT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME\nWORK. WHERE THEY GO FROM THERE, WE\nWILL SEE. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON IS GOING TO GET VERY FAR BY SAYING OKAY, DONALD\nTRUMP SAT DOWN WITH SOME HISPANIC AMERICANS AND THEY\nARE TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER A PROCESS THAT SIMENTZ LIKE IT\nWILL WORK MORE EFFICIENTLY THAN THE PREVIOUS PROCESS.\nTHEY SAY HE NEEDS TO PIVOT.

MODERATES?\nWHAT IS IT? >> I THINK THAT ASSUMING HE\nSTAYS ON THIS PATH AND SOFTENS THIS DEPORTATION\nFORCE IDEA, IT'S AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT HIS BASE\nIS WITH HIM NO MATTER. WHAT UP UNTIL NOW HE SEEMS\nTO BE DOUBLING DOWN ON THIS BASE STRATEGY NOT REACHING\nOUT TO SUBURBAN WOMEN, MODERATE VOTERS.\nTHIS SUGGESTS HE DOES UNDERSTAND HE HAS TO REACH\nOUT TO VOTERS WHO FIND THE IDEA OF MASS DEPORTATION OF\n11 MILLION PEOPLE OFFPUTTING.\nIS HE SOFTENING THE TONE.

THIS WAS A CENTRAL PART OF\nTHE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY DEBATE.\nAND THE KIND OF IMMIGRATION POLICY THAT WE'RE HEARING\nFROM DONALD TRUMP NOW, THROUGH LOOKS AND MEDIA\nREPORTS SOUND LIKE SOMETHING TO THE LEFT OF WHAT TED CRUZ\nWAS SUPPORTING AND WHAT SCOTT WALKER.\n>> THERE WAS SCHEDULED IMMIGRATION POLICY SPEECH AT\nTHE END OF THIS WEEK. WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS\nOTHER LOGISTICS GOING ON ABOUT TRAVEL OR OTHER\nTHINGS. BUT IT HAS BEEN CANCELLED SO\nFAR.

THIS MORNING ON FOX NEWS, TRUMP\nINSISTED HIS IMMIGRATION POLICY IS NOT CHANGING.\n>> WE HAVE TO BE VERY FIRM. WE HAVE TO BE VERY, VERY STRONG\nWHEN PEOPLE COME IN ILLEGALLY. WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT\nWANT TO COME IN THROUGH THE LEGAL PROCESS.\nIT'S NOT FAIR FOR THEM.

AS THE WEEKS UNFOLD, HE WILL LAY\nOUT THE SPECIFICS OF THAT PLAN THAT HE WOULD IMPLEMENT AS\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. >> WILL THAT PLAN INCLUDE A\nDEPORTATION, THE KIND THAT YOU JUST HEARD IN THAT SOUND BITE\nAND THAT HE TALKED ABOUT DURING THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY?\n>> TO BE DETERMINED. >> T.B.D.\nDANA, HOW ABOUT THE MESSAGING THERE.\nYOU HAVE THE CANDIDATE, THE NOMINEE, SAYING THAT IN FACT\nHE'S GOING TO NOT CHANGE THE POSITION ET CETERA, BUT THEN\nWE'VE GOT INFORMATION SAYING THAT HE WILL AND HIS CAMPAIGN\nMANAGER, A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT MESSAGE.\n>> WE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO GET MORE INFORMATION BECAUSE\nWHAT DANA BASH WAS ASKING KELLY AN CONWAY WAS IS HE GOING TO LAY\nTHIS OUT ON THURSDAY AT A SPEECH IN COLORADO WHERE HE'S GOING TO\nBE SPEAKING AND SHE SAYS TO BE DETERMINED.\nTHEN WE FIND OUT TODAY HE'S NO LONGER GOING TO BE GIVING A\nSPEECH ON IMMIGRATION. HE'S JUST GOING TO DO A\nFUNDRAISING EVENT IN COLORADO WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT STATE FOR\nHIM TO TRY TO WIN. SO I THINK -- I DON'T KNOW.\nWHEN I LISTEN TO HIM ON \"FOX & FRIENDS,\" I FEEL LIKE HE STILL\nLEFT THE DOOR OPEN FOR CHANGES, BUT THEN HE DOESN'T WANT PEOPLE\nTHAT SUPPORTED HIM FOR HIS EARLIER STANCE ABOUT DEPORTING\nPOSSIBLY UP TO 11 TO 12 MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WHO HAVE BEEN\nIN THE COUNTRY FOR A PERIOD OF TIME WHO CAME HERE ILLEGALLY BUT\nHAVE BEEN HERE FOR A WHILE SO-CALLED IN THE SHADOWS, I\nDON'T KNOW WHAT HIS POSITION IS. >> ERIC, HOW DO YOU RECONCILE IT\nAND HE'S SAYING I WANT TO BE FAIR TO THE PEOPLE WHO STAND IN\nLINE AND WAIT AND FOLLOW THE LAW AND COMPLY WITH THE LEGAL\nREQUIREMENTS FOR CITIZENSHIP IN THIS COUNTRY?\n>> LOOK, I DON'T KNOW HOW HE DOES IT.\nRIGHT NOW THE TWO THINGS HE HAS TO DO IF HE BECOMES PRESIDENT,\nHE HAS TO BUILD A WALL, HE CAN'T BACK OFF ON THAT, AND HE HAS TO\nGET MEXICO TO PAY FOR IT. THOSE ARE TWO THINGS HE CAN'T --\nTHERE'S NO WIGGLE ROOM IN THOSE. AS FAR AS THE DEPORTATION, HE\nSAID IT WITH MORNING JOE AND MIKA A FEW MONTHS AGO, SEVERAL\nMONTHS AGO, I DON'T KNOW IF HE CAN TURN ON IT.\nMAYBE HE CAN, I'M NOT SURE. MAYBE HE CAN SAY I'VE BEEN\nADVISED BY KELLY ANN CONWAY AND SOME OF THE OTHER ADVISERS THAT\nTHIS IS THE WAY WE NEED TO SOFTEN IT BUT HE MAY RISK HIS\nBASE BECAUSE HIS BASE LOVES THE IDEA OF DEPORTING ALL 12 MILLION\nPEOPLE WHO ARE HERE ILLEGALLY. I'M NOT SURE HOW YOU DO THAT\nPOLITICALLY. I WILL TELL YOU THOUGH, IT\nSHOULDN'T OVERSHADOW WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEK.\nLAST WEEK HE HAD AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN OUTREACH THAT\nWAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST PIVOTS I'VE EVER SEEN IN\nPOLITICS WHERE HE'S HAVING A HARD TIME WITH\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS, NO DOUBT, AND HE GOES TO MICHIGAN, AND HE\nMAKES THIS SPEECH SAYING WHAT THE HELL -- WHY NOT GIVE ME A\nTRY, WHAT COULD POSSIBLY -- >> WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE.\n>> WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE.

HE HAS A CHANCE TO MAKE CHANGES\nAND PIVOT TOWARDS MORE DIVERSITY.\n>> GREG, YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE WHEN YOU POINTED OUT\nTHAT THERE ARE DEMOCRATS IN CHARGE OF SO MANY OF THESE\nFAILING CITIES WITH LIBERAL POLICIES WHICH HAVE NOT PRODUCE\nECONOMIC GROWTH WHEN YOU LOOK AT DETROIT AND CHICAGO, ET\nCETERA -- >> CLEVELAND, ALL THOSE.\n>> YOU'RE PIVOTING AWAY FROM THE STORY.\n>> THAT'S FUNNY, GREG. >> ANSWER ALL OF IT.\n>> NO, NO, I'M NOT ANSWERING ANY OF IT.\nI'M GOING TO STICK TO WHAT KELLY ANN CONWAY SAID WHICH WAS SHE\nGAVE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN A NEW SLOGAN, TO BE DETERMINED.\nTHAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS CAMPAIGN IS, TO BE DETERMINED,\nAND THAT IS NOT A CRITICISM BY THE WAY.\nBECAUSE HE GLIDES FROM EVENT TO EVENT WITH IMPULSIVE OPINIONS,\nEVERY PROMISE THAT HE MAKES IS ACTUALLY A NEGOTIATION POSITION.\nHE SAYS THIS THING AND THEN HE GOES, MAYBE I'LL CHANGE MY MIND.\nIF YOU ACTUALLY BELIEVED THAT HE WAS GOING TO DEPORT 11 MILLION\nPEOPLE, THAT'S ON YOU. YOU PROBABLY BELIEVE THAT WAS\nRYAN LOCHTE'S ORIGINAL HAIR. THE FACT IS THERE WAS NO\nPOSSIBLE WAY HE WAS EVER GOING TO DO IT.\nHE WAS FEEDING HIS HUNGRY BASE WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN HIS\nPROBLEM. HE SHOULD HAVE STOPPED FEEDING\nTHEM AND STARTED AN OUTREACH TO THE HISPANICS.\nBY THE WAY, I'M GLAD HE MET WITH A GROUP OF HISPANICS.\nI HEAR IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES HE DIDN'T ASK THEM TO MOW\nHIS LAWN, SO THAT WAS GOOD. >> I WANT TO SAY THIS, SOMETHING\nI THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT HERE. I APPLAUD YOUR POINT, GREG, I\nAPPLAUD THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN FOR TAKING A STEP BACK AND TRYING TO\nFIGURE OUT SOMETHING THAT'S IN THEIR WORDS FAIR BUT FIRM.\nWHAT'S NOT OKAY IS HOW WE EVALUATE THAT.\nTRUMP DOESN'T GET TO SAY NOW I WANT TO TAKE SOMETHING THAT\nCONSIDERS A POSSIBLE WAY FOR SOME OF THESE IMMIGRANTS TO GET\nINTO AMERICA AND THAT BE CONSIDERED FIRM AND FAIR AND THE\nOTHER SIDE TO SAY THAT'S AMNESTY.\nTHAT'S AMNESTY LIGHT. STOP DEMONIZING WHEN PEOPLE WANT\nTO TAKE A STEP BACK AND LOOK AT IT FROM A REASONABLE STANDPOINT.\n>> RIGHT NOW HE HAS MORE POSITIONS THAN THE KARMA SUE TRA\nON IMMIGRATION AND IT'S OKAY.

MEANWHILE WHAT ABOUT THE\nTHOUSANDS OF AMERICANS WHO SUFFERED UNDER THIS LAW IN THESE\nCITIES. SO PEOPLE ARE LOOKING SOMETHING\nTO BE DONE ABOUT THAT. >> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS,\nFAIR BUT FIRM? THAT'S WHAT DONALD TRUMP NOW\nSAYS. WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING?\n>> IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE AS HE PUTS MORE DETAILS AROUND\nTHIS BECAUSE YOU HAVE CASES LIKE KATE STINLEY WHERE YOU HAVE\nFOLKS THAT ARE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AND HAVE COMMITTED\nOTHER CRIMES SINCE BEING HERE IN THE COUNTRY AND HAVE BEEN\nDEPORTED MANY TIMES AND THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE FRUSTRATED\nWITH THIS AND WANTS CHANGE AND DONALD TRUMP SEEMED LIKE THE\nKIND OF PERSON THAT MIGHT MAKE THOSE CHANGES.\nWHEN IT COMES TO THE STATUS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE ILLEGALLY\nBUT PERHAPS HAVE NOT COMMITTED OTHER CRIMES THE CONSENSUS IS IT\nWOULD BE HARD TO DO THIS MASS  DONALD TRUMP IS TRYING TO FIGURE\nOUT HOW DO I DO A GENERAL ELECTION STRATEGY WHERE I REACH\nOUT BEYOND MY BASE OF VOTERS AND BRING FOLKS IN WHO MIGHT BE\nQUESTIONING WHETHER OR NOT IT'S POSSIBLE TO TAKE THE VERY HARD\nLINE STANCE THAT HE RHETORICALLY HAS PUT FORWARD IN THE CAMPAIGN.\n>> HE SAYS FAIR BUT FIRM, BUT WHAT ABOUT THOSE WHO CAME HERE\nTHE RIGHT WAY, INCLUDING YOU YOURSELF, PEOPLE WHO DID THE\nRIGHT WAY TO COME TO AMERICA LEGALLY.\nI SAY WE DO SOMETHING WITH THE INCENTIVES.\nPENALIZE COMPANIES THAT HIGHER ILLEGALS AND MAKE SURE THERE'S A\nVERIFY PROGRAM THAT WORKS. WE ARE A COUNTRY OF RULES AND\nLAWS AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE NEED TO RECOGNIZE.\n>> YOU DO THAT HE'S BACKED AWAY FROM THAT FIRM\nSTANCE, ROUND THEM UP, ALL OF THEM, TAKE THEM OUT OF THE\nCOUNTRY, HE HAS BACKED AWAY FROM THAT HASN'T HE.\n>> WE'RE WAITING TO HEAR THE CLARIFICATION ON THAT.\nAGAIN, HE SAID FAIR BUT FIRM AND PEOPLE DO WANT TO KNOW WHAT HE'S\nGOING DO. >> CHRISTEN YOU WELCOME FAIR BUT\nFIRM. >> I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT\nAPPROACH BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO THINGS LIKE E-VERIFY AND\nSECURING THE BOARDER THERE IS A CONSENSUS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE\nOF THOSE THINGS. THE QUESTION GETS THORNIER WHEN\nYOU TALK ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ALREADY HERE.\nI DON'T KNOW TO WHAT EXTENT CHANGING HIS TONE WILL EFFECT\nHIS ELECTORAL POSITION. HE DID WELL AMONG PRIMARY VOTERS\nTHAT DO WANT TO SEE A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP.\nIT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT POLICIES HE PUTS UNDER FAIR\nBUT FIRM. >> YES.\nTHANK YOU FOR JOINING US.",

WE'LL REPORT, YOU DECIDE.\nTHAT'S WHAT HE TOLD FOX NEWS THIS MORNING FOLLOWING REPORTS\nHE MIGHT SOFTEN HIS STANCE ON PLANS TO DEPORT MILLIONS OF\nGRANLTS. HERE ARE A FEW EXAMPLES OF WHAT\nDONALD TRUMP HIMSELF HAS SAID DURING THE CAMPAIGN.\n>> WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A DEPORTATION FORCE.\nIF THEY HAVE DONE WELL, THEY'RE GOING OUT AND THEY ARE COMING\nBACK IN ILLEGALLY. >> YOU'RE ROUNDING THEM ALL UP.\n>> WE'RE ROUNDING THEM UP IN A VERY HUMANE WAY AND A VERY NICE\nWAY. AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE HAPPY\nBECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE LEGALIZED.\nAND BY THE WAY, I KNOW IT DOESN'T SOUND NICE, BUT NOT\nEVERYTHING IS NICE. >> WE NEED TO HAVE A COUNTRY OR\nWE DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY. WE HAVE AT LEAST 11 MILLION\nPEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY THAT CAME IN ILLEGALLY.\nTHEY WILL GO OUT, THEY WILL COME BACK, SOME WILL COME BACK, THE\nBEST THROUGH A PROCESS, THEY HAVE TO COME BACK LEGALLY.\nTHEY HAVE TO COME BACK THROUGH A PROCESS AND IT MAY NOT BE HAVE A\nVERY QUICK PROCESS, BUT I THINK THAT'S VERY FINE AND VERY CLEAR.\n>> VERY FINE AND VERY CLEAR. HE'S BEEN EXTREMELY CLEAR THERE\nWILL BE A DEPORTATION FORCE. HE SAID IT, THE REPUBLICAN ON\nSATURDAY THEN SAT DOWN WITH HIS NEW HISPANIC ADVISORY COUNCIL AT\nTRUMP TOWER HERE IN MANHATTAN, AND AFTER THAT MEETING THE\nSPANISH LANGUAGE TELEVISION STATION UNIVISION CLAIMED HE\nWOULD LEGALIZE SOME UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS AND NOT DEPORT THEM.\nA PHRASE HE USED, NO ONE'S PROMPTED HIM FOR THAT.\nTHEN DONALD TRUMP'S NEW CAMPAIGN MANAGER KELLYANNE CONWAY TOLD\nCNN'S DANA BASH YESTERDAY THAT WHAT THE BILLIONAIRE SAID IN THE\nMEETING DIFFERED LITTLE FROM WHAT HE ALREADY SAID PUBLICLY.\n>> WELL, WILL THAT PLAN INCLUDE THE DEPORTATION FACE, THE WHAT\nYOU JUST HEARD ABOUT AND WHAT WILL BE IN THE REPUBLICAN\nPRIMARIES. >> TO BE DETERMINED.\n>> TO BE DETERMINED. BUT DONALD TRUMP SAID IT ON\n\"MORNING JOE.\" EVERYTHING IS NOT NICE, HE SAID,\nBUT IT HAS TO BE DONE. MILLIONS AND MILLIONS WILL BE\nDEPORTED. THEN THERE WILL BE A LEGALIZED\nPROCESS FOR SOME OF THEM TO COME BACK, THE GOOD ONES, AS HE PUT\nIT. HE ONCE SAID THAT ALL MUSLIMS,\nTHERE WOULD BE A COMPLETE AND TOTAL BAN ON ALL MUSLIMS.\nHE CHANGED THAT. AND SAID THERE WOULD BE\nDEPORTATION FORCES FOR THOSE IN THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY.\nHE SAID IT. THIS MORNING TRUMP CALLED INTO\n\"FOX & FRIENDS.\" AND HERE'S WHAT TRUMP SAID WHEN\nSTEVE DOOCY ASKED IF HE WAS OPEN TO LEAVING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN\nTHE COUNTRY. >> WE HAVE TO BE VERY FIRM.\nWE HAVE TO BE VERY STRONG WHEN PEOPLE COME IN ILLEGALLY.\nWE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WANT TO COME IN THROUGH THE\nLEGAL PROCESS. IT'S NOT FAIR FOR THEM.\nAND WE'RE WORKING WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY\nTO TRY AND COME UP WITH AN ANSWER.\n>> SO YOU'RE NOT FLIP-FLOPPING. >> NO, I'M NOT FLIP-FLOPPING.\nWE WANT TO COME UP WITH A REALLY FAIR BUT FIRM ANSWER.\n>> FAIR BUT FIRM. WELL, IT'S NOT ALWAYS NICE, HE\nSAID. DEPORTATION FORCE WOULD BE\nNECESSARY. ALL ILLEGALS WOULD HAVE TO BE\nROUNDED UP AND LEFT THE COUNTRY. WE KNOW BECAUSE WE HEARD HIM SAY\nIT. AND THEN HE SAID SOME WOULD COME\nBACK IN THROUGH A LEGAL PROCESS. IT WAS THE FOUNDATION OF THE\nBEGINNING OF HIS CAMPAIGN. REMEMBER, IT WAS DONALD TRUMP\nWHO SAID DOZENS OF TIMES, DOZENS AND DOZENS OF TIMES THAT\nIMMIGRATION ISSUE IS AN ISSUE BECAUSE HE MADE IT AN ISSUE.\nAND IT STUCK WITH A LOT OF YOU. A LOT OF VIEWERS AND A LOT OF\nVOTERS, A DEPORTATION FORCE TO RID THE COUNTRY OF ALL THE\nILLEGALS. BUT HE'S NOT FLIP-FLOPPING NOW.\nWE NEED A FAIR PROCESS. SO WHAT IS HE DOING?\nWELL, THIS ALL COMES AS THE STATISTICS GURU NATE SILVERS\nWEBSITE REPORTS THAT THE NATIONAL POLLS SHOW THE RACE\nTIGHT ANYTHING, BUT DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN GAINING IN STATE POLLS.\nAND IT'S THE INDIVIDUAL STATE VOTES THAT MATTER IN THIS\nPROCESS. MEANTIME, DONALD TRUMP IS\nBLASTING HILLARY CLINTON FOR HER DONATIONS TO THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION. DONALD TRUMP NOW SAYS THE\nFOUNDATION MUST BE SHUT DOWN IMMEDIATELY, AND THAT'S A QUOTE.\nHE RELEASED A STATEMENT THAT READS IN PART, THE CLINTONS HAVE\nSPENT DECADES AS INSIDERS LINING THEIR OWN POCKETS AND TAKING\nCARE OF DONORS INSTEAD OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\nIT IS NOW CLEAR THAT CLINTON FOUNDATION IS THE MOST CORRUPT\nENTERPRISE IN POLITICAL HISTORY. WHAT THEY WERE DOING DURING\nCROOKED HILLARY'S TIME AS SECRETARY OF STATE WAS WRONG\nTHEN AND IT IS WRONG NOW. THE RESPONSE FROM BILL CLINTON,\nAS THERE IS ONE, IN A MOMENT. MICHAEL IS REPORTING FROM\nBEVERLY HILLS, CALIFORNIA. FIRST KARL CAMERON WHERE DONALD\nTRUMP WILL BE HOLDING A REALLILY TONIGHT.\nWHERE DOES DONALD TRUMP STAND WITH THE NON-FLIP-FLOP,\nNON-DEPORTATION, FAIR IMMIGRATION THING?\n>> WELL, IT'S STILL IN FLUX. THEY SAY THEY ARE TRYING TO FIND\nA REAL FIRM ANSWER, BUT THERE WAS ONE MOMENT LAST YEAR WHERE\nTRUMP REALLY MADE IT VERY CLEAR HOW THESE GOALS, THESE\nASPIRATION THAT IS HE HAS SET, WHAT HE SAID WOULD BE HIS\nPRIORITIES, WHAT HE PROMISED AND PLEDGED HE WOULD DO.\nHE ALSO SUGGESTED WHEN IT CAME TO BUILDING A WALL AND HAVE\nMEXICO PAY FOR IT. HE ONCE SAID THAT, WELL, THESE\nARE ALL NEGOTIATING POSITIONS AND POINTED OUT THERE ARE\nMOUNTAINS OF NATURAL OBSTRUCTIONS IN THE WAY AND HE\nDIDN'T HAVE TO DO A WALL ALL THE WAY FROM THE PACIFIC TO THE\nGULF. IT COULD BE BROKEN UP IN PARTS\nWHICH CONTRADICTED TO HIM BUILDING A WALL TO HAVE MEXICO\nPAY FOR IT COAST TO COAST. TRUMP HAS DESCRIBED ALL HIS\nIDEAS, ALL HIS PRONOUNCEMENTS AS NEGOTIATING POSITIONS.\nWHICH IS TO SAY HE'S WILLING TO COMPROMISE.\nDURING THE REPUBLICAN WHY MARES HE SAID THAT.\nIT WAS A TIME WHEN REPUBLICAN VOTERS FELT COMPROMISE WAS A\nDIRTY WORD AND YET TRUMP DID AND SORT OF DEFIED THE LOGIC OF THE\nREST OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S PROCESS.\nEVEN THOUGH HE SAID THESE WERE A NEGOTIATING PROCESSES, HE'S\nCONTINUING. NOT A FLIP-FLOP, HE SAYS, JUST\nEVOLVING. >> THERE'S A NEW POLL OUT THERE\nIN OHIO, TELL US ABOUT IT. >> Reporter: IT SHOWS HILLARY\nCLINTON UP BY FOUR POINTS IN THE BUCKEYE STATE.\nOHIO IS THE ONE STATE WHERE NO REPUBLICAN HAS EVER BECOME\nPRESIDENT WITHOUT WINNING. AND THIS IS A VERY, VERY\nIMPORTANT STATE FOR HIM. AND IT SHOWS THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON IS DOING OKAY. YOU MENTIONED NATE SILVER, THE\nSTATISTICIAN WHO SAID THE NATIONAL POLLS ARE TIGHTENING,\nTO SOME EXTENT THAT IS TRUE. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE RECENT\nAVERAGES OF THE NATIONAL POLLS, HE'S DOWN 5.5 POINTS.\nHISTORICALLY WHEN A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HAS BEEN DOWN THAT\nMUCH IN AUGUST, THEY HAVEN'T WON.\nSOME OF THE POLLS SHOW HE'S DOWN AS MUCH AS NINE POINTS.\nA FEW WITH DOUBLE DIGITS. THEY ALWAYS CLOSE IN THE LAST\nFEW DAYS OF THE RACE. AS FOR THE TIME, HE'S STILL\nDEALING WITH POLLS AND IN THE BATTLEGROUND STATES.\nIN ALL OF THE POLLS, SOMETIMES WITHIN THE MARGIN OF ERROR, HE'S\nTRAILING TO PUT HIM IN A SERIOUS, SERIOUS PROBLEM.\nTHAT'S WHY THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE IS DOING THE\nGRASSROOTS CAMPAIGN FOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN DIDN'T RAISE AS MUCH AS HILLARY CLINTON DID\nLAST MONTH. SO ALL THE METRICS SUGGEST THAT\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS A BIG PROBLEM.\nAND TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF HOW REPUBLICANS ARE FEARFUL OF\nIT, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SUPER PACS INCLUDING PASTORS AND\nFAITH-BASED GROUPS REPORTING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO GROUND\nGAME. AND EVEN A SUPER PAC, ONE TO\nSUPPORT THE REPUBLICANS HOP IS ANOTHER TREND MEMBER THERE.\n>> TEAM FOX COVERAGE CONTINUES WITH MICHAEL EMMANUEL COVERING\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IN BEVERLY HILLS, CALIFORNIA.\nHOW IS THE CAMPAIGN OF SECRETARY CLINTON RESPONDING TO THIS\nATTACK ON THE FOUNDATION, ON THE CLINTON FOUNDATION?\n>> Reporter: WELL, SHEP, ALL CLOSE TO HILLARY CLINTON AND HER\nCAMPAIGN TEAM ARE ASSURING CHANGES IN POLICIES AND\nPROCEDURES ARE COMING TO THE FOUNDATION.\nIF SHE'S ELECTED, WE WILL, QUOTE, IMMEDIATELY IMPLEMENT THE\nFOLLOWING CHANGES. THE FOUNDATION WILL ACCEPT\nCONTRIBUTIONS ONLY FROM U.S. CITIZENS, PERMANENT RESIDENTS\nAND U.S.-BASED INDEPENDENT FOUNDATIONS.\nTHE FORMER PRESIDENT ADDING I WILL STEP DOWN FROM THE BOARD\nAND WILL NO LONGER RAISE FUNDS FOR IT.\nA SHORT TIME AGO CLINTON RUNNING MATE TIM KAINE FIRED BACK AT\nDONALD TRUMP. >> AND I HAVE THIS TO SAY TO\nDONALD TRUMP. BECAUSE THESE TIES AFFECT YOUR\nNET WORTH. BEFORE YOU GO ABOUT ATTACKING A\nCHARITY, WHY DON'T YOU COME CLEAN ABOUT YOUR OWN\nBUSINESSINGS AND TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHO YOU ARE IN\nDEBT TO. >> SO THE RESPONSE FROM THE\nCLINTON SIDE OF THINGS IS IT'S A CHARITY, CHANGES ARE COMING AND\nTHEN A QUICK COUNTER-PUNCH AGAINST DONALD TRUMP.\n>> THIS FUND-RAISER TONIGHT, THERE ARE BIG DOLLARS THERE IS,\nMIKE. >> NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.\nHILLARY CLINTON WILL GET HELP FROM MAGIC HALL OF FAMER MAGIC\nJOHNSON. THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS PLANNING\nTO SPEND $80 MILLION ON TELEVISION ADS NOW THROUGH\nNOVEMBER. FUND-RAISING IS SERIOUS\nBUSINESS. >> MIKE EMMANUEL, THANK YOU.\nWE HAVE THE U.S. SENIOR WRITER AT \"\"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\"\"\nHERE. >> HE'S GOT A DILEMMA ON HIS\nHANDS. HE'S GOT TO FIGURE OUT OF HIS\nPANIC VOTE. HE'S TRYING TO FIND THAT LITTLE\nWIGGLE ROOM IN THE MIDDLE. BECAUSE IF THE ELECTION IS AS\nTIGHT AS IT LOOKS AS IT WILL WITH THE POLLS YOU WERE JUST\nTALKING ABOUT, HE'LL NEED THE VOTES ON THE OTHER SIDE.\nNOT JUST THE WHITE WORKING CLASS.\n>> LAST WEEK HE HAD THE TOWN HALL AND HAD THE SPEECH IN WHICH\nHE APPEARED TO BE REACHING OUTZ TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS BUT HE WAS\nIN A MOSTLY WHITE TOWN. THE SUGGESTION CONTINUES TO BE\nTHAT HE MAY HAVE BEEN REACHING OUT TO WHITE PEOPLE, HIS OWN\nBASE, AND SAYING, I'M NOT SUCH A RACIST.\nIT'S OKAY TO VOTE FOR ME ME. THAT OUTRAGE COULD BE FOR THE\nPEOPLE WHO FOUND THE RHETORIC TOO DISTASTEFUL.\nDOES THAT MAKE SENSE? >> THERE'S A CERTAIN LOGIC TO\nTHAT, SHEP. YOU CAN SORT OF IMAGINE THAT HE\nDOESN'T NECESSARILY BELIEVE HE HAS A STRONG CASE TO MAKE SO\nFAR. SO -- STRONG CASE TO MAKE IN\nTERMS OF THE LANGUAGE HE WAS MAKING IN TERMS OF THE APPEALS\nTO THE BLACK AMERICAN VOTERS. TAKE A CHANCE, WHY NOT?\nTHAT'S NOT A REALLY STRONG APPEAL.\n>> WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? >> WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE?\nTHAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A REAL STRONG APPEAL TO MAKE HIS CASE\nTO AMERICAN VOTERS. BUT I AM IN AN AMERICAN TENT AND\nI WOULD LIKE TO SOFTEN THE MATTERS ON THIS APPEAL.\n>> THERE ARE ALSO REPORTS ON THIS ALTERNATIVE EVENT WHERE HE\nMAY BE BUILDING AN AUDIENCE FOR THE EMPIRE.\nI WONDER WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ON THAT AND WHAT \"THE WALL\nSTREET JOURNAL\" IS REPORTING ON THAT MATTER.\n>> WELL, REPORTING ON THE BROAD CAMPAIGN IT SEEM THAT IS DONALD\nTRUMP HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON HIS EFFORTS TO WIN THE WHITE HOUSE.\nALL ALONG OUR REPORTING HAS SHOWN THAT HE'S NEVER REALLY PUT\nTHE DISTANCE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND HIS BUSINESS THAT PAST KENNEDYS\nHAVE DONE. SO THERE'S A BLURRING OF THE\nLINE OF WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS DOING AT THE CAMPAIGN EVENTS IN\nHIS OWN FACILITY OR FLYING WITH THE TRUMP BAN EARN ALL THESE\nTHINGS. SO IT IS HARD TO SEPARATE THE\nTRUMP BLEND FROM THE CAMPAIGN. GLENN HALL FROM THE WALL STREET\nJOURNAL, GOOD TO SEE YOU. COLIN POWELL IS ACCUSING HILLARY\nCLINTON'S CAMPAIGN OF TRYING TO BLAME HIM FOR HER E-MAIL\nCONTROVERSY. THAT'S AFTER SECRETARY CLINTON\nTOLD HER TO USE THE IF FINANCIAL  WE'LL HAVE MORE COMING UP FROM\nTHE FOX NEWS DESK HERE ON THIS MONDAY.",

YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE I MEAN?\nMEXICO IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL.\n>> IT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE FEW QUASI CONSISTENIES OF HIS\nCAMPAIGN FROM THE MOMENT HE DRIFTED DOWN THAT ELEVATOR,\nDONALD TRUMP REPEATEDLY VILIFIED IMMIGRANTS, AND SO MUCH THAT THE\nONES WHO WENT TO HIS RALLIES REPEAT THE PHRASE AND BUILD THE\nWALL AND FINISH HIS SENTENCES ABOUT WHO WILL PAY FOR IT.\nHE HAS BEEN UNCOMPROMIING IN ADVOCACY OF WHO WILL PAY FOR IT\nAND TO REMOVE 11 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS IN THE\nU.S. THERE SEEM TO BE A FEW SIGNS HIS\nPOSITIONS ARE STARTING TO SHIFT.

TRUMP'S BIG SPEECH PLANNED FOR\nTHIS THURSDAY IN THE FORMERLY BACKGROUND STATE NOW CALLED OFF.\nAND DOCUMENTING THE CONFUSION, HIS PIECE IS ENTITLED SOLING THE\nMYSTERY OF DONALD TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION POLICY.\nYOU'VE BEEN COVERING IMMIGRATION A WHILE AND TRUMP FOR A WHILE.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING ON HERE?\n>> IMMIGRATION IS INDEED ONE OF TRUMP'S SIGNATURE ISSUES.\nYOU PLAYED THE CLIP, BUILD THE WALL, BUILD THE WALL, MAKE\nMEXICO PAY FOR IT. TRUMP TALKED ABOUT BUILDING THE\nWALL A LOT BUT VAGUE AND FLEXIBLE WHAT TO DO WITH PEOPLE\nALREADY HERE. WHY DOES THIS MATTER?\nYOU PROBABLY HEARD THE MOST ABOUT THE WALL FOLLOWING HIS\nCAMPAIGN. IF YOU COVERED THE IMMIGRATION\nDEBATE IN 2013, BY FAR THE BIGGEST ISSUE WAS LEGAL STATUS\nOR PATH TO CITIZENSHIP OR NO LEGAL STATUS FOR UNDOCUMENTED\nIMMIGRANTS. IF YOU WENT TO DEMOCRATS AND\nSAID, WE'LL GIVE YOU A DEAL, WE'LL BUILD DONALD TRUMP'S WALL\nAND IN EXCHANGE WE'LL GIVE YOU A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP, THEY WOULD\nALMOST CERTAINLY TAKE IT. IN FACT, IT WAS PUT IN THERE\nJUST TO BRING IN REPUBLICAN VOTERS.\nTRUMP DOESN'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT.\n>> EXTREMELY MILITARIZED WEAPONRY TO BE DEPLOYED TO THE\nBORDER AS WELL. >> EXACTLY.\nTHEY WERE GOING TO DOUBLE THE BORDER PATROL AND ADD ANOTHER\n20,000 PEOPLE. THE BASIC FOR DEMOCRATS IS THE\nEQUIVALENT OF LAND FOR PEACE AS A BASIS OF THE ISRAELI PEACE\nTALKS, ENFORCEMENT AS THE BASED FOR ALL -- BASIS FOR ALL\nIMMIGRATION BIPARTISAN. IF IT'S JUST MONEY, JUST MONEY\nWE DON'T CARE, WE'LL TAKE THE REST AS PART OF THIS DEAL.\nTRUMP DOES NOT HAVE A STRONG WORKING KNOWLEDGE OF THESE KIND\nOF SUBTLETIES. HE KIND OF CANNONBALLED INTO THE\nDEBATE LATE, AS LATE AS 2013 AND 2012, HE SOUNDED LIKE HE MIGHT\nBE PRO IMMIGRATION REFORM AND ONLY RELATIVELY RECENT DURING\nHIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN WE STARTED HEARING THIS TALK OF\nMASS DEPORTATIONS AND DEPORTING ENTIRE FAMILIES.\nHE MET WITH A GROUP OF DREAMERS IN 2013 AND THEY CAME AWAY LIKE\nTHE HISPANIC REPUBLICANS WHO MET WITH TRUMP THIS WEEK CONVINCED\nHE'S ON THEIR SIDE. THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE HE HAS\nTHOUGHT ABOUT ALL THAT MUCH COMPARED TO A BORDER WALL.\n>> WHAT IS HILARIOUS TO ME, DARKLY COMICAL, I SUPPOSE, IS\nWATCHING HIM TRY TO SQUARE THE CIRCLE EVERYBODY WORKING IN THIS\nAREA, REPORTING ON IT, THINKING ABOUT IT, LEGISLAING ON IT HAS\nBEEN TRYING TO SQUARE FOR YEARS. ALL THESE PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN ON\nIT. I COVERED THE McCAIN FIGHT IN\n2006 AND '07 AND YOU IN 2013, ALL THIS STUFF IS TOUGH AND\nTHORNY AND DOESN'T HAVE EASY SOLUTIONS AND LIKE A COLLEGE KID\nWITH A SPEECH DEADLINE THURSDAY, WE WON'T WORK THIS OUT IN TIME.\n>> EXACTLY.

ONLY WHEN TOUCHED BY TRUMP AND\nALL THESE PEOPLE HAVE TO LEAVE THE MITT ROMNEY SELF-DEPORTATION\nPOSITION, THIS IS AN AREA PEOPLE CHOOSE THEIR WORDS VERY\nCAREFULLY.

DONALD TRUMP'S INITIAL SURGE IN\nTHE POLLS, IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES WAS BASED ON RACISM,\nBIGOTRY AND HATRED OF PRESIDENT OBAMA.\nWITH OVER 60% OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS BELIEVING DONALD\nTRUMP'S LIE THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA IS NOT A NATURAL BORN CITIZEN\nAND 66% BELIEVING THAT THE PRESIDENT OBAMA IS MUSLIM.\nTHE ONLY POLICY, THE ONLY POLICY POSITION THAT FUELLED THE START\nOF DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN WAS HIS TREATMENT OF THE SOUTHERN\nBORDER.

AND HE WOULD DEPORT ALL 11\nMILLION UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE HERE, DEPORT THOSE 11 MILLION\nPEOPLE TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT WALL.\nTHAT WAS THE TRUMP PLAN, UNTIL THIS WEEKEND WHEN DONALD TRUMP\nTOLD THE PEOPLE IN THAT MEETING, THAT HE WOULD NOT DEPORT 11\nMILLION PEOPLE.

THE EXISTING LAWS, THE FIRST\nTHING WE'RE GOING TO DO, IF AND WHEN I WIN, WE'RE GOING TO GET\nRID OF THE BAD ONES, WE HAVE A LOT OF BAD PEOPLE THAT HAVE TO\nGET OUT OF THIS COUNTRY, THEY'RE GOING TO BE OUT OF THIS COUNTRY\nSO FAST YOUR HEAD WILL SPIN. WE HAVE EXISTING LAWS THAT ALLOW\nYOU TO DO THAT. AS FAR AS EVERYBODY ELSE WE'RE\nGOING TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS. >> GO THROUGH THE PROCESS, IN\nOTHER WORDS DO EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW.\nDONALD TRUMP NOW HAS NO INTENTION OF HIRING DEPORTATION\nFORCE. HE HAS NO INTENTION OF DOING ANY\nMORE DEPORTATION CASES THAN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE\nAND TONIGHT, FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, DONALD TRUMP CREDITED THE\nOBAMA ADMINISTRATION WITH HAVING DEPORTED A LOT OF PEOPLE, WHICH\nIT HAS THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS DEPORTED MORE IMMIGRANTS\nTHAN ANY OTHER PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION.\nDONALD TRUMP ONCE PRAISED THE MASS DEPORTATIONS TO MEXICO\nCARRIED OUT DURING THE EISENHOWER ADMINISTRATION, BUT\nTONIGHT DONALD TRUMP CONDEMNED PRESIDENT EISENHOWER'S MASSIVE\nDEPORTATION. >> YOU WOULDN'T DO THAT?\n>> I NEVER SAID, I NEVER HEARD THE TERM.\nI'M NOT GOING TO PUT THEM IN A DETENTION CENTER.\n>> YOU CITED DWIGHT EISENHOWER. >> -- IT WAS IN 1952 WHO, BY THE\nWAY, DEPORTED TREMENDOUS NUMBERS.\n>> HE ROUNDED THEM UP. WHEN YOU CITED HIM AS AN EXAMPLE\nOF SOMEONE THAT -- >> NO, I SAID THAT IT'S --\n>> YEAH. >> I SAID THAT IT'S SOMETHING\nTHAT HAS BEEN DONE AT A VERY STRONG MANNER, I DON'T AGREE\nWITH THAT. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT DETENTION\nCENTERS. >> JOINING US NOW, THERESA, HE\nDOES NOT APPROVE OF WHAT DWIGHT EISENHOWER DID AS OF TONIGHT.\n>> RIGHT. AND THEN IF YOU SAW HIS IN OHIO,\nHE BASICALLY SAID, HERE FIRST POLITICAL ADD ON FRIDAY IS HOW\nHE'S DOING TO ADD IT UP. IT WAS VERY REMINISCENT OF\nSHARING ANGLE AD THAT RAN IN NEVADA AGAINST SENATOR REED THAT\nBROUGHT OUT THE LATINO COMMUNITY, AGAIN, SOLIDIFIED\nCALIFORNIA AS A BLUE STATE. DONALD TRUMP, I DON'T THINK\nREALIZE THAT LATINOS SPEAK ENGLISH THAT'S WHY HE KEEPS\nGOING BACK FORTH. WE SPEAK BOTH AND WE ARE KEENLY\nAWARE OF WHAT HIS AGENDA IS. THEY MAY NOT LIKE HILLARY\nCLINTON, THEY'RE LIKE, SHOOT, CAN I VOTE FOR THIS GUY.\n>> IS THIS THE FINAL TURN IN THE IMMIGRATION STORY WITH DONALD\nTRUMP? ON THE WALL, HE ONLY SAYS IT\nWHEN THE AUDIENCE YELLS IT TO HIM, THEN HE GOES OFF PROMPTER\nAND HE MENTIONS THE WALL. BUT HIS CAMPAIGN STAFF HAS TAKEN\nANY REFERENCE TO THE WALL OUT OF HIS SPEECHES.\nIT'S UP TO THE AUDIENCE TO CREATE IT.\nSO WHERE ARE WE WITH THE WALL, WHERE ARE WE WITH DEPORTATION\nAND IS WHERE WE ARE TONIGHT WITH TRUMP, WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE\nNEXT WEEK ON THESE SUBJECTS. >> HERE IS WHAT WE KNOW, WE KNOW\nTHEY'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE UNPREDICTABLE.\nWE KNOW HE LOVES SPEAKING, WE KNOW THE REASON HE LOVES\nSPEAKING SO HE CAN FEED OFF THE CROWD.\nTO YOUR POINT, LAWRENCE, THE CROWD WANTS TO HEAR BUILD THAT\nWALL, BUILD THAT WALL, BUILD THAT WALL.\nWE KNOW THE REALITY IS IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.\nWE KNOW HE DOESN'T REALLY SPEAK -- HE SPEAKS DECLARATIVELY BUT\nHE DOESN'T SPEAK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT WHAT THAT WALL MEANS AND\nHOW YOU'RE DOING TO BUILD THAT WALL.\nWE KNOW THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE. WHAT'S INTERESTING HERE KELLY\nANN CON WAY, VETERAN, I'VE KNOWN HER FOR MANY YEARS.\nSHE'S NOT A CAMPAIGN OPERATIVE IN A TRUE SENSE OF THE WORD.\nSHE'S NOT LIKE A CARL OR KEN MELVIN OR ROBBY, SO SHE'S\nPROBABLY LOOKING AT THIS THROUGH FOCUS GROUPS, AS SHE SHOULD.\nSHE'S PROBABLY LOOKING AT THIS FROM A POLLING STANDPOINT, BE\nSHE'S TRYING TO CHANGE THE MESSAGING, THE REALITY IS THE\nSUBSTANCE OF DONALD TRUMP IS STILL THE SAME.\nTHEY'RE TRYING TO PUT LIPSTICK WITH A PIG AND I THINK THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE, NOT JUST REPUBLICANS, BY THE WAY, BUT\nINDEPENDENTS ARE SAYING WE'RE NOT GOING TO BUY THIS -- OF\nWHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT, THAT'S KNOWN AS DONALD TRUMP.\nIT'S JUST NOT REAL. >> CORNELL THAT FOLLOWING HIS\nCAMPAIGN MANAGER'S ADVICE, HE IS TRYING TO REACH OUT AND TRY TO\nDO SOMETHING ABOUT HIS TERRIBLE SCORE WITH HISPANIC VOTERS AND\nBLACK VOTERS, BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT, HE'S AT LEAST FOR THE\nMOMENT REVERSING A MAJOR POLICY POSITION OF HIS THAT COULD LOSE\nHIM VOTES IN THE BASE. SO IS THERE A WAY FOR HIM TO\nINCREASE OUT REACH TO OTHER VOTERS WITHOUT GIVING UP SOME OF\nTHE VOTERS WHO GOT HIM STARTED? >> LAWRENCE, FIRST I WANT TO\nTHANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TONIGHT BECAUSE I WAS SITTING\nAROUND, I HAD, YOU KNOW, NOTHING ELSE TO DO, I WAS SITTING AROUND\nIN SQUALLER, UNEDUCATED, UNEMPLOYED, WHICH IS PART OF THE\nTRUMP PITCH TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS.\nI THINK IT'S ABOUT WATCHING MODERATE VOTERS.\nI MEAN, IF YOU LOOK AT THE AFRICAN-AMERICANS, IF YOU LOOK\nAT HIS PITCH TO HISPANIC VOTERS, YOU HAVE TO THINK THAT HISPANIC\nAND AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS ARE GOING TO FORGET WHAT HAS\nHAPPENED TO THE ENTIRE YEAR, HE'S BEEN BOMBASTIC ABOUT, YOU\nKNOW, SORT OF ANTIIMMIGRATION, YOU KNOW, SHOWING RACIST\nTENDENCIES, YOU KNOW, PUSHING XEN PHOBIA.\nYOU'LL HAVE TO SAY, I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED THE LAST\nYEAR AND TRUST HIM HE'S DOING TO DO A BETTER JOB THAN DEMOCRATS\nON REFORMING IMMIGRATION. I DON'T THINK THIS IS REALLY\nABOUT, YOU KNOW, WINNING OVER HISPANIC VOTERS.\nI THINK YOU HAVE A MIDDLE SUAVE OF AMERICAN VOTERS WHO ARE\nUNCOMFORTABLE SUPPORTING SOMEONE WHO IS A RACIST.\nTHIS IS ABOUT INOCULATING SOME OF THAT.\n>> LET'S LISTEN TO HIS NEW PITCH TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND LATINOS\nWHICH IS, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO LOSE?\nLET'S LISTEN TO THIS. >> CRIME, ALL OF THE PROBLEMS TO\nTHE AFRICAN-AMERICANS WHO ARE EMPLOYED, SO MANY, SO MANY\nPEOPLE. TO THE HISPANICS, TREMENDOUS\nPEOPLE, WHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE?\nGIVE ME A CHANCE. [ APPLAUSE ]\nI'LL STRAIGHTEN IT OUT. I'LL STRAIGHTEN IT OUT.\n>> WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? >> OUR SAFETY.\nI MEAN THAT SERIOUSLY. WE HAVE SO MANY INCIDENCES OF\nYOUNG KIDS CRYING WHEN DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO DEPORTED, MY\nCLASSMATE SAYS I'M GOING TO GET DEPORTED.\nTHERE ARE NINE-YEAR-OLD, SIX-YEAR-OLD AMERICAN KIDS.\nHE'S CALLING TURMOIL IS GETTING IN LATINO COMMUNITY, ASIAN\nCOMMUNITY, REALLY FRIGHTENED TO BE SECURE.\nSO THE IDEA THAT THIS MAN IS GOING TO BE OUR NEXT PRESIDENT,\nNOT ONLY CAN HE GET GUARANTEED INCREASED TURMOIL, BUT FOR SURE\nYOU CAN GUARANTEE INCREASED TURMOIL WORLDWIDE.\n>> MARSHALL OF THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN ISSUED A STATEMENT\nTONIGHT IN RESPONSE TO THIS SAYING, IT COULD NOT BE CLEARER\nHOW MUCH AFRICAN-AMERICANS HAVE TO LOSE ON DONALD TRUMP, HE'S\nDOUBLING DOWN THAT SET OUR COMMUNITY BACK AND FURTHER\nDIVIDE OUR COUNTRY. AGAIN, THIS IS NOT SURPRISING,\nTHIS IS A MAN WHO QUESTIONS THE CITIZENSHIP OF THE FIRST\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT, HAS A DISTURBING PATTERN OF COURTING\nWHITE SUPREMACYIST. ROBERT, THOSE ARE ALL THINGS\nTHAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WOULD NEED PEOPLE TO FORGET IN ORDER\nTO PICK UP SUPPORT IN THESE COMMUNITIES.\n>> I HAVE A QUESTION AND A STATEMENT.\nCAN WE ACTUALLY -- CAN ANYONE BELIEVE THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS\nCONVERSATION ABOUT A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE?\nI'LL BE LYING TO EVERYONE ON SIN -- CINCO DE MAYO.\nHE QUESTIONED OUR PRESIDENT'S BASICALLY HIS LEGITIMACY TO BE\nPRESIDENT AND ALSO HIS LEGITIMACY TO BE AN AMERICAN.\nI DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE ARE EVEN HAVING A SERIOUS\nCONVERSATION ABOUT SOMEONE THAT IS POLLING AT 0% WITH\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS. I HAVE NO IDEA WITH WHAT HE'S\nPOLLING WITH LATINOS. THIS IS SOMEONE WHO SAYS, OH,\nTHERE'S MY AFRICAN-AMERICAN OUT THERE, THERE HE IS.\nHE'S MY FRIEND. AND HE SAYS SO IT -- ALMOST -- I\nDON'T THINK HE'S BEING MEAN. I DON'T THINK THIS IS MALICIOUS\nHERE. THIS IS WHAT HE THINKS.\nAND THIS IS THE TRUE AUTHENTIC CANDIDATE THAT IS RUNNING FOR\nTHE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES AND WE REALLY HAVE TO ASK\nOURSELVES THE QUESTION, TAKE THE REPUBLICAN LABEL OFF.\nTAKE THE DEMOCRATIC LABEL OFF, IS THIS WHAT WE WANT IN THE\nWHITE HOUSE. IS THIS WHO WE WANT TO REPRESENT\nUS. IS THIS THE PERSON THAT'S GOING\nTO BRING US TOGETHER WHEN HE TWEETS ABOUT THESE TYPE OF\nINCIDENTS AND TALKS ABOUT LATINOS AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND\nWOMEN AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES.\nLET'S JUST HAVE THAT CONVERSATION.\n>> I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE FIRST THING CORNELL SAID WHICH\nIS ABOUT THE STATE OF LIFE IN AMERICAN FOR BLACK PEOPLE TODAY.\nLET'S LISTEN TO DONALD TRUMP'S DEPICTION OF THAT.\n>> IT IS A DISASTER THAT AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE LIVING IN\nMANY CASES AND IN MANY CASES SOME OF THE LATINOS ARE FEELING.\nWHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? RIGHT NOW YOU WALK DOWN THE\nSTREET, YOU GET SHOT. >> YOUR REPLY TO MR. TRUMP.\n>> IT'S SUCH A DISCONNECT. IT'S SUCH A TREMENDOUS\nDISCONNECT FROM THE REALITIES OF WHAT BLACK AND BROWN LIFE IS.\nIT'S FEEDING INTO THE MOST SERIOUS STEREO TYPES THAT GIVES\nCOMFORT TO HIS BASE. I MEAN, LOOK, MOST BLACK PEOPLE\nAREN'T GANG BANGERS, MOST BLACK PEOPLE AREN'T UNEMPLOYED YOU\nKNOW WHAT WE DON'T NEED, WE DON'T NEED SOMEONE LIKE DONALD\nTRUMP TO COME SAVE US. WE'RE DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB\nSTROOIING.",

LIONS GATE FOR EXAMPLE --\n>> HOW MUCH OF THIS -- I KNOW YOU, BRIAN, WATCH A LOT OF TV.\nYOU DOWNLOAD STUFF AND WATCH IT. >> WELL, I'M ON A PLANE HALF THE\nDAY. >> YEAH, BUT YOU WATCH STUFF ON\nNETFLIX AT HOME. >> EXACTLY.\nBLOODLINES. >> HOW MUCH OF IT IS THAT PEOPLE\nAREN'T MOTIVATED TO GET UP OFF THE COUCH AND SPEND $25 OR\nWHATEVER IT IS TO TAKE A DATE OR A FAMILY TO THE MOVIES BECAUSE\nTHERE'S SO MUCH GOOD STUFF ON NETFLIX?\n>> WELL, WHEN IT COMES TO DOLLARS AND CENTS, THEE YAT RI\nKAL HAVE BEEN FLAT, BUT WE'RE SEEING RECORD YEAR AT BOX\nOFFICE. WHY?\nTHE THEATERICAL GOING THROUGH THE AIRLINE OR SPORTS STADIUMS\nWENT THROUGH 10, 15 YEARS AGO, DIVERSIFYING THAT PRICE POINT.\nIF YOU GO ON AIRPLANE YOU CHOOSE HOW MUCH YOU WANT TO PAY FOR\nWHAT TYPE OF SEAT. SAME THING HAPPENING IN THE\nMOVIE THEATERS NOW. IF YOU WANT PREMIUM SEATING,\nCINEMA DINING, THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS TO ENJOY A MOVIE.\nTHE INDUSTRY HAS DONE A VERY GOOD JOB IN FINDING A WAY TO\nOFFER A MOVIE GOING EXPERIENCE. >> WELL, THAT'S THE THEATER\nINDUSTRY. THAT'S NOT THE PRODUCERS.\nTHAT'S NOT THE. >> EVEN THE BIG NAMES AREN'T\nIMMUNE, RIGHT? JULIA.\nSCORCESE HAD A FLOP -- >> YES, EVEN THE BIGGEST NAMES\nCAN HAVE FLOPS. BUT I THINK THAT THERE IS\nSOMETHING TO THIS IDEA THAT THE THEATRICAL EXPERIENCE IS GETTING\nMORE DIVERSIFIED AND FANCIER, THE REASON WHY THE MOVIE THEATER\nCOMPANIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EARN MORE PER VISITOR THIS YEAR THAN\nTHEY HAVE IN THE PAST IS BECAUSE THEY'RE SELLING A HIGHER END\nCONCESSIONS, GETTING PEOPLE TO PAY MORE FOR FANCIER SEATS.\nI THINK PEOPLE DO LIKE TO GO TO THE MOVIES.\nTHE REASON WHY THE OVERALL BOX OFFICE IS UP THIS YEAR FROM LAST\nYEAR IS BECAUSE PEOPLE DO LIKE TO HAVE AN OCCASION TO GET OUT\nOF THE HOUSE AND HAVE A TRIP TO THE MOVIES AND HAVE THAT\nCOMMUNAL EXPERIENCE. BUT IT REALLY HAS TO BE WORTH\nIT. EITHER WITH A GREAT EXPERIENCE\nMOVIE THEATER OR REALLY AWESOME MOVIE YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT\nWITH ALL YOUR FRIENDS. I JUST THINK THE BAR IS MUCH\nHIGHER. >> ALL RIGHT.\nTHANKS, DANIEL. THANKS FOR JOINING US.\nJULIA, WHILE WE HAVE YOU HERE, THE RIO OLYMPICS JUST FINISHING\nUP. TAKE US INSIDE THE NUMBERS,\nRATINGS, STREAMING, PROFITS FOR OUR PARENT COMPANY NBC\nUNIVERSAL. >> OKAY.\nWELL, IN TERMS OF THE VIEWERSHIP NUMBERS, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME\nTHERE'S BEEN LIVE STREAMING OF THIS MANY HOURS OF CONTENT.\nAND THERE'S A TOTAL OF 27.5 MILLION VIEWERS.\nNOW, THIS IS COMING IN AT SECOND PLACE.\nIT'S SECOND BEHIND LONDON, WHICH HAD 30.3 MILLION.\nTHIS TIME THERE WAS A LOT MORE STREAMED ONLINE.\nIN FACT, THE TOTAL STREAM WAS 3.3 BILLION MINUTES, BUT LIVE\nSTREAMING IS 2.71 BILLION MINUTES.\nTHAT'S THE MOST FOR ANY EVENT EVER.\nIF YOU WANT TO PUT THIS IN CONTEXT, ALL PRIOR OLYMPICS\nCOMBINED HAD 1.48 BILLION LIVE STREAM MINUTES.\nTHIS IS 2.7. SO JUST A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF\nSTREAMING ONLINE. NOW, THE THING THOUGH IS WE HAVE\nTO KEEP IN MIND THAT 27.5 MILLION VIEWERS, THAT INCLUDES\nALL THE LIVE STREAMING AND IT IS DOWN JUST BECAUSE FEWER PEOPLE\nWERE WATCHING THOUGH DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT THE MOST\nPROFITABLE FOR NBC UNIVERSAL. NBC UNIVERSAL SAID THIS IS GOING\nTO BE THE MOST PROFITABLE OLYMPICS.\nTHEY SOLD ABOUT $1.2 BILLION WORTH OF ADS BEFORE THE GAMES\nBEGAN. THEN IN THE FIRST WEEK OR SO\nAFTER THE GAMES STARTED THEY SOLD ANOTHER $30 MILLION IN\nADVERTISING. WE'RE EXPECTING TO GET SOME MORE\nAD NUMBERS OUT PRETTY SOON. BUT THEY SHOULDN'T BE TAKING\nHOME MORE THAN $120 MILLION IN PROFITS.\n>> I'M CONFUSED. EXPLAIN TO ME HOW THEY ARRIVE AT\nTHAT 27 MILLION VIEWERS. AND WHAT DOES THAT COUNT?\nIS THAT JUST THE TOTAL NUMBER OF VIEWERS WHO ARE WATCHING NBC\nNETWORK, OR WHAT? >> NO, SO THAT IS -- THAT IS\nBROADCAST CABLE. AND I BELIEVE THAT'S THE AVERAGE\nIN TERMS OF -- AVERAGE IT'S AN AVERAGE OF 27.5 MILLION VIEWERS\nFOR THE 15 COMPETITION NIGHTS. SO THAT'S THE AVERAGE VIEWERSHIP\nON ANY OF THOSE 15 NIGHTS. AND THAT INCLUDES BROADCAST,\nCABLE AND DIGITAL. AND OF COURSE THERE'S MORE\nAVAILABILITY OF THIS YEAR'S GAMES THAN EVER.\n>> OKAY. SO THAT'S THE AVERAGE DAILY OR\nNIGHTLY VIEWERSHIP ACROSS ALL OF THE PLATFORMS THAT NBC UNIVERSAL\nPROVIDED. >> EXACTLY.\nAND IT'S LESS THAN WHAT WE HAD IN LONDON.\n>> GOT IT.",

AT THIS POINT THE PRESIDENT IS\nCARING MORE ABOUT HIS GOLF VACATION THAN BEING THERE FOR\nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THAT'S OBVIOUS AND EVEN SO MUCH THAT\nPEOPLE LIKE \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" HAVE CALLED IT OUT BECAUSE HE\nJUST IS NOT DOING HIS JOB AND HE WOULD -- HE CARES ABOUT OPTICS\nWHEN HE'S UP FOR REELECTION. HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT OPTICS\nBECAUSE HE HAS SIX MONTHS LEFT. >> HILLARY IS UP FOR ELECTION.\nWHY DOESN'T SHE GO WITH THE PRESIDENT TOMORROW.\n>> SHE HAS SAID PLEASE DONATE TO THE RED CROSS AND THE BATON\nROUGE AREA FOUNDATION. I'M GOING TO GO WHEN IT'S NOT\nGOING TO DIVERT RESOURCES AWAY. YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK IS THE\nREAL PROBLEM HERE?

SOME BECAME CONVINCED THAT\nBRICK AND MORTAR STORES ARE DEAD, BUT\nTHIS PAST QUARTER PUT THE LIGHT OF THAT SUPPOSITION IN SO MANY\nDIFFERENT WAYS. AMAZON IS GREAT WITH $50 BILLION\nIN DOMESTIC SALES, THAT MEANS THERE'S STILL ENOUGH MARKET\nSHARE TO GO AROUND, SINCE AMERICA HAD $4.21 TRILLION.\nIT'S NOT THE BE ALL AND END ALL THAT SO MANY PEOPLE THINK IT IS.\nMORE IMPORTANT, THOUGH, THIS QUARTER CHANGED OUR PERCEPTIONS\nOF BRICKS AND MORTAR RETAILERS IN INDIVIDUAL CASES.\nBEFORE MANY OF THEM SEEMED LIKE ZOMBIES.\nNOW IT'S CLEAR THAT SOME OF THEM HAVE A STRONG PULSE.\nTHAT'S WHY WE NEED TO BURY THE WHOLE DEATH OF THE MALL\nNARRATIVE RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW, THIS MINUTE.\nBECAUSE SO MANY MALL-BASED STORES PUT UP GOOD NUMBERS WITH\nCOMMENTARY WHILE I WAS IN THE MONASTERY.\nTHIS WAS A GOOD RETAIL SESSION, WHEN IT WAS NEITHER A QUARTER\nMARKED BY A WEARY CONSUMER, HUH-UH, NOR A PROMOTIONRY.\nAMERICANS SHOP. THEY WERE JUST VERY PICKY ABOUT\nWHERE THEY SPENT THEIR MONEY. MORE INTERESTED IN FINDING THAN\nSHOPPING, AS JC PENNEY REMINDED US.\nFIRST, FASHION'S BACK, THE EXCITEMENT OF FASHION.\nWE SAW NORDSTROM'S ANNIVERSARY SALE AFTER SEVERAL TEPID YEARS.\nTHE NEEDLE MOVED AND THE COMPANY REPORTED BETTER THAN EXPECTED\nNUMBERS. WHO ELSE GOT FASHION REALLY\nRIGHT? HOW ABOUT URBAN OUTFITTERS? ONE\nOF MY FAVORITE CEO, RICHARD HAEN PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE.\nHE WENT ON TO SAY I SAW MORE FASHION EXCITEMENT IN THIS\nSPRING THAN I'D SEEN IN QUITE A FEW YEARS.\nTHAT, ALONG WITH BRAND MOMENTUM, WHICH THEY STRESSED MULTIPLE\nTIMES, BROUGHT TRAFFIC BACK, EVEN TO MALL-BASED STORES.\nAND URBAN OUTFITTERS, I WAS STUNNED BY THIS, THE LOWEST MARK\nDOWNS EVER, REMEMBER NON-PROMOTIONAL PRICING?\nINCREDIBLE. MAYBE IT'S BACK.\nTHAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I EXPECT LULULEMON TO REPORT GOOD\nNUMBERS IN SEPTEMBER. AND 13% OF THE COMPANY WAS\nPURCHASED. THE WHOLE ROUTINE IS FIRST CLASS\nAND THEY EXTENDED INTO MENS FASHION BY A MAN FORMERLY OF\nNIKE. I LOVE MY ABC PANTS THAT I GOT\nFROM LULU, EVEN AS IT WAS A TAD EMBARRASSING WHEN I ASKED MY\nDAUGHTER WHO GAVE THEM TO ME, WHAT ABC STANDS FOR.\nIT'S A FAMILY SHOW. I SUGGEST YOU GOOGLE IT.\nFOOTLOCKER'S NUMBERS WERE PRETTY STRONG.\nWHEN ASKED ABOUT WHETHER FOOTLOCKER'S HURT BY BIG BOX\nMALL CLOSURES, THE CEO SAID CLOSING OF THE ANCHOR STORES HAS\nBEEN GOING ON FOR A WHILE. WE BELIEVE THERE ARE ONLY A\nCOUPLE PLACES IN THE MALL THAT PEOPLE WILL LINE UP FOR\nPRODUCTS. ONE IS THE FOOTLOCKER STORE AND\nTHE OTHER IS THE APPLE STORE. JOHNSON MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE\nINTERNET HAS BROUGHT A WHOLE NEW CLASS OF EXCITED SHOPPERS.\nI LOVE THIS. THEY WILL TAKE A PICTURE OF THE\nSNEAKER ON THE FOOT AND TWEET IT OUT OR SEND IT TO THEIR GROUP OF\nFRIENDS AND THEN FOOTLOCKER'S THE BENEFICIARY.\nSELLERS HAVE BEEN SWARMING ALL OVER THAT I THINK MAY BE BROUGHT\nON BY THE LIQUIDATION OF SPORTS AUTHORITY.\nTHEY REPORTED EXCELLENT SALES FOR NIKE AND UNDERARMOUR, BUT\nIT'S GOT MOMENTUM FOR BACK TO SCHOOL.\nYOU HAVE TO BE IMPRESSED IN L BRANDS.\nWITH THE PINK DIVISION. IT HELPED FUEL A FABULOUS QUARTER.\nPINK'S ALL ABOUT FASHION TOO. JC PENNEY IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE\nOF THE MALL COME-BACK STORY. TON OF CASH GENERATION, NOT LIKE\nTHE PENNY OF OLD, BUT MUCH BETTER THAN THE OLD PENNEY.\nTHAT WAS THE PENNEY THAT WAS BEFORE IT WAS ALMOST DESTROYED\nBY TERRIBLE MANAGEMENT. IT IS PIVOTING BACK TO HOUSE\nBRANDS AND FURNISHINGS AND FURNITURE, PLUS-SIZED APPAREL\nAND SEPHORA. EVERYBODY'S TRYING TO CASH IN ON\nTHAT HOUSING MARKET. PEOPLE ARE INVESTING IN THEIR\nHOMES. SHE WANTS NEW CARPETS\nAPPLIANCES, TEXTILES. HOW WELL ARE THESE DOING?\nIT GOES ON TO SAY WE PILOTED APPLIANCES IN 22 STORES AND ARE\nBLOWN AWAY. APPLIANCES HAVE A SELLABLEBILITY\n10 TIMES HIGHER. PENNEYS WITH THE FALTERING\nSEARS. AND WE THINK THIS IS AN\nOPPORTUNITY TO CAPTURE MARKET FROM SEARS AS THEY CONTINUE TO\nDOWN SIZE THEIR FOOTPRINT. WE KNOW THAT AMAZON PRIME BUT T\nBRICK AND MORTAR CAN TRULY BENEFIT AS JC PENNEY POINTED\nOUT. BECAUSE THE OMNI CHANNEL SHOPPER\nSPENDS TWICE AS MUCH AT JC PENNEY AS THE PURE BRICK AND\nMORTAR SHOPPER. HOME DEPOT POINTED OUT.\nLOWE'S DIDN'T HAVE A STANDOUT QUARTER.\nSHOPPING FOR THE HOME'S JUST ON A DIFFERENT CYCLE THAN CLOTHES.\nBUT APPAREL INVENTORIES ARE DOING BETTER.\nSO I GOT AN IDEA. LOOK FOR PVH TO REPORT A\nSTRONGER QUARTER. IT COULD BE A BARNBURNER.\nTHE LAST QUARTER WAS GOOD, BUT THIS TIME THEY'VE GOT CALVIN\nKLEIN AND DENIM. AND THEY WERE SELLING WELL.\nAND THE CEO DECIDED TO GIVE ACROSS THE BOARD PAY RAISES FOR\nEMPLOYEES. IT'S COSTING THE COMPANY\nFORTUNES IN ENDLESS TRAINING. THERE'S BEEN BETTER SUPPLY\nCHAINS. WHO KNOWS WHAT JET.COM WILL IT YIELD.\nWHO DIDN'T GET IT? MACY'S AND TARGET WERE THE TWO\nMOST WORRISOME AND I THINK IN MANY WAYS OUT OF STEP THIS\nQUARTER. MACY'S IS CLOSING 100 STORES,\nBUT IT FITS THE PATTERN OF THE FLAILING COMPANY WITH NO REAL\nPURPOSE. ITS CLOSURES COULD BE A BOON FOR\nDAVE AND BUSTERS, WHICH IS LOOKING FOR BIG PARKING LOTS.\nHOW ABOUT TARGET? THIS IS A TOUGH ONE.\nWHAT CAN I SAY? AFTER COMING IN HOT, CEO BRIAN\nCORNELL IS NOW PUTTING UP THE MOST DISAPPOINTING SALES, SAVE\nSEARS. HE BLAMED SOME OF THE OUTLETS\nFOR THE WEAKNESS, HE DOCUMENTED, BUT CVS DIDN'T SQUAWK ABOUT IT.\nAND WHO GOES TO TARGET FOR APPLE?\nWHO? BECAUSE MANY OF THE APPLE'S\nNON-CELL PHONE TARGETS THAT TARGET SELLS PUT UP TERRIFIC\nNUMBERS AT OTHER STORES. TARGET SEEMS LOST IN MANY\nAISLES. AND THAT'S NOT A GOOD THING.\nLET'S STOP TALKING ABOUT THE DEATH OF THE MALL OR THE WANING\nDAYS OF BRICKS AND MORTAR AND TALK ABOUT THOSE WHO ARE\nFIGHTING BACK WITH MORE RETAILTAINMENT.\nTHE ONES WHO AREN'T PROMOTING THE AMERICAN CONSUMER, WHY?\nBECAUSE BUSINESS IS TOO STRONG TO KEEP ON LYING.\nLET'S GO TO ANNEMARIE IN NEW YORK.\n>> Caller: WELCOME BACK. >> WHAT'S UP?\n>> Caller: WILL YOU HELP ME WITH  I LISTENED TO A CONFERENCE CALL.\n>> THE STOCK HAS BEEN STUCK. THE QUARTER WAS JUST OKAY WITH A\nHIGH MULTIPLE STOCK. BUT OKAY WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH.\nI THINK THEY'RE SUPERIOR MERCHANTS.\nI WOULDN'T DUCK OUT. LET'S GO TO NICK IN ILLINOIS.\n>> Caller: I'M DOING WELL, HOW ABOUT YOU?\n>> I'M DOING GOOD. >> Caller: I WAS CALLING ABOUT\nSTARBUCKS. >> OUR CHARITABLE TRUST, WE ARE\nLOWERING OUR EXPECTATIONS A BIT WE THINK STARBUCKS IS HAVING AN\nOKAY TIME. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE GOING TO\nBOUNCE BACK AS MUCH AS I THOUGHT.\nWE LOWERED EXPECTATIONS WHICH MEANS I DON'T EXPECT IT TO TAKE\nOUT ITS OLD HIGH ANYTIME SOON. >> L BRANDS IS FIGHTING BACK\nAGAINST THE AMAZON DEATH STAR. MUCH MORE \"MAD MONEY\" AHEAD.\nFEEL LIKE YOUR PORTFOLIO COULD USE A LITTLE SPRUCING UP?\nDON'T MAKE A MOVE UNTIL YOU HEAR MY TAKE ON A NEW IPO AT HOME.\nTHEN, WONDER WHERE THE REAL M&A HOT SPOT IS?\nIT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH PFIZER'S BIG TAKEOVER.\nAND I'LL HAVE NAMES, AND NO CASE",

IN ADDITION TO THE RED HOTS,\nWE'VE ALSO SEEN SOME SCORNED IPOs THAT HAVE BEEN, WELL, NOT\nSO HOT? CONSIDERATE HOME, AND THE SYMBOL\nIS HOME, H-O-M-E. IT WENT PUBLIC TWO WEEKS AGO.\nIT'S DONE LITERALLY NOTHING SINCE THEN.\nTHIS STOCK MAY NOT HAVE THE SEX APPEAL OF A TWILIO, FEW DO.\nBUT I THINK THEY MAY BE UNDERESTIMATING IT.\nWE'RE GOING TO PLAY A LITTLE GAME TO GET OUR HEADS AROUND THE\nPOSITIVES AND THE NEGATIVES. LET'S START WITH POSITIVES.\nWE KNOW THAT HOUSING-RELATED RETAILERS HAVE BEEN SOME OF THE\nSTRONGEST PERFORMERS IN THE BRICKS AND MORTAR SPACE, THINK\nHOME DEPOT. TJX IS POPULAR.\nHOME GOODS. SELLING REASONABLY PRICED ITEMS\nWHICH CAN BE DELIVERED TO YOUR DOOR, NO ASSEMBLY REQUIRED!\nPLUS, THIS IS THE POTENTIAL TO BE A MAJOR REGIONAL TO NATIONAL\nGROWTH STORY WITH THE COMPANY EXPANDING TO MORE THAN 600\nSTORES BEFORE THEY SATURATE THE  AND THESE ARE TRUE SUPER STORES.\nWITH OVER 50,000 DIFFERENT PRODUCTS.\nEVEN BETTER, MORE THAN 70% OF THEIR MERCHANDISE IS EITHER\nUNBRANDED, PRIVATE LABEL OR DESIGNED BY AT HOME ITSELF.\nMEANING THEY MOSTLY SELL THEIR OWN PRODUCTS.\nTHEY CARRY HIGHER GROSS MARGINS. BEYOND THAT, AT HOME COMPETES AT\nA LARGE AND HIGHLY-FRAGMENTED INDUSTRY.\nTHE LARGEST PLAYERS HAVE TREMENDOUS MARKET SHARE, BUT THE\nTHREE LARGEST ACCOUNT FOR 25% OF THE BUSINESS.\nI NOW THINK IT'S EMINENTLY DO-ABLE.\nAT HOME HAS OPENED 53 NEW STORES, 32 ARE IN NEW MARKETS.\nMANAGEMENT PLANS TO OPEN 22 NEW STORES A YEAR.\nHOWEVER, IT'S NOT JUST ENOUGH TO EXPAND REALLY RAPIDLY UNLESS YOU\nHAVE A CONSENT THAT WORKS. AT HOME IS A ONE-STOP SHOP FOR\nYOUR HOME NEEDS. YOU CAN GET ALL YOUR FURNITURE\nSHOPPING DONE IN ONE TRIP, RATHER THAN TREKKING TO MULTIPLE\nSTORES TO FIND EVERYTHING YOU NEED.\nAND IT'S CLEAR IT'S WORKING. ALL OF AT HOME'S STORES THAT\nWERE OPEN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR ARE PROFITABLE.\nAND THOSE OPEN MORE THAN A YEAR HAVE PROFITS OF $6 MILLION.\nIT'S TERRIFIC. IT TELLS THE OLDER STORES ARE\nSTILL ATTRACTING PEOPLE. IF YOU WANT TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN RETAIL, YOU NEED TO OFFER AN\nENJOYABLE SHOPPING ENVIRONMENT. THEY HAVE SHOPPING WAREHOUSE\nTHAT COMBINE THE SCALE OF THE BIG BOX FORMAT WITH CLEAR\nSIGNAGE. AND AN INTERIOR RACETRACK, NOT\nLIKE GOING TO IKEA WHERE THERE'S BARELY ANY ORGANIZATION.\nBY THE TIME YOU GET TO CHECKOUT YOU AND YOUR SPOUSE ARE READY TO\nKILL EVEN OTHER. IT GIVES CUSTOMERS GOOD VALUE\nWITHOUT THE NEED FOR COSTLY PROMOTIONS.\nAND 80% OF ITS SALES OCCUR AT FULL PRICE.\nON TOP OF THAT, THESE GUYS KNOW HOW TO EXECUTE.\nAT HOME USES STRICT INVENTORY CONTROLS IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE\nMARK DOWNS AND THE PRIVATE LABEL STRATEGY MEANS THEY CAN BETTER\nCONTROL COST. DURING THE 2014 AND 2015 YEARS,\nAT HOME PLOWED $47.8 MILLION INTO REGRADING THE COMPANY, THEY\nALSO SPENT ANOTHER $37 MILLION UPDATING SYSTEMS AND BUILDING\nOUT CAPABILITIES TO SUPPORT THE NEXT GROWTH TRAJECTORY.\nSO IF THEY EXPAND FAST THEY'LL BE ABLE TO HANDLE IT.\nIN THE 2016 FISCAL YEAR, AT HOME POSTED 25% REVENUE GROWTH.\nTHESE NUMBERS HAVE DECELERATED SLIGHTLY, DOWN TO 21.9%, BUT\nIT'S STILL GOOD. THE EARNINGS ARE EXPLODING.\nAND THEY'VE BUILT A TON OF NEW LOCATIONS.\nAT HOME WENT FROM NOT QUITE BREAKING EVEN IN 2015, AND WE\nEXPECT MORE EXPLOSIVE GROWTH. THAT'S THE BULL CASE. LET'S\nTHROW IN SOME NEGATIVE. AT HOME DOES NOT HAVE A PRETTY\nBALANCE SHEET, GOT MORE THAN $300 MILLION IN DEBT, NOT MUCH\nCASH. THAT DOESN'T WORRY ME, BECAUSE\nTHEIR MAJOR DEBTS DON'T START COMING DUE FOR SIX YEARS, AND\nTHEY USE THE PROCEEDS OF THE IPO TO TURN DOWN A $130 MILLION TERM\nLOAN. WHAT ELSE?\nWE GOT JANET YELLEN SPEAKING OVER THE WEEKEND.\nIT MIGHT CAUSE A DOWN TICK ON HOME FURNISHINGS.\nAND LET'S JUST SAY, WE COULD GET INTO A TRADE WAR.\nI LIKE AT HOME. LET'S TALK STOCK.\nIT'S HARD TO GET A GOOD READ ON THEIR EARNINGS POWER, ESPECIALLY\nSINCE THE EARNINGS SEEM TO BE PRETTY LUMPY.\nTHANKS TO THE DOUBLE WHAMMY OF BACK TO SCHOOL AND THE HOLIDAYS,\nAT HOME ARE EARNING 14%, IF YOU'RE ANNUALIZING THAT, YOU'RE\nLOOKING AT 56 CENTS PER SHARE. TJX IS NEARLY 23 TIMES EARNINGS.\nIT'S MORE IN LINE WITH BURLINGTON STORES AT 28 TIMES\nEARNINGS. SO AT HOME'S NOT CHEAP.\nTHAT SAID, WITH AT HOME'S SPECTACULAR 20% PLUS REVENUE\nGROWTH, I CAN SEE MANAGERS PAYING THROUGH THE NOSE FOR THIS\nONE AS LONG AS IT CAN EXECUTE. IT'S JUST THAT NOBODY'S FOCUSSED\nON IT BUT \"MAD MONEY.\" YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND YOUR RISK\nTOLERANCE BEFORE YOU PULL THE TRIGGER.\nIF YOU'RE WILLING TO DO A LITTLE SPECULATION, YOU HAVE MY\nBLESSING TO BUY AT HOME WITH SOME OF YOUR DISCRETIONARY \"MAD\nMONEY.\" WE'RE BACK AFTER THE BREAK.",

SO HUGE DIFFERENCES.\nTHAT'S A COMPLETE REVERSAL. >> SO IS THIS TREND GOING TO BE\nRELIANT ON CONTINUED LOW INTEREST RATES?\n>> YEAH, AFFORDABILITY DEFINITELY PLAYS A ROLE.\nHOME PRICE APPRECIATION IS SUPER IMPORTANT.\nONE DIFFERENTIATOR BETWEEN THIS RECOVERY THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW\nVERSUS OTHERS FOR REMODELING IS WE'RE SEEING A LOT MORE HIGHER\nTICKET SPEND, TRADE UP IN PROJECTS, MAYBE FEWER REMODELS\nPER HOUSEHOLD BUT WORTH MORE AT THE END.\n>> YOU KNOW, BOB, WHEN YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO RUN OFF THE\nTRACKS, I THOUGHT YOU SAID RUN OFF THE TREX.\nYOU DIDN'T. >> WATCH YOURSELF.\n>> I'M LEARNING FROM YOU. >> WATCH YOURSELF.\n>> MY QUESTION WAS SO TODD JUST SAID HE SAW MAYBE 25% REVENUE\nINCREASE IN REMODELING  SMALLER NUMBER.\nIS THAT THE MORE PROFITABLE PART OF THEIR BUSINESS?\n>> THE PSYCHO INTO TODD'S COMMENT IS RIGHT, WE SEE A SHIFT\nUP WITH CONSUMERS FEELING BETTER ABOUT THE UNIVERSE.\nTHEY'RE NOT GOING FOR THAT ENTRY LEVEL PRODUCT.\nTHEY'RE GOING TO PAY MORE TO GET LUXURY IN THE HOUSEHOLD.\n>> WHAT IS THE BUSINESS MIX ON SOME OF THESE COMPANIES HERE?\nIN OTHER WORDS AT 26% GROWTH RATE ON A SMALLER PART OF THE\nBUSINESS MIGHT NOT BE AS MEANINGFUL AS A SMALLER INCREASE\nIN THE GROWTH RATE ON SOMETHING THAT IS THE MASSIVE PART.\n>> SO NUMBER ONE YOU ALWAYS WANT TO BE REPAIR AND REMODEL BECAUSE\nHOME BUILDERS ARE GOING TO DRIVE A TOUGH BARGAIN.\nNUMBER TWO, MAJORITY OF THE COMPANIES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT\nDRIVE 75% OF THEIR REVENUES FROM REPAIR AND REMODEL.\nSO THEY'RE IN THE SWEET SPOT OF HIGH PROFITABILITY AND STRONG\nGROWTH WITH GOOD VISIBILITY. THIS STORY'S WORKING.\n>> TODD, WHAT DO PEOPLE DO? WHAT'S THE ORDER OF REMODELING?\nWHAT'S THE MOST COMMON THING THAT THEY DO?\nKITCHENS AND BATHS, I GUESS, BUT WHAT ELSE?\nWHAT OTHER PARTS OF THE MARKET SHOULD WE BE LOOKING AT?\n>> SO IT DEPENDS ON WHICH SEGMENT'S GROWING.\nWE JUST PUT OUT A PIECE THAT BROUGHT OUT WITH THE SLOWDOWN IN\nEXISTING HOME SALES, FEWER HOMES FOR SALE MEANS FEWER POTENTIALLY\nEXISTING HOME SALES. MOVERS SPEND DIFFERENTLY THAN\nSTAYERS. IF YOU STAY IN YOUR HOME YOU'RE\nGOING TO SPEND ON SIDING, THAT'S POSITIVE.\nYOU'RE NOT GOING TO SPEND ON DECKING.\nWE KNOW PEOPLE SPEND ON DECKING MOVERS SPEND 90% MORE THAN\nNON-MOVERS, FOR SIDING IT'S THE OPPOSITE CLOSER TO 20% PLUS, THE\nOTHER THING I MENTION PEOPLE WHO STAY IN THEIR HOME SPEND AT A\nHIGHER PRICE POINT. AND THEY USUALLY HIRE PROS.\nDEPENDING ON WHICH CHANNEL YOU'RE LOOKING AT, YOU SHOULD\nSEE PEOPLE WHO DO THE PRO SHOPPING BETTER THEY SHOULD\nOUTPERFORM. >> SO IF YOUR NEIGHBOR PUTS A\nDECK ON, THEY'RE PROBABLY GOING TO MOVE.\n>> THEY'RE MOVING. THEY'RE OUT OF THERE.\n>> MY NEIGHBOR'S JUST REDID THEIR DECK.\n>> THAT'S A GREAT COCKTAIL PARTY NUMBER 90%.\n>> YEAH. >> MY NEIGHBOR JUST REDID THEIR\nDECK. >> MOVERS ARE DECKERS.\n>> BOB, THANK YOU. >> GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU.\nAPPRECIATE IT.",

NO, IT DOES NOT.\n>> WHAT IF THAT GUY SHOWS UP EVERY DAY UNTIL NOVEMBER 8th?\n>> WELL, IF THAT GUY SHOWS UP EVERY DAY UNTIL NOVEMBER 8th,\nTHAT WILL BE DIFFERENT -- A DIFFERENT PRESENTATION.\nI DO THINK THAT AT THIS POINT IN THE CAMPAIGN AMERICAN VOTERS\nHAVE DRAWN FAIRLY SOLID CONCLUSIONS ABOUT WHO HILLARY\nCLINTON IS, WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. >> I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT THAT UP\nBECAUSE AT THIS POINT IN THE CAMPAIGN KELLYANNE CONWAY SAID\nSHE DOESN'T GET MUCH ABOVE 41%. SHE HASN'T BROKEN THROUGH\nEITHER, NECESSARILY, DO YOU GIVE ANY CREDENCE TO HER ARGUMENT\nEITHER THAT WHAT WAS A HORRIFIC TWO WEEKS FOR DONALD TRUMP\nSHOULD HAVE BEEN HER MOMENT AND MAYBE SHE SHOULD HAVE\nCAPITALIZED ON IT? >> WELL, IT'S NOT RIGHT TO SAY\nSHE'S NOT ABOVE 41%.

SHE IS IN SOME OF THE\nBATTLEGROUND STATES, BUT, YES, HILLARY CLINTON IS A FLAWED\nCANDIDATE. SHE'S GOT A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER\nOF AMERICANS, MAJORITY OF AMERICANS WHO SAY THEY CAN'T\nTRUST HER. BUT BY ANY MEASURE, AND WHEN YOU\nLOOK AT THIS NATIONALLY AS WELL AS IN BATTLEGROUND STATES,\nDONALD TRUMP'S PROBLEMS ARE BIGGER.\nCAN HE REMEDIATE THOSE PROBLEMS BETWEEN NOW AND ELECTION DAY?\nI THINK IT'S HARD. I THINK IT'S DOUBTFUL.\nYOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING'S IMPOSSIBLE.\nIN A DIFFERENT PRESENTATION MIGHT BENEFIT HIM IN SOME WAY,\nBUT STILL WE KIND OF HAVE A PRETTY CLEAR PICTURE OF WHO\nDONALD TRUMP IS.

IN VIRGINIA AND COLORADO THEY\nHAVE ROUGHLY NINE, TEN, 11-POINT SPREADS.\nIS IT TOO SOON TO CALL THOSE STATES OR SHOULD TRUMP FORGET\nABOUT THEM AS WELL? >> THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS SUCH\nA MASSIVE CASH ADVANTAGE, WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO IT, YOU HAVE TO\nRESERVE THE TIME. IF YOU HAD MONEY, YOU COULD\nPROBABLY GET IN AT THE END IF YOU WERE CONCERNED ABOUT IT.\nIF YOU LOOK AT THE STATES WHERE THE CLINTONS ARE CONCERNED\nVERSUS THE STATES WHERE THEY'RE NOT, WHEN WE LOOK AT VIRGINIA\nAND COLORADO, THESE STATES HAVE INCREASINGLY LARGE NON-WHITE\nVOTER POPULATIONS AND MORE AFFLUENT WHITE VOTERS, MORE\nVOTERS WITH COLLEGE DEGREES. THAT HAS NOT BEEN THE SWEET SPOT\nFOR TRUMP. BUT THEN YOU FLIP THE OTHER\nSIDE, WHY IS NEVADA SO CLOSE? WHY IS IOWA SO CLOSE?\nWHY ARE THESE STATES THAT HAVE BEEN DEMOCRATIC FOR TWO CYCLES\nAND HAVE BEEN VERY STRONG FOR BARACK OBAMA, WHY ARE THEY OPEN\nTO TRUMP? THE ANSWER IS WE FLIP THE\nDEMOGRAPHICS, ON THE OTHER SIDE THESE ARE STATES THAT HAVE THE\nOPPOSITE DEMOCRAT MAKEUP AMONG THE ELECTORATE AS VIRGINIA AND\nCOLORADO. THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN WILL HAVE\nTO SPEND SOME TIME AND MONEY IN NEVADA WHERE DEMOCRATS WERE NOT\nEXPECTING TO. >> THERE ARE STATES THAT HAVE\nBEEN FLIPPED AND THOSE WHO ARE REGISTERING AS REPUBLICANS,\nLEAVING THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. A NUMBER OF KEY STATES, WE'VE\nGOT PENNSYLVANIA, FLORIDA, AND WE'VE GOT I THINK NORTH CAROLINA\nAS WELL, WHERE THE ROLES THERE FOR DEMOCRATS WHO ARE REGISTERED\nARE SHRINKING AND REPUBLICANS SAY, LOOK, THEY'RE COMING TO US,\nIT'S FLIPPING. WILL IT MATTER ON ELECTION DAY?\n>> WELL, IT ALL MATTERS. WE'RE ALL PART OF THIS GREAT\nFABRIC, THIS REPUBLIC OF OURS, SHANNON BREAM.\nWHETHER OR NOT IT'S DECISIVE, I DON'T KNOW.\nTHE ISSUE IS, WHEN YOU GET RIGHT DOWN TO IT, A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO\nWERE REPUBLICAN GENERAL ELECTION VOTERS WHO WEREN'T REGISTERED\nREPUBLICANS SWITCHED THEIR PARTY AFFILIATION TO VOTE IN THE\nPRIMARY, FOR TRUMP, AGAINST TRUMP, WHATEVER, BUT IN THE\nLARGEST TURNOUT REPUBLICAN PRIMARY WE EVER HAD, A LOT OF\nGENERAL ELECTION REPUBLICANS WHO VOWED NOT TO VOTE IN THE PRIMARY\nMOVED UP AND PUT THEIR BALLOTS IN IN THE PRIMARIES TOO.\nOVER THE NEXT SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS, WHEN THE DOOR CLOSES ON\nGENERAL ELECTION REGISTRATIONS, ARE REPUBLICANS KEEPING THIS\nTREND ALIVE? RIGHT NOW IT'S GOOD NEWS TO THIS\nPOINT. THE PARTY IS ENGAGED AND\nACTIVATED. WILL THAT TREND CONTINUE AND CAN\nDONALD TRUMP GET DEMOCRATS AND INDEPENDENTS TO SWITCH OVER AND\nFEEL THE GOP LOVE. >> HOW MANY PRESIDENTS HAVE COME\nFROM IOWA? WE'VE DONE SOME TRIVIA ON OHIO.\nWE ALSO HAVE A NEW POLL. THIS IS A MONMOUTH POLL SHOWING\nHILLARY CLINTON AT 43%, TRUMP AT 39, JOHNSON WITH 10%, JILL STEIN\nLESS THAN 1%. 10% IS A LOT OF PERCENTAGE\nPOINTS FOR GARY JOHNSON. DO THIRD PARTY PEOPLE SHOW UP,\nSHOULD THIS BE GOOD NEWS FOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN THAT THEY'RE\nWITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE ESPECIALLY IF THE UNDECIDEDS AND\nTHE GARY JOHNSONS DON'T TURN OUT?\n>> THE FACT THAT JILL STEIN IS ON THE BOARD WITH LESS THAN 1%,\nSHE'S THE ALLIGATOR THAT'S EATING THE 1%, YOU KNOW IT'S\nBAD. I THINK A LOT OF THIS IS PROTEST\nVOTES. THERE'S SOMETHING WE TALK ABOUT\nWHICH IS ESSENTIALLY THE VIABILITY THRESHOLD.\nAS YOU GET CLOSE TO THE ELECTION RIGHT NOW, A LOT OF VOTERS ARE\nDISSATISFIED -- VOTERS HAVE BEEN DISSATISFIED WITH BOTH MAJOR\nPARTIES FOR A COUPLE OF GENERATIONS, NOT SURPRISINGLY\nTHIS YEAR WITH TWO OF THE LEAST POPULAR MAJOR PARTY NOMINEES,\nYOU WOULD SEE A LOT OF DISAFFECTION.\nTHE REALITY IS, AS WE GET DOWN TO THE END, DOWN TO BAILING THE\nHAY, WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S REALLY 10% THERE FOR GARY\nJOHNSON OR A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE STAY HOME AND THEY'RE REALLY\nJUST TELLING A POLLSTER I WOULD LIKE TO VOTE BUT I CAN'T BRING\nMYSELF TO DO IT. >> BAILING HAY, EXCELLENT\nEXERCISE. I WOULDN'T KNOW.\n>> PASS. PASS.\nUNSUBSCRIBE. >> GOOD TO SEE YOU, CHRIS, THANK\nYOU VERY MUCH.",

THE CHANGES ARE VIEWED AS A WAY\nTO AVOID EVEN THE APPEARANCE OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST.\nIT BEGS THE QUESTION IF THAT'S THE GOAL, WHY WEREN'T THE\nCHANGES MADE WHEN CLINTON WAS SECRETARY OF STATE, DREW GRIFFIN\nREPORTS. >> Reporter: THIS IS A MAP OF\nTHE WORLD AND THESE ARE THE SPECIFIC COUNTRIES IN THIS WORLD\nTHAT HAVE GIVEN MILLIONS TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION OVER THE\nYEARS. $10 MILLION TO $25 MILLION FROM\nAUSTRALIA, NORWAY AND SAUDI ARABIA.\n$5 MILLION TO $10 MILLION FROM THE NETHERLANDS AND KUWAIT.\nBETWEEN $1 MILLION AND $5 PROSECUTE OHAN, UNITED ARAB\nEMIRATES AND BRUNEI. FOREIGN GROUPS MAKE UP A HUGE\nSHARE OF DONATIONS TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nTHE CAMPAIGN NOW SAYS IF HILLARY CLINTON BECOMES PRESIDENT, ANY\nFOREIGN DONATIONS LIKE THESE WILL NO LONGER BE ACCEPTED.\nCNN'S DANA BASH ASKED HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER WHY\nWAIT. >> WHY NOT DO IT NOW?\nWHY WAIT UNTIL THE IDEA OF HER BEING PRESIDENT?\nWHY NOT DO IT WHEN SHE IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT?\n>> WELL, THE FOUNDATION IS DOING AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WORK AND\nIT TAKES TIME WHEN YOU'RE IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES AROUND THE\nWORLD TO RETOOL, REFOCUS THE MISSION AND ADAPT.\n>> Reporter: AT THE HEART OF THE ISSUE IS CONFLICT OF INTEREST OR\nEVEN THE APPEARANCE OF ONE.

SO ANYTHING WRONG?\nNO. ALL ABOVE-BOARD, SAYS THE STATE\nDEPARTMENT. OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES\nAPPROVED THE DEAL. ALL THE RULES WERE FOLLOWED.\nAS THEY WERE IN ALL CASES INVOLVING MONSANTO.\nTHE FOOD GIANT HAS DONATED BETWEEN $1 MILLION AND $5\nMILLION TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION AND IT HAS HAD\nMULTIPLE PARTNERSHIP PROJECTS WITH THE CLINTON GLOBAL\nINITIATIVE. IN 2009, WHEN HILLARY CLINTON\nTOOK OFFICE AS SECRETARY OF STATE, MONSANTO WAS ACTIVELY\nLOBBYING THE STATE DEPARTMENT FOR HELPING PROMOTE AN OPEN\nMARKET FOR ITS BIOAGRICULTURAL PROJECTS ACROSS THE GLOBE.\nAND IT ALL COINCIDED WITH SECRETARY CLINTON'S GLOBAL\nPOLICY TO PROMOTE AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY.\nACCORDING TO CLINTON, SHE WAS PROMOTING U.S. AGRICULTURE AND\nESPECIALLY THE U.S. FARMER, MUCH LIKE HER REPUBLICAN PREDECESSOR\nDID.

DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN\nRAILING AGAINST THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, CALLING IT\nCORRUPT AND THAT'S NOT ALL IS HE TALKING ABOUT AT A\nCAMPAIGN RALLY IN OHIO. LET'S LISTEN LIVE.\n>> WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A NEW IMMIGRATION SCREENING\nTEST TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT OF OUR COUNTRY WHO DON'T\nSUPPORT OUR TOLERANT VALUES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]\nWE ARE GOING TO HAVE EXTREME REMEMBER, EXTREME VETTING.\nWE WANT PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY, BUT WE WANT PEOPLE\nTHAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO LOVE US AND RESPECT US.\nWE ARE ALSO GOING TO REJECT THE BIGOTRY UP OF HILLARY\nCLINTON WHO SEES PEOPLE OF COLOR ONLY AS VOTES AND NOT\nAS HUMAN BEINGS WORTHY OF A BETTER FUTURE.\nSO TRUE. THAT IS SO TRUE.\n[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS RUN\nNEARLY EVERY INNER CITY FOR 50 YEARS, 60 YEARS, 70\nYEARS, AND EVEN MORE THAN 100 YEARS THEY HAVE PRODUCED\nONLY POVERTY, FAILING SCHOOLS, AND BROKEN HOMES IN\nTHE LAST EIGHT YEARS, THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN LABOR FORCE\nPARTICIPATION HAS DECLINED ANOTHER 3 PERCENTAGE POINTS\nAND IT'S DROPPED ANOTHER SIX PERCENTAGE POINTS FOR\nTEENAGERS AND THAT'S ALREADY FROM THE MOST DISMAL NUMBERS\nIN HISTORY. NEARLY FOUR IN TEN\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN CHILDREN LIVE IN POVERTY.\n[CROWD BOOS] >> AFRICAN-AMERICAN HOME\nOWNERSHIP HAS DECLINED NEARLY 10 PERCENTAGE POINTS\nFROM RECORD LEVELS. THIS IS JUST IN THE LAST\nSHORT WHILE. ALSO, SINCE 2009, ANOTHER\n2 MILLION LATINOS HAVE FALLEN IN TO POVERTY.\n[CROWD BOOS] INCOME FOR LATINO WORKERS FELL BY\nALMOST ANOTHER $1,000 A YEAR, AGAIN, BY TERRIBLE\nSTANDARDS. MEANWHILE HOMICIDES ARE UP\nBY NEARLY 50% IN WASHINGTON, D.C. AND MORE THAN 60% IN\nBALTIMORE AND UP ALL OVER THE PLACE, NO MATTER WHERE\nYOU LOOK. THE LEVEL OF CRIME IN THESE\nCITIES IS SOMETHING NO AMERICAN SHOULD CONSIDER\nACCEPTABLE. IT SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED\nACCEPTABLE. [ APPLAUSE ]\n>> THAT IS, OF COURSE, DONALD TRUMP IS HE LIVE IN\nAKRON, OHIO. WE WILL KEEP MONITORING THE\nEVENT FOR ANY NEWS. RIGHT NOW, LET'S LISTEN TO\nWHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION JUST\nMOMENTS AGO. >> HILLARY CLINTON IS EITHER\nTOO CORRUPT OR TOO COWARDLY TO MEET WITH THE FAMILIES OF\nTHOSE KILLED BY THE POLICIES SHE AND OBAMA SUPPORT.\n[CROWD BOOS] >> HILLARY CLINTON HAS\nTOTALLY FORGOTTEN THE FIRST RULE OF PUBLIC SERVICE, THE\nJOB OF AN ELECTED OFFICIAL IS TO SERVE THE CITIZENS OF\nTHE UNITED STATES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]\nTHAT'S WHAT THE JOB IS. AND IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND\nTHAT THEN YOU ARE NOT FIT TO RUN FOR THE OFFICE OF\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\n[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IF YOU ARE NOT PREPARED TO\nPUT AMERICAN WORKERS FIRST, THEN YOU SHOULD NOT HOLD OR\nSEEK PUBLIC OFFICE. WE'RE NOT WORKING FOR\nSOMEBODY ELSE. WE'RE NOT WORKING FOR\nANOTHER COUNTRY. IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE NO\nISSUE BETTER ILLUSTRATES HOW CORRUPT MY OPPONENT IS THAN\nHER PAY FOR PLAY SCANDALS AS SECRETARY OF STATE.\n[CROWD BOOS. AS THE EVIDENCE HAS BECOME\nPUBLIC OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS, I HAVE BECOME\nINCREASINGLY SHOCKED BY THE VAST SCOPE OF HILLARY\nHILLARYCLINTON'S CRIMINALITY. EVERYBODY KNOWS IT OUR\nCOUNTRY HAS GONE SO FAR BEHIND, EVERYBODY KNOWS.\nIT HILLARY CLINTON SAID SHE TURNED OVER ALL OF HER\nWORK-RELATED EMAILS. [CHANTING LOCK HER UP]\nSHOE TESTIFIED TO CONGRESS UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY NOW\nWE LEARN ABOUT ANOTHER 15,000 EMAILS SHE FAILED TO\nTURN OVER AND THEY HAVE JUST BEEN DISCOVERED, I GUESS\nTODAY. [CROWD BOOS]\n>> AND DON'T FORGET THE 33,000 EMAILS SHE HAS\nALREADY DELETED COLIN POWELL JUST PROVED AGAIN HOW\nDISHONEST HILLARY CLINTON IS AFTER HE BUSTED HER FOR\nTRYING TO PIN THE EMAIL SCANDAL ON HIM.\nONE MORE HILLARY CLINTON E.COLI.\nHER FOUNDATION TOOK IN LARGE PAYMENTS FROM MAJOR\nCORPORATIONS AND WEALTHY INDIVIDUALS, FOREIGN AND\nDOMESTIC, AND ALL THE WHILE, SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE.\nTHE CLINTON FOUNDATION ACCEPTED AS MUCH AS\n$60 MILLION FROM MIDDLE EASTERN COUNTRIES THAT\nOPPRESS WOMEN, GUYS, AND PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT FAITHS.\nAFTER THE FBI AND DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WHITE WASHED\nHILLARY CLINTON'S EMAIL CRIMES, THEY CERTAINLY\nCANNOT BE TRUSTED TO QUICKLY OR IMPARTIALLY INVESTIGATE\nHILLARY CLINTON'S NEW CRIMES, WHICH HAPPEN ALL THE\nTIME SOME FORMER PROSECUTORS HAVE EVEN SUGGESTED THAT THE\nCOORDINATION BETWEEN THE PAY FOR PLAY STATE DEPARTMENT\nAND CLINTON FOUNDATION CONSTITUTE A CLEAR EXAMPLE\nOF RICCO, RACKETEERING, INFLUENCE, CORRUPT\nORGANIZATION ENTERPRISE. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS\nREQUIRED TO APPOINT AN INDEPENDENT SPECIAL\nPROSECUTOR BECAUSE IT HAS PROVEN ITSELF TO BE REALLY,\nSADLY, A POLITICAL ARM OF THE WHITE HOUSE.\nNOBODY HAS EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE\nTHE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS ACTED VERY UNETHICALLY,\nPARTICULARLY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S PRIVATE LENGTHY 39\nMINUTE MEETING IN THE BACK OF AN AIR PLANE BEFORE THE\nDEPARTMENT'S DECISION. [CROWD BOOS]\n>> NOT TO PROSECUTE HER FOR CRIMES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN\nPROSECUTED AGAINST ANY OTHER CITIZEN IN OUR COUNTRY.\n>> AND YOU JUST HEARD DONALD TRUMP IN AKRON, OHIO, RAIL\nAGAINST THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nWE ARE MONITORING HIS LIVE RALLY THAT'S GOING ON THERE\nNOW FOR ANY NEWS. YOU GUESSED IT.\nSHE IS NOT JUST GETTING SLAMMED BY DONALD TRUMP,\nOTHER CALLS ARE COMING TO SHUT DOWN THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION YOU CAN STILL ASSURE THE PEOPLE THAT THE\nCLINTON STATE DEPARTMENT MAINTAINED AT ALL POINTS\nDISTANCE FROM THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\n>> WE HAVE SEEN NO EVIDENCE OF ANY BEHAVIOR, ANY\nRELATIONS WITH THE CLINTON FOUNDATION THAT WEREN'T\nCOMPLETELY ABOVE BOARD. >> IT WAS PAY FOR PLAY.\n>> SHE IS THOROUGHLY CORRUPT AND SO IS THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION. THEY NEED TO CHANGE THE WAY\nTHEY HAVE DONE BUSINESS. THEY INDICATED THEY WILL.\nTHEY ARE NEVER GOING TO STOP.\nNUMBER ONE THEY SHOULD SHUT IT DOWN JOB AS U.S.\nATTORNEY. I WOULD INDICT THE CLINT\nFOUNDATION DON'T JUST START SOME NEW PROCESS UP ALL OVER\nAGAIN. THAT'S ALL THE PEOPLE LIVE\nOFF OF OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY. >> WE SHOWED YOU DONALD\nTRUMP'S RESPONSE TO THIS LATEST NEWS, BUT HERE NOW IS\nCOLORADO GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT.\nGOOD EVENING, SIR. WE HAVE AN AD UP THAT\nBASICALLY TALKS ABOUT THIS. SHE SAID THEY WALKED OUT OF\nTHE WHITE HOUSE BROKE. THEY STARTED A FOUNDATION.\nTODAY THEY $100 MILLION HOW WOULD YOU DO THAT?\n>> I LOOKED IT UP AND WANT TO KNOW WHETHER SHE IS WORTH\n100 MILLION OR NOT. HE THE RANGE WE GOT\n11 MILLION TO 50 MILLION. I'M NOT DENYING THAT'S A\nHUGE SUM OF MONEY, BUT EVERYONE KEEPS SAYING\n11 MILLION. 50 MILLION IS A LOT.\n11 MILLION IS A WHOLE LOT. ANYWAY, I KNOW -- I MEAN,\nTHEY GAVE A LOT OF SPEECHES BUT EVEN THAT IS UNDER FIRE\nBECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THERE IS ONE SPEECH FOR $750,000 THAT\nBILL CLINTON IS GETTING HEAT FOR IT WOULD BE SMART TORE\nSIT DOWN AND ANSWER QUESTIONS AND SHE'LL AT THE\nDEBATE, I ASSUME. >> ON TOP OF THAT, THEY\nACKNOWLEDGED NOW THAT THEY ARE GOING TO STOP TAKEN THIS\nFOREIGN MONEY. WHY DID THEY DO IT WHILE SHE\nWAS SECRETARY OF STATE? IF IT'S CORRUPTION NOW, WHY\nWASN'T IT CORRUPTION BEFORE? IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.\n>> TODAY OUTLINED SOMETHING THAT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION\nHAS DONE. DO YOU THINK THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION HAS DONE ANY GOOD IN THE WORLD?\n>> I PERSONALLY HAVEN'T SEEN IT.\nI MEAN, I WAS TALKING TO SOMEBODY THE OTHER DAY ABOUT\nHAITI AND THEY SAID HE WOULD NOT BE WELCOME TO GO BACK\nTHERE BUT WHO KNOWS. I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY ENOUGH\nABOUT WHAT THE FOUNDATION HAS DONE.\nWHAT I DO KNOW IS THEY WALK OUT BROKE, THEY START A\nFOUNDATION, AND THEY ARE WORTH A LOT OF MONEY.\nTHAT'S NOT -- I MEAN, THEY ARE PUBLIC SERVANTS.\nTHAT'S NAU NOT HOW YOU BECOME WEALTHY.\nYOU DON'T BECOME WEALTHY AS A PUBLIC SERVANT.\nTHEY ARE TRYING TO GET THE AD TAKEN DOWN THAT WE HAVE\nUP RIGHT NOW. WE ARE CONTINUING TO RAISE\nMONEY TO KEEP THIS MESSAGE UP THERE THIS IS WRONG WHAT\nTHEY HAVE BEEN DOING. >> LET ME BRING THE VIEWERS\nIN ON THIS NOW. BECAUSE I LIKE TO HAVE THEM\nVOTE AT HOME ON TWITTER. HERE IS THE QUESTION TO THE\nVIEWERS. SHOULD THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION BE SHUT DOWN? TWEET YES OR NO USING\n#GRETA. WE'LL SHOW YOU LIVE TWITTER\nVOTES THROUGHOUT THE SHOW. GOVERNOR SCOTT, SO, WHAT\nSHOULD HAPPEN? DO YOU THINK IT SHOULD BE\nSHUT DOWN? DO YOU THINK BILL CLINTON\nSHOULD GET OUT OF IT? WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO WITH\nTHE CLINTON FOUNDATION? A LOT OF MONEY THERE.\nI IMAGINE A LOT OF IT IS PLEDGED ALL OVER THE WORLD\nAND I IMAGINE ENORMOUSLY COMPLICATED.\n>> I THOUGHT IT OUGHT TO BE SHUT DOWN.\nTHEY OUGHT TO DO WHAT THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE BEFORE.\nGIVE ALL THAT MONEY BACK. THEY SHOULD HAVE NEVER TAKEN\nMONEY FROM FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS.\nESPECIALLY GOVERNMENT -- LOOK, IT'S GOVERNMENTS THAT\nDON'T BELIEVE IN WHAT THE AMERICA BELIEVES.\nIN THEY ARE GOVERNMENTS THAT HAD CONTRACTS OR DOING\nBUSINESS WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE.\nTHAT IS WRONG.

SO THE QUESTION I WANT YOU TO\nADDRESS IS, JUDICIAL WATCH IS LEAVING THIS INFERENCE THERE\nTHAT YOU PAY TO THE FOUNDATION AND YOU GET TO SEE THE SECRETARY\nOF STATE. CAN YOU SAY NO, THAT'S JUST NOT\nTRUE, THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS? >> WHAT I WOULD SAY IS WE HAVE\nNO CLEAR SIGN THAT THAT WAS THE CASE.\nWE SEE NO EVIDENCE THAT THAT WAS THE CASE.\nJAMES, GO AHEAD. >> THAT'S ALL RIGHT.\nIN A RELATED VEIN, I SHOULD SAY THAT IN FAIRNESS TO JUDICIAL\nWATCH, I THINK THEIR PUBLIC RELATIONS PEOPLE WOULD BE VERY\nDISPLEASED IF THE RECORD WERE ALLOWED TO STAND THAT THEY HAD\nLEFT SUCH THINGS TO INFERENCE. THEY MAKE IT RATHER EXPLICIT.\n>> I STAND CORRECTED. >> FOX NEWS HAS OBTAINED AND\nSHARED WITH YOUR OFFICE 180 PAGES OF CALL LOGS FROM THE\nOFFICE OF CHERYL MILLS COVERING A TWO-YEAR PERIOD WHEN SHE WAS\nCHIEF OF STAFF TO SECRETARY CLINTON.\nTHE INDIVIDUAL WHO LEFT THE GREATEST NUMBER OF MESSAGES FOR\nMS. MILLS BY AN EXPONENTIAL ORDER WAS LAURA GRAHAM, THEN THE\nCHIEF OPERATING OFFICER FOR THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, CLOSE TO 150\nIN A TWO-YEAR TIME FRAME. AS YOU KNOW, THIS EVIDENCE\nARISES AT A TIME WHEN MANY QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT\nWHETHER THE CLINTON STATE DEPARTMENT AND SPECIFICALLY MS.\nMILLS MAINTAINED AN APPROPRIATE DISTANCE FROM THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION. CAN YOU TELL US WHY MS. GRAHAM\nAND MS. MILLS WERE IN SUCH CLOSE AND CONSTANT CONTACT?\n>> WELL, A COUPLE OF THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THIS.\nFIRST OF ALL, JUST TO STEP BACK AND ADDRESS WHAT JAMES IS\nREFERRING TO, THESE ARE LOGS THAT WERE IN EFFECT\nSPREADSHEETS, THAT WERE MAINTAINED BY WHO WAS THEN AN\nASSISTANT TO CHIEF OF STAFF CHERYL MILLS TO TRACK, AS YOU\nCAN IMAGINE, THIS LARGE VOLUME OF CALLS SHE RECEIVES ON A LARGE\nRANGE OF ISSUES. AND THESE DOCUMENTS WERE\nRELEASED THROUGH THE FOIA PROCESS, I THINK BACK IN APRIL.\nSO IT'S NO SURPRISE, THE STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS ARE IN\nCONTACT WITH A RANGE OF OUTSIDE INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS,\nINCLUDING NONPROFITS, NGOs, AND OF COURSE THINK TANKS AND\nOTHERS. THAT'S CERTAINLY TRUE WITH MS.\nMILLS. I WOULD ALSO STATE THAT -- AND\nAGAIN, I DON'T KNOW IF I'M INFERRING FROM YOUR QUESTION, I\nWOULDN'T WANT TO DO THAT, BUT SECRETARY CLINTON'S ETHICS\nAGREEMENT AT THE TIME DID NOT PRECLUDE OTHER STATE DEPARTMENT\nOFFICIALS FROM ENGAGING WITH OR HAVING CONTACT WITH THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION. SO YOU'RE RIGHT, THERE ARE THESE\nI GUESS APPROXIMATELY 150 MESSAGES.\nI CAN'T READOUT OF EVERY ONE OF THOSE CALLS, HOW MANY OF THEM\nWERE RETURNED OR CONNECTED. ALL I CAN SAY, AND I WOULD GO\nBACK TO, AGAIN, WHAT I JUST EXPLAINED TO ARSHAD, I WOULD\nNOTE THAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT AT THE TIME WAS AND CERTAINLY\nCHERYL MILLS INDIVIDUALLY WAS A COORDINATING HUB FOR U.S. AND\nINTERNATIONAL EFFORTS FOR RELIEF EFFORTS IN THE HAITI EARTHQUAKE.\nCHERYL MILLS LED THOSE EFFORTS THROUGHOUT HER TENURE HERE.\nAND FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON ALSO PLAYED A ROLE AS THE\nCOORDINATOR OF RELIEF EFFORTS IN HIS ROLE AS SPECIAL U.N. ENVOY\nFOR HAITI. SO AGAIN, I DON'T WANT TO\nSPECULATE, BUT THAT COULD BE THE REASON WHY THERE WERE THESE\nCALLS, SIMPLY COORDINATING ON WHAT WAS ONE OF THE PREMIER OR\nMOST SIGNIFICANT FOREIGN RELATIONS ISSUES AT THE TIME.\n>> ON ONE INDICATION MS. GRAHAM LEFT A MESSAGE TO MS. MILLS\nREFERENCING, QUOTE, OUR BOSS, UNQUOTE.\nDID MS. GRAHAM AND MS. MILLS HAVE THE SAME BOSS?\n>> I CAN'T SPECULATE AS TO WHO THEY MEANT.\n>> I DIDN'T ASK THAT. I ASKED DID THEY HAVE THE SAME\nBOSS. >> THEY DID NOT HAVE THE SAME\nBOSS, I CAN SAY THAT. >> WAS APPROPRIATE SEPARATION\nMAINTAINED AT ALL POINTS? >> AGAIN, WE HAVE SEEN NO\nEVIDENCE OF BEHAVIOR OR RELATIONS WITH THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION THAT WEREN'T COMPLETELY ABOVE BOARD, AND IN\nTHIS CASE IT'S LIKELY THAT WHAT THEY WERE DEALING WITH DURING\nMANY OF THESE CALLS WAS THE AFTERMATH OF THE HAITI EARTHQUAKE.\n>> AND FINALLY, SINCE WE JUST TOUCHED ONMS. ABEDIN, \"THE NEW\nYORK POST\" HAVE NOTED HER PRESENCE ON THE MAST HEAD OF A\nJOURNAL THAT PUBLISHED FAIRLY VILE THINGS INCLUDING U.S.'S\nRESPONSIBILITY FOR 9/11 INCLUDING WRITINGS BY HER\nMOTHER. WHEN SHE WAS CLEARED TO WORK IN\nTHE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, ONE OF THE TWO JOBS SHE HELD DOWN\nDURING HER TENURE HERE, WAS MS. ABEDIN'S ASSOCIATION WITH THIS\nJOURNAL KNOWN TO THE SECRETARY OR ANYONE ELSE IN THIS BUILDING?\n>> I DON'T HAVE AN IMMEDIATE ANSWER FOR YOU ON THAT.\nI HAVEN'T SEEN THESE REPORTS, TO BE HONEST.\nWHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT WE WOULDN'T NORMALLY TALK ABOUT\nSOMEONE'S CLEARANCE PROCESS EXCEPT TO SAY THAT HAVING GONE\nTHROUGH THE SECURITY CLEARANCE PROCESS AND CONSIDERING THE\nLEVEL OF CLEARANCE SHE WOULD HAVE NEEDED FOR THE JOB THAT SHE\nHELD, I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT SHE WAS, LIKE ANY INDIVIDUAL WOULD\nBE, FULLY VETTED. BUT I CAN'T SPEAK TO THESE\nSPECIFIC ALLEGATIONS. >> THE PRESENCE OF THE STATE\nDEPARTMENT EMPLOYEE OR A PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYEE ON THE\nMASTHEAD OF A JOURNAL THAT IS PUBLISHED AND DISSEMINATED COULD\nTYPICALLY -- >> WE WANT TO BRING IN CHIEF\nINTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT CATHERINE HERRIDGE, SHE'S LIVE\nIN WASHINGTON AS WE'VE BEEN MONITORING THE STATE DEPARTMENT\nBRIEFING TODAY. A LOT OF TOUGH QUESTIONS, A LOT\nOF HESITATION FROM MARK TONER. >> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT,\nSHANNON. THREE MAJOR TAKEAWAYS.\nWE'VE GOT THESE NEWLY RELEASED E-MAILS FROM JUDICIAL WATCH THAT\nRELATE TO CLINTON AIDE HUMA ABEDIN.\nSHE HAS BEEN THE FOCUS OF A CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION\nBECAUSE SHE WORE MULTIPLE HATS DEPARTMENT.\nA STATE DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEE, ALSO AN EMPLOYEE FOR THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION, THEN ALSO THIS CLINTON-ALIGNED CONSULTING GROUP\nCALLED TANEO. THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THERE\nWAS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST. THE SECOND IS ABOUT THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION AND WHETHER ONE COULD DRAW THE CONCLUSION THAT WHEN\nTHE CROWN PRESENCE OF BAHRAIN GIVES A $32 MILLION DONATION TO\nTHE CLINTON FOUNDATION, THIS REALLY PAVED THE WAY FOR AN\nIN-PERSON MEETING WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE.\nMARK TONER SAID THEY DID NOT SEE EVIDENCE OF THAT BEING THE CASE,\nALTHOUGH ONE HAS TO WONDER WHAT EVIDENCE THEY WOULD NEED TO\nREACH THAT CONCLUSION AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT, BECAUSE\nUNFORTUNATELY ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE SEEN IN OUR ONGOING\nREPORTING IS THAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAS NOT BEEN SORT OF\nA NEUTRAL ARBITER OF THE FACTS ALWAYS WHEN IT COMES TO THE\nCLINTON E-MAILS AND THE FOUNDATION.\nTHEY HAVE REALLY ALMOST BECOME HER DEFENDER IN CHIEF IN MANY\nRESPECTS. >> CATHERINE HERRIDGE REPORTING\nLIVE ON WHAT WE'RE SEEING OUT OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT NOW.\nWE ARE GOING TO GET REACTION NOW WITH CONGRESSMAN JASON CHAFFETZ\nJOINING US IN STUDIO, CHAIRMAN OF THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE.\nWHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THESE NEW REGULATIONS AND THE TOUGH TIME\nTONER IS HAVING IN TRYING TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT\nUNEARTHED E-MAILS WE HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE, E-MAILS SUGGESTING\nTHAT ACCESS TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE WAS THROUGH THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION? AND BY THE WAY, ALLEGATIONS THAT\nSHE AND THE CLINTON FOUNDATION ARE DENYING.\n>> HE CAN'T DEFINE SOMETHING BECAUSE HE'S LEFT IN THE DARK.\nWHEN THIS WAS START, HILLARY CLINTON CREATED THIS SYSTEM AND\nITS RELATIONSHIP WITH HERSELF, SOMETHING THAT THE INSPECTOR\nGENERAL FOUND SO PROBLEMATIC THAT HE REFERRED THE MATTER TO\nTHE FBI FOR CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION.\nAND SO HE'S LEFT NOT BEING ABLE TO DEFINITIVELY DEFEND HER OR\nTELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT ASSETS, THE\nASSETS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WERE NOT COMMINGLED\nWITH BOTH THE CLINTON FOUNDATION AND WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE.\n>> OKAY. NOW, IT'S THE ISSUE OF THE FBI.\nYOU HAVE AUTHORED A LETTER WITH CONGRESSMAN GOODLATTE OF THE\nJUDICIARY COMMITTEE, ASKING AND POINTING OUT, AFTER FBI DIRECTOR\nJAMES COMEY'S STATEMENTS, ASKING WHETHER A PERJURY INVESTIGATION\nWILL BE AN ISSUE TO ADDRESS TO THE U.S. ATTORNEY IN DC, WHERE\nIS THAT GOING TO GO? IS IT A WITCH HUNT?\n>> IT'S PRETTY STUNG THAT THE FBI DIRECTOR CAME BEFORE THE\nMEMBERS OF THE HOUSE AND SAID THAT DURING THEIR YEAR-LONG\nINVESTIGATION OF THE LIES AND WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH HILLARY\nCLINTON'S E-MAILS, THAT THEY NEVER LOOKED AT HILLARY\nCLINTON'S TESTIMONY UNDER OATH. I MEAN, THAT WAS PRETTY\nSTUNNING. IT'S PUBLIC RECORD.\nYOU RAISE YOUR RIGHT HAND, YOU SWEAR TO TELL THE TRUTH, THE\nWHOLE TRUTH, AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH, BUT THE FBI DIDN'T LOOK\nAT THAT?  PERMISSION SLIP FROM CONGRESS,\nWHICH WE GAVE THEM. CLEARLY WHAT SHE SAID AND WHAT\nSHE DID WERE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS, AND THAT'S LYING TO\nCONGRESS. >> IS THERE A TIMELINE ON THAT?\n>> SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. THE FBI GAVE US ON TUESDAY, IN A\nSECRET FORMAT, IN THE SECRET FACILITY IN THE HOUSE, BUT\nCHOCK-FULL OF REDAREDACTIONS. THERE ARE THINGS SO SENSITIVE IN\nTHERE THAT I CAN'T EVEN LOOK AT THEM.\nAT THE SAME TIME, HILLARY CLINTON IS STILL TELLING\nEVERYBODY THAT THERE WERE NO E-MAILS THAT I SENT, NO E-MAILS\nTHAT I RECEIVED THAT CONTAINED CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.\n>> HER CAMP KEEPS SAYING IF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS GOING TO\nRELEASE IT AT ALL, THEY WANT IT TO GO TO EVERYBODY, INCLUDING\nME, SOMEONE WITH NO NATIONAL SECURITY CLEARANCE.\nARE YOU SAYING WHAT THEY'RE PRODUCING IS SO REDACTED IT\nWOULDN'T MAKE SENSE TO THE AVERAGE PERSON?\n>> IT IS TERRIBLY IRRESPONSIBLE FOR HILLARY CLINTON TO SAY\nTHINGS SHOULD BE RELEASED. IT PUTS PEOPLE'S LIVES IN\nDANGER. SHE STILL DOESN'T GET IT.\nWHAT WE'RE ASKING THE FBI TO DO IS CREATE AN UNCLASSIFIED\nVERSION AND THEN RELEASE THAT TO THE PUBLIC.\nTHAT TO ME IS AVAILABLE ON THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT,\nLET'S GO AHEAD AND GET THAT OUT THERE SOONER RATHER THAN LATER.\nIF IT'S TRUE THAT THE HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN AND SHE\nPERSONALLY WANTS THAT INFORMATION OUT THERE, THEN\nLET'S DO IT RESPONSIBLY, NOT THE WAY SHE WANTS TO DO IT WHICH IS\nJUST RELEASE EVERYTHING. THAT PUTS PEOPLE'S LIVES IN\nDANGER. >> SOME PEOPLE QUESTION WHETHER\nTHEY REALLY DO WANT THE FULL RELEASE, WE'LL SEE.\nI WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THESE E-MAILS SURFACING TODAY,\nFROM JUDICIAL WATCH'S WORK. WE'VE A VERY CLOSE CONFIDENT OF\nPRESIDENT CLINTON, CONNECTED TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, SENDING\nAN E-MAIL TO HUM HUMA ABEDIN. SHE SAYS SHE DOESN'T WANT TO\nCOMMIT TO ANYTHING. THAT CONTINUES ON, THEN HUMA\nABEDIN RESPONDS AND SAYS, OFFERING A MEETING WITH HRC, LET\nHIM KNOW, WE HAVE REACHED OUT THROUGH OFFICIAL CHANNELS.\nAPPARENTLY THE STORY GOES WHEN THEY REACHED OUT TO OFFICIAL\nCHANNELS THEY COULDN'T GET TO HER, WHEN THEY REACHED OUT\nTHROUGH THE CLINTON FOUNDATION CHANNELS THEY COULD GET TO HER,\nAND HE MADE A SIZABLE COMMITMENT OR DONATION.\n>> THIS HAS HAPPENED BY THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.\nTHAT BEGS THE QUESTION, AND I THINK IT'S A LEGITIMATE\nQUESTION. THEY'VE CREATED THIS PROBLEM,\nTHE CLINTONS THIS, BY HAVING THIS ENTITY, AND NOW WITH JAMES\nROSEN REPORTING THROUGH THE GOOD WORK OF JUDICIAL WATCH AND\nOTHERS, THAT HERE ARE 150 MESSAGES LEFT BY THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION TO THE CHIEF OF STAFF TO SECRETARY CLINTON.\nCOME ON. IT DOESN'T TAKE BUT A THIRD\nGRADER TO ADD THIS UP AND SAY, WOW, YOU GIVE TENS OF MILLIONS\nOF DOLLARS TO THE FOUNDATION, AND THEN YOU GET THE ACCESS THAT\nYOU WANT. I THINK THAT'S A LEGITIMATE\nQUESTION THAT EVEN THE STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON WHEN\nGIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY COULD NOT REFUTE.\n>> HE HAD A TOUGH TIME OF IT. THROUGH HER CAMPAIGN, ANY\nOFFICIAL CHANNELS THERE ARE SAYING THERE IS NOTHING THERE,\nNO CONNECTION. >> THEN SHE SHOULD HAVE A PRESS\nCONFERENCE. SHE'S BEEN 261 DAYS WITHOUT A\nPRESS CONFERENCE. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU\nHAVE A CANDIDATE THAT JUST HIDES AND DOESN'T ANSWER QUESTIONS.\nTHAT'S WHAT HAPPENS, YOU'RE LEFT WITH MORE AND MORE QUESTIONS.\nSHE NEEDS TO HAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE AND LET THE MEDIA ASK\nHER. >> WE WOULD LOVE TO.\nWE HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS. WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT.\nCHAIRMAN, GOOD TO SEE YOU,",

ON FRIDAY POWELL'S OFFICE TOLD\nNBC HE DID WRITE FORMER SECRETARY CLINTON A MEMO\nDESCRIBING THE USE OF HIS PERSONAL AOL ACCOUNT FOR\nUNCLASSIFIED MESSAGES. ON SATURDAY NIGHT AT A PARTY IN\nTHE HAMPTONS HE SAID HER PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TRY TO GO PIN IT ON\nME. THE TRUTH IS SHE WAS YOOGING THE\nPRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER FOR A YEAR BEFORE I TOLD HER WHAT I DID.\nJASON JOHNSON HERE AND MICHAEL, A FORMER SENIOR ADVISER OF JEB\nBUSH. SO WHAT DO WE MAKE OF THIS?\nI'M TRYING TO PUT THEM ALL TOGETHER.\nHILLARY CLINTON WE KNOW IS A FACTOR.\nI HAVE BEEN USING THIS SINCE I BECAME SECRETARY OF STATE.\nTHERE IS THIS PARTY SHE WAS AT  ALBRIGHT ASKED FOR EVERYONE TO\nGIVE ADVICE AND POWELL COMES OUT ON SATURDAY NIGHT AND TELLS\nPEOPLE MAGAZINE THAT WAS A YEAR LATER.\nSO WHAT DO WE THINK OF THIS? >> WELL, MANY THINGS --\n>> IS THIS A FACT ARGUMENT? >> HERE ARE THE FACTS.\nSHE WAS ALREADY USING THE SERVER --\n>> WHAT ABOUT WHERE SHE WAS NEXT SECRETARY OF STATE.\nIT MEANS SHE HAS HASN'T TAKEN OE YET.\n>> SHE WAS DOING IT FROM THE BEGINNING.\n>> SO IF YOU TRUST POWELL AND YOU BELIEVE POWELL IS RIGHT\nABOUT THE E-MAIL YOU CAN'T BELIEVE HILLARY CLINTON WHEN SHE\nBLAMES HER DECISION ON HIS DECISION EARLIER!\nRIGHT AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE WHAT SHE DID AND WHAT HE DID ARE\nDIFFERENT. HE USE ADD PRIVATE E-MAIL\nACCOUNT FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND STATE DEPARTMENT FOR CLASSIFIED\nCOMMUNICATION. AT THAT POINT THERE WERE NOT\nE-MAIL RULES IN PLACE. >> WE DON'T HAVE TO GET TO THAT DISTINCTION.\n>> AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK. >> THAT'S WHERE THE BLAME GAME\nCOMES IN. IF SHE DID IT ON HER OWN BECAUSE\nSHE WANTED TO DO IT, SHE AND BILL AND WHOEVER DECIDED IT, WHY\nIS SHE BLAMING IT ON COLLIN POWELL?\n>> BECAUSE IT IS EASY AND CONVENIENT.\nPOWELL IS LIKE I'M NOT INVOLVED IN THIS.\n>> USUALLY IF YOU'RE GOING TO BLAME IT ON SOMEBODY ELSE YOU\nFIGURE THEY WILL GO ALONG WITH IT.\n>> THEY TRYING TO RENT THE CREDIBILITY OF A DISTINGUISHED\nPUBLIC SERVICE, A STATES MAN AS A TALKING POINT TO EXPLAIN THIS\nAWAY. POWELL WASN'T LOOKING FOR FIGHT.\nHE IS GOING TO A PARTY ON A SATURDAY NIGHT AND SOMEBODY WHO\nIS SNAPPING PICTURES ON THE RED CARPET ASKED HIM ABOUT IT.\nHIS RESPONSE IS NO, I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE ABOUT THIS.\nHE CALLED THEM ON IT. >> WHY IS THIS STORY, WHICH IS\nDIFFICULTY GETTING SITED ABOUT. EVERYBODY SAYS SCANDAL, SCANDAL,\nSCANDAL. WE FLOW WHAT HAPPENED.\nIT HAS BEEN DIGESTED BY EVERY AMERICAN.\nHILLARY SHOWS A SECRET METHOD OF DOING PHONE CALLS.\nIT IS AT SOME RISK TO BEING HIJACKED BY SOMEBODY.\nSHE APOLOGIZED FOR IT. WHERE DO WE GO FROM THAT?\nISN'T THAT THE END OF IT? >> THE PROBLEM SHE KEEPS RUNNING\nINTO, SHE HAS APOLOGIZED FOR IT. INSTEAD OF TAKING RESPONSIBILITY\nFOR IT THEY KEEP TRYING TO HAVE OTHER PEOPLE VOUCH FOR HER.\nSHE ALSO TRY TODAY SUGGEST THAT COMEY WOULD VOUCH FOR HER.\nWHEN SHE SUGGESTED THAT HE SAID EVERYTHING SHE SAID WAS\nTRUTHFUL, WHICH IS NOT WHAT HE SAID.\nIF SHE WOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND SAY WHAT I DID WAS DIFFERENT\nTHAN ANY OTHER SECRETARY OF STATE DID THAT WOULD BE ONE\nTHING. WHEN SHE TRIES TO ROPE OTHER\nPEOPLE IN -- >> YOU KNOW, AFTER NIXON WAS\nCAUGHT TAPING LIKE ALL OF THE GREAT LIBERALS, KENNEDY TAPED\nOVER AND OVER AGAIN AND JOHNSON REPPED TAPE.\nSO THIS KIND OF PHONEYNESS, I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.\nI WILL STILL SHARE SOME OF THE GUILT.\n>> AND THE CLINTONS ARE SO DEFENSIVE ABOUT THINGS.\nIT'S THE COVER-UP. IT'S NOT ADMITTING\nRESPONSIBILITY. WHAT SHE SHOULD SAY IS LOOK, I\nDID THIS. IT MAY HAVE BEEN A MISTAKE.\nDID IT COST ANYBODY ANYTHING? WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?\nI THINK THE REASON IT HASN'T CAUGHT FIRE WITH A LOT OF VOTERS\nIS NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO MAKE A CONNECTION BETWEEN HER USE OF\nE-MAIL SERVERS AND SOMEBODY TO ENDANGER TER AMERICAN PEOPLE.\n>> I KNOW WHY SHE DOESN'T DO THIS, BECAUSE THEY WILL THINK OF\nSOMETHING DOECHLTS THEY WILL FIND SOMETHING ELSE.\nIT KEEPS GROWING AT LEAST THE  >> IT IS EVIDENCE OF AN ERROR IN\nJUDGE. .\nIF YOU'RE READY TO BE COMMANDER IN CHIEF IN THE AREA OF NATIONAL\nSECURITY IT WILL NOT GO AWAY. >> AND DID ANYBODY EVER GO TO\nTHE FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE, HILLARY CLINTON AND SAY TO HER,\nYOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO USE THE PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVERS?\nDID ANYONE EVER HAVE SUCH A CONVERSATION?\n>> IF THEY DIDN'T IT'S CERTAINLY A PROBLEM.\n>> IF THEY DIDN'T, HOW COME THAT NEVER HAPPENED?\n>> THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO SUGGESTED IT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN A\nGOOD IDEA. WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ON PAPER\nWHERE THEY ARE LIKE HERE IS A NEW MEMO AND HERE IS THE RULE.\n>> AND AT SOME POINT THERE SHOULD BE SOME INFORMATION\nDELIVERED TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE.\nIF THAT EVER HAPPENED THAT PERSON SHOULD SAY I TOLD HER NOT\nTO DO IT. >> BURIED IN HER 33,000 E-MAILS\nTHERE WAS ONE E-MAIL WHERE A STAFFER SUGGESTED SHE MIGHT WANT\nTO HAVE A STATE DEPARTMENT E-MAIL ADDRESS.\nIT WASN'T SAYING YOU NEED DO THIS.\nIT WAS A SUGGESTION. >> MUCH MORE AHEAD WITH THE\nROUND TABLE.

SHE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO DO GLAD\nHANDING AND SORT OF BUILD RELATIONSHIPS FOR HER CLINTON\nFOUNDATION THROUGH HER ROLE AS SECRETARY OF STATE.\n>> THAT'S THE ONLY REASON SHE WAS MEETING WITH FOREIGN\nLEADERS, YES, I AGREE W. >> OKAY.\nSO EXPLAIN TO ME WHETHER THAT CORRESPONDENCE CATHERINE\nHERRIDGE JUST REFERENCED IS KOSHER WHERE YOU'VE GOT HILLARY\nCLINTON -- LET'S JUST PUT IT ON THE BOARD.\nYOU'VE GOT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION EXECUTIVE DOUG BAND\nWRITING HUMA ABADIN, HER TOP ASSISTANT, AT HUMA'S STATE\nDEPARTMENT E-MAIL ADDRESS REFERRING TO THE CROWN PRINCE OF\nBAHRAIN. CP OF BAHRAIN.\nHE'S SAYING THIS IS THE CLINTON FOUNDATION SAYING TO HILLARY'S\nRIGHT-HAND WOMAN, CROWN PRINCE OF BAHRAIN IN TOMORROW TO\nFRIDAY, ASKING TO SEE HER. GOOD FRIEND OF OURS OVER HERE AT\nTHE CLINTON FOUNDATION. AND SO HE'S BASICALLY TRYING TO\nDO AN END-AROUND BECAUSE HERE'S WHAT HUMA RESPONDS.\nHE ASKED TO SEE HRC THURSDAY AND FRIDAY THROUGH NORMAL CHANNELS.\nSO THIS GUY WENT THROUGH NORMAL CHANNELS, APPARENTLY DIDN'T GET\nTHE ANSWER HE WANTED AND THEN TRIED TO GO TO THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION AND THEY WERE ONLY TOO HAPPY TO HELP.\nTHEN YOU CAN SEE HUMA FIENLTLY RESPONDS OFFERING CROWN PRINCE\n10:00 TOMORROW FOR MEETING. THIS LOOKS SKETCHY, AUSTAN.\nYOU TELL ME. >> LOOK, IF WE'RE NOW GOING TO\nARGUE ABOUT THE SCHEDULING OF MEETING THE CROWN PRINCE OF\nBAHRAIN, WHO THE STATE DEPARTMENT MEETS WITH THE CROWN\nPRINCE OF BAHRAIN. I MEAN THAT IS A THING THAT\nHAPPENS. >> BUT USUALLY THE STATE\nDEPARTMENT ARRANGES IT, AND THEY DIDN'T.\n>> I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT.\nI THINK WE ARE DESCENDING WELL INTO THE TRIVIAL IF WE'RE GOING\nTO START GOING THROUGH THE SCHEDULING AND IF THE\nINSINUATION IS THAT IT'S CONFLICT OF INTEREST, I DON'T\nKNOW WHY WE AREN'T TALKING ABOUT THE DONALD TRUMP TAX PLAN WHERE\nHE PROPOSED LITERALLY A TAX CUT FOR HIS OWN BUSINESSES THAT\nWOULD TOTAL IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.\n>> MARK, THE THING IS THE CROWN PRINCE OF BAHRAIN GAVE\n$32 MILLION. I MEAN THIS GROUP HAD COMMITTED\nA LOT OF MONEY TO THE CLINTON GLOBAL INITIATIVE OVER THE PRIOR\nYEARS. >> TO A CHARITY.\n>> NO. HE WAS A DONOR TO --\n>> HE WAS THE DONOR AND THE KROUNS PRINCE OF BAHRAIN.\n>> HE GAVE $100,000 TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION DIRECTLY AND\nALSO GAVE MONEY TO THE CHARITIES.\nSO BOTH STATEMENTS ARE TRUE. AND THE PROBLEM HERE ISN'T SO\nMUCH THE SCHEDULING OF THE KING OF BAHRAIN.\nTHE PROBLEM IS THE KING OF BAHRAIN WENT THROUGH OFFICIAL\nCHANNELS, DIDN'T GET WHAT HE WANTED, SO THOUGHT, HEY, I'M A\nDONOR TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION. THEY'LL HOOK ME UP, AND THE\nCLINTON STATE DEPARTMENT WAS MORE THAN WILLING TO OBLIGE.\nHERE'S THE PROBLEM. DOUG BAND WAS AN OFFICIAL AT THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION AND ALSO A CONSULTING FIRM CALLED TENEO,\nAND HUMA ABADIN DURING HER TIME AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT WAS AT\nONE TIME AN EMPLOYEE OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT, THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION. >> SIMULTANEOUSLY.\n>> AND DOUG BAND'S CONSULTING FIRM.\nI MEAN IF THAT'S NOT CORRUPTION, I DON'T --\n>> A, SWITCH TO DECAF. LET'S TONE IT DOWN JUST A BIT.\nTHIS IS MOVING INTO THE SAME KIND OF CONSPIRATORIAL THAT NEXT\nWE'RE GOING TO HAVE WHITEWATER. WE'RE GOING TO BE BACK --\n>> THAT'S WHAT CLINTON'S DEFENDER SAY EVERY TIME YOU\nBRING UP -- IT'S A CONSPIRACY. IT'S A CONSPIRACY.\n>> IT IS A -- >> ALL RIGHT.\nI GOT TO GO. SO WE'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT.\nIT'S A CONSPIRACY THEORY, AND THESE ARE TWO GOOD MEN TO WALK\nUS THROUGH IT.",

IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN\nCONSUMERS ARE USING THOSE TAX SAVINGS TO BUY MORE FROM\nRETAILERS. AND ALSO, OF COURSE, RETAILERS\nWILL DO THEIR BEST TO TRY TO ENTICE THAT TRAFFIC TO FLOW\nAROUND THESE TIMES EVEN THOUGH THAT FLUCTUATES AND LOCAL LAWS\nBUT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY WORK. A REPORT FROM THE INSTITUTE ON\nTAXATION AND ECONOMIC POLICY ALSO SUGGESTS THAT IT\nDISPROPORTIONATELY HELPS HIGHER INCOME EARNERS OPPOSED TO\nSHOPPERS LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK.\nHIGHER INCOME EARNERS CHOOSE WHEN THEY MAKE THE PURCHASES,\nWAITING UNTIL THE TAX-FREE HOLIDAYS AND MORE LIKELY TO\nSPEND MORE AND REAPING A BIGGER BENEFIT.\nIF YOU'RE NOT PAYING SALES TAX, THE STATE IS NOT COLLECTING\nSALES TAX. MASSACHUSETTS ACTUALLY DECIDED\nTO DO AWAY WITH ITS TAX-FREE BACK TO SCHOOL SHOPPING SAYING\nIT COST THE STATE NEARLY $26 MILLION LAST YEAR.\nAND THE INSTITUTE FOR TAXATION ECONOMIC POLICY ESTIMATES THAT\nIT COSTS ALL OF THE 17 STATES TOGETHER AROUND $300 MILLION IN\nTAX REVENUE.

APPEARANCES WERE SUPPOSED TO\nCHANGE THAT AND SO FAR THIS SUMMER THAT CHANGE IS NOT\nTERRIBLY MEANING OF. JUST OUT OVER THE PAST WEEKEND\nSHOW THAT TRUMP TOOK IN JUST OVER $2 MILLION FOR THE MONTH SO\nFAR. THE VAST MAJORITY OF IT FROM\nTECHNOLOGIES CO-CHIEF ROBERT MERCER AND A ROUGHLY $75,000\nDONATION OF ROBERT BISHOP BUT SOME OF THE BIG NAMES THAT ARE\nACTING AS TRUMP'S ECONOMIC ADVISERS OF ICAHN AND PAUL SEN\nABSENT FOR THE MONTH OF JULY. AT LEAST SO FAR ACCORDING TO THE\nFILINGS. ICAHN FLOATED AS A POSSIBLE\nTREASURY SECRETARY GIVEN JUST $50,000 IT WOULD APPEAR AND PAUL\nSON ABOUT $250,000. REPORTEDLY.\nBOTH OF THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS IN JUNE, GUYS.\nIN ANY CASE, THEY DIDN'T MOVE THE NEEDLE FAR TOWARDS CLINTONS\nTENS OF MILLIONS. SHE IS REALLY TAKEN IN A LOT\nFROM THAT INDUSTRY. >> SO, INTERESTED, KATE, TO TALK\nABOUT THE DONALD TRUMP DONATIONS OR LACK THEREOF FOR A SECOND.\nYOU KNOW, THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT COULD BE GOING ON\nTHERE. ONE IS THAT PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO\nSUPPORT HIM. YOU KNOW, DON'T WANT TO THROW\nTHEIR WEIGHT BEHIND HIM OR AFRAID OF PEOPLE KNOWING THAT\nTHEY ARE. I MEAN, DO YOU THINK THAT SENSE\nOF HIM BEING A MORE CONTROVERSIAL CANDIDATE THAN THE\nREPUBLICANS LATELY COULD BE HOLDING THEM BACK?\n>> I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY PART OF IT, KELLY.\nI'LL GO A STEP FURTHER. I TALKED TO SOMEBODY LAST WEEK\nWITH AN INTERESTING TAKE ON THE MEDIA AND SOCIAL MEDIA IMPACTED\nTHE RACE. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF MANAGERS\nOUT THERE WHO ALTHOUGH THEY MIGHT BE HOLDING THEIR NOSE\nDOING IT, THEY DON'T AGREE WHOLESALE WITH THE POLICIES,\nSUPPORT HILLARY CLINTON THAN TRUMP AND THINK HE'S A WILD MAN.\nJIM SIMONS SAID, HE IS A HEDGE FUND GUY OF RENAISSANCE AND\nDON'T WANT TO BE PUBLICLY SHAMED AND DON'T WANT DONALD TRUMP\nNORTHWESTING NASTY TWEETS ABOUT THEM AND A MET THE SITUATION.\nI THINK FOR SURE TRUMP'S BEEN CONTROVERSIAL.\nBARONS TALKING ABOUT THE TRADE PACTS THAT HE'S OPPOSED TO AND\nHILLARY CLINTON RAISED ISSUES AND WITH HOW GOOD ECONOMISTS\nCAN'T AGREE WITH THAT. I THINK THAT'S A DIVISIVE ISSUE\nIN HEDGE FUND LAND AND I'M SURE THERE'S MANY OTHERS.\n>> WHAT'S THE INTENT BEHIND THE DOLLARS FROM HEDGE FUNDS TOWARD\nTHE CLINTON AT THIS POINT? OBVIOUSLY, SHE'S HAD PRETTY\nCLOSE TIES WITH FINANCE. BUT IS THERE A POLICY OBJECTIVE\nIT SEEMS TO BE BEHIND OR BACKING THE WINNER?\n>> YOU KNOW, THAT'S HARD TO SAY, MIKE.\nI THINK EVERYBODY HAS THEIR OWN AGENDA.\nYOU THINK, FOR EXAMPLE, ABOUT THE FORMER EXECUTIVE WHO HAS HIS\nOWN PAC AND VERY MUCH DEDICATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AND IS A\nBIG HILLARY SUPPORTER. I THINK IN HIS CASE THERE'S A\nCASE OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND PROBABLY HAS A LARGE PART IN\nDRIVING HIS CONTRIBUTIONS. I THINK OTHER PRIORITIES, RANGE,\nGEORGE SOROS IS A HUGE HILLARY SUPPORTER AND GIVEN AT LEAST $25\nMILLION ACCORDING TO SOMEONE FAMILIAR ARE THE MATTER IN\nVARIOUS WAYS AND HE OBVIOUSLY IS A GUY WHO'S VERY ACTIVE IN\nGLOBAL AFFAIRS, MOST RECENTLY OUTSPOKEN OF BREXIT AND STRONG\nECONOMIC VIEWS, HE'S GOT STRONG HUMAN RIGHTS VIEWS AND THERE'S A\nPAN PLEA OF ISSUES FOR SOMETHING LIKE HIM AND THEN JIM SIMONS,\nRENAISSANCE FOUNDER I MENTIONED, DONALD SUSSMAN, FOUNDER AND\nMANAGER, SO IT'S HARD TO SAY.

IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT\nCONSUMERS BUY MORE BECAUSE OF THE TAX SAVINGS.\nTHOUGH MANY RETAILERS MAY UP THEIR PROMOTIONS IN LINE WITH\nTHE TIMING OF THE HOLIDAYS HOPING TO ENTICE MORE TRAFFIC OR\nTO UP THAT TRANSACTION SIZE. REPORT FROM THE INSTITUTE OF\nTAXATION AND ECONOMIC POLICY SAYS THE TAX FREE HOLIDAYS\nDISPROPORTIONATELY HELP THOSE WITH HIGHER INCOMES, THOSE WHO\nCAN CHOOSE TO WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO BUY FOR BACK TO SCHOOL IF\nTHEY'RE NOT LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK, AND ALSO BECAUSE THEY\nTYPICALLY SPEND MORE, THE TAX FREE HOLIDAY CAN BENEFIT THEM\nMORE.

I WANT TO BRING IN DREW, STAFF\nWRITER AT THE \"WASHINGTON POST,\" AND ANDRE BOWER, FORMER\nLIEUTENANT GOVERNOR OF SOUTH CAROLINA WHO'S SUPPORTING TRUMP.\nI WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO HILLARY CLINTON LAST WEEKEND IN\nCLEVELAND. >> WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TAX RATE\nHE PAYS BECAUSE UNLIKE EVERYBODY ELSE WHO'S RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN\nTHE LAST FOUR OR FIVE DECADES, HE REFUSES TO RELEASE HIS TAX\nRETURNS SO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN'T REALLY JUDGE.\n>> SO DREW, HILLARY CLINTON IS TALKING ABOUT WHAT YOU CALL THE\nMYSTERY SURROUNDING TRUMP'S PERSONAL FINANCES.\nWHAT ARE SOME OF THOSE MYSTERIES?\n>> WELL, THE TAX RETURNS GIVE US A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS RIGHT\nTHERE. WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY HE\nMAKES EVERY YEAR, DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY HE PAYS IN TAXES\nEVERY YEAR. HE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY HE\nGIVES IN CHARITY EVERY YEAR OR HOW MUCH HE KEEPS IN FOREIGN\nACCOUNTS. ALL OF THIS IS INFORMATION THAT\nWOULD BE IN THE FIRST THREE PAGES OF HIS TAX RETURNS, BUT WE\nHAVEN'T SEEN THOSE IN A LONG TIME, AND FROM WHAT WE DO KNOW\nABOUT HIS TAX RETURNS, HE HAS SPENT SEVERAL YEARS NOT PAYING\nTAXES, AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF QUESTIONS FROM HIS PERSONAL\nFINANCIAL DISCLOSURES FROM -- BIG QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS DEBTS\nOVER THE SIZE OF HIS EMPIRE, THE SIZE OF HIS DEBTS, WHAT HE\nACTUALLY OWNS AND HOW SUCCESSFUL OF A BUSINESSMAN HE IS.\nWAY MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS WE HAVE.\n>> YEAH, YOU HAVE A NEW REPORT ABOUT TRUMP'S GOLF COURSES AND\nYOU DETAIL HOW TRUMP'S CLAIMS ONE VALUE TO IMPRESS VOTERS,\nRIGHT, THEN ANOTHER TO DETERMINE TAX VALUE.\nWHAT'S THE STORY THERE? >> YEAH, SO IF YOU'RE A\nHOMEOWNER, YOU KNOW ABOUT DISPUTING YOUR TAXES AND YOU\nKNOW ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT YOU'RE TAXED ON FOR\nYOUR HOUSE AND WHAT YOU CAN SELL IT FOR.\nTRUMP SORT OF DOES A LITTLE SPIN ON THAT IN THAT HE VALUES HIS\nGOLF COURSES AT A VERY HIGH NUMBER IN HIS ELECTION REGULATOR\nFILINGS SAYING COURSES ARE THE BIGGEST AND THE BEST AND THEY'RE\nWORTH MORE THAN $50 MILLION. WHILE ALSO SAYING TO THE SAME\nCOUNTIES AND TOWNS AND CITIES THAT TAX THOSE AND DEPEND ON\nTHAT TAX REVENUE THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY WORTH FAR LESS, THAT\nTHEY SHOULD BE TAXED AS IF THEY WERE WORTH $5 MILLION OR $1\nMILLION OR $10 MILLION. THERE'S A HUGE DISCREPANCY THERE\nAND THE NUMBERS SHOULD BE A LITTLE CLOSER THAN YOU WOULD\nNECESSARILY SEE IF IT WAS A DIFFERENT BUSINESS.\nWHY THE DIFFERENCE HERE? IT'S LIKELY BECAUSE TRUMP SEES\nVALUE IN HAVING THE PROPERTIES LOOK AS GRANDIOSE AND AS\nLUXURIOUS AS POSSIBLE IN ONE VENUE WHILE SAVING A LOT OF TAX\nMONEY ON THE OTHER. >> SO, ANDRE, THE QUESTION IS,\nIS THIS JUST BUSINESS AS USUAL? BIG BUSINESSES HAVE HIGHLY PAID\nLAWYERS. THEY'VE GOT PEOPLE, ACCOUNTANTS\nTO GET THE BEST DEALS POSSIBLE FOR THEIR CLIENTS.\nDOES THAT SIT WELL, YOU THINK, WITH SUPPORTERS WHO CAN'T, YOU\nKNOW, GET THOSE KINDS OF BREAKS, THEMSELVES?\n>> WELL, I THINK IT'S HARD TO DIGEST, QUITE FRANKLY, WHAT BIG\nBUSINESS DOES. I KNOW THAT THERE'S A LITTLE BIT\nOF A RUB WITH THE FACT THAT, YOU KNOW, FOLKS THAT MAKE A LOT OF\nMONEY DON'T PAY, SOMETIMES, NEAR AS MUCH BECAUSE OF TAX\nADVANTAGES, AND TRUMP HAS SAID, QUITE FRANKLY, YOU KNOW, WE NEED\nTO CHANGE THE TAX STRUCTURE. I'LL TELL YOU AN INTERESTING\nTIDBIT, DON. A GUY NAMED BRAD THOMAS, A\nFORMER REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER, WROTE A BOOK ON TRUMP.\nIT CAME OUT LAST WEEK. IT'S CALLED \"THE TRUMP FACTOR.\"\nI'M ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH IT NOW.\nHE BASICALLY TOOK THE LAST THREE YEARS, WENT TO EACH PROPERTY,\nANALYZED THE BOOKS. HE SAID TRUMP'S DEBT TO INCOME\nIS VERY LOW. HIS DEBT IS A LITTLE OVER $600\nMILLION. HE SAYS HIS VALUE IS GETTING\nCLOSE TO $10 MILLION. NOT QUITE AT 10 MILLION DOLLARS.\nHE TAKES THINGS AND BREAKS DOWN THE OLD POST OFFICE ON\nPENNSYLVANIA AVENUE, ASSESS VALUE OF $400 MILLION.\nTAKES HIS FIRST PROPERTY HE BOUGHT FOR LESS THAN $1 MILLION,\nGE FINANCED IT AND WHEN HE WALKED AWAY, HE MADE\n$142 MILLION ON IT. THAT WAS THE OLD COMMODORE HOTEL\nTHAT WAS TRANSFERRED INTO THE GRAND HYATT.\nIT'S AN INTERESTING BOOK AND GIVING ME A LOT BETTER INSIGHT\nINTO SOME OF THE TRUMP PROPERTY. >> WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT, TO\nSEE HOW -- >> WELL, YOU KNOW, THERE HAVE\nBEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT SAID HE'S ONLY WORTH A COUPLE MILLION\nDOLLARS. \"FORBES\" SAYS HE'S WORTH $4.5\nBILLION. THIS BOOK SAYS HE'S WORTH ALMOST\n$10 BILLION. JUST SAY \"FORBES\" IS RIGHT, HE'S\nSTILL WORTH ALMOST $5 BILLION, AND IT'S BEEN ARGUED THAT HE'S\nONLY WORTH A COUPLE HUNDRED MILLION.\n>> I WANT YOU GUYS TO LISTEN. THIS IS DONALD TRUMP ABOUT HIS\nTAX RETURN AND WE'LL DISCUSS. >> WHY NOT JUST GET THEM OUT\nTHERE? >> WELL BECAUSE MY RETURNS ARE\nEXTREMELY COMPLEX. I'LL MAKE A DETERMINATION AT THE\nRIGHT TIME. I'M IN NO RUSH TO DO IT.\n>> I WILL ABSOLUTELY GIVE MY RETURNS BUT I'M BEING AUDITED\nNOW FOR TWO, THREE YEARS SO I CAN'T DO IT UNTIL THE AUDIT IS\nFINISHED. >> EVERY TIME SOMEONE RAISED THE\nQUESTIONS OF HIS TAXES, HE EVADES AND YOU DON'T DO THAT IF\nYOU ARE PLANNING ON RELEASING THEM.\n>> I HAVE VERY BIG TAX RETURNS. I'M SURE YOU'RE SEEN THE\nPICTURES WITH THE RETURNS LITERALLY FROM THE FLOOR UP TO\nHERE. EXTREMELY COMPLEX.\n>> DO YOU THINK YOU CAN DO IT BEFORE THE ELECTION?\n>> I HOPE SO. I'D LIKE TO.\nI HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH RELEASING TAX RETURNS.\n>> DO YOU PLEDGE TO DO IT BEFORE THE ELECTION?\n>> EXCUSE ME. SURE.\nIF AUDIT IS FINISHED. I'LL DO IT AS FAST AS THE\nAUDIT'S FINISHED. >> EVEN HIS NEW CAMPAIGN MANAGER\nKELLYANNE CONWAY ON CNN SAID BEFORE SHE WAS HIS CAMPAIGN\nMANAGER, SHE WAS WITH TED CRUZ, SHE SAID HE SHOULD RELEASE HIS\nTAX RETURNS. SO DREW, WHAT IS THE EXPLANATION\nIN YOUR OPINION, IS THERE A BOMBSHELL?\n>> WE CAN'T REALLY KNOW. I MEAN, THE EXCUSES MR. TRUMP\nHAS GIVEN SO FAR DON'T STAND UP TO SCRUTINY.\nHE BLAMES THE AUDITS AND YET THERE IS NOTHING THAT THE IRS\nSAYS SHOULD PREVENT SOMEBODY FROM RELEASING YOUR TAX RETURNS\nIF YOU'RE UNDER AUDIT. RICHARD NIXON RELEASED TAX\nRETURNS WHILE HE WAS UNDER AUDIT.\nEVERY MAJOR CANDIDATE OVER THE LAST 40 YEARS HAS RELEASED THEIR\nTAX RETURNS. IF MR. TRUMP IS PROUD OF HIS\nBUSINESS SUCCESS, PROUD OF HIS WEALTH, THERE'S NOTHING TO\nPREVENT HIM SHARING THESE TAX RETURNS ON A PUBLIC BASE AS HE'S\nCALLED FOR OTHER REPUBLICANS TO DO FOR MANY YEARS.\nSO WHAT'S HIDING IN THERE? I DON'T REALLY KNOW.\nTRUMP TALKS ABOUT HOW COMPLICATED THE RETURNS ARE AND\nI'M SURE THEY ARE COMPLICATED, BUT THE FIRST THREE PAGES WOULD\nTELL YOU EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT INFORMATION THAT WE\nNEED TO KNOW ABOUT A COMMANDER IN CHIEF OR A TAX COLLECTOR IN\nCHIEF, STUFF LIKE HIS INCOME, STUFF LIKE HOW MUCH HE GIVES TO\nCHARITY OR HOW LITTLE HE GIVES TO CHARITY.\nSTUFF LIKE HOW MUCH HE HAS IN FOREIGN ACCOUNTS INCLUDING IN\nPLACES LIKE RUSSIA. STUFF LIKE WHAT HE FILES HIS\nBUSINESS EXPENSES. HE COULD FILE COSMETICS OR HIS\nHAIR OR PLANE AS BUSINESS EXPENSES.\nSO, YOU KNOW, ALL OF THESE ARE IMPORTANT TO KNOW ABOUT SOMEONE\nWHO CLAIMS TO BE A SUCCESSFUL, YOU KNOW, EMPIRE OWNER, A\nSUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN AND MONEYMAN, AND EXTRAORDINARILY\nIMPORTANT TO KNOW IF IT'S GOING TO BE SOMEBODY LEADING THE\nCOUNTRY. >> HE WAS VERY VEHEMENT IN THE\nLAST ELECTION CYCLE, ANDRE, SAYING MITT ROMNEY SHOULD\nRELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS. MITT ROMNEY'S COMMENTS NOW, YOU\nHEARD HE'S HIDING SOMETHING. DO YOU THINK HE'S HIDING\nSOMETHING? >> I DON'T THINK HE IS BUT I\nDON'T KNOW. I THOUGHT GOVERNOR SANFORD GAVE\nA GREAT COMPELLING ARGUMENT EARLIER WHEN YOU HAD HIM ON THE\nSHOW. EVEN BRAD DOES AS WELL.\nI'M INTRIGUED AS A LOT OF FOLKS ARE.\nI DON'T KNOW THE NUANCES -- >> THE GOVERNOR SAID IT WOULD BE\nBETTER IF HE WANTS TO BE A PROPONENT OF TRANSPARENCY, HE\nSHOULD RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS IF HE'S TRYING TO GET HILLARY\nCLINTON TO RELEASE OTHER THINGS LIKE SPEECHES AND TRANSCRIPTS\nAND ALL OF THAT. SO HE ACTUALLY -- HE'S SAYING\nHE'S GOING TO VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nYOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE CONGRESSMAN, SANFORD, BUT HE\nSAYS DONALD TRUMP SHOULD RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS.\nDO YOU THINK AS A SUPPORTER HE SHOULD RELEASE THEM?\n>> I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM RELEASED.\n>> THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN.",

THE ADAGE IS SKILL GETS TOUT\nOLYMPIC GAMES BUT WILL MAKES YOU A CHAMPION.\nAND THAT'S VERY CLEAR THAT AMERICAN ATHLETES HAVE THE\nWILL, THE DISCIPLINE, AND THE SKILL TO DOMINATE THE\nSPORTING WORLD. THE BEST IMAGE FOR ME WAS\nTHE SITE OF THE AMERICAN BASKETBALL TEAM CARRYING OUR\nFLAGS AFTER WINNING THE GOLD MEDAL.\nTHE TEAM WAS ALL MINORITY, PLAYERS SHOWING PRIDE IN\nTHEIR COUNTRY. WHEN THE NATIONAL ANTHEM WAS\nPLAYED, THE GUYS HAD THEIR HANDS ON THEIR HEARTS, NO\nCHEAP SHOTS AT THE COUNTRY THAT HAD AFFORDED THEM THE\nOPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL.\nSO, TO ME, THE SPIRIT OF AMERICA IS INTACT, DESPITE\nTHE FACT, DESPITE THE FACT THAT ZEALOTS AND LOONS ON\nBOTH POLITICAL SPECTRUMS TRYING TO TEAR THE U.S.A.\nDOWN.

I AGREE WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT\nTHE LIES THE LEFT HAS TOLD ABOUT AMERICA BUT I'M NOT\nQUITE SURE HOW I SEE ONE IS CONNECTED WITH THE OTHER.\nLOOK, THE REASON WE DOMINATE THE MEDAL IS BECAUSE WE ARE,\nI THINK, THE THIRD MOST POPULIST NATION ON EARTH.\nWE ARE NOT THE CHIEF MEDAL WINNER ON PER CAPITA BASIS.\nTHERE ARE A LOT OF MEASURES.

WE, IN AMERICA HAVE THE WILL\nTO ACHIEVE IN GREATER PROPORTION THAN ALL THE\nOTHER COUNTRIES.

IT WAS A BIPARTISAN BILL.\nNEWT GINGRICH WAS BEHIND THAT ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE AND IT WAS A\nFABULOUS SUCCESS. WE SAW THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON\nWELFARE DROP BY 70%.

BUT THAT'S WHAT THE JOBS CREATED\nIN THIS COUNTRY HAVE BEEN. >> ACTUALLY A LOT OF JOBS BEING\nCREATED IF YOU'RE A CARPENTER ELECTRICIAN OR YOU KNOW HOW TO\nDRIVE A TRUCK, WE NEED WORKERS WITH SKILLS, NOT NECESSARILY A\nPSYCHOLOGY DEGREE OR A SOCIALOLOGY DEGREE BUT I WANT TO\nGO BACK TO THIS ISSUE OF WELFARE REFORM BECAUSE WE HAVE MORE\nPEOPLE ON WELFARE NOW THAN WE'VE EVER HAD IN OUR COUNTRY.\nWHY IS THAT?

IF YOU WANT MORE OF THAT, VOTE\nFOR HILLARY CLINTON. IF YOU WANT AN ELEMENT OF\nCHANGE, YOU WANT TO SHAKE THINGS UP, YOU WANT A GOVERNMENT THAT'S\nACCOUNTABLE TO THE PEOPLE, DONALD TRUMP OFFERS THAT\nALTERNATIVE. >> AS FOR DONALD TRUMP, WE'RE\n GOING TO WORK MORE CLOSELY WITH HIS\nCAMPAIGN. TELL US ABOUT THAT ROLE.\n>> IT'S NOT THAT UNIQUE. WE'VE HAD AN INSTANCE OF THIS IN\n2012 WITH ROMNEY AND BEFORE WITH McCAIN.\nAS WE HEAD INTO THE FINAL STRETCH, MORE AND MORE OF THE\nRNC TEAM INTEGRATES WITH THEIR TEAM.\nWE'VE HAD FOLKS IN THE DIGITAL OPERATION WORKING HAND IN HAND\nWITH THEIR TEAM. OUR FINANCE TEAM IS FULLY\nINTEGRATED. I'LL SPEND MORE TIME WITH\nMEMBERS OF MY TEAM UP HERE INTEGRATING, TALKING ABOUT\nMESSAGING. >> HE GOT A LOT OF CREDIT LAST\nWEEK FOR HAVING VERY DISCIPLINED POLICY SPEECHES AND HE HAD A\nGOOD WEEK BECAUSE OF THAT. ARE YOU HERE TO MAKE SURE HE\nBEHAVES? >> NO.\nWHAT I'M HERE TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT UP AND DOWN THE TICKET,\nTHAT WE HAVE A CONTRAST AND THAT HE WINS.\nWHAT'S MADE DONALD TRUMP SUCCESSFUL, WHAT HELPED HIM IN\nTHE PRIMARY, WAS THE FACT THAT HE IS AUTHENTIC.\nHE DOESN'T TALK IN POLITICALLY CORRECT TERMS.\nHE CHANNELS THE FRUSTRATION AND ANGER OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\nWHEN IT COMES TO A GOVERNMENT THAT'S UNRESPONSIVE AND PEOPLE\nBEING TOLD THAT YOU SHOULD BE SATISFIED WITH WAGES THAT ARE\nINCREASING AND AN ECONOMY THAT'S STAGNANT.\nALL WE'RE HERE TO DO IS MAKE SURE THE ENTIRE TEAM BENEFITS.\nWE MAINTAIN OUR MAJORITIES IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE AND THAT WE\nTAKE BACK THE WHITE HOUSE. >> THERE'S WORD THAT TRUMP MAY\nSOFTEN HIS TOUGH STANCE ON IMMIGRATION.\nHERE IS WHAT HIS NEW CAMPAIGN MANAGER SAID OVER THE WEEKEND\nABOUT WHETHER TRUMP'S PLANS WILL INCLUDE A DEPORTATION TASK\nFORCE. >> AS THE WEEKS UNFOLD, HE WILL\nLAY OUT THE SPECIFICS OF THAT PLAN THAT HE WOULD IMPLEMENT AS\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. >> WILL THAT PLAN INCLUDE A\nDEPORTATION FORCE, THE KIND THAT YOU JUST HEARD IN THAT SOUND\nBITE AND THAT HE TALKED ABOUT DURING THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES?\n>> TO BE DETERMINED. >> THIS IS ALL OVER THE PLACE,\nBECAUSE WE HEAR THESE RUMORS COMING OUT OF THE FRIDAY MEETING\nWITH THE HISPANIC ADVISORY COUNCIL SAYING WE MAY BE\nSOFTENING THIS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE ILLEGALLY, THEN WE HAVE\nTHE TALK OF A DEPORTATION TASK FORCE WHICH SOUNDS PRETTY HEAVY\nHANDED. WHERE IS HE?\n>> HE'S WHERE HE WAS BEFORE AND WHERE HE IS TODAY.\nHE CALLED INTO FOX THIS MORNING AND REITERATED THAT HE'S GOING\nTO BE FIRM, FAIR, AND HUMANE. HE UNDERSTANDS THAT FAMILIES ARE\nHERE, HAVE BEEN HERE FOR A WHILE, THE IMPACT IT HAS ON THE\nECONOMY. HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE WE, ONE,\nARE A NATION OF RULES AND LAWS BUT ALSO THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT\nTHE COMPLEXITY OF HAVING FAMILIES IN THIS SITUATION AND\nTHE IMPACT THE ECONOMY. AS KELLYANNE PUT FORWARD\nCORRECTLY, HE'S GOING TO BE ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES,\nCONTINUING TO GIVE US POLICY STATEMENTS AND FULLY ADDRESS THE\nIMPACT, THE PLAN THAT HE HAS FOR MAINTAINING AND GROWING AND\nFIXING LEGAL IMMIGRATION IN THIS COUNTRY.\n>> NORMALLY YOU AND I SEE EACH OTHER IN WASHINGTON, IT'S GOOD\nTO SEE YOU IN NEW YORK, SOUNDS LIKE YOU'LL BE HERE FOR QUITE A\nBIT.",

GREAT BRITAIN 67, RUSSIA 56,\nGERMANY AND FRANCE BOTH HAD 42 THE GAMES PROVING THAT\nTHIS COUNTRY REMAINS A SUPER POWER NOT ONLY IN MILITARY\nMATTERS BUT ALSO IN ATHLETICS.\nLOOK, A POOL IS A POOL. A TRACK IS A TRACK.\nIT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH MONEY A COUNTRY HAS.\nIT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE SOCIAL SYSTEM IS.\nKENYA, FOR EXAMPLE, DOMINATES LONG DISTANCE\nRUNNING AND THAT'S A VERY POOR PLACE.\nTHE ADAGE IS SKILL GETS TOUT OLYMPIC GAMES BUT WILL MAKES\nYOU A CHAMPION.

THE TEAM WAS ALL MINORITY,\nPLAYERS SHOWING PRIDE IN THEIR COUNTRY.\nWHEN THE NATIONAL ANTHEM WAS PLAYED, THE GUYS HAD THEIR\nHANDS ON THEIR HEARTS, NO CHEAP SHOTS AT THE COUNTRY\nTHAT HAD AFFORDED THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED AT\nTHE HIGHEST LEVEL. SO, TO ME, THE SPIRIT OF\nAMERICA IS INTACT, DESPITE THE FACT, DESPITE THE FACT\nTHAT ZEALOTS AND LOONS ON BOTH POLITICAL SPECTRUMS\nTRYING TO TEAR THE U.S.A. DOWN.\nIF YOU BELIEVE THE FAR LEFT WE ARE A BIGOTED COUNTRY\nTHAT ACTIVELY SEEKS TO DESTROY YOUNG BLACK MEN.\nTHE CRAZY LEFT ALSO PUTS OUT THAT WE WANT TO PERSECUTE\nINNOCENT IMMIGRANTS THAT OUR ECONOMIC SYSTEM IS RIGGED TO\nHELP THE WEALTHY.

THESE ARE HATEFUL PEOPLE WHO\nDESERVE ALL THE SCORN THEY GET.\nREMEMBER, THE MEDIA WILL VICIOUSLY ATTACK NIP ON THE\nFAR RIGHT WHO OFFENDS THEM WHILE MANY FAR LEFT PEOPLE\nLIKE GEORGE SOROS GET A COMPLETE PASS THAT'S WHY THE\nTRUE IMAGE OF THE U.S.A. IS NOT PORTRAYED THROUGHOUT THE\nWORLD WHILE RANK PROPAGANDA OFTEN IS.\nHOWEVER, THE TRUTH WAS PUT FORTH BY OUR OLYMPIC\nATHLETES WHO PERFORMED MAGNIFICENTLY AND ONCE AGAIN\nPROVED THAT AMERICA IS A PLACE OF TREMENDOUS\nACHIEVEMENT. YES, THE SWIMMER RYAN LOCHTE\nAND HIS FRIENDS DISPLAYED NARCISSISM AND DECEIT.\nBUT, OTHER THAN THAT, OUR ATHLETES REPRESENTED AMERICA\nIN A VERY POSITIVE WAY. WE ARE, INDEED, A COUNTRY OF\nACHIEVEMENT, OPPORTUNITY, AND SUCCESS.\nIF YOU WORK HARD, AND YOU WORK SMART, AND YOU ARE\nHONEST, YOU CAN MAKE IT HERE.\nNO MATTER WHO YOU ARE. AND THAT'S THE MEMO.\nNOW FOR THE TOP STORY, REACTION, JOINING US FOR\nREACTION CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER.\nAND YOU SAY? >> WELL, I AGREE WHAT YOU\nSAID ABOUT THE OLYMPIC SPIRIT.\nI AGREE WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THE LIES THE LEFT HAS TOLD\nABOUT AMERICA BUT I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW I SEE ONE IS\nCONNECTED WITH THE OTHER. LOOK, THE REASON WE DOMINATE\nTHE MEDAL IS BECAUSE WE ARE, I THINK, THE THIRD MOST\nPOPULIST NATION ON EARTH. WE ARE NOT THE CHIEF MEDAL\nWINNER ON PER CAPITA BASIS. THERE ARE A LOT OF MEASURES.\nWE HAVE A GREAT SPORTING SPIRIT.\nWE HAVE A GREAT SPORTING HISTORY.\nWE HAVE A LOT OF GREAT ATHLETES AND AS THE BEN\nLOTTENBERG ONCE WROTE WE'RE THE ONLY UNIVERSAL NATION ON\nEARTH, MEANING WE ARE COMPOSED UNIQUELY, UNLIKE\nANY OTHER COUNTRY ON EARTH OF PEOPLE FROM EVERY REGION,\nEVERY RELIGION, EVERY RACE, AND THEY ARE ALL HERE AND\nEACH HAS THEIR OWN SPECIALTIES AND ALL THEIR\nEDGES LENS. I THRILL OF THE AMERICANS\nWHO WIN. I THRILL ALSO AT THE KENYAN\nWHO WON THE MARATHON. I MEAN, THE IDEA THAT THERE\nIS SOMETHING DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE AMERICAN SPIRIT\nAND THE SPIRIT OF THE GUY WHO WON THE MARATHON,\nEXPLAIN IT TO ME. >> I WILL.\nWE, IN AMERICA HAVE THE WILL TO ACHIEVE IN GREATER\nPROPORTION THAN ALL THE OTHER COUNTRIES.\nTHAT WAS PROVEN IN THE BATTLEFIELD IN GLIEWRP WORLD\nWAR II AND BATTLEFIELD PACIFIC IN WORLD WAR II\nWHERE WE HAVE AN WISHED THE EVIL DOERS.\nOUR WILL. THAT SAME SPIRIT I SAW IN\nTHE OLYMPICS. NOT THAT WE'RE ANY BETTER AS\nPEOPLE IT'S THAT OUR CULTURE IS ONE OF ACHIEVEMENT AND\nTHAT IS STILL HERE DESPITE THE BERNIE SANDERS,\nEVERYTHING IS RIGGED, DESPITE THE MEDIA WHO HATES\nTHE COUNTRY BECAUSE WE'RE NOT SOCIALISTS.\nDESPITE THE RACIAL HUSTLERS WHO PUT US DOWN EVERY TIME\nTHEY CAN. THE WILL OF ACHIEVEMENT IS\nSTILL HERE. THAT'S MY CASE.\nLAST WORD? >> OF COURSE IT'S STILL\nHERE. THE WILL OF ACHIEVEMENT IS\nALSO IN THAT KENYON. THE WILL OF ACHIEVEMENT WAS\nALSO WITH THE BRITISH ARMY WHEN IT FOUGHT WITH US IN\nEUROPE AND IN THE PACIFIC AND WON THE WAR.\nTHE IDEA THAT WE ARE UNIQUE IN HAVING WILL.\nWE ARE UNIQUE IN HAVING A WONDERFUL SPORTING SPIRIT\nAND HISTORY AND TRAINING. AND I WOULD ADD ONE MORE\nTHING WHICH IS INTERESTING. WE'RE THE ONLY MAJOR\nSPORTING NATION THAT DOES NOT HAVE A MINISTRY OF\nSPORTS. IT'S ALL DONE BY THE\nVOLUNTEERING. BY DONATION.\nAND BY PEOPLE AND KIDS WHO GROW UP AND WANT TO BE\nEXCELLENT. >> THAT'S RIGHT.\nTHEY WANT TO BE EXCELLENT. IT'S NOT LIKE IF YOU ARE\nCHINESE AND YOU ARE 9 YEARS OLD AND THEY PICK YOU OUT OF\nA CLASS AND THEY MAKE YOU DO IT FOR 10 YEARS.\nHERE, IT IS AN EXPRESSION OF THE SPIRIT OF EXCELLENCE\nTHAT'S OKAY. LET'S NOT GET A LITTLE TOO\nCHAUVINISTIC OUT HERE. ON A PER CAPITA BASIS WE\nWERE NOT THE TOP. >> THROUGHOUT THE WORLD WE\nARE THE TOP. WE ARE THE TOP NATION TO\nPROTECT OTHER NATIONS, THE TOP ECONOMY AND THE TOP\nWINNER OF THE OLYMPIC MEDALS.\n>> I'M NOT DENYING ANY OF THAT.\n>> WE DON'T HAVE QUITE THE DETAUNT.\nHERE. BUT IT'S TWO PROVOCATIVE\nPOINTS OF VIEW. >> YOU ARE TRYING TO INVENT\nTHE SEGUE WAY. AND I'M TRYING TO SHOW YOU\nTHAT IT DOESN'T REALLY EXIST.\nBUT IT WAS A WONDERFUL TRY. >> WHAT I WANTED TO DO WAS\nOVERWHELM YOU WITH MY COMMON SENSE AS I ALWAYS DO.\nYOU ARE A LITTLE RESISTANT TO IT.\nTHAT'S ALL RIGHT. THAT'S WHY EVERYBODY LOVES\nUS. CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER,\nEVERYBODY. NEXT ON THE RUN DOWN.\nDONALD TRUMP WILL BE HERE TO TALK ABOUT WHETHER HE IS\nCHANGING HIS IMMIGRATION VISION.\nAND LATER ON, MILLER AND WATTERS BACK TO BACK\nUPCOMING.",
