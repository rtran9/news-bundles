WHAT IS BEST FOR YOUR FAMILY?\nTHAT'S HOW THESE DECISIONS NEED TO BE MADE.\n>> I WOULDN'T SAY THE TONE IS EXACTLY A SHINING CITY ON THE\nHILL TONE FROM TRUMP RIGHT NOW, BUT BRIAN, I DIGRESS.\nLET ME TALK TO YOU. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THIS PITCH\nTHAT WE HEARD FROM DONALD TRUMP LAST NIGHT, SAYING WHAT THE HELL\nDO YOU HAVE TO LOSE, DO YOU THINK, THOUGH, THAT'S THE MOST\nEFFECTIVE PLAY THAT HE CAN MAKE FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS?\nOR IS IT TALKING DOWN TO A BLOCK OF VOTERS?\n>> WELL, LOOK, THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT A REPUBLICAN HAS\nTRIED TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY CAN DO -- THE REPUBLICAN PARTY CAN\nDO A LITTLE BETTER AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS.\nDONALD TRUMP IS NOT ENTERING THIS DEBATE FOR THE FIRST TIME.\nREPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN STRATEGISTS HAVE BEEN TALKING\nABOUT THIS AND THE PARTY HAS BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS FOR A\nVERY LONG TIME. AND YOU KNOW, YOU TALK TO MOST\nREPUBLICAN STRATEGISTS AND THEY HAVE SOME IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO\nAPPROACH THIS COMMUNITY, WHICH OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVEN'T DONE SO\nWELL WITH IN RECENT YEARS. AND MOST OF THOSE STRATEGISTS\nWOULD NOT RECOMMEND THE WAY THAT DONALD TRUMP DID THIS.\nFOR ONE, THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING\nTO ANY AUDIENCE IS GO TO THEIR LEADERSHIP, GO TO THE POLICY\nPROFESSIONALS AND SAY WHAT IS IT THAT YOUR COMMUNITY CARES ABOUT\nAND HOW CAN WE FIND SOME COMMON GROUND.\nTWO, YOU MIGHT WANT TO GO AND SPEAK BEFORE AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nAUDIENCE IF YOU'RE APPEALING FOR THEIR VOTES.\nHIS SPEECHES RECENTLY ARE BEFORE OVERWHELMINGLY WHITE AUDIENCES.\nTHOSE ARE TWO THINGS THAT SURPRISE ME.\nTHE THIRD THING IS, HE HAS A VERY, VERY SIMPLISTIC VIEW ABOUT\nHOW AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE LIVING IN THE UNITED STATES.\nHE SEEMS TO THINK THAT ALL AFRICAN-AMERICANS BASED ON THAT\nQUOTE THAT YOU PLAYED ARE POOR, LIVING IN CRIME-RIDDEN AREAS,\nUNEMPLOYED, AND THAT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT TRUE.\nTHERE ARE UNIQUE PROBLEMS IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, BUT\nHE'S JUST GOT THE TONE AND A LITTLE BIT OFF I WOULD SAY.\n>> HOLLY, AS A CLINTON SUPPORTER, I WANT YOU TO LISTEN\nTO THIS. >> THE INNER CITIES OF OUR\nCOUNTRY HAVE BEEN RUN BY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY FOR MORE THAN\n50 YEARS. THEIR POLICIES HAVE PRODUCED\nONLY POVERTY, JOBLESSNESS, FAILING SCHOOLS, AND BROKEN\nHOMES. IT'S TIME TO HOLD DEMOCRATIC\nPOLITICIANS ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO THESE\nCOMMUNITIES. AT WHAT POINT DO WE SAY ENOUGH?\n>> SO, AS A DEMOCRAT, AS THE CLINTON SUPPORTER, HOLLY, TO\nTHAT, DOES HE HAVE A POINT? DO YOU THINK YOUR PARTY HAS DONE\nENOUGH FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS STRUGGLING IN THIS COUNTRY?\n>> WHEN HE ASKED WHAT PEOPLE COULD LOSE BY VOTING FOR HIM,\nIT'S EXACTLY THE WRONG QUESTION. WHAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR IS\nSOLUTIONS TO THEIR PROBLEMS. AND DONALD TRUMP SIMPLY DOESN'T\nHAVE ANY. >> SO MY QUESTION TO YOU WAS\nABOUT YOUR CANDIDATE AND YOUR PARTY.\nHAVE THEY DONE ENOUGH? >> OF COURSE.\nTHERE'S OBVIOUSLY MORE WORK TO DO IN THIS COUNTRY, BUT WE HAVE\nSUPPORTED AND PUT INTO PLACE POLICIES THE HAVE HELPED RAISE\nTHE MINIMUM WAGE IN THIS COUNTRY, WHO HAVE HELPED PUT\nPAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAMS LIKE IN PHILADELPHIA THAT WE'RE\nSEEING THAT WILL HELP ALL COMMUNITIES INCLUDING\nCOMMUNITIES OF COLOR. >> DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO RAISE\nTHE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE TO $10. >> DEPENDS ON WHICH DAY YOU ASK\nHIM THAT QUESTION BECAUSE SOME DAYS HE OPPOSES THEM ALL\nTOGETHER. I DON'T TRUST HIS OPINION THERE,\nBUT ALSO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HAVE VOTED MULTIPLE TIMES IN THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY TO OPPOSE RAISES OF THE MINIMUM WAGE.\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT EQUAL PAY, WHERE THE DEMOCRATS HAVE\nSUPPORTED EQUAL PAY LAWS TO IMPROVE THE PAY GAP, WHICH IS A\nPROBLEM THAT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR EVEN HAVE A WIDER GAP.\nAND SO I THINK THAT WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT SOLUTIONS, WHEN\nYOU'RE ASKING WHAT ARE THE SOLUTIONS?\nDONALD TRUMP CAN TALK UNTIL HE'S BLUE IN THE FACE ABOUT REACHING\nOUT TO COMMUNITIES OF COLOR, BUT UNTIL HE HAS ACTUAL POLICIES\nTHAT ARE GOING TO HELP, I'M REALLY NOT SURE IT'S GOING TO\nHELP HIS CAMPAIGN. >> AMY, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE\nOPTICS OF LAST NIGHT. HE GAVE THIS SPEECH IN\nDIAMONDDALE MICHIGAN, WHICH IS RIGHT OUTSIDE LANCING.\nIT IS 93% WHITE, ACCORDING TO CENSUS.\nOUR PRODUCERS WHO WERE THERE SAID THE AUDIENCE WAS ALMOST ALL\nWHITE. HE COULD HAVE GONE TO DETROIT,\nCOULD HAVE GONE TO LANCING FIVE MINUTES DOWN THE ROAD, MUCH MORE\nDIVERSE. NOT THE FIRST TIME HE DID THAT\nTHIS WEEK. ALSO WHEN HE SPOKE IN NEW\nHAMPSHIRE, HE SPOKE IN A CITY THAT IS LESS THAN 1% BLACK.\nWHY DOES HE KEEP DOING THIS? AND DO YOU THINK HE SHOULD\nCHANGE THE AUDIENCE? >> WELL, POPPY, I AM NOT PART OF\nTHE CAMPAIGN. I'M NOT INVOLVED IN THE DECISION\nMAKING PROCESS. >> RIGHT, BUT YOU'RE A\nSUPPORTER. WHAT WOULD YOUR ADVICE BE?\n>> THIS IS THE THING. THESE EVENTS ARE NOT THROWN\nTOGETHER AT THE LAST MINUTE, SO I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THEY HAVE\nHAD THESE EVENTS PLANNED. BUT IT IS POSSIBLE THEY HAVE HAD\nTHE EVENTS PLANNED AND HE'S CHANGING WHAT HE'S TALKING\nABOUT, HIS SPEECHES. AND I THINK THAT THAT IS OKAY.\nI MEAN, AT SOME POINT, HE HAS TO START REACHING OUT.\nI THINK THAT IF HE CAN GO TO THE INNER CITIES, IF HE CAN GO TO\nTHE BLACK CHURCHES, BY ALL MEANS, HE SHOULD.\nLOOK, I, AS A FEMALE, AND AS A WOMAN, AND AS A MINORITY, I\nMEAN, IT IS AN INSULT TO ME TO THINK THAT, AND IT'S OFFENSIVE\nTO THINK THAT I WOULD VOTE FOR HILLARY CLINTON JUST BECAUSE I'M\nA WOMAN AND BECAUSE SHE'S A WOMAN.\nAND I THINK DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS, NO VOTE SHOULD BE\nTAKEN FOR GRANTED. THESE CANDIDATES NEED TO GO OUT\nAND WORK FOR THE VOTES AND ASK FOR THE VOTES.\nYOU KNOW WHAT. IF IT'S WHAT HE'S BEEN DOING IS\nNOT WORKING AND NOW HE'S GOT A SHAKEUP IN HIS CAMPAIGN OR THE\nCHANGES, I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING.\n>> I THINK -- >> LET'S SEE WHAT IS GOING TO\nWORK. IF HE GOES OUT AND ASKS FOR IT,\nTHAT'S GOOD. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE HE IS.\nHE'S SPEAKING TO THE WORLD BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGY.\n>> BECAUSE OF CNN, RIGHT? BECAUSE WE AIRED IT.\nLET'S TALK ABOUT IT. THIS COMES ON THE HEELS OF THESE\nPOLL NUMBERS WHERE HE'S REALLY STRUGGLING IN KEY BATTLEGROUND\nSTATES. THIS COMES ON THE HEELS OF A\nNUMBER OF HEADLINES THIS WEEK THAT SAID DONALD TRUMP CANNOT\nWIN THIS ELECTION IF HE WINS EVERY SINGLE WHITE WORKING CLASS\nVOTE IN THIS COUNTRY. BY THE WAY, HE'S STRUGGLING WITH\nWHITE COLLEGE-EDUCATED VOTERS RIGHT NOW.\nRYAN, TO YOU, I WANT TO PLAY THIS MOMENT FROM BACK IN\nFEBRUARY WHEN TRUMP WAS ON WITH OUR JAKE TAPPER.\n>> THERE ARE THESE GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS ENDORSING YOU.\nWOULD YOU JUST SAY UNEQUIVOCALLY, YOU CONDEMN THEM\nAND DON'T WANT THEIR SUPPORT? >> WELL, I HAVE TO LOOK AT THE\nGROUP. I DON'T KNOW WHAT GROUP YOU'RE\nTALKING ABOUT. YOU WOULDN'T WANT ME TO CONDEMN\nA GROUP I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT. I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK.\nIF YOU WOULD SEND ME A LIST OF THE GROUPS, I WILL DO RESEARCH\nON THEM AND CERTAINLY I WOULD DISAVOW IF I THOUGHT THERE WAS\nSOMETHING WRONG. BUT YOU MAY --\n>> THE KU KLUX KLAN -- >> IT WOULD BE VERY UNFAIR, SO\nGIVE ME A LIST OF THE GROUPS. >> I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID DUKE\nAND THE KU KLUX KLAN HERE. >> I DON'T KNOW -- HONESTLY, I\nDON'T KNOW DAVID DUKE. I DON'T BELIEVE I HAVE EVER MET\nHIM. I'M PRETTY SURE I DIDN'T MEET\nHIM. DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HIM.\n>> THAT WAS THE EXCHANGE ABOUT KKK GRAND WIZARD DAVID DUKE.\nI SHOULD NOTE, TRUMP CAME OUT LATER, AS YOU KNOW, DISAVOWED\nDAVID DUKE. HOW DOES HE PUSH FOR\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS IN THE FACE OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT?\n>> YEAH, I MEAN, THAT'S -- IT'S SORT OF UNPRECEDENTED IN MODERN\nPOLITICS WHERE A POLITICIAN AT THAT LEVEL TO HEAR THE WORD KKK\nAND NOT JUST INSTANTLY BE OKAY WITH CONDEMNING IT.\nSO IT'S BEEN, YOU KNOW, HE'S GOT A VERY, VERY BLEMISHED RECORD\nWHEN IT COMES TO THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY.\nTHEN I THINK HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO DO A LOT TO GO TO THAT\nCOMMUNITY AND EXPLAIN, YOU KNOW, IN HIS EARLY DAYS IN THE REAL\nESTATE WORLD IN NEW YORK, WHY DID THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\nPENALIZE HIM FOR DISCRIMINATORY HOUSING?\nTHERE WAS A FAMOUS AD IN NEW YORK THAT HE TOOK OUT THAT A LOT\nOF PEOPLE IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY FIND, FOUND OFFENSIVE.\nFIVE TEENAGERS CONVICTED OF A CRIME THEY DIDN'T COMMIT, AND HE\nCALLED FOR THE DEATH PENALTY. A BIG CONTROVERSY, HAD ALL SORTS\nOF -- >> THEY WERE EXONERATED IN 2014.\n>> YOU KNOW THE LIST OF THESE THINGS.\nAND I'M SURE HOLLY AND HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN IS GOING TO\nPRESS THAT LIST AND RUN ADS IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY TO REMIND\nTHOSE VOTERS OF THIS HISTORY. THAT'S A LOT OF BACKAGE TO\nOVERCOME IN THAT COMMUNITY. AND WHEN HIS PITCH IS TO GO TO A\nWHITE, ALL-WHITE RALLY AND SAY, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE LIVING IN\nMISERY. YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE, VOTE\nFOR ME, I JUST -- IT DOESN'T SOUND TO ME LIKE THE MOST\nSOPHISTICATED STRATEGY IN THE WORLD.\n>> RYAN, AMY, HOLLY, MUCH MORE AHEAD WITH YOU.\nTHANK YOU FOR JOINING US. GOT TO GET A BREAK IN, BUT WE\nHAVE A LOT AHEAD THIS HOUR. TO LOUISIANA WE WILL GO.\nFLOOD-RAVAGED LOUISIANA STILL COPING WITH THE WORST NATURAL\nDISASTER IN THIS COUNTRY SINCE SUPERSTORM SANDY.\nMORE RAIN CONTINUING TO FALL AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE FAMILIES\nWAITING TO TRY TO SEE IF THEY EVEN HAVE A HOME LEFT.\n>> ALSO, A WARNING TO PREGNANT WOMEN, DO NOT GO TO PARTS OF\nMIAMI BEACH.",

LOOK, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE?\nYOU'RE LIVING IN POVERTY. YOUR SCHOOLS ARE NO GOOD.\nYOU HAVE NO JOBS. 58% OF YOUR YOUTH IS UNEMPLOYED.\nWHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE?\n>> ALL RIGHT, THIS IS THE SECOND TIME WE HAVE SEEN TRUMP MADE A\nPLAY FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS THIS WEEK.\nHE MAY DO THAT AGAIN TONIGHT WHEN HE SPEAKS IN JUST A FEW\nHOURS. WE SHOULD NOTE, THE NUMBER THAT\nTRUMP CITED IN THAT, WHAT YOU JUST HEARD, THAT BLACK YOUTH\nUNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS MISLEADING, ACCORDING TO CNN'S REALITY CHECK\nTEAM. THE LABOR DEPARTMENT SAYS THAT\nNUMBER IS 18.7%. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FOR BLACK\nYOUTH, THAT'S FAR BELOW TRUMP'S NUMBER, STILL DOUBLE THE\nUNEMPLOYMENT RATE FOR WHITE YOUTH IN THIS COUNTRY.\nLET'S TALK TO OUR POLITICAL PANEL.\nWITH ME NOW, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT FOR THE NEW\nYORKER, RYAN LIZZA, AMY KREMER IS ALSO WITH ME, SHE SUPPORTS\nDONALD TRUMP, AND DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST AND FORMER DNC\nSPOKESPERSON HOLLY SHULMAN IS WITH US.\nNICE TO HAVE YOU ALL HERE.

HILLARY CLINTON HAS 91%.\nTHAT'S AN NBC/\"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" POLL.\nLOOK, HE MADE A HUGE PUSH LAST NIGHT IN MICHIGAN FOR THE BLACK\nVOTE. DO YOU THINK HE WILL MAKE THAT\nPITCH TONIGHT, AND HOW DOES HE DO IT MOST EFFECTIVELY TO TRY TO\nAT LEAST GET THE 1% A LOT HIGHER?\n>> WELL, I THINK THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THERE IS ROOM FOR\nIMPROVEMENT. HE CAN'T GO ANYWHERE BUT UP.\nI THINK HE HAS TO ASK FOR THE VOTE.\nAND THAT'S, I THINK, WHAT HE HAS STARTED DOING THIS WEEK.\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED UNDER THIS\nADMINISTRATION WHEN THERE ARE MORE LIVING IN POVERTY, MORE\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS LIVING IN POVERTY, WHEN THE MEDIAN INCOME\nHAS FALLEN, WHEN THE NUMBER OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS HAS INCREASED\nALMOST 58% TO OVER 11 MILLION ON FOOD STAMPS, WHAT HE'S SAYING\nIS, YOU KNOW, LOOK. IT'S TIME FOR CHANGE.\nTHE DEFINITION OF INSANITY IS TO CONTINUE TO DO THE SAME THING\nOVER AND OVER AGAIN AND EXPECT DIFFERENT RESULTS.\nAND IF WE LIVE WITH A HILLARY CLINTON ADMINISTRATION, THIS IS\nGOING TO BE FOUR MORE YEARS OF THE SAME FAILED POLICIES OF\nBARACK OBAMA. I THINK HE IS GOING TO POINT\nTHAT OUT. >> AMY, THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT\nMINORITIES, ESPECIALLY BLACKS AND HISPANICS IN THIS COUNTRY\nFARED WORSE IN TERMS OF JOB LOSSES, POVERTY, ET CETERA,\nDURING THE GREAT RECESSION. HOWEVER, IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT\nOUT THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT BLACK TEENAGERS BETWEEN 16 AND 24,\nTHEIR UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS DROPPED BY MORE THAN HALF UNDER\nTHE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, FROM THE HIGH POINT DURING THE\nADMINISTRATION TO NOW. >> RIGHT.\nBUT POPPY, WHAT HE SAID WAS LAST NIGHT WHEN HE SAID WHAT THE HELL\nDO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? I THINK THAT CAN BE SAID FOR ALL\nAMERICANS. IT'S EQUIVALENT, TO I THINK WHAT\nPRESIDENT REAGAN SAID WHEN HE SAID ARE YOU BETTER OFF NOW THAN\nYOU WERE FOUR YEARS AGO? AND ARE YOU?\nEVERY AMERICAN SHOULD BE LOOKING AT ALL OF THESE CANDIDATES AND\nLOOKING AT THEIR POLICIES AND LISTENING TO THE THINGS THEY\nSAY, AND A VOTE IS A VERY PERSONAL",

MOMENTS AGO AT TRUMP TOWER, THE\nREPUBLICAN CANDIDATE WRAPPED UP A MEETING WITH THE NATIONAL\nHISPANIC ADVISERS AND THE RNC. THIS COMES ON THE HEELS OF HIS\nSPEECH LAST NIGHT WHERE HE MADE AN UNCONVENTIONAL KIND OF PLEA\nFOR BLACK VOTERS. LATER TODAY, TRUMP WILL CONTINUE\nHIS CAMPAIGNING IN FREDERICKSBURG, VIRGINIA, WHERE\nWE FIND KRISTEN HOLMES. AND KRISTEN, WHAT CAN YOU TELL\nUS ABOUT TODAY'S MEETING WITH THE HISPANIC ADVISERS AND TRUMP?\n>> Reporter: MARTIN, THIS IS THE CAMPAIGN'S BIGGEST EFFORT TO\nREACH THOSE HISPANIC VOTERS TO DATE.\nTHE CAMPAIGN SITTING DOWN WITH REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE AS\nWELL AS A GROUP THAT THEY CALL THE NATIONAL HISPANIC ADVISORY\nCOUNCIL FOR TRUMP. NOW, IN A STATEMENT PUT OUT BY\nTHE RNC, THIS GROUP CONSISTS OF CIVIC, BUSINESS, AND RELIGIOUS\nLEADERS ACROSS 12 STATES AND THE GOAL OF TODAY'S MEETING, AGAIN,\nACCORDING TO THE STATEMENT, IS TO INSURE THEY HAVE WAYS FOR THE\nHISPANIC COMMUNITY TO UNDERSTAND WHERE TRUMP STANDS ON CERTAIN\nISSUES, INCLUDING TERRORISM AND THE ECONOMY.\nNOW, OF COURSE, THIS IS AS YOU MENTIONED, ONE OF TRUMP'S NEW\nEFFORTS TO REACH OUT TO MINORITIES.\nHE IS TRAILING BEHIND, IN THE LATEST FOX NEWS LATINO POLL, HE\nWAS TRAILING HILLARY CLINTON WITH THOSE ELIGIBLE LATINO\nVOTERS BY 46 POINTS. THEY ARE TRYING TO REACH OUT TO\nTHESE DIFFERENT GROUPS. OF COURSE, YOU'LL REMEMBER WHEN\nHE ANNOUNCED HE WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, HE SAID IMMIGRANTS\nCOMING IN FROM MEXICO WERE RAPISTS AND DRUG DEALERS,\nALIENATING SEVERAL PEOPLE. AGAIN, CONTINUING TO ALIENATE\nTHOSE GROUPS OF HISPANICS BY HIS IMMIGRATION POLICY, WHICH MANY\nPEOPLE FEEL IS RACIST. ONE OF HIS BIGGEST POLICY\nTALKING POINTS IS BUILDING THE WALL.\nTHIS IS JUST ONE STEP IN THE DIRECTION TRUMP TRYING TO REACH\nOUT TO THESE MINORITY GROUPS. LAST NIGHT AND THE NIGHT BEFORE,\nHE WAS MAKING AN APPEAL TO AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS.\nRECENT POLLS HAVE HIM IN THE 1% RANGE AMONG THAT VOTING\nDEMOGRAPHIC. >> AND HE'S OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN\nTRAIL LATER, SO WHAT DO WE EXPECTS TO HEAR?\n>> Reporter: WELL, WE ARE IN A CRUCIAL BATTLEGROUND STATE OF\nVIRGINIA. AND LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE\nMOST RECENT QUINNIPIAC POLL. IF WE HAVE IT HERE, IT SHOWS\nHILLARY CLINTON IS UP 50% TO 38%.\nTHESE NUMBERS, THEY WERE EXPECTING A LITTLE BOUNCE COMING\nOUT OF THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION, BUT NOW WE'RE STILL\nUP ON THESE NUMBERS. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT MITT\nROMNEY ONLY LOST THE STATE OF VIRGINIA BY FOUR POINTS IN 2012.\nSO THIS 12-POINT DIFFERENCE IS HUGE.\nSO I THINK WE CAN EXPECT TO HEAR A LOT OF WHAT WE HAVE BEEN\nHEARING LATELY, WHICH IS DONALD TRUMP ATTEMPTING TO BE MORE\nMAINSTREAM. ATTEMPTING TO APPEAL MORE TO THE\nBASE, NOT JUST HIS BASE BUT THE REPUBLICAN BASE IN GENERAL.\nMARTIN. >> KRISTEN HOLMES, THANK YOU\nVERY MUCH FOR THAT. >> IN DONALD TRUMP'S CONTINUED\nEFFORT TO REACH OUT TO MINORITY VOTERS, HE IS OFFERING A NEW\nCAMPAIGN PROMISE. HE TOLD A CROWD OF MOSTLY WHITE\nSUPPORTERS IN MICHIGAN THAT HE WILL WIN 95% OF THE\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE WITNESS HE IS RE-ELECTED IN 2020.\nHE THEN MADE HIS PITCH DIRECTLY TO BLACK VOTERS.\n>> I SAY IT AGAIN. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE?\nLOOK, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? YOU'RE LIVING IN POVERTY.\nYOUR SCHOOLS ARE NO GOOD. YOU HAVE NO JOBS.\n58% OF YOUR YOUTH IS UNEMPLOYED. WHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO\nLOSE? >> TO TALK ABOUT THIS STRATEGY\nAND WHETHER IT WILL HAVE ANY EFFECT ON TRUMP'S STANDING AMONG\nMINORITITIES, I'M JOINED BY FORMER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATE AND ADVISER TO DONALD TRUMP, DR. BEN CARSON.\nTHANK YOU, SIR, FOR JOINING ME. >> ABSOLUTELY.\n>> SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE MAY\nCOMMUNICATE SOMETHING TO PEOPLE, BUT I'M NOT SURE IT'S REALLY THE\nBEST PITCH. I DO BELIEVE THAT DONALD TRUMP\nHAS A MESSAGE HE COULD COMMUNICATE.\nWHAT I'M ASKING OF YOU IS WHEN YOU JUST SAY WHAT THE HELL HAVE\nYOU GOT TO LOSE, IS THAT REALLY RESPECTFULLY MAKING AN APPROACH\nTO AN ELECTORATE? >> WELL, AGAIN, IN ALL THESE\nCASES, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK BEYOND THE WORDS AND ASK\nWHAT IS THE MESSAGE THAT'S BEING COMMUNICATED?\nAND BASICALLY, WHAT HE'S SAYING IS AFTER THE LAST SEVERAL\nDECADES, WHERE YOU HAVE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE PROMISING, YOU\nKNOW, ALL KINDS OF THINGS, WHICH HAVE ONLY LED TO DEPENDENCY AND\nREALLY HAVEN'T LED TO THE",

AND THE CASE IN POINT IS NOW\nWHAT HE'S DOING, REACHING OUT TO PERHAPS AN ELECTORATE THAT IS\nNOT REALLY LIKELY FOR HIM. >> I HEARD HIM TALK ABOUT\nCHARTER SCHOOLS. I HEARD HIM TALK HOBBIT HOW\nTRADE SHIFTS JOBS TO THE RUST BELT TO OTHER COUNTRIES.\nI HEARD HIM TALK ABOUT CRIME. I HEARD HIM TALK ABOUT THE NEED\nFOR LAW AND ORDER TO KEEP ZSH. >> BUT YOU'RE NOT THE AUDIENCE\nHE WAS ALLEGEDLY REACHING TO. >> I'M SORRY?\n>> YOU'RE NOT THAT AUDIENCE HE WAS REACHING TO.\n>> NO.

GIVE ME YOUR THOUGHTS ON IT.\n>> WELL I THINK IT'S INTERESTING, I MEAN EVER SINCE\nEVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED IN THE YEAR 2000, I THINK VOTERS\nDISTRUST OF THE SYSTEM IS HIGH, YOU KNOW.\nAND WE NEED TO DO MORE I THINK JUST ACROSS THE BOARD ON BOTH\nSIDES OF THE PARTY AND BOTH PARTY TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS\nNOT WHAT'S COMING ACROSS, THAT PEOPLE DO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE\nIS A FAIR ELECTION SYSTEM. I MEAN THAT'S PART OF THE CORE\nOF OUR DEMOCRACY. SO I DO THINK THERE'S WORK\nLITERALLY ON BOTH SIDES THAT WE NEED TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT\nVOTERS TRUST AND KNOW. I MEAN WE JUST SEE IN SOME OF\nTHESE STATES TOO AND SOME OF THE STATE LEGISLATURES SOME OF THE\nLAWS THAT THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO PASS THAT PEOPLE FEEL ARE\nRESTRICTING VOTES. THERE'S A LOT HAPPENING ON THE\nGROUND THAT REALLY CHIPS AWAY AT VOTING RIGHTS.\nAS A COMMUNITY I HOPE WE ALL MAKE SURE THIS IS OUR MAIN FOCUS\nAND AS WE'RE GOING INTO THE FINAL DAYS.\n>> WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE IT THERE.\nTHANK YOU BOTH FOR JOINING ME. WE'LL BE TALKING MORE ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP. NEXT HOUR WE'LL DISCUSS HIS\nCOMMENTS AND WHAT HE'S DOING TO APPEAL TO MINORITIES.\nAND THAT CONVERSATION IS GOING TO BE WITH DR. BEN CARSON.\nHE OF COURSE IS THE FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.\nHE'S JOIN US AT 2:00 P.M.",

BECAUSE WHEN WE AS A STATE WANT\nTO BE SUCCESSFUL, WE NEED TO BLACK COMMUNITY, WE NEED\nDETROIT, WE NEED FLINT, WE NEED THOSE COMMUNITIES TO BE\nSUCCESSFUL.

AND THAT TELLS YOU THAT DONALD\nTRUMP'S PROMISES ARE COMPLETELY MEANINGLESS BECAUSE HE LIKES TO\nGO OVER THE TOP RHETORIC BUT HAS NOT PRODUCED ANYTHING.\nAND WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN MICHIGAN, IN FLINT, MICHIGAN, IT\nWAS A REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR THAT KREE KWATED THE WATER CRISIS AND\nA DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION THAT BAILED OUT THE AUTO INDUSTRY.\nDEMOCRATS HAVE A HISTORY OF LIFTING PEOPLE UP WHILE DONALD\nTRUMP AND REPUBLICANS HAVE A HISTORY OF TRYING TO, YOU KNOW,\nDISENFRANCHISE VOTERS AND GET LESS PEOPLE TO THE ELECTION\nRATHER THAN MORE. >> PETER, I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE\nLAST SAY HERE.

LET'S PUT UP THE STATS.\nBECAUSE THE NUMBERS ARE IMPORTANT HERE.\nTHE FACTS MATTER. AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT\nRATE 8.4% LOWER THAN IT'S BEEN FOR SOME TIME.\nLET'S GO TO THE STATISTICS AS IT RELATES TO BLACKS LIVING IN THE\nTHE POVERTY LINE IN 2014. THE LATEST NUMBER FROM CENSUS,\n26.2%. NOT EVEN A PLURALITY OF BLACKS\nLIVING UNDER THE POVERTY LINE. STILL TOO HIGH.\nLET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THE AUDIENCES.\nIF DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO MAKE A PITCH TO BLACK VOTERS, WHY ISN'T\nHE SPEAKING TO BLACK AUDIENCES. HE HAS A SPATE OF BLACK PASTORS\nTHAT SUPPORT HIM. WHY DID HE DECLINE THE\nINVITATION FROM THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FROM THE\nBLACKJOURNALIST AND THE NAACP AND HE WANTS THEIR VOTES HE HAS\nASK TO ASK FOR THEM. >> I REPRESENT THE NATIONAL\nDIVERSITY COALITION FOR TRUMP. I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE CAMPAIGN\nIN TERMS OF WHERE THEY TRAVEL AND WHAT VENUE THEY GO TO.\nI HAVE ACTUALLY SAID IN THESE MEETINGS AND HONORED TO BE\nLISTENING AMONGST SOME OF OUR BEST PASTORS AND AWESOME PASTORS\nFROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY. LIKE I SAID PREVIOUSLY, THIS HAS\nBEEN AN ONGOING THING FOR YEARS. >> IF IT'S BEEN YEARS AND YEARS\nHE SHOULD HAVE A BLACK CHURCH HE KNOWS HE CAN GO TO.\nIF IT'S BEEN YEARS AND YEARS HE WOULD HAVE SPOKEN AT NAACP AND\nNBJ, URBAN LEAGUE BEFORE. SO WHY IS IT HE'S SPEAKING TO\nBLACK AUDIENCES? WHEN YOU GO INTO DIAMOND DALE,\nDOESN'T THAT SEEM CONDESCENDING? >> NO.\nONCE AGAIN I WAS ASKED THIS QUESTION ON ANOTHER SHOW.\nYOU KNOW, WHEN MR. TRUMP MOVES, YOU KNOW, AND HE COMES TO A\nCITY. IF THERE'S NOT A VENUE THAT\nREACHES 20,000, 50,000 PEOPLE, IT'S SO MUCH ABOUT THE VENUE.\nTHE OTHER THING TWO, RESPECTFULLY.\nWHEN HE HAS A SPEECH THERE IS MILLIONS OF VIEWERS THAT WATCH\nHIM. DONALD TRUMP COMES TO TOWN, IT\nTAKES A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND RESOURCE.\nI'M NOT TRYING TO DODGE THAT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.\n>> I HEAR YOU THERE. IF HE WANTS THE LAW ENFORCEMENT\nVOTE HE MADE TIME TO GO TO THE FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE.\nHE WENT TO THE FAITH AND FREEDOM CONFERENCE.\nWE'VE GOT TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK. WE'LL CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION.\nWE HAVE MUCH MORE TO DISCUSS AFTER THE BREAK AND WE'LL BE\nRIGHT BACK.",

YOUR SCHOOLS ARE NO GOOD, NO\nJOBS, AND YOU'RE ALL POOR. >> I THINK WHAT HE WAS TALKING\nABOUT THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE.\nI MEAN, WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT JOBS.\nSO, WHAT HIS STATEMENT, I THINK, WHAT HE SAID YESTERDAY, IS THE\nEQUIVALENT, NOT JUST TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS BUT ALL\nAMERICANS TO WHAT RONALD REAGAN SAID IN 1980, YOU KNOW, ARE YOU\nBETTER OFF NOW THAN YOU WERE FOUR YEARS AGO?\nWHAT IS THE DEFINITION OF INSANITY?\nTO DO THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN.\nIT'S THAT DIFFERENT RESULT. WE HAD EIGHT YEARS OF PRESIDENT\nOBAMA IN HIS ADMINISTRATION. I BELIEVE THAT HILLARY CLINTON\nWOULD BE FOUR MORE YEARS OF THE SAME.\nWHY NOT TRY SOMETHING NEW. >> IT SEEMS LIKE A VERY\nDIFFERENT ARGUMENT WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING AND WHAT DONALD TRUMP\nSAID YESTERDAY. WE SHOULD SAY THAT HIS COMMENTS\nWERE NOT PART OF THE SCRIPTED, PREPARED REMARKS FOR DIMONDALE.\nBUT HE DESCRIBED AFRICAN-AMERICANS AS A WHOLE, AS\nPOOR, POOR SCHOOLS. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A\nCOMMENTARY ON EDUCATION OF BLACK PEOPLE OR THE INSTITUTION, AND\nHAVING NO JOBS. WE KNOW THE STATISTICS DON'T\nSUPPORT THAT CHARACTERIZATION? >> WELL, I THINK EDUCATION IS\nSAY BIG ISSUE FOR FAMILIES AUTOMATIC ACROSS THE COUNTRY.\n>> I'M SURE EVERYBODY DOES. WHY CHARACTERIZE A GROUP OF\nPEOPLE AS POOR BE NOT WORKING, HAVING THESE POOR SCHOOLS?\n>> I DON'T THINK THAT'S HOW HE CHARACTERIZES THAT FOR THE\nPEOPLE. I THINK WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT\nIS THE POLICY OF THIS ADMINISTRATION AND THAT THIS\nPRESIDENT HAS NOT DONE A LOT FOR THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY.\nWHEN HE TALKS ABOUT THE FIGURE --\n>> 58%. >> -- 58% UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FOR\nTHE YOUTH. THAT'S A CONCERN.\n>> IT IS A CONCERN. AND I DON'T MEAN TO CUT YOU OFF,\nWHEN YOU GET TO THE NUMBERS, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO MATCH\nTHAT WITH THAT. THE NUMBER THAT I THINK DONALD\nTRUMP IS COMING UP WITH BECAUSE IT IS UNCLEAR IS THE INVERSE OF\nTHE STATISTICS IN MAY. 41% OF PEOPLE 16 TO 24 WERE\nPARTICIPATING IN THE MARKET. SO THAT 58 CHANGES THE INVERSE.\nBUT THAT COUNTS EVERYBODY 16 THROUGH 24, INCLUDING 11th GRADE\nFOOTBALL PLAYERS AND COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO WOULDN'T NORMALLY\nBE IN THE WORKFORCE ANYWAY, AND THAT WOULD BRING THE NUMBER\nDOWN. LET ME COME TO YOU, SCOTT.\nAND I'VE GOT YOU BOTH LIVE. WHEN YOU HEAR WHAT DONALD TRUMP\nSAID ABOUT AFRICAN-AMERICANS NOT BEING MUCH BETTER OFF AFTER THE\nOBAMA ADMINISTRATION THAN BEFORE, ARE YOU CONCERNED THAT\nTHAT ARGUMENT COULD RESONATE? >> I HAVE ZERO CONCERNS THAT\nTHAT ARGUMENT WOULD RESONATE. I MEAN, HIS BROAD FACE STATEMENT\nIS JUST NORTHERLY OFFENSIVE REMARK AND INSENSITIVE AND BASED\nON IGNORANCE. I'M PART OF BLACK AMERICA.\nI'M EDUCATED. I HAVE A HOME, AND I'VE GOT LOTS\nOF FRIENDS WHO ARE EMPLOYED. ENTREPRENEURS OR EVEN LOOKING\nFOR JOBS FOR THAT MATTER. TO SAY BLACK AMERICA WHICH IS\nNOT HOMOGENEOUS BY ANY MEANS IS NOT SHOWING LACK OF KNOWLEDGE.\nHE'S MAKING THESE STATEMENTS IN FRONT OF ALL-WHITE AUDIENCES.\nHE ATTACKS PRESIDENT OBAMA BE THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nPRESIDENT OF THIS COUNTRY AND IS WITH 1% OF BLACK VOTERS.\nTHIS KIND OF BROAD FACE STATEMENT IS NOT GETTING HIM\nBLACK VOTES. HE WON'T GO AND TALK TO THE\nKNAPP AND URBAN LEAGUE AND BLACK AUDIENCES AND GIVE US A PLAN.\nLIKE EVERYTHING OF DONALD TRUMP, HE HAS A STATEMENT BUT HE\nDOESN'T HAVE A PLAN. >> AMY, BACK TO YOU, HE'S\nSITTING IN DIMONDALE WITH A PERCENTAGE OF WHITE RESIDENTS,\n93, GIVE OR TAKE A HALF PERCENT, THE MAKEUP THERE, THE DEM\nGRAPHICS. WHY DOESN'T HE GO TO DETROIT OR\nONE OF THE CHURCHES? >> IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT HE'S NOT\nGOING TO. >> WHY HASN'T HE?\n>> I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE CAMPAIGN.\nI'M NOT IN THE MIDDLE OF THESE DECISIONS.\nWHAT I WILL SAY, HE IS GIVING A SPEECH THAT EVERYONE ACROSS THE\nCOUNTRY AND ANYWHERE ACROSS THE WORLD CAN HEAR.\nWITH TECHNOLOGY TODAY, YOU CAN HEAR IT ANYWHERE.\nTHERE'S PLENTY OF TIME. WHO'S TO STAY HE'S NOT GOING TO\nGO THERE. BUT I WILL SAY, THEY DON'T THROW\nTHESE EVENTS TOGETHER AT THE LAST MINUTE.\nWHOSE TO SAY HE DIDN'T ALREADY HAVE THIS EVENT PLANNED AND\nHE'S -- >> I DON'T KNOW THAT ANYONE IS\nSAYING THAT. >> THIS IS THE THING, IT'S THAT,\nYOU KNOW WHAT, WE'RE ALL AMERICANS.\nWE ALL BLEED RED. LET'S STOP WITH THE RACE STUFF.\nIF HE HAD SAT DOWN AND TALKED TO WOMEN -- NO WAY.\nIS HE GOING TO BE ACCUSED TO REACHING OUT TO WOMEN?\n>> IS THAT A BAD THING THAT HE'S REACHING OUT TO WOMEN?\n>> NO, BUT THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING, IT'S LIKE HE'S BAD THAT\nHE'S REACHING OUT. AT LEAST HE'S REACHING OUT.\nHE'S GOT A DIVERSITY POLL ISSUE. >> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE\nCOALITION UP AT 10:30. WHEN YOU SAID HE'S REACHING OUT,\nHOW? HE TALKS ABOUT AFRICAN-AMERICANS\nIN THE SPEECH. BUT FROM THE REPORTING THERE,\nTHERE AREN'T MANY AFRICAN-AMERICANS THERE.\nHE'S GOT BLACK TAXES TO SUPPORT THEM, WHY NOT GO TO THE BLACK\nTURFS. HE DENIED THE URBAN LEAGUE, THE\nDENIED THE NCAA. IF HE HAS THIS MESSAGE FOR\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS, SAY IT TO A BLACK PERSON IN PERSON.\n>> I AS A VOTER WANT TO BE AN EDUCATED VOTER, I CAN GO TO\nHILLARY CLINTON'S WEBSITE AND DONALD TRUMP WEBSITE AND WHERE\nWHERE THEIR EVENTS ARE. YOU SHOULD BE PAYING ATTENTION\nTO THESE CANDIDATES AND YOU SHOULD ATTEND THEIR EVENTS.\nYOU SHOULD READ THEIR ISSUES ON THEIR WEBSITE AND LISTEN TO WHAT\nTHEY'RE SAYING. HE'S AT LEAST REACHING OUT.\nHE IS REAPING OUT, I BELIEVE. YOU HAVE TO START A CONVERSATION\nSOMEWHERE. >> PART OF THE CONVERSATION IS\nHAVING THE PERSON HOPING TO SPEAK WITH ON THE OTHER END OF\nIT.

I TOTALLY REAGREE FROM EARLIER,\nTHE TONE AT WHICH HE TALKED TO THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY\nWAS SO DISRESPECTFUL AND SO CONDESCENDING.\nTHE PROBLEM IS, NOW THAT DONALD TRUMP IS LOSING IN THE POLLS,\nHE'S NOW BEGGING AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS TO VOTE\nFOR HIM. IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.\nALSO, CONGRESSMAN, WOULD YOU SAY THAT MILWAUKEE AND FERGUSON AND\nBALTIMORE WERE BECAUSE OF DEMOCRATS -- NO.\nIT'S BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE PROPER TRAINING FOR WHITE POLICE\nOFFICERS WHO ARE KILLING ARMED AND UNARMED AFRICAN-AMERICAN MEN\nAND WOMEN. SO, LISTEN, CONGRESSMAN, THE\nPROBLEM IS YOU WOULD HAVE NEVER IN THE COUNTY, WHERE YOU\nREPRESENTED, WENT TO TALK TO THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY IN A\n93% AREA AND ALL-WHITE CROWD. THE FIRST THING THAT DONALD\nTRUMP NEEDS TO DO IF HE WANTS TO APPEAL THAT, HE NEEDS TO EMBRACE\nUS AND SIT DOWN AND UNDERSTAND OUR ISSUES.\nI THINK THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS AN OUTSTANDING PARTY FOR US.\nAND MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHAT DID WE GET OUT OF IT?\nWE GOT PRESIDENT OBAMA WHO HAS DONE A WONDERFUL JOB AS\nPRESIDENT AND A 54% APPROVAL RATE.\n>> LET'S GIVE THE CONGRESSMAN AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS MORE THAN A FEW BLACK PASTORS WHO SUPPORT HIM.\nWHY NOT GO TO ONE OF THOSE CHURCHES, GOES TO DELIVER ONE OF\nTHE MESSAGES? >> LET ME SAY THIS, YOU'RE GOING\nTO SAY THAT AND THAT -- >> WHEN HAS THAT HAPPENED?\nNEVER. >> LET ME MAKE THIS POINT.\nWHEREVER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES FACE THE MICROPHONE OF THE\nNATION, IT'S NOT THE CROWD THAT'S THERE.\nWHEN HE HAS HIS RALLY 15,000 PEOPLE SHOW.\nWHEN HE SPOKE IN NORTH CAROLINA THE OTHER INSIDE, IT WAS AN\nINTEGRATED CROWD. HE IS OUT THERE REACHING OUT.\nAND HILLARY CLINTON -- >> BEFORE YOU GET TO HILLARY\nCLINTON -- WE'LL TALK TO HER AFTER THE BREAK -- WHEN DONALD\nTRUMP WANTED TO COURT THE CHRISTIAN CONSERVATIVE VOTE HE\nWENT TO THE FAITH. IF YOU WANT THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nVOTE, DON'T YOU HAVE TO GO TO ACTUAL AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND ASK\nTHEM FOR THEIR VOTE. >> LET ME SAY THIS, WHAT YOU SAW\nTHIS WEEK SAN INVITATION TO START THAT ENGAGEMENT.\nI THINK YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IT. AND I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BE\nPLEASED. WHEN YOU SEE IT, THE DEMOCRATS\nARE GOING TO BE SCARED TO DEATH BECAUSE THEY'VE TAKEN THE BLACK\nVOTE FOR GRANTED. >> WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK\nBREAK, GOING TO TALK ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON.\nJACK KINGSTON, AARON JACKSON,",

HE'S TALK ABOUT INNER CITIES AND\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS UNEMPLOYMENT BUT USUALLY AN OFF THE CUFF\nREMARK. WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW, WHICH IS\nNEW, IS THIS NEW POLISHED MESSAGE, AN APPEAL TO\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS.

VERY INTERESTING PITCH FROM HIM\nAND A VERY DIFFERENT DONALD TRUMP THERE'S NO DOUBT.\nTHE SCRIPTED REMARKS FOUR RALLIES IN A ROW, CAMPAIGN\nSHAKE-UP. SOMETHING INTERESTING AS WELL.\nHE WENT THERE AND HANDED OUT SOME THINGS.\nWE LEARNED LATER BECAUSE OF A PASTOR AT A CHURCH WHERE HE WAS\nHAPPENEDING THOSE THINGS OUT THAT HE ACTUALLY DONATED THE\nEIGHTEEN-WHEELER FILLED WITH SUPPLIES.\nIT WAS SOMETHING THAT HE DID WITHOUT SENDING OUT A PRESS\nRELEASE, WITHOUT BRAGGING ABOUT IT OR EVEN TELLING ANYONE ABOUT\nIT. THERE'S NO DOUBT IT'S A\nDIFFERENT DONALD TRUMP IN SOME RESPECTS.\nIN OTHER RESPECTS IT'S VERY SIMILAR.\nTAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT HE HAD TO SAY ABOUT LOUISIANA.\n>> I JUST GOT BACK FROM A TOUR OF THE SUFFERING AND DEVASTATION\nIN LOUISIANA. THE SPIRIT OF THE PEOPLE IS\nINCREDIBLE. THE DEVASTATION LIKEWISE THEY\nHAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT.\nBUT THE SPIRIT OF THE PEOPLE IS INCREDIBLE.\nHONESTLY, OBAMA OUGHT TO GET OFF THE GOLF COURSE AND GET DOWN THERE.\n>> Reporter: FOCUSED ON THAT MESSAGE, MENTIONING LOUISIANA,\nPRESIDENT OBAMA SHOULD GO. HE WILL GO NEXT TUESDAY, BY THE\nWAY. AS WE KNOW, THE GOVERNOR SAID IT\nWOULD BE BETTER FOR THE PRESIDENT TO WAIT.\nHILLARY CLINTON MEANWHILE ON THAT FRONT SHE SENT OUT AN\nE-MAIL TO SUPPORTERS ASKING FOR DONATIONS FOR VICTIMS IN\nLOUISIANA. AS WE KNOW TRUMP IS OUT WITH HIS\nFIRST MAJOR AD BUY DURING THE ELECTION IN FOUR DIFFERENT\nSTATES. THIS TRULY IS A TRUMP RESET. THE\nQUESTION IS HOW LONG WILL IT STICK WITH HIS NEW CAMPAIGN\nSTAFF AT THE TOP. HOW LONG WILL THEY DO\nPROMPTERSAL RALLIES, HOW LONG WILL HE STAY ON HIS MISSION IS\nYET TO BE SEEN. >> FOLLOWING DONALD TRUMP IN THE\nCAMPAIGN LET'S BRING IN PAUL SINGER, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT\nAND GABBY, WE'LL START WITH YOU. YOU WERE WRITING ABOUT BLACK\nVOTERS AND DONALD TRUMP'S MENTION OF THEM.\nYOU SAY WHY IS HE DOING THIS NOW, DOES HE REALLY THINK HE CAN\nRECOVER FROM THE POLLS. THE POLLS HAVE A 90% DEFICIT FOR\nDONALD TRUMP AT THE MOMENT. WHAT IS BEHIND THIS?\nIS HE REALLY GOING AFTER WHITE VOTERS?\nIS HE GOING AFTER WOMEN VOTERS HERE, JUST TRYING TO LEVEL IT\nOFF, IF YOU WILL, IN TERMS OF HIS HITTING ON CERTAIN POINTS\nTHAT HE MAY MAKE UNAPPEALING FOR VOTERS, AFRICAN-AMERICANS BEING\nONE OF THOSE NOTES. >> NO, I THINK HIS CAMPAIGN IS\nREALLY FOCUSED ON REACHING OUT TO THE BLACK COMMUNITY RIGHT\nNOW. HE TALKED ABOUT THIS IN\nWISCONSIN EARLIER THIS WEEK, ABOUT USING THIS MESSAGE THAT\nHE'S TALKED ABOUT, DEMOCRATIC POLICIES NOT WORKING FOR\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS AND HE'S USING THIS AS AN AVENUE TO ATTACK\nHILLARY CLINTON. AND YOU KNOW, DONALD TRUMP\nREALIZES HE'S LOSING GROUND AMONG NONCOLLEGE EDUCATED WHITE\nVOTERS. IN STATES LIKE OHIO AND\nPENNSYLVANIA WHERE THERE ARE HEAVILY BLACK CITIES, HE NEEDS\nTO AT LEAST GARNER ABOUT 3 OR 4% OF THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE.\nSO IT IS IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO BEGIN TO REACH OUT TO BLACK\nVOTERS. IT'S SOMETHING HE SHOULD HAVE\nBEEN DOING SINCE THE BEGINNING. THERE IS SOME DIFFICULTY THAT HE\nFACES IN ATTRACTING THEIR SUPPORT BECAUSE HE'S BEEN\nDENIGRATING THEM FOR THE PAST MONTHS.\n>> HOW HAS HE BEEN DENIGRATING THEM?\n>> HE'S TALKED A LOT ABOUT THINGS THAT APPLY TO RACIAL\nDIVISION IN THE COUNTRY, ACCUSED OF STOKING RACIAL TENSION AT HIS\nCAMPAIGN RALLIES, TIME AND TIME AGAIN THROUGHOUT THE PRIMARY, WE\nSAW BLACK ACTIVISTS AT CAMPAIGN RALLIES ASSAULTED, WHITE\nSUPPORTERS AT HIS CAMPAIGN RALLIES, DONALD TRUMP HAS\nBASEBALL A DIVISIVE FIGURE IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY.\nI THINK HE HAS A HILL TO CLIMB, QUITE FRANKLY, IF HE WANTS TO\nWIN THEIR SUPPORT. >> A BIG HILL.\nYOU SAW THE NUMBERS ON THE SCREEN, 91% GOING FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON, 1% GOING FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nAND AS GABBY WAS SAYING, SHE BELIEVES THAT HE HAS BEEN\nDENIGRATING THEM. HE CERTAINLY WAS OFTEN QUOTED\nWHEN HE SAID THERE'S MY AFRICAN-AMERICAN.\nIN THIS CASE HE COMES OUT WITH THESE NOTES THAT WE SAW IN THE\nSPEECH YESTERDAY TALKING ABOUT AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES,\nMAKING SOME RELATIONSHIP -- MAKING SOME ASSOCIATIONS HERE\nWITH ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS AND THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND\nINNER CITY AREAS. IS THIS WORKING FOR HIM HERE, DO\nYOU THINK, PAUL? IF HE'S TRYING TO GET SOME\nPERCENTAGE POINTS BACK? >> I DOUBT IT.\nI FIND THE STRATEGY A LITTLE WEIRD.\nFIRST OF ALL HE WENT TO BASICALLY AN ALL WHITE COMMUNITY\nAN HOUR AND A HALF FROM DETROIT TO GIVE HIS SPEECH YESTERDAY.\nHE SAID FROM THE PODIUM TO THE BLACK COMMUNITY, YOUR POOR, YOUR\nSCHOOLS ARE LOUSY AND YOU DON'T HAVE ANY JOBS.\nKEEP IN MIND NEW YORK CITY REPUBLICAN THAT GOTTEN ABOVE 10%\nIN THE GENERAL ELECTION IN 20 YEARS.\nDONALD TRUMP IS NOT GOING TO WIN THE ELECTION BASED ON THE BLACK\nVOTE. >> PAUL, DO YOU THINK, AND I\nASKED THE QUESTION OF GABBY A FEW MOMENTS AGO, REALLY THEY ARE\nGOING FOR MODERATES HERE, BY MODERATING HIS TONE TALKING\nABOUT AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS AND INNER CITY ISSUES.\n>> IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HE IS TRYING TO SORT OF LOOK\nREASONABLE ON A WHOLE ARRAY OF ISSUES AND SAY, WELL, HE COULD\nSAY TO HESS WHITE VOTERS WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT APPEARING RACIST\nIF THEY STAND NEXT TO DONALD TRUMP, THOSE VOTERS CAN SAY\nDONALD TRUMP IS NOT RACIST, HE'S CONCERNED ABOUT THE BLACK\nCOMMUNITY. I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW.\nREALLY, IF YOU WANT TO ENGAGE THE BLACK COMMUNITY MORE\nSIGNIFICANTLY, HE WOULD TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT BLACKS OF\nALL ECONOMIC CLASSES, POOR, RICH, MIDDLE CLASS BLACKS HAVE\nTO BE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT INTERACTIONS WITH THE POLICE\nTHAN WHITES OF THE SAME ECONOMIC CLASSES.\nTHAT IS A FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE THAT REACHES MORE ACROSS THE BLACK\nCOMMUNITY. >> IF YOU'RE HILLARY CLINTON AND\nHER CAMPAIGN, GABBY, LOOKING AT THE SWITCH IN TONE, TELEPROMPTER\nAS JACOB RASCONE IS TALKING ABOUT, STICKS TO THAT, THE\nMESSAGES HE BROUGHT UP IN THE LAST 48 HOURS, HE COMES OUT AND\nSAYS TO A LOT OF THESE GROUPS THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS FOR THE\nMOST PART TIED UP MINORITY VOTERS IS WHAT I'M ALLUDING TO\nHERE. HE'S SAYING WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO\nLOSE. HE SAID THAT IN A SPEECH.\nWHAT DO THEY HAVE TO LOSE? >> WELL, YOU KNOW, I THINK THE\nHILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN REALIZES THERE'S A BIG IF HERE.\nIF DONALD TRUMP DOES STICK TO THE MEBLG, TALK DIRECTLY TO\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS AND SAY, LOOK, I'M NOT FOCUSED ON\nINTRODUCING WHAT HE SAID IS THE NEW AMERICAN FUTURE TO YOU AND\nTO YOUR CHILDREN. DEMOCRATIC POLICIES HAVEN'T\nWORKED TO LIFT BLACK COMMUNITIES OUT OF POVERTY.\nIF HE CONTINUES ON THAT MESSAGE, I THINK HILLARY CLINTON'S\nCAMPAIGN WILL FOCUS ON PUSHING BACK AGAINST THAT BECAUSE THEY\nREALIZE THERE ARE SOME BLACK VOTERS WHO DEAL FEEL AS\nTHOUGH -- >> HOW DOES SHE COUNTER THAT?\n>> I THINK SHE HAS TO POINT TO WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS DONE TO\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS, WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT\nHE'S DONE AND TALKING ABOUT RACIAL TENSION IN THIS COUNTRY\nAND REALLY ADDRESSING THE ISSUES OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM AND\nPOLICE BRUTALITY. IF SHE CAN CONTINUE TO TALK POUT\nTHOSE MESSAGES, I THINK IT WILL COUNTER DONALD TRUMP.\nHE DOES HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET IN THERE AND TALK TO BLACK\nVOTERS ABOUT THE POLICIES THAT MAY NOT HAVE IMPROVED\nIMPOVERISHED COMMUNITIES AND INNER CITY COMMUNITIES OVER THE\nLAST SIX YEARS. >> PAUL, FINALLY HERE, WE'RE\nTALKING ABOUT AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS.\nWHAT ABOUT LATINO AMERICAN VOTERS.\nHE SAID HE REGRETS SOME OF THE THINGS HE SAID.\nTHAT CERTAINLY MIGHT BE THE SPACE HE WAS ALLUDING TO BECAUSE\nHE WAS NOT SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT MEXICANS AND\nMEXICAN AMERICANS. MIGHT THAT BE A SPACE HE'S GOING\nTO MOVE INTO NEXT WHERE HE'S GOING TO TRY TO REACH OUT AND\nREPAIR WHAT MANY HAVE SAID WAS AN ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE THING HE\nSAID ABOUT THAT COMMUNITY? >> HE'S GOING TO HAVE A LONG\nCLIMB IN THAT FRONT AS WELL. AGAIN, KEEP IN MIND, MITT ROMNEY\nTOOK 27% OF THE HISPANIC VOTE LAST TIME.\nDONALD TRUMP IS POLLING IN THE TENSE.\nHAVE YOU TO FIGURE WHAT CAN HE DO TO TURN TO THE LATINO\nCOMMUNITY AND SAY I BELIEVE IN YOU AND I BELIEVE AND SHARE THE\nSAME VALUES YOU SHARED AND WE'RE GOING TO WIN TOGETHER.\nWE HAVEN'T HEARD THAT AT ALL. IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN HOW HE\nADDRESSES THE FIRST QUESTION OUT OF THE BOX, HAVEN'T YOU\nBASICALLY BASED YOUR WHOLE CAMPAIGN ON BASHING MEXICO.\n>> THANK YOU SO MUCH I APPRECIATE THAT.\nTHANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR TIME THIS SATURDAY.\n>> THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU.\nNOW THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS RECEIVED HIS FIRST INTELLIGENCE\nBRIEFING, HOW WILL HIS NEW INSIGHT AFFECT CAMPAIGN\nRHETORIC? WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT WITH\nATLANTIC STEVEN CLEMMONS. DID A STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN\nRAISE SUSPICIONS ABOUT THE $400 MILLION PAYMENT TO IRAN?",

I'M TALKING ABOUT THE VENUES.\nAND WHAT CONCERN MUST MR. TRUMP PROVIDE CLEAR ANSWERS TO?\n>> WELL, HE CERTAINLY COULD START, ARTHEL, WITH TALKING WITH\nWHY HE QUESTIONED THE CITIZENSHIP OF THE FIRST\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT. WHY HE SUPPORTED IN HIS CAM PAIN\nTO GET THE NOMINATION. AND WHY WHEN HE WAS CAUGHT\nDISCRIMINATING AGAINST RENTING TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND SETTLED\nWITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, A FEW YEARS LATER, LOOKED AROUND\nAND THOUGHT NO ONE WAS WATCHING HIM AND SO HE THE SAME THING\nAGAIN. HE COULD START WITH THOSE\nANSWERS. IT'S VERY CLEAR I THINK TO\nANYONE LOOKING AT THIS, THIS IS NOT ABOUT AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nVOTERS. THIS IS ABOUT THE REPUBLICANS\nHE'S LOST.

IS IT WORKING?\n>> I THINK IT'S -- I THINK IT'S WORKING TO SOME EXTENT.\nIT'S PLAYING TO HIS STRENGTH. THERE IS A LOT OF UNREST AROUND\nTHE COUNTRY. THERE'S A LOT OF TENSION BETWEEN\nCOPS AND THESE MINORITY COMMUNITIES.\nYOU HAVE THE \"BLACK LIVES MATTER\" THROWING GAS ON THE\nFIRE. >> DAN, YOU THOUGHT THIS WAS A\nPLACE WHERE TRUMP CAN DRIVE A REAL SHARP DISTINCTION WITH\nDEMOCRATS WHO ARE AM BIF LENT WAS THE WORD YOU USED ABOUT\nANTI-CRIME POLICIES. >> I SAID HE WAS RUNNING A LAW\nAND ORDER CAMPAIGN HOME AND ABOARD.\nHIS ANTI-TERROR POLICIES ARE A LAW AND ORDER VERSION OF IT.\nTHE DEMOCRATS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AMBIVALENT.\nRICHARD NIXON RAN AGAINST HUMPHREY IN 1968.\nIN 2004 PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH RAISED THE ISSUE ON TERROR.\nTHE DEMOCRATS ALWAYS ARGUE THAT IN THE INNER CITIES LIKE\nMILWAUKEE OR BALTIMORE, THE POLICE ARE AT FAULT AS THE\nPEOPLE COMMITTING THE CRIMES. MOST AMERICANS DON'T BELIEVE\nTHAT AND TRUMP IS RAISING THAT ISSUE.\n>> HERE'S THE PROBLEM, JAMES. THE CRIME FIGURES ARE WAY DOWN.\nTHIS IS NOT 1968. IT IS -- THERE HAVE BEEN MURDER\nINCREASES IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS IN A LOT OF CITIES, NO\nQUESTION. AS FAR AS SOME GENERAL BROAD\nINCREASE IN CRIME, WE HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN IT.\n>> NO, BUT REMEMBER, A LOT OF THOSE GAINS ESPECIALLY IN A CITY\nLIKE NEW YORK FOR EXAMPLE, OCCURRED BECAUSE OF POLICING\nTACTICS LARGELY CONDEMNED BY DEMOCRATS LIKE HILLARY CLINTON.\nALSO, WHAT'S GIVING HIM THE POLITICAL OPENING IS THIS SORT\nOF WAR ON POLICE SINCE FERGUSON AND YOU HAVE SEEN LATELY\nALTHOUGH THERE'S STILL RELATIVELY LOW HISTORICALLY\nMURDER RATES COMING UP IN THE NATION'S LARGEST CITIES AND HE\nMADE A DISCIPLINED CASE TO SAY THIS MOST OF ALL HURTS THE BLACK\nCOMMUNITY AND THE PROBLEM IS NOT TOO MANY POLICE IT'S TOO FEW.\nPEOPLE NEED SAFETY IN URBAN NEIGHBORHOODS.\n>> WHAT ABOUT THIS REACHING OUT, KIM, TO THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nVOTE? WE HAVE BEEN ARGUING REPUBLICANS\nSHOULD DO THIS. HE'S TRYING TO DO THAT NOW.\nBUT THE POLLS SUGGEST SO FAR HE REALLY ISN'T DOING VERY WELL\nAMONG BLACK VOTERS. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE PITCH?\n>> WELL, THE UPSIDE IS HE'S GOT NOWHERE TO GO BUT UP BECAUSE AT\nTHE MOMENT BY SOME ESTIMATES HE'S GETTING ABOUT 1% OF THE\nBLACK VOTE. I THINK HE'S ALSO GOT A VERY\nSTRONG MESSAGE IN THAT WHAT HE'S -- HILLARY CLINTON IS\nFEEDING THIS NARRATIVE THIS IS TALKING ABOUT THESE OCCASIONAL\nSHOOTINGS. DONALD TRUMP WANTED TO TALK\nABOUT THE ROOT CAUSES, POVERTY AND CRIME IN INNER CITIES.\nHE TALKED ABOUT THE FAILINGS OF DOMESTIC POLICIES THAT DEMOCRATS\nPROMOTE ON EDUCATION AND OTHER ISSUES.\nMANUFACTURING POLICY. HE'S TRYING TO ACTUALLY GET TO\nTHE ROOT CAUSES. I THINK THE BIGGER QUESTION\nTHOUGH IS CAN YOU DO IT BY JUST GIVING A ONE-OFF SPEECH?\nYOU HAVE TO DO THIS IN A SUSTAINED MANNER.\nYOU ALSO HAVE TO DO WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN PAUL RYAN DOING WHICH\nIS MAKING ALLIANCES WITHIN FAITH-BASED COMMUNITIES,\nMINORITY COMMUNITIES WITHIN CITIES GOING AND VISITING AND\nSHOWING YOU'RE NOT JUST ASKING FOR A VOTE BUT YOU UNDERSTAND\nTHE PROBLEMS AND YOU'RE DEVOTED TO HAVING A COOPERATIVE\nRELATIONSHIP GOING FORWARD. >> NO OFFENSE TO WISCONSIN BUT\nIT'S NOT AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN AUDIENCE GOING TO MAKE THIS KIND\nOF PITCH, WHY NOT GO RIGHT THERE?\n>> EXACTLY.

THE GOP CANDIDATES MET WITH\nFLOOD VICTIMS, FAITH LEADERS AND MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL GUARD.\nTHEY GAVE OUT SUPPLIES TO MANY PEOPLE IN LEAD.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA HAS BEEN CRITICIZED BY SOME FOR NOT\nCUTTING HIS VACATION SHORT TO VISIT LOUISIANA.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE DID ANNOUNCE YESTERDAY THE PRESIDENT WILL GO\nTO THE FLOOD ZONE ON TUESDAY. THINK ABOUT THESE NUMBERS FOR A\nMOMENT. LOUISIANA HAS RECEIVED NEARL LY\nTRILLION GALLONS OF RAINFALL IN JUST A WEEK.\n13 PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN THE FLOODS.\nTENS OF THOUSANDS HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THEIR HOMES.\nDAMAGES, AT LEAST, AT LEAST REACHING $30 MILLION IF NOT FAR,\nFAR MORE. OUR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT IS\nWITH ME FROM ASCENSION PARISH. YOU HAVE 40,000 HOMES THAT HAVE\nBEEN DAMAGED AT LEAST. MANY WILL NOT BE RECOVERED.\nYOU HAVE ONLY 12% OF FOLKS WHO LIVE THERE THAT HAVE FLOOD\nINSURANCE.

IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.\n>> IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY. THAT IS HER MESSAGE TO NOT ONLY\nTHE REST OF HER COMMUNITY, HER NEIGHBORS, BUT ALSO THE REST OF\nTHE COUNTRY AS PEOPLE CONTINUE TO PICK UP THE PIECES.\nTHERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF HOPE HERE, BUT THERE IS A NEED FOR\nSUPPLIES. CLEANING SUPPLIES, WATER, FOOD,\nONE NATIONAL GUARDSMAN TOLD ME THAT THE DEMAND FOR FOOD AND\nWATER, THOSE KINDS OF THINGS, IS JUST AS GREAT AS WHAT WE SAW IN\nHURRICANE KATRINA. >> ABSOLUTELY.\nI'LL POINT PEOPLE TO IT IN A MOMENT, BUT AGAIN, WE HAVE WAYS\nYOU CAN HELP.  >> DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE\nCAME YESTERDAY, HANDED OUT SUPPLIES.\nTHEY HAD BEEN WARNED BY THE GOVERNOR DON'T JUST COME FOR A\nPHOTO OP.

DO THEY CARE ABOUT THE POLITICS\nOF IT? DO THEY WANT THE PRESIDENT\nTHERE? WHAT ARE THEY SAYING?\n>> YEAH, IT'S A GOOD QUESTION. YOU'LL FIND MIXED REACTION.\nTHERE ARE SOME INDIVIDUALS INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR WHO FEAR\nSOME OF THE VISITS COULD REMOVE SOME OF THESE RESOURCES.\nANYTIME YOU HAVE TO SECURE A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OR THE\nPRDZ HIMSELF, YES, THERE IS A DIVERSION OF SOME OF THESE\nRESOURCES. THEN YOU HAVE OTHERS WHO HAVE\nTOLD ME THEY WELCOME ANY OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MORE OF\nTHEIR STORIES AND ANYWHERE THE PRESIDENT GOES, THE SPOTLIGHT\nDOES FOLLOW HIM.

THE CDC ADVISING PREGNANT WOMEN\nTO AVOID AREAS OF MIAMI BEACH WHERE THEY FOUND THE VIRUS, ALSO\nTO CONSIDER POSTPONING ALL NONESSENTIAL VISITS TO ALL OF\nMIAMI-DADE COUNTY. THIS AFTER HEALTH OFFICIALS\nREPORTED NEW CASES OF NONTRAVEL RELATED ZIKA IN FLORIDA.\nTHAT MEANS LOCAL MOSQUITOES, NOT PEOPLE WHO FLEW IN AND GOT IT\nSOMEWHERE ELSE. WE KNOW A TOTAL OF 36 LOCALLY\nTRANSMITTED ZIKA CASES HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN THE CASE.\nELIZABETH COHEN IS IN MIAMI BEACH.\nLOOK, WHEN I HEARD THAT, FIRST OF ALL, I THOUGHT, WOW.\nI MEAN, SO MANY PEOPLE GO TO MIAMI.\nHUGE TOURIST DESTINATION. THE FACT THAT IT IS THERE AND\nWILL LIKELY SPREAD IS ONE THING. BUT SOMETHING THAT CONFUSED ME\nIS WHY THEY'RE ONLY SAYING AREAS OF MIAMI BEACH.\nBECAUSE IF THIS IS FROM MOSQUITOES, ARE THE MOSQUITOES\nREALLY JUST CONTAINED TO ONE PART?\n>> WELL, ACTUALLY, WHAT'S INTERESTING, POPPY, IS IT'S NOT\nSO MUCH THE MOSQUITOES WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT.\nIT'S THE COMBINATION OF MOSQUITOES AND PEOPLE.\nFOR ZIKA TO SPREAD LOCALLY HAS IT HAS HERE, MOSQUITO HAS TO\nBITE SOMEONE WITH ZIKA AND THEN HAS TO GO AND BITE SOMEONE ELSE.\nSO THESE MOSQUITOES, THEY DON'T FLY TOO, TOO FAR.\nTHEY MAYBE GO A COUPLE MILES. THE PROBLEM IS THAT PEOPLE GO\nVERY FAR. THE CONCERN IS THAT SOMEONE WITH\nZIKA MIGHT GO TO AN AREA. TO YOUR POINT, YES, I COMPLETELY\nHEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. THAT'S WHY MANY PEOPLE ARE\nSAYING WE'RE EXPECTING THIS COULD SPREAD EVEN FARTHER THAN\nIT'S ALREADY SPREAD. >> AND I THINK THE QUESTION\nALSO, ELIZABETH, ONE OF THE -- I WAS READING ABOUT SOME OF THE\nPEOPLE WHO CONTRACTED IT IN MIAMI.\nONE OF THEM ALREADY CAME UP HERE TO WHERE I AM IN NEW YORK.\nWHAT'S THE SAY THIS ISN'T JUST A RIPPLE EFFECT AND THERE ARE\nMULTIPLE CASES OF ZIKA IN GEORGIA, NEW YORK IN MINNESOTA,\nCALIFORNIA? WHAT'S YOUR OUTLOOK ON THAT?\n>> RIGHT. SO WE LIVE IN A HIGHLY MOBILE\nSOCIETY, ESPECIALLY HERE, BECAUSE AS YOU POINTED OUT, THIS\nSUCH A BIG TOURIST DESTINATION. WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER IS\nSOUTH FLORIDA IS REALLY SORT OF GROUND ZERO FOR ZIKA IN THE\nCONTINENTAL UNITED STATES. ARE THERE MOSQUITOES IN NEW YORK\nTHAT COULD SPREAD ZIKA? YEAH, THERE ARE, BUT NOT AS MANY\nAS SOUTH FLORIDA. ACTUALLY, SOMEONE GOING UP TO A\nCOLDER CLIMATE, IT'S LESS OF A THREAT.\n>> AND FINALLY, FOR PREGNANT WOMEN, WOMEN HEARING THIS AND\nTHEY'RE PREGNANT AND THINKING I WAS THERE LAST WEEKEND, WHAT DO\nTHEY DO? >> RIGHT, SO IF A WOMAN WAS HERE\nIN MIAMI LAST WEEKEND OR A COUPLE WEEKENDS AGO OR WHATEVER,\nAND THEN THEY GO BACK HOME AND WANT TO START A FAMILY, IT'S NOT\nREALLY A WORRY BECAUSE WHAT AUTHORITIES TELL ME IS OUR\nIMMUNE SYSTEM GETS RID OF ZIKA PRETTY EASILY.\nYOU GO HOME, WAIT MAYBE A MONTH AND YOU'RE FINE TO GET PREGNANT.\nIT'S THAT ACTUALLY IS A RE RELATIVELY EASY ISSUE TO\nRESOLVE. >> BUT WOMEN WHO ARE PREGNANT\nSHOULD OBVIOUSLY SEE THEIR HEALTH PROVIDER, RIGHT?\n>> RIGHT. EXACTLY.\nSO IF YOU ARE PREGNANT AND YOU WERE VISITING HERE IN MIAMI, YOU\nWOULD DEFINITELY WANT TO TELL YOUR DOCTOR, I WAS IN THE AREA\nTHEY HAVE DESCRIBED AS A ZIKA ZONE, AND THEY WOULD WANT TO\nKEEP AN EYE ON YOU.

THIS SUMMER IS RECORD TOURISM.\nCLEARLY, YOU KNOW, HAVING A FEW CASES OF ZIKA IS NOT GOOD FOR\nANYONE'S ECONOMY. BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING\nBESIDES BUSINESS AND TOURISM IS THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR\nRESIDENTS AND OUR TOURISTS. THAT'S WHAT I'M FOCUSED ON.\nTHAT'S WHAT WLUR CITY IS FOCUSED ON, EDUCATING OUR RESIDENTS AND\nTOURISTS, GETTING ALL OF THE WATER UP AND MAKE UR SURE PEOPLE\nWEAR ANTI-MOSQUITO REPELLANT. THAT'S PRIORITY NUMBER ONE.\n>> WHAT ABOUT SPRAYING AND APPLICATION OF PESTICIDE.\nARE YOU DOING THAT AS WELL? >> YES.\nSO THE COUNTRY OF DADE COUNTY ACTUALLY DOES THE SPRAYING,\nGOING TO LOCALIZED AREAS BETWEEN 8th AND 28th STREET.\nIT'S A VERY SMALL AREA. BUT WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS SINCE\nJANUARY. WE'VE BEEN PROGRESSIVE ON THIS.\nSINCE JANUARY WE'RE MAKING SURE THIS'S NO STANDING WATER.\nWE'RE GETTING RID OF CERTAIN PLANTS AND FOLIAGE WHERE\nMOSQUITO COULD BREED.

EVERYONE IS COMING TOGETHER.\n>> I WAS DOWN IN MIAMI, NOT MIAMI BEACH UNFORTUNATELY BUT\nMIAMI A FEW WEEKS AGO. I FOUND THAT PEOPLE ARE OUT AND\nABOUT AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE NOT OVERLY CONCERNED.\nA SIGNIFICANT POPULATION, SMALL, PREGNANT WOMEN THAT ARE.\n>> YES. I MEAN, MARTIN, OF COURSE,\nTHERE'S NOT A PANIC GOING ON HERE BY ANY MEANS.\nYOU CAN SEE THERE'S PEOPLE GOING BY, A SKATEBOARDER.\nTHERE'S A LOT HAPPENING. BUT WE CANNOT DOWNPLAY THIS.\nWE MUST FOCUS ON THIS AND ERADICATE THIS.\nI KNOW IF WE WORK TOGETHER AND GET THE GOVERNOR TO WORK WITH\nUS, WE CAN GET THIS DONE.

WE'RE REDUCING THAT RISK.\nWE'RE PICKING UP WATER BECAUSE WATER IS WHERE MOSQUITOS BREED.\nWE'RE SPRAYING AND TARGETED AREAS, BUT IT'S ALL ABOUT\nINFORMATION, RICHARD. AND I'M SORRY TO SAY THAT WE\nDIDN'T GET THE INFORMATION UNTIL LATE.\nOUR GOVERNOR DIDN'T WANT TO RELEASE THE INFORMATION, SO, ALL\nOF US IN THE CITY AND THE COUNTY, REALLY WERE IN THE DARK\nUNTIL THE GOVERNOR HAD HIS OWN PRESS CONFERENCE AND RELEASED IT\nTO EVERYBODY. AND I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU\nSOMETHING. YOU KNOW, NO ONE, NO ONE SHOULD\nPLAY POLITICS WITH PEOPLE'S LIVES.\n>> MAYOR, AS YOU HEARD, THERE COULD BE AREAS THAT ARE NOT YET\nRECOGNIZED OR WE DON'T HAVE DATA ON AS OF YET.\nHOW ARE YOU MONITORING THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION TO BE\nAHEAD OF THAT GAME? >> WELL SO RIGHT NOW THE STATE\nIS GOING IN AND DOING TESTING IN THAT ONE SPECIFIC AREA.\nTO MAKE SURE THAT THERE AREN'T OR MAY BE ADDITIONAL CASES.\nWE'RE GOING TO MONITOR AND WATCH THAT ALONG.\nOF COURSE, YOU KNOW, IT'S OUTSIDE OF MIAMI BEACH, IT'S IN\nOTHER",

THAT'S THE REASON HE SAYS HE\nWANTS TO SLOW DOWN HIS RACE CAREER AND CALL IT QUITS.\nIN TERMS OF MEN'S AND WOMEN'S 4x100 RELAYS LAST NIGHT YOU\nMENTIONED THE MEN'S HEARTBREAKING DECISION, BEING\nDISQUALIFIED THERE. THEY ARE STILL WAITING ON AN\nAPPEAL, PROBABLY UNLIKELY IT WILL GO IN THEIR FAVOR.\nCANADA WILL TAKE THE BRONZE. ALLYSON FELIX, HER INCREDIBLE\nFINISH. HOPEFULLY THIS ISN'T THE END OF\nHER CAREER WITH THIS WOMEN'S RELAY LAST NIGHT.\nTHEY ALMOST DIDN'T MAKE IT. SHE DROPPED THE BATON AFTER\nBEING INTERRUPTED THURSDAY IN THE QUALIFYING HEAT.\nTHEY HAD A CHANCE TO RUN THEIR RACE AGAIN IN FRONT OF NO ONE\nBASICALLY ON THE TRACK BUT THEM. THEY QUALIFIED ON TIME AND WON\nGOLD IN SPECTACULAR FASHION. JUST A GREAT NIGHT FOR TRACK AND\nFIELD FANS. >> EVERY DAY IS BETTER AND\nBETTER, RON. I'M WAITING FOR THAT INSTAGRAM\nOF YOU DOING THE USAIN BOLT POSE WITH HIM.\nI'M SURE IT'S COMING. NOT YET.\n>> MAYBE I CAN GET IT AT CLOSING CEREMONIES.\nWE'LL SEE. >> HE MADE SOME HISTORY.\nALSO SOME HISTORY YESTERDAY THE BRITISH FIELD HOCKEY PLAYERS.\nTALK ABOUT THAT. >> WE'VE GOT THESE TWO PLAYERS,\nOBVIOUSLY SAME-SEX MARRIAGE SPREAD AROUND THE WORLD WE'RE\nGOING TO SEE HEADLINES LIKE WE'RE SEEING TODAY.\nTHERE'S A MARRIED COUPLE THAT PLAYS FOR GREAT BRITAIN FIELD\nHOCKEY TEAM, THEY WERE IN A GOLD MEDAL MATCH LAST NIGHT AGAINST\nNETHERLANDS.

THEIR TEAMMATES RIB THEM A LOT\nWHEN THEY GET PHYSICAL ON THE FIELD AND ONE TACKLES THE OTHER\nONE HARD. THEY HAVE BEEN GENUINELY\nSUPPORTED BY THE COMMUNITY THERE IN GREAT BRITAIN AND THEY GET TO\nGO HOME BOTH BITING ON A GOLD MEDAL.\nIT'S A GREAT STORY.

WHAT'S BEING DONE TO STOP THE\nZIKA VIRUS FROM SPREADING IN SOUTH FLORIDA.\nCOURTING THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOEFT AFTER A CAMPAIGN STAFFING\nSHAKE-UP. CAN DONALD TRUMP GAIN ANY ANY\nGROUND THERE? >> I WILL INTRODUCE -- I WILL\nPRODUCE FOR THE INNER CITIES AND I WILL PRODUCE FOR THE\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS. >> WHY THE E-MAIL SERVER\nSITUATION WILL NOT GO AWAY FOR SECRETARY HILLARY CLINTON.\n>> ALL RIGHT. STARTING OFF THIS MORNING\nINTENSE EFFORT UNDER WAY TO SPRAY FOR MOSQUITOES AS THE ZIKA\nVIRUS SPREADS IN SOUTH FLORIDA. SEVEN NEW CASES HAVE TURNED UP\nIN MIAMI BEACH. TAMMY LEITNER IS THERE WATCHING\nIT FOR US. TAMMY, SOME NEW TRAVEL\nADVISORIES. THEY MAY BE AT ISSUE AS WELL.\nTHE CONCERN THAT MAY HAVE HAPPENED IN THE LAST 24 HOURS\nAFTER THE GOVERNOR THERE CAME OUT AND SAID WE'VE GOT MORE\nCASES. >> THAT'S RIGHT, RICHARD.\nGOOD MORNING. PREGNANT WOMEN AND THEIR\nPARTNERS ARE BEING WARNED NOT TO TRAVEL TO TWO SPECIFIC AREAS IN\nMIAMI-DADE COUNTY. WITH THAT SAID, IT'S VERY\nDIFFICULT TO DETECT THE SPREAD OF ZIKA, SO HEALTH OFFICIALS ARE\nSAYING IT COULD BE IN OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS IN MIAMI-DADE\nCOUNTY AS WELL. ONE BIG CONCERN AMONGST\nEVERYBODY HERE IS HOW THIS WILL AFFECT TOURISM IN THE AREA, AN\nAREA THAT RELIES SO HEAVILY ON TOURISM.\nTHIS IS WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAD TO SAY.\n>> WE BELIEVE WE HAVE A NEW AREA WHERE LOCAL TRANSMISSIONS ARE\nOCCURRING. TOURISM IS A DRIVING FORCE OF\nOUR ECONOMY. THIS INDUSTRY HAS FULL SUPPORT\nOF OUR STATE IN THE FIGHT AGAIN THE ZIKA VIRUS.\n>> FIVE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INFECTED, FIVE NEW CASES.\n2011 THEM ARE LOCAL RESIDENTS, THREE OF THEM ARE TOURISTS, ONE\nFROM NEW YORK, ONE FROM TEXAS AND ONE FROM TAIWAN.\nRICHARD. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH, TAMMY.\nOBVIOUSLY A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT THOSE LOCALLY TRANSPORTED CASES\nOF ZIKA.

THE TEAM WON A TIME OF ABOUT 41\nSECONDS. NBC'S RON MOTT IS IN RIO.\nHE JOINS US RIGHT NOW. HE'S ALMOST AS FAST AS THEY ARE.\nALMOST. ANOTHER EXCITING WIN HERE, RON,\nFOR THE UNITED STATES. HOW DID THE DEEM FEEL ABOUT THAT\nONE? >> EXHILARATING RACE 4x100\nBECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED THE DAY BEFORE.\nYOU REMEMBER, RICHARD, THEY DROPPED THE BATON IN THE\nQUALIFYING HEAT. IT WAS RULED ALLYSON FELIX WAS\nINTERRUPTED. THEY WERE ABLE TO RUN AGAIN,\nWENT OUT AND DEFENDED THEIR GOLD MEDAL LAST NIGHT.\nFOR THE MEN'S, THIS IS HEARTBREAK.\nTHERE'S A SLAM CHANCE THERE MIGHT BE AN OVERRULING OF THIS\nAPPEAL AND REAWARD THE BRONZE MEDAL TO THEM.\nTHEY RAN THEIR HEARTS OUT. I CAUGHT UP WITH JUSTIN GATLIN\nPART OF THE EXCHANGE THE JUDGE RULED WAS OUT-OF-BOUNDS.\nHERE IS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY AFTER THE RACE.\n>> WHEN THEY SAY THE EXCHANGE WAS PASSED A LITTLE TOO EARLY\nBEFORE THE FIRST EXCHANGE, WHEN I REVIEWED THE TAKE IT LOOKED\nLIKE I HAD FULL CONTROL GOING INTO THE ZONE.\nSHOULD BE ABLE TO PROTEST IT. THE GUYS WEN OUT, PRACTICED VERY\nHARD, LADIES PRACTICED VERY HARD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH US.\nTHEY CAME OUT ON TOP. WE THOUGHT WE HAD A MEDAL.\nI'M PROUD OF MY TEAM. >> IF THIS HOLDS, THAT WOULD\nMEAN THE DROUGHT HAS EXTENDED FOR THE THIRD STRAIGHT OLYMPICS\nMEN'S U.S. 4x100 TEAM HAS NOT MEDALED SINCE 2004.\nTHEY HAVE NOT WON SINCE 2000 IN SYDNEY.\nYESTERDAY WAS A GREAT RETURN TO FORM FOR THIS TEAM BUT NOT THE\nENDING THEY WERE LOOKING FOR. AGAIN, AS WE SEIYA SLIM CHANCE\nTHE RULING MIGHT BE OVERTURNED ON APPEAL BUT PROBABLY NOT.\nRICHARD. >> ROB, WHAT YOU ELICITED,\nSPORTSMAN LEAK CONDUCT HE HAD. THAT'S THE WAY WE'LL LOOK AT, IF\nHOPEFUL. MORE QUESTIONS AROUND IT, THAT\nRIGHT NOW, RYAN LOCHTE AND THE INCIDENT AT THE GAS STATION.\n>> WELL, HE ISSUED HIS APOLOGY FRIDAY ON SOCIAL MEDIA,\nAPOLOGIZED FOR WHAT HE SAID WAS HIS LACK OF CANDOR IN EXPLAINING\nTHE EVENTS OF THAT NIGHT.

IT WAS MY IMMATURE BEHAVIOR.\n>> THAT'S JUST PART OF THE INTERVIEW.\nLET'S BRING IN CNN'S SPORTS ANALYST, \"USA TODAY\" SPORTS\nCOLUMNIST CHRISTINE BRENNAN FROM RIO.\nCHRISTINE, IS THAT TAKING FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT?\n>> Reporter: WELL, IT'S CERTAINLY A START.\nI'M GLAD, I THINK EVERYONE IS GLAD TO HEAR FROM RYAN LOCHTE,\nAND YOU HEARD HIM SAY THAT HE UNDERSTANDS THAT IF HE HAD NOT\nSAID THE THINGS HE SAID, THAT WE WOULDN'T BE IN THIS PLACE,\nESPECIALLY THE THREE TEAMMATES OF HIS WHO WENT THROUGH SUCH AN\nORDEAL THAT CLEARLY WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY IF\nRYAN HAD DONE THE RIGHT THING FROM THE GET-GO.\nTHIS IS SMART, ALSO IT'S PUBLIC RELATIONS, OF COURSE, LET'S JUST\nBE HONEST ABOUT THAT. HE IS CLEARLY BEING ADVISED, AND\nHE REALIZES THAT THE SILENCE FOR FIVE DAYS WAS DEVASTATING AS\nEVENTS UNFOLDED IN RIO AND HE OF COURSE WAS BACK SAFELY AT HOME,\nALL THE REMNANTS OF THIS DRUNKEN RAMPAGE AND RIDICULOUS FIASCO\nWERE PLAYING OUT, AND HE WAS REALLY NOT SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT\nIT. >> WE KNOW HE CERTAINLY WAS\nADVISED, NOT ONLY ADVISED BUT ADVISED BY ONE OF THE BEST\nCRISIS PR MANAGERS IN THE BUSINESS, MATTHEW HILTIG.\nHE DIDN'T JUST GIVE THAT INTERVIEW TO NBC.\nHE GAVE A SECOND INTERVIEW TO GLOBAL TELEVISION, BRAZILIAN\nTELEVISION NETWORK, IN AN EFFORT TO DIRECTLY APOLOGIZE TO THE\nPEOPLE OF BRAZIL. HOW IMPORTANT DO YOU THINK THAT\nIS? >> Reporter: OH, I THINK THAT'S\nHUGE, POPPY. BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW AND SO MANY\nPEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS STORY NOW, THE NARRATIVE\nHAS ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT THE CONCERNS ABOUT BRAZILIAN STREET\nCRIME. AND WHEN ALMOST A WEEK AGO NOW,\nWHEN WE FIRST HEARD THE NEWS THAT RYAN LOCHTE SAID THAT HE\nHAD A GUN PUT TO HIS FOREHEAD, IT PLAYED INTO EVERY STEREOTYPE\nAND CONCERN THAT PEOPLE HAD FROM AROUND THE WORLD WHO COME TO RIO\nFOR THESE OLYMPIC GAMES. WE KNOW OF COURSE THAT THAT\nSTORY WAS AT LEAST PARTIALLY FABRICATED, AND NOW RYAN IS\nTELLING ANOTHER STORY. SO YES, I THINK IT'S FANTASTIC\nTHAT HE HAS MADE THE DECISION TO SPEAK TO THE PEOPLE OF RIO,\nBECAUSE THEY WERE SO AFFECTED BY THE STORY THAT HE MADE UP.\n>> LET'S GET TO THE CONSEQUENCES HERE.\nYOUR SOURCES TELLING YOU THAT HE WILL INDEED BE SUSPENDED.\nI MEAN, FOR HOW LONG, WHAT IS THE PUNISHMENT GOING TO LOOK\nLIKE? >> Reporter: AS YOU MAY HAVE\nHEARD, AS REPORTED EARLIER TODAY, THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC\nCOMMITTEE IS NOW SETTING UP A COMMISSION TO LOOK INTO THIS.\nWHAT I THINK THAT DOES, POPPY, IS ELONGATES THE CONVERSATION.\nTHE U.S. OLYMPIC COMMITTEE WILL BE PLAYING A BIG ROLE.\nUSA SWIMMING, THE NATIONAL GOVERNING BODY TO THE SPORT, IS\nGOING TO BE PLAYING A BIG ROLE IN THIS.\nAND NOW THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE.\nWHO KNOWS WHO WILL GO FIRST, ALTHOUGH I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED\nIF IT'S USA SWIMMING IN TERMS OF PUNISHMENT BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN\nSO NO-NONSENSE ON MICHAEL PHELPS AND OTHERS OVER THE YEARS.\nTHIS MAY BE MORE ELONGATED THAN WE THOUGHT.\nA DECISION MAY NOT COME IN THE NEXT WEEK OR TWO JUST BECAUSE SO\nMANY PEOPLE ARE NOW LOOKING AT THESE FOUR SWIMMERS, ESPECIALLY\nLOCHTE, AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PUNISH THEM.\n>> CHRISTINE, LOCHTE IS 32, HE'S CLOSER TO THE END OF HIS CAREER\nTHAN THE OTHER THREE SWIMMERS THAT WERE WITH HIM THAT ARE MUCH\nYOUNGER. WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR THEM?\n>> Reporter: FOR THEM, LET'S SAY THEY'RE SUSPENDED, AND I DON'T\nTHINK WHAT THE LENGTH WOULD BE, OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE\nNONE OF THIS HAS HAPPENED YET. LET'S SAY MICHAEL PHELPS IS\nSUSPENDED FOR SIX MONTHS FOR DRUNK DRIVING, THEY MAY STILL BE\nBACK FOR THE NEXT OLYMPIC GAMES. RYAN LOCHTE, IT'S HARD TO\nIMAGINE HIM AT AGE 36 COMING BACK TO THE OLYMPIC GAMES.\nI THINK HE WOULD ALSO GET A BIGGER SUSPENSION SIMPLY BECAUSE\nHE WAS CLEARLY THE RINGLEADER, AND FROM THE STORIES THE OTHERS\nTOLD, IT SOUNDS LIKE LOCHTE MISBEHAVED IN WAYS THAT WERE\nPARTICULARLY EMBARRASSING TO THE OLYMPIC COMMITTEE AS A\nREPRESENTATIVE OF OUR NATION AS AN ATHLETE AT THESE GAMES.\n>> CHRISTINE BRENNAN, PHENOMENAL REPORTING ALL WEEK ON THIS.\nAND THE ACTUAL GAMES AND THE WONDERFUL THINGS OUT OF THE\nOLYMPICS THAT MATTER THE MOST. CHRISTINE BRENNAN FOR US FROM\nRIO TONIGHT, THANK YOU SO MUCH.",

SO HOPEFULLY.\nOUR THOUGHTS FOR THE FUTURE HERE FOR LOCHTE AND THE SWIMMERS, A\nSPORTS AGENT IS WITH ME, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH ME,\nSIR. WE HAD YOU ON THE PROGRAM\nYESTERDAY MORNING. YOU TOOK A CONTRARIAN POINT OF\nVIEW FROM CHRISTINE BRENNAN, LOCHTE HAS COME OUT FOR THIS\nAPOLOGIZED FOR HIS BEHAVIOR. SOME SEE IT AS A BIT OF A HALF\nHEARTED APOLOGY. HOW DO YOU READ IT?\nDOES IT CHANGE ANYTHING FOR HIS FUTURE?\n>> I THINK WE AGREED ON A COUPLE OF POINTS.\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT RYAN'S APOLOGY, WE UNDERSTAND HE WILL HAVE A\nSIT-DOWN INTERVIEW WITH MATT LAUER.\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT THE INITIAL PART OF HIS APOLOGY, ESPECIALLY\nIN JUXTAPOSITIONS, BOTH COME OUT AND ISSUED A FORMER STATEMENT.\nRYAN IS RATHER LACKING BOTH IN TERMS OF SUBSTANCE AND STYLE.\nHERE'S WHY. GUNNAR AND CONGER, BOTH NUMBER\nONE APOLOGIZED. NUMBER TWO, SAID THEY WERE NEVER\nA SUSPECT. ONLY A WITNESS AND NUMBER THREE,\nIDENTIFIED THEY NEVER PROVIDED MISLEADING STATEMENTS.\nTHE FIRST TWO ARE IMPORTANT IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION THE\nLATTER IN LAW. IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE\nHOW PART TWO SO TO SPEAK PLAYS OUT MOVING FORWARD.\n>> I THINK IT'S INTERESTING THE POLICE IF RIO SAID LOOK YOU NEED\nTO APOLOGIZE TO THE PEOPLE OF RIO, THE SMEAR THIS HAS LEFT ON\nOUR CITY IN THE EYES OF THE WORLD.\nAND CHRISTINE BRENNAN, OUR SPORTS ANALYST POINTED OUT RYAN\nLOCHTE DID A LENGTHY STATEMENT AND APOLOGY, HE FIRST APOLOGIZED\nTO HIS SPONSORS BEFORE ANYONE ELSE.\n>> RIGHT. THERE'S PROBABLY A LITTLE\nSEMANTICS THERE. I THINK THERE IS NO QUESTION HE\nSHOULD HAVE IDENTIFIED RESPONSIBILITY, CULPABILITY AND\nMOST ASSUREDLY REMORSE FOR A VARIETY OF THINGS, NOP THE LEAST\nOF WHICH IS THE FOCUS THIS HAS PUT ON THE PEOPLE OFRYIO.\nI THINK SALLY JENKINS POINTED OUT A COUPLE INTERESTING FACTS\nTHAT PUT THIS INTO CONTEXT. NUMBER ONE IN THE MONTH OF JUNE\nIN RIO. THERE WERE 11,000 VIOLENT\nCRIMES. NUMBER TWO, THE UNEMPLOYMENT\nRATE IS AROUND 11% AND NUMBER THREE, THE MEDIAN MINIMUM WAGE\nPER MONTH IS AROUND $228. ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT A COUNTRY\nREELING ECONOMICALLY AND A SPIRIT STAND.SO FOR THEM, THIS\nWAS AN ABSOLUTE PR BLACK EYE THAT JUST REALLY HEIGHTENS THE\nNEGATIVITY AND THE GLOBAL IMPETUS --\n>> BECAUSE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. >> YES.\nMY POINT INSURING ABOUT SALLY, I THINK SALLY IS A FANTASTIC\nJOURNALIST. SHE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE\nCONTEXT THAT REALLY UNDERSCORED AND VALIDED THE BRAZILIAN FERVOR\nAROUND THE SITUATION. TO PIVOT AND LOOK AT LOCHTE'S\nNEXT STEPS. THE TEAM AROUND HIM THE TEAM,\nFIRST AND FOREMOST THE U.S. OLYMPIC TEAM.\nSCOTT BLACKMAN ON DOWN THEY DON'T COME FINER THAN TEAM USA.\nNUMBER TWO, USA SWIMMING. HE IS AT COLORADO USA SWIMMING,\nTHEY ARE NOT ONLY HOLDING THEIR ATHLETES ACCOUNTABLE BUT\nPROMOTING THE GOOD DEEDS OF THOSE THAT CARRY THE FLAG AND\nEMBODY THE OLYMPIC SPIRIT. RYAN WILL HAVE CONSEQUENCE TO\nATONE FOR AND STRATEGICALLY I THINK IT WOULD BE IN HIS BEST\nINTEREST NOT TO FIGHT THE PUN IBMENT ALBEIT FROM A LIFETIME\nDOWN. >> IF YOU WERE HIS AGENT.\nARE YOU NOT. IF YOU WERE ADVISING HIM ON THIS\nINTERVIEW, WHAT SHOULD HE SAY FIRST?\n>> AT THIS POINT, POPPY, IT'S BRUTAL HONESTY.\nFIRST OF ALL, ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HE MADE AN ERROR, NOT ONLY IN\nACTION, BUT ARGUABLY MORE IMPORTANTLY IN THE SUBSEQUENT\nDAYS HOW IT WAS HANDLED. AS ALL OF OUR MOMS TO HIM US THE\nCOVERUP IS WORSE THAN THE CRIME. I THINK IN SO MANY WAYS, THIS IS\nWHAT WE WERE LOOKING AT HERE. IT WASN'T THE INITIAL ACTION.\nCHRISTINE AGREED YESTERDAY THE ACTION WAS INDEFENSIBLE.\nBUT IT WAS HOW THIS HANDLED IN THE DAYS FOLLOWED THAT DREW THE\nIRE AND GLOBAL ATTENTION. INSOFAR AS STRATEGY MOVING\nFORWARD, YOU GOT A GREAT SOUNDING BOARD ON MATT LAUER.\nSPEAK HONESTLY AND FROM THE HEART.\nTHIS NEEDS TO BE AS MUCH AS IT CAN BE OUTSIDE THE OBVIOUS LEGAL\nHURDLE HE WILL HAVE TO NAVIGATE IN THE WEEKS AND DAYS AHEAD.\nTHIS NEEDS TO BE SINCERE, TO MATCH IN SUBSTANCE AS MUCH AS IT\nDOES IN STYLE. LEAD WITH AN APOLOGY, AN\nAPOLOGY, PREMISE AND ACCOUNTABLY.\nRIGHT. UNTIL YOU ACKNOWLEDGE\nACCOUNTABILITY AND WRONG DOING, YOU CAN'T MOVE FORWARD.\n>> MAYBE NO, I'M SORRY, BUT. >> EXACTLY.\nTHERE SHOULD BE NO BUTs OR ASTERISKS.\nTHERE SHOULD BE NO COMMENTS, A SIMPLEKABILITY.\nI THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT.\nYOU SAID I WAS CONTRAMPBLT I WOULD SAY OBJECTIVE MORE THAN\nCONTRARIAN. I'D SAY IT'S PROBABLY IMPORTANT\nFOR US TO ACT KNOWLEDGE SOMETIMES THERE IS A FINE LINE\nBETWEEN DEMANDING ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONTRITION AND DEMANDING A\nPOUND OF FLEMPBLT AT WHAT POINT WOULD RYAN HAVE TO HAVE DONE\nENOUGH FOR HIS MISGIVINGS? A SIMPLE APOLOGY IS NOT ENOUGH.\nIT'S MOST ASSUREDLY THE FIRST STEP.\nIT WILL BE HOW HE SERVES AS A ROLE MODEL AND A MENTOR FOR\nSTUDENT ATHLETES, THAT WILL ULTIMATELY BE THE MOST IMPORTANT\nSTEP. >> I'M GETTING THE WRAP.\nTHANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. WE WILL TALK ABOUT IT AT 7:00\nEASTERN. WILL YOU HEAR FROM RYAN LOCHTE\nSPEAKING OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HIS STORY HIT THE\nHEADLINES.",

ARMED SECURITY GUARDS\nSURROUNDING THEM FALSELY IMPRISONED THEM, POINTED A\nFIREARM AT THEIR HEAD. THAT'S ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY\nWEAPON AND EXTORTED THEM FOR $400 SO THEY COULD LEAVE.\nNOW APPARENTLY IN BRAZIL THAT'S PROPER PROCEDURE AND EVERYBODY\nIS ACCEPTING THAT.

IN THE U.S., FROM OUR\nPERSPECTIVE, IF YOU TAKE THE GUNS THAT WE NOW NOW WERE\nDISPLAYED. THEY WERE POINTED AND WE KNOW\nTHESE SECURITY GUARDS OR WHATEVER THEY WERE SAID YOU'RE\nGOING TO HAVE TO GIVE US MONEY BEFORE YOU CAN LEAVE.\nIN THIS COUNTRY, THAT WOULD AT A MINIMUM BE ARMED ROBBERY, IF NOT\nFALSE IMPRISONMENT.

GOLD MEDALIST RYAN LOCHTE AND\nOTHER SWIMMERS SAID THEY WERE PULLED OVER BY A TAXI AND ROBBED\nAT GUNPOINT BY MEN DRESSED AS POLICE.\nBUT AS THE WEEK WENT ON, THEY BECAME THE UGLY AMERICAN\nSTEREOTYPES. BUT NOW ONE OF THE SWIMMERS\nGUNNAR BENTZ RELEASED THE ACCOUNT AND MAKES ME MORE\nSYMPATHETIC TO THE MEN. JOINING ME IS CNN LEGAL ANALYST\nDANNY SAVALOS. LET ME MENTION TO YOU, THEY WERE\nHAMMERED AND WERE STUPID TEARING DOWN A SIGN, BUT THEY DIDN'T DO\nANYTHING TO WARRANT THE DRAWING OF WEAPONS ON THEM.\nAND WHY WERE THEY PAYING CASH OUTSIDE THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM TO\nBE LET GO? >> YEAH, THIS STATEMENT, FIRST\nOF ALL, IS BRILLIANTLY CRAFTED. CERTAINLY A TEAM OF PR AND\nLAWYERS WERE INVOLVED BECAUSE IT REALLY IS A VERY, VERY GOOD\nSTATEMENT. AND ITS OBVIOUSLY SERVING THE\nSWIMMERS' INTERESTS. BUT I'VE BEEN SAYING THIS FROM\nTHE BEGINNING, THAT THE PROBLEM I HAD WITH BRAZILIAN AUTHORITIES\nHOLDING A PRESS CONFERENCE AND SAYING THESE MEN WERE NOT ROBBED\nAND THEN IN THE SAME BREATH THEY SAY, WHAT HAPPENED MAY HAVE BEEN\nTHAT SOMEBODY POINTED A GUN AT THEM AND DEMANDED MONEY.\nWELL, THAT IS ROBBERY. AND THIS STATEMENT ALSO LOCKS IN\nTHAT LOCHTE MAY HAVE RIPPED DOWN A SIGN, BUT IF YOU READ THE\nSTATEMENT, THEN TWO GUNS ARE DRAWN ON THEM, THEN THEY ARE\nMADE TO SIT DOWN ON THE SIDEWALK WITH THEIR HANDS UP, WE SAW THAT\nFROM THE VIDEO, AND THEN THEREAFTER LOCHTE GETS INTO A\nSHOUTING MATCH WITH THE GUARDS. WHICH DOESN'T LOOK GOOD FOR\nLOCHTE IN TERMS OF POOR BEHAVIOR.\nBUT IN TERMS OF A ROBBERY OR SOME SORT OF EXHORTATION OF\nFORCE, IT DOESN'T LOOK VERY GOOD FOR THE SECURITY GUARDS, UNLESS,\nOF COURSE, THIS IS A LEGAL COMMON PRACTICE IN BRAZIL.\nIF YOU BELIEVE SOMEBODY OWES YOU MONEY AND THEN YOU CAN POINT A\nGUN AT THEM, I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE.\nI'M NOT ADMITTED TO THE BRAZILIAN BAR.\nBUT HERE IN AMERICA THAT IS WHAT WE CALL ROBBERY.\nAND IT IS PROBABLY EVEN KIDNAPPING.\n>> IT SEEMS LIKE THEY ACTED, THE SWIMMERS, IN AN ASININE FACTION,\nBUT WHERE DO THEY GO TO GET THEIR REPUTATION BACK.\nIT MAY NOT BE AS BAD AS WE OFFICIALLY FEARED.\nAND I FEEL MANY AMERICANS HAVE MOVED ON FROM THE STORY.\nANY CHANCE THAT MY OF THEM HAVE TO GO BACK OR HAS IT RUN THE\nPROCESS IN THAT COUNTRY? >> THIS STORY CHANGED SO MANY\nTIMES OVER THE COURSE OF THE WEEK.\nIF I WERE TO CHART THE LIKELIHOOD OF AN EXTRADITION OF\nANY OF THE SWIMMERS BACK FROM THE UNITED STATES TO BRAZIL, IT\nWOULD BE A CHANCE VANISHING AND GOING DOWN VERY QUICKLY.\nI WOULD SAY THEY ARE APPROACHING ZERO NOW.\nAND THE ONLY PERSON BRAZIL COULD POSSIBLY BE INTERESTED IN AT\nTHIS POINT WOULD BE RYAN LOCHTE. BUT I HAVE TO SAY, IT DOESN'T\nSEEM LIKELY. AND THEN BASED ON THE\nEXTRADITION TREATY OF THE UNITED STATES WITH BRAZIL, SIMPLE\nVANDALISM IS PROBABLY NOT WITHIN THE LIST OF EXTRADITABLE\nOFFENSES. AND NOR IS GIVING A FALSE\nSTATEMENT TO POLICE. ALTHOUGH OTHER SIMILAR CRIMES\nMIGHT MEET THE DESCRIPTION, IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM LIKELY THAT\nTHIS WOULD BE CONSIDERED AN EXTRADITABLE OFFENSE BY THE\nU.S., SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO RETURN LOCHTE EVEN IF BRAZILIAN\nAUTHORITIES CHOSE TO CHARGE HIM. >> ONE FINAL OBSERVATION.\nTHE STATEMENT WE BOTH READ ALSO SUGGESTS THAT THERE ARE PERHAPS\nOTHER SO PERHAPS THERE'S MORE TO COME?\n>> YOU KNOW, MICHAEL, THE THING ABOUT THIS STORY IS IN THE LAST\nWEEK IT'S AS IF NOBODY'S HEARD OF ANYBODY GIVING STATEMENTS\nTHAT SLANT TO THEIR OWN BEST INTEREST.\nANYONE WHO DOES ANY AMOUNT OF LITIGATION, CRIMINAL OR CIVIL\nWOULDN'T BE SURPRISED THAT ONE SIDE, THE BRAZILIAN SIDE THAT\nEMERGED FAVORED THE BRAZILIAN STORY.\nNOW HERE'S A GOOD STATEMENT FROM ONE OF THE SWIMMERS THAT HAPPENS\nTO FAVOR THAT PARTICULAR SWIMMER'S INTEREST.\nIT'S NOT NECESSARILY LYING. WE ALL SPIN OUR STORIES, EVEN\nUNCONSCIOUSLY FOR SELF-PRESERVATION.\nTHIS IS NO EXCEPTION. WE MAY NEVER FIND THE TRUTH.\nMAYBE IT LIES SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN.\nBUT WE SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED THAT THESE TWO STORIES ARE AT\nPOLAR OPPOSITES. >> MORE TO COME, PERHAPS.\nDA EXCELLENT JOB.\nTHANK YOU FOR THAT.",

AND IT BECOMES A BIG DEAL.\nUNTIL BRAZILIAN POLICE SAID NO, THAT'S NOT THE WHOLE STORY AND\nRELEASED SOME TAPE. HERE'S RYAN AND HIS FELLOW FISH\nAT THE GAS STATION BATHROOM, MY USUAL HAUNT, WHERE POLICE SAY\nTHEY VANDALIZED THE JOHN AND WERE INTOXICATED.\nTHOSE DETAILS, IF TRUE, WEREN'T REVEALED BY RYAN ORIGINALLY.\n USED THE GUNS TO CONTROL THE ATHLETES\nAND TOOK MONEY TO COVER THE COST OF THE BATHROOM DAMAGE.\nI HAVE BEEN THERE, TOO. LYIN' RYAN STICKING TO THE STORY\nTHAT SOMEONE POINTED A GUN AT HIM AND DEMANDED MONEY.\nWAS IT ROBBERY, A SHAKE-DOWN, A LANGUAGE BARRIER?\nI DON'T KNOW. BUT I KNOW THIS.\nTELL YOUR MOTHER THE WHOLE TRUTH BECAUSE MOM'S PROUD OF YOU AND\nSHE'S GOING TO TALK. ALL RIGHT.\nQUICKLY, START WITH YOU. WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED?\n>> I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED.\nI THINK THE MORE BELIEVABLE LIE HERE WOULD BE THIS DYE JOB WAS\nDONE AT GUN POINT. BECAUSE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE SAID\nALL RIGHT, THAT CHECKS OUT. THAT SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.\n>> WHAT DO YOU THINK? I DON'T WATCH THE OLYMPICS\nBECAUSE THERE ARE TOO MANY YOUNG BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE.\nTHAT DEPRESSES ME. I PREFER TO WORK IN CABLE NEWS.\nIN OLYMPICS, THAT WOULD BE A 1. IN CABLE NEWS, I'M LIKE A 7.\nANYWAY -- THAT WASN'T A QUESTION.\n>> NO, LOOK IT WAS BAD BUT NOT AS BAD AS MICHAEL PHELPS BECAUSE\nTHEY WERE DRUNK AND THEY VANDALIZED SOMETHING AND THEN\nTHEY MADE FALSE ACCUSATIONS THAT EMBARRASSED THE COUNTRY.\nBUT MICHAEL PHELPS WAS ON THE WEED AND WE ALL KNOW HOW MUCH\nTHAT HURTS PEOPLE. >> YEAH.\n>> WAY MORE. >> DRUNKEN URINATING IN PUBLIC,\nTHAT'S OKAY. >> THE WEED, THOUGH, RUINS NOT\nJUST YOUR LIFE BUT EVERYONE'S LIVES.\n>> JOEY? >> RYAN LOCHTE IS THE KIND OF\nBRO THAT MAKES RUGGEDLY HANDSOME 30 YEAR OLDS LIKE MYSELF LOOK\nHORRIBLE. ALL WE KNOW IS RYAN'S MOM CAME\nOUT WITH THIS FIRST AND IF HE WERE GOOD AT LYING AT ALL IT\nWOULD BE A COVERUP TO PROTECT HIS MOM.\nIF HIS MOM'S LIKE MINE SHE WILL MAKE IT UP ALONG THE WAY ANYWAY.\n>> THAT'S TRUE. >> THEN WHAT KIND OF SWEETHEART\nWOULD HE BE? >> SO TRUE.\nKENNEDY, YOU DO FEEL BAD FOR RYAN?\n>> I DON'T FEEL BAD FOR HIM AT ALL.\nI'M VERY RESENTFUL TOWARD HIM BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN -- I AM A\nPATRIOT, PEOPLE. IT'S LIKE IT'S HARD.\nI LOVE THIS COUNTRY SO MUCH, I LOVE THE OLYMPICS AND I LOVE\nSEEING TEAM USA DO STUNNINGLY WELL AT SO MANY EVENTS.\nTHE U.S. SWEPT THE PODIUM AND THE WOMEN'S EVENT AND THERE ARE\nSO MANY INCREDIBLE ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT I HOPE\nPEOPLE TAKE AWAY FROM THIS.

TYRUS, YOU ARE SHAKING YOUR\nHEAD. >> I AM SO DISGUSTED.\nFIRST OF ALL, YOUR MOM TELLS ON YOU TO THE PRESS?\nTHIS IS MOMENTS WHERE I'M GLAD I DIDN'T HAVE PARENTS.\nTHAT IS DISGUSTING. HEY, MOM, THIS HAPPENED.\nOH, REALLY, HOLD ON. ABOVE THAT, LISTEN, I GREW UP IN\nCALIFORNIA. ME AND MY BUDDIES -- OH, HEY.\nHOW DID YOU GET HERE? ME AND MY BUDDIES GO DOWN TO A\nLITTLE PLACE CALLED TIJUANA ON THE WEEKENDS.\nROBBERY'S AN UGLY WORD IN BRAZIL AND IN TIJUANA.\nTHEY PREFER EXTORTION. I WENT THROUGH THIS, I WALKED\nOUT, THEY PULL GUNS ON YOU, LET YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT A DRILL.\nOF COURSE, WE ARE GOING TO FREEZE.\nTHREE YOUNG GUYS HAVE BEEN DRINKING WHO DON'T WANT TO GET\nIN TROUBLE, HAVE A TON OF THINGS TO LOSE AND THEY SAY LISTEN, WE\nWILL TAKE YOU DOWN, PROCESS YOU, YOU WILL BE IN THE PAPER BECAUSE\nYOU DEFAMED OUR BATHROOM WHICH HAPPENED TO BE A NATIONAL\nTREASURE, AND IF YOU SETTLE OUT OF COURT FOR SAY HOW MUCH YOU\nHAVE IN YOUR WALLET, WE CAN LET YOU GO.\nTHAT'S ROBBERY. THE POLICE WERE IT'S NOT\nROBBERY. THEY GAVE MONEY TO GUYS WITH\nGUNS, NO MATTER HOW THEY'RE DRESSED, IT'S ROBBERY.\nYOU WANT TO BE COOL ABOUT IT, WE CALL IT HASH TAG EXTORTION, HASH\nTAG MAMA HAS A BIG MOUTH, HASH TAG OLYMPICS SHOULD NOT HAVE\nBEEN IN BRAZIL ANYWAY. >> I WANT TO MOVE TO ANOTHER\nOLYMPIC STORY BRIEFLY.

I WANTED TO SHARE THE ONE\nOLYMPIC STORY NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT AND PROBABLY FOR VERY GOOD\nREASON. IT INVOLVES RACE WALKING AND\nSOILING YOUR SHORTS.

THAT IS THE TRUE DEFINITION OF\nCOMMITMENT AND HE IS MY HERO. ALL RIGHT.\nYEAH. YEAH.\nYEAH. I KNEW THAT WOULD SILENCE YOU.\nALL RIGHT. >> HE'S FROM BRAZIL, WHAT DO YOU\nEXPECT?

HE WILL NOT COME BACK.\nYOU SAW IT IN THE OLYMPICS. HIS PERFORMANCE WAS AVERAGE AT\nBEST. NUMBER TWO, HE DIDN'T JUST SULLY\nHIMSELF LIKE A TIGER WOODS, HE SULLIED A COUNTRY.\nPEOPLE ARE A LITTLE LESS FORGIVING FOR THAT.\nNUMBER THREE, HE MADE THE CRITICAL MISTAKE, HE DIDN'T FALL\nON HIS SWORD IMMEDIATELY. HE ISSUED AN APOLOGY WHICH WAS\nBASICALLY WHATEVER. THE SAME KIND OF THING HE SAID\nTO MATT LAUER OR BILLY BUSH OR ONE OF THOSE GUYS.\nSO HE DIDN'T DO THAT. IT WAS MORE LIKE HEY, I'M SORRY\nI GOT CAUGHT. THIS GUY IS TOAST.\nTHERE'S SO MANY OTHER ATHLETES OUT THERE THAT SPONSORS CAN\nCHOOSE FROM THAT HAVE STERLING REPUTATIONS AND HAVE NEVER DONE\nANYTHING WRONG, AT LEAST NOT PUBLICLY.\nLOCHTE WILL NEVER GET ANOTHER ENDORSEMENT DEAL.\n>> THIS BEHAVIOR IS IN SOME WAY WHAT ADVERTISERS WANT TO LURE\nMILLENNIALS.

GREAT TO HAVE YOU ON THE\nPROGRAM. >> HI, KIMBERLY.\nEVERYONE RIVETTED WITH THIS STORY AND HOW THIS WENT DOWN\nIS THIS REALLY AN AUTO POLLING?\n>> IT'S AN APOLOGY BOTH. THE LAST PART THAT YOU READ\nWHERE HE SAYS WE'RE STRANGERS IN A STRANGE LAND\nTHERE IS A LANGUAGE BARRIER. THERE IS NOT A LANGUAGE\nBARRIER WHEN YOU GO AND PEE ON THE BATHROOM FLOOR\nOUTSIDE THE BATHROOM AND BREAK STUFF INSIDE AND LEAVE\nWHEN YOU ARE DRUNK AND SAY THAT I'M NOT GOING TO PAY SO\nTHEY HAVE TO HOLD A GUN UNTIL THE COPS GET THERE\nTHAT'S NOT A LANGUAGE BARRIER.\nSO, YOU KNOW, LOOK, THEY ARE KIND OF WALKING A TIGHT ROPE\nNOW BECAUSE ON THE OTHER ON ONEO APOLOGIZE TO BRAZIL AND\nAMERICANS FOR TRASHING RIO WITH A LIE HE TOLD ON\nTELEVISION AND ON THE OTHER HAND, HE HAS TO WORRY HE\nDOESN'T WANT TO GET INDICTED AND CHARGED WITH A CRIME IN\nBRAZIL. HE WAS WALKING THAT LINE.\nI WILL TELL YOU THIS, KIMBERLY, HERE IS WHAT I DO\nKNOW AND I FIND THIS EXTREMELY INTERESTING.\nWE ARE TOLD AND THIS IS 100 PERCENT.\nWE ARE TOLD BY -- BY UNITED STATES OLYMPIC OFFICIALS\nTHAT USOC THAT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER RYAN'S MOM\nON SUNDAY MORNING SAID THAT HER SON WAS ROBBED AND IT\nWAS TERRIFYING, THE USOC WENT TO RYAN AND THE OTHER\nTHREE SWIMMERS AND INTERVIEWED THEM\nINDIVIDUALLY AND ALL OF THEM TOLD THE EXACT SAME BS STORY\nTHAT RYAN TOLD ON TELEVISION.\nIT'S PRETTY APPARENT TO ME, AT LEAST THAT ON THAT CAB\nRIDE HOME THEY SAID UH-OH, THIS IS BAD, WE HAVE GOT TO\nCOME UP WITH SOMETHING. THEY CAME ONE THAT AND THEY\nALL TOLD THAT LIE TO -- AND IT IS A LIE.\nTHEY ARE DRIVING ALONG AND THAT THESE GUYS COME UP AND\nSAY THEY ARE POLICE OFFICERS AND THEY TELL THEM TO GET\nOUT OF THE CAB. THAT WASN'T TRUE.\nAND ALL OF THEM TOLD THAT TO THE USOC.\n>> YOU ARE GETTING TO THE TRUE STORY OF WHAT REALLY\nHAPPENED. BUT, ALSO, ONE OF THEM PAID\nFOR IT BECAUSE PAY THE FINE, 10800, ALMOST $11,000.\nWHAT ABOUT THE FAIRNESS THERE?\n>> KIMBERLY, YOU ARE A LAWYER AND YOU KNOW THAT\nTHAT IS YOU KNOW THE BEST JUSTICE MONEY CAN BUY.\nTHE PEOPLE IN BRAZIL SAID, LOOK, YOU PAY THIS MONEY AND\nWE WILL FORGIVE AND FORGET. THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKED.\nHE WAS ABLE TO GET OUT OF THERE.\nAND IT WAS PROBABLY WORTH THE 11 K FOR HIM TO DO THAT.\nIS HE OUT OF THE COUNTRY. RYAN IS OUT OF THE COUNTRY.\nEVEN IF RYAN GETS CHARGED HE PROBABLY WON'T GO BACK.\nI AM TOLD BY PEOPLE -- PEOPLE IN BRAZIL ARE PISSED.\nTHEY FEEL THAT THEY DO HAVE PROBLEMS.\nBUT WHAT RYAN LOCHTE DID WAS SO SULLY THAT THE IMAGE OF\nTHAT CITY WHEN THEY REALLY TRIED TO BE GOOD DURING THE\nOLYMPICS AND DO THE RIGHT THING AND THEY ARE REALLY\nREALLY UPSET WITH HIM. >> WELL, OF COURSE, BECAUSE\nIT JUST, YOU KNOW, CAST APPAL ON THE WHOLE THING\nWITH THE OLYMPICS. THEY WERE ALREADY GETTING\nSUCH A TOUGH TIME AND BAD PRESS LEADING UP TO IT.\nPEOPLE DROPPING OUT SAYING THEY WEREN'T GOING TO\nPARTICIPATE. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ALSO\nTALKING ABOUT, HARVEY, THE OTHER OLYMPIANS THAT DID\nQUITE WELL, SHOT PUTTERS AND WEIGHT LIFTERS THEY DIDN'T\nGET ANY ATTENTION TO DEVOTE THEIR WHOLE LIVES TO\nREPRESENT THIS COUNTRY AND IT WAS ALL OVERSHADOWED.\n>> TOTALLY OVERSHADOWED. IF YOU LOOK AT EVERY\nNEWSCAST. BLOGS AND NEWSPAPERS AND\nEVERYTHING THE APPROPRIATE STORY IS RYAN LOCHTE.\nIT'S INCREDIBLE STORY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT AND\nESPECIALLY THE WAY IT UNFOLDED SINCE SUNDAY.\nI WILL SAY THIS. THAT THE BUZZ WE'RE HEARING\nIS GOOD LUCK GETTING AN ENDORSEMENT DEAL.\nAT LEAST IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.\nBUT THIS IS -- LOOK, THIS IS WAY DIFFERENT THAN MICHAEL\nPHELPS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE COMPARING THIS TO MICHAEL\nPHELPS AND SAYING THAT PHELPS HAD HIS PROBLEMS AND\nHE WAS ABLE TO OVERCOME THEM AND IS HE A HERO AGAIN.\nRYAN CAN DO THE SAME THING. IT'S NOT THE SAME THING.\nPHELPS HAD PERSONAL DEMONS HE WAS ABLE TO CONQUER AND\nDIDN'T HURT ANYBODY BUT HIMSELF WITH THOSE DEMONS\nAND WAS ABLE TO DEAL WITH IT AND DID AND THEN SUCCEEDED\nWHAT RYAN LOCHTE DID WAS HURT OTHER PEOPLE\nUNNECESSARILY. NOT JUST OTHER PEOPLE,\nANOTHER COUNTRY AND HURT THE IMAGE OF THE UNITED STATES\nAND THE ATHLETES HERE. THAT'S A BIGGER DEAL.\nAND IT'S GOING TO BE HARD FOR HIM TO OVERCOME THIS AND\nGET THESE ENDORSEMENT DEALS. >> TOUGH TIMES.\nSOMEBODY NEEDS CRISIS MANAGEMENT COUNSELOR STAT.\n>> HE HAS ONE. >> THERE YOU GO.\nOF COURSE. WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.\nYOU KNOW WHAT? WE WILL GO TO YOU FIRST TO\nFIND OUT. HARVEY, WHAT A PLEASURE.\n>> THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU, KIMBERLY.\nAND THE \"ON THE RECORD\" LEGAL PANEL IS HERE FORMER\nHOMICIDE DETECTIVE AND CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY\nTED WILLIAMS AND FORMER PROSECUTOR KATIE PHANG.\nOKAY. THE GANG IS BACK TOGETHER\nAGAIN. >> YEAH.\n>> NEVER A DULL MOMENT. WHAT HAPPENED HERE?\nBLAME IT ON RIO, I GET IT COME ON, TED.\n>> YEAH, WHEN YOU LOOK AT RYAN LOCHTE AND THIS\nSO-CALLED APOLOGY, IT'S RATHER DISINGENUOUS AT MOST.\nLOOK, KIM WERLEY, WE HAD SIMONE BILES, KATIE WILL HE\nLEDECKY.NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUTT THEY DID.\nEVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT THIS IDIOT, RYAN LOCHTE AND\nTHESE OTHER THREE GUYS. THAT IS THE SAD COMMENTARY.\nWE SENT OUR BEST OVER THERE, AND THE PRIDE IN AMERICA IS\nTHAT THEY BRING THE GOLD BACK.\nAND WHAT WE HAVE BROUGHT BACK HERE WITH LOCHTE AND\nTHEM IS EMBARRASSMENT. EMBARRASSMENT TO OUR\nCOUNTRY. >> YEAH.\nIT REALLY DOES NOT REPRESENT OUR COUNTRY WELL AT ALL.\nTHEY WERE CHOSEN TO GO OVER THERE TO REPRESENT US, TO\nWIN, KATIE. AND THIS REALLY JUST PUT\nSUCH A BAD, YOU KNOW, PAUL OVER THE WHOLE THING.\nPEOPLE ARE DISAPPOINTED. KEEP IN MIND THESE GUYS ARE\nSUPPOSED TO BE ROLE MODELS. THE STUFF YOU PUT ON\nWHEATY'S BOXES, RIGHT? >> YEAH.\nBUT, YOU KNOW, YOU JUST SAID IT.\nTHEY ARE SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT OUR COUNTRY.\nI WANT PEOPLE TO REMEMBER. YOU HAVE TO FRAME THIS\nWITHIN CONTEXT, GUYS. IN BRAZIL, THIS IS HOW THEY\nTREAT MISDEMEANOR CRIMES, APPARENTLY.\nYOU MADE JIMMY FEELINGEN PAY FOR HIS FREEDOM.\nHE PAID $1,000 TO GET HIS PASSPORT BACK TO GET HIS\nFREEDOM. THIS IS HOW YOU TREAT A\nOTHERWISE MISDEMEANOR CASE. TAKE TWO AMERICANS OFF A\nPLANE AND DETAIN THEM AND DON'T GIVE THEM THEIR\nPASSPORTS TO SPEAK TO THE POLICE.\nLOCHTE IS PRETTY HALF BLANK. IT'S NOT EXACTLY A FULL\nAPOLOGY. I DON'T BELIEVE HE IS DOING\nHIMSELF ANY JUSTICE IN ANY WAY BY THE WAY THAT HE IS\nTREATING. THIS HE SHOULD JUST\nAPOLOGIZE, PAY THE $11,000 DONATION THAT FEIGEN DID AND\nBE DONE WITH IT CLOSE THE CHAPTER ON THIS AND MOVE ON.\n>> THANKS, I'M STILL STUCK IN RIO AND I'M THE ONE\nHAVING TO PAY ALL THE MONEY. PONY UP.\nIT'S NOT VERY FAIR. HE LEFT HIS SO-CALLED\nFRIENDS OVER THERE TOM BEAR THE BRUNT OF WHAT'S GOING\nON. I WILL SAY THOUGH THAT THIS\n11,000 THAT'S PAID, I DON'T SEE THAT AS OUT OF THE\nORDINARY, KATIE, BECAUSE WE DO HAVE RESTITUTION.\nIF DO YOU SOMETHING IN THIS COUNTRY, YOU CAN BE MADE TO\nPAY RESTITUTION. >> I DON'T DISAGREE.\nI DON'T DISAGREE. HERE'S THE THING.\nIN AMERICA, YOU DON'T HAVE PEOPLE POINTING GUNS AT YOU\nSAYING PAY THE RESTITUTION NOW OR YOU DON'T LEAVE.\n>> THAT WAS A BIG LIE. THATS WAS THE BIG LIE.\nTHEY WENT IN, THEY DESTROYED PROPERTY.\nSOMEONE SAID TO THEM WE WANT TO HOLD YOU UNTIL THE POLICE\nCOME AND WHAT THEY THEN SAID IS WE WILL TRY TO PAY OUR\nWAY OUT OF THIS AND THEY GAVE MONEY UP.\nBUT THAT'S THE BIG LIE THAT LOCHTE AND THEM TOLD.\nAND I WILL NOT BUY IN TO THIS.\nHE ELM PAIR WASSED THIS COUNTRY.\nIS HE AN EMBARRASSMENT TO EVERY ATHLETE WHO WENT OVER\nTHERE AND BROUGHT BACK THE GOLD AND TRIED TO BRING BACK\nTHE GOLD. >> HE IS LUCKY HE DIDN'T GET\nIN FRONT OF JUDGE WILLIAMS. LET ME TELL YOU THERE WILL\nBE SOMETHING. THERE IS A FOX NEWS SWIM\nALERT. BECAUSE FEELINGEN IS NOW\nWAITING AT THE AIRPORT TO BOARD A FLIGHT TO GET OUT OF\nRIO. NO MORE BRAZILIAN\nSUPERMODELS FOR THAT CREW. TED AND KATIE, THANK YOU.\nAND THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT MAKING A BIG\nADMISSION ABOUT THE 400-MILLION-DOLLAR CASH\nPAYMENT TO IRAN.",

ANOTHER SHAKEUP IN THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE PROMOTING VETERAN GOP\nPOLES FOR KELLYANNE CONWAY FOR HAVE MANAGER.\nIN CLEVELAND WEDNESDAY DEMOCRATIC RIVAL HILLARY CLINTON\nSAID CHANGES REALLY DON'T CHANGE A THING.\n>> I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS SHOWN US WHO HE\nIS. HE CAN HIRE AND FIRE ANYBODY HE\nWANTS FROM HIS CAMPAIGN.  THEY COULD MAKE HIM READ NEW\nWORDS FROM A TELEPROMPTER. BUT HE IS STILL THE SAME MAN WHO\nINSULTS FAMILIES, DEMEANS WOMEN, MOCKS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES\nAND THINKS HE KNOWS MORE ABOUT ISIS THAN OUR GENERALS.\n>> JOINING THE PANEL THIS WEEK WALL STREET JOURNAL COLUMNIST\nDAN HENNINGER. JASON RILE AND KSTRAUSLE.\nKIM, LET'S TAKE THESE PERSONNEL CHANGES FIRST.\nDO THESE CHOICES -- CAN THEY MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE\nCAMPAIGN? >> THEY SEEMED TO HAVE MADE SOME\nDIFFERENCE SO FAR. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN THIS WEEK IS A\nDONALD TRUMP WHO HAS BEEN READING FROM SCRIPT IN A MORE\nDISCIPLINED MANNER. WE SAW DONALD TRUMP IN\nCHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA WHO EXPRESSED REGRET FOR SOME OF THE\nCOMMENTS HE MADE AND STARTED TALKING ABOUT HOW THIS NEEDED TO\nBE A CAMPAIGN THAT PULLED PEOPLE TOGETHER.\nWE KNOW HE'S GOING TO BE GIVING A SERIES OF POLICY SPEECHES OVER\nTHE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS THAT TOUCH ON IMMIGRATION AND\nEDUCATION REFORM. THIS IS A DIFFERENT DONALD\nTRUMP. AND YOU SEE THE INFLUENCE OF\nKELLYANNE CONWAY AND THE QUESTION IS CAN HE STAY ON\nTRACK? >> I WANT TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN\nBANNON AND CONWAY. KELLYANNE CONWAY, WE SAW HER\nHAND IN THE CHARLOTTE SPEECH. WHAT EXPERIENCE DOES SHE BRING\nTO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN? >> LOOK, SHE IS MORE OF A\nVETERAN PERSON IN POLITICS WORKED ON A LOT OF CAMPAIGNS\nWITH ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT CHARACTERS IN THE PAST SO SHE'S\nCOMFORTABLE IN THAT REALM AND KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THE WOMEN'S\nVOTE AND MADE A STUDY AND AN ART OF IT.\nHER GOAL IS TO TRY TO I THINK MAYBE MAKE DONALD TRUMP NOT JUST\nMORE RIGOROUS AND DISCIPLINED BUT HUMANIZE HIS CAMPAIGN AND\nMAKE HIM MORE OPTIMISTIC. SHE SAID AS MUCH.\n>> THAT'S NOT STEVE BANNON'S  FORTE.\n>> IT'S TO APPEAL TO UNIONIZED DEMOCRATS, BLUE COLLAR WORKERS,\nTHE FORGOTTEN PEOPLE AS TRUMP DESCRIBES THEM.\nTRUMP HAS FINALLY FIGURED OUT HE'S NOT GOING TO WIN MERELY\nWITH THE BASE THAT PROVIDED HIM THE VICTORY.\n35%, 45% OF THE VOTE. THE OPINIONS POLLS SHOW THAT YOU\nLOSE IF THAT'S ALL YOU GET IN THE GENERAL ELECTION.\nNOW I READ THAT SPEECH WHERE HE TALKS ABOUT THE SYSTEM BEING\nRIGGED, THAT'S BERNIE SANDERS, WHEN HE ATTACKED WASHINGTON\nINSIDERS, THAT'S TED CRUZ. >> IT'S THE REGRET AND THE\nINCLUSIVENESS OF THE CHARLOTTE SPEECH --\n>> I'M TALKING ABOUT THE BASE HE'S TRYING TO ASSEMBLE.\nI AGREE KELLYANNE CONWAY ADDS SOMETHING WITH THE WOMEN.\nTRUMP FIGURES OUT IT NEEDS TO GO BEYOND THE PRIMARIES.\n>> WHAT ABOUT THE BANNON -- >> THIS IS DESPERATION ON THE\nPART OF DONALD TRUMP SHAKING UP HIS CAMPAIGN THIS CLOSE TO LABOR\nDAY WHICH IS THE BEGINNING OF THE HOME STRETCH.\nTHINGS ARE -- HE'S IN TROUBLE AND KNOWS IT.\nTHIS IS SOMETHING OF A HAIL MARY.\nBANNON TO ME SIGNALS THAT TRUMP WANTS TO BE TRUMP.\n>> THAT'S WHAT TRUMP SAYS. >> BANNON RUNS BREITBART, A\nWEBSITE THAT IS ANYTHING THINKING TRUMP HAS BEEN TOO MILD\nMANNERED AND MEASURED. IF YOU WATCH THE COVERAGE OF THE\nCAMPAIGN. THIS IS SOMETHING I THINK WHO\nWANTS TRUMP TO CONTINUE RUNNING THE CAMPAIGN HE RAN IN THE\nPRIMARIES AND THAT'S WHAT HE SURROUNDED HIMSELF WITH.\nI THINK KELLYANNE CONWAY, WE ALL KNOW HER AND HAVE KNOWN HER A\nLONG TIME. VERY RESPECTED.\nBUT SHE'S NOT A CAMPAIGN MANAGER.\nTHIS IS GOING TO BE NEW FOR HER. >> I DON'T THINK SHE'S --\n>> WE'LL SEE. >> I THINK THAT'S HER TITLE.\nI DON'T THINK SHE'S GOING TO MANAGE THE CAMPAIGN.\nSHE'LL IMPROVE AND REFINE THE MESSAGE.\n>> BUT CAMPAIGNS ARE ABOUT THE CANDIDATE AND THEN THERE'S ONLY\nSO MUCH ADVICE TRUMP SEEMS WILLING TO TAKE.\n>> THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.\nHE WOULD HAVE TO -- HERE'S WHAT IS SURPRISING TO ME.\nTRUMP SAID I'M NOT GOING TO PIVOT.\nI'M NOT CHANGING. I'M THE SAME PERSON.\nTHEN HE GIVES THE SPEECH WHICH IS A DIFFERENT PERSON.\nAT LEAST DIFFERENT RHETORIC. IN MY VIEW, IF HE HAD GIVEN THAT\nSPEECH AT THE CONVENTION AND THAT HAD BEEN THE SPEECH FOR THE\nLAST THREE WEEKS, I THINK THIS CAMPAIGN COULD BE IN A DIFFERENT\nPLACE. >> YEAH.\nIT WAS A VERY -- IT WAS A SPEECH TO ALL THE PEOPLE, TO THE\nFORGOTTEN PEOPLE WHO AREN'T WASHINGTON INSIDERS BUT TO ALL\nAMERICANS. I THINK THERE WAS SOMETHING IN\nTHERE FOR ALL AMERICANS TO APPRECIATE AND I THINK THIS HAS\nBEEN A GOOD FEW DAYS.",

YOU HAVE PRESIDENT OBAMA OFF\nGOLFING, NOT WILLING TO BREAK INTO HIS VACATION.\nFOR SOME REASON HILLARY CLINTON IS TAKING A COUPLE OF DAYS OFF\nTO REST. AND THE ONE TEAM THAT WANTED TO\nGO DOWN AND LOOK AT WHAT HAS BEEN CALLED THE WORST DISASTER\nIN THE LAST FEW YEARS WAS, IN FACT, TRUMP AND PENCE.\nI THINK IT'S SENDING THE EXACTLY THE RIGHT SIGNAL OF CONCERN AND\nCOMPASSION AND WILLINGNESS TO GO TO WHERE PROBLEMS ARE AND TO\nHAVE THE ENERGY AND DRIVE TO DO IT.\n>> WELL, THAT LEADS ME TO MY NEXT QUESTION WITH YOU BECAUSE I\nKNOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN A BIG ADVOCATE OF HAVING DONALD TRUMP\nGO DIRECTLY TO PLACES TO CONNECT WITH AMERICANS WHERE THERE ARE\nREAL PROBLEMS IN OUR COUNTRY. AS YOU POINTED OUT WE SAW HIM\nMEETING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT IN MILWAUKEE, TRAVELING TO\nLOUISIANA TO GET A FIRST-HAND LOOK AT THE DEVASTATION FROM THE\nFLOODS AND TALK WITH FOLKS WHO ARE REALLY HURTING RIGHT NOW.\nSO YOU POINT OUT THE PRESIDENT IS STAYING ON VACATION.\nDO YOU THINK THAT THIS IS GOING TO PUT THE DEMOCRATS NOW ON\nDEFENSE BECAUSE TRUMP IS RIGHT THERE WHERE THINGS ARE HAPPENING\nAND HE'S MEETING DIRECTLY WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO HAVE A\nDIRECT IMPACT ON THE THAT HE'S GOING BEYOND THE\nRALLIES ON THE ROAD RIGHT NOW? >> WELL, I THINK THERE ARE TWO\nCONTRASTS THAT ARE STRIKING. ONE IS THAT TRUMP CARE WES\nENOUGH TO SHOW UP AND BECOME DOESN'T AND STAYS PLAYING GOLF.\nTHE OTHER IS THAT TRUMP HAS THE SHEER ENERGY AND DRIVE TO GET ON\nTHE AIRPLANE AND GO TO LOUISIANA.\nI CAN'T IMAGINE WHY HILLARY CLINTON WOULD CHOOSE RESTING FOR\nTWO DAYS OVER GOING TO LOUISIANA.\nBUT SHE DID. SO YOU MAY SEE A GROWING\nCONTRAST IN ENERGY LEVEL AS THE TRUMP PEOPLE THINK THIS IS THE\nSIGNIFICANT SUBLIMINAL ISSUE IN THE CAMPAIGN THAT HE HAS THE\nDRIVE, HE HAS THE ENERGY, HE HAS THE TOUGHNESS.\nHE CAN TAKE IT ON. HE BELIEVES SHE DOES NOT.\n>> AGAIN, I WANT TO ASK YOU THOUGH, DID YOU HAVE A DIRECT\nHAND IN GETTING HIM TO FOCUS ON TAKING HIS MESSAGE BEYOND THE\nRALLIES, TO ACTUALLY GO TO SOME OF THE HOT SPOTS IN OUR COUNTRY\nWHERE PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO SEE HOW HE REACTS TO THOSE\nSITUATIONS? >> OH, THESE DECISIONS ARE MADE\nBY A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE AROUND TRUMP IN THE AIRPLANE AND\nAT TRUMP TOWERS. THEY KNOW WHERE I STAND.\nWE ARE GOOD FRIENDS WITH VIRTUALLY ALL OF THEM.\nAND THEY KNOW FIRST OF ALL BECAUSE THEY WATCH ME ON YOUR\nSHOW AND THEY GET LOTS OF E-MAILS FROM ME.\nAND OCCASIONAL PHONE CALLS. BUT THEY'RE RUNNING THE\nCAMPAIGN. THEY'RE MAKING THE DAY-TO-DAY\nDECISIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN HE WAS IN\nMILWAUKEE, IN A MOMENT THAT HAD BEEN A REAL CRISIS FOR PEOPLE IN\nMILWAUKEE HE HAD TWO GREAT ADVISERS.\nSHERIFF CLARK, WHO IS A NATIONAL LEADER ON CRIME, AND HE HAD\nMAJOR GIULIANI, PROBABLY THE BEST MAJOR IN THE LAST 50 YEARS\nAT DEFEATING CRIME AND LOWERING THE MURDER RATE.\nWHAT A TEAM TO PUT TOGETHER TO GIVE THIS SPEECH TUESDAY NIGHT?\n>> I WANT TO GET YOUR REACTION TO THE DEPARTURE OF TRUMP'S\nCAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN PAUL MANAFORT JUST DAYS AFTER TEAM TRUMP\nANNOUNCED THE EXPANSION OF THE LEADERSHIP TEAM TO INCLUDE\nKELLYANNE CONWAY AND STEVE BANNON.\n>> I DO THINK TRUMP WANTED A VERY AGGRESSIVE FALL CAMPAIGN\nAND STEVE BANNON WHO HAS BEEN THE HEAD OF BREITBART AND\nKELLYANNE CONWAY WHO IS A TERRIFIC POLLSTER AND REALLY\nVERY KNOWLEDGEABLE POLITICAL OPERATIVE, HE'S GOT A TEAM THAT\nWILL, I THINK, ACCELERATE THE SPEED AND THE TEMPO IN THE\nDIRECTION THAT TRUMP WANTS TO GO IN.\n>> I WANTED TO GET YOUR REACTION TO THE NEWS ALSO THAT IF HILLARY\nCLINTON WINS THE ELECTION, THE CLINTON FOUNDATION WILL NO\nLONGER ACCEPT FOREIGN AND CORPORATE DONATIONS AND BILL\nCLINTON WOULD RESIGN FROM THE BOARD IN AN EFFORT TO HEAD OFF\nANY CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. SOME MIGHT ASK WHY DIDN'T THIS\nHAPPEN WHEN SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE?\n>> LOOK, THEY'RE NOW IN AN IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION.\nYOU'VE HAD DEMOCRATIC FORMER GOVERNOR ED RENDELL, FORMER\nDEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CHAIRMAN COME OUT FLATLY AND SAY THEY\nOUGHT TO CLOSE THE FOUNDATION. YOU HAD THE BOSTON GLOBE SAY\nTHEY SHOULD CLOSE THE FOUNDATION.\nTHIS HALF STEP IS AN ABSURDITY AND RAISES ALL THE QUESTIONS THE\nFOUR YEARS SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE BILL CLINTON RUNNING\nAROUND THE PLANET MAKING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OUT OF\nDICTATORSHIP, RUSSIAN BANKS, OUT OF VARIETY OF INVESTMENTS AND\nYOU HAVE TO SAY TO YOURSELF THAT THE SCANDAL OF THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION ON TOP OF THE SCANDAL OF THE E-MAILS MAY BE ENOUGH TO\nSINK HER CANDIDACY. >> AND ON THE SUBJECT OF THOSE\nE-MAILS, SHE'S NOW SAYING THAT IT WAS COLIN POWELL WHO GAVE HER\nADVICE TO HAVE A SEPARATE SERVER.\n>> WELL, YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF, YOU HAVE COLIN POWELL\nONE OF THE MOST RESPECTED MEMBERS OF THE AMERICAN\nMILITARY, SECRETARY OF STATE, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER,\nCHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS SHS AND YOU HAVE HILLARY CLINTON WHO\nHAS LIED ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE. NOW, IF THEY TAKE TWO DIFFERENT\nPOSITIONS, WHAT DON'T YOU MET SHE'S THE ONE THAT'S WRONG?\n90-1. >> OVERALL THE FALL OUT FOR YOU\nYOU THINK THIS IS CONTINUE TO BE DRIP, DRIP, DRIP AS WE HEAD TO\nTHE FALL IN TERMS OF THE REVELATIONS THAT WILL COME\nFORWARD FROM THE E-MAILS? >> I HAD A CHANCE YESTERDAY TO\nTAKE A TWO-HOUR BRIEFING ON AN OVERVIEW OF CLINTON WORLD.\nAND IT WAS SO STAGGERING. THERE'S SO MUCH STUFF COMING OUT\nIN SEPTEMBER, I DON'T THINK SHE'LL EVER GET OUT FROM UNDER\nIT. JUST CORRUPTION AFTER CORRUPTION\nAFTER CORRUPTION. ALMOST NONE HAS YET SEEN THE\nSURFACE. WHEN IT DOES I THINK HER\nCANDIDACY WILL DROWN. >> WOW, THAT'S A SOBERING\nPREDICTION INDEED FROM YOU, MR. SPEAKER.\nI KNOW YOU'VE BEEN ON THE RECORD SAYING YOU STILL REALLY BELIEVE\nTHAT DONALD TRUMP CAN WIN THIS. >> LOOK, IF SHE DROWNS SHE WINS.\nIF ALL OF THIS STUFF CRASHES IN ON HER AND SHE GETS BEAT, THE\nPERSON WHO GOING TO WIN IS",

HE NEEDS TO ATTRACT MORE\nSUBURBAN WOMEN TO SUPPORT HIM. OBVIOUSLY INCREASE HIS NUMBER OF\nINDEPENDENTS THAT WOULD SUPPORT HIM.\nAND EVEN MINORITIES BECAUSE WHY -- HE'S FINE WITH HIS BASE.\nTHIS IS GREAT. BUT YOU NEED TO ALSO THINK ABOUT\nWHAT WOMEN, FOR EXAMPLE, WANT TO SEE.\nTHEY WANT TO SEE MORE OF NOT ONLY CAN YOU COME AND FIX THE\nECONOMY, BUT SHOW US THAT YOU CARE.\nI THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE STARTING TO SEE WITH SOME OF\nTHESE SPEECHES THAT TRUMP IS LAYING OUT.\n>> GINA, SOME SHAKEUP.

HE'S IN FOR THE TIME BEING.\nKELLYANNE CONWAY, ALSO A FANTASTIC CAMPAIGN ADVISER.\nYOUR THOUGHTS ON THE SHAKEUP? >> I THINK WE'RE SEEING THE\nRESULTS OF THIS. I WOULDN'T CALL IT A SHAKEUP.\nI'VE SAID FROM THE BEGINNING THAT TRUMP KNOWS A COUPLE OF\nTHINGS VERY WELL. THIS IS WHERE HIS EXPERIENCE,\nHIS BECOME ACUMEN IS SERVING HIM.\nHE KNOWS HOW TO SURROUND HIMSELF WITH GOOD PEOPLE.\nHE KNOWS TIMING. HE KNOWS WHEN TO PEAK.\nI THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE'S DOING.\nHE KNEW THAT HE DIDN'T NEED TO PEAK WHEN EVERYBODY WAS\nPANICKING ABOUT THE POLLS. WE'RE STARTING TO SEE THOSE\nCOMING TOGETHER. AND YOU SEE THAT NOW THAT HE'S\nMADE SOME OF THESE CAMPAIGN CHANGE, I THINK HILLARY\nCLINTON'S IN REAL TROUBLE. HE'S PROVING HE CAN BE AUTHENTIC\nAND READ FROM A PROMPTER. WHAT IN THE WORLD IS SHE GOING\nTO DO? >> A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, DONALD\nTRUMP WAS LEAVING. EVERYONE SAYING THERE'S ONLY 80\nDAYS OR SO UNTIL THE ELECTION. A LOT CAN HAPPEN.\n>> ABSOLUTELY. I THINK THIS WAS ALWAYS GOING TO\nBE A CLOSE RACE IN TERMS OF THE VOTE.\nI'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE NOW AND ALL OF THE MAPS\nLOOK ABSOLUTELY DISASTROUS FOR THE GOP.\nI WANTED TOUCH ON SOMETHING GINA SAID.\nTHIS IS OBVIOUSLY A SHAKEUP. HE'S TOTALLY RESTRUCTURED THE\nTOP OF HIS CAMPAIGN. I THINK IT'S A SMART MOVE.\nI RESPECT KELLYANNE CONWAY ENORMOUSLY.\nBUT I WOULD SAY THAT STEVE BANNON, HIS TACTICS ALMOST UNDO\nWHAT IT IS THAT SHE'S THERE TO DO.\nI WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF WE SAW TRUMP GOING OFF TELEPROMPTER\nA LITTLE, AS WELL, TOO. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT SHORED UP\nHIS BASE. I DON'T THINK IT PLAYS AS WELL\nIN THE GENERAL ELECTION CROWD. I DON'T THINK WE'LL HAVE\nTELEPROMPTER DON FOR THE NEXT 80 DAYS.\n>> RICK, YOUR THOUGHT ON THE NEW SHAKEUP OR STRUCTURE OF THE\nCAMPAIGN? >> LOOK, I THINK IT'S A --\nDEFINITELY A BIG SHAKEUP. I THINK JESSICA'S RIGHT.\nIT WAS NEEDED. BUT LOOK, I DISAGREE WITH HER A\nLITTLE BIT IN THAT DONALD TRUMP'S PROBLEM IS JUST WITH GOP\nVOTERS. IF HE CAN BRING THEM HOME, THE\nNUMBERS SHOW, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE IN D.C. DON'T WANT TO\nADMIT THIS, BUT TRUMP IS DOING BETTER THAN ROMNEY WITH NONWHITE\nVOTERS AND CATEGORIES EXCEPT FOR WITH REPUBLICANS.\nHE NEEDS TO BRING REPUBLICANS HOME.\nTHE COMBINATION OF STEVE BANNON AND KELLYANNE CONWAY IS EXACTLY\nPLAYING TO THAT. THEY ARE TRY AND WOULD TRUE\nREPUBLICANS. THEY KNOW THE BASE AND KNOW\nCONSERVATIVES. I THINK THE COMBINATION OF THEM\nARE GOING TO HELP BRING REPUBLICANS HOME.\nI LIKE THE NEW TRUMP. I LIKE THE SELF-REFLECTIVE\nTRUMP. I THINK IT WAS NEEDED.\n>> WHAT DO YOU SAY, STILL TIME, RIGHT?\n>> THERE ARE 80 DAYS. WE'VE HAD 430 DAYS OF VERBAL\nCARNAGE. TO MERCEDES AND RICHARD'S POINT\nABOUT REPUBLICAN WOMEN, HE NAMED A CEO FOR HIS CAMPAIGN THAT\nWROTE A HEADLINE THAT SAID \"BIRTH CONTROL MAKES WOMEN\nUNATTRACTIVE AND CRAZY.\" I'M NOT SURE THAT'S GOING TO\nPLAY TO REPUBLICAN WOMEN, MODERATE WOMEN OR --\n>> OR ANY WOMEN OUT THERE.

I THINK HE STOOD ON MESSAGE.\nHE ONLY TALKED ABOUT OBAMA AND HILLARY, AND HE OFFERED\nSOLUTIONS TO VERY SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS THAT WE FACE IN A\nCOUNTRY AND A WORLD. AND HIS TRIP TO LOUISIANA\nEARLIER TODAY. >> I THINK THIS IS CLEARLY THE\nBEST WEEK HE HAS HAD, AND I THINK EWE RIGHT, PART OF WHAT\nMADE IT SO POWERFUL IS HE SHOWED LEADERSHIP.\nHE DEALT WITH IRRECONCILABLE -- AND DEVELOPING A VERY POWERFUL\nSPEECH AND DELIVERED IT IT VERY WELL.\nHE SHOWED LEADERSHIP IN NORTH CAROLINA, IN GOING TO LOUISIANA\nAT A TIME WHEN YOU HAVE BARACK OBAMA GOLFING AND NOT ABLE TO\nGET OFF OF A VACATION. HILLARY CLINTON TIRED AND TAKING\nA DAY OR TWO OFF TO REST. SO YOU SAW REAL LEADERSHIP.\nIN HIS SPEECH TODAY, THERE IS A CLEAR STATEMENT THAT HE WANTS TO\nBE A VEHICLE TO CHANGE THEIR LIVES.\nSO OFFER THEM A CHANCE TO HAVE SAFETY IN POLICE STATIONS LIKE\nMILWAUKEE, CHICAGO, AND BALTIMORE.\nHE WANTS TO REPRESENT ALL AMERICANS.\nALL AMERICANS IN THEIR APPEAL, THAT MEANS I THINK THAT IS THE\nBEST WEEK SO FAR. .\n>> WE HAVE 81 DAYS TO GO NOW. IF WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE SECRET\nSAUCE, I THINK IT IS ABOUT WINNING DAYS.\nBUT OBJECTIVELY SPEAKING, FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, HIM STAYING\nFOCUSED ON HILLARY AND OBAMA'S FAILURES, TALKING ABOUT REAL\nISSUES, AND HOW BAD THINGS HAVE GOTTEN, AND HOW BAD THINGS CAN\nBE, THERE SEEMS TO BE A SPECIAL SAUCE THERE.\nTHAT IS MAYBE WORKING VERSUS GETTING DISTRACTED.\n>> I THINK IT IS TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT AND HE IS WIPING WITH\nIT. HE IS VERY SMART AND HE WILL DO\nWHAT WORKS. AND THE FACT THAT HE IS THE ONE\nTHAT INSISTED IN MILWAUKEE THEY USE A TELEPROMPT TER BECAUSE\nWHAT HE WAS SAYING WAS SO COME BELLING AND SO POTENTIALLY\nDANGEROUS YOU HAD TO SAY IT WITH GREAT CLARITY AND DISCIPLINE,\nAND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HE PULLED OFF.\nI THINK ADDING TO THE CALIBER OF STEVE BANNON AND KELLY CONWAY,\nIT WILL BE REMARKABLE IN HELPING HIM TO FASHION -- HE CLEARLY\nWANTS TO WIN. >> WHAT ABOUT POLL LEADING?\n>> I DON'T KNOW HOW THE DETAILS WORK.\nI THOUGHT PAUL DID A GREAT JOB OF GETTING A NATIONAL,\nPROFESSIONAL CAMPAIGN. I'M GUESSING THAT HE WAS BEING\nGENEROUS IN RECOGNIZING THAT THE NEWS MEDIA WOULD NOT LET UP\nABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN UKRAINE. NOBODY IS GOING TO UNDER\nESTIMATE HOW MUCH HE DID TO HELP THE CAMPAIGN GET TO WHERE IT IS\nRIGHT NOW. >> VERY INTERESTING, HE\nMENTIONED THE SPEECH IN MICHIGAN EARLIER TODAY PIP THINK IT WAS\nSIMILAR TO HIS REACH OUT JUST OUTSIDE OF MILWAUKEE TO THE\nBLACK COMMUNITY. WE HAVE A 58% INCREASE.\nSO OBAMA HAS BEEN PRESIDENT, 20% INCREASE.\nBLACK COMMUNITY, OUT OF THE LABOR FORCE.\nAND WHAT WAS INTERESTING IS MONDAY WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT\nISIS, HE TALKED ABOUT THE PERSECUTION OF WOMEN'S, GAYS,\nCHRISTIANS, AND JEWS THAT GIVE HILLARY CLINTON MONEY.\nTHEN HE TALKED ABOUT THE BLACK COMMUNITY, AND THEN HE SAID THIS\nIN NORTH CAROLINA. I THINK WE WOULD BE NEGLIGENT IF\nWE DENT PLAY THIS. >> SOMETIMES IN THE HEAT OF\nCOMPETITION, YOU SAY THE WRONG THINGS.\nI HAVE DONE THAT AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I REGRET IT.\nAND DO I REGRET IT, PARTICULARLY WHERE IT MAY HAVE CAUSED\nPERSONAL PAIN. TOO MUCH TO BE AT STAKE FOR US\nTO BE CONSUMED WITH THESE OCCASIONS.\nONE THING I CAN PROMISE YOU THIS.\nI WILL ALWAYS TELL YOU THE TRUTH.\n>> I THOUGHT THAT WAS IN A IMPORTANT MOMENT.\n>> THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO TOLD ME THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A HUGE\nMOMENT, LOOK, DONALD TRUMP A REMARKABLE PERSON.\nHE IS EXTRAORDINARILY SMART. REMARKABLY SUCCESSFUL AND A\nGREAT COMPETITOR. IT WAS A CONTEST BETWEEN HIS\nSTUBBORNNESS AND HIS IQ. HIS IQ KNEW HE HAD TO MOVE TO A\nNEW LEVEL AND BECOME A REAL PRESIDENTIAL ALTERNATIVE.\nSTUBBORNNESS SAID WAIT, I HAVE ELSE BEEN THIS GUY.\nWHY AM I HAVING TO CHANGE. I THINK WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN THIS\nWEEK, I DON'T KNOW IF HE WILL LIKE THE TERM OR NOT.\nMORE MATURE, AND IN A WAY MORE HUMBLE DONALD TRUMP.\nTHEY ARE SEEKING TO LEAD THE MOST COMPLICATED COUNTRY IN THE\nWORLD. IT IS A REAL BURDEN.\nYOU HAVE TO THINK THROUGH IN A SPECIAL WAY HOW TO LEAD THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE. THIS IS HOW WE SAW OVER AND OVER\nTHAT WE ARE BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER IN A WAY THAT IS VERY,\nVERY IMPORTANT. IT HILLARY AND TRUMP HAD THEIR\nCONVENTIONS. DO YOU SEE THIS -- LET ME ASK\nYOU THIS STRAIGHT UP, DO YOU THINK HE WINS THIS?\n>> YEAH, FOR TWO REASONS. FIRST OF ALL, I WAS PRIVILEGED\nTO SIT THROUGH A BRIEFING LEARNING ALL OF THE THINGS THEY\nKNOW ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON AND BILL CLINTON.\nIT IS STAGGERING. WE ONLY KNOW 10% OF WHAT WE\nKNOW. HE HAVE DROWN UNDER EVERYTHING\nTHEY HAVE FOUND. A FORMER CHAIRMAN SAYING THEY\nNEED TO CLOSE THE FOUNDATION. THE BOSTON GLOBE, A LIBERAL SOURCE, SAYING CLOSE THE\nFOUNDATION. >> THEY WILL NOT CLOSE IT UNLESS\nSHE WINS. HERE IS THE REAL PROBLEM.\nWHATEVER THEY SAY NOW ABOUT WHAT THEY WILL SAY, THEY ADMITTING\nTHERE IS AT LEAST AN APPEARANCE OF CORRUPTION.\nTHEY ARE CASE AFTER CASE. SHE IS GOING TO LOSE.\nNOW WHEN SHE LOSES, DONALD TRUMP WILL WIN, BUT MY SECOND POINT\nDONALD TRUMP IS ON THE VERGE OF CREATING A GENERALLY HISTORIC\nMOVEMENT THAT SPRINGS TOGETHER PEOPLE OF ALL BACKGROUNDS.\nPOTENTIALLY A BIGGER COALITION THAN REAGAN HAD, AND THIS IS\nWHERE HE APPEALS, AND IN THIS MEETING TOMORROW WITH LATINO\nLEADERS IN NEW YORK, YOU WILL SEE MORE AND MORE EFFORT, I\nTHINK, FOR THEM TO BRING ALL AMERICAS TOGETHER TO MAKE\nAMERICA GREAT AGAIN NAP, TO ME, THE COMBINATION OF POSITIVE\nTHINGS, AS SHE SINKS, COULD LEAD TO A HISTORIC ELECTION.\n>> THANK YOU, WE'LL HAVE MORE WITH NEWT GINGRICH AFTER THIS\nBREAK.

THAT'S THE POINT AT WHICH DONALD\nTRUMP SAID BASICALLY I'M TOLD BLEW A GASKET AND SAID, THIS GUY\nIS OUT OF HERE. SO THERE MAY BE A RELATIONSHIP\nON PAPER, BUT I THINK THE CUT -- THE TIES ARE BEING CUT.\n>> CHARLES, THE SECOND SOUNDBITE WE HEARD FROM THERE AFTER DONALD\nTRUMP'S SON WAS COREY LEWANDOWSKI WHO HIMSELF FOUND\nHIMSELF ON THE OUTS NOT THAT LONG AGO IN JUNE.\nIS THERE -- AT SOME POINT DOES THE CHANGEOVER, THE TURNOVER\nAPPEAR THAT THERE'S TOO MUCH DISARRAY OR IS THIS A FINAL SET\nTHAT'S THE RIGHT TEAM THAT'S GOING TO MOVE HIM FORWARD?\n>> YOU GET TWO STRIKES. THREE STRIKES AND YOU'RE OUT.\nTHE THIRD FIRING IT WILL BE CALLED DISARRAY, CHAOS,\nCONFUSION. BUT I THINK AT THIS POINT PEOPLE\nUNDERSTAND THAT WITH THE STORIES COMING OUT ABOUT MANAFORT, IT\nWAS IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP HIM ON. SO THAT'S SORT OF EXPLICABLE.\nTHE OTHER PART IS WE SAW FROM THE SPEECH THAT TRUMP MADE LATE\nTODAY IN MICHIGAN, THE PROCESS OF SOFTENING THE MAN IS UNDER\nWAY. I MEAN, THIS IS A VERY HEAVY\nSOAK, A WASH, A DRY, A SPIN AND THEY'RE DOING IT, I THINK,\nRATHER EFFECTIVELY, TALKING ABOUT THE CONCERN OF MINORITIES,\nCONFESSING THAT HE SUPPOSEDLY SAID THE WRONG THINGS, LET'S SEE\nIF HE CAN DO THAT WITHOUT READING OFF A TELEPROMPTER.\nAND I'M SURE HE'LL BE ASKED WHAT DO YOU REGRET, CAN YOU GIVE AN\nEXAMPLE. IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF\nHE GIVES AN EXAMPLE AND WHICH EXAMPLE IT MIGHT BE.\nSO THAT PROCESS IS GOING ON. THE NEW TEAM IS IN CHARGE OF\nTHAT. SO THIS MAKES A LOT OF SENSE.\n>> HE'S GETTING A LOT OF CREDIT, A LOT OF PRAISE THIS WEEK FOR\nTHE SPEECHES HE'S HAD, AS YOU SAID, TO THE TELEPROMPTER.\nTHEY'RE MORE SCRIPTED AND PEOPLE SAYING HE'S STAYING ON MESSAGE\nAND IT'S A BETTER WEEK FOR HIM. I WANT TO PLAY A SOUNDBITE FROM\nLAST NIGHT, CHARLES, WHERE YOU MENTIONED HE EXPRESSED SOME SORT\nOF REGRET ABOUT THE WAY SOME OF THE THINGS HE SAID CAME OUT.\n>> I NEVER WANTED TO LEARN THE LANGUAGE OF THE INSIDERS, AND\nI'VE NEVER BEEN POLITICALLY CORRECT.\nSOMETIMES IN THE HEAT OF DEBATE ISSUES, YOU DON'T CHOOSE THE\nRIGHT WORDS OR YOU SAY THE WRONG THING.\nI HAVE DONE THAT. AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I REGRET\nIT. PARTICULARLY WHERE IT MAY HAVE\nCAUSED PERSONAL PAIN. >> LISA, TO THAT POINT,\nKELLYANNE CONWAY WHO HAS NOW BEEN ELEVATED WITHIN THE\nCAMPAIGN SAYS THAT MIGHT EVEN INCLUDE SOMETHING LIKE AN\nAPOLOGY TO THE KAHN FAMILY, THE GOLD STAR MUSLIM AMERICAN\nFAMILY. >> I THINK AMERICANS HAVE BEEN\nWAITING FOR SOME KIND OF EMPATHY FROM DONALD TRUMP.\nI THINK THIS IS A POSITIVE STEP. WITH HIM VISITING LOUISIANA,\nTHIS IS A CONNECTION OF I CARE ABOUT YOU, BIGGER THAN SELF.\nAND I THINK VOTERS NEED TO HEAR THAT.\nI HONESTLY THINK THAT HIM HAVING A ROUGH COUPLE WEEKS COULD HAVE\nBEEN THE BEST THING TO HAPPEN TO DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE SOMETIMES\nCANDIDATES, PARTICULARLY THE STUBBORN ONES NEED TO GET KICKED\nIN THE TEETH TO CHANGE COURSE. WE'VE SEEN HIM GIVING ME NOR\nNUANCED SPEECHES AND SHOWING A BIT MORE EMPATHY AND ON THE\nMECHANICAL SIDE OF THINGS, GOING UP WITH CAMPAIGN ADS, HIRING A\nDATA AND ANALYTICS FIRM. SEEING HIM RAISE MONEY, WHICH WE\nSAW HIM OUT-RAISE HILLARY CLINTON WITH SMALL DONATIONS.\nSO I THINK WE'RE STARTING TO SEE POSITIVE STEPS AND MAYBE GETTING\nBEAT UP A LITTLE BIT IS WHAT IT TOOK FOR HIM TO SORT OF COME TO\nTHIS CONCLUSION AND THE REALITY OF WHAT WAS GOING ON.\n>> AND SPEAKING OF GETTING BEATEN UP, PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS\nGOTTEN BEATEN UP BY A NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN LOUISIANA INCLUDING A\nPAPER THAT RAN AN EDITORIAL, LISTEN, YOU HAVE TO GET DOWN\nHERE. THIS IS IMPORTANT.\nNOW WE LEARN HE WILL GO DOWN TUESDAY.\nDO YOU THINK HE WAS DRAWN BY THE TRUMP/PENCE PRESENCE TODAY.\nOR DID HE REALIZE, IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD, I HAVE TO MAKE A\nCHANGE IN MY SCHEDULE. >> I DON'T KNOW IF THE TRUMP\nAPPEARANCE HIMSELF PRECIPITATED IT, BUT AS DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING\nTO DEFEND THIS DECISION, WELL, HE'D JUST BE GETTING IN THE WAY\nAND THE GOVERNOR DOESN'T WANT HIM THERE.\nTHESE ARE IN MANY CASES THE EXACTLY SAME PEOPLE WHO\nCRITICIZED GEORGE BUSH FOR DOING A FLYOVER DURING KATRINA.\nSO THERE IS A PLACE FOR OUR LEADERS TO SHOW UP AT THESE\nEVENTS AND BE ON THE SCENE. AND, YOU KNOW, IN THIS CASE, YOU\nDO GET THE SENSE THAT, YOU KNOW, PRESIDENT OBAMA IS FEELING LIKE\nTHIS IS HIS LAST YEAR IN OFFICE AND HE CAN DO THINGS ON HIS OWN\nTIMETABLE. >> AFTER THAT VISIT BY TRUMP AND\nPENCE DOWN THERE TODAY, YOU SPOKE THIS AFTERNOON, WE COVERED\nMUCH OF THAT LIVE ON THE AIR. I WANT TO PLAY A SOUNDBITE THAT\nDONALD TRUMP, THE GOP NOMINEE HAD IN APPEALING TO THE\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE. HE WAS PRETTY BLUNT ABOUT IT.\nHERE'S WHAT HE SAID. >> LOOK HOW MUCH\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES HAVE SUFFERED UNDER DEMOCRATIC\nCONTROL. TO THOSE I SAY THE FOLLOWING.\nWHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE BY TRYING SOMETHING NEW LIKE TRUMP?\nYOU'RE LIVING IN POVERTY. YOUR SCHOOLS ARE NO GOOD.\nYOU HAVE NO JOBS. 58% OF YOUR YOUTH IS UNEMPLOYED.\nWHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE?\n>> CHARLES, PEOPLE WHO LOVE HIM SAY THEY LOVE THE BLUNT TALK,\nTHEY LOVE THE HONESTY. WILL THAT APPEAL WORK?\n>> WELL, I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO APPEAL TO GET A LARGE\nNUMBER OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS ON NOVEMBER 8.\nI THINK WHAT THIS IS AN APPEAL -- THIS IS PART OF THE\nSHAPING OF THE IMAGE, THE SOFTENING, TRYING TO REMOVE THE\nEDGES. THE WORST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN\nIN THE PRECINCTS OF, SAY, YOU KNOW, THE SUBURBAN REPUBLICAN\nPOPULATION IS TO BE ACCUSED OF RACISM.\nCREDIBLY OR NOT. AND WE'VE EVEN HEARD IT SAID BY\nPAUL RYAN REGARDING WHAT TRUMP HAD SAID ABOUT THE MEXICAN --\nSO-CALLED MEXICAN JUDGE. I THINK WHAT HE HAS TO DO, HE\nHAS TO BANISH THAT IMAGE. HE HAS TO UNDO IT.\nI THINK THIS IS AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO DO IT.\nYOU SHOW THAT YOU ARE NOT A CANDIDATE OF SIMPLY WHITE\nPEOPLE, WHICH IS SORT OF THE MAIN STORY GOING ON HERE.\nHE CARES ABOUT AMERICA. THIS IS SORT OF THE OBAMA WE'RE\nNOT WHITE AMERICA, BLACK AMERICA.\nWE'RE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\nHE ENDED ON A KIND OF A CRESCENDO THERE TALKING ABOUT\nTHAT UNITY AND NONDIVISIVENESS. THAT'S THE OBJECT OF THIS KIND\nOF TALK. BUT THE QUESTION IS, YES, YOU\nMAY HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE, BUT WHAT EXACTLY IS HE GOING TO DO\nTHAT'S GOING TO GIVE THE JOBS TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE INNER\nCITY, ET CETERA? WE HAVEN'T HEARD THAT YET, AND\nTHAT'S WHAT WE'LL BE WAITING TO HEAR.\n>> HE OFTEN TIES THAT TO THE ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION AS WELL.\nSO WE'LL SEE. BUT NEXT UP FOR THE PANEL, THE\nFRIDAY LIGHTNING ROUND.",

DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN\nCHAIRMAN PAUL MANAFORT RESIGNING EARLIER TODAY BUT\nTHE CHANGES STARTED EARLIER THIS WEEK WITH THE ADDITION\nOF STEVE BANNON AND KELLYANNE CONWAY AND LAST\nNIGHT A POSSIBLE TURNING POINT.\nWE HEARD DONALD TRUMP TAKE ON A NEW TONE OUT ON THE\nCAMPAIGN TRAIL. >> I HAVE A MESSAGE FOR THE\nTERRORISTS TRYING TO KILL OUR CITIZENS.\nWE WILL FIND YOU. WE WILL DESTROY YOU AND WE\nWILL ABSOLUTELY WIN AND WE WILL WIN SOON.\nSHE AND BARACK OBAMA UNLEASHED ISIS WHETHER YOU\nLIKE IT OR DON'T LIKE IT, WHETHER YOU WANT TO HEAR IT\nOR DON'T. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.\nSOMETIMES IN THE HEAT OF DEBATE AND SPEAKING ON A\nMULTITUDE OF ISSUES, YOU DON'T CHOOSE THE RIGHT WORDS\nOR YOU SAY THE WRONG THING. I HAVE DONE THAT AND BELIEVE\nIT OR NOT, I REGRET IT. >> WELL, WILL WE SEE MORE OF\nTHIS DONALD TRUMP? THE \"ON THE RECORD\"\nPOLITICAL PANEL IS HERE WITH EXCITEMENT.\nFROM THE \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" JASON RILEY AND\nFROM REAL CLEAR POLITICS CAITLIN HUEY BURNS.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK? I'M STILL SMILING AFTER\nDR. CARSON. >> WELL, TOUGH HABITS ARE\nHARD TO BREAK. WE ALL KNOW THAT IT'S CAN HE\nSUSTAIN IT? I THINK THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE\nARE GOING TO LOOK FOR. A SPEECH OR TWO DOES NOT A\nPOLITICAL MAKEOVER MAKE. WE HAVE TO SEE IF CAN HE DO\nTHIS. THERE IS ONLY AN UPSIDE TO\nIT I DON'T THINK IS HE GOING TO LOSE SUPPORTERS.\nI THINK HIS CORE SUPPORTERS ARE DUG.\nIN CAN HE EXPAND HIS APPEAL BY CHANGING HIS TONE?\n>> NOT JUST BUILD A WALL BUT BUILD A BRIDGE INDEED.\nRYAN? >> I AGREE.\nI THINK THERE IS MORE TO BE SEEN WHETHER HE CANNOT ONLY\nCONTINUE THIS BUT WHETHER VOTERS ARE WILLING TO GIVE\nHIM A SECOND LOOK. WHETHER THESE NUMBERS\nPERTAINING TO HIS TEMPERAMENT.\nPERTAINING TO HIS LIKABILITY AND OTHER ITEMS, WHETHER\nTHOSE ARE BAKED IN OR WHETHER THERE IS TIME TO\nCHANGE. THERE ARE ONLY 80 DAYS TO\nGO. AND THIS KIND OF SHAKEUP OF\nTHIS MAGNITUDE IS SIGNIFICANT.\nBUT I AGREE IF HE CAN STAY ON MESSAGE, HE SEEMS TO HAVE\nFOUND A HYBRID OF SORTS IN TERMS OF THIS NEW CAMPAIGN\nTEAM. >> IT SEEMS LIKE I WAS\nSPEAKING EARLIER, JASON, MEANING, YOU KNOW, JUST\nHAVING CONVERSATION ON TELEVISION WITH ERIC TRUMP\nAND THEY SEEM VERY OPTIMISTIC AND FEEL VERY\nFOCUSED AND HAPPY. THEY SAID THEY WERE HAPPY TO\nHAVE PAUL MANAFORT DO WHAT DID HE FOR THEM IN TERMS OF\nPRIMARIES AND DELS. THEY HAVE KELLY ANN.\nTHEY FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE WORKING WITH HER AND TAKING\nIT TO THAT NEXT LEVEL, YOU KNOW, IN THE FINAL STRETCH.\nAND WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT HOW THE TRUMP'S DEMEANOR,\nHIS RELATIVE EASE WITH GIVING THESE SPEECHES THAT\nTONIGHT WAS EXCELLENT IN TERMS OF HIS DELIVERY AS\nWELL? >> WELL, I THINK ON THE\nISSUES, HE IS FINE. IS HE DOING WELL ON THE\nISSUES. THE QUESTION IS CAN HE GET\nOUT OF HIS OWN WAY? AND MAKE THIS CAMPAIGN ABOUT\nHILLARY CLINTON AND HER CHARACTER AND THE ISSUES AND\nNOT ABOUT HIS PERSONAL CHARACTER.\nHE HAS BEEN HIS BIGGEST BARRIER TO DOING THAT SO,\nAGAIN, IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF WHETHER THIS IS A\nPERMANENT CHANGE AND NOT SOMETHING TEMPORARY, A BLIP.\nAND ONLY TIME WILL TELL, OBVIOUSLY.\n>> ALL RIGHT. LET'S TAKE A LISTEN.\nERIC TRUMP SPOKE EARLIER WITH MARIA BALTIMORE.\nMARIA BARTIROMO. HERE IS WHAT HE TO SAY?\n>> HE HELPED US GET THROUGH THE CONVENTION.\nHE HELPED US DO A GREAT JOB WITH THE DELEGATES.\nYOU KNOW, NOW YOU LOOK AT KELLYANNE AND SOME OF THE\nOTHER PEOPLE WE ARE BRINGING IN AND THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY\nFANTASTIC. THEY WILL BE THE ONES THAT\nBRING US ALL THE WAY THROUGH NOVEMBER 8TH AND ULTIMATELY\nGET US THE VICTORY. MY FATHER DIDN'T WANT TO\nHAVE THE DISTRACTION LOOMING OVER THE CAMPAIGN AND QUITE\nFRANKLY LOOMING OVER ALL THE ISSUES THAT HILLARY IS\nFACING RIGHT NOW. >> CAITLIN GOOD DECISION TO\nGO AHEAD AND DO THAT? IT SEEMS LIKE IT WAS QUITE\nAMICABLE BUT MORE A NECESSITY.\n>> I'M NOT SURPRISED THAT MANAFORT CHOSE TO LEAVE.\nTHERE WERE THE DISTRACTIONS THAT ERIC WAS ALLUDING TO,\nTHE TIES TO PRO-RUSSIAN GROUPS IN UKRAINE.\nTHOSE HEADLINES WERE CONTINUING TO COME OUT.\nBUT ALSO MANAFORT'S ROLE HAD BEEN DIMINISHED WITH THE\nSTAFF CHANGES. HIS IDEA AND APPROACH TO\nTRUMP ASKING HIM TO BE MORE PRESIDENTIAL, TRYING TO GET\nHIM TO CHANGE HIS TUNA LITTLE BIT WAS REALLY\nDISREGARDED BY TRUMP. AND THAT IS APPARENT IN THE\nHIRING OF BANNON AND TO SOME EXTENT CONWAY.\n>> HOW COULD HE GET IT DONE IN 80 DAYS?\nIF YOU WERE TO GET SOME CRYSTAL BALL ADVICE WHAT\nWILL YOU SAY. >> WILL HE LISTEN TO\nKELLYANNE CONWAY? SHE IS A RESPECTED POLLSTER.\nSHE IS NOT KNOWN FOR MANAGING CAMPAIGNS.\nBANNON THE PERSON THAT'S BEING BROUGHT IN, BREITBART\nHISTORY. IF ANYTHING BREITBART THINK\nHE HAS BEEN TOO MEASURED AND CONSIDERATE IN HIS APPROACH\nAND WANTS A PREGENERAL ELECTION TRUMP.\nI DON'T THINK THAT BANNON HAS A PROBLEM WITH TRUMP\nBRINGING THAT PRIMARY STRATEGY TO THE GENERAL\nELECTION CAMPAIGN. SO I THINK THAT THIS WAS A\nDESPERATION MOVE. I THINK THEY KNOW THEY ARE\nIN TROUBLE. AND THEY ARE JUST GOING TO\nTRY SOMETHING NEW AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.\nBUT I DON'T THINK THIS CHANGE WAS MADE OUT OF A\nPOSITION OF STRENGTH. THAT'S FOR SURE.\n>> I THINK ONE ITEM TO LOOK FOR IS WHETHER TRUMP CHANGES\nAT ALL THE KINDS OF EVENTS IS HE DOING.\nHE HAS BEEN HOLDING THESE BIG RALLIES AND TRYING TO\nPITCH HIMSELF TO AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS, FOR\nEXAMPLE. BUT NOT REACHING OUT IN\nDIFFERENT WAYS TO THESE DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES.\nSO, IF HE STARTS TO ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, BACK UP\nWHAT HE IS SAYING BY CHANGING UP THESE EVENTS,\nMAYBE WE WILL SEE. >> TOMORROW IS THE OUTRAGE\nAND I WILL BE REACHING OUT TO BOTH OF YOU AGAIN A\nLITTLE BIT LATER IN THE SHOW.\nHOW IS THAT FOR A TEASE? CAITLIN AND JASON, THANK YOU\nSO MUCH. WHAT REALLY HAPPENED IN RIO?\nEVERYBODY WANTS TO KNOW. BRAND NEW DETAILS ABOUT WHAT\nWENT DOWN WITH U.S. SWIMMERS",

HEY, CARL.\n>> Reporter: HI, SANDRA, QUIET NOW BUT IT WAS ROCKING JUST A\nCOUPLE OF HOURS AGO. DONALD TRUMP HAD A BIG RALLY\nHERE, USED A TELEPROMPTER, USED A NUMBER OF POLITICAL STATEMENTS\nABOUT AFRICAN-AMERICANS, TOOK ON HILLARY CLINTON AND TOOK ON\nPRESIDENT OBAMA AND NONE OF THE CROWD SEEMED TO MIND AT ALL HE\nWAS USING A TELEPROMPTER. IN FACT HE GOT GOOD REVIEWS TO\nUSING IT. IT HAS GONE PRETTY WELL FOR HIM\nTHIS WEEK. EARLIER TODAY HE WAS IN\nLOUISIANA. AND WHEN HE GOT HERE TONIGHT ONE\nOF THE THINGS THAT HE DID WAS POINT OUT WHILE HE GOT DOWN TO\nLOUISIANA AND LOOKED AT THE FLOODS, PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS BEEN\nIN MARTHA'S VINEYARD ON VACATION.\nAND SUGGESTED IT WAS ALMOST A DERELICTION OF THE PRESIDENT'S\nDUTY NOT TO GO. >> I JUST GOT BACK FOR THE TOUR\nOF THE DEVASTATION IN LOUISIANA. THE SPIRIT OF THE PEOPLE IS\nINCREDIBLE. THE DEVASTATION, LIKEWISE, THEY\nHAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT.\nBUT THE SPIRIT OF THE PEOPLE IS INCREDIBLE.\nAND HONESTLY, OBAMA OUGHT TO GET OFF THE GOLF COURSE AND GET DOWN\nTHERE. >> PRESIDENT HAS BEEN DOING A\nLOT OF THAT GOLFING, YESTERDAY HE WAS OUT ON THE GOLF COURSE\nWITH THE COMEDIAN, LARRY DAVID. BUT THE WHITE HOUSE HAS SAID\nTHAT WHEN THE PRESIDENT GETS BACK FROM VACATION WILL GO TO\nLOUISIANA THIS COMING TUESDAY. THAT SAID, THE MORNING AND THE\nTOUR WAS SOMEWHAT OVERSHADOWED BY YET ANOTHER INCIDENT IN THE\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN. PAUL MANAFORT OFFERED HIS\nRESIGNATION, AND TRUMP ACCEPTED IT.\nALTHOUGH IT WAS FAIRLY OBVIOUS WHEN THE OTHERS WERE ADDED THAT\nMANAFORT HAD BEEN LAYERED. AND FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES\nWHEN YOU GET PUSHED ASIDE FROM OTHERS WHO WERE BROUGHT IN ABOVE\nYOU THAT IS WHEN YOU SHOULD LEAVE.\nTHERE IS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PRESS CONFERENCE AND CRITICISM,\nNEWS REPORTS THAT HE HAD GOTTEN VERY CLOSE TO A PRO-RUSSIAN\nFIGURE, AND NOT DISCLOSED IT ON DISCLOSURE FORMS.\nTHAT WAS THE KIND OF DISTRACTIONS THAT EVEN HIS SON,\nERIC, SAID HIS FATHER DIDN'T WANT IN THE CAMPAIGN.\nSO MANAFORT, AND THE CAMPAIGN MANAGER DOING A LOT OF\nINTERVIEWS AND TALKING HOW TRUMP WOULD BE MORE SUBSTANTIVE,\nDEALING WITH POLICIES AND LESS NAME-CALLING.\nWE'VE HEARD A CONSIDERABLE DECREASE IN THE NAME-CALLING,\nINSTEAD OF CALLING HILLARY CLINTON CROOKED HILLARY, HE\nOCCASIONALLY CALLS HER HIS OPPONENT.\nTHERE IS SKEPTICISM, AMONG SOME OF THE SUPPORTERS IN THE\nAUDIENCE SAYING WE'LL SEE HOW LONG IT LASTS.\nBUT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS A BOUNCE IN ITS STRIDE THIS WEEK\nAND I THINK WE CAN EXPECT TO SEE MORE OF IT.\nSANDRA? >> SO MUCH HAPPENING THIS WEEK\nON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, YOU'RE ON IT FOR US, THANKS, CARL CAMERON.\nALL RIGHT AS WE MENTIONED TONIGHT THE FOUR MAJOR SPEECHES\nIN THE LAST FIVE DAYS WHILE TOUCHING ON ISSUES TO ISIS AND\nIMMIGRATION AND TO LAW AND ORDER AND THE MINORITY VOTE.\nTHE GOP NOMINEE SEEMED TO KEEP TO SCRIPT.\n>> MY ADMINISTRATION WILL AGGRESSIVELY PURSUE JOINT AND\nCOALITION OPPORTUNITIES TO CRUSH AND DESTROY ISIS.\nA TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WILL ESTABLISH A CLEAR PRINCIPLE THAT\nWILL GOVERN ALL DECISIONS PERTAINING TO IMMIGRATION.\nAND WE WILL BE TOUGH. AND WE WILL BE EVEN EXTREME.\nWE SHOULD ONLY ADMIT INTO THIS COUNTRY THOSE WHO SHARE OUR\nVALUES AND RESPECT OUR PEOPLE. >> I WILL BE YOUR CHAMPION.\nI WILL BE YOUR VOICE IN THE WHITE HOUSE.\nWE WILL BRING IT BACK. WE WILL ONCE AGAIN BE A COUNTRY\nOF LAW AND ORDER. TO EVERY PARENT WHO DREAMS FOR\nTHEIR CHILDREN AND TO EVERY CHILD WHO DREAMS FOR THEIR\nFUTURE I SAY THESE WORDS TO YOU TONIGHT.\nI AM WITH YOU. I WILL FIGHT FOR YOU.\nAND I WILL WIN FOR YOU. SOMETIMES IN THE HEAT OF DEBATE\nAND SPEAKING ON A MULTITUDE OF ISSUES YOU DON'T CHOOSE THE\nRIGHT WORDS. OR YOU SAY THE WRONG THING.\nI HAVE DONE THAT. AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT, IT.\nPARTICULARLY WHERE IT MAY HAVE CAUSED PERSONAL PAIN.\n>> GUY BENSON POLITICAL EDITOR AT TOWN HALL.COM.\nFIGARO IS THE FORMER BERNIE SANDERS STAFF.\nRIC GRENELL IS A FORMER SPOKESMAN FOR TWO U.S.\nAMBASSADOR TO THE U.N. RICK, WAS THIS A PIG WEEK\nFOR DONALD TRUMP? A GOOD WEEK FOR DONALD\nTRUMP? >> YEAH, I THINK IT WAS A\nFANTASTIC WEEK. HE MADE SOME NECESSARY\nCHANGES AND HE STARTED TALKING ABOUT SPECIFIC\nPOLICIES. LOOK, I KNOW A LOT OF EAST\nCOAST REPORTERS WANT TO TALK ABOUT PROCESS HERE IN THE\nTELEPROMPTER BUT A TELEPROMPTER ONLY ALLOWS YOU\nTO GET MORE DETAILED. I KNOW A LOT OF EAST COASTERS\nWANT TO TALK ABOUT A ACT TELEPROMPTER.\nBUT ITIT  ONLY ALLOWS YOU TO GET TH\nMORE DETAILED. ALL OF THESE POLICIES ARE DONALD\nTRUMP POLICIES, THEY'RE POLICIEE OF CHANGE, POLICIES AGAINST THE\nLAST EIGHT YEARS OF PRESIDENT OBAMA. ON\nAND THEY I DISTINGUISH HIMSELF AGAINST WHAT HILLARY CLINTON IS\nGOING TO DO. HE IS OUT THERE AND HILLARY\nCLINTON IS FOLLOWING HIM. HILLARY CLINTON HAS HAD TO CATC\nUP THERE IN NEW YORK AND CALL IN SOME POLICE CHIEF TO HER, SHE DIDN'T GO OUT THERE TO THE FLOOK\nZONE, SO I THINK DONALD TRUMP HAS OWNED THE WEEK.\n>> AND HE COVERED A LOT OF  T GROUND, FOUR MAJOR SPEECHES IN\nFIVE DAYS, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU, AS CARL CAMERON POINTED OUT\nHIS APPEAL TO THE BLACK VOTERS IN THAT SPEECH IN MICHIGAN  MI\nTODAY. HE MADE A VERY SPECIFIC CALL.\nASKING FOR THE VOTE OF EVERY SINGLE AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTER.\nLISTEN. >> TONIGHT, I AM ASKING FOR THE\nVOTE OF EVERY SINGLE T AFRICAN-AMERICANRY CITIZEN IN TS\nCOUNTRY WHO WANTS TO SEE A BETTER FUTURE.\nAND AT THE END OF FOUR YEARS I T GUARANTEE YOU THAT I WILL GET\nOVER 95% OF THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTES.\nI PROMISE YOU. >> THAT IS A BIG GUARANTEE NT\nCONSIDERING WHEREON HE IS RIGHT NOW, CLINTON LEADING TRUMP IN\nBLACK VOTERS IN A BIG WAY. TRUMP AND PENCE JUST GETS 4% OF\nTHE BLACK VOTE. WHERE IS HE COMING FROM ON THAT?\n>>  THAWELL, YOU KNOW, I THINK IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO AT LEAST HK\nASK. A LOT OF TIMES I THINK IT'S\nGREAT TO AT LEAST ASK FOR THE VOTE.\nNOW JUST 90% BEING HONEST OF A CONTAIN STAFFER WHEN YOU HAVE\n90% OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS CONSISTENTLY VOTING TIME AND  G\nTIME AGAIN, IT MAY NOT WORK ASKING FOR VOTES YOU MAY NEVER\nGET. THEM MORE IMPORTANTLY IT'S IMPORTANTH\nTHAT AFRICAN-AMERICANS ASK TT THEMSELVESOM THE QUESTION IS, A\nWE BETTER OFF MORE THAN EIGHT SE YEARSN  AGO?\nTHE BOTTOM LINE AFRICAN-AMERICAN POVERTY HAS RISEN, FOUR OUT OF\nTEN CHILDREN ARE HUNGRY AND STILL IN POVERTY SO THOSE ARE W\nTHE QUESTIONS WE NEED TO STILL G ASK OURSELVES, IT GOES AWAY FROM\nMORE OR LESS NOT JUST ASKING  P WHAT POLITICIANS ARE ASKING US,\nBUT WHAT WE SHOULD BE ASKING OURSELVES AND ASKING THOSE\nPOLITICIANS, I THINK IT'S A GOOE MOVE.\nWE'LL HAVE D TO SEE IF IT'S SUCCESSFUL OR NOT.\n AF HAALD TRUMP TWEETING OUT MOMENTS AGONK AFTER HE DELIVERE\nTHIS OVSPEECH, GUYS.  C THANK YOU, MICHIGAN, THIS IS A\nMOVEMENT. HE HAD A LIVELY CROWD THERE\nTODAY, GUY, HE HAD PEOPLE EXCITED AS WE JUST HEARD FROM A\nRICK, IT'S A GREAT WEEK FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nIS THIS A TURNING POINT? DARE I ASK THAT QUESTION?\n>>  FIWELL, WE'VE HEARD IT SO MS TIMES, PEOPLE SAY THAT IS\nFINALLY THAT PRESIDENTIAL PIVOT AND THEN THE RUG GETS TAKEN OUTF\nFROMAC UNDER US, SO COLOR ME SKEPTICAL.\nBUT DESPITE THEHE  FACT THAT HIS\nCAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN RESIGNED UNDEN A MONDAY ETHICAL CLOUD, IN SPITE\nOF THAT THIS IS A MAJOR WEEK FOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, HE HAS\nGOTTEN MORE SERIOUS, THE SPEECH IN NORTH CAROLINA WAS PROBABLY\nTHE BEST OF HIS ENTIRE PRESIDENTIAL BID.\nI ALSO THINK THE JIU-JITSU, SOFTENING HIS IMAGE, SO MY HAT\nISIS OFF TO KELLY ANN CONWAY. >> SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT, RICK, PAUL MANAFORT IS OUT, AND\nWHO IS IN, STEVEN NBANNON, THE CHAIRMAN, AND KELLY ANN CONWAY,E\nAS GUY JUST MENTIONED. DO HOW WILL THEY CHANGE OR WILL  W\nTHEY SEEK TOE CHANGE DONALD TRUMP?\n>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL LET'S SAY CONGRATULATIONS TO DONALD TRUMP\nFOR APPOINTING THE FIRST FEMALE CAMPAIGN MANAGER FOR A GOP\nNOMINEE. THAT MESSAGE IS T NOT GETTING O\nTHERE. HE IS NOT GETTING THE CREDIT FOR\nTHAT APPOINTMENT. KELLY ANN IS A FANTASTIC PICK AS\nCAMPAIGN MANAGER.  A LOOK, I THINK THAT THE TWO OF\nTHEM, BANNON AND KELLY ANN ARE R GOOD FORCE.\nBECAUSE TRUMP HAS HAD A PROBLEM CONVINCING PEOPLE LIKE MY FRIEND GUY HERE THAT THEY SHOULD JOIN\nTHE CAMPAIGN. WE NEED MORE REPUBLICANS, THAT\nIS WHERE HE IS GOING TO DO  COR BETTER.\nAND BY HAVINGVES, BANNON AND KE ANN, TWO HARD CORE\nCONSERVATIVES, I THINK HE WILL SEND A MESSAGE.\n>> ENRERICK, WAS THAT SARCASM? >> NO, B GUY AND I ARE VERY GOO\nFRIENDS, SOUNDS TO ME LIKE HE IS COMING ELECT ALONG?\n>> ARE YOU COMING ALONG? >> WE'RE ON THE SAME SIDE\nAGAINST HILLARY CLINTON,HAVEOO S FOR SURE.\n>> YOU MADE THAT POINT CLEAR, BUT NONE OF IT DOES ANY GOOD IF\nWE DON'T SEEIF ANY CHANGE IN THH POLLS WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE TA\nACCURATE OR MATTER WE'LLLK TALKT ABOUT THAT LATER IN THE SHOW. RK\nBUT THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE TO WORK OFF OF RIGHT NOW AND THE\nMOMENTUM HAS BEENN IN FAVOR OF HILLARY CLINTON, HAS IT NOT?HI\n>> IT HAS, BUT YOU KNOW, I THINT I GUESS I DISAGREES ABOUT IT  I\nBEING GREATS TO TALK FROM THE  N TELEPROMPTER.\nDONALD TRUMP IS 70 YEARS OLD.  O YOU GET WHAT YOU GET. IT,\nYOU EITHER LIKE IT, LOVE IT, T WANT MORE OF IT OR GO TO SUPPORO\nSOMEBODY ELSE. HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T HIRE THE ME\nFOUNDER OF SESAME STREET THIS WEEK WITH MR. BANNON, I THINK H.\nWILL GO BACK TO PLAYING TO HIS BASE NOT THOSE WHO WILL EVER\nVOTE FOR HIM. JUST IN ALL HONESTY, IT IS A\nNUMBERS GAME, A MATRIX GAME,  D BRING OUT THEO. GLOVES --\n>> ARE YOU TRYING TO JUMP IN --R GIVE YOUR E.FRIEND, GUY, THE LA\nWORD HERE. . >> THERE IS SO MUCH TO RESPOND\nTO. I THINK LET'S RECONVENE ON THIS\nPROGRAM TWOR WEEKS FROM NOW AND. SEE HOW WE LOOK BACK ON THE HO\nPIVOT. THERE ARE A ARE LOT OF REPUBLICT\nDOWN TICKET FROM DONALD TRUMP WHO ARE IS PRAYING ON THEIR KNET\nEVERY NIGHT THAT THIS TRULY IS A NEW TRUMP.\n>> GUY, DID YOU JUST INVITE YOURSELF BACK ONTO THE SHOW?\n>> NO,O, I WOULDN'T WANT TO\nPRESUME. BUT IT CAN BE DISCUSSED BY\nSOMEONE ON THE SHOW, HOW ABOUT THAT?\n>> YOU'RE A FRIEND OF THE SHOW. ALL RIGHT,T,AT.T THANK YOU FOR G\nUS TO ALL O O THREE OF YOU TONI",

THE DEMOCRAT HAS A LEAD NOW\nAMONG THIS CONSTITUENCY. YOU CANNOT WIN NORTH CAROLINA IF\nYOU'RE GETTING CRUSHED IN THIS ELECTORATE.\nTHAT WAS NORTH CAROLINA. A STATE HE MUST WIN.\nIT'S VERY SIMILAR IN A STATE LIKE VIRGINIA, A STATE THAT\nDONALD TRUMP MIGHT HAVE TO WIN. TIM KAINE, HILLARY CLINTON'S\nRUNNING MATE, IS FROM THERE. SHE'S HAD A CONSISTENT LEAD IN\nVIRGINIA. SHE HAS A LEAD IN NORTH\nCAROLINA. SHE HAS A SIMILAR PRETTY\nCOMFORTABLE LEAD IN COLORADO. WHAT DO THESE STATES HAVE IN\nCOMMON? A VERY IMPORTANT CONSTITUENCY IS\nCOLLEGE-EDUCATED WHITES. PART OF THE GROWING POPULATION\nIN THE SUBURBS, THE RESEARCH AREAS, THE HIGH-TECH AREAS OF\nALL THESE SWING STATES. A REPUBLICAN CONSTITUENCY IN\n2012. IT HAS BEEN A REPUBLICAN\nCONSTITUENCY TRADITIONALLY. LEANING CLINTON'S WAY NOW.\nIF DONALD TRUMP CAN'T CHANGE THAT, HILLARY CLINTON WILL WIN\nTHE ELECTION. >> THAT'S A HEADACHE THAT NO ONE\nWANTS RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF NOT WINNING A GROUP YOU NEED TO WIN,\nRIGHT? RYAN LIZZA IS BACK WITH ME.\nWHY IS HE NOT DOING BETTER WITH THIS GROUP?\n>> WELL, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF POSITIONS HE'S TAKEN THAT THIS\nTRADITIONALLY REPUBLICAN GROUP IS NOT THAT ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT,\nRIGHT? WHETHER IT'S HIS TALK ON\nECONOMICS AND TRADE, THIS IS A GROUP FRANKLY IN THOSE STATES\nLIKE COLORADO, VIRGINIA, AND NORTH CAROLINA.\nTHIS IS A GROUP OF WINNERS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE GLOBAL ECONOMY\nAND WE TALK ABOUT INTERNATIONAL TRADE DEALS, RIGHT?\nTHESE ARE GROUPS THAT HAVE ACTUALLY DONE WELL BECAUSE OF\nGLOBALIZATION. THAT'S ONE THING.\nTHIS IS A GROUP, YOU KNOW, MORE EDUCATED VOTERS WHO FRANKLY ARE\nNOT PLEASED WITH THE RHETORIC THAT IS COMING FROM TRUMP THAT\nIS ALIENATING TO NON-WHITE VOTERS.\nTHERE'S ONE ARGUMENT ABOUT TRUMP'S OUTREACH TO BLACK VOTERS\nTHIS WEEK THAT IS HE'S NOT SO MUCH LOOKING FOR THE VOTES OF\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS S BUT HE'S TRYING TO PROVE TO\nCOLLEGE-EDUCATED REPUBLICANS WHO WERE TURNED OFF BY THIS THAT\nHE'S NOT RACIST. FRANKLY, WE SAW THAT WITH GEORGE\nW. BUSH IN 2000. A LOT OF TALK ABOUT HOW THIS IS\nNOT -- IT'S CALLED A BANK SHOT STRATEGY.\nYOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY TRYING TO APPEAL TO THE GROUP YOU'RE\nTALKING TO. YOU'RE TRYING TO APPEAL TO\nANOTHER GROUP THAT LIKES THE FACT YOU'RE REACHING OUT TO THAT\nGROUP. >> IF THAT'S THE CASE, THAT\nWOULD EXPLAIN WHY HE'S MADE THESE SPEECHES IN FRONT OF\nALMOST WHOLLY WHILE AUDIENCES. SOME OF THE PEOPLE YOU BRING UP,\nLOOK AT DAN ACKERSON, THE FORMER CEO OF GENERAL MOTORS, A\nREPUBLICAN WHO HAS COME OUT AGAINST TRUMP THIS WEEK.\nOR MEG WHITMAN, A REPUBLICAN WHO IS NOW BACKING CLINTON.\nTHOSE ARE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, COLLEGE EDUCATED WHITE\nVOTERS, BUSINESS LEADERS. >> ABSOLUTELY.\nAND THIS IS A CONSTITUENCY THAT IF TRUMP IS THE FUTURE OF THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY, AND HE'S -- TRUMPISM AND THESE TYPES OF THE\nCOALITION THAT HE IS TAPPING INTO, THIS IS A BIG CHANGE IF\nTHE DEMOCRATIC PARTY BECOMES MORE OF THE PARTY OF\nCOLLEGE-EDUCATED INDEPENDENTS WHO LEAN REPUBLICAN BUT ARE OPEN\nTO THE DEMOCRATS. THAT'S A BIG CHANGE.\nALREADY, THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS AN ADVANTAGE IN THE\nPRESIDENTIAL RACE BECAUSE OF THE ELECTORAL MAP, AND BECAUSE OF\nNONWHITE VOTERS, ASIAN AMERICANS AND HISPANICS, TWO OF THE\nFASTEST GROWING GROUPS. IF THEY ADD A BIG CHUNK OF\nCOLLEGE-AGED FORMERLY REPUBLICANS, THAT IS DISASTER\nFOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. >> I MEAN, RON BROWNSTEIN OF THE\nATLANTIC PUT IT THIS WAY, THAT REALLY STRUCK ME.\n13 MILLION VOTES OR SO IN THE PRIMARIES, WHAT HE GOT.\nTHE PATH FROM THAT TO THE 70 MILLION PLUS HE NEEDS TO WIN THE\nGENERAL IS AS RON PUT IT, LINED WITH COLLEGE-EDUCATED VOTERS,\nMILLENNIALS, PEOPLE OF COLOR, UNMARRIED WOMEN, SECULAR VOTERS,\nAND THIS IS SUCH A KEY C COMPONENT.\nWE'RE STILL 80 DAYS OUT AND HE'S GOT A COMPLETELY NEW CAMPAIGN\nSTAFF. KELLYANNE CONWAY, SHE'S\nINCREDIBLY GOOD AT WHAT SHE DOES AND INCREDIBLY GOOD AT\nFUND-RAISING WITH SOME OF THE BIG MONEY DONORS.\nCAN HE TURN IT AROUND? >> I THINK IT'S TOUGH, FRANKLY.\nTHERE ARE THREE BIG MOMENT IN A CAMPAIGN WHERE EVERYONE PAYS\nATTENTION AND IT REALLY HELPS DEFINE THE CANDIDATE AND THE\nCAMPAIGN. THE FIRST IS YOUR PICK OF YOUR\nVICE PRESIDENT. AND THAT ROLL-OUT DID NOT GO SO\nWELL FOR TRUMP. THE SECOND IS YOUR CONVENTION.\nAND JUST BY THE DATA, WE KNOW THAT CONVENTION WAS NOT A\nSUCCESS. MORE PEOPLE SAID THEY DO NOT\nWANT TO SUPPORT TRUMP AFTER THE CONVENTION THAN SAID THEY WERE\nCONVINCED TO SUPPORT HIM. THAT'S 0 FOR 2 IN THE TWO\nBIGGEST MOMENTS YOU HAVE. THE NEXT THING IS THE DEBATES.\nI BELIEVE THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT CAN TURB IT AROUND FOR\nTRUMP. THE DEBATES, THERE ARE FOUR OF\nTHOSE. THREE AT THE PRESIDENTIAL LEVEL,\nTWO AT THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL LEVEL, AND THE OTHER THING IS\nSOME DRAMATIC OUTSIDE EVENT THAT NONE OF US IS EXPECTED THAT\nCOMES ALONG AND SHAKES UP THE CAMPAIGN.\nOUTSIDE OF THAT, IT'S REALLY, REALLY HARD FOR HIM TO CHANGE\nTHE NUMBERS AMONG THESE KEY GROUPS.\nSO I WOULD LOOK TO THE DEBATES AS THE BIG GAME CHANGER FOR HIM,\nIF HE'S GOING TO DO IT. >> WHO IS GOING TO BE WATCHING\nTHE DEBATES? >> IT'S GOING TO BE MASSIVE.\nI MEAN, THE RATINGS FOR THOSE DEBATES --\n>> I KNOW. >> THE BIGGEST IN HISTORY.\nYOU HAVE TO EXPECT. >> WE'LL BE ALL OVER IT.\nWE KNOW TRUMP, KELLYANNE CONWAY SAID TRUMP IS STARTING DEBATE\nPREP THIS WEEKEND.

IN ELECTIONS LIKE THESE WHERE\nTHINGS ARE UNPREDICTABLE, IT'S GOING TO WORK IN THE FAVOR OF\nTHE DEMOCRATS AND WE COULD SEE A WAVE TOWARDS THEM AS A REACTION\nTO WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING.

THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT.\nIF THEY CUT OFF THE NOMINEE AS WE GET CLOSER TO THE ELECTION,\nTHEN IT'S GOING TO SINK HIS POLL NUMBERS AND THAT'S GOING TO\nBRING EVERYONE DOWN WITH IT. YOU CAN ONLY RUN SO FAR AHEAD OF\nTHE TOP OF THE TICKET. THEY NEED TO STABILIZE THE\nNUMBERS. THE NUMBERS ARE GETTING BETTER.\nTHAT NEEDS TO BE THE FOCUS, KEEPING HIM ON MESSAGE, MAKING\nSURE THERE AREN'T ANY OTHER GAFFES OR FEUDS WITH HILLARY\nCLINTON.

THERE IS RESIDUE.\nAND THAT'S BEING GENEROUS OF THE BIRTHER MOVEMENT FROM 2011.\nSTILL HOLDING OVER TO THIS CHOICE BETWEEN HILLARY CLINTON\nAND DONALD TRUMP. I WANT PEOPLE TO REMEMBER WHAT\nHAPPENED FOR THOSE SEVERAL WEEKS WHEN DONALD TRUMP WAS PUSHING\nTHIS LINE OF THE PRESIDENT'S CITIZENSHIP.\nWATCH. >> WHY DOESN'T HE SHOW HIS BIRTH\nCERTIFICATE? WHY HAS HE SPENT OVER $2 MILLION\nIN LEGAL FEES TO KEEP THIS QUIET AND TO KEEP THIS SILENT?\nI WANT HIM TO SHOW HIS BIRTH CERTIFICATE.\nTHERE IS SOMETHING ON THAT BIRTH CERTIFICATE HE DOESN'T LIKE.\nI FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT THE FACT THAT BARACK OBAMA SHOULD GIVE\nHIS BIRTH CERTIFICATE.

YOU STILL HAVE PEOPLE -- THERE\nARE POLLS BEING DONE. IS PRESIDENT OBAMA A U.S.\nCITIZEN, WAS HE LEGALLY BORN IN THE U.S. SOMEWHERE.\nAND THEY'RE LIKE, NO. SO YOU STILL HEAR PEOPLE SAY\nTHAT.

IT'S A PROBLEM BUT ALSO\nINTERESTING, YOU HAVE PEOPLE LIKE TED CRUZ, NO ONE TALKS\nABOUT, YOU KNOW, ABOUT HIS BIRTH.\nTHE REPUBLICAN PARTY WANTED TO PLAY THAT DOWN THIS YEAR FOR\nTHIS ELECTION CYCLE. AT THE SAME TIME, IT'S STILL AS\nYOU SAY IN THE BEST OF TERMS I GUESS YOU WOULD SAY THE RESIDUE\nSTILL LINGERS.

WE'VE BEEN SO BUSY, YOU KNOW.\n>> DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT IN HIS EFFORT TO GET\nBLACK VOTERS TO -- FOR SOME MEA CULPA OR SOME EXPLANATION.\nHE CALLED THE PRESIDENT, 93% OF THE VOTERS VOTED FOR PRESIDENT\nOBAMA. >> IN 2007, THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN, HILLARY CLINTON STARTED THAT WHISPER CAMPAIGN\nABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S BIRTH CERTIFICATE.\nTHAT DID NOT COME -- NO, SIR. THAT CAME --\n>> THE BIRTHER WAS DONALD TRUMP. >> NO, SIR.\n>> DID DONALD TRUMP NOT PUT UP A $5 BILLION BOUNTY --\n>> THAT CAME FROM THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN BACK IN 2007.\nALONG WITH BIDEN, THE WHISPER. >> THEY DID NOT WANT -- THAT WAS\nPART OF THEIR STRATEGY TO BEAT HIM IN 2008 THAT CAME FROM\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN. >> LET ME ASK YOU THESE\nQUESTIONS. DONALD TRUMP, DID HE OR DID HE\nNOT PUT UP A MULTIMILLION DOLLAR BOUNTY FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE\nPRESIDENT'S BIRTH CERTIFICATE IN HAWAII?\n>> I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.\nI DON'T. >> THE LAST QUESTION, HOW WILL\nHE GET BLACK VOTERS? HE'S AT 1% IN THE LATEST POLL.\n>> IF YOU NOTICED THE OTHER DAY, TWO DAYS AGO, BREITBART CAME OUT\nWITH 6%. HERE IN ATLANTA WE'RE AT 6% AND\nCLIMBING.

THERE'S A CONCERNED SENSE THAT\nTHEY DO VOTE IS FOR CONSERVATIVES.\nTHEY DON'T DO IT IN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.\nA CANDIDATE WHO CHARGED RACIALLY SPREAD FICTION ABOUT MINORITIES\nIN THE PAST, I DON'T THINK HE CAN TURN IT AROUND BY SAYING YOU\nHAVE TO LOSE. HE WILL HAVE TO COME UP WITH A\nMUCH BIGGER PIVOT. >> WHAT EXACTLY CAN SHE HELP\nWITH IF HE ULTIMATELY DOES NOT WANT TO CHANGE HIS WAYS?\n>> ONE REASON KELLYANNE CONWAY WAS PERHAPS BROUGHT IN IS TRUMP\nLISTENS TO HER MORE THAN PAUL MANAFORT, WHO HAS JUST BEEN\nOUSTED. SHE HAS A LONG HISTORY WORKING\nWITH REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES. I THINK SHE WOULD BE EXPECTED TO\nRECOMMEND OREN COURAGE DONALD TRUMP IN THAT MORE CONVENTIONAL\nTRACK. AS YOU SAY, HE'S A VERY\nIMTETUOUS. THAT LIMITS ANY CAMPAIGN ADVISER\nTO REALLY KEEP HIM ON THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW.\n>> WITH THAT IN MIND, JANE, YOU HAVE THE HARDEST QUESTION OF THE\nDAY. WHAT'S THE CALCULATION BEHIND\nTHE STEVE BANNON HIRE CONSIDERING HE HAS OVER WHITE\nSUPREMACISTS. IS THIS THE GUY YOU COUNTERACT\nTHAT WITH? >> NO HIRING STEVE BANNON TAKES\nOW THE PERK THAT HE MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN FROM HIRING KELLYANNE\nCONWAY. HE IS KNOWN FOR STARTING\nPOLITICAL FIRES. TRUMP IS GOING TO BE TRUMP.\nHE IS GOING TO KEEP STARTING THE FIRES LIKE HE HAS DONE THE LAST\n18 MONTHS. >> JANE AND NILE, THANK YOU FOR\nJOINING US.",

BUT YOU'RE SAYING THAT'S\nACTUALLY TARGETING WHITE PEOPLE TO MAKE THEM THINK HE'S LESS OF\nA BIGOT AND IF YOU SUPPORT HIM, YOU'RE NOT A RACIST?\n>> EXACTLY.

A NUMBER OF OTHERS RUNNING\nDOUBLE DIGITS AHEAD OF DONALD TRUMP.\nAND THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK THEY CAN'T CONTINUE TO DO THAT.\n>> BUT IN SOME STATES YOU'RE SEEING REPUBLICAN SENATE\nCANDIDATES RUN AHEAD OF DONALD TRUMP BUT FIVE POINTS, SIX\nPOINTS, PAT TOOMEY IN PENNSYLVANIA.\nTHEY COULD AFFORD A FIVE, SIX POINT TRUMP UNDERTOE IN A STATE.\nBUT 10, 12 BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT TO OVERCOME.\nWOULDN'T YOU AGREE WITH THAT? >> I WOULD SAY IT'S A CHALLENGE\nBUT LET'S NOT FORGET, IN THE SOUTH IN THE 1970s AND '80s\nDEMOCRATIC SENATORS FREQUENTLY WON OVERWHELMING VICTIMS AT THE\nSAME TIME THAT GEORGE McGOVERN WAS CRATERING IN 1972 AND WALTER\nMONDALE IN 1984 THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH.\nTHEY RAN WELL, WELL AHEAD THE TOP OF THE TICKET BECAUSE THEY\nRAN THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT CAMPAIGNS.\nTHAT'S WHAT REPUBLICAN INCUMBENTS ARE DOING THIS YEAR.\n>> HOW ARE THEY DOING THAT RUNNING AN INDEPENDENT CAMPAIGN?\nHOW DO YOU MAKE A CAMPAIGN LIKE THE SENATE WHICH IS USUALLY --\nYOU DON'T HEAR AS MUCH ABOUT WHEN IT'S A PRESIDENTIAL YEAR\nBECAUSE THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE GETS ALL THE ATTENTION FROM THE\nFREE MEDIA. HOW DO YOU LIFT THE CAMPAIGN UP\nSO THE REPUBLICAN VOTERS WHO MIGHT BE SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE TOP\nOF THE TICKET SAY YOU KNOW WHAT, I GOT TO VOTE FOR THAT SENATE\nCANDIDATE? >> THREE WORDS.\nLOCALIZE, LOCALIZE, LOCALIZE. THE SENATORS NEED TO MAKE A\nCOMPELLING CASE THAT THEIR SERVICE IN THE SENATE HAS MADE\nLIFE BETTER FOR THE CONSTITUENTS IN THEIR STATES.\nIF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE CANDIDATES ARE DOING WITH MARCO\nRUBIO ON THE ZIKA VIRUS, ROB PORTMAN ABOUT THE OPIATE\nEPIDEMIC, THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT LOCAL ISSUES AND HOW THEIR\nSERVICE HAS MADE LIFE BETTER FOR PEOPLE IN THEIR STATE.\n>> I'M ALSO HEARING AT THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN FIGURES\nSAYING IF WE GO INTO SEPTEMBER AND DONALD TRUMP IS STILL\nTRAILING BADLY IN THE POLLS, THAT WHAT YOU'LL SEE ARE THE\nNATIONAL CAMPAIGN COMMITTEES SHIFT RESOURCES TO THE HOUSE AND\nSENATE RACES. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN OCTOBER\nAS YOU KNOW OF 1996 WITH BOB DOLE.\nDOES THAT HAVE TO HAPPEN THIS YEAR AS WELL AND HOW EARLY?\n>> IT MAY VERY WELL HAPPEN THIS YEAR, PAUL.\nWE'LL HAVE TO TALK WITH THE OFFICIALS IN CHARGE OF THAT.\nLET ME GIVE YOU ONE DATA POINT FROM 1996.\nBOB DOLE LOST TO BILL CLINTON. THE AVERAGE REPUBLICAN HOUSE\nINCUMBENT RAN 16 POINTS AHEAD OF BOB DOLE IN THAT YEAR AND LOST\nONLY FIVE SEATS. THERE IS A RECORD OF PEOPLE\nDOING THIS IN DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENTS AND THAT'S WHY I'M\nMORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE REPUBLICANS HOLDING THE HOUSE.\n>> THEY'RE GOING TO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY.\n>> YES. >> WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT?\n>> OF COURSE. OF COURSE.\n>> ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING\nHERE. WE'LL SEE IF YOU'RE RIGHT.\n>> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU. >> WHEN WE COME BACK, WITH THE\n2016 OLYMPICS WRAPPING UP, A LOOK AT THE HIGHS AND THE LOWS\nOF THE RIO GAMES.",

IN FACT, HE'S BEEN SPENDING A\nLOT OF TIME IN STATES THAT DON'T EXACTLY HAVE A HISTORY OF VOTING\nREPUBLICAN. WISCONSIN HASN'T GONE RED SINCE\n1984 AND CURRENT POLLS ARE NOT EXACTLY IN HIS FAVOR.\nTHE REAL CLEAR POLITICS AVERAGE OF RECENT BADGER STATE POLLS HAS\nTRUMP DOWN BY ALMOST TEN POINTS. DOES TRUMP HAVE A CHANCE TO\nCHANGE THE CONVERSATION? VICKI McKENNA FROM THE GREAT\nCITY OF MADISON, WISCONSIN. NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN, VICKI.\n>> GREAT TO BE HERE AGAIN. AND DONALD TRUMP'S GOT SOME WORK\nTO DO IN OUR GREAT STATE. >> YOU KNOW, YOU CORRECTLY\nPREDICTED THAT TED CRUZ WAS GOING TO WIN IN WISCONSIN DURING\nTHE PRIMARY. WHAT'S YOUR PREDICTION HERE FOR\nTHE GENERAL? >> WELL, IF THE ELECTION WERE\nHELD TOMORROW DONALD TRUMP WOULD LOSE WISCONSIN.\nBUT THE ELECTION ISN'T TOMORROW, SO HE'S GOT SOME OPPORTUNITIES,\nHE'S GOT SOME TIME. LOOK, I THINK HE CAN WIN OVER\nTHE REPUBLICANS IN WISCONSIN. SHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE SOME\nCHANGES. BUT I DON'T KNOW IF HE CAN WIN\nTHE STATE, ONLY BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, AS YOU MENTIONED, HISTORY\nIS AGAINST HIM. HE HASN'T REALLY BEEN DOING MUCH\nIN WISCONSIN TO ALTER THE MESSAGE ENOUGH TO TRY TO MAKE\nHIMSELF BROAD APPEAL LIKE SCOTT WALKER HAS BEEN AS GOVERNOR OF\nOUR STATE. SO I THINK IT'S A TOUGH SLOG FOR\nHIM. I THINK HE'S GOT TO SHORE UP\nSOME REPUBLICAN SUPPORT FIRST BECAUSE HE'S NOT EVEN THERE WITH\nTHE REPUBLICANS YET IN OUR STATE.\n>> YOU SAY THAT AND IT'S KIND OF INTERESTING BECAUSE IF YOU\nLISTEN TO TRUMP ON THE STUMP HE WILL BE TELL YOU THAT BLUE\nCOLLAR REAGAN DEMOCRATS OF WHICH YOU GOT A LOT OF IN WISCONSIN,\nARE GOING TO GO BIG FOR HIM. WHY DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S\nTRANSLATING? WHY IS HIS MESSAGE NOT\nTRANSLATING WITH THOSE FOLKS IN  THAT CALL IN TO YOUR SHOW?\n>> WELL, IT'S BECAUSE SO FAR HE HASN'T REALLY HAD MUCH OF A\nDIFFERENT MESSAGE IN WISCONSIN. LOOK, WISCONSIN REPUBLICANS ARE\nA PRETTY INTELLIGENT BUNCH OF REPUBLICANS.\nTHEY'RE VERY ACTIVIST. THEY'RE VERY, VERY WELL\nINFORMED. WE HAVE SOUTS EASTERN WISCONSIN\nTHAT IS JUST BLANKETED WITH TALK RADIO.\nWE HAVE REPUBLICANS THAT DON'T SEEK OUT THEIR INFORMATION FROM\nTHE MAINSTREAM PRESS. WE HAVE REPUBLICANS THAT YOU\nCAN'T JUST FLY THE IN, POP IN EVERY NOW AND AGAIN, PAT THEM ON\nTHE HEAD AND SAY YOU'RE EXACTLY LIKE MICHIGAN.\nWE'RE GOING TO TREAT YOU LIKE MICHIGAN.\nYOU'RE EXACTLY LIKE INDIANA, WE'LL TREAT YOU LIKE THAT.\nWISCONSIN REPUBLICANS ARE DIFFERENT.\nWE'VE GONE THROUGH THE WARS AND BATTLES FOR OUR GOVERNOR IN\nRECALL ELECTIONS. WE DO ACTIVISM A BIT\nDIFFERENTLY. AND I THINK HE'S ACTUALLY GOING\nTO HAVE TO RESPECT THE FACT THAT WE KNOW A LOT MORE ABOUT OUR\nSTATE THAN HE DOES. >> YOU THINK ABOUT FOLKS WHO\nKNOW A LOT ABOUT YOUR STATE. TWO PEOPLE, SCOTT WALKER WHO IS\nOBVIOUSLY WON THREE ELECTIONS ALTHOUGH H DIDN'T HAVE BROAD\nNATIONAL APPEAL. HE HASN'T REALLY COME OUT THAT\nSTRONG FOR DONALD TRUMP. CERTAINLY ISN'T OUT WORKING FOR\nHIM. THE OTHER PERSON IS PAUL RYAN\nWHO TROUNCED HIS PRO-TRUMP PRIMARY CHALLENGER.\n>> I TELL YOU WHAT'S GOING ON. RIGHT NOW CONGRESSMAN RYAN AND\nGOVERNOR WALKER, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE DOING WHAT THEY CAN\nGIVEN WHAT THEY'VE GOT TO WORK WITH IN TERMS OF A CANDIDATE.\nI NO WE THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS SWITCHED OVER HIS MANAGEMENT\nTEAM. IN THE LAST THREE DAYS HIS\nMESSAGING HAS BEEN MUCH, MUCH BETTER AND MUCH, MUCH MORE\nAMENABLE TO THE EARS OF WISCONSIN VOTERS.\nFING HE STAY ON MESSAGE LIKE HE HAS BEEN, GOING INTO WEST BEND,\nTALKING ABOUT CITY ISSUES, GOING INTO DOWNTOWN MILWAUKEE AND\nACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT THE THINGS THAT WE IN WISCONSIN TALK\nAND CARE ABOUT, I THINK YOU MAY SEE GOVERNOR WALKER AND\nCONGRESSMAN RYAN BE A LITTLE MORE ENTHOOSS A TICK.\nBUT THESE ARE REFOR MINDED REPUBLICANS.\nDEEP POLICY REPUBLICANS. AND UNLESS THEY SEE A LITTLE BIT\nMORE GAME FROM DONALD TRUMP HERE, I'M NOT SURE YOU'RE GOING\nTO SEE THEM BE ABLE TO BE SORT OF THE ENTHUIASTIC CHEERLEADERS\nTHEY WERE FOR MITT ROMNEY, FOR JOHN McCAIN.\nI THINK DONALD TRUMP CAN CHANGE THAT AND I THINK HIS LAST THREE\nDAYS IN OUR STATE HAS BEEN VERY, VERY POSITIVE FOR HIM.\n>> YOU THINK ABOUT THE WAY WISCONSIN VOTED, 2000, 2004, IT\nWAS VERY, VERY CLOSE TO BUSH WINNING WISCONSIN.\nHE DIDN'T BUT HE GOT MUCH CLOSER THAN ANYBODY HAS SINCE GOING\nBACK TO 1984. LAST QUESTION FOR YOU.\nINTERESTING PIECE IN THE ATLANTIC, DISCUSSING THE FACT\nTHAT WHERE DONALD TRUMP DOES WELL IS NOT IN CITIES AND TOWNS\nTHAT ARE PARTICULARLY BAD OFF BUT, RATHER, CITIES AND TOWNS\nTHAT ARE INDUSTRIAL, THAT HAVE SEEN A LITTLE BIT OF A\nRESURGENCE. WHERE IS WISCONSIN ON THAT\nSPECTRUM? I KNOW IT'S A BIG STATE BUT\nSTILL, IS WISCONSIN REALLY STILL HURTING OR HAS THINGS GOTTEN\nESPECIALLY BETTER THERE, DO YOU THINK?\n>> I THINK THINGS HAVE GOTTEN SUBSTANTIALLY BETTER HERE,\nPARTICULARLY WITH THE ELECTION OF GOVERNOR WALKER AND KEY\nCHANGES. WE ARE NOW IN THE TOP TIER\nLEADING MANUFACTURING STATES. WE HAVE SEEN OUR BUDGET\nSITUATION TURN AROUND. OUR INCOMES ARE ACTUALLY COMING\nBACK ONLINE. WE'VE SEEN SALES TAX REVENUE\nINCREASE, WHICH MEANS CONSUMERS ARE BUYING MORE.\nYOU KNOW THE ECONOMIC SITUATION IS -- I WOULD SAY IN THE LAST\nSIX YEARS HAS GOTTEN BETTER HERE IN WISCONSIN, ESPECIALLY GIVEN\nWE'VE COME OUT OF RECESSION. BUT LISTEN, I THINK DONALD\nTRUMP'S BIGGEST CHALLENGE IN OUR STATE IS GOING TO BE TAKE THAT\n79% OF REPUBLICAN ENTHOOS AM THAT HE'S GOT NATIONALLY AND\nPROBABLY ABOUT THE SAME HERE AND TURN THAT INTO 90% ENTHUSIASM.\nTHAT ALL HS TO DO WITH MESSAGING.\n>> VICKI INGVICKI, THERE'S A LO REPUBLICANS WHO LISTEN TO YOUR\nRADIO SHOW. I'VE GOTTEN SECONDS.\nDO YOU THINK DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO COME ON AS HE DOES\nLOCAL RADIO AND DO YOUR SHOW OR NOT?\n>> DONALD TRUMP IS WELCOME TO COME BACK ON MY PROGRAM ANY\nTIME. HE CAN COLD CALL ME AND I'LL\nTAKE THE CALL. >> WELL, WE'LL SEE IF IT\nHAPPENS. IF IT DOES, COME BACK AND CHAT\nWITH US ABOUT IT.

A FEDERAL JUDGE RULED CLINTON\nMUST RESPOND TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS FROM JUDICIAL WATCH,\nTHE CONSERVATIVE GROUP LEADING THE CHARGE INTO THE E-MAIL\nSCANDAL. IN A STATEMENT THE JUDICIAL\nWATCH PRESIDENT SAID, QUOTE, WE WILL MOVE QUICKLY TO GET THESE\nANSWERS. THE DECISION IS A REMINDER THAT\nHILLARY CLINTON IS NOT ABOVE THE LAW.\nONE CLINTON SPOKESPERSON DISMISSED THE RULING AS JUST\nANOTHER LAWSUIT INTENDED TO HURT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN BUT\nCOMBINED WITH CONFLICT OF INTEREST CONCERNS OVER HER\nFAMILY FOUNDATION CLINTON HAS A LOT OF QUESTIONS TO ANSWER.\nTHAT BEING SAID, PAID TO PLAY, PLAY FOR PAY, RATHER,\nALLEGATIONS ARE NOTHING NEW FOR THE CLINTONS BUT THE CONTROVERSY\nOVER WHO IS GIVING TO THEIR CHARITIES AND WHY IT'S\nFESTERING. HERE'S WHY IT MATTERS.\nWHEN A FOREIGN DONOR GIVES MONEY TO CHARITIES RUN BY THE FAMILY\nOF WOMAN WHO COULD BECOME THE NEXT PRESIDENT, IT CREATES AN\nOBVIOUS APPEARANCE OF A POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST.\n>> SO WHAT IF ANY FAVORS DOES THAT DONOR, THAT FOREIGN DONOR\nYOU WERE TALKING ABOUT, EXPECT TO GET IN RETURN?\nAVOIDING SUCH CONFLICTS IS WHY PRESIDENT CLINTON SAYS HE AND\nDAUGHTER CHELSEA WILL STEP AWAY FROM THEIR FOUNDATION AND\nSHUTTER FOREIGN DONOR OPERATION IT IS MRS. CLINTON WINS IN\nNOVEMBER. ESTIMATED $2 BILLION BUDGET THE\nVARIOUS CLINTON CHARITIES ARE ADVANCING THE GLOBAL AGENDA,\nPROVIDING ACCESS TO HIV/AIDS TREATMENT, SEED MONEY FOR\nSUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN AFRICA, AND FIGHTING CLIMATE\nCHANGE. OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF FOLK ON THE\nOTHER SIDE SAYING THE CLINTON FOUNDATION IS ABOUT SO MUCH\nMORE. THEY ALSO FUND EFFORTS HERE AT\nHOME TO END CHILDHOOD OBESITY, AN ISSUE CLOSE TO MICHELLE\nOBAMA'S HEART. ONE OF THE BIG QUESTIONS HERE IS\nIF THEIR APPEARS TO BE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST IF HILLARY\nCLINTON WINS DOESN'T THERE BE THAT SAME APPEARANCE OF A\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST, SAY, WHEN SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE?\nAND TO THAT END, PERHAPS, NEXT MONTH THE CLINTON GLOBAL\nINITIATIVE HOLDS ITS AN YUN DONOR MEETING IN NEW YORK.\nNOW, ACCORDING TO THE FOUNDATION, ON THE LITERATURE\nWILL BE ABOUT HOW TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN PROSPERITY THROUGH WHAT\nTHEY CALL THE POWER OF PARTNERSHIP.\nHOW DOES THIS ALL PLAY IN THE NARRATIVE OF HILLARY CLINTON\nRUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AND PERHAPS EVEN FOREIGN DONORS WHO\nCAN GIVE MONEY TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION RIGHT NOW.\n>> IT'S BEEN OVER A YEAR SINCE NEWS OF HILLARY CLINTON'S\nPRIVATE E-MAIL SERVICE FIRST BROKE.\nALTHOUGH VOTERS POLLED SAY SHE'S NOT TRUSTWORTHY SHE'S STILL\nLEADING IN THE POLLS BUT NOT LESS THAN THREE MONTHS FROM\nVOTING DAYS WILL QUESTIONS OVER HER E-MAILS AND THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION PACK THE ONE-TWO PUNCH THAT TRUMP HOPES FOR?\nSO HERE TO WEIGH IN DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGN STRATEGIST AND FOX NEWS\nCONTRIBUTOR JOE TRIPPY. JOE, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR\nJOINING US. WE HEARD LELAND EARLIER.\nHE PLAYED A CLIP FROM A CAMPAIGN AD.\nI WANT TO START FIRST AND FOREMOST BY PLAYING A CAMPAIGN\nAD AND GETTING YOUR REACTION IF YOU DON'T MIND LISTENING.\n>> SURE. >> WE GOT TO WORK BECAUSE OTHERS\nDEPEND ON US. HILLARY CLINTON GETS IT,\nSTANDING UP F FAMILIES AND CHILDREN HAS BEEN HER LIFE'S\nWORK. UNDER HER PLAN WORKING PARENTS\nGET RELIEF FROM THE COST OF CHILD CARE AND A PATH TO DEBT\nFREE COLLEGE. >> JOE, WHO IS THAT APPEALING\nTO? >> RIGHT NOW PRETTY BROAD\nSPECTRUM OF THE ELECTORATE. YOU SEE HER GAINING, YOU KNOW,\nSTRENGTH SINCE HER CONVENTION WITH WOMEN IN PARTICULAR AND\nTHAT'S CLEARLY WHO THAT DRIVEN AT, AND SHE'S TRYING TO\nSTRENGTHEN HERSELF WITH BLUE COLLAR VOTERS THAT SHE DOESN'T\nHAVE RIGHT NOW AND THAT ARE UP FOR GRABS BETWEEN HER AND TRUMP.\n>> DO YOU FEEL THAT WAY, THEY ARE UP FOR GRABS?\nWE'VE HEARD THAT A LOT, THAT DONALD TRUMP MAY BE LOSING\nPEOPLE THAT HE PRESUMES ARE SUPPORTING HIM.\n>> YEAH. I MEAN, I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE\nFIGHT IS. WHEN HE'S DOING WELL, HE BREAKS\nINTO THAT CATEGORY MORE THAN A ROMNEY WOULD HAVE AND THEN HE\nGOES OFF SCRIPT OR GETS -- GOES OVER THE TOP AND HE LOSES THEM\nBACK TO HER. AND SO I THINK THAT'S -- THAT'S\nWHY YOU SEE THE FLUCTUATE -- WHEN IT'S GETTING CLOSER, IT'S\nBECAUSE HE'S ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, PULLING MORE OF THOSE BLUE\nCOLLAR WORKING FOLKS. HE NEEDS THOSE IN OHIO AND PLACES LIKE THAT AND SHE NEEDS\nTO KEEP THEM AWAY FROM HIM TO STOP HIM FROM GAINING TRACTION\nIN PLACES LIKE PENNSYLVANIA, OHIO, MICHIGAN, A LOT OF THE\nSTATES THAT IF DONALD TRUMP CAN'T WIN, YOU JUST CAN'T --\nGOP -- IF YOU CAN'T PICK OFF OHIO IT DOESN'T WORK.\n>> WE SO MUCH ABOUT TRUMP SAYING ON MESSAGE BUT THIS WEEK FOR\nHILLARY CLINTON WASN'T ROSY. SO I WANT TO ASK YOU HOW DOES\nSHE STAY ON MESSAGE BECAUSE SHE HAS TO STAY ON MESSAGE, TOO,\nWHEN WE SEE THE NEWS OUT OF DC WITH JUDICIAL WATCH AND WE SEE\nALL THE HEAD LIPS WITH THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nHOW DOES SHE MAINTAIN HER FOCUS RIGHT NOW?\n>> WELL, I MEAN, LOOK, SHE'S GOT TO BE, YOU KNOW, TAKE NOTHING\nFOR GRANTED, FIGHT FOR EVERY VOTE.\nI THINK SHE'S GOING TO DO THAT. I THINK IN THE END THIS ELECTION\nIS GOING TO COME DOWN TO -- DONALD TRUMP CAN'T GET THERE IF\nHE CAN'T GET OVER THIS FEELING THAT PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT EITHER,\nYOU KNOW, NOT RIGHT FOR THE JOB OR UNQUALIFIED OR, YOU KNOW,\nSOME OF THESE QUESTIONS THAT HE RAISED HIMSELF.\nSO SHE'S GOING TO KEEP PUSHING THAT.\nSHE'S GOING TO KEEP THE CASE GOING THAT HE'S NOT FIT TO BE\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. >> WE HAVE SOME LIVE PICTURES\nNOW OF DONALD TRUMP'S MEETING WITH LATINO LEADERS IN NEW YORK.\nSO HE'S BLATANTLY TRYING TO PROJECT THE OPTICS THAT HE'S\nREACHING OUT FAR BEYOND JUST THIS BLUE COLLAR VOTER.\nSHOULD SHE STAY ON HER TOES? IS THE CAMPAIGN IN ANY WAY BEING\nCOMPLACENT WHEN WE SEE HIM MAKING MOVES LIKE THIS.\n>> NO. ONE, THE CAMPAIGN IS NOT\nCOMPLACENT. THE OTHER THING, AND THIS IS\nSAME WITH A LOT OF REPUBLICANS AGAINST HILLARY.\nTHE FEAR, I MEAN, THE ACTUAL TERROR AMONG RANK AND FILE\nDEMOCRATS OF A TRUMP PRESIDENCY MEANS, I THINK, THAT THERE'S\nGOING TO BE A BIG TURNOUT FOR THE BASE OF THE DEMOCRATIC\nPARTY. JUST AS THE FEAR IN YOU CALL IT\nTERROR OF CLINTON PRESIDENCY ACTUALLY HELPING TRUMP.\nBUT HE STILL NEEDS TO CONSOLIDATE THAT VOTE AND HE\nHASN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO IT YET. HE'S GOT TWO PROBLEMS.\nHOW DOES HE CONSOLIDATE THE GOP VOTE THAT IS STILL A GROUP\nTHAT'S NOT THERE COMPLETELY FOR HIM, NOT THE WAY DEMOCRATS ARE\nTHERE FOR HER. AT THE SAME TIME, REACH BEYOND\nTHAT, BEYOND THE BASE TO BROADEN HIS SUPPORT.\nAND I THINK THAT'S A REAL TOUGH TIGHTROPE TO WALK WITH 80 DAYS\nLEFT. THAT'S A REAL STRUGGLE WITHIN\nHIS CAMPAIGN. >> YEAH.\nAND I THINK THAT WE CERTAINLY CAN'T PREDICT HOW THIS ELECTION\nIS GOING TO SHAKE OUT. SO IT'S GOING TO BE AN\nINTERESTING 80 DAYS. >> IT WILL BE.\n>> THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. >> THANK YOU.\n>> WE APPRECIATE IT.",

STRANGE YEAR.\n>> LET'S DIG DEEPER. LET'S BREAK DOWN IMMIGRATION.\nTEXANS CARE ABOUT THAT. I LOOKED ON DONALD TRUMP'S\nWEBSITE. WE HEARD ABOUT HIM TALK ABOUT\nBUILDING A WALL. HIS IMMIGRATION REFORM IS A\nNATION WITHOUT BORDERS IS NOT A NATION, A NATION WITHOUT LAWS IS\nNOT A NATION, AND A NATION THAT DOES NOT SERVE ITS OWN CITIZENS\nIS NOT A NATION. HOW DO THOSE PRINCIPLES NOT\nAPPLY TO TEXANS? >> THE PRINCIPLES IN THEORY\nAPPLY. WE SEE REPUBLICANS CAMPAIGNING\nON STRONG BORDER SECURITY. WITH DONALD TRUMP, BUILDING A\nBORDER WALL, I DON'T KNOW IF HE MEANS A REAL WALL OR VIRTUAL,\nBUT IT'S MORE THAN HALF THE SOUTHERN BORDER OF THE UNITED\nSTATES AND OUR BORDER IS LITERALLY A RIVER.\nYOU CAN'T BUILD A WALL ON A RIVER UNLESS YOU WANT TO DRAIN\nIT. YOU CAN'T JUST SAY BUILD A\nBORDER WALL AND HAVE IT PLAY AS GREAT POLICY HERE.\n>> PERHAPS PEOPLE ON THE GROUND WHO LIVE THERE THINK THAT IS\nPHYSICALLY NOT FEASIBLE. >> WE HAVE A MOAT.\n>> I WANT TO MOVE ON TO NAFTA. THAT'S AN ISSUE WE'VE SEEN A LOT\nOF STATES REALLY TALK ABOUT. WOULD IT REALLY BE A DISASTER TO\nREFORM, RENEGOTIATE OR BREAK SOME OF THOSE NAFTA\nRELATIONSHIPS? HOW WOULD THAT AFFECT TEXANS IN\nPARTICULAR, ESPECIALLY WITH ITS PROXIMITY TO MEXICO?\n>> TEXAS WOULD BE DISPROPORTIONATE,\nANTI-BENEFICIARY OF ANY REPEAL OR POLICY.\nMEXICO IS OUR BIGGEST TRADING PARTNER.\nTHERE ARE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN COMMERCE THAT FLOW ACROSS THE\nBORDER EVERY DAY, INCLUDING NOT JUST TRADE BUT COLLABORATION AND\nINNOVATION TOGETHER. FOR TEXAS, THE QUESTION SHOULD\nWE GET RID OF NAFTA WOULD BE A TERRIBLE IDEA FOR US. .\n>> I WANT TO MOVE ON TO TED CRUZ.\nHE'S POPULAR IN THE STATE. A LOT OF US TALKED ABOUT HIS\nAPPEARANCE AT THE CONVENTION FOR WEEKS AFTER.\nDOES THAT DAMAGE OR IMPACT ANY OF HIS SUPPORT IN THE STATE OF\nTEXAS? >> WE'VE SEEN MIXED SIGNALS IN\nPOLLING. POLLING SHOWING SENATOR CRUZ\nWITH HIGHER UNFAVORABLES WITH REPUBLICAN VOTERS.\nAS GOVERNOR RICK PERRY RAN AGAINST HIM THAT GOVERNOR PERRY\nWOULD WIN. WHILE THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE IS\nONGOING, IT'S TOO EARLY TO READ MUCH INTO THOSE RESULTS.\nTED CRUZ IS POPULAR AMONG TEXAN REPUBLICANS.\nHE WON THE PRIMARIES EASILY. THERE'S BEEN SOME INTERESTING\nSTATIC IN THE POLLS. I WOULDN'T TREAT IT AS\nCONCLUSIVE AT THIS POINT. >> WE ONLY HAVE ABOUT 30\nSECONDS. WE TALKED ABOUT IMMIGRATION,\nNAFTA AND TED CRUZ. ASIDE FROM THOSE ISSUES, AND I\nKNOW A TEXAN IS NOT A MONOLITHIC VOTE, BUT WHAT ELSE DO THEY CARE\nABOUT FROM EITHER CANDIDATE? WHAT DO THEY WANT TO SEE ON A\nPLATFORM RIGHT NOW? >> I WOULD SAY THE USUAL ISSUES\nCONSERVATIVES CARE ABOUT THAT ARE NOT BEING THAT WELL SERVED,\nPRO-LIFE ISSUES, AMENDMENT RIGHTS.\nPROPERTY RIGHTS ARE THE MAIN ISSUES.\nCONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS.

I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW, WHY\nDENY THE POLLS? SOMETIMES YOU EAT THE BEAR\nAND SOMETIMES THE BEAR EATS YOU.\nIN COHEN HAD A BAD OUTING. I THINK HE PROBABLY\nSUSPECTED THAT THE TRUMP WOULD DO WHAT THEY GENERALLY\nDONE AND LOSING CAMPAIGNS DONE THROUGHOUT HISTORY\nREFUTE. THAT POLL HAD TOO MANY\nDEMOCRATS. THAT POLL SMELLED LIKE OLD\nSKUNKS, I DON'T LIKE THIS POLL, THIS, THAT, OR THE\nOTHER THING. THE REALITY IS THERE HASN'T\nBEEN A POLL IN A LONG THAT HAS SHOWN DONALD TRUMP DOING\nANYTHING BUT TRAILING HILLARY CLINTON.\nAS LONG AS HIS CAMPAIGN DOESN'T CONFRONT THAT FACT\nWITH THEIR SUPPORTERS, IT'S GOING TO BE HARD TO MAKE THE\nCHANGES AND DO THE THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO DO.\n>> I MEAN, JASON, I KIND OF REMEMBER ON TRUMP'S WAY UP,\nEVERY SHOCKING POLL AFTER ANOTHER THAT SHOWED HIM, YOU\nKNOW, IN THE LEAD. HE CITED THOSE POLLS.\nSO WHY NOW? WHY IS HIS CAMPAIGN CHOOSING\nTO SAY THAT THE POLLS ARE WRONG?\n>> I WOULD TAKE A DIFFERENT LOOK AT IT FROM MY\nPERSPECTIVE. I DON'T THINK THEY ARE\nWRONG. I THINK IT'S MUCH TIGHTER\nRACE IN MANY PLACES THAN THE POLLS ARE SHOWING.\nPRIMARILY BECAUSE THIS IS AUGUST.\nAUGUST IS A TIME WHERE FAMILIES ARE TRYING TO\nFINISH THEIR SUMMER AND GET READY FOR SCHOOL.\nSO THEY ARE REALLY NOT, YOU KNOW, A SNAPSHOT OF WHAT IT\nIS GOING TO BE LIKE IN NOVEMBER.\nSO, I DON'T THINK THAT TRUMP IN HIS CAMPAIGN ARE\nNECESSARILY LOOKING AT THESE POLLS AND SAYING, ALL RIGHT,\nYOU KNOW, WE ARE GOING TO LOSE THIS BADLY AND WE NEED\nTO TELL OUR SUPPORTERS, I THINK WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS\nGOING TO THESE RALLIES, THEY ARE ENERGIZING PEOPLE AT\nTHESE RALLIES AND ENSURING THAT THEY ARE THE ONES TO\nGET OUT AFTER LABOR DAY TO TURN OUT THE VOTE.\nAND AS YOU HAVE SEEN OVER THE LAST WEEK, THE POLL\nNUMBERS HAVE SORT OF, HAVE GOTTEN A LITTLE BIT CLOSER.\nTHE \"L.A.

HE IS DOING SOMEWHAT BETTER.\n>> RICH, LET ME GET YOU IN HERE BECAUSE MIKE PENCE HIS\nRUNNING MATE HAS SAID MULTIPLE TIMES IN THE PAST\nWEEK OR TWO THAT IT'S STILL EARLY.\nIS THIS STILL EARLY IN THE CAMPAIGN IS THERE STILL TIME\nFOR A MAJOR TURN AROUND CONSIDERING WHERE THE POLLS\nARE TODAY? >> WELL, IT'S STILL AUGUST,\nSO THERE IS STILL TIME. I THINK IF YOU ACTUALLY LOOK\nAT WHAT THE CAMPAIGN IS DOING, AS OPPOSED TO WHAT\nSOME OF THE SURROGATES AND SUPPORTERS OUT THERE ARE\nSAYING, THE CAMPAIGN KNOWS AND BELIEVES THAT IT'S\nBEHIND. THIS IS A CAMPAIGN CLEARLY\nTHIS WEEK THAT WAS NOT ACTING LIKE IT'S AHEAD.\nIT HAD A MAJOR SHAKEUP. IT HAD SOME NEW MESSAGING,\nAND KELLYANNE CONWAY WAS ON TV THIS WEEK AND I THINK IT\nHAD EXACTLY THE RIGHT ATTITUDE.\nSHE SAID WE ARE BEHIND IN THE POLLS AND THAT'S A GOOD\nTHING BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO MAKE US WORK HARDER.\nTHAT'S THE ATTITUDE. DON'T PRETEND THE POLLS ARE\nWRONG. GO OUT AND CHANGE THE POLLS.\n>> FORT POLLS HOLD WHERE THEY ARE TODAY, WHAT DOES\nTHIS ELECTION LOOK LIKE? >> IF THE POLLS HOLD WHERE\nTHEY ARE TODAY, THEN IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY ROUGH\nNIGHT FOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.\nAND THAT'S MY CONTENTION. RICH, DON'T GET ME WRONG,\nI'M NOT SAYING THE POLLS ARE WRONG.\nI JUST THINK THAT THEY ARE A LOT CLOSER THAN THEY APPEAR\nTO BE. I MEAN, I THINK YOU HAVE TO\nGO IN AND LOOK AT THE CROSS TABS.\nYOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHERE IT IS -- WHY IS IT THAT\nHILLARY IS STILL LESS THAN 50% IN THE MAJORITY OF THE\nPOLLS? IF SHE IS SPENDING MILLIONS\nAND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, I HAVE SEEN ESTIMATES OVER\n$100 MILLION TO ZERO DOLLARS, AND STILL CAN'T\nBREAK IN TO THE DOUBLE DIGITS AHEAD OF TRUMP, THEN\nTHEY NEED TO BE WORRIED AS WELL.\n>> THE FINDINGS HAVE BEEN PRETTY ROBUST ACROSS ALL\nPOLLING AS CHRIS REFERENCED EARLIER.\nIN THE BATTLE GROUNDS STATES HAVE ACTUALLY SHOWN 8, 9,\nDOUBLE DIGIT POINT LEADS WHICH SUGGEST THAT MAYBE\nTHAT ADVERTISING IS HAVING AN EFFECT.\nSO, AGAIN, I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY PERCENTAGE FOR\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN TO DENY WHAT'S GOING ON.\nTHEY NEED TO GO OUT AND FIGHT BETTER.\nAND IF HE HAS WEEKS LIKE HE HAS HAD THIS WEEK WHERE HE\nHASN'T HAD ANY UNNECESSARY CONTROVERSIES BESIDES THE\nTRUMP SHOOTUP. CAN FIND A BOTTOM AND MAYBE\nBEGIN TO GAIN SOME GROUND. >> FOR A GUY KEEPING TRACK\nTHERE IS JUST NOW OVER 11 WEEKS TO GO UNTIL ELECTION\nDAY.

WHAT DOES HE HAVE TO DO TO\nCLOSE THE GAP? >> WHAT HE HAS TO DO IS\nBUILD A COALITION. HE NEEDS ROSS PEROT'S\nCOALITION.

LET'S TALK ABOUT ALL THIS WITH\nPRINCETON UNIVERSITY HISTORIAN JULIAN ZELEZER, THE AUTHOR OF\nTHE BOOK \"THE FIERCE URGENCY OF NOW.\"\nIS IT FAIR, JULIAN, IS IT ACCURATE, NOT JUST FAIR, TO\nCOMPARE PRESIDENT OBAMA NOT GOING TO LOUISIANA NOW WITH WHAT\nWE JUST SAW WITH FORMER PRESIDENT BUSH AND KATRINA?\nI THINK THE KEY DIFFERENCE IS THE FEDERAL RESPONSE LACKED SO\nMUCH TO KATRINA. THE FEDERAL RESPONSE AND\nSUPPLIES, ET CETERA, TO LOUISIANA RIGHT NOW IS NOT\nWHAT'S BEEN CRITICIZED, IT'S THE OPTICS.\n>> RIGHT. IT'S INEVITABLE THAT THE OPTICS\nGET CRITICIZED. IT OFTEN HAPPENS IN THE SUMMER\nMONTHS, WHEN THE PRESIDENT IS AWAY, IT'S GOING TO BE A\nCRITICISM. THAT SAID, THE HEART OF THE\nKATRINA ISSUE WASN'T THAT PHOTO. THE HEART WAS THE INADEQUATE\nRESPONSE AND THE WAY IN WHICH FEMA HAD BEEN GUTTED IN PREVIOUS\nYEARS BECAUSE OF CUTS AND POOR STAFFING.\nRIGHT NOW THAT'S NOT THE CRITICISM.\nOBAMA AND THE ADMINISTRATION STILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO\nSHOW A FORCEFUL RESPONSIBILITY TO THE CRISIS AND HELP CLEAN\nTHIS UP. >> IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT\nTHE GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA ACTUALLY ASKED THAT THE\nPRESIDENT WAIT TO COME, BECAUSE WHENEVER A PRESIDENT COMES,\nESPECIALLY A SITTING PRESIDENT, A LOT OF RESOURCES GET DIVERTED\nFROM THE CLEANUP. AT THE SAME TIME, THE WHITE\nHOUSE ANNOUNCED THE PRESIDENT WILL BE GOING ON TUESDAY, AFTER\nDONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE LANDED THERE.\n>> RIGHT. IT'S OFTEN THE CASE, AND THIS\nWAS ALSO THE CASE WITH PRESIDENT BUSH, THAT THE WHITE HOUSE FEELS\nTHEIR PRESENCE THERE WILL ONLY CREATE MORE PROBLEMS.\nIT'S A HUGE THING FOR A PRESIDENT TO COME INTO ANY PLACE\nIN THE COUNTRY. BUT TO DO THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF\nA CRISIS MAKES THINGS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT.\nBUT THE TIMING, AGAIN, WHETHER IT'S FAIR OR NOT, BECOMES AN\nISSUE. SO IT LOOKS LIKE THE PRESIDENT\nIS RESPONDING TO THE CRITICS. >> WHAT ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON?\nWHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE OPTICS AND THE ACTION IN TERMS OF SHE\nSPOKE TO THE GOVERNOR, SHE ISSUES THIS STATEMENT ON\nFACEBOOK, CALLS IN EVERYONE TO HELP, GIVE MONEY TO THE RED\nCROSS, DO WHAT YOU CAN. SHE'S NOT PLANNING TO GO, AS FAR\nAS WE KNOW, YET. >> WE'LL SEE IF SHE CHANGES HER\nMIND AND GOES. AGAIN, I THINK WHAT MOST PEOPLE\nARE LOOKING FOR, WHAT ARE THE SOLUTIONS, WHAT ARE THE\nCANDIDATES OFFERING. SOME MIGHT THINK DONALD TRUMP\nBEING THERE AND HANDING THINGS OUT IS GOOD, IT'S MORE\nEFFECTIVE, BUT IN THE END, A LOT OF PEOPLE FROM LOUISIANA WANT\nRELIEF. THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR.\n>> THEY GET SOME RELIEF FROM FUNDING AND MONEY THAT COMES\nWHEN THE TELEVISION CAMERAS ARE THERE, WHICH COMES WHEN A\nPRESIDENT OR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IS THERE.\nDONALD TRUMP CAME AND GAVE OUT SUPPLIES WHICH IS GREAT, BUT HE\nCOULD HAVE SAID NOTHING POLITICAL.\nINSTEAD THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN HE SAID POLITICAL THINGS, LIKE\nYOU JUST HEARD AT THE BEGINNING, \"THE PRESIDENT SHOULD BE HERE.\"\nDID THAT MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A PHOTO OP?\n>> MOST PEOPLE ARE CONVINCED, WHEN THE PRESIDENT, WHEN A\nCANDIDATE GOES, ANYONE POLITICAL GOES INTO A CRISIS AREA LIKE\nTHIS, POLITICS IS ON THEIR MIND. CERTAINLY TRUMP'S COMMENTS\nDIDN'T HELP. AT THE SAME TIME PRESIDENT OBAMA\nIS SAVVY ENOUGH TO REALIZE IMAGES OF HIM GOLFING ON\nMARTHA'S VINEYARD COMBINED WITH THE CRISIS IMAGES DON'T LOOK\nGOOD AND IT DOESN'T HELP HILLARY CLINTON.\nYOU CAN'T EXTRACT THE POLITICS FROM A CRISIS LIKE THIS.\n>> JULIAN ZELIZER, THANK YOU SO MUCH, IMPORTANT PERSPECTIVE, WE\nAPPRECIATE IT.

THAT'S NOT WHAT'S BEING\nCRITICIZED. I SPOKE TO THE HEAD OF FEMA WHO\nWAS DOWN THERE WITH THE PRESIDENT ON WEDNESDAY.\nDOES THAT MATTER IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION?\n>> I THINK IT DOES A LITTLE. BUT THE REALITY IS, IS THAT THE\nWHITE HOUSE HAD NO PLANS TO GO THERE UNTIL TRUMP WAS THERE\nYESTERDAY. >> WE DON'T KNOW THAT.\nTHEY HAVEN'T SAID THAT. >> THEY HAVEN'T SAID THAT,\nTHAT'S TRUE.

IT'S GOING TO TAKE FAITH-BASED\nGROUPS, VOLUNTEERS TO GET PEOPLE BACK INTO THEIR HOMES AND MAKE\nTHEM WHOLE. >> SO GOOD TO HAVE THAT\nINFORMATION, LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, I WANT TO SKIP NOW\nFROM WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER.\nI UNDERSTAND WERE YOU THERE TO GREET DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE\nPENCE THERE YESTERDAY. WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THE IMPACT\nIT HAD? >> I THINK AS YOU SAW PEOPLE\nALONG THE ROUTE AND INTO THE HOMES TO SEE A PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATE COME DOWN HERE. IT LIFTS THEM UP.\nIT MAKES THEM SEEM THAT HE CARES.\nI THINK ANYTIME PUBLIC OFFICIAL AS A GOVERNOR OR MYSELF GOES\nINTO THOSE COMMUNITIES THEY KNOW THEY'RE NOT FORGOTTEN.\nIT'S A GREAT BOOST TO THOSE COMMUNITIES.\nWE APPLAUD ANYBODY TO COME DOWN AND BRING ATTENTION TO THIS\nCATASTROPHE, BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF HELP IN THE WAY\nOF DONATIONS AND VOLUNTEERS TO MAKE LOUISIANA WHOLE.\n>> THE GOVERNOR DID NOT WANT PRESIDENT OBAMA TO GET THERE\nYET. SO THEY COULD LOGISTICALLY DEAL\nWITH SOME OF THE THINGS LIKE SECURITY AND RESOURCES THAT MAY\nCOMPLICATE THE PEOPLE GETTING THE NEED AT THAT POINT IF THE\nPRESIDENT DIDN'T MAKE THAT TRIP. DO YOU THINK THAT PRESIDENT\nOBAMA IS BEING FAIRLY CRITICIZED FOR NOT STEPPING FOOT IN\nLOUISIANA JUST YET? >> YOU KNOW, MY CONCERN IS\nGETTING LOUISIANA BACK WHOLE. I MET WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA WHEN\nI WAS THE PARISH PRESIDENT MANY TIMES DURING THE OIL SPILL.\nAND I'VE HEARD NOW THAT HE IS GOING TO VISIT LOUISIANA.\nI THINK ANY ATTENTION WE CAN GET ON A NATIONAL LEVEL TO HOW BAD\nTHIS FLOODING IS, WILL HELP LOUISIANA RECOVER.\nSO I FIRST INVITE ANYBODY TO COME THAT WANTS TO LEND A HAND\nAND BRING ATTENTION TO THIS HORRIBLE EVENT.\n>> LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, WE SO APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND THE\nCREWS DOWN THERE AND ALL YOU FOLKS THE VERY BEST.\nTHANK YOU. >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP.\nY'ALL HAVE A GREAT DAY.",

LET ME GRAB THE BOX.\n>> THE BUSINESS MAN TO FIGURE OUT THE WAY TO DO IT.\n>> GRABS THE WHOLE BOX HIMSELF. >> HOW HE'S HOPING TO RUN THE\nUNITED STATES IF HE BECOMES PRESIDENT.\n>> HERE'S THE POINT FROM MY POINT OF VIEW.\nHE'S THERE, OBAMA ISN'T. YOU CAN ARGUE WHETHER HIS BEING\nTHERE HELPS THE VICTIMS, THE 85,000 PEOPLE DISPLACED OR\nWHATEVER, BUT THE SYMBOLISM IS IMPORTANT.\nIF THIS WERE HAPPENING IN A SWING STATE, I THINK THE\nPRESIDENT WOULD BE THERE, I THINK HILLARY CLINTON WOULD BE\nTHERE. THEY WOULD NEED TO SHOW EMPATHY.\nI THINK THEY'RE REVEALING WHAT THEY THINK, THEY DON'T CARE\nABOUT LOUISIANA THE PEOPLE OF LOUISIANA WILL NOT VOTE FOR\nTHEM, DIDN'T VOTE FOR OBAMA NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR HILLARY AND\nPRETENDING TO CARE ABOUT THE POPULATION MATTERS.\n>> HE COULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING, COULD HAVE GOTTEN ON SKYPE OR\nSOMETHING AND TO YOUR POINT, LOT OF THESE PEOPLE TENS OF\nTHOUSANDS HAVE BEEN DISPLACED IN DIFFERENT AREAS, BUT AT AID\nSTATIONS, STAYING WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS, HAVE SMARTPHONES\nWOULD HOPEFULLY HEAR THE MESSAGE TAT PRESIDENT CARES, NOT HE'S ON\nTHE GOLF COURSE WITH CELEBRITIES.\n>> I'M SAYING LOGISTICALLY HIM FLYING THERE, THE GOVERNOR HAS\nASKED HIM NOT TO COME, CHRIS CHRISTIE SAID WHEN YOU GET\nPOLITICIANS TO COME, KEEP OUT OF MY STATE.\nWE HAVE STUFF TO DO. WHEN YOU COME INTO MY STATE\nDURING A MAJOR DISASTER IT TIES UP ROADWAYS, SECRET SERVICE.\n>> OBAMA DID GO TO SWING STATE NEW JERSEY DURING SUPERSTORM\nSANDY AND CHRISTIE HUGGED HIM FAY PLUSLY.\nYOU'RE MAKING A POINT WHICH I'M NOT CRITICIZING, YOU'RE RIGHT ON\nTHE MERIT, BUT WHEN YOU ARE A LEADER YOU DEMONSTRATE YOU LOVE\nTHE PEOPLE YOU LEAD. THE POINT IS THAT HILLARY AND\nOBAMA DON'T LOVE A LOT OF PEOPLE THEY LEAD.\nDISMISS THEM AS BIG GOT AND RELIGIOUS CRAZY AND GUN OWNERS.\n>> IT'S A DOUBLE STANDARD BECAUSE PRESIDENT OBAMA\nCRITICIZED -- NOT PRESIDENT THEN BUT DURING KATRINA WAS ONE OF\nTHOSE AMONG A LONG LINE THAT WAS BEATING THE DRUM AGAINST\nPRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH FOR DOING THE FLYOVER AFTER KATRINA, AND\nHILLARY CLINTON DID THE VERY SAME THING.\nTHE FACT THAT WE HAVE TAPE. WATCH.\n>> IF YOU'RE STUCK ON A ROOFTOP OR STRANDED AT THE SUPERDOME\nDURING A HURRICANE, YOU'RE INVISIBLE TO THIS PRESIDENT EVEN\nWHEN YOU'RE ON CNN. >> THAT WAS A HUGE MISTAKE.\nTHE PRESIDENT FLYING OVER. IT APPEARED HE WAS DISCONNECTED,\nJUST LOOG DOWN AT LOUISIANA OUT THE AIRPLANE WINDOW.\nAND, OF COURSE, PREVIOUS IN EARLIER IN THE WEEK HE WAS AT\nTHAT FUND-RAISER WITH I THINK GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER OUT IN\nCALIFORNIA. HE WAS ON STAGE PLAYING GUITAR\nWITH HIM AT THAT TIME. >> SO IN THE END, OF COURSE, THE\nBUSH ADMINISTRATION CAME UNDER SO MUCH PRESSURE OVERREACTED\nSENT BILLIONS TO LOUISIANA A LOT OF WHICH WAS STOLEN AND MISUSED\nAND DIDN'T SOLVE THE CITY'S CORE PROBLEMS AND SO I KIND OF AGREE\nWITH YOUR POINT THERE ARE -- YOU KNOW THE RATIONALE POINT, WHICH\nIS THAT LEADERS OUGHT TO HELP THE COMMUNITIES THEY GRANDSTAND\nIN FRONT OF BUT IT IS TELLING THAT OBAMA IS NOT THERE.\n>> THE OPTICS MATTER.

MAYBE A RHETORICAL QUESTION.\nWILL HILLARY CLINTON HAVE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT HER\nPERSONAL E-MAIL SERVER UNDER OATH.\nTHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NOW. CHRIS FARRELL WAS ON THE SHOW\nEARLIER TODAY AND HE'S THE DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH AND\nINVESTIGATION FOR JUDICIAL WATCH WHO PUSHED FOR THIS AND HE SAYS,\nSHE'S FINALLY GOING TO HAVE TO ANSWER FOR THIS.\nLISTEN. >> IT'S GOING TO BE SPECIFICALLY\nCONCERNING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF HER SERVER.\nREALLY WE'RE GOING TO FILL IN SOME OF THE BLANKS OF THE\nVARIOUS NATIONAL SECURITY CRIMES THAT SHE ENGAGED IN THAT\nDIRECTOR COMEY DETAILED AT LENGTH AND THEN PUNTED ON.\nSO THERE'S REAL -- THE BASIC INTERROGATORY GATIVE, WHY DID\nSHE DO IT, HOW DID SHE SET IT UP, WHO DID SHE ORDER AND HOW\nDID THEY GO ABOUT DOING THAT. IT'S ALL THE UNANSWERED\nQUESTIONS, FRANKLY, THAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IS REALLY DUE AT\nTHIS POINT. THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT WE\nWILL NOW HAVE HER ON THE RECORD UNDER OATH, SOMETHING NO ONE\nELSE HAS EVER DONE, AND IT WAS ORDERED BY A COURT, ORDERED BY A\nJUDGE, WHO'S ACTUALLY PUT IN BY HER HUSBAND.\n>> IF YOU GOT CALLED BEFORE THE FBI, WHICH IS NOT GOING TO\nHAPPEN BECAUSE YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON, IF YOU OR I DID, WE\nWOULD BE INDIVIDUAL TAPED,  FELONY GO TO JAIL LIKE MARTHA\nSTEWART DID.

WAIT A MINUTE, THAT HAS\nALWAYS BEEN TO THE REGION. WHAT THE NEWS TELLS US FROM\nTHE BUSH CASE IS THAT THE FEMA DIRECTOR WAS AN UTTER\nFAILURE DURING KATRINA WHICH IS COMPLETE DIFFERENCE THAN\nTHIS FEMA DIRECTOR. NUMBER THREE AND MOST\nIMPORTANTLY AND I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT\nFOLKS DON'T UNDERSTAND IS EVEN THOUGH DONALD TRUMP\nWENT THERE, BECAUSE HIS PLANE WAS THERE, WHAT SAFETY\nPLANE COULDN'T LAND? WHAT PLANE OF RESOURCES\nCOULDN'T LAND? WHAT POLICE OFFICERS WERE\nTAKEN OFF THE STREET HELPING THE SURVIVORS?\nTHAT'S THE QUESTION. >> WE KNOW THERE ARE 13\nDEATHS RELATED. >> NOT AT ALL, MARK, NOT AT\nALL. >> HOLD ON.\nHOLD ON. WE HAVE HAD OUR FINAL\nPOLITICAL THOUGHTS THERE IT'S ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATION\nDOWN THERE.
