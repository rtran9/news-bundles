I DIDN'T SAY THAT.\nTHAT'S ACCORDING TO A NEW REPORT FROM THE WASHINGTON POST.\nTHAT SAYS QUOTE WHILE CAREFUL NOT TO SOUND LIKE SHE IS\nMEASURING THE DRAPERIES QUITE YET, CLINTON NOW DESCRIBES WHAT\nSHE CALLS IMPORTANT ADDS FOR PASSAGE OF AN OVERALL OF\nIMMIGRATION LAWS THE FIRST LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY SHE\nOUTLINED IN DETAIL LAST LAST YEAR AND WHAT WOULD BE A\nBIPARTISAN EFFORT TO REBUILD THE NATION'S ROADS, BRIDGE WEBS\nAIRPORTS AND RAIL SYSTEM AND PORTS.\nFIRST, YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO SORT OF, I THINK AS A CANDIDATE, PLAN\nFOR THE FUTURE, BUT NOT LOOK LIKE YOU'RE PLANNING TOO FAR\nINTO THE FUTURE. SO THE OPTICS HERE COULD BE\nRATHER BAD. THINKING THAT MAYBE HILLARY IS\nTOO CONFIDENT SHE IS GOING TO WIN.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK? >> YEAH, AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR.\nI DON'T THINK THAT THE CAMPAIGN IS TRYING TO GET AHEAD OF\nTHEMSELVES. I THINK THEY ARE TRYING TO\nOUTLINE THE AGENDA IN DETAIL TO PROVIDE WHAT A CLINTON WHITE\nHOUSE WOULD LOOK LIKE. SO VOTERS REALLY WANT THAT\nVISION. LIKE WHAT IS A WHITE HOUSE WITH\nA CLINTON IN IT WITH A DIFFERENT CLINTON IN IT GOING TO LOOK LIKE\nAND HOW WILL THAT DIFFER AND WHAT WILL BE HER PRIORITIES.\nI THINK WITH SO MUCH OF THIS ELECTION GOING BY AND WE ARE SO\nCLOSE AND WE'RE NOT HEARING A LOT ABOUT ISSUES SHE WANTED TO\nPUT THE DETAILS IN THERE AND LAY OUT THE SPECIFICS IF YOU WILL OF\nTHAT BLUEPRINT. >> KRISTIN, THIS COULD BE AN\nADVANTAGE FOR DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE IT COULD GET SOME PEOPLE\nSO FIRED UP ANGRY THAT HILLARY IS EXPECTING TO WIN SO EASILY\nTHAT THEY WILL TURN OUT AND VOTE AGAINST HER.\nBUT I HAVE OTHER ISSUES WITH DONALD TRUMP.\nIF HE DOESN'T PLAN BEYOND WINNING WOULDN'T HE BE\nCRITICIZED FOR THAT TOO? >> HERE IS THE BOTTOM LINE,\nHILLARY CLINTON IS TAKING IT FOR GRANTED THAT SHE WILL WIN WAY\nTOO EARLY. BY ASSUMING SHE WILL WIN SHE IS\nALSO ASSUMING THAT DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO IT NOT TO RUN A VERY\nWEAK CAMPAIGN. AND TO BE FAIR, HE HAS RUN A\nRELATIVELY WEAK CAMPAIGN UP UNTIL A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO.\nON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY, WE SAW A MUCH DIFFERENT TRUMP.\nWE SAW TRUMP STRONG, YET HUMBLE. A TRUMP THAT WILL ADMIT TO HIS\nMISTAKES. AND IF HE KEEPS ON THAT PATH,\nHILLARY SHOULD NOT ASSUME SHE IS GOING TO WIN.\nTRUMP COULD APPEAL TO A LOT OF VOTERS IF HE KEEPS ON THIS PATH\nOF STRENGTH, YET BEING HUMBLE AND TALKING ABOUT US, THE\nVOTERS, INSTEAD OF FOCUSSING ON HIMSELF AND PERSONALLY ATTACKING\nHIS CRITICS. >> A NEW TRUMP AND WE COULD LOOK\nFOR THAT. TARYN, ALSO A STAFFER IS SAYING\nIF HILLARY CLINTON WINS, IT WILL BE AN UPHILL BATTLE.\nHERE IS THE QUOTE. I DON'T THINK ANY PRESIDENT HAS\nCOME TO OFFICE UNDER WATER ON THEIR FAVORABLE IMAGE.\nOR AS UNDER WATER. THIS WOULD BE UNCHARTED WATERS\nCOMING TO AN OFFICE AS AN UNPOPULAR PERSON.\nYOU DON'T HAVE A GOODWILL TO DRAW ON EVEN IN THE FIRST 100\nDAYS. HOW WILL THAT AFFECT HER INITIAL\nPRODUCTIVITY, AGAIN, IF SHE WINS.\n>> RIGHT. ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS SHE\nWOULD HAVE TO DO IS DWANE AND WORK FOR REPUBLICAN SUPPORT FOR\nCONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE SHE GETS THAT\nDONE. THAT BEING SAID, I THINK THERE\nIS A LOT OF ROOM FOR HER TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT.\nBECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A LETTER THAT CAME FROM CONGRESSIONAL\nREPUBLICANS, OVER A HUNDRED OF THEM, JUST THE OTHER DAY I'VE\nSEEN THE RNC TO PULL SUPPORT FROM TRUMP.\nI THINK THERE IS FOR HIS DIVISIVENESS AND RECKLESSNESS.\nI THAT I THERE IS DEFINITELY SOME MOVEMENT HERE THAT IF THE\nSCENARIO IS THAT SHE WINS, AND IF SHE WINS, THAT THERE WOULD BE\nSOME MOVEMENT TOWARDS HER AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE BECAUSE I\nTHINK IT IS WINNING WE ALL KNOW IS CLEAR AS THE COUNTRY IS\nCLAMORING FOR IMMIGRATION REFORM.\nTHAT'S WHY WE HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONES.\nAND SPECIFICALLY THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE BIPARTISAN.\nSO WE WOULD HAVE TO REACH ACROSS.\n>> OKAY. I WILL BRING UP SOMETHING ELSE.\nAMIDST THE CHANGES WE HAVE SEEN IN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION ANNOUNCED IT IS NOT GOING TO ACCEPT FOREIGN\nDONATION FESS CLINTON WINS. CAMPAIGN MANAGER TALKED ABOUT\nTHIS WITH DANA BASH A SHORT WHILE AGO.\nLISTEN. >> BUT IF THIS IS THE RIGHT\nPOLICY NOW, WHY NOT DO IT NOW? WHY WAIT UNTIL THE IDEA OF HER\nBEING PRESIDENT? WHY NOT DO IT WHILE SHE IS\nRUNNING FOR PRESIDENT? >> THE FOUNDATION IS DOING AN\nENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WORK AND IT TAKES TIME WHEN YOU'RE IN A\nNUMBER OF COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD TO RETOOL, REFOCUS THE\nMISSION, AND ADAPT. AS YOU SAID, THEY RECEIVE A\nGREAT DEAL OF FUNDING THROUGH THESE STREAMS AND IT'LL JUST\nTAKE SOME TIME FOR THEM TO READJUST.\n>> KRISTIN, IS IT OKAY FOR THE FOUNDATION TO CONTINUE TO\nRECEIVE FOREIGN MONEY UP UNTIL NOVEMBER?\n>> ABSOLUTELY NOT. LOOK, THE DAMAGE HAS ALREADY\nBEEN DONE. CLINTON FOUNDATION ACCEPTED TENS\nOF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM FOREIGN ENTITIES.\nIF SHOULD HAVE BEEN SHUT DOWN A LONG TIME AGO.\nBUT THIS JUST SPEAKS TO HOW WEAK A CANDIDATE HILLARY CLINTON IS.\nSHE IS SUCH A BEATABLE CANDIDATE.\nAND THIS IS WHY IT IS SO CRITICAL FOR TRUMP TO STAY ON\nTRACK, FOCUS ON THE ISSUES, AND HE CAN BEAT HER.\nAND MARTIN WE ALSO HAVE TO POINT OUT HERE THAT A LOT OF AMERICANS\nHAVE NOT REALLY TUNED IN CLOSELY TO THIS RACE YET.\nA LOT OF THIS WILL COME DOWN TO THE FIRST DEBATE.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE WILL START PAYING ATTENTION AFTER THE FIRST\nDEBATE AND DURING THE FIRST DEBATE.\nIF TRUMP CAN DO A GOOD JOB THERE HILLARY HAS GOT TO BE CAREFUL.\nSHE SHOULD NOT TAKE FOR GRANTED SHE HAS THIS IN THE BAG.\n>> AND THAT'S WHERE THIS WHOLE CONVERSATION BEGAN.\nTHANK YOU.",

THIS IS IT.\n>> IS IT IN THE SENSE THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS PROVEN\nFRUSTRATING TO HILLARY CLINTON IS BECAUSE PEOPLE THINK THEY\nKNOW HER BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN AROUND FOR SO LONG.\nIT'S HARD FOR PEOPLE TO CHANGE OPINIONS ABOUT HER.\nDONALD TRUMP, PEOPLE KNOW HIM AS A CELEBRITY AND A REAL ESTATE\nGUY BUT HE DID CHANGE OPINIONS ABOUT HIM BECAUSE HE'S NEW ON\nTHE POLITICAL STAGE. IS THERE A FEAR IN THE CAMPAIGN?\nTHEY MAY THINK IT'S CYNICAL AND BOGUS, BUT DO THEY THINK IT\nMIGHT WORK? >> THEY WORRY IT MIGHT HAVE THE\nEFFECT OF CONSOLIDATING REPUBLICANS.\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT THE POLLING IN RECENT WEEKS, IT'S SHOWN THAT\nDONALD TRUMP HAS NOT DONE WHAT VIRTUALLY EVERY OTHER REPUBLICAN\nNOMINEE HAS DONE, WHICH IS CONSOLIDATE HIS BASE.\nGET UP WHERE SHE IS AMONG DEMOCRATS, IN THE 80s AND CLOSE\nTO THE 90s AMONG REPUBLICANS. THERE ARE MANY REPUBLICANS\nINCLUDING PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON WHO WANT TO SAY WE WANT TO KNOW\nIF DONALD TRUMP WILL BE RELIABLE TO DO WHAT WE WANT HIM TO DO.\nTHAT'S WHAT HE DEMONSTRATED LAST WEEK.\nI DON'T THINK THE CLINTON FOLKS ARE WORRIED ABOUT SWING VOTERS.\nTO JONATHAN'S POINT, THE SUBURBAN WOMEN, THEY'VE BEEN\nBOMBARDED WITH ADS FROM THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN LOCKING IN\nDONALD TRUMP'S PERSONA FOR MANY, MANY MONTHS NOW.\nIT WILL BE VERY HARD TO UNDO THAT WITH ONE SPEECH.\nI THINK REPUBLICANS WHO ARE LOOKING FOR A REASON TO TRUST\nTRUMP, THIS MIGHT BE THAT REASON THAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR.\n>> A LOT OF THE POLLS SHOW THAT SOME OF THE REPUBLICANS ARE\nCONCERNED ABOUT HIM BEING INTOLERANT.\nONE IN FIVE REPUBLICAN MEN SEE HIM AS INTOLERANT.\n25% OF REPUBLICAN WOMEN. SO WHEN HE GOES AND HE IS IN\nFRONT OF THE WHITE AUDIENCES, HE ACTUALLY IS APPEALING TO THOSE\nWHITE AUDIENCES WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT AFRICAN-AMERICANS.\nHE ISN'T REALLY, I DON'T THINK AT LEAST, APPEALING TO\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS. HE IS TRYING TO APPEAL TO THE\nAUDIENCES HE IS IN FRONT OF. >> YOU MENTIONED THE SOFTER\nTOUCH OF KELLYANNE CONWAY. SHE HAS NEVER RUN A CAMPAIGN.\nA LOT OF REPUBLICANS ARE NERVOUS ABOUT HER RUNNING A CAMPAIGN AT\nTHIS LEVEL. SHE HAS A HISTORY OF MESSAGING\nTO GET TO MORE MODERATE VOTERS. WE SAW DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE\nPENCE GO TO BATON ROUGE. IT'S A PHOTO OP.\nA LOT OF THEM DO. I AM NOT CRITICIZING HIM.\nHE WENT AND SHOWED SOME COMPASSION.\nHELPING UNLOAD AN AID TRUCK. ON A COUPLE OCCASIONS HE SAID HE\nTHOUGHT BARACK OBAMA SHOULD HAVE BROKEN HIS VACATION AND GONE\nTHERE OR AT LEAST COME BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE TO MONITOR THIS.\nIS THIS A SMART, REACTIVE POLITICS, NEITHER HERE NOR\nTHERE? >> I THINK IT'S A RARE MOMENT\nWHERE HE SAW A MOMENT THAT MADE HIM LOOK A BIT MORE\nCOMPASSIONATE AND WENT FOR THAT LANE.\nTHERE IS A LANE OPEN BECAUSE OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION UP\nUNTIL SEVERAL DAYS AGO NOT HAVING RELEASED A STATEMENT,\nTHOUGH THEY'VE DONE RESOURCE UPDATES.\nI THINK IT WAS NOT A BAD MOVE. THE QUESTION IS CAN HE FIND THE\nLANES FOR THE REST OF THE CAMPAIGN.\nYOU'RE RIGHT WHEN HE IS PROBABLY TRYING TO GO AFTER DISAFFECTED\nREPUBLICANS. HAD HE DONE IT SIX MONTHS AGO,\nIT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE LIKELY.\nAT THIS POINT IT'S TOUGHER. >> GREAT POINT.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WATCHED THE STATUS QUO SPEECH WERE LIKE, WHY\nDIDN'T YOU DO THIS BEFORE? T\nTHE CAMPAIGN SHAKEUP. I DON'T THINK VOTERS TEND TO\nVOTE FOR WHO IS ON THE LETTERHEAD.\nBUT THIS WAS INTERESTING. PAUL MANAFORT GETS SHOVED ASIDE\nAND THEN RESIGNS. KELLYANNE CONWAY GETS PROMOTED.\nSHE WAS THE SENIOR ADVISER AND IS NOW THE CAMPAIGN MANAGER.\nSTEVE BANNON FROM BRIGHT BART. AND ROGER AILES IS SHOWING UP AT\nCERTAIN MEETINGS. HE HELPED GEORGE H.W. BUSH MEET\nMICHAEL DUKAKIS. HE IS A GUY WHO JUST HAD TO QUIT\nHIS JOB BECAUSE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS.\nI CAN'T ASSUME THE HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN WON'T USE THAT\nIN AN ADD PRETTY SOON. INSIDE THE SHAKEUP IT'S MADE\nESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS NERVOUS.\nSTEVE BANNON HAS TREATED THEM AS A PINATA.\nIF YOU ARE A REPUBLICAN LEADER THE MAN HAS ESSENTIALLY CALLED\nYOU WORSE THAN THE DEMOCRATS. >> IT'S A JEKYLL AND HYDE\nSHAKEUP. THERE ARE TWO OPPOSITE SIDES\nHERE. THE CONCERN WITH BANNON IS THAT\nHE IS ONLY SKILLED -- AND A LITTLE BIT AILES -- THEY'RE ONLY\nSKILLED IN REACHING THE PEOPLE YOU'RE ALREADY REACHING.\nIS THAT THE GOAL?

THIS WEEKEND WE'VE SEEN DONALD\nTRUMP HAS BEEN IN NORTH CAROLINA.\nHE'S BEEN IN FREDERICKSBURG, VIRGINIA.\nHILLARY CLINTON I THINK HAS BEEN ON MARTHA'S VINEYARD, NOT GOING\nOUT AND SEEING THE PEOPLE, BUT FUND-RAISING.\nTHERE IS A DIFFERENT STYLE AND DIFFERENT APPROACH.\n>> WE'LL GET TO THAT DIFFERENT STYLE IN A MOMENT.\nLET ME COME TO YOU. AS THE CONGRESSMAN BROUGHT UP\nTHIS POINT, MUCH DEEPER PAYROLL, MUCH LARGER ORGANIZATION, HER\nBURN RATE HIGHER THAN DONALD TRUMP'S.\nIS SHE SPENDING TOO MUCH MONEY? >> DONALD TRUMP CAN'T MAKE UP\nTHIS GROUND, BECAUSE HE HAS NO GROUND GAME.\nSHE DOES. SHE HAS THE MOST AMAZING TEAM.\nSHE HAS THE MOST AMAZING VOLUNTEERS THAT ARE OUT THERE\nKNOCKING DOORS. A LOT OF THEM ARE EDUCATORS.\nI REPRESENT 3 MILLION EDUCATORS THAT WORK IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS,\nCOLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. WE KNOW WHAT'S AT STAKE HERE.\nAND THE WHOLE INTERESTING PHENOMENON ABOUT RALLIES, THE\nKIND OF MEDIA ATTENTION THAT DONALD TRUMP IS GETTING FROM THE\nTHINGS HE'S SAYING AT RALLIES IS NOT RESONATING WITH THE PUBLIC.\nYOU CAN TAKE A LOOK AT ANY POLLS, IN FACT ALL OF THEM.\nAND WHAT GETS APPLAUSE LINES AT A RALLY IS THE LAUGH LINE WITH\nTHE REST OF THE PUBLIC. THEY'RE NOT BUYING WHAT HE SAYS.\n>> THE SUGGEST IS THE FREE MEDIA HERE IS NOT HELPING DONALD\nTRUMP. >> ABSOLUTELY NOT.\nI THINK WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THE POLLS AND SEE THIS.\n>> LET ME PLAY THIS AD THAT CAME OUT FROM THE RNC ABOUT HILLARY\nCLINTON.

WE BELIEVE IN THINGS LIKE PUBLIC\nEDUCATION AND PUBLIC SERVICES. THAT'S WHY WE'VE GOT PEOPLE ALL\nOVER THE COUNTRY WILLING TO WALK NEIGHBORHOODS AND DO WHATEVER IT\nTAKES TO MAKE SURE SHE GETS ELECTED.\nI THINK THEY HAVE TO SHIFT THE DISCUSSION.\nTHEY HAVE TO GET PEOPLE TO, LIKE ON THAT AD, STOP ACTUALLY ASKING\nABOUT ISSUES. BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE\nISSUES, SHE'S GOT PLANS AND HE'S GOT SLOGANS.\nHE'S GOT NOTHING. >> THE ARGUMENT IS THAT WHERE\nHILLARY CLINTON IS GOING TO GET HER MONEY IS FROM THE ELITES ON\nTHE EAST COAST AND THE WEST COAST.\n>> AND EVERYONE IN BETWEEN.

CONWAY ALSO SAID TRUMP JUST HAD\nTHE BEST WEEK OF HIS ENTIRE CAMPAIGN BECAUSE IN HER WORDS,\nHE IS FINALLY ABLE TO BE HIMSELF.\nPERHAPS A DIG AT FORMER CAMPAIGN CHAIR PAUL MANAFORT WHO RESIGNED\nEARLIER ABOUT HIS ALLEGED TIES TO RUSSIA.\nIT'S SOMETHING ROBBIE MOOK SEEDS UPON TODAY.\n>> WE NEED DONALD TRUMP TO EXPLAIN TO US THE EXTENT THE\nHAND OF THE KREMLIN IS AT THE CORE OF HIS OWN CAMPAIGN THERE\nIS A WEB OF FINANCIAL INTERESTS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN DISCLOSED,\nAND THERE ARE REAL QUESTIONS BEING RAISED ABOUT WHETHER\nDONALD TRUMP HIMSELF IS JUST A PUPPET FOR THE KREMLIN IN THIS\nRACE. >> SO WHILE THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN\nIS FOCUSED ON TRUMP AND RUSSIA, THE TRUMP CAM PLAIN IS GOING\nAFTER THE CLINTON FOUNDATION FOR WHAT IT CALLS A BLATANT CONFLICT\nOF INTEREST, A FOUNDATION THAT WAS ACCEPTING FOREIGN DONATIONS\nWHILE HILLARY CLINTON WAS STILL SECRETARY OF STATE.\nTODAY FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR AND TRUMP SUPPORTER RUDY\nGIULIANI WENT SO FAR AS TO SAY THIS.\nLISTEN. >> IF I WERE BACK IN MY OLD JOB\nAS U.S. ATTORNEY, I WOULD PROBABLY INDICT THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION AS A RACKETEERING ENTERPRISE.\nSHE DID FAVORS FOR THOSE VERY PEOPLE WHO GAVE MONEY TO THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION. >> SOME STRONG WORDS.\nSO CLINTON SPENT THE WEEKEND FUNDRAISING ON CAPE COD AND\nMARTHA'S VINEYARD, AND SHE WILL CONTINUE THAT EFFORT TOMORROW IN\nLOS ANGELES. WHILE TRUMP, HE IS OFF TO OHIO.\nHE'S GOT A BIG RALLY PLANNED TOMORROW NIGHT AT THE UNIVERSITY\nOF AKRON. ERIC?\n>> ALL RIGHT. EVERYBODY IS BACK TO WORK ON\nMONDAY.",

ANOTHER BIG SHAKEUP IN THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN THIS WEEK PROMOTING VETERAN GOP POLLSTER KELLYANNE\nCONWAY TO CAMPAIGN MANAGER. AND BANNON TO CEO.\n>> I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS SHOWN US WHO HE\nIS. HE CAN HIRE AND FIRE ANYBODY HE\nWANTS FROM HIS CAMPAIGN. THEY CAN MAKE HIM READ NEW WORDS\nFROM A TELEPROMPTER. BUT IS STILL THE SAME MAN WHO\nINSULTS GOLD STAR FAMILIES, DEMEANS WOMEN, MOCKS PEOPLE WITH\nDISABILITIES, AND THINKS HE KNOWS MORE ABOUT ISIS THAN OUR\nGENERALS. >> JOINING THE PANEL THIS WEEK,\n\"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" COLUMNIST AND DEPUTY EDITOR DAN HENNINGER\nAND JAMES FREEMAN. KIM, LET'S TAKE THESE PERSONNEL\nCHANGES FIRST. DO THESE CHOICES, CAN THEY MAKE\nA DIFFERENCE IN THE CAMPAIGN? >> THEY SEEM TO HAVE MADE SOME\nDIFFERENCE SO FAR. WHAT WE'VE SEEN THIS WEEK IS A\nDONALD TRUMP WHO HAS BEEN READING FROM SCRIPT IN A MORE\nDISCIPLINED MANNER. WE SAW DONALD TRUMP IN\nCHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA, WHO ACTUALLY EXPRESSED REGRET FOR\nSOME OF THE COMMENTS HE'D MADE AND TALKING ABOUT HOW THIS\nNEEDED TO BE A CAMPAIGN THAT PULLED PEOPLE TOGETHER.\nWE KNOW HE'S GOING TO BE GIVING A SERIES OF POLICY SPEECHES OVER\nTHE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS THAT TOUCH ON IMMIGRATION AND EDUCATION\nREFORM. SO THIS IS A DIFFERENT DONALD\nTRUMP. YOU SEE THE INFLUENCE OF\nKELLYANNE CONWAY. THE QUESTION IS, CAN HE STAY ON\nTRACK. >> I WANT TO DISTINGUISH HERE\nBETWEEN BANNON AND CONWAY. WHAT SKILLS, EXPERIENCE DOES SHE\nBRING TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN? >> LOOK, SHE IS MORE OF A\nVETERAN PERSON IN POLITICS. SHE'S WORKED ON A LOT OF\nCAMPAIGNS, INTERESTINGLY WITH KIND OF ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT\nCHARACTERS IN THE PAST. SO SHE'S COMFORTABLE IN THAT\nREALM. SHE'S VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT\nTHE WOMEN'S VOTE. SHE'S MADE A KIND OF STUDY AND\nART OF IT. HER GOAL IS TO MAYBE MAKE DONALD\nTRUMP NOT JUST MORE RIGOROUS AND DISCIPLINED, BUT HUMANIZE HIS\nCAMPAIGN A LITTLE BIT AND MAKE IT MORE OPTIMISTIC.\nSHE SAID AS MUCH. >> THAT'S NOT STEVE BANNON'S\nFORTE. >> HIS IS TO APPEAL TO UNIONIZED\nDEMOCRATS, THE FORGOTTEN PEOPLE AS TRUMP DESCRIBES THEM.\nTRUMP HAS FINALLY FIGURED OUT HE'S NOT GOING TO WIN MERELY\nWITH THE BASE THAT PROVIDED HIM IN THE VICTORY IN THE PRIMARIES.\nTHE OPINION POLLS SHOW YOU LOSE IF THAT'S ALL YOU GET IN THE\nGENERAL ELECTION. NOW, I READ THAT SPEECH WHERE HE\nTALKS ABOUT THE SYSTEM BEING RIGGED, THAT'S BERNIE SANDERS.\nWHEN HE ATTACKED WASHINGTON INSIDERS --\n>> BUT THOSE ARE OLD MESSAGES. >> I'M TALKING ABOUT THE BASE\nHE'S TRYING TO ASSEMBLE. CLEARLY TRUMP HAS FIGURED OUT.\n>> WHAT ABOUT THE -- >> THIS IS DESPERATION ON THE\nPART OF DONALD TRUMP, SHAKING UP HIS CAMPAIGN THIS CLOSE TO LABOR\nDAY. THINGS ARE -- HE'S IN TROUBLE\nAND HE KNOWS IT. I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING OF A\nHAIL MARY. BANNON TO ME SIGNALS THAT TRUMP\nWANTS TO BE TRUMP. BANNON RUNS BREITBART, A WEBSITE\nTHAT IF ANYTHING THINKS TRUMP HAS BEEN TOO MILD MANNERED UP\nUNTIL NOW. SO THIS IS SOMEONE I THINK WHO\nWANTS TRUMP TO CONTINUE RUNNING THE CAMPAIGN HE RAN IN THE\nPRIMARIES. AND THAT'S WHAT HE'S SURROUNDED\nHIMSELF WITH. I THINK KELLYANNE CONWAY WE ALL\nKNOW HER, WE'VE KNOWN HER A LONG TIME.\nBUT SHE'S NOT A CAMPAIGN MANAGER.\nSHE'S -- THIS IS GOING TO BE NEW FOR HER.\nSHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO ADJUST TO THIS.\n>> WE'LL SEE. >> I THINK THAT'S HER TITLE.\nI DON'T THINK SHE'S GOING TO MANAGE THE CAMPAIGN.\nI THINK SHE'S GOING TO TRY TO IMPROVE AND REFINE THE MESSAGE.\n>> RIGHT. BUT CAMPAIGNS ARE ABOUT THE\nCANDIDATE. AND THEN THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH\nADVICE TRUMP SEEMS WILLING TO TAKE.\n>> THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.\nBUT HERE'S WHAT I -- WHAT'S SURPRISING TO ME.\nTRUMP SAID WHEN HE MADE THE  I'M THE SAME PERSON.\nTHEN HE GIVES THAT SPEECH, WHICH IS A DIFFERENT PERSON.\nAT LEAST IT'S DIFFERENT RHETORIC.\nIF HE HAD GIVEN THAT SPEECH AT THE CONVENTION THEN THAT HAD\nBEEN THE SPEECH FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS, I THINK THIS\nCAMPAIGN COULD BE IN A DIFFERENT PLACE.\n>> IT WAS A SPEECH TO ALL THE PEOPLE, TO THE FORGOTTEN PEOPLE\nWHO AREN'T WASHINGTON INSIDERS, BUT TO ALL AMERICANS.\nI THINK THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THERE FOR ALL AMERICANS TO\nAPPRECIATE. I THINK THIS HAS BEEN A GOOD FEW\nDAYS. I THINK TRUMP HAS BENEFITED FROM\nCREATING A STRUCTURE NOW. YOU DON'T WANT TOO MUCH\nMANAGEMENT IN CAMPAIGNS. BUT HE NEEDED A STAFF BEYOND HIS\nOWN INSTINCTS GOING OUT ON TWITTER.\nIF YOU THINK OF KELLYANNE CONWAY AS COMPETENTLY ALLOWING HIM TO\nSPEAK TO A BROADER AUDIENCE, MAYBE BANNON'S ROLE TO PRECISELY\nTARGET THE CASE AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON, THIS COULD BE A BIG\nWIN. >> HE'S ALSO ROLLING OUT ADS IN\nTHE CAMPAIGN.  >> IN HILLARY CLINTON'S AMERICA,\nTHE SYSTEM STAYS RIGGED AGAINST AMERICANS.\nILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS CONVICTED OF COMMITTING CRIMES GET TO STAY,\nSKIPPING THE LINE. OUR BORDER OPEN, IT'S MORE OF\nTHE SAME, BUT WORSE. DONALD TRUMP'S AMERICA IS\nSECURE. THE BORDER SECURE, OUR FAMILIES\nSAFE. CHANGE THAT MAKES AMERICA SAFE\nAGAIN. DONALD TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT.\n>> KIM, FIRST OF ALL, JUST RUNNING ADS IS A STEP FORWARD\nFOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. BUT WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT\nMESSAGE? THAT'S NOT THE MESSAGE OF\nCHARLOTTE. THAT'S THE TRUMP OF ANTI-TERROR\nAND THE PRIMAPRIMARIES. >> IT'S THE TRUMP TOO TRYING TO\nPLAY OFF GRIEVANCES OUT THERE, A GENERAL SENSE OF MALAISE AMONG\nVOTERS THAT THEY'RE NOT MOVING FORWARD.\nTHERE'S AN ELEMENT OF OPTIMISM TO THE AD TO IN THAT IT IS\nPRESENTING A FUTURE IN WHICH THEY'RE SAYING THE WORLD WILL BE\nBETTER UNDER TRUMP. IT'S NOT VERY SPECIFIC ON HOW\nTHAT WOULD HAPPEN. THIS IS MORE THE DONALD TRUMP OF\nTHE PRIMARY. >> ANYBODY ELSE HAVE A TAKE ON\nTHIS? JAMES?\n>> WELL, LOOK, THIS IS A WINNING ISSUE FOR HIM AS FAR AS LIMITING\nIMMIGRATION FROM PARTS OF THE WORLD WITH A HISTORY OF\nTERRORISM. HE SAID IN NORTH CAROLINA,\nDOVETAILS WITH THAT AD, WE'RE NOT GOING TO LED IN PEOPLE WHO\nTHINK SHARIA LAW SUPPLANTS THE U.S. CONSTITUTION.\nI DON'T KNOW ANYONE WHO COULD DISAGREE WITH THAT STATEMENT.\nYOU LOOK AT POLLS, THIS IS A WINNING MESSAGE.\n>> ALL RIGHT.",

            "text": "SUNDAY.\n>>> HELLO AGAIN FROM FOX NEWS IN WASHINGTON.\nIT HAS BEEN A DRAMATIC WEEK FOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, ONE THAT\nINCLUDED A COMPLETE MANAGEMENT OVERHAUL.\nPAUL MANAFORT RESIGNED OVER CONTROVERSY OVER CONSULTING WORK\nIN UKRAINE. EARLIER IN THE WEEK TRUMP NAMED\nTHE CHAIRMAN OF THE BREITBART NEWS WEBSITE STEVE BANNON AS HIS\nCHIEF CAMPAIGN EXECUTIVE AND KELLYANNE CONWAY AS HIS CAMPAIGN\nMANAGER. THIS COMES AS TRUMP ATTEMPTS TO\nBROADEN HIS APPEAL, EXPRESSING REGRET OVER COMMENTS HE'S MADE.\nJOINING ME NOW IS FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR RUDY GIULIANI.\nWELCOME BACK TO FOX NEWS SUNDAY. >> GREAT PLEASURE TO BE HERE.\n>> THE WEEK YOU'VE HAD, IT'S BEEN MIXED.\nTHERE'S BEEN TALK OF THE CAMPAIGN SHAKE-UP.\nBUT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE POLLS BECAUSE THIS IS THE\nREALITY OF WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH RIGHT NOW IN SEVERAL KEY\nBATTLEGROUND STATES. FROM OHIO TO VIRGINIA YOU'VE GOT\nMRS. CLINTON LEADING FROM 2.8 UP TO 11.2 PERCENTAGE POINTS.\nHOW DO YOU TURN THAT AROUND AT THIS POINT?\n>> WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY EARLY IN THAT SENSE.\nI MEAN, AT THIS STAGE OF THE CAMPAIGN, GEORGE BUSH 41 WAS\nBEHIND MICHAEL DUKAKIS BY 16%. BY 16%.\nAT THIS POINT IN THE CAMPAIGN RONALD REAGAN WAS BEHIND JIMMY\nCARTER BY NUMBERS FAIRLY SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU JUST SHOWED RIGHT\nTHERE. IN FACT, SOME OF THOSE ARE\nWITHIN THE MARGIN OF ERROR. SO I'M NOT CONCERNED AT ALL.\nI THINK DONALD TRUMP THIS WEEK HAD AN EXCELLENT WEEK, MUCH,\nMUCH BETTER THAN HILLARY CLINTON.\nIN FACT, SHE KIND OF DISAPPEARED FOR THE WEEK EXCEPT FOR HER ONE\nAPPEARANCE THAT I REMEMBER WHERE SHE SAT WITH A COUPLE OF\nDEMOCRATIC APPOINTED POLICE CHIEFS TRYING TO CLAIM THAT SHE\nHAS POLICE SUPPORT. AND I DON'T KNOW A SINGLE COP IN\nTHE UNITED STATES THAT SUPPORTS HER.\nAND I KNOW A LOT OF COPS. AND --\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT -- >> WHAT HE DID THIS WEEK WAS HE\nOUTLINED IN GREAT DETAIL WHAT HE WANTS FOR THIS COUNTRY, ABOUT\nISLAMIC TERRORISM, ABOUT THE ECONOMY, ABOUT BRINGING JOBS\nBACK. HE THEN MADE AN AUDIBLE, MEANING\nHE CHANGED HIS SCHEDULE TO GO TO LOUISIANA TO BRING ATTENTION TO\nTHE PEOPLE OF LOUISIANA WHILE THE PRESIDENT, YOU KNOW, IS\nSTILL UP THERE IN WHEREVER HE IS PLAYING GOLF.\n>> THE PRESIDENT SAYS, OF COURSE, HE'S GOING DOWN ON\nTUESDAY. BUT THAT WAS PART OF A VERY BUSY\nWEEK FOR MR. TRUMP. LET'S TALK THROUGH SOME OF THE\nSPEECHES THAT HE'S GOTTEN A LOT OF PRAISE FOR.\nFIRST ONE YOU TALKED ABOUT HE'S OUTLINED HIS PLAN TO GO AFTER --\nTO STOP RADICAL ISLAM. HE TALKED ABOUT EXTREME VETTING.\nWE ALSO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF HIS GENERAL ELECTION AD NOW AIRING\nIN SEVERAL KEY BATTLEGROUND STATES.\n>> IN HILLARY CLINTON'S AMERICA, THE SYSTEM STAYS RIGGED AGAINST\nAMERICANS. SYRIAN REFUGEES FLOOD IN.\nILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS CONVICTED OF COMMITTING CRIMES GET TO STAY,\nCOLLECTING SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS, SKIPPING THE LINE.\nOUR BORDER OPEN, IT'S MORE OF THE SAME BUT WORSE.\n>> CRITICS SAY POINTING TO THE IMAGERY IN THAT AD AND SAYS THAT\nIT PAINTS IMMIGRANTS IN A DISCRIMINATORY FASHION OR USES\nSCARE TACTICS. THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE WORDS\n\"EXTREME VETTING\" MEANS. CAN YOU TELL US?\n>> EXTREME VETTING MEANS FROM COUNTRIES THAT HOUSE TERRORISTS,\nCOUNTRIES FROM WHICH ATTACKS ON THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN\nLAUNCHED, THERE IS GOING TO BE A VERY, VERY STRICT TEST IN ORDER\nTO GET INTO THE UNITED STATES. YOU DON'T HAVE A RIGHT TO COME\nTO THE UNITED STATES. THERE'S NO SUCH RIGHT TO COME TO\nTHE UNITED STATES. SO WE SHOULD BE TAKING IN PEOPLE\nWHO BELIEVE IN US, WHO BELIEVE IN WHAT WE BELIEVE IN, AND WHO\nARE DEDICATED TO THE PRINCIPAL OF A NATION OF LAWS, NOT SHARIAH\nLAW BUT AMERICAN LAW. AND FROM CERTAIN COUNTRIES WHERE\nWE'VE HAD PROBLEMS, IT'S GOING TO BE PRETTY HARD TO GET IN.\nAND IT SHOULD BE. FOR EXAMPLE, TAKING IN SYRIAN\nREFUGEES, WHICH HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO INCREASE BY 550%,\nTHAT'S 5 1/2 TIMES MORE THAN OBAMA HAS BROUGHT IN.\nSHE WANTS TO BE THE ANGELA MERKEL OF THE U.S.\nISIS HAS TOLD US THEY ARE GOING TO PUT TERRORIST OPERATIVES IN\nWITH THOSE SYRIAN REFUGEES. THEY'VE ACTUALLY TOLD US.\nNOW, WE WOULD HAVE TO BE STUPID TO ALLOW THEM TO COME INTO THE\nUNITED STATES. WE WOULD HAVE TO BE OUT OF OUR\nMINDS. WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS SET UP A\nNO-FLY ZONE IN SYRIA AND PUT THEM THERE.\nKEEP THEM IN THEIR COUNTRY SO THEY'RE NOT FLOODINGY.\nLOOK AT HOUSE CLIMATE HAS GONE UP IN GERMANY SINCE THEY'VE\nALLOWED SYRIAN REFUGEES IN. ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU HAD TERROR\nATTACKS IN THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT PLACES IN GERMANY.\nWE DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN IN THE UNITED STATES.\nWE HAVE ENOUGH HOME GROWN PROBLEMS THAN TO BRING IN A\nBUNCH OF SYRIAN REFUGEES. I'M SURE MANY OF WHOM ARE\nLEGITIMATE PEOPLE, BUT WE'VE BEEN TOLD THEY ARE GOING TO HIDE\nTERRORISTS WITH THEM. AND HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO\nINCREASE THAT BY FIVE TIMES. SO SHE WANTS TO MAKE THE RISK\nFIVE TIMES WORSE THAN IT ALREADY IS.\nWE ALREADY HAVE 1,000 INVESTIGATIONS ACCORDING TO THE\nDIRECTOR OF THE FBI OF TERRORISTS HERE IN THE UNITED\nSTATES. SHE WANTS TO ADD TO THE 1,000\nINVESTIGATIONS. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT ANOTHER\nSPEECH MR. TRUMP GAVE THIS WOKE. HE DID SOMETHING WE HAVE NOT\nSEEN BEFORE, AT LEAST PUBLICLY. HE TALKED ABOUT HAVING REGRETS.\n>> SOMETIMES IN THE HEAT OF DEBATE AND SPEAKING ON A\nMULTITUDE OF ISSUES, YOU DON'T CHOOSE THE RIGHT WORDS OR YOU\nSAY THE WRONG THING. I HAVE DONE THAT.\nBELIEVE IT OR NOT, I REGRET IT. >> HE IS STILL THE SAME MAN WHO\nINSULTS GOLD STAR FAMILIES, DEMEANS WOMEN, MOCKS PEOPLE WITH\nDISABILITIES AND THINKS HE KNOWS MORE ABOUT ISIS THAN OUR\nGENERALS. THERE IS NO NEW DONALD TRUMP.\nTHIS IS IT. >> DO YOU THINK HE CAN WIN OVER\nHIS CRITICS, CONVINCE THEM HE'S TRULY SORRY?\n>> FIRST OF ALL, I'D LIKE TO SEE HER APOLOGIZE FOR HER LYING TO\nGOLD STAR MOTHERS ENSHE GAVE THEM A FALSE NARRATIVE OF HOW\nTHEIR SONS WERE KILLED AT BENGHAZI AND SAID IT WAS ABOUT A\nMOHAMMED VIDEO WHEN SHE DARN WELL KNEW IT WAS A TERRORIST\nATTACK BECAUSE SHE TOLD HER DAUGHTER THAT IN AN E-MAIL, THE\nNIGHT BEFORE OR THE NIGHT BEFORE THAT.\nI'D LIKE TO SEE HER APOLOGIZE FOR ALL THE MONEY THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION IS TAKING, LET'S SAY, FROM SAUDI ARABIA, WHERE WOMEN\nARE NOT ALLOWED TO DRIVE. YOU TELL ME SHE'S A FEMINIST AND\nSHE TAKES MONEY FROM A COUNTRY WHERE WOMEN ARE NOT ALLOWED TO\nDRIVE? YOU TELL ME SHE'S A FEMINIST\nWHEN SHE SPENDS A LOT OF TIME COVERING UP THE MISDEEDS OF HER\nHUSBAND AND ENGAGE IN A LOT OF THE ATTACKS ON THE WOMEN WHO\nWERE TELLING THE TRUTH? SHE'S A FEMINIST EXCEPT WHEN IT\nCOMES TO HER HUSBAND WHERE SHE ATTACKS THE WOMEN WHO ARE\nTELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT HIM. SHE DESERVES TO GIVE THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE AN APOLOGY. SHE CERTAINLY SHOULD GIVE US AN\nAPOLOGY FOR HAVING BEEN FOUND COMPLETELY CARELESS IN HANDLING\nNATIONAL SECURITY AS AN ISSUE. JIM COMEY SAID THAT.\nSHE SHOULD APOLOGIZE FOR LYING ON THIS SHOW ABOUT WHAT JIM\nCOMEY SAID. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO --\n>> WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THAT, BUT WITH THE SPECIFIC FOCUS ON\nHIM, DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE WRITTEN HIM\nOFF BECAUSE OF SOME OF HIS COMMENTS, DO YOU THINK THEY'LL\nACCEPT THAT EXPRESSION OF REGRET, NOT AN APOLOGY, DO YOU\nTHINK IT'S ENOUGH? >> I THINK IT IS.\nI THINK YOU'LL SEE THAT THROUGHOUT THE REST O THE\nCAMPAIGN. DONALD TRUMP IS EXTREMELY\nFOCUSED NOW. IF YOU LOOK AT THIS ENTIRE WEEK,\nYOU CAN SEE IT WAS FOCUSED ON ISSUES, HARD ISSUES, TOUGH\nISSUES, ISSUES ON WHICH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AGREE WITH HIM\nAND WITH US, MAYBE 60, 65%. 65 TO 70% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\nBELIEVE THE COUNTRY IS GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.\nAND IF HE CAN CONVINCE THEM THAT HE IS THE PERSON TO LEAD US,\nTHEN CERTAINLY HE'S THE ONLY ONE TO GIVE US CHANGE.\nWHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO -- THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS NO\nCAMPAIGN. SHE HARDLY APPEARED THIS WEEK.\nI DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE WAS. >> WHY IS SHE DOING SO WELL IN\nTHE POLLS? >> WHY?\n>> IT'S WORKING FOR HER. >> WHAT'S WORKING FOR HER IS SHE\nHAS AN ENTIRE -- READ MICHAEL  POST.\nSHE DOESN'T NEED A CAMPAIGN, SHE HAS \"THE NEW YORK TIMES,\" THE\nDAILY NEWS, CBS, NBC. SHE HAS ENTIRE MEDIA EMPIRE THAT\nCONSTANTLY DEMONIZES DONALD TRUMP AND FAILS TO POINT OUT\nTHAT SHE HASN'T HAD A PRESS CONFERENCE IN 300 DAYS, 200\nDAYS, 100 DAYS, I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG.\nFAILS TO POINT OUT SEVERAL SIGNS OF ILLNESS BY HER.\nALL YOU GOT TO DO IS GO ONLINE --\n>> HER CAMPAIGN AND PEOPLE DEFENDING HER SAYING THERE IS\nNOTHING FACTUAL TO THE CLAIMS ABOUT HER HEALTH AND THAT'S\nSPECULATION AT BEST. >> SO GO ONLINE AND PUT DOWN\nHILLARY CLINTON'S ILLNESS, TAKE A LOOK AT VIDEOS FOR YOURSELF.\n>> I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GET TO SOMETHING THAT'S CRITICISM\nCOMING FROM WITHIN THE PARTY AND GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO ANSWER\nTHAT. THIS WEEK REPUBLICANS FORMER\nLAWMAKERS, TOP GOP LEADERS WROTE A LETTER TO REINCE PRIEBUS\nURGING HIM TO DIVERT HIS MONEY AWAY FROM THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND\nANY MONEY AVAILABLE TO THE DOWN-BALLOT RACES.\nSAYING, QUOTE, WE BELIEVE THAT DONALD TRUMP'S DIVISIVENESS,\nRECKLESSNESS, INCOMPETENCE AND RECORD BREAKING UNPOPULARITY\nRISK TURNING THIS ELECTION INTO A DEMOCRATIC LANDSLIDE AND ONLY\nTHE IMMEDIATE SHIFT OF ALL AVAILABLE RNC RESOURCES TO\nVULNERABLE SNET AND HOUSE RACES WILL PREVENT THE GOP FROM\nDROWNING WITH A TRUMP-EMBLAZONED ANCHOR AROUND HIS NECK.\nYOUR RESPONSE. >> YOU KNOW, THE MOST AMAZING\nTHING TO ME IS THAT REPUBLICANS WOULD DO THAT TO OTHER\nREPUBLICANS. I HAD THE GREAT HONOR AND\nPRIVILEGE OF WORKING FOR RONALD REAGAN.\nIN FACT, HE'S THE ONLY PRESIDENT I'VE WORKED FOR.\nHE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT THE ELEVENTH COMMANDMENT WAS DON'T\nATTACK ANOTHER REPUBLICAN. I'M EMBARRASSED FOR THE PEOPLE\nTHAT WROTE THAT. I'M ALSO EMBARRASSED FOR HOW\nFRIGHTnd THEY GOT SO QUICKLY WHICH IS NOT A SIGN OF\nLEADERSHIP. I WROTE A BOOK ABOUT LEADERSHIP.\nONE CHAPTER IS ABOUT COURAGE. THE REALITY IS HE'S NOT THAT FAR\nBEHIND. HE'S WELL WITHIN STRIKING RANGE\nWITHIN EVERY ONE OF THE KEY STATES AND A COUPLE OF OTHER\nSTATES THAT REPUBLICANS DON'T HAVE A CHANCE OF WINNING.\nSO THIS IS UNNECESSARY FEAR ON THEIR PART.\nAND I'M SORT OF REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN THEM.\nBUT LOOK, DONALD TRUMP IS NOT A TYPICAL REPUBLICAN DEMOCRAT\nLIBERAL CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE. THIS IS AN INSIDER VERSUS\nOUTSIDER CAMPAIGN. SHE IS THE CONSUMMATE CORRUPT\nWASHINGTON INSIDER, AND SHE IS THOROUGHLY CORRUPT.\nAND SO IS THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nIF I WERE BACK IN MY OLD JOB AS U.S. ATTORNEY, I WOULD PROBABLY\nINDICT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION AS A RACKETEERING ENTERPRISE.\nTHEY TOOK MONEY FROM MONEY LAUNDERERS, CRIMINALS,\nDICTATORS, PEOPLE WHO ABUSE WOMEN AS A MATTER OF GOVERNMENT\nPOLICY. SHE DID FAVORS FOR THOSE VERY\nPEOPLE WHO GAVE MONEY TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nFOR EXAMPLE, UBS GAVE THE CLINTONS ALTOGETHER OVER A\nMILLION DOLLARS. SHE MADE A CALL TO THE IRS\nASKING THE IRS TO GO EASY ON THEIR ATTEMPTS TO GET IDENTITIES\nFROM UBS. IN MY DAY, THAT WAS CONSIDERED\nBRIBERY WHEN I WAS A U.S. ATTORNEY AND I PROSECUTED\nSEVERAL VERY PROMINENT POLITICIANS AND CONVICTED THEM\nOF BRIBERY -- >> MR. MAYOR --\n>> INCLUDING TWO CONGRESSMEN. >> WE HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE.\nAGAIN, THE CLINTON FOUNDATION AND ALL ASSOCIATED SAY THEY'RE\nNOT UNDER INVESTIGATION AND THEY'VE BEEN CLEAR AND\nTRANSPARENT. SO WE'LL STAY TUNED BECAUSE\nTHERE ARE THOSE THAT ARE -- >> THAT'S THE BIGGEST BUNCH OF\nGARBAGE I'VE EVER HEARD. >> MR. MAYOR, APPRECIATE YOUR\nTIME TOGETHER. >> THEY ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION.\nTHERE WAS A LEAK TO THAT JUST THE OTHER DAY.\nNUMBER TWO, IF THEY'RE NOT, THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE\nASHAMED OF ITSELF. >> WE'VE GOT TO LEAVE IT THERE.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING FOX NEWS SUNDAY, SIR.\n>> THANK YOU. >> UP NEXT, HILLARY CLINTON IS\nRISING IN THE POLLS BUT COULD NEW QUESTIONS ABOUT HER E-MAIL\nTESTIMONY HURT HER CAMPAIGN? A TOP CLINTON SUPPORTER BEN\nCARDIN JOINS US. PLUS, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT\nTRUMP'S CAMPAIGN SHUFFLE? IS IT GOING TO GIVE HIM THE\nKICKSTART HE NEEDS? LET US KNOW @FOXNEWSSUNDAY,\nPLEASE USE THE # FNS.                      delined.",

ABOUT HALF WENT TO A WEB DESIGN\nFIRM, MORE AIR TRAVEL AND CONSULTANTS.\nALL OF THAT AS MR. TRUMP SAYS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS TO\nREACH OUT MORE TO AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS.\nWANT TO BRING IN OUR PANEL RIGHT NOW.\nED ROLLINS, FORMER CAMPAIGN MANAGER FOR THE REAGAN-BUSH\nTICKET IN 1984. JULIE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST AND\nFOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR. MARY KISSELL IS WITH US, MEMBER\nOF THE EDITORIAL BOARD OF \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL.\"\nTHANK YOU TO EVERYBODY FOR JOINING US.\nIN TERMS OF MONEY RAISED, THEY HAD A GOOD JULY, ED, BUT THE WAY\nTHE MONEY SPENT IS A VERY DIFFERENT WAY.\n>> BIG DONORS HAVE NOT TOTALLY KICKED IN, AND MY SENSE IS THEY\nMAY NOT AT THE END OF THE DAY. BUT HE HAS ENOUGH MONEY TO KEEP\nMOVING FORWARD. THE CRITICAL THING, HE HAS TO\nBUILD A GROUND GAME. IF THIS COMES TO A 3% OR 4%\nRACE, THAT'S WHERE IT IS. NOW ON TV, THEY HAVE THEIR FIRST\nTV AD ON. I THINK HE'S MUCH MORE\nDISCIPLINED. I THINK THIS NEW TEAM, STEVE\nBANNON AND KELLYANNE IS A QUALITY PROFESSIONAL.\nAND I THINK THIS IS A TEAM. THEY GOT TO TAKE IT ACROSS THE\nFINISH LINE. AND CERTAINLY MANAFORT WAS NOT\nGOING TO DO THAT. >> YEAH, I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY,\nJULIE, HE'S HAD A POSITIVE REACTION TO THIS NEW TEAM IN\nPLACE SO FAR. IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S ALSO GETTING\nA BUMP IN THE POLLS. >> WELL, HE HAS, BUT LET'S SEE\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT WEEK. EVERY TIME TRUMP DOES SOMETHING\nTHAT'S GOOD FOR 24 OR 48 HOURS, ALL THE CRITICS SAY THE PIVOT IS\nHERE, IT'S FINALLY COMING, IT NEVER COMES.\nI WILL SAY HIS FORMER CAMPAIGN TEAM, AND ED, I THINK YOU'LL\nAGREE TO ME, COMMITTED MALPRACTICE.\nTHIS IS MONEY THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SPENT ON A GROUND GAME.\nHE WAS GOUGED BY HIS CONSULTANTS, GOUGED BY THE\nPEOPLE HE PAID. THEY'RE NOT GIVING HIM GOOD\nADVICE. THEY SHOULD HAVE PUT THIS ON TV,\nON THE AIR, ON THE GROUND. NOT WHAT THEY DID WITH IT WHICH\nIS ESSENTIALLY POCKET THE MONEY. MALPRACTICE OF THE HIGHEST\nDEGREE. >> AT THE SAME TIME HILLARY\nCLINTON HAS SPENT ALL OF HER MONEY ON JUST THAT.\n>> EXACTLY RIGHT. >> MARY, WHAT DO YOU THINK?\n>> I'M NOT SURE YOU CAN BLAME THE CONSULTANTS FULLY HOWEVER.\nDONALD TRUMP IS DONALD TRUMP. AND HE'S MADE THIS CAMPAIGN\nABOUT HIMSELF. WHY WAS THERE SO MUCH ATTENTION\nTO THIS ONE WORD REGRET IN HIS SPEECH ON FRIDAY, IT'S BECAUSE\nWE'RE FOCUSING ON DONALD TRUMP'S FEELINGS.\nWE'RE NOT FOCUSING ON HIS POLICY IDEAS OR WHY THEY'RE BETTER THAN\nHILLARY CLINTON'S. I THINK, LOOK, HE KNEW THAT THE\nCAMPAIGN WAS SPIRALING DOWNWARDS.\nHE'S NOT LEADING IN ANY OF THE POLLS.\nTHERE'S THE PROSPECT OF LOSING THE SENATE.\nIT'S A GOOD SIGN THAT HE BROUGHT IN A PRO LIKE KELLYANNE CONWAY\nAS A POLLSTER. BUT HE HAS TO PROVE THAT HE NOT\nONLY HAS THE TEMPERAMENT TO BE IN OFFICE, BUT THAT HE CAN\nSUSTAIN SOME OF THESE MESSAGES THAT HE STARTED TO LAY OUT IN\nTHESE SPEECHES LAST WEEK. WE'LL SEE, BUT THE POLLS DON'T\nCHANGE OVERNIGHT. >> CAN HE DO THAT?\n>> I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAS THE CHARACTER TO DO IT.\nHE HASN'T PROVED SO FAR. HE ISN'T STUDYING ANY POLICY\nMEASURES. WE DON'T HAVE SPECIFICS ON WHAT\nWOULD REPLACE OBAMACARE, HOW HE WOULD DEFEAT ISIS, THE TAX PLAN,\nFOR INSTANCE. IF YOU READ THE SPEECHES, THERE\nARE A LOT OF GOOD THEMES IN THERE.\nI'M GLAD THAT HE SUPPORTS CHARTER SCHOOLS.\nI'M GLAD HE WANTS TO GET RID OF REGULATORY TAPE.\nI'M GLAD HE WANTS TO UNLEASH AMERICAN ENERGY.\nTHAT'S VERY POSITIVE. >> YEAH.\n>> THIS WAS A VERY WINNABLE CAMPAIGN.\nI THINK IF YOU HAD THAT CAMPAIGN STRUCTURE IN PLACE THAT JULIA\nWAS TALKING ABOUT. >> YEAH.\n>> AND YOU HAD A MORE DISCIPLINED CANDIDATE, HE'D BE\nAHEAD BY 10 OR 20 POINTS AT THIS TIME IN THE RACE.\n>> NEWT GINGRICH LAID OUT A FEW MINUTES AGO ON YOUR SHOW THE\nOFFENSE THEY NEED TO BE ON. IF THIS CAMPAIGN COMES DOWN TO\nBE ABOUT HIM AND HIS CONTROVERSIES, AND HE'S NOT\nGOING TO WIN. IF IT'S ABOUT HER AND THE\nMISS -- THE MISFIRES SHE'S DONE, I DON'T WANT TO SAY MISDEMEANOR\nCRIMES BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE CHARGING SOMEONE WITH A CRIME,\nBUT I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY THE VULNERABILITY'S THERE.\nTHE COMBINATION OF OBAMA AND WHAT THEY HAVE DONE AND PAYING\nTHE IRANIAN HOSTAGES, WHAT HAVE YOU, THERE'S SO MUCH STUFF\nTHERE, NEWT LAID IT OUT WELL. >> YEAH.\nTHE PROBLEM THOUGH IS AND THIS CONTINUES TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S\nA CONCERN FOR HIM IS THAT MARY'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, HE CAN'T LAY\nIT OUT. GINGRICH MAY HAVE LAID IT OUT,\nHE CAN'T FOCUS ON HER, HE HAS TO CONSTITUTIONALLY ONLY FOCUS ON\nHIMSELF. THAT'S NOT WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO\nHEAR. >> IT'S PATHOLOGICAL, PEOPLE\nWANT TO HEAR HOW HE'S GOING TO IMPROVE THEIR LIVES.\nNOT WHAT HE FEELS ABOUT HIMSELF. >> I DON'T THINK YOU CAN JUST DO\nIT ON TWITTER AND FACEBOOK AND AT RALLIES.\nIT WAS GOOD THAT HE WENT TO LOUISIANA, BUT LET'S SEE HIM GO\nTO A CHARTER SCHOOL IN THE BRONX.\nLET'S SEE HIM GO INTO DOWNTOWN L.A., HAVE MORE PRESS GAGGLES,\nGET OUT THERE, MEET VOTERS. PROVE THAT YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT\nTHESE COMMUNITIES. I THINK KELLYANNE WILL TRY TO\nPUSH HIM IN THAT DIRECTION, BUT ULTIMATELY IT'S UP TO THE\nCANDIDATE HIMSELF. >> HE LIKES THE RALLIES, BUT THE\nPROBLEM WITH RALLIES IS IT'S JUST A SMALL AUDIENCE IN FRONT\nOF YOU WHETHER IT'S 7,000 OR 10,000.\nI REMIND THEM 100,000 PEOPLE WERE AT MONDALE'S RALLY.\n>> THERE YOU GO.

YOU'VE SEEN A LOT OF NEGATIVE\nADS AGAINST DONALD TRUMP BUT SOME OF THE MONEY COMING IN FOR\nTRUMP IS ALSO COMING IN THROUGH THE RNC.\nSO SOME OF THAT MONEY HAS TO BE SPENT ON THE RNC AND ITS\nEXPENSES. EVEN IF IT'S A BIG BLOCKBUSTER\nJULY, ALL OF THAT MONEY IS NOT BEING SPENT ON WHAT HE NEEDS,\nGROUNDWORK, ORGANIZATION, AND THE NEGATIVE ADS.\n>> TEN WEEKS LEFT AND WE'VE SEEN SEEING BILLBOARDS POPPING UP IN\nSTATES LIKE CALIFORNIA PAID FOR BY THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND IN\nVIRGINIA WHERE HE'S DOWN BY 11 POINTS.\nIS THAT A GOOD MARSHALING OF THE MONEY BY THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN?\n>> THIS IS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE PARTY NOT BEING ALL IN\nON TRUMP RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THAT IS GETTING IN THE WAY HERE\nBECAUSE SOME OF THE MONEY IS GOING TOWARD, LIKE I SAID, RNC\nEXPENSES.

WE CAN COMPLAIN ABOUT ERDOGAN\nALL WE LIKE, BUT HE'S IN A TOUGH, TOUGH POSITION BETWEEN\nMILITARY DISCONTENT AND THE ISLAMIC STATE.\nTHAT'S A WIDE OPEN BORDER. THIS CONFLICT IN SYRIA IS GOING\nTO HAVE A LONG-TERM EFFECT ON TURKEY.\nI'M CONVINCED OF IT. >> SO WHAT DOES THE UNITED\nSTATES DO, RIGHT?

TURKEY, OF COURSE, IS A NATO\nALLY AND CENTRAL PLAYER IN THE U.S. FIGHT AGAINST ISIS, WHICH\nIS WHY THERE ARE CONCERNS IN WASHINGTON OVER TURKISH\nPRESIDENT ERDOGAN'S WARMING TIES WITH RUSSIA.\nBUT IN THE WAKE OF THIS WEEKEND'S MASSACRE AT THAT\nWEDDING IN TURKEY, WHAT CAN WE EXPECT GOING FORWARD WITH OUR\nNATO ALLY? JOINING ME NOW TO TALK ABOUT\nTHIS IS RETIRED NAVY CAPTAIN BOB WELLS, A FORMER NATIONAL\nSECURITY ADVISER TO VICE PRESIDENT DICK CHENEY.\nCAPTAIN WELLS, GOOD TO HAVE YOU. >> THANK YOU, ARTHEL.\n>> LOTS TO TALK ABOUT. LET'S START HERE.\nLAST MONTH, TURKEY'S PRESIDENT CALLED ON NATO TO DO MORE TO\nFIGHT ISIS. IS NATO EQUIPPED TO ANSWER THE\nCALL? AND ARE THE NATO ALLIES DOING\nENOUGH TO ASSIST TURKEY, AND IN WHAT AREAS IS NATO'S HELP MOST\nNEEDED? >> I THINK THE CALL IS\nIMPORTANT. AND CERTAINLY FOCUSING ON TURKEY\nI THINK WOULD BE THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE.\nHOW WELL HAVE THEY BEEN AN ALLY? CERTAINLY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE\nCOUP ATTEMPT WAS THE GENESIS OF MR. ERDOGAN'S CALL FOR\nADDITIONAL HELP FROM NATO. THE TURKISH MILITARY IS REALLY\nHAMPERED BY THE POST COUP ENVIRONMENT.\nTHEY DO NEED HELP. I THINK NATO COULD HELP WITH\nADDITIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND WARNING CAPABILITY.\nTHEY ARE ALREADY HELPING IN TURKEY AT INCIRLIK AIR BASE ABLE\nTO DO MISSIONS INSIDE OF SYRIA AND ALSO SUPPORTING GREATER\nFREEDOM OF MOVEMENT OF NATO FORCES, IF THAT WOULD BE\nSOMETHING THAT THE TURKISH WOULD WELCOME.\nESPECIALLY DURING IN THAT KEYBOARDER AREA WHERE THIS\nLATEST SUICIDE ATTACK OCCURRED. >> A COUPLE OF THINGS THERE\nPOPPING INTO MY MIND BASED ON WHAT YOU JUST SAID, CAPTAIN\nWELLS. FIRST OF ALL, YOU'VE GOT RUSSIA\nNOW FLYING, BEING ALLOWED TO FLY OUT OF INCIRLIK AS WELL.\nWHAT DOES THAT MEAN? AND ALSO THE U.S. HAD, YOU KNOW,\nWARNED TURKEY IN THE PAST SAYING HEY, LOOK, YOU'VE GOT TO DO\nSOMETHING ABOUT THIS POROUS BORDER BETWEEN TURKEY AND SYRIA.\nTHAT'S COME BACK TO BITE THEM. >> INDEED IT HAS.\nI RECALL JUDITH MILLER ON YOUR PREVIOUS SEGMENT MENTIONING THE\nNUMBER OF TIMES THE UNITED STATES DIPLOMATS HAVE REINFORCED\nTHAT PARTICULAR MESSAGE WITH REGARD TO HAVING TO DEAL WITH\nTHE BORDER. ON INCIRLIK AND THE RUSSIAN, THE\nACCESS TO THE AIR BASE IN INCIRLIK, I DISCOUNT THAT\nSOMEWHAT WITH REGARD TO THE GREATER INTERESTS OF TURKEY,\nESPECIALLY THE GREATER INTERESTS WITH NATO ITSELF.\nYOU MENTIONED VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN HEADING OUT TO MEET WITH\nTURKEY AND PRESIDENT ERDOGAN COMING UP IN ANKARA NEXT WEEK.\nIT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT BEFORE HE GETS TO ANKARA, VICE\nPRESIDENT BIDEN IS ALSO GOING TO THE BALTIC STATES.\nHE'LL BE METING WITH THE PRESIDENTS OF LATVIA, ESTONIA,\nLATVIA AND HE IS ALSO GOING TO GO TO SWEDEN.\nRUSSIA IS FRONT AND CENTER WITH REGARD TO THE GEOPOLITICS HERE.\nI THINK MR. ERDOGAN IS TRYING TO LEVERAGE A NEW POLICY WITH\nRUSSIA AGAINST THE UNITED STATES AS THESE OTHER ISSUES BETWEEN\nU.S. AND TURKEY GET UNPACKED. >> YEAH, BECAUSE AS YOU WELL\nKNOW, WHAT YOU'RE POINTING TO NOW IS TURKEY'S IMPROVED TIES\nWITH RUSSIA IN THE ANTI-ISIS FIGHT HAS CONCERNED THE WEST.\nI MEAN, WHAT HAS THE U.S. DONE OR PERHAPS NOT DONE TO OPEN THE\nDOOR TO THIS RENEWED POLITICAL COZINESS BETWEEN PUTIN AND\nERDOGAN? >> I THINK WE'VE BEEN BEHIND IN\nTERMS OF OUR DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS. I NOTE THAT YOU HAVE TO FOCUS ON\nTURKEY AS A KEY ALLY, AS WAS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY AND WAS\nNOTED THROUGHOUT THE WEEK. IT'S AN INCREDIBLYTANT\nPARTNER IN THIS ENTIRE ANTI-TERRORISM, ANTI-ISIS FIGHT\nWITH SYRIA. ALSO THE BROADER MIDDLE EAST\nWITH REGARD TO PEACE. ISTANBUL AND ANKARA ARE KEY,\nPOLITICAL HUBS WITH REGARD TO COMMUNICATION IN THE MIDDLE\nEAST. I THINK THE UNITED STATES IS\nPLAYING CATCH-UP. I THINK MR. BIDEN'S TRIP IS A\nLITTLE BIT LATE. I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN\nTHERE ABOUT A MONTH AGO AFTER THE COUP.\nI NOTE THAT GENERAL DUNFORD, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF\nSTAFF WENT THROUGHOUT TO MEET WITH THE TURKISH MILITARY ABOUT\nTWO WEEKS OF THE COUP TO REASSURE A TREND, AN ALLY THAT\nWE'RE THERE WITH YOU STILL. I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO\nGET BACK ON STEP WITH REGARD TO THE RELATIONSHIP.\nWELL STILL HAVE QUITE A BIT OF THE MOMENTUM FROM THE WARSAW\nNATO SUMMIT IN JULY. AND I THINK TURKEY WILL PICK THE\nRIGHT CHOICE STILL OVERALL WITH REGARD TO THEIR NATIONAL\nINTERESTS AS OPPOSED TO THE PERSONAL INTERESTS SOMETIMES\nPRESIDENT ERDOGAN. >> MORE QUESTIONS IN MY MIND.\nBUT I'M JUST TOLD THAT I HAVE TO LEAVE THERE IT, CAPTAIN BOB\nWELLS. ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE YOU.\nAND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PERSPECTIVE, SIR.\n>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, ARTHEL. GOOD TO SEE YOU.\n>> THANK YOU. SAME HERE.\nERIC? >> WELL, ARTHEL, WHILE WE'RE\nDEEMING WITH TURKEY AND THAT FUTURE OF THAT NATO ALLY, THE\nU.S. AND THE WEST HAVE VOWED TO DESTROY THE RADICAL ISLAMIC\nTERRORISTS OF ISIS. BUT WHAT WILL BE THE RESULT OF\nTHAT? FROM IRAN, CONTINUING OF TESTING\nOF BALLISTIC MISSILES TO REPORTEDLY BACKING AS MANY AS\n100,000 FIGHTERS IN IRAQ THERE ARE TROUBLING PREDICTIONS ABOUT\nTHE FUTURE OF THE MIDDLE EAST. FOX NEWS'S LUCAS TOMLINSON HAS\nMORE. >> DESPITE CLAIMS BY THE U.S.\nCOALITION TO HAVE KILLED 45,000 ISIS FIGHTERS IN IRAQ AND SYRIA,\nA NEW FEAR IS SWEEPING THE U.S. INTELLIGENCE RANKS.\nSHOULD THE ISLAMIC STATE BE DEFEATED, IT MAY SOON BE\nREPLACED BY ANOTHER ANTI-AMERICAN FORCE.\nU.S. MILITARY OFFICIALS TELL FOX THERE ARE NOW UP TO 100,000\nIRANIAN-BACKED FIGHTERS INSIDE IRAQ BATTLING ISIS.\nTHESE ARE THE SAME FIGHTERS WHO RECENTLY THREATENED THE NEARLY\n4,000 U.S. ADVISERS CURRENTLY ON THE GROUND THERE, CALLING THEM\nAN OCCUPYING FORCE. LAST MONTH FIREBRAND SHIA CLERIC\nMUQTADA AL SADR, A LONG-TIME ENEMY OF THE UNITED STATES SAID\nTHIS ABOUT AMERICAN TROOPS, QUOTE, THEY ARE A TARGET FOR US.\nA DECADE AGO THESE SAME IRAN-BACKED FORCES KILLED\nHUNDREDS OF U.S. SOLDIERS IN IRAQ.\n>> DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY SOLDIERS, MARINES UNDERNEATH\nYOUR COMMAND WERE KILLED BY IRANIAN ACTIVITIES?\n>> THE NUMBER HAS BEEN RECENTLY QUOTED AS ABOUT 500.\nWE WERE ALWAYS ABLE TO ATTRIBUTE THE CASUALTIES THAT WE HAD TO\nIRANIAN ACTIVITY, ALTHOUGH MANY TIMES WE SUSPECTED IT WAS\nIRANIAN ACTIVITY. >> ARMED WITH A FRESH INFUSION\nOF CASH FROM THE NUCLEAR DEAL, MILITARY ANALYSTS FEAR IRAN'S\nINFLUENCE IN THE REGION IS GROWING.\nTHE RISE OF THE MILITIAS IS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES LOSING INFLUENCE INSIDE OF IRAQ.\n>> THE IRANIAN NUCLEAR DEAL HAS FREED UP BILLIONS IN BILLIONS OF\nDOLLARS IN CASH FOR IRAN TO SUPPORT THESE MILITIAS INSIDE OF\nIRAQ AS WELL AS INSIDE SYRIA. >> THE U.S. MILITARY SAYS IF\nIRAQI FORCES WANT HELP FROM IRAN, THAT'S UP TO THEM.\n>> IF THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ CHOOSES TO BRING IN OTHER\nADVISERS, THAT'S AN ISSUE FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ.\nWE ARE NOT COORDINATING WITH THE IRANIANS IN ANY WAY.\n>> BUT ONE OF THOSE ADVISERS IS THE MAN WHO LEADS THE\nIRANIAN-BACKED FIGHTERS INSIDE IRAQ.\nIN FEBRUARY 2009, THE U.S. TREASURY DEPARTMENT DESIGNATED\nHIM A TERRORIST. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION SAYS\nMOHANDAS IS AN ADVISER HEAD OF IRAN'S QUDS FORCE.\nTHERE IS TALKS THAT HE IS ONCE AGAIN BACK ON THE GROUND IN\nIRAQ. A SPOKESMAN FOR THE SHIA MILITIA\nSAYS HE WILL PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN THE UPCOMING BATTLE IN MOSUL.\n>> THANKS, LUCAS.",

WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS WHEN\nYOU'RE DEALING WITH A MIND-SET AND A PHILOSOPHY THAT WILL\nSACRIFICE THE INNOCENCE THAT WILL TARGET A WEDDING AND USE A\n12 TO 14-YEAR-OLD CHILD TO DO THIS?\n>> IT REMINDS ME OF THE WOMEN THAT I INTERVIEWED IN AN ISRAELI\nJAIL, PALESTINIAN FAILED FEMALE SUICIDE BOMBERS, ALL OF WHOM\nSAID IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER THAT THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR\nCOMMUNITIES HAD BEEN COMPLICIT IN THEIR WILLINGNESS TO KILL\nTHEMSELVES AND A LOT OF INNOCENT PEOPLE WITH THEM IN ORDER TO\nMAKE A STATEMENT FOR THEIR CAUSE.\nIT IS, AS YOU SAID, A SIGN OF UTTER DEPRAVITY.\nAND IT ALSO SHOWS HOW HARD IT'S GOING TO BE TO DEFEAT ISIS.\nIT'S NOT ENOUGH TO BOMB THEM. YOU CANNOT BOMB THEM INTO\nOBLIVION. YOU'VE GOT TO WORK TO CHANGE\nTHIS CULTURAL AND POLITICAL MIND-SET.\nAND THAT IS GOING TO BE SO DIFFICULT.\nTHAT. >> CHILD HAS GOT TO HAVE\nPARENTS, YOU WOULD THINK, OR AT LEAST PEOPLE WHO TOOK CARE OF\nHIM AND FED HIM AND CLOTHED HIM. IT'S BEYOND WORDS, JUDY.\n>> IT IS. BUT IT'S VERY REFLECTIVE OF THE\nPSYCHOLOGY WHICH SAYS THE NEXT LIFE WILL BE SO MUCH BETTER THAN\nWHAT WE HAVE HERE ON EARTH. AND THEY TAUGHT THAT IT'S JUST\nBEATEN INTO THEM. AND THESE ARE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO\nARE WILLING TO DIE FOR THEIR CAUSE.\nWE MUST NOT UNDERESTIMATE THEM, JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT HERE ON\nOUR SHORES REPEATEDLY, THE WAY THEY ARE IN TURKEY AND JORDAN\nAND SYRIA. THIS IS THE FORCE WE'RE UP\nAGAINST. AND THIS IS WHY IT'S REALLY\nGOING TO TAKE A LOT OF PATIENCE AND PERSEVERANCE TO DEFEAT THEM.\n>> THIS IS THE FORCE WE ARE UP AGAINST.\nJUDY MILLER REMINDS US OF THAT.

AND ALSO BECAUSE OF THE\nPERCEPTION AND REALITY THAT ERDGON, IT'S A KEY PART BECAUSE\nTHE U.S. IS TRYING AIR STRIKES ON ISIS AND IN SYRIA, IT'S A BIG\nPART OF THE U.S. COALITION IN SYRIA, AND THERE'S A LOT OF\nCONCERN THERE, ARTHEL. >> INDEED, A VERY SAD SITUATION.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH.

AN ADULT TOLD THEM TO DO THIS,\nAND GAVE THEM THE SUICIDE BELT, AND TOLD THEM WHAT TO DO.\nIT THREATENS THE INNOCENCE OF CHILDREN AND OF TURKEY.\n>> THEIR STATE SPONSORS, THAT'S A FOOL'S ERRAND.\nWHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE IN TURKEY IS WHAT DIRECTION ERDGON'S\nATTACKS AND ESPECIALLY GIVEN HIS TRIP TO MOSCOW, AND HE AGREES\nWITH VLADIMIR PUTIN. THE CONFLICT IN SYRIA IS IRAQ IS\nVERY COMPLEX AND THERE ARE MORE THAN TWO SIDES.\nWHILE THE INSTANT REACTION MIGHT BE THAT THIS MEANS THAT TURKEY\nWILL TAKE MORE STEPS AGAINST ISIS, IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT --\nTHAT'S THE WAY THEY ARE GOING TO GO.\nWILL THEY GIVE UP THE WAR AGAINST ASSAD, AND DOES THAT\nMEAN THEY GIVE UP THE FORCES OPPOSED TO ASSAD?\nAND DOES THAT MEAN FOR THE PEOPLE IN TURKEY?\nI DON'T THINK IT'S A QUESTION OF THE STABILITY OF TURKEY, BUT THE\nDIRECTION THEY WILL GO IN. >> WE JUST SHOWED A PHOTOGRAPH\nOF HE WITH PUTIN, AND HE WAS PRAISING PUTIN, AND THEY ARE\nTIPPING TO RUSSIA. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN WILL BE\nTHERE ON WEDNESDAY. WHAT CAN HE SAY?\nWHAT WILL HE SAY? >> WELL, I THINK WE'RE VERY\nCLOSE TO THE POINT WHERE TURKEY IS GOING TO SPIN OUT OF THE\nWESTERN ORBIT ENTIRELY. ERDOWAN IS GETTING USED TO THE\nSECULAR CONSTITUTION, AND USING THE FAILED MILITARY COUP TO WIPE\nOUT HIS POLITICAL OPPOSITION. THERE WAS NEWS FROM TURKEY THAT\nRELEASED THEY RELEASED 30,000 CRIMINAL PRISONERS, TO MAKE ROOM\nFOR THE POLITICAL PRISONERS THAT HE IS ARRESTING.\nAND I THINK THE REPORTS OF POSSIBLY ALLOWING RUSSIAN PLANES\nTO USE THE BASE COMBINED WITH RUSSIAN PLANES USING AIR BASES\nIN IRAN TO ATTACK OPPONENTS OF THE ASSAD REGIME, ALL OF THIS\nPUT IN CONTEXT REFLECTS A DRAMATIC DEMOLITION OVER\nAMERICAN INFLUENCE, AND THE REGION AS A WHOLE.\nIT'S VERY DANGEROUS, AND BIDEN OUGHT TO BE HAVING A VERY\nSTRAIGHT CONVERSATION. WITH YOU PART OF THE WEST OR\nNOT? >> IT SEEMS HE IS NOT.\nYOU MENTIONED THE NATO AIR BASE THERE.\nSTUNNINGLY, THE PRIME MINISTER SAID THEY MAY ALLOW RUSSIAN\nFORCES TO USE A NATO BASE. LOOK AT WHAT THE FOREIGN\nMINISTER SAID ABOUT THIS. QUOTE, IT SEEMS TO US THAT NATO\nMEMBERS BEHAVE IN AN EVASIVE FASHION ON ISSUES SUCH AS THE\nEXCHANGE OFFING TO AND JOINT INVESTMENTS.\nTURKEY INTENDS TO STRENGTHEN ITS DEFENSE SYSTEM, AND WE ARE READY\nTO CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF COOPERATION IN THIS SECTOR.\nIS THIS THE LANGUAGE OF AN ALLY? IS THIS THE LANGUAGE OF A TRUE\nNATO COUNTRY? >> ABSOLUTELY NOT.\nAND I DON'T THINK THE U.S. AND NATO WANT TO LOSE TURKEY GIVEN\nITS CRITICAL GEOGRAPHIC POSITION AND THE ROLE IT'S PLAYED IN THE\nPAST AND IT COULD PLAY IN THE FUTURE.\nI DON'T THINK A MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE WANT TO GO IN THIS\nDIRECTION. BUT IT MAY BE OUT OF THEIR HANDS\nGIVEN THE CONTROL OVER THE JUDICIARY AND MILITARY AND\nPOLITICAL SYSTEM. HE SAID WHEN HE WAS MAYOR OF\nISTANBUL, DEMOCRACY IS LIKE A STREETCAR.\nYOU DRIVE IT WHERE YOU WANT AND GET OFF.\nHE IS GETTING OFF. HE IS OUT OF NATO ALLIANCE, AND\nTHAT'S WHY BIDEN SHOULD NOT MINCE WORDS.\n>> WHAT WOULD IT MEAN IF RUSSIA LANDED AT THE BASE?\nWHAT WOULD THAT MEAN STRUCTURE AND STABILITY OF THE WESTERN\nWORLD AND DEPENDENCE ON THAT NATION?\n>> WE HAVE A CONFLICT WITH SYRIA AND IRAQ AGAINST ISIS, AND IN\nOTHER STRATEGIC REGIONS. IF THE RUSSIANS TURN UP NEXT\nTOOR TO SPY ON WHAT WE'RE DOING, THE SECURITY WILL BE INCREASED,\nAND IT WILL BE THE THIRD RUSSIAN AIR FACILITY IN THE REGION.\nTHE BASES THEY ARE USING IN IRAN, AND NOW THIS ONE.\nWHERE IS THE UNITED STATES? THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE WE\nSHOULD BE DOMINANT MILITARILY, AND WE'RE BEING REPLACED BY\nRUSSIA, AND THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T SEEM TO CARE THAT MUCH.\n>> IT WOULD BE STUNNING IF THE TURKS ENABLED THAT.\nWE'LL SEE HOW THAT GOES, AND VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN DOES AS YOU\nSAY, LAY A STRONG MESSAGE WHEN THEY MEET ON WEDNESDAY.\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR ANALYSIS.",

            "text": ">>> A CAMPAIGN FUNDRAISER IN\nPROVINCETOWN, MASSACHUSETTS, THIS WEEK THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN\nFACED MORE TOUGH QUESTIONS ON THE LACK OF HER PRESS\nCONFERENCES. CLINTON'S LAST PRESS CONFERENCE\nWHERE SHE ACTUALLY TOOK QUESTIONS FROM REPORTERS WAS ON\nDECEMBER 4, 2015. THAT'S 260 DAYS AGO.\nHER CAMPAIGN MANAGER, ROBBY MOOK, WAS PRESSED ON THIS ON\nTODAY'S \"FACE THE NATION.\" >> IT'S BEEN 260 DAYS SINCE A\nPRESS CONFERENCE, AND SOMEBODY I WAS TALKING TO IN THE WHITE\nHOUSE SAID IF A CANDIDATE CAN'T HAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE, THAT\nWEAKENS THEM WHEN THEY BECOME PRESIDENT, BECAUSE THEY'LL NEED\nTHAT AS A WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\nSO WHY NOT HAVE A PRESS KO CONFERENCE?\n>> WELL, THE REAL QUESTION HERE IS WHETHER PRESIDENT CLINTON HAS\nBEEN TAKING QUESTIONS FROM REPORTERS WHICH SHE ABSOLUTELY\nHAS. WE'VE COUNTED AND SHE HAS BEEN\nIN MORE THAN 300 INTERVIEWS WITH REPORTERS THIS YEAR ALONE.\nSHE'S BEEN ON YOUR SHOW, AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO\nTHAT. THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT\nFORMATS -- >> SALLY KOHN IS BACK WITH ME.\nSHE IS A CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, A HILLARY CLINTON\nSUPPORTER AND WRITER FOR \"THE DAILY BEAST.\"\nALSO WITH ME, TRUMP SUPPORTER. SALLY, YOU'RE A TRUMP SUPPORTER,\nBUT I KNOW YOU WANT TO SEE HER HOLD A PRESS CONFERENCE, AND\nTHIS IS THE RESPONSE THAT WE HEAR OVER AND OVER AGAIN FROM\nTHE CLINTON CAMP. WELL, SHE'S DONE 300 ODD\nINTERVIEWS, ET CETERA, ET CETERA.\nBUT WHY NOT, THEN, JUST HOLD A PRESS CONFERENCE SO THAT PEOPLE\nSTOP ASKING THE QUESTION? >> LOOK, I DON'T KNOW.\nI'M NOT INSIDE HILLARY CLINTON OR ROBBIE MOOK'S HEAD, SO I\nDON'T KNOW. MY SUSPICION HERE IS TWOFOLD.\nONE, SHE'S NOT GREAT AT PRESS CONFERENCES.\nIN A CAMPAIGN WHERE EVERY LITTLE NOT ACTUAL POLICY DETAIL OR\nSUBSTANCE POINT IS CRITIQUED BUT EVERY WINK AND BLINK AND\nMOVEMENT AND WORD CHOICE, WHATEVER, IT'S AN ABUNDANCE OF\nCAUTION. IN THIS CONTEXT I UNDERSTAND\nTHAT. I SYMPATHIZE WITH THAT EVEN\nTHOUGH IT MIGHT NOT BE THE CHOICE I WOULD MAKE.\nTHE OTHER THING S FRANKLY, AGAIN, SHE'S NOT GOING TO BE IN\nA SITUATION WHERE SHE'S IN A CONVERSATION ONE ON ONE WITH ONE\nREPORTER WHO ASKS ONE QUESTION AS SHE HAS DONE 300 TIMES.\nWE ALL KNOW HOW THIS IS GOING TO PLAY OUT.\nIT'S GOING TO EVOLVE INTO THIS ABOUT THE E-MAILS AND THAT ABOUT\nDONATIONS. >> BUT WHY SHOULDN'T REPORTERS\nASK THOSE QUESTIONS? HERE'S THE THING, SALLY.\nWHEN SHE IS PRESSING DONALD TRUMP, WHEN SHE IS PRESSING\nDONALD TRUMP TO BE FULLY TRANSPARENT AND RELEASE HIS TAX\nRETURNS, THEN DOESN'T IT SORT OF HURT THAT ARGUMENT TO NOT REALLY\nJUST OPEN YOURSELF UP TO THE PRESS CORPS?\n>> THIS IS WHAT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY ABOUT THIS ELECTION.\nALTHOUGH THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT ARE, WHICH IS THIS.\nSHE HAS RELEASED HER TAX RETURNS, HE HASN'T.\n>> I'M NOT SAYING HE HAS. >> ONE HAS BEHAVED IN A\nTRANSPARENT WAY WHERE IT REALLY COUNTS OF RELEASING INFORMATION\nTHAT EVERY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HAS AND ONE HAS NOT.\nSO ONE SAYS SHE'S NOT TRANSPARENT BECAUSE SHE'S CALLED\nINTO INTERVIEWS AND APPEARED IN INTERVIEWS.\nIT'S A FALSE EQUIVALENCE. IT'S A DESIRE FOR ALL OF US TO\nFIND LITTLE THINGS TO NITPICK AT AND KEEP IT ON CRITIQUES INSTEAD\nOF THE FOCUS OF THE ELECTION. >> AMY, TO YOU.\nDONALD TRUMP'S LAST PRESS CONFERENCE, I BELIEVE, WAS IN\nLATE JULY SO HE'S HAD ONE MUCH MORE RECENTLY, BUT AT THE SAME\nTIME HE HASN'T BEEN ON CNN IN MONTHS TO DO AN INTERVIEW.\nSO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT TRANSPARENCY, AND IF YOU'RE\nGOING TO HATE CLINTON FOR NOT HAVING THESE PRESS CONFERENCES,\nSHOULD WE BE SEEING MORE INTERVIEWS FROM DONALD TRUMP\nWITH ALL THE NETWORKS? >> WELL, POPPY, HE'S PUT HIMSELF\nOUT THERE, AND I BELIEVE AT THE END OF JULY HE DID THREE PRESS\nCONFERENCES IN ONE DAY IN THREE DIFFERENT STATES.\nHE IS DEFINITELY AVAILABLE AND PUT HIMSELF OUT THERE.\nI CAN'T SPEAK TO HIS SCHEDULE AND WHAT NETWORKS HE'S GOING ON,\nSO I CAN'T COMMENT ON THAT. BUT I DO THINK THERE IS A CLEAR\nDIFFERENCE HERE. THE LAST TIME THAT A\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WAITED THIS LONG TO HOLD A PRESS\nCONFERENCE HAS BEEN 44 YEARS. AL GORE, I BELIEVE, THE LONGEST\nHE WENT WAS 61 DAYS. BUT TO GO 260 DAYS, IT'S JUST\nUNHEARD OF. AND IT'S NOT JUST THE PRESS THAT\nHAS QUESTIONS, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONS.\nTHEY WANT TO HEAR THESE CANDIDATES TALK TO THEM AND\nANSWER QUESTIONS, AND SO I THINK THAT SHE DEFINITELY SHOULD HAVE\nA PRESS CONFERENCE. >> LET'S GET TO SOME OF THE\nANNOUNCEMENTS THAT CAME THIS WEEK, SALLY.\nAT THE END OF THE WEEK, WE LEARNED THE CLINTON FOUNDATION\nWILL STOP TAKING CORPORATE DONATIONS IF HILLARY CLINTON\nWINS THE ELECTION. BILL CLINTON HAS ALREADY STOPPED\nGIVING SPEECHES. DANA BASH IMPRESSED ON HIM WHY\nWAIT TO STOP TAKING THOSE DONATIONS UNTIL YOU SEE IF SHE\nWINS? YOU KNOW, IF THERE IS AN ISSUE\nWITH THEM, WHY NOT STOP WHILE SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE?\nWHY NOT STOP NOW? WHAT DO YOU THINK, SALLY?\n>> I MEAN, LOOK, I'M NOT SURE WE CAN COVER THIS IN A SHORT\nSEGMENT, BUT SOME OF THE DONATIONS MAKE ME VERY\nUNCOMFORTABLE, SUCH AS THE DONATIONS FROM SAUDI ARABIA, BUT\nTHE UNITED STATES' RELATIONSHIP WITH SAUDI ARABIA MAKES ME\nUNCOMFORTABLE. I'VE WORKED IN PHILANTHROPY,\nI'VE WORKED IN NON-PROFITS, I'VE F\nFUNDRAISED FROM DONATIONS WHOSE FUND RELIEF I'VE FOUND\nERRONEOUS. THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION'S ARGUMENT. THEY'RE TAKING WHAT MAY BE\nCONSIDERED BAD MONEY AND THEY'RE USING IT TO HELP POOR KIDS WHO\nARE DYING FROM DISEASE AND FAMINE.\nMEANWHILE, DONALD TRUMP HAS TAKEN FOREIGN INVESTMENTS FROM\nRUSSIA AND HE'S JUST USED IT TO BUILD GOLF COURSES AND LINE HIS\nOWN POCKET. SO, YOU KNOW, I THINK THIS\nCONTINUES TO BE MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING.\n>> DONALD TRUMP WAS ALSO NOT AN EMPLOYEE OF THE TAXPAYER, AND\nHILLARY CLINTON TAKING THIS FOREIGN MONEY THROUGH THE\nFOUNDATION WHEN SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE, I MEAN,\nTHERE IS A DIRECT CONFLICT OF INTEREST.\nPOPPY, I WOULD TAKE IT A STEP FURTHER AND SAY, YOU KNOW, WHY\nDON'T THEY STOP ACCEPTING THE DONATIONS.\nI THINK THEY SHOULD RETURN THE MONEY TO FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND\nFOREIGN CORPORATIONS THAT THEY'VE ALREADY ACCEPTED.\nIT'S A CLEAR CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND THEY ADMITTED THAT\nWITH THEIR STATEMENT THIS WEEK. >> AMY, SALLY, IT'S ALL THE TIME\nWE HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nIT'S NICE TO HAVE YOU BOTH ON.",

HERE IS CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN\nMANAGER ROBBIE MOOK WHO SPOKE WITH CNN'S DANA BASH THIS\nMORNING. >> WHAT THE FOUNDATION DID WAS\nUNPRECEDENTED, AS I SAID, AND WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO IS\nGOING TO BE UNPRECEDENTED AS WELL.\nYOU TALK ABOUT TRANSPARENCY, DONALD TRUMP HAS RELEASED HIS\nTAXES. DONALD TRUMP HAS RELEASED A\nSERIOUS HEALTH LETTER YET. DONALD TRUMP REFUSES TO DISCLOSE\nTHE FULL ARCHITECTURE OF HIS FINANCIAL DEBTS AND OBLIGATIONS\nAROUND THE WORLD. WE JUST READ YESTERDAY IN \"THE\nNEW YORK TIMES\" THAT HE IS A DEBTOR TO THE BANK OF CHINA.\n>> ROBBY I ASKED ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON, NOT DONALD TRUMP.\nWE'RE GOING TO TALK LATER ABOUT THAT.\n>> WELL, BUT MY POINT IS THERE'S ALL THIS SCRUTINY BECAUSE\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN TRANSPARENT.\nYOU DON'T HEAR THESE QUESTIONS WHEN MEMBERS OF THE BUSH FAMILY\nCONTINUE TO SERVE ON BOARDS FOR THE FIRST PRESIDENT BUSH'S\nFOUNDATION. SO AS I SAID, THE FOUNDATION IS\nTAKING UNPRECEDENTED STEPS HERE. WE'RE VERY PROUD THAT THEY'RE\nDOING THAT, BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE HILLARY\nCLINTON BECOMES PRESIDENT AND LETTING THE FOUNDATION DO THE\nRETOOLING THAT THEY NEED TO DO. >> ALL RIGHT.\nLET'S TALK MORE ABOUT THAT WITH CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST RON\nBROWNSTEIN, A SENIOR EDITIOR FO \"THE ATLANTIC\" AND JAY NEWTON\nSMALLS. IS IT OKAY FOR THE FOUNDATION TO\nCONTINUE TO RECEIVE THIS MONEY UNTIL NOVEMBER?\n>> LOOK, IT'S A REAL QUESTION. THIS IS SUCH UNCHARTED WATERS.\nI MEAN, THAT IS THE ISSUE. THERE'S NO QUESTION THE\nFOUNDATION HAS DONE A LOT OF GOOD WORK OVER THE YEARS ON\nISSUES LIKE AIDS, DRUGS AND AFRICA, IT'S WORKED A LOT WITH\nREPUBLICAN. BUT A UNIQUE SITUATION FROM THE\nBEGINNING THAT'S GOTTEN MORE UNIQUE AND UNPRECEDENTED AS IT'S\nGONE. I DON'T THINK WE'VE EVER HAD A\nFORMER PRESIDENT WHO HAS BUILT AN INSTITUTION OF THIS MAGNITUDE\nTO DEAL WITH AS MANY ISSUES AS PRESIDENT CLINTON HAS DONE\nACTIVATING HIS GLOBAL NETWORK IN THIS WAY AND THEN TO HAVE ON TOP\nOF THAT HIS SPOUSE BECOME FIRST SECRETARY OF STATE, THEN THE\nDEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE, IT REALLY DOES KIND OF CHANGE\nTHE LANDSCAPE. AND I THINK THEY DO NEED TO LOOK\nVERY CAREFULLY AT THIS. BECAUSE MARTIN, I THINK ONE OF\nTHE BIG LESSONS OF ALL THE REVELATIONS WE'VE HAD OVER THE\nPAST MANY MONTHS IS THAT THERE WAS NOT A FULL SENSE OF PROPER\nGUARDRAILS BETWEEN ALL OF THE CLINTON INK AND HILLARY\nCLINTON'S KIND OF RENEWED PUBLIC SERVICE CAREER.\nAND IT IS SOMETHING THAT IF SHE'S ELECTED PRESIDENT, THEY'RE\nGOING TO HAVE TO BE MUCH MORE DILIGENT AND MUCH MORE FOCUSED\nABOUT SEPARATING AND THEY'RE GOING TO NEED SOME VOICES AROUND\nHER WHO ARE MORE ATTUNE TO THIS THAN THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND\nHER IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. >> JAY, EVEN WITHOUT FOREIGN\nMONEY, DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION HAS THE\nPOTENTIAL TO BE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST?\nDOES IT REMAIN A CONFLICT OF INTEREST IF BILL AND HILLARY\nTAKE, YOU KNOW, A HIATUS FROM LEADERSHIP AND, SAY, GIVE IT TO\nCHELSEA? IS IT STILL A PROBLEM?\n>> KEEP IN MINE, THIS IS A CHARITY HERE.\nIT IS NOT LIKE THIS MONEY IS GOING TO THEM PERSONALLY.\n>> RIGHT. >> THE MONEY IS ACTUALLY GOING\nTO BUILD, YOU KNOW, PROGRAMS IN THESE COUNTRIES THAT ARE FOR THE\nBETTERMENT OF THESE PEOPLE. SO WHAT I ALWAYS THINK IS REALLY\nINTERESTING HERE IS WOULD YOU PREFER THAT THESE COUNTRIES NOT\nINVEST IN THEIR OWN DEVELOPMENT? WOULD YOU PREFER THAT IT WAS\nJUST SORT OF MONEY GIVEN, DONATED BY AMERICANS OR DONATED\nBY FIRST WORLD COUNTRIES THAT IS THEN USED TO SORT OF DEVELOP\nTHEM? I MEAN, THAT SORT OF ALSO GOES\nAGAINST -- THEY WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT.\nTHEY WANT TO HAVE A SAY IN HOW THEY'RE DEVELOPED AND THAT'S WHY\nTHEY GIVE MONEY TO THESE PROJECTS.\n>> BUT IT'S THE PERCEPTION HERE. AND WE ALL AGREE IT DOES GOOD.\nIT'S THE PERCEPTION OF A PRESIDENT THAT SOMEHOW -- YOU\nDON'T EVEN WANT TO IMPLY THAT THEY COULD BE INFLUENCED BY A\nDONATION. >> MARTIN, I'M CLOSER TO THE\nIMPLICATION OF YOUR QUESTION, WHICH IS IF HILLARY CLINTON IS\nTHE PRESIDENT, BILL CLINTON IS GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT ADVISER\nWHETHER WITH A FORMAL ROLE OR NOT, HE WILL LITERALLY BE\nWHISPERING IN THE EAR OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nIT MAKES SENSE WHERE TO MAINTAIN THE OPERATION OF THIS FOUNDATION\nIF SHE IS PRESIDENT DURING HER PRESIDENCY.\nTHERE'S NO WAY TO COMPLETELY INSULATE, DESPITE THE GOOD WORK\nTHAT IT DOES, IT DOES PROVIDE KIND OF AN ALTERNATIVE MEANS FOR\nINTEREST NOT ONLY DOMESTICALLY BUT AROUND THE WORLD.\nSO TOO REACH SOMEONE THAT WILL BE WITHIN REACH OF THE\nPRESIDENT. I WOULD IMAGINE -- I'VE GOT TO\nTHINK THAT WHOEVER IS THE CHIEF OF STAFF IN THE WHITE HOUSE WILL\nLOOK VERY HARD AND ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS IF HILLARY CLINTON\nWINS ABOUT WHETHER IT MAKES SENSE TO MAINTAIN THIS\nORGANIZATION. >> AND YOU KNOW, JAY, I'M\nTHINKING THAT FOR ESPECIALLY THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, THEY COULD USE\nTHIS. THIS IS LEVERAGE OBVIOUSLY\nAGAINST HILLARY CLINTON HERE. >> ABSOLUTELY.\n>> AND ONCE AGAIN SEEMS TO REINFORCE A PUBLIC FEELING,\nRIGHT OR WRONG, THAT THE RULES DON'T APPLY THE SAME WAY TO\nHILLARY CLINTON, THE CLINTONS IN GENERAL.\n>> ABSOLUTELY, MARTIN. LOOK, DONALD TRUMP JUST SENT OUT\nA PRESS RELEASE AN HOUR OR AN HOUR AND A HALF AGO CALLING ON\nTHE CLINTONS TO SUSPEND THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nHE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE. THERE HAVE BEEN CALLS ON THE\nHUFFINGTON POST FROM THE LEFT AND FROM THE RIGHT SAYING THAT\nIT'S A MAJOR CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND THEY SHOW JUST SHUT\nIT DOWN FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES EVEN IF SHE WINS THE\nELECTION, EVEN BEFORE THEN, SUSPEND IT RIGHT NOW.\n>> SHUT IT DOWN COMPLETELY OR IS THERE NOT SOME WAY THIS COULD BE\nHANDLED? BECAUSE IT DOES DO A LOT OF\nGOOD. >> WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE PAST\nIS POLITICIANS, MICHAEL BLOOMBERG, WHEN HE BECAME MAYOR\nOF NEW YORK, HE SEPARATED HIMSELF FROM THE PHILANTHROPIES\nTHAT HE WORKED WITH AND THEY CONTINUED ONWARDS.\nIT BECAME A BLIND TRUST. SO IF YOU TREAT THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION LIKE A COMPANY AND YOU ENTRUST SOMEBODY WHO YOU\nREALLY CLOSE FRIEND OR A CLOSE COLLEAGUE, SOMEBODY YOU REALLY\nTRUST WITH THE RUNNING OF IT, I MEAN, THAT SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD\nBE A GOOD SOLUTION. IT CONTINUES TO DO GOOD WORK AND\nSEPARATE FROM THE -- >> WE'VE GOT DONALD TRUMP WHO\nHAS GOT THIS PROBLEM. >> YEAH.\n>> ALL OF THOSE INVESTMENTS THAT NOW ARE NOT GOING TO BE A BLIND\nTRUST. WE UNDERSTAND IT WILL BE, WHAT,\nHANDLED BY FAMILY MEMBERS? >> LOOK, IT IS VERY HARD.\nIT'S AN INTERESTING IDEA THAT YOU COULD HANDLE A PHILANTHROPY\nLIKE A BLIND TRUST, LIKE A COMPANY LIKE YOUR INVESTMENTS.\nAND I THINK FOR BOTH OF THESE CANDIDATES HAVE ENORMOUSLY\nCOMPLICATED FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIPS, BUT TO GET BACK\nTO CLINTON FOR ONE MOMENT, I THINK THAT IF YOU LOOK MORE\nBROADLY AT ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT SHE'S BEEN DEALING WITH IN\nTHE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AS A CANDIDATE, ALL THE SPILLOVER\nFROM THE E-MAILS NOW FROM THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, TO ME WHAT\nIT SAYS IS YOU NEED A STRONG INDEPENDENT VOICE AROUND HER\nTHAT IS A CLEAR SENSE OF KIND OF WHAT THE GUARDRAILS NEED TO BE.\nBILL CLINTON IS AN EXTRAORDINARY HUMAN BEING WHO HAS AN\nEXTRAORDINARY NETWORK GLOBALLY. HE'S A TRUE GLOBAL CITIZEN AND\nHE'S REALLY KIND OF UNMATCHED IN THAT WAY.\nHE HAS TRIED TO LEVERAGE THAT TO ADVANCE THE CAUSES THAT HE CARES\nABOUT, BUT IF ONE OF THE CAUSES HE CARES ABOUT IS THE POTENTIAL\nPRESIDENCY OF HIS WIFE IT MAKES SENSE TO HAVE STRONGER\nBOUNDARIES BETWEEN WHAT HE HAS BEEN DOING AND HIS PUBLIC\nSERVICE THAN THEY HAVE PUT TOGETHER SO FAR.\nI THINK THAT IS GOING TO BE ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT KIND OF\nCOMPLEX JOBS FOR THE NEXT -- IF SHE IS PRESIDENT, THE NEXT CHIEF\nOF STAFF. >> RON, I'M SORRY, I HAVE TO\nWRAP IT THERE ONLY BECAUSE WE'RE ONLY JUST ABOUT OUT OF TIME.\nAND JAY NEWTON SMALL, THANK YOU.

LOOK, WHAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON\nRIGHT NOW IS MAKING SURE HILLARY CLINTON IS ELECTED PRESIDENT, SO\nNOBODY WANTS TO GET AHEAD OF THEMSELVES.\nBUT WE'RE GLAD TO HEAR THAT THEY HAVE ONCE AGAIN TAKEN AN\nUNPRECEDENTED STEP IN TERMS OF TRANSPARENCY AND RULES.\n>> ROBBY, I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND THIS.\nPART OF THE ISSUE WITH A LOT OF VOTERS KEEPING HER FROM BEING\nPRESIDENT, KEEPING VOTERS FROM GOING INTO THE BOOTH AND VOTING\nFOR HER, IS THEY THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF\nQUESTIONS ABOUT THE INTEGRITY OR HONESTY OF HER EXPERIENCE IN\nPOLITICS AND THAT THIS IS ONE OF THEM.\nSO, CONSIDERING THAT, WHY NOT, IF YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS\nSTEP, DO NOW TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THERE IS NO ISSUE HERE WITH HER\nACCEPTING FOREIGN DONATIONS OR OTHERS FROM PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE\nTRYING TO AFFECT HER AND TRYING TO GET AROUND GIVING IT TO THE\nCAMPAIGN THE WAY ANYBODY ELSE WOULD IS.\n>> WHAT THE FOUNDATION DID WAS UNPRECEDENTED AS I SAID, WHAT\nTHEY'RE GOING TO DO IS UNPRECEDENTED AS WELL.\nTALK ABOUT TRANSPARENCY. DONALD TRUMP HASN'T RELEASED HIS\nTAXES. DONALD TRUMP HASN'T RELEASED A\nSERIOUS HEALTH LETTER YET. DONALD TRUMP REFUSES TO DISCLOSE\nTHE FULL ARCHITECTURE OF HIS FINANCIAL DEBTS AND OBLIGATIONS\nAROUND THE WORLD. WE JUST READ YESTERDAY IN THE\n\"NEW YORK TIMES\" THAT HE IS A DEBTOR TO THE BANK OF CHINA.\nNO ONE HAD DISCLOSED THIS. >> I ASKED ABOUT HILLARY\nCLINTON, NOT DONALD TRUMP. WE'LL TALK LATER ABOUT THAT.\n>> WELL -- BUT MY POINT IS THAT THERE IS ALL THIS SCRUTINY\nBECAUSE SHE HAS BEEN TRANSPARENT.\nI DON'T THINK YOU HEARD THESE QUESTIONS WHEN MEMBERS OF THE\nBUSH FAMILY CONTINUED TO SERVE ON BOARDS FOR THE FIRST\nPRESIDENT BUSH'S FOUNDATION. SO, AS I SAID, THE FOUNDATION IS\nTAKING UNPRECEDENTED STEPS HERE. WE'RE VERY PROUD THAT THEY'RE\nDOING THAT. BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE FOCUSED ON\nMAKING SURE HILLARY CLINTON BECOMES PRESIDENT AND LETTING\nTHE FOUNDATION DO THE RETOOLING THAT THEY NEED TO DO.\n>> A NEW BATCH OF STATE DEPARTMENT E-MAILS WERE RELEASED\nLAST WEEK SHOWING DOUG BAND, A COUNSELOR TO THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION, ASKING CLINTON ADVISERS HUMO ABEDIN AND CHERYL\nMILLS, STATE DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEES AT THE TIME FOR A\nFAVOR. HE FORWARDED AN E-MAIL FROM A\nCLINTON FOUNDATION DONOR AND TOLD THEM IT WAS IMPORTANT TO\nTAKE CARE OF THE REQUEST. HUMA SAID, WE'VE ALL HAD HIM ON\nOUR RADAR. PERSONNEL HAS BEEN SENDING HIM\nOPTIONS. IS THIS THE KIND OF BACK\nSCRATCHING THAT HAS AMERICANS TURNED OFF AND DONE WITH\nPOLITICIANS WHO HAVE BEEN IN WASHINGTON FOR A LONG TIME?\n>> THE QUESTION WAS COMING FROM HIS PRIVATE E-MAIL ACCOUNT.\nOR HIS CLINTON.COM E-MAIL ACCOUNT.\nIT WAS NOT RELATED TO THE FOUNDATION.\nAND THE FOUNDATION AT EVERY STEP -- RATHER, EXCUSE ME, THE\nSTATE DEPARTMENT AT EVERY STEP WAS FOLLOWING ALL THE\nAPPROPRIATE PROTOCOLS. THIS WAS SOMEONE WHO HAD A\nRELATIONSHIP WITH THE CLINTONS LONG BEFORE HILLARY BECAME\nSECRETARY OF STATE. >> BUT ROBBY, THE ISSUE IS NOT\nSO MUCH WHERE THE E-MAIL IS COMING FROM.\nIT'S THE REQUEST IN GENERAL. WHO THE REQUEST IS GOING TO,\nRIGHT? >> WELL, AGAIN, THIS IS SOMEONE\nWHO HAD A LONG-STANDING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CLINTONS,\nWHO HAD WANTED TO PROVIDE SOME INSIGHT INTO A MATTER.\nAND OBVIOUSLY THE CLINTONS HAVE STAFF THAT FACILITATE THOSE\nSORTS OF COMMUNICATIONS. THERE WAS NO QUID PRO QUO OR\nANYTHING LIKE THAT HERE. AS I SAID, THE E-MAIL ORIGINATED\nFROM PRESIDENT CLINTON'S PRIVATE OFFICE.\n>> A FEDERAL JUDGE ON FRIDAY ORDERED HILLARY CLINTON TO\nPROVIDE WRITTEN TESTIMONY ABOUT HER PRIVATE SERVER.\nYOU'LL GET THE QUESTIONS BY OCTOBER 14th, AND YOU'RE GOING\nTO HAVE 30 DAYS TO ANSWER THEM. THEORETICALLY, YOU WON'T HAVE TO\nANSWER THE QUESTIONS UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION.\nYOU WERE TALKING ABOUT TRANSPARENCY AND HOW TRANSPARENT\nSECRETARY CLINTON HAS BEEN. GIVEN THAT, IN THE NAME OF\nTRANSPARENCY, WILL SHE WORK TO PRODUCE THOSE ANSWERS AND MAKE\nTHEM PUBLIC BEFORE THE ELECTION ON NOVEMBER 8th?\n>> WELL, AS YOU MENTIONED, THE JUDGE HAS SET A DEADLINE WHEREBY\nTHE GROUP IN QUESTION NEEDS TO SUBMIT THOSE.\nAND WHEN THEY'RE RECEIVED, I KNOW THE SECRETARY WILL GET TO\nWORK RIGHT AWAY ON ANSWERING THEM.\nBUT LET'S STEP BACK AND LOOK AT THE ORIGIN OF ALL OF THIS.\nTHE RIGHT WING AND REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS ARE NOT SATISFIED\nWITH THE ANSWER THAT THE CAREER PROFESSIONALS AT THE FBI AND\nJUSTICE DEPARTMENT GAVE. THEY SAID THERE WAS NO CASE\nHERE. THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A\nRIGHT-WING GROUP TRYING TO KEEP THE QUESTIONS COMING AND KEEP\nTHIS ISSUE ALIVE. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE ALL THE\nINFORMATION. THE E-MAILS HAVE BEEN RELEASED.\nTHEY HAVE ENOUGH TO MAKE A JUDGMENT AT THIS POINT.\nWE AT THE CAMPAIGN JUST WANT TO MOVE ON AND TALK ABOUT THE\nISSUES THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT IN THIS ELECTION, LIKE\nJOBS, COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY AND HEALTH CARE.\n>> THAT SOUNDS LIKE A NO. >> AS I SAID, AS SOON AS SHE\nRECEIVES THE QUESTION, IF THE JUDGE ASKS HER TO ANSWER THOSE\nQUESTIONS, SHE'LL GET TO WORK RIGHT AWAY ON GETTING THE\nQUESTIONS ANSWERED. >> YOU'RE FACING AN INCREDIBLY\nDELICATE TASK, LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY TO PLAY DONALD TRUMP IN\nMOCK DEBATES FOR HILLARY CLINTON'S DEBATE PREP.\nSOMEBODY WHO IS GOING TO BRING UP SOME TOPICS THAT YOUR\nCANDIDATE PROBABLY WOULD RATHER FORGET.\nHAVE YOU SETTLED ON THAT PERSON? >> WELL, WE HAVEN'T YET.\nIT'S VERY HARD TO FIND SOMEONE TO MIMIC THE RECKLESS\nTEMPERAMENT AND THE HATEFUL INSTINCTS AND DIVISIVE INSTINCTS\nOF DONALD TRUMP. PREPARING FOR A DEBATE WITH HIM\nIS A CHALLENGING TASK BUT SECRETARY CLINTON IS LOOKING\nFORWARD TO THE DEBATE. I THINK YOU'LL SEE A REAL\nDIFFERENCE BETWEEN STEADY LEADERSHIP AND A VERY RECKLESS\nTEMPERAMENT. >> IS IT THAT OR FINDING SOMEONE\nWHO KNOWS HILLARY CLINTON WELL AND IS WILLING TO SAY SOME\nPRETTY TOUGH THINGS TO HER? >> SHE HAS BEEN IN THIS GAME A\nLONG TIME AND HAD A LOT OF TOUGH THINGS SAID TO HER.\nTHAT'S NOT THE CHALLENGE HERE. THE CHALLENGE IS FINDING SOMEONE\nWHO CAN RECREATE THE KIND OF RECKLESS TEMPERAMENT, THE KIND\nOF HATEFUL LANGUAGE AND DIVISIVE LANGUAGE THAT'S BECOME TRUMP'S\nHALLMARK. WE'LL GET IT DONE.\nWE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE DEBATES.\n>> ROBBY MOOK. THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME.\n>> THANKS.",

THE TIMING, MORE THAN A LITTLE\nCURIOUS. DONALD TRUMP OF LATE HAS BEEN\nMUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE IN QUESTIONING CLINTON'S ETHICS.\n>> WHILE OUR COUNTRY LOST BADLY UNDER HILLARY CLINTON, SHE\nCASHED IN BIG-TIME. THERE WAS ALL THE MONEY FUNNELED\nINTO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION FROM FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND\nCORPORATIONS. IT WAS PAY FOR PLAY.\nIN A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, THE STATE DEPARTMENT WILL WORK FOR\nTHE COUNTRY, NOT FOR HILLARY CLINTON'S DONORS.\n>> IT'S NOT JUST THE CANDIDATE. THE NEW CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN COMES FROM A CONSERVATIVE WEBSITE WHICH HAS\nLONG ACCUSED THE CLINTONS OF CORRUPTION.\n>> A NEW REPORT TODAY CLAIMS THE CLINTON FOUNDATION GIVES ABOUT\n10% OF ITS MONEY THAT IT RAISES TO ACTUAL CHARITIES.\n>> ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY HAVE FLOWED TO THE CLINTONS FROM\nFOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, FOREIGN FINANCIERS AND BUSINESSES.\n>> NOW, THIS CHANGE, IF SHE BECOMES PRESIDENT, AND THERE ARE\nALREADY PEOPLE SEEING LOOPHOLES IN THE CHANGE, BUT -- SURPRISE,\nYEAH -- WE WON'T TAKE FOREIGN MONEY, WON'T TAKE CORPORATION\nMONEY. BILL CLINTON WON'T GIVE PAID\nSPEECHES. HE IS NOT GIVING ANY RIGHT NOW.\nCO THE BOSTON GLOBE SAID A WEEK AGO\nSHE SHOULD SHUT IT DOWN THEY SAY WHY DIDN'T IT POSE A PROBLEM AS\nSECRETARY OF STATE. THE ANSWER IS IT DID AND DOES\nAND THEY KNOW IT. >> THE CLINTONS WILL GET AWAY\nWITH WHATEVER THEY CAN FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.\nIT VIOLATE THE SPIRIT OF ETHICAL AGREEMENTS OR LAWS.\nTHIS IS HOW THEY DO BUSINESS. TRUMP AND SHE ARE FIGHTING ON\nEQUALLY UNLIKABLE UNPOPULAR GROUNDS HERE.\nTHIS IS ANOTHER THING WHERE, HAD SHE DONE IT SIX MONTHS AGO, THE\nSTORY WOULD BE DIFFERENT NOW.

THAT WILL BE A WEAKNESS FOR HER.\n>> THIS WILL BE AN INTERESTING DEBATE.\nWHETHER TRUMP CAN CARRY THIS IN THE DEBATE OR WHETHER SHE TURNS\nTHE TRUMP INDUSTRIES AND FINANCES --\n>> HE HAS A CLEANER ARGUMENT NOW THAT MANAFORT IS NO LONGER WITH\nTHE CAMPAIGN. HE WAS A BIT OF A LIABILITY\nBECAUSE OF HIS OVERSEAS DEALINGS AS WELL.\nI THINK THIS IS A POWERFUL ARGUMENT THAT THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN -- THAT TRUMP HIMSELF CAN MAKE.\nIT'S SORT OF -- EITHER REAL CORRUPTION OR THE SPECTER OF\nCORRUPTION. A WHIFF OF PAY FOR PLAY.\n>> CAN YOU EXPECT THIS WOMAN TO CHANGE WASHINGTON.\n>> WE DID AN ANALYSIS OVER THE WEEKEND THAT FOUND HALF OF THE\nMONEY WOULD HAVE FALLEN UNDER THE RULES THAT ARE NOW BANNED\nFOR DONATION. IT'S A REAL THING FOR THEM THAT\nGOING BACK TO HER STATE DEPARTMENT YEARS, SHE WAS -- HER\nFAMILY FOUNDATION WAS ACCEPTING MONEY FROM FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS\nAND ENTITIES IN WAYS THAT THEY ARE ACKNOWLEDGING IS BASICALLY\nUNETHICAL -- OR WOULD BE UNETHICAL COME NOVEMBER.\n>> THEIR BIG GATHERING IS THIS FALL.\nSO IT WILL COME UP AGAIN. >> THE FACT THAT SHE WAS DOING\nTHIS WHILE SECRETARY OF STATE, TAKING I MEAN BIG MONEY FROM THE\nSAUDIS, FOR EXAMPLE. WHERE ARE THE ADS?\nIT'S ONE MORE EXAMPLE OF JUST -- IF YOU HAD A FUNCTIONAL\nOPPOSITION, CAN YOU IMAGINE THE KIND OF ATTACKS THAT COULD BE\nLAUNCHED? NOW AT ALMOST LABOR DAY TO SAY,\nIF SHE IS PRESIDENT WE'LL SHUT IT DOWN.\nIT'S SUCH EASY FODDER. ONE FAST POINT.\nTHIS IS PART OF HER CHALLENGE WITH YOUNGER VOTERS.\nTHIS IS PART OF THE REASON WHY SHE WAS VULNERABLE AGAINST\nBERNIE. NOT BECAUSE OF IDEALOGICAL\nISSUES BUT THE SPECTER AND UNSEEMLINESS OF SOME OF THEIR\nFINANCIAL DEALINGS. IT SEEMS SO CYNICAL.\nTHIS IS PART OF HER CHALLENGE. TRUMP HAS BEEN A GIFT, BUT THIS\nIS PART OF HER CHALLENGE, WINNING OVER YOUNGER, MORE\nIDEALISTIC VOTERS. >> YOU HAVE JUDICIAL WATCH ABOUT\nTRYING TO GET THE E-MAILS OUT. IT FILES A LOT OF SUITS TO GET\nGOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS. IF YOU ARE A FAN OF\nTRANSPARENCY, YOU SHOULD SUPPORT THAT ASPECT.\nA JUDGE HAS SAID THEY WANT TO DEPOSE HER.\nTHE JUDGE SAID NO. YOU DON'T GET A DEPOSITION IN\nPERSON BUT SHE'LL ANSWER WRITTEN QUESTIONS.\nWE SAW REPORTS THIS WEEK THAT IN HER FBI INTERVIEW SHE SAID, I\nHAD THE PERSONAL E-MAIL ACCOUNT BECAUSE COLIN POWELL TOLD ME\nTHAT'S THE WAY TO DO THINGS. IS THERE A POSSIBILITY -- SHE\nAND HER LAWYERS WILL ANSWER THE QUESTIONS FROM JUDICIAL WATCH.\nI ASSUME THEY'LL BE EXTRA CAREFUL BUT IT STILL RAISES THE\nPER POSSIBILITY THAT WE'RE NOT DONE\nHERE. >> MOST PEOPLE IN THE POLLS\nTHINK SOMETHING UNETHICAL HAPPENED.\nBUT THEY ALSO SUGGEST PEOPLE ARE SICK OF HEARING ABOUT HER\nE-MAILS. THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS VOTING\nON THE LATTER, THEY HAVE TO BE WORRIED ABOUT THE DRIP, DRIP,\nDRIP OF THIS AND IF THEY CAN ESSENTIALLY START TO LOSE THIS\nTHING SORT OF A DEATH BY A THOUSAND CUTS.\n>> EVEN WHILE VOTERS ARE MAYBE SICK OF THE SORT OF ATMOSPHERE\nOF TALKING ABOUT THESE E-MAILS AND THE CONTROVERSY, EVERY TIME\nTHAT SOMETHING COMES OUT THAT'S CONCRETE LIKE THESE MOST RECENT\nE-MAILS THAT REVEALED THINGS ABOUT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION OR\nWHATEVER WE MAY HEAR FROM HER FBI INTERVIEWS OR FROM THE\nDEPOSITIONS TO COME, IT GIVES MORE CONCRETE FODDER FOR VOTERS\nTO LATCH ONTO.

CLINTON HAVE A CHANCE TO CLARIFY\nTHIS BEFORE THE ELECTION? >> I THINK SHE'S GOING TO FULLY\nCOOPERATE AND SHE'S PLEASED IT COULD BE DONE BY QUESTIONING\nRATHER THAN LIVE QUESTIONING. SO THIS HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE.\nMR. COMEY HAS ALREADY MADE HIS FINDINGS THAT THERE'S NO\nCRIMINAL INVOLVEMENT HERE.

BUT THEY ALSO INDICATE THAT\nTHERE'S SUPPOSEDLY SENSITIVE INFORMATION BY FORMER\nSECRETARIES OF STATE THAT WERE USED IN THAT CONTEXT.\nSO THIS IS NOT UNIQUE. AND QUITE FRANKLY, SENATOR\nCORKER AND I WANT TO LOOK AT THIS AFTER THE ELECTION TO SEE\nTHE BEST WAY WE CAN USE ELECTRONIC TRANSFER OF\nINFORMATION BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT.\nTHIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO DEAL WITH.\nBUT AS FAR AS WHAT'S BEING DONE NOW, LOOK, THIS LAWSUIT IS BEING\nDONE BY A GROUP THAT SINCE THE 1990s HAS BEEN A RIGHT WING\nPARTISAN GROUP ATTACKING HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHIS IS A PARTISAN ATTACK. AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT'S USED\nTO TRY TO DISTRACT FROM THE IMPORTANT ISSUES OF THIS\nCAMPAIGN, THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY\nCLINTON. >> AND THEY HAVE, JUDICIAL\nWATCH, MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THEY ARE VERY DOGGED ABOUT GOING\nAFTER THESE E-MAILS. IN THE MEANTIME, THE GOP LEADERS\nOF THE HOUSE JUDICIARY AND OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES ARE PUSHING\nFOR A PERJURY INVESTIGATION TAKING DIRECTOR COMEY'S -- HIS\nOWN STATEMENTS AND PUTTING THEM UP AGAINST MRS. CLINTON'S\nSTATEMENTS SAYING THERE ARE SOME DISCREPANCIES THERE.\nTHEY'VE ASKED THE U.S. ATTORNEY THERE IN WASHINGTON TO TAKE A\nLOOK AT THAT. DO YOU THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\nCAN BE CONVINCED THERE WILL BE AN OPEN AND TRANSPARENT\nPOTENTIAL INVESTIGATION INTO THAT ISSUE?\n>> LOOK, I THINK WHAT IS BEING REQUESTED BY MY CONGRESSIONAL\nCOLLEAGUES IS STRICTLY A PARTISAN WITCH HUNT.\nI WISH THEY SHOWED THE SAME DEGREE OF INTEREST IN PAUL\nMANAFORT'S CONNECTIONS TO RUSSIA AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN REGARDS\nTO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND THE BUSINESS DEALS THAT DONALD TRUMP\nHAS HAD IN RUSSIA. IT WOULD BE NICE TO SEE THAT\nTHEY HAD SOME INTEREST AS TO WHAT RUSSIA'S INVOLVEMENT IS IN\nOUR CAMPAIGN, BUT INSTEAD THEY CONTINUE TO GO AFTER THE E-MAIL\nISSUE EVEN THOUGH, AS I SAID, FBI DIRECTOR COMEY HAS INDICATED\nTHAT THAT CASE IS CLOSED. >> HE HAS.\nTHERE WILL BE NO CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.\nHE DID RAISE A NUMBER OF CONCERNS THERE ABOUT EXTREME\nCARELESSNESS AND THE HANDLING OF CLASSIFIED MATERIAL.\nIN THE MEANTIME, WE HAD THIS POLL FROM ABC NEWS, \"WASHINGTON\nPOST,\" ABOUT WHETHER MRS. CLINTON IS HONEST AND\nTRUSTWORTHY. 38% BELIEVE SHE IS, 5 DT 9% SAY\nSHE'S NOT. >> I DON'T KNOW.\nSHE'S QUALIFIED AND SHE'S READY. AS COMPARED TO DONALD TRUMP WHO\nHAS SHOWN HIS RECKLESSNESS AND DANGEROUS STATEMENTS THAT HE'S\nMADE. HIS TEMPERAMENT TO BE COMMANDER\nIN CHIEF, HIS QUALIFICATIONS, NO, IT'S NOT THIS.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS\nBEEN ABUZZ BY SPECIAL INTEREST. AND THE CLINTON FOUNDATION WILL\nNO LONGER ACCEPT FOREIGN MONEY. THE BOSTON GLOBE SAID IT SHOW BE\nSHUT DOWN ALTOGETHER. IT CREATES A VIEW OF POTENTIAL\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST. THE INHERENT CONFLICT OF\nINTEREST IS OBVIOUS WHEN HILLARY CLINTON BECAME SECRETARY OF\nSTATE IN 2009. SHE PROMISED TO MAINTAIN A\nSEPARATION BETWEEN HER OFFICIAL WORK AND THE FOUNDATION BUT\nRECENTLY RELEASED E-MAILS BY HER STAFFERS DURING HER STATE\nDEPARTMENT TENURE MAKE CLEAR THAT THE SUPPOSED PARTITION WAS\nFAR FROM IMPREGNABLE. IF THE FOUNDATION DONORS ARE\nMOTIVATED BY ALTRUISM AND NOT BY THE LURE OF ACCESS TO THE\nCLINTONS, THEN SURELY THEY CAN FIND OTHER WAYS TO SUPPORT THE\nFOUNDATION'S GOALS. >> THE CLINTON FOUNDATION HAS\nHELPED OVER 10 MILLION HIV/AIDS ALONE, SAVED COUNTLESS LIVES.\nITS WORK IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO GLOBAL HEALTH.\nSO THEY'VE DONE SOME REALLY GREAT THINGS.\nNOW, WITH HILLARY CLINTON BEING ELECTED PRESIDENT, WHICH WE HOPE\nIT WILL BE, THEY CLEARLY NEED TO CHANGE THE WAY THEY DO BUSINESS.\nAND THEY'VE INDICATED THEY WILL. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO ACCEPT ANY\nDONATIONS FROM FOREIGN ENTITIES. THEY'RE GOING TO CHANGE THE WAY\nTHAT THE CLINTONS THEMSELVES INTERACT WITH THE FOUNDATION.\nTHOSE DECISIONS WILL BE MADE APPROPRIATE TO HILLARY CLINTON\nAS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\n>> AND WE WILL WATCH. BY THE WAY, YOU MENTION THE\nHEALTH BENEFITS AND THINGS THEY'VE WORKED ON.\nTHE CLINTON HEALTH ACCESS INITIATIVE APPARENTLY IS A PART\nOF THE FOUNDATION BUT SAYING IT'S NOT YET MADE ITS OWN\nDECISION ABOUT WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO, THAT AND ITS DONATIONS\nMAY CONTINUE AS WELL. THIS WEEK HE MADE SOME APPEALS\nTO THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY.\nI WANT TO PLAY WHAT HE SAID TUESDAY IN WISCONSIN.\n>> THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY HAS BEEN TAKEN FOR\nGRANTED FOR DECADES BY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.\nWE REJECT THE BIGOTRY OF HILLARY CLINTON, WHICH PANDERS TO AND\nTALKS DOWN TO COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND SEES THEM ONLY AS\nVOTES. >> HE TALKED ABOUT CRIME RATES\nIN MINORITY NEIGHBORHOODS, FAILING EDUCATION, HIGH\nUNEMPLOYMENT. DOES HE HAVE A POINT?\n>> NO. THERE'S A CLEAR DIFFERENCE\nBETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON ON THEIR ECONOMIC\nMETHODS WHICH IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO THE\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN MINORITY COMMUNITIES AND THAT IS HILLARY\nCLINTON'S PROGRAM WILL HELP ALL. SHE WANTS TO INVEST IN BUILDING\nOUR INFRASTRUCTURE, BUILD OUR ROADS, BUILD OUR ENERGY\nINFRAINSTRUCT. SHE WANTS TO INVEST IN PEOPLE\nTHAT FREE HIGHER EDUCATION SO ALL OF US CAN GROW.\nSHEN A RESPONSIBLE WAY BY ASKING THOSE WHO ARE\nTAKING JOBS AWAY FROM AMERICA TO PAY AN EXIT FEE AS WELL AS\nCLOSING LOOPHOLES. DONALD TRUMP IS WIDENING\nLOOPHOLES FOR THE WEALTHIEST IN THE NATION.\nTHERE'S NO COMPARISON AS TO WHICH CANDIDATE SPEAKS TO THE\nNEEDS OF THE MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES.\n>> WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THEIR ECONOMIC PLAN COMING\nUP. BUT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT\nFOREIGN POLICY. YOU'RE THE RANKING MEMBER ON THE\nSENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE.\nYOU WERE VOCALLY AND PUBLICLY OPPOSED TO THE IRAN DEAL.\nYOU FELT THERE WERE FLAWS THERE THAT YOU COULDN'T SUPPORT.\nTHERE IS NEW FALLOUT ABOUT THAT $400 MILLION PAYMENT THAT WAS\nCONVERTED INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY, GIVEN TO THE IRANIANS.\nTHIS WEEK THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS ADMITTING THAT THERE WAS SOME\nDIRECT CONNECTION WITH THE RELEASE OF AMERICANS BEING HELD\nIN IRAN ABOUT THAT. I WANT TO PLAY WHAT PRESIDENT\nOBAMA SAID AUGUST 4th AND THEN WHAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS\nSAYING THIS WEEK. >> WE DO NOT PAY RANSOM.\nWE DIDN'T HERE AND WE WON'T IN THE FUTURE PRECISELY BECAUSE IF\nWE DID, THEN WE WOULD START ENCOURAGING AMERICANS TO BE\nTARGETED. >> IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FOOLISH\nAND PRUDENT, IRRESPONSIBLE FOR ITS TO NOT MAINTAIN MAXIMUM\nLEVERAGE. SO IF YOU'RE ASKING ME WAS THERE\nA CONNECTION IN THAT REGARD AT THE ENDGAME, I'M NOT GOING TO\nDENY THAT. >> TO A LOT OF PEOPLE IT SOUNDS\nLIKE A RANSOM PAYMENT. BUT WAS IT?\n>> THIS WAS DONE AND ANNOUNCED IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR.\nSECRETARY CLINTON WAS NO LONGER SECRETARY OF STATE.\nTHIS IS UNDER SECRETARY KERRY. CLEARLY WHAT WAS DONE HERE IS WE\nPAID MONEY THAT WE OWED. WE HAD TO PAY THIS MONEY, IT WAS\nCLEAR. TO THE EXTENT THAT IT HAD\nANYTHING TO DO WITH HOSTAGES, SECRETARY KERRY MADE IT CLEAR\nTHAT THAT MONEY WOULD NOT BE RELEASED UNLESS OUR HOSTAGES\nWERE BACK HOME. NO, IT'S NOT PAYING RANSOM.\nWE WON'T DO THAT. WE UNDERSTAND WE OWED THE MONEY\nAND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY THE MONEY, BUT WE WANT TO MAKE\nSURE THAT OUR PEOPLE ARE PROTECTED.\n>> A TOP IRANIAN GENERAL SAID THIS MONEY WAS RETURNED FOR THE\nFREEDOM OF THE U.S. SPIES AND IT WAS NOT RELATED TO THE NUCLEAR\nNEGOTIATIONS. SO IF THERE'S A PERCEPTION HERE,\nREGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANYONE WANTS TO USE THE WORD \"RANSOM\"\nOR NOT, THAT THERE'S LEVERAGE IN RELEASING THE AMERICANS AND\nGETTING THE EXCHANGE, ISN'T IT A PROBLEM BECAUSE WE'VE HAD TWO\nMORE AMERICANS TAKEN BY IRANIAN AUTHORITIES SINCE THIS PAYMENT.\n>> WHATEVER THE IRANIANS SAY, YOU CAN BELIEVE JUST ABOUT\nOPPOSITE. THEY RARELY TELL US WHAT IS\nGOING ON. AMERICA HAS A VERY STRONG\nPOLICY. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS\nCARRIED OUT THAT POLICY. NO, WE WILL NOT PAY RANSOM\nBECAUSE THAT ONLY ENCOURAGES MORE TO BE TAKEN.\nSO I AGREE WITH THAT POINT. WE ARE NOT GOING TO PAY RANSOM.\nHERE WE HAD TO MAKE THIS PAYMENT.\nIT WAS A MATTER OF WHEN WE WERE GOING TO MAKE IT.\nIT WAS BEING LITIGATED IN INTERNATIONAL COURTS, MONEY THAT\nAMERICA OWED THAT PREDATES THIS IRANIAN ADMINISTRATION.\nIT WAS GOING TO HAVE TO BE PAID AND THE ADMINISTRATION MADE\nJUDGMENTS AS TO WHEN TO PAY IT. >> YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE\nPERCEPTION CAN CAUSE A PROBLEM. >> I UNDERSTAND PERCEPTION, BUT\nI UNDERSTAND IN THAT WAS WELL UNDERSTOOD AT THE TIME IN\nJANUARY. HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HILLARY\nCLINTON. SHE WAS NOT SECRETARY OF STATE\nAT THE TIME. >> NOT ASKING IN THAT CONTEXT,\nBUT JUST ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION.\nI WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT SYRIA BECAUSE THE PICTURES THE AND\nIMAGES OF THE LITTLE BOY, THE 5-YEAR-OLD BEING TAKEN OUT OF\nTHE RUBBLE AFTER THIS AIR STRIKE HIT HIS FAMILY.\nWE FOUND OUT HIS 10-YEAR-OLD BROTHER WOUND UP DIEING FROM\nTHAT AIR STRIKE. THIS CAME AFTER PRESIDENT OBAMA\nSAID IT IS TIME FOR BASHAR AL SAD STEP ASIDE.\nFIVE YEARS LATER WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS, BY ALL\nACCOUNTS, WHO ARE DEAD, WHY IS THIS EVEN WORSE THAN BEFORE, THE\nCHAOS IN SYRIA? >> PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT\nRUSSIA IS HELPING THE SYRIAN REGIME.\nTHE SYRIAN REGIME HAS COMMITTED APROSTIES.\nWE SEE THAT IN ALEPPO AND OTHER PARTS OF SYRIA.\nTHEN WE HAVE, OF COURSE, THE ISIL FORCES THAT ARE ALSO\nCAUSING THESE PROBLEMS. >> WHAT COULD WE HAVE BEEN DOING\nBETTER? >> WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS WORK\nWITH OUR INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS. THAT'S WHAT THE OBAMA\nADMINISTRATION HAS DONE. WE CAN'T POLICE THE WORLD.\nIF WE PUT OUR TROOPS THERE IT WILL BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.\nWE KNOW THAT. WE HAVE TO BUILD UP LOCAL\nCAPACITY. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE OBAMA\nADMINISTRATION HAS DONE. WE'RE REGAINING TERRITORY AT THE\nSAME TIME BUILDING THE LOCAL CAPACITY TO HOLD THAT TERRITORY.\nAND THAT WE HAVE DONE. WE HAVE TO CONTINUOUSLY DO THAT\nUNTIL THERE IS NO LONGER AN ISIS AND THE CALIPHATE IS OVER.\n>> WE ALL LOOK FORWARD TO THAT DAY.\nSENATOR BEN CARDIN, THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK.\nGOOD TO HAVE YOU ON FOX NEWS",

THEY SAID THAT JUDICIAL WATCH IS\nA RIGHT-RING ORGANIZATION THAT'S BEEN ATTACKING THE CLINTONS\nSINCE THE 1990s, WE'RE GLAD THE JUDGE HAS OFFERED HER THE CHANCE\nTO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS IN WRITING RATHER THAN GRANT\nJUDICIAL WATCH'S REQUEST, WHICH WAS A DEPOSITION TYPE THING.\nBUT THESE ARE QUESTIONS UNDER OATH AND SPECIFIC QUESTIONS\nABOUT HER SERVER. >> AND IT'S IMPORTANT.\nIT'S GOOD FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\nTHIS GETS AT A DIFFERENT QUESTION.\nWAS SHE TRYING TO HIDE HER E-MAILS, HER BUSINESS FROM\nPUBLIC SCRUTINY? BUT THERE'S AN EVEN MORE\nIMPORTANT ASPECT OF THIS. HILLARY CLINTON, LIKE HER\nHUSBAND, IS A MASTER AT PARSING WORDS TO THE POINT WHERE THEY\nHAVE MEANING, THEN USING THOSE MEANINGLESS WORDS THAT'S TO THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE. SHE WAS ON THIS SHOW AND ASKED\nBY CHRIS WALLACE ABOUT WHETHER SHE LIED TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC.\nSHE SAID THAT THE FBI DIRECTOR SAID THAT SHE'D BEEN TRUTHFUL IN\nHER RESPONSES. THE FBI DIRECTOR WAS TALKING\nABOUT HER RESPONSES TO THE FBI NOT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC.\nKIND OF A FUNCTIONAL EQUIVALENT THAT IT DEPENDS WHAT YOUR\nDEFINITION OF THE WORD \"IS\" IS. THEY'VE GIVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\nTHE OPPORTUNITY TO GET MORE ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS AND\nFORCE THIS CONVERSATION INTO THE PUBLIC.\nJUDICIAL WATCH HAS DONE A GREAT JOB ON THE ISSUE.\n>> WE'LL SEE ON THE TIMING OF THIS, BECAUSE SHE HAS 30 DAYS TO\nANSWER THE QUESTIONS ONCE THEY GET TO HER.\nWE EXPECT JUDICIAL WATCH WILL GET THEM OUT PROMPTLY BECAUSE\nTHEY WANT THESE BEFORE NOVEMBER 8th.\nBUT LISTEN, HER TEAM AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT IN MANY OF\nTHESE PRIVATE CASES THEY FILED FOR LENGTHY DELAYS.\nTHERE'S ONE THAT'S SPENDING INTO OCTOBER OF 2018.\nDO THEY TRY TO PUSH THIS PAST THE ELECTION, WILL THEY BE\nSUCCESSFUL? >> I THINK THEY WOULD BE SMART\nTO NOT PUSH IT PAST THE ELECTION BECAUSE IT WOULD LOOK TO BLATANT\nAT THIS POINT. THEY'VE MADE A BIG DEAL ABOUT\nWANTING TO ASK QUESTIONS AND THE PUBLIC WANTING THE ANSWERS.\nTHEY CAN DO THESE WRITTEN ANSWERS WHICH OBVIOUSLY GIVES\nTHEM MORE CONTROL THAN IF SHE WAS IN A DEPOSITION THAT WOULD\nBE PUSHED IN REALTIME. IF THEY DID PUSH FOR A DELAY, IT\nWOULD BE VERY FAIR TORE REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS TO\nCRITICIZE THEM FOR THAT. >> WE'LL SEE HOW QUICKLY THOSE\nQUESTIONS GET TO HER, BECAUSE THAT'S KEY.\nFROM FACEBOOK, A QUESTION FROM ANNETTE.\nI WOULD LIKE TO KNOW AS A STANDARD FOR JUSTICE IS THE\nVICTIM FOR AVERAGE AMERICANS AS IT IS FOR HILLARY?\n>> FAIR QUESTION. YOU KNOW, JUST LAST WEEK WE SAW\nWHERE A NAVY S.E.A.L. WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THE USAMA BIN LADEN\nRAID AND WROTE A BOOK ABOUT IT \"NO EASY DAY\" WAS FORCED TO HAND\nOVER ALL THE PROCEEDS, $6 MILLION FROM THE BOOK AND HAS TO\nPAY I THINK $100,000 IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS BASICALLY FOR\nVIOLATING THE NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS WHICH IS A SERIOUS\nISSUE. BUT MY GOODNESS, YOU HAVE THE\nSECRETARY OF STATE SHOWING SUCH CAVALIER DISREGARD FOR NATIONAL\nSECURITY, OUR SECRETS, AND NOTHING HAPPENS TO HER.\nAND THEN YOU HAVE A GUY WHO IS ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, IN THERE\nRISKING HIS LIFE DOING THE SAME SORT OF THING AND, MAN, THEY\nREALLY -- THEY DROP A TON OF BRICKS ON HIM.\nAND IT LOOKS INCREDIBLY UNFAIR. >> JUAN, ARE YOU READY FOR THE\nSTORY TO GO AWAY? >> I DON'T THINK IT GOES AWAY.\nIN FACT, IT'S THE WAY IT GOES AWAY, SHARON.\nIF IT GOES AWAY BECAUSE PEOPLE PERCEIVE THAT THERE IS, AS THE\nFACEBOOK WRITER SUGGESTED, AN UNEQUAL DISPENSIZATION OF\nJUSTICE IN AMERICA AND THAT THE RICH AND FAMOUS AND POLITICALLY\nCONNECTED HAVE ONE STANDARD AND THE REST OF US HAVE ANOTHER,\nTHEN IT DAMAGES EVERYBODY, NOT ONLY HILLARY CLINTON BUT PLAYS\nINTO THE IDEA YOU HEAR FROM SO MANY TRUMP SUPPORTERS, THAT THE\nSYSTEM IS RIGGED, THE ELECTION'S RIGGED.\nYOU GOT TO MOVE AWAY FROM THAT AT SOME POINT TO GET BACK TO THE\nLEGITIMACY OF THE AMERICAN POLITICAL STRUCTURE.\nI WANT TO ADD THAT THE FBI SAID QUITE EXPLICITLY WHEN IT\nRELEASED INFORMATION ON ITS BACKGROUND INTERVIEWS OF MRS.\nCLINTON AND OTHERS TO THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS THAT THEY DID\nNOT MAKE A MISTAKE. THEY REITERATED THAT THEY MADE\nTHE RIGHT DECISION IN DECIDING NOT TO PROSECUTOR.\nTHERE IS NO LEGITIMATE BASIS FOR PROSECUTING HILLARY CLINTON.\nAS TO WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S MISCHIEF TO BE MADE WITH WHAT\nSHE SAID ABOUT THIS OR COULD IT BE INTERPRETED DIFFERENTLY, I\nTHINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE A LOT OF THAT BECAUSE, GUESS WHAT,\nREPUBLICANS ARE UNDER PRESSURE GIVEN THE POLL NUMBERS THAT SHOW\nHER BEATING DONALD TRUMP CONVINCINGLY.\n>> AND WE HAVE TO MENTION, TOO, COMEY WAS -- I MEAN, HE DIDN'T\nTREAT HER WITH KID GLOVES. HE SAID SHE MADE A LOT OF\nMISTAKES, SHE WAS EXTREMELY CARELESS AND IT'S POSSIBLE THAT\nFOREIGN HOSTILE ACTORS WERE ABLE TO ACCESS HER COMMUNICATIONS BUT\nTHIS IS SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO BE THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND\nHANDLE THE MOST SENSITIVE COMMUNICATION.\n>> THAT'S A LEGITIMATE ARGUMENT. BUT WHEN COMEY WAS ASKED, NOT\nONLY WAS THIS EXHAUSTIVELY REVIEWED BY THE FBI, REMEMBER,\nIF YOU'RE TALKING TO CLINTON CAMPAIGN PEOPLE, THEY'LL TELL\nYOU HOURS OF TESTIMONY BY MRS. CLINTON IN PUBLIC BEFORE THE\nCONGRESS AND WE STILL HAVE NO EVIDENCE THAT SHE VIOLATED THE\nLAW. >> NOT UNDER OATH.\n>> BUT IT DOES GO TO -- >> YEAH, EXACTLY.\nBUT IT DOES GO TO THE ISSUE OF HER JUDGE MACHINE AND WHETHER\nSHE'S FIT TO BE THE TOP COMMANDER, YOU KNOW --\n>> I THINK SHE COMES ACROSS TO MY MIND OF ENTITLED PRIVILEGE\nTHINKING SHE CAN SET THE RULES. >> SHE DOESN'T COME ACROSS.\nSHE IS, IN FACT, ENTITLED TO PRIVILEGE.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS TICKET AND DONALD\nTRUMP. IT WAS TRICKLING IN AT THE\nBEGINNING OF THE WEEK WITH THE WORD OF STEVE BANNON AND\nKELLYANNE CONWAY ADDED TO NEW POSITIONS OR ADDED.\nWE WERE TOLD IT WAS AN ADDITION AND THERE WAS NO SHAKE-UP.\nMY TWITTER BLEW UP WHEN I USED THE WORD \"SHAKE-UP COUNTY \".\nBUT THEN WITHIN A WEEK PAUL MANAFORT WAS GONE.\n>> THERE WAS A PERIOD WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT\nDONALD TRUMP NEEDS TO STOP BEING PROVOCATIVE.\nHE NEEDS TO GIVE POLL TESTED ANSWERS WHICH ARE THE SAME\nANSWERS THAT POLITICIANS GIVE. THAT'S NOT DONALD TRUMP'S BRAND\nAND ISN'T WHAT GOT HIM THIS FAR. IT SHOULDN'T BE WHAT THE\nREPUBLICAN NOMINEE IS DOING. USING PROVOCATION TO GET\nATTENTION AND TALK ABOUT SERIOUS ISSUES.\nTHE REASON THAT ISIS IS THE GLOBAL THREAT THAT IT IS TODAY\nAND NOT THE JV TEAM THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA TALKED ABOUT IS\nBECAUSE A VOID THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FOREIGN POLICY OF\nWEAKNESS CREATED IN IRAQ THAT WAS THEN FILLED.\nIF DONALD TRUMP IS BEING PROVOCATIVE BY STARTING\nCONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHETHER LIBERAL DOMESTIC POLICIES HAVE\nHELPED PEOPLE IN DETROIT OR AFRICAN-AMERICANS AROUND THE\nCOUNTRY, THAT'S DONALD TRUMP GETTING EARNED MEDIA, BEING AT\nHIS BEST AND THEN THINKING IT TO A NATURAL PURPOSE.\nSOMETIMES WHEN THESE ARE MORE NILISTIC AND NOT TIED TO A\nPOLICY PROPOAL THAT COULD MAKE LIFE BETTER FOR ALL AMERICANS.\nTHIS IS TRUMP SAYING I'M GOING TO BE PROVOCATIVE AND BE MYSELF\nAND BE CONNECTED TO GOOD SOLUTIONS.\nKELLYANNE CONWAY VERY COMPETENT AND STEVE BANNON ARE COMPETENT.\nTHESE ARE TWO VERY GOOD PEOPLE AND COMPETENT WHO ARE GOING TO\nALLOW DT DOT BE DONALD TRUMP AND HOPEFULLILE TYING IT TO GOOD\nCONSERVATIVE POLICIES. >> WE'VE SEEN PRAISE FOR HIM\nFROM THESE TELEPROMPTER SPEECHES, MAKING SPEECHES TO THE\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, TALKING ABOUT LAW AND ORDER AND\nEXPRESSING REGRET. THIS WAS NO DOUBT DONALD TRUMP'S\nBEST WEEK IN QUITE A LONG TIME. THE PROBLEM FOR TRUMP IS THAT HE\nDOESN'T GET THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT ANY MORE WHEN WE SEE HIM\nHAVE A ONE-OFF GOOD SPEECH OR A STRONG WEEK BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN\nTHAT BEFORE. IF YOU REMEMBER WHEN PAUL\nMANAFORT WAS HIRED EARLIER THIS YEAR, DONALD TRUMP ACTUALLY WAS\nPERFORMING QUITE WELL IN THE AFTERMATH OF THAT HIRE, THEN WE\nSAW HIM FALL OFF AGAIN. IT'S CONSISTENCY THAT'S THE\nPROBLEM. CAN DONALD TRUMP GET UP THERE\nDAY AFTER DAY, WEEK AFTER WEEK AND, TO MICHAEL'S POINT, BOTH BE\nHIMSELF BUT ALSO FOCUS ON HIS CORE MESSAGE, FOCUS ON POLICY?\nBECAUSE HE ACTUALLY DOES HAVE A MESSAGE THAT SHOULD BE\nRESONATING WITH THIS ELECTORATE WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT BEING AN\nOUTSIDER, ABOUT BEING THE ONLY CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE THAT CAN\nACTUALLY BRING CHANGE TO WASHINGTON.\nTHAT WILL RESONATE WITH PEOPLE. THAT GETS LOST AMONG SOME MANY\nOTHER THINGS. >> THE PIVOT REMINDS ME OF LUCY\nWITH THE FOOTBALL AND CHARLIE BROWN.\nEVERY TIME CHARLIE TRUSTS THAT SHE'S REALLY GOING TO HOLD IT,\nBUT NO. WHO IS HE GOING TO APOLOGIZE?\nTED CRUZ, TED CRUZ'S DAD, TED CRUZ'S WIFE.\n>> LUCY IS THE MEDIA? >> RIGHT NOW LUCY IS THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE OR REPUBLICANS WHO WANT TO VOTE FOR A\nREPUBLICAN AND KEEP THINKING  I >> DON'T GO ANYWHERE.\nTHE STATE DEPARTMENT ADMITS THE U.S. HELD OFF ON PAYING IRAN\nUNTIL AMERICAN HOSTAGES WERE FREE, BUT DO NOT CALL IT RANSOM.\nBACK IN TWO MINUTES.",

THE WORST OF IT WILL COME LATER\nTHIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE MAPS\nAND I'LL SHOW YOU WHERE YOU CAN EXPECT THE TEMPERATURES TO DROP\nIN WAKE OF THAT COLD FRONT. PARTS OF MICHIGAN, THE UPPER\nMIDWEST, 10 TO 15 DEGREES COOLER THAN IT WAS YESTERDAY.\nA NICE COOLER AIR MASS IN BACK OF THAT COLD FRONT, BUT WE'RE\nALSO SEEING THE POTENTIAL FOR MORE HEAVY RAIN.\nTHE TAIL END OF THAT FRONT ACROSS THE GULF COAST SO PARTS\nOF TEXAS AND LOUISIANA, UNFORTUNATELY, GETTING MORE RAIN\nIN THE FORECAST. ALSO DEALING WITH EXTREME HEAT\nACROSS THE WEST.

IN FIVE STATES THAT'S ONLY ONE\nINSURER UNDER OBAMACARE. >> WHAT WILL THAT DO FOR QUALITY\nOF CARE? >> IT MEANS YOU HAVE A MONOPOLY\nAND THE PRICE WILL GO UP AND THE QUALITY OF CARE VERY PROBABLY\nBUT NOT CERTAINLY WILL GO DOWN. IN 17 STATES THERE'S ONLY ONE OR\nTWO INSURERS. THAT'S A LOCAL MONOPOLY.\nTHAT'S NOT GOOD FOR QUALITY OF CARE OR FOR PRICING.\n>> THAT'S A NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE AT THAT POINT.\n>> YOU HAVE TO BACK OFF FOR A MINUTE WITHOUT GETTING INTO THE\nWEEDS. THE PLAN FACT IS OBAMACARE IS\nCOLLAPSING. IT WAS BADLY DESIGNED IN THE\nFIRST PLACE, VERY BADLY EXECUTED.\nINSURERS ARE NOW LEAVING AND PEOPLE ARE REFUSING TO SIGN UP.\nTHAT'S A LONG DRAWN OUT SLOW COLLAPSE.\nAND IT GETS EVEN WORSE ON NOVEMBER THE 1st.\nTHAT'S WHEN WE FIND OUT FORMALLY HOW MUCH THE PREMIUMS WILL GO UP\nNEXT YEAR.

AND IT'S GOING TO BE A PROBLEM\nFOR HILLARY BECAUSE THESE NEW PREMIUMS WILL BE ANNOUNCED ON\nNOVEMBER THE 1st. THE ELECTION IS NOVEMBER THE\n8th. >> WELL, THERE'S A BIG MOVEMENT\nIN THIS COUNTRY. WHY SHOULDN'T WE HAVE A NATIONAL\nHOLIDAY ON ELECTION DAY? IT'S ON A TUESDAY.\nOTHER COUNTRIES DO IT ON A WEEKEND.\nOTHER COUNTRIES HAVE A NATIONAL HOLIDAY.\nEVERYONE GETS THE DAY OFF AND YOU GO AND VOTE.\nWELL, SOME BIG SILICON VALLEY TECH FIRMS ARE RALLYING\nCOUNTRIES AROUND THE COUNTRY THIS TIME TO GIVE FOLKS THE DAY\nOFF ON TUESDAY, ELECTION DAY, IN THIS COUNTRY.\nGO TO THE POLLS. WE SHOULD MAKE IT A NATIONAL\nHOLIDAY. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS?\n>> YOU CALL IT SILICON VALLEY? IT'S OFTEN CALLED VALLEY OF THE\nDEMOCRATS. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, BIG\nHIGH-TECH COUNTRIES.

I'VE GOT IT HERE.\n>> A REALLY INVENTIVE NAME. >> TAKE ELECTION DAY OFF.\nTHE BIG TECH COMPANIES THINK IF THEY GIVE TIME OFF FOR THEIR\nWORKERS TO GO AND VOTE, THEY WILL VOTE FOR HILLARY AND THAT'S\nWHAT THEY WANT. SO THEY'RE BEHIND THIS EFFORT TO\nGIVE TIME OFF FOR YOUR EMPLOYEES ON ELECTION DAY.\n>> BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT PEOPLE WHO MAKE AN EFFORT TO VOTE AND\nWHO KNOW WHAT THEIR VOTING FOR NOT ALWAYS, BUT TEND TO VOTE\nREPUBLICAN. >> IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA,\nTHAT'S DEMOCRAT CENTRAL. CALIFORNIA IN GENERAL IS FOR\nDEMOCRATS. THESE BIG HIGH-TECH COMPANIES\nHAVE LOTS OF EMPLOYEES AND THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE --\n>> YOU HAVE A JOB BUT YOU VOTE ANYWAY, RIGHT?\n>> OF COURSE. >> YEAH.\nI HAVE TO TELL YOU, I HAVE TO BE HONEST HERE.\nI HAVE JUST BECOME A CITIZEN AND I WILL CAST MY FIRST VOTE EVERY\nON NOVEMBER THE 8th OF THIS YEAR.\nSO I WILL TAKE TIME OUT NO MATTER WHAT TO PASS MY VOTE.\n>> I HAVE TO SAY, REGARDLESS OF THE SILICON VALLEY SIDE OF THIS,\nI HAVE OFTEN AGREED THIS SHOULD BE A NATIONAL HOLIDAY OR IT\nSHOULD BE ON A WEEKEND. THAT WAY MORE PEOPLE CAN VOTE.\nWHAT IF PEOPLE HAVE TO WORK TWO JOBS AND YOU HAVE TO COME HOME\nAND TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN. >> THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH\nFACILITATING VOTING AND MAKING IT EASIER AND MORE AVAILABLE TO\nMORE AND MORE PEOPLE. BUT THIS EFFORT ON THE PART OF\nTHE HIGH-TECH COMPANIES THAT'S DELIBERATELY DESIGNED TO GET\nMORE PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR HILLARY. >> HERE IS THE OTHER THING.\nWE SHOULD HAVE DIGITAL VOTING BY NOW FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.\nWE CAN DO ALL OF OUR BANKING ONLINE.\n>> YEAH. >> HACKING.\n>> WE HAVE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS MOVING EVERY SECOND IN OUR\nDIGITAL BANKS.

CERTAINLY, CERTAINLY HIGH HOPES\nFOR TEAM USA IN REPEATING THAT SUCCESS.\nTHEN, OF COURSE, WE HAVE THE CLOSING CEREMONY, THE CLIMAX OF\nWHAT HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE THREE WEEKS HERE, GEORGE.\nSO MANY SECRETS AROUND THE CLOSING CEREMONY.\nWE KNOW THAT IT'S GOING TO BE A CELEBRATION OF WHAT'S BEST IN\nBRAZIL. THAT'S HOW IT IS BEING SOLD.\nWE KNOW THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF SAMBA DANCING.\nA JOURNEY THROUGH GENERATIONS. LOTS OF VOLUNTEERS AND DANCERS.\nAGAIN, THE QUESTION THAT WE STARTED THE OLYMPICS WITH, WILL\nTHEY BE INVOLVED? THERE WAS A SUGGESTION WE MIGHT\nSEE HIM HERE. AGAIN, WE JUST DON'T KNOW.\n>> REALLY HAS BEEN GREAT GETTING THE COVERAGE FROM YOU, FROM\nCHRISTINA, YOU FEEL THE ENERGY AND EXCITEMENT FROM YOU GUYS\nGETTING TO WITNESS HISTORY FIRSTHAND.\nAMANDA DAVIS, THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.\nWE'LL BE IN TOUCH ON THIS FINAL",

I LOVE THAT LINE.\nIT'S REALLY NOT THE FIRST TIME HE'S SPEAKING OUT, BUT HE'S\nSPEAKING OUT AT LENGTH SINCE THE TIME THAT HE WAS ALLEGED THAT HE\nWAS ROBBED AT GUNPOINT DURING A NIGHT OUT IN RIO.\nNOW HE'S APOLOGIZING FOR, QUOTE, EXAGGERATING THE TRUTH.\nBUT HE'S STOPPING SHORT OF ADMITTING TO THE ACCUSATIONS\nTHAT HE LIED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THE VANDALIZATION THAT\nTOOK PLACE AT THE GAS STATION. HERE'S WHAT HE TOLD NBC'S MATT\nLAUER. >> YOU SAID AT SOME POINT AFTER\nYOU REFUSED TO SIT DOWN, THE SECURITY GUARD PUT THE GUN TO\nYOUR FOREHEAD AND COCKED IT. >> THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.\nTHAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. AND THAT'S WHY I OVEREXAGGERATED\nTHAT PART. >> WHY DID YOU DO THAT?\n>> I DON'T KNOW WHY. YOU KNOW, IT WAS STILL HOURS\nAFTER THE INCIDENT HAPPENED. I WAS STILL INTOXICATED.\nI WAS STILL UNDER THAT INFLUENCE.\nAND I'M NOT MAKING ME BEING INTOXICATED LIKE AN EXCUSE.\nI'M NOT DOING THAT AT ALL. IT WAS MY FAULT.\nAND I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT. I SHOULDN'T HAVE EVEN JUST KEPT\nLIKE I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING. BUT I OVEREXAGGERATED THAT PART,\nAND THE GUN WAS DRAWN BUT NOT AT MY FOREHEAD.\nIT WASN'T COCKED AT MY FORWARD. IT WAS TOWARDS MY GENERAL\nDIRECTION. AND AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE\nSURVEILLANCE, THAT'S WHEN MY HANDS WENT UP.\n>> YOU TOLD ME ON THE PHONE, RYAN, YOU SAID, WE ARE VICTIMS\nHERE. WE ARE VICTIMS, AND WE'RE HAPPY\nTHAT WE'RE SAFE. IN THE POLICE PRESS CONFERENCE\nTHEY SAID NOT VICTIMS. THEY'RE VANDALS.\nHOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT? >> IT'S HOW YOU WANT TO MAKE IT\nLOOK LIKE. WHETHER YOU CALL IT A ROBBERY,\nWHETHER YOU CALL IT EXTORTION OR US PAYING JUST FOR THE DAMAGES,\nLIKE WE DON'T KNOW. ALL WE KNOW IS THAT THERE WAS A\nGUN POINTED IN OUR DIRECTION AND WE WERE DEMANDED TO GIVE MONEY.\n>> AND THAT'S A REALLY INTERESTING POINT.\nI WANT TO TAKE A LITTLE TIME ON THAT.\nIF I WERE TO ASK YOU THE SAME QUESTION AGAIN WERE YOU ROBBED\nON SUNDAY MORNING IN RIO, HOW WOULD YOU ANSWER?\n>> I CAN'T ANSWER THAT. BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF --\nBECAUSE I WAS INTOXICATED. SO I DON'T KNOW.\nALL I KNOW IS THAT THERE WAS A GUN POINTED AT US AND WE WERE\nDEMANDED TO GIVE MONEY. WHETHER IT WAS TO PAY FOR THE\nDAMAGES OF THE POSTER, WHETHER IT WAS EXTORTION OR WHETHER IT\nWAS A ROBBERY, LIKE, I CAN'T -- I CAN'T -- I'M NOT EQUIPPED\nTO -- >> BUT I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT\nGUNNAR, IN HIS STATEMENT TO POLICE SAID, AT SOME POINT\nSOMEONE WHO SPOKE ENGLISH WALKED OVER AND OFFERED TO HELP\nTRANSLATE THIS ALTERCATION. AND HE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THIS\nSECURITY GUARD WAS TELLING THE FOUR OF YOU YOU NEED TO PAY FOR\nTHAT STUFF, THAT DAMAGE BEFORE YOU CAN LEAVE HERE OR I'M GOING\nTO CALL THE POLICE. YOU UNDERSTOOD THAT AT THAT\nTIME, DIDN'T YOU? >> YEAH.\nSO THEN WE HAD TO GIVE THE MONEY.\n>> RIGHT. BUT AT THAT POINT IT'S NOT A\nROBBERY. AT THAT POINT YOU'RE STRIKING A\nDEAL. YOU'RE STRIKING A DEAL TO PAY\nFOR WHAT DAMAGE YOU'VE CAUSED SO THAT HE DOESN'T CALL THE POLICE,\nAND THIS DOESN'T BECOME A BIGGER INCIDENT.\nISN'T THAT FAIR? >> WE JUST WANTED TO GET OUT OF\nTHERE. WE WERE HELD -- I MEAN, THERE\nWAS A GUN POINTED IN OUR DIRECTION.\nWE WERE ALL FRIGHTENED. >> THAT'S UNCOMFORTABLE TO\nLISTEN TO. JOINING ME NOW ON THE PHONE\nCHRISTINE BRENNAN, SPORTS ANALYST AND I'M JOINED IN STUDIO\nBY PRESIDENT OF MARKETING INCORPORATED.\nCHRISTINE, LET ME START WITH YOU FIRST.\nTHE U.S. INTERVIEW WAS ACTUALLY JUST PART OF HIS APOLOGY TOUR T\nI GUESS YOU COULD CALL IT. HE'S ALSO APPEARED ON ONE OF\nBRAZIL'S BIGGEST TELEVISION NETWORKS.\nWHAT'S BEEN THE REACTION DOWN THERE TO HIS APOLOGY?\n>> MARTIN, I THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO MOVE ON FROM IT.\nCLOSING CEREMONIES ARE IN A COUPLE HOURS, GAMES ARE ENDING.\nTHE BRAZILIANS ARE PLEASED THAT THERE HAS BEEN AN APOLOGY.\nIT WAS A LONG TIME COMING. I THINK OVERALL FOR RYAN LOCHTE,\nCLEARLY HIS PUBLIC RELATIONS PEOPLE DID NOT TAKE A PAGE OUT\nOF THE MICHAEL PHELPS' APOLOGY PLAYBOOK BECAUSE PHELPS, OF\nCOURSE, HAS BEEN IN TROUBLE A COUPLE OF TIMES.\nBOTH TIMES THE NEXT DAY WITHIN 24 HOURS HE ISSUED A ONE\nPARAGRAPH APOLOGY TAKING FULL BLAME FOR EVERYTHING.\nTHE MARIJUANA PIPE PHOTO IN 2009 AND IN 2014 HIS SECOND DUI AND\nWAS SUSPENDED BY USA SWIMMING BOTH TIMES BUT GOT IT OUT OF THE\nWAY QUICKLY. THIS, DRAGGING IT ON FOR OVER A\nWEEK AND STILL NOT ABLE TO ANSWER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS I\nTHINK IS JUST A PUBLIC RELATIONS NIGHTMARE FOR RYAN LOCHTE.\n>> CARLOS, FROM A PUBLIC RELATIONS PROFESSIONAL AS YOU\nARE, I SAID THAT INTERVIEW WAS UNCOMFORTABLE.\nWHAT I MEANT BY THAT IS THAT YOU KNOW WHAT HE HAS TO SAY.\nJUST SAY IT. >> RIGHT.\nAND BE DONE WITH IT. BUT HE DOESN'T.\nHOW DO YOU THINK THIS HAS BEEN HANDLED?\n>> I THINK IT'S BEEN HANDLED VERY POORLY FIRST AND FOREMOST\nBY LOCHTE AND WHOEVER HIS PR REPRESENTATIVES ARE.\nI WAS VERY SURPRISED TO FIND OUT THAT HE HAD TO HIRE SOMEONE\nCONSIDERING THAT HE'S AN OLYMPIC STAR FOR SEVERAL OLYMPICS.\nYOU WOULD THINK THAT HE ALREADY HAS A PR, REPUTABLE PR\nREPRESENTING HIM. >> WHAT SHOULD HE HAVE DONE?\nWHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE VERY FIRST STEP?\n>> I'LL PIGGYBACK ON WHAT CHRISTINE BRENNAN SAID, AND I\nAGREE 100%, THE NEXT DAY HE SHOULD HAVE -- WELL, FIRST AND\nFOREMOST HE SHOULD HAVE NEVER CAME UP WITH THE LIE.\nBECAUSE IF HE DOESN'T SAY THAT, THERE'S NO HARM, NO FOUL, NO ONE\nKNOWS ABOUT IT. BUT TO DEAL WITH IT FROM A --\nCOMING BACK FROM THAT, HE REALLY SHOULD HAVE OWNED UP TO IT FIRST\nAND FOREMOST. SECOND OF ALL, NOT BLAME ALCOHOL\nOR ANYTHING OR DEFLECT BLAME ON ANY OF THE SITUATION.\nAND THEN SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE FOR THOSE THREE GUYS THAT WERE\nLEFT BEHIND. I THINK THOSE THREE THINGS, FOR\nME, AS A PR EXPERT, THOSE STICK OUT THE BIGGEST.\n>> HOW BAD IS THE DAMAGE HERE FOR HIM?\n>> I'LL TELL YOU, IT'S PRETTY BAD AND PRETTY MUCH HE COST\nHIMSELF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WE'VE HAD SITUATIONS,\nUNFORTUNATELY, OVER THE PAST WHERE WE'VE HAD TO SUCCESSFULLY\nNAVIGATE CLIENTS THROUGH MEDIA CRISIS MOMENTS AND WE WERE ABLE\nTO LUCKILY EACH TIME NOT ONLY CLEAR THEIR NAME BUT ALSO EVEN\nGET NEW ENDORSEMENTS, BUT IT'S BECAUSE OF HOW WE SUCCESSFULLY\nPUT TOGETHER A TEAM, PUT TOGETHER STRATEGY.\n>> WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE THIS TIME?\nWHY DO YOU NOT SEEM SO OPTIMISTIC?\n>> FOR ONE, LIKE CHRISTINE SAID, THIS HAS LINGERED ON FOR OVER A\nWEEK. AND IT'S REALLY A TRAGEDY\nBEC BECAUSE, YEAH, SO MANY GREAT\nATHLETES FROM ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY, ALL AROUND THE WORLD\nWHO WON OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALS FOR THEIR COUNTRIES AS WELL AS OUR\nCOUNTRY AND THE BIGGEST STORIES HAS ALL THIS WEEK BEEN RYAN\nLOCHTE. I REALLY FEEL THAT WE EVEN HAD\nCLIENTS THAT WON MEDALS AND, UNFORTUNATELY, THEIR STORIES\nKIND OF MINIMALIZED BECAUSE THE MEDIA WANTED TO FOLLOW THIS.\n>> THAT ADDS TO THE ANGER. >> YEAH, IT DOES.\n>> I WANT TO BRING UP SOMETHING ELSE CHRISTINE BEFORE WE LOSE\nYOU AND I KNOW TIME IS SHORT. THESE ATHLETES THAT ARE BEING\nFORCED TO PAY $3,000 EACH IN FINES BEFORE AUTHORITIES ALLOW\nTHEM TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY, WHAT ARE THEY ACCUSED OF DOING?\nWHAT'S THE LATEST ON THIS? >> YOU KNOW, MARTIN, I HAVE\nACTUALLY NOT FOLLOWED THAT STORY AS CLOSELY.\nI BELIEVE THERE WAS SOMETHING WITH THEIR I.D.s, I BELIEVE,\nTHAT THEY MADE FAKE I.D.s. AND YOU KNOW, I THINK THE BIGGER\nISSUE HERE IS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOUNG ATHLETES AND THINGS\nARE GOING TO HAPPEN. AND YOU WANT TO MINIMIZE IT.\nI THINK YOU'RE SAYING THAT IT'S THE AUSTRALIAN OLYMPIC\nCOMMITTEE, YOU'RE BRINGING HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE INTO A\nCOMMUNITY OR INTO THIS CRUCIBLE OF INTERNATIONAL INTRIGUE AND\nEVERYONE'S WATCHING AT THE WORLD'S STAGE.\nSO YOU WILL HAVE A FEW THINGS HAPPEN.\nIT'S HOW YOU HANDLE IT. THE AUSTRALIAN THING IS\nINTERESTING. OF COURSE, THERE'S ALWAYS GOING\nTO BE SOMETHING. BUT I THINK THE LOCHTE THING\nSTANDS OUT ONLY BECAUSE OF JUST HOW LONG IT WENT ON AND WHAT AN\nEMBARRASSMENT IT WAS FOR THE U.S. ESPECIALLY U.S. BEING THE\nBIG CHEESE AT THE OLYMPIC GAMES WHERE EVERYONE FOCUSES ON WHAT\nTHE U.S. DOES AND U.S. OLYMPICS LIKES TO HAVE THINGS BE VERY LOW\nKEY. ONE OF ONLY TWO OLYMPICS THAT\nDOES NOT ALLOW FLAGS OR BANNERS ON THE DORMS AT THE OLYMPIC\nVILLAGE. AND U.S. AND ISRAEL, OF COURSE,\nFOR SECURITY REASONS, BUT ALSO TO HAVE A LOWER PROFILE.\nTHEN THIS HAPPENS. SO THE AUSTRALIANS ARE DEALING\nWITH SOMETHING, THE U.S. DEALING WITH SOMETHING.\nIT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. BUT THE LAST THING THE U.S.\nWANTS, MARTIN, IS TO HAVE SOMETHING EXPLODE LIKE THIS ONE\nEXPLODED OVER THE LAST WEEK OF THE GAMES.\n>> YEAH, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.\nCHRISTINE BRENNAN, I HAVE ALL RESPECT FOR YOUR WORK, THANK YOU\nVERY MUCH. CARLOS SCOTT, THANKS FOR JOINING\nME TODAY. I HOPE I WOULD NEVER NEED YOU,\nBUT IT'S GOOD TO KNOW YOU'RE THERE.\nTHANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT UP THE WORK IS JUST\nBEGINNING IN LOUISIANA. YOU'VE SEEN THE IMAGES NOW.\nUNFORTUNATELY THERE'S MORE RAIN THAT'S COMING DOWN AND REPORTS\nOF A FLOOD WARNING AGAIN FOR BATON ROUGE, WE'LL CHECK IN ON\nTHE GROUND AND SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE RIGHT AFTER\nTHIS.",

I THINK THEY HAVE REALIZED THAT\nTHE MORE FUEL THAT IS POURED ON TO THIS FIRE, THE MORE OF THE\nSPOTLIGHT IS TAKEN FROM THE ATHLETES.\nTHEY WANT TO GET THE OLYMPICS OVER AND DONE WITH, GET BACK TO\nTHE UNITED STATES AND DEAL WITH IT THEN.\nBUT THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT THIS HAS BEEN A REALLY REALLY\nBIG PROBLEM FOR THE AMERICAN ATHLETES HERE.\nALL OF THEM. WHENEVER YOU GET TO A PRESS\nCONFERENCE, THAT IS A QUESTION THAT JOURNALISTS WANT IT",

WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OLYMPIC\nSWICKER RYAN LOCHTE. HE IS SITTING DOWN FOR AN\nINTERVIEW AND SOME LIKEN IT TO A CONFESSIONAL.\nWHAT HE IS ADMITTING TO IS WHAT HAPPENED THAT FATEFUL NIGHT IN\nRIO. >> HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE WAY\nYOU HAVE HANDLED YOURSELF SINCE SUNDAY MORNING, EARLY SUNDAY\nMORNING, WHEN THIS ALL WENT DOWN.\n>> SINCE EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED, I'VE BEEN LAYING LOW,\nJUST NOT -- I MEAN, I HAD THOSE STATEMENTS.\nI'VE TALKED TO YOU. BUT BEFORE I WANTED TO GOUT ON\nON-CAMERA, I WANTED TO REALLY MAKE SURE THOSE OTHER GUYS CAME\nBACK ON U.S. SOIL. AND WHICH I JUST FOUND OUT\nTHAT'S WHY I'M DOING THIS TODAY, IS JIMMY JUST CAME BACK.\nHE WAS THE LAST PERSON TO COME BACK.\n>> LET ME PLAY DEVIL'S ADVOCATE. IF YOU HAD COME OUT AND SET THE\nRECORD STRAIGHT EARLIER, GUNNAR AND JACK MAY NOT HAVE BEEN\nPULLED OFF THE PLANE AND JIMMY MAY HAVE COME BACK EARLIER.\nIF WOULD YOU HAVE TOLD THIS STORY EARLIER COULD YOU HAVE\nSAVED THEM PROBLEMS. >> ABSOLUTELY.\nTHAT'S WHY I'M TAKING FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR MY ACTIONS.\nBECAUSE IF I DIDN'T OVEREXAGGERATE THE STORY.\nTO WHAT I SAID WHEN I DID IT WHEN IT FIRST HAPPENED WITH\nBILLY BUSH AND YOURSELF AND I TOLD YOU THE FULL STORY, NONE OF\nTHIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED. WE WOULDN'T BE HERE.\nWE WOULDN'T BE SITTING HERE DISCUSSING THIS.\n>> SO YOU DIDN'T TELL HIM THE WHOLE TRUTH WHEN YOU SPOKE WITH\nME ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT BY PHONE, YOU DIDN'T TELL ME THE WHOLE\nTRUTH. >> I LEFT DETAILS OUT.\nAND WHICH THAT'S WHY I'M IN THIS MESS IS I LEFT CERTAIN THINGS\nOUT AND I OVEREXAGGERATED ON SOME PARTS OF THE STORY.\n>> ONE OF THE THINGS YOU EMBELLISHED WITH BILLY, WHEN YOU\nTALKED TO BILLY, IS YOU SAID AT SOME POINT AFTER YOU REFUSED TO\nSIT DOWN THE SECURITY GUARD PUT THE GUN TO YOUR HEAD AND DOCKED\nIT. THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN?\n>> THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. I OVEREXAGGERATED THAT PART.\n>> WHY DID YOU DO THAT? >> I DON'T KNOW WHY.\nIT WAS STILL HOURS AFTER THE INCIDENT HAPPHAPPENED.\nI WAS STILL INTOXICATED. I WAS STILL UNDER THE INFLUENCE.\nI'M NOT SAYING I'M MAKING ME BEING INTOXICATED AN EXCUSE, I'M\nNOT DOING THAT AT ALL. IT WAS MY FAULT.\nI SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT. I SHOULDN'T HAVE -- I'M NOT\nSAYING ANYTHING. BUT I OVEREXAGGERATED THAT PART\nAND THE GUN WAS DRAWN BUT NOT AT MY FOREHEAD.\nIT WASN'T COCKED AT MY FOREHEAD. IT WAS TOWARDS MY GENERAL\nDIRECTION. AS CAN YOU SEE IN THE\nSURVEILLANCE, THAT'S WHEN MY HANDS WENT UP.\n>> YOU TOLD ME ON THE FUN, RYAN. YOU SAID, WE ARE VICTIMS HERE.\nWE ARE VICTIMS. AND WE'RE HAPPY THAT WE'RE SAFE.\nAND THE POLICE PRESS CONFERENCE, THEY SAID, THEY'RE NOT VICTIMS,\nTHEY'RE VANDALS. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?\n>> IT IS HOW YOU WANT TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE.\nWHETHER YOU CALL IT A ROBBERY OR WHETHER YOU CALL IT EXTORTION OR\nUS PAYING JUST FOR THE DAMAGES. WE DON'T KNOW.\nALL WE KNOW IS THAT THERE WAS A GUN POINTED IN OUR DIRECTION AND\nWE WERE DEMANDED TO GIVE MONEY. >> AND THAT'S A REALLY\nINTERESTING POINT. I WANT TO TAKE A LITTLE TIME ON\nTHIS. IF I WERE TO ASK YOU THE SAME\nQUESTION AGAIN RIGHT NOW AND SAY WERE YOU ROBBED ON SUNDAY\nMORNING IN RIO, HOW WOULD YOU ANSWER?\n>> I WOULD BE, I CAN'T ANSWER THAT.\nI DON'T KNOW IF -- I WAS INTOX\nINTOXICATED. SO I DON'T KNOW.\nALL I KNOW IS WE HAD A GUN POINTED AT US AND WE WERE\nDEMANDED TO GIVE MONEY. WHETHER IT WAS IT PAY FOR\nDAMAGES OR IT WAS ROBBERY, I'M NOT EQUIPPED TO --\n>> GUNNAR IN HIS STATEMENT SAID, AT SOME POINT SOMEONE WHO SPOKE\nENGLISH WALKED OVER AND OFFERED TO HELP TRANSLATE THIS\nALTERCATION. AND HE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THIS\nSECURITY GUARD WAS TELLING THE FOUR OF YOU, YOU NEED TO PAY FOR\nTHAT STUFF, THAT DAMAGE, BEFORE YOU CAN LEAVE HERE OR I'M GOING\nTO CALL THE POLICE. YOU UNDERSTOOD THAT AT THAT\nTIME, DIDN'T YOU? >> YES BP, SO WE TODAY GIVE THE\nMONEY. >> RIGHT.\nSO AT THAT POINT, IT IS NOT A ROBBERY, AT THAT POINT YOU'RE\nSTRIKING A DEAL. YOU'RE STRIKING A DEAL TO PAY\nFOR WHAT DAMAGE YOU'VE CAUSED SO THAT HE DOESN'T CALL THE POLICE.\nAND THIS DOESN'T BECOME A BIGGER INCIDENT, ISN'T THAT FAIR?\n>> WE JUST WANTED TO GET OUT OF THERE.\nTHERE WAS A GUN POINTED IN OUR DIRECTION.\nWE WERE ALL FRIGHTENED. AND WE WANTED TO GET OUT OF\nTHERE AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE AND THE ONLY WAY WE KNEW IS THIS GUY\nSAYING YOU HAVE TO GIVE HIM MONEY.\nSO WE GAVE MONEY AND WE GOT OUT. >> THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A\nROBBERY. ROBBERY IS WHEN SOME GUY TARGETS\nYOU, WHEN HE IS ARMED OR NOT, TO TAKE YOUR MONEY AND BELONGS AND\nVALUABLES. THIS GUY WAS NEGOTIATING A DEAL\nBECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT WALK WAY AND YOU GUYS WERE ON\nTHE OTHER END OF THAT NEGOTIATION.\n>> THAT'S WHY IT COULD BE -- PEOPLE CAN SEE IT IN MANY\nDIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. ALL WE KNOW IS THERE WAS A GUN\nPOINTED TO US AND WE WERE DEMANDED TO GIVE THEM MONEY.\nAND END OF STORY. >> I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO\nGET AT, THE FIRST VERSION, RYAN, YOU TOLD IS MUCH MORE ABOUT THE\nMEAN STREETS OF RIO. >> YEAH.\n>> AND THE VERSION WE HEAR NOW IS MUCH MORE ABOUT A NEGOTIATED\nSETTLEMENT TO COVER UP SOME DUMB BEHAVIOR.\n>> AND THAT'S WHY I'M TAKING FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT.\nIS BECAUSE I OVEREXAGGERATED THAT STORY AND IF I NEVER HAD\nDONE THAT, WE WOULDN'T BE IN THIS MESS.\nTHOSE GUYS WOULD NEVER BE IN RIO OR WERE IN RIO.\nNOTHING OF THE -- NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED AND IT WAS\nMY IMMATURE BEHAVIOR OF, YOU KNOW, WE JUST FIN IBED.\nWE WERE WANTING TO CELEBRATE. AND WE HADN'T BEEN DRINKING OR\nANYTHING LIKE MONTHS BEFORE THAT.\nAND I DEFINITELY HAD TOO MUCH TO DRINK.\n THAT NIGHT. I WAS VERY INTOXICATED.\nAND NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF I DIDN'T DO THAT.\n>> ALL RIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.\nJOINING ME IS DANNY SAVOLLE, AND, LEE, SIX MINUTES PLUS OF\nTHAT INTERVIEW, WHAT DID YOU GET OUT OF IT?\n>> I GET OUT OF IT THAT HE IS STILL IN THE STATE OF DENIAL.\nFOR 42 YEARS I'VE BEEN REPRESENTING ATHLETES.\nSOMETIMES THEY GO OUT AND DRINK AT NIGHT.\nUSUALLY THEY DON'T KICK DOWN THE DOOR IN A BATHROOM TO GET IT\nOPEN. NORMALLY THEY DON'T VANDALIZE\nIT. NORMALLY THEY KNOW IF THEY DO\nTHAT THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR DAMAGES.\nHAD HE SPOKEN UP QUICKLY. HAD THEY PAID FOR THAT QUICKLY.\nHAD THEY NOT CHOSEN OUT THE POLICE TO VILLAINIZE AS IF THEY\nWERE ROBBED BY POLICE AT GUNPOINT, THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN.\nHE WAITED A WEEK TO DO THIS, A WEEK IN WHICH THE ACHIEVEMENTS\nOF ALL OF THE OLYMPIANS WERE CLOUDED.\nWE COULDN'T SEE 150 MEDAL WINNERS FROM THE UNITED STATES\nBECAUSE IT WAS ALL LOCHTE, LOCHTE, LOCHTE.\nWHAT HE SHOULD HAVE DONE IS HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE THE MINUTES\nTHE WORDS CAME OUT OF HIS MOUTH AND TAKEN RESPONSIBILITY.\nTHERE REALLY WASN'T A LOT OF LEGAL LIABILITY.\nTHERE ARE MANY CASES WHERE VANDALISM IN BRAZIL ENDS UP, AS\nLONG AS YOU MAKE SOME RESTITUTION, NOT EVEN BEING\nPROSECUTED. >> LET ME JUST STOP YOU FOR A\nSECOND. I WILL BRING IN DANNY.\nDANNY, THERE WAS A GUN AND YOU SPOKE TO THIS FACT LAST WEEK.\nAND AFTER THE PRESS CONFERENCE WITH AUTHORITY, YOU SEEMED\nSHOCKED THAT COPS CLAIMED THEY WERE NOT ROBBED.\nSO NOW YOU'VE HEARD THIS INTERVIEW.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK? IS IT EXTORTION?\nSOMETHING ELSE? WHAT DO YOU FEEL LEGALLY THIS\nIS? >> IT IS ODD TO ME.\nIT SEEMS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE LAST WEEK EVERYONE IS\nASTOUNDED THAT THE POLICE EITHER IN BRAZIL OR STATE SIDE MIGHT\nTAKE A POSITION THAT IT IS COMPLETELY OPPOSITE TO SOMEONE\nTHAT MIGHT BE CALLED A SUSPECT. THAT HAPPENED EVERY SINGLE DAY\nIN EVERY COURTHOUSE ACROSS THE LAND.\nTHE POLICE TAKE A POSITION THAT IS DIRECTLY OPPOSITE THAT OF A\nDEFENDANT. I'M HARDLY AN APOLL GIST FOR\nTHIS BEHAVIOR EXHIBITED BY LOCHTE THAT HE ADMITS TO.\nBUT AT THE SAME TIME, I WOULD RESPECTFULLY PUSH BACK A LITTLE\nBIT ON MATT LAUER. THOUGH IT WAS AN OUTSTANDING\nINTERVIEW, MATT LAUER SPEAKS OF IT BEING, THIS IS A NEGOTIATION.\n>> WITH A GUN. >> YEAH.\nTHERE AREN'T A LOT OF NEGOTIATIONS CARRIED ON IN THE\nUNITED STATES WITH ONE PARTY BRANDISHING A FIREARM.\nIT RAISES AN INTERESTING LEGAL QUESTION AS TO WHAT EXACTLY WAS\nBEING DONE WITH THE GUN. WAS IT AT HIS HIP.\nDOES IT MATTER IF IT IS OUT BY HIS BODY OR DOES IT MATTER IF IT\nIS POINTED RIGHT AT YOU? IT IS AN INTERESTING LEGAL\nQUESTION BUT TO SOME DEGREE RYAN LOCHTE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH\nABOUT HAVING A GUNPOINTED IN HIS DIRECTION.\nDID HE EXAGGERATE? YES.\nHE IS TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT, PROBABLY A LITTLE TOO\nLATE. BUT AGAIN AS CRIMINAL DEFENSE\nATTORNEY, HIS ADVISERS SURELY WAITED UNTIL HE WAS ABSOLUTELY\nCERTAIN HE WOULD NOT BE CALLED EXTRADITED BACK IT BRAZIL BEFORE\nHE WENT ON THE APOLOGY TOUR IN AN EFFORT TO SALVAGE HIS BRAND.\n>> THAT PART I FIGURED OUT. HE WOULDN'T BE SAYING WHEN A\nSAID IF IT WOULD STILL BE FOR THE PROSECUTION.\n>> LEE, LET ME ASK YOU THIS. WHAT DO YOU THINK THE FALL-OUT\nWILL BE? FOR SPONSORS AND DISCIPLINARY\nACTION? IS THIS GOING TO HAVE A LONG\nTERM IMPACT ON HIS CAREER? OR IS THIS JUST GOING TO PASS?\n>> THE LAWYERS WANT TO TAKE A VIKT POSITION OF SITTING BACK\nAND DOING THE FACTS AND WHERE FROM MARKETING STANDPOINT, THE\nISSUE IS BRAND. SO THIS IS A --\n>> SO WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF THE BRAND?\n>> THE IMPACT OF THE BRAND IS DEVASTATING.\nBECAUSE FOR A WHOLE WEEK YOU'VE HAD NEWS CYCLE AVENUES CYCLE,\nYESTERDAY IN NEW YORK, YOU HAVE UGLY AMERICAN ON THE FRONT OF\nONE OF THE TABLOIDS AND THE OTHER ONE IS THE LOCHTE MONSTER.\nAND IT'S GONE ON AND ON AND ON WITHOUT ANY REACTION AND IT\nBRANDS HIM IN A NEGATIVE WAY AND HE'S GOT A SERIES OF\nENDORSEMENTS. I THINK THEY WILL BACK AWAY.\nSECOND THING IS, RESENTMENT AMONG THE OTHER OLYMPIANS\nCOMPETING BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN DROWN OUT.\nNOW AS TO SANCTIONS I WOULD GUESS THAT THEY ARE ARE GOING TO\nSLAP HIM WITH A BAND AND THE U.S. OC CERTAINLY THE SWIMMING\nFEDERATION FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME.\nLOOK, HE DIDN'T -- HE DIDN'T COMMIT MURDER AND WITH THE\nPROPER APOLOGY, WE LOOK TO FORGIVE AND HE COULD GO ON.\nTHE COME BACK FOLLOWS THE FOLLOW THE HIGH AND MIGHTY.\nBUT THIS IS LINGERED FOR SO LONG WITHOUT AN APPROPRIATE RESPONSE.\nIT'S ALL BEEN LEGALISTIC. IT HASN'T BEEN THE HUNDREDS OF\nMILLIONS OF PEOPLE WATCHING THESE BROADCASTS WHO THINK OF\nHIM AS A -- SOMEONE WHO HAS NO REGARD FOR OTHER PEOPLE.\n>> LEE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DANNY, THANKS FOR YOUR INSIGHTS\nALSO. I HOPE WE WON'T TALK ABOUT THIS\nMUCH MORE BUT WE WILL SEE AS",

AND YOU'RE SITTING AT HOME IN\nTHE UNITED STATES SAFE AND SOUND.\nHOW DID IT MAKE YOU FEEL? >> HURT.\nI MEAN, I LET MY TEAM DOWN.

I TOOK AWAY FROM THAT.\nTHAT'S WHAT, I THINK, HURTS ME THE MOST, IS THAT ALL THAT --\nEVERYONE'S JUST WATCHING MY IMMATURE ANTICS.\nAND I'M JUST -- I'M EMBARRASSED. >> WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE OF RIO?\nTHEY DEALT WITH ALL THE HEADLINES GOING INTO THE GAMES\nABOUT POLLUTION AND VIOLENCE AND CRIME.\nAND HERE COME THIS IS STORY WITH ONE OF THE HIGHEST PROFILE U.S.\nATHLETES SAYING I GOT HELD UP AT GUNPOINT ON THE STREETS OF RIO.\nWHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THEM NOW? >> HOW SORRY I AM.\nAND MY DEEP EST APOLOGIES.

THE PEOPLE OF RIO, OF BRAZIL,\nTHE AUTHORITIES, EVERYONE THERE, THEY PUT ON A GREAT GAMES.\nAND MY IMMATURE, INTOXICATED BEHAVIOR TARNISHED THAT A\nLITTLE.

HE IS SAYING MUCH MORE AND\nTHAT'S WHAT HE SHOULD BE DOING. CLEARLY HE HAS GOT A P.R. FIRM\nWORKING WITH HIM AND WHAT A TERRIBLE JOB THEY HAVE DONE.\nTHE APOLOGY THAT WAS MORE OF AN EXPLANATION CAME OUT A COUPLE OF\nDAYS AGO. IT WAS LONG, IT WAS WINDING, IT\nWAS STILL TRYING TO EXPLAIN THINGS AWAY.\nHE APOLOGIZED TO HIS SPONSORS FIRST BEFORE HE APOLOGIZED TO\nTHE PEOPLE RUNNING THE RIO OLYMPICS.\nTHAT WAS CLEARLY NOT WELL RECEIVED SO NOW THEY'RE COMING\nBACK WITH THIS. IT'S HARD NOT TO LOOK AT RYAN\nLOCHTE AND SAY HE'S DOING THIS ONLY BECAUSE HE HAS TO BECAUSE\nHE REALIZES HOW MUCH TROUBLE HE'S IN.\n>> SO YOU BELIEVE HE IS SORRY? >> IT SOUNDS LIKE HE'S SORRY,\nBUT THE MOTIVATION FOR BEING SORRY -- I THINK THIS AVALANCHE\nOF NEGATIVE PUBLICITY HAS HIT HIM.\nHE'S A SWIMMER. HE'S 32 YEARS OLD.\nHE'S NOT A TEENAGER. THERE'S SO MANY QUESTIONS TO ASK\nABOUT HIS BEHAVIOR BASED ON HIS BEING 32 YEARS OLD.\nBUT TO HAVE PRODEPOFESSIONALS AD YOU, THIS IS A MAN WHO IS\nSUSPENDED AND IS TRYING TO GET A LESSER SUSPENSION.\n>> HE DID TALK ABOUT HIS HOPES FOR THE FUTURE, SAYING THAT HE\nWANTS TO CONTINUE SWIMMING IF THEY ALLOW HIM TO DO SO.\nWE KNOW MICHAEL PHELPS CAME BACK FROM TWO DUIS AND LOOK AT WHERE\nHE WOUND UP. HE DID THAT BECAUSE HE WAS\nCONTRITE, HE TOOK RESPONSIBILITY.\nDO YOU THINK THAT IS POSSIBLE FOR RYAN LOCHTE?\n>> I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE THAT HE WILL SWIM AGAIN AND BE ABLE TO\nBE A SPOKESPERSON FOR USA SWIMMING AND SHOW UP AT EVENTS\nAND DO MEET AND GREETS THAT ALL ALUMS KIND OF DO.\nTHERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT HE WAS EVEN GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE\nTHE 2020 OLYMPIC TEAM.

I THINK PEOPLE EXPECTED THIS TO\nHAPPEN YEARS FROM NOW, NOT WEEKS FROM NOW.\nSO IT'S PRETTY STUNNING. >> I JUST WONDER ABOUT -- THE\nREALITY IS YOU'RE DEALING WITH OTHER HUMAN OPERATED CARS ON THE\nROAD AND HUMANS TEND TO MAKE -- THE ARGUMENTS FOR DRIVERLESS\nCARS IS HUMANS MAKE MORE MISTAKES THAN COMPUTERS, RIGHT?\nYOU'RE NOT DEALING WITH OTHER COMPUTERS, AND THAT'S THE ISSUE\nHERE, JUST IN TERMS OF REGULATION.\n>> AND THAT'S WHAT WII SEEN.

INSTEAD OF OWNING A CAR, YOU\nWOULD RENT A CAR BY THE MILE OR SOMETHING.\nWHAT THE OWNER TOLD ME IS IT COULD BE CHEAPER PER MILE EVEN\nFOR RURAL AREAS EVEN MORE LONG DISTANCE TRIPS.\nIT'S GOING TO DRASTICALLY RESHAPE THE WAY THE AUTO\nBUSINESS WORKS.

            "text": "WAY.\nHE IS SAID TO HOLD RALLIES IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK, ALSO\nNEVADA. THOSE ARE STATES THAT SHOULD BE\nIN THE BAG FOR THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES.\nTHEY HAVE NOT BEEN BLUE FOR MANY YEARS.\nTHANK YOU, LADY, FOR BEING HERE. SALLY, I'M GOING TO BEGIN WITH\nYOU. WE JUST GOT THIS STATEMENT FROM\nTHE CLINTON CAMP, AND THEY SAID THEY DO NOT BELIEVE DONALD TRUMP\nHAS CHANGED HIS POSITION ON DEPORTING ALL OF THE ILLEGAL\nUNDOCUMENTED WORKERS IN THIS COUNTRY AT ALL.\nTHEY SAY WE BELIEVE THAT HAS NOT CHANGED.\nBUT LET ME PAUSE AT THIS. LET ME ASK YOU THIS.\nIF IT HAS CHANGED, AS MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS ACCORDING TO UNAVISION\nSAY FROM THAT MEETING YESTERDAY, DOES THAT COMPLICATE THINGS FOR\nCLINTON? DOES THAT MAKE IT HARDER IF HE\nCHANGES HIS HARD LINE STANCE ON THAT?\n>> I'M GOING TO BE HONEST, I DON'T REALLY CARE WHAT IT DOES\nFOR HILLARY CLINTON. THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE\nCOUNTRY IF DONALD TRUMP CHANGED HIS STANCE ON THAT.\nYOU KNOW, IT IS DEEPLY PROBLEMATIC WHEN HE PLAYS INTO\nTHE, YOU KNOW, HARSH CRACKDOWN, ANTI-IMMIGRANT DREAMS OF\nIMMIGRANTS WHO CAME HERE LIKE MY ANCE\nANCESTORS, LIKE MANY OF OUR ANCESTORS, AND SUGGEST THERE\nSHOULD BE A DEPORTATION FORCE THAT GOES INTO CHURCHES, GOES\nINTO HOMES, GOES INTO SCHOOLS AND ROUNDS THEM UP AND KICKS\nTHEM OUT OF THE COUNTRY. FORGET THE POLITICS IN THIS.\nI SINCERELY HOPE HE CHANGES WHAT IS A VERY IMMORAL AND UNLIKELY\nPOSITION. I WELCOME THAT.\n>> HE SAID BEFORE WE HAVE TO FOLLOW THE LAWS AND WE HAVE TO\nDEPORT THEM, HE HAS TALKED ABOUT DOING IT IN A HUMANE WAY.\nBUT TO YOU, DO YOU THINK PERHAPS GIVEN THE STRUGGLES THAT DONALD\nTRUMP HAS WITH THE MINORITY VOTERS -- IN THE LATEST FOX POLL\nHE'S DOWN 46% AMONG HISPANIC VOTERS AND HE IS PULLING 1% WITH\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS IN THE LATEST WALL STREET JOURNAL POLL,\nWOULD IT BEHOOVE HIM TO CHANGE HIS HARD LINE STANCE ON\nDEPORTING THOSE 11 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS?\n>> POPPY, I'M SORRY, BUT I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANYTHING HARD\nLINE ABOUT UP HOLDING THE CONSTITUTION AND FOLLOWING THE\nRULE OF LAW. THAT'S WHAT WE WANT.\nTHAT'S WHAT AMERICANS WANT, AND THAT IS WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS\nPROPOSING. HE'S NOT SAYING STOP ALL\nIMMIGRATION. WHAT HE WANTS IS PEOPLE TO COME\nHERE LEGALLY. THESE PEOPLE THAT COME HERE AND\nCROSS THE BORDER AND DON'T FOLLOW THE LAW, THEY'RE BREAKING\nOUR LAWS, AND IT'S NOT FAIR TO THE ONES THAT HAVE COME HERE AND\nDONE IT THE PROPER WAY. IT'S EXPENSIVE.\nTHEY PAY ATTORNEYS, THEY WAIT IN LINE FOR MANY YEARS TO COME HERE\nLEGALLY. WHAT IS WRONG WITH FOLLOWING THE\nLAW? THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH\nTHAT. THAT'S NOT INHUMANE.\nI'M SORRY, SALLY, BUT IT'S JUST NOT.\n>> I'M SORRY, CAN I JUST SAY, FIRST OF ALL, WHEN MY ANCESTORS\nCAME, THERE WEREN'T IMMIGRATION LAWS.\nWE DIDN'T HAVE A LINE. WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY HAVE ANY\nCAPS, ANY QUOTAS, NUMBER ONE. THAT'S TRUE OF A LOT OF\nAMERICANS, SO THAT'S NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO, A LOT OF AMERICANS,\nA LOT OF IMMIGRANTS COME TO THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY'RE BEING\nACTIVELY LURED HERE AND RECRUITED BY AMERICAN\nBUSINESSES, BUT WE AREN'T TALKING ABOUT ROUNDING THEM UP\nAND DEPORTING THEM. AND THIRD, LET'S BE VERY CLEAR.\nIF YOU WANT TO HAVE MILITARY OR POLICE FORCES THAT GO INTO\nCHURCHES AND SCHOOLS AND HOMES AND WORKPLACES AND ROUND PEOPLE\nUP AND DEPORT 11 MILLION PEOPLE, YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT INTERMENT\nCAMPS, AND THERE IS NOTHING HUMANE ABOUT THAT.\nIT'S NOT JUST PEOPLE OF COLOR THAT ARE AFFECTED BY THIS, A LOT\nOF VOTERS, WOMEN VOTERS, BLACK VOTERS THAT ARE HORRIFIED.\n>> I WANT YOUR RESPONSE TO IT, BUT AMY, THE QUESTION I WAS\nASKING BEFORE IS NOT WHETHER OR NOT YOU AGREE WITH IT OR NOT,\nWHETHER OR NOT IT WOULD BEHOOVE DONALD TRUMP IN THE POLLS,\nWHETHER IT WOULD HELP HIM GAIN THE VOTER GROUPS THAT HE NEEDS\nIF HE WERE TO CHANGE HIS STANCE ON THIS.\n>> I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE SEEN IN THIS ELECTION IS\nTHAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC ARE SICK AND TIRED OF WASHINGTON,\nD.C. AND POLITICIANS THAT CHANGE THEIR POSITION ACCORDING TO\nWHICH WAY THE POLITICAL WIND IS BLOWING.\nAND THE REASON DONALD TRUMP GOT AROUND 14 MILLION VOTES DURING\nTHE PRIMARY IS BECAUSE HE STOOD FIRM ON WHAT HE BELIEVED IN, AND\nI THINK HE NEEDS TO DO THAT NOW. AT THE SAME TIME, I WILL SAY\nTHAT I MMIGRATION IS NOT AN EAS ISSUE.\nIF THERE WERE SOMETHING EASY TO FIX THIS PROBLEM, IT WOULD HAVE\nBEEN DONE LONG AGO. THE PRESIDENT COULD HAVE DONE IT\nDURING THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF HIS ADMINISTRATION WHEN HE HAD\nTHE CONGRESS AND THE SENATE. >> UNDER THE OBAMA\nADMINISTRATION, A NUMBER OF UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS HAVE BEEN\nDEPORTED, SO MUCH SO THAT HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS HAVE CALLED HIM\nDEPORTER IN CHIEF. >> THIS IS NOT AN EASY THING TO\nFIGURE OUT. SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT FIGURING\nOUT WHAT THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS, IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME\nTIME. I'M GLAD HE'S PUTTING TOGETHER A\nTEAM OF PEOPLE TO WORK ON THAT, AND I LOOK FORWARD TO, IF THE\nREPORTS ARE RIGHT, THAT HE'S GOING TO PUT OUT HIS IMMIGRATION\nPOLICIES LATER THIS WEEK. I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING ABOUT\nTHAT. >> LET'S MOVE FORWARD.\nSALLY, I WANT YOU TO WEIGH IN ON THIS.\nIT HAS BEEN CERTAINLY A DIFFERENT STYLE OF A WEEK FOR\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT\nHAS BEEN THE BEST WEEK HE'S HAD IN A WHILE.\nKELLYANNE CONWAY IS IN CHARGE RIGHT NOW.\nWHETHER YOU AGREE WITH HER POLITICS OR NOT, SHE HAS BEEN\nCREDITED WITH A LOT OF SUCCESS IN THE REPUBLICAN FIELD.\nNOW OUR DANA BASH IS REPORTING TONIGHT THAT SHAWN SPICER, CHIEF\nCOMMUNICATIONS OFFICER, WILL BE WORKING OUT OF THE TRUMP TOWER,\nPART-TIME, AT LEAST. IS THIS CAMPAIGN GETTING ON\nTRACK MORE OF A THREAT TO CLINTON?\n>> THE BAR CONTINUES TO BE SET LOWER AND LOWER FOR DONALD\nTRUMP. THIS IS HIS BEST WEEK YET ONLY\nBECAUSE IT'S HIS LEAST DISASTROUS WEEK YET.\nBUT, YOU KNOW, THAT'S LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, PRAISING SOMEONE WHO\nUSUALLY GETS IN A FIGHT EVERY WEEK IN SCHOOL FOR SUDDENLY,\nLIKE, HEY, YOU DIDN'T HIT ANYBODY THIS WEEK.\nGOOD JOB, KID. THE BAR NEEDS TO BE SET A LITTLE\nBIT HIGHER BOTH FOR HIS CAMPAIGN AND FOR HIS CANDIDACY.\nAGAIN, THIS IS SOMEONE WHO IS RUNNING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE\nLEADERSHIP, THE AUTHORITY OVER THE ENTIRE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT,\nOUR ARMED FORCES, NOT TO MENTION SINGULAR CONTROL OVER OUR\nNUCLEAR ARSENAL, AND HE CAN'T EVEN GET HIS CAMPAIGN IN ORDER.\nTHAT'S HOW DISORGANIZED HE IS AND LEADER HE IS.\nPEOPLE SHOULD BE REALLY DISCOURAGED.\n>> SALLY, HE ISN'T A POLITICIAN. HE'S NEVER RUN FOR OFFICE\nBEFORE. AND ACTUALLY, I THINK IT'S A\nGOOD THING WHEN SOMETHING IS NOT WORKING.\nA REAL LEADER STEPS IN AND SAYS, THIS IS NOT WORKING, WE'VE GOT\nTO CHANGE THINGS, AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE'S DONE.\nI THINK TO CONTINUE TO DO THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER HAS\nGOTTEN DIFFERENT RESULTS. >> WE KNOW HE'S GOING TO OHIO\nTHIS WEEK. THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE.\nBIG BATTLEGROUND STATES, GOING TO NEVADA, I GET THAT.\nWHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS GOING TO MISSISSIPPI AND GOING TO",

JUST IMAGINE IF THE MEDIA SPENT\nTIMES AND LOTS OF TIME INVESTIGATING THE POVERTY AND\nJOBLESSNESS OF THE INNER CITIES.

THIS IS ABOUT EXTENDING THE\nTRUMP BRAND PAST NOVEMBER, BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S ABOUT\nNECESSARILY LAUNCHING A NEW MEDIA ORGANIZATION.\nTHE MEDIA ORGANIZATION THAT IS THE CRITIQUE THAT DONALD TRUMP\nJUST DESCRIBED AS BEEN AROUND SINCE ANDREW BREITBART.\nI THINK THIS IS ABOUT EXTENDING THE TRUMP AND THE POPULOUS BRAND\nSO IT'S NOT A TRANSITIONAL BRAND LIKE THE TEA PARTY OR THE DAVE\nBRATS OF THE WORLD. IT IS ABOUT IN MY MIND WHAT\nHAPPENS NEXT AFTER NOVEMBER IN TERMS OF THE FUTURE OF THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY. CAN THE RIGHT BECOME THE RIGHT?\nAND I THINK THAT'S THE NATURE OF THE CONVERSATION.\n>> ONE THING I KNOW THAT STEVE HAS BEEN INTERESTED IN FOR A\nLONG TIME, IS TO EXTEND BREITBART TO EXTEND THE CABLE\nMEDIA. >> IF TRUMP LOSES, WILL HE TRY\nTO LAUNCH A CHANNEL? IT'S VERY HARD IN THIS DAY AND\nAGE TO LAUNCH A NEW CHANNEL, BUT IF ANYBODY'S GOING TO DO IT, IT\nWILL BE DONALD TRUMP AND STEVE BANNON.\nWE'LL TALK ABOUT TRUMP SUPPORTERS SKEPTICISM IN SOME OF\nTHE NATIONAL POLLS YOU SEE.

WE'VE HAD ATHLETES THAT HAVE\nBEEN DISQUALIFIED SINCE THEY GOT THERE BECAUSE OF DOPING.\nTHERE HAS OBVIOUSLY BEEN SO MANY LOGISTICAL AND CHALLENGES FROM\nRIO HOLDING IT, WHICH HAS BROUGHT UP LOT OF QUESTIONS\nABOUT WHETHER YOU SHOULD CONTINUE HOLDING EVENTS LIKE\nTHIS IN COUNTRIES THAT ARE STILL WORKING ON SOME OF THEIR OWN\nINFRASTRUCTURE PROBLEMS. I THINK THOSE THINGS HAVE\nCLOUDED A LOT OF THE OTHERWISE INTERESTING STORIES ABOUT THE\nATHLETES. >> JUST TO RETURN IT TO THE\nATHLETE, DAN, I LOVE THE STORY OF THE CONTINUING RISE OF THE\nAMERICAN DISTANCE RUNNER. FOR TWO DECADES OR MORE, WE JUST\nDIDN'T REALLY DO VERY WELL. NOW YOU SEE AMERICAN DISTANCE\nRUNNERS COMPETING ACROSS NEARLY EVERY RACE.\nJENNIFER SIMPSON WON THE FIRST WOMAN'S MEDAL FOR AN AMERICAN\nNEVER THE 1500 METERS. AND WE WON STEEPLECHASE MEDALS\nIN FOR MEN AND WOMEN. I LOVE THAT TENSION IN THE RACE\nBETWEEN THE ENDURANCE AND THE SPEED AT THE END.\nYOU NEVER KNOW WHO IS GOING TO KICK TO FINALLY WIN THE RACE.\n>> YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE EXTRAORDINARY TRAINING AND\nTALENT THAT THESE ATHLETES DISPLAY ACROSS THE BOARD IN THE\nOLYMPICS. AND I THINK TO PICK UP KIM'S\nPOINT, THEY NEED A VENUE IN WHICH THEY CAN DISPLAY THOSE\nTALENTS. THE 2022 WINTER OLYMPICS ARE\nBEING HELD IN BEIJING, WHICH HAS NO SNOW.\nTHEY'RE BEING HELD THERE -- >> THERE MAY BE BLACK SNOW IF\nTHEY HAVE IT FROM SOOT OR COAL. >> THEY'RE BEING HELD THERE\nBECAUSE THE OLYMPICS HAVE BECOME TOO EXPENSIVE.\nSWEDEN, NORWAY AND POLAND PULLED THEIR BIDS FOR THE WINTER\nOLYMPICS BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD IT.\nIT'S BECOMING VERY DIFFICULT TO PUT ON A REPUTABLE OLYMPICS.\nAND THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE HAS GOT TO GO BACK TO\nTHE DRAWING BOARD ABOUT THE WAY THEY PUT THESE OLYMPICS\nTOGETHER. >> WITH A GOAL OF WHAT?\nPUTTING IN ONE SPECIFIC LOCATION?\n>> ONE OR SEVERAL VENUES THAT ARE PERMANENT, PEOPLE ARE\nTRAINED IN DOING IT, WHERE THE VENUES ARE LIVING UP TO THE\nSTANDARDS. >> THE INFRASTRUCTURE CAN BE\nREUSED. THAT'S THE PROBLEM.\nTHE RICH COUNTRIES, YOU BUILD THESE STRUCTURES, YOU TAKE ON\nALL THIS DEBT. AND THEN THEY BECOME GHOST TOWNS\nATTEND. THEY'RE NEVER USED AGAIN.\nWHEN YOU GO INTO A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY OR A LESS RICH\nCOUNTRIES, YOU A STRONG MAN OR AUTHORITARIAN DEALING WITH\nCONTRACTORS, ENRICHING THEMSELVES.\nI THINK A PERMANENT LOCATION WOULD ALLOW FOR THE\nINFRASTRUCTURE TO BE REUSED. AND THAT WOULD MAKE A LOT MORE\nECONOMIC SENSE. >> IF YOU PUT IT IN A PERMANENT\nLOCATION, THAT PROVIDES A PERMANENT ADVANTAGE FOR WHEREVER\nTHAT IS. I'M NOT SAYING IF YOU PUT IT --\nSO YOU PUT IT IN EUROPE, THE EUROPEANS WOULD HAVE AN\nADVANTAGE. YOU PUT IT IN ASIA, THE ASIANS\nWOULD HAVE AN AGREEMENT. NOBODY IS GOING TO AGREE TO PUT\nIT IN THE UNITED STATES. I CAN TELL YOU THAT.\nIS THAT REALLY A POSSIBLE OUTCOME?\n>> IT'S PROBABLY NOT.

THAT'S 360,000 SINCE THE MIDDLE\nOF LAST YEAR. THE NUMBER OF DAILY SUSPENSIONS\nWE'RE TOLD ARE UP BY 80%. IS IT ENOUGH TO MAKE A DENT IN\nTHE TERRORIST COMMUNICATIONS. MORGAN WRIGHT IS A SENIOR FELLOW\nOF GOVERNMENT AND JOINS US NOW. MORGAN, FIRST QUESTION, WHY\nHAVEN'T THE SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES BEEN MORE AGGRESSIVE\nON THAT BEFORE? >> THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.\n ON FOX AND FOX BUSINESS TALKING ABOUT.\nTHEY'VE USED THE RESOURCES OF THE UNITED STATES, YOU KNOW, THE\nECONOMY CAPITALISM TO GROW THIS BUSINESS SO AT SOME POINT, NOT\nONLY DO THEY HAVE A MORAL AND ETHICAL OBLIGATION, IT IS\nBECOMING A LEGAL OBLIGATION, AFTER THE ATTACKS IN PARIS.\nSOMEONE IS SUING FACEBOOK FOR THE BROADCAST WHEN THE POLICE\nCOMMANDER WAS KILLED. THEY'RE SUING THEM FOR USING\nFACEBOOK LIVE. WHY ISN'T IT DONE BEFORE, I\nDON'T KNOW IF THEY HAD A GOOD HANDLE ON IT.\nI DON'T THINK ENOUGH IS BEING DONE, BECAUSE IT IS NOT JUST\nTWEETING. IT IS THE LIVE VIDEO BEING MORE\nPROBLEMATIC THAN ANYTHING I THINK.\n>> TALKING ABOUT THE LIVE VIDEO, IT IS SO DISGUSTING.\nWE SAW THAT LIVE VIDEO STREAMING IN FRANCE OF THE RADICAL ISLAMIC\nTERRORIST, HE STABBED A POLICE OFFICIAL, TORTURED HIS WIFE AND\nHE HAD THE TODDLER IN THE ROOM, AND ON FACEBOOK LIVE, YOU KNOW,\nSHOWING THIS LIVE, SAYING YOU KNOW, SHOULD I KILL HIM, SHOULD\nI KILL THE KID TOO. THAT'S HORRIBLE.\nWHY DIDN'T FACEBOOK HAVE THE ABILITY SINCE THEY CAN DO\nANYTHING ELSE IT SEEMS TO PULL THE PLUG?\n>> LOOK, WITH THE MARKETING, THEY CAN TELL YOU WHO WILL BUY,\nWHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BUY. THEY'VE GOT SO SOPHISTICATED, SO\nI DON'T EXACTLY BY THE FACT THAT THEY CAN'T DEAL WITH VIDEO.\nLOOK, I'LL TELL YOU, ERIC, IT ISN'T JUST DEALING WITH VIDEO.\nTWITTER SUSPENDED GOVERNMENT ACCESS TO THEIR MAIN DATA FEED,\nTHEIR FIRE HOSE FEED THROUGH DATA MINER.\nIT IS INCREASINGLY MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE LAW\nENFORCEMENT TO GET ACCESS TO LOOK AT THE TRENDS GOING ON AND\nI'LL TELL YOU, IT IS NOT JUST THE NUMBER OF ACCOUNTS THEY'VE\nCLOSED. ARE THEY CLOSING THE RIGHT\nACCOUNTS, CLOSING THE INFLUENCERS.\nLOOK, WHEN THEY LAUNCHED THE HARRY POTTER THEME PARK, THEY\nONLY WENT TO FOUR BLOGS AND GOT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO COME TO\nTHE THEME PARK. THAT'S THE POWER OF GETTING THE\nRIGHT PEOPLE. >> I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU\nJUST MENTIONED ABOUT THAT. THAT WAS WHEN TWITTER DID NOT\nALLOW THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES HAVE TO ACCESS.\n>> TO THEIR MAIN TWITTER FEED. THEY HAVE A FIRE HOSE FEED,\nBASICALLY EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, THEY\nCUT OFF ACCESS. THEY SAID WE DON'T WANT TO DO\nSURVEILLANCE. >> THEY DID NOT LET THE\nGOVERNMENT HAVE ACCESS TO THAT IN.\n>> NO, THEY SHUT OFF ACCESS. >> DO THEY HAVE A POINT OR JUST\nWAY OFF BASE? >> THEY SAID IT WAS BECAUSE THEY\nDIDN'T WANT TO SUPPORT SURVEILLANCE, LOOK LIKE THEY\nWERE COLLABORATING WITH GOVERNMENT.\nTHIS IS A SNOWDEN EFFECT, THE ISSUE WITH APPLE, THE SAN\nBERNARDINO SHOOTER PHONE, SO THINK IT IS A COMBINATION OF\nTHINGS. >> WELL, IT IS TROUBLING AND\nHOPEFULLY WE CAN GET A HANDLE ON IT.\n>> ABSOLUTELY. >> MORGAN, THANK YOU FOR JOINING\nUS.",

KEVIN, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.\nI WANT TO PLAY SOMETHING FOR YOU.\nRUDY GIULIANI WHO HAS BEEN ON THE STUMP QUITE A BIT WAS ON FOX\nNEWS SUNDAY AND HE WAS SAYING THAT THE CHANGE OF TONE IS\nREALLY A REFOCUS. HE WANT YOU TO LISTEN AND GET\nYOUR REACTION. >> DONALD TRUMP IS EXTREMELY\nFOCUSED NOW. IF YOU LOOK AT HIS ENTIRE WEEK,\nYOU CAN SEE IT WAS FOCUSED ON ISSUES.\nHARD ISSUES. TOUGH ISSUES.\nISSUES ON WHICH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AGREE WITH HIM AND WITH\nUS. MAYBE 60, 65%.\n65 TO 70% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BELIEVE THE COUNTRY IS GOING IN\nTHE WRONG DIRECTION. AND IF HE CAN CONVINCE THEM THAT\nHE IS THE PERSON TO LEAD US, THEN CERTAINLY, HE IS THE ONLY\nONE TO GIVE US CHANGE. >> GIVE US CHANGE.\nSO HE IS REFOCUSED, IS IT GOING TO STICK AND DO YOU ATTRIBUTE TO\nTHE CAMPAIGN SHAKE-UP THIS WEEK? >> IT WAS A GOOD WEEK FOR DONALD\nTRUMP. LET'S START WITH THAT.\nBRINGING IN KELLYANNE CONWAY SEEMS TO HAVE A GOOD EFFECT ON\nTHE CAMPAIGN SO FAR. DOES HE HAVE THE TEMPERAMENT TO\nBE COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND WHETHER THEY'VE MADE UP THEIR\nMIND REMAINS TO BE DETERMINED IN THE POLLING THAT WILL COME OUT\nIN THE NEXT WEEK OR TWO. IF HE CAN STICK TO THIS.\nTHAT'S THE BIGGEST QUESTION WE ALWAYS HAVE WITH DONALD TRUM\nCAN HE STICK TO A MESSAGE AND NOT CREATE THE UNNECESSARY DRAMA\nHE HAS BEEN SUSCEPTIBLE TO. >> WE'VE HAD SO MANY COME ON THE\nSHOW AND SAY ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS.\nYOU SPOKE WITH ABOUT KELLYANNE CONWAY AND SHE PAIRED THIS\nMORNING ON CNN, AND SHE SAID LISTEN, IT IS TBD WHETHER DONALD\nTRUMP WILL MAKE THE CALL WHETHER HE WANTS TO DEPORT UP 11 MILLION\nUNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS OUT OF THE UNITED STATES IF HE BECOMES\nPRESIDENT. WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO THAT?\nDO YOU FEEL IF IT IS NOT JUST WORDS NOW, IF HE IS CHANGING THE\nACTIONS AND WILL PEOPLING RECEPTIVE TO THAT.\n>> I DON'T THINK IT WILL HURT HIM WITH HIS SUPPORTERS AND\nCOULD POSSIBLY SIGNAL A CHANGE FOR THE CAMPAIGN.\nI THINK, LOOK, THEY'RE GOING TO JUST SAY HIS SUPPORTER ALSO SAY\nIT IS A NEGOTIATING POSITION HE WAS STARTING FROM.\nEVERYTHING THAT HE HAS PROMISED THAT SUNDAYS GRANDIOSE AND\nCRAZY, ALE JUST SAY IT WAS A NEGOTIATING POSITION AND STILL\nGET THE WALL AND SOME OTHER IMMIGRATION CHANGES.\nSO HE IS NOT -- HE IS IN A BETTER POSITION DOING THIS, I\nTHINK, THAN NOTHING DOING IT. IT IS STILL AN OPEN QUESTION\nWHETHER IT WILL WORK. >> I WANT TO GET YOUR REACTION\nABOUT SOMETHING. WE TALKED ABOUT HIM REACHING OUT\nTO MINORITY GROUPS, THE STANCE WE HEARD FROM KELLYANNE CONWAY\nIN REGARDS TO THE PROBABLY NOT DEPORTATION OF 11 MILLION\nUNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. WHAT ABOUT HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH\nTHE RNC AND SOME OF THE GOP LEADERS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN REALLY\nRECEPTIVE TO HIM RUNNING. DO YOU THINK THEY'LL BE SHIFTING\nNOW WITH SOME OF THE TONE SHIFT THAT WE'VE SEEN?\n>> WELL, THE RNC HAS BEEN FULLY BEHIND HIM, MOST OF THE HOUSE\nAND SENATE SAID THEY'LL BACK HIM.\nTHERE HAS BEEN A FEW EXCEPTIONS. THERE ISN'T A MASS GROUP OF\nELECTED OFFICIALS IN THE RNC THAT HAVE DEFECTED FROM\nBUT IN THE PERCENTAGES OF REPUBLICANS, HE STILL HAS A\nPROBLEM, DOING WORST WITH REPUBLICANS THAN HILLARY CLINTON\nIS DOING WITH DEMOCRATS, AND HE NEEDS TO GET THEM BACK.\nWE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY'LL COME HOME.\n>> HOW DOES HE PLEASE BOTH SIDES?\nHE HAS A LOT OF WORK TO DO ON BOTH SIDES, EVEN IN THE GROUP\nTHAT WE DIDN'T THINK HE WOULD REALLY HAVE TO PLEASE AT THIS\nPOINT? >> WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE\nKELLYANNE CONWAY KIND OF HAS THAT SOLVED FOR THE MOMENT.\nIT ALMOST, YOU KNOW, YOU COULD HEAR KIND OF A CORE MESSAGE THAT\nHE HAS HAD. BUT IT WAS SOFTER IN SOME WAYS.\nYOU KNOW, IF HE CAN STICK TO IT, YOU KNOW, WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO\nSEE SOME SORT OF MOVEMENT OF REPUBLICANS BACK TO DONALD TRUMP\nAND YOU KNOW, SOME INDEPENDENTS WHO WANT TO GIVE HIM ANOTHER\nLOOK. HILLARY CLINTON HAD A TERRIBLE\nWEEK AGAIN THIS WEEK, AND SHE -- THE ADMINISTRATION CHANGED THE\nDEFINITION OF, YOU KNOW, THE WORD RANSOM, AND THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION IS STILL GOING TO TAKE FOREIGN DONATIONS AND\nCORPORATE MONEY UP UNTIL INAUGURATION DAY.\nPEOPLE DEFINITELY HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON.\n>> YEAH, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING HE HAS MATERIAL TO WORK\nWITH.

THAT MEANS THAT WE WILL TAKE AS\nMANY ATTEMPTS AS WE CAN TO GET A CLEAN RESTART.\nONCE THE DRIVERS TAKE THE GREEN THEY'LL TRY TO MAKE IT AROUND TO\nTHE OVERTIME LINE ON THE BACK STRETCH.\nIF THEY GET TO THE OVERTIME, IF THE RACE LEADER GETS TO THE\nOVERTIME LINE BEFORE A FLAG COMES OUT, THEN THEY WILL BE\nABLE TO RACE TO THE CHECKERED FLAG\nIF A CAUTION COMES OUT AFTER THAT, THE FIELD IS FROZEN.\nTHEY WILL GO TO VIDEO AND DETERMINE WHO THE RACE WINNER\nWILL BE.

WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO\nARE YOU GOING TO PIT, STAY OUT THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION TOO WHEN\nWE GO BACK GREEN >> TIRES HAVE BEEN SITTING OUT\nHERE IN THE RAIN ALL NIGHT ABOUT 12 HOURS ALREADY\nWE DID GET SOME RACING IN LAST NIGHT, ABOUT 38 LAPS, 31\nGREEN-FLAG LAPS, AND ANOTHER 17 THAT WERE UNDER CAUTION.\nLET'S TAKE ALOOK BACK AT SOME OF THAT ACTION ACTION THAT TOOK\nPLACE.

IN FACT A LITTLE BIT HIGH IN\nSOME STATES LIKE IOWA FOR EXAMPLE.\nTHE FOCUS IS THAT IT'S HARD TO REACH MINORITY VOTERS ON THE\nPHONE, HARD TO REACH YOUNGER VOTERS ON THE PHONE, YOU CAN\nFIND VARIOUS WAYS TO ADJUST FOR THAT.\nBUT THERE HAVE BEEN IN PRESIDENTIAL YEARS UNDERCOUNTING\nOF DEMOCRATS INSTEAD OF REPUBLICANS.\n>> SO YOU'RE SAYING IF THERE'S A HIDDEN TRUMP VOTE, THERE COULD\nBE A HIDDEN CLINTON VOTE AS WELL?\n>> ON ELECTION DAY, IT COULD BE CLINTON PLUS ONE, IT COULD ALSO\nBE CLINTON PLUS EIGHT. >> SO THERE'S A MARGIN OF ERROR\nIN EVERY POLL? >> SOMETIMES THE POLL DO NOT PEG\nOR TURN OUT RIGHT. FOR EXAMPLE SOMETHING LAST\nMINUTE MIGHT SHIFT. I THINK TRUMP CAN WIN THIS\nELECTION, OUR MODELS DO TOO. I ALSO THINK IT'S WORSE FOR\nCLINTON. >> YOU WERE A FAMOUS TRUMP\nSKEPTIC IN THE PRIMARIES, YOU HAVE ADMITTED YOU WERE WRONG IN\nSOME WAYS, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO RESET YOUR OPINION IN THE FALL?\n>> IN SOME WAYS JUST TAKING THE POLLS AT FACE VALUE AND NOT\nTRYING TO OVERTHINK THEM. IF YOU SAY, LOOK, HE'S DOWN BY 6\nOR 7 POINTS, TAKING THE POLLS AT FACE VALUE AND NOT EXPECTING\nSOME MIRACLE PIVOT, NOT EXPECTING SOME NEWS THAT GREATLY\nSHAKES THINGS UP. IRONICALLY THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN\nLOOKS SO SMART BY TOUTING THE POLLS IN THE PRIMARIES AND NOW\nTHEY'RE DENYING THE VERY SAME DATA POINTS THAT MADE FRANKLY A\nLOT OF PEOPLE LIKE ME LOOK FOOLISH BACK IN THE SPRING.\n>> BOTTOM LINE, WHEN WE SEE TRUMP SUPPORTERS AND TRUMP\nSPOKES PEOPLE QUOTING THE L.A. TIMES POLL, PEOPLE ARE CHERRY\nPICKING. >> YOU HAVE A POLLING AVERAGE,\nIT TAKES SIX OR SEVEN OR EIGHT POLLS, I DO THINK THE RACE HAS\nTIGHTENED BY A POINT OR TWO, THAT'S WHAT OUR MODEL SAYS.\nTHERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN STILL HAS TO DO,\nAND THEY HAVE A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME AND IF THEY WANT TO HAVE A\nSHOT AT BEATING CLINTON, THEY NEED TO LOOK AT THE RACE\nDIFFERENTLY IS MORE IN LINE WITH WHAT THEY NEED TO DO.\n>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.",

THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING THIS\nYEAR. >> HOW ARE THEY DOING THAT,\nRUNNING AN INDEPENDENT CAMPAIGN? HOW DO YOU MAKE A CAMPAIGN LIKE\nTHE SENATE WHICH IS USUALLY -- YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T HEAR AS MUCH\nABOUT WHEN IT'S A PRESIDENTIAL YEAR BECAUSE THE PRESIDENTIAL\nRACE GETS ALL THE ATTENTION FROM THE FREE MEDIA.\nHOW DO YOU LIFT A CAMPAIGN UP SO THE REPUBLICAN VOTERS WHO MIGHT\nBE SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE TOP OF THE TICKET SAY, I GOT TO GET OUT\nTHERE AND VOTE FOR THAT SENATE CANDIDATE?\n>> THREE WORDS. LOCALIZE, LOCALIZE, LOCALIZE.\nTHE SENATORS NEED TO MAKE A COMPELLING CASE THAT THEIR\nSERVICE IN THE SENATE HAS MADE LIFE BETTER FOR THE CONSTITUENTS\nIN THEIR STATES. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT SOME OF THE\nCANDIDATES ARE DOING, MARCO RUBIO ON THE ZIKA VIRUS, ROB\nPORTMAN ABOUT THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC IN OHIO, YOU'RE SEEING\nSENATORS TAKE THAT LESSON TO HEART AND THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT\nLOCAL ISSUES AND HOW THEIR SERVICE MADE LIFE BETTER FOR\nPEOPLE IN THEIR STATE. >> I'M ALSO HEARING NATIONAL\nREPUBLICAN FIGURES SAYING IF WE GO INTO SEPTEMBER AND DONALD\nTRUMP IS STILL TRAILING BADLY IN THE POLLS THAT WHAT YOU'LL SEE\nARE THE NATIONAL CAMPAIGN COMMITTEES SHIFT RESOURCES TO\nTHE HOUSE AND SENATE RACES. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN OCTOBER,\nAS YOU KNOW, IN 1996 WITH BOB DOLE AND IT LOOKED LIKE DOLE\nCOULDN'T WIN. DOES THAT HAVE TO HAPPEN THIS\nYEAR AS WELL AND HOW EARLY DOES THAT HAVE TO HAPPEN?\n>> IT MAY VERY WELL HAPPEN THIS YEAR, PAUL.\nWE'LL HAVE TO TALK TO THE OFFICIALS IN CHARGE OF THAT.\nLET ME GIVE YOU ONE DATA POINT FROM 1996.\nBOB DOLE LOST TO BILL CLINTON BY 8 1/2 PERCENTAGE POINTS.\nTHE AVERAGE REPUBLICAN HOUSE INCUMBENT RAN 16 POINTS AHEAD OF\nBOB DOLE IN THAT YEAR AND THEY LOST ONLY FIVE SEATS.\nTHERE IS A RECORD OF PEOPLE DOING THIS IN DIFFICULT\nENVIRONMENTS, AND THAT'S WHY I'M MORE OPTIMISTIC.\n>> BUT THEY'LL NEED TO SPEND A LOT MORE MONEY, WOULD YOU AGREE\nWITH THAT? >> OF COURSE, OF COURSE.\n>> THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.",

AND YOU WILL PROBABLY BE RIGHT.\nIN 2014, ABOUT 30,000 PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN TERROR ATTACKS\nWORLDWIDE. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE\nPERPETRATING THE VIOLENCE WERE MUSLIM.\nBUT -- AND THIS IS IMPORTANT -- SO WERE THE VICTIMS.\nOF THE 30,000 DEAD, THE VAST, VAST MAJORITY WERE MUSLIMS.\nTHAT'S CRUCIAL TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE IT SHEDS LIGHT ON THE\nQUESTION, \"WHY DO THEY HATE US?\" ISLAMIC TERRORISTS DON'T JUST\nHATE AMERICA OR THE WEST. THEY HATE THE MODERN WORLD AND\nTHEY PARTICULARLY HATE MUSLIMS WHO ARE TRYING TO LIVE IN THE\nMODERN WORLD. LET'S BE CLEAR, WHY THE JIHADIS\nARE FEW, THERE'S A LARGER CANCER WITHIN THE WORLD OF ISLAM, A\nCANCER OF BACKWARDNESS AND EXTREMISM AND INTOLERANCE.\nMOST OF THE COUNTRIES THAT HAVE LAWS THAT RESTRICT THE FREE\nEXERCISE OF RELIGION ARE MUSLIM MAJORITY.\nALL THAT HAVE LAWS AGAINST LEAVING THE FAITH ARE MUSLIM\nMAJORITY. BUT ARE THESE THINGS INHERENT IN\nTHE RELIGION? WHEN EXPERTS TRIED TO EXPLAIN IN\nTHE 14th CENTURY ISLAMIC CIVILIZATION WAS THE WORLD'S\nMOST ADVANCED OR THAT THE KORAN WAS ONCE READ AS A LIBERAL AND\nPROGRESSIVE DOCUMENT, THEY ARE NOT TRYING TO DENY THE REALITIES\nOF BACKWARDNESS TODAY. WHAT THEY ARE SAYING IS IT CAN\nCHANGE. ISLAM, AFTER ALL, HAS BEEN\nAROUND FOR 14 CENTURIES. THERE HAVE BEEN PERIODS OF WAR\nBUT ALSO OF PEACE. IT'S THE SAME RELIGION THEN AND\nNOW. SO WHAT IS DIFFERENT?\nIT'S NOT THEOLOGY. IT'S POLITICS.\nRADICAL ISLAM IS THE PRODUCT OF THE BROKEN POLITICS AND STAGNANT\nECONOMICS OF MUSLIM COUNTRIES. THEY HAVE FOUND IN RADICAL\nRELIGION AN IDEOLOGY THAT LETS THEM RAIL AGAINST THE MODERN\nWORLD, AN IDEOLOGY THAT IS NOW BEING EXPORTED TO ALIENATED\nYOUNG MUSLIMS EVERYWHERE, IN EUROPE, EVEN IN SOME RARE CASES,\nIN THE UNITED STATES. SO HOW TO END THIS?\nTHERE'S REALLY ONLY ONE WAY. HELP THE MAJORITY OF MUSLIMS\nFIGHT EXTREMISTS, REFORM THEIR FAITH, AND MODERNIZE THEIR\nSOCIETIES. IN DOING SO, WE SHOULD LISTEN TO\nTHOSE ON THE FRONT LINES. MANY OF WHOM ARE FIGHTING AND\nDYING IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST JIHADIS, THE HUNDREDS OF MUSLIM\nREFORMERS THAT I'VE SPOKEN TO SAID THEIR TASK IS MADE MUCH\nHARDER WHEN WESTERN POLITICIANS AND PUNDITS CONDEMN ISLAM\nENTIRELY, DEMEAN THEIR FAITH, AND SPEAK OF ALL MUSLIMS AS\nBACKWARD AND SUSPECT. HERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO THINK\nABOUT THIS. IN AMERICA, AFRICAN-AMERICANS\nMAKE UP ABOUT 13% OF THE POPULATION YET THEY COMPRISE\nABOUT 50% OF HOMICIDE OFFENDERS, ACCORDING TO A JUSTICE\nDEPARTMENT STUDY. NOW, WE UNDERSTAND, I HOPE WE\nUNDERSTAND, THAT WHEN WE SEE A BLACK MAN ON THE STREET, WE\nCANNOT, MUST NOT TREAT HIM AS A LIKELY CRIMINAL.\nIT WOULD BE DEHUMANIZING, UNFAIR AND RACIST.\nIN AMERICA OF ALL PLACES, PEOPLE SHOULD BE TREATED AS INDIVIDUALS\nAND NOT AS STEREOTYPES FROM A RACIAL, ETHNIC OR RELIGIOUS\nGROUP. REMEMBER, THE BANGLADESHI CAB\nDRIVER WHO DRIVES YOU TO THE AIRPORT HAS NOTHING, NOTHING TO\nDO WITH ISIS EVEN THOUGH HE IS A MUSLIM.\nIT'S HARD NOT TO MAKE THESE QUICK ASSOCIATIONS, ESPECIALLY\nIN THE WAKE OF A TERROR ATTACK. BUT IF AMERICA IS ABOUT\nANYTHING, IT IS THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE JUDGED AS\nINDIVIDUALS WITH INDIVIDUAL LIBERTIES AND RIGHTS.\nIT IS WHAT THEY HATE ABOUT US. WE MIGHT AS WELL LIVE UP TO OUR\nOWN IDEALS. I'M FAREED ZAKARIA.\nTHANK YOU FOR WATCHING.",

OF THE 30,000 DEAD, THE VAST,\nVAST MAJORITY WERE MUSLIMS, THAT'S CRUCIAL TO UNDERSTAND,\nBECAUSE IT SHEDS LIGHT ON THE QUESTION, WHY DO THEY HATE US?\nISLAMIC TERRORISTS DON'T JUST HATE AMERICA OR THE WEST, THEY\nHATE THE MODERN WORLD, AND THEY PARTICULARLY HATE TRYING TO LIVE\nIN THE MODERN WORLD. LET'S BE CLEAR.\nWHILE THE JIHADIS ARE FEW, THERE IS A LARGER CANCER WITHIN THE\nWORLD OF ISLAM, A CANCER OF EXTREMISM AND INTOLERANCE, MOST\nHAVE LAWS THAT RESTRICT THE FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION OR THE\nMAJORITY. ARE THESE THINGS INHERENT IN THE\nRELIGION? WHEN EXPERTS TRY TO EXPLAIN THAT\nIN THE 14th CENTURY ISLAMIC COUNTY -- THEY'RE NOT TRYING TO\nDENY THE REALTIES OF BACKWARDNESS TODAY, WHAT THEY'RE\nSAYING IS IT CAN CHANGE. ISLAM AFTER ALL HAS BEEN AROUND\nFOR 14 CENTURIES, THERE HAVE BEEN PERIODS OF WAR, BUT ALSO OF\nPEACE. IT'S THE SAME RELIGION THEN AND\nNOW, SO WHAT IS DIFFERENT? IT'S NOT THEOLOGY, IT'S\nPOLITICS. RADICAL ISLAM IS THE PRODUCT OF\nTHE BROKEN POLITICS AND STAGNANT ECONOMICS OF MUSLIM COUNTRIES.\nTHEY HAVE FOUND IN RADICAL RELIGIOUS AN IDEOLOGY THAT LETS\nTHEM RAIL AGAINST THE MODERN WORLD, AN IDEOLOGY THAT'S NOW\nBEING EXPORTED TO ALIENATED YOUNG MUSLIMS EVERYWHERE, IN\nEUROPE, EVEN IN SOME RARE CASES IN THE UNITED STATES.\nSO HOW TO END THIS?

HERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO THINK\nABOUT THIS, IN AMERICA, AFRICAN-AMERICANS MAKE UP ABOUT\n13% OF THE POPULATION, YET THEY COMPRISE ABOUT 50% OF HOMICIDE\nOFFENDERS, ACCORDING TO A JUSTICE DEPARTMENT STUDY.\nNOW WE UNDERSTAND, I HOPE WE UNDERSTAND, THAT WHEN WE SEE A\nBLACK MAN ON THE STREET, WE CANNOT, MUST NOT TREAT HIM AS A\nLIKELY CRIMINAL, IT WOULD BE DEHUMANIZING, UNFAIR, AND\nRACIST. IN AMERICA OF ALL PLACES, PEOPLE\nSHOULD BE TREATED AS INDIVIDUALS AND NOT AS STEREOTYPES FROM A\nRACIAL, ETHNIC OR RELIGIOUS GROUP.\nREMEMBER, THE BANGLADESHI CAB DRIVER WHO DRIVES YOU TO THE\nAIRPORT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ISIS, EVEN THOUGH IT IS ALSO A\nMUSLIM. IT'S HARD NOT TO MAKE THESE\nQUICK ASSOCIATIONS, ESPECIALLY IN THE WAKE OF A TERROR ATTACK.\nBUT IF AMERICA IS ABOUT ANYTHING, IT IS THE IDEA THAT\nPEOPLE SHOULD BE JUDGED WITH INDIVIDUALS WITH INDIVIDUAL\nLIBERTIES AND RIGHTS, IT IS WHAT THEY HATE ABOUT US.\nWE MIGHT AS WELL LIVE UP TO OUR OWN IDEALS.\nI'M FAREED ZAKARIA, THANK YOU",

            "text": ">>> TOP OF THE HOUR, 7:00 P.M.\nEASTERN. SO GLAD YOU'RE WITH US THIS\nSUNDAY EVENING. WE BEGIN WITH POLITICS AND\nDONALD TRUMP. THE DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN\nPUSHING BACK TONIGHT AGAINST REPORTS THAT WE ARE ABOUT TO\nPOSSIBLY SEE A MAJOR SHIFT IN POLICY FROM THE CANDIDATE WHO\nLAUNCHED HIS CAMPAIGN BY PROMISING TO BUILD A WALL WITH\nMEXICO. AND THEN DEPORT MILLIONS OF\nUNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. THE RUMORS THAT TRUMP MAY\nBACKTRACK AND FIND A WAY TO LEGALIZE MANY OF THOSE\nUNDOCUMENTED WORKERS STEMMING FROM A MEETING TRUMP HELD WITH\nHISPANIC SUPPORTERS IN NEW YORK ON SATURDAY.\nHERE'S WHAT HIS CAMPAIGN MANAGER KELLYANNE CONWAY TOLD CNN TODAY.\n>> SO WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAID YESTERDAY IN THAT MEETING\nDIFFERED VERY LITTLE FROM WHAT HE'S SAID PUBLICLY, DANA,\nINCLUDING HIS CONVENTION SPEECH LAST MONTH IN CLEVELAND.\nIT'S THAT WE NEED A, QUOTE, FAIR AND HUMANE WAY OF DEALING WITH\nWHAT IS EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT 11 MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN\nTHIS COUNTRY. NOTHING WAS SAID YESTERDAY THAT\nDIFFERS FROM WHAT MR. TRUMP HAS SAID YESTERDAY.\n>> LET ME PLAY SOMETHING FROM WHAT MR. TRUMP WAS SAID\nPREVIOUSLY. LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID BACK IN\nNOVEMBER. >> WE'LL HAVE A DEPORTATION\nFORCE. YOU'LL DO IT HUMANELY.\n>> WILL THEY GET RIPPED OUT OF THEIR HOMES?\nHOW. >> IF THEY CAME FROM A CERTAIN\nCOUNTRY, THEY'LL BE SENT BACK TO THAT COUNTRY.\nTHAT'S THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.\n>> DOES DONALD TRUMP STILL SUPPORT THAT, A DEPORTATION\nFORCE REMOVING THE 11 MILLION OR SO UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS?\n>> WHAT HE SUPPORTS -- AND IF YOU GO BACK TO THE CONVENTION\nSPEECH A MONTH AGO, DANA, WHAT HE SAID IS THAT WE ENFORCE THE\nLAW, THAT WE'RE RESPECTFUL OF THOSE AMERICANS WHO ARE LOOKING\nFOR WELL-PAYING JOBS AND THAT WE'RE FAIR AND HUMANE FOR THOSE\nWHO LIVE AMONG US IN THIS COUNTRY.\nAS THE WEEKS UNFOLD -- AS THE WEEKS UNFOLD HE'LL LAY OUT THE\nSPECIFICS OF THAT PLAN THAT HE WOULD IMPLEMENT AS PRESIDENT OF\nTHE UNITED STATES. >> WO THAT INCLUDE A DEPORTATION\nFORCE, THE KIND HE TALKED ABOUT THIS THAT SOUND BITE AND DURING\nTHE REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES? >> TO BE DETERMINED.\n>> WHILE TRUMP'S FUTURE SUPPORT OF A DEPORTATION FORCE REMAINED\nTBD, WE DID LEARN MORE ABOUT HIS CAMPAIGN WAR CHEST.\nBRAND-NEW DOCUMENTS FILED WITH THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMITTEE\nFOUND THAT TRUMP ENDED JULY WITH $38 MILLION ON HAND FOR HIS\nCAMPAIGN COMPARED WITH HILLARY CLINTON'S $58 MILLION.\nTODAY TRUMP HAS SPENT $89 MILLION ON THIS RUN FOR THE\nWHITE HOUSE. THAT'S A FRACTION OF THE 268\nMILLION THAT'S BEEN SPENT BY CLINTON.\nA LOT TO DISSECT THIS HOUR. JOINING ME IS OUR PANEL, AMY\nKRAMER AND A. SCOTT BOLDEN IS THE FORMER CHAM OF THE\nWASHINGTON, D.C., DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND A HILLARY CLINTON\nSUPPORTER. THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE.\n>> GOOD EVENING. >> GOOD EVENING TO YOU BOTH.\nAMY, TBD, THAT'S WHAT KELLYANNE CONWAY SAID BUT ALSO THE TRUMP\nCAMP IS SAYING HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING NEW IN THE MEETING WITH\nHISPANIC SUPPORTERS THAT HE HASN'T SAID BEFORE.\nEITHER WAY IT'S CONFUSING. DOES DONALD TRUMP HAVE TO DO A\nBETTER JOB OF EXPLAINING WHERE HE IS ON THIS ISSUE?\n>> I BELIEVE HE'S GOING TO COME OUT WITH AN IMMIGRATION POLICY\nFROM THE REPORTS I'VE HEARD THIS WEEKEND, HE EXPECTS TO COME OUT\nWITH SOMETHING LATER THIS WEEK. AND SO I WOULD WAIT AND DECIDE\nWHAT I THINK ABOUT IT UNTIL, YOU KNOW, HE PUTS OUT WHAT HIS PLAN\nIS. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE NEEDS\nTO DO. HE NEEDS TO TALK TO THE AMERICAN\nPEOPLE ABOUT IT. >> SO HE'S LAGGING IN THE POLLS\nAMONG MINORITIES, RIGHT? WHETHER THE FOX NEWS POLL THAT\nSHOWS HIM 46 POINTS BEHIND CLINTON WHEN IT COMES TO LATINO\nVOTERS IN THIS COUNTRY, WHETHER IT'S THE NBC/\"WALL STREET\nJOURNAL\" POLL THIS SHOWS HIM AT 1% SUPPORT AMONG\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS. WOULD IT BEHOOVE HIM TO ALTER\nHIS DEPORTATION POLICY A BIT TO SAY, I AM GOING TO WORK ON A WAY\nOR A PATH TOWARDS LEGALIZATION FOR SOME OF THESE 11 MILLION\nUNDOCUMENTED WORKERS IN THIS COUNTRY, EVEN IF IT'S NOT\nSOMETHING YOU AGREE WITH, WOULD IT HELP HIM IN THE POLLS?\n>> I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THAT, POPPY.\nI THINK THAT THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT DONALD TRUMP STANDS FIRM\nON HIS POSITIONS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT, YOU\nKNOW, GALVANIZED PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY IS THAT THEY'RE\nCONCERNED ABOUT OUR ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION SITUATION.\nAND THEY WANT IT TO BE DEALT WITH.\nAND THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT DEALT WITH IT IN THE WAY THAT\nPEOPLE WANT IT TO BE DEALT WITH. WE WANT OUR BORDERS SECURE.\nIT'S ESSENTIAL TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY.\n>> TO BE CLEAR, FACT CHECKING, THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS\nSEEN THE DEPORTATION OF A NUMBER OF UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS IN THIS\nCOUNTRY SO MUCH SO THAT THE CIVIL RIGHTS COMMITTEE HAS\nDUBBED PRESIDENT OBAMA DEPORTER IN CHIEF.\nIF WE DO SEE A SOFTENING OF TRUMP'S STANCE ON HOW TO HANDLE\nTHE 11 MILLION PLUS UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS IN THIS COUNTRY, DOES\nTHAT MAKE HILLARY CLINTON MORE VULNERABLE ON THIS ISSUE?\nBECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING SHE'S BEEN HAMMERING HIM AT.\nIF HE CHANGES HIS TUNE, DOES IT MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR HER?\n>> JUST BECAUSE HE CHANGES HIS TUNE DOESN'T MEAN HE'S GOING TO\nDO IT. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND\nEXACTLY WHAT HE BELIEVES IN AND WHAT HE DOESN'T.\nI WILL SAY THIS, IT IS HUGE THAT HIS CAMPAIGN MANAGER, HUGE, WAS\nGIVEN TWO OR THREE OPPORTUNITIES TO SAY HE WOULD DO FORCED\nDEPORTATION AND BUILD THE MEXICAN WALL AND SHE REFUSED TO\nDO IT. SHE SAID TBD.\n>> THE QUESTION WASN'T ABOUT THE WALL.\nHE ALWAYS SAID HE'S GOING TO BUILD A WALL.\n>> THE FORCED DEPORTATION. IT'S HUGE.\nIT WAS ESSENTIAL TO HIS MESSAGE IN THE PRIMARY.\nTHIS WOULDN'T BE A PIVOT. THIS WOULD BE A REVERSAL.\nTHEN HE HAS TO FACE CREDIBILITY ISSUES.\nDOES HE HAVE CREDIBILITY NOW IF HE DOESN'T GO FORWARD WITH THE\nFORCED DEPORTATION WITH THE PEOPLE THAT SUPPORTED HIM OR\nDOES HE TRY TO GET AT BLACKS AND BROWNS AND WHITE EDUCATED\nVOTERS? I THINK THE MESSAGE HAS BEEN\nCLEAR. I THINK THAT THE DIE HAS BEEN\nCAST. I THINK IT'S TOO LATE TO GET\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS AND HISPANICS AND EDUCATED WHITES BACK INTO\nTHE FOLD. THE DIE HAS BEEN CAST.\nSO IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT HE SAYS.\nIT DOESN'T MATTER IF HE SOFTENS HIS POSITION.\n>> YOU'RE SAYING THE DIE HAS BEEN CAST WHEN YOUR CANDIDATE IS\nWAY UP IN THE POLLS IN THE BATTLEGROUND STATES, BUT WE KNOW\nWE'VE GOT 80 DAYS TO GO. WE'LL SEE A LOT MORE AMERICANS\nPAYING VERY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THIS ELECTION AFTER LABOR DAY.\nSO AMY, TO YOU, THOUGH, ON THOSE NUMBERS, IT IS CLEAR THAT DONALD\nTRUMP HAS TO WIN OVER MORE MINORITY VOTERS AND HAS TO GET\nMORE WOMEN ON BOARD IF HE WANTS TO WIN THE WHITE HOUSE.\n>> RIGHT. >> AS HE PREPARES FOR THE DEBATE\nTHIS WEEKEND, WE KNOW HE STARTED THAT PREP THIS WEEKEND, WHAT DO\nYOU WANT TO HEAR HIM SAY ON THE DEBATE STAGE SEPTEMBER 26th TO\nDO THAT? >> I WANT HIM TO TALK ABOUT THE\nPOLICIES AND HIS SOLUTIONS THAT HE'S GOING TO IMPLEMENT IN ORDER\nTO GET OUR ECONOMY GOING AGAIN, TO CREATE JOBS AND TO SECURE OUR\nBORDERS AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE SAFE AS A NATION.\n>> BUT HE'S BEEN DOING THAT, AMY.\nWHAT DIFFERENT THINGS DO YOU WANT TO HEAR?\n>> IMMIGRATION POLICY IS A BIG THING.\nTHAT'S ABOUT OUR NATIONAL SECURITY AND SECURING THE\nBORDERS. THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT I WANT\nTO HEAR. I WANT HIM TO REACH OUT AND\nAPPEAL TO THESE PEOPLE AND TALK ABOUT WHY HE IS GOING TO BE A\nBETTER PRESIDENT THAN BARACK OBAMA OR HILLARY CLINTON WOULD\nBE BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON WILL BE FOUR MORE YEARS OF THE SAME\nOF THIS ADMINISTRATION THAT WE'VE HAD THE PAST EIGHT YEARS.\nAND THAT'S WHAT DONALD TRUMP NEEDS TO ARTICULATE.\nAND I THINK THAT'S WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN\nTRAIL. HE IS OUT THERE, HE'S HELD 24\nEVENTS ALREADY THIS MONTH. AND HE'S CONTINUING TO MEET WITH\nPEOPLE. AS WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE, HE'S\nDOWN IN MISSISSIPPI AND TEXAS REACHING OUT TO PEOPLE.\nTHOSE ARE NOT BATTLEGROUND STATES.\n>> WHY IS HE THERE? WHY IS HE THERE?\nPEOPLE SCRATCHED THEIR HEADS WHEN HE WENT TO CONNECTICUT LAST\nWEEK BECAUSE IT'S SO SOLIDLY BLUE.\nWHY SPEND MONEY DOWN IN, YOU KNOW, IN TEXAS AND MISSISSIPPI?\n>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, BECAUSE NUMBER ONE, THERE'S A LARGE\nHISPANIC AND LATINO POPULATION IN TEXAS.\nWHY NOT REACH OUT TO THEM? SECOND OF ALL, BECAUSE IT'S NO\nSECRET THAT THERE'S BEEN A PROBLEM WITH THE REPUBLICAN\nPARTY AS WELL AS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.\nHE'S TRYING TO BRING THE REPUBLICAN BASE TOGETHER, REACH\nOUT PROBABLY TO SOME OF THOSE TED CRUZ SUPPORTERS, THE\nNEVER-TRUMPERS OUT THERE. AND LOOK, I THINK TED CRUZ\nSAID -- DID EXACTLY WHAT HE DIDN'T INTEND TO DO.\nHE UNIFIED PEOPLE AT THE CONVENTION WHEN HE GOT UP ON\nTHAT CONVENTION STAGE AND DIDN'T ENDORSE DONALD TRUMP.\nBUT TRUMP IS GOING TO TEXAS AND I'M SURE HE'S TRYING TO REACH\nOUT TO THOSE PEOPLE. THERE'S NO PLACE THAT THESE\nCANDIDATES SHOW NOT GO, POPPY. >> SWITCHING GEARS HERE, SCOTT,\nI GOT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THIS WEEK WE LEARNED AT\nTHE END OF THE WEEK THAT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION WILL STOP\nTAKING MONEY FROM FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND FROM\nCORPORATIONS IF HILLARY CLINTON IS ELECTED PRESIDENT AND THAT\nBILL CLINTON WILL NOT GIVE PAID SPEECHES.\nHE HASN'T DONE SO SINCE 2015. BUT TODAY ON \"STATE OF THE\nUNION\" OUR DANA BASH PRESSED CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER ROBBY\nMOOK ON THIS POINT, ON THE DECISION TO NOT STOP THAT\nDONATION FROM FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS NOW OR WHILE SHE WAS\nSECRETARY OF STATE. WHY WAIT UNTIL SHE'S PRESIDENT\nIF SHE WINS. LISTEN.\n>> BUT IF THIS IS THE RIGHT POLICY NOW, WHY NOT DO IT WHEN\nSHE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT? >> THE FOUNDATION IS DOING AN\nENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WORK AND IT TAKES TIME WHEN YOU'RE IN A\nNUMBER OF COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD TO RETOOL, REFOCUS THE\nMISSION AND ADAPT. AS YOU SAID, THEY RECEIVE A\nGREAT DEAL OF FUNDING THROUGH THESE STREAMS",

AMY, SINCE DAY ONE, SINCE WE SAW\nDONALD TRUMP COME DOWN THAT GOLD ESCALATOR AT TRUMP TOWER, HE'S\nBEEN RUNNING ON THIS PLATFORM OF IMMIGRATION, IMMIGRATION,\nIMMIGRATION REFORM, TALKING ABOUT BUILDING A WALL.\nNOW WE HEARD WHAT HIS CAMPAIGN MANAGER SAID TBD ON WHETHER\nHE'LL SOFTEN HIS POSITION. TWO MONTHS FROM THE ELECTION, IS\nIT UNCLEAR WHERE HE STANDS? >> I'M NOT CONCERNED ABOUT IT AT\nALL. I KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN LEAKS\nTHAT HAVE COME OUT OF THESE MEETINGS FROM PEOPLE IN\nATTENDANCE, BUT I WOULDN'T TAKE ANY OF THAT SERIOUSLY UNTIL IT\nCOMES OUT OF MR. TRUMP'S MOUTH. I THINK HE'S GOING TO BE HONEST\nWITH US. THAT'S ONE THING HE SAID LAST\nWEEK IN ONE OF HIS SPEECHES, I WILL ALWAYS TELL YOU THE TRUTH.\nSO I THINK THEY ARE WORKING ON THIS IMMIGRATION PLAN.\nHE KNOWS WHAT THE ISSUES ARE, HE KNOWS WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\nARE CONCERNED ABOUT. I THINK HE'LL COME OUT WITH A\nPLAN AND HE'S GOING TO TELL US EXACTLY WHAT HE INTENDS TO DO.\n>> LET ME ASK YOU ONE QUESTION ON THAT.\nBECAUSE IT'S BECOME VERY CLEAR IN THE LAST WEEK, CNN'S NEW\nBATTLEGROUND MAP SHOWS THIS, THAT EVEN IF HE WERE TO -- EVEN\nIF HILLARY CLINTON WERE TO LOSE EVERY BATTLEGROUND STATE, SHE\nSTILL HAS A PATH TO 173 ELECTORAL VOTES.\nIT'S STILL THAT HE NEEDS WORKING CLASS VOTERS.\nTHIS SCHOOL AT WHARTON AND WHAT IT FORECASTS IS HIS PLAN TO\nDEPORT 11 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS WOULD RESULT IN 4\nMILLION JOB LOSSES FOR THE U.S. ECONOMY BY 2030.\nDO YOU THINK THAT TRUMP IS LOOKING AT NUMBERS LIKE THIS,\nLOOKING AT THE POLLING, LOOKING AT THE REALITY OF THE MAP AND\nSAYING I MAY HAVE TO CHANGE WHAT I SAID BEFORE ON DEPORTING ALL\nOF THOSE IMMIGRANTS? >> WELL, POPPY, I'M NOT FAMILIAR\nWITH THAT EXACTLY STUDY THAT CAME OUT, BUT I KNOW THAT DONALD\nTRUMP IS CONCERNED ABOUT JOBS AND THE ECONOMY BUT HE'S ALSO\nCONCERNED ABOUT OUR SAFETY AND NATIONAL SECURITY AND ABOUT\nPEOPLE UPHOLDING THE LAW. AND WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT IS\nNOT IMMIGRATION, LEGAL IMMIGRANTS.\nWHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.\nJASON CHAFFETZ AND THE HOUSE OVERSITE COMMITTEE HAD A HEARING\nAND HE CITED OUT OF 86 MILLION IMMIGRANTS RELEASED BY ISIS,\nTHEY HAD BEEN CONVICTED OF CRIMES.\n231 CRIMES THAT THEY WERE CONVICTED OF.\nOF 196 OF THOSE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS THAT WERE RELEASED BY\nISIS, 196 OF THEM HAD COMMITTED HOMICIDE AND BEEN CONVICTED OF\nIT. AND THOSE ARE THINGS ALSO THAT\nDONALD TRUMP IS CONCERNED ABOUT. SO THAT'S PART OF BEING A\nCOMMANDER IN CHIEF IS YOU HAVE TO WEIGH THOSE THINGS OUT AND\nYOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A SOLUTION FOR ALL AMERICANS.\nBUT IT'S ABOUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\n>> HOLLY, TO YOU, LET ME BRING YOU IN HERE.\nA NEW CNN POLL THAT WAS TAKEN AEFR BOTH PARTIES' CONVENTIONS\nMORE THAN HALF OF VOTERS THINK THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS A\nBETTER HANDLE ON IMMIGRATION THAN DONALD TRUMP.\nBUT NOW IF TRUMP DOES CHANGE HIS TUNE, IF HE DOES SOFTEN IT, IF\nHE SAYS WE WON'T DEPORT THESE 11 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS,\nWE'LL FIND A PATH, BUT SOMETHING DIFFERENT, DOES THAT MAKE HIM\nMORE APPEALING TO VOTER WHO ARE UNDECIDED RIGHT NOW?\n>> IT DOESN'T MATTER. HE HAS NO SERIOUS PLAN ON\nIMMIGRATION, AS MY COLLEAGUE AMY SAID.\nIT'S STILL TO BE DETERMINED, AS KELLYANNE SAID THIS MORNING.\nWE'RE GOING INTO THE ELECTION WITH A CANDIDATE WHO HAS IMPLIED\nTHAT FOREIGNERS ARE DANGEROUS, WHO HAS IMPLIED THAT MEXICANS\nARE ALL RACISTS. >> HE DIDN'T SAY ALL.\nHE DID NOT SAY ALL. >> AND NOW HE'S PUSHING POLICIES\nTHAT REFLECT THAT VISION, WHETHER IT'S BUILDING A WALL,\nWHICH EVEN RICK PERRY SAYS IS UNREALISTIC.\nSO THAT'S WHERE WE ARE IN THIS ELECTION.\nWE KNOW WHERE DONALD TRUMP STANDS.\nHE'S MADE IT VERY CLEAR. ANYTHING HE DOES TO TRY TO\nCHANGE HIS MIND THIS WEEK I THINK IS ONE, DISINGENUOUS, AND\nSHOULD HAVE BEEN SAID IN PUBLIC AND NOT IN PRIVATE --\n>> WOULD YOU DISAGREE, HOLLY, THAT THIS HAS BEEN A RELATIVELY\nWITH GOOD WEEK FOR DONALD TRUMP COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS THREE\nWEEKS? >> I DON'T THINK THAT THIS HAS\nBEEN A PARTICULARLY GOOD WEEK FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nLIKE YOU SAID, HE'S SPENDING HIS TIME CAMPAIGNING IN TEXAS, IN\nMISSISSIPPI AND STATES THAT SHOULD BE IN THE BAG FOR HIM.\nHE'S THERE BECAUSE HE'S NERVOUS ABOUT THOSE STATES OR BECAUSE\nOTHER REPUBLICANS IN VULNERABLE STATES HAVE CAUSED HIM TO STAY\nAWAY. >> LET ME ASK AMY, WHY IS HE\nDOING THAT? OHIO MAKES SENSE, NEVADA I GET.\nWHY GO TO TEXAS AND MISSISSIPPI? KIND OF LIKE WHEN HE WENT TO\nCONNECTICUT, THIS SOLIDLY BLUE STATE.\nTEXAS AND MISSISSIPPI, THEY HAVEN'T GONE BLUE SINCE '76.\nWHY IS HE SPENDING TIME AND MONEY THERE?\n>> POPPY, I PERSONALLY BELIEVE HE SHOULD BE GOING EVERYWHERE.\nI BELIEVE ALL OF THOSE CANDIDATES -- BOTH OF THOSE\nCANDIDATES -- >> WHY IS THAT SMART CAMPAIGNING\nWHEN IT COMES DOWN TO THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE?\n>> OUT OF THE MONTH OF AUGUST HILLARY CLINTON'S ONLY HELD 11\nEVENTS ON HER SCHEDULE OUT OF THE ENTIRE MONTH OF AUGUST.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS SO FAR HELD 24. I DON'T SEE A PROBLEM WITH IT.\nI THINK HE SHOULD BE GOING THERE AND HE SHOULD BE GOING\nEVERYWHERE THAT HIS BASE AND VOTERS WANT TO HEAR FROM HIM.\nEVERY STATE SHOULD WANT TO HEAR FROM HIM.\nBUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE'S NOT FOCUSING ON THE SWING STATES.\nHE'S CERTAINLY FOCUSES ON THE SWING STATES.\nINSTEAD OF ACCEPTEDING HIS CUR SURROGATES EVERYWHERE.\nDT T IS REACHING OUT AND TRYING TO TOUCH EVERY SINGLE VOTER THAT\nHE POSSIBLY CAN.

WE'LL BEGIN WITH WHAT IS A\nPOTENTIAL SEISMIC SHIFT FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nJUST DAYS BEFORE THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DELIVERS\nA MAJOR SPEECH ON IMMIGRATION, HIS CAMPAIGN IS SIGNALING THAT\nHE MAYBE SOFTENING HIS STANCE ON DEPORTING MILLIONS OF\nUNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. FORCED DEPORTATIONS WERE A MAJOR\nCORNERSTONE OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN BUT NOW THE ISSUE IS,\nQUOTE, TO BE DETERMINED. WE'LL TALK TO CHRIS FRATES IN\nJUST A MOMENT TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHY THIS SHIFT IS A\nCURING AT THIS TIME. IT WAS JUST RECENTLY THAT WE\nHEARD THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS REACHING OUT TO MINORITIES.\nNOW THIS IS A DIFFERENT SHIFT REACHING OUT TO IMMIGRANTS.\nTHE IMPACT IS YET TO BE SEEN. THERE'S CHRIS FRATES.\nCHRIS, WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT THIS REALLY SEISMIC SHIFT\nOR SO IT SOUNDS. WHAT ARE YOU HEARING?\n>> YEAH, WELL, MARTIN, AS YOU POINTED OUT HERE, DONALD TRUMP\nCAMPAIGNED HARD ON THIS PLAN TO DEPORT THE 11 MILLION IMMIGRANTS\nWHO ARE IN THIS COUNTRY ILLEGALLY.\nBUT TODAY KELLYANNE CONWAY SIGNALED TRUMP'S HARDLINE STANCE\nMIGHT BE SOFTENING. HERE'S DANA BASH PRESSING CONWAY\nTHIS MORNING ON \"STATE OF THE UNION.\"\n>> LET ME GET SOME CLARITY BECAUSE YOU WERE AT THIS\nMEETING. DOES DONALD TRUMP STILL SUPPORT\nSETTING UP A DEPORTATION FORCE AND REMOVING THE 11 MILLION OR\nESTIMATED 11 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS FROM\nAMERICA, YES OR NO? >> SO WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAID\nYESTERDAY IN THAT MEETING DIFFERED VERY LITTLE FROM WHAT\nHE SAID PUBLICLY INCLUDING HIS CONVENTION SPEECH LAST MONTH IN\nCLEVELAND. WE NEED A FAIR AND, QUOTE,\nHUMANE WAY OF DEALING WITH WHAT IS ESTIMATED TO BE 11 MILLION\nILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN THIS COUNTRY.\nTHAT WAS PART OF THE DISCUSSION, IT WAS A VERY ROBUST DISCUSSION.\nI'VE SEEN HIM VERY ANIMATED IN MEETINGS LIKE THIS WHERE HE'S\nLEARNING, HE'S TAKING NOTES, HE'S ASKING QUESTIONS, HE'S\nRECEIVING INFORMATION, AND THE REST OF THE CONVERSATION,\nFRANKLY, WAS ABOUT JOB CREATION, ECONOMIC REVITALIZATION, THE\nFACT THAT SMALL BUSINESS GROWTH AMONG HISPANIC AND LATINO\nAMERICANS IS ON THE RISE. WE TALKED ABOUT THE INABILITY TO\nGET ACCESS TO CAPITAL FOR MANY OF THEM, WE TALKED ABOUT HOME\nOWNERSHIP AND FAMILY AND RELIGION BEING VERY IMPORTANT TO\nHISPANICS. A VERY LONG, FAR REACHING\nCONVERSATION. BUT NOTHING WAS SAID YESTERDAY\nTHAT DIFFERS FROM WHAT MR. TRUMP HAS SAID PREVIOUSLY.\n>> LET ME PLAY SOMETHING FROM WHAT MR. TRUMP HAS SAID\nPREVIOUSLY. LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID BACK IN\nNOVEMBER. >> WE NEED TO HAVE A DEPORTATION\nFORCE. YOU'LL DO IT HUMANELY.\n>> WILL THEY BE RIPPED OUT OF THEIR HOMES?\nHOW? >> THEY'LL GO BACK TO A CERTAIN\nCOUNTRY. THAT'S THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO\nBE. >> DOES DONALD TRUMP STILL\nSUPPORT THAT, A DEPORTATION FORCE REMOVING THE 11 MILLION OR\nSO UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS? >> WHAT HE SUPPORTS -- AND IF\nYOU GO BACK TO THE CONVENTION SPEECH A MONTH AGO, DANA, WHAT\nHE SUPPORTS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ENFORCE THE LAW, THAT WE'RE\nRESPECTFUL OF THOSE AMERICANS WHO ARE LOOKING FOR WELL-PAYING\nJOBS AND THAT WE ARE FAIR AND HUMANE FOR THOSE WHO LIVE AMONG\nUS IN THIS COUNTRY. AS THE WEEKS UNFOLD, HE WILL LAY\nOUT THE SPECIFICS OF THAT PLAN THAT HE WOULD IMPLEMENT AS\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. >> WILL THAT PLAN INCLUDE A\nDEPORTATION FORCE, THE KIND THAT HE JUST -- YOU JUST HEARD IN\nTHAT SOUND BITE AND HE TALKED ABOUT DURING THE REPUBLICAN\nPRIMARIES? >> TO BE DETERMINED.\n>> QUESTIONS ABOUT TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION POSITIONS COME AFTER\nA MEETING WITH HISPANIC LEADERS ON SATURDAY WHERE HE REPORTEDLY\nTOLD ATTENDEES HE PLANS TO LEGALIZE MILLIONS OF\nUNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. THAT WOULD BE A HUGE REVERSAL\nFOR TRUMP WHO HAS CAMPAIGNED ON THE IDEA OF CREATING A\nDEPORTATION FORCE THAT WOULD EXPEL UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS\nFROM THE COUNTRY. NOT EVERYONE WHO ATTENDED THAT\nMEETING WALKED AWAY WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT TRUMP'S OPENLY\nGRANTING LEGAL STATUS TO UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS.\nONE MEETING ATTENDEST SAID THAT TRUMP TALKED ABOUT TREATING\nPEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY IN A HUMANE, FAIR AND LEGAL WAY\nBUT HE DIDN'T INTERPRET THAT THAT TRUMP MEANT HE WANTED TO\nGRANT THEM LEGAL STATUS. WE'LL LIKELY HEAR MORE DIRECTLY\nFROM TRUMP HIMSELF IN THE COMING DAYS.\n>> ONE OF THE THINGS IN THAT RESPONSE THERE, TO BE\nDETERMINED, IS AN ODD WAY TO PUT IT.\nYOU MIGHT SAY, TO BE REVEALED. AND TO SAY TO BE DETERMINED\nMEANS WE HAVEN'T FIGURED THAT OUT YET.\nTHAT ISN'T GOOD FOR A PERSON RUNNING FOR OFFICE.\n>> THIS IS STILL PART OF WHAT THE DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS\nPUTTING TOGETHER AND THAT MAYBE THERE WILL BE NEW PLANS UNVEILED\nTHIS WEEK. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WAITING TO\nSEE. CERTAINLY KELLYANNE CONWAY\nMAKING IT CLEAR HE'S STILL TALKING ABOUT HUMANE, FAIR AND\nLEGAL TREATMENT, BUT TO BE DETERMINED STILL LEAVES IT UP IN\nTHE AIR WHETHER TRUMP STILL SUPPORTS HIS DEPORTATION FORCE\nOR WHETHER HE WANTS TO GIVE THEM SOME PATH TO LEGALIZATION.\nFOLKS ON THE RIGHT MIGHT CALL THAT AMNESTY.\nTHIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'LL BE CONTINUING TO WATCH.\nBUT THE CAMPAIGN DOES TELL US THAT THIS WILL BE A WEEK THAT\nDONALD TRUMP WANTS TO FOCUS ON IMMIGRATION.\nWE EXPECT WE'LL HEAR MORE FROM HIM DIRECTLY LATER IN THE WEEK.\n>> WE MIGHT GET GREATER CLARIFICATION.\n>> WHAT CAUSED TRUMP TO SORT OF GO FROM FORCED DEPORTATIONS AND\nA DISCUSSION ON HOW TO TREAT IMMIGRANTS AND IS HE REALLY\nSOFTENING? LET'S BRING IN SENIOR POLITICAL\nANALYST AND SENIOR EDITOR FOR \"THE ATLANTIC\" RON BROWNSTEIN\nAND WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT FOR \"TIME\" MAGAZINE, JANE NEWTON\nSMALL. THERE ARE MANY WAYS THAT PEOPLE\nARE DECIPHERING WHAT THIS MEANS ON THE PART OF DONALD TRUMP.\nLET ME ASK YOU FIRST, WHAT'S YOUR TAKE?\nWHAT'S GOING ON HERE? WHAT'S HE TRYING TO DO?\n>> FIRST, IF HE DID ABANDON THE FACT THAT HE HAD TRUMPETED\nTHROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN OF FORCED DEPORTATION, MASS\nDEPORTATION OF UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS, IT WOULD RANK AMONG\nTHE BIGGEST POLICY REVERSALS OR FLIP-FLOPS FROM THE PRIMARY OF\nGENERAL ELECTION. I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING QUITE\nLIKE IT. IT IS ON A CONCESSION TO REALITY\nTHAT MOST REPUBLICAN EXPERTS HAVE BEEN SKEPTICAL OF THE IDEA\nAND THE COST THAT YOU COULD REALLY IN PRACTICE REMOVE 11\nMILLION PEOPLE FROM THEIR HOMES AND FROM THE U.S. AND IN A PANEL\nI MODERATED IN CLEVELAND, ONE OF THE LEADING HOUSE REPUBLICANS\nSAID THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS LE\nELECTED PRESIDENT AND TRY TO DO IT, THAT THEY WOULD TRY TO STOP\nIT. IT WAS POINTED OUT THAT DURING\nTHE PRIMARIES ONE OF THE EXIT POLLS, ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THEY\nASKED, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO WITH PEOPLE HERE ILLEGALLY, GIVE\nTHEM SOME KIND OF LEGAL STATUS OR DEPORT THEM?\nIN VIRTUALLY EVERY STATE A MAJORITY OF DONALD TRUMP'S\nVOTERS SUPPORTED DEPORTATION. THEY WERE A MAJORITY OF HIS\nVOTERS. SO THIS WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT\nREVERSAL OF A CORNERSTONE OF THE APPEAL THAT HE MADE TO THE\nVOTERS THAT WERE PROPELLED INTO THE NOMINATION.\n>> DO YOU THINK THIS IS TRUE? IS HE CAPABLE OF MAKING THIS\nKIND OF SEISMIC SHIFT OR ARE WE READING THE TEA LEAVES WRONG?\n>> HE'S TRYING TO MAKE A PIVOT TO THE GENERAL ELECTION FINALLY,\nAND IT'S BEEN OBVIOUSLY A LITTLE TOO LATE.\nHE SHOULD HAVE MADE THIS PIVOT BEFORE HIS CONVENTION.\n>> WHERE IS THE PIVOT HERE? WHERE IS HE GOING?\n>> IT REFLECTS ESSENTIALLY THE FACT THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS\nRUN ABOUT $60 MILLION NEGATIVE ADVERTISING AGAINST DONALD TRUMP\nFOR THE LAST TWO MONTHS AND THE MAIN THRUST OF THOSE NEGATIVE\nADS HAVE BEEN HIS POSITION ON IMMIGRATION AND RACE.\nHE SUFFERED IN THE POLLS FOR IT. SO NOW HE'S TRYING TO SOFTEN\nTHOSE POSITIONS NOT JUST WITH THIS COMMENT ABOUT REVERSING\nHIMSELF ON IMMIGRATION BUT ALSO SAYING HE WANTS TO APPEAL TO\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS AND HE'LL WIN 95% OF THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE\nHE SAID THIS  PIVOT HIM TO BROA HIS BASE, WHICH IS A NEEDED\nPIVOT IN A GENERAL ELECTION. CAN YOU PIVOT THAT QUICKLY WITH\nONLY FIVE WEEKS TO GO BEFORE EARLY VOTING STARTS?\n>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. SOME HAVE INTERPRETED WHAT HE'S\nTRYING TO DO IS NOT JUST REACH OUT TO A BROADER MINORITY\nAUDIENCE. HE'S TRYING TO REASSURE THE\nWHITE AUDIENCE HE HAS. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?\n>> I THINK THERE'S A LOT TO THAT.\nBECAUSE THE CONUNDRUM THAT DONALD TRUMP FACES IS THAT THESE\nRACIALLY BARRED MESSAGES AND AGENDA THAT HAVE DRIVEN UP HIS\nUNFAVORABLE RATINGS AMONG MINORITY VOTERS TO UNPRECEDENTED\nHEIGHTS AND LEAVES HIM, AS JAY NOTED, FACING THE PROSPECT OF\nHISTORIC DEFICITS AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND HISPANIC\nVOTER, THE EVIDENCE IS OVERWHELMING THAT'S ALSO HURTING\nHIM WITH WHITE COLLAR WHITE VOTERS.\nTHE CONUNDRUM HE FACES IS WHEN YOU DO THIS BADLY WITH MINORITY\nVOTERS YOU HAVE TO PUSH UP YOUR WHITE VOTE.\nTHE SAME ARGUMENTS THAT DRIVE AWAY THE MINORITY VOTERS ALSO\nWORRY A LOT OF THE WHITE COLLAR WHITE VOTERS.\nHE'S TRAILING IN MOST POLLS AMONG WHITES WITH A COLLEGE\nEDUCATION. THE BIG REASON WHY HE'S TRAILING\nIS BECAUSE THEY VIEW HIM AS RACIALLY DIVISIVE IF NOT RACIST.\nI DO THINK WHETHER THIS WORKS AT ALL WITH HISPANIC OR\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS, A BIG PART OF THE GOAL IS TO REASSURE\nSOME OF THOSE SUBURBAN WHITE COLLAR WHITE VOTERS WHO NOW VIEW\nZ HIM AS A RACE IS, TRYING TO GET THEM TO GIVE HIM ANOTHER\nLOOK. >> WE TALK ABOUT WHETHER H\nCHANGING HIS MESSAGE OR HIS IMAGE.\nIS HE TRYING TO APPEAR THE SOFTER CANDIDATE OR IS HE REALLY\nGOING TO CHANGE HIS STANCE ON THIS IMAGE, WHICH IS IT?\n>> HE'S DEFINITELY TRYING TO APPEAR AS A SOFTER, KINDER\nCANDIDATE. IF ANYONE KNOWS FEMALE VOTERS,\nIT'S KELLYANNE CONWAY. SHE WROTE THE BOOK ABOUT TEN\nYEARS AGO. SHE'S TRYING TO SEND AN APPEAL",

DOES DONALD TRUMP STILL SUPPORT\nTHE DEPORTATION FORCE AND REMOVING 11 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED\nIMMIGRANTS FROM AMERICA? YES OR NO?\n>> WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAID YESTERDAY IN THAT MEETING\nDIFFERED VERY LITTLE FROM WHAT HE SAID PUBLICLY INCLUDING IN\nHIS CONVENTION SPEECH LAST MONTH IN CLEVELAND.\nIS THAT WE NEED A QUOTE, FAIR, AND QUOTE, HUMANE WAY, OF\nDEALING WITH WHAT IS ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT 11 MILLION ILLEGAL\nIMMIGRANTS IN THIS COUNTRY. THAT WAS PART AFTER VERY ROBUST\nDISCUSSION, I'VE SEEN HIM ANIMATED IN MEETINGS WHERE HE IS\nLEARNING, TAKING NOTES, ASKING QUESTIONS, RECEIVING\nINFORMATION. AND THE REST OF THE CON VIR SAGS\nFRANKLY WAS ABOUT JOB CREATION, ECONOMIC REVITALIZATION, THE\nFACT SMALL BUSINESS GROWTH AMONG HISPANIC AND LATINO AMERICANS IS\nON THE RISE. WE TALKED ABOUT THE INABILITY TO\nGET ACCESS TO CAPITAL. FOR MANY OF THEM WE TALKED ABOUT\nHOMEOWNERSHIP HAS BEING VERY IMPORTANT, RELIGION AND FAMILY\nBEING VERY IMPORTANT TO HISPANICS.\nVERY LONG, VERY FAR-REACHING CONVERSATION BUT NOTHING SAID\nYESTERDAY DIFFERES FROM WHAT MR. TRUMP SAID PREVIOUSLY.\n>> LET ME PLAY WHEN A SAID IN NOVEMBER.\n>> THEY WILL RIPPED OUT OF THEIR HOMES?\n>> THEY ARE GOING BACK WHERE THEY CAME.\nIF THEY CAME FROM A CERTAIN COUNTRY THEY WILL BE BROUGHT\nBACK TO THAT COUNTRY.

THAT WOULD BE A SHARP CONTRAST\nFROM ONE OF TRUMP'S CENTRAL THEMES ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION\nAND JUST YESTERDAY HELD A CLOSED-DOOR MEETING WITH A\nHISPANIC ADVISORY COUNCIL AND HE TALKED ABOUT A HUMANE AND\nEFFICIENT WAY TO WORK WITH UNDOCUMENTED ILL GRANTS.\nFOR MORE ON THIS, I'M JOINED WITH KEVIN PAUL SCOTT, AND ALSO\nWE J JOINING US, I WASN'T SURE, IS HILLARY CLINTON SUPPORTER\nCRYSTAL BALL. THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.\nLET ME BE CLEAR, WE SAY TRUMP SUPPORTER.\nYOU WANT TO ADD AN AADDENDUM? >> WELL, I WILL SUPPORT THE\nNOMINEE. BUT WE SEE HIM PIVOTING FROM A\nTOUGH FEW WEEKS. HE IS SHOOTING FROM THE HIP,\nCAMPAIGN TROUBLES, IT IS NOT A CAMPAIGN THAT'S EASY TO SUPPORT\nRIGHT NOW. >> LET ME NAIL YOU DOWN ON THE\nIMMIGRATION ISSUE AND WHETHER OR NOT TRUMP IS TRULY CHANGING.\nTHAT WOULD BE WORRISOME TO SOME CORE SUPPORTERS.\n>> YEAH. THERE IS A LOT OF THINGS THAT\nARE WORRISOME WHEN IT COMES TO IS HE REALLY GOING TO SUPPORT\nEXACTLY WHEN A SAID OR IS HE PUTTING ON A SHOW FOR A PUBLIC\nAND PRIMARY VOTERS THAT HE IS WILLING TO SHIFT IN THE GENERAL\nELECTION AND EVEN MORE SCARY IS HE GOING TO SHIFT IF HE WERE TO\nACTUALLY BE ELECT SFLED. >> WHAT IS HE DOING WITH\nIMMIGRATION? >> I THINK ON IMMIGRATION WHAT\nHE IS DOING IS TAKING A DIFFERENT TONE AND WHEN IT COMES\nTO DEPORTATION, THE THING THAT TRUMP IS COMMITTED TO IS THE\nWALL. WE HAVEN'T HEARD A LOT ABOUT IT\nLATELY BUT IS HE GOING TO BUILD THE WALL?\nI THINK THAT'S WHAT HARD-CORE SUPPORTERS ARE LOOKING FOR.\nON THE THINGS THEY SEE AS MAJOR ISSUES, IS HE GOING TO DO THAT\nAND IS HE GOING TO SHIFT ON OTHER THINGS?\nHOW HE OUTREACH ANSWERS COORDINATES OUTREACHES THIS\nGROUP IS INTERESTING. OUTREACH FOR AMERICANS WAS TOUGH\nLAST WEEK. >> IT WAS.\nCRYSTAL BALL, LET ME BRING KNEW THIS CONVERSATION.\n>> YES. >> WHAT WOULD A SHIFT LIKE THIS\nBE? IF DONALD TRUMP IS SOMEHOW\nCHANGING WHAT HAD BEEN ONE OF THE SOLID PILL EARS OF HIS\nCAMPAIGN, HOW WOULD THIS IMPACT HILLARY CLINTON?\n>> OBVIOUSLY I THINK HE HAS REALIZED THAT HE CANNOT WIN THE\nWAY THAT HE IS GOING. AND IN PARTICULAR ONE THING I\nWANTED TO NOTE HERE IS I THINK THAT OUTREACH TO\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS, OUTREACH IT LATINOS IS NOT ABOUT WINNING\nOVER SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF THOSE GROUPS BECAUSE THE DAMAGE\nTHERE IS ALREADY DONE. I DON'T THINK DONALD TRUMP WILL\nGET MUCH MORE WITH AFRICAN-AMERICANS THAN THE 2% HE\nIS REGISTERING IN POLLS RIGHT NOW.\nWHAT IT IS AIMED AT THOUGH AND I THINK THAT YOU SEE THE\nFINGERPRINT OF KELLYANNE CONWAY HERE IS THAT WINNING OVER THE\nREPUBLICAN WOMEN WHO LEFT HIM BECAUSE THEY ARE INCOMFORTABLE\nWITH THIS WHITE NATIONALIST REALLY IN SOME PLACES, RHETORIC\nTHEY SEE COMING OUT OF THE CAMPAIGN, THEY CAN'T ASSOCIATE\nTHEMSELVES WITH A CANDIDATE WHO FEELS TO THEM BLATANTLY RACIST\nAND TONE DEAF. THAT'S HOW IT AFFECTS HILLARY\nCLINTON. SHE HAS DONE A LOT TO MAKE SURE\nSHE IS SPEAKING THOSE MODERATE REPUBLICANS THAT ARE\nUNCOMFORTABLE WITH DONALD TRUMP AND SAYING, LOOK, YOU MAY NOT\nAGREE WITH ME ON ANYTHING BUT YOU CAN TRUST ME AS A GOOD\nSTEWARD OF THE GOVERNMENT. THIS OTHER GUY IS UNHINGED,\nDIDN'T HAVE THE TEMPERAMENT TO BE PRESIDENT AND DOESN'T HAVE\nTHE BEHAVIOR TO BE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.\n>> SO THOSE NOT SO MUCH CONCERNED WITH IMMIGRATION BUT\nUNCOMFORTABLE WITH DONALD TRUMP ON OTHER ISSUES.\nYOU BUY THAT? >> WELL THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT\nHILLARY IS TRYING TO EXPAND THE PLAYING FIELD.\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT DONALD TRUMP'S AD BUY, IT DOESN'T INCLUDE\nVIRGINIA. THAT'S SCARY FOR REPUBLICANS.\nTHEY NEED TO BE COMPETING IN THESE PLACES.\nI DO BUY A LITTLE BIT OF THE ARGUMENT HE IS TRYING TO WIN\nBACK SOME OF THE BASE BUT I DON'T THINK HE WILL STOP THERE.\nWHEN HE TALKS ABOUT AFRICAN-AMERICANS OR HISPANICS\n, HE IS GOING TO MAKE A RUN\nBECAUSE HE NEEDS TO EAT INTO THE MARGINS AT LEAST A LITTLE BIT TO\nHAVE ANY SHOT AT BEING COMPETITIVE THIS FALL.\nI THINK HE WILL BRING BACK HIS BASE AND COMMAND THE PLAYING\nFIELD. >> TRUMP IS NOT GOING TO RELEASE\nTAX RETURNS. EVEN THOUGH THAT SHE HERSELF\nCALLED ON HIM TO DO SO IN PAST, AND TAKE A LISTEN TO THIS.\n>> BACK IN APRIL YOU SAID ON CNN YOU WANT TRUMP TOBE TRANSPARENT.\nLET'S LISTEN. >> BETWEEN JOHN KASICH AND TED\nCRUZ, THIS ALLIANCE THAT DONALD TRUMP IS CALLING COLLUSION, IS\nTHIS FAIR GAME? >> OF COURSE IT'S FAIR GAME.\nIT IS COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT. DONALD TRUMP'S TAXES AREN'T.\nI WOULD LIKE TO SEE THOSE BE TRANSPARENT.\n>> NOW YOU'RE IN CHARGE OF DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN.\nGIVEN THAT AND HOW YOU FEEL, ARE WE GOING TO SEE DONALD TRUMP'S\nTAX RETURNS SOON? >> SO NOW THAT I'M ON THE INSIDE\nI KNOW SOMETHING I DIDN'T KNOW THEN WHICH IS HE IS UNDER AUDIT\nAND WHAT THAT MEANS. HE HAS SAID CLEARLY AND I BACK\nHIM UP COMPLETELY THAT WHEN THE AUDIT IS COMPLETE HE WILL\nRELEASE THE TAX RETURNS. >> I GOT TO SAY, THAT ANSWER\nFLOORED ME.

IF THEY CAME FROM A CERTAIN\nCOUNTRY THEY'LL BE BROUGHT BACK TO THEIR COUNTRY.\nTHAT'S THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.\n>> DOES HE STILL SUPPORT THAT? REMOVING THE 11 MILLION OR SO\nUNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS? >> WHAT HE SUPPORTS -- IF YOU GO\nBACK TO HIS CONVENTION SPEECH A MONTH AGO, DANA, HE SUPPORTS\nMAKING SURE THAT WE ENFORCE THE LAW, THAT WE ARE RESPECTFUL OF\nTHOSE AMERICANS WHO ARE LOOKING FOR WELL-PAYING JOBS AND THAT WE\nARE FAIR AND HUMANE FOR THOSE WHO LIVE AMONG US IN THIS\nCOUNTRY. AS THE WEEKS UNFOLD, AS THE\nWEEKS UNFOLD, HE WILL LAY OUT THE SPECIFICS OF THAT PLAN THAT\nHE WOULD IMPLEMENT AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\n>> WILL THAT PLAN INCLUDE A DEPORTATION FORCE, THE KIND THAT\nHE JUST -- YOU JUST HEARD IN THE SOUND BITE AND THAT HE TALKED\nABOUT DURING THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES?\n>> TO BE DETERMINED. >> OKAY.\nLET'S TALK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS.\nBACK IN APRIL YOU SAID ON CNN THAT YOU WANT TRUMP TO BE\nTRANSPARENT.

WE CAN'T IMAGINE GOING UP\nAGAINST A LESS TRANSPARENT, LESS ACCOUNTABLE, MORE SORT OF RIGGED\nAND CORRUPT INDIVIDUAL AS OUR POLITICAL OPPONENT THAN HILLARY\nCLINTON. SHE HAS HAD A TERRIBLE WEEK WHEN\nIT COMES TO BEING TRANSPARENT AND ACCOUNTABLE.\nWHETHER IT'S THE REVELATIONS OF THE PAY FOR PLAY AT THE -- IN\nTHE STATE DEPARTMENT THAT I KNOW THAT YOU -- CNN IS VERY MUCH ON\nTOP OF AND YOUR REPORTING IS, DANA.\nAS WELL AGS WHAT HAPPENED AT TH CLINTON FOUNDATION.\n>> AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THAT FOR SURE.\nBUT IN THIS PARTICULAR INTERVIEW AND THESE QUESTIONS ARE ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP.

SO WOULD YOU RELEASE THOSE TAX\nRETURNS? >> NO, I WOULD NOT.\nAND THIS ENTIRE TAX RETURN DEBATE IS SOMEWHAT CONFOUNDING\nTO ME IN THE FOLLOWING SENSE. I DON'T THINK THAT IT CREATES\nONE JOB, GETS ONE MORE INDIVIDUAL WHO DOES NOT HAVE\nHEALTH INSURANCE COVERED BY HEALTH INSURANCE, PARTICULARLY\nUNDER THE DISASTER THAT HAS BEEN OBAMA CARE WITH THE PRIVATE\nINSURERS PULLING OUT AND REPORTING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF\nLOSSES. I THINK WHAT PEOPLE ARE\nCONCERNED ABOUT IS HOW WOULD A PRESIDENT TRUMP OR HOW WOULD A\nPRESIDENT HILLARY AFFECT THEIR TAX BILL.\nEVERYDAY LIFE IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY UNAFFORDABLE FOR\nAMERICANS AND THEY DESERVE THE RELIEF HE LAID OUT IN HIS\nSPEECH. IF WE WANT TRANSPARENCY AND\nSPECIFICS, THE MOST RELEVANT THING PEOPLE CAN LOOK AT IS WHAT\nIS HIS PLAN FOR THEIR TAX BILL TO MAKE AFFORDABILITY, JOB\nSECURITY AND REBUILDING THE AMERICAN ECONOMY, WHETHER IT'S\nENERGY BASED, BRINGING BACK MANUFACTURING GOVERNOR PENCE HAS\nACCOMPLISHED ON HIS WATCH.

IT'S AN EXECUTIVE ORDER.\nTHE STATE DEPARTMENT IS IN CHARGE OF EVACUATION PLANS, NOT\nONLY FOR CIVILIAN CONTRACTORS THAT ARE WORKING WITH THE D.O.D.\nBUT FOR ALL CIVILIANS WORKING IN HOT ZONES.\nTHOSE ARE AREAS LIKE UNDER GREAT DURESS, LIKE AFGHANISTAN, LIKE\nWE'VE SEEN IN IRAQ, LIKE WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER PLACES LIKE LIBYA\nAND BENGHAZI. IT IS MANDATED BY EXECUTIVE\nORDER THAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAVE A PLAN IN PLACE TO EVACUATE\nTHESE PERSONNEL IF SOMETHING GOES SOUTH, IF SOMETHING GOES\nWRONG. THE GENTLEMAN THAT WAS SPEAKING\nHEADS THE CRISIS ADVISORY SUBCOMMITTEE IN KABUL FOR WHO?\nFOR THE STATE DEPARTMENT. SO HE'S COMING ON THE RECORD\nSAYING, LOOK, WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING WE CAN.\nWE HAVE TRIED TALKING TO THEM AT THE EMBASSY.\nWE'VE TRIED TALKING TO THEM HERE IN THE STATES AND NOBODY HAS\nSHOWN US AN EVACUATION PLAN FOR THE PERSONNEL INSIDE\nAFGHANISTAN. >> PRETTY UPSETTING.\nA LOT OF THESE CONTRACTORS ARE FORMER U.S. MILITARY, PATRIOTIC\nAMERICANS. GOOD PEOPLE.\n1600 HAVE BEEN KILLED SINCE THE WAR BEGAN IN AFGHANISTAN IN LATE\n2001. WHY EXACTLY DO YOU THINK THE\nU.S. GOVERNMENT ISN'T FOCUSING ON THIS?\n>> WELL, AND JUST TO ADD TO THAT, SEVERAL DAYS AFTER MY\nSTORY BROKE CRS, A CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE REPORT CAME OUT\nTHAT SAID THERE ARE 29,000 U.S. CONTRACTORS IN AFGHANISTAN\nCOMPARED TO WHAT'S GOING TO BE 8300 --\n>> WHOA. >> YES, 8300 MILITARY PERSONNEL\nBY THE END OF THE YEAR. 83, 8400 BY THE END OF THE YEAR.\nSO THINK ABOUT THAT. THOSE NUMBERS, TENS OF THOUSANDS\nOF CONTRACTORS. AND THEY DON'T HAVE AN\nEXPLANATION. WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT ONE OF\nTHE CONTRACTORS THAT I SPOKE WITH ON THE RECORD SAID THEY DID\nSEE A VERY ABYSMAL PLAN LATE LAST YEAR AND THAT VERY HIGH\nLEVEL STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS IN AFGHANISTAN WERE SUPER\nCONCERNED ABOUT THIS, BUT NOBODY GOT ANYTHING DONE.\nSO THERE REALLY IS NO REASON WHY THEY SHOULDN'T HAVEDONE.\nTHEY HAVE THE PEOPLE AND THE MAN POWER IN PLACE TO PREPARE FOR AN\nEVACUATION PLAN AND TO SHARE THOSE EVACUATION PLANS WITH THE\nPEOPLE THAT NEED TO KNOW. >> 29,000.\nTHERE'S A LOT GOING ON THAT THE AVERAGE AMERICAN DOESN'T KNOW\nABOUT. >> THAT'S RIGHT.\n>> THANKS A LOT FOR BRINGING THIS STORY TO US.\nI APPRECIATE IT.",

I THINK ONE OF THE SMARTEST\nMEMBERS OF THE SENATE. THAT WILL BE INTERESTING.\n>> ANYTIME A SENATOR WALKS IN HERE --\n>> ALL RISE. >> WE GET A LITTLE MORE STUDIOUS\nOR. OUR POSTURE GETS BETTER.\n>> WE CLEAN UP THINGS AROUND HERE.\nWE WANTED TO GET RIGHT TO THIS FOX NEWS ALERT.\nWE BEGIN AN APPARENT TERROR ATTACK TARGETING A WEDDING IN  .\nAT LEAST 50 PEOPLE ARE DEAD AND IF ISIS IS, INDEED, RESPONSIBLE,\nIT WOULD BE THE DEADLIEST EXTREMIST ATTACK IN 2016.\n>> WE'RE LIVE IN WASHINGTON WITH THE LATEST ON THIS UNFOLDING\nSTORY. GOOD MORNING LEYLAND.\n>> GOOD MORNING. THIS ATTACK REALLY HIGHLIGHTS\nTHE DANGER AND INSTABILITY RIGHT NOW INSIDE OF TURKEY.\nYOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE BOMBING SCENE THAT STRUCK OVERNIGHT.\nTHIS WAS A WEDDING THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SOMETHING THAT\nWAS ALL SO HAPPY AND TURNED ALL SO TRAGIC.\nWHERE THIS OCCURRED IS AWFULLY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT\nIT, RIGHT ON THE SYRIAN BORDER. A PLACE THAT HAD BEEN USED BY\nEXTREMISTS AND BY WANNABE TERRORISTS ALL THE TIME TO GO\nBACK AND FORTH IN AND OUT OF TURKEY.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE RIGHT NOW ARE SAYING THAT WHAT TURKEY ALLOWED\nFOR SO MANY YEARS IN THE RISE OF ISIS AND TURNING A BLIND EYE TO\nISIS, WELL, NOW THAT IS WHAT IS COMING BACK INTO THEIR COUNTRY.\nISIS HASN'T CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY, BUT ALL SIGNS\nPOINT TO THAT TERROR GROUP. REMEMBER, IT WAS JUST LAST MONTH\nINSIDE TURKEY THAT THE MILITARY ATTEMPTED A COUP, TRIED TO TAKE\nOVER THE COUNTRY FROM THE PRESIDENT SAYING IT HAD BECOME\nTOO ISLAMIC. THAT COUP FAILED AND NOW MANY\nARE SAYING THE INSTABILITY INSIDE TURKEY IS WHAT IS\nALLOWING ATTACKS LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN.\nGUYS, BACK TO YOU. >> I HATE WE KEEP HAVING TO\nREPORT ON THESE TYPE OF STORIES. THANK YOU SO MUCH.\n>> WE WANT TO GET IT OVER TO TUCKER CARLSON WITH SENATOR JEFF\nSESSIONS. >> WE HAVE A LOT GOING ON.\nWE THOUGHT WHAT BETTER PERSON TO RESPOND TO A LOT OF IT THAN\nSENATOR JEFF SESSIONS OF ALABAMA.\nGREAT TO SEE YOU THIS MORNING. >> THANK YOU, TUCKER.\n>> YOU JUST SAW THE TAPE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN TURKEY.\nTURKEY HAS BEEN A MODERATE, PRETTY RELIABLE U.S. ALLY FOR A\nLONG TIME. ARE YOU WORRIED THINGS ARE\nMOVING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION? >> WELL, TURKEY DOES SEEM TO BE\nSLIDING TO A MORE ISLAMIST IDEOLOGY AND THAT'S VERY\nDANGEROUS AND I HOPE IT DOESN'T CONTINUE.\nTHIS ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO ANYTHING TO STOP THAT\nSLIDE, SO IT CAUSES A PROBLEM. THEY DO HAVE THREATS LIKE YOU\nSEE IN THESE BOMBINGS, AND TURKEY HAS BEEN A GREAT ALLY.\nHAVING TURKEY MOVE IN THE WRONG DIRECTION IS REALLY PROBLEMATIC,\nAND WE NEED TO CONTINUE THAT GOOD RELATIONSHIP WE'VE HAD FOR\nMANY DECADES. >> YEAH, THAT WOULD BE A\nMASSIVE, MASSIVE PROBLEM FOR THE UNITED STATES.\nSO BUZZ FEED, WHICH IS A FASHION BLOG THAT HAS A NEWS COMPONENT\nTO IT, HAD A HEADLINE THIS MORNING SAYING IN EFFECT, DONALD\nTRUMP HAS CHANGED COURSE COMPLETELY ON IMMIGRATION.\nHE'S NO LONGER FOR DEPORTATION. IT WAS A STORY ABOUT A MEETING\nHE HAD THE OTHER DAY WITH HISPANIC SUPPORTERS.\nIS THAT TRUE? HAS HE CHANGED HIS VIEW ON\nDEPORTATION? >> HE'S NOT CHANGED HIS VIEW,\nBUT HE HAD A GREAT MEETING WITH PEOPLE WHO HAD DIFFERENT IDEAS\nAND I WASN'T THERE, BUT HE HAD A GOOD DISCUSSION.\nHE LISTENED TO ALL THE DIFFERENT VIEWS.\nLOOK, WE NEED A LAWFUL SYSTEM OF IMMIGRATION.\nTRUMP IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR AND CORRECT ON THAT.\nWE MUST END THE LAWLESSNESS FIRST.\nWE CAN'T TALK ABOUT THESE OTHER ISSUES UNTIL THAT OCCURS.\nI THINK THAT REMAINS HIS FIRM POSITION.\n>> SO THAT ANYWHERE BETWEEN 10 TO 12 MILLION PEOPLE HERE\nILLEGALLY, WHATEVER THE NUMBER. TRUMP HAS SUGGESTED THEY WOULD\nBE REQUIRED TO PHYSICALLY LEAVE THE UNITED STATES, REAPPLY IN\nORDER TO COME BACK LEGALLY. IS THAT --\n>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW THAT HE'S FORMALLY SAID THAT.\nHE DISCUSSED THAT. >> YES.\n>> OTHER PEOPLE HAVE DISCUSSED THAT.\nTHAT'S THE TOUCHBACK IDEA. >> YES.\n>> I'M NOT SURE THAT'S THE BEST SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM, BUT\nIT'S ONE SOLUTION. >> WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE BEST\nSOLUTION? >> WELL, I THINK WE HAVE TO\nFIRST END ALL THE LAWLESSNESS. THIS CAN BE DONE, TUCKER.\nIT'S VERY ACCOMPLISHABLE WITH A STRONG PRESIDENT.\nWE NEED A FEW LAWS WOULD HELP, BUT ACTUALLY YOU COULD DO IT\nWITH CURRENT LAWS. AND THAT'S -- THEN YOU BEGIN TO\nTALK MORE APPROPRIATELY ABOUT WHAT TO DO WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE\nBEEN HERE A LONG TIME. >> SO WHAT ABOUT LEGAL\nIMMIGRATION? WE'VE GOT OVER A MILLION\nLOW-WAGE, LOW-SKILLED WORKERS COMING IN EVERY YEAR INTO AN\nECONOMY THAT CLEARLY CAN'T SUPPORT THEM.\nWOULD TRUMP CHANGE THAT? >> WE'VE GOT TO CONSIDER THAT. CANADA HAS A GREAT SYSTEM WHERE\nTHEY EVALUATE PEOPLE, THEY RATE THEM, THEY GIVE THEM POINTS FOR\nTHINGS THAT ARE GOOD FOR CANADA. AN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM SHOULD\nMEET THE INTERESTS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\nWE NEED TO BRING IN PEOPLE WITH HIGHER SKILLS.\nWE SHOULD LOOK FOR PEOPLE WHO LOVE AMERICA AND VALUE OUR\nVALUES AND WANT TO BE A PART OF THAT, PEOPLE WHO LEARNED ENGLISH\nBEFORE THEY COME SHOULD GET A PREFERENCE OVER PEOPLE WHO CAN'T\nSPEAK THE LANGUAGE. THERE ARE SO MANY RATIONAL\nTHINGS THAT ABSOLUTELY NEED TO BE DONE AS PART OF AN\nIMMIGRATION REFORM THAT I TOTALLY THINK THIS COUNTRY IS\nREADY TO DISCUSS. >> IF YOU RAN YOUR OFFICE OR\nYOUR COMPANY THE WAY WE RUN OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM, JUST LIKE\nGIVING THE FIRST 100 SLOTS TO THE FIRST 100 PEOPLE WHO SHOWED\nUP, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO YOUR COMPANY?\n>> IT JUST MAKES NO SENSE. IT ABSOLUTELY MAKES NO SENSE.\nWE'VE GOT TO FIX THIS. WE CAN DO IT.\nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL SUPPORT IT, BUT WE HAVE POLITICIANS,\nPARTICULARLY DEMOCRATIC LEADERS AND HILLARY CLINTON THAT THEY\nWANT TO GIVE IMMEDIATE AMNESTY TO EVERYBODY, ALLOW THEM ACCESS\nTO EVERY BENEFIT IN AMERICA, AND THEN THEY DON'T WANT TO DO THE\nTHINGS NECESSARY TO GAIN CONTROL OF IMMIGRATION.\nSO THIS IS THE SITUATION THAT'S UNTENABLE.\nIT'S EXTREME. SHE'S TO THE LEFT OF PRESIDENT\nOBAMA. >> BIG TIME.\n>> BIG TIME. IT'S JUST AMAZING REALLY.\n>> SO I LOOK AT THE POLLS EVERY DAY OF THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE,\nGETTING PRETTY CLOSE TO ELECTION DAY REALLY, AND IT LOOKS BAD FOR\nDONALD TRUMP, AND YET I HEAR A LOT OF HIS SUPPORTERS SAY THOSE\nPOLLS AREN'T REAL. ARE THEY REAL?\nIS THERE AN APPRECIATION WITHIN THE CAMPAIGN THAT IT'S NOT ON\nTHE RIGHT COURSE AT PRESENT? >> WELL, POLLS ARE DIFFERENT.\n\"THE LOS ANGELES TIMES\" POLL HAS HIM UP NATIONWIDE.\nTHIS IS A CLOSE RACE RIGHT NOW. WHEN I RAN FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL\nIN ALABAMA THE FIRST TIME I WAS DOWN 14 POINTS IN SEPTEMBER AND\nWON BY 17. PRESIDENT BUSH IN 1988 WAS DOWN\n15 POINTS AT THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION AND WON\nOVERWHELMINGLY, EVERY STATE BUT MASSACHUSETTS AGAINST DUKAKIS.\nSO THIS IS SO FAR TO GO. DONALD TRUMP IS JUST NOW\nBEGINNING TO DRIVE HIS MESSAGE WITH THESE GREAT SPEECHES.\nHE'S SHOWING PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP AND THE FLOOD VICTIMS\nIN LOUISIANA. I THINK THIS CAMPAIGN IS JUST\nBEGINNING TO TAKE OFF. DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO WIN\nTHIS ELECTION. >> SO WHAT'S HIS PITCH TO BLACK\nVOTERS IF YOU COULD BOIL IT DOWN?\n>> THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. HE'S SAYING THAT THE AGENDA\nWE'VE SEEN IN THE BIG CITIES AND OUT OF WASHINGTON FOR THE LAST\n30 YEARS HAVE NOT HELPED YOU, WHICH IS CORRECT.\nTHEY HAVE NOT. YOU BRING IN MORE WORKERS THAN\nWE HAVE JOBS FOR, WHAT DOES THAT DO TO WAGES AND JOB PROSPECTS\nFOR STRUGGLING AFRICAN-AMERICANS WHO WOULD LIKE TO RISE?\nI MEAN, YOU JUST PULLED DOWN WAGES AND YOU PULL DOWN JOBS,\nAND WHEN YOU DO A TRADE POLICY, TUCKER, THAT KILLS\nMANUFACTURING, ELIMINATES HIGH-PAYING JOBS, THAT HURTS OUR\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND HISPANIC COMMUNITIES TOO.\nWE NEED A LEADER THAT CAN CHANGE THIS ECONOMY, GET US ON THE\nRIGHT PATH, END LAWLESSNESS AND IMMIGRATION, FIX OUR TRADE\nPOLICY SO THAT WE CAN HAVE STRONGER MANUFACTURING BASE AND\nBETTER JOBS. THAT WILL BE THE BEST THING\nPOSSIBLE FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS --\n>> BUT HAS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY BEEN PRETTY GOOD THAT CONVINCING\nBLACK VOTERS ALL NONWHITE VOTERS ARE IN THIS TOGETHER.\nTHAT THEY'RE ON THE SAME TEAM SOMEHOW?\n>> IT IS SORT OF AMAZING. IN MY VIEW WE HAVE AS GOVERNMENT\nLEADERS AN ABSOLUTE RESPONSIBILITY TO THE PEOPLE WHO\nARE HERE LAWFULLY IMMIGRATED OR BORN, NATIVE BORN.\nTHAT'S THE FIRST THING. THE IDEA THAT YOU WOULD BRING IN\nMORE WORKERS TO TAKE JOBS WHILE AMERICANS ARE UNEMPLOYED HAVING\nTO GO ON WELFARE IS LUDICROUS. IT MAKES NO SENSE, TUCKER, AND I\nTHINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE GET IT BUT THAT'S --\n>> WHAT'S THE REASON FOR IT? >> THAT'S THE POLICY OF THE\nOBAMA AND CLINTON ADMINISTRATION.\n>> I BET IF YOU POLLED A THOUSAND PEOPLE AND ASKED SHOULD\nWE BRING IN MORE WORKERS THAN WE ARE CREATING JOBS OR WHILE\nAMERICANS ARE UNEMPLOYED, THEY WOULD SAY NO, AND YET IT\nPERSISTS. THAT'S OUR OFFICIAL POLICY.\nWHAT'S THE MOTIVE BEHIND IT? >> THERE'S SEVERAL MOTIVES.\nFIRST, THERE'S A DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL AGENDA AT WORK AND\nTHEN THERE'S A BUSINESS AGENDA AT WORK HERE.\nBUSINESSES WANT MORE WORKERS AT LOWER WAGES.\nTHAT'S WHAT THEY DO. I MEAN, THAT'S THE NATURE OF\nTHEIR BEAST. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT POLITICIANS\nSHOULD LOOK AT. IF YOU'RE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT\nOF THE UNITED STATES, YOU WANT WAGES TO GO UP, NOT DOWN.\nGIVE ME A BREAK. BUSINESSES WOULD LIKE TO SEE\nMORE WORKERS IN LOWER WAGES. THAT'S JUST THE NATURE OF THE\nBEAST. >> DONALD TRUMP ARTICULATED THAT\nCLEARLY, I THINK HE'D WIN 55%, JUST MY GUESS.\nSENATOR SESSIONS, GREAT TO SEE YOU THIS MORNING.\nTHANKS FOR DOING THIS. ANNA AND CLAYTON.\n>> GREAT INTERVIEW.",
