HERE IS CLINTON TRYING TO TELL\nPEOPLE OFF THE TOP, DON'T BELIEVE WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO\nSEE. >> I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT\nDONALD TRUMP HAS SHOWN US WHO HE IS.\nHE CAN HIRE AND FIRE ANYBODY HE WANTS FROM HIS CAMPAIGN.\nTHEY CAN MAKE HIM READ NEW WORDS FROM A TELEPROMPTER.\nBUT HE IS STILL THE SAME MAN WHO INSULTS GOLD STAR FAMILIES,\nDEMEANS WOMEN, MOCKS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, AND THINKS HE\nKNOWS MORE ABOUT ISIS THAN OUR GENERALS.\nTHERE IS NO NEW DONALD TRUMP. THIS IS IT.\n>> IS IT IN THE SENSE THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS PROVEN\nFRUSTRATING TO HILLARY CLINTON IS BECAUSE PEOPLE THINK THEY\nKNOW HER BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN AROUND FOR SO LONG.\nIT'S HARD FOR PEOPLE TO CHANGE OPINIONS ABOUT HER.\nDONALD TRUMP, PEOPLE KNOW HIM AS A CELEBRITY AND A REAL ESTATE\nGUY BUT HE DID CHANGE OPINIONS ABOUT HIM BECAUSE HE'S NEW ON\nTHE POLITICAL STAGE. IS THERE A FEAR IN THE CAMPAIGN?\nTHEY MAY THINK IT'S CYNICAL AND BOGUS, BUT DO THEY THINK IT\nMIGHT WORK? >> THEY WORRY IT MIGHT HAVE THE\nEFFECT OF CONSOLIDATING REPUBLICANS.\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT THE POLLING IN RECENT WEEKS, IT'S SHOWN THAT\nDONALD TRUMP HAS NOT DONE WHAT VIRTUALLY EVERY OTHER REPUBLICAN\nNOMINEE HAS DONE, WHICH IS CONSOLIDATE HIS BASE.\nGET UP WHERE SHE IS AMONG DEMOCRATS, IN THE 80s AND CLOSE\nTO THE 90s AMONG REPUBLICANS. THERE ARE MANY REPUBLICANS\nINCLUDING PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON WHO WANT TO SAY WE WANT TO KNOW\nIF DONALD TRUMP WILL BE RELIABLE TO DO WHAT WE WANT HIM TO DO.\nTHAT'S WHAT HE DEMONSTRATED LAST WEEK.\nI DON'T THINK THE CLINTON FOLKS ARE WORRIED ABOUT SWING VOTERS.\nTO JONATHAN'S POINT, THE SUBURBAN WOMEN, THEY'VE BEEN\nBOMBARDED WITH ADS FROM THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN LOCKING IN\nDONALD TRUMP'S PERSONA FOR MANY, MANY MONTHS NOW.\nIT WILL BE VERY HARD TO UNDO THAT WITH ONE SPEECH.\nI THINK REPUBLICANS WHO ARE LOOKING FOR A REASON TO TRUST\nTRUMP, THIS MIGHT BE THAT REASON THAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR.\n>> A LOT OF THE POLLS SHOW THAT SOME OF THE REPUBLICANS ARE\nCONCERNED ABOUT HIM BEING INTOLERANT.\nONE IN FIVE REPUBLICAN MEN SEE HIM AS INTOLERANT.\n25% OF REPUBLICAN WOMEN. SO WHEN HE GOES AND HE IS IN\nFRONT OF THE WHITE AUDIENCES, HE ACTUALLY IS APPEALING TO THOSE\nWHITE AUDIENCES WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT AFRICAN-AMERICANS.\nHE ISN'T REALLY, I DON'T THINK AT LEAST, APPEALING TO\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS. HE IS TRYING TO APPEAL TO THE\nAUDIENCES HE IS IN FRONT OF. >> YOU MENTIONED THE SOFTER\nTOUCH OF KELLYANNE CONWAY. SHE HAS NEVER RUN A CAMPAIGN.\nA LOT OF REPUBLICANS ARE NERVOUS ABOUT HER RUNNING A CAMPAIGN AT\nTHIS LEVEL. SHE HAS A HISTORY OF MESSAGING\nTO GET TO MORE MODERATE VOTERS. WE SAW DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE\nPENCE GO TO BATON ROUGE. IT'S A PHOTO OP.\nA LOT OF THEM DO. I AM NOT CRITICIZING HIM.\nHE WENT AND SHOWED SOME COMPASSION.\nHELPING UNLOAD AN AID TRUCK. ON A COUPLE OCCASIONS HE SAID HE\nTHOUGHT BARACK OBAMA SHOULD HAVE BROKEN HIS VACATION AND GONE\nTHERE OR AT LEAST COME BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE TO MONITOR THIS.\nIS THIS A SMART, REACTIVE POLITICS, NEITHER HERE NOR\nTHERE? >> I THINK IT'S A RARE MOMENT\nWHERE HE SAW A MOMENT THAT MADE HIM LOOK A BIT MORE\nCOMPASSIONATE AND WENT FOR THAT LANE.\nTHERE IS A LANE OPEN BECAUSE OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION UP\nUNTIL SEVERAL DAYS AGO NOT HAVING RELEASED A STATEMENT,\nTHOUGH THEY'VE DONE RESOURCE UPDATES.\nI THINK IT WAS NOT A BAD MOVE. THE QUESTION IS CAN HE FIND THE\nLANES FOR THE REST OF THE CAMPAIGN.\nYOU'RE RIGHT WHEN HE IS PROBABLY TRYING TO GO AFTER DISAFFECTED\nREPUBLICANS. HAD HE DONE IT SIX MONTHS AGO,\nIT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE LIKELY.\nAT THIS POINT IT'S TOUGHER. >> GREAT POINT.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WATCHED THE STATUS QUO SPEECH WERE LIKE, WHY\nDIDN'T YOU DO THIS BEFORE? T\nTHE CAMPAIGN SHAKEUP. I DON'T THINK VOTERS TEND TO\nVOTE FOR WHO IS ON THE LETTERHEAD.\nBUT THIS WAS INTERESTING. PAUL MANAFORT GETS SHOVED ASIDE\nAND THEN RESIGNS. KELLYANNE CONWAY GETS PROMOTED.\nSHE WAS THE SENIOR ADVISER AND IS NOW THE CAMPAIGN MANAGER.\nSTEVE BANNON FROM BRIGHT BART. AND ROGER AILES IS SHOWING UP AT\nCERTAIN MEETINGS. HE HELPED GEORGE H.W. BUSH MEET\nMICHAEL DUKAKIS. HE IS A GUY WHO JUST HAD TO QUIT\nHIS JOB BECAUSE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS.\nI CAN'T ASSUME THE HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN WON'T USE THAT\nIN AN ADD PRETTY SOON. INSIDE THE SHAKEUP IT'S MADE\nESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS NERVOUS.\nSTEVE BANNON HAS TREATED THEM AS A PINATA.\nIF YOU ARE A REPUBLICAN LEADER THE MAN HAS ESSENTIALLY CALLED\nYOU WORSE THAN THE DEMOCRATS. >> IT'S A JEKYLL AND HYDE\nSHAKEUP. THERE ARE TWO OPPOSITE SIDES\nHERE. THE CONCERN WITH BANNON IS THAT\nHE IS ONLY SKILLED -- AND A LITTLE BIT AILES -- THEY'RE ONLY\nSKILLED IN REACHING THE PEOPLE YOU'RE ALREADY REACHING.\nIS THAT THE GOAL? FOR A COUPLE DAYS IT LOOKED LIKE\nHE WAS TRYING TO REACH OTHER PEOPLE.\nI THINK HE'LL ALWAYS GO BACK TO THE BANNON AND AILES SIDE.\n>> MANAFORT CAME IN. HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE ADULT.\n>> HE DOESN'T WANT THAT. >> LOW ENERGY.\nHE JEB BUSHED HIM. >> TRUMP STARTED CALLING\nMANAFORT LOW ENERGY. TRUMP DOESN'T WANT ORDER.\nHE DOESN'T WANT DISCIPLINE. HE DOESN'T WANT A CHAIN OF\nCOMMAND. HE WANTS TO DO HIS THING, WHICH\nIS MAKING DECISIONS ON THE FLY BASED UPON COVERAGE, WATCHING\nSHOWS LIKE THIS, READING THE PAPERS.\nTHAT'S HOW HE OPERATES. WITH COUNSEL FROM HIS KIDS.\nLOOK, IS HE GOING TO HAVE FOLKS AROUND HIM?\nYES. BUT HE'LL NEVER OPERATE LIKE A\nTRADITIONAL CANDIDATE. MANAFORT'S EFFORTS TO IMPOSE A\nTRADITIONAL CAMPAIGN STRUCTURE ON TRUMP WERE FOUND TO FAIL.\nIN SOME WAYS IT'S AMAZING THAT IT LASTED THIS LONG.\nHE WAS TRYING TO MAKE TRUMP INTO A TRADITIONAL CANDIDATE.\nIT WAS NOT A MARRIAGE MADE IN",

BEST WEEK SO FAR.\nBUT THE OTHER THING I LEARNED IS I THINK DONALD TRUMP IS BACK IN\nHILLARY CLINTON'S HEAD. >> CONGRESSMAN KUCINICH, SHOULD\nHILLARY CLINTON BE CONCERNED ABOUT DEBATING DONALD TRUMP?\n>> IN A WORD, YES, AND HERE IS WHY.\nIF THIS WAS A BOXING MATCH, HILLARY CLINTON IS A CHAMP\nBECAUSE SHE CAN WIN ON POINTS. VERY FEW PEOPLE HAVE THE COMMAND\nOF THE ISSUES THAT SECRETARY CLINTON DOES.\nON THE OTHER HAND, DONALD TRUMP IS LIKE A BRAWLER.\nAND HE COULD KNOCK HIMSELF OUT OR HE COULD ALSO KNOCK OUT HIS\nOPPONENT. SO THIS IS GOING TO BE PROBABLY\nONE OF THE MOST WATCHED PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE SEASONS THAT\nWE'VE EVER HAD. >> AND CONTINUING WITH THAT\nANALOGY, CONGRESSWOMAN HAYWARD, SO IF DONALD TRUMP IS THE BOXER,\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS A CUT OVER HER EYE.\n>> YEAH. >> AND THAT'S HER E-MAIL USE OF\nHER PRIVATE SERVER FOR E-MAILS. >> YES.\n>> AND HER TRUSTWORTHY FACTOR OR LACK THEREOF.\n>> YES. >> SO HOW DOES DONALD TRUMP KEEP\nPUNCHING ON THAT CUT? >> ONE WAY IS BY MAKING THE\nTRANSITION THAT HE DID THIS WEEK TO EMPHASIZING THE MESSAGE AND\nTHE ISSUES AND TO GETTING HIS OWN PERSONA IN THE BACKGROUND SO\nTO SPEAK SO THAT THE REAL QUESTIONS ABOUT HILLARY\nCLINTON'S CHARACTER AND INTEGRITY, AND THE VERY\nLEGITIMATE QUESTIONS, THE EVIDENCE-BASED QUESTIONS ABOUT\nHOW SHE DEALT WITH HER -- WITH THE INFORMATION THAT SHOULD HAVE\nBEEN PROTECTED ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AND WHAT SHE WAS\nDOING FOR THE CLINTON FOUNDATION AND FOR HER OWN INTERESTS AS SHE\nWAS SECRETARY OF STATE. THOSE ARE LEGITIMATE QUESTIONS\nTHAT DO DESERVE ATTENTION. >> OKAY.\nAND CONGRESSMAN KUCINICH, I WANT TO END WITH YOU.\nHOW DOES DONALD TRUMP AVOID SELF-INFLICTED WOUNDS AND COSTLY\nPOLITICAL MISSTEPS GOING FORWARD?\n>> IT'S IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO FOCUS ON THE NEEDS OF THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE. TO BASICALLY STEP OUT OF HIS EGO\nAND TALK ABOUT JOBS, ABOUT THE TRADE, WHICH HAS HURT THE\nPEOPLE, ABOUT THE TPP WHICH IS A HORRIBLE TRADE DEAL.\nABOUT GLASS-STEAGALL AND WHAT IS HAPPENING ON WALL STREET THAT\nCOULD END UP HURTING THE ECONOMY.\nIF HE FOCUSES ON ECONOMICS, HE HAS A CHANCE.\nIF HE DOESN'T AND THERE IS MORE GAFFES, HILLARY CLINTON WILL WIN\nEASILY. >> WELL, YOU GET THE LAST WORD,\nCONGRESSMAN KUCINICH. CONGRESSWOMAN HAYWARD, GOOD TO\nHAVE YOU BOTH HERE. AND PER BOTH YOU HAVE, THIS RACE\nIS FAR FROM OVER. ERIC?\n>> ALL RIGHT, THANKS, ARTHEL.",

ANOTHER BIG SHAKEUP IN THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN THIS WEEK PROMOTING VETERAN GOP POLLSTER KELLYANNE\nCONWAY TO CAMPAIGN MANAGER.

THEY CAN MAKE HIM READ NEW WORDS\nFROM A TELEPROMPTER. BUT IS STILL THE SAME MAN WHO\nINSULTS GOLD STAR FAMILIES, DEMEANS WOMEN, MOCKS PEOPLE WITH\nDISABILITIES, AND THINKS HE KNOWS MORE ABOUT ISIS THAN OUR\nGENERALS. >> JOINING THE PANEL THIS WEEK,\n\"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" COLUMNIST AND DEPUTY EDITOR DAN HENNINGER\nAND JAMES FREEMAN. KIM, LET'S TAKE THESE PERSONNEL\nCHANGES FIRST. DO THESE CHOICES, CAN THEY MAKE\nA DIFFERENCE IN THE CAMPAIGN? >> THEY SEEM TO HAVE MADE SOME\nDIFFERENCE SO FAR. WHAT WE'VE SEEN THIS WEEK IS A\nDONALD TRUMP WHO HAS BEEN READING FROM SCRIPT IN A MORE\nDISCIPLINED MANNER. WE SAW DONALD TRUMP IN\nCHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA, WHO ACTUALLY EXPRESSED REGRET FOR\nSOME OF THE COMMENTS HE'D MADE AND TALKING ABOUT HOW THIS\nNEEDED TO BE A CAMPAIGN THAT PULLED PEOPLE TOGETHER.\nWE KNOW HE'S GOING TO BE GIVING A SERIES OF POLICY SPEECHES OVER\nTHE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS THAT TOUCH ON IMMIGRATION AND EDUCATION\nREFORM. SO THIS IS A DIFFERENT DONALD\nTRUMP. YOU SEE THE INFLUENCE OF\nKELLYANNE CONWAY. THE QUESTION IS, CAN HE STAY ON\nTRACK. >> I WANT TO DISTINGUISH HERE\nBETWEEN BANNON AND CONWAY. WHAT SKILLS, EXPERIENCE DOES SHE\nBRING TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN? >> LOOK, SHE IS MORE OF A\nVETERAN PERSON IN POLITICS. SHE'S WORKED ON A LOT OF\nCAMPAIGNS, INTERESTINGLY WITH KIND OF ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT\nCHARACTERS IN THE PAST. SO SHE'S COMFORTABLE IN THAT\nREALM. SHE'S VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT\nTHE WOMEN'S VOTE. SHE'S MADE A KIND OF STUDY AND\nART OF IT. HER GOAL IS TO MAYBE MAKE DONALD\nTRUMP NOT JUST MORE RIGOROUS AND DISCIPLINED, BUT HUMANIZE HIS\nCAMPAIGN A LITTLE BIT AND MAKE IT MORE OPTIMISTIC.\nSHE SAID AS MUCH. >> THAT'S NOT STEVE BANNON'S\nFORTE. >> HIS IS TO APPEAL TO UNIONIZED\nDEMOCRATS, THE FORGOTTEN PEOPLE AS TRUMP DESCRIBES THEM.\nTRUMP HAS FINALLY FIGURED OUT HE'S NOT GOING TO WIN MERELY\nWITH THE BASE THAT PROVIDED HIM IN THE VICTORY IN THE PRIMARIES.\nTHE OPINION POLLS SHOW YOU LOSE IF THAT'S ALL YOU GET IN THE\nGENERAL ELECTION. NOW, I READ THAT SPEECH WHERE HE\nTALKS ABOUT THE SYSTEM BEING RIGGED, THAT'S BERNIE SANDERS.\nWHEN HE ATTACKED WASHINGTON INSIDERS --\n>> BUT THOSE ARE OLD MESSAGES. >> I'M TALKING ABOUT THE BASE\nHE'S TRYING TO ASSEMBLE. CLEARLY TRUMP HAS FIGURED OUT.\n>> WHAT ABOUT THE -- >> THIS IS DESPERATION ON THE\nPART OF DONALD TRUMP, SHAKING UP HIS CAMPAIGN THIS CLOSE TO LABOR\nDAY. THINGS ARE -- HE'S IN TROUBLE\nAND HE KNOWS IT. I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING OF A\nHAIL MARY. BANNON TO ME SIGNALS THAT TRUMP\nWANTS TO BE TRUMP. BANNON RUNS BREITBART, A WEBSITE\nTHAT IF ANYTHING THINKS TRUMP HAS BEEN TOO MILD MANNERED UP\nUNTIL NOW. SO THIS IS SOMEONE I THINK WHO\nWANTS TRUMP TO CONTINUE RUNNING THE CAMPAIGN HE RAN IN THE\nPRIMARIES. AND THAT'S WHAT HE'S SURROUNDED\nHIMSELF WITH. I THINK KELLYANNE CONWAY WE ALL\nKNOW HER, WE'VE KNOWN HER A LONG TIME.\nBUT SHE'S NOT A CAMPAIGN MANAGER.\nSHE'S -- THIS IS GOING TO BE NEW FOR HER.\nSHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO ADJUST TO THIS.\n>> WE'LL SEE. >> I THINK THAT'S HER TITLE.\nI DON'T THINK SHE'S GOING TO MANAGE THE CAMPAIGN.\nI THINK SHE'S GOING TO TRY TO IMPROVE AND REFINE THE MESSAGE.\n>> RIGHT.

AND THEN THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH\nADVICE TRUMP SEEMS WILLING TO TAKE.\n>> THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.\nBUT HERE'S WHAT I -- WHAT'S SURPRISING TO ME.\nTRUMP SAID WHEN HE MADE THE  I'M THE SAME PERSON.\nTHEN HE GIVES THAT SPEECH, WHICH IS A DIFFERENT PERSON.\nAT LEAST IT'S DIFFERENT RHETORIC.\nIF HE HAD GIVEN THAT SPEECH AT THE CONVENTION THEN THAT HAD\nBEEN THE SPEECH FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS, I THINK THIS\nCAMPAIGN COULD BE IN A DIFFERENT PLACE.\n>> IT WAS A SPEECH TO ALL THE PEOPLE, TO THE FORGOTTEN PEOPLE\nWHO AREN'T WASHINGTON INSIDERS, BUT TO ALL AMERICANS.\nI THINK THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THERE FOR ALL AMERICANS TO\nAPPRECIATE. I THINK THIS HAS BEEN A GOOD FEW\nDAYS. I THINK TRUMP HAS BENEFITED FROM\nCREATING A STRUCTURE NOW. YOU DON'T WANT TOO MUCH\nMANAGEMENT IN CAMPAIGNS. BUT HE NEEDED A STAFF BEYOND HIS\nOWN INSTINCTS GOING OUT ON TWITTER.\nIF YOU THINK OF KELLYANNE CONWAY AS COMPETENTLY ALLOWING HIM TO\nSPEAK TO A BROADER AUDIENCE, MAYBE BANNON'S ROLE TO PRECISELY\nTARGET THE CASE AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON, THIS COULD BE A BIG\nWIN. >> HE'S ALSO ROLLING OUT ADS IN\nTHE CAMPAIGN.  >> IN HILLARY CLINTON'S AMERICA,\nTHE SYSTEM STAYS RIGGED AGAINST AMERICANS.\nILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS CONVICTED OF COMMITTING CRIMES GET TO STAY,\nSKIPPING THE LINE. OUR BORDER OPEN, IT'S MORE OF\nTHE SAME, BUT WORSE. DONALD TRUMP'S AMERICA IS\nSECURE. THE BORDER SECURE, OUR FAMILIES\nSAFE. CHANGE THAT MAKES AMERICA SAFE\nAGAIN. DONALD TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT.\n>> KIM, FIRST OF ALL, JUST RUNNING ADS IS A STEP FORWARD\nFOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. BUT WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT\nMESSAGE? THAT'S NOT THE MESSAGE OF\nCHARLOTTE. THAT'S THE TRUMP OF ANTI-TERROR\nAND THE PRIMAPRIMARIES. >> IT'S THE TRUMP TOO TRYING TO\nPLAY OFF GRIEVANCES OUT THERE, A GENERAL SENSE OF MALAISE AMONG\nVOTERS THAT THEY'RE NOT MOVING FORWARD.\nTHERE'S AN ELEMENT OF OPTIMISM TO THE AD TO IN THAT IT IS\nPRESENTING A FUTURE IN WHICH THEY'RE SAYING THE WORLD WILL BE\nBETTER UNDER TRUMP. IT'S NOT VERY SPECIFIC ON HOW\nTHAT WOULD HAPPEN. THIS IS MORE THE DONALD TRUMP OF\nTHE PRIMARY. >> ANYBODY ELSE HAVE A TAKE ON\nTHIS? JAMES?\n>> WELL, LOOK, THIS IS A WINNING ISSUE FOR HIM AS FAR AS LIMITING\nIMMIGRATION FROM PARTS OF THE WORLD WITH A HISTORY OF\nTERRORISM. HE SAID IN NORTH CAROLINA,\nDOVETAILS WITH THAT AD, WE'RE NOT GOING TO LED IN PEOPLE WHO\nTHINK SHARIA LAW SUPPLANTS THE U.S. CONSTITUTION.\nI DON'T KNOW ANYONE WHO COULD DISAGREE WITH THAT STATEMENT.\nYOU LOOK AT POLLS, THIS IS A WINNING MESSAGE.\n>> ALL RIGHT.",

BUT THERE'S AN EVEN MORE\nIMPORTANT ASPECT OF THIS. HILLARY CLINTON, LIKE HER\nHUSBAND, IS A MASTER AT PARSING WORDS TO THE POINT WHERE THEY\nHAVE MEANING, THEN USING THOSE MEANINGLESS WORDS THAT'S TO THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE. SHE WAS ON THIS SHOW AND ASKED\nBY CHRIS WALLACE ABOUT WHETHER SHE LIED TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC.\nSHE SAID THAT THE FBI DIRECTOR SAID THAT SHE'D BEEN TRUTHFUL IN\nHER RESPONSES. THE FBI DIRECTOR WAS TALKING\nABOUT HER RESPONSES TO THE FBI NOT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC.\nKIND OF A FUNCTIONAL EQUIVALENT THAT IT DEPENDS WHAT YOUR\nDEFINITION OF THE WORD \"IS\" IS. THEY'VE GIVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\nTHE OPPORTUNITY TO GET MORE ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS AND\nFORCE THIS CONVERSATION INTO THE PUBLIC.\nJUDICIAL WATCH HAS DONE A GREAT JOB ON THE ISSUE.\n>> WE'LL SEE ON THE TIMING OF THIS, BECAUSE SHE HAS 30 DAYS TO\nANSWER THE QUESTIONS ONCE THEY GET TO HER.\nWE EXPECT JUDICIAL WATCH WILL GET THEM OUT PROMPTLY BECAUSE\nTHEY WANT THESE BEFORE NOVEMBER 8th.\nBUT LISTEN, HER TEAM AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT IN MANY OF\nTHESE PRIVATE CASES THEY FILED FOR LENGTHY DELAYS.\nTHERE'S ONE THAT'S SPENDING INTO OCTOBER OF 2018.\nDO THEY TRY TO PUSH THIS PAST THE ELECTION, WILL THEY BE\nSUCCESSFUL? >> I THINK THEY WOULD BE SMART\nTO NOT PUSH IT PAST THE ELECTION BECAUSE IT WOULD LOOK TO BLATANT\nAT THIS POINT. THEY'VE MADE A BIG DEAL ABOUT\nWANTING TO ASK QUESTIONS AND THE PUBLIC WANTING THE ANSWERS.\nTHEY CAN DO THESE WRITTEN ANSWERS WHICH OBVIOUSLY GIVES\nTHEM MORE CONTROL THAN IF SHE WAS IN A DEPOSITION THAT WOULD\nBE PUSHED IN REALTIME. IF THEY DID PUSH FOR A DELAY, IT\nWOULD BE VERY FAIR TORE REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS TO\nCRITICIZE THEM FOR THAT. >> WE'LL SEE HOW QUICKLY THOSE\nQUESTIONS GET TO HER, BECAUSE THAT'S KEY.\nFROM FACEBOOK, A QUESTION FROM ANNETTE.\nI WOULD LIKE TO KNOW AS A STANDARD FOR JUSTICE IS THE\nVICTIM FOR AVERAGE AMERICANS AS IT IS FOR HILLARY?\n>> FAIR QUESTION. YOU KNOW, JUST LAST WEEK WE SAW\nWHERE A NAVY S.E.A.L. WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THE USAMA BIN LADEN\nRAID AND WROTE A BOOK ABOUT IT \"NO EASY DAY\" WAS FORCED TO HAND\nOVER ALL THE PROCEEDS, $6 MILLION FROM THE BOOK AND HAS TO\nPAY I THINK $100,000 IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS BASICALLY FOR\nVIOLATING THE NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS WHICH IS A SERIOUS\nISSUE. BUT MY GOODNESS, YOU HAVE THE\nSECRETARY OF STATE SHOWING SUCH CAVALIER DISREGARD FOR NATIONAL\nSECURITY, OUR SECRETS, AND NOTHING HAPPENS TO HER.\nAND THEN YOU HAVE A GUY WHO IS ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, IN THERE\nRISKING HIS LIFE DOING THE SAME SORT OF THING AND, MAN, THEY\nREALLY -- THEY DROP A TON OF BRICKS ON HIM.\nAND IT LOOKS INCREDIBLY UNFAIR. >> JUAN, ARE YOU READY FOR THE\nSTORY TO GO AWAY? >> I DON'T THINK IT GOES AWAY.\nIN FACT, IT'S THE WAY IT GOES AWAY, SHARON.\nIF IT GOES AWAY BECAUSE PEOPLE PERCEIVE THAT THERE IS, AS THE\nFACEBOOK WRITER SUGGESTED, AN UNEQUAL DISPENSIZATION OF\nJUSTICE IN AMERICA AND THAT THE RICH AND FAMOUS AND POLITICALLY\nCONNECTED HAVE ONE STANDARD AND THE REST OF US HAVE ANOTHER,\nTHEN IT DAMAGES EVERYBODY, NOT ONLY HILLARY CLINTON BUT PLAYS\nINTO THE IDEA YOU HEAR FROM SO MANY TRUMP SUPPORTERS, THAT THE\nSYSTEM IS RIGGED, THE ELECTION'S RIGGED.\nYOU GOT TO MOVE AWAY FROM THAT AT SOME POINT TO GET BACK TO THE\nLEGITIMACY OF THE AMERICAN POLITICAL STRUCTURE.\nI WANT TO ADD THAT THE FBI SAID QUITE EXPLICITLY WHEN IT\nRELEASED INFORMATION ON ITS BACKGROUND INTERVIEWS OF MRS.\nCLINTON AND OTHERS TO THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS THAT THEY DID\nNOT MAKE A MISTAKE. THEY REITERATED THAT THEY MADE\nTHE RIGHT DECISION IN DECIDING NOT TO PROSECUTOR.\nTHERE IS NO LEGITIMATE BASIS FOR PROSECUTING HILLARY CLINTON.\nAS TO WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S MISCHIEF TO BE MADE WITH WHAT\nSHE SAID ABOUT THIS OR COULD IT BE INTERPRETED DIFFERENTLY, I\nTHINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE A LOT OF THAT BECAUSE, GUESS WHAT,\nREPUBLICANS ARE UNDER PRESSURE GIVEN THE POLL NUMBERS THAT SHOW\nHER BEATING DONALD TRUMP CONVINCINGLY.\n>> AND WE HAVE TO MENTION, TOO, COMEY WAS -- I MEAN, HE DIDN'T\nTREAT HER WITH KID GLOVES. HE SAID SHE MADE A LOT OF\nMISTAKES, SHE WAS EXTREMELY CARELESS AND IT'S POSSIBLE THAT\nFOREIGN HOSTILE ACTORS WERE ABLE TO ACCESS HER COMMUNICATIONS BUT\nTHIS IS SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO BE THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND\nHANDLE THE MOST SENSITIVE COMMUNICATION.\n>> THAT'S A LEGITIMATE ARGUMENT. BUT WHEN COMEY WAS ASKED, NOT\nONLY WAS THIS EXHAUSTIVELY REVIEWED BY THE FBI, REMEMBER,\nIF YOU'RE TALKING TO CLINTON CAMPAIGN PEOPLE, THEY'LL TELL\nYOU HOURS OF TESTIMONY BY MRS. CLINTON IN PUBLIC BEFORE THE\nCONGRESS AND WE STILL HAVE NO EVIDENCE THAT SHE VIOLATED THE\nLAW. >> NOT UNDER OATH.\n>> BUT IT DOES GO TO -- >> YEAH, EXACTLY.\nBUT IT DOES GO TO THE ISSUE OF HER JUDGE MACHINE AND WHETHER\nSHE'S FIT TO BE THE TOP COMMANDER, YOU KNOW --\n>> I THINK SHE COMES ACROSS TO MY MIND OF ENTITLED PRIVILEGE\nTHINKING SHE CAN SET THE RULES. >> SHE DOESN'T COME ACROSS.\nSHE IS, IN FACT, ENTITLED TO PRIVILEGE.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS TICKET AND DONALD\nTRUMP. IT WAS TRICKLING IN AT THE\nBEGINNING OF THE WEEK WITH THE WORD OF STEVE BANNON AND\nKELLYANNE CONWAY ADDED TO NEW POSITIONS OR ADDED.\nWE WERE TOLD IT WAS AN ADDITION AND THERE WAS NO SHAKE-UP.\nMY TWITTER BLEW UP WHEN I USED THE WORD \"SHAKE-UP COUNTY \".\nBUT THEN WITHIN A WEEK PAUL MANAFORT WAS GONE.\n>> THERE WAS A PERIOD WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT\nDONALD TRUMP NEEDS TO STOP BEING PROVOCATIVE.\nHE NEEDS TO GIVE POLL TESTED ANSWERS WHICH ARE THE SAME\nANSWERS THAT POLITICIANS GIVE. THAT'S NOT DONALD TRUMP'S BRAND\nAND ISN'T WHAT GOT HIM THIS FAR. IT SHOULDN'T BE WHAT THE\nREPUBLICAN NOMINEE IS DOING. USING PROVOCATION TO GET\nATTENTION AND TALK ABOUT SERIOUS ISSUES.\nTHE REASON THAT ISIS IS THE GLOBAL THREAT THAT IT IS TODAY\nAND NOT THE JV TEAM THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA TALKED ABOUT IS\nBECAUSE A VOID THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FOREIGN POLICY OF\nWEAKNESS CREATED IN IRAQ THAT WAS THEN FILLED.\nIF DONALD TRUMP IS BEING PROVOCATIVE BY STARTING\nCONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHETHER LIBERAL DOMESTIC POLICIES HAVE\nHELPED PEOPLE IN DETROIT OR AFRICAN-AMERICANS AROUND THE\nCOUNTRY, THAT'S DONALD TRUMP GETTING EARNED MEDIA, BEING AT\nHIS BEST AND THEN THINKING IT TO A NATURAL PURPOSE.\nSOMETIMES WHEN THESE ARE MORE NILISTIC AND NOT TIED TO A\nPOLICY PROPOAL THAT COULD MAKE LIFE BETTER FOR ALL AMERICANS.\nTHIS IS TRUMP SAYING I'M GOING TO BE PROVOCATIVE AND BE MYSELF\nAND BE CONNECTED TO GOOD SOLUTIONS.\nKELLYANNE CONWAY VERY COMPETENT AND STEVE BANNON ARE COMPETENT.\nTHESE ARE TWO VERY GOOD PEOPLE AND COMPETENT WHO ARE GOING TO\nALLOW DT DOT BE DONALD TRUMP AND HOPEFULLILE TYING IT TO GOOD\nCONSERVATIVE POLICIES. >> WE'VE SEEN PRAISE FOR HIM\nFROM THESE TELEPROMPTER SPEECHES, MAKING SPEECHES TO THE\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, TALKING ABOUT LAW AND ORDER AND\nEXPRESSING REGRET. THIS WAS NO DOUBT DONALD TRUMP'S\nBEST WEEK IN QUITE A LONG TIME. THE PROBLEM FOR TRUMP IS THAT HE\nDOESN'T GET THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT ANY MORE WHEN WE SEE HIM\nHAVE A ONE-OFF GOOD SPEECH OR A STRONG WEEK BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN\nTHAT BEFORE. IF YOU REMEMBER WHEN PAUL\nMANAFORT WAS HIRED EARLIER THIS YEAR, DONALD TRUMP ACTUALLY WAS\nPERFORMING QUITE WELL IN THE AFTERMATH OF THAT HIRE, THEN WE\nSAW HIM FALL OFF AGAIN. IT'S CONSISTENCY THAT'S THE\nPROBLEM. CAN DONALD TRUMP GET UP THERE\nDAY AFTER DAY, WEEK AFTER WEEK AND, TO MICHAEL'S POINT, BOTH BE\nHIMSELF BUT ALSO FOCUS ON HIS CORE MESSAGE, FOCUS ON POLICY?\nBECAUSE HE ACTUALLY DOES HAVE A MESSAGE THAT SHOULD BE\nRESONATING WITH THIS ELECTORATE WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT BEING AN\nOUTSIDER, ABOUT BEING THE ONLY CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE THAT CAN\nACTUALLY BRING CHANGE TO WASHINGTON.\nTHAT WILL RESONATE WITH PEOPLE. THAT GETS LOST AMONG SOME MANY\nOTHER THINGS. >> THE PIVOT REMINDS ME OF LUCY\nWITH THE FOOTBALL AND CHARLIE BROWN.\nEVERY TIME CHARLIE TRUSTS THAT SHE'S REALLY GOING TO HOLD IT,\nBUT NO.

            "text": "SUNDAY.\n>>> HELLO AGAIN FROM FOX NEWS IN WASHINGTON.\nIT HAS BEEN A DRAMATIC WEEK FOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, ONE THAT\nINCLUDED A COMPLETE MANAGEMENT OVERHAUL.\nPAUL MANAFORT RESIGNED OVER CONTROVERSY OVER CONSULTING WORK\nIN UKRAINE. EARLIER IN THE WEEK TRUMP NAMED\nTHE CHAIRMAN OF THE BREITBART NEWS WEBSITE STEVE BANNON AS HIS\nCHIEF CAMPAIGN EXECUTIVE AND KELLYANNE CONWAY AS HIS CAMPAIGN\nMANAGER. THIS COMES AS TRUMP ATTEMPTS TO\nBROADEN HIS APPEAL, EXPRESSING REGRET OVER COMMENTS HE'S MADE.\nJOINING ME NOW IS FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR RUDY GIULIANI.\nWELCOME BACK TO FOX NEWS SUNDAY. >> GREAT PLEASURE TO BE HERE.\n>> THE WEEK YOU'VE HAD, IT'S BEEN MIXED.\nTHERE'S BEEN TALK OF THE CAMPAIGN SHAKE-UP.\nBUT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE POLLS BECAUSE THIS IS THE\nREALITY OF WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH RIGHT NOW IN SEVERAL KEY\nBATTLEGROUND STATES. FROM OHIO TO VIRGINIA YOU'VE GOT\nMRS. CLINTON LEADING FROM 2.8 UP TO 11.2 PERCENTAGE POINTS.\nHOW DO YOU TURN THAT AROUND AT THIS POINT?\n>> WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY EARLY IN THAT SENSE.\nI MEAN, AT THIS STAGE OF THE CAMPAIGN, GEORGE BUSH 41 WAS\nBEHIND MICHAEL DUKAKIS BY 16%. BY 16%.\nAT THIS POINT IN THE CAMPAIGN RONALD REAGAN WAS BEHIND JIMMY\nCARTER BY NUMBERS FAIRLY SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU JUST SHOWED RIGHT\nTHERE. IN FACT, SOME OF THOSE ARE\nWITHIN THE MARGIN OF ERROR. SO I'M NOT CONCERNED AT ALL.\nI THINK DONALD TRUMP THIS WEEK HAD AN EXCELLENT WEEK, MUCH,\nMUCH BETTER THAN HILLARY CLINTON.\nIN FACT, SHE KIND OF DISAPPEARED FOR THE WEEK EXCEPT FOR HER ONE\nAPPEARANCE THAT I REMEMBER WHERE SHE SAT WITH A COUPLE OF\nDEMOCRATIC APPOINTED POLICE CHIEFS TRYING TO CLAIM THAT SHE\nHAS POLICE SUPPORT. AND I DON'T KNOW A SINGLE COP IN\nTHE UNITED STATES THAT SUPPORTS HER.\nAND I KNOW A LOT OF COPS. AND --\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT -- >> WHAT HE DID THIS WEEK WAS HE\nOUTLINED IN GREAT DETAIL WHAT HE WANTS FOR THIS COUNTRY, ABOUT\nISLAMIC TERRORISM, ABOUT THE ECONOMY, ABOUT BRINGING JOBS\nBACK. HE THEN MADE AN AUDIBLE, MEANING\nHE CHANGED HIS SCHEDULE TO GO TO LOUISIANA TO BRING ATTENTION TO\nTHE PEOPLE OF LOUISIANA WHILE THE PRESIDENT, YOU KNOW, IS\nSTILL UP THERE IN WHEREVER HE IS PLAYING GOLF.\n>> THE PRESIDENT SAYS, OF COURSE, HE'S GOING DOWN ON\nTUESDAY. BUT THAT WAS PART OF A VERY BUSY\nWEEK FOR MR. TRUMP. LET'S TALK THROUGH SOME OF THE\nSPEECHES THAT HE'S GOTTEN A LOT OF PRAISE FOR.\nFIRST ONE YOU TALKED ABOUT HE'S OUTLINED HIS PLAN TO GO AFTER --\nTO STOP RADICAL ISLAM. HE TALKED ABOUT EXTREME VETTING.\nWE ALSO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF HIS GENERAL ELECTION AD NOW AIRING\nIN SEVERAL KEY BATTLEGROUND STATES.\n>> IN HILLARY CLINTON'S AMERICA, THE SYSTEM STAYS RIGGED AGAINST\nAMERICANS. SYRIAN REFUGEES FLOOD IN.\nILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS CONVICTED OF COMMITTING CRIMES GET TO STAY,\nCOLLECTING SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS, SKIPPING THE LINE.\nOUR BORDER OPEN, IT'S MORE OF THE SAME BUT WORSE.\n>> CRITICS SAY POINTING TO THE IMAGERY IN THAT AD AND SAYS THAT\nIT PAINTS IMMIGRANTS IN A DISCRIMINATORY FASHION OR USES\nSCARE TACTICS. THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE WORDS\n\"EXTREME VETTING\" MEANS. CAN YOU TELL US?\n>> EXTREME VETTING MEANS FROM COUNTRIES THAT HOUSE TERRORISTS,\nCOUNTRIES FROM WHICH ATTACKS ON THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN\nLAUNCHED, THERE IS GOING TO BE A VERY, VERY STRICT TEST IN ORDER\nTO GET INTO THE UNITED STATES. YOU DON'T HAVE A RIGHT TO COME\nTO THE UNITED STATES. THERE'S NO SUCH RIGHT TO COME TO\nTHE UNITED STATES. SO WE SHOULD BE TAKING IN PEOPLE\nWHO BELIEVE IN US, WHO BELIEVE IN WHAT WE BELIEVE IN, AND WHO\nARE DEDICATED TO THE PRINCIPAL OF A NATION OF LAWS, NOT SHARIAH\nLAW BUT AMERICAN LAW. AND FROM CERTAIN COUNTRIES WHERE\nWE'VE HAD PROBLEMS, IT'S GOING TO BE PRETTY HARD TO GET IN.\nAND IT SHOULD BE. FOR EXAMPLE, TAKING IN SYRIAN\nREFUGEES, WHICH HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO INCREASE BY 550%,\nTHAT'S 5 1/2 TIMES MORE THAN OBAMA HAS BROUGHT IN.\nSHE WANTS TO BE THE ANGELA MERKEL OF THE U.S.\nISIS HAS TOLD US THEY ARE GOING TO PUT TERRORIST OPERATIVES IN\nWITH THOSE SYRIAN REFUGEES. THEY'VE ACTUALLY TOLD US.\nNOW, WE WOULD HAVE TO BE STUPID TO ALLOW THEM TO COME INTO THE\nUNITED STATES. WE WOULD HAVE TO BE OUT OF OUR\nMINDS. WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS SET UP A\nNO-FLY ZONE IN SYRIA AND PUT THEM THERE.\nKEEP THEM IN THEIR COUNTRY SO THEY'RE NOT FLOODINGY.\nLOOK AT HOUSE CLIMATE HAS GONE UP IN GERMANY SINCE THEY'VE\nALLOWED SYRIAN REFUGEES IN. ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU HAD TERROR\nATTACKS IN THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT PLACES IN GERMANY.\nWE DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN IN THE UNITED STATES.\nWE HAVE ENOUGH HOME GROWN PROBLEMS THAN TO BRING IN A\nBUNCH OF SYRIAN REFUGEES. I'M SURE MANY OF WHOM ARE\nLEGITIMATE PEOPLE, BUT WE'VE BEEN TOLD THEY ARE GOING TO HIDE\nTERRORISTS WITH THEM. AND HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO\nINCREASE THAT BY FIVE TIMES. SO SHE WANTS TO MAKE THE RISK\nFIVE TIMES WORSE THAN IT ALREADY IS.\nWE ALREADY HAVE 1,000 INVESTIGATIONS ACCORDING TO THE\nDIRECTOR OF THE FBI OF TERRORISTS HERE IN THE UNITED\nSTATES. SHE WANTS TO ADD TO THE 1,000\nINVESTIGATIONS. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT ANOTHER\nSPEECH MR. TRUMP GAVE THIS WOKE. HE DID SOMETHING WE HAVE NOT\nSEEN BEFORE, AT LEAST PUBLICLY. HE TALKED ABOUT HAVING REGRETS.\n>> SOMETIMES IN THE HEAT OF DEBATE AND SPEAKING ON A\nMULTITUDE OF ISSUES, YOU DON'T CHOOSE THE RIGHT WORDS OR YOU\nSAY THE WRONG THING. I HAVE DONE THAT.\nBELIEVE IT OR NOT, I REGRET IT. >> HE IS STILL THE SAME MAN WHO\nINSULTS GOLD STAR FAMILIES, DEMEANS WOMEN, MOCKS PEOPLE WITH\nDISABILITIES AND THINKS HE KNOWS MORE ABOUT ISIS THAN OUR\nGENERALS. THERE IS NO NEW DONALD TRUMP.\nTHIS IS IT. >> DO YOU THINK HE CAN WIN OVER\nHIS CRITICS, CONVINCE THEM HE'S TRULY SORRY?\n>> FIRST OF ALL, I'D LIKE TO SEE HER APOLOGIZE FOR HER LYING TO\nGOLD STAR MOTHERS ENSHE GAVE THEM A FALSE NARRATIVE OF HOW\nTHEIR SONS WERE KILLED AT BENGHAZI AND SAID IT WAS ABOUT A\nMOHAMMED VIDEO WHEN SHE DARN WELL KNEW IT WAS A TERRORIST\nATTACK BECAUSE SHE TOLD HER DAUGHTER THAT IN AN E-MAIL, THE\nNIGHT BEFORE OR THE NIGHT BEFORE THAT.\nI'D LIKE TO SEE HER APOLOGIZE FOR ALL THE MONEY THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION IS TAKING, LET'S SAY, FROM SAUDI ARABIA, WHERE WOMEN\nARE NOT ALLOWED TO DRIVE. YOU TELL ME SHE'S A FEMINIST AND\nSHE TAKES MONEY FROM A COUNTRY WHERE WOMEN ARE NOT ALLOWED TO\nDRIVE? YOU TELL ME SHE'S A FEMINIST\nWHEN SHE SPENDS A LOT OF TIME COVERING UP THE MISDEEDS OF HER\nHUSBAND AND ENGAGE IN A LOT OF THE ATTACKS ON THE WOMEN WHO\nWERE TELLING THE TRUTH? SHE'S A FEMINIST EXCEPT WHEN IT\nCOMES TO HER HUSBAND WHERE SHE ATTACKS THE WOMEN WHO ARE\nTELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT HIM. SHE DESERVES TO GIVE THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE AN APOLOGY. SHE CERTAINLY SHOULD GIVE US AN\nAPOLOGY FOR HAVING BEEN FOUND COMPLETELY CARELESS IN HANDLING\nNATIONAL SECURITY AS AN ISSUE. JIM COMEY SAID THAT.\nSHE SHOULD APOLOGIZE FOR LYING ON THIS SHOW ABOUT WHAT JIM\nCOMEY SAID. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO --\n>> WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THAT, BUT WITH THE SPECIFIC FOCUS ON\nHIM, DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE WRITTEN HIM\nOFF BECAUSE OF SOME OF HIS COMMENTS, DO YOU THINK THEY'LL\nACCEPT THAT EXPRESSION OF REGRET, NOT AN APOLOGY, DO YOU\nTHINK IT'S ENOUGH? >> I THINK IT IS.\nI THINK YOU'LL SEE THAT THROUGHOUT THE REST O THE\nCAMPAIGN. DONALD TRUMP IS EXTREMELY\nFOCUSED NOW. IF YOU LOOK AT THIS ENTIRE WEEK,\nYOU CAN SEE IT WAS FOCUSED ON ISSUES, HARD ISSUES, TOUGH\nISSUES, ISSUES ON WHICH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AGREE WITH HIM\nAND WITH US, MAYBE 60, 65%. 65 TO 70% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\nBELIEVE THE COUNTRY IS GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.\nAND IF HE CAN CONVINCE THEM THAT HE IS THE PERSON TO LEAD US,\nTHEN CERTAINLY HE'S THE ONLY ONE TO GIVE US CHANGE.\nWHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO -- THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS NO\nCAMPAIGN. SHE HARDLY APPEARED THIS WEEK.\nI DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE WAS. >> WHY IS SHE DOING SO WELL IN\nTHE POLLS? >> WHY?\n>> IT'S WORKING FOR HER. >> WHAT'S WORKING FOR HER IS SHE\nHAS AN ENTIRE -- READ MICHAEL  POST.\nSHE DOESN'T NEED A CAMPAIGN, SHE HAS \"THE NEW YORK TIMES,\" THE\nDAILY NEWS, CBS, NBC. SHE HAS ENTIRE MEDIA EMPIRE THAT\nCONSTANTLY DEMONIZES DONALD TRUMP AND FAILS TO POINT OUT\nTHAT SHE HASN'T HAD A PRESS CONFERENCE IN 300 DAYS, 200\nDAYS, 100 DAYS, I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG.\nFAILS TO POINT OUT SEVERAL SIGNS OF ILLNESS BY HER.\nALL YOU GOT TO DO IS GO ONLINE --\n>> HER CAMPAIGN AND PEOPLE DEFENDING HER SAYING THERE IS\nNOTHING FACTUAL TO THE CLAIMS ABOUT HER HEALTH AND THAT'S\nSPECULATION AT BEST. >> SO GO ONLINE AND PUT DOWN\nHILLARY CLINTON'S ILLNESS, TAKE A LOOK AT VIDEOS FOR YOURSELF.\n>> I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GET TO SOMETHING THAT'S CRITICISM\nCOMING FROM WITHIN THE PARTY AND GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO ANSWER\nTHAT. THIS WEEK REPUBLICANS FORMER\nLAWMAKERS, TOP GOP LEADERS WROTE A LETTER TO REINCE PRIEBUS\nURGING HIM TO DIVERT HIS MONEY AWAY FROM THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND\nANY MONEY AVAILABLE TO THE DOWN-BALLOT RACES.\nSAYING, QUOTE, WE BELIEVE THAT DONALD TRUMP'S DIVISIVENESS,\nRECKLESSNESS, INCOMPETENCE AND RECORD BREAKING UNPOPULARITY\nRISK TURNING THIS ELECTION INTO A DEMOCRATIC LANDSLIDE AND ONLY\nTHE IMMEDIATE SHIFT OF ALL AVAILABLE RNC RESOURCES TO\nVULNERABLE SNET AND HOUSE RACES WILL PREVENT THE GOP FROM\nDROWNING WITH A TRUMP-EMBLAZONED ANCHOR AROUND HIS NECK.\nYOUR RESPONSE. >> YOU KNOW, THE MOST AMAZING\nTHING TO ME IS THAT REPUBLICANS WOULD DO THAT TO OTHER\nREPUBLICANS. I HAD THE GREAT HONOR AND\nPRIVILEGE OF WORKING FOR RONALD REAGAN.\nIN FACT, HE'S THE ONLY PRESIDENT I'VE WORKED FOR.\nHE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT THE ELEVENTH COMMANDMENT WAS DON'T\nATTACK ANOTHER REPUBLICAN. I'M EMBARRASSED FOR THE PEOPLE\nTHAT WROTE THAT. I'M ALSO EMBARRASSED FOR HOW\nFRIGHTnd THEY GOT SO QUICKLY WHICH IS NOT A SIGN OF\nLEADERSHIP. I WROTE A BOOK ABOUT LEADERSHIP.\nONE CHAPTER IS ABOUT COURAGE. THE REALITY IS HE'S NOT THAT FAR\nBEHIND. HE'S WELL WITHIN STRIKING RANGE\nWITHIN EVERY ONE OF THE KEY STATES AND A COUPLE OF OTHER\nSTATES THAT REPUBLICANS DON'T HAVE A CHANCE OF WINNING.\nSO THIS IS UNNECESSARY FEAR ON THEIR PART.\nAND I'M SORT OF REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN THEM.\nBUT LOOK, DONALD TRUMP IS NOT A TYPICAL REPUBLICAN DEMOCRAT\nLIBERAL CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE. THIS IS AN INSIDER VERSUS\nOUTSIDER CAMPAIGN. SHE IS THE CONSUMMATE CORRUPT\nWASHINGTON INSIDER, AND SHE IS THOROUGHLY CORRUPT.\nAND SO IS THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nIF I WERE BACK IN MY OLD JOB AS U.S. ATTORNEY, I WOULD PROBABLY\nINDICT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION AS A RACKETEERING ENTERPRISE.\nTHEY TOOK MONEY FROM MONEY LAUNDERERS, CRIMINALS,\nDICTATORS, PEOPLE WHO ABUSE WOMEN AS A MATTER OF GOVERNMENT\nPOLICY. SHE DID FAVORS FOR THOSE VERY\nPEOPLE WHO GAVE MONEY TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nFOR EXAMPLE, UBS GAVE THE CLINTONS ALTOGETHER OVER A\nMILLION DOLLARS. SHE MADE A CALL TO THE IRS\nASKING THE IRS TO GO EASY ON THEIR ATTEMPTS TO GET IDENTITIES\nFROM UBS. IN MY DAY, THAT WAS CONSIDERED\nBRIBERY WHEN I WAS A U.S. ATTORNEY AND I PROSECUTED\nSEVERAL VERY PROMINENT POLITICIANS AND CONVICTED THEM\nOF BRIBERY -- >> MR. MAYOR --\n>> INCLUDING TWO CONGRESSMEN. >> WE HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE.\nAGAIN, THE CLINTON FOUNDATION AND ALL ASSOCIATED SAY THEY'RE\nNOT UNDER INVESTIGATION AND THEY'VE BEEN CLEAR AND\nTRANSPARENT. SO WE'LL STAY TUNED BECAUSE\nTHERE ARE THOSE THAT ARE -- >> THAT'S THE BIGGEST BUNCH OF\nGARBAGE I'VE EVER HEARD. >> MR. MAYOR, APPRECIATE YOUR\nTIME TOGETHER. >> THEY ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION.\nTHERE WAS A LEAK TO THAT JUST THE OTHER DAY.\nNUMBER TWO, IF THEY'RE NOT, THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE\nASHAMED OF ITSELF. >> WE'VE GOT TO LEAVE IT THERE.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING FOX NEWS SUNDAY, SIR.\n>> THANK YOU. >> UP NEXT, HILLARY CLINTON IS\nRISING IN THE POLLS BUT COULD NEW QUESTIONS ABOUT HER E-MAIL\nTESTIMONY HURT HER CAMPAIGN? A TOP CLINTON SUPPORTER BEN\nCARDIN JOINS US. PLUS, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT\nTRUMP'S CAMPAIGN SHUFFLE? IS IT GOING TO GIVE HIM THE\nKICKSTART HE NEEDS?

KEVIN, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.\nI WANT TO PLAY SOMETHING FOR YOU.\nRUDY GIULIANI WHO HAS BEEN ON THE STUMP QUITE A BIT WAS ON FOX\nNEWS SUNDAY AND HE WAS SAYING THAT THE CHANGE OF TONE IS\nREALLY A REFOCUS. HE WANT YOU TO LISTEN AND GET\nYOUR REACTION. >> DONALD TRUMP IS EXTREMELY\nFOCUSED NOW. IF YOU LOOK AT HIS ENTIRE WEEK,\nYOU CAN SEE IT WAS FOCUSED ON ISSUES.\nHARD ISSUES. TOUGH ISSUES.\nISSUES ON WHICH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AGREE WITH HIM AND WITH\nUS. MAYBE 60, 65%.\n65 TO 70% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BELIEVE THE COUNTRY IS GOING IN\nTHE WRONG DIRECTION.

LET'S START WITH THAT.\nBRINGING IN KELLYANNE CONWAY SEEMS TO HAVE A GOOD EFFECT ON\nTHE CAMPAIGN SO FAR. DOES HE HAVE THE TEMPERAMENT TO\nBE COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND WHETHER THEY'VE MADE UP THEIR\nMIND REMAINS TO BE DETERMINED IN THE POLLING THAT WILL COME OUT\nIN THE NEXT WEEK OR TWO. IF HE CAN STICK TO THIS.\nTHAT'S THE BIGGEST QUESTION WE ALWAYS HAVE WITH DONALD TRUM\nCAN HE STICK TO A MESSAGE AND NOT CREATE THE UNNECESSARY DRAMA\nHE HAS BEEN SUSCEPTIBLE TO. >> WE'VE HAD SO MANY COME ON THE\nSHOW AND SAY ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS.\nYOU SPOKE WITH ABOUT KELLYANNE CONWAY AND SHE PAIRED THIS\nMORNING ON CNN, AND SHE SAID LISTEN, IT IS TBD WHETHER DONALD\nTRUMP WILL MAKE THE CALL WHETHER HE WANTS TO DEPORT UP 11 MILLION\nUNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS OUT OF THE UNITED STATES IF HE BECOMES\nPRESIDENT. WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO THAT?\nDO YOU FEEL IF IT IS NOT JUST WORDS NOW, IF HE IS CHANGING THE\nACTIONS AND WILL PEOPLING RECEPTIVE TO THAT.\n>> I DON'T THINK IT WILL HURT HIM WITH HIS SUPPORTERS AND\nCOULD POSSIBLY SIGNAL A CHANGE FOR THE CAMPAIGN.\nI THINK, LOOK, THEY'RE GOING TO JUST SAY HIS SUPPORTER ALSO SAY\nIT IS A NEGOTIATING POSITION HE WAS STARTING FROM.\nEVERYTHING THAT HE HAS PROMISED THAT SUNDAYS GRANDIOSE AND\nCRAZY, ALE JUST SAY IT WAS A NEGOTIATING POSITION AND STILL\nGET THE WALL AND SOME OTHER IMMIGRATION CHANGES.\nSO HE IS NOT -- HE IS IN A BETTER POSITION DOING THIS, I\nTHINK, THAN NOTHING DOING IT. IT IS STILL AN OPEN QUESTION\nWHETHER IT WILL WORK. >> I WANT TO GET YOUR REACTION\nABOUT SOMETHING. WE TALKED ABOUT HIM REACHING OUT\nTO MINORITY GROUPS, THE STANCE WE HEARD FROM KELLYANNE CONWAY\nIN REGARDS TO THE PROBABLY NOT DEPORTATION OF 11 MILLION\nUNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. WHAT ABOUT HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH\nTHE RNC AND SOME OF THE GOP LEADERS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN REALLY\nRECEPTIVE TO HIM RUNNING. DO YOU THINK THEY'LL BE SHIFTING\nNOW WITH SOME OF THE TONE SHIFT THAT WE'VE SEEN?\n>> WELL, THE RNC HAS BEEN FULLY BEHIND HIM, MOST OF THE HOUSE\nAND SENATE SAID THEY'LL BACK HIM.\nTHERE HAS BEEN A FEW EXCEPTIONS. THERE ISN'T A MASS GROUP OF\nELECTED OFFICIALS IN THE RNC THAT HAVE DEFECTED FROM\nBUT IN THE PERCENTAGES OF REPUBLICANS, HE STILL HAS A\nPROBLEM, DOING WORST WITH REPUBLICANS THAN HILLARY CLINTON\nIS DOING WITH DEMOCRATS, AND HE NEEDS TO GET THEM BACK.\nWE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY'LL COME HOME.\n>> HOW DOES HE PLEASE BOTH SIDES?\nHE HAS A LOT OF WORK TO DO ON BOTH SIDES, EVEN IN THE GROUP\nTHAT WE DIDN'T THINK HE WOULD REALLY HAVE TO PLEASE AT THIS\nPOINT? >> WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE\nKELLYANNE CONWAY KIND OF HAS THAT SOLVED FOR THE MOMENT.\nIT ALMOST, YOU KNOW, YOU COULD HEAR KIND OF A CORE MESSAGE THAT\nHE HAS HAD. BUT IT WAS SOFTER IN SOME WAYS.\nYOU KNOW, IF HE CAN STICK TO IT, YOU KNOW, WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO\nSEE SOME SORT OF MOVEMENT OF REPUBLICANS BACK TO DONALD TRUMP\nAND YOU KNOW, SOME INDEPENDENTS WHO WANT TO GIVE HIM ANOTHER\nLOOK. HILLARY CLINTON HAD A TERRIBLE\nWEEK AGAIN THIS WEEK, AND SHE -- THE ADMINISTRATION CHANGED THE\nDEFINITION OF, YOU KNOW, THE WORD RANSOM, AND THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION IS STILL GOING TO TAKE FOREIGN DONATIONS AND\nCORPORATE MONEY UP UNTIL INAUGURATION DAY.\nPEOPLE DEFINITELY HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON.\n>> YEAH, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING HE HAS MATERIAL TO WORK\nWITH.

I THINK HE'S MUCH MORE\nDISCIPLINED. I THINK THIS NEW TEAM, STEVE\nBANNON AND KELLYANNE IS A QUALITY PROFESSIONAL.\nAND I THINK THIS IS A TEAM. THEY GOT TO TAKE IT ACROSS THE\nFINISH LINE. AND CERTAINLY MANAFORT WAS NOT\nGOING TO DO THAT. >> YEAH, I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY,\nJULIE, HE'S HAD A POSITIVE REACTION TO THIS NEW TEAM IN\nPLACE SO FAR. IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S ALSO GETTING\nA BUMP IN THE POLLS. >> WELL, HE HAS, BUT LET'S SEE\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT WEEK.

THEY'RE NOT GIVING HIM GOOD\nADVICE. THEY SHOULD HAVE PUT THIS ON TV,\nON THE AIR, ON THE GROUND. NOT WHAT THEY DID WITH IT WHICH\nIS ESSENTIALLY POCKET THE MONEY. MALPRACTICE OF THE HIGHEST\nDEGREE. >> AT THE SAME TIME HILLARY\nCLINTON HAS SPENT ALL OF HER MONEY ON JUST THAT.\n>> EXACTLY RIGHT. >> MARY, WHAT DO YOU THINK?\n>> I'M NOT SURE YOU CAN BLAME THE CONSULTANTS FULLY HOWEVER.\nDONALD TRUMP IS DONALD TRUMP. AND HE'S MADE THIS CAMPAIGN\nABOUT HIMSELF. WHY WAS THERE SO MUCH ATTENTION\nTO THIS ONE WORD REGRET IN HIS SPEECH ON FRIDAY, IT'S BECAUSE\nWE'RE FOCUSING ON DONALD TRUMP'S FEELINGS.\nWE'RE NOT FOCUSING ON HIS POLICY IDEAS OR WHY THEY'RE BETTER THAN\nHILLARY CLINTON'S. I THINK, LOOK, HE KNEW THAT THE\nCAMPAIGN WAS SPIRALING DOWNWARDS.\nHE'S NOT LEADING IN ANY OF THE POLLS.\nTHERE'S THE PROSPECT OF LOSING THE SENATE.\nIT'S A GOOD SIGN THAT HE BROUGHT IN A PRO LIKE KELLYANNE CONWAY\nAS A POLLSTER. BUT HE HAS TO PROVE THAT HE NOT\nONLY HAS THE TEMPERAMENT TO BE IN OFFICE, BUT THAT HE CAN\nSUSTAIN SOME OF THESE MESSAGES THAT HE STARTED TO LAY OUT IN\nTHESE SPEECHES LAST WEEK. WE'LL SEE, BUT THE POLLS DON'T\nCHANGE OVERNIGHT. >> CAN HE DO THAT?\n>> I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAS THE CHARACTER TO DO IT.\nHE HASN'T PROVED SO FAR. HE ISN'T STUDYING ANY POLICY\nMEASURES. WE DON'T HAVE SPECIFICS ON WHAT\nWOULD REPLACE OBAMACARE, HOW HE WOULD DEFEAT ISIS, THE TAX PLAN,\nFOR INSTANCE. IF YOU READ THE SPEECHES, THERE\nARE A LOT OF GOOD THEMES IN THERE.\nI'M GLAD THAT HE SUPPORTS CHARTER SCHOOLS.\nI'M GLAD HE WANTS TO GET RID OF REGULATORY TAPE.\nI'M GLAD HE WANTS TO UNLEASH AMERICAN ENERGY.\nTHAT'S VERY POSITIVE. >> YEAH.\n>> THIS WAS A VERY WINNABLE CAMPAIGN.\nI THINK IF YOU HAD THAT CAMPAIGN STRUCTURE IN PLACE THAT JULIA\nWAS TALKING ABOUT. >> YEAH.\n>> AND YOU HAD A MORE DISCIPLINED CANDIDATE, HE'D BE\nAHEAD BY 10 OR 20 POINTS AT THIS TIME IN THE RACE.\n>> NEWT GINGRICH LAID OUT A FEW MINUTES AGO ON YOUR SHOW THE\nOFFENSE THEY NEED TO BE ON.

GINGRICH MAY HAVE LAID IT OUT,\nHE CAN'T FOCUS ON HER, HE HAS TO CONSTITUTIONALLY ONLY FOCUS ON\nHIMSELF. THAT'S NOT WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO\nHEAR. >> IT'S PATHOLOGICAL, PEOPLE\nWANT TO HEAR HOW HE'S GOING TO IMPROVE THEIR LIVES.\nNOT WHAT HE FEELS ABOUT HIMSELF. >> I DON'T THINK YOU CAN JUST DO\nIT ON TWITTER AND FACEBOOK AND AT RALLIES.\nIT WAS GOOD THAT HE WENT TO LOUISIANA, BUT LET'S SEE HIM GO\nTO A CHARTER SCHOOL IN THE BRONX.\nLET'S SEE HIM GO INTO DOWNTOWN L.A., HAVE MORE PRESS GAGGLES,\nGET OUT THERE, MEET VOTERS.

WHY ARE THEY GIVING HER MONEY?\n>> YOU HAVE BILLIONAIRE WALL STREET GUYS REALLY SUPPORTING\nHILLARY CLINTON. PEOPLE LIKE GEORGE SOROS, TOM\nSTIRE, THE ENVIRONMENTALIST IN CALIFORNIA, HAS GIVEN HER A LOT\nOF MONEY. TRUMP DID BOAST $80 MILLION FOR\nTHE MONTH OF JULY BUT THAT MONEY IS NOT BEING SPENT AND ALLOCATED\nTHE SAME WAY THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS SPENDING IT.\nMONEY COMES IN THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN, SHE SPENDS IT,\nPARTICULARLY ON THESE ADS. YOU'VE SEEN A LOT OF NEGATIVE\nADS AGAINST DONALD TRUMP BUT SOME OF THE MONEY COMING IN FOR\nTRUMP IS ALSO COMING IN THROUGH THE RNC.\nSO SOME OF THAT MONEY HAS TO BE SPENT ON THE RNC AND ITS\nEXPENSES. EVEN IF IT'S A BIG BLOCKBUSTER\nJULY, ALL OF THAT MONEY IS NOT BEING SPENT ON WHAT HE NEEDS,\nGROUNDWORK, ORGANIZATION, AND THE NEGATIVE ADS.\n>> TEN WEEKS LEFT AND WE'VE SEEN SEEING BILLBOARDS POPPING UP IN\nSTATES LIKE CALIFORNIA PAID FOR BY THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND IN\nVIRGINIA WHERE HE'S DOWN BY 11 POINTS.\nIS THAT A GOOD MARSHALING OF THE MONEY BY THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN?\n>> THIS IS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE PARTY NOT BEING ALL IN\nON TRUMP RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THAT IS GETTING IN THE WAY HERE\nBECAUSE SOME OF THE MONEY IS GOING TOWARD, LIKE I SAID, RNC\nEXPENSES. AND SO -- AND THEY'RE TRYING TO\nGO DOWN BALLOT TO TRY TO SUPPORT THE OTHER CANDIDATES IN THE\nELECTION. SO AS A RESULT OF THAT, THIS\nFRACTURED SITUATION THAT YOU HAVE -- NOT HAVING EVERYBODY\nBEHIND TRUMP, THE MONEY IS NOT BEING SPENT AS WISELY AS THE\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN, AND IT IS HURTING HIM.\n>> THIS WEEK TOO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, THEY SPENT ALMOST $5\nMILLION ON ADS AND FOR KEY BATTLEGROUND STATES.\nHOW LONG BEFORE THEY SEE AN ROI IN ORDER TO SEE IF THEY NEED TO\nDO MORE THAN THAT? >> I THINK IT WILL HAPPEN\nQUICKLY. YOU ALSO HAVE A NUMBER OF SUPER\nPACS THAT ARE CHURNING OUT ADS FOR TRUMP, AND SO I THINK IT\nWILL -- YOU KNOW, I'M NOT AS WORRIED AS SOME PEOPLE ARE\nSAYING, LOOK, SHE'S GOT A HUGE ADVANTAGE ON THE MONEY SIDE.\nSHE DOES HAVE AN ADVANTAGE IN TERMS OF STRUCTURE.\nLOOK AT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WORK ON THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN VERSUS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR TRUMP.\nI MEAN, IT'S MINUSCULE RELATIVE. >> RIGHT.\n>> SHE'S GOT A LOT MORE RESOURCES.\nNO DOUBT ABOUT IT. >> YOU ALWAYS SAY -- I THINK YOU\nMUST BE THE HEAD BOOKER ON YOUR OWN SHOW.\n>> THIS MORNING I'M SITTING DOWN WITH ERIC TRUMP SO WE'LL TALK\nABOUT THIS LITTLE PIVOT WE'VE SEEN.\nPAUL MANAFORT OUT AS WELL AS TRUMP GOING TO LOUISIANA.\nA LOT OF HEADLINES AROUND TRUMP. WE'LL TALK TO ERIC TRUMP BECAUSE\nA LOT OF THE INFORMATION IN TERMS OF, YOU KNOW, HOW IT ALL\nWENT DOWN, THAT PAUL MANAFORT STEPPED DOWN, DID COME FROM I\nTHINK PARTLY IT'S INSIDERS, AND THAT IS THE FAMILY.\nWE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT. WE'VE GOT A GREAT SEGMENT COMING\nUP ON VOTER FRAUD, AND I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING EVERYBODY IS\nFOCUSED ON.

THIS, DRAGGING IT ON FOR OVER A\nWEEK AND STILL NOT ABLE TO ANSWER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS I\nTHINK IS JUST A PUBLIC RELATIONS NIGHTMARE FOR RYAN LOCHTE.\n>> CARLOS, FROM A PUBLIC RELATIONS PROFESSIONAL AS YOU\nARE, I SAID THAT INTERVIEW WAS UNCOMFORTABLE.\nWHAT I MEANT BY THAT IS THAT YOU KNOW WHAT HE HAS TO SAY.\nJUST SAY IT. >> RIGHT.\nAND BE DONE WITH IT. BUT HE DOESN'T.\nHOW DO YOU THINK THIS HAS BEEN HANDLED?\n>> I THINK IT'S BEEN HANDLED VERY POORLY FIRST AND FOREMOST\nBY LOCHTE AND WHOEVER HIS PR REPRESENTATIVES ARE.\nI WAS VERY SURPRISED TO FIND OUT THAT HE HAD TO HIRE SOMEONE\nCONSIDERING THAT HE'S AN OLYMPIC STAR FOR SEVERAL OLYMPICS.\nYOU WOULD THINK THAT HE ALREADY HAS A PR, REPUTABLE PR\nREPRESENTING HIM. >> WHAT SHOULD HE HAVE DONE?\nWHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE VERY FIRST STEP?\n>> I'LL PIGGYBACK ON WHAT CHRISTINE BRENNAN SAID, AND I\nAGREE 100%, THE NEXT DAY HE SHOULD HAVE -- WELL, FIRST AND\nFOREMOST HE SHOULD HAVE NEVER CAME UP WITH THE LIE.\nBECAUSE IF HE DOESN'T SAY THAT, THERE'S NO HARM, NO FOUL, NO ONE\nKNOWS ABOUT IT. BUT TO DEAL WITH IT FROM A --\nCOMING BACK FROM THAT, HE REALLY SHOULD HAVE OWNED UP TO IT FIRST\nAND FOREMOST. SECOND OF ALL, NOT BLAME ALCOHOL\nOR ANYTHING OR DEFLECT BLAME ON ANY OF THE SITUATION.\nAND THEN SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE FOR THOSE THREE GUYS THAT WERE\nLEFT BEHIND. I THINK THOSE THREE THINGS, FOR\nME, AS A PR EXPERT, THOSE STICK OUT THE BIGGEST.\n>> HOW BAD IS THE DAMAGE HERE FOR HIM?\n>> I'LL TELL YOU, IT'S PRETTY BAD AND PRETTY MUCH HE COST\nHIMSELF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WE'VE HAD SITUATIONS,\nUNFORTUNATELY, OVER THE PAST WHERE WE'VE HAD TO SUCCESSFULLY\nNAVIGATE CLIENTS THROUGH MEDIA CRISIS MOMENTS AND WE WERE ABLE\nTO LUCKILY EACH TIME NOT ONLY CLEAR THEIR NAME BUT ALSO EVEN\nGET NEW ENDORSEMENTS, BUT IT'S BECAUSE OF HOW WE SUCCESSFULLY\nPUT TOGETHER A TEAM, PUT TOGETHER STRATEGY.\n>> WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE THIS TIME?\nWHY DO YOU NOT SEEM SO OPTIMISTIC?\n>> FOR ONE, LIKE CHRISTINE SAID, THIS HAS LINGERED ON FOR OVER A\nWEEK. AND IT'S REALLY A TRAGEDY\nBEC BECAUSE, YEAH, SO MANY GREAT\nATHLETES FROM ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY, ALL AROUND THE WORLD\nWHO WON OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALS FOR THEIR COUNTRIES AS WELL AS OUR\nCOUNTRY AND THE BIGGEST STORIES HAS ALL THIS WEEK BEEN RYAN\nLOCHTE. I REALLY FEEL THAT WE EVEN HAD\nCLIENTS THAT WON MEDALS AND, UNFORTUNATELY, THEIR STORIES\nKIND OF MINIMALIZED BECAUSE THE MEDIA WANTED TO FOLLOW THIS.\n>> THAT ADDS TO THE ANGER. >> YEAH, IT DOES.\n>> I WANT TO BRING UP SOMETHING ELSE CHRISTINE BEFORE WE LOSE\nYOU AND I KNOW TIME IS SHORT. THESE ATHLETES THAT ARE BEING\nFORCED TO PAY $3,000 EACH IN FINES BEFORE AUTHORITIES ALLOW\nTHEM TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY, WHAT ARE THEY ACCUSED OF DOING?\nWHAT'S THE LATEST ON THIS? >> YOU KNOW, MARTIN, I HAVE\nACTUALLY NOT FOLLOWED THAT STORY AS CLOSELY.\nI BELIEVE THERE WAS SOMETHING WITH THEIR I.D.s, I BELIEVE,\nTHAT THEY MADE FAKE I.D.s. AND YOU KNOW, I THINK THE BIGGER\nISSUE HERE IS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOUNG ATHLETES AND THINGS\nARE GOING TO HAPPEN. AND YOU WANT TO MINIMIZE IT.\nI THINK YOU'RE SAYING THAT IT'S THE AUSTRALIAN OLYMPIC\nCOMMITTEE, YOU'RE BRINGING HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE INTO A\nCOMMUNITY OR INTO THIS CRUCIBLE OF INTERNATIONAL INTRIGUE AND\nEVERYONE'S WATCHING AT THE WORLD'S STAGE.\nSO YOU WILL HAVE A FEW THINGS HAPPEN.\nIT'S HOW YOU HANDLE IT. THE AUSTRALIAN THING IS\nINTERESTING. OF COURSE, THERE'S ALWAYS GOING\nTO BE SOMETHING. BUT I THINK THE LOCHTE THING\nSTANDS OUT ONLY BECAUSE OF JUST HOW LONG IT WENT ON AND WHAT AN\nEMBARRASSMENT IT WAS FOR THE U.S. ESPECIALLY U.S. BEING THE\nBIG CHEESE AT THE OLYMPIC GAMES WHERE EVERYONE FOCUSES ON WHAT\nTHE U.S. DOES AND U.S. OLYMPICS LIKES TO HAVE THINGS BE VERY LOW\nKEY. ONE OF ONLY TWO OLYMPICS THAT\nDOES NOT ALLOW FLAGS OR BANNERS ON THE DORMS AT THE OLYMPIC\nVILLAGE. AND U.S. AND ISRAEL, OF COURSE,\nFOR SECURITY REASONS, BUT ALSO TO HAVE A LOWER PROFILE.\nTHEN THIS HAPPENS. SO THE AUSTRALIANS ARE DEALING\nWITH SOMETHING, THE U.S. DEALING WITH SOMETHING.\nIT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. BUT THE LAST THING THE U.S.\nWANTS, MARTIN, IS TO HAVE SOMETHING EXPLODE LIKE THIS ONE\nEXPLODED OVER THE LAST WEEK OF THE GAMES.\n>> YEAH, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.\nCHRISTINE BRENNAN, I HAVE ALL RESPECT FOR YOUR WORK, THANK YOU\nVERY MUCH. CARLOS SCOTT, THANKS FOR JOINING\nME TODAY. I HOPE I WOULD NEVER NEED YOU,\nBUT IT'S GOOD TO KNOW YOU'RE THERE.\nTHANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT UP THE WORK IS JUST\nBEGINNING IN LOUISIANA. YOU'VE SEEN THE IMAGES NOW.\nUNFORTUNATELY THERE'S MORE RAIN THAT'S COMING DOWN AND REPORTS\nOF A FLOOD WARNING AGAIN FOR BATON ROUGE, WE'LL CHECK IN ON\nTHE GROUND AND SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE RIGHT AFTER\nTHIS.",

NOW ADMITTING TO EXAGGERATING\nTHE TRUTH BUT CONFUSING TO CONFESS TO ACCUSATIONS HE LIED\nABOUT GETTING ROBBED. BRAZILIAN POLICE SAY THE SWIMMER\nAND TEAMMATES VANDALIZED A GAS STATION BATHROOM AND URINATED ON\nTHE PROPERTY. LOCHTE AND POLICE DO BOTH AGREE\nON ONE THING. AT LEAST THEY APPEAR OR APPEAR\nTO AGREE ON THAT. WHERE THEY DIFFER IS THE ISSUE\nOF A GUN AND MONEY EXCHANGING HANDS.\nWAS IT A ROBBERY OR NOT? HERE IS WHAT HE TOLD NBC'S MATT\nLAUER. >> HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE WAY\nYOU'VE HANDLED YOURSELF SINCE SUNDAY MORNING, EARLY SUNDAY\nMORNING WHEN THIS ALL WENT DOWN? >> I MEAN, SINCE EVERYTHING\nTHAT'S HAPPENED, I KIND OF HAVE BEEN LAYING LOW, JUST NOT -- I\nMEAN, I HAD THOSE STATEMENTS. I'VE TALKED TO YOU.\nBUT BEFORE I WANTED TO GO OUT ON CAMERA, I WANTED TO REALLY MAKE\nSURE THOSE OTHER GUYS CAME BACK ON U.S. SOIL.\nWHICH I JUST FOUND OUT, THAT'S WHY I'M DOING THIS TODAY, JIMMY\nJUST CAME BACK, SET LAST PERSON TO COME BACK.\n>> LET ME PLAY DEVIL'S ADVOCATE THERE FOR A SECOND.\nBECAUSE HAD YOU COME OUT AND SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT EARLIER,\nGUNNAR AND JACK MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN PULLED OFF THAT PLANE AND\nJIMMY MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD HIS PASSPORT IMPOUNDED.\nIF YOU HAD COME FORWARD AND DONE AN INTERVIEW LIKE THIS AND TOLD\nTHE REAL STORY EARLIER, COULDN'T YOU HAVE TAKEN WAY THEIR\nPROBLEMS? >> OH, DEFINITELY.\nTHIS IS WHY I'M TAKING FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR MY ACTIONS\nBECAUSE IF I DIDN'T OVEREXAGGERATE THE STORY, TO\nWHAT I SAID WHEN I DID IT, WHEN IT FIRST HAPPENED WITH BILLY\nBUSH, AND YOURSELF AND I TOLD YOU THE FULL STORY, NONE OF THIS\nWOULD HAVE HAPPENED. WE WOULDN'T BE HERE, WE WOULDN'T\nBE SITTING HERE DISCUSSING THIS. >> SO WHEN YOU TALKED TO BILLY\nON SUNDAY AFTERNOON, YOU DIDN'T TELL HIM THE WHOLE TRUTH.\nWHEN YOU SPOKE WITH ME ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT BY PHONE, YOU\nDIDN'T TELL ME THE WHOLE TRUTH. >> I LEFT DETAILS OUT.\nWHICH, THAT'S WHY I'M IN THIS MESS.\nI LEFT CERTAIN THINGS OUT. I OVEREXAGGERATED SOME PARTS OF\nTHE STORY. >> ONE OF THE THINGS YOU PAIR TO\nHAVE EMBELLISHED WITH BILLY, IS YOU SAID AT SOME POINT AFTER YOU\nREFUSE TO SIT DOWN, SECURITY GUARD PUT THE GUN TO YOUR\nFOREHEAD AND COCKED IT. THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN?\n>> THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. THAT'S WHY I OVEREXAGGERATED\nTHAT PART. >> WHY DID DO YOU THAT?\n>> I DON'T KNOW WHY. YOU KNOW, IT WAS STILL -- HOURS\nAFTER THE INCIDENT HAPPENED. I WAS STILL INTOXICATED.\nI WAS STILL UNDER THE INFLUENCE. AND I'M NOT MAKING ME BEING\nINTOXICATED LIKE AN EXCUSE. I'M NOT DOING THAT AT ALL.\nIT WAS MY FAULT. AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT.\nI SHOULDN'T HAVE EVEN -- JUST KEPT IT AT LIKE, I'M NOT SAYING\nANYTHING. BUT I OVEREXAGGERATED THAT PART\nAND THE GUN WAS DRAWN BUT NOT AT MY FOREHEAD.\nIT WASN'T COCKED AT MY FOREHEAD.

I DON'T KNOW IF -- I WAS\nINTOXICATED SO I DON'T KNOW. ALL I KNOW IS THERE WAS A GUN\nPOINTED AT US AND WE WERE DEMANDED TO GIVE MONEY.\nWHETHER TO PAY FOR THE DAMAGES OF THE POSTER, WHETHER IT WAS SO\nEXTORTION OR WHETHER IT WAS A ROBBERY, LIKE I CAN'T -- I'M\nNOT -- I'M NOT EQUIPPED TO LIKE --\n>> EXCEPT I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT GUNNAR IN HIS STATEMENT TO\nPOLICE SAID AT SOME POINT SOMEONE WHO SPOKE ENGLISH WALKED\nOVER AND OFFERED TO TRANSLATE THIS ALTERCATION.\nAND HE MADE IT CLEAR THAT SECURITY GUARD WAS TELLING THE\nFOUR OF YOU, YOU NEED TO PAY FOR THAT STUFF, THAT DAMAGE BEFORE\nYOU CAN LEAVE HERE OR I'M GOING TO CALL THE POLICE.\nYOU UNDERSTOOD THAT AT THAT TIME, DIDN'T YOU?\n>> YEAH. SO WE TODAHAD TO GIVE THE MONEY.\n>> SO AT THAT POINT, THAT'S NOT A ROBBERY.\nYOU'RE STRIKING A DEAL. YOU'RE STRIKING A DEAL TO PAY\nFOR WHAT DAMAGE YOU'VE CAUSE SEWED HE DOESN'T CALL THE POLICE\nAND THIS DOESN'T BECOME A BIGGER INCIDENT.\nISN'T THAT FAIR? >> WE JUST WANTED TO GET OUT OF\nTHERE. THERE WAS A GUNPOINTED IN OUR\nDIRECTION. WE WERE FRIGHTENED.\nWE WANTED TO GET OUT OF THERE AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE.\nTHIS GUY SAID TO GIVE HIM MONEY. SO WE GAVE HIM MONEY AND WE\nWANTED TO GET OUT. >> THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A\nROBBERY. SOMEONE TARGETS YOU, TAKING YOUR\nMONEY, BELONGS AND VALUABLE POSSESS.\nTHIS GUY WAS NEGOTIATING A DEAL BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED ON THE\nWALK WAY AND YOU GUYS WERE ON THE OTHER END OF THE\nNEGOTIATION. >> THAT'S WHY PEOPLE CAN SEE IT\nIN MANY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. ALL WE KNOW IS THERE WAS A GUN\nPOINTED TO US AND WE WERE DEMANDED TO GIVE HIM MONEY.\nEND OF STORY. >> WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS THE\nFIRST FIRST YOU TOLD, RYAN, IS MUCH MORE ABOUT THE MEAN STREETS\nOF RIO. >> YES.\n>> AND THE VERSION WE HEAR NOW IS MUCH MORE ABOUT A NEGOTIATED\nSETTLEMENT TO COVER UP SOME DUMB BEHAVIOR.\n>> AND THAT'S WHY I'M TAKING FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT.\nAND BECAUSE I OVEREXAGGERATED THAT STORY AND IF I NEVER HAD\nDONE THAT WE WOULDN'T BE IN THIS MESS.\nTHOSE GUYS WOULD NEVER BE IN RIO OR WERE IN RIO -- NONE OF THIS\nWOULD HAVE HAPPENED AND IT WAS MY IMMATURE BEHAVIOR OF, YOU\nKNOW, GENTLEMEN JUST FINISHED. WE WERE WANTING TO CELEBRATE.\nAND WE HADN'T BEEN DRINKING OR ANYTHING FOR MONTHS BEFORE THAT.\nAND I DEFINITELY HAD TOO MUCH TO DRINK THAT NIGHT AND HE WAS VERY\nINTOXICATED.

HE IS STANDING BY IN YORK NEW\nYORK. DON, FIRST TO YOU.\nNOW THAT LOCHTE ISSUED THIS APOLOGY, ARE YOU HEARING\nANYTHING ON DISCIPLINARY ACTION? HAS ANYTHING CHANGED?\n>> I THINK THAT IS ALMOST CERTAINLY STILL TO COME BUT THE\nUNITED STATES OLYMPIC COMMITTEE MARTIN IS STILL TRYING TO KEEP\nTHEIR SUCCESSFUL AND CLEAN AND WELL-BEHAVED ATHLETES STILL IN\nTHE SPOTLIGHT AND THEY HAVE FOUND THAT HARD TO DO.\nSO ALLYSON FELIX AND SIMONE BILES AND OTHERS WERE THERE AND\nCEO OF THE OAC SCOTT BLACKMAN DID DISCUSS THIS BRIEFLY AND\nCONFIRMED FURTHER ACTION WILL BE TAKEN WHEN WE GET BACK TO THE\nUNITED STATES. I THINK THEY HAVE REALIZED THAT\nTHE MORE FUEL THAT IS POURED ON TO THIS FIRE, THE MORE OF THE\nSPOTLIGHT IS TAKEN FROM THE ATHLETES.\nTHEY WANT TO GET THE OLYMPICS OVER AND DONE WITH, GET BACK TO\nTHE UNITED STATES AND DEAL WITH IT THEN.\nBUT THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT THIS HAS BEEN A REALLY REALLY\nBIG PROBLEM FOR THE AMERICAN ATHLETES HERE.\nALL OF THEM.

WHAT DO YOU FEEL LEGALLY THIS\nIS? >> IT IS ODD TO ME.\nIT SEEMS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE LAST WEEK EVERYONE IS\nASTOUNDED THAT THE POLICE EITHER IN BRAZIL OR STATE SIDE MIGHT\nTAKE A POSITION THAT IT IS COMPLETELY OPPOSITE TO SOMEONE\nTHAT MIGHT BE CALLED A SUSPECT. THAT HAPPENED EVERY SINGLE DAY\nIN EVERY COURTHOUSE ACROSS THE LAND.\nTHE POLICE TAKE A POSITION THAT IS DIRECTLY OPPOSITE THAT OF A\nDEFENDANT. I'M HARDLY AN APOLL GIST FOR\nTHIS BEHAVIOR EXHIBITED BY LOCHTE THAT HE ADMITS TO.\nBUT AT THE SAME TIME, I WOULD RESPECTFULLY PUSH BACK A LITTLE\nBIT ON MATT LAUER. THOUGH IT WAS AN OUTSTANDING\nINTERVIEW, MATT LAUER SPEAKS OF IT BEING, THIS IS A NEGOTIATION.\n>> WITH A GUN. >> YEAH.\nTHERE AREN'T A LOT OF NEGOTIATIONS CARRIED ON IN THE\nUNITED STATES WITH ONE PARTY BRANDISHING A FIREARM.\nIT RAISES AN INTERESTING LEGAL QUESTION AS TO WHAT EXACTLY WAS\nBEING DONE WITH THE GUN. WAS IT AT HIS HIP.\nDOES IT MATTER IF IT IS OUT BY HIS BODY OR DOES IT MATTER IF IT\nIS POINTED RIGHT AT YOU? IT IS AN INTERESTING LEGAL\nQUESTION BUT TO SOME DEGREE RYAN LOCHTE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH\nABOUT HAVING A GUNPOINTED IN HIS DIRECTION.\nDID HE EXAGGERATE? YES.\nHE IS TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT, PROBABLY A LITTLE TOO\nLATE. BUT AGAIN AS CRIMINAL DEFENSE\nATTORNEY, HIS ADVISERS SURELY WAITED UNTIL HE WAS ABSOLUTELY\nCERTAIN HE WOULD NOT BE CALLED EXTRADITED BACK IT BRAZIL BEFORE\nHE WENT ON THE APOLOGY TOUR IN AN EFFORT TO SALVAGE HIS BRAND.\n>> THAT PART I FIGURED OUT. HE WOULDN'T BE SAYING WHEN A\nSAID IF IT WOULD STILL BE FOR THE PROSECUTION.\n>> LEE, LET ME ASK YOU THIS. WHAT DO YOU THINK THE FALL-OUT\nWILL BE? FOR SPONSORS AND DISCIPLINARY\nACTION? IS THIS GOING TO HAVE A LONG\nTERM IMPACT ON HIS CAREER? OR IS THIS JUST GOING TO PASS?\n>> THE LAWYERS WANT TO TAKE A VIKT POSITION OF SITTING BACK\nAND DOING THE FACTS AND WHERE FROM MARKETING STANDPOINT, THE\nISSUE IS BRAND. SO THIS IS A --\n>> SO WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF THE BRAND?\n>> THE IMPACT OF THE BRAND IS DEVASTATING.\nBECAUSE FOR A WHOLE WEEK YOU'VE HAD NEWS CYCLE AVENUES CYCLE,\nYESTERDAY IN NEW YORK, YOU HAVE UGLY AMERICAN ON THE FRONT OF\nONE OF THE TABLOIDS AND THE OTHER ONE IS THE LOCHTE MONSTER.\nAND IT'S GONE ON AND ON AND ON WITHOUT ANY REACTION AND IT\nBRANDS HIM IN A NEGATIVE WAY AND HE'S GOT A SERIES OF\nENDORSEMENTS. I THINK THEY WILL BACK AWAY.\nSECOND THING IS, RESENTMENT AMONG THE OTHER OLYMPIANS\nCOMPETING BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN DROWN OUT.\nNOW AS TO SANCTIONS I WOULD GUESS THAT THEY ARE ARE GOING TO\nSLAP HIM WITH A BAND AND THE U.S. OC CERTAINLY THE SWIMMING\nFEDERATION FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME.\nLOOK, HE DIDN'T -- HE DIDN'T COMMIT MURDER AND WITH THE\nPROPER APOLOGY, WE LOOK TO FORGIVE AND HE COULD GO ON.\nTHE COME BACK FOLLOWS THE FOLLOW THE HIGH AND MIGHTY.\nBUT THIS IS LINGERED FOR SO LONG WITHOUT AN APPROPRIATE RESPONSE.\nIT'S ALL BEEN LEGALISTIC. IT HASN'T BEEN THE HUNDREDS OF\nMILLIONS OF PEOPLE WATCHING THESE BROADCASTS WHO THINK OF\nHIM AS A -- SOMEONE WHO HAS NO REGARD FOR OTHER PEOPLE.\n>> LEE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DANNY, THANKS FOR YOUR INSIGHTS\nALSO. I HOPE WE WON'T TALK ABOUT THIS\nMUCH MORE BUT WE WILL SEE AS",

HE WOULD BE 36 IN TOKYO.\nTHAT'S A BIG FOUR YEARS FOR A SWIMMER.\nHE DID WIN ONE GOLD MEDAL HERE IN THE RELAY.\nHIS OLYMPIC TRIALS A MONTH OR TWO AGO AND HIS GAMES HERE WERE\nNOWHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS THE PREVIOUS OLYMPICS.\nHE'S CERTAINLY ON THE DOWNSIDE OF HIS CAREER.\nANYTHING'S POSSIBLE AS WE'VE SEEN, BUT WHEN HE'S SUSPENDED\nFOR SOME LENGTH OF TIME, THEN IF HE HAS A CHANCE TO COME BACK,\nSURE HE'S GOING TO HAVE A SHOT AT IT, BUT I THINK IT'S VERY\nDIFFICULT FOR HIM TO COME BACK AS A SWIMMER.\n>> WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS INTERVIEW, HE GETS EMOTIONAL\nWHEN HE SPEAKS ABOUT HIS TEAMMATES.\nWHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REPERCUSSIONS AND THE\nCONSEQUENCES HERE, SHOULD HE BE BANNED?\nYOU SAY HE'S GOING TO BE SUSPENDED FOR SOME LENGTH OF\nTIME. SHOULD HE BE BANNED?\nAND SHOULD HIS PUNISHMENT BE DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHER THREE?\n>> I THINK IT WILL BE DIDFFEREN THAN THE OTHER THREE BECAUSE OF\nTHE NATURE OF HIS BEHAVIOR. THE OTHER THREE WERE MUCH\nYOUNGER. IF THEY'RE BANNED FOR THREE TO\nSIX MONTHS, WHICH WERE MICHAEL FPH\nPHELPS'S TIME PERIOD, I THINK THEY COULD COME BACK FROM IT.\nTHE USOC ARE LOOKING FOR AN APOLOGY LIKE WHAT MICHAEL PHELPS\nDID, QUICK SUSSINCT AND TOTAL. >> SO APPRECIATE YOUR INPUT ON\nTHIS STORY.",

I TOOK AWAY FROM THAT.\nTHAT'S WHAT, I THINK, HURTS ME THE MOST, IS THAT ALL THAT --\nEVERYONE'S JUST WATCHING MY IMMATURE ANTICS.\nAND I'M JUST -- I'M EMBARRASSED. >> WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE OF RIO?\nTHEY DEALT WITH ALL THE HEADLINES GOING INTO THE GAMES\nABOUT POLLUTION AND VIOLENCE AND CRIME.\nAND HERE COME THIS IS STORY WITH ONE OF THE HIGHEST PROFILE U.S.\nATHLETES SAYING I GOT HELD UP AT GUNPOINT ON THE STREETS OF RIO.\nWHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THEM NOW? >> HOW SORRY I AM.\nAND MY DEEP EST APOLOGIES.

HE IS SAYING MUCH MORE AND\nTHAT'S WHAT HE SHOULD BE DOING. CLEARLY HE HAS GOT A P.R. FIRM\nWORKING WITH HIM AND WHAT A TERRIBLE JOB THEY HAVE DONE.\nTHE APOLOGY THAT WAS MORE OF AN EXPLANATION CAME OUT A COUPLE OF\nDAYS AGO. IT WAS LONG, IT WAS WINDING, IT\nWAS STILL TRYING TO EXPLAIN THINGS AWAY.\nHE APOLOGIZED TO HIS SPONSORS FIRST BEFORE HE APOLOGIZED TO\nTHE PEOPLE RUNNING THE RIO OLYMPICS.\nTHAT WAS CLEARLY NOT WELL RECEIVED SO NOW THEY'RE COMING\nBACK WITH THIS. IT'S HARD NOT TO LOOK AT RYAN\nLOCHTE AND SAY HE'S DOING THIS ONLY BECAUSE HE HAS TO BECAUSE\nHE REALIZES HOW MUCH TROUBLE HE'S IN.\n>> SO YOU BELIEVE HE IS SORRY? >> IT SOUNDS LIKE HE'S SORRY,\nBUT THE MOTIVATION FOR BEING SORRY -- I THINK THIS AVALANCHE\nOF NEGATIVE PUBLICITY HAS HIT HIM.\nHE'S A SWIMMER. HE'S 32 YEARS OLD.\nHE'S NOT A TEENAGER. THERE'S SO MANY QUESTIONS TO ASK\nABOUT HIS BEHAVIOR BASED ON HIS BEING 32 YEARS OLD.\nBUT TO HAVE PRODEPOFESSIONALS AD YOU, THIS IS A MAN WHO IS\nSUSPENDED AND IS TRYING TO GET A LESSER SUSPENSION.\n>> HE DID TALK ABOUT HIS HOPES FOR THE FUTURE, SAYING THAT HE\nWANTS TO CONTINUE SWIMMING IF THEY ALLOW HIM TO DO SO.\nWE KNOW MICHAEL PHELPS CAME BACK FROM TWO DUIS AND LOOK AT WHERE\nHE WOUND UP. HE DID THAT BECAUSE HE WAS\nCONTRITE, HE TOOK RESPONSIBILITY.\nDO YOU THINK THAT IS POSSIBLE FOR RYAN LOCHTE?\n>> I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE THAT HE WILL SWIM AGAIN AND BE ABLE TO\nBE A SPOKESPERSON FOR USA SWIMMING AND SHOW UP AT EVENTS\nAND DO MEET AND GREETS THAT ALL ALUMS KIND OF DO.\nTHERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT HE WAS EVEN GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE\nTHE 2020 OLYMPIC TEAM.

HE IS CLEARLY BEING ADVISED, AND\nHE REALIZES THAT THE SILENCE FOR FIVE DAYS WAS DEVASTATING AS\nEVENTS UNFOLDED IN RIO AND HE OF COURSE WAS BACK SAFELY AT HOME,\nALL THE REMNANTS OF THIS DRUNKEN RAMPAGE AND RIDICULOUS FIASCO\nWERE PLAYING OUT, AND HE WAS REALLY NOT SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT\nIT. >> WE KNOW HE CERTAINLY WAS\nADVISED, NOT ONLY ADVISED BUT ADVISED BY ONE OF THE BEST\nCRISIS PR MANAGERS IN THE BUSINESS, MATTHEW HILTIG.\nHE DIDN'T JUST GIVE THAT INTERVIEW TO NBC.\nHE GAVE A SECOND INTERVIEW TO GLOBAL TELEVISION, BRAZILIAN\nTELEVISION NETWORK, IN AN EFFORT TO DIRECTLY APOLOGIZE TO THE\nPEOPLE OF BRAZIL. HOW IMPORTANT DO YOU THINK THAT\nIS? >> Reporter: OH, I THINK THAT'S\nHUGE, POPPY. BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW AND SO MANY\nPEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS STORY NOW, THE NARRATIVE\nHAS ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT THE CONCERNS ABOUT BRAZILIAN STREET\nCRIME. AND WHEN ALMOST A WEEK AGO NOW,\nWHEN WE FIRST HEARD THE NEWS THAT RYAN LOCHTE SAID THAT HE\nHAD A GUN PUT TO HIS FOREHEAD, IT PLAYED INTO EVERY STEREOTYPE\nAND CONCERN THAT PEOPLE HAD FROM AROUND THE WORLD WHO COME TO RIO\nFOR THESE OLYMPIC GAMES. WE KNOW OF COURSE THAT THAT\nSTORY WAS AT LEAST PARTIALLY FABRICATED, AND NOW RYAN IS\nTELLING ANOTHER STORY. SO YES, I THINK IT'S FANTASTIC\nTHAT HE HAS MADE THE DECISION TO SPEAK TO THE PEOPLE OF RIO,\nBECAUSE THEY WERE SO AFFECTED BY THE STORY THAT HE MADE UP.\n>> LET'S GET TO THE CONSEQUENCES HERE.\nYOUR SOURCES TELLING YOU THAT HE WILL INDEED BE SUSPENDED.\nI MEAN, FOR HOW LONG, WHAT IS THE PUNISHMENT GOING TO LOOK\nLIKE? >> Reporter: AS YOU MAY HAVE\nHEARD, AS REPORTED EARLIER TODAY, THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC\nCOMMITTEE IS NOW SETTING UP A COMMISSION TO LOOK INTO THIS.\nWHAT I THINK THAT DOES, POPPY, IS ELONGATES THE CONVERSATION.\nTHE U.S. OLYMPIC COMMITTEE WILL BE PLAYING A BIG ROLE.\nUSA SWIMMING, THE NATIONAL GOVERNING BODY TO THE SPORT, IS\nGOING TO BE PLAYING A BIG ROLE IN THIS.\nAND NOW THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE.\nWHO KNOWS WHO WILL GO FIRST, ALTHOUGH I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED\nIF IT'S USA SWIMMING IN TERMS OF PUNISHMENT BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN\nSO NO-NONSENSE ON MICHAEL PHELPS AND OTHERS OVER THE YEARS.\nTHIS MAY BE MORE ELONGATED THAN WE THOUGHT.\nA DECISION MAY NOT COME IN THE NEXT WEEK OR TWO JUST BECAUSE SO\nMANY PEOPLE ARE NOW LOOKING AT THESE FOUR SWIMMERS, ESPECIALLY\nLOCHTE, AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PUNISH THEM.\n>> CHRISTINE, LOCHTE IS 32, HE'S CLOSER TO THE END OF HIS CAREER\nTHAN THE OTHER THREE SWIMMERS THAT WERE WITH HIM THAT ARE MUCH\nYOUNGER. WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR THEM?\n>> Reporter: FOR THEM, LET'S SAY THEY'RE SUSPENDED, AND I DON'T\nTHINK WHAT THE LENGTH WOULD BE, OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE\nNONE OF THIS HAS HAPPENED YET. LET'S SAY MICHAEL PHELPS IS\nSUSPENDED FOR SIX MONTHS FOR DRUNK DRIVING, THEY MAY STILL BE\nBACK FOR THE NEXT OLYMPIC GAMES. RYAN LOCHTE, IT'S HARD TO\nIMAGINE HIM AT AGE 36 COMING BACK TO THE OLYMPIC GAMES.\nI THINK HE WOULD ALSO GET A BIGGER SUSPENSION SIMPLY BECAUSE\nHE WAS CLEARLY THE RINGLEADER, AND FROM THE STORIES THE OTHERS\nTOLD, IT SOUNDS LIKE LOCHTE MISBEHAVED IN WAYS THAT WERE\nPARTICULARLY EMBARRASSING TO THE OLYMPIC COMMITTEE AS A\nREPRESENTATIVE OF OUR NATION AS AN ATHLETE AT THESE GAMES.\n>> CHRISTINE BRENNAN, PHENOMENAL REPORTING ALL WEEK ON THIS.\nAND THE ACTUAL GAMES AND THE WONDERFUL THINGS OUT OF THE\nOLYMPICS THAT MATTER THE MOST.

ONE THING I THINK THAT A LOT OF\nPEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT IS WHEN MATT LAUER SAID, SO ARE YOU\nWILLING TO NOW SAY IT WASN'T ROBBERY?\nBECAUSE THAT WAS REALLY THE ONE POINT, IT WAS ROBBERY, WE WERE\nTHE VICTIMS IN THIS WHOLE THING. AND MATT GAVE HIM THAT OPENING\nTO SAY ARE YOU WILLING NOW TO SAY IT WASN'T ROBBERY.\nHE SAID, WELL, IT COULD BE ROBBERY, COULD BE MAKING AMENDS\nAND RESTITUTION -- >> WELL, I KIND OF FELT\nTHREATENED BECAUSE THE GUY HAD A GUN.\nORIGINALLY THEY WERE IN A TAXI. THEY WERE PULLED OUT BY SOMEBODY\nPRETENDING TO BE A COP. THE GUN WAS TO HIS HEAD.\nI MEAN, THIS WAS NOT JUST EMBELLISHED, THIS WAS FICTION.\nBUT LET'S GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL STORY.\nNBC'S PAID BILLIONS FOR THE OLYMPICS, AIRING THE INTERVIEWS.\n>> RIGHT. >> AND LOCHTE MAKES THESE\nCHARGES, WE SAW THE REPORTER SAY AND THIS WAS A VERY BRAVE THING\nFOR HIM TO DO TO DEFY THE GUNMEN.\nSHOULD THE PRESS HAVE FALLEN FOR THIS?\nIT ALWAYS SEEMS LIKE THE STORY -- ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME\nSOMETHING WRONG WITH THE STORY BUT I DIDN'T THINK HE WAS MAKING\nIT UP.

PLUS THE ASPECT OF THE OLYMPICS,\nTHE SALACIOUS, THE TABLOID ASPECT THAT WE DIDN'T REALLY\nGET, THERE WAS THE GABBY DOUGLAS ISSUE THAT CAME UP PEOPLE WERE\nTALKING ABOUT, BUT THEN RATINGS WERE DOWN WITH THE OLYMPICS.\nTHE SEATS WERE EMPTY IN THE OLYMPICS.\nSO THIS KIND OF FIT INTO ANOTHER KIND OF WAY TO TALK ABOUT\nSOMETHING WHEN MAYBE SOME OF THE EVENTS WEREN'T GETTING THE KIND\nOF BUZZ. SO I THINK IT MADE SENSE THAT\nTHE PRESS ACCEPTED IT BECAUSE THE WAY THAT BILLY BUSH KIND OF\nGRABBED HIM, SAW HIM IN THE STORE AND THEN GRABBED HIM.\n>> RIGHT.

TURKEY, OF COURSE, IS A NATO\nALLY AND CENTRAL PLAYER IN THE U.S. FIGHT AGAINST ISIS, WHICH\nIS WHY THERE ARE CONCERNS IN WASHINGTON OVER TURKISH\nPRESIDENT ERDOGAN'S WARMING TIES WITH RUSSIA.\nBUT IN THE WAKE OF THIS WEEKEND'S MASSACRE AT THAT\nWEDDING IN TURKEY, WHAT CAN WE EXPECT GOING FORWARD WITH OUR\nNATO ALLY? JOINING ME NOW TO TALK ABOUT\nTHIS IS RETIRED NAVY CAPTAIN BOB WELLS, A FORMER NATIONAL\nSECURITY ADVISER TO VICE PRESIDENT DICK CHENEY.\nCAPTAIN WELLS, GOOD TO HAVE YOU. >> THANK YOU, ARTHEL.\n>> LOTS TO TALK ABOUT. LET'S START HERE.\nLAST MONTH, TURKEY'S PRESIDENT CALLED ON NATO TO DO MORE TO\nFIGHT ISIS. IS NATO EQUIPPED TO ANSWER THE\nCALL? AND ARE THE NATO ALLIES DOING\nENOUGH TO ASSIST TURKEY, AND IN WHAT AREAS IS NATO'S HELP MOST\nNEEDED? >> I THINK THE CALL IS\nIMPORTANT. AND CERTAINLY FOCUSING ON TURKEY\nI THINK WOULD BE THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE.\nHOW WELL HAVE THEY BEEN AN ALLY? CERTAINLY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE\nCOUP ATTEMPT WAS THE GENESIS OF MR. ERDOGAN'S CALL FOR\nADDITIONAL HELP FROM NATO. THE TURKISH MILITARY IS REALLY\nHAMPERED BY THE POST COUP ENVIRONMENT.\nTHEY DO NEED HELP. I THINK NATO COULD HELP WITH\nADDITIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND WARNING CAPABILITY.\nTHEY ARE ALREADY HELPING IN TURKEY AT INCIRLIK AIR BASE ABLE\nTO DO MISSIONS INSIDE OF SYRIA AND ALSO SUPPORTING GREATER\nFREEDOM OF MOVEMENT OF NATO FORCES, IF THAT WOULD BE\nSOMETHING THAT THE TURKISH WOULD WELCOME.\nESPECIALLY DURING IN THAT KEYBOARDER AREA WHERE THIS\nLATEST SUICIDE ATTACK OCCURRED. >> A COUPLE OF THINGS THERE\nPOPPING INTO MY MIND BASED ON WHAT YOU JUST SAID, CAPTAIN\nWELLS. FIRST OF ALL, YOU'VE GOT RUSSIA\nNOW FLYING, BEING ALLOWED TO FLY OUT OF INCIRLIK AS WELL.\nWHAT DOES THAT MEAN? AND ALSO THE U.S. HAD, YOU KNOW,\nWARNED TURKEY IN THE PAST SAYING HEY, LOOK, YOU'VE GOT TO DO\nSOMETHING ABOUT THIS POROUS BORDER BETWEEN TURKEY AND SYRIA.\nTHAT'S COME BACK TO BITE THEM. >> INDEED IT HAS.\nI RECALL JUDITH MILLER ON YOUR PREVIOUS SEGMENT MENTIONING THE\nNUMBER OF TIMES THE UNITED STATES DIPLOMATS HAVE REINFORCED\nTHAT PARTICULAR MESSAGE WITH REGARD TO HAVING TO DEAL WITH\nTHE BORDER. ON INCIRLIK AND THE RUSSIAN, THE\nACCESS TO THE AIR BASE IN INCIRLIK, I DISCOUNT THAT\nSOMEWHAT WITH REGARD TO THE GREATER INTERESTS OF TURKEY,\nESPECIALLY THE GREATER INTERESTS WITH NATO ITSELF.\nYOU MENTIONED VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN HEADING OUT TO MEET WITH\nTURKEY AND PRESIDENT ERDOGAN COMING UP IN ANKARA NEXT WEEK.\nIT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT BEFORE HE GETS TO ANKARA, VICE\nPRESIDENT BIDEN IS ALSO GOING TO THE BALTIC STATES.\nHE'LL BE METING WITH THE PRESIDENTS OF LATVIA, ESTONIA,\nLATVIA AND HE IS ALSO GOING TO GO TO SWEDEN.\nRUSSIA IS FRONT AND CENTER WITH REGARD TO THE GEOPOLITICS HERE.\nI THINK MR. ERDOGAN IS TRYING TO LEVERAGE A NEW POLICY WITH\nRUSSIA AGAINST THE UNITED STATES AS THESE OTHER ISSUES BETWEEN\nU.S. AND TURKEY GET UNPACKED. >> YEAH, BECAUSE AS YOU WELL\nKNOW, WHAT YOU'RE POINTING TO NOW IS TURKEY'S IMPROVED TIES\nWITH RUSSIA IN THE ANTI-ISIS FIGHT HAS CONCERNED THE WEST.\nI MEAN, WHAT HAS THE U.S. DONE OR PERHAPS NOT DONE TO OPEN THE\nDOOR TO THIS RENEWED POLITICAL COZINESS BETWEEN PUTIN AND\nERDOGAN? >> I THINK WE'VE BEEN BEHIND IN\nTERMS OF OUR DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS. I NOTE THAT YOU HAVE TO FOCUS ON\nTURKEY AS A KEY ALLY, AS WAS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY AND WAS\nNOTED THROUGHOUT THE WEEK. IT'S AN INCREDIBLYTANT\nPARTNER IN THIS ENTIRE ANTI-TERRORISM, ANTI-ISIS FIGHT\nWITH SYRIA. ALSO THE BROADER MIDDLE EAST\nWITH REGARD TO PEACE. ISTANBUL AND ANKARA ARE KEY,\nPOLITICAL HUBS WITH REGARD TO COMMUNICATION IN THE MIDDLE\nEAST. I THINK THE UNITED STATES IS\nPLAYING CATCH-UP. I THINK MR. BIDEN'S TRIP IS A\nLITTLE BIT LATE. I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN\nTHERE ABOUT A MONTH AGO AFTER THE COUP.\nI NOTE THAT GENERAL DUNFORD, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF\nSTAFF WENT THROUGHOUT TO MEET WITH THE TURKISH MILITARY ABOUT\nTWO WEEKS OF THE COUP TO REASSURE A TREND, AN ALLY THAT\nWE'RE THERE WITH YOU STILL. I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO\nGET BACK ON STEP WITH REGARD TO THE RELATIONSHIP.\nWELL STILL HAVE QUITE A BIT OF THE MOMENTUM FROM THE WARSAW\nNATO SUMMIT IN JULY. AND I THINK TURKEY WILL PICK THE\nRIGHT CHOICE STILL OVERALL WITH REGARD TO THEIR NATIONAL\nINTERESTS AS OPPOSED TO THE PERSONAL INTERESTS SOMETIMES\nPRESIDENT ERDOGAN. >> MORE QUESTIONS IN MY MIND.\nBUT I'M JUST TOLD THAT I HAVE TO LEAVE THERE IT, CAPTAIN BOB\nWELLS. ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE YOU.\nAND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PERSPECTIVE, SIR.\n>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, ARTHEL. GOOD TO SEE YOU.\n>> THANK YOU. SAME HERE.\nERIC? >> WELL, ARTHEL, WHILE WE'RE\nDEEMING WITH TURKEY AND THAT FUTURE OF THAT NATO ALLY, THE\nU.S. AND THE WEST HAVE VOWED TO DESTROY THE RADICAL ISLAMIC\nTERRORISTS OF ISIS. BUT WHAT WILL BE THE RESULT OF\nTHAT? FROM IRAN, CONTINUING OF TESTING\nOF BALLISTIC MISSILES TO REPORTEDLY BACKING AS MANY AS\n100,000 FIGHTERS IN IRAQ THERE ARE TROUBLING PREDICTIONS ABOUT\nTHE FUTURE OF THE MIDDLE EAST. FOX NEWS'S LUCAS TOMLINSON HAS\nMORE. >> DESPITE CLAIMS BY THE U.S.\nCOALITION TO HAVE KILLED 45,000 ISIS FIGHTERS IN IRAQ AND SYRIA,\nA NEW FEAR IS SWEEPING THE U.S. INTELLIGENCE RANKS.\nSHOULD THE ISLAMIC STATE BE DEFEATED, IT MAY SOON BE\nREPLACED BY ANOTHER ANTI-AMERICAN FORCE.\nU.S. MILITARY OFFICIALS TELL FOX THERE ARE NOW UP TO 100,000\nIRANIAN-BACKED FIGHTERS INSIDE IRAQ BATTLING ISIS.\nTHESE ARE THE SAME FIGHTERS WHO RECENTLY THREATENED THE NEARLY\n4,000 U.S. ADVISERS CURRENTLY ON THE GROUND THERE, CALLING THEM\nAN OCCUPYING FORCE. LAST MONTH FIREBRAND SHIA CLERIC\nMUQTADA AL SADR, A LONG-TIME ENEMY OF THE UNITED STATES SAID\nTHIS ABOUT AMERICAN TROOPS, QUOTE, THEY ARE A TARGET FOR US.\nA DECADE AGO THESE SAME IRAN-BACKED FORCES KILLED\nHUNDREDS OF U.S. SOLDIERS IN IRAQ.\n>> DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY SOLDIERS, MARINES UNDERNEATH\nYOUR COMMAND WERE KILLED BY IRANIAN ACTIVITIES?\n>> THE NUMBER HAS BEEN RECENTLY QUOTED AS ABOUT 500.\nWE WERE ALWAYS ABLE TO ATTRIBUTE THE CASUALTIES THAT WE HAD TO\nIRANIAN ACTIVITY, ALTHOUGH MANY TIMES WE SUSPECTED IT WAS\nIRANIAN ACTIVITY. >> ARMED WITH A FRESH INFUSION\nOF CASH FROM THE NUCLEAR DEAL, MILITARY ANALYSTS FEAR IRAN'S\nINFLUENCE IN THE REGION IS GROWING.\nTHE RISE OF THE MILITIAS IS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES LOSING INFLUENCE INSIDE OF IRAQ.\n>> THE IRANIAN NUCLEAR DEAL HAS FREED UP BILLIONS IN BILLIONS OF\nDOLLARS IN CASH FOR IRAN TO SUPPORT THESE MILITIAS INSIDE OF\nIRAQ AS WELL AS INSIDE SYRIA. >> THE U.S. MILITARY SAYS IF\nIRAQI FORCES WANT HELP FROM IRAN, THAT'S UP TO THEM.\n>> IF THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ CHOOSES TO BRING IN OTHER\nADVISERS, THAT'S AN ISSUE FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ.\nWE ARE NOT COORDINATING WITH THE IRANIANS IN ANY WAY.\n>> BUT ONE OF THOSE ADVISERS IS THE MAN WHO LEADS THE\nIRANIAN-BACKED FIGHTERS INSIDE IRAQ.\nIN FEBRUARY 2009, THE U.S. TREASURY DEPARTMENT DESIGNATED\nHIM A TERRORIST.

IN THE BEGINNING, THERE WERE\nMOSTLY REFUGEES GOING BACK AND FORTH.\nAND A FEW PEOPLE MEETING THERE TO DISCUSS POLITICS WITH THE\nTURKISH GOVERNMENT, AND A FEW JIHADIS OF VARIOUS SORTS MEETING\nTHERE OR MEETING NEAR THERE. BUT THE IDEA THAT TURKEY WOULD\nNOT SHUT THIS DOWN, THE AMERICANS HAD SPOKEN OFTEN TO\nTHE TURKS ABOUT THEIR QUIET ACQUIESCENCE TO JIHADIS GOING\nBACK AND FORTH. AND THE AMERICANS HAVE WARNED\nTHE TURKS AGAIN AND AGAIN THAT ONE DAY SOMEHOW, SOMEWHERE THIS\nWAR WOULD SPILL BACK AND THE JIHADIS WOULD TAKE THEIR REVENGE\nON TURKEY, WHICH SEEMS TO BE WHAT'S HAPPENED, ESPECIALLY\nBECAUSE THE TURKS ARE NOW WORKING SO CLOSELY WITH THE\nRUSSIANS, WHICH IS BY THE WAY GOING TO BE ANOTHER SOURCE OF\nCONVERSATION BETWEEN JOE BIDEN AND THE TURKISH LEADERSHIP WHEN\nJOE BIDEN ARRIVES ON WEDNESDAY. >> VICE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO\nHAVE TO REALLY TALK TO THEM, LAY THE LAW DOWN, PERHAPS.\nBECAUSE THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE FOREIGN MINISTER ARE TALKING\nABOUT HAVING RUSSIAN TROOPS OR RUSSIAN FORCES POTENTIALLY STATIONED THE AIR BASE THERE.\nTURKEY IS A NATO ALLY AND TO HAVE THE RUSSIANS THERE?\n>> THE RUSSIANS THERE AT A PLACE THAT HAS TACTICAL NUCLEAR\nWEAPONS. >> HOPEFULLY THEY'RE TAKEN OUT\nBEFORE THAT HAPPENS.

WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS WHEN\nYOU'RE DEALING WITH A MIND-SET AND A PHILOSOPHY THAT WILL\nSACRIFICE THE INNOCENCE THAT WILL TARGET A WEDDING AND USE A\n12 TO 14-YEAR-OLD CHILD TO DO THIS?\n>> IT REMINDS ME OF THE WOMEN THAT I INTERVIEWED IN AN ISRAELI\nJAIL, PALESTINIAN FAILED FEMALE SUICIDE BOMBERS, ALL OF WHOM\nSAID IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER THAT THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR\nCOMMUNITIES HAD BEEN COMPLICIT IN THEIR WILLINGNESS TO KILL\nTHEMSELVES AND A LOT OF INNOCENT PEOPLE WITH THEM IN ORDER TO\nMAKE A STATEMENT FOR THEIR CAUSE.\nIT IS, AS YOU SAID, A SIGN OF UTTER DEPRAVITY.\nAND IT ALSO SHOWS HOW HARD IT'S GOING TO BE TO DEFEAT ISIS.\nIT'S NOT ENOUGH TO BOMB THEM.

IN THE HOURS AFTER THAT, A BUNCH\nOF NEWS ORGANIZATIONS BEGINNING WITH BUZZ FEED, WHICH IS AN\nONLINE FASHION BLOG WITH A NEWS COMPONENT, RAN HEADLINES ON\nSTORIES LIKE THIS. IN REVERSAL, IT SAYS, TRUMP\nINDICATES TO HISPANIC LEADERS OPENNESS TO LEGALIZATION FOR\nIMMIGRANTS. NBC NEWS SAYS GOP HISPANICS\nTRUMP OPEN TO EASING HIS POLL LICKS ON UNDOCUMENTED.\nDAILY NEWS TALKS ABOUT HE WILL BE HUMANE AND EFFICIENT.\nWE TALKED TO SENATOR JEFF SESSIONS.\nWE'LL GET TO THAT IN A MOMENT BECAUSE ON THE SURFACE YOU'D\nREAD THESE HEADLINES AND THINK, WOW, THIS MUST BE A HUGE\nREVERSAL FOR DONALD TRUMP, THAT HE'S GOING TO SHIFT HIS\nIMMIGRATION POLICY, BUT HE'S TALKED ABOUT BEING HUMANE IN THE\nPAST, OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS AND INTO LAST YEAR.\nLISTEN TO WHAT HE'S HAD TO SAY. LISTEN.\n>> WE'RE GOING TO DO IT IN A VERY HUMANE FASHION.\nBELIEVE ME. I HAVE A BIGGER HEART THAN YOU\nDO. I'M GOING TO DO IT IN A VERY\nHUMANE FASHION. WE'RE ROUNDING THEM UP IN A\nHUMANE WAY AND A NICE WAY AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE HAPPY\nBECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE LEGALIZED.\nWE'RE GOING TO HAVE A DEPORTATION FORCE AND YOU'RE\nGOING TO DO IT HUMANELY. >> HE TALKED ABOUT THE\nDEPORTATION OF 11 MILLIONMIGRAN COUNTRY AND HE'S GOING TO BUILD\nA WALL BUT THERE WILL BE A BIG BEAUTIFUL DOOR AND SOME WILL BE\nALLOWED BACK IN. >> THIS WAS A BIG STICKING POINT\nIN THE PRIMARIES. HIS REPUBLICAN RIVALS SAYS\nYOU'RE CRAZY, YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO ROUND UP 11 MILLION PEOPLE.\nHE'S SAYING WE'RE GOING TO DO IT HUMANELY AND HAVE A PLAN TO GET\nIT DONE. >> TALK ABOUT A RED HERRING.\nHERE IS THE POINT. AMERICA NEEDS AN IMMIGRATION\nSYSTEM THAT SERVES AMERICAN CITIZENS, ALL AMERICAN CITIZENS.\nOUR CURRENT SYSTEM SERVES A NARROW SLICE AT THE TOP WHO\nBENEFIT FROM CHEAP HOUSEHOLD LABOR AND CHEAP WORKING WAGES\nAND EVERYONE ELSE SUFFERS. THAT'S THE TRUTH.\nNOBODY SAYS IT OUT LOUD. JEFF SESSIONS SAYS IT OUT LOUD.\nWE TALKED TO SESSIONS A MINUTE AGO.\nHERE IS WHAT HE SAID ABOUT IT. >> HE HAD A GREAT MEETING WITH\nPEOPLE WHO HAD DIFFERENT IDEAS, AND I UNDERSTAND -- I WASN'T\nTHERE -- BUT HE HAD A GOOD DISCUSSION.\nHE LISTENED TO ALL THE DIFFERENT VIEWS.\nLOOK, WE NEED A LAWFUL SYSTEM OF IMMIGRATION.\nTRUMP IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR AND CORRECT ON THAT.\nWE MUST END THE LAWLESSNESS FIRST.\nWE CAN'T TALK ABOUT THESE OTHER ISSUES UNTIL THAT OCCURS.\nI THINK THAT REMAINS HIS FIRM POSITION.\n>> HE TALKED A LOT MORE ABOUT  >> AND HAVING A SYSTEM THAT\nSERVES THE COUNTRY. TRUMP TALKING ABOUT THE WALL AND\nDEPORTATION ALLOWS THE OPPONENTS NOT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE.\nIF YOU'RE LETTING IN TWICE THE NUMBER OF IMMIGRANTS AS THE\nNUMBER OF JOBS YOU'RE CREATING, WHOSE INTEREST IS THAT IN?\nWE'RE NOT EVEN DEBAING THAT. >> I THINK PEOPLE STILL WANT TO\nKNOW WHAT TRUMP'S POSITION IS. WE HAD TWO INTERVIEWS AND WE HAD\nA HARD TIME GETTING ANSWERS. >> I COULDN'T AGREE MORE AND\nTRUMP IS GOING TO EXPLAIN THAT. I THINK THE KEY IS LEGAL\nIMMIGRATION. OUR ECONOMY CANNOT SUPPORT A\nMILLION LOW-SKILLED WORKERS EVERY YEAR.\nNOTHING AGAINST THEM. I THINK THEY'RE MOSTLY GOOD\nPEOPLE BUT IS IT GOOD FOR US? >> MEANWHILE S THERE A DOUBLE\nSTANDARD IN THE MEDIA? IF HE FLIPPED AROUND TO OTHER\nCHANNELS YOU MAY HAVE SEEN OR MAY NOT HAVE SEEN COVERAGE OF\nTRUMP SUPPORTERS BEING HARASSED AT A FUND-RAISER.\nTHEY WERE SPIT ON, YELLED AT, ANTI-TRUMP SIGNS.\nLISTEN IN TO SOME OF WHAT UNFOLDED AT THIS TRUMP\nFUND-RAISER. [ BLEEP ]\n[ BLEEP ] [ BLEEP ].\n>> RACIST! >> RACIST!\n>> [ BLEEP ]. >> IS IT HOW OKAY THE FIRST\nAMENDMENT OF THESE TRUMP SUPPORTERS' RIGHTS IS INFRINGED\nUPON. IMAGINE IF IT WAS HAPPENING AT A\nHILLARY CLINTON FUND-RAISER AND HOW MUCH IT WOULD BE COVERED,\nWALL TO WALL. >> IMAGINE IF THERE WAS NO FOX\nNEWS. THE LEFT IS SO OUTRAGED BY FOX\nNEWS. THE HILLARY PEOPLE.\nIF IT WEREN'T FOR US, THIS WOULDN'T BE ON THE AIR AND\nNEITHER WOULD THE RIOTS THAT TOOK PLACE LAST WEEK IN\nMILWAUKEE. IT WOULDN'T BE COVERED.\nIT WOULD BE WRITTEN OFF AS A LOCAL STORY AND SOME LOCAL\nAFFILIATE WOULD COVER IT. NO NATIONAL NEWS ORGANIZATION\nWOULD PAY ANY ATTENTION.

THE TIMING, MORE THAN A LITTLE\nCURIOUS. DONALD TRUMP OF LATE HAS BEEN\nMUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE IN QUESTIONING CLINTON'S ETHICS.\n>> WHILE OUR COUNTRY LOST BADLY UNDER HILLARY CLINTON, SHE\nCASHED IN BIG-TIME. THERE WAS ALL THE MONEY FUNNELED\nINTO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION FROM FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND\nCORPORATIONS. IT WAS PAY FOR PLAY.\nIN A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, THE STATE DEPARTMENT WILL WORK FOR\nTHE COUNTRY, NOT FOR HILLARY CLINTON'S DONORS.\n>> IT'S NOT JUST THE CANDIDATE. THE NEW CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN COMES FROM A CONSERVATIVE WEBSITE WHICH HAS\nLONG ACCUSED THE CLINTONS OF CORRUPTION.\n>> A NEW REPORT TODAY CLAIMS THE CLINTON FOUNDATION GIVES ABOUT\n10% OF ITS MONEY THAT IT RAISES TO ACTUAL CHARITIES.\n>> ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY HAVE FLOWED TO THE CLINTONS FROM\nFOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, FOREIGN FINANCIERS AND BUSINESSES.\n>> NOW, THIS CHANGE, IF SHE BECOMES PRESIDENT, AND THERE ARE\nALREADY PEOPLE SEEING LOOPHOLES IN THE CHANGE, BUT -- SURPRISE,\nYEAH -- WE WON'T TAKE FOREIGN MONEY, WON'T TAKE CORPORATION\nMONEY. BILL CLINTON WON'T GIVE PAID\nSPEECHES. HE IS NOT GIVING ANY RIGHT NOW.\nCO THE BOSTON GLOBE SAID A WEEK AGO\nSHE SHOULD SHUT IT DOWN THEY SAY WHY DIDN'T IT POSE A PROBLEM AS\nSECRETARY OF STATE. THE ANSWER IS IT DID AND DOES\nAND THEY KNOW IT. >> THE CLINTONS WILL GET AWAY\nWITH WHATEVER THEY CAN FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.\nIT VIOLATE THE SPIRIT OF ETHICAL AGREEMENTS OR LAWS.\nTHIS IS HOW THEY DO BUSINESS. TRUMP AND SHE ARE FIGHTING ON\nEQUALLY UNLIKABLE UNPOPULAR GROUNDS HERE.\nTHIS IS ANOTHER THING WHERE, HAD SHE DONE IT SIX MONTHS AGO, THE\nSTORY WOULD BE DIFFERENT NOW. HE IS WILLING TO BE EXTREMELY\nFRANK ABOUT HER BEHAVIOR. THAT WILL BE A WEAKNESS FOR HER.\n>> THIS WILL BE AN INTERESTING DEBATE.\nWHETHER TRUMP CAN CARRY THIS IN THE DEBATE OR WHETHER SHE TURNS\nTHE TRUMP INDUSTRIES AND FINANCES --\n>> HE HAS A CLEANER ARGUMENT NOW THAT MANAFORT IS NO LONGER WITH\nTHE CAMPAIGN. HE WAS A BIT OF A LIABILITY\nBECAUSE OF HIS OVERSEAS DEALINGS AS WELL.\nI THINK THIS IS A POWERFUL ARGUMENT THAT THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN -- THAT TRUMP HIMSELF CAN MAKE.\nIT'S SORT OF -- EITHER REAL CORRUPTION OR THE SPECTER OF\nCORRUPTION. A WHIFF OF PAY FOR PLAY.\n>> CAN YOU EXPECT THIS WOMAN TO CHANGE WASHINGTON.\n>> WE DID AN ANALYSIS OVER THE WEEKEND THAT FOUND HALF OF THE\nMONEY WOULD HAVE FALLEN UNDER THE RULES THAT ARE NOW BANNED\nFOR DONATION. IT'S A REAL THING FOR THEM THAT\nGOING BACK TO HER STATE DEPARTMENT YEARS, SHE WAS -- HER\nFAMILY FOUNDATION WAS ACCEPTING MONEY FROM FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS\nAND ENTITIES IN WAYS THAT THEY ARE ACKNOWLEDGING IS BASICALLY\nUNETHICAL -- OR WOULD BE UNETHICAL COME NOVEMBER.\n>> THEIR BIG GATHERING IS THIS FALL.\nSO IT WILL COME UP AGAIN. >> THE FACT THAT SHE WAS DOING\nTHIS WHILE SECRETARY OF STATE, TAKING I MEAN BIG MONEY FROM THE\nSAUDIS, FOR EXAMPLE. WHERE ARE THE ADS?\nIT'S ONE MORE EXAMPLE OF JUST -- IF YOU HAD A FUNCTIONAL\nOPPOSITION, CAN YOU IMAGINE THE KIND OF ATTACKS THAT COULD BE\nLAUNCHED? NOW AT ALMOST LABOR DAY TO SAY,\nIF SHE IS PRESIDENT WE'LL SHUT IT DOWN.\nIT'S SUCH EASY FODDER. ONE FAST POINT.\nTHIS IS PART OF HER CHALLENGE WITH YOUNGER VOTERS.\nTHIS IS PART OF THE REASON WHY SHE WAS VULNERABLE AGAINST\nBERNIE. NOT BECAUSE OF IDEALOGICAL\nISSUES BUT THE SPECTER AND UNSEEMLINESS OF SOME OF THEIR\nFINANCIAL DEALINGS. IT SEEMS SO CYNICAL.\nTHIS IS PART OF HER CHALLENGE. TRUMP HAS BEEN A GIFT, BUT THIS\nIS PART OF HER CHALLENGE, WINNING OVER YOUNGER, MORE\nIDEALISTIC VOTERS. >> YOU HAVE JUDICIAL WATCH ABOUT\nTRYING TO GET THE E-MAILS OUT. IT FILES A LOT OF SUITS TO GET\nGOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS. IF YOU ARE A FAN OF\nTRANSPARENCY, YOU SHOULD SUPPORT THAT ASPECT.\nA JUDGE HAS SAID THEY WANT TO DEPOSE HER.\nTHE JUDGE SAID NO. YOU DON'T GET A DEPOSITION IN\nPERSON BUT SHE'LL ANSWER WRITTEN QUESTIONS.\nWE SAW REPORTS THIS WEEK THAT IN HER FBI INTERVIEW SHE SAID, I\nHAD THE PERSONAL E-MAIL ACCOUNT BECAUSE COLIN POWELL TOLD ME\nTHAT'S THE WAY TO DO THINGS. IS THERE A POSSIBILITY -- SHE\nAND HER LAWYERS WILL ANSWER THE QUESTIONS FROM JUDICIAL WATCH.\nI ASSUME THEY'LL BE EXTRA CAREFUL BUT IT STILL RAISES THE\nPER POSSIBILITY THAT WE'RE NOT DONE\nHERE. >> MOST PEOPLE IN THE POLLS\nTHINK SOMETHING UNETHICAL HAPPENED.\nBUT THEY ALSO SUGGEST PEOPLE ARE SICK OF HEARING ABOUT HER\nE-MAILS. THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS VOTING\nON THE LATTER, THEY HAVE TO BE WORRIED ABOUT THE DRIP, DRIP,\nDRIP OF THIS AND IF THEY CAN ESSENTIALLY START TO LOSE THIS\nTHING SORT OF A DEATH BY A THOUSAND CUTS.\n>> EVEN WHILE VOTERS ARE MAYBE SICK OF THE SORT OF ATMOSPHERE\nOF TALKING ABOUT THESE E-MAILS AND THE CONTROVERSY, EVERY TIME\nTHAT SOMETHING COMES OUT THAT'S CONCRETE LIKE THESE MOST RECENT\nE-MAILS THAT REVEALED THINGS ABOUT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION OR\nWHATEVER WE MAY HEAR FROM HER FBI INTERVIEWS OR FROM THE\nDEPOSITIONS TO COME, IT GIVES MORE CONCRETE FODDER FOR VOTERS\nTO LATCH ONTO. SO THEY CAN SAY IT'S NOT JUST\nTHAT THEY FEEL SHE IS UNTRUSTWORTHY BUT THEY CAN POINT\nTO SOMETHING. THEY'RE DEALING WITH THE DRIP,\nDRIP, DRIP OF REAL THINGS. >> JIM COMEY VALIDATING IT WITH\nHIS SEARING STATEMENT. >> WE'LL SEE IF TRUMP CAN GET IN\nPOSITION CLOSE ENOUGH TO MAKE",

NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO ANSWER\nTHAT. AT THE SAME TIME, YOU WILL NOTE\nTHAT THE CLINTON GLOBAL HEALTH INITIATIVE PART OF THE\nFOUNDATION HAS NOT AGREED TO THIS SO, YES, ONE PART OF THEIR\nFOUNDATION SAID THEY WILL NOT TAKE FOREIGN DONATIONS BUT\nANOTHER HUGE PART WILL NOT ACTUALLY COMMIT TO THAT AND IT\nIS A BUNDLE OF MESS FOR HILLARY CLINTON AND THEY ARE ENJOYING\nTHE FACT THAT THE MEDIA IS STILL CONCENTRATING ON PAUL MANAFORT'S\nRESIGNATION AND STEVE BANNON AND THE EASY STORES RATHER THAN LOOK\nAT THE HARD STUFF AND THE NUMBER >> A \"BOSTON GLOBE\" \"SHUT IT\nDOWN,\" IN SHE WINS HUFFINGTON POST SAID JUST SHUT IT DOWN.\n>> IT IS VERY HARD GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION\nWAS BUILT UP AROUND BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON AND CHELSEA AND\nTHEIR GLOBAL RESOLUTION TEETH AND THAT WAS REALLY WHAT MADE\nTHIS FOUNDATION WORK. IT IS VERY HARD IN, WHEN SHE\nBECOMES PRESIDENT, TO EFFECT IVELY PUT UP THE WORLD\nTHEY NEED. I AGREE WITH THE ASSESSMENT.\nTO WHAT SARAH IS SAYING, THERE IS A LOST DIGGING WE HAVE PUBLIC\nRECORDS SO WE CAN HAVE TRANSPARENCY, WITH TRUMP, HE HAS\nIN RECORD OF PUBLIC SERVICE SO WE HAVE VERY LITTLE INSIGHT INTO\nHIS BUSINESS DEALINGS BECAUSE HE WILL NOT RELEASE THE TAX\nRETURNS.

CLINTON HAVE A CHANCE TO CLARIFY\nTHIS BEFORE THE ELECTION? >> I THINK SHE'S GOING TO FULLY\nCOOPERATE AND SHE'S PLEASED IT COULD BE DONE BY QUESTIONING\nRATHER THAN LIVE QUESTIONING. SO THIS HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE.\nMR. COMEY HAS ALREADY MADE HIS FINDINGS THAT THERE'S NO\nCRIMINAL INVOLVEMENT HERE. THREE FORMER SECRETARIES OF\nSTATE USED PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVERS.\n>> THEY DID NOT USE PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVERS.\nTHERE'S QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER THEY USE PRIVATE E-MAIL ACCOUNTS\nLIKE GMAIL OR SOMETHING ELSE BUT THEY DID SO ONLY SECURE PURPOSES\nBUT NEVER WITH THEIR OWN SERVERS.\n>> WELL, IT IS. BUT THEY ALSO INDICATE THAT\nTHERE'S SUPPOSEDLY SENSITIVE INFORMATION BY FORMER\nSECRETARIES OF STATE THAT WERE USED IN THAT CONTEXT.\nSO THIS IS NOT UNIQUE. AND QUITE FRANKLY, SENATOR\nCORKER AND I WANT TO LOOK AT THIS AFTER THE ELECTION TO SEE\nTHE BEST WAY WE CAN USE ELECTRONIC TRANSFER OF\nINFORMATION BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT.\nTHIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO DEAL WITH.\nBUT AS FAR AS WHAT'S BEING DONE NOW, LOOK, THIS LAWSUIT IS BEING\nDONE BY A GROUP THAT SINCE THE 1990s HAS BEEN A RIGHT WING\nPARTISAN GROUP ATTACKING HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHIS IS A PARTISAN ATTACK. AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT'S USED\nTO TRY TO DISTRACT FROM THE IMPORTANT ISSUES OF THIS\nCAMPAIGN, THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY\nCLINTON. >> AND THEY HAVE, JUDICIAL\nWATCH, MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THEY ARE VERY DOGGED ABOUT GOING\nAFTER THESE E-MAILS. IN THE MEANTIME, THE GOP LEADERS\nOF THE HOUSE JUDICIARY AND OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES ARE PUSHING\nFOR A PERJURY INVESTIGATION TAKING DIRECTOR COMEY'S -- HIS\nOWN STATEMENTS AND PUTTING THEM UP AGAINST MRS. CLINTON'S\nSTATEMENTS SAYING THERE ARE SOME DISCREPANCIES THERE.\nTHEY'VE ASKED THE U.S. ATTORNEY THERE IN WASHINGTON TO TAKE A\nLOOK AT THAT. DO YOU THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\nCAN BE CONVINCED THERE WILL BE AN OPEN AND TRANSPARENT\nPOTENTIAL INVESTIGATION INTO THAT ISSUE?\n>> LOOK, I THINK WHAT IS BEING REQUESTED BY MY CONGRESSIONAL\nCOLLEAGUES IS STRICTLY A PARTISAN WITCH HUNT.\nI WISH THEY SHOWED THE SAME DEGREE OF INTEREST IN PAUL\nMANAFORT'S CONNECTIONS TO RUSSIA AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN REGARDS\nTO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND THE BUSINESS DEALS THAT DONALD TRUMP\nHAS HAD IN RUSSIA. IT WOULD BE NICE TO SEE THAT\nTHEY HAD SOME INTEREST AS TO WHAT RUSSIA'S INVOLVEMENT IS IN\nOUR CAMPAIGN, BUT INSTEAD THEY CONTINUE TO GO AFTER THE E-MAIL\nISSUE EVEN THOUGH, AS I SAID, FBI DIRECTOR COMEY HAS INDICATED\nTHAT THAT CASE IS CLOSED. >> HE HAS.\nTHERE WILL BE NO CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.\nHE DID RAISE A NUMBER OF CONCERNS THERE ABOUT EXTREME\nCARELESSNESS AND THE HANDLING OF CLASSIFIED MATERIAL.\nIN THE MEANTIME, WE HAD THIS POLL FROM ABC NEWS, \"WASHINGTON\nPOST,\" ABOUT WHETHER MRS. CLINTON IS HONEST AND\nTRUSTWORTHY. 38% BELIEVE SHE IS, 5 DT 9% SAY\nSHE'S NOT. >> I DON'T KNOW.\nSHE'S QUALIFIED AND SHE'S READY. AS COMPARED TO DONALD TRUMP WHO\nHAS SHOWN HIS RECKLESSNESS AND DANGEROUS STATEMENTS THAT HE'S\nMADE. HIS TEMPERAMENT TO BE COMMANDER\nIN CHIEF, HIS QUALIFICATIONS, NO, IT'S NOT THIS.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS\nBEEN ABUZZ BY SPECIAL INTEREST. AND THE CLINTON FOUNDATION WILL\nNO LONGER ACCEPT FOREIGN MONEY. THE BOSTON GLOBE SAID IT SHOW BE\nSHUT DOWN ALTOGETHER. IT CREATES A VIEW OF POTENTIAL\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST. THE INHERENT CONFLICT OF\nINTEREST IS OBVIOUS WHEN HILLARY CLINTON BECAME SECRETARY OF\nSTATE IN 2009. SHE PROMISED TO MAINTAIN A\nSEPARATION BETWEEN HER OFFICIAL WORK AND THE FOUNDATION BUT\nRECENTLY RELEASED E-MAILS BY HER STAFFERS DURING HER STATE\nDEPARTMENT TENURE MAKE CLEAR THAT THE SUPPOSED PARTITION WAS\nFAR FROM IMPREGNABLE. IF THE FOUNDATION DONORS ARE\nMOTIVATED BY ALTRUISM AND NOT BY THE LURE OF ACCESS TO THE\nCLINTONS, THEN SURELY THEY CAN FIND OTHER WAYS TO SUPPORT THE\nFOUNDATION'S GOALS. >> THE CLINTON FOUNDATION HAS\nHELPED OVER 10 MILLION HIV/AIDS ALONE, SAVED COUNTLESS LIVES.\nITS WORK IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO GLOBAL HEALTH.\nSO THEY'VE DONE SOME REALLY GREAT THINGS.\nNOW, WITH HILLARY CLINTON BEING ELECTED PRESIDENT, WHICH WE HOPE\nIT WILL BE, THEY CLEARLY NEED TO CHANGE THE WAY THEY DO BUSINESS.\nAND THEY'VE INDICATED THEY WILL. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO ACCEPT ANY\nDONATIONS FROM FOREIGN ENTITIES. THEY'RE GOING TO CHANGE THE WAY\nTHAT THE CLINTONS THEMSELVES INTERACT WITH THE FOUNDATION.\nTHOSE DECISIONS WILL BE MADE APPROPRIATE TO HILLARY CLINTON\nAS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\n>> AND WE WILL WATCH. BY THE WAY, YOU MENTION THE\nHEALTH BENEFITS AND THINGS THEY'VE WORKED ON.\nTHE CLINTON HEALTH ACCESS INITIATIVE APPARENTLY IS A PART\nOF THE FOUNDATION BUT SAYING IT'S NOT YET MADE ITS OWN\nDECISION ABOUT WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO, THAT AND ITS DONATIONS\nMAY CONTINUE AS WELL. THIS WEEK HE MADE SOME APPEALS\nTO THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY.\nI WANT TO PLAY WHAT HE SAID TUESDAY IN WISCONSIN.\n>> THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY HAS BEEN TAKEN FOR\nGRANTED FOR DECADES BY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.\nWE REJECT THE BIGOTRY OF HILLARY CLINTON, WHICH PANDERS TO AND\nTALKS DOWN TO COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND SEES THEM ONLY AS\nVOTES. >> HE TALKED ABOUT CRIME RATES\nIN MINORITY NEIGHBORHOODS, FAILING EDUCATION, HIGH\nUNEMPLOYMENT. DOES HE HAVE A POINT?\n>> NO. THERE'S A CLEAR DIFFERENCE\nBETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON ON THEIR ECONOMIC\nMETHODS WHICH IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO THE\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN MINORITY COMMUNITIES AND THAT IS HILLARY\nCLINTON'S PROGRAM WILL HELP ALL. SHE WANTS TO INVEST IN BUILDING\nOUR INFRASTRUCTURE, BUILD OUR ROADS, BUILD OUR ENERGY\nINFRAINSTRUCT. SHE WANTS TO INVEST IN PEOPLE\nTHAT FREE HIGHER EDUCATION SO ALL OF US CAN GROW.\nSHEN A RESPONSIBLE WAY BY ASKING THOSE WHO ARE\nTAKING JOBS AWAY FROM AMERICA TO PAY AN EXIT FEE AS WELL AS\nCLOSING LOOPHOLES. DONALD TRUMP IS WIDENING\nLOOPHOLES FOR THE WEALTHIEST IN THE NATION.\nTHERE'S NO COMPARISON AS TO WHICH CANDIDATE SPEAKS TO THE\nNEEDS OF THE MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES.\n>> WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THEIR ECONOMIC PLAN COMING\nUP. BUT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT\nFOREIGN POLICY. YOU'RE THE RANKING MEMBER ON THE\nSENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE.\nYOU WERE VOCALLY AND PUBLICLY OPPOSED TO THE IRAN DEAL.\nYOU FELT THERE WERE FLAWS THERE THAT YOU COULDN'T SUPPORT.\nTHERE IS NEW FALLOUT ABOUT THAT $400 MILLION PAYMENT THAT WAS\nCONVERTED INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY, GIVEN TO THE IRANIANS.\nTHIS WEEK THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS ADMITTING THAT THERE WAS SOME\nDIRECT CONNECTION WITH THE RELEASE OF AMERICANS BEING HELD\nIN IRAN ABOUT THAT. I WANT TO PLAY WHAT PRESIDENT\nOBAMA SAID AUGUST 4th AND THEN WHAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS\nSAYING THIS WEEK. >> WE DO NOT PAY RANSOM.\nWE DIDN'T HERE AND WE WON'T IN THE FUTURE PRECISELY BECAUSE IF\nWE DID, THEN WE WOULD START ENCOURAGING AMERICANS TO BE\nTARGETED. >> IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FOOLISH\nAND PRUDENT, IRRESPONSIBLE FOR ITS TO NOT MAINTAIN MAXIMUM\nLEVERAGE. SO IF YOU'RE ASKING ME WAS THERE\nA CONNECTION IN THAT REGARD AT THE ENDGAME, I'M NOT GOING TO\nDENY THAT. >> TO A LOT OF PEOPLE IT SOUNDS\nLIKE A RANSOM PAYMENT. BUT WAS IT?\n>> THIS WAS DONE AND ANNOUNCED IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR.\nSECRETARY CLINTON WAS NO LONGER SECRETARY OF STATE.\nTHIS IS UNDER SECRETARY KERRY. CLEARLY WHAT WAS DONE HERE IS WE\nPAID MONEY THAT WE OWED. WE HAD TO PAY THIS MONEY, IT WAS\nCLEAR. TO THE EXTENT THAT IT HAD\nANYTHING TO DO WITH HOSTAGES, SECRETARY KERRY MADE IT CLEAR\nTHAT THAT MONEY WOULD NOT BE RELEASED UNLESS OUR HOSTAGES\nWERE BACK HOME. NO, IT'S NOT PAYING RANSOM.\nWE WON'T DO THAT. WE UNDERSTAND WE OWED THE MONEY\nAND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY THE MONEY, BUT WE WANT TO MAKE\nSURE THAT OUR PEOPLE ARE PROTECTED.\n>> A TOP IRANIAN GENERAL SAID THIS MONEY WAS RETURNED FOR THE\nFREEDOM OF THE U.S. SPIES AND IT WAS NOT RELATED TO THE NUCLEAR\nNEGOTIATIONS. SO IF THERE'S A PERCEPTION HERE,\nREGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANYONE WANTS TO USE THE WORD \"RANSOM\"\nOR NOT, THAT THERE'S LEVERAGE IN RELEASING THE AMERICANS AND\nGETTING THE EXCHANGE, ISN'T IT A PROBLEM BECAUSE WE'VE HAD TWO\nMORE AMERICANS TAKEN BY IRANIAN AUTHORITIES SINCE THIS PAYMENT.\n>> WHATEVER THE IRANIANS SAY, YOU CAN BELIEVE JUST ABOUT\nOPPOSITE. THEY RARELY TELL US WHAT IS\nGOING ON. AMERICA HAS A VERY STRONG\nPOLICY. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS\nCARRIED OUT THAT POLICY. NO, WE WILL NOT PAY RANSOM\nBECAUSE THAT ONLY ENCOURAGES MORE TO BE TAKEN.\nSO I AGREE WITH THAT POINT. WE ARE NOT GOING TO PAY RANSOM.\nHERE WE HAD TO MAKE THIS PAYMENT.\nIT WAS A MATTER OF WHEN WE WERE GOING TO MAKE IT.\nIT WAS BEING LITIGATED IN INTERNATIONAL COURTS, MONEY THAT\nAMERICA OWED THAT PREDATES THIS IRANIAN ADMINISTRATION.\nIT WAS GOING TO HAVE TO BE PAID AND THE ADMINISTRATION MADE\nJUDGMENTS AS TO WHEN TO PAY IT. >> YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE\nPERCEPTION CAN CAUSE A PROBLEM. >> I UNDERSTAND PERCEPTION, BUT\nI UNDERSTAND IN THAT WAS WELL UNDERSTOOD AT THE TIME IN\nJANUARY. HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HILLARY\nCLINTON. SHE WAS NOT SECRETARY OF STATE\nAT THE TIME. >> NOT ASKING IN THAT CONTEXT,\nBUT JUST ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION.\nI WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT SYRIA BECAUSE THE PICTURES THE AND\nIMAGES OF THE LITTLE BOY, THE 5-YEAR-OLD BEING TAKEN OUT OF\nTHE RUBBLE AFTER THIS AIR STRIKE HIT HIS FAMILY.\nWE FOUND OUT HIS 10-YEAR-OLD BROTHER WOUND UP DIEING FROM\nTHAT AIR STRIKE. THIS CAME AFTER PRESIDENT OBAMA\nSAID IT IS TIME FOR BASHAR AL SAD STEP ASIDE.\nFIVE YEARS LATER WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS, BY ALL\nACCOUNTS, WHO ARE DEAD, WHY IS THIS EVEN WORSE THAN BEFORE, THE\nCHAOS IN SYRIA? >> PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT\nRUSSIA IS HELPING THE SYRIAN REGIME.\nTHE SYRIAN REGIME HAS COMMITTED APROSTIES.\nWE SEE THAT IN ALEPPO AND OTHER PARTS OF SYRIA.\nTHEN WE HAVE, OF COURSE, THE ISIL FORCES THAT ARE ALSO\nCAUSING THESE PROBLEMS. >> WHAT COULD WE HAVE BEEN DOING\nBETTER? >> WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS WORK\nWITH OUR INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS. THAT'S WHAT THE OBAMA\nADMINISTRATION HAS DONE. WE CAN'T POLICE THE WORLD.\nIF WE PUT OUR TROOPS THERE IT WILL BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.\nWE KNOW THAT. WE HAVE TO BUILD UP LOCAL\nCAPACITY. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE OBAMA\nADMINISTRATION HAS DONE. WE'RE REGAINING TERRITORY AT THE\nSAME TIME BUILDING THE LOCAL CAPACITY TO HOLD THAT TERRITORY.\nAND THAT WE HAVE DONE. WE HAVE TO CONTINUOUSLY DO THAT\nUNTIL THERE IS NO LONGER AN ISIS AND THE CALIPHATE IS OVER.\n>> WE ALL LOOK FORWARD TO THAT DAY.\nSENATOR BEN CARDIN, THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK.\nGOOD TO HAVE YOU ON FOX NEWS",

SHE SAID THAT'S STILL TO BE\nDETERMINED. AS FOR THE DEMOCRATS, CLINTON\nMAY BE AHEAD IN ALMOST EVERY POLL, BUT SHE HAS COME UNDER\nRENEWED SCRUTINY ABOUT HER E-MAIL AND HER FAMILY'S\nFOUNDATION. THIS MORNING, HER CAMPAIGN\nMANAGER SAID BILL CLINTON'S PLEDGE TO STOP ACCEPTING\nDONATIONS IF HIS WIFE IS ELECTED SHOULD GO A LONG WAY TO ENSURE\nTHERE IS NO CONFLICT OF INTEREST.\nHE ALSO POINTED FINGERS AT THE BUSH FOUNDATION.\nLISTEN TO THIS. >> THE STEPS THAT THEY'VE PLEDGED TO TAKE, YOU DIDN'T HEAR\nQUESTIONS ABOUT THE BUSH FOUNDATION WHEN THE SECOND BUSH\nPRESIDENT CAME INTO THE OFFICE.

WHAT SHOULD THE PRESS DO HERE ON\nTHESE HEALTH-RELATED QUESTIONS? >> I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY\nIRRESPONSIBLE FOR OUTLETS TO BE PUSHING THIS WHEN THERE'S\nABSOLUTELY NO PROOF THAT THERE'S ANY ISSUE HERE.\nSHE'S ACTUALLY RELEASED MORE DOCUMENTATION ON HER MEDICAL\nSTATUS THAN DONALD TRUMP HAS. THE PICTURES ARE TAKEN OUT OF\nCONTEXT, AS YOU POINTED OUT. THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER VIDEO\nTHAT'S GOING AROUND THAT'S ALSO BEEN TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT.\nTHERE'S JUST NO THERE THERE. AND YOU KNOW, HOWARD, I'M NO\nHILLARY CLINTON LOVER, I WILL SUPPORT HER IN THIS ELECTION.\nI THINK THERE ARE LEGITIMATE ISSUES TO BE PUSHING HER ON\nINCLUDING THE CLINTON FOUNDATION STUFF, BUT THIS JUST DOESN'T\nMAKE ANY SENSE. THERE'S NOTHING TO IT.\nAND I THINK IT'S DISGUSTING THAT OUTLETS WOULD MISLEAD THEIR\nVIEWERS IN IMPLYING THAT THERE'S ANYTHING REALLY GOING ON HERE.\n>> WELL, I THINK BOTH CANDIDATES SHOULD RELEASE MEDICAL RECORDS\nAND HOPEFULLY THAT WILL BE HAPPENING.\nYOU MENTIONED THIS VIDEO, SO LET ME COME TO YOU, CHRISTINA, WITH\nTHIS ONE, TWO-MONTH-OLD VIDEO HILLARY CLINTON ATTEMPTEDING TO\nINTERVIEWED, WOW, DID HILLARY CLINTON JUST SUFFER A SEIZURE ON\nCAMERA.

IT SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT WHAT\nEACH OF THESE CANDIDATES WOULD DO FOR THE COUNTRY BECAUSE YOU\nNEVER KNOW WHETHER SOMEBODY IS MENTALLY CAPABLE OR PHYSICALLY\nCAPABLE REALLY UNTIL THEY'RE DOING THE JOB.\n>> RIGHT. A LOT OF THESE TV DOCTORS GIVING\nTHEIR OPINION. I MEAN, THEY'VE NEVER EXAMINED\nHER. IT'S ALL DONE FROM AFAR.\nLET'S TALK ABOUT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nWHICH NOW ANNOUNCED THAT IF INDEED HILLARY CLINTON WINS THE\nPRESIDENCY, THE FOUNDATION, THE FAMILY FOUNDATION, WILL NO\nLONGER ACCEPT CORPORATE CONTRIBUTIONS OR CONTRIBUTIONS\nFROM FOREIGN DONORS, WHICH MAKES UP ABOUT HALF OF IT.\nSO, SARAH, THAT RAISES THE OBVIOUS QUESTION, WELL, THAT'S\nTHE STANDARD NOW, WHAT ABOUT WHEN HILLARY CLINTON WAS\nSECRETARY OF STATE? >> IT'S INCREDIBLE.\nREPORTERS ENJOY TALKING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE IT'S EASY,\nA SUGAR HIGH. BUT THIS IS WHERE THE MEAT IS\nAND YOU HAVE TO DIG INTO IT A LITTLE.\nABSOLUTELY WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD IT NOT BE OKAY FOR THEM TO\nTAKE FOREIGN DONATIONS WHEN SHE'S PRESIDENT, BUT IT WAS OKAY\nWHEN SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE? AND NO ONE'S BEEN ABLE TO ANSWER\nTHAT. AT THE SAME TIME YOU'LL NOTE\nTHAT THE CLINTON HEALTH GLOBAL HEALTH INITIATIVE ACTUALLY\nHASN'T AGREED TO THIS. SO THIS ONE PART OF THEIR\nFOUNDATION SAID WON'T TAKE FOREIGN DONATIONS, BUT ANOTHER\nHUGE PART ACTUALLY WON'T COMMIT TO THAT.\nSO IT'S A BUNDLE OF MESS FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nAND THEY ARE JUST ENJOYING THE FACT THAT THE MEDIA FOR THE MOST\nPART IS STILL CONCENTRATING ON PAUL MANAFORT'S RESIGNATION AND\nKELLYANNE CONWAY, STEVE BANNON AND THESE VERY EASY STORIES\nINSTEAD OF DIGGING INTO THE HARD STUFF WHERE YOU GOT TO LOOK AT\nTHE NUMBERS. >> RIGHT.\n>> KRYSTAL, BOSTON GLOBE, SHUT IT DOWN IF SHE WINS.\n\"THE HUFFINGTON POST\" SAYS JUST SHUT IT DOWN.\nNOT A LOT OF DEFENSE IN PARTICULAR WHERE CLINTON TAKING\nFOREIGN MONEY. >> I THINK IT'S VERY HARD GIVEN\nTHAT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION WAS BUILT UP AROUND BILL AND HILLARY\nAND CHELSEA AND THEIR GLOBAL PRESTIGE AND THAT WAS REALLY\nWHAT MADE THIS FOUNDATION WORK. I THINK IT'S VERY HARD IF WHEN\nSHE BECOMES PRESIDENT TO REALLY EFFECTIVELY PUT UP THE WALL THEY\nWOULD NEED TO. I AGREE WITH THAT ASSESSMENT.\n>> ALL RIGHT. >> TO WHAT SARAH'S SAYING HERE,\nI THINK THAT THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF DIGGING INTO THE MEAT OF\nTHIS ISSUE. UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAVE PUBLIC\nRECORDS HERE SO THAT WE CAN HAVE SOME TRANSPARENCY.\nWITH DONALD TRUMP ON THE OTHER HAND, HE HAS NO RECORD OF PUBLIC\nSERVICE AND WE HAVE VERY LITTLE INSIGHT INTO HIS BUSINESS\nDEALINGS SINCE HE WON'T RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS.\nSO IT'S VERY HARD TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH HIM.\n>> LET ME JUMP IN.

THERE WAS THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT\nTHE CLINTON FOUNDATION ITSELF WILL STOP ACCEPTING FOREIGN AND\nCORPORATE DONATIONS IF SHE IS ELECTED PRESIDENT.\nBUT THERE ARE DIFFERENT PORTIONS OF THE CLINTON CHARITY FAMILY\nWHO ARE EITHER SAYING THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT OR THEY\nHAVEN'T DECIDED.

NOT YET.\nI JUST FELT LIKE HE WASN'T TELLING ME THE TRUTH ALL THE\nWAY. I WAS REALLY AFRAID BECAUSE HE\nWAS ALWAYS WITH ME. >> AFRAID, YET THEY CONTINUED TO\nSEE EACH OTHER, SLEEP TOGETHER, AND PARTY TOGETHER.\nABOUT TWO WEEKS AFTER ERIC CHANGED HIS STORY, HE AND TINA\nWENT TO A CLUB AND TOOK THE DRUG ECSTASY.\n>> WE GET HOME, WE WALK INSIDE THE HOUSE AND WE'RE BOTH LAYING\nON THE BED STARING STRAIGHT UP AT THE CEILING TOGETHER.\nALL OF A SUDDEN AS WE WERE TALKING, IT JUST CAME TO ME AND\nI SAID TO HIM, I SAID OH, MY GOD, YOU HIT HER OVER THE HEAD.\nAND HE GOES, HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?\n>> THE FACT IS, SHE HADN'T KNOWN.\nCALL IT INTUITION OR THE EFFECTS OF THE DRUG OR A RANDOM GUESS.\nBUT IT WAS AN OPENING AND TINA BARRELED THROUGH.\n>> I SAID YOU NEED TO TELL ME THE TRUTH.\nHE'S CALMLY TALKING TO ME AND HE SAYS, I'M GOING TO TELL YOU THE\nTRUTH. HE GOES, WE HAD THIS HUGE PARTY,\nSO EVERYBODY COULD SEE HOW HAPPY WE WERE TOGETHER.\n>> ALL THEIR FRIENDS WERE THERE, WITNESSES TO THE HAPPY MARRIAGE.\nTHEN A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER, SHE SAYS, ERIC TOLD HER HE TOOK\nPEGYE OUT TO SEA ON THAT RENTED BOAT, AND ALTHOUGH PEGYE DIDN'T\nKNOW IT, HE TOOK ALONG SOME WEIGHTS.\n>> THEN HE GOES THEN I WALKED UP BEHIND HER AND HE GOES I HIT HER\nSO HARD SHE DIDN'T FEEL A THING. I SAID, WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU HIT\nHER SO HARD? HE SAID, I HIT HER OVER THE HEAD\nWITH WEIGHTS. >> SHE SAID HE TOLD HER THERE\nWAS BLOOD EVERYWHERE. THEN TINA SAYS ERIC BECHLER TOLD\nHER HOW HE GOT RID OF HIS WIFE. >> HE JUST DID HER WRISTS AND\nANKLES TOGETHER SO SHE WAS COMPLETELY BENT IN HALF.\nHE SAID HE TOOK TWO TRASH BAGS HE HAD, PUT HER BODY IN IT AND\nTHEN HE PUT THE WEIGHTS AND TIED IT DOWN TO THE ROPE AND THREW\nHER IN. >> TWO YEARS AFTER PEGYE\nVANISHED, A STUNNING CONFESSION. THEN YOU GO TO SLEEP NEXT TO A\nMAN THAT YOU BELIEVE IS A KILLER?\n>> NO, ACTUALLY THEN WE HAD SEX. I FELT LIKE I HAD TO DO IT\nBECAUSE I THINK THAT MADE HIM FEEL LIKE I WAS GOING TO BE\nQUIET AND THAT HE WAS, I DON'T KNOW, SEALING THE DEAL WITH ME\nOR SOMETHING. >> BUT THE DEAL WAS NOT SEALED.\nNOT WITH ANYONE. THE CASE WAS STILL OPEN AND\nDETECTIVES HAD BEEN KEEPING AN EYE ON ERIC AND TINA ALL ALONG.\nTHEY KNEW THE RELATIONSHIP WAS GROWING VOLATILE.\n>> WE WERE EXCITED ABOUT IT IN A MORBID KIND OF WAY BECAUSE WE\nKNEW IT WAS GOING TO GO SIDEWAYS.\n>> BECAUSE WHEN RELATIONSHIPS GO SIDEWAYS, SOMETIMES PEOPLE START\nTALKING. >> THAT'S RIGHT.\n>> AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TWO WEEKS AFTER ERIC'S APPARENT\nCONFESSION. A NEIGHBOR CALLED 911 AFTER\nHEARING YELLING COMING FROM TINA'S APARTMENT.\nWHEN POLICE ARRIVED, ERIC WAS GONE, BUT TINA WAS ANGRY.\nAND SHE STILL HAD THE BUSINESS CARD DETECTIVE MURPHY HAD GIVEN\nHER ALMOST TWO YEARS EARLIER. >> I GRABBED MY PARTNER, WE WENT\nOUT THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND WE MET UP WITH TINA.\n>> SHE TOLD DETECTIVE MURPHY AND HIS PARTNER, GARY JONES, WHAT\nERIC HAD SAID. A BIG BREAK, YES, BUT NOT NEARLY\nENOUGH FOR AN ARREST. REMEMBER, TINA WAS PRETTY FAR\nFROM AN IDEAL WITNESS. DETECTIVES KNEW THEY WOULD NEED\nMORE THAN HER WORD AGAINST ERIC'S.\nSO THEY ASKED TINA -- >> WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO WEAR\nA WIRE? I SAID, YES.\nTHAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GOING TO GET HIM.\n>> WHY WOULD YOU TURN IN A GUY WHO HAD BASICALLY TAKEN YOU FROM\nA TERRIBLE LIFE AND GIVEN YOU A GREAT LIFE?\n>> BECAUSE I COULDN'T LIVE WITH MYSELF.\nNO WAY. >> POLICE PLANTED MICROPHONES IN\nHER CAR, IN HER PURSE, AND ON HER BODY.\nAND TINA ARRANGED A MEETING. SHE TOLD ERIC THAT AFTER THE\nDOMESTIC VIOLENCE CALL, SHERIFF'S HOMICIDE DETECTIVES\nCAME IN TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT ERIC.\nTHIS DINNER DATE, TINA TOLD ERIC, WAS TO GET THEIR STORIES\nSTRAIGHT IN CASE THE COPS QUESTIONED HER AGAIN.\nTINA, WIRED UP, PICKED UP ERIC FROM HIS HOME AND DROVE TO A\nRESTAURANT CALLED EL TORITO. WERE YOU WORRIED ABOUT THIS?\n>> NOT REALLY. I WAS MORE WORRIED THAT I WASN'T\nGOING TO GET HIM TO CONFESS AGAIN.\nI HAVE TWO STORIES IN MY HEAD. I DON'T WANT TO SCREW UP AT ALL.\n>> THERE'S NO STORY TO TELL. YOU WEREN'T THERE.\nIT WAS AN ACCIDENT. >> ONCE INSIDE THE RESTAURANT,\nTINA TRIED TO GETTER RICK TO REPEAT THE DETAILS OF PEGYE'S\nDEATH. ERIC WOULDN'T GO THERE.\n>> DETAILS AREN'T IMPORTANT. >> SO TINA TRIED TO GET HIM TO\nSAY WHY HE DID IT. >> IT'S NO CONFESSION, BUT IT'S\nNOT A DENIAL EITHER. ARE YOU THINKING TO YOURSELF AT\nTHAT'S IT, I GOT HIM? >> I HONESTLY THOUGHT THAT WAS\nGOOD, BUT I STILL THOUGHT THAT WASN'T ENOUGH. >> REMEMBER, PEGYE HAD A LIFE\nINSURANCE POLICY WORTH MORE THAN $2 MILLION.\nAGAIN, SHE TRIED TO GET HIM TO GIVE HER A REASON.\n>> WHAT MADE YOU WANT TO GO -- >> SHE WAS GOING TO STEAL THE\nKIDS AWAY AND I WAS NEVER GOING TO SEE THEM AGAIN.\n>> AND ERIC REASSURED TINA. >> ALL I KNOW I WOULD NEVER,\nEVER DO ANYTHING TO HARM ANYBODY EVER AGAIN.\n>> SHE WAS GOOD. SHE WAS REALLY GOOD.\n>> BUT THE DRAMA WASN'T OVER. TINA LEFT THE RESTAURANT WITH\nERIC, STILL WIRED UP. >> THIS IS WHERE IT GETS REALLY\nSCARY. WE'RE WALKING OUT TO THE CAR AND\nHE SAYS TO ME, LET ME DRIVE. >> THAT WAS NOT PART OF THE\nPLAN. >> WE LOSE SIGHT OF THEM.\n>> IN A MOVIE, THIS IS WHERE YOU HEAR THE SOUND OF A GUNSHOT.\n>> THAT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN GOOD.\n>> IN THE CAR WITH ERIC NOW BEHIND THE WHEEL, TINA CRANKED\nUP HER ACTING SKILLS AND THE TENSION. >> NOW TINA TRIED TO GETTER RICK\nOUT OF THE CAR. >> PULL MY CAR OVER NOW.\nI DON'T TRUST YOU. I'M AFRAID OF YOU NOW.\n>> ALL I'M ASKING -- YOU DON'T HAVE TO -- NOBODY KNOWS ANYTHING\nBUT YOU. YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ANYBODY\nANYTHING. >> ERIC PULLED OTHER AND GOT\nOUT. AND TINA HOPPED IN THE DRIVER'S\nSEAT. JUST LIKE THAT, TINA NEW DROVE\nAWAY FROM HER OLD LIFE. IN THE END, YOU GOT ENOUGH.\n>> ABSOLUTELY, YEAH. >> YOU UNDERSTAND YOU'RE UNDER\nARREST? >> ERIC WAS ARRESTED AND CHARGED\nWITH PEGYE'S MURDER. WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO GET THE CALL\nTHAT ERIC HAD BEEN ARRESTED? >> WELL, I JUST TREMBLED ALL\nOVER. I COULDN'T REALLY BELIEVE IT.\n>> BUT TWO WEEKS AFTER ERIC'S ARREST MADE HEADLINES, TINA MADE\nSOME HEADLINES OF HER OWN. THAT PUT THE WHOLE CASE IN\nJEOPARDY.",

THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATE IS STRUGGLING TO WIN OVER MINORITY VOTERS, INCLUDING\nHISPANICS. HE ALIENATED MANY WITH HIS\nCOMMENTS ABOUT UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS.\nTRUMP IS TRAILING HILLARY CLINTON BY 46 POINTS AMONG\nLATINO VOTERS. HE'S PUSHING HARDER FOR\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS SAYING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY MUST DO\nBETTER IN ITS OUTREACH TO THAT COMMUNITY.\nLISTEN. >> I HAVE ASKED THE\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY TO HONOR ME WITH THEIR VOTE.\nI FULLY RECOGNIZE THE OUTREACH TO THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nCOMMUNITY IS IN AN AREA WHERE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY MUST DO\nBETTER. AND IT WILL DO BETTER.\nTHE GOP IS THE PARTY OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN.\nAND I WANT OUR PARTY TO BE THE HOME OF THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nVOTER ONCE AGAIN. >> WHILE TRUMP IS TRYING TO\nAPPEAL TO AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS AND OTHER MINORITY\nGROUPS, HE IS STRUGGLING WITH THE DEMOGRAPHIC THAT REPUBLICANS\nTRADITIONALLY WIN, IT'S WHITE, COLLEGE EDUCATED VOTERS.\nJOHN KING HAS MORE ON THAT. >> MAKE SOME MAGIC.\nTHIS IS 2012. FOUR-POINT WIN NATIONALLY IN THE\nPOPULAR VOTE FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA, BUT A THUMPING OVER MITT\nROMNEY IN THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE. IF YOU ARE DONALD TRUMP, YOU\nNEED TO CHANGE BLUE STATES RED AND THE DYNAMICS OF THE\nELECTION. ONE THING YOU CANNOT DO IS\nUNDERPERFORM ROMNEY WITH KEY CONSTITUENCIES.\nONE OF THE BIG CHANGES IN THE CAMPAIGN, A REASON TRUMP IS IN A\nDITCH, IF YOU LOOK AT THIS CONSTITUENCY HERE, THIS IS\nELECTION DAY 2012. WHITE, COLLEGE GRADS, ROMNEY\nWITH A 14-POINT LEAD OVER BARACK OBAMA.\nREPUBLICANS ALWAYS WIN THE WHITE VOTE.\nHE HAD A LEAD OVER WHITE COLLEGE GRADS.\nYOU FIND A LOT IN THE KEY SUBURBS, THE SWING STATES.\nBIG EDGE FOR ROMNEY, ONE THING THAT MAKES IT INTERESTING AND\nTRUMP'S CHALLENGE GREATER, HILLARY CLINTON LEAD.\nTHIS IS THE CNN/ORC POLL. HILLARY CLINTON WILL A LEAD OVER\nWHITE COLLEGE GRADS. THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS\nHILLARY CLINTON IS WINNING IN MANY OF THE BIG SWING STATES\nBECAUSE OF THE SAME DYNAMIC. THIS IS THE STATE OF NORTH\nCAROLINA. ROMNEY WON NORTH CAROLINA IN\n2012. IT WAUZ BIG DEAL WHEN OBAMA WON\nIN 2008. ROMNEY GOT IT BACK IN 2012 BY\nWINNING 60/40, A 19-POINT LEAD IN THE COLLEGE GRADS.\nTHEY ARE BIG IN THE RALEIGH AND CHARLOTTE SUBURBS.\nVERY IMPORTANT TO WIN AND CLINTON WITH A LEAD RIGHT NOW.\nA SEVEN-POINT LEAD, ROMNEY WON BY 60/40.\nTHE DEMOCRAT HAS A LEAD NOW AMONG THE CONSTITUENCY.\nAGAIN, YOU CANNOT WIN NORTH CAROLINA IF YOU ARE GETTING\nCRUSHED IN THIS ELECTORATE. THAT WAS NORTH CAROLINA.\nA STATE HE MUST WIN. IT'S SIMILAR IN A STATE LIKE\nVIRGINIA, A STATE DONALD TRUMP MIGHT HAVE TO WIN.\nTIM KAINE, THE RUNNING MATE IS FROM THERE.\nSHE HAS LEAD IN NORTH CAROLINA. A COMFORTABLE LEAD IN COLORADO.\nWHAT DO THESE STATES HAVE IN COMMON?\nA VERY IMPORTANT CONSTITUENCY, COLLEGE EDUCATED WHITES.\nIT'S GROWING. A REPUBLICAN CONSTITUENCY IN\n2012, IT HAS BEEN A REPUBLICAN CONSTITUENCY TRADITIONALLY.\nIT'S LEADING CLINTON'S WAY RIGHT NOW.\nIF TRUMP CAN'T CHANGE THAT, HILLARY CLINTON WILL WIN THE\nELECTION. >> JOHN KING AT THE MAGIC WALL.\nTHANK YOU. DONALD TRUMP IS NOT ONLY BEHIND\nCLINTON IN THE POLLS BUT ALSO THE SEARCH FOR MONEY TO RUN HIS\nCAMPAIGN. THIS WEEKEND, HILLARY CLINTON IS\nIN MASSACHUSETTS ATTENDING PRIVATE FUND-RAISERS THERE.\nHER CAMPAIGN REPORTED SATURDAY, SHE HAS $58 MILLION IN CASH ON\nHAND TO DONALD TRUMP'S $38 MILLION.\nIN ADDITION, A TOP POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE, A SUPERPAC\nBACKING CLINTON HAS 40 M$40 MIL TO SPEND.\nTOGETHER, THEY HAVE SPENT $300 MILLION SO FAR WITH TWO AND A\nHALF MONTHS TO GO UNTIL ELECTION",

CLEARLY THE VOTERS HAVE A RIGHT\nTO KNOW WHETHER SHE'S PREPARED AND UP FOR THE CHALLENGE.\n>> HILLARY? >> OH, GOD.\nWELL, HILLARY CLINTON DOES MORE EV\nEVENTS, YOU KNOW, IN A WEEK THAN DONALD TRUMP HAS EVER DONE THIS\nENTIRE CAMPAIGN. HE DOES ONE EVENT A DAY.\nSHE DOES THREE AND FOUR EVENTS A DAY.\nTHE LAST THING VOTERS WILL EVER BELIEVE IS THAT HILLARY CLINTON\nWILL BE OUTWORKED. SHE WON'T BE OUTWORKED.\nWE OUGHT TO GO TO THE BIGGER PICTURE, THOUGH, OF THIS\nMESSAGE. YOU KNOW, I'M AMUSED IN WATCHING\nDONALD TRUMP NOW. THIS IS I THINK DAY THREE OF HIS\nCONSTANT TELEPROMPTER USE. HE DOESN'T REALLY SEEM ANY MORE\nCOMFORTABLE ON DAY THREE THAN HE DID AT THE OUTSET.\nBUT THIS IS CLEARLY AN ATTEMPT TO BE A LITTLE MORE DISCIPLINED\nAND MORE CONTROLLED. BUT IN MANY WAYS IT LOSES ALL OF\nTHE AUTHENTICITY THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS.\nSO HE GETS KIND OF THE WORST OF BOTH WORLDS.\nHE'S ON THIS TELEPROMPTER SAYING REALLY RIDICULOUS THINGS.\nSO HE'S NOT EVEN GETTING THE BENEFIT OF THEM SOUNDING\nOFF-THE-CUFF. HE'S ATTACKING HER STAMINA BUT\nIT'S ON THE TELEPROMPTER. SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT DONALD\nTRUMP WE'RE GETTING AT ANY ONE MOMENT HERE.\nBUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT THIS SORT OF DISJOINTED SPEECH IS NOT\nGOING TO BE EFFECTIVE. >> HOWEVER, HILARY ROSEN, EVEN\nAS A CLINTON SUPPORTER, DIDN'T THE MOMENT STRIKE YOU WHEN HE\nSAID, HE ADMITTED, IT WAS SORT OF THIS MOMENT OF CONTRITION, HE\nSAID WE AS A PARTY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nVOTERS, I KNOW WE HAVE TO DO BETTER.\nHE SAID, WILL AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS PLEASE HONOR ME WITH YOUR\nVOTE. >> YEAH, LOOK, I BELIEVE THAT IT\nIS A CRIME THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS SO ABANDONED PEOPLE OF\nCOLOR AND THE DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION MESSAGE.\nI DO THINK IT'S IRONIC THAT THE ENTIRE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION,\nWHICH WAS THE MOST INCLUSIVE AND DIVERSE CONVENTION WE'VE EVER\nSEEN, DONALD TRUMP MOCKED HILLARY FOR THAT VERY THING, AND\nTHEN HE GOES INTO AN AUDIENCE AND SAYS WE CARE ABOUT\nINCLUSION, WE CARE ABOUT REACHING OUT.\nI JUST DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO BE VERY CREDIBLE.\nYOU SHOULD GO ON BLACK TWITTER TODAY AND SEE HOW PEOPLE OF\nCOLOR ARE REACTING TO HIS SPEECH.\nHAVING SAID THAT, SHOULD REPUBLICANS BE MAKING POLICY\nPROPOSALS AND THINKING ABOUT HOW TO HELP PEOPLE OF COLOR?\nOF COURSE THEY SHOULD BE. AND, YOU KNOW, IT WILL REMAIN TO\nBE SEEN WHETHER THIS IS SUCCESSFUL.\nI DON'T THINK IT WILL BE. >> ANOTHER MOMENT THAT STOOD OUT\nTO ME WAS WHEN DONALD TRUMP TALKED ABOUT THE SECOND\nAMENDMENT. LET'S PLAY THIS.\n>> HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO ESSENTIALLY ABOLISH THE SECOND\nAMENDMENT FOR LAW ABIDING AMERICANS.\nSHE WANTS TO OVERTURN THE SUPREME COURT RULING THAT\nAFFIRMED THE SECOND AMENDMENT AS A PRIVATE RIGHT SO THAT ANY CITY\nOR STATE IN THIS COUNTRY CAN BAN PRIVATE GUN OWNERSHIP.\n>> ANDRE, THAT'S JUST FACTUALLY INACCURATE TO SAY.\nAND I KNOW IT PLAYS WELL WITH HIS SUPPORTERS, WE'VE HEARD THEM\nCHEER AFTERWARDS. I JUST WONDER, AS A FORMER\nLAWMAKER YOURSELF AND A TRUMP SUPPORTER, DO YOU THINK THAT\nSAYING THINGS LIKE THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN, THAT SHE WANTS TO\nABOLISH THE SECOND AMENDMENT, WHICH IS JUST NOT TRUE, IS A\nSMART LONG TERM PLAY? >> SHE SAID SHE FAVORS A BUYBACK\nPROGRAM. SHE SAID SHE FAVORS THE\nAUSTRALIAN SYSTEM. SO SHE HAS GIVEN SOME INDICATION\nTHAT SHE WOULD LIKE TO SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE THE AMOUNT\nOF GUNS IN THIS COUNTRY. >> THAT IS NOT ABOLISHING THE\nSECOND AMENDMENT THOUGH. SO SAY IT THAT WAY, RIGHT?\n>> YOU LOOK AT IT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, IF YOU'RE TRYING TO\nENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GIVE THEIR GUNS BACK, THAT'S DOING A LOT TO\nDO AWAY WITH THE SECOND AMENDMENT.\nI'M SORRY, GO AHEAD. >> COME ON, ANDRE, YOU KNOW\nTHAT'S NOT TRUE. YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST RHETORIC.\nSHE'S NOT FOR THAT. SHE'S WHERE 90% OF THE COUNTRY\nIS IN TERMS OF BACKGROUND CHECKS AND THE LIKE.\n>> THEN I DON'T RUN INTO THE OTHER 10%, THE ONLY 10% THAT\nWANT TO SELL THEIR GUNS BACK TO THE GOVERNMENT.\nAS A TAXPAYER, I DON'T WANT TO BUY THE GUNS BACK.\nI THINK LAW ABIDING CITIZENS OUGHT TO OWN A FIREARM, THEY\nOUGHT TO OWN SEVERAL. THAT KEEPS THE PEACE IN A LOT OF\nNEIGHBORHOODS. QUITE FRANKLY, TO CONTINUE, YOU\nKNOW, NOT TO SHOW UP, NOT TO HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS\nDRESSED IN LAW ENFORCEMENT UNIFORMS AT THE CONVENTION, I\nMEAN, IT SEEMS KIND OF ODD TO ME, IT'S ALMOST LIKE SHE'S RUN\nAWAY FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND SO I DON'T THINK SHE CAN ASK\nFOR THE FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE ENDORSEMENT THIS YEAR,\nWHICH IS ODD IN ITSELF. SHE'S DEFINITELY GIVEN SOME\nINDICATION THAT SHE DOESN'T WANT TO BE NEAR LAW AND ORDER.\n>> HILLARY, 30-SECOND RESPONSE, THEN WE'VE GOT TO GO.\n>> IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER TRUMP IS CONSISTENTLY LYING,\nFOUR-PINOCCHIO FACT CHECKER, WHICH HE SAYS THINGS LIKE\nHILLARY WANTS TO TAKE AWAY THE SECOND AMENDMENT.\nIT MAKES HIM LOOK BAD. IN A DEBATE SITUATION, WHEN HE\nCAN'T BACK UP THESE CHARGES WITH REAL FACTS, HE WILL BE BACK ON\nHIS HEELS. HE'S GOT TO BE IN A SITUATION\nWHERE HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\nHE SEEMS INCAPABLE OF THAT. >> ANDRE BAUER, HILARY ROSEN,\nTHANKS SO MUCH.",

AND I THINK THE DEMOCRATS HAVE\nALWAYS BEEN AMBIVALENT AND IT IS THEIR ACHILLES HEEL.\nRICHARD NIXON RAN ON LAW AND ORDER IN 1968.\nGEORGE W. BUSH RAISED THE ISSUE OF WHETHER JOHN KERRY COULD LEAD\nTHE WAR ON TERROR. IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD ISSUE FOR\nREPUBLICANS BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS ALWAYS ARGUE IN THE\nINNER CITIES LIKE MILWAUKEE OR BALTIMORE, THE POLICE ARE AS\nFAULT AS THE PEOPLE COMMITTING THE CRIMES.\nMOST AMERICANS I DON'T THINK BELIEVE THAT, AND TRUMP IS\nRAISING THAT ISSUE. >> THE CRIME FIGURES ARE WAY\nDOWN. THIS IS NOT 1968.\nTHERE HAVE BEEN MURDER INCREASES IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS IN A\nLOT OF CITIES, NO QUESTION. AS FAR AS A GENERAL BROAD\nINCREASE IN CRIME, WE HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN IT.\n>> ESPECIALLY IN A CITY LIKE NEW YORK FOR EXAMPLE, IT OCCURRED\nBECAUSE OF POLICING TACTICS THAT ARE LARGELY CONDEMNED BY\nDEMOCRATS LIKE HILLARY CLINTON. ALSO, WHAT'S GIVING HIM THE\nPOLITICAL OPENING IS THIS WAR ON POLICE SINCE FERGUSON.\nALTHOUGH THEIR STILL RELATIVELY LOW HISTORICALLY, MURDER RATES\nARE COMING UP IN THE NATION'S LARGEST CITIES.\nI THINK HE MADE A CASE HERE TO SAY THIS MOST OF ALL HURTS THE\nBLACK COMMUNITY, AND THE PROBLEM IS NOT TOO MANY POLICE, IT'S TOO\nFEW. PEOPLE NEED SAFETY IN URBAN\nNEIGHBORHOODS. >> WHAT ABOUT THIS REACHING OUT\nTO THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE? WE'VE BEEN ARGUING FOR YEARS\nTHAT REPUBLICANS SHOULD DO THIS. HE'S NOW TRYING TO DO THAT.\nBUT THE POLLS SUGGEST SO FAR HE REALLY ISN'T DOING VERY WELL\nAMONG BLACK VOTERS. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE PITCH?\n>> THE UPSIDE IS HE'S GOT NOWHERE TO GO BUT UP.\nBY SOME ESTIMATES HE'S GETTING ABOUT 1% OF THE BLACK VOTE.\nI THINK HE'S ALSO GOT A STRONG MESSAGE HERE.\nHILLARY CLINTON IS FEEDING THIS NARRATIVE THAT THIS IS TALKING\nABOUT THESE OCCASIONAL SHOOTINGS.\nDONALD TRUMP INSTEAD WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE ROOT CAUSES OF\nPOVERTY AND CRIME IN INNER CITIES.\nTALKED ABOUT THE FAILINGS OF DOMESTIC POLICIES THAT DEMOCRATS\nPROMOTE ON EDUCATION AND OTHER ISSUES, MANUFACTURING POLICIES.\nHE'S TRYING TO ACTUALLY GET TO THE ROOT CAUSES.\nI THINK THE BIGGER QUESTION, THOUGH, CAN YOU DO IT BY GIVING\nA ONE OFF SPEECH. YOU HAVE TO DO IT IN A SUSTAINED\nMANNER. YOU'VE ALSO GOT TO DO WHAT PAUL\nRYAN IS DOING, MAKING ALLIANCES WITHIN FAITH BASED COMMUNITIES,\nWITHIN MINORITY COMMUNITIES, WITHIN CITIES, GOING AND\nVISITING AND SHOWING THAT YOU'RE NOT JUST ASKING FOR A VOTE, BUT\nYOU UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEMS AND DEVOTED TO A COOPERATIVE\nRELATIONSHIP GOING FORWARD. >> NO OFFENSE TO WEST BEND,\nWISCONSIN. IF YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE THIS\nKIND OF PITCH, WHY NOT GO RIGHT THERE.\n>> EXACTLY. YOU'RE ASKING FOR THE BLACK\nVOTE, BUT YOU'RE DOING IT IN A WHITE SUBURB IN FRONT OF A WHITE\nAUDIENCE. TRUMP HAS TO GO INTO THESE\nNEIGHBORHOODS, INTRODUCE HIMSELF TO THESE FOLKS, AND ASK THEM TO\nEXPLAIN THEIR CONCERNS TO HIM. AND TELL PEOPLE WHY HIS POLICIES\nWOULD BE DIFFERENT THAN THE LIBERAL POLICIES THEY'VE BEEN\nLIVING UNDER. EFFECTIVE BLACK OUTREACH IS NOT\nJUST ABOUT STANDING IN FRONT OF AN AUDIENCE AND SAYING YOU\nSUPPORT SCHOOL CHOICE. IS TRUMP ADVERTISING ON BLACK\nRADIO STATIONS?

THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN IN THE\nCOMMUNITY ABOUT HOW HONEST HE IS AND HOW TRUE HE IS ABOUT THIS\nAPPEAL. WHETHER IT'S REAL OR IS THIS A\nFAKE APPEAL. >> SO ASHLEY, WHAT ABOUT HIS\nARGUMENT -- I THINK THIS IS HIS CORE AS I UNDERSTAND IT, WHICH\nIS THAT THE URBAN CORE IN AMERICA, THE CITIES, HAVE BEEN\nRUN BY DEMOCRATS FOR GENERATIONS, MORE THAN 50 YEARS\nAND THEY'RE STILL IN REALLY BAD SHAPE.\nAND SO THE FRUITS OF THE DEMOCRATS' URBAN POLICY ARE NOT\nSERVING BLACK VOTERS. DO YOU THINK THAT'S A MESSAGE\nTHAT CAN MOVE PEOPLE TO THE REPUBLICAN SIDE?\n>> ABSOLUTELY, TUCKER. HE'S RIGHT ON POINT.\nMANY TIMES WHEN YOU GO TO THESE CITIES AND YOU HAVE FAILED\nPOLICIES WHEN IT DEALS WITH EDUCATION, WHEN YOU'RE DEALING\nWITH UNEMPLOYMENT, WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH HOUSING, YOU HAVE\nVOTERS WHO NEVER VOTED FOR A REPUBLICAN, NEVER SEEN A\nREPUBLICAN. THERE'S NO REPUBLICAN TO BLAME.\nSO IF YOU NEVER VOTED FOR A REPUBLICAN AND EVERYTHING AROUND\nYOU IS CONTROLLED BY DEMOCRATS, DONALD TRUMP'S POINT IS CHANGE\nCAN ONLY -- CHANGE CAN ONLY BETTER YOUR SITUATION.\n>> RIGHT. >> WHAT SHE'S BRINGING UP IS THE\nFACT THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN ON POINT AND TALKING TO\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS AND THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANT AND WE'RE\nGETTING CRITICIZED FOR IT BUT WE'RE HAVING THAT CONVERSATION.\nDEMOCRATS ARE NOT GOING TO BACK US DOWN FOR HAVING THIS\nCONVERSATION WITH BLACK AMERICANS.\n>> WHAT SHOULD TRUMP SAY? WHAT SPECIFICALLY SHOULD HE SAY\nIN ORDER TO WIN BLACK VOTERS TO HIS CAMPAIGN?\n>> TUCKER, IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT WHAT HE SAYS.\nIT'S ABOUT WHAT HE DOES. >> I GET IT BUT --\n>> LET ME BE -- CAN I FINISH MY POINT?\nLET ME FINISH MY POINT. YOU CAN'T JUST SAY SOMETHING.\nYOU HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE YOUR WORDS.\nYOUR WORDS ONLY HAVE POWER IF THEY'RE BACKED BY YOUR ACTIONS.\n>> I AGREE. >> SO AT THE SAME TIME HE'S\nAPPEALING TO THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE, HE THEN\nPROMOTED TO THE HEAD OF HIS CAMPAIGN THE CEO OF BREITBART\nWHO HAS BEEN, YOU KNO -- HIS ONLINE REPORT WAS CALLED BY THE\nSOUTHERN POVERTY LAW GROUP A HATE WATCH REPORT.\n>> COME ON. I CAN'T LET THAT --\n>> A TRACK RECORD OF ATTACKING AFRICAN-AMERICANS.\nTHEN YOU'RE STEPPING ON YOUR OWN MESSAGE.\nHE'S STEPPING ON THE MESSAGE WHEN HE'S TRYING TO APPEAL TO US\nIF HE SURROUNDS HIMSELF BY PEOPLE THAT DON'T DEMONSTRATE\nTHAT MESSAGE. LOOK AT RUDY GIULIANI.\nRUDY IS ON TV EVERY DAY CALLING AFRICAN-AMERICANS --\n>> LET ME WEIGH IN HERE. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE DEEDS.\nSHE'S RIGHT, WHEN YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT EACH CANDIDATE\nHAS DONE AND THEIR DEEDS AND THEIR TRACK RECORD, LOOK AT THE\nCLINTON TRACK RECORD WHEN IT COMES TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS.\nNO PRESIDENCY IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY HAS INCARCERATED\nMORE PEOPLE OF COLOR THAN THE CLINTONS.\nNOBODY. WHEN YOU TRY TO LOOK AT THESE\nPOLLS RIGHT NOW, YOU HAVE THIS BOGUS POLL THAT COMES OUT SAYING\n1% OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP.\nI'LL TELL YOU A 1% POLL. THE POLL IS IF YOU ASK\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN LIE TO LAW\nENFORCEMENT AS MANY TIMES AS HILLARY CLINTON DID AND GET AWAY\nWITH IT, 99% WILL SAY THEY COULDN'T.\n>> IT WOULDN'T WORK FOR THEM. I AGREE WITH THAT.\n>> TUCKER, CAN I JUST SAY -- CAN I AGREE WITH SOMETHING ASHLEY IS\nSAYING. >> NOTHING PERSONAL, BUT WE HAVE\nA COMMERCIAL COMING UP.",

HE SAID WE'RE GOING TO BUILD\nTHAT WALL, AND THE CROWD WITH A \"USA, USA\" CHANT.\nTHERE HE IS, IN FREDERICKSBURG VIRGINIA.\nPARTWAY INTO THAT SPEECH THERE, MR. TRUMP SAID THAT HE WANTED TO\nADDRESS SOMETHING THAT'S DEEPLY PERSONAL AND OF IMPORTANCE TO\nME, I'VE ASKED THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY TO\nHONOR ME WITH THEIR VOTE. WANT TO BRING IN NOW, TO TALK\nABOUT THAT, OUR GUEST, A FORMER 2008 CLINTON CAMPAIGN ADVISER,\nFOX NEWS POLITICAL STRATEGIST AS WELL.\nAND DEANNA CALDWELL, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST, FORMER DIRECTOR OF\nAMERICAN OUTREACH FOR THE DUE PAGE COUNTY REPUBLICAN PARTY.\nGOOD TO HAVE BOTH OF YOU. I'M FIGURING THAT YOU WERE ABLE\nTO CATCH MOST OF MR. TRUMP'S SPEECH.\nJAMU, WANT TO START WITH YOU, WHAT DID YOU HEAR, WHAT STOOD\nOUT TO YOU? DID ANYTHING RESONATE?\nDID YOU BELIEVE MR. TRUMP? >> I THOUGHT EVEN AS A LIFETIME\nDEMOCRAT, I CAN SAY THAT IF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, IF THE NOMINEE\nFOR 2016 HAD FOLLOWED THE AUTOPSY AND PRESCRIPTIONS THAT\nTHE GOP LOOKED AT TO EXPAND THE PARTY, THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN\nFANTASTIC. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD FOR ALL\nAMERICANS. WHATEVER, IF YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT\nOR A REPUBLICAN. BUT INSTEAD, WHAT WE HAVE SEEN\nIN THE LAST 430-SOMETHING DAYS IS DONALD TRUMP TAPPING INTO AND\nSTOKING RACIAL ANXIETY IN THIS COUNTRY.\nAND NOW -- >> OKAY, I UNDERSTAND, WE'RE\nTIGHT ON TIME, I WANT TO GET YOUR REACTION TO MR. TRUMP'S\nSPEECH. ONE OF THE LAST THINGS HE\nADDRESSED WAS THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY.\n>> THAT'S THE THING, HE'S NOT ADDRESSING THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nCOMMUNITY -- >> THAT'S NOT TRUE.\n>> BECAUSE WHAT HE'S ACTUALLY DOING IS GOING AFTER MODERATE\nREPUBLICANS, SPECIFICALLY REPUBLICAN WOMEN WHO ARE NOT\nGOING TO BE COMFORTABLE VOTING FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS COME ACROSS\nTAPPING INTO THESE RACIAL ANXIETIES AND THEY DON'T WANT TO\nBE ALIGNED WITH ANY IDEA OF SOMEONE BEING A RACIST.\nAND SO THAT'S WHY HE'S NOT TALKING TO ROOMS OF\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS. HE'S NOT GOING INTO\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. THIS IS SPECIFICALLY TARGETED TO\nBRING BACK THOSE REPUBLICANS THAT HAVE LEFT HIM IN DROVES AND\nTHE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY SEES RIGHT THROUGH IT.\nWHEN SOMEONE TELLS YOU WHO THEY ARE, BELIEVE THEM.\n>> I'M GOING TO BRING YOU BACK BECAUSE I WANT TO TALK ON THAT\nAGAIN BUT I WANT TO BRING HIM INTO THIS DISCUSSION.\nONE OF THE THINGS MR. TRUMP SAYS IS HE WANTS THE GOP TO BE THE\nHOME OF THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTER ONCE AGAIN AND THAT HE\nWANTS A TOTALLY INCLUSIVE COUNTRY AND PARTY.\nDO YOU BELIEVE MR. TRUMP? >> I BELIEVE THAT HE DOES MEAN\nTHAT. I THINK HE'S VERY SINCERE IN\nTHAT. I THINK HE'S TAKING CORRECTIVE\nACTION. THE AUTOPSY REPORT PUT OUT BY\nTHE RNC IS AN IMPORTANT DOCUMENT IN WHICH REPUBLICANS SHOULD BE\nFOLLOWING. I THINK NOW THAT IT'S THREE\nWEEKS OUT OF THE CONVENTION, WE'RE SEEING THE ACTIONS AND THE\nRESOURCES PUT IN PLACE AT THE RNC AS WELL AS MR. TRUMP'S\nCAMPAIGN TO REALLY TACKLE THESE VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES.\nI THINK MR. TRUMP HAS DONE A GREAT JOB IN TERMS OF NOW\nGETTING OUT THERE AND MAKING ITS APPEAL TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS.\nTHE MILWAUKEE SPEECH, THE WISCONSIN SPEECH BEING ONE OF\nTHEM. THINK THE FACT HE IS APOLOGIZING\nFOR SOME OF THE STATEMENTS IN WHICH HE HAS MADE THAT'S CAUSED\nPAIN IS ALSO A HELPFUL STEP. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE MY INITIAL\nSTEP WAS MR. TRUMP, WE CAN AGRE PARTY MORE TIMES THAN NOT GO AND\nASK THE BLACK COMMUNITY FOR THEIR VOTE AND THEY GET NOTHING\nOUT OF IT. THAT'S A KNOWN FACT COMMUNITY\nWITHIN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY.\nNOW THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT -- >> COMING UP TO A HARD BREAK,\nSORRY. I'LL GET YOU BACK AFTER THE\nBREAK TO CONTINUE YOUR THOUGHT.

I'M TALKING ABOUT THE VENUES.\nAND WHAT CONCERN MUST MR. TRUMP PROVIDE CLEAR ANSWERS TO?\n>> WELL, HE CERTAINLY COULD START, ARTHEL, WITH TALKING WITH\nWHY HE QUESTIONED THE CITIZENSHIP OF THE FIRST\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT. WHY HE SUPPORTED IN HIS CAM PAIN\nTO GET THE NOMINATION. AND WHY WHEN HE WAS CAUGHT\nDISCRIMINATING AGAINST RENTING TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND SETTLED\nWITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, A FEW YEARS LATER, LOOKED AROUND\nAND THOUGHT NO ONE WAS WATCHING HIM AND SO HE THE SAME THING\nAGAIN. HE COULD START WITH THOSE\nANSWERS. IT'S VERY CLEAR I THINK TO\nANYONE LOOKING AT THIS, THIS IS NOT ABOUT AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nVOTERS. THIS IS ABOUT THE REPUBLICANS\nHE'S LOST.

HERE IS CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN\nMANAGER ROBBIE MOOK WHO SPOKE WITH CNN'S DANA BASH THIS\nMORNING. >> WHAT THE FOUNDATION DID WAS\nUNPRECEDENTED, AS I SAID, AND WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO IS\nGOING TO BE UNPRECEDENTED AS WELL.\nYOU TALK ABOUT TRANSPARENCY, DONALD TRUMP HAS RELEASED HIS\nTAXES. DONALD TRUMP HAS RELEASED A\nSERIOUS HEALTH LETTER YET. DONALD TRUMP REFUSES TO DISCLOSE\nTHE FULL ARCHITECTURE OF HIS FINANCIAL DEBTS AND OBLIGATIONS\nAROUND THE WORLD. WE JUST READ YESTERDAY IN \"THE\nNEW YORK TIMES\" THAT HE IS A DEBTOR TO THE BANK OF CHINA.\n>> ROBBY I ASKED ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON, NOT DONALD TRUMP.\nWE'RE GOING TO TALK LATER ABOUT THAT.\n>> WELL, BUT MY POINT IS THERE'S ALL THIS SCRUTINY BECAUSE\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN TRANSPARENT.\nYOU DON'T HEAR THESE QUESTIONS WHEN MEMBERS OF THE BUSH FAMILY\nCONTINUE TO SERVE ON BOARDS FOR THE FIRST PRESIDENT BUSH'S\nFOUNDATION. SO AS I SAID, THE FOUNDATION IS\nTAKING UNPRECEDENTED STEPS HERE. WE'RE VERY PROUD THAT THEY'RE\nDOING THAT, BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE HILLARY\nCLINTON BECOMES PRESIDENT AND LETTING THE FOUNDATION DO THE\nRETOOLING THAT THEY NEED TO DO. >> ALL RIGHT.\nLET'S TALK MORE ABOUT THAT WITH CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST RON\nBROWNSTEIN, A SENIOR EDITIOR FO \"THE ATLANTIC\" AND JAY NEWTON\nSMALLS. IS IT OKAY FOR THE FOUNDATION TO\nCONTINUE TO RECEIVE THIS MONEY UNTIL NOVEMBER?\n>> LOOK, IT'S A REAL QUESTION. THIS IS SUCH UNCHARTED WATERS.\nI MEAN, THAT IS THE ISSUE. THERE'S NO QUESTION THE\nFOUNDATION HAS DONE A LOT OF GOOD WORK OVER THE YEARS ON\nISSUES LIKE AIDS, DRUGS AND AFRICA, IT'S WORKED A LOT WITH\nREPUBLICAN. BUT A UNIQUE SITUATION FROM THE\nBEGINNING THAT'S GOTTEN MORE UNIQUE AND UNPRECEDENTED AS IT'S\nGONE. I DON'T THINK WE'VE EVER HAD A\nFORMER PRESIDENT WHO HAS BUILT AN INSTITUTION OF THIS MAGNITUDE\nTO DEAL WITH AS MANY ISSUES AS PRESIDENT CLINTON HAS DONE\nACTIVATING HIS GLOBAL NETWORK IN THIS WAY AND THEN TO HAVE ON TOP\nOF THAT HIS SPOUSE BECOME FIRST SECRETARY OF STATE, THEN THE\nDEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE, IT REALLY DOES KIND OF CHANGE\nTHE LANDSCAPE. AND I THINK THEY DO NEED TO LOOK\nVERY CAREFULLY AT THIS. BECAUSE MARTIN, I THINK ONE OF\nTHE BIG LESSONS OF ALL THE REVELATIONS WE'VE HAD OVER THE\nPAST MANY MONTHS IS THAT THERE WAS NOT A FULL SENSE OF PROPER\nGUARDRAILS BETWEEN ALL OF THE CLINTON INK AND HILLARY\nCLINTON'S KIND OF RENEWED PUBLIC SERVICE CAREER.\nAND IT IS SOMETHING THAT IF SHE'S ELECTED PRESIDENT, THEY'RE\nGOING TO HAVE TO BE MUCH MORE DILIGENT AND MUCH MORE FOCUSED\nABOUT SEPARATING AND THEY'RE GOING TO NEED SOME VOICES AROUND\nHER WHO ARE MORE ATTUNE TO THIS THAN THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND\nHER IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. >> JAY, EVEN WITHOUT FOREIGN\nMONEY, DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION HAS THE\nPOTENTIAL TO BE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST?\nDOES IT REMAIN A CONFLICT OF INTEREST IF BILL AND HILLARY\nTAKE, YOU KNOW, A HIATUS FROM LEADERSHIP AND, SAY, GIVE IT TO\nCHELSEA? IS IT STILL A PROBLEM?\n>> KEEP IN MINE, THIS IS A CHARITY HERE.\nIT IS NOT LIKE THIS MONEY IS GOING TO THEM PERSONALLY.\n>> RIGHT. >> THE MONEY IS ACTUALLY GOING\nTO BUILD, YOU KNOW, PROGRAMS IN THESE COUNTRIES THAT ARE FOR THE\nBETTERMENT OF THESE PEOPLE. SO WHAT I ALWAYS THINK IS REALLY\nINTERESTING HERE IS WOULD YOU PREFER THAT THESE COUNTRIES NOT\nINVEST IN THEIR OWN DEVELOPMENT? WOULD YOU PREFER THAT IT WAS\nJUST SORT OF MONEY GIVEN, DONATED BY AMERICANS OR DONATED\nBY FIRST WORLD COUNTRIES THAT IS THEN USED TO SORT OF DEVELOP\nTHEM? I MEAN, THAT SORT OF ALSO GOES\nAGAINST -- THEY WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT.\nTHEY WANT TO HAVE A SAY IN HOW THEY'RE DEVELOPED AND THAT'S WHY\nTHEY GIVE MONEY TO THESE PROJECTS.\n>> BUT IT'S THE PERCEPTION HERE. AND WE ALL AGREE IT DOES GOOD.\nIT'S THE PERCEPTION OF A PRESIDENT THAT SOMEHOW -- YOU\nDON'T EVEN WANT TO IMPLY THAT THEY COULD BE INFLUENCED BY A\nDONATION. >> MARTIN, I'M CLOSER TO THE\nIMPLICATION OF YOUR QUESTION, WHICH IS IF HILLARY CLINTON IS\nTHE PRESIDENT, BILL CLINTON IS GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT ADVISER\nWHETHER WITH A FORMAL ROLE OR NOT, HE WILL LITERALLY BE\nWHISPERING IN THE EAR OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nIT MAKES SENSE WHERE TO MAINTAIN THE OPERATION OF THIS FOUNDATION\nIF SHE IS PRESIDENT DURING HER PRESIDENCY.\nTHERE'S NO WAY TO COMPLETELY INSULATE, DESPITE THE GOOD WORK\nTHAT IT DOES, IT DOES PROVIDE KIND OF AN ALTERNATIVE MEANS FOR\nINTEREST NOT ONLY DOMESTICALLY BUT AROUND THE WORLD.\nSO TOO REACH SOMEONE THAT WILL BE WITHIN REACH OF THE\nPRESIDENT. I WOULD IMAGINE -- I'VE GOT TO\nTHINK THAT WHOEVER IS THE CHIEF OF STAFF IN THE WHITE HOUSE WILL\nLOOK VERY HARD AND ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS IF HILLARY CLINTON\nWINS ABOUT WHETHER IT MAKES SENSE TO MAINTAIN THIS\nORGANIZATION. >> AND YOU KNOW, JAY, I'M\nTHINKING THAT FOR ESPECIALLY THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, THEY COULD USE\nTHIS. THIS IS LEVERAGE OBVIOUSLY\nAGAINST HILLARY CLINTON HERE. >> ABSOLUTELY.\n>> AND ONCE AGAIN SEEMS TO REINFORCE A PUBLIC FEELING,\nRIGHT OR WRONG, THAT THE RULES DON'T APPLY THE SAME WAY TO\nHILLARY CLINTON, THE CLINTONS IN GENERAL.\n>> ABSOLUTELY, MARTIN. LOOK, DONALD TRUMP JUST SENT OUT\nA PRESS RELEASE AN HOUR OR AN HOUR AND A HALF AGO CALLING ON\nTHE CLINTONS TO SUSPEND THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nHE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE. THERE HAVE BEEN CALLS ON THE\nHUFFINGTON POST FROM THE LEFT AND FROM THE RIGHT SAYING THAT\nIT'S A MAJOR CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND THEY SHOW JUST SHUT\nIT DOWN FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES EVEN IF SHE WINS THE\nELECTION, EVEN BEFORE THEN, SUSPEND IT RIGHT NOW.\n>> SHUT IT DOWN COMPLETELY OR IS THERE NOT SOME WAY THIS COULD BE\nHANDLED? BECAUSE IT DOES DO A LOT OF\nGOOD. >> WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE PAST\nIS POLITICIANS, MICHAEL BLOOMBERG, WHEN HE BECAME MAYOR\nOF NEW YORK, HE SEPARATED HIMSELF FROM THE PHILANTHROPIES\nTHAT HE WORKED WITH AND THEY CONTINUED ONWARDS.\nIT BECAME A BLIND TRUST. SO IF YOU TREAT THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION LIKE A COMPANY AND YOU ENTRUST SOMEBODY WHO YOU\nREALLY CLOSE FRIEND OR A CLOSE COLLEAGUE, SOMEBODY YOU REALLY\nTRUST WITH THE RUNNING OF IT, I MEAN, THAT SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD\nBE A GOOD SOLUTION. IT CONTINUES TO DO GOOD WORK AND\nSEPARATE FROM THE -- >> WE'VE GOT DONALD TRUMP WHO\nHAS GOT THIS PROBLEM. >> YEAH.\n>> ALL OF THOSE INVESTMENTS THAT NOW ARE NOT GOING TO BE A BLIND\nTRUST. WE UNDERSTAND IT WILL BE, WHAT,\nHANDLED BY FAMILY MEMBERS? >> LOOK, IT IS VERY HARD.\nIT'S AN INTERESTING IDEA THAT YOU COULD HANDLE A PHILANTHROPY\nLIKE A BLIND TRUST, LIKE A COMPANY LIKE YOUR INVESTMENTS.\nAND I THINK FOR BOTH OF THESE CANDIDATES HAVE ENORMOUSLY\nCOMPLICATED FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIPS, BUT TO GET BACK\nTO CLINTON FOR ONE MOMENT, I THINK THAT IF YOU LOOK MORE\nBROADLY AT ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT SHE'S BEEN DEALING WITH IN\nTHE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AS A CANDIDATE, ALL THE SPILLOVER\nFROM THE E-MAILS NOW FROM THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, TO ME WHAT\nIT SAYS IS YOU NEED A STRONG INDEPENDENT VOICE AROUND HER\nTHAT IS A CLEAR SENSE OF KIND OF WHAT THE GUARDRAILS NEED TO BE.\nBILL CLINTON IS AN EXTRAORDINARY HUMAN BEING WHO HAS AN\nEXTRAORDINARY NETWORK GLOBALLY. HE'S A TRUE GLOBAL CITIZEN AND\nHE'S REALLY KIND OF UNMATCHED IN THAT WAY.\nHE HAS TRIED TO LEVERAGE THAT TO ADVANCE THE CAUSES THAT HE CARES\nABOUT, BUT IF ONE OF THE CAUSES HE CARES ABOUT IS THE POTENTIAL\nPRESIDENCY OF HIS WIFE IT MAKES SENSE TO HAVE STRONGER\nBOUNDARIES BETWEEN WHAT HE HAS BEEN DOING AND HIS PUBLIC\nSERVICE THAN THEY HAVE PUT TOGETHER SO FAR.\nI THINK THAT IS GOING TO BE ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT KIND OF\nCOMPLEX JOBS FOR THE NEXT -- IF SHE IS PRESIDENT, THE NEXT CHIEF\nOF STAFF. >> RON, I'M SORRY, I HAVE TO\nWRAP IT THERE ONLY BECAUSE WE'RE ONLY JUST ABOUT OUT OF TIME.\nAND JAY NEWTON SMALL, THANK YOU. WE APPRECIATE YOUR INSIGHTS\nGREATLY.",

SO THE OPTICS HERE COULD BE\nRATHER BAD. THINKING THAT MAYBE HILLARY IS\nTOO CONFIDENT SHE IS GOING TO WIN.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK? >> YEAH, AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR.\nI DON'T THINK THAT THE CAMPAIGN IS TRYING TO GET AHEAD OF\nTHEMSELVES. I THINK THEY ARE TRYING TO\nOUTLINE THE AGENDA IN DETAIL TO PROVIDE WHAT A CLINTON WHITE\nHOUSE WOULD LOOK LIKE. SO VOTERS REALLY WANT THAT\nVISION. LIKE WHAT IS A WHITE HOUSE WITH\nA CLINTON IN IT WITH A DIFFERENT CLINTON IN IT GOING TO LOOK LIKE\nAND HOW WILL THAT DIFFER AND WHAT WILL BE HER PRIORITIES.\nI THINK WITH SO MUCH OF THIS ELECTION GOING BY AND WE ARE SO\nCLOSE AND WE'RE NOT HEARING A LOT ABOUT ISSUES SHE WANTED TO\nPUT THE DETAILS IN THERE AND LAY OUT THE SPECIFICS IF YOU WILL OF\nTHAT BLUEPRINT. >> KRISTIN, THIS COULD BE AN\nADVANTAGE FOR DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE IT COULD GET SOME PEOPLE\nSO FIRED UP ANGRY THAT HILLARY IS EXPECTING TO WIN SO EASILY\nTHAT THEY WILL TURN OUT AND VOTE AGAINST HER.\nBUT I HAVE OTHER ISSUES WITH DONALD TRUMP.\nIF HE DOESN'T PLAN BEYOND WINNING WOULDN'T HE BE\nCRITICIZED FOR THAT TOO? >> HERE IS THE BOTTOM LINE,\nHILLARY CLINTON IS TAKING IT FOR GRANTED THAT SHE WILL WIN WAY\nTOO EARLY.

AND TO BE FAIR, HE HAS RUN A\nRELATIVELY WEAK CAMPAIGN UP UNTIL A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO.\nON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY, WE SAW A MUCH DIFFERENT TRUMP.\nWE SAW TRUMP STRONG, YET HUMBLE. A TRUMP THAT WILL ADMIT TO HIS\nMISTAKES. AND IF HE KEEPS ON THAT PATH,\nHILLARY SHOULD NOT ASSUME SHE IS GOING TO WIN.\nTRUMP COULD APPEAL TO A LOT OF VOTERS IF HE KEEPS ON THIS PATH\nOF STRENGTH, YET BEING HUMBLE AND TALKING ABOUT US, THE\nVOTERS, INSTEAD OF FOCUSSING ON HIMSELF AND PERSONALLY ATTACKING\nHIS CRITICS. >> A NEW TRUMP AND WE COULD LOOK\nFOR THAT. TARYN, ALSO A STAFFER IS SAYING\nIF HILLARY CLINTON WINS, IT WILL BE AN UPHILL BATTLE.\nHERE IS THE QUOTE. I DON'T THINK ANY PRESIDENT HAS\nCOME TO OFFICE UNDER WATER ON THEIR FAVORABLE IMAGE.\nOR AS UNDER WATER. THIS WOULD BE UNCHARTED WATERS\nCOMING TO AN OFFICE AS AN UNPOPULAR PERSON.\nYOU DON'T HAVE A GOODWILL TO DRAW ON EVEN IN THE FIRST 100\nDAYS. HOW WILL THAT AFFECT HER INITIAL\nPRODUCTIVITY, AGAIN, IF SHE WINS.\n>> RIGHT. ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS SHE\nWOULD HAVE TO DO IS DWANE AND WORK FOR REPUBLICAN SUPPORT FOR\nCONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE SHE GETS THAT\nDONE. THAT BEING SAID, I THINK THERE\nIS A LOT OF ROOM FOR HER TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT.\nBECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A LETTER THAT CAME FROM CONGRESSIONAL\nREPUBLICANS, OVER A HUNDRED OF THEM, JUST THE OTHER DAY I'VE\nSEEN THE RNC TO PULL SUPPORT FROM TRUMP.\nI THINK THERE IS FOR HIS DIVISIVENESS AND RECKLESSNESS.\nI THAT I THERE IS DEFINITELY SOME MOVEMENT HERE THAT IF THE\nSCENARIO IS THAT SHE WINS, AND IF SHE WINS, THAT THERE WOULD BE\nSOME MOVEMENT TOWARDS HER AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE BECAUSE I\nTHINK IT IS WINNING WE ALL KNOW IS CLEAR AS THE COUNTRY IS\nCLAMORING FOR IMMIGRATION REFORM.\nTHAT'S WHY WE HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONES.\nAND SPECIFICALLY THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE BIPARTISAN.\nSO WE WOULD HAVE TO REACH ACROSS.\n>> OKAY. I WILL BRING UP SOMETHING ELSE.\nAMIDST THE CHANGES WE HAVE SEEN IN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION ANNOUNCED IT IS NOT GOING TO ACCEPT FOREIGN\nDONATION FESS CLINTON WINS.

WHY NOT DO IT WHILE SHE IS\nRUNNING FOR PRESIDENT? >> THE FOUNDATION IS DOING AN\nENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WORK AND IT TAKES TIME WHEN YOU'RE IN A\nNUMBER OF COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD TO RETOOL, REFOCUS THE\nMISSION, AND ADAPT. AS YOU SAID, THEY RECEIVE A\nGREAT DEAL OF FUNDING THROUGH THESE STREAMS AND IT'LL JUST\nTAKE SOME TIME FOR THEM TO READJUST.\n>> KRISTIN, IS IT OKAY FOR THE FOUNDATION TO CONTINUE TO\nRECEIVE FOREIGN MONEY UP UNTIL NOVEMBER?\n>> ABSOLUTELY NOT. LOOK, THE DAMAGE HAS ALREADY\nBEEN DONE. CLINTON FOUNDATION ACCEPTED TENS\nOF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM FOREIGN ENTITIES.\nIF SHOULD HAVE BEEN SHUT DOWN A LONG TIME AGO.\nBUT THIS JUST SPEAKS TO HOW WEAK A CANDIDATE HILLARY CLINTON IS.\nSHE IS SUCH A BEATABLE CANDIDATE.\nAND THIS IS WHY IT IS SO CRITICAL FOR TRUMP TO STAY ON\nTRACK, FOCUS ON THE ISSUES, AND HE CAN BEAT HER.\nAND MARTIN WE ALSO HAVE TO POINT OUT HERE THAT A LOT OF AMERICANS\nHAVE NOT REALLY TUNED IN CLOSELY TO THIS RACE YET.\nA LOT OF THIS WILL COME DOWN TO THE FIRST DEBATE.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE WILL START PAYING ATTENTION AFTER THE FIRST\nDEBATE AND DURING THE FIRST DEBATE.\nIF TRUMP CAN DO A GOOD JOB THERE HILLARY HAS GOT TO BE CAREFUL.\nSHE SHOULD NOT TAKE FOR GRANTED SHE HAS THIS IN THE BAG.\n>> AND THAT'S WHERE THIS WHOLE CONVERSATION BEGAN.\nTHANK YOU.",

SHE HAS THE MOST AMAZING TEAM.\nSHE HAS THE MOST AMAZING VOLUNTEERS THAT ARE OUT THERE\nKNOCKING DOORS. A LOT OF THEM ARE EDUCATORS.\nI REPRESENT 3 MILLION EDUCATORS THAT WORK IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS,\nCOLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES.

THAT'S WHY WE'VE GOT PEOPLE ALL\nOVER THE COUNTRY WILLING TO WALK NEIGHBORHOODS AND DO WHATEVER IT\nTAKES TO MAKE SURE SHE GETS ELECTED.\nI THINK THEY HAVE TO SHIFT THE DISCUSSION.\nTHEY HAVE TO GET PEOPLE TO, LIKE ON THAT AD, STOP ACTUALLY ASKING\nABOUT ISSUES. BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE\nISSUES, SHE'S GOT PLANS AND HE'S GOT SLOGANS.\nHE'S GOT NOTHING. >> THE ARGUMENT IS THAT WHERE\nHILLARY CLINTON IS GOING TO GET HER MONEY IS FROM THE ELITES ON\nTHE EAST COAST AND THE WEST COAST.\n>> AND EVERYONE IN BETWEEN.

THE 2022 WINTER OLYMPICS ARE\nBEING HELD IN BEIJING, WHICH HAS NO SNOW.\nTHEY'RE BEING HELD THERE -- >> THERE MAY BE BLACK SNOW IF\nTHEY HAVE IT FROM SOOT OR COAL. >> THEY'RE BEING HELD THERE\nBECAUSE THE OLYMPICS HAVE BECOME TOO EXPENSIVE.\nSWEDEN, NORWAY AND POLAND PULLED THEIR BIDS FOR THE WINTER\nOLYMPICS BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD IT.\nIT'S BECOMING VERY DIFFICULT TO PUT ON A REPUTABLE OLYMPICS.\nAND THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE HAS GOT TO GO BACK TO\nTHE DRAWING BOARD ABOUT THE WAY THEY PUT THESE OLYMPICS\nTOGETHER. >> WITH A GOAL OF WHAT?\nPUTTING IN ONE SPECIFIC LOCATION?\n>> ONE OR SEVERAL VENUES THAT ARE PERMANENT, PEOPLE ARE\nTRAINED IN DOING IT, WHERE THE VENUES ARE LIVING UP TO THE\nSTANDARDS. >> THE INFRASTRUCTURE CAN BE\nREUSED.

THEY'RE NEVER USED AGAIN.\nWHEN YOU GO INTO A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY OR A LESS RICH\nCOUNTRIES, YOU A STRONG MAN OR AUTHORITARIAN DEALING WITH\nCONTRACTORS, ENRICHING THEMSELVES.\nI THINK A PERMANENT LOCATION WOULD ALLOW FOR THE\nINFRASTRUCTURE TO BE REUSED.

I'M NOT SAYING IF YOU PUT IT --\nSO YOU PUT IT IN EUROPE, THE EUROPEANS WOULD HAVE AN\nADVANTAGE. YOU PUT IT IN ASIA, THE ASIANS\nWOULD HAVE AN AGREEMENT.

THIS IS THE POLITICALLY\nINCORRECT TRUMP THAT A LOT OF THOSE VOTERS LIKE.\nHE AT LEAST IS GOING TO CALL IT WHAT IT IS.\nHE'S NOT GOING TO PRETEND LIKE THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS,\nLIKE CLINTON ADD. HE'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT -- HE'S\nGOING TO CALL THE THREAT WHAT IT IS, RADICAL ISLAM.\nI THINK THAT IS A WINNING ISSUE FOR HIM.\nTHERE WAS A LOT OF GOOD STUFF IN THAT SPEECH.\nHE TALKED ABOUT CREATING THIS VACUUM THAT ISIS HAS FILLED.\nAT THE SAME TIME, A LOT OF TRUMP'S FOREIGN POLICY IS\nSIMILAR TO OBAMA'S AND THE ISOLATIONIST STRAIN.\n>> I THOUGHT THE CRITIQUE OF THE OBAMA/CLINTON RECORD WAS A LOT\nSTRONGER THAN HIS PROGRAMS AND A LOT CLEARER WHAT HE LAID OUT\nWOULD BE THE DIFFERENCES. IN TERMS OF TAKING OUT ISIS, HE\nSAID HE'LL DO IT FASTER AND VICIOUSLY IF HE HAS TO.\nHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY DETAILS ABOUT HOW TO DO IT OVERSEAS IN SYRIA,\nIRAQ, LIBYA OR ANYTHING ELSE. >> HE HAS SAID A COUPLE THINGS\nTHAT RESONATE. HE WANTS TO WORK WITH ALLIES.\nPEOPLE KIND OF WONDERED ABOUT THAT.\n>> THANK YOU. >> BUT HE'S ALSO -- IT'S A VERY\nFOCUSED STRATEGY. HE'S SAYING I WANT TO KILL ISIS,\nI WANT TO GET RID OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO KILL US.\nI DON'T WANT TO DONATION  -- DO\nNATION BUILDING. A LOT OF PRESIDENTS DEALING WITH\nTHE MIDDLE EAST REGION, I THINK --\n>> TALKS ABOUT COURTING MODERATE MUSLIMS WHICH I THINK IS\nSOMETHING WE NEED TO DO. >> BUT YOU GUYS HAVE LOW BARS --\n>> HOW -- WHAT DO YOU THINK THE BIG DIFFERENCES ARE BETWEEN\nTRUMP'S ANTI-TERROR STRATEGY AND HILLARY CLINTON'S?\n>> WELL, LOOK, I MEAN, HILLARY CLINTON HAS BASICALLY SAID SHE\nWILL CONTINUE BARACK OBAMA'S FOREIGN POLICY STRATEGY AND\nDONALD TRUMP DID VERY WELL CRITIQUE THAT IN THAT SPEECH.\nI THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WOULD MATTER IF HE IS GOING TO\nTALK, AS JASON SAID, MORE OPENLY ABOUT WHAT THE THREAT IS, AND\nTRY TO MAYBE PROSECUTE THIS IN A LOT MORE AGGRESSIVE WAY.\nTHE SPECIFICS, PAUL, THIS IS A PROBLEM, WHAT'S MISSING.\nI DISAGREE A LITTLE BIT WITH JAMES ON THE IDEA THAT THERE IS\nA DISTINCTION HERE BETWEEN TRUMP AND OBAMA ON SOME OF THESE\nQUESTIONS. HE'S BEEN VERY RETICENT FOR\nINSTANCE TO SAY WHAT HE WOULD DO IN SYRIA.\nTHERE ARE THINGS YOU CAN DO THAT ARE SHORT OF BOOTS ON THE\nGROUND, BUT WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THAT COMMITMENT FROM HIM.\nTHIS IS ONE OF THE LACKIN ASPECTS OF HIS FOREIGN POLICY.\n>> I WANT TO GET INTO THE NEWS THIS WEEK THAT THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION -- THIS RELATES TO FOREIGN POLICY BECAUSE THEY HAVE\nACCEPTED FOREIGN DONATIONS IN THE PAST.\nNOW THEY'RE SAYING THEY WON'T ACCEPT ANY FOREIGN DONATIONS.\nTHEY PROMISED EIGHT YEARS AGO THAT THEY WOULDN'T ACCEPT ANY\nFOREIGN DONATIONS WHEN HILLARY WAS SECRETARY OF STATE.\nWHY SHOULD WE BELIEVE THEM NOW? >> WELL, THERE'S NO REASON WE\nSHOULD BELIEVE THEM. FORMER PENNSYLVANIA GOVERNOR ED\nRENDELL SUGGESTED IF SHE WINS, THEY SHOULD CLOSE THE\nFOUNDATION. THEY'RE AFRAID THAT IF THEY KEEP\nTHE FOUNDATION OPEN, SOMETHING WILL BE IN THERE THAT WILL ALLOW\nHILLARY CLINTON TO BE IMPEACHED. >> THEY'LL USE IT AS A\nFUNDRAISER FOR CHELSEA CLINTON'S SENATE CAMPAIGN.\n>> THIS IS MARKET. IT'S LIKE WHEN A CAR DEALER SAYS\nYOU GOT TO GET IN HERE BY LABOR DAY OR THESE DEALS ARE GOING\nAWAY. THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE SAYING.\nWE KNOW IT WILL CONTINUE JUST AS THE DEALERSHIP WILL CONTINUE.\n>> EVEN MORE TO THE POINT, WHAT CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WILL\nSUDDENLY ARISE WHEN SHE'S PRESIDENT THAT WEREN'T THERE\nWHEN SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE, THE CHIEF DIPLOMAT OF THE\nCOUNTRY IN DEALING WITH FOREIGN DONATIONS.\n>> SHOULDN'T THEY SHUT IT DOWN? >> OF COURSE.\n>> KIM, GO AHEAD. >> ALSO BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT\nSAYING YOU'RE NOT GOING TO ACCEPT DONATIONS FROM\nCORPORATIONS OR FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS DOESN'T MEAN\nANYTHING. THOSE STORIES OF THE PAST YEAR\nHAVE SHOWN THAT THESE DONATIONS FROM WEALTHY INDIVIDUALS HAVE\nBEEN ROUTED THROUGH OTHER CHARITIES THAT THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION SAID THEY'LL CONTINUE",

THEY HAVE A FIRE HOSE FEED,\nBASICALLY EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, THEY\nCUT OFF ACCESS. THEY SAID WE DON'T WANT TO DO\nSURVEILLANCE. >> THEY DID NOT LET THE\nGOVERNMENT HAVE ACCESS TO THAT IN.\n>> NO, THEY SHUT OFF ACCESS. >> DO THEY HAVE A POINT OR JUST\nWAY OFF BASE? >> THEY SAID IT WAS BECAUSE THEY\nDIDN'T WANT TO SUPPORT SURVEILLANCE, LOOK LIKE THEY\nWERE COLLABORATING WITH GOVERNMENT.\nTHIS IS A SNOWDEN EFFECT, THE ISSUE WITH APPLE, THE SAN\nBERNARDINO SHOOTER PHONE, SO THINK IT IS A COMBINATION OF\nTHINGS. >> WELL, IT IS TROUBLING AND\nHOPEFULLY WE CAN GET A HANDLE ON IT.\n>> ABSOLUTELY. >> MORGAN, THANK YOU FOR JOINING\nUS.",

THEY DO HAVE THREATS LIKE YOU\nSEE IN THESE BOMBINGS, AND TURKEY HAS BEEN A GREAT ALLY.\nHAVING TURKEY MOVE IN THE WRONG DIRECTION IS REALLY PROBLEMATIC,\nAND WE NEED TO CONTINUE THAT GOOD RELATIONSHIP WE'VE HAD FOR\nMANY DECADES. >> YEAH, THAT WOULD BE A\nMASSIVE, MASSIVE PROBLEM FOR THE UNITED STATES.\nSO BUZZ FEED, WHICH IS A FASHION BLOG THAT HAS A NEWS COMPONENT\nTO IT, HAD A HEADLINE THIS MORNING SAYING IN EFFECT, DONALD\nTRUMP HAS CHANGED COURSE COMPLETELY ON IMMIGRATION.\nHE'S NO LONGER FOR DEPORTATION. IT WAS A STORY ABOUT A MEETING\nHE HAD THE OTHER DAY WITH HISPANIC SUPPORTERS.\nIS THAT TRUE? HAS HE CHANGED HIS VIEW ON\nDEPORTATION? >> HE'S NOT CHANGED HIS VIEW,\nBUT HE HAD A GREAT MEETING WITH PEOPLE WHO HAD DIFFERENT IDEAS\nAND I WASN'T THERE, BUT HE HAD A GOOD DISCUSSION.\nHE LISTENED TO ALL THE DIFFERENT VIEWS.\nLOOK, WE NEED A LAWFUL SYSTEM OF IMMIGRATION.\nTRUMP IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR AND CORRECT ON THAT.\nWE MUST END THE LAWLESSNESS FIRST.\nWE CAN'T TALK ABOUT THESE OTHER ISSUES UNTIL THAT OCCURS.\nI THINK THAT REMAINS HIS FIRM POSITION.\n>> SO THAT ANYWHERE BETWEEN 10 TO 12 MILLION PEOPLE HERE\nILLEGALLY, WHATEVER THE NUMBER. TRUMP HAS SUGGESTED THEY WOULD\nBE REQUIRED TO PHYSICALLY LEAVE THE UNITED STATES, REAPPLY IN\nORDER TO COME BACK LEGALLY. IS THAT --\n>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW THAT HE'S FORMALLY SAID THAT.\nHE DISCUSSED THAT. >> YES.\n>> OTHER PEOPLE HAVE DISCUSSED THAT.\nTHAT'S THE TOUCHBACK IDEA. >> YES.\n>> I'M NOT SURE THAT'S THE BEST SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM, BUT\nIT'S ONE SOLUTION. >> WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE BEST\nSOLUTION? >> WELL, I THINK WE HAVE TO\nFIRST END ALL THE LAWLESSNESS. THIS CAN BE DONE, TUCKER.\nIT'S VERY ACCOMPLISHABLE WITH A STRONG PRESIDENT.\nWE NEED A FEW LAWS WOULD HELP, BUT ACTUALLY YOU COULD DO IT\nWITH CURRENT LAWS. AND THAT'S -- THEN YOU BEGIN TO\nTALK MORE APPROPRIATELY ABOUT WHAT TO DO WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE\nBEEN HERE A LONG TIME. >> SO WHAT ABOUT LEGAL\nIMMIGRATION? WE'VE GOT OVER A MILLION\nLOW-WAGE, LOW-SKILLED WORKERS COMING IN EVERY YEAR INTO AN\nECONOMY THAT CLEARLY CAN'T SUPPORT THEM.\nWOULD TRUMP CHANGE THAT? >> WE'VE GOT TO CONSIDER THAT. CANADA HAS A GREAT SYSTEM WHERE\nTHEY EVALUATE PEOPLE, THEY RATE THEM, THEY GIVE THEM POINTS FOR\nTHINGS THAT ARE GOOD FOR CANADA. AN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM SHOULD\nMEET THE INTERESTS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\nWE NEED TO BRING IN PEOPLE WITH HIGHER SKILLS.\nWE SHOULD LOOK FOR PEOPLE WHO LOVE AMERICA AND VALUE OUR\nVALUES AND WANT TO BE A PART OF THAT, PEOPLE WHO LEARNED ENGLISH\nBEFORE THEY COME SHOULD GET A PREFERENCE OVER PEOPLE WHO CAN'T\nSPEAK THE LANGUAGE. THERE ARE SO MANY RATIONAL\nTHINGS THAT ABSOLUTELY NEED TO BE DONE AS PART OF AN\nIMMIGRATION REFORM THAT I TOTALLY THINK THIS COUNTRY IS\nREADY TO DISCUSS. >> IF YOU RAN YOUR OFFICE OR\nYOUR COMPANY THE WAY WE RUN OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM, JUST LIKE\nGIVING THE FIRST 100 SLOTS TO THE FIRST 100 PEOPLE WHO SHOWED\nUP, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO YOUR COMPANY?\n>> IT JUST MAKES NO SENSE. IT ABSOLUTELY MAKES NO SENSE.\nWE'VE GOT TO FIX THIS. WE CAN DO IT.\nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL SUPPORT IT, BUT WE HAVE POLITICIANS,\nPARTICULARLY DEMOCRATIC LEADERS AND HILLARY CLINTON THAT THEY\nWANT TO GIVE IMMEDIATE AMNESTY TO EVERYBODY, ALLOW THEM ACCESS\nTO EVERY BENEFIT IN AMERICA, AND THEN THEY DON'T WANT TO DO THE\nTHINGS NECESSARY TO GAIN CONTROL OF IMMIGRATION.\nSO THIS IS THE SITUATION THAT'S UNTENABLE.\nIT'S EXTREME. SHE'S TO THE LEFT OF PRESIDENT\nOBAMA. >> BIG TIME.\n>> BIG TIME. IT'S JUST AMAZING REALLY.\n>> SO I LOOK AT THE POLLS EVERY DAY OF THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE,\nGETTING PRETTY CLOSE TO ELECTION DAY REALLY, AND IT LOOKS BAD FOR\nDONALD TRUMP, AND YET I HEAR A LOT OF HIS SUPPORTERS SAY THOSE\nPOLLS AREN'T REAL. ARE THEY REAL?\nIS THERE AN APPRECIATION WITHIN THE CAMPAIGN THAT IT'S NOT ON\nTHE RIGHT COURSE AT PRESENT? >> WELL, POLLS ARE DIFFERENT.\n\"THE LOS ANGELES TIMES\" POLL HAS HIM UP NATIONWIDE.\nTHIS IS A CLOSE RACE RIGHT NOW. WHEN I RAN FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL\nIN ALABAMA THE FIRST TIME I WAS DOWN 14 POINTS IN SEPTEMBER AND\nWON BY 17. PRESIDENT BUSH IN 1988 WAS DOWN\n15 POINTS AT THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION AND WON\nOVERWHELMINGLY, EVERY STATE BUT MASSACHUSETTS AGAINST DUKAKIS.\nSO THIS IS SO FAR TO GO. DONALD TRUMP IS JUST NOW\nBEGINNING TO DRIVE HIS MESSAGE WITH THESE GREAT SPEECHES.\nHE'S SHOWING PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP AND THE FLOOD VICTIMS\nIN LOUISIANA. I THINK THIS CAMPAIGN IS JUST\nBEGINNING TO TAKE OFF. DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO WIN\nTHIS ELECTION. >> SO WHAT'S HIS PITCH TO BLACK\nVOTERS IF YOU COULD BOIL IT DOWN?\n>> THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. HE'S SAYING THAT THE AGENDA\nWE'VE SEEN IN THE BIG CITIES AND OUT OF WASHINGTON FOR THE LAST\n30 YEARS HAVE NOT HELPED YOU, WHICH IS CORRECT.\nTHEY HAVE NOT. YOU BRING IN MORE WORKERS THAN\nWE HAVE JOBS FOR, WHAT DOES THAT DO TO WAGES AND JOB PROSPECTS\nFOR STRUGGLING AFRICAN-AMERICANS WHO WOULD LIKE TO RISE?\nI MEAN, YOU JUST PULLED DOWN WAGES AND YOU PULL DOWN JOBS,\nAND WHEN YOU DO A TRADE POLICY, TUCKER, THAT KILLS\nMANUFACTURING, ELIMINATES HIGH-PAYING JOBS, THAT HURTS OUR\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND HISPANIC COMMUNITIES TOO.\nWE NEED A LEADER THAT CAN CHANGE THIS ECONOMY, GET US ON THE\nRIGHT PATH, END LAWLESSNESS AND IMMIGRATION, FIX OUR TRADE\nPOLICY SO THAT WE CAN HAVE STRONGER MANUFACTURING BASE AND\nBETTER JOBS. THAT WILL BE THE BEST THING\nPOSSIBLE FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS --\n>> BUT HAS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY BEEN PRETTY GOOD THAT CONVINCING\nBLACK VOTERS ALL NONWHITE VOTERS ARE IN THIS TOGETHER.\nTHAT THEY'RE ON THE SAME TEAM SOMEHOW?\n>> IT IS SORT OF AMAZING. IN MY VIEW WE HAVE AS GOVERNMENT\nLEADERS AN ABSOLUTE RESPONSIBILITY TO THE PEOPLE WHO\nARE HERE LAWFULLY IMMIGRATED OR BORN, NATIVE BORN.\nTHAT'S THE FIRST THING. THE IDEA THAT YOU WOULD BRING IN\nMORE WORKERS TO TAKE JOBS WHILE AMERICANS ARE UNEMPLOYED HAVING\nTO GO ON WELFARE IS LUDICROUS. IT MAKES NO SENSE, TUCKER, AND I\nTHINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE GET IT BUT THAT'S --\n>> WHAT'S THE REASON FOR IT? >> THAT'S THE POLICY OF THE\nOBAMA AND CLINTON ADMINISTRATION.\n>> I BET IF YOU POLLED A THOUSAND PEOPLE AND ASKED SHOULD\nWE BRING IN MORE WORKERS THAN WE ARE CREATING JOBS OR WHILE\nAMERICANS ARE UNEMPLOYED, THEY WOULD SAY NO, AND YET IT\nPERSISTS. THAT'S OUR OFFICIAL POLICY.\nWHAT'S THE MOTIVE BEHIND IT? >> THERE'S SEVERAL MOTIVES.\nFIRST, THERE'S A DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL AGENDA AT WORK AND\nTHEN THERE'S A BUSINESS AGENDA AT WORK HERE.\nBUSINESSES WANT MORE WORKERS AT LOWER WAGES.\nTHAT'S WHAT THEY DO. I MEAN, THAT'S THE NATURE OF\nTHEIR BEAST. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT POLITICIANS\nSHOULD LOOK AT. IF YOU'RE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT\nOF THE UNITED STATES, YOU WANT WAGES TO GO UP, NOT DOWN.\nGIVE ME A BREAK. BUSINESSES WOULD LIKE TO SEE\nMORE WORKERS IN LOWER WAGES. THAT'S JUST THE NATURE OF THE\nBEAST. >> DONALD TRUMP ARTICULATED THAT\nCLEARLY, I THINK HE'D WIN 55%, JUST MY GUESS.\nSENATOR SESSIONS, GREAT TO SEE YOU THIS MORNING.\nTHANKS FOR DOING THIS. ANNA AND CLAYTON.\n>> GREAT INTERVIEW.",

AND YOU WILL PROBABLY BE RIGHT.\nIN 2014, ABOUT 30,000 PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN TERROR ATTACKS\nWORLDWIDE. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE\nPERPETRATING THE VIOLENCE WERE MUSLIM.\nBUT -- AND THIS IS IMPORTANT -- SO WERE THE VICTIMS.\nOF THE 30,000 DEAD, THE VAST, VAST MAJORITY WERE MUSLIMS.\nTHAT'S CRUCIAL TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE IT SHEDS LIGHT ON THE\nQUESTION, \"WHY DO THEY HATE US?\" ISLAMIC TERRORISTS DON'T JUST\nHATE AMERICA OR THE WEST. THEY HATE THE MODERN WORLD AND\nTHEY PARTICULARLY HATE MUSLIMS WHO ARE TRYING TO LIVE IN THE\nMODERN WORLD. LET'S BE CLEAR, WHY THE JIHADIS\nARE FEW, THERE'S A LARGER CANCER WITHIN THE WORLD OF ISLAM, A\nCANCER OF BACKWARDNESS AND EXTREMISM AND INTOLERANCE.\nMOST OF THE COUNTRIES THAT HAVE LAWS THAT RESTRICT THE FREE\nEXERCISE OF RELIGION ARE MUSLIM MAJORITY.\nALL THAT HAVE LAWS AGAINST LEAVING THE FAITH ARE MUSLIM\nMAJORITY. BUT ARE THESE THINGS INHERENT IN\nTHE RELIGION? WHEN EXPERTS TRIED TO EXPLAIN IN\nTHE 14th CENTURY ISLAMIC CIVILIZATION WAS THE WORLD'S\nMOST ADVANCED OR THAT THE KORAN WAS ONCE READ AS A LIBERAL AND\nPROGRESSIVE DOCUMENT, THEY ARE NOT TRYING TO DENY THE REALITIES\nOF BACKWARDNESS TODAY. WHAT THEY ARE SAYING IS IT CAN\nCHANGE. ISLAM, AFTER ALL, HAS BEEN\nAROUND FOR 14 CENTURIES. THERE HAVE BEEN PERIODS OF WAR\nBUT ALSO OF PEACE. IT'S THE SAME RELIGION THEN AND\nNOW. SO WHAT IS DIFFERENT?\nIT'S NOT THEOLOGY. IT'S POLITICS.\nRADICAL ISLAM IS THE PRODUCT OF THE BROKEN POLITICS AND STAGNANT\nECONOMICS OF MUSLIM COUNTRIES. THEY HAVE FOUND IN RADICAL\nRELIGION AN IDEOLOGY THAT LETS THEM RAIL AGAINST THE MODERN\nWORLD, AN IDEOLOGY THAT IS NOW BEING EXPORTED TO ALIENATED\nYOUNG MUSLIMS EVERYWHERE, IN EUROPE, EVEN IN SOME RARE CASES,\nIN THE UNITED STATES. SO HOW TO END THIS?\nTHERE'S REALLY ONLY ONE WAY. HELP THE MAJORITY OF MUSLIMS\nFIGHT EXTREMISTS, REFORM THEIR FAITH, AND MODERNIZE THEIR\nSOCIETIES. IN DOING SO, WE SHOULD LISTEN TO\nTHOSE ON THE FRONT LINES. MANY OF WHOM ARE FIGHTING AND\nDYING IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST JIHADIS, THE HUNDREDS OF MUSLIM\nREFORMERS THAT I'VE SPOKEN TO SAID THEIR TASK IS MADE MUCH\nHARDER WHEN WESTERN POLITICIANS AND PUNDITS CONDEMN ISLAM\nENTIRELY, DEMEAN THEIR FAITH, AND SPEAK OF ALL MUSLIMS AS\nBACKWARD AND SUSPECT. HERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO THINK\nABOUT THIS. IN AMERICA, AFRICAN-AMERICANS\nMAKE UP ABOUT 13% OF THE POPULATION YET THEY COMPRISE\nABOUT 50% OF HOMICIDE OFFENDERS, ACCORDING TO A JUSTICE\nDEPARTMENT STUDY. NOW, WE UNDERSTAND, I HOPE WE\nUNDERSTAND, THAT WHEN WE SEE A BLACK MAN ON THE STREET, WE\nCANNOT, MUST NOT TREAT HIM AS A LIKELY CRIMINAL.\nIT WOULD BE DEHUMANIZING, UNFAIR AND RACIST.\nIN AMERICA OF ALL PLACES, PEOPLE SHOULD BE TREATED AS INDIVIDUALS\nAND NOT AS STEREOTYPES FROM A RACIAL, ETHNIC OR RELIGIOUS\nGROUP. REMEMBER, THE BANGLADESHI CAB\nDRIVER WHO DRIVES YOU TO THE AIRPORT HAS NOTHING, NOTHING TO\nDO WITH ISIS EVEN THOUGH HE IS A MUSLIM.\nIT'S HARD NOT TO MAKE THESE QUICK ASSOCIATIONS, ESPECIALLY\nIN THE WAKE OF A TERROR ATTACK. BUT IF AMERICA IS ABOUT\nANYTHING, IT IS THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE JUDGED AS\nINDIVIDUALS WITH INDIVIDUAL LIBERTIES AND RIGHTS.\nIT IS WHAT THEY HATE ABOUT US. WE MIGHT AS WELL LIVE UP TO OUR\nOWN IDEALS. I'M FAREED ZAKARIA.\nTHANK YOU FOR WATCHING.",

OF THE 30,000 DEAD, THE VAST,\nVAST MAJORITY WERE MUSLIMS, THAT'S CRUCIAL TO UNDERSTAND,\nBECAUSE IT SHEDS LIGHT ON THE QUESTION, WHY DO THEY HATE US?\nISLAMIC TERRORISTS DON'T JUST HATE AMERICA OR THE WEST, THEY\nHATE THE MODERN WORLD, AND THEY PARTICULARLY HATE TRYING TO LIVE\nIN THE MODERN WORLD. LET'S BE CLEAR.\nWHILE THE JIHADIS ARE FEW, THERE IS A LARGER CANCER WITHIN THE\nWORLD OF ISLAM, A CANCER OF EXTREMISM AND INTOLERANCE, MOST\nHAVE LAWS THAT RESTRICT THE FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION OR THE\nMAJORITY. ARE THESE THINGS INHERENT IN THE\nRELIGION? WHEN EXPERTS TRY TO EXPLAIN THAT\nIN THE 14th CENTURY ISLAMIC COUNTY -- THEY'RE NOT TRYING TO\nDENY THE REALTIES OF BACKWARDNESS TODAY, WHAT THEY'RE\nSAYING IS IT CAN CHANGE. ISLAM AFTER ALL HAS BEEN AROUND\nFOR 14 CENTURIES, THERE HAVE BEEN PERIODS OF WAR, BUT ALSO OF\nPEACE. IT'S THE SAME RELIGION THEN AND\nNOW, SO WHAT IS DIFFERENT? IT'S NOT THEOLOGY, IT'S\nPOLITICS. RADICAL ISLAM IS THE PRODUCT OF\nTHE BROKEN POLITICS AND STAGNANT ECONOMICS OF MUSLIM COUNTRIES.\nTHEY HAVE FOUND IN RADICAL RELIGIOUS AN IDEOLOGY THAT LETS\nTHEM RAIL AGAINST THE MODERN WORLD, AN IDEOLOGY THAT'S NOW\nBEING EXPORTED TO ALIENATED YOUNG MUSLIMS EVERYWHERE, IN\nEUROPE, EVEN IN SOME RARE CASES IN THE UNITED STATES.\nSO HOW TO END THIS? THERE'S REALLY ONLY ONE WAY.\nHELP THE MAJORITY OF MUSLIMS FIGHT EXTREMISTS, REFORM THEIR\nFAITH AND MODERNIZE THEIR SOCIETIES.\nIN DOING SO, WE SHOULD LISTEN TO THOSE ON THE FRONT LINES, MANY\nOF WHOM ARE FIGHTING AND DYING IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST JIHADIS,\nTHE HUNDREDS OF MUSLIM REFORMERS I HAVE SPOKEN TO SAY THEIR TASK\nIS MADE MUCH HARDER WHEN WESTERN POLITICIANS AND PUNDITS CONDEMN\nISLAM ENTIRELY, DEMEAN THEIR FAITH AND SPEAK OF ALL MUSLIMS\nAS BACKWARD AND SUSPECT. HERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO THINK\nABOUT THIS, IN AMERICA, AFRICAN-AMERICANS MAKE UP ABOUT\n13% OF THE POPULATION, YET THEY COMPRISE ABOUT 50% OF HOMICIDE\nOFFENDERS, ACCORDING TO A JUSTICE DEPARTMENT STUDY.\nNOW WE UNDERSTAND, I HOPE WE UNDERSTAND, THAT WHEN WE SEE A\nBLACK MAN ON THE STREET, WE CANNOT, MUST NOT TREAT HIM AS A\nLIKELY CRIMINAL, IT WOULD BE DEHUMANIZING, UNFAIR, AND\nRACIST. IN AMERICA OF ALL PLACES, PEOPLE\nSHOULD BE TREATED AS INDIVIDUALS AND NOT AS STEREOTYPES FROM A\nRACIAL, ETHNIC OR RELIGIOUS GROUP.\nREMEMBER, THE BANGLADESHI CAB DRIVER WHO DRIVES YOU TO THE\nAIRPORT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ISIS, EVEN THOUGH IT IS ALSO A\nMUSLIM. IT'S HARD NOT TO MAKE THESE\nQUICK ASSOCIATIONS, ESPECIALLY IN THE WAKE OF A TERROR ATTACK.\nBUT IF AMERICA IS ABOUT ANYTHING, IT IS THE IDEA THAT\nPEOPLE SHOULD BE JUDGED WITH INDIVIDUALS WITH INDIVIDUAL\nLIBERTIES AND RIGHTS, IT IS WHAT THEY HATE ABOUT US.\nWE MIGHT AS WELL LIVE UP TO OUR OWN IDEALS.\nI'M FAREED ZAKARIA, THANK YOU",

TYPICALLY BY THIS POINT IN A\nSTORM I THINK RED CROSS WOULD BE RECEIVING A LOT MORE DONATIONS.\nI THINK THERE WOULD BE MORE VOLUNTEERS SIGNING UP, ALTHOUGH\nWE HAVE SOME OF THAT IN PLACE NOW.\nIT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL IF PEOPLE WOULD DONATE TO THE RED\nCROSS, TO THE BATON ROUGE AREA FOUNDATION AND ALSO TO COME IN\nAND VOLUNTEER TO HELP PEOPLE GET BACK IN THEIR HOMES AS QUICKLY\nAS POSSIBLE. >> AS THE WATER RECEDES TODAY,\nDEVASTATED RESIDENTS ARE BEGINNING TO CLEAN UP WADING\nTHROUGH INCHES OF MUD THAT HAVE BURIED THEIR BELONGINGS.\nAT LEAST 40,000 HOMES HAVE BEEN DAMAGED.\nJOINING ME NOW IS LIEUTENANT GENERAL RUSSELL HONORE WHO\nCOMMANDED THE MILITARY RESPONSE TO HURRICANE KATRINA.\nWE MET ON THE STREETS OF NEW ORLEANS DURING KATRINA.\nGENERAL HONORE IS IN LOUISIANA HELPING WITH THE RECOVERY NOW.\nLET ME ASK YOU, SIR, FROM YOUR PROFESSIONAL OUTLOOK, WHAT IS\nYOUR BIGGEST CONCERN AT THE MOMENT?\n>> WELL, I THINK AS THE GOVERNOR SAID, WE GET THE RIGHT SCOPE OF\nTHIS DAMAGE. YOU USE 40,000.\nWE'RE CLOSE TO 110,000 HOMES AND 7300 BUSINESSES THAT TOOK WATER\nAND EITHER DAMAGED OR HEAVILY DESTROYED.\nAND OVER 281,000 PEOPLE THAT HAD TO EVACUATE.\nSO THE NUMBERS HAVEN'T SETTLED YET, MARTIN, BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN\nCOMPETING WITH ALL THESE OTHER STORIES ABOUT POLITICS AND ABOUT\nATHLETES, AND I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE TO TELL THAT STORY, BUT\nWE'VE GOT A SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE BECAUSE IT'S A CASCADING EFFECT\nOF SCHOOLS AND PARISHES BEING UNDER WATER.\nAND SOME PARISHES, OVER 70% OF THE HOMES TOOK WATER AND ALL OF\nTHE SCHOOLS. SO WE'VE GOT A CATASTROPHIC\nEVENT ON OUR HANDS, AND WE'RE COMPETING WITH WHETHER SOME\nSWIMMER WAS ARRESTED OR NOT TO GET THAT STORY TO THE AMERICAN\nPEOPLE BECAUSE WE KNOW WHEN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW WHAT HAS\nHAPPENED TO THE CITIZENS HERE, THEY'LL REACH OUT.\nA NUMBER WE NEED TO CORRECT. THE 30 MILLION YOU SPOKE OF\nEARLIER, THAT'S A RED CROSS ESTIMATE FOR WHAT IT'S GOING TO\nTAKE FOR THEM TO RUN THE SHELTERS FOR THE FIRST MONTH.\nTHAT 30 MILLION. THAT DOESN'T EVEN COME CLOSE TO\nCOVERING THE DAMAGE WE HAVE IN ALL THESE HOMES, MARTIN.\n>> WELL, LET ME ASK YOU THIS. YOU OBVIOUSLY BEING IN THE ARMY,\nFORMERLY, KNOW LOGISTICS. LOGISTICALLY, WHAT IS THE\nGREATEST NEED RIGHT NOW FOR PEOPLE?\n. PEOPLE NEED RIGHT NOW IS TO\nFINISH CLEANING THEIR HOMES AND TO GET A FAIR ASSESSMENT FROM\nFEMA ON THE AMOUNT OF MONEY FEMA WILL ALLOW THEM.\nYOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE NOT A PART OF THE FEDERAL FLOOD INSURANCE\nPROGRAM, FEMA WILL ALLOW YOU $33,000, BUT THE AVERAGE THAT\nTHEY LOAN OUT IS ABOUT $7,000. THAT'S A BIG GAP, MARTIN.\nWE DIDN'T HAVE HIGH NUMBERS OF INSURANCE PEOPLE HERE.\nIN TERMS OF A RATIO OF PEOPLE TO HOMES AND INSURANCE.\nWE'RE VERY LOW ON THAT BECAUSE WE GOT A GAP HERE.\nSOMETHING IS MISSING IN BETWEEN THE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THE\nBANKERS TELLING PEOPLE WHETHER THEY LIVE IN A WETLANDS OR NOT.\nWE HAVE TO FIX THAT BECAUSE WE'RE WAY UNDERINSURED, NUMBER\nONE. AND NUMBER TWO, WHAT FEMA ARE\nOFFERING IS $7,000. YOU CANNOT REPLACE ALL THIS\nSTUFF ON THE STREET BACK HERE\n                            <u>%-p.</u> FEMA IS GOING TO HAVE TO ADJUST\nTHEIR NUMBERS OR THIS COMMUNITY, MANY PEOPLE WILL NOT GET BACK IN\nTHEIR HOMES AND THIS WOULD HAVE A CATASTROPHIC EFFECT ON THE\nCHEMICAL CORRIDOR FOR AMERICA THAT WE RUN HERE AS WELL AS THE\nPETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY BECAUSE PEOPLE CANNOT MOVE BACK IN THEIR\nHOMES, MARTIN. >> THERE IS OFTEN A QUICK JUMP\nTO WANT TO COMPARE OR TRY TO COMPARE WHAT IS GOING ON IN\nLOUISIANA NOW TO WHAT HAPPENED WITH HURRICANE KATRINA.\nI NEVER LIKE TO EVER COMPARE ONE PERSON'S MISERY TO ANOTHER.\nIS THERE A COMPARISON TO BE MADE REGARDING THOSE TWO TRAGIC\nEVENTS? >> WELL, I THINK YOU SPEAK AGAIN\nTHAT MOTHER NATURE CAN BREAK ANYTHING BUILT BY MAN.\nAND IF WE BUILD IT BAD, IT CASCADES THAT.\nWE BUILT INTERSTATE 12, WENT THROUGH FIVE YEARS OF\nCONSTRUCTION, AND WE PUT A CONCRETE BARRIER IN THE MIDDLE\nOF THE ROAD.

HE'S NOT JUST SAYING WE'RE ALL\nFEELING, WE'RE ALL DISGUSTING, HE'S ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT\nMEDIA CRITIQUE THAT'S JUST NOT BEING COVERED.\n>> THE ESTABLISHMENT MEDIA DOESN'T COVER WHAT'S REALLY\nHAPPENING IN THIS COUNTRY OR WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON IN\nPEOPLE'S LIVES. JUST IMAGINE IF THE MEDIA SPENT\nTIMES AND LOTS OF TIME INVESTIGATING THE POVERTY AND\nJOBLESSNESS OF THE INNER CITIES. JUST THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH\nDIFFERENT THINGS WOULD BE IF THE MEDIA IN THIS COUNTRY SENT THEIR\nCAMERAS TO OUR BORDER, TO OUR CLOSING FACTORIES, OR TO OUR\nFAILING SCHOOLS. >> DONALD TRUMP, ASSIGNMENT\nEDITOR, I WOULD SAY SOME OF THAT IS BEING COVERED, BUT KURT, I\nWONDER WHEN YOU HEAR FROM DONALD TRUMP, IS HE BASICALLY\nSUGGESTING WHAT HIS PITCH WOULD BE FOR A MEDIA COMPANY AFTER HE\nLOSES, THIS IS WHAT HIS CHANNEL WOULD BE ALL ABOUT?\n>> THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THERE IS A BROADER PLAY BEING PLANNED\nABOUT THE TRUMP BRAND BEING EXTENDED BEYOND THE ELECTION.\n>> I THINK THERE'S AN UNDER ESTIMATION OF TRUMP AND -- WHEN\nMEDIA ENTITY IN STEVE BANNON, WHEN YOU KNOW HE'S REGULARLY\nHAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH ROGER AILES WHO WAS AT THE TOP OF FOX\nNEWS. LOOK WHAT HE'S DOING AND LOOK AT\nHIS MESSAGING. HE'S MAKING THE CASE EVERY DAY,\nOF WHEN HE LOSES THIS ELECTION IT WILL BE BECAUSE THE MEDIA HAD\nIT OUT FOR HIM AND WE NEED AN ALTERNATIVE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT\nDOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. IT WRITES HIMSELF.\n>> WHAT DO HIS ALLIES NEED TO KNOW IF THEY DO WANT TO LAUNCH A\nMEDIA COMPANY? >> I GUESS I'LL DISAGREE A\nLITTLE BIT WITH THAT NARRATIVE. THIS IS ABOUT EXTENDING THE\nTRUMP BRAND PAST NOVEMBER, BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S ABOUT\nNECESSARILY LAUNCHING A NEW MEDIA ORGANIZATION.\nTHE MEDIA ORGANIZATION THAT IS THE CRITIQUE THAT DONALD TRUMP\nJUST DESCRIBED AS BEEN AROUND SINCE ANDREW BREITBART.\nI THINK THIS IS ABOUT EXTENDING THE TRUMP AND THE POPULOUS BRAND\nSO IT'S NOT A TRANSITIONAL BRAND LIKE THE TEA PARTY OR THE DAVE\nBRATS OF THE WORLD. IT IS ABOUT IN MY MIND WHAT\nHAPPENS NEXT AFTER NOVEMBER IN TERMS OF THE FUTURE OF THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY. CAN THE RIGHT BECOME THE RIGHT?\nAND I THINK THAT'S THE NATURE OF THE CONVERSATION.\n>> ONE THING I KNOW THAT STEVE HAS BEEN INTERESTED IN FOR A\nLONG TIME, IS TO EXTEND BREITBART TO EXTEND THE CABLE\nMEDIA. >> IF TRUMP LOSES, WILL HE TRY\nTO LAUNCH A CHANNEL? IT'S VERY HARD IN THIS DAY AND\nAGE TO LAUNCH A NEW CHANNEL, BUT IF ANYBODY'S GOING TO DO IT, IT\nWILL BE DONALD TRUMP AND STEVE BANNON.\nWE'LL TALK ABOUT TRUMP SUPPORTERS SKEPTICISM IN SOME OF\nTHE NATIONAL POLLS YOU SEE.

THE MEDIA HAS A LOVE\nRELATIONSHIP WITH HILLARY CLINTON.\nSHE SAYS THE RIGHT THINGS ABOUT THE VALUE OF JOURNALISM, BUT SHE\nDOES PRINT A PROBLEM FOR THE PRESS, IT'S HER LACK OF\nACCESSIBILITY. MORE THAN TRUMP AND HIS\nSURROGATES. >> HILLARY CLINTON AVOIDS DOING\nPRESS CONFERENCES. BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T WANT TO\nANSWER THE QUESTIONS. >> I KNOW HERE PEOPLE ACHBLTD\nHER SUPPORTERS ARE PROTECTING HER BY NOT LETTING HER TALK TO\nTHE PRESS. I'M HAPPY TO TALK TO YOU, BUT\nSHE DOESN'T RESPECT YOU THE WAY WE DO.\n>> HILLARY CLINTON HAS CONTINUOUSLY REFUSED TO HAVE A\nPRESS CONFERENCE IN ONE FULL YEAR.\nDONALD TRUMP CONTINUOUSLY CALLS INTO TV SHOWS, CONTINUALLY DOES\nPRESS CONFERENCES. >> HILLARY CLINTON IS SO\nPROTECTED, SHE HASN'T HAD A NEWS CONFERENCE IN LIKE 150 DAYS.\n>> \"THE WASHINGTON POST\" HEADLINE CALLS IT RIDICULOUS\nTHAT CLINTON HAS NOT HAD A PRESS CONFERENCE SINCE LAST DECEMBER.\nTHERE'S DEBATE ABOUT WHAT A PRESS CONFERENCE IS AND WE'LL\nGET INTO THIS. BUT WE WANT TO GET INTO\nCLINTON'S PRESS STATTY. WE DID REACH OUT FOR A\nSPOKESPERSON, BUT THEY DECLINED TO COME ON THE PROGRAM THIS\nMORNING. SO LET'S GO TO A PERSON WHO HAS\nEXPERIENCE WITH COVERING CLINTON.\nA WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT WHO'S ALSO COVERING THE\nPRESIDENTIAL RACE FOR NPR. GOOD MORNING, GOOD TO SEE YOU.\nTHE LAST PRESS CONFERENCE WAS IN DECEMBER, FULL-FLEDGEDRESS\nCONFERENCE, WHY DOES THAT MATTER?\n>> IT'S UP TO 260 DAYS ON THE COUNTER THAT T\"THE WASHINGTON\nPOST\" HAS SET UP. WHY DOES IT MATTER?\nSHE HAS BEEN AVAILABLE IN INTERVIEWS, SHE HAS DONE WHAT\nYOU WOULD CALL LIKE A GAGGLE OR A SCRUM IN AN ICE CREAM SHOP\nWHERE SHE TAKES FIVE OR SIX QUESTIONS, USUALLY ON THE NEWS\nOF THE DAY. WHAT WOULD BE REALLY USEFUL WITH\nA PRESS CONFERENCE IS THAT PRESS CONFERENCES KIND OF BUILD ON\nTHEMSELVES. THINK OF A PRESIDENTIAL PRESS\nCONFERENCE, SOMEBODY ASKS THE FIRST QUESTION, AND THE FIRST\nANSWER IS THE ANSWER THEY WANT TO GIVE.\nAND THEN YOU LOOK FOR THE THING THAT THEY'RE LEAVING OUT.\nIF THERE IS A PARTICULAR ISSUE THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET\nINFORMATION ON. SO WITH THE PRESS CONFERENCE,\nYOU CAN PULL OUT MORE INFORMATION, OR YOU CAN -- OR IT\nWILL BE MORE CLEAR THAT THE CANDIDATE SIMPLY ISN'T\nANSWERING. >> THAT'S THE JOURNALISTIC\nREASON. THERE'S ALSO THE STRATEGY ABOUT\nWHY SHE'S NOT GIVING A PRESS CONFERENCE?\nSHE'S TRYING TO SIT ON HER LEAD, RIGHT?\n>> FROM A PURELY STRATEGIC STANDPOINT.\n>> BUT REALISTICALLY, AND FOR THE PUBLIC DISCOURSE, WE'RE\nRIGHT TO DEMAND PRESS CONFERENCES, AREN'T WE?\n>> I WANT A PRESS CONFERENCE, ABSOLUTELY.\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS ITS OWN PODCAST NOW, WHERE HILLARY\nCLINTON IS TALK DIRECTLY TO HER VOTERS.\nSHE ISN'T THE FIRST PERSON WHO INVENTED THIS, PRESIDENT OBAMA\nHAD FEWER PRESS CONFERENCES THAN PRESIDENT BUSH DID WHO HAD FEWER\nPRESS CONFERENCES THAN PRESIDENT CLINTON DID.\nAS THEY HAVE FOUND WAYS TO GO AROUND US, THEY DON'T NEED TO\nUSE US TO GET THEIR INFORMATION OUT IN THE SAME WAY, AND THEY\nSIMPLY, FROM A STRATEGIC STANDPOINT FOR THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN, THERE ISN'T A LOT OF UPSIDE IN DOING THE PRESS\nCONFERENCE BECAUSE I THINK THE PUBLIC WOULD BENEFIT FROM OUR\nASKING QUESTIONS. >> THE ANSWER THAT I GOT, IS\nTHAT SHE ANSWERS QUESTIONS ALL THE TIME.\nSHE'S DONE 375 INTERVIEWS. THAT ISN'T EXACTLY WHAT IT\nSOUNDS LIKE, 375 INTERVIEWS, SOME OF THOSE ARE VERY SHORT,\nWITH LOCAL REPORTERS, WHAT WOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A VERY\nACCESSIBLE INTERVIEW, RIGHT? >> I DID GET TO DO AN INTERVIEW\nOF HER. IT WAS THE DAY THAT PRESIDENT\nOBAMA ENDORSED HER. SO I WAS TOLD I HAD THREE\nMINUTES FOR AN INTERVIEW. SO WHEN YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES\nFOR THE INTERVIEW AND THERE'S NEWS, YOU TEND TO ASK MORE ABOUT\nTHE NEWS AND YOU DON'T GET INTO POLICY QUESTIONS, LIKE HOW TO\nMAKE TPP A BETTER POLICY. >> SHE RECENTLY HAD A PRESS\nCONFERENCE WITH THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF BLACK JOURNALISTS\nAND HISPANIC JOURNALISTS, DID SHE TAKE QUESTIONS FROM\nJOURNALISTS? >> SHE DID TAKE QUESTIONS FROM\nJOURNALISTS, BUT IT WAS NOT A PRESS CONFERENCE TYPE\nENVIRONMENT. IT DID FEEL TO ME LIKE A PANEL\nOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. IT DID NOT HAVE THE FEEL OF AN\nEXTENDINGED PRESS CONFERENCE. >> JOURNALISTS ARE ALWAYS GOING\nTO TO ADVOCATE FOR MORE PRESS\nCONFERENCES. THERE HAVE BEEN THESE CONSPIRACY\nTHEORIES FLOATING AROUND RPGS THEY STARTED KIND OF IN THE\nFEVER SWAMPS OF FOX NEWS. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT RUDY\nGIULIANI SAID ON FOX NEWS SUNDAY.\n>> FAILS TO POINT OUT SEVERAL SIGNS OF ILLNESS BY HER.\nWHAT YOU GOT TO DO IS GO ONLINE. >> HER CAMPAIGN AND A NUMBER OF\nPEOPLE DEFENDING HER SAYS THERE'S NOTHING FACTUAL TO THE\nCLAIMS ABOUT HER HEALTH. >> GO ONLINE AND PUT IN HILLARY\nCLINTON ILLNESS, AND LOOK FOR YOURSELF.\n>> I'M PRETTY WORRIED ABOUT HIM SAYING GO ONLINE AND GOOGLE IT.\nBUT FROM THE CLINTON BEAT REPORTER PERSPECTIVE, HAVE YOU\nTRIED TO ASK ABOUT HER HEALTH AND HAVE YOU PERCEIVED ANY\nISSUES ABOUT HER HEALTH? >> I HAVE NOT ASKED ABOUT HER\nHEALTH, I HAVE NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT.\nTHEY HAVE PUT OUT A STATEMENT FROM HER DOCTOR.\nI HAVE BEEN THERE FOLLOWING HILLARY CLINTON AROUND, I DON'T\nQUITE KNOW HOW SHE DOES IT, BECAUSE MY HEALTH IS SUFFERING\nFOLLOWING HER. IT'S A GRUELING SCHEDULE.\n>> YOUR HEALTH IS SUFFERING FOLLOWING HER?\nBECAUSE IT'S SO MANY HOURS, SO MANY DAYS IN A ROW?\n>> I DON'T GO TO THE GYM ANYMORE, I DON'T GET ENOUGH\nSLEEP, THIS IS MY DREAM JOB, BUT SHE'S UP THERE GIVING SPEECHES\nAND ALL I'M DOING IS WRITING STORIES.\n>> BUT TO BE CLEAR, THIS WEEK SHE'S OUT DOING FUND-RAISERS,\nSHE'S NOT ON VACATION THIS WEEK, RIGHT?\n>> SHE'S RAISING A LOT OF MONEY THIS WEEKEND.\nWE'LL FIND OUT EXACTLY HOW MUCH WHEN THE FINAL REPORTS COME OUT.\nBUT SHE STACKS UP THE FUND-RAISERS.\n>> BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCRETE EVIDENCE\nOF ANY KIND OF ILLNESS. >> NOT FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEN AND\nI HAVE BEEN PRETTY CLOSE TO THE CANDIDATE.\nI HAVE SEEN STOOLS, BUT TIM KAINE SITS ON THEM TOO.\n>> I'M SITTING ON A STOOL RIGHT NOW.\n>> SO AM I. >> THANKS FOR BEING HERE, GOOD\nTO SEE YOU. >> I'M GLAD THE CAMERAS DON'T\nFOLLOW ME AROUND EVERY DAY.

THE HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS\nALREADY BRACING FOR A SCORCHED EARTH STRATEGY.\nLET'S GET SOME INFORMATION FROM TWO PEOPLE WHO KNOW ABOUT\nBREITBART. HE RESIGNED EARLIER T-- EXCLUSIE\nPROFILE OF BANNON. YOU INTERVIEW BANNONFOR YOUR\nPROFILE. WHEN YOU SEE THIS COVERAGE OF\nBANNON THIS WEEK, DID WE ACCURATELY COVER HIM AS A STREET\nFIGHTER WHO WILL HELP TRUMP GET TO THE WHITE HOUSE?\n>> I THINK THERE'S A FAIR CHARACTERIZATION OF STEVE\nBANNON. HE'S AN INTERESTING CHARACTER.\nHE MADE IT UP THROUGH THE RANKS OF GOLDMAN-SACHS, AND HAS NOW\nBUILT BREITBART.COM AS A LEGITIMATE MEDIA ORGANIZATION.\nAND HE'S A PROVOCATEUR BY HITTING STORIES THAT REALLY GET\nHIS AUDIENCE GOING IN VERY VITRIOLIC WAYS.\n>> LET'S GET SOME DETAIL ABOUT THAT.\nKIRT, I KNOW YOU HAVE STRONG \u00e2\u0096 FEELINGS ABOUT BREITBART, I KNOW\nYOU WERE DISGUSTED BY HOW BREITBART TREAT --\n>> REALLY FOR THE LAST YEAR, YEAR AND A HALF IN THE\nREPUBLICAN PRIMARY, THEY HAVE BEEN THE RAPID RESPONSE ARM OF\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

YOU'RE SAYING IT'S EVEN FURTHER\nTO THE RIGHT THAN FOX NEWS? >> THEY MAKE FOX NEWS LOOK LIKE\nMSNBC, I THINK THAT ANY TIME THERE WAS A CONTROVERSY,\nSOMETHING THAT TRUMP MAY HAVE SAID THAT WAS GENERATING\nHEADLINES, BREITBART WAS THE FIRST DESTINATION THAT YOU COULD\nGO DO AT THE TIME TO SEE WHAT THE DONALD TRUMP SIDE OF THE\nSTORY WAS. IF ANYONE WOULD MISCHARACTERIZE\nTRUMP -- >> YOU WERE THE FORMER CEO OF\nNPR, AND DOES IT DISTURB YOU TO HAVE A RAPID RESPONSE ARM FOR\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, IS IT INAPPROPRIATE TO HAVE THAT KIND\nOF MERGER HAPPENING? >> SO, LOOK, THAT MERGER\nHAPPENED, IT IS TRUMP-BART AS PEOPLE HAVE KNOWN IT.\nI DON'T THINK OF BREITBART AS A NEWS MEDIA ARM.\nI THINK A LOT ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IS -- YOU KNOW, THEY'RE\nNOT -- THEY'RE A COMPETITOR OF FOX NEWS, BUT THEY HATE FOX\nNEWS, THEY HATE THE REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT, THAT'S REALLY\nWHAT THIS IS ABOUT. SO IT'S A POLITICAL MOVEMENT,\nAND IT'S THE ALIGNMENT OF TWO POLITICAL FIGURES, TRUMP AND\nBANNON TO TRY TO POLITICIZE MEDIA.\n>> AFTER THE RISE OF SARAH PALIN IN THE '08 CAMPAIGN, THE FAR\nRIGHT REALLY DIDN'T HAVE ANY BLASE TO GO.\nWE SAW THE FAR RIGHT THAT RESULTED IN REPUBLICANS TAKING\nBACK THE HOUSE, BUT THERE WAS A STRING OF ELECTORAL FAILURES AS\nTHEY TRIED TO MAKE ON MITCH McCONNELL AND THE CHRIS McDANIEL\nRACE IN KANSAS. THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE DIDN'T HAVE\nA PLACE TO GO THAT WAS CENTRALIZED NOR A POLITICAL\nFIGURE TO GET BEHIND. AND TRUMP AND BREITBART.COM TO\nORGANIZE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DONALD TRUMP.\n>> YOU'RE SUCH A CRITIC OF THIS SITE.\nI WANT YOU TO SAY ONE NICE THING ABOUT BREITBART.\n>> WHAT THEY DO IN MOTIVATING THEIR AUDIENCE, AND PLAYING TO\nTHE AUDIENCE'S PASSION. AND STEVE BANNON HAS GONE FROM\nWHAT MANY CONSIDER AS AN OUTLIER, NOT PART OF ANY MAIN\nSTREAM POLITICAL FORCE TO BECOMING THE NUMBER ONE GUY FOR\nTHE CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE OTHER ADVISORS SURROUNDING TRUMP, IT'S\nNOT PRETTY CLEAR THAT ROGER AILES, THE OUSTED FOX NEWS CEO\nIS ALSO IN TRUMP'S INNER CIRCLE. DANA BASH ASKED CONWAY ABOUT\nTHIS, LET ME PLAY HER COMMENT FIRST, TAKE A LOOK.\n>> IS ROGER AILES ACTIVELY ADVISING DONALD TRUMP AT THIS\nPOINT? >> HE OBVIOUSLY HAS NO FORMAL OR\nINFORMAL ROLE IN THE CAMPAIGN, BUT MR. TRUMP SPEAKS TO MANY\nDIFFERENT PEOPLE. ROGER AILES IS A GENIUS WHEN IT\nCOMES TO TELEVISION AND WHEN IT COMES TO COMMUNICATING WITH\nPEOPLE, BUT SO IS TRUMP. >> SHE'S THREADING A NEEDLE\nHERE, SAYING AILES IS ADVISING TRUMP, THE MAN, BUT NOT ADVISING\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. GIVEN THE CONTROVERSY ABOUT THE\nSEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS AGAINST AILES?\n>> I WOULD SAY THAT'S PROBABLY THE LEAST OF THE CHALLENGES FOR\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. I MEAN, WHAT TRUMP IS DOING I\nTHINK NOW IS SURROUNDING HIMSELF WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE AN\nINSTINCTIVELY AND PRACTICED KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HOW TO\nCOMMUNICATE WITH A CERTAIN PART OF THE REPUBLICAN PUBLIC.\nTHEY ARE GOOD, THEY'RE PROBABLY THE BEST THERE ARE ADVISING ON\nHOW TO CONNECT WITH HIS AUDIENCE, IT MAY BE EXPANDING A\nLITTLE BIT, BUT IT'S REALLY NOT HOW CAN DONALD TRUMP BE TRUMP IN\nTHE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY.

WELL, SHE SAID IN ONE OF THE\nINTERVIEWS THIS WEEK THAT DONALD TRUMP WENT OVER THE SPEECH WITH\nA PEN, IT WAS NOT HER WORDS AND OF COURSE SHE WOULD SAY THAT.\nWHAT ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE MEDIA, AMY, THE MEDIA WERE\nSTUNNED BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP NEVER APOLOGIZED FOR ANYTHING\nBUT HE WASN'T SPECIFIC ABOUT WHICH COMMENTS AND TO WHOM HE\nCOULD BE EXPRESSING REGRET. >> DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF HAS SAID\nIT IS PART OF HIS LIFE STRATEGY TO ALWAYS IT BACK AND ALWAYS\nRETALIATE AND NEVER LET A CHARGE GO UNANSWERED SO FOR HIM TO NOW\nBE OFFERING WHAT SEEMED TO BE AN APOLOGY, NEWSWORTHY AND NEWS\nMAKING, BUT FOR THE PRESS TO IMMEDIATELY DISMISS IT AND\nPSYCHO ANALYZE DONALD TRUMP I DON'T THINK THAT IS FAIR,\nEITHER, AND THE REPORT THIS WEEK WE RELEASED A POLL THAT FOUND\n52% OF LIKELY VOTE ARE THINK THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS THE\nBEST MEDIA COVERAGE SO FAR IN THE CAMPAIGN.\n>> THE RELATED QUESTION, THEN, WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH THE MINI\nPIVOTS BEFORE WHERE HE GIVES SCRIPTED SPEECHES AND EVERYONE\nSAID, HE IS MORE DISCIPLINED AND IT DOES NOT LAST.\nSO WAS THE SKEPTICISM JUSTIFIED? >> ABSOLUTELY.\n SAYS, YOU KNOW, JUST HISTORICALLY, YOU\nLOOK BACK, SOMEONE WHO SAYS I'M CONCERNED, IN I HAVE HURT\nANYONE, LIKE YOU SAID, THERE IS A NOTE, NO SPECIFIC APOLOGY AND\nNO SPECIFICS TO WHO HE OFFENDED OR WHAT HE FEEL REMORSEFUL OR\nREGRET ABOUT. THIS IS THE MAN THAT TALKED\nABOUT PUNCHING MICHAEL BLOOMBERG IN THE FACE, A MAN WHO CARED\nABOUT HIMSELF AFTER THE ORLANDO FACT AND FELT THAT A MAN WHOSE\nSON DIED FOR THE COUNTRY WAS ATTACKING HIM.\n>> AND EVERYONE THINKS THAT WAS A POLITICAL MISTAKE BUT HE WHAT\nDENOUNCED AT THE CONVENTION. NOW, BACK TO THIS QUESTION ON\nPAUL MANAFORT WOULD LASTED FOUR MONTHS OR SO AS THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN MANAGER. \"NEW YORK TIMES\", HEIDI PRZBYLA,\nDID THE FIRST OF SEVERAL PIECES ABOUT HIS TIES AS A GUY WHO HAS\nBEEN A LOBBYIST FOR YEARS TO UKRAINE AND HOW LEDGERS WERE\nDISCOVERED THAT SEEMED TO SHE $12 MILLION IN CASHIER MARKED\nFOR PAUL MANAFORT AND HE DENIED HE EVER RECEIVED THE MONEY AND\nDENOUNCED \"NEW YORK TIMES\" BUT WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE STORY?\nWAS THAT STORY FAIR? >> IT TOOK A GOOD READ OVER THAT\nAND HERE IS MY ASSESSMENT, A GOOD EXAMPLE WHERE THE NARRATIVE\nKIND OF MAKES THE STORY COMPARED TO THE SPECIFIC FACTS IN THE\nSTORE BECAUSE GOING INTO THIS, WE ALL KNOW THAT MANAFORT HAD\nTIES TO BIG RUSSIAN MONEY AND PARTICULARLY TO SOMEONE WHO IS\nCORRUPT AS THEY COME. GOING INTO THAT, WE HAD THE\nPREFORMED IMPRESSION AND WE LOOK AT THE FACT THEY ARE HANDWRITTEN\nLEDGERS, AN ASSERTION, BASICALLY AN ASSERTION FROM A UKRAINE\nAGENCY THAT WE ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH.\nMANAFORT COULD DENY IT. SO LOWER IN THE STORY THE\nINVESTIGATOR SAID THIS WAS IN PROOF HE RECEIVED THE MONEY AND\nIT WRITES US, WHY IS THIS NEWS? IT IS NEWS BECAUSE OF WHAT WE\nKNEW PREVIOUSLY THAT THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO\nMEN THAT IS TROUBLING BECAUSE OF WHO THIS MAN IS.\n>> A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE PRESS JUMP TO THE CONCLUSIONS IT WAS\nTHE STORIES OF THE RUSSIAN TIES AND THE UKRAINE RELATIONSHIP\nTHAT SUNK PAUL MANAFORT BUT I AM TOLD THAT DONALD TRUMP WHILE NOT\nHAPPY ABOUT THAT WAS MORE UPSET ABOUT LEAKY \"NEW YORK TIMES\"\nTEASE \"INSIDE THE FAILED MISSION TO TAME DONALD TRUMP\nORGANIZATION HIS ADVISORS SAYING HE IS NOT COACHABLE AND FRANCE\nHE FINDINGED THE FINGER PRINTS OF MANAFORT WERE ON THAT PIECE.\n>> I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IN THAT IS CASE BECAUSE DONALD\nTRUMP DOES NOT LIKE LEAKS THAT HE CANNOT BE TAMED.\nBACK TO THE RUSSIAN STORY, PART OF WHAT FUELED THE MEDIA\nCOVERAGE OF THAT IS IT DOVETAILED WITH THE VLADIMIR\nPUTIN AND DONALD TRUMP BROMANCE AND THE KIND WORDS THEY HAVE FOR\nEACH OTHER. YOU NOTICE BURIED WAY IN THE\nPRINT WAS THAT THE PODESTA GROUP, THEY, ALSO, ARE UNDER\nSCRUTINY AND LOOKING AT MAINSTREAM MEDIA YOU WOULD THINK\nIT WAS ONLY ABOUT PAUL MANAFORT. >> I WANT TO CLOSE THIS SEGMENT\nAND ASKING YOU, LESLIE, ABOUT THE VOLUME, THE GUSHER OF\nANTI-TRUMP STORY AND HEADLINES COMPARED TO HILLARY CLINTON AND\n\"POLITICO\" \"REGRETFUL DONALD TRUMP PIVOTS 107 DAYS LATER.\"\nOR \"NEW YORK TIMES\" $630 MILLION IN DEBT,\" AND WORRIES THAT THIS\nWILL LOWER ALL BOATS BUT ANOTHER, HILLARY CLINTON IS\nLAYING PLANS FOR THE WHITE HOUSE AGENDA AS IN THE RACE IS OVER.\n>> I SAID IT BEFORE IT IS NOT RIGHT FOR ANY OUTLET NOT\nREPORTING ALL OF THE FACTS AND THAT IS WHAT A TRUE JOURNALIST\nSHOULD DO. FRANKLY, DIRT ON DONALD,\nANYTHING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP IS MORE ATTRACTIVE TO READERS AND\nTO VIEWERS AND LISTENERS THAN INFORMATION ABOUT HILLARY\nCLINTON SO IN IT PLEADS, IT LEADS OR IN IT HAD DONALD'S NAME\nIT LEADS. >> WHICH UNBALANCED THE\nCOVERAGE. >> AND BEFORE BREAK, SUPPOSEDLY\nHE SAID HE WILL LOSE SO GOOD, AND THE PIECE SAID HIS SHAKEUP\nCOULD BE AN INTENTIONAL EFFORT TO TANK THE ELECTION IN\nSPECTACULAR FASHION, TALK ABOUT AN UNSUPPORTED PIECE OF\nSPECULATION.

BUT LIKE YOU SAID, THIS WAS\nLITERALLY EVOLVING MINUTE BY MINUTE, AND YOU HAD KELLYANNE,\nTHE NEW CAMPAIGN ESSENTIALLY CONFIRMING HE WAS\nASKED TO LEAVE. IT'S NOT THESE THINGS CAN'T\nBE -- THAT BOTH SIDES AGREE MUTUALLY TO LEAVE.\nBUT I THINK THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE REALLY COMPETING\nINTERESTS TRYING TO SPIN THE INTERESTS HERE.\nCLEARLY MANAFORT WANTED TO PRESERVE HIS DIGNITY ON THE WAY\nOUT THE DOOR, AND TRUMP DIDN'T WANT THIS TO BE VIEWED AS A\nHEMORRHAGING. >> YOU CAN PRACTICALLY IMAGINING\nTHE REPORTERS SCRAMBLING TO REACH MORE SOURCES ON MANAFORT,\nSOME ANTI-MANAFORT AND GET SOME APPROXIMATION OF THE TRUTH.\nOF COURSE, AMY, WHEN THE SHAKEUP HAPPENS IT'S A BOMBSHELL FOR THE\nCAMPAIGN. PUNDITS REACTED SAYING IT\nDOESN'T REALLY MATTER, TRUMP IS THE PROBLEM.\nWAS THAT A BIT DISMISSIVE? >> I THINK IT WAS.\nAND WE'VE SEEN SINCE DONALD TRUMP HIRING KELLYANNE CONWAY\nTHAT HE HAS BEEN MAKING THIS PRESIDENTIAL PIVOT.\nIRONICALLY AFTER FIRING THE GUY THAT SAID IT WAS GOING TO\nHAPPEN, IT'S HAPPENED UNDER KELLYANNE BECOMING THE NEW\nCAMPAIGN MANAGER. WE'LL SEE IF IT LASTS.\nAND I, YOU KNOW, DONALD TRUMP WE KNOW HAS BEEN A VERY VOLATILE\nCANDIDATE. AND OF COURSE HE DESERVES MEDIA\nSCRUTINY, BUT I THINK HE ALSO DESERVES CREDIT FOR AT LEAST\nMAKING THESE INITIAL ATTEMPTS. >> BUT MOSTLY I WOULD SAY THE\nPRESS WAS EITHER PUZZLED BY THIS, LESLIE MARSHALL, OR\nNEGATIVE TOWARD IT. I KNOW YOU'RE NO TRUMP FAN, BUT\nHOW MUCH OF THE COVERAGE DO YOU THINK WAS INFLUENCED BY THE\nINCREASINGLY HOSTILE TONE IN THE PRESS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND HIS\nCANDIDACY? >> WELL, I THINK QUITE FRANKLY\nANY TIME TRUMP OPENED HIS MOUTH, EVERYBODY WOULD COVER IT BECAUSE\nHE'S GOOD FOR RATINGS. I MEAN, THAT'S THE REALITY AND\nTHAT'S A REAL BOTTOM LINE. I DON'T THINK TRUMP HAD ANY\nDISSERVICE. WE HAVE TO LOOK HISTORICALLY,\nTHIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST SHAKEUP WE'VE SEEN IN A\nPRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, AT LEAST IN THE MOST CURRENT ELECTIONS IN\nMODERN DAY. AND I THINK THERE WAS ALSO -- I\nMEAN, THERE WAS ADDITIONAL ELEMENT.\nIT WASN'T JUST THAT HE WAS TAKING A NOSE DIVE IN THE POLLS\nAND MAKING YET ANOTHER CHANGE IN HIS CAMPAIGN STAFF.\nBUT THERE WAS ALSO THE CONNECTIONS WITH RUSSIA AND THE\nUKRAINE AND EVEN THE QUESTION OF LEGALITY.\nI HEARD SOME HISTORIANS SAY BACK IN THE DAY THIS WOULD BE TREASON\nAND SOMEBODY WOULD BE HUNG FOR THIS.\n>> WE'LL COME BACK TO THE MANAFORT QUESTION.\nLET ME GET HEIDI IN ON THIS QUESTION.\nWE PLAYED IT AT THE TOP TRUMP GIVING A SCRIPTED SPEECH IN\nWHICH HE SAYS HE REGRETS SOME OF HIS PAST COMMENTS.\nAND I THINK IT WOULD BE FAIR TO SAY MOST OF THE PRESS REACTION\nWAS SKEPTICAL, DID HE REALLY MEAN IT OR WAS HE BEING FED\nTHESE LINES? >> THERE WAS DEFINITELY SOME\nSKEPTICISM. AND SOME OF IT EVEN BORDERED ON\nSNARK. I SAW ONE STORY SAY, WELL, IT\nWASN'T REALLY AN APOLOGY BECAUSE HE DIDN'T SAY THE WORD SORRY.\nBUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE WAS SOME LEGITIMATE REASONS FOR\nSKEPTICISM HERE. MOST OF ALL THIS IS JUST NOT IN\nCHARACTER FOR TRUMP BECAUSE HE'S BEEN ASKED ALONG THE WAY AS HE'S\nMADE THESE CONTROVERSIAL COMMENTS IF HE REGRETS THEM.\nAND EACH TIME HE SAID NO. IT ALSO COINCIDES ALMOST\nPERFECTLY WITH KELLYANNE COMING IN AS HIS NEW CAMPAIGN MANAGER\nKNOWING THAT SHE WANTED TO GIVE HIM -- TO SOFTEN UP HIS IMAGE A\nBIT. SO YOU QUESTION WHETHER THAT'S\nCOMING LEGITIMATELY FROM HIS HEART OR FROM HER FROM A\nCAMPAIGN PERSPECTIVE. THAT SAID, YOU KNOW, HE DID SAY\nTHE WORDS AND IT WAS A PRETTY BIG DEAL.\n>> RIGHT. RIGHT.\nWELL, KELLYANNE CONWAY SAID IN ONE OF HER MANY INTERVIEWS THIS\nWEEK THAT DONALD TRUMP WENT OVER THE SPEECH WITH A PEN.\nIT WASN'T HER WORDS. OF COURSE SHE'S GOING TO SAY\nTHAT. AMY, WHAT ABOUT THE FACT THAT\nTHE MEDIA, LOOK, LET'S FACE IT, THE MEDIA WERE STUNNED BECAUSE\nTRUMP NEVER APOLOGIZES FOR ANYTHING, ALTHOUGH HE WASN'T\nSPECIFIC ABOUT WHICH COMMENTS AND TO WHOM HE MIGHT BE\nEXPRESSING REGRET. >> RIGHT.\nAND DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF HAS SAID IT'S A PART OF HIS SORT OF\nLIFE STRATEGY TO ALWAYS HIT BACK AND ALWAYS RETALIATE, NEVER LET\nA CHARGE GO UNANSWERED. SO FOR HIM TO NOW BE OFFERING\nWHAT SEEMED TO BE AN APOLOGY OF COURSE WAS NEWSWORTHY AND NEWS\nMAKING. BUT FOR THE PRESS TO IMMEDIATELY\nDISMISS IT AND PSYCHOANALYZE DONALD TRUMP, I DON'T THINK\nTHAT'S FAIR EITHER. AND AT RASMUSSEN REPORTS THIS\nWEEK, WE RELEASED A POLL THAT FOUND 52% OF LIKELY VOTERS THINK\nTHAT THE MEDIA THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS GOT THE BEST MEDIA\nCOVERAGE SO FAR IN THIS CAMPAIGN.\n>> THE RELATED QUESTION HERE IS WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THE SORT OF\nMINIPIVOTS BEFORE WHERE TRUMP GIVES A COUPLE SCRIPTED\nSPEECHES, NOW HE'S A MORE DISCIPLINED CANDIDATE AND IT\nDOESN'T LAST. SO IS SKEPTICISM ON THIS ROUND\nJUSTIFIED? >> I THINK IT IS ABSOLUTELY\nJUSTIFIED. WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO SAYS,\nYOU KNOW, JUST HISTORICALLY, WHEN YOU LOOK BACK SOMEBODY JUST\nSAYS I'M CONCERNED IF I'VE HURT ANYONE LIKE YOU HAD SAID, THERE\nIS ONE NOTE ACTUAL SPECIFIC APOLOGY, TWO, THERE ARE NO\nSPECIFICS TO WHO HE HAS OFFENDED AND WHAT HE FEELS REMORSEFUL,\nYOU KNOW, HAS REGRET ABOUT. AND, I MEAN, THIS IS THE MAN\nTHAT TALKED ABOUT PUNCHING MICHAEL BLOOMBERG IN THE FACE.\nTHIS IS A MAN WHO CARED ABOUT HIMSELF AFTER THE ORLANDO\nTERRORIST ATTACKS AND ALSO FELT THAT A MAN WHOSE SON DIED FOR\nTHIS COUNTRY WAS ATTACKING HIM. AND THEN ATTACKED THE MOTHER FOR\nTHE SILENCE. >> YOU CAN CERTAINLY CRITICIZE\nTRUMP'S RESPONSE. EVERYBODY THINKS IT WAS A\nPOLITICAL MISTAKE, BUT HE WAS DENOUNCED BY MR. KHAN AT THE\nCONVENTION. THE \"NEW YORK TIMES,\" HEIDI, DID\nTHIS BIG PIECE, IT WAS THE FIRST OF SEVERAL PIECES OF HIS TIES --\nTHE GUY'S BEEN A LOBBYIST FOR YEARS TO UKRAINE AND HOW LEDGERS\nWERE DISCOVERED THAT SEEMED TO SHOW $12 MILLION IN CASH BEING\nEARMARKED FOR PAUL MANAFORT. MANAFORT'S VEHEMENTLY DENIED HE\nEVER RECEIVED ANY OF THAT MONEY. HE DENOUNCED \"NEW YORK TIMES.\"\nWHAT'D YOU MAKE OF THAT STORY? DIDN'T PROVE HE GOT THE\nPAYMENTS. WAS THAT STORY FAIR?\n>> I TOOK A GOOD READ, HOWIE, AND THIS IS MY ASSESSMENT.\n. I THINK THIS IS AN EXAMPLE THE\nNARRATIVE MAKES THIS STORY VERSUS SPECIFIC FACTS IN THIS\nSTORY. GOING INTO THIS WE ALL KNOW THAT\nMANAFORT HAD TIES TO BIG RUSSIAN MONEY AND TO YANUKOYVICH, WHO IN\nPARTICULAR IS AS CORRUPT AS THEY COME.\nSO GOING INTO THAT WE HAD THE PREFORMED CONFESSION.\nLOOK AT THE FACTS. THESE ARE HANDWRITTEN LETTERS,\nIT'S AN ASSERTION FROM A UKRAINIAN AGENCY THAT WE'RE NOT\nFAMILIAR WITH. MANAFORT COULD EASILY DENY IT.\nSO, YOU KNOW, EVEN LOWER DOWN IN THE STORY THE INVESTIGATORS HAD\nSAID THERE WAS NO PROOF HE ACTUALLY RECEIVED THE MONEY.\nSO THAT KIND OF BRINGS US BACK TO WHY IS THIS NEWS?\nWELL, THIS IS NEWS BECAUSE OF WHAT WE KNEW PREVIOUSLY WHICH IS\nTHERE IS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO MEN THAT IS TROUBLING\nIN AND OF ITSELF BECAUSE WHO YANUKOYVICH IS.\n>> YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE PRESS JUMP TO THE\nCONCLUSION, AMY, THAT IT WAS THESE STORIES ABOUT THE RUSSIAN\nTIES AND THE UKRAINIAN RELATIONSHIP THAT SUNK PAUL\nMANAFORT. I'M TOLD BY MY SOURCES THAT\nDONALD TRUMP WHILE NOT HAPPY ABOUT THAT DISTRACTION WAS MUCH\nMORE UPSET WITH THE STORY WE TALKED ABOUT LAST SUNDAY WHICH\nWAS BIG LEAKY \"NEW YORK TIMES\" PIECE, HIS OWN ADVISOR SAYING\nDONALD TRUMP IS NOT COACHABLE AND PERHAPS CONCLUDED MANAFORT'S\nWERE FAIRLY ON THAT PIECE. >> WELL, I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED\nIF THAT WAS THE CASE THAT DONALD TRUMP DID NOT LIKE HAVING THESE\nLEAKS IN THE PRESS THAT HE CAN'T BE TAMED.\nBUT I THINK GETTING BACK TO THE RUSSIA STORY, PART OF ALSO WHAT\nFUELED THE MEDIA COVERAGE OF THAT IS THAT IT DOVETAILED WITH\nTHE VLADIMIR PUTIN/DONALD TRUMP STEAMY BROMANCE AND THE KIND\nWORDS THEY'VE HAD FOR EACH OTHER.\nBUT IF YOU LOOK AT THESE ARTICLES TOO, YOU NOTICE BURIED\nWAY DOWN IN THE PRINT WAS THAT THE PADESTA GROUP, HILLARY\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN MANAGER'S BROTHER, THEY'RE ALSO UNDER\nSCRUTINY. BUT LOOKING AT MSM, MAINSTREAM\nMEDIA, YOU WOULD THINK IT WAS ONLY ABOUT PAUL MANAFORT.\n>> RIGHT. I JUST WANT TO CLOSE THIS\nSEGMENT ASKING YOU, LESLIE, ABOUT JUST THE VOLUME, GUSHER OF\nANTI-TRUMP HEADLINES VERSUS THOSE INVOLVING HILLARY CLINTON.\nPIVOT 107 DAYS LATE. \"NEW YORK TIMES,\" IN TRUMP'S IN\nDEBT, GOP WORRIES ALL BODES. BUT TODAY ON THE FRONT PAGE,\nWITH A COMFORTABLE LEAD CLINTON BEGINS LAYING PLANS FOR HER\nWHITE HOUSE AGENDA, ALMOST AS IF THE RACE WAS OVER.\n>> I'VE SAID IT BEFORE, I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT THAT ANY OUTLET\nIS NOT REPORTING ALL THE FACTS. THAT'S WHAT A TRUE JOURNALISTIC\nSOURCE SHOULD DO. BUT AGAIN, QUITE FRANKLY, DIRT\nON DONALD, ANYTHING ABOUT DONALD JUST IS MORE ATTRACTIVE TO\nREADERS AND TO VIEWERS AND TO LISTENERS THAN INFORMATION ABOUT\nHILLARY CLINTON. AND SO IF IT BLEEDS, IT LEADS,\nOR IF IT HAS DONALD TRUMP'S NAME IN IT IT LEADS.\n>> TRUE. BEFORE WE GO TO BREAK, THE NEW\nYORK DAILY NEWS COVER SUPPOSEDLY TRUMP SAYING I'M GOING TO LOSE\nSO GOOD. THIS PIECE ACTUALLY SAYS THAT\nHIS SHAKEUP COULD BE AN INTENTIONAL EFFORT TO TANK THE\nELECTION IN SPECTACULAR FASHION. TALK ABOUT A COMPLETELY\nUNSUPPORTED PAR SPECULATION. YOU CAN WRITE TO US\nATMEDIABUZZ.COM. WHEN WE COME BACK, CLOSER LOOK\nAT THE CONTROVERSIAL BREITBART MEDIA OPERATION THAT PRODUCED\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN'S NEW CEO. AND LATER, THE PASSING OF JOHN\nMcWHO INFLUENCED NUCH OF WHAT YOU SEE TODAY ON CABLE NEWS.                  They feel good?      No...",
