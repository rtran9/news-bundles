THE TIMING, MORE THAN A LITTLE\nCURIOUS. DONALD TRUMP OF LATE HAS BEEN\nMUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE IN QUESTIONING CLINTON'S ETHICS.\n>> WHILE OUR COUNTRY LOST BADLY UNDER HILLARY CLINTON, SHE\nCASHED IN BIG-TIME. THERE WAS ALL THE MONEY FUNNELED\nINTO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION FROM FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND\nCORPORATIONS. IT WAS PAY FOR PLAY.\nIN A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, THE STATE DEPARTMENT WILL WORK FOR\nTHE COUNTRY, NOT FOR HILLARY CLINTON'S DONORS.\n>> IT'S NOT JUST THE CANDIDATE. THE NEW CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN COMES FROM A CONSERVATIVE WEBSITE WHICH HAS\nLONG ACCUSED THE CLINTONS OF CORRUPTION.\n>> A NEW REPORT TODAY CLAIMS THE CLINTON FOUNDATION GIVES ABOUT\n10% OF ITS MONEY THAT IT RAISES TO ACTUAL CHARITIES.\n>> ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY HAVE FLOWED TO THE CLINTONS FROM\nFOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, FOREIGN FINANCIERS AND BUSINESSES.\n>> NOW, THIS CHANGE, IF SHE BECOMES PRESIDENT, AND THERE ARE\nALREADY PEOPLE SEEING LOOPHOLES IN THE CHANGE, BUT -- SURPRISE,\nYEAH -- WE WON'T TAKE FOREIGN MONEY, WON'T TAKE CORPORATION\nMONEY. BILL CLINTON WON'T GIVE PAID\nSPEECHES. HE IS NOT GIVING ANY RIGHT NOW.\nCO THE BOSTON GLOBE SAID A WEEK AGO\nSHE SHOULD SHUT IT DOWN THEY SAY WHY DIDN'T IT POSE A PROBLEM AS\nSECRETARY OF STATE. THE ANSWER IS IT DID AND DOES\nAND THEY KNOW IT. >> THE CLINTONS WILL GET AWAY\nWITH WHATEVER THEY CAN FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.\nIT VIOLATE THE SPIRIT OF ETHICAL AGREEMENTS OR LAWS.\nTHIS IS HOW THEY DO BUSINESS. TRUMP AND SHE ARE FIGHTING ON\nEQUALLY UNLIKABLE UNPOPULAR GROUNDS HERE.\nTHIS IS ANOTHER THING WHERE, HAD SHE DONE IT SIX MONTHS AGO, THE\nSTORY WOULD BE DIFFERENT NOW. HE IS WILLING TO BE EXTREMELY\nFRANK ABOUT HER BEHAVIOR. THAT WILL BE A WEAKNESS FOR HER.\n>> THIS WILL BE AN INTERESTING DEBATE.\nWHETHER TRUMP CAN CARRY THIS IN THE DEBATE OR WHETHER SHE TURNS\nTHE TRUMP INDUSTRIES AND FINANCES --\n>> HE HAS A CLEANER ARGUMENT NOW THAT MANAFORT IS NO LONGER WITH\nTHE CAMPAIGN. HE WAS A BIT OF A LIABILITY\nBECAUSE OF HIS OVERSEAS DEALINGS AS WELL.\nI THINK THIS IS A POWERFUL ARGUMENT THAT THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN -- THAT TRUMP HIMSELF CAN MAKE.\nIT'S SORT OF -- EITHER REAL CORRUPTION OR THE SPECTER OF\nCORRUPTION. A WHIFF OF PAY FOR PLAY.\n>> CAN YOU EXPECT THIS WOMAN TO CHANGE WASHINGTON.\n>> WE DID AN ANALYSIS OVER THE WEEKEND THAT FOUND HALF OF THE\nMONEY WOULD HAVE FALLEN UNDER THE RULES THAT ARE NOW BANNED\nFOR DONATION. IT'S A REAL THING FOR THEM THAT\nGOING BACK TO HER STATE DEPARTMENT YEARS, SHE WAS -- HER\nFAMILY FOUNDATION WAS ACCEPTING MONEY FROM FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS\nAND ENTITIES IN WAYS THAT THEY ARE ACKNOWLEDGING IS BASICALLY\nUNETHICAL -- OR WOULD BE UNETHICAL COME NOVEMBER.\n>> THEIR BIG GATHERING IS THIS FALL.\nSO IT WILL COME UP AGAIN. >> THE FACT THAT SHE WAS DOING\nTHIS WHILE SECRETARY OF STATE, TAKING I MEAN BIG MONEY FROM THE\nSAUDIS, FOR EXAMPLE. WHERE ARE THE ADS?\nIT'S ONE MORE EXAMPLE OF JUST -- IF YOU HAD A FUNCTIONAL\nOPPOSITION, CAN YOU IMAGINE THE KIND OF ATTACKS THAT COULD BE\nLAUNCHED? NOW AT ALMOST LABOR DAY TO SAY,\nIF SHE IS PRESIDENT WE'LL SHUT IT DOWN.\nIT'S SUCH EASY FODDER. ONE FAST POINT.\nTHIS IS PART OF HER CHALLENGE WITH YOUNGER VOTERS.\nTHIS IS PART OF THE REASON WHY SHE WAS VULNERABLE AGAINST\nBERNIE. NOT BECAUSE OF IDEALOGICAL\nISSUES BUT THE SPECTER AND UNSEEMLINESS OF SOME OF THEIR\nFINANCIAL DEALINGS. IT SEEMS SO CYNICAL.\nTHIS IS PART OF HER CHALLENGE. TRUMP HAS BEEN A GIFT, BUT THIS\nIS PART OF HER CHALLENGE, WINNING OVER YOUNGER, MORE\nIDEALISTIC VOTERS. >> YOU HAVE JUDICIAL WATCH ABOUT\nTRYING TO GET THE E-MAILS OUT. IT FILES A LOT OF SUITS TO GET\nGOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS. IF YOU ARE A FAN OF\nTRANSPARENCY, YOU SHOULD SUPPORT THAT ASPECT.\nA JUDGE HAS SAID THEY WANT TO DEPOSE HER.\nTHE JUDGE SAID NO. YOU DON'T GET A DEPOSITION IN\nPERSON BUT SHE'LL ANSWER WRITTEN QUESTIONS.\nWE SAW REPORTS THIS WEEK THAT IN HER FBI INTERVIEW SHE SAID, I\nHAD THE PERSONAL E-MAIL ACCOUNT BECAUSE COLIN POWELL TOLD ME\nTHAT'S THE WAY TO DO THINGS. IS THERE A POSSIBILITY -- SHE\nAND HER LAWYERS WILL ANSWER THE QUESTIONS FROM JUDICIAL WATCH.\nI ASSUME THEY'LL BE EXTRA CAREFUL BUT IT STILL RAISES THE\nPER POSSIBILITY THAT WE'RE NOT DONE\nHERE. >> MOST PEOPLE IN THE POLLS\nTHINK SOMETHING UNETHICAL HAPPENED.\nBUT THEY ALSO SUGGEST PEOPLE ARE SICK OF HEARING ABOUT HER\nE-MAILS. THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS VOTING\nON THE LATTER, THEY HAVE TO BE WORRIED ABOUT THE DRIP, DRIP,\nDRIP OF THIS AND IF THEY CAN ESSENTIALLY START TO LOSE THIS\nTHING SORT OF A DEATH BY A THOUSAND CUTS.\n>> EVEN WHILE VOTERS ARE MAYBE SICK OF THE SORT OF ATMOSPHERE\nOF TALKING ABOUT THESE E-MAILS AND THE CONTROVERSY, EVERY TIME\nTHAT SOMETHING COMES OUT THAT'S CONCRETE LIKE THESE MOST RECENT\nE-MAILS THAT REVEALED THINGS ABOUT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION OR\nWHATEVER WE MAY HEAR FROM HER FBI INTERVIEWS OR FROM THE\nDEPOSITIONS TO COME, IT GIVES MORE CONCRETE FODDER FOR VOTERS\nTO LATCH ONTO. SO THEY CAN SAY IT'S NOT JUST\nTHAT THEY FEEL SHE IS UNTRUSTWORTHY BUT THEY CAN POINT\nTO SOMETHING.

YOU HAVE PRESIDENT OBAMA OFF\nGOLFING, NOT WILLING TO BREAK INTO HIS VACATION.\nFOR SOME REASON HILLARY CLINTON IS TAKING A COUPLE OF DAYS OFF\nTO REST. AND THE ONE TEAM THAT WANTED TO\nGO DOWN AND LOOK AT WHAT HAS BEEN CALLED THE WORST DISASTER\nIN THE LAST FEW YEARS WAS, IN FACT, TRUMP AND PENCE.\nI THINK IT'S SENDING THE EXACTLY THE RIGHT SIGNAL OF CONCERN AND\nCOMPASSION AND WILLINGNESS TO GO TO WHERE PROBLEMS ARE AND TO\nHAVE THE ENERGY AND DRIVE TO DO IT.\n>> WELL, THAT LEADS ME TO MY NEXT QUESTION WITH YOU BECAUSE I\nKNOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN A BIG ADVOCATE OF HAVING DONALD TRUMP\nGO DIRECTLY TO PLACES TO CONNECT WITH AMERICANS WHERE THERE ARE\nREAL PROBLEMS IN OUR COUNTRY. AS YOU POINTED OUT WE SAW HIM\nMEETING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT IN MILWAUKEE, TRAVELING TO\nLOUISIANA TO GET A FIRST-HAND LOOK AT THE DEVASTATION FROM THE\nFLOODS AND TALK WITH FOLKS WHO ARE REALLY HURTING RIGHT NOW.\nSO YOU POINT OUT THE PRESIDENT IS STAYING ON VACATION.\nDO YOU THINK THAT THIS IS GOING TO PUT THE DEMOCRATS NOW ON\nDEFENSE BECAUSE TRUMP IS RIGHT THERE WHERE THINGS ARE HAPPENING\nAND HE'S MEETING DIRECTLY WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO HAVE A\nDIRECT IMPACT ON THE THAT HE'S GOING BEYOND THE\nRALLIES ON THE ROAD RIGHT NOW? >> WELL, I THINK THERE ARE TWO\nCONTRASTS THAT ARE STRIKING. ONE IS THAT TRUMP CARE WES\nENOUGH TO SHOW UP AND BECOME DOESN'T AND STAYS PLAYING GOLF.\nTHE OTHER IS THAT TRUMP HAS THE SHEER ENERGY AND DRIVE TO GET ON\nTHE AIRPLANE AND GO TO LOUISIANA.\nI CAN'T IMAGINE WHY HILLARY CLINTON WOULD CHOOSE RESTING FOR\nTWO DAYS OVER GOING TO LOUISIANA.\nBUT SHE DID. SO YOU MAY SEE A GROWING\nCONTRAST IN ENERGY LEVEL AS THE TRUMP PEOPLE THINK THIS IS THE\nSIGNIFICANT SUBLIMINAL ISSUE IN THE CAMPAIGN THAT HE HAS THE\nDRIVE, HE HAS THE ENERGY, HE HAS THE TOUGHNESS.\nHE CAN TAKE IT ON. HE BELIEVES SHE DOES NOT.\n>> AGAIN, I WANT TO ASK YOU THOUGH, DID YOU HAVE A DIRECT\nHAND IN GETTING HIM TO FOCUS ON TAKING HIS MESSAGE BEYOND THE\nRALLIES, TO ACTUALLY GO TO SOME OF THE HOT SPOTS IN OUR COUNTRY\nWHERE PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO SEE HOW HE REACTS TO THOSE\nSITUATIONS? >> OH, THESE DECISIONS ARE MADE\nBY A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE AROUND TRUMP IN THE AIRPLANE AND\nAT TRUMP TOWERS. THEY KNOW WHERE I STAND.\nWE ARE GOOD FRIENDS WITH VIRTUALLY ALL OF THEM.\nAND THEY KNOW FIRST OF ALL BECAUSE THEY WATCH ME ON YOUR\nSHOW AND THEY GET LOTS OF E-MAILS FROM ME.\nAND OCCASIONAL PHONE CALLS. BUT THEY'RE RUNNING THE\nCAMPAIGN. THEY'RE MAKING THE DAY-TO-DAY\nDECISIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN HE WAS IN\nMILWAUKEE, IN A MOMENT THAT HAD BEEN A REAL CRISIS FOR PEOPLE IN\nMILWAUKEE HE HAD TWO GREAT ADVISERS.\nSHERIFF CLARK, WHO IS A NATIONAL LEADER ON CRIME, AND HE HAD\nMAJOR GIULIANI, PROBABLY THE BEST MAJOR IN THE LAST 50 YEARS\nAT DEFEATING CRIME AND LOWERING THE MURDER RATE.\nWHAT A TEAM TO PUT TOGETHER TO GIVE THIS SPEECH TUESDAY NIGHT?\n>> I WANT TO GET YOUR REACTION TO THE DEPARTURE OF TRUMP'S\nCAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN PAUL MANAFORT JUST DAYS AFTER TEAM TRUMP\nANNOUNCED THE EXPANSION OF THE LEADERSHIP TEAM TO INCLUDE\nKELLYANNE CONWAY AND STEVE BANNON.\n>> I DO THINK TRUMP WANTED A VERY AGGRESSIVE FALL CAMPAIGN\nAND STEVE BANNON WHO HAS BEEN THE HEAD OF BREITBART AND\nKELLYANNE CONWAY WHO IS A TERRIFIC POLLSTER AND REALLY\nVERY KNOWLEDGEABLE POLITICAL OPERATIVE, HE'S GOT A TEAM THAT\nWILL, I THINK, ACCELERATE THE SPEED AND THE TEMPO IN THE\nDIRECTION THAT TRUMP WANTS TO GO IN.\n>> I WANTED TO GET YOUR REACTION TO THE NEWS ALSO THAT IF HILLARY\nCLINTON WINS THE ELECTION, THE CLINTON FOUNDATION WILL NO\nLONGER ACCEPT FOREIGN AND CORPORATE DONATIONS AND BILL\nCLINTON WOULD RESIGN FROM THE BOARD IN AN EFFORT TO HEAD OFF\nANY CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. SOME MIGHT ASK WHY DIDN'T THIS\nHAPPEN WHEN SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE?\n>> LOOK, THEY'RE NOW IN AN IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION.\nYOU'VE HAD DEMOCRATIC FORMER GOVERNOR ED RENDELL, FORMER\nDEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CHAIRMAN COME OUT FLATLY AND SAY THEY\nOUGHT TO CLOSE THE FOUNDATION. YOU HAD THE BOSTON GLOBE SAY\nTHEY SHOULD CLOSE THE FOUNDATION.\nTHIS HALF STEP IS AN ABSURDITY AND RAISES ALL THE QUESTIONS THE\nFOUR YEARS SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE BILL CLINTON RUNNING\nAROUND THE PLANET MAKING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OUT OF\nDICTATORSHIP, RUSSIAN BANKS, OUT OF VARIETY OF INVESTMENTS AND\nYOU HAVE TO SAY TO YOURSELF THAT THE SCANDAL OF THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION ON TOP OF THE SCANDAL OF THE E-MAILS MAY BE ENOUGH TO\nSINK HER CANDIDACY. >> AND ON THE SUBJECT OF THOSE\nE-MAILS, SHE'S NOW SAYING THAT IT WAS COLIN POWELL WHO GAVE HER\nADVICE TO HAVE A SEPARATE SERVER.\n>> WELL, YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF, YOU HAVE COLIN POWELL\nONE OF THE MOST RESPECTED MEMBERS OF THE AMERICAN\nMILITARY, SECRETARY OF STATE, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER,\nCHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS SHS AND YOU HAVE HILLARY CLINTON WHO\nHAS LIED ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE. NOW, IF THEY TAKE TWO DIFFERENT\nPOSITIONS, WHAT DON'T YOU MET SHE'S THE ONE THAT'S WRONG?\n90-1. >> OVERALL THE FALL OUT FOR YOU\nYOU THINK THIS IS CONTINUE TO BE DRIP, DRIP, DRIP AS WE HEAD TO\nTHE FALL IN TERMS OF THE REVELATIONS THAT WILL COME\nFORWARD FROM THE E-MAILS? >> I HAD A CHANCE YESTERDAY TO\nTAKE A TWO-HOUR BRIEFING ON AN OVERVIEW OF CLINTON WORLD.\nAND IT WAS SO STAGGERING. THERE'S SO MUCH STUFF COMING OUT\nIN SEPTEMBER, I DON'T THINK SHE'LL EVER GET OUT FROM UNDER\nIT. JUST CORRUPTION AFTER CORRUPTION\nAFTER CORRUPTION. ALMOST NONE HAS YET SEEN THE\nSURFACE. WHEN IT DOES I THINK HER\nCANDIDACY WILL DROWN. >> WOW, THAT'S A SOBERING\nPREDICTION INDEED FROM YOU, MR. SPEAKER.\nI KNOW YOU'VE BEEN ON THE RECORD SAYING YOU STILL REALLY BELIEVE\nTHAT DONALD TRUMP CAN WIN THIS. >> LOOK, IF SHE DROWNS SHE WINS.\nIF ALL OF THIS STUFF CRASHES IN ON HER AND SHE GETS BEAT, THE\nPERSON WHO GOING TO WIN IS",

IN 2014, GOT 30,000 PEOPLE WERE\nKILLED IN TERROR ATTACKS WORLDWIDE.\nTHE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE PERPETRATING THE VIOLENCE WERE\nMUSLIM. BUT AND THIS IS IMPORTANT, SO\nWERE THE VICTIMS. OF THE 30,000 DEAD, THE VAST,\nVAST MAJORITY WERE MUSLIMS, THAT'S CRUCIAL TO UNDERSTAND,\nBECAUSE IT SHEDS LIGHT ON THE QUESTION, WHY DO THEY HATE US?\nISLAMIC TERRORISTS DON'T JUST HATE AMERICA OR THE WEST, THEY\nHATE THE MODERN WORLD, AND THEY PARTICULARLY HATE TRYING TO LIVE\nIN THE MODERN WORLD. LET'S BE CLEAR.\nWHILE THE JIHADIS ARE FEW, THERE IS A LARGER CANCER WITHIN THE\nWORLD OF ISLAM, A CANCER OF EXTREMISM AND INTOLERANCE, MOST\nHAVE LAWS THAT RESTRICT THE FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION OR THE\nMAJORITY. ARE THESE THINGS INHERENT IN THE\nRELIGION? WHEN EXPERTS TRY TO EXPLAIN THAT\nIN THE 14th CENTURY ISLAMIC COUNTY -- THEY'RE NOT TRYING TO\nDENY THE REALTIES OF BACKWARDNESS TODAY, WHAT THEY'RE\nSAYING IS IT CAN CHANGE. ISLAM AFTER ALL HAS BEEN AROUND\nFOR 14 CENTURIES, THERE HAVE BEEN PERIODS OF WAR, BUT ALSO OF\nPEACE. IT'S THE SAME RELIGION THEN AND\nNOW, SO WHAT IS DIFFERENT? IT'S NOT THEOLOGY, IT'S\nPOLITICS. RADICAL ISLAM IS THE PRODUCT OF\nTHE BROKEN POLITICS AND STAGNANT ECONOMICS OF MUSLIM COUNTRIES.\nTHEY HAVE FOUND IN RADICAL RELIGIOUS AN IDEOLOGY THAT LETS\nTHEM RAIL AGAINST THE MODERN WORLD, AN IDEOLOGY THAT'S NOW\nBEING EXPORTED TO ALIENATED YOUNG MUSLIMS EVERYWHERE, IN\nEUROPE, EVEN IN SOME RARE CASES IN THE UNITED STATES.\nSO HOW TO END THIS? THERE'S REALLY ONLY ONE WAY.\nHELP THE MAJORITY OF MUSLIMS FIGHT EXTREMISTS, REFORM THEIR\nFAITH AND MODERNIZE THEIR SOCIETIES.\nIN DOING SO, WE SHOULD LISTEN TO THOSE ON THE FRONT LINES, MANY\nOF WHOM ARE FIGHTING AND DYING IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST JIHADIS,\nTHE HUNDREDS OF MUSLIM REFORMERS I HAVE SPOKEN TO SAY THEIR TASK\nIS MADE MUCH HARDER WHEN WESTERN POLITICIANS AND PUNDITS CONDEMN\nISLAM ENTIRELY, DEMEAN THEIR FAITH AND SPEAK OF ALL MUSLIMS\nAS BACKWARD AND SUSPECT. HERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO THINK\nABOUT THIS, IN AMERICA, AFRICAN-AMERICANS MAKE UP ABOUT\n13% OF THE POPULATION, YET THEY COMPRISE ABOUT 50% OF HOMICIDE\nOFFENDERS, ACCORDING TO A JUSTICE DEPARTMENT STUDY.\nNOW WE UNDERSTAND, I HOPE WE UNDERSTAND, THAT WHEN WE SEE A\nBLACK MAN ON THE STREET, WE CANNOT, MUST NOT TREAT HIM AS A\nLIKELY CRIMINAL, IT WOULD BE DEHUMANIZING, UNFAIR, AND\nRACIST. IN AMERICA OF ALL PLACES, PEOPLE\nSHOULD BE TREATED AS INDIVIDUALS AND NOT AS STEREOTYPES FROM A\nRACIAL, ETHNIC OR RELIGIOUS GROUP.\nREMEMBER, THE BANGLADESHI CAB DRIVER WHO DRIVES YOU TO THE\nAIRPORT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ISIS, EVEN THOUGH IT IS ALSO A\nMUSLIM. IT'S HARD NOT TO MAKE THESE\nQUICK ASSOCIATIONS, ESPECIALLY IN THE WAKE OF A TERROR ATTACK.\nBUT IF AMERICA IS ABOUT ANYTHING, IT IS THE IDEA THAT\nPEOPLE SHOULD BE JUDGED WITH INDIVIDUALS WITH INDIVIDUAL\nLIBERTIES AND RIGHTS, IT IS WHAT THEY HATE ABOUT US.\nWE MIGHT AS WELL LIVE UP TO OUR OWN IDEALS.\nI'M FAREED ZAKARIA, THANK YOU",

THERE WAS NEWS FROM TURKEY THAT\nRELEASED THEY RELEASED 30,000 CRIMINAL PRISONERS, TO MAKE ROOM\nFOR THE POLITICAL PRISONERS THAT HE IS ARRESTING.\nAND I THINK THE REPORTS OF POSSIBLY ALLOWING RUSSIAN PLANES\nTO USE THE BASE COMBINED WITH RUSSIAN PLANES USING AIR BASES\nIN IRAN TO ATTACK OPPONENTS OF THE ASSAD REGIME, ALL OF THIS\nPUT IN CONTEXT REFLECTS A DRAMATIC DEMOLITION OVER\nAMERICAN INFLUENCE, AND THE REGION AS A WHOLE.\nIT'S VERY DANGEROUS, AND BIDEN OUGHT TO BE HAVING A VERY\nSTRAIGHT CONVERSATION.

HE SAID WHEN HE WAS MAYOR OF\nISTANBUL, DEMOCRACY IS LIKE A STREETCAR.\nYOU DRIVE IT WHERE YOU WANT AND GET OFF.\nHE IS GETTING OFF. HE IS OUT OF NATO ALLIANCE, AND\nTHAT'S WHY BIDEN SHOULD NOT MINCE WORDS.\n>> WHAT WOULD IT MEAN IF RUSSIA LANDED AT THE BASE?\nWHAT WOULD THAT MEAN STRUCTURE AND STABILITY OF THE WESTERN\nWORLD AND DEPENDENCE ON THAT NATION?\n>> WE HAVE A CONFLICT WITH SYRIA AND IRAQ AGAINST ISIS, AND IN\nOTHER STRATEGIC REGIONS.

I KNOW THAT, YOU KNOW, MR.\nTRUMP'S REMARKS ARE CAUSING SOME CONTROVERSY AND SOME CIRCLES BY\nSAYING THAT THIS EXTREME VETTING IS STILL VERY AMBIGUOUS.\nTHAT IT MAY BE UNFAIRLY TARGETING PEOPLE, SPECIFICALLY\nMUSLIMS, HERE IN THIS COUNTRY.

HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT AND\nWHAT CAN BE DONE TO BRIDGE THAT GAP, TO GET MORE PEOPLE COMING\nTOGETHER, TO LOOK AT THIS IN A VERY REALISTIC WAY WITHOUT\nGENERATING MORE CONCERNS THAT THIS MAY BE RACIALLY BIASED?\n>> UMA, IT'S ABOUT TIME WE SEE MORE PATRIOTISM ON THE PART OF\nTHE MUSLIM COMMUNITY AND LESS TERRORISM.\nLET'S FACE IT, WE ARE A NATION RIGHT NOW IN A STATE OF ALARM.\nWE ARE A NATION AT A STATE OF FEAR.\nWHEN WE HAVE SAN BERNARDINO, WHEN WE HAVE ORLANDO, WHEN WE\nHAVE FT. HOOD, WHEN WE ARE WORRIED WALKING DOWN OUR STREETS\nTHAT A JIHADIST IS GOING TO WALK WITH A MACHETE AND START KILLING\nPEOPLE, WE ARE CONCERNED AS A NATION.\nTHIS IS A TIME TO THROW POLITICAL CORRECTNESS.\nWE HAVE A PROBLEM AND WE NEED TO IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM.\nAND RIGHT NOW THE TERRORISM IS NOT COMING FROM THE BUDDHIST\nCOMMUNITY. IT'S NOT COMING FROM THE\nCHRISTIAAN COMMUNITY. IT'S NOT COMING FROM THE JEWISH\nCOMMUNITY. IT IS COMING FROM THE ISLAMIC\nCOMMUNITY BECAUSE REGARDLESS OF WHO PERPETRATED THE ATTACK OR\nWHAT COUNTRY THEY CAME FROM, THE THING THEY HAVE ALL IN CHON IS\nTHEY ALL ADHERE TO THE ISLAMIC IDEOLOGY AND THAT IDEOLOGY IS\nWHAT TRUMP IS TALKING ABOUT AND WHY WE MUST ADDRESS IT AS A\nNATION. >> LET'S FOCUS FOR JUST A MOMENT\nON THE OTHER PART OF THE STORY THAT WE'RE ALSO FOCUSING ON\nABOUT THE CONCERNS OVER THE RELEASE OF THE GITMO DETAINEES.\nTHESE -- THIS LATEST RELEASE SIGNALS THE LARGEST GROUP THAT'S\nBEEN RELEASED SO FAR WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA PROMISING TO\nMAKE GOOD ON HIS ASSURANCES THAT HE WANTS TO CLOSE GITMO.\nTHESE FOLKS SENT TO THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE WAY THIS IS BEING HANDLED,\nPARTICULARLY WITH THE FACT THAT WE ARE SEEING AND HEARING MORE\nREPORTS THAT A NUMBER OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN RELEASED RETURN\nBACK TO THE BATTLEGROUND? >> EXACTLY.\nAND IT'S IRONIC THAT THIS WEEK IN PARTICULAR THE FORMER\nBODYGUARD OSAMA BIN LADEN WHICH WE HAD RELEASED IN 2012 AND HE\nOF COURSE IMMEDIATELY JOINED AL QAEDA, ARABIAN PENINSULA IN\n2014. THIS WEEK WROTE AN ARTICLE AND\nISSUED THE WARNING TO THE UNITED STATES SAYING WE ARE GOING TO\nATTACK YOU. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE JIHADISTS\nWHO ARE ENGLISH SPEAKING, WHO HAVE WESTERN NAMES, WHO ARE NOT\nON THE CIA, ON THE FBI LIST, WHO ARE GOING TO ATTACK YOU.\nAND HE CONTINUED SAYING THAT THESE PEOPLE MAY HAVE EVEN ZEFD\nIN YOUR OWN ARMY. THEY MAY HAVE DRANK ALCOHOL.\nTHEY MAY HAVE EATEN PORK IN THE PAST BUT THEY WILL BE ATTACKING\nYOU AND COMING FOR YOU. THIS IS HAPPENING THIS WEEK ON\nTHE HEEL OF OBAMA SAYING WE'RE GOING TO RELEASE MORE PEOPLE,\nSENDING THEM TO THE GULF. WE HAVE SEEN ALREADY THE WRITING\nON THE WALL. THIS IS NOT OPINION.\nWE ALREADY KNOW THAT A LOT OF THEM HAVE GONE BACK TO THE\nFIELD. THEY ARE RECRUITING.\nTHEY ARE TRAINING. AND BY THE WAY, WHEN THEY GO\nBACK THEY ARE TREATED AS A HEROES BECAUSE THEY ARE THE\nEXAMPLE OF WHAT A TRUE JIHADIST SHOULD BE ALL ABOUT AND THE\nYOUTH LOOKS UP TO THEM. THE YOUTH LOOK UP TO THEM.\nTHEY FOLLOW THEM. THEY ARE EVEN MORE DANGEROUS\nTHAN JUST SOME JIHADIST WHO DECIDES TO MAKE A NAME FOR\nHIMSELF. >> IT IS A BIG CONCERN BECAUSE\nWE ARE SEEING AND HEARING AS I MENTIONED, REPORTS OF SEVERAL OF\nTHESE INDIVIDUALS GOING BACK AND JOINING THE FIGHT IN -- FIGHT IN\nGETTING INVOLVED WITH TERRORISTS GROUPS EVEN AFTER YEARS OF BEING\nDETAINED HERE, AT GITMO BAY.

TRUMP'S PROPOSALS.\nFROM MY UNDERSTANDING, AN ADVISORY BOARD IS TO OFFERED A\nVICE, THAT THE CANDIDATE LISTENS TO THEIR ADVICE.\nSHOULDN'T THIS BE THE OTHER WAY AROUND, THAT HE LISTENS TO THEM\nINSTEAD OF SIMPLE TELLING THEM WHAT HE BELIEVES?\n>> ABSOLUTELY HE LISTENS TO THEM.\nI DON'T THINK WE NEED TO TRIP ON WORDS.\nTHE ENGAGEMENT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.\nHE'S GOING TO START DOING THIS MORE AND MORE WITH\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN LEADERS. HE'S REACHED OUT AND SAID LOOK\nAT THE ECONOMIC POLICIES THAT WE NOW HAVE.\nWE NEED JOBS IN OUR COMMUNITIES AROUND AMERICA.\nWE HAVE 94 MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE UNDEREMPLOYED OR UNEMPLOYED.\nWE HAVE 43 MILLION PEOPLE ON FOOD STAMPS.\nTHE HOUSEHOLD INCOME HAS FALLEN FROM $57,000 TO $53,000.\nWE HAVE THE LOWEST HOMEOWNERSHIP RATE IN THE LAST 50 YEARS.\nIF YOU WANT A THIRD TERM OF BARACK OBAMA, THEN YOU HAVE\nSOMEBODY WHO'S STANDING BY READY TO GIVE IT TO YOU.\nBUT IF YOU WANTED CHANGE AND YOU WANT SOMETHING DIFFERENT, THEN\nWE NEED TO ELECT AN OUTSIDER, SOMEBODY WHO'S NOT BOUGHT AND\nPAID FOR BY WALL STREET AND SPECIAL INTERESTS.\n>> SEEMS TO BE A BIT MORE DISCIPLINED HERE.\nSOME OF THOSE WILD TWEETS HAVE BEEN CURTAILED.\nHE'S NOW ON TELEPTELEPROMPTER. YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT SEEMS\nTO BE IN SOME WAY SOME DISCIPLINE FROM DONALD TRUMP?\n>> THIS ONE HITS HOME FOR ME BECAUSE HE HAS INSULTED\nIMMIGRANT FAMILIES LIKE MY OWN FAMILY.\nYOU CAN'T PUT THAT BACK IN A BOTTLE.\nYOU CAN'T MASK THAT WITH A TELEPROMPTER SPEECH.\nIT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MANY PEOPLE ADVISE HIM ON WHAT NOT TO\nSAY, WE ALREADY KNOW HOW HE FEELS.\nWE'VE HEARD ALL THE RACIST RANTS, THE SEXIST RANTS.\nI'M A SIXTH GRADE TEACHER FROM UTAH.\nANYONE OF MY KIDS SAYING HALF THE THINGS HE SAID THIS YEAR\nWOULD BE ON DETENTION FOR BULLYING.\nTHIS IS IMMATURE BEHAVIOR. IT'S UNACCEPTABLE.\nTHIS IS NOT ONLY A MAN THAT'S NOT QUALIFIED, HE'S NOT WORTHY\nTO BE PRESIDENT. I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT UP THE OUT\nREACH TO MINORITY COMMUNITIES. HE CANNOT FIX THE DAMAGE THAT\nHE'S DONE. IT'S WHY HE'S NOT GOING TO WIN\nAND IT'S WHY HE HAS TO GO ON THESE EXTRAORDINARY TRIPS TO GO\nTO PEOPLE AND SAY, I DIDN'T REALLY MEAN WHAT YOU HEARD ME\nSAY. YES, HE DID.\n>> THANK YOU BOTH. WE'LL CONTINUE THIS\nCONVERSATION. WHAT WE SAW AGAIN FOR A FOURTH\nCONSECUTIVE DAY, DONALD TRUMP ALSO REACHING OUT TO\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS. WE'LL TALK THINK ABOUT NEXT\nHOUR.",

FOR ONE THING, SHE DOESN'T HAVE\nTHE STRENGTH OR THE STAMINA, COUPLED WITH ALL OF THE OTHER\nPROBLEMS THAT THIS COUNTRY HAS, AND WE HAVE A LOT.\nYET AS OUR MILITARY WAS DEPLETED ON HILLARY CLINTON'S WATCH,\nTHINGS TURNED OUT REALLY WELL FOR HER AND ONLY HER.\n>> JOINING ME NOW, ANDRE BAUER, FORMER LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR OF\nSOUTH CAROLINA, A DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTER, AND HILARY ROSEN, A\nDEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST AND HILLARY CLINTON SUPPORTER.\nANDRE, WHY DOES HE KEEP GOING AFTER HILLARY CLINTON'S STAMINA?\nRIGHT WING MEDIA OUTLETS HAVE BEEN GOING AFTER QUESTIONS ABOUT\nHER HEALTH, SEEMING LIKE CONSPIRACY THEORIES.\nIS THAT EFFECTIVE? >> IT MAKES ONE QUESTION WHAT\nWAS SHE DOING THIS WEEKEND, WHAT WAS SHE DOING LAST WEEKEND, WHY\nDOESN'T SHE WANT TO TAKE QUESTIONS FROM THE MEDIA?\nI THINK THERE IS A QUESTION THERE THAT HE'S POINTING OUT, IS\nSHE UP FOR THE JOB. >> BUT HE'S TALKING ABOUT HER\nSTAMINA AND SORT OF HEALTH CAPACITY.\nDO YOU THINK THAT'S LEGITIMATE? >> I MEAN, WHEN YOU'RE 80 DAYS\nOUT FROM A CAMPAIGN AND YOU'RE THREE DAYS OFF THE TRAIL?\nI MEAN, THAT JUST SEEMS A LITTLE ODD.\nLAST WEEKEND, THE SAME THING. CLEARLY THE VOTERS HAVE A RIGHT\nTO KNOW WHETHER SHE'S PREPARED AND UP FOR THE CHALLENGE.\n>> HILLARY? >> OH, GOD.\nWELL, HILLARY CLINTON DOES MORE EV\nEVENTS, YOU KNOW, IN A WEEK THAN DONALD TRUMP HAS EVER DONE THIS\nENTIRE CAMPAIGN. HE DOES ONE EVENT A DAY.\nSHE DOES THREE AND FOUR EVENTS A DAY.\nTHE LAST THING VOTERS WILL EVER BELIEVE IS THAT HILLARY CLINTON\nWILL BE OUTWORKED. SHE WON'T BE OUTWORKED.\nWE OUGHT TO GO TO THE BIGGER PICTURE, THOUGH, OF THIS\nMESSAGE. YOU KNOW, I'M AMUSED IN WATCHING\nDONALD TRUMP NOW. THIS IS I THINK DAY THREE OF HIS\nCONSTANT TELEPROMPTER USE. HE DOESN'T REALLY SEEM ANY MORE\nCOMFORTABLE ON DAY THREE THAN HE DID AT THE OUTSET.\nBUT THIS IS CLEARLY AN ATTEMPT TO BE A LITTLE MORE DISCIPLINED\nAND MORE CONTROLLED. BUT IN MANY WAYS IT LOSES ALL OF\nTHE AUTHENTICITY THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS.\nSO HE GETS KIND OF THE WORST OF BOTH WORLDS.\nHE'S ON THIS TELEPROMPTER SAYING REALLY RIDICULOUS THINGS.\nSO HE'S NOT EVEN GETTING THE BENEFIT OF THEM SOUNDING\nOFF-THE-CUFF. HE'S ATTACKING HER STAMINA BUT\nIT'S ON THE TELEPROMPTER. SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT DONALD\nTRUMP WE'RE GETTING AT ANY ONE MOMENT HERE.\nBUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT THIS SORT OF DISJOINTED SPEECH IS NOT\nGOING TO BE EFFECTIVE. >> HOWEVER, HILARY ROSEN, EVEN\nAS A CLINTON SUPPORTER, DIDN'T THE MOMENT STRIKE YOU WHEN HE\nSAID, HE ADMITTED, IT WAS SORT OF THIS MOMENT OF CONTRITION, HE\nSAID WE AS A PARTY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nVOTERS, I KNOW WE HAVE TO DO BETTER.\nHE SAID, WILL AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS PLEASE HONOR ME WITH YOUR\nVOTE. >> YEAH, LOOK, I BELIEVE THAT IT\nIS A CRIME THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS SO ABANDONED PEOPLE OF\nCOLOR AND THE DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION MESSAGE.\nI DO THINK IT'S IRONIC THAT THE ENTIRE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION,\nWHICH WAS THE MOST INCLUSIVE AND DIVERSE CONVENTION WE'VE EVER\nSEEN, DONALD TRUMP MOCKED HILLARY FOR THAT VERY THING, AND\nTHEN HE GOES INTO AN AUDIENCE AND SAYS WE CARE ABOUT\nINCLUSION, WE CARE ABOUT REACHING OUT.\nI JUST DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO BE VERY CREDIBLE.\nYOU SHOULD GO ON BLACK TWITTER TODAY AND SEE HOW PEOPLE OF\nCOLOR ARE REACTING TO HIS SPEECH.\nHAVING SAID THAT, SHOULD REPUBLICANS BE MAKING POLICY\nPROPOSALS AND THINKING ABOUT HOW TO HELP PEOPLE OF COLOR?\nOF COURSE THEY SHOULD BE. AND, YOU KNOW, IT WILL REMAIN TO\nBE SEEN WHETHER THIS IS SUCCESSFUL.\nI DON'T THINK IT WILL BE. >> ANOTHER MOMENT THAT STOOD OUT\nTO ME WAS WHEN DONALD TRUMP TALKED ABOUT THE SECOND\nAMENDMENT. LET'S PLAY THIS.\n>> HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO ESSENTIALLY ABOLISH THE SECOND\nAMENDMENT FOR LAW ABIDING AMERICANS.\nSHE WANTS TO OVERTURN THE SUPREME COURT RULING THAT\nAFFIRMED THE SECOND AMENDMENT AS A PRIVATE RIGHT SO THAT ANY CITY\nOR STATE IN THIS COUNTRY CAN BAN PRIVATE GUN OWNERSHIP.\n>> ANDRE, THAT'S JUST FACTUALLY INACCURATE TO SAY.\nAND I KNOW IT PLAYS WELL WITH HIS SUPPORTERS, WE'VE HEARD THEM\nCHEER AFTERWARDS. I JUST WONDER, AS A FORMER\nLAWMAKER YOURSELF AND A TRUMP SUPPORTER, DO YOU THINK THAT\nSAYING THINGS LIKE THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN, THAT SHE WANTS TO\nABOLISH THE SECOND AMENDMENT, WHICH IS JUST NOT TRUE, IS A\nSMART LONG TERM PLAY? >> SHE SAID SHE FAVORS A BUYBACK\nPROGRAM. SHE SAID SHE FAVORS THE\nAUSTRALIAN SYSTEM. SO SHE HAS GIVEN SOME INDICATION\nTHAT SHE WOULD LIKE TO SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE THE AMOUNT\nOF GUNS IN THIS COUNTRY. >> THAT IS NOT ABOLISHING THE\nSECOND AMENDMENT THOUGH. SO SAY IT THAT WAY, RIGHT?\n>> YOU LOOK AT IT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, IF YOU'RE TRYING TO\nENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GIVE THEIR GUNS BACK, THAT'S DOING A LOT TO\nDO AWAY WITH THE SECOND AMENDMENT.\nI'M SORRY, GO AHEAD. >> COME ON, ANDRE, YOU KNOW\nTHAT'S NOT TRUE. YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST RHETORIC.\nSHE'S NOT FOR THAT. SHE'S WHERE 90% OF THE COUNTRY\nIS IN TERMS OF BACKGROUND CHECKS AND THE LIKE.\n>> THEN I DON'T RUN INTO THE OTHER 10%, THE ONLY 10% THAT\nWANT TO SELL THEIR GUNS BACK TO THE GOVERNMENT.\nAS A TAXPAYER, I DON'T WANT TO BUY THE GUNS BACK.\nI THINK LAW ABIDING CITIZENS OUGHT TO OWN A FIREARM, THEY\nOUGHT TO OWN SEVERAL. THAT KEEPS THE PEACE IN A LOT OF\nNEIGHBORHOODS. QUITE FRANKLY, TO CONTINUE, YOU\nKNOW, NOT TO SHOW UP, NOT TO HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS\nDRESSED IN LAW ENFORCEMENT UNIFORMS AT THE CONVENTION, I\nMEAN, IT SEEMS KIND OF ODD TO ME, IT'S ALMOST LIKE SHE'S RUN\nAWAY FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND SO I DON'T THINK SHE CAN ASK\nFOR THE FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE ENDORSEMENT THIS YEAR,\nWHICH IS ODD IN ITSELF. SHE'S DEFINITELY GIVEN SOME\nINDICATION THAT SHE DOESN'T WANT TO BE NEAR LAW AND ORDER.\n>> HILLARY, 30-SECOND RESPONSE, THEN WE'VE GOT TO GO.\n>> IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER TRUMP IS CONSISTENTLY LYING,\nFOUR-PINOCCHIO FACT CHECKER, WHICH HE SAYS THINGS LIKE\nHILLARY WANTS TO TAKE AWAY THE SECOND AMENDMENT.\nIT MAKES HIM LOOK BAD. IN A DEBATE SITUATION, WHEN HE\nCAN'T BACK UP THESE CHARGES WITH REAL FACTS, HE WILL BE BACK ON\nHIS HEELS. HE'S GOT TO BE IN A SITUATION\nWHERE HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\nHE SEEMS INCAPABLE OF THAT. >> ANDRE BAUER, HILARY ROSEN,\nTHANKS SO MUCH.",

IF YOU DRILL DOWN INTO ACTUAL\nISSUES, ALL THE VARIOUS WEBSITES AND POLICIES, YOU WILL SEE\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS VARIOUS ADVANCEmS IN SCHOOLS, WE SEE THE\nLABOR PARTICIPATION RATE WHICH IS UNDER 63% ANOTHER 10 MILLION,\n12 MILLION THE PAST SELF YEARS LEFT THE LABOR MARKETS.\nPEOPLE WANT TO GET MORE TRAINING.\nTHE SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY IN DEMAND.\nTHEY HAVE A HIGHER SKILLED LABOR MARK.\n>> THAT WILL CAUSE RATES TO DECLINE.\n>> THAT MIGHT PUT A FEW HUNDRED FOLKS TO WORK.\nI WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE RHETORIC FROM BOTH SIDE,\nACTUALLY. >> IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT\nIS DONE, IT'S WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT.\nTAMMY, YOU COVER THESE ISSUES, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS,\nTRUMP'S SUPPORTERS WILL SAY, LOOK THE POST RATE HAS GONE UP.\nIT HAS. 2008, 13% OF AMERICANS IN POST.\n15% IS DOWN A LITTLE BIT. THAT'S THE WRONG NUMBER.\n15% IS DOWN FROM WHERE IT WAS AT THE HEIGHT OF THE GREAT\nRECESSION. BUT WHAT POLICY PRESCRIPTION\nDOES IT APPEAR WOULD HELP THE POOREST MOST?\n>> I MEAN CERTAINLY BOTH OF THE CANDIDATES ARE TALKING ABOUT\nTHAT. BUT IT'S INTERESTING ARTHUR\nBROOKS CAME OUT WITH A BOOK LAST YEAR TALKING ABOUT HOW\nREPUBLICANS NEED TO RETHINK AND REVIRGINIA THEIR PRESCRIPTIONS\nFOR THE POOR. UP WITH OF THE THINGS THAT THEY\nREALLY WANT TO DO IS FOCUS ON HELPING YOUNG SINGLE MEN RISE\nOUT OF POVERTY. A LOTLE OF PROBLEMS TAKE CARE OF\nCHILDREN. WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF HELPING\nPEOPLE RETURN TO THE LABOR FORCE.\nHE NEEDS ASSISTANCE TO RETURN. >> IT'S INTERESTING.\nBOTH CANDIDATES TALK SO MUCH ABOUT BRINGING MANUFACTURING\nJOBS BACK. IT'S IMPORTANT.\nTHEY GO ALONG THE RUST BELT. THEY ACCOUNT FOR LESS THAN 10%\nIN THE ECONOMY. SO TALKING ABOUT THE WRONG\nTHINGS IN TERMS OF THE MASSS? >> CERTAINLY, A LOT OF EXPERTS\nSAY YOU WILL NEVER BY MANUFACTURING JOBS BACK.\nTHOSE ARE CANDIDATES, PARTICULARLY DONALD TRUMP'S\nPRESCRIPTION FOR HELPING THE WORKING CLASS.\nBUT MANY OF THE POOR WERE NEVER WORKING IN MANUFACTURING TO\nBEGIN WITH. THERE WAS A SLIDE THAT WE SAW\nEARLIER THAT ONLY 32% OR SO OF THE POOR WORK.\n>> CAN WE PULL THAT UP SO PEOPLE GET A SENSE OF THE NUMBERS?\n>> FEWER THAN 10% WORK FULL TIME.\nSO JUST BRINGING JOBS BACK IS NOT GOING TO HELP THE POOR.\n>> JULIEN, OVER TO YOU, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE POLITICS IN TERMS\nOF GETTING THE VOTES. THERE IS A REASON WHY\nCANDIDATES, NOT JUST THESE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES, MANY\nTALK MORE TO THE MIDDLE CLASS THAN TO THE POOR IN TERMS OF WHO\nCOMES OUT TO VOTE? >> DEMOCRATS ARE OFTEN LEERY\nABOUT TALKING POST PROGRAMS DIRECTLY BECAUSE THEY FEAR TOO\nLEFT CENTER. THE POOR DON'T VOTE IN THE\nMIDDLE CLASS, I WOULD SAY, THAT THE DEMOCRATS DO HAVE MORE\nPOLICIES USUALLY AND A CAMPAIGN THAT ADDRESSED POVERTY.\nSO AFFORDABLE HOUSING HAS BEEN A PART OF THE CHECKPOINT CAMPAIGN\nTHE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS A PROGRAM THAT DEALS WITH THE\nPOOR, FOR REPUBLICANS, THERE HAS BEEN SOME MORE TALK IN RECENT\nYEARS WITH PAUL RYAN INTRODUCING A PLAN.\n>> RYAN CAME OUT AND HE TALKED ABOUT GOING INTO THE POOREST\nNEIGHBORHOODS IF AMERICA AND HE SAID I REALIZED I WAS WRONG WHEN\nHE TALKED ABOUT MAKERS AND TAKERS, HE SAYS TAKERS WASN'T\nHOW TO RESPOND TO A SINGLE MOM STUCK IN A POST TRAP.\nMOST PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO BE DEPENDENT.\nSO I THINK THERE HAS BEEN AN EVOLUTION AMONG THE LANGUAGE\nUSED AND THE OUTLOOK, TAMMY, FOR POLITICIAN ON BOTH SIDES.\n>> CERTAINLY, I THINK THERE WAS ANNEST TO BE COMPASSIONATE\nCONSERVATIVE. THE POLITICAL SEASON IF YOU ARE\nNOT FOCUSING ON MAJOR POLICIES OR THE RHETORIC.\n>> RYAN'S POLICIES ARE AT ODDS WITH THE POLICIES NECESSARY TO\nDEAL -- >> DID ANYONE SAY THEY'RE AT\nODDS TO SUPPORT AMERICANS? >> I THINK IN GENERAL THE PARTY\nHAS MOVED VERY RIGHTWARD IN THE LAST FEW DECADES, ESPECIALLY\nSINCE 2010. WHILE THERE MIGHT BE RHETORICAL\nSYMPATHY FOR THE POOR, THERE HASN'T BEEN MUCH ON THE TABLE.\nTHE OPPOSITION OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.\nIT'S BEEN CENTRAL. >> MORE REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS\nINITIALLY SAID, OH NOT IN MY STATE.\nNOW THEY'RE COMING IN. SO WE STILL NEED MORE PEOPLE.\n>> FINAL THOUGHT TO YOU, POLITICS ASIDE THE PEOPLE YOU\nWORK WITH EVERY DAY THE POOREST AMERICANS, WHAT IS THE NUMBER\nONE THING THEY NEED OUT OF THE ADMINISTRATION?\n>> BOTTOM LINE IS 70% OF CONSUMER SPENDING OF GDP IS\nCONSUMER SPENDING. WE WILL HAVE INDIVIDUALS TO HELP\nTHEM, ITS TIME FOR US ON WAITING FOR A SHIP TO COME IN.\nWE HAVE LEARN HOW TO CREATE OUR OWN SHIPS, SMALL BUSINESS\nDEVELOPMENT, ENFREE (NEWERSHIP, INDIVIDUALS SITTING BACK, I'M IN\nDETROIT RIGHT NOW, THEY HAVE A LOT OF INDIVIDUAL OUT HERE FIRED\nFROM JOBS NO LONGER AVAILABLE ON THE LINE.\nNOW THAT THOSE JOBS IN ENGINEERING THAT CREATE THE\nROBOTS THAT REPLACE THEM, AS AN ENGINEER ON THE EMPLOYMENT RATE,\nI'M ALMOST ZERO PERCENT.

KEVIN, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.\nI WANT TO PLAY SOMETHING FOR YOU.\nRUDY GIULIANI WHO HAS BEEN ON THE STUMP QUITE A BIT WAS ON FOX\nNEWS SUNDAY AND HE WAS SAYING THAT THE CHANGE OF TONE IS\nREALLY A REFOCUS. HE WANT YOU TO LISTEN AND GET\nYOUR REACTION. >> DONALD TRUMP IS EXTREMELY\nFOCUSED NOW. IF YOU LOOK AT HIS ENTIRE WEEK,\nYOU CAN SEE IT WAS FOCUSED ON ISSUES.\nHARD ISSUES. TOUGH ISSUES.\nISSUES ON WHICH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AGREE WITH HIM AND WITH\nUS. MAYBE 60, 65%.\n65 TO 70% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BELIEVE THE COUNTRY IS GOING IN\nTHE WRONG DIRECTION. AND IF HE CAN CONVINCE THEM THAT\nHE IS THE PERSON TO LEAD US, THEN CERTAINLY, HE IS THE ONLY\nONE TO GIVE US CHANGE. >> GIVE US CHANGE.\nSO HE IS REFOCUSED, IS IT GOING TO STICK AND DO YOU ATTRIBUTE TO\nTHE CAMPAIGN SHAKE-UP THIS WEEK? >> IT WAS A GOOD WEEK FOR DONALD\nTRUMP. LET'S START WITH THAT.\nBRINGING IN KELLYANNE CONWAY SEEMS TO HAVE A GOOD EFFECT ON\nTHE CAMPAIGN SO FAR. DOES HE HAVE THE TEMPERAMENT TO\nBE COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND WHETHER THEY'VE MADE UP THEIR\nMIND REMAINS TO BE DETERMINED IN THE POLLING THAT WILL COME OUT\nIN THE NEXT WEEK OR TWO. IF HE CAN STICK TO THIS.\nTHAT'S THE BIGGEST QUESTION WE ALWAYS HAVE WITH DONALD TRUM\nCAN HE STICK TO A MESSAGE AND NOT CREATE THE UNNECESSARY DRAMA\nHE HAS BEEN SUSCEPTIBLE TO. >> WE'VE HAD SO MANY COME ON THE\nSHOW AND SAY ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS.\nYOU SPOKE WITH ABOUT KELLYANNE CONWAY AND SHE PAIRED THIS\nMORNING ON CNN, AND SHE SAID LISTEN, IT IS TBD WHETHER DONALD\nTRUMP WILL MAKE THE CALL WHETHER HE WANTS TO DEPORT UP 11 MILLION\nUNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS OUT OF THE UNITED STATES IF HE BECOMES\nPRESIDENT. WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO THAT?\nDO YOU FEEL IF IT IS NOT JUST WORDS NOW, IF HE IS CHANGING THE\nACTIONS AND WILL PEOPLING RECEPTIVE TO THAT.\n>> I DON'T THINK IT WILL HURT HIM WITH HIS SUPPORTERS AND\nCOULD POSSIBLY SIGNAL A CHANGE FOR THE CAMPAIGN.\nI THINK, LOOK, THEY'RE GOING TO JUST SAY HIS SUPPORTER ALSO SAY\nIT IS A NEGOTIATING POSITION HE WAS STARTING FROM.\nEVERYTHING THAT HE HAS PROMISED THAT SUNDAYS GRANDIOSE AND\nCRAZY, ALE JUST SAY IT WAS A NEGOTIATING POSITION AND STILL\nGET THE WALL AND SOME OTHER IMMIGRATION CHANGES.\nSO HE IS NOT -- HE IS IN A BETTER POSITION DOING THIS, I\nTHINK, THAN NOTHING DOING IT. IT IS STILL AN OPEN QUESTION\nWHETHER IT WILL WORK. >> I WANT TO GET YOUR REACTION\nABOUT SOMETHING. WE TALKED ABOUT HIM REACHING OUT\nTO MINORITY GROUPS, THE STANCE WE HEARD FROM KELLYANNE CONWAY\nIN REGARDS TO THE PROBABLY NOT DEPORTATION OF 11 MILLION\nUNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. WHAT ABOUT HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH\nTHE RNC AND SOME OF THE GOP LEADERS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN REALLY\nRECEPTIVE TO HIM RUNNING. DO YOU THINK THEY'LL BE SHIFTING\nNOW WITH SOME OF THE TONE SHIFT THAT WE'VE SEEN?\n>> WELL, THE RNC HAS BEEN FULLY BEHIND HIM, MOST OF THE HOUSE\nAND SENATE SAID THEY'LL BACK HIM.\nTHERE HAS BEEN A FEW EXCEPTIONS. THERE ISN'T A MASS GROUP OF\nELECTED OFFICIALS IN THE RNC THAT HAVE DEFECTED FROM\nBUT IN THE PERCENTAGES OF REPUBLICANS, HE STILL HAS A\nPROBLEM, DOING WORST WITH REPUBLICANS THAN HILLARY CLINTON\nIS DOING WITH DEMOCRATS, AND HE NEEDS TO GET THEM BACK.\nWE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY'LL COME HOME.\n>> HOW DOES HE PLEASE BOTH SIDES?\nHE HAS A LOT OF WORK TO DO ON BOTH SIDES, EVEN IN THE GROUP\nTHAT WE DIDN'T THINK HE WOULD REALLY HAVE TO PLEASE AT THIS\nPOINT? >> WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE\nKELLYANNE CONWAY KIND OF HAS THAT SOLVED FOR THE MOMENT.\nIT ALMOST, YOU KNOW, YOU COULD HEAR KIND OF A CORE MESSAGE THAT\nHE HAS HAD. BUT IT WAS SOFTER IN SOME WAYS.\nYOU KNOW, IF HE CAN STICK TO IT, YOU KNOW, WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO\nSEE SOME SORT OF MOVEMENT OF REPUBLICANS BACK TO DONALD TRUMP\nAND YOU KNOW, SOME INDEPENDENTS WHO WANT TO GIVE HIM ANOTHER\nLOOK. HILLARY CLINTON HAD A TERRIBLE\nWEEK AGAIN THIS WEEK, AND SHE -- THE ADMINISTRATION CHANGED THE\nDEFINITION OF, YOU KNOW, THE WORD RANSOM, AND THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION IS STILL GOING TO TAKE FOREIGN DONATIONS AND\nCORPORATE MONEY UP UNTIL INAUGURATION DAY.\nPEOPLE DEFINITELY HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON.\n>> YEAH, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING HE HAS MATERIAL TO WORK\nWITH.

I THINK ONE OF THE SMARTEST\nMEMBERS OF THE SENATE. THAT WILL BE INTERESTING.\n>> ANYTIME A SENATOR WALKS IN HERE --\n>> ALL RISE. >> WE GET A LITTLE MORE STUDIOUS\nOR. OUR POSTURE GETS BETTER.\n>> WE CLEAN UP THINGS AROUND HERE.\nWE WANTED TO GET RIGHT TO THIS FOX NEWS ALERT.\nWE BEGIN AN APPARENT TERROR ATTACK TARGETING A WEDDING IN  .\nAT LEAST 50 PEOPLE ARE DEAD AND IF ISIS IS, INDEED, RESPONSIBLE,\nIT WOULD BE THE DEADLIEST EXTREMIST ATTACK IN 2016.\n>> WE'RE LIVE IN WASHINGTON WITH THE LATEST ON THIS UNFOLDING\nSTORY. GOOD MORNING LEYLAND.\n>> GOOD MORNING. THIS ATTACK REALLY HIGHLIGHTS\nTHE DANGER AND INSTABILITY RIGHT NOW INSIDE OF TURKEY.\nYOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE BOMBING SCENE THAT STRUCK OVERNIGHT.\nTHIS WAS A WEDDING THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SOMETHING THAT\nWAS ALL SO HAPPY AND TURNED ALL SO TRAGIC.\nWHERE THIS OCCURRED IS AWFULLY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT\nIT, RIGHT ON THE SYRIAN BORDER. A PLACE THAT HAD BEEN USED BY\nEXTREMISTS AND BY WANNABE TERRORISTS ALL THE TIME TO GO\nBACK AND FORTH IN AND OUT OF TURKEY.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE RIGHT NOW ARE SAYING THAT WHAT TURKEY ALLOWED\nFOR SO MANY YEARS IN THE RISE OF ISIS AND TURNING A BLIND EYE TO\nISIS, WELL, NOW THAT IS WHAT IS COMING BACK INTO THEIR COUNTRY.\nISIS HASN'T CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY, BUT ALL SIGNS\nPOINT TO THAT TERROR GROUP. REMEMBER, IT WAS JUST LAST MONTH\nINSIDE TURKEY THAT THE MILITARY ATTEMPTED A COUP, TRIED TO TAKE\nOVER THE COUNTRY FROM THE PRESIDENT SAYING IT HAD BECOME\nTOO ISLAMIC. THAT COUP FAILED AND NOW MANY\nARE SAYING THE INSTABILITY INSIDE TURKEY IS WHAT IS\nALLOWING ATTACKS LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN.\nGUYS, BACK TO YOU. >> I HATE WE KEEP HAVING TO\nREPORT ON THESE TYPE OF STORIES. THANK YOU SO MUCH.\n>> WE WANT TO GET IT OVER TO TUCKER CARLSON WITH SENATOR JEFF\nSESSIONS. >> WE HAVE A LOT GOING ON.\nWE THOUGHT WHAT BETTER PERSON TO RESPOND TO A LOT OF IT THAN\nSENATOR JEFF SESSIONS OF ALABAMA.\nGREAT TO SEE YOU THIS MORNING. >> THANK YOU, TUCKER.\n>> YOU JUST SAW THE TAPE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN TURKEY.\nTURKEY HAS BEEN A MODERATE, PRETTY RELIABLE U.S. ALLY FOR A\nLONG TIME. ARE YOU WORRIED THINGS ARE\nMOVING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION? >> WELL, TURKEY DOES SEEM TO BE\nSLIDING TO A MORE ISLAMIST IDEOLOGY AND THAT'S VERY\nDANGEROUS AND I HOPE IT DOESN'T CONTINUE.\nTHIS ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO ANYTHING TO STOP THAT\nSLIDE, SO IT CAUSES A PROBLEM. THEY DO HAVE THREATS LIKE YOU\nSEE IN THESE BOMBINGS, AND TURKEY HAS BEEN A GREAT ALLY.\nHAVING TURKEY MOVE IN THE WRONG DIRECTION IS REALLY PROBLEMATIC,\nAND WE NEED TO CONTINUE THAT GOOD RELATIONSHIP WE'VE HAD FOR\nMANY DECADES. >> YEAH, THAT WOULD BE A\nMASSIVE, MASSIVE PROBLEM FOR THE UNITED STATES.\nSO BUZZ FEED, WHICH IS A FASHION BLOG THAT HAS A NEWS COMPONENT\nTO IT, HAD A HEADLINE THIS MORNING SAYING IN EFFECT, DONALD\nTRUMP HAS CHANGED COURSE COMPLETELY ON IMMIGRATION.\nHE'S NO LONGER FOR DEPORTATION. IT WAS A STORY ABOUT A MEETING\nHE HAD THE OTHER DAY WITH HISPANIC SUPPORTERS.\nIS THAT TRUE? HAS HE CHANGED HIS VIEW ON\nDEPORTATION? >> HE'S NOT CHANGED HIS VIEW,\nBUT HE HAD A GREAT MEETING WITH PEOPLE WHO HAD DIFFERENT IDEAS\nAND I WASN'T THERE, BUT HE HAD A GOOD DISCUSSION.\nHE LISTENED TO ALL THE DIFFERENT VIEWS.\nLOOK, WE NEED A LAWFUL SYSTEM OF IMMIGRATION.\nTRUMP IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR AND CORRECT ON THAT.\nWE MUST END THE LAWLESSNESS FIRST.\nWE CAN'T TALK ABOUT THESE OTHER ISSUES UNTIL THAT OCCURS.\nI THINK THAT REMAINS HIS FIRM POSITION.\n>> SO THAT ANYWHERE BETWEEN 10 TO 12 MILLION PEOPLE HERE\nILLEGALLY, WHATEVER THE NUMBER. TRUMP HAS SUGGESTED THEY WOULD\nBE REQUIRED TO PHYSICALLY LEAVE THE UNITED STATES, REAPPLY IN\nORDER TO COME BACK LEGALLY. IS THAT --\n>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW THAT HE'S FORMALLY SAID THAT.\nHE DISCUSSED THAT. >> YES.\n>> OTHER PEOPLE HAVE DISCUSSED THAT.\nTHAT'S THE TOUCHBACK IDEA. >> YES.\n>> I'M NOT SURE THAT'S THE BEST SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM, BUT\nIT'S ONE SOLUTION. >> WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE BEST\nSOLUTION? >> WELL, I THINK WE HAVE TO\nFIRST END ALL THE LAWLESSNESS. THIS CAN BE DONE, TUCKER.\nIT'S VERY ACCOMPLISHABLE WITH A STRONG PRESIDENT.\nWE NEED A FEW LAWS WOULD HELP, BUT ACTUALLY YOU COULD DO IT\nWITH CURRENT LAWS. AND THAT'S -- THEN YOU BEGIN TO\nTALK MORE APPROPRIATELY ABOUT WHAT TO DO WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE\nBEEN HERE A LONG TIME. >> SO WHAT ABOUT LEGAL\nIMMIGRATION? WE'VE GOT OVER A MILLION\nLOW-WAGE, LOW-SKILLED WORKERS COMING IN EVERY YEAR INTO AN\nECONOMY THAT CLEARLY CAN'T SUPPORT THEM.\nWOULD TRUMP CHANGE THAT? >> WE'VE GOT TO CONSIDER THAT. CANADA HAS A GREAT SYSTEM WHERE\nTHEY EVALUATE PEOPLE, THEY RATE THEM, THEY GIVE THEM POINTS FOR\nTHINGS THAT ARE GOOD FOR CANADA. AN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM SHOULD\nMEET THE INTERESTS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\nWE NEED TO BRING IN PEOPLE WITH HIGHER SKILLS.\nWE SHOULD LOOK FOR PEOPLE WHO LOVE AMERICA AND VALUE OUR\nVALUES AND WANT TO BE A PART OF THAT, PEOPLE WHO LEARNED ENGLISH\nBEFORE THEY COME SHOULD GET A PREFERENCE OVER PEOPLE WHO CAN'T\nSPEAK THE LANGUAGE. THERE ARE SO MANY RATIONAL\nTHINGS THAT ABSOLUTELY NEED TO BE DONE AS PART OF AN\nIMMIGRATION REFORM THAT I TOTALLY THINK THIS COUNTRY IS\nREADY TO DISCUSS. >> IF YOU RAN YOUR OFFICE OR\nYOUR COMPANY THE WAY WE RUN OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM, JUST LIKE\nGIVING THE FIRST 100 SLOTS TO THE FIRST 100 PEOPLE WHO SHOWED\nUP, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO YOUR COMPANY?\n>> IT JUST MAKES NO SENSE. IT ABSOLUTELY MAKES NO SENSE.\nWE'VE GOT TO FIX THIS. WE CAN DO IT.\nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL SUPPORT IT, BUT WE HAVE POLITICIANS,\nPARTICULARLY DEMOCRATIC LEADERS AND HILLARY CLINTON THAT THEY\nWANT TO GIVE IMMEDIATE AMNESTY TO EVERYBODY, ALLOW THEM ACCESS\nTO EVERY BENEFIT IN AMERICA, AND THEN THEY DON'T WANT TO DO THE\nTHINGS NECESSARY TO GAIN CONTROL OF IMMIGRATION.\nSO THIS IS THE SITUATION THAT'S UNTENABLE.\nIT'S EXTREME. SHE'S TO THE LEFT OF PRESIDENT\nOBAMA. >> BIG TIME.\n>> BIG TIME. IT'S JUST AMAZING REALLY.\n>> SO I LOOK AT THE POLLS EVERY DAY OF THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE,\nGETTING PRETTY CLOSE TO ELECTION DAY REALLY, AND IT LOOKS BAD FOR\nDONALD TRUMP, AND YET I HEAR A LOT OF HIS SUPPORTERS SAY THOSE\nPOLLS AREN'T REAL. ARE THEY REAL?\nIS THERE AN APPRECIATION WITHIN THE CAMPAIGN THAT IT'S NOT ON\nTHE RIGHT COURSE AT PRESENT? >> WELL, POLLS ARE DIFFERENT.\n\"THE LOS ANGELES TIMES\" POLL HAS HIM UP NATIONWIDE.\nTHIS IS A CLOSE RACE RIGHT NOW. WHEN I RAN FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL\nIN ALABAMA THE FIRST TIME I WAS DOWN 14 POINTS IN SEPTEMBER AND\nWON BY 17. PRESIDENT BUSH IN 1988 WAS DOWN\n15 POINTS AT THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION AND WON\nOVERWHELMINGLY, EVERY STATE BUT MASSACHUSETTS AGAINST DUKAKIS.\nSO THIS IS SO FAR TO GO. DONALD TRUMP IS JUST NOW\nBEGINNING TO DRIVE HIS MESSAGE WITH THESE GREAT SPEECHES.\nHE'S SHOWING PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP AND THE FLOOD VICTIMS\nIN LOUISIANA. I THINK THIS CAMPAIGN IS JUST\nBEGINNING TO TAKE OFF. DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO WIN\nTHIS ELECTION. >> SO WHAT'S HIS PITCH TO BLACK\nVOTERS IF YOU COULD BOIL IT DOWN?\n>> THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. HE'S SAYING THAT THE AGENDA\nWE'VE SEEN IN THE BIG CITIES AND OUT OF WASHINGTON FOR THE LAST\n30 YEARS HAVE NOT HELPED YOU, WHICH IS CORRECT.\nTHEY HAVE NOT. YOU BRING IN MORE WORKERS THAN\nWE HAVE JOBS FOR, WHAT DOES THAT DO TO WAGES AND JOB PROSPECTS\nFOR STRUGGLING AFRICAN-AMERICANS WHO WOULD LIKE TO RISE?\nI MEAN, YOU JUST PULLED DOWN WAGES AND YOU PULL DOWN JOBS,\nAND WHEN YOU DO A TRADE POLICY, TUCKER, THAT KILLS\nMANUFACTURING, ELIMINATES HIGH-PAYING JOBS, THAT HURTS OUR\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND HISPANIC COMMUNITIES TOO.\nWE NEED A LEADER THAT CAN CHANGE THIS ECONOMY, GET US ON THE\nRIGHT PATH, END LAWLESSNESS AND IMMIGRATION, FIX OUR TRADE\nPOLICY SO THAT WE CAN HAVE STRONGER MANUFACTURING BASE AND\nBETTER JOBS. THAT WILL BE THE BEST THING\nPOSSIBLE FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS --\n>> BUT HAS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY BEEN PRETTY GOOD THAT CONVINCING\nBLACK VOTERS ALL NONWHITE VOTERS ARE IN THIS TOGETHER.\nTHAT THEY'RE ON THE SAME TEAM SOMEHOW?\n>> IT IS SORT OF AMAZING. IN MY VIEW WE HAVE AS GOVERNMENT\nLEADERS AN ABSOLUTE RESPONSIBILITY TO THE PEOPLE WHO\nARE HERE LAWFULLY IMMIGRATED OR BORN, NATIVE BORN.\nTHAT'S THE FIRST THING. THE IDEA THAT YOU WOULD BRING IN\nMORE WORKERS TO TAKE JOBS WHILE AMERICANS ARE UNEMPLOYED HAVING\nTO GO ON WELFARE IS LUDICROUS. IT MAKES NO SENSE, TUCKER, AND I\nTHINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE GET IT BUT THAT'S --\n>> WHAT'S THE REASON FOR IT? >> THAT'S THE POLICY OF THE\nOBAMA AND CLINTON ADMINISTRATION.\n>> I BET IF YOU POLLED A THOUSAND PEOPLE AND ASKED SHOULD\nWE BRING IN MORE WORKERS THAN WE ARE CREATING JOBS OR WHILE\nAMERICANS ARE UNEMPLOYED, THEY WOULD SAY NO, AND YET IT\nPERSISTS. THAT'S OUR OFFICIAL POLICY.\nWHAT'S THE MOTIVE BEHIND IT? >> THERE'S SEVERAL MOTIVES.\nFIRST, THERE'S A DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL AGENDA AT WORK AND\nTHEN THERE'S A BUSINESS AGENDA AT WORK HERE.\nBUSINESSES WANT MORE WORKERS AT LOWER WAGES.\nTHAT'S WHAT THEY DO. I MEAN, THAT'S THE NATURE OF\nTHEIR BEAST. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT POLITICIANS\nSHOULD LOOK AT. IF YOU'RE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT\nOF THE UNITED STATES, YOU WANT WAGES TO GO UP, NOT DOWN.\nGIVE ME A BREAK. BUSINESSES WOULD LIKE TO SEE\nMORE WORKERS IN LOWER WAGES. THAT'S JUST THE NATURE OF THE\nBEAST. >> DONALD TRUMP ARTICULATED THAT\nCLEARLY, I THINK HE'D WIN 55%, JUST MY GUESS.\nSENATOR SESSIONS, GREAT TO SEE YOU THIS MORNING.\nTHANKS FOR DOING THIS. ANNA AND CLAYTON.\n>> GREAT INTERVIEW.",

DAN, LET ME START BY GOING TO\nWHAT JAMES SAID. HE SAID THIS IS A WINNER FOR\nTRUMP ON RESTRICTING IMMIGRATION FROM COUNTRIES WITH A HISTORY OF\nTERRORISM. DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT?\n>> AS YOU SUGGESTED PAUL, THERE ARE TWO TRUMPS AT THE MOMENT\nRUNNING.

KIM, WHAT DO YOU THINK THE BIG\nDIFFERENCES ARE BETWEEN TRUMP'S ANTI-TERROR STRATEGY AND HILLARY\nCLINTON? >> LOOK, HILLARY CLINTON HAS\nBASICALLY SAID SHE WILL CONTINUE BARACK OBAMA'S FOREIGN POLICY\nSTRATEGY AND DONALD TRUMP DID VERY, VERY WELL CRITIQUE THAT IN\nTHAT SPEECH. I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT\nWOULD MATTER IS HE IS GOING TO TALK AS JASON SAID MORE OPENLY\nABOUT WHAT THE THREAT IS. HE IS GOING TO TRY TO MAYBE\nPROSECUTE THIS IN A LOT MORE AGGRESSIVE WAY.\nBUT THE SPECIFICS, THIS IS A PROBLEM, IS WHAT'S MISSING.\nYOU KNOW, I DISAGREE A LITTLE BIT WITH JAMES ON THE IDEA THAT\nTHERE IS A DISTINCTION BETWEEN TRUMP AND OBAMA.\nHE'S BEEN VERY RETICENT TO SAY WHAT HE WOULD DO IN SYRIA.\nWE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THAT COMMITMENT FROM HIM.\nSO THIS IS ONE OF THE LACKING ASPECTS OF HIS FOREIGN POLICY,\nWE DON'T KNOW WHAT HE WOULD DO. >> I WANT TO GET IN THE NEWS\nTHIS WEEK WITH THE CLINTON FOUNDATION RELATING TO FOREIGN\nPOLICY BECAUSE THEY HAVE ACCEPTED FOREIGN DONATIONS IN\nTHE PAST. NOW THEY'RE SAYING THAT IF\nHILLARY CLINTON WINS, THEY WON'T ACCEPT ANY FOREIGN DONATION.\nNOW, THEY ALREADY PROMISED EIGHT YEARS AGO THAT THEY WOULDN'T\nACCEPT ANY FOREIGN DONATIONS WHEN HILLARY WAS SECRETARY OF\nSTATE.

AND THOSE REMARKS WERE MADE THIS\nWEEK, BUT CRITICS POUNCED ON HIM SAYING THAT THOSE WERE REMARKS\nMADE BEFORE A LARGELY WHITE AUDIENCE.\n>> WELL, YOU KNOW, REALLY DOESN'T MATTER WHAT HE DOES.\nHE'S GOING TO BE CRITICIZED. BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS HE'S\nSTARTING TO REACH OUT. YOU KNOW, TRADITIONALLY THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY HAS NOT REACHED OUT TO THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nCOMMUNITY, TO THE HISPANIC COMMUNITIES, BECAUSE THEY'VE\nCONCEDED THOSE TO THE DEMOCRATS. AND DONALD TRUMP RECOGNIZES THAT\nIF OUR COUNTRY IS TO SUCCEED, EVERYBODY HAS TO SUCCEED.\nWE'RE ON THE SAME BOAT. IF PART OF THE BOAT SINKS THE\nREST OF IT IS GOING DOWN, TOO. SO HE'S GOING TO BE OFFERING\nREAL PROGRAMS, NOT THINGS THAT KEEP PEOPLE IN A STATE OF\nDEPENDENCY BUT THINGS THAT ALLOW PEOPLE TO MOVE OUT.\nFOR INSTANCE, JUST AS ONE EXAMPLE, WE'VE GOT $2.1 TRILLION\nOVERSEAS. BRINGING THAT BACK, REPATRIATING\nTHAT MONEY WITHOUT A TAX BURDEN, BUT WITH A REQUIREMENT THAT 10%\nOF IT BE USED IN ENTERPRISE SEVENS AND TO CREATE JOBS FOR\nPEOPLE WHO ARE UNDEREMPLOYED, UNEMPLOYED, OR ON WELFARE.\nTHAT WOULD BE THE BIGGEST STIMULUS SINCE FDR AND THAT YOU\nCAN USE THAT FOR INTRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS, TOO.\nTHAT'S LOW HANGING FRUIT. DOESN'T COST THE TAXPAYERS ONE\nPENNY. AND AS FAR AS THE SCHOOL SYSTEMS\nARE CONCERNED YOU HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE STUCK IN FAILING\nSCHOOL SYSTEMS. AND THAT HAS IS A TREMENDOUS\nIMPACT ON WHAT HAPPENS IN THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.\nHE'S GOING TO BE DEALING WITH THAT, WITH SCHOOL CHOICE, WITH\nVOUCHER PROGRAMS AND ALSO LOOKING AT THE PRISON SYSTEMS.\nWE'VE GOT HIGH RECIDIVISM RATE. PEOPLE GO IN WITH NO SKILLS.\nTHEY GO IN WITH NO EDUCATION. THEY COME OUT WITH NO SKILLS AND\nNO EDUCATION. WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO?\nGO BACK TO THE SAME THING THAT GOT THEM THERE IN THE FIRST\nPLACE. WE HAVE TO CHANGE THAT SO WE\nDON'T HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE GOING INTO THE PRISON.\nTHESE ARE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE LOOKED AT THAT HAVE NOT BEEN\nDEALT WITH BY THE PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENTS THAT BEEN IN CHARGE\nPARTICULARLY OF OUR INNER CITIES FOR A VERY LONG PERIOD OF TIME.\nTHEY DON'T LIKE IT WHEN PEOPLE LIKE ME TALK ABOUT IT.\nYOU KNOW, THEY CALL US ALL KINDS OF NAMES.\nTHE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, THEY WANT TO MAINTAIN CONTROL.\nTHEY WANT TO CULTIVATE VOTES. BUT WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT\nSOMETHING MORE THAN THAT, AND DRUCH RECOGNIZES THAT HE'S NOT\nGOING TO GET A LOT OF THOSE VOTE THE FIRST TIME AROUND BUT IF HE\nGETS INTO OFFICE AND THESE PROGRAMS, HE WILL.\n>> HOW DO YOU TRANSLATE THAT MESSAGE TO FOLKS IN THE INNER\nCITIES WHO REALLY BELIEVE THAT MANY POLITICIANS ONLY SHOW UP IN\nTHEIR NEIGHBORHOODS WHEN IT'S VOTING TIME?\nTHAT SO OFTEN THEY FEEL DISENGAGED FROM THE PROCESS AND\nBELIEVE THAT THERE ARE SO MANY BROKEN PROMISES IN THE PAST, WHY\nSHOULD THEY BELIEVE SOMEONE LIKE DONALD TRUMP RIGHT NOW, DO YOU\nEXPECT HIM TO GO DIRECTLY INTO THE INNER CITIES AS THIS FALLS\nTO TRY TO TAKE THAT MESSAGE AND DRIVE IT HOME ABOUT, YOU KNOW,\nTHE FACT THAT HE WANTS TO CREATE BETTER URBAN ENVIRONMENTS AND\nTHAT HE WANTS TO BRING JOBS AND CREATE BETTER SCHOOLS WHERE\nPEOPLE HAVE SEEN THOSE SCHOOLS FAILING OVER THE LAST SEVERAL\nYEARS? >> WITHOUT QUESTION, HE WILL BE\nGOING INTO THE INNER CITIES AND TALKING TO SOME OF THESE GROUPS.\nNO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. BECAUSE, AGAIN, YOU KNOW, HE'S\nNOT LIKE YOUR TRADITIONAL POLITICIAN.\nALL THEY DO IS THEY PANDER AND THEY PROMISE.\nBUT I HOPE YOU REALLY MAKES THE POINT TO PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, THE\nPROGRESSIVES ARE SAYING, LET'S TAKE THIS PIE AND, YOU KNOW,\nTHESE PEOPLE HAVE A BIGGER SHARE OF IT THAN YOU DO.\nSO LET'S REDIVIDE THIS AND REDISTRIBUTE THAT SO THAT WE\nMAKE EVERYTHING FAIR. IT SOUNDS GREAT.\nIT SOUNDS WONDERFUL. AND THEN NOTHING CHANGES.\nAND WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT IS MAKING A LOT OF PIES, SO RATHER\nTHAN YOU TAKING FROM THIS PERSON AND GIVING TO THIS PERSON, LET'S\nMAKE A LOT OF PIES, A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR EVERYBODY.\nTHAT'S HOW AMERICA GOT TO BE SUCH A POWER HOUSE.\nAND A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. AND WE CAN EASILY DO THAT.\nBY TAKING A I WAY SOME OF THE INCREDIBLE RESTRICTIONS.\nYOU LOOK AT A SMALL EMPLOYER, LESS THAN 50 EMPLOYEES IN A\nMANUFACTURING SEGMENT. THE AVERAGE COST PER EMPLOYEE TO\nCOMPLY WITH ALL THE REGULATIONS IS $34,000 A YEAR.\nNOW, HOW IN THE WORLD IS HE GOING TO BE COMPETITIVE WITH\nANOTHER COUNTRY? YOU KNOW, THESE ARE THE KINDS OF\nTHINGS THAT TRUMP UNDERSTANDS THAT HILLARY CLINTON DOESN'T\nHAVE A CLUE ABOUT. >> DR. BEN CARSON TELLING US\nTHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE MORE OF DONALD TRUMP HITTING THE URBAN\nCENTERS OF THE COUNTRY, TRYING TO MAKE THAT PITCH AND HOPE THAT\nHE CAN WOO MORE AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND LATINO VOTERS TO HIS CATCH.\nTHANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US.\n>> THANK YOU, UMA.",

HE SAID HE WAS APOLOGIZING NOW\nBECAUSE HE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT HIS OTHER TEAMMATES WERE\nNOT FACING ANY LEGAL PROBLEMS HERE IN BRAZIL.\nTHEY ARE ALL NOW BACK IN THE UNITED STATES.\nAND HE WRITES IN PART, I WANT TO APOLOGIZE FOR MY BEHAVIOR LAST\nWEEKEND, FOR NOT BEING MORE CAREFUL AND CANDID IN HOW I\nDESCRIBE EVENTS. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN A LOT MORE\nCRITICAL THAN HIS OWN WORDS ON HOW HE DESCRIBED THOSE EVENTS.\nAS YOU KNOW, HE INITIALLY HAD SAID THAT HE AND TEAMMATES WERE\nHELD BY GUNPOINT BY SOMEONE POSING AS A POLICE OFFICER AND\nROBBED. THEN TURNED OUT THERE WAS AN\nINCIDENT AT A GAS STATION AND THAT THE EARLY HOURS OF SUNDAY\nTHAT THEY WERE DRUNK, THAT LOCHTE HIMSELF HAD PULLED A\nBILLBOARD OFF OF THAT GAS STATION, AND THAT THEY WERE\nFORCED TO STAY AT GUNPOINT, IN FACT, BY A SECURITY GUARD.\nAND LOCHTE MENTIONS THAT MOMENT.

THEY GOT MARRIED IN 2013.\nWHEN SAME-SEX MARRIAGE BECAME LEGAL IN GREAT BRITAIN, AND\nTODAY, THEY WON THAT GOLD MEDAL.

HE'S 32 YEARS OLD.\nHE'S NOT A TEENAGER. THERE'S SO MANY QUESTIONS TO ASK\nABOUT HIS BEHAVIOR BASED ON HIS BEING 32 YEARS OLD.\nBUT TO HAVE PRODEPOFESSIONALS AD YOU, THIS IS A MAN WHO IS\nSUSPENDED AND IS TRYING TO GET A LESSER SUSPENSION.\n>> HE DID TALK ABOUT HIS HOPES FOR THE FUTURE, SAYING THAT HE\nWANTS TO CONTINUE SWIMMING IF THEY ALLOW HIM TO DO SO.\nWE KNOW MICHAEL PHELPS CAME BACK FROM TWO DUIS AND LOOK AT WHERE\nHE WOUND UP.

HE IS CLEARLY BEING ADVISED, AND\nHE REALIZES THAT THE SILENCE FOR FIVE DAYS WAS DEVASTATING AS\nEVENTS UNFOLDED IN RIO AND HE OF COURSE WAS BACK SAFELY AT HOME,\nALL THE REMNANTS OF THIS DRUNKEN RAMPAGE AND RIDICULOUS FIASCO\nWERE PLAYING OUT, AND HE WAS REALLY NOT SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT\nIT. >> WE KNOW HE CERTAINLY WAS\nADVISED, NOT ONLY ADVISED BUT ADVISED BY ONE OF THE BEST\nCRISIS PR MANAGERS IN THE BUSINESS, MATTHEW HILTIG.\nHE DIDN'T JUST GIVE THAT INTERVIEW TO NBC.\nHE GAVE A SECOND INTERVIEW TO GLOBAL TELEVISION, BRAZILIAN\nTELEVISION NETWORK, IN AN EFFORT TO DIRECTLY APOLOGIZE TO THE\nPEOPLE OF BRAZIL. HOW IMPORTANT DO YOU THINK THAT\nIS? >> Reporter: OH, I THINK THAT'S\nHUGE, POPPY. BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW AND SO MANY\nPEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS STORY NOW, THE NARRATIVE\nHAS ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT THE CONCERNS ABOUT BRAZILIAN STREET\nCRIME. AND WHEN ALMOST A WEEK AGO NOW,\nWHEN WE FIRST HEARD THE NEWS THAT RYAN LOCHTE SAID THAT HE\nHAD A GUN PUT TO HIS FOREHEAD, IT PLAYED INTO EVERY STEREOTYPE\nAND CONCERN THAT PEOPLE HAD FROM AROUND THE WORLD WHO COME TO RIO\nFOR THESE OLYMPIC GAMES. WE KNOW OF COURSE THAT THAT\nSTORY WAS AT LEAST PARTIALLY FABRICATED, AND NOW RYAN IS\nTELLING ANOTHER STORY. SO YES, I THINK IT'S FANTASTIC\nTHAT HE HAS MADE THE DECISION TO SPEAK TO THE PEOPLE OF RIO,\nBECAUSE THEY WERE SO AFFECTED BY THE STORY THAT HE MADE UP.\n>> LET'S GET TO THE CONSEQUENCES HERE.\nYOUR SOURCES TELLING YOU THAT HE WILL INDEED BE SUSPENDED.\nI MEAN, FOR HOW LONG, WHAT IS THE PUNISHMENT GOING TO LOOK\nLIKE? >> Reporter: AS YOU MAY HAVE\nHEARD, AS REPORTED EARLIER TODAY, THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC\nCOMMITTEE IS NOW SETTING UP A COMMISSION TO LOOK INTO THIS.\nWHAT I THINK THAT DOES, POPPY, IS ELONGATES THE CONVERSATION.\nTHE U.S. OLYMPIC COMMITTEE WILL BE PLAYING A BIG ROLE.\nUSA SWIMMING, THE NATIONAL GOVERNING BODY TO THE SPORT, IS\nGOING TO BE PLAYING A BIG ROLE IN THIS.\nAND NOW THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE.\nWHO KNOWS WHO WILL GO FIRST, ALTHOUGH I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED\nIF IT'S USA SWIMMING IN TERMS OF PUNISHMENT BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN\nSO NO-NONSENSE ON MICHAEL PHELPS AND OTHERS OVER THE YEARS.\nTHIS MAY BE MORE ELONGATED THAN WE THOUGHT.\nA DECISION MAY NOT COME IN THE NEXT WEEK OR TWO JUST BECAUSE SO\nMANY PEOPLE ARE NOW LOOKING AT THESE FOUR SWIMMERS, ESPECIALLY\nLOCHTE, AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PUNISH THEM.\n>> CHRISTINE, LOCHTE IS 32, HE'S CLOSER TO THE END OF HIS CAREER\nTHAN THE OTHER THREE SWIMMERS THAT WERE WITH HIM THAT ARE MUCH\nYOUNGER. WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR THEM?\n>> Reporter: FOR THEM, LET'S SAY THEY'RE SUSPENDED, AND I DON'T\nTHINK WHAT THE LENGTH WOULD BE, OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE\nNONE OF THIS HAS HAPPENED YET. LET'S SAY MICHAEL PHELPS IS\nSUSPENDED FOR SIX MONTHS FOR DRUNK DRIVING, THEY MAY STILL BE\nBACK FOR THE NEXT OLYMPIC GAMES. RYAN LOCHTE, IT'S HARD TO\nIMAGINE HIM AT AGE 36 COMING BACK TO THE OLYMPIC GAMES.\nI THINK HE WOULD ALSO GET A BIGGER SUSPENSION SIMPLY BECAUSE\nHE WAS CLEARLY THE RINGLEADER, AND FROM THE STORIES THE OTHERS\nTOLD, IT SOUNDS LIKE LOCHTE MISBEHAVED IN WAYS THAT WERE\nPARTICULARLY EMBARRASSING TO THE OLYMPIC COMMITTEE AS A\nREPRESENTATIVE OF OUR NATION AS AN ATHLETE AT THESE GAMES.\n>> CHRISTINE BRENNAN, PHENOMENAL REPORTING ALL WEEK ON THIS.\nAND THE ACTUAL GAMES AND THE WONDERFUL THINGS OUT OF THE\nOLYMPICS THAT MATTER THE MOST.

GUNNAR AND CONGER, BOTH NUMBER\nONE APOLOGIZED. NUMBER TWO, SAID THEY WERE NEVER\nA SUSPECT. ONLY A WITNESS AND NUMBER THREE,\nIDENTIFIED THEY NEVER PROVIDED MISLEADING STATEMENTS.\nTHE FIRST TWO ARE IMPORTANT IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION THE\nLATTER IN LAW. IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE\nHOW PART TWO SO TO SPEAK PLAYS OUT MOVING FORWARD.\n>> I THINK IT'S INTERESTING THE POLICE IF RIO SAID LOOK YOU NEED\nTO APOLOGIZE TO THE PEOPLE OF RIO, THE SMEAR THIS HAS LEFT ON\nOUR CITY IN THE EYES OF THE WORLD.\nAND CHRISTINE BRENNAN, OUR SPORTS ANALYST POINTED OUT RYAN\nLOCHTE DID A LENGTHY STATEMENT AND APOLOGY, HE FIRST APOLOGIZED\nTO HIS SPONSORS BEFORE ANYONE ELSE.\n>> RIGHT. THERE'S PROBABLY A LITTLE\nSEMANTICS THERE. I THINK THERE IS NO QUESTION HE\nSHOULD HAVE IDENTIFIED RESPONSIBILITY, CULPABILITY AND\nMOST ASSUREDLY REMORSE FOR A VARIETY OF THINGS, NOP THE LEAST\nOF WHICH IS THE FOCUS THIS HAS PUT ON THE PEOPLE OFRYIO.\nI THINK SALLY JENKINS POINTED OUT A COUPLE INTERESTING FACTS\nTHAT PUT THIS INTO CONTEXT. NUMBER ONE IN THE MONTH OF JUNE\nIN RIO. THERE WERE 11,000 VIOLENT\nCRIMES. NUMBER TWO, THE UNEMPLOYMENT\nRATE IS AROUND 11% AND NUMBER THREE, THE MEDIAN MINIMUM WAGE\nPER MONTH IS AROUND $228. ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT A COUNTRY\nREELING ECONOMICALLY AND A SPIRIT STAND.SO FOR THEM, THIS\nWAS AN ABSOLUTE PR BLACK EYE THAT JUST REALLY HEIGHTENS THE\nNEGATIVITY AND THE GLOBAL IMPETUS --\n>> BECAUSE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. >> YES.\nMY POINT INSURING ABOUT SALLY, I THINK SALLY IS A FANTASTIC\nJOURNALIST. SHE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE\nCONTEXT THAT REALLY UNDERSCORED AND VALIDED THE BRAZILIAN FERVOR\nAROUND THE SITUATION. TO PIVOT AND LOOK AT LOCHTE'S\nNEXT STEPS. THE TEAM AROUND HIM THE TEAM,\nFIRST AND FOREMOST THE U.S. OLYMPIC TEAM.\nSCOTT BLACKMAN ON DOWN THEY DON'T COME FINER THAN TEAM USA.\nNUMBER TWO, USA SWIMMING. HE IS AT COLORADO USA SWIMMING,\nTHEY ARE NOT ONLY HOLDING THEIR ATHLETES ACCOUNTABLE BUT\nPROMOTING THE GOOD DEEDS OF THOSE THAT CARRY THE FLAG AND\nEMBODY THE OLYMPIC SPIRIT. RYAN WILL HAVE CONSEQUENCE TO\nATONE FOR AND STRATEGICALLY I THINK IT WOULD BE IN HIS BEST\nINTEREST NOT TO FIGHT THE PUN IBMENT ALBEIT FROM A LIFETIME\nDOWN. >> IF YOU WERE HIS AGENT.\nARE YOU NOT. IF YOU WERE ADVISING HIM ON THIS\nINTERVIEW, WHAT SHOULD HE SAY FIRST?\n>> AT THIS POINT, POPPY, IT'S BRUTAL HONESTY.\nFIRST OF ALL, ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HE MADE AN ERROR, NOT ONLY IN\nACTION, BUT ARGUABLY MORE IMPORTANTLY IN THE SUBSEQUENT\nDAYS HOW IT WAS HANDLED. AS ALL OF OUR MOMS TO HIM US THE\nCOVERUP IS WORSE THAN THE CRIME. I THINK IN SO MANY WAYS, THIS IS\nWHAT WE WERE LOOKING AT HERE. IT WASN'T THE INITIAL ACTION.\nCHRISTINE AGREED YESTERDAY THE ACTION WAS INDEFENSIBLE.\nBUT IT WAS HOW THIS HANDLED IN THE DAYS FOLLOWED THAT DREW THE\nIRE AND GLOBAL ATTENTION. INSOFAR AS STRATEGY MOVING\nFORWARD, YOU GOT A GREAT SOUNDING BOARD ON MATT LAUER.\nSPEAK HONESTLY AND FROM THE HEART.\nTHIS NEEDS TO BE AS MUCH AS IT CAN BE OUTSIDE THE OBVIOUS LEGAL\nHURDLE HE WILL HAVE TO NAVIGATE IN THE WEEKS AND DAYS AHEAD.\nTHIS NEEDS TO BE SINCERE, TO MATCH IN SUBSTANCE AS MUCH AS IT\nDOES IN STYLE. LEAD WITH AN APOLOGY, AN\nAPOLOGY, PREMISE AND ACCOUNTABLY.\nRIGHT. UNTIL YOU ACKNOWLEDGE\nACCOUNTABILITY AND WRONG DOING, YOU CAN'T MOVE FORWARD.\n>> MAYBE NO, I'M SORRY, BUT. >> EXACTLY.\nTHERE SHOULD BE NO BUTs OR ASTERISKS.\nTHERE SHOULD BE NO COMMENTS, A SIMPLEKABILITY.\nI THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT.\nYOU SAID I WAS CONTRAMPBLT I WOULD SAY OBJECTIVE MORE THAN\nCONTRARIAN. I'D SAY IT'S PROBABLY IMPORTANT\nFOR US TO ACT KNOWLEDGE SOMETIMES THERE IS A FINE LINE\nBETWEEN DEMANDING ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONTRITION AND DEMANDING A\nPOUND OF FLEMPBLT AT WHAT POINT WOULD RYAN HAVE TO HAVE DONE\nENOUGH FOR HIS MISGIVINGS? A SIMPLE APOLOGY IS NOT ENOUGH.\nIT'S MOST ASSUREDLY THE FIRST STEP.\nIT WILL BE HOW HE SERVES AS A ROLE MODEL AND A MENTOR FOR\nSTUDENT ATHLETES, THAT WILL ULTIMATELY BE THE MOST IMPORTANT\nSTEP. >> I'M GETTING THE WRAP.\nTHANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.

THEY TOLD THE OTHER SWIMMERS GET\nDOWN ON THE GROUND -- I'M NOT KIDDING.\nDOWN ON THE GROUND. AND THEN THE GUY PULLED OUT HIS\nGUN. HE TAPPED IT, PUT IT TO MY\nFOREHEAD AND SAID GET DOWN. I PUT MY HANDS UP, I WAS LIKE\nWHATEVER. >> THEY STOOD UP TO THESE GUYS,\nOBVIOUSLY THAT WAS A BRAVE AND DANGEROUS THING TO DO.\n>> BUT LOCHTE CHANGED SOME CRUCIAL DETAILS IN A FOLLOW-UP\nINTERVIEW WITH MATT LAUER. AND YESTERDAY IN YET ANOTHER\nINTERVIEW HE BACKED OFF A BIT MORE.\n>> THE FIRST VERSION OF THE STORY YOU TOLD, RYAN, WAS MUCH\nMORE ABOUT THE MEAN STREETS OF RIO.\n>> YEAH. >> AND THE VERSION WE'RE HEARING\nNOW IS MUCH MORE ABOUT A NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT TO COVER\nUP SOME DUMB BEHAVIOR. >> AND THAT'S WHY I'M TAKING\nFULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT.

A COMPLETE AND TOTAL LIE.\nAND NOW IN TWO SUCCESSIVE INTERVIEWS WITH NBC HE APPEARS\nUNWILLING OR UNABLE TO ADMIT THAT.\n>> YEAH, WELL, OBVIOUSLY HE NOW HAD SOME COACHING.\nHE HIRED A BIG CRISIS COMMUNICATION EXPERT.\nAND THAT'S WHY HE WENT AND DID THAT SIT-DOWN INTERVIEW WITH\nMATT LAUER. MORE IS GOING TO AIR ON \"TODAY\"\nSHOW ON MONDAY. SO WE'LL HEAR MORE.\nTHIS IS PAR FOR THE COURSE. WHEN YOU GET INTO TROUBLE, YOU\nTRY TO MAKE AMENDS. WHEN YOU DO AN INTERVIEW, YOU DO\nTHIS APOLOGY INTERVIEW AND HOPE YOU DON'T LOSE YOUR ENDORSEMENT\nDEALS, WHICH COULD BE $5 MILLION TO $10 MILLION.\n>> MAKING AMENDS. I'M SORRY.\nI LIED. I SHOULDN'T HAVE LIED.\nIT WAS A REALLY BAD THING TO DO. I MEAN, THESE WEASEL WORDS ARE\nNOT CUTTING IT, CRISIS COMMUNICATIONS OR NOT.\nTHIS IS THE CLASSIC NON-APOLOGY APOLOGY.\n>> IT'S TRUE. HE DID SAY IT WAS IMMATURE\nBEHAVIOR, HE OVEREXAGGERATED. ONE THING I THINK THAT A LOT OF\nPEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT IS WHEN MATT LAUER SAID, SO ARE YOU\nWILLING TO NOW SAY IT WASN'T ROBBERY?\nBECAUSE THAT WAS REALLY THE ONE POINT, IT WAS ROBBERY, WE WERE\nTHE VICTIMS IN THIS WHOLE THING. AND MATT GAVE HIM THAT OPENING\nTO SAY ARE YOU WILLING NOW TO SAY IT WASN'T ROBBERY.\nHE SAID, WELL, IT COULD BE ROBBERY, COULD BE MAKING AMENDS\nAND RESTITUTION -- >> WELL, I KIND OF FELT\nTHREATENED BECAUSE THE GUY HAD A GUN.\nORIGINALLY THEY WERE IN A TAXI. THEY WERE PULLED OUT BY SOMEBODY\nPRETENDING TO BE A COP. THE GUN WAS TO HIS HEAD.\nI MEAN, THIS WAS NOT JUST EMBELLISHED, THIS WAS FICTION.\nBUT LET'S GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL STORY.\nNBC'S PAID BILLIONS FOR THE OLYMPICS, AIRING THE INTERVIEWS.\n>> RIGHT. >> AND LOCHTE MAKES THESE\nCHARGES, WE SAW THE REPORTER SAY AND THIS WAS A VERY BRAVE THING\nFOR HIM TO DO TO DEFY THE GUNMEN.\nSHOULD THE PRESS HAVE FALLEN FOR THIS?\nIT ALWAYS SEEMS LIKE THE STORY -- ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME\nSOMETHING WRONG WITH THE STORY BUT I DIDN'T THINK HE WAS MAKING\nIT UP. SHOULD THE PRESS HAVE BEEN LESS\nGULLIBLE? >> I THINK IT PLAYED INTO THAT.\nAS MATT LAUER SAID IT PLAYED INTO THE MEAN STREETS OF RIO, SO\nPEOPLE WERE TO ACCEPT IT. PLUS THE ASPECT OF THE OLYMPICS,\nTHE SALACIOUS, THE TABLOID ASPECT THAT WE DIDN'T REALLY\nGET, THERE WAS THE GABBY DOUGLAS ISSUE THAT CAME UP PEOPLE WERE\nTALKING ABOUT, BUT THEN RATINGS WERE DOWN WITH THE OLYMPICS.\nTHE SEATS WERE EMPTY IN THE OLYMPICS.\nSO THIS KIND OF FIT INTO ANOTHER KIND OF WAY TO TALK ABOUT\nSOMETHING WHEN MAYBE SOME OF THE EVENTS WEREN'T GETTING THE KIND\nOF BUZZ.

THERE'S THE LATEST NBC NEWS WALL\nSTREET JOURNAL POLL GIVES TRUMP 1% TO HILLARY CLINTON'S 94%.\nANOTHER MINORITY GROUP HE'S REACHING OUT TO, LATINO\nAMERICANS. TODAY IN NEW YORK, TRUMP AND THE\nNEW LEADERSHIP TEAM MET WITH THE NATIONAL HISPANIC ADVISORY\nCOUNCIL FOR TRUMP. IT WAS AN EFFORT TO SHARE\nINSIGHTS WITH THE CAMPAIGN TO HELP GET A NOVEMBER VICTORY.\nJOINING ME NOW IS JOE WATT, AND JAMEEL SMITH.\nLET'S START WITH YOU HERE, JAMEEL.\nWHAT IS THE PERCENTAGE THAT HE CAN POSSIBLY, POTENTIALLY PULL\nOVER FROM THAT 91%, YOU THINK? >> I DON'T THINK THIS IS ABOUT\nPULLING OVER A PERCENTAGE AT ALL.\nTHIS IS MAKING SURE THAT HIS WHITE VOTERS UNDERSTAND THAT\nHEY, THESE BLACK VOTERS -- IF THEY WANT A BETTER FUTURE,\nTHEY'LL CHOOSE ME. AND ONCE THEY DON'T CHOOSE HIM,\nTHEY CAN STAY IN THEIR NARRATIVE THAT HEY, BLACK FOLKS JUST\nCHOOSE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY BECAUSE THEY'RE IN A DEMOCRATIC\nPLANTATIONS AND IT'S MORE ABOUT MAKING WHITE VOTERS FEEL\nCOMFORTABLE THAT TRUMP IS NOT IN FACT A RACIST.\n>> JOE, TO REACT TO THAT, WHAT'S YOUR PERSPECTIVE IN TERMS OF A\nPIVOT HERE AND REACHING OUT TO AFRICAN AMERICAN VOTERS AND\nREALLY THAT SORT OF HALO EFFECT OF MINORITY VOTERS OVERALL.\n>> AFRICAN AMERICAN VOTERS AND LATINO VOTERS ARE VERY\nSOPHISTICATED VOTERS. THEY AREN'T EASILY SWAYED BY A\nPITCH AT A CAMPAIGN SPEECH. THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT HAS\nTO BE DONE IF YOU WANT TO SERIOUSLY BUILD ON THE NUMBERS\nTHAT YOU ALREADY HAVE. AND RIGHT NOW, HE'S POLLING\nABOUT 1% WITH AFRICAN AMERICAN VOTERS.\nIF HE WANTS TO GET UP TO 8, 9, 10, 11, # 12%, IT'S GOING TO\nTAKE A LOT OF WORK. JUST RECITING THE CHALLENGES\nWHERE PEOPLE ARE FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR IN THIS COUNTRY ISN'T\nENOUGH. YOU'VE GOT TO SHOW PEOPLE WHAT\nYOU'RE GOING TO DO TO MEASURABLY CHANGE THEIR CONDITION.\nAND YOU ALSO CAN'T TALK TO BLACK PEOPLE AS IF ALL BLACK PEOPLE\nHAVE THE SAME SITUATION. WE DON'T.\nBLACK PEOPLE ARE MIDDLE CLASS, UPPER MIDDLE CLASS, AND POOR\nPEOPLE. YOU HAVE TO TALK TO BLACK PEOPLE\nLIKE WE'RE PEOPLE. >> AS PEOPLE.\nAND WHERE THEY'RE AT. JAMEEL, IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE HE\nWAS ANNOUNCING THIS PUSH WHEN HE WAS TALKING TO AFRICAN AMERICAN\nVOTERS. IT WAS NOT IN A BACKGROUND THAT\nYOU HAD A LOT OF AFRICAN AMERICANS.\n>> IF YOU WANT TO WIN OUR VOTES, HE HAS TO TALK TO US.\nTHAT'S PLAIN AND SIMPLE. THESE REJECTED IMPLICATIONS FROM\nTHE NAACP AND THE URBAN LEAGUE. HE'S SHOWN AN AVERSION TO\nSOMETHING THAT SHOWS BLACK PEOPLE.\nYOU HAVE RACIAL UNREST THIS WEEK THIS PAST WEEK IN THE LAST WEEK\nBEFORE. AND HE DIDN'T GO TO MILWAUKEE.\nHE HAS SAID GOES TO A TOWN THAT IS 40 MILES OUTSIDE, THAT'S\nALMOST ENTIRELY WHITE BEFORE AN ENTIRELY WHITE AUDIENCE.\nI DON'T THINK THAT BLACK VOTERS ARE NECESSARILY FOOLED BY THAT.\n>> HE'LL HAVE TO REPOSITION HIS TRAVEL SCHEDULE WHICH HAS MAYBE\nBEEN LAID OUT FOR WEEKS BEFORE THEY MADE THIS STRATEGIC PUSH\nHERE. JOE, YOU KNOW, AS YOU LOOK AT\nWHAT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS DOING.\nWHAT MIGHT THEY DO, YOU THINK, TO STAB OFF THIS MOVE IF SHE\nDOES SHED WOMEN, HISPANIC, AND MINORITY VOTERS OVERALL?\n>> I DON'T KNOW THAT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS WORRIED THAT THEY'RE\nGOING TO LOSE ANY VOTES. YOU KNOW, BY WHAT'S BEING DONE\nRIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW, FOR AT LEAST FOR ME, I'VE BEEN INVOLVED\nIN THESE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS AND I'VE WORKED FOR U.S. SENATOR\nFOR U.S. PRESIDENT, I KNOW THAT IN MOST OF THESE OTHER CYCLES IN\nORDER TO WIN ANY SEGMENT OF THE VOTE, IT TAKES SERIOUS WORK.\nYOU'VE GOT TO HAVE PEOPLE THAT REPRESENT THOSE COMMUNITIES ON\nSTAFF WORKING CLOSELY WITH YOU AND CREDIBILITY WITHIN THEIR OWN\nCOMMUNITY. MOLD AND MESSAGE THAT RESINATES\nWITH VOTERS IN THE COMMUNITIES. THEN YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A\nSERIOUS GET OUT TO VOTE CAMPAIGN, AND SPEND MONEY\nGETTING YOUR MESSAGE OUT AND MAKING SURE THE PEOPLE LIKELY TO\nVOTE SHOW UP TO THE POLLS TO VOTE FOR YOU.\nTHAT TAKES A LOT OF WORK, MONEY, EFFORT.\nSO IF IF HE WANTS TO CHANGE THE NUMBERS, IF HE WANTS TO REALLY\nTALK TO THE COMMUNITY TO COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHETHER\nIT'S THE LATINO COMMUNITY OR THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY, IT'S\nGOING TO TAKE A SERIOUS INVESTMENT OF TIME, MONEY, AND\nEFFORT, AND PEOPLE IN ORDER TO GET THAT DONE.\n>> AND PEOPLE. IT'S A PEOPLE BUSINESS.\nAND JAMEEL, AS JOE WAS TALKING ABOUT REFINING THE MESSAGE.\nHE'S SAYING HEY, I DID GET THE MESSAGE RIGHT.\nI REGRET SOME OF THE STUFF I SAID EARLIER.\nDO YOU THINK HE WAS ELUDING TO COMMENTS THAT WERE NOT SEEN\nPOSITIVELY BY THE MUSLIM AMERICAN COMMUNITY, NOT SEEMING\nPOSITIVELY BY THE LATINO AMERICAN COMMUNITY OVER THE LAST\nSEVERAL MONTHS? >> I THINK IT WAS A CLASSIC\nSORRY NOT SORRY APOLOGY. IT DOESN'T EVEN QUALIFY AS AN\nAPOLOGY. IT WAS SO UNGENERAL AND SO BLAND\nTHAT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS APOLOGIZING FOR.\nTHERE ARE FEW TOO MANY PEOPLE GIVING HIM COOKIES FOR PAYING\nATTENTION IN MEETINGS AND EXPRESSING REGRET IN ONE SPEECH.\nTHAT ALL THE SUDDEN THIS IS A DIFFERENT CANDIDATE.\nHE JUST BROUGHT ON THE HEAD OF A WHITE NATIONALIST NEWS SITE TO\nRUN HIS CAMPAIGN. PEOPLE ARE REALLY PAYING\nATTENTION AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT HE'S ABOUT.\n>> AND THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THAT\nCOMMENTARY ABOUT HIS REGRET, QUOTE/UNQUOTE THAT HE WAS\nMENTIONING. THEY RELEASED THIS VIDEO, LET'S\nTAKE A LOOK. >> I REGRET IT.\n>> IF YOU LOOK AT HIS WIFE, SHE HAD NOTHING TO SAY.\nMAYBE SHE WASN'T ALLOWED TO HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY.\n>> DO YOU REGRET ENGAGING THIS BACK AND FORTH?\n>> I DON'T REGRET ANYTHING. >> HE WAS A WAR HERO BECAUSE HE\nWAS CAPTURED. I LIKE PEOPLE THAT WEREN'T\nCAPTURED. >> DO YOU REGRET SAYING THAT?\n>> I LIKE NOT TO REGRET ANYTHING.\n>> SO AS HE'S NOW DOING THE TOUR NOW INVESTING IN HIS FIRST AD\nHERE, JAMEEL, IS THIS GOING TO WORK FROM THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN\nTO STAV OFF HIS MOVES HERE ON THE AIR WAVES?\n>> CERTAINLY WHAT HE DID IS PUT A BALL ON THE TEE FOR THE\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN TO HIT OFF. HE'S MADE HIS PRESENCE ABOUT THE\nTOXIC MASK LIN PRESENT, AND THEN ALL THE SUDDEN HE WANTS TO\nEXPRESS REGRET. YOU HAVE A WHOLE HEALTH OF\nMATERIAL TO HIT BACK ON HIM ON. I THINK THE CLINTONS ARE CONTENT\nTO LET HIM KEEP TALKING, BURYING HIMSELF, AND WHILE THEY, YOU\nKNOW, HOPEFULLY PUSH THEIR MESSAGE.\n>> ALL RIGHT. JOE WATKINS, JAMEEL SMITH, STAND\nBY.

YOU WANT TO GIVE THE GUY THE\nBENEFIT OF THE DOUBT IF THE OUTREACH IS GENUINE.\nBUT THE REACTION ABOUT THE TONE WAS ESSENTIALLY, YOU KNOW,\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS, YOU'RE KIND OF DUMB FOR SUPPORTING THE\nDEMOCRATS.

AND YOU KNOW, YOU TALK TO MOST\nREPUBLICAN STRATEGISTS AND THEY HAVE SOME IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO\nAPPROACH THIS COMMUNITY, WHICH OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVEN'T DONE SO\nWELL WITH IN RECENT YEARS. AND MOST OF THOSE STRATEGISTS\nWOULD NOT RECOMMEND THE WAY THAT DONALD TRUMP DID THIS.\nFOR ONE, THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING\nTO ANY AUDIENCE IS GO TO THEIR LEADERSHIP, GO TO THE POLICY\nPROFESSIONALS AND SAY WHAT IS IT THAT YOUR COMMUNITY CARES ABOUT\nAND HOW CAN WE FIND SOME COMMON GROUND.\nTWO, YOU MIGHT WANT TO GO AND SPEAK BEFORE AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nAUDIENCE IF YOU'RE APPEALING FOR THEIR VOTES.\nHIS SPEECHES RECENTLY ARE BEFORE OVERWHELMINGLY WHITE AUDIENCES.\nTHOSE ARE TWO THINGS THAT SURPRISE ME.\nTHE THIRD THING IS, HE HAS A VERY, VERY SIMPLISTIC VIEW ABOUT\nHOW AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE LIVING IN THE UNITED STATES.\nHE SEEMS TO THINK THAT ALL AFRICAN-AMERICANS BASED ON THAT\nQUOTE THAT YOU PLAYED ARE POOR, LIVING IN CRIME-RIDDEN AREAS,\nUNEMPLOYED, AND THAT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT TRUE.\nTHERE ARE UNIQUE PROBLEMS IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, BUT\nHE'S JUST GOT THE TONE AND A LITTLE BIT OFF I WOULD SAY.\n>> HOLLY, AS A CLINTON SUPPORTER, I WANT YOU TO LISTEN\nTO THIS. >> THE INNER CITIES OF OUR\nCOUNTRY HAVE BEEN RUN BY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY FOR MORE THAN\n50 YEARS. THEIR POLICIES HAVE PRODUCED\nONLY POVERTY, JOBLESSNESS, FAILING SCHOOLS, AND BROKEN\nHOMES. IT'S TIME TO HOLD DEMOCRATIC\nPOLITICIANS ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO THESE\nCOMMUNITIES. AT WHAT POINT DO WE SAY ENOUGH?\n>> SO, AS A DEMOCRAT, AS THE CLINTON SUPPORTER, HOLLY, TO\nTHAT, DOES HE HAVE A POINT? DO YOU THINK YOUR PARTY HAS DONE\nENOUGH FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS STRUGGLING IN THIS COUNTRY?\n>> WHEN HE ASKED WHAT PEOPLE COULD LOSE BY VOTING FOR HIM,\nIT'S EXACTLY THE WRONG QUESTION. WHAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR IS\nSOLUTIONS TO THEIR PROBLEMS. AND DONALD TRUMP SIMPLY DOESN'T\nHAVE ANY. >> SO MY QUESTION TO YOU WAS\nABOUT YOUR CANDIDATE AND YOUR PARTY.\nHAVE THEY DONE ENOUGH? >> OF COURSE.\nTHERE'S OBVIOUSLY MORE WORK TO DO IN THIS COUNTRY, BUT WE HAVE\nSUPPORTED AND PUT INTO PLACE POLICIES THE HAVE HELPED RAISE\nTHE MINIMUM WAGE IN THIS COUNTRY, WHO HAVE HELPED PUT\nPAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAMS LIKE IN PHILADELPHIA THAT WE'RE\nSEEING THAT WILL HELP ALL COMMUNITIES INCLUDING\nCOMMUNITIES OF COLOR. >> DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO RAISE\nTHE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE TO $10. >> DEPENDS ON WHICH DAY YOU ASK\nHIM THAT QUESTION BECAUSE SOME DAYS HE OPPOSES THEM ALL\nTOGETHER. I DON'T TRUST HIS OPINION THERE,\nBUT ALSO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HAVE VOTED MULTIPLE TIMES IN THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY TO OPPOSE RAISES OF THE MINIMUM WAGE.\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT EQUAL PAY, WHERE THE DEMOCRATS HAVE\nSUPPORTED EQUAL PAY LAWS TO IMPROVE THE PAY GAP, WHICH IS A\nPROBLEM THAT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR EVEN HAVE A WIDER GAP.\nAND SO I THINK THAT WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT SOLUTIONS, WHEN\nYOU'RE ASKING WHAT ARE THE SOLUTIONS?\nDONALD TRUMP CAN TALK UNTIL HE'S BLUE IN THE FACE ABOUT REACHING\nOUT TO COMMUNITIES OF COLOR, BUT UNTIL HE HAS ACTUAL POLICIES\nTHAT ARE GOING TO HELP, I'M REALLY NOT SURE IT'S GOING TO\nHELP HIS CAMPAIGN. >> AMY, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE\nOPTICS OF LAST NIGHT. HE GAVE THIS SPEECH IN\nDIAMONDDALE MICHIGAN, WHICH IS RIGHT OUTSIDE LANCING.\nIT IS 93% WHITE, ACCORDING TO CENSUS.\nOUR PRODUCERS WHO WERE THERE SAID THE AUDIENCE WAS ALMOST ALL\nWHITE. HE COULD HAVE GONE TO DETROIT,\nCOULD HAVE GONE TO LANCING FIVE MINUTES DOWN THE ROAD, MUCH MORE\nDIVERSE. NOT THE FIRST TIME HE DID THAT\nTHIS WEEK. ALSO WHEN HE SPOKE IN NEW\nHAMPSHIRE, HE SPOKE IN A CITY THAT IS LESS THAN 1% BLACK.\nWHY DOES HE KEEP DOING THIS? AND DO YOU THINK HE SHOULD\nCHANGE THE AUDIENCE? >> WELL, POPPY, I AM NOT PART OF\nTHE CAMPAIGN. I'M NOT INVOLVED IN THE DECISION\nMAKING PROCESS. >> RIGHT, BUT YOU'RE A\nSUPPORTER. WHAT WOULD YOUR ADVICE BE?\n>> THIS IS THE THING. THESE EVENTS ARE NOT THROWN\nTOGETHER AT THE LAST MINUTE, SO I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THEY HAVE\nHAD THESE EVENTS PLANNED. BUT IT IS POSSIBLE THEY HAVE HAD\nTHE EVENTS PLANNED AND HE'S CHANGING WHAT HE'S TALKING\nABOUT, HIS SPEECHES. AND I THINK THAT THAT IS OKAY.\nI MEAN, AT SOME POINT, HE HAS TO START REACHING OUT.\nI THINK THAT IF HE CAN GO TO THE INNER CITIES, IF HE CAN GO TO\nTHE BLACK CHURCHES, BY ALL MEANS, HE SHOULD.\nLOOK, I, AS A FEMALE, AND AS A WOMAN, AND AS A MINORITY, I\nMEAN, IT IS AN INSULT TO ME TO THINK THAT, AND IT'S OFFENSIVE\nTO THINK THAT I WOULD VOTE FOR HILLARY CLINTON JUST BECAUSE I'M\nA WOMAN AND BECAUSE SHE'S A WOMAN.\nAND I THINK DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS, NO VOTE SHOULD BE\nTAKEN FOR GRANTED. THESE CANDIDATES NEED TO GO OUT\nAND WORK FOR THE VOTES AND ASK FOR THE VOTES.\nYOU KNOW WHAT. IF IT'S WHAT HE'S BEEN DOING IS\nNOT WORKING AND NOW HE'S GOT A SHAKEUP IN HIS CAMPAIGN OR THE\nCHANGES, I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING.\n>> I THINK -- >> LET'S SEE WHAT IS GOING TO\nWORK. IF HE GOES OUT AND ASKS FOR IT,\nTHAT'S GOOD. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE HE IS.\nHE'S SPEAKING TO THE WORLD BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGY.\n>> BECAUSE OF CNN, RIGHT? BECAUSE WE AIRED IT.\nLET'S TALK ABOUT IT. THIS COMES ON THE HEELS OF THESE\nPOLL NUMBERS WHERE HE'S REALLY STRUGGLING IN KEY BATTLEGROUND\nSTATES. THIS COMES ON THE HEELS OF A\nNUMBER OF HEADLINES THIS WEEK THAT SAID DONALD TRUMP CANNOT\nWIN THIS ELECTION IF HE WINS EVERY SINGLE WHITE WORKING CLASS\nVOTE IN THIS COUNTRY. BY THE WAY, HE'S STRUGGLING WITH\nWHITE COLLEGE-EDUCATED VOTERS RIGHT NOW.\nRYAN, TO YOU, I WANT TO PLAY THIS MOMENT FROM BACK IN\nFEBRUARY WHEN TRUMP WAS ON WITH OUR JAKE TAPPER.\n>> THERE ARE THESE GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS ENDORSING YOU.\nWOULD YOU JUST SAY UNEQUIVOCALLY, YOU CONDEMN THEM\nAND DON'T WANT THEIR SUPPORT? >> WELL, I HAVE TO LOOK AT THE\nGROUP. I DON'T KNOW WHAT GROUP YOU'RE\nTALKING ABOUT. YOU WOULDN'T WANT ME TO CONDEMN\nA GROUP I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT. I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK.\nIF YOU WOULD SEND ME A LIST OF THE GROUPS, I WILL DO RESEARCH\nON THEM AND CERTAINLY I WOULD DISAVOW IF I THOUGHT THERE WAS\nSOMETHING WRONG. BUT YOU MAY --\n>> THE KU KLUX KLAN -- >> IT WOULD BE VERY UNFAIR, SO\nGIVE ME A LIST OF THE GROUPS. >> I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID DUKE\nAND THE KU KLUX KLAN HERE. >> I DON'T KNOW -- HONESTLY, I\nDON'T KNOW DAVID DUKE. I DON'T BELIEVE I HAVE EVER MET\nHIM. I'M PRETTY SURE I DIDN'T MEET\nHIM. DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HIM.\n>> THAT WAS THE EXCHANGE ABOUT KKK GRAND WIZARD DAVID DUKE.\nI SHOULD NOTE, TRUMP CAME OUT LATER, AS YOU KNOW, DISAVOWED\nDAVID DUKE. HOW DOES HE PUSH FOR\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS IN THE FACE OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT?\n>> YEAH, I MEAN, THAT'S -- IT'S SORT OF UNPRECEDENTED IN MODERN\nPOLITICS WHERE A POLITICIAN AT THAT LEVEL TO HEAR THE WORD KKK\nAND NOT JUST INSTANTLY BE OKAY WITH CONDEMNING IT.\nSO IT'S BEEN, YOU KNOW, HE'S GOT A VERY, VERY BLEMISHED RECORD\nWHEN IT COMES TO THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY.\nTHEN I THINK HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO DO A LOT TO GO TO THAT\nCOMMUNITY AND EXPLAIN, YOU KNOW, IN HIS EARLY DAYS IN THE REAL\nESTATE WORLD IN NEW YORK, WHY DID THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\nPENALIZE HIM FOR DISCRIMINATORY HOUSING?\nTHERE WAS A FAMOUS AD IN NEW YORK THAT HE TOOK OUT THAT A LOT\nOF PEOPLE IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY FIND, FOUND OFFENSIVE.\nFIVE TEENAGERS CONVICTED OF A CRIME THEY DIDN'T COMMIT, AND HE\nCALLED FOR THE DEATH PENALTY. A BIG CONTROVERSY, HAD ALL SORTS\nOF -- >> THEY WERE EXONERATED IN 2014.\n>> YOU KNOW THE LIST OF THESE THINGS.\nAND I'M SURE HOLLY AND HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN IS GOING TO\nPRESS THAT LIST AND RUN ADS IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY TO REMIND\nTHOSE VOTERS OF THIS HISTORY. THAT'S A LOT OF BACKAGE TO\nOVERCOME IN THAT COMMUNITY. AND WHEN HIS PITCH IS TO GO TO A\nWHITE, ALL-WHITE RALLY AND SAY, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE LIVING IN\nMISERY. YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE, VOTE\nFOR ME, I JUST -- IT DOESN'T SOUND TO ME LIKE THE MOST\nSOPHISTICATED STRATEGY IN THE WORLD.\n>> RYAN, AMY, HOLLY, MUCH MORE AHEAD WITH YOU.\nTHANK YOU FOR JOINING US. GOT TO GET A BREAK IN, BUT WE\nHAVE A LOT AHEAD THIS HOUR. TO LOUISIANA WE WILL GO.\nFLOOD-RAVAGED LOUISIANA STILL COPING WITH THE WORST NATURAL\nDISASTER IN THIS COUNTRY SINCE SUPERSTORM SANDY.\nMORE RAIN CONTINUING TO FALL AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE FAMILIES\nWAITING TO TRY TO SEE IF THEY EVEN HAVE A HOME LEFT.\n>> ALSO, A WARNING TO PREGNANT WOMEN, DO NOT GO TO PARTS OF\nMIAMI BEACH.",

HE CAN'T GO ANYWHERE BUT UP.\nI THINK HE HAS TO ASK FOR THE VOTE.\nAND THAT'S, I THINK, WHAT HE HAS STARTED DOING THIS WEEK.\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED UNDER THIS\nADMINISTRATION WHEN THERE ARE MORE LIVING IN POVERTY, MORE\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS LIVING IN POVERTY, WHEN THE MEDIAN INCOME\nHAS FALLEN, WHEN THE NUMBER OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS HAS INCREASED\nALMOST 58% TO OVER 11 MILLION ON FOOD STAMPS, WHAT HE'S SAYING\nIS, YOU KNOW, LOOK. IT'S TIME FOR CHANGE.\nTHE DEFINITION OF INSANITY IS TO CONTINUE TO DO THE SAME THING\nOVER AND OVER AGAIN AND EXPECT DIFFERENT RESULTS.\nAND IF WE LIVE WITH A HILLARY CLINTON ADMINISTRATION, THIS IS\nGOING TO BE FOUR MORE YEARS OF THE SAME FAILED POLICIES OF\nBARACK OBAMA.

HOWEVER, IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT\nOUT THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT BLACK TEENAGERS BETWEEN 16 AND 24,\nTHEIR UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS DROPPED BY MORE THAN HALF UNDER\nTHE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, FROM THE HIGH POINT DURING THE\nADMINISTRATION TO NOW. >> RIGHT.\nBUT POPPY, WHAT HE SAID WAS LAST NIGHT WHEN HE SAID WHAT THE HELL\nDO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? I THINK THAT CAN BE SAID FOR ALL\nAMERICANS. IT'S EQUIVALENT, TO I THINK WHAT\nPRESIDENT REAGAN SAID WHEN HE SAID ARE YOU BETTER OFF NOW THAN\nYOU WERE FOUR YEARS AGO?

TONIGHT I'M ASKING FOR THE VOTE\nOF EVERY SINGLE AFRICAN-AMERICAN CITIZEN IN THIS COUNTRY OF WHO\nWANTS TO SEE A BETTER FUTURE. >> DONALD TRUMP TAKING AIM AT\nHILLARY CLINTON'S RECORD AS HE MAKES A MAJOR MOVE FOR\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS. DOES HE HAVE A POINT AND WILL\nHIS WORDS BE ENOUGH TO WIN HIM SOME OF THOSE VOTES?\nJOINING USDEBATE, ASHLEY BELL AND ARIVA MARTIN.\nGREAT TO SEE YOU BOTH. DEMOCRATS HAVE LONG CRITICIZED\nREPUBLICANS FOR NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO BLACK VOTERS.\nHERE IS DONALD TRUMP MAKING AN OVERTURE, A DIRECT ONE, TO\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS AND THEY CALL HIM A RACIST FOR DOING IT.\n>> YEAH. I THINK THE PROBLEM IS -- WELL,\nTHERE ARE LOTS OF PROBLEMS WITH THE OVERTURE HE HAS MADE.\nONE, YOU START WITH WHERE HE MADE THAT APPEAL.\nTHE APPEAL WAS MADE IN BOTH OF THE MAJOR RALLIES LAST WEEK TO\nPREDOMINANTLY WHITE AUDIENCES, AND THE SECOND APPEAL MADE IN\nMICHIGAN WAS USING SOME PRETTY CONDESCENDING LANGUAGE SAYING\nYOUR SCHOOLS ARE BAD, YOU LIVE IN POVERTY, YOU HAVE NO JOBS,\nAND IF THE GOAL IS FOR DONALD TRUMP TO REACH OUT TO THE\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, HE HAS TO LISTEN TO US.\nHE HAS TO THEN APPEAL TO THOSE ISSUES AND TALK ABOUT THOSE\nISSUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO US. HE CAN'T ASK US TO VOTE FOR HIM\nBUT SURROUND HIMSELF WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE A TRACK RECORD OF\nMAKING INFLAMMATORY AND RACIST AND BIGOTED COMMENTS TOWARDS AND\nABOUT AFRICAN-AMERICAN PEOPLE. THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN IN THE\nCOMMUNITY ABOUT HOW HONEST HE IS AND HOW TRUE HE IS ABOUT THIS\nAPPEAL. WHETHER IT'S REAL OR IS THIS A\nFAKE APPEAL. >> SO ASHLEY, WHAT ABOUT HIS\nARGUMENT -- I THINK THIS IS HIS CORE AS I UNDERSTAND IT, WHICH\nIS THAT THE URBAN CORE IN AMERICA, THE CITIES, HAVE BEEN\nRUN BY DEMOCRATS FOR GENERATIONS, MORE THAN 50 YEARS\nAND THEY'RE STILL IN REALLY BAD SHAPE.\nAND SO THE FRUITS OF THE DEMOCRATS' URBAN POLICY ARE NOT\nSERVING BLACK VOTERS. DO YOU THINK THAT'S A MESSAGE\nTHAT CAN MOVE PEOPLE TO THE REPUBLICAN SIDE?\n>> ABSOLUTELY, TUCKER. HE'S RIGHT ON POINT.\nMANY TIMES WHEN YOU GO TO THESE CITIES AND YOU HAVE FAILED\nPOLICIES WHEN IT DEALS WITH EDUCATION, WHEN YOU'RE DEALING\nWITH UNEMPLOYMENT, WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH HOUSING, YOU HAVE\nVOTERS WHO NEVER VOTED FOR A REPUBLICAN, NEVER SEEN A\nREPUBLICAN. THERE'S NO REPUBLICAN TO BLAME.\nSO IF YOU NEVER VOTED FOR A REPUBLICAN AND EVERYTHING AROUND\nYOU IS CONTROLLED BY DEMOCRATS, DONALD TRUMP'S POINT IS CHANGE\nCAN ONLY -- CHANGE CAN ONLY BETTER YOUR SITUATION.\n>> RIGHT. >> WHAT SHE'S BRINGING UP IS THE\nFACT THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN ON POINT AND TALKING TO\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS AND THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANT AND WE'RE\nGETTING CRITICIZED FOR IT BUT WE'RE HAVING THAT CONVERSATION.\nDEMOCRATS ARE NOT GOING TO BACK US DOWN FOR HAVING THIS\nCONVERSATION WITH BLACK AMERICANS.\n>> WHAT SHOULD TRUMP SAY? WHAT SPECIFICALLY SHOULD HE SAY\nIN ORDER TO WIN BLACK VOTERS TO HIS CAMPAIGN?\n>> TUCKER, IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT WHAT HE SAYS.\nIT'S ABOUT WHAT HE DOES. >> I GET IT BUT --\n>> LET ME BE -- CAN I FINISH MY POINT?\nLET ME FINISH MY POINT. YOU CAN'T JUST SAY SOMETHING.\nYOU HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE YOUR WORDS.\nYOUR WORDS ONLY HAVE POWER IF THEY'RE BACKED BY YOUR ACTIONS.\n>> I AGREE. >> SO AT THE SAME TIME HE'S\nAPPEALING TO THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE, HE THEN\nPROMOTED TO THE HEAD OF HIS CAMPAIGN THE CEO OF BREITBART\nWHO HAS BEEN, YOU KNO -- HIS ONLINE REPORT WAS CALLED BY THE\nSOUTHERN POVERTY LAW GROUP A HATE WATCH REPORT.\n>> COME ON. I CAN'T LET THAT --\n>> A TRACK RECORD OF ATTACKING AFRICAN-AMERICANS.\nTHEN YOU'RE STEPPING ON YOUR OWN MESSAGE.\nHE'S STEPPING ON THE MESSAGE WHEN HE'S TRYING TO APPEAL TO US\nIF HE SURROUNDS HIMSELF BY PEOPLE THAT DON'T DEMONSTRATE\nTHAT MESSAGE. LOOK AT RUDY GIULIANI.\nRUDY IS ON TV EVERY DAY CALLING AFRICAN-AMERICANS --\n>> LET ME WEIGH IN HERE. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE DEEDS.\nSHE'S RIGHT, WHEN YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT EACH CANDIDATE\nHAS DONE AND THEIR DEEDS AND THEIR TRACK RECORD, LOOK AT THE\nCLINTON TRACK RECORD WHEN IT COMES TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS.\nNO PRESIDENCY IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY HAS INCARCERATED\nMORE PEOPLE OF COLOR THAN THE CLINTONS.\nNOBODY. WHEN YOU TRY TO LOOK AT THESE\nPOLLS RIGHT NOW, YOU HAVE THIS BOGUS POLL THAT COMES OUT SAYING\n1% OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP.\nI'LL TELL YOU A 1% POLL. THE POLL IS IF YOU ASK\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN LIE TO LAW\nENFORCEMENT AS MANY TIMES AS HILLARY CLINTON DID AND GET AWAY\nWITH IT, 99% WILL SAY THEY COULDN'T.\n>> IT WOULDN'T WORK FOR THEM. I AGREE WITH THAT.\n>> TUCKER, CAN I JUST SAY -- CAN I AGREE WITH SOMETHING ASHLEY IS\nSAYING. >> NOTHING PERSONAL, BUT WE HAVE\nA COMMERCIAL COMING UP.",

HE SAID WE'RE GOING TO BUILD\nTHAT WALL, AND THE CROWD WITH A \"USA, USA\" CHANT.\nTHERE HE IS, IN FREDERICKSBURG VIRGINIA.\nPARTWAY INTO THAT SPEECH THERE, MR. TRUMP SAID THAT HE WANTED TO\nADDRESS SOMETHING THAT'S DEEPLY PERSONAL AND OF IMPORTANCE TO\nME, I'VE ASKED THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY TO\nHONOR ME WITH THEIR VOTE. WANT TO BRING IN NOW, TO TALK\nABOUT THAT, OUR GUEST, A FORMER 2008 CLINTON CAMPAIGN ADVISER,\nFOX NEWS POLITICAL STRATEGIST AS WELL.\nAND DEANNA CALDWELL, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST, FORMER DIRECTOR OF\nAMERICAN OUTREACH FOR THE DUE PAGE COUNTY REPUBLICAN PARTY.\nGOOD TO HAVE BOTH OF YOU.

TRUMP? >> I THOUGHT EVEN AS A LIFETIME\nDEMOCRAT, I CAN SAY THAT IF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, IF THE NOMINEE\nFOR 2016 HAD FOLLOWED THE AUTOPSY AND PRESCRIPTIONS THAT\nTHE GOP LOOKED AT TO EXPAND THE PARTY, THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN\nFANTASTIC. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD FOR ALL\nAMERICANS. WHATEVER, IF YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT\nOR A REPUBLICAN. BUT INSTEAD, WHAT WE HAVE SEEN\nIN THE LAST 430-SOMETHING DAYS IS DONALD TRUMP TAPPING INTO AND\nSTOKING RACIAL ANXIETY IN THIS COUNTRY.\nAND NOW -- >> OKAY, I UNDERSTAND, WE'RE\nTIGHT ON TIME, I WANT TO GET YOUR REACTION TO MR. TRUMP'S\nSPEECH. ONE OF THE LAST THINGS HE\nADDRESSED WAS THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY.\n>> THAT'S THE THING, HE'S NOT ADDRESSING THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nCOMMUNITY -- >> THAT'S NOT TRUE.\n>> BECAUSE WHAT HE'S ACTUALLY DOING IS GOING AFTER MODERATE\nREPUBLICANS, SPECIFICALLY REPUBLICAN WOMEN WHO ARE NOT\nGOING TO BE COMFORTABLE VOTING FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS COME ACROSS\nTAPPING INTO THESE RACIAL ANXIETIES AND THEY DON'T WANT TO\nBE ALIGNED WITH ANY IDEA OF SOMEONE BEING A RACIST.\nAND SO THAT'S WHY HE'S NOT TALKING TO ROOMS OF\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS. HE'S NOT GOING INTO\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. THIS IS SPECIFICALLY TARGETED TO\nBRING BACK THOSE REPUBLICANS THAT HAVE LEFT HIM IN DROVES AND\nTHE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY SEES RIGHT THROUGH IT.\nWHEN SOMEONE TELLS YOU WHO THEY ARE, BELIEVE THEM.\n>> I'M GOING TO BRING YOU BACK BECAUSE I WANT TO TALK ON THAT\nAGAIN BUT I WANT TO BRING HIM INTO THIS DISCUSSION.\nONE OF THE THINGS MR. TRUMP SAYS IS HE WANTS THE GOP TO BE THE\nHOME OF THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTER ONCE AGAIN AND THAT HE\nWANTS A TOTALLY INCLUSIVE COUNTRY AND PARTY.\nDO YOU BELIEVE MR. TRUMP? >> I BELIEVE THAT HE DOES MEAN\nTHAT. I THINK HE'S VERY SINCERE IN\nTHAT. I THINK HE'S TAKING CORRECTIVE\nACTION. THE AUTOPSY REPORT PUT OUT BY\nTHE RNC IS AN IMPORTANT DOCUMENT IN WHICH REPUBLICANS SHOULD BE\nFOLLOWING. I THINK NOW THAT IT'S THREE\nWEEKS OUT OF THE CONVENTION, WE'RE SEEING THE ACTIONS AND THE\nRESOURCES PUT IN PLACE AT THE RNC AS WELL AS MR. TRUMP'S\nCAMPAIGN TO REALLY TACKLE THESE VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES.\nI THINK MR. TRUMP HAS DONE A GREAT JOB IN TERMS OF NOW\nGETTING OUT THERE AND MAKING ITS APPEAL TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS.\nTHE MILWAUKEE SPEECH, THE WISCONSIN SPEECH BEING ONE OF\nTHEM. THINK THE FACT HE IS APOLOGIZING\nFOR SOME OF THE STATEMENTS IN WHICH HE HAS MADE THAT'S CAUSED\nPAIN IS ALSO A HELPFUL STEP. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE MY INITIAL\nSTEP WAS MR. TRUMP, WE CAN AGRE PARTY MORE TIMES THAN NOT GO AND\nASK THE BLACK COMMUNITY FOR THEIR VOTE AND THEY GET NOTHING\nOUT OF IT. THAT'S A KNOWN FACT COMMUNITY\nWITHIN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY.\nNOW THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT -- >> COMING UP TO A HARD BREAK,\nSORRY. I'LL GET YOU BACK AFTER THE\nBREAK TO CONTINUE YOUR THOUGHT.

I'M TALKING ABOUT THE VENUES.\nAND WHAT CONCERN MUST MR.

WHY HE SUPPORTED IN HIS CAM PAIN\nTO GET THE NOMINATION. AND WHY WHEN HE WAS CAUGHT\nDISCRIMINATING AGAINST RENTING TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND SETTLED\nWITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, A FEW YEARS LATER, LOOKED AROUND\nAND THOUGHT NO ONE WAS WATCHING HIM AND SO HE THE SAME THING\nAGAIN.

IN FACT A LITTLE BIT HIGH IN\nSOME STATES LIKE IOWA FOR EXAMPLE.\nTHE FOCUS IS THAT IT'S HARD TO REACH MINORITY VOTERS ON THE\nPHONE, HARD TO REACH YOUNGER VOTERS ON THE PHONE, YOU CAN\nFIND VARIOUS WAYS TO ADJUST FOR THAT.\nBUT THERE HAVE BEEN IN PRESIDENTIAL YEARS UNDERCOUNTING\nOF DEMOCRATS INSTEAD OF REPUBLICANS.\n>> SO YOU'RE SAYING IF THERE'S A HIDDEN TRUMP VOTE, THERE COULD\nBE A HIDDEN CLINTON VOTE AS WELL?\n>> ON ELECTION DAY, IT COULD BE CLINTON PLUS ONE, IT COULD ALSO\nBE CLINTON PLUS EIGHT. >> SO THERE'S A MARGIN OF ERROR\nIN EVERY POLL? >> SOMETIMES THE POLL DO NOT PEG\nOR TURN OUT RIGHT. FOR EXAMPLE SOMETHING LAST\nMINUTE MIGHT SHIFT. I THINK TRUMP CAN WIN THIS\nELECTION, OUR MODELS DO TOO. I ALSO THINK IT'S WORSE FOR\nCLINTON. >> YOU WERE A FAMOUS TRUMP\nSKEPTIC IN THE PRIMARIES, YOU HAVE ADMITTED YOU WERE WRONG IN\nSOME WAYS, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO RESET YOUR OPINION IN THE FALL?\n>> IN SOME WAYS JUST TAKING THE POLLS AT FACE VALUE AND NOT\nTRYING TO OVERTHINK THEM.

IRONICALLY THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN\nLOOKS SO SMART BY TOUTING THE POLLS IN THE PRIMARIES AND NOW\nTHEY'RE DENYING THE VERY SAME DATA POINTS THAT MADE FRANKLY A\nLOT OF PEOPLE LIKE ME LOOK FOOLISH BACK IN THE SPRING.\n>> BOTTOM LINE, WHEN WE SEE TRUMP SUPPORTERS AND TRUMP\nSPOKES PEOPLE QUOTING THE L.A.

THE FEDERAL RESPONSE AND\nSUPPLIES, ET CETERA, TO LOUISIANA RIGHT NOW IS NOT\nWHAT'S BEEN CRITICIZED, IT'S THE OPTICS.\n>> RIGHT. IT'S INEVITABLE THAT THE OPTICS\nGET CRITICIZED. IT OFTEN HAPPENS IN THE SUMMER\nMONTHS, WHEN THE PRESIDENT IS AWAY, IT'S GOING TO BE A\nCRITICISM. THAT SAID, THE HEART OF THE\nKATRINA ISSUE WASN'T THAT PHOTO. THE HEART WAS THE INADEQUATE\nRESPONSE AND THE WAY IN WHICH FEMA HAD BEEN GUTTED IN PREVIOUS\nYEARS BECAUSE OF CUTS AND POOR STAFFING.\nRIGHT NOW THAT'S NOT THE CRITICISM.\nOBAMA AND THE ADMINISTRATION STILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO\nSHOW A FORCEFUL RESPONSIBILITY TO THE CRISIS AND HELP CLEAN\nTHIS UP. >> IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT\nTHE GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA ACTUALLY ASKED THAT THE\nPRESIDENT WAIT TO COME, BECAUSE WHENEVER A PRESIDENT COMES,\nESPECIALLY A SITTING PRESIDENT, A LOT OF RESOURCES GET DIVERTED\nFROM THE CLEANUP. AT THE SAME TIME, THE WHITE\nHOUSE ANNOUNCED THE PRESIDENT WILL BE GOING ON TUESDAY, AFTER\nDONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE LANDED THERE.\n>> RIGHT. IT'S OFTEN THE CASE, AND THIS\nWAS ALSO THE CASE WITH PRESIDENT BUSH, THAT THE WHITE HOUSE FEELS\nTHEIR PRESENCE THERE WILL ONLY CREATE MORE PROBLEMS.\nIT'S A HUGE THING FOR A PRESIDENT TO COME INTO ANY PLACE\nIN THE COUNTRY. BUT TO DO THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF\nA CRISIS MAKES THINGS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT.\nBUT THE TIMING, AGAIN, WHETHER IT'S FAIR OR NOT, BECOMES AN\nISSUE. SO IT LOOKS LIKE THE PRESIDENT\nIS RESPONDING TO THE CRITICS. >> WHAT ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON?\nWHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE OPTICS AND THE ACTION IN TERMS OF SHE\nSPOKE TO THE GOVERNOR, SHE ISSUES THIS STATEMENT ON\nFACEBOOK, CALLS IN EVERYONE TO HELP, GIVE MONEY TO THE RED\nCROSS, DO WHAT YOU CAN. SHE'S NOT PLANNING TO GO, AS FAR\nAS WE KNOW, YET. >> WE'LL SEE IF SHE CHANGES HER\nMIND AND GOES. AGAIN, I THINK WHAT MOST PEOPLE\nARE LOOKING FOR, WHAT ARE THE SOLUTIONS, WHAT ARE THE\nCANDIDATES OFFERING. SOME MIGHT THINK DONALD TRUMP\nBEING THERE AND HANDING THINGS OUT IS GOOD, IT'S MORE\nEFFECTIVE, BUT IN THE END, A LOT OF PEOPLE FROM LOUISIANA WANT\nRELIEF. THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR.\n>> THEY GET SOME RELIEF FROM FUNDING AND MONEY THAT COMES\nWHEN THE TELEVISION CAMERAS ARE THERE, WHICH COMES WHEN A\nPRESIDENT OR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IS THERE.\nDONALD TRUMP CAME AND GAVE OUT SUPPLIES WHICH IS GREAT, BUT HE\nCOULD HAVE SAID NOTHING POLITICAL.\nINSTEAD THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN HE SAID POLITICAL THINGS, LIKE\nYOU JUST HEARD AT THE BEGINNING, \"THE PRESIDENT SHOULD BE HERE.\"\nDID THAT MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A PHOTO OP?\n>> MOST PEOPLE ARE CONVINCED, WHEN THE PRESIDENT, WHEN A\nCANDIDATE GOES, ANYONE POLITICAL GOES INTO A CRISIS AREA LIKE\nTHIS, POLITICS IS ON THEIR MIND. CERTAINLY TRUMP'S COMMENTS\nDIDN'T HELP. AT THE SAME TIME PRESIDENT OBAMA\nIS SAVVY ENOUGH TO REALIZE IMAGES OF HIM GOLFING ON\nMARTHA'S VINEYARD COMBINED WITH THE CRISIS IMAGES DON'T LOOK\nGOOD AND IT DOESN'T HELP HILLARY CLINTON.\nYOU CAN'T EXTRACT THE POLITICS FROM A CRISIS LIKE THIS.\n>> JULIAN ZELIZER, THANK YOU SO MUCH, IMPORTANT PERSPECTIVE, WE\nAPPRECIATE IT. MOST IMPORTANTLY, BEYOND THE\nPOLITICS, HOW DO YOU HELP THE VIC\nVICTIMS? 40,000 HOMES DAMAGED.\nIF YOU WANT TO HELP, GO TO CNN.COM/IMPACT.\nEVERY LITTLE BIT COUNTS.",

THAT'S NOT WHAT'S BEING\nCRITICIZED. I SPOKE TO THE HEAD OF FEMA WHO\nWAS DOWN THERE WITH THE PRESIDENT ON WEDNESDAY.\nDOES THAT MATTER IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION?\n>> I THINK IT DOES A LITTLE. BUT THE REALITY IS, IS THAT THE\nWHITE HOUSE HAD NO PLANS TO GO THERE UNTIL TRUMP WAS THERE\nYESTERDAY. >> WE DON'T KNOW THAT.\nTHEY HAVEN'T SAID THAT. >> THEY HAVEN'T SAID THAT,\nTHAT'S TRUE.

EVEN IN A TWEET OR A FACEBOOK\nPOST OR A VIDEO SO HE'S ON THE RECORD TALKING ABOUT IT.\n>> TO BE FAIR, BRIAN, THERE WAS A LOT OF CRITICISM OF THE\nNATIONAL MEDIA INCLUDED FOR THE COVERAGE, BECAUSE IT DIDN'T COME\nON WITH A BANG LIKE A HURRICANE AND A LOT OF LOCAL MEDIA SAID\nWHERE ARE YOU GUYS IN COUGHING THIS?\n>> IT GETS TO ISSUE OF FLOODING. HE IS A NO NAME STORM.\nIT DIDN'T HAVE A NAME LIKE SUPERSTORM SANDY OR HURRICANE\nKICK. IT DID CATCH THE NATIONAL NEWS\nOUTLETS. I WILL TALK TO AN EXPERT\nMETEOROLOGIST ABOUT WHY IT DIDN'T GET EARLY COVERAGE.\nONCE THE PRESS DID PAY NOR ATTENTION, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN\nMADE SENSE FOR THE PRESIDENT TO BAY WEIGH IN, IN SOME FASHION,\nESPECIALLY THAT HE'S ON VACATION OUT GOLFING.\n>> YOU WERE ON THE GROUND WITH VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY IN\nLOUISIANA, YOU KNOW, BACK WITH HURRICANE KATRINA.\nIF ARE YOU IN HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMP, YOU HAVE SPOKEN TO THE\nGOVERNOR, YOU HAVE SAID, WE'LL DO WHATEVER WE NEED TO HELP.\nDOES HILLARY CLINTON NOW GO OR DOES THAT LOOK LIKE SHE IS\nFOLLOWING TRUMP? >> I THINK SHE SHOULD MAKE A\nPUBLIC STATEMENT SOMEWHERE.

LOTS OF TIME, LOTS OF ENERGY\nSPENDING MY MONEY, BUT I'M FIGHTING FOR YOU.\nFIGHTING FOR YOU. HILLARY CLINTON IS A THROWBACK\nFROM YESTERDAY. OUR CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT CREATING A\nNEW AMERICAN FUTURE. I'M NOT A POLITICIAN.\nTHANK GOODNESS. I HAVE NO SPECIAL INTERESTS AND\nI HAVE NO SPECIAL INTERESTS TELLING ME WHAT TO DO.\nI HAVE NO DONORS TELLING ME WHAT TO DO.\nI'M MY DONOR.

I'M RUNNING TO REPRESENT THE\nGREAT MAJORITY OF AMERICANS. REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS,\nINDEPENDENTS, LIBERALS, CONSERVATIVES WHO TURN ON\nTELEVISION EVERY NIGHT AND DON'T SEE ANYONE SPEAKING UP FOR THEM.\nTHE FORGOTTEN MAN. THE FORGOTTEN WOMAN.\nTHIS CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT GIVING A VOICE TO THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE\nONE, I AM YOUR VOICE. I AM YOUR VOICE.\nI UNDERSTAND THE GREAT RESPONSIBILITY YOU HAVE AND\nESPECIALLY THE RESPONSIBILITY YOU'VE PLACED IN ME AND I WILL\nNEVER, EVER LET YOU DOWN. ONCE AGAIN, IT WILL BE A\nGOVERNMENT OF, BY, AND FOR THE PEOPLE. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT MY REFORM\nAGENDA WILL MEAN FOR THE CITIZENS OF VIRGINIA.\nAND I HAVE TO SAY, I LOVE THIS STATE.\nI HAVE BUSINESSES IN THIS STATE. THEY'RE GREAT BUSINESSES.\nAND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THIS STATE AND WE'RE GOING TO\nTAKE CARE OF THIS COUNTRY. BUT FIRST, LET'S TALK ABOUT OUR\nAMAZING VETERANS. VETERANS.\nTHE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA IS HOME TO ABOUT 800,000 VETERANS\nWHO HAVE SERVED BRAVELY OUR COUNTRY.\nTO ALL VETERANS HERE TONIGHT AND ACROSS THIS NATION, THANK YOU\nVERY MUCH. THANK YOU, THANK YOU.\nWE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN. WE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN.\nGOVERNMENT IS LETTING YOU DOWN VERY BADLY RIGHT NOW.\nWE ARE NEVER, EVER GOING TO LET OUR GREAT VETERANS DOWN.\nTHE OBAMA/CLINTON ADMINISTRATION HAS BETRAYED OUR VETERANS AND\nIT'S BETRAYED THEM VERY BADLY. VETERANS ARE DYING WAITING FOR\nSIMPLE CARE. THEY'RE DYING ONLINE WAITING TO\nSEE A DOCTOR. FIVE DAYS, SIX DAYS, SEVEN DAYS.\nIT ALL ENDS, AND IT ENDS FAST UNDER A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.\nI HAVE A DETAILED 10 POINT PLAN ON VETERANS REFORM AVAILABLE ON\nMY WEB SITE, WHICH EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT, AND THE VETERANS\nLOVE. CHECK IT OUT.\nAT THE CENTER OF THE PLAN IS VETERANS' CHOICE.\nTHE V.A. WILL REMAIN A PUBLIC SYSTEM BECAUSE IT IS REALLY, A\nPUBLIC TRUST. BUT VETERANS WILL HAVE THE RIGHT\nTO EITHER SEEK CARE AT THE V.A. FACILITY AND IF THEY CAN'T GET\nIT AND GET IT QUICKLY, THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO GO TO A PRIVATE\nDOCTOR OR MEDICAL CLINIC ACROSS THE STREET AND WE'LL TAKE CARE\nOF IT. NEVER AGAIN WILL WE ALLOW A\nVETERAN TO DIE WAITING FOR THE CARE THAT THEY NEED AND THEY\nSHOULD BE GETTING MORE THAN ANYBODY.\nA TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WILL ALSO REBUILD OUR SADLY DEPLETED\nMILITARY. SADLY DEPLETED.\nTHE BEST WAY TO KEEP OUR TROOPS OUT OF HARM'S WAY AND TO KEEP\nOUR NATION OUT OF PREVENTABLE CONFLICTS IS TO REMEMBER THOSE\nFAMOUS WORDS, VERY, VERY FAMOUS WORDS, PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH.\nUNFORTUNATELY, OUR ACTIVE DUTY ARMED FORCES HAVE SHRUNK FROM 2\nMILLION IN 1991 TO 1.3 MILLION TODAY, A BIG, BIG REDUCTION.\nTHE NAVY HAS SHRUNK FROM OVER 500 SHIPS TO 272 SHIPS DURING\nTHE SAME PERIOD OF TIME. THINK OF THAT.\nSO SAD. THE AIR FORCE IS ABOUT ONE-THIRD\nSMALLER THAN IT WAS IN 1991. PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS PROPOSED A\n2017 DEFENSE BUDGET THAT IN REAL DOLLARS CUTS NEARLY 25% FROM\nWHAT WE WERE SPENDING IN 2011. WE FACE THREATS AS NEVER, EVER\nBEFORE BUT THE OBAMA/CLINTON ADMINISTRATION IS DETERMINED TO\nKEEP SHRINKING OUR MILITARY UNTIL YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY IS\nGOING TO HAPPEN AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE GOOD.\nTHAT I CAN TELL YOU. PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS SAID THAT HE\nTHINKS THE GREATEST THREAT WE FACE IS GLOBAL WARMING.\nREMEMBER, PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HILLARY CLINTON SOMETIMES REFER\nTO AS CROOKED HILLARY, CAN'T EVEN SAY THE WORDS RADICAL\nISLAMIC TERRORISM. CAN'T EVEN SAY IT.\nTHEY DON'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT'S\nHAPPENING. THEY CAN'T SAY THE WORDS.\nNOW, WHILE PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HILLARY CLINTON ARE SHRINKING\nAMERICA'S MILITARY, THEY'RE ALSO EXPANDING, THINK OF IT,\nEXPANDING THROUGH ALLOWING IT TO HAPPEN, THE MILITARY OF IRAN.\nTHEY'RE DOING THIS WITH A DISASTROUS DEAL THAT PUTS IRAN\nON THE PATH TO NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND GIVES THEM ANOTHER $150\nBILLION NOT TO MENTION THE $400 MILLION IN CASH WHICH TURNED OUT\nTO BE A RANSOM PAYMENT AFTER ALL.\nJUST LIKE I SAID. IN OTHER WORDS, OUR PRESIDENT\nLIED TO US. HE LIED TO US.\nBUT LET'S ALSO NOT FORGET THAT HILLARY CLINTON'S DISASTROUS\nMIDDLE EAST POLICIES UNLEASHED ISIS ON TO THE WORLD.\nA FACT FOR WHICH HILLARY CLINTON HAS EXPRESSED ZERO REMORSE AND\nNO APOLOGIES.",

NO DEBT ON HIS CAMPAIGN BOOKS.\nLET'S TALK ABOUT THIS WITH LILY GARCIA.\nSHE'S THE PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION.\nALSO JACK KINGSTON, SENIOR ADVISOR TO THE TRUMP COMPANY AND\nFORMER CONGRESSMAN FROM GEORGIA. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE NUMBERS,\nJUST THE HEADLINES HERE. $58 MILLION COMING IN JULY TO\nTHE CLINTON COMPANY, ABOUT 38 TO TRUMP.\nDONALD TRUMP IS THE CANDIDATE WHO HAS MORE GROUND TO MAKE UP.\nIT APPEARS HE HAS LESS MONEY TO DO IT.\nHOW DOES HE EITHER MAKE UP ENOUGH MONEY TO FIGHT ON THE\nFIELD THAT CLINTON HAS SET, OR DOES HE DO IT WITH MUCH LESS IN\nA DIFFERENT WAY? >> I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE\nTO DO IT WITH MUCH LESS. WE DON'T HAVE THE WALL STREET\nMONEY. WE DON'T HAVE THE BIG SPECIAL\nINTEREST GROUPS THAT ARE FUNDING HILLARY'S CAMPAIGN AND HAVE\nFUNDED HER ENTIRE POLITICAL CAREER.\nOUR DONATIONS ARE A LOT SMALLER, MORE GRASSROOTS.\nHE WON THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY BASICALLY ON EARNED MEDIA.\nYOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT IN THE GENERAL ELECTION.\nBUT STILL DONALD TRUMP IS SOMEBODY WHO AT HIS RALLIES GETS\n15,000 PEOPLE. HILLARY CLINTON GETS 3,000\nPEOPLE. HER OVER HEAD IS A LOT MORE.\nSHE HAS 700 PAID EMPLOYEES. WE ARE A MUCH MORE NIMBLE,\nGRASSROOTS ORGANIZATION. WE HAVE TO BE.\nBUT OUR FUND-RAISING, OUR TOTAL NUMBERS IN JULY WAS ABOUT $82\nMILLION. PART OF THAT WAS WITHCOMMITTEE.\nWE'RE RAISING MONEY NOW. THIS WEEKEND WE'VE SEEN DONALD\nTRUMP HAS BEEN IN NORTH CAROLINA.\nHE'S BEEN IN FREDERICKSBURG, VIRGINIA.\nHILLARY CLINTON I THINK HAS BEEN ON MARTHA'S VINEYARD, NOT GOING\nOUT AND SEEING THE PEOPLE, BUT FUND-RAISING.\nTHERE IS A DIFFERENT STYLE AND DIFFERENT APPROACH.\n>> WE'LL GET TO THAT DIFFERENT STYLE IN A MOMENT.\nLET ME COME TO YOU. AS THE CONGRESSMAN BROUGHT UP\nTHIS POINT, MUCH DEEPER PAYROLL, MUCH LARGER ORGANIZATION, HER\nBURN RATE HIGHER THAN DONALD TRUMP'S.\nIS SHE SPENDING TOO MUCH MONEY? >> DONALD TRUMP CAN'T MAKE UP\nTHIS GROUND, BECAUSE HE HAS NO GROUND GAME.\nSHE DOES. SHE HAS THE MOST AMAZING TEAM.\nSHE HAS THE MOST AMAZING VOLUNTEERS THAT ARE OUT THERE\nKNOCKING DOORS. A LOT OF THEM ARE EDUCATORS.\nI REPRESENT 3 MILLION EDUCATORS THAT WORK IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS,\nCOLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. WE KNOW WHAT'S AT STAKE HERE.\nAND THE WHOLE INTERESTING PHENOMENON ABOUT RALLIES, THE\nKIND OF MEDIA ATTENTION THAT DONALD TRUMP IS GETTING FROM THE\nTHINGS HE'S SAYING AT RALLIES IS NOT RESONATING WITH THE PUBLIC.\nYOU CAN TAKE A LOOK AT ANY POLLS, IN FACT ALL OF THEM.\nAND WHAT GETS APPLAUSE LINES AT A RALLY IS THE LAUGH LINE WITH\nTHE REST OF THE PUBLIC. THEY'RE NOT BUYING WHAT HE SAYS.\n>> THE SUGGEST IS THE FREE MEDIA HERE IS NOT HELPING DONALD\nTRUMP. >> ABSOLUTELY NOT.\nI THINK WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THE POLLS AND SEE THIS.\n>> LET ME PLAY THIS AD THAT CAME OUT FROM THE RNC ABOUT HILLARY\nCLINTON. THEN WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT ON THE\nOTHER SIDE. >> WELCOME ABOARD HILLARY\nCLINTON'S LIBERAL ELITE SUMMER TOUR, WITH FREQUENT STOPS IN\nBEVERLY HILLS, HOLLYWOOD AND CAPE COD.\nPLEASE USE CAUTION WHEN OPENING THE OVER HEAD BINS AS HILLARY'S\nBAGGAGE BAGGAGE MAY HAVE SHIFTED DURING\nFLIGHT. >> IT'S WHERE HILLARY CLINTON IS\nRAISING HER MONEY THAT THE DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN BELIEVES\nCOULD BE AN INROAD INTO SOME OF THOSE VOTERS THAT DONALD TRUMP'S\nTRYING TO ATTRACT. >> SHE'S GOT SMALL DONORS, LARGE\nDONORS, SHE'S GOT PEOPLE WHO ARE INVESTING IN A FUTURE THAT WE\nBELIEVE IN. WE BELIEVE IN THINGS LIKE PUBLIC\nEDUCATION AND PUBLIC SERVICES. THAT'S WHY WE'VE GOT PEOPLE ALL\nOVER THE COUNTRY WILLING TO WALK NEIGHBORHOODS AND DO WHATEVER IT\nTAKES TO MAKE SURE SHE GETS ELECTED.\nI THINK THEY HAVE TO SHIFT THE DISCUSSION.\nTHEY HAVE TO GET PEOPLE TO, LIKE ON THAT AD, STOP ACTUALLY ASKING\nABOUT ISSUES. BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE\nISSUES, SHE'S GOT PLANS AND HE'S GOT SLOGANS.\nHE'S GOT NOTHING. >> THE ARGUMENT IS THAT WHERE\nHILLARY CLINTON IS GOING TO GET HER MONEY IS FROM THE ELITES ON\nTHE EAST COAST AND THE WEST COAST.\n>> AND EVERYONE IN BETWEEN. SHE HAS BEEN RAISING MONEY FROM\nPEOPLE WHO REALLY WANT SOMETHING BETTER FOR AMERICA.\nTHAT'S WHY THEY'RE DONATING. >> WE NEED TO TAKE A QUICK\nBREAK.",

TRUMP DID BOAST $80 MILLION FOR\nTHE MONTH OF JULY BUT THAT MONEY IS NOT BEING SPENT AND ALLOCATED\nTHE SAME WAY THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS SPENDING IT.\nMONEY COMES IN THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN, SHE SPENDS IT,\nPARTICULARLY ON THESE ADS. YOU'VE SEEN A LOT OF NEGATIVE\nADS AGAINST DONALD TRUMP BUT SOME OF THE MONEY COMING IN FOR\nTRUMP IS ALSO COMING IN THROUGH THE RNC.\nSO SOME OF THAT MONEY HAS TO BE SPENT ON THE RNC AND ITS\nEXPENSES. EVEN IF IT'S A BIG BLOCKBUSTER\nJULY, ALL OF THAT MONEY IS NOT BEING SPENT ON WHAT HE NEEDS,\nGROUNDWORK, ORGANIZATION, AND THE NEGATIVE ADS.\n>> TEN WEEKS LEFT AND WE'VE SEEN SEEING BILLBOARDS POPPING UP IN\nSTATES LIKE CALIFORNIA PAID FOR BY THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND IN\nVIRGINIA WHERE HE'S DOWN BY 11 POINTS.\nIS THAT A GOOD MARSHALING OF THE MONEY BY THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN?\n>> THIS IS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE PARTY NOT BEING ALL IN\nON TRUMP RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THAT IS GETTING IN THE WAY HERE\nBECAUSE SOME OF THE MONEY IS GOING TOWARD, LIKE I SAID, RNC\nEXPENSES.

WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT\nHORRIFIC FLOODING GOING ON FOR A WEEK NOW IN LOUISIANA.\nDONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE TOURED THE DAMAGE IN BATON ROUGE\nYESTERDAY. THE GOP CANDIDATES MET WITH\nFLOOD VICTIMS, FAITH LEADERS AND MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL GUARD.\nTHEY GAVE OUT SUPPLIES TO MANY PEOPLE IN LEAD.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA HAS BEEN CRITICIZED BY SOME FOR NOT\nCUTTING HIS VACATION SHORT TO VISIT LOUISIANA.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE DID ANNOUNCE YESTERDAY THE PRESIDENT WILL GO\nTO THE FLOOD ZONE ON TUESDAY. THINK ABOUT THESE NUMBERS FOR A\nMOMENT. LOUISIANA HAS RECEIVED NEARL LY\nTRILLION GALLONS OF RAINFALL IN JUST A WEEK.\n13 PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN THE FLOODS.\nTENS OF THOUSANDS HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THEIR HOMES.\nDAMAGES, AT LEAST, AT LEAST REACHING $30 MILLION IF NOT FAR,\nFAR MORE. OUR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT IS\nWITH ME FROM ASCENSION PARISH. YOU HAVE 40,000 HOMES THAT HAVE\nBEEN DAMAGED AT LEAST. MANY WILL NOT BE RECOVERED.\nYOU HAVE ONLY 12% OF FOLKS WHO LIVE THERE THAT HAVE FLOOD\nINSURANCE. WHAT ARE THEY SAYING TO YOU\nABOUT GOING HOME, SEEING IF THEY HAVE A HOME, HOW THEY REBUILD?\n>> YOU KNOW, THAT LEANP WILL HAPPEN AS SOON AS THESE WATERS\nCONTINUE TO RECEDE. AND OF COURSE, WHEN SOME OF THAT\nRAIN CONTINUES TO MOVE ON. JUST A FEW MOMENTS AGO, THERE\nWAS ONE OF THOSE DOWNPOURS THAT REALLY DOES ADD INSULT TO\nINJURY, WHEN PEOPLE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS, YES, THERE ARE SOME\nNEIGHBORHOODS NORTH OF WHERE WE ARE THAT HAVE DRIED OUT, IF YOU\nCAN ALMOST CALL THEM THE LUCKY ONES, IF YOU WILL, BECAUSE\nTHEY'RE ACTUALLY ABLE TO GO INSIDE THEIR HOMES AND ASSESS\nTHE DAMAGE, SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING THEY CAN ACTUALLY\nSALVAGE. THEN YOU HAVE THOSE THAT ARE\nSTILL DEALING WITH THESE SCENES HERE, NOT ABLE TO MAKE IT IN\nTHEIR HOMES QUITE YET, INCLUDING ONE WOMAN THAT WE MET ON THIS\nVERY SPOT A SHORT WHILE AGO NAMED ELLIE STEVEN.\nJUST DOWN THE ROAD, SHE ACTUALLY RAISED HER FAMILY THERE.\nHOWEVER, SHE HAS HAD TO WAIT -- SHE CONTINUES TO WAIT TO\nACTUALLY GO INSIDE AND FIND OUT WHAT'S LEFT OF HER HOME.\nI TALKED TO HER A LITTLE WHILE AGO.\nTHAT SMILE THAT SHE WORKED SO HARD TO KEEP ON HER FACE, IT DID\nLEAVE FOR JUST A FEW MOMENTS AS SHE FACED REALITY THAT IT MAY BE\nA WHILE BEFORE SHE MAKES IT BACK INTO HER HOME.\nSTANDING HERE, YOU'RE SO CLOSE, BUT YET YOU CAN'T GO YET.\n>> I CAN'T GO. I WAS TRYING, REALLY, TO SEE IF\nI COULD GO TODAY TO REALLY SEE WHAT THE DAMAGES ARE.\nBUT THE WATER IS STILL THERE. YOU KNOW, AND MIGHT NOT BE ABLE\nTO GO IN TODAY AS WELL. >> EMOTIONALLY, HOW IS IT BEING\nSO CLOSE AND NOT BEING ABLE TO GO.\nHOW IS THAT FOR YOU? >> WELL -- THAT'S WHAT I DIDN'T\nWANT TO DO. IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.\n>> IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY. THAT IS HER MESSAGE TO NOT ONLY\nTHE REST OF HER COMMUNITY, HER NEIGHBORS, BUT ALSO THE REST OF\nTHE COUNTRY AS PEOPLE CONTINUE TO PICK UP THE PIECES.\nTHERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF HOPE HERE, BUT THERE IS A NEED FOR\nSUPPLIES. CLEANING SUPPLIES, WATER, FOOD,\nONE NATIONAL GUARDSMAN TOLD ME THAT THE DEMAND FOR FOOD AND\nWATER, THOSE KINDS OF THINGS, IS JUST AS GREAT AS WHAT WE SAW IN\nHURRICANE KATRINA. >> ABSOLUTELY.\nI'LL POINT PEOPLE TO IT IN A MOMENT, BUT AGAIN, WE HAVE WAYS\nYOU CAN HELP.  >> DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE\nCAME YESTERDAY, HANDED OUT SUPPLIES.\nTHEY HAD BEEN WARNED BY THE GOVERNOR DON'T JUST COME FOR A\nPHOTO OP. HELP US.\nHILLARY CLINTON HASN'T GONE. SHE HAS CALLED THE GOVERNOR AND\nOFFERED ASSISTANCE. THE PRESIDENT WILL GO ON\nTUESDAY. WHAT'S THE SENSE DOWN THERE FROM\nFOLKS? DO THEY CARE ABOUT THE POLITICS\nOF IT? DO THEY WANT THE PRESIDENT\nTHERE? WHAT ARE THEY SAYING?\n>> YEAH, IT'S A GOOD QUESTION. YOU'LL FIND MIXED REACTION.\nTHERE ARE SOME INDIVIDUALS INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR WHO FEAR\nSOME OF THE VISITS COULD REMOVE SOME OF THESE RESOURCES.\nANYTIME YOU HAVE TO SECURE A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OR THE\nPRDZ HIMSELF, YES, THERE IS A DIVERSION OF SOME OF THESE\nRESOURCES. THEN YOU HAVE OTHERS WHO HAVE\nTOLD ME THEY WELCOME ANY OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MORE OF\nTHEIR STORIES AND ANYWHERE THE PRESIDENT GOES, THE SPOTLIGHT\nDOES FOLLOW HIM. IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE REST\nOF THE WORLD TO SEE WHAT PEOPLE ARE DEALING WITH SEVEN DAYS\nAFTER THE FIRST RAINS STARTED TO FALL.\n>> ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE APPRECIATE IT.\nLIVE IN BATON ROUGE FOR US. FOR WAYS YOU CAN HELP THE\nVICTIMS OF THE FLOODING, AS WE JUST SAID, GO TO CNN.COM/IMPACT.\nAGAIN, C NRX NRXCNN.COM/IMPACT. >> COMING UP, THE CDC IS\nSOUNDING THE ALARM ON ZIKA, TELLING PREGNANT WOMEN NOT TO\nTRAVEL IN PARTS OF MIAMI BEACH AFTER LOCAL TRANSMISSION OF THE\nDISEASE WAS CONFIRMED THERE.

AFTER A CAMPAIGN SHAKEUP, DONALD\nTRUMP LAST NIGHT MADE A FRESH PITCH TO \u00e2\u0096\u00a0MINORITYOTERS.\n>> THE GOP IS THE PARTY OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN.\nAND I WANT OUR PARTY TO BE THE HOME OF THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nVOTER ONCE AGAIN. >> TRUMP ALSO CONVENES SOME OF\nHIS HISPANIC SUPPORTERS AT TRUMP TOWER.\nA REPORT BY UNIVISION SAYS HE TOLD PEOPLE IN THE ROOM HE WOULD\nROLL OUT A PLAN TO LEGALIZE MILLIONS OF UNDOCUMENTED\nIMMIGRANTS. THAT WOULD, OF COURSE, BE A\nMAJOR REVERSAL FROM HIS CALL IN THE PRIMARY TO DEPORT ALL\nESTIMATED 11 MILLION. UNIVISION, THE SPANISH LANGUAGE\nNETWORK THAT'S BATTLED WITH TRUMP REPORTS TRUMP SAID HE\nREGRETTED HIS PREVIOUS COMMENTS ABOUT MEXICANS.\nSO WHAT REALLY HAPPENED AT THE MEETING?\nJOINING ME NOW IS DONALD TRUMP'S NEWLY MINTED CAMPAIGN MANAGER\nKELLYANNE CONWAY. SO LET ME GET SOME CLARITY SINCE\nYOU WERE AT THIS MEETING. DOES DONALD TRUMP STILL SUPPORT\nSETTING UP A DEPORTATION FORCE AND REMOVING THE 11 MILLION OR\nESTIMATED 11 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS FROM\nAMERICA? YES OR NO?\n>> WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAID YESTERDAY IN THAT MEETING\nDIFFERED VERY LITTLE FROM WHAT HE'S SAID PUBLICLY, INCLUDING IN\nHIS CONVENTION SPEECH LAST MONTH IN CLEVELAND.\nIT'S THAT WE NEED A, QUOTE, FAIR A HUMANE WAY OF DEALING WITH\nWHAT IS ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT 11 MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN\nTHIS COUNTRY. THAT WAS PART OF THE DISCUSSION.\nIT WAS A ROBUST DISCUSSION. I HAVE SEEN HIM VERY ANIMATED IN\nMEETINGS LIKE THIS WHERE HE IS LEARNING, TAKING NOTES, ASKING\nQUESTIONS AND HE IS RECEIVING INFORMATION.\nTHE REST OF THE CONVERSATION FRANKLY WAS ABOUT JOB CREATION,\nECONOMIC REVITALIZATION. THE FACT THAT SMALL BUSINESS\nGROWTH AMONG HISPANIC AND LATINO AMERICANS IS ON THE RISE.\nWE TALKED ABOUT THE INABILITY TO GET ACCESS TO CAPITAL.\nFOR MANY OF THEM. WE TALKED ABOUT HOME OWNERSHIP\nAS BEING VERY IMPORTANT. RELIGION AND FAMILY BEING VERY\nIMPORTANT TO HISPANICS. IT WAS A LONG AND FAR-REACHING\nCONVERSATION. NOTHING WAS SAID YESTERDAY THAT\nDIFFERS FROM WHAT MR. TRUMP SAID PREVIOUSLY.\n>> LET ME PLAY SOMETHING FROM WHAT MR. TRUMP SAID PREVIOUSLY.\nLISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID IN NOVEMBER.\n>> WE'LL HAVE A DEPORTATION FORCE.\nYOU DO IT HUMANELY. >> ARE THEY RIPPED OUT OF THEIR\nHOMES? >> THEY'RE GOING BACK TO WHERE\nTHEY CAME. IF THEY CAME FROM A CERTAIN\nCOUNTRY THEY'LL BE BROUGHT BACK TO THEIR COUNTRY.\nTHAT'S THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.\n>> DOES HE STILL SUPPORT THAT? REMOVING THE 11 MILLION OR SO\nUNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS? >> WHAT HE SUPPORTS -- IF YOU GO\nBACK TO HIS CONVENTION SPEECH A MONTH AGO, DANA, HE SUPPORTS\nMAKING SURE THAT WE ENFORCE THE LAW, THAT WE ARE RESPECTFUL OF\nTHOSE AMERICANS WHO ARE LOOKING FOR WELL-PAYING JOBS AND THAT WE\nARE FAIR AND HUMANE FOR THOSE WHO LIVE AMONG US IN THIS\nCOUNTRY. AS THE WEEKS UNFOLD, AS THE\nWEEKS UNFOLD, HE WILL LAY OUT THE SPECIFICS OF THAT PLAN THAT\nHE WOULD IMPLEMENT AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\n>> WILL THAT PLAN INCLUDE A DEPORTATION FORCE, THE KIND THAT\nHE JUST -- YOU JUST HEARD IN THE SOUND BITE AND THAT HE TALKED\nABOUT DURING THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES?\n>> TO BE DETERMINED. >> OKAY.\nLET'S TALK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS.\nBACK IN APRIL YOU SAID ON CNN THAT YOU WANT TRUMP TO BE\nTRANSPARENT. LET'S LISTEN.\n>> I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE ALLIANCE BETWEEN YOU FIRST,\nKELLYANNE, BETWEEN JOHN KASICH AND TED CRUZ, THIS ALLIANCE,\nSHALL WE SAY, THAT DONALD TRUMP IS CALLING COLLUSION.\nIS THIS FAIR GAME? >> OF COURSE IT'S FAIR GAMES.\n>> ARE THEY PLAYING BY THE RULES?\n>> IT'S COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT. DONALD TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS\nAREN'T. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THOSE BE\nTRANSPARENT. >> NOW YOU'RE IN CHARGE OF HIS\nCAMPAIGN. GIVEN THAT, GIVEN HOW YOU FEEL,\nWILL WE SEE HIS TAX RETURNS SOON?\n>> NOW THAT I AM ON THE INSIDE I KNOW SOMETHING I DIDN'T KNOW\nTHEN WHICH IS HE IS UNDER AUDIT. HE HAS SAID CLEARLY AND I BACK\nHIM UP COMPLETELY, THAT WHEN THE AUDIT IS COMPLETED HE'LL RELEASE\nTHE TAX RETURNS. LET ME SAY SOMETHING ABOUT\nTRANSPARENCY. IT COMES IN MANY DIFFERENT\nFORMS. WE CAN'T IMAGINE GOING UP\nAGAINST A LESS TRANSPARENT, LESS ACCOUNTABLE, MORE SORT OF RIGGED\nAND CORRUPT INDIVIDUAL AS OUR POLITICAL OPPONENT THAN HILLARY\nCLINTON. SHE HAS HAD A TERRIBLE WEEK WHEN\nIT COMES TO BEING TRANSPARENT AND ACCOUNTABLE.\nWHETHER IT'S THE REVELATIONS OF THE PAY FOR PLAY AT THE -- IN\nTHE STATE DEPARTMENT THAT I KNOW THAT YOU -- CNN IS VERY MUCH ON\nTOP OF AND YOUR REPORTING IS, DANA.\nAS WELL AGS WHAT HAPPENED AT TH CLINTON FOUNDATION.\n>> AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THAT FOR SURE.\nBUT IN THIS PARTICULAR INTERVIEW AND THESE QUESTIONS ARE ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP. AND YOU MENTIONED THE AUDIT.\nACCORDING TO HIS LAWYERS, THE YEARS 2002 TO 2008 ARE NO LONGER\nUNDER AUDIT. SO WOULD YOU RELEASE THOSE TAX\nRETURNS? >> NO, I WOULD NOT.\nAND THIS ENTIRE TAX RETURN DEBATE IS SOMEWHAT CONFOUNDING\nTO ME IN THE FOLLOWING SENSE. I DON'T THINK THAT IT CREATES\nONE JOB, GETS ONE MORE INDIVIDUAL WHO DOES NOT HAVE\nHEALTH INSURANCE COVERED BY HEALTH INSURANCE, PARTICULARLY\nUNDER THE DISASTER THAT HAS BEEN OBAMA CARE WITH THE PRIVATE\nINSURERS PULLING OUT AND REPORTING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF\nLOSSES. I THINK WHAT PEOPLE ARE\nCONCERNED ABOUT IS HOW WOULD A PRESIDENT TRUMP OR HOW WOULD A\nPRESIDENT HILLARY AFFECT THEIR TAX BILL.\nEVERYDAY LIFE IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY UNAFFORDABLE FOR\nAMERICANS AND THEY DESERVE THE RELIEF HE LAID OUT IN HIS\nSPEECH. IF WE WANT TRANSPARENCY AND\nSPECIFICS, THE MOST RELEVANT THING PEOPLE CAN LOOK AT IS WHAT\nIS HIS PLAN FOR THEIR TAX BILL TO MAKE AFFORDABILITY, JOB\nSECURITY AND REBUILDING THE AMERICAN ECONOMY, WHETHER IT'S\nENERGY BASED, BRINGING BACK MANUFACTURING GOVERNOR PENCE HAS\nACCOMPLISHED ON HIS WATCH.

DONALD TRUMP HAS MORE GROUND TO\nMAKE UP IN THE BATTLEGROUND STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY, LESS\nMONEY TO DO IT. HOW DOES HE DO IT?\n>> HE'S WORKING WITH THE RNC. AND WE'RE GOING TO BE PROVIDING\nTHE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT HE NEEDS.\nTHERE'S INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S BEEN VERY VALUABLE THAT THE RNC\nHAS PUT IN PLACE SINCE IMP2013.

WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHERE\nMINORITIES ARE OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS, THERE'S NO QUESTION\nABOUT IT THAT THE OBAMA POLICIES HAVE BEEN FAILED POLICIES\nDESPITE ALL OF THE PROMISES.

THE WAY THAT WE'RE HEARING FROM\nTHE RNC THAT THEY ARE CHARACTERIZING HILLARY CLINTON'S\nFUND-RAISING, IS THAT SHE IS GOING FOR THE ELITES AND NOT THE\nMAN ON THE STREET.

WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT PEOPLE WHO\nARE INVOLVED IN A COMPANY, WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE\nFINANCIALLY VESTED IN A COMPANY, ONE THING YOU LOOK AT ARE SUPER\nPACS. YOU COMBINE ALL OF THE TRUMP\nSUPER PACS, YOU'RE AT ABOUT $4 MILLION IN CASH ON HAND.\nWHEN YOU HAVE THESE RESOURCES, YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO BLUDGEON\nYOUR OPPONENT. >> WERE YOU THERE YESTERDAY,\nWERE YOU A PART OF THAT MEETING? >> I WAS.\nIT WAS A TERRIFIC MEETING. IT WAS AN OPEN CONVERSATION.\nHE WANTED TO HEAR FROM THESE LEADERS ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT\nARE OF GREAT CONCERN TO THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY.\nTHEY WERE BUSINESS, CIVIC AND FAITH-BASED LEADERS WHO WERE\nTHERE. THAT WAS GREAT DISCUSSION ABOUT\nJOBS, ECONOMY, TRADE, WHAT TO DO WITH VETERANS AND VETERAN CARE,\nAMONGST OTHER ISSUES. AND OF COURSE THERE WAS A\nDISCUSSION ABOUT IMMIGRATION. >> IS IT A LITTLE LATE TO KNOW\nINTRODUCE THIS MEETING? >> NO.\nTO THE CONTRARY. MANY OF THOSE LEADERS HAD\nALREADY MET WITH MR. TRUMP PREVIOUSLY.\nIT WAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME TOGETHER COLLECTIVELY AS A\nGROUP. FOR MOST VOTERS, THEY'RE BARELY\nBEGINNING TO FOCUS ON THIS CAMPAIGN AS THEY DO FOR MOST\nNATIONAL ELECTIONS. KID ARE BEGINNING TO GET BACK TO\nSCHOOL. LABOR DAY IS COMING.\n80 DAYS OUT IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT YOU REALLY NEED TO DO TO\nFINE TUNE YOUR CAMPAIGN AND ORGANIZE AND MOVE IT AND PUSH\nFORWARD. YESTERDAY WE HAD A GREAT\nCONVERSATION WITH HISPANIC LEADERS ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES OF\nGREAT CONCERN. IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO BE\nABLE TO EXCHANGE IDEAS AND STRATEGIES.\n>> THE FOURTH CONSECUTIVE DAY ON SATURDAY WE SAW DONALD TRUMP\nMAKING AN APPEAL TO AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS.\nLET'S LOOK AT THIS FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE.\nI WANT TO GET YOUR THOUGHT ON THIS.\nCOULD THIS, THE NUMBERS WE'RE SEEING THAT DONALD TRUMP IS\nFIGHTING AGAINST, BE MAYBE THE STRUGGLE THAT ANY REPUBLICAN\nCOMING AFTER BARACK OBAMA WOULD HAVE.\nTHE PRESIDENT HAS OVERALL A 52% APPROVAL RATING, 75 NON-WHITE,\n85% IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY. AND ANY REPUBLICAN IN THIS\nPOSITION WHO IS THREATENING THAT LEGACY OF BARACK OBAMA CHRKS\nBL WHICH BLACK VOTERS HAVE SUCH A\nCLOSE AFFILIATION WITH, WOULD BE FACING WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS\nFACING. >> REGARDLESS OF WHAT MY\nCOLLEAGUE THIS MORNING SAID, WHEN YOU HAVE AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nUNEMPLOYMENT RATE WHICH HAS ACTUALLY GONE DOWN AND YOU HAVE\nUNINSURED THAT HAS GONE DOWN AND WHEN YOU HAVE PROGRAMS LIKE MY\nBROTHER'S KEEPER OR JUST THE EXAMPLE HE SETS FOR\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN PEOPLE IN THIS COU\nCOUNTRY. THAT BEING SAID, THOUGH, I DO\nBELIEVE A REPUBLICAN COULD GET THE NUMBERS MITT ROMNEY HAD,\nMAYBE GET TO THE NUMBERS THAT GEORGE W. BUSH HAD.\nBUT DONALD TRUMP IS NONE OF THOSE.\nYOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THE CENTRAL PARK FIVE.\nYOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS SUED BY THE DEPARTMENT\nOF JUSTICE.

HE MAY BE MAKING THESE OVERTURES\nRIGHT NOW BUT WE KNOW IT'S 80 DAYS OUT.\nWHERE HAS HE BEEN THE LAST 432 DAYS SINCE HE'S BEEN IN THE\nRACE? HISPANIC VOTERS ARE NOT GOING TO\nFORGET HE PATRONIZED HIM WITH THE TACO BOWL.\n>> I WANT TO GIVE YOU TEN SECONDS.\nTHAT'S ALL I HAVE FOR YOU. >> WHAT DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T DO\nIS PANDER TO OUR COMMUNITIES.

AT LEAST 50 PEOPLE WERE KILLED,\nMORE THAN 90 WERE INJURED. ACCORDING TO TURKISH OFFICIALS,\nTHE WEDDING WAS WRAPPING UP. WHERE THIS BOMB ATTACK TOOK\nPLACE IS ONLY ABOUT 40 OR SO MILES FROM THE TURKISH/SYRIAN\nBORDER. IT'S BEEN KNOWN AS A HOTBED OF\nISLAMIC EXTREMISM. IT'S A PLACE WHERE ISIS FIGHTERS\nUSED TO REGULARLY GO IN AND OUT OF SYRIA.\nIT'S A PLACE WHERE UP UNTIL ABOUT A YEAR AGO TURKISH\nOFFICIALS TURNED A BLIND EYE TO ISIS FIGHTERS GOING IN AND OUT\nOF THERE. FOR THE LAST SIX OR NINE MONTHS\nOR SO, IT'S BEEN AN AREA THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\nOFFICIALS HAVE BEEN WARNING IS A VERY, VERY DANGEROUS PLACE FOR\nWESTERNERS, NGO WORKERS, AND EVEN THE LOCAL POPULATION THERE\nSUFFERING FROM ISIS ATTACK THERE IS.\nTHIS ALL COMES AS TURKEY IN THE LAST YEAR HAS SEEN A RASH OF\nISIS BOMBINGS NOT ONLY IN MARKETS AND TOURIST ATTRACTIONS\nIN ANKARA AND IN ISTANBUL BUT LAST MONTH THE MILITARY THERE\nLAUNCHED A COUP AGAINST PRESIDENT ERDOGAN AND THIS WEEK\nWE SAW TURKISH SEPARAISTS LAUNCH TWO ATTACKS ON MILITARY\nAND POLICE IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY.\nTHIS IS SORT OF THE CHAOS THAT THE TURKISH INVOLVEMENT IN SYRIA\nHAS BROUGHT ABOUT IN TURKEY IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS OR SO.\nINCREASINGLY THE NATO ALLY, AND IT IS A KEY NATO ALLY, IS SEEING\nCONFLICT AND CHAOS GROWING THERE AND THERE ARE REAL CONCERNS IN\nNOT ONLY D.C.

PEOPLE MOTIVATED BY HOPE OF\nFINANCIAL GAIN OR CONCERNS ABOUT GLOBAL WARNING OR WHATEVER THE\nOBAMA PEOPLE TELL US DO NOT DO THINGS LIKE THIS.\nTHIS IS A RELIGION MOVEMENT. IT MAY BE A DISTORTED ONE BUT\nIT'S A RELIGIOUS MOVEMENT. >> STARTING AT 4 YEARS OLD.\n>> THERE'S BEEN SOME FALLOUT IN THE NEWS FROM THE MEETING HELD\nBETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND A GROUP OF HISPANIC SUPPORTERS OF HIS\nYESTERDAY. IN THE HOURS AFTER THAT, A BUNCH\nOF NEWS ORGANIZATIONS BEGINNING WITH BUZZ FEED, WHICH IS AN\nONLINE FASHION BLOG WITH A NEWS COMPONENT, RAN HEADLINES ON\nSTORIES LIKE THIS. IN REVERSAL, IT SAYS, TRUMP\nINDICATES TO HISPANIC LEADERS OPENNESS TO LEGALIZATION FOR\nIMMIGRANTS. NBC NEWS SAYS GOP HISPANICS\nTRUMP OPEN TO EASING HIS POLL LICKS ON UNDOCUMENTED.\nDAILY NEWS TALKS ABOUT HE WILL BE HUMANE AND EFFICIENT.\nWE TALKED TO SENATOR JEFF SESSIONS.\nWE'LL GET TO THAT IN A MOMENT BECAUSE ON THE SURFACE YOU'D\nREAD THESE HEADLINES AND THINK, WOW, THIS MUST BE A HUGE\nREVERSAL FOR DONALD TRUMP, THAT HE'S GOING TO SHIFT HIS\nIMMIGRATION POLICY, BUT HE'S TALKED ABOUT BEING HUMANE IN THE\nPAST, OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS AND INTO LAST YEAR.\nLISTEN TO WHAT HE'S HAD TO SAY. LISTEN.\n>> WE'RE GOING TO DO IT IN A VERY HUMANE FASHION.\nBELIEVE ME. I HAVE A BIGGER HEART THAN YOU\nDO. I'M GOING TO DO IT IN A VERY\nHUMANE FASHION. WE'RE ROUNDING THEM UP IN A\nHUMANE WAY AND A NICE WAY AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE HAPPY\nBECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE LEGALIZED.\nWE'RE GOING TO HAVE A DEPORTATION FORCE AND YOU'RE\nGOING TO DO IT HUMANELY. >> HE TALKED ABOUT THE\nDEPORTATION OF 11 MILLIONMIGRAN COUNTRY AND HE'S GOING TO BUILD\nA WALL BUT THERE WILL BE A BIG BEAUTIFUL DOOR AND SOME WILL BE\nALLOWED BACK IN. >> THIS WAS A BIG STICKING POINT\nIN THE PRIMARIES. HIS REPUBLICAN RIVALS SAYS\nYOU'RE CRAZY, YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO ROUND UP 11 MILLION PEOPLE.\nHE'S SAYING WE'RE GOING TO DO IT HUMANELY AND HAVE A PLAN TO GET\nIT DONE. >> TALK ABOUT A RED HERRING.\nHERE IS THE POINT. AMERICA NEEDS AN IMMIGRATION\nSYSTEM THAT SERVES AMERICAN CITIZENS, ALL AMERICAN CITIZENS.\nOUR CURRENT SYSTEM SERVES A NARROW SLICE AT THE TOP WHO\nBENEFIT FROM CHEAP HOUSEHOLD LABOR AND CHEAP WORKING WAGES\nAND EVERYONE ELSE SUFFERS. THAT'S THE TRUTH.\nNOBODY SAYS IT OUT LOUD. JEFF SESSIONS SAYS IT OUT LOUD.\nWE TALKED TO SESSIONS A MINUTE AGO.\nHERE IS WHAT HE SAID ABOUT IT. >> HE HAD A GREAT MEETING WITH\nPEOPLE WHO HAD DIFFERENT IDEAS, AND I UNDERSTAND -- I WASN'T\nTHERE -- BUT HE HAD A GOOD DISCUSSION.\nHE LISTENED TO ALL THE DIFFERENT VIEWS.\nLOOK, WE NEED A LAWFUL SYSTEM OF IMMIGRATION.\nTRUMP IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR AND CORRECT ON THAT.\nWE MUST END THE LAWLESSNESS FIRST.\nWE CAN'T TALK ABOUT THESE OTHER ISSUES UNTIL THAT OCCURS.\nI THINK THAT REMAINS HIS FIRM POSITION.\n>> HE TALKED A LOT MORE ABOUT  >> AND HAVING A SYSTEM THAT\nSERVES THE COUNTRY. TRUMP TALKING ABOUT THE WALL AND\nDEPORTATION ALLOWS THE OPPONENTS NOT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE.\nIF YOU'RE LETTING IN TWICE THE NUMBER OF IMMIGRANTS AS THE\nNUMBER OF JOBS YOU'RE CREATING, WHOSE INTEREST IS THAT IN?\nWE'RE NOT EVEN DEBAING THAT. >> I THINK PEOPLE STILL WANT TO\nKNOW WHAT TRUMP'S POSITION IS. WE HAD TWO INTERVIEWS AND WE HAD\nA HARD TIME GETTING ANSWERS. >> I COULDN'T AGREE MORE AND\nTRUMP IS GOING TO EXPLAIN THAT. I THINK THE KEY IS LEGAL\nIMMIGRATION. OUR ECONOMY CANNOT SUPPORT A\nMILLION LOW-SKILLED WORKERS EVERY YEAR.\nNOTHING AGAINST THEM. I THINK THEY'RE MOSTLY GOOD\nPEOPLE BUT IS IT GOOD FOR US? >> MEANWHILE S THERE A DOUBLE\nSTANDARD IN THE MEDIA?

THIS IS IT.\n>> IS IT IN THE SENSE THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS PROVEN\nFRUSTRATING TO HILLARY CLINTON IS BECAUSE PEOPLE THINK THEY\nKNOW HER BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN AROUND FOR SO LONG.\nIT'S HARD FOR PEOPLE TO CHANGE OPINIONS ABOUT HER.\nDONALD TRUMP, PEOPLE KNOW HIM AS A CELEBRITY AND A REAL ESTATE\nGUY BUT HE DID CHANGE OPINIONS ABOUT HIM BECAUSE HE'S NEW ON\nTHE POLITICAL STAGE. IS THERE A FEAR IN THE CAMPAIGN?\nTHEY MAY THINK IT'S CYNICAL AND BOGUS, BUT DO THEY THINK IT\nMIGHT WORK? >> THEY WORRY IT MIGHT HAVE THE\nEFFECT OF CONSOLIDATING REPUBLICANS.\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT THE POLLING IN RECENT WEEKS, IT'S SHOWN THAT\nDONALD TRUMP HAS NOT DONE WHAT VIRTUALLY EVERY OTHER REPUBLICAN\nNOMINEE HAS DONE, WHICH IS CONSOLIDATE HIS BASE.\nGET UP WHERE SHE IS AMONG DEMOCRATS, IN THE 80s AND CLOSE\nTO THE 90s AMONG REPUBLICANS. THERE ARE MANY REPUBLICANS\nINCLUDING PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON WHO WANT TO SAY WE WANT TO KNOW\nIF DONALD TRUMP WILL BE RELIABLE TO DO WHAT WE WANT HIM TO DO.\nTHAT'S WHAT HE DEMONSTRATED LAST WEEK.\nI DON'T THINK THE CLINTON FOLKS ARE WORRIED ABOUT SWING VOTERS.\nTO JONATHAN'S POINT, THE SUBURBAN WOMEN, THEY'VE BEEN\nBOMBARDED WITH ADS FROM THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN LOCKING IN\nDONALD TRUMP'S PERSONA FOR MANY, MANY MONTHS NOW.\nIT WILL BE VERY HARD TO UNDO THAT WITH ONE SPEECH.\nI THINK REPUBLICANS WHO ARE LOOKING FOR A REASON TO TRUST\nTRUMP, THIS MIGHT BE THAT REASON THAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR.\n>> A LOT OF THE POLLS SHOW THAT SOME OF THE REPUBLICANS ARE\nCONCERNED ABOUT HIM BEING INTOLERANT.\nONE IN FIVE REPUBLICAN MEN SEE HIM AS INTOLERANT.\n25% OF REPUBLICAN WOMEN. SO WHEN HE GOES AND HE IS IN\nFRONT OF THE WHITE AUDIENCES, HE ACTUALLY IS APPEALING TO THOSE\nWHITE AUDIENCES WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT AFRICAN-AMERICANS.\nHE ISN'T REALLY, I DON'T THINK AT LEAST, APPEALING TO\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS. HE IS TRYING TO APPEAL TO THE\nAUDIENCES HE IS IN FRONT OF. >> YOU MENTIONED THE SOFTER\nTOUCH OF KELLYANNE CONWAY. SHE HAS NEVER RUN A CAMPAIGN.\nA LOT OF REPUBLICANS ARE NERVOUS ABOUT HER RUNNING A CAMPAIGN AT\nTHIS LEVEL. SHE HAS A HISTORY OF MESSAGING\nTO GET TO MORE MODERATE VOTERS. WE SAW DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE\nPENCE GO TO BATON ROUGE. IT'S A PHOTO OP.\nA LOT OF THEM DO. I AM NOT CRITICIZING HIM.\nHE WENT AND SHOWED SOME COMPASSION.\nHELPING UNLOAD AN AID TRUCK. ON A COUPLE OCCASIONS HE SAID HE\nTHOUGHT BARACK OBAMA SHOULD HAVE BROKEN HIS VACATION AND GONE\nTHERE OR AT LEAST COME BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE TO MONITOR THIS.\nIS THIS A SMART, REACTIVE POLITICS, NEITHER HERE NOR\nTHERE? >> I THINK IT'S A RARE MOMENT\nWHERE HE SAW A MOMENT THAT MADE HIM LOOK A BIT MORE\nCOMPASSIONATE AND WENT FOR THAT LANE.\nTHERE IS A LANE OPEN BECAUSE OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION UP\nUNTIL SEVERAL DAYS AGO NOT HAVING RELEASED A STATEMENT,\nTHOUGH THEY'VE DONE RESOURCE UPDATES.\nI THINK IT WAS NOT A BAD MOVE. THE QUESTION IS CAN HE FIND THE\nLANES FOR THE REST OF THE CAMPAIGN.\nYOU'RE RIGHT WHEN HE IS PROBABLY TRYING TO GO AFTER DISAFFECTED\nREPUBLICANS. HAD HE DONE IT SIX MONTHS AGO,\nIT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE LIKELY.\nAT THIS POINT IT'S TOUGHER. >> GREAT POINT.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WATCHED THE STATUS QUO SPEECH WERE LIKE, WHY\nDIDN'T YOU DO THIS BEFORE? T\nTHE CAMPAIGN SHAKEUP. I DON'T THINK VOTERS TEND TO\nVOTE FOR WHO IS ON THE LETTERHEAD.\nBUT THIS WAS INTERESTING. PAUL MANAFORT GETS SHOVED ASIDE\nAND THEN RESIGNS. KELLYANNE CONWAY GETS PROMOTED.\nSHE WAS THE SENIOR ADVISER AND IS NOW THE CAMPAIGN MANAGER.\nSTEVE BANNON FROM BRIGHT BART. AND ROGER AILES IS SHOWING UP AT\nCERTAIN MEETINGS. HE HELPED GEORGE H.W. BUSH MEET\nMICHAEL DUKAKIS. HE IS A GUY WHO JUST HAD TO QUIT\nHIS JOB BECAUSE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS.\nI CAN'T ASSUME THE HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN WON'T USE THAT\nIN AN ADD PRETTY SOON. INSIDE THE SHAKEUP IT'S MADE\nESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS NERVOUS.\nSTEVE BANNON HAS TREATED THEM AS A PINATA.\nIF YOU ARE A REPUBLICAN LEADER THE MAN HAS ESSENTIALLY CALLED\nYOU WORSE THAN THE DEMOCRATS. >> IT'S A JEKYLL AND HYDE\nSHAKEUP. THERE ARE TWO OPPOSITE SIDES\nHERE. THE CONCERN WITH BANNON IS THAT\nHE IS ONLY SKILLED -- AND A LITTLE BIT AILES -- THEY'RE ONLY\nSKILLED IN REACHING THE PEOPLE YOU'RE ALREADY REACHING.\nIS THAT THE GOAL? FOR A COUPLE DAYS IT LOOKED LIKE\nHE WAS TRYING TO REACH OTHER PEOPLE.\nI THINK HE'LL ALWAYS GO BACK TO THE BANNON AND AILES SIDE.\n>> MANAFORT CAME IN. HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE ADULT.\n>> HE DOESN'T WANT THAT. >> LOW ENERGY.\nHE JEB BUSHED HIM. >> TRUMP STARTED CALLING\nMANAFORT LOW ENERGY. TRUMP DOESN'T WANT ORDER.\nHE DOESN'T WANT DISCIPLINE. HE DOESN'T WANT A CHAIN OF\nCOMMAND. HE WANTS TO DO HIS THING, WHICH\nIS MAKING DECISIONS ON THE FLY BASED UPON COVERAGE, WATCHING\nSHOWS LIKE THIS, READING THE PAPERS.\nTHAT'S HOW HE OPERATES. WITH COUNSEL FROM HIS KIDS.\nLOOK, IS HE GOING TO HAVE FOLKS AROUND HIM?\nYES. BUT HE'LL NEVER OPERATE LIKE A\nTRADITIONAL CANDIDATE. MANAFORT'S EFFORTS TO IMPOSE A\nTRADITIONAL CAMPAIGN STRUCTURE ON TRUMP WERE FOUND TO FAIL.\nIN SOME WAYS IT'S AMAZING THAT IT LASTED THIS LONG.\nHE WAS TRYING TO MAKE TRUMP INTO A TRADITIONAL CANDIDATE.\nIT WAS NOT A MARRIAGE MADE IN",

TRUMP IS CHANGING\nHIS TOP STAFF FOR THE SECOND TIME IN AS MANY MONTHS.\nTHAT TELLS US A LOT ABOUT HIS MANAGEMENT STYLE AND ABOUT THE\nTURMOIL IN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\nTHERE ARE BIGGER CHANGES AS TRUMP TRIES TO TURN THE TIDE ON\nA CAMPAIGN HE IS LOSING, AND AT THE MOMENT LOSING BADLY.\nHERE IS THE QUESTION. IS THIS THE REAL DONALD TRUMP?\n>> SOMETIMES, IN THE HEAT OF DEBATE AND SPEAKING ON A\nMULTITUDE OF ISSUES, YOU DON'T CHOOSE THE RIGHT WORDS OR YOU\nSAY THE WRONG THING. I HAVE DONE THAT.\nAND BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I REGRET IT.\nAND I DO REGRET IT. PARTICULARLY WHERE IT MAY HAVE\nCAUSED PERSONAL PAIN. >> OR IS THIS THE REAL DONALD\nTRUMP? >> WHEN MEXICO SENDS ITS PEOPLE,\nTHEY'RE NOT SENDING THEIR BEST.

I DON'T REMEMBER.\nI LOVE THE OLD DAYS. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY USED TO DO TO\nGUYS LIKE THAT IN A PLACE LIKE THIS?\nTHEY WOULD BE CARRIED OUT ON A STRETCHER FOLKS.\nHE IS WALKING OUT LIKE BIG HIGH FIVES, SMILING, LAUGHING, LIKE\nTO PUNCH HIM IN THE FACE. I'LL TELL YOU.\n>> TRY IT AGAIN. IS THIS THE REAL DONALD TRUMP?\n>> A NEW FUTURE REQUIRES BRAND-NEW LEADERSHIP.\nLOOK HOW MUCH AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES HAVE SUFFERED UNDER\nDEMOCRATIC CONTROL. TO THOSE I SAY THE FOLLOWING.\nWHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE BY TRYING SOMETHING NEW.\n>> THAT GUY OR THIS GUY, THE CANDIDATE WHO TALKED ABOUT\nPAYING THE LEGAL FEES OF A WHITE SUPPORTER WHO SUCKER-PUNCHED AN\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN DEMONSTRATOR AT A TRUMP RALLY, THE MAN WHO, WHEN\nCONSIDERING RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN 2012 SERVED AS\nCHIEF CHEERLEADER FOR THE BIRTHER MOVEMENT.\n>> I HAVE DONE A GREAT SERVICE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\nI GOT HIM TO RELEASE A BIRTH CERTIFICATE THAT HE SHOULD HAVE\nDONE THREE YEARS AGO AND FOUR YEARS AGO.\n>> WITH US TO SHARE THE REPORTING AND THEIR INSIGHTS\nCNN'S NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, JONATHAN MARTIN OF THE \"NEW YORK\nTIMES,\" ABBY PHILLIP OF THE \"WASHINGTON POST\" AND ABBEY CAM\nOF THE FEDERALIST. >> IF DONALD TRUMP, THE MAN WHO\nSAYS KI DON'T REGRET ANYTHING SAYS HE NOW REGRETS A LOT.\nHE IS SUDDENLY MAKING AN OUTREACH IN EVERY SPEECH TO\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS AND YESTERDAY, MARY CATHERINE HE HAD A SPEECH\nWITH AFRICAN-AMERICANS SUPPORTERS.\nTHE REPORTS BY UNIVISION AND OTHERS THAT AS EARLY AS THURSDAY\nIN COLORADO, A STATE WHERE THE LATINO VOTE IS HUGE.\nDONALD TRUMP, WHOSE WEBSITE NOW SAYS AMNESTY MIGHT SOFTEN HIS\nPOSITION ON THE 11 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS.\nTHIS IS NOT A PIVOT. IT'S LIKE A BODY DOUBLE.\n>> I THINK DONALD TRUMP HAS ALWAYS BEEN CHANGEABLE ON\nPOLICIES. BUT NOT CHANGEABLE ON TONE.\nTHIS WAS AN INTERESTING WEEK BECAUSE YOU DID SEE HIM CHANGE\nTONE. WHAT I THOUGHT WAS INTERESTING\nABOUT THE SHAKEUP IS YOU ABOUT BANNON WHO IS A PUNCH YOU IN\nYOUR FACE RETTERITION AND KELLYANNE CONWAY WHO HAS A\nLIGHTER, EFFECTIVE TOUCH. YOU SAW HER CAPABLE FINGERPRINTS\nON THE SPEECH AND THEN YOU SAW HIM VEER FROM IT IN THE\nSUBSEQUENT SPEECHES. HE WANTS TO GO BACK TO RIFFING\nBECAUSE THAT'S WHO HE IS. IT'S LIKE BRINGING IN A\nQUARTERBACK CONTROVERSY DURING THE PLAYOFFS.\n>> AS WE TALK THROUGHOUT THE SHOW AND LATER ABOUT THE\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN OUTREACH, BUT MY FIRST QUESTION IS, IS IT\nBELIEVABLE? CAN YOU CHANGE?\nCAN YOU SO SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE YOUR TONE 11 WEEKS OUT AND WILL\nPEOPLE FIND IT CONVINCING? I HAVE LEARNED LESSONS?\nI'M A BETTER CANDIDATE. I'VE GROWN.\nPEOPLE DO GROW. NONE OF US ARE PERFECT.\nWILL THEY SAY, COME ON, BS, THIS IS A CYNICAL PLOY BECAUSE WHAT\nYOU WERE DOING WASN'T WORKING. >> HE HAS CALLED HIMSELF THE\nCANDIDATE OF CHANGE. IT FEELS LIKE A U-TURN.\nCAN HE STICK TO IT. I THINK THAT'S THE BIG QUESTION.\nI THINK THE -- PART OF THE PROBLEM IS A LOT OF THE POLLS\nOBVIOUSLY SAY HE IS DOING VERY POORLY.\nA LOT OF THIS STUFF IS BAKED IN. YOU TALK ABOUT KELLYANNE CONWAY,\nFOR INSTANCE, IT SEEMS LIKE SHE IS TRYING TO ADD COMPASSION AND\nMAKE HIM OUT TO BE THE COMPASSIONATE CONSERVATIVE.\nHE HAD BEEN THE LAW AND ORDER CANDIDATE, SHADES OF NIXON.\nHE'S TRYING TO PICK UP ON THE GEORGE W. BUSH APPROACH.\nTHOSE TWO WERE KIND OF IN CONFLICT.\nCAN HE KIND OF MAINTAIN BOTH OF THOSE IDENTITIES AT THE SAME\nTIME, KEEP A HOLD OF THE BASE THAT LOVES HIM WHEN HE'S\nRIFFING, LOVES HIM WHEN HE'S PLAYING THE TOUGH GUY BUT ALSO\nTRY TO GET SOME COLLEGE EDUCATED WHITE WOMEN AND SWING VOTERS WHO\nWANT TO SEE THE COMPASSION. >> DIDN'T THE BASE LOVE HIM WHEN\nHE SAID BUILD A BALL AND HE ADMIRED OPERATION WET BACK.\nIF HE STANDS UP IN COLORADO AND SAYS LET'S FIND A HUMANE WAY TO\nKEEP THE UNDOCUMENTED HERE. THEY'LL SAY GREAT, THAT'S THE\nONLY VIABLE POLICY BUT HIS BASE WILL SAY, WHOA?\n>> IF YOU LOOK AT THE SCRIPT THIS WEEK AND THE FIRST AD HE\nRELEASED IT'S THE SAME POPULISM VERGEN ON NATIONALISM HE'S BEEN\nPITCHING FOR THE LAST FEW MONTHS.\nIT DOESN'T HAVE MUCH APPEAL FOR CERTAINLY NON-WIHITE VOTERS AND\nUPSCALE VOTERS WHO ARE OFTEN THE SWING VOTERS.\nSHOWING AN",

AND THIS IS A FACTION.\nTRUMPISM, IF YOU WILL, THAT WAS ABLE TOO GROW IN LARGE PART\nBECAUSE YOU HAD A FIELD OF 17 CANDIDATES STARTING OUT.\nAND SO NOW WHAT YOU SEE IS ONE INDIVIDUAL WHO IS SORT OF THE\nGOP LABORATORY, BUT HE HAS GOTTEN OUTSIDE OF IT NOW AND HAS\nTAKEN OVER THINGS. IT'S NOT THE PARTY THAT PEOPLE\nTHOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO BE SUPPORTING GOING INTO THIS YEAR.\nSO SOME TALKERS CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN ON THE TRUMP TRAIN VERY\nEARLY AND HAVE PUSHED US ALL ALONG.\nOTHERS HAVE SAID THIS WAS A DISASTER FOR THE GOP, AND THEY\nCONTINUE TO SAY THAT TO THIS DAY, DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE\nHAVE HAD THE CONVENTION AND TRUMP IS CLEARLY THE NOMINEE.\nSO IT DEPENDS ON WHO YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT IT AND WHICH\nFACTION YOU'RE LOOKING AT. >> BUT BRIAN, IF I PICK UP ON\nWHAT BUC SAID, USING THE WORD \"LABORATORY,\" THE GUYS WITH THE\nBUNSEN BURNERS AND BEAKERS HAVE BEEN POURING THE CONCOCTIONS FOR\n30 YEARS. AND WHAT THEY HAVE GROWN IS\nDONALD TRUMP IN THEIR OWN IMAGE. AM I WRONG?\n>> ABSOLUTELY NO, YOU'RE RIGHT, MICHAEL.\nI WAS LISTENING TO BUC AND IT SORT OF REMINDS ME OF A GUY WHO\nHAS BEEN EATING POORLY, NOT EXERCISING FOR 30 YEARS, AND\nTHEN TURNS AROUND AND STARTS EXERCISING ONE DAY, AND SIX\nMONTHS LATER IS SURPRISED HE HAS A HEART ATTACK.\nYOU KNOW, THEY HAVE BEEN CULTIVATING THIS FOR YEARS AND\nYEARS AND YEARS. HE -- I MEAN, DONALD TRUMP IS\nREADING OUT OF THE TALK RADIO HYMNAL.\nHE IS VALIDATING THE VIEWS OF A LOT OF CONSERVATIVES OUT THERE\nWHO WANTED A COMMUNITY, AND TALK RADIO HAS PROVIDED THAT\nCOMMUNITY FOR THEM AND CABLE \"NEWS NOW\" AND WEBSITES LIKE\nBREITBART. AND THE FACT IS, THAT THIS IS --\nHE IS A CREATURE OF THAT. I MEAN, THIS IS THE -- YOU HEAR\nHIS FANS SAYING THE SAME THINGS ABOUT HIM THEY SAID ABOUT RUSH\nLIMBAUGH IN THE EARLY 1990s, THANK GOD I HAVE SOMEONE WHO IS\nGIVING ME A VOICE. >> AND AMY, THE ARGUMENT THAT\nI'M MAKING, THE POLITICAL ARGUMENT, THAT'S GREAT FOR THE\nBASE. THAT WILL PUT 20,000 PEOPLE INTO\nARENA, ALL FIRED UP. BUT IT DOESN'T WIN GENERAL\nELECTIONS, BECAUSE THERE'S JUST NOT THE CROSS APPEAL THAT'S\nNECESSARY. HOW AM I WRONG?\n>> I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU THAT NO, YOU CAN'T WIN THE PRESIDENCY\nWITH YOUR BASE. AND THAT -- APPLIES TO THE LEFT,\nAS WELL. THAT APPLIES TO HILLARY CLINTON.\nBUT I DISAGREE WITH YOUR PREMISE THAT THIS IS COMING OUT OF RIGHT\nWING RADIO. MY FORMER BOSS, GLENN BECK, HAS\nBEEN ON RADIO LAMBASTING DONALD TRUMP FOR THE LAST YEAR.\nTHIS IS RIDICULOUS. IF YOU WANT TO POINT A FINGER AT\nWHO GAVE US DONALD TRUMP, YOU CAN POINT IT TO 1600\nPENNSYLVANIA AVENUE AND THAT IS BARACK OBAMA.\nTHAT CAME FROM THE MIDTERM ELECTION IN 2010 THAT GAVE YOU\nTHE TEA PARTY, THE MIDTERM ELECTION IN 2014 WHERE YOU HAD\nVOTERS THAT SAID TO MITCH McDO\nMcCONNELL AND PAUL REASON, WE WANT TO PUT THE BRAKES ON LEDGE\nSTATING BY EXECUTIVE ACTION, BY PRESIDENT OBAMA TAKING THIS\nAGENDA TO THE LEFT. AND DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTERS, IF\nYOU HAVE LOOKED AT POLLING DATA OVER THE LAST YEAR, THEY\nACTUALLY SORT OF SPAN THE IDEOLOGICAL SPECTRUM.\nTHEY'RE NOT JUST FROM THE RIGHT. THEY'RE ALSO FROM THE CENTER,\nTHEY'RE DISAFFECTED VOTERS WHO WANT A VOICE IN POLITICS.\nAND THEY FEEL THAT BELTWAY POLITICIANS HAVE NOT BEEN\nLISTENING TO THEM FOR A VERY LONG TIME.\n>> BUT BUC, HERE'S WHAT I'M SAYING IN DRAWING A LINEAR\nCONNECTION BETWEEN SOME OF WHAT YOU HEAR ON THE RADIO OR IN\nCONSERVATIVE OUTLETS AND TRUMP. I'LL GIVE YOU A TOP OF MIND\nEXAMPLE. RUSH LIMBAUGH REFERRED AS YOU\nWELL REMEMBER TO SANDRA FLUKE AS A SLUT.\nIS IT ANY SURPRISE THEN YOU HEAR IN THE COURSE OF THIS CAMPAIGN\nDONALD TRUMP TALK ABOUT MEGYN KELLY HAVING BLOOD COMING OUT OF\nHER \"WHEREVER.\" OR ANOTHER EXPERIENCE THAT I\nREMEMBER WAS GLENN BECK MAKING REFERENCE TO BARACK OBAMA AS A\nQUOTE, UNQUOTE, RACIST WITH A DEEP-SEATED HATRED OF WHITE\nPEOPLE. IS IT ANY DOUBT THEN THAT YOU'RE\nGOING TO HEAR CANDIDATE TRUMP SAY OUT ON THE HUFTINGS -- THE\nRISK AND THE PERIL THAT THE OBAMA PRESIDENCY HAS PRESENTED\nTO AMERICA? I SEE IT ALL AS CONNECTED.\nTHEY HAVE CULTIVATED A RESEPTEMBER I HAVENESS TO THIS\nTYPE OF TONALITY AND SPEECH. YOU CAN REPLY BECAUSE I KNOW YOU\nDISAGREE. >> OF COURSE.\nTHOSE ARE DISCONNECTED. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT IS YOU\nGO AND PULL COMMENTS FROM DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS OVER A\nPERIOD OF MANY YEARS AND SAY, WELL, THIS COMMENT WAS BAD OR I\nDIDN'T LIKE THIS, THIS COMMENT WAS BAD, THIS COMMENT WAS BAD,\nTHEREFORE, THAT'S WHAT THE GOP HAS BECOME.\nI MEAN, THERE ARE PLENTY OF TIMES WHEN YOU COULD LOOK AT\nWHAT'S SAID ON THE LEFT BY ALL SORTS OF FIGURES, INCLUDING\nPEOPLE IN THE MEDIA, THAT I THINK PEOPLE WOULD FIND VERY\nDISTASTEFUL. I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT -- SURE\nYOU'RE SAYING WHAT. THERE IS A COARSENESS THAT\nEXISTS IN CONSERVATIVE MEDIA THAT DEFINITE EXIST IN LIBERAL\nMEDIA. >> NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M\nSAYING. I'M SAYING IT MAY EXIST IN\nLIBERAL MEDIA, AS WELL BUT HASN'T TAKEN CONTROL OF THE\nPARTY. THE REASON I'M BRINGING IT UP AT\nTHE OUTSET, ONE OF THESE PRO VAC TOURS IS NOW FORMAL RERUNNING\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. SO IT'S COME FULL CIRCLE.\n>> HOLD ON, MICHAEL. HOLD ON.\nI WANT TO JUMP IN HERE. >> ONE AT A TIME.\nONE AT A TIME. ONE AT A TIME.\n>> I JUST WANT TO SAY -- >> YOU GO FIRST.\n>> THIS IDEA THAT DONALD TRUMP IS SOMEHOW THE CULMINATION AS WE\nSAID BEFORE OF DECADES OF RIGHT WING RADIO IS NONSENSE.\nAS AMY WELL POINTED OUT, YOU HAVE SOME OF THE MOST PROMINENT\nCONSERVATIVE TALK SHOW RADIO HOSTS IN THE COUNTRY WHO ARE\nADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO TRUMP, TO THIS DAY, EVEN THOUGH HE IS THE\nREPUBLICAN NOMINEE. WE'RE NOT EVEN IN THE PRIMARY\nANY MORE. AS I SAID --\n>> BUT BUC, YOU CAN'T JUST UNDO --\n>> YOU HAVE PEOPLE IN THE NEVER TRUMP MOVEMENT.\n>>. >> BUC, BUC --\n>> MICHAEL, CAN I -- >> THEY BUILT -- WAIT A MINUTE.\nYOU CAN, I PROMISE YOU CAN. BUT LET ME SAY THIS.\nTHEY BUILT THE LAB. THEY JUST DON'T LIKE WHAT IT\nCREATED. AMY, RESPOND TO THAT.\n>> I THINK YOU DON'T LIKE WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SAYING\nTHROUGH DONALD TRUMP. AND WHERE I WANTED TO JUMP IN,\nIS YOU'RE ALSO NOT ACKNOWLEDGING HIS NEW CAMPAIGN MANAGER, KELLY\nANN CONWAY. A WOMAN THAT I HAVE KNOWN FOR\nTWO DECADES, FROM WASHINGTON, D.C., WHO IS A REASONABLE,\nLOVELY PERSON. WHO IS, I THINK, HELPING SHAPE\nDONALD TRUMP SORT OF NEW ACCESSIBILITY TO VOTERS.\nSO YOU'RE POINTING TO STEVE BANNON FROM BREITBART, RIGHTLY,\nBUT NOT THE FACT THAT DONALD TRUMP JUST ELEVATED A WOMAN, A\nCONSERVATIVE WOMAN, VERY WELL-KNOWN IN CONSERVATIVE\nCIRCLES, ALSO ON TELEVISION, ALSO IN RIGHT WING MEDIA, IS\nACTUALLY BEING A VERY LOVELY, THOUGHTFUL, CENTRIST WOMAN, AND\nI -- I THINK THAT'S NOT VERY FAIR OF YOU, MICHAEL.\n>> I APPRECIATED HAVING HER HERE LAST WEEKEND.\nAS A MATTER OF FACT, SHE WAS MY GUEST.\nDR. ROSENWALD, BAIL ME OUT. I'M UNDER ASSAULT HERE.\n>> NO, YOU'RE 100% RIGHT. YOU CAN'T PUT THE GENIE IN THE\nBOTTLE AND TURN AROUND AND SAY WE DON'T LIKE IT.\nAND TO AMY'S POINT, IT'S NOT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\nIT'S A SEGMENT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\nAND A SEGMENT THAT IS GREAT FOR MAKING MONEY ON CAPABLE NEWS OR\nTALK RADIO, BUT IT'S NOT LARGE ENOUGH TO ELECT A CANDIDATE.\nYOU CAN'T WIN WITH THE 4540% OF THE REPUBLICAN BASE THAT GOT\nDONALD TRUMP TO THIS POINT. IF HE DOES NOT COME BACK TO THE\nCENTER, AND HIRING STEVE BANNON IS INDICATION HE WANTS TO KEEP\nGOING DOWN THE PUGNACIOUS CONSERVATIVE CHAIN THAT WILL\nTHRILL HIS FANS, HOW DOES THAT GET YOU TO 50-PLUS 1%?\n>> IRONICALLY, WHAT I FIND AMAZING IS THAT PAUL MANAFORT,\nHIS PREVIOUS CAMPAIGN MANAGER, WHO HAS NOW RESIGNED, KEPT\nPROMISING US AS PRESIDENTIAL PIVOT THAT NEVER HAPPENED, AND\nTHEN HE HIRED STEVE BANNON, AND IT DOES HAPPEN THAT DONALD TRUMP\nDOES GIVE THE SPEECH. HE GOES TO LOUISIANA.\nHE DOES START THIS OUTREACH. AND SO I HAVE JUST -- THIS WHOLE\nTHEORY THAT DONALD TRUMP -- >> AMY, I THINK THAT'S A\nGREAT -- >> DONALD TRUMP HAS NEVER BEEN A\nMEMBER OF THE RIGHT WING. >> HE'S 100% CORRECT.\n>> I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HOW LONG THIS NEW TRUMP LASTS.\nGUYS, OBVIOUSLY THIS A GREAT SUBJECT FOR MORE TALK ON A\nDIFFERENT DATE. THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE.\n>> THANK YOU.",

HE WASN'T GOING TO CHANGE.\nAND HE SEEMED TO MAKE THAT CLEAR BY HIRING STEPHEN BANNON, THE\nCHAIRMAN OF THE VEHEMENTLY PRO-TRUMP CONSERVATIVE WEBSITE,\nBREITBART. BUT THE MORE MEDIA IMPACT SEEMED\nTO COME FROM THE TOPIC OF A NEW CAMPAIGN MANAGER, POLLSTER\nKELLYANNE WHO IS POPULAR WITH REPORTERS AND TOUTING TRUMP'S\nSPEECH IN WHICH HE SAID HE REGRETTED CAUSING ANYONE\nPERSONAL PAIN. >> YOU MENTION ANYONE WHO'S BEEN\nPERSONALLY OFFENDED BY WHAT HE SAID, WILL HE REACH OUT TO THE\nKHAN FAMILY PERSONALLY? >> HE MAY, BUT I CERTAINLY HOPE\nTHEY HEARD HIM LAST NIGHT. AND I CERTAINLY HOPE AMERICA\nHEARD HIM LAST NIGHT BECAUSE OF ALL THE PEOPLE, DAVID, WHO'VE\nBEEN SAYING LET'S GET TRUMP TO PIVOT, BE MORE PRESIDENTIAL,\nTHAT IS PRESIDENTIAL. >> JOINING US NOW FROM NEW YORK,\nAMY HOLMES, POLITICAL ANALYST AND FORMER ANCHOR AT \"THE\nBLAZE,\" IN WASHINGTON, HEIDI, SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT\nFOR \"USA TODAY\" AND HERE IN LOS ANGELES, LESLIE MARSHAL, RADIO\nHOST AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR. HEIDI, WHEN MANAFORT STEPPED\nDOWN IN THE WAKE OF THE BIG SHAKEUP, YOU COULD SEE THE SPIN\nEVOLVE DURING THE DAY. TALK ABOUT SPIN CYCLE.\nFIRST IT WAS, OH, MANAFORT VOLUNTEERED TO DO THIS, IT WAS\nHIS IDEA, HE BROUGHT IN KELLYANNE, FELT LIKE HE COULDN'T\nBUDGE THE CANDIDATE. AND THEN OTHER SOURCES WERE\nHEARD FROM. EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED.\n>> HOWIE, THIS JUST STRUCK ME OF ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF TRUMP BEING\nPRESSURED TO USE WHAT IS REALLY A CONVENTIONAL CAMPAIGN TACTIC\nAND BY THE END SAYING THE HECK WITH IT.\nTHE DIGNIFIED WAY FOR CAMPAIGN MANAGERS OR ANYBODY ELSE REALLY\nON A CAMPAIGN TO LEAVE IS FOR EVERYBODY TO AGREE IT WAS\nVOLUNTARY, TRUMP ISSUES A STATEMENT SAYING WE ACCEPT HIS\nRESIGNATION AND THE MEDIA MOVES ON.\nMAYBE THEY WRITE SOME BACKGROUND STORIES ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE\nDISGRUNTLED. BUT LIKE YOU SAID, THIS WAS\nLITERALLY EVOLVING MINUTE BY MINUTE, AND YOU HAD KELLYANNE,\nTHE NEW CAMPAIGN ESSENTIALLY CONFIRMING HE WAS\nASKED TO LEAVE. IT'S NOT THESE THINGS CAN'T\nBE -- THAT BOTH SIDES AGREE MUTUALLY TO LEAVE.\nBUT I THINK THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE REALLY COMPETING\nINTERESTS TRYING TO SPIN THE INTERESTS HERE.\nCLEARLY MANAFORT WANTED TO PRESERVE HIS DIGNITY ON THE WAY\nOUT THE DOOR, AND TRUMP DIDN'T WANT THIS TO BE VIEWED AS A\nHEMORRHAGING. >> YOU CAN PRACTICALLY IMAGINING\nTHE REPORTERS SCRAMBLING TO REACH MORE SOURCES ON MANAFORT,\nSOME ANTI-MANAFORT AND GET SOME APPROXIMATION OF THE TRUTH.\nOF COURSE, AMY, WHEN THE SHAKEUP HAPPENS IT'S A BOMBSHELL FOR THE\nCAMPAIGN. PUNDITS REACTED SAYING IT\nDOESN'T REALLY MATTER, TRUMP IS THE PROBLEM.\nWAS THAT A BIT DISMISSIVE? >> I THINK IT WAS.\nAND WE'VE SEEN SINCE DONALD TRUMP HIRING KELLYANNE CONWAY\nTHAT HE HAS BEEN MAKING THIS PRESIDENTIAL PIVOT.\nIRONICALLY AFTER FIRING THE GUY THAT SAID IT WAS GOING TO\nHAPPEN, IT'S HAPPENED UNDER KELLYANNE BECOMING THE NEW\nCAMPAIGN MANAGER. WE'LL SEE IF IT LASTS.\nAND I, YOU KNOW, DONALD TRUMP WE KNOW HAS BEEN A VERY VOLATILE\nCANDIDATE. AND OF COURSE HE DESERVES MEDIA\nSCRUTINY, BUT I THINK HE ALSO DESERVES CREDIT FOR AT LEAST\nMAKING THESE INITIAL ATTEMPTS. >> BUT MOSTLY I WOULD SAY THE\nPRESS WAS EITHER PUZZLED BY THIS, LESLIE MARSHALL, OR\nNEGATIVE TOWARD IT. I KNOW YOU'RE NO TRUMP FAN, BUT\nHOW MUCH OF THE COVERAGE DO YOU THINK WAS INFLUENCED BY THE\nINCREASINGLY HOSTILE TONE IN THE PRESS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND HIS\nCANDIDACY? >> WELL, I THINK QUITE FRANKLY\nANY TIME TRUMP OPENED HIS MOUTH, EVERYBODY WOULD COVER IT BECAUSE\nHE'S GOOD FOR RATINGS. I MEAN, THAT'S THE REALITY AND\nTHAT'S A REAL BOTTOM LINE. I DON'T THINK TRUMP HAD ANY\nDISSERVICE. WE HAVE TO LOOK HISTORICALLY,\nTHIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST SHAKEUP WE'VE SEEN IN A\nPRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, AT LEAST IN THE MOST CURRENT ELECTIONS IN\nMODERN DAY. AND I THINK THERE WAS ALSO -- I\nMEAN, THERE WAS ADDITIONAL ELEMENT.\nIT WASN'T JUST THAT HE WAS TAKING A NOSE DIVE IN THE POLLS\nAND MAKING YET ANOTHER CHANGE IN HIS CAMPAIGN STAFF.\nBUT THERE WAS ALSO THE CONNECTIONS WITH RUSSIA AND THE\nUKRAINE AND EVEN THE QUESTION OF LEGALITY.\nI HEARD SOME HISTORIANS SAY BACK IN THE DAY THIS WOULD BE TREASON\nAND SOMEBODY WOULD BE HUNG FOR THIS.\n>> WE'LL COME BACK TO THE MANAFORT QUESTION.\nLET ME GET HEIDI IN ON THIS QUESTION.\nWE PLAYED IT AT THE TOP TRUMP GIVING A SCRIPTED SPEECH IN\nWHICH HE SAYS HE REGRETS SOME OF HIS PAST COMMENTS.\nAND I THINK IT WOULD BE FAIR TO SAY MOST OF THE PRESS REACTION\nWAS SKEPTICAL, DID HE REALLY MEAN IT OR WAS HE BEING FED\nTHESE LINES? >> THERE WAS DEFINITELY SOME\nSKEPTICISM. AND SOME OF IT EVEN BORDERED ON\nSNARK. I SAW ONE STORY SAY, WELL, IT\nWASN'T REALLY AN APOLOGY BECAUSE HE DIDN'T SAY THE WORD SORRY.\nBUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE WAS SOME LEGITIMATE REASONS FOR\nSKEPTICISM HERE. MOST OF ALL THIS IS JUST NOT IN\nCHARACTER FOR TRUMP BECAUSE HE'S BEEN ASKED ALONG THE WAY AS HE'S\nMADE THESE CONTROVERSIAL COMMENTS IF HE REGRETS THEM.\nAND EACH TIME HE SAID NO. IT ALSO COINCIDES ALMOST\nPERFECTLY WITH KELLYANNE COMING IN AS HIS NEW CAMPAIGN MANAGER\nKNOWING THAT SHE WANTED TO GIVE HIM -- TO SOFTEN UP HIS IMAGE A\nBIT. SO YOU QUESTION WHETHER THAT'S\nCOMING LEGITIMATELY FROM HIS HEART OR FROM HER FROM A\nCAMPAIGN PERSPECTIVE. THAT SAID, YOU KNOW, HE DID SAY\nTHE WORDS AND IT WAS A PRETTY BIG DEAL.\n>> RIGHT. RIGHT.\nWELL, KELLYANNE CONWAY SAID IN ONE OF HER MANY INTERVIEWS THIS\nWEEK THAT DONALD TRUMP WENT OVER THE SPEECH WITH A PEN.\nIT WASN'T HER WORDS. OF COURSE SHE'S GOING TO SAY\nTHAT. AMY, WHAT ABOUT THE FACT THAT\nTHE MEDIA, LOOK, LET'S FACE IT, THE MEDIA WERE STUNNED BECAUSE\nTRUMP NEVER APOLOGIZES FOR ANYTHING, ALTHOUGH HE WASN'T\nSPECIFIC ABOUT WHICH COMMENTS AND TO WHOM HE MIGHT BE\nEXPRESSING REGRET. >> RIGHT.\nAND DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF HAS SAID IT'S A PART OF HIS SORT OF\nLIFE STRATEGY TO ALWAYS HIT BACK AND ALWAYS RETALIATE, NEVER LET\nA CHARGE GO UNANSWERED. SO FOR HIM TO NOW BE OFFERING\nWHAT SEEMED TO BE AN APOLOGY OF COURSE WAS NEWSWORTHY AND NEWS\nMAKING. BUT FOR THE PRESS TO IMMEDIATELY\nDISMISS IT AND PSYCHOANALYZE DONALD TRUMP, I DON'T THINK\nTHAT'S FAIR EITHER. AND AT RASMUSSEN REPORTS THIS\nWEEK, WE RELEASED A POLL THAT FOUND 52% OF LIKELY VOTERS THINK\nTHAT THE MEDIA THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS GOT THE BEST MEDIA\nCOVERAGE SO FAR IN THIS CAMPAIGN.\n>> THE RELATED QUESTION HERE IS WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THE SORT OF\nMINIPIVOTS BEFORE WHERE TRUMP GIVES A COUPLE SCRIPTED\nSPEECHES, NOW HE'S A MORE DISCIPLINED CANDIDATE AND IT\nDOESN'T LAST. SO IS SKEPTICISM ON THIS ROUND\nJUSTIFIED? >> I THINK IT IS ABSOLUTELY\nJUSTIFIED. WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO SAYS,\nYOU KNOW, JUST HISTORICALLY, WHEN YOU LOOK BACK SOMEBODY JUST\nSAYS I'M CONCERNED IF I'VE HURT ANYONE LIKE YOU HAD SAID, THERE\nIS ONE NOTE ACTUAL SPECIFIC APOLOGY, TWO, THERE ARE NO\nSPECIFICS TO WHO HE HAS OFFENDED AND WHAT HE FEELS REMORSEFUL,\nYOU KNOW, HAS REGRET ABOUT. AND, I MEAN, THIS IS THE MAN\nTHAT TALKED ABOUT PUNCHING MICHAEL BLOOMBERG IN THE FACE.\nTHIS IS A MAN WHO CARED ABOUT HIMSELF AFTER THE ORLANDO\nTERRORIST ATTACKS AND ALSO FELT THAT A MAN WHOSE SON DIED FOR\nTHIS COUNTRY WAS ATTACKING HIM. AND THEN ATTACKED THE MOTHER FOR\nTHE SILENCE. >> YOU CAN CERTAINLY CRITICIZE\nTRUMP'S RESPONSE. EVERYBODY THINKS IT WAS A\nPOLITICAL MISTAKE, BUT HE WAS DENOUNCED BY MR. KHAN AT THE\nCONVENTION. THE \"NEW YORK TIMES,\" HEIDI, DID\nTHIS BIG PIECE, IT WAS THE FIRST OF SEVERAL PIECES OF HIS TIES --\nTHE GUY'S BEEN A LOBBYIST FOR YEARS TO UKRAINE AND HOW LEDGERS\nWERE DISCOVERED THAT SEEMED TO SHOW $12 MILLION IN CASH BEING\nEARMARKED FOR PAUL MANAFORT. MANAFORT'S VEHEMENTLY DENIED HE\nEVER RECEIVED ANY OF THAT MONEY. HE DENOUNCED \"NEW YORK TIMES.\"\nWHAT'D YOU MAKE OF THAT STORY? DIDN'T PROVE HE GOT THE\nPAYMENTS. WAS THAT STORY FAIR?\n>> I TOOK A GOOD READ, HOWIE, AND THIS IS MY ASSESSMENT.\n. I THINK THIS IS AN EXAMPLE THE\nNARRATIVE MAKES THIS STORY VERSUS SPECIFIC FACTS IN THIS\nSTORY. GOING INTO THIS WE ALL KNOW THAT\nMANAFORT HAD TIES TO BIG RUSSIAN MONEY AND TO YANUKOYVICH, WHO IN\nPARTICULAR IS AS CORRUPT AS THEY COME.\nSO GOING INTO THAT WE HAD THE PREFORMED CONFESSION.\nLOOK AT THE FACTS. THESE ARE HANDWRITTEN LETTERS,\nIT'S AN ASSERTION FROM A UKRAINIAN AGENCY THAT WE'RE NOT\nFAMILIAR WITH. MANAFORT COULD EASILY DENY IT.\nSO, YOU KNOW, EVEN LOWER DOWN IN THE STORY THE INVESTIGATORS HAD\nSAID THERE WAS NO PROOF HE ACTUALLY RECEIVED THE MONEY.\nSO THAT KIND OF BRINGS US BACK TO WHY IS THIS NEWS?\nWELL, THIS IS NEWS BECAUSE OF WHAT WE KNEW PREVIOUSLY WHICH IS\nTHERE IS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO MEN THAT IS TROUBLING\nIN AND OF ITSELF BECAUSE WHO YANUKOYVICH IS.\n>> YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE PRESS JUMP TO THE\nCONCLUSION, AMY, THAT IT WAS THESE STORIES ABOUT THE RUSSIAN\nTIES AND THE UKRAINIAN RELATIONSHIP THAT SUNK PAUL\nMANAFORT. I'M TOLD BY MY SOURCES THAT\nDONALD TRUMP WHILE NOT HAPPY ABOUT THAT DISTRACTION WAS MUCH\nMORE UPSET WITH THE STORY WE TALKED ABOUT LAST SUNDAY WHICH\nWAS BIG LEAKY \"NEW YORK TIMES\" PIECE, HIS OWN ADVISOR SAYING\nDONALD TRUMP IS NOT COACHABLE AND PERHAPS CONCLUDED MANAFORT'S\nWERE FAIRLY ON THAT PIECE. >> WELL, I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED\nIF THAT WAS THE CASE THAT DONALD TRUMP DID NOT LIKE HAVING THESE\nLEAKS IN THE PRESS THAT HE CAN'T BE TAMED.\nBUT I THINK GETTING BACK TO THE RUSSIA STORY, PART OF ALSO WHAT\nFUELED THE MEDIA COVERAGE OF THAT IS THAT IT DOVETAILED WITH\nTHE VLADIMIR PUTIN/DONALD TRUMP STEAMY BROMANCE AND THE KIND\nWORDS THEY'VE HAD FOR EACH OTHER.\nBUT IF YOU LOOK AT THESE ARTICLES TOO, YOU NOTICE BURIED\nWAY DOWN IN THE PRINT WAS THAT THE PADESTA GROUP, HILLARY\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN MANAGER'S BROTHER, THEY'RE ALSO UNDER\nSCRUTINY. BUT LOOKING AT MSM, MAINSTREAM\nMEDIA, YOU WOULD THINK IT WAS ONLY ABOUT PAUL MANAFORT.\n>> RIGHT. I JUST WANT TO CLOSE THIS\nSEGMENT ASKING YOU, LESLIE, ABOUT JUST THE VOLUME, GUSHER OF\nANTI-TRUMP HEADLINES VERSUS THOSE INVOLVING HILLARY CLINTON.\nPIVOT 107 DAYS LATE. \"NEW YORK TIMES,\" IN TRUMP'S IN\nDEBT, GOP WORRIES ALL BODES. BUT TODAY ON THE FRONT PAGE,\nWITH A COMFORTABLE LEAD CLINTON BEGINS LAYING PLANS FOR HER\nWHITE HOUSE AGENDA, ALMOST AS IF THE RACE WAS OVER.\n>> I'VE SAID IT BEFORE, I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT THAT ANY OUTLET\nIS NOT REPORTING ALL THE FACTS. THAT'S WHAT A TRUE JOURNALISTIC\nSOURCE SHOULD DO. BUT AGAIN, QUITE FRANKLY, DIRT\nON DONALD, ANYTHING ABOUT DONALD JUST IS MORE ATTRACTIVE TO\nREADERS AND TO VIEWERS AND TO LISTENERS THAN INFORMATION ABOUT\nHILLARY CLINTON. AND SO IF IT BLEEDS, IT LEADS,\nOR IF IT HAS DONALD TRUMP'S NAME IN IT IT LEADS.\n>> TRUE. BEFORE WE GO TO BREAK, THE NEW\nYORK DAILY NEWS COVER SUPPOSEDLY TRUMP SAYING I'M GOING TO LOSE\nSO GOOD. THIS PIECE ACTUALLY SAYS THAT\nHIS SHAKEUP COULD BE AN INTENTIONAL EFFORT TO TANK THE\nELECTION IN SPECTACULAR FASHION. TALK ABOUT A COMPLETELY\nUNSUPPORTED PAR SPECULATION. YOU CAN WRITE TO US\nATMEDIABUZZ.COM. WHEN WE COME BACK, CLOSER LOOK\nAT THE CONTROVERSIAL BREITBART MEDIA OPERATION THAT PRODUCED\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN'S NEW CEO. AND LATER, THE PASSING OF JOHN\nMcWHO INFLUENCED NUCH OF WHAT YOU SEE TODAY ON CABLE NEWS.                  They feel good?      No...",

SHE'S BEEN INTERVIEWING THE\nCONTRACTORS IN AFGHANISTAN. GREAT TO SEE YOU THIS MORNING.\n>> GREAT TO SEE YOU, TOO, TUCKER.\n>> THE U.S. GOVERNMENT USES CONTRACTORS AROUND THE WORLD\nBECAUSE IT'S CHEAPER. SOME ARE GREAT.\nTHEY'RE NOT MAKING PLANS THE WAY THEY WOULD FOR U.S. MILITARY\nEMPLOYEES TO BE EVACUATED, HELPED OR RESCUED IN THE CASE OF\nATTACKS. WHY?\n>> WELL, IT'S MANDATED, TUCKER. IT'S AN EXECUTIVE ORDER.\nTHE STATE DEPARTMENT IS IN CHARGE OF EVACUATION PLANS, NOT\nONLY FOR CIVILIAN CONTRACTORS THAT ARE WORKING WITH THE D.O.D.\nBUT FOR ALL CIVILIANS WORKING IN HOT ZONES.\nTHOSE ARE AREAS LIKE UNDER GREAT DURESS, LIKE AFGHANISTAN, LIKE\nWE'VE SEEN IN IRAQ, LIKE WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER PLACES LIKE LIBYA\nAND BENGHAZI. IT IS MANDATED BY EXECUTIVE\nORDER THAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAVE A PLAN IN PLACE TO EVACUATE\nTHESE PERSONNEL IF SOMETHING GOES SOUTH, IF SOMETHING GOES\nWRONG. THE GENTLEMAN THAT WAS SPEAKING\nHEADS THE CRISIS ADVISORY SUBCOMMITTEE IN KABUL FOR WHO?\nFOR THE STATE DEPARTMENT. SO HE'S COMING ON THE RECORD\nSAYING, LOOK, WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING WE CAN.\nWE HAVE TRIED TALKING TO THEM AT THE EMBASSY.\nWE'VE TRIED TALKING TO THEM HERE IN THE STATES AND NOBODY HAS\nSHOWN US AN EVACUATION PLAN FOR THE PERSONNEL INSIDE\nAFGHANISTAN. >> PRETTY UPSETTING.\nA LOT OF THESE CONTRACTORS ARE FORMER U.S. MILITARY, PATRIOTIC\nAMERICANS. GOOD PEOPLE.\n1600 HAVE BEEN KILLED SINCE THE WAR BEGAN IN AFGHANISTAN IN LATE\n2001. WHY EXACTLY DO YOU THINK THE\nU.S. GOVERNMENT ISN'T FOCUSING ON THIS?\n>> WELL, AND JUST TO ADD TO THAT, SEVERAL DAYS AFTER MY\nSTORY BROKE CRS, A CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE REPORT CAME OUT\nTHAT SAID THERE ARE 29,000 U.S. CONTRACTORS IN AFGHANISTAN\nCOMPARED TO WHAT'S GOING TO BE 8300 --\n>> WHOA. >> YES, 8300 MILITARY PERSONNEL\nBY THE END OF THE YEAR. 83, 8400 BY THE END OF THE YEAR.\nSO THINK ABOUT THAT. THOSE NUMBERS, TENS OF THOUSANDS\nOF CONTRACTORS. AND THEY DON'T HAVE AN\nEXPLANATION. WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT ONE OF\nTHE CONTRACTORS THAT I SPOKE WITH ON THE RECORD SAID THEY DID\nSEE A VERY ABYSMAL PLAN LATE LAST YEAR AND THAT VERY HIGH\nLEVEL STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS IN AFGHANISTAN WERE SUPER\nCONCERNED ABOUT THIS, BUT NOBODY GOT ANYTHING DONE.\nSO THERE REALLY IS NO REASON WHY THEY SHOULDN'T HAVEDONE.\nTHEY HAVE THE PEOPLE AND THE MAN POWER IN PLACE TO PREPARE FOR AN\nEVACUATION PLAN AND TO SHARE THOSE EVACUATION PLANS WITH THE\nPEOPLE THAT NEED TO KNOW. >> 29,000.\nTHERE'S A LOT GOING ON THAT THE AVERAGE AMERICAN DOESN'T KNOW\nABOUT. >> THAT'S RIGHT.\n>> THANKS A LOT FOR BRINGING THIS STORY TO US.\nI APPRECIATE IT.",

THIS IS GOOD NEWS.\nWE ARE 73% CONTAINMENT AND IMPROVING FROM HERE.\nAT ONE POINT, THIS PARTICULAR BLUE CUT FIRE WAS EXPLOSIVE.\nIT'S A TERM WE USE TO DISCUSS VERY RAPIDLY EXPANDING WILDFIRE.\nAT ONE POINT, IT WAS BURNING THE EQUIVALENT OF 500 FOOTBALL\nFIELDS PER HOUR, A SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN THIS FIRE.\nTHAT'S BECAUSE THEY ARE TINDERBOX CONDITIONS ACROSS THIS\nPART OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING,\nTHOUGH, COMPARING LAST YEAR TO THIS YEAR, OVER FROM THE\nBEGINNING OF THE YEAR TO THE CURRENT DATE, WE ARE SEEING A\nSIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN FOREST FIRES.\nWE ARE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS SEASON.\nWE ANTICIPATE FOREST FIRES TO CONTINUE OVER THE WESTERN U.S.\nA QUICK UPDATE ON LOUISIANA FLOODING.\nVERY ISOLATED SHOWERS AND STORMS TODAY.\nMAYBE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE FLOODWATER TO RECEDE.\nLOOK TO THE WEST. FLASH FLOOD WARNINGS FOR SAN\nANTONIO AND SOUTH OF THE AUSTIN REGION.\nGEORGE, YOU KNOW THIS AREA VERY WELL.\nFLOODING IS A MAJOR CONCERN FOR TEXAS, TO SAY THE LEAST.\nTHE FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL BRING MORE RAIN.\n>> LOUISIANA ALREADY DOING THE BEST.\nPEOPLE TRYING TO RECOVER FROM THE RAIN THEY GOT.\n>> IT'S BEEN A ROUGH TEN DAYS FOR THEM.\n>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.",
