HE KILLED HIMSELF LAST WEEK ON\nFRIDAY MORNING. AND YET IN A TRULY BIZARRE TURN\nOF EVENTS IN THIS OTHERWISE TRAGIC STORY, LOCAL REPUBLICAN\nLEADERS IN NEW YORK URGED VOTERS IN HIS DISTRICT THAT THEY SHOULD\nSTILL VOTE FOR THE DEAD MAN, EVEN THOUGH HE IS DEAD.\nMR. NOJAY, THE TRUMP CO-CHAIR, HE DID HAVE A REPUBLICAN\nCHALLENGER IN THAT RACE YESTERDAY.\nYOU WOULD THINK THAT MAN WOULD HAVE HAD AN ADVANTAGE IN THE\nRACE GIVEN THAT HIS OPPONENT DIED SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE\nELECTION DAY. BUT THE NEW YORK STATE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY TOLD VOTERS TO PICK THE DEAD MAN IN THAT RACE\nRATHER THAN HIS LIVE OPPONENT. THE VOTERS OBLIGED.\nTHE DEAD MAN WON WITH 61% OF THE VOTE.\nAND NOW, NOW THAT THE VOTERS CHOSE THE DEAD GUY OVER THE LIVE\nGUY TO BE THEIR REPRESENTATIVE, NOW THE SAME PARTY LEADERS WHO\nPUSHED FOR THAT CHOICE NOW NOT INCIDENTALLY THEY GET TO CHOOSE\nMR. NOJAY'S REPLACEMENT ON THE EARLY BALLOT.\nAND EARLY REPORTS SOUND LIKE THEY ARE NOT GOING TO PICK THE\nLIVE GUY WHO ACTUALLY RAN. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO PICK THE\nRUNNER-UP.

DONALD TRUMP MUST WIN OHIO, AT\nTHE MOMENT, HE'S UP FIVE POINTS, 46% TO 41% FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHE THIRD-PARTY CANDIDATES GETTING A COMBINED TEN.\nWHY IS THIS HAPPENING? HERE'S ONE REASON, IN OTHER\nBATTLEGROUND STATES HILLARY CLINTON HAS BENEFITED BY WINNING\nAMONG COLLEGE-EDUCATED VOTERS. IN OHIO,\nDONALD TRUMP HAS A LEAD AND HE'S TROUNCING HILLARY CLINTON AMONG\nWHITE CLASS WORKING VOTERS. HILLARY CLINTON IS LOSING THESE\nVOTERS. IT IS A PLUS FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nHILLARY CLINTON NEEDS A GENDER GAP AND NEEDS TO WIN IT UP BIG\nWITH WOMEN VOTERS BECAUSE THE REPUBLICAN USUALLY WINS AMONG\nMEN. ONLY A TWO-POINT ADVANTAGE FOR\nSECRETARY CLINTON IN THIS OHIO POLL WITH WOMEN.\nTHAT'S A PROBLEM FOR HER. LET'S MOVE SOUTH TO THE BIGGEST\nBATTLEGROUND IN TERMS OF ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES, 29,\nFLORIDA, AND THE NUMBERS LOOK SIMILAR.\nTHIS ONE'S A LITTLE BIT TIGHTER INSIDE THE MARGIN OF ERROR, 44%\n-- 37% FOR TRUMP, AND 44 FOR CLINTON.\nTHIS IS THE CLOSEST RACE BETWEEN SINCE 2012 BETWEEN OBAMA AND\nROMNEY. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THIS\nEDUCATION GAP WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER BATTLEGROUND STATES,\nNOT LIKE HERE IN FLORIDA. DONALD TRUMP WINNING AMONG WHITE\nCOLLEGE GRADUATES AND TROUNCING WHITE COLLEGE EDUCATED VOTERS.\nONE OTHER POINT, HILLARY CLINTON IS THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE\nTRYING TO SUCCEED A TWO-TERM DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT.\nIF THE PRESIDENT'S DISAPPROVAL RATING IS A MAJORITY AS IT IS IN\nOHIO AND FLORIDA -- THEY DON'T LIKE THE PRESIDENT SO MUCH.\nHE IS UNDER WATER IN POLITICS, IN OTHER STATES WE'VE\nSEEN THE PRESIDENT ABOVE 50%, SHE DOES BETTER SO THE OBAMA\nMATTERS, AS WELL. SO POLLS IN OHIO, HOW DO THEY\nEFFECT THE ELECTORAL MAP, IF THE ELECTION WERE TODAY, SECRETARY\nCLINTON WOULD WIN. DARK BLUE IS SOLID DEMOCRAT.\nSO IF DONALD TRUMP WON FLORIDA AND OHIO, BASED ON THOSE NEW\nPOLLS, THERE'S NEW POLL SHOWING HIM WINNING IN NEVADA, EVEN THAT\nWOULD NOT BE ENOUGH FOR DONALD TRUMP TO WIN THE UPON\nPRESIDENCY, HE HAS TO TURN ONE OF THOSE BLUE STATES RED.\nVIRGINIA, MICHIGAN, PENNSYLVANIA, WATCH IF\nWE SEE MORE STATE POLLING.

HOW WORRIED, GLORIA, SHOULD\nHILLARY CLINTON BE ABOUT THESE BATTLEGROUND NUMBERS?\n>> WORRIED. AND I THINK THEY ARE WORRIED\nABOUT THEM. SHE HAD A BIG BOUNCE COMING OUT\nOF HER CONVENTION. IT'S CLEAR EVAPORATED MORE OR\nLESS, AND BATTLEGROUND STATES TEND TO RISE AND FALL TOGETHER\nAND SHE'S HAVING A LITTLE PROBLEM WITH THEM RIGHT NOW.\nI WAS LOOKING AT SOME OF THE INTERNALS IN THE POLL NUMBERS\nJOHN WAS TALKING ABOUT IN FLORIDA AND OHIO.\nWHAT STRUCK ME WAS HOW BEHIND SHE WAS COMPARED TO BARACK OBAMA\nIN 2012 WITH YOUNGER VOTERS. SHE'S 13 POINTS BEHIND WHERE HE\nWAS IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA.

WHAT DOES SHE NEED TO DO TO TURN\nTHIS AROUND? AND CAN SHE?\n>> WIN THE FIRST DEBATE. EVERYTHING IS GOING TO COME TO\nTHAT DEBATE. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME\nBACK-AND-FORTH'ING OVER THE NEXT 12 DAYS OR SO.\nTHAT FIRST DEBATE BECOMES ALL IMPORTANT.\nA COUPLE THINGS, DON. IN THE BACKGROUND HERE, IS THAT\nAS YOU SAY, HE'S RUNNING A MUCH MORE DISCIPLINED AND SMARTER\nCAMPAIGN, MORE INTERESTING EVENTS THAN WHAT HE'S HAD IN THE\nPAST, AND I THINK THAT HAS HELPED HIM.\nBUT ALSO, THIS -- BOTH CANDIDATES HAVE ALLOWED THIS\nCAMPAIGN TO DRIFT OVER AND CENTER ON THE QUESTION AMONG THE\nPOPULOUS, WHICH ONE DO YOU TRUST MORE?\nWHICH ONE DO YOU LIKE MORE AND THAT'S THE BASIS ON WHICH YOU'RE\nGOING TO VOTE. SHE COULD EASILY LOSE THAT\nQUESTION. WHAT SHE CAN WIN ON IS WHO IS\nGOING TO DO MORE FOR THE COUNTRY WHO HAS AN AGENDA FOR THE FUTURE\nBOTH HOME AND ABROAD THAT'S GOING TO MAKE\nYOU MORE SAFER AND PROSPEROUS. SHE HAS A BETTER CHANCE OF\nWINNING THAT ON THE SUBSTANCE THAN ON THE LIKABILITY\nSITUATION. >> DONALD TRUMP HAD A RALLY AND\nTALKED ABOUT CLINTON'S HEALTH. LISTEN TO THIS.\n>> DO YOU THINK THIS IS EASY? OH, YOU THINK THIS IS SO EASY?\nIN THIS BEAUTIFUL ROOM THAT'S 122 DEGREES?\nIT IS HOT AND IT'S ALWAYS HOT WHEN I PERFORM BECAUSE THE\nCROWDS ARE SO BIG. I DON'T KNOW, FOLKS.\nYOU THINK HILLARY WOULD BE ABLE TO STAND UP HERE FOR AN HOUR AND\nDO THIS? I DON'T KNOW.\nI DON'T KNOW. I DON'T THINK SO.\nI DON'T THINK SO. >> NOT A GOOD LOOK, GLORIA?\n>> NOT A GOOD LOOK. FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T THINK IT'S\nEVER A GREAT IDEA TO COMPLAIN TO THE VOTERS HOW TOUGH YOUR JOB\nIS WHEN YOU RUN FOR PRESIDENT, I THINK THAT'S WHAT HE WAS\nDOING.

CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT LOOKS\nAT THE NUMBERS. >> TWO CNN POLLS, TWO\nBATTLEGROUND STATES, DONALD TRUMP HAS MOMENTUM FOR\nPRESIDENT. IN THE STATE OF OHIO, NO\nREPUBLICAN WINS WITHOUT IT. DONALD TRUMP MUST WIN OHIO, AT\nTHE MOMENT, HE'S UP FIVE POINTS, 46% TO 41% FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHE THIRD-PARTY CANDIDATES GETTING A COMBINED TEN.\nWHY IS THIS HAPPENING? HERE'S ONE REASON, IN OTHER\nBATTLEGROUND STATES HILLARY CLINTON HAS BENEFITED BY WINNING\nAMONG COLLEGE-EDUCATED VOTERS. DONALD TRUMP HAS A LEAD AND HE'S\nTROUNSING HILLARY CLINTON AMONG WHITE CLASS WORKING VOTERS.\nONE INTERESTING POINT IN OHIO, HILLARY CLINTON NEEDS A GENDER\nGAP AND NEEDS TO WIN IT UP BIG WITH WOMEN VOTERS BECAUSE THE\nREPUBLICAN USUALLY WINS AMONG MEN.\nONLY A TWO-POINT ADVANTAGE FOR SECRETARY CLINTON IN THIS OHIO\nPOLL, THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR HER. LET'S MOVE SOUTH TO THE BIGGEST\nBATTLEGROUND IN TERMS OF ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES, 29,\nFLORIDA, AND THE NUMBERS LOOK SIMILAR.\nTHIS ONE'S A LITTLE BIT TIGHTER INSIDE THE MARGIN OF ERROR, 44%\nFOR TRUMP AND 47% FOR CLINTON. THIS IS THE CLOSEST RACE BETWEEN\nOBAMA AND ROMNEY AND IF YOU LOOK AT THIS EDUCATION GAP WE'VE SEEN\nIN OTHER BATTLEGROUND STATES, NOT LIKE HERE IN FLORIDA.\nDONALD TRUMP WINNING AMONG WHITE COLLEGE GRADUATES AND TROUNCING\nWHITE COLLEGE EDUCATED VOTERS. ONE OTHER POINT, HILLARY CLINTON\nIS THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE TRYING TO SUCCEED A TWO-TERM\nDEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT. IF THE PRESIDENT'S DISAPPROVAL\nRATING IS LIKE OHIO AND AUTHORIZE, HE'S UNDER WATER IN\nPOLITICS, IN OTHER STATES WE'VE SEEN THE PRESIDENT ABOVE 50%,\nSHE DOES BETTER SO THE OBAMA MATTERS, AS WELL.\nSO POLLS IN OHIO, HOW DO THEY EFFECT THE ELECTORAL MAP, IF THE\nELECTION WERE TODAY, SECRETARY CLINTON WOULD WIN.\nDARK BLUE IS SOLID DEMOCRAT. SO IF DONALD TRUMP WON FLORIDA\nAND OHIO, BASED ON THOSE NEW POLLS, THERE'S NEW POLL SHOWING\nHIM WINNING IN NEVADA, EVEN THAT WOULD NOT BE ENOUGH FOR DONALD\nTRUMP TO WIN THE UPON PRESIDENCY, HE HAS TO TURN ONE\nOF THOSE BLUE STATES RED.

THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYONE.\nHOW WORRIED, GLORIA, SHOULD HILLARY CLINTON BE ABOUT THESE\nBATTLEGROUND NUMBERS? >> WORRIED.\nAND I THINK THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT THEM.\nSHE HAD A BIG BOUNCE COMING OUT OF HER CONVENTION.\nIT'S CLEAR EVAPORATED MORE OR LESS, AND BATTLEGROUND STATES\nTEND TO RISE AND FALL TOGETHER AND SHE'S HAVING A LITTLE\nPROBLEM WITH THEM RIGHT NOW. I WAS LOOKING AT SOME OF THE\nINTERNALS IN THE POLL NUMBERS JOHN WAS TALKING ABOUT IN\nFLORIDA AND OHIO. WHAT STRUCK ME WAS HOW BEHIND\nSHE WAS COMPARED TO BARACK OBAMA WITH YOUNGER VOTERS.\nSHE'S 13 POINTS BEHIND WHERE HE WAS IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA.\nTHAT'S A LOT. >> AND THAT HELPED HIM WIN.\n>> IT REALLY HELPED HIM WIN. SHE NEEDS TO GET BERNIE SANDERS\nOUT THERE ON THE TRAIL, HELPING HER WITH THOSE YOUNGER VOTERS.\n>> ON THE DOUBLE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NATIONAL\nPOLLS, MARK, AND CNN'S POLL SHOWING OHIO AND FLORIDA TRUMP\nLEADS, SHE'LOST A LOT OF GROUND. SHE'S KIND OF STABILIZED WHERE\nHE'S AT. SHE HAS REALLY DROPPED.\n>> SHE WAS UP EIGHT COMING UP OUT OF THE CONVENTION\nNATIONALLY, AND THAT TRACKED WITH THE BATTLEGROUND STATES BUT\nWHAT WE'RE SEEING AND NOT ONLY IN OUR TWO POLLS, IN IOWA AND\nNEVADA, THAT ARE NOT GOOD AT ALL FOR HILLARY CLINTON AT THIS\nPOINT, IT'S ALL TRENDING RIGHT NOW, AND WHILE THERE'S 55 DAYS\nLEFT, AND CLEARLY WHAT WE SAW FROM JOHN RIGHT THERE, SHE WOULD\nWIN TODAY GIVEN THE ELECTORAL MAP, THE TREND IS NOT GOING HER\nWAY. >> ARE WE SEEING PEOPLE WHO YOU\nKNOW WERE MAYBE A LITTLE BIT ADVERSE TO DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE\nTHEY WEREN'T SO SURE ABOUT HIM AND NOW HE'S SORT OF APPEARS TO\nHAVE STABILIZED WITH THIS NEW TEAM, THAT THESE ARE REPUBLICANS\nWHO ARE COMING ON BOARD SAYING OKAY MAYBE WE CAN --\n>> I THINK WE'RE SEEING A NATURAL COMING TOGETHER OF A\nREPUBLICAN PARTY THAT HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY FRACTURED THROUGHOUT\nTHE WHOLE YEAR. >> DAVID, CLINTON HAS HAD A\nROUGH FEW WEEKS SINCE TRUMP CHANGED HIS CAMPAIGN TEAM.\nHE'S BEEN POUNDING HER ON THE FOUNDATION, THE E-MAILS, LARGELY\nAVOIDING MAKING MAJOR MISTAKES AND SHE HAD THIS DEPLORABLES\nCOMMENT AND THE PNEUMONIA EPI\nEPISODE, WHAT AND CAN SHE DO TO TURN THIS AROUND?\n>> WIN THE FIRST DEBATE. EVERYTHING IS GOING TO COME TO\nTHAT DEBATE. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME BACK\nAND FORTHING OVER THE NEXT 12 DAYS OR SO.\nTHAT FIRST DEBATE BECOMES ALL IMPORTANT.\nIN THE BACKGROUND HERE, IS THAT AS YOU SAY, HE'S RUNNING A MUCH\nMORE DISCIPLINED AND SMARTER CAMPAIGN, MORE INTERESTING\nEVENTS THAN WHAT HE'S HAD IN THE PAST, AND I THINK THAT HAS\nHELPED HIM. BUT ALSO, THIS -- BOTH\nCANDIDATES HAVE ALLOWED THIS CAMPAIGN TO DRIFT OVER AND\nCENTER ON THE QUESTION AMONG THE POPULOUS, WHICH ONE DO YOU TRUST\nMORE? WHICH ONE DO YOU LIKE MORE AND\nTHAT'S THE BASIS ON WHICH YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE.\nSHE COULD EASILY LOSE THAT QUESTION.\nWHAT SHE CAN WIN ON IS WHO IS GOING TO DO MORE FOR THE COUNTRY\nAND WHO HAS AN AGENDA AT HOME",

THIS IS A SHIFT.\nIN THE NATIONAL POLLS WE'VE SEEN INCREDIBLE TIGHTENING AND NOW\nHERE IN BATTLE GROUND STATES TRUMP IS ACTUALLY AHEAD.\nWHY? >> LET'S LOOK CLOSER AT THE\nNUMBERS. LET'S LOOK AT THE HORSE RACE YOU\nMENTIONED. TRUMP FIVE POINTS IN OHIO.\nTHE THIRD PARTY CANDIDATES ARE BRINGING DOWN THE WINNING LINE,\nTHE FINISH LINE. CAN TRUMP GET FIFTY IN OHIO?\nMOST THINK KNOW. BUT CAN HE GET 45, 46?\nIF THAT IS ENOUGH TO WIN HE'S A PLAY IN OHIO.\nCOUPLE WEEKS AGO. HILLARY CLINTON WAS WINNING\nAMONG WHITE COLLEGE GRADUATES. LOOK AT THIS.\nWHITE COLLEGE GRADUATES IN OHIO, TRUMP IS WINNING BY NINE POINTS\nAND HE'S SWAMPING HER AMONG WHITE NON COLLEGE GRADS.\nTHE WHITE WORKS CLASS. AND ONE OTHER POINT HERE INSIDE\nOF OHIO. LOOK AT THIS NUMBER, 44-42 AMONG\nWOMEN. SHE NEEDS A GENDER GAP.\nA BIG LEAD AMONG WOMEN TO OFF SET THIS.\nHE'S NOT GETTING IT IN OHIO. AN CONSERVATIVE STATE.\nAND FLORIDA PRETTY MUCH THE SAME.\nFLORIDA, THIS IS INSIDE THE MARGIN OF ERROR.\nAND THE GENDER GAP A LITTLE BETTER AMONG WOMEN HERE.\nBEAT BADLY AMONG MEN THERE. AND AGAIN IN FLORIDA.\nDONALD TRUMP WINNING AMONG WHITE COLLEGE GRADUATES.\nTHIS IS A WIG DEAL IF THIS WINS. AND ONE OTHER POINT.\nTHESE ARE CONSERVATIVE BATTLE GROUND STATES.\nOHIO AND FLORIDA. THE PRESIDENT IS UNDER WATER.\nT .\n>> SO TWO CRUCIAL BATTLEGROUND STATES THAT HAVE LEANED\nCONSERVATIVE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OVERALL\nMATH. THE PATH TO 270, WHO HAS THE\nADVANTAGE. >> LET'S CHANGE.\nIF YOU ARE A DEMOCRAT, YOU COULD SAY THIS CHANGES NOTHING AT ALL.\nAS OF TODAY WE HAVE HILLARY CLINTON AT 273.\nTHAT IS ENOUGH. AND EVEN IF DONALD TRUMP WON\nFLORIDA AND WON OHIO, WE JUST SHOWED YOU THOSE.\nTHERE IS EVEN A NEW POLL SHOWING HIM PLUS TWO IN NEVADA.\nFOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT GIVE HIM ALL THREE.\nHILLARY CLINTON CAN WIN WITHOUT FLORIDA AND WITHOUT OHIO.\nSO DONALD TRUMP HAS TO TURN SOMETHING THAT'S BLUE HERE.\nMAYBE A MICHIGAN, MAYBE A PENNSYLVANIA.\nMAYBE A VIRGINIA. DONALD TRUMP CAN'T JUST WIN OHIO\nAND FLORIDA.

FOR SO LONG THE DISCUSSION WAS\nWHITE COLLEGE GRADUATES THAT IS NOT TRUMP LAND.\nIF YOU ARE STARTING TO SEE THAT IN TRUE CRUCIAL STATES HAS THE\nMOMENTUM SHIFTED? >> THE RACE HAS TIGHTENED AND\nDEMOCRATS WILL CERTAINLY TELL YOU THE POLLING IS MUCH CLOSER\nTHAN THEY WOULD LIKE IT TO BE. I THINK MUCH CLOSER THAN WHAT\nSOME PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE.\nWHAT THEY HAVE SEEN IS TRUMP WILL HAVE A BAD WEEK.\nBUT THEN HIS NUMBERS WILL TAKE A DIP AND THEN THEY WILL RESTORE.\nREPUBLICANS ARE LOOKING FOR A REASON TO VOTE FOR THE\nREPUBLICAN. DEMOCRATS ARE LOOKING FOR A\nREASON TO VOTE FOR THE DEMOCRAT. AND THEN YOU HAVE GILL STEIN AND\nGARY JOHNSON WHERE YOU ARE SEEING SHROFFING OFF OF VOTES\nTOWARDS THEM. TRUMP HAS RUN A BETTER CAMPAIGN.\nHE'S RUN A MORE DISCIPLINED CAMPAIGN.\nIN THE LAST FOUR WEEKES HE'S DONE A LOT BETTER.\nIT'S STILL TO BE SEEN IF HE CAN OVERCOME SOME ISSUES ABOUT RACE\nAND OTHERS BUT IF HE CAN GET TO THAT HE COULD MAKE A SHIFT.\nPENNSYLVANIA IS A SOURCE OF CONCERN TO A LOT OF DEMOCRATS.\n>> AND ON THAT PART MARK WE TALK ABOUT JOHN WAS TALKING ABOUT\nWOMEN AND TALKING ABOUT COLLEGE GRADUATE, AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN\nLEFT FOR DEAD FOR TRUMP OBVIOUSLY IN FLORIDA AND OHIO.\nFAR FROM IT. HE'S LEADING.\nINDEPENDENTS. HE'S LEADING TEN POINTS IN\nFLORIDA. EIGHT POINTS IN OHIO.\n>> WHICH IS A SHIFT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST THIRTY DAYS.\nTHESE ARE THE VOTERS WHO ARE GOING TO ULTIMATELY DECIDE WHO\nWINS THE EBB ELECTION. WE TALKED ABOUT TURNOUT BUT BOTH\nPARTIES HAVE TO GET THE TURNOUT. THEY HAVE TO GET THE BASE OUT.\nWHICH IS WHY IT WAS SO IMPORTANT FOR BARACK OBAMA TO HIT THE\nCAMPAIGN TRAIL, SPECIFICALLY IF PENNSYLVANIA.\nVERY IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO GET OUT THERE.\nHERE A BIG PROBLEM FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nIF YOU LOOK AT FLORIDA RIGHT. NOW SHE'S ONLY UP SIX POINTS\nWITH VOTERS UNDER 45. AND IT IS BASICALLY EVEN IN\nOHIO. THAT IS CONSTITUENCY THAT\nPROPELLED BARACK OBAMA TO TWO TERMS AND IS PART OF THE\nCOALITION HILLARY CLINTON NEEDS IN BIG NUMBERS IN ORDER TO WIN.\n>> AND WHAT ABOUT GARY JOHNSON AND JILL STEIN?\nSPECIFICALLY GARY JOHNSON.

MOLLY, AS YOU LOOK AT ALL OF\nTHIS, WHERE DOES THE RACE SEEM TO YOU TO BE.\n>> I THINK WHAT THESE POLLS SHOW IS THAT AMERICANS HAVE\nKNOWN SINCE HILLARY CLINTON RAN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2008\nSHE IS A TERRIFICALLY AWFUL CANDIDATE.\nSHE IS STRUGGLING EVEN WITH ALL THE HELP SHE IS GETTING\nFROM THE POLITICAL AND MEDIA ESTABLISHMENT WHO ARE TRYING\nTO SORT OF DRAG HER ACROSS THE FINISH LINE.\nTHE UNDERLYING DYNAMIC WE HAVE SEEN.\n>> WHEN YOU SAY SHE IS AN AWFUL CANDIDATE, YOU MEAN AN\nAWFUL CANDIDATE FOR THE OFFICE OR AN AWFUL\nCAMPAIGNER OR BOTH. >> JUST AS A CAMPAIGNER.\nSHE HAS A LOT OF TROUBLE.

EXACTLY RIGHT.\nGO AHEAD, MOLLY. >> THESE POLLS ARE ALSO IN\nRACES WHERE YOU ARE SEEING A MICROCOSM OF THE OVERALL\nRACE. THESE ISSUES ARE REALLY\nIMPORTANT TO VOTERS. THEY ARE NOT BEING DISCUSSED\nAS MUCH IN THE NATIONAL MEDIA WHICH WANTS TO TALK\nABOUT OTHER ISSUES. WHEN YOU LOOK AT\nIMMIGRATION, ECONOMIC SECURITY, NATIONAL SECURITY,\nTHESE ARE THINGS THAT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT, VOTERS IN NEVADA\nAND VOTERS IN OHIO CARE ABOUT.\nYOU ARE SEEING THAT SHIFT IN THE POLLS AS PEOPLE -- AS\nTHE UNDERLYING FUNDAMENTALS OF THE RACE CONTINUE TO BE\nABOUT THINGS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE\nNATIONAL CONVERSATION IS. >> AND ALSO THE -- I MEAN,\nIF YOU LOOK AT THE NATIONAL NUMBERS, A MONTH AGO HILLARY\nCLINTON HAD AN 8 POINT LEAD IN THE REAL CLEAR POLITICS\nAVERAGE OF POLLS.

WAY TOO EARLY, AND SMART FOLKS\nLIKE YOU REMIND ME THAT THINGS CHANGE A LOT, BUT THAT WASN'T\nSUPPOSED TO BE THE CASE. SUDDENLY IT IS.\n>> YEAH, I THINK A LOT OF IT WAS THIS GRADUAL END OF HER\nCONVENTION BOUNCE, BUT STILL THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE GOING\nAWAY ABOUT TWO OR THREE WEEK AGO.\nTHERE HAS BEEN MORE QUESTION BEING HER HEALTH, OF COURSE, I\nDON'T KNOW HOW BIG OF AN IMPACT THAT IS HAVING, BUT WE'LL\nCONTINUE TO SEE TRANSPARENCY QUESTIONS ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON,\nAND IT COMES BACK TO THAT VERY CLEAR HONEST AND TRUST WORTHY\nQUESTION WITH HER.

TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nTHAT IS A SHOCKING CONDEMNATION. >> WE HAVE MORE BREAKING NEWS\nABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S HEALTH. INCLUDING SOMETHING HE JUST SAID\nIN CANTON OHIO. A NEW CLIP HAS JUST BEEN\nRELEASED FROM DR. OZ. TRUMP IS TALKING ABOUT HIS STAM\nNASMT LET ME PLAY THAT FIRST. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT STAMINA.\nYOU HAVE USED THAT WORD A LOT. YOU MADE AN ISSUE IN THE\nCAMPAIGN. YOU ARGUE THE PRESIDENT HAS TO\nHAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF STAMINA.\nIF ELECTED AT AGE 70 YOU WILL BE THE OLDEST PERSON TO EVER ENTER\nTHE OVAL OFFICE. WHY DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE THE\nSTAMINA FOR THE JOB? >> JUST ABOUT THE SAME AGE AS\nRONALD REAGAN. AND HILLARY IS A YEAR BEHIND ME.\nI WOULD JUST SAY BASED ON MY LIFE.\nI'VE HAD -- AND ACTUALLY AND I DON'T KNOW IF THIS MAKES SENSE.\nI FEEL AS GOOD TODAY AS I DID WHEN I WAS 30.\n>> SO BETSY HE JUST SAID THAT. >> I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT.\nBECAUSE 70 IS THE NEW 50. DEVELOPMENTS IN CARDIOVASCULAR\nMEDICINE AND FITNESS MEDICINE OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS CLEARLY\nCAN BE VERIFIED THAT A 70-YEAR-OLD MAN TODAY HAS SEVEN\nYEARS MORE LIFE EXPECTANCY THAN SOMEONE IN 1970 DID.\nIN OTHER WORDS WE HAVE GAINED SO MUCH NOT JUST IN LIFE EXPECTANCY\nBY THE WAY BUT ALSO IN QUALITY OF LIFE.\nSO THAT WHEN YOU COMPARE AGE 70 WITH PREVIOUS PRESIDENT,\nESPECIALLY FROM A CENTURY AGO. >> WHICH MAY BE FAIR.\nBY THE WAY IS ACTUALLY A DEFENSE OF BOTH OF THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE\nACTUALLY ONE YEAR APART. BUT DONALD TRUMP CAME OUT A\nMOMENT AGO IN CANDIDATEN OHIO. AND HE'S BEEN VERY QUIET ABOUT\nIN THIS WEEK. BUT HE'S SPECIFICALLY TALKING\nABOUT HER STAMINA. HERE SE.\n>> I DON'T KNOW FOLKS. DO YOU THINK HILLARY WOULD BE\nABLE TO STAND UP HERE FOR AN HOUR AND DO THIS?\nI DON'T KNOW. >> OBVIOUSLY HE'S TALKING TO HIS\nSUPPORTERS THERE. BUT IS THAT APPROPRIATE IN A\nWEEK WHERE HE'S TRIED TO BE QUIET ABOUT HER HEALTH TO\nBASICALLY SAY SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STRENGTH TO STAND.\n>> -- SHE'S IN OUR PRAYERS W E WANT HER THE DGET BETTER.\nWHAT HE'S REPEATEDLY DONE LONG BEFORE THE HEALTH CONSPIRACY\nTHEORIES AND WHAT NOT GOING BACK TO LAST YEAR, HE'S CONTRASTED\nHIS WORK ETHIC WITH HER WORK ETHIC.\nHE TOOK UEFA NEARLY 14 KAYS IN -- HE'S BEEN OUT ON THE TRAIL\nFAR MORE THAN SHE HAS. >> IF YOU LOOK AT HER LONG\nHISTORY AS SECRETARY OF STATE HE'S TRAVELED FAR MORE\nINTERNATIONALLY THAN ANY PREDECESSORS, INCLUDING\nPRESIDENTS. SHE'S BEEN OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN\nTRAIL. IT IS PRIVATE MEETINGS.\nINDIVIDUAL FUNDRAISERS. SHE'S NON STOP.\nHER WORK ETHIC SHOULD NEVER BE QUESTIONED AND SECONDARILY SHE\nREVEALED FAR MORE ON HER HEALTH RECORDS, CHOLESTEROL, BLOOD\nPRESSURE THAN JUST A PIECE OF PAPER HANDED OVER TO DR. OZ.\nRIGHT NOW WE'RE EXPECTED TO TAKE DONALD TRUMP'S WORD ABOUT HIS\nOWN STAMINA AND HOW HE FEELS -- >> -- ONLY ONE WAY WE'RE GOING\nTO KNOW AND THAT IS IF TOMORROW HE ACTUALLY RELEASED THAT PAPER\nAND WE SEE WHAT'S ON IT.

A LOT TO UNPACK THERE.\nHALF OF THE ELECTORATE SAID, I'M VOTING FOR COLIN POWELL.\nWHAT IS YOUR BIGGEST TAKE AWAY? TZ IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT\nCOLIN POWELL WOULD FEEL THE WAY HE DOES ABOUT DONALD TRUMP.\nBUT IT IS SURPRISING THAT THE AMOUNT OF VENOM, AMOUNT OF\nRESENTMENT HE HAS FOR THE CLINTONS.\nFRANKLY, COLIN POWELL IS SPEAKING FOR A BIG SWATH OF THE\nELECTORATE. HE WE SEE THIS IN POLE AFTER\nPOLE. 35%, 40% SAY, I DON'T LIKE THIS\nELECTION. CAN I HAVE A DO-OVER PLEASE.\nAND PEOPLE SAY ON THE ONE SIDE I HAVE A PERSON WITH A TRACK\nRECORD I FIND APORANT AND ON THE OTHER SIDE I FIND A PERSON\nAPORANT PERSONALLY. POWELL SPEAKS TO THAT\nFRUSTRATION. >> IS THAT WHY THIS BECAME SO\nBIG? POLLEN POWELL HAS A LONG HISTORY\nOF SERVING OUR COUNTRY. THE MAN IS 79 YEARS OLD.\nBUT BRUTAL HONESTY IN THE E-MAILS AND THE FACT HE TAPS\nINTO THE NARRATIVE YOU HEAR SO OFTEN PERHAPS IN LESS COLORFUL\nTERMS ABOUT THESE TWO CANDIDATES FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE DISSATISFIED\nWITH THE CHOICES THIS ELECTION. >> I AM AMAZED.\nCOLIN POWELL, A GREAT STATESMAN PB DRAGGED INTO THIS AND WHEN\nHIS PRIVATE E-MAILS WERE HACKED AND LEADING \"THE KELLY FILE,\"\nTHAT'S A BIG DEAL. AND I THINK THAT BOTH THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN AND CLINTON CAMPAIGN ARE VERY SMART, I WOULDN'T\nCOMMENT EITHER. I WOULD ABSOLUTELY TRY TO LET IT\nGO. I MIGHT EVEN SEND HIM A NOTE\nSAYING, WE'RE SORRY THAT THAT HAPPENED TO YOU.\nAND LEAVE IT AT THAT. >> IT HELPS POWELL THOUGH.\n>> HOW DOES IT HELP POWELL? >> POWELL DOESN'T NEED HELP.\n>> IT HELPS POWELL IN T",

I HAVE IT RIGHT HERE.\nSHOULD I DO IT? I DON'T CARE.\nIT'S TWO LETTERS.

HOW HE IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE\nMANY PLANS HE RUPPROPOSED. >> THANKS FOR THAT REPORTING.\nLET'S DISCUSS EVERYTHING WE LEARNED WITH MARK PRESTON,\n\"WASHINGTON POST\" POLITICAL REPORTER AND DR. SANJAY GUPTA.\nGREAT TO HAVE ALL OF YOU HERE. THERE IS POLITICS AND HEALTH.\nLET ME START WITH YOU, SANJAY, ABOUT HER HEALTH.\nTWO-PAGE LETTER THAT HILLARY CLINTON'S DOCTOR RELEASED.\nFILLED WITH LAB RESULTS AND THE VITAMINS SHE'S ON AND WHAT SHE'S\nNOT DEFICIENT IN. WHAT DID YOU SEE IN READING THIS\nLETTER? >> FIRST OF ALL, IT'S A LETTER.\nIT'S NOT MEDICAL RECORDS. ALL THIS TALK WHETHER MEDICAL\nRECORDS ARE GOING TO BE RELEASED.\nNEITHER ONE HAD MEDICAL RECORDS RELEASED.\nTHE BIGGER THING WAS A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT HAPPENED TO\nTHE RECENT HEALTH EPISODE. THE PNEUMONIA.\nSHE GOT A C.A.T. SCAN TO DIAGNOSE THAT AND PUT ON\nANTIBIOTICS. TEN DAYS OF AN ANTIBIOTIC KNOWN\nAS LEVIQUIN. THROUGHOUT THE YEAR SHE HAD\nSEVERAL SCANS. CT SCAN OF HER SINUSES AND BRAIN\nAND CT SCAN OF HER LUNGS. >> BECAUSE SHE HAS SEASONAL\nALLERGIES AND SISINUSITIS. SOMETIMES YOU'LL DO THAT AND THE\nBRAIN SHOWED NO ABNORMALITIES WHICH IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE GOING\nBACK TO 2012 THERE WAS ALL THESE QUESTIONS WAS THERE SOME SORT OF\nINJURY TO THE BRAIN. THE CT HAS REPORTED NO EVIDENCE\nOF ABNORMALITIES. >> YOU'RE SATISFIED WITH THIS\nLETTER? >> WE'RE READING A SUMMARY OF\nSOMEONE'S INTERPRETATION OF ALL THE MEDICAL RECORDS.\n>> WHAT DO WE USUALLY GET? WHAT ARE WE COMPARING THIS TO AS\nA STANDARD? >> THIS IS TYPICALLY WHAT WE\nGET. IN 2008 JOHN McCAIN RELEASED HIS\nMEDICAL RECORDS ABOUT 1,000 PAGES AND I GOT A CHANCE TO LOOK\nAT THOSE, BUT, TYPICALLY, IT'S A LETTER LIKE THIS AND SOME TYPE\nOF SUMMARY BY A PHYSICIAN WHO HAS BEEN TREATING THE PERSON FOR\nA LONG TIME. >> HOW IS THIS PLAYING\nPOLITICALLY IN TERMS OF WHO LOOKS KN IN THIS AND WHO\nDOESN'T? >> SORT OF HARD TO SAY.\nI LIKE TO LOOK AT THE POLL NUMBERS AND THERE REALLY ISN'T\nPOLLING ON THIS YET. HOW MUCH INFORMATION WE EXPECT\nFROM OUR CANDIDATES. ONE THING THAT WE'RE SEEING OR\nBEING REINFORCED HERE IS A PARTISAN INTERPRETATION TO THAT.\nPEOPLE WHO LIKE DONALD TRUMP THINK HE HAS GIVEN ENOUGH\nINFORMATION ON HIS TAXES AND ENOUGH INFORMATION IN GENERAL\nAND PEOPLE FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHE QUESTION THAT IS REALLY INTERESTING UNDERCUTTING ALL\nTHIS IS WHAT IS THE STANDARD? SHOULD WE GIVE THOUSANDS OF\nPAGES OR IS A LETTER OF A SUMMARY ENOUGH?\nWHETHER SUCH A LETTER IS ENOUGH, PARTICULARLY WHEN THERE IS AN\nACUTE INCIDENT THAT HAPPENS. BUT, I THINK THAT MOSTLY VOTERS\nARE GOING TO LOOK AT THIS THROUGH THE LENS AT WHICH THEY\nLOOK AT THE CANDIDATES, EITHER POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY.\n>> HILLARY HAS THIS DOCTOR WHO, BY ALL ACCOUNTS, IS A REAL\nDOCTOR. TRUMP GOES ON DR. OZ AND, ONCE\nAGAIN, USES HIS DR. BORSTEIN. HE IS CONTROVERSIAL BY ANY\nMEASURE AND HE WROTE A LETTER THAT WAS RIDICULOUS THE FIRST\nTIME PUTTING OUT HIS FINDINGS. SO, THEY DID IT IN DIFFERENT\nWAYS. DOES ANY OF THAT MATTER?\n>> HONESTLY, I DON'T REALLY THINK SO.\nIF YOU ASK SOMEONE WHO IS A FERVENT TRUMP SUPPORTER HOW THEY\nFEEL ABOUT THE LETTER, THEY WOULD DISAGREE WITH YOUR\nASSESSMENT. A LOT OF OPRAISES IN THERE.\n>> THAT ENDS THE ANALYSIS OF THE LETTER.\nDOCTORS DON'T WRITE HYPERBOLIC LETTERS THAT ARE FILLED WITH\nCRAZY ASSESSMENTS OF WHAT SOMEBODY'S SUPREME HEALTH IS.\n>> SURE. >> DOESN'T MATTER HOW YOU FEEL\nABOUT IT. THAT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT DR.\nSANJAY GUPTA DOES IN A REAL LETTER ABOUT ANYTHING.\nAM I WRONG ABOUT THIS? >> LACKED IN OBJECTIVE DATA, AS\nWELL. IT DIDN'T HAVE SOME SIMPLE\nOBJECTIVE DATA THAT YOU WOULD LOOK AT FOR SOMEONE'S RISK OF\nHEART DISEASE AND DIFFERENT THINGS.\n>> DR. TRUMP'S HEALTH AND IT WAS NOT A REAL DISCLOSURE OF HIS\nMEDICAL RECORDS. HE HAD IN HIS POCKET ONE-PAGE\nLETTER THAT HE REVEALED ON DR. OZ AND DR. OZ GOT TO TAKE A LOOK\nAT. SO, DOES THAT POLITICALLY ANSWER\nANY LINGERING QUESTIONS? >> NO.\nLOOK, PHILIP IS RIGHT. WHAT A MADE FOR TV MOMENT WHEN\nHE SITS DOWN AND TELLS DR. OZ, WE'RE NOT GOING TO DISCUSS\nSPECIFICS OR SPECIFICS ABOUT IT AND SITS DOWN AND PULLS OUT THE\nPIECE -- LOOK WHAT I HAVE IN MY HAND HERE.\n>> IT'S GOOD TV. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT POLITICS.\nTHE POLITICS OF IT, THOUGH, HE IS TRYING TO REACH A\nCONSTITUENCY THAT HE'S NOT DOING GREAT WITH NOW.\nTHAT IS WOMEN. HE'S DOING WELL WITH MARRIED\nWOMEN, BUT NOT DOING WELL WITH SINGLE WOMEN.\nSO, WHEN HE GOES ON DR. OZ, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A\nCONSTITUENCY OF VIEWERSHIP THAT IS LARGELY COMPRISED OF WOMEN.\nTHAT'S WHY HE DID THAT. AND, GUESS WHAT, WE'RE GOING TO\nBE TALKING ABOUT IT ALL DAY TODAY, AS WELL.\nTO HIS POINT, HE THINKS THAT HE IS NOT ONLY HITTING THAT\nCONSTITUENCY, BUT HITTING THE MAIN STREAM MEDIA.\nIT IS WORTH NOTING, THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME THAT WE'VE HAD A\nPOLITICIAN GO ON A PROGRAM THAT IS NOT MAIN STREAM MEDIA\nNECESSARILY, RIGHT? WE'VE SEEN THE OBAMAS DO IT ALL\nTHROUGH -- >> CLINTON JUST WENT ON KIMMEL\nYOU KNOW IN THIS FIRST BRUSH ABOUT HEALTH AND SHE WAS JOKING\nABOUT IT. >> THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT\nVENUES, BUT CLEARLY A STUNT. >> HERE IS A MOMENT FROM DR. OZ\nAND DONALD TRUMP'S EXCHANGE. WATCH THIS.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT STAMINA. YOU USE THAT WORD A LOT.\nYOU MADE IT AN ISSUE IN THIS CAMPAIGN.\nYOU ARGUE THAT A PRESIDENT HAS TO HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF\nSTAMINA. IF ELECTED AT AGE 70 YOU WILL BE\nTHE OLDEST PERSON TO EVER ENTER THE OVAL OFFICE.\nWHY DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE THE STAMINA FOR THE JOB?\n>> JUST ABOUT THE SAME AGE AS RONALD REAGAN AND HILLARY IS A\nYEAR BEHIND ME. JUST BASED ON MY LIFE, I\nACTUALLY, I DON'T KNOW IF THIS MAKES SENSE, I FEEL AS GOOD\nTODAY AS I DID WHEN I WAS 30. >> SANJAY, WHAT ELSE WAS\nREVEALED ON THE SHOW ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S HEALTH?\n>> FIRST, I WISH I FELT AS GOOD AS I DID WHEN I WAS 30.\nWE'RE GOING TO, OBVIOUSLY, SEE THE FULL SHOW WHEN HE HAS THE\nRESULTS RELEASED LATER TODAY. I TALKED TO DR. OZ YESTERDAY AND\nASKED ABOUT THIS. ONE THING HE ZEROED IN ON WAS\nHEART. DR. OZ IS A HEART SURGEON.\nHE HAD A CT OF HIS HEART LOOKING FOR CALCIUM.\nTHAT LOOKED GOOD. ALSO AN ECOCARDIOGRAM OF HIS\nHEART AND VARIOUS LAB TESTS. HOW DR. OZ SORT OF SUMMARIZED IT\nFOR ME IS HE SAID THOSE TESTS ALL LOOK GOOD FOR A MAN OF HIS\nAGE. >> HIS WEIGHT WAS A QUESTION.\n>> HIS WEIGHT IS A QUESTION BECAUSE WE'RE NOT EXACTLY SURE\nWHAT HIS WEIGHT IS I HEARD 236 AND I HEARD 267 AND AUDIENCE\nMEMBERS HEARD THAT AND HE IS 6'3\" IN HEIGHT.\n>> THAT WOULD BE OVERWEIGHT. IF IT WERE 267 AND HE'S 6'2\" OR\n6'3\", HE WOULD BE OOBESE. >> BMI OF ANYTHING OVER 30 IS\nCONSIDERED OBESE.

IT AIRS TOMORROW.\nIT IS AS IF IT WAS WRITTEN BY THE CAMPAIGN ITSELF.\nTHIS IS THE CLIP THEY RELEASED. >> I HAVE NO PROBLEM IN DOING\nIT. I HAVE IT RIGHT HERE.\nSHOULD I DO IT? I DON'T CARE.\nIT'S TWO LETTERS. ONE IS THE REPORT AND THE OTHER\nFROM LENOXVILLE HOSPITAL. >> CAN I SEE IT?\n>> SURE. >> THESE ARE THE TESTS THAT WERE\nDONE LAST WEEK. >> UNCLEAR WHY DR. OZ SEEMED\nSURPRISED. IT WAS ONLY IN THE HOURS JUST\nBEFORE TAPING THERE WAS ANY DOUBT.\nWHY? BECAUSE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN TOLD\nREPORTERS HE WOULD NOT RELEASE ANY INFORMATION, BUT THEN,\nSURPRISE, SO EITHER IT WAS A SHAM OR THEY WERE UNKNOWINGLY\nPEDDLING WRONG INFORMATION. WE CAN'T BE SURE WHAT IS IN THE\nLETTERS. CAMPAIGN SPOKESMAN SAID IT IS A\nONE-PAGE LETTER OF HIS PHYSICAL EXAM.\nWE ARE GETTING SOME DETAILS FROM DR. OZ ABOUT THE LETTERS.\nTHIS IS WHAT HE TOLD \"NBC NIGHTLY NEWS\" IN AN INTERVIEW\nTHAT JUST AIRED. >> I WAS SURPRISED.\nI LOOKED AT THEM AND TRIED TO PROCESS THEM QUICKLY.\nAS A DOCTOR, IF HE WAS MY PATIENT THEY ARE GOOD FOR A MAN\nHIS AGE. >> WHAT DID IT SAY.\n>> \u00e2\u0096\u00a0ITDETAILS A COLONOSCOPY AND A HEART SCAN THAT WAS GOOD.\nRESULTS FROM CHEST X-RAYS, EKGs AND LABORATORY RESULTS FROM LAST\nWEEK. >> THERE WILL BE BLOWBACK\nBECAUSE HE DID IT ON A TELEVISION SHOW.\nYOU ARE A DOCTOR ON TV. YOU ARE NOT HIS PERSONAL\nPHYSICIAN. YOU SAID IT WASN'T YOUR ROLE TO\nASK HIM TOUGH QUESTIONS. YOU ARE NOT A JOURNALIST.\nWHAT DO YOU SAY TO CRITICS. >> I'M A DOCTOR, I DIDN'T RUN\nTHE TESTS MYSELF BUT IT IS A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF A PERSON\nTHAT WOULD BE REVEALED FROM ONE DOCTOR TO ANOTHER.\n>> LET'S TAKE A MOMENT TO ABSORB THIS.\nTRUMP'S ANSWER TO CALLS FOR TRANSPARENCY IS TO GO TO DR. OZ\nSHOW AND GIVE A SUMMARY OF A PHYSICAL PERFORMED BY THE SAME\nDOCTOR THAT TRUMP WOULD BE THE HEALTHIEST PRESIDENT IN HISTORY.\nTHE ONLY ANNOUNCEMENT WE HAVE ON SAID HISTORY IS A DOCTOR THAT'S\nBEEN CALLED TO CONGRESS TO TESTIFY ABOUT HIS PROMOTION OF\nUNPROVEN WEIGHT LOSS PRODUCTS ON HIS SHOW.\nA LOT TO DISCUSS WITH THE PANEL. LET'S START OFF WITH THE FACT\nYOU JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH DR. OZ.\nHE TOLD YOU WHAT HE WAS SHOWN BY DONALD TRUMP.\n>> DR. OZ IS A CARDIO THORACIC SURGEON.\nWE DRILL DOWN ON THE HEART STUFF SPECIFICALLY.\nTHAT'S THE BIGGEST CONCERN FOR MOST PEOPLE IS HEART HEALTH.\nHE HAD A CORONARY CALCIUM SCAN. HE HAD EKGs AND AN ECHO\nCARDIOGRAM, DONALD TRUMP. PREFACE IT BY SAYING HE IS\nGETTING RESULTS FROM ANOTHER DOCTOR WHO IS INTERPRETING THE\nRESULTS WHO HAPPENS TO BE FRIENDS WITH DONALD TRUMP.\nYOU HAVE TO TAKE IT WITH THAT GRAIN OF SALT.\nBUT HE SAID LOOKING AT THE TEST RESULTS HE WAS NOT CONCERNED AND\nTHOUGHT THEY LOOKED FINE FOR SOMEONE OF HIS AGE.\nALSO HIS NUMBERS, CHOLESTEROL AND ALL OF THAT.\nHE IS ON A STATIN DRUG BUT IN SUMMARY THERE WASN'T A CONCERN\nTHAT DR. OZ SEEMED TO HAVE ABOUT TRUMP'S HEART.\n>> THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION THAT DR. OZ TOLD YOU WAS\nPROVIDED, COMPARE TO THE AMOUNT THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAD.\n>> GOOD POINT. NEITHER ARE ENOUGH PROBABLY BUT\nWITH SECRETARY CLINTON'S REPORT, YOU DID GET A MORE DETAILED\nACCOUNTING, NOT ONLY OF SOME SPECIFIC HEALTH RETURNS BUT THE\nCT SCAN OF THE HEART, BRAIN, LUNGS THE MEDICATION SHE'S BEEN\nON AND SHE IS ON A BLOOD THINNER LOOKING AT HOW THEY ARE\nESTABLISHING WHAT BLOOD THINNER SHE SHOULD BE ON AND WHAT THE\nTEST RESULTS ARE HAVE BEEN. YOU DID GET A COMPLETE PICTURE.\nWE WILL SEE IF THERE IS MORE ON THE SHOW TOMORROW.\nRIGHT NOW THERE IS MORE INFORMATION ABOUT SECRETARY\nCLINTON THAN MR. TRUMP. >> THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN COULD\nRELEASE MORE INFORMATION, THEY SAID THEY MIGHT DO THAT.\nBUT ABOUT THIS DR. OZ SPECTACLE. AGAIN, FOR PEOPLE WATCHING ALL\nDAY IT WASN'T JUST THAT HE WENT ON.\nIT WAS WE HEARD FROM PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE AND ONLY PEOPLE IN\nTHIS AUDIENCE WE ARE TOLD, DONALD TRUMP'S WEIGHT AND WHAT\nDRUGS. >> HE WANTED TO LOSE WEIGHT\nAPPARENTLY. >> IT IS UNUSUAL.\n>> I WOULD SAY. >> THE QUESTION IS UNUSUAL OR\nUNACCEPTABLE? >> WE HAVE LIVED THERE I THIS\nCAMPAIGN WHERE THE UNACCEPTABLE HAS BECOME ACCEPTABLE.\nTHIS CAMPAIGN IS DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING ANY OF US HAVE EVER\nSEEN. THIS IS VERY TRUMPIAN TO DO\nTHIS. DONALD TRUMP WAS THE HOST OF THE\nREALITY TV SHOW. GOING ON A REALITY TV SHOW AND\nREACHING A WIDE AUDIENCE HE WANTED TO REACH, WOMEN VIEWERS\nIN PARTICULAR, IF YOU WANT TO CUT DOWN THE DEMOGRAPHIC OF THE\nAUDIENCE IS NOT A DUMB THING FOR DONALD TRUMP TO DO IF HE WANTS\nTO TALK TO WOMEN AND SAY, OKAY, I JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE MY HEALTH\nNUMBERS HERE. WHY DON'T YOU LOOK AT THEM,\nDR. OZ AND TELL US WHAT YOU THINK.\nI THINK FROM MY PERSPECTIVE OF A POLITICAL JOURNALIST THAT'S BEEN\nAROUND THIS IS THE STRANGEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN, BUT IN\nTHIS CAMPAIGN AND WITH THIS CANDIDATE, SOMEHOW IT SEEMS TO\nBE PART OF HIS MOW SAMOSAIC. >> WRITING NEW STORIES THAT ARE\n2500 WORDS LONG, IN DEPTH STORIES, TALKING TO THE C\nCANDIDATE AND HIS DOCTOR. DONALD TRUMP, THE CLASSIC\nSHOWMAN,ER REALITY INTERTV ENTERTAINER.\nALL ABOUT CROWD WORK AND KNOWING HIS AUDIENCE ABOUT HOW TO SPIN\nIT. HE GOES ON DR. OZ AND DOES THIS\nTHING, SHOULD I SHOW IT?

WE DIDN'T FIND OUT UNTIL SUNDAY\nWHEN YOU SAW THAT VIDEO YOU JUST PLAYED THAT SE HAD BEEN\nDIAGNOSED ON FRIDAY AND SHE'D SPENT THE WEEK PRIOR BEING MORE\nACCESSIBLE TO REPORTERS WITH THIS SORT OF TRYING TO CREATE\nMORE OF AN AIR OF TRANSPARENCY. SO SHE REALLY UNDERCUT HERSELF.\nSO HER CAMPAIGN TRYING TO MAKE SOME AEMDS THERE.\nPUTTING OUT SOME INFORMATION PEOPLE WERE DEMANDING.\nA COUPLE THINGS WE LEARNED THAT WERE INTERESTING, ONE WAS THAT\nSHE HAD HAD SYMPTOMS A WEEK PRIOR TO HER PNEUMONIA\nDIAGNOSIS. SO A FULL NINE DAYS BEFORE WE\nFOUND OUT. THAT SHE WAS AND THEN WE ALSO\nLEARNED THAT BACK IN JANUARY SHE HAD HAD SINUSITIS AND AN EAR\nINFECTION THAT GOT BAD ENOUGH WITH FLUID IN HER EAR THAT SHE\nHAD TO HAVE A TUBE INSERTED INTO HER LEFT EAR.\nTHAT IS LEAD UP TO THE IOWA CAUCUSES FULL STEAM AHEAD ON THE\nCAMPAIGN TRAIL AND SHE WENT THROUGH THAT.\nALL OF THIS INFORMATION COMING OUT BRINGS HER TO THE STANDARD\nOF MITT ROMNEY AND BARACK OBAMA IN 2012.\nNOT CERTAINLY TO THE STANDARD OF JOHN McCAIN WHERE REH EHNEHE RE\nPAGES OF MEDICAL RECORDS. BUT SHE HAS A LOT MORE OUT THERE\nTHAN DONALD TRUMP AND WE'VE KNOWN A LOT MORE ABOUT HER\nMEDICAL HISTORY OVER THE LAST YEAR THAN DONALD TRUMP.\nA DEEP VAIN THROMBOSIS. AND THE 2012 CONCUSSION SHE\nSUFFERED AFTER FAINTING THAT LED TO THE BLOOD CLOT BETWEEN HER\nSKULL AND BRAIN. >> DR. SANJAY GUPTA JOINS US\nNOW. AN EVALUATION OF WHAT YOU\nLEARNED. >> WE GOT A MUCH BETTER\nEXPLANATION AS BRIANNA SAID ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED OVER THE\nPAST FEW DAYS. THIS PNEUMONIA THAT WAS\nDIAGNOSED BY A CAT SCAN AS WELL. THIS YEAR IT IS INTERESTING\nSHE'S HAD A SCAN OF HER BRAIN, HER LUNGS AND OF HER HEART AS\nWELL. SHE HAS A HISTORY OF HEART\nDISEASE IN HER FAMILY. AND ALL THOSE LOOKED GOOD.\nKNOWING THAT HER BRAIN SCAN NOW LOOKS GOOD WAS AN IMPORTANT\nPOINT AFTER THE CONCUSSION. THIS IS NOT A FULL RELEASE OF\nMEDICAL RECORDS BY BIANY MEANS BUT AS BRIANNA SAID THIS IS MORE\nTHAN WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST AND CERTAINLY MORE THAN WE'VE SEEN\nFROM MR. TRUMP. >> AND ON THAT NOTE, TONIGHT WE\nARE LEARNING SOME NEW INFORMATION ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S\nHEALTH. BECAUSE HE GAVE THE RESULTS OF\nHIS RECENT PHYSICAL TO TV'S DR. OZ DURING A TAPED INTERVIEW.\nDR. OZ TELLING NBC NEWS HE WAS ACTUALLY CAUGHT OFF GUARD BY\nWHAT TRUMP REVEALED. HE DIDN'T EXPECT DONALD TRUMP TO\nHAND HIM THAT SHEET OF PAPER WITH THE DETAILS.\nHERE IS HOW HE PUT IT. >> I WAS, YOU KNOW, SURPRISED.\nI LOOKED AT THEM AND TRY TO PROCESS IT PRETTY QUICKLY.\nAND IF I WAS A DOCTOR, IF HE WAS MY PATIENT ARE THEY ARE GOOD FOR\nA MAN OF HIS AGE. >> WHAT DID IT SAID.\n>> DETAILS FROM A COLONOSCOPY HE HAD A FEW YEARS AGO.\nA CALCIUM SCAN OF HIS HEART THAT WAS DONE THAT LOOKED GOOD.\nHE HAD RESULTS FROM CHEST X-RAIES AND EKGS AND THE LABOTT\nRESULTS FROM LAST WEEK. >> TYPICALLY NOT THE WAY WE SEE\nCANDIDATES RELEASE THAT KIND OF INFORMATION AND THE DRAMA REALLY\nHEIGHTENED THIS MORNING BECAUSE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN SAYING NO\nTRUMP IS NOT GOING TO RELEASE THE RESULTS OF HIS PHYSICAL\nTODAY ON THE DR. OZ SHOW AND HEENEDED UP DOING JUST THAT,\nPULLING IT OUT OF HIS POCKET AND GIVING IT TO DR. OZ.\nTHIS IS JUST A ONE-PAGE SUMMARY OF THE PHYSICAL THAT HE HAD LAST\nWEEK. AND IT HAS NOT YET BEEN PUBLICLY\nRELEASED. THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN SAYS THEY\nWILL GET TO THAT TOMORROW. THEY LIKELY WILL RELEASE THAT\nTOMORROW. BUT CNN WAS OUTSIDE OF THE SHOW.\nWE TALKED TO MANY AUDIENCE MEMBERS WHO WERE INSIDE FOR THE\nTAPING AND -- SMALL PICTURE OF WHAT DONALD TRUMP'S HEALTH\nREALLY LOOKS LIKE. -- AUDIENCE MEMBER WHO SAYS SHE\nWEIGHS 236 POUNDS. HE SAYS HE DOES NOT EXERCISE AND\nTHAT HE WOULD LIKE TO LOSE BETWEEN 15 AND 20 POUNDS AND HE\nIS ON STATINS, DRUGS THAT HELP LOWER CHOLESTEROL LEVELS.\nTOMORROW WHEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS ANTICIPATED TO RELEASE THIS\nMEDICAL SUMMARY FROM HIS POSITION, IT SHOULD BE NOTED\nTHAT THIS STILL IS NOT ONE THE RESULT OF WHAT THAT PHYSICAL WAS\nLIKE BUT TWO NOT A FULL DISCLOSURE OF HIS MEDICAL\nHISTORY AND DOCUMENTS THAT WOULD BE MORE IN LINE WITH PREVIOUS\nPRESIDENTIAL NOMINEES. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nAND OUT FRONT NOW, PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FORMER DOCTOR.\nAND -- MAGGIE, JUST IN TERMS OF STYLE\nTODAY. YOU GET THE LETTER AND THE LIST\nOF THINGS FROM HILLARY CLINTON TODAY.\nDONALD TRUMP GOING OUT ON DR. OZ, AND I'VE GOT IT.\nHERE IT IS. AND NOW EVEN NOW WE'RE NOT\nGETTING THE FORMAL RESULTS PUBLICLY TILL TOMORROW.\n>> WHAT HAVE WE GOT? WE KNOW WHAT HE WEIGHS.\nTHAT IS THE NEW THING WE LEARNED.\nWE KNEW HE WAS ON STATIN BEFORE, A FORM OF, FROM THE VERY UNUSUAL\nLETTER HIS DOCTOR WROTE A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO.\nWE ALSO KNOW FROM THAT NOTE THAT THE DOCTOR SAID IN THAT LETTER\nTHAT TRUMP HAD LOST 15 POUNDS OVER THE PREVIOUS YEAR.\nI DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS TRUMP WEIGHED BEFORE.\nI DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS NOW.\nHE DID THIS WITH HIS USUAL STYLE.\nHE WASN'T GOING TO RELIES T. HE IS GOING TO RELIES IT.\nTHAT OBSCURES THE FACT THIS IS STILL A PRETTY LOW LEVEL OF\nDISCLOSURE FOR A PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE.\nAND I DON'T KNOW HOICH MORE WE'RE GOING SEE WHEN THEY MAKE\nTHE RELEASE LATER THIS WEEK. >> AND SANJAY, IN TERMS OF WHAT\nWE'RE GOING TO GET, ONE COULD PRESUME THE THINGS THAT WERE\nDISCUSSED IN THIS INTERVIEW WITH DR. OZ, CHOLESTEROL, STATINS,\nBLOOD PRESSURE, BUT WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE WHAT ELSE.\n>> AND I TALKED TO DR. OZ A LITTLE TODAY AS WELL.\nAND YOU HEARD HIM TALK ABOUT. HE'S A CARDIO THORACIC SURGEON\nSO CERTAINLY SOMETHING HE WAS LOOKING FOR WAS A HEART.\nAND EKGS AND THE CONNECTICUT -- CT SCAN OF THE HEART.\nTHOSE COULD BE IMPORTANT TESTS TO RELAY ANY CONCERNS ABOUT\nHEART DISEASE. >> WHEN HE ADMITS HE DOESN'T\nEXERCISE AND HE'S OVERWEIGHT. >> AND A STATIN DRUG.\nAND THAT IS WHAT YOU WOULD REALLY WANT TO ZERO O IN ON.\n>> AND DOCTOR, FIRST OF ALL, YOU ARE SUPPORTING HILLARY CLINTON.\nBUT YOU HAVE TOLD ME ON THE SHOW THAT YOU WANTED A FULL\nNEUROLOGICAL EXAM. YOU WANTED THOSE RESULTS.\nOBVIOUSLY WE'RE NOT GETTING A FULL MEDICAL HISTORY HERE IN\nEITHER CASE. WE CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE THAT ON\nTHE NEURALLOGICAL SIDE. ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH WHAT YOU\nNOW HAVE. >> I WAS VERY IMPRESSED SHE GOT\nA CT SCAN. BY THAT ALONE I'M VERY IMPRESSED\nWITH HER DOCTOR. BUT I THINK BOTH KLDS SHOULD\nHAVE WHAT WE CALL NEUROPSYCHOLOGIC TESTING.\n-- BOTH CANDIDATES. I THINK SHE NEEDS\nNEUROPSYCHOLOGIC TESTING JUST TO SEE THERE'S NO NEUROLOGIC\nSEQUELAE FROM HER INJURY. AND TRUMP I THINK NEEDS A\nNEUROPSYCHOLOGIC BECAUSE OF HIS ERRATIC BEHAVIOR.\nIF SOMEBODY CAME INTO MY OFFICE WITH THAT KIND OF -- THE KIND OF\nTHINGS THAT HE DOES, I WOULD REALLY BE WONDERING ABOUT THE\nPERSONALITY. I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S -- WE KNOW\nHE'S GOT A NARCISSISTIC PERSONALITY DISORDER AT THE VERY\nLEAST. BUT I SOMETIMES WONDER IF HE\nWOULD EVEN BE HYPOMANIC. BUT I THINK PSYCHOLOGIC TESTING\nWOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR HIM. IS SOMETHING I THINK MAYBE\nSHOULD BE FOR ALL CANDIDATES. >> WHEN YOU SAY ALL CANDIDATES\nAND OBVIOUSLY THERE IS SOME SPECULATION IF WHAT THE DOCTOR\nWAS SAYING THERE. GOING THIS IS GOING TO BE THE\nFINAL POINT OF THIS. WE'RE NOT GOING GET A DEEP\nMEDICAL HISTORY FROM EITHER ONE. >> OF COURSE NOT.\nTHERE IS NO LAW THAT REQUIRES ANY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE NEEDS\nTO PUT ANY RECORDS OUT QUITE FRANKLY.\nAS FAR AS ANY KIND OF MENTAL TESTING.\nLAST TIME I THINK WE EVEN SAW THAT WAS BACK IN McGOVERN IN\n'72. AND [INDISCERNIBLE]\n. WHAT WE SAW TODAY WAS A MADE FOR\nTV MOMENT THAT DONALD TRUMP CREATED AND HE DID IT ON A SHOW\nTO TRY TO REACH A CERTAIN VOTER, WHICH WAS WOMEN.\nAND AS MAGGIE SAID, IT WAS A GAME FOR DONALD TRUMP.\n>> BUT THAT IS THE AUDIENCE HE NEEDS TO REACH.\nAND THAT IS THE AUDIENCE OF THAT SHOW.\n>> IT IS THE AUDIENCE HE NEEDS TO REACH IT'S INTERESTING\nBECAUSE WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS A SUMMARY THAT SOMEONE ELSE HAS\nPUT TOGETHER, USUALLY WITH INPUT FROM THE CAMPAIGN OF THE MEDICAL\nRECORDS BY SOMEONE WHO MAY ALSO BE A FRIEND OR AT LEAST HAVE A\nCOLLEGIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CANDIDATE.\nYOU HAVE TO TAKE ALL THAT INTO ACCOUNT.\nPART OF THE REASON YOU ASK FOR THE MEDICAL RECORDS.\nSO YOU CAN GET DISPASSIONATE REVIEW.\nBUT THE POINT IS WE DON'T KNOW EVEN WHAT WE DON'T KNOW.\nNOT TO SUGGEST THERE IS SOMETHING THERE.\nWE DON'T KNOW. THAT IS SORT OF THE POINT.\nI DON'T KNOW THAT WE SHOULD BE MAKING DIAGNOSES, EVEN\nPSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSES FROM ITHE. IT WAS INTERESTING AT THE END OF\nSECRETARY CLINTON'S NOTE THE DOCTOR WROTE \"I BELIEVE HER\nMENTAL HEALTH IS GOOD\". >> SHE'S NOT A PSYCHIATRIST.\n>> RIGHT. >> IN BOTH CASES THEY ARE\nGETTING LETTERS FROM DOCTORS WHO HAVE KNOWN THEM AND WORKED WITH\nTHEM FOR MANY, MANY YEARS.

OZ.\nSO WHAT DID THE PAPERWORK SHOW? LET'S BEGIN WITH NATIONAL\nPOLITICAL REPORTER MJ LEE IN NEW YORK.\nYOU TALKED TO FOLKS IN THE AUDIENCE.\nWHAT DID TRUMP TELL THEM TODAY? >> BROOKE, REMEMBER, THIS IS THE\nCANDIDATE WHOSE DOCTOR CLAIMS WOULD BE THE HEALTHIEST PERSON\nEVER ELECTED PRESIDENT. IT SOUNDS LIKE DR. OZ'S TAKE\nAWAY TODAY WAS, INDEED, THAT TRUMP IS IN VERY GOOD HEALTH.\nLET'S LISTEN TO THINGS AUDIENCE MEMBERS TOLD US AFTER THE\nTAPING. >> MOST OF THE TIME HE DIDN'T\nREALLY ANSWER THE QUESTIONS DIRECTLY SO IT WAS PROBABLY\nFLATTERING FOR HIM AL OWE I DON'T THINK IF YORE PAYING\nATTENTION HE ANSWERED ANYTHING. >> DID HE SHARE DETAILS FROM THE\nPHYSICAL? >> YEAH, DR. OZ READ THAT OUT\nLOUD. >> WHAT INFORMATION WAS IN THE\nLETTER. >> THAT SHE WAS IN GREAT SHAPE.\n>> ACCORDING TO DR. OZ EVERYTHING SEEMED NORMAL.\n>> THAT'S A QUOTE HE USED? >> YEAH, NO SURPRISES EXCEPT,\nAGAIN, THAT DONALD TRUMP SAYS HE'S ON A STAT STIN,\nCHOLESTEROL-LOWERING DRUG AND THAT'S BASICALLY IT.\n>> THE STATIN, OF COURSE, IS A DRUG YOU TAKE TO MANAGE YOUR\nCHOLESTEROL LEVEL, TRUMP SEEMED TO SAY HIS CHOLESTEROL LEVEL\nUSED TO BE HIGH BUT CONFIRMED THAT AS OF RIGHT NOW IT'S ON A\nVERY GOOD LEVEL. ON OTHER INTERESTING INFORMATION\nTHAT WE GOT FROM THE AUDIENCE MEMBERS, AND I WANT TO STRESS\nAGAIN THAT THIS IS AUDIENCE MEMBERS COMING OUT OF THE TAPING\nPARAPHRASING WHAT THEY THOUGHT THEY HEARD, TRUMP WOULD LIKE TO\nLOSE SOME WEIGHT, AT LEAST 15 POUNDS.\nMULTIPLE AUDIENCE MEMBERS TOLD US TRUMP DOES NOT EXERCISE BUT\nHE WANTS TO PLAY MORE GOLF AND ONE AUDIENCE MEMBER SAID HE SAID\nHE'S GOOD ENOUGH AT GOLF TO PLAY IN THE PGA.\nONE TOPIC, BROOKE, THAT DIDN'T COME IS UP HILLARY CLINTON.\nMULTIPLE AUDIENCE MEMBERS TELLING US TRUMP SIMPLY WISHED\nHER WELL BUT DIDN'T DEVIL INTO POLITICS, OF COURSE, HILLARY\nCLINTON HAS BEEN RESTING AT HOME IN CHAPPAQUA, NEW YORK, TAKING A\nCOUPLE DAYS OFF THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL EVER SINCE IT WAS REVEALED\nOVER THE WEEKEND SHE HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA.\nBOTH CANDIDATES FEELING A LOT OF PRESSURE TO SHARE MORE\nINFORMATION ABOUT THEIR MEDICAL HISTORIES AND RECORDS.\nBROOKE? >> IT'S ABOUT TRANSPARENCY, THEY\nWANT TO BE THE LEADERS OF THE FREE WORLD.\nMJ LEE, THANK YOU SO MUCH. MJ TALKED TO MEMBERS OF THE\nAUDIENCE, WE DID AS WELL. I TALKED TO KELLY PLAT LAST\nHOUR, A PHARMACY INTERN SITTING IN THE AUDIENCE IN THE STUDIO,\nSHE TOLD ME SHE LEARNED TRUMP TRIES TO EAT HEALTHY FOODS.\nHERE'S KELLY. >> HE IS THE EPITOME OF HEALTH,\nI BELIEVE HIM ON, THAT YOU CAN SEE IT.\nHE LOOKS IT. YOU CAN SEE HE'S A VERY HEALTHY\nMAN AND DR. OZ AGREED OF DR. OZ READ THE LETTERS FROM HIS\nPHYSICIAN. HE DOES NOT EXERCISE BUT GOING\nTO THESE FUNCTIONS WHERE HE'S METING WITH 35,000 PEOPLE,\n45,000 PEOPLE AND YOU'RE SITTING THERE WALKING EVERYWHERE, THAT'S\nEXERCISE.

OZ THIS MORNING, WHAT DID HE SHARE?\n>> HE TOLD ME THAT -- IT WAS INTERESTING, HE SAID THEY\nWEREN'T SURE WHEN THE SHOW STARTED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO\nGET ANY OF TRUMP'S MEDICAL RECORDS.\n>> AS EARLY AS THIS MORNING. >> SO HE DID WHAT'S CALLED A\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS WHICH BASICALLY MEANS I ASK YOU\nQUESTIONS, HAVE YOU HAD PROBLEMS WITH X, Y, Z, GETTING A MEDICAL\nHISTORY. HE PUSHED TRUMP FOR MORE\nTRANSPARENCY AND AT THAT POINT IS WHEN THIS ONE-PAGE LETTER WAS\nREVEALED, THE PAGE LETTER THAT YOU JUST HEARD DESCRIBED BY\nTHOSE GUESTS, GAVE NUMBERS ABOUT CHOLESTEROL AND BLOOD PRESSURE\nAND THINGS LIKE THAT. THAT'S THE WAY IT WENT DOWN.\nSO IT WASN'T AN EXAMPLE OF ANY SORT THERE AND IT SOUNDS LIKE IT\nWAS CURSORY IN TERMS OF WHAT WAS PROVIDED BY BUT EVEN UP UNTIL IT\nSOUNDS LIKE THIS MORNING WHEN THIS WAS ALL BEING PLANNED THEY\nWEREN'T SURE WHAT IF ANY MEDICAL RECORDS WOULD BE RELEASED.\n>> BUT THIS ONE PAGE, THIS WAS BASED UPON THE PHYSICAL FROM\nLAST WEEK, CORRECT? >> THAT'S RIGHT.\n>> SO BASED UPON WHAT WE'VE SEEN AND ALSO JUST HEARING HE SAYS HE\nWANTS TO LOSE 15 TO 20 POUNDS, HE USED TO HAVE HIGH\nCHOLESTEROL, TOOK MEDS TO HELP WITH THAT, YOUR OVERALL\nASSESSMENT? >> YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND OF HARD\nTO MAKE AN OVERALL ASSESSMENT. THERE'S NOTHING THAT'S A RED\nFLAG BUT THIS IS ALL SO STRANGE. YOU'RE JUST --\n>> IT'S OKAY, WE TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THAT OUT LOUD.\nIT'S STRANGE. >> TO SOMEHOW MAKE THIS MORE\nTHAN WHAT IT IS IS HARD TO DO. YOU'RE SEEING EXACTLY WHAT\nSOMEONE WANTS YOU TO SEE IN A FORGNAT IS HIGHLY UNUSUAL AND,\nYOU KNOW, THERE'S NO PATIENT/PHYSICIAN RELATIONSHIP\nHERE WHATSOEVER SO I JUST DON'T THINK YOU CAN MAKE ANYTHING OF\nIT GOOD OR BAD.

THE CROWD WAS EXCITED TO SEE HIM\nTHERE. IT WAS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME\nOPPORTUNITY TO BE THERE TO HEAR HIS SPEECH, TO HEAR HIS -- I\nWOULD SAY HIS PLANS FOR EVERYBODY, PLANS FOR THINGS THAT\nHE WANTS TO IMPLEMENT IN THE UNITED STATES.\n>> OKAY, LET'S JUST STAY ON HIS HEALTH, IF WE CAN, KELLY, AND I\nUNDERSTAND HE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IN THE PAST HAVING\nHIGHER CHOLESTEROL AND THAT HE WANTS TO LOSE A LITTLE BIT OF\nWEIGHT. WHAT DO YOU RECALL FROM THAT\nPIECE OF THE CONVERSATION? >> WELL, I KNOW HE STATED THAT\nHE GAVE LETTERS FROM HIS DOCTORS THAT HE IS THE EPITOME OF HEALTH\nAND I BELIEVE HIM ON THAT, YOU CAN SEE IT.\nHE LOOKS IT. YOU CAN SEE HE'S A VERY HEALTHY\nMAN AND DR. OZ AGREED WITH HIM AFTER DR. OZ EVEN READ THE\nLETTERS FROM HIS PHYSICIAN AND EVERYBODY CAN HAVE THE\nOPPORTUNITY TO LOSE A LITTLE WEIGHT, JUST BE HEALTHIER AND\nLOWER YOUR CHOLESTEROL AND THAT'S ONE THING DONALD TRUMP\nMENTIONED WAS THAT HIS CHOLESTEROL WAS HIGH AT ONE TIME\nAND HE WAS PUT ON STATINS TO LOWER HIS CHOLESTEROL AND HE HAS\nZERO HEALTH ISSUES, HE HAS NO HEART PROBLEMS AND NO OTHER\nHEALTH ISSUES WHICH WILL BE HARMING HIM FOR HIS PRESIDENTIAL\nRUN. >> DID HE TALK, KELLY, AT ALL --\nYOU TALK HOW HE'S THE EPITOME OF HEALTH.\nDID HE TALK ABOUT WHAT HE EATS. I KNOW HE HAS A PENCHANT FOR\nFAST FOOD ON THE TRAIL. >> SORRY, CAN YOU REPEAT THAT?\n>> CANDID HE TALK ABOUT WHAT HE EATS?\n>> HE EATS VERY HEALTHY FROM WHAT HE SAID.\nOCCASIONALLY HE MIGHT WANT TO GO FOR A QUICK HAMBURGER.\nBUT THAT ICE -- WHOEVER HAS TO GO FOR A QUICK HAMBURGER IF\nTHEY'RE HUNGRY IF THEY GO TO A FAST FOOD PLACE.\nAS LONG AS YOU DON'T GO FREQUENTLY, EVERYBODY CAN BE ON\nA HEALTHY FOOD PLAN. >> I KNOW HE'S A BUSY MAN, I\nCAN'T IMAGINE THE ZIGZAGGING AHEAD OF NOVEMBER 8 BUT DOES HE\nEXERCISE? DID HE TALK ABOUT THAT AT ALL?\n>> HE SAID HE DOES NOT EXERCISE BUT JUST GOING TO ALL THESE\nFUNCTIONS WHERE HE'S MEETING WITH 35,000 PEOPLE, 45,000\nPEOPLE AND YOU'RE SITTING WALKING THROUGH EVERYONE, TO ME\nTHAT IS EXERCISE SO YOU MAY NOT BE GOING TO THE GYM AND LIFTING\nWEIGHTS BUT GOING TO ALL THESE POLITICAL FUNCTIONS WHERE HE'S\nCONSTANTLY WALKING, WALKING IS VERY GOOD AND WALKING IS A PART\nOF THE EXERCISE REGIMEN. >> DID HE SAY ANYTHING THAT\nSURPRISED YOU OR DID YOU HAVE A FAVORITE MOMENT?\n>> I KNOW HE LIKES TO PLAY GOLF BUT HE HASN'T HAD TIME TO PLAY A\nLOT OF GOLF, BEING ON THE PRESIDENTIAL RUN AND THE\nCAMPAIGN TRAIL, THERE'S NOT A LOT OF TIME FOR EXTRA CURRICULAR\nACTIVITIES WHERE HE CAN GO PLAY GOLF BUT I KNOW HE CAN PLAY GOLF\nWITH THE PGA PLAYERS AND I BELIEVE HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH\nON THAT. >> HE SAID -- HE REMARKED HE'S\nSO GOOD AT GOLF HE COULD DO THE PGA TOUR.\nKELLY PLAT, YOU HAD QUITE THE EXPERIENCE TODAY.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING IT, FAST FOOD AND DR.

JOINING ME, A DOCTOR WHO IS AN\nASSISTANT PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SCHOOL OF\nMEDICINE, MARK PRESTON IS OUR CNN POLITICAL EDITOR AND WITH\nDREW GRIFFIN, CNN INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT SO HELLO TO ALL OF\nYOU. FIRST TO YOU AS THE DOCTOR, AS\nTHE M.D. ON THE SET, MY QUESTION IS, LISTENING TO KELLY AND\nHEARING SPECIFICALLY TRUMP SAID HE WANTED TO LOSE 15 TO 20\nPOUNDS, SHE SAID EPITOME OF HEALTH.\nTOTAL TRANSPARENCY, YOU'VE NEVER EXAMINED MR. TRUMP.\n>> SURE. >> QUICK ASSESS.\n>> IN GENERAL, FOR SOMEBODY WHO'S THAT AGE WHO HAD HIGH\nCHOLESTEROL IN THE PAST WHO LIKES FAST FOOD YOU'D SCREEN FOR\nHEART DISEASE TO MAKE SURE THAT CARDIO\nCARDIOVASCULARLY, THAT PERSON IS OKAY.\n>> SHE SAYS HE SPEAKS TO 45,000 PERSON CROWD AND THAT'S\nEXERCISE. YOUR ASSESSMENT?\n>> WALKING A LOT IS. WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT PEOPLE\nHAVING A SEDENTARY LIFE-STYLE BUT THERE'S NO STANDARD HISTORY\nIN PHYSICAL EXAM. THERE'S THREE DIFFERENT WAYS\nDOCTORS APPROACH IT. FIRST THEY LOOK AT THE SYMPTOMS\nPEOPLE ARE REPORTING SO FOR HIM THE FOCUS WOULD BE A LITTLE MORE\nON HIS CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH. THEN PEOPLE DO GENERAL SCREENING\nTESTS SO FOR EXAMPLE WHAT KIND OF TESTS WOULD YOU DO WITH THAT\nPERSON AND THEN THERE'S A THIRD TYPE OF TEST WHERE YOU HAVE A\nPRE-OP TEST, CAN YOU STAND THE STRESS OF PRESIDENCY AND DO MORE\nINTENSIVE TESTS BASED ON THAT. >> SO WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE\nWAS TOLD TO HOP ON A TREADMILL, BLOOD TESTS THAT KIND OF THING,\nWE DON'T HAVE THAT.

TWO DAYS LATER, AUGUST 26th, NBC\nNEWS SCORED AN INTERVIEW WITH THAT DOCTOR WHO HAD RELEASED A\nLETTER. IN THAT INTERVIEW, DONALD\nTRUMP'S GASTROINTEROLOGIST SAID THAT HE WROTE THAT LETTER IN\nABOUT FIVE MINUTES WHILE A DONALD TRUMP STAFFER STOOD\nOUTSIDE AND WAITED FOR IT. HE SAID SOME OF THE MORE OVER\nTHE TOP STATEMENTS IN THAT LETTER, THE ASTONISHINGLY\nHEALTHY LAB RESULTS, THAT WAS MEANT AS A JOKE.\nTWO DAYS AFTER THAT, DONALD TRUMP TWEETED THAT HE AGREED, HE\nSHOULD RELEASE MORE DETAILED MEDICAL RECORDS.\nAND THEN A WEEK LATER, DONALD TRUMP TOLD ABC NEWS THAT HE\nWOULD RELEASE FURTHER INFORMATION ON HIS HEALTH\nWHETHER OR NOT HILLARY DID AS WELL.\n>> DO YOU THINK HILLARY CLINTON DESERVES TO HEAR MORE ABOUT YOU.\n>> I WOULD LOVE TO GIVE SPECIFICS, AS FAR AS I'M\nCONCERNED AND IF SHE WANTS TO GO FIRST --\n>> WHY DON'T YOU GO FIRST? >> NOW THAT YOU ASK, I THESE I\nWILL DO THAT. >> NOW THAT YOU ASK -- BY THE\nEND OF THAT WEEK, WHICH IS LAST WEEK, WE GOT THIS ANNOUNCEMENT\nFROM THIS DAYTIME TV SHOW, THE DR. OZ SHOW ANNOUNCING THAT\nDONALD TRUMP WOULD BE APPEARING ON THAT DAYTIME TV SHOW WITH\nTHAT TV DOCTOR TO TALK ABOUT MR. DONALD TRUMP'S HEALTH.\nYESTERDAY THE HOST OF THAT DAYTIME TALK SHOW DR. OZ WENT ON\nFOX NEWS RADIO AND SAID TRUMP WOULD BE ACTUALLY HANDING OVER\nHIS MEDICAL RECORDS TO DR. OZ, TO THE HOST OF THAT TV SHOW LIVE\nON TV. THE MEDICAL RECORDS WOULD BE\nREVEALED ON TV. THEN INTERESTINGLY THIS MORNING\nTHAT WAS OFF. TRUMP TELLING REPORTERS THEY HAD\nBASICALLY CHANGED THEIR MIND, THEY WOULD NOT BE HANDING OVER\nTHEIR MEDICAL RECORDS OVER ON YOUR TV SHOW.\n>> JOHN ROBERTS JUST REPORTED A LITTLE WHILE AGO THAT HE'S GOING\nTO GO ON DR.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE.\nNO REPORTERS WERE AT IT THE TAPING, NOTHING HAS BEEN\nRELEASED PUBLICLY, WE'RE TOLD THAT WHAT HE HANDED OVER ON TV\nWAS A ONE PAGES MEDICAL SUMMARY FROM OUR OLD FRIEND DR.\nBORNSTEIN. I'M NOT SURE IF THERE ARE JOKES\nIN THIS ONE TOO. WE CAN REPORT THAT THE HOST OF\nTHE TV SHOW, DR.

OZ.\nIT'S AN AMAZING MOMENT 55 DAYS OUT FROM THE ELECTION DAY.\n>> WELL, I WAS JUST THINKING,  ADDITION TO ALL THE OTHER HEALTH\nISSUES, THE TWO CANDIDATES HAVE HAD A PERSONALITY TRANSPLANT\nBECAUSE HERE YOU HAVE HILLARY CLINTON SENDING OUT 20 TWEETS,\nSHE AND HER CAMPAIGN, 20 TWEETS IN ONE HOUR, SOUNDS LIKE TRUMP,\nAND TRUMP IS DISCLOSING MEDICAL RECORDS ON DR. OZ BEING\nTRANSPARENT THE DAY AFTER HE ANNOUNCED A BIG NEW PROPOSAL FOR\nA BIG GOVERNMENT SPENDING PROGRAM ON PAY MATERNITY LEAVE.\n>> IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. AND YOU WONDER WHAT KIND OF\nPRESSURE THIS IS GOING TO PUT ON HILLARY CLINTON AND HER CAMP TO\nRELEASE MORE OF HER MEDICAL HISTORY BECAUSE ACCORDING TO DR.\nOZ, HE WENT THROUGH A FULL REVIEW OF TRUMP'S SYSTEMS, AND\nLAUNDRY LISTED NERVOUS SYSTEM, HEAD AND NECK, HORMONE LEVELS,\nCARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH. I MEAN OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF PEOPLE\nARE GOING TO TUNE IN INTO THAT AND SEE HOW THAT WENT.\nHIS DOCTOR SAYS HE IS HEALTHY AND FIT TO BE PRESIDENT, BUT\nHILLARY CLINTON, WE'RE STILL WAITING, THEY ARE PROMISING THAT\nWE WILL SEE MORE OF HER MEDICAL HISTORY LATER ON THIS WEEK.\n>> WELL, TO BE FAIR, SHE HAD BEEN A LOT MORE TRANSPARENT UP\nUNTIL NOW THAN DONALD TRUMP HAD AS YOU REMEMBER, HE HAD HIS\nGASTROSBROLGS SEND A TWO-PARAGRAPH NOTE WHILE THE\nLIMOUSINE WAITING OUTSIDE SAID THAT TRUMP WILL BE THE\nHEALTHIEST PRESIDENT IN HISTORY, BUT AT THIS POINT, THE HEALTH\nTRANSPARENCY GAP NOW WORKS IN TRUMP'S FAVOR BECAUSE OF THE DR.\nOZ INCIDENT. SO SHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO GO ON\nSOME REALITY TV SHOW AND RELEASE ALL OF HER -- SERIOUSLY\nSPEAKING, SHE IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE MORE FORTHCOMING\nPARTICULARLY AFTER THIS HEALTH SCARE OVER THE WEEKEND.\n>> ABOUT THE WEIGHT LOSS YOU HEARD, APPARENTLY DONALD TRUMP\nSAID TO DR. OZ HE WOULD LIKE TO LOSE 15 TO 20 POUNDS, DR. OZ\nAGREED IS WHAT DR. OZ'S SHOW HAS TOLD US.\nFORMER SECRETARY OF STATE COLON POWELL REVEALING, CHRIS, HOW HE\nREALLY FEELS ABOUT BOTH OF THESE CANDIDATES.\nHACKERS LEAKING COLON POWELL'S PRIVATE E-MAILS.\nPOUFL WAS CALLING TRUMP A NATIONAL DISGRACE AND AN\nINTERNATIONAL PARIAH. HE ALSO SLAMS CLINTON FOR TRYING\nTO MAKE HIM A SCAPEGOAT IN THE HER E-MAIL SCANNEDING SAYING I\nTOLD HER STAFF THREE TIMES. I HAD TO THROW A MINI TANTRUM TO\nGET THEIR ATTENTION. SHE KEEPS TRIPPING INTO THESE\nCHARACTER MINE FIELDS. WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THESE\nE-MAIL REVELATIONS, CHRIS? >> WELL, I HAVE TO SAY, I MAKE\nMORE OF WHAT POWELL IS SAYING ABOUT CLINTON.\nPOWELL HAS BECOME A REPUBLICAN IN NAME ONLY.\nIF YOU REMEMBER HE SUPPORTED BARACK OBAMA AGAINST McCAIN IN\n2008, OBAMA AGAINST ROMNEY IN 2012, SO NO SURPRISE THAT HE\nWOULD NOT -- THE LANGUAGE IS KIND OF TOUGH, BUT NO SURPRISE\nTHAT HE WOULDN'T HAVE MUCH USE FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nBUT YOU CAN TELL, HE IS GENUINELY UPSET BY THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGNS. AND IT HAS BEEN AN EFFORT ON\nTHEIR PART TO SAY WELL SHE WAS JUST FOLLOWING THE ADVICE OF\nCOLON POWELL WHEN SHE SAID UP THIS PRIVATE SYSTEM.\nTHE FACT IS, THEY WERE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS.\nPOWELL DIDN'T HAVE A PRIVATE SERVER IN HIS BASEMENT, HE WAS\nUSING AOL.COM BACK IN 2005, OR 2000 RATHER, BACK WHEN THE WHOLE\nE-MAIL SYSTEM AND THE INTERNET WAS ALL COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.\nSO, YOU KNOW, I THINK WITH SOME JUSTICE, HE IS UPSET AT THE\nIDEAS. HE IS TRYING TO DRAG HIM INTO\nTHIS AND MAKE IT SEEM LIKE HE WAS THE REASON THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON SET UP THE PRIVATE SERVER.\n>> THERE WAS ALSO AN E-MAIL EXCHANGE WITH A DEMOCRATIC E\nMEGA DONOR, JEFFREY LEADS WAS IN THERE DEPICTING HER AS A SORE\nLOSER WHEN SHE LOST TO BARACK OBAMA SAYING SHE HATES THAT THE\nPRESIDENT KICKED HER BUTT IN 2008.\nSHE USED A DIFFERENT WORD THERE, BUT HE WENT ON TO SAY NO ONE\nLIKES HER AND THE CRIMINAL THING AIN'T OVER.\nI DON'T THINK THE PRESIDENT WOULD WEEP IF SHE FOUND HERSELF\nIN REAL LEGAL TROUBLE. WAS THIS ALSO VERY REVEALING OF\nTHE JITTERS THAT THE PARTY, THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN GENERAL IS\nFEELING RIGHT NOW OVER HILLARY CLINTON AND RECENT POLLING?\n>> OH SURE. LOOK, THIS RACE IS TIGHTENING,\nAND IT'S TIGHTENING I THINK FOR TWO REASONS.\nONE, DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN A MORE DISCIPLINED, BETTER\nCANDIDATE OVER THE LAST THREE, FOUR WEEKS SINCE HIS NEW TEAM\nTOOK OVER, AND AGAIN, THIS GOES TO THE PERSONALITY TRANSPLANT.\nHE IS DELIVERING MORE SPEECHES ON TELEPROMPTER, MORE POLICY IN\nHIS SPEECHES. YOU KNOW, THERE'VE BEEN SOME\nBUMPS IN THE ROAD, FOR INSTANCE GOING DOWN TO MEXICO, HAVING\nTHAT MEETING WITH THE MEXICAN PRESIDENT, THEN COMING BACK AND\nSEEMING TO GO BACK ON THE IDEA HE WAS GOING TO SOFTEN HIS\nPOSITION ON IMMIGRATION AND IN FACT DELIVERING A HARD LINE\nPOSITION, BUT MEANWHILE, THE NEWS HAS BEEN ALMOST ALL BAD FOR\nHILLARY CLINTON FOR SEVERAL WEEKS NOW.\nMORE REVELATIONS ABOUT THE E-MAIL, THE FBI 15,000 E-MAILS\nTHEY WERE ABLE TO RECOVER, THE COZY CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION, THE STATE DEPARTMENT, NOW THE HEALTH\nSCARE. SO NOT SURPRISINGLY ALL OF THIS\nHAS LED TO HIS RISE IN THE POLLS AND HER DECLINE.\nSTILL, VERY MUCH SHE'S STILL THE FAVORITE, BUT IF HE IS AHEAD BY\nFIVE POINTS IN OHIO, THAT'S A VERY TELLING SIGN.\nTHAT IS A, YOU KNOW, THE SWINGINGEST OF SWING STATES AND\nONE THAT THE REPUBLICANS ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO HAVE.\n>> THERE IS SO MUCH GOING ON IN THIS HORSE RACE AND YOU HAVE\nINTERESTING GUESTS ON FOX NEWS SUNDAY.\nWHO DO YOU HAVE? >> TOP OFFICIALS OF BOTH THE\nTRUMP AND CLINTON COMPANIES, BUT ALSO WE'RE GOING TO TALK TO\nGEORGE CLOONEY AND JOHN PRENDERGST.\nFASCINATING INVESTIGATION THEY'VE UNDERTAKEN.\nTHE HUMAN RIGHTS IN AFRICA, THEY HAVE SET UP SOMETHING CALLED THE\nCENTURY WHICH IS UNCOVERED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THEFT AND\nCORRUPTION IN SOUTH SUDAN. THE NEWEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD\nWITH MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN THAT COUNTRY BEING CAUGHT IN THE\nCROSS FIRE. WE'LL BE TALKING GEORGE CLOONEY\nABOUT THAT AND ALSO TALK SOME POLITICS, ALL COMING UP ON FOX\nNEWS SUNDAY. >> VERY GOOD STUFF, CHRIS\nWALLACE, THANKS FOR JOINING THUS AFTERNOON, GOOD TO HAVE YOU.\n>> YOU BET.",

FOR DAYS, DONALD TRUMP STAYED\nAWAY FROM QUESTIONS ABOUT CLINTON'S HEALTH, BUT LAST NIGHT\nHE BROUGHT UP THE QUESTION OF HER FITNESS ONCE MORE.\n>> I REALLY HAVE NO VIEW.

IT'S JUST BEEN A WEIRD DAY.\nBECAUSE OF HOW WEIRD OUR PRESIDENTIAL RACE IS,\nSPECIFICALLY RIGHT NOW, EVEN ON A DAY WITH NEWS THAT STRANGE,\nNEWS THAT OUTLANDISH AND SURPRISING, TODAY WAS ALSO THE\nDAY WHEN WE HAD TO LEARN THAT VIRGINIA SENATOR AND DEMOCRATIC\nVICE PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDER TIM KAINE, HE'S GOT A CYST ABOUT\nLIKE RIGHT HERE SOMEWHERE. I THINK RIGHT HERE.\nIT'S LIKE TWO CENTIMETERS BY FOUR CENTIMETERS, I THINK IT IS\nIN THIS GENERAL AREA, I WAS LOOKING AT THE ANATOMICAL MAPS,\nIT'S A SUBCUTANEOUS CYST, TWO SEPTEMBER METERS BY FOUR\nCENTIMETERS, APPARENTLY NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.\nTIM KAINE WE NOW KNOW HE ONCE TWISTED HIS SHOULDER.\nTIM KAINE TAKES NO MEDICATION, BUT HIS VITAMIN D IS LOW.\nTHE GOOD NEWS SENATOR KAREN, VITAMIN D COMES IN GUMMIES, IT'S\nTHE HIGHLIGHT OF MY DAY. NOW I KNOW HE USED TO HAVE\nPLANTAR FASCITIS, BUT IT'S NOW FEELING BETTER.\nTHE REASON WE KNOW ALL THIS INTIMATE DISTURBING DETAIL IS\nBECAUSE WE GOT A LOT OF MEDICAL INFORMATION ON TIM KAINE, TURNS\nOUT HE'S FINE. HE'S A LITTLE BIT HUSKY, HE'S\n5'11\" AND 207 POUNDS, A LITTLE ON THE STOCKY SIDE, BUT HE'S\nFINE. WE ALSO GOT HEALTH STATUS\nREPORTS ON JOE BIDEN AND PAUL RYAN, ON SARAH PALIN.\nON TIM KAINE, WE EXPECT ONE SOON ON MIKE PENCE.\nWE GOT A SECOND RELEASE OF HEALTH INFORMATION ABOUT HILLARY\nCLINTON'S HEALTH. THE CAMPAIGN SAYS THE LETTER\nTHEY RELEASED FROM HILLARY CLINTON'S DOCTOR LAST SUMMER WAS\nINTENDED TO BE AN OVERVIEW OF HER TOTAL HEALTH HISTORY AND\nSTATUS. THAT LETTER PAID SPECIAL\nATTENTION AND GAVE SPECIFIC DETAIL ABOUT WHAT THE CAMPAIGN\nDESCRIBED AS THE ONE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH ISSUE HILLARY CLINTON HAS\nHAD AS AN ADULT, WHICH IS THAT CONCUSSION SHE SUFFERED IN 2012.\nIN THAT UPDATED LETTER THEY RELEASED TODAY, THEY DESCRIBED\nAS BASICALLY AN UPDATE ON HER HEALTH STATUS SINCE THAT LAST\nLETTER LAST SUMMER. THEY SAY THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT\nHEALTH ISSUE SHE HAS HAD AS AN ADULT IS THAT CONCUSSION BACK IN\n2012, AND THAT NEW RELEASE GAVE QUITE A LOT OF DETAIL AND\nCHRONOLOGY ABOUT THAT EPISODE THAT SHE HAD THIS WEEKEND THAT\nCAUSED SO MUCH CONCERN, WHEN SHE FELL ILL AT THE 9/11 MEMORIAL\nSERVICE. NOW IT'S SINGLE SPACED AND IT'S\nA LOT OF DETAIL. IT FEELS WEIRD THAT WE'RE\nALLOWED TO KNOW THIS ABOUT ANOTHER PERSON, OUTSIDE OF\nOURSELVES OR OUR IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS, BUT PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATES ARE THE ONE GROUP OF PERSONS THAT DON'T GET THE SAME\nPRIVACY ON THESE MATTERS AS EVERY OTHER AMERICAN DOES, WE\nARE ALLOWED TO KNOW, AND WE EXPECT TO KNOW, THIS IS PART OF\nHOW WE MAKE OUR DECISION ON WHO WE FEEL COMFORTABLE VOTING FOR.\nNOW WE KNOW IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR, HILLARY CLINTON GOT\nSINUSITIS, AND SHE GOT AN EAR INFECTION, ANTIBIOTICS AND\nSTEROIDS DID NOT AL LEIGH THIS PROBLEM.\nIT SHOWED THAT THE SINUSITIS, IS MILD, BUT IT'S CHRONIC, IT'S NOT\nREALLY GOING AWAY, OTHER THAN THAT, ALL IS WELL, HER BRAIN IS\nFINE, NO ABNORMALIIES OF THE BRAIN.\nGOOD THAT WE CAN ALL BRAG ON THE SAME FEATURE.\nFAST FORWARD TO THIS MONTH, TO THE FRIDAY BEFORE THE 9/11\nEVENT, NOT TWO DAYS BEFORE THE 9/11 EVENT, SOME NINE DAYS\nBEFORE 9/11, SHE WENT TO SEE HER DOCTOR, SHE HAD FATIGUE, SHE HAD\nCON GUESTATION. THIS WAS AROUND THE TIME THAT\nHER CAMPAIGN MANAGER WAS HOSPITALIZED WITH AN UPPER\nRESPIRATORY INFECTION AS WELL. AFTER THAT SEPTEMBER 2 VISIT TO\nHER DAUGHTER, SHE APPARENTLY TOOK A SHORT-TERM COURSE OF\nANTIBIOTICS WHICH DID NOT HELP, SHE CAME BACK AND THAT'S WHEN\nTHE DOCTOR DID A NONCONTRAST CHEST CT SCAN, WHICH IS\nAPPARENTLY ONE STEP UP FROM A CHEST X RAY AND IT REVEALED,\nQUOTE, MILD, NONCONTAGIOUS BACTERIAL PNEUMONIA, THE DOCTOR\nSAYS THAT HILLARY CLINTON AT THAT POINT WAS ADVISED TO REST.\nWE NOW KNOW THAT SHE DID NOT. WE WENT BACK AND LOOKED AT OUR\nNBC COVERAGE CALENDAR, FROM THAT DAY THAT SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH\nPNEUMONIA, THAT SAME DAY, HILLARY CLINTON DID A\nFUND-RAISER IN MANHATTAN, SHE HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE, SHE DID\nMULTIPLE MEDIA INTERVIEWS, SHE DID ANOTHER FUND-RAISER,\nFOLLOWED BY ANOTHER FUND RAISER AND SHE WENT TO ANOTHER MEMORIAL\nSERVICE ON SUNDAY AND THAT WAS WHEN SHE HAD THAT EPISODE THAT\nFREQUENTED EVERYBODY OUT. SECRETARY CLINTON CONTINUES TO\nIMPROVE, SHE'S BEEN OFF THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL RESTING SINCE\nSUNDAY, BUT SHE'S DUE BACK ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL TOMORROW IN\nNORTH CAROLINA. THE NEW LETTER FROM CLINTON'S\nDOCTOR CONCLUDES AS FOLLOWS, QUOTE, MY OVERALL IMPRESSION\nTHAT IS THAT MRS. CLINTON HAS REMAINED HEALTHY AND HAS NOT\nDEVELOPED NEW MEDICAL CONDITIONS THIS YEAR OTHER THAN A SINUS\nINFECTION AND AN EAR INFECTION OTHER THAN HER CURRENT STATUS OF\nPNEUMONIA, AND SHE CONTINUES TO BE HEALTHY AND FIT TO SERVE AS\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THEY BASICALLY NOW CONSIDER THIS\nDONE, THEY HAVE NOW RELEASED IN THEIR ESTIMATION MUCH MORE\nDETAILED HEALTH INFORMATION THAN OTHER HEALTHY PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATES DID, PEOPLE LIKE BARACK OBAMA OR MITT ROMNEY.\nTHEY SAY THEY ARE NOT PLANNING WHAT SOME PEOPLE CALL A FULL\nMcCAIN, A UNIVERSAL RELEASE OF HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF\nPAGES, EVERY HEALTH RELATED DOCUMENT THAT'S EVER BEEN\nPRODUCED OVER THE COURSE OF HILLARY CLINTON'S LIFETIME, THEY\nSAID THAT KIND OF RELEASE IS NOT WARRANTED.\nESSENTIALLY BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH HISTORY IS\nNOTHING LIKE JOHN McCAIN'S HEALTH HISTORY, NOT LEAST\nBECAUSE OF HIS MULTIPLE AND RECURRING BATTLES WITH CANCER,\nWHICH SHE HAS NOTHING NEAR. SO AS FAR AS THEY'RE CONCERNED\nTHEY'RE DONE. ON THE OTHER SIDE, NATURALLY\nIT'S NOW UTTER AND COMPLETE CHAOS.\nAND THE DIFFICULT PART OF THIS FOR ME IS THAT I THINK PART OF\nIT MIGHT BE MY FAULT.

WHY IT'S IMPORTANT THIS CYCLE IS\nBECAUSE BOTH HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP, IF EITHER WERE\nELECTED, WOULD BE THE OLDEST PRESIDENT AT THEIR INAUGURATION.\nRONALD REAGAN WAS 69 WHEN HE TOOK OFFICE.\nDONALD TRUMP IS 70. AND AS WE KNOW, HILLARY CLINTON\nIS 69. THE ISSUE OF HEALTH IS REALLY\nIMPORTANT. OF COURSE, IT HAS BEEN\nHIGHLIGHTED MOST RECENTLY BY THE CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING CLINTON\nAND THE PNEUMONIA DIAGNOSIS AND TIME SHE DISCLOSED IT.\nTHAT'S WHAT PUT IT FRONT AND CENTER THIS WEEK.\nAS WE KNOW, CANDIDATES TRADITIONALLY HAVE BEEN SLIGHTLY\nMORE FORTHCOMING IN TERMS OF THEIR MEDICAL HISTORY.\nCLINTON HAS BEEN MORE FORTH COMING THAN DONALD TRUMP HAS.\nWE KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S MEDICAL HISTORY.\nREMEMBER IN 2008, JOHN McCAIN KIND OF SET THAT STANDARD OF\nRELEASING 1200 PAGES OF DOCUMENTS THAT REPORTERS --\n>> A LOT OF GOOD THAT DID JOHN McCAIN.\nRIGHT? HE HAD DOCTORS POURING OVER THE\nINFORMATION. THEY COULDN'T LEAVE A ROOM.\nTHEY CONVEYED THAT TO JOURNALISTS COVERING THE\nCAMPAIGN. IT DIDN'T DO SQUAT FOR HIM.\n>> Caller: IT WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE HE HAD THE HISTORY WITH\nMELANOMA. THAT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER.\nKERRY, OF COURSE, HAD MEDICAL ISSUES AS WELL.\nRIGHT NOW, THE QUESTION THIS WEEK -- THE POLITICAL QUESTION\nIS REALLY AROUND TRANSPARENCY. AND THIS IDEA THAT THESE\nCANDIDATES SHOULD BE DISCLOSING MORE ABOUT THEMSELVES THAN THEY\nCURRENTLY ARE. >> WELL PUT.\nTHANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR A LOT OF YOU TUNING IN, A\nDAY THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE CHANGED A LITTLE BIT IN STATES\nTHAT LOOKED IMPOSSIBLE FOR DONALD TRUMP, MORE POSSIBLE.\nTHE DRAMATIC NEWS OF THE DAY IS THE FACT THAT AN ESTABLISHED\nDOCTOR HERE IN NEW YORK CITY SAID JUNK FOOD IS PERFECTLY FINE\nIN MODERATION.

ANY TIME THE PRICE OF OIL DROPS\nAS IT DID TODAY, PLUMMETING $1.26 DOWN TO $43.64 ANY TIME\nOILS RALLY, THAT'S A SIGN DEMAND IS PICKING UP.\nI MEAN RIDICULOUS. THIS IS RIDICULOUS.\nTHE PRICE OF CRUDE IS THE SUM OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND, OKAY?\nWITH SUPPLY READY TO OVERWHELM ANY DEMAND, EVEN DEMAND THAT'S\n10, 15, 20% STRONGER THAN IT IS NOW.\nWHEN U.S. OIL INVENTORIES DROP AS THEY DID TODAY, YOU HAVE A\nFLEETING RALLY IN CRUDE AND THEN A DECLINE BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE\nTHAT THERE'S STILL A GLUT. TOO MUCH OIL BEING PRODUCED.\nLATER AS OIL HEADS TO $40 FROM $43, YOU THEN GET A REBOUND\nBECAUSE THE COUNTRIES THAT WANT THE PRICE HIGHER SPREAD RUMORS\nOF AN EMERGENCY OPEC MEETING TO FREEZE PRODUCTION.\nTHIS RUMOR MONGERING WORKS LIKE A CHARM EVERY TIME.\nIN OTHER WORDS, THE PRICE OF OIL, IT'S MANIPULATED.\nIT'S BOGUS. AND IT HAS LITTLE TO NOTHING TO\nDO WITH THE REAL DEMAND WE NEED TO CALCULATE TO MAKE OUR WORLD\nVIEW, EVEN AS IT'S THE METRIC OF CHOICE FOR SO MANY FUND\nMANAGERS. OTHERS USE THE PRICE OF METALS\nLIKE COPPER AND STEEL. ONE OF THE REASONS IS COPPER HAS\nBEEN DISPLACED BY OTHER MATERIALS.\nIT'S AN INDICATOR OF NOTHING. SO WHAT AM I LOOKING AT?\nIN THE U.S. FIRST IT'S EMPLOYMENT.\nI'M STILL ENCOURAGED. I THINK EMPLOYMENT IS RELATIVELY\nSTRONG. IT'S WHY I DON'T FEAR A RATE\nHIKE AS MUCH AS OTHERS. THAT'S BASED ON MY FORECAST BAY\nLOOKING BACK AT WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE FED TIGHTENED IN\nSEPTEMBER.

HOW ABOUT NON-REALLY\nCONSTRUCTION? BIG CHUNK.\nBIG CHUNK OF THE BUSINESS. I SPEAK TO SEVERAL COMPANIES IN\nEVERY SILO OF NON-REALLY FROM THE CONSTRUCTION LOANS IN ALL\nGEOGRAPHIES TO THE MATERIALS NEEDED TO ERECT BUILDINGS TO THE\nFIXTURES, HEATING, AIR-CONDITIONING, LIGHTING,\nVENTILATION COMPANIES. MY JUDGMENT?\nTHINGS ARE PRETTY GOOD.

THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.\n>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. >> WE'RE GOING TO TALK\nCOMPETITIVENESS WITH MICHAEL PORTER, BUT BEFORE WE DO LET'S\nTALK VANGUARD. OVER THE COURSE OF THIS YEAR,\nYOUR FIRM HAS TAKEN IN MORE MONEY THAN ANY OF THE OTHER BIG\nFUNDS OUT THERE. SOMETHING LIKE $112 BILLION.\nSO WHY DON'T YOU TELL US ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING AND WHY YOU\nTHINK INVESTORS ARE PILING INTO VANGUARD FUNDS.\n>> WELL, I THINK THERE HAVE BEEN A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT HAVE\nCONTRIBUTED TO THIS. YOU KNOW, ONE IS THERE'S REALLY\nBEEN A MOVE AMONG, YOU KNOW, A BROADER ARRAY OF INVESTORS TO\nMORE MARKET MATCHING STRATEGIES. SO THE INDEX STORY, IF YOU WILL,\nHAS BEEN REALLY GETTING MUCH WIDER ACCEPTANCE THAN IT -- THAN\nWE'D SEEN HISTORICALLY. ACTUALLY, THE NUMBERS SO FAR\nTHROUGH THE END OF AUGUST ARE ABOUT $200 BILLION INTO OUR\nVARIOUS FUNDS. AND MOST OF THAT IS IN TWO\nCATEGORIES. YOU KNOW, BROAD INDEX FUNDS\nWHICH GIVE PEOPLE BROAD MARKET EXPOSURE AT VERY LOW COST.\nAND THEN THE SECOND BIG CATEGORY ARE OUR TARGET DATE FUNDS WHICH\nARE VERY POPULAR IN THE 401(k) ARENA.\nI THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY A REALLY ENCOURAGING SIGN THAT SO MANY\nINVESTORS ARE USING THESE TARGET RETIREMENT SOLUTIONS, IF YOU\nWILL, TO SET THEMSELVES UP FOR RETIREMENT.\n>> PART OF THIS IS COMING THAT FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW ACTIVE\nINVESTORS HAVE HAD A MUCH TOUGHER TIME.\nTHEY'VE HAD A TOUGHER TIME MATCHING UP TO THE INDEXES.\nWHEN YOU SEE SWINGS LIKE THAT, YOU DO SEE PEOPLE SAY FORGET\nABOUT IT. I'M NOT GOING TO TRY TO BEAT THE\nMARKET WHEN EVEN THE PROS CAN'T BEAT THE MARKET.\nBUT WITH THIS CYCLICAL SWING, HOW MUCH OF IT DO YOU THINK\nSTICKS THIS TIME AROUND? HOW MANY OF THESE INVESTORS CAN\nYOU KEEP IF THERE IS SUDDENLY A PERIOD WHERE THE INDICES DO\nPOORLY AND ACTIVE MANAGERS ARE OUT PERFORMING?\n>> YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT'S A QUESTION THAT WE GET A FROM A\nLOT OF INVESTORS. I THINK THERE IS ALWAYS A\nCYCLICAL ELEMENT TO THIS. SO WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING COULD\nCERTAINLY HAPPEN. BUT I THINK THERE'S A MUCH MORE\nSECULAR CHANGE GOING ON HERE. YOU KNOW, EARLIER IN YOUR SHOW\nYOU HAD SALLIE KRAWCHECK ON WHO WAS TALKING ABOUT HER NEW\nVENTURE. IF I HEARD CORRECTLY, SALLIE'S\nSET UP A SERIES OF PORTFOLIOS FOR HER CLIENTS THAT ARE USING\nLOW COST ETFs, INDEX BASED FUNDS TO CREATE SOLUTIONS FOR\nINVESTORS. SO WE'RE SEEING A BIG TREND.\nIT'S COMING FROM SOME OF THE FIN TECHES, TRADITIONAL ADVISERS,\nAND THEN OF COURSE INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS THEMSELVES ARE\nCHOOSING TO DO THIS. IT'S LESS SORT OF POINT SOLUTION\nJUST FLOWING INTO A PRODUCT. IT'S ABOUT A HOLISTIC APPROACH.\nAND I THINK THAT'S THE SECULAR ELEMENT.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT COMPETITIVENESS.\nWHY MICHAEL PORTER IS HERE AND WHY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IT.\nIF YOU LOOK AT YOUR BUSINESS, YOU'VE DONE VERY WELL.\nWHAT WORRIES YOU ABOUT COMPETITIVENESS IN THE UNITED\nSTATES? >> WELL, YOU KNOW, MICHAEL'S\nSTUDY IS JUST OUT. MICHAEL, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR\nGIVING ME AT LEAST 12 HOURS TO DIGEST IT ALL.\nIT'S A TERRIFIC PIECE OF WORK. AND I THINK IT UNDERSCORES\nTOPICS THAT HAVE BEEN VERY MUCH FRONT OF MIND FOR THE LAST\nSEVERAL YEARS FOR MANY PEOPLE. AND, YOU KNOW, WHAT WORRIES US\nIS THAT THE ECONOMY BROADLY HAS NOT BEEN GROWING AT THE RATE\nTHAT WE THINK IT NEEDS TO GROW. AND ONE OF THE, YOU KNOW, HUGE\nIMPACTS OF THAT IS WE'RE NOT LIFTING THE STANDARD OF LIVING\nFOR AS MANY PEOPLE AS WE COULD. AND I THINK AT THE HEART OF IT,\nTHAT'S REALLY WHAT A LOT OF THE WORK POINTS TO.\nAND SOME OF THE PRESCRIPTIONS FOR, YOU KNOW, MOVING FORWARD IN\nTHE HARVARD WORK REALLY TRY TO GET AT THAT.\nYOU KNOW, I'D ADD TO IT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS A PERVASIVE\nISSUE THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY CALLED OUT IN THE PAPER BUT IT'S\nREALLY IMPLIED. I THINK THERE'S A TREMENDOUS\nOVER-EMPHASIS ON THE SHORT-TERM. AND THIS IS -- THIS OCCURS IN\nTHE POLITICAL ARENA. IT OCCURS IN RUNNING BUSINESSES.\nAND IT OCCURS IN THE INVESTMENT ARENA.\nAND I THINK ONE OF THE REAL CALLS TO ACTION HAS TO BE TO --\nFOR EVERYONE TO TAKE A MUCH LONGER TERM PERSPECTIVE.\n>> MICHAEL, ONE OF THE ISSUES YOU ALL POINT OUT IS THAT WE\nHAVE NOT GOTTEN BACK TO THE MEDIAN PAY LEVELS WE WERE\nLOOKING AT FOR MIDDLE INCOME HOUSES SINCE 1999.\nBUT WE DID SEE A BIG JUMP OVER THE LAST YEAR AND THOSE\nSTATISTICS THAT WERE JUST RELEASED THIS WEEK.\nIS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU THINK WE CAN MAKE A MOVE AND GET BACK\nTO SOME OF THESE LEVELS? BUT IS IT STILL NOT ENOUGH\nPROGRESS FOR YOU? >> AGAIN, IT'S VERY ENCOURAGING\nTO SEE MEDIAN INCOME GO UP AFTER 17, 18 YEARS OF DECLINE --\nCONTINUOUS DECLINE. IT BUMPED UP WHETHER THAT'S AN\nANOMALY OR A NEW TREND IS STILL UNCLEAR.\nBUT I MEAN, THE COLD HARD TRUTH IS WE'RE STILL 18 YEARS BEHIND.\nWE'RE STILL GETTING CLOSER TO WHERE WE WERE 18 YEARS AGO.\nAND WE DON'T SEE STRUCTURALLY IN THE TERMS OF UNDERPINNINGS OF\nSKILL, EDUCATION, AND THE KIND OF FUNDAMENTALS OF\nCOMPETITIVENESS. WE DON'T SEE THE UNDERPINNINGS\nRIGHT YET THAT ARE GOING TO TURN THAT INTO A KIND OF NEW ERA OF\nGROWTH AND PROSPERITY. YOU KNOW, IT'S GREAT.\nIT REMINDS ME WE'VE BEEN IN THIS GAME NOW FOR FIVE OR SIX YEARS.\nWE HAVE A JOBS REPORT AND IT LOOKS A LITTLE GOOD AND WE SAY\nGOOD WE'RE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.\nTHEN TWO JOBS REPORTS LATER, THINGS GO DOWN.\nAND THE COLD HEART TRUTH AND BILL SAID THIS IS GROWTH IS VERY\nSLOW COMPARED TO OUR TRADITION. PRODUCTIVITY IS NOT IMPROVING\nVERY RAPIDLY. INVESTMENT IS LOW IN OUR\nECONOMY. AND SO UNFORTUNATELY I THINK\nTHAT WE'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH SOME FUNDAMENTALS.\nTHERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE'VE ALLOWED TO SLIP AND THEY\nPARTICULARLY HURT THE AVERAGE CITIZEN, THE PERSON WITHOUT A\nLOT OF SKILL, THE SMALLER COMPANY.\nAND WE'RE JUST NOT MAKING PROGRESS.\n>> MICHAEL, DO YOU SEE, THOUGH, IN THE PRESIDENTIAL DIALOGUE,\nTHE PRESIDENTIAL RACES THERE'S ENOUGH DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS?\nTHERE'S ENOUGH IDENTIFICATION OF THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE THAT\nLEADS YOU TO CONCLUDE THAT SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN?\nYOU'VE BEEN AFTER THIS FOR FIVE YEARS WITH SOME -- ALWAYS WITH\nSOME INSIGHTFUL THOUGHTS ON THE SUBJECT.\nYET WE CONTINUE TO REGRESS. IS THERE ANY REASON FOR\nOPTIMISM? >> WELL, LARRY, YOU KNOW,\nTHERE'S REASON FOR OPTIMISM ABOUT AMERICA.\nWE HAVE SOME TERRIFIC COMPANIES. WE HAVE GOOD MANAGEMENT.\nWE HAVE A LOT OF STRENGTHS THAT WE TALK ABOUT IN OUR REPORT.\nAMERICA'S A DYNAMIC PLACE. BUT FRANKLY OVER THESE FIVE\nYEARS THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS, I'VE COME TO BELIEVE THAT\nACTUALLY THERE'S THE OVER-ARCHING PROBLEM RIGHT NOW\nIS ACTUALLY THE POLITICAL SYSTEM.\nIT'S WHAT THE SYSTEM IS DELIVERING.\nIT'S JUST NOT DELIVERING SOLUTIONS.\n>> YOU MEAN THE WAY WE FIND OUR CANDIDATES, THE WAY YOU HAVE TO\nRISE UP THROUGH? >> THE WAY WE FIND OUR\nCANDIDATES. THE WAY THAT THE DIALOGUE IS NOT\nABOUT SOLVING A PROBLEM. IT'S ABOUT ESSENTIALLY DIVIDING\nTHE ELECTORATE FOR ONE OR THE OTHER.\nWE DISCUSS EVERYTHING IN A VERY SIMPLISTIC WAY.\nTRADE IS GOOD, TRADE IS BAD. WELL, TRADE IS COMPLICATED.\nAND OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT WE WANT TO EXPAND TRADE.\nWE WANT ACCESS TO INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.\nBUT WE'RE NOT HAVING A PRODUCTIVE DIALOGUE AND WE'RE\nNOT GETTING ANYTHING DONE. >> WE'RE ALMOST OUT OF TIME.\nBUT BEFORE WE LET YOU GO, WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON THE MARKETS RIGHT\nNOW? I KNOW YOU'VE MADE SOME COMMENTS\nIN THE PAST ABOUT HOW SOME STOCK PRICES HAVE YOU A LITTLE\nCONCERNED. WHAT DO YOU THINK RIGHT NOW WHEN\nYOU SEE WHERE WE'VE COME? >> SO, YOU KNOW, WE TEND TO LOOK\nAT THINGS OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME.\nSO AS I SORT OF LOOK OUT OVER THE NEXT DECADE, WHEN WE LOOK AT\nVALUATION AND WE LOOK AT EARNINGS AND SO FORTH, OUR\nMODELS POINT TOWARD A MUCH LOWER ABSOLUTE RETURN OVER THE NEXT\nDECADE THAN WE'VE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO OVER THE PAST,\nSAY, 30 YEARS. AND WE'RE LOOKING AT THE EQUITY\nMARKET BEING IN THE SORT OF 6% TO 7% RANGE PER YEAR OVER THE\nNEXT DECADE. AND I WOULD TELL YOU THAT'S IF\nTHINGS GO REASONABLY WELL. AND SOME OF WHAT MICHAEL IS\nDESCRIBING GETS ADDRESSED. THAT'S BASED ON WHERE WE ARE\nFROM A VALUATION STANDPOINT. IN THE SHORT RUN, I HAVE NO MORE\nIDEA THAN ANYBODY ELSE BUT OVER THE NEXT DECADE THAT'S KIND OF\nTHE WAY WE'RE THINKING ABOUT IT. >> BILL, REAL QUICK ON THE\nACTIVE PASSIVE DEBATE, WHAT PERCENTAGE OF YOUR BUSINESS NOW\nIS ACTIVE? BECAUSE I ALWAYS THINK OF\nVANGUARD AS AN INDEX COMPANY BUT I KNOW A LOT OF YOUR BUSINESS\nSTILL IS ACTIVE. >> SO WE'RE ABOUT 65% INDEX AND\n35% ACTIVE. AND THAT ACTIVE IS BOTH ON THE\nFIXED INCOME SIDE AND ON THE EQUITIES SIDE.\n>> AND DO YOU SEE THAT CHANGING? INCREASING?\n>> I THINK OVER TIME.

IF ELECTED AT AGE 70 YOU WOULD\nBE THE OLDEST PERSON TO ENTER THE OVAL OFFICE .\nWHY DO YOU HAVE THE STAMINA? >> JUST ABOUT THE SAME AGE AS\nRONALD REAGAN AND HILLARY IS A YEAR BEHIND ME.\nI WOULD SAY JUST BASED ON MY LIFE.\nI'VE HAD -- I ACTUALLY -- AND I DON'T KNOW IF THIS MAKES SENSE,\nI FEEL AS GOOD TODAY AS I DID WHEN I WAS 30.\n>> HE'S 6'3\" TALL, HE WEIGHS 236 POUNDS ALTHOUGH FROM THE\nAUDIENCE, AND DURING THE TAPING HE SAID 2267 POUNDS.\nTHE DESIRED WEIGHT IS 152 TO 199, 200 TO 239 IS OVER WEIGHT\nIF HE'S 267, THAT WOULD BE OBESE FROM 240 TO 311 POUNDS SO WHAT\nDO YOU MAKE OF THAT? [ LAUGHTER ]\n>> I'M WITH ERWIN ON THIS. HE SAYS HE FEELS LIKE HE'S 30\nYEARS OLD, WHO KNOWS. I WISH I FELT LIKE I WAS 30\nYEARS OLD.

THE NEXT MOVE DOES INVOLVE\nADDITIONAL STIMULUS AND THE SITUATION IS THE SAME IN EUROPE.\nTHE ECB KNOWS THAT IT'S GOING TO SOMEHOW ADJUST ITS PROGRAM\nBECAUSE IT'S RUNNING OUT OF TIME AND BONDS TO BUY, BUT THEY DON'T\nHAVE TO DO THAT UNTIL DECEMBER SO THAT, YOU KNOW, GIVES THEM\nTIME TO MAKE IT POLITICALLY PAL ITABLE TO THE REST OF THE\nGOVERNING COUNCIL. THAT'S CAUSING SOME NEAR TERM\nVOLATILITY. I THINK IT'S GOING TO GO AWAY,\nQUITE FRANKLY, BECAUSE STIMULUS IS HERE TO STAY.\n>> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE ONE-YEAR AND HOW DOES IT DRIVE\nYOUR INVESTMENT DECISIONS BASED ON WHERE IT GOES NEXT?\n>> I THINK A COUPLE OF THINGS. ONE IS IF YOU DO BELIEVE THAT\nCENTRAL BANKS ARE PULLING BACK, IT MEANS THAT THERE'S GOING TO\nBE LESS BUYING DEMAND AT THE LONG END OF THE YIELD CURVE AND\nTHAT WILL SPILL OVER INTO THE U.S., BUT I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT\nTHAT WE'RE JUST BACK TO WHERE THE TEN YEAR YIELD WAS BEFORE\nTHE BREXIT VOTE. WE'RE EXACTLY AT THE SAME LEVEL.\nSO, YOU KNOW, I WOULDN'T READ TOO MUCH INTO IT AT THIS POINT.\nIF YOU LAP TO BE LONG, HOWEVER, OBVIOUSLY, IT'S BEEN PAINFUL.\nBUT I THINK BEGINNING NEXT WEEK, YOU KNOW, WITH THE BOJ'S MEETING\nAND THEN FOLLOWING ON LATER IN THE QUARTER WITH THE ECB'S\nMEETING, I THINK WE'LL GET",

WE'RE STUCK AT A SLIGHTLY WEAKER\nRETAIL NUMBER AFTER THE JULY NUMBER.\nI THINK THE INCOMING DATA IS PROBABLY GOING PLAY LESS OF A\nROLE THAN PERHAPS THE FEDSPEAK DID COMING IN.\nI THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE GOING TO CRUISE INTO THE MEETING.\nSNOOP WE'VE SEEN THAT YIELDING CURVE STEEPING HIGHER.\nTHAT'S BEEN SPOOKING STOCKS. WHAT DO YOU THINK?\n>> TWO THINGS. ONE, IT IS NOT THE POPPING OF\nTHE BOND BUBBLE. >> WHY NOT?\n>> FIRST OF ALL, WE DON'T THINK THE GLOBAL LOOSE MONETARY\nPOLICY, YOU KNOW, REGIME IS OVER.\nWE DON'T BELIEVE THE FED IS GOING TO RAISE RATES IN\nSEPTEMBER AND VERY UNLIKELY TO RAISE RATES IN DECEMBER AS WELL.\nNUMBER TWO, THERE'S AN ENORMOUS WALL OF MONEY OUT THERE, $10\nTRILLION ESTIMATED, YIELDING PAPER, WHICH AS SOON AS THOSE\nNUMBERS START RISING SIGNIFICANTLY, THE U.S. CURVE\nSTARTS RALLYING SIGNIFICANTLY, WE SEE THAT MONEY POUR RIGHT\nBACK INTO IT AND SUPPRESS THE YIELD RALLY.\nWE SAW THAT ON FRIDAY WHEN THE GERMAN YIELD TICKED ABOVE\nNEGATIVE LEVELS. ALL OF A SUDDEN EVERYBODY RUSHED\nFROM THE U.S. INTO GERMAN PAPER. I THINK THAT WALL OF MONEY WILL\nSUPPRESS ANY TYPE OF POPPING OF THE BUBBLE.\n>> WHAT'S A FAIR LEVEL FOR THE U.S. TENURE?\nWE WERE AT THREE-MONTH HIGHS ON THE YIELD.\n1.75. WE'RE NOW AT 1.71.\nWHERE ARE WE GOING. >> AGAIN, WE HAVE A SUBDUED OR\nDOVISH VIEW ON THE ECONOMY AND I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE EXPRESSED\nVERY CLEARLY. I DO BELIEVE 1.06, 1.65 IS A\nSAFER BET CONCERNING WHAT EVERYTHING ELSE IS DOING.\nALL OF THAT IS GOING TO KEEP A LID ON WHERE THE U.S. TENURES\nCAN GO. SO OVERALL WE THINK THE MIXED\nDATA OF THE U.S. IS REALLY NOT GOING TO PUT TOO MUCH PRESSURE\nON THE YIELD CURVE. >> YOU SAY YOU CONTINUE TO\nREHOLD ON THE SHORTS THAT YOU ALREADY HOLD.\n>> CORRECT. WE DON'T BELIEVE IN THIS SORT OF\nRALLY. WE DON'T BELIEVE IN THIS YIELD\nRALLY AS WELL. SO WE THINK THAT, YOU KNOW,\nLOOKING FOR MORE VALUE, CHASING THAT YIELD WHILE, YOU KNOW, IT\nMIGHT BE UNATTRACTIVE AND ONE THAT'S COMPLETELY OVERPLAYED AT\nTHIS POINT, IT'S STILL GOING TO BE THE BEST BET OUT THERE.\n>> WHAT ARE SOME OF THE SHORTS? >> WELL, ONE OF THE SHORTS WOULD\nPROBABLY BE THINGS LIKE THE DOLLAR, SWISS FRANC, MOVING INTO\nYEN TRADES, E.M. CURRENCIES. MEXICO, HIGH RISK.\nWE THINK THIS BLAST WE'VE SEEN RECENTLY IS NOT GOING TO HOLD UP\nAND WHEN PEOPLE START REALIZING THE FED IS NOT GOING TO DO\nANYTHING AND WE'RE IN THAT SORT OF GOLDILOCKS POSITION WHERE LOW\nINTEREST RATES, LOW GROWTH ARE GOING TO KEEP CENTRAL BANKS\nCONSERVATIVE, WE'LL SEE IT COME DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY.\n>> CAN I ASK YOU ABOUT THE SNB. IS IT FAIR TO SAY THE SNB IS\nREACTING TO THE OTHER AT THIS POINT?\n>> IT COULD BE. IF THEY WERE TRYING TO SET\nPOLICY, THEY WOULD PROBABLY GET WASHED OVER.\nSO I THINK BY STANDING ASIDE AND UNDERSTANDING THE CAPABILITIES,\nTHAT'S CRITICAL. I THINK WHAT'S ALSO NOTICEABLE\nIS THEIR COMMUNICATION STRATEGY IS VERY TIGHTER THAN WHAT WE SEE\nIN THE FEDS ESPECIALLY WHERE EVERY FED MEMBER IS COMING OUT\nAND PUSHING THEIR IDEAS AND GETTING INTERPRETED BY THE\nMARKET AND CAUSING SIGNIFICANTLY ROGUE VOLATILITY OUT OF NOWHERE\nAND EXTREMELY DISRUPTIVE. THE SNB IS MUCH MORE\nCONSERVATIVE AND HAS BEEN -- YOU KNOW, THEY HAVEN'T HAD A\nSIGNIFICANT POLICY SPEECH SINCE, I DON'T KNOW, APRIL OR MAY OF\nTHIS YEAR. SO IT ALLOWS THE MARKET TO SORT\nOF LOOK AT THE DA TARKS YOU KNOW, NOT TRY TO INTERPRET\nEVERYTHING THAT'S BEING SAID. AND I THINK IT'S A VERY GOOD WAY\nAND A GOOD MODEL FOR MANY CENTRAL BANKS MOVING FORWARD.\n>> NOW IT BRINGS ME TO THE BOJ. MAYBE THERE'S TOO MUCH TALK, TOO\nMUCH EXPECTATIONS. WE DID SEE A WEAKENING OF THE\nYEN THERE. DO YOU THINK THAT'S SUSTAIN\nSNBL. >> I THINK THEY WERE CAUGHT IN\nTHIS SORT OF COMMUNICATION TRAP, YOU KNOW, WHERE THEY'VE\nEXPRESSED WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO WITH ECONOMICS AND THEY\nSAY HOW THEY'RE GOING TO TARGET INFLATION, AND NONE OF IT'S COME\nTRUE. THE CREDIBILITY IS REALLY IN A\nROCKY PLACE, THEY'RE PROBABLY GOING TO COME OUT WITH AN\nASSESSMENT THAT SAYS WE NEED MORE TIME, MORE INFLATION MARKS.\nTHEY COULD PROBABLY TAKE A GOOD STANCE IN LEARNING WHAT THE\nSNB'S DONE. I THINK THAT'S A GOOD EXAMPLE.\nWE DON'T EXPECT SOMETHING AT NEXT WEEK'S MEETING.\nIT'S JUST GOING TO SAY THE POLICY'S NOT WORKING.\nWE'LL CONTINUE TO SEE REPETRIE YAGS.\n>> THEY CAN GET BACK BEYOND 1.05, YOU SAY?\n>> I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY CHALLENGING.\nTHE DOLLAR/YEN TRADES SIGNIFICANTLY O ON THE\nDOLLAR/YEN SPREAD AND WE'RE SEEING A PRIOR WIDENING OF THE\nFRONT END YIELDS, SO AS THAT CONTRACTS, I THINK WE'LL SEE\nCONTINUED STRENGTH IN THE YEN.

IS IT DOING MORE HARM THAN GOOD?\nSTEVE LIESMAN JOINS US WITH MORE ABOUT HOW THE FED REALLY CAME\nUNDER FIRE YESTERDAY. >> IT DID PLENTY OF CRITICISM\nYESTERDAY FOR THE FEDERAL RESERVE, DELIVERING ALPHA\nCONFERENCE. SHOWING SOME OF THE NATION'S TOP\nINVESTORS NOT IN GREAT AGREEMENT WITH THE NATION'S TOP CENTRAL\nBANKERS. >> EVER DECLINING RATES HAVE NOT\nCREATED A SUSTAINABLE ACCELERATING UPTICK IN GROWTH.\n>> THE FED IS PUTTING TOO MUCH EMPHASIS ON BUSINESS CYCLE.\nAND NOT ENOUGH ON THE LONG-TERM DEBT CYCLE.\n>> WE NEED TO FIX OUR TAX SYSTEM, CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES AND\nLOWER THE STATUTORY TAX RATE. >> NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES POSE\nA HUGE HEAD WIND FOR INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE TO MEET\nLONG-TERM LIABILITY COMMITMENTS. >> THE IDEA YOU SHOULD RAISE\nRATES TO REPLENISH THE ARSENAL AND SLOW THE ECONOMY, THAT'S A\nWEIRD ARGUMENT TO MAKE. NOT TRUE THE MAJOR GOVERNMENTS\nARE COMPLETELY OUT OF AMMUNITION.\n>> SO WHEN JAMIE DIMON SAYS TO RAISE INTEREST RATES, YOU THINK\nTHAT'S WRONG? >> THAT'S RIGHT.\nI THINK THAT'S RIGHT. >> THERE ARE OTHERS WHO DISAGREE\nWITH THE LOW RATE POLICY AND SOME ARE AT THE FED.\nTHIS SHOWS DISSENTS. MOSTLY GOVERNORS DISSENTED TO\nEASE AND PRESIDENTS DISSENTS TO TIGHTEN.\nIT HAS BEEN SINCE 2005 THAT A FED GOVERNOR DISSENTED.\nSINCE 1990, MOST HAVE COME FROM PRESIDENTS TO TITAN AND THE\nMAJORITY HAVE COME IN OPPOSITION TO THE LOW RATES THAT FOLLOW THE\nFINANCIAL CRISIS. THAT BLUE LINE SHOOTING UP OUR\nPRESIDENTIAL DISSENTS. THAT'S A SIGN, THAT A LOT OF THE\nFED BANK PRESIDENTS AGREE WITH OUR DELIVERING ALPHA INVESTORS.\nAND NOT ESPECIALLY -- TO THE PERIOD OF PROLONGED INTEREST\nRATES. >> BILL MILLER WENT AS FAR AS TO\nSAY THE REASON HE WAS CALLING THE BOTTOM IN TREASURIES IS HE\nTHINKS THAT THE FED IN PARTICULAR AND WORLDWIDE THERE\nIS NOW FINALLY QUESTIONING OF THE FRAMEWORK ABOUT LOW INTEREST\nRATES AND NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES IN JAPAN, THAT MAYBE THEY\nTHINK IT IS NOT WORKING. >> THIS ALL BEGAN THIS PERIOD OF\nEXTENDED VOLATILITY, EXTREME VOLATILITY, BEGAN WITH MARIO\nDRAGHI. NOT SAYING THAT HE WOULD GO\nFURTHER. AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I'VE\nBEEN ON FOR A VERY LONG TIME, THIS IDEA OF HOW DO YOU WEAKEN\nTHE BANKS WHO ARE YOUR MAJOR CONDUIT OF MONETARY POLICY.\nAND NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES DO THAT.\nAND THAT ANSWER HAS NEVER SUFFICIENTLY BEEN PROVIDED BY\nTHE PROPONENTS OF NEGATIVE RATES TO MY MIND.\n>> OR EXTREMELY LOW RATES CAUSE THAT KIND OF ISSUE, RIGHT?\n>> I THINK IN -- IN ZERO OR A SLIGHTLY POSITIVE ENVIRONMENT,\nTHE BANKS HAVE A WAY OF MAKING MONEY.\nWHEN THEY HAVE TO EVENTUALLY PASS ALONG THESE NEGATIVE RATES\nTO CLIENTS YOU GET TO A BIG PROBLEM.\n>> STEVE, STICK AROUND. WE BRING IN DIANE SWONK, FOUNDER\nAND CEO OF DS ECONOMICS. I ASSUME DS STANDS FOR DIANE\nSWONK. >> HOW IRONIC IS THAT?\n>> REALLY, REALLY -- YOU GET UP EARLY.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK OF WHAT STEVE JUST SAID AND WHAT WE HEARD AT\nDELIVERING ALPHA YESTERDAY, THE CONCERN WITH THE POSTURE OF THE\nFED AND CENTRAL BANKS GLOBALLY? >> I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS\nTHAT WE SAW, THE THEMES THAT CAME OUT AND I THINK STEVE ALSO\nALLUDED TO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAME UP IN BEN BERNANKE'S\nBLOG TODAY. I WOULD SAY IMPLICIT INCLUSION\nIS THAT, HEY, NEGATIVE RATES, RAISING THE INFLATION TARGET,\nALL THE STRETCHING THAT WE'RE SEEING CENTRAL BANKS DO WOULDN'T\nBE AS NECESSARY IF WE HAD FISCAL REFORMS, STRUCTURAL REFORMS, TAX\nREFORMS, FISCAL POLICY, THAT ACCOMPANIED AND HELPED LOW RATES\nEARLIER ON IN THE CYCLE. AND WE'RE SORT OF LATE TO THE\nGAME ON THAT. AUSTERITY TOOK, YOU KNOW, A\nHIGHER PRIORITY THAN IT SHOULD HAVE, EARLIER IN THE CYCLE.\nNOW WE'RE TO THE STAGE WHERE YOU'RE NOW HEARING PEOPLE\nTALKING ABOUT LOOSENING UP ON FISCAL POLICY WHEN WE HAVE A LOT\nOF DEBT IN THE WORLD AND IT DOES MAKE ME WORRIED ABOUT, YOU KNOW,\nCAN WE REALLY GET FISCAL REFORMS AND FISCAL POLICY WE NEED TO GET\nBETTER ECONOMIC GROWTH AND GET THE FED SIDELINED.\nI'M NOT SURE THAT CAN HAPPEN. >> STEVE?\n>> I DON'T THINK IT CAN EITHER. WHO KNOWS HOW THIS ELECTION\nCOMES OUT. BUT WHAT WE DO SEE AND I ASKED\nJACK LEW ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY, AN ATTEMPT TO PASS THE ONUS OF\nGROWTH, BATON OF THE ONUS OF GROWTH OVER TO THE FISCAL SIDE,\nAND THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH LIKE WE AIN'T TAKING IT.\nTHE PROBLEM WITH -- AND EVERYBODY ON THIS PANEL, WITH\nALL OF THIS STUFF THE FED HAS DONE, IS THAT THE FEAR OF TAKING\nOFF THE BANDAGE OR STOPPING THE MEDICATION HAS -- IS SEEN TO BE\nWORSE THAN THE ACTUAL MEDICATION ITSELF.\nAND NOBODY CAN STEP FORWARD AND SAY WITH ANY ASSURANCE THE\nUNWIND IS GOING TO BE OKAY. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS BANDAGE\nOFF AND UNDERNEATH THIS IS GOING TO BE A HEALED SCAR.\nNOBODY KNOWS WHAT IT IS GOING TO BE LIKE FOR THE FEDERAL RESERVE\nTO STOP -- TO START RAISING INTEREST RATES.\nNOBODY KNOWS WHAT IT IS GOING TO BE LIKE FOR THE FEDERAL RESERVE\nTO START REDUCING ITS BALANCE SHEET.\nTHERE IS NO PRECEDENT HERE. GUYS LIKE SINGER AND GUYS LIKE\nDALIO, THEY SIT THERE AND THEY WORRY ABOUT THE FUTURE.\nTHAT'S WHY SINGER SAYS YOU ARE WRONG TO SEE THE TEN-YEAR AS A\nRISK FREE ASSET. IT AIN'T.\n>> AND YOU'RE RIGHT AND -- HERE, DIANE, IS WHY IT -- THIS KIND OF\nLINE OF THINKING DOES FRUSTRATE ME BECAUSE GUYS LIKE DALIO, AND\nSINGER, THEY'RE PAID A LOAD, I'LL SAY, OF MONEY, TO FIGURE\nTHESE THINGS OUT. THAT'S BASICALLY THEIR ONLY JOB\nIS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN A FEW YEARS, AND\nMAKE INVESTMENTS THAT WILL PAY OFF FROM WHAT IS GOING TO\nHAPPEN. SAYING IT IS A WORRY, WE DON'T\nKNOW, WHATEVER. THEY'RE EITHER OBFUSCATING WHAT\nTHEY DO BELIEVE OR KNOW OR DON'T KNOW IN WHICH CASE WHY INVEST,\nSO THE IDEA IS -- A LOT OF TIMES WE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IS\nGOING TO HAPPEN. YOU STILL GOT TO DO WHAT MAY BE\nRIGHT AND LET THINGS FIGURE IT OUT.\n>> ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT IS CRITICAL, THIS IS ONE THAT STEVE\nIS ALLUDING TO AS WELL, THAT IS THE FED IS BEHIND A ROCK AND A\nHARD PLACE. LAEL BRAINARD HAS BEEN -- SOME\nSAY HEY, WE MADE IT THROUGH THE PERIOD, THE DOLLAR IS NOT\nDEPRECIATING. AND SHE ARGUES, THAT'S BECAUSE\nWE MOVED TO THE SIDELINES. THAT'S BECAUSE OTHER CENTRAL\nBANKS ACTUALLY DOUBLED DOWN AND EASED FURTHER AS WE SAW THE\nBREXIT SITUATION UNFOLD, AS WE SAW THE CHINA SITUATION UNFOLD\nAND SO THERE SAY REAL ISSUE ON CAUSE AND EFFECT AND A VICIOUS\nCYCLE OF IF YOU PULL OUT, DO YOU HAVE THE TAIL WAGGING THE DOG?\nTHE INTEREST RATE IS TELLING THE FED WHAT TO DO.\nON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT, WE CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE A VERY\nDISORDERLY UNWINDING OF FINANCIAL MARKETS EITHER.\n>> I THINK A LOT OF THE DISCUSSION TOO COMES FROM WHAT\nHAVE BEEN THE COSTS OF HAVING THESE LOW INTEREST RATE POLICIES\nIN TERMS OF THE WAY CAPITAL HAS BEEN DIRECTED TO DIFFERENT\nTHINGS. WE TALK ABOUT THAT ALL THE TIME.\nBUT LET ME MAKE ANOTHER POINT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE\nSUPPOSED TO HAPPEN, WE SAY THE FISCAL SIDE, THE FISCAL SIDE\nISN'T JUST ABOUT SPENDING MONEY. IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT\nCHANGING YOUR -- HOLD ON ONE SECOND, DIANE, CHANGING YOUR\nECONOMY SO ACTUALLY IT WILL WORK BETTER.\nTHE THIRD ARROW IN JAPAN, NEVER HAPPENED, RIGHT?\nNEVER EASED UP ON IMMIGRATION TO IMPROVE THE EMPLOYMENT PICTURE\nTHERE. >> AND NOT GOING TO.\n>> BY THE WAY, THIS MORNING, THE GREEK LABOR MINISTER SAYS THEY\nCANNOT IMPLEMENT LABOR REFORMS WITH THE IMF'S DEMANDS.\nNOTHING HAS CHANGED SINCE 2010 BECAUSE CENTRAL BANKS GAVE THESE\nGOVERNMENTS A PASS. >> CENTRAL BANKS DID THEIR JOBS.\nI THINK THE ELECTED OFFICIALS PUNTED.\n>> JUST LIKE -- >> NOT BECAUSE --\n>> THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO. >> NO, BUT THEY -- THAT'S NOT\nTRUE. >> BACK TO THE METAPHOR OF THE\nPERSON WHO BURNED THEIR HOUSE DOWN.\nFIRE DEPARTMENT ARRIVES AND SAYS, YOU SCREWED UP, WE'RE\nGOING TO LET IT BURN. >> WE DON'T KNOW THE HOUSE ISN'T\nBURNING DOWN RIGHT NOW. YOU DON'T KNOW THAT'S WHAT'S\nHAPPENING IN EUROPE AS THEY CONTINUALLY CONTRACT.\nYOU DON'T SEE BUSINESS EXPANSION.\n>> WE DO. IF YOU LOOK AT -- MICHELLE,\nLOOK -- >> HE SAYS WE DO.\n>> WE KNOW THAT TWO THINGS HAPPENED.\nWE KNOW THAT EUROPE IMPLEMENTED WHAT IS LARGELY THOUGHT TO BE\nERRANT AND PREMATURE AUSTERITY. AND IT DID NOT WORK OUT WELL.\n>> WITHOUT REFORMS. >> WE ALSO KNOW --\n>> MICHELLE, WAIT, YOU HAD YOUR LITTLE TIME ON THE SOAP BOX, I'M\nGOING TO GET MY LITTLE TIME HERE.\nAND NUMBER TWO, IT WAS VERY, VERY LATE IN IMPLEMENTING ZERO\nRATES OR QUANTITATIVE EASING. YOU LOOK AT THE PERFORMANCE OF\nTHE UNITED STATES VERSUS EUROPE AND MEANWHILE, JAPAN HAS BEEN ON\nAGAIN, OFF AGAIN FOR MANY YEARS AND DECADES, AND ITS PERFORMANCE\nLAGGED THE U.S. THE U.S. CAME FORWARD STRONGLY.\nBECAUSE IT ACTED EARLY AND STRONGLY, ITS RESULTS SHOW IT.\n>> WE'RE STILL LAGGING BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT DONE MORE.\nAT THE END OF THE DAY, THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS DOING WHAT IT\nMANDATED TO DO. THERE IS A LAW HERE AS WELL.\nTHAT'S SOMETHING WE SORT OF LOSE SIGHT OF, THE FED IS OPERATING\nWITHIN THE LAW, THE LAW MAY BE WRONG, THERE MAY BE REFORMS.\nI HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT OPENING THAT CAN OF WORMS AND WHERE IT\nGOES ON THE FED'S INDEPENDENCE. BUT THAT SAID, RIGHT NOW,\nTHEY'RE OPERATING WITHIN THE CONSTRUCT THEY HAVE.\nBY NOT -- THEY HAVE NOT BEEN TRYING TO SIT THERE AND ABLE\nFISCAL POLICY. IF YOU LOOK AT EVERY SPEECH BACK\nTO BERNANKE, THE 2002 SPEECH, WHERE BERNANKE OUTLINED WHAT\nWOULD HAPPEN IF WE GOT TO THIS POINT, FISCAL POLICY WAS\nCRITICAL AS A PARTNER. AND IT HAS NOT BEEN THERE\nCONSISTENTLY. >> THIS IS A WHOLE OTHER\nDISCUSSION, YOU BROUGHT UP, AT THE END HERE.\n>> I KNOW. I'M MICHELLE.\n>> WE'LL DO IT ANOTHER DAY. >> I'M SORRY.\n>> IT IS AN IMPORTANT DISCUSSION TO BE HAD, RIGHT?\n>> I WOULD LOVE -- FOR ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER SEGMENT.\nI WOULD LOVE TO KNOW WHERE FED FUND RATES WOULD BE IF WE HADN'T\nHAD THE FINANCIAL -- IF WE HADN'T HAD THE CRISIS AND\nREDUCED THEM TO ZERO, GIVEN THE SAME GDP GROWTH, JOB GROWTH,\nINFLATION, WHERE WOULD WE BE? 3%?\n>> WHERE WERE THEY BEFORE? >> 4%?\n>> NOW AT .25%. >> IN 2003.\n>> YOU GET MY POINT.",

MARIS, I'LL START WITH YOU. ONE OF THE FUNDS YOU RUN IS THE\nGLOBAL ALPHA EQUITY STRATEGY. SO YOU'RE COMMITTED TO\nDELIVERING ALPHA. PEOPLE SOUNDED FEARFUL YESTERDAY\nTHAT THE END OF THE CREDIT CYCLE WAS APPROACHING AN END.\nARE YOU AS WORRIED AS THEY ARE? >> YOU KNOW, I'M NOT REALLY.\nI THINK THERE IS A CROWDED TRADE THAT IS OUT THERE, IT IS IN THIS\nLOW VOLATILITY SAFETY TRADE AND YOU SEE AN INCREDIBLE RUSH OF\nCAPITAL TO THIS. AND WHAT THAT HAS MEANT IS THAT\nSTOCKS AREN'T BEING PRICED FOR GROWTH.\nYOU KNOW, THERE IS GROWTH, WHERE IT IS OPEN ENDED AND SECULAR.\nAT THE SAME TIME, YOU'VE GOT STOCKS THAT ARE REFLECTING\nDISTRESS ASSET PRICES. WHEN THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE\nDRAMATICALLY BETTER. FOR MY VIEW, WE'RE FINDING GREAT\nOPPORTUNITIES BOTH IN GREAT SECULAR GROWTH STORIES AROUND\nTHE WORLD, AS WELL AS REALLY INTERESTING DEEP VALUE STOCKS\nTHAT ARE -- WHERE THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY\nBETTER THAN THE SHARE PRICES REFLECT.\n>> BREXIT, NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES, POPULISM, THE RISE OF THE\nRIGHT WING, WE GOT ALL THESE THINGS, GEORGE THAT HAVE NEVER\nHAPPENED BEFORE. IS THERE ANY HISTORICAL GUIDE?\nCAN YOU LOOK BACK AT ANY TEXTBOOK AND SAY THIS IS WHAT I\nSHOULD DO NOW? >> NO.\nSO I THINK THAT'S WHAT HAS GOT EVERYONE SO UNEASY.\nALL OF THESE THINGS PUT US IN A PLACE WE HAVE NEVER BEEN BEFORE,\nTHAT'S WHAT CREATED THIS ANXIETY.\n>> HERE IS WHAT I FOUND INTERESTING, ESPECIALLY BILL\nMILLER SAID LONG THE S&P, SHORT THE TEN-YEAR TREASURY, HE SAID\nTHE TEN-YEAR WAS SO OVERVALUED, IT REMINDED HIM OF STOCKS IN\nSEPTEMBER OF 1987, JUST BEFORE THE CRASH.\nIT WAS THAT -- SO HUGE. HERE IS WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.\nIF YOU THINK BONDS ARE IN A BUBBLE, INTEREST RATES ARE GOING\nTO RISE. ISN'T THAT GOING TO BE BAD FOR\nSTOCKS. >> THAT'S THE HISTORICAL PLAY\nBOOK. IF WE WERE PLAYING OFF\nHISTORICAL PARADIGM, THAT'S WHAT WOULD HAPPEN.\nTHAT'S NOT THE CASE NOW. THE REASON RATES ARE SO LOW IS\nBECAUSE THERE ARE ALL THESE CONCERNS ABOUT NO GROWTH IN THE\nENVIRONMENT, NO INFLATION. IF WE GET RATES GOING UP, IT IS\nA SIGN OF GROWTH, A SIGN OF INFLATION.\nTHAT'S ACTUALLY VERY HEALTHY FOR EQUITIES.\n>> IF YOU LOOK, JACK, I'LL BRING YOU IN HERE ON THIS\nCONVERSATION, YOU KNOW, THIS NOTION THAT PEOPLE ARE LOOK FOR\nYIELD, RIGHT, THAT'S WHY PEOPLE WENT INTO DIVIDEND YIELDING\nSTOCKS, LOOK AT THE SECTORS IN THE S&P 500, EIGHT OF THE TEN\nARE YIELDING HIGHER THAN THE TEN-YEAR YIELD.\nSO WHEN YIELDS GO UP, THERE IS GOING TO BE THIS RUSH OF MONEY.\nGEORGE HAD MENTIONED THE LOW VOLATILITY FUNDS.\nTHOSE ARE THE FUNDS IN THIS PARTICULAR TRADE.\nAREN'T THINGS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THIS TIME IN TERMS OF WHAT HAS\nGOTTEN US HERE AS PEOPLE SEARCH FOR YIELD AND PUSH THE\nVALUATIONS HIGHER ON THESE SECTORS LIKE UTILITIES AND\nTELECOMS AND STAPLES? >> I THINK IT IS A CONSEQUENCE\nOF, YOU KNOW, WE HANDED OFF TO THE CENTRAL BANKS TO SAY, HERE,\nFIX IT, WE GOT LOW GROWTH AND WANT HIGHER GROWTH.\nAND, YOU KNOW, IN MANY RESPECTS, JUST LIKE PUTTING SAND IN THE\nSHORE AND GETTING STYMIED WHEN THE TIDE COMES BACK IN.\nI THINK WHAT IT HAS DONE HAS CERTAINLY CREATED A WEDGE\nBETWEEN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND THE -- AND MAINSTREAM.\nAND SO AS A RESULT OF THAT, INVESTORS ARE LOOKING FOR\nYIELD -- WILLING TO TAKE MORE RISKS THAT THEY'RE ACCUSTOMED TO\nTAKING. WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND, ANY\nCRISIS THAT RESULTS FROM THIS IS REALLY A CONTRIVED CRISIS.\nTHIS ISN'T A METEOR COMING OUT OF OUTER SPACE AND HITTING THE\nEARTH THAT WE CAN'T GET OUT IN FRONT OF.\nTHIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN CREATED BY THE CENTRAL BANKS AND\nWE HAVE TO WORK OUR WAY OUT. I DON'T THINK THIS IS\nNECESSARILY THE NEXT, YOU KNOW, CRISIS THAT IS GOING TO CREATE A\nHUGE CRATER. >> ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT I\nHEARD YESTERDAY AND I BELIEVE IT WAS PAUL SINGER WHO MADE IT AND\nALSO MR. DALIO WHO MADE IT AND THAT WAS THAT WHAT THE CENTRAL\nBANKS HAVE DONE IS TRY TO CREATE GROWTH BY KEEPING INTEREST RATES\nLOW. IT HASN'T WORKED OR ARGUABLE\nTHEY HAVE CREATED GROWTH. BUT IT IS NOT ARGUABLE THAT THEY\nHAVE NOT SUPPORTED THE PRICES OF ASSETS, BONDS AND STOCKS.\nAND IF THOSE -- IF THEY STOP DOING THAT, WHAT DOES THAT SAY\nABOUT THE VALUES OF STOCKS AND BONDS?\n>> PERFECT, I AGREE. STOCKS AND BONDS ARE EXPENSIVE.\nTHERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. THE FACT IS THAT McDONALD'S WAS\nABLE TO ISSUE A TEN-YEAR NOTE IN EUROPE AT 0.75% A FEW MONTHS\nAGO. I CAN ASSURE YOU, NO -- GIVEN\nTHAT McDONALD'S BONDS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE TRADING AT NEARLY 3%\nFOR THE SAME MATURITY, WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO BUY A McDONALD'S\nBOND AT 0.75%, BECAUSE THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK IS BUYING\nIT ALL. INVESTORS AREN'T BUYING THAT.\nAND McDONALD'S IS TAKING THAT MONEY BACK HERE AND BUYING BACK\nTHEIR OWN SHARES. SO THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT\nCENTRAL BANKS RUNNING INTERFERENCE AND CREATING HIGH VALUATIONS, BUT THE FACT IS,\nTHEY'RE NOT GOING TO NECESSARILY TURN OFF THE SPIGOT AND RUN\nAWAY. THEY RECOGNIZE THAT, YOU KNOW,\nTHERE IS AN ADDICTION HERE, AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SLOWLY\nGET OFF OF THIS LIQUIDITY, BUT DO IT IN A GRADUAL WAY.\n>> MICHELLE HAD MENTIONED GOING LONG STOCKS, AND SHORT G-7\nBONDS, BUT WHEN THIS -- WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT STOPS, WHEN\nTHE MERRY-GO-ROUND STOPS, WON'T ALL ASSET CLASSES GO DOWN?\nTHERE IS A BANK OF AMERICA, MERRILL LYNCH FUND SURVEY\nRELEASED YESTERDAY, 54% OF FUND MANAGERS SAY BOTH STOCKS AND\nBONDS ARE OVERVALUED AT THIS POINT.\nAND WE'RE JUST LAYING OUT, YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE LOW\nVOLATILITY FUNDS, PUSHING UP THE VALUATIONS.\nTHERE IS THIS THOUGHT THERE IS NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE ESSENTIALLY\nPUSHING THAT TRADE HIGHER. HOW IS IT GOING TO END?\nARE WE GOING TO SEE A REVERSION WHERE WE HAVE THAT BREAK IN\nCORRELATION? >> I THINK YOU CAN HAVE, YOU\nKNOW, SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN FIXED INCOME MARKETS AND EQUITY\nMARKETS AND HAVE EQUITY SECTORS DO VERY WELL.\nYOU HARKEN BACK TO THE YEAR 2000, WHEN THE MARKETS WERE TO\nBE KIND A DISASTER, FINANCIALS WERE UP 50% THAT YEAR.\nSO YOU CAN HAVE SECTORS THAT HAVE BEEN OVERSOLD OR\nUNDERAPPRECIATED DO EXTREMELY WELL IN A DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT.\nYOU TALK ABOUT EQUITY MARKETS OVERVALUED, 17 TIMES EARNINGS\nFOR THE S&P 500, HISTORICALLY THAT'S VERY, VERY HIGH.\nIT IS NOT HIGH RELATIVE TO FIXED INCOME AT THIS CURRENT TIME.\nAND AT THE SAME TOKEN, THERE IS SECTORS WITHIN THE S&P 500 THAT\nARE EXTRAORDINARILY CHEAP. YOU CAN LOOK AT FINANCIALS THAT\nARE TRADING DISTRESS BUT AREN'T. OR LOOK AT CHINESE INTERNET\nPLAYS. ALIBABA TRADES AT THE SAME\nMULTIPLE AS THE REGULATED U.S. UTILITY, THAT DOESN'T MAKE\nSENSE. SO YOU CAN SEE THIS UNWIND OF\nTHE SAFETY, THIS LOW VOLATILITY TRADE, CREATING TREMENDOUS\nOPPORTUNITIES IF YOU'RE ACTIVE. >> JAY JACK, YESTERDAY, MAY NOT\nHAVE SEEMED LIKE SOME SORT OF A RED LETTER DAY, BUT TO ME AND\nSOME OTHERS, VERY INTERESTING MOVES BECAUSE IT DOESN'T GET A\nLOT OF ATTENTION, NOT SEXY, DOESN'T SCREAM AT YOU, THE\nTEN-YEAR YIELD ROSE BY 3%, THE S&P FELL BY 1%, A VERY RARE DIVERSION.\nDID YESTERDAY ESTABLISH SOMETHING NEW?\n>> I DO THINK THAT FAIR VALUE FOR THE TEN-YEAR TREASURY IS\nHIGHER IN YIELD THAN WHERE IT IS RIGHT NOW.\nIF YOU LOOK AT NOMINAL GDP, WHICH IS RELATIVELY LOW, THAT'S\nAT 2.7%, NOT 1.7%. THAT'S HISTORICALLY BEEN A\nPRETTY GOOD PROXY FOR WHERE THE TEN-YEAR TREASURY OUGHT TO BE.\nSO, YEAH, I WOULD SAY WE COULD GET 100 BASIS POINT RISE OUT OF\nTHE TEN-YEAR TREASURY AND THAT IT WILL CERTAINLY CREATE SOME\nDISRUPTION. BUT, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT\nSUGGESTING THAT -- OR I DON'T THINK ANYONE IS SUGGESTING THAT\nFAIR VALUE FOR THE TEN-YEAR IS 3.5% OR 4% OR SOMETHING LIKE\nTHAT. >> GEORGE MARIS, JACK, THANK YOU\nBOTH VERY MUCH. APPRECIATE IT.\n>> PLEASURE, THANKS. >> IF YOU ARE IN PITTSBURGH AND\nYOU HAIL AN UBER TODAY, IT COULD ARRIVE WITHOUT A DRIVER.\nTHE QUESTION IS, WOULD YOU STILL GET IN?\nTHE COMPANY TESTING OUT ITS AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE PROGRAM.\nWE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE DETAILS. >>> AND MAKING THE CASE TO BUY\nVALEANT STOCK, A BOLD CALL FROM ONE OF THE MOST LEGENDARY STOCK\nINVESTORS.",

WHEN YOU REALLY LOOK AT THIS\nTHING, LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE WITH THE RATES.\nTHIS QUARTER POINT, LIKE YOU SAY, WE'RE AT RECORD LOWS.\nWE GO A QUARTER POINT. IF THAT REALLY IS GOING TO MESS\nUP THE MARKET AND GET US TO GET SOME SORT OF AN 8% SELL-OFF OR\nSOME CRAZY THING, THEN I THINK IT WILL CREATE SOME\nOPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE AN OVERREACTION OF THE\nMARKETS ONCE AGAIN. LISTENING TO EVERYBODY YESTERDAY\nAT DELIVERING ALPHA, IT'S BASICALLY AN INSIDE OF WHAT IT\nLOOKS LIKE AT THE FED, RIGHT? YOU HAVE GUYS WHO WANT TO RAISE.\nYOU HAVE GUYS WHO DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD RAISE, AND EVERYBODY\nHAS THEIR OPINION, AND THEY'VE GOT GOOD STRONG ARGUMENTS.\nTO YOUR POINT, STEVEN, I DON'T THINK IT ROCKS THE BOAT AS MUCH\nAS PEOPLE EXPECT. >> LOOK AT IT THIS WAY.\nWE'RE NOT AT CRISIS LIVES IN THE ECONOMY ANYMORE.\nLOOK AT HOW FAR EMPLOYMENT HAS GONE.\nTO THINK THAT YOU STILL NEED CRISIS LEVEL RATES, I THINK, IS\nRIDICULOUS.

IF YOU GO BACK TO WHAT IS GOING\nON IN THE MARKETS, IF YOU GO BACK TO WHAT HE DID WITH CONSECO\nAND IRWIN JACOBS WHERE HE WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE AND ALLEGEDLY HAD\nA 22% SHORT INTEREST, IN 2000, 2001, AND IT WAS MENTIONED BY\nACKMAN WHEN YOU DID THAT FAMOUS THING ON JANUARY 25th.\nHE IS ON THE OTHER SIDE. HE DID WHAT HE SAID NO\nPROFESSIONAL WOULD DO. HE HAD A SIMILAR SIZE SHORT\nINTEREST IN A COMPANY, AND JACOBS WAS SQUEEZING HIM.\nCONSECO WENT BROUGHT, AND IT WORKED OUT.\nIT'S A GREAT WAY TO SQUEEZE THE SHORTS.\n>> IT WAS PROVOCATIVE ICAHN, AS USUAL.\n>>> APPLE SOARING SINCE MONDAY. UP ALMOST 10%, AS WE SAID, AND\nJOHN IS TRACKING SOME UNUSUAL OPTIONS ACTIVITY IN A STOCK\nTHAT'S BENEFITTING FROM THAT JUMP.\nFIRST, MICHELLE KA RUSSO CABRERA HAS A LOOK ON WHAT'S COMING UP.\n>> COMING UP AT THE TOP OF THE HOUR ON \"POWER LUNCH\" DELIVERING\nALPHA DELIVERED A LOT OF FEAR. MANY OF THE WORLD'S TOP\nINVESTORS RINGING THE ALARM BELLS.\nARE THINGS REALLY THAT BAD? TWO BIG REASONS WHY TIM COOK IS\nLITERALLY DANCING TODAY. AND THE RICH CLOSING THEIR WALLETS.\nWHAT IT MEANS TO THE ECONOMY AND HIGH-END LUXURY.\nPOWER AT THE TOP OF THE HOUR. >> THE HALFTIME REPORT WITH\nSCOTT WAPNER IS THE PLACE FOR MARKET MOVING INTERVIEWS.\n>> YOU DON'T CALL A COMPANY A SEWER BECAUSE THE COMPANY MADE A\nMISTAKE. >> REAL MONEY. >>> BACK ON THE HALFTIME REPORT.\nWE'LL AT THE TELESTRATOR FOR THE OPTIONS MARKET.\nWHAT DO YOU SEE? >> TAKE A LOOK AT THIS ONE.\nIT PAINS ME TO SAY IT BECAUSE JIM HAS IT IN HIS HALFTIME PORTFOLIO.\n>> GOOD FOR YOU, JIM. >> I SEE UNUSUAL ACTIVITY AT THE\n60 STRIKE IN OCTOBER. THE STOCK HAS BEEN MOVING LIKE\nTHIS. IT'S BEEN MOVING LIKE THAT\nBECAUSE OF AT LEAST SOME BECAUSE OF APPLE AND WITH THIS GOOD NEWS\nFROM APPLE, TAKE A LOOK AT THESE CALLS THEY'RE BUYING.\nTHEY'RE BUYING THE 60 CALLED IN OCTOBER.\nTHOSE ARE $5 OUT OF THE MONEY. THEY'VE ALREADY MOVED UP FROM\nYESTERDAY RIGHT AROUND THAT 55 IT WAS SHORTER TERM.\nTHESE ARE OUT TO OCTOBER. THE OTHERS WERE SEPTEMBER 23rd.\n>> YOU STILL LIKE THE METALS, THE MINERS, GOLD MINERS, THINGS\nLIKE THAT. >> I'M HOLDING ON TO GLD, AND I\nALSO HAD A PREVIOUS SLV. I ADDED SLW, SILVER WHEATON\nTODAY AS WELL. BECAUSE I JUST SOLD OUT OF IT\nLAST WEEK, HAD SOME GOOD PROFITS.\nI THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE MORE COMING.\nI WANT TO GET BACK IN. I'M IN BOTH.\nYES, SILVER AND GOLD. >> THE BROTHERS NEGARIAN WITH\nUNUSUAL ACTIVITY. WE'LL STICK WITH COMMODITIES,\nTHOUGH. COPPER SURGING TO A THREE-WEEK\nHIGH TODAY.
