AND THIS YEAR IT IS ESPECIALLY\nTRICKY BECAUSE OF THE DONALD TRUMP FACTOR.\nOBVIOUSLY A MODERATOR LIKE MEGYN KILLY WOULD BE A NON-STARTER FOR\nDONALD TRUMP. SO THE COMMISSION IS HAVING A\nVERY HARD TIME GETTING TO A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN ACTUALLY\nCONFIRM THE FOUR MODERATORS. I THINK AFTER LABOR DAY WE'LL\nHEAR THE NAMES. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF\nJOURNALISTS WHO ARE ACCEPTABLE TO BOTH SIDES.\nBUT IT'S AWFULLY TRICKY THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF TRUMP.\n>> FRANK, WHAT IS THE JOB DESCRIPTION?\n>> WELL, THIS YEAR THE JOB DESCRIPTION IS TO BE BOTH A\nJOURNALIST, MODERATOR AND A CIRCUS NAVIGATOR, I THINK.\nTHE JOB INVOLVES DOING MANY THINGS, WHICH IS WHY THIS IS SO\nDIFFICULT. YOU HAVE TO ASK GOOD QUESTIONS,\nLISTEN FAST AND HARD, YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING\nABOUT TO REFER TO INFORMATION. WE HOPE THERE'S ACTUALLY GOING\nTO BE SUBSTANCE IN THESE DEBATES.\nA GOOD MODERATOR GETS THE CANDIDATES TO ENGAGE WITH ONE\nANOTHER, IT IS NOT JUST SORT OF PARALLEL NEWS CONFERENCES OR\nSOUNDBITES GENERATED. THIS YEAR THE MODERATOR HAS TO\nBE A REALITY SHOW HOST. THEY HAVE TO KNOW THAT 60\nMILLION, 70 MILLION AROUND THE WORLD ARE WATCHING THIS THING,\nMAYBE A BILLION PEOPLE.

HE'S NOT AN OPTION.\nTHERE ARE MANY PEOPLE AT ABC AND CNN AND OTHER NETWORKS THAT ARE\nOPTIONS. LOOK AT ANDERSON COOPER HAVING\nTRUMP AND CLINTON BACK-TO-BACK ON CONSECUTIVE NIGHTS.\nLESTER HOLT AT NBC.

AND THEY SHOULDN'T ONLY BE\nLOOKING AT JOURNALISTS AND I KNOW THEY ARE NOT.\nAND IN JUST A BRIEF MOMENT I'M GOING TO DISAGREE WITH MY GOOD\nFRIEND BRIAN STELTER ON THIS. THERE IS SO MUCH THAT YOU'RE\nDEALING WITH OUT THERE. YOU'VE GOT CAMERAS, YOU'VE GOT\nCLOCKS, YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE TALKING TO YOU IN YOUR EARS, TWO\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WHO IS ARE LOUD AND MAYBE ANGRY AND\nMAYBE ENGAGING ONE ANOTHER. JUGGLING ALL OF THAT IS HARD TO\nDO IF THIS IS THE FIRST TIME YOU'RE STEPPING IN FRONT OF A\nCAMERA OR A CROWD LIKE THIS. I CAN G A GREAT PROFESSOR AND\nTALK TO 250 PEOPLE IN A LECTURE HALL AND BE A PRESIDENTIAL\nHISTORIAN. CAN I MANAGE THAT KIND OF\nREALTIME JUGGLING? MAYBE THE ANSWER IS YES.\nBRIAN, THE ONE THING I WOULD SAY ABOUT RACHEL MADDOW AND THE\nOTHERS, THAT WOULD BE A DREAM SCENARIO IN ONE WAY, BUT THE\nOTHER THING VERY IMPORTANT AND THE COMMISSION SHOULD BE\nTHINKING ABOUT, AND THE PUBLIC SHOULD, THE MODERATORS SHOULD\nNOT BE SUCH OVERARCHING CHARACTERS THEMSELVES TO\nOVERSHADOW THE CANDIDATES. THEY SHOULD BE THERE TO ASK THE\nQUESTIONS, GET THE CANDIDATES TO ENGAGE AND STEP BACK TO LET IT\nHAPPEN. SO MAYBE, GOD FORBID, THE PUBLIC\nACTUALLY SEES AN ENGAGEMENT OF THE TWO CANDIDATES AND GETS A\nLITTLE BIT OF LIGHT WITH ALL OF THE HEAT THAT WE HAVE BEEN\nSEEING SO FAR. >> I MOSTLY -- EVEN IF THE\nMODERATORS TRY NOT TO BE PLAYERS ON STAGE, THEY ARE PLAYERS\nBECAUSE IT IS ALL ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE, HAVING TO BE ABLE\nTO MANAGE THE TELEVISION STAGE BEING SET UP.\nIN SOME WAYS THESE DEBATES ARE SO ARTIFICIAL.\nSO YOU NEED THE MODERATOR AND TELEVISION EXPERTISE, DECADES OF\nIT IN ORDER TO KNOW HOW TO MANAGE IT.\nTHAT MAKES SENSE. >> IT DOES.\nAND THIS YEAR IT WILL BE MORE SO AS HE BRINGS SHOWMANSHIP TO IT.\nWHEN DO YOU STEP IN AND INTERRUPT?\nWHEN DO YOU STOP? WHEN IS THAT APPROPRIATE?\nWHEN IS IT DISRESPECTFUL? THAT'S A JUGGLE, THAT'S HARD.\n>> THIS YEAR THEY HAVE TO BE MORE ASSERTIVE.\nTHEY SHOULD NOT GET IN THE WAY, BUT WE'LL NEED THE REALTIME\nFACT-CHECKING IF CANDIDATES SAY THE THINGS THEY HAVE BEEN SAYING\nSON STAGE AND AT TWITTER AND RALLIES.\n>> FRANK, I ASKED YOU FOR SOMEONE WITH EXPERIENCE BECAUSE\nTHIS IS NO EASY TASK. IT WOULD SEEM BY DEFINITION THAT\nWOULD PRECLUDE A NUMBER OF MILLENIALS.\nI KNOW ONLINE THERE'S A LOT OF CHATTER AMONG VOTER WHO IS SAY,\nHEY, I HOPE IT IS SOMEONE REPRESENTATIVE OF OUR\nGENERATION. BUT FRANK, TO YOUR POINT, IF IT\nIS, IT WILL BE A FIRST GO-AROUND FOR SOMEBODY.\n>> YEAH, AND THAT IS TOUGH. AGAIN, YOU KNOW, IT IS VERY\nINTIMIDATED. I HAVE INTERVIEWED PRESIDENTS OF\nTHE UNITED STATES WITH LOTS OF YEARS OF EXPERIENCE.\nIT DOESN'T MEAN WHEN YOU WALK IN THE ROOM THAT IS -- THAT IS A\nSCARY THING A LITTLE BIT. FROM THIS BOOK I'M WORKING ON, I\nINTERVIEWED BOB SCHAEFFER BEFORE THE DEBATES.\nHERE'S A GUY WITH YEARS AND YEARS IN FRONT OF A CAMERA\nINTERVIEWING PRESIDENTS AND SENATORS AND DOING A WEEKLY TALK\nSHOW. SO YOU FEEL THE BURDEN THERE.\nI THINK THE POINT YOU MENTIONED, THOUGH, IS VERY IMPORTANT ABOUT\nMILLENNIALS AND OTHERS, ONE THING THE COMMISSION ABSOLUTELY\nNEEDS TO DO IS MAKE SURE THERE IS DIVERSITY AMONG THE\nMODERATORS. IT CAN'T BE A BUNCH OF OLD WHITE\nGUYS, SORRY TO THE WHITE GUYS, THAT'S NOT THE COUNTRY OR WHERE\nTHE DEBATE IS GOING OR COMING FROM.\n>> I DID ASK JORGE RAMOS -- SORRY, I MENTIONED JORGE RAMOS\nAND HE SAID HE PROBABLY KNOWS HE'S NOT IN CONTENTION BECAUSE\nOF THE BATTLES WITH DONALD TRUMP, BUT HE WANTS THE SEE A\nHISPANIC ANCHORMAN ON THE STAGE. >> BRIAN STELTER, BEFORE YOU\nLEAVE ME, GIVE ME A NAME, SOMEONE ON THE STAGE IN ONE OF\nTHE DEBATES. >> WELL, I THINK DIVERSITY IS\nCRUCIAL. THEY ARE GOING TO LOOK FOR\nSOMEONE AS LESTER HOLT OR MARTHA R\nRADDICK. ANDERSON COOPER COULD BE IN THE\nMIX. BUT THE COMMISSION DOESN'T KNOW\nYET. >> THOSE ARE EXACTLY THE NAMES I\nWOULD GIVE YOU. >> OH, REALLY?\n>> YEP, THOSE ARE VERY LIKELY NAMES AND THOSE ARE ALMOST\nCERTAINLY THE FINALISTS AMONG THOSE THAT THE COMMISSION IS\nCONSIDERING. >> ALL RIGHT.\nI'M THROWING WOLF INTO THE LIST.

HE OWNS THE ISSUE COMPARED TO\nHILLARY. >> JUST SO I GET IT, SO YOUR\nLISTENERS, SOME OF THEM ARE VOICING SOME CONCERN BECAUSE\nLIKE DENNIS, THEY ARE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.\nTHEY UNDERSTAND HE'S AT LEAST CLOSE ENOUGH TO THEIR SIDE THAT\nIT'S GOING TO STICK, CORRECT? THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?\n>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. LISTEN TO THE CROWD WHEN HE WAS\nTALKING. LISTEN TO THE APPLAUSE OF THE\nPEOPLE EXCITED. >> TO CHRIS NOW.\nTHE SURROGATES SEEM CLEAR ON THE POLICY.\nWHAT ABOUT YOUR LISTENERS? HOW DO THEY SEE IT?\n>> I AGREE WITH THE GENTLEMEN. THERE'S NOTHING -- WHERE WILL\nTHEY GO? WHAT IS YOUR OPTION?\nIF YOU INTEND TO VOTE FOR PRESIDENT AND YOU ARE NOT A\nHILLARY CLINTON SUPPORTER, WHERE DO YOU GO.\nWHAT I WISH DEEPLY WISH IS THAT DONALD TRUMP COULD HAVE STAYED\nFOCUSED ON WHAT WAS A REALLY GREAT WEEK LAST WEEK AND REALLY\nTHE EARLY PART OF THIS WEEK. FOCUS ON HER.\nHERE WE ARE BACK TO PARSING AND SLICING AND DICING WORDS HE SAID\nON ANY GIVEN DAY. IF ONLY HE COULD JUST DRIVE HOME\nTHE PROBLEMS WITH HER AND STAY OFF OF ANYTHING ELSE RELATED TO\nTHE CAMPAIGN, IT'S A WINNER. BUT I CANNOT FIGURE OUT THE\nLOGIC IN TURNING OVER THIS OPINION POLLING SESSION ON A\nHANNITY SHOW ON A RANDOM WEDNESDAY NIGHT.\nI DON'T GET IT. I DON'T KNOW WHY HE KEEPS DOING\nTHIS. >> YOU AND I HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT\nTHIS BEFORE ABOUT HE CAN'T SEEM TO HELP HIMSELF WITH STEPPING ON\nSOME OF HIS OWN MESSAGE AND YOU KNOW, RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, THE\nPOLITICAL GODS KIND OF SMILED ON HIM THIS WEEK WITH THE E-MAILS\nAND WITH THE CLINTON FOUNDATION AND INSTEAD, NOW THIS HAPPENED\nWITH IMMIGRATION AND ALSO THE BIGOT THING.\nMAYBE CHRIS HAS A POINT HERE. >> WELL, THERE IS A POINT THERE.\nBUT THERE'S A CHICKEN AND AN EGG ISSUE.\nWHO CAME FIRST, DID THE PRESS START PUSHING HIM ON OTHER\nISSUES BECAUSE THE PRESS HAS PRETTY MUCH ACKNOWLEDGED IT\nWANTS HILLARY CLINTON AS PRESIDENT.\nTHE \"NEW YORK TIMES,\" ONE OF ITS CHIEF WRITERS HAS ACTUALLY\nACKNOWLEDGED IT, SAID IT'S ACTUALLY IMMORAL FOR US TO TRY\nTO COVER BOTH OF THESE PEOPLE IMPARTIALLY BECAUSE MORALLY WE\nWANT HILLARY CLINTON TO WIN. >> THE PRESS DIDN'T MAKE HIM SAY\nIT. THAT WAS IN THE TELEPROMPTER.\nBIGOT WAS IN THE TELEPROMPTER. >> OH, NO, I WAS RESPONDING TO\nTHE IMMIGRATION ISSUE. THE BIGOT ISSUE, LOOK, THE BIGOT\nISSUE -- >>  THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE, HE\nSAID THAT ON HIS OWN. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT.\n>> YES. OKAY.\nSO IF HE RAISED IT ON HIS OWN, THEN IT IS BECAUSE HE NEEDS TO\nPIVOT MORE TO THE CENTER TO WIN A NATIONAL ELECTION.\nEVERY CANDIDATE DOES THAT EXCEPT IRONICALLY, HILLARY CLINTON, WHO\nHAS PIVOTED ONLY TO THE LEFT AND STILL FEELS SHE CAN WIN WHICH\nMIGHT BE TRUE BECAUSE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE MOVED TO THE LEFT.\n>> MY POINT IS, I THINK CHRIS' POINT IS THAT HE POSTPONED THIS\nIMMIGRATION, THE SPEECH ON IMMIGRATION SO THAT ONE WOULD\nTHINK HE COULD CAPITALIZE ON A BAD NEWS WEEK FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON BUT YET AND STILL, HE WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT\nIMMIGRATION IN A WAY THAT DIDN'T SEEM TO SUCCEED.\nAM I WRONG WITH THAT, CHRIS? >> WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A WOMAN\nWHO WAS UNDER FEDERAL INVESTIGATION BEFORE SHE GOT HER\nPARTY'S NOMINATION. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A MORE\nBEATABLE DEMOCRAT IN HISTORY. THERE'S NOTHING ELSE FOR HIM TO\nTALK ABOUT BUT HER. JUST STAY ON HER AND YOU STAND A\nREAL SHOT AT WINNING THIS THING RUNNING AWAY.\n>> ALL RIGHT. WE'LL BE BACK.\nWE'LL CONTINUE.",

BUT WHAT I THINK IS REALLY\nSIGNIFICANT THIS WEEK HILLARY BY HER CALLING HIM A RACIST AND\nTHEREFORE KIND OF EMBARRASSING, IF YOU'RE A TRUMP SUPPORTER,\nYOU'RE A RACIST. SHE'S ENSURED THAT PEOPLE DON'T\nWANT TO ARGUE ABOUT IT, THEY DON'T WANT TO BE CALLED A\nRACIST.

BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR ELECTION,\nDO YOU THINK, ANY OF YOU, THAT DONALD TRUMP, HAS HE DONE\nANYTHING TO DESERVE ANY OF THAT? IS HE TRAFFICKING AT ALL IN --\n>> IF I MAY JUST COMMENT ON ONE AND YOU KNOW I'LL BE BRIEF\nBECAUSE I ALWAYS CHERISH THE OTHER PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO SPEAK,\nBUT I'M A JEW AND I WROTE A BOOK ON ANTI-SEMITISM, WHICH IS\nEXTREMELY HIGHLY REGARDED. THIS NOTION THAT THE SIX-POINTED\nSTAR WAS ANTI-SEMITIC, THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF JUST OVER-THE-TOP\nFOOLISHNESS. WHAT IT DOES IS IT CHEAPENS REAL\nANTI-SEMITISM. A MAN THAT HAS A JEWISH\nDAUGHTER, ORTHODOX JEWISH SON-IN-LAW, ORTHODOX JEWISH\nCHILDREN, HIS OTHER SON IS DATING A JEW, THAT HE'S\nANTI-SEMITIC IS BIZARRE. >> I'LL GIVE YOU THE LAST WORD.\n>> TO DENNIS' POINT, IF WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT GUILT BY\nASSOCIATION, LET'S LOOK AT THE MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS OF\nDOLLARS THAT MRS.

SOMEHOW WORD GOT TO HIM THAT A\nSTATE LAWMAKER CALLED HIM A RACIST.\nTHE LAWMAKER DENIES DO THAT I THINK.\nBUT HERE'S THE VOICE MAIL THE GOVERNOR LEFT FOR HIM.\n>> THIS IS GOVERNOR PAUL RICHARD LePAGE.\nI WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT MY\nBEING A RACIST, YOU [ BLEEP ].

KU KLUX KLAN VALUES, DAVID DUKE\nVALUES, DONALD TRUMP VALUES ARE NOT AMERICAN VALUES.\n>> THIS IS SHAPING UP TO BE ONE OF THE NASTIEST ELECTIONS IN\nAMERICAN HISTORY, AND THAT IS SAYING SOMETHING.\nGARY TUCHMAN LOOKS BACK. >> HYPOCRITE, GODLESS ATHEIST.\nWHO SAID IT? TRUMP OR CLINTON?\nNEITHER. IT WAS ASSOCIATES OF JEFFERSON\nAND ADAMS TRADING BARBS. THOMAS JEFFERSON AND JOHN ADAMS.\n>> A MAN YOU CAN BAIT WITH A TWEET.\n>> LYIN', CROOKED HILLARY. >> Reporter: THE FACT IS ALL\nTHIS NAME-CALLING AND DIRTY CAMPAIGNING IS NOTHING NEW.\nTAKE THE ELECTION OF 1828. JOHN QUINCY ADAMS VERSUS ANDREW\nJACKSON IN ANOTHER POLITICAL BROUHAHA.\nADAMS TAKING AIM AT JACKSON, ASSERTING THAT JACKSON DIDN'T\nKNOW HOW TO SPELL, WAS TOO UNEDUCATED TO BECOME PRESIDENT,\nWHILE NEWSPAPERS PORTRAYED HIS WIFE, RACHEL, AS A SHORT, FAT\nDUMPLING. JACKSON SHOT BACK, CLAIMING THAT\nADAMS HAD SOLD HIS WIFE'S MAID AS A CONCUBINE TO THE CZAR OF\nRUSSIA. AND DOUGLAS ACCUSING LINCOLN OF\nHYPOCRISY ON THE ISSUE OF TEMPERANCE, CLAIMING THAT\nLINCOLN HIMSELF HAD ONCE OPERATED A GROCERY STORE THAT\nSOLD HARD LIQUOR, CAUSING QUITE THE STIR.\nLINCOLN'S REPLY, IF THAT WAS THE CASE, THEN SURELY DOUGLAS WAS\nHIS BEST CUSTOMER. IN THE ELECTION OF 1912,\nTHEODORE ROOSEVELT CALLED HIS OPPONENT, WILLIAM HOWARD TAFT A\nFATHEAD WITH THE BRAINS OF A GUINEA PIG.\nTAFT IN KIND CALLING ROOSEVELT'S FOLLOWERS NEUROTICS.\nMODERN CAMPAIGNS HAVE SEEN THEIR SHARE FAIR OF NASTINESS, TOO.\n1972, EDWARD MUSKOGEE OF MAIN. ONE ARTICLE PLANTED BY THE NIXON\nWHITE HOUSE, ACCUSED MUSKOGEE OF USING RACIAL SLURS AGAINST\nFRENCH AMERICANS. THE SECOND IMPLYING MUSKOGEE'S\nWIFE ENJOYED SMOKING, DRINKING, AND CURSING IN AN UNLADYLIKE\nWAY. >> BY ATTACKING ME, BY ATTACKING\nMY WIFE, HE HAS PROVED HIMSELF TO BE A GUTLESS COWARD.\n>> Reporter: BUT IT WAS ALSO REPORTED AT THE TIME MUSKOGEE\nBROKE DOWN AND CRIED, SENDING A MESSAGE THAT HE COULDN'T HANDLE\nTHE HEAT, AND SENDING HIS CAMPAIGN INTO A TAILSPIN.\nIN 1988, GEORGE H.W. BUSH LET LOOSE ON MIKE DUKAKIS.\n>> MICHAEL DUKAKIS HAS OPPOSED VIRTUALLY EVERY DEFENSE SYSTEM\nWE'VE DEVELOPED. >> Reporter: ASSERTING HE DIDN'T\nSUPPORT THE MILITARY, AND STATING THAT DUKAKIS THOUGHT A\nNAVAL EXERCISE IS SOMETHING YOU FIND IN JANE FONDA'S EXERCISE\nBOOKS. BUSH WENT ON TO WIN.\nAND IN 2000 GEORGE W. BUSH'S CAMPAIGN WAS ACCUSED OF STARTING\nA WHISPER CAMPAIGN, THAT HIS PRIMARY COMPONENT, JOHN McCAIN,\nHAD FATHERED AN ILLEGITIMATE BLACK CHILD.\nHIS DAUGHTER, BRIDGETTE, WAS ACTUALLY ADOPTED FROM\nBANGLADESH. BUT THE FALSE RUMOR HAD ITS\nINTENDED EFFECT, STALLING McCAIN'S MOMENTUM AND BUSH WENT\nON TO WIN. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOW EVEN\nTHOUGH IT'S UGHLY -- >> HILLARY CLINTON IS A BIGOT!\n>> THIS IS SOMEONE WHO RETWEETS WHITE SUPREMACISTS ONLINE.\n>> Reporter: -- IT CAN WORK. GARY TUCHMAN, CNN, ATLANTA.\n>> JOINING ME NOW, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST AND \"USA TODAY\"\nCOLUMNIST, KIRSTIN POWERS. SO WE HEARD HILLARY CLINTON\nACCUSE DONALD TRUMP OF TAKING HATE GROUPS MAINSTREAM, WE HEARD\nTRUMP ACCUSE HILLARY CLINTON OF BEING A BIGOT.\nAT THE END OF THE DAY, DOES EITHER WIN OR DOES ONE JUST LOSE\nLESS? >> THE THING IS, I WOULD SAY\nTHEY'RE KIND OF FALSE EQUIVALENCIES TO PUT WHAT\nHILLARY CLINTON DID IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS WHAT DONALD TRUMP\nDID. WE JUST WATCHED HIM YELLING THAT\nSHE'S A BIGOT. HE REALLY DOESN'T OFFER ANY\nEVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THIS. WHAT HILLARY CLINTON DID WAS SHE\nGAVE A SPEECH THAT SHE OUTLINED THINGS THAT DONALD TRUMP HAD\nSAID. IT WASN'T A MATTER OF OPINION,\nEVEN WHAT YOU JUST PLAYED WAS HER BASICALLY SAYING, THESE ARE\nTHINGS THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS SAID.\nTHESE ARE PEOPLE THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS HAD RELATIONSHIPS\nWITH. AND THERE'S NOTHING PARTICULARLY\nUGLY ABOUT THAT. I THINK SHE'S SORT OF\nPROSECUTING A CASE AGAINST HIM AND HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE\nALT-RIGHT. >> IT'S ALSO INTERESTING, WHEN\nYOU THINK THAT -- AND IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, DONALD TRUMP\nWAS LABELLED A RACIST BY HILLARY CLINTON, NO ONE IN THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY'S LEADERSHIP, OR EVEN HIS RUNNING MATE, ARE\nPUBLICLY DEFENDING HIM, AT LEAST THAT I'VE SEEN.\n>> WELL, THEY'RE NOT ONLY NOT DEFENDING HIM, I THINK IF YOU\nREMEMBER OTHER TIMES WHEN HE HAS SAID THINGS, FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN\nHE ATTACKED A JUDGE WHO WAS BORN IN THE UNITED STATES AND\nCLAIMING THAT HE COULDN'T BE FAIR, BECAUSE HE WAS MEXICAN,\nEVEN THOUGH HE WAS AMERICAN, YOU HAD PAUL RYAN, THE LEADER OF THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY, COMING OUT AND SAYING WHAT HE DID WAS SORT OF\nTHE TEXTBOOK EXPLANATION -- DEFINITION OF RACISM.\nSO, YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE AGREEING, I THINK, WITH\nDEMOCRATS ON THESE CRITICISMS. AND THEN AT THE SAME TIME, WHEN\nHE'S CALLING HER A BIGOT, HE'S NOT GETTING ANY BACKUP ON THAT\nFROM THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE THE RNC\nSPOKESPERSON IS REFUSING TO GO ALONG WITH THAT.\nSEAN SPICER IS REFUSING TO SAY SHE'S A BIGOT.\nSO I THINK THAT THESE ARE SORT OF TWO DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ARE\nGOING ON HERE. I THINK HE'S DOING NAME CALLING.\nI THINK SHE'S GOING THROUGH AND SHE'S OUTLINING A HISTORY OF\nTHINGS THAT HE HAS SAID AND DONE AND REALLY FOCUSING ON A\nRELATIONSHIP THAT SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN A LOT MORE ATTENTION, I\nTHINK, YOU KNOW, IT'S SURPRISING IT HASN'T GOTTEN MORE ATTENTION\nIN THE PAST. >> AND WE'RE STILL 74 DAYS OUT\nFROM ELECTION DAY. WE KNOW NEGATIVE CAMPAIGNING,\nYOU KNOW, WORKS. OTHERWISE, WE WOULDN'T SEE IT IN\nEACH ELECTION CYCLE. CAN IT GO TOO FAR, YOU THINK?\n>> YEAH. OF COURSE.\nIT CAN ALWAYS GO TOO FAR. BUT LOOK, WHAT DONALD TRUMP HAS\nBEEN DOING ALL ALONG, I THINK, HAS BEEN NEGATIVE CAMPAIGNING.\nAND IT'S WHY I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE, HE'S TURNED OFF A LOT OF\nPEOPLE IN PARTICULAR. WOMEN WITH A LOT OF THE ATTACKS\nTHAT HE DOES. HILLARY CLINTON HAS DONE --\nSHE'S DONE A SERIES OF SPEECHES WHERE SHE'S PROSECUTED THE CASE\nAGAINST HIM, WHETHER IT'S BEEN ON THE ECONOMY, WHETHER IT'S\nBEEN ON FOREIGN POLICY, AND NOW WITH THE ALT-RIGHT.\nAND I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT SHE'S DOING, AND SHE'S BASICALLY\nTRYING TO MAKE -- FURTHER STIGMATIZE HIM FOR SUBURBAN\nVOTERS WHO MAYBE ARE THINKING ABOUT VOTING FOR HIM.\nBASICALLY SAYING, THIS JUST IS NOT A PERSON YOU WANT TO BE\nASSOCIATED WITH. >> AND MAKING THAT CASE REALLY\nTO REPUBLICANS YESTERDAY. >> YES.\nI THINK THAT'S RIGHT. AND I THINK -- AND, BY THE WAY,\nI HEAR A LOT OF REPUBLICANS SAYING, WELL, LOOK, SHE'S GOING\nOUT AND CALLING REPUBLICANS RACIST AND SHE'S ATTACKING\nREPUBLICANS, WHEN, IN FACT, IN HER SPEECH, WHAT SHE DID IS, SHE\nSAID, THIS ISN'T THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\nTHIS IS NOT WHAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS KNOWN FOR.\nTHIS IS NO WHO REPUBLICANS ARE. AND SO SHE'S MAKING A MORE\nSUBTLE ARGUMENT. >> RIGHT.\nSHE ACTUALLY TALKED ABOUT JOHN McCAIN, SHE TALKED ABOUT GEORGE\nW. BUSH, MAKING A DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN THEM AND\nDONALD TRUMP. >> YEAH.\nRIGHT. >> THE -- I MEAN, DONALD TRUMP\nHAS CERTAINLY DICTATED THE TENOR OF THIS CAMPAIGN, CERTAINLY IN\nTHE PRIMARY. DO YOU THINK THIS KIND OF\nRHETORIC IS THE NEW NORMAL OR HAS POLITICAL SPEECH\nFUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED OR DO YOU THINK DONALD TRUMP IS SUCH A\nUNIQUE CHARACTER IN AMERICAN POLITICS IT'S NOT SOMETHING\nTHAT'S GOING TO BE REPEATED. >> I THINK HE'S A UNIQUE\nCHARACTER. AND HE'S SOMEBODY WHO IS NOT\nGOING TO STOP DOING THIS. EVEN WHEN EVERY TIME HE PIVOTS\nOR HE DOES HIS SOFTER SIDE, HE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE\nOUTBURSTS. AND SO WE SEE HIM SOFTENING ON\nIMMIGRATION, BUT THEN SCREAMING AND YELLING ABOUT HOW HILLARY\nCLINTON'S A BIGOT. SO I THINK HE WILL CONTINUE TO\nDO IT. AND I DON'T THINK IT TYPICALLY\nWORKS THAT WELL FOR PEOPLE, WHICH IS WHY HILLARY IS REALLY\nNOT DOING IT. AS MUCH AS PEOPLE WANT TO CLAIM\nTHAT SHE IS ATTACKING HIM THIS WAY, SHE ISN'T.\nI THINK SHE'S MAKING A GOOD DISTINCTION AND I THINK SHE'S\nRAISING ATTENTION TO SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT.\nLOOK, HE TOOK SOMEBODY WHO HEADED UP A WEBSITE, BREITBART,\nSTEVE BANNON, PUT HIM IN CHARGE OF HIS CAMPAIGN.\nTHIS IS >> GOOD TO HAVE YOU.\nTHANK YOU.",

YOU WROTE AN EDITORIAL THIS WEEK\nON WELFARE REFORM THAT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU, BUT FIRST I WANT TO\nASK YOU ABOUT IMMIGRATION. DURING THE PRIMARIES, YOU WERE\nVERY CLEAR ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF DEPORTING 11 MILLION\nUNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. YOUR POSITION WAS IF THEY\nHAVEN'T COMMITTED A CRIME WHILE THEY'RE HERE, PAY A FINE, BACK\nTAXES, MAYBE COMMUNITY SERVICE, AND A PATH TO LEGALIZATION.\nNOT CITIZENSHIP, BUT SOME LEGAL STATUS.\nYOU AND OTHERS WHO HELD THAT VIEW IN THE PRIMARIES, YOU WERE\nATTACKED BY OTHER REPUBLICANS. GIVEN WHAT WE'VE SEEN THE LAST\nFEW DAYS, DO YOU FEEL SOME SENSE OF VINDICATION?\n>> OH, YOU KNOW, VINDICATION? I DON'T THINK ABOUT VINDICATION.\nI DON'T NO WHAT WE'RE HEARING, FRANKLY, RIGHT NOW OUT OF THE\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN. I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHERE HE IS\nON THIS. BUT, YOU DESCRIBE MY POSITION\nWELL, AND YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A LOT OF, YOU KNOW, ANGST ABOUT\nIT. BUT, YOU KNOW, I WILL TELL YOU,\nANDERSON, THE WAY I FEEL IS IF THIS IS MOVING A LITTLE BIT,\nTHEN IT SHOULD BE GOOD NEWS FOR OUR FRIENDS IN THE HISPANIC\nCOMMUNITY, BECAUSE MANY OF THESE FAMILIES HAVE BEEN ON EDGE AND\nWE DON'T NEED THEM TO BE ON EDGE.\n>> BUT I GUESS IF I HAD BEEN IN YOUR SHOES AND RUNNING, SAYING,\nLOOK, THIS IS NOT FEASIBLE, AND OTHER FOLKS RUNNING AGAINST ME\nWERE SAYING, THAT'S JUST WEAK. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AMNESTY,\nAND NOW SEEM TO BE, PERHAPS, KIND OF MORPHING MORE TO YOUR\nOLD POSITION, I MEAN, I GUESS IT DOESN'T SURPRISE YOU THAT\nULTIMATELY -- >> IT DOESN'T.\nALL THESE PROBLEMS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IN OUR COUNTRY,\nMANY TIMES, BOTH COUNTRIES OFFER VERY SIMPLE SOLUTIONS TO VERY\nCOMPLICATED PROBLEMS. AND AT THE END OF IT ALL, IT\nCOMES DOWN TO COMPLICATED AND VERY PRECISE DECISIONS AND TO\nRESOLVE VERY HARD PROBLEMS. WE ALL KNOW THERE'S PROBLEMS.\nBUT YOU CAN'T JUST SOLVE THEM BY, YOU KNOW, JUST COMING UP\nWITH SOME LITTLE BOLD STATEMENT. IT TAKES A, AN EFFORT TO TRY TO\nLOOK AT THINGS 360 AND THEN COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT CAN\nRESOLVE THE PROBLEM. OUR PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY IS\nREPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS WERE SO POLARIZED, THAT IT'S HARD FOR\nTHEM TO COME TOGETHER IN A REALLY GOOD WAY TO GET THINGS\nDONE. >> YOU KNOW OHIO BETTER THAN\nANYBODY. YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T THINK DONALD\nTRUMP COULD WIN OHIO. DO YOU STILL THINK THAT'S THE\nCASE? >> WELL, I THINK IF YOU'RE A\nDIVIDER, YOU HAVE A VERY HARD TIME.\nI MEAN, WHAT YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT IN OHIO IS THERE ARE GOING TO BE\nPLACES IN OHIO WHERE DONALD TRUMP WILL DO VERY WELL, AND THE\nQUESTION IS, WHAT HAPPENS IN THE URBAN AREAS?\nAND IS HILLARY ABLE TO GENERATE EXCITEMENT IN THE URBAN AREAS?\nIF SHE CAN, SHE'LL WIN.

WHAT WORKS BEST FOR THEM.\n>> YOU KNOW, TO SOME DEGREE. TO SOME DEGREE.\nANDERSON, HERE'S THE PART -- >> WHAT PART OF WELFARE ISN'T\nWORKING AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO FIX IT IN OHIO?\n>> WE DESIGNED A WELFARE SYSTEM THAT GIVES A REWARD FOR WELFARE\nOFFICES TO PASS OUT THE BENEFITS AS FAST AS THEY CAN, WITH THE\nLEAST AMOUNT OF FRAUD. BUT AS A RESULT OF THAT, THERE\nIS NO EMPHASIS ON TAKING PEOPLE WHO ARE ON WELFARE AND ACTUALLY\nHELPING THEM TO GET OFF WELFARE. AND THIS WAS DESIGNED BY\nREPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS. AND WE ALSO KNOW WITH JOB\nTRAINING, THAT SYSTEM IS GOOFY, TOO, FOR THIS REASON.\nWE ACTUALLY GIVE A REWARD TO OFFICES THAT GET PEOPLE BACK TO\nWORK THE FASTEST, OKAY?

KAEPERNICK TOLD NFL MEDIA HE\nWON'T SHOW PRIDE FOR THE FLAG OF THE COUNTRY THAT, QUOTE, OP\nPRESSES BLACK PEOPLE AND PEOPLE OF COLOR.\nYOU CAN SEE HIM SITTING THERE ON THE BENCH IN THAT SHADOW, LOWER\nPART OF THE SCREEN. KAEPERNICK, BIRACIAL, SAYS IT\nWOULD BE SELFISH OF HIM TO LOOK THE OTHER WAY.\nOUR FOX NEW CONTRIBUTOR JOINS US IN LOS ANGELES FOR PERSPECTIVE\nON ALL THIS.

MANY YEARS AGO THE FORMER CHRIS\nJACKSON DIDN'T WANT TO STAND FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM BECAUSE IT\nWENT AGAINST WHAT WE H SAID WAS HIS RELIGION OF ISLAM SO HE SAT\nDURING THE ANTHEM FOR THE DEN JER NUGGETS.\nTHE NBA TOOK ACTION. BRIEFLY SUSPENDED HIM.\nTHEY WORK OUT A COMPROMISE WHERE HE ENDED UP LEAVING THE COURT\nFOR THE ANTHEM AND THEN EVENTUALLY HE DID STAND FOR THE\nNATIONAL ANTHEM. IF THIS IS WHAT KAEPERNICK WANTS\nTO DO, THEN HE'S ENTITLED TO. IT'S A FREE COUNTRY.\n>> HE'S ENTITLED TO DO WHATEVER HE WANTS.\nBACKLASH AND REPERCUSSIONS. THE 49ers DID ISSUE A STATEMENT.\nTHEY SAID HERE, THE NATIONAL ANTHEM IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE A\nSPECIAL PART OF THE PRE-GAME CEREMONY.\nRESPECTING SUCH AMERICAN PRINCIPLES OF FREEDOM OF\nRELIGION AND FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION WE RECOGNIZE THE\nRIGHT OF AN INDIVIDUAL TO PARTICIPATE OR NOT IN THE\nCELEBRATION OF OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM.\nTHE 49ers AGREE WITH YOU. WILL THE FANS AGREE WITH THE\n49ers? >> WELL, I THINK WE'RE GOING TO\nBE ALL OVER THE MAP. IF YOU LOOK AT THE REACTION.\nAND I THINK THE REACTION IS GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR\nHIM BECAUSE THE FANS DO COME AND STAND UP.\nON THE OTHER HAND, MAYBE THE NBA AND THE NFL AND THESE -- ALL OF\nTHESE LEAGUES SHOULD TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THIS.\nWHEN YOU GO TO A CONCERT FOR ADELE OR JAY-Z YOU DON'T STABBED\nFOR A NATIONAL ANTHEM. YES, IT IS TRADITION.\nBY THE SAME TONE WE JUST HAD 46 GOLD MEDAL WINNERS IN THE UNITED\nSTATES AT THE OLYMPICS AND 121 MEDALS AND I DIDN'T SEE ANY KIND\nOF DEMONSTRATION AND I'M NOT AWARE OF A DEMONSTRATION THAT\nTOOK PLACE DURING THE VICTORY PLATFORMS DURING THE NATIONAL\nANTHEM. HE'S GOING TO FACE A TOUGH ROAD\nHERE FOR THESE ACTIONS. BY THE WAY, HE IS BIRACIAL.\nHE WAS RAISED BY WHITE PARENTS AND ADOPTED BY WHITE PARENTS AND\nWHITE SIBLINGS.

THIS WOULD SEEM TO BE MAKING AN\nEQUAL KIND OF STATEMENT IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.\n>> I THINK THE NFL WILL LOOK AT THIS.\nTHEY HAVE YET TO DELIVER A RESPONSE.\nI THINK THEY WILL ASK HIM PROBABLY TO LEAVE THE FIELD MUCH\nLIKE THE NBA DID MANY YEARS AGO. AND IF HE'S NOT GOING TO WANT TO\nSTAND UP FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, JUST DON'T BE PRESENT\nBECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE AN EMBARRASSMENT FOR THE NATIONAL\nFOOTBALL LEAGUE AND IT COULD SPREAD.\nYOU COULD HAVE SEVERAL OTHER GUYS WHO WANT TO DO THIS IN\nCONCERT WITH HIM WHO ARE SYMPATHETIC TO HIS VIEWS AND\nTAKE THOSE VIEWS AND IT COULD SPREAD.\nI THINK THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE IS GOING TO ADOPT A\nPOLICY AND THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO IT IN A BIG HURRY.\n>> YOU THINK ABOUT THE BIG HURRY BECAUSE LAST SEASON THE NFL GOT\nUP IN THAT HUGE CONTROVERSY OF WHETHER THEY WERE TAKING MONEY\nFROM VARIOUS MILITARY BRANCHES FOR THESE CEREMONIES, ENLISTMENT\nCEREMONIES. FANS OF THE NFL DID NOT LIKE\nTHAT. YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT'S THE KIND\nOF DEMOGRAPHIC THAT MAY NOT LIKE MR. KAEPERNICK'S BEHAVIOR.\n>> YEAH. I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE\nPROBLEMATIC. THEY DID NOT LIKE THE FACT THAT\nTHEY WERE TAKING MONEY FOR THESE CEREMONIES AND FOR PLEDGING\nALLEGIANCE TO THE FLAG AND FOR SHOWING PATRIOTISM WHEN IN FACT\nTHEY WERE BEING PAID FOR IT. IT HAD A MAJOR BACKLASH.\nI THINK THE SAME THING HERE. YOU KNOW, COLIN KAEPERNICK IS\nFREE TO DO WHATEVER HE WANTS. RIGHT NOW HE'S FIGHTING FOR HIS\nFOOTBALL LIFE. HE'S GOING TO BE A BACKUP\nQUARTERBACK. HE'S LOST HIS STARTING JOB.\nHE'S GOING TO MAKE A $14 MILLION GUARANTEE THIS YEAR.\nSO HE IS FINANCIALLY SECURE. SO HE WANTS TO MAKE A STATEMENT.\nHE'S GOING TO MAKE THIS STATEMENT.\nI JUST THINK THAT THIS IS GOING TO HAVE LARGE REACHING AND\nRANGING REPERCUSSION BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF PLAYERS, WE\nSAW WITH CHRIS PAUL AND LeBRON JAMES AND CARMELO ANTHONY AND\nDWYANE WADE WHO UNFORTUNATELY JUST LOST HIS COUSIN YESTERDAY\nIN CHICAGO.

THEY WERE TRYING BACK THEN AND\nTHEY HAD THE SAME KIND OF FIGHTS AND THE SAME KIND OF\nDIVISIVENESS, IF NOT MORE SO, YET WE'RE STILL HERE HAVING THE\nARGUMENTS. SO THAT SAYS SOMETHING TO A\nGREATER, I THINK THE GREATER POINT WHICH IS IT'S A REALLY\nGOOD IDEA. WE HAVE TO KEEP TRYING TO FIND\nIT. >> WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT HOW\nDIVISIVE THIS CURRENT ELECTION YEAR IS, HAVING DONE THIS\nMUSICAL, DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE A GREATER SORT OF TOLERANCE\nFOR DIVISION, KNOWING WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT THE FOUNDING FATHERS\nAND THE DUELS THEY USED TO GET INTO?\n>> I THINK I AT LEAST HAVE A LITTLE MORE PATIENCE FOR THE\nPROCESS OF IT AND JUST ACCEPT THAT THIS IS WHERE WE ARE AND\nTRY TO FIND WAYS TO, YOU KNOW, PART OF DOING, FOR ME, DOING THE\nSHOW IS A MEANS BY WHICH YOU CAN PUSH AGAINST THE OCEAN A LITTLE\nBIT AND SAY HEY, THERE'S A BETTER WAY THAT WE CAN DO IT.\nEVENTUALLY EVERYONE GETS TIRED. EVENTUALLY EVERYONE GETS\nEXHAUSTED FROM IT. UNFORTUNATELY, THAT USUALLY IS\nTHE VOTING PUBLIC AND ONCE THE ELECTION IS OVER WITH,\nEVERYONE'S EXHAUSTED SO NO ONE WANTS TO BE INVOLVED ANYMORE.\nBUT MY HOPE IS THAT A SHOW LIKE \"HAMILTON\" KEEPS THAT INTEREST\nPIQUED. KEEPS THE 15 AND 16-YEAR-OLD\nKIDS SAYING HM, I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PAY A LITTLE MORE\nATTENTION IN CIVICS CLASS, I WILL FIGURE OUT A LITTLE MORE\nABOUT WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE I WAS BORN SO I CAN UNDERSTAND THE\nCONTEXT, HAVE A CONTEXT FOR WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW.\n>> YOU ARE A WRESTLING FAN, RIGHT?\n>> YES. >> BIG POLITICAL JUNKIES ON THE\nCAST. >> YES.\n>> WHAT'S THE TALK?

ABSOLUTELY.\nNONE OF IT IS LOST ON US. WE WERE IN THE EAST ROOM OF THE\nWHITE HOUSE PERFORMING FOR THE PRESIDENT THIS LAST SPRING AND\nIT WAS ALL OVER AND HE STOOD UP AND THANKED ME AND LYNN AND THE\nCAST AND WHEN HE FINISHED HIS REMARKS, WE WERE TAKING\nPICTURES, ABOUT TO TAKE PICTURES, AND I COULDN'T CONTAIN\nIT ANYMORE. I BURST OUT CRYING.\nI FOUND A SHOULDER SO I COULD COMPOSE MYSELF AND I STOOD UP\nTHINKING ABOUT IT, LIKE MY GRANDMOTHER WHO WAS SO CONCERNED\nABOUT US BEING CITIZENS, BEING BLACK, YOU KNOW, ACTIVE CITIZENS\nIN OUR COMMUNITY, IN OUR COUNTRY, SHE DREAMT SO MANY\nTHINGS FOR ME BUT SHE NEVER DREAMT THAT MOMENT.\nYOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? BUT SHE GAVE ME THE ROCKET FUEL\nTO KEEP PUSHING FORWARD AND THIS OPPORTUNITY AROSE AND I WOULD\nJUST LIKE TO THINK THERE WERE 100 OR SO KIDS IN THAT AUDIENCE\nTHAT DAY AND THAT'S THE THOUGHT THAT I HAVE WHEN I THINK ABOUT\nTHE EFFECT OF THIS SHOW, THAT WE KEEP BEING PUT IN PLACES WHERE\nWE CAN REACH SOMEONE WHOSE MIND IS STILL WILLING TO HEAR AND\nWILLING TO LEARN AND WILLING TO NOT HAVE THE KINDS OF OPINIONS\nTHAT KEEP THEM ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER BUT THAT JUST ALLOW\nTHEM TO BE CURIOUS AND DISCOVER ALL OF THE IDEAS.\nTHEY WANT, YOU KNOW, TO SEE ALL OF THE DIFFERENT STUFF.\nWHEN YOU CAN BE IN THAT POSITION, LIFE IS GOOD.\nTHE WORK IS GOOD. >> YOU HAVE MEDITATED A LOT ON\nTHE FAREWELL ADDRESS BECAUSE YOU SING A SONG ABOUT IT IN THE\nSHOW, ONE LAST TIME. TO THE EXTENT YOU UNDERSTAND HOW\nWASHINGTON THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT HE HAD TO DO WITH THAT SPEECH, HOW\nDO YOU THINK OBAMA WILL BE THINKING ABOUT WHAT HE HAS TO DO\nAND WHAT DO YOU HOPE TO HEAR HIM TALK ABOUT IN HIS FAREWELL\nADDRESS? >> I THINK A LOT ABOUT THAT IN\nTERMS OF WHERE HE WAS, WHICH WAS DESPERATELY SEEKING RELIEF FROM\nTHE OFFICE THAT HE HELD. HE NEEDED TO BE DONE, YOU KNOW.\nAND THAT'S FOR ME, EVERY NIGHT, THAT'S WHAT THE SONG REALLY\nREPRESENTS IS AN EXPRESSION OF THE STRENGTH AND HOPE THAT THE\nOFFICE GIVES YOU BUT ALSO THE FACT THAT IT BREAKS YOU DOWN\nUNTIL YOU HAVE NOTHING LEFT, UNTIL THREE WORDS ARE ALL YOU\nCAN REALLY SAY AND THAT'S WHAT ONE LAST TIME REALLY REPRESENTS\nTO ME. AND ENDEAVORING TO PASS THAT\nSENSE OF HOPE OFF TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC AND THE AMERICAN\nIDEA AT LARGE. PRESIDENT OBAMA FILLED I THINK A\nMAJORITY OF THE COUNTRY WITH HOPE IN 2008, AND THE CAMPAIGN\nLEADING UP TO IT. I WAS HOPEFUL.\nNOT JUST THE SYMBOLISM OF SEEING HIS FACE, YOU KNOW, EVERY TIME I\nLOOKED AT THE PRESIDENT KNOWING THAT THAT MAN LOOKS LIKE ME.\nMORE LIKE ME AND KNOWS MY EXPERIENCE MORE THAN PERHAPS ANY\nOTHER PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.\n>> HE'S A BIG FAN OF THE MUSICAL.\nBUT HE ALSO SORT OF TAKES CREDIT A LITTLE BIT.\n>> I KNOW. ABSOLUTELY.\n>> HOW REAL IS THAT? I KNOW HE HEARD THE MIX TAPE AND\nWENT TO THE WHITE HOUSE. CAN HE CLAIM ANY PART OF THE\nHAMILTON SUCCESS? CORRECT THE RECORD OR DON'T.\n>> PRESIDENTIAL PREROGATIVE, RIGHT?\nI WOULD SAY HE CERTAINLY HELPED. KNOWING LYNN AS WELL AS I DO, IF\nHE DIDN'T HAVE THAT MOMENT TO WRITE FOR AND TO PERFORM IT AND\nTO FIND THE SPARK AND THE WORDS THAT HE -- THAT CAME TO HIM\nEARLY ON, WHO CAN SAY WHETHER OR NOT IT WOULD HAVE --\n>> THAT SOUNDS LIKE CREDIT IS BEING GIVEN.\n>> I THINK LYNN GIVES HIM A LITTLE BIT OF CREDIT WITH A\nWINK. LOOK, THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN SO\nGRACIOUS AND SO KIND TO US AND YEAH, IF I WERE IN HIS SHOES I\nWOULD TAKE CREDIT FOR IT, TOO. >> TALK TO US A LITTLE ABOUT THE\nEMOTIONAL ENERGY OF PUTTING A SHOW LIKE THIS TOGETHER IN\nCOMPARISON TO OTHER SHOWS YOU HAVE DONE WHICH ARE EQUALLY\nBLOCKBUSTER HUGE SHOWS. >> I'M OLDER THAN I WAS WHEN --\n>> THAT'S A COP-OUT. >> NO, THAT'S REAL.\nIT IS EXHAUSTING IN A WAY THAT UNLIKE ANY OTHER SHOW THAT I\nHAVE EVER DONE, IN THAT THERE ARE MORE WORDS IN THIS SHOW THAN\nALMOST EVERY SHAKESPEARE PLAY. AND BECAUSE THE WHOLE THING IS\nSUNG THROUGH, ONCE THAT FIRST DOWN BEAT HAPPENS, IT DOESN'T\nSTOP. SO YOU HAVE GOT INTERMISSION BUT\nTHAT'S NOT REALLY, THAT'S SORT OF A FIVE-MINUTE RECOVERY AND\nSTART ADDING THE LAYERS OF VELVET AND THINGS THAT YOU HAVE\nTO WEAR FOR THE SECOND ACT SO IT'S DIFFERENT.\nIT'S TWO HOURS AND 40 SOME ODD MINUTES.\nIT'S A LONG SHOW. WE ARE PERFORMING AN OPERA EIGHT\nTIMES A WEEK. OPERA SINGERS SING MAYBE THREE\nTIMES A MONTH. IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF, JUST\nFROM A TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE ASPECT.\nAND YOU KNOW, LIFE HAPPENS OUTSIDE OF --\n>> IT DOES? OUTSIDE OF WORK?\n>> YEAH. YOU MISS A LOT.\nTHAT'S HOW IT WORKS. BUT YOU HAVE TO TRY TO KEEP UP\nWITH IT. SO YOU WALK IN THE DOOR, I\nALWAYS SAY YOU ARE NEVER 100% WHEN YOU DO A BROADWAY SHOW.\nYOU ARE NAVIGATING WHATEVER PERCENTAGE OF ENERGY, HEALTH,\nSTRENGTH YOU HAVE AND BECAUSE THIS SHOW, EVERYONE IN THE SHOW,\nWE ARE CLIMBING THIS MOUNTAIN IN THE FIRST ACT.\nIN THE SECOND ACT WE ARE ALL COMING DOWN THE SAME MOUNTAIN.\nEMOTIONALLY, WE HAVE VERY MUCH THE SAME KIND OF EXPERIENCE THE\nAUDIENCE HAS IN THAT WHERE IT ENDS UP AND WHERE WE ARE LOOKING\nTOWARD AT THE END OF THAT SHOW IS, WE ARE ALL AWASH WITH IT.\nTHAT'S WHY AFTER THE SHOW THE STAGE BECOMES A GREEN ROOM.\nI GENERALLY AM NOT LEAVING THE THEATER FOR AN HOUR AFTER THE\nCURTAIN GOES DOWN BECAUSE IT TAKES THAT MUCH TIME TO LIKE\nCOME DUNN. >> RIGHT.\n>> AND TO BE ABLE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS AND HANG OUT WITH\nPEOPLE THAT HAVE COME AND YOU'RE TAKING PICTURES AND SIGNING\nSTUFF. YOU'RE JUST COMMUNING WITH FOLKS\nBECAUSE IT BECOMES A VERY SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE BY THE END\nOF THE SHOW.

I WOULD CHECK IN WITH HIM BEFORE\nA SHOW. THAT'S JUST WHAT WE DO.\nYEAH, I MISS THAT A LITTLE BIT. BUT NOW I GO BANG ON THE SAME\nDRESSING ROOM AND YOU KNOW, CHECK IN ON JAVY BEFORE WE\nSTART. EACH SHOW, IT'S A DIFFERENT\nTEAMMATE. YOU HAVE TO FIND OUT WHERE HE\nLIKES TO GET THE BALL ON THE COURT.\nYOU HAVE TO SORT OF FIGURE OUT THAT NEW RHYTHM AND THEN YOU\nJUST GO. >> IT STILL MUST BE WEIRD TO\nHAVE SO MUCH OF THE ORIGINAL CAST NOW GONE.\nLIKE I KNOW THERE ARE STILL A FEW PEOPLE AROUND BUT LYNN'S\nGONE, LIZ IS GONE, DEBBIE IS GONE.\nYOU ARE LIKE AMONG THE BIG MALE LEADS, YOU ARE THE LAST ONE\nWHO'S LEFT. >> YOU ARE THE ELDER STATESMAN\nQUITE LITERALLY. >> YOU HAD TO SAY THAT.\n>> YEAH, I DID. >>  IT'S TRUE.\n>> YOU'RE GEORGE WASHINGTON, TOO.\n[ SPEAKING SIMULTANEOUSLY ] >> I WILL TELL YOU A SECRET\nABOUT THE CAST. FIRST OF ALL, THE ORIGINAL\nCOMPANY IS LIKE THE '92 DREAM TEAM.\nIT WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN. IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO.\nIT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN THEN AND IT DID AND GEEZ, WAS IT\nAMAZING. THEY DON'T PUT ANYBODY ON THAT\nSTAGE THAT IS NOT REALLY, REALLY GOOD.\nAND THE HEARTBEAT OF OUR SHOW IS NOT LYNN, IT'S NOT ME, IT'S NOT\nLESLIE OR DAVID. IT'S OUR ENSEMBLE.\nTHEY ARE THE SMARTEST, HARDEST WORKING GROUP OF PERFORMERS THAT\nHAVE BEEN ASSEMBLED IN A VERY LONG TIME ON A STAGE.\nTHEY ARE SO GOOD. THEIR WORK IS SO HARD.\nAND THE FACT THAT NO ONE KNOWS IT'S THAT HARD IS EVEN MORE\nTRIBUTE TO HOW INCREDIBLE THEY ARE.\nTHEY ARE -- WHEN WE ARE RUNNING ONSTAGE OR OFFSTAGE, YOU'RE NOT\nLOOKING AT US. YOU ARE LOOKING AT THEM.\nTHEY'RE THE REAL STORY TELLERS ON THE SHOW BECAUSE THEY CARRY\nUS FROM ONE THING TO THE NEXT. FROM ONE SCENE TO THE NEXT.\nFROM ONE ERA AND MOVEMENT TO THE NEXT.\nAT ONE MOMENT YOU'RE ONE PLACE AND THE NEXT YOU'RE AT ANOTHER.\nIT MAKES SENSE. THERE'S NO TRICKERY.\nIT'S OUR COMPANY. IT'S OUR ENSEMBLE.\nTHEY ARE SPECTACULAR. THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE WHOLE\nSHOW, THAT'S WHAT ELEVATES THE SHOW NO MATTER WHO'S PERFORMING.\n>> SO THE FIRST TIME I SAW THE SHOW, THE FIRST THING I THOUGHT\nWHEN I WALKED OUT WAS OKAY, I JUST SAW SOMETHING THAT'S GOING\nTO BE AROUND FOREVER. LIKE THIS WILL BE, EVERY HIGH\nSCHOOL IN AMERICA WILL PERFORM THIS SHOW AT SOME POINT.\nHISTORY WILL GET TAUGHT THIS WAY FOR 12-YEAR-OLDS, THIS IS LIKE\nTHE WAY THEY WILL COME TO FIRST GET ACCOUNT OF THIS HISTORY.\nTHEN THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION WROTE A BIG CHECK AND SAID MAKE\nA CURRICULUM ON THIS. I KNOW YOU JUST SAID THE CAST IS\nLIKE, THE COMPANY IS LIKE THE '92, THE ORIGINAL CAST LIKE THE\n'92 DREAM TEAM. YOU WILL ALSO NEVER BE IN\nANYTHING LIKE THIS AGAIN. YOU WILL NEVER BE IN ANOTHER\nTHING THAT WILL LIVE FOREVER. LONG AFTER YOU'RE GONE THIS WILL\nBE PART OF THE FABRIC OF AMERICAN EDUCATIONAL\nINSTITUTION, CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS OF THE COUNTRY.\nHOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL? IT MUST BE A HARD THING TO KIND\nOF RECKON WITH. >> YEAH.\nI GUESS SO. I'M NOT -- I DON'T HAVE TO DO\nTHAT RIGHT NOW. I KIND OF FEEL LIKE OKAY, WELL,\nI'LL JUST LET IT SETTLE ON ME AS TIME GOES BY.\nSINCE I'M LONG IN THE TOOTH, WHEN I GET IN MY ROCKING CHAIR.\nNO, I THINK IT'S REALLY GREAT. I THINK THAT HISTORY WAS THE ONE\nTHING I WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN WHEN I WAS IF HIGH SCHOOL AND\nTHE ONLY THING I CONSISTENTLY GOT As IN, THAT AND MUSIC.\nSO I'M HOPING THERE'S ANOTHER LYNN OR CHRIS OR SUE SITTING IN\nTHE CLASSROOM HAVING MEMORIZED ALL THE TUNES ON THE CD, OPENS\nTHE PAGE AND READS THE WORDS OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN IN A SLIGHTLY\nDIFFERENT WAY. NOT THAT THE WORDS HAVE TO\nCHANGE. NOT THAT THEY HAVE TO BE IN\nMETER OR RHYME. BUT THAT HE WAS A VERY REAL\nPERSON WHO WOKE UP IN THE MORNING AND BRUSHED HIS TEETH\nAND WENT TO WORK AND FACED DOWN ALL OF THESE INCREDIBLE\nCHALLENGES AND FELT ALL THE WAY THROUGH IT WHILE HE WAS MAKING\nDECISIONS, WHILE THINGS WERE HAPPENING.\nI THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT. I THINK IF THIS SHOW HAS ANY\nPOWER, IT REMINDS US THAT HUMAN BEINGS ARE DOING ALL OF THIS.\nIT'S NOT JUST A DATE OR NAME OR EVENT.\nHUMAN BEINGS SORT OF MOVED THROUGH THE WORLD AND MADE\nDECISIONS AND EFFECTED CHANGE AND THEY SHOULD BE PICKING UP\nTHE MANTLE TO DO THE SAME THING. >> I WANT TO ASK YOU ONE LAST\nQUESTION. YOU LOVE HIP-HOP.\n>> LOVE IT. >> THE SHOW IS DELIGHTFUL FOR\nANYBODY WHO ENJOYS THE POWER OF RHYME, RIGHT.\nOF ALL THE LINES THAT YOU DELIVER, WHAT'S THE ONE THAT\nLIKE STILL AS A COUPLET OR A RHYME, EVERY NIGHT YOU DO IT\nYOU'RE LIKE THIS IS THE ONE YOU MOST ENJOY.\n>> WHAT'S YOUR PERSONAL HOOK? >> WHAT DO YOU MOST ENJOY\nUNCORKING EVERY NIGHT? >> IT'S IN RIGHT HAND MAN.\nTHE VENERATED VIRGINIAN WHOSE MEN ARE LINING UP TO PUT ME ON A\nPEDESTAL, WRITING LETTERS TO RELATIVES, EMBELLISHING MY\nELOQUENCE BUT THE ELEPHANT IS IN THE ROOM, THE TRUTH IS IN YOUR\nFACE WHEN YOU HEAR THE BRITISH CANNONS GO BOOM.\n>> BOOM.

I WILL SAY BILL CLINTON COMING\nOUT WHILE TRAVELING IN GEORGIA MAKING HIMSELF AVAILABLE AND LO\nAND BEHOLD, HE WAS WILLING TO TAKE A QUESTION ABOUT THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION. >> LET'S HEAR THE ANSWER.\n>> I MADE IT CLEAR THAT IF SHE BECOMES PRESIDENT, WE'LL HAVE TO\nDO MORE THAN WE DID WHEN SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE BECAUSE IF\nYOU MAKE A MISTAKE, [ INAUDIBLE ].\nIF YOU ARE PRESIDENT, YOU CAN'T. >> HE'S TRYING TO ANSWER THE\nQUESTION WHY ARE YOU MAKING CHANGES FOR THE PRESIDENCY YOU\nDIDN'T MAKE FOR SECRETARY OF STATE.\n>> I THINK WHEN THERE WAS SOME JUDGMENT CALL TO BE MADE ABOUT\nTHE FOUNDATION IT STRIKES ME AS ODD.\nHE TALKED ABOUT HOW THEY WOULD UNWIND IT, THE EMPLOYEES, THE\nGOOD WORK THEY DO. THERE SEEMS TO BE A RELUCTANCE\nTO WANT TO LET IT GO ALTHOUGH HE HAS SAID HE WON'T RAISE MONEY\nBUT I THINK IT IS PART OF THE FAMILY, IT'S LIKE AN HEIRLOOM.\nTHEY DON'T WANT TO LET IT GO. >> IT FEELS LIKE YOU WONDER,\nIT'S ALMOST LIKE WE'RE IN DENIAL FOR TOO LONG AND IT LOOKS LIKE\nTHEY'RE SLAPPING TOGETHER A PLAN.\n>> USUALLY HE CLEANS THINGS UP AND HE RAISED MORE QUESTIONS.\n>> MICHAEL? YOUR MOMENT OF THE WEEK?\n>> MY FAVORITE WAS A TWEET FROM FORMER HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER\nERIC CANTOR. A STRONG SUPPORTER OF GOVERNOR\nBUSH IN THE PRIMARIES, WHO THANKED DONALD TRUMP FOR\nEMBRACING JEB BUSH'S IMMIGRATION PLAN.\n>> WHAT WAS INTERESTING ABOUT JEB BUSH, THOUGH, IS HE WENT ON\nRITA COSBY, TRUST ME, SOME OF US TRYING TO BOOK GOVERNOR BUSH\nEVERY NOW AND THEN, HE KEEPS SAYING I'M NOT GOING TO GET\nINVOLVED. HE COULDN'T HELP HIMSELF.\nHE REALLY DID WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT.\nHE WASN'T PRAISING TRUMP AT ALL. HE DIDN'T BELIEVE HIM.\n>> I THINK HE COMES FROM THE SAME DEEP PLACE OF SKEPTICISM\nTHAT I DO.

I'M THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF\nINDIANA, I'M RUNNING FOR VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\n>> LOOK, THE BARBER, I WATCHED THE WHOLE THING, HE WAS GREAT,\nHOW ABOUT THAT. HE WAS VERY EXCITED.\nHE WAS GENUINELY EXCITED. >> HE SAID HOW ABOUT THAT.\n>> BY THE WAY -- >> HE DIDN'T BLINK.\n>> BOTH TIM KAINE AND MIKE PENCE HAVE PROBABLY NEED TO GO --\n>> THE TV CAMERA BEING THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A TIP-OFF.\n>> WE THINK PEOPLE ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS.\nIT GOES TO SHOW YOU EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE COUNTRY IS HAVING\nSUMMERTIME. >> WHAT WAS INTERESTING IN OUR\nNBC/\"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" POLLING, IT IS THE LOWEST SORT\nOF OPINION ABILITY RATING WE HAVE EVER SEEN FOR EITHER VICE\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO FELT THEY\nCOULD RATE THEM. THEY DON'T KNOW THEM.\n>> THE CANDIDATES MAY HAVE CHOSEN THEM FOR THAT VERY\nREASON. >> SO THAT DEBATE IS GOING TO\nBE, WE'LL BE WATCHING BUT I WILL BE CURIOUS TO SEE HOW MUCH OF\nAMERICA WILL BE WATCHING. >> I DON'T KNOW.\nTHAT'S TOUGH. I HAVE THIS FEELING --\n>> I HAVE BEEN COUNTING DOWN THE DAYS BUT I KNOW NOT EVERYONE\nFEELS THAT WAY. >> I HAVE A FEELING THAT DEBATE\nWILL BE THE ONE PEOPLE SAY HOW COME THE TICKET IS --\n>> THEY ARE BOTH THE GREAT DEFENDERS.\nTHEY WILL TRY TO FIX THE PROBLEMS FOR THE TOP OF THE\nTICKET. >> THE FIRST DEBATE FOR\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES HAS TO BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST POLITICAL\nEVENTS IN YEARS. >> LET ME STICK WITH VP A\nSECOND. HAVE THEY BEEN EFFECTIVE?\nYOU KNOW, THEY HAVEN'T HURT, NEITHER ONE HAS HURT THE TICKET.\nBOTH HAVE BEEN DO NO HARM. HAS PENCE HELPED?\n>> YEAH, I THINK SO. BUT HE'S NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO --\nI HELPED OUT WHEN PAUL RYAN WAS RUNNING FOR VICE PRESIDENT IN\n2012 AND WE WERE BY KIND OF THIS POINT IN THE PROCESS DOING TWO\nPUBLIC EVENTS PLUS A FUND-RAISER, PLUS A LOT OF LOCAL\nMEDIA EVERY SINGLE DAY ALL DAY, EVERY DAY.\nI DON'T GET THE SENSE THERE'S ANYTHING LIKE THAT KIND OF TEMPO\nEITHER IN TERMS OF PUBLIC EVENTS OR FUND-RAISING OR THAT IT'S IN\nTHE RIGHT PLACE TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS.\n>> NO OFFENSE TO MICHAEL, YOU HAVE COVERED MORE OF THESE\nPRESIDENTIAL AND VICE PRESIDENTIAL, ESPECIALLY VICE\nPRESIDENTIALS. THERE IS THAT MOMENT, ARE BOTH\nPENCE AND KAINE, DO YOU FEEL THEY ARE BOTH RUNNING AT FULL\nSPEED THE WAY WE SAW RYAN? >> I THINK THAT RYAN, WHO WE\nKNOW IS AN ATHLETE, WAS RUNNING AT A REALLY HARD PACE TO BEGIN\nWITH. I THINK PENCE AND KAINE EACH\nHAVE A DAY JOB THAT THERE'S A FACTOR TO THAT, BUT I DO THINK\nTHEY HAVE DONE A COUPLE THINGS WELL.\nI THINK TIM KAINE HAS BEEN ABLE TO SPEAK ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON\nIN WAYS THAT IT'S NOT EASY FOR HER TO TALK ABOUT HERSELF.\nTHAT'S BEEN USEFUL. AND PENCE HAS BEEN ABLE TO BRING\nHIS SUNNY DISPOSITION TO RESPOND TO SOME OF TRUMP'S MORE\nDIFFICULT RHETORIC AND TO DO IT IN A WAY WHERE HE IS NOT REALLY\nDISTANCING HIMSELF BUT HE SORT OF TURNS THE VOLUME DOWN.\nTHAT'S BEEN HELPFUL. >> IN TIM KAINE'S DEFENSE, HE\nALSO PROBABLY JUST SHUT THE DOOR, PUT AWAY VIRGINIA.\n>> OH, YES. >> TIM KAINE PUT AWAY VIRGINIA\nFOR HILLARY. >> I THIN KELLY'S RIGHT, MIKE\nPENCE IS ABLE TO TALK TO REPUBLICANS, ESPECIALLY\nREPUBLICAN LEADERS WHO ARE MORE COMFORTABLE WITH HIM THAN THE\nTOP OF THE TICKET. >> PENCE'S SCHEDULE SEEMS TO BE\nSTRATEGIC.

DO YOU THINK IT'S BLUSTER?\nDO YOU THINK HE'S OVERCONFIDENT? >> I'D PUT UP MONEY.\nIT'S NOT GOING TO BE A BLOWOUT. WHEN I SAY NOT GOING TO BE A\nBLOWOUT. I THINK IN TERMS OF THE\nPERCENTAGE DIFFERENCE. IT MAY BE AN ELECTORAL STRONG\nSTANCE BUT IT'S NOT LIKE 1964. IT'S NOT LIKE 1984 OR 1972.\nTHOSE WERE ELECTIONS THAT JUST KEPT GOING IN ONE DIRECTION.\nTHIS HAS BEEN MUCH MORE SEESAW. >> LET ME ASK YOU THE FINAL\nQUESTION WHICH IS THIS NEGATIVE FEELING, THIS SPIRALING DOWN.\nTHAT DOES HAVE AN IMPACT ON TURNOUT.\nIT LIKELY -- I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A HIGH TURNOUT SIX MONTHS\nAGO. THOUGHT ONE-SIDED HIGH\nDEMOCRATIC, LOW REPUBLICAN TURNOUT.\nI DON'T HAVE A GOOD SENSE FOR IT THIS YEAR.\nTHE NUMBERS DON'T GIVE US A GOOD SENSE.\n>> 4 OF THE 12 PEOPLE SAID TO ME, I WOULD CONSIDER VOTING FOR\nA THIRD PARTY CANDIDATE.

NOT SOMETHING HE SAID BUT\nSOMETHING HE DID. HIS HISTORY WITH THE CENTRAL\nPARK FIVE. EVEN IF YOU CAN MAKE VALID\nCRITICISMS OF CERTAIN THINGS HILLARY CLINTON HAS SAID, AND\nYOU CAN, IT'S REALLY TOUGH FOR DONALD TRUMP TO GO THERE GIVEN\nHIS OWN HISTORY. >> WHEN THESE MOMENTS HAPPEN, HE\nDOESN'T DISAVOW THEM. HE DOESN'T SPEAK TO WHAT HE'S\nGOING TO DO. HE SIMPLY TRIES TO DEFLECT BACK\nTO HILLARY CLINTON. WE WILL HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH\nHILLARY CLINTON, AND SHE WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR ANYTHING\nTHAT HAPPENS. THAT'S PART OF THE POLITICAL\nPROCESS. NOW WE'RE HAVING A DISCUSSION\nABOUT TRUMP AND WHAT IS HE GOING TO SAY ABOUT HIS RECORD?\n>> RASHAD ROBINSON AND JOY REED. WE'LL BE WATCHING TOMORROW,\"\nA.M. JOY.\"",

LISTEN.\n>> SOFTENING, EVEN LAST NIGHT YOU TALKED ABOUT --\n>> I DON'T THINK IT'S A SOFTENING.\n>> BUT 11 MILLION PEOPLE ARE NO LONGER GOING TO BE DEPORTED.\n>> I THINK IT'S A HARDENING. >> BOTTOM LINE, CONGRESSMAN,\nTHERE'S SOME LACK OF CLARITY ABOUT WHERE DONALD TRUMP IS.\nHE FLIPPED, E HE FLOPPED, HE FLIPPED BACK.\nCAN YOU STILL SUPPORT HIS POSITIONS WHEN IT COMES TO\nIMMIGRATION? >> I INTEND TO SUPPORT HIM AS A\nCANDIDATE. WE HAVE TWO CHOICES.\nIT'S PRETTY CLEAR FROM A CONSERVATIVE AND REPUBLICAN\nPERSPECTIVE AND A CONSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE.\nI WOULD LIKE TO HEAR CLARIFICATION.\nHE SAID THERE WAS A SOFTENING AND NOW A HARDENING.\nI THINK THE WAY TO FIND OUT IS THAT TO ASK IS HE GOING TO PUT\nAN END TO EXECUTIVE AMNESTY. IF HE SAYS YES, HE'S IN THE SAME\nCAMP HE'S BEEN IN ALL ALONG. I WOULD ALSO E REMIND PEOPLE YOU\nCANNOT RESTORE THE RULE OF LAW BY REWARDING LAWBREAKERS.\nAND SO WE CAN'T LET OUR HEARTS GET AHEAD OF OUR HEADS.\nAND DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN IN THE RIGHT PLACE WITH IMMIGRATION ALL\nALONG.

I THINK HILLARY CLINTON BROUGHT\nTHAT TO THE ATTENTION OF A LOT OF US.\nWHEN I LISTEN TO THAT, IT E REMINDS ME OF THE VAST RIGHT\nWING CONSPIRACY SPEECHES. THE LABELS, THOSE ARE TIRED\nLABELS. JUST OCCURS TO ME HER POSITION\nTHAT NO ONE CAN DETERMINE THE GENDER OF SOMEONE ELSE, THAT'S\nEXCLUSIVELY IN THEIR HEAD. WHERE DOES SHE GET THE AUTHORITY\nTO DECLARE SOMEONE TO BE A BIGOT OR A RACIST?\n>> YOU CALLED A BIGOT A TIRED LABEL.\nYOUR NOMINEE, THE GOP NOMINEE CALLED HILLARY CLINTON A BIGOT.\nDO YOU THINK HILLARY CLINTON IS A BIGOT?\n>> I DON'T USE NAMES LIKE THAT. BUT IT CHEAPENS IT ALL WHENEVER\nIT COMES OUT. AND ESPECIALLY THE DOG EARED\nRACIST CARD.

TRUMP CALLS HIMSELF THE LAW AND\nORDER CANDIDATE, SAYS POLICE NEED TO GET MUCH TOUGHER.\nIN AN INTERVIEW LAST NIGHT, HE DOUBLED DOWN ON HIS CLAIM THAT\nHIS RIVAL IS, QUOTE, A BIGGOT. >> SHE IS A BIGGOT.\nYOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE INNER CITIES, TO AFRICAN\nAMERICANS AND HISPANICS IN THIS COUNTRY WHERE SHE TALKS ALL THE\nTIME -- >> HOW IS SHE BIGGOTED?\n>> BECAUSE SHE'S SELLING THEM DOWN THE TUBES.\nSHE'S NOT DOING ANYTHING FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES.\nSHE TALKS A GOOD GAME. >> SHE HAS DISLIKE OF BLACK\nPEOPLE? >> HER POLICIES ARE BIGGOTED\nBECAUSE SHE KNOWS THEY'RE NOT GOING TO WORK.\n>> BUT YOU'RE SAYING SHE'S PERSONALLY BIGGOTED?\n>> OF COURSE SHE IS. >> CLINTON CITED NUMEROUS\nEXAMPLES YESTERDAY TO LINK TRUMP TO RACISM, TRUMP IS PUTTING\nFORTH VERY LITTLE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT HIS CLAIM.\nCONSIDER THE REPUBLICAN REACTION TO CLINTON'S SPEECH.\nNORMALLY THE GOP WOULD RALLY AROUND ITS PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE\nAFTER SUCH AN ATTACK. PARTICULARLY WHEN HE'S BEING\nLINKED TO SOMETHING AS ODIOUS AS EXPLICIT RACISM.\nINSTEAD, WE'VE HEARD CRICKETS FROM TOP REPUBLICANS, PERHAPS\nBECAUSE TRUMP AND HIS POLICIES HAVE ALREADY BEEN DEEMED RACIST,\nEITHER EXPLICITLY OR IMPLICITLY. REMEMBER BACK IN JUNE, HOUSE\nSPEAKER PAUL RYAN CALLED TRUMP'S ATTACK ON A FEDERAL JUDGE FOR\nHIS HERITAGE, QUOTE, THE TEXTBOOK DEFINITION OF A RACIST\nCOMMENT.  THINK HE SAW THE SPEECH.\nAND AS FOR TRUMP'S CHARGE OF BIGOTRY, SEAN SPICER COULD NOT\nBRING HIMSELF TO BACK HIS NOMINEE IN AN INTERVIEW WITH\nMSNBC THIS MORNING. >> DO YOU THINK HILLARY\nCLINTON'S A BIGGOT? >> NO, I MEAN -- I THINK SOME OF\nTHE POLICIES THAT SHE'S SCHTED HAVE NOT HELPED THE AFRICAN\nAMERICAN, BUT ANYBODY WHO KNOWS ME, I JUST DON'T TEND TO USE\nCERTAIN WORDS. BUT AGAIN, I'M NOT -- SO THAT'S\nNOT SOMETHING THEY MIGHT PERSONALLY SAY, NO.\n>> IN HER SPEECH YESTERDAY, SHE CITED BOB DOLE, GEORGE BUSH AND\nJOHN McCAIN FOR PUSHING BACK AGAINST RACIST RHETORIC.\nIN AN INTERVIEW WITH MSNBC THIS MORNING, CLINTON DISCUSSED HER\nCHOICE TO DELIBERATELY CLEVE TRUMP OFF FROM THE REST OF HIS\nPARTY. >> I AM REACHING OUT TO\nEVERYONE -- REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS, INDEPENDENTS --\nEVERYONE WHO IS AS TROUBLED AS I AM BY THE BIGOTRY AND\nDIVISIVENESS OF DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN.\nAND I'VE SAID REPEATEDLY, THIS IS NOT A NORMAL CHOICE BETWEEN A\nREPUBLICAN AND A DEMOCRAT. WE'RE NOT JUST DISCUSSING OUR\nDIFFERENT VIEWS ON TAX POLICY OR ANYTHING ELSE OF IMPORTANCE.\nWE ARE FACING A DIVISIVE CANDIDATE WHOSE LOOSE CANNON\nTEMPERAMENT AND HIS COMPLETE LACK OF PREPARATION MAKE HIM\nUNQUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT AND TEMPERAMENTALLY UNFIT TO BE\nCOMMANDER IN CHIEF. >> JOINING ME NOW, KATIE PACKER,\nDEPUTY CAMPAIGN FOR MITT ROMNEY IN 2012.\nARGUED THIS WEEK CLINTON SHOULD LET PAUL RYAN AND THE GOP GO\nDOWN WITH THE TRUMP SHIP. LET ME START WITH YOU, KATIE.\nSO THERE'S THIS REALLY INTERESTING TACTICAL DECISION\nTHE HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS TO MAKE.\nDO YOU CLEAVE TRUMP OFF FROM THE GOP OR ATTEMPT TO YOLK HIM TO\nTHE REST OF THE GOP? SO HOWEVER PAUL RYAN IS TROUBLED\nBY THAT COMMENT, HE'S GOING TO VOTE FOR HIM, AS ARE MANY OTHER\nREPUBLICANS. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS CHOICE\nHE'S MADE TO CLEAVE HIM OFF FROM THE REST OF THE GOP?\n>> WELL, I THINK IT'S INTERESTING.\nAND HILLARY CLINTON HAS CLEARED SEEN AN OPPORTUNITY, GIVEN THE\nFACT THAT TRUMP IS ONLY ATTRACTING 70% OF REPUBLICAN\nVOTERS. NORMALLY THAT NUMBER, BY THE\nTIME YOU GET TO A GENERAL ELECTION IS UP IN THE 90s.\nSO THAT MEANS THERE'S 23% OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS WHO AREN'T\nCOMFORTABLE WITH THIS NOMINEE. SO SHE'S TRYING TO APPEAL TO\nTHEM. AT THE SAME TIME, SHE DOES HAVE\nTO TAKE SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR HER PARTY AND THE FACT THAT THEY\nHAVE FAILED THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND MANY MINORITY\nCOMMUNITIES. IF YOU LOOK AT THE INNER\nCITIES -- >> WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?\n>> -- THEY'RE ALMOST ALL OVER THE PLACE RUN BY DEMOCRAT\nLEADERSHIP. MY HOME CITY OF DETROIT MICHIGAN\nHAS HAD DEMOCRAT LEADERS FOR MY ENTIRE LIFETIME AND THAT CITY\nHAS STRUGGLED -- >> AND YOU THINK THAT'S BECAUSE\nOF THE PARTY IN CHARGE? WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE\nGOVERNOR OF MARYLAND CUTTING OFF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN\nTRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT TO THE WEST SIDE OF\nBALTIMORE JUST A FEW MONTHS AFTER THE UPRISING, AS AN\nEXAMPLE OF LIMITATIONS OF MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS NOT BEING\nABLE TO SERVE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES?\n>> I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THAT EXAMPLE.\n>> IT'S A PERFECT EXAMPLE, ISN'T IT?\n>> I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THAT ISSUE TO RESPOND TO IT.\nBUT I THINK SUCCESSFUL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE GOVERNMENTS THAT\nWORK WITH THEIR GOVERNORS OF BOTH PARTIES.\nAND I DO THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE DEMOCRATIC\nPARTY HAS TO ANSWER TO. >> RICK, WHAT DO YOU THINK?\n>> IT'S SOMETHING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS TO A",

WELL, WHEN THEY COME BACK IN, IF\nTHEY COME BACK IN. >> THAT WAS DONALD TRUMP TALKING\nTO CNN'S ANDERSON COOPER IN NEW HAMPSHIRE YESTERDAY.\nLIKE HILLARY CLINTON, THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE HAS BEEN ON\nBOTH OFFENSE AND DEFENSE THIS WEEK AS TRUMP KEEPS MAKING HIS\nPITCH TO MINORITY VOTERS AND TRYING TO EXPLAIN JUST WHAT IS\nHIS POLICY ON IMMIGRATION AND DEPORTATIONS.\nJOINING US FROM TRUMP TOWER IS NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT KATY TUR,\nMY FELLOW ROAD WARRIOR. NICE TO SEE YOU.\nTHANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I ACTUALLY WANT TO START WITH,\nNOT WITH DEPORTATIONS BUT WITH THIS NEW HILLARY CLINTON AD.\nAND THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN SO FAST TO RESPOND TO THESE\nACCUSATIONS AROUND THIS IDEA OF RACISM AND THE ALT-RIGHT WHEN\nTHEY PUT OUT THAT WEB VIDEO YESTERDAY, THE RESPONSE WAS\nALMOST INSTANTANEOUS. WHAT'S YOUR SENSE OF THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN'S TAKE ON THIS NEW TV AD FROM THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN\nTODAY? >> Reporter: WELL, THEY DON'T\nTHINK IT'S FAIR OR APPROPRIATE AND THEY ARE CALLING THESE SORTS\nOF ADS DISGUSTING. I CAN TELL YOU IN COVERING THIS\nCAMPAIGN FOR THE PAST 14 MONTHS THERE HAVE BEEN FEW OCCASIONS\nWHERE THEY HAVE COME OUT AND IMMEDIATELY PUSHED BACK ON\nSOMETHING, AND THIS WAS THE FASTEST PUSH-BACK I HAVE EVER\nSEEN THEM COME OUT WITH. ONCE HILLARY CLINTON CAME OUT\nWITH THAT AD FIRST LINKING HIM TO WHITE SUPREMACISTS, THE ONE\nWITH THE MAN IN THE KKK COSTUME AND THE ONE USING DONALD TRUMP'S\nWORDS, THEN ALSO THE IMAGERY OF THESE RALLIES, THEY SAID THIS IS\nNOT FAIR, THIS IS DISGUSTING AND WE DO NOT AGREE WITH IT.\nTHEY HAD A LOT OF THEIR SURROGATES COME OUT AND DO THE\nSAME THING. THEY ARE VERY FEARFUL THAT THIS\nIS SOMETHING THAT WILL RESONATE WITH VOTERS.\nTHIS IDEA THAT DONALD TRUMP IS A RACIST OR SOMEHOW CONDONES WHITE\nSUPREMACY. AT THE MOMENT THEY TRYING TO\nAPPEAL TO BLACK AND HISPANIC VOTERS, TRYING TO CREATE SOME\nOUTREACH, CREATE SOME GOOD WILL. THERE IS EVEN TALK BEHIND THE\nSCENES OF GOING TO MORE URBAN AREAS TO TRY AND SPEAK DIRECTLY\nWITH AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND HISPANIC VOTERS, BUT SO FAR,\nTHEY HAVEN'T BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN COURTING THEM.\nTHEY ARE FEARFUL OF THE IDEA OF BEING, DONALD TRUMP BEING\nPAINTED IN A RACIST WAY BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO FURTHER HAMPER\nTHEIR EFFORTS TO MAKE INROADS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES.\n>> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS DONE TO TRY TO FIGHT\nBACK AGAINST THIS IS CALLING HILLARY CLINTON A BIGOT.\nHE CALLS HER A BIGOT ALL THE TIME.\nLAST NIGHT IN THAT EXCHANGE WITH ANDERSON COOPER, I COULDN'T\nTELL. DOES HE KNOW WHAT THE WORD BIGOT\nMEANS OR IS HE BEING KIND OF INTENTIONALLY OBTUSE TO USE THE\nWORD AS JUST A DEFENSIVE TACTIC? >> Reporter: YOU KNOW, I DON'T\nKNOW. I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT DONALD\nTRUMP KNOWS WHAT THE WORD BIGOT MEANS.\nI IMAGINE HE DOES. ANDERSON COOPER ASKED HIM A FEW\nTIMES IF HE MEANT THAT HER POLICIES WERE BIGOTED OR IF HE\nMEANT SHE WAS PERSONALLY A BIGOT, AND HE SAID THAT HE\nBELIEVES SHE IS PERSONALLY A BIGOT, THEN WENT ON TO EXPLAIN\nHE DOESN'T THINK HER POLICIES HAVE BEEN HELPFUL FOR\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS. SO DOES DONALD TRUMP KNOW THE\nWEBSTER DICTIONARY DEFINITION OF BIGOT, I DON'T KNOW.\nI MEAN, I DON'T KNOW DONALD TRUMP WELL ENOUGH TO SAY THAT\nONE WAY OR ANOTHER. BUT HE HAS HAD A HISTORY OF\nCOMING OUT AND SAYING INFLAMMATORY THINGS, OUTRAGEOUS\nTHINGS, EXTREME THINGS, AND THIS IS NO DIFFERENT.\n>> KATY, CLEARLY WE HAVE SEEN THE FINGERPRINTS OF TRUMP'S NEW\nCAMPAIGN STAFF ALL OVER THE EVENTS OF THE LAST COUPLE OF\nWEEKS. IT'S CLEARLY MADE A REAL\nDIFFERENCE. I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT A LITTLE\nBIT OF NEWS TODAY THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HIRING BILL STEPIEN,\nTHE FORMER OUSTED CHRISTIE AIDE. DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF WHAT'S\nDRIVING THIS, WHY THEY'RE BRINGING HIM IN, WHAT HE CAN\nACCOMPLISH INSIDE THE CAMPAIGN? >> Reporter: BILL STEPIEN IS A\nPOLITICAL OPERATIVE THAT DOES HAVE EXPERIENCE BEHIND HIM.\nWHEN I SPOKE TO PEOPLE WITHIN THE CAMPAIGN TODAY AND ASKED\nTHEM ABOUT THIS, WHEN THEY FOUND OUT ABOUT IT, THEY CALLED IT AI\nBIT OF A DUMB MOVE BECAUSE HE IS AS WE KNOW EMBROILED IN THE\nBRIDGEGATE SCANDAL. I THINK THIS IS AN INDICATION\nTHAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS HAVING A HARD TIME HIRING\nQUALIFIED AND WELL-RESPECTED REPUBLICAN OPERATIVES.\nWE HAVE KNOWN THIS FOR QUITE SOME TIME.\nTHEY AREN'T GETTING THE PICK OF THE LITTER BECAUSE SO FEW PEOPLE\nRESPECT DONALD TRUMP'S CANDIDACY IN REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP.\nTHIS WAS SOMETHING THEY DIDN'T HAVE MUCH OF A CHOICE ON IN\nTERMS OF THEY DIDN'T HAVE LIKE A WIDE RANGE OF OTHER OPTIONS OUT\nTHERE. BUT WE ARE TOLD, NBC NEWS' KELLY\nO'DONNELL REPORTED FROM TWO SOURCES THAT JARED KUSHNER WAS\nBEHIND THIS PUSH. THAT'S INTERESTING GIVEN THE\nHISTORY BETWEEN JARED KUSHNER AND CHRIS CHRISTIE.\nIS IT GREAT OPTICS? NO, ESPECIALLY SINCE THERE'S THE\nTRIAL FOR BRIDGEGATE IS IMMINENT.\nBUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE EVERYDAY VOTER OUT THERE, THIS\nIDEA THAT BILL STEPIEN HAS COME ON BOARD IS SOMETHING THAT WILL\nPROBABLY GO OVER MOST PEOPLE'S HEADS.\nIT'S JUST IN THE WEEDS WHEN IT COMES TO POLITICS.\nMOST PEOPLE THAT WILL BE VOTING FOR DONALD TRUMP DON'T COME FROM\nTHE TRISTATE AREA. >>  WE ONLY HAVE 15 OR 20\nSECONDS. DO WE NOW HAVE AN ACTUAL TRUMP\nIMMIGRATION POLICY OR IS THAT STILL TBD?\n>> Reporter: NO. NO.\nI THINK THAT'S TBD. >> BIG SPEECH NEXT WEEK, RIGHT?\nWILL WE GET IT THEN, YOU THINK? >> Reporter: THAT'S WHAT HE\nSAYS. WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.\n>> ALL RIGHT.",

NIECE OF MARTIN LUTHER KING AND\nDAUGHTER OF REVEREND A.D. KING. WELCOME.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.\nARE EITHER OF THESE TWO CANDIDATES BIGOTS?\n>> WELL, I DON'T WANT TO DIRECTLY ACCUSE EITHER OF BEING\nA BIGOT, BUT I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR US AS VOTERS TO\nLOOK AT EACH PLATFORM THAT EACH PERSON REPRESENTS AND THEN TO\nALIGN OUR VOTES WITH THE PLATFORMS THAT ARE MOST\nSUITABLE, RATHER THAN THE PERSONALITY.\nWHEN THEY YELL AT EACH OTHER ABOUT BEING BIGOTS, I BELIEVE\nIT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO LISTEN TO, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO FOR\nME AS AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN IN AMERICA, A MATURE 65-YEAR-OLD\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN? WHAT WILL YOUR PLATFORM DO FOR\nME TODAY? AND THAT WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT.\nAS FAR AS WHO'S A RACIST AND WHO'S RILING UP PEOPLE TO HATE\nPEOPLE, I AM HEARING THAT FROM EVERY CORRIDOR FROM THE\nDEMOCRATS, THE REPUBLICANS, PEOPLE ARE BEING FEARFUL AND\nTEARFUL. AND SO IT'S GOING TO BE MORE\nIMPORTANT TO EXAMINE THOSE PLATFORMS.\n>> YOU HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE OF COLOR WATCHING THIS MUD SLINGING\nAND THEY'RE CONFUSED. BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND, THEY\nHEARD DONALD TRUMP THE OTHER DAY SAY SOMETHING THAT MAYBE STRUCK\nAT A FEW CHORDS HERE AND WAS ABLE TO REALLY TOUCH UPON\nSOMETHING AND THAT WAS MANY OF THE URBAN CENTERS HAVE TERRIBLE\nUNEMPLOYMENT, THEY DON'T GET GOOD EDUCATION, THEY'RE BEING\nSHOT AT. I'M USING CHICAGO AS AN EXAMPLE\nBUT WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN BALTIMORE AND SOME OTHER PLACES,\nSO QUOTE, HOW MUCH WORSE COULD IT GET?\nWHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? ON THE OTHER HAND, BILL CLINTON\nAND HILLARY CLINTON HAVE HAD A HISTORY OF BEING ABLE TO GO INTO\nCOMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND MAKE THEM FEEL LIKE THEY'RE BEING\nHEARD. SO WHICH SIDE IS ACTUALLY, AS\nYOU TALKED ABOUT, PUTTING FORTH THE BEST PLATFORM?\n>> I LIKE THE PLATFORM THAT SAYS, IN YOUR URBAN COMMUNITY,\nYOU NEED TO GO TO WORK, YOU NEED TO GO TO SCHOOL.\nYOU NEED TO BE HEALTHY IF YOU WANT TO GO TO CHURCH OR PRAY,\nYOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT. AND I LIKE THE OPPORTUNITIES\nTHAT ARE OFFERED, NOT JUST TO THE BLACK COMMUNITY BUT\nDEFINITELY TO THE BLACK COMMUNITY.\nI WOULD LIKE TO SEE OUR BLACK YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN GET OUT OF\nJAIL, GET BACK TO WORK AND GET BACK TO SCHOOL.\nIT SOUNDS VERY PROMISING, THE PLAN THAT MR. TRUMP IS\nPRESENTING FOR THE URBAN COMMUNITIES BECAUSE RIGHT NOW,\nMANY OF OUR URBAN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE KIND OF OVERRUN WITH\nDEMOCRAT LEADERS LIKE MAYORS AND ALL THAT KIND OF THING, THERE'S\nA LOT OF TROUBLE IN THOSE CITIES AND I BELIEVE WHICHEVER\nCANDIDATE WHO HAS THE PLATFORM THAT CAN PUT AMERICA BACK TO\nWORK, BACK TO CHURCH, BACK TO SCHOOL, AND MAKE US HEALTHY\nAGAIN, I BELIEVE THAT THAT'S AN EXCELLENT PLATFORM.\n>> FROM YOUR MOUTH TO GOD'S EARS, I HOPE WE SEE THAT SOON.

IT'S GETTING REALLY UGLY AND NOT\nSURE THIS IS GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY.\nWE'RE ALREADY WITH DIVISION AND IT CREATED WITH THESE POCKETS OF\nIDENTITY. NO HOPE FOR UNITY WHEN EVERYBODY\nIS PUSHING FOR DIVISION. I DON'T THINK TRUMP IS RACIST.\nTHE ONLY COLOR HE SEES IS GREEN.

IT USED TO BE THE LEFT TO SMEAR\nTHE RIGHT AS BEING BIGOT. I MEAN, THEY WOULD ALWAYS GET\nTHERE FIRST. THEY WOULD DO IT TO ROMNEY AND\nEVERYBODY. HE'S PLAYING THEIR GAME, SO NOW\nYOU HAVE SOMEBODY FROM THE RIGHT WHO'S FIGHTING THE SAME WAY THE\nLEFT FIGHTS AND WE'RE HEARING ABOUT WHAT AN OUTRAGE IS BUT\nSTILL THE RIGHT IS NOT AS DANGEROUS AS THE LEFT.\nTHERE ARE NO VIOLENT GROUPS. THERE ARE ACTIVISTS OCCUPYING\nSTREETS OR BLOCKING STREETS OR SPITTING ON PEOPLE OR\nENCOURAGING THE POLITICS OF LOOTING.\nSO I THINK THERE'S A BIT OF HYPOCRISY.\nEVERYBODY IS SCREAMING APOCALYPSE BECAUSE THE RIGHT\nHAPPENS TO BE AS BAD AS THE LEFT.\n>> HOW DOES THIS SET UP FOR THE DEBATES?\nWE'RE GOING INTO LABOR DAY OF NEXT, I'M ON VACATION NEXT WEEK,\nSO I'M THINKING WAY AHEAD TO LABOR DAY BUT OPINIONS ARE\nSTARTING TO HARDEN BUT THEN YOU SET UP TOWARDS THE DEBATES AND\nWHEN THEY GET TOGETHER, KIND OF AWKWARD.\nLIKE YOU'RE A RACIST. NO, YOU'RE A RACIST.\n>> I'M SURPRISED THEY RATCHETED UP THESE ATTACKS EARLY.\nI THOUGHT IT WOULD BE LATER IN THE CYCLE.\nUNLESS BOTH OF THEM HAVE A COUPLE OF THINGS.\nEACH HAS A THING THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT RIGHT NOW ON\nDONALD TRUMP'S SIDE.

NOW PROBABLY THE MOST DIVISIVE\nAND RACIALLY CHARGED AND VICIOUS ATTACK FROM A PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATE THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN AMERICAN HISTORY.\nIT IS LARGELY BECAUSE SHE HAS CLEARLY CONCLUDED THERE'S NO\nPOSITIVE RATIONAL FOR A CANDIDACY OTHER THAN SHE IS NOT\nDONALD TRUMP.

FROM FROM THE LAST EIGHT YEARS\nOF ESSENTIALLY OBAMA-CLINTON RULE.\n>> DOES DONALD TRUMP RUN THE RISK OF FALLING DOWN THE RABBIT\nHOLE IF HE TAKES THE BAIL OF THESE RACIST COMMENTEDS AND\nTHESE BARBS AND THE NAME-CALLING?\nDOES HE HAVE TO STEP BACK AND COME STRONG AGAIN WITH THE\nTELEPROMPTER AIDED SPEECHES. >> WE LEARN IN THE LAST THREE\nWEEKS AND YOU LOOK AT THE POLLING TRAJECTORIES -- THAT\nWHEN HE DOES SPEAK ABOUT ISSUES HE TENDS TO DO WELL.\nTHE MACRO DYNAMICS OF THE RACE ON ISSUES FAVOR HIS POSITIONS ON\nTHE ECONOMY, ON JOBS.

WE'RE -- OUR HEART RATE IS UP\nNOW. >> HILLARY CLINTON THE MEASURED\nPRESENTATION OF IT WOULD NOT GET YOU TO BELIEVE THE WORDS THAT\nWERE COMING OUT OF HER MOUTH, THAT WERE QUITE DIVISIVE.\n>> I THOUGHT HER LANGE -- LANGUAGE AND WHAT SHE SAID AS\nWONDERFUL. >> THE BLAMED DONALD TRUMP FOR\nTHE DIVISION IN AMERICAN POLITICS, WHICH IS RIDICULOUS.\nIF YOU LOOK AT EVERY MEASURE, EVERY STUDY, EVERY EIGHT YEARS\nOF BARACK OBAMA WE HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE O'ALREADYIZEED AND\nMORE DIVIDED AND THAT'S BECAUSE THAT'S BEEN PART OF HIS PLAYBOOK\nWHICH HE WAS USED EFFECTIVELY. >> CAN I TALK ABOUTING THE\nMONDAY. A MAN WHO IS NOT A POLITICIAN\nWHO HAS DROPPED SOME VERBAL BOMBS SINCE HE BECAME THE NUMBER\nONE CANDIDATE AMONG THE RUN REPUBLICS AND THEN YOU HAVE A\nWOMAN WHO HAS SO MANY MISSTEPS SHE HAS ROLLED OUT HER CAMPAIGN\nMORE THAN ONCE AND HAD TO DEAL WITH A SCANDAL THAT SHE HERSELF\nSAID WE WOULDN'T BE TALKING ABOUT, YET NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT\n15,000 MORE E-MAILS COMING OFF HER PRIVATE SERVER.\nNEITHER ONE OF THESE PEOPLE ARE LOVED, NOT EVEN LIKED.\n>> WHAT'S THAT'S WHY DONALD TRUMP HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO COME\nOUT AND SAY I HAVE THESE POLICIES AND --\n>> HE DID THAT. >> NO, HE HASN'T.\n>> SHE DID THAT TO SOME DEGREE YESTERDAY, TOO.\n>> SHE WIN -- >> SHE WENT OFF ON ONE TANGENT\nDO YOU THINK HE HAYS? >> NO.\n>> TALK BESIDE ISSUES. >> NO.\nI THINK THE TALKED ABOUT THE FEELINGS ON BOTH SIDES.\nPEOPLE ARE ANGRY ABOUT JOBS, PEOPLE ARE ANGRY ABOUT\nEDUCATION, DEBT, IMMIGRATION. THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT TERRORIST\nATTACKS. BUT WHAT HE HASN'T DONE IS\nHASN'T BEEN SAID, HERE ARE THE POLICIES ON HOW WE'RE GOING TO\nDEAL  -- >> HE JUST DID.\n>> BUILDING A WALL IS NOT A POLICY.\n>> HE SPEND THE LAST WEEK GOING OVER POLICY.\n>> I WANT TO TAKE OUR LEVEL OF VOLUME HERE DOWN A LITTLE BIT\nAND TALK ABOUT THE BRASS TACKS OFFING INS WHERE DONALD TRUMP\nHAS JUMPED IN AND I DON'T KNOW IF HILLARY CLINTON WILL FOLLOW\nHIM HERE. SHE MAY FEEL LIKE SHE NEEDS TO.\nHE IS TALKING ABOUT JOBS TO AT LEAST A COUPLE OF COMMUNITIES\nAND THOSE ARE COMMUNICATE OFFERED COLOR THIS WEEK.\nTALKING ABOUT BLACKS BLACKS ANDN AREAS ABOUT ONE COLOR AND THAT'S\nGREEN, ABOUT THE ECONOMY. AND THEN MEETING WITH HISPANIC\nLEADERS TODAY. SO I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU THINK\nABOUT THAT? I HEAR DEMOCRATS -- AND I KNOW\nTHE RHETORIC DO YOU GIVE CREDIT TO THE OTHER SIDE FOR JUMPING\nINTO THE DEEP END OF THE POOL WHICH IS A DIFFICULT PLACE FOR\nHIM TO BE? >> I JUST WANTS TO BY VERY\nCLEAR. I'M NOT SPEAKING BASED ON\nRHETORIC. I'M SPEAKING AS SOMEBODY WHO IS\nA LAWYER AND WHO HAS WORKED ON THE INNER CITY OF CHICAGO FOR\nTEN YEARS, AND SO BASED ON THAT, I THINK THAT IT'S WONDERFUL THAT\nHE IS GOING INTO THE INNER CITIES BECAUSE IT IS AN AREA\nTHAT IS HURTING.

SHE HAS DEVELOPED -- MADE HER\nWHOLE CAMPAIGN ABOUT INCLUSION AND STANDING TOGETHER AND\nOUTREACH. THIS ISSUE WAS LITIGATED IN THE\nPRIMARY WITH BERNIE SANDERS HAVING RAIDED THIS ISSUE AS\nWELL. I THINK THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nCOMMUNITY, YOUNG PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT'S NOT WHAT SHE\nIS ABOUT TODAY AND WILLING TO LOOK AT ACCEPTING AN APOLOGY FOR\nIT.

I'M SURE YOU SEE THAT WHEN YOU\nSEE WHAT'S HAPPENED THIS WEEK. >> I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE\nSAYING. I UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT\nRACE IT'S A VERY SENSITIVE ISSUE AND MAKES EVERYBODY VERY\nUNCOMFORTABLE. I THINK IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT\nFOR HILLARY CLINTON TO EXPOSE WHAT IS HAPPENING.\nPEOPLE BEFORE THIS WEEK DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THIS ALT-RIGHT\nMOVEMENT WAS. DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS ALIVE AND\nALIVE IN THE CAMPAIGN OF A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.\nTHAT EXPOSURE NEEDS TO HAPPEN BECAUSE SUNLIGHT IS THE BEST\nDISI DISINFECTANT.\nI'M PROUD SHE USED THAT. SHE USED DONALD TRUMP'S OWN\nWORDS OR USED THE HEADLINES OF THE CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN THAT HE\nHAS CHOSEN TO RUN HIS CAMPAIGN. WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS DOING, ON\nTHE OTHER HAND, IN CALLING HER DIRECTLY A BIGOT OR IN PUTTING\nUP ADS OF SOMETHING SHE SAID 20 YEARS.\nI KNOW IT'S POLITICS. ALL OF THAT IS FAIR GAME.\nIT'S A DIFFERENCE IN KIND COMPARED TO WHAT SHE'S DONE.\nI THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO EXPOSE IT AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET ON\nBETTER FOOTING AND TALK ABOUT THE POLICIES THAT WILL HELP ALL\nOF OUR CITIZENS. I DO THINK THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT\nMOMENT FOR THE CAMPAIGN. >> SHE USED IT AS SHE WAS\nSTRUGGLING WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nWAS THIS A WAY TO DISTRACT FROM THAT?\n>> NOT AT ALL. THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT CAME UP\nAS OF WHAT DONALD TRUMP HAD DONE BY PUTTING STEVE BANNON IN HIS\nCAMPAIGN. THIS IS WHY FOLKS ON THE RIGHT,\nREASONABLE REPUBLICANS ARE NOT STANDING UP TO DEFEND HIM AND\nNOT STANDING UP TO DEFEND STEVE BANNON.\nTHERE WAS A HUGE AMOUNT OF CONCERN OF THE REPUBLICANS WHEN\nHE PUT THAT GUY IN THERE BECAUSE THEY KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE\nREPRESENTED. THIS WAS NOT ABOUT A DEFLECTION.\nTHIS WAS ABOUT TELLING IT LIKE IT IS WHICH IS WHAT DONALD TRUMP\nIS DOING TO HIS CAMPAIGN. >> STICK AROUND WITH ME.\nI'M GOING TO GET A QUICK BREAK.

HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN DMINT THAT HE\nWANTS IMMIGRATION REFORM, HE HAS DRIVEN THAT ISSUE AS A\nCANDIDATE. HE SAID TO ENFORCE --\nCONSISTENTLY ENFORCE EXISTING LAWS, AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT\nHILLARY CLINTON AND SOME OF THE DEMOCRATS SEEM TO MISS.\nWHEN YOU HAVE ILLEGAL WORKERS IN THE COUNTRY THEY UNDER MINE THE\nWAGE SCALE. YOU HAVE TO ENFORCE LAWS THAT\nPREVENT EMPLOYERS FROM HIRING ILLEGALS.\n>> BUT ALLOWING SUMMON WHO IS UNDOCUMENTED AND IN THE COUNTRY.\nWHEN HE TALKED ABOUT A SOFTENNING ON THAT DEMAND, HOW\nIS THAT ANY DIVT THAN PUTTING AMNESTY ON THE TABLE?\n>> HE WANTS TO START WITH THE BAD GUYS, AND REMEMBER BARACK\nOBAMA DEPORTED 500,000 ILLEGALS HIMSELF.\nBARACK OBAMA, HALF A MILLION PEOPLE.\nTHAT SF A SIZE OF A LARGE CITY. BUT THE REALITY IS THAT LET'S\nSTART WITH THE BAD FOLKS FIRST, WORK OUR WAY DOWN, PROTECT\nAMERICAN JOBS AND WORKERS ALONG THE WAY.\nBUT I WILL SAY THIS. IF IMMIGRATION REFORM WAS EASY,\nCONGRESS WOULD HAVE GET WITH IT 15 YEARS AGO.\nRONALD REAGAN HAD THE LAST MAJOR REFORM LAW.\nIT IS A DIFFICULT ISSUE. I THINK WE HAVE TO CREDIT DONALD\nTRUMP FOR MAKING IT AN ISSUE. TALKING ABOUT BRINGING IN\n620,000 REFUGEES, UNVETTED -- >> HE IS TALKING ABOUT, HE IS\nCRITICIZED PRESIDENT OBAMA AS BASICALLY BEING UNKIND OR\nLACKING COMPASSION, BUT HE SAYS HE WOULD DO THE SAME BUT WITH\nMORE ENERGY. CAN YOU JUST SORT OF CONCISELY\nEXPLAIN WHAT HIS PLAN IS? >> HE IS SAYING, ENFORCE\nEXISTING LAWS. THAT IS THE BIGGEST CRITICISM.\nNOT ONLY OF PRESIDENT OBAMA, BUT PRESIDENT BUSH AS WELL.\nTHE INCONSISTENT ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULE OF HAU IN THE UNITED\nSTATES OF AMERICA. YOU WILL HAVE MORE DEPORTATION.\n>> HOW ARE YOU HOW ARE YOU SAYING --\n>> SOMETIMES HE DOES, SOMETIMES HE DOESN'T.\nWHEN A CITY SAYS COME HERE IF YOU'RE ILLEGAL, WE WILL NOT\nPROSECUTE YOU.

CERTAINLY, THERE'S A LOT OF\nRESCUE CRUISE OUT HERE. BIG ASSETS OUT HERE AS WELL,\nINCLUDING DOGS. TRYING TO SEE UNDER THE RUBBLE.\nUNFORTUNATELY IN THOSE CASES ALL THEY CAN RETRIEVE IS DEAD\nBODIES. I WANT TO SHOW YOU WHY.\nTHIS IS ONE OF THE HOUSES, ONE OF THE BIG HOUSES THAT CAME DOWN\nIN THE EARTHQUAKE. FINDING SOMEBODY ALIVE IN\nSOMETHING LIKE THAT. SURVIVING THAT WOULD REALLY HAVE\nTO BE A STROKE OF LUCK. THAT'S WHAT MANY BUILDINGS IN\nTHIS TOWN LOOK LIKE. WE'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT THE\nAFTERSHOCKS HERE. THIS IS REALLY PROBABLY THE\nBIGGEST RISK TO THE RESCUE AND RECOVERY EFFORTS GOING ON RIGHT\nHERE. I WANT TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO\nSOMETHING. YOU SEE THAT ANCIENT CHURCH\nTOWER OVER THERE MADE OF STONE. THAT HAS MAJOR CRACKS IN IT\nALREADY. AUTHORITIES FEAR THAT COULD COME\nDOWN IF THERE IS ANOTHER MAJOR AFTERSHOCK.\nAND WE'VE HAD HUNDREDS OF AFTERSHOCKS THAT HAVE DONE\nEXACTLY THAT. THEY'VE BROUGHT BUILDINGS THAT\nHAVE HAD DAMAGE DOWN COMPLETELY. EVERY TIME THAT HAPPENS.\nTHE RESCUE CREWS NEED TO STOP THEIR WORKING AND EVACUATE\nIMMEDIATELY BECAUSE OF COURSE, ALL OF THE OTHER RUBBLE THERE\nSTARTS SHIFTING AS WELL. AND THEY'RE IN DANGER OF GETTING\nBURIED THEMSELVES. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT WORK FOR THE\nRESCUE CREWS. THEY'RE TRYING TO BRING IN MORE\nASSETS. AND TAKING CARE OF THOSE\nRESCUED. I CAN TELL FROM YOU PLACE LIKE\nAMATRICE HERE, THE MOST AFFECTED TOWN, PRETTY MUCH OTHER FAMILY\nHAVING PEOPLE TRAUMATIZED AND VERY MUCH AFRAID OF THESE VERY\nSTRONG AFTERSHOCKS HAPPENING AS WELL, CHRISTI.\n>> ESPECIALLY FROM THE 2100 PEOPLE WITH THE MAKESHIFT TENTS\nARE YOU GETTING ANY INDICATION AS TO WHERE THOSE PEOPLE WILL\nGO, LIVING IN THOSE CONDITIONS? >> Reporter: YEAH.\nYOU KNOW, THAT IS -- IT'S ACTUALLY A REAL BIG DEBATE HERE\nIN ITALY RIGHT NOW AS TO HOW YOU MOVE FORWARD FROM SOMETHING LIKE\nTHIS, A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE, MORE THAN 2,000 PEOPLE HAVE LOST\nTHEIR HOMES. A LOT OF THEM AT THIS POINT IN\nTIME ARE AFRAID TO STAY IN ANY HARD STRUCTURES BECAUSE OF THE\nAFTERSHOCKS GOING ON. IN THE LONG TERM, THE QUESTION\nIS GOING TO BE WITH SOME OF THESE VILLE AVENUES.\nARE YOU GOING TO REBUILD THEM WHERE PER BEFORE, ON A SEISMIC\nFAULT LINE, WHERE YOU HAVE THE EARTHQUAKES WHERE THAT HAPPENS.\nAUTHORITIES ARE SAYING MAYBE SOME OF THESE VILLAGES MAY HAVE\nTO BE GIVEN UP COMPLETELY AND THEY MAY HAVE TO RELOCATE THESE\nPEOPLE TO OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.\nTHAT'S THE LONG-TERM THINKING. THEY SAY THEY WANT TO REBUILD\nALL OF THIS BUT THAT'S A DISCUSSION GOING ON RIGHT NOW.\nTHIS AREA IS CALLED AN EMERGENCY AREA, THEREFORE, FUNDING IS\nAVAILABLE TO HELP THE MOST IMMEDIATE NEEDS.\nBUT FOR THE LONG TERM, THERE'S VERY BIG QUESTIONS THAT THE\nITALIAN POLITICIANS AND ITALIAN SOCIETY ARE GOING TO ASK\nTHEMSELVES WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO WITH PLACES LIKE THIS WHICH\nARE VERY ANCIENT, VERY BEAUTIFUL BUT ALSO VERY PRONE TO SEISMIC\nACTIVITY. >> FRED PLEITGEN, THANK YOU SO\nMUCH FOR BRINGING THAT. >> FOR WAYS TO HELP EARTHQUAKE\nVICTIMS VISIT CNN.COM/IMPACT.",

THERE WAS ONE THAT WAS 5.5\nMAGNITUDE. SO, THERE'S THAT FEAR.\nTHERE'S, OF COURSE, THE GREAT LOSS THAT'S HAPPENED.\nAND THEN, OF COURSE, FOR A LOT OF THESE FOLKS, THERE'S ALSO THE\nMATERIAL LOSS AS WELL. A LOT OF THE BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN\nDESTROYED. A LOT OF THE HISTORIC BUILDINGS\nIN TOWN, AND SOME OF THESE SMALLER TOWNS WONDER WHY THESE\nPLACES ARE STILL VIABLE TO LIVE IN AT ALL.\nWHETHER OR NOT THEY MIGHT HAVE TO BE ABANDONED.\nIT'S A HUGE LOSS FOR THE COMMUNITY.\nOBVIOUSLY, A HUGE LOSS FOR ITALY.\nAT THE SAME TIME, I HAVE TO SAY THE RESPONSE TIME BY THE ITALIAN\nRESCUES ARE VERY IMPORTANT.

I THINK IT'S A VERY REAL ISSUE.\n>> LARRY, LET'S TALK NUMBERS. YOU ARE SO GOOD EIAT IT.\nYOU ARE A PRO. A NEW POLL SHOWING HILLARY\nCLINTON HOLDING HER POST CONVENTION BOUNCE WITH A SEVEN\nPOINT LEAD IN A FOUR WAY MATCHUP AND TEN POINT LEAD IN A TWO WAY\nMATCHUP. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THESE\nNUMBERS, LARRY? >> WELL, THE NUMBERS CHANGE OVER\nTIME BUT BASICALLY, I THINK IT'S GOING TO BOUNCE AROUND BETWEEN\nTHE FOUR POINTS THAT BARACK OBAMA WON BY IN 2012 AND THE\nSEVEN POINTS HE WON BY IN 2008. THE BASIC ALIGNMENTS THAT WE\nHAVE SEEN IN THE PAST TWO PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS ARE STILL\nPRESENT. HILLARY CLINTON HAS SOME PLUSES\nTHAT BARACK OBAMA DOESN'T HAVE. SHE HAS SOME MINUSES THAT BARACK\nOBAMA DOESN'T HAVE OR DIDN'T HAVE IN THOSE TWO CAMPAIGNS.\nI THINK IT IS A VERY GOOD LEAD FOR HER.\nI WOULD NEVER SAY BEFORE LABOR DAY IT'S ABSOLUTELY SOLID BUT I\nWILL TELL YOU, I HEAR THE CONCRETE SETTING, IF YOU CAN\nHEAR CONCRETE SETTING. ESPECIALLY WITH MINORITY VOTERS,\nBUT ALSO WITH A LOT OF THE REST OF THE ELECTORATE.\n>> YEAH. YOU CAN'T HEAR IT BUT THERE'S A\nTIME BEFORE IT SETS WHEN YOU CAN MARK YOUR NAME IN IT OR WRITE IN\nIT AND AFTER THAT IT'S ALL DONE. I HAVE BEEN WANTING TO TALK TO\nYOU ABOUT THIS. THERE'S THIS NOTION OF THE SHY\nOR UNDERCOVER TRUMP VOTER THAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT,\nSOMEONE WHO DOESN'T WANT TO TELL A POLLSTER ON THE PHONE THEY ARE\nSUPPORTING DONALD TRUMP. THEY CALL IT SOCIAL DESIRABILITY\nBIAS. TELL ME MORE ABOUT THIS.\nDOES THIS RING TRUE? BECAUSE HIS OWN CAMPAIGN MANAGER\nIS SAYING HEY, WE ARE GETTING THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T NECESSARILY\nWANT TO SAY THEY ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP IN THE\nPOLLING. >> BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I FIRST\nHEARD ABOUT THIS IN 1968. IT WASN'T CALLED THE SHY VOTE\nBACK THEN BUT IT WAS ABOUT GEORGE WALLACE, WHETHER PEOPLE\nWOULD BE HONEST IN TALKING TO INTERVIEWERS EITHER IN PERSON OR\nON TELEPHONE. OBVIOUSLY THERE WAS NO ONLINE\nPOLLING BACK IN 1968. GENERALLY SPEAKING, WHEN YOU\nHAVE A CONTROVERSIAL CANDIDATE ON THE RIGHT OR THE LEFT, THE\nTHEORY GOES THAT THERE WILL BE A PERCENT OR TWO OR THREE THAT\nSIMPLY WON'T WANT TO ADMIT IT. NOW, THEY ALMOST NEVER SAY THEY\nARE VOTING FOR THE OTHER CANDIDATE.\nWHAT THEY SAY IS THEY ARE UNDECIDED.\nIS IT POSSIBLE THAT THERE IS SOME OF THAT HERE, YES.\nDO I THINK IT'S SUBSTANTIAL ENOUGH TO WIPE OUT THE VERY\nLARGE LEAD THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS IN THE BIG SWING STATES?\nNO. WE BORROWED SOME OF THIS FROM\nBRITISH POLITICS. IT'S CALLED THE SHY TORY VOTE\nOVER THERE. IT SEEMS TO HAVE MORE IMPACT IN\nBRITAIN THAN IT DOES HERE. >> WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS,\nMICHAEL? >> I HAVE SEEN IT IN BLACK-WHITE\nELECTIONS. I HAPPENED TO BE IN CALIFORNIA\nWHEN MAYOR TOM BRADLEY WAS UPSET.\nMANY CALLED IT THE BRADLEY EFFECT.\nI HAVE SEEN IT IN RACIALLY CHARGED ENVIRONMENTS.\nTHE REASON THAT I'M DUBIOUS IN THIS CASE, LARRY'S A BRIGHT GUY,\nHE CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, I DON'T REMEMBER THIS BEING A\nFACTOR IN PRIMARY AND CAUCUS SEASON.\nI DON'T REMEMBER SITTING THERE ON CNN ON ELECTION NIGHTS SAYING\nOH, MY GOD, LOOK AT TRUMP, HE OUTPOLLED WHERE WE EXPECTED THAT\nHE WOULD BE. SO MY SUSPICION AT PRESENT IS\nTHAT IT'S A WAY TO KEEP THE TRUMP SUPPORTERS IN THE TENT AS\nTHESE POLLING NUMBERS ARE COMING OUT AND SHOWING A WIDENING GAP.\nTHEY NEED TO RALLY THE TROOPS AND MAKE THEM THINK ALL HOPE IS\nNOT LOST. >> GO AHEAD, LARRY.\n>> YES. MICHAEL HAS GOOD MEMORY, BECAUSE\nTHE SO-CALLED BRADLEY EFFECT, OF COURSE, BRADLEY WAS AN\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR.\nHE HAD BEEN LEADING IN ALL THE POLLS AND HE WAS UPSET IN HIS\nRACE FOR GOVERNOR IN THE 1980s, AND LATER THAT SAME DECADE, WE\nHAD DOUG WILDER IN VIRGINIA WHO WAS WAY AHEAD IN THE POLLS,\nSOMETIMES BY 10, 12, 14 PERCENTAGE POINTS AND HE WON BY\nI BELIEVE 6,000 VOTES OUT OF NEARLY TWO MILLION CAST.\nSO YES, ON THE RACIAL SIDE, IT CAN BE THERE.\nI DON'T FEEL THAT IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE.\n>> EVEN THOUGH RACE HAS BEEN DISCUSSED SO MUCH, IT'S NOT\nBLACK-WHITE BUT STILL, RACE HAS BEEN DISCUSSED.\nTHAT'S WHAT THEY'RE FIGHTING OVER RIGHT NOW.\nSTILL YOU DON'T SEE IT? >> I'LL TELL YOU ANOTHER REASON\nWHY I DON'T SEE IT. THE AMERICAN ELECTORATE HAS\nCHANGED DRAMATICALLY. AFRICAN-AMERICANS, HISPANIC\nAMERICANS, ASIAN AMERICANS AND OTHER MINORITIES WILL BE 30%,\n30% OF THE NOVEMBER VOTE AND BECAUSE OF THE THINGS DONALD\nTRUMP HAS SAID AND DONE, AND ALSO BECAUSE OF HILLARY\nCLINTON'S RECORD THAT THEY HAVE INTERPRETED AS BEING\nPRO-MINORITY, I THINK DONALD TRUMP IS HEADED FOR AN ALL-TIME\nLOW AT LEAST IN THE MODERN ERA FOR REPUBLICANS.\nHE WILL BE LUCKY, LUCKY, TO GET 20% OF ALL MINORITIES COMBINED\nAND I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE CLOSER TO 15% WHICH MEANS HE HAS\nTO GET A MASSIVE MAJORITY OF WHITES AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S\nTHERE FOR HIM EITHER. >> MICHAEL, YOUR LISTENERS\nTALKING ABOUT THIS, ESPECIALLY THIS SO-CALLED SHY VOTE AND\nWHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE MADE UP THEIR MIND, BLACK OR WHITE OR\nHISPANIC OR ASIAN, ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON?\n>> IT'S AWFULLY DIFFICULT TO FIND FOLKS WHO CALL MY PROGRAM\nAND SAY THEY ARE UNDECIDED. IF I CAN JUST ECHO SOMETHING\nLARRY SAID. HERE'S THE DATA POINT I COME\nBACK TO. IN THE '92 RACE, GEORGE HERBERT\nWALKER BUSH GOT 59% OF THE WHITE VOTE.\nTHAT EQUATED TO 426 ELECTORAL VOTES.\nMITT ROMNEY IN THE LAST CYCLE GOT THE SAME PERCENTAGE, 59% OF\nTHE WHITE VOTE. IT GOT HIM 206 ELECTORAL VOTES.\nWHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU? IT'S A DIFFERENT COUNTRY.\nTHE DEMOGRAPHICS HAVE SHIFTED. AND YOU CAN'T GET ELECTED ON\nWHITE VOTES ALONE.",

NOT SURE WHY YOU WOULD BLEACH\nTHOSE E-MAILS AND THAT I CAN SURE THEY WERE NEVER\nRECOVERABLE.

A PERSON WHO IS VERY FLAT\nCHESTED IS VERY HARD TO BE A 10. YOU KNOW, IT REALLY DOESN'T\nMATTER WHAT THEY WRITE, AS LONG AS YOU'VE GOT A YOUNG AND\nBEAUTIFUL PIECE OF -- YOU KNOW, SO ON AND SO FORTH.\nSO WOMEN HAVE ALREADY ADOPTED AND ACCEPTED AND INTERNALIZED\nTHE NOTION THAT DONALD TRUMP IS A MISOGYNIST.\nTHAT'S WHAT IT POLLING IS REFLECTING.\n>> MAYOR NUTTER, DO YOU SEE THIS OLD CHARGE AS SOMETHING\nDEMOCRATS WILL TRY TO USE AGAINST --\n>> IT'S JUST A PART OF THE GENERAL NARRATIVE THAT'S OUT\nTHERE. DONALD TRUMP ALREADY HAS A\nPROBLEM WITH WOMEN. IT SHOULD BE ACKNOWLEDGED.\nIT'S NOT JUST, YOU KNOW, IT'S A BAD THING, OR IT'S ALMOST\nALWAYS -- IT'S ALWAYS UNACCEPTABLE FOR DOMESTIC\nVIOLENCE, IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE OR SITUATION.\nDONALD TRUMP SHOULD SAY THAT. MR. BANNON SHOULD SAY THAT.\nAND THEN MOVE ON. AND UNFORTUNATELY, MANY CASES\nARE DROPPED. AND THIS ONE, BECAUSE HIS\nEX-WIFE DID NOT SHOW UP.

TRUMP WAS RUNNING FOR OFFICE, FOR WHATEVER REASON,\nTHERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR IT. BUT LET'S LOOK AT THE HILLARY\nCLINTON CAMP. LET'S LOOK AT THE SEXISM THAT\nEXISTS NOT MAYBE FROM THE MEN IN HER OFFICE, BUT FROM THE WOMEN.\nHUMA ABEDIN, FOR 12 YEARS, SHE WAS THE EDITOR OF THE JOURNAL OF\nMUSLIM MINORITY AFFAIRS AND EDITED AND WROTE ARTICLES ABOUT\nWOMEN WHO WERE INVITING RAPE BY THE CLOTHES THEY WERE WEARING.\nTHAT SHE BLAMED 911 ON U.S. MUSLIMS.\nWORKING GAY FAMILIES SHOULD NOT BE RECOGNIZED AS ACTUAL\nFAMILIES. AND SAT THERE AND SAID THAT\nWOMEN -- AND ACTUALLY CRITICIZED HILLARY CLINTON AND HER IDEA OF\nENCOURAGING WOMEN WAS ACTUALLY ANTI-FEMININE AND THAT WAS NOT\nRIGHT FOR THE FAMILY. THIS IS HILLARY CLINTON'S CLOSE\nADVISER. >> SAYING HILLARY CLINTON IS\nANTI-WOMEN? >> HUMA ABEDIN, IF YOU LOOK AT\nTHE WRITINGS SHE HAS, THAT GOES EXACTLY OPPOSITE OF WHAT HILLARY\nCLINTON HAS SAID. >> THERE'S NO POSSIBILITY THAT\nHUMA ABEDIN OR HILLARY CLINTON --\n>> BUT SHE WROTE THOSE THINGS! >> LET HER RESPOND.\n>> IT DEPENDS ON WHAT -- >> LET HIM RESPOND.\nONE AT A TIME.

IT'S BLACK AND WHITE --\n>> LET'S PUT ASIDE HUMA AND STEVE BANNON.\nTHE POLLING JOHN KING IS SHOWING IS SHOWING WOMEN'S PERCEPTIONS\nOF DONALD TRUMP -- >> WHO IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.\n>> AND HE HAVE MADE A DECISION, CLEARLY, BY THAT POLLING IN THE\nSWING STATES, BY WHAT JOHN KING IS TALKING ABOUT, THEY HAVE MADE\nTHE OBSERVATION AND THE DECISION THAT DONALD TRUMP IS A\nMISOGYNIST. AND ALL THE PEOPLE THAT HE DRAWS\nIN, WHETHER IT BE ROGER AILES, THAT'S KIND OF HIS CULTURE.\nTHAT'S -- >> -- BUT CAN WE POINT OUT THE\nWOMEN HERE? >> -- ARE REJECTING DONALD\nTRUMP. >> WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE\nCANDIDATE IF YOU DON'T SUPPORT HILLARY CLINTON THAT THERE'S A\nSPECIAL PLACE IN HELL FOR THOSE WOMEN THAT CAME FROM ANOTHER ONE\nOF THOSE SENIOR ADVISERS. >> WHICH SHE APOLOGIZED FOR.\n>> OH, APOLOGIES MAKE IT ALL BETTER.\nIT'S IN BLACK -- >> HOLD ON, THIS IS MY TURN TO\nTALK NOW. THIS IS MY TURN TO RESPOND.\nTHIS IS IN BLACK AND WHITE WRITING.\nSHE EDITED. NOW YOU HAVE THIS COMMENT.\nYES, YOU CAN SAY I'M SORRY, BUT IT'S STILL OUT THERE, AND THAT\nREALLY HURT THE BERNIE SANDERS CAMP.\nTHAT WAS A DIRECT AGAINST WOMEN IN THE BERNIE SANDERS CAMP.\nSO A LOT OF THOSE VOTES, I'LL GIVE HER CREDIT --\n>> LET'S MOVE ON TO IMMIGRATION --\n>> BECAUSE SHE'S A WOMAN. >> LET'S MOVE ON TO IMMIGRATION\nHERE. I DO WANT TO GET THIS IN.\nBECAUSE DONALD TRUMP HAS MADE SOME NEW COMMENTS TONIGHT ON\nFOX. I WANT TO PLAY THEM AND TALK TO\nYOU AND KAYLEIGH. LET'S PLAY THAT.\nPLAY IT. >> ONCE THE BORDER IS SECURED\nAND WE GET RID OF THE CRIMINAL ELEMENTS, WHICH I'M GOING TO\nSTART BEFORE THE WALL, BEFORE ANYTHING, WE'RE GOING TO START\nTHAT DAY ONE, WE WILL LOOK INTO VARIOUS SITUATIONS IS.\nBUT, AGAIN, PEOPLE ARE HERE ILLEGALLY.\nAND WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT. THEY'RE HERE ILLEGALLY.\nSO WE WILL SEE WHAT WE WILL SEE. BUT WE'RE GOING TO START OFF BY\nSECURING THE BORDER, BY GETTING RID OF THE HORRIBLE CRIMINAL\nELEMENT THAT'S CAUSING TREMENDOUS HAVOC, DRUG DEALERS,\nGANG MEMBERS, ET CETERA. AND I THINK PEOPLE WILL BE\nEXTREMELY HAPPY. AND I'LL BE ANNOUNCING SOMETHING\nWITHIN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS. A VERY COMPREHENSIVE PLAN ON\nIMMIGRATION. >> I MEAN, KAYLEIGH, OBVIOUSLY,\nTHERE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A SPEECH ABOUT THIS ALREADY.\nDONALD TRUMP LAST NIGHT TOLD ME IT WILL BE NEXT WEEK.\nNOW IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE TWO WEEKS FROM NOW.\nCLEARLY, THEY ARE TRYING TO FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.\nTHEY ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEIR PLAN, AT LEAST FOR\nTHE 11 MILLION OR HOWEVER MANY IT IS UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS IN\nTHIS COUNTRY. DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT?\nTHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT TO DO ABOUT\nTHAT? >> WELL, I THINK IN SOME CASES,\nYOU'RE RIGHT. BECAUSE HE'S TRYING TO LISTEN TO\nVOTERS, WHICH I THINK SHOULD BE THE GOAL OF ANY PERSON RUNNING\nFOR OFFICE. YOU KNOW, HE MENTIONED IN HIS\nHANNITY TOWN HALL, I THOUGHT THIS WAS A GREAT MOMENT WHEN HE\nSAID, VOTERS ARE COMING TO ME AND TELLING ME THEY DON'T LIKE\nTHIS PART OF MY POLICY. SO HE'S TRYING TO LISTEN AND BE\nRESPONSIVE, WHICH IS GOOD. BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO SAY, THESE\nTHINGS HAVE NOT CHANGED. HE IS THE SECURITY CANDIDATE\nWHEN IT COMES TO IMMIGRATION. HE IS GOING TO SEND -- NO ONE'S\nGOING TO HAVE CITIZENSHIP HERE UNLESS THEY GO HOME FIRST --\n>> BUT THIS CLOSE TO AN ELECTION, SHOULD A -- YOU KNOW,\nTHE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT STILL BE UNSURE OF\nEXACTLY THE PARAMETERS OF WHAT THEIR MAJOR POLICY, WHICH THEY\nRAN ON, QUITE STRONGLY? >> I THINK HE'S VERY CLEAR.\nAND I THINK RIGHT NOW HE'S ESTABLISHING PRIORITIES.\nAND YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU LOOK AT HEALTH CARE, FOR INSTANCE, YOU\nHAVE CERTAIN PRIORITIES. AND FOR DONALD TRUMP, HIS\nPRIORITY IS, ONE, THE WALL. MEXICO'S PAYING FOR IT.\nTWO, EVERYONE'S GOING HOME AND THEY'RE GOING TO COME IN THE\nRIGHT WAY. THREE, WE'RE DEPORTING\nCRIMINALS. FOUR, WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THE\nPEOPLE WHO REMAIN. SO HE'S ESTABLISHING PRIORITIES\nNOW. AND I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING.\n>> MAYOR NUTTER, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE\nTHIS CLOSE TO ELECTION DAY -- >> HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY'RE\nTALKING ABOUT? >> -- TALKING ABOUT WHAT MY\nPOLICY IS. >> LISTENING TO THE VOTERS IS\nONE THING. HAVING A ROCK SOLID POLICY AND\nSOME PRINCIPLES IS ANOTHER THING.\nWHAT'S CLEAR HERE IS, HE DOES NOT HAVE A ROCK-SOLID POLICY AND\nPRINCIPLES. HE'LL LISTEN TO VOTERS UP TO\nNOVEMBER 7th. AND THERE MIGHT BE A DIFFERENT\nSTORY ON THAT PARTICULAR DAY. AT SOME POINT IN TIME IN THIS\nBUSINESS, WITH RUNNING FOR OFFICE, YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO\nKNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND TAKE A STAND ON IT.\nYOU CAN LISTEN TO PEOPLE, BUT YOU'VE DRAWN YOUR PARAMETERS AND\nDONALD TRUMP HAS NO IDEA WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.\n>> WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM MORE OF OUR PANELISTS ON THIS ISSUE\nTONIGHT, INCLUDING FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, JOHN\nKASICH. HE'S GOING TO JOIN US.\nHE CONFRONTED DONALD TRUMP ON IMMIGRATION DURING THE CAMPAIGN.\nTHE QUESTION IS, WHAT DOES HE THINK OF WHAT TRUMP IS SAYING\nNOW.",

HERE'S WHAT SHE SAID ON MSNBC.\n>> I AM REACHING OUT TO EVERYONE.\nREPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS, INDEPENDENTS.\nEVERYONE WHO IS AS TROUBLED AS I AM BY THE BIGOTRY AND\nDIVISIVENESS OF DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN.\nAND I'VE SAID REPEATEDLY, THIS IS NOT A NORMAL CHOICE BETWEEN A\nREPUBLICAN AND A DEMOCRAT. WE ARE FACING A DIVISIVE\nCANDIDATE, WHOSE LOOSE CANNON TEMPERAMENT AND HIS COMPLETE\nLACK OF PREPARATION MAKE HIM UNQUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT AND\nTEMPERAMENTALLY UNFIT TO BE COMMANDER IN CHIEF.\n>> SHE'S TRYING TO MAKE THE MOST OF THE FACT THAT DONALD TRUMP IS\nHAVING TROUBLE REACHING WOMEN AND MINORITIES.\nTHE POLLS BEAR THAT OUT. AND NOW TRUMP IS ALSO AT RISK OF\nBECOMING THE FIRST REPUBLICAN IN 60 YEARS TO LOSE THE VOTES OF\nANOTHER DEMOGRAPHIC, WHITE COLLEGE-EDUCATED VOTERS.\nJOHN KING JOINS ME AGAIN TO BREAK DOWN BY THE NUMBERS.\nSO CAN TRAUMP TURN THE TIDE ON THIS PARTICULAR DEMOGRAPHIC?\n>> HE NEEDS TO, ANDERSON, IF HE'S GOING TO BE COMPETITIVE AND\nWIN THE ELECTION. WE'VE DONE THIS BEFORE WHEN YOU\nGET NEW DATA, YOU LOOK AT IT. IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THAT\nDONALD TRUMP IS IMPROVING? LOOK RIGHT NOW, AMONG WHITE\nCOLLEGE GRADUATES, DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON ESSENTIALLY\nRUNNING EVEN, 41% FOR DONALD TRUMP, 40% FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nYOU SEE THE THIRD PARTY CANDIDATES GETTING A A COMBINED\n16% RIGHT HERE. ROUGHLY EVEN, RIGHT.\nLOOK AT THIS. MITT ROMNEY LOST IN 2012.\nHE BEAT PRESIDENT OBAMA BY 14 POINTS AMONG WHITE COLLEGE\nGRADUATES. HE WON BY 14 POINTS AND HE LOST\nTHE ELECTION. DONALD TRUMP RUNNING ABOUT EVEN\nRIGHT NOW. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY AT HOME\nNEEDS ME TO EXPLAIN, IF YOU ARE RUNNING -- IF YOU'RE DONALD\nTRUMP, YOU'RE RUNNING 15 POINTS AMONG WHITE COLLEGE GRADS BEHIND\nTHE GUY WHO LOST IN 2012, THAT'S NOT GOOD.\n>> NATIONAL NUMBERS ARE OBVIOUSLY ONE THING.\nYOU KNOW, ELECTIONS ARE WON IN BATTLEGROUND STATES.\nWHERE DOES THE EDUCATION GAP FOR TRUMP WORK MOST TO HILLARY\nCLINTON'S ADVANTAGE? >> MOST IN THE STATES I CALL THE\nNEW AMERICA STATES. STATES THAT HAVE GROWING\nDIVERSITY, GROWING LATINO COMMUNITY BHAIB A BIG\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY. BUT ALSO WHERE THE NEW ECONOMY\nIS A HIGHER-EDUCATED ECONOMY. TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING,\nRESEARCH, MEDICAL, A PLACE LIKE COLORADO.\nTHE DENVER SUBURBS, WHO HAVE A GROWING LATINO POPULATION, BUT\nALSO GROWING NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE, WHO HAVE\nCOLLEGE GRADUATIONS. WHITE COLLEGE GRADS IN COLORADO,\n58% TO 33%. YOU CAN DO THE MATH AT HOME.\n25-POINT LEAD FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nMITT ROMNEY BEAT PRESIDENT OBAMA ON ELECTION DAY 2012 BY 11\nPOINTS AND MITT ROMNEY LOST THE STATE.\nHE BEAT PRESIDENT OBAMA AMONG WHITE COLLEGE GRADUATES, BUT\nLOST THE STATE. DONALD TRUMP IS LOSING BY MORE\nTHAN 20 POINTS, ANDERSON, IN COLORADO.\nA SWING STATE THAT APPEARS TO BE MOVING OUT OF REACH FOR THE\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN. LET'S LOOK AT VIRGINIA.\nANOTHER ONE, WHERE TODAY, CLINTON IS AHEAD OF DONALD TRUMP\nBY 18 POINTS THERE. AGAIN, GOVERNOR ROMNEY LOST BUT\nWON THE STATE. A NEW ECONOMY STATE.\nBUT EVEN IN TRADITIONAL BATTLEGROUND STATES.\nLOOK AT IOWA. NOW, IOWA WAS ALWAYS GOOD FOR\nPRESIDENT OBAMA. BUT IT'S A WHITER, MORE\nCONSERVATIVE STATE. IT'S VERY COMPETITIVE RIGHT NOW.\nESSENTIALLY A DEAD HEAT BETWEEN TRUMP AND CLINTON.\nSHE'S UP TEN POINTS AMONG WHITE COLLEGE GRADUATES.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA BEAT GOVERNOR ROMNEY THERE BY FOUR POINTS.\nBUT THIS IS PRETTY SIMPLE. NEVER MIND THE CLINTON/TRUMP\nNUMBERS. DONALD TRUMP IS UNDERPERFORMING\nMITT ROMNEY IN ALL OF THESE STATES IN THIS KEY DEMOGRAPHIC,\nWHAT HAS BEEN A REPUBLICAN DEMOGRAPHIC.\nDONALD TRUMP, IF HE'S GOING TO BEAT HILLARY CLINTON, HE CANNOT\nBE UNDERPERFORMING AND DRAMATICALLY SO THE GUY WHO LOST\nFOUR YEARS AGO. >> JOHN KING, APPRECIATE IT.\nBACK WITH THE PANEL. SCOTTIE, HOW DOES HE IMPROVE ON\nTHOSE NUMBERS? TRUMP'S DOING VERY WELL AMONG\nWHITE NON-COLLEGE GRADUATES, DOING MUCH BETTER THAN SECRETARY\nCLINTON IS, BUT HOW DOES HE GET BETTER AMONG COLLEGE GRADUATES?\n>> I THINK IT GOES BACK TO HIS CORE ISSUES.\nI THINK WHY IS YOU YOU SEE MASSACRE BEING THE ISSUE.\nREUTERS JUST CAME OUT WITH THE POLL TODAY THAT THE LEADING GAP\nFROM HILLARY IS ACTUALLY NARROWING BY FIVE POINTS.\nON TUESDAY, IT WAS 12 POINTS. BY LAST FRIDAY, IT WAS 8 POINTS.\nSO OBVIOUSLY, THIS CONVERSATION, I THINK THIS IS WHY HILLARY\nCLINTON CAME IN YESTERDAY AND CAUSED THIS BIG BROUHAHA WITH\nTHIS TYPE OF A HATE SPEECH THAT SHE GAVE AGAINST\nCONSERVATIVES -- >> BUT YOU'RE SAYING IMMIGRATION\nBEING THE ISSUE THIS WEEK, HAS THAT ACTUALLY HELPED AMONG WHITE\nCOLLEGE GRADUATES? IF ANYTHING, IT HAS BEEN -- IT\nHASN'T BEEN EXACTLY A CLEAR MESSAGE.\nI KNOW TRUMP SUPPORTERS SAY HE'S NOT CHANGING HIS POSITION, BUT\nIT CERTAINLY HAS RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT HIM, IS HE\nSOFTENING, IS HE NOT? HE SAYS HE'S HARDENING.\nDOES THAT ACTUALLY HELP THE CONVERSATION?\n>> WELL, I THINK THE CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW IS WHILE\nTRUMP IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE ACTUAL DETAILS OF THE PLAN,\nIT'S RELEASING WHAT HILLARY CLINTON'S PLAN IS, BLANKET\nAMNESTY TO EVERYONE. AND SHE'S NOT TELLING HOW THE\nMIDDLE CLASS IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO TAKE ON THIS BURDEN\nOF $113 BILLION EVERY YEAR, THE MIDDLE CLASS, FOR ALL OF THE\nILLEGALS THAT ARE IN THIS COUNTRY AND HOW WE ARE GOING TO\nSECURE OUR BORDER. >> MAYOR NUTTER, IS THIS\nSOMETHING TRUMP CAN MAKE INROADS ON?\n>> NO. THE POLLS HOPE IN PENNSYLVANIA\n73 DAYS AND 10 HOURS. SCOTTIE JUST SAID, DONALD TRUMP\nIS STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HIS IMMIGRATION PLAN.\nHE'S BEEN A CANDIDATE FOR 15 MONTHS.\nIT'S HIS SIGNATURE ISSUE. IT'S A SIGNATURE ISSUE FOR THE\nPARTY. HE HAS NO IDEA WHERE HE'S GOING\nWITH THIS OR WITH MANY OTHER ISSUES, WHICH IS WHY HIS\nPOSITIONS CONTINUE TO CHANGE AND THESE VOTERS, LIKE MANY OTHERS,\nDON'T THINK HE'S QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT.\nHE'S NOT READY TO BE PRESIDENT. THE SAME POLL SAID NEARLY 60% OF\nTHEM SAID THAT DONALD TRUMP IS NOT QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT OF\nTHE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. PEOPLE ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO\nTHIS ELECTION. THEY'RE GOING IN ANOTHER\nDIRECTION. >> KAYLEIGH, DO YOU THINK HE CAN\nTURN IT AROUND? >> YES, I DO.\nAND HERE'S WHERE TWO QUICK THINGS, FIRST, YOU MENTIONED\nHE'S DOING VERY WELL AMONG WHITE, NON-COLLEGE GRADUATES.\nTHAT'S AN AREA WHERE WE COULD APPEAL WHERE ROMNEY COULDN'T,\nMcCAIN COULDN'T, BLUE-COLLAR VOTERS IN PENNSYLVANIA AND\nMICHIGAN. THAT'S ONE.\nBUT TWO, AMONG WHITE-INVESTIGATED VOTERS, WHO\nREPUBLICANS HAVE TRADITIONALLY WON, I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO\nLOOK, AND ON ELECTION DAY, THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN THAT\nBALLOT BOX AND THEY'RE GOING TO SAY TO THEMSELVES, WE HAVE A\nSUPREME COURT.

GOOD TO HAVE ALL OF YOU WITH US.\nLET ME BEGIN BY ASKING YOU ABOUT STEPHEN BANNON.\nIT WAS REVEALED IN COURT DOCUMENTS THAT HE MADE\nANTI-SEMETIC REMARKS P SPOKESPERSON FOR BANNON SAYS IT\nIS NOT TRUE. WHAT DOES THIS ALL SAY ABOUT\nWHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.\nTHE KIND OF PROCESSES THAT TAKE PLACE TO VET OUT THAT HE IS\nIRING. >> HE HIRES FIRST AND ASKS\nQUESTIONS SECOND. THIS IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR THE\nCAMPAIGN. THEY MAY SEEM DARK,\nINAPPROPRIATE, AND NASTY, BUT IT GOES TO THE TEMPERAMENT OF THE\nCANDIDATES. AS A MATTER OF FACT, I WOULD\nPOINT OUT THAT IN THE U.S. SENATE RACE IN ILLINOIS MANY\nYEARS AGO, IT WAS THE DIVORCE FILINGS OF THE REPUBLICAN\nCANDIDATE THAT LED TO A CANDIDATE NAMED BARACK OBAMA.\n>> LET ME PIG -- PICK UP ON THAT POINT.\nTHEY HAD NOT VETTED SOMEONE, AND THEY WENT ON WITH THE BRIDGEGATE\nSCANDAL, STEPEN, I BELIEVE, ARE THEY BECOMING A PROBLEM FOR THE\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN? >> ANY KIND OF DISTRACTION LIKE\nTHIS CAN BE ADD. 74 DAYS LEFT, SO ANY DISTRACTION\nCAN BE PROBLEMATIC. I DON'T THINK VOTERS ON THE\nGROUND CARE VERY MUCH WHAT THESE PEOPLE WORKING IN THE CAMPAIGN\nARE DOING. THE REAL QUESTION IS WHERE DOES\nDONALD TRUMP STAND ON THESE KEY ISSUES.\nTHAT IS WHERE THE FOCUS SHOULD BE.\nSO IF STEVE BANNON MADE CONTROVERSIAL REMARKS OR NOT, I\nDON'T THINK VOTERS CARE, BUT THEY CARE ABOUT THE ISSUES HE\nBRINGS TO THE CAMPAIGN. THEY HAVE BEEN ALL OVER THE MAP\nON HIS SIGNATURE ISSUE. >>.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE A HINDRANCE TO THE\nCAMPAIGN. >> PERHAPS THE SENIOR STAFF TOLD\nTRUMP ABOUT HIS BACKGROUND. IF YOU TAKE A QUICK GOOGLE\nSEARCH OF CORY LEWENDOWSKY. AND MR. BANNON.\nTHIS COULD MEAN THAT DONALD TRUMP KNOWS WHO HE IS HIRING AND\nHE IS VERY COMFORTABLE WITH IT. >> ASKING ABOUT IT, IF HE IS\nHIRING A INDIVIDUAL THAT HAD CLOSE RUSSIAN TIES, OR TIES TO\nCLOSE RUSSIAN BUSINESSES, TO THE POINT THAT ROCKET WAS MAKING\nTHERE, DOES HE NOT CARE THAT THESE THINGS IN THE PAST, THESE\nASSOCIATIONS THAT SOME OF HIS SENIOR STAFF MEMBERS HAD ARE\nGOING TO HURT HIS CAMPAIGN. >> IT COULD BE CONSISTENT WITH\nHIS PERSONALITY. THAT THEY DON'T CARE.\nLET THEM ATTACK ME AND THIS WILL FEED THE BEAST.\nBUT IT IS A FAIR ATTACK TO SAY THAT THE PEOPLE YOU SURROUND\nYOURSELF WITH, AND THIS IS WHERE I WILL DISAGREE WITH MY\nCOLLEAGUE, THE PEOPLE YOU SURROUND YOURSELF WITH ARE A\nREFLECTION OF YOUR SENSIBILITIES AND YOUR JUDGMENTS.\nBACK IN THE '08 CAMPAIGN, THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN TURNED OUT THAT\nONE OF THEIR TOP STRATEGISTS WAS LOBBYING FOR COLUMBIA.\n>> JUST VERY QUICKLY, WHAT WE'RE SIEG HERE IN DONALD TRUMP AND\nHILLARY CLINTON IS THE FIRST REAL DECISION, IF YOU WILL, IN\nTERMS OF WHAT THEY WILL MAKE IF THEY BECOME PRESIDENT OF THE\nUNITED STATES. DONALD TRUMP'S FIRST DECISION\nWAS MIKE PENCE. HIS SECOND, OR FIRST, WAS HIRING\nTHE STAFF AROUND HIM. THIS IS INDICATIVE OF HIS\nMANAGEMENT STYLE. .\nSO I DISAGREE WITH THE YOUNG LADY BEFORE BECAUSE I DO THINK\nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE CARE ABOUT THIS KIND OF STUFF.\n>> THIS WAS IN THE WAKE OF DWAYNE WADE'S COUSIN BEING SHOT\nIN CHICAGO. HE IS FACING CRITICISM.\nWALKING HER BABY IN CHICAGO. JUST WHAT I HAVE BEEN SAYING,\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN WILL VOTE TRUMP.\nSEVERAL HOURS LATER AFTER THAT TWEET WAS CRITICIZED ONLINE.\nTHEN TRUMP SAID MY CONDOLENCES TO DWAYNE WADE AND HIS FAMILY.\nTHEY ARE IN MY THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS.\nHERE IS WHAT HE TODAY SAY, TAKE A LISTEN.\nOKAY, I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THAT SOUND BYTE.\nIN SES SENSE, I WANT TO GO TO THE FACT THAT TRUMP WAS SAYING\nSHE ONLY CARED ABOUT AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTES.\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS WILL VOTE FOR TRUMP, NOT EVEN OFFERING HIS\nCONDOLENCES UNTIL SEVERAL HOURS LATER WHEN IT WAS BEING\nCRITICIZED. >> THIS IS THE SAME THING IF YOU\nREMEMBER THAT HE DID AFTER THE ORLANDO SHOOTING.\nHE DID THE SAME EXACT THING. INSTEAD OF OFFERING CONDOLENCES,\nHE JUMPED ON TO THE ISSUE THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN TERRORISM.\nAND HE HAS NOT BEEN COURTING THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE.\nIF HE WAS COURTING THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE, HE WOULD\nSPEAK TO THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN AUDIENCE AND PARTICULARLY\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN LEADERS. THAT IS NOT WHAT HE IS DOING.\nHE IS SPEAKING TO WHITE AUDIENCES TRYING TO COURT A\nWHITE VOTE. HE IS TRYING TO GET THE BASE OF\nTHE REPUBLICAN PARTY BACK THAT HE LOST.\nWHEN HE COMES OUT WITH THESE STATEMENTS, THAT IS HIS GOAL.\nI JUST STEP BACK FOR A MOMENT AS I MADE THE COMMENT BEFORE THAT I\nTHINK IT IS SHOCKING TO IMAGINE THAT TRUMP IS VETTING ALL OF\nTHESE PEOPLE. THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO DID NOT\nEVEN KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE UKRAINE AND RUSSIA.\nTO THINK THAT HE KNEW WHAT PAUL MANAFORT WAS DOING WAS HIGHLY\nSUSPECT. >> ALL RIGHT, JEAN, MICHAEL,\nWE'LL SPEAK TO YOU LATER IN THE HOUR.\nWHEN WE COME BACK, DEAL OR NO DEAL, A HIGHSTAKES CEASE FIRE.\nHOW DOES IT IMPACT US BACK AT",

SO THERE IS SOME CRITICISM THAT\nDONALD TRUMP IS SPENDING SO MUCH TIME THERE.\nDO YOU THINK HE REALLY HAS A CHANCE TO WIN IOWA AND WHAT\nEVIDENCE DO YOU HAVE OF THAT? >> SURE.\nIN IOWA WE DON'T HAVE THE M LARGE MINORITY POPULATIONS THAT\nA LOT OF OTHER STATES DO. HILLARY CLINTON IS REALLY\nTARGETING AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, LATINO COMMUNITIES.\nSO IOWA HAS A LOT OF WHITE MIDDLE CLASS, BLUE COLLAR\nWORKERS THAT REALLY ARE TUNING IN TO DONALD TRUMP'S MESSAGE\nRIGHT NOW. >> ALL RIGHT.\nGIVE US A SENSE OF DONALD TRUMP'S GROUND GAME IN THE STATE\nOF IOWA, HAS HE HAD A BIG PRESENCE THERE?\nDOES HE HAVE FOLKS WHO WORK FOR HIM THAT HAVE BEEN ON THE\nGROUND? >> SURE, HE DOES.\nJUST THIS PAST WEEK THEY ANNOUNCED A NEW ROUND OF FIELD\nDIRECTORS THAT THEY'VE HIRED. A LOT OF THEM ARE PEOPLE WHO\nHAVE BEEN IN THE GAME FOR A LONG TIME.\nTHEY REALLY KNOW THE LAY OF THE LAND.\nDONALD TRUMP IS STARTING TO RAMP UP HIS GROUND GAME NOW GOING\nINTO LABOR DAY.

IT'S BECAUSE -- I WAS A BERNIE\nSANDERS' SUPPORTER AND ONCE IT BECAME CLEAR THAT HE WAS NOT\nGOING TO BE THE NOMINEE, I DECIDED LONG AGO I WASN'T GOING\nTO SUPPORT HILLARY CLINTON.

EMILY, SHE SAYS SHE HAS BEEN\nWAITING FOR THE ALL-CLEAR FROM OFFICIALS IN LOUISIANA.\nSHE DOESN'T WANT TO BE A DISTRACTION YOU.\nSAY WHAT? >> RIGHT.\nSO THE WORD HILLARY CLINTON IS USING IS SHE DOESN'T WANT TO BE\nA DISTRACTION. THAT'S A BAFFLING MOVE ON HER\nPART. SHE SAYS SHE KNOWS BETTER THAN\nTHE LOCALS THAT ARE ASKING HER TO JOIN THEM.\nALSO YOU CAN LOOK AT THE FACT THAT THE SITTING PRESIDENT OF\nTHE UNITED STATES MANAGED TO GO THERE WITHOUT BEING A\nDISTRACTION, SO I THINK IT'S A TOUGH, TOUGH ARGUMENT TO MAKE ON\nHER PART. NOT TO MENTION YOU THINK ABOUT\nTHE ADVOCATE MENTIONED THIS A LONG-TERM RAMIFICATION OF THE\nDISASTER HOME NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS GOING TO\nOVERSEE THE RECOVERY PROCESS.

WHETHER OR NOT YOU AGREE YOU CAN\nAGREE THAT'S REALLY BAD POLITICS AND SO I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT\nPOLITICALLY. OF COURSE MORE IMPORTANTLY THAN\nTHAT, SHE NEEDS TO GET THERE TO OVERSEE THE DAMAGE FROM A\nPRACTICAL STANDPOINT, BUT POLITICALLY A BAFFLING MOVE.\nYOU CAN ADD IN THE FACT THAT 60% OF AMERICAN VOTERS SAY THEY\nDON'T TRUST HER.

SHE IS DOING SURPRISINGLY WELL\nIN GEORGIA, SOUTH CAROLINA, AND AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF SUPPORT IN\nTHE SOUTH. NO REASON FOR HER NOT TO BE\nTHERE. I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANYTHING\nABOUT RESOURCES AND I'M SURE SHE'LL GO.\n>> WOULD SHE BE WELCOMED? YOU HEARD THE GOVERNOR SAY WE'LL\nTAKE ANYBODY TO ADD ATTENTION TO LOUISIANA'S PAIN AND SUFFERING.\n>> ABSOLUTELY. SO THE PEOPLE IN LOUISIANA ARE\nSAYING, ANY ATTENTION THEY CAN GET WILL DRIVE PRIVATE DONATIONS\nTO THE RED CROSS AND OTHER OUTLETS.\nTHEY'RE SORT ON MONEY AND VOLUNTEERS SO SECRETARY CLINTON\nCAN BRING SOME ATTENTION TO THE SITUATION ITCH CAN'T IMAGINE IT\nWOULD BE NEGLECT LESS THAN HELP FOLLOW THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ASKING\nFOR IT THEMSELVES. >> I WONDER IF THERE ISN'T AN\nEXPIRATION DADE.

IT'S A TREFX QUESTION ACTUALLY.\nSURELY I COULD HAVE RETIRED BY NOW.\nI WAS A HEDGE FUND MANAGER. HAD ONE OF THE LARGEST RETURNS\nAFTER 24%. I WILL COME BACK TO THAT NUMBER,\nSO HOLD ONTO IT. BUT I MENTION IT NOW, BECAUSE I\nAM LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO DO WHAT I WANT TO DO AT THIS STAGE\nIN MY LIFE.

SO WHY DO I EVER TALK ABOUT\nINDIVIDUAL STOCKS THEN? SOMEONE MUST WANT THE\nINFORMATION OR WE WOULDN'T HAVE LASTED AS LONG AS WE HAVE.\nIN THE END, THIS IS A COMMERCIAL PRODUCT.\nAND THE MARKET WOULD HAVE DEEMED IT'S WORTH SOMETHING.\nTHIS IS HISTORY. NATIONAL VIDEO, AMERICAN\nAGRONOMICS. ST TECHNOLOGIES, STANDARD PRESS\nSTEEL, GIANT FOODS, HEINZ GA NCH  REMEMBER INDEX FUNDS ARE\nPREFERABLE FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF YOU.\nI KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO BUY INDIVIDUAL STOCKS ANYWAY OR\nYOU WOULDN'T BE WATCHING \"MAD MONEY,\" WHICH BRINGS ME TO SIX\nSTOCKS. NATIONAL VIDEO.\nWHEN I WAS GROWING UP, MY FATHER'S BROTHER KNEW A BROKER,\nAND THAT BROKER'S NAME WAS JACK JACK.\n. MET JACK ONCE.\nMY FATHER WORKED AT GYMABLES, SELLING SLACKS, GABARDINES.\nAND THEN HE SOLD BOXES AND BAGS, GIFT BOXES TO RETAILERS.\nTHOSE WHO HAVE HEARD MY FATHER'S EULOGY DELIVERED THE DAY AFTER\nHE DIED, NOVEMBER OF 2014 KNOW THAT MY DAD HAD A REALLY HARD\nBUSINESS LIFE. HE AND HIS BROTHER STARTED THE\nNATIONAL GIFT WRAP AND BOX COMPANY TO SUPPLY MERCHANTS WITH\nEVERYTHING THEY NEEDED TO BOX, WRAP AND BAG WHATEVER THEY SOLD\nTO THEIR CUSTOMERS. WELL, HE NEVER HAD MUCH\nCOMPETITION. HIS CUSTOMERS WERE ALWAYS GOING\nUNDER AND HE WAS ON THE ROAD QUITE A BIT TRYING TO FIND THE\nNEW ONES. I REMEMBER ENDLESS DAYS OF\nDISCOURAGEMENT. I WAS GROWING UP.\nTHOSE WERE THE DAY WHEN IS MY MOM WOULD TELL ME, GO TO YOUR\nROOM BEFORE POP GOT HOME. HE HAD A HARD DAY.\nIT WAS TOUGHER TO SAVE. HE HAD MONEY IN A BANKING\nACCOUNT AND SAVINGS AND LOAN, BUT IT DIDN'T PAY MUCH INTEREST,\nAND I KNOW HE WAS ALWAYS DEATHLY AFRAID HE COULDN'T PAY THE\nBILLS. SO ONE DAY POP SAID HE KNEW WHAT\nHE WAS GOING TO DO. HE WAS GOING TO BUY THE STOCK OF\nNATIONAL VIDEO, BECAUSE POP'S BROTHER HAD HEARD FROM JACK, THE\nGUY WITH THE GOOD BACKHAND WHO WAS A BROKER, THAT IT WAS THE\nNEXT BIG THING, THE STOCK OF THE MILLENNIUM.\nAT FIRST STOCK WENT UP DRAMATICALLY, AND POP WAS ELATED\nAND HE BOUGHT MORE AND MORE OF IT BECAUSE IT WAS GOING HIGHER.\nIN FACT, THAT WAS REALLY ABOUT ALL POP KNEW ABOUT NATIONAL\nVIDEO. HE EITHER FOUND OUT HOW IT WAS\nDOING BY READING THE FIVE STAR EVENING BULLETIN WHICH CAME OUT\nAT THE CLOSE OF THE MARKET, OR HE'D TURN ON THE RADIO, AND\nTHEY'D LIST A LOT OF CLOSING PRICES ON THE STATION HE PUT ON.\nAND HE'D CHEER, HE'D ENCOURAGE ME TO FOLLOW IT.\nI'VE TOLD YOU IN THE PAST HOW I KEPT A JOURNAL OF STOCKS THAT I\nFOLLOWED IN THE FOURTH GRADE. I DIDN'T KNOW MORE BEYOND WHAT\nPOP KNEW ABOUT NATIONAL VIDEO, BUT I WASN'T PLAYING WITH REAL\nMONEY, HE WAS. SURE ENOUGH, AFTER POP HAD PUT A\nSIZABLE AMOUNT OF HIS LIFE SAVINGS IN, IT STARTED GOING\nDOWN. POP DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, SO\nHE WOULD CHECK IN WITH HIS BROTHER WHO CHECKED IN WITH JACK\nWHO TOLD POP THAT ALL WAS WELL AND HE SHOULD KEEP BUYING\nNATIONAL VIDEO, WHICH HE DID. ALL I CAN SAY IS I'M GLAD FOR\nTWO THINGS. ONE IS THAT POP NEVER BORROWED\nMONEY TO BUY NATIONAL VIDEO, AND TWO, STOCKS BLESSEDLY STOPPED AT\nZERO ON THE WAY DOWN. POP LOST EVERYTHING.\nEVERYTHING. WE DIDN'T TAKE MUCH VACATIONS\nAND WE SURE DIDN'T STAY AT THE RITZ-CARLTON OR FOUR SEASONS\nWHEN WE WENT AWAY. I REMEMBER RITZ MOCK APPLE PIE\nMADE WITH CRACKERS. THERE WAS AN IMPORTANT TAKE AWAY\nTHAT SUFFUSES THE VERY FUNDAMENTAL OF THIS SHOW.\nPEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE TEMPTED TO OWN INDIVIDUAL STOCKS.\nONE OF THE PRECEPTS IS TO KNOW HOW TO INVEST IN INDIVIDUAL\nSTOCK IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO SO. THINK OF THE MISTAKES MY DAD\nMADE WITH NATIONAL VIDEO. FIRST HE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING\nABOUT IT. SO HE HAD NO IDEA HOW THE\nCOMPANY WAS DOING, HOW RISKY IT WAS, HOW IT COULD GO DOWN AS\nWELL AS UP AND HOW IT COULD GO UNDER OF HE RELIED ON A\nSTOCKBROKER FRIEND OF HIS BROTHER.\nHE HAD DONE NO WORK ON IT AT ALL.\nSO HE WAS AT THE MERCY OF THE MOVEMENT OF THE STOCK AND ONLY\nKNEW TO BUY RATHER THAN CUT HIS LOSSES.\nTHAT'S RIGHT, HE HAD A TIP. HE BOUGHT THE TIP UP AND DOWN\nAFTER DOING NO WORK AND HE LOST EVERYTHING.\nSUBSTANTIAL CHUNK OF HIS LIFE SAVINGS.\nSO LET ME GIVE YOU THE BOTTOM LINE OF HERE ARE THE MANY TAKE\nAWAYS. TIPS, AS I LIKE TO SAY, ARE FOR\nWAITERS. TWO, YOU MUST DO HOMEWORK IF\nYOU'RE GOING TO OWN INDIVIDUAL STOCKS.\nTHREE, IF YOU CAN'T DO HOMEWORK, OWN AN INDEX FUND, AND FOUR, IF\nYOU FEAR LOSING MONEY, DON'T OWN STOCKS AT ALL.\nI STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT NATIONAL VIDEO DOES.\nI CAN GOOGLE IT, BUT THAT'S FOR ANOTHER CHAPTER IN TONIGHT'S\nSTORY.

WE DON'T CALL THE SHOW \"MAD\nMONEY\" FOR NOTHING. WE'RE USING \"MAD MONEY\" ONLY TO\nBUY STOCKS.

INITIALLY, WHEN I GOT OUT OF\nSCHOOL I KNOCKED AROUND AS A REPORTER, I MADE ABOUT $153 A\nWEEK. THEN HOMICIDE IN L.A.\nI DIDN'T MAKE MUCH MONEY THERE, BUT I KNEW ENOUGH TO OPEN AN\nIRA. MY DAD TOLD ME TO DO IT.\nSO WHATEVER I HAD AUTOMATICALLY WENT TO THE FIDELITY MAGELLAN\nFUND, BUT I WAS DETERMINED TO TRY TO AUGMENT THAT MUTUAL FUND\nBY BUYING INDIVIDUAL STOCKS. HOWEVER, I WAS GOING TO DO IT\nTHE RIGHT WAY BY RESEARCHING THE STOCKS, GETTING EDS THROUGH THE\nRESEARCH, NOT THROUGH THE BROTHER OR THE BROKER.\nWHERE WAS I GOING TO GET THAT EDGE?\nI FIGURED START READING THE PERIODICALS.\nAND BECAUSE OF A KIND SISTER WHO LET ME CRASH IN HER APARTMENT IN\nTHE VILLAGE, I WAS ABLE TO SAVE SOME MONEY.\nIN FACT, I SAVED MORE THAN $200 BEYOND MY CONTRIBUTIONS TO MY\nIRA AND DECIDED TO USE THAT DEFINITION OF \"MAD MONEY\" TO BUY\nTHE STOCK OF AMERICAN AGRONOMICS.\nWHY? BECAUSE I READ AN ARTICLE THAT\nSAID THAT THIS ORANGE GROWER WAS DOING INCREDIBLY WELL, AND I'D\nBE ON THE GROUND FLOOR IF I BOUGHT IT.\nSO I PICKED UP 10 SHARES OF THIS $9 STOCK.\nI WAS IN ON THE GROUND FLOOR, I WAS IN ON THE CHEAP LINOLEUM\nGROUND FLOOR THAT I ENDED UP SIPPING THAT CUTTY SARK ON.\nI SHOULD HAVE GIVEN UP RIGHT THERE.\nI JUST CHANGED MY M.O. WHAT I DID GIVE UP ON WAS BUYING\nSTOCK ON A WELL-RESEARCHED ARTICLE AND LETTING IT RIDE.\nIT DIDN'T HIT ME ABOUT A BETTER WAY TO DO IT UNTIL I GOT A CALL\nFROM AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE, A HIGH SCHOOL FRIEND, WHICH SAID\nTHAT A LOCAL STEEL MILL, SPS AT THAT HIRING.\nMY FRIEND KNEW I WAS STRUGGLING FOR EXTRA MONEY AND THAT I MIGHT\nWANT ANOTHER JOB. THOSE CALLS IN THE MIDDLE OF A\nRECESSION FOR A JOB, THEY CAN BE LIKE GOLD.\nI SAID NAH, I WAS HAPPY WHERE I WAS, BUT I DECIDED WHY NOT LOOK\nINTO SPS AND SEE HOW IT WAS DOING AS A COMPANY, AS A STOCK.\nSO I WENT TO THE MIDTOWN LIBRARY IN NEW YORK WHERE THEY HAD THE\nPERIODICALS AND READ UP ON EVERYTHING THAT WAS SPS WHICH\nTHEN CHANGED TO SP TECHNOLOGIES. EVERYTHING AT THAT LIBRARY, WALL\nSTREET RESEARCH, YOU NAME IT. AND HERE'S WHAT I DISCOVERED.\nIT FIRST, THERE WASN'T MUCH KNOWN OR WRITTEN ABOUT SPS, AND\nSECOND, WHAT WAS WRITTEN WAS PRETTY DOWN NEGATIVE.\nMY FIRST THOUGHT WAS TO SAY AH WELL, IT'S NOT DOING THAT WELL,\nBUMMER. HOLD IT, MY INFORMATION IS THE\nMOST CURRENT POSSIBLE. I GOT A GUY TELLING ME THEY\nCAN'T HANDLE THE BUSINESS THEY HAVE, AND THEY NEED TO ADD\nADDITIONAL SHIFTS OF UNSKILLED LABOR LIKE ME.\nAND THE PERIODICALS ALL READ NEGATIVE ABOUT IT.\nIN OTHER WORDS, I HAD INSIGHT NOBODY ELSE HAD.\nEVERYBODY PRETTY MUCH KNOWS EVERYTHING AT ONCE.\nINTERPRETATIONS OF NEWS AND EVENTS CAN AUGMENT THOSE EDGES.\nI TOOK EVERYTHING I HAD, EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING I HAD\nSAVED AND I MADE A TON OF MONEY AS THE SPS STORY UNFOLDED.\nENOUGH MONEY THAT I DECIDED TO LOOK AROUND THE OFFICE FOR MORE\nAREAS WHERE I HAD AN EDGE. IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR THAT THE HOT\nFIELD FOR M&A WAS ALL ABOUT OIL AND GAS.\nI THOUGHT, GEEZ, WHY DON'T I FIND ONE THAT HASN'T BEEN\nGOBBLED UP. BACK TO THAT LIBRARY.\nI FOUND A COMPANY CALLED NATOMMIS.\nWE WERE TALKING ABOUT $300 AND BOUGHT THAT STOCK.\nI DON'T THINK I HAD TO WAIT VERY LONG BEFORE I CAUGHT ANOTHER\nTAKEOVER BID. AT THAT POINT I WAS HOOKED.\nIT CHANGED EVERYTHING FOR ME, CHANGED MY WHOLE CAREER PLAN.\nI PUT MONEY IN MY MUTUAL FUND, BUT ANYTHING LEFT WENT INTO\nINDIVIDUAL STOCK. I KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT\nTHERE WHO WILL SAY NONE OF THIS IS POSSIBLE TODAY, FIRST, THE\nRESEARCH THAT IS SO SCANTY BACK THEN IS AVAILABLE ON THE WEB.\nWOULD YOU HAVE KNOWN THAT SPS WAS HIRING, DOING WELL.\nTHIRD, THERE ARE NOW RULES THAT MAKE IT SO IT'S HARD TO GET ANY\nKIND OF EDGE BECAUSE COMPANIES HAVE TO GIVE FULL DISCLOSURE.\nSOME WOULD SAY YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY GAIN STOCKS AT ALL, AND\nYOU MIGHT AS WELL BUY AN INDEX FUND, YOU KNOW I'M NOT AGAINST\nTHAT. I WAS INVESTING IN INDIVIDUAL\nSTOCKS RIGHT ALONGSIDE A MUCH  YOU CAN PICK STOCKS THAT MIGHT\nBE DOING MUCH BETTER THAN THE AVERAGE STOCK AND CAN AUGMENT\nYOUR SAVINGS. HAVE SOME EDGE AND STAY CURRENT\nON THE COMPANY. HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE.\nREMEMBER AMERICAN AGRONOMICS AND SPS, IF YOU ONLY KNOW WHAT ONE\nPERSON SAYS IN THE MEDIA, ME OR THE WRITER OF FORBES.\nI'M TELLING YOU, THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH.\nIT'S A START, BETTER TO HAVE GENUINE INSIGHT OTHERS MIGHT NOT\nHAVE, ESPECIALLY IF IT'S AGAINST THE GRAIN OF THE CONSENSUS, IT\nIS IN THE END ABOUT THE ODDS, AND ANY HARD WORK YOU CAN DO TO\nINCREASE YOUR ODDS WILL MAKE IT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT YOU\nWILL SUCCEED AS AN INDIVIDUAL INVESTOR, WHICH IN THE END\nSHOULD BE THE REASON YOU WATCH THIS SHOW.\nJOE IN NEW YORK. JOE.\n>> Caller: THIS IS JOE FROM KINGS PARK, NEW YORK.\nTHANK YOU FOR TAKING MYLE CALL. >> OF COURSE.\n>> Caller: THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR WISDOM WITH YOUR VIEWERS.\n>> I GOT A GREAT STAFF THAT HELPS ME.\nTHANK YOU. >> Caller: IF I WANT TO\nDIVERSIFY AND ADD THREE OR FOUR COMPANIES TO MY PORTFOLIO FOR\nTHE LONG TERM BUT BY DIVERSIFYING I WOULD ONLY BUY\nTWO OR THREE SHARES OF EACH COMPANY OR WOULD IT BE BETTER TO\nBUY TEN SHARES OF ONE OF THEM, WHAT IS THE LEAST AMOUNT YOU\nWOULD INVEST? >> I'VE DONE TEN SHARES, I'VE\nDONE TWO OR THREE TIMES AT VARIOUS TIMES.\nBUT I DO FAVOR INDEX FUND FOR YOUR FIRST INVESTMENTS AND ONLY\nAFTER YOU'VE MAXED OUT ON INDEX FUNDS WOULD I SUGGEST YOU BUY\nINDIVIDUAL STOCK. NOBODY SAID INVESTING WAS EASY.\nIT REQUIRES GENUINE INSIGHT, TIME AND HARD WORK ON YOUR PART,\nBUT DON'T WORRY, WE'LL DO IT TOGETHER.\nSO STAY WITH CRAMER!",

THE MAN IS A NATIONAL DISGRACE.\nTODAY \"THE WASHINGTON POST\" HAD A SCATHING EDITORIAL ABOUT THIS\nMAN WHO HAS CONTINUALLY FLOUTED THE LAW.\nHAS BEEN FOUND IN CONTEMPT OF COURT REPEATEDLY.\nAND HAS NOW BEEN REFERRED FOR CRIMINAL PROSECUTION TO THE\nDEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE BECAUSE HE REFUSES TO STOP RACIAL PROFILING\nTO KEEP HIS DEPUTIES FROM HARASSING LATINOS, WHO ARE U.S.\nCITIZENS, BY THE WAY. SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF\nTHEIR SKIN AND HOW THEY LOOK AND SOUND.\nAND THIS IS A MAN WHO IS ADVISING A POTENTIAL PRESIDENT\nON IMMIGRATION LAW. I'M SORRY, BUT IT JUST DOES NOT\nRING TRUE OR CREDIBLE OR ANYTHING IN TERMS OF THIS MAN\nHAVING ANYTHING TO DO WITH OUR NATION'S IMMIGRATION LAWS.\n>> HE TALKED ABOUT THE NIXON ADMINISTRATION AND HOPING TO\nPUNISH MEXICO IN WAYS OTHER THAN SPECIFICALLY DEALING WITH THE\nIMMIGRATION ISSUE. DO YOU THINK DONALD TRUMP HAS\nSAID THEY'RE GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL.\nTHAT THERE IS ANY REALISTIC ELEMENT THERE THAT WE'LL SEE IN\nTHIS PLAN THAT COMES OUT AND WHAT I EXPECT -- OR THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN SAYS WILL BE FOR TWO WEEKS?\n>> NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT. EVERY TIME SOMEBODY LIKE SHERIFF\nARPAIO OR DONALD TRUMP TALKS ABOUT PUNISHING MEXICO OR MAKING\nMEXICO PAY FOR THE BIG BEAUTIFUL WALL, YOU HEAR LAUGHTER COMING\nOUT OF THE EQUIVALENT OF THE WHITE HOUSE IN MEXICO.\nBECAUSE THESE ARE NOT PEOPLE WHO ARE PUTTING FORWARD RATIONAL\nTHOUGHTFUL REALISTIC PROPOSALS TO DEAL WITH WHAT IS A\nSIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IN OUR COUNTRY.\nTHAT'S WHY YOU HAVE THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS WHO SUPPORT\nCOMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM WHO UNDERSTAND THAT OUR\nNATIONAL'S IMMIGRATION LAWS ARE BROKEN BUT THAT WE HAVE TO\nAPPROACH IT IN A WAY THAT IS ACADEMIC, THAT IS FACTUAL, AND\nTHAT REALLY FOCUSES ON SOLVING THE PROBLEM.\nAND WE HAVE HAD A SOLUTION IN FRONT OF US FOR YEARS.\nIT'S SOMETHING THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS PUSHED FRANKED.\nIT'S SOMETHING THAT PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSHED.\nTHIS IS SOMETHING THAT HILLARY CLINTON SUPPORTS AND IF WE HAD\nHAD A SENSIBLE REPUBLICAN CONGRESS THAT WOULD UNDERSTAND\nTHAT THIS IS THE SOLUTION WE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN IMMIGRATION\nREFORM TODAY. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING\nTIM KAINE SAID YESTERDAY ABOUT DONALD TRUMP THAT'S GETTING A\nLOT OF ATTENTION. DO WE HAVE IT?\nWE CAN PLAY IT AND WE CAN TALK ON THE OTHER SIDE.\nWE DON'T HAVE THE SOUND. LET ME READ FOR YOU WHAT HE\nSAID. HE WAS TALKING ABOUT DONALD\nTRUMP. THIS IS WHAT HE SAID.\nYESTERDAY HILLARY CLINTON GAVE A SPEECH IN RENO, NEVADA, CALLING\nOUT DONALD TRUMP ON A LOT OF THINGS ON THIS EQUITY IDEA.\nOR EQUALITY IDEA CALLING HIM OUT ON THE FACT HE HAS SUPPORTERS\nLIKE DAVID DUKE CONNECT WOULD THE KU KLUX KLAN GOING AROUND\nSAYING DONALD TRUMP IS THEIR CANDIDATE BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP\nIS PUSHING THEIR VALUES, KU KLUX KLAN VALUES, DONALD TRUMP VALUES\nARE NOT AMERICAN VALUES. DID TIM KAINE GO TOO FAR THERE\nIN INVOKING THE KKK, INVOKING DAVID DUKE?\nWHEN DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF HAS SAID HE DOES NOT WANT THE VOTES\nOF WHITE SUPREMACISTS? >> ABSOLUTELY NOT.\nTHIS IS SOMETHING THAT DONALD TRUMP AND HIS CAMPAIGN HAVE\nBROUGHT ON THEMSELVES. WHEN IT TAKES YOU THREE TRIES TO\nDENOUNCE DAVID DUKE AFTER YOU HAVE LIED AND SAID YOU DON'T\nEVEN KNOW WHO DAVID DUKE IS. YOU BRING IT UPON YOURSELF FOR\nPEOPLE TO BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE GIVING A WINK AND NOD TO THE\nWHITE SUPREMACIST MOVEMENT. THAT'S NOT ALL.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS REPEATEDLY RETWEETED SEVERAL INFLUENCERS\nTHAT ARE IN THE CIRCLE OF THE WHITE SUPREMACIST AND WHITE\nNATIONALIST MOVEMENT ON SOCIAL MEDIA.\nHIS FIELD DIRECTORS ARE FOLLOWERS OF WHITE SUPREMACISTS\nONLINE. IN HIS VERY FIRST GENERAL\nELECTION AD, HE NOT ONLY DEMONIZES IMMIGRANTS BUT USES\nSTATISTICS AND FIGURES FROM THE CENTER FOR IMMIGRATION STUDIES,\nWHICH IS RUN BY A GENTLEMAN BY THE NAME OF JOHN TAUNTEN WHO IS\nKNOWN TO HAVE TIES TO THE WHITE SUPREMACIST MOVEMENT.\nTHERE IS NOTHING THAT TIM KAINE SAID THAT WAS NOT TRUE.\nAND IT WAS GREAT THAT HILLARY CLINTON MADE THE SPEECH\nCONNECTING DONALD TRUMP TO THESE RACIALLY DIVISIVE MOVEMENTS.\nBECAUSE IT IS SOMETHING THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE TO\nUNDERSTAND. AND BY THE WAY THEY ALREADY\nBELIEVE IT. 2/3 OF AMERICANS REPEATEDLY IN\nPOLL AFTER POLL BELIEVE THAT DONALD TRUMP IS RACIALLY -- IS\nRACIST AND IS RACIALLY BIGOTED. >> WE SAW THOSE STATS COME OUT\nTHE QUINNIPIAC POLL. THE WAY THAT DONALD TRUMP SPEAKS\nAPPEALS TO BIGOTRY. WE'LL SEE HOW THIS CONTINUES\nOVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS, MARIA CARDONA, THANKS SO MUCH.\n>> THANK YOU, GREAT TO BE WITH YOU.\n>> LIKE WISE.

IN 1980, JIMMY CARTER, THEY SAID\nHE WAS TIED TO THE KU KLUX KLAN. IS IT RACIST, IS IT TERRIBLE?\nYES, BUT AT THIS POINT, IT'S BEEN TRIED SO MANY TIMES.\nIT'S JUST CYNICAL. LAUGHABLY CYNICAL.\nAND THEY OUGHT TO BE EMBARRASSED.\n>> LET ME COME BACK TO YOU, DANIELLE.\nYOU SAID THEY NEED TO GET BACK TO THE ISSUE.\nTHIS IS A PROVERBIAL WHERE WE'RE NOW, NO, YOU'RE A BIGOT, NO,\nYOU'RE A BIGOT. YOU PUSH THE KKK.\nAT SOME POINT, DO WE GET BACK TO -- I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THE\nIMMIGRATION CONVERSATION OR THE GUN CONTROL CONVERSATION.\nBUT THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE ARE FOLLOWING AND WE'RE DISCUSSING.\nCAN WE MAKE THAT PIVOT BACK TO THE ISSUES, THE POLICIES?\n>> WE HAVE TO. HE HAS CAMPAIGNED ON DIVISION\nAND NAME CALLING AND THE IMMIGRATION PLAN AND SO MANY\nDAYS AFTER THE ELECTION, THIS SHOULD BE ABOUT THE ISSUES, IT'S\nWHAT PEOPLE ON MAIN STREET WANT TO HEAR ABOUT.\nTHEY DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT NAME CALLING.\nI THINK CLINTON IS RIGHT TO PUNCH BACK IS OBVIOUS.\nHE'S BEEN FROM THE VERY GET-GO, NOT ONLY GET THE PRIMARY\nOPPONENTS BUT CERTAINLY AGAINST HER.\nWE SHOULD HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT IMMIGRATION.\nI WOULD LOVE TO KNOW WHAT DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO DO ABOUT\nIMMIGRATION WHICH IS TO BUILD A WALL.\nWHICH, BY THE WAY, 60% OF AMERICANS DON'T WANT THAT TO\nHAPPEN. >> WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT\nTHAT LATER IN THE SHOW. BUT JEFFREY, IT'S DIFFICULT FOR\nSOME VOTERS TO GET TO THE POLICY PROPOSALS FROM DONALD TRUMP\nBECAUSE THEY HEAR RHETORIC WHICH IS DISTURBING.\nTHEY BROUGHT IT UP. AND I'M GOING TO BRING IT UP\nWITH YOU. THE QUINNIPIAC POLL JUST OUT ON\nTHURSDAY, 59%, TO BE PRECISE, OF THE VOTERS POLLED SAID THAT,\nQUOTE, BELIEVE THAT THE WAY DONALD TRUMP TALKS APPEALS TO\nBIGOTRY. DOES HE HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB\nOF ARTICULATING THESE POSITIONS? AND DOES HE NEED TO COME OUT AND\nBE A LITTLE FORCEFUL OF NOT WANTING THE VOTES OF WHITE\nSUPREMACISTS? >> FIRST OF ALL, HE DOES WANT\nTHE VOTE OF THE WHITE SUPREMACISTS.\nI THINK WE NEED TO HAVE THE DISCUSSION WHAT IS BIGOTRY, WHEN\nYOU TAKE AFRICAN-AMERICANS FOR GRANTED AS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY\nHAS DONE. VICTOR, THE KU KLUX KLAN, I\nDON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS IN 1924, THEY COULDN'T EVEN PASS A\nRESOLUTION AT THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION CONDEMNING\nTHAT. >> FRANKLY, WE DO THIS ALL THE\nTIME -- >> HOLD ON.\nHOLD ON. JEFFR\nJEFFREY, FINISH. >> THE NEW DEAL WAS BUILT ON\nRACISM. FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT BOASTED TO\nJACKSON WHO WAS A KLAN MEMBER THAT A LOT OF HIS FRIENDS WERE\nKLAN MEMBERS. RACE PLUS PROGRESSIVISM EQUALS\nPOLITICAL POWER. IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A\nDISCUSSION ABOUT BIGOTRY, WE OUGHT TO HAVE A DISCUSSION HOW\nIT'S USED IN THE MODERN DAY DEMOCRATIC PARTY WITH AL\nSHARPTON AND ALL OF THAT KIND OF THING.\n>> DANIELLE, I'LL LET YOU FINISH IT UP.\n>> JEFFREY, YOU DO THIS OVER AND OVER, YOU PAINT THE DEMOCRATIC\nPARTY, AND IT'S SIMPLY NOT TRUE. HILLARY CLINTON IS RUNNING,\nSHE'S TALKED VERY FORCEFULLY ABOUT ISSUES THAT WE STILL HAVE\nIN THIS COUNTRY, ABOUT THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE RACISM.\nTHERE ARE SO MANY WAYS THIS MANIFESTS ITSELF DAY TO DAY.\nEVERYONE, AFRICAN-AMERICANS, EVERYBODY WANTS EQUAL\nOPPORTUNITIES WANTS EDUCATION. SHE'S PLANNED OTHER THAN RANDOM\nIDEAS OF HOW TO DO THAT. >> HOPEFULLY, WE'LL GET TO SOME\nOF THOSE PLAN. THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WASN'T\nPART OF AN INTERVIEW. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT TIM KAINE\nINTRODUCED AS PUSHING THEIR VALUES.\nTHE KU KLUX KLAN VALUES. THE DAVID DUKE VALUES, AS YOU\nSAY, DANIELLE, YOU SUSPECT THIS WILL CONTINUE.\nTHANK YOU BOTH. >> THANK YOU, VICTOR.\n>> THANK YOU.",

HE'S NOT AN AMERICAN.\nHE'S ONE OF THEM IN THE CONTEXT OF THE WAR ON TERROR.\nHE'S NOT ONE OF US.

YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP, WHO IS\nDOUBLING DOWN ON HIS ATTACKS AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON.\nHE'S CONTINUING TO CALL HER A BIGOT.\nCLINTON SAYS THAT HIS CAMPAIGN IS BUILT ON PREJUDICE AND\nPARANOIA. THOSE ARE THE TWO WORDS SHE\nREALLY WANTS TO STICK FOR PEOPLE.\nYOU HAVE TIM KAINE REALLY IN ONE OF THE HARSHEST CRITICISMS YET\nOF DONALD TRUMP ON THIS. HE SAYS HE'S TALKING ABOUT KKK\nVALUES AND THE NEXT BREATH, HE SAYS DONALD TRUMP VALUES.\nTHIS IS JUST, IT'S GETTING VERY NASTY.\n>> IT IS. TIM KAINE TAKING THAT EXTRA LEAP\nALMOST GOING ONE STEP FURTHER THAN HILLARY CLINTON DID\nYESTERDAY. IT SHOWS HOW MUCH THIS HAS\nDEVOLVED. THESE ARE BIG, WEIGHTY WORDS\nTHAT THE CANDIDATES, ON BOTH SIDES, ARE THROWING OUT THAT\nHAVE SOME REAL MEANING HERE. I ALSO THINK THIS ALSO\nHIGHLIGHTS HOW BOTH CANDIDATES REALLY THINK THE BEST STRATEGY\nIS TAKING THE ON THE OTHER. NOT NECESSARILY TALKING THEIR\nPOLICIES UP. IT SHOWS IT COULD BE LASTING\nSPAT. >> YOU SEE THIS VULNERABILITY\nFOR TRUMP. THAT'S BECAUSE WHEN HE'S ASKED\nABOUT DAVID DUKE, SUPPORTING HIM AND HE SAYS HE DOESN'T KNOW.\nHE EITHER HAS A TERRIBLY SHORT MEMORY OR HE'S NOT BEING HONEST\nABOUT IT BECAUSE FOR YEARS, I THINK HE SAID HE WASN'T GOING TO\nTAKE THE REFORM PARTY NOMINATION BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT DAVID\nDUKE SUPPORT. HE KNEW YEARS AGO WHO THIS GUY\nWAS AND IT TOOK HIM FOREVER TO DISAVOW.\nHE'S LEAVING THIS GIANT VULNERABILITY ON THIS.\n>> LEAVING A HUGE OPENING FOR TIM KAINE TO COME OUT AND SAY\nSOMETHING LIKE THAT WHICH IS IN SOME WAYS, OVER THE TOP.\nI THINK WE ALL THOUGHT THIS CAMPAIGN WOULD GO INTO THE\nGUTTER. I DON'T THINK WE THOUGHT IT WAS\nGOING TO GO INTO THE GUTTER IN AUGUST.\nI THINK MAYBE THE SECOND WEEK OF SEPTEMBER WHEN THE KIDS GO BACK\nTO SCHOOL. THINGS REALLY HAVE GONE\nDOWNHILL. IF WE'RE AT THIS POINT IN THE\nCAMPAIGN RIGHT NOW WHERE THEY ARE BOTH CALLING EACH OTHER\nRACISTS AND BIGOTS, WHERE ARE WE GOING TO BE BY MID-SEPTEMBER AND\nTHE FIRST OF OCTOBER. WHAT DOES IT SAY TO THE REAL\nSTAGE THAT WE HAVE OUR TWO PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES GOING\nAFTER EACH OTHER THIS WAY. >> WHERE DO YOU THINK WE GO FROM\nHERE? >> WHAT'S INTERESTING, TO YOU\nPOINT, IS HOW MUCH MATERIAL THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS TO DRAW\nFROM TO PRODUCE THESE ADS, TO SORT OF LIKE THIS MAKE THIS CASE\nAGAINST TRUMP WHICH SPEAKS TO THE FACT THAT OVER THE LAST\nSEVERAL MONTHS, TRUMP HAS NOT DONE A GREAT JOB OF CUTTING THIS\nOFF. I ALSO THINK THERE'S A RISK FOR\nTHE CAMPAIGN. THERE'S A LOT OF AMERICANS WHO\nDON'T WANT TO BE CALLED RACIST. THEY DON'T WANT TO BE TOLD THAT\nBECAUSE THEY SUPPORT A POLITICAL CANDIDATE THAT MEANS THEY ARE\nBIGOTED BY ASSOCIATION WITH DONALD TRUMP.\nTHERE'S A FINE LINE HERE. I'M NOT SURE THAT WE'VE TOTALLY\nCROSSED IT BUT WE'RE GETTING CLOSE.\n>> RON, CHECK THIS OUT. CHECK OUT WHAT SEAN SPICER JUST\nTWEETED. HE FEELS THAT TIM KAINE WENT\nOVERBOARD HERE. HE SAID KKK COMMENTS ARE PREP\nREHENABLE AND OVER THE TOP. DEMOCRATS WHO DON'T DENOUNCE ARE\nCOMPLICIT. THEY ARE TRYING TO PUT THE BALL\nIN THE COURT OF DEMOCRATS. HOW DOES THIS PLAY OUT?\n>> I HAVEN'T SEEN THE WHOLE TIM KAINE STATEMENT.\nLINKING HIM TO THE KKK IN THAT WAY IS OVER THE TOP.\nAS ABBY SAID, DONALD TRUMP HAS GIVEN THEM A LOT OF AMMUNITION\nHERE. IF YOU SAY, TO ME THE TWO NORTH\nSTARS IN THIS RACE ARE THE CONSISTENTLY IN POLLING.\n60% OF THE COUNTRY SAYS THEY DON'T CONSIDER HIM QUALIFIED AND\n60% IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER SAY THEY CONSIDER HIS RACIALLY\nBIASSED OR BIGOTED. 58% SAID HE USES LANGUAGE THAT\nAPPEALS TO BIGOTS. THAT NUMBER RISES TO OVER 70%\nAMONG BOTH MILLENIALS. HE'S CREATE ADD SIGNIFICANT\nPROBLEM FOR HIMSELF. HE WAS NOT TEFLON IN THE\nPRIMARIES. EVERYONE IN THE COUNTRY WAS\nLISTENING TO THE ARGUMENTS HE MADE TO MOBILIZE THE MOST\nALIENATED PARTS. DEMOCRATS PROBABLY DON'T NEED TO\nGO OVER BOARD IN RETURNING TO THAT.\nI THINK DONALD TRUMP HAS ENGRAVED THAT IMAGE.\n>> I THINK WE HAVE THE SOUND OF TIM KAINE AND WHAT HE SAID.\nI'M GOING TO SORT OF LET THEM CUE THAT UP IN THE CONTROL ROOM.\nHE DID SORT OF REALLY SAY IN ONE BREATH, KU KLUX KLAN VALUES,\nDAVID DUKE VALUES, DONALD TRUMP VALUES.\n>> YESTERDAY HILLARY CLINTON GAVE A SPEECH CALLING OUT DONALD\nTRUMP ON THIS EQUALITY IDEA. CALLING HIM OUT ON THE FACT HE\nHAS SUPPORTERS LIKE DAVID DUKE CONNECTED WITH THE KU KLUX KLAN\nWHO IS SAYING DONALD TRUMP IS THEIR CANDIDATE BECAUSE HE'S\nPUSHING THEIR VALUES. KU KLUX KLAN VALUES, DAVID DUKE\nVALUES ARE NOT DONALD TRUMP VALUES.\n>> PRETTY CLEAR WHERE HE WAS GOING WITH THAT.\nJUST A COMMA IN BETWEEN EACH ONE OF THOSE.\nDONALD TRUMP WENT, AND WE SAID THIS AT THIS TABLE EARLIER THIS\nWEEK WENT WAY OVER THE LINE WHEN HE CALLED HILLARY CLINTON A\nBIGOT. IT WAS A RIDICULOUS STATEMENT\nTHAT DONALD TRUMP MADE EARLIER THIS WEEK ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHIS MANY WAYS, I THINK WE'VE SEEN THE SAME THING WITH TIM\nKAINE. AS HIS JOB AS THE VICE\nPRESIDENT, HE'S THE ONE THAT'S SUPPOSED TO GO OUT AND DO THAT.\nTHAT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO COME FROM THE LIPS OF HILLARY CLINTON.\nI DO THINK THAT WE'RE DEVOLVING INTO THIS POLITICS THAT'S REALLY\nGONE SO FAR INTO THE GUTTER THAT IT'S GOT DIRTY.\n>> REPUBLICANS, I'M WAITING TO SEE BECAUSE THESE TIM KAINE\nCOMMENTS ARE A LITTLE NEWER. YOU HAVE THE TWEET FROM SEAN\nSPICER AT THE RNC BUT WHAT ABOUT REPUBLICANS BY IN LARGE.\nYOU DON'T HEAR A LOUD CHORUS OF PEOPLE BACKING DONALD TRUMP UP\nON THIS. >> THIS IS THE KIND OF THING\nTHEY WANT TO STAY OUT OF.

WHO IS NOW RUNNING THIS MESSAGE.\nIS THIS DONALD TRUMP LEADING A MESSAGE WHERE HE WANTS TO GO IN\nAND ATTEMPT TO TIE HER TO RACISM IS THAT FASHION IN HIS CAMPAIGN\nLEADING HIM AROUND? >> THERE ARE INTENSE DISCUSSIONS\nAROUND DONALD TRUMP ABOUT HOW TO PROCEED WITH HIS CANDIDACY, WITH\nHIS MESSAGE. IT'S NOT BEING DOMINATED BY A\nPARTICULAR PERSON, BUT THERE'S AN ORBIT AROUND HIM, RUDY\nGUILIANI. AND IT'S ABOUT WHO'S WITH HIM AT\nTRUMP TOWER, WHO IS ON THE PHONE AND PLANE WITH HIM.\nTHESE PEOPLE ARE TELLING HIM TO MODERATE AND SOFTEN HIS PITCH.\nAND OTHERS ARE MORE REFLECTIVE OF THAT POPULACE NATIONAL CORE\nOF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. THIS IS SOMETHING HE'S\nNAVIGATING LIKE HE'S IN THE POLITICAL DARK TRYING TO FIGURE\nOUT HOW TO WIN WITHOUT LOSING WHO HE IS WITH HIS CAMPAIGN.\n>> JONATHAN, ACTUALLY, THAT'S ALARMING.\nIT SOUNDS LIKE HE'S BEEN BLOWN BY THE WINDS WHICHEVER DIRECTION\nTHEY'RE BLOWING STRONGEST INSIDE OF HIS INNER CIRCLE.\nIS THERE A COHERENT CORE OR IS THERE A CAMPAIGN BEING LED BY\nTHE LOUDEST VOICE IN THE MOMENT. >> THAT GETS TO THE KEY THING,\nYOU USE THE RIGHT WORD, CORE, YOU DON'T GET BLOWN AROUND, YOU\nDON'T GET SWAYED IF YOU HAVE A SOLID CORE, IF YOU HAVE A\nFOUNDATION THAT YOU BELIEVE IN. HIS SIGNATURE ISSUE HAS BEEN\nIMMIGRATION, BUILD THE WALL, DEPORT 11 MILLION PEOPLE.\nTODAY COULD SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME EXACTLY WHAT HIS\nIMMIGRATION PLAN IS BECAUSE IT'S HARDENED.\nIT'S SOFTENED. IT'S GONE AWAY, COME BACK, ALL\nWITHIN THE SPACE OF FOUR DAYS.

HE IS NOW STRONG AND HAS GOT A\nSTRONG AND POWERFUL WALL. DO YOU NOW UNDERSTAND THE\nPOWERFUL AND STRONG STRATEGY OF THE MAN WHO IS NO LONGER\nSOFTENING? >> I DON'T THINK ANYBODY DOES.\nTHERE IS NO STRATEGY HERE. FRANKLY, WHAT HE'S DOING IS\nSIMPLY GIVING SIGNALS TO HIS BASE THAT HE'S STRONG WHENEVER\nTHERE'S ANY KIND OF PERCEPTION OF WEAKNESS.\nBECAUSE THIS WHOLE CAMPAIGN IS BUILT ON THE TOXIC MASCULINE\nIDEAL OF STRENGTH. SO ANY TIME YOU USE ANY KIND OF\nPERCEIVED WEAKNESS, HE HAS TO SHOW SOME STRENGTH.\nTHERE'S NOTHING ABOUT POLICY HERE.\nIT'S JUST ABOUT PERCEPTION. >> I HAVE TO TURN TO YOU ON\nTHIS. YOU ARE OUR STRATEGIST AT THE\nTABLE. WHEN YOU ARE ADVISING A\nCANDIDATE AND THEY ARE BUILDING A BRAND ESSENTIALLY WHICH IS\nWHAT POLITICS IS, YOU DID HAVE THIS SORT OF TUG-OF-WAR THAT'S\nAPPARENT INSIDE OF TRUMP WORLD. YOU HAVE THE KELLYANNE CONWAY\nFACTION SAYING HE NEEDS TO BE SOFTER, NEEDS TO APPEAL TO\nWOMEN. SO HE DID THE SOFTENING.\nHE SAID THE WORDS IT'S A SOFTENING.\nNOW HE SEEMS TO HAVE RECOILED FROM ALL OF THE I GUESS THE REST\nOF US SORT OF GIGGLING AND SAYING THE SOFTENING OVER AND\nOVER AND OVER AGAIN AND HE NOW HEARS WHAT SOUNDS LIKE WEAKNESS\nAND SORT OF THE ALT-RIGHT PART OF HIS WORLD IS PULLING HIM BACK\nTOWARD TRYING TO BE STRONG AND MACHO, SAYING IT'S A POWERFUL\nWALL. IS THERE A WAY TO DO BOTH THINGS\nIN ONE STRATEGY? >> KELLYANNE CONWAY HAS TO BE\nHITTING HER HEAD AGAINST THE WALL AT THIS POINT THAT SHE'S\nGOT HIM OUT THERE SAYING THAT HE IS GOING TO TAKE -- BE A SOFTER\nGENTLER DONALD TRUMP ONE DAY AND SEVERAL HOURS LATER, HE HAS\nCHANGED HIS MIND BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING DONALD TRUMP LIKES LESS\nTHAN BEING CRITICIZED. SO THE MINUTE HE WAS CRITICIZED,\nYOU SAW HIM AS YOU MENTIONED RECOIL.\nBUT I WOULD JUST SAY WE SHOULD ALL TAKE A STEP BACK AND LOOK AT\nWHAT HE'S DONE. THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO CLAIMED NOT\nTO BE A POLITICIAN, TO BE AN OUTSIDER.\nHE SPENT THE LAST YEAR THREATENING 12 MILLION PEOPLE\nTHAT HE WAS GOING TO RIP THEM FROM THEIR FAMILIES AND SEND\nTHEM AWAY, PUT THEM IN JAIL. THEY WERE GOING TO BE GONE.\nNOW ALL OF A SUDDEN, FOR POLITICAL REASONS ONLY, BECAUSE\nTHERE'S NO OTHER REASON HE WOULD DO THIS, HE HAS NOW CHANGED HIS\nMIND TWICE IN THE LAST 48 HOURS. THAT IS POLITICS THROUGH AND\nTHROUGH. IT IS A DISASTER FOR A\nSTRATEGIST AND FOR KELLYANNE CONWAY AND THIS CAMPAIGN.\n>> IT IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE WHEN WE WERE WAITING FOR A SPEECH IT\nWAS SUPPOSED TO TAKE PLACE ON THURSDAY WHERE HE WOULD LAY OUT\nHIS STRATEGY OSTENSIBLY. NOW THAT'S BEEN DELAYED.\nTHEY SAY IT'S COMING IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS.\nDO YOU DETECT WITHIN THE CAMPAIGN, IS THERE AN INTERNAL\nDEBATE OVER WHETHER HE SHOULD DO THE SOFTENING OR NOT DO THE\nSOFTENING OR IS DONALD TRUMP JUST NOT CLEAR ON WHAT HE WANTS\nTO DO? >> I THINK DONALD TRUMP IS NOT\nCLEAR ON WHAT HE WANTS TO DO. I ACTUALLY WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED\nIF THEY KEPT THIS KIND OF AMBIGUOUS SO YOU HAVE KIND OF\nTHE TWO PILLARS OF HIS PLAN. YOU HAVE THE WALL PERTAINING TO\nBORDER SECURITY. HE'S BEEN ADAMANT ABOUT THAT,\nKEEPING UP THAT CHANT. BUT ON THE ISSUE OF DEPORTATION,\nHE HAS BEEN I THINK INTENTIONALLY AMBIGUOUS OR AT\nLEAST THAT'S THE ADVICE COMING FROM HIS CAMPAIGN, BECAUSE YOU\nHAVE OF COURSE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY VOTERS WHO SUPPORTED HIM\nIN THE PRIMARY. PEW RESEARCH FOUND ONLY 60% OF\nTHOSE ADAMANT TRUMP SUPPORTERS ASSOCIATE IMMIGRANTS WITH\nCRIMINALITY. AND SO THAT'S KIND OF WHERE HE'S\nGOING WITH THE CRIME ISSUE. THEN OF COURSE, YOU HAVE A\nMAJORITY OF REPUBLICANS WHO DIDN'T SUPPORT TRUMP IN THE\nPRIMARY SO PEOPLE WHO SUPPORTED CRUZ AND KASICH WAS THE LAST\nTIME THIS WAS MEASURED. THEY DID NOT SUPPORT THE\nDEPORTATION EFFORTS. >> HE'S TRYING TO WALK THAT\nBACK. >> THOSE ARE SUCH HARD THINGS TO\nRECONCILE FOR THIS CANDIDATE IN PARTICULAR.\n>> THE ROUNDTABLE IS STICKING WITH US.\nUP NEXT, THESE THREE WILL TELL ME SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW.                \u00e2\u0099\u00aa\u00e2\u0099\u00aa",

CORE.\nYOU DON'T GET BLOWN AROUND, YOU DON'T GET SWAYED FROM ONE MINUTE\nTO THE OTHER IF YOU HAVE A SOLID CORE.\nIF YOU HAVE A FOUNDATION THAT YOU BELIEVE IN.\nHIS SIGNATURE ISSUE HAS BEEN IMMIGRATION, BUILD THE WALL,\nDEPORT 11 MILLION PEOPLE. TODAY, COULD SOMEONE PLEASE\nEXPLAIN TO ME EXACTLY WHAT HIS IMMIGRATION PLAN IS BECAUSE IT'S\nHARDENED, IT'S SOFTENED, IT'S GONE AWAY, IT'S COME BACK, ALL\nWITHIN THE SPACE OF FOUR DAYS. SO IF HE CAN'T STICK TO HIS CORE\nMESSAGE, IF HE PLAYS THE ROOM AND TRIES TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE\nROOM WANTS TO HEAR IN TERMS OF GETTING APPLAUSE OR GETTING\nLAUGHTER, WELL THEN YOU ARE GOING TO GO WHEREVER THEY WANT\nTO HEAR SO ONE DAY WE ARE NOT GOING TO BUILD THE WALL, I'M NOT\nGOING TO BUILD A WALL, NEXT DAY IT'S YOU KNOW WHAT, NO ONE'S\nAPPLAUDING FOR ME. LET'S BUILD THE WALL, AND YOU\nGET THE CHEERS. TO ME, IT SEEMS LIKE DONALD\nTRUMP AND HIS CAMPAIGN IS IN A VERY DESPERATE MOMENT, SO\nDESPERATE THAT HIS IMMIGRATION PLAN IS NONSENSE AND THIS\nOUTREACH TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND LATINO VOTERS QUITE FRANKLY\nIS A FOOL'S ERRAND AT THIS POINT.\n>> ROBERT, YOU ARE COVERING THIS CAMPAIGN FROM THE INSIDE.\nWHAT IS THE IMMIGRATION POLICY? AT ONE POINT I THINK HE ASKED\nTHE AUDIENCE TO APPLAUD FOR WHETHER THEY WANT HIM TO DO\nDEPORTATIONS OR NOT. HE'S ACTUALLY POLLING THE\nAUDIENCE TO GET HIS POLICY. DO YOU KNOW AT THIS POINT WHAT\nTHE DONALD TRUMP IMMIGRATION PLAN IS?\n>> WHAT WE ARE WATCHING IN REAL-TIME AND WE EXPERIENCE THIS\nEVERY DAY AS REPORTERS, IS A CANDIDATE WHO HITCHED HIMSELF TO\nTHIS POPULIST RIGHT WING ELEMENT OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY MORE\nTHAN A YEAR AGO AND HAS EVER SINCE REALLY ASSOCIATED WITH\nTHAT WING AND EMBRACED THAT WING.\nBUT THAT WING HAS NEVER BEEN WHO TRUMP REALLY IS.\nIT HASN'T BEEN SOMETHING HE'S CULTIVATED THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE\nOR DURING HIS POLITICAL CAREER. IT'S SOMETHING HE FOUND, HE\nEMBRACED AND HAS HELD ON TO BUT NOW IN THIS FINAL CHAPTER OF THE\nCAMPAIGN, HE'S GOING BACK AND RETHINKING DOES HE REALLY NEED\nTO EMBRACE THIS POPULIST RIGHT WING PART OF THE PARTY AS MUCH\nAS HE HAS. >> I'M GOING TO GIVE THE LAST\nWORD TO DAVID CORN, BECAUSE ROBERT IS MUCH MORE POLITE ABOUT\nCALLING THEM POPULIST AND RIGHT WING.\nEVERYONE SORT OF UNDERSTANDS WHAT BREITBART AND STEVE BANNON\nARE AND THEY ARE ALT-RIGHT. HE CLAIMS TO BE ALT-RIGHT.\nWOULD YOU AGREE THAT DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T HAVE A NATURAL\nAFFINITY WITH THEM? >> WELL, I THINK CERTAINLY FROM\nTHE BIRTHER DAYS ON, WHICH WE NOW HAVE FOUR OR FIVE YEARS\nHERE, HE HAS HAD A NATURAL AFFINITY.\nI THINK THE BIG ISSUE HERE IS THAT DONALD TRUMP I THINK\nULTIMATELY DOESN'T CARE ABOUT ANYTHING OTHER THAN DONALD\nTRUMP. AFTER A YEAR OF TALKING ABOUT\nIMMIGRATION, HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HIS POLICY IS.\nHE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE EVEN INTERESTED IN FIGURING OUT WHAT\nTO DO ABOUT 11 MILLION PEOPLE HERE.\nHE THOUGHT HE HAD AN ANSWER. NOW HE DOESN'T KNOW.\nHE'S NOT TALKED ABOUT POLICY, HE SAYS HE'S GOING TO FIX THE\nEDUCATION SYSTEM, FIX THE INNER CITIES.\nHE DOESN'T REALLY CARE. IT'S JUST ABOUT PRESENTATION AND\nABOUT DONALD TRUMP. THE ONE THING HE CARES ABOUT ARE\nPOLLS AND HOW WELL HE'S DOING, HOW MANY PEOPLE AT THE RALLIES.\nTHOSE ARE THE DETAILS YOU GET FROM A DONALD TRUMP SPEECH.\nNOTHING ABOUT POLICY OR ANYTHING THAT MATTERS TO ANYBODY ELSE.\n>> YEAH. I THINK JONATHAN IS RIGHT, HE\nALSO CARES ABOUT APPLAUSE. IF HE CARES ABOUT POLLS HE CAN'T\nBE HAVING A GOOD WEEK BECAUSE THEY AIN'T LOOKING GOOD.\nTHANK YOU GUYS VERY MUCH.",

RUDY GIULIANI SAYS HE IS\nLISTENING TO HIS INNER CIRCLE, STILL DECIDING WHAT TO DO.\nWE DON'T EXPECT HIM TO ADDRESS HERE.\nWE DO EXPECT IN THE NEXT WEEK AND A HALF, ACCORDING TO TRUMP\nHIMSELF, THAT HE WILL GIVE AN IMMIGRATION POLICY SPEECH WHERE\nWE WILL LRN ADDITIONAL DETAILS ABOUT WHERE HE WILL DECIDE TO\nSTAND IN THE END. IT IS VERY INTERESTING TO TALK\nTO TRUMP SUPPORTERS. MOST WE TALKED TO HERE AND IN\nRECENT RALLIES SAY THEY EXPECTED TRUMP WOULD SOFTEN.\nINSTEAD HE IS SAYING HE WANTS TO DEPORT EVERY ONE OF THEM, BUT\nTHERE ARE TRUMP SUPPORTERS, INCLUDING MANY HIGH PROFILE\nSUPPORTERS SAY WAFFLING IS THE WRONG THING TO DO.\n>> THANK YOU FOR THAT, JACOB.

CASEY HUNT JANES US IN WHITE\nPLANES NEW YORK WITH MORE DETAILS.\n>> HILLARY CLINTON GETTING THAT INTELLIGENCE BRIEFING AT THIS\nFBI OFFICE NEAR HER HOUSE. IT WAS ABOUTWO HOURS AND 17\nMINUTES. IT IS A COURTESY BRIEFING FOR\nNOMINEES. IT DOESN'T DIVE SO DEEPLY INTO\nFOREIGN POLICY AND NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES AS HILLARY\nCLINTON WOULD HAVE BEEN FAMILIAR WITH AS SECRETARY OF STATE, HER\nAND TRUMP WOULD HAVE RECEIVED SIMILAR TYPES OF BRIEFINGS.\nWE DIDN'T SEE ANY AIDES. THE CAMPAIGN THINKING SHE\nDOESN'T NEED ANY HELP DIGESTING THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION AS IT\nWAS NOT AS IN-DEPTH AS SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH WHEN SHE\nWAS SECRETARY OF STATE, BUT REPUBLICANS RAISED QUESTIONS\nABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE AIDES SHOULD BE PUNISHED BECAUSE THEY\nUSED HER PRIVATE E-MAIL TO KMUBLGT WITH HER WHEN SHE WAS\nSECRETARY OF STATE, BUT THAT THAT WOULD POTENTIAL I WILL BE A\nMISS HANDLING OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.\nCLINTON'S CAMPAIGN WANTS TO KEEP THE FOCUS ON THE ISSUE THEY\nBROUGHT UP IN THE LASTOUPLE DAYS.\nTHEY ARE UP WITH A NEW AD FOCUSING ON THE ISSUES.\nTHEY ARE TALKING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE GOING TO EXPAND\nTHE MAP OF STATES FOR THE FALL. IF THEY ARE FAR ENOUGH AHEAD,\nTHEY COULD SPEND IN STATES LIKE ARIZONA AND GEORGIA.\nTHEY'RE NOT GOING TO ADVERTISE IN VIRGINIA THROUGH THE FALL.\nTHE QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT THAT MIGHT BE TO ARIZONA OR\nPOTENTIALLY TO GEORGIA, TWO STATES WE NORMALLY THINK WOULD\nBE IN DONALD TRUMP'S COLUMN.",

DONALD TRUMP SAID THAT WAS MEAN\nSPIRITED. YES, HE'S CHANGING HIS POSITION\nTO A MORE MAINSTREAM POSITION. ACCORDING TO RESEARCH, 72% OF\nAMERICANS DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO BE DEPORTED EN MASSE, AS\nSUGGESTED IN THE PRIMARY. DOESN'T MEAN HE SHOULDN'T BE\nHELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR CHANGING HIS STANCE ON THE ISSUE, BECAUSE\nHE IS. >> YOU LIKE IT BETTER THAN THE\nORIGINAL STANCE, RIGHT? YES OR NO?\n>> AS MERCEDES SAID, I THINK IMMIGRATION IS A DIFFICULT\nISSUE. COMPLICATED ISSUE.\nI LIKE HIS -- I'LL GIVE HIM CREDIT WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT\nGETTING OUT CRIMINAL ILLEGAL ALIENS, VIOLENT CRIMINALS WHO\nCOMMITTED CRIMES IN THIS COUNTRY.\nTHAT HAPPENS EVERY SINGLE DAY, BY THE WAY.\nWHO ARE THEN DEPORTED AND COME BACK.\nI LIKE HIS BORDER SECURITY PLAN. YOU CAN'T DENY THAT HE HAS\nCHANGED. >> NO DENYING.\n>> JEB BUSH AND MARCO RUBIO DESERVE A LITTLE CREDIT FOR\nTRUMP'S PLAN. THEY SAID THE SAME THING.\n>> I DON'T THINK WE CAN DEFINITIVELY SAY THAT DONALD\nTRUMP HAS CHANGED A POSITION. I DON'T THINK WE KNOW WHERE HE\nIS ON THIS ISSUE. DAY BY DAY, IT SEEMS TO CHANGE\nONE WAY OR ANOTHER. BY THE END OF THE WEEK, HE WAS\nTALKING IN INTERVIEWS ABOUT PEOPLE BEING ALLOWED TO --\nSENDING PEOPLE OUT AND THEN HAVING THEM COME BACK IN.\nSO THAT INVOLVES DEPORTATION OF SOME KIND.\nHE HASN'T SPECIFIED EXACTLY WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO.\nHIS CAMPAIGN SPENT A WEEK TALKING ABOUT WAYS IN WHICH\nTHEY'RE THINKING ABOUT ADDRESSING THESE SORTS OF\nTHINGS. YOU HAVE TO BREAK DOWN THE\nIMMIGRATION ISSUE INTO TWO PARTS.\nTHERE IS THE WALL, BORDER SECURITY.\nSOMETHING HE HASN'T BACKED AWAY FROM.\nHE'S BEEN ADEQUATE ABOUT THAT IN RALLIES.\nIN INTERVIEWS, HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS SOME THINGS, DONALD TRUMP SAYS\nSOME THINGS ON THE ISSUE OF DEFORMATION.\nCANDIDATES EVOLVE ALL THE TIME, RIGHT?\nI DON'T LIKE THAT WORD BUT THAT'S WHAT WE SEE IN POLITICS.\nTHIS IS SOMEONE WHO HAS BUILT AN ENTIRE CAMPAIGN ON THE ISSUE OF\nIMMIGRATION. THE FACT THAT WE'RE 2, 2 1/2\nMONTHS AWAY FROM THE ELECTION AND YOU HAVE A CAMPAIGN STILL\nFIGURING OUT ITS POLICY ON IMMIGRATION, YOU KNOW, IS\nSOMETHING TO HIGHLIGHT. >> DAVID, YOUR THOUGHTS?\n>> MY THOUGHTS ARE, AND I'D LIKE TO STICK ON THE EVOLUTION PIECE.\nLOOK, HE'S HAD 30 YEARS OF EVOLUTION.\n>> OH, MY GOSH. HILLARY CLINTON HAD EVOLVED IN\nEVERY SINGLE ISSUE. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?\n>> YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY, MERCEDES.\n>> FROM THE TIME HE HIRED UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS TO TEAR\nDOWN THE BUILDING WHERE NOW THE TRUMP TOWER STANDS, AND KEEPING\nPAY AWAY FROM THEM, TO THE TUNE OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF\nDOLLARS, TO NOW HAVING A POLICY OF A WALL, TO NOW BEING A LITTLE\nSOFTER. COME ON, WHAT IS THE POLICY AS\nHAS BEEN MENTIONED OR ASKED? I BELIEVE THAT, OKAY, HE'S GOING\nTO BE SOFTER. >> EVOLVING POLITICIAN, YOU\nDON'T LIKE, DAVID? I'M SURE BARACK OBAMA WAS\nAGAINST GAY MARRIAGE WHEN HE WAS ELECTED MARRIAGE.\nI'M PRETTY SURE HE'S FOR IT NOW. >> HE'S GOTTEN PEOPLE SCARED\nABOUT HIS EVOLUTION. RUSH LIMBAUGH IS GOING, WHO\nWOULD HAVE THOUGHT HE WOULD HAVE BROUGHT ON AMNESTY.\nYOU HAVE THE AUTHOR OF \"IN TRUMP WE TRUST,\" WHO SAID IMMIGRATION\nWOULD BE THE POLICY HE STOOD MOST BY.\nHERE HE IS EVOLVING. >> MERCEDES AND KATIE, QUICK\nTHOUGHTS, VERY FAST, ON THE ECONOMY.\nTHE ECONOMIC FALLOUT OF THE NEW, SOFTER STANCE.\n>> WELL, IT DOESN'T JIVE WITH HIS ARGUMENT THAT WE NEED MORE\nAMERICANS TO HAVE JOBS. THE FACT IS THAT ILLEGAL\nIMMIGRANTS TAKE AWAY JOBS FROM HISPANICS IN MOSTLY MINORITY\nCOMMUNITIES. IF HE SAYS THE ILLEGAL\nIMMIGRANTS STAY HERE, HOW IS HE GOING TO SQUARE THAT WITH SAYING\nWE NEED MORE AMERICANS TO DO JOBS IN AMERICA RATHER THAN THE\nPEOPLE WHO ARE HERE ILLEGALLY? >> YOU HAVE TO BOOST THE\nECONOMY. IF YOU HAVE A 1.1% GDP GROWTH\nLIKE WE'RE SEEING TIME AND TIME AGAIN, ESPECIALLY IN THE LAST\nQUARTER, YOU REALIZE THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC\nGROWTH. PROVIDE MORE JOBS FOR AMERICANS\nIN OUR COUNTRY. >> I THINK THAT HE HASN'T REALLY\nBEEN TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMY. I THINK IF HE WERE TO FOCUS ON\nTHAT AND WRAP IT IN THE ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION, PERHAPS THAT WOULD\nBE A GOOD WAY TO GO. WE HAVEN'T SEEN A MESSAGE ON\nTHAT RECENTLY. >> DAVID?\n>> HIGH-TECH COMMUNITY, SILICON VALLEY, THEY RELY EXTREMELY ON\nIMMIGRATION.

THIS LAST WEEK THERE HAVE BEEN A\nLOT OF QUESTIONS. THE GENERAL ELECTION IS SAYING\nYOU CAN'T BE THAT HARD. WE CAN'T DEPORT 11 MILLION\nPEOPLE. >> DOES THAT REVEAL THAT THERE\nIS A PROBLEM WITH HIS MESSAGING OR A PROBLEM WITH HIS PLAN?\n>> WELL I THINK IT REVEALS A COUPLE OF CHALLENGES FOR HIM.\nNUMBER ONE, THE PLAN IS NOT THAT SPECIFIC YET.\nAND THE SECOND PROBLEM IS, HOW DOES HE APPEAL TO A BROADER\nPOPULATION IN A GENERAL ELECTION, ESPECIALLY WHEN HE\nGETS GETTING TAGGED WITH THIS BIGOT, RACIST TYPE LANGUAGE.\nHE'S TRYING TO SHIFT A LITTLE BIT.\n>> IS THAT A PROBLEM TO NOT HAVE A PLAN 11 WEEKS AWAY FROM THE\nGENERAL ELECTION, ELECTION DAY AND THIS HAS BEEN HIS BIG THING.\n>> THE PROBLEM IS HOW DO YOU COMMUNICATE THE PLAN.\nHOW DO YOU HAVE A CONSISTENT MESSAGE AND CAST ANYTIME A\nCOMPELLING WAY TO BRING IN THE BASE THAT HE NEEDS.\nIT'S A TIGHT ROPE HE'S TRYING TO WALK.\n>> YOU UNDERSCORED THE MESSAGES THROUGHOUT THIS PAST WEEK.\nBUT IF YOU LOOK OVER THE COURSE OF A TIME, JUST BY WAY OF HIS\nTWEETS, BECAUSE HE CAMPAIGNS AND HE COUNTS ON IT QUITE HEAVILY.\nTAKE A LOOK HERE. IN JUNE HE TWEET THD, WE MUST\nHAVE STRONG BORDERS AND STOP ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.\nWITHOUT THAT WE DO NOT HAVE A COUNTRY.\nALSO MEXICO IS KILLING U.S. ON TRADE.\nTHEN IN AUGUST OF 2016, JEB BUSH JUST TALKED ABOUT MY BORDER\nPROPOSAL TO BUILD A FENCE. IT'S NOT A FENCE, JEB, IT'S A\nWALL. THEN IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR, IT'S\nAMAZING HOW OFTEN I AM RIGHT THE ONLY TO BE CRITICIZED BY THE\nMEDIA. ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, TAKE THE\nOIL, BUILD THE WALL. AND FINALLY YESTERDAY, DONALD\nTRUMP TWEETING THIS, I AM VERY PROUD TO HAVE BROUGHT THE\nSUBJECT OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION BACK INTO THE DISCUSSION.\nSUCH A BIG PROBLEM FOR OUR COUNTRY.\nI WILL SOLVE. THIS WAS WHAT TRUMP YOU KNOW\nBUILT HIS ENTIRE CAMPAIGN ON, JASON.\nHAS THERE BEEN AN EVOLUTION? HAS THERE BEEN A SHIFT?\nIS IT MORE OF THE SAME? HOW DO YOU INTERPRET?\n>> NO. MOST REPUBLICANS DON'T BELIEVE\nIN THAT FORM OF EVOLUTION AND NO SMART CAMPAIGNER SHOULD EITHER.\nHE HASN'T EVOLVED ON THIS ISSUE. WHAT HE'S REALIZED IS THAT ONCE\nYOU'RE OUT OF THE PRIMARY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO START ASKING MORE\nSPECIFICS. IT'S EASY TO SAY I'M GOING TO\nBRING CHRISTMAS CANDY TO EVERYBODY WHEN THERE ARE 17\nPEOPLE YOU'RE RUNNING AGAINST BUT WHEN IT'S JUST DOWN TO TWO\nCANDIDATES PEOPLE ARE GOING TO START ASKING QUESTION, HOW ARE\nYOU GOING TO PAY FOR IT. THE PROBLEM I SEE IS HE CAN'T\nPIVOT AWAY FROM THIS. IF YOU SAY YOU'RE GOING TO BUILD\nA WALL, YOU HAVE TO BUILD THE WALL.\nIF YOU'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT 11 MILLION PEOPLE IN THIS\nCOUNTRY WHO ARE HERE ILLEGALLY, YOU CAN'T BACK OUT OF THAT.\nBUT THE PROBLEM IS HIS CAMPAIGN HASN'T COME UP WITH A POLICY\nTHAT DOESN'T SOUND DRACONIAN AND POSSIBLY MORE EXPENSIVE THAN\nLEAVING PEOPLE HERE. >> HOW DOES HIS CAMPAIGN EXPLAIN\nJUST WHAT YOU JUST SAID A MOMENT AGO, THAT HE DOESN'T SEEM TO\nHAVE A PLAN? >> HE HAD THE SPECIFIC, IT WAS\nTHE WALL AND NOW WE'RE PIVOTING AWAY FROM THAT A LITTLE BIT.\nHE'S GOT TO SHIFT THE NARRATIVE. THIS WEEK HE'S GOT TO VERY\nQUICKLY OUTLINE THE PLAN THAT SOUNDS REASONABLE BUT ALSO\nACCOMPLISHES HIS GOAL. HE SAYS THAT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION\nIS HURTING THE UNITED STATES. THAT RESONATES WITH THE MIDDLE\nCLASS PEOPLE. HE'S LOSING BECAUSE HE NEEDS TO\nBE TAKING BE ON THE OFFENSE U AGAINST HILLARY.\nOTHERWISE HE'S IN A TOUGH SHADE HEADING INTO THE HOME STRETCH\nHERE. >> BUT THAT HAS BEEN HIS FOCUS,\nTO TALK ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON, TO UNDERMINE HER CREDIBILITY,\nHER CHARACTER ET CETERA. TO THEN DABBLE INTO IMMIGRATION\nWHICH HAS BEEN THE BIG THING, YOU KNOW OF HIS CAMPAIGN AND\nTHEN PIVOT AWAY FROM THAT, IT WOULD SEEM THAT VOTERS WOULD\nWANT MORE. >> HERE'S WHAT WE'RE NOT TALKING\nABOUT. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT\nHILLARY'S CAMPAIGN. HER IMMIGRATION POLICY.\nHE'S GOT TO PIVOT TO THAT. SHE DOESN'T HAVE AN IMMIGRATION\nPOLICY UNLESS IT'S JUST OPEN BORDERS ANYBODY CAN COME.\nTHAT'S A NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE.\nIF HE CAN PIVOT AND TALK ABOUT HER LACK OF A POLICY INSTEAD OF\nHIS PIVOTING ON A POLICY, HE WOULD BE IN BETTER SHAPE.\nRIGHT NOW AS LONG AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HIM PIVOTING,\nTHAT'S NOT GOOD FOR HIS CAMPAIGN.\n>> IS THE ONUS ON DONALD TRUMP SINCE THIS HAS BEEN HIS\nBAILIWICK, IMMIGRATION, THAT THERE IS GREATER PRESSURE ON\nDONALD TRUMP TO REVEAL MORE ABOUT IMMIGRATION THAN THERE IS\nON HILLARY CLINTON. >> YEAH.\nIF YOU BRING THE ROTTEN POTATO SALAD TO THE PICNIC, YOU'RE THE\nONE THAT'S GOING TO TAKE IT. HE'S GOT TO REMOVE THIS FROM THE\nPICNIC. DONALD TRUMP STARTED THIS BY\nBASING HIS CAMPAIGN ON IMMIGRATION.\nI'VE SAID FROM THE E BEGINNING, IF HE KEPT HIS CAMPAIGN FOCUSED\nON JOBS, HILLARY CLINTON'S CORRUPTION AND NATIONAL\nSECURITY, I THINK WE WOULD BE IN A NECK IN NECK RACE RIGHT NOW.\nTHERE'S FALLOUT FROM IMMIGRATION.\nIT'S NOT JUST THAT IT'S EXPENSIVE AND DO WE REALLY WANT\nTO SEE THIS GONZALEZ ANTI-IMMIGRATION FORCE.\nBUT THE IDEA THAT MEXICANS ARE COMING HERE AND THEY'RE\nPOTENTIALLY RAPISTS AND DESTROYING THE COUNTRY, THAT\nTRICKLES DOWN TO AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS AND\nASIAN AMERICAN VOTERS. AND THINK THEY IF YOU'VE GOT THE\nHOSTILITY TOWARD MEXICANS AND LATINOS, YOU PROBABLY DON'T HAVE\nA GOOD WORD FOR US EITHER. I DON'T KNOW IF TRUMP CAN GET\nOUT OF IT IN 70 DAYS.",

WAS YOUR EXPECTATION HE WOULD\nEXPOUND DETAIL, AT LEAST TO THIS AUDIENCE, OF YOU, AT THE TABLE,\nA LITTLE BIT MORE, MORE CONCRETELY ABOUT HIS IMMIGRATION\nPLAN THAT PERHAPS HE HADN'T REVEALED WITH THE GENERAL\nPUBLIC? >> WELL, WHAT WAS SIGNIFICANT IS\nTHAT HE HAD HIS THUMB ON THE PROBLEM.\nWHICH IS HOW DO YOU DO WELL 11 MILLION THAT ARE ALREADY HERE,\nEMBEDDED IN THE ECONOMY, IN THE COUNTRY?\n>> DID HE GIVE YOU SOME IDEAS ABOUT HOW DO YOU FILL IN THE\nBLANK? HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THE 11 MILLION, THEN HE SAID WHAT?\n>> WE DISCUSSED DIFFERENT OPTIONS.\nYOU KNOW, DO THEY HAVE SOME SORT OF WORK PERMISSION BUT NOT LEGAL\nSTATUS, WHICH IS WHAT THEY HAVE UNDER DACA.\nWE DISCUSSED TOUCH BACK. INTERNAL TOUCH BACK.\nBUT, AGAIN, MOST POLITICIANS DON'T EVEN GO INTO THE WEEDS.\nTHEY JUST SAY SLOGANS LIKE -- >> HE'S NOT A POLITICIAN.\n>> HE'S NOT APLIC POLITICIAN. THAT WAS REFRESHING THAT HE WAS\nPREPARED AND DIDN'T GIVE US SLOGANS LIKE I'LL DO MORE THAN\nPRESIDENT OBAMA, WHICH IS WHAT HILLARY SAID.\nWHERE IS HER PLAN? >> OKAY, JEB BUSH, FORMER RIVAL\nOF DONALD TRUMP, YOU HEARD HIS COMMENTS EARLIER IN THE WEEK.\nHE SAID HE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS VERY TROUBLED BY WHAT DONALD\nTRUMP HAS REVEALED MOST RECENTLY.\nIN FACT, HE EVEN WENT AS FAR AS SAYING JEB BUSH SAYING THAT HE\nTHOUGHT THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS KIND OF MORPHING HIS POSITION\nDEPENDING ON WHO HE WAS TRYING TO PLEASE.\nHOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT?

I DON'T SEE THAT AT ALL.\nLET'S WAIT FOR THE PLAN TO BE UNVEILED.\nYOU KNOW, RIGHT NOW, HE'S TALKED ABOUT THE BORDER SECURITY\nASPECTS OF HIS IMMIGRATION POLICY.\nWE KNOW THAT, BUILD A WALL. WE'RE FINE WITH THAT.\nBUT LET'S WAIT TILL THE REST OF HIS POLICY GETS ANNOUNCED.\nAND I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT A BUSINESSMAN AND A COMPASSIONATE\nGENEROUS BUSINESSMAN WHO ACKNOWLEDGES THAT MOST OF THE\nIMMIGRANTS ARE MAKING GOOD CONTRIBUTIONS IS GOING TO GIVE\nUS A PLAN WE CAN ALL BE PROUD OF AND WILL MAKE US SAFER.\nONE THING THAT'S BEEN CONSISTENT THE BAD PEOPLE HAVE TO GO BACK.\nIF IT WASN'T FOR DONALD TRUMP WE WOULDN'T BE TALKING ABOUT\nIMMIGRATION OR BORDER SECURITY. >> YOU HAVEN'T BEEN PARTICULARLY\nEAGER, GIVEN THAT IT WAS A YEAR AGO THAT DONALD TRUMP MADE\nTHIS -- THE CORE OF HIS CAMPAIGN, NOW WE'RE 11 WEEKS\nAWAY FROM ELECTION DAY. AND HE HASN'T EXPLAINED IT TO\nYOU. YOU KNOW, IN A VERY INTIMATE\nSETTING OR THE GENERAL PUBLIC WITH SPECIFICITY.\nTHAT ISN'T WORRISOME TO YOU. YOU HAVEN'T HEARD DETAILS 11\nWEEKS AWAY FROM ELECTION DAY? >> FREDRICKA, I'M SUPPORTING HIM\nPRIMARILY BECAUSE I SEE HIM AS THE ONLY WAY TO IMMIGRATION\nREFORM. WHAT IF SECRETARY CLINTON WINS?\nHOW IS SHE GOING TO GET THE GOP HOUSE TO GO ALONG --\n>> YOU HAVEN'T HEARD THAT DETAIL FROM YOUR OWN CANDIDATE, ASIDE\nFROM HILLARY CLINTON RIGHT NOW ABOUT YOUR CANDIDATE, YOU KNOW,\nHE HAS YOUR EAR. AND YOU HAVEN'T HEARD THOSE\nDETAILS AND YOU HAVEN'T BEEN EAGERLY AWAITING AT THE EDGE OF\nYOUR SEAT WAITING TO HEAR MORE DETAILS?\n>> WELL, I AM EAGERLY WAITING THE ANNOUNCEMENT.\nI'M CONFIDENT THAT BECAUSE HE'S A BUSINESSMAN HE KNOWS THAT THE\nSOLUTION WILL HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE CONTRIBUTIONS\nTHEY'RE MAKING. I KNOW HE'S GOING TO BE HUMANE.\nI KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE LOADED WITH BORDER SECURITY WHICH WILL\nGET THE GOP HOUSE ON BOARD. THAT'S THE BIG PROBLEM.\nHOW DOES HILLARY GET IMMIGRATION REFORM PASSED WHEN THE HOUSE IS\nCONTROLLED BY THE REPUBLICANS? IT DOESN'T HAPPEN WITH HER.\nIT ONLY HAPPENS WITH DONALD TRUMP.\n>> YOU HEARD SOME OF THAT INTERVIEW WITH ANDERSON COOPER\nAND DONALD TRUMP THIS WEEK. AND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW\nDONALD TRUMP WOULD USE LOCAL POLICE AS PART OF HIS\nIMMIGRATION FORCE. THIS IS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY.\n>> MY FIRST DAY IN OFFICE, I AM GOING TO NOTIFY LAW ENFORCEMENT\nAUTHORITIES THAT ALL OF THE BAD DUDES -- WE HAVE A LOT OF\nTHEM -- THAT ARE HERE ILLEGALLY, THAT ARE THE HEADS OF GANGS AND\nDRUG CARTELS AND ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE, AND THERE ARE PROBABLY\nMILLIONS OF THEM, BUT CERTAINLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS.\nBIG NUMBERS. THEY'RE OUT.\nTHEY'RE OUT. EXCUSE ME.\nTHE POLICE KNOW WHO THEY ARE. I HAVE SPOKEN TO MANY POLICE.\nTHE POLICE KNOW WHO THEY ARE. THEY DEAL WITH THEM ALL THE\nTIME. >> HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT\nMEANS. THE POLICE KNOW WHO THE BAD GUYS\nARE, THEN WHY IS SOMETHING FURTHER NOT HAPPENING?\nWHAT WOULD CHANGE IF IT WERE DONALD TRUMP AS PRESIDENT?\n>> WELL, I THINK WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT IS WHAT WE HAVE\nRIGHT NOW IS DE FACTO AMNESTY. THERE'S 11 MILLION PEOPLE THAT\nHAVE NEVER BEEN FINGERPRINTED. NEVER BEEN VETTED IN ANY WAY.\nSO THEY NEED TO BE VETTED. AND SOME OF THEM, THE BAD ONES\nARE GOING TO GO BACK FOR SURE. THERE'S NO ARGUMENT THERE.\nWE DON'T WANT THEM HERE. THEY MAKE THE REST OF THE\nIMMIGRANTS LOOK BAD. SEND THEM BACK.\nTHE ONES THAT DON'T HAVE CRIMINAL RECORDS, LET'S FIGURE\nOUT A WAY TO KEEP THEM IN THE COUNTRY OR TO LEGALIZE THEM IF\nTHEY HAVE TO GO BACK. AGAIN, WE'RE HEARING NOTHING\nFROM HILLARY EXCEPT VOTE FOR US. LET'S LET DONALD RELEASE HIS\nPLAN AND LET'S HOLD HILLARY CLINTON TO THE SAME STANDARD.\nWHERE IS HER PLAN? >> OKAY, JACOB MONTY THANK YOU\nSO MUCH. I'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU BACK NEXT\nWEEKEND AFTER WE HAVE HEARD MORE DETAIL FROM DONALD TRUMP IN THE\nCOMING WEEK ABOUT THE IMMIGRATION POLICY.\nI'D LOVE TO HEAR YOUR ASSESSMENT THEN AS WELL.\n>> THANK YOU, I'M A BIG FAN. >> ALL RIGHT.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH. HOPE TO HAVE YOU BACK.\nNEXT WEEKEND MARK YOUR CALENDAR.",

WHAT IS YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF\nTRUMP'S IMMIGRATION PLAN? >> FIRST OF ALL, LET ME JUST SAY\nONE THING, THE CAMPAIGN NEVER CALLS ME AND ASKS ME TO SAY\nCERTAIN THINGS. SO WHAT I SAY IS WHAT I FEEL.\nAND I'M NOT BEING PRESSURED BY DONALD TRUMP OR ANYONE ELSE.\nLET'S GET THAT RIGHT AWAY ON THE TABLE.\n>> OKAY. >> SO I WAS WITH HIM FOR DAY\nONE, I'M STILL WITH HIM. I BELIEVE HIS POLICIES ON\nIMMIGRATION, ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, AND IT'S VERY\nCOMPLICATED. YOU KNOW, I SPENT MANY, MANY\nYEARS AS A DIRECTOR IN MEXICO CITY -- I GO GO ON AND ON.\nI KNOW WHERE THE U.S. BORDER IS. I KNOW THE PROBLEMS OVER THERE.\nAL HE'S ADDRESSING THOSE PROBLEMS.\nHE WANTS THAT WALL, WHICH IS GOOD.\nBECAUSE WE'RE BEING FLOODED WITH DRUGS AND HEROIN COMING ACROSS\nOUR BORDER. NOT JUST THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION\nPROBLEMS. SO IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED WHEN\nYOU TALK ABOUT THE, WHAT, TEN, 12 MILLION PEOPLE THAT ARE IN\nTHIS COUNTRY ACCORDING TO STATISTICS AND WHAT TO DO WITH\nTHEM. >> WHAT IS SO COMPLICATED IT?\nHE'S TALKED ABOUT A WALL. HE HAS TALKED ABOUT -- LET'S\nLISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID TO ANDERSON COOPER ON THURSDAY\nABOUT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING ACROSS AS YOU JUST\nMENTIONED. LET'S LISTEN TOGETHER HERE.\n>> 11 MILLION WHO HAVE NOT COMMITTED A CRIME --\n>> WE'RE GOING -- >> PATH TO LEGALIZATION, IS THAT\nRIGHT? >> YOU KNOW IT'S A PROCESS.\nYOU CAN'T TAKE 11 AT ONE TIME AND SAY BOOM YOU'RE GONE.\nWE HAVE TO FIND WHERE THESE PEOPLE ARE.\nNOBODY EVEN KNOWS IF IT'S 11. THERE IS NO PATH TO LEGALIZATION\nUNLESS THEY LEAVE THE COUNTRY AND COME BACK.\n>> ALL RIGHT. SO HE SAYS THERE'S NO PATH TO\nLEGALIZATION UNLESS YOU LEAVE THE COUNTRY AND COME BACK.\nHE SAYS HE WANTS TO BUILD A WALL.\nWHAT IS SO COMPLICATED ABOUT PUTTING THAT IN A CONCISE\nPOLICY? WE KNOW JEFF SESSIONS WHO IS\nKNOWN AS A BORDER HAWK IS HELPING HIM CRAFT THIS.\nARE YOU SURPRISED WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING YET?\nMAYBE WE'RE GETTING LATE IN THE GAME HERE?\n>> NO. WHEN I SAY COMPLICATED, WE HAVE\nTO FOLLOW THE LAW. HE WANTS TO FOLLOW THE LAW.\nIF THE -- YOU ARREST PEOPLE AND THEY'RE HERE ILLEGALLY, DEPORT\nTHEM. WHEN YOU HAVE 10,000 PEOPLE IN\nMY JAIL SYSTEM TURN OVER TO I.C.E. AND 39% COME BACK TO MY\nJAILS. THAT I RUN.\nAND 24 TIMES PEOPLE COME BACK SO YOU KNOW THEY ARE NOT BEING\nDEPORTED. THAT'S THE TOP PRIORITY.\nGET THESE PEOPLE OUT OF OUR COUNTRY.\nNOW, THOSE THAT ARE HERE -- >> WHEN YOU SAY THAT, WHAT DO\nYOU SAY TO HIS ARGUMENT THAT HE WANTS THEM TO LEAVE AND THEN\nTHEY CAN COME BACK LEGALLY? HOW REALISTICALLY LOGISTICAL IS\nTHAT? >> WELL, WHY NOT?\nTHE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IMMIGRATION HOMELAND SECURITY IS\nDIRECTED BY THE PRESIDENT. HE CAN PUT THE RESOURCES TO\nTHAT. WHEN YOU COME CROSS PEOPLE HERE\nILLEGALLY, SEND THEM BACK TO MEXICO, WHICH IS GREAT.\nAND LET THEM COME BACK LEGALLY. I THINK THAT'S A GOOD PROGRAM.\nBUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO KNOCK DOORS DOWN, I'M SURE HE NEVER\nSAID WE'RE GOING TO GO KNOCK DOORS DOWN AND DRAG EVERYBODY\nOUT. IT'S WHEN YOU COME IN CONTACT\nWITH THESE PEOPLE. >> SO IF HE CAME TO YOU, LET'S\nSAY, AND ASKED FOR YOUR ADVICE ON TACKLING IMMIGRATION, HOW\nWOULD YOU ADVISE HIM? >> WELL, THANKS FOR ASKING.\nBECAUSE THE SECRETARY OF STATE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT OFFICIAL\nDEALING IN INTERNATIONAL PROBLEMS NEXT TO THE PRESIDENT.\nHOW MANY TIMES HAS HILLARY AND PRESIDENT BEEN TO MEXICO CITY TO\nPUT PRESSURE TO DO SOMETHING -- >> HOW WOULD YOU ADVISE HIM?\nYOU LIVE IN A STATE WHERE THIS IS A TRUE PROBLEM.\n>> I WOULD ADVISE HIM BY BUILDING THAT WALL AND GETTING\nTOUGH WITH THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT AND I'M NOT GOING TO\nGO BACK IN HISTORY HOW WE USED TO DO IT UNDER NIXON, AND TAKE\nAWAY THEIR FOREIGN AID. HILLARY IS SAYING THE TAXPAYERS\nARE GOING TO BUILD A WALL. TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREIGN MONEY\nUNTIL THAT WALL IS BUILT. THE WALL IS IMPORTANT.\nYOU'RE NOT GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM 100%, BUT THE WALL IS\nIMPORTANT. I'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE\nDRUG TRAFFIC THAT'S COMING OVER FROM MEXICO DESTROYING OUR YOUNG\nPEOPLE. THAT'S WHY BIG CONCERN AND THE\nILLEGAL IMMIGRATION PROBLEM. >> ALL RIGHT.\nSHERIFF JOE ARPAIO THERE IN ARIZONA, ARE YOU GOING TO BE\nWITH HIM WHEN HE COMES OUT ON WEDNESDAY?\n>> I'M ALWAYS WITH HIM. >> ALL RIGHT.\nSHERIFF JOE, WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH, SIR.",

DOING THIS ON A FRIDAY.\nTHANK YOU. POLITICAL COMMENTATOR VAN JONES\nAND DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST MARIA CARDONA AND PARIS DENARD, WHO\nWAS DIRECTOR OF BLACK OUTREACH FOR GEORGE W. BUSH.\nSO GLAD TO HAVE ALL OF YOU. I WILL START WITH MISS CARDONA\nFIRST. SARAH PALIN SINCE TRUMP'S\nWISHY-WASHY STANCE ON IMMIGRATION COULD ERODE HIS\nSUPPORT. IS SHE RIGHT?\nWHY IS IT HARD FOR HIM TO STAY ON MESSAGE ON THIS ISSUE?\n>> I THINK FIRST OF ALL BECAUSE -- TWO THINGS.\nHE HAS NO CLUE WHERE HE STANDS, WHERE HE SHOULD STAND, I GUESS I\nSHOULD SAY, BECAUSE DURING THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY, IT WAS THE\nNUMBER ONE ISSUE AS TO WHY HE WON.\nWHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THE PRIMARY\nSTATES EXCEPT FOR WISCONSIN AND NEW YORK, THE MAJORITY, THE VAST\nMAJORITY OF THE TRUMP VOTERS WHO CAME OUT TO VOTE FOR HIM IN THE\nREST OF THE PRIMARY STATES DID SO BECAUSE OF HIS STANCE ON\nIMMIGRATION. AND SO HE KNEW THAT THAT WAS THE\nREASON, THAT WAS WHAT BROUGHT HIM TO THE DANCE, RIGHT, THAT\nWAS WHAT LED HIM TO WIN THE PRIMARY.\nGOING INTO A GENERAL ELECTION, I THINK NOW HE HAS PEOPLE LIKE\nKELLYANNE CONWAY WHO UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT AT LEAST 44% OF THE\nHISPANIC VOTE, HE HAS NO PATHWAY TO 270 ELECTORAL VOTES.\nBUT THE PROBLEM IS, HE DOESN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND IMMIGRATION.\nI DON'T THINK HE EVEN CARES ABOUT IMMIGRATION.\nSO THERE'S NO WAY FOR HIM TO FORMULATE SOMETHING, A PROPOSAL\nTHAT EVEN MAKES ANY SENSE. THAT EVEN HE CAN SAY LOOK, I DO\nNEED TO CHANGE THIS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.\nHE TRIED BUT THEN HE WOULD GO BACK ON THE ISSUE THAT MOST OF\nHIS SUPPORTERS -- >> I WILL GET ALICE IN.\nYOU SAID SHE DOESN'T BELIEVE HE EVEN CARES ABOUT THIS ISSUE OF\nIMMIGRATION. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?\n>> HE CERTAINLY CARES ABOUT IT. SHE'S RIGHT, THIS WAS THE CORNER\nSTONE OF HIS CAMPAIGN. JUST ASK HIM, HE WILL TELL YOU\nHE'S THE ONE THAT BROUGHT IMMIGRATION TO THE FOREFRONT OF\nTHE CONVERSATION. EVERY TIME WE WOULD HAVE A\nDEBATE AND HE WOULD SAY I'M GOING TO BUILD A WALL AND MEXICO\nWILL PAY FOR IT, I'M GOING TO DEPORT ALL THE ILLEGALS,\nEVERYONE SAID THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN, IT'S NOT POSSIBLE,\nAND HE STILL WON ANYWAY. JEB BUSH EVEN PUSHED BACK ON\nTHAT AND DONALD TRUMP CRITICIZED JEB BUSH FOR QUESTIONING WHETHER\nOR NOT HE'S ABLE TO DO THIS. HE GOT SO MANY PEOPLE TO BELIEVE\nHIM AND HIS FIRM STANCE ON IMMIGRATION AND THAT LED TO HIS\nVICTORY, EVEN TO THE POINT TO WHERE ANN COULTER HAS WRITTEN A\nBOOK ON \"IN TRUMP WE TRUST\" ON IMMIGRATION.\nUNFORTUNATELY IF HE GOES TOO FAR THE OTHER WAY HE'S GOING TO\nBETRAY THE TRUST -- >> YOU AGREE WITH SARAH PALIN\nTHAT HIS WISHY-WASHY SUPPORT ON IMMIGRATION COULD ERODE SUPPORT?\n>> THERE'S A CHANCE THAT COULD HAPPEN.\nTHIS IS SOMETHING THEY BELIEVED IN HIM FOR HIS STRONG STANCE ON\nTHIS. I DO, THOUGH, AT THE SAME TIME,\nHE DOES NEED TO BROADEN HIS BASE.\nHE NEEDS TO REACH OUT TO A BIGGER ELECTORATE.\nHE NEEDS TO BRING IN MORE HISPANICS TO THE FOLD IN ORDER\nTO WIN. BUT HE MUST BE CAREFUL IN HOW HE\nGOES ABOUT DOING IT BECAUSE IT DOES GO AGAINST THE CORNERSTONE\nOF HIS CAMPAIGN. >> HE STARTED OFF WITH\nIMMIGRATION. PARIS, WHERE ELSE DOES HE GO?\nWHERE ELSE DO TRUMP VOTERS GO IF THEY SAY OH, OKAY, WELL, YOU\nKNOW, HE SORT OF WENT AGAINST WHAT HE SAID ON IMMIGRATION.\nARE THEY GOING TO GO TO HILLARY CLINTON?\n>> NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT. TRUMP SUPPORTERS LIKE MYSELF\nYU UNDERSTAND THE FACT --\n>> WILL THAT TOP THEM FROM BEING ENERGIZED ENOUGH TO GO TO THE\nPOLLS? >> NO, BECAUSE THE ALTERNATIVE\nIS SO SEVERE. WE REALIZE HILLARY CLINTON IS\nNOT GOING TO BE OUR FRIEND AND NOT GOING TO SUPPORT THE ISSUES\nTHAT WE BELIEVE ARE IMPORTANT. SO TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS WILL BE\nWITH HIM NO MATTER WHAT. BUT I DON'T BELIEVE HE IS GOING\nTO HAVE A REVERSAL ON HIS DECISIONS OR HIS POSITION ON\nIMMIGRATION. >> OKAY.\nVAN, LISTENING OVER THE PAST COUPLE DAYS, SIMILAR QUESTION TO\nWHAT I ASKED YOU LAST NIGHT. WE HEARD A COUPLE DIFFERENT\nTHINGS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS FOR IMMIGRATION POLICY.\nI KNOW DONALD TRUMP IS SET TO DELIVER HIS BIG IMMIGRATION\nSPEECH WITHIN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS.\nDO YOU THINK WE ARE GOING TO GET MORE DETAILS AND IT'S GOING TO\nBE CLARIFIED EVEN MORE? IS HE GOING TO STICK TO THE\nOKAY, THEY MUST GO, OR IS HE GOING TO SAY WELL, WE WILL WORK\nWITH THEM? WHAT HAPPENS?\n>> I HAVE NO IDEA. I THINK WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO\nDO, THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE A BUNCH OF STATEMENTS HE MADE IN\nTHE PAST, THEY WILL THROW THEM IN A SOCK DRAWER, THEY WILL\nBLINDFOLD SOMEBODY AND GRB THEM OUT AND PUT THEM ON A WALL AND\nHE'S GOING TO GIVE THE SPEECH. >> VAN, SERIOUSLY, DOES IT SEEM\nLIKE, WHAT DO YOU THINK? WHAT DO YOU THINK?\nWHAT DO YOU THINK? THIS IS WHERE, I MEAN --\n>> HERE'S REALITY. HE IS GOING TO REALIZE THERE'S A\nDIFFERENCE BETWEEN LEADING A RALLY AND LEADING A COUNTRY.\nWHEN HE GETS UP THERE AND IT'S TIME TO LEAD A RALLY, HE'S\nBRILLIANT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU SAY AT A RALLY.\nALL YOU GOT TO DO IS GET THAT BIG APPLAUSE AND HE LOVES THAT.\nHE GETS A BIG DOPAMINE RUSH OFF OF THAT.\nBUT WHEN YOU TRY TO LEAD A COUNTRY YOU HAVE TO HAVE A\nCOHERENT SET OF IDEAS. HE HIMSELF IS ADMITTING HE\nDOESN'T HAVE ONE. HE GOES WELL, I WAS WANDERING\nAROUND THE COUNTRY AND SOMEBODY SAID THEY THOUGHT MY IDEAS WERE\nTOO TOUGH. SO NOW I'M THINKING UP NEW STUFF\nTO SAY. THIS IS DISQUALIFYING TO BE\nPRESIDENT OF THE PTA, LET ALONE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\n>> EVEN IF IT'S FRAMED AS HE'S LISTENING ON THE VOTERS AND\nHE'S -- >> BUT HE SHOULD LISTEN, THERE\nWERE VOTERS TALKING ABOUT THIS BEFORE HE RAN FOR OFFICE.\nIN FACT, THE PEOPLE WHO LISTENED TO VOTERS WERE PEOPLE LIKE JEB\nBUSH WHO CAME UP WITH GOOD IDEAS AND HE SMASHED THEM UPSIDE THE\nHEAD. >> THEY WERE PEOPLE WHO WERE ON\nPROGRAMS LIKE THIS, LIKE YOU, EVEN, LIKE MARIA, EVEN ALICE,\nWHO WERE OFFERING ADVICE AT ONE POINT, AND WERE SEEN AS NEVER\nTRUMPERS OR TRUMP HATERS. VAN, GO ON.\n>> WELL, YEAH. MY ONLY POINT IS SIMPLY THIS.\nHE CAN'T NOW GO AND SAY WELL, NOW I'M LEARNING, I'M EVOLVING,\nI'M LISTENING TO PEOPLE. YOU MIGHT WANT TO LISTEN TO THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE BEFORE YOU RUN FOR PRESIDENT.\nYOU MIGHT WANT TO LISTEN TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BEFORE YOU START\nATTACKING EVERYBODY. IT TURNS OUT SOME OF THE IDEAS\nTHAT BOTH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS HAVE HAD ARE GOOD\nIDEAS. I'M NOT MAD THAT HE NOW ADOPTS\nSOME OF THESE IDEAS BUT YOU HAVE GOT TO THEN STAND FOR IT AND SAY\nGUESS WHAT, I WAS WRONG, I APOLOGIZED, I CHANGED MY MIND.\nHE NEVER WANTS TO DO THAT. >> GO AHEAD, PARIS.\n>> THERE ARE EXAMPLES OF HILLARY CLINTON CHANGING HER MIND, HER\nPOLICY POSITIONS. >> YES, THERE ARE.\n>> SO I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP MAY, WE\nHAVEN'T HAD THE SPEECH, MAY BE DOING THAT OR SEEMS HE MIGHT BE\nDOING THAT. TO SAY IT'S DISQUALIFYING FOR\nBEING PRESIDENT. IF THAT'S THE CASE, HILLARY\nCLINTON SHOULD BE DISQUALIFIED FROM RUNNING.\n>> HAS SHE DONE IT ON CORE ISSUES?\nI'M JUST ASKING THE QUESTION. I DON'T KNOW IF SHE HAS.\n>> IT'S NOT THE FLIP-FLOP. >> HEY, DON, IN TERMS OF AN\nEXAMPLE OF A FLIP-FLOP ON A MAJOR ISSUE, THINK BACK TO 2012\nWHEN BARACK OBAMA FLIPPED ON TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE AND HE\nFLIPPED TO GAY MARRIAGE. HE DID IT BACK IN MAY.\nIT WAS QUICK, SWIFT, DECISIVE AND HE MOVED ON.\nTHAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO HERE.",

CLEARLY HE IS BACKING OFF THAT\nIDEA AND PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH HIS IDEA ABOUT A\nDEPORTATION FORCE IS THAT HE'S NEVER ADDRESSED WHAT THE COSTS\nOF THIS WOULD BE. I MEAN IT IS EXTRAORDINARILY\nEXPENSIVE ACCORDING TO EXPERTS THAT YOU TALK TO.\nOR WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO ESSENTIALLY ABOUT 5 MILLION\nIMMIGRANTS, CHILDREN, WHO ARE LEGALLY HERE IN THE U.S. WHO\nHAVE AT LEAST ONE PARENT IF THEY WERE DEPORTED.\nSO THERE IS ALL KINDS OF QUESTIONS THAT HE HASN'T\nADDRESSED AND DIDN'T ADDRESS DURING THE PRIMARY.\nI THINK HE IS GETTING A LOT MORE SCRUTINY NOW OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE\nIT IS A ONE-ON-ONE RACE BETWEEN HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP\nAND HE CAN'T WIGGLE OUT OF THESE QUESTIONS WITHOUT EXPLAINING HOW\nMUCH THIS IS GOING TO COST, WHAT HE IS GOING TO DO, AND SO WE'LL\nSEE WHAT HE SAYS IN THIS IMMIGRATION SPEECH ON WEDNESDAY.\nSOME AIDES ALSO SAID MIGHT NOT BE A NEW POLICY SPEECH.\nSO THERE IS A HUGE LACK OF CLARITY HERE AND IT MAY BE IN\nHIS INTEREST TO KEEP HIS IDEAS ON THIS PRETTY MUDDY.\n>> MAEVE, STAY WITH ME. LET ME KEEP YOUR VOICE AND BRING\nIN A FEW OTHERS. WITH ME NOW, DONALD TRUMP\nSUPPORTER CHRIS KOVAC, ALSO SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE STATE\nOF KANSAS. DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN GREGORY\nMEEKS AND CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, S.E. CUPP, A\nREPUBLICAN COMMENTATOR WHO DOES NOT SUPPORT MR. TRUMP.\nCHRIS, LET ME BEGIN WITH YOU. YOU ARE SO JERMAINE TO THIS\nWHOLE THING BECAUSE YOU HELPED DEVISE AND DRAFT THE PLAN.\nMAEVE SAYS YOU NEED A FLOW CHART.\nBUT CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME AND THE REST OF US WHAT TRUMP'S PLAN\nIS WITH THE 11 MILLION? >> SURE.\nI WOULD JUST SAY AS A POINT OF CLARIFICATION.\nTHIS WEEK WHEN HE HAD THAT INTERVIEW ON ANOTHER NETWORK\nCOUPLE DAYS AGO WHICH PEOPLE -- SOME PEOPLE TOOK AS A SOFTENING\nOF POSITION, HE USED SOME AMBIGUOUS WORD.\nSOFT SOFTENING.\nPEOPLE JUMPED AND DREW CONCLUSIONS.\nIN THE INTERVIEW WITH ANDERSON COOP ER HE SAID IT WAS THE SAME\nPOSITION HE'S HAD ALL ALONG, NO AMNESTY FOR THE 11 MILLION.\nTHERE IS A FALSE DICHOTOMY THAT SOME PEOPLE USE.\nTHEY SAY YOU EITHER HAVE TO DEPORT THEM ALL OR LET THEM ALL\nSTAY. BUT THE ANSWER IS YOU DEPORT A\nLARGE PERCENTAGE OF THEM AND MANY PEOPLE WILL GO HOME ON\nTHEIR OWN. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED WHEN\nEISENHOWER DID SO BACK IN 1954. THAT'S WHPD WHEN THE FEDERAL\nGOVERNMENT AFTER 9/11 HAD A MORE LIMBED FOCUS OF PEOPLE COMING\nFROM COUNTRIES WITH AL QAEDA PRESENCE.\nMANY PEOPLE LEFT ON THEIR OWN. I THINK WHAT TRUMP IS SAYING,\nYEAH, WE'LL BPICK A NUMBER, BUT IT MAY NOT BE 100%.\n>> CHRIS, WHEN WE TALK ABOUT GOING BACK, WE WERE DISCUSSING\nLAST HOUR GEORGE BUSH AND THE TOUCH-BACKS.\nI FEEL LIKE WE'VE HEARD SOME ITERATION OF THAT COMING OUT OF\nMR. TRUMP HAS MENTIONED. IS THAT POTENTIALLY PART OF THE\nPLAN? >> YEAH, I THINK SO.\nTHE REASON IT HAS TO BE OR AT LEAST HAS TO BE IN SOME WAY PART\nOF THE PLAN -- WHEN I SAY TOUCH-BACK, I'M NOT TALKING\nABOUT YOU LITERALLY TOUCH THE HOME COUNTRY AN THEN COME RIGHT\nBACK. TALKING ABOUT GOING TO THE HOME\nCOUNTRY AND BEING ELIGIBLE TO GET IN LINE BEHIND EVERYBODY\nELSE AND COME BACK AFTER A FEW YEARS, HOWEVER LONG THAT LINE\nMAY BE. THE REASON THAT KIND OF HAS TO\nBE PART OF IT IS YOU HAVE TO GIVE AN INCENTIVE FOR ILLEGAL\nALIENS IN THE UNITED STATES TO MAKE THE CALCULATION THEMSELVES.\nWELL, MAYBE I BETTER GO HOME, I'LL GET IN LINE, I'LL TRY TO\nCOME BACK IN A FEW YEARS. IF YOU DON'T ALLOW THEM EVER TO\nCOME BACK THEN MANY WILL TRY TO STAY IN THE UNITED STATES AND\nKEEP ON EVADING LAW ENFORCEMENT. YOU HAVE TO AT LEAST OFFER A\nPOSSIBILITY OF COMING BACK. >> CHRIS, I'LL COME BACK TO YOU.\n>> S.E., YOU TALK TO A LOT OF REPUBLICANS, YOU ARE A\nREPUBLICAN. YOU ARE WONDERING WHERE MR.\nTRUMP STANDS. YOU JUST HEARD CHRIS TRY TO LAY\nIT OUT. DO YOU FEEL ENLIGHTENED?\n>> FIRST, LET ME JUST SAY ONLY TRUMP AND HIS SUPPORTERS LOOK\nBACK ON OPERATION WETBACK WITH NOSTALGIA.\nMOST PEOPLE GENERALLY AGREE THAT WAS AN INCREDIBLY INHUMANE\nMOMENT IN OUR HISTORY AND IT WAS THE DARKEST OF OUR TIMES, NOT\nTHE BRIGHTEST. BUT THERE IS NO SPINNING TRUMP'S\nWAY OUT OF THIS. CENTERPIECE OF THIS CAMPAIGN\nFROM THE SECOND HE DESCENDED THAT ESCALATOR IN TRUMP TOWER\nWAS THEY'RE ALL GOING HOME. HE SAID IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN.\nHE SAID IT FOR MONTHS. IT'S WHY SOME TRUMP SUPPORTERS\nLIKE ANN COULTER AND SARAH PALIN ARE VERY NERVOUS AND\nDISAPPOINTED IN TRUMP'S NEW WORDS WHICH ARE INDEED DIFFERENT\nTO SAY THAT SOME WILL STAY. FOR SOME REPUBLICANS, THAT'S THE\nDEFINITION OF AMNESTY. AND WHATEVER SIDE OF THE\nIMMIGRATION DEBATE YOU FALL ON, IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT TO\nEXPLAIN THAT ALLOWING SOME UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS TO STAY\nIS NOT A TOTAL REVERSAL OF POSITION AND IS NOT AMNESTY.\n>> YOU MENTIONED SARAH PALIN. SHE TALKED TO THE \"WALL STREET\nJOURNAL.\" THIS IS WHAT SARAH PALIN SAID.\nIF MR. TRUMP WERE TO GO DOUMPB A PATH OF WISHY-WASHY POSITION\nTAKEN ON THINGS THAT THE CORE FOUNDATION OF HIS HAS SO\nAPPRECIATED AND THAT IS RESPECTING OUR CONSTITUTION AND\nRESPECTING LAW AND ORDER IN AMERICA, THEN YEAH, THERE WOULD\nBE MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT. THOSE TRUMP SUPPORTERS PILED UP\nBEHIND HIM DURING THE PRIMARY PROCESS BECAUSE THIS WAS HIS\nCORNERSTONE PIECE, THEY MAY FALL TO THE SIDE.\nCONGRESSMAN MEEKS, LET ME TURN TO YOU AS THE DEMOCRAT, THE\nHILLARY CLINTON SUPPORTER. EVEN AS RECENT AS YESTERDAY\nHILLARY CLINTON WAS SAYING TAKE MR. TRUMP AT HIS WORD.\nWHEN HE INITIALLY DESCENDED THE ESCALATOR AND MADE THE SPEECH\nAND REFERRED TO SOME MEXICANS AND DRUG DEALERS AND CRIMINALS.\nBUT ON THE FLIP SIDE IF HE DOES SOFTEN, THAT COULD BE\nTROUBLESOME FOR YOU ALL. >> NOT TROUBLESOME FOR ME.\nBECAUSE CLEARLY WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS, IS A CON MAN.\nWHAT A CON MAN DOES, HE'LL SAY ANYTHING GENERALLY FOR YOUR\nMONEY, IN THIS CASE FOR YOUR VOTE.\nHE CONNED HIS WAY INTO GETTING THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION AND\nNOW HE IS TRYING TO FLIP AROUND AND SOMETIMES HE CHANGES HIS\nMIND, NOT IN A MATTER OF MONTHS, BUT A MATTER OF DAYS AND\nSOMETIMES A MATTER EF MINUTES. AND SO WHAT HE'S DOING IS --\n>> WHAT IF HE'S EVOLVING? WHAT IF HE HAS A NEW CAMPAIGN\nMANAGER AND NEW CHIEF OF HIS CAMPAIGN AND PERHAPS IT IS A\nDIFFERENT STRATEGY FOR HIM. >> HE'S EVOLVED BEFORE.\nHE'S CHANGED CAMPAIGN MANAGERS, HE'S CHANGED PERSONNEL.\nIT IS THE SAME DONALD TRUMP. AND IT IS THE SAME THING.\nSO HE'S SHOWING YOU WHO HE IS AND WHAT HAPPENS WITH A CON MAN,\nEITHER YOU GET AWAY WITH THE CONOR YOU GET CAUGHT.\nI THINK WHAT IS STARTING TO HAPPEN, HE'S STARTING TO GET\nCAUGHT. YOU CAN'T KEEP CONNING YOURSELF\nALL THE WAY THROUGH. THAT'S WHAT HE'S DONE THUS FAR.\n>> KRIS, RESPOND TO YOUR GUY BEING CALLED A CON MAN.\n>> WELL, LOOK, I'M AS CONSERVATIVE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT\nORIENTED AS THEY COME WHEN IT COMES TO THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION\nISSUE. IF I THOUGHT DONALD TRUMP WERE\nCHANGING HIS POSITION I WOULD BE VERY UPSET AND WOULDN'T BE HERE\nDEFENDING HIS POSITION. I THINK WHAT YOU HAVE IS A\nPERSON WHO IS RUNNING FOR HIS FIRST POLITICAL OFFICE IN HIS\nLIFE AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MANY PEOPLE LIKE ABOUT TRUMP IS\nTHAT HE DOESN'T SPEAK IN WELL REHEARSED PHRASES WHERE HE\nALWAYS GOES BACK TO THE TALKING POINTS HE'S BEEN GRIFFIN.\nHE JUST SPEAKS FROM THE GUT AND HE'LL SPEAK OFF THE CUFF AND USE\nPHRASES THAT ARE AMBIGUOUS. RIGHT AFTER THAT INTERVIEW HE\nCAME BACK AND SAID, NO, THIS IS WHAT I MEAN, WE'RE STILL ON THE\nSAME POSITION HE'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT ALL ALONG WHICH IS, YES,\nWE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE 11 MILLION EVENTUALLY GO\nHOME AND WHETHER THAT MEANS YOU DEPORT THEM OR GIVE THEM\nINCENTIVES TO GO HOME, BOTTOM LINE IS THEY ARE GOING HOME.\nIN CONCLUSION I WOULD SAY, VOTERS ARE GOING TO HAVE A REAL\nCHOICE HERE. HILLARY CLINTON IS SAYING VERY\nCLEARLY SHE WANTS AMNESTY. TRUMP SAYS NO.\nHILLARY CLINTON SAYS NO WALL, TRUMP WANTS A WALL.\nTRUMP WANTS THE CONTINUED LOW-LEVEL OF ENFORCEMENT, TRUMP\nWANTS TO RAMP IT UP. VOTERS HAVE A CLEAR VOICE AND\nTHAT'S A GOOD THING FOR THE AMERICAN POLITICAL COMMUNITY.\nTHEY CAN SEE WHERE THE TWO STAND.\nTHERE IS NO QUESTION TRUMP IS TAKING A MUCH STRONGER LAW\nENFORCEMENT POSITION THAN HILLARY CLINTON.\n>> SOMEONE HE REALLY CLASHED WITH, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU WATCH\nTHE TWO ON THOSE DEBATE STAGES WAS JEB BUSH.\nNOW YOU HAVE OTHER REPUBLICANS COMPARING WHAT MR. TRUMP HAS\nBEEN SAYING TO A JEB BUSHESQUE SORT OF IMMIGRATION PLAN.\nJEB BUSH WAS ON THE RADIO YESTERDAY, JUST WANT TO PLAY A\nSNIPPET OF THAT. >> THE SIMPLE PROCESS IS A PATH\nTO LEGAL STATUS. NOT A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP.\nWHERE YOU PAY A FINE, WHERE YOU WORK, WHERE YOU DON'T RECEIVE\nGOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE, WHERE YOU LEARN ENGLISH, AND I PAY YOUR\nTAXES AND OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME YOU EARN LEGAL\nSTATUS. >> THAT SEEMS TO BE WHAT HE IS\nADVOCATING IN MANY WAYS OR WHAT HE'S SUGGESTING.\n>> WELL, I'M SURE I INFLUENCED HIS POSITION.\n>> THAT'S JEB BSH'S USH'S POLIC. >> JEB BUSH WASN'T BUILDING A\nWALL. JEB BUSH WASN'T MAKING STRONG\nBORDERS. I'M NOT KNOCKING JEB BUSH BUT I\nWAS WITH HIM FOR A LONG TIME. >> MAEVE, YOU STARTED THIS, I'M\nGOING TO END WITH YOU HERE. YOU HEARD THE RESPONSE THERE\nWITH MR. TRUMP WITH ANDERSON BUT, A PRIMARY IS ONE THING, A\nGENERAL ELECTION YOU HAVE A MUCH BROADER, MUCH WIDER AUDIENCE.\nISN'T THERE SORT OF THIS SENSE OF A GRAVITATIONAL PULL.\nI'M LISTENING TO KRIS CLOSELY ON WHAT HE'S SAYING TRUMP BELIEVES.\nBUT WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF A POTENTIAL MOVING?\n>> I JUST THINK THAT WE'RE BACK TO THE SAME PLACE THAT WE WERE\nWITH ROMNEY WHEN HE TRIED TO EXPLAIN SELF-DEPORTATION.\nSO FAR WHAT TRUMP HAS ARTICULATED DOESN'T HAVE ANY\nSTEPS LAID OUT ABOUT HOW THIS WOULD ACTUALLY ALL WORK.\nIT IS GOING TO BE INCUMBENT ON HIM ON WEDNESDAY TO EXPLAIN WHAT\nTHIS POLICY IS. >> OKAY.\nSORRY, SOMEBODY JUST GOT IN MY EAR.\nWE'LL END IT THERE BUT WE HAVE SOME SOUND -- LET'S END IT ON\nSOMETHING LIGHT BECAUSE IT IS A FRIDAY.\nI HAVE FIVE WORDS FOR YOU. STEPHEN COLBERT, TIM KAINE,\nHARMONICA. GO.\n\u00e2\u0099\u00aa \u00e2\u0099\u00aa \u00e2\u0099\u00aa >> HOW ABOUT THAT?\nWHO KNEW? WITH THAT, I WANT TO THANK\nEVERYONE. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH.\nAGAIN, WE'LL BE LISTENING VERY CLOSELY TO MR. TRUMP NEXT\nWEDNESDAY IN PHOENIX.",

              "text": ">>> WE DO NOT KNOW HILLARY\nCLINTON'S FULL SCHEDULE AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT UNTIL AFTER THE\nELECTION. ON WEDNESDAY THE A.P. PUBLISHED\nTHE FIRST SYSTEMIC EFFORT TO CALCULATE THE SCOPE OF\nINTERSECTING INTERESTS OF THE CLINTON FOUNDATION DONORS AND\nPEOPLE WHO MET WITH OR SPOKE TO SECRETARY CLINTON ABOUT THEIR\nNEEDS. THE A.P. CONCLUDED THAT MORE\nTHAN HALF, AT LEAST 85 OF 154 PEOPLE FROM PRIVATE INTERESTS\nWHO MET WITH CLINTON, WERE DONORS WHO CONTRIBUTED AS MUCH\nAS 185 MILLION DOLLARS TO THE FOUNDATION.\nTHE A.P. STORY CALLED THIS AN EXTRAORDINARY PROPORTION\nINDICATING HER POSSIBLE ETHICS CHALLENGES IF ELECTED PRESIDENT.\nAND THAT SURE SOUNDED NEFARIOUS. BUT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN CRIED\nFOUL WHEN THEY SAID THE REPORT WAS A DISTORTION NOTING THAT THE\nA.P. DID NOT INCLUDE IN ITS CALCULATIONS FOREIGN DIPLOMATS\nOR U.S. GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. HAD THEY BEEN INCLUDED, THE\nREPORT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THAT MORE THAN HALF OF HER\nINTERACTIONS WERE WITH DONORS BUT THAT A TINY FRACTION FIT THE\nDESCRIPTION. AND NOW WE HEAR, WE WON'T BE\nGETTING HILLARY'S FULL SCHEDULE UNTIL AFTER ELECTION DAY.\nSO WHAT, IF ANYTHING, DID WE JUST LEARN?\nJOINING ME NOW, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST JULIAN EPSTEIN,\nDEMOCRATIC CHIEF COUNCIL OF THE HOUSE COMMITTEE DURING BILL\nCLINTON'S IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS AND A CLOSE ASSOCIATE AND LEGAL\nADVISOR TO THE CLINTON, AND PETER SCHWEITZER, HE'S THE\nAUTHOR OF CLINTON CASH. PETER, LET ME START WITH YOU.\nWHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE IN YOUR EYES TO THIS WEEK'S REVELATIONS?\n>> WELL, I THINK THE A.P.'S STORY IS HUGELY IMPORTANT.\nAND I FIND THE CLINTON DEFENSE QUITE BIZARRE.\nTHE QUESTION IS NOT WHO SHE MEETS WITH WHEN THE GERMAN\nCHANCELLOR REQUESTS A MEETING. THAT'S PART OF HER DUTY.\nTHE QUESTION IS WHO DOES SHE CHOOSE TO GIVE ACCESS TO, WHO\nDOES SHE CHOOSE TO ALLOW TO HAVE ACCESS TO HER EAR?\nAND IT'S PRETTY CLEAR BASED ON THE A.P. EVIDENCE.\nWHEN SHE HAS CHOICES, SHE'S CHOOSING A HIGH PROPORTION OF\nCLINTON FOUNDATION DONORS. THE E-MAILS THAT HAVE COME OUT\nALSO REVEAL THAT WE HAVE NOW GONE FROM THE POINT WHERE WE HAD\nA STRANGE PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR WHERE PEOPLE WERE DONATING MONEY\nTO THE CLINTONS AND SEEMED TO GET FAVORABLE ACTION.\nWE NOW HAVE E-MAILS THAT SHOW THE CLINTON FOUNDATION AS THE\nCONDUIT. IF YOU'RE A CROWN PRINCE OR A\nBILLIONAIRE IN NIGERIA AND WANT ACCESS TO THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF\nTHE STATE DEPARTMENT, YOU DON'T NEED TO GO THROUGH OR CAN GO\nTHROUGH OFFICIAL CHANNELS, YOU SIMPLY GO THROUGH THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION. THAT IS HUGELY TROUBLING BECAUSE\nIT SHOWS THAT MONEY PROVIDES ACCESS.\nAND I THINK FURTHER EVIDENCE IS GOING TO SHOW THAT IT EQUATED\nWITH FAVORS. >> IF THE ASSOCIATED PRESS DID\nTHIS TYPE OF ANALYSIS, THIS TYPE OF DRILL-DOWN ON ANY OF THE 435\nMEMBERS OF CONGRESS OR 100 MEMBERS OF THE U.S. SENATE,\nWOULD WE NOT FIND THE EXACT SAME THING?\n>> WELL, I THINK WE WOULD. I THINK MONEY IN POLITICS IS THE\nTROUBLING ISSUE. BUT HERE'S THE HUGE MASSIVE\nDIFFERENCE, FEDERAL LAW PREVENTS A CROWN PRINCE OR A NIGERIAN\nBILLIONAIRE FROM DONATING TO A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN OR A SUPER\nPAC. THE CLINTON FOUNDATION PROVIDES\nACCESS FOR FOREIGN ENTITIES, FOREIGN INTERESTS, CORPORATIONS,\nGOVERNMENTS AND OLIGARCHS. SO IT'S NO LONGER MONEY PAY TO\nPLAY INVOLVING A AMERICANS, INVOLVING WALL STREET OR OIL\nCOMPANIES OR BIG LABOR, WE'RE NOW TALKING ABOUT FOREIGN\nINTERESTS INFLUENCING OUR NATIONAL POLITICS.\nAND PRECISELY THE REASON THAT WE HAVE FINANCIAL RESKRIXS ON\nFOREIGN ACCESS TO CAMPAIGN DONATIONS.\nTHE CLINTON FOUNDATION IS A WAY AROUND THAT.\nAND THAT IS SO TROUBLING. THE PEOPLE NOW HAVE THE FEAR OF\nOUR -- SORRY. >> BUT THAT IS ONLY IF THERE'S A\nQUID PRO QUO. AND I DON'T THINK YOU CAN\nESTABLISH BY VIRTUE OF WHAT THE A.P. REVEALED ANY SUCH FINDING?\n>> NO, BUT THE A.P. IS JUST ONE PART OF THE LARGER PATTERN.\nLOOK, IT IS VERY, VERY CLEAR. IF YOU LOOK AT THE FORMER\nGOVERNOR DOWN IN ALABAMA, SEAGLEMAN, IF YOU LOOK AT\nSENATOR MENENDEZ, THERE ARE PEOPLE IN JAIL OR BEING\nPROSECUTED ON FAR LESS EVIDENCE. THIS NOTION THAT CIRCUMSTANTIAL\nEVIDENCE DOESN'T APPLY, IT'S NOT RELEVANT.\nTHAT IS RIDICULOUS. SO I THINK THE A.P. STORY IS\nPART OF THE LARGER PATTERN THAT EXISTS.\nAND THAT IS WHY THIS DEMANDS AN INDEPENDENT COUNCIL TO\nINVESTIGATE THE MATTERS. SOMEONE APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT\nOBAMA WHO COULD ASSESS THESE ISSUES AND EVALUATE THEM FULLY\nAND TAKE THEM OUT OF THE POLITICAL REALM.\n>> A FINAL QUESTION FOR YOU AND ONE I'VE ASKED YOU ON NUMEROUS\nOCCASIONS. IS THERE A SMOKING GUN HERE?\nAND IF SO, WHAT IS IT? >> I THINK THE SMOKING GUN IS\nHERE. YOU SEE THE FLOW OF MONEY, YOU\nSEE FAVORS DONE AND YOU NOW SEE THE COMMUNICATION TAKING PLACE.\nI THINK IF YOU PUT THIS IN FRONT OF A JURY AS IS DONE IN\nPOLITICAL CASES ELSEWHERE, I THIS THINK THE CLINTONS WOULD\nFACE JEOPARDY. I'M NOT CALLING FOR A TRIAL, BUT\nI'M SAYING THERE SHOULD BE AN INDEPENDENT COUNCIL TO EVALUATE\nTHE THINGS TO PUT PEOPLE UNDER SUBPOENA.\n>> PETER SCHWEIZER, THANK YOU. LET'S GET THE FLIP SIDE, JULIAN\nEPSTEIN, PART OF THE COUNCIL DURING BILL CLINTON'S\nIMPEACHMENT. AND AN ADVISOR TO HILLARY\nCLINTON. IF WE ADD IN HER MEETINGS WITH\nFOREIGN DIGNITARIES AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, AND IF, IN\nFACT, THE NUMBER OF MEETINGS IS A UNIVERSE OF 1700, THE FACT\nREMAINS THAT 85 PEOPLE WHO WERE BIG DONORS TO THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION HAD THEIR ACCESS TO HER FACILITATED BY VIRTUE OF\nTHAT RELATIONSHIP. ISN'T THAT IN AND OF ITSELF IS A\nPROBLEM? >> I DON'T THINK ANY OF THE\nFACTS SHOW THAT, MICHAEL. I THINK THAT THERE IN ALL OF THE\nA.P. REPORTING THERE IS NO SUGGESTION WHATSOEVER THAT ANY\nOF THE MEETINGS THAT SECRETARY CLINTON HAD WITH PRIVATE\nINTERESTS, WHETHER DONORS OR NOT DONORS, WERE SOMEHOW\nINAPPROPRIATE. AND I THINK YOUR PREVIOUS GUEST\nMR. SCHWEIZER IS CLEARLY INTERESTED IN SELLING A LOT OF\nBOOKS. BUT LIKE A LOT OF CRITICS OF\nHILLARY CLINTON HIS ARGUMENTS ARE HALF-BAKED AND HE'S UNABLE\nTO BACK THEM UP WITH SERIOUS LEGAL ANALYSIS WHATSOEVER.\nHE CALLS FOR AN INDEPENDENT COUNCIL, SAYS ETHICS VIOLATIONS,\nYOU KNOW IN ALL YOUR DISCUSSION WITH HIM HE WAS UNABLE TO CITE A\nSINGLE EXAMPLE IN WHICH ANY PARTICULAR FAVOR WAS PROVIDED\nAND EXCHANGED FOR A DONATION TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nHE WAS UNABLE TO PROVIDE ANY LEGAL ANALYSIS.\nTHE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THE A.P. REPORTING, REGARDLESS OF\nWHAT THE DATA SHOW, AND THE DATA AND THE A.P. STORY IS VERY\nINCOMPLETE. THE AMOUNT OF CONTRIBUTORS THAT\nSHE MET WITH, THE CLINTON FOUNDATION CONTRIBUTED WITH,\nWERE PROBABLY LESS THAN 5% OF THE OVERALL MEETINGS.\nBUT REGARDLESS OF THE STATS AS YOU SAY, THE 85 OR SO CLINTON\nFOUNDATION CONTRIBUTORS THAT SHE DID MEET WITH, THERE'S NO\nSUGGESTION WHATSOEVER THAT ANY OF THOSE MEETINGS WERE IN ANY\nWAY INAPPROPRIATE, THAT ANY SPECIAL FAVORS WERE GIVEN.\nSHE WAS MEETING WITH PEOPLE LIKE THE MELINDA GATES AND HER\nFOUNDATION, PEOPLE THAT WERE DOING, TRYING TO FIND ECONOMIC\nCAPITAL FOR UNDERPRIVILEGED AREAS AROUND THE WORLD.\nJUST NO SUGGESTION WHATSOEVER THERE WAS ANY WRONGDOING.\nAND MR. SCHWEIZER COMES ON TO MAKE A LOT OF RECKLESS\nALLEGATIONS TO SELL BOOKS. BUT HIS LEGAL ANALYZING IS VERY\nIMMATURE LIKE THE E-MAIL CONTROVERSY.\nCRITICS LIKE MR. SCHWEIZER MADE MONTHS AND YEARS SAYING HILLARY\nCLINTON VIOLATED CRIMINAL LAWS AND YOU HAVE THE HEAD OF THE\nREPUBLICAN -- THE REPUBLICAN HEAD OF THE FBI, MR. COMEY, WHO\nCAME OUT TO SAY THERE WAS NO BASIS TO SAY SHE VIOLATED\nCRIMINAL LAWS IN THE USE OF E-MAILS.\nTHERE'S NO THERE THERE. >> SO MANY OF THESE ARE IN THE\nEYE OF THE BEHOLDER. I DON'T WANT TO LOSE CNN VIEWERS\nIN THE WEEDS, BUT MUHAMMAD EUNICE, TO THE HILLARY\nSUPPORTERS, HERE IS A 2006 NOBEL PEACE PRIZE WINNER, OF COURSE\nOUR SECRETARY OF STATE WOULD MEET WITH SUCH AN INDIVIDUAL,\nBUT YOU DELVE A LITTLE DEEPER AND FIND OUT HE'S A BANGLADESHI\nBUSINESSMAN BEING SCRUTINIZED BY THEIR GOVERNMENT AT A TIME WHEN\nHE'S GETTING ACCESS TO OUR SECRETARY OF STATE.\nAND YOU SAY, GEEZ, I WONDER IF THAT'S CONNECTED?\nHE WRITES A BIG CHECK OR HAS A BIG CHECK WRITTEN TO THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION. WHEN HE'S JAMMED UP IN\nBANG BANGLADESH, HE'S GOT THE EAR OF\nOUR SECRETARY OF STATE. THAT SOUNDS ON THE SURFACE THAT\nIT'S DESERVING OF MORE SCRUTINY. >> PERHAPS MORE DESERVING OF\nSCRUTINY, HE'S A NOBEL PRIZE WINNER ATTEMPTING TO GET\nFINANCING INTO AND HUGELY IMPORTANT WORK IN TERMS OF\nFINDING MICROFINANCING INTO UNDERINDIVIDUALED AREAS IN\nBANGLADESH AND ELSEWHERE. THE FACT THAT HE WOULDN'T HAVE\nLEGITIMATE BUSINESS TO DISCUSS WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT ON ITS\nFACE IS JUST WRONG. CAN SOMEBODY, CAN A SKEPTIC COME\nOUT TO SAY, WELL, THERE WAS -- THERE MAY BE SOME REASON TO\nEXPLORE THIS FURTHER? SURE.\nTHEY COULD MAKE THE POINT THAT YOU MADE.\nBUT LET ME JUST SAY THAT BETWEEN THE E-MAIL CONVERSATION AND THE\nSCHEDULE CONTROVERSY, THE AMOUNT OF ATTENTION GIVEN TO HER\nE-MAILS IS UNPRECEDENT. COMPARE THIS TO DONALD TRUMP, HE\nWON'T RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS OR PERSONAL INFORMATION.\nWHY IS THAT RELEVANT? WELL, BECAUSE ACCORDING TO\nNUMEROUS REPORTS, HE'S GONE FROM $300 MILLION IN DEBT, DONALD\nTRUMP THAT IS, TO $650 MILLION IN DEBT.\nMUCH OF WHICH IS CONTROLLED, THE DEBT, THAT IS, CONTROLLED BY\nINTERESTS SYMPATHETIC TO THE RUSSIANS.\nAND DIRECT RUSSIA AS WELL. >> I'M GETTING TO THAT IN MY\nNEXT SEGMENT. >> FAIR ENOUGH.\n>> LET ME JUST SAY BECAUSE WE ARE SHORT ON TIME, SOMETIMES I\nBELIEVE SHE'S HER OWN WORST ENEMY.\nWHY SHOULD THE PUBLIC NOT HAVE BEFORE THE ELECTION ACCESS TO\nHER CALENDAR AS SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE?\nI DON'T THINK SHE'S WELL SERVED BY RECENT EVENTS WHERE THE\nGOVERNMENT SAYS WE CAN'T TURN IT AROUND QUICKLY ENOUGH.\nTHAT ENTIRE BROOKLYN OPERATION RIGHT NOW AUGHT TO BE PITCHING\nIN, GOING THROUGH A PAGE AT A TIME AND PUTTING IT OUT FOR\nPUBLIC INSPECTION. YOU GET THE FINAL QUICK WORD.\n>> WELL, THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION, MICHAEL, BUT IT'S NOT THE\nBROOKLYN OPERATION'S DECISION. THIS IS A DECISION BY THE STATE\nDEPARTMENT AND A NEGOTIATION WITH THE JUDGE AND A NEGOTIATION\nWITH A.P. THE JUDGE HAS ORDERED 600 PAGES\nPER MONTH TO BE RELEASED. THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN\nDOING THAT AND THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THE JUDGE WILL SPEED UP\nTHE SCHEDULE AND THE JUDGE WANTS TO SPEED UP THE SCHEDULE AND IT\nMAY. THE BOTTOM LINE AGAIN IS THAT\nTHE VIEWERS MUST UNDERSTAND, NOBODY, NOBODY, NOBODY HAS MADE\nA PERSUASIVE CASE WHATSOEVER THAT ANY OF HILLARY CLINTON'S\nMEETINGS, WHETHER THEY WERE WITH PUBLIC OR PRIVATE OFFICIALS WERE\nIN ANY WAY APPROPRIATE, DID ANY WRONGDOING OCCUR, ANY QUID PRO\nQUO OCCUR, ANYTHING CLOSE TO AN ETHICAL VIOLATION.\n>> THANK YOU FOR THAT. >> THE CRITICS ARE SO FAR AWAY\nFROM SERIOUS ANALYSIS IT'S NOT FUNNY.\n>> I'VE GOT TO MOVE. UP AHEAD, THANK YOU, JULIAN.\nTHE REPORTER WHO LITERALLY WROTE THE BOOK ON DONALD TRUMP AFTER\nCOVERING HIS BUSINESS DEALINGS FOR 30 YEARS IS HERE WITH\nAMAZING DETAILS OF HOW TRUMP",

              "text": ">>> I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT\nONE OF THE CRITICISMS THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS GETTING.\nTHAT HAS TO DO WITH THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nSHE SPOKE ABOUT THIS TODAY. SHE DEFENDED THE WORK OF THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION. WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO MAKE MOVES\nIF SHE'S ELECTED TO BILL CLINTON WILL NO LONGER BE ON THE BOARD\nAND FOREIGN AND CORPORATE DONATIONS WILL NOT BE GOING TO\nTHE CLINTON FOUNDATION. SHE SAID SOMETHING THAT I FOUND\nSURPRISING. SHE SAID IT TAKES TIME TO WIND\nTHIS DOWN. WHY DIDN'T SHE DO THIS SOONER?\nWHY DOESN'T SHE TURN THIS OFF NOW?\nSHE'S HAD TIME. I'VE BEEN COVERING HER FOR TWO\nYEARS. WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG?\n>> I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY IMAGINED THAT THINGS WOULD BE\nBLOWN UP IN THE WAY THEY HAVE BEEN.\nEVERYBODY ASSUMED BECAUSE THE CLINTON FOUNDATION DOES REALLY\nGOOD WORK AND BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN PRAISED AND GOTTEN AN A\nTHROUGH CHARITY WATCH AND ALL THE REVIEW GROUPS THAT LOOK AT\nHOW THEY SPEND THEIR MONEY BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON DIDN'T\nGET ONE DIME FROM THE FOUNDATION.\nNEITHER DID BILL CLINTON. NEITHER DOES CHELSEA CLINTON.\nMY GUESS IS PEOPLE ASSUME THAT THIS WOULD BE A GOOD THING AND\nNOT TURN OUT TO BE THE CONTROVERSY THAT IT HAS.\nSHE DID SAY TODAY AND WHAT SHE HAS SAID IS THEY'RE GOING TO\nREMOVE ANY QUESTION ABOUT ANY CONFLICT.\n>> THEY WERE AWARE. I GUESS I TAKE ISSUE WITH THAT\nBECAUSE I KNOW THERE WAS AN AWARENESS ALONG TIME AGO THIS\nWAS GOING TO BE AN ISSUE. >> I DON'T KNOW OPINION WHEN\nYOU'RE SECRETARY OF STATE THERE'S AN APPEAL TO SOMEBODY\nHIGHER, WHICH IS THE PRESIDENT. WHEN YOU'RE PRESIDENT, THERE'S\nNOT. THAT'S WHY THEY'RE TAKING THESE\nADDITIONAL STEPS TO MAKE SURE THERE'S THE APPEARANCE OF ANY\nCONFLICT. IT IS INTERESTING TO ME AND\nTHOSE ON THIS SIDE OF THINGS THAT WHEN THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT\nPOTENTIAL CONFLICT SBOOS THE FUTURE, WHY ISN'T ANYBODY\nTALKING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S ENTERPRISE AND THE FACT HE'S GOT\n$160 MILLION IN LOANS TO THE BANK OF CHINA AND HOW THAT WOULD\nBE WOUND DOWN. >> WE DO TALK ABOUT THAT.\nI WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\n>> I GET THAT. IT'S JUST AN INTERESTING THING.\nTHEY'RE MAKING A PROFIT AND THE CLINTONS ARE NOT MAKING ANY\nPROFIT. >> THERE IS THIS APPEARANCE OF\nPEOPLE MAKING DONATIONS WITH PERHAPS THE EXPECTATION, PERHAPS\nNOT, IT'S THE POSSIBILITY OF TRYING TO CURRY FAVOR.\nTHAT'S THE ISSUE PEOPLE ARE PRETTY WELL AWARE OF.\n>> NOBODY HAS SAID THAT ANYBODY GOT SOMETHING AS A RESULT OF\nTHAT. WHAT DID MA LINDA GATES GET, SHE\nGOT THE ABILITY TO RESOLVE MORE GLOBAL HEALTH ISSUES.\n>> THEY GOT HAVE GOTTEN ACCESS WAS THE CONCERN.\n>> I'M SURE MALINDA GATES HAS MET WITH OTHER SECRETARIES OF\nSTATE. >> SAME THING.\nEVEN WITH MAC AIDS FOUNDATION, MAC COSMETICS THAT'S A\nSUBSIDIARY OF ESTE LAUDER. THE CEO CAME IN AND WANTED TO DO\nWORK WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY REDUCED\nAIDS. IT'S THE AIDS FOUNDATION.\nTHEY WORKED WITH PET FAIR AND PRESIDENT BUSH.\nTHEY'RE ALL WORKING IS IN PUBLIC, PRIVATE OR FOUNDATION,\nPUBLIC PARTNERSHIPS TO SOLVE THE WORLD'S BIGGEST PROBLEMS.\nTO REDUCE THEM TO THE NOTION THEY WERE A DONOR AND THAT'S WHY\nTHEY GOT ACCESS IS QUITE IN INSULTING TO THEM AND NOT TO\nMENTION THE CAUSES THEY ARE TRYING TO BRING CURES TO.\n>> I'VE BEEN HEARING SOME HILLARY CLINTON SUPPORTERS,\nPEOPLE ON THE CAMPAIGN EVEN THAT ARE SAYING WHEN PEOPLE ARE\nRAISING QUESTION, REAL QUESTIONS, OR EVEN CRITICISM OF\nTHE CLINTON FOUNDATION THAT THEY ARE EQUATING THAT WITH WANTING\nTO SHUT DOWN THEIR WORK. THEY DO DO GOOD WORK WHEN IT\nCOMES TO PROVIDING HIV MEDICATIONS TO MILLIONS OF\nPEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD AT A REDUCED COST.\nTHIS IDEA OF EQUATING THAT THAT IF YOU RAISE A QUESTION OR YOU\nCRITICIZE THE FOUNDATION THAT'S SOMEONE WANTING TO TAKE AWAY THE\nAIDS MEDICATION FOR SOMEONE. IS THAT REALLY APPROPRIATE?\n>> NO. THIS IS A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN.\nOF COURSE, EVERYTHING IS FAIR GAME.\nTO SUGGEST THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE DOING THIS WORK OR THAT\nSOMEHOW THE WORK WAS NOT GOOD WORK, OF COURSE, THEY'RE GOING\nTO PUSH BACK ON THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE PROUD OF THE WORK\nTHEY'VE DONE. 50,000 KIDS EVERY YEAR WHOSE\nLIVES ARE SAVED. WHY WOULDN'T THEY BE PROUD OF\nTHAT AND WANT THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN WHAT THE FOUNDATION\nDOES. >> BILL CLINTON HAS SAID THERE'S\nLEGITIMATE CONCERNS. I GUESS I'M GETTING AT THE POINT\nIT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE ARE MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS THAT\nARE APPROPRIATE. >> YEAH.\nIT LOOKS LIKE THE FOUNDATION HAS HEARD AND HAS TAKEN STEPS TO\nCURE WHAT MIGHT BE FUTURE PERCEIVED CONFLICTS BY NOT\nTAKING ANY FOREIGN DONATION, CORPORATE DONATIONS AND ONLY\nWORKING WITH U.S. PHILANTHROPY AND DONORS.\n>> YOU HAVE THE CLINTON HEALTH ACCESS NIINITIATIVE THAT HAS A\nSEPARATE BOARD. THEY HAVEN'T DECIDED WHAT HAD TO\nDO AT THIS POINT? >> RIGHT.\nWHAT THEY SAID WHAT HAS THEY ARE LOOKING AT ALL OF THAT.\nIT IS A TOTALLY SEPARATE BOARD. IT'S BEEN SPUN OFF.\nTHE QUESTION IS ARE THEY BEING RESPONSIVE TO THE CONCERNS THAT\nTHEY ARE HEARING? YES, THEY ARE.\nDOES THE CLINTON FOUNDATION DO GREAT WORK?\nYES, IT DOES. HOW CAN THAT WORK CONTINUE WITH\nHER AS PRESIDENT AND BILL CLINTON AS THE FIRST GENTLEMAN?\nTHAT'S WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT.\nTHEY SAY THEY WILL DEAL WITH IT. THEY DO NOT WANT TO TAKE OFFICE\nWITH PERCEIVED CONFLICTS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT OVER THEIR\nHEAD. THEY ALSO DON'T WANT TO STOP THE\nWORK THAT'S BEING DONE TO STAVE LIVES.\n>> OVER 200 DAYS SINCE SHE'S HAD A PRESS CONFERENCE.\nYOU THINK SHE SHOULD GIVE ONE SOON?\n>> ALL RIGHT. SHE'S BEEN ON ALL OF Y'ALL ALL\nTHIS TIME. SHE'S GOING TO DECIDE WHETHER TO\nDO THAT. THEY'RE EVALUATING IT ALL THE\nTIME. I'M SURE SOME TIME SOON A PRESS\nCONFERENCE WILL HAPPEN. IT'S NOT LIKE SHE'S UNREACHABLE.\nIT'S LIKE NOT SHE'S NOT BEEN AVAILABLE.\nI DO THINK THIS IS MORE OF A PRESS ISSUE RATHER THAN THE\nPUBLIC. PUBLIC HEARS HER AND SEES HER.\n>> PART OF IT IS AN ACCOUNTABILITY ISSUE.\n>> SHE CALLED INTO MORNING JOE THIS MORNING.\nSHE WAS ON ANDERSON THE OTHER NIGHT.\nSHE'S ON ON YOUR NETWORK. >> TAKING QUESTIONS FROM\nREPORTERS WHO FOLLOW HER EVERY SINGLE WORD, WHO KNOW ESPECIALLY\nEVEN KNOW WHERE SHE IS ON POLICIES SO THEY CAN REALLY DO\nMORE OF A DEEP DIVE ON THIS. IT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK A\nLOT OF AMERICAN VOTERS COULD BENEFIT FROM.\nANDERSON KNOWS WHAT TO ASK HER. >> I'M NOT GIVING MY TEAM SHORT\nTRIP. I AM SAYING WHEN THERE ARE MORE\nOPPORTUNITIES FOR QUESTIONS AND THERE'S NOT BEEN A TON.\nTHEN YOU HAVE MORE -- YOU GET TO MORE.\nYOU GET TO MORE SUBJECTS. >> I GET IT.\nI GET IT. >> THESE 300 PLUS INTERVIEWS, A\nFIFTH OF THEM, ACCORDING TO NPR, AREN'T EVEN WITH JOURNALISTS AND\nMOST ARE QUICK LITTLE INTERVIEWS BETWEEN THREE AND EIGHT MINUTES\nWHERE YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH GETTING TO VERY LITTLE.\n>> WELL, I DO KNOW THIS, THAT THE PUBLIC HAS SEEN A LOT OF HER\nAND THEY WILL CONTINUE TO SEE A LOT OF HER.\nOBVIOUSLY, IT'S THE CAMPAIGN'S CALL ABOUT WHETHER THEY WILL DO\nPRESS CONFERENCE VERSUS INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWS.\nPEOPLE WILL SEE A DEBATE THAT WILL HAVE A LENGTHY TIME WHERE\nYOU'LL BE ABLE TO COMPARE AND CONTRAST WITH A REALLY SHARP\nMODERATOR WHAT THE TWO CANDIDATES STAND FOR.\nIT'S NOT THE LAST -- IT'S NOT LIKE SHE'S IN A BUBBLE.\nSHE'S EXPOSED. YOU WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE ACCESS\nTO HER AND THE QUESTION IS DO YOU DO IT AS A GROUP OR\nINDIVIDUALLY, THAT WILL BE THE CAMPAIGN'S CALL.\n>> IT FEELS A LITTLE BUBBLY TO ME.\nI'M DEFINITELY NOTING WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THERE.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING THE TIME TO BE WITH US.\n>> THANKS.",

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS REPORTED\nSOME OF THE NONGOVERNMENT PEOPLE CLINTON MET WITH AT THE STATE\nDEPARTMENT ALSO DONATED MONEY TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nTHE CLINTON CAMP SAID THE REPORT DISTORTED THE REALITY OF THE\nSITUATION. LET'S BRING IN BILL RICHARDSON,\nFORMER AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS, FORMER GOVERNOR OF NEW\nMEXICO AND MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR. OTHER THINGS AS WELL.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH. FORMER SECRETARY OF ENERGY.\nLET'S TALK ABOUT ALL THE THINGS ALL TOGETHER HERE.\nEXPLAIN FIRST, BILL, WHAT IS THE ISSUE HERE.\nWHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED WITH REGARD TO A QUID PRO QUO THING?\n>> WELL, I DON'T THINK IT IS A QUID PRO QUO, ALEX.\nI THINK FORMER PRESIDENTS LIKE BILL CLINTON, WHAT DO THEY DO\nWHEN THEY LEAVE OFFICE? SET UP LIBRARIES, FOUNDATIONS.\nWHAT DOES THE CLINTON FOUNDATION DO?\nTHEY HELP PEOPLE. THEY HELP ENDEMIC DISEASES IN\nAFRICA, HEALTH CARE AROUND THE WORLD.\nSOME OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT DONATED WANT REFERRALS.\nSIMPLE REFERRALS TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT.\nTHEY CALL. I MEAN, THE STATE DEPARTMENT\nHANDLES INTERNATIONAL ISSUES. ONE EXAMPLE IN THAT DISTORTED\nREPORT WAS MOHAMED UNIS, HERE IS A MAN WHO HAS STARTED THE\nENTREPRENEUR SHIP FOR WOMEN PROGRAM IN BANGLADESH.\nTHOUSANDS OF JOBS. HE WAS BEING HARASSED BY HIS OWN\nGOVERNMENT. HE WENT TO THE STATE GOVERNMENT\nTO GET SOME HELP. HE WENT TO SECRETARY CLINTON.\nI KNOW MOHAMED, NOBEL PRIZE WINNER.\nTHIS IS NOT PAY FOR PLAY. THIS IS NORMAL GOVERNMENT\nACTIVITY OF REFERRALS. GETTING THINGS DONE.\nTHERE IS NOTHING NEFARIOUS. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT ANY CASE-BY-CASE.\nI DON'T THINK ANY FAVORS WERE GIVEN TO ANYBODY.\n>> SO YOUR WORK AS AN AMBASSADOR.\nYOUR WORK IN THE DIP LO PAT TICK SPHERE.\nYOU ARE SAYING IT'S NORMAL FOR SOMEONE WHO DONATED TO GET FACE\nTIME. IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING?\n>> WELL, NO. LOOK.\nYOU RECEIVE PEOPLE YOU KNOW. THERE IS NO PAY FOR PLAY.\nLIKE I NEVER GOT A BIG DONOR TO ME.\nI NEVER GAVE HIM SPECIALS. WHAT I WOULD DO IS AS A GOVERNOR\nI WOULD MEET WITH WHOEVER WANTED TO MEET WITH ME.\nI WOULD HAVE SESSIONS FOR FIVE MINUTES, ANYBODY THAT WANTS TO\nMEET WITH ME. AND I THINK THE NORMAL COURSE OF\nGOVERNMENT IS THERE ARE CERTAIN PEOPLE THAT WANT ACCESS TO THE\nPRINCIPAL AND THEY ARE SUPPORTIVE.\nTHEY ARE ENGAGED IN THE ISSUE AND THE CANDIDATE OR THE\nSECRETARY OR THE POLITICIAN KNOWS HIM.\nSO THEY HAVE AN ACCESS. JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE ACCESS\nDOESN'T MEAN YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING NEFARIOUS.\n>> OF COURSE. WOULD SECRETARY CLINTON HAVE\nNECESSARILY KNOWN THE PEOPLE WITH WHOM SHE WAS MEETING WERE\nDONORS? WHEN YOU WERE GOVERNOR AND YOU\nHAD FIVE MINUTES WITH ANYBODY WHO WANTED TO MEET YOU, WOULD\nYOU BE PREPPED ON THAT? WOULD YOU KNOW THEY HAD DONATED\nMONEY TO THE CAMPAIGN, FOR EXAMPLE?\n>> NO, I WOULDN'T KNOW. THEY WOULD JUST SIGN UP.\nYOU KNOW, THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE THAT WOULD SIGN UP.\n>> THAT'S DIFFERENT THOUGH. GETTING INTO THE STATE\nDEPARTMENT TO MEET WITH HILLARY CLINTON WILL BE DIFFERENT.\nMORE THAN SIGNING UP. WOULD SHE HAVE KNOWN?\n>> YEAH, BUT LOOK AT THE OTHER CASES.\nTHERE WAS A REFERRAL OF A HEAD OF STATE.\nI MEAN, A HEAD OF STATE. I THINK IT WAS BAHRAIN.\nHE CAN GET INTO THE STATE DEPARTMENT ANYWAY.\nHE WAS A DONOR OF THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nYOU KNOW, THIS IS A MAJOR PLAYER IN THE MIDDLE EAST.\nSO YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT IT CASE-BY-CASE.\nI DON'T THINK IT'S THAT BIG OF AN ISSUE.\nWHAT'S NOT BEEN EXAMINED IS THE CLINTON FOUNDATION DID A LOT OF\nGOOD THINGS. A LOT OF GOOD THINGS AROUND THE\nWORLD. I SAW ONE OF THE PROJECTS IN\nMORACCO IN POPULATION CONTROL. IN HEALTH CARE FOR WOMEN.\nENTREPRENEURSHIP AND PANDEMIC DISEASES, CHOLERA.\nHAITI. THEY DO A LOT OF GOOD WORK.\n>> SO MY QUESTION TO YOU POLITICALLY SPEAKING, HOW DOES\nHILLARY CLINTON HANDLE THIS? I MEAN, YOU HAVE COME OUT.\nYOU'RE DEFENDING HER. BUT HOW DOES SHE HANDLE THIS\nGOING FORWARD? WHAT SHOULD SHE DO?\n>> WELL, I THINK, LOOK, THIS IS PROBABLY GOING TO CONTINUE.\nTHERE IS GOING TO BE MORE E-MAILS RELEASED.\nI THINK YOU EXPLAIN, ONE, THE FOUNDATION DOES VERY GOOD\nTHINGS. NUMBER TWO, NO PAY FOR PLAY.\nNO SPECIAL ACCESS WAS GIVEN TO ANYBODY.\nAND NUMBER THREE, NOTHING NEFARIOUS, NOTHING CONTRARY TO\nAMERICANOREIGN POLICY INTEREST WAS EXERCISED BECAUSE OF THIS\nEFFORT. I THINK IT IS VERY SIMPLE.\nBUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE AS AN ISSUE BECAUSE\nMORE E-MAILS ARE GOING TO COME OUT.\nAND THEN BAD REPORTS. I MEAN THE ASSOCIATED PRESS IS A\nVERY GOOD INSTITUTION. TO COME OUT SAYING FOR INSTANCE,\nMOHAMED YUNIS FROM BANGLADESH, THAT HE'S SPECIAL ACCESS.\nTHE GUY IS LIKE A SAINT. NOBEL PRIZE WINNER, HELPS WOMEN.\nHE WAS BEING HARASSED BY HIS OWN GOVERNMENT.\nTHEY WANTED TO PUT HIM IN JAIL. SO HE WENT FOR SOME HELP FROM\nTHE STATE DEPARTMENT. THAT'S A NORMAL TRANSACTION.\n>> ALL RIGHT. BILL RICHARDSON, ALWAYS GOOD TO\nGET YOUR PERSPECTIVE. THANKS FOR WEIGHING IN FROM\nVANCOUVER.",

THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS IT\nWILL NOT RELEASE THE REST OF HILLARY CLINTON'S DAILY MEETING\nSCHEDULES AHEAD OF ELECTION DAY. NOW, THIS NEWS AFTER AN EARLIER\nASSOCIATED PRESS REPORT ALLEGED THAT MORE THAN HALF OF THE\nPEOPLE THAT MRS. CLINTON MET WITH AS SECRETARY OF STATE WERE\nMAJOR DONORS TO HER FAMILY'S CHARITABLE FOUNDATION.\nDONALD TRUMP AND OTHER REPUBLICANS CALLING ON MRS.\nCLINTON TO JUMP IN AND END THAT RELAY BY RELEASING THE DOCUMENTS\nHERSELF. JOIN UKS NOW WITH REACTION IS\nJAMES WOOLSEY, FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE CIA.\nWELCOME, SIR. GOOD TO HAVE YOU ON THE PROGRAM\nTODAY. >> GOOD TO BE BACK WITH YOU.\n>> LET ME GET YOUR REACTION TO NEWS ABOUT THE DELAY, THE FACT\nTHAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS IT CANNOT POSSIBLY RELEASE THIS\nINFORMATION BEFORE ELECTION DAY. >> WHAT REALLY STRUCK ME IS THAT\nEVEN AFTER YOU EXCLUDE THE FOREIGN GOVERNMENT\nREPRESENTATIVES AND THE U.S. GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES WHO\nMET WITH THE SECRETARY AS THEY DO IN THE NUMBERS THEY SHOW, YOU\nSTILL, FROM OUTSIDERS, HAVE OVER HALF OF THEM WITH A RELATIONSHIP\nOF HAVING GIVEN MONEY TO STATE DEPARTMENT, THE INDIVIDUALS\nINVOLVED, FOUNDATION, WHATEVER. I FIND THAT REALLY VERY STRIKING\nNUMBER. AND IT WOULD SEEM TO ME A\nFAIRNESS WOULD SUGGEST THAT ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE MEETING\nWITH THE SECRETARY, AT LEAST OUGHT TO HAVE THEIR IDENTITY\nDISCLOSED UNLESS THERE'S SOME CLASSIFIED REASON TO KEEP IT\nSECRET. >> THE FACT THAT THE JUDGES\nINTERVENED AND ASKED FOR THE RELEASE OF THESE DOCUMENTS,\nCERTAINLY PUTS THE CAMPAIGN ON THE DEFENSIVE.\nIT'S BEEN A PARTICULARLY TOUGH WEEK FOR MRS. CLINTON WITH ALL\nTHE NEWS COMING AT ABOUT THIS AND A NUMBER OF NEWS\nORGANIZATIONS ASKING HER TO COME FORWARD WITH MORE INFORMATION\nAND ASKING TO CLOSE THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nWE ALSO LEARNED ABOUT WHAT THEY CALL A BLEACH BIT WHICH ACTUALLY\nERASES E-MAILS IN A WAY THAT YOU CAN'T GET TO THEM.\nCHAIRMAN -- TREY GOWDY POINTED THAT OUT THIS WEEK IN AN EARLIER\nINTERVIEW. IT'S LIKE AN ELECTRONIC\nSHREDDER. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT NEWS?\n>> THAT'S A VERY TOUGH BIT OF TECHNOLOGY.\nAND EFFECTIVE FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD.\nAND I SUPPOSE IF YOU'RE GOING TO SHRED SOMETHING YOU MAY AS WELL\nGO AHEAD AND SHRED IT THOROUGHLY.\nWE DIDN'T SHRED THINGS THOROUGHLY BEFORE OUR EMBASSY\nWAS TAKEN OVER BY THE IRANIANS IN '79 AND THEY PUT THE SHREDS\nBACK TOGETHER, SO TO FIND OUT WHAT HAD BEEN IN THE U.S.\nCOMMUNICATIONS. SO ONE HAS TO DO A JOB RIGHT, I\nSUPPOSE, BUT IT STRIKES ME AS A LOT OF ATTENTION TO THIS\nSITUATION AND WHEN YOU PUT IT TO THE WITH THE MEETING SCHEDULE\nFOR THE OUTSIDERS, THEY'RE SO THOROUGH AND SO LARGE, IT'S NOT\nGOOD FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE WAY ONE WOULD RUN THE STATE\nDEPARTMENT, I THINK. >> AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO SEE\nMORE FALLOUT, I AM SURE, AS WE EXPECT MORE E-MAILS TO BE RAE\nRELEASED IN THE DAYS AHEAD. I WANT TO SWITCH OVER NOW TO THE\nCONCERNS OVERSEAS ABOUT IRAN AND THE WAY IT IS TRYING TO PROVOKE\nTHE UNITED STATES WITH ITS OPERATIONS IN THE WATERS, IN THE\nPERSIAN GULF. TALK TO ME FOR A MOMENT ABOUT\nWHY DO YOU THINK THIS IS HAPPENING NOW?\nWHAT'S AT PLAY? AND WHAT DOES THIS REPRESENT\nKNOWING THAT IRAN IS DOING THIS DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT\nRECEIVED ALL THAT MONEY FROM THE DEAL, THE NUKE DEAL, AND IT\nPROMISED BETTER COOPERATION WITH THE UNITED STATES GOING FORWARD?\n>> IRANIAN PROMISES ON THINGS LIKE THAT ARE NOT ABOUT DOING\nDEALS, THEY'RE NOT ABOUT FAIRNESS, THEY'RE NOT ABOUT\nBALANCE, THEY'RE NOT ABOUT TRUTH.\nTHEY'RE ABOUT SHOWING DOMINANCE. AND WHAT IRAN IS INTERESTED IN\nIS BECOMING THE ACKNOWLEDGED SCHOOL YARD BULLY.\nTHAT WHEN THE BULLY WALKS UP AND SHOVES SOME OTHER STUDENT, THE\nOTHER STUDENT CRINGES. THAT'S WHAT IRAN WANTS.\nAND IT IS REALLY A VERY DECISION.\nTHEY'VE GONE FROM TWO INCIDENTS A MONTH NOW TO ABOUT ONE A WEEK\nHEADED TOWARD DOUBLE THAT. >> SO FAR IN 2016 THERE HAVE\nBEEN 250 INCIDENTS, COMPARED TO LAST YEAR, AT THE END OF LAST\nYEAR, THEY HAD OVER 300. SO IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE GOING\nTO HAVE EVEN MORE THIS YEAR, THESE PROVOCATIONS.\nNAVAL PROVOCATIONS. WHAT IS THE MESSAGE THEY'RE\nTRYING TO SEND HERE, THE DOMINANCE FACTOR, YOU SAY.\nBUT IT'S VERY DANGEROUS AND VERY RISKY BEHAVIOR.\n>> YES, IT IS. BUT THE IRANIANS AND THE\nREVOLUTIONARY GUARD COMMANDER WHO DID THIS IN 1983 IS THERE IN\nTHE PERSIAN GULF NOW. 1983 WHEN THEY BLEW UP OUR\nMARINE BARRACKS AND KILLED OVER 300 AMERICANS, VIRTUALLY THE\nENTIRE WORLD EXPECTED US TO RETALIATE IN SOME FASHION.\nWE DID NOT. WHEN WE SAID TO THE SYRIANS,\nTHERE'S A RED LINE, THE PRESIDENT SAID.\nDON'T CROSS IT. DON'T USE CHEMICAL WEAPONS\nAGAINST YOUR OWN PEOPLE. THE SYRIANS CROSSED IT AND THE\nUNITED STATES DID NOTHING. WE ARE BASICALLY CONVINCING IRAN\nAND MUCH OF THE REST OF THE WORLD THAT WE HAVE NO BACKBONE.\n>> AMBASSADOR JIM WOOLSEY, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY.\n>> THANK YOU.",

REACTION HAS COME OUT NOW THAT\nTHE STATE DEPARTMENT IS GOING TO BE WITHHOLDING THE OTHER HALF OF\nHER CALENDAR IN DECEMBER 30th.

ANYONE LOOKING AT THAT STORY\nBEYOND THAT FIRST PARAGRAPH KNOWS IT WAS COMPLETELY FALSE\nAND MISLEADING. WHEN YOU LOOK AT 153 PEOPLE, ANY\nSECRETARY OF STATE, HILLARY CLINTON OR OTHERWISE, IN TWO\nYEARS, YOU KNOW THEY'VE SEEN OVER A THOUSAND FOLKS.\nIT WAS A WRONG STORY. A.P. SHOULD BE SHAMED OF ITSELF.\n>> I'M GOING TO HAVE TO LET RON REACT TO THIS BECAUSE YOU USED\nTHE WORD FALSE. YOU USED THE WORD MISLEADING.\nBUT THE A.P. HAS IN THERE THAT 85 OUT OF 154 MEETINGS RESULTED\nIN SOME TYPE OF DONATION TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nYOU'RE SAYING THAT THAT'S NOT TRUE AND THEN I WANT TO GET\nRON'S REACTION. >> THE PROBLEM IS THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON AND MUSTAFA ARE SAYING THERE'S SMOKE AND NO FIRE.\nOUT OF THESE -- YOU'RE SEEING A LOT OF MEETING WHERE'S DONORS\nSHOWED UP AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT.\nIT HAPPENED. YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S NO SMOKE\nAND NO FIRE. JULIAN ASSANGE IS SAYING, HEY,\nMAYBE I DO HAVE THE FIRE AND WE HAVE MORE STUFF TO RELEASE.\nSO MAYBE THE FIRE DOES EXIST AND IT'S GOING TO BE A PROBLEM FOR\nHILLARY CLINTON AND IT'S CREATING A BIGGER PROBLEM\nBECAUSE OF THE FALLOUT FROM IT. ESPECIALLY WITH THE KEY PART OF\nTHE DEMOCRAT BASE. MILLENNIALS.\nRIGHT NOW SHE'S AROUND 40%. PRESIDENT OBAMA GOT 50%.\nGETTING TO THE DATA. IT'S BECAUSE THEY THINK SHE'S\nDISHONEST. THIS BACKS UP THAT POINT, THAT\nPEOPLE THINK SHE'S DISHONEST. SHE DID THINGS IN THE STATE\nDEPARTMENT FOR HER OWN PERSONAL GAIN.\nNAME ME SOMEBODY IN CONGRESS WHO HAS A PERSONAL CHARITY THAT\nPEOPLE DONATE TO. YOU DONATE TO CAMPAIGNS BUT A\nPERSONAL PRIVATE CHARITY IS DIFFERENT.\nIT BACKS UP THIS VIEW THAT SHE'S CORRUPT, THAT SHE'S DISHONEST.\nTHAT'S WHY SHE'S NOT RUNNING AWAY WITH THIS ELECTION.\nTHAT'S WHY IT'S STILL VERY CLOSE AND DONALD TRUMP HAS A CHANCE.\n>> MUSTAFA, I WANT YOU TO RESPOND TO THAT.\n>> LOOK. ONE, SHE'S A DOUBLE DIGIT LEAD.\nVERY FAR AWAY FROM DONALD TRUMP. LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE THAT THEY\nPOINTED OUT. THEY SAID THERE WAS A MEETING\nWITH MOHAMMED EUNICE WHO IS A NOBEL PEACE PRIZE WINNER WHO\nFOUNDED MICROLENDING ACROSS THE WORLD AND THEY SAID THERE WAS A\nMEETING WITH THE BANKER AND A DONOR.\nTHIS IS RIDICULOUS. AND ONCE YOU READ BEYOND THAT,\nTHE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF A.P., YOU REALIZE IT.\nAND I THINK THAT, AGAIN, I THINK A.P. SHOULD BE ASHAME AND I KNOW\nTHEY'RE ROLLING BACK THEIR STORY QUITE A BIT FROM WHERE THEY\nSTARTED. HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN WORKING\nON THIS HER ENTIRE CAREER AND THE CHAIR CITY IS NOT TAKING ANY\nMONEY FROM IT, PERSONAL MONEY FROM THE CHARITY.\nDOING GOOD AROUND THE WORLD. TO DENIGRATE THE WORK THEY'VE\nBEEN SAVING LIVES, LIFTING PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY.\nIMPORTANT THINGS THAT HAVE TO BE DONE.\n>> OKAY. >> SO YOU'RE SAYING THE FACT\nTHAT HILLARY CLINTON, YOU KNOW, UNDER HER STATE DEPARTMENT RULE\nBILL CLINTON GOT $5 MILLION FROM A FOR-PROFIT COLLEGE.\nYOU'RE SAYING THAT MONEY WAS FREE AND CLEAR?\nNOW SHE'S SAYING -- >> FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE\nUNITED STATES. HE WAS THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF\nTHE UNITED STATES WHO STARTED THIS CHARITY M.\nYOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE HILLARY CLINTON WAS, YOU KNOW, THIS IS A\nPAY TO PLAY TYPE OF SCENARIO. THIS IS MANUFACTURED OUTRAGE.\n>> THOSE ARE THE ACCUSATIONS. AT THE SAME TIME, WE'RE LEARNING\nTHE STATE DEPARTMENT IS WITHHOLDING THE OTHER HALF OF\nHER CALENDAR WHEN THIS IS ALL SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT\nTRANSPARENCY. IF SHE WANTS TO EARN THE TRUST\nOF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THEN WHY ISN'T SHE OKAY WITH THE CALENDAR\nBEING RELEASED? >> THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAS TO\nGO THROUGH THE PROCESS. THEY HAVE TO MAKE SURE THERE'S\nNOT CLASSIFIED INFORMATION IN THOSE CALENDARS.\nTHOSE MEETINGS AFFECT PEOPLE THAT ARE REPRESENTING OUR\nGOVERNMENT AROUND THE WORLD AND WE WANT TO --\n>> NOW THEY -- >> LAST WORD.\n>> NOW THEY CARE ABOUT CLASSIFIED INFORMATION, HILLARY\nCLINTON. NOW THEY DO, RIGHT?\nNOTHING MATTERED WHEN SHE HAD HER OWN PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER.\nNOW THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE. HOLD ON.\n>> AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. >> RON, YOU CAN HAVE THE LAST\nWORD AND WRAP IT UP. >> THANK YOU.\nTHIS IS WHY JASON IS SAYING WHEN HE IS GETTING DOCUMENTS FROM THE\nSTATE DEPARTMENT MOST OF THE STUFF HAS BEEN REDACTED.\nSTUFF FROM THE PHISH HAS BEEN REDACTED.\nMUSTAFA, YOU MIGHT BE ONE OF THE ONE IN THREE AMERICANS WHO THINK\nSHE'S HONEST. 33%.\nTHAT'S NOT VERY MUCH. AND HERE'S THE THING, IS THAT,\nYOU KNOW WHAT, DONALD TRUMP IS STAYING CLOSER IN THE RACE AND\nBECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE. IT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T THINK\nSHE'S HONEST. IT'S A SAD STATE FOR AMERICAN\nPOLITICS WHEN IT'S A RACE TO SEE WHO IS DISLIKED OR DISTRUSTED\nTHE MOST.

CLINTON INSISTS THERE WAS NO\nPAY-TO-PLAY GOING ON HERE. HERE'S THE STATE DEPARTMENT ON\nTHE ISSUE EARLIER THIS WEEK. >> AS WE SAID BEFORE, THE STATE\nDEPARTMENT MEETS WITH A RANGE OF PEOPLE AND A WIDE RANGE OF\nPEOPLE OUTSIDE INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS CONTACT THE STATE\nDEPARTMENT NEEDING REQUESTS, RECOMMENDATIONS, PROPOSALS COME\nTO THE DEPARTMENT THROUGH A RANGE OF CHANNELS.\n>> THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN SAYS THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS\nSHIELDING CLINTON FROM ACCOUNTABILITY.\nA SPOKESMAN SAID, \"IT IS UNACCEPTABLE THAT THE STATE\nDEPARTMENT IS NOW REFUSING TO RELEASE HER OFFICIAL SCHEDULE\nBEFORE THE ELECTION IN FULL. VOTERS DESERVE TO KNOW THE TRUTH\nBEFORE THEY CAST THEIR BALLOTS. THE A.P. SAYS ITS LAWYERS ASKED\nSTATE LAST NIGHT TO MOVE FASTER ON THIS AND PROVIDE ALL OF\nCLINTON'S MINUTE BY MINUTE SCHEDULES BY OCTOBER 15th.\n>> MOLLY HENNEBERG, THANK YOU SO MUCH.\nHERE TO TALK ABOUT ALL THIS, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" POLITICAL\nREPORTER PETER NICHOLAS. THE STATE DEPARTMENT HALTING ITS\nRELEASE OF CLINTON'S SCHEDULE ON THE HEELS OF AN A.P. REPORT\nWHICH SHOWS ABOUT HALF OF THE FOLKS SHE MET WITH IN SOME WAY\nOR ANOTHER ENDED UP DONATING TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nWHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT THAT VOTERS SEE HER ENTIRE SCHEDULE?\n>> THE QUESTION IS WHO DID HILLARY CLINTON MEET WITH WHEN\nSHE WAS AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT? DID SHE MEET WITH CLINTON\nFOUNDATION DONORS? THE A.P. REPORT SHOW THERE WERE\nDOZENS AND DOZENS OF DONORS TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION WHO GOT\nACCESS TO HER. IS THIS A PAY-TO-PLAY ATMOSPHERE\nTHAT WAS PREVALENT AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT WHILE SHE WAS THERE?\nBECAUSE OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE WE'LL HAVE THE\nFULL PICTURE OF EXACTLY WHO SHE MET WITH UNTIL AFTER THE\nELECTION. THE NOTION IS THIS IS SOME\nIMPORTANT FOUNDATION FOR VOTERS TO EVALUATE BEFORE NOVEMBER 8th.\n>> WE HEARD THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN SAY THIS IS THE EXAMPLE OF THE\nOBAMA ADMINISTRATION SHIELDING HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHEN YOU HAVE THE STATE DEPARTMENT.\nTHEY SPOKE WITH REPORTERS THIS WEEK AND THEY SAID, LISTEN, THE\nSTATE DEPARTMENT MEETS WITH A RANGE OF PEOPLE IN A RANGE OF\nCHANNELS. WHAT CAN WE GLEAN FROM THESE\nMEETINGS THUS FAR? AT THE SAME TIME, WHY IS IT\nIMPORTANT WE SEE THE ADDITIONAL SCHEDULE DETAILS?\n>> WELL, WE REPORTED, FOR EXAMPLE, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\"\nTHAT, A FOR-PROFIT NETWORK OF COLLEGES CALLED LAUREATE TOOK\nPART IN A MEETING AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT HOSTED BY HILLARY\nCLINTON WITH YALE UNIVERSITY AND CORNELL, OTHER NONPROFIT\nSCHOOLS. LAUREATE WAS A DONOR TO THE\nSTATE DEPARTMENT, EMPLOYED BILL CLINTON AND PAID THEM MILLIONS\nOF DOLLARS. AN OFFICIAL WAS AT THESE\nMEETINGS. SO THERE'S SOME CONCERNS ABOUT\nWHY THEY WOULD GET THAT ACCESS. DID THEY GET ANY SPECIAL ACCESS\nOR TREATMENT THAT AN ORDINARY PERSON WHO WANTS TO BE WITH\nHILLARY CLINTON CANNOT GET? THAT'S THE QUESTION HERE.\nIT'S LIABILITY FOR HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN SHE IS HAVING\nTO COPE WITH. THE FACT THAT ALL THESE RECORDS\nWON'T BE OUT UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION IS NOT NECESSARILY GOOD\nFOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WHICH IS HOPING TO EXPLOIT THIS ISSUE AND\nGAIN TRACTION. >> YOU TALKED ABOUT LAUREATE.\nAT ONE POINT BILL CLINTON WAS EARNING UPWARDS OF $16 MILLION.\nSINCE THAT, THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WE HEARD THAT NOW\nCHELSEA IS REALLY AT THE HELM OF THE CLINTON GLOBAL INITIATIVE.\nDOES THAT STILL MEAN THERE ARE FAMILY TIES?\nDOES THAT HELP OR HURT THE CLINTON FAMILY?\n>> THERE IS A THOUGHT AMONG PEOPLE CLOSE TO THE CLINTONS\nSAID THIS IS AN UNTENABLE SITUATION.\nRIGHT NOW THE FOUNDATION IS SAYING CHELSEA MAY WELL BE\nINVOLVED IF HILLARY CLINTON IS ELECTED PRESIDENT.\nBILL CLINTON SAID HE WILL STEP DOWN FROM THE BOARD.\nHE WON'T RAISE MONEY FROM THE BOARD.\nTHE QUESTION IS, DOES THAT GO FAR ENOUGH OR WILL THE CONFLICTS\nOF INTEREST ALLEGATIONS FOLLOW HILLARY CLINTON INTO THE WHITE\nHOUSE IF SHE WINS? S THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO SAY\nTHE CLINTONS NEED TO CUT THEIR TIES TO THE FOUNDATION ENTIRELY,\nSHUT IT DOWN OR TURN IT OVER TO AN INDEPENDENT GROUP LIKE THE\nGATES FOUNDATION. OTHERWISE THERE'S GOING TO BE\nTREMENDOUS SCRUTINY OF THE FOUNDATION, FOUNDATION DONORS\nAND OVERLAPPING INTEREST WITH THE CLINTON WHITE HOUSE SHOULD\nSHE WIN THAT WOULD DOG HER TO THE FIRST TERM.\nI WANT TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND GET YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THE\nWHERE DO YOU SEE THIS GOING FROM HERE?\n>> I DON'T THINK THESE ALLEGATIONS ARE GOING TO DIE\nOUT. THERE WILL BE A STEADY DRUM BEAT\nOF E-MAILS BEING RELEASED THAT ARE SOME OF WHICH WERE RECOVERED\nBY THE FBI DURING THEIR INVESTIGATION.\nTHESE HAVE BEEN TURNED OVER TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND WILL BE\nRELEASED TO JUDICIAL WATCH AND ADVOCACY GROUPS AND ULTIMATELY\nREVIEWED BY THE PRESS. THIS IS GOING TO BE HAPPENING ON\nA ROLLING BASIS FOR MANY MONTHS. WE'LL LEARN MORE ABOUT WHAT\nHILLARY CLINTON DID WHEN SHE WAS IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT.\nWHEN THEY SHOW THERE ARE MORE DONORS WITH THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION THAT MET WITH HILLARY CLINTON, THAT WILL BE REPORTED\nON AND THAT WILL BE SOMETHING HILLARY CLINTON WILL HAVE TO\nANSWER FOR IF SHE IS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nWHAT IT'S LOOKING LIKE IS THESE CONTROVERSIES ARE GOING TO BE\nFOLLOWING HER INTO THE WHITE HOUSE IF SHE WINS.\nSOMETHING SHE IS NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO NOT PUT BEHIND HER,\nPERHAPS LESS SHORT OF A DRAMATIC BREAK FOR THE CLINTON FOUNDATION\nWHICH THEY ARE UNWILLING TO MAKE.\n>> VERY INTERESTING. PETER NICHOLS, THANK YOU FOR\nJOINING US. WE HOPE TO HAVE YOU BACK AS THE\nSTORY CONTINUES TO DEVELOP.",

I'M TELLING YOU FOR THEM TO\nOBSESS ABOUT THAT INSTEAD OF INVESTIGATING THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION, THE CLINTON FOUNDATION WAS ALWAYS AS IS\nOBVIOUS NOW, RIGHT FOR INVESTIGATION.\nIT IS A -- THIS -- I MEAN I'VE BEEN TO SOME OF THOSE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION SEMINARS AT THE HOTELS NEAR OUR FOX NEWS WORLD\nHEADQUARTERS. THE LAVISHNESS OF THE SPENDING.\nTHE WHOLE VIBE THAT YOU GET THERE IS NOT ONE OF DOING GOOD,\nBUT RATHER, IT'S LOOK AT US. I THOUGHT THAT REALLY IT WAS THE\nKIND OF THING WHERE THE INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT COULD BE\nFOUND AND I THINK THEY HAVE FOUND IT IN THE -- I WON'T SAY\nQUID PRO QUOS BUT THE ASSOCIATED PRESS DID A MAGNIFICENT JOB IN\nGETTING AHOLD OF HER PUBLIC CALENDAR AND SHOWING ABOUT 50%\nOR MORE OF HER MEETINGS WERE HELD WITH PEOPLE WHO EITHER\nINDIVIDUALLY OR AS CORPORATION OR AS NATIONAL AGENCIES -- GAVE\nMONEY TO THE FOUNDATION. >> [ INAUDIBLE ] THE RIGHT\nHILLARY CLINTON SCANDAL. THAT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT YOU'RE\nSAYING. LET'S HEAR FROM SOMEBODY WHO WAS\nINSIDE OF THE FOUNDATION RIGHT HERE.\n>> I FEEL FAIRLY CONFIDENT IT IS NOT IN THE TOP TIER -- IF YOU\nTALK TO DEVELOPMENT PROFESSIONALS IT IS NOT IN THE\nTOP TIER. I HAVE SEEN THEIR WORK IN HAITI\nUP CLOSE IN PERSON. THERE'S SOME VERY GOOD PEOPLE\nWHO WORK THERE. BUT THEY ARE -- HAITI IS ONE OF\nTHEIR SINGULAR FOCUSES, A SMALL COUNTRY.\nTHEY HAVE NOT HAD A MAJOR IMPACT ON HAITI.\nMORE THE PERFORMANCE OF VERY PUBLIC CHARITY NOT THE ACTUAL\nINTERVENTION. >> BUT IT'S NOT GOOD.\n>> ADAM DAVIDSON CONTRIBUTING TO THE NEW YORKER, ATTENDED THE\nFUNCTIONS YOU TALKED ABOUT. NOT EVEN IS THE MONEY USED TO\nPAY TO PLAY BUT NOT EFFECTIVE WHERE IT'S BEING APPLIED.\n>> WE DON'T KNOW IF IT'S USED QUID PRO QUO, PAY TO PLAY YET,\nTHAT HASN'T BEEN ESTABLISHED, BUT THE APPEARANCE IS THERE THAT\nYOU GIVE MONEY YOU CAN HAVE A MEETING WITH THE SECRETARY OF\nSTATE. I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH\nEVERYTHING HE SAID. I MEAN, TO ME IT DID NOT SEEM --\nI'VE SEEN CHARITIES WORKING GRITTY.\nI WAS ACTUALLY WITH SECRETARY CLINTON IN HAITI AFTER THE\nEARTHQUAKE THERE AND I SAID TO HER, YOU KNOW, THIS IS A COUNTRY\nWHERE THE GOVERNMENT YAP PER RAT TUS IS RIPE WITH CORRUPTION HOW\nARE YOU GOING TO STRAIGHTEN THIS OUT, THROW GOOD MONEY AFTER BAD,\nNO, WE HAVE SAFE GLGUARDS IN PLACE AND ALL THE REST OF IT.\nSHE WAS TRYING TO DUCK ME WHEN GRABBING HER FOR THAT INTERVIEW\nON THE TARMAC AND I THINK THE CLINTON FOUNDATION IS A VERY,\nVERY VULNERABLE AREA FOR THE CLINTONS.\nTO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER THEY ARE INTENTIONALLY DRAGGING\nTHEIR FEET. IN THEIR DEFENSE, THERE ARE\nTHOUSANDS OF FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUESTS FOR THIS\nDATA, HER CALENDAR AND SO FORTH. THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS DOING\nDEMOCRACY, CERTAINLY NOT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, ANY FAVORS IN\nTHE PACE, THIS GA LAY SHALL PACE, REDACTING NAMES, CHECKING\nFOR SECRETS IN THE -- OF, YOU KNOW, THE SCHEDULING AND SO\nFORTH. SO I THINK THAT THEY WILL\nSUCCEED IN DELAYING THE RELEASE OF FURTHER CALENDAR DATA UNTIL\nPAST THE ELECTION. >> TO TIM KAINE FOR A SECOND.\nTHE INTERNET IS IN AN UPROAR ABOUT THIS.\nTIM KAINE ACTING AS THE ATTACK DOG, GOING AFTER DONALD TRUMP\nFOR THESE UNSOLICITED ENDORSEMENTS FROM THE KKK.\n>> WHO DO YOU LIKE FOR PRESIDENT, SIR?\n>> HILLARY CLINTON. >> DO YOU THINK WHITES ARE\nSUPERIOR TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND LATINOS.\n>> WELL, WE ARE GOD'S CHOSEN PEOPLE.\n>> OH. >> REALLY CONFUSED.\nTIM KAINE YESTERDAY ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL TALKING ABOUT\nTRUMP VALUES EQUAL KKK VALUES BECAUSE DAVID DUKE HAS THROWN\nHIS SUPPORTER BEHIND DONALD TRUMP.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.\nHE HAS NOT COME OUT AND SAID THANK YOU, I REALLY APPRECIATE\nIT. WE'RE HEARING FROM THE GRAND\nMARSHAL, GRAND DRAGON OF THE KKK HAS ENDORSED HILLARY CLINTON.\nWHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT? TROUBLE FOR THE CLINTON CAMP?\n>> HOLD ON. LET ME SAY IN BOLD LETTERS, I'VE\nKNOWN DONALD TRUMP GOING INTO FOUR DECADES, HE DOESN'T HAVE A\nRACIST BONE IN HIS BODY. I KNOW THAT FOR A FACT.\nON \"CELEBRITY APPRENTICE\" FOUR OF THE 12 CANDIDATES WERE\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN AND SEVERAL LATINOS AND LATINAS.\nI THINK THAT TRUMP SEES ONE COLOR AND THAT COLOR IS GREEN.\nYOU KNOW, AS A BUSINESSMAN. NOW HE SEES ONE COLOR AND THE\nCOLOR IS VOTER. I THINK THAT HE HELPED FUEL THIS\nNOTION BY BEING VERY CYNICAL IN HIS -- AND I LOVE THE GUY --\nBEING VERY CYNICAL HE CAMPAIGNED GOING UP TO THE SOUTH\nCAROLINA PRIMARY. I WAS THERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA.\nHE DID NOT DENOUNCE DAVID DUKE QUICKLY ENOUGH.\nEVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DAVID DUKE IS.\n>> H.W. BUSH CALLED HIM A BIG GOTH.\n>> WHAT SHOULD HILLARY CLINTON DO WITH THIS ENDORSEMENT?\n>> DAVID DUKE. HE SHOULD HAVE DENOUNCED HIM.\nBLACK GUYS GETTING BEAT UP AT THE RALLIES.\nIS HILLARY CLINTON GOING TO GET ASKED ABOUT THIS ENDORSEMENT?\n>> NO. OF COURSE SHE IS NOT.\nYOU CAN LAMENT THE UNFAIRNESS OF THAT ALL DAY LONG BUT THE BOTTOM\nLINE IS YOU STARTED THIS SEGMENT WITH THE PIECE ON DWYANE WADE'S\nCOUSIN BEING KILLED AS SHE PUSHED HER TODDLER FOR SCHOOL\nREGISTRATION IN CHICAGO. THE MOTHER OF FOUR.\nSDWAIN DWYANE, THE NBA GREAT AND HIS MOM HAD JUST APPEARED ON A\nSHOW VIA SATELLITE HOOKUP THURSDAY NIGHT IN CHICAGO ABOUT\nGUN VIOLENCE. AND HERE HIS COUSIN IS KILLED.\nTHE VERY NEXT DAY. IT IS APPALLING.\nTHAT IS THE CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE OF OUR TIME.\nDONALD TRUMP IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT TO SPEAK ABOUT IT.\nMY COMPLAINT IS, HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR THE LAST\nYEAR AND THIS ELECTION WILL COME DOWN -- WILL COME DOWN TO\nDEMOGRAPHICS AND DOWN TO RACE AND RIGHT NOW, HE HAS ONE\nDEMOGRAPHIC, 20 SECONDS, I WAS -- I TOOK MY VOTE TO A JIMMY\nBUFFET CONCERT ANCHORED OFF THERE, 30 OTHER BOATS THERE, ALL\nFLYING TRUMP FLAGS. ALL FLYING TRUMP FLAGS.\nTHAT'S ONE DEMO HE HAS FOR SURE. THE MIDDLE-AGED WHITE GUY VOTER.\n>> I DON'T THINK WE KNOW THAT MUCH.\n>> ALL RIGHT. >> THANK YOU.\n>> INFORMAL POLL RIGHT THERE. >> THAT'S MY POLL.\n>> THEY WERE PLAYING MARGARITAVILLE.\n>> THEY WERE PLAYING MARGARITAVILLE.\n>> HAVE YOU HEARD OF TRUMP OCRATES.\nWHY THE SWITCH?

IT'S THE FIRST FLASH FLOOD\nEMERGENCY EVER IN THE AREA. UP TO SIX INCHES OF RAIN\nFALLING IN JUST TWO HOURS IN PARTS OF THE CITY.\nSTRANDING CARS. THERE WERE ALSO AT LEAST 10\nWATER RESCUES IN JUST ONE COUNTY.\nAND A ROLLER COASTER NEARLY TOPPLING OVER AS SIX\nTERRIFIED CHILDREN ARE STILL TRAPPED INSIDE MORE THAN A\nDOZEN FAIR GOERS RUSHED TO THE SCENE TO HOLD UP THE\nRIDE. A TRACK MALFUNCTION IS BEING\nBLAMED FOR THE RIDE NEARLY FALLING OVER AT THE BARTOE\nCOUNTY FAIR IN GEORGIA. THE RIDE HAS BEEN TORN DOWN\nAND THREE OTHERS HAVE BEEN CLOSED FOR REPAIRS.\nTHANKFULLY, NO ONE WAS HURT. THOSE ARE YOUR HEADLINES\nTHIS SATURDAY MORNING. >> THANK YOU, SANDRA.\nHILLARY CLINTON LUCKING OUT AGAIN THANKS TO THE STATE\nDEPARTMENT. IT'S JUST ANNOUNCING THAT IT\nWON'T COMPLETE THE COURT ORDERED RELEASE OF HER\nPERSONAL CALENDAR SCHEDULE UNTIL AFTER ELECTION DAY,\nDECEMBER 30TH. >> INTERESTING.\nA LITTLE LATE. GARRETT TENNEY HAS ALL THE\nDETAILS FROM WASHINGTON, D.C.\nGOOD MORNING, GARRETT. >> PETE, CLAYTON, AND\nSANDRA, GOOD MORNING. THE TIMING OF THIS COULD NOT\nBE BETTER FOR THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN.\nIT WAS JUST THIS WEEK WHEN WE LEARNED THAT THE A.P.\nANNUALIZED THE FIRST HALF OF HILLARY CLINTON'S\nMINUTE-BY-MINUTE SCHEDULE OF HER TERM AS SECRETARY OF\nSTATE HAS BEEN RELEASED. MORE THAN HALF OF THE PEOPLE\nSHE SPOKE WITH OUTSIDE OF THE GOVERNMENT WERE GIVEN\nMONEY TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION FOR A TOTAL OF\n$156 MILLION. THAT BROUGHT A WHOLE NEW\nROUND OF CRITICISM FOR THE CLINTON FOUNDATION AND THE\nAPPEARANCE OF A PAY-TO-PLAY CULTURE WITHIN THE CLINTON\nSTATE DEPARTMENT. CLINTON HAS ARGUED THE\nA.P.'S ANALYSIS IS FLAWED AND THAT SHE MET WITH PEOPLE\nREGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY DONATED MONEY TO HER\nFAMILY'S CHARITY. BUT, AS THINGS CURRENTLY\nSTAND, WE WON'T KNOW UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION IF THE\nSECOND HALF OF HER DAILY MINUTE-BY-MINUTE SCHEDULE\nEITHER SUPPORTS THAT IDEA OR GOES ALONG WITH A LOT OF\nTHESE CRITICISMS. WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN.\nNOW, THIS WHOLE SAGA OVER HER SCHEDULES BEGAN BACK IN\n2010 AND 2013 WHEN THE A.P. ASKED STATE TO RELEASE THEM.\nTHAT DIDN'T HAPPEN UNTIL THE A.P. FILED A LAWSUIT WITH\nTHE STATE DEPARTMENT IN FEDERAL COURT.\nWHEN THAT HAPPENED, THE JUDGE ORDERED THEM TO START\nRELEASING THE EMAILS OR THE SCHEDULES RATHER IN BATCHES\nSHOWING WHO SHE MET WITH AND SPOKE TO DURING HER TENURE.\nYESTERDAY, THE STATE DEPARTMENT ATTORNEYS TOLD\nTHE ASSOCIATED PRESS THOUGH, THERE WERE ABOUT 2700 PAGES\nLEFT, MEANING UNDER THE CURRENT SCHEDULE, WE CAN\nEXPECT TO SEE THOSE AROUND DECEMBER 30TH, AFTER THE\nELECTION HAS BEEN WRAPPED UP.\nNOW, THE A.P. HAS FORMALLY REQUESTED THAT THAT PROCESS\nBE SPED UP SO THAT VOTERS HAVE THE INFORMATION PRIOR\nTO THE ELECTION. PREVIOUSLY JUDGE RICHARD\nLEON HAS EXPRESSED HIS OWN FRUSTRATION OVER THE STATE\nDEPARTMENT SEEMINGLY TO TRY TO RUN OUT THE CLOCK ON\nRELEASING DOCUMENTS RELATED TO HILLARY CLINTON.\nAT THIS POINT IT IS UNCLEAR IF HE WILL STEP IN WITH A\nCOURT ORDER REQUESTING THE STATE DEPARTMENT OR FORCING\nTHEM, RATHER TO SPEED UP THIS PROCESS AND GET THEM\nOUT BEFORE THE ELECTION. >> CONVENIENT.\nGARRETT, GREAT TO SEE YOU THIS MORNING, THANK YOU SO\nMUCH. >> THANK YOU, GARRETT.\n>> WE WANT TO WRING IN NATIONAL SECURITY STAFF\nUNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA AND GEORGE W. BUSH JULIAN\nTURNER. FIRST, REACTION TO WHAT WE\nARE HEARING FROM GARRETT HERE NOT RELEASING THESE\nPOTENTIAL CALENDARS UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR AFTER\nTHE ELECTION. NORMAL PROTOCOL?\n>> I DON'T KNOW. BUT IT'S UNFORTUNATE FOR THE\nAMERICAN VOTERS. YOU WANT TO HAVE CANDIDATES\nRUNNING FOR PRESIDENT THAT ARE TRANSPARENT AND YOU KNOW\nWHAT YOU ARE GETTING WHEN YOU SIGN UP HERE.\nYOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO KIND BUY AND QUESTION THE\nPURCHASE LATER IF YOU ARE VOTING FOR SECRETARY\nCLINTON. >> SHOULD HILLARY CLINTON\nCALL FOR CALENDARS TO BE RELEASED.\n>> THAT'S AN INTERESTING IDEA.\nIT WOULD PROBABLY BEHOOVE HER FROM OPTICS PERSPECTIVE\nIF NOTHING ELSE. IF THERE IS NOTHING TO HIDE,\nLET'S SHOW FOLKS WHAT THERE IS AND BE HONEST AND OPEN I\nWOULD. >> OVERNIGHT SECRETARY OF\nSTATE JOHN KERRY CLAIMING THE U.S. HAS ACHIEVED\nCLARITY WITH RUSSIA. ON OUR ROLES IN THE MIDDLE\nEAST. SO, WE ARE ASKING YOU WHY\nDOES THIS SO VERY UNCLEAR. >> PARTICULARLY, INTERESTING\nCHOICE. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, FROM\nLOTS OF FOLKS IN THE FOREIGN POLICY COMMUNITY'S\nPERSPECTIVE, BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF ANTITHESIS.\nNOBLE EFFORT TO TRY TO BRING A SEMBLANCE OF ORDER AND\nPEACE TO THE SIR I DON'T KNOW PEOPLE AFTER FIVE YEARS\nOF THIS HORRENDOUS CIVIL WAR.\nSO, WHAT'S HAPPENING THOUGH IS THAT THE UNITED STATES\nAND RUSSIA ARE LOOKING TO SET UP THE SECURITY\nFRAMEWORK. THEY WANT TO SET UP A JOINT\nCOMMAND CENTER IN JORDAN WITH SOME SHARED\nINTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS TO TRY AND COORDINATE THE\nEFFORTS IN SYRIA. THE BIG PROBLEM AS EVERYBODY\nKNOWS IS THEY CAN'T AGREE ON WHAT THE SECURITY TARGETS\nARE THAT'S THE FIRST PROBLEM.\nTHE SECOND PROBLEM IS THAT THE RUSSIANS ARE NOT TO BE\nTRUSTED AS FAR AS YOU CAN THROW A STICK IN THIS\nCOUNTRY. >> BOMBING AND SUPPORTING\nDIFFERENT TARGETS. >> EXACTLY.\n>> VLADIMIR PUTIN IS TRYING TO SUSPECT PLANT AMERICA AS\nTHE CHIEF ACTOR IN THE MIDDLE EAST.\n>> OF COURSE. THERE IS A LOT OF THAT GOING\nON. THERE IS A STRUGGLE FOR,\nHERE, A KIND OF, I GUESS, A POST ASSAD SYRIA IN THE\nFUTURE. POST ASSAD SYRIA IN THE\nFUTURE AND WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.\nWHO IS GOING TO HAVE A HAND IN SHAPING THAT NEW NATION?\nAND RUSSIA, OBVIOUSLY, WANTS TO BE THE GUY ON THE GROUND.\n>> ONE OF OUR BIG QUESTIONS IS THE STRATEGY.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN HITTING THE OBAMA\nADMINISTRATION ON STRATEGY IN THAT REGION FOR A LONG\nTIME. WHAT IS THE STRATEGY?\nWHAT IS THE PLAN FOR STABILITY IN THAT REGION?\nDO WE KNOW WHAT IT IS? >> WELL, CERTAINLY, WITH\nTHIS ADMINISTRATION, WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO IS\nCOME TO WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO CALL A POLITICAL\nDIPLOMATIC SOLUTION. SO, YOU KNOW, RATHER THAN\nSEND IN TANKS AND GUYS WITH GUNS, THIS ARE GOING TO TRY\nTO NEGOTIATE ALL OF THIS. >> SO ISIS IS COOL.\n>> KIND OF THE FIRST STAGE IN THAT PROCESS.\nTHAT'S WHAT THEY'RE HOPING TO DO.\n>> JULIAN, WE HAD A CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY\nMORNING BUT THIS WEEK WE SAW THAT THE IRANIAN\nCONFRONTATION WITH THE U.S. DESTROYER AND NOW THIS, THAT\nIRAN CONFRONTATIONS WITH U.S. NAVY SHIPS ARE UP 50%\nTHIS YEAR ALONE. WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT OUR\nRELATIONS WITH IRAN RIGHT NOW AND THE WAY THAT IRAN\nVIEWS AMERICA? >> IT'S NOT THE FIRST\nPROVOCATION BY THE IRANIANS IN THE PERSIAN GULF THIS\nYEAR. WE ARE GOING TO PROBABLY SEE\nMORE. IN MY OPINION IT'S BECAUSE\nTHERE IS NO INCENTIVES. WE PROVIDE THEM TO NOT\nBEHAVE IN THAT WAY. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, IT GOES\nBACK TO THE NUCLEAR DEAL AND THE FACT THAT THERE WERE NO\nPRECONDITIONS. WE TOOK THE NUCLEAR ISSUE\nAND DECIDED TO NEGOTIATE WITH THEM ON IT.\nOUT OF THE FRAMEWORK OF EVERYTHING ELSE.\nWE ALLOWED THEM TO CONTINUE THEIR EGREGIOUS HUMAN RIGHTS\nVIOLATIONS, ATROCITIES AGAINST THEIR OWN PEOPLE.\nWE ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE SPONSORING TERRORISM AROUND\nTHE REGION. AND FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE,\nTHERE IS NO REASON TO CURTAIL ANY OF THAT\nBEHAVIOR. >> AXIS BETWEEN IRAN AND\nVLADIMIR PUTIN IN RUSSIA, RIGHT?\nI MEAN. >> NEW AXIS OF EVIL.\n>> ALWAYS GREAT TO SEE YOU. >> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.\n>> NEW AXIS OF EVIL, THANK YOU, JULIAN.\n>> JANICE DEAN OUTSIDE WITH A LOOK AT THE FORECAST.\nSHE IS OUT IN THE CRACKER BARREL COUNTRY STORE ON OUR\nPLAZA. >> OH MY GOSH.\nTHIS IS THE DOUBLE CHOCOLATE FUDGE COCA COLA CAKE.\nEN. >> I'M GOING TO HOLD.\nTHIS TELL ME ABOUT THIS WONDERFUL CAKE THAT YOU MAKE\nAT CRACKER BARREL WHILE I EAT IT.\n>> THIS IS ONE OF OUR BELOVED MENU ITEMS.\nDOUBLE CHOCOLATE FUDGE COCA COLA CAKE.\nREALLY SWIFT BOAT, DELICIOUS, SERVED WITH ICE\nCHROME. ONE OF THE REASONS WE\nBROUGHT IT TODAY WAS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE SERVE ON\nVETERANS DAY FREE TO ALL ACTIVE VETERANS TO THANK\nTHEM FOR SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY.\n>> THANK YOU FOR THIS CAKE. I LOVE IT.\nWEATHER WHILE I EAT THIS CAKE.\nDISTURBANCE ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA.\nHOLD THAT FOR ME. WE ARE WATCHING THIS AREA OF\nLOW PRESSURE THAT ACTUALLY COULD MOVE INTO THE GULF OF\nMEXICO. WE ARE WATCHING THAT VERY\nCAREFULLY. TORNADO THREAT THROUGH\nTONIGHT. I'M DOING THE WEATHER WHILE\nI HAVE CHOCOLATE CAKE. IT'S NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE\nBUT IT'S DELICIOUS. AREA OF LOW PRESSURE ACROSS\nTHE BAHAMAS. WATCHING IT VERY CAREFULLY.\nIT'S NOT A DEPRESSION. IT'S NOT EVEN A STORM YET.\nBUT, AS IT MOVES INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO, IT DOES\nPOTENTIALLY HAVE CHARACTERISTICS TO DEVELOP,\nBUT FOR NOW IT LOOKS GOOD. THERE ARE YOUR HIGHS TODAY.\nOKAY.

THE QUESTION FOR VOTERS IS\nWHETHER THEY ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THE ETHICS OF ALL OF THAT.\nAND THEN BEYOND THAT, WHETHER THAT ISSUE IS BIGGER THAN ALL\nTHE OTHER ISSUES IN THE CAMPAIGN.\nRIGHT NOW, HILLARY CLINTON SEEMS TO BE DOING PRETTY WELL AS THE\nPOLLS SHOW. >> GIVEN ALL THE BIG STORIES\nTHAT WERE OUT THERE BETWEEN THE CANDIDATES THIS WEEK, WHICH\nINCLUDED IMMIGRATION, AS I JUST TALKED TO BORIS ABOUT, INCLUDED\nTHE CLINTON FOUNDATION AND SOME OTHER BIG THINGS INCLUDING RACE\nAND BIGOTRY, WHO HAD THE BETTER WEEK?\nWHO HAD THE WORSE WEEK? >> I THINK IT STARTED OUT AS A\nBAD WEEK FOR HILLARY CLINTON AND BECAME A BAD WEEK FOR DONALD\nTRUMP WHO COULDN'T KEEP THINGS FOCUSOD THE CLINTON FOUNDATION\nBY TALKING ABOUT IMMIGRATION AS HE HAS AND, OF COURSE, WITH\nCLINTON MAKING THE RACE SPEECH YESTERDAY.\n>> JONATHAN ALLEN, GOOD TO SEE YOU.\nTHANK YOU.",

IT'S LED TO PUBLIC CALLS THAT\nSHE SHOULD GET PSYCHOLOGICAL HELP.\nTHIS CRISIS THAT HE'S IN TONIGHT COMES FROM THIS SAME ISSUE AREA.\nPAUL LePAGE ONCE AGAIN GOING ON A TEAR ABOUT HOW DANGEROUS --\nBASICALLY HOW DANGEROUS HE FINDS BLACK PEOPLE ON THE BASIS OF\nTHEIR RACE. THIS WEDNESDAY AT A TOWN HALL IN\nTHE TOWN OF NORTH BUR WICK, MAINE, GOVERNOR LePAGE INFORMED\nTHE AUDIENCE, THAT, QUOTE, I'VE BEEN COLLECTING EVERY SINGLE\nDRUG DEALER WHO HAS BEEN ARRESTED IN OUR STATE, I WILL\nTELL YOU THAT 90-PLUS PERCENT OF THOSE PICTURES IN MY BOOK, AND\nIT'S A THREE-RING BINDER, ARE BLACK AND HISPANIC PEOPLE.\nPAUL LePAGE THIS WEEK ANNOUNCING THAT HE HAS A BINDER FULL OF\nBLACK AND HISPANIC PEOPLE.

I THINK IT WAS WRONG FOR THE\nGOVERNOR TO INTERJECT EVERY TIME WE TALK IT THIS ISSUE, ISSUES\nABOUT RACE. I THINK THE ISSUE AND THE\nPROBLEM WE NEED TO SOLVE IS ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE'RE NOT\nINVESTING ENOUGH IN TREATMENT. PEOPLE WHO NEED TREATMENT CAN'T\nGET IT HERE IN MAINE.

WE SAW IMAGES BEFORE.\nIT LOOKS PRETTY BAD. >> IT IS.\nIT'S BEEN A ROUGH NIGHT FOR RESIDENTS OF THE KANSAS CITY\nAREA. THIS IS BY THE WAY, THE FIRST\nTIME THAT THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE HAS ISSUED A FLASH FLOOD\nEMERGENCY FOR KANSAS CITY. I FOUND THAT OUT IN SOME OF MY\nRESEARCH. TAKING A LOOK AT THE FOOTAGE,\nYOU CAN SEE WHAT THEY'RE DEALING WITH.\nTO SAY THE LEAST, PICTURES SPEAK A THOUSAND WORDS HERE.\nTHERE HAVE BEEN TEN SWIFT WATER RESCUES THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE SO\nFAR. STREET CAR SERVICE WAS\nSUSPENDED. PORTIONS OF THAT HIGHWAY THAT\nCIRCUMNAVIGATES THE ENTIRE CITY WAS ACTUALLY SHUT DOWN.\nYOU SEE RESCUERS GOING CAR TO CAR MAKING SURE THERE IS NO ONE\nSTRANDED IN THOSE VEHICLES. IT ONLY TAKES ABOUT A FOOT AND A\nHALF TO PICK UP AN ENTIRE SUV AND LET ALONE A CAR AND WASH IT\nDOWN THE ROAD. NOTICE HOW THE THUNDERSTORMS\nCONTINUE TO MOVE OVER THE KANSAS CITY REGION FOR A PROLONGED\nPERIOD OF TIME. WE'RE TALKING THREE OR FOUR\nHOURS THAT IS WHAT IS CALLED IN THE METEOROLOGICAL WORLD THE\nTRAINING OF THUNDERSTORMS. SO WHEN THEY COME OVER A\nLOCATION FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME THAT'S WHERE WE GET THE\nEXCESSIVE RAINFALL TOTALS. BY THE WAY, I NOTICE THERE'S\nSOME STORMS DEVELOPING JUST TO THE WEST OVER CENTRAL KANSAS\nTHAT COULD BRING MORE RAINFALL TO KANSAS CITY.\nTHE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE HAS\nLIFTED THE FLASH FLOOD WARNINGS FOR THE METRO AREA.\nBUT LOOK AT THE EXCESSIVE RAIN THAT DID FALL ACROSS THAT\nREGION. SEE A LITTLE SHADING IN THE\nSOUTHERN SUBURBS JUST SOUTH OF THE METRO.\nTHEY RECEIVE ANYWHERE BETWEEN 7 AND 8 INCHES.\nTHE OTHER STORY WE'RE FOLLOWING HERE IS THE POTENTIAL\nDEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL ACTIVITY, ACROSS THEBAHAMAS, NO\nOF CUBA. THEY HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF A\nFIVE-DAY DEVELOPMENT ESPECIALLY AS IT CROSSES FLORIDA AND THE\nKEYS. AND LOOK AT THAT, A LOT OF DRY\nAIR AND STRONG UPPER LEVEL WINDS SO THAT IS NOT REALLY CONDUCIVE\nFOR A TROPICAL DEVELOPMENT. WHICH IS GOOD NEWS, GEORGE, WE\nDON'T WANT TO SEE THIS DEVELOP INTO A FULL-BLOWN STORM OR\nHURRICANE. BUT THE MAJOR THREATS GOING\nFORWARD FOR SOUTHERN FLORIDA, HEAVY RAINS.\nNOT A GOOD PLACE TO BE IN",

AS ACTUALLY AS COLD HEARTED AS\nTHAT SOUNDS AND THAT MAY HURT PEOPLE'S FEELINGS, I LOVE THAT\nHE IS ABLE TO STEP UP, OUR PERFORMANCE IS NOT WHERE WE WANT\nIT TO BE WE'RE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN\nI LIKE TO HEAR KASEY KAHNE GET TO THE POINT\n>> THE KEY WORDS SHE WAS SO HONEST, SO\nSTRAIGHTFORWARD. YOU CAN POINT THE FINGER AT THE\nDRIVER, YOU CAN POINT THE FINGER AT THE CREW CHIEF, YOU CAN POINT\nTHE FINGER AT THE ENGINEERING. BUT THE REALITY IS, IT'S A WHOLE\nGROUP OF PEOPLE. DIFFERENT PACKAGES DO DIFFERENT\nDRIVERS. DIFFERENT TIRES DO DIFFERENT\nDRIVERS. I GET IT\nBUT KASEY KAHNE IS A CAPABLE RACE CAR DRIVER.\nBUT THE RESULTS HAVEN'T BEEN THERE.\nAND IF YOU'RE MAKING CHANGES I'VE BEEN PART OF THIS WHERE YOU\nMAKE CHANGES WITH THE CREW CHIEF.\nYOU MAKE CHANGES WITH ENGINEERING AND IT REALLY\nDOESN'T GET ANY BETTER AT THAT POINT, IT'S GOING TO\nEVENTUALLY FALL ON THE DRIVER. KASEY WAS HONEST\nHE SAID, LISTEN, WE GOT TO GET GOING.\nYOU LOOK AT HENDRICK MOTORSPORTS.\nYOU THINK ABOUT THIS JIMMIE JOHNSON IS 40 YEARS OLD\nJUNIOR, 41 YEARS OLD, RIGHT? YOU HAVE TO START LOOKING AT\nWHO'S THE NEXT GUY THEY DID A GREAT JOB IN SIGNING\nCHASE ELLIOTT. THE RISK THEY TOOK WITH CHASE\nELLIOTT IS THAT HE WASN'T GOING TO AS GOOD AS THEY THOUGHT\nHE'S PROVEN TOUR REALLY GOOD POTENTIALLY, HE COULD BE GREAT\nTHE SAME THING WITH WILLIAM BYRON, THEY MADE AN INVESTMENT\nIN A YOUNG DRIVER WHO HAS PROVEN HE CAN WIN RACES\nAND NOW THEY HAVE TWO YOUNG DRIVERS.\nKASEY KAHNE IS ONLY 36 IF YOU WAIT UNTIL A DRIVER\nRAISES HIS HAND AND SAYS I WANT TO RETIRE, IT'S TOO LATE\nYOU NEED TO HAVE BROUGHT A GUY INTO THE PROGRAM\nLET THEM GET USED TO THE PROGRAM.\nTHAT'S WHAT TOYOTA HAS DONE. THEY PUT QUALITY DRIVERS INTO\nTHOSE RACE CARS. THEY HAVE QUALITY DRIVERS, AND\nTHE OTHER MANUFACTURERS AND TEAMS, THEY HAVEN'T FOLLOWED\nTHROUGH WITH THAT. BUT THIS MY EYE, HENDRICK\nMOTORSPORTS, WITH WILLIAM WIRE RON, THEY SAID, LOOK, WE HAVE TO\nLOOK TO THE FUTURE THAT WASN'T ABOUT KASEY KAHNE,\nTHAT WAS ABOUT BRINGING MORE TALENT, MORE FUTURE TALENT IN.\n>> MARTY SNIDER IS WITH ANOTHER YOUNG TALENT\n>> THAT WOULD BE KYLE LARSON >> I THINK OUR TARGET IS PRETTY\nGOOD TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I DON'T\nTHINK IT'S CHANGED A WHOLE LOT FROM WHERE WE UNLOADED\nI THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.\nIN A COUPLE DAYS, IT WAS BETTER YESTERDAY.\nI JUST GOT TIGHT ON MY LAST RUN THERE.\nAND IT DOESN'T IS TAKE A WHOLE LOT OF, YOU KNOW, ME GETTING\nWIDE OPEN AS YOU CAN AND WHEN YOU MISS A DAY IN A\nHALF SECOND OR LESS IT GOES DOWN MILES PER HOUR\nAT THIS POINT, GROWING THE QUICKEST GUY TO THE THIRD.\nI FELT LIKE I CAN TURN IT AROUND A LITTLE BIT MORE THERE.\nI THOUGHT I COULD MOVE AROUND. >> CONSIDERING HOW GOOD THE CAR\nWAS LAST WEEK AT BRISTOL AND HOW GOOD YOU WERE, HOW FRUSTRATING\nHAS IT BEEN WATCH ALL THOSE POINTS GO AWAY\n50 PLUS POINTS? >> YEAH, IT'S BEEN EXTREMELY\nFRUSTRATING. IT'S BEEN OUT OF OUR HANDS IN\nBOTH RACES WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ALL OF\nTHOSE POINTS BACK. AND IT'S NOT BEEN HANDED TO ME\nIN MY NASCAR CAREER. WE'LL KEEP WORKING\nI'VE BEEN REALLY GOOD AT MICHIGAN EVERY TIME I'VE RUN\nHERE I'VE GOT SOMEWHAT CLOSE WINS\nHERE TRY AND RESTART AND HOPEFULLY,\nWE CAN COME OUT WITH A WIN >> THE ENCOURAGING SIDE, YOU\nGUYS ARE CLEARLY BROUGHT UP THE SPEED TO THE TRACK OF LATE\nDO YOU FEEL THAT YOU AND JAMIE McMURRAY HAVE STEPPED IT UP A\nBIT, THE TEAM? >> YEAH, MY THIRD YEAR IN CUP.\nA COUPLE WEEK, I GUESS BRISTOL WAS GOING TO BE OUR FIRST RACE\nWHERE I FEEL LIKE WE CAN GO OUT AND WIN RACES.\nBUT, IT'S A PERFECT KIND OF A YEAR TO GET THAT, IF I WAS IN\nTHE CHASE. AND WILL WILL PROBABLY END UP\nGETTING INTO THE CHASE YEAH, IF WE COULD GET INTO THE\nCHASE, THOSE ARE GOOD TRACKS I THINK WE'LL HAVE A GOOD SHOT\nAT THE CHAMPIONSHIP. IT'S BEEN FRUSTRATING THE LAST\nCOUPLE OF WEEKS. WE'VE HAD SPEED, EVERYWHERE, THE\nLAST COUPLE OF MONTHS. JUST SOME STUFF HASN'T WORKED\nOUT. SO, HOPEFULLY, LUCK WILL BE ON\nOUR SIDE TOMORROW AND WE'LL GET THE BREAK AND GET THE WIN.\n>> THE LAST THING WE TALKED ABOUT ON THE SHOW, CHAD KNAUS,\nTHE CREW CHIEF FELT LIKE THEY COULD WIN IN BRISTOL AND HERE.\n>> THEY'RE SHOW SOMETHING SPEED.",

I THINK WE GOT UP TO 45 MILES AN\nHOUR OR SO IN THAT OPEN CAR WITH NO SEAT\nBELT OBVIOUSLY NO HELMET NOTHING REALLY TO EVEN HOLD ON\nTO IT FELT LIKE WE WERE ABSOLUTELY\nFLYING ALTHOUGH IT'S CERTAINLY NOT MY\nFASTEST RIDE ALONG I'VE EVER DONE, IT WAS CERTAINLY THE MOST\nEXHILARATING WE SEE BRAD PULL INTO THE GARAGE\nNOW.

I DON'T EVEN KNOW.\nANYWAY, HE SAID IT REQUIRED MORE HANDS THAN ONE PERSON.\nIN FACT, WHEN HENRY FORD RACED IT\nHE HAD AN ON-BOARD MECHANIC, THERE WAS LITERALLY A GUY RIDING\nALONG.

THE POSSIBILITY EXISTS, HE GETS\nHIS FIRST EVER WIN IN NASCAR AND IT COMES TOMORROW AFTERNOON\nHERE HOW DOES THAT SHAKE UP THE CHASE\nSTANDINGS? >> WELL, THAT WOULD SHAKE THINGS\nUP A GREAT DEAL. KYLE LARSON OR ANY OF THEM, KEAN\nC KASEY KAHNE, ANY OF THOSE GUYS\nWITH A WIN, NOW, YOU HAVE A WHOLE NEW BALL GAME.\nONLY THREE GUYS. AUSTIN DILLON, AND JAMIE\nMcMURRAY, RYAN NEWMAN RIGHT BEHIND THEM.\nIF A GUY, A NEW WINNER GETS IN, AND HE'S BELOW THAT CUT LINE IT\nCOMPLETELY CHANGES THE GAME. >> KASEY KAHNE IS 19th\nHE'S WON AT HIS RACETRACK BEFORE\nAND A MUST-WIN SITUATION >> WELL, THE CONCERNING PART\nABOUT THIS RACETRACK IS WHAT WE'VE SEEN HERE IN THE PAST\nWHICH MEANS THE MILES RACED. AND WE SAW THE RAIN A COUPLE\nYEARS AGO, IN THE SPRING SO THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY IF\nTHE STRAIGHTFORWARD FASTEST CAR WINS THE RACE WHICH LET'S BE\nCLEAR, THAT'S WHY WE RACE. KYLE LARSON, HE'S THE FASTEST\nCAR HERE, GIVE HIM THE TROPHY. THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS.\nKYLE LARSON HAS DONE A HANDFUL OF BEST RACES IN HIS CAREER.\nHE'S STRUGGLING TO FIND THE BALANCE OF 400 OR 500 MILES,\nMAKING A FEW MISTAKES. SOMETIMES IS SMART BEHIND THE\nWHEEL. GO BACK TO DOVER, HE HAD THAT\nCHANCE TO BEAT MATT KENSETH. PROBABLY COULD HAVE PUT THE\nBUMPER TO IT AND WON IT. >> LET'S GO TO THE GARAGE.\n>> RICK, WE TALKED WHAT THE TEAMS MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE\nLEARNED. FOR THE 19 TEAM OF CARL EDWARDS.\nYOU LOOK BACK THERE BY THE CREW MEMBER, THE RADAR IS UP.\nTHERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THINKING THAT THE RAIN IN THE AREA MAY\nAFFECT THE SECOND PRACTICE SESSION TODAY.\nI'LL TELL YOU WHAT, THIS MAY BE THE ONLY THING THAT TEAMS LEARN\nIN THIS PRACTICE SESSION RODGERS AND CARL EDWARDS WITH A\nLITTLE STEP IN THEIR TURN TRYING TO LEARN WHAT MIGHT BE IN THE\nPRACTICE SESSION TWO KELLY.\n>> WE SAY WHY DO WE STRUGGLE WITH QUALIFYING HERE, THE CREW\nSAYING DON'T WORRY, WE KNOW THAT WE RACE WELL HERE.\nWE ASKED ADAM STEVENS WHAT CAN BE GAINED FROM THIS MORNING'S\nPRACTICE HE SAID, HONESTLY, I DON'T\nREALLY KNOW. I THINK YOU CAN ACTUALLY HURT\nYOURSELF MORE THAN HELP YOURSELF\nYOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING TO THE CAR BALANCEWISE.\nHE SAID THEY'LL PROBABLY WORK ON DIFFERENT SHOCK PACKAGES\nHE FINALLY SAID IF I HAD ANY NERVE AT ALL, I WOULD HAVE TOLD\nEVERYONE TO SHOW UP AN HOUR LATE\nBUT I DIDN'T, SO WE'RE HERE. >> YEAH, I DON'T KNOW IF THAT\nWOULD GO OVER WELL >> AND ONE THING, RICK, WE NEED\nTO REMIND ALL OF THE FANS, NATIONAL WITH MICHIGAN BUT THAT\nPACKAGE THAT NASCAR HAS RUN A FEW TIMES THIS YEAR, THEY'VE RUN\nIT HERE IN THE SPRING AND IN KENTUCKY\nTHE REASON THAT KYLE BUSCH IS PROBABLY A LITTLE CONCERNED NOT\nTHE BEST MICHIGAN RACE HERE. HE GOT TRASH ON HIS GRILL.\nWOUND UP RUNNING TOO WARM, HURTING THE ENGINE\n52 LAPS. YOU SEE A MAJOR ENGINE\nEXPLOSION. ENDED UP FINISHING DEAD LAST\n40th IN THAT RACE. WHILE THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO\nWITH KYLE, YOU KNOW HOW -- YOU DRIVERS ARE FICKLE, FICKLE\nPEOPLE, JEFF THAT'S WHY THE RACE PROBABLY\nDOESN'T GO AS WELL IN THE SPRING\n>> IF YOU'RE NOT ON THE RACETRACK, YOU'RE NOT LEARNING\nHE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE THREE-WIDE, FOUR-WIDE OR\nGOING INTERNAL LIKE AT AMICHIGAN.\nOR JUST THE EXPERIENCE THAT HE DIDN'T GET TO HAVE WITH THIS\nPACKAGE. OBVIOUSLY, YOU LOOK AT THE\nFINISH, HE'S DISAPPOINTED ABOUT THAT\n>> AND KYLE BUSCH MUST BE FRUSTRATED BY THE SIMPLE FACT\nTHAT THIS PACKAGE HAD THAT HE HAD THE ENGINE PROBLEM\nEARLIER THIS YEAR. IF YOU'RE IN MICHIGAN FINISHED\n12th WHERE THEY RAN THAT LOW DOWNFORCE PACKAGE THERE.\nAT THE SAME TIME, NOT WHAT KYLE BUSCH, AS FAR AS FINISHES GO,\nNOT WHAT HE'S HAPPY ABOUT. >> YEAH, IT SEEMS TO SUIT THE\nTEAMMATE CARL EDWARDS A LITTLE BIT.\nAND BOTH OF THEIR DRIVERS HAVE GONE TO VICTORY LANE\nWE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEING AN ENGINE TRACK\nBUT SURPRISINGLY, THAT FAILED ENGINE OF THE 18 CAR, THAT'S THE\nONLY ENGINE DNF IN THE LAST FIVE RACES BY ANY DRIVER.\nSO THE ENGINE COMPANIES HAVE FOUND A WAY TO OUTSMART\nMICHIGAN >> THAT'S RIGHT.\nON TOP OF THE FACT THAT REALLY THIS HAS NOT BEEN THAT GREAT OF\nA RACETRACK. MICHIGAN JUST HASN'T HAD A TON\nOF SUCCESS HERE. 23 STARTS.\nONE WIN. ONLY ONE TOP FIVE AVERAGE.\nJUST NOT THE NUMBERS YOU'RE USED TO LOOKING AT WHEN YOU THINK OF\nKYLE BUSCH >> AND A RACE THAT THAT THIS\nCIRCUIT COMES TO TWICE A YEAR. AND THE NASCAR SPRINT CUP\nCHAMPION NEEDS TO FIGURE OUT SOMETHING BETTER TO GET TO THIS\nRACETRACK. >> WELL, WE TALKED ABOUT IT\nYESTERDAY, CHEVROLET, WITH THE TRUCK RACE, XFINITY RACE, CUP\nRACE THEY WON ALL THE RACES\nTODAY, TOP FIVE OF ALL CHEVROLETS\nAND THERE ARE THREE THAT ARE SECOND AND THIRD\nSO MAYBE CHEVROLET IS STARTING TO CATCH UP A LITTLE BIT WITH\nTOYOTA >> YOU MENTIONED HE NEEDS TO GET\nBETTER HERE. THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT THE\nSPRINT CUP SERIES SCHEDULE YOU NEED TO GET BETTER FOR THE\nWEEKEND BUT IT IS IN THE NEED FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP\nHE'S IN THE CHASE. WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE FINAL TEN\nRACES. >> THE FIVE-LAP AVERAGE, THAT'S\nALSO KYLE LARSON THAT TOPS THE CHARTS",

WHEN WE THOUGHT ABOUT IS THE\nRESTARTS THEY WENT OUT ON TIRES AND MADE\nTHEIR FIRST LAP. THAT TELLS ME THEY HAVE A SETUP\nTHEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT FOR RESTART.\n>> THAT RESTART IS SO IMPORTANT. YOU TALK ABOUT IT, YOU'RE GOING\nINTO IT, TURN ONE, THREE AND FOUR WIDE.\nIT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO HIT THAT SPOT\nAND I THINK, I REALLY BELIEVE THAT THE CLEANER AIR YOU'RE IN,\nTHE BETTER YOU'RE GOING TO BE. I MEAN, THESE CARS, THEY HAVE\nVERY LITTLE GRIP THEY'RE VERY, VERY LITTLE\nDOWNFORCE. WHEN YOU GET AROUND ANOTHER CAR,\nIT'S NOT LIKE IT WORKS TRACK POSITION IS GOING MATTER\n>> THE SCENARIO THAT DENNY IS COMPLAINING ABOUT, COMING OFF\nTHE PIT START -- >> NO HE'S NOT DOING THAT, IF HE\nDID THAT HE WOULD LEAVE PIT ROAD AT A HIGHER SPEED.\n>> NO, NO, HE'S COMING OUT TO TRY RESTART.\n>> YEAH, THAT'S CORRECT.

IT'S DIFFICULT TO FIND A 100%\nCLEAN LANE HE'S JUST GOING TO HAVE TO FIND\nA HOLE AND THEN GET MOVING AGAIN.\n>> HE'S COMING UP ON THE RESTART AGAIN.\n>> THERE'S A RESTART GOING THERE'S THE FIRST ONE AND\nTHERE'S THE SECOND ONE HE HAS TO RESTART WITHIN THAT\nZONE >> HERE HE GOES.\nGOING INTO TURN NUMBER ONE AGAIN, COLD TIRES, IN ESSENCE,\nBECAUSE HE JUST CAME OFF OF PIT ROAD\n>> HE RADIOED, HE'S SEEN NO ONE RUN THAT LINE THE ENTIRE DAY\nBECAUSES THAT NOT THE FAST LANE. WANTED TO GET A FEEL OF WHAT\nIT'S GOING TO DO DOWN THERE. THAT'S WHERE YOU GOT TO GO, THE\nYELLOW LINE. AND THE ROUTE HE COULD POSSIBLY\nGO >> YEAH, BECAUSE IF I'M ON THE\nOUTSIDE, I'M GOING TO TRY TO PUT MYSELF IN THE PREFERRED LANE\nI'M GOING TO PUSH JEFF GORDON ALL THE WAY TO THE APRON IF I\nCAN. AND THIS IS WHAT WE TEACH\nYOUNGER DRIVERS. YOU MENTIONED ROOKIES PRACTICING\nTHIS HOW HE APPROACHES THIS I THINK\nIS A GLIMPSE INTO THE MIND-SET OF WHAT A BIG COMPANY LIKE\nTOYOTA WORKS ON. >> AND FOR DENY NOT ONLY WAS\nTHIS PROBABLY FOR HIM, BUT THE TRG ENGINEERS, THEY'RE LOOKING\nAT THE DATA, THEY WANT TO SEE THE ACCELERATION\nMAYBE TRY DIFFERENT AIR PRESSURES CAN HE RUN UP THE\nRACETRACK OR A DIFFERENT LINE. THE OTHER REASON HE WANTS TO RUN\nTHE BOTTOM IS BY THE TRACK IT'S MUCH FASTER\nWE JUST HEARD CREW CHIEFS TALK ABOUT WELL, WHAT CAN WE REALLY\nLEARN? IF YOU'RE WILLING TO LEARN, IF\nYOU'RE WILLING TO LOOK, IF YOU'RE WILLING TO QUESTION\nYOURSELF PUSH THE ENGINEERING, PUSH THE\nMANUFACTURER, YOU CAN LEARN. SOME PEOPLE THINK YOU'RE NUTTY\n>> THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE NOT WINNING.\n>> RIGHT YOU HAVE TO SHUT OFF THE NOISE\nAND SAY HERE'S WHAT WE'RE DOING, AND HERE'S WHY WE'RE DOING IT.\nAND JUST GO DO IT. >> A PERFECT EXAMPLE, AND WE'VE\nPOINTED THIS OUT MANY TIMES BECAUSE IT'S REFLECTED WHEN HE\nDOES IT, IT'S JIMMIE JOHNSON PRACTICING BIT STOPS\nGETTING IN AND OUT OF HIS PIT STALL.\nA 77-TIME RACE WINNER THAT WILL ON PRACTICE DAY, THEY WILL GO\nOUT THERE, THEY WILL PRACTICE GETTING INTO HIS PIT STALL AND\nGETTING BACK OUT OF HIS PIT STALL.\nYOU THINK WHY DO THEY DO THAT? IT'S NOT CHANGING?\nBUT JUST TO GET BETTER TO GET MORE INFORMATION.\nTHAT'S WHAT WE'VE SEEN 11 DO >> WELL, THE FIRST ONE LOOKED\nVERY SMOOTH TO ME, JEFF. THE SECOND ONE, WATCH THE TAIL\nHE'S GOING TO TRY TO GET TO THE POWER.\nSOMEWHERE IN HERE, HE'S GOING TO GET ON THE GAS\nSECOND GEAR, RIGHT THERE YOU SEE THE TAIL MOVE BACK AND\nFORTH. THAT'S BECAUSE HE'S BY HIMSELF\nTHAT'S THE REAR TIRES LOSING TRACTION JUST FOR A SECOND\n>> IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE WATCHING HERE, WELL, WHAT'S THE\nBIG DEAL I CAN ASSURE YOU IF YOU PUT 39\nOTHER CARS AROUND HIM, IF THAT TAIL MOVES AROUND, THAT GUY ON\nTHE OUTSIDE GETS AROUND. THAT'S AN UNSUCCESSFUL RESTART\nHE'S LOSING POSITION. >> THAT'S THE THIRD TIME THAT\nWE'VE SEEN THE 11 DO A RESTART PRACTICE\n>> AND THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF WHEEL SPIN WILL EXACTLY CREATE\nTHAT OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO NOT HAVE SUCCESS IN THE RACE YOU\nWANT HERE'S AUSTIN DILLON STARTING\nNEXT TO CARL EDWARDS COMING IN THE RESTART ZONE\nHE'S IN THE RESTART ZONE GOES EARLY\nNO BLACK FLAG. NO BLACK FLAG HERE\nSO, THE 19th SPINNING THE TIRES, BACK OF THE CAR MOVING AROUND,\nLIKE YOU JUST SAW. DID NOT EVEN GO TURN ONE, EVEN\nCLOSE IN THE LEAD. SO, THAT'S WHY YOU PRACTICE.\nTHAT'S WHY YOU STUDY FILM. THAT'S WHY YOU PAY ATTENTION TO\nEVERYTHING IN THAT'S GOING ON. BECAUSE EVERYTHING MATTERS\nYOU DON'T KNOW IF THAT CRUCIAL RESTART IS GOING TO BE FIVE TO\nGO YOU DON'T HIT IT, YOU DON'T KNOW\nHOW BIG OF AN IMPACT EVERY DAY WITH THIS COMPETITION,\nYOU HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING RIGHT IF YOU'RE GOING TO WIN THIS.\n>> BASICALLY, RICK, THAT'S HOW YOU USE 8:30 A.M.

WENT UP FROM 1.5 AND CHANGE\nEARLIER IN THE SESSION. THE DOLLAR MANAGED TO CLOSE\nSHARPLY HIGHER AND YOU LOOK AT SORT OF THE HIGH YIELD PLAYS,\nUTILITY, INTEL, COM. THEY WERE THE SHARPEST DECLINERS\nAMONG S&P SECTORS HERE, SO HOW DO WE PARSE THIS IN YOUR?\n>> THE S&P 500 WAS DOWN TODAY, BUT IT WASN'T REALLY LIKE A\nCRATER. WASN'T DOWN 1 OR 2%.\nBARELY DOWN. SO, WE HAD A LOT OF INTRADAY\nVOLATILITY. FOR ME, I FOCUS ON THE CURRENCY\nMARKETS. THE DOLLAR INDEX IS TELLING YOU\nSOMETHING. IT WASN'T DOWN THAT MUCH.\nTHERE'S SOMETHING IN THERE FOR EVERYBODY.\nPEOPLE LISTEN TO STAN FISHER. THAT MEANS THE DOLLAR'S BEING\nSTRONG. THAT'S WHERE I WOULD STAY.\n>> STOP SIGN FISHER IS THE SAME GUY THAT SAID THEY WERE GOING TO\nGO FOUR TIMES. FROMs CONSIDER THE SOURCE.\nI DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE DOING THE DIRTY WORK, WHAT I WOULD SAY\nIS YOU KNOW, BILL DUDLEY AND WHO ELSE DID WE GET?\nEVANS. WE HAD A CASE WHERE WE HAD A LOT\nOF FED SPEAKER, BUT ULTIMATELY, THE CASE IS THERE'S STARTING TO\nBE SOME CONSISTENCY WITH THIS MESSAGE, BUT TO THEIR CREDIT,\nIT'S COMING AFTER HOUSING MARKET IS TARTING TO REALLY TAKE OFF.\nWE HAVE WAGE GROWTH, A DURABLES NUMBER YESTERDAY THAT HAD THE\nCOMPONENT COMING ALIVE SO, TO SAY THESE GUYS DON'T HAVE A\nREASON TO BE MORE POSITIVE, THEY'RE MORE CONSTRUCTIVE ON THE\nECONOMY AND THAT MAKES A TON OF SENSE TO ME.\n>> I THINK THEY'VE HAD DATA THAT'S LOOKED POSITIVE ALREADY.\nTHERE'S BEEN SO MANY TIMES WHERE THEY COULD HAVE RAISED RATES.\nTHEY'VE CHOSEN NOT TO. LAST NIGHT, WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT\nHAPPENED HAPPEN. WE SAID UTILITIES STAPLES WILL\nPROBABLY SELL OFF. GOLD WOULD PROBABLY SELL OFF AND\nWHAT WOULD RUN WOULD BE FINANCIALS.\nGOT A LITTLE OF THAT. GOT THE UTILITIES.\nDIDN'T GET ENOUGH OF FINANCIALS, SO I THINK FINANCIALS ARE STUCK\nBETWEEN THAT GETTING SPOOKED OF HIGHER RATES FOR THE OVERALL\nMARKET, BUT POSITIVE ABOUT IT FOR THE FINANCIALS SPECIFICALLY.\n>> THE REASON WHY I ASKED STEVE AND I USED THE WORD DIRTY WORK,\nBECAUSE THE MARKET EXPECTATION IS ESSENTIALLY LOW IN TERMS OF\nRATE HIKE IN SEPTEMBER. AND SO AFTER YELLEN SPOKE, IT\nSEEM SORT OF LIKE MORE OF THE SAME AN THEN FISHER CAME OUT AND\nIT SORT OF WAS LIKE, NO, THIS IS ACTUALLY COULD HAPPEN.\nWHETHER OR NOT YOU BELIEVE FISHER AS A SOURCE.\n>> I BELIEVE HIM. TO TIM'S POINT, THE DATA HAS\nBEEN BETTER. ALL THE GOAL POSTS THEY'VE PUT\nFORTH HAVE BEEN MET, SO WHY WOULDN'T THEY MOVE IN SEPTEMBER?\nI WOULD SAY THEY'RE RAISING INTO AN EARNINGS RECESSION, BUT I\nDON'T THINK THAT'S THE POINT AT THIS POINT.\nI DO THINK THEY SHOULD MOVE IN SEPTEMBER.\nI THINK THEY'LL GET SOME CREDE BABILITY PACK.\nWHAT MY CONCERN IS AGAIN IS THIS YIELD CURVE F, WHICH BY THE WAY,\nCONTINUES TO FLATTEN OUT. WHETHER IT'S GOOD FOR BANKS, BAD\nFOR BANK, IT'S HAPPENED BEFORE, I DON'T KNOW, BUT WHAT DOES IT\nSIGNAL FOR THE ECONOMY WHEN YOU HAVE A YIELD CURVE THAT\nCONTINUES TO HAPPEN? I THINK TEN YEAR, SIFT BACK DOWN\nTO 1.45%. ON THE FRONT, YOU'LL SEE THE\nFRONT END MOVE UP. >> I THINK YOU BUY INTO THE BOND\nMARK AND YULETYTIES. EVERYBODY'S EXPECTING THIS GDP.\nIT JUST HASN'T. WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT.\n>> BAD THING -- >> WHAT DO YOU BUY, RIGHT?\nIF YOU WANT YIELD, YOU BAYOU TILLTY, BOBD BONDS.\n>> BUT I THINK WHAT WE'RE GETTING HERE IS FIRST OF ALL,\nTHIS WAS COMING OFF OF THE MOST EXTREME SHOBLG WE'VE HAD IN\nFINANCIAL MARKETS FOR THE ECONOMY.\nTHE FOURTH LONGEST CYCLE SINCE THE 1800s AND WE HAVE A PLACE\nTHAT'S NEVER IMPRESSED ANYBODY AND WHAT'S IMPRESSIVE IS THAT\nTHE ECONOMY DOESN'T DIE OF OLD AGE THEN WE'RE ACTUALLY\nCONTINUES TO GO AND TRUDGE HIGHER.\nIF SOME OTHER COMPONENTS ARE STARTING TO PICK UP AND\nUNDERSTANDABLY, WE'RE REALLY WAITING FOR OTHER SIGNS.\nIN BUSINESS INVESTMENT STILL ON THE SIDELINES, THIS IS\nULTIMATELY CONSTRUCTIVE. >> I'M 25 BASIS POINTS BECAUSE\nTHE WORLD IS A BETTER PLACE IS A VERY CONSTRUCTIVE BACKDROP AND\nBANKS CAN MAKE MONEY IN THIS ENVIRONMENT.\nAND YOU KNOW, PEOPLE THINK BANK ON THE FLY YIELD CURVE DON'T\nMAKE MONEY. DO YOUR HISTORY.\nBANKS WERE TRADING AT FLAT MULTIPLES.\n>> IT'S BECAUSE OF -- MOST OF THEM ARE GOOD PORTION OF THE\nLOANS ARE TIED TO LIBOR. BANKS ARE GOING TO MAKE MONEY.\n>> THEY'VE BEEN BEAT P UP SO BAD.\n>> AND GET YIELD. GET THEM ON VALUATION, YIELD AND\nYOU POTENTIALLY GET THIS TAIL WIND OF HIGHER RATES.\n>> HERE'S THE MAJOR THING, REEFS ARE COMING OUT, 18% OF THE\nFINANCIALS. THAT'S BEEN THE REAL YIELD\nINSIDE OF FINANCIALS. THEY'RE COMING OUT AUGUST 31st,\nSO I WONDER WHAT THAT DOES TO",

HERE'S A SMALL PART OF BOTH\nTHEIR ADS. >> THEY ARE OFTEN THE KINDS OF\nKIDS THAT ARE CALLED SUPERPREDATORS, NO EMPATHY.\nWE CAN TALK ABOUT WHY THEY ENDED UP THAT WAY.\nWE HAVE TO BRING THEM TO HEAL. >> YOU CALLED OUT DEFENDING THE\nUSE OF THE TERM SUPER PREDATOR. WHY DID YOU CALL HIM OUT?\n>> IT WAS A RACIST TERM AND EVERYBODY KNEW IT WAS A RACIST\nTERM. >> I HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP\nWITH THE BLACKS. >> WHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO\nLOSE? >> NOW, DONALD TRUMP IS EXPECTED\nTO SPEAK HERE IN DES MOINES, IOWA, IN JUST A FEW HOURS.\nHE'LL BE ATTENDING SENATOR JOANIE ERNST EVENTS HERE.\nDONALD TRUMP IS MET WITH CERTAINLY SOME STERN WORDS THIS\nMORNING FROM THE SENATOR, WHO WAS ONCE CONSIDERED A POTENTIAL\nVP PICK FOR HIM. SHE TELLS \"THE WASHINGTON POST\"\nIN AN INTERVIEW THAT BOTH CANDIDATES NEED TO TONE DOWN THE\nRHETORIC. SHE SAID THEY NEED TO TAKE THIS\nINTO CIVIL DISCOURSE. I SAY TO BOTH OF THEM BACK DOWN\nAND CALLS FOR BOTH OF THEM TO RETURN TO ISSUES OVER THIS SORT\nOF NAME CALLING AND RHETORIC. WE'LL SEE WHEN DONALD TRUMP\nSPEAKS HERE IN JUST A FEW HOURS, FRED, IF HE STICKS TO THAT\nADVICE FROM THE SENATOR.",

HE'S THE FORMER HEAD OF\nBREITBART NEWS, WHICH OF COURSE MADE HIM THE CENTERPIECE OF\nHILLARY CLINTON'S SCATHING ALT-RIGHT SPEECH YESTERDAY.\nTODAY IT'S A POLITICO STORY THAT DIGS UP AN ACCUSATION OF\nDOMESTIC VIOLENCE FROM TWO DECADES AGO.\nAND THE GUARDIAN IS ALSO REPORTING THAT BANNON MAY BE IN\nVIOLATION OF ELECTION LAW BECAUSE HE'S REGISTERED TO VOTE\nAT A HOUSE IN FLORIDA THAT'S ABANDONED AND WHERE HE HAS NEVER\nLIVED. WE ARE BACK WITH THE SOUTHERN\nPOVERTY LAW CENTER'S HEIDI BYRICK IN MONTGOMERY, ALABAMA\nAND BLOOMBERG BUSINESS WEEK'S JOSH GREEN IN WASHINGTON, D.C.\nJOSH, YOU ARE OUR RESIDENT BANNON-OLOGIST.\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN WOULD CLEARLY LIKE AMERICANS TO\nBELIEVE THAT THIS GUY IS REALLY RUNNING THE SHIP OVER AT THE\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN. WE HAVE SEEN A LOT MORE ON TV OF\nKELLYANNE CONWAY, THE CAMPAIGN MANAGER.\nI'M WONDERING WHERE DO YOU SEE BANNON'S FINGERPRINTS IN THE NEW\nVERSION OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN? >> WELL, WHERE I SEE HIS EFFECT\nIS WHEN YOU GUYS ARE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER, THIS LATEST\nSCANDAL WHERE AS SOON AS CLINTON WAS OUT WITH THIS KU KLUX KLAN\nAD, TRUMP HIT RIGHT BACK WITH THE VIDEO.\nTHAT I THINK WAS BANNON. HE WAS BROUGHT IN TO BE MUCH\nMORE AGGRESSIVE, GET THE CAMPAIGN TO BE A LITTLE MORE\nNIMBLE, MORE ADEPT AT USING SOCIAL MEDIA BEYOND JUST DONALD\nTRUMP'S TWITTER FEED. SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT HE'S BEEN\nFOCUSED ON IN THE WEEK OR SO HE'S BEEN THERE.\n>> HEIDI, LET ME ASK THIS. THE STEVE BANNON HAS PROUDLY\nSAID BREITBART IS A FLAGSHIP MEDIA ENTERPRISE FOR THE\nALT-RIGHT. DO PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY ARE PART\nOF THE ALT-RIGHT, FOR EXAMPLE, WHITE SUPREMACISTS, THE KIND OF\nPEOPLE YOU TALKED ABOUT EARLIER, DO THEY LOOK AT BREITBART AS THE\nMAIN SOURCE OF THEIR NEWS? HOW DO THEY SEE THIS MEDIA\nENTERPRISE THAT HE BUILT? >> THEY LOVE BREITBART.\nI MEAN, THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY THRILLED WITH THE DIRECTION THE\nSITE HAS TAKEN IN THE LAST YEAR. THEY ARE CONSTANTLY RETWEETING\nAND COMMENTING ON HEADLINES THERE THAT THEY FIND ATTRACTIVE\nAND FOR THEM, FOR THE WHITE SUPREMACISTS IN THIS MOVEMENT,\nTHEY FEEL LIKE BREITBART HAS FINALLY VALIDATED THEM.\nTHEY HAVE FINALLY BROKEN INTO MAINSTREAM NEWS THROUGH THAT\nWEBSITE. >> JOSH, I'M CURIOUS WHAT YOU\nSEE AS WE LOOK PAST NOVEMBER. I REALIZE WE ARE GETTING DOWN TO\nTHE WIRE BUT IF IN FACT DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT WIN THIS\nELECTION, DO YOU SEE A FUTURE BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND STEVE\nBANNON IN SOME WAY? >> I DO.\nYOU COULD EVEN POSSIBLY FOLD IN ROGER AILES.\nYOU HAVE ALL THREE OF THEM WORKING AT TRUMP TOWER ON BEHALF\nOF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT HOW CONSERVATISM\nHAS CHANGED, WHERE THE ENERGY IS, WHAT IT IS THAT BANNON AND\nBREITBART HAVE TAPPED INTO, THEY REALLY REPRESENT I THINK AND\nSPEAK FOR A LOT OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION OF CONSERVATIVES, THE\nONES WHO ARE MORE SOCIALLY ADEPT, WHEREAS FOX NEWS AS WE\nALL KNOW TENDS TO HAVE A MUCH OLDER DEMOGRAPHIC.\nYOU COULD CERTAINLY SEE POTENTIALLY IF TRUMP ISN'T\nELECTED PRESIDENT THAT THE TWO OF THEM COULD GET TOGETHER AND\nINVEST MORE IN BREITBART AND MAYBE EXPAND TO A TV STATION OR\nEXPAND TO OTHER COUNTRIES WHICH BREITBART IS ALREADY TRYING TO\nDO AND REALLY KIND OF TAP INTO THIS ENERGY AND GROW SOMETHING\nBEYOND JUST THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. >> I WILL STICK WITH YOU, JOSH.\nIT'S KIND OF IRONIC. PAUL MANAFORT LEFT THE CAMPAIGN,\nSAYING HE HAD TO LEAVE BECAUSE THE VARIOUS NEGATIVE STORIES\nABOUT HIM AND HIS WORK ABROAD IN UKRAINE, FOR EXAMPLE, HAVE\nBECOME A DISTRACTION. NOW STEVE BANNON, DOMESTIC\nVIOLENCE STORY, THE OTHER STORY THAT KASIE MENTIONED ABOUT THE\nHOUSE IN FLORIDA, THOSE WOULD SEEM TO BE DISTRACTIONS ALSO.\nDO YOU THINK THOSE ARE THE KIND OF THINGS THAT WILL BOTHER\nDONALD TRUMP OR WILL -- DID HE KNOW WHAT HE WAS GETTING WHEN HE\nBROUGHT STEVE BANNON IN? >> I DON'T SEE A WHOLE LOT OF\nEVIDENCE THAT DONALD TRUMP CARES ABOUT THESE SORTS OF THINGS.\nTHAT HE'S AN OUTSIDER, WHAT ATTRACTED HIM TO BANNON\nORIGINALLY BEFORE HE EVEN STARTED CAMPAIGNING, HE SOUGHT\nBANNON OUT FOR ADVICE, IS THE FACT HE WAS AN OUTSIDER, OUTSIDE\nTHE REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT. ALL ALONG TRUMP'S BRAND AND\nINTEREST SEEMS TO BE THAT HE DON'T WANT TO DO THINGS THE\nNORMAL WAY, HE WANTS TO BE DIFFERENT IN EVERY FACET.\nPART OF IT ALSO IS HE REALLY CAN'T ATTRACT THE MAINSTREAM\nREPUBLICAN TALENT THAT YOU WOULD ORDINARILY SEE A GOP NOMINEE\nBEING ABLE TO DRAW ON. SO HE WINDS UP WITH THIS MOTLEY\nGROUP OF ADVISERS WHO WHEN REPORTERS TAKE A LOOK INTO THEIR\nBACKGROUND DON'T ALWAYS TURN OUT TO BE THE CLEANEST, MOST\nUPSTANDING MEMBERS OF CITIZENRY. >> UNDERSTATEMENT THERE.\n>> INDEED.

I DON'T MEAN TO CUT YOU OFF.\nWE'LL HAVE YOU HERE THROUGHOUT THE MORNING BUT I'VE GOT TO GET\nTHIS NUMBER IN, BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM THE\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN AND CLINTON AND KAINE, VOTERS IN THE QUINNIPIAC\nPOLL ON THURSDAY, 59% POLLED SAID THEY AGREE THE WAY DONALD\nTRUMP TALKS APPEALS TO BIGOTRY. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS\nCREATED BY THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN, IS THIS NOT A REAL PROBLEM WITH\nVOTERS, WITH WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAYS AT LEAST?\n>> IT'S NOT JUST DONALD TRUMP, THIS IS A BROKEN RECORD OF THE\nDEMOCRATS. THEY DO THIS EVERY ELECTION\nCYCLE. THEY PAINT REPUBLICANS AS BEING\nRACISTS. AT THIS TIME IN 2012, MITT\nROMNEY WAS POLLING ZERO WITH THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND\nBEING TERMED A RACE THE. GEORGE W. BUSH SAY RACIST.\nTHIS IS WHAT THEY DO. IT WORKS BECAUSE IT PULLS TO THE\nEMOTION. IF YOU THINK THAT IT WORKFORCE\nTHE COMMUNITIES, OBVIOUSLY WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT MORE PEOPLE\nNOW ON FOOD STAMPS. LESS HOME OWNERSHIP WITHIN THE\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES, THERE'S A PROBLEM.\nWHY DON'T THEY LOOK FOR A SOLUTION TO BE PANDERING WHICH\nIS EXACTLY WHAT SHE'S DOING. >> SCOTT, LET ME COME TO YOU,\nAFTER THE CLINTON SPEECH ON THURSDAY, THERE WAS NO HUGE RUSH\nOF REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS OF CONSERVATIVES NOT COMMITTED TO\nTHE CAMPAIGN, TO DEFEND DONALD TRUMP AGAINST THIS.\nBUT AFTER THESE COMMENTS BY TIM KAINE WE ARE SEEING THAT.\nHAS SENATOR KAINE STEPPED ON THE CLINTON MESSAGE?\n>> NO, I DON'T THINK SO AT ALL. LISTEN, THOSE 60% OF THE VOTERS\nARE -- THOSE 60% OF THE VOTERS ARE NOT GETTING THESE RACIST AND\nSUPPORT OF BIGOTRY FROM ANYONE BUT DONALD TRUMP.\nHE HAS BROUGHT THIS ON HIMSELF. BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE\nCITATION INFORMATION THE REPORT IN HIS OWN WORDS, HE'S BRINGING\nIT ON HIMSELF. WHAT'S MORE TELLING IS, IS THAT\nAFTER HE'S BEEN ACCUSED OF ALL OF THESE THINGS, NOT ONE\nREPUBLICAN LEADER HAS TWEETED OR COME OUT TO DEFEND HIM.\nTHE REPORT IN \"THE WASHINGTON POST\" THAT RAISED THAT QUESTION.\nSO, NOW, I DON'T THINK TIM KAINE IS STEPPING ON THE MESSAGE.\nHE'S CARRYING FORTH THE MESSAGE THAT HILLARY CLINTON LAID OUT A\nCOUPLE DAYS AGO THAT IS, AGAIN, DOCUMENTED, IT HAD CITATIONS AND\nREPORTS. AND USED DONALD TRUMP'S OWN\nWORDS AGAINST HIM. AND REPUBLICANS GOING FORWARD\nAGAINST HIM. AND WE'RE GOING TO --\n>> CAN I GET -- >> HOLD ON, HOLD ON.\n>> WITHOUT THE TELEPROMPTER HE --\n>> HOLD ON.

WE'RE LISTENING TO VOTERS, BUT\nI'M STICKING TO WHAT MATT SAID, PEOPLE HAVE TO LEAVE THIS\nCOUNTRY TO GET BACK HERE LEGALLY.\n>> THERE IS ANOTHER TOPIC THAT IS AN ISSUE TODAY, AND THAT IS\nTHE NEW CAMPAIGN MANAGER FOR DONALD TRUMP, WHO HAS\nREVELATIONS THAT CNN WAS CHARGED WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, A\nMISDEMEANOR. FIRST OF ALL, THAT ISSUE, TIED O\nOTHER CAMPAIGN APPOINTMENTS THAT HE HAS HAD.\nROGER AILES, AN INFORMAL ADVISOR.\nAND GOING AFTER REPUBLICAN WOMEN, IT IS IMPORTANT FOR HIM\nTO WIN THIS ELECTION. HOW DOES THAT WORK?\n>> THIS TIES IN WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY ABOUT IMMIGRATION AS\nWELL. IT IS ALL CONNECTED.\nDONALD TRUMP CAN'T WIN 65% OF WHITE VOTERS AND NOT 30% OF\nMINORITI MINORITIES.\nHE NEEDS FEMALES TO GET THE 65%. THIS IS BAD OPTICS TO SAY THE\nLEAST IF IS NEWS STORIES THAT THEY HAVE TO DEFEND AND COME UP\nWITH. YOU ALREADY HAVE ALL OF THE\nLEFT-WING ACTIVISTS FRINGE ATTACKING HIM.\nSO THERE IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE SOME KIND OF, MAYBE CHANGING\nSOME PUBLIC POSITIONS, BUT THIS IS ALSO TRUE FOR IMMIGRATION.\nHE IS NOT LISTENING TO VOTERS, HE IS LOOKING TO SAY HE CAN'T\nWIN IF YOU DON'T HAVE LARGE SHARES OF THE MINORITY\nPOPULATION, THIS THAT IS JUST THE PATH.\n>> I WANT THEM TO BE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY OF EVERY GROUP\nACROSS AMERICA. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO\nLISTEN TO PEOPLE. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO\nARE NOT FAIR, THEY BROKE THE LAW, GEORGE W. BUSH OFFERED\nSOMETHING VERY SIMILARLY. YOU HAVE TO THROW PROFICIENCY IN\nENGLISH, AND YOU HAVE TO FILL OUT THE PAPER WORK, AND THEN YOU\nCAN COME BACK. I THINK IT IS THE RIGHT PLACE TO\nBE.

WHY ARE THINGS NOW BECOMING AS\nIT RELATES TO IMMIGRATION, SO MUCH MORE COMPLICATED?\n>> WELL, IT'S NOT REALLY COMPLICATED.\nMR. TRUMP IS SIMPLY TRYING TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT\nNEEDS TO HAPPEN AND WHAT HE WANTS TO DO.\nHE HAS SAID MANY TIMES AT MANY RALLIES HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE\nLIKE BARACK OBAMA AND SIGNING EXECUTIVE ORDERS.\nHE WILL HAVE TO WORK WITH CONGRESS TO GET THE MORE COMPLEX\nTHINGS DONE. HIS OVERALL MESSAGE HAS NOT\nCHANGED. THERE IS NO PATH TO CITIZENSHIP\nOR PATH TO LEGALIZATION. THOSE HERE ILLEGALLY WILL HAVE\nTO LEAVE. TO COME BACK, THEY HAVE TO PAY\nFINES AND TAXES TO QUALIFY FOR REENTRY AFTER THEY GET TO THE\nBACK OF THE LINE.

THERE IS NO NEGOTIATION THERE.\n>> THERE IS NO NEGOTIATION ON THE WALL BUT THERE IS KNOW\nGOINGS ON PERHAPS WHO HAS TO LEAVE, WHEN THEY HAVE TO LEAVE,\nHOW THEY ARE GOING TO BE QUOTE/UNQUOTE ROUNDED UP?\n>> HE WILL PUT FORTH HIS VISION ON HOW HE THINKS IT SHOULD BE\nDONE IN HIS SPEECH. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT NOVEMBER\nAND WHO IS GOING TO BE LEADER OF THIS COUNTRY.\nTHERE IS THE ONLY DISCUSSION ON IMMIGRATION WE SHOULD BE HAVING.\nHERE ARE YOUR CHOICES. YOU HAVE A CANDIDATE, DONALD\nTRUMP, WHO DOES NOT WANT AMNESTY, WHO WANTS TO BUILD A\nWALL TO KEEP DRUG TRAFFICKING AND SEX TRAFFICKING OUT OF THIS\nCOUNTRY. AND WANTS TO ENFORCE OUR CURRENT\nLAWS. THE OTHER OPTION, HILLARY\nCLINTON HAS ALREADY SAID IN HER FIRST 100 DAYS SHE WANTS\nAMNESTY. SHE DOESN'T LIKE THE LAW AND SHE\nIS NOT INTERESTED IN ENFORCING THESE LAWS WE CURRENTLY HAVE ON\nTHE BOOKS. THOSE ARE THE TWO CHOICES PEOPLE\nHAVE IN NOVEMBER. >> YOU THINK ABOUT HILLARY\nCLINTON'S MAJOR FLAWS OR WEAK SPOTS.\nTHE LIST GOES ON. WE DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME\nLEFT THOUGH. WHY NOT HIT HER CONSISTENTLY ON\nTHOSE THINGS. WHY AS WE'VE SEEN OVER THE PAST\nWEEK GIVE HER OPENINGS AND GET THE PRESS OPENINGS BY GOING\nAFTER HILLARY CLINTON ON THINGS LIKE CALLING HER A BIGOT OR\nUSING THESE WORDS THE PRESS USES AS DISTRACTION?\n>> MR.

THAT'S WHY HER TRUST NUMBERS ARE\nEXTREMELY LOW. I THINK THEY'RE AT 29% NOW.\nMR. TRUMP WANTS TO TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING BECAUSE HE WANTS TO\nBE PRESIDENT FOR EVERYONE IN THE COUNTRY.\n>> ALL RIGHT.

IT WAS A VERY, VERY SAD DAY,\nI THINK, FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THIS COUNTRY.\nAND, BELIEVE ME, THE WORLD IS WATCHING AND THE WORLD IS\nLAUGHING. THEY CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THIS\nIS HAPPENING TO THE UNITED STATES.\n>> AND YOU SAY THAT YOU WOULD BE THE LAW AND ORDER\nCANDIDATE AND, IN FACT, IF YOU ARE ELECTED THE NEXT\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, WOULD YOU CONTINUE\nTHIS INVESTIGATION INTO HER EMAIL SCANDAL?\n>> WELL, I WILL TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT AT A LATER DATE\nBUT CERTAINLY THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE A\nPOSSIBILITY. AND WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT\nVERY SERIOUSLY. THIS IS A VERY, VERY GREAT\nMARK ON THE UNITED STATES. AND PEOPLE ARE VERY, VERY\nUPSET. I'M A BIG FAN OF THE FBI.\nI ALWAYS HAVE BEEN. AND THAT THEY WOULD HAVE\nDONE THIS IS, TO ME, HARD TO BELIEVE.\nAND THEN, OF COURSE, JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WITH THE MEETING\nWITH BILL CLINTON IN THE BACK OF AN AIRPLANE.\nTHESE THINGS HAVE NEVER HAPPENED IN OUR COUNTRY.\nWHAT'S GOING ON WITH OUR COUNTRY AND WITH LAW\nENFORCEMENT, THIS IS -- THESE ARE THINGS THAT HAVE\nNEVER HAPPENED. >> IT DEFINITELY IS CASTING\nSOME DOUBT ON THE, YOU KNOW, INTEGRITY OF THE JUSTICE\nSYSTEM AND CERTAINLY WE DON'T WANT THAT.\nLET ME GET BACK TO IMMIGRATION FOR A MOMENT.\nMANY ARE SAYING THAT YOUR STANCE ON IMMIGRATION HAS\nCHANGED. YOU HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE\nOPINING ON THIS. I WANT TO ASK YOU DIRECTLY.\nDO YOU BELIEVE IN AMNESTY AND ARE YOU SOFTENING YOUR\nTONE? >> MY STANCE IS VERY STRONG.\nIT'S GOING TO REMAIN VERY STRONG.\nTHERE WILL BE NO AMNESTY. THERE IS NO RELATION.\n -- LEGALIZATION.\nWE ARE GOING TO BUILD A WALL, A TREMENDOUS POWERFUL\nWALL. WE WILL HAVE GREAT\nTECHNOLOGY ALONG WITH THE WALL.\nWE ARE GOING TO STOP PEOPLE FROM COMING IN.\nDAY ONE WE ARE GOING TO GET ALL OF THE GANG MEMBERS AND\nTHE GANG LEADERS AND THE DRUG DEALERS AND ALL OF\nTHESE PEOPLE THAT HAVE IS ILLEGALLY CROSSED AND THEY\nHAVE BEEN IN OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE GOING TO GET THEM OUT\nVERY, VERY, VERY FAST. AND WE WILL, NUMBER ONE, I\nHAVE TO SECURE AND WE HAVE TO SECURE THE BORDER.\nWE ARE GOING TO SECURE THE BORDER LIKE IT'S NEVER BEEN\nSECURED BEFORE. WE'RE GOING TO STOP THE\nDRUGS FROM COMING IN. WE'RE GOING TO STOP CERTAIN\nPEOPLE, CRIMINAL ELEMENTS FROM COMING.\nIN THEN WE SHALL SEE WHAT WE SHALL SEE.\n>> WELL, YOU KNOW, AS A PROSECUTOR, I FOUND IT VERY\nFRUSTRATING THAT WE WERE NOT OBSERVING AND ENFORCING THE\nLAWS THAT ARE ON THE PECULIARS AND PEOPLE WOULD\nBE REVOLVING DOOR COMING BACK.\nIN I WAS A PROSECUTOR IN SAN FRANCISCO.\nAND THEN KATE STEINLE CASE, TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS.\nAT THE SAME TIME, OBVIOUSLY YOU WANT TO FOLLOW THE LAWS\nON THE BOOKS, BUT YOU HAVE TALKED ABOUT MASS\nDEPORTATION AND THEN ALSO YOU HAVE SAID THAT YOU HAVE\nHAD FAMILIES AND PEOPLE COME FORWARD TO YOU.\nWHAT ABOUT FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN HERE 11 OR 12\nYEARS THAT ARE ESTABLISHED IN THE COUNTRY?\nHOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THEM NOW?\n>> WELL, WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DOENED A, AGAIN, WE'RE GOING\nTO SECURE THE BORDER. ONCE THE BORDER IS SECURED\nAND WOE GET RID OF THE CRIMINAL ELEMENTS WHICH I'M\nGOING TO START BEFORE THE WALL OR START ANYTHING.\nWE WILL START THAT DAY ONE. WE WILL HOOK INTO VARIOUS\nSITUATIONS. BUT, AGAIN, PEOPLE ARE HERE\nILLEGALLY. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT\nTHEY ARE HERE ILLEGALLY. WE HAVE MANY PEOPLE,\nKIMBERLY, TRYING TO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY AND GOING\nTHROUGH A LEGAL PROCESS AND THEY ARE WAITING IN LINE TO\nCOME INTO OUR COUNTRY. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT WE\nHAVE A COUNTRY THAT'S BASED ON LAWS AND THE PEOPLE ARE\nHERE ILLEGALLY. SO WE WILL SEE WHAT WE WILL\nSEE. BUT WE'RE GOING TO START OFF\nBY SECURING THE BORDER, BY GETTING RID OF THE HORRIBLE\nCRIMINAL ELEMENT THAT'S CAUSING TREMENDOUS HAVOC,\nDRUG DEALERS, GANG MEMBERS, ET CETERA, AND I THINK\nPEOPLE WILL BE EXTREMELY HAPPY.\nAND I WILL BE ANNOUNCING SOMETHING WITHIN THE NEXT\nTWO WEEKS, A VERY COMPREHENSIVE PLAN ON\nIMMIGRATION. >> I'M SURE MANY PEOPLE WILL\nBE LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT\nABOUT YOUR CAMPAIGN. YOU HAD SOME RECENT CHANGES.\nYOU BROUGHT SOMEONE ON THAT I ADMIRE KELLYANNE CONWAY AS\nYOUR CAMPAIGN MANAGE TORE NOTE SPECIFICALLY, THAT'S\nTHE FIRST FEMALE CAMPAIGN MANAGER FOR A PRESIDENTIAL\nELECTION. SO, THAT IS SOMETHING THAT\nIS HISTORICALLY ESTABLISHING, YOU KNOW, A\nNEW FIRST. >> RIGHT.\n>> AND ALSO YOU BROUGHT ON BREITBART NEWS CHAIRMAN\nBANNON AS THE CEO, HOW DO YOU SEE THESE NEW HIRES AS\nIMPACTING YOUR CAMPAIGN. >> IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT.\nIT'S KNEW NEW THIS AND THEY JUST STARTED.\nTHEY WILL BE A GREAT EDITION.\nYOU SEE THE POLLS ARE GETTING VERY, VERY CLOSE.\nSOME OF THE INDIVIDUAL STATES ARE LITERALLY, I\nMEAN, WE'RE WINNING IN SOME OF THE PIG STATES, SO I\nTHINK YOU ARE PROBABLY SEEING THAT.\nI ASSUME YOU ARE REPORTING ON IT AT SOME POINT.\nYOU PROBABLY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.\nBUT WE HAVE BEEN DOING VERY WELL OVER THE LAST WEEK AND\nA HALF OR TWO WEEKS. >> THE POLLS SEEING A\nTIGHTENING IN THE POLLS AND SOME OF THE NUMBERS OF THE\nHISPANIC COMMUNITY AS WELL. SOME OF THOSE NUMBERS HAVE\nJUST COME OUT. THAT IS SIGNIFICANT.\nLET'S TALK ABOUT THIS. A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT KNOW\nYOU THAT HAVE KNOWN YOU FOR MANY, MANY YEARS TALK ABOUT,\nYOU KNOW, YOUR TEMPERAMENT, YOUR TONE.\nSOMEBODY THAT YOUR SON ERIC HAS CALLED YOU A HUMBLE MAN.\nPEOPLE THAT WORK FOR YOU LIKE YOU.\nBUT YOU HAVE ALSO SAID THAT YOU HAVE SOME REGRETS WHEN\nIT COMES TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE SAID\nDURING THIS CAMPAIGN. IS THERE ANYTHING\nSPECIFICALLY THAT YOU FEEL AT THIS POINT THAT YOU\nREGRET OR THAT YOU WANT TO REACH OUT TO DIFFERENT\nCOMMUNITIES OR PEOPLE? >> WELL, I JUST, YOU KNOW,\nWE ARE RUNNING A CAMPAIGN. I THINK WE ARE DOING A GOOD\nJOB. WE STARTED OFF WITH 17\nPEOPLE. WE ARE NOW DOWN TO ONE.\nI HAVE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE. I'M A BUSINESSMAN.\nI HAVE BUILT A GREAT BUSINESS, UNBELIEVABLE\nCOMPANY WITH SOME THE GREAT ASSETS OF THE WORLD.\nSOME THE GREAT REAL ESTATE ASSETS OF THE WORLD.\nI'M HAVING FUN DOING. THIS IT'S A MOVEMENT, AS YOU\nKNOW, WHEN WE OGO OUT AND SPEAK, WHEN WE HAVE EVENTS,\nWE GET NUMBERS THAT NOBODY HAS REALLY GOTTEN BEFORE.\nPROBABLY EVER. YOU KNOW, THEY TALK ABOUT IT\nAS THOUGH EVER. YOUR FRIEND BILL O'REILLY\nSAID THAT HE HAS NEVER SEEN, IT'S THE GREATEST POLITICAL\nPHENOMENA THAT HE HAS EVER SEEN.\nTHE RALLIES THAT WE HAVE ARE AMAZING.\nON TEMPERAMENT, I THINK TEMPERAMENT, AND A LOT OF\nPEOPLE HAVE SAID THAT THAT KNOW ME THAT MAYBE MY\nGREATEST STRENGTH IS MY TEMPERAMENT.\nMY TEMPERAMENT IS ONE THAT WINS.\nHILLARY CLINTON IS UNFIT TO BE PRESIDENT.\nYOU SEE THAT WITH ALL OF THE THINGS THAT SHE HAS DONE,\nALL OF THE LIES, ALL OF THE DECEPTION, THE EMAILS,\nTHE -- ALL OF THE TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE THINGS THAT SHE HAS\nDONE. SHE IS REAL WILL HE UNFIT TO\nBE PRESIDENT. I THINK AS FAR AS I'M\nCONCERNED, YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE A MADISON AVENUE TERM,\nBUT I THINK PROBABLY, MAYBE ONE OF MY GREATEST ASSETS IF\nNOT MY GREATEST ASSET, KIMBERLY IS TEMPERAMENT.\nI KNOW HOW TO WIN AND I HAVE A WINNING TEMPERAMENT.\nTHAT'S WHAT OUR COUNTRY NEEDS.\nWE DON'T WIN ANYMORE. WE ARE GOING TO START\nWINNING AGAIN. >> MR. TRUMP, THANK YOU SO\nMUCH FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT AND GOING \"ON THE RECORD.\"\n>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, KIMBERLY.\n>> AND JUST BEFORE, JOINING US RIGHT HERE, TRUMP SAT\nDOWN FOR A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER'S ROUND TABLE AT HIS\nLAS VEGAS HOTEL. AND IN A LITTLE BIT, TRUMP\nIS ATTENDING A NEVADA REPUBLICAN PARTY DINNER.\nFOX NEWS CAMPAIGN CARL CAMERON IS IN LAS VEGAS.\nCARL, SO THERE YOU GO. YOU ARE RIGHT WHERE THE\nACTION IS. >> HI, KIMBERLY.\nYEAH, I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, IT WAS HISPANIC LEADERS TOO\nAT THAT MEETING THIS AFTERNOON.\nAND TONIGHT HE WILL BE IN LAKE TAHOE FOR A MEETING\nWITH THE NEVADA REPUBLICAN PARTY.\nAND WE WERE TOLD TODAY THAT THAT WILL BE SOMETHING THAT\nCAMERAS WILL BE ALLOWED TO SHOOT.\nAND WE EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE SOME NEWS ON TRUMP'S\nECONOMIC AND JOBS PLAN TONIGHT.\nAND HE JUST MADE SOME NEWS WITH YOU IN THAT INTERVIEW\nSAYING THAT HE WAS GOING TO COME UP WITH QUOTE, A\nCOMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION PLAN SOMETIME IN THE NEXT\nCOUPLE OF WEEKS, INDEED, THAT HAS BEEN A BIG QUESTION\nIN THE LAST FEW DAYS. THERES WITH A PLANNED\nIMMIGRATION SPEECH THAT WAS SCHEDULED FOR YESTERDAY THAT\nWAS PUT OFF. IN PART BECAUSE OF THE\nCONTROVERSY OVER HIS REMARKS WITH SEAN HANNITY EARLIER IN\nTHE WEEK WHEN HE SAID THAT HE WOULD SOFTEN PART OF HIS\nPLAN TO DEPORT THE UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS, THE\nILLEGAL ALIENS WHO ARE IN THE COUNTRY NOW, SOMEWHERE\nNEAR 11 MILLION OF THEM. NOW, THAT CAUSED QUITE A\nFIRESTORM AND QUITE A BLOW BACK FROM CONSERVATIVES WHO\nTHOUGHT THAT WAS A FLIP FLOP.\nAND TRUMP HAS NOW REVERSED HIMSELF TO SAY THAT THERE\nWILL BE NO LEGALIZATION WHICH HE REPEATED IN YOUR\nINTERVIEW THERE. BUT THAT THAT RAISES A\nQUESTION. IF PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE LEGAL\nSTATUS, IF THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS HERE WANT TO BE\nL MR. TRUMP, THEY HAVE TO GO\nTO THEIR HOME COUNTRY AND COME BACK LAWFULLY.\nTHEN, THERE ARE THE BOTH HARDENED CRIMINALS WHO HE\nSAID ON DAY ONE HE WOULD START GOING AFTER TO DEPORT\nAND IT RAISES A QUESTION. WHAT OF THE I WILL ROLE\nIMMIGRANTS WHO ARE AFRAID TO COME FORWARD AND LEAVE THE\nCOUNTRY IN ORDER TO COME BACK WHO MAY DECIDE TO STAY\nHERE? AND IF THAT IS WHERE HE IS\nTALKING ABOUT SOFTENING THE RHETORIC, IS HE GOING TO RUN\nINTO PROBLEMS WITH FOLKS LIKE ANN COULTER AND SARAH\nPALIN AND OTHERS WHO DON'T WANT TO SEE A REPUBLICAN\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, A NOMINEE NOW, FLIP FLOPPING\nON IMMIGRATION POLICY, HAVING BEEN THROUGH YEARS\nAND YEARS OF FIGHTS OVER. THIS IN FACT, THE TERM\nCOMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM WAS WHAT THE MARCO\nRUBIO BILL WAS REFERRED TO AS, WHAT GEORGE W. BUSH WAS\nADVOCATING FOR AND WAY BACK IN 2008, FULLY EIGHT YEARS\nAGO WHAT JOHN MCCAIN WAS ADVOCATING FOR.\nAND, IT NEVER GOT PAST THE REPUBLICAN HOUSE\nCONSERVATIVES. IT DID GET THROUGH THE\nSENATE IN A COUPLE OF OCCASIONS BUT IT HADN'T\nGOTTEN ANY FURTHER THAN THAT SO IN TWO WEEKS, IF THAT'S\nWHEN MR. TRUMP IS GOING TO BE OUTLINING THAT, IT WILL\nCLARIFY WHAT HAS BEEN PERHAPS THE MOST PROVOCATIVE\nAND CONTROVERSIAL ASPECT OF THE ENTIRE DEBATE OTHER THAN\nTHE RACIAL BIGOTRY THAT BOTH CLINTON AND TRUMP ACCUSE ONE\nANOTHER OF. >> YOU HEARD IT RIGHT HERE.\nHE SAID GOING IT HAVE THAT COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION\nPLAN. SO THE SPECIFICS WILL BE\nTHERE FOR PEOPLE TO DECIDE AND THEN CAST THEIR VOTES\nAPPROPRIATELY. CARL, THANKS SO MUCH.\nSTAY COOL IN VEGAS. >> THANK YOU.\n>> THE PROTESTERS PROMINENT DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTER RIGHT\nOUTSIDE TRUMP TOWER. MARK BURNS GETTING INTO IT\nWITH A PERSON CLAIMING TO BE AN UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT.\nTAKE A LOOK. >> DO YOU SUPPORT A RACIST?\n>> DONALD TRUMP IS NOT A RACIST.\n>> SO YOU SUPPORT A RACIST. AND SO YOU WANT ME AND MY\nFAMILY TO GET DEPORTED? DO YOU WANT MY MOTHER AND MY\nLITTLE SISTER TO BE SEPARATED?\n>> JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE TALKING LOUDER THAN ME DON'T\nMAKE IT RIGHT. DON'T MAKE IT PROPER.\n>> I'M NOT ASKING. I'M ASKING A QUESTION.\n>> I'M NOT SAYING A STATEMENT.\n>> THERE HE IS. PROPER WAY.\n>> DO YOU WANT MY MOTHER AND MY FATHER TO BE DEPORTED?\n>> WHAT I'M SAYING IS. >> DO YOU WANT MY LITTLE\nSISTER TO BE SEPARATED FROM MY MOTHER.\n>> RACIST. FIRST OF ALL, HE IS NOT A\nRACIST. >> DO YOU WANT MY MOTHER AND\nMY FATHER TO BE DEPORTED. >> DO YOU WANT TO CONTINUE\nTO LIE AND RUIN CHARACTERISTICS OF A PERSON?\nANSWER THE QUESTION. >> ALL RIGHT.\nPASTOR BURNS, CAN I GET A WITNESS?\nYOU WERE IN TRUMP TOWER WITH A ROUND TABLE FOR MINORITY\nLEADERS AND YOU ARE THE CO-FOUNDER AND CEO OF NOW\nTELEVISION NETWORK. YOU JOIN US.\nWOW, THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE SITUATION THERE.\nHOW DID YOU FEEL BECAUSE YOU WERE TRYING TO SPEAK AND THE\nMAN WAS NOT LISTENING. HE WAS SHOUTING QUESTIONS.\nYOU WERE TRYING TO DEFEND SOMEONE THAT YOU SUPPORT,\nCORRECT? >> SURE, ABSOLUTELY.\n>> MR. TRUMP TO SAY THAT HE IS NOT A RACIST.\n>> AGAIN, IT HAPPENED SO QUICKLY.\nI REALLY -- I ACTUALLY BROUGHT THE GENTLEMAN ALONG\nBECAUSE I WANTED TO HEAR HIS CONCERNS.\n>> SURE. >> THINKING WE WOULD HAVE A\nLOGICAL, INTELLIGENT CONVERSATION.\nAND THEN OBVIOUSLY HE BEGINS PERSISTING TO YELL AND NOT\nREALLY HEAR. AND I THINK SOME PEOPLE\nTHINK THAT THE LOUDER THEY TALK, YOU KNOW, THAT MAKES\nTHEM MORE CONVINCING. AND RIGHT AND ACCURATE.\nAND FOR ME THAT REALLY JUST HAD ENOUGH OF HIM YELLING\nAND SCREAMING INCORRECT INFORMATION.\nDONALD TRUMP BEING A RACIST. DONALD TRUMP BEING A RACIST.\nYOU KNOW, THE MOMENT HE BEGAN THE CONVERSATION WITH\nINCORRECT INFORMATION, THE CONVERSATION BECAME INVALID\nSO THEREFORE THERE WAS NO NEED TO CONTINUE THE\nCONVERSATION. >> YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU TAKE A\nLOOK AT THAT IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF SNAPSHOT OF SOME OF\nTHE INSTRUMENTAL, THE STRIFE AND SOME OF THE VITRIOL CAN\nYOU SEE BACK AND FORTH ON BOTH SIDES FOR THOSE THAT\nSUPPORT DONALD TRUMP AND THOSE THAT SUPPORT HILLARY\nCLINTON. SOME OF THE THINGS WE HAVE\nBEEN SEEING. YOU KNOW, COMMUNITIES THAT\nARE STRUGGLING, SOME OF THE PROTESTS COMING FORTH FROM\nBLACK LIVES MATTER. YOU KNOW, AS A PLAQUEMINES\nIN THIS COUNTRY, ONE THAT SUPPORTS TRUMP, WHAT IS THE\nSOLUTION? HOW DO YOU BRING PEOPLE\nTOGETHER WHEN THEY WON'T EVEN LISTEN TO ONE ANOTHER?\n>> THE BIGGEST THING HAS GOT TO START WITH THE\nLEADERSHIP. OUR CURRENT PRESIDENT BARACK\nOBAMA, I THINK AS INFAMOUSLY KNOWN AS DIVIDER IN CHIEF.\nHE REALLY HAD AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME A\nINTERNATIONAL VOICE OF UNIFICATION.\nBRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER. BUT HE HAS CHOSE IN CERTAIN\nCASES TO BE REALLY ONE-SIDED INSTEAD OF BEING THE UNION\nUNIFIRETO BRING OUR COUNTRY TOGETHER.\nWHAT YOU ARE SEEING RIGHT NOW IS NOT CAUSED BY BARACK\nOBAMA. SURE NOT CAUSED BY DONALD\nTRUMP. IT IS, YOU KNOW, YEARS OF\nFRUSTRATION BETWEEN THE RACES BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY IS\nALMOST BUILT ON RACIAL TENSION.\nBUT, IT'S GOT TO FIRST START WITH THE LEADERS.\nWE HAVE GOT TO FIRST GET RID OF THE ADJECTIVES THAT\nDESCRIBE US. WE HAVE GOT TO STOP BEING\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN OR HISPANIC AMERICAN.\nWE HAVE GOT TO JUST START SEEING OURSELVES JUST AS\nAMERICANS. AND THE MOMENT WE STOP\nFOCUSING ON THOSE COLORS THAT REALLY DIVIDE US, THEN\nWE CAN REALLY BEGIN TO START FOCUSING ON THE COLORS THAT\nUNITE US. THAT'S THE VISION OF\nDR. KING. >> SO, LET ME ASK YOU THIS,\nSO OBVIOUSLY YOU SUPPORT MR. TRUMP AND YOU MENTIONED\nHERE THE VISION OF DR. KING. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THESE\nCOMMUNITIES, MINORITY COMMUNITIES THAT ARE\nSTRUGGLING AND LOOKING FOR JOBS AND GOOD SCHOOLS AND\nCHOICES FOR SCHOOLS AND EDUCATION.\nWHY WOULD THEY CHOOSE MR. TRUMP.\n>> IN MATH AFRICAN-AMERICANS HAVE BEEN VOTING DEMOCRAT\nFOR OVER 50 YEARS. THAT IS FACTS.\nAND IN THE 50 YEARS THAT WE HAVE BEEN VOTING DEMOCRAT,\nWHAT DO WE HAVE TO SHOW FOR IT?\nI THINK OUR EDUCATIONAL -- THOSE IN AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nCOMMUNITIES ARE STILL AT WHAT I CALL THE BOTTOM OF\nTHE TOTEM POLE. WE ARE NOT AT THE LEVEL WE\nNEED TO BE. IF YOU ARE NOT UNDERSTANDING\nYOUR FRUSTRATIONS AND YOU REALLY WANT TO SEE CHANGE,\nWE CAN'T KEEP MAKING THOSE SAME DECISIONS EXPECTING A\nDIFFERENT RESULT TO TAKE PLACE.\nDONALD TRUMP WANTS TO MAKE SURE.\n>> RIGHT. >> THAT WE EMPOWER OUR LOCAL\nBUSINESSES SO WE CAN TRULY BRING JOBS BACK TO OUR\nCOUNTRY. >> YOU ARE SAYING TO THOSE\nCOMMUNITIES A MEANING OF OUTREACH TAKE A CHANCE ON\nTHEM. WHAT DO THEY HAVE TO LOSE.\n>> ABSOLUTELY.",

IT WAS CLOSED TO THE PRESS.\nMOST EXPERTS LISTENING TO TRUMP OVER RECENT DAYS BELIEVE HE'S\nBETTING THAT CHANGING HIS STANCE ON IMMIGRATION OR THE WAY HE\nTALKS ABOUT IT WILL GET HIM NEW VOTES FROM LATINOS, WHILE NOT\nALIENATING THE BASE THAT GAVE HIM THE NOMINATION.\nIT IS A BIG GAMBLE. CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT,\nCARL CAMERON, WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IN LAS VEGAS.\n>> Reporter: IN NEVADA, A STATE WITH A LARGE LATINO POPULATION,\nDONALD TRUMP ALLOWED CAMERAS ONLY FOR A MOMENT BEFORE\nSPEAKING PRIVATELY WITH HISPANIC LEADERS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS.\n>> WE'VE BEEN DOING VERY, VERY WELL WITH THE LATINOS.\n>> Reporter: HIS STUNNING REVERSAL THIS WEEK IN WHICH HE\nSAID HE MIGHT NOT DEPORT ALL 11 MILLION IMMIGRANTS IN THE U.S.\nWAS WELCOME NEWS FOR MOST LATINO LEADERS.\nBUT AFTER PROMISING TO DEPORT ALL ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FOR MORE\nTHAN A YEAR AND POUNDING HIS FORMER RIVALS AS A WEEK FOR THAT\nPOSITION, HE FACED A BACKLASH FROM CONSERVATIVE WHITE\nSUPPORTERS, INCLUDING WOMEN. >> ARE YOU READY TO MAKE AMERICA\nGREAT AGAIN! >> Reporter: SARAH PALIN WHO\nCAMPAIGNED FOR AND WHEN TRUMP SEVERAL TIMES THIS YEAR SAID IF\nMR. TRUMP WERE TO GO DOWN A PATH OF WISHY-WASHY POSITIONS, THERE\nWOULD BE MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT. ANN COULTER WROTE PLAINLY,\nTHERE'S NOTHING TRUMP CAN DO THAT WON'T BE FORGIVEN, EXCEPT\nCHANGE HIS IMMIGRATION POLICIES. COULTER SAID TRUMP HAD SAID\nSOMETHING STUPID, AND WOULD DO SO AGAIN, BUT WAS NOT BACKING\nDOWN FROM MASS DEPORTATIONS. TRUMP SAID AGAIN THIS WEEK THAT\nHE WOULD BUILD A BORDER WALL AND MAKE MEXICO PAY FOR IT, WHICH\nMEXICO DIES, AND DEPORT VIOLENT AND CAREER CRIMINALS, BUT\nSUGGESTED OTHERWISE LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO\nSTAY. AND LAST NIGHT HE REVERSED\nHIMSELF AGAIN, RETURNING TO HIS DEMAND THAT ILLEGAL ALIENS FIRST\nGO HOME AND THEN CAN RETURN TO THE U.S. LEGALLY.\n>> WELL, WHEN THEY COME BACK, THEN THEY CAN START PAYING\nTAXES. >> SO THEY STILL HAVE TO LEAVE?\n>> THERE IS NO PATH TO LEGALIZATION UNLESS THEY LEAVE\nTHE COUNTRY AND COME BACK. >> Reporter: TRUMP'S\nNAME-CALLING BATTLE WITH HILLARY CLINTON HAS ESCALATED TO A LEVEL\nNOT SEEN IN PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS SINCE THE PRE-CIVIL\nRIGHTS ERA. >> HILLARY CLINTON IS A BIGOT!\nWHO SEES PEOPLE OF COLOR -- ONLY AS VOTES.\n>> THERE HAS BEEN A STEADY STREAM OF BIGOTRY COMING FROM\nHIM. THIS IS SOMEONE WHO RE-TWEETS\nWHITE SUPREMACISTS ONLINE. >> Reporter: ASKED IN NEW\nHAMPSHIRE IF HE WANTS THE SUPPORT OF WHITE SUPREMACIST\nVOTERS, TRUMP SAID NO AND QUICKLY CHANGED THE SUBJECT.\nQUOTE, I DON'T AT ALL. NOT AT ALL.\nAND I WILL TELL YOU, THERE IS NOT ABOUT HATE, THIS IS ABOUT\nLOVE. >> TRUMP'S STATEMENT EARLIER\nTHIS WEEK THAT HE WOULD SOFTEN HIS DEPORTATION RHETORIC COUPLED\nWITH HIS STATEMENT LAST NIGHT WITH THAT THOSE WHO WANT LEGAL\nSTATUS WOULD HAVE TO GO HOME TO THEIR HOME COUNTRY AND THEN COME\nBACK LEGALLY, ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE AND THEY LEAVE OPEN A\nBIG QUESTION. WHAT WOULD HE DO WITH THOSE\nUNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS IN THE COUNTRY NOW, WHO DON'T CARE\nABOUT LEGAL STATUS, AND DON'T COME OUT OF THE SHADOWS?\nBRET? >> YOU KNOW, CARL, WE'RE GETTING\nINTO THE FINAL STRETCH IN THIS CAMPAIGN.\nOPERATIVES SOMETIMES DUMP OPPOSITION FILES ON OPPOSING\nCANDIDATES AND STAFF TO REPORTERS.\nWHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THIS REPORT THAT TRUMP'S NEW CAMPAIGN\nCEO HAD A VIOLENT EPISODE WITH HIS WIFE YEARS AGO?\n>> WELL, IT WAS IN 1996, IT WAS QUITE SOME TIME AGO, AND IT\nNEVER GOT INTO THE LEGAL PROCESS, BUT THE POLICE WERE\nCALLED TO THEIR -- HIS HOME, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT STEVE\nBANNON, AND THERE HAD APPARENTLY BEEN AN ARGUMENT WITH HIS WIFE\nAND HIS WIFE THREATENED TO CALL POLICE, AND ACCORDING TO POLICE\nRECORDS, HE TOOK THE PHONE AND SMASHED IT.\nTHE POLICE HAD RECORDED THIS. HOWEVER, WHEN IT CAME TIME TO GO\nTO COURT, HIS WIFE NEVER SHOWED UP, SO THE CHARGES WERE DROPPED.\nSO WE DON'T KNOW, BUT THIS IS THE KIND OF STUFF THAT IS\nBROUGHT UP IN EVERY FOUR-YEAR PRESIDENTIAL CYCLE TO GO AFTER\nTHE CANDIDATE BY GOING AFTER STAFF.\n>> BUT WE DON'T KNOW IF MR.
