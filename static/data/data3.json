HUNDREDS MORE INJURED AND AN\nUNKNOWN NUMBER STILL TRAPPED IN THE RUBBLE.\nRIGHT NOW THOUSANDS OF RESCUERS ARE ON THE SCENES USING HEAVY\nEQUIPMENT, SEARCH DOGS AND EVEN THEIR BARE HANDS TO TRY TO\nLOCATE SURVIVORS. JOINING US NOW FROM AMATRICE,\nITALY, BILL NEELY. BILL?\n>> GOOD MORNING, MIKA. THERE IS DESTRUCTION, TERRIBLE\nDESTRUCTION ALL AROUND ME JUST LIKE THIS.\nIT'S HARD TO SEE HOW ANYONE COULD HAVE COME OUT OF A\nBUILDING LIKE THAT. WHAT IS THAT?\nMAYBE THREE STORIES HIGH. IT IS ACTUALLY HARD TO TELL.\nJUST A SHORT TIME AGO, THERE WAS A RESCUER WITH A SNIFFER DOG,\nONCE AGAIN, JUST MAKING SURE THERE WAS NO ONE IN THERE ALIVE.\nWE DON'T THINK THERE IS. THERE ARE, AS YOU SAY, THOUSANDS\nOF RESCUERS HERE FROM THE FIRE SERVICE, SOLDIERS, POLICE.\nALL OF THEM WORKING, ESPECIALLY HERE IN AMATRICE THE HARDEST HIT\nTOWN HOPING. AMID ALL THE DEATH AND\nDESTRUCTION HERE, THERE ARE MOMENTS OF HOPE AND MOMENTS OF\nJOY. FROM THE RUBBLE, A SMALL VOICE.\nRESCUERS FIND A LITTLE GIRL TRAPPED IN THE RUINS.\nCOME ON, JULIA, THEY URGE HER. AND THEN PULL HER OUT.\nJULIA IS BEWILDERED, BUT ALIVE. CLINGING TO HER RESCUER.\nAMAZINGLY, UNINJURED. BEAUTIFUL GIRL, THEY SHOUT.\nNEARBY, A LITTLE BOY IS CARRIED AWAY AFTER 12 HOURS BURIED IN A\nCOLLAPSED HOUSE. LIFE AMID SO MUCH DEATH IN THE\nBROKEN TOWN OF AMATRICE THAT WOKE THIS MORNING TO AFTERSHOCKS\nAND A RISING DEATH TOLL. FROM A MASSIVE QUAKE THAT STRUCK\nTUESDAY AS EVERYONE SLEPT. ITS CLOCK STOPPED.\nTHEY WORKED OVERNIGHT TO PULL PEOPLE OUT, MOSTLY JUST BODIES.\nAN 80-YEAR-OLD WOMAN HER DAUGHTER KILLED AND A RESCUER\nTELLING HER TO STAY CALM. AMATRICE WAS HARDEST HIT.\nREDUCED TO DUST BY A QUAKE FELT 100 MILES AWAY IN ROME.\n>> THERE'S NOTHING THERE ANY MORE.\n>> ANOTHER SURVIVOR IS AIRLIFTED OUT SWAYING ABOVE A TOWN THAT IS\nSHAKING STILL. THEY ARE GOING THROUGH THE\nRUBBLE HERE BY HAND TRYING TO MATCH THE BODIES THEY FOUND WITH\nTHE POSSESSIONS HERE TO MORE EASILY IDENTIFY THEM.\nBUT MOSTLY THEY'RE USING THESE EARTH MOVERS.\nIT IS NOW THE CASE HERE. MORE OF A RECOVERY THAN A\nRESCUE. THIS WAS AMATRICE BEFORE AND NOW\nAFTER. A HISTORIC TOWN AND NOW EVERY\nBUILDING CRACKED OR DESTROYED. MANY SLEPT OUTSIDE OVERNIGHT\nFEARING MORE BUILDINGS WOULD COLLAPSE.\nIT'S A SMALL PLACE WHERE EVERYONE KNOWS EVERYONE.\nAND WHERE THEY ALL KNOW THE DEATH TOLL WILL RISE, AGAIN.\nWELL, THE RESCUERS HERE ADMIT THEY DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW HOW\nMANY PEOPLE ARE MISSING IN BUILDINGS LIKE THIS ONE.\nTHIS WAS A HISTORIC, BUT ALSO A TOURIST TOWN AND HUNDREDS OF\nTOURISTS HERE, AS WELL, AS THE LOCAL'S ONE HOTEL HAS COLLAPSED\nENTIRELY. SO, THEY'RE REALLY NOT SURE HOW\nHIGH THE DEATH TOLL WILL BE. THEY'RE WORKING AMID\nAFTERSHOCKS. MORE THAN 400 SO FAR, INCLUDING\nONE THIS MORNING THAT WAS 4.7 ON THE RICHTER SCALE.\nTHAT'S PRETTY STRONG. THAT'S CERTAINLY STRONG ENOUGH\nTO BRING DOWN FRAGILE BUILDINGS. SO, THERE IS STILL A BIG RISK\nHERE. ONE OTHER THING.\nTHE TWO OTHER EARTHQUAKES IN THIS AREA.\nTHE TWO RECENT TREMORS. THE STRONGEST EARTHQUAKE IN THE\nSEQUENCE WASN'T THE FIRST ONE. SO, THERE IS STILL GREAT RISK\nHERE OF NOT JUST AN AFTERSHOCK BUT, EFFECTIVELY, ANOTHER\nEARTHQUAKE. MIKA?\n>> NBC BILL NEELY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nWE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE \"MORNING JOE.\"",

AT LEAST 73 PEOPLE ARE DEAD.\nMORE VICTIMS ARE STILL TRAPPED IN THE RUBBLE.\nYOU'RE JUST HEARING ONE RESCUER ASKING AN INJURED WOMAN IF SHE\nCOULD BREATHE AND TELLING HER TO STAY CALM.\nNBC NEWS CHIEF GLOBAL CORRESPONDENT BILL NEILY NOW\nJOINING ME. OH MY GOD, JUST LOOKING AT THE\nSCENE BEHIND YOU. WE ALL KNOW THOSE BEAUTIFUL HILL\nTOWNS, TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE FINDING THERE.\n>> Reporter: AND THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL IN ITALY,\nWELL, WHAT YOU CAN SEE BEHIND ME WAS A THREE-STORY BUILDING, BUT\nWHAT YOU'LL ALSO SEE IS HARDLY ANY SIGN OF HUMANITY.\nNOT JUST HUMAN BEINGS, BUT ANYTHING THAT LOOKS LIKE A BED,\nA TABLE, IT'S JUST BURIED UNDER THESE HUGE SLABS OF CONCRETE\nTHAT CAME DOWN AT 20 TO 4:00 IN THE MORNING HERE WHEN EVERYONE,\n2,700 PEOPLE, AT LEAST, IN THIS TOWN, WERE SLEEPING.\nTHERE COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN A WORSE TIME.\nTHERE WEREN'T PEOPLE OUT ON THE STREETS.\nONE OF THREE TOWNS BADLY HIT BY THIS EARTHQUAKE, BUT THIS ONE IS\nWHAT YOU MIGHT CALL ALMOST LITERALLY THE DEAD CENTER OF THE\nEARTHQUAKE. AS YOU SAY, 73 PEOPLE NOW\nCONFIRMED DEAD. MOST OF THEM HERE IN THE AREA IN\nTHE LAST HALF AN HOUR, I'VE SEEN -- WELL, ONE BODY BEING\nBROUGHT INTO AN AREA WHERE THERE ARE 14 OTHER 15 BODIES LAID OUT\nUNDER BLANKETS AND SHEETS. THIS TOWN IS BROKEN, PHYSICALLY,\nIT'S BROKEN SPIRITUALLY AS WELL BECAUSE THERE ARE LOTS OF PEOPLE\nWALKING AROUND HERE IN TEARS OF DEEP, DEEP EMOTION.\nWE'VE GOT RESCUE WORKERS, I THINK, SOME OF THE RESCUE WORK\nIS FINISHED FOR THE DADDY. THERE ARE MEN COMES TOWARDS ME,\nABSOLUTELY WEARY FROM 12 HOURS OF DIGGING IN THE RUBBLE.\nSOMETIMES WITH THEIR BARE HANDS. ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE TO\nARRIVE WAS A PRIEST WHO ARRIVED AT DAWN, AND AT A HORRIFIC\nDESCRIPTION OF PEOPLE SCREAMING IN THE RUBBLE AND HIM GOING\nAROUND GIVING THE LAST RIGHTS TO CHILDREN.\nSO THIS WAS ONE OF ITALY'S -- MAN OVER THERE JUST SHAKING HIS\nHEAD IN DISBELIEF. THIS WAS ONE OF THE ITALY'S\nTOURIST CENTERS, AND NOW IT IS AT THE CENTER OF THE WORST\nEARTHQUAKE TO HIT ITALY IN A DECADE.\nANDREA. >> AND BILL, HELP SITUATE US,\nHOW FAR ARE YOU? HOW MANY MILES OR KILOMETERS\nFROM ROME. WHAT REGION EXACTLY ARE YOU IN?\n>> Reporter: SO THIS IS THE CENTRAL BELT OF ITALY.\nIT'S ABOUT, YOU KNOW, 18 MILES EAST OF ROME, BUT ON THE ROADS\nHERE, THESE ARE MOUNTAINOUS AREAS.\nIT TAKES A LONG TIME. THAT'S WHY THERE ARE HELICOPTERS\nIN THE AIR RIGHT NOW BECAUSE MANY OF THE ROADS ARE\nINACCESSIBLE. IT IS ALSO THESE THREE TOWNS ARE\nALSO ON A FAULT LINE. THESE TOWNS ARE CAUGHT BETWEEN\nTWO CITIES WHERE THERE'VE BEEN TWO EARTHQUAKES IN THE LAST 20\nYEARS. DEVASTATING EARTHQUAKES.\nONE IN PARTICULAR KILLED MORE THAN 300 PEOPLE.\nSO PEOPLE HERE HAVE BEEN USED TO THE THREAT OF EARTHQUAKES, BUT\nHISTORICALLY, THEY HAVEN'T BEEN HIT, AND THIS TIME, BADLY UNTIL\nTODAY. AS I SAID, 20 TO 4:00 IN THE\nMORNING, IT COULD HARDLY HAVE HAPPENED A THE A WORSE TIME.\nTHE POPE WHO WAS DUE TO HAVE A SET OF PRAYERS TODAY POSTPONED\nTHEM AND PRAYED INSTEAD FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS TOWN.\nHE CALLED IN THE MAYOR WHO SAID THERE IS ALMOST NOTHING LEFT OF\nTHE TOWN AND THERE ARE LOTS OF DEAD CHILDREN IN THIS TOWN.\nSO THE POPE SPECIFICALLY PICKED OUT THOSE COMMENTS AND PRAYED\nFOR THE TOWN TODAY. ABOUT 100 YARDS UP THE ROAD FROM\nWHERE I'M STANDING, ANDREA, IS THE MAIN DRAG, THE MAIN STREET,\nWHICH IS UTTERLY DEVASTATED. THERE ISN'T A SINGLE BUILDING\nTHERE WHICH HASN'T BEEN HIT. YOU CAN SEE BEDS, PERLIOUSLY\nHANGING OUT OF ROOMS. IT'S MIRACULOUS MORE DIDN'T DIE.\nJUST UP THE ROAD, THEY ARE DIGGING IN ONE AREA WHERE THEY\nTHINK THERE ARE PEOPLE DEAD. SO THIS DEATH TOLL WILL RISE.\n>> JUST EXTRAORDINARY DEVASTATION, BILL, THANK YOU.\nTHANKS VERY MUCH FOR THAT",

WHILE THE DEATH TOLL WAS\nCONFIRMED AT 38, WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE TO YOU?\n>> I CAN TELL YOU THE RESCUE EFFORT IS STILL ONGOING.\nMOMENTS BEFORE WE HIT LIVE HERE, ONE OF THE RESCUE OFFICIALS\nCONFIRMED TO US THERE HAVE BEEN 50 DEATHS IN AMATRICE ALONE.\nTHIS IS A MUCH MORE POWERFUL QUAKE THAN WE THOUGHT.\nFROM WHERE I'M STANDING I CAN SEE DOZENS OF BUILDINGS\nEFFECTIVELY FLATTENED. RESCUE WORKERS HAVE BEEN RACING\nACROSS THE CLOCK TO PULL BODIES FROM THE SCENE.\nTHEY HAVE BEEN WALKING AROUND WITH RESCUE DOGS WHOSE JOB IT IS\nTO CRAWL INTO THAT RUBBLE TO TRY TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE ALIVE\nTRAPPED UNDERNEATH. WE'VE SEEN LOTS OF SECURITY\nSERVICES, FIREFIGHTERS, ALL SORTS OF VOLUNTEERS TRYING TO\nCOME HERE TO RESCUE THOSE WHO ARE STILL TRAPPED.\nORDINARY CITIZENS WERE USING THEIR BARE HANDS TO TRY TO PULL\nPEOPLE FROM THE GROUNDS. AMATRICE IS ONE OF THE\nEPICENTERS OF THIS QUAKE. IT WAS SO POWERFUL THAT I FELT\nTHE SHOCK WAVES 100 MILES AWAY IN ROME.\nIT WOKE ME UP AT 3:30 A.M. LOCAL TIME.\nPEOPLE WERE IN BED. THERE WAS NO TIME TO PREPARE, NO\nTIME TO ESCAPE. THIS IS A WELL VISITED TOURIST\nAREA. THERE WAS A LOT OF ELDERLY\nPEOPLE RESIDING IN THIS TOWN. IN THE SUMMER TIME, THERE WOULD\nHAVE BEEN LOTS OF TOURISTS HERE. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY\nDIFFICULT FOR THOSE PEOPLE TO LEAVE.\nTHIS WAS A TOWN THAT HAS WITH STOOD THE TEST OF TIME FOR\nCENTURIES. AS THE MAYOR SAID THIS MORNING,\nTHERE IS ALMOST NOTHING LEFT. SOME BUILDINGS ARE STANDING.\nA LOT OF THEM DO NOT LOOK STRUCTURALLY SOUND.\nA LOT OF THEM SIMPLY FLATTENED. THERE ARE CRACKS IN THE GROUND.\nWE'VE BEEN FEELING THE AFTERSHOCKS.\nALMOST EVERY HOUR THERE'S BEEN SOME SORT OF AFTERSHOCK.\nIT'S A VERY TERRIFYING EXPERIENCE.\nYOU DON'T KNOW WHICH BUILDINGS WILL CONTINUE TO STAND AND WHICH\nMIGHT COLLAPSE. >> TALK TO US MORE ABOUT THE\nPEOPLE OF AMATRICE. AS YOU SAID, MANY OF THESE\nBUILDINGS ARE CENTURIES OLD. SOME LOCALS HAVE BEEN THERE FOR\nGENERATIONS. HOW ARE THE SURVIVORS COPING AS\nTHEY'RE LOOKING AT THEIR SMALL VILLAGE WIPED OUT?\n>> THERE'S A HOSPITAL THAT'S STILL STANDING BUT A LITTLE BIT\nDESTROYED. CHUNKS OF IT WERE MISSING FROM\nTHE WALL. WE SAW RESIDENTS DAZED, SHOCKED,\nCONFUSED SITTING OUTSIDE. THE DOCTORS THERE TOLD US THAT\nTHE PEOPLE WITH THE WORST INJURIES WERE EVACUATED TO\nLARGER HOSPITALS. BUT THOSE IN SHOCK OR WITH\nSMALLER WOUNDS WERE STAYING OUT THERE.\nTHEY PULLED THE BEDS OUTSIDE TO KEEP THEM SAFER AND WERE\nTREATING PEOPLE THERE, DOING TRIAGE, GIVING THEM FOOD AND\nWATER. ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES IS WHERE\nIS THESE PEOPLE GOING TO GO? THERE MAY BE MORE CASUALTIES,\nMORE HOMES DESTROYED. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO\nNEED TEMPORARY HOUSING, TEMPORARY SHELTER.\nANOTHER THING WE'RE HEARING FROM OFFICIALS IS THEY'RE DESPERATE\nFOR ADDITIONAL DONATIONS OF RESCUE EQUIPMENT, BLOOD\nDONATIONS AND BASIC NECESSITIES, FOOD, WATER, MEDICINE, DIAPERS.\nLAST TIME WE SAW SUCH A DEVASTAING EARTHQUAKE WAS IN\n2009. AROUND 300 PEOPLE WERE KILLED\nTHERE. THAT CITY IS STILL A GHOST TOWN\nEIGHT YEARS LATER. WHAT THIS IS GOING TO DO TO\nAMATRICE AND THE SURROUNDING TOWNS REMAINS TO BE SEEN, BUT\nTHE PEOPLE HERE ARE ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATED.\n>> IS IT SAFE FOR LOCALS WHO ARE THERE TO ACTUALLY STAY NEARBY\nSINCE AFTERSHOCKS COULD CONTINUE?\n>> IT'S NOT AND THEY'VE BEEN PUSHING BOTH THE LOCALS AND US,\nTHE MEDIA, FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY BECAUSE OF THESE\nAFTERSHOCKS. OF COURSE THE BRAVE RESCUE\nWORKERS ARE STILL GOING TO THE SCENE TRYING TO PULL OUT ANYONE\nLEFT IN THE RUBBLE. IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO TELL\nHOW LONG THAT MIGHT CONTINUE. THIS WAS A SHALLOWER EARTHQUAKE.\nWHILE I'M NO EXPERT IN THE GEOLOGY, WHEN THEY'RE SHALLOWER,\nIT TENDS TO BRING MORE BUILDINGS DOWN.\nTHEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE ACTUAL\nRESIDENTIAL AREAS. OBVIOUSLY RESCUE WORKERS STILL\nNEED TO RISK THEIR LIVES TO GO IN THERE BECAUSE THERE ARE STILL\nPEOPLE TRAPPED. AMATRICE IS ON TOP OF A HILL AND\nTHERE ARE LOTS OF REMOTE SMALLER AREAS THAT RESCUE WORKERS HAVE\nNOT BEEN ABLE TO FULLY GET TO. THE DEATH TOLL MIGHT RISE.\nTHERE'S A LOT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE FULL SCALE OF THE\nDESTRUCTION HERE IN CENTRAL ITALY.\n>> PLEASE STAY SAFE. I WANT TO STAY ON THIS BUT GO TO\nCAL PERRY. CAL, HERE YOU ARE WITH THE MAP.\nHELP US UNDERSTAND HOW BIG THE IMPACT OF THIS EARTHQUAKE IS.\n>> IT WAS VERY LARGE. IT HAPPENED AT THE WORST\nPOSSIBLE TIME. AS LUCY SAID, IT WAS SHALLOW.\nA SHALLOW EARTHQUAKE, THERE'S NOWHERE FOR THE ENERGY TO GO.\nTHOSE DEEPER EARTHQUAKES, THE EARTH HAS MORE TIME AND SPACE TO\nABSORB THE DAMAGE. WE'RE REALLY FOCUSING NOW ON THE\nTOWN OF AMATRICE. THE HOSPITAL THERE IS SORT OF\nHALF RUBBLE AT THIS POINT, WHICH IS A HUGE PROBLEM.\nAS THEY'RE PULLING PEOPLE OUT OF THESE BUILDINGS, THEY HAVE\nNOWHERE TO TAKE THEM. THERE'S AT LEAST 17 DEAD IN\nAMAT, RICE.  USGS HAS PUT OUT, THESE ARE THE\nRINGS OF DAMAGE. LUCY SAID SHE FELT IT AS FAR AS\nROME. PEOPLE IN CROATIA FELT IT.\nTHAT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF THE SCOPE, HOW POWERFUL THIS\nEARTHQUAKE IS. THE CONCERN ABOUT THE\nAFTERSHOCKS ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE RESCUE WORKERS.\nHERE IS THAT 2009 QUAKE. THIS IS THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE\nALPS. THIS IS WHY PEOPLE GO ON\nVACATION HERE. IT'S ABOUT 15 DEGREES COOLER\nTHAN IT IS IN ROME. 55,000 HOMES WERE DESTROYED IN\nTHIS EARTHQUAKE IN 2009. >> AS LUCY SAID, WE COULD SEE\nMORE WITH THE AFTERSHOCKS. AGAIN, THIS COMMUNITY, MANY OF\nTHESE BUILDINGS DATE BACK TO THE 15th CENTURY.\nI DON'T LIKE REPORTING THIS NEW INFORMATION.\nTHE DEATH TOLL HAS RISEN OFFICIALLY TO 50 AND THOSE\nRESCUES STILL CONTINUE. IN AMATRICE ALONE, 50.\nAND THERE ARE AREAS THAT THE RESCUE WORKERS HAVE NOT EVEN\nBEEN ABLE TO MAKE THEIR WAY TO",

SO THIS PART OF ITALY, QUITE\nOFTEN STRUCK BY QUAKES, MAYBE YOU REMEMBER IN 2009, THIS GREAT\nCITY IF CENTRAL ITALY WAS HIT BY A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE.\nSO IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE ALWAYS BE READY TO AND PREPARE\nFOR CERTAIN SITUATIONS. >> IF THE DEATH TOLL IS AT 73\nAND INJURED AT 100, THAT IS EXPECTED TO RISE.\nIS THERE A SENSE OF HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE MISSING?\nHAVE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND BEEN ABLE TO TABULATE AND SEE PEOPLE\nNOT ACCOUNTED FOR? >> IT IS SUMMER SO HOLIDAY\nSEASON.

WERE VISITING THEIR FAMILIES.\nSO THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT NUMBERS MIGHT INCREASE BUT IT IS\nTOO SOON FOR THAT NUMBER. >> DOES ITALY NEED HELP FROM\nOTHER COUNTRIES? >> YOU KNOW, SINCE THIS MORNING\nALL OUR MAJOR PARTNERS AND ALLIES HAVE COME UP AND GIVEN\nTHEIR SUPPORT. FIRST AND FOREMOST, PRESIDENT\nOBAMA CALLED THIS MORNING. SECRETARY KERRY HAD A VERY WARM\nPHONE CALL.

SO FOR THE TIME BEING IT IS\nIMPORTANT TO ASSESS THE SITUATION AND BEFORE THE NIGHT\nCOMES, HAVING ALL THE TEAMS ON THE GROUND.\n>> YOU MENTIONED THAT EARTHQUAKE IN 2 IT 009, LOOKING AT THIS ONE\nWE CAN SEE IN THE PICTURES JUST THESE BUILDINGS THAT HAVE\nCOLLAPSED. WE TALKED ABOUT THE MAYOR WHO\nSAID THIS TOWN IS NO MORE. ENTIRE WALLS JUST SHEARED OFF\nAND BUILDINGS THAT HAVE COME DOWN.\nTHERE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A LACK OF CERTAINLY BUILD WILLING\nPREPARATION.

SO THIS IMPORTANT BUT ALSO WHEN\nIT COMES TO REBUILDING AND RECONSTRUCTING THE CITY IT IS\nIMPORTANT THAT LOCAL COMMUNITIES REMAIN THERE BECAUSE THERE IS A\nSENSE OF ATTACHMENT, A SENSE OF STRONG BONES, AND CONNECTING\nLOCAL PEOPLE, LOCAL PUBLIC RELATION TO THEIR REGIONS.\n>> THE POPE IS SENDING ASSISTANCE.\nTHAT'S WHAT WE HAVE HEARD.

THAT IS A WOMAN, A WOMAN,\nBENEATH CHUNKS OF CONCRETE. THE ONLY THING YOU CAN SEE ON\nTHE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCREEN IS HER HAND.\nTHE ONLY THING COMING OUT OF THAT CONCRETE, MAN AT HER SIDE\nCOMFORTING HER UNTIL HELP ARRIVES.\nTHERE ARE OTHER SURVIVES WHO ARE DESCRIBING THE TERRIFYING MOMENT\nTHAT THE WORLD CRUMBLED AROUND THEM.\n>> I EVEN TURNED AROUND FOR A MOMENT BECAUSE AS THOUGH SOMEONE\nWAS TRYING TO PLAY A JOKE ON ME AND PULL WHEN OFF OUT OF MY\nCHAIR.

DEAD OF NIGHT.\nEVEN THOUGH I NEF LIVED THROUGH AN EARTHQUAKE BEFORE, I WOKE UP,\nTHE HOUSE WAS SHAKING VERY INTENSELY.\nTHERE WAS THE MOST APPALLING NOISE.\nA RUMBLING LIKE THUNDER. LIKE A MACHINE WAS APPROACHING\nTHE HOUSE. I WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT AN\nEARTHQUAKE WAS. BUT I WAS IN NO DOUBT.\nMY HUSBAND WOKE UP. WE YELLED AT THE KIDS TO COME\nDOWN. WE ALL WENT OUT OF THE HOUSE\nINTO THE GARDEN. THE ELECTRICITY WAS GONE AND WE\nCOULDN'T SEE WHERE WE WERE GOING.\nWE ALL SAT THERE WONDERING WHAT ON EARTH TO DO.\n>> RIGHT NOW THE EXACT NUMBER OF PEOPLE MISSING ARE UNKNOWN AND\nTHAT'S WHY DOGS LIKE THIS ARE SCOURING THE RUBBLE PILES\nLOOKING FOR THEM. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW AT THIS POINT\nWHAT CREWS ARE DEALING WITH. PILES UPON PILES OF STONE,\nMETAL, TILE. IT IS EXTRAORDINARILY DANGEROUS.\nALL OF THIS REMNANT OF WHAT HOURS AGO IS A SERIES OF\nBEAUTIFUL HOMES AND SHOPS AND RESTAURANTS.\nTHE LIKES OF WHICH ATTRACT TOUR FRIST AMERICA ON A REGULAR\nBASIS. WE WILL ZERO IN NOW TO THE\nEPICENTER. LOOK AT YOUR MAP.\nTHIS IS AMATRICE. THIS IS NORTHEAST OF THE CITY OF\nROME. AND THE MAYOR OF AMATRICE SAYS\nHIS TOWN IS QUOTE NO MORE. THOSE ARE THE WORDS HE USED, NO\nMORE. KRP'S FREDERICK IS ON THE GROUND\nTHERE AT THE EPICENTER. CNN'S CHAD MYERS IS ALSO WITH\nUS. HE HAS BEEN LOOKING AT THE\nSEISMIC INFORMATION. FRED, I WANT TO START WITH YOU.\nI CAN ONLY IMAGINE THIS WAS A BEAUTIFUL OVER HUNDRED-YEAR-OLD\nBUILDING. TAKE ME THERE AND SHOW ME WHAT\nYOU ARE SEEING. >> YOU'RE RIGHT.\nIT IS A TRAGEDY. SOME OF THESE BUILDINGS WERE\n500, 600 YEARS OLD. I WANT YOU TO SEE THE ACTUAL\nDESTRUCTION IN THE EPICENTER. THEY ARE USING AN EXCAVATORS TO\nTRY TO TEAR DOWN A WALL. IF WE PAN BACK LEFT WE WILL SEE\nTHAT. CREWS HERE HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR\nHOURS AND HOURS SIFTING THROUGH RUBBLE.\nTHEY THINK THAT UNDER SOME OF THESE BUILDINGS PEOPLE MIGHT\nSTILL BE TRAPPED. SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAVED HERE\nFROM THE RUBBLE IN THE PAST COUPLE OF HOURS.\nAS YOU NOTED, DEATH TOLL CONTINUES TO RISE.\nHERE IN AMATRICE, THE MAYOR SAYS OUR TOWN DOESN'T EXIST ANY MORE.\nIN MANY WAYS, YOU CAN SEE HE IS RIGHT.\nYOU CAN SEE THIS BEAUTIFUL VERY, VERY OLD, SEVERAL-YEAR-OLD HOUSE\nAND YOU CAN SEE THERE IS A HOLD IN THE SIDE.\nTHERE IS JUST THE FACADE STANDING.\nEVERYTHING ELSE IS GONE. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS RESCUE CREWS\nHAVE AS THEY TRY TO DEAL WITH THE DISASTER IS THEY HAVE\nTROUBLE GETTING INTO THESE VILLAGES.\nTHIS PART OF ITALY IS SO PUT TO REST AND ROAD ARE SO OLD THAT\nTHEY ARE VERY NARROW AND THEY ARE COVERED IN DEBRIS.\nTHEY HAVE TROUBLE BRINGING THAT VERY HEAVY EQUIPMENT THAT THEY\nNEED TO SAVE PEOPLE INTO THESE LITTLE TOWNS.\nVERY, VERY DIFFICULT. I JUST WENT DOWN THE MAIN ACCESS\nROADS TO AMATRICE. THERE ARE A LOT OF TRUCKS WITH\nMOBILE CLINICS, MOBILE OPERATION ROOMS, ALSO WITH AMBULANCES,\nHAVING A LOT OF TROUBLE GETTING IN BUT THEY ARE ARE TRYING.\nBECAUSE THEY KNOW, THE FIRST 72 HOURS AFTER DISASTER LIKE THIS\nARE KEY. THEY KNOW PEOPLE TRAPPED UNDER\nTHE RUBBLE, THAT ABOUT HOW LONG A HUMAN BEING CAN SURVIVE.\n>> YOU JUST HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD.\nIT IS HARD TO FATHOM JUST HOW PICTURESQUE THAT LITTLE VILLAGE\nWAS AT ONE TIME. SEEING IT LITERALLY IN RUBBLE\nRIGHT NOW. AS SO MANY PEOPLE KNOW, THE\nROADS IN ITALY ARE SO NARROW AND HEAVY EQUIPMENT CAN'T GET IN\nTHERE. WHAT ABOUT FIRST RESPONDERS?\nPEOPLE? DOGS?\nKIND OF RESPONDERS THAT CAN DIG AND FIND SURVIVORS IN THE\nCRITICAL 72 HOURS, DO THEY AT LEAST HAVE THAT?\n>> THEY HAVE THAT. AS WE PAN INTO THAT, THAT'S THE\nMAIN ROAD THEREOF AMATRICE. AS YOU CAN SEE, IT IS ABSOLUTELY\nPACKED WITH TRUCKS. THEY ARE DOING THEIR BEST TO\nNAVIGATE THOSE AREAS. WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS TEAMS WITH\nDOGS GOING THROUGH SOME OF THE BUILDING HE.\nTRYING TO FIND SURVIVORS. ALSO SEEING FIRST RESPONDERS\nWITH THEIR BARE HANDS. IN THE BEGINNING IT WAS A VERY\nLOCAL RESPONSE. LOCAL TOWNS PEOPLE AND LOCAL\nOFFICIALS AS WELL DIGGING THROUGH THE RUBBLE WITH THEIR\nBARE HANDS. AND AS ALL OF THIS HAS GONE ON,\nMORE AND MORE ASSETS HAVE ARRIVED.\nHELICOPTERS THAT I'M HEARING NOW THAT ARE HOVERING OVER US AND\nTHE ARMY TRYING TO GET IN AS WELL.\nAGAIN, NOT HAPPENING AS FAST AS MANY WOULD LIKE.\nHOWEVER IT IS A NATIONAL EFFORT WHERE THEY ARE TRYING TO\nMEEBLIZE ALL OF THE ASSETS THEY HAVE AND AS YOU KNOW DOGS ARE\nONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS, SIFTING THROUGH THE\nRUBBLE. THEIR NOSES CAN FIND PEOPLE DEEP\nDOWN WHERE A LOT OF TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT CAN'T.\nTHAT IS ALSO A PRIORITY HERE ON THE GROUND AS WELL.\nYOU CAN SEE THERE IS A TEAM RIGHT NOW WITH A DOG ACTUALLY\nGOING TOWARD THE RUBBLE RIGHT NOW, GOING THERE INTO THE CENTER\nOF TOWN WHERE THERE IS A LOT MORE DESTRUCTION THAN WHAT WE\nSEE RIGHT HERE. THIS IS THE HARDEST HIT AND THE\nMAYOR OF THIS TOWN HAS SAID OUR TOWN DOES NOT EXIST ANY MORE\nHOWEVER THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE TRAPPED UNDER THE RUBBLE AND THE\nDEATH TOLL CONTINUES TO RISE. >> YOU CAN JUST SEE THE URGENCY\nAND THOSE RESPONDERS AROUND YOU. I WILL ASK CHAD MYERS A\nQUESTION. BUT FRED, ASK YOUR CAMERAMAN IF\nTHE HELICOPTERS END UP IN OUR PURVIEW, TRAIN THE IMAGE ON THE\nHELICOPTERS SO WE CAN SEE WHAT THEY ARE DOING.\nCHAD, I THINK THE CONCERNSOME PEOPLE HAVE, AS FRED SAID,\nDIGGING WITH THEIR BARE HANDS THROUGH WHAT CAN BE UNSTABLE\nAFTERSHOCKS. GIVE ME THE RUNDOWN OF THIS\nDISASTER. >> ITALY SAYING THEY HAVE SEEN\nMORE THAN 60 AFTERSHOCKS. MANY VERY SMALL.\nBUT THERE WAS ONE AT 5.5. THIS WAS A VERY SHALLOW QUAKE\nAND I WILL GET TO THAT IN A SECOND, ASHLEY.\nVERY CLOSE TO THE CENTRAL PART AND THE FURTHER YOU ARE FROM\nSHAKING THE LESS THE SHAKING IS BUT IF YOU HAVE THE SHAKING THAT\nOCCURS, VERY CLOSE TO THE SURFACE, TWO MILES UNDER THE\nSURFACE WAS THE SHAKE. THAT IS JUST LIKE A FRACKING\nQUAKE. VERY CLOSE, VERY SHALLOW TO THE\nSURFACE. THINK ABOUT THIS, IF YOU ONLY\nHAVE TWO MILES BEFORE IT HIT THE LAND, EVERYWHERE UP HERE WILL BE\nDEVASTATED. IF YOU MOVE THIS 70 MILES DOWN\nINTO THE EARTH'S CRUST THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU HAVE 70 MILES TO\nMOVE AWAY FROM THE FOCUS ITSELF. WHICH IS WAY DOWN HERE.\nTHAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. THIS WAS NOT A DEEP QUAKE.\nTHIS WAS NOT A THUNDER ROLLS KIND OF SONG.\nTHIS WAS A BAM. LIKE GETTING HIT BY LIGHTNING\nONLY BLOCK AWAY, NOT 10 MILES AWAY WHERE YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO\nATENUATE SOME OF THAT POWER. >> MAKES A LOT OF RESPONSE THAT\nTHOSE EYE WITNESSES GAVE US. FELT LIKE A HEAVY MACHINE WAS\nROLLING NEXT TO THEM. CHAD, THANK YOU.\nLET US KNOW ABOUT THE AFTERSHOCK STORY.\nFRED, SAME WITH YOU. WE WILL TOUCH BASE WITH YOU TO\nSEE IF THE DEATH TOLL RISE ANSWERS WHETHER THEY FIND\nSURVIVORS. FOR VIEWERS WATCHING US, YOU\nJUST CAN'T HELP BUT BE AFFECTED BY THIS.\nGOOD TO CNN.COM/IMPACT.

THAT'S THE SIGNAL FOR EVERYBODY\nTO STOP TALKING, VEHICLES TO BE SHUT OFF BECAUSE POSSIBLY THEY\nHEARD SOMETHING IN THE RUBBLE. ALL YOU HEAR IS ONE OF THOSE\nRESCUE CREW MEMBERS CALLING OUT, TRYING TO GET SOMEBODY TO ANSWER\nBACK. UNFORTUNATELY, THAT WASN'T THE\nCASE. BUT, AGAIN, THE SEARCH\nCONTINUES. DAVID, COME BACK OVER HERE, I\nWANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING VERY QUICKLY AND WHAT'S MADE IT VERY\nDIFFICULT, SHEPARD, IS AMATRICE IS ON THE SIDE OF THE CITY.\nIT'S JUST RUBBLE, YOU CAN'T GET INTO THE CITY CENTER.\nIT'S BEEN LEVELED FROM THE 6.2 EARTHQUAKE THAT HIT ABOUT 6:42\nTHIS MORNING. THEY CAN'T GET IN THE HEAVY\nEQUIPMENT BUT THEY HAVE A BACK ",

SHE'S BEEN IN THIS GIG FOR ONE\nWEEK, MOST OF WHICH YOU'VE SPEND HERE IN THE STUDIO WITH ME\nTONIGHT. IT FEELS LIKE I'M NEVER GONNA\nLET YOU GO. I HAVE TWO MORE QUESTIONS.\n>> YES. >> ONE IS ABOUT THIS HEALTH\nISSUE, AND I HAVE A VERY SPECIFIC QUESTION ABOUT THIS.\nMR. TRUMP PERSONALLY AND MEMBERS OF YOUR CAMPAIGN HAVE REPEATEDLY\nRAISED THIS QUESTION OF SECRETARY CLINTON'S HEALTH.\nTHE ONLY TESTIMONY WE HAVE OF MR. TRUMP'S HEALTH IS THIS\nLETTER FROM HIS GASTROENTEROLOGIST SAYING HIS\nRESULTS AND THAT HE'S THE HEALTHIEST INDIVIDUAL THAT WOULD\nEVER BE ELECTED TO THE PRESIDENCY.\nTHAT'S REALLY FUNNY, BUT AS A DOCTOR'S LETTER, IT'S A\nNON-SERIOUS LETTER. IT'S FULL OF TYPOS.\nMOST OF THE LETTER HAS NO MEDICAL MEANING.\nIT LINKS TO A WEBSITE THAT DOESN'T EXIST.\nIF HE WAS ELECTED, DONALD TRUMP WOULD BE THE OLDEST PERSON TO\nEVER BE SWORN IN AS PRESIDENT. WHETHER OR NOT HE'S GOING TO TRY\nTO MAKE HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH THE ISSUE, DOESN'T HE OWE IT TO\nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO RELEASE AN ACTUAL MEDICAL REPORT, A MORE\nCREDIBLE, MORE COMPLETE STATEMENT?\n>> PERHAPS. BUT I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING\nABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH. IT'S NOT AN ISSUE THAT I CARE TO\nCOMMENT ON, BECAUSE I'M NOT A DOCTOR.\nSHE'S NOT MY PATIENT. I CAN TELL YOU WHAT I SEE WITH\nMY OWN TWO EYES. I DON'T SEE SOMEONE WHO ENJOYS\nCAMPAIGNING THE WAY HE DOES. I'M WITH HIM PRACTICALLY EVERY\nDAY. HE KEEPS SUCH A CRAZY,\nRIDICULOUS PACE FOR A MAN HIS AGE, THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT\nFOR THE YOUNGER STAFFERS, OF WHICH I'M NOT ONE, TO KEEP UP\nWITH HIM, RACHEL. I MEAN, IT'S REALLY INSANE.\nHE CALLED ME YESTERDAY AND SAID, I NEED MORE RALLIES.\nHE DOESN'T JUST SHOW UP AND DO THE RALLIES.\nHE PREPARES FOR THEM. YOU HAVE TO TRAVEL.\nHE'S ALWAYS READING, HE'S ALWAYS THINKING.\nI CONFESS, I DON'T KNOW WHEN HE SLEEPS.\n>> BUT YOU AS HIS CAMPAIGN AND HIM TALKING ABOUT HIMSELF HAVE\nMADE HIS PHYSICAL VIGOR PART OF WHAT HE BRINGS TO THE CAMPAIGN,\nAND THEY'VE MADE IT A CONTRAST ISSUE WITH HILLARY CLINTON, BUT\nHILLARY CLINTON RELEASED A NORMAL DOCTOR'S STATEMENT.\nWHAT WE HAVE FROM DONALD TRUMP, THAT LETTER REALLY IS ABSURD.\nAND WE'VE CONTACTED THE DOCTOR WHO WROTE IT TO TRY TO GET SOME\nBACKGROUND. TURNS OUT HE WAS USING A MEDICAL\nCREDENTIAL ON HIS NAME THAT HE'S NO LONGER ENTITLED TO USE.\nLIKE THERE'S A LOT OF REALLY UPSTANDING THINGS ABOUT WHAT WE\nKNOW THERE. AND SO FOR ONE, WHY IS A\nGASTROENTEROLOGIST IS A DIGESTIVE SPECIALIST.\nWHY IS DONALD TRUMP SEEING A GASTROENTEROLOGIST FOR 35 YEARS?\n>> THAT, I DON'T KNOW. >> AS THE CAMPAIGN MANAGER, CAN\nI MAKE A REQUEST? >> ABSOLUTELY.\n>> CAN WE GET A MORE SUBSTANTIAL MEDICAL --\n>> I WILL PASS ON THE REQUEST. I ASSURE YOU HE HAS DOCTORS AND\nPHYSICIANS. AND I WAS TOLD BY A DIFFERENT\nANCHOR ON A DIFFERENT NETWORK, THAT HILLARY'S DOCTORS HAVE\nRELEASED HER HISTORY AND SHE'S IN GREAT HEALTH.\nI THINK STAMINA IS DIFFERENT THAN HEALTH.\nVIGOR ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. BUT I LOOK AT HILLARY CLINTON\nNOT BEING OUT THERE MORE AS A STRATEGY.\nIT'S SCARCITY AS A STRATEGY. IT'S THAT WE DON'T WANT TO PUT\nHER OUT THERE, BECAUSE WHEN WE DO, PEOPLE ARE REMINDED THAT SHE\nDOESN'T MEET THE 70% OF AMERICANS WHO WANT A CHANGE\nELECTION, A NEW DIRECTION. SHE IS THE PERSON WHO HAS EARNED\nA MAJORITY OF AMERICANS SAYING, I DISLIKE HER, I DISTRUST HER,\nBUT -- I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT COMES AFTER THE \"BUT.\"\n>> AS A POLITICAL OBSERVER, I THINK THE REASON SHE'S NOT OUT\nON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AS MUCH, THEY THINK THEY'RE WINNING AND\nTHEY DON'T WANT TO INTERRUPT THE NARRATIVE.\n>> I THINK THAT'S TERRIBLE AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY.\nIF WE WERE WINNING BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON WAS FAILING OR\nTRIPPING OVER HER WORDS, OR MESSING UP, OR SHE WAS DOWN IN\nTHE POLLS FOR WHATEVER REASON, TO SAY THE CLINTON FOUNDATION\nINVESTIGATION HELPS HER GO DOWN IN THE POLLS, WE'RE NOT GOING TO\nDISAPPEAR, I PROMISE YOU, BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT THE\nVOTERS WANT. THEY WANT TO SEE THE CANDIDATES,\nTHEY WANT TO HEAR THE CANDIDATES.\nTHEY WANT TO DIGEST THEIR PROPOSALS THAT WE'VE BEEN\nDISCUSSING TONIGHT, RACHEL AND THEY WANT TO SEE THE CONTRAST\nBETWEEN THESE TWO. NOT CONTRAST IN STYLE, NOT\nCONTRAST IN STAMINA. CONTRAST ON SUBSTANCE.\nWE'RE GOING TO FIGHT HER ON SUBSTANCE.\nAND I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED FROM WHAT I KNOW PUBLICLY, THAT HER\nSPEECH TOMORROW IN RENO, NEVADA --\n>> IS GOING TO BE ALL ABOUT YOU. >> IT'S NOT ABOUT SUBSTANCE.\n>> IT'S ABOUT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, AND THIS IS MY LAST\nQUESTION FOR YOU. AND I'M ASKING IT JUST BECAUSE I\nFEEL LIKE I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO ASK YOU, BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY\nACCESS TO ANYBODY ELSE AT THE CAMPAIGN.\nSO I HAVE TO ASK YOU. IS ROGER AILES WORKING AS PART\nOF THE DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN? >> NO.\nNEITHER FORMAL OR INFORMAL. THEY'RE OLD FRIENDS.\nHE'S DONALD TRUMP. HE TALKS TO A LOT OF PEOPLE.\n>> SO THE MEETING IN NEW JERSEY ON SUNDAY, AUGUST 14th, THAT\nDIDN'T HAPPEN? THIS IS WHAT \"THE NEW YORK\nTIMES\" REPORTED IN TERMS OF HIM COMING ON BOARD TO HELP DONALD\nTRUMP PREPARE FOR THE DEBATES, THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN?\n>> I WAS NOT THERE ON AUGUST 14th.\nSO I DIDN'T SEE WHO WAS OR WAS NOT THERE.\nBUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT THEY'RE OLD FRIENDS AND THEY TALK.\nI'M SURE THEY TALK, BUT HE TALKS TO MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE FROM\nEVERY SIDE OF THE AISLE. >> ROGER AILES, NO ROLE IN THE\nCAMPAIGN? >> NO FORMALLY OR INFORMAL ROLE\nIN THE CAMPAIGN, NO. BUT HE IS A MARKETING GENIUS.\n>> AND JUST RESIGNED HIS JOB UNDER A CLOUD OF TERRIBLE SEXUAL\nHARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS. >> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.\nI KNOW YOU WORK HARD, AND I WORK HARD.\nBUT NOT EVERY WOMAN GETS HER SHOT.\nFOR THAT I'M GRATEFUL. I WATCHED YOU FOR YEARS AND I\nSAID, SHE SHOULD HAVE HER OWN SHOW AND YOU HAVE FOR A LONG\nTIME. AND I RESPECT THAT ENORMOUSLY.\nI KNOW YOU DISAGREE WITH US PHILOSOPHICALLY, AND I HOPE MR.\nTRUMP WILL TAKE THE SEAT ONE DAY.\n>> THANK YOU. AND BACK AT YOU.\nYOU HAVE MADE HISTORY AND WOMEN BREAKING GLASS CEILINGS IN\nPOLITICS IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT WHEN IT HAPPENS.\nTHANK YOU. AND GOOD LUCK TO YOU.\nSEE, THAT WAS FINE. EVERYTHING WENT OKAY.\nWE CAN TALK TO EACH OTHER. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.",

ONE, I THINK MOST -- YOU KNOW,\nFIRST AND FOREMOST, IT WAS GARY FROM NORTH CAROLINA, HIS BRAVERY\nIN SAYING THAT, RIGHT? IT IS, NOW WE ARE AT A MOMENT\nWHERE PEOPLE ARE SORT OF CHOOSING SIDES ON RACE, AND IT\nSEEMS LIKE, YOU KNOW, THE SORT OF FOX NEWS VERSION OF THE\nRACIAL DISCOURSE IN THIS COUNTRY IS THAT AFRICAN AMERICANS THINK\nTHERE IS RACISM AND THERE ARE A MILLION REASONS WHY THERE\nAREN'T. AND SO IT DOES FEEL LIKE THERE'S\nA VESTED INTEREST IN DENYING THE EXISTENCE OF RACISM.\nAND OF COURSE THAT'S SO FAR FROM THE TRUTH.\nNOT ONLY IN OUR PUBLIC POLICIES AND OUR HISTORY, IN OUR ECONOMY,\nIN OUR POLITICS, SO VERY OBVIOUSLY, BUT ALSO IN OUR MINDS\nAND OUR HEARTS. AND WHAT I REALLY WANTED TO GET\nACROSS WAS -- AND AGAIN, THIS ALL HAPPENED VERY, VERY QUICKLY,\nYOU KNOW, I HEARD THE CALL-IN AND SOMETHING SORT OF CAME OUT\nIN ME. I WANTED HIM TO SAY, I WANTED\nHIM TO HEAR FROM ME, FROM A BLACK WOMAN WHO WORKS IN\nPOLITICS, THANK YOU FOR BEING BRAVE ENOUGH TO DO WHAT FRANKLY\nMANY PEOPLE OF COLOR WORK SO HARD TO DO, WHICH IS JUST GET US\nTO ADMIT THAT RACISM EXISTS, START THE CONVERSATION.\n>> ONE OF THE THINGS I THOUGHT WAS SO FASCINATING WAS HIS APT\nSELF-AWARENESS OF THE CAUSE OF THIS, WHICH IS READING THE\nNEWSPAPER, I MEAN, THE MEDIA THAT HE WAS CONSUMING WAS\nTELLING HIM, YOU KNOW -- >> YEAH.\n>> AND BREITBART, WHICH, WHOSE CAMPAIGN MANAGER -- OR ONE OF\nTHE CAMPAIGN HEADS IS A PERSON WHO BASICALLY IS NOW RUNNING THE\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN, THERE'S A TAG ON BREITBART CALLED BLACK CRIME.\nYOU CAN GO SORT YOUR BREITBART CONSUMPTION BY #BLACK CRIME, AND\nTHAT'S NOT LIMITED TO THEM. >> NO, IT'S NOT.\nTHERE'S A VERY CLEAR NARRATIVE THAT, YOU KNOW, IT'S IN THE\nALT-RIGHT, IT'S BREITBART, BUT IT'S ALSO FOX, AND OF COURSE\nIT'S ALSO DONALD TRUMP, WHICH IS JUSTIFYING RACIAL INEQUALITY.\nAND THE THING THAT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR US TO REMEMBER,\nTHAT'S NOT NEW. YOU KNOW, I OFTEN TRY TO PUT\nMYSELF IN THE SHOES OF A WHITE PERSON IN THE ERA OF\nSEGREGATION, AND IF I JUST SORT OF SUPPORTED THE WAY THAT LIFE\nWAS ORDERED AND THE SORT OF MY PLACE IN THE WORLD, WOULD I HAVE\nBEEN JUST A TOTALLY DIFFERENT CARTOONISH EVIL TYPE OF PERSON?\nOBVIOUSLY NOT. THESE ARE MANY WHITE AMERICANS'\nGRANDPARENTS AND GREAT GRANDPARENTS.\nBUT IN FACT, YOU HAD TO HAVE BEEN SORT OF SURROUNDED BY\nIMAGES, STORIES, MYTHS, NARRATIVES THAT WERE EXCUSES FOR\nWHY IT WAS -- >> THEY WERE JUSTIFICATIONS.\n>> THEY WERE JUSTIFICATIONS, AND THAT'S WHERE WE ARE TODAY.\n>> PEOPLE DID NOT GO INTO LYNCH MOBS BECAUSE THE PERSON -- THEY\nDIDN'T TELL THEMSELVES THEY'RE A LYNCH MOB BECAUSE THE PERSON WAS\nBLACK. THEY TOLD THEMSELVES THEY WERE A\nLYNCH MOB BECAUSE THE PERSON HAD COMMITTED A HORRIBLE CRIME.\nTHAT'S WHAT THEY WERE TELLING THEMSELVES.\nPEOPLE TELL THEMSELVES ALL SORTS OF STORIES.\n>> BUT RIGHT NOW, WE'RE AT THIS MOMENT, I THINK, WHEN THERE'S AN\nINCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY -- >> THERE IS.\n>> -- FOR AMERICANS TO SORT OF REENGAGE IN THIS QUESTION OF\nWHAT IT MEANS TO BE AMERICAN, WHO BELONGS, WHO DESERVES TO BE\nSORT OF INSIDE THE CIRCLE OF HUMAN CONCERN.\n>> AND WHAT WE LOOK LIKE AS A DIMOS, AS A PEOPLE.\nI WANT TO YOU RESPOND TO THIS.

TAKE A LISTEN.\n>> HILLARY CLINTON IS A BIGGOT WHO SEES PEOPLE OF COLOR ONLY AS\nVOTES, NOT AS HUMAN BEINGS WORTHY OF A BETTER FUTURE.\n>> YEAH, UM, SO, TO BE FAIR, I THINK MOST POLITICIANS SEE\nPEOPLE AS VOTES. >> THAT'S RIGHT.\n>> BUT, YOU KNOW, DONALD TRUMP IS AT ZERO TO 1% WITH THE\nAFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY FOR A REASON.\nAND WHETHER IT'S THE WAY THAT HE SORT OF BURST ONTO THE SCENE IN\nNEW YORK AS A SLUM LORD WHO HAD TO SETTLE, YOU KNOW, MASSIVE\nCASE OF ANTI-BLACK DISCRIMINATION, TO HIS LEADING\nAND MAINSTREAMING OF BIRTHER MOVEMENT.\nTHERE'S NOT MUCH HE CAN DO TO SORT OF UNREMIND US OF HOW HE\nREALLY FEELS ABOUT THE BLACK COMMUNITY.\n>> BUT WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THAT MOMENT AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHO\nTHAT GUY IS VOTING FOR OR SUPPORTING, IS THAT THERE'S\nDONALD TRUMP, AND HE'S SORT OF RUNG THE BELL HE'S GOING TO\nRING. BUT THERE'S MILLIONS OF FELLOW\nCITIZENS WHO MAY BE SUPPORTS HIM OR NOT, AND THEY CAN UNRING THE\nBELL. THEY CAN BE DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN\nTHEIR RACIAL ATTITUDES THAN THEY WERE YESTERDAY.\n>> ABSOLUTELY. >> THANK YOU.\nTHAT IS \"ALL IN\" FOR THE EVENING.\n>> THANKS TO YOU AT HOME FOR STAYING WITH US FOR THE NEXT\nHOUR.

FOR THE LAST 14 MONTHS IT LOOKED\nLIKE HE WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF FOX NEWS.\nNOW HE'S FINALLY REALIZED THAT YOU HAVE TO EXPAND YOUR BASE,\nBECAUSE WHITE PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH TO GET YOU\nELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\n>> IS IT TOO LATE, THOUGH? IF YOU LOOK AT POLL NUMBERS,\nHE'S GOT 20% OF LATINO VOTERS. HE'S POLLING AT SOMETHING LIKE\n1% OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS. YES, HE WANTS TO CHANGE HIS\nMESSAGE.

SCOTT GOTTLIEB AND DR. SCOTT WAXELL.\nI HATE WHEN A REALLY NICE STORY OF GREEDY CORPORATE GOUGING HAS\nOTHER NUANCES TO IT. IT RUINS EVERYTHING FOR THE\nPOLITICIANS, FOR THE DEMAGOGUING AND EVERYTHING ELSE.\nBUT THE JOURNAL -- CAN I CALL YOU SCOTT?\nI KEEP SAYING DOCTOR, IT JUST GIVES YOU MORE CREDIBILITY.\nTHE JOURNAL POINTS OUT THAT IF THERE WERE GENERIC VERSIONS --\nIF THERE WASN'T SO MUCH RED TAPE GENERIC VERSIONS WOULD QUICKLY\nCURE -- CERTAINLY COMPANIES ARE GOING TO TRY TO MAXIMIZE\nPROFITS. THAT'S WHAT CAPITALISM IS ABOUT.\nIF IT'S A MONOPOLY, YOU CAN'T EXPECT DIFFERENT BEHAVIOR.\n>> THESE COMPLEX DRUGS HAVE BECOME DWIFLT TO GET ON THE\nMARKET. NOT JUST EPI-PENS.\nANY TIME IT'S HARD FOR THE AGENCY TO DEMONSTRATE SAVINGS,\nTHE AGENCY HAS A HARD TIME. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS VERY\nISSUE TEN YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS AT FDA.\nTO YOUR POINT, ONE COMPETITOR WAS DRIVEN FROM THE MARKET.\nAND THERE ARE THREE TRYING TO GET ON THE MARKET.\nSO WE CAN'T BE SURPRISED WHEN A COMPANY HANDED A MONOPOLY ACTS\nAS A MONOPOLIST. >> IN THIS CASE THIS DOESN'T\nSEEM LIKE IT'S THAT HARD TO EITHER DESIGN OR MAKE ONE OF\nTHESE THINGS THAT WILL WORK. AND EVEN THE ADRENALINE WORKS AS\nWELL BUT YOU CAN'T SUBSTITUTE THAT.\n>> I THINK THEY NEED FLEXIBILITY WHEN IT COMES TO TRADING FOR THE\nDIFFICULT TO FORMULATE DRUGS. THEY NEED SOME FLEXIBILITY\nWITHIN THE PROCESS SO THE SAME COULD BE DEMONSTRATED\nDIFFERENTLY. >> YEAH.\nI MEAN HERE YOU HAVE A CASE WHERE THE EPINEPHRINE IS CHEAP\nAND IT ISN'T HARD TO COPY. IT'S THE EPI-PEN.\n>> IT'S THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL TECHNOLOGY.\n>> IT'S THE PHYSICAL TECHNOLOGY. IT'S THE EPI-PEN.\nSO THAT'S BEEN DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO COPY.\nTEVA IS MOVING ALONG. IT'S GOING TO GET A PRODUCT ON\nTHE MARKET. BUT THIS IS NUANCED.\nAND I ALWAYS TRY VERY HARD BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE DEMAGOGUERY.\nAND HERE WE HAVE AN ELECTION WHERE BOTH SIDES LOVE TO PLAY TO\nTHE MASSES. I WORRY ABOUT THAT BECAUSE, YOU\nKNOW, YOU HEAR THINGS THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY TRUE.\nSO WE HAVE INNOVATION. EVERYBODY WANTS TO HAVE DRUGS\nTHAT SAVE THEIR LIVES. AND THAT'S A DIFFERENT SET OF\nQUESTIONS. IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT WE\nDON'T ALWAYS THINK ABOUT THAT. BUT ON THE OTHER END OF THINGS,\nIT'S NOT JUST THE GENERIC COMPANIES.\nYOU'VE GOT PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGERS LIKE EXPRESS GRIPS\nWHOSE JOB IT IS TO FORCE PRICES DOWN.\nBUT THEY OWN SPECIALTY PHARMACIES WHO WANT HIGHER\nPRICED DRUGS SO THEY MAKE MORE MONEY.\nBECAUSE 30%, 40% SOMETIMES OF THOSE PRICES ARE GOING TO\nSPECIAL NEED PHARMACIES. >> HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHAT A\nCONSUMER WOULD PAY AND WHAT A CONSUMER SHOULD PAY?\nTHE CONSUMERS ARE SAYING MAYBE IT WOULD BE WORTH $600 TO ME IF\nIT CURED THE ALLERGY OR IF IT LASTED MORE THAN A YEAR.\nIT'S NOT EFFECTIVE AFTER A YEAR SO YOU HAVE TO KEEP RESTOCKING\nTHEM IF YOU DON'T USE IT. >> WELL, THERE ARE RULES ABOUT\nTHAT. WHEN THEY STOCK THEM, THEY HAVE\nTO THROW THEM AWAY AFTER A YEAR. BUT THAT ISN'T THE ISSUE.\nAND THE CONSUMER ISN'T THE ONE WHO'S REALLY DECIDING WHEN IT IS\nA MONOPOLY. >> IF THERE WAS A COMPETITIVE\nMARKET, WHAT SHOULD AN EPI-PEN COST?\n>> THIS STARTED AT $57. IF YOU LOOKED AT THE DATA WHEN\nTHERE'S FOUR MORE COMPETITORS TO THE MARKET, IT DROPS 70%.\nIF WE HAD MORE ON THE MARKET, THIS WOULD BE ABOUT A HUNDRED\nBUCKS. >> SO TEVA'S GOING TO FORCE THE\nPRICE DOWN NEXT YEAR. >> WHEN THE FDA GETS TO IT.\n>> IT MIGHT BE MORE THAN A YEAR. ZBLIT MIGHT BE MORE THAN A YEAR\nBECAUSE THE FDA DOESN'T GET ITS ACT TOGETHER.\n>> ESPECIALLY THE HARD TO FORMULATE DRUGS.\n>> ONE IS NOT WORKING FAST ENOUGH TO GET IT GOING.\nTHE OTHER IS A CRONY CAPITALISM ISSUE WHICH IS YOU HAVE A\nCOMPANY AND OTHERS TRYING TO GET IN TO LOBBY SCHOOLS AND\nMUNICIPALITIES TO KEEP THE EPI-PENS ON HAND.\nIS THAT A BAD THING? >> YOUR PAPER POINTS OUT THAT\nTHEY BRING UP NOT BEING ABLE TO NEGOTIATE WITH MEDICARE --\n>> WHICH IS ANOTHER ISSUE. >> THE HIGHER UTILIZATION THE\nSCHOOLS HAVING TO STOCK IT, THAT'S A HIGHER REVENUE PRODUCT.\nTHE MARKET IS WORKING TOO SLOWLY BECAUSE THE AVERAGE DRUG TAKES\nFOUR YEARS TO GET APPROVED. >> WHAT DO WE NEED TO TAKE THAT\nDOWN? WE ALL NEED IT TO COME DOWN.\n>> THE FDA HAS TO ALTER -- THE FDA WORKS HARD.\nWE SAY WE'VE GOT IT UNDER CONTROL.\nAND IT TAKES INSTEAD OF SIX MONTHS TO GET A GENERIC ON THE\nMARKET, IT TAKES TWO YEARS, THREE YEARS, FOUR YEARS.\n>> DO THEY HAVE THE WRONG PEOPLE, THE WRONG PROCESSES?\n>> I THINK WE NEED TO CONSIDER A NEW CLASS OF DRUGS FOR COMPLEX\nGENERICS WHERE THEY MIGHT NEED TO ASK FOR ADDITIONAL\nCOMPLIMENTS OF DATA TO SATISFACTION THEY'RE THE SAME AS\nTHE BRANDED DRUG. TRYING TO PUT COMPLEX DRUGS\nTHROUGH AN OLD REGULATORY PROCESS IS NOT WORKING.\nTHEY'RE SAYING THEY KNOW HOW TO DO THIS.\nLITERALLY I COULD POINT TO THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT TEN YEARS\nAGO ON THIS VERY ISSUE AND HAVEN'T SOLVED IT IN A DECADE.\n>> SO THIS KEEPS HAPPENING, RIGHT?\nAND WE CALLED HIM SHREKKY YESTERDAY.\nIT'S SHKRELI BUT WE'VE SEEN THE SAME THING HAPPENING HERE.\nLET'S SAY HILLARY GETS IN, SAM. JUST --\n>> OR TRUMP. >> TRUMP'S NOT TALKING ABOUT\nDRUG PRICES TO THE SAME EXTENT HILLARY IS.\n>> BUT I THINK IN THE END, WHETHER ONE PLAYS TO PEOPLE'S\nFEARS OF CONSTANTLY RISING DRUG PRICES.\nIN THE END, IF SOMEONE REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT CAREFULLY AS\nSCOTT HAS, YOU'D BE IN A SITUATION WHERE INNOVATION GETS\nREWARDED FOR THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT YOU NEED IT TO.\nAND THAT'S CRITICAL. BECAUSE WHAT WE DO IN MEDICAL\nRESEARCH TSH. >> YOU'RE PREACHING TO THE\nCHOIR. BUT YOU REMEMBER HILLARY HAD THE\nORIGINAL HILLARYCARE? >> I DO.\n>> SO THIS IS A LONG STANDING IDEA OF HERS.\nPEOPLE ALL SAY SHE'S SAYING THAT NOW.\nYOU DON'T TAKE ANYTHING SHE SAYS SERIOUSLY BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO\nIDEA. WHEN SHE GETS IN, SHE WON'T DO\nANY OF THIS? >> THERE'S A FAIRLY DETAILED\nPROPOSAL THAT CAME OUT FROM THE AMERICAN CENTER FOR PROGRESS\nTHAT LAYS OUT A LOT OF WHAT I THINK HILLARY WOULD DO.\nA LOT OF WHAT SHE IS SAYING IS IN CONCERT WITH THAT PLAN.\nIT WOULD HURT THE CYCLE, YES. >> ONE HAS TO WORK VERY HARD OUT\nTHERE BOTH IN OUR LEGISLATIVE PROCESS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY\nPEOPLE HAVE TO BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND NUANCE.\nI SAID THIS BEFORE HERE. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE\nDIFFERENCE BETWEEN \"X\" AND \"Y.\" AND IF YOU DON'T, YOU'LL DO\nTERRIBLE THINGS TO OUR COUNTRY. >> WE HAVE A VERY CAREFUL\nBALANCE IN THIS COUNTRY BETWEEN REWARDING INNOVATION AND\nALLOWING BRISK COMPETITION. THE QUESTION IS THAT BALANCE\nBEING STRUCK IN THIS CASE? THE ANSWER IS NO BECAUSE WE'RE\nNOT REWARDING INNOVATION IN THIS CASE.\nTHAT'S WHERE THE REGULATION IS FAILING.\n>> I LOVE THINGS FROM THE CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS.\nTHEY'RE ALL SO REGRESSIVE. IT'S WEIRD.\nI THINK IT'S LIKE NEGATIVE GROWTH WHICH WE DON'T CALL LIKE\nA RECESSION. YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK IT IS?\nTHINGS LIKE CALLING A BALD GUY CURLY.\nRIGHT? THEY DON'T MEAN PROGRESS.\n>> WHEN SAM CAME ON HERE, HE WANTED TO BE IN THE MIDDLE.\nWE WEREN'T GOING TO BE TURNING --\n>> I KNOW WHAT SAM REALLY THINKS.\nOKAY? HE CALLED YOU A COMMUNIST WHEN\nHE SAT DOWN. >> WHAT I REALLY THINK IS --\n>> WHAT DO YOU REALLY THINK? >> THAT GOVERNMENT -- LOOK.\nWE ALL HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES. EACH GROUP HAS RESPONSIBILITIES\nSO THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY HAS RESPONSIBILITIES.\nITS RESPONSIBILITIES ARE TO INNOVATE, BIOTECH THE SAME WAY,\nAND TO BE REWARDED FOR THAT. THE GENERICS INDUSTRY IS NOT\nINNOVATION. SO OUR GOVERNMENT AND THE FDA\nHAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT ONCE A DRUG A OFF PATENT, HOW DO\nWE GET COMPETITION IN THERE SO PRICES DROG BY 80%.\n>> HOLD ON. FOR YOUR INDUSTRY, WHICH\nCANDIDATE IS BETTER? >> I ACTUALLY THINK THAT FOR OUR\nINDUSTRY, IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE.\n>> LET ME DEFEND THE GENERICS INDUSTRY.\nTHEY DO INNOVATE MANUFACTURING A LOT.\n>> THEY DO. TEVA TRIES VERY HARD TO CREATE\nNEW DRUG ENTITIES. >> AND CHEAPER MANUFACTURING\nPROCESSES. >> BUT IN THE END, ONCE A DRUG\nGOES OFF PATENT, IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF SOCIETY TO SAY\nTHAT PATENT'S GONE. WE NOW WANT A CHEAPER PRODUCT\nFOR PATIENTS. AND WE WANT TO DROP PRICES.\nAND THAT'S CRITICAL. >> TELL ME NOTHING HURTS A\nCOMPANY MORE THAN NEGATIVE EARNINGS.\nI'M NOT GOING TO CALL IT A LOSS. >> BY THE WAY, ON THIS SHOW YOU\nGUYS TALK ABOUT COMPANIES AND STOCKS AND HEDGE FUNDS WATCH,\nINVESTORS WATCH. IF THOSE COMPANIES GET TRASHED\nBY MRS. CLINTON OR BY DONALD TRUMP, THOSE HEDGE FUND MANAGERS\nWON'T BE INVESTING IN ANYTHING. YOU WILL DESTROY AMERICAN\nMARKETS. AND WE MAKE 60% OF THE NEW DRUGS\nIN THE WORLD. >> YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN AN IMPACT\nFROM THE -- >> ALREADY.\nOF COURSE. LOOK, I DON'T KNOW -- YOU DON'T\nREMEMBER, ANDREW, BUT JOE REMEMBERS.\nIN 1993 WHEN PEOPLE REALLY WERE WORRIED ABOUT THE HILLARYCARE,\nYOU SAW MERCK, PFIZER JUST TANK. YOU SAW THEM BUY PHARMACY\nBENEFIT MANAGERS. MERCK BOUGHT MEDCO BECAUSE THEY\nWERE AFRAID. AFRAID.\n>> YOU'VE SEEN THE IPO MARKET REACT TO SO M OF THE NEGATIVE\nHEADLINES ALREADY. >> BACK TO THE FUTURE.\nI CAN'T BELIEVE WE MAY BE GOING -- I WANT TO SEE SOME OF\nTHIS. I LOVE THAT FINGER WAGGING\nBEFORE THE BLUE DRESS? I LOVE THAT.\nANYWAY, A PROGRAMMING NOTE -- THANK YOU, GUYS.\nPROGRAMMING NOTE. MYLAN CEO HEATHER BRESCH GOING\nTO SIT IS DOWN FROM THE MARKET SITE.\nTHAT'S COMING UP ON CNBC RIGHT HERE AT 8:30 A.M. EASTERN. >> I DID NOT HAVE SEXUAL RELSS.\n>> I DID NOT.

HATE LOSING 4% TO 7% BECAUSE\nSOMEBODY GOT IT WRONG WHAT THE FED WOULD DO.\nGOING TO VEGAS AND PUTTING IT ALL ON BLACK IS WHAT THAT IS.\n>> I DON'T DISAGREE AT ALL. AS A MATTER OF FACT, I TRADED\nIT, AND ADDED TO IT ACTUALLY THIS MORNING, REVVED IT UP A\nLITTLE BIT. LOOK, THAT'S WHAT THEY NEED.\nAND THEY'LL BE INTO PERSIA A LONG, LONG TIME AND NEVER RETAIN\nWHAT WAS IN THE PAST THE RLE TARGETS.\nGO WHERE PEOPLE HATE THINGS. LAST MONTH I BOUGHT, UP OVER\n20%. WHY?\nBECAUSE EVERYBODY HATED IT. YET IT'S A QUALITY COMPANY.\nJUST WENT THROUGH ITS CAP CYCLE. BOUGHT ANOTHER, DOING WELL,\nBECAUSE EVERYBODY HATED IT. THE MARKET'S BRUTAL IF YOU MISS\nAND IF YOU BUY A QUALITY COMPANY AND CONSIDER THE UPSIDE TO IT,\nYOUR DOWN SIDE CAN REALIZE AND THEN YOU SEE THE UP SIDE.\n>> QUICK -- >> COMING BACK TO THE\nFINANCIALS, MORE TO IT THAN JUST THE FED.\nKEVIN IS RIGHT IN THE SHORT TERM, BUT PAST THE NEXT MONTH OR\nSO LOOK AT EARNINGS, CONTINUED TO OUTPERFORM IN THE FINANCIALS\nDESPITE THE LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT NAP WILL CONTINUE.\n>> SWITCH GEARS AND EMERGING MARKETS AND RALLY MODE.\nEEM UP 15% THIS YEAR. AND GLOBAL CHIEF INVESTMENT\nSTRATEGIST, UPSIDE IN MERGING EQUITIES.\nGREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US. YOU UPGRADE EMERGING MARKETS TO\nAN OVERWEIGHT. DID THAT HAPPEN TODAY?\n>> WE UPGRADED LAST WEEK. >> ALL RIGHT.\nIS THAT AFTER, STILL, A SIZABLE RALLY.\nWHY NOW? >> YEAH.\nEMERGING MARKETS HAVE DONE VERY WELL THIS YEAR.\nAND THINK WE CAN DO BETTER. SEEING EVIDENCE THIS IS MOVING\nINTO A VIRTUOUS CYCLE. A POSITIVE ENVIRONMENT A SWEET\nSPOT FOR IN TIME. YOU'RE SEEING THAT, SPREADING\nOUT TO SOMETHING THAT'S MORE SUSTAINABLE.\nFED ON HOLD, CREATING A MORE STABLE DOLLAR.\nCREATED FLOWS INTO EMERGING MARKETS, AND NOW THOSE FLOWS\nINTO -- HEALTHY INTEREST RATES COME DOWN, WITHIN THE YEAR.\n25 RATE CUTS IN EMERGING MARKETS THIS YEAR AND NOW MOST\nIMPORTANTLY, STARTING TO SEE THAT WITH SOME IMPROVEMENTS IN\nTHE FUNDAMENTALS WITHIN EMERGING MARKETS.\nEARNINGS MOMENTUM TURNING POSITIVE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN\nFIVE YEARS. WE THINK THAT'S GOING TO LEAD\nFLOWS BACK. >> AND IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE\nMAJOR MARO DRIVERS, THOSE ARE ALREADY IN AND GOING FORWARD,\nTHEY MAY BE DIMINISHING. I MEAN, THE FED STAYING LOWER\nFOR LONGER. MOST PEOPLE BELIEVE THERE'S\nGOING TO BE RATE HIKE SOMETIME BY THE END OF THE YEAR OR EARLY\nNEXT AT THE VERY LATE EFFORT AND IN TERMS OF RECOVERY IN\nCOMMODITY PRICES WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF THAT AND SEEING OIL BUFF\nAROUND A LOT OF ANALYSTS SAYING, WE'LL BE IN THIS.\nWHAT IS ACTUALLY THE THING THAT'S GOING TO KEEP EMERGING\nMARKETS GOING FROM HERE? IF THOSE THINGS ARE ALL ON THE\nTABLE ARE DIMINISHING? >> FIRSTLY, THE 15% RALLY IN EM\nTHIS YEAR INTO CONTEXT. THAT COMES AFTER A 40% DECLINE\nOVER THE PREVIOUS THREE YEARS. IN TERMS OF FLOWS, 26 BILLION\nCOME BACK. >> A YEAR.\nA LOT OF MONEY. 150 BILLION WENT OUT SINCE 2013.\nSIMPLY REVERSING A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF THE UNDER PERFORMANCE\nOVER THE PREVIOUS THREE YEARS. SO YOUR QUESTION IS OKAY.\nSO WHAT GETS THIS GOING? WHAT GETS THIS INTO A MUCH MORE\nSUSTAINABLE RAL RALLY? THE FED CAUTIOUS NEEDS TO REMAIN\nIN A CAUTIOUS STANCE. I THINK THE STABLE DOLLAR IS\nCRITICAL, BUT WHAT REALLY STARTS TO GET FLOWS ACCELERATING,\nIMPROVEMENT IN THE FUNDAMENTALS. YOU MENTIONED STOCK, EARNINGS\nPICK UP, SEE GROWTH STABILIZED. THE GLOBAL INTEREST RATE, MORE\nSTABLE GLOBAL ECONOMY IS CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE\nTHAT LOW-GROWTH WORLD ACTUALLY EMERGING MARKETS HAVE STARTED TO\nLOOK LIKE THE MOST ATTRACTIVE OPTION.\n>> SO, RICHARD, I ACTUALLY AGREE WITH WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT PUTTING\nTHE MOVE INTO CONTEXT. UP 15% YEAR TO DATE, BUT 40% OFF\nTHE LOW. WHEN YOU TAKE IT BACK FURTHER,\nFROM AN ASSET ALLOCATION STANDPOINT AND THINK ABOUT LEAN\nREVERSION AND HOW LONG AND HOW DRASTIC THE UNDER PERFORMANCE\nHAS BEEN, YOU'RE ASSET CLASS IS ESSENTIALLY FLAT OVER FIVE YEARS\nWHILE THE S&P IS UP, I DON'T KNOW, 75%, 100%, IN 12-MONTH INCREMENTS.\nOUTRAGEOUS TO SAY THAT, ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.\nYOU MISSED THE TRADE. ONE THING I THINK MAYBE IS WORTH\nSPEAKING TO AND WOULD LOVE YOUR TAKE ON THIS, BY DEFINITION,\nTHIS IS A VOLATILE ASSET CLASS. ON A MONTHLY BASIS, 60% MORE\nVOLATILE THAN THE S&P. QUOTING BACK TO THE LATE '80s.\nIS THERE A POINT THAT CHANGES? WILL EM ALWAYS BE, YOU KNOW,\nSORT NF THAT SAME CATEGORY AS SMALL CAP U.S., WHERE IT'S JUST\nGOING TO BE WILDER THAN THE S&P AND PEOPLE HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT\nIF THEY WANT THAT DIVERSIFICATION BENEFIT?\n>> I THINK ALWAYS MORE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH EMERGING\nMARKETS. POLITICAL RISK, ECONOMIC RISK.\nTO SOME DEGREE COVENANTSY RISK. ARE YOU PAID FOR TAKING THAT\nRISK? THE CONVERSATION YOU HEARD, LOOK\nAT THE BELL MARKET, LOOK AT CREDIT.\nINCREASINGLY YOU'RE NOT BEING PAID IN ANY PART OF THE MARKET\nFOR TAKING RISK, WHEN EMERGING MARKETS YOU STILL ARE BEING\nPAID. ALSO WORTH NOTING YOU SEE THIS\nBACK-TO-BACK RECENTLY. VAST MAJORITY OF OUR CLIENTS,\nINVESTORS AROUND THE WORLD, STILL UNDERWEIGHT EMERGING\nMARKETS, STILL SCARRED BY THE EXPERIENCE OF THE LAST THREE TO\nFIVE YEARS. THIS IS A SMALL MOVE IN THE\nCONTEXT WHAT WE'VE SEEN PREVIOUSLY.\n>> RICHARD, ALSO UNDERWEIGHT EUROPE.\nWHY? >> WELL, CONCERNS PRIMARILY\nAROUND THE BANKS. A LOW GROWTH ENVIRONMENT, A LOW\nINTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT CREATES HUGE STRUCTURAL HEAD\nWINDS ON THE BUSINESS MODELS OF THE BANKS.\nWE DON'T SEE A LOT OF THOSE THINGS CHANGING SOON.\nIN FACT, SEE THOSE GETTING WORSE, PARTICULARLY THE INTEREST\nRATE ENVIRONMENT FROM THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANKS.\nTHE BANKS THEMSELVES ARE RELATIVELY SLOW TO ADDRESS THOSE\nISSUES IN TERMS OF CUTTING COSTS, TRANSITIONING BUSINESS\nMODELS'S THAT KEEPS US CAUTIOUS. STILL THINK IT'S TOO EARLY TO\nBUY INTO SOME OF THOSE NOTIONALLY CHEAP SECTORS WHERE\nTHE HEAD WINDS ARE STILL STRONG. >> THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.\nAPPRECIATE IT.",

BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE PAYING A LOT\nFOR SAFETY. I WOULD ARGUE THEY'RE PAYING WAY\nTOO MUCH FOR SAFETY. >> THAT WOULD BE REFLECTED IN\nYOUR TOP HOLDINGS PORTFOLIO. I'M LOOKING AT THE TOP FIVE\nHERE. BNP PARIBAS, GLENCORE WHICH\nMINOR COMMODITY TRADER OR FINANCE COMPANY.\n>> ALL OF THE ABOVE. >> RIGHT.\nTELL ME ABOUT GLENCORE ONLY BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THE MOST\nCONTROVERSIAL STOCKS. >> GLENCORE HAS BEEN A TEXTBOOK\nRESTRUCTURING STORY. RECALL ABOUT 11 MONTHS AGO THEY\nWERE KIND OF CAUGHT WITH TOO MUCH DEBT AT THE LOW END OF THE\nCOMMODITIES CYCLE. ABOUT A QUARTER OR THIRD OF\nTHEIR BUSINESS IS NOT AFFECTED BY THE CYCLE AS MUCH BECAUSE\nTHEY'RE TRADERS. AND THEY BASICALLY ARE\nDELIVERING COMMODITIES, BUYING AND SELLING TO THE GO BETWEEN\nMAN. BUT IT'S THE OTHER TWO-THIRDS,\nTHREE-QUARTERS OF THEIR BUSINESS THAT ARE EXPOSED TO COPPER,\nCOAL, ZINC. AS A RESULT THEY UNDERTOOK A\nRESTRUCTURING. WHICH REALLY THEY'VE DONE A VERY\nGOOD JOB AT IT. THEY'VE CUT DEBT FROM AROUND $40\nBILLION TO PROJECTED TO BE LESS THAN $20 BILLION.\nTHE EQUITY RAISES IN CAPEX. SO THEY'RE DOING ALL THE RIGHT\nTHINGS AND GENERATING FREE CASH. >> HOLD ON ONE SECOND.\nOUR GUEST HOST NIGEL TRAVIS HAS A QUESTION.\n>> GOOD MORNING. >> GOOD MORNING.\n>> OBVIOUSLY BEING A BRIT",

              "text": ">>> ALL RIGHT, WELCOME BACK TO\n\"NEW DAY.\" WE JUST HEARD CHRIS'S INTERVIEW\nWITH KELLYANNE CONWAY, TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS.\nSHE TALKED ABOUT A DOUBLE STANDARD FOR CLINTON VERSUS\nTRUMP. SHE TALKED ABOUT HIS SHIFT ON\nIMMIGRATION. A LOT TO GET THROUGH.\nLET'S DISCUSS IT WITH POLITICAL COMMENTATOR AND TRUMP SUPPORTER,\nJOHN PHILLIPS, AND ALSO FORMER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE\nCONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS, ANGELA RYE, AND POLITICAL\nCOMMENTATOR AND REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST, ANA NAVARRO.\nLET ME BEGIN WITH YOU, ANA, ON IMMIGRATION.\nIF YOU ARE JEB BUSH, IF YOU ARE MARCO RUBIO THIS MORNING AND\nSITTING AT HOME AND WATCHING WHAT TRUMP SAID ABOUT\nIMMIGRATION AND WORKING WITH THEM AND CLEARLY A FLIP-FLOP IN\nCHANGING HIS STANCE, TWOFOLD QUESTION TO YOU.\nWAS THIS HIS PLAN ALL ALONG, KNOWING THE PATH TO 70 MILLION\nPLUS VOTES IN A GENERAL IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT THAN A PRIMARY,\nAND DOES IT HELP WIN BACK FOLKS LIKE YOU, SAYING ALL RIGHT, I'VE\nLEARNED SOME THINGS, AND WE'RE GOING TO SOFTEN UP THIS STANCE?\n>> WELL, LISTEN, I HOPE JEB BUSH IS AT THE GYM AND I HOPE MARCO\nRUBIO IS CAMPAIGNING. HE HAS A PRIMARY RACE IN LESS\nTHAN A WEEK IN FLORIDA. I THINK, LET ME START WITH YOUR\nLAST QUESTION. DOES IT HELP WIN OVER PEOPLE\nLIKE ME. FIRST OF ALL, LET ME JUST SAY, I\nDON'T SPEAK FOR ALL HISPANICS. I DON'T SPEAK FOR ALL\nREPUBLICANS. I SPEAK FOR MYSELF AND A LOT OF\nHISPANICS FEEL THE SAME WAY I DO.\n>> JUST TO BE CLEAR, ANA, WHAT I MEANT, AND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN\nMORE CLEAR, DOES IT HELP WIN OVER PEOPLE IN THE REPUBLICAN\nPARTY WHO WERE -- WHO HAVE NOT BEEN ON THE TRUMP TRAIN?\n>> HERE'S WHAT I THINK IS HAPPENING.\nHERE IS WHAT -- FIRST OF ALL, I HEARD KELLYANNE CONWAY TODAY.\nSHE IS SUCH A CLASS ACT. SHE IS THE FIRST PERSON RUNNING\nTHAT CAMPAIGN WHO ACTUALLY SEEMS NORMAL.\nSHE KNOWS WHAT SHE IS DOING. SHE IS THE FIRST ONE THAT I\nWOULD LEAVE MY PUPPY WITH AND THINK AND HOPE IT WOULD STILL BE\nALIVE WHEN I CAME BACK. I THINK THAT KELLYANNE REALIZED\nTHAT WHEN YOU WERE HAVING FOCUS GROUPS, AND REMEMBER, HER\nBACKGROUND IS A POLLSTER, A VERY GOOD ONE, WHEN YOU WERE HAVING\nFOCUS GROUPS, THEY WERE SAYING DONALD TRUMP IS A RACIST.\nTHAT'S A FULL STOP WHEN IT CAME TO DONALD TRUMP.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE MAY NOT LIKE HILLARY CLINTON.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE MAY NOT LIKE DONALD TRUMP.\nBUT WHEN YOU HAVE THE WORD RACIST IN THERE, IT BECOMES A\nFULL STOP WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE ANYBODY ELSE.\nSO AT THIS POINT, KELLYANNE HAS GOT TO SHIFT THAT IMAGINE, THAT\nPERCEPTION OF DONALD TRUMP AS A RACIST, BECAUSE IT JUST\nPARALYZES ANYTHING ELSE. ANY OTHER PROGRESS THAT DONALD\nTRUMP CAN MAKE WITH PEOPLE THAT MAY BE ON THE FENCE THAT MAY NOT\nLIKE EITHER OF THEM AND HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE BETWEEN THE TWO OF\nTHEM. >> SO ANGELA, YOU JUST HEARD AND\nTHE VIEWERS HEARD CHRIS PRESS HER ON THE TRUMP'S USE OF THE\nWORD BIGOT. SHE SAID THERE IS A TOTAL DOUBLE\nSTANDARD, HAVE YOU HEARD WHAT HILLARY CLINTON SAYS ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP. SHE EVEN TALKED ABOUT THE MEDIA,\nHAVE YOU HEARD WHAT THE MEDIA SAYS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP.\nSHE SAYS THERE IS A TOTAL DOUBLE STANDARD HERE AND YOU SHOULD NOT\nBE FOCUSING ON ONE WORD. YOU SHOULD LOOK AT THE TOTALITY\nOF HIS REMARKS, AND HIS ACTIONS. ANY WEIGHT THAT YOU GIVE THAT,\nANGELA? >> NO, ACTUALLY NOT AT ALL.\nI THINK THAT THE MEDIA, I THINK HILLARY CLINTON, I THINK CLINTON\nSUPPORTERS, I THINK BERNIE SUPPORTERS, I THINK PEOPLE\nINDEPENDENTS AND THOSE WHO HAVEN'T DECIDED WHETHER THEY'LL\nENGAGE IN THIS ELECTION AT ALL YET BY VOTING HAVE IT RIGHT WHEN\nTHEY SAY THAT DONALD TRUMP IS A BIGOT.\nHE VERY WELL COULD BE RACIST. AND IF HE IS NOT A RACIST, HE\nPLAYS WITH -- HE PLAYS WITH FIRE.\nMEANING HE IS GOING -- HE IS -- HE IS -- HE IS LITERALLY\nATTACKING -- TACKING ON TO HIS CAMPAIGN, PRINCIPLES AND DOG\nWHISTLES THAT RACISTS LOVE TO HEAR.\nTHE FACT HE WAS ON WITH JAKE TAPPER AND ACTED LIKE HE DIDN'T\nKNOW WHO DAVID DUKE WAS, HE DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT THOSE OTHER\nGROUPS. >> HE LATER SAID HE COULDN'T\nHEAR AND HE DISAVOWS. >> I'M JUST SAYING.\nI WAS GETTING THERE. I JUST HADN'T FINISHED MY\nTHOUGHTS. THE ONLY THING I WAS GOING TO\nSAY IS WHILE HE SAID LATER, I REBUKE HIM, HE DIDN'T ACTUALLY\nSAY DISAVOW, HE SAID I REBUKE HIM, HE STILL STRUGGLED WITH IT.\nFOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE PAINFUL MEMORIES, WHETHER WE HEARD ABOUT\nIT IN HISTORY BOOKS, OR FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE WITH RACISM,\nWITH DEATH THREATS FROM WHITE NATIONALISTS, IT IS TROUBLING.\nAT THE VERY LEAST, KELLYANNE COULD ACKNOWLEDGE AND HIS\nSUPPORTERS CAN ACKNOWLEDGE HIS PLAYING WITH THIS FIRE IS\nTROUBLING. THAT IS WHAT MAKES DONALD TRUMP\nA BIGOT. >> SO JOHN, AS A TRUMP\nSUPPORTER, YOU HEARD WHAT ANGELA SAID.\nIT IS TROUBLING, HERE IS WHY SHE THINKS HE IS THAT.\nYOUR RESPONSE AS A TRUMP SUPPORTER?\n>> LOOK, DONALD TRUMP GETS CALLED A BIGOT EVERY SINGLE\nTUESDAY BY HILLARY CLINTON AND HER SUPPORTERS.\nSO USING THIS KIND OF LANGUAGE IS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT UNIQUE\nTO THIS CAMPAIGN. IT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR QUITE\nSOME TIME. THE TEMPERATURE IN THE ROOM IS\nVERY HIGH. I WANT TO GET BACK TO THE\nIMMIGRATION THING HERE FOR A SECOND AND TOUCH ON WHAT ANA\nSAID. TODAY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE DAY\nTHAT HILLARY CLINTON GAVE THIS SPEECH WHERE SHE ATTACKS HIM\nESSENTIALLY FOR BEING A JOHN BERCHER IN NEVADA.\nBY EVOLVING ON IMMIGRATION, HOWEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT,\nTHAT KIND OF MUDDIES THE WATER IN WHAT IS GOING ON.\nI KNOW A LOT OF JOHN BERCHERS, THEY'RE NOT IDEOLOGICALLY\nFLOPABLE. YOU CAN'T CALL HIM THAT IN THE\nSAME DAY. THEY'RE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.\n>> LET'S LISTEN TO WHAT KELLYANNE SIDE.\n>> I THINK THEY MADE A HUGE MISTAKE TWO, THREE WEEKS AGO\nWHEN OUR CAMPAIGN WASN'T DOING AS WELL, THEY MADE A HUGE\nMISTAKE BY NOT GIVING THIS POLICY SPEECHES, BY NOT VISITING\nTHE TROOPS ABROAD. SHE COULD HAVE PUT HIM AWAY AND\nFAILED TO DO IT. >> DO YOU AGREE, ANA, THAT SHE\nCOULD HAVE PUT HIM AWAY WHEN THE CAMPAIGN WASN'T GOING SO WELL A\nFEW WEEKS AGO? >> YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK\nANYBODY CAN PUT ANYBODY AWAY AT THIS POINT.\nLOOK, 2016 IS THE YEAR OF THE CRAZY, THE YEAR OF THE\nUNPREDICTABLE, WHERE THINGS CAN CHANGE ON A DIME.\nWE HAVE SEEN THAT. BOTH OF THESE PEOPLE, BOTH OF\nTHESE CANDIDATES HAVE GOT TO RUN UNTIL THE VERY END.\nTHERE IS NO SUCH THING AS PUTTING SOMEBODY AWAY, ONE OF\nTHESE CANDIDATES AWAY IN AUGUST. IT IS JUST, IT WOULD BE AN\nIRRESPONSIBLE WAY TO RUN A CAMPAIGN.\nI DO THINK THAT SOMETHING KELLYANNE SAID REALLY RANG TRUE\nTO ME WHEN SHE SAID THAT HE HAS BEEN TRAVELING WITH IMMIGRATION\nEXPERTS AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ARTICULATE THIS POLICY.\nIT IS INCREDIBLE TO ME. IT IS ABSOLUTELY FLABBERGASTING\nTO ME THAT A GUY WHO HAS BASED SO MUCH OF HIS CAMPAIGN ON\nATTACKING IMMIGRANTS, ON ATTACKING HISPANICS, ON THE\nIMMIGRATION ISSUE, IT HAS BEEN A PILLAR, THE BUILD THE WALL THING\nHAS BEEN A PILLAR SINCE DAY ONE AND 75 DAYS OUT, HE IS STILL\nTRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE POLICY. I MEAN, THAT IS JUST, YOU KNOW,\nMIND-BLOWING. I DO THINK WHAT HE IS TRYING TO\nDO IS FIGURE OUT HOW TO ARTICULATE IT IN A WAY SO HE\nDOESN'T ANTAGONIZE THAT HE WON WITH THE BUILD THE WALL CHANT\nBUT TRY TO PERSUADE FOLKS WHO MAY STILL BE PERSUADABLE AND NOT\nA VERY BIG UNIVERSE, THAT HE IS NOT A RACIST WHO WANTS TO ROUND\nEVERYBODY UP AND DEPORT THEM. >> IMPORTANT DEBATE.\nI WISH WE HAD MORE TIME. THANK YOU ALL, JOHN, ANA, AND\nANGELA.",

THEY WANT TOUGHNESS.\nTHEY WANT FIRMNESS. THEY WANT TO OBEY THE LAW.\nBUT, BUT THEY FEEL THAT THROWING THEM OUT AS A WHOLE FAMILY WHEN\nTHEY'VE BEEN HERE FOR A LONG TIME, IT'S A TOUGH THING.\n>> THAT'S RIGHT. AND THAT'S WHY HIS OPPONENTS,\nBOTH WITHIN HIS OWN PARTY AND IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, HAVE BEEN\nSAYING YOU CAN'T THROW OUT 11 MILLION PEOPLE.\nIT WOULDN'T WORK. IT WOULDN'T BE RIGHT.\nWELL, IT SEEMS DONALD TRUMP HAS COME AROUND.\nHE STILL WANTS TO BUILD HIS WALL.\nHE STILL SAYS SOMEHOW MEXICO GOING TO PAY FOR IT.\nNOW A SOFTER STANCE ON ILLEGAL IMMI\nIMMIGRANTS. LET'S ASK CNN POLITICAL\nCOMMENTATOR MICHAEL SMERCONISH. GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE.\nFIRST, LET'S DEAL WITH HOW TO QUALIFY THIS.\nTHE CAMPAIGN IS GOING TO PUSH BACK.\nOH, IT'S NOT A FLIP-FLOP. HE HASN'T REALLY CHANGED.\nIT'S ABOUT EVOLUTION. HE'S LEARNING ON THE JOB.\nHOW DO YOU SEE IT? >> BY DEFINITION, IT IS A\nFLIP-FLOP BECAUSE HE SAID AT THE OUTSET, THE VERY FIRST SENTENCE\nYOU JUST PLAYED, HE SAID WE'RE GOING TO BE COMING OUT SOON WITH\nA DECISION. WHAT'S THE DECISION IF YOU'RE\nSTICKING TO THE POLICY THAT YOU'VE HAD THROUGHOUT THE COURSE\nOF THE WHOLE CAMPAIGN? AND CHRIS, ONE OTHER THING,\nBECAUSE I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU AND POPPY ALL MORNING LONG --\n>> HOW WE DOING? >> YOU'RE DOING TERRIFIC.\nLOOKING GREAT, BY THE WAY. BUT YOU'RE PLAYING THAT AUDIO OF\nJEB BUSH AND YOU'RE PLAYING THE AUDIO OF MARCO RUBIO.\nMAY I SUGGEST YOU ALSO THROW PRESIDENT OBAMA INTO THE MIX.\nBECAUSE THE FIRST PERSON THAT I THOUGHT OF WHEN I HEARD DONALD\nTRUMP SAY, WELL, WAIT A MINUTE, ARE WE GOING TO TEAR APART\nFAMILIES, ARE WE GOING TO UPROOT SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN IN THE\nCOUNTRY 10 OR 15 YEARS WITH A PRETTY CLEAN RECORD.\nWELL, THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT ARGUED WITH THE EXECUTIVE ORDER.\n>> AS WE HAVE THE CONTROL ROOM SCRAMBLING TO FIND THAT SOUND TO\nPLAY IT FOR OUR VIEWERS, LET ME ASK YOU THIS.\nTHE QUESTION IS, DOES IT BROADEN HIS BASE ENOUGH TO MAKE ANY\nDIFFERENCE, ESPECIALLY AMONG MINORITY VOTERS, OR DOES HE RISK\nJUST ALIENATING THE HARD LINERS, DOES HE RISK ALIENATING, YOU\nKNOW, THE CORE OF HIS BASE WHO FROM DAY ONE LIKED WHAT HE WAS\nSAYING ABOUT SANCTUARY CITIES AND UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS.\n>> LET ME ANSWER THE SECOND OF THOSE FIRST.\nTHE ANSWER IS NO WAY HE ALIENATES THAT HARD CORE\nCONSTITUENCY BECAUSE, POPPY, IN THE END, THERE'S ONLY ONE THING\nTHAT MATTERS TO THOSE PEOPLE, AND IT IS THAT HE'S NOT HER.\nTHE ANTIPATHY THEY HOLD FOR HILLARY CLINTON IS SUCH THAT\nWILD HORSES COULDN'T KEEP THEM AWAY FROM VOTING FOR DONALD\nTRUMP ON ELECTION DAY. NOW, TO YOUR FIRST POINT, I\nDON'T THINK THE INTENDED AUDIENCE ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR.\nI THINK THE INTENDED AUDIENCE ARE THOSE WHO ARE LARGELY\nREPUBLICAN, COLLEGE EDUCATED. >> SO TO MAKE THEM FEEL A LITTLE\nBETTER? LIKE MAYBE HE'S NOT RACIST LIKE\nWE THOUGHT PERHAPS HE WAS. >> EXACTLY.\nHEY, AT LEAST HE'S MAKING THE PITCH TO THE PEOPLE OF COLOR, TO\nMINORITIES AND SO FORTH IN THE SAME WAY THAT HE ASKED AND\nCOURTED AFRICAN-AMERICANS FOR THEIR VOTE LAST WEEK.\n>> MICHAEL, DOES HE TAKE A STEP FORWARD, PERHAPS, BUT THEN TWO\nBACK BY CALLING HILLARY CLINTON A BIGOT AND NOT OFF THE CUFF?\nSEEMED LIKE HE WAS READING IT OFF THE PROMPTER.\n>> WELL, THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING IN THERE, RIGHT.\nA LITTLE CHUM IN THE WATER FOR THE SHARKS.\nHE'S GOT A GOOD EAR. WHEN HE WORKED THAT CROWD, I\nTHINK IT WAS IN AUSTIN, TEXAS, LAST NIGHT.\nMY GOD, LIKE SEVEN TIMES HE ASKED THEM WHAT HE SHOULD DO.\nSO HE'S ALWAYS GOING TO GIVE A LITTLE SOMETHING TO THE BASE TO\nKEEP THEM ENERGIZED WHILE AT THE SAME TIME MAKING THE POINTS\nWE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING. >> LET'S LISTEN TO IT, FOR OUR\nVIEWERS WHO MAY NOT HAVE SEEN IT.\n>> HILLARY CLINTON IS A BIGOT. WHO SEES PEOPLE OF COLOR ONLY AS\nVOTES, NOT AS HUMAN BEINGS WORTHY OF A BETTER FUTURE.\nSHE'S GOING TO DO NOTHING FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS.\nSHE'S GOING TO DO NOTHING FOR THE HISPANICS.\nSHE DOESN'T CARE WHAT HER POLICIES HAVE DONE TO YOUR\nCOMMUNITIES. >> YOU SEE THAT WOMAN OVER HIS\nRIGHT SHOULDER, AND HE SAYS BIGOT AND SHE GOES --\n>> LIKE, DID HE GO TOO FAR? >> AND YOU KNOW WHAT'S\nINTERESTING ABOUT IT? IT'S JUST ONE PERSON, BUT\nSOMETIMES A PERSON CAN BE A METAPHOR.\nTHE REST OF WHAT HE SAYS, SHE'S NUMB TO IT.\nAND THAT'S THE CONCERN. WHEN YOU GO TOO FAR.\nWHEN YOU SAY SOMETHING SO UGLY THAT WITH THESE MORE\nSOPHISTICATED VOTERS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, THESE GOP COLLEGE\nGRADS, WHATEVER DEMOGRAPHIC YOU WANT TO PUT THEM IN, MAYBE HE\nWINDS UP HURTING HIMSELF MORE THAN HELPING HIMSELF WITH THE\nSOFTENING ON IMMIGRATION. >> BIGOT IS A VICIOUS WORD.\nIF YOU'RE GOING TO DROP THAT KIND OF A BOMB, YOU BETTER BE\nPREPARED TO BACK IT UP. HE'S GOT NOTHING.\nYOU HEARD A GUEST EARLIER TODAY THAT YOU ASKED TO JUSTIFY THAT.\nTHERE WAS NO ANSWER THERE. I REALLY THINK THAT'S BEYOND THE\nBOUNDS. YOU CAN CHALLENGE WHETHER\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS AS A WHOLE HAVE DONE BETTER ON A DEMOCRATIC\nWATCH, BUT TO USE THAT WORD, I THINK, IS JUST BEYOND THE PALE.\n>> AND QUICKLY, MICHAEL, SHE HITS THE TRAIL AGAIN IN NEVADA\nTODAY. SHE'S GOING TO MAKE A TOUGH\nSPEECH ON DONALD TRUMP. SHE'S GOING TO TIE HIM TO THE\nALT-RIGHT MOVEMENT. IT SEEMS LIKE INCREASINGLY, AND\nWE'LL SEE IT TODAY, THAT SHE IS PLAYING MORE BY THE TRUMP\nPLAYBOOK, IF YOU WILL. IS THAT SMART?\n>> WELL, IT WASN'T SMART FOR THOSE THAT HE RAN AGAINST IN\nPRIMARY SEASON. WHEN THEY STOOPED TO HIS LEVEL,\nTHEY CAME OUT WITH A LOT OF MUD ON THEIR FACES, AND HE ENDED UP\nBEING THE VICTOR. SO I THINK SHE'S GOT TO TREAD\nVERY, VERY CAREFULLY IN THAT REGARD.\n>> GOOD POINT. >> MICHAEL SMERCONISH,\nAPPRECIATE THE PERSPECTIVE AS ALWAYS.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT SMERCONISH SAID?\nTWEET US @NEWDAY, OR POST YOUR",

MR. LAVELLE, WHY IS THE CAMPAIGN\nCALLING HILLARY CLINTON A BIGOT? >> WELL, YOU KNOW, I CAN'T\nREALLY SPEAK FOR THE CAMPAIGN. I WILL TELL YOU THIS THOUGH.\nI REPRESENT THE NATIONAL DIVERSITY COALITION.\nWE REPRESENT ALL TYPES OF MINORITY GROUPS ACROSS COUNTRY.\nWE HAVE A PULSE OF WHAT GOES ON IN A LOT OF OUR COMMUNITIES.\nYOU KNOW, THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HILLARY TRYING TO\nDEFLECT OFF OF NOT, YOU KNOW, ADDRESSING HER OWN SITUATIONS AS\nIT RELATES TO HER E-MAILS THAT KEEP COMING UP.\nTHAT'S REALLY SUSPICIOUS. >> HOLD ON.\nJUST SO WE UNDERSTAND, IF WE'RE ON THE SAME THING, I'M NOT\nSAYING YOU SAID IT, BUT DONALD TRUMP, THE MAN YOU SUPPORT, JUST\nSAID HILLARY CLINTON IS A BIGOT. DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT?\n>> WELL, I MEAN, SHE HAS MADE STATEMENTS IN THE PAST THAT HAS\nBEEN, YOU KNOW, RACIST REMARKS AS IT RELATES TO ESPECIALLY THE\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, CALLING THEM SUPER PREDATORS AND\nTHINGS LIKE THAT. SO YEAH, THERE HAS BEEN SOME\nLEVEL OF, YOU KNOW, STEREOTYPES TOWARDS THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nCOMMUNITY, TOWARDS THE CLINTONS. >> DO YOU BELIEVE THAT SAME\nCRITICISM THAT MR. LAVELLE IS CHARGING TO HILLARY CLINTON CAN\nBE THE SAME THING SAID FOR DONALD TRUMP, BAKARI?\n>> WELL, I THINK SO. I THINK THAT DONALD TRUMP MAKING\nTHIS ARGUMENT ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON BEING A BIGOT IS ONE\nTHAT'S GOING TO FALL ON DEAF EARS IN MANY COMMUNITIES.\nI THINK WHILE DONALD TRUMP WAS BEING SUE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF\nJUSTICE NOT ONCE BUT TWICE FOR FAILING TO RENT TO PERSONS OF\nCOLOR, HILLARY CLINTON WAS ACTUALLY IN AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nCOMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH, INVESTIGATING\nDISCRDIS DISCRIMINATION IN OUR EDUCATION\nSYSTEM. SHE WENT TO SOUTH CAROLINA,\nWHERE I'M FROM, AND WORKED IN SOUTH CAROLINA TO TAKE YOUNG\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN MALES, JUVENILES, OUT OF ADULT PRISONS\nBECAUSE THEY WERE BEING RAPED, BEING BEATEN, ET CETERA.\nAND DONALD TRUMP HAS A LONG LINE OF INSTANCES, WHETHER OR NOT\nIT'S THE CENTRAL PARK FIVE OR THE BIRTHER MOVEMENT, WHICH\nCAUSED GREAT HESITATION. HE'S GOING TO HAVE A HARD TIME\nFLIPPING THAT SWITCH. I THINK DONALD TRUMP USED THAT\nINCENDIARY LANGUAGE SO WE DON'T HAVE TO DELVE INTO HIS POLICY\nTHAT'S GOING TO UPLIFT THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY OR\nANY MINORITY COMMUNITY FOR THAT MATTER.\n>> LET'S DO THAT RIGHT NOW. ON IMMIGRATION WE SAW A CHANGE.\nTHAT'S PART OF THE DIVERSITY COALITION'S PLATFORM.\nTHE DOWNSIDE IS HE CRUSHED PEOPLE IN THE PRIMARIES WHO SAID\nWHAT HE'S SAYING RIGHT NOW. HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THE THE TWO\nPOSITIONS, SIR? >> WELL, YOU KNOW, ONE THING\nABOUT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, IT IS A LONG PROCESS, AND YOU DO\nGATHER GENERAL CONSENSUS AMONG YOUR CONSTITUENTS AS WELL AS\nYOUR FAITH-BASED ORGANIZATIONS, YOUR MINORITY COMMUNITIES, AS\nYOU PROGRESS AND YOU GROW. CHRIS, YOU GOT TO REMEMBER, THIS\nHAS BEEN A MESS ON BOTH SIDES THAT HADN'T BEEN DEALT WITH FOR\nMANY YEARS THAT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME TO ADDRESS, YOU KNOW,\nA LOT OF FOLKS THAT CAME OVER HERE UNDOCUMENTED AND HAD\nFAMILIES AND IN THE SCHOOL AND EVERYTHING ELSE.\nIT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING\nTO HAPPEN OVERNIGHT. THIS AN EXAMPLE OF GOOD\nLEADERSHIP THAT I'VE BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG ON DONALD TRUMP'S\nABILITY TO HAVE, YOU KNOW, TO LISTEN AND TO UNDERSTAND.\nONE THING, TOO, THOUGH, DONALD TRUMP REALLY CARES ABOUT THE\nCOMMUNITY AND REALLY CARES ABOUT FAMILIES.\nTHIS IS SOMETHING THAT UNFORTUNATELY HAS BEEN GOING ON\nFOR SO MANY YEARS THAT'S BEEN NEGLECTED AND PUSHED BEHIND THAT\nEVERYONE IS WANTING TO HAPPEN OVERNIGHT.\nIT'S GOING TO BE A GRADUAL PROCESS, YOU KNOW, TO WHERE WE\nCAN GET TO A POINT TO WHERE WE CAN DEAL WITH THIS MESS.\n>> SO BRUCE LAVELLE IS MAKING POINT THIS IS ABOUT AN\nEVOLUTION, ABOUT TRUMP LEARNING AS HE GOES THROUGH THE PROCESS.\nBAKARI SELLERS, HOW DO YOU SEE IT?\n>> IT'S A FLIP-FLOP, PLAIN AND SIMPLE.\nI THINK THAT REPUBLICAN VOTERS, THEY BOUGHT A BILL OF GOODS,\nHOOK, LINE, AND SINKER. THEY WERE BAMBOOZLED.\nDONALD TRUMP STARTED WITH DWIGHT EISENHOWER'S OPERATION WETBACK,\nWHICH IS VERY BRUTAL. THAT'S WHAT HE PATTERNED HIS\nIMMIGRATION POLICY AFTER. NOW HE'S GETTING TO THE POINT\nTHAT MANY OF US WERE MAKING, EVEN YOU, CHRIS, PUSH BACK.\nWE REALIZED IT WAS POLITICALLY UNFEASIBLE, POLITICALLY STUPID.\nIT WAS TOO EXPENSIVE AND JUST INHUMANE.\nNOW HE'S GETTING TO A POINT WHERE JOHN KASICH, JEB BUSH, AND\nMARCO RUBIO ARE SITTING AT HOME SAY, THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN\nSAYING. NOW HE'S THERE.\nIT'S AMAZING WE WANT TO GIVE DONALD TRUMP CREDIT FOR SOMEHOW\nFINDING HUMANITY. I REFUSE TO GIVE HIM CREDIT AND\nSAY OVERNIGHT HE JUST QUOTE/UNQUOTE FOUND HUMANITY.\n>>LET PUT UP THE STATEMENTS FROM THE TWO CAMPAIGNS.\nWE HEARD FROM THE BUSH CAMPAIGN AND FROM THE CRUZ CAMPAIGN,\nTHEIR REACTION TO TRUMP CHANGING POSITIONS.\nHERE'S WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY. IT'S UNSURPRISING THAT DONALD\nTRUMP IS FINALLY FACED WITH RECONCILING HIS IMMIGRATION\nPOLICY WITH REALITY, SOMETHING GOVERNOR BUSH PREDICTED LAST\nYEAR. AND FROM THE CRUZ CAMPAIGN, THEY\nSAID, IT VINDICATES THE SPEECH, REFERRING TO WHAT HE DID AT THE\nCONVENTION, WHICH SEEMED TO BE A LUKEWARM AT BEST EMBRACE OF THE\nTHEN-NOMINEE TRUMP. IT VINDICATES WHAT TED CRUZ\nWARNED WOULD HAPPEN DURING THE PRIMARIES.\nSO THE CRITICISM IS, WE TOLD YOU THIS GUY WOULD CHANGE AS SOON AS\nIT SUITED HIM IN THE GENERAL, AND THAT'S WHAT HE'S DOING NOW.\nFAIR CRITICISM, MR. LAVELLE? >> NO, I DISAGREE.\nYOU GOT TO REMEMBER THOSE WERE MR. TRUMP'S OPPONENTS.\nTHEY'RE STILL A LITTLE SOUR GRAPES GOING ON.\nHOPEFULLY THEY'LL COME AROUND, YOU KNOW, MORE EFFECTIVELY TO\nHELP US GROW THE PARTY. I DISAGREE.\nIT'S LIKE I SAID BEFORE, WHEN YOU'RE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT,\nWHEN YOU'RE CAMPAIGNING, TRAVELING FROM ALL OVER THE\nCOUNTRY AND YOU'RE GETTING INFORMATION FROM A LOT OF --\nLIKE I SAID, FROM YOUR FAITH-BASED ORGANIZATIONS.\nMR. TRUMP HAS MET WITH A LOT OF FAITH-BASED PASTORS FOR MANY\nYEARS AND GATHERED INFORMATION. IT'S QUITE NATURAL TO LEARN,\nLISTEN, YOU GOT TO REMEMBER, GUYS, THE PRESIDENT WORKS FOR\nTHE PEOPLE. YOU LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE AS YOU\nGO. I DISAGREE WITH THAT, SIR.\n>> AND LET ME GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO TALK POLICY.\nWHAT IS MR. TRUMP OFFERING MEMBERS OF THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nCOMMUNITY ACROSS THE SPECTRUM? BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN'T\nDESCRIBE AFRICAN-AMERICANS AS ALL LIVING IN THE GHETTO WHO GET\nSHOT WHEN THEY WALK DOWN THE STREET.\nSO WHAT IS THE RANGE OF POLICY PROPOSALS THAT HE HAS?\n>> WELL, I WILL TELL YOU THIS. IN TERM OF HIS SPEECHES, THE\nBOTTOM LINE IS, CHRIS, THAT A LOT OF THE COMMUNITIES ARE\nHAVING A TOUGH TIME THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING ON TV THAT HAS A LOT\nOF SITUATIONS GOING ON WITH WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN MILWAUKEE AND A\nLOT OF OTHER CITIES. THAT'S BEEN UNDER DEMOCRAT\nREGIME. THE DEAL HERE IS THAT, YOU KNOW,\nYOU GUYS HAVE HAD THIS FOR 60 YEARS PLUS.\nGIVE US A CHANCE AT THIS. GIVE US A SHOT AT THIS.\nIN TERMS OF MR. TRUMP'S CHARTER SCHOOL INITIATIVES THAT GO IN A\nLOT OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES, THAT COULD LIFT UP\nA LOT OF THESE SCHOOLS TO GET LOCAL CONTROL, TRADE SCHOOLS,\nAND A LOT OF THOSE SCHOOLS IN THERE.\nALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS THAT WILL REALLY IMPACT AND HELP THE\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY. >> MR. LAVELLE SWINGS A GOOD\nSTICK AT YOU, BAKARI SELLERS. A LOT OF THESE BIG CITIES HAVE\nBEEN DEMOCRAT RUN FOR DECADES AND THE STATUS QUO IS\nUNACCEPTABLE. WHY CONTINUE TO REWARD THE\nPARTY? >> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, THAT'S A\nRED HERRING. IT'S MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT.\nI THINK MR. LAVELLE KNOWS THAT AS WELL.\nIF WE WANT TO THROW OUT STATISTICS WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING\nTHE COMPLEXITY OF ISSUES OF POVERTY, THEN WE CAN TALK ABOUT\nTHE FACT THAT 95 OUT OF THE TOP 100 COUNTIES THAT ARE MOST\nIMPOVERISHED ARE IN RED STATES AND THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF\nIMPOVERISHED AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE IN THE DEEP SOUTH.\nYOU ASKED FOR A CONCRETE PROPOSAL.\nONE OF THE THINGS HILLARY CLINTON IS TALKING ABOUT IS\nTAKING 10% OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SPENDING AND\nINVESTING THAT IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE 20%\nPOVERTY FOR OVER 30 YEARS. IT'S CALLED THE 10, 20, 30 PLAN.\nSHE'S TALKING ABOUT IMPLEMENTING THAT.\nTHAT UPLIFTS 434 COMMUNITIES, DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN, BUT\nMANY OF WHICH ARE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR.\nTHAT'S A CONCRETE PLAN. I AM REALLY, REALLY TIRED OF\nDONALD TRUMP AND HIS SURROGATES UNABLE TO ARTICULATE TO YOU A\nPLAN ON WHICH THEY'RE GOING TO DO ANYTHING.\nTHAT'S THE FRUSTRATING PART ABOUT THIS POLITICAL DEBATE.\n>> THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND MAKING THE CASE ON BOTH SIDES.\nAPPRECIATE IT.",

I CAN'T GET INTO HER HEAD.\nTHIS IS A WOMAN WHO FOR THREE DECADES HAS BEEN ATTACKED\nCONSTANTLY BY OUTRAGEOUS CLAIMS. YOU KNOW, YOU HEARD THE\nFOUNDATION CALLED THE MOST CORRUPT INSTITUTION EVER BY\nDONALD TRUMP. THIS IS A FOUNDATION THAT HAS\nPROVIDED HIV DRUGS TO 12 MILLION PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD AND THAT\nHAS LOWERED THE PRICE OF MALARIA DRUGS.\nWHEN YOU GET THAT DAY IN AND DAY OUT, MY GUESS IS YOU PROBABLY\nPUT ON A COAT OF ARMOR THAT MAYBE MAKES IT HARD TO BE -- TO\nSAY I'M SORRY. >> THE QUESTION IS WHEN YOU WANT\nTO BE THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD, YOU ALSO NEED TO BE ABLE\nTO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS VERY CLEARLY AND YOU'RE GOING TO FACE\nA LOT MORE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS CORPS.\nFINALLY TO YOU, SHOULD SHE HAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE?\nIT'S BEEN 265 DAYS. SHE SAID LAST NIGHT TO ANDERSON,\nSTAY TUNED. SHE DIDN'T SAY YES, I'LL BE\nHOLDING A PRESS CONFERENCE. SHOULD SHE OPEN HERSELF UP MORE,\nCONGRESSMAN? DO YOU THINK AT THIS STAGE THAT\nWOULD BE BENEFICIAL? >> I THINK BOTH CANDIDATES\nSHOULD BE AS ACCESSIBLE TO THE PRESS AS THEY CAN BE.\n>> SO THAT'S A YES? >> I'D LOVE TO SEE HER DO MORE\nPRESS CONFERENCES. SHE'S AN ENORMOUSLY SMART WOMAN.\nSHE DOES GET ATTACKED DAY IN AND DAY OUT, BUT SHE'S AN ENORMOUSLY\nSMART WOMAN. WHEN SHE SPEAKS, SHE TALKS ABOUT\nTHE THINGS SHE'S GOING TO TO DO FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AS\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. WHEN DONALD TRUMP SPEAKS, WE GET\nTHINGS IT LIKE SHUT OUT ALL MUSLIMS AND LET'S BUILD A BIG,\nBEAUTIFUL WALL. I'M IN FAVOR OF THEM BOTH DOING\nMORE SPEAKING. >> ALL RIGHT.\nNICE TO HAVE YOU ON THE PROGRAM. CHRIS?\n>> ALL SIGNS POINTING TO TRUMP CHANGING HIS STANCE ON ILLEGAL\nIMMIGRATION. IT'S REALLY NOT A QUESTION.\nTHE QUESTION IS WHY. HE NOW ADMITS TEARING FAMILIES\nAPART WOULD BE A, QUOTE, TOUGH THING.\nTRUE, TO SAY THE LEAST.

YOU KNOW, SOMEONE WHO'S\nQUESTIONED THE CITIZENSHIP OF THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nPRESIDENT, WHO HAS COURTED WHITE SUPREMACISTS, WHO HAS BEEN SUED\nFOR HOUSING DISCRIMINATION AGAINST COMMUNITIES OF COLOR, IS\nSOMEONE WHO IS, YOU KNOW, VERY MUCH PEDDLING BIGOTRY AND\nPREJUDICE AND PARANOIA. >> Reporter: NOW, SPECULATION\nHAS BEEN WHIRLING FOR NEARLY A WEEK ABOUT JUST HOW FAR DONALD\nTRUMP IS GOING TO GO IN MODERATING HIS IMMIGRATION\nLANGUAGE AND HOW FAR HE'LL GO IN CHANGING HIS POLICY.\nWE'RE NOW LEARNING HE'S EXPECTED TO DELIVER AN ADDRESS ON\nIMMIGRATION NEXT WEEK IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA.\nTHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN THIS WEEK, BUT IT WAS POSTPONED.\nPOPPY? >> ALL RIGHT.\nBIG DAY AHEAD FOR THAT SPEECH NEXT WEEK.\nSARAH, THANK YOU SO MUCH LIVE FOR US IN TAMPA.\nALSO, HILLARY CLINTON IS NOW RESPONDING TO TRUMP'S\nIMMIGRATION FLIP-FLOP. SHE SPOKE WITH OUR ANDERSON\nCOOPER. THIS IS HER FIRST NATIONAL NEWS\nINTERVIEW IN NEARLY A MONTH. SHE TAKES ON A NUMBER OF TOPICS,\nINCLUDING THE E-MAIL SAGA THAT'S BEEN HAUNTING HER CAMPAIGN.\n>> ACCORDING TO \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" REPORT, YOU TOLD FBI\nINVESTIGATORS THAT FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE COLIN POWELL\nADVISED YOU TO USE A PERSONAL E-MAIL ACCOUNT.\nHIS RESPONSE TO THAT THIS PAST COULD WAS, QUOTE, HER PEOPLE ARE\nTRYING TO PIN IT ON ME AND SHE WAS USING IT FOR A YEAR BEFORE I\nSENT HER A MEMO TELLING HER WHAT I DID.\nDID YOU SAY THAT TO FBI INVESTIGATORS, AND IS SECRETARY\nPOWELL RIGHT? WERE YOU USING THIS PRIVATE\nE-MAIL SERVER PRIOR TO YOUR CONVERSATION WITH HIM?\n>> WELL, LOOK, I HAVE THE UTMOST RESPECT FOR SECRETARY POWELL.\nHE WAS INCREDIBLY GRACIOUS AND HELPFUL AFTER I WAS NOMINATED\nAND BEFORE I TOOK THE JOB. I APPRECIATED THE TIME HE TOOK\nWHEN I WAS PREPARING TO BECOME SECRETARY, AND I VALUED HIS\nADVICE. I'M NOT GOING TO RELITIGATE IN\nPUBLIC MY PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM.\nI'VE BEEN ASKED MANY, MANY QUESTIONS IN THE PAST YEAR ABOUT\nE-MAILS, AND WHAT I'VE LEARNED IS THAT WHEN I TRY TO EXPLAIN\nWHAT HAPPENED, IT CAN SOUND LIKE I'M TRYING TO EXCUSE WHAT I DID.\nAND THERE ARE NO EXCUSES. I WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT THE\nDECISION TO HAVE A SINGLE E-MAIL ACCOUNT WAS MINE.\nI TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT. I'VE APOLOGIZED FOR IT.\nI WOULD CERTAINLY DO IT DIFFERENTLY, IF I COULD.\nBUT OBVIOUSLY I'M GRATEFUL THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT CONCLUDED\nTHERE WAS NO BASIS TO PURSUE THIS MATTER FURTHER, AND I\nBELIEVE THE PUBLIC WILL BE AND IS CONSIDERING MY FULL RECORD\nAND EXPERIENCE AS THEY CONSIDER THEIR CHOICE FOR PRESIDENT.\n>> DONALD TRUMP IS NOW INDICATING HE WOULD ALLOW SOME\nILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TO REMAIN IN THE COUNTRY.\nEARLY ON DURING THE PRIMARIES, YOU WELL KNOW HE TALKED ABOUT 11\nMILLION UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS, THEY ALL HAVE TO GET OUT, THE\nGOOD ONES CAN COME BACK IN, IN HIS WORDS.\nHE'S NOW TOLD FOX NEWS HE WOULD WORK WITH PEOPLE IF THEY PAID\nBACK TAXES. HE SAYS THAT'S NOT AMNESTY, THEY\nWOULDN'T GET A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP.\nWHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT APPEARS TO BE QUITE A BIG SHIFT ON THIS,\nIF THIS IS HIS POLICY MOVING FORWARD?\n>> MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE COMMENT YOU JUST REFERRED TO WAS\nTHE THIRD DIFFERENT POSITION HE TOOK YESTERDAY ON IMMIGRATION.\nSOMEBODY HAS TOLD HIM, I GUESS THE LATEST PEOPLE THAT HE'S\nCONSULTING, HOW DAMAGING HIS STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN, HOW\nTERRIBLE HIS DEPORTATION PLAN IS, HOW OFFENSIVE HIS VIEWS ON\nIMMIGRANTS HAVE BEEN FROM THE VERY FIRST DAY OF HIS CAMPAIGN.\nSO HE'S TRIED TO DO KIND OF A SHUFFLE HERE, BUT I THINK WE\nNEED TO LOOK AT THE ENTIRE CONTEXT.\nWE NEED TO BELIEVE HIM WHEN HE BULLIES AND THREATENS TO THROW\nOUT EVERY IMMIGRANT IN THE COUNTRY.\nCERTAINLY WHEN HE CHANGES HIS POSITION THREE TIMES IN ONE DAY,\nIT SENDS A MESSAGE THAT IT'S JUST A DESPERATE EFFORT TO TRY\nTO LAND SOMEWHERE THAT ISN'T AS, YOU KNOW, DEVASTATING TO HIS\nCAMPAIGN AS HIS COMMENTS AND HIS POSITIONS HAVE BEEN UP UNTIL\nNOW. >> ALL RIGHT.\nVERY INTERESTING THERE. SO SOME PROGRESS IN TERMS OF HOW\nCLINTON WANTS TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATION OF THIS E-MAIL SERVER\nIN THE FIRST PLACE AND THEN SOME FINESSE POINTS ON POLITICS AS\nWELL. >> INTERESTING THE MOST CLEAR\nCOMMENT SHE'S MADE ON THIS E-MAIL SAGA IN 17 MONTHS WAS ON\nTHE PHONE. >> DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACTS, BUT\nDOES DEAL WITH HER PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY.\nLET'S BRING BACK SARAH MURRAY AND CNN POLITICAL ANALYST AND\nPRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN CORRESPONDENT FOR \"THE NEW YORK\nTIMES\" MAGGIE HABERMAN AND POLITICAL REPORTER FOR \"THE\nWASHINGTON POST\" PHILIP BUMP. LET'S BEGIN WITH IMMIGRATION.\nI UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE LIKE TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN THEY'RE\nGOING TO CRITICIZE A TRUMP POSITION BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW\nWHAT HE DOES WHEN HE GETS CRITICIZED, BUT HOW DO YOU LOOK\nAT WHAT HE'S DOING NOW WITH IMMIGRATION AS ANYTHING OTHER\nTHAN SOMEONE LIKE A KELLYANNE CONWAY OR OTHER PEOPLE SAYING\nYOU'RE LOSING BECAUSE PEOPLE THINK YOU'RE A BIGOT AND A\nRACIST ON IMMIGRATION, RIGHT OR WRONG YOU NEED TO SOFTEN AND\nSOUND LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE WHO'S BEING REASONABLE.\nSO NOW HE'S DOING THAT. >> CERTAINLY IN THE LANGUAGE HE\nIS DOING THAT. IT'S NOT JUST THAT HE CRITICIZES\nYOU, BUT HE'LL SAY, I DIDN'T REALLY SAY THAT BECAUSE WHAT HE\nSAYS IS SO VAGUE YOU'RE TRYING TO PIN HIM DOWN.\n>> HE SAID WE'LL WORK WITH THEM. >> NO, HE SAID WE'LL WORK WITH\nTHEM. HE SAID HE HEARS FROM PEOPLE\nAROUND THE COUNTRY WHO SAY, I'VE BEEN HERE 20 YEARS, ARE YOU\nGOING TO SEND ME BACK? THAT IS THE LANGUAGE OF PEOPLE\nWHO FAVOR NOT DEPORTING PEOPLE. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO GET AWAY FROM\nTHE FACT HE'S STOPPED TALKING ABOUT A DEPORTATION FORCE.\nTHAT WAS A BIG THING DURING THE PRIMARIES.\nHE STILL TALKS ABOUT A WALL. THIS WAS CERTAINLY A RHETORICAL\nSHIFT. I DON'T KNOW THAT IT UNDOES 15\nMONTHS OF COMMENTS. >> EVEN KELLYANNE CONWAY IN HER\nINTERVIEW HERE ON CNN SAID TBD TO DANA BASH WHEN PRESSED ON IT.\nI THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT WHETHER THIS BROADENS HIS\nBASE, OR DOES THIS ALIENATE HIS GO-HARD SUPPORTERS ENOUGH TO\nPUSH THEM NOT TO GO TO THE POLLS, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GO\nTO CLINTON, BUT NOT GO TO THE POLLS IN DROVES LIKE HE NEEDS.\nNOT TO MENTION IF YOU'RE MARCO RUBIO OR JEB BUSH THIS MORNING,\nYOU'RE ANNOYED. LET'S LISTEN TO HOW SIMILAR\nTRUMP SOUNDS TO THEM IN THE PRIMARY.\n>> IF YOU'RE A CRIMINAL ALIEN, NO, YOU CAN'T STAY.\nIF YOU'RE SOMEONE THAT HASN'T BEEN HERE FOR A VERY LONG TIME,\nYOU CAN'T STAY. I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING TO\nROUND UP AND DEPORT 11 MILLION PEOPLE.\n>> YOU COME OUT FROM THE SHADOWS.\nYOU RECEIVE A PROVISIONAL WORK PERMIT.\nYOU PAY TAXES. YOU DON'T RECEIVE FEDERAL\nGOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE. YOU LEARN ENGLISH.\nYOU EARN LEGAL STATUS, NOT CITIZENSHIP.\n>> THEY'LL PAY BACK TAXES. THEY HAVE TO PAY TAXES.\nTHE BAD GUYS ARE OUT OF HERE. NOW, THAT ONE WE AGREE ON.\nBUT TO TAKE A PERSON THAT'S BEEN HERE FOR 15 OR 20 YEARS AND\nTHROW THEM AND THEIR FAMILY OUT, IT'S SO TOUGH.\n>> CAN HE MAKE THIS WORK FOR HIM, PHILIP?\nCAN HE CONVINCE PEOPLE HE'S LEARNED, HE'S BEEN EDUCATED\nTHROUGH THIS PROCESS AFTER WINNING THE PRIMARY AND NOW HE\nHAS A MORE FULL PICTURE? >> I DON'T THINK HE HAS A CHOICE\nBUT TO TRY. IF YOU LOOK AT THE MOST RECENT\n\"WASHINGTON POST\"/ABC NEWS POLL, ONE-FIFTH OF REPUBLICAN MEN AND\nONE-QUARTER OF REPUBLICAN WOMEN THINK HE'S BIGOTED OR SEXIST,\nWHICH IS REMARKABLE. THAT'S WITHIN HIS OWN PARTY.\nCLEARLY WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO IS BRING THOSE REPUBLICAN BACK\nINTO THE FOLD. BY ECHOING SOMEONE LIKE A JEB\nBUSH, THAT SEEMS LIKE GENERALLY A GOOD WAY TO DO IT, BUT THE\nPROBLEM IS HE'S BEEN SAYING THIS FOR 15 MONTHS.\nHE'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR A LONG TIME.\nPEOPLE HAVE TO DECIDE IF THE 15-MONTH DONALD TRUMP IS THE ONE\nTO LISTEN TO OR THE TWO-MONTH DONALD TRUMP.\nI DON'T THINK THIS IS GOING TO HURT HIS CORE BASE OF SUPPORT.\nI DON'T KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE CONVINCED BY THIS\nLAST-MINUTE CONVERSION. >> IT'S AN OPEN QUESTION.\nLET'S BRING IN SARAH MURRAY. YOU SEE THE RESPONSE OF PEOPLE\nAT THE RALLIES. WHAT'S THE RISK?\nTHE RISK TO BEING REASONABLE, WHICH IS WHAT HE'S BEING ON THIS\nISSUE. IT'S WHERE ALL REASONABLE MINDS\nHAVE WOUND UP. YOU CAN'T DEPORT 11 MILLION\nPEOPLE. MAY NOT BE HUMANE.\nCERTAINLY NOT FEASIBLE. DOES IT ALIENATE THOSE WHO ARE\nHARD LINE TRUMP SUPPORTERS BECAUSE THEY LOVE WHAT HE WAS\nCALLING STRENGTH IN THE BEGINNING, THAT EVERYBODY'S GOT\nTO GO AND WE'LL GET THEM OUT, THROW THEM RIGHT OVER THIS BIG\nWALL THAT MEXICO IS GOING TO PAY FOR.\nHAVE YOU NOTICED ANY SOFTENING IN THEIR SUPPORT?\n>> WELL, I DON'T THINK IT ALIENATE THEM FOR TWO REASONS.\nONE, ONE OF THE PHENOMENONS WE'VE NOTICE ABOUT TRUMP\nSUPPORTERS IS HE TAKE ALL THESE DIFFERENT POSITIONS, HE'S VERY\nVAGUE. THEY SORT OF LOOK FOR THE POINTS\nTHEY LIKE AND THEY IGNORE THE POINTS THEY DON'T LIKE.\nTHEY SAY, NO, THIS THING DONALD TRUMP SAID ABOUT THE WALL,\nTHAT'S WHAT HE REALLY MEANS. AND HE'S JUST SOFTENING HIS\nLANGUAGE, BUT HE'S NOT SOFTENING HIS POLICY.\nTHE SECOND, IF YOU ARE A TRUE HARD LINE IMMIGRATION VOTER,\nYOU'RE NOT SEEING HILLARY CLINTON AND SEEING A BETTER\nALTERNATIVE THERE. YOU'LL STILL STAY WITH DONALD\nTRUMP. THE QUESTION IS NOT WHETHER HE\nLOSES THEM IN A FLOP TO ANOTHER CANDIDATE.\nTHE QUESTION IS WHETHER THEY DON'T SHOW UP IN THE SAME KIND\nOF FORCE HE WAS HOPING TO. I HAVE TO AGREE WITH PHILIP.\nAT THIS POINT, HE DOESN'T REALLY HAVE ANOTHER OPTION.\nHE NEEDS TO EXPAND HIS BASE OF SUPPORT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.\nTHAT'S THE MESSAGE HE'S GETTING FROM KELLYANNE CONWAY.\nTHIS IS ONE WAY FOR HIM TO TRY TO DO IT.\n>> SO LET'S TURN TO HILLARY CLINTON.\nBIG INTERVIEW WITH ANDERSON COOPER LAST NIGHT.\nSHE HASN'T GIVEN A NATIONAL INTERVIEW IN ALMOST A MONTH.\nSHE GAVE, ARGUABLY, HER MOST CLEAR, DIRECT I'M SORRY ANSWER\nTO THE E-MAILS. YOU JUST HEARD IT IN THE PIECE.\nSHE SAID, YOU KNOW, WHENEVER I TRY TO EXPLAIN, IT SOUNDS LIKE\nAN EXCUSE. SHE SAID, THERE ARE NO EXCUSES,\nI APOLOGIZE. IT HAS BEEN, WHAT, 17 MONTHS\nSINCE THAT PRESS CONFERENCE AT THE UNITED NATIONS.\nDOES IT MATTER NOW, OR IS IT TOO LATE?\n>> I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE HELPFUL TO HER AND HER\nCAMPAIGN AIDES IF SHE HAD SAID THIS A YEAR AGO, EITHER AT THAT\nPRESS CONFERENCE OR WHEN IT WAS REVEALED THAT THE FBI WAS\nLOOKING AT WHAT HAD HAPPENED WITH THE SERVER.\nAT ANY POINT PRIOR TO NOW. IT'S BETTER LATE THAN NEVER,\nOBVIOUSLY. I THINK WHAT HER FOLKS ARE L\nLOOKING TOWARD IS NOT JUST STAURCHING THIS AS AN ISSUE, BUT\nTHEY'RE LOOKING AT TRYING TO GET HER IN A CERTAIN HEAD SPACE\nHEADING INTO THE DEBATE. SHE'S GOING TO GET PUSHED ON\nTHIS AT THE DEBATE. THE MORE SHE CAN HAVE AN ANSWER\nTHAT SOUNDS BOTH CREDIBLE, AUTHENTIC, ACTUALLY CONTRITE\nWHEN SHE GETS PUSHED, BECAUSE TRUMP IS GOING TO GET IN HER\nFACE. >> SHE'S IN A LITTLE BIT OF A\nFIX ON THESE TYPES OF ISSUES. WE'RE SEEING IT WITH THE\nFOUNDATION E-MAILS. THE STANDARD IS NOT ILLEGALITY.\nIT'S SEMBLANCE OF IMPROPRIETY, AN OUTWARD APPEARANCE THAT MAYBE\nTHERE COULD BE A CONFLICT. THAT'S UNSATISFYING TO PEOPLE\nBECAUSE THEY WANT PROOF. THIS WAS WRONG, THIS WAS NOT\nWRONG. BUT THIS IS ABOUT APPEARANCES.\nAT THE SAME TIME, CLINTON KNOWS PEOPLE GO AFTER HER WITH UNIQUE\nZEAL. THESE FOUNDATION E-MAILS IS A\nGOOD PIECE OF PROOF OF THAT. YOU CAN'T SHOW QUID PRO QUO.\nYOU CAN'T SHOW THAT A LAW WAS BROKEN.\nYOU CAN'T SHOW THAT SOMEBODY GOT SOMETHING BECAUSE THEY GAVE\nMONEY TO HER OTHER THAN A MEETING THAT THEY PROBABLY WOULD\nHAVE GOTTEN OTHERWISE, AND YET DAYS OF COVERAGE.\nTHAT'LL LOCK A CANDIDATE UP. LOOK AT TRUMP.\nHE'S GETTING A TASTE OF THAT ON IMMIGRATION.\nHE FLIP-FLOPS LIKE THAT. >> YEAH, I MEAN, THE INTERESTING\nTHING ABOUT THE FOUNDATION IS THE NEW REPORT FROM THE AP\nREVEALS IS REALLY HOW D.C. WORKS, WHICH IS THE CLINTONS\nKNOW ALL THESE PEOPLE. THEY ALL GIVE MONEY TO HER\nFOUNDATION. A LOT OF THEM ARE INTERNATIONAL\nACTORS. A LOT OF THEM WANT TO DO\nBUSINESS WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT.\nIT'S THIS COZY D.C. INSIDER RELATIONSHIP, WHICH IS NOT\nILLEGAL. YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT.\nTHERE'S NO PROOF THAT ANYTHING ILLEGAL HAPPENED AND IT'S\nSOMEWHAT BEING BLOWN OUT OF PROPORTION.\nBUT IT'S ALSO WHAT PEOPLE HATE ABOUT D.C.\nONE OF THE CHALLENGES HILLARY CLINTON HAS IS SHE'S BEEN IN\nPOLITICS SO LONG, HAS SO MANY OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS --\n>> BUT IT'S A LENS ON HOW SHE WILL BE AS PRESIDENT OF THE\nUNITED STATES. >> THAT'S THE QUESTION IS RAISES\nFOR FOLKS. IS THAT THE SORT OF PERSON I\nWANT IN THE WHITE HOUSE. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY YES.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE SAY NO. PCHBLTS\n>> THANK YOU, GUYS. >> MAGGIE, SARAH.\nMR. BUMP, THANK YOU. IN FACT, STICK AROUND.\nWE HAVE MORE WE WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.\nLATER ON THIS MORNING, WE'LL TALK TO TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN\nMANAGER, KELLYANNE CONWAY. SHE'S IN THE NEWS A LOT.\nSHE'S TRYING TO SOFTEN THE IMAGE.\nSHE'S TRYING TO DO MORE THAN A CAMPAIGN MANAGER USUALLY DOES.\nWE'LL CHECK IN WITH HER AT 8:00.",

HE IS TAKING A HATE MOVEMENT\nMAINSTREAM, HE'S BROUGHT IT INTO HIS CAMPAIGN.\nHE'S BRINGING IT TO OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR COUNTRY,\nAND, YOU KNOW, SOMEONE WHO HAS QUESTIONED THE CITIZENSHIP OF\nTHE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT, WHO HAS COURTED WHITE\nSUPREMACISTS, WHO HAS BEEN SUED FOR HOUSING DISCRIMINATION\nAGAINST COMMUNITIES OF COLOR, WHO HAS ATTACKED A JUDGE FOR HIS\nMEXICAN HERITAGE AND PROMISED A MASS DEPORTATION FORCE IS\nSOMEONE WHO IS, YOU KNOW, VERY MUCH PEDDLING BIGOTRY AND\nPREJUDICE AND PARANOIA. >> DANA BASH, TO YOU FIRST.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK? >> LISTENING TO HILLARY CLINTON\nAGAIN, OBVIOUSLY I LISTENED TO IT LIVE, IT'S SORT OF\nCRYSTALLIZING IN MY MIND WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.\nSHE'S PREVIEWING A BIG SPEECH SHE'S GOING TO GIVE TOMORROW,\nWHICH THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS CALLING THE ALT-RIGHT SPEECH\nWHERE SHE'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT STEVE BANNON, THE NEW CHAIRMAN\nOF DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN, WHO RUNS OR RAN BREITBART MEDIA AND\nTALKING ABOUT ALL OF THE THINGS THAT SHE IS GOING TO POINT TO\nTHAT HE HAS SAID AND DONE THAT PUT HIM IN FROM HER PERSPECTIVE\nIN THE HATE GROUP CAMP AND OBVIOUSLY TAKE THAT A STEP\nFURTHER AND SAY THAT JUST PROVES THAT'S WHO DONALD TRUMP IS GOING\nTO BE. SO THAT'S WHAT THAT IS.\nBUT THEN KNOWING THE WAY DONALD TRUMP, IT'S BEEN ADVERTISED THAT\nCLINTON IS GOING TO GIVE THAT KIND OF SPEECH.\nAND KNOWING THE WAY DONALD TRUMP IS AND TAKES THINGS LIKE THAT\nPERSONALLY, THERE'S NO QUESTION IN MY MIND THAT'S WHY HE CALLED\nHER OR ONE OF THE REASONS HE CALLED HER A BIGOT TONIGHT, AS\nALMOST A PREEMPTIVE STRIKE OF WHAT SHE'S GOING TO SAY\nTOMORROW. >> MARK PRESTON, YOUR THOUGHTS?\n>> YEAH, IT'S A BRIDGE TOO FAR. IF DONALD TRUMP WANTED TO GO OUT\nAND BE CRITICAL OF HILLARY CLINTON OR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY\nSAYING THEIR POLICIES HAVE FAILED THE INNER CITIES AND THE\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES, PERHAPS YOU CAN MAKE THAT\nARGUMENT. PERHAPS HE CAN ADD SOME CREDENCE\nTO THE ARGUMENT. BUT WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN YOU GO\nTOO FAR AND USE INFLAMMATORY LANGUAGE LIKE THAT, EVERYTHING\nTHAT YOU'VE SAID BEFORE IS FORGOTTEN.\nI DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYONE THAT THINKS THAT HILLARY CLINTON\nIS A BIGOT. SOMETIMES A LITTLE LESS SAID IS\nA LITTLE MORE EFFECTIVE. >> LET'S TURN NOW AND TALK ABOUT\nIMMIGRATION. TRUMP, A MAJOR CHANGE IN HIS\nSTANCE ON IMMIGRATION. LET LISTEN.\n>> NO CITIZENSHIP. >> NO CITIZENSHIP.\n>> EVERYONE AGREE WITH THAT? ALL RIGHT.\n>> I'LL GO A STEP FURTHER. THEY'LL PAY BACK TAXES, THEY\nHAVE TO PAY TAXES. THERE'S NO AMNESTY AS SUCH.\nTHERE'S NO AMNESTY. BUT WE WORK WITH THEM.\nBUT WHEN I LOOK AT THE ROOMS AND HAVE I THIS ALL OVER, EVERYBODY\nAGREES WE GET THE BAD ONES OUT BUT WHEN I GO THROUGH AND I MEET\nTHOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ON THE SUBJECT AND I'VE\nHAD VERY STRONG PEOPLE, REALLY GREAT, GREAT PEOPLE COME UP TO\nME AND THEY'VE SAID, MR. TRUMP, I LOVE YOU BUT TO TAKE A PERSON\nTHAT'S BEEN HERE FOR 15 OR 20 YEARS AND THROW THEM AND THE\nFAMILY OUT, IT'S SO TOUGH, MR. TRUMP.\nI MEAN, I HAVE IT ALL THE TIME. IT'S A VERY, VERY HARD THING.\n>> SO THAT'S NOT SCRIPTED. HE'S FEEDING OFF THE CROWD\nTHERE. >> HE IS.\nAND ALSO THE WAY THAT HE AND HIS CAMPAIGN ORCHESTRATED THIS, THAT\nHE WENT ON HANNITY, HE WENT ON FOX, A VERY, VERY SAFE PLACE IN\nFRONT OF A CROWD THAT HE WAS FEEDING OFF OF, NOT HECKLING HIM\nFOR MOVING TO THE CENTER. MAYBE IT LOOKS LIKE JUST THE\nOPPOSITE. BUT TO HEAR DONALD TRUMP SAY\nTHAT HE UNDERSTANDS HOW TOUGH IT WOULD BE FOR ALL OF THESE\nFAMILIES WHO HAVE BEEN HERE FOR SO MANY YEARS TO LEAVE IS WHAT\nWE HEARD PEOPLE LIKE JEB BUSH AND OTHER -- AND JOHN KASICH,\nOTHER REPUBLICANS WHO GOT RIDICULED FOR SAYING THAT IN THE\nPRIMARIES SAY. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WHAT IS SO\nDIFFERENT FROM WHAT HE SAID TO YOU, TO ME, TO SO MANY PEOPLE\nWHO INTERVIEWED HIM THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE PRIMARY SEASON WHEN\nHE WAS VERY SPECIFIC, EVERYBODY HAS TO LEAD, THE GOOD\nONES, THE BAD ONES AND LET THE GOOD ONES BACK IN.\nTHAT'S NOT WHAT HE SAID. >> HERE IS MORE.\n>> WE'RE GOING TO THE FAMILIES TOGETHER.\nYOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A DEPORTATION FORCE AND DO IT\nHUMANELY. >> YOU'RE ROUNDING THEM ALL UP?\n>> IF A VERY HUMANE WAY AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE HAPPY\nBECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE LEGALIZED.\nI'M SURE THESE ARE VERY, VERY FINE PEOPLE.\nTHEY'RE GOING TO GO AND WE'RE GOING TO CREATE A PATH WHERE WE\nCAN GET THEM INTO THIS COUNTRY LEGALLY.\n>> MARK, MANY PEOPLE HAVE SAID WHAT HE WAS PROPOSING WAS NEVER\nGOING TO WORK, A DEPORTATION FORCE, BUILDING A WALL ACROSS\nTHE BORDER. YOU CAN'T PHYSICALLY DO THAT.\nAND NOW THIS IS CHANGING BUT MANY PEOPLE HAVE WANTED HIM TO\nCHANGE OR SOFTEN AS THEY SAY, HIS STANCE MONTHS AND MONTHS AGO\nAND NOW HE'S DOING IT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO MAY BE ATTRACTED TO\nTHIS, IS IT TOO LATE? >> A COUPLE OF THINGS.\nONE, WE COULD CALL IT A PIVOT, TWO, WE COULD CALL IT SOFTENING\nAND THREE, WE COULD SAY IT'S A FLIP-FLOP, AND WE WOULD BE RIGHT\nON ALL OF THEM. WE COULD CONTINUE ON.\nFOLKS WHO ARE WITH DONALD TRUMP RIGHT NOW, PERHAPS SOME MAY\nABANDON HIM, BUT WHO ARE THEY GOING TO SUPPORT?\nTHEY'RE NOT GOING TO SUPPORT GARY JOHNSON OR HILLARY CLINTON.\n>> DOES IT MAKE THEM LESS ENTHUSIASTIC TO GO TO THE POLLS?\n>> I DON'T THINK SO. I THINK DONALD TRUMP, THOSE WHO\nGOT ON THE TRUMP TRAIN FROM THE BEGINNING AND THINK HE'S GOING\nTO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. THEY'RE GOING TO SAY WITH HIM.\nBUT IT OPENS UP THE DOOR TO THOSE MODERATE, THOSE CENTRIST\nREPUBLICANS, THOSE SITTING ON THE SIDELINES, THOSE WHO THINK\nTHAT DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN TOO HARSH AND HIS RHETORIC TOO\nSHARP, AS WELL AS THOSE INDEPENDENT VOTERS IN THESE\nSWING STATES. WHILE WE USE THE WORD FLIP-FLOP,\nPIVOT, WHAT HAVE YOU, THEIR WORD WOULD BE, IT'S WELCOME.\nTHANK GOD THAT DONALD TRUMP IS FINALLY SAYING IT NOW.\nTHE QUESTION IS TO YOUR POINT, WHY WASN'T THIS DONE SIX MONTHS\nAGO? >> I THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY\nRIGHT, PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN HIS CORE SUPPORTERS DON'T HAVE\nANYWHERE ELSE TO GO AND THEY'RE GOING TO BACK HIM.\nTHIS IS NOW THE BIGGEST TEST TO THAT COMMENT HE MADE THAT HE\nCOULD SHOOT SOMEBODY ON 5th AVENUE AND PEOPLE WOULD STILL\nBACK HIM, BECAUSE THIS IS THE HEART AND SOUL OF HIS PRIMARY\nCAMPAIGN. THE WALL.\nAND THEN THE OTHER PART OF HIS IMMIGRATION PLAN WAS GET THEM\nALL OUT. THAT'S WHO DONALD TRUMP WAS TO\nTHOSE REPUBLICAN VOTERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, WHO WENT OUT BY\nMILLIONS TO SUPPORT HIM. >> MOST PEOPLE AT THE RALLY\nSAYING \"BUILD THAT WALL, BUILD THAT WALL,\" BUT WHERE ELSE DO\nTHEY GO. HERE'S WHAT HILLARY CLINTON SAID\nTO ANDERSON ABOUT THIS TONIGHT. LET'S LISTEN.\n>> MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE COMMENT YOU JUST REFERRED TO WAS\nTHE THIRD DIFFERENT POSITION HE TOOK YESTERDAY ON IMMIGRATION.\nSOMEBODY HAS TOLD HIM, I GUESS THE LATEST PEOPLE THAT HE'S\nCONSULTING, HOW DAMAGING HIS STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN, HOW\nTERRIBLE HIS DEPORTATION PLAN IS, HOW OFFENSIVE HIS VIEWS ON\nIMMIGRANTS HAVE BEEN FROM THE VERY FIRST DAY OF HIS CAMPAIGN.\nSO HE'S TRYING TO DO A SHUFFLE HERE.\nBUT I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE ENTIRE CONTEXT.\nWE NEED TO BELIEVE HIM WHEN HE BULLIES AND THREATENS TO THROW\nOUT EVERY IMMIGRANT IN THE COUNTRY.\nCERTAINLY WHEN HE CHANGES HIS POSITION THREE TIMES IN ONE DAY,\nIT SENDS A MESSAGE THAT IT'S JUST A DESPERATE EFFORT TO TRY\nTO LAND SOMEWHERE THAT ISN'T AS DEVASTATING TO HIS CAMPAIGN AND\nHIS COMMENTS AND POSITIONS HAVE BEEN UNTIL NOW.\n>> ARE YOU SAYING IT DOESN'T MATTER SO MUCH THAT HE'S GIVING\nHIS OPPONENT FODDER HERE? >> I DON'T THINK SO.\nNOT ON THIS ISSUE. HE IS FLIP-FLOPPING, HE CAN BE\nACCUSED OF THAT. HE CAN BE ACCUSED OF THAT ON\nMANY ISSUES THAT WE'VE SEEN SO FAR, BUT DO I THINK THAT, LOOK,\nHIS PLAN TO DEPORT 11 MILLION PEOPLE WAS ECONOMICALLY NOT\nFEASIBLE, LOGISTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE AND POLITICALLY\nSTUPID, RIGHT? IT WAS THOSE THREE THINGS THAT\nWAS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN. BUT FOR DONALD TRUMP, I BET\nTOMORROW OR IN THE COMING DAYS, HE WILL GO BACK TO SAYING WE'RE\nGOING TO GET THE BAD ONES OUT AND HE'S GOING TO BE LOUD ABOUT\nIT AND HE'S GOING TO BE VERY CRITICAL OF THE POLICIES UP TO\nTHIS POINT. BUT HE'S GOING TO SAY WE'LL GET\nTHE BAD ONES OUT AND KEEP THE GOOD ONES HERE AND IN THE END\nTHAT IS GOING TO PLACATE. >> DOES THIS WIN HIM ANY\nHISPANIC VOTERS, DANA? >> IT'S HARD TO SEE THE ANSWER\nBEING YES, BUT WE'LL SEE WHERE HE GOES WITH THIS.\nWE'LL SEE WHAT HIS POLICY LOOKS LIKE.\nWE UNDERSTAND HE'S GOING TO GIVE THAT SPEECH ON WEDNESDAY IN\nARIZONA, A STATE WHERE WE SHOWED IN OUR BATTLEGROUND STATE POLL\nTODAY THAT HE'S BEATING HILLARY CLINTON, SHOULD BE HISTORICALLY,\nBECAUSE SIT A RED STATE. BUT ONE THING ABOUT YOUR\nQUESTION, DON, ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT HE'S GIVING HIS OPPONENT\nFODDER. I AGREE WITH MARK.\nI DON'T THINK THAT'S THE ISSUE HERE.\nWHAT IS A LITTLE BIT PERPLEXING IS WHY THEY CANCELLED OR\nPOSTPONED THE SPEECH THAT THEY WERE GOING TO GIVE TOMORROW\nABOUT IMMIGRATION. THE POLICY WASN'T READY, FINE,\nTHAT'S COMPLETELY UNDERSTANDABLE BUT THE OTHER PLUS SIDE OF THAT\nWAS THEY COULD KIND OF LAY BACK AND LET HILLARY CLINTON STEW ON\nALL OF THESE STORIES ABOUT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION AND SO FORTH.\nINSTEAD IT'S KIND OF A DRIP, DRIP, DRIP AND IT GIVES HER\nTHE ABILITY TO SAY, WAIT A MINUTE, IS HER IMMIGRATION\nPOLICY THE SAME TODAY AS IT WAS YESTERDAY.\nSO IT'S MURKY FOR PEOPLE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HE STANDS FOR\nAND IT'S GOING TO LAST MORE THAN A WEEK.\n>> IS IT STEPPING ON THE NEWS CYCLE THAT WAS JUST SORT OF LAID\nOUT FOR HIM? BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON HAD THE\nE-MAIL, SHE HAD THIS SCANDAL, AND NOW EVERYBODY IS TALKING\nABOUT BIGOT AND HE'S FLIP-FLOPPING ON IMMIGRATION.\nSHOULD HE HAD JUST RIDDEN THE NEWS CYCLE?\n>> THREE WORDS FOR YOU, DON, YES, YES, YES.\nI CAN'T BELIEVE IT. >> YOU CAN'T BELIEVE THAT I'M\nRIGHT? >> BOTTOM LINE IS HE HAS STEPPED\nON HIS MESSAGE. HE HAS RAMPED UP INTO HILLARY\nCLINTON'S SPEECH TOMORROW, THE PIVOT IS GOING TO BE TO COVER\nTHE E-MAILS, COVER THE ONGOING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FOUNDATION.\nBUT NOW HER TIME WILL BE DIVIDED ABOUT DONALD TRUMP\nCALLING HER A BIGOT AND HILLARY CLINTON GOING BACK AT HIM AND\nPROBABLY SAYING THE EXACT SAME THING, PROBABLY IN SHARPER TONES\nTHAN WHAT WE HEARD HER SAY TONIGHT.\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, THEY ALLOWED THIS CLINTON FOUNDATION STUFF TO\nFESTER AND HE STEPPED ON HIS MESSAGE TONIGHT.\n>> THANK YOU. VERY FIRST TIME DANA BASH HAS\nBEEN RIGHT. THANK YOU, I APPRECIATE IT.\nWHEN WE COME BACK, DONALD TRUMP PROMISES VOTERS A HARD LINE ON\nIMMIGRATION. ISN'T THAT WHAT WON HIM THE\nNOMINATION?

THIS IS WHERE DONALD TRUMP,\nRALLY IS CURRENTLY UNDER WAY FOR HIM.\nTRUMP IS EXPECTED TO KEEP THE HEAT UP ON HILLARY CLINTON AND\nTHE CLINTON FOUNDATION AND HE MAY ELABORATE ON HIS IMMIGRATION\nPOLICY AND WHETHER IT COULD BE CHANGING.\nWE WILL BRING THAT TO YOU SHORTLY.\nWE WILL BE MONITORING THAT EVENT.\nJOINING US WITH INSIGHT ON WHAT WE EXPECT TO HEAR FROM DONALD\nTRUMP IS ONE OF HIS ADVISORS, DR. BEN CARSON.\nOF COURSE HE IS ALSO A 2016 REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATE. DR. CARSON, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT\nA NUMBER EVER THINGS INCLUDING DONALD TRUMP'S OUTREACH TO\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS. YOU HAVE TOLD ME A FEW DAYS AGO\nTHIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN WITHOUT DETAILS I THINK NOW WE\nUNDERSTAND THE DETAILS OF THIS. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT.\nBUT FIRST I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF DONALD\nTRUMP SOFTENING HIS PLAN TO DEAL WITH ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.\nCAN YOU GIVE US ANY DETAILS OR INFORMATION ABOUT HOW HE PLANS\nTO DO THAT? >> YEAH.\nWELL BASICALLY HE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING YOU REALLY\nHAVEN'T TRIED WITH SEVERAL ADMINISTRATIONS BOTH DEMOCRAT\nAND REPUBLICAN. THAT IS ACTUALLY ENFORCING THE\nLAWS THAT ARE ON THE BOOKS. NOW MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT JUST\nBECAUSE OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED WITHIN THE LAST FEW\nYEARS THAT IMBRAGS POLICY IS WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THE\nPRESIDENT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLICY IT\nFOLLOWS ON THE PURVIEW OF CONGRESS.\nTHEY ARE THE ONES WHO MAKE THE IMMIGRATION LAWS.\nTHE PRESIDENT'S JOB IS TO ENFORCE THEM.\nSO WE NEED TO GET BACK TO, YOU KNOW, THE WAY THINGS WERE\nORIGINALLY INTENDED. BUT LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS IF WE\nACTUALLY ENFORCE THE LAWS THAT ARE ON THE BOOK.\nAND IF THAT IS NOT ADEQUATE THEN YOU MOVE ON TO DO MORE THAN\nTHAT. >> SO WHICH LAWS?\nWHICH LAWS DO YOU ENFORCE BETTER?\n>> YOU ENFORCE ALL OF THEM. WE HAVE NOT BEEN ENFORCING THE\nLAWS. >> BUT HE SAYS LOOK, THERE'S A\nGRAP HERE. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS JUST\nBEING IGNORED. IS THERE SPECIFICALLY AN AREA\nBECAUSE WE ARE JUST TRYING TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF WHAT HE MAY\nDO.INSTANCES -- SORRY, GOOD ON.\n>> SPECIFICALLY WE. ENFORCE ALL OF THEM.\nTHAT'S VERY SPECIFIC. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED DO.\nWE HAVE NOT BEEN DOING IT. AND AGAIN, I'M NOT BLAMING ONE\nPARTY OR THE OTHER. >> CAN YOU GIVE AN EXAM EXAMPLE?\nDONALD TRUMP SAID HE LIKES -- HE SAID WOULD HE DO IT WITH MORE\nENERGY BUT HE LOOKED AT PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HIS\nDEPORTATI DEPORTATIONS AND COMMENDED HIM\nAT TIMES AND CRITICIZED HIM SAYING HE LACKED COMPASSION IN\nIT. >> WE NEED TO BE CONSISTENT.\n>> I'M NOT HEARING A SENSE FROM YOU OF WHAT HE WILL DO VERSUS\nWHAT IS BEING DONE NOW. >> WE WANT TO IMPROVE IN\nCONSISTENCY AND TREATING EVERYBODY EXACTLY THE SAME WAY.\nNOW I DON'T THINK THAT IT IS USEFUL TO PULL OUT ALL THE LAWS\nAND GO CHAPTER AND VERSE WHICH ONES ARE WE GOING TO ENFORCE AND\nWHICH ONES ARE WE NOT GOING TO ENFORCE.\n>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN TREATING EVERYONE THE SAME WAY.\nHE SEEMS TO INDICATE THAT HE WILL DEAL WITH WHAT HE SEES AS\nBAD GUYS FIRST AND THERE MIGHT BE A DIFFERENT OBVIOUSLY THAT\nWOULD BE A DIFFERENT PRIORITY. YOU'RE SAYING TREATING EVERYONE\nTHE SAME WAY. >> WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT BAD GUYS,\nYOU TALK ABOUT ALL THE BAD GUYS, ALL THE CRIMINALS.\nCERTAIN ONES DON'T GET ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THEY LIVE IN SAN\nFRANCISCO, VERSUS CARMEL, CALIFORNIA.\nTHAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. >> AND I HEAR YOU SAYING YOU\nTHINK IT ISN'T HELPFUL TO PULL OUT THE SPECIFICS.\nI DISAGREE WITH YOU ON THAT. I WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND THIS\nMORE. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD.\nI WOULD LIKE IT MOVE ON AND TALK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND HOW HE IS\nREACHING OUT TO AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS.\nSOMETHING GETTING A LOT OF ATTENTION.\nSOME PEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONED HOW GENUINE HE IS ABOUT THIS.\nYOU CAN SPEAK IT THAT AS WELL. CHARLES BLOW, NEW YORK TIMES\nCOLUMNIST IS SAYING LOOK HE IS DOING THIS DO APPEAL TO WHITE\nVOTERS WHO WANT TO SEE MORE INCLUSIVITY.\nHERE IS WHAT CHARLES SAID. >> THIS IS THE MOST HORRIBLE\nKIND OF BIGOTRY AND THE FACT THAT PEOPLE KEEP ASKING THE SAME\nQUESTION PARTICULARLY TO BLACK COMMENTATORS, LIKE ME, IS HE\nREACHING OUT TO BLACK PEOPLE. HE IS NOT REACHING OUT TO BLACK\nPEOPLE. THERE IS NOTHING ABOUT THIS\nAPPEAL THAT ANY RESIDENCE WITH ANYONE BLACK THAT I CAN FIND.\nI EVEN LOOKED AT THE LARGEST BLACK WEB SITES THAT I COULD\nFIND JUST TO SEE IF ANYBODY WAS TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY.\nNOT A SINGLE PERSON THAT I COULD FIND WAS TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY.\nONLY PEOPLE TAKING THERE SERIOUS SLI WHITE PEOPLE.\n>> OKAY DR. CARSON, I'M SURE YOU HAVE A REACTION TO THAT.\n>> WELL, YOU KNOW, I REALLY DON'T HAVE MUCH OF A REACTION TO\nIT BECAUSE YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHAT I WOULD EXPECT FROM CERTAIN\nPEOPLE. BUT YOU KNOW, HERE IS THE REAL\nISSUE. THE ISSUE IS THAT OUR CITIES,\nMANY OF OUR INNER CITIES ARE SUFFERING AND THEY'VE BEEN\nSUFFERING FOR SEVERAL DECADES NOW.\nDONALD TRUMP RECOGNIZES THAT IN ORDER TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT WE\nHAVE TO MAKE OUR INNER CITIES GREAT TOO.\nAND WE CAN'T CONTINUE WITH THIS SAME KIND OF POLICIES THAT HAVE\nLED TO DECREASED INCOME, HIGHER DROP-OUT RATES, MORE\nINCARCERATION, AND IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY 73%\nOF BABIES BORN OUT OF WEDLOCK. THESE ARE NOT THINGS THAT NEED\nSTRENGTHENING OF THE COMMUNITY, THESE ARE NOT THINGS THAT\nEMPOWER PEOPLE. THESE ARE THINGS THAT MAKE\nPEOPLE DEPENDENT. THOSE ARE ARE THINGS WE DON'T\nWANT. HE FULLY RECOGNIZES HE PROBABLY\nWON'T GET MAJORITY OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE, BECAUSE\nOF TRADITION. HOWEVER AFTER YOU ENACT THE\nRIGHT POLICIES AND PEOPLE SEE THINGS THAT ACTUALLY WORK, I\nTHINK PEOPLE WILL BE MORE INTERESTED IN WHO IS PROVIDING\nTHINGS THAT WORK THAN THEY ARE IN A PARTY.\nI THINK THAT WILL BE AN EXCITING TIME IN AMERICA WHEN THAT\nHAPPENS. >> YOU WILL BE INSTRUMENTAL IN\nTALKING TO HIM ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE PERSONALLY.\nYOU STARTED VERY HUMBLY AND HAVE BECOME A VERY, VERY ACCOMPLISHED\nNEURO SURGEON. I KNOW YOU WILL GIVE DONALD\nTRUMP A BIT OF A TOUR. YOU TALKED TO HIM ABOUT THIS.\nWHAT ARE HIS CURIOSITIES ABOUT TRYING TO UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE\nCHALLENGES THAT ARE FACING THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY AS HE\nLOOKS TO TALK MORE TO THEM. HE WILL MEET TOMORROW WITH\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN AND HISPANIC FELLOWS WITH THE RNC.\n>> WELL HE GETS VERY ANIMATED WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THIS.\nFROM THE VERY BEGINNING. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS VERY,\nVERY IMPORTANT TO HIM THAT WE DO THIS.\nAND THAT WE CREATE SUCCESS. NOT JUST FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS.\nNOT ANY ONE SPECIFIC DEMOGRAPHIC, BUT PUTTING\nTOGETHER THE RIGHT TOPICS. ONE OF THE THINGS HE WANT TO DO\nIS MEET WITH AFRICAN-AMERICANS FROM DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE\nCOUNTRY AND TO HEAR FROM PEOPLE WHAT ARE THE THINGS YOU'RE\nCONCERNED ABOUT AND WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE SEEN THAT\nHAVE WORKED. GIVE ME SOME DATA.\nGIVE ME SOME ACTUAL NUMBERS. AND LET'S MAKE SOME POLICIES\nBASED ON THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE KNOW\nFROM SOCIOLOGICAL STUD SEES THAT WHEN YOU BREAK HOMES APART, AND\nYOU RAISE CHILDREN IN THAT SITUATION, THEY DON'T DO AS\nWELL. SO LET'S LOOK AT POLICIES THAT\nTEND TO PUSH FAMILIES TOGETHER RATHER THAN TEAR THEM APART.\nLIKE MANY OF THE WELFARE POLICIES THAT GO ON TODAY.\n>> AND I HAVE TO ASK YOU ABOUT THIS HEALTH IB U.\nBOTH DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON, IT IS SO RARE THAT I\nTALK ABOUT THIS IN A POLITICAL CONTEXT AND I GET TO SAY YOU ARE\nA DOCTOR. SO PLEASE LET'S DISCUSS THIS.\nYOU ACTUALLY SAID THAT BOTH OF THEM AND THIS IS YOUR WORD YOU\nSAID THAT THEY ARE BOTH ELDERLY. AND YOU SAID THAT THEY SHOULD\nRELEASE THIS INFORMATION. THEY SHOULD RELEASE NEW MEDICAL\nRECORDS. WHY?\n>> BECAUSE AS PEOPLE AGE, AS YOU GET OLDER, IT BECOMES CRITICAL\nTHAT HAVE YOU AT LEAST AN ANNUAL EXAMINATION.\nBECAUSE A LOT OF THINGS BEGIN TO HAPPEN.\nAND THIS IS A JOB THAT IS VERY STRESSFUL.\nTHIS IS A 24/7 JOB. AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE\nA LOT OF STAMINA AND THE ABILITY TO PROCESS A LOT OF INFORMATION\nQUICKLY. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT\nBOTH CANDIDATE MEET THOSE QUALIFICATIONS.\n>> DR. BEN CARSON, REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BEING ON TODAY.\nTHANKS SO MUCH. >> THANK YOU.\n>> YOU WERE LOOKING NOW AT LIVE PICTURES WE ARE BRINGING FOUP\nTHIS IS A DONALD TRUMP RALLY ABOUT TO GET UNDER WAY IN TAMPA\nFLORIDA. WE WILL BRING THAT TO YOU WHEN\nHE STARTS SPEAKING. PLUS BERNIE SANDERS IS TRYING TO\nKEEP HIS POLITICAL REVOLUTION GOING.\nMORE ON THE NEW VENTURE THAT HE IS STARTING RIGHT AFTER THE\nBREAK.",

YOU WANTED TO COME ON AND TALK\nABOUT THIS ISSUE, ABOUT MALLAN YA TRUMP AND THE TABLOIDS, WHY?\n>> POLITICS IS A VERY TOUGH BUSINESS AND WHEN THE FAMILY\nGETS INVOLVED, YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD ON THEM.\nI THINK, YOU KNOW, IF SHE HAS THE RIGHT LIKE ALL OF US IN\nAMERICA DO TO DEFEND OURSELVES IF SOMETHING IS FALSE.\nCLEARLY THOUGH IF THIS IS TRUE THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR THE\nCAMPAIGN. AND THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO\nDEAL WITH IT. BUT I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO\nRECOGNIZE THIS, THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO DEFEND OURSES IF THESE\nALLEGATIONS ARE FALSE. >> SHOULD MELANIA TRUMP COME OUT\nAND PERHAPS TALK TO VOTERS ABOUT IT?\n>> WELL, I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS TO REMEMBER\nABOUT A CAMPAIGN AND TO REMEMBER ABOUT HAVING IMPORTANT SUR GATS\nIN YOUR CAMPAIGN AND THE SPOUSE IS ONE OF THEM.\nWHAT I HOPE DOESN'T HAPPEN FOR HER IS TO BE A TURTLE IN HER\nSHELL AND TO NOT BE OUT THERE TALKING, CONNECTING WITH VOTERS.\nIT'S AN IMPORTANT ROLE FOR THE SPOUSE.\nBUT THE OTHER THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT THE CAMPAIGN HAS TO GIVE\nTHE SPOUSE PROPER SUPPORT TO BE ABLE TO DO THE JOB, TO HELP THE\nCANDIDATE REACH EVERY POTENTIAL VOTER IN THIS ELECTORAL MAP\nWHICH IS GOING TO BE VERY DIFF\nDIFFICULT. >> DO YOU THINK THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN IS GIVING THE PROPER SUPPORT TO MELANIA TRUMP?\n>> WE SAW AN EXAMPLE IN CLEVELAND AT THE CONVENTION\nWHERE IT WASN'T.

BUSH IN SO MANY WAYS.\nI ASK YOU THAT QUESTION BECAUSE THERE WAS THIS ABC/\"WASHINGTON\nPOST\" POLL THAT CAME OUT THAT SHOWED JUST 39% OF ADULTINGS\nHAVE A FAVORABLE VIEW OF MELANIA TRUMP AND, AS YOU KNOW,\nMRS. BUSH WAS INCREDIBLY POPULAR.\nWHY DO YOU THINK THIS POLL IS SHOWING THIS ABOUT MELANIA\nTRUMP? >> WELL, BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW\nHER. CLEARLY WE CAN'T OBVIOUSLY MAKE\nCOMPARISONS HERE. ALL THE WOMEN THROUGH HISTORY\nTHAT HAVE FACED THIS ROLE, YOU KNOW, HAVE ALL HAD TO DEAL WITH\nSCRUTINY AND CRITICISM AND HAVE HAD TO TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\nWHO THEY ARE.

THERE'S NO GETTING AROUND IT.\nTHIS IS A TEAM EFFORT IN POLITICS.\nYOU HAVE TO DO YOUR JOB AND GET OUT THERE AND TALK ABOUT WHO YOU\nARE AND WHY THE PERSON YOU'RE MARRIED TO SHOULD BE THE\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. >> WELL, IT'S INTERESTING YOU\nSAY THAT BECAUSE I KNOW WHEN PRESIDE\nPRESIDENT BUSH'S CAMPAIGN WAS LAGGING IN 2004, LAURA BUSH HIT\nTHE TRAIL FOR HER HUSBAND, EVEN THOUGH IT WASN'T HER FAVORITE\nTHING, RIGHT? >> NO, IT WASN'T, AND SHE MADE\nTHAT VERY FAMOUS PLEDGE OR HAVE HER HUSBAND COMMIT TO HER SHE\nNEVER HAD TO GIVE A POLITICAL SPEECH WHEN SHE GOT OUT INTO\nTHIS IN 2000. SO SHE CAME ABOUT VERY SLOWLY\nBUT WAS AN EXCELLENT ADVOCATE AND SURROGATE FOR HER HUSBAND.\nIN 2004, WAS DEFINITELY AN INFLECTION POINT AND SHE WAS THE\nSECRET WEAPON, NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.\n>> I'M CURIOUS, DO YOU SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP?\n>> I HAVE TO SAY, I AM A REPUBLICAN AND THERE ARE A LOT\nOF PEOPLE IN OUR PARTY THAT I AM GOING TO SUPPORT ON THE DOWN\nBALLOT.

YOU LOOK AT, FOR EXAMPLE, THESE\nTRUSTWORTHINESS MEASURES AND DONALD TRUMP IS BASICALLY WHERE\nSHE IS ON THOSE MEASURES. SO THAT'S NOT GOING TO DECIDE\nTHIS ELECTION. I THINK THE PEOPLE HAVE MADE A\nJUDGMENT THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS IMPERFECT EFFECT.\n>> DAVID, ON TO THIS NEW CACHE OF E-MAILS.\nHILLARY CLINTON WAS ON JIMMY KIMMEL AND SAID WE RELEASED\n30,000, WHAT'S A FEW MORE. YOU THEN TWEETED THIS.\nYOU SAID THE WHAT'S A FEW MORE ON KIMMEL WAS A LITTLE OFF-KEY.\nWHAT SHOULD SHE HAVE SAID, DO YOU THINK?\n>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW, BUT I THINK SHE SHOULD NOT JOKE ABOUT\nTHIS. SHE HAS DONE THIS A FEW TIMES.\nSHE SEEMED FLIPPANT ABOUT IT. OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE CONCERNS\nABOUT THE -- HOW SHE HANDLED THESE E-MAILS, AND ALL THESE\nJOKES FALL FLAT. IT MAKES IT SEEM AS IF SHE IS\nNOT TAKING THE ISSUE SERIOUSLY. AND THAT ONLY EXACERBATES HER\nPROBLEM. SO THAT SEEMED LIKE A LINE SHE\nWAS WAITING TO DELIVER, AND WHOMEVER SUGGESTED THAT LINE DID\nHER A DISSERVICE. >> AX, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MAP,\nWE'RE SEEING THESE HOW DO YOU GET TO 270.\nDO YOU FEEL IT IS TOO EARLY FOR THAT?\n>> WELL, I THINK, YOU KNOW, LOOK, THERE IS A FUNDAMENTAL\nDYNAMIC BETWEEN REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS THAT YOU START WITH.\nDEMOCRATS, YOU KNOW, HAVE WON 242 ELECTORAL VOTES I THINK, SIX\nOUT OF SIX ELECTIONS, SO DEMOCRATS START WITH A BIG\nADVANTAGE, AND THEN YOU ADD THE TRUMP FACTOR AND HE IS IN A BIG\nHOLE. I DON'T THINK IT IS TOO EARLY TO\nHAVE THAT DISCUSSION. CAN THINGS CHANGE, YES, THEY CAN\nCHANGE. THE DYNAMIC IS PRETTY GRIM FOR\nHIM RIGHT NOW, BUT THESE DEBATES LOOM LARGE, AND IF HE COMES IN\nAND TURNS IN PERFORMANCES THAT CHANGE PEOPLE'S THINKING,\nPERHAPS HE CAN GET BACK IN THIS RACE.\nBUT I DON'T THINK IT IS TOO EARLY TO SUGGEST THAT HE HAS GOT\nA BIG HILL TO CLIMB. HE DOES HAVE A BIG HILL TO CLIMB\nHERE. >> THERE IS ANOTHER DYNAMIC HE\nIS TRYING TO CHANGE, THE OUTREACH TO BLACK AND HISPANIC\nVOTERS. THUS FAR, HE HAS MADE THE APPEAL\nIN FRONT OF WHITE AUDIENCES AT RALLIES IN WHITE NEIGHBORHOODS,\nHOWEVER, THAT'S CHANGING. IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS, HE\nIS PLANNING TRIPS TO URBAN AREAS, CHURCHES, CHARTER\nSCHOOLS, SMALL BUSINESSES, BLACK AND LATINO BUSINESSES.\nHE IS DEVELOPING AN EMPOWERMENT AGENDA BASED ON EDUCATION.\nCAN HE TURN IT AROUND? >> WELL, I THINK THERE TOO, HE\nHAS A BIG HILL TOO CLIMB. HE IS HOVERING BETWEEN 0 AND 1%\nIN MOST OF THE POLLS I'VE SEEN. AND THEY HAVE MARGINS OF ERROR\nOF FOUR, PLUS OR MINUS. HE COULD BE AT NEGATIVE FOUR IN\nSOME OF THESE POLLS. >> INTERESTING.\n>> I THINK HE HAS A BIG -- I WASN'T VERY GOOD AT MATH.\nHE HAS A BIG, BIG CHALLENGE HERE.\nONE OF THE CHALLENGES, AND I DID TWEET ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY AS\nWELL. THIS IS MY MAIN MODE OF\nCOMMUNICATION. >> TRUMP.\n>> I'VE LEARNED THIS FROM DONALD TRUMP, YES.\nYOU KNOW, HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO EXPLAIN IN THESE URBAN\nCOMMUNITIES WHERE HE PROMISES TO MAKE PEOPLE SAFE, WHY HE IS SO\nFUNDAMENTALLY UNWILLING TO CONSIDER ANY STEPS THAT WOULD\nPREVENT GUNS FROM FLOWING INTO THE COMMUNITIES, WHICH ARE SOME\nOF WHICH ARE WAR ZONES. PRIMARILY BECAUSE THERE ARE TOO\nMANY GUNS THERE. THEY'RE EASY TO ACCESS.\nAND SO THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES THAT HE IS GOING TO BE\nCONFRONTED WITH WHEN HE GOES INTO THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY.\nDONALD TRUMP'S BIG ENEMY WILL BE VIDEOTAPE.\nPEOPLE KNOW WHAT HE HAS BEEN SAYING FOR THE LAST YEAR, AND\nHE -- HE IS GOING TO BE MET WITH GREAT SKEPTICISM, WHETHER THIS\nLURCH IS GENUINE OR THE PRODUCT OF CONSULTATION WITH HIS LATEST\nCORE OF ADVISORS. >> DAVID AXELROD, THANK YOU.\nGREAT TO TALK TO YOU.",

SHE SAYS THE HOA HAS SPLIT INTO\nTWO PHASES AND THE ISSUE IS COMPLICATED.\nBOTTOM LINE IS WE HAVE -- WE HAVE NO SAY IN ANYTHING.\nIT APPEARS FAMILY MEMBERS ARE ON THE BOARD, NO MEETINGS.\nSO WHAT CAN WE DO? HOW DO YOU ANSWER?\n>> YEAH, YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY CALLED HER.\nWHEN I GET CERTAIN E-MAILS YOU CAN FEEL THEM REACHING OUT.\nSO I CALLED HER AND TALKED TO HER.\nLONG STORY SHORT, WHEN YOU -- THERE'S A DEVELOPMENT, AINSLEY,\nUNTIL THAT DEVELOPMENT IS COMPLETED THE DEVELOPER IS WHAT\nWE CALL THE DECLARANT. THEY LITERALLY -- THEY OWN --\nTHEY DO EVERYTHING WITH THE HOA. WHEN IT'S ALL FINISHED THERE'S A\nBOARD ELECTED. IT WAS SPLIT INTO TWO PHASES.\nI SAID, LOOK, YOU NEED TO GET A COMPETENT LAWYER TO LOOK AT\nWHAT'S GOING ON THERE, PUTTING FAMILY MEMBERS ON THE BOARD, THE\nOPTICS DO NOT LOOK GOOD. SHE'S MAKING PAYMENTS FOR TWO\nPHASES, NOT GETTING WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE GETTING AND IT\nGETS COMPLICATED TO WHAT POWERS THEY HAVE VERSUS WHAT THE\nHOMEOWNERS HAVE. I DIRECTED HER TO GET A\nCOMPETENT LAWYER, TO REALLY LOOK AT THIS COMPLICATED ISSUE THAT'S\nMUCH TOO DIFFICULT TO HANDLE OVER AN E-MAIL.\nBUT WHEN THE DEVELOPERS ARE DEVELOPING THE PROPERTY THEY ARE\nIN FACT THE HOMEOWNER'S ASSOCIATION.\nTHAT'S IMPORTANT FOR VIEWERS TO KNOW.\n>> MEANWHILE, BOB, I READ AND I LOVE YOUR BOOK, MY BROTHER IS A\nVICTIM OF IDENTITY THEFT. WHAT CAN PEOPLE DO TO PREVENT\nIDENTITY THEFT? >> YOU KNOW, GUYS, THIS IS GOING\nTO A LEVEL ANYMORE -- I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY PEOPLE I SEE\nAND HOW MANY PEOPLE E-MAIL ABOUT IDENTITY THEFT.\nFIRST OF ALL, IT'S ALWAYS HARDER FOR THE VICTIM TO FIX IT THAN\nTHOSE WHO STOLE. I SAID THIS BEFORE, CHECK YOUR\nCREDIT REPORTS EVERY SIX MONTHS TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS.\nIF THERE'S ANYTHING ON THERE THAT SHOULDN'T BE THERE ON\nTHERE. IF YOU TRAVEL LET YOUR CREDIT\nCARD COMPANIES KNOW THAT YOU'RE TRAVELING.\nI CHANGE ANY SECURITY CODES EVERY TIME I TRAVEL OUT OF STATE\nWITH MY CREDIT CARD SO THAT I KNOW AND I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH\nA RETAILER OR SOMEBODY HAVING TO CALL IN TO CHECK AND MAKE SURE I\nAM WHO I AM. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS, IF\nIN FACT YOU ARE A VICTIM, NOTIFY IMMEDIATELY YOUR BANK, YOUR\nCREDIT CARD COMPANIES, ALL PEOPLE THAT YOU HAVE EXTENDED\nCREDIT IN ORDER TO PROTECT YOUR POSITION.\nREVERSE THE IDENTITY THEFT, STEVE IS NOT EASY.\nIT'S VERY DILIGENT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO RUN AND GET A\nLAWYER, BUT MANY TIMES THAT'S HOW IT ENDS UP.\n>> HENRY LIVES IN MASSACHUSETTS -- OR I GUESS HE\nLIVES IN MASSACHUSETTS. OR MAYBE HE HAS A HOUSE IN\nFLORIDA AS WELL. BECAUSE HE SAYS WE LIVE ON A\nBEACH IN THE DIAMOND DISTRICT WHICH IS IN FT. MEYERS, FLORIDA.\nTHE HOUSE IS 115 YEARS OLD. WE HAVE FIXED IT UP TO MODERNIZE\nIT, AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO SELL IN ANY DIRECTION.\nMAYBE THERE'S A DIAMOND DISTRICT IN MASSACHUSETTS.\n>> REAL QUICK, YEAH, IT'S IN MASSACHUSETTS.\nI'M SORRY, I SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLEARER ON PARAPHRASING THAT\nE-MAIL. BOTTOM LINE IS WHEN YOU HAVE A\nHISTORIC HOME, YOU BETTER GET THE RIGHT REALTOR ON HOW TO MOVE\nTHE HOME. NEVER TOUCH THE OUTSIDE OF IT,\nTHAT'S THE HISTORIC PART OF IT. THIS IS A SPECIAL BUYER FOR A\nSPECIAL HOME. YOU HAVE TO STUDY THE AREA AND\nMAKE SURE YOU GET THE RIGHT REALTOR TO MARKET THIS TYPE OF\nASSET. >> ALL RIGHT.\nNOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE DIAMOND DISTRICT ON THAT STREET.\n>> YOU CAN SEE IT FROM HERE.",

DO WE REALLY THROW OUT\nLAW-ABIDING ILLEGALS THAT HAVE BEEN HERE FOR 10 OR 20 YEARS?\n>> THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO FOCUS FIRST AND FOREMOST ON A\nLAWFUL SYSTEM THAT PROTECTS THE INTERESTS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\nFIRST. IF YOU ENTER THE COUNTRY\nUNLAWFULLY YOU'RE SUBJECT TO BEING DEPORTED.\nWE HAVE LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN HERE A VERY LONG\nTIME. I THINK WHAT HE'S SAYING IS\nLET'S PROVE THAT WE CAN SUBMIT A PLAN THAT HAVE BEEN OFFERED OVER\nTHE YEAR, THAT THEY -- THEY HAVE GIVEN AMNESTY FIRST AND PROMISED\nENFORCEMENT IN THE FUTURE. HE'S SAY, LET'S FIX THIS PROBLEM\nAND THEN WRESTLE WITH THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN HERE A LONG TIME.\n>> YOU CAN GET ON BOARD WITH THAT?\n>> OH, YEAH, I CAN BE SUPPORTIVE OF THAT.\nYOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE WE HAVE THE RULE OF LAW.\nWE HAVE THE AMNESTY OF PEOPLE IN '86.\n>> ESSENTIALLY A WALL OF SOME SORT TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT, BUT\nTHEN THEY KEPT COMING IN. >> RIGHT.\nWE WENT FROM 3 MILLION ILLEGAL AT THAT AMNESTY TO 11 MILLION\nNOW. YOU CAN'T DO THAT IN THE FUTURE.\nIT'S NOT EASY. YOU'VE GET TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT\nHOW YOU HANDLE IT. WE HAVE TO WORK OUR WAY THROUGH\nIT. IT'S ESSENTIAL FOR AMERICA.\nI THINK DONALD TRUMP IS MOVING US IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.\nHIS -- IF YOU WANT TO SECURE THE BORDER AND IMPROVE OUR\nIMMIGRATION SYSTEM, FIX IT, THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO VOTE IN\nNOVEMBER. HILLARY CLINTON IS THE EXTREME.\nINSTEAD OF 10,000 REFUGEES FROM SYRIA, 65,000.\nSHE WANTS TO INCREASE THE IMMIGRATION ACROSS THE BOARD.\nAND HER POLICIES ACTUALLY UNDERMINE ENFORCEMENT.\nIT CANNOT WORK, SO THIS IS OPEN BORDERS REALLY VERSUS A REAL\nESTABLISHMENT OF LAW. >> WHAT I'M HEARING IS FOLKS WHO\nARE ALREADY HERE CAN STAY HERE. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEPARATE --\nSEND A MOM HOME AND KEEP THE CHILDREN HERE, AS LONG AS THEY\nPAY BACK TAXES AND YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO DEFINITELY ENFORCE IT\nIF THAT HAPPENS AND THEN BUILD A WALL TO PREVENT --\n>> LOOK, I THINK HE'S MENTIONED I'M GIVING YOU MY OPINIONS ABOUT\nHOW TO APPROACH THIS SERIOUS PROBLEM OF RE-ESTABLISHING THE\nLAWFUL SYSTEM OF IMMIGRATION AND THEN EVENTUALLY WE'LL HAVE TO\nDEAL WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN HERE A LONG TIME IN A DECENT AND\nFAIR WAY. >> OF COURSE, THE WHOLE THING,\nIF YOU COME INTO THE COUNTRY YOU HAVE TO SIGN THE GUEST BOOK.\nTHAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT IT IS. IT'S INTERESTING THOUGH, BECAUSE\nTHERE'S A SURVEY IF YOU WANT TO APPLY FOR CITIZENSHIP OR A VISA\nOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, AND THEY'LL ASK WHETHER OR NOT --\nTHE WAY IT WORKS RIGHT NOW THEY'LL ASK WHETHER OR NOT\nYOU'RE A WORLD WAR II NAZI OR A NAZI SYMPATHIZER.\nBUT THEY WON'T ASK YOU IF YOU'RE A MEMBER OF ISIS, AL QAEDA, ANY\nOF THOSE -- OF ABOUT A DOZEN DIFFERENT.\nTHERE'S THE APPLICATION RIGHT THERE FOR NATURALIZATION OF A\nDOZEN DIFFERENT TERROR GROUPS. THEY SAY YOU HAVE TO GO BEFORE\nCONGRESS AND CHANGE THE RULES. IT SEEMS KIND OF SILLY.\n>> WELL, IT DOES SEEM SILLY. I MEAN, A PERSON DOES NOT HAVE A\nRIGHT TO DEMAND ENTRY INTO THE UNITED STATES OR ANY NATION.\nI MEAN, NO NATION HAS TO TAKE SOMEBODY THAT'S DANGEROUS TO\nTHEM. PRESENTS A THREAT TO THEM OR\nCAN'T FLOURISH AND DO WELL IN THEIR COUNTRY.\nWE NEED TO EXAMINE PEOPLE WHO APPLY.\nWE HAVE MORE APPLICANTS THAN WE HAVE SLOTS FOR.\nAND WE SHOULD SELECT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST ABLE TO FLOURISH\nAND BE HAPPY IN THIS DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC THAT WE HAVE.\nNOT SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO COMPLETELY CHANGE THE\nCONSTITUTION AND LAWS OF OUR COUNTRY.\n>> YEAH. >> USUALLY AL QAEDA AND ISIS\nDON'T SAY, YES, I'M AL QAEDA AND ISIS AND PEOPLE AT GITMO DENY\nEVEN THOUGH WE HAVE THE INTELLIGENCE --\n>> YOU'RE SAYING THEY LIE ON THE APPLICATION?\n>> ABSOLUTELY. FIND OUT IF THEY'RE GOING TO\nSHOOT PEOPLE LIKE IN SAN BERNARDINO OR IN A SHAM MARRIAGE\nOR NOT. LET'S SWITCH GEARS, LET'S TALK\nABOUT HILLARY CLINTON. HER CAMP IS ASKING THE\nASSOCIATED PRESS FOR A RETRACTION AND AMENDMENT ON THE\nTWEET THAT SAID OVER THE COURSE OF TWO YEARS THAT THE -- OVER\nHALF THE PEOPLE THAT WENT TO VISIT HER HAVE SOME LINK WITH\nTHE FOUNDATION. THE A.P. SAID WE'RE NOT GOING TO\nDO THAT. THERE'S NOTHING INACCURATE IN\nOUR STATEMENT. >> THE A.P. IS NOT A RIGHT WING\nORGANIZATION, THEY'RE TO THE LEFT, SO THEY IDENTIFIED THE\nNONGOVERNMENTAL OFFICIAL SHE MET WITH, MORE THAN HALF OF THEM HAD\nGIVEN MONEY TO THE FOUNDATION. ANOTHER REPORT SHOWS THE\nFOUNDATION IS NOT SPENDING ITS MONEY WISELY.\nHUGE CHUNKS OF THE MONEY THEY SPENT ARE FOR SALARIES, TRAVEL,\nBONUSES, THOSE KIND OF THINGS. SO THIS FOUNDATION IS TERRIBLE.\nIT NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED. YOU CANNOT USE THE POSITION OF\nSECRETARY OF STATE TO SAY YOU CAN'T COME TO SEE ME UNTIL YOU\nHAVE GIVEN MONEY TO MY PRIVATE FOUNDATION.\nIT'S SO FUNDAMENTAL TO THE RULE OF LAW, RIGHT AND WRONG.\nI THINK IT RAISES LEGAL QUESTIONS THAT NEEDS TO BE\nWORKED ON. IT JUST CANNOT BE.\n>> SENATOR, BILL CLINTON WHO RUNS THE FOUNDATION OBVIOUSLY,\nHE DEFENDED IT OF COURSE. LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID AND THEN\nWE'LL GET YOUR REACTION. >> WE TRY TO DO GOOD THINGS.\nTHERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH CREATING JOBS AND SAVING LIVES.\nI DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. THE PEOPLE WHO GAVE THE MONEY\nKNEW EXACTLY WHAT THEY WERE DOING.\nI THOUGHT PEOPLE WERE CRITICIZING HILLARY FOR MEETING\nWITH MUHAMMAD EUNICE, AND I THINK IT'S ELECTION SEASON BUT I\nFEEL GOOD ABOUT IT. >> YEAH.\nTHEIR CHARITY ISN'T EVEN GRADED BY CHARITY NAVIGATOR BECAUSE OF\nSUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY OR HOW EVER THEY PUT IT FOR THE LAST COUPLE\nOF YEARS. IT LOOKS LIKE YOU PAY MONEY, YOU\nGET ACCESS, STUFF HAPPENS. >> THEN YOU HAVE THE PROBLEM IN\nHAITI. MANY OF THE PEOPLE ARE UPSET\nABOUT HOW LITTLE OF THE MONEY THEY THOUGHT WAS COMING TO HAITI\nRAISED FOR THAT PURPOSE APPARENTLY DIDN'T GO THERE.\nYOU CANNOT USE THE OFFICE LIKE THIS.\nTHIS IS A USE OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE.\nSOME SAY ACCESS IS NOT A QUID PRO QUO, BUT PEOPLE WANT ACCESS.\nTHE TOP AMERICAN LEADERS. YOU CANNOT BE BUYING ACCESS TO\nTHE AMERICAN LEADERS BY GIVING TO THE LEADERS' PRIVATE CHARITY.\n>> I AGREE. >> WHICH ENDS UP SUPPORTING\nTHEIR ENTOURAGE OF PEOPLE THAT ARE CLOSE TO THEM AND THAT MAY\nTURN OUT TO BE CAMPAIGN PEOPLE IN THE FUTURE.\n>> WELL, THE GOVERNMENT IS SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT ALL THE\nPEOPLE. THAT'S A POSITION WHERE SHE'S\nSUPPOSED TO REPRESENT EVERYONE, NOT JUST THE MILLIONAIRES.\nTHE ONES WHO HAVE THE MONEY TO BUY ACCESS TO HER.\n>> YOU'RE SO RIGHT ABOUT THAT. I WAS A FEDERAL PROSECUTOR FOR A\nLONG TIME. RUDY GIULIANI WAS. HE'S REALLY CRITICIZED THAT AND\nSTUDIED THE THE LEGALITY OF IT. BUT THE MAJOR POLITICAL OFFICE,\nTHE SECRETARY OF STATE, CANNOT BE PERCEIVED WORLDWIDE AS YOU\nGET -- IF YOU WANT TO SEE ME, YOU HAVE TO GIVE TO MY\nFOUNDATION. THESE PEOPLE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT\nTHE CLINTON FOUNDATION. THESE FOREIGN PEOPLE,\nBILLIONAIRES MANY OF THEM, WERE GIVING MONEY FOR ACCESS.\n>> JUST WAIT TILL SHE'S PRESIDENT.\nSENATOR, IT GOES TO THIS NARRATIVE WHERE WE NEVER GET THE\nWHOLE STORY. YOU TURNED OVER YOUR E-MAILS,\nREALLY? WE FOUND 14,900 YOU DIDN'T TURN\nOUT. YOU DIDN'T HAVE THINGS ON YOUR\nPRIVATE SERVER, YOU HAD THINGS THAT WERE CONFIDENTIAL, YOU HAD\nMORE THAN ONE DEVICE. SO EVERYTHING CREATES OTHER\nQUESTIONS AND HILLARY CLINTON ON SOME LEVEL FEELS AS THOUGH SHE\nDOESN'T HAVE TO ANSWER THEM BECAUSE SHE'S SO FAR AHEAD.\nBY THE POLLS INDICATE ARE THINGS ARE TIGHTENING UP.\nWHAT'S THE SENSE INSIDE THE TRUMP CAMP WHEN A FLORIDA POLL\nHAS IT NOW WITH TRUMP UP? >> WELL, IT'S A CAMPAIGN.\nMOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND THE NUMBERS ARE MOVING.\nFLORIDA HAS MOVED TO TWO-POINT TRUMP LEAD.\nUTAH HAS MOVED TO A DOUBLE DIGIT LEAD FOR TRUMP.\nARIZONA FIVE TO SEVEN POINT LEAD FOR TRUMP.\nTHESE ARE STATES -- SO IT'S MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION\nNATIONALLY. WHAT, UPI POLL, ONE POINT LOS\nANGELES TIMES HAS TRUMP UP TWO POINTS.\nSO THIS IDEA THAT THIS ELECTION IS OVER AND THAT HE'S NOT MOVING\nIN THE -- I HAVE TRAVELLED WITH HIM.\nTHESE CROWDS ARE FANTASTIC. AND THERE'S GOING TO BE A\nTURNOUT AND AN ENERGY LEVEL THAT SHE IS NOT COMING CLOSE TO\nMATCHING. I'M TELLING YOU, THERE'S ENERGY\nIN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN ACROSS THIS COUNTRY.\n>> IT'S HORSE RACE. SENATOR, THANK YOU FOR DROPPING\nBY. >> THANK YOU.\n>> NICE TO SEE YOU, SENATOR.",

FRANCE IS OFFICIALLY SECULAR\nAND FORBIDS DISPLAYS OF RELIGIOSITY AND MANY SAY IT IS\nRELIGIOUS GARB. BUT THE SWIMMER GOT ITS NAME\nFROM THE INVENTOR. I THINK IT IS TRUE.\nIT OPERATES ON SOCIAL MEDIA. ONE MAN TWEETED SAID 90 YEARS\nLATER AND WE ARE POLICING WOMEN ON WHAT THEY WEAR TO THE\nBEACH. WHAT IS GOING ON.\nSHE GOT A TICKET SAYING SHE WAS NOT WEARING AN OUTFIT\nREFLECTING GOOD MORAL AND SECULARISM.\nHOW IS THAT NOT ENFORCING DRESS CODES.\n>> I THINK IT IS A MISTAKE FOR THE EUROPEANS TO TRY TO DO\nTHIS KIND OF THING. THEIR PROBLEM IS THEY DON'T\nHAVE THE AMERICAN VERSION OF THE MELTING POT.\nTHEY ARE UNABLE TO INTEGRATE IMMIGRANTS INTO THEIR\nSOCIETY. IT IS A FATAL FLAW FOR EUROPE\nAS A WHOLE. I THINK WE DO IT BETTER\nALTHOUGH I WORRY THAT IN FACT WE ARE REACHING THE POINT\nWHERE IT IS NOT HAPPENING HERE.\nTHE FRENCH APPROACH IS WRONG. THEY JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE\nTO DO. >> IS IT BAD THEY ARE FORCING\nWOMEN TO WEAR IT? OR IS IT TWO SEPARATE THINGS?\n>> IT IS TWO SEPARATE THINGS. FOR ANYONE RELIGIOUS AT ALL IT\nIS A SCENARIO THAT CAN'T BE TAKEN LIGHTLY.\nI AGREE WITH YOU ABOUT THE WAY IT IS BEING HANDLED.\nI WAS SURPRISED IN THE RESEARCH TO FIND 15 TOWNS\nACTUALLY BANNED THE FULL OUTFIT I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE\nTHAT. I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE\nSEEN HOW THE SCENARIO PLAYED OUT.\nIT IS ONE THING TO GO UP TO SOMEBODY -- APPARENTLY THEY\nHAD HER STRIP DOWN WHICH IS UNACCEPTABLE.\nANOTHER THING TO PULL THEM OVER TO THE SIDE AND SAY IS\nTHERE A CAUSE. I DON'T KNOW THAT\nINFORMATION. NOT GOOD.\n>> CHRIS, ARE THE FRENCH OVERREACTING OR UNDER\nREACTING? >> I THINK THEY ARE\nOVERREACTING. YOU EITHER HAVE FREEDOM OF\nRELIGION OR YOU DON'T. THERE IS NO MIDDLE GROUND.\nIF THAT'S HOW SHE WANTS TO EXPRESS HER FAITH AND RELIGION\nTHAT'S HOW SHE DO IT. THEY MAY NEED TO REWRITE THE\nCONSTITUTION BECAUSE THAT IS IN THERE.\nI DON'T UNDERSTAND WHERE THIS COMES FROM AND WHY THEY NEED\nTO HARASS HER.

MYSELF INCLUDED.\n>> I CAN FIND MORE PEOPLE WEARING LESS CLOTHING THAT\nSHOULDN'T BE IN LESS CLOTHING.\nJUST BECAUSE IT IS A HEAT WAVE YOU DON'T HAVE TO DRESS FOR\nIT. >> THE WOMAN WHO INVENTED THE\nBURKINI, NOT BOB BURKINI, IS A A WOMAN WHO SAYS SALES OF THE\nBURKINI HAVE GONE WAY UP IN THE PAST PEW WEEKS.\nSHE IS -- THE PAST FEW WEEKS. SHE IS THE BIG WINNER.\n>> SHE POLLED SEVEN PEOPLE. >> ONE WAS ME.\n>> I'M ALL IN ON THE BURKINI. >> AMBASSADOR, YOU SAID\nSOMETHING I WANT TO MAYBE GO A LITTLE FURTHER WITH.\nI HAVE LONG BELIEVED THAT AMERICA DOES A BETTER JOB --\nYOU SAID ASSIMILATING AND INTEGRATING IMMIGRANTS THAN\nEUROPE DOES. YOU SAID YOU THINK WEA ARE\nLOSING THAT. >> YEAH, I THINK THERE IS A\nTENDENCY TO SAY WHAT GOES UNDER THE BANNER OF MULTI\nMULTI-CULTURALLISM AND PEOPLE SHOULDN'T BE IN THE MELTING\nPOT. AL GORE WAS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE\nOF THIS. HE SAID WHAT A WONDERFUL MOTTO\nEPLURIBIS-UNUM. IT IS OUT OF MANY.\nIT IS A STRENGTH WE TAKE PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD\nTO BECOME AMERICANS AND WHEN WE LOSE THAT THE COUNTRY -- I\nTHINK THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING IN EUROPE.\nTHEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THIS MASS OF IMMIGRANTS\nFROM NORTH AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST AND THEY ARE\nCOMING APART. >> WE SAID WE USED TO BE A\nMELTING POT AND NOW WE ARE THE SAME POT ON THE STOVE.\n>> THAT'S ONE WAY TO PUT IT. IT IS NOT A MUSLIM ISSUE.\n>> THANK YOU FOR DISMISSING IT.\n>> IT'S ALL RIGHT.

HISTORICALLY, WHEN A VACANCY\nCOMES LATE IN THE PROCESS -- IF SHE DOES WIN AND SHE NOMINATED A\nPERSON LIKE JUDGE GARLAND, I THINK CHANCES ARE, HE WOULD GET\nTHROUGH. THAT'S PROBABLY ABOUT THE BEST\nYOU COULD EXPECT. MR. TRUMP HAS GIVEN US A LIST OF\nNAMES LIKE BILL PRIOR, I WOULD LOVE TO SEE HIM ON THE SUPREME\nCOURT. THE COURT MATTERS, PROBABLY MORE\nON THE POLITICAL BASIS.

KEEP THEM TO CHECK AND BALANCE\nTO TRUMP OR CLINTON, HAVING A  WOULD MEAN A LOT WHEN IT COMES\nTO COURT CONFIRMATIONS. DONALD TRUMP HAS A GREAT LIST,\nBUT HE SUGGESTED NOMINATING HIS OWN SISTER WHO I OWE PPOSE WITH\nTHE EVERY BIT OF MY BEING. THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS,\nHILLARY CLINTON'S NOMINEES WILL BE DIFFERENT THAN A CONSERVATIVE\nWOULD MAKE AND THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO CONSIDER, BUT IT'S\nNOT THE ONLY REASON YOU VOTE FOR PRESIDENT.\nIT'S GOING TO BE THE OVERALL PACKAGE AND IF MR. TRUMP CAN UP\nHIS GAME, AND HE IS, HE'S DOING MUCH BETTER.\nIF HE CAN CONTROL THE GAP, I THINK THE CHANCE OF KEEPING THE\nSENATE GOES UP. IF HE CAN STAY ON MESSAGE,\nTHIS -- THIS CLINTON GLOBAL FUND THING IS A GIFT FROM THE\nPOLITICAL GODS. IT JUST REEKS OF WRONG.\nIT REEKS OF INSIDER BENEFITS. IT'S THE INSIDE VERSUS THE\nOUTSIDE, AND TRUMP REPRESENTS THE OUTSIDE AND HE'S IN A PRETTY\nGOOD SPOT IF HE CAN UP HIS GAME TO SHOW HE'S GOT THE JUDGMENT,\nTEMPERAMENT AND EXPERIENCE TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\n>> WE SAID THERE WAS NOTHING QUID PRO QUO, AND THEY SAID\nTHERE'S NOTHING ILLEGAL IN THE MIX HERE AND THAT FOUNDATION HAS\nDONE GOOD FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THINGS LIKE HEALTH ISSUES, HIV,\nHELPING OUT IN HAITI. WHAT'S THE ARGUMENT FOR CLOSING\nIT DOWN? >> YOU DON'T HAVE TO PICK\nBETWEEN HELPING POOR PEOPLE AND HAVING A SYSTEM YOU CAN BE PROUD\nOF. THE REASON THEY'RE PROMISING TO\nSHUT IT DOWN IN THE FUTURE, IF SHE WINS, IS BECAUSE THE AVERAGE\nAMERICAN DOESN'T SEEM TO BELIEVE THIS IS THE WAY THE SYSTEM\nSHOULD WORK. AT THE END OF THE DAY, THIS IS\nNOT THE WAY TO HELP THE POOR. AT THE END OF THE DAY, THIS IS\nINSETUOUS PRESIDENT OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE, THAT LOOKS\nBAD AT A VERY MINIMUM, AND WHY WOULD THE CLINTONS DO IT AND\nTHEY HAVE DODGED A THOUSAND BULLETS IN THEIR POLITICAL\nCAREER. SHE HAD A FRESH START AS\nSECRETARY OF STATE. SHE SETS UP A PRIVATE SERVER,\nTRYING TO HEAD THE WAY SHE DOES HER JOB NOT TO BE TRANSPARENT,\nWHICH COMES WITH THE JOB, AND BILL CLINTON IS RAISING MONEY\nFOR GOOD CAUSES BUT HE IS ALSO LIVING PRETTY DARN WELL OFF THE\nGLOBAL FUND, TRAVELING AROUND FIRST CLASS EVERYWHERE.\nI DON'T WANT TO BE LITTLE WHAT THE CLINTON INITIATIVE HAS DONE,\nBUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU CAN HELP THE POOR WITHOUT HAVING\nTHIS KIND OF SYSTEM AND THAT'S WHY THEY'RE PROMISING TO GET RID\nOF IT IN THE FUTURE, BECAUSE IT JUST DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.\n>> THAT IS THE SAME ARGUMENT THE BOSTON GLOBE MADE IN AN\nEDITORIAL JUST DAYS AGO, SAYING YOU CAN DO THESE THINGS AND MEET\nTHE GOALS OF THE FOUNDATION IF YOU'RE A DONOR, YOU MAY JUST\nHAVE TO DO IT SOMEWHERE ELSE.

LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID ON\n\"ON THE RECORD\" LAST NIGHT. >> SHE'S NOT THE HEAD OF FISH\nAND WILDLIFE. SHE IS THE SECRETARY OF STATE!\nSHE IS DEALING IN CLASSIFIED INFORMATION ON AN HOURLY BASIS.\nIT IS REASONABLE TO THINK THAT HER INFORMATION IS CHOCK-FULL OF\nCLASSIFIED INFORMATION. AND IT IS.\nAND IT WAS. AND THAT'S WHY WHEN SHE GAVE\nACCESS TO THOSE ATTORNEYS, BY THE WAY, THE I.T.

MELISSA: STEPHEN HAYES, HE MAY\nBE RIGHT, TO A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THIS ISSUE IS DEAD AS\nDOORNAIL. WHAT DO YOU THINK?\n>> TO A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE MEDIA THIS ISSUE IS DEAD AS\nDOORNAIL. THEY SHOULD BE PUSHING AS HARD\nAS THEY POSSIBLY CAN. IT IS BEYOND DISPUTE THAT\nHILLARY CLINTON LIED ABOUT EMAILS, ABOUT THE SERVER, WHAT\nSHE TURNED OVER AND SAID AGAIN AND AGAIN SAID THINGS THAT\nWEREN'T TRUE. WE FOUND WHILE CONGRESS HAS\nDONE, IN MANY CASES ITS LEVEL BEST TO EXTRACT INFORMATION FROM\nTHE STATE DEPARTMENT, FROM THE ADMINISTRATION, IT HAS BEEN\nUNABLE TO. SO WE HAVE GOTTEN GOOD\nINFORMATION FROM PLACES LIKE CITIZEN UNITED AND\n\"JUDICIAL WATCH\" AND OTHERS. EVERYBODY SHOULD BE TRYING TO\nGET MORE INFORMATION. SHE CLEARLY WILL NOT TURN IT\nOVER. REMEMBER BACK IN AUGUST OF 2015,\nSHE SIGNED A DOCUMENT UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY SAYING SHE\nHAD TURNED OVER NOT ONLY ALL WORK-RELATED EMAILS BUT ALL\nEMAILS THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE WORK-RELATED.\nWE HAVE THE FBI DIRECTOR SAYING THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF\nWORK-RELATED EMAILS THAT WERE NOT TURNED OVER.\nHE SAYS HE DOESN'T HAVE EVIDENCE THEY DID THIS INTENTIONALLY.\nMELISSA: RIGHT. >> WE KNOW THEY DIDN'T COME, WE\nSTILL DON'T HAVE EVERYTHING. WE OUGHT TO SEE IT.\nSANDRA: JASON CHAFFETZ WAS OUR ONE LUCKY GUY SITTING THERE, WHY\nDO REPUBLICANS NOT PICK THEIR BATTLES AND GO AFTER EVERY\nSINGLE THING? JASON CHAFFETZ RESPONDED, IT IS\nOUR JOB. IF I DIDN'T DO THAT I WOULDN'T\nBE HOLDING RIGHT PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE.\nTHERE IS SO MUCH NEWS EVERY DAY, THEY HAVE SO MUCH, THEY AS THE\nREPUBLICANS. WHY IS IT THEY CAN'T MAKE A\nCLEAR CASE AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON AND PUT IT IN FRONT OF\nVOTERS? >> I THINK A BIG PART OF IT\nJOURNALISTS ARE NOT INTERESTED. A LOT OF MAINSTREAM MEDIA\nREPORTERS, IT'S A COMPLICATED STORY.\nTHEY SORT OF SHRUG IT OFF AND THINK THEY KNOW EVERYTHING.\nTHERE WAS A REPORTER ON \"SPECIAL REPORT,\" WRITES FOR\n\"WASHINGTON POST,\" GOOD REPORTER, ANN GURIN AT BEGINNING\nOF THE YEAR WAS SICK OF EMAIL STORIES.\nTHINK OF WHAT WE LEARNED THEN FROM NOW AND MAINSTREAM\nREPORTERS WERE TIRED OF IT. MEGHAN: NOT WHETHER MAINSTREAM\nJOURNALISTS BEAD BORED. HOW DARE YOU.\nMELISSA: THANK YOU. MEGHAN: I'M SURE A LOT OF\nAMERICANS ARE SICK -- WANTING TO HEAR PARENTS OF BENGHAZI\nVICTIMS.

FOR INSTANCE, SHE SIGNED THAT\nDOCUMENT, OKAY? THERE SHOULD BE A PENALTY.\nIF YOU AND I SIGNED THAT SAME DOCUMENT, SAYING THAT WE WEREN'T\nGOING TO DO CERTAIN THINGS WITH CLASSIFIED INFORMATION UNDER\nPERJURY OF LAW, SO ON, SO FORTH, WE WOULD HAVE TO PAY A PENALTY.\nWHY IS IT THAT -- MELISSA: THEY ALWAYS GO TO\nINTENT.

ACCORDING TO THE CHICAGO COUNCIL\nON FOREIGN AFFAIRS 42% OF AMERICANS FEEL THE COUNTRY IS\nLESS SAFE THAN IT WAS BEFORE THE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON\nSEPTEMBER 11th, 2001. ONLY 27% FELT THAT WAY IN THE\n2014 SURVEY. THE SAME SURVEY FINDING THAT 89%\nBELIEVE TERRORISM WILL LIKELY BE A PART OF LIFE IN THE FUTURE.\nTHAT IS ALSO UP FROM A SIMILAR SURVEY DONE IN 2013.\nSTEPHEN, I TAKE SUBWAY EVERY DAY TO WORK, LIVE WAY DOWNTOWN OR\nMIDTOWN. EVERY TIME I GET ON SUBWAY I SAY\nA LITTLE PRAYER NOTHING WILL HAPPEN.\nTHAT IS THE WORLD I THINK WE LIVE IN.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK? >> I TAKE THE TRAIN FROM\nWASHINGTON, D.C. TO PENN STATION, THAT IS OBVIOUS.\nYOU GET A SENSE LOOK AROUND ON THE TRAIN.\nTHERE ARE BOMB-SNIFFING DOGS, THERE IS EXTRA SECURITY.\nHARRIS: THANK THE GOOD LORD. >> YEAH, EXACTLY.\nBUT I THINK THIS GOES IN PART TO POLICY, TO ADMINISTRATION\nPOLICY. IT EXPLAINS IT TO A CERTAIN\nEXTENT THE DISCONNECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FEEL WHEN THE\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SAYS, AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN,\nWE'RE WINNING. WE'RE AHEAD HERE.\nWE'RE MAKING PROGRESS. ISIS IS ON THE RUN.\nAL QAEDA HAS BEEN DEFEATED. PEOPLE DON'T FEEL THAT EVERY DAY\nIN PART BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY SEE AROUND THEM.\nTHEN YOU HAVE THESE RANDOM ATTACKS IN RANDOM PLACES.\nSOME OF THEM LONE WOLVES. SOME OF THEM WITH CONNECTIONS TO\nFOREIGN ENTITIES. THING WE'RE NOT TAKING MOST\nSERIOUSLY TO MAKE THIS IS DOWNER DISCUSSION IS POSSIBILITY OF\nANOTHER MASS CASUALTY ATTACK. HARRIS: LIKE ORLANDO.\nMELISSA: ABSOLUTELY. I'M A SMALL GOVERNMENT GIRL.\nI WANT MY GOVERNMENT TO DO VERY LITTLE.\nBASICALLY ONLY THING I WANT THEM TO DO IS NATIONAL SECURITY.\nTHEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE KEEPING CITIZENS SAFE AT HOME AND\nABROAD. KEEPING US SAFE FROM TERROR.\nKEEPING LAW AND ORDER ON THE STREETS.\nTHAT IS ONE OF THE FEW THINGS BETTER DONE ABOUT IT COLLECTIVE.\nTHEY ARE STRUGGLING TO DO IT RIGHT NOW.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY'RE MORE VULNERABLE THAN\nTHEY WERE BEFORE AND I'M AMONG THEM.\nHARRIS: EVERY TIME SOMETHING HAPPENS, THE PRESIDENT TALKS A\nLOT, A LOT OF TIMES IT TOGGLES THROUGH THE GUN CONTROL ISSUE,\nBUT WHEN IT DOESN'T GO THERE HE DOES NOT SAY WORDS I'M FEELING\nYOUR PAIN. I KNOW WHY YOU'RE FEELING AFRAID\nAND I GET IT. I WANT TO TELL YOU WHY YOU CAN\nSLEEP EASIER TONIGHT. I WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT I'M\nGOING TO DO.

THAT IS A MAJOR DIFFERENCE IN\nHOW WE SEE THE WORLD AND HOW WE SEE THE THREAT.\n>> REMEMBER IN THE DEMOCRATIC DEBATES THERE WAS A TIME WHEN\nBOTH BERNIE SANDERS AND HILLARY CLINTON WITH WERE ASKED TO NAME\nTHE TOP THREE PRIORITIES, THINGS THEY WOULD DO FIRST.\nNEITHER OF THE LEADINGANDIDATESD ANYTHING HAVING TO DO WITH\nNATIONAL SECURITY OR ISLAMIC TERRORISM.\nHARRIS: WOW. >> EVERY SINGLE REPUBLICAN WOULD\nHAVE HAD THAT IN HIS OR HER TOP THREE.\nHARRIS: 49% ARE NOT JUST PEOPLE IN THE DEMOCRATIC TENT.\nTHEY ARE A FEW OF THE POLES HOLDING UP THE TENT.\nTHEY'RE REALLY BELIEVE IT. MEGHAN: THERE IS RHETORIC,\nTALKING ABOUT HOW THE PRESIDENT SPEAKS BIT.\nI LOVE PRESIDENT BUSH, ONE OF THE THINGS HE USED TO SAY WE'LL\nSMOKE THEM OUT, GET THEM DEAD OR ALIVE.\nI LIKE A OLD SCHOOL COWBOY WAY WE'RE ANGRY AT THESE PEOPLE AS I\nAM.

JOINING US NOW TO TALK ABOUT\nTHIS, SIMON ROSENBERG, PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER OF NBA\nEND AND A FORMER BILL CLINTON CAMPAIGN ADVISOR, CHRIS\nWILSON JOINS US, CRUISE CAMPAIGN POSTER.\nGOOD TO SEE YOU BOTH. IT DOESN'T THAT DONALD TRUMP\nIS FOCUSING MORE OF HIS RHETORIC ESPECIALLY AT\nCAMPAIGN RALLIES ON HILLARY CLINTON.\nWE HEARD IT LAST NIGHT. THE EMAILS AND IMMIGRATION\nAND FOUNDATION AND SO FORTH. HE'S CALLED HER IN THE LAST\nSEVERAL WEEKS A LIAR, CORRUPT, CRIMINAL, CROOKED,\nYOU CAN PICK YOUR INVECTIVE . IS THAT A WISE STRATEGY?\n>> YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS IS YOU ARE SEEING AN EVOLUTION\nAND IT IS TEAM TRUMP 3.0 PLAYING THE HAND THEY'VE BEEN\nDEALT AS BEST THEY CAN WHICH IS THEY ARE TRYING TO GET HIM\nTO MAKE A CAMPAIGN ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON, TRIED TO\nSTAY ON TALKING POINTS SO THEY RECOGNIZE HE'S NEVER\nGOING TO START TALKING ABOUT IMMIGRATION SO THEY'RE TRYING\nTO GET HIM TO PIVOT AND MAKE IT MORE ABOUT STOPPING BAD\nGUYS FROM GETTING IN RATHER THAN ATTACKING IMMIGRANTS.\nTHEY HOPE THE MORE THEY CAN TALK ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON\nMORE THEY CAN MAKE A CAMPAIGN ABOUT HER AND THAT WAS THE\nCAMPAIGN OR IN PLAY THAN IT IS TODAY BECAUSE AS LONG AS\nIT'S ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND HIS STATEMENTS THAT TAKE THE\nSITUATION AWAY FROM HER IT MAKES THE RACE MORE DIFFICULT\nFOR TRUMP TO STAY COMPETITIVE .\n>> PRESIDENTIAL CHARACTER IS IMPORTANT.\nMAYBE HILLARY CLINTON DIDN'T BREAK THE LAW TECHNICALLY IN\nTHE USE OF HER EMAILS ALTHOUGH SHE CERTAINLY WASN'T\nHONEST ABOUT IT, DIRECTOR: SAID AS MUCH IN HIS TESTIMONY\nBEFORE CONGRESS AND BY THE WAY, TWO THIRDS OF AMERICANS\nTHINK SHE IS DISHONEST SO ISN'T TRUMP JUSTIFIED IN\nFOCUSING ON CLINTON AND HER CHARACTER?\nOF COURSE. IT'S AN ELECTION AND\nEVERYTHING IS FAIR GAME BETWEEN THE TWO CANDIDATES.\nI JUST DON'T THINK IT'S WORKING WELL.\nSHE IS FAR AHEAD IN THE POLLS RIGHT NOW, BY MORE THAN 10\nPOINTS IN KEY BATTLEGROUND STATES.\nMORE THAN 270 ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES.\nTHESE ARE TOUGH ROAD TO HO IN THE COMING MONTHS AND I THINK\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN THOUGH NEEDS TO RESPOND AND THEY\nNEED TO BE MORE AGGRESSIVE ABOUT PUTTING OUT POSITIVE\nMESSAGE THAT'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF A BUMPY.\nFOR CLINTON BUT WE'VE GOT A STRONGLY LEAGUE, SHE'S DONE A\nGOOD JOB IN THIS RACE BUT WE ARE UNDER NO ILLUSIONS THIS\nIS GOING TO BE AN EASY GAME THE REST OF THE WAY.\nGREG: SIMON SAYS IT'S NOT WORKING, MAYBE BECAUSE THAT'S\nIT RINGS HOLLOW WHEN DONALD TRUMP CALLS HILLARY CLINTON A\nLIAR. THE FACT CHECKER KEEPS A\nRUNNING TALLY ON FALSE STATEMENTS, THEY GET FOR\nPINOCCHIO'S TO HILLARY CLINTON, FIVE TIMES THEY GAVE\nDONALD TRUMP FOR PINOCCHIO'S FORETELLING WHOPPERS, 33\nTIMES. THE THREE PERCENT OF THE TIME\nTHEY SAY HE'S NOT TELLING THE TRUTH.\n>> THAT'S A CHALLENGE. I GET BACK TO THE WHOLE POINT\nOF WHAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS TRYING TO DO NOW IS TRYING TO\nGET HIM TO STICK TO TALKING POINTS AND USE TELEPROMPTER\nAND STAY MORE ON MESSAGE. THE MORE THEY CAN DO THAT AND\nGET HIM FROM SHOOTING FROM THE COP, THE MORE THEY ARE\nABLE TO STOP THOSE FACT CHECKER ISSUES FROM OCCURRING\nINTO HIS CAMPAIGN SPEECHES. THE CHALLENGE THEY'VE GOT IS\nJUST, IF YOU CAN'T SAY ON MESSAGE, IF YOU CAN MAKE THE\nCAMPAIGN ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON, IF HE CAN SOFTEN HIS\nRHETORICb& HE HAS MORE OF THE CHEST BESIDE THE POINT, DOES\nHAVE A LEAD AND TRUMP HAS DONE NOTHING SO FAR TO PROVE\nHE CAN STAY ON MESSAGE. IF HE'S ABLE TO IT TIGHTENS\nUP AND BECOMES A DIFFERENT ELECTION.\n>>. GREG: SIMON, ON IN THE\nIMMIGRATION DONALD TRUMP FAMOUSLY FOUND HE WAS\nABSOLUTELY GOING TO DEPORT EVERY SINGLE UNDOCUMENTED\nWORKER IN AMERICA. THAT WOULD MEAN ROUGHLY 11\nMILLION. HE REPEATED IT OVER AND OVER,\nEVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. NOW HE'S BACKING OFF ON THAT\nAREA HE'S VAGUE AND AMBIGUOUS AS TO WHAT HE MEANS NOW WHEN\nHE SAYS HE WILL FOLLOW THE LAW AND BE COMPASSIONATE AND\nSO FORTH BUT HOW IS THAT NOT A BLATANT, FLAGRANT\nFLIP-FLOP? >> IREALLY SPENT A LOT OF\nTIME TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HE'S BEEN SAYING OVER\nTHE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS . AND I THINK YOUR POINT, IF\nHE'S CHANGED HIS POSITION, THE CAMPAIGN NEEDS TO MAKE IT\nCLEAR WHAT HAS CHANGED FROM WHAT WAS A VERY EXTENSIVE\nPOLICY DOCUMENT THEY PUT OUT LAST YEAR.\nTHE SECOND POINT IS THAT THIS IDEA OF DEPORTING BAD GUYS\nFIRST, THAT AN OBAMA ADMINISTRATION APPROACH.\nWE STARTED THAT IN 2011. REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN AGAINST\nTHAT FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS SO THAT'S ACTUALLY A CHANGE.\nONE THING THAT WE KNOW HAS CHANGED IS HE IS EMBRACING\nPRESIDENT OBAMA'S STRATEGY, WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THAT AND\nTHIRD GIVEN HOW IMPORTANT HE SAID FOLLOWING THE LAW IS GOT\nTO COME CLEAN ABOUT HIS WIFE. THERE IS OVERWHELMING\nEVIDENCE THAT SHE BROKE THE LAW WHEN SHE CAME IN HERE.\nGREG: I'M SORRY, WILL BE",

TALKING ABOUT THE RIGGED SYSTEM\nIN WASHINGTON AND THEN TRYING TO BUILD UP THIS NICKNAME FOR\nHILLARY CLINTON, CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHE INTERESTING THING OF COURSE ABOUT TRUMP'S ARGUMENT ON THAT\nNOTE IS THAT AS KASEY TALKED ABOUT, THAT TRUMP HIMSELF GAVE\nTO THE FOUNDATION AND SAID HE GOT WHAT HE WANTED.\nHE HAS ADMITTED ESSENTIALLY THAT HE KNOWS HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS\nBECAUSE HE WAS PART OF THAT RIGGED SYSTEM.\nAND NOW HE SAYS, HE IS UNIQUELY QUALIFIED NOW TO TURN AROUND AND\nTO BREAK UP THAT RIGGED SYSTEM.

HE HIT IT VERY HARD YESTERDAY\nAND THE DAY BEFORE. WE EXPECT HIM TO DO THE SAME\nBEFORE IN TAMPA. >> THANKS SO MUCH.\nAND BEAUTIFUL CALIFORNIA. AND FOR MORE, LET'S BRING IN\nBRIAN FALLON.

THEY DID CHERRY PICK A CERTAIN\nSET OF DATA, THEY ONLY ARE LOOKING AT TWO OUT OF THE FOUR\nYEARS SHE WAS SKAIT. AND THEN THEY TOOK ALL THE\nMEETINGS SHE TOOK WITH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HERE IN THE\nU.S. AND FOREIGN LEADERS ABROAD, SOME 1,700 MEETINGS AND\nSUBTRACTED THEM OUT IN ORDER TO GET A HIGH PERCENTAGE NUMBER TO\nTRY TO SOUGHT THAT SHE HAD TOO MANY MEETINGS WITH PEOPLE THAT\nHAD SOME AFFILIATION WITH THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nBUT EVEN IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR ARBITRARILY SELECTED GROUP OF\nPEOPLE THAT SHE MET WITH AT THE AP LOOKS AT, THESE ARE PEOPLE\nTHAT ANY SKAIT WOULD HAVE MET WITH.\nFOR INSTANCE, MELINDA GATES WHO WITH HER HUSBAND BILL GATES RAN\nWITH HER HUSBAND. MELINDA GATES IS SOMEBODY THAT\nANY SECRETARY OF STATE SHOULD MEET WITH, THE GATES FOUNDATION,\nHAVING COVERED THE STATE DEPARTMENT, THE INTERNATIONAL\nREACH OF THE GATES FOUNDATION IS DOING WORK ON CONFRONTING GLOBAL\nHEALTH CRISIS. THE IDEA THAT MEETING WITH\nMELINDA GATES SUGGESTS SOMETHING UNTOUR IS FALSE AND SHOWED THE\nFLAWED NATURE OF THIS REPORT BY THE AP YESTERDAY.\n>> BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT IS ACCURATE TO TAKE THE\nNON-GOVERNMENT VISITORS AND TAKE A LOOK AT HOW MANY WERE DONORS.\nYES, YOU COULD SAY MELINDA GATES OBVIOUSLY LEADING\nPHILANTHROPIST, SOMEONE WHOSE DONE WORLD HEALTH WORK WOULD BE\nMEETING WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE, BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF\nOTHERS. THERE ARE PEOPLE LIKE THE\nUKRAIIAN BUSINESSMAN, WHO WAS AT A DINNER AT THE CLINTON --\nTHE STATE DEPARTMENT DINNER OR DINNER AT CLINTON HOME.\nTHERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE WHERE IT DOES LOOK LIKE THAT FIRE WALL\nTHAT SHE PROMISED, THE SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE\nWOULD NOT BE CROSSED. WAS CROSSED.\nTHE GATE KEEPERS WERE PEOPLE WHO WERE CLOSE AIDS.\nPEOPLE WHO -- ONE OF THEM WORKED PART-TIME FOR TANAIO WHILE HE\nWAS IN TURN GETTING ACCESS FOR SOME OF HIS CLIENTS.\n>> I JUST DISAGREE, RARND. LOOK, MOHAMED IS ONE OF THE\nOTHER PEOPLE NAMED IN THE AP REPORT.\nHE IS A NOBEL PRIZE WINNING ECONOMIST.\nHE HAS BEEN AWARDED THE CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL\nUNANIMOUSLY BY REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ALIKE.\nHE WAS AWARDED THE PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM BY PRESIDENT\nOBAMA. HIS WORK IS IN MICROLENDING TO\nENTREPRENEURS ACROSS THE DEVELOPING WORLD.\nTHIS IS EXACTLY THE TYPE THAT SHE SHOULD BE MEETING WITH.\nVICTOR IS ALSO SOMEBODY THAT TOP DIPLOMATS HERE IN THE UNITED\nSTATES HAVE MET WITH FOR YEARS BEFORE AND AFTER HILLARY\nCLINTON'S TENURE. LET'S GET TO THE HEART OF THIS.\nWHAT IS AT ISSUE IS A REPREHENSIBLE ATTACK ON A\nCHARITY, THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, THAT JUST SHOWS THE DOUBLE\nSTANDARD THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS BEING SUBJECTED TO HERE.\nYOU DID NOT SEE SIMILAR QUESTIONS RAISED OR ATTACKS\nLAUNCHED AGAINST GEORGE H.W. BUSH WHO LAUNCHED THE POINTS OF\nLIFE FOUNDATION AFTER HIS PRESIDENCY.\nNOT ATTACKS WAGED ON BOB DOLE WHO RAN FOR PRESIDENT IN 1976\nWHILE HIS LIFE WAS RUNNING THE INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS.\nAND RIGHTFULLY SHOW BECAUSE THESE ARE CHARITABLE\nORGANIZATIONS DOING IMPORTANT WORK.\nTHE IDEA THEY'D BE DRAG SBAD A POLITICAL BACK AND FORTH AND\nUSED AS WEAPONS IS COMPLETELY ABSURD AND BEYOND THE PAIL.\nIF YOU LOOK IN RECENT MONTHS AND YEARS, IT'S BEEN WIDELY PRAISED\nBY DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ALIKE FOR YEARS YOU HAVE THE\nLIKES OF JOHN McCAIN, CANDI RICE, JEB BUSH, CARLY FIORINA\nAND PRAISES AND SUPPORTING THE WORK OF THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nDONALD TRUMP DONATED $100,000 WHILE HILLARY CLINTON WAS\nSECRETARY OF STATE. LAST NIGHT HIS CAMPAIGN MANAGER\nSAID THAT THEY DID GOOD WORK. LET'S LOOK AT WHAT THE WORK\nIS -- >> IS IT TIME TO DISBAND IT?\n>> MORE THAN HALF THE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD RECEIVING AIDS DRUGS,\nRECEIVED THEM FROM THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nSOP NO, THE CLINTON FOUNDATION WILL NOT BE COMPLETELY\nSHUDDERING IT'S WORK EVEN IF CLINTON WINCE THE PRESIDENCY AND\nFOR GOOD REASON. THEY WANT TO CONTINUE THIS WORK.\nAND YOU KNOW WHAT, IF ANY AMERICAN VOTER IS TROUBLED BY\nTHE IDEA THAT CLINTONS TO WANT CONTINUE WORKING THE AIDS CRISIS\nON THE SIDE, THEN DON'T VOTE FOR HER, BUT I THINK MOST VOTERS ARE\nPRETTY REASONABLE ON THAT POINT. >> SHOULD THE CLINTON GLOBAL\nINITIATIVE BE SHUT DOWN, WHICH IS CORPORATE CONTRIBUTORS AND\nOBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT OF CROSSOVER BETWEEN CAMPAIGN\nCONTRIBUTORS AND CORPORATE CONTRIBUTORS THERE.\n>> ANDREA, THEY'VE SAID THAT CGI WILL HAVE IT'S LAST CONFERENCE\nTHIS COMING FALL, AND AFTER THIS YEAR THEY WON'T HAVE ANYMORE CGI\nCONFERENCES. LET'S LOOK AT WHAT CGI DOES.\nTHEY DO NOT DONATE FUNDS TO ANYBODY.\nTHEY BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. THEY BRING GOVERNMENTAL LEADERS,\nNONPROFIT LEADERS AND PEOPLE IN PRIVATE SECTOR SPACE TOGETHER IN\nORDER TONE COURAGE PRIVATE BUSINESS PEOPLE TO INVEST IN\nCHARITABLE WORK. IT IS THE POWER OF CONVENING TO\nGET THINGS DONE AND GET THINGS ACCOMPLISHED.\nTHE CGI CONFERENCE ITSELF DOES NOT DISPENSE FUNDS.\nSO THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO ALLEGATION HERE THAT HAS ANY\nMERIT IN TERMS OF THE CLINTONS AT ALL BENEFITTING OR PERSONALLY\nENRICHING THEMSELVES FROM THE FOUNDATION.\nNEITHER HILLARY CLINTON WHILE SHE WAS AT THE FOUNDATION NOR\nPRESIDENT CLINTON HAS EVER DRAWN A SALARY BENEFITTING FROM THE\nWORK OF FOUNDATION. BY CONTRAST, ANDREA, JUST TWO\nBLOCKS FROM 30 ROCK, THERE IS A BUILDING, A PROPERTY, ONE OF THE\nCROWNED JEWELS OF DONALD TRUMP'S BUSINESS HOLDINGS THAT PAYS HIM\nMILLIONS A DOLLARS A YEAR, AND HE OWES MONEY O THAN TO THE TUNE\nOF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS IT OF DOLLARS TO THE STATE-OWNED BANK\nOF CHINA AND GOLDMAN SACHS. TELL ME HOW HE'S GOING TO STAND\nUP TO GOLDMAN SACHS AND THE STATE-OWNED BANK OF CHINA WHEN\nHE RECEIVES FUND FROM A PROPERTY THAT HE OWES MONEY TO THEM TOO.\nHE, DONALD TRUMP, SHOULD SELL OFF HIS BUILDING AT 1296 AVENUE,\nHE SHOULD COMMIT TO THAT TODAY, AND UNTIL HE DOES, HE SHOULD\nSTOP RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT A CHARITY THAT DOES NOT HILLARY OR\nBILL CLINTON AT ALL BENEFITS FROM.\n>> AND ONE FINAL QUESTION, WHILE I HAVE YOU HERE, IS HILLARY\nCLINTON, THERE WERE REPORTS THAT SHINT GOING TO GET HER\nINTELLIGENCE BRIEFING. HER FIRST OFFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\nBRIEFING THIS SATURDAY, CORRECT? >> I'M NOT GOING TO CONFIRM THAT\nWILL AS I SIT HERE RIGHT NOW. I CAN SAY THAT POST THE\nCONVENTIONS, BOTH HAVE BEEN OFFERED INTELLIGENCE BRIEFINGS.\nWE HAVE SAID THAT WE PLAN TO TAKE THEM UP ON THAT.\nI'M NOT GOING TO CONFIRM A PARTICULAR MEETING.\nTHIS IS SOMETHING I THINK IN GENERAL WE WILL NOT APPROACH\nWITH GREAT FANFARE AND A FORMER MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE IS\nWELL-VERSED IN THESE MATTERS. WE'LL APPROACH THIS FAIRLY\nQUIETLY, BUT YES, I EXPECT SHE'LL GO THROUGH THE PROCESS AS\nEVERY NOMINEE DOES. >> AND AT SOME POINT VERY SOON.\n>> I'LL LEAVE THAT FOR OTHERS. >> THANK YOU.\nTHANKS VERY MUCH, BRIAN. >> THANKS ANDREA.\nTHANKS FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLEAR UP SOME OF\nTHIS.",

THERE IS NO QUID PRO QUO\nESTABLISHED IN THE A.P. REPORT, BUT THERE'S NO DOUBT THE OPTICS\nARE BAD. IT GIVES DONALD TRUMP YET\nANOTHER OPENING TO ATTACK HERE.

HE SAID I HAVE TO BE ME, BUT NOW\nIT IS BETWEEN ME AND HILLARY CLINTON.\nDONALD TRUMP REALLY WANTS TO SPEND A LOT OF HIS TIME FOCUSING\nON HILLARY CLINTON.

THEY'RE ALWAYS GOING TO GET\nFACE TIME WITH HER. EVEN IF SAUDI ARABIA GIVES MONEY\nTO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, WHICH THEY DID, THEY'RE STILL GOING TO\nGET FACE TIME. WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT QUESTIONS\nOF WAS THERE A SWEETHEART DEAL OR CORRUPTION.\nIT'S SIMPLY A QUESTION OF ACCESS.\nACCESS IS AN IMPORTANT THING IN WASHINGTON, OBVIOUSLY.\nTHAT'S WHAT THEY PAY LOBBYISTS FOR.\nWHAT WE DID WAS WE WENT THROUGH -- WE HAVE A COMPLETE\nSET OF SECRETARY CLINTON'S CALENDARS AND WE HAVE A SET OF\nHER PLANNING SCHEDULES THAT HAVE BEEN FORTH COMING FROM THE STATE\nDEPARTMENT. THEY'RE NOT COMPLETE YET.\nPART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHEN WE ASKED FOR THESE SCHEDULES AS\nEARLY AS 2010 FROM SECRETARY CLINTON'S STATE DEPARTMENT, WE\nDIDN'T GET THEM. WE DIDN'T GET THEM FOR YEARS\nAFTERWARDS. AND WE FINALLY HAD TO SUE TO GET\nTHEM. WE'RE KIND OF BEHIND THE EIGHT\nBALL HERE AS MANY OTHER NEWS AND POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS ARE.\nTHAT'S WHY ALL THIS INFORMATION IS TUMBLING OUT NOW.\nWE WENT BACK AND WENT THROUGH ALL OF THESE AND LOOKED AT ALL\nOF THE MEETINGS THAT SHE HAD WITH THESE FOLKS WHO HAD PRIVATE\nINTERESTS OUTSIDE THE GOVERNMENT.\nWE'RE TALKING CORPORATIONS, PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS,\nPHILANTHROPIC AGENCIES, NON-PROFITS, WHAT HAVE YOU.\nWHAT WE FOUND WAS ABOUT 85 OF THE 154 INDIVIDUALS THAT MET\nWITH HER REPRESENTING THESE VARIOUS INTERESTS, ABOUT 85 OF\nTHEM HAD GIVEN SOME SORT OF DONATION TO THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION. >> BEYOND THESE MEETINGS, YOU\nDID NOT FIND ANY DEFINITIVE QUID PRO QUO.\nTHEY HAD A MEETING AND THEY RECEIVED SOME SORT OF ACCESS OR\nSPECIAL TREATMENT FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT.\n>> NO. THEY GOT ACCESS.\nTHEY GOT IN AND GOT TO TALK TO HER.\nAND WE FOUND THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THESE 85 FOLKS HAD\nIN COMMON WAS THAT THEY HAD GIVEN TO THE FOUNDATION.\nTHAT'S THE EXTENT OF IT. IF A POLITICAL CANDIDATE WANTS\nTO TRY TO TAKE THAT AND PUSH THE ENVELOPE IN TRYING TO SAY IT\nMEANS SOMETHING ELSE, THAT'S THEIR BUSINESS.\nWHAT WE'RE SAYING HERE IS THAT AT LEAST ONE OF THE\nCOMMONALITIES IN THE AT LEAST 85 OF THESE FOLKS WAS THEY HAD\nDONATED TO THE FOUNDATION. I MEAN, DID THEY -- DID THEY\nDONATE SPECIFICALLY TO GET THAT ACCESS?\nWE DON'T KNOW. BUT IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING TO\nLOOK AT.

WHY NOT JUST MAKE THOSE CHANGES\nNOW, HAVE YOUR HUSBAND STEP AWAY FROM THE FOUNDATION NOW?\n>> FIRST, WHAT TRUMP HAS SAID IS RIDICULOUS.\nMY WORK AS SECRETARY OF STATE WAS NOT INFLUENCED BY ANY\nOUTSIDE FORCES. I MADE POLICY DECISIONS BASED ON\nWHAT I THOUGHT WAS RIGHT TO KEEP AMERICANS SAFE AND TO PROTECT\nU.S. INTERESTS ABROAD. NO WILD POLITICAL ATTACK BY\nDONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO CHANGE THAT.\nAND IN FACT, THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAS SAID ITSELF THAT\nTHERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF ANY KIND OF IMPROPRIETY AT ALL.\nNOW, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE FOUNDATION,\nWHICH DOES DO LIFE-SAVING WORK AND IS SO WELL RESPECTED HERE IN\nOUR COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD, HAS BEEN DOING THIS WORK\nFOR A NUMBER OF YEARS, AND IN 2009 THEY TOOK STEPS THAT WENT\nABOVE AND BEYOND ALL LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND INDEED ALL\nSTANDARD REQUIREMENTS FOLLOWED BY EVERY OTHER CHARITABLE\nORGANIZATION. I THINK THAT THE ANNOUNCEMENT\nTHAT THE FOUNDATION HAS MADE REALLY REFLECTS ITS DESIRE TO\nCONTINUE AS MUCH OF ITS IMPORTANT WORK AS POSSIBLE, BUT\nTO DO IT IN A WAY THAT PROVIDES GREAT DISCLOSURE.\nALTHOUGH NONE OF THIS IS LEGALLY REQUIRED, THE STEPS GO FURTHER\nTHAN THE POLICIES THAT WERE IN PLACE WHEN I WAS SECRETARY OF\nSTATE. IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER,\nANDERSON, THE FOUNDATION IS A CHARITY.\nNEITHER MY HUSBAND NOR I HAVE EVER DRAWN A SALARY FROM IT.\nYOU KNOW MORE ABOUT THE FOUNDATION THAN YOU KNOW ABOUT\nANYTHING CONCERNING DONALD TRUMP'S WEALTH, HIS BUSINESS,\nHIS TAX RETURNS. I THINK IT'S QUITE REMARKABLE,\nHIS REFUSAL TO RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS IS EVEN MORE CONCERNING\nGIVEN THE RECENT NEWS THAT HIS BUSINESSES ARE HUNDREDS OF\nMILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN DEBT TO BIG BANKS, INCLUDING THE\nSTATE-OWNED BANK OF CHINA AND BUSINESS GROUPS WITH TIES TO THE\nKREMLIN. >> WHY WAS IT OKAY FOR THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION TO ACCEPT FOREIGN DONATIONS WHEN YOU WERE\nSECRETARY OF STATE, BUT IT WOULDN'T BE OKAY IF YOU WERE\nPRESIDENT? >> WELL, WHAT WE DID WHEN I WAS\nSECRETARY OF STATE, AS I SAID, WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND ANYTHING\nTHAT WAS REQUIRED, ANYTHING THAT ANY CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION HAS\nTO DO. NOW, OBVIOUSLY IF I AM\nPRESIDENT, THERE WILL BE SOME UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES, AND THAT'S\nWHY THE FOUNDATION HAS LAID OUT ADDITIONAL, UNPRECEDENTED --\n>> BUT DIDN'T THOSE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES EXIST WHEN YOU\nWERE SECRETARY OF STATE? >> NO, NO.\nYOU KNOW, LOOK, ANDERSON, I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF SMOKE AND\nTHERE'S NO FIRE. THIS AP REPORT, PUT IT IN\nCONTEXT. THIS EXCLUDES NEARLY 2,000\nMEETINGS I HAD WITH WORLD LEADERS, PLUS COUNTLESS OTHER\nMEETINGS WITH U.S. GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WHEN I WAS SECRETARY\nOF STATE. IT LOOKED AT A SMALL PORTION OF\nMY TIME. IT DREW THE CONCLUSION AND MADE\nTHE SUGGESTION THAT MY MEETINGS WITH PEOPLE LIKE THE LATE, GREAT\nELIE WIESEL OR LINDA GATES OR THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNER WERE\nSOMEHOW DUE TO CONNECTIONS WITH THE FOUNDATION INSTEAD OF THEIR\nSTATUS AS HIGHLY RESPECTED GLOBAL LEADERS.\nTHAT IS ABSURD. >> ALL RIGHT.\nLET'S TALK ABOUT THIS. JOINING US NOW IS CONNECTICUT\nCONGRESSMAN AND A CLINTON SUPPORTER, JIM HIMES.\nTHANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. >> GOOD MORNING, POPPY.\n>> LET'S TALK FIRST ABOUT THE FOUNDATION.\nYOU HEARD WHAT SHE TOLD ANDERSON.\nI'LL PREFACE IT BY SAYING THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THE\nGOOD WORK THE FOUNDATION DOES AND CONTINUES TO DO.\nIT'S BEYOND THAT BECAUSE IT'S BECOME CLEAR THAT THERE WAS NOT\nA TOTAL SEPARATION BETWEEN HILLARY CLINTON'S TIME AS\nSECRETARY OF STATE AND THE FOUNDATION, RIGHT.\nTHIS FOLLOWS HER E-MAIL CONTROVERSY.\nSO SOME LOOK AT THIS, CONGRESSMAN, AND THEY SAY, THIS\nIS YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HILLARY CLINTON PLAY MANAGER BY\nHER OWN RULES, THE NARRATIVE ABOUT THE CLINTONS.\nAND THEY SAY, IS THIS A LENS THROUGH WHICH WE CAN SEE HOW SHE\nWOULD OPERATE AS PRESIDENT, TO HAVE HER OWN SEPARATE SET OF\nRULES THAT IS ABOVE OTHERS. NOT ABOUT LEGALITY BUT ABOUT THE\nPERCEPTION. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE FOLKS?\n>> WELL, THIS ISN'T AN EXAMPLE OF THE CLINTONS PLAYING BY THEIR\nOWN RULES BECAUSE THERE'S ABSOLUTELY ZERO EVIDENCE, ZERO\nEVIDENCE THAT ANY RULES WERE BROKEN HERE.\nNOW, WHAT IS UNDENIABLE IS THAT THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY FOR A\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST, OF COURSE. BY THE WAY, THAT'S TRUE IN\nJOURNALISM. IT'S TRUE IN POLITICS.\nIT'S TRUE ALL OVER THE PLACE. >> IT'S ABOUT PERCEPTION TOO.\nIT'S ABOUT HER AIDES, LIKE SHERYL MILS, COMING UP TO NEW\nYORK TO INTERVIEW CANDIDATES FOR HIGH POSITIONS IN THE\nFOUNDATION. IT'S ABOUT THE PERCEPTION OF\nIMPROPRIETY. >> I THINK THE QUESTION IS,\nTHOUGH, IF YOU WANT TO BELIEVE EVEN A TENTH OF THE FOAM AT THE\nMOUTH RHETORIC YOU'RE HEARING OUT OF DONALD TRUMP, THE\nQUESTION IS, DID SOMEBODY ACTUALLY GET SOMETHING FROM THE\nSTATE DEPARTMENT FROM THE SECRETARY OF STATE WHILE SHE WAS\nSECRETARY OF STATE BECAUSE THEY DONATED TO THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION? THE ANSWER TO THAT, ACCORDING TO\nTHE STATE DEPARTMENT, AND ACCORDING TO ANYBODY, IS NO.\n>> SHOULD THE LINES HAVE BEEN LESS BLURRY?\nI'M NOT TALKING ABOUT ANY LAWS BEING BROKEN.\nBUT I'M TALKING ABOUT WHAT IS CLEARLY A CLOSER RELATIONSHIP\nTHAN WAS THOUGHT BEFORE AND THEN WHAT SHE AGREED TO WITH THE\nOBAMA ADMINISTRATION WHEN SHE BECAME SECRETARY OF STATE ON HOW\nSHE WOULD DEAL WITH THE FOUNDATION.\n>> I THINK WHAT YOU CAN SAY IS THAT THERE WERE STAFF MEMBERS OF\nTHE FOUNDATION COMMUNICATING WITH STAFF MEMBERS OF STATE, AND\nALL OF THOSE STAFF MEMBERS PROBABLY COULD HAVE USED AN\nAWFUL LOT MORE DISCIPLINE AROUND THAT SEPARATION.\nBUT AGAIN -- AND LOOK, YOU'VE SEEN THE E-MAILS.\nTHERE WERE E-MAILS SENT, REQUESTS MADE.\nTHOSE REQUESTS WERE BY AND LARGE NOT ABIDED BY.\nTHE SO-CALLED EVIDENCE THAT MAYBE THERE WAS A, YOU KNOW --\nTHAT THERE WAS A CONFLICT, THAT THE CROWN PRINCE OF BAHRAIN GOT\nTO MEET WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE.\nHELLO, HE'S THE CROWN PRINCE OF BAHRAIN, A PLACE WHERE THE FIFTH\nFLEET OF THE UNITED STATES NAVY IS BASED.\nA NOBEL PRIZE AND PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM.\nTHERE'S ZERO EVIDENCE THESE PEOPLE GOT ANYTHING FOR THEIR\nCONTRIBUTION. >> I'D LIKE TO ALSO GET YOUR\nTAKE ON HER E-MAILS. I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO HOW\nHILLARY CLINTON ANSWERED ANDERSON'S QUESTION ABOUT\nE-MAILS.",

              "text": ">>> HILLARY CLINTON FIRED UP,\nDEFENDING THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nTHE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DIGGING IN, CALLING\nDONALD TRUMP'S BLISTERING PAY FOR PLAY ACCUSATIONS NOTHING\nSHORT OF ABSURD. HERE'S WHAT SHE TOLD CNN'S\nANDERSON COOPER. >> HE ALSO SAID TODAY, QUOTE,\nTHAT YOU SOLD FAVORS AND ACCESS IN EXCHANGE FOR CASH FROM PEOPLE\nWHO DONATED TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nI KNOW YOU POINT TO THE LIFE-SAVING WORK FOR THE\nFOUNDATION, THAT THE FOUNDATION HAS DONE OVER THE YEARS, GETTING\nLOW-COST HIV DRUG AND OTHER THINGS.\nI KNOW YOU DENY THE CHARGES THAT MR. TRUMP IS MAKING THERE.\nAT THE VERY LEAST, THERE IS AN APPEARANCE OF A CONFLICT OF\nINTEREST FOR THE FOUNDATION. YOU'VE AGREED TO MAKE CHANGES IF\nYOU'RE ELECTED. WHY NOT JUST MAKE THOSE CHANGES\nNOW, HAVE YOUR HUSBAND STEP AWAY FROM THE FOUNDATION NOW?\n>> FIRST, WHAT TRUMP HAS SAID IS RIDICULOUS.\nMY WORK AS SECRETARY OF STATE WAS NOT INFLUENCED BY ANY\nOUTSIDE FORCES. I MADE POLICY DECISIONS BASED ON\nWHAT I THOUGHT WAS RIGHT TO KEEP AMERICANS SAFE AND TO PROTECT\nU.S. INTERESTS ABROAD. NO WILD POLITICAL ATTACK BY\nDONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO CHANGE THAT.\nAND IN FACT, THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAS SAID ITSELF THAT\nTHERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF ANY KIND OF IMPROPRIETY AT ALL.\nNOW, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE FOUNDATION,\nWHICH DOES DO LIFE-SAVING WORK AND IS SO WELL RESPECTED HERE IN\nOUR COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD, HAS BEEN DOING THIS WORK\nFOR A NUMBER OF YEARS, AND IN 2009 THEY TOOK STEPS THAT WENT\nABOVE AND BEYOND ALL LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND INDEED ALL\nSTANDARD REQUIREMENTS FOLLOWED BY EVERY OTHER CHARITABLE\nORGANIZATION. I THINK THAT THE ANNOUNCEMENT\nTHAT THE FOUNDATION HAS MADE REALLY REFLECTS ITS DESIRE TO\nCONTINUE AS MUCH OF ITS IMPORTANT WORK AS POSSIBLE, BUT\nTO DO IT IN A WAY THAT PROVIDES GREAT DISCLOSURE.\nALTHOUGH NONE OF THIS IS LEGALLY REQUIRED, THE STEPS GO FURTHER\nTHAN THE POLICIES THAT WERE IN PLACE WHEN I WAS SECRETARY OF\nSTATE. IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER,\nANDERSON, THE FOUNDATION IS A CHARITY.\nNEITHER MY HUSBAND NOR I HAVE EVER DRAWN A SALARY FROM IT.\nYOU KNOW MORE ABOUT THE FOUNDATION THAN YOU KNOW ABOUT\nANYTHING CONCERNING DONALD TRUMP'S WEALTH, HIS BUSINESS,\nHIS TAX RETURNS. I THINK IT'S QUITE REMARKABLE,\nHIS REFUSAL TO RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS IS EVEN MORE CONCERNING\nGIVEN THE RECENT NEWS THAT HIS BUSINESSES ARE HUNDREDS OF\nMILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN DEBT TO BIG BANKS, INCLUDING THE\nSTATE-OWNED BANK OF CHINA AND BUSINESS GROUPS WITH TIES TO THE\nKREMLIN. >> WHY WAS IT OKAY FOR THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION TO ACCEPT FOREIGN DONATIONS WHEN YOU WERE\nSECRETARY OF STATE, BUT IT WOULDN'T BE OKAY IF YOU WERE\nPRESIDENT? >> WELL, WHAT WE DID WHEN I WAS\nSECRETARY OF STATE, AS I SAID, WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND ANYTHING\nTHAT WAS REQUIRED, ANYTHING THAT ANY CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION HAS\nTO DO. NOW, OBVIOUSLY IF I AM\nPRESIDENT, THERE WILL BE SOME UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES, AND THAT'S\nWHY THE FOUNDATION HAS LAID OUT ADDITIONAL, UNPRECEDENTED --\n>> BUT DIDN'T THOSE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES EXIST WHEN YOU\nWERE SECRETARY OF STATE? >> NO, NO.\nYOU KNOW, LOOK, ANDERSON, I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF SMOKE AND\nTHERE'S NO FIRE. THIS AP REPORT, PUT IT IN\nCONTEXT. THIS EXCLUDES NEARLY 2,000\nMEETINGS I HAD WITH WORLD LEADERS, PLUS COUNTLESS OTHER\nMEETINGS WITH U.S. GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WHEN I WAS SECRETARY\nOF STATE. IT LOOKED AT A SMALL PORTION OF\nMY TIME. IT DREW THE CONCLUSION AND MADE\nTHE SUGGESTION THAT MY MEETINGS WITH PEOPLE LIKE THE LATE, GREAT\nELIE WEISEL OR LINDA GATES OR THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNER WERE\nSOMEHOW DUE TO CONNECTIONS WITH THE FOUNDATION INSTEAD OF THEIR\nSTATUS AS HIGHLY RESPECTED GLOBAL LEADERS.\nTHAT IS ABSURD. >> ALL RIGHT.\nLET'S BRING BACK IN OUR PANEL TO TALK ABOUT IT.\nMAGGIE HABERMAN AND PHILIP BUMP BACK WITH US, REACTING TO THE\nNEWS, THAT INTERVIEW. NO ONE IS QUESTIONING THE GOOD\nWORK OF THE FOUNDATION, THEY'RE JUST NOT.\nBUT WHEN SHE SAYS, OKAY, THE RULES WILL NEED TO CHANGE IF I'M\nPRESIDENT, BUT THEY DIDN'T NEED TO CHANGE WHEN I WAS SECRETARY\nOF STATE. THEN WHEN ANDERSON PRESSED HER\nON THAT, SHE SAID BASICALLY, WELL, I WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND IN\n2009. YOU KNOW WHY SHE WENT ABOVE AND\nBEYOND? BECAUSE NEVER BEFORE HAD THERE\nBEEN A SITUATION LIKE THAT. AND THAT'S NOT A DIRECT ANSWER\nTO THE QUESTION. I WONDER IF YOU THINK THAT'S\nENOUGH FOR THE VOTER. >> I DON'T THINK IT'S ENOUGH FOR\nTHE VOTER, AND I DON'T THINK IT'S ENOUGH FOR WHAT'S GOING TO\nHAPPEN OVER THE NEXT EIGHT WEEKS IN TERMS OF THE DEBATE AND ANY\nFUTURE INTERVIEWS. THE FACT SHE DID THIS INTERVIEW\nAT ALL IS THE FACT THAT WHAT TRUMP IS DOING, HOWEVER\nUNREALISTIC, IS GETTING THROUGH TO PEOPLE.\nI THINK ANDERSON ASKED THE EXACT RIGHT QUESTION, WHICH IS IF THIS\nIS NOT GOING TO BE OKAY WHEN YOU'RE PRESIDENT, WHY WAS IT\nOKAY BEFORE. SHE DOESN'T HAVE A GREAT ANSWER.\n>> WHY NOT STOP NOW? >> OR WHY NOT STOP NOW.\nTHERE ARE NO GREAT ANSWERS TO THIS.\nIT IS TRUE THE FOUNDATION DOES GOOD WORK, BUT IT ALSO --\nTHERE'S AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF DEFENSIVENESS ON THE PART OF THE\nCLUN TONS ABOUT THIS AND HAS BEEN FOR MANY, MANY YEARS ABOUT\nWHAT ARE LEGITIMATE QUESTIONS. AT THE END OF THE DAY, YES, IT\nIS TRUE. IT IS SMOKE, THERE IS NO\nEVIDENCE OF A QUID PRO QUO. BUT THERE IS CERTAINLY CLEAR\nEVIDENCE OF THE FOUNDATION AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT DOING WHAT\nTHEY SAID THEY WOULDN'T DO, WHICH IS HAVE A LOT OF\nINTERACTION AND A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH.\nTHAT IS GOING TO LOOK STRANGE. TO YOUR POINT, WE'VE NEVER HAD A\nSET OF CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE THIS BEFORE.\nUSUALLY WHAT PEOPLE WOULD DO IN THAT SITUATION IS TRY TO USE THE\nUTMOST CAUTION. THE CLINTONS REPEATEDLY, OVER\nMANY YEARS, GET INTO THESE KIND OF SITUATIONS WHERE THERE'S JUST\nENOUGH FOR CRITICS TO HIT THEM ON.\nTHE TWO AIDES WHO ARE THE MOST INVOLVED IN THIS, SHERYL MILLS\nAND HUMA ABEDIN, I ASSUME HILLARY CLINTON WILL WANT TO\nBRING INTO THE WHITE HOUSE BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN WITH HER\nFOR A LONG TIME. THAT'S ALSO WHERE THERE'S GOING\nTO BE A HEADACHE GOING FORWARD. >> LOOK, THERE'S A STANDARD\nHERE. IT'S AN ODD TURN OF EVENTS THAT\nIN THIS ELECTION WE'RE MAKING ILLEGALITY THE BAR FOR CONDUCT.\nSEMBLANCE OF IMPROPRIETY. IT SOUNDS LIKE LEGAL SPEAK, BUT\nLOOK IT UP. IT EXISTS FOR A REASON.\nOUTWARD APPEARANCE. WHAT SHE'LL BENEFIT FROM IS\nTRUMP AND HIS SURROGATES GOING WAY TOO FAR ON THIS.\nTHEY'RE SAYING THE FOUNDATION WAS A CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE, THAT\nIT WAS PAY FOR PLAY. IS THERE ANY PROOF OF PAY FOR\nPLAY? >> NO, NOT AT ALL.\nAGAIN, WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE IS WE ARE SEEING PEOPLE WHO HAVE\nRELATIONSHIPS WITH THE CLINTONS, HAVING A RELATIONSHIP WITH\nCLINTON AS SECRETARY OF STATE, AND HAVING A RELATIONSHIP WITH\nTHE CLINTONS AS THE HEADS OF THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nWE'RE NOT SEEING ANY SITUATION -- EVEN THE AP REPORT\nDOESN'T SAY WHEN THE PEOPLE GAVE MONEY IN RELATIONSHIP TO WHEN\nTHEY HAD THESE MEETINGS. THERE'S SO MANY MISSING PARTS TO\nTHIS STORY, WHICH OF COURSE THE CLINTONS HOPE NEVER COME UP.\n>> AND THE IRONY IS THE CHANGE AGENT IS DONALD TRUMP, WHO GAVE\nMONEY TO THE FOUNDATION, WHO OPENLY SAYS THIS GAME EXISTS, I\nKNOW, BECAUSE I PLAY IT. >> HE HAS NOT BEEN ASKED,\nHOWEVER, WHY HE GAVE THAT MONEY, IF HE THINKS THAT IT WAS A\nCRIMINAL ENTERPRISE. >> HE HAS SAID IN THE PAST THE\nREASON HE GAVE MONEY TO POLITICIANS WAS TO GET\nSOMETHING. >> YES, HE'S GIVEN THAT AS A\nBROAD ANSWER. I THINK HE'S ALSO GOING TO GET\nPRESSED ON THAT IN THE DEBATE. >> SO LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT HE\nSAID ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON LAST NIGHT.\nHE SAID, VERY LOUDLY, SHE IS A BIGOT.\nTHIS IS ALL PART OF HIS PLAY TO GET EVEN A FEW POINTS STRONGER\nON THE MINORITY VOTERS, ESPECIALLY AFRICAN-AMERICANS.\nBUT HIM DOING IT IN THAT WAY, TAKING IT MUCH FURTHER THAN HE\nTOOK IT LAST WEEK WHEN HE SAID, WHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO\nLOSE BY CHOOSING ME. NOW HE'S GOING BEYOND THAT\nSAYING DON'T CHOOSE HER BECAUSE SHE'S A BIGOT.\nI THINK WE HAVE THE SOUND. WE CAN PLAY IT.\n>> HILLARY CLINTON IS A BIGOT. WHO SEES PEOPLE OF COLOR --\n[ APPLAUSE ] -- ONLY AS VOTES, NOT AS HUMAN\nBEINGS WORTHY OF A BETTER FUTURE.\nSHE'S GOING TO DO NOTHING FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS.\nSHE'S GOING TO DO NOTHING FOR THE HISPANICS.\nSHE DOESN'T CARE WHAT HER POLICIES HAVE DONE TO YOUR\nCOMMUNITIES. >> PHIL, THERE ARE TWO SCHOOLS\nOF THOUGHT HERE. IS HE TRYING TO GET A FEW\nMORE%AGE POINTS ON AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS TO GET\nUP FROM 1% IN THE POLLS? OR IS HE TRYING TO CONVINCE\nEDUCATED WHITE VOTERS THAT HE'S NOT RACIST?\n>> I WOULD DEFINITELY LEAN TOWARD THE LATTER OPTION THERE.\nI THINK THAT LINE OF ARGUMENT IS NOT GOING TO BE AN EFFECTIVE\nLINE OF ARGUMENT TO A COMMUNITY THAT SEES THE CLINTONS AS HAVING\nBEEN PART OF -- YOU KNOW, HAVING A RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM FOR A\nLONG TIME. IT'S PART OF THE REASON HILLARY\nCLINTON HAD SUCH STRONG SUPPORT FROM THE BLACK COMMUNITY IN THE\nDEMOCRATIC PRIMARY. THAT'S THE REASON SHE WON BY THE\nMARGIN SHE DID BECAUSE SHE HAD SO MUCH SUPPORT FROM THE BLACK\nCOMMUNITY. I DON'T THINK DONALD TRUMP\nMAKING AN ARGUMENT, WHICH ESSENTIALLY IS AN ARGUMENT TO\nREPUBLICANS WHO ARE SKEPTICAL OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE\nBLACK COMMUNITY AND DEMOCRATS. THAT'S WHY HE'S MAKING THE\nARGUMENT IN THE WAY THAT HE MADE IT.\nTHAT'S NOT AN ARGUMENT THAT'S BEING MADE TO THE BLACK\nCOMMUNITY. IT'S BEING MADE TO THOSE\nREPUBLICANS. >> YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE THE\nONUS OFF THE CANDIDATE. HE'S ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR\nWHAT COMES OUT OF HIS MOUTH. BUT SOMEBODY DIDN'T DO HIM A\nFAVOR. THAT WAS SUPPOSEDLY IN THE\nPROMPTER. THAT MEANS MESSAGING FOR HIM IS\nCALLING HILLARY CLINTON A BIGOT. NOT ONLY IS HE NOT GOING TO\nFAVOR IN COMPARISON TO HER IN TERM OF WHAT HE'S DONE FOR THAT\nCOMMUNITY, BECAUSE HE HASN'T REALLY DONE ANYTHING.\nBUT HOW IS THAT GOING TO HELP REMOVE STINK FROM TRUMP THAT\nEVERY TIME HE OPENS HIS MOUTH, HIS FOOT GOES RIGHT INTO IT.\n>> EVERY TIME HE TRIES TO MAKE THIS A REFERENDUM ON SOMETHING\nOTHER THAN HIMSELF, IT COMES BACK TO BEING A REFERENDUM ON\nDONALD TRUMP. THERE IS A GENERATIONAL DIVIDE\nAND HAS BEEN THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN IN TERMS OF HILLARY\nCLINTON'S SUPPORT AMONG BLACK VOTERS.\nYOUNGER BLACK VOTERS WHO CAME OF AGE DURING THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE\nAND DURING THE BLACK LIVES MATTER MOVEMENT TEND TO VIEW HER\nWITH MORE SKEPTICISM, OR SOME DO.\nBUT HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN PRETTY VOCAL ABOUT RACE SINCE\nTHE CHARLESTON SHOOTING, WHICH IS GOING BACK TO JUNE OF 2015.\nSHE'S BEEN REALLY CLEAR ON IT. I SPOKE TO SOME PEOPLE YESTERDAY\nWHO WERE SAYING, YES, I DON'T LIKE HILLARY CLINTON, BUT THAT\nDOESN'T MEAN THAT I'M NOT AWARE OF WHAT DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN\nSAYING FOR THE LAST 15 MONTHS. THIS IS SORT OF PROBLEMATIC.\nTHE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY IS YOU TALK TO REPUBLICANS\nPRIVATELY, MANY OF THEM WILL SAY THIS ISN'T A WINNING MESSAGE\nPERIOD. HE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT THE\nECONOMY. HE'S NOT GOING TO GET ENOUGH\nBLACK VOTERS TO MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCE.\nFRANKLY AT THIS POINT WITH THIS MESSAGE, HE'S NOT GOING TO GET\nENOUGH CONCERNED WHITE VOTERS, SUBURBANITES WHO DON'T LIKE HIM\nBEING CALLED A RACIST. HE NEEDS TO REFOCUS WHAT VOTERS\nARE GOING TO THE BALLOT BOX ON. HE'S MAKING THIS ABOUT RACE EVEN\nAS HE KEEPS TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM IT.\n>> AND IT COULD BE ABOUT THE ECONOMY.\nGUYS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. COMING UP NEXT, WE'RE GOING TO\nTAKE YOU TO ITALY, AMID THE DEATH AND DESTRUCTION THERE\nFOLLOWING THAT HORRIFIC EARTHQUAKE.\nWE'LL TELL YOU A REMARKABLE STORY OF SURVIVAL.\nTHE DETAIL OF THAT NEXT.",

I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF SMOKE\nAND THERE'S NO FIRE. THE AP REPORT PUT IT IN CONTEXT.\nIT EXCLUDES NEARLY 2,000 MEETINGS I HAD WITH WORLD\nLEADERS AND COUNTLESS OTHERS WITH U.S. OFFICIALS WHEN I WAS\nSECRETARY OF STATE. IT LOOKED AT A SMALL PORTION OF\nMY TIME AND DROVE THE INCLUSION AND MADE THE SUGGESTION THAT MY\nMEETINGS WITH PEOPLE LIKE MELINDA GATES WERE DUE TO\nCONNECTIONS WITH THE FOUNDATION INSTEAD OF THEIR STATUS AS\nHIGHLY RESPECTED GLOBAL LEADERS. THAT IS ABSURD.\n>> JOSH, SHE IS TALKING ABOUT THE AP REPORT OF THE PRIVATE\nMEETINGS, MORE THAN HALF, WERE PEOPLE WHO DONATED TO THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION. DOES THIS RESPONSE TO ANDERSON\nADDRESS THE QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS?\n>> I THINK IT DOES. IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM.\nON THE FACTS, CLINTON IS RIGHT. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A SMALL\nFRACTION OF THE MEETINGS SHE HAD.\nTHE NUMBERS OF THE AP STORY TOOK THAT OUT OF CONTEXT.\nIT WAS TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT BY PEOPLE ON THE RIGHT WHO ARE\nANALYZING THAT AP STORY. SHE IS BASICALLY RIGHT ON THE\nFACTS, BUT SHE IS WRONG ON THE POLITICS.\nTHE CLINTON FOUNDATION SCANDAL HAS BALLOONED.\nNOBODY CAN BE SURE WHERE THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST MAY OR MAY\nNOT HAVE ULTIMATELY RESIDED. I MEAN, YES, IT IS TRUE A LOT OF\nTHE PEOPLE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE GOTTEN MEETINGS ANY WAY.\nTHERE IS NO REAL WAY TO KNOW. THROUGH LACK OF TRANSPARENCY AND\nDISCLOSURE WHICH IS NOW BEING MADE CLEAR BY THE RELEASE OF\nE-MAILS, SHE IS LOSING THE POLITICAL BATTLE.\n>> JOSH, TO BE CLEAR. THAT WAS THE CONCERN AT THE\nBEGINNING IN 2009 WHEN SHE WAS CONFIRMED.\nFORGET PAY TO PLAY FOR LEGALITIES HERE.\nTHE WORD WAS APPEARANCE OF CONFLICT.\nTO AVOID THE APPEARANCE OF CONFLICT.\nTHAT IS NOT A LEGAL WORD HERE. THIS IS A POLITICAL WORD.\nTHEY DIDN'T WANT THIS TO BE POLITICALLY SKETCHY.\n>> YOU SHOULD NOT JUST DO THE BEAR MINIMUM.\nGO ABOVE AND BEYOND. THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE DO WHO ARE\nTRUSTED WITH PUBLIC SERVICE. THE CLINTON FOUNDATION MADE AN\nERROR BY TAKING THAT HALF STEP. WE WILL CUT OFF THE FOREIGN\nDONATIONS AFTER THE ELECTION. THAT RAISES THE IMMEDIATE\nQUESTION. IF IT IS WRONG AFTER THE\nELECTION, WHY NOT NOW? THEY ALSO GAVE THEM JUST ENOUGH\nTO GO WITH ON THE IDEA OF PERCEPTION OF INN PROPER\nPRIORITY. IT IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE.\nIF IT IS A LITTLE BIT SHADY, THEN IT IS A LOT SHADY.\nNOW THEY ADMITTED IT IS A LITTLE BIT SHADY, IT IS TOUGH.\n>> SO HILLARY CLINTON ALSO LAST NIGHT ON ANDERSON TALKING ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP. DONALD TRUMP SHIFTING POSITION\nON IMMIGRATION. I AM REALLY EAGER TO HEAR WHAT\nDONALD TRUMP SAYS IN THE IMMIGRATION SPEECH NEXT WEEK\nABOUT WHAT EXACTLY IS HIS THOUGHT ON DEPORTING 11 MILLION\nPEOPLE. HE BASICALLY GOT THE NOMINATION\nON THE BACK OF THE PILLAR OF HIS POLICY.\nTHIS IS WHAT HILLARY CLINTON SAID ABOUT IT.\n>> HE IS TRYING TO DO KIND OF A SHUFFLE HERE.\nI THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE ENTIRE CONTEXT.\nWE NEED TO BELIEVE HIM WHEN HE BULLIES AND THREATENS TO THROW\nOUT EVERY IMMIGRANT IN THE COUNTRY.\nCERTAINLY WHEN HE CHANGES HIS POSITION THREE TIMES IN ONE DAY,\nIT SENDS A MESSAGE THAT IT IS JUST A DESPERATE EFFORT TO TRY\nTO LAND SOMEWHERE THAT ISN'T AS DEVASTATING TO HIS CAMPAIGN AS\nHIS COMMENTS AND HIS POSITIONS HAVE BEEN UP UNTIL NOW.\n>> WITH THE E-MAILS AND BACK DROP AND CLINTON FOUNDATION IN\nTHE BACK DROP AND LACK OF PRESS CONFERENCE AND CRITICISM IN THE\nMEDIA AND LACK OF TRANSPARENCY. DOES DONALD TRUMP'S SHIFT ON\nIMMIGRATION, DOES IT LOSE P POTENTCY?\n>> THIS IS UNWORKABLE ON ITS FACE.\nEVERYONE WAS EXPECTING THAT WHEN DONALD TRUMP WOULD GET TO THE\nGENERAL ELECTION. HE WOULD SWITCH TO SOMETHING\nMORE PLAUSIBLE. HE HAS NOW DONE IT.\nHE REMOVED THAT FROM THE LIST OF HIS PROBLEMS.\nTHAT ALL TO HIS BENEFIT. THIS IS SHALL WE SAY PIVOT?\n>> SOFTEN. PIVOT.\nSHIFT. >> IT IS A FLIP FLOP PURE AND\nSIMPLE. YOU CAN SAY IT IS A FLIP.\nSOME THINK IT IS A GOOD FLIP WITH POLICY.\nIT IS A REVERSAL ON SOMETHING HE RAN ON AND WAS CENTRAL TO HIS\nCAMPAIGN. ACTUALLY, JOSH, WHAT INFURIATES\nME IS NO ONE ASKED HIM OUTRIGHT. DONALD TRUMP, YES OR NO.\nSHOULD SOME OF THE 11 MILLION PEOPLE BE ABLE TO STAY HERE\nLEGALLY? >> YES.\nTHAT IS THE AMBIGUITY. HE WANTS PEOPLE WHO TOLD HIM IN\nTHE BEGINNING, DON'T WORRY. I REALLY MEANT IT.\nHE WANTS TO TRY TO GET PEOPLE NOW, DON'T WORRY ABOUT WHAT I\nSAID BEFORE. THIS IS GOING TO BE OKAY.\nTHAT SCHEME WHERE HE DOESN'T ACTUALLY GIVE US A REAL POLICY.\nTHAT IS DESIGNED TO GIVE COVER TO ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO SUPPORT\nHIM.

WE WILL TAKE YOU THERE WHEN IT\nGETS GOING AND TRUMP IS EXPECTED TO KEEP THE HEAT OVER HILLARY\nCLINTON OVER A PRESS REPORT ABOUT ACCESS TO CLINTON WHEN SHE\nWAS SECRETARY OF STATE FROM DONORS TO THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION. THE DONORS HAD AN EASIER TIME\nGETTING THE SECRETARY'S ATTENTION AND TIME.\n>> IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE CLINTON FOUNDATION\nENDS AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT BEGINS.\nIT IS NOW ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT THE CLINTONS SET UP A BUSINESS\nTO PROFIT FROM PUBLIC OFFICE. THEY SOLD ACCESS AND SPECIFIC\nACTIONS BY AND REALLY FOR, I GUESS, THE MAKING OF LARGE\nAMOUNTS OF MONEY. >> THIS IS A WOMAN WHO MET WITH\nOVER 17,000 WORLD LEADERS, COUNTLESS OTHER GOVERNMENT\nOFFICIALS. PUBLIC FOFFICIALS IN THE UNITED\nSTATES. THEY LOOKED AT 185 MEETINGS AND\nTRIED TO DRAW A CONCLUSION TO THAT.\nI THINK IS ONE OF THE MOST MASSIVE REPRESENTATIONS YOU CAN\nSEE FROM THE DATA. THEY ARE TRYING TO MA LINE AND\nIMPLICATE THERE IS SOMETHING NEFARIOUS GOING ON WHEN THERE\nWASN'T. >> NONE OF THIS IS ILLEGAL.\nIT IS JUST THAT IMPLICATION AND THE FACT THAT IT IS BEING PAID\nAND THAT IT IS UNSTATED. LOOK, IF YOU DON'T PAY FOR THAT\nACCESS, YOU DON'T GET THE ACCESS.\n>> HERE WITH ME NOW, JUANA SUMMERS.\nAS OF TODAY A NEW FELLOW AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY INSTITUTE\nOF POLITICS AND PUBLIC SERVICE. MOLLY BALL, POLITICAL WRITER FOR\nTHE ATLANTIC. AND RYAN LIZZA A WASHINGTON\nCORRESPONDENT FOR THE NEW YORKER.\nSO LET'S TRY TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS WHEN IT COMES TO\nTHE FOUNDATION. YOU LISTEN TO DONALD TRUMP AND\nHE SAYS THE CLINTON FOUNDATION IS THE MOST CORRUPT CHARITY OF\nALL TIME, BASICALLY. THEN HAVE YOU HILLARY CLINTON\nSUPPORTERS, RYAN, SAYING THIS IS A CHARITY THAT HELPS COMBAT HIV\nAIDS AND THAT WITHOUT IT PEOPLE WOULD DIE.\nWHERE IS THE TRUTH IN HERE? >> YEAH, LOOK.\nAND THAT HAS GOTTEN LOST IN THIS.\nNO DOUBT. AND YOU JUST LOOK AT THE\nINDEPENDENT CHARITY WATCH DOGS AND WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION. AND IT IS GENERALLY PRIZED FOR\nITS WORK. IT HAS DONE GREAT WORK ALL OFF\nTHE WORLD. AND IT IS SURPRISING THAT THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION AND CLINTON CAMPAIGN HASN'T DONE MUCH OF A\nJOB EXPLAINING THAT. ON THE OTHER HAND, WHEN HILLARY\nCLINTON WAS FIRST BEING LOOKED AT FOR SECRETARY OF THE STATE,\nEVERYONE THAT LOOKED THAT NEW RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE OBAMA\nADMINISTRATION AND THE CLINTON FOUNDATION SAID WAIT A SECOND.\nTHERE IS A POTENTIAL FOR THE AT LEAST THE APPEARANCE OF A\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST. AND BACK THEN IN 2009 THE\nDECISION WAS OKAY MAKE DONATIONS CAN H WERE PREVIOUSLY PRIVATE,\nMAKE THEM PUBLIC. AND THE FOUNDATION AND OBAMA\nADMINISTRATION HAD AN UNDERSTANDING THAT LAID THAT\nOUT. OTHER PEOPLE AT THE TIME WERE\nSAYING, THAT'S NOT ENOUGH. SHE SHOULD DISASSOCIATE HERSELF\nCOMPLETELY. BILL CLINTON SHOULD NOT BE PART\nOF IT. IF YOU ARE A FOREIGN ENTITY,\nGOVERNMENT OR CITIZEN THAT WANT IT INFLEW ENTHE CLINTON STATE\nDEPARTMENT, OF COURSE YOU WILL GIVE MONEY TO THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION. SO IT'S THESE TWO THINGS.\nA FOUNDATION THAT DID GREAT THINGS BUT ALSO USED BY PEOPLE\nTO BUY ACCESS TO HER. I THINK WHAT IS NOT PROVEN YET\nIS WHAT TRUMP SAID OF THAT. THAT NOT ONLY DID THEY GET\nACCESS, WHICH ALL POLITICIANS GRANT TO THEIR DONORS, BUT\nFAVORS. >> AND WHAT IT DOES IS\nHIGHLIGHTS SOMETHING PART OF IT IS WHAT HAPPENS ON A DAILY\nBASIS, MOLLY. LIKE RYAN SAID, DONORS GET\nACCESS TO CANDIDATES. IT IS NOT ILLEGAL.\nIT MIGHT BE A LITTLE STINKY. BUT IT IS ON SUCH A GRAND SCALE\nWHEN YOU TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THE SIZE OF THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION AND OF THE CLINTONS, RIGHT?\nJUST CREATING THIS KIND OF LIKE, THIS DOESN'T SMELL QUITE RIGHT.\n>> YEAH. IT'S GROSS.\nNO SECRET THAT BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON BOTH RUN IN THESE\nCIRCLES OF SORT OF THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL AND DIPLOMATIC ELITE.\nEVEN IF SHE WEREN'T SECRETARY OF STATE, THAT THE CASE.\nWITH HER BEING FORMER PRESIDENT AND HER FORMER SENATOR.\nBUT IT IS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST ON ITS FACE WHEN HER INTEREST\nAUGHT TO BE ADVANCING OUR FOREIGN POLICY IN THE WORLD AND\nDONORS OFF THE INTERESTS ARE WHATEVER THEIR INTERESTS ARE AND\nTHEY CAN ADVANCE THEIR INTEREST IN THEIR PERCEPTION BY GOING TO,\nAS RYAN SAID, THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, WHICH HAS ITS OWN\nINTEREST. WHETHER THOSE INTERESTS ARE A\nVERY PURE AGENDA OF REDUCING POVERTY OR WHETHER THERE IS\nSOMETHING ELSE GOING ON AS DONALD TRUMP ALLEGES.\nI DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY EFD THE CLINTONS WERE PERSONALLY\nPROFITING IN THE WAY HE ALLEGES OFF OF THE CHARITY THAT THEY\nWERE RUNNING. BUT IT IS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST\nON ITS FACE. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION KNEW\nTHAT WHEN HILLARY TOOK THE JOB APP AND I DON'T THINK ENOUGH WAS\nDONE TO SEPARATE THOSE TWO, OR IF IT WAS EVEN POSSIBLE.\n>> HOW MUCH IS IT A LOSING ISSUE AT THIS POINT FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON? SOMETIMES, LIKE RYAN SAID, IT\nDOESN'T SEEM THAT THERE IS AS MUCH OF A SPONSOR MAYBE IT\nHASN'T BEEN ROBUST ENOUGH INITIALLY TO FOR HER SUPPORTERS\nTO SAY LOOK THIS CHARITY DOES GOOD WORK.\nTHAT IS OBVIOUSLY THE MESSAGE THEY WANT OUT THERE.\nTO WHAT -- HOW MUCH HAS THIS BEEN DAMAGING, DO YOU THINK,\nEVEN TO THE FOUNDATION IN THIS LEGALCY?\n>> SURE. ONE THING IS, IF I WERE TO GO\nOUTSIDE ON THE STREET AND ASK THE AVERAGE VOTER, WHAT IS THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION AND WHAT DOES IT DO, I WOULD GUESS THE AVERAGE\nPERSON DOESN'T KNOW. WE REPORT ON THESE ISSUES FROM A\nDAY-TO-DAY BASIS. SO FOR A CANDIDATE THAT IS\nHISTORICALLY LOW AFTER FAVORABLES WZ AS DOES TRUMP, AND\nWHETHER PEOPLE SEE HER AS HONEST AND TRUST WORTHINESS, IS THE\nUNKNOWN. THAT COULD MAKE IT PARTICULARLY\nDAMAGING FOR DONALD TRUMP AND WHETHER THERE WAS ANY\nIMPROPRIETY. WHETHER SHE HAS DONE ANYTHING\nACTUALLY WRONG IS LESS AFTER QUESTION THAN WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE\nBY THE AVERAGE VOTER WHO DOESN'T KNOW THE IFS AND OUTS OF THIS.\n>> WHAT ABOUT SPEECHES? SOME PAID SPEECHES.\nIF DONALD TRUMP IS TRYING TO MAKE THE CASE THERE IS THIS\nTREMENDOUS PERSONAL GAPE AND YOU DON'T SEE THAT IN THE FOUB DAGS,\nIS HE LOOKING IN THE WRONG PLACE?\nWHAT DO YOU THINK, MOLLY? >> I THINK THE SPEECHES ARE A\nBIG ISSUE. I'M SURPRISED IT HAS TAKEN THIS\nM LONG FOR THE CLINTON FOUNDATION\nTO BE AN ISSUE. I THINK PART OF THAT IS THAT THE\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN HASN'T BEEN PARTICULARLY FOCUSED ON\nPROSECUTING A CASE AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON IN AN ORGANIZED\nAND SYSTEMATIC WAY. THE FACT THAT THIS HAS BECOME\nSUCH AN ISSUE MAY BE EVIDENCE THAT HIS NEW CAMPAIGN TEAM IS\nDOING A BET HE JOB AT DRIVING MESSAGES ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S\nUNTRUST WORTHINESS AND ABOUT THE VARIOUS INVOLVEMENTS THAT SHE\nAND HER HUSBAND HAVE HAD IN VARIOUS FINANCIAL THINGS.\n>> AND POLITICALLY THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN FIGURES ANYTHING THAT\nIS A SENSITIVE SUBJECT WILL JUST GO AWAY IN A COUPLE OF NEWS\nCYCLES BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP WON'T BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT\nSOMETHING. HE WILL SAY SOMETHING OUTRAGEOUS\nAND EVERYONE WILL MOVE ON. IF IT STICKS SHE WILL HAVE TO\nGIVE A SPEECH, DEFEND IT, DEFEND THE FOUNDATION'S WORK AND WHAT\nIT DID. >> THAT'S GAMBLE.\nDONALD TRUMP WILL STEAL THE SHOW BUT MAYBE NOT IN THIS CASE,\nRIGHT? >> ABSOLUTELY.\nWE STILL HAVE ABOUT 70-SOME-ODD DAYS UNTIL ELECTION DAY.\nANYTHING COULD HAPPEN. I THINK TO THE POINT THAT RYAN\nMADE EARLIER, IT WOULD MAKE A RESPONSE, AND LET PEOPLE KNOW OF\nTHE GOOD THINGS AND NOT JUST THIS CONTENDING.\n>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.",

THE AP AS IT'S KNOWN REPORTED\nTHAT MORE THAN HALF OF THE PRIVATE CITIZENS WHO MET WITH\nHILLARY CLINTON OR TALKED WITH HER ON THE PHONE DURING PART OF\nHER TENURE AS SECRETARY OF STATE WERE DONORS TO THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION. SO LET THAT SINK IN FOR A\nMINUTE. THEY WERE DONORS.\nTHEY GOT TO MEET WITH HER. THEY GOT TO HAVE ACCESS WITH\nHER. BUT THEY WEREN'T IN GOVERNOR OF\nANY KIND. MEETING WITH SECRETARY OF STATE.\nYOU THINK ABOUT THAT, THAT IS AT LEAST 85 OF THE 154 PEOPLE\nOUTSIDE OF THE GOVERNMENT. AND COMBINED THE AP SAYS THEY\nCONTRIBUTED AS MUCH AS $156 MILLION TO THAT CHARITY.\nNOW THAT'S PROMPTED DONALD TRUMP AND A HOST OF OTHER REPUBLICANS\nTO SEIZE ON THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO ON THE ATTACK.\nTRUMP IS CALLING THE CLINTON FOUNDATION QUOTE THE MOST\nCORRUPT ENTERPRISE IN POLITICAL HISTORY.\nGOING ON TO SAY QUOTE THE FOUNDATION MUST BE SHUT DOWN\nIMMEDIATELY.

IN FACT HERE IS HOW JOEL BENSON\nEXPLAINED IT ON NEW DAY THIS MORNING.\n>> TOOK A SMALL SLIVER OF HER TENURE AS SECRETARY OF STATE,\nLESS THAN HALF OF THE TIME, LESS THAN A FRACTION OF THE MEETINGS,\nI THINK 3% THE NUMBER THEY'VE LOOKED AT OF ALL THE MEETINGS\nSHE MET WITH P.M. THIS WOMAN MET WITH OVER 17,000 WORLD LEADERS.\nCOUNTLESS OTHER GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.\nPUBLIC OFFICIALS IN THE OUT. AND THEY'VE LOOKED AT 185\nMEETING HE AND TRIED TO DRAW A CONCLUSION FROM THAT.\nI THINK IT IS ONE OF THE MOST MASSIV\nMAS MASSIVE REP REHE IS NOT TAGSS\nWHEN THERE WASN'T. >> SO FAR THEY ONLY HAVE\nSCHEDULES FROM THE FIRST HALF OF CLINTON'S TENURE.\nCLINTON COULD HAVE VOL YOU WILL TARLY RELEASED SCHEDULES BUT SHE\nHASN'T. BRIAN FALLON SAID IF THERE IS\nMORE THAN 1700 MEET WILLINGS SHE TOOK WITH WORLD LEADERS THAT\nSTATEMENT GOES ON TO NOTE THAT MEETINGS WITH SOME OF THE\nINDIVIDUALS MENTIONED IN THAT STORY LIKE PHILANTHROPIST\nMELINDA GATE AND ECONOMIST MEU HAMMED EUNICE IS SQUARELY IN THE\nTOP DIPLOMATIC.

WHO'S A GLOBAL PHILANTHROPIST\nAND HAS INVESTED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN HELPING WOMEN AND\nGIRLS IN AFRICA. JOHN KERRY HAS MET WITH MELINDA\nGATES. I'M SURE MANY REPUBLICANS HAVE\nMET WITH MELINDA GATES. I THINK THE AP STORY IS TRULY\nUNFORTUNATE BECAUSE IT'S JUST MISCHARACTERIZES THE WORK\nHILLARY IS DOING AS SECRETARY OF STATE AND THE KIND OF WORK THE\nFOUNDATION WAS DOING AND THE PEOPLE SHE'S MEETING.\nMUHAMMAD YUNIS, A PERSON WHO HAS WON A NOBEL PEACE PRIZE FOR THE\nWORK HE'S DOING, THE AP IS COUNTING.\nI THINK THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

SORRY, YOU'RE BRINGING UP\nMELINDA GATES, MUHAMMAD YUNIS. BUT THEY'RE --\n>> ABSOLUTELY, AND THAT'S WHY SHE MET WITH THEM --\n>> HOLD ON, THEY ARE ALL DONORS TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nTHE AP'S NOT MISREPRESENTING THAT, ARE THEY?\n>> NO, BUT OBVIOUSLY THE REASON SHE MET THEM WAS PROBABLY\nBECAUSE OF THE WORK THEY'D DONE. MUHAMMAD YUNIS?\nHE'S MET WITH NUMEROUS SECRETARIES OF STATE.\nIN THE UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE WORLD.\nWHY CHARACTERIZE HIM AS CLINTON DONORS?\nWHAT THEY ARE IS PEOPLE THE SECRETARY OF STATE SHOULD MEET\nWITH. THE CHALLENGE AROUND THIS WHOLE\nDEBATE AROUND THE CLINTON FOUNDATION IS A LOT OF\nMISCHARACTERIZATION. THE POLLS -- DONALD TRUMP IS\nOBVIOUSLY FAR BEHIND IN THE POLLS AND THAT'S WHY HE'S\nATTACKING ON THIS RANGE OF ISSUES.\nHE'S ESSENTIALLY AT THE END OF THE DAY ESSENTIALLY ATTACKING A\nFOUNDATION THAT PROVIDED 11 MILLION PEOPLE IN AFRICA\nLIFE-SAVING MEDICATION, AIDS MEDICATION.\nIT'S DONE A RANGE OF GREAT WORK IN THE WORLD.\nTHAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE YOU'RE SEEING\nPARTISAN ATTACKS. >> IT IS NOT JUST DONALD TRUMP\nDOING IT.

A STRAIGHT DOWN THE ROAD NEWS\nORGANIZATIONS THAT IS SHINING A LIGHT ON CLEARLY PAY FOR PLAY\nACTIVITY THAT'S GOING BETWEEN THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION -- >> ABSOLUTELY NOT --\n>> WHEN WE HAD HALF OF THE PEOPLE SHE MET OUTSIDE OF GOT\nDONATED UP TO $156 MILLION -- >> IT'S NOT HALF THE PEOPLE.\n>> I JUST MOVED HERE FROM ARKANSAS.\nTHE HOMETOWN PAPER EVEN SAID THE CLINTONS HAVE BEEN GETTING AWAY\nWITH THESE ETHICAL SHORT CUTS FOR YEARS.\nAND CLEARLY STATES THAT THE LOWER SHE SINKS, THE HIGHER SHE\nRISES IN THE ESTEEM OF HER FANS AND THOSE WHO BENEFIT FROM HER\nLARGESS -- >> WHAT HOMETOWN PAPER IS THAT,\n\"THE NEW YORK POST\"? >> THE ARKANSAS DEMOCRAT GAZETTE\nWHO HAVE COVERED THE CLINTONS FOR MANY YEARS, WHO UNDERSTAND\nTHIS IS THE TYPE OF ACTIVITY THEY'VE BEEN GETTING AWAY WITH\nFOR YEARS -- >> OKAY, ALICE, SO THE AP\nDOESN'T SAY PAY TO PLAY. >> YES, IT DOES NOT.\n>> -- IT LAYS OUT PART OF THE CALENDAR.\n>> JUST PART OF THE CALENDAR. >> AGAIN, OF THE BRIGHT\nMEETINGS. OF THE PRIVATE MEETINGS.\nOF THE PRIVATE MEETINGS, MORE THAN HALF WERE CLINTON DONORS.\nTHAT'S WHAT THE AP SAYS RIGHT THERE.\nSO JUST BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT IT SAYS.\nANDRE, I WANT YOU TO JUMP IN HERE, THOUGH, AND ABOUT THAT,\nABOUT THE LIMITATIONS OF WHAT THE AP REPORT HERE IS.\nIT'S NOT THE MAJORITY OF HER MEETINGS AS SECRETARY OF STATE.\nIT WAS THE MAJORITY OF HER MEETINGS WITH PRIVATE FOLKS.\nYOU COULD MEET THE CASE SHE'S MEETING WITH PEOPLE SHE'S KNOWN\nFOR A LONG TIME. SHE KNOWS PEOPLE WHO DONATE TO\nTHE FOUNDATION. IS THERE A -- ANY EVIDENCE OF\nILLEGAL GALT THERE? >> LOOK, IT WASN'T JUST TURNED\nOVER TO THE AP. THEY HAD TO SUE.\nIT TOOK THEM THREE YEARS TO GET THIS INFORMATION.\nIT'S NOT LIKE IT'S JUST OPEN FOR EVERYBODY TO SEE.\nIT JUST SHOWS HOW CROOKED GOVERNMENT IS AND IT SHOWS WHY\nTHERE'S SUCH DISTRUST. YOU KNOW, LOOK, PEOPLE WANT TO\nKNOW WHO THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S MEETING WITH.\nAND CLEEARLY IT'S OKAY FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO MEET WITH\nALL THESE FOLKS. >> GATES?\n>> ABSOLUTELY. BUT ANY OF THESE FOLKS.\nTHERE'S NO DEBATE ON THAT. THERE'S NO DEBATE THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION DOES WONDERFUL THINGS.\nTHE QUESTION IS, IS THERE PAY TO PLAY.\nDID SHE ONLY OPEN DOORS TO CERTAIN PEOPLE WHO GAVE MONEY?\nI THINK THE KING OF BAHRAIN COULDN'T GET A MEETING BUT AS\nTHE KING OF CASH AS A DONOR HE COULD GET A MEETING.\nTHERE'S A PROBLEM THERE. THE AP THIS ISN'T BREITBART,\nTHIS IS THE AP. HAS JUST POINTED OUT.\nWHO'S ABOUT AS FAR AS IT GETS. THAT SAYS, HEY, WAIT A MINUTE,\nWE'VE STUDIED THIS AND IT'S WRONG AND THEY KNEW THIS WAS\nGOING TO BE A PROBLEM WHEN SHE FIRST TOOK OFFICE --\n>> THE AP DIDN'T SAY IT WAS WRONG, THEY JUST SAID THEY\nSTUDIED IT AND PUBLISHED THE FACTS --\n>> OH, MIY GOD, FIRST OF ALL, O PAY TO PLAY, THIS IS A\nRIDICULOUS CHARGE. BECAUSE THE CLINTONS DID NOT\nRECEIVE ANY MONEY FROM THE FOUNDATION.\nTHEY SET UP THIS FOUNDATION TO DO GOOD WORK IN THE WORLD.\nSO IT'S RIDICULOUS CHARGE. AND THE IDEA THAT ANY TRUMP\nSUPPORTER -- I'M A BIG FAN OF ANDRE'S ON MANY LEVELS.\nTHE IDEA THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT TRANSPARENCY OR PAY TO PLAY WHEN\nHE WOULD NOT EVEN RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS.\nHE WOULD NOT TELL PEOPLE ANY ASPECT OF HIS FINANCIAL\nDEALINGS. AND WE JUST LEARNED THAT HE\nJACKED UP THE PRICES OF HIS RENT THAT HE COULD BENEFIT FROM OF\nTRUMP TOWERS THAT HE COULD BENEFIT FROM TO SOAK HIS DONORS\nDURING THIS CAMPAIGN. SO I THINK I HAVE TO SAY THIS IS\nA RIDICULOUS DOUBLE STANDARD AND I HOPE PEOPLE SEE THROUGH IT.\n>> I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TRANSPARENCY WHEN IT COMES TO\nDONALD TRUMP COMING UP IN A LITTLE BIT.\nI WANT TO FOCUS ON TRANSPARENCY WHEN IT COMES TO HIS POLICIES\nRIGHT NOW. HIS IMMIGRATION POLICY WHICH HAS\nBEEN THE CORNERSTONE OF HIS CAMPAIGN FOR LIKE 15, 16 MONTHS\nRIGHT NOW. UP UNTIL LAST WEEK, IT WAS A\nCERTAINTY THAT DONALD TRUMP SAID HE WANTED TO DEPORT THE 11\nMILLION UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS IN THIS COUNTRY.\nHE WANTED THEM TO GO. HE MADE THAT CRYSTAL CLEAR.\nNOW, IT'S NOT AS CRYSTAL CLEAR. NOW HE ADMITTED LAST NIGHT HE\nMIGHT BE WILLING TO SOFTEN HIS POSITION ON THE PRESENCE OF SOME\nOF THOSE WHO CONTRIBUTED TO SOCIETY.\nDO YOU SEE THIS AS A SHIFT? IF SO, WHY?\n>> CLEARLY, IT IS A SHIFT. BASED ON WHAT WE'RE HEARING.\nWE DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S GOING TO SAY BUT ALL INDICATIONS ARE HE\nIS SOFTENING HIS POSITION ON THIS.\nTHE DIFFICULTY IS, AS YOU INDICATED THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE\nPRIMARY PROCESS, HE WAS VERY HARD ON IMMIGRATION.\nTHIS WAS THE CORNERSTONE AND FOCUS OF HIS CAMPAIGN.\nHE PRIDED HIMSELF ON BRINGING THIS TO THE CONVERSATION, SAYING\nHE'S GOING TO BUILD A WALL, MEXICO WILL PAY FOR IT.\nAND NOW WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS HE'S SOFTENING ON THAT.\nLOOK, WE'VE SAID ALL ALONG, SINCE HE WON THE PRIMARY, HE HAS\nTO BROADEN HIS ELECTORATE TO BRING IN MORE PEOPLE IN ORDER TO\nWIN THE GENERAL WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO.\nIF HE'S GOING TO TWEAK IMMIGRATION, WHICH IS A KEY\nPOINT OF HIS CAMPAIGN, HE HAS TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T\nALIENATE A SPACE AND INFURIATE THOSE WHO VOTED FOR HIM ON THIS\nISSUE, BUT ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE NEEDS AND CONCERNS\nOF HISPANICS AND OTHERS WHO WANT TO SEE A MORE SOFTENED TONE ON\nIMMIGRATION. THAT'S GOING TO BE THE\nCHALLENGE. AND WHAT HE HAS TO DO WHEN HE'S\nROLLING OUT HIS NEW PROPOSALS FOR IMMIGRATION.\n>> ANDRE, CAN YOU TELL ME DEFINITIVELY AS WE SIT HERE\nRIGHT NOW WHETHER DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTS SOME KIND OF LEGAL\nSTATUS FOR SOME, EVEN A SMALL NUMBER, OF THE 11 MILLION\nUNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS WHO ARE IN THIS COUNTRY NOW?\n>> MY UNDERSTANDING IS, LOOK -- >> SO YES, HE IS FOR LEGAL\nSTATUS? >> YES.\n>> FOR WHOM EXACTLY? >> I THING IT GETS CAUGHT IN THE\nWEEDS BUT I THINK THE BIG PICTURE IS, LOOK WE KNOW DONALD\nTRUMP WANTS TO BUILD A WALL. BOTH ARE FOR SOME SORT OF\nLEGALIZED IMMIGRATION. I THINK SHE'S AGAINST THE WALL.\nHE'S FOR THE WALL. SHE'S FOR LETTING MORE SYRIAN\nREFUGEES IN THAT ARE UNVETTED. AND HE'S AGAINST THAT.\nTHERE ARE DIFFERENCES. LOOK, I THINK THE GREAT THING\nABOUT DONALD TRUMP IS HE'S SAYING I DON'T HAVE ALL THE\nANSWERS.

REPORTS THOSE 85 PEOPLE COMBINED GAVE AS MUCH AS\n$156 MILLION. TO BE CLEAR, THE A.P. REPORTS\nNOTHING ILLEGAL HAPPENED BUT PROVIDES MORE FUEL FOR CRITICS\nWHO CLAIM DONORS HAD SPECIAL ACCESS TO SECRETARY CLINTON.\nDONALD TRUMP FOR HIS PART HAS CALLED FOR THE FOUNDATION TO\nSHUT DOWN IMMEDIATELY AND LAST NIGHT HE CALLED AGAIN FOR A\nSPECIAL PROSECUTOR TO INVESTIGATE IT.\nDONALD TRUMP SAID IF PEOPLE CAN BUY OR SELL ACCESS TO THE OFFICE\nOF SECRETARY OF STATE, THE ENTIRE AMERICAN SYSTEM IS\nTHREATENED. >> IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FIGURE\nOUT WHERE THE CLINTON FOUNDATION ENDS AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT\nBEGINS.

THEY CHERRY PICKED DATA WHEN SHE\nWAS SECRETARY OF STATE AND TOOK ALL THE MEETINGS WHEN SHE WAS\nHERE WITH OFFICIALS IN THE U.S. AND FOREIGN LEADERS ABROAD, SOME\n1,700 MEETINGS AND SUBTRACTED THEM IN ORDER TO GET A VERY HIGH\nPERCENTAGE NUMBER TO TRY TO SUGGEST THAT SHE HAD TOO MANY\nMEETINGS WITH PEOPLE THAT HAD SOME AFFILIATION WITH THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION. >> I'LL ASK ABOUT THOSE\nSPECIALTIES MOMENT, AS WELL. WE'LL SPEAK WITH ONE OF THE\nASSOCIATED PRESS REPORTERS WHO BROKE THE STORY.\nFIRST REACTION FROM THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS FUNDRAISERS IN THE BAY AREA, AND JENNIFER\nGRIFFIN IS IN SAN FRANCISCO THIS AFTERNOON.\nJENNIFER?  CLINTON HAS NOT SPOKEN TO THE\nPRESS SINCE THAT A.P. STORY FIRST BROKE.\nSHE HASN'T SPOKEN TO THEM AT ALL DURING THIS FUNDRAISING SPREE\nHERE IN CALIFORNIA. SHE HASN'T HELD A PRESS\nCONFERENCE OF COURSE SINCE DECEMBER 4th.\nSHE'S BASICALLY LETTING HER CAMPAIGN MANAGER PUSH BACK ON\nTHE CAMPAIGN REPORTING. ONE POINT THEY HAVE MADE OF\nINTEREST IS THEY SAY IT IS UNFAIR TO INCLUDE THE MEETING\nWITH THE NOBEL WINNER OF BANGLADESH, WHO PROVIDES\nMICROLOANS TO WOMEN AND IS BEING THREATENED BY THE BANGLADESH I\nGOVERNMENT AT THE TIME SHE MET HIM.\nHE WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE FOUNDATION REGARDLESS OF THEIR\nRELATIONSHIP, SHEPARD. >> WHAT IS THE FUNDRAISING GOAL\nIN THE BAY AREA TODAY? >> Reporter: THE FUNDRAISING\nGOAL IS PRETTY LARGE. THERE ARE THREE FUNDRAISERS HERE\nIN THE BAY AREA. JUST YESTERDAY, SHE RAISED\n$6 MILLION IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA.\nSHE HAD THREE FUNDRAISERS IN THAT AREA, SO THE FIX\nFUNDRAISERS IN CALIFORNIA ALL TOGETHER HAS RAISED $6 MILLION\nIN THE LAST COUPLE DAYS. THE ONE -- ONE OF THE ONES HERE\nIN THE BAY AREA WILL BE AT APPLE CEO TIM COOK'S HOUSE.\nJOURNALISTS ARE NOT ALLOWED INTO THOSE FUNDRAISERS AND IN LOS\nANGELES, EACH PAID UNDER $33,000 TO ATTEND, THIS IS MONEY THAT'LL\nHELP THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, NOT JUST HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN.\nAUGUST HAS BEEN ABOUT HIGH DONORS LIKE THE $50,000 AHEAD\nDINNER IN CAPE COD, AND BEVERLY HILLS, WHEN SHE WAS COURTING\nBERNIE SANDERS VOTERS, WHEN 40% WAS MADE OF UP HER $62 MILLION\nCAMPAIGN HALL ALONE. JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE AND JESSICA\nBEAL'S HOLLYWOOD HOME, SHE RAISED THREE MILLION DOLLARS,\nAND THE CAMPAIGN IS HALFWAY TO ITS GOAL OF RAISING $1 BILLION\nFOR THE GENERAL ELECTION. >> JENNIFER LIVE ALONG THE SAN\nFRANCISCO BAY, THANK YOU.

TWO ITEMS WHICH SHOULD BE SEPARATE?\n>> YES. >> AND DURING THE COURSE OF THIS\nINVESTIGATION, YOU'RE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT NOTHING THAT THEY\nDID WAS ILLEGAL. COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT AND THE\nAGREEMENT THAT THEY HAD IN ADVANCE?\n>> YES. THEY CAME UP WITH AN AGREEMENT\nIN 2008 BEFORE BECOMING SECRETARY OF STATE IN THE CASE\nTHAT SHE DID, TO DISCLOSE THE DONORS TO THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION. AND JUST LAST WEEK, THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION CAME OUT AND THEY WERE GOING TO SEPARATE THE\nCLINTONS EVEN FURTHER FROM THEIR CHARITIES.\n>> YOU HEARD BRYAN FALLON SPEAKING WITH MSNBC'S ANDREA\nMITCHELL SUGGESTING THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF CHERRY PICKING AND\nTHE ENTIRE TIME OF SECRETARY CLINTON'S TENURE, SECRETARY OF\nSTATE WAS NOT INCLUDED. COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT?\n>> WE LOOKED AT ALL OF HER SCHEDULES.\nIN 2010 WE ASKED FOR HER CALENDARS AND WE DID NOT GET\nTHEM. WE HAD TO SUE THE STATE\nDEPARTMENT TO GET THOSE CALENDARS AND WE'RE STILL\nGETTING THEM. WHAT WE HAVE IS ABOUT HALF OF\nHER TIME THERE. >> AND WHAT -- BASED ON YOUR\nFINDINGS, WHAT WAS MOST SURPRISING TO YOU AS A REPORTER?\n>> JUST THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THIS CATEGORY OF PRIVATE\nINTEREST, WHO ALSO HAD A CONNECTION TO THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION. >> WAS IT PART OF YOUR REPORTING\nTO INQUIRE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS ANY ILLEGAL LEGAL\nACTIVITY HERE, AND IF SO, WHAT WERE YOUR FINDINGS?\n>> LIKE WE SAID, THERE DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE ANY VIOLATION OF AN\nETHICS AGREEMENT. ALL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THE\nACCESS. SHE HAS A CHOICE OF WHO SHE GETS\nTO SEE. SHE'S VERY BUSY AS SECRETARY OF\nSTATE. >> IS THIS COMMON PRACTICE?\nHAVE YOU DONE SIMILAR INVESTIGATES OF PREVIOUS\nSECRETARIES OF STATE, COLIN POWELL OR OTHERS?\n>> WE HAVE NOT DONE THE SAME THING.\n>> AND HOW DIFFICULT WAS THE ACCESS TO GET?\n>> WE HAD TO SUE THE STATE DEPARTMENT.\n>> AND WHAT WAS THE RESPONSE OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT?\nHOW SLOW DID IT COME?

IF YOU WERE A PRIVATE CITIZEN OR\nWORKED OUTSIDE THE GOVERNMENT AND MET WITH HILLARY CLINTON\nDURING HER TIME AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT, THE CHANCES ARE GOOD\nTHAT YOU DONATED TO HER FAMILY CHARITY.\nTHAT IS THE STUNNING CONCLUSION ACCORDING TO A NEW REPORT FROM\nTHE ASSOCIATED PRESS. THE FOLKS AT AP FINDING MORE\nTHAN HALF OF THE PEOPLE FROM PRIVATE INTERESTS WHO MET WITH\nCLINTON WHILE SHE WAS SERVING AS AMERICA'S TOP DIPLOMAT COUGHED\nSUPER RUSS DOUGH TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nTHE REACTION FROM REPUBLICANS, FURIOUS.\nRNC CHAIR REINCE PRIEBUS LIKE DONALD TRUMP THE STAY BEFORE\nCALLING FOR A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR TO LOOK AT THE APPEARANCE OF PAY\nTO PLAY. THE GOP NOMINEE SAYS LATEST\nREVELATIONS SHOW THE STATE DEPARTMENT WAS UP FOR SALE.\n>> THE NEW REVELATIONS ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S EMAIL SCANDAL\nMAKE CLEAR WE HAVE ONLY SEEN THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG.\nIT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE CLINTON FOUNDATION\nENDS AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT BEGINS.\n[. [SHOUTING]\nIT IS NOW ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THE CLINTONS SET UP A BUSINESS TO\nPROFIT FROM PUBLIC OFFICE. SANDRA: BUT THE CLINTON\nCAMPFIRING BACK. THEY'RE CALLING THE AP REPORT\nFLAWED AND CAMPAIGN MANAGER ROBBY MOOK ACCUSING THE NEWS\nAGENCY BEING SELECTIVE IN ITS FACT.\n>> BY OUR COUNT THERE WERE OVER 1700 OTHER MEETINGS THAT SHE\nHAD. SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE.\nSHE WAS MEETING WITH FOREIGN OFFICIALS AND GOVERNMENT\nOFFICIALS CONSTANTLY. SO TO PULL ALL OF THEM OUT OF\nTHE EQUATION, CHERRY-PICK A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF MEETINGS IS\nPRETTY OUTRAGEOUS. SANDRA: YET THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN\nCALLING THIS REPORT FLAW AND DISTORTED.\nWHAT DO YOU MAKE OF ALL THIS? >> WHAT THE ASSOCIATED PRESS DID\nTHEY LOOKED AT MEETINGS, HILLARY CLINTON WOULD BE UNLIKELY TO\nHAVE BUT FOR CLINTON FOUNDATION. THEY DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED\nTHINGS LIKE MEETING WITH FOREIGN DIPLOMATS SO THEY COULD ISOLATE\nTHESE. I WOULD BE CAREFUL IF I WERE THE\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN ASKING FOR MORE SCRUTINY ON WHICH FOREIGN\nREPRESENTATIVES HILLARY CLINTON MET WITH THAT ALSO CONTRIBUTED\nTO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION. WE'VE SEEN IN RECENT DAYS\nTHROUGH EMAILS THAT IS A RICH VARNAS WELL.\nSANDRA: MELISSA, YOU'RE BIG READER OF NEW YORK POST.\nDONORS SPECIAL ACCESS TO HILLARY DOUGH-NATION ON THE\n\"NEW YORK POST.\" MELISSA: WE'RE ASKED TO BELIEVE\nA COMPLETE COINCIDENCE HALF PEOPLE GOT OPTIONAL MEETINGS,\nMAKING DISTINCT SHUN, MEETINGS WITH HEAD OF OTHER COUNTRIES,\nTHAT WAS HER JOB. THOSE WERE MANDATORY.\nAP LOOKED AT REGULAR MEETINGS, LOBBYING WITH THE STATE\nDEPARTMENT, WHO HAD BUSINESS BEFORE THEM, NEEDED HELP.\nHALF OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT SHOWED UP BEGGED FOR A MEETING AND GOT\nIT HAD GIVEN MONEY TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nI WILL START TO THE FRANCIS FOUNDATION.\nIF YOU DONATE TO THE FRANCIS FOUNDATION, I WILL SAY NICE\nTHINGS ABOUT YOU ON NATIONAL TELEVISION.\nHOW WOULD THAT BE? PEOPLE WOULD LOOK AT IT THE SAME\nWAY. IT IS RIDICULOUS.\nHARRIS: THE FLIP SIDE WOULD BE REFLECTED IN POLICY.\nTHAT IS THE TRACK WE'RE TRYING TO FOLLOW NOW.\nNOT WHETHER OR NOT NICE THINGS WERE SAID BUT WERE THINGS LEFT\nOUT? YOU SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT BE ON A\nTERROR LIST, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?\nYOU HAVE TO KIND OF LOOK AT WHAT SOME OF THOSE COUNTRIES WHO HAVE\nHORRIBLE RECORDS WITH HUMAN RIGHTS, PARTICULARLY AMONG,\nAGAINST WOMEN AND CHILDREN, WHERE WERE THEY IN ALL OF THIS?\nSANDRA: MAKE FAN, I WANT TO -- MEGHAN I WANT TO BRING IN FROM\nCLINTON PRESS SECRETARY BRIAN FALLEN AND RESPONSE TO TRUMP.\nTRUMP DONATED TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION WHILE HRC WAS\nSECRETARY OF STATE. DOESN'T THAT MEAN HE IS CALLING\nFOR AN INVESTIGATION OF HIMSELF. MEGHAN: THAT IS SO STUPID.\nDONALD TRUMP ADMITTED HE DONATED TO HER CAMPAIGN AND TO HER\nBECAUSE HE WANTED ACCESS TO HER. IF YOU WANT ACCESS TO THE\nCLINTONS YOU GIVE THEM MONEY. THIS LINE, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO\nFIGURE OUT WHERE THE CLINTON FOUNDATION ENDS AND STATE\nDEPARTMENT BEGINS SHOULD BE BLASTED IN THEIR ATTACK ADS.\nPUT IT IN TIMES SQUARE IN GIANT LETTERS.\nOF ALL THE ATTACKS ON HILLARY CLINTON THIS IS THE MOST\nEFFECTIVE. I HAVE GOTTEN MORE TEXT MESSAGES\nOF FRIENDS WHO DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO POLITICS ABSOLUTELY\nENGAGED WHAT IS HAPPENING. THIS IS SLOW DRIP, DRIP THAT\nWILL KEEP COMING OUT AND GET WORSE.\n>> IT IS EFFECTIVE IN PARTICULAR FOR TWO REASONS.\nONE, THIS IS THE HISTORY OF HOW CLINTONS OPERATED.\nSANDRA: RIGHT. >> YOU GO BACK TO LOOK IN THE\n1990S, LOOK WHEN SHE WAS SENATOR, THERE WAS A PAY FOR\nPLAY ASPECT TO A LOT WHAT THE CLINTONS DID BACK THEN.\nTHERE IS A HISTORY. THAT LINE RESONATES IN\nPARTICULAR. ALSO IT IS EFFECTIVE HILLARY\nCLINTON SAID IN JULY OF THIS YEAR THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO\nCONNECTION, THAT IS DIRECT QUOTE, ABSOLUTELY NO CONNECTION\nBETWEEN WORK SHE DID AS SECRETARY OF STATE AND CLINTON\nFOUNDATION. WE NOW KNOW THAT WAS NOT TRUE.\nWE KNOW PEOPLE WERE GIVEN MEETINGS BECAUSE THEY WERE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION DONORS. THEY COULDN'T GET THEM THROUGH\nOFFICIAL CHANNELS BUT COULD GET THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION DONORS. WE KNOW THAT IS A CASE WITH\nNUMBER OF PEOPLE. QUESTION IS HOW MANY PEOPLE AND\nHOW MUCH DID THEY GET. SANDRA: REINCE PRIEBUS IS\nCALLING ON HILLARY CLINTON AND HER TEAM TO HOLD A PRESS\nCONFERENCE AND ADDRESS ALL OF THIS IN THE FOUNDATION SCANDAL,\nHIGHLIGHTING IN THE PRESS RELEASE HE IS CALLING FOR HER TO\nDO THIS, STREAK OF 263 DAYS, HARRIS SHE STILL HAS NOT HELD A\nPRESS CONFERENCE. HARRIS: WHAT IS INTERESTING\nABOUT THAT, THAT WOULD HAVE SPECIFICITY OF THIS ISSUE.\nAT LEAST AT MOST NEWS CONFERENCE YOU MIGHT GET A COUPLE OF\nSOFTBALLS. NOW THEY'RE COMING ACROSS THE\nPLATE WITH A LOST SPEED. HOW MANY DAYS?\nSANDRA: 263. HARRIS: OKAY.\nWE WANT TO GET BACK TO OUR TOP STORY ON THE SITUATION WE'RE\nLEARNING MORE IN KABUL. THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF\nAFGHANISTAN WE'RE TOLD IS UNDER ATTACK.\nTHE POLICE FORCE, THE KABUL'S RAPID REACTION POLICE FORCE\nSAYS, QUOTE, WE ARE DEALING WITH A COMPLEX ATTACK INSIDE OF THE\nAMERICAN UNIVERSITY. SPECIAL FORCESSEN ROUT.\nWE HAVE NOT HEARD CONFIRMED REPORTS OF INJURIES OR WORSE IN\nALL OF THIS BUT AGAIN CLAIMS HAVE ESTIMATED 1700 STATUTES\nENROLLED THERE. THIS IS, TWO OF THE EMPLOYEES\nWE'RE TOLD, AN AMERICAN AND AUSTRALIAN, TWO OF THE\nEMPLOYEES, WERE KIDNAPPED AT GUNPOINT IN THE CAPITOL OF KABUL\nBY MEN IN MILITARY UNIFORMS AS THEY TRAVELED BETWEEN THE CAMPUS\nAND THEIR HOME. THAT WAS BACK ON AUGUST 7th.\nTHIS AREA HAS BEEN IN THE NEWS IN RECENT WEEKS.\nBUT NOW WE'RE TOLD SUSPECTED MILITANTS ARE HITTING AMERICAN\nUNIVERSITY, UNDER ATTACK IN KABUL.\nWE'LL UPDATE YOU AS WE LEARN MORE.\nSTAY CLOSE.",

SO, THERE ARE STUDENTS AND\nFACULTY ON-SITE. WHEN THE AFGHAN SPECIAL FORCES\nENTERED THE COMPOUND, BY THE WAY, THEY ARE IN BOTH COMPOUNDS\nRIGHT NOW, THE UNIVERSITY AND THE SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND WHICH\nIS ADJACENT TO IT, AMANAGED TO FREE SOME OF THE STUDENTS AND\nFACULTY WHO WERE SHELTERING IN BUILDINGS THERE, BUT IT IS STILL\nAN ONGOING SITUATION. >> WITHOUT KNOWING ANYTHING FOR\nSURE, IN A BROADER CONTEXT, WHY DO YOU THINK THIS SCHOOL COULD\nBE A TARGET? >> IT'S THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY\nIN KABUL. IT HAS LONG BEEN A TARGET.\nNEVER BEEN ATTACKED LIKE THIS, BUT JUST RECENTLY, TWO\nPROFESSORS, AN AMERICAN AND AN AUSTRALIAN, WERE KIDNAPPED.\nAND THEY WERE TEACHING AT THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY.\nTHE TALIBAN HAS, WOULD BE INTERESTED IN ATTACKING THIS\nLOCATION. ISIS, WHICH IS ALSO HAD A\nPRESENCE IN AFGHANISTAN WOULD BE INTERESTED IN ATTACKING THE\nAMERICAN UNIVERSITY. SO FAR, NO CLAIM OR\nRESPONSIBILITY, BUT PEOPLE I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO SAY THE\nSUSPICION IS MORE TO THE, FOR THE TALIBAN BASED ON THE NATURE\nOF THE ATTACK. >> SINCE THE CAMPUS IS BASICALLY\nIN OR CLOSE TO THE CENTER OF THE CITY AND IT IS AS YOU SAID, HIGH\nSECURITY. IF THEY'RE NOT SAFE, IS THERE\nANY AREA WITHIN KABUL THAT IS? >> PROBABLY NOT.\nFOR A DELIBERATE ATTACK. THEY DIDN'T GO FOR THE GATE,\nTHEY WENT FOR A SECTION OF THE WALL.\nSO THEY'VE DECIDED TO FIGHT THEIR WAY IN AND BLAST THEIR WAY\nIN. THERE IS A LOT OF SECURITY AT\nTHIS FACILITY.

WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN LEARNING\nABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN AFGHANISTAN?\n>> WELL, I'VE BEEN ABLE TO SPEAK TO VERY CLOSE RELATIVE AND MANY\nOF MY FRIENDS WHO ARE THERE AND HEARD A VERY HUGE EXPLOSION WHEN\nTHEY WERE INSIDE THEIR CLASSROOMS FOLLOWED BY GUNFIRE.\nIN THE LAST 20 MINUTES OR SO ONE OF MY RELATIVES CONFIRMED THE\nATTACKERS WERE TOSSING HAND GRENADES.\nTHEY HAD RED BALLS.

SOME OF THEM JUMPING ON THE\nWALLS, GOING TO PEOPLE'S HOMES. THIS IS STILL AN ONGOING\nSITUATION. MEMBERS OF THE AFGHAN SPECIAL\nFORCES FROM THE CRISIS RESPONSE UNIT, A SPECIAL FORCES UNIT\nTHAT'S TRAINED TO FIND ATTACKS LIKE THIS IS ON THE GROUND, AND\nAS WE SPEAK, IT'S STILL AN ONGOING SITUATION.\nBUT THIS IS AN ATTACK ON AFGHANISTAN'S FUTURE.\nTHIS IS AN ATTACK ON A SYMBOL OF AMERICAN/AFGHAN RELATIONSHIP\nSINCE THE FALL OF TALIBAN, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA HAVE\nOPENED THIS UNIVERSITY THAT IS EDUCATING A FUTURE GENERATION OF\nAFGHAN LEADERS. WE'RE REALLY SEEING SENIOR\nGOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN STUDYING AT THE\nAMERICAN UNIVERSITY, BUT THEY'RE ALSO RUNNING KEY GOVERNMENT\nOFFICES. I CAN ALSO CONFIRM THAT YOU TO\nAT LEAST TWO AMERICAN CITIZENS HAVE MANAGED TO ESCAPE FROM THAT\nATTACK AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, MOST OF THE FAMILIES ARE STILL\nWORRIED. NO ONE REALLY BELIEVED THAT\nTHEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS COULD BE AT RISK, ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY\nARE INSIDE THEIR CLASSROOMS.

AT LEAST FIVE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN\nINJURED. A POLICE OPERATION IS SET TO\nLAUNCH VERY SHORTLY SEARCHING THIS CAMPUS FOR ANY SUSPECTED\nATTACKERS, GUNMEN. THIS IS THE VERY SAME UNIVERSITY\nWHERE JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO TWO LECTURERS WERE KIDNAPPED AT\nGUNPOINT RIGHT FROM THEIR CAR. IN FACT, ONE OF THEM WAS AN\nAMERICAN. SO LET'S BEGIN OUR COVERAGE WITH\nOUR REPORTER COVERING THE STORY FOR US.\nIS THIS A HOSTAGE SITUATION?

BUT WE HAVE REPORTS OF STUDENTS\nAND FACULTY MEMBERS STILL TRAPPED WITHIN THAT CAMPUS.\nIT TOOK HOURS FOR SECURITY FORCES EVEN JUST TO BE ABLE TO\nBREAK THROUGH THE PARAMETER OF THE UNIVERSITY AND GET INSIDE\nTHE UNIVERSITY ITSELF. THEY ARE NOW INSIDE THE\nUNIVERSITY BUT WE DON'T KNOW AS YET IF THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO\nEVEN ENGAGE WITH THE ATTACKERS. FORTUNATELY, OVER 100 PEOPLE ARE\nNOW BEING REPORTED AS HAVING ESCAPED.\nTHEY BRING WITH THEM SOME PRETTY HORRIFYING DETAILS, BROOKE.\nGRENADES BEING THROWN. STUDENTS BEING CHASED.\nTHE TWEETS THAT WERE COMING OUT OF THERE MADE VERY DIFFICULT\nREADING. \"PLEASE, SOMEONE, ANYONE, COME\nHELP US.\" AND THIS WENT ON FOR HOURS.\nAND AS YET, SECURITY FORCES HAVEN'T ACTUALLY MANAGED TO\nLOCATE IN WHICH PARTS OF THE CAMPUS THE ATTACKERS HAVE\nSITUATED THEMSELVES.

THE REPORTER FOR CBS NEWS SAYING\nHE AND HIS FRIENDS ESCAPED BUT SEVERAL OTHER FRIEND AND\nPROFESSOR WERE TRAPPED INSIDE.

JUST ONE STORY OF POTENTIALLY\nDOZENS OF HUNDREDS. THIS PERSON HAPPENED TO BE A\nJOURNALIST THERE. A PULITZER-PRIZED WINNING\nPHOTOGRAPHER WHO WORKED FOR THE AP AT THE TIME.\nTHIS IS JUST ONE PERSON SEEKING HELP VIA TWITTER AT THIS MOMENT\nAND MAY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ESCAPE.\n>> ALL TOO FAMILIAR WE ARE HEARING FIRSTHAND LIVE ACCOUNTS\nTHROUGH TWITTER.

ACTIVITY OUTSIDE OF THE AMERICAN\nUNIVERSITY AND THIS LOOKS TO BE POTENTIALLY THE INSIDE OF AN\nAMBULANCE, POTENTIALLY -- >> THINK ABOUT NIGHT TIME THERE.\nSTUDENT TAKING NIGHT TIME CLASSES AND STUDYING IN WHAT\nTHEY FELT WAS A RELATIVELY SAFE SPACE.\n>> WE ARE WORKING TO GET SATELLITE IMAGERY IN QUICKLY.\nI'VE GOT TO HARKEN BACK IT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO WITH THE\nKIDNAPPING OF TWO PROFESSORS. ONE AMERICAN, ONE AUSTRALIAN.\nBOTH KIDNAPPED OUTSIDE OF THIS FACILITY.\nTHE FACILITY ITSELF WAS SHUT DOWN.\nOPERATIONS WERE SHUT DOWN ONLY TO BE OPENED UP THE FOLLOWING\nWEDNESDAY. SO PRESUMABLY OPERATIONS WERE AS\nPER USUAL AT THIS UNIVERSITY WHEN THIS ATTACK BEGAN.\nWE ARE JOINED ON THE PHONE BY FREELANCE JOURNALIST WHO IS IN\nKABUL. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US THUS FAR\nABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING AT THE UNIVERSITY?\n>>. [ INAUDIBLE ]\n>> ZAKARIA, CAN YOU STILL HEAR ME?\nWE HAVE LOST YOU. CAN YOU REPEAT WHAT YOU WERE\nSAYING? I THINK WE MAY HAVE LOST HIS\nSIGNAL. IF WE COULD JUST REESTABLISH\nTHAT SIGNAL AND MAYBE TAP INTO WHAT ZAKARIA KNOWS ABOUT THE\nATTACK. MEANTIME, FORMER FBI ASSISTANT\nDIRECTOR TOM FUENTES IS WITH ME AS WELL.\nRICK, BE IT IN A CITY, KABUL, ELITE UNIVERSITY, IT IS STILL A\nWAR ZONE. STILL DANGEROUS TO MOVE FREELY\nAROUND KABUL AS IS EVIDENCED BY WHAT HAPPENED THREE WEEKS AGO\nWITH THE KIDNAPPINGS. I'M INTERESTED TO FIND OUT THEY\nREOPENED OPERATIONS THERE. WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT\nIN THAT THIS RESULTED JUST WEEKS LATER?\n>> YEAH. HERE'S THE PROBLEM.\nONCE YOU HAVE ONE OF THESE INSTANCES, YOUR IMMEDIATE\nRESPONSE IS TO RAMP UP SECURITY. YOU CAN ONLY MAINTAIN THAT FOR\nSO LONG AND PRETTY SOON IT TAPERS OFF WHEN NOTHING ELSE\nHAPPENED YOU RELAX THAT AND GET BACK INTO A NORMAL POSTURE.\nIF YOU'RE THE TALIBAN AND WHATEVER FWRUP CONDUCTED THIS\nOPERATION, YOU WAIT UNTIL SECURITY GETS BACK DOWN TO A\nLEVEL YOU THINK CAN YOU EXPLOIT. >> SO TOM FUENTES, WE KNOW SO\nLITTLE ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING. WE KNOW THERE ARE EXPLOSIONS.\nWE KNOW THIS FIRE IS BURNING OUT OF CONTROL AT THIS POINT.\nSO MUCH SO THAT FIRST RESPONDER CAN'T GET IN.\nTHEY CAN'T GET ACCESS TO RESCUE THOSE WHO MAY BE TRAPPED INSIDE.\nTHIS IS A REALLY COMPLEX QUESTION GIVEN WE CAN'T SEE THE\nAREA JUST YET BUT WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THOSE FIRST\nRESPONDERS AND WITH THOSE ELITE FORCES WHO ARE THEN NOW TRYING\nTO COMBAT TERRORISTS AND RESCUE THOSE WHO ARE IN A BURNING\nBUILDING? >> THAT'S THE PROBLEM, ASHLEY.\nTHE FACT THAT THERE IS A BURNING BUILDING.\nTHE FACT THAT YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT NEED TO BE RESCUED AND\nMEDICALLY TAKEN CARE OF AND THAT MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR ANY\nKIND OF COUNTER ASSAULT, SAY ON THE FACILITY, TO GO AFTER\nWHOEVER IS HOLDING THEM HOSTAGE. YOU HAVE ALREADY HAD GUNFIRE.\nALREADY HAD EXPLOSIVES. AND ANY ATTEMPT TO GO IN THERE\nWILL PROBABLY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL GUNFIRE AND\nCASUALTIES AND THEY WILL HAVE TO WEIGH THAT WHETHER AGAINST THE\nFACT OF DOING NEXT TO NOTHING AND JUST WAITING UNTIL A BETTER\nTIME. THERE'S GOING TO BE NO REAL\nNEGOTIATING WITH THE PEOPLE DOING THIS.\nTHEY TYPICALLY ARE ON A SUICIDE MISSION AND WON'T CARE.\nTHAT MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT TO RESOLVE THE SITUATION WITHOUT\nFURTHER INNOCENT LOSS OF LIFE. >> AND RICK FRANCONA, THERE ARE\nRECURRING INSTANCES OF THE TACTICS WHERE THE TERRORIST\nATTACKS ARE CONCERNED, SECONDARY ATTACKS.\nFIRST EXPLOSIONS GO OFF. FIRST GUNFIRE IS HEARD.\nAND THERE'S A LULL SO SECURITY FORCES AND FIRST RESPONDERS CAN\nCOME IN AND THEN THE SECONDARY ATTACKS BEGIN.\nI CAN ONLY ASSUME THEY ARE ALL TOO AWARE OF THAT WHEN\nRESPONDING IN A CITY LIKE KABUL. >> YEAH.\nTHIS IS WHAT IS GOING THROUGH CALCULUS RIGHT NOW AS TO WHAT WE\nDO. SPECIAL FORCES ARE ON THE SCENE\nAND THEY HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION.\nAS TOM SAID, DO WE MOUNTAIN ATTACK NEW OR WAIT UNTIL THE\nSITUATION STABILIZES. THE CURRENT THOUGHT IS THAT\nLONGER YOU WAIT, THE MORE CASUALTIES YOU TAKE.\nBUT THEY HAVE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON SO THEY\nHAVE TO SECURE THE PERIMETER BEFORE THEY WORK ON WHAT IS\nGOING ON INSIDE THE PERIMETER. >> ALL THOSE PEOPLE HOLED UP\nINSIDE AND SENDING TWEETS OF THEIR TERROR, INDICATING HOW\nFEARFUL THEY ARE. YOU HAVE BEEN WATCHING TWEETS\nCOME IN. I NEED TO KNOW WHEN YOU HEAR\nFROM THAT -- >> UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS NO\nWORD. ONE OF THE ONLY PEOPLE THERE\nTWEETING IN ENGLISH. WE HAVE SEEN OTHER PEOPLE\nPOSTING LANGUAGES AND OTHER PEOPLE POSTING FROM AT LEAST 10\nMINUTES AGO. SO IT IS AN ONFGOING SITUATION.\nTHE PULITZER PRIZE WINNING PHOTOGRAPHER, WELL KNOWN AMONG\nAFGHAN JOURNALISTS, POSTING 75 MINUTES AGO, THAT HE NEEDED\nHELP, HE HEARD EXPLOSIONS AND THIS WOULD BE HIS LAST POST HE\nCOULD PUT ON FACEBOOK AND TWITTER.\nMY UNDERSTANDING IS HE IS OKAY BUT NEEDING MEDICAL ATTENTION.\n>> WE WILL CONTINUE TO WATCH WHAT THE DEVELOPMENTS ARE.\nIN THE MEANTIME IF I COULD ASK TOM FUENTES, THIS IS AN\nINTERNATIONAL STUDENT BODY, REPRESENTED BY DOZENS OF BODIES.\nCLEARLY THERE IS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT LANGUAGES SPOKEN.\nA NUMBER OF CULTURES REPRESENTED.\nPEOPLE WILL LOOK PARTICULARLY DIFFERENT.\nTHAT MUST ALSO PRESENT A CHALLENGE FOR THOSE TRYING TO\nCOMMUNICATE FROM THE OUTSIDE TO RESCUE THEM.\n>> THAT'S TRUE. BUT I THINK THE MAIN CHALLENGE\nFOR AUTHORITIES WHO HAVE THE FACILITIES SURROUNDING IT IS TO\nFIND OUT EXACTLY HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE INSIDE THAT WILL BE THE\nENEMY. WHAT KIND OF WEAPONRY DO THEY\nHAVE. HOW MANY WITH GUNS.\nWHAT TYPE OF GUNS. WHERE ARE THEY LOCATED WITHIN\nTHE FACILITY IF THAT CAN BE DETERMINED.\nSO THERE IS A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT THEY STILL WANT TO GET\nBEFORE THEY CHARGE IN THERE. AND YOU'RE RIGHT, BESIDES\nCOMMUNICATING WITH DIFFERENT STUDENTS IN THERE THE QUESTION\nWOULD BE, THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY DO MOST OF THEM SPEAK\nENGLISH AND THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO BE CONTACTED OVER ENGLISH\nSOCIAL NETWORKS. THAT MAY BE ONGOING NOW.\nWE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE. BUT THE CHALLENGE IS FOR\nAUTHORITIES TO FIGURE OUT WHAT POINT DOES WAITING RESULT IN\nMORE CASUALTIES AND THEY HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO MAKE AN ASSAULT\nAND TRY TO RESCUE AS MANY AS POSSIBLE.\n>> AGAIN, JUST TO YOU KNOW, REITERATE OUR BREAKING NEWS THAT\nHAS JUST BEEN HAPPENING IN THE LAST HOUR, GUNFIRE EXPLOSIONS\nHEARD AT KABUL UNIVERSITY. IF THAT'S FAMILIAR TO YOU, IT IS\nBECAUSE ONLY THREE WEEKS AGO WE BROUGHT YOU THE STORY OF A\nFRIGHTENING KIDNAPPING THAT HAPPENED OUTSIDE THAT CAMPUS.\nAN AMERICAN AND AUSTRALIAN. TWO OF THEM PROFESSORS THAT\nUNIVERSITY KIDNAPPED. THEIR WHEREABOUTS ARE UNKNOWN.\nNOW SEVERAL WEEKS LATER AFTER THE UNIVERSITY CLOSED AND\nREOPENED OPERATIONS, NOW COMES THE NEWS OF THIS TERRIFYING\nSITUATION AND THE FIRES APPARENTLY BURNING SO BADLY AT\nTHIS POINT THAT POLICE AND FIRST RESPONDERS CANNOT EVEN ENTER\nTHIS COMPLEX AT THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY AT KABUL.\nWE WILL CONTINUE TO WATCH. AS WE GET INFORMATION AND MORE\nIMAGES IN FROM THE UNIVERSITY WE WILL BRING YOU UP TO SPEED ON\nTHAT. WE ARE ALSO WATCHING ANOTHER\nDISASTER THAT'S BEEN UNRAVELING IN CENTRAL ITALY.\nA PLACE THAT TYPICALLY DELIGHTS WITH ITS IMAGES IS HAUNTING US.\nPHOTOGRAPHS COMING OUT OF ITALY WRACKED WITH AN EARTHQUAKE.\nABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING.

NOW EPIPEN'S MANUFACTURER IS\nFACING GROWING OUTRAGE FOLLOWING SEVERAL STEEP PRICE INCREASES ON\nHIS LIFE-SAVING PRODUCTS. >> IN 2010, THE PRICE WAS $150.\nTHEN 300, 400, 500, AND NOW WITH A NEAR MONOPOLY, $608.\nTHE CEO'S COMPENSATION HAS GREW NEARLY 700% OVER THE TIME.\nNEVERTHELESS, MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ARE CALLING ON MYLAN TO\nEXPLAIN ITSELF, WHICH COULD GET AWKWARD FOR CEO HEATHER BRESH,\nGIVEN SHE'S THE DAUGHTER OF JOE MANCHIN OF WEST VIRGINIA.\nBUT PERHAPS ALL IS NOT LOST FOR THE DRUG COMPANY.\nMYLAN GOT A RIGOROUS DEFENSE THIS WEEK.\n>> MARTIN 64ELY IS UNDER INDICTMENT FOR SECURITIES FRAUD.\nTODAY HE DEFENDED MYLAN. >> MILEAN'S A GOOD GUY, THEY\nHAVE ONE PRODUCT WHERE THEY WERE FINALLY STARTING TO MAKE A\nLITTLE BIT OF MONEY AND",

MEG TIRRELL JOINS US WITH MORE.\nWE'RE WAITING FOR THE INTERVIEW WITH HEATHER BRESCH COMING UP\nTHIS MORNING. >> AT 8:30.\nMYLAN IS RESPONDING AFTER THE BACKLASH.\nTHEY WILL PROVIDE UP TO $300 FOR CERTAIN PATIENTS FOR THEIR OUT\nOF POCKET COSTS AT THE PHARMACY. ALSO INCREASING THE\nELIGIBILITY -- DOUBLING THE ELIGIBILITY FOR PATIENT WHO IS\nCAN GET PATIENT ASSISTANCE FROM THE COMPANY, HELP PAYING FOR\nTHEIR EPI-PENS. NOW TO 400% OF THE FEDERAL\nPOVERTY LEVEL. ALSO SEEING THEY'RE OPENING A\nPATHWAY SO PATIENTS CAN ORDER DIRECTLY FROM THE COMPANY\nREDUCING THE COST. INTERESTINGLY THEY'RE NOT\nLOWERING THE PRICE OF THE DRUG, THEY'RE JUST INCREASING THE\nPATIENCE ASSISTANCE THEY'RE GIVING ON THE DRUG.\nAND ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS YOU HEAR FROM THE PHARMACEUTICAL\nINDUSTRY AROUND DRUG PRICES IS THAT THE LIST PRICE THAT WE SEE\nISN'T THE REAL PRICE. AND MYLAN COMING OUT WITH AN\nINTO GRAPHIC THIS MORNING SHOWING WHAT CHUNK IS COMING OUT\nTO THE MIDDLE MEN. YOU SEE IT HERE.\nON THE RIGHT IS WHAT'S GOING TO PATIENTS IS THE $806 LIST PRICE.\nWHAT THEY GET ON THE LEFT IS IN SALES.\nTHE NET PRICE IS ACTUALLY $274. THAT'S WHAT MYLAN IS GETTING OUT\nOF THE $608 LIST PRICE. IN THE MIDDLE THEY SAY $334 OF\nEACH PACK OF THESE EPI-PENS ARE GOING TO PHARMACY BENEFIT\nMANAGERS AND WHOLESALERS AND THEN THE PHARMACY RETAILERS\nTHEMSELVES. THIS IS THE ARGUMENT THE DRUG\nINDUSTRY MAKES THAT THE LIST PRICE IS NOT THE REAL PRICE.\nUSUALLY WE DON'T GET ANY TRANSPARENCY ON WHAT THE ACTUAL\nMIDDLE MEN PRICE IS. >> THAT'S INTERESTING TO HAVE\nTHAT BREAKDOWN. I MEAN, THEY ARE GETTING, LIKE,\nA FULL HALF OF THAT. BUT THAT IS THEIR RIGHT AS THE\nMANUFACTURER OF THIS. BUT I'M WONDERING WHAT THE BEST\nNEWS FOR INVESTORS WOULD BE. BECAUSE THE STOCK IS DOWN 11%\nTHIS WEEK BECAUSE THE EXPECTATION WAS WITH ALL OF THE\nPOLITICAL PRESSURE, THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DECREASE THE\nPRICE. THEIR MARGINS WOULD BE HURT BY\nTHAT. NOW ON THIS NEWS THAT THEY'RE\nSORT OF SHOULDERING SOME OF THE COST, THE STOCK IS UP AS MUCH AS\n4% THIS MORNING. WHAT DO PEOPLE WANT HERE?\n>> YOU'RE SEEING A BIT OF A POP ON THIS.\nNOT RECOVERING EVERYTHING THEY LOST HERE.\nBUT I IMAGINE INVESTORS ARE A LITTLE BIT RELIEVED TO SEE THEM\nCOME OUT WITH A STRONG RESPONSE, TO SEE THEM TAKING THIS HEAD ON,\nTO BE TRYING TO NIP THIS IN THE BUD.\nTHERE ARE SOME ANALYST REPORTS OUT SAYING THE IMPACT ON THE\nSTOCK IS MUCH GREATER THAN THE IMPACT ON THE EPI-PEN AS A\nRESULT OF THIS. >> WE NEED A COUPLE OF\nCOMPETITORS TO TEST THAT. TO PUSH ON THAT AND SAY WE CAN\nDO IT WITH THOSE MIDDLE MEN WE CAN STILL DO IT FOR HERE.\nTHEN THE NEXT GUY COMES IN AND SAYS WE CAN EVEN DO IT FOR HERE\nBECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS BETTER.\n>> THAT'S RIGHT. AND BERNSTEIN ACTUALLY SAYING\nALL OF THIS ATTENTION COULD BE FURTHER BAD FOR MYLAN BECAUSE IT\nCOULD SPUR THE FDA TO FAST TRACK THE COMPETITORS.\n>> THERE'S ALWAYS A GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT IN ALL OF THESE.\n\"NEW YORK TIMES,\" IT'S JUST CLEAR AS CAN BE THAT IT'S GREEDY\nDRUG COMPANIES. THAT'S A KNEE JERK CONVENTIONAL\nIDEA. >> THERE'S A LOT OF GOVERNMENT\nINVOLVEMENT IN THE EPI-PEN. MYLAN IS PUSHING ON AIRPLANES.\n>> THIS IS GENERIC. GETTING AN EPI-PEN IS NOT\nDISCOVERING A CURE FOR CANCER OR SOMETHING.\nTHIS CAN BE DONE. AND THESE WEIRD LAWS THAT IT HAS\nTO BE SIMILAR BUT. -- OR IT HAS TO BE IDENTICAL,\nRIGHT? >> PRETTY MUCH.\n>> HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT MYLAN OR OTHER LOBBYING TO MAKE SURE\nTHAT SCHOOLS AND AIRPLANES AND OTHERS ARE ACTUALLY FORCED TO\nHAVE EPI-PENS IN THEIR -- >> BECAUSE THAT'S MORE --\n>> THAT'S MORE BUSINESS. >> SO THEY USE THE GOVERNMENT\nFOR -- THAT'S LIKE -- >> RIGHT.\nTHAT'S THE CRONY CAPITALISM. >> BUT IT'S NOT A BAD IDEA TO\nHAVE THEM AROUND ERIC STOLZ WAS HAPPY HE HAD THAT.\nAND THAT WAS AN EPI -- >> ERIC STOLZ THE ACTOR.\n>> SCOTT TWEETED THAT -- >> YOU KNOW HE'S OUR \"PULP\nFICTION\" EXPERT. >> HAD THAT AT THE READY.\n>> HE'S GOING TO BE ON.

THIS COMES JUST MINUTES AFTER\nHILLARY CLINTON PUT OUT A STATEMENT SAYING, QUOTE, THAT\nSHE'S MADE CLEAR THAT PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS\nSHOULD BE REQUIRED TO EXPLAIN SIGNIFICANT PRICE INCREASES AND\nPROVE THAT ANY ADDITIONAL COSTS ARE LINKED TO ADDITIONAL\nBENEFITS AND BETTER VALUE. SINCE THERE'S NO APPARENT\nJUSTIFICATION IN THIS CASE, SHE SAYS SHE'S CALLING ON MYLAN TO\nIMMEDIATELY REDUCE THE PRICE OF EPIPENS.\nAND JUST AFTER CLINTON PUT OUT THAT STATEMENT, A LETTER WAS\nSENT BY THE SENATE AGING COMMITTEE TO MYLAN CEO HEATHER\nBRESCH ASKING THEY PROVIDE ANY ANALYSIS USED BY MYLAN RELATING\nTO THE PRICING OR MARKET SHARE OF EPIPEN SINCE 2007 WHEN MYLAN\nACQUIRED IT, ALONG WITH ANY INFORMATION REVIEWED OR\nGENERATED BY MYLAN'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS RELATING TO THE DRUG\nOVER THE SAME PERIOD. THEY SAY WE ASK THAT YOU PROVIDE\nA BRIEFING TO COMMITTEE STAFF ON THE PRICING OF EPIPEN AT A\nMUTUALLY CONVENIENT TIME NO LATER THAN TWO WEEKS FROM TODAY.\nNOW, WE REACHED OUT TO MYLAN ABOUT THIS.\nTHEY JUST SENT US A STATEMENT BACK.\nTHEY SAID WE'VE REACHED OUT TO EVERY MEMBER OF CONGRESS WHO\nSENT US A LETTER.

VALEANT.\n>> MEG, THANK YOU. SO WHAT IS THE SOLUTION TO\nKEEPING DRUG PRICES DOWN? COST CONTROL OR FREE MARKETS?\nLET'S BRING IN PAUL HOWARD, SENIOR FELLOW AT MANHATTAN\nINSTITUTE, PAUL WEISSMAN, PAUL, I'LL START WITH YOU.\nTHE STORY HAS MOVED VERY, VERY QUICKLY IN TERMS OF\nDEVELOPMENTS. I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOU THINK\nTHAT THE ROOT OF THE MATTER IS REALLY BEING IGNORED HERE.\nI MEAN, IT'S INTERESTING YOU SEE SO MANY SENATORS CALL OUT YOU\nWANT TO ADDRESS A SPECIFIC PROBLEM, BUT NOBODY IS GETTING\nAT THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM WHICH COULD BE THE SLOW FDA APPROVAL\nPROCESS. >> ABSOLUTELY.\nSO WHAT YOU WANT IS YOU WANT MULTIPLE COMPETITORS IN A MARKET\nKIND OF CHECK PRICE INCREASES AND KEEP DELIVERING VALUE TO\nCONSUMERS. SO YOU GOT TO THINK ABOUT WHERE\nTHE OTHER COMPETITORS ARE. AND IF IT TAKES MULTIPLE YEARS\nAND MANY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO COME TO MARKET, YOU'RE DETERRING\nCOMPETITION. SO YEARS AGO WE NEED TO THINK\nABOUT WHERE THE COMPETITORS TODAY LOOKING FORWARD GET THOSE\nCOMPETITORS INTO THE MARKET HELP TO BRING DOWN PRICES.\n>> ROBERT, WHERE DO YOU STAND ON THIS?\nI MEAN, I WOULD ASSUME THAT YOU THINK ALL THESE CALLS AND ALL\nTHE OUTRAGE IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, BUT ARE YOU\nAFRAID THAT AFTER MYLAN IS EITHER FORCED OR MANDATED TO\nLOWER THE PRICE ON THE EPIPEN THAT EVERYBODY GOES AWAY?\nTHEY RETREAT AND DRUG PRICES CONTINUE TO ADVANCE AT THIS\nDEGREE? >> YEAH, I THINK MYLAN'S GOING\nTO HAVE TO BACK DOWN BECAUSE WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS IN FACT\nOUTRAGEOUS. AND UNJUSTIFIABLE.\nAND HAS NO RELATIONSHIP TO ANY OF THEIR EXPENSES.\nTHEY'VE OVERSTEPPED. THEIR GREED IS JUST TOO MUCH.\nBUT YOU'RE ALSO RIGHT THAT THIS IS A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM.\nMYLAN IS NOT AN OUTLIER. WE'VE SEEN MORE THAN HALF OF THE\nDRUGS OVER THE LAST YEAR HAVE 10% YEAR OVER YEAR PRICE SPIKES.\nBOTH ON PATENT AND OFF PATENT PRODUCTS.\nWE DO NEED MUCH FASTER COMPETITION.\nALTHOUGH THE BIG PROBLEM WITH COMPETITION IS NOT REGULATORY\nBARRIERS. THE BIG PROBLEM ARE PATENT OR\nOTHER MONOPOLY BARRIERS THAT THE DRUG COMPANIES HAVE WON THROUGH\nTHIS CONGRESS. >> BUT NOT IN THIS CASE.\n>> NO, NOT IN THIS CASE. THIS IS AN UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCE.\nAND THEY DO HAVE AN EFFECTIVE MONOPOLY WHICH THEY'VE BUILT UP\nIN PART THROUGH A LOT OF WORK ON DEVELOPING THE BRAND.\nBUT AS A MONOPOLIST THEY HAVE SOME DUTY, JUST MORAL OBLIGATION\nWITH A LIFE SAVING PRODUCT, TO KEEP THEIR PRODUCT REASONABLY\nPRICED. >> ARE YOU SAYING, ROBERT -- BY\nTHE WAY, THEY HAVE ABOUT AN 85% MARKET SHARE.\nAVIQ PULLED OFF THE MARKET AND THERE ARE SOME OTHER MINOR\nPLAYERS OUT THERE. WOULD YOU SUGGEST THE FTC GET\nINVOLVED, ROBERT? >> IT'S NOT CLEAR IF THERE'S\nREALLY AN FTC VIOLATION ON THIS. I MEAN,",

SO HOPEFULLY LABOR DAY THERE'S\nSOME DISCUSSION GOING ON HERE ABOUT DOING THE RIGHT THING.\n>> BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY I DON'T THINK THE FDA'S GOING TO\nHOLD THE BAG ON THIS. THE COMPANY IS AND THE COMPANY'S\nEXECUTIVES AND MANAGERS AND LEADERS.\nTHEY'RE THE ONES WHO WILL HAVE TO EITHER FIX THIS OR THERE WILL\nBE BLOOD ON THE FLOOR. >> HE'S HIGHLIGHTING WHAT SHOULD\nBE. YOU'RE HIGHLIGHTING WHAT IS\nLIKELY TO BE. >> I JUST THINK THAT THE PEOPLE\nWHO ARE GOING TO LOOK BAD AND THE COMPANY THAT'S GOING TO\nTAKE -- IT'S GOING TO BE MYLAN. >> BUT AGAIN, TO BE NOT\nDEFENDING THE PRICE INCREASE FROM MYLAN, BUT WE BROUGHT IT UP\nYESTERDAY. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE\nTHAT MANY OF THE TOP DRUGS HAVE SEEN PRICES INCREASE THIS YEAR.\nSOME MORE THAN DOUBLING. IN FACT, FOUR OF THE TOP TEN\nDRUGS HAVE SEEN MASSIVE PRICE INCREASES OVER THE PAST 12\nMONTHS. IN FACT, THERE WAS A \"NEW YORK\nTIMES\" ARTICLE ON APRIL 26th, I THINK IT WAS, DESPITE PRICE\nINCREASES THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY HASN'T LEARNED ITS\nLESSON, SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT, PETER.\nTHE IDEA BEING IT'S NOT JUST MYLAN, IT'S EVERYBODY.\nWHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? >> YOU HAVE TWO SEPARATE SILOS\nHERE. ON THE GENERIC DRUG SIDE YOU\nHAVE PEOPLE THAT HAVE MONOPOLIES ON PRODUCTS NEEDED BY A LOT OF\nPEOPLE AND THE FDA CAN CERTAINLY HELP.\nON THE INNOVATIVE DRUG SIDE YOU HAVE COMPANIES RAISING THE PRICE\nBECAUSE THEY'RE BEING FORCED BY PBNs AND INSURANCE COMPANIES TO\nGIVE THEM DEEPER AND DEEPER DISCOUNTS.\n>> WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGER, THE\nPBM, THE NAMES NONE OF OUR VIEWERS PROBABLY EVER TALK ABOUT\nTHAT ARE IN BETWEEN THE PHARMACY AND THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY,\nTHEIR PROFITS AND REVENUES HAVE ALSO BEEN GOING UP DRAMATICALLY\nTHE LAST FEW YEARS. BUT THEY GET NO ATTENTION.\n>> SURE, WHEN PEOPLE SAY DRUG PRICES ARE TOO HIGH, THAT'S THE\nSOUND BITE, RIGHT? WHAT PEOPLE REALLY MEAN IS THEIR\nCO-PAY AT THE PHARMACY IS TOO HIGH.\nAND THAT'S NOT A FACTOR OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY BECAUSE\nTHEY'RE GIVING 20%, 40%, 70% DISCOUNTS TO THE PBNs, INSURANCE\nCOMPANIES WHO ARE NOT PASSING ALONG THE SAVINGS TO THE\nCONSUMERS WHICH GOES BACK TO OBAMACARE, THE ACA, WHERE PEOPLE\nREALIZE HAVING HEALTH INSURANCE AND HAVING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE\nARE TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS.\nSO IT'S THIS WHOLE ECOSYSTEM OF PEOPLE PLAYING NICER IN THE SAND\nBOX. >> THAT WAS REALLY NICELY SUMMED\nUP. I WANT TO ASK YOU THOUGH, HOW\nDOES THE FDA SOLVE THIS PROBLEM OF THE GENERIC BACKLOG WE'RE\nSEEING? WHY WHEN THEY REJECT THE TEVA\nAPPLICATION DO WE JUST SEE CERTAIN DEFICIENCIES CITED AND\nDON'T KNOW ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT WHY IT WAS REJECTED OR HOW\nTHEY'RE WORKING TOGETHER TO FIX THE PROBLEM?\n>> FIRSTLY THE INFORMATION IN THAT FILE IS CONFIDENTIAL TO\nTEVA, IF THEY WANTED TO SHARE IT, THEY COULD.\nI WANT TO KNOW AT THE FDA THIS SHOULD BE PRIORITY, WE SHOULD\nWORK WITH THIS COMPANY TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN, WHERE'S UPPER\nMANAGEMENT, ADULTS SAYING CAREFUL ATTENTION, ATTENTION\nMUST BE PAID, WE HAVE TO AVOID SHORTAGES AND MAKE SURE\nCOMPETITION EXISTS, WHICH IS THE CONCEPT BEHIND -- RELATIVE TO\nDRUG ANYWAY. THAT'S THE FDA'S ROLE IN HELPING\nPRICE, VALUE AND QUALITY. IT'S A TRIAD.\nTHEY GET TO MARKET WITH A DEGREE OF SPEED THAT IMPACTS PEOPLE'S\nPOCKETBOOKS. >> YOU'RE DESCRIING SOMETHING\nTHAT ONLY HAPPENS IN A NONBUREAUCRATIC SITUATION THAT'S\nNOT THE GOVERNMENT. THE DAY THIS GETS DEALT WITH IS\nTHE DAY A VERY UNFORTUNATE CHILD OR FAMILY MEMBER DIES BECAUSE\nTHEY DIDN'T BUY THE EPIPEN BECAUSE IT WAS TOO EXPENSIVE AND\nTHEN IT BLOWS UP AND THEN THE GOVERNMENT DOES SOMETHING ABOUT\nIT. >> AND THAT'S WHY THE POLITICAL\nATTENTION'S SO IMPORTANT. THERE WILL BE HEARINGS IN THE\nSENATE. THINGS WILL HAPPEN.\n>> SPEAKING OF POLITICS, I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU WERE TRYING TO\nRAISE WITH THE FACT THE CEO OF THIS COMPANY IS A DAUGHTER OF A\nSENATOR, BUT WHEN I LOOK BACK AT THE HISTORY OF THIS COMPANY, YOU\nCAN READ THAT THEY WERE VERY, VERY GOOD AT MARKETING.\nTHEY WERE VERY GOOD AT BUILDING -- IT READS TO ME THAT\nTHEY WERE VERY GOOD AT REGULATORY CAPTURE.\nTHIS IS WHAT ECONOMISTS USE TO SAY YOU LOBBY AND YOU LOBBY AND\nLOBBY THE GOVERNMENT. SUDDENLY THE EPIPEN FOR YEARS IT\nWAS AROUND, BUT NOW IT'S REQUIRED TO BE AT SCHOOL.\nYOU'RE REQUIRED BEFORE YOU CAN GO TO CAMP.\nYOU MUST BUY IT. IT HAS BEEN LEGISLATED INTO\nPROFITABILITY. I BET DUE TO THE SUCCESS OF A\nLOBBYING OF THE COMPANY. >> AND THE FACT THAT IT'S\nACTUALLY A REALLY TERRIFIC PRODUCT.\nBUT I'M NOT -- BUT RELATIVE -- >> BUT IT WAS A TERRIFIC PRODUCT\nLONG BEFORE MYLAN TOOK IT OVER, RIGHT?\n>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. THEY KNEW WHAT TO DO.\nTHEY KNEW HOW TO GET IT OUT IN FRONT.\nMY POINT ABOUT HEATHER'S DAD BEING A U.S. SENATOR IS SHE\nSHOULD NO BETTER. IN AN ELECTION CYCLE NO LESS TO\nDO SOMETHING LIKE THIS EXPECTING SOMETHING NOT TO HAPPEN IS JUST\nNAIVE. >> ALL VERY INTERESTING.\n>> YEAH. >> PETER, GREAT TO HAVE YOU ON.\nTHANKS SO MUCH FOR WEIGHING IN. >> THANKS SO MUCH.\n>> AND SUZY IS STICKING WITH US THROUGH THE SHOW.\nALL RIGHT.

TODAY, 34 BILLION FIVE-YEAR\nNOTES YIELD AT AUCTION 1.125. PRETTY MUCH SPOT-ON WITH THE\nWHEN ISSUED MARKET.

              "text": "TO DREELIVER AN ADDRESS ON MOND.\n>>> HILLARY CLINTON ALSO MAKING HEADLINES THIS MORNING, ALSO IN\nHER INTERVIEW WITH ANDERSON COOPER, RESPONDING TO A WHOLE\nLOT MORE. THIS IS HER FIRST NATIONAL\nINTERVIEW IN ABOUT A MONTH. SHE TOOK ON A NUMBER OF TOPICS,\nINCLUDING THE E-MAIL SAGA THAT HAS BEEN DOGGING HER CAMPAIGN.\n>> ACCORDING TO \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" REPORT, YOU TOLD FBI\nINVESTIGATORS THAT FORMER SECRETARY SECRETARY OF STATE\nADVISED YOU TO USE A PERSONAL E-MAIL ACCOUNT.\nHIS REPORT WAS, QUOTE, HER PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO PIN IT ON\nME AND THAT THE QUOTE, THE TRUTH IS, SHE WAS USING FOR A YEAR\nBEFORE I SENT HER A MEMO OWE TELLING HER WHAT I DID.\nHE IS TALKING ABOUT THE PRIVATE E-MAIL ACCOUNT.\nDID YOU SAY THAT TO FBI INVESTIGATORS, AND IS SECRETARY\nPOWELL? WERE YOU USING THE SERVER PRIOR\nTO YOUR CONVERSATION WITH HIM? >> WELL, LOOK, I HAVE THE UTMOST\nRESPECT FOR SECRETARY POWELL, AND HE WAS INCREDIBLY GRACIOUS\nAND HELPFUL AFTER I WAS NOMINATED AND BEFORE I TOOK THE\nJOB. I APPRECIATED THE TIME HE TOOK\nWHEN I WAS PREPARING TO BECOME SECRETARY, AND I VALUED HIS\nADVICE. I'M NOT GOING TO RE-LITIGATE IN\nPUBLIC MY PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM.\nI'VE BEEN ASKED MANY, MANY QUESTIONS IN THE PAST YEAR ABOUT\nE-MAILS, AND WHAT I'VE LEARNED IS THAT WHEN I TRY TO EXPLAIN\nWHAT HAPPENED, IT CAN SOUND LIKE I'M TRYING TO EXCUSE WHAT I DID.\nAND THERE ARE NO EXCUSES. I WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT THE\nDECISION TO HAVE A SINGLE E-MAIL ACCOUNT WAS MINE.\nI TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT. I'VE APOLOGIZED FOR IT.\nI WOULD CERTAINLY DO DIFFERENTLY IF I COULD.\nBUT OBVIOUSLY I'M GRATEFUL THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT CONCLUDED\nTHERE WAS NO BASIS TO PURSUE THIS MATTER FURTHER, AND I\nBELIEVE THE PUBLIC AND IS CONSIDERING MY FULL RECORD, AND\nEXPERIENCE AS THEY CONSIDER THEIR CHOICE FOR PRESIDENT.\n>> DONALD TRUMP IS INDICATING HE WOULD ALLOW SOME ILLEGAL\nIMMIGRANTS TO REMAIN IN THE COUNTRY.\nEARLY ON DURING THE PRIMARIES, AS YOU KNOW, HE TALKED ABOUT 11\nMILLION UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS HAVE TO GET OUT.\nTHE GOOD ONES CAN COME BACK IN. HE HAS TOLD FOX NEWS HE WOULD\nWORK WITH PEOPLE IF THEY PAID BACK TOAXES.\nWHAT DO YOU MAKE WHAT, APPEARS TO BE A BIG SHIFT, IF THIS IS IN\nFACT HIS POLICY MOVING FORWARD? >> WELL, YOU KNOW, MY\nUNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE COMMENT YOU JUST REFERRED TO WAS\nTHE THIRD DIFFERENT POSITION HE TOOK ON IMMIGRATION YESTERDAY.\nSOMEBODY HAS TOLD HIM, I GUESS THE LATEST PEOPLE THAT HE IS\nCONSULTING, HOW DAMAGING HIS STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN.\nHOW TERRIBLE HIS DEPORTATION PLAN IS.\nHOW OFFENSIVE HIS VIEWS ON IMMIGRANTS HAS BEEN.\nSO HE IS TRYING TO DO, YOU KNOW, KIND OF A SHUFFLE HERE, BUT I\nTHINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE ENTIRE CONTEXT.\nWE NEED TO BELIEVE HIM WHEN HE BULLIES AND THREATENS TO THROW\nOUT EVERY IMMIGRANT IN THE COUNTRY, AND CERTAINLY WHEN HE\nCHANGES HIS POSITION THREE TIMES IN ONE DAY, IT SENDS A MESSAGE\nTHAT IT IS JUST A DESPERATE EFFORT TO TRY TO LAND SOMEWHERE\nTHAT ISN'T AS, YOU KNOW, DEVASTATING TO HIS CAMPAIGN, AS\nHIS COMMENTS AND HIS POSITIONS HAVE BEEN UP UNTIL NOW.\n>> ALL RIGHT, THAT'S HILLARY CLINTON.\nLET'S NOW HEAR FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS CAMPAIGN.\nDONALD TRUMP'S SIDE. DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER,\nKELLYANNE CONWAY JOINS US. SO LET'S START WITH YOU\nPERSONALLY. YOU HAD TO MAKE A TOUGH CHOICE\nHERE. WE SEE IT SOMETIMES IN POLITICS.\nNOT AT THIS LEVEL, THOUGH. YOU WERE WITH TED CRUZ.\nYOU HAD TO SHIFT OVER AND START WORKING FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nHOW MUCH OF A PROBLEM WAS IT FOR YOU PERSONALLY?\nBECAUSE YOU HAD BEEN TOUGH ON TRUMP.\nYOU HAD CALLED HIM OUT FOR A LOT OF THINGS THAT HIS CRITICS CALL\nHIM OUT FOR. NOW YOU'RE WORKING FOR HIM.\nWHY WAS THE SHIFT OKAY IN YOUR OPINION?\n>> I'VE KNOWN DONALD TRUMP FOR A LONG TIME.\nI RESPECT HIS BUSINESS RECORD. I RESPECT THE FACT THAT EVEN\nBEFORE HE PROMOTED ME TO THIS POSITION, HE HAS BEEN PROMOTING\nAND ADVANCING WOMEN IN THE TRUMP CORPORATION FOR DECADES.\nPEOPLE OF COLOR, PEOPLE FROM VERY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES ACROSS\nTHE WORLD. BOTH GENDERS OBVIOUSLY.\nALL WALKS OF LIFE. THAT'S VERY COMPELLING TO ME,\nBECAUSE I LIKE TO ASSESS PEOPLE BY WHAT THEY DO, NOT BY WHAT\nTHEY SAY. PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN\nPOLITICS, WHEN EVERYBODY HAS A LOT TO SAY, AND THEY'RE NEVER\nREALLY HELD ACCOUNTABLE. SO I RESPECT SENATOR CRUZ AND A\nLOT OF HIS LEADERSHIP, AND WAS HAPPY TO RUN ONE OF THE SUPER\nPACS AFFILIATED WITH HIM, BUT IT WAS A GOOD TRANSITION FOR ME,\nBECAUSE I'M SUPPORTING THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR\nPRESIDENT. I THINK HILLARY CLINTON'S\nPOLICIES WOULD NOT BE GOOD FOR THIS COUNTRY.\nI'M RESPECTFUL OF WHAT DONALD TRUMP HAS BUILT.\nUSUALLY POLITICIANS LIKE HILLARY CLINTON, THEY ERECT CAMPAIGNS.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS BUILT A MOVEMENT.\nPEOPLE FEEL THEY'RE PART OF THAT MOVEMENT.\nYOU SEE PEOPLE STANDING IN THE RAIN SOMETIMES FOR THREE HOURS,\nJUST TO SAY I WAS THERE WHEN HE WAS THERE.\nAND I WENT TO LISTEN TO HIM. I ACTUALLY THINK PEOPLE HAVE WAY\nTOO DISMISSIVE OF WHAT THIS HAS MEANT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, IN\nOTHER WORDS, THOSE WHO WANT TO ATTACK DONALD TRUMP SHOULD BE\nSTUDYING HIS VOTERS AND WHAT MOTIVATES THEM AND AS A\nPOLLSTER, I HAVE COURSE TRAFFIC IN CONSUMERS AND VOTERS AND WHAT\nMOTIVATES THEM AND ANIMATES THEM, AND I LIKE RUDY GIULIANI,\nWHEN HE IS OUT, HE HAS NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT.\n>> THAT'S TRUE. WE'RE LIVING THROUGH A UNIQUE\nPERIOD IN OUR POLITICS. WE ASK EVERYBODY WHO WINDS UP AT\nTHE TOP OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. WHEN YOU WERE RUNNING AGAINST\nHIM, HEY I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIS TAXES, TRANSPARENCY, THAT'S\nFINE. LET US SEE HIS TAXES.\nDO YOU THINK YOU CAN MOVE HIM ON HIS POSITION.\nWE GET A BLANKET NO. >> I CONFER WITH THE LAWYERS AND\nTHE ACCOUNTANTS WHO HAVE GIVEN HIM THE ADVICE TO NOT RELEASE\nHIS TAXES. I HAVE TO DEFER TO THAT\nAUTHORITY. I'M A FULL RECOVERED ATTORNEY.\nI'M NOT AN TANT ACCOUNTANT. I UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR CONCERNS\nARE. I THINK THE QUESTION VOTERS HAVE\nTO ASK THEMSELVES WHAT, WILL MY TAX BE UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP,\nPRESIDENT CLINTON. HE WENT OUT ABOUT TEN DAYS AGO\nNOW AND GAVE A SPEECH ON MIDDLE CLASS TAX REFORM.\nYOU CAN LOOK AT IT. YOU CAN SEE WHAT WOULD BE HIS\nINVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE. I THINK PEOPLE CAN --\n>> I GET THAT, YEAH, I DON'T KNOW HOW STRONG A LEGAL CASE IS\nFOR WHY HE DOESN'T HAVE TO PUT IT UP, BUT THAT'S UP TO HIM AND\nHIS ATTORNEY. HE COULD PUT OUT HIS RATE AND\nWHAT HE GAVE. THESE FLASH POINTS FOR PEOPLE\nAND STILL SAFE, DO YOU THINK WOULD HE DO THAT?\n>> I'M NOT SURE. I WOULD HAVE TO ASK THEM.\nIF HE NEVER SAYS ANOTHER WORD, LITERALLY, HE WILL HAVE SAID A\nMILLION MORE THINGS ABOUT A MILLION MORE ISSUES THAN HILLARY\nCLINTON, HIS OPPONENT. I'M JUST AMAZED THAT SOMEBODY\nWHO HAS BEEN IN PUBLIC LIFE AND POLITICAL LIFE FOR DECADES IS SO\nTHIN WITH HER RECORD. IS SO -- IS TELLING ANDERSON\nCOOPER LAST NIGHT, WELL, PEOPLE CAN LOOK AT MY RECORD.\nHOW, SHE DOESN'T DO WHAT HE DOES.\nIN THE LAST WEEK, THIS MAN HAS GONE OUT AND TALKED TO\nCOMMUNITIES OF COLOR ABOUT ISSUE.\nHE HAS TALKED ABOUT LAW ENFORCE. HOW TO DEFEAT RADICAL ISLAMIC\nTERRORISM, REFORMING THE TAX SYSTEM AND MAKE EVERYDAY\nAFFORDABLE FOR AMERICANS, WHO FEEL IT IS NOT SO.\nHE HAS TALKED ABOUT IMMIGRATION. SO THESE VOTERS HAVE WHAT THEY\nDESERVE AND THEY EXPECT FROM HIM AS A CANDIDATE, WHICH IS HE IS\nACTUALLY TAKING THE CASE TO THE PEOPLE.\nHILLARY CLINTON IS GOING TO GIVE A SPEECH TODAY ABOUT HIM AND HIS\nCAMPAIGN. AT LEAST I'M PROUD THAT OUR\nCAMPAIGN IS TALKING TO PEOPLE ABOUT THE ISSUES THEY TELL CNN\nAND OTHER POLLSTERS THEY WANT DISCUSSED.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT THE CAMPAIGN IS SAYING ON\nIMMIGRATION. I SEE THE CONWAY EFFECT.\nTHERE IS A SHIFT IN HIS TALK ABOUT IMMIGRATION, NO MORE ROUND\nTHEM ALL UP, I'M GOING TO PUT OUT AN AGENCY TO FIND THEM, THE\nWAY HE WAS BASHING TED CRUZ, BASHING JEB BUSH AND MARCO RUBIO\nFOR THEIR POSITIONS, WHICH SOUND A LOT LIKE WHAT HE WAS SAYING\nLAST NIGHT. WHY IS HE CHANGING HIS POSITION,\nAND WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO ACHIEVE?\n>> DONALD TRUMP IS AGAINST AMNESTY AND I'M AGAINST IT.\n>> STEVE KING, WHO WE BOTH KNOW WELL, WOULD CALL WHAT HE SAID\nLAST NIGHT AMNESTY. WORKING ONE DOCUMENTED PEOPLE IN\nANY WAY WOULD BE CONSIDERED AMNESTY.\nTHAT'S WHAT TRUMP WAS SAYING ALL ALONG.\nNOW HE IS SAYING SOMETHING DIFFERENT.\n>> LET ME TELL YOU WHAT HIS PLAN IS, BECAUSE THIS HELPS THE\nVOTERS UNDERSTAND WHERE DONALD TRUMP IS ON IMMIGRATION.\nIT IS THIS WEEK WHAT IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN.\nNO AMNESTY. NO SANCTUARY CITIES SO INNOCENT\nVICTIMS LIKE KATE STEINLE WHO WAS MURDERED IN FRONT OF HER\nFATHER, BY A MAN WHO HAD BEEN DEPORTED FIVE TIMES.\nHILLARY CLINTON IS FOR SANCTUARY CITIES, SHE IS FOR CATCH AND\nRELEASE, OPEN BORDERS. SHE IS TO THE LEFT OF PRESIDENT\nOBAMA ON THE ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION.\nTHE ONLY WAY THE VOTERS WILL KNOW THAT IS IF WE TELL THEM\nBECAUSE SHE WON'T. SHE IS HIDING FROM THAT.\nNO AMNESTY FROM HIM. NO OPEN BORDERS.\nSECURE THE BORDER, BUILD THE WALL.\nNO SANCTUARY CITIES. GET THE BUSINESSES TO HAVE\nE-VERIFY. YOU CAN'T LOOK AT SOMEBODY'S\nDOCUMENT AND LOOK THE OTHER WAY. >> THAT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN WHAT\nCRUZ, RUBIO DID. >> NO, IT IS DIFFERENT.\nRUBIO'S PLAN IS -- THIS MAN IS NOT FOR AMNESTY.\n>> NEITHER IS RUBIO. >> WELL --\n>> WHAT THEY SAID IS WORK WITH THEM.\nYOU CAN'T DEPORT EVERYBODY. YOU CAN'T BREAK UP THE FAMILIES.\nDONALD TRUMP SAID THAT LAST NIGHT.\n>> SENATOR RUBIO IS A DIFFERENT CASE.\nHE LED THE GANG OF EIGHT WITH CHUCK SCHUMER AND I THINK DICK\nDURBIN. THE GANG OF EIGHT, THEIR PLAN\nWAS AMNESTY. THEIR PLAN WAS AND IS IF, THEY\nHAD THEIR WAY AND I THINK IT HURT HIM TO TRY TO WORK WITH\nTHESE DEMOCRATS WHO WANT OPEN BORDERS AND IT HURT HIM.\nWHAT VOTERS NEED TO SEE IS WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS SAYING HIS\nIMMIGRATION PLAN IS. LET ME MAKE CLEAR, BECAUSE\nSENATOR SESSIONS HAS BEEN TRAVELING WITH MR. TRUMP, STEVEN\nMILLER, THESE ARE IMMIGRATION EXPERTS.\nI'VE BEEN HERE ALL WEEK. I THINK THEY ARE TRYING TO FIND\nA WAY TO EXPLAIN, WELL, FOR DONALD TRUMP TO ARTICULATE TO\nAMERICANS A COMPLEX ISSUE AND HOW HE FEELS ABOUT IT.\nI ASSURE YOU, NOTHING HAS CHANGED IN TERMS OF THE\nPOLICIES. I ALSO THINK THAT WE SHOULD ALL\nGIVE HIM CREDIT WHEN IT COMES TO 11 OR 12 MILLION, A, YOU ENFORCE\nTHE LAWS. YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE, CHRIS, HOW\nMUCH WOULD CHANGE QUICKLY IF YOU ACTUALLY ENFORCE THE LAWS THAT\nARE NOT BEING ENFORCED. NUMBER TWO, HE WANTS TO FIND A\nQUOTE, THESE ARE HIS WORDS, FAIR AND HUMANE WAY OF DEALING WITH\nTHEM, AND QUOTE, HE DOESN'T WANT TO CAUSE PEOPLE HARM.\nTHAT'S LEADERSHIP. THAT'S PRESIDENTIAL.\n>> IT'S ALSO NEW FOR HIM, WHICH IS WHY PEOPLE ARE POINTING OUT\nTHE CONTRAST. SOMETHING ELSE, HE CAME OUT OF\nTHE BOX, I THINK READING OFF THE TELEPROMPTER, AND CALLED HILLARY\nCLINTON A BIGOT. DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE HILLARY\nCLINTON IS A BIGOT? DOES DONALD TRUMP BELIEVE THAT?\nWHY DID YOU HAVE HIM SAY IT? >> FIRST OF ALL, HE USES HIS OWN\nWORDS, AND HAVE YOU SEEN WHAT HE HAS CALLED, HAVE YOU HEARD WHAT\nHE IS CALLED INCLUDING HERE ON CNN.\nWE HAVE BECOME SO INNURED. >> WHEN PEOPLE CALL HIM A BIGOT,\nI SAY WHY DO YOU CALL HIM THAT? >> I'VE NEVER HEARD A GOOD\nANSWER YET. I'VE NEVER HEARD A NONPARTISAN.\n>> THEY SHOULDN'T CALL HIM THAT BUT THAT DOESN'T ERASE WHAT HE\nSAYS. >> HE SAID --\n>> HE CALLED HER A BIGOT. >> WHEN IT'S OKAY TO DO IS TO\nSHOW HOW REPRESS SIEIVE. >> MAKE THE POLICY.\n>> FOR A LONG TIME, HE WAS CRITICIZED FOR NOT SPEAKING TO\nPEOPLE OF COLOR. THE MOMENT HE DID IT, I DON'T\nLIKE THE WORDS YOU USED. >> HE IS SPEAKING ABOUT THEM,\nNOT TO THEM. HE HASN'T GONE THERE YET.\n>> HE WILL. AND WHEN I LEAVE HERE TOWDAY,\nWE'RE HAVING A MEETING WITH AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND HISPANIC\nLEADERS. WAS AT THE HISPANIC ROUND TABLE\nWHEN MR. TRUMP MET WITH THEM HERE IN NEW YORK.\nWE HAD A VERY PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION.\nSO MUCH HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT WITH IMMIGRATION, IT WAS\nPROBABLY 15% OF THE COULDEN SAYINGS.\nI WAS SITTING RIGHT THERE, CHRIS.\nTHEY TALKED ABOUT ACCESS TO CAPITAL FOR EXPANSION.\nTHE HISPANIC LEADERS TOLD MR. TRUMP, REMINDED HIM HOW\nIMPORTANT HOME OWNERSHIP IS TO THE COMMUNITY AND A LOW DEFAULT\nRATE HISPANICS HAVE WITH THOSE HOME LOANS.\n>> NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. >> IT IS PART OF THE AMERICAN\nDREAM. THE MULTI GENERATIONAL FAMILIES,\nMANY OF THEM ARE RELIGIOUS, EVANGELICAL AND CATHOLIC.\nSO MANY OF THEM COME FROM COUNTRIES WHERE RELIGIOUS\nLIBERTY WAS NOT APPRECIATED AND PRACTICED AND PROTECT .\n>> WHY DOESN'T HE TALK ABOUT THOSE.\n>> WHEN SHE GIVES HER SPEECH TODAY.\nCALL ME LATER AND LET'S TALLY UP AND SEE WHAT SHE CALLS HIM.\nWHAT CNN QUALIFIES AS BREAKING NEWS.\nCLINTON, QUOTE, TRUMP IS A RACIST AND PEDALS IN HATE.\nWHY IN THE WORLD ISN'T TAKING THE WOMAN TO TELL US WHAT SHE\nWOULD DO ABOUT OBAMA -- >> DOES THAT MAKE CALLING HER\nTHE SAME THING OKAY? LOOK, I GET POLITICS.\nYOU TAKE THE SHOTS YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH.\nI'M SAYING I THOUGHT THE SHIFT ON HIM WAS GOING TO BE HE IS\nGOING TO TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT\nMATTER, HE IS GOING TO BANG POLICY BECAUSE HE IS BETTER AT\nMAKING THINGS HAPPEN BECAUSE OF HIS BUSINESS ACUMEN AND LEAVE\nTHE HOT TALK TO THE SIDE. THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING, BECAUSE\nHE DIDN'T. >> HE HAS GOT -- LISTEN, HE\nGIVES SEVERAL SPEECHES IN A WEEK.\nRALLY, POLICIES. THAN SHE HAS DONE IN THE ENTIRE\nCAMPAIGN. IF WE'RE GOING TO PICK ON ONE\nWORD AND NOT THE TOTALITY OF WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT AND\nSMOKE HER OUT, WHERE IN THE WORLD ARE YOUR POLICIES, YOUR\nSPEECHES, SECRETARY CLINTON, ON THE NEXT CHAPTERS OF OBAMA CARE,\nON TAKING THESE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY?\nARE WE BLIND, CHRIS? DO WE NOT SEE OUR FELLOW\nAMERICANS IN NEED. I HAVE TO GIVE DONALD TRUMP\nENORMOUS CREDIT IN THIS WAY. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEES\nHAVE NOT. HAVE NOT DONE ENOUGH TO REACH\nOUT TO COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. HAVE NOT DONE ENOUGH TO GO AND\nLITERALLY HEAR FROM THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES, AND WE PLAN TO DO\nTHAT. KEEP YOUR EYE ON IT.\nTAKE OUR CASE RIGHT TO THE PEOPLE.\nI SEE THE NEW NBC POLL WHERE HE IS 8%.\nI'M GLAD IT IS ABOVE MITT ROMNEY'S.\nBUT I WANT IT TO BE 20%, 30%. >> THAT WOULD BE A GAME CHANGER\nFOR THE PARTY. >> WE NEED TO EARN THOSE VOTES.\nEARNING THEIR TRUST AND LENDING AN EAR.\nHEARING THEIR KERCONCERNS. I HAVE TO TELL YOU AS AN\nAMERICAN, I DON'T LIKE THE FAILING, CRUMBLING SCHOOLS IN\nSOME OF OUR COMMUNITIES. I DON'T LIKE THE FACT THAT WE\nHAVE MILLIONS MORE IN POVERTY. WE CANNOT ABIDE THAT AMERICANS\nDON'T HAVE HEALTH CARE, EVEN AFTER OBAMA CARE.\nWHERE ARE YOU ON THESE ISSUES. WE'RE TAKING OUR CASE TO THE\nVOTERS, AND SHE IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT A WEBSITE TODAY.\nSHE IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP.\nI'M GLAD WE'RE BACK IN HER HEAD. THAT WAS GOAL NUMBER ONE.\nHER SPOKESMAN, BRIAN FALLON SAID IF YOU DON'T LIKE HER, DON'T\nVOTE FOR HER. WOW, HE JUST BASICALLY TOLD THE\nMAJORITY OF AMERICANS THAT SAY THEY DON'T LIKE HER AND THEY\nDON'T TRUST HER THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO VOTE FOR HER.\nHE DID MY JOB BY 8:00 THIS MORNING.\nI THINK THEY'RE FLIP-FLOPPING A LITTLE BIT.\nSORT OF FIGURING OUT AND MADE A HUGE MISTAKE TWO, THREE WEEKS\nAGO, WHEN OUR CAMPAIGN WAS NOT DOING AS WELL AS IT IS NOW, THEY\nMADE A HUGE MISTAKE BY NOT GIVING POLICY SPEECHES, NOT\nVISITING THE TROOPS ABROAD AND SHE COULD HAVE PUT HIM AWAY AND\nFAILED TO DO IT. >> KELLYANNE CONWAY, GREAT TO\nHAVE YOU ON \"NEW DAY,\" AS ALWAYS.\n>> THANK YOU, CHRIS AND",

I THINK THE PEOPLE AROUND HIM\nARE SOFTENING. I THINK ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL\nHE'S EVEN HEARING IT. I THINK HE LOOKS AT IT FROM A\nREALISTIC STANDPOINT AND SOME OF THE THINGS HE THOUGHT ABOUT\nDOING AREN'T PLAUSIBLE BUT YOU TAKE THE MOST IMPORTANT NUGGETS\nAND MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT.

HE'S NOT BEEN OUT THERE SAYING\nTHAT. >> HE SAID WE'RE GOING TO WORK\nWITH THEM, THEY HAVE TO PAY TAXES.\nTHAT'S WHAT CITIZENS DO. >> WHAT HE HAS BEEN SAYING AND\nTHIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT, HE'S BUILDING A WALL, MEXICO IS\nPAYING FOR IT IT'S IN STARK CONTRAST TO HILLARY CLINTON OPEN\nBORDER AMNESTY AND IN CONTRAST TO BARACK OBAMA WHO LAST YEAR\nALONE LET OUT 19,700 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WITH CRIMINAL\nCONVICTIONS INTO SOCIETY, 200 OF WHICH WERE MURDER CONVICTIONS.\nDONALD TRUMP WANTS TO DEPORT THOSE FOLKS.\nHE'S LISTENED TO VOTERS. VOTERS HAVE SAID TO HIM WE DON'T\nLIKE THE PART ABOUT BREAKING UP FAMILIES, WE WANT THOSE PEOPLE\nTO BE ABLE TO STAY. HE MOVED ON IT.\nHE SOFTENED AND I LIKE THAT. I LIKE BEING RESPONSIVE TO THE\nPEOPLE, TO YOUR VOTERS. >> HE EVEN USED OPERATION\nWETBACK, WHICH IS AN EXAMPLE OF A TERM HE SAID HE WANTED TO\nREPLICATE IT. MANY SAW THE TERM AND THE POLICY\nAS RACIST. SO THIS NEW LANGUAGE, THOUGH,\nTHAT'S NOT THE DEFINITION OF A FLIP-FLOP?\n>> NO, I THINK A FLIP-FLOP IS WHEN YOU FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE A\nDEEP SEATED PRINCIPLE. HILLARY CLINTON WAS FOR FREE\nTRADE AND NOW SHE'S AGAINST TPP AND NAFTA AND SHE'S SWITCHED ON\nA NUMBER OF THE SOCIAL ISSUES. WHETHER THAT'S GOOD OR BAD, WE\nCAN FIGHT ABOUT THE EFFICACY OF THAT.\nTHEY ARE MAJOR CATACLYSMIC FLIPS IN POLICY.\nHE STILL WANTS TO SECURE THIS COUNTRY, SECURE THE BORDER,\nUNLIKE HILLARY CLINTON, WHO WANTS TO RELEASE CRIMINAL ALIENS\nINTO SOCIETY. >> MARIA, DO YOU THINK THIS IS A\nFLIP FLOP? >> WELL, WE DON'T REALLY KNOW\nYET BECAUSE WE HAVE NO CLUE WHAT HIS IMMIGRATION POLICY IS.\nHE SEEMS TO SAY SOMETHING DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON WHO HE\nTALKS TO, BUT I WILL SAY THIS AND I'VE SAID THIS EVER SINCE\nWE'VE HEARD THERE'S POSSIBLY HIS QUOTE UNQUOTE SOFTENING OF HIS\nIMMIGRATION PLAN. IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK FOR\nLATINO VOTERS. WHEN YOU ANNOUNCE YOUR\nPRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, CALLING MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS RAPISTS AND\nCRIMINALS, THAT RIGHT NOW IS GOING TO SHUT YOU DOWN.\n>> HE DIDN'T. >> YES, HE DID.\nHE FOLLOWED THAT SAYING HE IS GOING TO DEPORT THEM ALL.\nHE'S GOING TO DO IT IN A HUMANE WAY, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT\nMEANS. >> KAYLEIGH IS SAYING THERE'S A\nDISTINCTION THAT MEXICO IS SENDING RAPIST AND MURDERERS.\nBUT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT MEXICO IS SENDING.\n>> NO, THERE ISN'T SO THAT WAS A HUGE BIGOTED RACIST INSULT TO\nALL IMMIGRANTS AND LATINOS HERE IN THIS COUNTRY.\nAND THAT IS HOW THEY TOOK IT. [ OVERLAPPING SPEAKERS ]\nKAYLEIGH, I'M NOT FINISHED. I DIDN'T INTERRUPT YOU.\nKAYLEIGH, I DID NOT INTERRUPT YOU.\nI DID NOT INTERRUPT YOU. SO WHEN HE FOLLOWS THAT UP WITH\nA DEPORTATION FORCE AND HE TALKS ABOUT REPLICATING A PROGRAM\nCALLED OPERATION WETBACK, WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT A MEXICAN\nAMERICAN JUDGE SAYING THAT HE CAN'T DO HIS JOB BECAUSE OF HIS\nMEXICAN HERITAGE, THOSE ARE RACIST, BIGOTED COMMENTS.\nSO LET'S BE CLEAR, THIS QUOTE UNQUOTE SOFTENING IS NOT AN\nAPPEAL TO LATINO VOTERS. IT IS AN APPEAL TO TRY TO GET\nTHE WHITE VOTERS TO BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE NOT AS RACIST AND BIGOTED\nAS WHAT THE LAST 429 DAYS HAVE MADE YOU SOUND LIKE.\n>> I THINK FOR THE PEOPLE UP HERE FOR THE SURROGATES ARE\nSAYING SOFTENING, BUT I THINK THE PEOPLE AT HOME, IT'S VERY\nINSULTING. THEY KNOW IT'S A CHANGE, IT'S A\nFLIP-FLOP. HE'S CHANGING HIS POLICY.\nTHIS IS A CHANGE IN HIS POLICY, BAKARI.\n>> I MEAN, IT IS A CHANGE IN HIS POLICY AND IT IS A FLIP-FLOP.\nI THINK ALL YOUR SURROGATES SO FAR, KAYLEIGH AND ANDRE AND\nMARIA HAVE POINTED OUT CLEARLY WHEN YOU START FROM A POSITION\nOPERATION WETBACK WHICH WAS VERY BRUTAL IN 1948 WHERE THEY WENT\nIN HOMES AND GATHERED PEOPLE UP IN A BRUTAL FASHION AND DEPORTED\nTHEM AND TOOK THEM BACK ACROSS THE BORDER.\nWHEN YOU TALK ABOUT PATTERNING YOUR IMMIGRATION POLICY AFTER\nTHAT, AND THEN TODAY YOU'RE SAYING THAT NO, WE'RE NOT GOING\nTO HAVE A DEPORTATION FORCE, WE'RE GOING TO KEEP FAMILIES\nTOGETHER, THAT IS A DEEP-SEEDED FLIP-FLOP BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE\nOF DEPORTATION. I THINK ANDRE LET HIS CANDIDATE\nOFF THE BACK BECAUSE ANDRE SAID PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE\nTHIS DISCUSSION ABOUT POLICY POINTS.\nDONALD TRUMP'S MAIN POINT, WHAT HE SOLD REPUBLICAN PRIMARY\nVOTERS WAS IMMIGRATION. REPUBLICAN PRIMARY VOTERS HAVE\nBEEN BAMBOOZLED. WE'VE BEEN SAYING FROM THE\nBEGINNING THAT IT'S POLITICALLY IMPRACTICAL, IT'S\nPOLITICALLY STUPID, IT FINANCIALLY IMPOSSIBLE AND YOU\nJUST SIMPLY CAN'T DO IT. NOW DONALD TRUMP HAS SOLD THIS\nBILL OF GOODS TO THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY VOTERS, THEY BOUGHT IT\nAND TODAY THEY'RE SAYING I'M SORRY, JEB BUSH, MARCO RUBIO AND\nJOHN KASICH ARE KICKING THEMSELVES SAYING I SHOULD HAVE\nTHOUGHT OF THAT. >> ANDRE, LET ME FIND THIS REAL\nQUICK. THIS IS JEB BUSH FROM THE\nPREVIOUS SEGMENT. HER NAME IS CHRISTI CAMPBELL.\nSHE ISSUED A STATEMENT SAYING IT IS UNSURPRISING THAT DONALD\nTRUMP IS FINALLY FACED WITH RECONCILING HIS IMMIGRATION\nPOLICY WITH REALITY. SOMETHING GOVERNOR BUSH\nPREDICTED LAST YEAR. GO AHEAD, ANDRE.\n>> I WAS GOING TO SAY, I SUPPORTED DONALD TRUMP IN THE\nPRIMARY, AND I DID NOT SUPPORT HIM BECAUSE OF HIS IMMIGRATION\nSTANCE. I SUPPORTED HIM BECAUSE I WANT\nHIM TO ABSOLUTELY CHANGE WASHINGTON.\nTO PUT IT IN A NOT NICE TERM, WASHINGTON NEEDS AN ENEMA.\nI'M FED UP WITH THE POLICY, THE DIRECTION THEY'VE TAKEN THIS\nCOUNTRY. HE WAS THE ONLY ONE WILLING TO\nTAKE ON THE ESTABLISHMENT. AND I DIDN'T LOVE EVERY SINGLE\nTHING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. I'M NOT ONE OF THESE SURROGATES\nWHO SAYS I LOVE EVERY SINGLE POLICY.\nI'M AN INDEPENDENT THINKER. >> TO THAT POINT, NOW HE'S\nCOMING BACK TO WHERE THOSE CANDIDATES WERE FROM THE\nBEGINNING. THAT IS NOT CONCERNING TO YOU\nTHAT HE IS BECOMING EVERYTHING HE SAID HE WASN'T GOING TO\nBECOME? >> I WATCHED AN INTERVIEW WITH\nRON PAUL. THE PERSON WHO INTERVIEWED HIM\nGAVE HIM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE.\nI LOVE THE FACT HE SAID I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT LIKE THAT.\nWHAT A GREAT PERSPECTIVE. I LIKE PEOPLE WHO RUN FOR OFFICE\nAND DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING EVERY SINGLE TIME AND ARE WILLING TO\nEVOLVE. >> VOTERS WERE INTERVIEWED AND\nARE YOU FRUSTRATED. DONALD TRUMP VOTERS THAT HE DID\nTHIS. NONE OF THE VOTERS ARE UPSET.\nYOU MISUNDERSTAND REPUBLICAN VOTERS WHEN YOU THINK\nWE'RE FOAMING AT THE MOUTH MEANING DEMOCRAT GENERALLY\nMISCHARACTERIZE THINKING WE'RE FOAMING AT THE MOUTH, WANTING TO\nDEPORT PEOPLE. THAT IS NOT TRUE.\nWE WANT A SECURE BORDER. WE WANT PEOPLE, IF THEY'RE GOOD,\nHARD WORKING PEOPLE TO BE HERE. BUT WE DON'T LIKE SOMEBODY LIKE\nKATE STEINLE GETTING KILLED BECAUSE THIS MAN WAS LEFT OUT ON\nTHE STREETS. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PARTS WHO\nHAVE LOST CHILDREN WHO STAND BY DONALD TRUMP AND SUPPORT HIM.\n>> LET BAKARI IN, MARIA. >> I JUST WANTED TO SAY.\nGO AHEAD. >> BAKARI SELLERS, GO.\n>> I THINK IT'S REALLY -- MY HEART GOES OUT TO KATE STEINLE\nAND HER FAMILY. ALL IMMIGRANTS WHO COME INTO\nTHIS COUNTRY ARE NOT RAPISTS, ARE NOT MURDERERS, MANY OF THEM\nDO THE DAILY TASK EVERY DAY TO HELP OUR LIVES BE SO MUCH\nBETTER. SO MY HEART DOES GO OUT TO KATE\nSTEINLE. THAT INDIVIDUAL SHOULD NOT HAVE\nBEEN IN THIS COUNTRY. TO ACTUALLY SAY BECAUSE OF A\nCONVERSATION DONALD TRUMP FOUND HUMANITY, ONE OF THE MOST\nDESPICABLE THINGS THAT DONALD TRUMP SAYS AND ONE OF THE MOST\nDESPICABLE THINGS THAT HIS SURROGATES SAY, THAT WE'RE GOING\nTO DO THIS HUMANELY. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A LITTER\nOF KITTENS. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT STRAY\nDOGS. WE'RE ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT\nHUMAN BEINGS. I'M GLAD THAT DONALD TRUMP FOUND\nSOME HUMANITY AND I GUESS I'LL GIVE HIM THAT 80 DAYS OUT FROM\nTHE ELECTION. >> I'VE GOT TO GET TO A BREAK.\nMARIA, I'VE GOT TO GET TO A BREAK.\nWE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.",

A BIG DONALD TRUMP RALLY SET TO\nSTART SHORTLY IN THE BIG BATTLEGROUND STATE OF FLORIDA.\nDONALD TRUMP SEEMS TO HAVE A NEW POSITION ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION\nWHICH SEEMS LIKE A BIG, BIG DIFFERENCE THAN WHAT HE\nCAMPAIGNED ON FOR MORE THAN A YEAR.\nIN ADDITION TO THAT THERE ARE NEW ATTACKS FROM DONALD TRUMP.\nHE CALLS THE CHLINTON FOUNDATIO THE MOST CORRUPT ENTERPRISE IN\nPOLITICAL HISTORY. THIS COMES AFTER A ASSOCIATED\nPRESS REPORT FOUND THAT MORE THAN HALF OF THE NONGOVERNMENT\nPEOPLE WHO CLINTON MET WITH AS SECRETARY OF STATE GAVE MONEY TO\nTHE CLINTON FOUNDATION. LISTEN TO WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAID\nABOUT IT LAST NIGHT. >> AMERICA CAN NEVER ELECT A\nCANDIDATE WHO, LIKE HILLARY CLINTON, DID GOVERNMENT FAVORS\nFOR THOSE GIVING HER FAMILY AND HER FOUNDATION MASSIVE AMOUNTS\nOF CASH. >> ALL RIGHT, WANT TO GO TO\nFLORIDA NOW, TAMPA, WHERE WE ARE GOING TO SEE THAT DONALD TRUMP\nRALLY IN JUST A SHORT BIT. CNN POLITICAL REPORTER SARA\nMURRAY IS THERE. DONALD TRUMP WITH A LOT TO SAY.\n>> ABSOLUTELY, JOHN, AND DONALD TRUMP HAS REALLY BEEN HAMMERING\nHILLARY CLINTON OVER THIS NOTION OF PAY TO PLAY, ESSENTIALLY\nSAYING SHE USED THE STATE DEPARTMENT TO GRANT ACCESS TO\nFAVORS, TO DONORS TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nTAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT HER CHIEF STRATEGIST HAD TO SAY ABOUT THAT\nTODAY. >> PEOPLE GIVE DONATIONS TO THIS\nFOUNDATION BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE IN THE WORK IN THIS FOUNDATION.\nAND TO SAY THAT MEETING WITH 84 PEOPLE OUT OF 3,000 PEOPLE\nYOU'VE MET WITH OVER THE SPAN OF YOUR TENURE SAYS SOMETHING, YOU\nKNOW, EVEN INAPPROPRIATE IS GOING ON I THINK IS A COMPLETELY\nFLAWED PREMISE. THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH THE AP\nREPORT. >> SO THAT'S HOW THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN IS SORT OF EXPLAINING THESE DONATIONS.\nIF YOU THINK DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO ACCEPT THAT EXPLANATION\nAND STOP TEARING INTO HILLARY CLINTON OVER THIS, I WOULDN'T\nEXPECT IT. THIS IS A VERY POTENT LINE OF\nATTACK. THE OTHER STORY LINE WE'VE SEEN\nIS WILL HE OR WON'T HE CHANGE HIS STANCE ON IMMIGRATION.\nTHIS HAS BEEN A CORNERSTONE OF HIS CAMPAIGN AND IT'S ONE OF THE\nTHINGS THAT REALLY RILES UP A CROWD.\nWE HAVE NOT SEEN HIM CHANGE HIS TONE ON THE STUMP.\nHE STILL MAKES THESE CALLS TO BUILD A WALL.\nHE STILL CALLS FOR EXTREME VETTING FOR PEOPLE COMING TO THE\nUNITED STATES. IN MEDIA INTERVIEWS, HE'S\nSHOWING SOME INKINGLES. >> THERE CERTAINLY MAY BE A\nSOFTENING. WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO HURT\nPEOPLE. WE HAVE SOME GREAT PEOPLE IN\nTHIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE SOME GREAT, GREAT PEOPLE\nIN THIS COUNTRY. BUT WE'RE GOING TO FOLLOW THE\nLAWS OF THIS COUNTRY. >> ANY SPECK CIFIC CHANGES --\n>> WHAT PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE, WE HAVE VERY, VERY STRONG LAWS.\n>> NOW THAT IS CLEARLY A VERY DIFFERENT TONE THAN WHAT WE'VE\nHEARD FROM DONALD TRUMP OVER THE LAST YEAR THAN WHAT WE HEAR FROM\nHIM AT THESE RALLIES. IF HE DOES MAKE A SHIFT TO\nSAYING HE'S ONLY GOING TO FOCUS ON DEPORTING PEOPLE WHO HAVE\nBEEN CONVICTED OF CRIMES. THAT'S A BIG SHIFT.\nIT'S VERY CLOSE TO PRESIDENT OBAMA'S POLICY.\n>> ALL RIGHT, SARA MURRAY FOR US IN TAMPA, WHERE DONALD TRUMP IS\nSCHEDULED TO SPEAK SHORTLY. KEEP US POSTED.\nWANT TO DRILL DOWN ON THIS ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION WITH A POLITICIAN\nWHO'S MADE IT REALLY THE CORNERSTONE OF HIS CAREER,\nCONGRESSMAN STEVE KING, REPUBLICAN, FROM IOWA, JOINS US\nNOW BY PHONE. I SHOULD SAY KING WAS A BIG\nSUPPORTER OF CRUZ DURING THE PRIMARIES.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH US.\nWHEN YOU HEAR DONALD TRUMP SAY THAT HE IS OPEN TO THE IDEA OF\nSOFTENING HIS POSITION WHEN IT COMES TO SOME OF THE 11 MILLION\nUNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS IN THIS COUNTRY, WHEN YOU HEAR\nSOFTENING, WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU HEAR?\n>> WELL, COUPLE THAT WITH THE BALANCE OF WHAT HE SAID ALSO.\nTHAT WE'RE GOING TO FOLLOW THE LAWS OF THIS COUNTRY AND WHAT\nPEOPLE DON'T REALIZE, THAT WE HAVE VERY, VERY STRONG LAWS.\nWHEN YOU BALANCE THAT TOGETHER, I THINK WHAT IT SAYS IS THAT IF\nPEOPLE ARE ANTICIPATED THAT THERE WOULD BE A DEPORTATION\nCORPS THAT WOULD BE DEPLOYED ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, THAT S\nSOFTENING MEANS THAT'S LESS LIKELY.\nI'M ONE IN FAVOR OF RESTORING OUR CONNECTIONS AND RELATIONSHIP\nWITH ALL OF OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT SO THEY SUPPLEMENT\nTHE ENFORCEMENT OF IMMIGRATION LAW AS THEY'RE DESIGNED TO DO\nWITH EITHER SINGLE LAW IN THIS COUNTRY.\nI THINK THAT'S WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.\nAND HE SAID TOO WE HAVE THE POLICE FORCE OUT THERE.\nTHEY KNOW WHO PEOPLE ARE. AND LET'S WORK WITH LOCAL LAW\nENFORCEMENT. THEY DIDN'T SAY IT IN THIS\nINTERVIEW. BUT IN THESE SANCTUARY CITIES\nAND ENFORCING THE LAW, THAT WILL KEEP US BUSY FOR A LONG TIME --\n>> CONGRESSMAN -- >> EVEN AT AN ACCELERATED PACE.\nI THINK THAT'S WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.\n>> IT WAS AN ANSWER TO A QUESTION WITH DO YOU FAVOR\nCHANGING LAW IN A WAY THAT MIGHT ACCOMMODATE PEOPLE THAT\nCONTRIBUTE TO SOCIETY, HAD BEEN LAW ABIDING, HAVE KIDS HERE.\nWOULD YOU BE WILLING TO CHANGE THE LAW FOR THEM.\nTO ME, THAT READS, WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO PERHAPS NOT TRY TO\nREMOVE THEM FROM THE COUNTRY. WOULD YOU TRY TO CREATE SOME\nLEGAL STATUS FOR THEM STAYING HERE.\nWOULD YOU BE IN FAVOR OF CREATING SOME LEGAL STATUS FOR\nPEOPLE WHO, AS THE QUESTIONER WAS SAYING, CON TRIBUTE TO\nSOCIETY. >> THE ANSWER WOULD BE THERE\nWOULD BE SOME SOFTENING. WHICH I DIDN'T QUITE HEAR THEY\nWOULD BE WILLING TO CHANGE THE LAW.\nI WOULD PUSH BACK ON THAT AS A MEMBER OF THE IMMIGRATION\nSUBCOMMITTEE AND ONE WHO HAS TAKEN THE LEAD ON THE\nIMMIGRATION ISSUES FOR A LONG TIME.\nI THINK DONALD TRUMP UNDERSTANDS THIS.\nASKED FURTHER ON THIS, I THINK HE WOULD COME BACK TO THIS\nPOINT, WE HAVE TO RESTORE THE RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW IN\nAMERICA. AND PART OF THAT IS TO ENFORCE\nTHE LAWS THAT WE HAVE. IF WE FAIL TO DO THAT, THEN THE\nRESULT OF THAT WILL BE REWARD PEOPLE FOR BREAKING THE LAW\nWHICH MEANS ERODE THE VERY POSITION THAT'S TAKEN HIM TO THE\nNOMINATION. >> EVEN PEOPLE WHO CONTRIBUTE TO\nSOCIETY AND HAVE BEEN LAW ABIDING WHICH WAS THE WAY THE\nQUESTION WAS ASKED. IF YOU ALLOW THEM TO STAY, WOULD\nTHAT BE TANTAMOUNT TO AMNESTY? >> I WOULD SAY YES.\nTHE REASON IS THEY'RE NOT LAW ABIDING IN THE FIRST PLACE.\nBY CROSSING THE BORDER ILLEGALLY, THEY'RE BY DEFINITION\nCRIMINALS. HE HAS SAID HE WANTS TO REMOVE\nTHE CRIMINALS IN THIS COUNTRY. SO I WOULD SAY IT WOULD BE\nTANTAMOUNT TO AMNESTY TO REWARD PEOPLE THAT BREAK THE LAW.\nHE ALSO REINFORCED THE STATEMENT THOSE WHO OVERSTAY THEIR VISA\nHAVE TO GO HOME -- >> SO AGAIN --\n>> -- RESPECT FOR HUMAN DIGNITY IN THIS BUT ENFORCEMENT FOR THE\nLAW. >> -- AS HE PUTS IT CONTRIBUTES\nTO SOCIETY, THAT WOULD BE OPENING THE DOOR TO CALLING AMN?\n>> I WOULD INTERPRET THIS STATEMENT TO BE PERHAPS LESS\nAGGRESSIVE THAN PEOPLE HAVE ANTICIPATED.\nTHAT'S WHERE I HOPE IT STAYS. I WILL CONTINUE TO, MYSELF,\nADVOCATE FOR ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAWS WE HAVE.\nI THINK DONALD TRUMP HASN'T SAID ANYTHING THAT HE WOULD BE\nINCLINED NOT TO. I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH THE\nPACE AND HOW AGGRESSIVE HE MIGHT WANT TO BE.\n>> THAT'S A CHARITABLE READING I THINK OF WHAT DONALD TRUMP HAS\nACTUALLY SAID. BECAUSE HE HASN'T MADE IT CLEAR.\nAND, REMEMBER, YOU OF COURSE WERE A BIG SUPPORTER OF TED CRUZ\nDURING THE PRIMARIES. I'M JUST CURIOUS WHAT YOU WOULD\nHAVE SAID HAD DONALD TRUMP USED THIS LANGUAGE WHEN YOU WERE\nWORKING SO HARD TO GET TED CRUZ ELECTED OR NOMINATED FOR\nPRESIDENT. >> WELL, THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.\nAND THET TONE OF THIS CAMPAIGN SHIFTS ALONG THE WAY.\nI KNOW TED CRUZ HAD STRONG POSITIONS.\nBOTH OF THEM HAD PRETTY MUCH ETCHED IN STONE THEY WOULD BE\nFOR RESTORING THE RESPECT FOR LAW ALONG THE WAY.\nI THINK STILL I HAVE TO -- OF ALL OF THE THINGS DONALD TRUMP\nHAS SAID AND HIS BUOYANCY TO THE NOMINATION HAS RELIED UPON, HIS\nCOMMITMENT TO ENFORCE THE LAW, BUILD A WALL, PUT THE RESPECT\nFOR THE RULE OF LAW BACK IN PLACE AGAIN AND MAKE AMERICA FOR\nAMERICANS AGAIN. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.\nYOU DON'T DO THAT BY ERODING THE RULE OF LAW.\nSO I THINK THERE'S MUCH MORE OUT THERE.\nTHAT SAYS HE'S GOING TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON HIS COMMITMENTS ON\nIMMIGRATION. AND MAYBE, YOU KNOW, JEFF\nSESSIONS BEING PART OF THAT TEAM, AS CLOSE AS HE IS HE'S A\nGOOD FRIEND AND HE WOULD HELP ANCHOR THIS AND I'LL DO MY BEST\nTHE LAW TOGETHER. I'D SAY ALSO WE NEED TO PROVIDE\nFOR THE DIGNITY OF EVERY HUMAN PERSON.\nPART OF THAT IS TO SAY TO THEM RESPECT OUR LAWS.\nSO THAT MEANS THEY HAVE TO BE ENFORCED.\n>> IF HE DID MOVE OFF THIS POSITION, THOUGH, YOU THINK IT\nWOULD BE A MISTAKE? >> OH, I THINK IT WOULD BE A\nMISTAKE IF HE MOVED OFF THIS POSITION, YES.\nTO SOFTEN THE TONE A LITTLE BIT, I THINK THAT'S FINE.\nI THINK IT'S -- TO THE DEGREE SOME OF HIS CRITICS HAVE\nOVERSTATED HIS POSITION HE'S TAKEN.\nI WOULD EXPECT THAT SOFTENING THIS TONE IS SOMETHING THAT MAY\nBE PART OF THIS NEW CAMPAIGN THAT -- AND KELLYANNE CONWAY,\nHIS NEW CAMPAIGN MANAGER IS TERRIFIC, BRILLIANT.\nIT'S AN EXCELLENT CHOICE TO HAVE HER THERE AS CAMPAIGN MANAGER.\nAND SOME OF THIS MIGHT BE SOME OF THE TONAL DIFFERENCE SHE'S\nRECOMMENDING TO DONALD TRUMP. I WOULDN'T DISAGREE WITH\nKELLYANNE. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING\nWITH US. APPRECIATE IT.\n>> THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. >> ALL RIGHT.\nNEW ATTACKS. DONALD TRUMP BLASTING THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION AS THE MOST CORRUPT IN POLITICAL HISTORY BUT\nWITH 76 DAYS TO GO, YOU THINK THIS LINE OF ATTACK WILL MAKE A\nDIFFERENCE?

SOME OF HIS CORE SUPPORTERS WHO\nSUPPORTED HIM BECAUSE OF STRONG STANCE ON IMMIGRATION.\nHE DID TALK IN NOVEMBER OF 2015, HE SAID HE WAS TALKING ABOUT A\nDEPORTATION FORCE SO PEOPLE WOULD BE ROUNDED UP AND\nDEPORTED. NOW, OBVIOUSLY, LISTENING TO\nTHAT SOUND HE IS NOT STAYING BY THAT OR SEEMS TO INDICATE HE IS\nMOVING AWAY FROM THAT. FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO CAME TO\nDONALD TRUMP, NOT BECAUSE HE WAS BIG CELEBRITY, NOT BECAUSE HE\nWAS A DIFFERENT KIND OF A POLITICIAN, BUT BECAUSE OF THEIR\nVIEWS ON IMMIGRATION. THEY WILL BE DISAPPOINTED.\nI THINK HE WILL LOSE SOME OF THOSE.\nTHERE IS QUESTION WHETHER HE WILL BRING IN OTHER PEOPLE.\nA MOVE AIMED TO BRING IN SUBURBAN VOTERS, MANY SUBURBAN\nWOMEN GROWN SKEPTICAL OF HIM OVER THE LAST MONTHS AND THAT IS\nTHE BIG QUESTION.

BUT ABOUT ONE FOURTH OF THE\nENTIRE S&P IS ONLY 2% FROM A NEW HIGH.\nTHAT'S ESSENTIALLY TWO DAYS TRADING.\nSO MY POINT IS, JUST A LITTLE HIGHER AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE\nENORMOUS NUMBERS OF BREAKOUTS WHEN YOU SEE TECHNICIANS REALLY\nSTART TALKING ABOUT THE MARKETS. BUT WE'VE BEEN KNOCKING ON THIS\nDOOR FOR A WHILE AND HAVEN'T HIT IT.\nMEANTIME YOU SEE EXPRESS LOOK AT THAT DOWN 23%.\nTHE NUMBERS ARE KIND OF UGLY HERE.\nCOMPS DOWN 8%. REVENUE IS DOWN 5.7%.\nOVERALL. THERE WERE TWO SPECIFIC\nPROBLEMS. THEY DID TALK ABOUT WEAK\nMERCHANDISE. THAT IS A COMPANY SPECIFIC\nISSUE. OF COURSE THERE'S A LOT OF\nFICKLE CUSTOMER BASE WHEN DEALING WITH THE KIND OF\nMERCHANDISE THEY HAVE. BUT THE WEAK TRAFFIC THAT THEY\nSPECIFICALLY CITED, WE HAVE SEEN THIS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE\nQUARTER FOR THE COMMENTS HERE. LOOK AT THE COMPANIES THAT HAVE\nMENTIONED WEAK TRAFFIC SO FAR. TARGET, MICHAEL KORS, COACH,\nFOSSIL, \"L\" BRANDS P PIER 1, GAP, RALPH LAUREN.\nI COULD GO ON AND ON. THE POINT BEING THAT MAJOR ISSUE\nIS THAT PEOPLE ARE SHOPPING MORE MOBILELY AND THE WEAK TRAFFIC\nNUMBERS ARE SHOWING UP THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY\nHERE. SO THEY ARE NOT ALONE.\nFINALLY, YOU MENTIONED AUGUST 24th, ONE YEAR AGO, THE MINI\nFLASH CRASH. THE DAY THE CHI THESE DEVALUED\nTHE YUAN, A FALL AND THE REASONS WHY THE MARKETS DOWN THERE.\nTHE DOW DROPPED MORE THAN 1,000 POINTS AT THE OPEN.\nIN ADDITION WE HAD MARKET STRUCTURE PROBLEMS.\nTHERE WERE A NUMBER OF DELAYED OPENINGS.\nONLY HALF THE S&P WAS OPEN BY 9:35 AND OVER 1200 TRADING HALTS\nIN STOCKS AS WELL AS ETFs. THESE WERE MAJOR PROBLEMS.\nTHEY WERE A BIG ISSUE FOR THE INDUSTRY.\nTHERE'S BEEN CHANGES MADE IN THE LAST YEAR.\nAND SOME MORE OF THEM ARE COMING.\nFIRST THEY HAVE TRIED TO REDUCE THE DELAYS IN OPENING STOCKS\nOVERALL. SO THERE'S NEW RULES.\nPARTICULARLY AT THE NYSE. THAT ALLOW THEM TO AUTOMATE THE\nOPENING IF THEY NEED TO. THAT HAS DRAMATICALLY REDUCED\nTHE AMOUNT OF DELAYS IN THE OPENINGS.\nAND YOU CAN ALSO SEE THIS IN THE REDUCED TRADING HALTS.\nWE HAVE THESE SINGLE STOCK CIRCUIT BREAKERS AND THEY HAVE\nTWEAKED THESE SINGLE STOCK CIRCUIT BREAKERS TO MAKE IT LESS\nLIKELY THAT THERE WOULD BE TRADING HALTS ON THE FLOOR.\nAND YOU CAN SEE, THIS WHEN YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED ON BREXIT,\nTHIS WAS THE ONLY OTHER DAY WE HAD A BIG VOLATILITY DAY.\nREMEMBER JUNE 24th THE DAY THE BREXIT VOTE WAS COUNTED.\nAUGUST 24, 1200 TRADING HALTS. JUNE 24th SIMILAR VOLATILITY,\nDOW OPENED DOWN 600 BUT ONLY 68 TRADING HALTS AND ALMOST ALL\nSTOCKS OPENED PROMPTLY PARTICULARLY DOWN HERE AT THE\nNEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE. SO GUYS, BREXIT I'M NOT SAYING\nTHERE WASN'T A BIG DOWN DAY, THERE WAS, BUT IT WAS MUCH MORE\nORDERLY. DIDN'T SEE THE TRADING HALTS,\nDIDN'T SEE THE BIG DELAYS, THE INDUSTRY IS TRYING TO ADDRESS\nTHIS ISSUE. THEY'VE ALREADY ISSUED JOINT\nPRESS RELEASES. YOU WILL HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT IN\nTHE NEAR FUTURE. GUYS, BACK TO YOU.\n>> ALL RIGHT. BOB, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nLET'S GET TO THE BOND PITS. RICK SANTELLI AT THE CME IN\nCHICAGO. GOOD MORNING, RICK.\n>> GOOD MORNING, CARL. YOU KNOW I LIKE WHAT BOB IS\nTALKING ABOUT BECAUSE AS WE LOOK AT TODAY, AND A LONG SPAT OF\nVERY COMFORTABLE AT HOME IN THE RANGES IN MARKETS, IT'S\nINTERESTING TO THINK ABOUT FLASH CRASHES AND WHAT WE USED TO CALL\nIN THE OLD DAYS, DISCONTINUOUS VOLATILITY.\nBELIEVE ME YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE END OF IT.\nTHE MORE WE COIL, THE MORE WE'RE GOING TO SEE LARGE MOVES.\nWE DON'T KNOW WHEN. YESTERDAY I USED THE ANALOGY\nLIKE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL. HOURS OF ORDER SURROUNDED BY\nMOMENTS OF TERROR. IT'S GOING TO BE OUT THERE.\nWE'VE CHANGED THE PIPING AND GONE FROM 4 INCH PIPING TO 1\nINCH PIPING AND THERE'S VERY LITTLE TRADING PRESSURE.\nLOOK AT A ONE WEEK OF 5s, AN AUCTION TODAY.\nIT'S CONSOLIDATED. WHAT I FIND FASCINATING NOT ONLY\nTHE FLATTENING OF THE YIELD CURVE, BUT JUST THE DISTANCE\nTRAVELED FOR THE MONTH OF AUGUST BASED ON CLOSES.\nIF YOU LOOK AT A TWO-YEAR PRETTY TIGHT RANGE, LOW TO HIGH YIELD\nCLOSES THE ENTIRE MONTH 11 BASIS POINTS.\nFIVE IS THE WINNER. YOU CAN SEE HOW THESE SHORT\nMATURITIES ARE UP TOWARDS THE TOP OF THE RANGES.\n5s, 13 BASIS POINTS LOW TO HIGH, 103 TO 116 I BELIEVE.\n10s ONLY 9 BASIS POINTS, 1.50 TO 1.59.\nI DON'T SEE ANY WAY WE WILL NOT CONTINUE TO FLATTEN WITH RESPECT\nTO THE DOLLAR AND THE POUND, LOOK AT A MAY 1st START TO THE\nDOLLAR, IT'S A VERY SMALL TURN BUT TRADERS SAY IT LOOKS LIKE\nIT'S HOLDING BUT DON'T LOOK FOR A HUGE BOUNCE WHEREAS YOU\nCONTRAST THAT WITH THE POUND VERSUS THE DOLLAR AND IT'S\nREACTIONARY DOUBLE BOTTOM POST-BREXIT VOLATILITY ONE OF\nTHE BIG TRADES ON THIS TRADING FLOOR.\nCARL, BACK TO YOU. >> ALL RIGHT.\nRICK, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT.\nRICK SANTELLI. OIL WILL BE SOMETHING TO WATCH\nIN ABOUT 45 MINUTES. JACKIE IS AT THE NYMEX.\n>> HEY, GOOD MORNING TO YOU, CARL.\nPRICES ARE LOWER THIS MORNING AFTER THE API REPORTED A\nSURPRISE INVENTORY BUILD IN CRUDE LAST NIGHT OF 4.5 MILLION\nBARRELS. THEY WERE LOOKING FOR A NUMBER\nAROUND 200,000. SO BIG DIFFERENCE THERE.\nMEANTIME THE GASOLINE NUMBERS IN THAT 10:30 REPORT WILL BE KEY AS\nWELL. A DRAW IS EXPECTED OF 1.6\nMILLION BARRELS, BUT REFINERY UTILIZATION COULD BE\nIMPACTED BY THE FLOODING THAT WE SAW IN LOUISIANA.\nSO THAT'S A WILD CARD. NOW IF CRUDE BUILDS BUT GAS\nDRAWS, THAT COULD KIND OF OFFSET EACH OTHER WITHIN THE WTI PRICE,\nBUT WTI IS TRADING RIGHT IN THAT SWEET SPOT RIGHT NOW, BETWEEN 45\nAND $50 AT ABOUT 47.50. STRONGER DOLLAR THAT RICK\nSANTELLI MENTIONED COULD IMPACT THESE PRICES TODAY TO THE\nDOWNSIDE AS WELL. IT'S ALL GOING TO HINGE ON WHAT\nWE HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY AT 10:30.\n>> JACKIE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WHEN WE COME BACK THE FORMER CEO\nOF CONVERSE TECHNOLOGY, HAS A COURT DATE THIS MORNING.\nOUR SCOTT COHEN IS OUTSIDE THE COURTHOUSE IN BROOKLYN.\n>> AND IT IS A COURT DATE, CARL, THAT IS TEN YEARS IN THE MAKING.\nTHE INDICTED CEO OF CONVERSE TECHNOLOGY.\nKOBE ALEXANDER, RETURNING TO THE U.S. FROM AFRICA IN FBI CUSTODY,\nTO PLEAD GUILTY.

JUST TWO TABLESPOONS ARE USED\nOVER THE SIZE OF A FOOTBALL FIELD.\nTHE SMALL AMOUNT DOES NOT POSE A HEALTH RISK TO PEOPLE, ACCORDING\nTO THE CD CONSIDER.

HE'S CHIEF ASTRONOMER OF THE\nFRANKLIN INSTITUTE SCIENCE MUSEUM IN PHILADELPHIA.\nI LOVE TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE THIS.\nBUT I NEED TO ASK YOU AN HONEST QUESTION.\nWHEN WE FIND SOMETHING, IT CON FURMS WHAT I THINK ALL OF US\nPROBABLY ASSUME. BUT IF YOU HAD TO GUESS, WOULD\nYOU SAY THAT THERE IS LIKELY AN INFINITE NUMBER OF PLANETS LIKE\nTHIS IN THE UNIVERSE AND WE JUST HAPPENED TO FIND ONE?\n>> I WOULD SAY THE NUMBER IS VERY HIGH BECAUSE OF THE WORK\nTHAT'S BEEN DONE BY THE KEPLER SPACECRAFT LOOKING AT A SMALL\nSECTION OF OUR GALAXY. WE'VE COME TO THE UNDERSTANDING\nIT'S FAR MORE LIKELY FOR STARS TO HAVE PLANETS THAN TO NOT HAVE\nPLANETS. GIVEN THAT, THAT MEANS IF WE HAD\n300 BILLION STARS IN OUR GALAXY. WE COULD HAVE AT LEAST 300\nBILLION PLANETS. >> IN OUR GALAXY.\n>> IN OUR GALAXY ALONE. >> AND A HUNDRED BILLION IN\nOTHER GALAXIES. >> SO THE NUMBERS GET HIGH.\nBUT PLANETS LIKE THIS ONE, I'D SAY, NOT AN INFINITE NUMBER, BUT\nA SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH NUMBER TO AT LEAST ALLOW US TO BELIEVE\nTHAT THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT ONE DAY WE REALLY WILL FIND ONE\nTHAT ACTUALLY IS LIKE EARTH. >> WHY IS THIS --\n>> I'M SURE THERE'S PLENTY. OKAY, SO -- AND WE'VE BEEN\nSAYING IT'S ONLY FOUR LIGHT YEARS AWAY.\n186,000 MILES PER SECOND AND IT'S HARD TO ACCELERATE HUMANS\nTO THAT SPEED MUCH LESS -- DON'T WE GET -- APPROACH INFINITE MASS\nWHEN WE'RE GOING THAT FAST OR HAVE WE CHANGED THAT?\n>> EINSTEIN HAS IDENTIFIED SOME CHANNELS THERE ARE TO GETTING\nANY OBJECT UP TO THE SPEED OF LIGHT.\nSO WE CAN LET THAT ONE JUST GO. BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY TRY TO\nATTEMPT TO GET OBJECTS OR SPACECRAFT UP TO SOME\nSIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF THE SPEED OF LIGHT AND THEREFORE CUT\nTRAVEL TIME. BUT IT WOULD BE VERY, VERY\nEXPENSIVE ENERGYWISE. YOU KNOW WHAT THE ALTERNATIVE\nIS? WHY NOT SEND SOMETHING THAT'S\nVERY SMALL, VERY LIGHT, VERY COMPACT YET HAS THE CAPABILITY\nTO SEND US THE DATA WE NEED TO HELP US UNDERSTAND OBJECTS AT\nTHAT DISTANCE. SO THAT'S A POSSIBILITY OF A\nPLAN OF SOMETHING THAT COULD REALLY BRING US ALL THE\nINFORMATION WE NEED ABOUT OBJECTS LIKE THIS.\nPARTICULARLY THIS ONE. PROXIMA-B SINCE IT'S SO CLOSE TO\nUS. >> IT IS EXCITING.\nI WONDER WHAT YOU THINK OF WHEN WE SEND UP A SORT OF A DIAGRAM\nOF THE DOUBLE HELIX ASSUMING THAT A SPECIES OR A FORM OF LIFE\nTHAT COULD RECEIVE SOMETHING WOULD BE AT LEAST ADVANCED\nENOUGH TO KNOW WHAT THAT SIGNIFIES.\nIS THERE -- IF MOST MATTER IS CONSTANT THROUGHOUT THE\nUNIVERSE, CAN WE ASSUME THAT THERE'S CARBON -- IF THERE'S\nLIFE SOMEWHERE ELSE, IS IT GOING TO BE CARBON BASED?\nI KNOW IN THIS DAY AND AGE IT'S A HORRIBLE WORD BUT IT'S GOOD\nFOR US IN TERMS OF LIVING. >> YES, CARBON IS VERY IMPORTANT\nFOR LIFE AS WE KNOW IT.

BECAUSE IT'S SUCH AN ELEGANT --\nAND IT HAD 4 BILLION YEARS TO DECIDE THAT'S THE WAY TO DO IT\nWITH EVERY OTHER OPTION THROWN IN THERE.\nAND THAT'S WHAT WE CAME TO. SO I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO\nSEND A PICTURE OF DNA -- >> THAT ASSUMES ALL OF THE\nCHEMICAL -- ALL THE ELEMENTS WE NEED FOR THAT HAPPEN TO BE IN\nTHAT LOCATION IN THAT OTHER LOCATION.\nAND THE CONDITIONS THERE ARE SIMILAR ENOUGH SO THAT THE SAME\nPOSSIBILITY FOR CHEMICAL CHAIN COULD BE POSSIBLE.\nBUT STILL THERE'S A LOT OF PLANETS IT COULD BE.\n>> IS THERE A PROXIMA-A?

SHE'S GOING TO DO NOTHING FOR\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS, SHE'S GOING TO DO NOTHING FOR THE HISPANICS.\nSHE'S ONLY GOING TO TAKE CARE OF HERSELF, HER HUSBAND, HER\nCONSULTANTS, HER DONORS. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE SHE CARE\nABOUT.

IT'S THE FIRST TIME HE'S CALLED\nHER A BIGOT DIRECTLY. WHAT'S YOUR REACTION?\n>> THAT'S GOING TO BE A REALLY HARD SELL FOR A MAN LIKE DONALD\nTRUMP. DONALD TRUMP WAS BEING SUED BY\nTHE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, HILLARY CLINTON WAS GOING\nUNDERCOVER INTO RURAL WHITE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COMING TO\nANDRE AND MY HOME STATE TO HELP TO GET YOUNG AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nJUVENILES OUT OF PRISONS BECAUSE THEY WERE BEING RAPED AND\nTREATED UNFAIRLY AND HARSHLY. SO DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO BE\nHARD PRESSED IN MAKING THAT POINT.\nBUT I DON'T THINK I'VE BEEN CLEAR FOR THE PAST WEEK THAT\nDONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN MAKING THIS QUOTE, UNQUOTE, APPEALS\nMANY ARE CALLING IT BECAUSE I DONG THINK IT'S AN APPEAL.\nYOU HAVE REPUBLICANS IN THIS COUNTRY, PEOPLE LIKE RAND PAUL\nWHO ARE WORKING ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM.\nOTHERS TALKING ABOUT POVERTY IN AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES.\nDONALD TRUMP IS NOT DOING THAT. HE'S BEING EXTREMELY\nCONDESCENDING SAYING AFRICAN-AMERICANS DON'T GRASP\nPOLICY, WHICH IS ALMOST RACIST. >> THIS IS A WOMAN BEHIND DONALD\nTRUMP WHEN HE MADE THAT COMMENT. DID YOU SEE HER?\n>> THAT WAS A CLASSIC. THAT IS HILARIOUS.\n>> SHE NEEDS TO BE ON THE SHOW. >> SHE MAKES THE POINT I WAS\nGOING TO MAKE, IF HIS APPEAL TO SUBURBAN WOMEN, WHITE VOTERS --\n>> IS THAT THE REACTION SUBURBAN WHITE WOMEN WILL HAVE?\n>> GEORGE BUSH GAVE A SPEECH, HE REFERRED TO THE DEMOCRATIC POINT\nOF VIEW TO ONE THAT IS BIGOTED. THIS IS A LINE THAT'S BEEN USED\nBEFORE BY OTHER REPUBLICANS. THE DEFINITION OF A BIGOT IS\nBEING INTOLERANT OF ANOTHER PERSON'S OPINION AND DONALD\nTRUMP HAS PROFFERED AN ALTERNATIVE VIEW FOR CERTAIN\nCOMMUNITIES, AN ALTERNATIVE POLICY THAT THESE COMMUNITIES\nSHOULD LOOK AT? WHAT'S THE RESPONSE?\nMANY PEOPLE CALLED HIM RACIST. THAT'S A FALSE ACCUSATION,\nTHAT'S A BIGOTED WAY OF VIEWING DONALD TRUMP.\nIT'S NOT TOLERATING ANOTHER PERSON'S OPINION.\n>> BUT THAT'S NOT QUITE ACCURATE.\nLET ME JUST SAY WHEN GEORGE W. BUSH TALKED ABOUT LOW\nEXPECTATION, IT WAS A VERY GOOD SPEECH BECAUSE THE WORST PART\nABOUT LOW EXPECTATIONS IS OFTEN TIMES YOU GET WHAT YOU EXPECT.\nBUT I WANT KAYLEIGH TO TELL ME ONE THING WHICH HILLARY CLINTON\nHAS BEEN BIGOTED? >> BECAUSE SHE PAINTS MY\nCANDIDATE AS A RACIST. SHE STOOD ON A STAGE NEXT TO\nELIZABETH WARREN, AND BECAUSE HE PUTS FORTH A POSITIVE, INCLUSIVE\nVISION, ONE THAT BELIEVES IN ECONOMIC PROSPERITY, HE'S\nMENTIONED SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS, HE'S PUT FORTH AN INCLUSIVE\nVISION AND HILLARY CLINTON STOOD ON A STAGE NEXT TO ELIZABETH\nWARREN, AND CALLED MY CANDIDATE A RACIST.\n>> LET ME HELP YOU. >> SHE USED SUPER PREDATOR.\n>> EXACTLY. >> IT'S REALLY UNDER -- BIRTHER\nSTARTED WAY BACK BEFORE DONALD TRUMP CAME IN.\nHER GROUP KIND OF PUSHED THAT BIRTHER MOVEMENT.\n>> NO, THAT'S NOT RIGHT. >> I'M SORRY, THAT'S --\n>> THAT IS A LIE. >> LET ME SAY THIS TO ANDRE\nABOUT THE SUPER PREDATOR COMMENT.\nTHAT COMMENT WAS ABSURD, IT WAS OFFENSIVE, THAT COMMENT WAS VERY\nHURTFUL. ALTHOUGH IT WAS IN 1994, I WAS\nONLY 10 YEARS OLD, WHEN YOU HEAR THOSE TYPE THINGS, WHEN YOU HEAR\nTHE WAY THAT ALTHOUGH WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT IN CONTEXT, SHE\nWASN'T TALKING ABOUT AFRICAN-AMERICAN MALES\nSPECIFICALLY. SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT GANGS AND\nCA CARTELS.\nTHAT LANGUAGE HAD NO PLACE IN THE POLITICAL DISCOURSE.\nI CHALLENGED HILLARY CLINTON ON THAT AND SHE OWNED IT AND\nAPOLOGIZED. I'VE NEVER SEEN DONALD TRUMP\nAPOLOGIZE TO ANYONE OF THE FIVE OF THE CENTRAL PARK FIVE OR TO\nTHE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TRYING TO DELEGITIMIZE\nHIM. SO I UNDERSTAND YOUR TALKING\nPOINT ABOUT SUPER PREDATOR. I FEEL THE SAME WAY.\nBUT I HOPE YOU PUSH YOUR CANDIDATE TO APOLOGIZE FOR HIS\nHARD BIGOTRY. >> HE'S NOT GOING TO --\n>> HE SETTLED -- >> IT WAS NEVER PROVEN IN A\nCOURT OF LAW. >> THE SECOND ONE, THEY COULDN'T\nEVEN COME UP WITH ONE NAME OR >> HE WAS CALLED OUT BY THE\nNAACP.

MORE REPUBLICAN VOTERS HAVE\nTURNED OUT TO VOTE FOR THIS MAN THAN ANY CANDIDATE IN HISTORY.\nWE ARE NOT HATEFUL, WE ARE INCLUSIVE.\nDONALD TRUMP IS INCLUSIVE. I WOULD RETURN TO HER MAYA QUOTE\nWITH A MARTIN LUTHER KING QUOTE, WE MUST LEARN TO LIVE TOGETHER\nAS BROTHERS OR PERISH AS FOOLS. >> BAKARI, WHAT WERE YOU SAYING?\n>> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PUT A MORATORIUM ON THE MARTIN LUTHER\nKING QUOTES, BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY THAT DR.

LET'S PLAY IT.\n>> THIS IS THE MOST HORRIBLE KIND OF BIGOTRY, AND THE FACT\nTHAT PEOPLE KEEP ASKING THE SAME QUESTION, PARTICULARLY TO BLACK\nCOMMENTATORS LIKE ME, IS HE REACHING OUT TO BLACK PEOPLE?\nHE IS NOT REACHING OUT TO BLACK PEOPLE.\nI EVEN LOOKED AT THE LARGEST BLACK WEBSITES THAT I COULD\nFIND, JUST TO SEE IF ANYBODY WAS TAKING HIM SERIOUSLY.\nNOT A SINGLE PERSON THAT I COULD FIND WAS.\nTHE ONLY PEOPLE TAKING HIM SERIOUSLY IS WHITE PEOPLE.\n>> LAST NIGHT ON THIS PROGRAM, HE SAID IF YOU ARE SUPPORTING\nDONALD TRUMP, THEN YOU'RE PART OF THE BIGOTRY THAT IS DONALD\nTRUMP. SOMETHING TO THAT EXTENT.\n>> AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW, BECAUSE I DON'T GO AS FAR AS\nCALLING DONALD TRUMP A RACIST. I DON'T THINK DONALD TRUMP IS A\nRACIST. I HEARD KAYLEIGH QUOTE ME\nEARLIER, I THINK DONALD TRUMP IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN A RACIST.\nHE JUST UTILIZES RACISM. BUT A FAILURE TO DISAVOW DAVID\nDUKE IN HIS INTERVIEW WITH JAKE TAPPER AND COMING BACK LATER\nAFTER THOSE PRIMARIES AND THEN DISAVOWING HIM, BY HAVING THESE\nCONVERSATIONS, MANY TIMES WHAT WE'RE SEEING WITH DONALD TRUMP\nIS YES, HE'S DABBLING IN RACISM. THAT'S WHAT STEVE BANNON DOES AT\nBREET BART.  -- BREITBART.\nTHERE IS NOTHING PURE ABOUT ROGER STONE.\nROGER STONE IS A RACIST, SOMEONE WHO IS VERY CLOSE TO DONALD\nTRUMP.

KING WAS, WHICH WAS TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER AND\nTALK ABOUT TOLERANCE AND BEAT BACK THE BIGOTRY THAT IS DONALD\nTRUMP. SO FOR YOU TO QUOTE DR. KING, IT\nREALLY PAINS ME, BECAUSE IT'S SO INTELLECTUALLY DISINGENUOUS,\nBECAUSE IT DOESN'T REFLECT THE MAN AT ALL.\n>> I DON'T THINK THAT'S VERY UNFAIR.\nI THINK WE'RE ALL ALLOWED TO QUOTE DR.

THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.\nWITH REGARD TO THE CENTRAL PARK FIVE, IT WAS HORRIBLE WHAT\nHAPPENED TO THOSE YOUNG MEN -- >> NO, NO, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE\nCENTRAL PARK FIVE. >> IN 1974, WHO DIDN'T LIVE IN A\nSEGREGATED NEIGHBORHOOD? >> THAT DIDN'T MAKE IT RIGHT.\n>> I'M NOT SAYING IT MADE IT RIGHT OR WRONG, BUT BY YOU'RE\nJUDGING SOMEBODY BY TODAY'S STANDARDS.\n>> I LIVED IN A SEGREGATED NEIGHBORHOOD.\nWE WERE ONE OF THE FIRST BLACK FAMILIES IN A WHITE\nNEIGHBORHOOD, IT WAS TOUGH. >> I'M NOT SAYING IT'S RIGHT,\nBUT YOU'RE USING TODAY'S STANDARDS BY SOMETHING THAT\nHAPPENED LONG AGO. >> WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

IT JUST CONTINUES NOT TO.\nWE ARE SO FAR AWAY FROM ANY DEFINITION OF CRISIS THAT WE'VE\nGOT A POLICY TODAY NOT ONLY HERE BUT NOW GLOBALLY WHICH IS MORE\nAGGRESSIVE THAN IT'S EVER BEEN, PERHAPS, IN THIS RECOVERY.\nAND JUST THE DISCONNECT IS UNBELIEVABLE.\nWE'RE BACK TO FULL EMPLOYMENT UNDER 5%.\nWE'VE GOT THE HIGHEST CORE INFLATION RATE, THE HIGHEST WAGE\nINFLATION RATE OF THE RECOVERY.

A LOT OF THE TIME, THE CRAZIEST\nSTUFF ENDS UP HAPPENING, LIKE BREXIT.\nI DON'T KNOW HOW YOU KNEW ABOUT BREXIT.\nI WAS HOPEFUL, BUT I DIDN'T THINK -- I DIDN'T KNOW IF IT\nWOULD HAPPEN. LIKE RATES, WHICH EVERY TIME\nTHEY SEEM TO GO UP ON THE TEN-YEAR, YOU SAY NO, THEY'RE\nGOING BACK TO -- I DON'T KNOW, WHERE ARE YOU?\n1.25? YOU STILL THINK TRUMP IS GOING\nTO WIN THE PRESIDENCY? YOU STILL THINK THAT?\n>> WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE ELECTIONS TO SOMEONE IN MY\nPOSITION, IT GETS VERY DICEY. I THINK THAT THE ODDS ARE, NOT\nBECAUSE I'M IN FAVOR OF HIM, I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE AN\nELECTION WHERE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO VOTE AGAINST AND CONSEQUENTLY\nI THINK HE HAS A SLIGHT NECK WINNING REGARDLESS OF THE POLLS.\n>> THE SYMBOLISM OF NIGEL FARAGE TRAVELING AROUND OR AT LEAST\nBEING ON BOARD, YOU COULDN'T HELP, BUT NOTICE THAT SORT OF\nSOMETHING THAT IS NOT JUST HAPPENING IN THESE BOARDS, BUT\nTHE ANTI-GLOBALISM PUSH IN THE REASSERTION OF NATIONALISM.\nLET ME GET TO THE NEXT THING. THERE'S NO -- VIX IS LIKE YOU\nCOULD HAVE BOUGHT THAT AND IT'S LIKE WATCHING PAINT DRY AT THIS\nPOINT. OR WATCHING GRASS DRY OR PAINT\nGROW. AT THIS POINT, IS ALL THE\nCENTRAL BANK INTERVENTION, I WAS LIKENING IT TO ANESTHESIA.\nYOU DON'T REALLY FEEL ANYTHING. IT'S LIKE THE DENTIST, YOU DON'T\nFEEL IT UNTIL THE NOVOCAIN WEARS OFF.\nAND I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE DID, BUT I NEED TYLENOL OR SOMETHING.\nARE WE BEING LULLED? THE DOG DAYS OF AUGUST IS THAT\nTHE REASON OR CENTRAL BANKS CAUSING THINGS TO GO WHERE THEY\nWOULD NOT NORMALLY GO. >> JOE, YOU'RE LAST SENTENCE WAS\nTHE EXACT RIGHT EMPHASIS ON THESE MARKETS.\nWE HAVE ABOUT $220 BILLION A MONTH, THAT'S EVERY MONTH,\nCOMING OUT OF THE JAPANESE AND EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANKS.\nWE HAVE THE FED HOLDING INVENTORY OF AROUND $4 TRILLION.\nAND WHAT WE REALLY HAVE UNLIKE ALL THE DECADES THAT I'VE BEEN\nON WALL STREET UP UNTIL THE LAST ONE, WE HAVE CENTRAL BANKS THAT\nINFLUENCE THE MARKETS AND NOW THEY ARE CONTROLLING THE\nMARKETS. BOTH THE BOND AND THE EQUITY\nMARKETS, WHICH IS WHY I CALL OUR CURRENT ENVIRONMENT WONDERER\nLAND BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE I THINK WE ARE, IN SOME\nKIND OF SPACE THAT NO ONE HAS BEEN IN BEFORE.\nWE WENT DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE. >> IS THE FED THE DOG OR IS IT\nTHE TAIL? MOST PEOPLE THINK THE GLOBAL\nECONOMY, YOU KNOW, THE SUMMER SAVINGS, THE LACK OF DEMAND, THE\nABUNDANCE OF SUPPLY, THAT CENTRAL BANKERS ALL THEY'RE\nDOING IS RESPONDING TO THE OVERALL MALAISE THAT WE'RE\nSEEING AND THEY'RE NOT CAUSING IT.\nTHEY'RE JUST RESPONDING TO IT. >> I DON'T BUY THAT ARGUMENT,\nJOE. I THINK IN THE BEGINNING AFTER\nTHE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 2008 AND 2009, ALL THE CENTRAL BANKS IN\nTANDEM BY THE WAY RESPONDED TO TRY TO CLARIFY AND GET US OUT OF\nTHAT SITUATION. NOW, EIGHT YEARS LATER, I THINK\nWHAT'S HAPPENING IS THAT THE DEBT THAT HAS BEEN ISSUED BY THE\nEUROPEAN COUNTRIES, BY JAPAN HAS CAUSED THE CENTRAL BANKS THERE\nTO STEP INTO THE MARKET IN WAYS THEY'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE.\nWE NOW HAVE $13.7 TRILLION IN NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES BONDS\nACROSS THE WORLD, ACCORDING TO FITCH.\nTHE FED IS JUST STANDING PAT, BUT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF THE\nMONEY, JOE, FROM EUROPE AND ASIA IS ROLLING INTO THE AMERICAN\nMARKETS BECAUSE AMERICA IS THE ONLY MAN LEFT.\nTHE ONLY MAN STANDING THAT HAS POSITIVE YIELDS.\n>> SO WHICH MARKETS THAT PEOPLE ARE INVESTED IN ARE OVER VALUED\nAND WHAT IS THE MOST OVERVALUED AND ARE THERE ANY MARKETS WHERE\nTHIS DISLOCATION FROM THE FED WHERE IT CAUSES THEM TO BE\nUNDERVALUED? >> WELL, INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH,\nIF YOU LOOK AT THE CORPORATE MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES,\nCORPORATE BONDS, MORTGAGE BONDS IN THE UNITED STATES, THEY'VE\nTIGHTENED THE TREASURIES OVER THE LAST MONTH ABOUT 20 BASIS\nPOINTS, BUT I STILL THINK THERE'S GOOD VALUES THERE.\n>> OKAY. >> TREASURIES IS COMPARED TO THE\nBONDS IN EUROPE OR THE BONDS IN ASIA.\nTHEY'RE STILL DECEDENT VALUE IN OUR TREASURY MARKET BECAUSE IT'S\nTHE ONLY PLACE LEFT WITH ANY POSITIVE YIELD.\nTHE EQUITY MARKET IS VERY STRETCHED.\nWE'VE HAD TWO YEARS NOW OF EARNINGS DECLINE.\nWE HAVE PE MULTIPLES THAT ARE WITHIN VERY SMALL SPACE OF\nALL-TIME HIGHS AND I UNDERSTAND THE REASON FOR THIS.\nTHE REASON IS THIS TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF CAPITAL OF MONEY\nTHAT'S POURING INTO THE ALL THE WORLD'S MARKETS WHICH IS LIKE A\nHOPE FLOATS. IT'S A LOT OF HOPE AND IT'S\nFLOATING. >> I MEAN, I THINK IT'S\nINTERESTING YOU SAID -- I MEAN YOU MADE THE CASE FOR THE ENTIRE\nGLOBE BEING IN A BOND MARKET BUBBLE.\nJUST BECAUSE OUR YIELDS ARE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER, YOU STILL\nTHINK THAT'S TA PLACE TO INVEST. YOU HAVE A COMPLETELY ARTIFICIAL\nBOND MARKET BUBBLE, BUT YOU'RE STILL READY TO BUY OUR BONDS.\nEVEN THOUGH IT'S A BUBBLE. I DON'T SEE WHY YOU DON'T THINK\nSINCE OR ECONOMY IS GOING A LITTLE FASTER, WHY DON'T YOU\nTHINK EVEN THE STOCK MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD ARE OVERVALUED,\nWE'VE STILL GOT THE BEST ONE. GOT THE ONE WITH THE BEST\nECONOMY. WHY NOT BUY STOCKS AND BONDS\nTHEN. >> WELL, JOE, I THINK THAT WHAT\nYOU'RE SAYING CORRECT. WE DID HAVE THE BEST EQUITY\nMARKET. CERTAINLY IN MY OPINION THE\nSAFEST EQUITY MARKET RIGHT NOW. I JUST THINK THAT INTEREST RATES\nARE SO LOW, JOE, THAT WE'RE NOT EVEN COMING CLOSE THOUGH THE\nINFLATION RATE IN THE TEN-YEAR TREASURY, MUCH LESS IN THE\n5-YEAR TREASURY. YOU'RE SLOWLY LOSING MONEY\nBECAUSE OF THE OVERALL INFLATION RATE.\nHOWEVER, I'M A BIG FAN, AS I SAID TO YOU BEFORE, IF YOU KNOW\nWHAT YOU'RE DOING, YOU CAN GET 10% ON YOUR MONEY.\nI THINK FOR INDIVIDUALS, YOU BUY CORPORATE BONDS, YOU TAKE HALF\nYOUR MONEY AND BUY CLOSED END BOND FUNDS.\nYOU HAVE RETURN OF AROUND 7% LENDED AND I'LL TAKE THAT EVERY\nDAY. THAT'S WHAT I TELL PEOPLE THEY\nSHOULD BE DOING WITH THEIR MONEY THESE DAYS.\nINDIVIDUALS. >> ALL RIGHT.\nWHERE'S DAVIE? >> WEST OF FORT LAUDERDALE.\n>> OKAY. YOU'VE GOT LIKE OFF ON OR\nSOMETHING? IS IT MOVING UP THAT WAY?\nARE YOU WORRIED? >> NO.\nI'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT ANYTHING. I'M CHARGING AHEAD.\n>> ALL RIGHT. NOT YET TO FORT LAUDERDALE.\nJUST PARTS OF MIAMI, IS THE ALL RIGHT.\nYOU CAN ALWAYS COME UP HERE.

IN THE MEANTIME TO THE CME AND\nTHE AFOREMENTIONED RICK SANTELLI.\nHEY, RICK. >> HI.\nFORGET IT, I'M GOING WITH ALL THE SMOKE BE STORIES.\nTHE MIRRORS ARE ON THEIR WAY TO JACKSON HOLE AS WE SPEAK.\nI WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME MY SPECIAL GUEST PETER BOOKFAR.\nTHANKS FOR TAKING THE TIME THIS MORNING, PETER.\n>> ALWAYS GOOD TO BE WITH YOU, RICK.\n>> YOU KNOW, I WAS GOING TO KEEP JACKSON HOLE UNTIL LAST BUT NICE\nTHING ABOUT LIVE TV IS I'M SWITCHING IT AROUND.\nLET'S START OUT WITH JACKSON HOLE.\nI REALLY DO THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF SMOKE AND MIRRORS\nTHERE, BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER. WE'RE TALKING OFF CAMERA AND\nYOUR COMMENT WAS, JACKSON HOLE IS GOING TO HAVE A BIG POTENTIAL\nTO MOVE THE MARKETS. EXPLAIN.\n>> WELL, IF YELLEN IS VERY DOVISH, THEN WE CAN SAY OKAY,\nFISHER AND DUDLEY NOW DISAGREE WITH YELLEN.\nIF SHE'S HAWKISH, AND SETS US UP FOR A SEPTEMBER RATE HIKE, WELL\nTHE MARKET, OBVIOUSLY, WILL TAKE THAT VERY POORLY BECAUSE IT'S\nCERTAINLY NOT SET UP FOR A SEPTEMBER RATE HIKE.\nAND THEN FAST FORWARD TO SEPTEMBER, IF SHE ACTUALLY\nDOESN'T FOLLOW THROUGH, WELL THEN WHATEVER SHRED OF\nCREDIBILITY THE FED HAS, THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE.\nTHERE'S A SMALL NEEDLE FOR HER TO THREAD.\nUNFORTUNATELY, SHE'S PUT HERSELF IN THE POSITION OF HAVING TO\nTHREAD THAT. BUT THAT'S THE SITUATION WE'RE\nIN. >> RIGHT.\nOF COURSE WHILE ALL OF THAT OCCURS THAT YOU APTLY WENT\nTHROUGH, IT DOESN'T CHANGE WHERE GDP IS.\nIT DOESN'T CHANGE THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, DOESN'T\nCHANGE THE EMPLOYED RATE, DOESN'T CHANGE THE PARTICIPATION\nRATE, IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FUNDAMENTALS.\nBUT, MAYBE IF WE CALLED IT REFORM INSTEAD OF NORMALIZATION\nWE WOULD GET SOMEWHERE. LET'S GO TO THAT.\nYOU NOTICED LIEBORE, SHORT-TERM RATES, COMMERCIAL PAPER, WHAT\nWAS THE ISSUE WHEN COMMERCIAL PAPER ROSE DURING THE CREDIT\nCRISIS? DO YOU REMEMBER HOW THAT PLAYED\nOUT? >> IT WAS MESSY, NO BANK WANTED\nTO DO BUSINESS WITH ANOTHER BANK.\nSHORT-TERM MONEY MARKETS FROZE UP.\nTHIS IS DIFFERENT THAT IT'S A REGULATORY CHANGE.\nREGARDLESS OF WHAT THE REASON IS, LIE BORE IS UP 52 BASIS\nPOINTS YEAR OVER YEAR -- >> EVERYTHING.\nYOU COULD LOOK AT ALL THE LIBOR. >> EXACTLY.\n>> SO THIS IS A TIGHTENING AND I DON'T SEE THE MARKET FALLING\nAPART, I DON'T SEE THE FIRMS LIKE THE GEs OF THE WORLD, YOU\nKNOW, THEIR COST TO BORROW HAS GONE UP AS YOU POINTED OUT MORE\nTHAN A TIGHTENING WOULD HAVE CAUSED.\nTHE WORLD DIDN'T COME TO AN END, DID IT?\n>> THE MARKET HAS TIGHTENED. REGARDLESS OF WHAT YELLEN SAYS\nOR DOES ON FRIDAY OR IN SEPTEMBER, SHORT-TERM LIBOR\nMARKETS HAVE TIGHTENED POLICY BY AN ADDITIONAL 25 BASIS POINTS.\n>> YOU KNOW, PETER, I'M GOING TO GO ON RECORD AND I'VE BEEN ON\nRECORD, THERE'S ONLY ONE THING THAT CAN HAPPEN RIGHT NOW AND\nTHAT'S A FLATTER YIELD CURVE. I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER WAY AROUND\nIT. REAL QUICKLY, WITH AROUND\nIT. WE'RE OUT OF TIME.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT COMMENT?\n>> I AGREE BECAUSE GLOBAL GROWTH CONTINUES TO SLOW.\nBUT, I DO BELIEVE THAT THE LONG END OF THE YIELD CURVE CENTRAL\nBANKERS ARE LOSING SOME CONTROL AND I DO EXPECT THE INFLATION\nSTATISTIC TO START TO MOVE HIGHER OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS\nWHICH LEADS TO A RISE OF LONGER TERM INTEREST RATES.\n>> WE'LL DEFINITELY SEE.

ESPECIALLY JANET YELLEN'S SPEECH\nWHICH COMES UP ON FRIDAY. WE'LL HAVE FED SPEAKERS TALK\nABOUT THAT IN A MINUTE. WE WANT TO GIVE THE RESULTS OF\nTHE CNBC FED SURVEY JACKSON HOLE EDITION.\nAND THEY'RE GOING TO BE DEBATING HERE MONETARY POLICY FRAMEWORK.\nAS YOU'LL SEE IN A SECOND, MOST PEOPLE ON WALL STREET DON'T\nTHINK THE FED HAS A FRAMEWORK FOR MONETARY POLICY.\nLET'S LOOK AT THE OUTLOOK FOR RATES.\nYOU CAN SEE THEY'VE PUSHED IT ALL BACK ONCE AGAIN.\nIT WAS DECEMBER 2016. THE AVERAGE RESPONDENT WAS\nEXPECTING THE FIRST MOVE NOW, IT'S JANUARY 2017.\nWHEN DO THEY THINK THE BALANCE SHEET WILL DECLINE?\nAFTER MAY 2017. THAT'S BEEN PUSHED BACK AGAIN.\nTHE TERMINAL RATE, STILL EXPECTED TO BE HIT IN THE FOURTH\nQUARTER OF 2018. 2.29% IS WHERE THEY BELIEVE THE\nFEDERAL RESERVE WILL STOP. YOU CAN SEE HERE IN THE NEXT\nSCREEN, WHAT YOU'LL SEE IS THE OUTLOOK FOR FUNDS RATE THIS\nYEAR. 1.22% AND 1.87%.\nTHEY THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF TIGHTENING TO COME BUT\nNEAR TERM VERY LITTLE. LET'S LOOK AT WHAT PEOPLE THINK\nABOUT HOW THE FED MAKES POLICY. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY DON'T\nTHINK THEY DO IT VERY WELL. WE ASKED DO YOU THINK B THE FED\nIS MAKING POLICY BASED ON THE LATEST ECONOMIC DATA?\nJUST 38% SAY THE FED FOLLOWS ITS OWN METRIC WHICH IS THE MEDIUM\nTERM ECONOMIC OUTLOOK. 16% DON'T KNOW AND THEY'RE\nUNSURE. 39 ECONOMISTS, FUND MANAGERS\nPOLLED HERE. ONE MORE THING HERE, DOES THE\nFED HAVE A FRAMEWORK? 60% SAY NO.\nTHERE'S NO FRAMEWORK OUT THERE. AND AGAIN, THE 16% DON'T KNOW.\nHERE'S SOME OF THE COMMENTARY. A LOT OF FRUSTRATION, A LOT OF\nCONFUSION ON WALL STREET. THE FED HAS FAILED TO COME TO A\nCONSENSUS ON COMMUNICATIONS. THE BLOW TO CREDIBILITY IS\nLEAVING MARKETS PRICING A FORM OF INFINITE EASING.\nAND JOEL NAROFF SAYS WHEN YOU BASE POLICY ON CURRENT DATA THAT\nARE VOLATILE, YOU GET VOLATILE POLICY STATEMENTS.\nTOUGH GO ONLINE TO SEE WHAT PETER BROOKEVAR SAID.\nTOMORROW WE HAVE ESTHER GEORGE FROM THE KANSAS CITY FED.\nOVER THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS WE'LL HAVE FIRST ON INTERVIEWS HERE\nFROM FEDERAL RESERVE. BACK TO YOU.\n>> THEY'RE GOING TO BE GREAT TO HAVE HER ON TOMORROW MORNING.\nTERRIFIC. >> Reporter: YEAH.\nNICE AND WARM OUT HERE. >> YEAH.\nSO YOU MEANT THE TETONS ARE GONE.\nTHEY'RE STILL THERE, RIGHT? WE JUST CAN'T SEE THEM.\n>> Reporter: WELL, WE DON'T KNOW, JOE.\nWE DON'T KNOW. THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION YOU ASK.\n>> USUALLY THEY'RE THERE. >> Reporter: WE'VE BEEN MEANING\nTO SEND ONE OF OUR CREW MEMBERS OUT THERE ACROSS THE PLAIN HERE.\nBUT WE KNOW THERE'S BEARS AND MOOSE IN THERE.\nSO NOBODY'S ACTUALLY VOLUNTEERED TO MAKE THE TREK.\n>> I BET YOU THEY'RE STILL THERE.\nTHAT'S JUST A -- >> Reporter: YOU KNOW WHAT WE'LL\nDO, JOE? IF THEY APPEAR WE'LL DO A\nBREAK-IN LIVE SHOT ON THAT. >> AND WE'VE TALKED STEVE INTO\nGOING OUT TO JACKSON HOLE. GEE, STEVE.\nTHAT'S ROUGH ONE. THANKS FOR DOING THAT FOR US,\nSTEVE. REALLY.\n>> Reporter: THEY THREATENED TO FIRE ME IF I DIDN'T GO.\nIT WAS -- I DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT.\n>> AND HAVE YOU DONE THIS YET? HAVE YOU DONE?\n>> HE CAN'T SEE THAT PROBABLY. >> HE'S CASTING.\n>> Reporter: WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS WRONG.\nYOU'VE GOT TO STOP 10:00, 2:00. >> YOU KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.\nTHAT'S OUT OF THE SHOT. THAT'S OUT OF THE SHOT.\n>> Reporter: NO. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS.\nTHIS IS FLAILING LIKE THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER.\nTHAT'S HOW HE FLY FISHES. >> ALL RIGHT.\nFORGET IT. FOR MORE ON THIS WEEK'S BIG FED\nGATHERING, LET'S BRING IN ED LAZEAR.\nA SENIOR FELLOW AT THE HOOVER INSTITUTION.\nHE'S ALSO THE FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE PRESIDENT'S COUNCIL OF\nECONOMIC ADVISERS. AND I CAN'T REMEMBER LAST TIME\nWE TALKED WHETHER YOU THINK WE'RE BEHIND THE CURVE.\nBUT ONE FACT THAT I'LL LET YOU START WITH IS THE DOLLAR IS\nLOWER THAN IT WAS AND WE HAD A RATE INCREASE.\nSO IS THAT WHOLE IDEA THAT WE'RE GOING TO -- YOU KNOW, THERE'S\nCURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS THAT WILL BE -- THAT WILL GO AGAINST WHAT\nOUR INTENTIONS -- WHAT WE WANT TO HAPPEN.\nIS THAT WHY THEY DON'T DO IT? DOES THAT HOLD TRUE ANYMORE?\n>> I DON'T THINK SO. THIS COMES BACK TO THE POINT\nSTEVE WAS MAKING EARLIER ABOUT WHETHER THEY HAVE A MODEL.\nREMEMBER, THERE ARE LOTS OF INDIVIDUALS ON THIS COMMITTEE\nAND EACH INDIVIDUAL HAS THEIR OWN MODEL IN THEIR HEADS.\nBUT THE MAIN THING IS THAT WHEN YOU SEE THE DATA AND THAT FEEDS\nINTO THESE MODEL, THE DATA HAVE NOT BEEN PARTICULARLY STRONG AND\nHAVEN'T BEEN PARTICULARLY CONSISTENT.\nSO JUST GOING BACK TO WHAT YOU SAID A MINUTE AGO, JOE, WHEN YOU\nSAY BEHIND THE CURVE, THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN THAT AS THEY'VE\nBEEN LOOKING AT THE DATA, NO MATTER WHICH MODEL YOU USE, THEY\nHAVEN'T HAD A CONSISTENT PERIOD DURING WHICH THEY COULD ACTUALLY\nACT IN A CONSISTENT WAY TO RAISE RATES.\nSO NOW WE'RE SITTING AT A POINT IN THE BUSINESS CYCLE WHERE\nNORMALLY WE WOULD BE AT THE PEAK OF RATES.\nAND WE'D BE LOOKING IF ANYTHING TO LOWER RATES OR KEEP THEM\nSTABLE. AND NOW WE'VE GOT A SITUATION\nWHERE THE FED NEEDS TO BE THINKING ABOUT A LONG RUN UPWARD\nTRAJECTORY. AND THAT'S KIND OF BACKWARDS.\nIT DOESN'T FIT THE HISTORY, UNFORTUNATELY.\n>> BLESS YOU. >> THANK YOU.\n>> GOT TO LET IT OUT, MAN. >> I WAS TRYING TO HOLD ONTO\nTHAT. >> YOU COULD GET A HERNIA.\n>> I SNEEZED. I WAS TRYING TO HOLD ONTO IT.\n>> IT JUST MEANS I SAID THE TRUTH.\nYOU KNOW THAT. >> THERE'S A HISTAMINE REACTION\nIF YOU LOOK IN THE SUN. SO ED, SO ANY MORE WILL THERE BE\nA SEPTEMBER OR DECEMBER? I KNOW THERE WILL BE, BUT THERE\nL THERE BE A HIKE IN EITHER MONTH?\n>> I DOUBT IT. I DON'T WANT TO BRING POLITICS\nINTO THIS, BUT NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO, IT'S POLITICAL.\nIF THEY RAISE RATES AND THAT HAS ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES FOR\nMARKETS, THAT'S POLITICAL. IF THEY DON'T RAISE RATES AND\nTHAT FAVORS THE INCUMBENT, THAT'S POLITICAL.\nAGAIN, I THINK THE MAIN THING YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT AND YOU ASK\nWHY DID THE FED DO THIS, I'LL COME TO THEIR DEFENSE.\nWHILE STEVE WAS JUST REPORTING WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING IS A BIT\nHARSH. THE REASON IT'S HARSH IS IF\nYOU'RE A POLICY MAKER AND YOU'RE LOOKING TO RAISE RATES AND YOU\nSEE DATA THAT KEEPS COMING IN AND SAYS, GEE, GDP IS AT 2%.\nRECENTLY IT'S BEEN AT 1%. THE LABOR MARKET IS NOT BACK\nWHERE IT SHOULD BE DESPITE THE FACT WE HAVE 4.9% UNEMPLOYMENT. HOUSING STARTS ARE STABLE, BUT\nTHEY'RE LOW. WE'RE NOT REALLY BACK TO WHERE\nWE SHOULD BE. AND IF I'M JANET OR BEN BERNANKE\nAND THINKING WHAT SHOULD I BE DOING RIGHT NOW, I CAN'T SAY\nTHAT I'M CONFIDENT THAT THIS ECONOMY IS ON A STRONG\nTRAJECTORY. SO THAT'S THE REASON THAT THEY\nHAVEN'T DONE IT. BUT UNFORTUNATELY GIVEN THAT\nPOSTURE FROM THE PAST, WE'RE SITTING IN A POSITION RIGHT NOW\nWHERE WE SHOULD NOT BE AT THIS POINT IN THE BUSINESS CYCLE.\n>> WE GOT TO GO, I GUESS. THE ONLY THING I WAS GOING TO\nASK IS IS IT REALLY A 4.9% JOB MARKET OR IS IT A 60%\nPARTICIPATION RATE JOB MARKET? >> RIGHT.\nYEAH. I THINK THAT THE UNEMPLOYMENT\nRATE OVERSTATES THE STRENGTH OF THE LABOR MARKET.\nI'D SAY WE'RE CLOSER TO THE HIGH FIVE PERCENTAGE RANGE.\nTHE KEY NUMBER IS TO LOOK AT THE EMPLOYMENT RATE.\nTHE EMPLOYMENT RATE IS 59.7%. THAT'S WAY DOWN FROM WHERE IT\nSHOULD BE. EVEN IF WE CORRECT FOR\nDEMOGRAPHICS. >> I KNOW.\n>> SO YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT QUITE THERE.\n>> I AGREE. ALL RIGHT.\nTHANK YOU. I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT SAY THAT.\nTHANKS, ED. >> THANK YOU, JOE.\nGOOD TO TALK WITH YOU.",

SHE'S WITH HILLARY CLINTON DAY\nAND NIGHT SENDING HER E-MAILS CONSTANTLY.\nYOU CAN SEE IN THE RECORD HERE. AND SHE'S ALSO WEARING ALL THESE\nDIFFERENT HATS ASSOCIATED WITH ALL THESE DIFFERENT CLINTON ENTITYS THAT ARE IN AND AROUND\nTHE CLINTON ORBIT. AND THERE ARE A BUNCH OF THEM.\nSO THE COMPLEXITY HERE IS REALLY DIFFICULT TO UNPACK.\nAND THAT'S WHAT REPORTERS ARE TRYING TO DO RIGHT NOW.\nIT RAISES THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THERE'S A CONFLICT OF\nINTEREST HERE. BUT POLITICALLY FOR THE CLINTON\nTEAM IT REALLY POINTS TO THE FACT THAT THERE'S A LOT HERE FOR\nREPORTERS TO GO THROUGH. AND THERE ARE A LOT OF ENTITYS\nTHAT ARE HOSTILE TO HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHIS WILL CONTINUE TO CHURN UP STORIES FOR THE NEXT COMING\nMONTHS. THEY'LL JUST HAVE TO DEAL WITH\nTHIS POLITICALLY. WE'LL SEE IF IT CAUSES ANY\nDAMAGE TO HER IN THE POLLS WHICH HAVE BEEN IN HER FAVOR LATELY.\n>> KEEPING YOU BUSY. >> YOU BET.\n>> LET'S DISCUSS THAT WITH DICK MORRIS, SENIOR ADVISOR AND CON DANT TO THE CLINTONS INCLUDING\nTHEIR TIME IN THE WHITE HOUSE. LATEST BOOK CALLED \"ARMAGEDDON,\"\nHOW TRUMP CAN BEAT HILLARY. WELCOME BACK TO \"POWER LUNCH.\"\nWHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE HILLARY CLINTON SITUATION TODAY?\n>> WELL, IN REVELATION THAT OUT OF 150 PEOPLE WHO VISITED HER IN\nTHE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE DURING HER TENURE, IF YOU\nEXCLUDE STAFF EMPLOYEES OR REPRESENTATIVES OF FOREIGN\nGOVERNMENTS, 150 PEOPLE FROM OUTSIDE --\n>> YEAH, THIS IS THE A.P. STORY YOU'RE CITING.\n>> YEAH. 85 OF THEM WERE DONORS TO THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION. A MAJORITY OF THEM.\nSO IT'S LIKE SHE HAD A CASH REGISTER ON THE RECEPTIONIST\nDESK, CA-CHING. >> DICK, IF YOU WERE STILL\nTHERE, WHAT WOULD YOU ADVISE THEM TO DO ABOUT THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION? >> OH, LORD, CLOSE IT DOWN.\nANNOUNCE YOU'LL KEEP IT CLOSED. SHOW THAT YOU'VE LEARNED YOUR\nLESSON. YOU KNOW, WHEN I WORKED FOR BILL\nCLINTON IN 1980, HE HAD JUST LOST THE GOVERNORSHIP AND HE\nHIRED ME BACK TO GET HIM BACK IN.\nI DIDN'T DO THE LOSING CAMPAIGN. FIRST THING I DID WAS TO GET HIM\nTO APOLOGIZE FOR RAISING TAXES. WHAT HILLARY NEEDS TO DO IS SAY\nI REALIZE THAT THERE ARE CONFLICTS WITH THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION. I'M NOT GOING TO LET THAT HAPPEN\nIF I'M PRESIDENT. AND WE'RE GOING TO CLOSE IT\nDOWN. BUT SHE WON'T DO THAT.\nBECAUSE WHEN I KNEW THE CLINTONS, THIS IS THE POINT I\nMAKE IN \"ARMAGEDDON,\" THEY WANTED MONEY IN ORDER TO GET\nPOWER. GIVE ME CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS.\nNOW THEY WANT POWER IN ORDER TO MAKE MONEY.\n>> I DON'T THINK SHE'S GOING TO DO IT BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T NEED\nTO DO IT. BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT\nTHESE TWO CANDIDATES AND THEY'RE SAYING, OKAY, THEY'RE BOTH\nFLAWED AND I PICK HER FLAWS OR I PICK HIS FLAWS.\nAND THEY'RE NOT -- I DON'T THINK ANY NEW E-MAIL REVELATIONS, EVEN\nIF THEY'RE INCREDIBLY GHASTLY WILL CHANGE THE MINDS OF THE\nPEOPLE WHO HAVE SAID, OKAY, SHE'S FLAWED, I DON'T REALLY\nLIKE THE SMELL OF THE E-MAILS BUT I'VE MADE A DECISION THAT\nHER FLAWS ARE MORE ACCEPTABLE THAN HIS.\nBECAUSE WE REALLY GOT THIS FIGHT OF WHO'S LESS ATTRACTIVE.\nSO SHE'S NOT GOING TO APOLOGIZE BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T NEED TO.\n>> BUT THE POLLING SUGGESTS OTHERWISE.\nHER REAL CLEAR POLITICS AVERAGE HAS GONE DOWN FROM 7.8 LEAD NINE\nDAYS AGO TO 5.1 NOW IN A TWO-WAY RACE.\nAND TO 3-POINT SOMETHING IN A FOUR-WAY RACE.\nTHERE'S A REAL EVIDENCE AT THIS POINT THAT THIS SCANDAL IS\nDAMAGING HILLARY. AND IT'S NOT THE E-MAILS PER SE\nANY MORE THAN IN THE WATERGATE IT WAS THE TAPES.\nIT'S WHAT'S ON THEM. >> SO YOU THINK THERE ARE\nUNDECIDED PEOPLE WHO ARE WATCHING THIS E-MAIL SCANDAL\nUNFOLD AND THEY'RE SORT OF SAYING, HMM, ALL RIGHT, THIS IS\nTHE FINAL STRAW FOR ME. AND THAT WE'RE SEEING AS SHE\nGOES TOWN TRUMP GO UP BECAUSE OF THE E-MAIL SCANDALS?\n>> WELL, I THINK TRUMP IS GOING UP, WHICH HE IS IN THE POLLING,\nBECAUSE HE'S BEHAVING HIMSELF. HE'S NO LONGER GETTING INTO --\n>> WELL, FOR NOW, RIGHT? >> -- FOR TWO WEEKS HE HASN'T\nSAID ANYTHING STUPID. THAT'S KIND OF A RECORD.\nHE'S DOING -- >> SAID BY A GUY WHO SUPPORTS\nHIM, RIGHT? CAN WE SAY THAT?\nYOU SUPPORT HIM? >> WELL, I DO.\nBECAUSE I THINK THAT ULTIMATELY -- HE HAD A LEARNING\nCURVE TO LEARN HOW TO BE A GENERAL ELECTION CANDIDATE IN\nTHE UNITED STATES. IT'S A TOUGH THING TO DO.\nAND WHAT THAT INVOLVED IS NEVER SAYING ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE\nSCRIPTED TELEPROMPTER STUFF THAT HE'S PLANNED AND THOUGHT\nTHROUGH, POLLED AND REHEARSED. BECAUSE IF YOU SAY ANYTHING\nELSE, THE MEDIA POUNCES ON IT AND OVERWHELMS YOUR MESSAGE.\nAND THAT'S NOT HAPPENING NOW. >> YOU DON'T WIN THE ELECTION\nNATIONALLY, YOU WIN IT STATE BY STATE.\nAND IN THE KEY STATES THAT EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT, BOTH\nCAMPAIGNS ACKNOWLEDGED WHAT MATTERS, OHIO, FLORIDA,\nPENNSYLVANIA, NORTH CAROLINA, COMPETITIVE BUT TRAILING.\nDO YOU THINK HE HAS TIME TO TURN THAT AROUND AND WIN THOSE\nSTATES? EVERYBODY SEEMS TO THINK THEY'RE\nMUST-GETS. >> YEAH, SURE HE DOES.\nREMEMBER THAT IN THE SUMMER AUGUST OF 2004, KERRY WAS 7\nPOINTS AHEAD OF BUSH. AND DUKAKIS WAS 17 POINTS AHEAD\nOF BUSH SENIOR. AND BUSH WHO LOST THE POPULAR\nVOTE WAS 16 POINTS AHEAD OF GORE.\nTHERE ARE MAJOR CHANGES POSSIBLE.\nAND BEAR IN MIND WHEN YOU LOOK AT INDIVIDUAL STATE POLLING,\nTHOSE TEND TO BE OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME.\nAND THEY ARE LESS VALUABLE IN REFLECTING MINUTE-TO-MINUTE\nTRENDS. I THINK THAT TRUMP SCORED VERY\nWELL LAST WEEK. AND I THINK CLINTON'S HAVING THE\nTOUGHEST TIME SHE'S HAD SINCE REALLY THE MIDDLE OF JULY.\n>> DICK, HOW MUCH OF THIS ELECTION IS GOING TO BE ABOUT\nPEOPLE NOT VOTING FOR WHO THEY LIKE BUT VOTING AGAINST WHO THEY\nDON'T? >> ALL OF IT.\nI THINK THAT WILL BE A HUGE FACTOR.\n>> THAT SUCKS. >> AND THERE'S ONE VERY\nIMPORTANT ELEMENT HERE, GARY JOHNSON, THE THIRD CANDIDATE,\nTHE LIBERTARIAN CANDIDATE. ALL OF THE POLLING SHOWS THAT HE\nHURTS HILLARY MORE THAN HE HURTS TRUMP.\nHILLARY'S VOTE SHARE GOES DOWN BY 3 POINTS, TRUMP'S GOES DOWN\nBY 1 POINT WHEN YOU BRING GARY JOHNSON INTO IT.\nNORMALLY THE LIBERTARIAN CANDIDATE HURTS THE REPUBLICAN.\n>> THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT, YEAH. >> BUT IN THIS CASE IT'S HURTING\nHILLARY MORE. >> DO YOU THINK HE CAN GET\nENOUGH -- SORRY TO JUMP IN, WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.\nDO YOU THINK GARY JOHNSON CAN GET ENOUGH VOTES -- I KNOW HE'D\nHATE THIS TERM BUT TO MAKE A THIRD PARTY CANDIDATE VIABLE IN\nTHE FUTURE? >> WELL, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE\nFUTURE, BUT WHAT HE WILL DO, I THINK, IS GET 15% IN THE POLLS\nWHICH PUTS HIM IN THE DEBATE. >> WOW.\n>> AND ONCE HE'S IN THE DEBATES, THEN HE REALLY COULD GO UP INTO\nTHE HIGH TEENS AND LOW 20s. REMEMBER ROSS PEROT GOT 19% OF\nTHE VOTE IN '92, AND THAT HELPED BILL CLINTON GET ELECTED.\n>> WOW. DICK, THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING\nUS. >> THANK YOU.\n>> HIS LATEST BOOK IS CALLED ",

THE CLINTON GLOBAL INITIATIVE.\nSHE'S MORE OF A GLOBAL CANDIDATE AND DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO DO\nSOMETHING HERE AT HOME FIRST. >> SO THAT'S TRUE.\nI GUESS I'M READING YOUR NOTES, ONE OF THE MAIN THINGS THAT\nBROUGHT YOU TRUMP'S WAY, HE SPOKE OPENLY AGAINST THE FREE\nTRADE AGREEMENT.

ACTUALLY, 44 DEMOCRATS WITH TWO\nINDEPENDENTS HERE IN GREEN, WHO CAUCUS WITH THE DEMOCRATS.\nSO WE PUT THOSE TWO IN THE DEMOCRAT'S COLUMN.\nDEMOCRATS NEED TO PICK UP FIVE SEATS TO TAKE BACK CONTROL OF\nTHE MAJORITY. REPUBLICANS ARE DEFENDING 4\nSENATE SEATS THIS YEAR. DEMOCRATS ARE ONLY DEFENDING\nTEN. WE FOCUS ON THIS MAP ON THE 13\nSTATES THAT ARE THE HOTTEST CONTESTS THAT COULD SEE A\nCHANGE. NEW HAMPSHIRE, PENNSYLVANIA,\nNORTH CAROLINA, FLORIDA, OHIO, INDIANA, ILLINOIS, WISCONSIN,\nIOWA, MISSOURI, COLORADO, ARIZONA, AND NEVADA.\nIF THE ELECTION WERE HELD TODAY, BASED ON THE AVERAGE OF POLLS\nTODAY IN EACH OF THESE 13 STATES, HERE'S WHAT THE MAP\nWOULD LOOK LIKE. DEMOCRATS WOULD PICK UP FOUR\nSEATS AND THE SENATE, AS YOU SEE HERE, WOULD BE TIED.\n50-50. THE CONTROL OF THE U.S. SENATE\nWOULD THEN BE DECIDED BY WHICH PARTY WON THE PRESIDENCY.\nIF HILLARY CLINTON WON, VICE PRESIDENT KAINE WOULD BREAK THE\nTIE.

A REPUBLICAN HAS -- YOU GOTTA\nWIN OHIO IF YOU'RE A REPUBLICAN TO WIN THE NATION, AND AS YOU\nCAN SEE, HE'S OUTSIDE THE MARGIN OF ERROR THERE AND IS LOSING THE\nSPREAD SECRETARY CLINTON 4.8. WHAT DO YOU SEE IN THE TRENDS\nHERE? >> THE TRENDS ARE IN GENERAL\nTHAT TRUMP JUST HAS A LOT OF GROUND TO MAKE UP SORT OF IN ALL\nTHE IMPORTANT STATES. HE'S CLOSE IN NORTH CAROLINA, AS\nYOU JUST TALKED ABOUT, THAT'S A CLOSE RACE, BUT MITT ROMNEY WON\nIN 2012, THAT'S A STATE HE NEEDS TO KEEP AND HE NEEDS TO WIN OVER\nSEVERAL THAT DEMOCRATS HAVE HAD, SO, YOU KNOW, OHIO IS CRITICAL\nFOR HIM, AS ARE A FEW OTHER BIG STATES, AND YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW,\nHE'S TRAILING. >> AND FLORIDA IS ANOTHER ONE OF\nTHOSE. SUNSHINE STATE DECIDED BY THE I I-4 CORRIDOR, FROM TAMPA UP TO DAYTONA BEACH, AND IT LOOKS LIKE\nHE'S HAVING BIG TROUBLE THERE, RIGHT?\n>> YES, IT IS, AND FLORIDA IS A PARTICULAR PROBLEM FOR HIM NOT\nJUST THERE, BUT ALSO WITH THE HISPANIC POPULATION, WHICH IS\nMUCH BIGGER IN FLORIDA THAN IT IS IN OTHER STATES.\nSO FLORIDA IS A MUCH MORE DIVERSE STATE, AND DONALD TRUMP\nHAS NOT DONE WELL WHERE THERE IS A LOT OF RACIAL DIVERSITY, SO\nTHAT'S ANOTHER CHALLENGE FOR HIM.\n>> YOU MENTIONED NORTH CAROLINA, BUT PENNSYLVANIA IS ONE THAT\nTHEY BELIEVED FROM THE BEGINNING THEY REALLY NEED TO GET AND THE\nNUMBERS IN PENNSYLVANIA IF YOU'RE A DONALD TRUMP FAN ARE\nNOT GOOD, PART OF THIS IS THE SUBURBS OF PHILADELPHIA, AN AREA\nIN WHICH THERE WAS WIDESPREAD BELIEF DONALD TRUMP MIGHT HAVE\nSOME TRANSACTION AS HIS CAMP BEGAN.\nWHAT'S YOUR REPORTING FROM \"THE JOURNAL\" NOW?\n>> I THINK IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT STATE TO KEEP OUR EYE\nON. PENNSYLVANIA IS A STATE THAT'S\nTRADITIONALLY BEEN DEMOCRATIC, BUT IS A MUST-WIN FOR TRUMP.\nON THE FLIP SIDE, IF HILLARY IS ABLE TO KEEP PENNSYLVANIA IN HER\nCOLUMN, IT'S VERY HARD TO SEE HOW TRUMP CAN BEAT HER.\nIT BECOMES A VERY IMPORTANT STATE.\nAS YOU SAID, THE PHILADELPHIA SUBURBS, THESE ARE AREAS WHERE\nTHERE ARE VOTERS WHO MIGHT TRADITIONALLY VOTE REPUBLICAN,\nWHO THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS AGGRESSIVELY COURTING,\nESPECIALLY SUBURBAN WOMEN. OF COURSE TRUMP IS GOING AFTER\nTHE VOTERS, YOU KNOW, CROSS THE VAST PARTS OF THE REST OF THE\nSTATE, WHITE-WORKING CLASS VOTERS TRYING TO PUMP UP HIS\nMARGIN THERE. THE QUESTION IS WHETHER HE IS\nINCREASE THE MARGINS ENOUGH THERE TO MAKE UP FOR LOSSES IN\nPHILLY, THAN MITT ROMNEY DID IN 2012 AND ALL OF THAT IS AN OPEN\nQUESTION. >> WHAT ARE HIS PEOPLE SAYING TO\nYOU AND OTHER \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" REPORTERS, ABOUT HIS\nACTIVITIES IN THOSE STATES AND WHAT THEIR PLAN IS?\n>> YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE ANY SPECIAL INSIGHT INTO\nTHE TRUMP PLAN IN TERMS OF WINNING PENNSYLVANIA, BUT I\nTHINK THAT YOU SEE HIM SPENDING A LOT OF TIME THERE AND IN THE\nOTHER THREE STATES WE MENTIONED. WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHETHER HE'S\nSTARTING TO SPEND MONEY, HE PUT HIS FIRST TV ADs ON THE AIR AND\nIT WAS IN THESE FOUR STATES SO YOU SEE THAT'S WHERE THE FOCUS\nOF HIS ENERGY IS, AND I THINK THAT YOU DO -- ARE GOING TO SEE\nHIM TRYING TO WIN THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THE LOYAL SUPPORTERS TO HIM\nAND TO TRY TO REALLY INCREASE THOSE MARGINS.\nIT'S NOT JUST ABOUT PERSUADING PEOPLE.\nIT'S ALSO ABOUT TURNING OUT THE PEOPLE WHO ALREADY LIKE YOU.\n>> LAURA MECHLER, NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER, A CORPORATE\nCOUSIN OF OURS, \"WALL STREET  STUFF AT WSJ.COM.\n>> THANK YOU.",

IT'S GONE ON FOR FIVE YEARS AND\nHAS BECOME A DISASTER BY THE WEEK.\nWE STILL DON'T HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY.\nTHAT'S THE BIGGEST ISSUE. THIS IS WHERE WE NEED A\nCOMMANDER IN CHIEF WHO UNDERSTANDS NATURALLY WHAT TO DO\nTO DEFEAT ISIS. WE HAVE A COMMANDER IN CHIEF WHO\nISN'T COMMITTED TO THE CAUSE. THAT'S LED TO FRICTION IN THE\nUNITED STATES. THEY'VE ADDED FOR MORE\nCOMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY FOR MONTHS, FOR YEARS, AND THEY\nHAVEN'T GIVEN IT.

SHE USED IT TO BENEFIT HER\nOUTSIDE ACTIVITIES. >> HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THOSE\nWHO SAY YOU ARE HELPING TO ELECT HER BY HELPING DONALD TRUMP IN\nSOME OF THE STATES WHERE HE HAS A CHANCE.\n>> DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T HAVE A CHANCE OF BEATING HILLARY\nCLINTON AND I URGE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO\nHAVE SUPPORTED DONALD TRUMP TO CONSIDER.\nHE'S DOING TERRIBLY IN NATIONAL POLLS AND IN KEY BATTLEGROUND\nSTATES. >> HE HAS CLEANED IT UP.\nHE E HAS NEW LEADERSHIP ON THE TOP OF THE CAMPAIGN.\nTHEY WOULD SAY HE'S CERTAINLY NOT OUT OF THE HUNT.\n>> THAT'S A BATTLEGROUND STATE THAT SHOULD BE CLOSED ESPECIALLY\nAGAINST A WEAK CANDIDATE LIKE HILLARY CLINTON.\nANY PUBLIC DEFENDER SHOULD BE DEFEATING HILLARY CLINTON IN THE\nPOLLS REGULARLY AND THAT'S NOT HAPPENING.\nHE'S DOING TERRIBLY. YES, HE'S BEEN MORE ON MESSAGE\nIN THE PAST WEEK OR SO. HE'S NOT A SERIOUS CANDIDATE.\nI'M THE ONLY CONSERVATIVE IN THIS RACE, I WANT TO BE VERY\nCLEAR ABOUT THAT. IT'S TIME FOR THE AMERICAN\nPEOPLE, ESPECIALLY CONSERVATIVES, TO RE-EVALUATE\nAND GIVE ME A CHANCE TO EVALUATE HILLARY CLINTON DIRECTLY.\n>> HE FAIR AND SQUARE WON THAT NOMINATION AND THAT'S WHERE WE\nARE TODAY. HE IS A LEGITIMATE CANDIDATE FOR\nPRESIDENT. >> LEGITIMATE.\nI'M SAYING HE'S NOT COMPETITIVE. HE CANNOT WIN AND WILL NOT WIN.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT IMMIGRATION. THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF\nATTENTION PAID TO REMARKS HE'S MADE PRIVATELY AND NOW MORE\nPUBLICLY THAT SEEMS TO BE A BIT OF AN EVOLUTION FOR HIM ALTHOUGH\nHIS CAMPAIGN SAYS THERE'S NO MATERIAL CHANGE.\nHE WAS SO HARD CORE ON THIS IN THE PRIMARIES AND DECIMATED SOME\nOF HIS OPPONENTS BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT HE WAS TOO SOFT.\nWHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS. IS THERE A CHANGE?\n>> THERE'S CLEARLY A CHANGE. LOOK.\nTHIS IS A GUY WHO HAS NOT BEEN AND IS NOT HONEST WITH THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE. WE CAN'T HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO\nLIES TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN ORDER TO CURRY POLITICAL FAVOR\nONLY TO HAVE TO TURN AND MAKE A 180-DEGREE TURN IN A GENERAL\nELECTION AS IS THE CASE NOW IN ORDER OF HAVING A FIGHTING\nCHANCE OF WINNING, WHICH HE DOESN'T.\nTHAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE. IF I WAS A TRUMP SUPPORTER, I\nWOULD FEEL TOTALLY BETRAYED RIGHT NOW.\nWE NEED LEADERS WHO WILL TELL THE TRUTH EVEN WHEN IT'S HARD,\nWHEN IT'S NOT PLITTIC. >> PEOPLE SAY YOU'RE HELPING\nHILLARY CLINTON CLINTON. SHE OR WHOEVER WINS HAS TO GET\nTO 270 ELECTORAL VOTES. IF YOU HAVE A SHOT, WHAT YOU'RE\nTRYING TO DO IS KEEP EITHER ONE FROM GETTING TO 270.\nSHE HAS A COMMANDING LEAD IN THE POLLS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE\nNUMBERS THAT SHE'S GOT. WHAT IS YOUR PATH.\n>> YOU'RE RIGHT. SHE DOES HAVE A COMMANDING LEAD.\nIT UNDERSCORES THE ABILITY THAT THEY DO NOT COMPETE.\nSHE'S A CORRUPT POLITICIAN THAT CAN BE DEFEATED IF CONSERVATIVES\nAND THE REST OF AMERICA CAN FIELD A CANDIDATE THAT ISN'T\nDONALD TRUMP, WE'D HAVE A BETTER CHANCE.\nTHIS IS THE THING. WE WILL HAVE TO COMPETE WITH\nHILLARY CLINTON FOR CERTAIN STATES.\nWE'RE PREPARED TO DO THAT. ONE OF THE BIGGEST SURPRISES\nTHAT I'VE HAD IN THE TWO WEEKS I HAVE BEEN CAMPAIGNING IS I HAVE\nDEMOCRATS. THEY COME IN TO ME SAYING, LOOK,\nI KNOW I DON'T AGREE WITH YOU ON ALL THE ISSUES.\nSOCIAL ISSUES, ET CETERA, BUT I TRUST YOU AND I'M GOING TO VOTE\nFOR YOU. THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS\nCOUNTRY. THE COUNTRY IS READY FOR A NEW\nGENERATION OF LEADERSHIP AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO\nPROVIDE. >> ALL RIGHT.\nWE'LL WATCH AS YOU DO SOMETHING THAT'S VERY UNCONVENTIONAL AND\nVERY LATE IN THE GAME AND KEEP TRACK OF WHAT MAY BE PROGRESS\nFOR YOU.

I JOINED AT 19.\nSOMEONE SAID TO ME, PATRICK, YOU'RE ON A DEAN'S LIST IN\nCOLLEGE, CAPTAIN OF THE COLLEGIATE HOCKEY TEAM.\nWHY WOULD YOU JOIN? YOU DON'T HAVE TO.\nA LOT OF MILLENNIALS RIGHT NOW -- AND WE'RE IN A TALENT\nMANAGEMENT BUSINESS. WE BRING IN OVER 100,000\nAMERICANS A YEAR. WE HAVE 1 MILLION SOLDIERS,\nMEANING ACTIVE DUTY, NATIONAL GUARD, AND RESERVES.\nMILLENNIALS WANT TO BE PART OF AN ORGANIZATION BIGGER THAN\nTHEMSELVES. OUR RECRUITMENT IS GOOD RIGHT\nNOW. THEY KNOW THE UNITED STATES\nARMY, WHICH IS AMERICA'S VARSITY TEAM, DOES WHAT'S NECESSARY,\nWHETHER IT'S A GOVERNOR OF THE STATE, THE PRESIDENT OF THE\nUNITED STATES, WHEN THEY CALL 911, THEY'RE CALLING OUR ARMY.\nIT'S FOR HOME GAMES AND AWAY GAMES.\nIN LOUISIANA, WE LOST 13 AMERICANS TO THE FLOODING THERE.\nWE HAVE OVER 1300 TROOPS, LOUISIANA NATIONAL GUARD\nMEMBERS, THERE ON THE GROUND HELPING PEOPLE.\nTHAT'S WHAT WE DO. AND WE HAVE AWAY GAMES AS THE\nWELL, LIKE IN IRAQ OR IN AFGHANISTAN, TO MAKE SURE WE\nKEEP OUR FAMILIES SAFE AT HOME AND WE DON'T LOOK THE OTHER WAY\nWHEN HUMAN ATROCITIES ARE HAPPENING.\n>> THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF STINK THAT CAME UP FROM THE ARMY.\nTHERE WAS SOME KIND OF SLIDE IN A PRESENTATION THAT HAD HILLARY\nCLINTON BEING SEEN AS A RECRUITING TOOL FOR ISIS.\nI KNOW IT'S BEEN REMOVED. WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT ABOUT\nTHAT? >> WE'RE LOOKING INTO IT.\nTHE BOTTOM LINE IS IT WAS A POLITICAL STATEMENT THAT SOMEONE\nPUT IN THERE. WE DON'T TALK POLITICS.\nWE'RE AN A-POLITICAL ORGANIZATION.\nI SERVED AS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS BEFORE, BUT I TAKE AN OATH LIKE\nEVERY OTHER SOLDIER IN OUR ARMY TO SUPPORT AND DEFEND THE\nCONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES AGAINST ALL ENEMIES AND\nTO NOT BE POLITICAL. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WAS\nADDRESSED THAT WE WON'T SEE AGAIN.\n>> AS SOMEBODY WHO'S HAD THEIR LIFE PROTECTED BY U.S. FORCES\nABROAD, AS YOU KNOW, WE'RE WITH THE TROOPS AND WE SEE THE\nEXCELLENCE OF CHARACTER. THEY OFTEN HAVE POLITICS FOISTED\nUPON THEM, BUT THEY'RE VERY RARELY POLITICAL THEMSELVES.\nLET ME ASK YOU ASKING. ARWA DAMON IS THAT INVESTIGATIVE\nJOURNALIST YOU WERE TALK ABOUT. SHE BEATS A STEADY DRUM IN THESE\nSITUATIONS. YOU HAVE TO WIN THE MILITARY\nFIGHT, BUT THE FIGHT THAT FOLLOWS IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT.\nTHAT IS IGNORED HERE AS A ROOT CAUSE OF A PROBLEM WE'RE DEALING\nWITH, WITH ISIS. HOW BIG A DEAL IS THE AFTERMATH?\nYOU TAKE -- THEY TAKE OVER MOSUL, BUT NOW WHAT?\nHUMANITARIAN, THE POLITICAL STRUGGLE.\nHOW BIG IS THAT? >> THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SEEING.\nTHAT'S WHY, YOU KNOW, FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, SECRETARY OF\nDEFENSE ASH CARTER, SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY WORKING SIDE BY\nSIDE. IT'S ABOUT THE ECONOMIC AND\nDIPLOMATIC POWER AND FORCE THAT WE NEED TO USE.\nAS FAR AS OUR PART IN THE ARMY, THAT'S WHY WE'RE PARTNERING TO\nMAKE SURE THAT THE MOSUL DAM IS UP.\nOUR CORPS OF ENGINEERS IS PARTNERING WITH AN ITALIAN\nCOMPANY TO MAKE SURE THAT DOESN'T GO IN FURTHER DECLINE.\nTHINGS LIKE THAT MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE.\nDIPLOMACY IS JUST, IF NOT MORE, IMPORTANT AS MILITARY POWER.\nTHAT'S WHY WE'RE WORKING TO BRING OTHER PARTNERS IN THAT\nREGION TO STAND UP WITH THE IRAQI PEOPLE.\nTHAT'S WHY THE NEWS ABOUT TURKEY GETTING THERE TO TAKE FIGHT TO\nINCREDIBLE PROGRESS WE'VE SEEN WITHIN THE LAST SEVERAL HOURS.\n>> PATRICK MURPHY, THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE AND YOUR SERVICE.\n>> THANK YOU, CHRIS. >> GREAT TO HAVE YOU ON \"NEW\nDAY.\"",
