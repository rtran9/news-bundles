I WANT TO SHOW YOU THIS, THE\nBRICK, THE MORTAR, THE CONCRETE CONTINUES TO PILE UP.\nIF YOU FOLLOW ME DOWN HERE QUICKLY, YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THE\nEXCAVATORS HERE DIGGING SLOWLY, PULLING AWAY SOME OF THE\nCONCRETE CHUNKS THERE LOOKING FOR PEOPLE.\nBUT THE CHANCES OF FINDING PEOPLE BURIED BENEATH THE RUBBLE\nALIVE ARE SEEMINGLY DECREASING BY THE HOUR.\nA CHILD'S SCHOOL BOOKS LAY AMONG THE DEBRIS OF WHAT WAS ONCE AN\nAPARTMENT COMPLEX IN AMATRICE. IT WAS DESTROYED BY THE\nEARTHQUAKE WEDNESDAY MORNING. SEARCH AND RESCUE TEAMS CONTINUE\nTO LOOK FOR SURVIVORS AS PEOPLE WAIT AND HOPE FOR SOME SIGN OF\nLIFE. LIKE A 10-YEAR-OLD GIRL TEAMS\nPULLED FROM THE RUBBLE LAST NIGHT.\nONE OF THE FEW TALES OF SURVIVAL.\nTODAY, SOME PEOPLE WERE BRIEFLY ALLOWED BACK INTO THEIR HOMES TO\nCOLLECT VALUABLES, LIKE THOSE IN THE SMALL TOWN, ALSO DECIMATED\nBY WEDNESDAY'S EARTHQUAKE WITH MUCH OF IT LOOKING LIKE IT WAS\nGROUND INTO ASH. THIS MAN SAID HIS FAMILY WAS TOO\nAFRAID TO RETURN HOME, SLEEPING IN HIS CAR INSTEAD.\nLIKE SO MANY OTHERS, THEY FEAR ANOTHER MASSIVE EARTHQUAKE.\nTHEIR FEARS HEIGHTENED BY THE CONSTANT AFTER SHOCKS.\nA STRONG 4.3 TREMOR STRUCK CENTRAL ITALY AGAIN TODAY,\nSENDING RESCUERS SCRAMBLING, AND WARNING JOURNALISTS AND\nBYSTANDERS TO LEAVE THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAINSIDE TOWN\nIMMEDIATELY, BECAUSE IT WAS CRUMBLING.\nAND BACK HERE ON THE GROUND, YOU CAN SEE THE EXCAVATOR SLOWLY\nPULLING AWAY THE CONCRETE.

NOW AS WE GO INTO THE THIRD DAY\nOF SEARCHING, WE'RE GETTING TO THAT CRITICAL 72-HOUR MARK.\nSTILL, THERE'S A LOT OF HOPE. OFFICIALS ARE QUICK TO POINT OUT\nTHAT BACK IN 2009, AFTER A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE HERE IN CENTRAL\nITALY, THEY DID FIND SOMEBODY AFTER 72 HOURS BEING TRAPPED\nUNDERNEATH THE RUBBLE. SO HOPE REMAINS.\nTIME IS OF THE ESSENCE, HOWEVER AND TIME IS RUNNING OUT.\nLET ME SHOW YOU THIS REAL QUICK, BRET.\nTHEY HAVE A LOT TO WORK WITH. THIS USED TO BE AN APARTMENT\nCOMPLEX.

STOCKS GIVING UP THEIR GAINS,\nTHE DOW WAS UP MORE THAN 100 POINTS EARLIER.\nBUT WE'LL SHOW YOU IN A SECOND MOVING LOWER IN THE WAKE OF THE\nFED. THE FDA SAYS IT NOI WANTS ALL\nU.S. BLOOD BANKS, ALL OF THEM, TO START SCREENING FOR THE ZIKA\nVIRUS. THE DEATH TOLL RISING AGAIN IN\nCENTRAL ITALY FOLLOWING WEDNESDAY'S MASSIVE EARTHQUAKE.\nWE'LL HAVE THE LATEST FROM THE SCENE STRAIGHT AHEAD.\nWE HAVE A BIG TWO HOURS HEADED YOUR WAY.\nFIRST, LET'S BEGIN WITH THAT BIG ABOUTFACE IN THE MARKETS.\nBOB PISANI IS LIVE AT THE NYSE. THIS IS ABOUT DIGESTING WHAT\nJANET YELLEN SAID OR DIDN'T SAY, BOB.\n>> AND FISHER, EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY.\nLET'S CALL IT GOOD COP AND BAD COP.\nI JUST WANT TO SHOW YOU A CHART OF WHAT HAPPENED HERE.\nSO YELLEN COMES ON AT ROUGHLY 10:00 EASTERN TIME.\nAND THE IMPORTANT THING FOR THE MARKET OVERALL HERE WAS SHE\nBASICALLY SAID, LOOK, I BELIEVE THE CASE FOR AN INCREASE IN THE\nFED FUNDS RATE HAS STRENGTHENED IN RECENT MONTHS.\nTHERE'S HER ONE HAWKISH STATEMENT, BUT THEN THREW IN A\nLOT OF QUALIFIERS THAT MADE THE ODDS OF A SEPTEMBER HIKE ARE NOT\nDRAMATICALLY MORE. SO UP EIGHT, NINE POINTS.\nTHEN STAN FISHER COMES ON WITH STEVE LIESMAN SAYING YES TO BOTH\nQUESTIONS AND A SECOND RATE HIKE MIGHT OCCUR LATER IN THE YEAR.\nWELL, YOU'LL NOTICE THE MARKET DROPPED TWICE AS MUCH, ABOUT 15\nPOINTS AS IT WENT UP UNDER YELLEN.\nTHIS GIVES A VERY CLEAR INDICATION ABOUT WHAT THE\nMARKETS' CONCERNS ARE. WE'VE BEEN SAYING THIS FOR A FEW\nDAYS AND THAT IS WITH STOCKS AT NEW HIGHS, THE RISK IS TO THE\nDOWNSIDE THAT JANET YELLEN'S RELATIVELY MILD COMMENTS WOULD\nONLY MOVE STOCKS UP A LITTER. BUT ONCE STAN FISHER CAME OUT\nAND SAID SEPTEMBER WAS VERY, VERY REAL AND AGGRESSIVE ON HIS\nSTATEMENT, THAT MOVED STOCKS DOWN MUCH MORE OVERALL HERE.\nYOU CAN SEE THIS AS WELL IN THE REACTION IN THE TWO-YEAR NOTE\nWHICH IS GENERALLY VERY SENSITIVE TO ANYTHING THE FED\nSAYS. YOU SEE MOVING DOWN SLIGHTLY\nTHERE. THERE'S YOUR TWO-YEAR NOTE,\nTHANK YOU. MOVING DOWN LARGELY SIDEWAYS,\nBUT THE MOMENT FISHER COME OUT, THAT WAS JUST BEFORE 12:00, YOU\nSEE THE NOTE MOVING TO THE UPSIDE.\nCLEAR REACTION FROM STAN FISHER. AS FOR THE VIX AND VIX FUTURES,\nYOU CAN SEE THE CONFUSION HERE. GENERALLY MOVING TO THE\nDOWNSIDE, MOVING TO THE LOWS OF THE DAY.\nJUST AS YELLEN CAME OUT. AND THEN AS FISHER WAS TALKING\nMOVED UP, OH, ABOUT A FULL POINT AND A HALF OVERALL.\nLET'S JUST CALL IT GOOD COP, BAD COP.\nBACK TO YOU. >> ALL RIGHT, BOB, THANK YOU\nVERY MUCH. IF IT'S FRIDAY NEAR 1:00 THAT\nMEANS THE RIG COUNTS ARE OUT. AND AFTER WEEKS OF ADDING OIL\nRIGS, WE ARE UNCHANGED. ACCORDING TO BAKER HUGHES THERE\nWERE ZERO NEW OIL RIGS ADDED. OIL HOLDING STUDY UP 0.3% TO\n47.47. BUT NO CHANGE.\nFIRST TIME IN",

THERE WERE OTHER COMMENTS\nFOLLOWING UP ON THIS THAT HEDGED THAT.\nWHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN? YELLEN IMPLIED THAT EVERY\nMEETING WAS POTENTIALLY LIVE BUT DID NOTHING TO INDICATE THAT\nSEPTEMBER WAS MORE LIKELY THAN TRADERS THOUGHT BEFORE AND THE\nMARKETS REACTED NATIONALLY TO THIS.\nI SAID EARLIER THIS MORNING THERE WAS ONLY MODEST RISK TO\nTHE UPSIDE HERE AND THE RISK WAS TO THE DOWN SIDE.\nTHE S&P 500 MOVED FOUR POINTS SINCE THE YELLEN SPEECH.\nTHAT WOULD INDICATE THAT THE MARKETS ARE PLEASED SHE IS NOT\nGOING TO DO AN IMMEDIATE RATE HIKE BUT THERE'S VERY LITTLE\nUPSIDE FOR STOCKS. IF YOU LOOK AT BANKS THAT MOVE\nUP ON THE INITIAL HEADLINE THEY HAVE SINCE THEN MOVED TO THE\nDOWN SIDE. THEY'RE NOT ANTICIPATING AN\nIMMEDIATE RATE HIKE. THEY TEND TO MOVE IN OPPOSITE\nDIRECTIONS HERE. UTILITIES MOVED DOWN AND ARE NOW\nESSENTIALLY UP. THAT INDICATES THEY'RE NOT\nBETTING ON A RATE HIKE AS WELL. IT'S NOW DOWN BELOW 13 AGAIN AND\nWE HAVE BEEN EMPHASIZING SEPTEMBER, OCTOBER, NOVEMBER\nWHEN YOU'RE INTO THE ELECTIONS THEY'RE ELEVATED BUT EVEN THEY\nARE DOWN ON A DAILY BASIS. SO THE RISK IS TO THE DOWN SIDE.\nIF YELLEN RELATIONSHIP REALLY APPEARED HAWKISH AND THE MARKET\nBELIEVED THAT STOCKS WOULD REACT VERY NEGATIVELY QUICKLY BUT IF\nSHE DID NOT CLEARLY TIP HER HAT ON SEPTEMBER THERE WOULD ONLY\nHAVE MODEST UPSIDE. WHAT THE MARKET IS PRICING IN\nTHIS YEARFUL. >> DOES THIS MEAN THAT OVERALL\nTHE MARKETS PREPARED FOR RATE HIKES OR THAT IT'S ALWAYS\nTOMORROW AND THEREFORE THE MARKET IS NOT PREPARED?\n>> THE MARKET CAN HANDLE A MODEST RATE HIKE.\nPARTICULARLY WITH THE ECONOMY IMPROVING.\nWE'RE HEARING BETTER NUMBERS. I THINK THE ECONOMY CAN HANDLE A\nRATE HIKE.

YIELDS POPPED HIGHER COMING BACK\nDOWN. THE DOLLAR STRENGTHENED.\nIT'S NOW WEAKER. AND STOCKS ARE BACK NEAR THE\nHIGHS OF THE SESSION. DID WE LEARN ANYTHING NEW FROM\nJANET YELLEN? >> YEAH.\nI THINK WE LEARNED VERY LITTLE IN TERMS OF POLICY.\nYOU KNOW, THIS WAS THE MOST DOVISH/HAWKISH SPEECH WE COULD\nPOSSIBLY HAVE EXPECTED FROM YELLEN AND AS YOU HIGHLIGHT THE\nMARKETS HAVEN'T MOVED. SEEMS LIKE THE MARKETS HAVEN'T\nBOUGHT JANET YELLEN'S INSISTENCE THAT ACTUALLY THE EVIDENCE\nSUPPORTS A RATE HIKE MORE NOW THAN IT DID A COUPLE MONTHS AGO.\nSHE ALSO HIGHLIGHTED THAT IT WOULD ALL BE DATA DEPENDENT,\nTHOUGH, AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE COULD HAVE EXPECTED.\nJANET YELLEN NEVER PAINTS HERSELF INTO A CORNER WHEN SHE\nDOESN'T NEED TO. AND SHE ONCE AGAIN SAID THAT A\nLITTLE BIT OF SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE HERE SUGGESTING THAT\nMAYBE IF DATA CONTINUES TO IMPROVE THERE WILL BE A RATE\nHIKE. BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR AND IT'S NOT\nPREDETERMINED. >> AS I MENTIONED WE'RE SEEING A\nNICE MARKET RALLY WITH THE DOW UP 105 AND THE S&P UP 0.6, IS\nTHAT GOOD ENOUGH TO PACIFY THE MARKETS FROM WHAT WAS A WIDELY\nANTICIPATED POLICY SPEECH HERE? >> YEAH.\nI HAVE TO ADMIT THAT WHEN I WAS COMING INTO THE SPEECH I WAS\nAFRAID THAT 14E68DS SHE WOULD COME ACROSS AS BEING LESS DOVE\nIR THAN IN THE PAST AND WASN'T SURE HOW EQUITIES MIGHT RESPOND.\nIT WAS MORE BECAUSE I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT INTEREST RATE\nSENSITIVE PARTS OF THE EQUITY MARKET LIKE THE DIVIDEND PAYERS\nAND SUCH. I WAS ENKOURLGING PEOPLE TO\nTHINK ABOUT BEING MORE CYCLICAL AS A FORM OF DEFENSE GOING INTO\nTHE SPEECH AND THAT'S WORKED OUT SO FAR.\nHOWEVER, I THINK THAT THERE'S ALSO A HISTORY HERE THAT WE HAVE\nTO LOOK AT WHICH IS THAT OFTEN TIMES YOU GET THIS REACTION IN\nTHE MARKETS THAT'S OFTEN TIMES UNWOUND EITHER BY THE END OF THE\nDAY OR IN SUBSEQUENT TRADING DAYS.\nSO I WOULDN'T GET TOO EMOTIONAL OVER THIS INITIAL REACTION IN\nTHE MARKET. I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO\nKIND OF THING ABOUT THE LONG-TERM HERE.\nSHE'S BASICALLY SAID SHE THINKS THAT EVIDENCE COULD SUPPORT A\nRATE HIKE. IT'S BETTER NOW THAN WHAT IT\nLOOKED LIKE A FEW MONTHS AGO WHICH IS STATING THE OBVIOUS,\nHOWEVER THAT INITIAL REACTION WITH THE 10-YEAR TREASURY TO\n1.59% I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY MORE CORRECT FOR THE LONG TERM\nTHAN THE RETREAT BACK DOWN TO AROUND 1.53 OR WHEREVER WE'RE\nTRADING RIGHT NOW. >> MEGAN, LET'S GET TO THE\nPOINT, I THINK THERE'S A LITTLE UNCERTAINTY OVER HOW THE 10-YEAR\nYIELD MIGHT RESPOND IF IT BELIEVES A SHORT-TERM RATE\nINCREASE IS BECOMING MORE LIKELY.\nWOULD WE EXPECT TO SEE IN A MORE HAWKISH AND LESS DOVISH\nENVIRONMENT OR A COMMENTARY FROM THE FED, WILL THAT 10-YEAR YIELD\nFINALLY BUDGE HIGHER OR ARE WE GOING TO BE IN FOR A TREASURY\nCURVE FLAT SNNG.  >> I EXPECT A FURTHER\nFLATTENING. WHEN THE FED HIKED IN DECEMBER\nWE SAW THE 10-YEAR DROP A LITTLE BIT.\nI DON'T THINK WE'LL SEE A DROP THIS TIME AROUND BUT I DO THINK\nTHAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEE IT INCREASE VERY, VERY SLOWLY.\nMUCH MORE SLOWLY THAN THE SHORT END OF THE YIELD CURVE.\nWE WILL SEE A FLATTENING OF THE YIELD CURVE WHICH EATS INTO BANK\nPROFITS AND DOES PROVIDE A HEADWIND FOR THE ECONOMY.\n>> I'M JUST READING FROM THE SPEECH RIGHT NOW, BRIAN, HERE'S\nA LINE ON THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.\nOF COURSE SHE SAYS, OUR DECISIONS ALWAYS DEPEND ON THE\nDEGREE TO WHICH INCOMING DATA CONTINUES TO CONFIRM THE\nCOMMITTEE'S OUTLOOK. CLEARLY STRESSING THE DATA\nDEPENDENCY. WHAT IF WE GET A POOR JOBS\nREPORT OR STEP BACK IN INFLATION BETWEEN NOW AND DECEMBER.\nDOES THAT MEAN A RATE HIKE IS OFF THE TABLE FOR A YEAR?\n>> WELL, I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR.\nI THINK IT'S CLOSE IF IT WOULD BE FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR IF WE GET\nA BAD REPORT, LET'S SAY THIS UPCOMING WEEK, WE HAVE DATA AS\nFAR AS PCE AND THE EMPLOYMENT SITUATION REPORT.\nIF THOSE ARE BAD YES, I DO THINK THAT RATE HIKE IS OFF FOR THE\nYEAR. HOWEVER, MY EXPECTATION IS THAT\nTHOSE ARE GOING TO BE PRETTY GOOD.\nMY EXPECTATION FOR THE EMPLOYMENT SITUATION REPORT IS\nTHAT WE COULD ACTUALLY HAVE SOMETHING IN EXCESS OF 250,000\nAGAIN. AND THAT I THINK WOULD CREATE\nANOTHER REPRISING OF RATE HIKE EXPECTATIONS WHERE PEOPLE COULD\nBE THINKING WELL, MAYBE SEPTEMBER, NOVEMBER OR DECEMBER\nOR ALL THREE OF THEM ARE BACK ON THE TABLE.\n>> SPEAKING OF INFLATION EXPECTATIONS, MEGAN, I DON'T\nKNOW IF YOU SAW THE JAPANESE CPI NUMBER OVERNIGHT, CORE INFLATION\nIN JULY IN JAPAN, WEAKENING. IT JUST HIGHLIGHTS THE STRUGGLE\nTHAT GLOBAL CENTRAL BANKERS HAVE RIGHT NOW IN PUSHING UP\nINFLATION. IT'S ALSO A REMINDER THAT\nCENTRAL BANKERS AROUND THE WORLD ARE VERY MUCH IN EASING MODE AND\nI WONDER AT A CONFERENCE LIKE THIS WITH KURODA SPEAKING\nTOMORROW HOW THAT COMPLICATES THE PICTURE FOR JANET YELLEN?\n>> IT DOES COMPLICATE THE PICTURE.\nTHE FED CAN ONLY HIKE SO MUCH WHILE EVERY OTHER MAJOR CENTRAL\nBANK IS EASING REALLY AGGRESSIVELY.\nAND I THINK THE BANK OF JAPAN AND PROBABLY THE ECB WILL END UP\nENGAGING IN FULL-ON HELICOPTER MONEY OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.\nSO THAT WILL HAVE IMPLICATION FOR THE U.S. DOLLAR AND,\nTHEREFORE, THE U.S. ECONOMY. ON THE OTHER HAND, INFLATION\nACTUALLY WILL LOOK A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT IN THE U.S. AT THE END\nOF THIS YEAR. OIL PRICES ARE ACTUALLY RISING\nYEAR ON YEAR NOW AND SO I THINK WE WILL SEE INFLATION LOOK\nCLOSER TO THE FED'S TARGET BUT THAT WILL BE BECAUSE OF\nSTATISTICAL REASONS, BASE EFFECTS, NOT BECAUSE OF\nSTRUCTURAL REASONS. WHEN WE GET THE JOBS REPORT NEXT\nWEEK THE HEADLINE FIGURE MIGHT BE GREAT.\nI TEND TO IGNORE THE HEADLINE FIGURE AND LOOK AT WAGE DATA\nINSTEAD. THAT SUGGESTS WHAT'S GOING ON IN\nTERMS OF STRUCTURAL PRESSURES OF INFLATION AND THERE I DON'T\nTHINK WE'LL SEE ANY CHANGE. WE MIGHT GET BETTER INFLATION\nDATA AT THE END OF THIS YEAR. THE HAWKS ON THE FOMC MIGHT GET\nREALLY EXCITED ABOUT THAT, BUT IT WON'T BE SUSTAINED AND THAT'S\nWORTH KEEPING IN MIND. >> ALL RIGHT.\nGUYS, GOOD DISCUSSION. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US AFTER\nTHE YELLEN SPEECH. MEGAN GREEN, BRIAN JACOBSON,\nTHANK YOU VERY MUCH.

I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, THE\nKNEE-JERK REACTION ISN'T WHERE THE ACTION IS AT.\nSEE IF THEY BELIEVE THE WORDS AND AS THE CONFERENCE GOES ON\nAND SHE GETS UP AT THE PODIUM BECAUSE I WILL TELL YOU, DOESN'T\nHOLD WATER IN STRENGTHENING. WE COULD HAVE SAID THIS IN Q2\nAND Q3 OF 2014. Q3 WE HAD 5% GDP.\nWHAT DOES RECENTLY MEAN? WE HAD BETTER EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS\nBUT THEY'RE CHOPPY. YOU GOT TO TAKE LONGER TERM\nVIEW, JANET YELLEN, AND COMPANY, BUT THE MARKET IS ACTING PREDICT\nLITTLE BIT OFF THE HEADLINES SEEN JUST FAR.\n>> ON THAT NOTE, NO TIMETABLE IT LOOKS LIKE IN THE SPEECH AS\nWELL. RICK SANTELLI THANK YOU.\nLET'S GET THE STOCK REACTION. BOB PISANI ON THE FLOOR, WHAT DO\nYOU SEE? >> WELL, CASE FOR RATE HIKE HAS\nSTRENGTHENED IN RECENT MONTHS. THAT'S MODESTLY AGGRESSIVE.\nBUT DOESN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION WHETHER SEPTEMBER IS ON THE\nTABLE. YOU CAN SEE THAT IN THE REACTION\nTO THE MARKETS. LET'S LOOK AT THE S&P.\n2178. THAT'S WHERE WE WERE GOING IN,\n2179 WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW. THAT'S A PRETTY MODEST REACTION\nI WOULD SAY THAT'S STATISTICALLY NOT TERRIBLY IMPORTANT.\nLOOK AT THE BANKS, BANKS WILL MOVE ON ANY KIND OF POTENTIAL\nHINT OF A RATE INCREASE. YOU SAW A MODEST RATE FROM 33 TO\n33.60. THEY'RE PRICING IN A HIGHER\nPROBABILITY DOWN THE ROAD OF SOME KIND OF RATE HIKE.\nAGAIN, STILL DOESN'T MEAN SEPTEMBER.\nTAKE A LOOK AT ANOTHER INTEREST RATE SENSITIVE VEHICLE UTILITIES\nWHICH WILL MOVE DOWN WHEN YOU HAVE TALK OF RATE HIKES.\nYOU SEE THE 253 WHERE WE WERE AT, 254 AND THAT'S MOVED DOWN\nABOUT A POINT. THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT\nTHEY'RE STRGTS TO PRICE IN RATE HIKE.\nDOWN THE ROAD. IT IT YOU LOOK AT THE VIX,\nTRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE VOLATILITY IS, 1346 WHERE WE\nWERE. VOLATILITY IS DOWN A LITTLE BIT.\nWHAT THIS IS SAYING IS THAT SHORT TERM THE MARKET IS NOT\nANTICIPATING VOLATILITY, A LOT MORE VOLATILITY, IN THE NEXT 30\nDAYS. HOWEVER AS WE KEEP POINTING OUT\nIT'S NOT ABOUT NOW, IT'S ABOUT LOOKING OUT WELL INTO OCTOBER\nAND NOVEMBER AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE VIX FUTURES SEE IF THEY\nMOVED UP, WE WERE AT 17, THESE ARE MODEST MOVES HERE.\nEVEN TO THE DOWNSIDE FOR THE DAY HERE.\nBUT YOU CAN SEE IN OCTOBER, AND NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER, THEY ARE\nHIGHER THAN WHERE THEY ARE RIGHT NOW BUT EVEN HERE RIGHT NOW IN\nREACTION TO THE FED ANNOUNCEMENT THERE'S NOT SIGNIFICANT MOVES TO\nTHE UPSIDE. THEY'RE DOWN SLIGHTLY RIGHT NOW.\nSO THE BOTTOM LINE, ECONOMY IS CLEARLY DOING BETTER.\nSHE HAS CLEARLY SIGNALED THE POTENTIAL THAT EVERY MEETING IS\nSTILL LIVE. SHE DID NOT SAY THAT BUT THAT'S\nCLEARLY THE IMPLICATION. NOT ENOUGH OF THE CLEAR TIP OF\nTHE HAT THAT SEPTEMBER IS TRULY ON THE TABLE.\nI THINK SIGNIFICANTLY TO SWAY THE MARKETS.\nBACK TO YOU. >> WE WILL WATCH THAT.\nBOB, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BOB PISANI.\nSTAY WITH THE COMMENTS FROM YELLEN.\nJOINING US ON CNBC FREDERICK MISHKIN, FORMER FEDERAL RESERVE\nGOVERNOR COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY ECONOMICS PROFESSOR.\nGREAT TO HAVE YOU BACK. THANKS FOR JOINING US.\n>> MY PLEASURE. >> I'M CURIOUS, WHAT DO YOU SEE\nTHAT'S PARTICULARLY NEW HERE? >> I DON'T SEE ANYTHING THAT'S\nREALLY THAT NEW. THAT IS REALLY KEEPING THEIR\nOPTIONS OPEN. THE WAY I THINK ABOUT WHAT\nTHEY'RE DOING IS THEY'RE VERY MUCH DATA DEPENDENT AND THAT\nTHEY REALLY WANT TO REACT TO HOW THE DATA COMES IN AND IF THE\nDATA SAYS THAT THE ECONOMY IS STRONG AND THE INFLATION, THEY\nHAVE CONFIDENCE IN INFLATION [ INAUDIBLE ] THEN THEY'LL GO.\nAND THE OTHER HAND IF THE DATA DOESN'T COME IN AS STRONG THEY\nWON'T RAISE RATES AND [ INAUDIBLE ] SO IT'S POSSIBLY\nTHEY LOWER RATES BACK DOWN AGAIN.\nI DON'T THINK THAT'S [ INAUDIBLE ].\nBUT IT'S AN OPTION. [ INAUDIBLE ].\n>> WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON THIS. FREDERICK, WE'RE GOING TO WORK\nON THE SKYPE CONNECTION IN A MOMENT AND HOPE TO TALK TO YOU\nIN A COUPLE MINUTES. ON THAT NOTE, THOUGH, I THINK\nPEOPLE ARE SORT OF WARMING TO THIS IDEA THAT IT'S NOT\nGROUNDBREAKING SPEECH BUT PUTS THE ONUS NOW ON DATA THAT WE'RE\nABOUT TO SEE. THIS PUTS THE JOBS NUMBER IN\nSHARP RELIEF THAT WE'RE ABOUT TO GET.\n>> REMINDING THE MARKET THAT A RATE HIKE IS COMING AND YOU'RE\nSEEING THAT REACTION SLIGHTLY IN THE BOND MARKET.\nTHE TWO-YEAR YIELD THE HIGHEST SINCE JUNE, THE 10 YEAR OUT OF\n160. THESE AREN'T INCREDIBLY DRAMATIC\nMOVES BUT A REACTION THERE. >> COMPARED TO AUGUST, IT FEELS\nDRAMATIC. >> AND STOCKS ARE HOLDING THEIR\nGAINS HERE. THE DOLLAR FLIPPED INTO POSITIVE\nTERRITORY WITH THOSE HIGHER YIELDS.\nAND FINANCIALS STAY ON TOP OF THE HEAT.\nYOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A RATE HIKE IS COMING TRADE, BUT SHE\nDIDN'T GIVE A TIME FRAME AND CONTINUED TO SAY THAT WE WERE\nDATA DEPENDENT AND THE BULK OF THE SPEECH FOCUSES ON WHAT TO DO\nIF THE ECONOMY STARTS TO WEAKEN AGAIN.\n>> IFS THIS DOESN'T WORK HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY.\n>> EXACTLY. >> DEFINITELY SNUGS UP THE\nEXPECTATIONS THAT THE THRESHOLD FOR THEM MOVING IS LOWER\nSLIGHTLY. SEPTEMBER IS STILL THEORETICALLY\nA LIVE MEETING. BUT IT DOES NOT SARA, AS YOU SAY\nRADICALLY CHANGE THE PERCEIVED TIMETABLE AND I DO THINK THAT\nBASICALLY THE MARKET -- IT'S KIND OF AS WE THOUGHT, ECHOS\nWHAT BILL DUDLEY HAS BEEN SAYING ROUGHLY, PROBABLY SOMEWHAT LIKE\nWHAT STAN FISHER HAS RECENTLY SPOKEN ABOUT AS WELL.\n>> I WOULD JUST WONDER, HOW SENSITIVE AND VULNERABLE THIS\nMARKET IS GOING TO BE, TO ANY INTEREST RATE SHOCK OR TO ANY\nINTEREST RATE HIKE IF IT COMES IN SEPTEMBER OR DECEMBER.\nBECAUSE AS OF NOW, AND AS OF BEFORE JANET YELLEN'S SPEECH, WE\nWERE ONLY PRICING IF IN, THE BOND MARKET, A LITTLE MORE THAN\n50% CHANCE IT HAPPENED. WE GOT THE LATEST FUND FLOW DATA\nFROM BANK OF AMERICA AND MERRILL LYNCH, 6 MILLION MORE FUNDS\nFLOWED INTO BOND FUNDS AND OUTFLOWS OUT OF EQUITY FUNDS.\nTHE LOWER FOR LONGER TRADE CONTINUES TO PERSIST IN THE\nMARKETS AND WONDER HOW THAT SETS US UP IN CASE THE FED DOES MOVE.\n>> THE BOND MARKET PROBABLY, YOU KNOW, IF IT HAD FEELINGS WOULD\nFEEL THAT IT'S BEEN BURNED A COUPLE OF TIMES WHEN IT HAS OVER\nANTICIPATED A FED MOVE, RIGHT. FIRST WITH THE TAPER TANTRUM AND\nTHEN THINK BACK TO THE SPRING, THE FED SEEMED VERY INTENT ON\nJUST LIFTING THE MARKET'S PROBABILITIES FOR A MOVE IN THE\nSUMMER. BUT REALLY MAYBE WASN'T\nINTENDING TO DO ANYTHING IN THE SUMMER.\nWANTED TO KNOCK THE MARKET BACK ON ITS HEELS A LITTLE BIT AND I\nTHINK THE BOND MARKET IS LIKE WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO ALONG WITH\nTHAT YET. >> IF THE BOND MARKET HAD\nFEELINGS IT WOULD BE RICK SANTELLI.\n>> I THINK RICK HAS FEELINGS. >> I'M SAYING HE IS THE --\n>> HE WOULD CHANNEL THE FEELINGS PERHAPS.\n>> GOOD TO GET STAN FISHER TO REACT TO THIS SPEECH AND LET US\nKNOW HOW CLOSE THE FED IS TO RAISING INTEREST RATES.\nALSO KURODA SPEAKS TOMORROW. THAT SHOULD BE SOME INTERESTING\nHEADLINES. I THINK WE HAVE FRED MISHKIN TO\nRESPOND AS WELL. >> ARE YOU THERE?\n>> I AM. >> RECAP WHAT YOU WERE SAYING.\nBIG TAKEAWAY AS FAR AS YELLEN SAYING THAT ECONOMY IS\nSTRENGTHENING AND A RATE HIKE COMING BUT NOT GIVING CLUES AS\nTO WHEN. >> SO I THINK THAT THE FED HAS\nHAD A BIG PROBLEM IN TERMS OF ADVERTISING FUTURE RATE\nINCREASES AND THEN FREQUENTLY FINDING THE DATA IS NOT\nSUFFICIENTLY STRONG AND BACKING OFF AND THAT HURTS THE FED'S\nCREDIBILITY. I THINK IT'S BAD WAY FOR THEM TO\nCOMMUNICATE. SO WHAT JANET HAS DONE HERE IS\nDESCRIBING THE DATA, SHE IS GIVING YOU AN INDICATION OF THE\nFACT THAT THE ECONOMY IS LOOKING BETTER WHICH MAKES RATE HIKES\nMORE LIKELY, HOWEVER, THERE'S NO COMMITMENT.\nAND I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY THE RIGHT THING FOR HER TO DO.\nTHE KEY WAY OF THINKING ABOUT THIS IS THAT INSTEAD OF MAKING\nTIME COMMITMENTS SAYING WE'RE GOING TO RAISE X NUMBER OF TIMES\nOR CERTAIN MEETINGS, IT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO MAKE COMMITMENTS\nABOUT WHAT THE DATA IS GOING TO TELL YOU AND THEN HOW YOU'LL\nREACT TO THE DATA. AND AS WE'VE SEEN THE DATA HAS\nBEEN BETTER LATELY BUT, YOU KNOW, IT CAN GO EITHER WAY.\nREMEMBER WE HAD THE TERRIBLE JOBS REPORT IN MAY AND THEN IT\nCAME BACK VERY STRONG IN JUNE AND JULY.\nSO THE ISSUE IS, HOW STRONG IS THE DATA?\nTHE DATA IS STRONG WE'RE READY TO GO AND IF THE DATA IS NOT\nSTRONG WE'RE NOT READY TO GO. >> SO IN YOUR VIEW, IS THE\nMARKET UNDER PRICING THE RISK THAT THE FED RAISE RATES IN\nSEPTEMBER? >> WELL, I FELT ACTUALLY THAT\nTHE MARKET DID UNDER PRICE A LITTLE BIT, ALTHOUGH I THINK\nTHIS IS REALLY MAKING IT MUCH MORE LIKELY THERE WILL BE A\nNOVEMBER MOVE AND THAT -- IN FACT, I DID THINK THAT THE\nMARKET UNDERPRICED THAT. I DO THINK THE SITUATION IS MORE\nFAVORABLE TO THEM RAISING RATES. IF IT WERE ME I WOULD NOT RAISE\nRATES RIGHT NOW FOR REASONS THAT I DON'T THINK THAT THE INFLATION\nRATE IS MOVING SUFFICIENTLY IN THE DIRECTION WE NEED TO SEE IT\nMOVE, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THAT'S A JUDGMENT CALL.\n>> DO YOU ASSIGN ANY SIGNIFICANCE TO THE FACT THAT\nJANET YELLEN DID NOT SAY THAT THEY'RE ACTIVELY CONSIDERING ANY\nOF THESE NEW TOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED, FOR EXAMPLE,\nRAISING THE STATED INFLATION TARGET OR IS THAT PRETTY MUCH AS\nEXPECTED. >> YEAH.\nTHAT'S AS EXPECTED. TALKING ABOUT DOING ANYTHING IN\nTERMS OF RAISING INFLATION TARGETS AND SO FORTH, WOULD BE A\nVERY LONG DISCUSSION FOR FEDERAL RESERVE.\nMY VIEW IS THAT I WOULD ACTUALLY ADVOCATE THAT THE FEDERAL\nRESERVE TEMPORARILY SHOOT FOR A HIGHER THAN 2% TARGET.\nWHY? BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN UNDER\nSHOOTING SO MUCH. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, THAT KIND\nOF DISCUSSION IS ONE THAT THEY WOULD TAKE A LONG TIME TO DO,\nTHE FED IS VERY CONSERVATIVE ABOUT CHANGING THEIR OVERALL\nSTRATEGY, YOU CAN SEE THIS, TEFLDS HAVE COMMUNICATION --\nTHEY WOULD HAVE COMMUNICATION COMMITTEES AND 18 MONTHS LATER\nCOME UP WITH SOMETHING AND CERTAINLY CHANGING THE INFLATION\nTARGET WOULD BE A HUGE, HUGE MOVE FOR THEM.\nAND WOULD NOT BE DONE LIGHTLY. >> AND YOU KNOW, OF COURSE, THE\nREJOINEDER TO THAT IDEA IS THAT THE FED IS HAVING TROUBLE\nMEETING ITS CURRENT INFLATION TARGET WHY WOULD LIFTING THE\nTARGET SOMEHOW MAKE IT MORE ACHIEVABLE OR FAVORABLE AS AN\nOUTCOME? >> IT WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH\nINDICATING THE FED SHOULD BE RAISING RATES SLOWER THAN IT\nOTHERWISE WOULD. EVEN TO THE EXIT ENT THAT IT'S\nDIFFICULT TO GET INFLATION UP AND, IN FACT, I CONSIDER THAT\nTHE BIGGEST PROBLEM FOR CENTRAL BANKERS RIGHT NOW, IS THAT WE'RE\nIN A WORLD WHERE GETTING INFLATION HIGH ENOUGH IS\nDIFFICULT TO DO. BUT EVEN IF THAT'S TRUE, IT'S\nSTILL TRUE IF YOU COMMIT TO AIMING FOR A HIGHER INFLATION\nRATE THAN 2%, I WOULD THINK TEMPORARILY WOULD BE A\nREASONABLE THING TO DO, THEN IN THAT CASE YOU'RE ALSO\nCOMMITTING, ALSO INDICATING YOU'RE NOT GOING TO REACT AS\nQUICKLY TO DATA COMING IN AS STRONG.\nIN FACT, WHAT YOU WILL DO IS TEND TO KEEP RATES LOW AND I\nTHINK THAT'S CERTAINLY AN APPROPRIATE THING FOR THEM TO\nDO. AS I SAY, I THINK THAT THEM\nCHANGING THE BASIC COMMUNICATION STRATEGY SINCE 2012, IS\nSOMETHING THAT WOULD BE -- TAKE A LONG TIME, VERY BIG DISCUSSION\nAND WILL NOT OCCUR IN THE NEAR FUTURE.\n>> THAT SAID, BULLARD THIS MORNING, FREDERICK, SAID HE\nTHOUGHT THEY HAD HURT THEIR CREDIBILITY WITH SO-CALLED BAD\nGUIDANCE. HE SAID HE WOULD CONSIDER\nBANNING THE WORD STIMULUS BECAUSE IT'S CONDITIONED THE\nMARKET TO THINK ABOUT WHAT'S COMING IN THE NEXT QUARTER OR\nTWO. ARE YOU THAT HARSH A CRITIC?\n>> NO. BUT I AM A CRITIC OF THE FACT\nI'VE BEEN QUITE A BIG CRITIC OF THE NATURE OF THE FORWARD\nGUIDANCE THEY'VE BEEN DOING, THAT I WOULD -- A MEMBER OF A\nTEAM THAT WROTE A PAPER FOR THE U.S. MONETARY POLICY FORUM IN\nFEBRUARY WHICH WAS VERY CRITICAL OF THE FED USING FORWARD\nGUIDANCE IN TERMS OF DATES. WHAT I DON'T THINK IS HELPFUL\nWHEN THEY SAY WE'RE GOING TO RAISE RATES TWICE DURING THE\nYEAR OR FOUR TIMES DURING THE YEAR WHATEVER, I THINK THAT THIS\nHAS BEEN VERY DAMAGING AND SERIOUSLY HURT THE CREDIBILITY\nAND, IN FACT, THE MARKET'S VIEW OF FED COMMUNICATION STRATEGY\nRIGHT NOW IS THAT IT'S VERY WEAK.\nSO IN THAT SENSE I AGREE WITH BULLARD BUT ON THE OTHER HAND,\nTHE FED SHOULD DESCRIBE WHAT DATA THEY THINK IS GOING TO COME\nIN, WHAT THEIR FORECASTS ARE, BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, THEN HOW\nTHEY WILL REACT TO IT. SO I THINK THAT'S COMPLETELY\nFINE THING TO DO. WHITE NOT HURT THE CREDIBILITY.\nIT WOULD GIVE INFORMATION TO THE MARKET THAT THE MARKETS NEED AND\nWOULD ACTUALLY PRODUCE MUCH BETTER MONETARY POLICY.\nBUT I THINK THAT IT'S ABSOLUTELY CORRECT THAT FED SHOULD STOP,\nCEASE CEASE AND DESIST FROM GIVING CALENDAR RATES WHEN THEY\nMIGHT RAISE RATES. >> FINALLY FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO\nARGUE THAT DAY IS NOW OVER, BECAUSE WE HAVE THE SPEECH, HOW\nIMPORTANT IS WHATEVER CLEANUP FISHER BETS IN A FEW HOURS?\n>> I DON'T KNOW. THAT'S SOMETHING I CAN'T\nSPECULATE ON. I THINK THAT CERTAINLY THAT THE\nVICE CHAIR IS IN NO WAY GOING TO CONTRADICT WHATEVER THE\nCHAIRPERSON HAS SAID. AND SO THAT I THINK HE WILL BE\nTHERE TO HELP CLARIFY BUT I DON'T THINK THERE WILL BE MUCH\nCLEANUP HERE. PUSHED TO GIVE MORE SPECIFIC\nINFORMATION AS TO WHAT THE SPEECH, JANET'S SPEECH MEANS IN\nTERMS OF THE FUTURE FED ACTIONS BUT I THINK THAT HE'S NOT GOING\nTO CHANGE THE VIEW THE SPEECH WAS INTENDED TO GIVE.\n>> WE ARE EAGER TO HEAR FROM HIM IN A LITTLE OVER AN HOUR.\nFRED, THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH USP.\n>> MY PLEASURE. SORRY ABOUT THE SKYPE.\n>> IT'S FINE.

SO SHE WILL TRY TO STRADDLE BOTH\nTHE HAWKISH AND DOVISH APPROACHES, LEAVE THAT OPTION\nOPEN FOR A HIKE. I DO NOT EXPECT HER TO BE\nHAWKISH. I DON'T THINK SHE WILL BE AS\nHAWKISH AS STAN FISHER, KAPLAN OR GEORGE.\nTHOSE PEOPLE ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SPECTRUM THAN\nYELLEN, BUT SHE'LL WANT TO LEAVE HER OPTIONALITY OPEN TO GO.\n>> AND KATE, HOW WOULD THE MARKET REACT TO SUCH A THING\nGIVEN THERE'S SO MUCH HYPE AND ATTENTION AND SEEMS LIKE\nINVESTORS ARE CRAVING A CATALYST RIGHT NOW NO.\n>> I DO THINK INVESTORS ARE LOOKING FOR A CATALYST.\nI DON'T THINK SHE'LL PROVIDE IT. THAT COULD LEAD TO A LITTLE\nDISAPPOINTMENT BUT PROBABLY TO THE A LOT.\nI THINK THAT JANET YELLEN IS COMFORTABLE WITH WHERE THE\nMARKET CURRENTLY EXPECTS THE INTEREST RATE HIKES TO COME, NOT\nSO MUCH IN SEPTEMBER, A LITTLE MORE IN DECEMBER, MAYBE IN 2017.\nAND IF SHE LEAVES IT THERE EVERYONE WANTS MORE CERTAINTY\nAND ALSO NOT MUCH CHANGE THAT SUGGESTS NOT MUCH MARKET\nREACTION. >> GEE, JUST TO THAT POINT, DOES\nJANET YELLEN NEED TO MAKE THE CASE MORE TO THE PEOPLE WHO SAY\nLET'S GET ON WITH IT OR TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO SAY, THE CONDITIONS\nHAVEN'T CHANGED VERY MUCH, THE ECONOMY IS NOT RUNNING AWAY FOR\nUS LET'S WAIT? WHICH WAY DOES SHE HAVE TO MAKE\nHER ARGUMENT? >> MIKE, SHE'LL, I THINK ERR ON\nTHE SIDE OF THE LATTER. THAT'S BEEN HER PATTERN.\nTHE HAWKS HAVE BEEN VALENTLY TRYING TO GET THE FED TO MOVE\nFOR A LONG TIME NOW. THEY'VE CLEARLY BEEN IN THE\nLOSING POSITION. I DON'T THINK THE ECONOMY IS\nPARTICULARLY ROBUST. WE HAD GROWTH IN THE FIRST HALF\nOF THE YEAR AVERAGING ONLY AROUND 1%.\nTHIS QUARTER GROWTH MAY BE BETTER.\nTHAT'S THE RISK. BUT I DON'T THINK THIS ECONOMY\nIS GETTING AWAY FROM US. I THINK THE FED SHOULD HAVE\nRAISED RATES A LONG TIME AGO. THEY MISSED THEIR WINDOW.\nI DON'T SEE THEM GETTING RATES VERY MUCH HIGHER AND MY GUESS\nIS, AGAIN, SHE'LL ERR ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION AND SHE'S THE\nONE CONTROLLING THE COMMITTEE. >> BOTTOM LINE, KATE, WE'RE\nPARSING THE LANGUAGE AND HINTS AND CLUES AND SHORT-TERM VISION\nAND LONG-TERM VISION. WHAT IS THE INVESTMENT CLIMATE\nLOOK LIKE FOR YOU FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR RIGHT NOW, GIVEN WE\nCONTINUE TO SEE A REBOUND BROADLY IN THE U.S. ECONOMY.\nIT'S NOT PERFECT. BUT IT DOES CONTINUE TO TAKE\nSHAPE AND THE MARKET IS NOW AT A RECORD HIGH?\nWHAT DO YOU DO FROM HERE? >> WE THINK WE'RE HE LIKELY TO\nCONTINUE TO SEE MODEST GAINS IN STOCKS SUPPORTED BY THE MODEST\nECONOMIC GROWTH AND THE ECONOMY SHOULD BE A LITTLE STRONGER IN\nTHE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR. I THINK WE'RE SEEING THAT IN THE\nDATA AND FROM COMPANIES TALKING ABOUT HOW THEIR BUSINESS LOOKS A\nLITTLE BIT BETTER. SO WE THINK WHAT YOU WANT TO OWN\nARE COMPANIES THAT HAVE DIVERSIFIED BUSINESSES, THAT PAY\nDIVIDENDS BUT NOT HIGH YIELDERS. WE ARE SEEING THE ROTATION AWAY\nFROM THOSE. AND HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR\nDIVIDEND GROWTH. THE REASON IS THESE ARE\nCOMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GROW THEIR EARNINGS EVEN IN\nREALLY TOUGH ENVIRONMENTS. WE THINK THE ENVIRONMENT IS\nTOUGH BUT STILL A GOOD ENVIRONMENT FOR INVESTORS\nESPECIALLY IN STOCKS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO GROW OVER TIME\nDUE TO THEIR DIVERSIFIED BUSINESSES.\n>> DOES THAT INCLUDE FINANCIALS? WHERE DO THEY FIT IN YOUR THESIS\nOVERALL? >> I DO THINK THAT THE\nFINANCIALS CAN GROW. I THINK THEY'RE CONTINUING TO\nSTRUGGLE WITH THE LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRMS AND CERTAINLY WITH\nTHE FLATTENING YIELD CURVE. THE FLATTER THE YIELD CURVE IS\nTHE HARDER IT IS FOR THEM TO SHOW EARNINGS GROWTH.\nI THINK THEY MANAGED THROUGH IT PRETTY WELL NOW, BUT CERTAINLY\nANYTHING THAT RAISE INTEREST RATES WOULD BE GOOD NEWS FOR THE\nFINANCIALS. THE CONTINUAL EXPECTATION THAT\nWE'LL SEE ONE MORE RATE HIKE IS GOOD NEWS FOR FINANCIALS.\nI WOULD BE ADDING THEM. BUT I THINK THEY'RE BETTER\nOPPORTUNITIES IN OTHER SECTORS RIGHT NOW.\n>> JOE, IT SEEMS AS IF THE TREASURY MARKET IS REALLY GOING\nTO WANT TO SEE, YOU KNOW, THE WHITES OF THE FED'S EYES WHEN IT\nCOMES TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY LIFT THE SHORT INTEREST RATE UP\nHERE BEFORE MOVING. DOES THE 10-YEAR YIELD HAVE TO\nGO UP A LITTLE BIT IN ANTICIPATION OF THE RATE HIKE?\nDOES VICTIM TO STEEPP BEFORE THE FED FEELS COMFORTABLE MAKING A\nMOVE EVEN IF IN DECEMBER. >> THE FED JUST LOOKS AT FED\nFUNDS FUTURE AND THEIR RECORD IS WOEFUL UNLESS THE MARKET HAS\nPRICED A HIGH PROBABILITY OF THE FED MOVING AT THAT MEETING\nSOMEWHERE CLOSE TO 70%, THE FED DOES NOT BUCK THE MARKET TREND.\nAND WHAT THE TREASURE MARKET IS TELLING US NOW, AND THIS IS TRUE\nGLOBALLY AND YES, PART OF IT IS BECAUSE OF ZERO AND NEGATIVE\nRATE AND THE QUANTITATIVE EASING, WHAT WE'RE SEEING\nGLOBALLY ARE FLAT YIELD CURVES, RATES REMAINING DEPRESSED AT THE\nLONG END, SEEING INFLATION EXPECTATIONS REMAIN LOW.\nTHIS IS JUST NOT A GLOBAL ECONOMY AND A GLOBAL FINANCIAL\nMARKETPLACE TELLING US INFLATION PRESSURE IS A PROBLEM AND THAT\nFED CAN GET VERY FAR ALONG ON THESE RATE HIKES.\nIT WOULD BE INTERESTING IF YELLEN BACKS AWAY FROM THEIR\nFORECAST OF THE TERMINAL RATE WHICH IS STILL VERY HIGH.\n>> THERE'S A LOOK AT FISHER AND YELLEN MAKING THEIR WAY INTO --\n>> THIS IS THE FAMOUS WALK. >> THE WALK.\n>> WE'VE BEEN WAITING ALL YEAR LONG.\n>> EVERYTHING SHORT OF THE BRIEFCASE.\n>> THIS IS THE PATIO, RIGHT OUTSIDE OF THE CONFERENCE ROOM\nWHERE THEY ACTUALLY HOLD THE MEETINGS WHICH ARE CLOSED DOOR\nTO THE PRESS AND WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY GOING TO GET HER -- TO\nSEE HER DELIVER THAT MEETING. WE SEE HER WALK INTO THE ROOM.\nTHERE SHE IS WITH HER TWO LIEUTENANTS LOOKING CHEERFUL I\nWOULD SAY. >> THEY STOP FOR THE RED CARPET\nPHOTOS. >> THE CASUAL LOOK, BE THAT'S\nGENERALLY HOW THE DRESS CODE GOES AT JACKSON HOLE.\n>> OH, YEAH. ALL FLEECES AND FISHING WEAR\nAND -- >> YEAH.\nA LOT OF DISCUSSION. >> HOODIES.\n>> FINALLY, JOE, I WONDER, WHETHER YOU EXPECT ANYTHING\nSUBSTANTIVE ON THIS IDEA OF A LOWER NEUTRAL RATE AND WHETHER\nOR NOT THAT IS AN EVENTUAL CONSTRAINT ON NORMALIZATION?\n>> OH, AS CARL, CERTAINLY IT'S AN EVENTFUL RESTRAINT ON THE FED\nAND WE'VE WRITTEN ABOUT THIS. I MEAN THE TERMINAL GROWTH RATE\nTHE POTENTIAL GROWTH RATE IN THE ECONOMY IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER.\nMUCH OF THE WORK LARRY SUMMERS I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S EXACTLY RIGHT\nBUT CERTAINLY FELT RIGHT FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS.\nI DON'T SEE THE FED BEING ABLE TO MOVE VERY FAR.\nTHE PROBLEM IS THE FED HAS GOT THESE DOTS AND THIS TRANSPARENCY\nAND SAYING THEIR TERMINAL RATE IS AROUND 3.\nTHE MARKET IS SAYING IT'S AROUND 1.\nTHE FED STILL HAS A MAJOR COMMUNICATION PROBLEM AND I\nWOULD ARGUE THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF CREDIBILITY WITH THE\nMARKETS. >> I'M LOVING THIS SHOT OF THE\nTHREE MOST POWERFUL CENTRAL BANKERS IN THIS COUNTRY JUST\nENJOYING THE VIEW. >> IT IS A GORGEOUS SHOT.\nI THINK IT WAS [ INAUDIBLE ] THAT TWEETED THAT SHOT OF THE\nTETONS AND SAID AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL.\nJUST AN AMAZING -- >> CAN WE READ ANYTHING INTO\nTHEIR BODY LANGUAGE ABOUT WHAT SHE'S GOING TO SAY AND HINT.\n>> RED, WHITE AND BLUE. >> IS DUDLEY IN BLACK?\n>> THANKS SO MUCH.

THERE IS A SYSTEM.\nI LAID OUT THERE ARE FOUR OR FIVE HANDS THAT THE PRODUCT\nTOUCHES AND COMPANIES THAT IT GOES THROUGH BEFORE IT EVER GETS\nTO THAT PATIENT AT THE COUNTER. NO ONE -- EVERYBODY SHOULD BE\nFRUSTRATED. I AM HOPING THAT THIS IS AN\nINFLECTION POINT FOR THIS COUNTRY.\nOUR HEALTH CARE IS IN A CRISIS. IT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN THE\nMORTGAGE FINANCIAL CRISIS BACK IN 2007.\n>> MEG TEREL JOINS US NOW. >> WHAT MYLAN CEO DID YESTERDAY\nWAS BRING A FIGHT. IT USUALLY TAKES PLACE BEHIND\nCLOSED DOORS. THIS REALLY AFFECTED THE STOCKS\nOF THE REST OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN YESTERDAY.\nTHE PHARMACEUTICAL CARE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION T TRADE\nGROUP FOR PHARMACY BENEFITS MANAGERS CAME OUT WITH A\nSTATEMENT RESPONDING YESTERDAY AFTERNOON LOOP LG MYLAN AND\nSAYING THAT MYLAN IS SIMPLY THE LATEST DRUG MAKER TRYING TO\nREFRAME THE PRICING PROBLEM INTO A COVERAGE PROBLEM.\nBLAMING PAYERS FOR THE MASSIVE PRICE INCREASES IS A RED HERRING\nAND DOESN'T PASS THE LAB TEST. WE ALSO TALKED WITH A CHIEF\nMILLION DR. DR. WHO ISSUED A CHANNEL TO MYLAN.\n>> WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE LOWER DRUG PRICES.\nWE PASS THE SAVINGS WE TAKE FROM THE MARKETPLACE BACK TO OUR\nPLANS. I CHALLENGE HER, SHE CAN LOWER\nTHE PRICE TODAY AND WE'LL MAKE SURE OUR PATIENTS GET LOWER\nCO-PAYS AND OUR PLANS PAY LOWER PRICES.\n>> BECAUSE OF COURSE HEATHER BRESCH WAS MAKING THE ARGUMENT\nTHAT THE SYSTEM INCENTIVIZES HIGHER PRICES ON BRANDED DRUGS.\n>> IS THAT TRUE. YOU THINK ANT THE MARGIN OF ALL\nTHE OTHER PLAYERS. THE GRAPHIC.\nTHE FIVE DIFFERENT HAND IF YOU WILL THAT TOUCH THIS.\nTHAT'S EFFECTIVELY 50% OF THE PRICE OF THIS DRUG IF NOT MORE.\n>> MORE. >> HOW DO YOU FIX THAT COMPONENT\nOF IT. SHE SHOULD BE REDUCING THE PRICE\nTOO. >> YOUR QUESTION ASSUMES THAT\nTHIS IS ACCURATE. THE ENTRY IS NOW PUSHING BACK ON\nTHIS. WE HAVE A NOTE OUT THIS MORNING\nWHO COVERS THE DISTRIBUTORS AND THE PBMs AND HE'S SAYING THIS IS\nAN OVERSIMPLIFICATION. WHAT HE SAY IS THE SUPPLY CHAIN\nIS NOT EARNING MORE THAN HALF OF THE MIC PROFITS HERE.\nNOT EVEN CLOSE. THERE'S AN ARGUMENT THAT THIS\nWASN'T CORRECT. >> AS THE PRICE GOES UP AND SHE\nTAKES MARGIN. ARE THEY TAKING MARGIN TOO?\nIS THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING? WE DON'T KNOW KNOW, BUT THE\nASSUMPTION IS YES. THE PBMs ARE PUSHING BACK ON\nTHAT. THE ARGUMENT OF THE DRUG\nINDUSTRY IS THAT THE PBMs MAKE MONEY BY NEGOTIATING BIGGER\nDISCOUNTS ON DRUGS. >> THIS IS ALL AN ABSURD\nDISCUSSION BECAUSE BOTH TYPES OF COMPANIES SHOULD TRYING TO\nMAXIMIZE PROFITS. WHAT SHOULD BE STOPPING IS\nCOMPETITION. >> SO WHEN THE P BM POINTS AND\nSAYS NO, NO, YOU'RE THE ONE TRYING TO MAXIMIZE PROFITS.\nAND HEATHER SAYS NO, NO, IT'S THEM.\nBOTH OF THEM SHOULD BE TRYING TO MAKE MORE MONEY.\n>> THERE'S A LOT MORE COMPETITION I'M JUST TRYING TO\nUNDERSTAND. >> OTHERWISE YOUR LEFT WITH\nTRYING TO DECIDE WHAT'S A FAIR MARGIN.\nYES, THEY'RE TRYING TO BOOST MARGINS.\n>> I WAS GOING TO GO TO A SEPARATE QUESTION.\nONE OF THE THINGS SHE TALKED ABOUT IS THE FACT SHE GIVES AWAY\nEPIPENS TO SCHOOLS FOR FREE. THIS WAS PART OF THE QUESTION\nABOUT THE LOBBYING THAT'S GOING ON.\nI ASSUME THEY'RE NOT GIVING IT AWAY FROM FREE.\nHOW MANY OF THESE THINGS WE THINK THEY REALLY ARE GIVING\nAWAY FOR FREE? IF YOU ARE SOMEHOW THIS\nALTRUISTIC PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY GIVING THIS AWAY FREE.\n>> AND SUBS DIEDSING THE REST OF THE WORLD.\n>> HOW MUCH IS REALLY GIVEN AWAY FROM FREE.\n>> I THINK THEY PUT OUT A NUMBER GIVING 750,000 EPIPENS AWAY FROM\nFREE. I SAW THAT.\nI'LL DOUBLE-CHECK AND MAKE SURE THAT WAS RIGHT.\nTHE ARGUMENT OF THE PAYERS IS THAT THAT OBFUSCATES THE PATIENT\nSYSTEM PROGRAM. THE CO-PAY OBFUSCATES THE ISSUE\nOF THE DRUG PRICES. JOE MAKES A VALID POINT.\nMYLAN ISN'T UNIQUE IN RAISING THE PRICE OF A DRUG IN THIS WAY.\nA LOT OF COMPANIES DO IT. IT'S SOME COMPANY SUDDENLY GETS\nTHIS KIND OF ATTENTION PAID TO IT AND THEY'RE EVIL AND GREEDY.\nWHAT THE DRUG INDUSTRY IS CONCERNED ABOUT THIS IS GOING TO\nSTART SPREADING TO THE REST OF THE INDUSTRY.\nNOW, OF COURSE THE MIDDLE WHEN WHWE DON'T TALK ABOUT AS MUCH.\nWE DON'T LOOK AT THEIR ROLE AS MUCH.\nTHEY'RE STARTING TO GET ATTENTION TO.\n>> WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE P BMS. THAT'S ONE COMPONENT.\nDO THE RETAILERS THEMSELVES. DO THE OTHER MIDDLE MEN HAVE A\nRESPONSIBILITY TO STEP AND YOU HAPPEN GIVE US TRANSPARENCY TOO\nIN THIS. >> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.\n. THE PHARMACY MANAGERS ARE\nPRESENTED AS THE FOLKS WHO SAVE PEOPLE MONEY.\nTHEY NEGOTIATE THE DISCOUNTS.  DRUG PRICES.\nTHEY WERE ALSO DOWN. THEIR STOCKS FELL YESTERDAY TOO.\nAS THERE IS CONCERN THAT A PRESSURE ON DRUG PRICES MAY MAKE\nIT MORE DIFFICULT FOR INVESTORS TO VALUE THE ENTIRE SUPPLY\nCHANGE. >> WHAT'S FRUSTRATING AND\nANNOYING IS PEOPLE LOVE A KNEE-JERK REACTION IN A POSTER\nCHILD FOR CORPORATE GREED. THEY DON'T NEED TO LOOK AT ANY\nOF THE SURROUNDING ISSUES. >> EVERYBODY WANTS MORE\nCOMPETITION. YOU WOULD EVEN AGREE THAT YOU\nWOULD WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE PRICES, RIGHT?\n>> SURE. >> THAT'S THE OTHER PIECE OF IT.\n>> I KNOW THAT'S THE OTHER PART.  WE HAVE A SYSTEM HERE.\nWE COULD CHANGE IT AND GO TO EVERYTHING YOU MATCH EXPENSES\nAND WHAT YOU BRING IN SO THAT IT'S EXACTLY ZERO.\nAND THAT EVERYBODY BENEFITS AND I THINK THERE'S ANOTHER SYSTEM\nFOR THAT CALLED WE CAN NATIONALIZE EVERYTHING.\nEVERYTHING COULD BE NOT FOR PROFIT AND TRY TO DO IT THAT\nWAY. ANYTHING YOU MAKE OVER AND ABOVE\nEXPENSES, YOU HAVE TO GIVE BACK. THAT'S ONE WAY OF DOING THINGS.\nSEE WHAT WORKS. SEE IF YOU HAVE INVASION.\n>> THAT WOULD BE THE ARGUMENT OF THE DRULG INDUSTRY.\nIF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT INSEN TIFF TO MAKE MONEY, INVESTORS\nWON'T GIVE YOU MONEY TO INVEST. >> IT'S WHAT WE HAVE.\nYES, WE HAVE A PATENT SYSTEM. WHEN IT IS SET UP TO GENERIC TO\nME. >> YOU MAXIMIZE COMPETITION IN A\nFAIR WAY. >> THIS IS THE STORY WE SHOULD\nBE FOCUSING ON WHY THERE'S NO MORE COMPETITION.\n>> WE WANT A PERSON LIKE MARTEN STREK AND HAVE HIM AND PUT HIS\nPICTURE THERE AND THROW DARTS AT IT.\n>> BOTH INSTANCES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DRUGS THAT EXISTED FOR A\nVERY LONG TIME.

AFTER HILLARY CLINTON POINTED\nTHE FINGER AT MYLAN JUST EARLIER THIS WEEK.\nHOW DOES THIS CONTINUE TO PLAY OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL?\n>> WELL, IT WILL BE INTERESTING BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THIS HAS BEEN\nAN ISSUE, BUT NOT THE BIGGEST ISSUE OBVIOUSLY ON THE CAMPAIGN\nTRAIL HERE. CERTAINLY FOR PEOPLE WHO USE\nTHOSE EPIPENS, IT'S A BIG CONCERN.\nAND IT SPEAKS TO HOW AND HOW MUCH THE GOVERNMENT GETS\nINVOLVED IN ISSUES LIKE THIS THAT INVOLVE THE PRIVATE SECTOR.\nFOR HILLARY CLINTON RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF POINTING THE FINGER,\nIT'S POINTSING SQUARELY AT DONALD TRUMP.\nSHE NOW HAS A NEW MESSAGE -- AN ADJUSTED MESSAGE I SHOULD SAY\nABOUT DONALD TRUMP NOT ONLY ATTRACTING, BUT EMPOWERING\nDANGEROUS HATE GROUPS HERE IN THE UNITED STATES.\nSHE SAYS HIS MESSAGE AND SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT HE'S HIRED LIKE\nCONSERVATIVE STEVE BANNON ARE EMPOWERING HATE GROUPS HERE IN\nTHE UNITED STATES.

HE SAID HE'S GOING TO PUT OUTS A\nBIG SPEECH ON THIS. DO WE HAVE ANY INDICATION WHEN\nTHAT WILL TAKE PLACE AND WHAT TO EXPECT.\n>> Reporter: HIS CAMPAIGN HAS SAID MORE DETAILS IN A COUPLE OF\nWEEKS. WHAT WE KNOW FROM THE PUBLIC\nAPPEARANCES AND INTERVIEWS IS THAT HE STILL SAYS HE WANTS TO\nBUILD THE WALL WITH MEXICO, BUT WHEN IT COMES TO DEALING WITH\nTHE 11 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED RESIDENTS ALREADY IN THIS\nCOUNTRY, INSTEAD OF TRYING TO SEND THEM ALL BACK HOME AT ONCE,\nWHAT HE'S NOW SAYING IS KIND OF WHAT WE HEARD PRESIDENT OBAMA\nSAY THAT HE WANTS TO PRIORITIZE.

LET'S BRING IN CHRIS WHO IS A\nDEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST AND CROW OF PARK STREET STRATEGIES.\nTHANK YOU FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING.\n>> YOU WERE AMONG THOSE SAYING TRUMP HAD BEEN IN A DEEP HOLE.\nDO YOU THINK HE'S DONE ENOUGH TO GET OUT.\n>> HE'S IN AS DEEP A HOLE I'VE EVER SEEN A CANDIDATE IN THE\nPRESIDENTIAL RACE. WHEN YOU'RE DOWN TEN POINTS IN A\nPOLL THAT JUST CAME OUT, IT'S BAD.\nWHEN YOU HAVE THE DEMOGRAPHIC PROBLEMS HE HAD, IT'S EVEN\nWORSE. YOU'RE BEHIND IN TERMS OF\nHISPANIC LEVELS IN HISTORIC LEVELS.\nHE'S AROUND LOW 20S AND THAT'S BEING GENEROUS.\nHE HAS TO BE AROUND 40 TO BE COMPETITIVE.\nHIS SUPPORT AMONGST AFRICAN-AMERICANS IS\nSTATISTICALLY ZERO ON MOST OF THESE POLLS WHICH IS ALMOST\nLAUGHABLY IMPOSSIBLE. NOT THAT ANY REPUBLICAN IS GOING\nTO GET A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE, BUT YOU NEED TO HAVE A CERTAINLY\nMIX TO BE COMPETITIVE AND HE'S NOT DOING IT.\nHE HAS TO TRY TO MAKE A SHIFT HENCE THIS POSITIONING THAT HE'S\nTRYING TO TAKE NOW ABOUT IMFRAGS REFORM OR NEW POSITION WHICH\nSTILL HE'S IN A REAL BOX IN. HE CHANGES TOO\nALIENATES SUPPORTERS. >> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE\nCHANGES ON THE CAMPAIGN TEAM? WE DO SENSE MORE LESS -- MORE\nSCRIPTED YOU MIGHT SAY. LESS DECISIVE IN THE LAST FEW\nWEEKS. DOES THAT CONTINUE TO HELP HIM?\n>> THE PROBLEM IS THE DAMAGE THAT'S BEEN DONE.\nEVEN THOUGH IT'S 70 DAYS, CERTAIN PERCEPTIONS START\nGETTING CEMENTED IN. HE'S AT A POINT WHERE THE DEBATE\nHAS TO BE HIS ONE DEFINING MOMENT HE CHANGES THINGS.\nTHAT PUTS HIM IN A DIFFICULT SPOT BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON IS\nA GOOD DEBATER. SHE'S NOT GOING TO GO IN THERE\nAND MAKE ANY KIND OF SIGNIFICANT MISTAKE.\n>> YOU ARE COMING -- WE ARE DISCUSSING WITH YOU COMING FROM\nA DEMOCRATIC ANGLE. VIEWERS WATCHING OUT THERE WHO\nMAY BE COMING FROM THE OTHER SIDE MAY SAY SO WHAT.\nYOU HAVE A CANDIDATE WHO SHAKES THINGS UP.\nHIS MESSAGE IS CLEAR. CANDIDATES CAN COME BACK FROM\nSEEING LOWER LEVELS IN THE POLL. WE'VE SEEN THAT IN THE PAST.\n>> WE HAVE SEEN IT IN THE PAST. IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT THIS\nOBJECTIVELY, THE MESSAGE THAT TRUMP HAS IN TERMS OF BIG\nSTRUCTURAL CHANGE, THE ARGUMENT THAT THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED AND\nWE'RE JUST DOING THE STORY ABOUT MYLAN, THAT FEEDS INTO THE\nNOTION THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE THAT CORPORATE AMERICA JUST\nDOESN'T GET IT. THE PROBLEM IS HE HASN'T\nEXPLOITED THAT STRUCTURAL ADVANTAGE THAT EXISTS WITHIN THE ELECTORATE.\nIS THERE TIME? SURE.\nAT THIS POINT IN THE A PRESIDENTIAL RACE YOU HAVE TO DO\nSOMETHING DRAMATIC TO SHAKE IT UP.\nHENCE HE'S GOING TO GO INTO DEBATES WITH A STRATEGY TO TRY\nTO ROCK HER. SOMEHOW SHAKE HER.\nTHAT'S A TOUGH PLACE FOR A CANDIDATE TO BE IN.\n>> CHRIS, YOU JUST MENTIONED MYLAN YOURSELF.\nI HAVE TO ASK YOU BECAUSE YOU FORMERLY WERE THE CHIEF OF STAFF\nFOR SENATOR JOE FATHER OF THE CURRENT CEO OF MYLAN.\nONE, IS HE IN A TRICKY SITUATION HERE LOOKING AT THE PRESSURE\nCOMING FROM CAPITOL HILL AND HOW HAS HE HANDLED THE SITUATION SO\nFAR. >> IN FULL DISCLOSURE, I KNOW\nHEATHER BECAUSE I WAS CLEEF OF STAFF OF SENATOR MANSION.\nIT'S A TOUGH POSITION TO BE IN. WHEN YOU'RE A COMPANY AND YOU'RE\nTRYING TO MAKE THE ARGUMENT AS HEATHER WAS THAT SOMEHOW THE\nRISING PRICES WAS BECAUSE OF THE HEALTH CARE CRISIS, IT JUST\nDOESN'T REALLY GO FAR ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN THE SITUATION.\nSO I THINK THE SENATOR IS IN A DIFFICULT SPOT BECAUSE IT'S HIS\nDAUGHTER, BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT'S A SERIOUS ISSUE WHERE HE'S\nGOING TO BE USED AT A POLITICAL PUNCHING BAG, ESPECIALLY GOING\nINTO THE NEXT ELECTION. IT'S A TOUGH SPOT FOR HIM TO BE\nIN. I HAVE TO BELIEVE THEY'RE GOING\nTO TAKE A MORE AGGRESSIVE ROLE. NO COMPANY WANTS TO BE A\nPOLITICAL ISSUE. YOU DON'T WANT TO BE A POLITICAL\nISSUE IN THIS PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.\n>> AND KNOWING HER, HOW DO YOU JUDGE HER RESPONSE YESTERDAY?\nSPEAKING TO CNBC SHE WAS EXPRESSING FRUSTRATION SAYING\nTHE SYSTEM IS BROKEN YET LOOK AT HER PAY.\n>> AS SOMEONE WHO ADVISES COMPANIES AND OTHERS IN TERMS OF\nHOW TO DEAL WITH CRISIS, I WOULD NOT GIVE THEM A GREAT GRADE IN\nTERMS OF THE RESPONSE. I WILL GIVE FREE ADVICE TO EVERY\nCOMPANY OUT THERE. IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS, YOU\nNEVER SOMEHOW BLAME SOMEONE ELSE.\nDO YOU HAVE TO TAKE SOME DEGREE OF RESPONSIBILITY.\nOWN THE PROBLEM AND MAKE IT CLEAR WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO TO\nFIX IT. SUGGESTING THERE IS A HEALTH\nCARE CRISIS THAT IS EXPLAINING OR JUSTIFYING THIS, DOESN'T PASS\nTHE LAUGH TEST WITH MOST PEOPLE. >> SO WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS?\nWILL THEY HAVE TO CUT PRICES? GO FURTHER THAN THIS DISCOUNT\nTHEY'RE OFFERING ON SOME EPIPENS?\n>> YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A PRODUCT THAT -- REGARDLESS WHAT\nEDUCATION LEVEL, REGARDLESS WHETHER THEY KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT\nBUSINESS. SOMEONE IS IN A MOMENT OF\nCRISIS, THEY NEED IT TO SURVIVE. WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT\nKIND OF PRODUCT, RAISING PRICES SO A FAMILY CAN'T AFFORD THEM,\nSOME OF THE STORIES OF THE PRICE GOING UP TO $1,500 TO HAVE A\nSUPPLY FOR THEIR CHILD. THAT'S A DANGEROUS PLACE FOR A\nCOMPANY TO BE. I CAN'T IMAGINE THEY'RE NOT\nGOING TO DROP THE PRICES MORE. BECAUSE THIS IS GOING TO GROW.\nYOU'RE GOING TO SEE THIS BECOME A CONGRESSIONAL ISSUE.\nIT'S GOING TO BECOME A PRESIDENTIAL ISSUE.\nYOU DON'T WANT TO BE IN THAT STORM IF YOU'RE A COMPANY.\n>> CHRIS, WHERE SHE TO GO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nDEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF FOR SENATOR JOE\nMANSION AS MENTIONED.",

JUDGING BY SOCIAL MEDIA, MANY\nWERE CONVINCED THAT SHE IS A HEARTLESS ARROGANT INDIVIDUAL\nWHO PRETENDED TO SYMPATHIZE AND TALKED ABOUT THE HEALTH CARE\nSYSTEM. THE CONSENSUS SEEMS TO BE THAT\nSHE SHOULD ROLL THEM BACK RIGHT ON TELEVISION, GIVING AMERICANS\nTHE SAME LOW PRICES YOU CAN GET IN OTHER MARKETS OUTSIDE THE\nUNIT. TO OTHERS, BRESH IS DOING HER\nJOB. NO ONE'S STOPPING HER, AND WE\nSHOULDN'T EXPECT HER CONSCIENCE TO KICK IN IF SHE'S WORKING AT A\nPUBLIC COMPANY. THESE PEOPLE SAY WHY SHOULD THE\nGOVERNMENT STEP IN? HOW ELSE DO WE GET THESE\nFABULOUS MEDICINES. WHERE DO I COME OUT?\nFIRST, I HAVE FAITH THAT THE FREE MARKET WILL COME UP WITH A\nCOMPETITIVE PRODUCT THAT DRIVE THE PRICE OF THE EPI-PEN DOWN\nAND BIG. I KNOW THIS, HOW?\nBECAUSE I'VE BOUGHT THE COMPETITOR BEFORE THE FDA TOOK\nIT OFF THE MARKET. GOOD ADVICE.\nSECOND, I'M AGAINST MONOPOLIES WHERE THERE SHOULDN'T BE ONE.\nWE DON'T LET THE UTILITIES CHARGE WHATEVER THEY WANT.\nTHEY'RE REGULATED. WE ENDORSE HIGHER PRICES FOR\nDRUGS WHERE THE PATIENT POPULATION IS TOO LOW FOR THE\nCOMPANY TO TAKE THE RISK OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR\nSOMETHING THAT THERE COULD NEVER BE A PAYOFF FOR.\nTHEY'RE ALMOST ALL PRICED BELOW THE COST OF CARE THAT A HEALTH INSURER WOULD HAVE TO BEAR.\nTHEN THERE'S THE GRAY AREA, WHERE PRICES COULD BE INCREASED\nAND THE PATIENT WITH A HIGH DEDUCTIBLE PLAN IS GETTING HUNG\nOUT TO DRY WHEN THE PRICE POINT IS ELEVATED $600 FOR A PAIR OF\nLIFE-SAVING EPI-PENS. WE THINK IT WAS TRYING TO SNEAK\nIN A FEW EXTRA DOLLARS UNTIL A COMPETITOR COMES ALONG WITH A\nGENERIC ALTERNATIVE. SO AT LEAST FOR THE MOMENT,\nMYLAN GOT AWAY WITH IT, AND THE BIG MANAGERS THAT ARE SUPPOSED\nTO NEGOTIATE BETTER PRICING, FAILED TO DO SO.\nMYLAN HAD ALL THE COVERAGE, WHAT'S THE DEAL?\nAND THERE IN LIES THE PROBLEM. WE HAVE TO HOPE THE COMPANIES\nHAVE A HEART, SO TO SPEAK, BECAUSE THERE'S REALLY NOT MUCH\nWE CAN DO, GIVEN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WE HAVE, WE'RE STUCK WITH\nCAJOLING COMPANIES THAT PUT THROUGH UNREASONABLE PRICE\nINCREASES. THE REAL ISSUE HERE IS IS\nCOMPETITION, SADLY, JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING'S GENERIC, AND I KNOW\nA LOT OF YOU FEEL THIS ISN'T TRUE, DOESN'T MEAN THERE ISN'T\nCOMPETITION. I TAKE A PARTICULAR MEDICINE\nWHERE THERE USED TO BE A TON OF COMPETITION, NO MORE THOUGH,\nWHY? NOT ENOUGH MONEY.\nSO THE COMPANY THAT MAKES THE DRUG AND THE DEVICE USED TO\nDELIVER IT IS NOW A MONOPOLY. THE PRICE PER EACH USE, DESPITE\nTHE FACT THAT THE DOSE IS LESS THAN $10 A SHOT, EACH SHOT IS\n$125. GIVEN THAT I HAVE TO TAKE 20\nSHOTS A MONTH, THAT'S $2500 A MONTH VERSUS $200.\nINSURERS DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR IT.\nIF ANOTHER COMPANY WERE TO GET INTO IT, THE PRICE WOULD PLU\nPLUMMET. I'M LUCKY ENOUGH THAT I CAN\nAFFORD IT. HOW ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE?\nI DON'T KNOW. THE BOTTOM LINE, THERE'S CLEARLY\nA GLITCH IN THE DRUG SYSTEM. ONE THAT REQUIRES MORE\nREGULATION OR COMPETITION THAN WE HAVE.\nPRESIDENTIAL TWEETS, THEY DON'T SOLVE THE BIGGER PROBLEM.\nJOE IN NEW JERSEY? >> Caller: HELLO, CRAMER.\n>> NICE TO HAVE YOU BACK. >> I DID THIS SHOW FROM MY\nGARDEN.

HEATHER BRESCH IS SAYING IT'S\nTHE SYSTEM AND THE PBMs IS SAYING BLAMING US IS A RED\nHERRING. WHERE DO YOU PLACE THE BLAME?\n>> \"FAST MONEY\" IS CERTAINLY THE PLACE TO TALK ABOUT IT BECAUSE\nMYLAN HAS GOTTEN TO THE PEOPLE IN MOY CONSTITUENCY WHO FACE A\nLIFE AND DEATH SYSTEM. IT'S PRICE GOUGING ACROSS THE\nPHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY AND WE REALLY DO NEED TO GET AT THE\nGOVERNMENT-APPROVED MONOPOLIES CHARGING MONOPOLY PRICE GOUGING\nPRICES. >> YOU THINK THAT THERE'S NOT A\nDEEPER ISSUE HERE? I'M ASKING YOU THIS BECAUSE IT'S\nNOT JUST THIS DRUG AND IT SEEMS THAT CONGRESS SHINES A BRIGHT\nLIGHT WHENEVER THERE IS AN EGREGIOUS EXAMPLE.\nFOR EXAMPLE, MARTIN SHKRELI COMES OUT AND VALEANT SERVICES\nSHORTLY AFTER THAT AND THEN THE EPI-PEN CONTROVERSIAL, AND IN\nBETWEEN THERE ARE LULLS. THERE'S NOT A REAL EFFORT IT\nSEEMS TO GET AT A ROOT OF THE PROBLEM, SO ARE YOU JUST SAYING\nTHAT IT'S BAD ACTORS IN THE PHARMACEUTICALS INDUSTRY THAT\nARE PRICE GOUGING ON THIS, OR IS THERE SOMETHING SYSTEMIC\nINVOLVED? >> I'M SAYING THERE'S SERIOUS\nBAD ACTORS, INDUSTRY PRACTICES WITH GOVERNMENT-APPROVED\nMONOPOLIES WHERE COMPETITION IS NOT WORKING TO BRING ABOUT\nREASONABLE PRICES. THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT HAS BEEN\nGOING ON FOR YEARS. YOU'RE RIGHT.\nCONGRESS ONLY TAKES NOTE WHEN SOME CRISIS LIKE THIS DEVELOPS.\nWE NEED TO OVERCOME THE TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF CAMPAIGN\nCONTRIBUTIONS AND LOBBYING EXPENDITURES OF BIG PHARMA.\nWE NEED TO LOOK AT ALL ASPECTS OF THE SYSTEM INCLUDING THE PBMs\nBUT THE PROBLEM IS CENTERED ON PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS\nTHAT DON'T HAVE EFFECTIVE COMPETITION.\nIT'S NOT LIMITED TO MYLAN. IT'S SPREAD ALL ACROSS THE\nINDUSTRY. WE JUST SAW WITHIN THE LAST WEEK\nPFIZER AND ITS ACQUISITION OF A COMPANY NOW PENDING LARGELY OVER\nA DRUG THAT COST OVER $100,000 A YEAR TO TREAT PROSTATE CANCER.\nCOMPETITION IS NOT WORKING THERE.\nTHE ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT DONE ENOUGH AND CONGRESS HAS SAT ON\nITS HANDS AS BIG PHARMA HAS KEPT THIS ISSUE ENTIRELY OFF THE\nAGENDA. >> SURE.\nAS YOU POINT OUT, IT'S NOT JUST MYLAN THAT'S DOING THIS.\nTHERE ARE MANY. HOW FAR DO YOU GO, CONGRESSMAN?\nDO YOU GO DOWN THE LIST OF PRODUCTS AT VARIOUS\nPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES AND SAY THIS PRICE WAS INCREASED BY \"X\"\nPERCENT OVER THIS TIME FRAME, AND, THEREFORE, THAT WARRANTS AN\nINVESTIGATION? MYLAN IS NOT ALONE, SO TO BE\nFAIR, I MEAN HOW FAR ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO GO?\n>> WELL, OUR PRESCRIPTION DRUG TASK FORCE IS TRYING TO GET THIS\nISSUE BACK ON THE AGENDA, AND JUST AS THERE'S NOT ONE COMPANY\nTHAT'S A PROBLEM BUT MANY -- THERE ARE MANY ANSWERS THAT NODE\nTO BE PROVIDED. I THINK WE NEED, AND I AGREED\nWITH THE MYLAN EXECUTIVE WHOSE INTERVIEW I SAW ON YOUR PROGRAM\nEARLIER TODAY. I THINK WE NEED MORE\nTRANSPARENCY. WE NEED TO HAVE A GOOD\nINDICATION OF WHETHER THESE PRICES ARE RELATED AT ALL TO\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. FRANKLY I FIND THE ARGUMENT THAT\nWE'RE GOING TO STILL INNOVATION IF WE DO SOMETHING ABOUT PRICES,\nTO HAVE LITTLE MERIT BECAUSE COMPANIES LIKE MYLAN AND PHIZERS\nARE DEVOING FAR MORE TO ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION THAN\nTHEY ARE TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.\nI THINK SOME OF OUR LARGER PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES ARE\nREALLY LAGGING IN HELPING US GET INNOVATION AND CURES TO DISEASES\nAND RESPONSES THAT WE NEED RIGHT NOW IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM,\nBUT THEY ARE CHARGING OUTRAGEOUS PRICES.\nANOTHER GOOD POINT THAT THE MYLAN EXECUTIVE MADE THAT I\nAGREE WITH IS THAT WE'RE SUBSIDIZING THE REST OF THE\nWORLD. I DISAGREE WITH HER THAT I THINK\nTHERE'S ANY MERIT IN AMERICAN CONSUMERS AND TAXPAYERS AND\nPREMIUM PAYERS HAVING TO FINANCE THE RESEARCH FOR ALL OF THE REST\nOF THE WORLD AND PAY THE WORLD'S HIGHEST PRICES FOR PRESCRIPTION\nDRUGS. THIS EPI-PEN PROBLEM IS A REAL\nONE. I'VE TALKED PERSONALLY WITH\nFOLKS HERE IN OUR AREA WHO ARE FACING A CRISIS OF WHETHER THEY\nUSED AN EXPIRED EPI-PEN, WHETHER THEY CAN HEY FORD A SECOND ONE\nFOR THE GRANDPARENTS AND THE LIKE.\nWE'VE GOT TO GET AHOLD OF THAT PROBLEM, AND I THINK THE JUSTICE\nDEPARTMENT REAL NEEDS TO BE LOOK AT EPI-PEN AND MYLAN AND THE\nAGREEMENTS THEY NEGOTIATE WITH SOME OF THESE SCHOOLS TO KEEP\nOUT THE COMPETITION. THERE IS A COMPETITIVE PRODUCT\nOUT THERE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE ASKING THEIR PHYSICIANS ABOUT.\n>> CONGRESSMAN, THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.\nWE APPRECIATE IT. >> THANK YOU.\n>> CONGRESSMAN DOGGETT JOINING US FROM TEXAS, CALLING FOR\nESSENTIALLY A DOJ INVESTIGATION NOW OF MYLAN.\n>> RIGHT. THIS IS A SPECIAL -- MYLAN IS A\nSPECIALTY PHARMA COMPANY. THE PRICE HIKES WERE EGREGIOUS.\n>> MOSTLY A GENERIC DRUG COMPANY.\n>> THIS ONE IS REALLY TAKING THE WIND OUT OF THE SAILS WITH, YOU\nKNOW, FOR THE BIOTECHS IN GENERAL BUT HERE'S THE PROBLEM.\nTHE ROOT IS D.C. IT'S WASHINGTON'S POLICY AND\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT D.C. AND SAY ALL THESE LOBBYISTS -- THE\nLOBBYISTS ARE THE DEEPEST POCKETS IN D.C. ARE THE PHARMA\nGUYS AND BIG PHARMA LOBBYISTS. THEY ARE THE ONES PUSHING THE\nBUTTONS OF D.C. AND GETTING THEM NOT TO MAKE -- ESSENTIALLY NOT\nALLOWING THEM OR FORCING NOT TO MAKE CHANGE.\n>> WHEN YOU SAY TO MAKE IT CHANGEABLE, WHEN YOU SAY IT'S A\nMYLAN PROBLEM? >> HE SAID THERE'S MANY BAD\nACTORS OUT THERE. >> AND THE BAD ACTORS --\n>> SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THE IBB IS GOING LOWER AND THE PFIZER THAT\nI'VE BEEN LONG FOREVER IS GOING LOWER, THAT UNITED HEALTH CARE\nIS GOING LOWER. IT SOUNDS TO ME THAT GILAD IS\nGOING OVER. >> SENATOR GRASSLEY, BY THE WAY,\nSAID HE WOULD NOT TAKE OFF THE TABLE LOOKING AT THE PBMs AS\nWELL. >> EVERYTHING IS GOING LOWER.\n>> SO EASY TO SAY. FOR A POLITICIAN TO GET UP THERE\nAND -- AND JUMP ON THAT SOAPBOX AND SCREAM WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE\nDRUG PRICING. >> HERE'S THE THING --\n>> IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THEY ACTUALLY CHANGE IT!\nIT'S THE RHETORIC. >> CORRECT.\n>> AND I'VE BEEN SAYING THAT ALL ALONG THE.\nTHE SENTIMENT TRADE. HOW ARE PEOPLE SET UP?\nLOOK AT HILLARY CLINTON'S TWEETS AND VALUATIONS WHEN SHOW TWEETED\nOUT DRUG SGHOSTS. >> AND HOW LONG DID IT TAKE TO\nRECOVER. >> LOOK AT JUST THE FUNDAMENTALS\nOF THE BUSINESS. DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S A DRUG\nCOMPANY OR NOT. THEY SELL A PRODUCT THAT THEY\nWILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO INCREASE THE PRICE ON.\nTHAT'S THE TOP. THEIR COSTS ARE STAYING THE\nSAME. THE PRICE IS STAYING THE SAME\nAND PROBABLY GOING LOWER. THERE IS NO WAY IN THIS\nENVIRONMENT THAT ANY DRUG COMPANY IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO\nRAISE PRICES AT ANY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT.\nTHEREFORE, I AGREE WITH STEVE, THEY ARE ALL GOING LOWER.\nTHERE'S NO WAY. A FEW DRUG CEOs ARE GOING TO\nRAISE PRICES. >> LET ME ASK YOU THIS ONE\nQUESTION. THE HILLARY -- LET ME ASK -- LET\nME ASK THIS ONE QUESTION. >> GO AHEAD.\n>> AFTER THE HILLARY TWEET, IT WASN'T A ONE-DAY PHENOMENON.\nTHE DROP WENT ONE DAY, OVER TIME AND HOW LONG DID THE RECOVERY\nTAKE? MY QUESTION IS HOW LONG DID THE\nRECOVERY -- >> A WHILE.\n>> DO YOU WANT TO STAY IN THAT TRADE RIGHT NOW?\n>> WITH THE VALUATION. >> WITH THE ELECTION AROUND THE\nCORNER. >> WE SAW TODAY LOOK -- DID YOU\nSEE ANY WEAKNESS IN THE SPACE TODAY?\nNO. >> DOWN 2%.\nIBB WAS DOWN 2%. >> TWO DAYS AGO BATTLING OVER\n285, 300. IT'S 280 TODAY.\n>> THE WHOLE BUSINESS PLAN HAS CHANGED.\nLOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO -- >> YOUR TRADE AFTER THE ELECTION\nMIGHT HAVE SOME BITE TO IT, BUT WHO WOULD WANT TO SIT IN THE\nTRADE FOR THAT LONG? >> THE PRIMARY SHAREHOLDERS OF\nTHESE STOCKS, THE GUYS AT THE BIG MUTUAL FUND COMPANIES, THE\nGENERALISTS, THEY ARE OUT IF THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE STORY\nBY NOW. THEY ARE OUT AND GONE.\nTHE GUYS THAT UNDERSTAND THE STORY, THE GENERALISTS, I'M\nSORRY, THE SPECIALISTS THAT DIG DEEP INTO THESE STORIES, HAVE\nTHEIR HARMS AROUND THIS DRUG PRICING WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT IT\nIS. >> YOUR ASSUMPTION THAT PART OF\nTHE RECOVERY WE'VE SEEN IN IBB HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY SENTIMENT AND\nNOT THE GENERALISTS? >> THAT'S WHAT WOULD IGNITE THE\nTRADE TO THE HIGHER LEVELS. >> KAREN?\n>> I THINK ABOUT IT AS MORE A MONUMENTAL CHANGE.\nIN OTHER INDUSTRIES WHERE THERE'S A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY\nAND THEN IT SHIFTS AND TRANSPARENCY BECOMES PART OF THE\nEQUATION, THAT NORMALLY ISN'T A GOOD THING, AND YOU HAVE ALL\nTHE -- ALL THE SENTIMENT AND THAT SURROUNDING THIS.\nTHIS SEEMS LIKE ONE OF THOSE TIMES.\nTHEY WON'T BE ABLE TO MAKE THE MARGINS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN\nMAKING WHICH SEEM EGREGIOUS FROM THE OUTSIDE.\nA RIDICULOUSLY GOOD EXAMPLE AND I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT THEY WERE\nTHINKING WHEN THEY PUT THE PRICE INCREASE THROUGH HAND AND YOU\nKNOW NEVER WHAT THE CATALYST IS GOING TO BE.\nTHE SPOTLIGHT IS ON THE INDUSTRY AND I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY WILL GO\nBACK TO BUSINESS AS SGLUSHL WHEN THE \"TODAY\" SHOW HAS IN ITS\nFIRST HOUR A SPOT ON EPI-PEN FOR DAYS ON END, THAT MEANS IT'S NOT\nGOING AWAY.

IF YOU LOOK AT CEO'S SALARY,\nTHAT'S ONE THING. THEY HAVE EVERY RIGHT UNDER THE\nLAW TO RAISE THE PRICE. THIS IS A MONOPOLY THAT THEY\nHAVE AND THE MONOPOLY IS BEING CAUSED BY THE FD\nANY FAULT OF THEIR OWN. IT'S THE FDA THAT CREATED THE\nSITUATION IN THE FIRST PLACE. THE WAY TO LOWER PRICES OF DRUGS\nIS COMPETITION. >> HOW DID THE FDA CREATE THIS?\n>> THEY HAVEN'T APPROVED THE GENERIC BRAND AND THEY HAVEN'T\nAPPROVED THE COMPETITIVE BRANDS. IT'S JUST EPINEPHRINE.\nIT COSTS 3 CENTS PER DOSE. THE ISSUE IS THIS COMPANY HAS A\nMONOPOLY. OTHER COMPANIES WANT TO ENTER\nTHE MARKETPLACE. THEY'VE BEEN QUASHED AT EVERY\nTURN AND IT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY TO THE MARKET.\n>> IN A WAY THIS PUSHES THE FDA TO ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN.\n>> YEAH, THE PEOPLE SHOULD PUSH THE FDA.\nINSTEAD OF GETTING ON THE COMPANY'S CASE, THEY'RE DOING\nWHAT THEY'RE LEGALLY ALLOWED TO DO.\nGET ON THE FDA'S CASE. THERE SHOULD BE PROTESTS OUTSIDE\nOF THE FDA TO GET THEM TO APPROVE COMPETITIVE DRUGS, NOT\nJUST IN THIS MARKET BUT OTHER MARKETS AS WELL.\nWHAT ARE THEY DOING? >> A LOT OF PEOPLE CONCERNED\nABOUT HER SALARY AND SHE HAD THIS TO SAY ON \"MORNINGS WITH\nMARIA.\" THIS WAS BACK IN FEBRUARY.\nLISTEN. >> EPI-PENS FROM MYALIN TODAY\nREPRESENTS LESS THAN 8%. CERTAINLY DOESN'T TAKE AWAY THE\nIMPORTANCE BUT FROM A DIVERSIFICATION, THAT'S WHAT OUR\nSCALE CONTINUES TO DO FOR US. NOT RELY ON ANY ONE PRODUCT.\n>> SO ONLY 8% OF THE REVENUE. >> LOOK, SHE HAS A HIGH SALARY.\nIT'S THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\nTHIS IS A FREE MARKET. IT'S A COMPANY.\nIF THE SHAREHOLDERS OF THAT COMPANY DO NOT LIKE HER SALARY,\nTHEY SHOULD FIRE HER OR THEY SHOULD GIVE HER A LOWER SALARY.\nTHAT'S HOW WE LOWER SALARY. I THINK CEO'S SALARIES ARE OUT\nOF CONTROL IN GENERAL AND WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT T.\nIT'S NOT THE GOVERNMENT, IT'S THE SHAREHOLDERS.\n>> THEY ARE DOING SOMETHING.

ALSO WE HAVE THE NEW JERSEY STAR\nLEDGER REPORTING TODAY THAT CHRIS CHRISTIE COULD BE HELPING\nDONALD TRUMP SHAPE AN IMMIGRATION POLICY.\nBUT LET'S REMIND EVERYBODY DONALD TRUMP BASICALLY TORE\nEVERYONE APART FOR BEING WEAK ON IMMIGRATION THROUGH THE PRIMARY.\nSO WHEN IS THE TIME LINE FOR DONALD TRUMP TO COME OUT WITH A\nPOLICY AND THEN STICK BY IT UNTIL THE GENERAL?\n>> AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

I THINK WE HAVE SOUND OF HIM\nEARLIER THIS WEEK WITH SEAN HANNITY, AND WHAT HE SAID JUST\nLAST NIGHT TO ANDERSON COOPER, IF WE COULD PLAY THAT.\n>> THAT'S JEB BUSH'S POLICY. >> HE WASN'T BUILDING A WALL,\nMAKING STRONG BORDERS AND I'M NOT KNOCKING JEB BUSH, BUT I WAS\nWITH HIM FOR A LONG TIME. >> RUTH, DONALD TRUMP IN HIS OWN\nWORDS WITH SEAN HANNITY SAID HE WOULD LOOK AT SOFTENING HIS\nPOSITION. YESTERDAY HE SAID, YOU KNOW, I\nDIDN'T SAY SOFTENING, IN FACT SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING I'M\nHARDENING. HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE HIS\nIMMIGRATION POLICY RIGHT NOW? >> AT THIS POINT IT IS HARD TO\nDESCRIBE. I THINK IT'S IN THE BEST\nINTEREST OF DONALD TRUMP TO LAY OUT A PLAN, TO BE DETAILED AND\nTO BE SPECIFIC. I THINK HIS TEAM IS COMING TO\nFIND THAT IMMIGRATION IS A COMPLICATED, HARD, EMOTIONAL\nISSUE. AND IT IS DIFFERENT FROM, YOU\nKNOW, HOW EASY HE EXPLAINED IT TO BE AT THE VERY BEGINNING.\nSO IT IS HARD AND EMOTIONAL. >> HOW DID HE EXPLAIN IT TO YOU\nIN THE VERY BEGINNING? >> NO, I'M NOT SAYING FROM ME\nPERSONALLY. I'M SAYING THE WAY HE HAS TALKED\nABOUT IMMIGRATION, IT IS WE'RE GOING TO SIMPLY BUILD A WALL\nTHERE. IS SO MUCH MORE TO IT AND I\nTHINK HIS TEAM IS COMING TO FIND IT IS COMPLICATED AND HARD.\nTHAT SAID, I WILL SAY SOMETHING THAT IS NOT HARD AND\nCOMPLICATED. AND IT COMES TO THE TRUTH FOR\nHILLARY CLINTON. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT SHE HAS\nFAILED TO DO TIME AND TIME AGAIN WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\n>> RUTH, WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE IMMIGRATION POLICY\nOF DONALD TRUMP IN ALL FAIRNESS HERE?\n>> IN ALL FAIRNESS -- >> THE TRUTH -- WHAT IS THE\nTRUTH ABOUT -- OKAY, SO WHICH DONALD TRUMP DO YOU BELIEVE?\nDO YOU BELIEVE THE DONALD TRUMP AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEK,\nAND PLEASE, IF IT WE CAN GET THIS SOUND. HANNITY, WHERE HE POLLED THE\nAUDIENCE AND SAID HE WOULD BE WILLING TO SOFTEN IF PEOPLE PAID\nTHEIR TAXES OR DO YOU BELIEVE THE PERSON WHO SAID HE IS\nHARDENING, DO YOU BELIEVE THE PERSON WHO TOLD \"MORNING JOE\"\nHE'S INTERESTED IN HAVING A DEPORTATION TASK FORCE.\nWHICH DONALD TRUMP DO YOU BELIEVE?\n>> WELL, TAMRON, I THINK JUST LIKE YOU, I AM TRYING TO FIGURE\nOUT WHAT HIS IMMIGRATION STANCE IS, AND I'M WAITING TO HEAR FROM\nHIM. HE HAS SAID HE'S GOING TO GIVE\nIT IN THE NEXT WEEK OR SO. AND I AM TOO WAITING FOR THAT.\nHOWEVER, THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE SAID ABOUT THE TRUTH FAILED\nTO SEE FROM HILLARY CLINTON. >> ARE YOU FAILING TO SEE TRUTH\nFROM DONALD TRUMP ON IMMIGRATION?\nBECAUSE IT SOUNDS TO ME AS IF WHAT DONALD TRUMP YOU'RE SAYING\nLET'S FIGURE IT OUT, LET'S WAIT, WHEN HE'S GIVEN TWO DIFFERENT\nANSWERS. BOTH ARE NOT TRUE.\n>> THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN -- THERE IS A DIFFERENCE\nBETWEEN HILLARY CLINTON AND TRUTH AND DONALD TRUMP FURTHER\nEXPLAINING AND THE NEED FOR FURTHER EXPLAINING HIS POLICY.\n>> JACOB -- TO YOU ON THIS. LET ME PLAY JEB BUSH AND HIS\nSTANCE THIS -- ON RITA COSBY'S SHOW, DISCUSSING TRUMP'S\nIMMIGRATION STANCE. >> I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO BELIEVE\nABOUT A GUY WHO DOESN'T BELIEVE IN THINGS.\nI MEAN, HE DOESN'T -- THIS IS ALL A GAME.\nHE DOESN'T -- HIS VIEWS WILL CHANGE, BASED ON THE FEEDBACK HE\nGETS FROM A CROWD OR, YOU KNOW, WHAT HE THINKS HE HAS TO DO.\nLIFE IS TOO COMPLEX -- FOR ME, I COULDN'T DO THAT.\nI HAVE TO BELIEVE WHAT I BELIEVE.\nAND IF IT'S POPULAR, GREAT. IF IT'S NOT, I TRY TO GET BETTER\nAT PRESENTING MY VIEWS. BUT SHIFTING MY VIEWS BECAUSE\nIT'S POLITICAL TO DO IT, THAT'S WHAT POLITICIANS DO IN THIS\nCOUNTRY. THAT'S WHAT TRUMP IS TRYING TO\nDO RIGHT NOW. I FIND IT ABHORRENT.\n>> JACOB, WHAT DO YOU ASCRIBE OR HOW DO YOU SEE TRUMP'S\nIMMIGRATION STANCE AT THIS POINT?\n>> I'M WITH RUTH. WE HAVE TO WAIT TO SEE WHAT IT\nIS. HE JUST STARTED THIS DIALOGUE.\nHE MET WITH HISPANIC LEADERS ON SATURDAY.\nHE SHOWED UP PREPARED. HE DIDN'T COMMIT TO ANYTHING.\nBUT HE ACKNOWLEDGED IN THAT MEETING THE TOUGH PART IS WHAT\nTO DO WITH THE 11 MILLION. AND AGAIN, I THINK HE DESERVES\nKUDOS FOR HAVING THE COUNTRY TALK ABOUT IMMIGRATION.\nWE'RE CLOSER NOW TO IMMIGRATION REFORM, BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP HAS\nIDENTIFIED THE SECURITY FAILURES AND HE'S ALSO GOTTEN THE RIGHT\nTO DISCUSS THE FACT THAT MOST OF THESE PEOPLE ARE GOOD, AND THEY\nNEED TO STAY HERE, IT'S IMPORTANT TO OUR ECONOMY, IT'S\nTHE HUMANE THING TO DO. IT'S NOT BAD THAT WE'RE HAVING\nTHIS DIALOGUE. BUT WE'RE HAVING IT BECAUSE\nDONALD TRUMP STARTED IT. >> BUT JACOB, ARE WE HAVING A\nREAL CONVERSATION HERE -- YOU SAY THAT DONALD TRUMP JUST\nSTARTED THIS DIALOGUE. WHEN DONALD TRUMP CAME DOWN THE\nESCALATORS, HE SAID THAT MEXICO WAS SENDING RAPISTS AND\nCRIMINALS, AND THAT HE WAS GOING TO SEND ALL OF THESE 11 MILLION\nPEOPLE BACK ACROSS THE BORDER. THE PLAN, OR TENTATIVE PLAN THAT\nHE REVEALED THIS WEEK WAS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO THE CURRENT PLAN IN\nPLACE BY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.\nIN FACT, DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF SAID, GEORGE BUSH AND PRESIDENT\nOBAMA HAD DONE A GOOD JOB, AND HE WANTED TO FOLLOW THE CURRENT\nLAWS. THE CURRENT LAWS.\nIN PLACE BY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.\nSO THEN ARE YOU GIVING PRESIDENT OBAMA CREDIT OR ANY KIND OF\nPRAISE FOR WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS ESSENTIALLY, AND I THINK CHRIS\nHAYES SAID IT, CRIBBING THE CURRENT POLICY?\n>> I THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS TO ANSWER FOR THE FACT THAT HE\nPROMISED IMMIGRATION DURING HIS FIRST TERM, HISPANICS BELIEVED\nIT, HE CHOSE HEALTH CARE REFORM. >> DID CONGRESS HAVE ANYTHING TO\nDO WITH THAT? >> WELL, HE DIDN'T PUSH IT AS AN\nAGENDA. HE CONTROLLED BOTH HOUSES OF\nCONGRESS. AND HE DOES -- DEMOCRATS DON'T\nWANT TO SOLVE THIS. IT'S A GREAT POLITICAL FOOTBALL\nFOR THEM. AND I HAVE A LOT MORE FAITH IN A\nBUSINESSMAN LIKE DONALD TRUMP WHO KNOWS THE REALITIES OF THE\nECONOMY. HE CAN BRING THE REPUBLICAN GOP\nHOUSE ON BOARD. IF YOU WANT IMMIGRATION REFORM,\nIT ONLY COMES WITH DONALD TRUMP. >> SO BUT HE WOULD BRING THEM ON\nBOARD FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PLAN THAT'S IN PLACE NOW.\n>> YOU KNOW, I THINK HE WOULD BRING HIM ON BOARD --\n>> WHICH PLAN? WHICH PLAN ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?\n>> WELL, WRE GOING TO FIND OUT NEXT WEEK.\nAND I THINK WE NEED TO BE PATIENT FOR IT.\nBUT I DON'T SEE A HILLARY PLAN. ALL HILLARY SAYS IS, I'LL DO\nMORE THAN OBAMA. COME ON!\nI MEAN, HE DESERVES A LOT OF CREDIT FOR BRINGING THIS ISSUE\nTO THE PUBLIC'S ATTENTION. AND LET'S SEE WHAT THE PLAN\nLOOKS LIKE NEXT WEEK. I HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE IT'S\nSOMETHING THAT WILL MAKE US STRONGER AND HELP THE HISPANIC\nCOMMUNITY AND THE IMMIGRANTS THAT ARE LAW-ABIDING.\nONE PROBLEM I HAVE -- >> ONE IS THE ORIGINAL PLAN AND\nTHE OTHER PLAN THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF,\nIS THE ONE THAT'S IN PLACE RIGHT NOW.\nOKAY. JACOB, RUTH, THANK YOU BOTH.\n>> WELL, NO, I'M IN THE NOT IN FAVOR OF WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW.\nBECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE IS 2 MILLION PEOPLE BEING DEPORTED BY\nOBAMA. A LOT OF THEM WERE NOT HARDENED\nCRIMINALS. HE'S BROKEN UP FAMILIES.\nNOBODY HAS CALLED HIM ON THAT. THE STATUS QUO IS NOT WORKING.\n>> DONALD TRUMP SAID HE WOULD BREAK UP FAMILIES.\nWE DON'T EVEN -- AT THIS POINT, WE DON'T EVEN -- I'M ASKING\nYOU -- >> LET'S WAIT AND SEE WHAT THE\nPLAN IS. THAT'S MY POINT.\n>> JACOB, THANK YOU. >> HILLARY HAS NO PLAN.\n>> AND THIS IS NOT REALITY. COMING UP, SENATOR JOHN McCAIN'S\nUNDERDOG PRIMARY OPPONENT GOES THERE.\n>> JOHN McCAIN IS FALLING DOWN ON THE JOB.\nHE'S GOTTEN WEAK, HE'S GOTTEN OLD.\n>> DO YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE DIAGNOSING HIM ON AIR LIKE THIS?\n>> DIAGNOSING HIM AS AN 80-YEAR-OLD MAN?\nYES, I DO. >> REPUBLICAN KELLY WARD EVEN\nMAKES MENTION OF THE AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCY, AND SAYS THE\nSOON TO BE 80 YEAR-OLD MAY NOT LIVE OUT HIS SIX-YEAR TERM.\nTHIS IS INCREDIBLE.

I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE\nBEGINNING TO SEE FROM DONALD TRUMP OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF\nWEEKS.

I THINK HE IS MAKING EFFORTS TO\nDO THAT. HE HAS CERTAINLY HAD MOMENTS\nWITH THINGS IN THE PAST WITH WHAT HE HAS SAID.\nAMERICANS WILL VOTE THIS FALL AND THEY WILL HAVE A CHOICE\nBETWEEN HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP WHO IS A WARRIOR\nFOR REGULAR AMERICANS. I THINK FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT\nCHANGE AND MOST AMERICANS THINK THE COUNTRY IS ON THE WRONG\nTRACK. THEY WANT CHANGE.\nI THINK THEY DON'T WANT WHAT BARACK OBAMA HAS BEEN GIVING US.\nI THINK AS THEY LOOK AT DONALD TRUMP I THINK THEY WILL SEE THAT\nHE IS THE CANDIDATE THAT CAN BRING ECONOMIC GROWTH AND BRING\nMORE SAFETY IN OUR COMMUNITIES. I THINK THAT'S WHAT DONALD TRUMP\nHAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO. >> REAL QUICK BECAUSE WE HAVE TO\nGO TO COMMERCIAL. ALL OF THOSE DISSATISFIED\nAMERICANS WHO WANT CHANGE, WHY DO YOU THINK IT'S NOT SHOWING UP\nIN THE POLLS? IT SAYS HILLARY CLINTON IS UP\nTEN POINTS. >> ITY IT'S BECAUSE HE HAS TO\nCONTINUE TO BROADEN HIS BASE. YOU KNOW, HE HAS RUN A CAM NAN\nIS REALLY CONNECTED WITH A LOT OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS, BASE\nVOTERS. WE THIS HAS GOT TO EXPAND THAT.\nITY THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN HIM DOING AND I THINK THAT'S WHY\nHILLARY IS NOT SERVING THE GOOD OF THIS COUNTRY AND WOULDN'T\nHELP HER TO GOVERN. I THINK DONALD TRUMP IS MAKING HEADWAY.\nGO SIT DOWN WITH 20 PEOPLE, 30 PEOPLE, HAVE A SERIOUS\nDISCUSSION ABOUT REAL ISSUES WITH REAL AMERICANS ABOUT HOW HE\nCAN BRING REAL CHANGE TO OUR COUNTRY.\n>> WE ENCOURAGE HIM TO DO THAT. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH.\n>> COMING UP, MANY PEOPLE CAME TO THE DEFENSE OF SATURDAY NIGHT\nLIVE LESLIE JONES AFTER HER WEB SITE WAS HACKED.

I AM VERY PROUD TO HAVE BROUGHT\nTHE SUBJECT OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION BACK INTO THE\nDISCUSSION. SUCH A BIG PROBLEM FOR OUR\nCOUNTRY I WILL SOLVE. JIM ACOSTA IS JOINING US NOW\nFROM LAS VEGAS WHERE DONALD TRUMP WILL HOLD A FUND-RAISER\nTODAY. JIM, PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT WHAT\nHE SAID EACH DAY AND IT'S HARDER AND HARDER TO KEEP UP WITH WHAT\nHIS POSITION IS. >> THAT'S RIGHT, BRIANNA.\nWE'RE PLAYING THIS GAME OF FOLLOWING THE BOUNCING POLICY.\nTHAT IS WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING ALL WEEK LONG WITH DONALD\nTRUMP'S POLICY ON IMMIGRATION. HE TOLD FOX HE WAS SOFTENING ON\nIMMIGRATION AND CONSIDERING A PLAN THAT WOULD ALLOW THE\nUNDOCUMENTED, IF THEY HAVE BEEN LAW ABIDING TO STAY IN THIS\nCOUNTRY AS LONG AS THEY PAY BACK TAXES.\nBUT AS WE HEARD FROM HIS INTERVIEW WITH ANDERSON COOPER\nYESTERDAY RIGHT HERE ON CNN, HE IS NOT SAYING THAT AT ALL.\nHE IS SAYING THAT THE UNDOCUMENTED IN THIS COUNTRY,\nEVEN IF THEY HAVE BEEN LAW ABIDING, WILL HAVE TO GO BACK TO\nTHEIR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN AND TOUCH BACK AND IMMIGRATION AND\nTHEN GET IN LINE AND COME BACK. THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT HIS\nCAMPAIGN MANAGER, KELLYANNE CONWAY ECHOED EARLIER THIS\nMORNING ON \"GOOD MORNING AMERICA\" ON ABC.\nHERE'S WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY. >> HE SAID NO PATH TO\nLEGALIZATION. NO PATH TO CITIZENSHIP AND NO\nPATH TO AMNESTY. YOU CAN RETURN HOME AND THEN IF\nYOU WANT TO GO STAND IN LINE LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE IS, THE\nTHING WE LEARNED IN KINDERGARTEN.\nTHAT WOULD BE EVALUATED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.\n>> NOW, I DID TALK TO A SENIOR TRUMP CAMPAIGN ADVISER EARLIER\nTHIS MORNING, BRIANNA. I WAS ASKING THIS PERSON BECAUSE\nA REPORT OUT OF NEW JERSEY SAYING NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR CHRIS\nCHRISTIE WAS ADVISING DONALD TRUMP ON THIS AND LEADING TO THE\n\"SOFTEN ON IMMIGRATION.\" SENIOR TRUMP ADVISER SAID, NO,\nTHAT IS NOT THE CASE. THIS IS DONALD TRUMP WHO IS\nOUNDING OUT THESE CHANGES AND THESE SHIFTS ON HIS POLICY ON\nIMMIGRATION. >> JIM, TELL US A LITTLE BIT\nABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE IN NEVADA.\nTHIS IS A BATTLEGROUND STATE. HILLARY CLINTON HAD BEEN THERE\nAND YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP SPENDING THE DAY IN LAKE TAHOE\nAND LAS VEGAS. WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE?\nWHO IS LEADING? >> YEAH, ACCORDING TO THE LATEST\nPOLLS HERE IN NEVADA AND, AS YOU KNOW, FROM BEING OUT HERE ON THE\nCAMPAIGN TRAIL FOR MANY, MANY YEARS.\nTHIS IS A BATTLEGROUND STATE AND IT IS, ONCE AGAIN, ACCORDING TO\nTHE LATEST POLLS HILLARY CLINTON HAS A SLIGHT LEAD IN NEVADA, BUT\nDONALD TRUMP IS MAKING A BIG PLAY FOR THE STATE, OBVIOUSLY.\nHE'S GOING TO NEED THIS STATE IN ALL LIKELIHOOD IF HE HAS ANY\nCH",

IMMIGRATION HAS BEEN CENTRAL TO\nDONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN. HE HAS TALKED ABOUT IT\nCONSISTENTLY AND WAS CONSISTENT IN HIS MESSAGE FOR A LONG TIME.\nTAKE A LISTEN. >> WE HAVE A LAW, RIGHT.\nYOU'RE SUPPOSED TO COME IN LEGALLY.\nI WOULD GET PEOPLE OUT, AND I WOULD HAVE AN EXPEDITED WAY OF\nGETTING THEM BACK INTO THE COUNTRY, SO THEY CAN BE LEGAL.\nTHEY ARE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. THEY GOT TO GO OUT.\n>> HOW DO YOU DO IT IN A PRACTICAL WAY?\n>> AT SOME POINT, WE ARE A GOING TO TRY TO GET THEM BACK, THE\nGOOD ONES. >> YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT\nHUMANLY. >> ARE YOU GOING TO BE SENDING\nIN OFFICERS? >> WE ARE A GOING TO BE SENDING\nPEOPLE IN A VERY NICE WAY, WE'RE GOING TO GIVE NOTICE.\nSAYING YOU HAVE TO GO. WE HAVE AT LEAST 11 MILLION\nPEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY THAT CAME IN ILLEGALLY.\nTHEY WILL GO OUT. THEY WILL COME BACK SOME WILL\nCOME BACK. THEY HAVE TO COME BACK LEGALLY.\n>> THAT MESSAGE, THOUGH, OF COURSE, SHIFTED A BIT AS WE SAW\nWHEN HE SPOKE WITH SHAWN HANNITY.\nLET'S LISTEN TO THAT. >> THERE CERTAINLY CAN BE A\nSOFTENING, BECAUSE WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO HURT PEOPLE.\nWE WANT PEOPLE. WE HAVE SOME GREAT PEOPLE IN\nTHIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE SOME GREAT, GREAT PEOPLE\nIN THIS COUNTRY. SO, BUT WE'RE GOING TO FOLLOW\nTHE LAWS OF THIS COUNTRY. PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE, WE HAVE\nVERY, VERY STRONG LAWS. >> SO DONALD TRUMP THERE IN HIS\nOWN WORDS, SAYING IT IS A SOFTENING, BUT THEN LAST NIGHT,\nTELLING ANDERSON COOPER, WELL, ACTUALLY IEJ'M HARDENING MY\nSTANCE. WHAT IS DONALD TRUMP'S\nIMMIGRATION POLICY THIS FRIDAY MORNING, AUGUST 26th?\nDO WE KNOW? >> OH, WE DO.\nIT HAS BEEN CONSISTENT ALL ALONG.\nJUST BECAUSE YOU USE THE WORD SOFTENING, IT DOESN'T MEAN IT IS\nCHANGING. IT IS CONSIDERING WORKING.\nI THINK THIS SHOWS THE CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE HAPPENING\nBETWEEN REPUBLICAN HOUSE AND SENATE LEADERSHIP ABOUT WHAT\nACTUALLY CAN BE DONE. WE'RE DEALING WITH A CONGRESS\nTHAT HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET MUCH DONE.\nIT HAS BEEN A STALEMATE STANDOFF BETWEEN THE WHITE HOUSE AND THIS\nCONGRESS. I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD\nSEAU SAY OKAY, IT WILL BUILD A WALL,\nA WALL THAT HILLARY CLINTON VOTED FOR WHEN SHE WAS A\nSENATOR, AND THAT BOTH OF THEM VOTED THERE NEEDED TO BE A BILL,\nWHEN THEY WERE IN CONGRESS. THERE IS GOING TO BE A WALL AND\nWE ARE GOING TO HUMANELY INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO LEAVE THIS\nCOUNTRY BUT GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO COME BACK INTO THE COUNTRY\nBECAUSE WE DO VALUE THOSE THAT WANT TO BE AMERICAN CITIZENS\nWHAT THEY BRING TO OUR COUNTRY. HE HASN'T CHANGED SINCE LAST\nYEAR. >> NO SHIFT?\nBECAUSE I THINK LISTENING TO THAT SOUND BITE, WE HEAR A\nDISTINCT SHIFT WHAT HE WAS SAYING UP UNTIL THIS POINT ON\nWEDNESDAY NIGHT. HE USED THE WORD GET THEM OUT,\nROUNDING THEM OUT AND GETTING THEM OUT OF THE COUNTRY.\nAND NOW HE IS SHIFTING. HE IS SOFTENING, EVEN THOUGH HE\nWENT BACK ON HIS OWN WORD OF SOFTENING, SAYING MAYBE WE'LL DO\nIT IN A DIFFERENT WAY. SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT CHANGE,\nSCOTTIE, THAT HE SAT DOWN WITH LEADERSHIP, AND THEY HAVE\nEXPLAINED TO HIM THAT YOU CAN'T JUST ROUNDUP 11 MILLION PEOPLE\nAT ONCE? >> FROM WHAT I CAN TELL, THAT'S\nWHERE THIS IS COMING FROM. WE HAVE A DEPORTATION FORCE.\nWE HAVE ICE. MR. TRUMP REALIZES THAT THE\nFORCE IS ALREADY THERE, AND IF WE SIT THERE AND CUT YOU'RE\nTHEIR INCENTIVES TO STAY HERE. RIGHT NOW, ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS\nARE COSTING $213 BILLION TO TAXPAYERS RIGHT NOW.\nTHEY'RE NOT PAYING BACK INTO THAT.\nMR. TRUMP IS SAYING WE CANNOT AFFORD THAT ANY MORE DO THAT.\n$213 BILLION WE NEED FOR URBAN DEVELOPMENT, WE NEED IN IT IN\nTHE SCHOOLS AND THE MILITARY. LET'S FIND A WAY TO ENCOURAGE\nTHEM TO GO HOME, BUT COME BACK AND COME BACK AS AMERICAN\nCITIZENS. WE WANT THEM HERE.\nTHAT'S WHY THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL, BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD\nAN IDEA OF WELL COMING THOSE THAT WANT TO BE AMERICANS.\n>> WE SAW HILLARY CLINTON JUMP ON THE COMMENTS THAT DONALD\nTRUMP MADE ABOUT HER BEING A BIGOT AND RUN WITH THOSE\nYESTERDAY. I'M WONDERING, IF THERE WASN'T A\nMISSED OPPORTUNITY HERE TO TALK MORE ABOUT IMMIGRATION POLICY\nAND TO TALK ABOUT THE CHANGE IN WORDS AS WE HEARD FROM SOMEONE\nELSE SAID, WHAT DONALD TRUMP WAS SAYING, THAT IT WAS DIFFERENT.\nDID THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN MISS AN OPPORTUNITY?\n>> NO, SHE DIDN'T. AND SECRETARY CLINTON HAS\nCONSISTENTLY BEEN STRONG ON THE ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION.\nSHE CONTINUES TO TALK ABOUT IT. BUT ACTUALLY, HAS SOME PLANS\nTHAT MAKE SENSE. BUT YOU KNOW, IN THE COURSE OF A\nCAMPAIGN, 74 OR SO DAYS AGO, SOMEBODY CALLS YOU A BIGOT, YOU\nDO HAVE TO RESPOND TO IT. IT REALLY IS MORE DONALD TRUMP\nACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT HIMSELF, WHEN YOU ACTUALLY LOOK UP THE\nDEFINITION, MERRIAM WEBSTER IS A GOOD STORE, HIS LACK OF\nTOLERANCE FOR OTHER PEOPLE AND OTHER PEOPLE'S VIEWS, ESPECIALLY\nAROUND RACE AND RELIGION. AND SO IT IS HIS OWN WORDS THAT\nCONTINUE TO TRIP HIM UP. IT IS DIFFICULT.\nSCOTTIE IS REALLY GOOD, AND I ALWAYS APPRECIATE HER.\nBUT IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT FOR TRUMP SUPPORTERS TO EVER TRULY\nEXPLAIN WHAT IN THE WORLD DONALD TRUMP IS TALKING ABOUT, BECAUSE\nIT CHANGES SO MUCH IN A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.\nSO IT IS REALLY HARD FOR FOLKS TO KEEP UP WITH WHAT HE IS\nTALKING ABOUT. THE REALITY IS, HE DOESN'T KNOW\nWHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT AND HE IS MAKING IT UP AS HE GOES\nALONG. YES, I'M SOFTENING.\nNO, I MAY BE HARDENING. IT IS KIND OF HARD TO DO IN A\n12-HOUR PERIOD OF TIME. HE HAS NO IDEA WHAT IMMIGRATION\nIS REALLY ALL ABOUT. IT IS NOT LIKE FOLKS FILING OUT\nOF A MOVIE THEATER AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO LET THEM BACK IN\nFOR THE NEXT SHOW. IT IS 11 MILLION PEOPLE, WHO\nHAVE VARIOUS COMPLICATIONS IN THEIR LIVES, WHICH REALLY BEGS\nTHE POINTS, WHAT IS THE POINT IN THE FIRST PLACE.\nTHE FOLKS ARE HERE. THEY HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING.\nTHEIR CHILDREN ARE HERE. THEY ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS, IN\nFACT. WHAT IS THE POINT OF, YOU KNOW,\nKIND OF SENDING THEM OUT, AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO BRING THEM\nBACK IN AND DO OUR BEST OR WHATEVER.\nHE HAS NO IDEA WHAT GOVERNANCE IS ALL ABOUT.\nIT IS DEMONSTRATED ON THE NATIONAL STAGE EACH AND\nEVERYDAY. >> I WANT YOU BOTH TO STICK\nAROUND. WE HAVE MORE TO DISCUSS.\nWE DO NEED TO TAKE A QUICK",

HE IS A HILLARY CLINTON\nSUPPORTER. >> KAYLEIGH, YOU HEARD THOSE\nCOMMENTS AND NOT THE FIRST TIME WE TALKED ABOUT IT TODAY.\nHOW IS THIS NOT A BACKTRACK ON THE BACKTRACK?\n>> WELL, IF YOU LISTEN SPECIFICALLY TO WHAT DONALD\nTRUMP SAID IN THE SECOND SOUND BITE TO SEAN HANNITY, HE SAID I\nLISTEN TO VOTERS AND VOTERS TELL ME I'M TOO HARB ON THIS POLICY.\nTHEY WANT ME TO SOFTEN IT. HE NEVER COMMITTED TO NOT\nDEPORTING 11 MILLION PEOPLE. HE WAS LISTENING TO VOTERS AND\nTHAT'S A GOOD THING AND HE DOUBLED DOWN IS THAT HE WANTS\nIMMIGRANTS TO BE HERE AND HE LIKES IMMIGRANTS AND WANTS THEM\nTO BE A PART OF THE COMMUNITY, BUT HE DOES BELIEVE IN THE RULE\nOF LAW. >> BASIL, DO YOU BUY THAT?\n>> I DON'T. WE CAN DEBATE THE PARTICULARS OF\nIMMIGRATION POLICY AND IMMIGRATION REFORM, BUT THE FACT\nI WANT TO HONE IN ON HERE IS THAT HE DIDOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'\nDOING. DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT KNOW WHAT\nHE'S DOING WITH RESPECT TO IMMIGRATION AND HIS REPUBLICAN\nCOLLEAGUES WHO HE VANQUISHED OFF THE STAGE DURING THE DEBATES\nHAD, EVEN THOUGH I MAY DISAGREE, SOME KIND OF IDEA OF WHAT\nIMMIGRATION REFORM SHOULD LOOK LIKE AND BE LIKE.\nHE -- HE PUTS THEM OFF THE STAGE BY BASICALLY TAKING A FAR,\nHARDER LINE ON IMMIGRATION RETOMORROW THAN ANY OF THEM HAD.\nHE STUCK TO THAT AND DUG IN HIS HEELS MUCH DEEPER THAN ANY OF\nTHEM HEAD FOR A GOOD CHUNK OF HIS CAMPAIGN, BUT WE'RE 75, 76\nDAYS OUT AND HIS IMMIGRATION POLICY IS TO BE DETERMINED,\nQUOTE, UNQUOTE FROM HIS CAMPAIGN MANAGER AND TO ME, THAT SIGNALS\nTHAT HE REALLY DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE WANTS TO DO, BUT WHAT HE DOES\nWANT TO DO IS WIN, AND TO ME THAT IS WANT SOUND POLICY NO\nMATTER WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE.\n>> YOU HEARD OUR JASON CARROLL WHO HAS BEEN TALKING TO VOTERS\nON THE CAMPAIGN WHO SAY IF HE PUSHES AND BACKTRACKS ON THIS HE\nWILL LOSE MY SUPPORT. HOW MUCH OF A CONCERN IS THAT\nFOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN? >> I'M SURE IT IS A CONCERN AND\nTRUMP SUPPORTERS, THOSE THAT OPPOSE HIM ON IMMIGRATION REFORM\nARE STILL GOING TO GO WITH MR. TRUMP.\nTHEY'RE VERY LOYAL TO MR. TRUMP. I DON'T THINK THEY'LL LEAVE HIM\nOR STOP SUPPORTING HIS MIND ON HOW TO DEAL WITH THE\nUNDOCUMENTED. >> THIS IS NOT A FRINGE ISSUE\nFOR THE CAMPAIGN. IT'S A DEFINING ISSUE FOR DONALD\nTRUMP'S CAMPAIGN FROM THE BEGINNING.\n>> WELL, BUT FROM THE BEGINNING AND LET ME SAY, I THINK ON THIS\nISSUE SPECIFICALLY ON THE UNDOCUMENTED HE HAS BEEN\nCONSISTENT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING HE SAID I WANT PEOPLE\nTO LEAVE THE COUNTRY. THE GOOD PEOPLE.\nTHOSE WHO HAVE NO CRIMINAL RECORD WOULD BE ALLOWED TO\nRETURN. >> THE THING IS YESTERDAY IN THE\nINTERVIEW -- >> NO, NO, NO.\nLET'S BE CLEAR. HE'S ALWAYS SAID IT FROM THE\nVERY BEGINNING. >> GOOD OR BAD, THEY HAVE TO GO.\n>> SO THE QUESTION IS, DOES THAT HAPPEN -- THE PEOPLE WITHOUT\nCRIMINAL RIDICULOUS, DO THEY HAVE TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY OR\nCOULD THEY -- AND THEN COME BACK OR CAN THEY DO THE TOUCHBACK\nINSIDE THE COUNTRY, GOING TO AN EMBASSY OR A CONSULATE.\nIF THAT'S THE CASE, THEN IT'S NOT A MAJOR REVERSAL.\nIT'S AN ADJUSTMENT OF HIS POSITION.\n>> I'LL GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE.\nTED CRUZ SUPPORTER WHO HOLDS A VERY SIMILAR POSITION TO WHAT\nWE'RE HEARING NOW FROM DONALD TRUMP.\nYOU PREDICTED DONALD TRUMP'S POSITIONS WOULD CHANGE.\n>> HERE'S THE THING AND THE THING THAT MAKES ME WANT TO PUT\nMY HEAD THROUGH THIS GLASS TABLE IS REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN\nFIGHTING ABOUT THE WORD AMNESTY SINCE ABOUT 2006 WHEN WE HAD THE\nFIRST COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM BILL.\nWHAT DOES AMNESTY MEAN? EVERYONE SAYS THEY'RE AGAINST IT\nAND CONSERVATIVES AND PEOPLE ATTRACTED TO DONALD TRUMP'S HARD\nLINE IMMIGRATION MESSAGE HAS DEFINED AMNESTY AS BOTH\nCITIZENSHIP AND LEGAL STATUS AND TOUCHBACK AMNESTY WHERE PEOPLE\nARE ALLOWED TO VOLUNTARILY LEAVE THE COUNTRY, GO BACK HOME AND\nTHEY HAVE SOME KIND OF LEGAL STATUS.\nWE DON'T KNOW WHAT TRUMP MEANS AND THEY'LL JUST LEAVE.\nWE DON'T KNOW HOW THEY'RE GOING TO LEAVE AND COME BACK.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS TO FORGET WHAT HIS POLICY IS.\nHE HAS TO BE PRESSED ON WHAT HE BELIEVES AMNESTY IS, BECAUSE A\nLOT OF PEOPLE AMONG HIS BASE SUPPORTERS THINK ANY KIND OF\nLEGAL STATUS IS AMNESTY BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE DEBATE HAS\nFOCUSED NOW. >> YOU'RE A TRUMP SUPPORTER, ARE\nYOU CONCERNED THAT THIS IS CONFUSING FOR EVEN TRUMP\nSUPPORTERS? >> I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT\nWE UNDERSTAND THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE SHOULD BE DICTATING THE\nPOLICIES AND NOT JUST AN INDIVIDUAL.\nWE ARE AS THE AMERICANS SHOULD BE DICTATING WHAT WE WANT OUR\nCANDIDATE TO DO, AND THAT'S WHAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS DONE, AND\nHAS FORGOTTEN THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE AND CREATED WHATEVER SHE\nWANTS TO DO, SAY AT HIDE AND WHATEVER SHE WANTS TO HIDE.\n>> I DID ASK YOU ABOUT TRUMP'S POSITION.\n>> BUT -- IT'S THE SAME BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TRUMP\nFLIP-FLOPPING. TRUMP IS NOT FLIP-FLOPPING.\nTRUMP IS LISTENING TO THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE.\nTHE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE IS -- IS -- IS THE MOUTHPIECE OF WHICH\nDONALD TRUMP IS ECHOING TO THE WORLD.\nSO IF -- IF -- IF THE PEOPLE ARE TELLING DONALD TRUMP YOU'RE\nBEING TOO HARD IT IS RIGHT FOR ANY CANDIDATE TO SAY --\n>> THAT'S AWESOME. WE WILL HAVE MORE TIME LATER.\n>> THE PROBLEM WITH THIS DEBATE AND WE'RE DEALING WITH A CON MAN\nAND THE FIRST THING DONALD TRUMP TRIED TO DO IN THE PRIMARIES WAS\nCON CONSERVATIVE VOTERS AND THE REPUBLICANS.\nONCE HE FINISHED WITH THAT HE HAD TO DEAL WITH THE GENERAL\nELECTORATE AND NOW HE'S TRYING TO CON THOSE PEOPLE THAT\nBASICALLY REJECTED HIM. DONALD TRUMP IS LOSING THIS\nELECTION BY A SLAND SLIDE AND NOW THEY'RE LOOKING AROUND WITH\nA NEW ADVISER AND SAYING HOW DO WE NOW CON THE ELECTORATE TO\nBELIEVE THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY NOT RACIST AND THAT WE'RE NOT TRYING\nTO CON PEOPLE AND THROW PEOPLE OUT OF THE COUNTRY.\n>> WE HAVE THE LUXURY OF TIME TONIGHT AND WE ARE GOING TO COME\nBACK.

JUST MOMENTS AGO, TRUMP APPEARED\nTO FLIP-FLOP ON HIS IMMIGRATION FLIP-FLOP.\nHERE'S WHAT THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE SAID TO\nANDERSON COOPER. >> IF THEY HAVEN'T COMMITTED A\nCRIME, IS THERE GOING TO BE A PATH TO LEGALIZATION?\nI'M TALKING ABOUT CITIZENSHIP. >> THERE IS NO PATH TO\nLEGALIZATION. >> UNLESS PEOPLE LEAVE THE\nCOUNTRY -- WELL, WHEN THEY COME BACK IN, IF THEY COME BACK IN\nTHEN THEY CAN START PAYING TAXES.\n>> SO THEY STILL HAVE TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY?\n>> THERE IS NO PATH TO LEGALIZATION UNLESS THEY LEAVE\nTHE COUNTRY AND COME BACK. >> THIS COMES LESS THAN 24 HOURS\nAFTER DONALD TRUMP SAID THIS. >> THEY'LL PAY BACK TAXES.\nTHEY HAVE TO PAY TAXES. THERE'S NO AMNESTY AS SUCH.\nTHERE'S NO AMNESTY. >> RIGHT.\n>> BUT WE WORK WITH THEM. NOW, OKAY, BUT WHEN I LOOK AT\nTHE ROOMS AND I HAVE THIS ALL OVER, AND EVERYBODY AGREES WE\nGET THE BAD ONES OUT, BUT WHEN I GO THROUGH AND I MEET THOUSANDS\nAND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ON THE SUBJECT, AND I'VE HAD VERY\nSTRONG PEOPLE COME UP TO ME, REALLY GREAT, GREAT PEOPLE COME\nUP TO ME, AND THEY'VE SAID, MR. TRUMP, I LOVE YOU, BUT TO TAKE A\nPERSON WHO HAS BEEN HERE FOR 15, 20 YEARS AND TO THROW THEM AND\nTHE FAMILY OUT IS SO TOUGH, MR. TRUMP.\nI HAVE IT ALL OF THE TIME. IT'S A VERY, VERY HARD THING.\n>> KEEP IN MIND, FOR THE LAST YEAR OF HIS PRESIDENTIAL RUN,\nDONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN SAYING THIS.\n>> YOU'LL HAVE TO SEND PEOPLE OUT.\nI WOULD GET PEOPLE OUT, AND I WOULD HAVE AN EXPEDITED WAY OF\nGETTING THEM BACK INTO THE COUNTRY SO THEY CAN BE LEGAL.\nTHEY'VE GOT TO GO OUT. >> BUT HOW DO YOU DO IT IN A\nPRACTICAL WAY? >> THEY'VE GOT TO LEAVE.\n>> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A DEPORTATION FORCE.\n>> JASON CARROLL OUT FRONT TONIGHT.\nTRUMP APPEARS TO BE BACKTRACKING ON HIS IMMIGRATION BACKTRACK.\nYOU ARE FOLLOWING THE CAMPAIGN VERY CLOSELY.\nWHAT'S GOING ON HERE? >> Reporter: WELL, IT'S A GOOD\nQUESTION. LOOK, HERE'S WHAT I CAN TELL YOU\nAND I'VE LISTENED TO A NUMBER OF THAT SOUND AND PEOPLE HAVE HEARD\nTHESE DIFFERENT SORT OF POSITIONS THAT TRUMP HAS HAD ON\nTHIS ISSUE. LOOK, I THINK WHAT WE'RE GOING\nTO GET FROM THE CAMPAIGN IS THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN CONSISTENT\nIN ONE WAY. HE'S BEEN CONSISTENT IN SAYING\nNO AMNESTY, NO PATH TO CITIZENSHIP, BUT JIM, WHAT IS\nCLEAR HERE IS THAT IT'S NOT CLEAR AND THE ONLY ONE WHO\nSEEMINGLY CAN CLEAR IT UP IS DONALD TRUMP.\nWHEN IT COMES TO IMMIGRATION, DONALD TRUMP IS STILL TALKING\nTOUGH. >> IF YOU WANT TO HAVE STRONG\nBORDERS, SO THAT PEOPLE COME INTO OUR COUNTRY, BUT THEY COME\nIN LEGALLY THROUGH A LEGAL PROCESS, THAT DOESN'T MAKE YOU A\nRACIST. IT MAKES YOU SMART.\n>> BUT TRUMP NOW SIGNALING HE MIGHT BE RECONSIDERING HIS\nPLEDGE TO DEPORT ALL OF THE ESTIMATED 11 MILLION\nUNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS CURRENTLY IN THE UNITED STATES.\n>> NO CITIZENSHIP. NO CITIZENSHIP.\n>> EVERYONE AGREE WITH THAT? >> YEAH.\n>> ALL",

JUST MOMENTS BEFORE CLINTON\nATTACKED TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN ON THE ISSUE, TRUMP ATTEMPTING TO TURN\nTHE TABLES. >> SHE LIES.\nSHE LIES AND SHE SMEARS, AND SHE PAINTS DECENT AMERICANS, YOU, AS\nRACISTS. SHE BULLY VOTERS WHO ONLY WANT A\nBETTER FUTURE AND TRIES TO INTIMIDATE THEM OUT OF VOTING\nFOR A CHANGE. I'M FOR CHANGE.\nSHE DOESN'T WANT CHANGE. >> Reporter: THE GOP NOMINEE\nALSO STEPPING UP HIS OUTREACH TO MINORITY VOTERS HOSTING A\nROUNDTABLE WITH BLACK AND LATINO VOTERS.\nTHIS COMING AFTER TRUMP DEPLOYED THIS HARSH CRITIQUE OF HIS\nOPPONENT OVERNIGHT. >> HILLARY CLINTON IS A BIGOT\nWHO SEES PEOPLE OF COLOR OOMP ARE\nONLY AS VOTES, NOT AS HUMAN BEINGINGS.\n>> Reporter: THE COMMENTS EVEN APPEARING TO SHOCK THIS WOMAN\nSITTING BEHIND HIM. EVEN AS TRUMP TRIES TO REBRAND\nHILLARY CLINTON, HE'S FACING QUESTIONS ABOUT A DEFINING PIECE\nOF HIS OWN BRAND, IMMIGRATION. TODAY, TRUMP PLEDGED A STRONG\nIMMIGRATION POLICY. >> FIRST OF ALL, WE HAVE NO\nCHOICE. >> Reporter: OVERNIGHT HE\nAPPEARED TO BE SOFTENED HIS HARD LINE STANCE.\nONE THAT FUELED HIS RISE. >> THEY'LL HAVE TO PAY TAXES.\nTHERE'S NO AMNESTY AS SUCH. THERE'S NO AMNESTY.\nWE WORK WITH THEM.

THIS IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT\nFROM WHAT HE SAID YESTERDAY. >> IT IS.\nWE SHOULD MAKE CLEAR, HE HASN'T ROLLED OUT THE IMMIGRATION\nPOLICY THAT HE'S GOING TO RUN ON IN THE FALL ELECTION.\nTHIS IS BAIT LIKE TRYING TO PIN JELL-O TO THE WALL.\nWE DON'T KNOW WHERE HE'S GOING TO LAND.\nWHAT WE'RE SEEING IS SOMEBODY GOING THROUGH A VERY PUBLIC\nSEARCHING OF TRYING TO ALTER HIS POLICY TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE\nHE THINKS HE'LL BE ABLE TO WIN OVER A BROADER SWATH OF VOTERS.\nIT WAS QUITE CLEAR TO ME, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FELT BUT\nLISTENING TO HIM THIS WEEK, ESPECIALLY LAST NIGHT WITH SEAN\nHANNITY, HE WAS VERY OPEN TO THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME QUOTE,\nUNQUOTE, GOOD ONES. PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN HERE FOR\n20 YEARS AND HAVE FAMILY TIES TO STAY IN THE COUNTRY.\nBAY BACK TAXES WHICH HE SAYS WOULD ERADICATE THE NEED TO CALL\nIT AMNESTY BUT -- >> ALTHOUGH MANY CONSERVATIVES\nWOULD DISAGREE. >> THIS IS WHAT HE WAS SAYING\nLAST NIGHT, TO MY EAR, IS HE WAS OPENING TO THAT.\nTODAY, SAYING YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO YOUR COUNTRY FIRST.\nTHAT'S BACK TO WHERE HE WAS IN THE NOMINATION SEASON.\n>> THIS IS WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT THE CANDIDATE TO DO SIX MONTHS\nAGO, EIGHT MONTHS AGO BEFORE THEY GET INTO THE RACE, HAMMER\nTHIS STUFF OUT. THE PROBLEM IS SHE HAS NOW EIGHT\nMONTHS OF PUBLIC STATEMENTS AND THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS DEALING\nWITH CANDIDATE WHO HAS NOTHING ON PAPER.\nTHEY CAN MAKE HIS IMMIGRATION POLICY WHATEVER THEY WANT IT TO\nBE. THEY WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE IT\nABOUT DEPORTATIONS FOR AS LONG AS THEY POSSIBLE CAN.\nBY THE LOOKING OF IT, THIS ISN'T BEING HAMMERED OUT ANY TIME\nSOON. COULD BE QUITE SOME TIME.\n>> WE THINK WE'LL HEAR ABOUT THIS NEXT WEEK, RIGHT?\n>> I THINK THEY WANT TO STALL THIS OUT AND SEE HOLD UP IT\nPLAYS OUT. >> THESE ARE ALL TRIAL BALLOONS.\n>> GOT TO BE. EARLIER THIS WEEK HE WALKED UP\nAS CLOSE AS HE COULD TO THE LINE OF SAYING AMNESTY WITHOUT USING\nTHE WORD BUT IN LAST COUPLE OF DAYS, HE'S KIND OF LOSING ANN\nCOULTER. NOW I THINK SOMEONE IS IN HIS\nEAR SAYING HE'S GOT TO REEL IT BACK.\nPEOPLE MAY BE ABLE TO GET LEGALIZATION BUT THEY'LL HAVE TO\nLEAVE THE COUNTRY FIRST. >> WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE EARLIER\nIS HE WAS LEARNING ABOUT IMMIGRATION REALTIME, PUBLICLY.\nHE SEEMED ASTONISHED BY THE FACT.\nHER BOOK CAME OUT AND SAID THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD DRIVE\nTRUMP SUPPORTERS. WHEN THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT,IC HE\nHAD SORT OF A HEART ATTACK PUBLICLY.\n>> IT WOULD BE CHANGING HIS MIND ON THE THING HE BUILT HIS\nCAMPAIGN ON. >> HE USED THE WORD HIMSELF, HIS\nOWN WORD WAS SOFTENING. I CAN'T POINT TO WHAT IS THE\nSOFTENING HE THOUGHT HE WAS REFERRING TO IF HIS POSITION IS\nBACK TO DEPORTING EVERYBODY FIRST.\n>> IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO STOP TRUMP FROM WANTING TO DO\nTHE THING THAT GOT HIM HERE. >> EXACTLY.\nWANTING TO DO WHAT TRUMP WANTS TO DO.\nLET TRUMP BE TRUMP.

I HEARD DONALD TRUMP RIGHT THERE\nIN THAT SOUND BITE SAY THIS ISN'T ABOUT AMNESTY.\nBUT, YOU KNOW, IN THIS SENSE, IS AMNESTY ONLY ABOUT CITIZENSHIP?\nTALK TO ME. >> WHAT IT IS, IS I UNDERSTAND\nWHAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS TRYING TO DO.\nTHEY'RE TRYING TO SOFTEN THE RHETORIC.\nTHEY'RE TRYING TO PIVOT FOR A GENERAL ELECTION, AND I GET\nTHAT. BUT THE CHALLENGE I THINK EXISTS\nHERE IS THE PROMISES THAT DONALD TRUMP MADE DURING THE PRIMARY\nAND WHAT THAT IS NOW BECOMING FOR THE GENERAL ELECTION.\nAND THIS IS WHAT'S WRONG WITH POLITICS, AND FRANKLY IT'S WHY\nDONALD TRUMP IS THE NOMINEE. IT'S BECAUSE THE REPUBLICAN\nPRIMARY ELECTORATE WAS SO TIRED OF ELECTING SOMEONE WHO PROMISED\nSOMETHING AND THEN PIVOTED TO A SOFTER POSITION IN THE GENERAL\nELECTION OR, EVEN WORSE, DID NOTHING AT ALL ONCE THEY GOT\nELECTED. AND TRUMP CAMPAIGNED AGAINST\nTHAT. HE TOOK STRONG STANDS AGAINST\nIT. HE DID A GREAT JOB OF TAPPING\nINTO AN ANGRY REPUBLICAN PRIMARY ELECTORATE.\nNOW HE'S DOING WHAT THE PEOPLE WHO ELECTED HIM ARE ANGRY ABOUT,\nWHICH IS CHANGING THE POSITION. I THINK POLITICALLY IT'S A SMART\nTHING FOR HIM TO DO. >> WHY ISN'T THAT GOOD ENOUGH,\nTHEN? IF POLITICALLY, THE RIGHT\nDECISION, YOU'D WANT TO GO WITH THE POLITICALLY CORRECT\nDECISION, WOULDN'T YOU? >> NOT NECESSARILY.\nI THINK SOMETIMES YOU MAKE A PROMISE TO VOTERS, AND THERE'S\nVALUE IN LIVING UP TO THAT. THAT'S WHAT SENATOR CRUZ.\nHE SAID DONALD TRUMP WAS FOOLING THE VOTERS.\nHE WAS TRYING TO TAKE THE BRAND AND SLAP HIS BRAND ON THE\nPOLITICAL PROCESS THE SAME WAY HE DID IN WATER AND STEAKS AND\nWINE AND EVERYTHING ELSE. IT FALLS APART.\nTHAT'S WHAT HAPPENED HERE. THE PROMISES HE MADE TO THE --\n>> JACK, IS CHRIS RIGHT IN SAYING HE CAME OUT WITH A\nPLATFORM EARLY IN THE CAMPAIGN, AND HE HAS TO STICK WITH IT ALL\nTHE WAY THROUGH THE GENERAL ELECTION?\n>> I THINK HE IS STICKING WITH IT.\nI THINK HE'S BEEN CONSISTENT ON A COUPLE OF VERY, VERY IMPORTANT\nPOINTS. NUMBER ONE, ENFORCING EXISTING\nLAWS, WHICH BY THE WAY IS GOING TO DRY UP THE JOB MAGNETS\nBECAUSE THAT MEANS EMPLOYERS NEED TO QUIT HIRING ILLEGALS.\nNUMBER TWO, HE'S BEEN VERY CONSISTENT ABOUT A WALL, MAYBE\nNOT BRICKS AND MORTARS, BUT A WALL THAT WILL KEEP PEOPLE FROM\nCOMING INTO THE BORDER ILLEGALLY.\nAND NUMBER THREE, NO AMNESTY, WHICH IS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST\nISSUE WITH THE REPUBLICAN BASE. HILLARY CLINTON IS A PRO-AM\nNESSTY PERSON. ANOTHER PART OF THIS IS\nPROTECTING AMERICAN JOBS BECAUSE HE HAS SAID REPEATEDLY THAT\nILLEGALS UNDERCUT -- >> EVERYONE SAYS THAT, THOUGH.\nTHAT'S PRETTY CONSISTENT ALL ALONG THE GOP, THE LINE, IS THAT\nILLEGALS TAKE JOBS AWAY FROM AMERICANS.\nTALK TO ME, JACK. YOU JUST SAID -- YOU SAID TWO\nTHINGS PROVOCATIVELY, THAT NOT NECESSARILY BRICKS AND MORTAR\nWALL. I DO THIS FOR A LIVING HERE, AND\nI THOUGHT IT WAS A BRICKS AND MORTAR WALL, NUMBER ONE.\nAND, NUMBER TWO, WHEN YOU SAY NO AMNESTY AND YOU LET ILLEGALS\nSTAY, ISN'T THAT A FORM OF AMNESTY?\n>> WELL, LET ME ADDRESS THE WALL FIRST.\nAS YOU KNOW, THE WALL HAS BEEN VOTED ON MANY TIMES FOR MANY\nYEARS BY MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE. IT'S BEEN KILLED IN THE SENATE.\nBUT I THINK IN SOME AREAS, IT IS TOTALLY SUFFICIENT TO HAVE A\nCYBERWALL. BUT HE HAS BEEN PRETTY\nCONSISTENT ABOUT A WALL, A WALL, A WALL.\nSO I DON'T THINK HE'S BACKING OFF OF THAT WHATSOEVER.\nNUMBER TWO, ON AMNESTY, HE'S SAYING NO AMNESTY.\nBUT HE'S ALSO SAYING LET'S DO THIS IN A HUMANE AND ORDERLY\nWAY. SO HE WANTS TO GET THE BAD\nACTORS OUT AND START WITH THEM, AND THEN MOVE DOWN THE LINE.\nI THINK WITHOUT THE JOBS HERE, BECAUSE YOU'RE ENFORCING\nEXISTING LAWS, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE LESS MOTIVATION FOR PEOPLE\nTO WANT TO COME HERE OR TO STAY HERE BECAUSE THE LAWS SAY YOU\nCAN'T BE HERE. >> CHRIS, I'M GOING TO TAKE A\nLITTLE ISSUE WITH YOU HERE. LOOK, YOU GUYS ON THE LEFT --\nNOT ON THE LEFT. I'M THE LEFT.\nBUT ALSO THE NO TRUMP PEOPLE HAVE SAID, LOOK, HE'S DOING IT\nWRONG. THIS IS TOO HARD CORE FOR THE\nGOP. THE GOP NEEDS TO ENCOMPASS MORE\nDIVERSITY, AND NOW HE SAYS, I'M AT LEAST THINKING ABOUT\nSOFTENING MY STANCE. AND NOW YOU DON'T LIKE IT THIS\nWAY EITHER. >> FIRST OF ALL, LET ME BE\nCLEAR.

THEY HAVE TO PAY TAXES.\nTHERE'S NO AMNESTY. THERE'S NO AMNESTY.\nBUT WE WORK WITH THEM. NOW, OKAY.\nWHEN I LOOK AT THE -- I HAD THIS ALL OVER.\nEVERYBODY AGREES WE GET THE BAD ONES OUT.\nBUT WHEN I GO THROUGH AND I MEET THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF\nPEOPLE ON THE SUBJECT, AND I'VE HAD VERY STRONG PEOPLE COME UP\nTO ME, REALLY GREAT, GREAT PEOPLE COME UP TO ME.\nAND THEY'VE SAID, MR. TRUMP, I LOVE YOU.\nBUT TO TAKE A PERSON THAT'S BEEN HERE FOR 15 OR 20 YEARS AND\nTHROW THEM AND THE FAMILY OUT, IT'S SO TOUGH, MR. TRUMP.\nI MEAN I HAVE IT ALL THE TIME. IT'S A VERY, VERY HARD THING.\n>> TRUMP IS APPEARING TO BACK AWAY FROM HIS PREVIOUS CALLS TO\nDEPORT ALL ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FROM THE COUNTRY.\nBUT WILL THIS HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT WITH HIS VOTERS.\nJOINING US WITH REACTION, CHRIS WILSON, FORMER ADVISOR TO THE\nCRUZ PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, ALONG WITH JACK KINGSTON, A\nSENIOR ADVISOR TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.\nCHRIS, YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS. I HEARD DONALD TRUMP RIGHT THERE\nIN THAT SOUND BITE SAY THIS ISN'T ABOUT AMNESTY.\nBUT, YOU KNOW, IN THIS SENSE, IS AMNESTY ONLY ABOUT CITIZENSHIP?\nTALK TO ME. >> WHAT IT IS, IS I UNDERSTAND\nWHAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS TRYING TO DO.\nTHEY'RE TRYING TO SOFTEN THE RHETORIC.\nTHEY'RE TRYING TO PIVOT FOR A GENERAL ELECTION, AND I GET\nTHAT. BUT THE CHALLENGE I THINK EXISTS\nHERE IS THE PROMISES THAT DONALD TRUMP MADE DURING THE PRIMARY\nAND WHAT THAT IS NOW BECOMING FOR THE GENERAL ELECTION.\nAND THIS IS WHAT'S WRONG WITH POLITICS, AND FRANKLY IT'S WHY\nDONALD TRUMP IS THE NOMINEE. IT'S BECAUSE THE REPUBLICAN\nPRIMARY ELECTORATE WAS SO TIRED OF ELECTING SOMEONE WHO PROMISED\nSOMETHING AND THEN PIVOTED TO A SOFTER POSITION IN THE GENERAL\nELECTION OR, EVEN WORSE, DID NOTHING AT ALL ONCE THEY GOT\nELECTED. AND TRUMP CAMPAIGNED AGAINST\nTHAT. HE TOOK STRONG STANDS AGAINST\nIT. HE DID A GREAT JOB OF TAPPING\nINTO AN ANGRY REPUBLICAN PRIMARY ELECTORATE.\nNOW HE'S DOING WHAT THE PEOPLE WHO ELECTED HIM ARE ANGRY ABOUT,\nWHICH IS CHANGING THE POSITION. I THINK POLITICALLY IT'S A SMART\nTHING FOR HIM TO DO. >> WHY ISN'T THAT GOOD ENOUGH,\nTHEN? IF POLITICALLY, THE RIGHT\nDECISION, YOU'D WANT TO GO WITH THE POLITICALLY CORRECT\nDECISION, WOULDN'T YOU? >> NOT NECESSARILY.\nI THINK SOMETIMES YOU MAKE A PROMISE TO VOTERS, AND THERE'S\nVALUE IN LIVING UP TO THAT. THAT'S WHAT SENATOR CRUZ.\nHE SAID DONALD TRUMP WAS FOOLING THE VOTERS.\nHE WAS TRYING TO TAKE THE BRAND AND SLAP HIS BRAND ON THE\nPOLITICAL PROCESS THE SAME WAY HE DID IN WATER AND STEAKS AND\nWINE AND EVERYTHING ELSE. IT FALLS APART.\nTHAT'S WHAT HAPPENED HERE. THE PROMISES HE MADE TO THE --\n>> JACK, IS CHRIS RIGHT IN SAYING HE CAME OUT WITH A\nPLATFORM EARLY IN THE CAMPAIGN, AND HE HAS TO STICK WITH IT ALL\nTHE WAY THROUGH THE GENERAL ELECTION?\n>> I THINK HE IS STICKING WITH IT.\nI THINK HE'S BEEN CONSISTENT ON A COUPLE OF VERY, VERY IMPORTANT\nPOINTS. NUMBER ONE, ENFORCING EXISTING\nLAWS, WHICH BY THE WAY IS GOING TO DRY UP THE JOB MAGNETS\nBECAUSE THAT MEANS EMPLOYERS NEED TO QUIT HIRING ILLEGALS.\nNUMBER TWO, HE'S BEEN VERY CONSISTENT ABOUT A WALL, MAYBE\nNOT BRICKS AND MORTARS, BUT A WALL THAT WILL KEEP PEOPLE FROM\nCOMING INTO THE BORDER ILLEGALLY.\nAND NUMBER THREE, NO AMNESTY, WHICH IS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST\nISSUE WITH THE REPUBLICAN BASE. HILLARY CLINTON IS A PRO-AM\nNESSTY PERSON. ANOTHER PART OF THIS IS\nPROTECTING AMERICAN JOBS BECAUSE HE HAS SAID REPEATEDLY THAT\nILLEGALS UNDERCUT -- >> EVERYONE SAYS THAT, THOUGH.\nTHAT'S PRETTY CONSISTENT ALL ALONG THE GOP, THE LINE, IS THAT\nILLEGALS TAKE JOBS AWAY FROM AMERICANS.\nTALK TO ME, JACK. YOU JUST SAID -- YOU SAID TWO\nTHINGS PROVOCATIVELY, THAT NOT NECESSARILY BRICKS AND MORTAR\nWALL. I DO THIS FOR A LIVING HERE, AND\nI THOUGHT IT WAS A BRICKS AND MORTAR WALL, NUMBER ONE.\nAND, NUMBER TWO, WHEN YOU SAY NO AMNESTY AND YOU LET ILLEGALS\nSTAY, ISN'T THAT A FORM OF AMNESTY?\n>> WELL, LET ME ADDRESS THE WALL FIRST.\nAS YOU KNOW, THE WALL HAS BEEN VOTED ON MANY TIMES FOR MANY\nYEARS BY MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE. IT'S BEEN KILLED IN THE SENATE.\nBUT I THINK IN SOME AREAS, IT IS TOTALLY SUFFICIENT TO HAVE A\nCYBERWALL. BUT HE HAS BEEN PRETTY\nCONSISTENT ABOUT A WALL, A WALL, A WALL.\nSO I DON'T THINK HE'S BACKING OFF OF THAT WHATSOEVER.\nNUMBER TWO, ON AMNESTY, HE'S SAYING NO AMNESTY.\nBUT HE'S ALSO SAYING LET'S DO THIS IN A HUMANE AND ORDERLY\nWAY. SO HE WANTS TO GET THE BAD\nACTORS OUT AND START WITH THEM, AND THEN MOVE DOWN THE LINE.\nI THINK WITHOUT THE JOBS HERE, BECAUSE YOU'RE ENFORCING\nEXISTING LAWS, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE LESS MOTIVATION FOR PEOPLE\nTO WANT TO COME HERE OR TO STAY HERE BECAUSE THE LAWS SAY YOU\nCAN'T BE HERE. >> CHRIS, I'M GOING TO TAKE A\nLITTLE ISSUE WITH YOU HERE. LOOK, YOU GUYS ON THE LEFT --\nNOT ON THE LEFT. I'M THE LEFT.\nBUT ALSO THE NO TRUMP PEOPLE HAVE SAID, LOOK, HE'S DOING IT\nWRONG. THIS IS TOO HARD CORE FOR THE\nGOP. THE GOP NEEDS TO ENCOMPASS MORE\nDIVERSITY, AND NOW HE SAYS, I'M AT LEAST THINKING ABOUT\nSOFTENING MY STANCE. AND NOW YOU DON'T LIKE IT THIS\nWAY EITHER. >> FIRST OF ALL, LET ME BE\nCLEAR. I'M NOT NEVER TRUMP.\nI WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nWHAT I CAN'T VOTE FOR IS SOMEONE WHO TAKES A POSITION ON --\n>> WHAT IS IT, CHRIS? YOU JUST SAID, I'D LIKE TO VOTE\nFOR TRUMP. WHAT'S THE ISSUE WITH TRUMP YOU\nCAN'T VOTE FOR HIM? >> BECAUSE I DON'T THINK HE'S A\nCONSERVATIVE. I THINK HE DID EXACTLY WHAT HE\nWAS ACCUSED OF DOING IN THE PRIMARY WHEN HE DID THE SECRET\nMEETING WITH \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\"S THAT WAS TAPED.\nHE MADE THE COMMENT THIS IS ALL AN ACT.\nI WILL NEVER DO THIS. I WON'T BUILD A WALL.\nTHIS IS ALL SOMETHING I'M SAYING BECAUSE I HAVE TO WIN A PRIMARY.\nTO ME, THAT IS WHAT IS WRONG WITH POLITICS.\nIF THAT IS HOW DONALD TRUMP WON THE NOMINATION, UNDER FALSE\nPRETENSIONS, NO, HE SHOULDN'T BE ELECTED PRESIDENT.\n>> GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nWHEN WE COME RIGHT BACK, CAN DONALD TRUMP SUCCESSFULLY EXTEND\nHIS OUTREACH TO MINORITIES AND WOMEN?\nDANA PERINO HAS SOME VERY PROVOCATIVE THOUGHTS ON THAT\nUPCOMING.",

NOW HE TELLS US, THE LAWS ARE\nWONDERFUL, I DON'T WANT TO CHANGE ANY OF IT.\nI'LL BE A LITTLE MORE ENERGETIC. THAT UNDERMINES ANYTHING HE'S\nEVER SAID AND YOU HAVE TO QUESTION, DID HE EVER MEAN IT?\n>> SO QUITE A TURN ABOUT, GREG? >> HE CAVED MORE THAN A SEASONED\nSPELUNKER. >> I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.\n>> I SAID THIS YESTERDAY, IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS GOING TO\nCHANGE HIS MIND, IT'S ON YOU. BECAUSE HE CHANGES HIS POSITION\nMORE THAN AN OLYMPIC GYMNAST. HE TURNED INTO JEB BUSH JUST\nNOW. REMEMBER, TED CRUZ WARNED\nEVERYBODY THAT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TRUMP YOU'RE GOING TO GET.\nBUT TRUMP IS COUNTING ON ONE THING, THAT HIS ARDENT\nSUPPORTERS DON'T CARE. AND YOU CAN TELL BY THE AUDIENCE\nWHEN THEY'RE CLAPPING, THEY CLAP TO EVERYTHING HE SAYS.\nIF YOU ADMIT TO CARING, YOU ADMIT THAT YOU WERE WRONG.\nAND NO ONE LIKES TO ADMIT THEY'RE WRONG.\nSO THEY SAY HE EVOLVED, MAYBE I'LL EVOLVE TOO, BECAUSE I LIKE\nTHE MAN. I THINK THAT'S WHY THIS DOESN'T\nMATTER AS MUCH, EVEN THOUGH IT MATTERS TO THE PEOPLE THAT HE'S\nHURT AND DEMEANED FOR HOLDING THOSE SAME POSITIONS.\n>> I AGREE. BRIAN, PRESIDENT BUSH 43 WON 40%\nOF THE HISPANIC VOTE IN 2000, 44% IN 2004.\nIN 2008, McCAIN, THEY ESTIMATED HE NEEDED TO HIT 35%, HE ONLY\nGOT 30%. ROMNEY THEY SAID YOU'RE GOING TO\nHAVE TO HIT AT LEAST 35%. HE GOT 27%.\nEVEN IF TRUMP IS POLLING AS THE FOX NEWS LATINO POLLS SHOW 22%,\nBOTH TWO CANDIDATES LOST. SO IS A SOFTENING ON IMMIGRATION\nA POTENTIAL WAY TO TURN THINGS AROUND?\n>> THE BIGGEST SURPRISE FOR ME IS IT DIDN'T HAPPEN IN JULY.\nTHAT'S THE BIGGEST SURPRISE TO ME.\nTHIS IS 75 DAYS OUT. THE WAY HE DELIVERED IT, I GET\nTHE IMMIGRATION SPEECH IS GOING TO BE PUSHED OFF ANOTHER WEEK.\nHE'S STARTING TO SEE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS.\nANN COULTER CAME OUT AND SAID IF HE DOES THIS, IT WILL BE THE\nSHORTEST BOOK TOUR EVER, BECAUSE I CAN'T SUPPORT HIM.\nJEB BUSH CAME OUT TODAY AND SAID I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS GUY.\nBASICALLY THIS IS ALL A GAME FOR HIM.\nSO HE'S AGAINST IT. BUT MARCO RUBIO OR GOVERNOR\nKASICH, YOU WONDER IF THEY CAN NOW SUPPORT HIM.\nAND OTHER REPUBLICANS THINK NOW I CAN SUPPORT HIM.\nYOU RUN AGAINST OBAMACARE AND YOU GET TO THE GENERAL AND YOU\nGO MAN, IF I RUN AGAINST OBAMACARE, I WILL LOSE THAT\nINDEPENDENT, THEN I'M GOING TO KEEP THAT TO MYSELF.\n>> I'M ONLY SMILING, BECAUSE THAT WAS AMAZING SPIN.\nIT WAS AMAZING. I HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF IT THAT\nWAY. DO YOU THINK THAT JOHN KASICH\nAND RUBIO ARE THINKING NOW I CAN GET BEHIND DONALD TRUMP AFTER HE\nEVISCERATED ME AND CALLED ME THOSE NAMES?\n>> KASICH SAYS IT'S NOT PERSONAL.\nHE SAYS IT'S BECAUSE HE TALKED ABOUT THE DEPORTATION AND I\nCAN'T DO THAT. SO IF YOU TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES\nAND YOU ARE REPUBLICAN -- >> KELLY ANN CONWAY MAY HAVE HIS\nEAR. IN SIX OF THESE STATES, YOU HAVE\nTO DO BETTER THAN OBAMA, OR AT LEAST AS GOOD AS OBAMA, WITH\nHISPANICS. >> YEAH, HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO\nBUILD A WALL. AND A POLE VAULT OVER THE TOP.\nLOOK, NOBODY SAID IT'S GOING TO BE EASY, RIGHT?\nBUT YOU'VE GOT TO TRY. I THINK THE IMPACT OF KELLY ANN\nCONWAY HAS BEEN GOOD. I SAW HER DO ANOTHER INTERVIEW\nWITH RACHEL MADDOW. SHE'S DOING OUTREACH, COUPLING\nTHAT WITH THE FOCUS GROUPS. PERHAPS IT'S HAVING AN IMPACT.\nAS TO WHAT GREG SAID, I THINK YOU HIT IT ON THE HEAD.\nI THINK THAT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE WITH TRUMP ARE ALL IN ON HIM,\nVEGAS, THEY PUSHED ALL THE CHIPS IN AND THEY'RE GOING ALL THE\nWAY. >> THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO\nANYTHING TO HELP HILLARY. >> NO, THEY'RE NOT.\nIF HE TWEAKS THIS OR THAT AND SAYS EVERYBODY CAN STAY, THEY'RE\nGOING TO BE LIKE, THAT'S THEIR GUY.\n>> WHAT DO YOU THINK, JUAN? >> MY HAIR'S ON FIRE TODAY.\n>> ME, TOO. >> WAIT A SECOND, ISN'T THIS THE\nGUY THAT SAID, YOU KNOW, RAPISTS AND THIEVES BEING SENT HERE,\nMEXICANS, RIGHT? THIS IS THE GUY WHO SAYS\nOUTRAGEOUS THINGS ABOUT PEOPLE AND OH, HE'S CHANGING -- HE'S\nNOT CHANGING HIS IMMIGRATION POLICY.\nHE IS PANDERING AND HE'S TRYING TO GET DANA PERINO'S VOTE.\nHE'S NOT ANTI-IMMIGRANT. OVERWHELMINGLY THE AMERICAN\nPEOPLE THINK THAT PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE DEPORTED.\n>> WAIT A SECOND, WHO IS FOR THE TPP AND WHO'S AGAINST IT?\nWHAT DAY IS IT WITH HILLARY CLINTON?\n40 TIMES SHE IS FOR THE GOLD STANDARD AND NOW SHE CAN'T STAND\nIT. >> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE\nIMMIGRATION ISSUE. IT'S NOT THAT HE'S DOING A\nFLIP-FLOP, HE'S DOING CARTWHEELS.\nWHEN YOU H THIS IS NOT A CHANGE OF\nPOSITION, THIS IS NOT EVOLUTION. LISTEN TO WHAT CHARLES IS SAYING\nIN TERMS OH OF THE HONESTY OF THE ANALYSIS.\nHE IS PLAYING HIS SUPPORTERS FOR RUBES.\n>> THAT'S THE POINT HERE. IF YOU UNDERSTAND DONALD\nTRUMP -- THIS IS IMPORTANT. IF YOU UNDERSTAND DONALD TRUMP,\nYOU UNDERSTAND THAT EVERY POSITION IS NEGOTIABLE.\nIT'S THE SUPPORTERS WHO CALLED YOU A RINO FOR BELIEVING IN\nTHESE THING WHO ARE NOW OKAY WITH IT.\n>> IT WILL BE INTERESTING WITH THOSE IN THE MEDIA THAT\nSUPPORTED HIM ON THE DEPORTATION ISSUE CHANGE THEIR OPINION AND\nMAYBE BACK OFF AND LET THE CONGRESS SOLVE THIS ISSUE.\nMAYBE THAT WILL HAPPEN.",

THIS MORNING, CLINTON KEPT UP\nTHE ATTACKS ON TRUMP IN THE \"MORNING JOE\" EXCLUSIVE\nINTERVIEW. >> FROM THE START, HE HAS BUILT\nHIS CAMPAIGN ON PREJUDICE AND  PARANOIA, AND IT'S DEEPLY\nDISTURBING THAT HE IS TAKING HATE GROUPS THAT LIVED IN THE\nDARK REGIONS OF THE INTERNET, MAKING THEM MAINSTREAM AND\nREACHING OUT AND ASKING FAIR-MINDED AMERICANS TO\nREPUDIATE THIS KIND OF DIVISIVE DEMAGOGUERY.\n>> JOINING ME NOW IS NBC'S KATY TUR OUTSIDE TRUMP'S TOUR AND\nKASIE HUNT HERE WITH ME. THANK YOU SO MUCH KATY, LET'S\nTALK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP GOING BACK AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON\nTODAY. SHOWING THAT IN 2008, CERTAINLY\nTHE CLINTONS WERE CRITICIZED BY AFRICAN AMERICANS AND JIM\nCLYBURN WHERE THEY FELT BEING RACIAL OR USING RACIAL LANGUAGE\nOR RACIAL SUGGESTIONS AGAINST BARACK OBAMA, IT WAS NOTHING\nLIKE WHAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING NOW.\nHE'S PUT THEM ALTOGETHER INTO ONE BIG PACKAGE, HIS PEOPLE IN\nSOCIAL MEDIA. >> Reporter: YEAH, HE'S DOING\nTHAT, HE ALSO -- >> AND THE KINDS OF KIDS THAT\nARE CALLED SUPER PREDATORS, NO  TALK ABOUT WHY THEY ENDED UP\nTHAT WAY. FIRST WE HAVE TO BRING THEM TO\nHEEL. >> YOU CALLED OUT HILLARY\nCLINTON FOR SUPER PREDATOR BACK IN THE '90s WHEN SHE SUPPORTED\nTHE BILL, WHY DID YOU CALL THEM OUT?\n>> IT WAS A RACIST TERM AND EVERYBODY KNEW IT.\n>> NO CONSCIENCE. >> IT'S A WELL-THOUGHT OUT CRIME\nBILL THAT IS BOTH SMART AND TOUGH.\n>> NO EMPATHY. >> BLACK YOUTH SUPER PREDATORS.\nPLEASE EXPLAIN -- >> LET HER SPEAK.\n>> IT WAS A RACIST TERM AND EVERYBODY KNEW IT WAS A RACIST\nTERM. >> SO KATY, THIS IS SORT OF A\nRETREAD OF THE '90s AND ALSO OF '08, BUT DOES THAT EVEN COME\nCLOSE TO WHAT THE CLINTON TEAM IS AND SHE PERSONALLY, IS\nACCUSING DONALD TRUMP OF? >> Reporter: THE DIFFERENCE\nBEING DONALD TRUMP'S MESSAGE THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS USING\nAGAINST HIM IS LINKS TO WHITE SUPREMACIST, HIS DISAVOWAL OF\nDAVID DUKE, AB MAN IN A KKK COSTUME SAYING HE SUPPORTED\nDONALD TRUMP AND WHY HE BELIEVES DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTS HIM.\nTHAT'S ALL VERY RECENT, THAT'S IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS.\nIT'S NOT SOMETHING FROM 2008, IT'S NOT SOMETHING FROM THE\n'90s, SO IT ISN'T QUITE AS STRONG AS WHAT THE TRUMP TEAM IS\nTRYING TO DO. WHAT THE TRUMP TEAM DOES HAVE IN\nTHEIR FAVOR AND WHAT THEY BELIEVE WILL WORK FOR THEM, THE\nGENERAL DISLIKE THERE IS FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHE UNFAVORABILITY SHE HAS. THE UNTRUST WORTHINESS ISSUE\nTHAT SHE IS WITH HER AND THE FOUNDATION AND HER CAMPAIGN.\nSO THEY'RE TRYING TO UNDERCUT IN ANY WAY THAT POSSIBLY CAN, BUT I\nCAN TELL YOU THAT THIS CAMPAIGN CAME OUT VERY QUICKLY AND CAME\nOUT VERY FORCEFULLY AGAINST THIS HILLARY CLINTON AD WHERE SHE\nLINKED DONALD TRUMP TO WHITE SUPREMACIST, IT WAS THE QUICKEST\nRESPONSE WE'VE GOTTEN FROM THIS CAMPAIGN.\nIN DEFENSE OF HIM. BUT I WILL NOTE ONE OTHER THING,\nWHEN HILLARY CLINTON GAVE HER SPEECH YESTERDAY, WHAT WE HAVE\nNOT HEARD SINCE THEN IS REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP COMING OUT\nAND DEFENDING DONALD TRUMP. DEFENDING THEIR NOMINEE.\nSPOKESMAN FROM MITCH McCONNELL, SPOKESMAN FOR PAUL RYAN BOTH\nSAYING THAT THEIR CONGRESSMAN DID NOT WATCH THE SPEECH, WHICH\nIS VERY TELLING, YOU'RE HAVING THE RELATIONSHIP LEADERSHIP\nREFUSING TO DEFEND THEIR NOMINEE WHEN SOMEBODY IS BASICALLY\nTRYING TO -- EITHER LINK HIM TOP RACIST OR CALL HIM A RACIST.\n>> AT THE SAME TIME AS KATY IS POINTING OUT, THERE WAS A\nDIFFERENCE OF DEGREE HERE, KASIE, YOU WERE AT THE SPEECH IN\nNEVADA YESTERDAY, SHE USED DONALD TRUMP'S LANGUAGE IN THIS\nCAMPAIGN AGAINST HIM. IT WAS A BILL IN PARTICULAR AS\nMIKE WAS SAYING ON \"MORNING JOE,\" IT SOUNDED LIKE AN\nINDICTMENT, A POLITICAL INDICTMENT, IF YOU WILL, NOT A\nLEGAL INDICTMENT. >> RIGHT, BUT AS THOUGH THEY\nWERE READING OFF OF A DOCUMENT THAT JUST HAD POINT A, POINT B,\nPOINT C. SORT OF THIS CALM TONE\nTHROUGHOUT, VERY DIRECT, AND YOU KNOW, I THINK SHE CLEARLY IS\nVERY COMFORTABLE ON THIS TERRITORY.\nSHE CLEARLY BELIEVES WHAT SHE'S LAYING OUT AND THERE DOESN'T\nSEEM TO BE ANY NEED TO ESCALATE IT IN ANY WAY AND TONE OR IN ANY\nOTHER WAY THAT JUST USED THOSE WORDS ON THE PAPER.\nAND I THINK BEING IN THE ROOM AS SHE READ THROUGH THOSE BREITBART\nHEADLINES, YOU COULD HEAR PEOPLE KIND OF GASP.\nAND I DO THINK ONE, ONE THING THAT'S BEEN A LITTLE\nUNDERESTIMATED IS SIMPLY THE EFFECT OF PULLING THIS INTO THE\nPUBLIC EYE. I THINK, YOU KNOW, TWO DAYS AGO,\nTHEY PREVIEWED THAT SHE WAS -- TWO DAYS BEFORE THE SPEECH, THEY\nSAID, WE'RE GOING TO COME OUT AND TALK ABOUT THE ALTERNATIVE\nRIGHT. THEY GAVE EVERYONE TWO DAYS TO\nFIGURE OUT WHAT THAT IS, AND TO DIVE INTO WHAT TURNS OUT TO BE A\nPRETTY DARK WORLD, AND YOU KNOW, THAT ULTIMATELY ENDED UP\nOVERTAKING THIS ABOUT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION AND\nINTRODUCING AMERICANS TO SOMETHING PEOPLE WERE UNFAMILIAR",

ADS THAT USE TRUMP TO DESCRIBE\nTRUMP I THINK WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN HER COMING ON AND\nSAYING HE IS A RACIST. >> BILL PREST?\n>> FIRST OF ALL, I SAY SCORE, HILLARY, WE ARE NOT TODAY\nTALKING ABOUT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, BROOKE, WHICH WE\nTALKED ABOUT TWO DAYS AGO. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE\nCLINTON E-MAILS. I THINK SHE LAID A TRAP FOR\nDONALD TRUMP AND HE WALKED RIGHT INTO IT.\nSHE SAID SHE WAS GOING TO GIVE A SPEECH TALKING ABOUT HIS DOG\nWHISTLE CAMPAIGN. HE WENT OUT FIRST, ATTACKED HER\nAS A BIGOT AND THAT'S ALL WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT EVER SINCE.\nSO I THINK THE IDEA THAT DONALD TRUMP COULD STAY ON MESSAGE,\nHE'S FAILED YET AGAIN.

WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHY THEY ENDED\nUP THAT WAY BUT FIRST WE NEED TO BRING THEM TO HEAL.\n>> YOU CALLED OUT SECRETARY CLINTON FOR THE TERM \"SUPER\nPREDATOR\" BACK IN THE '90s. WHY?\n>> BECAUSE IT WAS A RACIST TERM AND EVERYBODY KNEW IT WAS A\nRACIST TERM. >> SO AGAIN, IT IS IMPORTANT\nCONTEXT. SHE MADE THE SUPER PREDATOR\nCOMMENT IN '96 WHEN SHE WAS STUMPING FOR HER -- DURING THE\nELECTION STUMPING FOR HER HUSBAND'S CRIMINAL JUSTICE\nREFORMS. YOU SAW IN THE DEBATES THIS PAST\nCYCLE WHEN BERNIE SANDERS CALLED IT RACIST.\nSO, DANA, BACK AND FORTH, THIS \"YOU'RE A RACIST,\" \"YOU'RE A\nBIGOT.\" >> AGAIN, WHAT ANDERSON WAS\nASKING FOR THAT PROOF, HE WAS TALKING -- DONALD TRUMP WAS\nANSWERING JUST BROADLY ABOUT HOW --\n>> HE WANTED TO PIN HIM DOWN ON WHAT GROUP.\n>> EXACTLY. THIS KIND OF SPECIFICITY DONALD\nTRUMP DIDN'T HAVE AT HIS FINGERTIPS.\nHE TALKED BROADLY ABOUT HIS NEW KIND OF LINE OF ATTACK THAT\nHILLARY CLINTON, LIKE ALL DEMOCRATS, HAVE NOT HELPED THE\nINNER CITIES, THEY TEND TO RUN THE INNER CITIES ACROSS THE\nCOUNTRY AND THEY'RE IN BAD SHAPE.\nBUT ON THE PERSONAL ATTACK THAT HE MADE AGAINST HER CALLING HER\nA BIGOT, HE DIDN'T HAVE THAT AT HIS FINGERTIPS.\nHIS CAMPAIGN CLEARLY DID AND THEY WANTED TO BOLSTER WHAT HE\nWAS SAYING, THAT'S WHY HE PUT THAT OUT THERE.\nHILLARY CLINTON AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS CAMPAIGN VERY EXPLICITLY\nSAID -- >> MATT SCHLAPP, HE SKIPPED OVER\nTHE BIGOT LINE DURING HIS SPEECH YESTERDAY.\nHE USED IT AGAIN WHETHER HE WAS TALKING TO DANA.\nYOU HAVE THIS INSTAGRAM VIDEO. >> RIGHT.\nI THINK -- LIKE I SAID, I WATCHED THIS INTERVIEW WITH\nANDERSON. WHAT TRUMPL SAID AT ONE POINT IS\nHER POLICIES ARE BIGOTED. WHAT ENDED UP HAPPENING, THIS IS\nA BIG CONSERVATIVE VERSUS LIBERAL ARGUMENT, IS SINCE\nLYNDON BAINES JOHNSON WE'VE HAD THESE GREAT SOCIETY PROGRAMS\nWHICH AGAIN BANKRUPTED THE COUNTRY AND LOOK AT THE\nVULNERABLE COMMUNITIES, LOOK AT DIVERSE COMMUNITIES.\nARE THEY BETTER OFF OR WORSE OFF?\nTHEY ARE MUCH BETTER OFF BECAUSE WE PASSED CIVIL RIGHTS\nLEGISLATION AND THEY WERE EMPOWERED WITH THEIR\nCONSTITUTIONAL CIVIL RIGHTS WHICH IS A GOOD THING THAT\nAMERICA DID. BUT THE POLICIES THESE SELVES,\nTHESE BIG SPENDING POLICIES HAVE LEFT THE FAMILIES FEELING MORE\nVULNERABLE. TRUMP HAS SO SAY HOW HILLARY\nCLINTON HAS DONE NOTHING TO REFORM OR CHANGE.\nAGAIN I WISH WE WOULD FOCUS ON THESE POLICIES AND LESS ON THESE\nWORDS. >> BROOKE, I WANT TO INVITE\nMYSELF TO MATT'S NEXT CONFERENCE.\n>> YOU CAN COME. >> I'LL BE GLAD TO DEBATE HIM ON\nTHE DIFFERENCES FOR THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY\nBETWEEN THE POLICIES FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND REPUBLICAN\nPARTY. BUT THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE HERE.\nTHE ISSUE HERE -- IF I MAY -- IS DONALD TRUMP CALLED HILLARY\nCLINTON A BIGOT, AS DANA POINTED OUT, WITHOUT ANY SPECIFICS WHEN\nPRESSED BY ANDERSON COOPER. NO SPECIFICS WHATSOEVER.\nHILLARY CLINTON IT NOT CALL DONALD TRUMP A BIGOT BUT SHE\nSAID HE'S DONE SOME RACIST THINGS.\nSHE CAME DOWN WITH A TREASURE CHEST OF THINGS STARTING WITH\nCALLING ALL MEXICANS RAPISTS, SAYING A MEXICAN JUDGE COULDN'T\nCOME UP WITH A FAIR VERDICT. HE'S BEEN SUED BY THE DEPARTMENT\nOF JUSTICE FOR NOT RENTING TO MINORITIES, ON AND ON AND ON,\nCALLING FOR A BAN ON ALL MUSLIMS, DEPORTING 11 MILLION\nPEOPLE. WHERE DO YOU START?\nWHERE DO YOU END? I THINK THAT'S A VERY TELLING\nINDICTMENT OF THE KIND OF CAMPAIGN THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS\nRUNNING ENDING WITH THE HIRING OF STEVE BANNON AT HIS CEO WHO\nCALLS HIS WEBSITE A PLATFORM FOR THE ALT-RIGHT, LIKE SAYING ALL\nTHE ALT-RIGHT ARE WELCOME IN MY CAMPAIGN.\nTHAT HURTS, MATT. >> I DONE THINK YOU CAN HAVE IT\nBOTH WAYS. HSH WENT TO THE CONVENTION IN\nPHILADELPHIA AND SAID WE SHOULDN'T BE USING THIS HARSH\nRHETORIC AND CROSSING THESE LINES.\nHER WHOLE CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT USING VERY HARSH RHETORIC FOR\nMAKING ALL OF US FEEL LIKE A RACIST.\n>> DENY -- DEINNY THAT DONALD TRUMP DID ALL THE THINGS OR SAID\nTHE THINGS THAT HILLARY CLINTON SAID.\nHE SAID THEM ALL. >> ON THE NEXT SEGMENT.\n>> LET'S GO. >> QUICK BUTTON ON THE POSITIVE\nSIT-DOWN MEETING WITH TRUMP AND SENIOR STAFF YESTERDAY.\n30 SECONDS. >> BILL WAS TALKING ABOUT STEVE\nBANNON BEING NOW AT THE HEAD OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.\nHE IS SOMEBODY WHO HAS SPENT A LOT OF TIME, REALLY HIS WHOLE\nPOLITICAL CAREER, NOT ONLY RUNNING AGAINST DEMOCRATS BUT\nTHE ESTABLISHMENT INSIDE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY SO THE OPEN\nQUESTION WHEN HE TOOK OVER WAS WOULD THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN STILL\nBE WORKING HAND IN GLOVE WITH THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL\nCOMMITTEE WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN. THE ANSWER APPEARS TO BE YES\nBECAUSE I'M TOLD THAT TOP STAFFERS FROM THE RNC CAME TO\nNEW YORK YESTERDAY, SAT DOWN WITH TRUMP OFFICIALS AND I'M\nTOLD BY MULTIPLE SOURCES THAT IT WAS A VERY POSITIVE,\nCONSTRUCTIVE MEETING TALKING ABOUT LOU TO GO FORWARD TOGETHER\nTO WIN BATTLEGROUND STATES. >> DANA, TIM, MATT AND BILL,\nTHANK YOU ALL SO MUCH.",

I THINK THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN AND\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAVE TO CAMPAIGN AS THOUGH THIS RACE IS\nA 50/50 RACE. IT IS GOING TO BE CLOSE UP TO\nTHE LAST MINUTE. I HAVE SAID SO CONSISTENTLY ALL\nYEAR. >> I WANT TO GET TO THIS.\nTHERE IS SOMETHING INTERESTING IN THIS QUINNIPIAC POLL, THAT'S\nWHEN WE LOOK AT THE NEGATIVES. SO 64% OF LIKELY TRUMP VOTERS\nSAY THEIR ARE BACKING DONALD TRUMP MAYBELY BECAUSE THEY'RE\nANTI-CLINTON. ONLY 25% SAY THEY'RE VOTING FOR\nHIM BECAUSE THEY LIKE TRUMP. THE NEWS IS NOT MUCH BETTER FOR\nHILLARY CLINTON. WHEN WE PUT UP THOSE NUMBERS,\nONLY 32%, NOT EVEN A THIRD, SAY THEY'RE VOTING FOR HER BECAUSE\nTHEY ARE PRO-HILLARY CLINTON.

AND THAT NUMBER IS PROBABLY EVEN\nSMALLER NOW WITH THE LATEST NEWS THAT SHE USED THE STATE\nDEPARTMENT AS A CASH MACHINE TO ENRICH THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nTHAT REPORT FROM THE ASSOCIATED PRESS.\nHARDLY A BIASED ORGANIZATION. >> THEY BOTH HAVE VERY HIGH\nUNFAVORABLES SO WHAT I'D REALLY LIKE TO KNOW FROM BOTH OF YOU,\nBETSY, YOU CAN FINISH THIS AND THEN HILARY CAN WRAP IT UP.\nONLY A QUARTER OF PEOPLE IN YOUR CASE SAY THEY'RE VOTING FOR\nTRUMP ARE DOING IT BECAUSE OF TRUMP THE CANDIDATE AS OPPOSED\nTO HILLARY CLINTON. >> I'M SURE HE'LL TAKE THEIR\nVOTE FOR WHATEVER REASON. A VOTE IS A VOTE.\nTHE FACT IS AMERICANS ARE GOING TO REALIZE THEY WOULD MUCH\nPREFER 4% ECONOMIC GROWTH TO THE CURRENT 1.2% ECONOMIC GROWTH.\nTHEY WANT MORE TAKE HOME PAY. >> HILARY, A QUICK LAST WORD.\n>> I THINK THIS HAS BEEN A UGLY POLITICAL SEASON.\nI THINK BERNIE SANDERS AND HILLARY CLINTON HAD A PRIMARY\nBASED ON THE ISSUES.

YOU HAVE NO JOBS.\n>> LOOK AT MY AFRICAN-AMERICAN OVER HERE.\n>> TRUMP MANAGEMENT WAS CHARGED WITH DISCRIMINATING AGAINST\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS AND BREAKING FEDERAL LAW.\n>> I HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BLACKS.\nI'VE ALWAYS HAD A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BLACKS.\n>> WHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE?\n>> I'M HILLARY CLINTON AND I APPROVE THIS MESSAGE.\n>> BACK WITH ME NOW, LARRY SABATO AND RYAN LIZZA.\nWE SEE THAT AD. THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH TALK ON\nBOTH SIDES. AND FRANKLY EVEN JUST IN THE\nLAST 24 HOURS. REALLY FEELS IN MANY WAYS TO BE\nAN UNPRECEDENTED MUDSLINGING CAMPAIGN BETWEEN TWO CANDIDATES.\nAT THE END OF THE DAY, IT'S ABOUT HOW VOTERS RESPOND TO\nTHIS. IT FEELS LIKE UNCHARTED\nTERRITORY, LARRY. COULD IT BACKFIRE?\n>> WELL, I THINK IT IS BACKFIRING IF THE GOAL BY DONALD\nTRUMP IS TO GET A LARGER MINORITY VOTE.\nLOOK, FOUR YEARS AGO, MITT ROMNEY GOT LESS THAN 20% OF ALL\nMINORITY GROUPS PUT TOGETHER. THAT IS PRESIDENT OBAMA GOT MORE\nTHAN 80%. THE SHOCKING THING IS THAT THIS\nYEAR HILLARY CLINTON IS GOING TO DO BETTER, IN MY VIEW, THAN\nPRESIDENT OBAMA DID. SHE'S GOING TO GET WELL ABOVE\n80% OF ALL MINORITIES. THAT MEANS THE ONLY WAY, THE\nONLY WAY DONALD TRUMP CAN WIN IS WITH A LARGE MAJORITY OF WHITES\nAND A LARGE TURNOUT AMONG WHITES AND IT PROBABLY IS IMPOSSIBLE.\nTHERE ARE LOADS OF WHITES, WHITE WOMEN, COLLEGE-EDUCATED WHITES,\nYOUNGER WHITES, WHO ARE SIMPLY NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR DONALD\nTRUMP. SO GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.\nRYAN MENTIONED EARLIER, AND I THINK CORRECTLY, THAT WHAT TRUMP\nIS REALLY TRYING TO DO WITH THIS NEW SUDDEN OUTREACH TO\nMINORITIES IS TO REASSURE SOME OF THE MORE MODERATE REPUBLICANS\nWHO ARE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE BEING ASSOCIATED WITH A CANDIDATE\nWHO'S DISLIKED SO INTENSELY BY MINORITY AMERICANS.\n>> AND IT'S INTERESTING YOU SAY THAT BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP IS\nREALLY STARTING TO HIT BACK ON SOME OF THE CRITICISM THAT HE'S\nFACED. WE EVEN HEARD HIM TALKING ABOUT\nWHEN HE WAS OF COURSE CALLING HILLARY CLINTON A BIGOT.\nHE'S SAYING, LOOK, STOP PAINTING MY SUPPORTERS WITH SUCH A BROAD\nBRUSH. HERE'S A LITTLE MORE OF THAT.\n>> IT'S A MOVEMENT, FOLKS, LIKE THEY'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.\nAND GOING TO ACCUSE DECENT AMERICANS WHOSE SUPPORT THIS\nCAMPAIGN, YOUR CAMPAIGN, OF BEING RACISTS, WHICH WE'RE NOT.\nIT'S THE OLDEST PLAY IN THE DEMOCRATIC PLAYBOOK.\n>> SO DONALD TRUMP COMING OUT AND SAYING THIS IS A DEMOCRATIC\nPLAY AND THIS IS ON THE HEELSP OF COURSE A SEPARATE AD FROM\nHILLARY CLINTON WHERE SHE'S GOT KLAN MEMBERS EXPRESSING SUPPORT\nFOR DONALD TRUMP. RYAN, WILL EITHER ONE HAVE AN\nIMPACT? >> I THINK HIS RESPONSE TO THAT\nIS SHREWD, RIGHT. THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO\nSUPPORT DONALD TRUMP OBVIOUSLY WHO ARE NOT RACIST.\nAND BY HIS COMEBACK HERE WITH CLINTON IS OH, SHE IS JUST\nPAINTING ALL OF YOU, THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO LIKE HIM\nFOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER, AS RACIST.\nI THINK THAT IS A WAY TO KEEP THOSE FOLKS IN THE FOLD AND NOT,\nYOU KNOW, AND NOT RESPONSE TO CLINTON'S AD.\nBUT, LOOK, AS LARRY POINTED OUT, THE KEY TO VICTORY FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON NO MATTER WHO SHE HAD FACED, WHETHER IT WAS DONALD\nTRUMP OR A MORE TRADITIONAL REPUBLICAN, WAS GOING TO BE TO\nREASSEMBLE WHAT SOMETIMES IS CALLED THE OBAMA COALITION.\nTHAT MEANS RACKING UP VERY, VERY LARGE MARGINS AMONG NONWHITE\nVOTERS. THAT WAS THE CLINTON PLAYBOOK\nFROM BEFORE SHE STARTED RUNNING FOR OFFICE.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS MADE THAT PLAN A WHOLE LOT EASIER.\nBECAUSE HE'S ALIENATED SOME OF THE SAME GROUPS THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON NEEDS TO DO VERY WELL WITH.\nSO IF YOU JUST LOOK AT WHAT HER STRATEGY WAS IN THE BEGINNING\nAND HOW IT'S PLAYING OUT SO FAR, IT'S BASICALLY GOING ACCORDING\nTO PLAN AND HE'S PLAYING -- HE'S WAY BEHIND, YOU KNOW, STARTING\nIN AUGUST AND FOR THE FIRST TIME TRYING TO REACH OUT TO HISPANIC\nVOTERS AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS, THAT IS YB HE'S WAY\nBEHIND THE 8 BALL. ON THE OTHER HAND, AS HE SAID\nTHIS TO AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS, WHAT DOES HE HAVE TO LOSE.\nHE'S AT 1% WITH AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS IN SOME OF THESE POLLS.\nHE CAN'T GO MUCH LOWER. >> DOES HILLARY CLINTON HAVE\nANYTHING TO LOSE, LARRY, BY TURNING NEGATIVE, BY, YOU KNOW,\nRESPONDING TO DONALD TRUMP SO FORCEFULLY AND NOT TALKING AS\nMUCH ABOUT POLICIES OR PLANS OR CONCRETE IDEAS?\n>> WELL, IT'S DIFFICULT TO RUN A CAMPAIGN ON A HIGH PLAIN WHEN\nYOUR OPPONENT IS VERY MUCH ON THE LOW LOW.\nHAVING SAID THAT, SHE HAS SERIOUS PROBLEMS BEING PERCEIVED\nAS DISHONEST AND TRUSTWORTHY AND MORE LIKABLE.\nTHE MORE NEGATIVE YOU ARE IN THE CAMPAIGN, THE LESS LIKABLE\nYOU'RE GOING TO APPEAR TO INDEPENDENTS AND TO SUPPORTERS\nOF YOUR OWN. YES, THERE IS A COST TO IT.\nON THE OTHER HAND, AN ATTACK UNANSWERED IS AN ATTACK AGREED\nTO. I DON'T SEE HOW SHE HAS ANY\nCHOICE BUT TO BE VERY TOUGH ON THE ATTACK.\n>> APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE,",

TAKE A LOOK.\nYOU'LL SEE WHAT I MEAN. >> BIRTH CONTROL MAKES WOMEN\nUNATTRACTIVE AND CRAZY. >> LISTEN TO THIS.\n>> HOIST IT HIGH AND PROUD. THE CONFEDERATE FLAG PRO --\nPROCLAIMS A GLORIOUS HERITAGE.\n>> THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS THE LEADING PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE\nSAYING THIS. SHE WAS READING HEADLINES FROM\nBREITBART.COM. STEVE COMES FROM BREITBART AND\nIT IS SUPPOSED TO BE A FLAVOR OF HIS WORK.\nTHE RADICAL TRIPPING IS TAKING OVER THE GOP UNDER TRUMP.\nFOR HIS PART IN THE GOP NOMINEE HE TRIED TO PREEMPT\nTHE ATTACK WITH HIS OWN SPEECH IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.\n>> WHEN DEMOCRATIC POLICIES FAIL, THEY ARE LEFT WITH ONLY\nTHIS ONE TIRED ARGUMENT. YOU'RE RACIST, YOU'RE RACIST,\nYOU'RE RACIST. IT IS THE LAST REFUGE OF THE\nDISCREDITED DEMOCRAT POLITICIAN.\n>> CAMILLE, HERE IS THE THING, TRUMP'S NOT WRONG WHEN HE SAYS\nTHAT, BUT THE THING ABOUT HILLARY'S SPEECH IS SHE AIN'T\nWRONG EITHER. >> SHE AIN'T WRONG ABOUT\nWHAT? >> EVERYTHING SHE SAID.\n>> THE BREITBART? THOSE WERE REAL HEADLINES.\nLOOK, I THINK THERE ARE PLENTY OF THINGS TO DISLIKE ABOUT\nBREITBART ABOUT A PUBLICATION.\nWHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE RACIST, I DON'T KNOW.\nIT IS SO EASY TO THROW THAT AROUND.\nIT IS THE MOST POI SAW NUSS CONDEMNATION IN OUR SOCIETY.\nIT IS IMPORTANT TO ENGAGE ON THE ISSUES AND THE IDEAS.\nTHERE IS NOTHING RACIST ABOUT STATING AN ABSOLUTE FACT.\nFOR EXAMPLE, THAT THEY HAVE GOT IN TROUBLE RECENTLY THAT\nBLACK PEOPLE ACCOUNT FOR A DISPROPORTIONAT AMOUNT OF\nVIOLENT CRIME IN THE COUNTRY. WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO WHEN YOU\nHEAR THAT STAT IS YOU ENGAGE IT.\n>> A RACIST COULD USE THAT TO BOLSTER THEIR AWFUL, IDIOTIC\nARGUMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE HEREDITARY DEFICIENCY OF\nSOMEONE WHO HAPPENS TO BE BLACK.\nBUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THOSE FACTS ARE INHERENTLY BAD AND\nAWFUL TO TALK ABOUT IN ANY CONTEXT.\n>> BUT THE -- >> BREITBART GOES BEYOND THE\nPALE, BUT LET'S BE HONEST. WHEN HILLARY CLINTON SAID\nEVERYONE SUPPORTING DONALD TRUMP IS FROM THE ALT RIGHT, I\nDON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE. >> THAT'S CRAZY.\n>> IT IS IMPORTANT TO BE HONEST AND CANDID ABOUT THAT.\nIT IS EASY TO CALL YOUR OPPONENT RACIST SO YOU DON'T\nHAVE TO ENGAGE IN THEIR IDEAS.\nTHAT'S OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS IN OUR POLITICS.\n>> MEGAN, AS THE ALT RIGHT TAKEN OVER THE GOP OR IS IT A\nBLIP? >> I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE\nTAKEN OVER THE ALT RIGHT. I CONSIDERED BREITBART TO BE\nTHE MOTHER SHIP OF THE ALT RIGHT SO IT DEFINITELY SENDS A\nMESSAGE. I DON'T LIKE THROWING AROUND\nTHE TERM \"RACISM.\" IT IS THE WORST THING YOU CAN\nSAY ABOUT AN INDIVIDUAL. DONALD TRUMP IS DOING POORLY\nIN THE POLLS WITH HISPANICS AND AFRICAN-AMERICANS.\nHE IS TRYING TO MAKE AN APPEAL TO THESE DEMOGRAPHICS OF\nVOTERS. IF IT WORKS, I DON'T KNOW.\nWE ARE 74 DAYS OUT AND IT MAY BE TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE.\n>> I SAW A TWEET THAT HILLARY'S SPEECH -- SHE TRIED\nTO USE GUILT BY ASSOCIATION TACTIC AGAINST TRUMP.\nARE YOU BUYING THAT? JAY HE IS GILL --\n>> HE IS GUILTY AS CHARGED. HE SEES ONE CHARACTER AFTER\nTHE NEXT. IT HAS BEEN PROBLEMATIC AND\nTHEY STEP DOWN ACCORDINGLY EVERY TIME.\nTHIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THAT.\nTHIS IS NOT THE BEST GUY TO BE ALIGNED WITH IF HE IS TRYING\nTO WIN OVER THE MINORITY VOTERS.\n>> TRUMP RESPONDED TO THE SPEECH TWEETING HILLARY\nCLINTON'S SHORT SPEECH IS PANDERING TO THE WORST\nINSTINCTS IN OUR SOCIETY AND SHE SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF\nHERSELF. DO YOU THINK SHE IS ASHAMED OF\nHERSELF? >> ABSOLUTELY NOT.\nALL SHE DID WAS REPEAT THE HEADLINES THAT WE ARE\nPANDERING TO THE WORST PART OF OUR SOCIETY.\nHER SPEECH WAS CLIPS OF THE HEADLINES THAT HIS GUY WROTE.\n>> DO YOU THINK TRUMP HAS -- I DON'T WANT TO CALL IT A RACE\nPROBLEM. >> THAT'S ALWAYS THE CASE FOR\nTHE REPUBLICANS. JAY THE REPUBLICANS NUMBERS\nHAVE GOTTEN WORSE PROGRESSIVELY AMONG BLACK\nVOTERS, FOR EXAMPLE. I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS IS AN\nINDICATION OF THE UNIQUE AWFULNESS.\n>> 94% OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS HAVE AN UNFAVORABLE VIEW OF\nDONALD TRUMP WITH A 5% MARGIN OF ERROR.\nMY FATHER RAN AGAINST THE FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT AND AT A\nHIGHER DEMOGRAPHIC. LISTEN, AS JOHN ADAMS SAYS,\nFACTS ARE STUBBORN THINGS. I AM NOT GOING TO LIVE IN AN\n-- >> HANG ON.\nHANG ON. >> I WILL NOT LIVE IN AN\nALTERNATE UNIVERSE WHERE FACTS DON'T MEAN A THING.\nI GAVE YOU THE STATISTICS. >> YOU GAVE ME THE POPULARITY\nNUMBERS AND I AM FINE WITH THAT.\nWHAT I AM SUGGESTING IS THIS. WHEN IT COMES TO THE\nPERSPECTIVE OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS ON THESE\nMATTERS, I DON'T KNOW THAT DONALD TRUMP IS SORT OF\nUNIQUELY CONTEMPTIBLE TO THEM.\nHE IS OUT THERE SAYING THINGS THAT MAKE IT CLEAR HE HATES\nBLACK FOLK. >> NOT CONDEMNING DAVID DUKE'S\nENDORSEMENT SENDS A DIRECT MESSAGE.\n>> USING TOLL PICKS AS A BIRTHER TOO.\n>> LISTEN, ENTERING -- >> I'M SORRY.\nI AM NOT GOING TO CONCEDE THAT MITT ROMNEY --\n>> THIS IS A GREAT SPEECH. >> CONTINUE BY ALL MEANS.\n>> HERE IS THE BOTTOM LINE. THERE ARE PLENTY OF THINGS\nDONALD TRUMP HAS DONE THAT ARE EP REPREHENSIBLE.\nIT IS A MISTAKE TO GO OVER THE LINE AND TALK ABOUT THE UNIQUE\nDANGER TO THE EXTENT WE JUSTIFY OR REDEEM OR ELIMINATE\nALL OF THE VARIOUS THINGS THAT ARE AWFUL ABOUT ANY NUMBER OF\nOTHER CANDIDATES. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS\nREPUBLICANS HAVE ALWAYS HAD A PROBLEM WITH GETTING BLACK\nFOLKS TO VOTE FOR THEM FOR A NUMBER OF COMPLICATED\nREASONS. THIS ELECTION IS NOT ANY\nDIFFERENT. >> STARTING WITH BARRY GOLD\nWATER. >> LET ME MOVE ON.\nBEFORE HE CALLED TRUMP A RACIST HE CALLED HER A\nBIGGOT. LET'S GO BACK IN OUR TIME\nMACHINE AND GO BACK TO WEDNESDAY.\n>> HILLARY CLINTON IS A BIGOT WHO SEES PEOPLE OF COLOR.\n>> KEEP AN EYE ON THE WOMAN ON THE LEFT.\n>> HILLARY CLINTON IS A BIGOT.\nWHO SEES PEOPLE OF ONLY AS VOTES AND NOT AS HUMAN\nBEINGS WORTHY OF A BETTER FUTURE.\nSHE IS GOING TO DO NOTHING FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS.\n>> MAY AGAIN, DOES TRUMP HAVE A POINT?\n>> THESE ARE HARSH TERMS TO BE LOWING AROUND.\nLISTEN, MY OPINION CLEARLY ON THIS, WE DIVERGE ON THE\nPERSPECTIVE OF THIS. HE IS TRYING TO REACH OUT TO\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS. HE SAID THIS WEEK WHAT DO YOU\nHAVE TO LOSE TO VOTE FOR ME? FOR ME IT IS TOO LITTLE, TOO\nLATE. >> THAT'S NOT THE STRONGEST\nMESSAGE, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE?\n>> NO. >> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF TRUMP.\n>> FOR THE LAST YEAR I HAVE BEEN WATCHING DONALD TRUMP BE\nTHE QUINTESSENTIAL EXAMPLE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL PROJECTION.\nANYTHING HE SAID ABOUT ANYBODY ELSE YOU CAN TURN IT ON A DIME\nAND IT WOULD BE DESCRIBING HIMSELF TO A T.\nTHE BIGGER COMMENT IS NOT AS BIG AND WE CAN GET BACK TO\nRACISM. HIS POINT IS THEY WERE IN\nCHARGE AND NONE OF THEIR POLICIES HAVE DONE ANYTHING\nFOR PEOPLE OF COLOR OR INNER CITY PEOPLE.\nI GUESS WHAT HE IS TRYING TO SAY IS HILLARY THOUGHT HE READ\nTHIS SOMEWHERE ON-LINE AND ALL OF THE VACCINES THAT THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION HAS PROVIDED FOR UNDER PRIVILEGED\nPEOPLE WERE FILLED WITH POTASSIUM CHLORIDE.\nSHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY CLUE. IT IS ABSURD.\nIT IS TRUMP AND I AM GETTING TIRED OF SAYING IT.\nMEANWHILE, HILLARY HAS NOT DENIED THIS.\n>> DO YOU KNOW HOW CRAZY OF A THING YOU HAVE TO SAY TO MAKE\nTHAT WOMAN EXPRESS EMOTION? SHE HAS NOT EXPRESSED EMOTION\nIN 35 YEARS. SHE IS A PLASTIC BARBIE DOLL.\n>> DO YOU KNOW HER? >> SHE IS MY MOM.\n>> MY PERSPECTIVE IS THE HYPERBOLE AND THE GUY IS SO\nSCARY THAT YOU SHOULD VOTE FOR ME, IT IS PAR FOR THE COURSE.\nIT IS NOT THAT WHAT HE SAYS IS NOT DEPLORABLE.\nBOTH PARTIES TRAFFIC IN UTTER NONSENSE.\nLIKE THAT GUY IF YOU VOTE FOR HIM HE IS GOING TO GET YOU\nKILLED. SOMETIMES POLITICS IS ABOUT\nWHAT CAN THIS CANDIDATE DO FOR ME?\nTHE OTHER GUY IS SO SCARY. YOU THINK I AM AWFUL AND IT IS\nTRUE. THEY THINK BOTH CANDIDATES ARE\nAWFUL. DON'T VOTE FOR HIM BECAUSE HE\nWILL GET YOU KILLED. >> I WANT TO MOVE ON TO A MORE\nSERIOUS DISCUSSION. HE IS NOW GOING AFTER HER\nCELEBRITY SUPPORTERS. >> THE ONLY THING ENTHUSIASTIC\nABOUT HER CAMPAIGN ARE HOLLYWOOD CELEBRITIES AND IN\nMANY CASES CELEBRITIES THAT ARE NOT VERY HOT ANYMORE.\n>> IT IS ONE THING TO GO AFTER HILLARY, BUT TO ATTACK\nCELEBRITIES, IT IS GOING TOO FAR .\n>> WE CAN'T ALL GET SCOTT BAY CROW.\n SCOTT BAIO. >> JESSICA BIEL.\n>> KIM KARDASHIAN. >> IT IS TOUGH.\nBUT TRUMP CELEBRITY SUPPORTERS ARE HOT.\nAND SO ON I GUESS. >> SHE IS HUGE.\n>> I HEARD MY OTHER BROTHER DARRELL IS A TRUMP SUPPORTER.\n>> WE HAD SOME MORE ABOUT THIS TODAY.\nWHAT DID HE SAY WHEN HE SAID NOT HOT.\n>> WAS IT TO THE WAY THEY LOOK?\n>> CHER CAME OUT AGAINST HIM IN A FUNDRAISER, I BELIEVE.\nAND I THINK HE IS COMING OUT ATTACKING HIM.\nMY TOP GIRL CRUSHES KATY PERRY AND THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN\nIN THE WORLD. IT IS THE DUMBEST ARGUMENT TO\nMAKE IN ANY CONTEXT. DEMOCRATS ALWAYS WIN WHEN IT\nCOMES TO CELEBRITIES. MY FATHER'S BIGGEST SAW WILL\nBE BRA TEE WAS THE GUY FROM THE DIABETES COMMERCIAL THAT\nWAS OUR BIG ONE. IT IS A VERY STRANGE\nARGUMENT. >> DO YOU THINK GOING AFTER\nCELEBRITIES, IS THIS THE THING THAT FINALLY BRINGS DOWN\nTRUMP? >> ABSOLUTELY.\nLOOK, BEYONCE IS ON HILLARY'S SIDE.\nIT DOES NOT SPEAK TO HER POLICY, BUT HE GETS FOUR PAW\nNOBODY CROWS. SHE CLEARLY WON THE DAY.\n>> SHE IS HOT CAREER WISE. >> IT IS ALL THE WAY AROUND.\n>> WITH EVERYTHING HE HAS GOT GOING ON HE THINKS HE NEEDS TO\nADDRESS -- I NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THE CHER ENDORSEMENT.\n>> IT IS IMPORTANT. >> I DON'T THINK THE MAN CARES\nENOUGH ABOUT THE OTHER HUMAN BEINGS.\nI THINK HE IS REPEATING THINGS HE PICKED UP ALONG THE WAY IN\nTHE LINE OF WORK HE IS IN. THAT'S MY OPINION.\n>> MIGHT BE TRUE. MOVING ON TRUMP SAID HE WOULD\nWORK WITH THE UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS AND CONSIDERING\nSOME STAY IN THE U.S. INSTEAD OF DEPORTING ALL 11 MILLION.\nIT SOUNDS LIKE A MAJOR POLICY CHANGE.\nBUT WAIT. IT'S NOT.\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN SPOKESPERSON EXPLAINS.\n>> HE HAS CHANGED THE WORD THAT HE IS SAYING.\n>> MEGAN, IS IT JUST ME, BUT THAT SOUNDED LIKE SPIN.\n>> I COMPARE THIS TO I HAVEN'T GAINED WEIGHT.\nIT IS THE NUMBERS ON THE SCALE.\nI HAVE TO TIP MY HAT TO KATRINA PEARSON.\nSHE CAN SPEND ANY AMOUNT OF GARBAGE IN ANYWAY AND ANY\nFORM. THAT'S A GIFT.\nI COULD NOT LIVE WITH MYSELF. THIS IMMIGRATION FLIP-FLOP IS\nTHE MOST FASCINATE WILLING CHANGE OF HIS ELECTION.\nI DIDN'T THINK THEY COULD GET A BUNCH OF HARD CORE\nCONSERVATIVES THAT -- CONGRATULATIONS.\n>> DO YOU THINK -- DO YOU THINK HIS SUPPORTERS WILL BE\nLIKE, OKAY, SO FOLLOW HIM? ARE THEY JUST SITTING THERE\nHEART BROKEN? >> SOME ARE PRETTY UPSET.\nI HEARD SOME SAYING ON THE RADIO THAT IF HE DOES PIVOT\nTHAT FAR THEY WILL TAKE THEIR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS AND\nATTACK TRUMP. IT IS SOMETHING ALONG THOSE\nLINES. YOU CAN LEAN WHAT YOU WANT.\nTHIS MIGHT NOT BE THE WISEST MOVE FOR HIM.\nI DON'T THINK HE IS CONCERNED ABOUT HIS BASE.\n>> NOT BEING CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR BASE AND WINNING OVER NEW\nVOTERS IS SOMETHING YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO DO.\n>> IT HAPPENS IN THE GENERAL. PEOPLE CHANGING THEIR\nPERSPECTIVES AND THEY GRADUALLY MOVE AFTER THE\nPRIMARIES AND YOUR PEOPLE COME OUT AND THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO\nSPIN. SHE IS NOT AT ALL DELICATE\nABOUT -- BUT NEITHER IS HE. I REMEMBER THE RHETORIC WHEN\nHE TALKED ABOUT HOW QUICKLY HE WOULD DEPORT EVERYONE.\nTHEY HAVE TO GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.\nSUDDENLY WE CAN WORK WITH THEM. >> HE DID SAY IF THEY WERE\nGOOD WE WOULD BRING THEM BACK.\n>> SHE IS RIGHT ABOUT ONE THING.\nHE HAS CHANGED HIS WORDS. THEY JUST HAPPEN TO BE\nSOMEBODY ELSE'S WORDS. >> AND WE KEEP SAYING IT IS\nIMPRESSIVE. THEY JUST SAID SOMETHING\nCOMPLETELY DIFFERENT. I AM JUST GOING TO TELL YOU\nSOMETHING ABOUT THE LOGIC. >> THAT'S WHAT TALKING TO\nTRUMP SURROGATES ARE LIKE. IT IS NOT EVEN WORTH IT.\nWORDS ARE COMING OUT OF HIS MOUTH.\nYOU ARE NO LONGER TALKING ABOUT DEPORTING THEM.\nYOU ARE TALKING ABOUT IMMIGRATION REFORM.\nCOMPASSIONATE CONSERVATIVES HAVE BEEN CRUCIFIED FOR THE\nLAST EIGHT YEARS AND NOW TRUMP SAYS IT AND WE ARE GOLDEN?\n>> YOU JUST SAID -- YOU SAID IT DEPENDS ON WHAT THE\nDEFINITION OF IS. ARE YOU SAYING THAT TRUMP IS\nQUINTONIAN? >> VERY MUCH SO, YES.\nI AM FLUSTERED BECAUSE I AM SO THRILLED TO BE ONSET WITH A\nGOOD REPUBLICAN. >> DEPENDING ON YOUR\nPERSPECTIVE. I AM NEVER TRUMP AND I AM\nNEVER HILLARY. I ALWAYS THOUGHT HE WAS A MAKE\nOIL SALESMAN. >> WHAT DO YOU DO THEN IF YOU\nARE NEVER TRUMP AND NEVER HILLARY?\n>> I WRITE IN LYNDSAY GRAHAM. >> COMING UP, WAS HOPE SOLO\nSUSPENDED FOR DEFENDING ANOTHER COUNTRY?\nTHIS WOULD NEVER HAPPEN UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP.",

A GIRL BEING PUSHED BY A WHITE\nMAN. THESE ARE THINGS THAT DON'T\nBOLSTER DONALD TRUMP'S IMAGE AS SOMEBODY WHO IS GOING TO BRING\nMORE PEOPLE INTO THE REPUBLICAN FOLD.\nTHEN THERE ARE FOLKS LIKE THE WHITE SU PREP CYSTS WHO BELIEVE\nDONALD TRUMP IS ADVOCATING THEIR MESSAGE.\nHE'S A FIGHTER FOR THE WHITE SUPREMACISTS OF THIS COUNTRY.\nTHAT IMAGE OF THE MAN IN A KKK COSTUME SAYING THAT HE BELIEVES\nIN DONALD TRUMP AND E HE BELIEVES DONALD TRUMP BELIEVES\nIN HIM. THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT DON'T\nHELP THE CAMPAIGN. BUT REGARDLESS THEY ARE MOVING\nFORWARD WITH THIS OUTREACH MESSAGE THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO\nPUT OUT THERE. THEY ARE TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO\nAPPEAL TO MINORITY VOTERS AND THEY ARE HOPING THAT DOWN THE\nLINE THROUGH THIS CAMPAIGN, IT'S GOING TO FIND ITS ROOTS.\n>> REAL FAST ON IMMIGRATION AND A TRUMP POLICY, SOME PEOPLE\nWOULD CHARACTERIZE IT AS TRUMP BEING A WEATHER VANE SAYING\nWHATEVER IS GOING TO GET HIM ELECTED.\nHAVE YOU HEARD A TIMETABLE WHEN HE'S GOING TO GIVE A POLICY\nSPEECH? >> THE POLICY OF HIS -- HIS\nIMMIGRATION POLICY IS UP IN THE AIR.\nI'M NOT SURE WHERE HE STANDS. SOME SORT OF PATH TO\nLEGALIZATION FOR THE UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS THAT ARE\nIN THIS COUNTRY AS LONG AS THEY PAY BACK TAXES.\nHE'S GONE BACK ON FORTH ON THIS ISSUE.\nTHE CAMPAIGN ALSO DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE A CLEAR ANSWER ON THIS.\nTHE ONLY INDICATION THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME CLARIFICATION\nGOING FORWARD IS DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF SAYING YESTERDAY THAT\nHE'S GOING TO HAVE AN IMMIGRATION POLICY SPEECH COMING\nUP IN THE NEXT WEEK OR SO. WE DON'T HAVE A HARD DATE.\nWE DON'T HAVE A HARD LOCATION ON THAT, BUT THERE SHOULD BE SOME\nSORT OF CLARIFICATION COMING SOON.\nEVEN WITH HIS TERROR CLARIFICATIONS OR MUSLIM BAN\nCLARIFICATIONS, IT'S TERRITORIES, THAT STILL REMAINS\nMUDDY AS WELL. E WE COULD SEE A CLARIFICATION\nTHAT ISN'T MUCH OF A CLARIFICATION AT ALL.\n>> KATY TUR, THANK YOU. I WANT TO GO TO ALEX, WHO IS\nFOLLOWING THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN. DOES THE ALT-RIGHT STRATEGY, THE\nSPEECH FROM HILLARY CLINTON, DOES THAT APPEAR TO BE WORKING\nKEEPING THE TRUMP FOLKS ON DEFENSE?\n>> THERE'S A LARGE PORTIONS OF AMERICANS DO BELIEVE THAT TRUMP\nSPEAKS TO BIGOTS. THERE'S A POLL SAYING YESTERDAY\nAND THAT'S WHAT CLINTON IS TAPPING INTO.\nTHERE'S A RESPONSE TO THAT PIVOT THAT KATY WAS TALKING ABOUT.\nTRUMP TRYING TO APPEAL TO MINORITIES.\nSHE'S TRYING TO SHUT THAT DOWN, KEEP HER HIGH NUMBERS.\nTHERE'S A NEW POLL RESPONDING TO DONALD TRUMP'S QUESTIONS, WHAT\nDO YOU HAVE TO LOSE. SHE SAYS EVERYTHING.\nBUT THE OTHER AUDIENCE FOR THAT ARE THE SOFT REPUBLICANS AND\nINDEPENDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN TURNED OFF BY TRUMP WHO MIGHT\nNOW START BEGINNING TO TAKE A LOOK, SHE'S SAYING DON'T BE\nFOOLED. HE'S STILL TOXIC AND NOT NORMAL.\nREALLY TRYING TO DRIVE A WEDGE AND MAKE THEM UNCOMFORTABLE AND\nPEEL OFF SOME OF THE SOFT REPUBLICANS FROM HIM.\n>> ALEX, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. JUST TO THAT POINT, JUST EARLIER\nTHIS WEEK IT WAS ON SUNDAY IN ARIZONA, WE HAD SENATOR FLAKE\nSAYING THE RNC SHOULD SHIFT SOME OF ITS FINANCES DOWN-BALLOT AND\nTHE OTHER DAY TWEETING HE APPRECIATED THE FACT THAT DONALD\nTRUMP WAS CHANGING HIS LANGUAGE. SO WE HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON\nWHICH WAY THESE FOLKS ARE GOING TO TURN F THEY TURN AT ALL.\nTHANK YOU. THE POLITICS REPORTER FOR\nPOLITICO JOINS US. IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE.\nI WANT TO START WITH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\nWE HAVE TRUMP CAMPAIGN SURROGATES AT A LOSS WITH THE\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN AND DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF CALLING HILLARY CLINTON\nA BIGOT. TAKE A LOOK AT THE CONVERSATION\nMY COLLEAGUE HAD WITH THE RNC'S COMMUNICATION DIRECTOR SHAWN\nSPICER EARLIER TODAY. >> DONALD TRUMP CALLED HILLARY\nCLINTON A BIGOT. THAT'S NOT DESPERATE?\nHOLD ON. LISTEN.\nIF YOU'RE SAYING THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS PIVOTING, I WOULD\nLIKE YOU TO NOT PIVOT. DONALD TRUMP CALLED HER A BIGOT.\n>> I'M NOT PIVOTING. WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON SAYS A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP.\nSHE PUTS OUT A VIDEO ASSOCIATING WITH OUTLANDISH THINGS LIKE THE\nWHITE SUPREMACISTS AND TRYING TO TAKE THAT LANE.\nLOOK WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAYS. AT SOME POINT SOMEONE HAS TO\nLOOK AT WHAT HILLARY CLINTON NOT ONLY SAID BUT WHAT SHE'S DONE.\nSHE'S PIVOTING BECAUSE SHE RECOGNIZES THE FOUNDATION IS HER\nACHILLES HEEL. >> OUTLANDISH.\nIT IS NOT OUTLANDISH TO GO AFTER HILLARY CLINTON'S, FOR RUDY\nGIULIANI TO SAY GOOGLE HILLARY CLINTON AND HEALTH.\nTHAT'S NOT OUTLANDISH? >> WHAT I'M SAYING IS --\n>> SHAWN, PLEASE ANSWER MY QUESTION.\nIS THAT NOT OUTLANDISH? >> I AM.\nWHAT I'M ANSWERING IS THE FACT THAT HOW COME ONLY DONALD TRUMP\nAND HIS SUPPORTERS GET HELD TO ONE STANDARD AND HILLARY CLINTON\nAND THOSE PEOPLE PUT OUT IS WASHED BY THE WAYSIDE.\nTHE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT --\n>> THE AP STORY WITHOUT A DOUBT WENT AFTER HILLARY CLINTON.\nSHE HAS HAD ONE OF THE WORST WEEKS EVER GETTING PUMMELLED BY\nTHE MEDIA. SO I DON'T REALLY BELIEVE IT'S\nFAIR TO SAY WE DON'T TAKE A LOOK AT HILLARY.\nBUT I WANT TO GO BACK TO DONALD. HE CALLED HILLARY CLINTON A\nBIGOT. WITH ALL THE THINGS HE HAD COULD\nGO AFTER HER FOR, DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT?\nHE CALLED HER A BIGOT. >> WHAT HIS POINT WAS THAT THE\nPOLICIES SHE'S SUPPORTING IS OUT THERE TRYING TO REACH OUT TO\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS AND TELL THEM THERE'S A BETTER WAY.\nHER POLICIES HAVE KEPT PEOPLE TRAPPED IN POVERTY.\nTHERE'S GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS THROUGH THEIR POLICY ISES THAT\nHAVE GOTTEN NOWHERE. SHE'S ATTACKING HIM.\nTHIS IS RIDICULOUS. >> SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?\nI'M WATCHING THAT. YOU CAN SEE HIM TRYING TO SPIN\nHIS WAY OUT. >> DID HE ACTUALLY ANSWER THE\nQUESTION? >> AS THE STANDARD BARER, PEOPLE\nWITHIN THE PARTY WHO ARE PROUD MEMBERS OF THIS PARTY, THE\nTRADITIONS THAT IT STANDS FOR ARE NOW LEFT TO HOLD THE BAG FOR\nTHIS KIND OF LANGUAGE, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHERE THEY DON'T WANT TO\nBE. >> YOU CAN SEE HIM STRUGGLING\nWITH IT. HE WANTS TO BE OUT THERE\nDEFENDING HIS PARTY'S CANDIDATE. >> WHERE DOES THE PARTY GO FROM\nHERE IF THIS IS THE STANDARD BARER AND HE LOSES?\n>> THAT'S A HUGE QUESTION. THERE'S A LOT OF REBUILDING TO\nDO AND A LOT OF RETHINKING. IT WILL BE A FRACTURED PARTY.\nI THINK WHAT THE NEW -- WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS STEER HIM AWAY\nFROM SAYING THINGS LIKE HILLARY CLINTON IS IS A BIGOT AND\nMAINSTREAM HIM AND MAKE HIM MORE APPEALING AND BACK AWAY FROM\nPERSONAL ATTACKS. SHE SAID HE DOESN'T MAKE\nPERSONAL ATTACKS. AND MAKE HIM MORE PALETTABLE AND\nNOT THIS KIND OF YELLING CONTEST.\nI JUST LIKE THAT BOTH CAMPAIGNS NOW ARE SAYING WE'RE TREATED\nUNFAIRLY. THAT'S WHERE WE ARE NOW.\n>> AND THE CHARACTERIZATION OF THE LANGUAGE THAT'S BEING USED\nBECAUSE IT WAS DONALD TRUMP JUST A SHORT TIME AGO.\nHE'S MAKING THIS APPEAL TO MINORITY VOTERS, BLACK VOTERS\nAND HISPANIC VOTERS, BUT THIS WAS BROUGHT UP WITH THE FACT\nTHAT KELLY WAS BROUGHT ON BOARD, BUT STEVE BAN NONAND THAT'S THE\nMESSAGE GIVEN YESTERDAY. SO HOW DOES DONALD TRUMP TRY TO\nEXPLAIN THAT AWAY WHEN HE BRINGS ON A BAN NONCHARACTER.\n>> DONALD IS NOT REACHING OUT TO THE MINORITY COMMUNITY.\nHE'S REACHING OUT TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPORTING HIM AND GIVE\nING THEM MESSAGES TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT HIM.\nTHE BLACK COMMUNITY IS AWARE NOT ONLY OF DONALD'S REMARKS, BUT\nDONALD HAS BEEN FOUND BY THE NEW JERSEY CONTROL COMMISSION TO\nDISCRIMINATED AGAINST BLACKS, WOMEN AND HAS BEEN FINED FOR IT.\nTHEY ARE TRYING TO PUT PEOPLE INTO WELFARE.\nNO, THEY ARE QUALIFIED RENTERS THAT WERE TURNED AWAY.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS ASSOCIATED HIMSELF WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE\nCALLING THEMSELVES THE AL IT-RIGHT SAYING WE'RE WHITE\nSUPREMACISTS AND WE'RE IN FAVOR OF A WHITE AMERICA.\nHE'S ASSOCIATED HIMSELVES WITH THEM.\nREPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN TRYING FOR YEARS TO SHED THIS SUGGESTION\nTHAT THEY ARE RACISTS. FOR THEM, IT'S A TERRIBLE\nPROBLEM. BECAUSE THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE\nWILLING TO WALK AWAY FROM HIM. >> WE KNOW THAT AS STEPHANIE\nPOINTED OUT THIS WEEK, NOT THE BEST START FOR HILLARY CLINTON\nWITH THIS RELEASE OF 15,000 MORE E-MAILS THAT SOME WOULD PORTRAY\nAS IMPROPER TIES BETWEEN THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION. TO SAY THAT IT WAS PAY-FOR-PLAY\nKIND OF ACCESS. TODAY WE HAD HILLARY CLINTON ON\n\"MORNING JOE.\" SHE ANSWERED QUESTIONS ABOUT\nTHAT. TAKE A LISTEN.\n>> I THINK IT'S REALLY FAIR TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE WORK THAT THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION HAS DONE AND TAKE THE TIME TO HEAR ABOUT IT.\nWHICH IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING.\nTHERE'S SO MUCH MORE YOU CAN DO AS PRESIDENT, OBVIOUSLY.\nI GUESS THE QUESTION WOULD BE ARE YOU CERTAIN THAT THERE ARE\nNO E E-MAILS OR FOUNDATION TIES TO FOREIGN ENTITIES THAT WILL BE\nREVEALED THAT COULD PERHAPS PERMANENTLY IMPACT YOUR\nPRESIDENTIAL PROSPECTS. >> MIKA, I AM SURE, AND I AM\nSURE BECAUSE I HAVE A VERY STRONG UNDERSTANDING OF THE\nFOUNDATION. THE KIND OF WORK THAT THE\nFOUNDATION HAS DONE THIS ATTRACTED DONORS FROM AROUND THE\nWORLD IS WORK THAT WENT RIGHT INTO PROVIDING SERVICES TO\nPEOPLE AS HAVE SAID BEFORE AND HAVE NEVER TAKEN A PENNY OF\nSALARY FROM THE FOUNDATION. MY WORK AS SECRETARY OF STATE\nWAS NOT INFLUENCED BY ANY OUTSIDE FORCES.\nI MADE POLICY DECISION BASED ON WHAT I THOUGHT WAS RIGHT TO KEEP\nAMERICANS SAFE AND PROTECT OUR INTERESTS ABROAD.\nI BELIEVE MY AIDS ACTED APPROPRIATELY.\nWE HAVE GONE ABOVE AND BEYOND MOST OF THE CHARITIES THAT I\nUNDERSTAND, BEYOND STANDARDS TO VOLUNTARILY DISCLOSE DONORS.\nAND ALSO TO REDUCE SOURCES OF FUNDING THAT RAISED ANY\nQUESTIONS NOT THAT WE THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE NECESSARILY\nLEGITIMATE, BUT TO AVOID THOSE QUESTIONS.\n>> IS THIS THE BIGGEST CONCERN? I WANT TO ASK BOTH OF YOU THIS.\nWE HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE. THE FACT THAT SHE AND HER\nHUSBAND CAN HAVE EQUALLY IMPACTFUL POLITICAL CAREERS BUT\nTHEY CAN'T BE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE IN TERMS OF WHAT THE CAREERS\nMEAN. THE TIES ARE JUST KIND OF\nMUDDYING THE WATERS. >> I DON'T THINK THEY ARE GOING\nTO SOLVE THE FOUNDATION ISSUE AND CONVINCE VOTERS OF THEIR\nVIEW OF IT. I DON'T THINK THEY ARE GOING TO\nSOFL THE E E-MAIL ISSUE. THERE'S AN AWARENESS THAT THOSE\nARE JUST ISSUES THEY WILL HAVE TO LIVE WITH LIKE A TUMOR.\nAND THE BEST CASE SCENARIO FOR THEM IS TO SHIFT THE\nCONVERSATION LIKE SHE DID YESTERDAY AND TIE TRUMP TO THE\nALT-RIGHT MOVEMENT AND MAKE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT SOMETHING\nELSE. I THINK SHE CAN TRY AND CHIP\nAWAY AT THE FEELINGS ABOUT THE FOUNDATION AND E-MAILS, BUT I\nTHINK IT'S NOT GOING TO EVER BE A WINNING POSITION FOR HER.\n>> IS THAT THE BIGGEST CONCERN? ANOTHER SHOE COULD DROP.\n>> I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY OR REPUBLICAN\nPARTY. HERE'S WHAT I DO KNOW.\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS PROBLEMS IN THIS AREA, BUT WHAT ABOUT DONALD\nTRUMP'S WELL DOCUMENTED ASSOCIATIONS WITH A MAJOR DRUG\nTRAFFICKER HE WENT TO BAT FOR THAT I TELL ABOUT IN MY BOOK.\nTHE VIOLENT FELON AND $40 MILLION STOCK SWINDLE, ALL THE\nLAWSUITS ACCUSING HIM OF SWINDLING PEOPLE, THE WORKERS HE\nREFUSED TO PAY AFTER ONLY GETTING $4 AN HOUR AND ILLEGAL\nIMMIGRANTS IN THIS COUNTRY. DONALD HAS A LIFELONG HISTORY OF\nINVOLVEMENT WITH MAFIA, RUSSIAN MOBSTERS, CON ARTISTS, WHY ARE\nWE NOT TALKING ABOUT THESE ASSOCIATIONS WITH CRIMINALS,\nREFUSAL TO PAY VENDERS, SMALL BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN\nDAMAGED AND PUT OUT OF BUSINESS. WHY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT E-MAILS\nINSTEAD OF THESE CLOSE ASSOCIATIONS WITH CRIMINALS?\n>> IT IS ALL FAIR GAME. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT ON THIS\nNETWORK EXTENSIVELY ABOUT WHAT IS FACT.\nE WE KNOW MORE IF WE WERE ABLE TO GET OUR HANDS ON THE TAXES OF\nDONALD TRUMP AND THAT REMAINS ILLUSIVE AT THE TIME.\nI WANT TO GET Y RESPONSE TO THE PULSE QUESTION.\nHILLARY CLINTON STOPPED SHORT OF CALL LG DONALD TRUMP A RACIST ON\n\"MORNING JOE.\" DO YOU THINK HIS COMMENTS\nTHROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN HAVE EXPOSED HIM AS A RACIST?\nTHE RESULTS SO FAR, 97% THINK YES, 3% SAY NO.\nCHECK OUT THE PULSE.

HERE'S THE THING, KASIE, IT\nWOULD SEEM THAT HILLARY CLINTON COULD HAVE EASILY PAINTED THE\nENTIRE PARTY WITH TRUMP'S COMMENTS.\nBUT SHE DIDN'T. SHE CHOSE TO JUST FOCUS ON\nDONALD TRUMP. WHY?\n>> WELL, IT'S A SWITCH FOR THE CLINTONS FIRST OF ALL WHO HAVE\nBEEN VERY FOCUSSED ON REPUBLICANS FOR DECADES, AND\nIT'S DIFFERENT FROM WHAT OTHER DEMOCRATS ARE DOING.\nDEMOCRATS WHO ARE RUNNING FOR THE HOUSE, THE SENATE, TRYING TO\nTIE THEM TO DONALD TRUMP. FOR HILLARY CLINTON, THE GOAL\nHERE TO WIN THE WHITE HOUSE, SHE WANTS TO APPEAL TO THE\nREPUBLICANS, MODERATE REPUBLICANS, SWING VOTERS,\nINDEPENDENTS, SUBURBAN WOMEN.

THIS IDEA THAT IT COULD VALIDATE\nFOR SOME OF THESE LONG-TIME REPUBLICANS THE IDEA OF NOT\nVOTING FOR SOMEBODY ON THEIR TICKET THEY HAVE FOR YEARS AND\nYEARS. >> YOU KNOW HOW IT CAN BE IN\nYOUR NEIGHBORHOOD, ALL MY NEIGHBORS, ALWAYS VOTED\nREPUBLICAN, I CAN'T IMAGINE I WOULD DO ANYTHING ELSE, THE\nHILLARY CLINTON TEAM IS TRYING TO GET TO THOSE PEOPLE.\n>> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S BEEN STRIKING OVER THE LAST 48 HOURS,\nTHE SILENCE HAS BEEN DEAFING. AND WHETHER IT'S E-MAIL --\nREPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN GOING AFTER HILLARY CLINTON FOR THE\nBETTER PART OF THE LAST YEAR, SOME OF THIS STUFF, BUT WITH\nREGARD TO THE BIGOTRY, CRICKETS, WHY IS THAT?\nWHY HASN'T BEEN BEEN AT LEAST ONE PROMINENT REPUBLICAN WHO'S\nSAID, DONALD TRUMP'S HE'S GOT SOMETHING HERE.\nNO ONE'S SAYING THAT? >> IT'S NOT CRICKETS WHEN YOU\nLOOK AT THE STATEMENTS FROM MITCH McCONNELL AND PAUL RYAN,\nTHEY DIDN'T WATCH THE SPEECH. THEY DIDN'T SEE IT.\n>> I'M SURE NO ONE HAS FORWARDED A COPY OF THEM OR SENT THEM A\nLINK TO IT. >> PROVIDING YOU THE INFORMATION\nWHICH IS PROVIDED TO US. YOUR QUESTION SPEAKS TO THE WHY\nFACTOR. I THINK THAT IS A QUESTION --\nLISTEN, YOU KNOW WHEN CONGRESS COMES BACK INTO SESSION, THESE\nREPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO BE FACING QUESTIONS ON CAPITOL HILL\nABOUT THIS. THEY'RE GOING TO FACE ABOUT\nTHESE COMMENTS THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS KNEAD WHILE THEY HAVE BEEN\nIN RECESS. SOME OF THEM WE CATCH UP WITH ON\nTHE ROAD OR AT HOME, BUT THEY WILL BILLION PRESSED ABOUT THIS.\nAND THAT QUESTION, YOU SAW STEPHANIE RULE ASK SEAN SPICER,\nYOU'VE SEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE PRESS REPUBLICANS ON IS HILLARY\nCLINTON IS BIGOT? REPUBLICANS WILL GET THIS\nQUESTION FOR WEEKS TO COME. >> LET'S TALK IMMIGRATION HERE,\nKASIE HUNT, THE CONFUSION CONTINUES HERE.\nI WANT TO PLAY SOME OF THE VARYING ANSWERS THAT THE TRUMP\nTEAM HAS GIVEN ABOUT DEPORTATION.\nWE'LL START WITH HIS LAST COMMENT.\nHERE IS OUR SOUND MONTAGE, IF YOU WILL.\n>> WELL L THAT PLAN INCLUDE A DEPORTATION FORCE?\n>> TO BE A DETERMINED. >> THERE'S NO AMNESTY.\n>> RIGHT. >> BUT WE WORK WITH THEM.\n>> IF YOU HAVEN'T COMMITTED A CRIME AND BEEN HERE FOR 15 YEARS\nAND YOU HAVE A FAMILY HERE, JOB HERE, WILL YOU BE DEPORTED?\n>> WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS ONCE WE STRENGTHEN UP\nOUR BORDER, BUT THERE IS A VERY GOOD CHANCE THE ANSWER COULD BE\nYES, WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS.\n>> WE TALKED A FEW HOURS AGO, HAS ANYTHING CHANGED?\nDO WE KNOW MORE ABOUT WHERE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN STANDS ON\nIMMIGRATION REFORM? >> IT'S THE TRIPLE FLIP.\nI THINK YOU'VE GOT TO GO WITH WHATEVER TRUMP LAST SAID.\n>> CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, LAST -- BUT WE SHOULD NOTE HERE\nSEAN SPICER DURING THAT SAME INTERVIEW, SEAN SAID THAT THEY\nWOULD DEPORT 11 MILLION PEOPLE AND THEN SOME OF THEM WOULD COME\nBACK AFTER THIS EXTREME VETTING PROCESS.\nIS THAT THE LATEST IT RATION OF --\n>> SURE, BUT THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT POLICY LOOKS LIKE.\nWHAT DOES EXTREME VETTING MEAN? WHAT DOES THAT CONSTITUTE?\nWHAT DOES THAT POLICY MEAN? DONALD TRUMP IS DOING WHAT HE'S\nDONE OFTEN WHICH IS PROMISING MORE DETAILS TO COME.\nHE IS SAYING THAT IN THE NEXT WEEK TO TWO WEEKS, THIS IS WHAT\nHE'S SAYING, HE WILL GIVE AND HIS CAMPAIGN, HE WILL BE GIVING\nA SPEECH FLUSHING OUT THE DETAILS OF THESE POLICIES.\nLET'S SEE. >> LOOK, I THINK CLEARLY\nSOMEBODY INSIDE TRUMP'S CIRCLE HAS CONVINCED HIM OF WHAT THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY HAS BEEN ARGUING FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS.\nWHICH IS THAT, YOU HAVE TO BRING IN MORE VOTERS IF YOU HAVE ANY\nHOPE OF WINNING THE WHITE HOUSE. SO, THAT'S FINALLY GOTTEN THROW\nHIM.

YOUNG REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE\nGOTTEN MIND  BEHIND HIM AND SAY HE IS THEIR VOICE.\nBUT WHEN YOU SEE IN THE LAST 48 HOURS THE TALK OF RACE AND\nHILLARY CLINTON'S ARGUMENT R TRYING TO LINK DONALD TRUMP TO\nTHE SUPREMACISTS, HOW DOES THAT GO WITH YOURSELF, WHO IS OF\nCOLOR AND EDUCATED. >> I THINK DONALD TRUMP\nDEFINITELY HAS MADE A LOT OF VERY IMMATURE COMMENTS IN THAT\nWAY. AND FOR SOMEONE AS A YOUNG\nREPUBLICAN WHO MAY OR MAY NOT STILL BE TRYING TO ALIGN WITH A\nCERTAIN PARTY, I THINK THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE OF MY\nAGE TO AGREE WITH THE THINGS THAT HE IS SAYING, AND TO\nPUBLICLY ENDORSE HIM AS A CANDIDATE.\nWHILE IN THE BEGINNING, BEFORE THESE COMMENTS WERE TAKEN\nSERIOUSLY AND MORE WERE MADE, A LOT OF YOUNGER REPUBLICANS AND\nYOUNGER VOTERS IN GENERAL HAVE BEEN ALIGNING WITH THE THINGS\nTHAT HE HAS SAID. BUT NOW AS THINGS HAVE COME\nALONG, I THINK THAT IT'S VERY, VERY DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO\nENDORSE HIM. >> YOU USE THE WORD IMMATURE.\nTHIS MORNING HILLARY CLINTON WAS ASKED IF SHE THOUGHT DONALD\nTRUMP WAS A RACIST. SHE WOULD NOT ANSWER THAT.\nI'M CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR CHOICE OF THE WORD THAT HE WAS BEING\nIMMATURE AND WHEN -- I POINTED THIS OUT EARLIER, EVERYONE SAYS\nSOME OF THIS LANGUAGE IS RECENT. THE FIRST SPEECH HE GAVE SAYING\nTHAT HE WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT INCLUDED THE NOW\nINFAMOUS WORDS ABOUT MEXICANS AND MEXICO SENDING ITS RAPISTS.\nSO THIS WAS STARTED OUT THE BLOCK.\n>> YES, I AGREE. I THINK WHEN I SAY IMMATURE, I\nMEAN THAT A LOT OF OTHER POLITICIANS WOULDN'T NECESSARILY\nBE SO POLITICALLY INCORRECT, IF I MUST SAY.\nAND A LOT OF PEOPLE KEY IN NECESSARILY SAY THEY AGREE WITH\nTHE THINGS HE SAYS. BECAUSE HIS COMMENTS AREN'T VERY\nPROFESSIONAL. I THINK THAT HE'S -- REMEMBER\nTHAT -- LOOK AT THE AUDIENCE HE IS SPEAKING WITH.\nIT'S VERY HARD FOR PEOPLE TO REALLY AGREE WITH WHAT HE SAYS.\n>> MIGUEL, IS IT TOO LATE FOR DONALD TRUMP TO PIVOT IF HE\nCHANGES HIS LANGUAGE? HIS TONE, AS YOU AND SAPPA HAVE\nPOINTED OUT. IS IT TOO LATE FOR HIM TO GET\nYOUR VOTE? >> WELL, WHAT I WOULD TELL\nPEOPLE IS, YOU KNOW, I DON'T TAKE ANY OF DONALD TRUMP'S\nPOLICIES SERIOUSLY. I DON'T.\nWHAT I TAKE MORE SERIOUSLY, TAMRON, IS THE KIND OF PERSON\nWHO SAYS THOSE THINGS. YOU KNOW, THE CHARACTER OF THE\nPERSON WHO DEMEANS WOMEN, BANS AN ENTIRE RELIGION FROM AMERICA.\nAND AT THE END OF THE DAY, I THINK MILLENNIALS AND MINORITIES\nSEE THAT DONALD TRUMP IS DONALD TRUMP.\nAND HE CAN SHUFFLE STAFF AROUND. HE CAN TONE DOWN HIS\nRHETORIC OR SOFTEN HIS POLICIES, BUT MILLENNIALS AND MINORITIES\nWITH, THEY SEE THROUGH THAT. AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE\nTHE IMPACT OF THAT COME NOVEMBER.\n>> MIGUEL, THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR TIME, GREATLY APPRECIATE\nIT.",

BUT GOING BACK TO WHETHER OR NOT\nTHIS WAS A PIVOT FROM THE CLINTON FOUNDATION CONVERSATION,\nIT SEEMS AS IF THIS WAS A PART OF THE PLAN ALL ALONG.\nI TALKED WITH BRIAN FALLON YESTERDAY AND ASKED, WHEN WAS\nTHE SPEECH PLANNED AND HE SAID SOME TIME BACK.\nLOOKING BACK AT THE CHICAGO SITUATION WHEN HIS SPEECH --\nDONALD TRUMP'S SPEECH WAS SHUT DOWN AND SOME OF THIS OTHER\nACTIVITY, THE MAN IN FLORIDA, WITH THE CONFEDERATE FLAG THAT\nTHEY ASKED TO TAKE DOWN. THIS WAS NOT A HARD CASE FOR HER\nTO PUT TOGETHER. >> AND IT FOLLOWS, I THINK, A\nPATTERN THAT THEY HAVE SET OUT OF DOING SPEECHES ON -- IT\nSTARTED WITH THE NATIONAL SECURITY SPEECH.\nTHEY CALLED IT A NATIONAL SECURITY SPEECH.\nREALLY IT WAS A POLITICAL SPEECH ABOUT WHY HE WAS UNFIT TO BE\nCOMMANDER IN CHIEF. I THINK THIS SPEECH FITS INTO\nTHAT KIND OF PATTERN WITH A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT ANGLE.\nI WILL SAY, THOUGH, SHE IS AT THE TOP OF THE SPEECH,\nORIGINALLY A JOBS EVENT. THEY SAW AN OPPORTUNITY HERE\nWITH -- BETWEEN THE HIRING OF STEVE BANNON AND THEN DONALD\nTRUMP'S ATTEMPTS TO REACH OUT TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS OR HISPANICS,\nOR AT LEAST -- THAT'S WHAT HE IS SAYING HE IS DOING.\nAND THEY REALIZED, HEY, THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY HERE FOR US, AND,\nIN FACT, MAYBE A NEED TO PUSH BACK ON THIS.\nAND THIS WAS -- AS MUCH ABOUT REPUBLICANS, MODERATE\nREPUBLICANS, AS IT IS ABOUT AFRICAN-AMERICANS.\n>> WHICH IS A GOOD POINT. SHE IN HER REMARKS YESTERDAY,\nSECRETARY CLINTON, AS WELL AS TODAY, BROUGHT UP GEORGE BUSH\nAFTER 9/11 GOING TO THE MOSQUE. SHE BROUGHT UP SENATOR McCAIN ON\nTHE CAMPAIGN TRAIL STANDING UP TO ONE OF HIS SUPPORTERS WHO\nSAID THAT OBAMA WAS A MUSLIM. THESE OTHER MOMENTS WHERE\nREPUBLICANS WERE CALLED TO FIND THEIR HIGHER VOICE, AND REFUTE\nSOME OF THE THINGS BEING SAID. >> AND THIS IS A WOMAN, A\nFAMILY, THE CLINTONS, WHO HAVE RAILED AGAINST REPUBLICANS,\nWORKED AGAINST REPUBLICANS THEIR ENTIRE CAREERS.\nSOME OF THE RHETORIC THEY HAVE USED OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF\nDECADES WOULD SUGGEST THEY DON'T HAVE VERY MANY FRIENDS IN THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY. BUT THIS -- IN THIS CASE, SHE\nSEPARATED REPUBLICANISM, CONSERVATISM, AWAY FROM THIS\nALT-RIGHT, AND FROM DONALD TRUMP.\nAND I THINK SHE WAS TRYING TO GIVE SOME SPACE TO THOSE\nREPUBLICANS TO SAY, HEY, YOU KNOW, IT'S OKAY, YOU CAN COME\nOVER HERE WITHOUT REJECTING THE GOP.\nIT'S REALLY INTERESTING ARGUMENT.\n>> IT IS. LET ME BRING IN NOW OUR\nCOLLEAGUE, KATY TUR, OUTSIDE TRUMP TOWER HERE IN NEW YORK.\nAND KATIE, DONALD TRUMP SAID YESTERDAY THAT THIS WAS THE\nOLDEST ARGUMENT IN THE DEMOCRATIC PLAYBOOK.\nI THINK WE HAVE THE SOUND FROM HIM, WHERE HE REFERS TO THIS AS\nA PLAYBOOK MOVE BY DEMOCRATS. CAN CAN WE PLAY THAT FIRST?\n>> IT IS TERRIFIC TO BE BACK IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.\n[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] REALLY A VERY SPECIAL PLACE TO\nBE, BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE I WON MY FIRST PRIMARY.\nMY FIRST VICTORY. WHO KNOWS?\nIF I DIDN'T WIN HERE, WHO KNOWS WHERE I WOULD BE.\nMAYBE I WOULD BE BUILDING BUILDINGS OR SOMETHING.\nBUT WHO KNOWS? BUT I WANT TO JUST THANK\nEVERYBODY. IT'S THE OLDEST PLAY IN THE\nDEMOCRATIC PLAYBOOK. WHEN DEMOCRATIC POLICIES FAIL,\nTHEY ARE LEFT WITH ONLY THIS ONE TIRED ARGUMENT.\nYOU'RE RACIST, YOU'RE RACIST, YOU'RE RACIST.\nTHEY KEEP SAYING IT. YOU'RE RACIST.\nIT'S A TIRED, DISGUSTING ARGUMENT.\n>> SO KATIE, THAT'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY.\nDID THE CAMPAIGN -- WERE THEY CAUGHT OFF GUARD BY THIS PRETTY\nHARD-HITTING ASSAULT FROM CLINTON?\n>> YOU KNOW, IT WAS. I CAN TELL YOU, THE CAMPAIGN\nCAME DIRECTLY OUT TO ME ONCE THEY SAW THAT INITIAL AD THAT\nCAME OUT, WHERE HILLARY CLINTON TRIED TO LINK DONALD TRUMP AND\nHIS RHETORIC WITH WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND ALSO SHOW THAT\nWHITE SUPREMACISTS WERE SUPPORTING DONALD TRUMP.\nTHEY PUSHED BACK IMMEDIATELY, AND THEY PUSHED BACK FORCEFULLY.\nCLEARLY, THIS IS A MESSAGE THAT THEY ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO.\nAND THEY REALIZED THAT THERE IS A WEAK SPOT HERE, BECAUSE\nFRANKLY, HILLARY CLINTON WAS USING DONALD TRUMP'S OWN WORDS\nAGAINST HIM, HIS OWN PAST STATEMENTS, AND THEY WERE USING\nVIDEO OF WHITE SUPREMACISTS, A MAN IN A CUE CLUBS CAN CLAN CAST\nTUMOR SAYING HE WAS A SUPPORTER OF DONALD TRUMP AND WHY HE\nBELIEVES THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS A SUPPORTER OF HIS.\nAND HIS BELIEF SYSTEM. SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE\nCAMPAIGN DOES NOT WANT OUT THERE, THEY DO NOT WANT THAT\nMESSAGE TO RESONATE. THEY DON'T WANT THAT IDEA TO\nRESONATE. THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO COMBAT\nDONALD TRUMP AS A RACIST. THAT BELIEF THAT MANY AMERICANS\nHOLD FOR A WHILE NOW. TRYING TO TAILOR THEIR MESSAGE\nTO AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS, TAILOR THEIR MESSAGE TO LATINO\nVOTERS. IT'S NOT GETTING ACROSS TO THEM\nSO FAR. WE HAVE BEEN AT RALLIES IN\nPLACES WHERE THERE'S 80% AFRICAN-AMERICAN POPULATIONS,\nLIKE JACKSON, MISSISSIPPI, AND STILL, THE MAJORITY OF HIS RALLY\nCROWD WAS WHITE. THE VAST MAJORITY WAS WHITE.\nSO THAT MESSAGE MIGHT NOT BE GETTING ACROSS TO THE\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS OR THE LATINO COMMUNITIES, MAKING MANY WONDER\nIF HIS MESSAGE IS REALLY TRYING TO GET MODERATE GOP VOTERS ON\nHIS SIDE, MORE COMFORTABLE WITH HIM.\n>> ALL RIGHT, KATY TUR, LIVE AT TRUMP TOWER FOR US.\nTHANK YOU. AND LET ME BRING IN NATIONALLY\nSYNDICATED RADIO HOST FROM IOWA, STEVE DAIS WHO ENDORSED TED CRUZ\nAND WASHINGTON POST NATIONAL REPORTER, NBC NEWS POLITICAL\nANALYST, ROBERT COSTA, ROBERT, I'LL START WITH YOU, PICKING UP\nON WHAT KATY TUR COMMENTED ON, WHETHER OR NOT THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN SAW THIS COMING, THAT THIS ROLLOUT FROM HILLARY\nCLINTON TWO DAYS NOW IN A ROW LAYING OUT THE CASE, LINKING HIM\nTO THE ALT-RIGHT. >> THAT'S TRUE.\nTHE CAMPAIGN DID EXPECT TO SEE IT FROM THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN.\nI THINK IT'S INDICATIVE OF WHAT WE CAN EXPECT TO SEE IN THE\nFINAL 75 DAYS OF THIS ELECTION, A BRUTISH, BRUTAL FIGHT THAT\nGOES BEYOND THE NORMAL PARTISAN LINES WE USUALLY SEE IN A\nGENERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN. THIS IS ABOUT POPULISM,\nNATIONALISM, ACCUSATIONS OF RACISM.\nAND THIS IS THE KIND OF RACE WE'RE SEEING.\n>> AND STEVE, THIS, AS KASIE HUNT REPORTED, WAS NOT\nNECESSARILY PLANNED. HILLARY CLINTON WAS SUPPOSED TO\nGIVE A SPEECH ON JOBS, PIVOTING, SEEING AN OPENING AFTER THE\nCAMPAIGN -- TRUMP CAMPAIGN BROUGHT IN STEVE BANNON FROM\nBREITBART. HERE'S WHAT SHE SAID ABOUT STEVE\nBANNON, CEO OF BREITBART.COM. >> HE HIRED STEPHEN BANNON, THE\nHEAD OF A RIGHT WING WEBSITE CALLED BREITBART.COM, AS THE\nCAMPAIGN CEO. HERE ARE A FEW HEADLINES THEY\nHAVE PUBLISHED. AND I'M NOT MAKING THIS UP.\n\"BIRTH CONTROL MAKES WOMEN UNATTRACTIVE AND CRAZY.\"\n\"HOISTED HIGH AND PROUD, THE CONFEDERATE FLAG PROCLAIMS A\nGLORIOUS HERITAGE.\" AND THAT ONE CAME SHORTLY AFTER\nTHE CHARLESTON MASSACRE, WHEN DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ALIKE\nWERE DOING EVERYTHING THEY COULD TO HEAL RACIAL DIVIDES.\nACCORDING TO THE SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER, WHICH TRACKS\nHATE GROUPS, BREITBART EMBRACES IDEAS ON THE EXTREMIST FRINGE OF\nTHE CONSERVATIVE RIGHT. >> ARE YOU EMBRACING THE\nALT-RIGHT MOVEMENT? >> NOBODY EVEN KNOWS WHAT IT IS.\nTHIS IS A TERM THAT -- FRANKLY, THERE IS NO ALT-RIGHT OR\nALT-LEFT. ALL I'M EMBRACING IS COMMON\nSENSE. >> STEPHEN BANNON SAID BREITBART\nIS THE VOICE. >> I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE SAID.\nI CAN ONLY SPEAK FOR MYSELF. >> SO STEVE, IS THAT ENOUGH TO\nGET DONALD TRUMP OUT OF THIS YARD?\nYOU'RE SHAKING YOUR HEAD. >> I DON'T THINK THIS ENTIRE\nTHING JUST GOES TO SHOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE COUNTRY\nNOMINATES PEOPLE THAT A SUPER MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION\nTHINKS ARE DISHONEST AND IN HILLARY'S CASE, AND CRAZY IN\nDONALD TRUMP'S CASE. I MEAN, THE IDEA, FOR EXAMPLE,\nTHAT BREITBART AND THE SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER ARE BEING\nQUOTED BY BOTH MAJOR PARTY CANDIDATES WHEN THEY REPRESENT\nTHE WORST ELEMENTS OF EACH SIDE'S BASE IS REALLY JUST\nPREPOSTEROUS, TAMRON, AS IS THE FACT THAT DONALD TRUMP NOW BY\nHIS OWN ADMISSION INVITED A BIGOT TO HIS WEDDING, AND\nHILLARY CLINTON BY HER OWN ADMISSION WENT TO THE WEDDING OF\nA BIGOT. THAT'S WHERE WE ARE WHEN YOU\nHAVE CANDIDATES THAT ARE REALLY OUT OF IDEAS, THAT REPRESENT A\nGENERATION THAT IS SORT OF ON ITS LAST LEGS, THE BABY BOOM\nGENERATION, AND THEIR NEGATIVES ARE SO HIGH, WE'RE JUST GOING TO\nCALL NAMES AND RUN TO THE BOTTOM.\nAND THAT'S WHY SO MANY AMERICANS WANT THE SWEET METEOR OF DEATH\nTO ARRIVE BY ELECTION DAY, TAMRON.\n>> I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE NOT A FAN OF EITHER OF THESE CANDIDATES.\nBUT IN REALITY, SOMETIMES NAMES STICK BECAUSE THEY ARE TRUE.\nI'M NOT CALLING EITHER ONE OF THEM A RACIST OR A BIGOT.\nBUT SOMETIMES THESE THINGS CAN BE TRUE ABOUT AN INDIVIDUAL,\nESPECIALLY, STEVE, AT A TIME WHEN DONALD TRUMP SAYS THAT HE'S\nATTEMPTING TO BRING IN AFRICAN-AMERICANS, BRING IN\nHISPANIC VOTERS, BRING IN MINORITIES.\nWHY THEN IS IT UNFAIR TO CALL OUT SOMEONE'S RECORD OR\nSOMEONE'S LINK TO A WEBSITE WITH A TYPE OF HEADLINES THAT WERE\nFACTUAL? THOSE AREN'T MADE UP.\nTHEY MAY NOT BE PLEASANT TO HEAR, BUT THOSE ARE ACTUAL\nHEADLINES FROM THAT WEBSITE. >> OH, I DON'T THINK IT'S OUT OF\nBOUNDS AT ALL. I MEAN, IF YOU LISTEN TO MY SHOW\nEVERY NIGHT, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A HARD TIME OUTCRITICIZING\nME WHEN IT COMES TO DONALD TRUMP, ALL RIGHT?\nAND I'VE DONE THAT ON THIS NETWORK BEFORE AND LAST TIME I\nWAS ON HERE I DREW VERY STARK LINES BETWEEN WHAT CONSERVATISM\nIS AND WHITE NATIONALISM IS. DONALD TRUMP MADE HIS OWN BED.\nHE'S -- EVERYBODY HAS JUSTIFIED IT, HE CHOSE TO USE THE MOST\nINCENDIARY LANGUAGE ON EVERY ISSUE BECAUSE HE WAS TRYING TO\nESSENTIALLY RUN A CON CAMPAIGN. BUT WHEN YOU CALL ROBERT BIRD A\nFORMER CLAN LEADER, YOUR MENTOR, I'M NOT SURE YOU'RE THE ONE THAT\nNECESSARILY OUGHT TO BE THROWING STONES HERE, THAT'S ALL.\n>> SO THERE'S SO MANY THINGS HERE, I CAN'T EVEN KNOW WHERE TO\nSTART WITH THIS, STEVE. LET ME BRING IN ROBERT COSTA ON\nTHIS. FROM THE INCENDIARY LANGUAGE TO\nALL OF THE -- THE EXAGGERATIONS, QUITE HONESTLY, FROM WHAT STEVE\nJUST SAID. AND I'LL GET BACK TO YOU, STEVE,\nIN A SECOND. TO THE SUBSTANCE OF ALL OF THIS.\nWILL THIS GET SOME TRACTION FOR HILLARY CLINTON?\nHOW DOES DONALD TRUMP, IF HECA RECOVER FROM THIS -- IF THIS IS\nJUST ABOUT BRINGING IN SUBURBAN WHITE VOTERS, CAN HE RECOVER\nFROM THIS, THIS WEEKEND? WHO IS ADVISING HIM, ROBERT?\n>> WELL, THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN BELIEVES IT CAN HAVE TRACTION,\nESPECIALLY WITH SUBURBAN VOTERS IN PLACES LIKE OHIO, NORTH\nCAROLINA AND PENNSYLVANIA, WHERE RACIALLY INFLAMMATORY LANGUAGE\nOR STATEMENTS CAN OFTEN BE A REAL TURNOFF TO VOTERS, EVEN IF\nTHEY'RE INCLINED IN THE CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN\nDIRECTION. SO IF YOU'RE A CLINTON ALLY OR\nAN ADVISER AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT A SWING VOTER, THIS IS ONE OF\nTHE WAYS TO REALLY TARGET THEM. ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN ANGLE, MY\nREPORTING TELLS ME BASIC CONVERSATIONS TODAY, THAT TRUMP\nIS GOING TO CONTINUE TO TRY OUTREACH AND THOSE EFFORTS WILL\nCONTINUE WITH PEOPLE LIKE BEN CARSON GOING TO PLACES LIKE\nDETROIT. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO POLICY,\nHE'S GOING TO ALSO HAVE THINGS ON EDUCATION AND OTHER THINGS.\nBUT WE'LL JUST HAVE TO SEE, BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY ABOUT A\nDRAW BETWEEN CLINTON AND TRUMP AS CANDIDATES FIGHTING IN THE\nPUBLIC RATHER THAN SOMETHING THAT TRUMP CAN MAKE INCREMENTAL\nGAINS. >> MAGGI HAGERMAN REPORTING THAT\nTHE TRUMP TEAM IS HIRING BILL STEPIEN, FIRED BY CHRIS CHRISTIE\nAND TWO SOURCES TELLING HER ANOTHER CONTROVERSIAL PERSON\nCOULD BE JOINING. ROBERT, WHAT WITH YOU HEARING?\n>> BILL STEPIEN, SOMEBODY IMPLICATED IN THE BRIDGE GATE\nSCANDAL FOR GOVERNOR CHRISTIE BUT REMAINS A CONFIDANTE.\nDEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF FOR THE NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR.\nAS HE TRIES TO REEMERGE ON TO THE POLITICAL SCENE IT WOULD BE\nA NATURAL FIT FOR HIM TO GO WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.\n>> AND QUICKLY GOING BACK TO STEVE AND THE RHETORIC HERE.\nI GET IT, STEVE, YOU'RE NOT A FAN OF DONALD TRUMP, YOU'RE NOT\nA FAN OF HILLARY CLINTON, BUT THIS DOES AND HAS COME DOWN\nACCORDING TO PEOPLE LIKE \"MORNING JOE,\" FOR EXAMPLE, JOE SCARBOROUGH, IT COMES DOWN TO\nYOUR MORAL COMPASS HERE, AND YOUR COMPASS MAY PUT YOU IN THE\nMIDDLE OR FAR AWAY FROM BOTH OF THESE PEOPLE.\nNEVERTHELESS, YOU SOUND LIKE RUDY GUILIANI WHEN I ASK YOU\nABOUT DONALD TRUMP, PISTONS INSTANTLY TO HILLARY CLINTON.\nHE'S A PART OF YOUR PARTY, TRIED TO IDENTIFY AS A CONSERVATIVE,\nRIGHT NOW WINNING IN YOUR STATE OF IOWA.\nIS HE HURTING YOUR PARTY? NOT YOUR FEELINGS ABOUT HILLARY\nCLINTON. NOT THE THINGS THAT I THINK YOU\nBRING UP ON YOUR RADIO SHOW, AND WE'RE FRIENDS SO WE'RE BEING\nHONEST WITH EACH OTHER HERE. THE BOTTOM LINE, IS HE HURTING\nTHE GOP. PLEASE DON'T PIVOT TO YOUR\nTALKING POINTS ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON.\nIS HE HURTING YOUR PARTY? >> WELL, THEY WEREN'T TALKING\nPOINTS. THOSE THINGS ARE TRUE.\nAND HE IS ABSOLUTELY HURTING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\nTHAT'S WHY A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE ME LEFT.\nTHIS IS -- THIS IS NOT WHAT I SIGNED UP TO DO.\nI SIGNED UP TO CONSERVE VALUES THAT I THINK ARE BEST THROUGHOUT\nHISTORY FOR WHAT'S BEST FOR THE HUMAN CONDITION.\nAND DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T REPRESENT ANY OF THAT.\nI JUST THINK, THOUGH, THAT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE OTHER SIDE GETS\nA FREE SHOT WITHOUT HAVING TO DEFEND ITS OWN CREDIBILITY AT\nTHE SAME TIME. THAT'S ALL.\n>> STEVE DAIS, THANK YOU.",

BUT TO SAY THEIR BIGOTED IS\nSOMETHING ELSE THAT REALLY I THINK THAT DONALD TRUMP SHOULD\nHAVE BEEN RIGHTFULLY CHALLENGED AND THEREFORE GIVE ME YOUR\nCATEGORICAL EVIDENCE TO THAT. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, SHE GAVE\nCATEGORICAL EVIDENCE ON HER RESPONSE, SAYING THAT HE HAD\nMAIN STREAMED HATE MOVEMENTS. AND SHE WENT FROM THE CLAN OF\nDAVID DUKE AND THE PEOPLE HE IS AFFILIATED WITH.\nWHICH I THINK IS A CORRECT STATEMENT.\nSHE DIDN'T SAY HE WAS A BIGOT. SHE SAYS HE'S MAINSTREAMED A\nHATE MOVEMENT. AND THAT IS TRUE, IN MY OPINION,\nAND FRIGHTENING. I MEAN, I HAVE NEVER SEEN IN MY\nLIFETIME ANYONE THAT IS THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE ATTACK PEOPLE\nBY THEIR RELIGION OR THEIR NATIONALNALITY.\nWE'RE TALKING ABOUT A -- THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE OF ONE OF THE\nTWO MAJOR PARTIES IN THE COUNTRY, SAYING A JUDGE MADE A\nDECISION BECAUSE HE WAS MEXICAN. NOT ONLY WAS HE NOT MEXICAN, HE\nSAID BECAUSE OF HIS ORIGIN.

BUT WHAT'S ALWAYS STRUCK ME\nABOUT THAT IS THAT USING THAT SAME LOGIC, WHAT ABOUT POLICIES\nTHAT HAVE AFFLICTED POOR WHITE PEOPLE IN RED STATES, STATES\nTHAT HAVE BEEN RELIABLY RED, FOR GENERATIONS?\n>> WELL, NOT ONLY THAT, LET'S DEAL WITH THE FACTS.\nONE OF THE THINGS THAT I AM LAYING OUT ON POLICIES NATION\nSUNDAY MORNING, LET'S LOOK AT THE FACTS.\nWHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA TOOK OFFICE, BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT WAS\nAT 16.8%. IT IS NOW 8%.\nHE CUT EMPLOYMENT -- BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT IN HALF.\nSO WHAT IS TRUMP TALKING ABOUT? RONALD REAGAN LEFT, IT WAS\n11.8%. SO IF HE IS SAYING UNDER\nDEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS -- THE FACTS EVEN EVEN ADD UP.\nIN THE LAST 35, 40 YEARS, WE'VE HAD MORE REPUBLICANS IN POWER IN\nWASHINGTON. REAGAN, BUSH SENIOR, THEN BUSH\nJR. AS OPPOSED TO JUST CLINTON AND\nOBAMA. SO UNDER WHAT DEMOCRATIC\nLEADERSHIP IS HE TALKING ABOUT THAT BLACK SUFFERED, WHEN WE\nHAVE BEEN MOST OF THE TIME IN THE LAST THREE OR FOUR DECADES\nUNDER THE REPUBLICANS, AND WHEN THE DEMOCRATS WERE IN,\nUNEMPLOYMENT WENT DOWN. OUR WEALTH GAP WENT UP, ON AND\nON AND ON. SO HE'S EVEN FACTUALLY WRONG.\n>> I HAVE WONDERED WHETHER IT'S THE SPEECH IN MICHIGAN OR SOME\nOF THESE OTHER SPEECHES OR INTERVIEWS HE'S DONE SINCE THEN,\nWHEN HE TALKS ABOUT RACE IN THIS COUNTRY.\nWHEN DONALD TRUMP TALKS ABOUT RACE, IS HE -- IS HE TALKING TO\nBLACK VOTERS? IS HE TALKING TO HISPANIC\nVOTERS, OR IS THE MESSAGE DESIGNED FOR ANOTHER GROUP?\n>> NO, HE'S DEFINITELY, IN MY OPINION TRYING TO TALK TO\nINDEPENDENT WHITE VOTERS, AND SOME MODERATE REPUBLICANS THAT\nDON'T WANT TO FEEL THEY'RE VOTING FOR A RACIST OR A POLL\nRISER. I DON'T THINK HE'S TALKING TO\nBLACK VOTERS AT ALL. WHY?\nBECAUSE IF HE WAS, HE WOULD BE SAYING THIS IS WHAT I'M GOING TO\nPROPOSE TO YOU. TO SAY TO BLACK VOTERS, DON'T\nVOTE FOR THE SAME, VOTE FOR SOMETHING NEW, BUT NEVER DEFINE\nWHAT NEW IS, MEANS THEY'RE REALLY NOT TALKING TO YOU.\nBECAUSE OTHERWISE I WOULD BE SELLING YOU ON THIS IS MY NEW\nPLAN ON THE ECONOMY, THIS IS MY NEW PLAN ON HEALTH CARE.\nTHERE IS NO BLANKS. YESTERDAY HE MET WITH SOME BLACK\nREPUBLICAN LEADERS, BUT HE NEVER WALKED OUT HERE AND SAID THIS IS\nMY BLUEPRINT FOR BLACK AMERICA. BECAUSE I'M NOT TALKING TO BLACK\nAMERICA. I'M USING THE OPPOSE IT\nPARTICULARS TO TALK TO WHITES THAT DON'T WANT TO TELL THEIR\nFRIENDS THEY WOULD VOTE FOR SOMEBODY AS POLARIZING.\nSO I WANT TO INCREASE THEIR COMFORT LEVEL.\nSO THEY BECOME PROPS TO A LARGER NARRATIVE.\nAND IT'S UNFORTUNATE AND VERY CYNICAL.\n>> USING HARLAN TO WIN AN ELECTION OUT IN WESTCHESTER.\n>> RIGHT. >> POLITICS NATION THIS SUNDAY\nMORNING, 8:00 EASTERN, WILL HAVE ONE OF THE FOLKS INSIDE THAT\nMEETING WITH DONALD TRUMP I DIDN'T DO.\nREVEREND AL, ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE YOU.\nSEE YOU SUNDAY MORNING.",

MORE THAN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT\nTHE CLINTON FOUNDATION. WHEN IT COMES TO THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION AND THE E-MAILS. ONE WAY TO VIEW YESTERDAY'S\nSPEECH, IT WAS CERTAINLY A CONVERSATION-TURNER.\nTHE CLIP YOU JUST PLAYED I ALSO THOUGHT WAS STRIKING, TOO.\nBECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON WAS MAKING THE ARGUMENT AND\nREPEATING IT AGAIN, THAT DONALD TRUMP IS ISN'T YOUR NORMAL\nREPUBLICAN. THE SPEECH SHE WAS TRYING TO\nGIVE YESTERDAY, THE REPUBLICANS, YOU HAVE A CHOICE, EITHER COME\nVOTE FOR OR YOU CAN END UP SITTING OUT.\nBUT DONALD TRUMP ISN'T THE REPUBLICAN OF JOHN McCAIN.\nHE ISN'T ABOUT A BOB DOLE.

HERE'S WHAT YOU, DONALD TRUMP,\nHAVE SAID OVER THE LAST 14 MONTHS.\n>> SINCE DONALD TRUMP HAS HAD THE LEADERSHIP, WE HAVE SEEN HIM\nMAKE AN APPEAL TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND LATINOS BY\nMAKING AN ARGUMENT ON WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE?\nAND STEPHANIE, AS OTHERS HAVE MENTIONED, THIS NECESSARILY\nISN'T AN APPEAL TO DIRECTLY AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND LATINOS.\nBUT MORE ABOUT A LOT OF THE SUBURBAN WHITES THAT DONALD\nTRUMP IS LOSING IN ALMOST EVERY POLL I HAVE SEEN.\nSO THAT WEEK-LONG APPEAL BY DONALD TRUMP, PLUS WHAT HILLARY\nCLINTON SAID YESTERDAY, YOU COULD END UP SEEING AS A BATTLE\nOVER KIND OF THE SQUISHY MIDDLE ON REPUBLICANS WHO MAYBE ARE\nTHINKING ABOUT VOTING FOR HILLARY CLINTON, OR SUBURBAN\nMOMS WHO ARE UNDECIDED. AND SO I REALLY DO THINK THOSE\nARE TWO AUDIENCES WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT.\n>> SUBURBAN MOMS, NEVER FELT SO POPULAR.\nMARK MURRAY, THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME THIS MORNING.\nWE'RE GOING TO BRING MSNBC'S ENTIRE EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH\nHILLARY CLINTON, WHERE SHE HITS EVERYTHING, WHY SHE THINKS\nDONALD TRUMP IS DISTURBING AND DANGEROUS, WHAT THE FUTURE IS\nFOR THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.

I THINK IT'S STUPID BECAUSE ALL\nTRUMP IS DOING IS E DEMORALIZING HIS BASE.\nTHE PEOPLE WHO HATE HIM STILL HATE HIM, BUT NOW THEY CAN CALL\nHIM A FLIP-FLOPPER. WAY TO GO, WHOEVER TOLD TRUMP TO\nSAY THAT. >> WE'RE JOINED BY A FORMER\nDEPUTY CAMPAIGN MANAGER FOR MARTIN O'MALLEY'S CAMPAIGN.\nANN COULTER IS BROKENHEARTED OVER THE SOFTENING.\nAND SHE'S HOPING THE POSSIBLE HARDENING IS RIGHT AROUND THE\nCORNER. BUT TRUMP TONIGHT WAS TRYING TO\nHAVE IT BOTH WAYS. HE WAS TRYING TO SAY THAT HE\nDIDN'T EVER WANT TO SAY I'M NOT GOING TO DEPORT THOSE PEOPLE,\nBUT HE DIDN'T WANT TO SAY THEY WERE GOING TO STAY AND HE KIND\nOF WRESTLED IT OUT WITH ANDERSON COOPER AND WHERE ARE WE?\n>> IT'S A LOT OF HYPOCRISY AND INSULTS AND JUST STUPIDITY.\nTHAT'S WHAT WE GET FROM DONALD TRUMP ANY TIME HE ROLLS OUT SOME\nSORT OF POLICY. SO IT'S BASICALLY BIGOTED DOUBLE\nSPEAK. SHE'S GOING TO GET HER WAY.\nHE'S NOT GOING TO MOVE AWAY FROM HIS BASE THAT HE'S BEEN REALLY\nFOCUSING ON. SO THERE'S NOTHING NEW HERE.\nHE'S PRETTY MUCH, LIKE I SAID BEFORE, HE'S BAKED IN HIS LATINO\nVOTE AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE. SO WHAT HE'S DOING IS JUST LIKE\nA WINK, A SMILE, HE'S GOING TO DOUBLE DOWN WITH HIS BASE AND\nTHEN HE'S GOING TO TRY AND SOFTEN UP THE SOFTENING IS\nMAKING HIMSELF LOOK BETTER AMONGST THESE WHITE VOTERS.\nTHESE INDEPENDENT, THESE MODERATES, THAT SHOULD BE IN THE\nREPUBLICAN COLUMN, BUT HE'S HEMORRHAGING WITH THEM BECAUSE\nOF THE RACIST THINGS HE SAID IN THE LAST 14 MONTHS.\n>> SO PART OF THE SOFTENING, IT SEEMS, IN TR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN\nMINDS INCLUDES WHAT THEY THINK IS REACHING OUT TO\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS. AND LET'S LISTEN TO ANDERSON\nCOOPER TALKING TO DONALD TRUMP TONIGHT ABOUT THE QUESTION OF IS\nHILLARY CLINTON BIGOTED, WHICH IS THE OTHER WAY DONALD TRUMP\nSEEMS TO BE TRYING TO REACH OUT TO THESE VOTERS.\nLET'S LISTEN TO THIS. >> HOW IS SHE BIGOTED?\n>> SHE'S SELLING THEM DOWN THE TUBES.\nSHE'S NOT DOING ANYTHING FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES.\nSHE TALKS A GOOD GAME. >> SO SHE HAS HATRED?\n>> HER POLICIES ARE BIGOTED BECAUSE SHE KNOWS THEY ARE NOT\nGOING TO WORK. >> YOU'RE SAYING SHE'S\nPERSONALLY BIGOTED. >> OF COURSE, SHE IS.\n>> DO YOU WANT TO TRANSLATE THAT FOR US?\nWHAT WAS THAT? >> I THINK WHAT YOU JUST HEARD\nWAS DONALD TRUMP REALLY TRYING HIS BEST TO AT LEAST KIND OF\nATTACK HILLARY CLINTON IN THE IDEA THE DEMOCRATS HAVE HAD THIS\nHISTORY OF HAVING AFRICAN-AMERICANS OVERWHELMINGLY\nSUPPORT THEM. SOME PEOPLE ARE FRUSTRATED.\nI TALKED TO AFRICAN-AMERICAN DEMOCRATS FRUSTRATED WITH HOW\nWHETHER OR NOT AFRICAN-AMERICAN LIFE HAS GOTTEN BETTER.\nTHE ISSUE IS THAT HE IS TRYING HIS BEST TO KIND OF JUST COME\nBACK AT THIS IDEA THAT HE'S A BIGOT.\nTO DO THAT, HE HAS TO SOME WAY SPIN THAT AND MAKE IT SEEM HIS\nOPPONENT IS A BIGOT. THE PEOPLE HE'S TRYING TO APPEAL\nTO, MAINLY AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND HISPANICS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR,\nTHEY DON'T SEE THIS AS SOMETHING THAT'S AUTHENTIC.\nTHEY THINK THIS IS HIM WINKING AT HIS BASE.\n>> NANCY, HE SEEMS TO BE TAKING A POSITION THAT NO OTHER\nREPUBLICAN HAS EVER TAKEN. AND NO DEMOCRAT HAS EVER TAKEN,\nWHICH IS AFRICAN-AMERICANS' LIVES, ALL OF THEM, ARE\nCOMPLETELY DEPENDENT ON GOVERNMENT ACTION.\nHE TALKS ABOUT TAKING CARE OF YOU.\nAND HE WILL DO THAT. >> IT'S SO INSULTING AND\nDEMEANING AND SUCH BIG, FAT LIE. HE PAINT THIS IS DYSTOPIAN\nVISION OF UNEMPLOYED, BAD SCHOOLS, THERE ARE REAL ISSUES\nTHAT EXIST. DON'T GET ME WRONG.\nTHERE ARE PROBLEMS WITHIN COMMUNITIES AND THERE IS POLICE\nBRUTALITY AND THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF.\nGAPS WITH INCOME, BUT HE INFLATES HIS NUMBERS AND HE\nPAINTS THIS PICTURE THAT NOT ONLY DO I THINK IS KIND OF A\nWINK TO MAYBE A MORE MODERATE THINKING FOLLOWERS THAT THIS IS\nA MAN THAT CARES ABOUT AFRICAN-AMERICANS, BUT I ALSO\nTHINK IT'S A SCARY KIND OF BELL RINGING FOR THE PEOPLE WHO THINK\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE OUT OF CONTROL TRYING TO KILL COPS,\nNEED TO BE SUBDUED. IT WOULD MAKE FRIGHTENED PEOPLE\nWANT TO GET ARMED. IT'S JUST SO UGLY AND SO\nDEMEANING AND YUCK. >> HE HAS A NEW POSITION TONIGHT\nON THE WHITE SUPREMACIST VOTE. THIS CAME OUT IN A LOCAL TV\nINTERVIEW IN NEW HAMPSHIRE TODAY.\nTHIS IS 8 SECONDS. LISTEN CAREFULLY.\n>> I DON'T AT ALL. NOT AT ALL.\nTHIS IS NOT ABOUT HATE. THIS IS ABOUT LOVE.\n>> BREAKING NEWS, HE DOESN'T WANT THE WHITE SUPREMACIST VOTE.\n>> YEAH, OKAY. SO HERE'S THE THING, LAWRENCE.\nDONALD TRUMP WAS SUED FOR HOUSING DISCRIMINATION.\nHE WAS THE SPOKESPERSON FOR THE BIRTHER MOVEMENT, WHICH WAS NOT\nONLY INSULTING TO THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY BUT TO THE FIRST\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT AND IT WAS RACIST.\nALSO AS YOU GUYS WERE SAYING, HE BILLS THIS URBAN BLACK COMMUNITY\nAS A HELL HOLE. THEN HE WENT AFTER A MEXICAN\nJUDGE THINKING THAT, OH, YOU KNOW WHAT, HIS HERITAGE IS GOING\nTO BE BIAS TOWARDS ME. SO IF YOU ASK -- IF YOU TAKE\nDONALD TRUMP'S NAME OFF OF ALL THOSE COMMENTS AND YOU ASK A\nBLACK PERSON, JUST LIKE, HEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THESE\nCOMMENTS, THEY WOULD SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS PERSON IS\nRACIST. THAT'S WHERE WE ARE WITH DONALD\nTRUMP. IT'S THE WORDS THAT HE'S USING.\nIT'S DOCUMENTED. THAT'S WHY HILLARY CLINTON'S\nSPEECH TODAY WAS SO SCATHING BECAUSE ALL SHE HAD HAD TO DO\nWAS, A, GO ON TO BREITBART'S WEBSITE AND LOOK AT THE\nHEADLINES AND THERE YOU HAVE IT. AND LOOK AT DOCUMENTATION OUT\nTHERE OF DONALD TRUMP. >> ALL SHE HAD TO DO WAS USE HIS\nOWN WORDS AND ACTIONS. I CAN'T UNDERSCORE THIS ENOUGH.\nTHIS GUY'S MONEY CAME FROM HOUSING PRACTICES AND HOW HAVING\nA GOOD HOME AND A PLACE TO LIVE. AND HE LIED ABOUT IT WITH THE\nINTERVIEW. HE SAID, NO, IT WAS ALL SETTLED.\nWE DIDN'T HAVE TO PAY. IT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF SCARY TO\nSEE HOW QUICKLY HE COULD TURN THE TRUTH.\n>> ONE OF THE THINGS I REALLY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET AT WHEN\nI TALK TO POLLSTERS, ONE SAID TO ME, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S\nPROBLEMATIC IS NOT JUST THE FACT THAT HE'S REALLY ANGERING\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN, BUT THERE ARE WHITE PEOPLE LISTENING.\nTHEY ARE THE VOTERS, MODERATE REPUBLICANS LISTENING.\nTHAT'S WHERE THE POLLS ARE. THIS IS WHY THE POLLS LOOK THE\nWAY THEY LOOK. BECAUSE THOSE PEOPLE ARE THE\nONES THAT THEIR DECISION IS SAYING WE THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD\nGET BEHIND THIS GUY. WE DIDN'T WANT TO VOTE FOR\nHILLARY CLINTON BECAUSE I HAVE AFRICAN-AMERICAN FRIENDS.\nTHAT'S REALLY WHAT'S HURTING HIM HERE.\nAS MUCH AS HE'S RALLYING HIS BASE, IT'S REALLY HURTING HIM\nNOT JUST FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR. .\nTHIS WHOLE WEEK WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HOW\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS FEEL. SUBURBAN WHITE PEOPLE ARE\nLOOKING AT THIS AND SHAKING THEIR HEAD JUST AS HARD.\n>> A QUICK BREAK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.",

ALSO CALLING THEY1\u00c3\u00b1ALT-RIGHT A\nRACIST IDEOLOGY. BUT REALLY, CHRIS, THIS SPEECH\nWAS AIMED IN SO MANY WAYSjNP AT MODERATE REPUBLICANS IN\nPARTICULAR.

WE HEARD A PREBUTTAL TO THE\nSPEECH AND WE KNEW WHAT WAS COMING.\nDONALD TRUMP TRYING TO TURN HILLARY CLINTON'S ARGUMENT\nAROUND ON HER, RIGHT? >> ABSOLUTELY.\nTRYING TO PREBUT THIS IDEA THAT HILLARY WILL, IF NOT CALL HIM A\nRACIST DIRECTLY, LINK HIM TO WHITE ku)xSUPREMACIST, WHITE\nNATIONALISTS. AS THEY DID IN THAT STRONG AND\nPRETTY FORCEFUL CAMPAIGN AD EARLIER TODAY USING DONALD\nTRUMP'S LACK OF DISEVOW ON@1$ DD                          USING\nSUPREMACISTS, WHITE NATIONALISTS, SUPPORTING DONALD\nTRUMP. MAN IN A KKK COSTUME SAYING HE\nSUPPORTS DONALD TRUMP. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE\nCAMPAIGN DOES NOT WANT OUT THERE.\nTHIS IS A NARRATIVE THEY ARE TRYING TO PUSH BACK FORCEFULLY\nON I CAN TELL YOU THIS IS ONE OF THE QUICKEST RESPONSES WE HAVE\nSEEN FROM THE CAMPAIGN ITSELF WHEN IT COMES TO AN ATTACK\nAGAINST DONALD TRUMP. USUALLY TRUMP WILL GO OUT AND\nTWITTER AND FIGHT BACK OR HE WILL FIGHT BACK HIMSELF AT A\nRALLY BUT THE CAMPAIGN$oR VERY EARLY ON THIS.\nALMOST IMMEDIATELY TRYING TO SPIN THIS MESSAGE.\nTRYING TO SAY IT WAS DISGUTTING THAT HILLARY CLINTON WAS TRYING\nTO PAINT HIM THIS WAY. THEY ARE CLEARLY SENSITIVE TO\nIT. ESPECIALLY AT THE MOMENT THEY\nARE TRYING TO MAKE A MORE FORCEFUL APPEAR TO BLACK AND\nHISPANIC AMERICANS TO GET THEM TO SUPPORT HIM.\nHE IS USING LANGUAGE LIKE WHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO USE TO\nTHOSE COMMUNITIES. STILL, IT IS DONE IN FRONT OF\nMOSTLY WHITE CROWDS LEAVING SOME TO WONDER IF THE REALITY OF DID\nDONALD TRUMP'S MESSAGE IS HE IS TRYING TO APPEAL MORE TOWARDS\u00c3\u0091\nMODERATE GOP WHITE VOTERS. WOMEN SPECIFICALLY.\nAND NOT NECESSARILY MINORITY VOTERS IN THIS COUNTRY TRYING TO\nTURN THEM OUT IN HIGHER NUMBERS BECAUSE HE REALIZES THAT THE\nMINORITY VOTE MIGHT BE JUST TOO HARD TO GET AT THIS POINT.\nRIGHT NOW POLLING, CHRIS, BETWEEN 1 AND 2% AMONG\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS THAT IS A WORST SINCE 1988 EXCEPT FOR\nBARRY GOLD WATER. HE DOESN'T SUPPORT THE CIVIL\nRIGHTS ACT. AND ALSO A LITTLE BIT, NOT QUITE\nAS BAD AS JOHN McCAIN WAS, BUT JOHN McCAIN WAS GOING UP AGAINST\nPRESIDENT OBAMA WHO BECAME THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nPRESIDENT. >> SO YOU HAVE THIS PUSH BACK\nAGAINST THE IDEA THAT CLEARLY HE IS SENSITIVE TO THAT HE IS A\nBIGOT. AND THEN YOU'VE GOT THIS\nPRESSURE COMING AT HIM FROM FELLOW REPUBLICANS TODAY\nINCLUDING SOME WHO HAVE RUN AGAINST HIM IN THE PAST.\nA LOT OF TED CRUZ SUPPORTERS HAVE HAD THINGS TO SAY ABOUT\nWHAT HIS, THEY SAY, SEE AS HIS BACK TRACKING ON IMMIGRATION AND\nJEB BUSH AS WELL.g/xS\u00c3\u00b1 AND RIVALS SAY HE WILL COME PRI\nELECTION. AND REMEMBER DONALD TRUMP WENT\nFORCEFULLY AFTER JEB BUSH AND MARCO RUBIO FOR SUPPORTING3hTAN\nKIND OF IDEA OF AMNESTY FOR BEING PART OF THE GANG OF EIGHT.\nSAYING THAT UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS SHOULD GET SO%@\u00c3\u0091;\nOF ILLEGAL OR LEGAL STATUS IN THIS COUNTRY.\nHAVING HIM SAY THAT TODAY IS MAKING MANY PEOPLE SAY THAT HE\nIS BASICALLY JUST ADOPTED JEB BUSH'S PLAN AND JEB BUSH\nRESPONDED TO THAT FLABBERGASTED AND JUST NOW ON WABC RADIO.\nLISTEN UP. >> HIS VIEWS ARE, THEY SEEM TO\nBE EVER CHANGING DEPENDING ON WHAT CROWD HE IS IN FRONT OF.\nSOUNDS LIKE A TYPICAL POLITICIAN WHERE YOU GET IN FRONT OF ONE\nCROWD AND SAY ONE THING AND SAY SOMETHING ELSE TO ANOTHER CROWD\nTHAT MAY WANT TO HEAR A DIFFERENT VIEW.\nALL THE THINGS THAT DONALD TRUMP RAILED AGAINST HE SEEMS TO BE\nMORPHING INTO. IT IS KIND OF DISTURBING.\n>> THE CAMPAIGN IS NOT CALLING THIS A FLIP-FLOP SAYING HE WILL\nALWAYS UPHOLD0 SAYING HE IS CHANGING HIS\nLANGUAGE BUT THEY ARE \u00c3\u00a1 TO CALL THIS A FLIP-FLOP AND\nREFUSING TO SAY DONALD TRUMP CHANGED HIS POSITION.\nCHRIS? >> KATY TUR, THANK YOU VERY\nMUCH. NOW BRINGING IN FORMER CHAIRMAN\nOF THE RNC AND MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR.\nGUYS, I DON'T REMEMBER A TIME IN MODERN HISTORY WHERE WE HAD THIS\nKIND OF CONVERSATION THAT WE HEARD OVER THE COURSE OF JUST A\nCOUPLE OF HOURS. I MEAN YOU'VE HAD EACH CANDIDATE\nCALLING THE OTHER A BIGOT. OPENLY STATING ARGUMENTS ABOUT\nRAY SIMS, MOTIVATION, TACTICS, HILLARY CLINTON ACCUSING DONALD\nTRUMP OF TAKING HATE GROUPS MAINSTREAM.\nDONALD TRUMP VOICING WHAT A LOT OF REPUBLICANS HAVE FELT FOR A\nLONG TIME. THAT WHEN THERE'S A PROBLEM THAT\nSHOULD BE ANSWERED WITH POLICY. THE DEMOCRAT ANSWER IT WITH\nCHARGES OF RACISM. I WANT IN THE BROADER POLITICS\nAND WHERE WE ARE AS SOCIETY, MICHAEL, I WILL START WITH YOU,\nWHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS? >> I DON'T LIKE IT.\nI THINK IS VERY DISTURBING. IT UNDERMINES A VERY IMPORTANTT\nARGUMENT. WE STILL AS A NATION NEED TO\nHAVE ALL OF THE QUESTIONS OF RACE, RACISM, BIGOTRY, WHICH ARE\nVERY MUCH A PART OF THE AMERICAN FABRIC.\nWE LIKE TO LIVE IN THIS IDEALIC WORLD CHRIS THAT WE SORT OF GOT\nPAST THAT BECAUSE THERE WAS A CIVIL RIGHTS BILL, A VOTING\nRIGHTS BILL. WE ELECTED A BLACK MAN PRESIDENT\nOF THE UNITED STATES. BUT AS WE HAVE SEEN IN RECENT\nYEARS, THE UNDERPINNINGS OF WHAT HAS REALLY KIND OF OPINION\nFERMENTING BENEATH THE SURFACE ARE STILL THERE AND STILL VERY\nMUCH A PART OF THE -- OF WHAT IS GOING ON IN EVERYDAY LIFE.\nSO WHEN YOU START THROWING AROUND THESE TERMSVhQ BIGOT AND\nRACIST, OVER SOMETHING POLITICAL, TO ME IT TAKES YOU\nDOWN A VERY IMPORTANT DISCUSSION THAT WE NEED TO HAVEyz WHEN THE\nIS REAL RACISM AND BIGOTRY THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED.\n>> \u00c3\u00a9DO&U$AN, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THI\u00c3\u0084rlDISCUSSION SOME.\n>> I PATIALLY AGREE WITH MY GOOD/W\u00c3\u00a1\u00c3\u00ad FRIEND, CHAIRMAN STEEL.\nBUT YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP CALLING HILLARY CLINTON A BIGOT\nWITH NO EVIDENCE AND YET HERE WE JUST LISTENED TO HILLARY\nCLINTON'S SPEECH WHERE SHE LAID OUTVt THINGS THAT DONALD TRUMP S\nSAID. PEOPLE INVOLVED IN HIS CAMPAIGN,\nHIS NEW CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN. THE FIGHT HE RAN.\nHEADLINES THAT THEY RAN.@E >> SHE WENT A STEP FURTHER.\nSHE OUTLINED WHAT SHE SAYS IS A HISTORY OF RACIST BEHAVIOR ON\nHIS PART. WENT THROUGH PRACTICES IN\nHOUSING, IN EMPLOYING PEOPLE IN CASINOS, IN THE BIRTHER\nMOVEMENT. MEXICAN IMMIGRATION.\nSHE DID A POINT$@# BY POINT TAK DOWN SAYING THIS PROVES, THIS\nISN'T JUST MY OPINION, THESE ARE THINGS THAT PROVE DONALD TRUMP\nIS A RACIST. >> AND THIS GETS TO THE LARGER\nPOINT OF WHAT I WAS MAKE. THIS IS AMPLIFIES WHAT SHE WAS\nSAYING IN TERMS OF EXPRESSING HER CONCERN ABOUT THE TENOR AND\nTONE OF THE POLITICAL DI<font color=\"#ff00ff\"><u> Qk'M</u></font>\n<font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00c3\u00ac(LC%</font> SINCE ABOUT FEBRUARY.\nREMEMBER, DONALD TRUMP, SINCE JUNE 25, 2015, WHEN HE ANNOUNCED\nHIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, HE HAD DIVISIVE WLAJ LANGUAGE IN\nTHERE. AND THROUGHOUT THE YEAR HILLARY\nCLINTON HAS BEEN MAKING THE SAME ARGUMENTS ABOUT, NOT JUST DONALD\nTRUMP WHERE SHE, AS YOU SAID, OUTLINED AND CONNECTED HIM\nPERSONALLY TO THE DIVISIVE THINGS, BUT ALSO VERY MUCH\nCONCERNED -- I INTERVIEWED HER LAST MONTH, AND SHE IS VERY MUCH\nCONCERNED ABOUT THE TENOR AND TONE OF DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN\nAND WHAT THAT IS DOING TO AMERICAN POLITICS.\nSHE SAID, SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE THOUGHT IT WAS A THREAT TO OUR\nDEMOCRACY AND SHE SAID IT IS FRIGHTENING THAT SOMEONE RUNNING\nFOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WANTS TO SHOW SOME\nDISCORD AND DIVISIVENESS. THIS ISN'T JUST HER TRYING TO\nSCORE POLITICAL POINT ON DONALD TRUMP.\nTHIS IS HER EXPRESSING A REAL CONCERN FOR THE FUTURE OF THE\nCOUNTRY. >> TRUMP RETURNED THE FAVOR,\nSAYING HILLARY CLINTON IS THE BIGOT.\nLET ME PLAY A SOUND. >> IT IS TIME TO GIVE THE\nDEMOCRATS SOME COMPETITION. FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTES AND\nFOR HISPANIC VOTES. HILLARY CLINTON IS A BIGOT.\nWHO VOTES.\nNOT AS HUMAN BEINGS. WORTHY OF A BETTER FUTURE.\n>> BUT WE ALSO KNOW AND IN BRINGING UP THE TELEPROMPTER\nTHERE, MICHAEL, A LOT OF THIS IS DRIVEN BY HIS KPU NEW CAMPAIGN\nSTAFF. A LOT FROM KELLYANNE CONWAY.\nVERY SMART POLSTER. NEW POLL OUT FROM QUINNIPIAC\nTHAT SAYS 59% OF LIKELY VOTERS FEEL THAT THE WAY TRUMP SPEAKS\nPLAYS TO BIGOTRY. HOW DOES THIS ARGUMENT PLAY OUT\nFOR THE ELECTORATE. >> I THINK THAT THAT IS\nSOMETHING THEY NEED TO BE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT.\nTO BE QUITE HONEST ABOUT IT. I THINK IF YOU'VE GOT A\nSIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF AMERICANS, SOME WHO MAY EVEN\nLIKE YOU OR WHO LIKE TO LIKE YOU OR MAYBE EVEN SUPPORT YOU\nFEELING THAT YOU'RE KIND OF PLAYING TO THIS DOG WHISTLE,\nUSING THIS DOG WHISTLE ON RACE, YOU DO HAVE TO CORRECT IT.\nIGch1r THINK IS APPROPRIATE AND OVERDUE TO\u00c3\u0083HAVE THEhrIR CONVERSN\nON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE,t1+ THE PRESIDENTIAL LEVEL, AND\nCONSISTENT WAY ABOUT HOW WE ARE GOING TO WORK WITH AFRICAN\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES AND OTHER COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ON\nBIG ISSUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO THEM.\nBUT IT DOES MATTER HOW YOU SAY IT.\nIT IS VERY IMPORTANT HOW YOU FRAME IT AND YOU HAVE TO DEAL\nWITH PAST RHETORIC, UNFORTUNATELY.\nYOU CAN'T WALK AWAY FROM THAT.21 AND I THINK THOUGH THAT THE\nOTHERkR[ SIDE OF THAT COIN IS TE IS SOME EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT\nWHEN CONVENIENT AND WHEN OPPORTUNE, AND I KNOW THIS\nFIRSTHAND AS HAVING BEEN A CANDIDATE FOR OFFICE, DEMOCRATS\nDO CONVENIENTLY PLAY THIS CARD, WHETHER HILLARY CLINTON GOING\nAND ADOPTING, EFFECTING A SOUTHERN DRAW WHEN TALKING TO\nBLACK FOLKS, PLAYS THE OTHER WAY.\nTHIS GOES BACK IT MY FIRST POINT ABOUT HOW BOTH PARTIES TEND TO\nMANIPULATE THESE QUESTIONS AND ISSUES AROUND RACE IN A WAY THAT\nTHEY THINK IS ADVANTAGEOUS TO THEM IN THE MOMENT.\nI THINK IT UNDERMINES THE SERIOUS ARGUMENT WE NEED TO\nHAVE, OR DISCUSSION WE NEED TO HAVE.\n>> GENTLEMEN, WE'RE OUT OF TIME. IMPORTANT AND PROVOCATIVE\nCONVERSATION. MICHAEL STEELE, JONATHAN\nCAPEHART, THANK YOU BOTH.",

IS THAT TRUE?\nBECAUSE AS WE SIT HERE ON FRIDAY, THERE'S A LOT OF TALK\nABOUT WHAT DONALD TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION POSITION IS.\nTHERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT WHO'S THE BIGOT.\nIF THE DISCUSSION IS ABOUT BIGOTRY AND IMMIGRATION, IS\nDONALD TRUMP WINNING THAT DISCUSSION?\n>> YEAH, JOHN, LOOK, I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.\nIT WAS A LOW BAR FOR DONALD TRUMP TO STAY ON MESSAGE.\nI THINK OVERALL HE'S DONE OKAY IN THAT REGARD.\nI THINK THE PROBLEM IS THERE ARE TWO BIG DE DEFICIENCIES THAT\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS. ONE IS HER UNTRUSTWORTHINESS AND\nTHE OTHER IS THE SOFTENING OF THE ECONOMY.\nINSTEAD OF BEING FOCUSED ON THE ANEMIC GDP GROWTH NUMBERS OR THE\nFACT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION LOOKS AWFULLY SUSPICIOUS, WE'RE\nTALKING ABOUT BIGOTRY AND CHANGING IMMIGRATION POSITIONS.\nTHAT FRAMEWORK IS RIGHT. I THINK DONALD TRUMP NEEDS TO\nNOT JUST STAY ON MESSAGE BUT STAY ON MESSAGE CONSISTENCY, AND\nTHAT'S BEEN THE CHALLENGE TO DATE.\n>> RON BROWNSTEIN, CZAR OF DEMOGRAPHICS, THE DISCUSSIONS\nABOUT IMMIGRATION AND BIGOTRY, THAT'S THE WHAT, BUT WHERE'S THE\nWHY, AND WHO'S THE WHO HERE, WHY ARE THEY SAYING THIS AND WHO ARE\nTHE TARGETED VOTERS? >> THE WHO FOR DONALD TRUMP ARE\nTHESE COLLEGE EDUCATED WHITE VOTERS WHERE HE IS\nUNDERPERFORMING ANY REPUBLICAN NOMINEE EVER, RIGHT.\nI MEAN, NO REPUBLICAN NOMINEE IN THE HISTORY OF POLLING IN 1952\nHAS LOST AMONG COLLEGE EDUCATED WHITES AND TRUMP IS RUNNING EVEN\nAMONG THEM AND AMONG MOST POLLS IS TRAILING.\nTHE QUINNIPIAC POLL WHICH CAME OUT YESTERDAY, I MEAN, TRUMP IS\nFACING A SIGNIFICANT CONSOLIDATION OF WHAT I CALL THE\nCOALITION THE ASCENDANT. THE CORE GROUPS IN THE\nDEMOCRATIC COALITION. ALL OF WHICH WILL BE A BIGGER\nSHARE OF THE ELECTORATE IN 2016 THAN IN 2012.\nMILLENNIALS WHERE HE HAS OVER 70% SAYING HE'S NOT QUALIFIED\nAND SAYING THEY VIEW HIM AS APPEALING TO BIGOTRY.\nTHOSE COLLEGE EDUCATED WHITE WOMEN IN PARTICULAR.\nOVER 60% OF EACH OF THEM SAY HE IS NOT QUALIFIED AND HE IS\nAPPEALING TO BIGOTRY. HE'S ALREADY MOVING BACK SOME OF\nTHE COLLEGE WHITE MEN WHO ARE THE LEAST STABLE PART OF THE\nHILLARY CLINTON COALITION IN THIS QUINNIPIAC POLL BUT THOSE\nOTHER GROUPS REMAIN LOCKED AGAINST HIM WITH IMPRESSIONS\nTHAT HAVE BUILT UP OVER 15 MONTHS AND IT'S A BIG CHALLENGE\nTO UNDO THOSE IMPRESSIONS. >> SHE WARNED DONALD TRUMP ABOUT\nBEING WISHY-WASHY WHEN IT COMPANIYCOMES\nTO HIS IMMIGRATION POSITION. HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE HIS\nMOVEMENT, AT LEAST IN HIS WORDS, ABOUT IMMIGRATION?\n>> I THINK HE'S GOING OUT THERE AND TALKING AND LISTENING TO THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE. WITH DON'T HAVE AN ACTUAL POLICY\nYET. A WRITTEN POLICY SET IN STONE\nTHAT HE HAS PUT OUT THERE. WE KNOW HE'S GOING TO SECURE THE\nBORDER. WE KNOW HE'S GOING TO DEPORT THE\n86,000 CRIMINAL ILLEGAL ALIENS THAT I.C.E. RELEASED AND DIDN'T\nDEPORT THEM. AND WE KNOW HE PUT -- HE'S GOING\nTO PUT AMERICANS FIRST. OTHER THAN THAT, WE DON'T KNOW.\nAND EVERYBODY'S SPECULATING HERE.\nI'M NOT EVEN SURE THAT EVERYBODY IS GOING OFF THE SAME DEFINITION\nOF AMNESTY.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE\nCONVERSATIONS ARE. I DO THINK WE SHOULD WAIT AND\nLET HIM PUT HIS POLICY OUT. I KNOW HE HAS JEFF SESSIONS AND\nSHERIFF JOE, THEY'RE ON BOARD WITH HIM.\nYOU HAVEN'T SEEN THEM BACK PAIWAY.\nI THINK HE'S REACHING OUT TO PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY.\nHE IS A PASSIONATE AND COMPARING PERSON AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT\nWE EXPECT OF OUR LEADERS. >> GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US,\nTHANKS, GUYS.",

AS A POLITICAL POSITION HERE\nWHAT ARE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SUPPORTING HIM ALL ALONG\nWHO FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT IMMIGRATION?\nPARTICULARLY PROMINENT ONES?

BUT SHE CAME OUT ON THIS ISSUE.\nSHE WAS GIVING HIM A WARNING. I WANT TO READ YOU WHAT SHE TOLD\n\"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL.\" IF MR. TRUMP WERE TO GO DOWN A\nPATH WISHY-WASHY POSITIONS TAKEN ON THINGS THAT THE CORE\nFOUNDATION OF HIS SUPPORT HAS SO APPRECIATED, AND THAT IS\nRESPECTING OUR CONSTITUTION AND RESPECTING LAW AND ORDER IN\nAMERICA, THEN, YEAH, THERE WOULD BE MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT.\nSO, YOU KNOW, SHE, AS I SAID, SHE HAS BEEN VERY QUIET.\nWHICH HAS BEEN A MYSTERY IN ITSELF.\nPUTTING THAT ASIDE, THE FACT SHE DESIGNED TO COME OUT AND SAY\nTHIS GIVES YOU A SENSE OF THE FACT THAT THE CORE SUPPORTERS\nFOR WHOM IMMIGRATION IS A VERY BIG ISSUE.\nANYTHING THAT EVEN REMOTELY LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE LETTING PEOPLE\nWHO ARE HERE ILLEGALLY STAY LEGALLY IS AMNESTY, A LITTLE BIT\nOF THAT TERRITORY. >> THAT WAS BEFORE, WE THINK,\nBEFORE DONALD TRUMP TOLD ANDERSON HE DOESN'T THINK THERE\nSHOULD BE A PATH TO LEGALIZATION.\nSO IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE.\nDANA, GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE, THANK YOU SO MUCH.\nTHE IMMIGRATION DEBATE, DISCUSSION, INTERNAL DEBATE\nWITHIN DONALD TRUMP'S OWN HEAD, IS JUST ONE SIDE OF WHAT'S\nFASCINATING ON THE CAMPAIGN NOW. BECAUSE THE CANDIDATES HILLARY\nCLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP ARE DEBATING WHO'S THE BIGOT.\nDONALD TRUMP SAYS HILLARY CLINTON IS A BIGOT.\nHILLARY CLINTON SAYS TRUMP IS MAKING HATE FRINGE GROUPS\nMAINSTREAM. >> FROM THE START, DONALD TRUMP\nHAS BUILT HIS CAMPAIGN ON PREJUDICE AND PARANOIA.\nHE IS TAKING HATE GROUPS MAINSTREAM.\nAND HELPING A RADICAL FRINGE TAKE OVER THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\n>> ALL RIGHT. WANT TO BRING IN CNN'S POLITICAL\nDIRECTOR DAVID CHALIAN RIGHT NOW.\nTHIS IS A REALLY INTERESTING DISCUSSION.\nWE'VE COVERED A LOT OF CAMPAIGNS.\nIT'S NOT EXACTLY ONE I'VE HEARD RIGHT NOW.\nYOU'RE A BIGOT. NO, YOU'RE A BIGOT.\nWHAT'S GOING ON? >> IT'S NOT THE MOST UPLIFTING\nCAMPAIGN MESSAGE. YOU HEARD HILLARY CLINTON WITH A\nDIFFERENT TONE THAN WE NORMALLY HEAR ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\nTHIS WAS NOT A RALLYING CRY AND FIRING UP THE TROOPS.\nSHE WAS TREEING TO TAKE AN EXTREMELY SOBER AND SERIOUS\nAPPROACH TO WHAT SHE BELIEVES IS ANOTHER PIECE OF AN ARGUMENT\nSHE'S PROSECUTING. THAT HE'S UNQUALIFIED FOR THE\nJOB OF PRESIDENT. IN THE PAST, SHE'S TALKED A LOT\nABOUT HIM AND WILL CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT HIS TEMPERAMENT AS\nONE REASON HE'S DISQUALIFIED TO BE COMMANDER IN CHIEF.\nNOW, SHE'S PROSECUTING THE ARGUMENT THAT SAYS HE'S\nEMBRACING THESE IDEAS AND SPEAKING THIS LANGUAGE THAT\nREALLY MAKES HIM ON THE FRINGE OUTSIDE OF THE MAINSTREAM OF\nAMERICAN POLITICS. ANOTHER PIECE OF THIS, JOHN,\nTHAT SHE'S TRYING TO APPEAL TO SOME MODERATE REPUBLICANS IN THE\nMIDDLE WHO ARE TOTALLY RELUCTANT TO DONALD TRUMP AT THIS STAGE OF\nTHE GAME. SHE'S TRYING TO SAY, YOU DON'T\nHAVE TO THINK ABOUT VOTING FOR ME, BUT THIS IS NOT A\nREPRESENTATIVE OF YOUR REPUBLICAN PARTY.\nSHE EVOKES SOME PRETTY BIG NAMES WHEN SHE WAS MAKING THAT POINT.\nLISTEN. >> 20 YEARS AGO, WHENBE\nACCEPTED THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION, HE POINTED TO THE\nEXITS IN THE CONVENTION HALL AND TOLD ANY RACISTS IN THE PARTY TO\nGET OUT. THE WEEK AFTER 9/11, GEORGE W.\nBUSH WENT TO A MOSQUE AND DECLARED FOR EVERYONE TO HEAR\nTHAT MUSLIMS LOVE AMERICA JUST AS MUCH AS I DO.\nIN 2008, JOHN McCAIN TOLD HIS OWN SUPPORTERS THAT THEY WERE\nWRONG ABOUT THE MAN HE WAS TRYING TO DEFEAT.\nSENATOR McCAIN MADE SURE THEY KNEW BARACK OBAMA, HE SAID, IS\nAN AMERICAN CITIZEN AND A DECENT PERSON.\n>> NOW, JOHN, YOU TELL ME, WHEN YOU WERE THINKING THROUGH WHAT\nHILLARY CLINTON MIGHT BE DOING IN THE CLOSING 75 DAYS OF HER\nPRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN AS THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE, DID YOU\nTHINK SHE WOULD EVOKE BOB DOLE AND JOHN McCAIN TO BOLSTER HER\nARGUMENT? >> COMMON LINE OF ARGUMENT\nDATING BACK DECADES -- NO, IT'S VERY, VERY UNUSUAL, VERY\nIMPORTANT TO POINT OUT HOW HILLARY CLINTON IS TRYING TO\nOTHERIZE TRUMP NOW. WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT ALL THIS\nNOW WITH OUR PANEL. MICHAEL NUTT, THE FORMER MAYOR\nOF PHILADELPHIA, HILLARY CLINTON SUPPORTER.\nCNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR AND DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTER KAYLEIGH\nMACANN IS HERE. DOUG HYDE JOIN US.\nCNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR AND HILLARY CLINTON SUPPORTER MARIA\nC CARDONA IS HERE AS WELL.\nKAYLEIGH, MY UNDERSTANDING WHAT DONALD TRUMP TOLD ANDERSON LAST\nNIGHT IS THIS IS HIS CURRENT POSITION ON UNDOCUMENTED\nIMMIGRANTS. HE SEES NO PATH TO LEGALIZATION\nFOR THE 11 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS HERE.\nNO PATH TO LEGALIZATION. HOWEVER, HE WON'T COMMIT TO THE\nFACT THAT THEY ALL SHOULD GO. >> WHAT HE'S SAYING IS THEY HAVE\nTO GO BACK AND RETURN IF THEY WANT ANY CHANCE OF LEGALIZATION.\n>> BUT HE ISN'T COMMITTING TO FORCING THEM TO LEAVE, CORRECT?\n>> HE'S COMMITTING TO REMOVING THE CRIMINALS.\nHE'S STARTING THERE. AFTER THAT, IT'S A NEGOTIATION\nWITH CONGRESS. THAT'S HOW THESE THINGS WORK.\nIT'S A COMPROMISE. >> SO THE CRIMINALS WILL GO.\nTHE NONCRIMINALS, HE'S NOT COMMITTING TO THE FACT THAT THEY\nHAVE TO GO. >> HE'S SAYING -- HIS STARTING\nPOINT IS WITH THE CRIMINALS. WHICH IS WHAT HE'S ALWAYS SAID.\nHERE'S THE THING WITH DONALD TRUMP.\nHIS POSITION IS ONE OF SECURITY. IF WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT\nFLIP-FLOP. LET'S TALK ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON\nWHO WENT LAST NOVEMBER AT A NEW HAMPSHIRE RALLY, SAID AND\nPRAISED THE FACT SHE VOTED FOR A BILL TO PUT A BARRIER ON THE\nBORDER. THAT HAPPENED AT JUST NOVEMBER\nAT A NEW HAMPSHIRE RALLY. 2005, SHE SAID, I AM ADAMANTLY\nAGAINST ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT HILLARY\nCLINTON WHO AT ONE POINT WAS FOR SECURING THE BORDER BUT NOW IS\nFOR -- >> I DON'T THINK SHE BACKTRACKED\nWHERE SHE SUPPORTED PUTTING IT UP.\nDOUG HYDE, THE POINT I WAS MAKING WITH KAYLEIGH, AND YOU'VE\nBEEN PART OF THE IMMIGRATION BATTLES FOR A LONG TIME.\nIS IT A THING? CAN YOU ALLOW FOR THE\nUNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS WHO ARE HERE WHO HAVEN'T COMMITTED A\nCRIME, CAN THEY STAY WITHOUT LEGALIZATION?\nWHAT'S THAT? ISN'T THAT JUST A STATUS QUO?\n>> I THINK IT'S A STATUS QUO. PROBABLY SOME FORM OF PURGATORY\nAS WELL. ONE OF THE THINGS HOUSE\nREPUBLICANS TRIED TO AADDRESS WHEN I WAS WORKING IN THE HOUSE\nOF REPRESENTATIVES. WE TRIED TO SOLICIT IDEAS.\nWHAT WE WERE TOLD IS ANYTHING SHORT OF A FULL DEPORTATION WAS\nAMNESTY. SO BY THAT DEFINITION, BY TRUMP\nSUPPORTERS NOW, IS AMNESTY. WHAT WE'VE ALSO SEEN, IT SOUNDS\nLIKE DONALD TRUMP IS NOT JUST EMBRACING THE JEB BUSH POSITION\nBUT ALSO MITT ROMNEY'S POSITION. >> HE NO LONGER SAYS THERE\nSHOULD BE A PATH TOSEEMED TO SU FEW DAYS.\nHOWEVER, HE DIDN'T COMMIT TO THE FACT THEY SHOULD LEAVE.\nMARIA, WANT TO GIVE YOU SOME CREDIT HERE.\nBECAUSE YOU SAID YESTERDAY ON THIS SHOW, YOU SAID YOU DID NOT\nTHINK, YOU DID NOT BELIEVE DONALD TRUMP WHEN HE WAS\nTHINKING MAYBE HE THOUGHT THERE SHOULD BE SOME LEGAL STATUS.\n>> EXACTLY. HE DID EXACTLY WHAT I KNEW HE\nWAS GOING TO DO. I LOVE THE WAY YOU GUYS PUT IT.\nHE BACKTRACKED ON HIS FLIP-FLOP. BECAUSE THIS IS A MAN WHO HAS --\nNOT ONLY DOES HE HAVE NO IDEA WHERE HE STANDS ON THIS AND HE\nJUST KIND OF PUTS HIS FINGER UP IN THE WIND TO FIGURE OUT WHAT\nHIS SUPPORTERS WANT. HE READ THEM VERY WELL IN THE\nREPUBLICAN PRIMARIES WHEN HE FOCUSED ON THE DRACONIAN\nPOSITION OF DEPORTING THEM ALL AND PUTTING UP A WALL AND\nPUTTING A DEPORTATION FORCE IN ORDER TO DO IT.\nAND HE GOT THE MAJORITY OF HIS VOTES DURING THOSE PRIMARIES\nFROM PEOPLE WHO LOVED THAT POSITION.\nBUT NOW I THINK HE IS IN A PICKLE.\nBECAUSE HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO MOVE FORWARD TO TRY TO ATTRACT\nOTHER MODERATES. FORGET THE HISPANIC VOTE.\nI THINK THAT HE KNOWS THAT IS DEAD IN THE WATER FOR HIM.\nAND FOR THE REASONS THAT I HAVE SPOKEN IN ABUNDANCE OF ON THIS\nPROGRAM AND OTHERS. THERE'S NO TRUST THERE.\nTHEY DON'T SEE HIM AS SOMEBODY WHO UNDERSTANDS THE HISPANIC\nVOTE. WHO EVEN CARES ABOUT WHAT WE\nWANT. AND SO THIS IS HIS OPPORTUNITY,\nAT LEAST IN HIS MIND, TO TRY TO GET MORE MODERATE REPUBLICANS TO\nNOT THINK OF HIM AS SUCH A RACIST AND SUCH A BIGOT.\nONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECES OF INFORMATION IN ALL THE POLLS\nTHAT HAVE COME OUT IS MORE THAN TWO-THIRDS OF AMERICANS OVERALL\nBELIEVE THAT HE HOLDINGS RACIST VIEWS AND THAT HE HOLDS BIGOTED\nVIEWS. AND THAT'S WHAT HE'S TRYING TO\nCHANGE. >> YOU JUST DROPPED THE \"R\" WORD\nAND THE \"B\" WORD, WHICH IS A GOOD SEGUE TO THE OTHER PART OF\nWAYS GOING ON OUT THERE NOW. WHICH IS THAT HILLARY CLINTON\nMAY OR MAY NOT HAVE GIVEN A SPEECH WHERE SHE ACCUSED DONALD\nTRUMP OF ASSOCIATING WITH RACISTS.\nTHIS IS UNUSUAL, MAYOR, IN A CAMPAIGN SEASON.\nWHY ARE WE SEEING THIS? >> WELL, I MEAN, I SAID EARLIER,\nIT REALLY GOES BACK TO AS SECRETARY CLINTON LAID OUT\nYESTERDAY IN VERY MEASURED REMARKS THAT WERE PRESIDENTIAL\nIN STATURE. SHE LAID OUT THE CASE FOR HOW\nTHIS GOT STARTED. IT STARTED WITH THE BAN ON\nMUSLIMS. STARTED WITH INSULTING THE\nMEXICAN COMMUNITY. STARTED WITH INSUBTLING THE\nPHYSICALLY DISABLED INDIVIDUALS. IT STARTS THE CONCEPT OF DONALD\nTRUMP IS TO INSULT AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE, SAY ANYTHING\nYOU WANT AND CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT OF FOSTERING THIS\nHATE. THE SECRETARY DIDN'T ACUSE HIM\nOF ASSOCIATING WITH THESE PEOPLE.\nIT'S A FACT HE ASSOCIATES WITH THEM OR ENCOURAGES THEIR\nSUPPORT. DOES NOT DENOUNCE PEOPLE LIKE\nDAVID DUKE AND OTHERS. BRINGS ON BANNON.\nTHESE ARE FACTS. HE CAN'T ESCAPE THESE THINGS --\n>> WE HAVE A LOT OF FACTS ON OUR END, MAYOR NUTTER.\n>> KAYLEIGH, LET ME FINISH -- >> -- YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT\nASSOCIATE, WELL, WHY DID CLINTON GO TO HIS WEDDING IF HE WAS SUCH\nA BAD GUY. ANSWER THAT QUESTION.\n>> YOU HAVE TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT THAT.\nI DON'T CONTROL HIS SCHEDULE AND WHO GOES TO WHAT WEDDINGS.\n>> I'M TALKING ABOUT HER SCHEDULE, SHE WENT TO HIS\nWEDDING -- >> WHAT I'M SAYING -- KAYLEIGH,\nCUT IT OUT. WHAT I'M SAYING HERE IS HE HAS\nCREATED AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE ALL OF THIS HATE AND CONTROVERSY\nGETS CREATED, HE'S TANGLED HIMSELF UP IN IT.\nAND HE HAS NO PATHWAY OUT. THE REASON YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND\nHIS IMMIGRATION POSITION IS BECAUSE HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HIS\nIMMIGRATION POSITION IS FROM TIME TO TIME UNTIL HE GETS\nADVICE FROM SOMEONE ELSE. >> CAN I JUST QUICKLY SAY, I'M\nBEFUDDLED AT YOU TELLING TRUMP SUPPORTERS TO CUT IT OUT.\nYOUR CANDIDATE PUT UP AN AD COMPARING HIM AND ALLYING HIM\nWITH THE KKK WHEN WE CAN DO THE SAME THING TO YOU.\nWE CAN TALK ABOUT ROBERT BYRD, A KKK GRAND DRAGGEN WHO HILLARY\nCLINTON EMBRACED -- >> YOU MEAN LATER A GREAT CIVIL\nRIGHTS CHAMPION -- >> -- WE CAN TALK ABOUT BILL\nCLINTON LEAVING THE CONFEDERATE STAR ON THE ARKANSAS FLAG.\nWE CAN TALK ABOUT BILL CLINTON GOING TO AN ALL-WHITE GOLF\nCOURSE. WE CAN TALK ABOUT ALL THOSE\nFACTS. BUT YOU GUYS DO NOT WANT TO TALK\nABOUT THEM -- >> LOVE TALKING ABOUT FACTS --\n>> DOUG, I WAS TALKING -- >> UNUSUAL DAY.\n>> IT'S AN UNUSUAL CAMPAIGN WHERE THE AUGRGUMENT IS WHO IS E\nBIGGER BIGOT. SINCE HILLARY CLINTON GAVE THIS\nSPEECH THAT I'VE HEARD PAUL RYAN STAND UP AND SAY, YOU KNOW, NO,\nDONALD TRUMP'S NOT A BIGOT. I HAVEN'T HEARD MANY SENIOR\nREPUBLICANS DEFEND DONALD TRUMP FROM WHAT WAS A PRETTY SCATHING\nSPEECH. WHY?\n>> I THINK WHAT YOU'VE SEEN, AND CNN REPORTED ON THIS EARLIER,\nYOU LOOK AT A LOT OF THE SENATE RACES AND HOUSE RACES.\nTHEY'RE FIGHTING FOR THEMSELVESES RIGHT NOW.\nDONALD TRUMP IS A MASSIVE DISTRACTION THAT EVERY\nREPUBLICAN CANDIDATE HAS TO DEAL WITH.\nI CAN TELL YOU, JOHN, MY FIRST CAMPAIGN WAS FOR JESSE HELMS.\nI WORKED FOR MICHAEL STEELE. THAT'S A LOT OF DIVERSE CAST OF\nCHARACTERS. THERE'S BEEN ONE CONSISTENT\nTHREAD. THIS IS SOMETHING DONALD TRUMP\nSAID WAS TRUE. THE CALL OF RACISM IS A\nCORNERSTONE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PLAYBOOK.\nI'VE SEEN PEOPLE'S RACE USED AGAINST THEM.\nWHETHER THEY'RE JEWISH REPUBLICANS OR AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nREPUBLICANS. THE CHALLENGE IS FOR A LOT OF\nREPUBLICANS THE RHETORIC THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS USED OVER THE\nPAST YEAR, THE COMMENTS ON MUSLIM S, ON THE KHAN FAMILY AND\nON AND ON. IT'S WHY I CAME OUT AGAINST\nDONALD TRUMP IN JANUARY AND SO MANY OTHER REPUBLICANS ARE\nHESITANT TO NOT ONLY DEFEND HIM BUT EVEN VOTE FOR HIM.\n>> ALL RIGHT, DOUG, MAYOR NUTTER --\n>> -- AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND THOSE REMARKS --\n>> A LOT MORE TO DISCUSS COMING UP.\nWE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION POSITION, IF\nPARTS OF IT SOUND FAMILIAR, IT'S BECAUSE YOU HEARD SIMILAR\nPROPOSALS FROM PEOPLE, LIKE, SAY, THAT GUY, JEB BUSH WHO\nLOST. SO WHAT DOES JEB BUSH HAVE TO\nSAY ABOUT ALL THIS? THAT'S COMING UP.\nPLUS, A FEDERAL JUDGE SETTINGS A DEADLINE FOR THE STATE\nDEPARTMENT TO START RELEASING HILLARY CLINTON'S PRIVATE SERVER\nE-MAILS UNCOVERED BY THE FBI. WE HAVE DETAILS AHEAD.\nPLUS, A SITTING GOVERNOR LEAVES QUITE A VOICE MAIL FOR A RIVAL\nLAWMAKER. THIS ONE IS A DOOZY.\n>> I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT MY\nBEING A RACIST, YOU [ BLEEP ], AND I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.\nYOU WANT, I WANT YOU TO PROVE I'M A RACIST.\nI'VE SPENT MY LIFE HELPING BLACK PEOPLE AND YOU LITTLE SON OF A\n[ BLEEP ] SOCIALIST [ BLEEP ]",

WHO NEW.\nI KNOW IT FRUSTRATES TO HEAR ME. I'M SORRY.\nWHO KNEW THAT IT WOULD BE DONALD TRUMP TO COME AND CONVERT THE\nGOP BASE TO SUPPORTING AMNESTY. >> WITH ME NOW, REPUBLICAN\nSTRATEGIST, JUSTIN SAFETY, A CAMPAIGN SURROGATE FOR JEB\nBUSH'S CAMPAIGN, AND ALSO, SERVED AS COMMUNICATIONS DIREC\nFOR JEB BUSH WHILE HE WAS GOVERNOR.\nNICE TO HAVE YOU WITH US THIS MORNING.\nA LOT TO TALK ABOUT HERE THIS MORNING.\nWE HEARD OF COURSE FROM JEB BUSH.\nDONALD TRUMP SPOKE WITH OUR OWN ANDERSON COOPER LAST NIGHT, AND\nBASICALLY WAS BACK TO THE POSITION HE HAD IN THE PRIMARIES\nAFTER THAT INTERVIEW. AS SOMEONE WHO HAS SPENT TIME IN\nCAMPAIGNS, AS SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN BEHIND THE SCENES WITH\nCANDIDATES, BOTH WHEN THEY'RE IN SEARCH OF, YOU KNOW, VYING FOR\nOFFICE AND IN OFFICE, HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THESE MESSAGES TO\nVOTERS, ESPECIALLY 70-SOME ODD DAYS FROM THE ELECTION.\n>> I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG CONCERNS FOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.\nHE WAS VERY CLEAR, VERY EMPHATIC DURING THE PRIMARY CAMPAIGN WHEN\nHE WAS TRYING TO WIN THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION ABOUT HIS\nPOSITION ON IMMIGRATION. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT A LOT OF\nREPUBLICAN VOTERS GRAVITATED TOWARD WAS DONALD TRUMP, THEY\nFELT, WAS SOMEONE WHO SAID WHAT HE THOUGHT AND WOULDN'T BACK\nDOWN. WOULD STAND FIRM.\nNOW ALL OF A SUDDEN, WE'RE SEEING THAT HE MAY BE CHANGING\nHIS POSITION ON IMMIGRATION ISSUE, ONE OF THE MOST EMOTIONAL\nISSUES IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY, AND FOR OUR COUNTRY.\nSO I THINK THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN APPARENTLY, TRUMP IS GOING TO\nGIVE A SPEECH NEXT WEEK IN PHOENIX ON IMMIGRATION, BUT\nTHAT'S THE RISK THAT HE IS RUNNING, IS HURTING HIS OWN\nBRAND THAT HE DEVELOPED DURING THE CAMPAIGN.\nNOW, AS A REPUBLICAN, I SUPPORT JEB BUSH, MARCO RUBIO POSITION\nON IMMIGRATION. SO FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE, I\nTHINK IF HE DOES CHANGE HIS POLICY, HE IS COMING MORE TO\nWHERE MOST AMERICANS ARE AND TO THE REASONABLE REALISTIC\nPOSITION. BUT IN TERMS OF HIS BRAND OF\nSAYING WHAT HE MEANS AND NOT BACKING DOWN, HE IS GOT A HUGE\nRISK THERE. >> CAN HE COME OUT AND SAY,\nTHOUGH, AS WE HEARD EARLIER FROM SCOTTIE NELL HUGHES, THIS IS A\nRESULT OF SPEAKING WITH REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS, SPEAKING\nWITH FOLKS IN WASHINGTON WHO HAVE GIVEN HIM A BETTER SENSE OF\nHOW THINGS CAN WORK AT THIS POINT, WHAT YOU ACTUALLY CAN DO,\nWITH EXISTING LAWS. WOULD DONALD TRUMP BE BETTER\nSERVED TO SAY YEAH, I DID, I'VE TALKED TO A LOT OF PEOPLE, I'M\nEVOLVING MY POSITION, BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT I'VE LEARNED, COME\nOUT IN THE IMMIGRATION SPEECH AND SAY THIS IS ALL YOU'LL HEAR\nFROM ME? >> I THINK WOULD WELCOME THAT\nFOR ONE AS A REPUBLICAN, I WOULD WELCOME THAT.\nIT WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE TAKE A\nREASONABLE AND REALISTIC POSITION THAT WAS ADVOCATED BY\nJEB BUSH AND MARCO RUBIO AND OTHERS DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL\nPRIMARY, AND IF HE SAYS, LISTEN, I'VE CHANGED MY VIEW OR ALTERED\nMY VIEW OR MODIFIED MY POSITION, BASED ON THE PEOPLE I'VE SPOKEN\nTO ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, I THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY FINE.\nBUT AT THE SAME TIME, THERE ARE A GROUP OF PEOPLE, AND WE HEARD\nTHAT CLIP FROM RUSH LIMBAUGH AND OTHERS IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY\nTHAT ARE GOING TO BE DISMAYED TO HEAR HIM CHANGE HIS POSITION,\nAND THAT'S THE PART THAT HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO WORK ON.\n>> AS WE KNOW, HE IS WORKING ON GETTING CERTAIN VOTES, AND SO IS\nHILLARY CLINTON OF COURSE. THERE HAS BEEN A LOT MADE OF\nREPUBLICANS THAT WILL SUPPORT HILLARY CLINTON.\nHER MESSAGE WAS VERY CLEAR, AND REALLY STOOD OUT.\nI WANT TO PLAY OUT WHAT SHE HAD TO SAEID.\n>> THE PARTY OF LINCOLN HAS BECOME THE PARTY OF TRUMP.\nTHE WEEK AFTER 9/11, GEORGE W. BUSH WENT TO A MOSQUE AND\nDECLARED FOR EVERYONE TO HEAR THAT MUSLIMS LOVE AMERICA JUST\nAS MUCH AS I DO. IN 2008, JOHN McCAIN TOLD HIS\nOWN SUPPORTERS THAT THEY WERE WRONG ABOUT THE MAN HE WAS\nTRYING TO DEFEAT. SENATOR McCAIN MADE SURE THEY\nKNEW BARACK OBAMA, HE SAID, IS AN AMERICAN CITIZEN AND A DECENT\nPERSON. WE NEED THAT KIND OF LEADERSHIP\nAGAIN. >> SO HILLARY CLINTON CLEARLY\nMAKING A PUSH THERE FOR REPUBLICAN VOTERS, SORT OF A\nTWO-PART QUESTION. IS THAT AN EFFECTIVE MESSAGE FOR\nREPUBLICANS WHO DON'T FEEL THEY HAVE A PLACE TO TURN, AND NUMBER\nTWO, ARE MOST REPUBLICANS ACTUALLY LISTENING TO WHAT\nHILLARY CLINTON IS SAYING? ARE THEY INTERESTED IN MAKING\nTHE MOVE OVER TO SUPPORTING HILLARY CLINTON?\n>> WELL, I THINK THAT HILLARY CLINTON SPEECH, TRASHING AND\nBASHING DONALD TRUMP WAS A GREAT CAMPAIGN STRATEGY TO DISTRACT\nFROM THE AP REPORT EARLIER THIS WEEK THAT BASICALLY INDICATED OR\nIMPLIED THAT SHE WAS PUTTING A FOR SALE SIGN ON THE SECRETARY\nOF STATE'S OFFICE, BY MEETING WITH PEOPLE WHO HAD GIVEN\nMILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nSO YOU KNOW, KUDOS TO THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN FOR THE ART OF\nDISTRACTION AND THE ART OF CHANGING THE TOPIC.\nHAVING SAID THAT, I THINK THAT, SURE, SHE'LL TRY TO GET\nREPUBLICAN VOTES, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, NONE OF THE PEOPLE\nTHAT SHE CITED WHEN SHE MENTIONED THE REPUBLICANS, NONE\nOF THEM ARE BACKING HILLARY CLINTON FOR PRESIDENT.\nMOST -- THE PARTY OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, THE PARTY OF\nLINCOLN, IS STILL THE PARTY OF LINCOLN.\nIT IS NOT THE PARTY OF ONE PERSON.\nIT IS THE PARTY OF JOHN McCAIN, THE PARTY OF JEB BUSH, A NUMBER\nOF OTHER REPUBLICANS. SO WE HAVE A BROAD AND DIVERSE\nREPUBLICAN COALITION FROM THIS COUNTRY, AND I THINK THAT THE\nHILLARY CLINTON'S ISSUES WITH THE E-MAIL, PUTTING OUR NATIONAL\nSECURITY AT RISK, THOSE TYPES OF ISSUES WILL ULTIMATELY KEEP HER\nFROM GETTING A LOT OF REPUBLICAN VOTES.\n>> JUST A REAL QUICK QUESTION FOR YOU, YOU SAY IT IS THE PARTY\nOF LINCOLN, THE PARTY OF JEB BUSH, IS IT THE PARTY OF DONALD\nTRUMP? >> DONALD TRUMP IS A REPUBLICAN\nRIGHT NOW. AND HE IS PART OF THE REPUBLICAN\nPARTY. BUT I ABSOLUTELY DISAGREE THAT\nTHE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE PARTY OF DONALD TRUMP.\nWE HAVE A NUMBER OF REPUBLICANS RUNNING ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY\nFROM CALIFORNIA TO NEW HAMPSHIRE TO IOWA TO FLORIDA, AND ALL IN\nBETWEEN. WE ARE A HUGE, LARGE DIVERSE\nPARTY. WE ARE A MAJOR PARTY.\nRIGHT NOW, I THINK THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO FOCUS ON, BECAUSE WE ARE\nA VERY, VERY DIVERSE PARTY. I'M SPEAKING TO YOU FROM MIAMI.\nWE HAVE A NUMBER OF GREAT REPUBLICANS HERE IN MIAMI.\nIT IS OUR PARTY, TOO. >> JUSTIN SAYFIE, APPRECIATE\nYOUR TIME THIS MORNING.",

THIS IS A YEAR WHERE THERE IS SO\nMUCH TO DISCUSS IN TERMS OF ISSUES, AND YET BOTH CAMPAIGNS\nSEEM TO BE FOCUSED ON HURLING INSULTS AT ONE EACH OTHER.\nQUESTION TO BOTH OF YOU, LADIES FIRST.\nHOW DID WE GET TO THIS POINT? >> NO, I AGREE WITH YOU.\nTHAT'S VERY SAD. WE GOT TO THIS POINT BECAUSE WE\nHAVE A PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY AND WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO HEAL\nTHE WOUND, BOTH WITHIN THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY,\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, AND AS AMERICANS AS A WHOLE.\nWE'RE TRYING TO FIND A SOLUTION. I DON'T THINK IT IS WORKINGMENT\nUNFORTUNATELY, AS I LISTENED TO HILLARY CLINTON'S SPEECH\nYESTERDAY, WE'VE COME TO DECIDE THAT I HAVE THE RIGHT TO CAUSE\nHATRED UPON YOU, TO SIT THERE AND CALL YOU NAMES BECAUSE I\nFEEL THAT'S JUST IDENTIFY BECAUSE OF WHAT HAS COME ACROSS\nTO ME. HILLARY CLINTON, YESTERDAY, DID\nNOT ONLY JUST TALK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, SHE TALKED ABOUT AN\nENTIRE GROUP OF PEOPLE. 14 MILLION VOTERS TO BE\nSPECIFIC, THAT HAS GROWN SINCE DONALD TRUMP SECURED THE\nNOMINATION. SHE INSULTED EVERY SINGLE ONE OF\nUS, CALLING US ALL NAMES. WHILE MR. TRUMP'S SPEECHES ARE\nPOSITIVE AND HE IS TRYING TO REACH OUT TO THE\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY. TRYING TO REACH OUT TO HISPANICS\nAND BRING THEM IN, AND INCLUDE THEM AND SHE IS TRYING TO\nDEMONIZE A LARGE GROUP OF AMERICANS.\n>> IF YOU LOOK BACK AT THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION, IT WAS\nFAR FROM A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE. I SAT THERE EVERY SINGLE DAY.\nI WAS THERE IN CLEVELAND. IT WAS NOT ALL ROSES AND\nFLOWERS, AND NOT ABOUT LOVE, AS DONALD TRUMP HAS TAKEN TO SAYING\nIN THE LAST 24 HOURS. IT WAS ABOUT FEAR, AND THE\nTERRIBLE STATE OF THIS COUNTRY. I JUST WANT TO GO BACK TO THE\nQUESTION. IT IS MORE ABOUT, THIS IS\nRHETORIC COMING FROM BOTH SIDES. THIS IS NOT JUST ONE CANDIDATE\nHURLING INSULTS AT THE OTHER. MICHAEL, I PUT THIS AGAIN TO\nYOU. WHERE ARE THE ISSUES IN THE\nCAMPAIGN? IT HAS BECOME YOU SHOULD VOTE\nFOR ME BECAUSE I'M NOT THE OTHER PERSON, WHO IS REALLY, REALLY,\nREALLY, TERRIBLE. IT IS NOT BECAUSE I'VE GOT THE\nBEST PLAN ON EITHER SIDE. >> WELL, IT CERTAINLY STARTED\nOUT THAT WAY FOR SECRETARY CLINTON.\nSHE IS, I MEAN, YOU CAN SAY A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT HER, BUT SHE\nIS A POLICY WONK AND HAS MORE IDEAS AND PLANS THAN, YOU KNOW,\nJUST ABOUT ANYBODY ELSE OUT THERE.\nTHAT'S THE KIND OF CAMPAIGN SHE RAN DURING THE COURSE OF THE\nPRIMARY. CERTAINLY INTO NOW THE GENERAL\nELECTION. ON THE OTHER HAND, WHAT SHE WAS\nPOINTING OUT YESTERDAY IS FROM THE START, DONALD TRUMP WAS FOR\nBANNING MUSLIMS FROM THE UNITED STATES, INNIN -- INSULTING\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS, THESE ARE THE PILLARS, THE FUNDAMENTAL\nTENANTS, THE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN AND DISPATCH WITH 16 OTHER\nCANDIDATE, MANY OF WHOM HAVE HAD LONG PUBLIC SERVICE CAREERS AND\nHAVE DONE SOME STUFF. SO AGAIN, IN THIS BUSINESS, IF\nSOMEONE TAKES THESE KIND OF SLEDGEHAMMER SWIPES AT YOU,\nYOU'RE NOT GOING TO STAND BY AND JUST TAKE A BEATING.\n>> DO YOU MAKE IT YOUR FOCUS? >> DONALD TRUMP, DEBATE AND\nDISCUSSION, HILLARY CLINTON WILL MEET HIM ANY TIME, ANY PLACE,\nANY WHERE THAT HE WANTS TO HAVE SERIOUS DISCUSSION.\nSHE IS NOT GOING TO ALLOW HERSELF TO BE PUNCHED AND NOT\nRESPOND. >> WHICH WE GET, RIGHT.\nI THINK ANYBODY WHO HAS INSULTED YOU AUTOMATICALLY WANTS TO\nRESPOND. BUT DO YOU MAKE THAT --\n>> IT IS BEYOND, INSULT. >> DO YOU MOVE ON AND TAKE THE\nHIGH ROAD? >> I DON'T MEAN TO CUT ACROSS\nYOU. I APOLOGIZE.\nIT IS NOT JUST THAT THERE ARE INSULTS.\nTHIS IS A NATIONAL CAMPAIGN THAT OF COURSE HAS INTERNATIONAL\nRAMIFICATIONS. SO THE IDEAS THAT IN THE\nSTATEMENTS, THE FEW WORDS AT A TIME THAT COME OUT OF DONALD\nTRUMP'S MOUTH ARE ALSO ISSUES ABOUT THE PHILOSOPHY AND THE\nVIEW AND THE VISION OF THE CURRENT AMERICA AND WE'RE TRYING\nTO GO IN THE FUTURE. APART OF BEING A CANDIDATE,\nLOCAL, STATE, FEDERAL, AND CERTAINLY FOR PRESIDENT OF THE\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, YOU ARE REALLY SPEAKING TO THE\nWORLD. THE REST OF THE WORLD IS TRYING\nTO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE UNITED STATES, AND THEY\nARE FEARFUL OF A DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENCY, AND SO YOU KNOW,\nERICA, AS WELL AS I DO, WHEN A CANDIDATE LIKE HILLARY CLINTON\nSPEAKS, SHE IS NOT ONLY TALKING TO YOU ALL DIRECTLY, SHE IS\nTALKING TO OTHER AMERICANS, BUT ALSO SENDING MESSAGES AROUND THE\nWORLD ABOUT WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE ARE NOT, WHICH IS NOT THE\nPARTY OF DONALD TRUMP, AND THE HATE AND VICIOUSNESS THAT COMES\nOUT OF THE CAMPAIGN. >> BAD NEWS IS THAT WE'RE OUT OF\nTIME. THE GOOD NEWS, WE'RE NOT OUT OF\nTIME WHEN IT COMES TO THE ELECTION.\nSO WE HAVE GOT 70-SOME ODD MORE DAYS TO CONTINUE TALKING ABOUT\nTHIS. MICHAEL NUTTER, SDCOTTIE NELL\nHUGHES, THANK YOU.",

DONALD TRUMP HAS AN ANSWER FOR\nPEOPLE LIKE YOU. HE SAYS YOU ARE THE\nESTABLISHMENT. YOU ARE WHAT THE GOP THAT MADE\nIT LOSERS, AND HE IS THE NEW WAVE OF THE PARTY AND THAT'S WHY\nHE GOT THE MOST VOTES, AND YOU NEED TO GET ON BOARD WITH WHAT\nTHE PARTY IS TODAY. DO YOU ACCEPT THAT?\n>> NOT AT ALL. I THINK THAT DONALD TRUMP'S\nBETRAYING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. BETRAYING OUR PRINCIPLES.\nYOU KNOW, JUST NOW, WITH ALL THIS TALK ABOUT RACISM, I MEAN,\nYOU KNOW, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WAS FOUNDED UNDER ABRAHAM\nLINCOLN. WE WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE\nCIVIL RIGHTS BILL IN 1964, AND I PROUDLY SERVED WITH THE\nPRESIDENT WHO GOT 11% OF THE BLACK VOTE, 44% OF THE HISPANIC\nVOTE. NO, THINGS HAVE TAKEN A VERY,\nVERY BAD TURN. LET ME JUST SAY THAT IT IS NOT\nJUST MEMBERS OF THE SO-CALLED ESTABLISHMENT WHO ARE SAYING\nTHAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nABOUT 5 MILLION PEOPLE BASED ON THE QUINNIPIAC POLL, 5 MILLION\nREPUBLICANS ARE NOW SAYING THEY'RE VOTING FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON. SO THERE ARE LOTS OF PEOPLE,\nNORMAL REPUBLICANS, WHO CAN'T STOMACH DONALD TRUMP, AND WANT\nTO VOTE FOR MRS. CLINTON AS A WAY TO DEFEAT HIM.\n>> NOW, THERE IS ANOTHER ANGLE OF PUSH BACK WHICH IS OKAY, YOU\nDON'T LIKE DONALD TRUMP AS A TRADITIONAL REPUBLICAN, I GET\nIT, BUT THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS SO UNACCEPTABLE TO TRADITIONAL\nREPUBLICANS THAT THEY COULD NEVER VOTE FOR HER.\nSO NOT ONLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS UNUSUAL TO HEAR, BUT DONALD\nTRUMP UPSETS YOU AS A REPUBLICAN, BUT YOU'RE GOING TO\nVOTE FOR CLINTON. WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT AS\nOPPOSED TO SAYING I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE I'LL GO THIRD PARTY, MAYBE\nI'LL WRITE SOMEBODY IN, WHICH WE'VE HEARD FROM OTHERS.\n>> RIGHT. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT\nQUESTION. THERE ARE LOTS AND LOTS OF\nPEOPLE LIKE ME THAT QUINNIPIAC POLL THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT\nSAYS THAT ROUGHLY ONE QUARTER OF REPUBLICANS SAY THAT THEY\nDISAPPROVE OF DONALD TRUMP. BUT MANY OF THEM ARE ON THE\nFENCE. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.\nNOW, IT IS MY BELIEF THAT VOTING FOR HILLARY CLINTON IS\nIMPORTANT, BECAUSE IT WILL ACTUALLY DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP.\nAND I AGREE WITH THE 50 FOREIGN POLICY EXPERTS, PEOPLE LIKE TWO\nHOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARIES, TWO DEPUTY SECRETARIES OF\nDEFENSE THAT SAY THAT DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT HAVE THE\nCHARACTER, THE VALUES OR THE EXPERIENCE TO BE PRESIDENT OF\nTHE UNITED STATES. AND WHILE I DON'T AGREE WITH\nHILLARY CLINTON ON EVERYTHING THAT SHE SAYS, AND WHILE I\nCERTAINLY HAVE SOME PROBLEMS WITH THIS QUESTION OF\nSURROUNDING THE E-MAILS AND SO FORTH, I THINK SHE WOULD MAKE A\nBETTER PRESIDENT THAN DONALD TRUMP, AND I ALSO THINK THAT IT\nIS THE WAY TO SAVE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\nSO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE REPUBLICANS WHO ARE ON THE FENCE\nGET OFF THE FENCE, AND SAY THAT THEY'LL VOTE FOR HILLARY CLINTON\nFOR PRESIDENT. >> THE REALITY WITHIN YOUR PARTY\nIS THAT HE GOT THE MOST VOTES OF ANY GOP PRIMARY RUNNER EVER.\nAND THE REASON IN LARGE PART OTHER THAN HIS CHARISMA AND WHAT\nHE WAS SAYING IS HE TAPPED INTO DISGUST OF THE STATUS QUO.\nAND FOR MANY OF HIS SUPPORTERS, HILLARY CLINTON CHECKS EVERY BOX\nOF STATUS QUO, AND THAT'S THE METAPHOR OF WHAT THE E-MAIL\nSCANDAL OR CLINTON FOUNDATION SITUATION PLAYS INTO.\nWHY DON'T YOU SEE IT THEIR WAY? >> WELL, YOU KNOW, I DON'T LIKE\nTHE STATUS QUO EITHER. I DON'T THINK MANY PEOPLE LIKE\nTHE STATUS QUO, PERIOD. BUT HE ALSO RECEIVED THE MOST\nVOTES AGAINST HIM OF ANYBODY IN MY PARTY.\nAND MY PROBLEM WITH DONALD TRUMP IS TEMPERAMENT.\nI DON'T THINK THAT HE IS QUALIFIED OR FIT TO SIT IN THE\nOVAL OFFICE. YOU KNOW, THE SAME GROUP THAT I\nJUST QUOTED SAID THAT HE WOULD BE THE MOST RECKLESS PRESIDENT\nIN AMERICAN HISTORY. THERE IS NO WAY WE CAN PROVE\nTHAT BUT I REALLY DO THINK THAT HIS ACTIONS, CERTAINLY DURING\nTHE CAMPAIGN, AND PROBABLY OVER THE LAST QUARTER XENRY --\nCENTURY OR SO WOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT HIM MAKING DECISION ABOUT\nWHAT TO DO ABOUT NORTH KOREA NOW GETTING MISSILES THAT CAN BE PUT\nON SUBMARINES AND CAN REACH THE UNITED STATES AT SOME POINT.\nTHAT'S NOT THE KIND OF PERSON I WANT IN THE WHITE HOUSE.\n>> JAMES GLASSMAN, A VERY INTERESTING CONVERSATION.\nNEVER HAD ONE LIKE IT IN ANY ELECTION BEFORE THIS ONE.\nTHANK YOU FOR BEING ON \"NEW DAY.\"\nAPPRECIATE IT.",

HIS ARGUMENT IS, AND THIS IS AN\nARGUMENT WE HEARD FROM NEWT GINGRICH AND OTHER CONSERVATIVES\nOVER THE YEARS, RAND PAUL TRIED TO MAKE THIS POINT EARLY IN HIS\nCAREER. MANY OF THE POLICIES THAT THEY\nHAVE MADE FOR A BETTER LIFE, BUT I THINK THAT WITHOUT THE\nSPECIFICS, I THINK IT JUST DOES NOT HELP HIS ARGUMENT BECAUSE IT\nIS JUST SO BROAD AND VAGUE. >> AND WHAT YOU I DID?\n>> IT IS A SCHOOLYARD TAUNT. LOOK, THIS IS NOT A NEW DEBATE,\nRIGHT? GEORGE W. BUSH HAD A FAMOUS\nLINE, THE SOFT BIGOTRY OF LOW EXPECTATIONS.\nHE THOUGHT IT WOULD HELP MINORITY COMMUNITIES MORE THAN\nWHAT DEMOCRATS WERE OFFERING. THOSE TOUGHER ON CRIME SAY THAT\nWILL HELP UNDERSERVED NEIGHBOR THAT'S HAVE HIGHER CRIME RATES,\nRIGHT? YOU CAN MAKE A POLICY CASE THAT\nHAS RACIAL IMPLICATIONS OF WHY CONSERVATIVE IDEALS ARE BETTER\nTHAN OTHERS. SO, AGAIN WITH TRUMP, HE WOULD\nBE A LOT BETTER CANDIDATE IF HE GOT SPECIFIC AND TALKED ABOUT\nDETAILED POLICIES. >> WE'RE STILL SEEING HIM\nSTRUGGLE TO STICK TO SOMETHING. IF HE DIDN'T SAY BIGOT BEFORE,\nAND THEN HE DOUBLES DOWN, IT SEEMS LIKE HE IS TAKING HIMSELF\nOFF MESSAGE A LITTLE BIT. >> A LITTLE BIT.\n>> HE DOES THIS FREQUENTLY. >> MANY TIMES BEFORE.\nI FEEL LIKE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HIM FROM A MESSAGES PERFECTIVE,\nA POLICY PERSPECTIVE, ANY POLITICAL PERSPECTIVE IS LIKE\nPLAYING WHACK A MOLE. YOU HIT ONE ON THE HEAD, YOU\nTHINK YOU HAVE TO DOWN AND ANOTHER ONE POPS UP IN A\nDIFFERENT PLACE, AND YOU'RE CONSTANTLY ON THE RUN AND\nCHASING THINGS DOWN. BUT DONALD TRUMP, THERE IS NO\nCLARITY IN TERMS OF MESSAGING OR POLICY.\nMAYBE IN SOME SENSES THAT HAS BEEN TO HIS ADVANTAGE.\nNO ONE CAN SAY WITH ANY SORT OF DEFINITIVENESS WHAT HE BELIEVES.\nPEOPLE CAN MAKE OF HIM WHATEVER THEY WANT.\nON THE OTHER SIDE, THAT IS VERY NEGATIVE BECAUSE HE IS TRYING TO\nPROVE TO PEOPLE HE IS QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT, HE HAS THE\nEXPERIENCE, AND HIS POLICY PRESCRIPTIONS ARE BEST FOR THE\nCOUNTRY. IF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE\nPOLICY PRESCRIPTIONS ARE, THAT IS A PROBLEM.\n>> WE'RE HOPING TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY ARE WHEN IT COMES TO\nIMMIGRATION BECAUSE HE IS EXPECTED TO UNVEIL IN HIS SPEECH\nTODAY, AND IT SEEMS UNCLEAR WHERE HE IS OTHER THAN IT SEEMS\nLIKE HE SOFTEN ON SOME THINGS, LIKE HE WILL PERHAPS DESCRIBE\nSOMETHING THAT OTHERS CONSIDER AMNESTY, BUT HE WILL TRY TO\nCHARACTERIZE -- WHAT HE HE SAY? IT'S NOT AMNESTY AS SUCH.\n>> RIGHT, AND THIS GOES TO THE HEART OF THE DEBATE IN THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY FOR A DECADE NOW.\nWHAT IS AMNESTY. IT IS SUCH A DIRTY WORD, EVEN\nTHOUGH RONALD REAGAN DID IT. HE LET PEOPLE STAY, BUT WITH\nREGARD TO THIS DEBATE, LAST NIGHT, NO QUESTION, THAT DONALD\nTRUMP LEFT A VERY STRONG IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS CHANGING\nTHE PART OF HIS PRIMARY IMMIGRATION POLICY WHICH IT WAS\nTO TAKE EVERYBODY AND DEPORT THEM, BUT LET THE GOOD ONES IN\nIN HIS WORDS, AND TO SAY NOW MAYBE HE WOULD NOT FORCE THE\nGOOD ONES, THE PEOPLE THAT HAD NOT COMMITTED ANY CRIMES, TO\nLEAVE. THE QUESTION IS WHAT ARE THE\nDETAILS OF THAT.

FIRST TO YOU, DAVID, WHAT WAS\nSHE TRYING TO DO TODAY AND DID SHE ACCOMPLISH IT?\n>> I THINK SHE WAS TRYING TO DO TWO THINGS TODAY.\nTRYING TO DISQUALIFY DONALD TRUMP.\nSHE SPENT MUCH OF ARGUENDOING THE TEMPERAMENT ARGUMENT.\nNOW THAT HE IS SO FRINGE HE SHOULD NOT EVEN BE IN THE\nCONVERSATION. SO CONTINUING THAT ARGUMENT.\nANOTHER THING IS TALK TO MODERATE REPUBLICANS IN THE\nMIDDLE SAYING HEY, GUYS, THIS DOES NOT REPRESENT YOUR PARTY.\nI HAVE SOME REPUBLICANS ON BOARD, THIS IS WHY YOU SHOULD\nTHINK ABOUT COMING ON BOARD AS WELL.\n>> TO DAVID'S POINT THERE, TARGETING REPUBLICANS HERE, SHE\nWENT AFTER DONALD TRUMP, BUT SHE ALSO DEFENDED A NUMBER OF\nREPUBLICANS. HE HIGHLIGHTED THAT SHE BETWEEN\nTHE A MOSQUE AFTER 9/11. IS SHE TRYING TO TELL\nREPUBLICANS COME TO MY SIDE, OR IS SHE SAYING DON'T GO IT HIS,\nMAYBE JUST STAY HOME? >> AND THE QUESTION IS IS THERE\nA DIFFERENCE AT THIS POINT FROM HER PERSPECTIVE.\nTHERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS, BUT YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT.\nBY BRINGING UP BOB DOLE AND JOHN McCAIN AND GEORGE W. BUSH, IN\nINSTANCES WHERE THEY ALL EXPLICITLY SAID THERE IS NO ROOM\nFOR HATE OR INTOLERANCE IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, IT HELPED HER\nILLUSTRATE HER SPEECH THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS TAKEN OVER THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY AND THE FRINGE HAS TAKEN OVER THE REPUBLICAN\nPARTY. I WAS JUST LOOKING DOWN AT MY\nPHONE BECAUSE WE GOT A STATEMENT FROM KELLYANNE CONWAY, SAYING\nTHAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS NO VISION FOR OUR FUTURE.\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS NOT NOT HAD THE GREATEST WEEK WHEN IT COMES\nTO HER E-MAILS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE.\n>> SAYING HILLARY CLINTON IS TRYING TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT, IS\nTHERE ANY TRUTH TO THAT? >> SHE HAS CHANGED THE SUBJECT,\nRIGHT? AT LEAST FOR TODAY.\nIT IS TRUE THIS HAS NOT BEEN HILLARY CLINTON'S BEST WEEK IN\nTERMS OF THIS CAMPAIGN. NOT ONLY BECAUSE TRUMP TRIED TO\nSOFTEN HIS TONE AND SOME OF HIS CONTROVERSIAL POLICIES, BUT ALSO\nTHE CLINTON FOUNDATIONS. SO THIS IS BENEFICIAL TO HER TO\nTRY TO DIRECT THE CONVERSATION BACK TO DONALD TRUMP IS SHOWN AS\nUNFIT FOR THE PRESIDENCY. WE'RE NOT TALKING A LOT ABOUT\nPOLICY AT THIS STAGE. BOTH SIDES ARE TRYING TO MAKE\nTHE CASE THAT THE OTHER CANDIDATE IS FUNDAMENTALLY UNFIT\nTO TAKE THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY.\nI THINK THAT IS PRETTY UNPRECEDENTED.\nAND THE OTHER SIDE WANTS TO LABEL THEIR OPPONENT.\nTHAT IS WHAT TODAY IN POLITICS, IT IS THAT LABELLING.\n>> IT IS CHARACTER ASSASSINATION, RIGHT?\nMUTUAL CHARACTER ASSASSINATION. >> DONALD TRUMP HAS A LOT OF\nFACTS ON HIS SIDE. HE GOES OFF INTO, WELL I DON'T\nREALLY BELIEVE YOU ANY MORE WHEN HE SAYS THE STATE DEPARTMENT WAS\nA VAST ENTERPRISE. HILLARY CLINTON HAS A LOT OF\nFACTS, BUT SHE DELIVERED THE HISTORY OF TRUMP NAP IS VERY\nPOWERFUL. SO I THINK --\n>> SHE IS REPEATING HIS WORDS, RIGHT?\n>> YES, AND TALKING ABOUT THE FAILURE TO CONDEMN DUKE.\nAND THAT SHE BROUGHT ON SOMEONE FROM BREITBART, THOSE ARE FACTS\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS TO DEAL WITH THAT.\nI THINK SHE DID SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING TODAY IN THAT SHE\nSEPARATED THE REPUBLICAN PARTY FROM SOME OF THE IDEOLOGY THAT\nENTERS THE PARTY THROUGH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.\nSHE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT. THE HOUSE DEMOCRATS, SENATE\nDEMOCRATS, ARE ALL OUT THERE TRYING TO TIE SIS WORTH THINGS\nTO THE DOWN BALLOT -- >> SPECIFICALLY REACHING OUT TO\nREPUBLICANS WHO ARE NOT COMFORTABLE, NECESSARILY, FOR\nSOMEONE LIKE DONALD TRUMP TO SAY THAT FOR ME, THE OPEN QUESTION\nIS WHETHER OR NOT IT IS ENOUGH TO HEAR THAT FROM HILLARY\nCLINTON. THEY ARE LOOKING AT THEIR\nCHOICES SAYING WE DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY WE'RE GOING TO GO.\n>> LET'S LOOK AT THIS VIDEO THAT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN RELEASED\nAHEAD OF HER SPEECH. >> SENDING OUT ALL OF THE\nILL ILLEGALS, BUILDING A WALL, A\nMORATORIUM ON ISLAMIC IMMIGRATION.\nTHAT IS APPEALING TO A LOT OF PEOPLE.\n>> IT IS REALLY TREMENDOUS SON. >> ARE.\n>> Leigh: YOU C-- WILL YOU COND DAVID DUKE?\n>> I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WHITE SUPREMACISTS, SO I DON'T\nKNOW. >> WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE IN THE\nMIDDLE OF THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM.\nMODERATES, MAYBE INDEPENDENTS, MAYBE THEY HAVE REAM MISDIVINGS\nABOUT HILLARY CLINTON, DOES TELLING THEM IF YOU ARE\nCONSIDERING DONALD TRUMP, THAT YOU'RE CONSIDERING A RACIST\nMAYBE BACKFIRING A LITTLE BIT. AND ALTERNATIVE TO YOU INSTEAD\nOF A RACIST. >> I THINK THE PREDICATE FOR THE\nSTATEMENT IS EVERYTHING. IF SHE STICKS TO THE FACTS,\nSTICKS TO THINGS THAT TRUMP SAID, OR ENDORSES, OR PEOPLE\nTHAT ARE COMING TO HIS CAMPAIGN WELCOME I THINK THAT IS POWERFUL\nIF THE FACTS ARE NOT THERE. THEN IT IS NOT, AND THEN IT IS\nJUST A SMIER. I THOUGHT IT WAS POWERFUL WHEN\nSHE LAID OUT THE POINTS FROM BREITBART.\n>> THERE COULD BE A POTENTIAL FOR THAT --\n>> MAYBE THERE ISN'T, I THINK IT IS A SMART QUESTION, I JUST\nTHINK THAT THESE TWO PEOPLE ARE UNIQUELY DISLIKED IN AMERICAN\nPOLITICS, AS THE NOMINEES, AND THE GAME HAS BECOME ABOUT MAKING\nTHE OTHER MOST DISLIKED PERSON THAT I THINK YOU WOULD --\nWHATEVER YOU MAY RISK LOSING FROM DOING SO, YOU MAY PICK UP\nSOME PEOPLE. >> THANK YOU SO ALL OF YOU.\nJOINING ME NOW, REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN OF CALIFORNIA.\nDO I HAVE TO GET IN A QUICK BREAK BUT WE HAVE MORE TO TALK\nABOUT TODAY.

WHAT DO YOU WANT?\n>> ACTUALLY, FOR ME, IT WAS A DEPICTION OF A SINGLE EVENT.\nBUT I ALSO CALCULATED THAT EVERYBODY ELSE WOULD BRING THEIR\nOWN PROJECTIONS TO IT. SO FROM THE VERY BEGINNING, OUR\nJOB WAS JUST TO FOCUS ON HOW CAN WE MAKE THIS FEEL REAL.\nHOW CAN WE RECREATE THE MOMENT IN TIME.\nBUT THEN ASSUMING THAT EVERY SINGLE AUDIENCE MEMBER WOULD\nBRING THEIR OWN EXTRA LAYER OF POLITICS, THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO\nTHE OBAMAS, THEIR OWN SORT OF FEELINGS ABOUT THE\nADMINISTRATION, AND THAT WILL CHANGE OVER TIME, IT WILL BE\nDIFFERENT FOR EVERY PERSON.

BUT SPEAKING OF THE WALKING\nTHROUGH, CHICAGO AND JUST THIS SUMMER DAY, IT IS BEING LIKENED\nBY THE \"WASHINGTON POST\" TO THE RICHARD LINK BEFORE SUNRISE,\nWHICH IS THE MOST ROMANTIC MOVIE EVER.\nIT IS JUST SORT OF, NOT A LOT OF ACTION, BUT YET SOMETHING\nCHEMICAL HAPPENS. >> YEAH, YEAH, AND I MEAN, THAT\nCHEMICAL THING THAT HAPPENS IS KIND OF INTANGIBLE THING THAT\nHAPPENS WITH PARKER AND TIKA WHEN YOU PUT A CAMERA ON THEM.\nIT IS THE THING THAT HAPPENS WITH SPENCER AND TRACIE, MEG\nRYAN AND TOM HANKS. >> HIGH PRAISE.\nHIGH PRAISE FROM THE DIRECTOR. >> WHEN THE CAMERA GOES ON, THEY\nHAVE THAT ROMANTIC KPCHEMISTRY D IT MAKES THE MOVIE WORK.\n>> SO THEN YOU HAVE, YOU CAN'T ESCAPE, I GUESS WHAT WOULD BE\nCALLED THE HISTORY OF IT, WHICH IS WHERE THIS WINDS UP LEADING\nUS ULTIMATELY, AND YOU HAVE THE FIRST DATE THAT THEY HAD AND\nTHEIR MOMENT AFTER THEY ENTER THE WHITE HOUSE TOGETHER, WHICH\nIS GOING TO BE A PIVOTABLE ONE AS WELL.\nHOW DO YOU SEE THE TRANSITION OF THIS?\n>> FROM MOVIE TO MOVIE? >> YES.\n>> WELL, I'M NOT SIGNED UP TO DO A SEQUEL.\n>> THAT'S IT.

ONCE WE GET CLARITY ON YELLEN, I\nTHINK THE NARRATIVE WILL STAY WITH THE U.S. AND IT WILL LOOK\nFORWARD TO THE PAYROLLS NUMBER, BUT IT WILL ALSO COME BACK TO\nTHE REGION BECAUSE WE GOT A PLETHORA OF PMI NUMBERS COMING\nOUT. WE ALSO GOT THE LATEST READ ON\nINDIA'S ECONOMY. GOT GDP NUMBERS COMING OUT FROM\nINDIA. THAT WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT.\nINDIA, INDONESIA, AND THE PHILIPPINES IN TERMS OF\nSOVEREIGN MARKETS ARE THE ONES REALLY PUNCHING ABOVE THEIR\nWEIGHT RIGHT NOW AND CRACKING ON WITH STRUCTURE REFORM AND THE\nMARKETS LIKE THAT AND THE MARKETS ARE REWAFRDING THEM.\n>> THANK YOU FOR THAT UPDATE AND FINALLY WE CAN ALL REST EASY\nAFTER JANET YELLEN'S SPEECH IN JACKSON HOLE TONIGHT.\nHAVE A GREAT WEEKEND.",

KATE KELLY, BRING US UP TO\nSPEED. CARL ICAHN APPARENTLY WANTS TO\nSELL.

SO THEY HAD BEEN SHOPPING AND IN\nRECENT WEEKS SINCE THIS FTC SETTLEMENT ON JULY 15th WITH A\nDEMAND THAT HERBALIFE CHANGE ITS BUSINESS PRACTICES IN A $200\nMILLION SETTLEMENT, APPARENTLY ICAHN WANTS OUT.\nWE'RE NOT SURE OF THE MOTIVATION.\nTHEY TRIED TO PUT TOGETHER A CONSORTIUM OF BUYERS AND ALONG\nTHE WAY APPROACHED BILL ACKMAN IF HE WOULD BE INTERESTED AND HE\nBRIEFLY CONSIDERED IT. THE REASON I'M TALKING TO YOU\nRIGHT NOW IS I GOT ACKMAN ON THE PHONE THIS MORNING.\nHE CALLED INTO \"SQUAWK BOX\" AND I INTERVIEWED HIM.\nAND HE BASICALLY SAID, YES, THIS IS TRUE.\nAND, YES, I CONSIDERED BUYING A FEW MILLION SHARES, MAYBE 3\nMILLION, BECAUSE I WANT CARL OUT.\nI'M STILL SHORT THE STOCK. I STILL THINK IT'S GOING DOWN,\nIF NOT TO ZERO AND IF IT'S A MEANS TO AN END, I BUY A FEW\nSHARES PLAN TO SELL THE NEXT DAY JUST TO GET CARL OUT, THAT'S\nGREAT.

AND THEY SAY THEY'RE ROLLING\nTHIS OUT AROUND THE WORLD, I WOULD SAY AROUND THE WORLD.\nSO FROM THIS POINT ON AT LEAST OVER THE NEXT YEAR IT WOULD SEEM\nLIKE HERBALIFE IS LIKE A BIOTECH STOCK.\nIT'S A SPECULATIVE STOCK. THEY'RE CURRENTLY IN PHASE ONE\nTRIALS. THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN PHASE TWO\nTRIALS AND BY THE END OF THE YEAR, 12 MONTHS, PHASE THREE\nTRIALS. >> YEAR-TO-DATE STILL HIGHER BY\n9.5%, RON. >> YEAH, MY WHOLE VIEW OF\nHERBALIFE IS NEVER HAS THERE BEEN SUCH AN INTENSE TEST OF\nMANHOOD OVER SUCH AN INCONSEQUENTIAL STOCK.\nAND I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON BETWEEN MR.

I GRANT YOU.\nBUT IN ALL SERIOUSNESS, BILL ACKMAN MADE A PRETTY BRASH MOVE\nHERE, A PRETTY AGGRESSIVE MOVE IN TERMS OF A BILLION DOLLAR\nSHORT THAT HE'S NOW BEEN IN FOR OVER FOUR YEARS, SAYING THE\nCOMPANY WAS A PYRAMID SCHEME, OPENING HIMSELF UP TO ALL SORTS\nOF LIABILITIES WITH THAT ALONE. AND THEN ICAHN TAKING THE OTHER\nSIDE OF IT SAYING IT WAS A GREAT COMPANY, WINDING UP ON THE\nBOARD, SORT OF EXHORTING OTHER PEOPLE TO GET INVOLVED ON THE\nLONG SIDE. I MEAN, IT MAY BE AN\nINCONSEQUENTIAL STOCK IN THE SCHEME OF THINGS, RON, BUT WHAT\nTHESE GUYS DID AND THE CAPITAL THAT THEY PUT BEHIND IT IS\nREALLY SIGNIFICANT. >> WELL, TO ME THAT'S THE PART\nTHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IN A CERTAIN SENSE.\nAND BILL ACKMAN, AS YOU DISCUSSED WITH HIM THIS MORNING,\nKATE, HIS PERFORMANCE SINCE THE LAST YEAR HAS BEEN ABYSMAL.\nWON THE BAD BET ON VALEANT, AND TWO THE BAD BET ON HERBALIFE.\n>> WE TALKED ABOUT THAT AND HE BLAMES THAT ALMOST 100% ON\nVALEANT. SAID I'VE NEVER BEEN IN SUCH A\nBAD STOCK POSITION AS THIS IN MY ENTIRE HISTORY AS AN INVESTOR AS\nI HAVE WITH VALEANT. BUT BY THE WAY HE THEN ON THE\nTAIL END COMPARED THE SITUATION WITH VALEANT TO GENERAL GROWTH\nPROPERTIES. >> RIGHT.\n>> AT THE TIME WHEN IT WAS IN BANKRUPTCY OR CLOSE TO IT.\nSO OBVIOUSLY HE'S SORT OF TOUTING A POTENTIALLY GREAT\nOUTCOME THERE. >> HERB, LET'S TALK ABOUT IN\nTHAT CASE GENERAL GROWTH PROPERTIES, HE BOUGHT LOW AND\nSOLD HIGH. HERB, RIGHT NOW ACKMAN HAS\nBOUGHT HIGH, AND I DON'T KNOW IF HE SOLD, BUT HE HAS BEEN\nOBLITERATED IN HERBALIFE. HE'S BEEN OBLITERATED IN\nVALEANT. HE CAN BLAME VALEANT ALL HE\nWANTS. BUT IT'S LIKE IF YOU BOUGHT\nEXXON THE DAY BEFORE THE BOTTOM DROPPED OUT OF OIL, THAT'S WHAT\nYOU DO AS AN INVESTOR, YOUR ENTIRE JOB IS SUPPOSED TO BE\nSMARTER THAN THE MARKET. IN YOUR LONG ILLUSTRIOUS\nHISTORY, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN AN INVESTOR HANG ONTO A POSITION\nLIKE THIS? >> YES.\nHE DID WITH NBIA. >> YES.\nI HAVE TO TELL YOU WE GET SO USED TO THIS SHORT TERM OF FOCUS\nTHAT THERE ARE INVESTOR WHO IS HAVE VERY LONG TERM VIEWS.\nAND THERE ARE INVESTORS WHO MAYBE -- I WAS HAVING LUNCH WITH\nA VERY GOOD HEDGE FUND MANAGER THE OTHER DAY WHO WAS IN SAN\nDIEGO, AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS.\nAND HE HAS STICKY MONEY. AND HE CAN TAKE VERY LONG TERM\nVIEWS OF THINGS. AND IF YOU HAVE A VERY LONG TERM\nVIEW, YOU CAN TAKE WHATEVER VIEW, YOU CAN TRADE AROUND IT.\nBUT THERE ARE -- LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, ON SOME OF THESE\nSITUATIONS THE SHORTS GET INTO ARE TROUBLED COMPANIES, BROKEN\nBUSINESS MODELS, OTHER TYPES OF ISSUES, SOMETIMES IT TAKES YEARS\nTO PLAY OUT. BUT WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO\nDO -- >> I CAN AGREE WITH YOUR\nARGUMENT. I CAN AGREE WITH HERB'S ARGUMENT\nON THE LONG SIDE BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOUR LOSSES.\nA SHORT INVESTMENT FOR A FIRM THAT I WOULD IMAGINE LIKE\nACKMAN, KATE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, PROBABLY HAS PENSION\nFUNDS AND SOME PUBLIC TRUST MONEY PUT INTO IT TO DO A SHORT\nWHERE YOUR LOSSES ARE UNLIMITED. >> BRIAN, THE STORY I WAS DOING\nTHIS MORNING ORIGINALLY AND THEN SORT OF I STUMBLED UPON THIS\nOTHER SITUATION WITH HERBALIFE, WAS ABOUT PENSION FUNDS\nREDEEMING FROM HEDGE FUNDS, INCLUDING PERSHING SQUARE,\nGETTING SOME REDEMPTION INCLUDING THE ILLINOIS STATE\nPENSION, FOR EXAMPLE. LUCKILY FOR ACKMAN HE HAS THIS\nEIGHT-QUARTER REDEMPTION POLICY AND CLAIMS THE REDEMPTION HE'S\nSEEING NOW IS NOT HISTORIC -- ANYWAY, I WON'T GO ON.\nBUT I JUST THINK ACKMAN HAS ACTUALLY PUT QUITE A LOT OF\nRESEARCH INTO THIS HERBALIFE SHORT AS HERB KNOWS VERY WELL.\nI THINK SOME PEOPLE IN THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY THINK HE'S\nACTUALLY CORRECT ON THE MERITS OF HIS ARGUMENT.\nIT'S JUST THAT THE FTC SETTLEMENT WAS NOT AS DIRE FOR\nTHE COMPANY AS HE MIGHT HAVE PREDICTED.\n>> ALL RIGHT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANKS.\nHERB, SORRY, WE GOT TO GO. SORRY.\n>> SURE, OKAY. >> WE'LL ARGUE ANOTHER TIME.\n>> BECAUSE, AS KATE MENTIONED, SPEAKING OF ACKMAN AND ICAHN AND\nAMAZING PIECES OF VIDEO, WHO COULD FORGET BOTH OF THEM\nHUGGING IT OUT ON STAGE. DELIVERING ALPHA TWO YEARS AGO.\nDOES IT LOOK LIKE THEY LIKE EACH OTHER?\nTWO TALL RICH GUYS.

THAT HE STILL BELIEVES IN ITS\nBUSINESS MODEL. THAT HE THINKS HERBALIFE'S\nIMPACT ON SOCIETY IS POSITIVE, AND THAT HE HAS A LOT OF\nCONFIDENCE IN CARL ICAHN AS WELL.\nSO I THINK PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO GET THEIR SCORE CARDS OUT TODAY\nAND FIND OUT WHERE ALL OF THE BIGGEST HOLDERS ARE IN LIEU OF\nTHIS LATEST REPORT. >> AND SHOULD BE NOTED THAT JUST\nBECAUSE CARL ICAHN IS LOOKING TO EXIT HIS STAKE, IT DOESN'T\nNECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE STOCK WON'T CONTINUE TO GO HIGHER.\nWE'VE SEEN CARL EXIT POSITIONS BEFORE.\nPRETTY BIG GAINS, IN LIONSGATE AND CELESTIAL, STILL MORE UPSIDE\nTO COME. >> THIS IS SUCH A UNIQUE STORY\nIN AND OF ITSELF, MELISSA. IT'S HARD TO, I GUESS, READ INTO\nTHE BIG PICTURE WHERE HERBALIFE SHARES ARE GOING TO GO IN THE\nFUTURE, JUST BY VIRTUE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE LONG-TERM\nIMPACT WILL BE. IF ICAHN WAS GETTING OUT, A\nNEGATIVE ON THE STOCK? OF COURSE.\nHE HAS, AS YOU GUYS SAID, 17 MILLION SHARES.\nSO JUST BY VIRTUE OF THAT LOAD BEING PUT ON THE MARKET, THE\nSTOCK WOULD CERTAINLY GO DOWN. IT WOULD ALSO BE PROBABLY VIEWED\nAS A, KNOW, A CONFIDENCE BLOW IF SOMEONE LIKE CARL ICAHN WAS TO\nGET OUT. IT PROBABLY WOULDN'T BODE WELL\nFOR SHARES.

ICAHN, HE DOESN'T TRADE\nLISTED OPTIONS. THE SORT OF STUFF I TALK ABOUT\nON HEAT SEEKER AND SO FORTH IS PROBABLY CREATED BY THE PEOPLE\nTHAT OFFER HIM THAT LIQUIDITY. WHETHER IT'S A TRADING DESK AT\nJEFFRIES OR GOLDMAN SACHS OR WHEREVER HE IS.\nGOING THROUGH TO FIND THAT LIQUIDITY -- OVER THE\nCOUNTEROPTION, THOSE PEOPLE THAT PROVIDE THAT LIQUIDITY ARE\nHEDGING DOWN TO ABOUT THE 45 STRIKE IN FEBRUARY.\nSO THAT'S A DECENT LITTLE SELL-OFF FROM WHERE IT IS RIGHT\nNOW TO YOUR POINT, SCOTT. >> THE OTHER INTERESTING THING,\nGUYS, TO CONSIDER IS THAT, YOU KNOW, LET'S NOT FORGET, CARL\nICAHN IS NOT ONLY ONE OF THE, THE LARGEST INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDER, BUT A HANDFUL OF\nBOARD SEATS AS WELL. SO JUST COMPLICATES THE WHOLE\nISSUE OF AN EXIT. NOT ONLY HAVE TO GET SOMEBODY TO\nTAKE THE OTHER SIDE, IF YOU WILL, OF CARL, WHICH MAY NOT BE\nEASY TO DO, AND YOU KNOW, BILL ACKMAN TOLD KATE KEL AROUND THE\nFOLKS ON \"SQUAWK BOX\" THIS MORNING HE WOULD HAVE BEEN\nWILLING TO DO THAT A LITTLE BIT AT A LOSS JUST TO GET CARL OUT.\nWHY WOULD BIG ACKMAN WANT CARL OUT?\nOBVIOUSLY WHAT I SAID EARLIER. HE KNOWS CARL ICAHN'S GETTING\nOUT WOULD BE A NEGATIVE ON THE STOCK, BUT I GUESS THE POINT I'M\nTRYING TO MAKE IS THAT IT'S JUST MORE DIFFICULT FOR SOMEONE LIKE\nCARL ICAHN, THE SIZE OF INVESTOR HE IS AND ALSO THE FACT HE HAS A\nHANDFUL OF BOARD SEATS, TO MAKE AN EXIT.\nBUT BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT AFTER THE SETTLEMENT HAPPENED WITH THE\nFTC, VOLUME IN HERBALIFE SHARES HAD SPIKED TO A LEVEL THAT WOULD\nHAVE AT LEAST OPENED A WINDOW TO AN INSIDER TO BE ABLE TO MAKE\nTHAT KIND OF MOVE, IF ONE WANTED TO DO SO.\nSO, YOU KNOW, OB OBVIOUSLY, THERE ARE VARIOUS RULES AT PLAY\nTHAT LIMITS INSIDER TO SELL WHEN THEY CAN BY VIRTUE OF THE\nKNOWLEDGE THEY HAVE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE BUSINESS, BUT\nIN THAT PERIOD RIGHT AFTER THE SETTLEMENT WITH THE FTC, VOLUME\nIN HERBALIFE SHARES HAD SPIKED TOE DRAMATICALLY COMPARED TO\nTHEIR AVERAGE DAILY OR WEEKLY  WINDOW, GIVEN ICAHN, THE WAY I\nUNDERSTAND IT, FROM A RULES STANDPOINT TO MAKE THAT KIND OF\nA MOVE. AN INTERESTING ANECDOTE TO ADD\nTO THE WHOLE WEIGHT THAT THIS STORY IS BEING THOUGHT OF TODAY.\n>> ALL RIGHT. SCOTT, LET YOU GO AND ENXWLI IS\nLEFT OF YOUR VACATION.

STERRITZ HE STILL HOLDS SHARES\nOF HERBALIFE AND WOULD NOT CHARACTERIZE THE SIZE OF HIS\nPOSITION, WHETHER HE HAS SOLD ANY OF THOSE SHARES JUST SAYING\nTHAT HE BELIEVES IN CARL ICAHN AND HE CONTINUES TO BELIEVE IN\nTHE HERBALIFE BUSINESS. IT'S ANOTHER LITTLE PIECE OF THE\nSTORY AS WE CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THESE LARGE HOLDERS OF HERBALIFE\nAND WHAT THEY MAY BE TRYING TO DO WITH THEIR POSITIONS, CARL\nICAHN AND BILL STIR RITZ INCLUDED.\n>> HOW LONG UNTIL WE GET ICAHN'S REACTION TO ACKMAN SAYING I\nTHINK HE KNOWS IT'S TOAST? >> MAYBE WHEN THE ALARM CLOCK\nGOES OFF. I THINK WE'RE STILL -- WE'RE\nSTILL WAITING. LOOK, I'VE TRIED TO GET IN TOUCH\nWITH CARL AS MUCH AS PROBABLY THE REST OF THE FREE WORLD HAS\nTHIS MORNING, IF I HEAR BACK I'LL CERTAINLY LET YOU KNOW.\nMAYBE YOU'LL HEAR BEFORE THAT. I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM CARL\nAND WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT THE WHOLE THING.\n>> AMAZING HOW THE BACK AND FORTH CONTINUES TO HAPPEN IN A\nPUBLIC REALM. MORE SO THAN A LOT OF OTHER\nSTOCK SAGAS. THANK YOU FOR ADDING COLOR TO\nIT. WE HOPE TO TALK TO YOU LATER IN\nTHE MORNING. SCOTT WAPNER WORKING WHEN HE\nSHOULD BE RESTING. WHEN HE COME BACK MARKETS\nREACTING TO YELLEN'S SPEECH IN JAX JACKSON HOLE GOLD IS UP 16\nBUCKS, OIL UP ABOUT A BUCK. BACK IN A MINUTE.",

WHAT A STORY THIS MORNING.\n>> I KNOW, CARL. ANDREW AND I TALKING ABOUT IT ON\nSET IN THE 6:00 HOUR SCRATCHING OUR HEADS BECAUSE \"THE WALL\nSTREET JOURNAL\" HAD WRITTEN A STORY SUGGESTING ACKMAN WAS\nGOING TO AT LEAST PARTLY BUY OUT CARL ICAHN.\nI TALKED TO ACKMAN AND HE CALLED THE SHOW.\nHE ESSENTIALLY SAID HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED.\nJEFFERIES WAS WORKING ON ICAHN'S BEHALF TO HELP HIM SELL OUT OF\nHIS 17 MILLION SHARE PLUS POSITION WHICH BY THE WAY MAKES\nHIM THE TOP SHAREHOLDER IN HERBALIFE AND THEY ASKED ACKMAN\nIF HE WOULD BE INTERESTED. HE SAID ABSOLUTELY NOT.\nTHEY CAME BACK TO HIM A SECOND TIME AND SAID, WE'RE TRYING TO\nPUT TOGETHER A GROUP OF BUYERS ARE YOU IN, AND ACKMAN SAID ON\nSECOND THOUGHT I WOULD BE WILLING TO BUY A FEW MILLION\nSHARES IF ONLY TO HELP GET CARL OUT.\nI'M GOING TO FLIP IT THE VERY NEXT DAY BECAUSE I'M STILL VERY,\nVERY SHORT THIS STOCK AND I THINK IT'S GOING WAY DOWN.\nHERE'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE SIGNAL THAT CARL ICAHN'S\nPOTENTIAL BLOCK SALE SENDS TO THE MARKET ABOUT HERBALIFE.\nTAKE A LISTEN. >> CARL, I WOULD SAY IS THE LEADER OF WHAT CREATES THE\nCONFIDENCE IN THE COMPANY. WITH CARL EXITING IT'S OVER AND\nOVER QUICKLY. THE SOONER HE SELLS THE BETTER.\n>> SO, OBVIOUSLY, VERY NEGATIVE TERMS COMING FROM ACKMAN ABOUT\nWHAT THE ICAHN SALE COULD MEAN AND HE SAID THAT SOME OF THE\nMAJOR LONG HOLDERS IT WAS HIS BELIEF AT LEAST WERE ON THEIR\nWAY TO GETTING OUT INCLUDING FIDELITY AND ALSO BILL STEERITS.\nWE HAVE CALLS TO FIND OUT IF THAT'S THE CASE.  IF IT IS IT HAS NOT SHOWN UP IN\nTHE SECURITIES FILINGS YET. WE KNOW THAT ACKMAN IS VERY,\nVERY SHORT THE STOCK. IT'S BEEN FAMOUSLY CALLED THE\nBILLION DOLLAR SHORT. HE DOES NOT DISPUTE.\nHOWEVER IT WOULD COST HIM POTENTIALLY MONEY TO BUY ICAHN'S\nSHARES EVEN IF HE WERE GOING TO FLIP THEM IN A DAY.\nHERE'S WHEN HE SAID ABOUT THE ECONOMIC OF THAT.\nTAKE AS LISTEN. >> IF I BOUGHT 3 MILLION SHARES\nAT 55 AND I TOLD THEM AT 45, YOU KNOW, I'LL LOSE $30 MILLION BUT\nWE'VE GOT MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLAR SHORT POSITION AND\nGETTING CARL OUT WOULD HELP. I WOULD SPEND $30 MILLION TO GET\nCARL OUT. I WOULD SPEND MORE.\n>> SO CARL, YOU CAN SEE WHY THIS MIGHT MAKE ECONOMIC SENSE TO\nACKMAN. IT'S AN INTERESTING AND IRONIC\nNEW TWIST TO WHAT, OF COURSE, IS A VERY LONG RUNNING STORY ABOUT\nTWO TITANS OF INVESTMENT ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THIS HERBALIFE\nTRADE. >> VERY CURIOUS, I WONDER AND\nWE'VE GOT SARA AND MIKE HERE AS WELL, WHAT CARL MUST BE THINKING\nABOUT JEFFERIES AT THIS POINT. >> YEAH.\nI MEAN HIS LONG-TIME BROKER, HAVE TO FEEL THEY WANT TO SURVEY\nEVERYBODY. IN THEORY IF BILL ACKMAN HAD AN\nINTEREST IN CLOSING HIS SHORT POSITION, THIS IS AN EFFICIENT\nWAY TO DO THAT. ACTUALLY.\nIT WOULD BE AT A LOSS. UNLIKELY GIVEN WHAT HE'S BEEN\nSAYING ABOUT HERBALIFE BUT YOU TO SURVEY THE STREET AND THIS\nWHAT KATE POINTS OUT HERE IS INTERESTING, IF ACKMAN WOULD\nHAVE SEEN THIS AS A MECHANISM TO UNLOCK A HUGE CHUNK OF SUPPLY OF\nHERBALIFE STOCK AND PUT PRESSURE ON THE SHARES IT MAKES BACKDOOR\nSENSE. >> RIGHT.\nI MEAN I THINK THAT WAS THE LOGIC.\nWHEN YOU SEE THE STORY IT SEEMS BIZARRE BECAUSE ACKMAN WITHIN\nTHE LAST FEW WEEKS CERTAINLY SINCE THE FTC SETTLEMENT ON JULY\n15th WITH HERBALIFE FOR $200 MILLION OF COURSE SENT SOME\nNEGATIVE SIGNALS ABOUT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS MODEL BUT\nSTOPPED SHORT OF CALLING IT A PYRAMID SCHEME.\nACKMAN HAS SAID I'M SHORT THIS STOCK, NOT BAILING OUT OF THIS\nINVESTMENT THESIS. I THINK EARNINGS ARE GOING TO\nERODE ONCE THE COMPANY HAS TO ABIDE BY THE TERMS OF THE FTC\nSETTLEMENT AND IT MAY TAKE A LITTLE LONGER BUT THE SHARES ARE\nSTILL GOING DOWN. HOWEVER, IT'S NOT SHOCKING\nNECESSARILY TO THINK THAT HE COULD BE CHANGING HIS MIND,\nGIVEN THAT THEY DIDN'T CALL IT A PYRAMID SCHEME AND YOU DON'T SEE\nA CLEAR AND QUICK PATH TO THE STOCK GOING TO ZERO AS HE LONG\nPREDICTED. >> THE OPPOSITE, KATE.\nTHE STOCK HAS GONE IN ICAHN'S FAVOR SINCE HE DISCLOSED IT BACK\nIN FEBRUARY OF 2013. DOUBLE DIGITS HIGHER?\n>> SURE. SARA, THAT'S A GOOD POINT.\nACKMAN MADE A HAT TIP TO ICAHN. IF YOU BOUGHT WITH CARL AT THAT\nTIME, YOU DID WELL. IF YOU SOLD WITH HIM NOW YOU\nWOULD DO WELL. I THINK ICAHN BOUGHT IN THE LOW\n30s AND MORE RECENTLY NORTH OF 60.\nFAIR POINT THERE. >> GREAT STORY.\nINTERESTING WRINKLE WE WILL WATCH THIS.\nKATE KELLY AT 30 ROCK. CARL ICAHN IS BACK AT DELIVERING\nALPHA THIS YEAR ALONG WITH OTHER TITANS INCLUDING JACK LEW AND\nPAUL SINGER WHO HAS BEEN MAKING NEWS THE PAST COUPLE WEEKS THAT\nA TAKES PLACE ON SEPTEMBER 13th. >> YESTERDAY WE SAW THE DOLLAR\nSTORES TAKING A HIT.

WITH THAT SAID, THE RISK REALLY\nSTILL IS TO THE DOWNSIDE. I'LL EXPLAIN WHY.\nIF SHE IS IN ANY WAY HAWKISH, OBVIOUSLY, WE'RE GOING TO SEE\nTHE VIX MOVE UP AND STOCKS WILL PROBABLY MOVE DOWN.\nHOW MUCH DEPENDS ON EXACTLY HOW HAWKISH SHE SOUNDS.\nHAD EARS THE PROBLEM. THE REAL WORRY IS IF SHE\nACTUALLY ENDS UP SAYING NOTHING ABOUT NEAR TERM PATH, TALKING\nABOUT THE FED TOOL KIT AND WHAT THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO USE IN THE\nFUTURE. IN THE EVENT OF SAYING NOTHING,\nTHE MARKET WILL BELIEVE THAT SEPTEMBER IS ESSENTIALLY OFF OF\nTHE TABLE. IF THAT HAPPENS, THE VIX COULD\nGO LOWER FROM HERE AND THE PROBLEM IS IF YOU'RE A BULL ON\nTHE STOCK MARKET MOST FEEL THERE WOULD ONLY BE MODEST UPSIDE\nBECAUSE WE'RE AT NEW HIGHS. THE RISK IS TO THE DOWNSIDE\nULTIMATELY IN THAT WHAT SHE SAYS, IF IT'S ANYWHERE HAWKISH,\nWOULD DEFINITELY MOVE THE MARKET MORE THAN IF SHE SIMPLY AVOIDS\nTHE TOPIC ALTOGETHER. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE VIX AND THE\nVIX, OF COURSE, EVERYBODY HAS BEEN COMPLAINING ABOUT IT BUT\nREMEMBER AUGUST IS TRADITIONALLY A MONTH WHERE NOT A LOT OF\nHAPPENS. VIX LOOKS OUT 30 DAYS.\nWE KEEP EMPHASIZING YOU DON'T LOOK AT THE VIX HERE.\nYOU LOOK AT THE VIX FUTURES. YOU WANT TO LOOK AT THE OCTOBER,\nTHE NOVEMBER, THE DECEMBER FUTURES CONTRACTS.\nHERE YOU'RE OUT 17 AN 18, UP 50, 60% FROM WHERE THE VIX IS RIGHT\nNOW. OBVIOUSLY THE ELECTION IS A\nMAJOR ISSUE. OBVIOUSLY ANY CONCERNS ABOUT THE\nFED. THOSE ARE ALREADY BEING\nREFLECTED HERE IN THE VIX FUTURES.\nTHE MARKET IS ANTICIPATING MORE VOLATILITY MOVING FORWARD.\nNOW, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE AN EXPERT IN PATTERN RECOGNITION TO\nFIGURE OUT WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON BY AND LARGE.\nNOT ONLY IS THE S&P 500 FLAT OR THE DOW BUT THE BROADEST MEASURE\nOF THE STOCK MARKET THAT I USE WHICH IS THE RUSSELL 3,000, HAS\nBEEN FLAT FOR THE MONTH. THIS IS A BIG COMPLAINT FOR\nEVERYBODY BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS, THAT THERE'S BEEN\nSECTOR ROTATION THAT'S BEEN GOING ON.\nSO MY TAKE ON THIS IS THE MARKET HAS REALLY BEEN VERY, VERY\nHEALTHY OVERALL BECAUSE NUMBER ONE, WE HAVE A VERY CLEAR MARKET\nLEADER THAT HAS EMERGED THIS QUARTER SINCE EARNINGS AND THAT\nIS TECHNOLOGY STOCKS. SO THAT LEADERSHIP TA WE'VE SEEN\nFROM TECHNOLOGY IS IMPACT. BANKS, WHICH HAD A NICE START\nAND THEN FELL BACK AGAIN ON RATE CONCERNS, HAD BEEN IMPROVING\nRECENTLY, AS HAVE MATERIALS, PARTLY, THIS IS ON THE WEAKER\nDOLLAR, BUT THERE'S ANOTHER SORT OF SUBGROUP SHOWING REAL\nIMPROVEMENT. INDUSTRIALS, WE'VE SEEN DEERE,\nILLINOIS TOOL WORKS, DOVER, THE BIG GLOBAL INDUSTRIALS ALL OUT\nPERFORMING. WHAT'S NOT PERFORMING?\nTHE DEFENSIVE NAMES, UTILITIES AND TELECOM STOCKS FOR THE MOST\nPART ARE DOWN 2 TO 4%. THIS IS CLASSIC ROTATION.\nOUT OF DEFENSE INTO CYCLICAL IF YOU WANT BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IT\nSHOWS NO SIGN OF DETERIORATION IN THE MARKET.\nAND THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO HEAR WHERE YELLEN FEELS ABOUT THINGS\nRIGHT NOW. THE DOW UP 79 POINTS.\nBACK TO YOU. >> THANK YOU.\nLET'S SEE HOW THE BOND MARKET IS SET UP FOR JANET YELLEN'S SPEECH\nLATER THIS MORNING. JUST ABOUT 20 MINUTES.\nRICK SANTELLI AT THE CME GROUP IN CHICAGO.\nGOOD MORNING, RICK. >> GOOD MORNING.\nSARA, MUCH OF THE SAME DYNAMIC IN THE LAST 48 HOURS, YOU KNOW,\nTHE SHORT END IS SOMEWHAT HOT, YOU CAN SEE ON A TWO-DAY OF 2\nYEAR BUT IF YOU WANT TO SEE WHY IT'S HOTTER, THESE ARE THE\nHIGHEST YIELD CLOSES RIGHT UNDER 80 GOING BACK TO 6-6-16.\nTRIPLE SIXES. SEE THE TWO-YEAR NOTE RATHER\nAGGRESSIVE. WITH A TIGHTER TIME FRAME\nINSTEAD OF JUNE, LET'S GO BACK TO AUGUST 1st.\nYOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THE LONG END OF THE CURVE IS NOT AS HOT,\nHENCE YOUR FLATTENING DYNAMIC. THESE ALL START ON THE 1st OF\nAUGUST. 10-YEAR AND THEN A TIGHT RANGE,\nLOOK AT THE RIGHT SIDE COMPARED TO THE RIGHT SIDE ON THAT\nTWO-YEAR. THE 30-YEAR, THE RIGHT SIDE\nDROPS EVEN MORE. WHAT'S VERY SIMILAR TO THE\n30-YEAR WHICH HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT BUOYANT IS WHAT'S GOING ON WITH\nTHE DOLLAR INDEX. IT'S DOWN ABOUT A FIFTH OF A\nCENT TODAY BUT THAT CHART SHOWS THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THE\nMARKET THAT LOOKING FOR THE HAWKISH COMMENTS TO BE DELIVERED\nON. THEY COULD BE TALKED ABOUT BUT\nIT'S WHETHER THEY ARE ACTUALLY DELIVERED ON.\nPEOPLE DOWN HERE HAVE A DIFFERENT SYNOPSIS AND THINK THE\nHYPOTHESIS IS WRONG. IS THERE NO RISK TO WAITING?\nTHAT'S WHERE THE ARGUMENT IS. THE YIELD CURVE, 10s MINUS 2s,\nTHAT'S A ONE-YEAR CHART BUT THE MONEY BALL TRADE ON FLATTENING\nIS 30s MINUS 5s. WE TALKED ABOUT IT MANY TIMES.\nFLAT SINCE EARLY MARCH OF 2015 MAKING FRESH FLATS AS WE SPEAK.\nCARL, BACK TO YOU. >> ALL RIGHT.\nRICK DON'T GO FAR AWAY. RICK SANTELLI.\nWHEN WE COME BACK FORMER FED GOVERNOR FREDERICK MISH CAN WILL\nREACT TO THE SPEECH, THAT BIG EVENT SET TO BEGIN AT THE TOP OF\nTHE HOUR.

THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THE\nFACT THAT HEALTH CARE HAS BEEN AT THE CENTER OF THE STORM.\nIT'S BEEN ALMOST A YEAR SINCE POLITICIANS STARTED COMING OUT\nAGAINST HEALTH CARE. WE ACTUALLY THINK FOR THE\nINTREPID AND FOR THE BRAVE THIS MAY BE A TIME TO LOOK AT HEALTH\nCARE ON THE LONG SIDE BECAUSE YOU ARE AT A VALUATION DISCOUNT\nTHAT BASICALLY ALREADY REFLECTS A DECENT PROBLEMABILITY OF\nREGULATION NEXT YEAR. THIS IS THE KIND OF DISCOUNT\nTHAT WE'VE ONLY SEEN A COUPLE OF TIMES IN THE LAST 25 YEARS, BUT\nOVERALL THE MARKET IS NOT FULLY REFLECTING THE RISKS OUT THERE.\n>> YOU AND I NEED TO GET A COCKTAIL.\n>> HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON THAT DEBATE A LITTLE BIT.\n>> OR COFFEE. >> AND THEN YOU WOULD BOTH BE\nWRONG. >> WE'RE NOT WRONG.\n>> LIKE YOUR COMMENTARY THERE.",

ON TRACK FOR 2016, THE\nREDEMPTIONS IN HEDGE FUNDS, TO BE LARGER THAN IT WAS IN 2009.\nTHAT'S RIGHT DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS.\nLET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE CHART HERE.\nTHIS IS A CHART OF THE MOST SHORTED STOCKS IN BLUE AND THE\nS&P 500 IN ORANGE. AND YOU CAN SEE SINCE JULY,\nTHAT'S WHEN ALL THOSE REDEMPTIONS STARTED, YOU'VE HAD\nTHIS MASSIVE RALLY, BUT 14% COMPARED TO THE S&P 500 WHICH IS\nUP 7%. NOW WHY DOES THIS SPELL TROUBLE?\nNOT RIGHT NOW BUT WHEN THE MARKET SELLS OFF AGAIN, BECAUSE\nIT'S HEDGE FUND REDEMPTION. THEY ARE OUT OF THE MARKET.\nTHERE WON'T BE AS MANY SHORTS OUT THERE TO BUY WHEN THE MARKET\nDROPS DOWN. SO THERE WILL BE LESS LIQUIDITY\nSO IF WE DO GET A SELLOFF LIKE JULIEN IS TALKING ABOUT THEN YOU\nMAY NOT HAVE THE BUY THE DIP MENTALITY AGAIN.\nTHE MONEY MAY NOT THEREBY. >> LET ME JUST PUSH ON THAT,\nB.K. >> HAVE MONEY COMING OUT OF THE\nHEDGE FUNDS AND I ACCEPT THAT AS A GIVEN.\nTO THE EXTENT THESE ARE BIG PENSION FUN THAT HAVE A NUT THAT\nTHEY NEED TO MEET THEY WILL GO INTO ETFs OR SOMETHING ELSE.\nTHAT MONEY IS GOING BACK INTO THE MARKET.\nNOT GOING AWAY. >> NOT NECESSARILY.\n>> WHERE IS IT GOING? >> I UNDERSTAND --\n>> COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE, COULD BE GOING BACK INTO THAT.\nCOULD BE GOING INTO BONDS. IT COULD BE GOING INTO SEVERAL\nDIFFERENT AREAS. WE GET A MINOR UPTICK IN\nINTEREST RATES IT WILL GO RIGHT BACK INTO BONDS.\nBIG PENSION FUNDS NEED MORE THAN WHAT THE MARKET IS GIVING RIGHT\nNOW AND EVEN IF IT'S MARJ AZ-ZOHOUR NAL, RIGHT, 10% OR 20%\nTHAT'S NOT GOING BACK INTO THE MARKET, THAT'S STILL FEWER\nBUYERS OUT THERE WHEN THE MARKET SELLS OFF\n>> YOU THINK THEY WANT -- IF YOU THINK THEY NEED MORE THOUGH THEY\nWON'T GO INTO BONDS. >> THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT ISSUES.\nDO YOU PUT YOUR EQUITY EXPOSURE IN A HEDGE FUND OR DO YOU PUT IT\nIN SOMETHING OTHER THAN A HEDGE FUND, AN ETF, FOR EXAMPLE?\nTHAT'S NOT A WHOLESALE CHANGE OF THE MIX TO TRY TO GET TO WHERE\nTHEY NEED TO GET TO. >> BUT THERE IS A WHOLESALE\nCHANGE IN THE MIX GOING ON AT PENSION FUNDS.\nTHEY ARE LOOKING FOR LARGER RETURNS, SO THEY ARE LOOKING\nTOWARDS COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE? >> AND B.K.'S POINT, CORRECT ME\nIF I'M WRONG, IF THE MARKET DOES BEGIN TO SELL OFF, THE IMPLIED\nUNDERLYING BID TO THE TAPE, GIVEN THE FACT THAT THERE WOULD\nBE A HIGHER SHORT COMPONENT OF THE HEDGE FUNDS IS NOT GOING TO\nBE THERE, AND ADD ON TO THAT THE OPTIONS MARKET, THERE IS\nABSOLUTELY NO PROTECTION. THERE'S NOBODY REALLY BUYING\nPROTECTION BECAUSE IT'S BEEN SUCH AN ABSOLUTE DRAG ON\nPERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, IT COULD EVEN\nEXACERBATE LOWER AND YOU CAN SEE IT PULL BACK IN THE MARKET A LOT\nDEEPER THAN PEOPLE MAY BE PREPARED FOR, AND I THINK THAT'S\nWHAT HIS SBLOINT. >> AND WHAT I WOULD SAY ABOUT\nTHE EQUITY ALLOCATION IS IF YOU PULL IT OUT AND PUT IT BACK INTO\nAN ETF OR LONG ONLY FUND YOU'VE DONE THAT WHILE THEY REDEMPTION\nHAS BEEN GOING ON.

WE'RE, OF COURSE, RELIEVED THAT\nHE WILL NOT BE HEARING CRIMINAL CASES, BUT THIS IS ONLY\nTEMPORARY. JUDGES IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY\nROTATE THEIR ASSIGNMENTS EVERY YEAR AND HE CAN COME BACK TO\nCRIMINAL COURT ANY TIME HE CHOOSES.\nFURTHERMORE, A BIAS JUDGE WHO DOES NOT UNDERSTAND SEXUAL\nHARASSMENT AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE IS JUST AS DANGEROUS IN CIVIL\nCOURT AS IN CRIMINAL COURT BECAUSE MANY CASES, FOR EXAMPLE,\nTHE BILL COSBY TYPE LITIGATION. WOMEN SUING FOR SEXUAL\nHARASSMENT OR SEXUAL ASSAULT ARE HURT IN CIVIL COURT.\nSO WE BELIEVE THAT HE NEEDS TO BE REMOVED FROM THE BENCH AND\nWE'RE PROCEEDING AHEAD WITH THE RECALL.\n>> WHY DO YOU THINK HE DID THIS? IF YOU ARE MAKING THIS ARGUMENT\nTHAT, HEY, CIVIL COURT YOU CAN DO AS MUCH DAMAGE IN CIVIL COURT\nAS YOU CAN IN CRIMINAL COURT IF PEOPLE PERCEIVE YOU TO BE BIAS.\nWHY DO YOU THINK HE MADE THIS CHANGE?\n>> I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY MYSTERY HERE.\nWE HAVE BEEN VERY ENGAGED IN DOING VERY THOROUGH RESEARCH\nINTO HIS RECORD AND BRINGING THAT RECORD FORWARD AND SHARING\nIT WITH VOTERS SO THEY CAN VOTE ON AN INFORMED BASIS ON HIS\nRECORD. I'M SURE AS THOSE VERY\nDISTURBING FACTS HAVE COME FORWARD ABOUT HIS RECORD AND\nDOMESTIC VIOLENCE, AS WELL AS SEX CRIMES.\nHE IS NOT ENJOYING THAT PUBLICITY.\nBUT WE FEEL THE VOTERS HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW THIS INFORMATION.\n>> SO, MICHELLE, THERE ARE THOSE IN THE LEGAL COMMUNITY WHO LAW\nJUDGE PERSKY AND SAY HE'S VERY FAIR.\nHE'S GOT A LONG AND ESTEEMED RECORD AND THAT IT ISN'T FAIR TO\nPICK ONE OR TWO CASES WITH DETAILS THAT PERHAPS ARE\nMISSING. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE PEOPLE\nWHO STAND BY JUDGE PERSKY WHO ARE WITHIN HIS INDUSTRY WHO SAY\nHE'S NOT AS BAD AS PEOPLE MAKE HIM OUT TO BE.\n>> IT ISN'T A MATTER OF ONE OR TWO CASES.\nIN FACT, THIS JUDGE HAS A LONG HISTORY OF JUDICIAL BIAS IN\nCASES INVOLVING SEX CRIMES AND VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN.\nSOME, AT LEAST ONE OF THESE CASES WAS WHILE HE WAS\nPREVIOUSLY IN CIVIL COURT AND THAT INVOLVED A 17-YEAR-OLD GIRL\nWHO ALLEGED THAT SHE WAS GANG RAPED BY MEMBERS OF A COLLEGE\nBASEBALL TEAM AND JUDGE PERSKY ALLOWED THE DEFENDANTS TO ENTER\nREVEALING PHOTOGRAPHS OF HER AT A PARTY MORE THAN A YEAR AFTER\nTHE ASSAULT INTO EVIDENCE. IT WAS VERY PREJUDICIAL.\nSUPPOSEDLY TO SHOW THAT SHE DIDN'T HAVE POST-TRAUMATIC\nSTRESS DISORDER BECAUSE SHE WAS HAVING FUN AT A PARTY.\nWHAT I WOULD SAY TO PEOPLE WHO ARE, YOU KNOW, SUPPORTING HIM IS\nTHAT THIS IS A DEMOCRACY. THEY HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO SUPPORT\nTHE CANDIDATE OF THEIR CHOICE. WE FEEL THAT WHEN HIS FULL\nRECORD IS BEFORE THE VOTERS OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY, THEY WILL\nSELECT ANOTHER CANDIDATE. >> ONE OTHER QUICK QUESTION FOR\nYOU, IT DIDN'T GO ON OUR TEAM THAT WE HAVE ON OUR CALENDAR ONE\nWEEK TODAY BROCK TURNER IS OUT. WE'RE HEADING INTO LABOR DAY\nWEEKEND AND HE'S HEADING OUT OF SUMMER JAIL.\nONLY TWO MONTHS OUT OF A SIX-MONTH SENTENCE.\nAND I KNOW THAT REALLY IRKS YOU NOT ONLY PROFESSIONALLY, BUT\nPERSONALLY. WHAT DO YOU HAVE PLANNED?\n>> WE ARE GOING TO BE HAVING A RALLY AT 10:00 A.M. ON SEPTEMBER\n2nd DOWN IN FRONT OF THE JAIL. WE WILL HAVE MANY SPEAKERS.\nONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S HAPPENED AS HIS RECORD HAS COME\nFORWARD IS THAT MANY ELECTED OFFICIALS HAVE STARTED TO\nENDORSE THE RECALL, SUCH AS THE MAYOR OF PALO ALTO AND MEMBERS\nOF CONGRESS AND OTHER ELECTIVES WILL BE THERE, AS WELL AS TWO\nSURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. WE ARE GOING TO BE THERE SAYING\nENOUGH IS ENOUGH. WOMEN DESERVE JUSTICE AND WE ARE\nNOT GOING TO BE SATISFIED UNTIL HE IS NO LONGER A JUDGE IN OUR\nCOUNTY. >> WHAT ABOUT BROCK TURNER, IS\nTHERE AN EFFORT TO FOLLOW HIM IN HIS ENDEAVORS AS HE BECOMES A\nFREE PERSON TRYING TO PUT HIS LIFE BACK TOGETHER?\n>> WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE ENGAGED IN THAT.\nI MEAN, I THINK THAT THIS SENTENCE WAS, YOU KNOW,\nRIDICULOUSLY SHORT AND I HOPE THAT HE WILL NOT REOFFEND AS A\nRESULT OF HAVING NOT BEEN HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR HIS ACTIONS.\nBUT THAT IS, OF COURSE, A CONCERN.\nTHAT WHEN SOMEONE IS NOT HELD ACCOUNTABLE THAT THEY MAY NOT\nHAVE LEARNED THE RIGHT LESSON. UNFORTUNATELY, ALL HE SEEMS TO\nHAVE APOLOGIZED FOR IS DRINKING. HE DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE TAKEN\nRESPONSIBILITY FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SHOULD NOT, IN MY\nOPINION, BE RELEASED AT THIS POINT.\n>> BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF HE FOLLOWS THROUGH ON THE\nSTATEMENTS THAT HE MADE IN COURT TO TRY TO MAKE GOOD ON SOME OF\nTHE WRONGS THAT HE BELIEVES HE'S COMMITTED ONCE HE'S OUT.\nPROFESSOR DARBER, THANKS VERY MUCH FOR BEING WITH US TODAY AND\nWE'LL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE STORY.\nTHANK YOU.",

IN NEW YORK, OFFICIALS MAKE A\nMAJOR DRUG BUST, SEIZING MORE THAN 65 POUNDS OF HEROIN HIDDEN\nIN A TRUCK AXLE. CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT DEB\nFEYERICK.

WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS A KNOCKOFF.\nA SYNTHETIC OPOID BEING MADE IN MEXICO AND CHINA ACCORDING TO\nFEDERAL SOURCES. AUTHORITIES BELIEVE IT IS\nRESPONSIBLE FOR THIS OVERDOSE OUTBREAK.\nIN OHIO, MORE THAN 90 PEOPLE OVERDOSING SINCE THE WEEKEND.\nTHERE WERE MULTIPLE FATALITIES. THE OVERDOSE OUTBREAK ALSO IN\nFLORIDA, INDIANA AS WELL. THE BOTTOM LINE IS MONEY.\nDRUG DEALERS ARE BUYING PURE HEROIN AND THEY ARE DIVIDING IT,\nMIXING IT, AND ADDING THIS INGREDIENT.\nWHICH IS MUCH STRONGER AND MUCH MORE POTENT.\nTHE GUYS WHO ARE MIXING THIS ARE NOT CHEMISTS SO YOU'RE GETTING A\nVERY LETHAL DOSE. YOU THINK OF CARFENTONLE, TWO\nMILLIGRAMS CAN KNOCK OUT A 2,000 POUND ELEPHANT.\nTHE REASON POLICE BELIEVE IT'S IN CLUSTERS IS BECAUSE DEALERS\nHAVE AREAS THEY SELL TO. YOU'RE SELLING THE SAME TAINTED\nNARCOTIC TO MULTIPLE PEOPLE. THEY MAY BE USING IT IN SHOOTING\nGALLERIES, THESE HOUSES THEY GO TO IN ORDER TO SHOOT THIS, BUT\nTHEY'RE ALL REACTING THE VERY SAME WAY.\nIN ONE COUNTY IN WEST VIRGINIA, THEY CALLED IT BASICALLY AN\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY RAN OUT OF EMERGENCY\nVEHICLES, AMBULANCES, AND THE DEA IS NOW INVESTIGATING THESE\nFATAL OVERDOSES NOT AS SIMPLY A HEALTH OVERDOSE, THEY'RE\nINVESTIGATING IT AS A HOMICIDE. THERE'S A NEW CHARGE CALLED\nDEATH RESULTING.

BUT YES, IF WE RECEIVE MEDICAL\nINFORMATION ABOUT THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, I THINK\nTHAT WOULD BE OF GENUINE INTEREST TO --\n>> WELL, JULIAN, LET'S BE DIRECT.\nHAVE YOU RECEIVED INFORMATION ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S MEDICAL\nCONDITION? WHATEVER IT IS.\n>> I KNOW YOU GUYS WOULD LOVE IT IF WE SCOOPED OURSELVES ON \"FOX\n& FRIENDS.\" BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO.\nWE HAVE ALREADY PUBLISHED 32,000 -- MORE THAN THAT NOW\nHILLARY CLINTON E-MAILS. YOU CAN SEARCH THEM.\nA LOT OF STORIES HAVE COME OUT ABOUT THAT.\nTHERE ARE PASSING REFERENCES TO HILLARY CLINTON'S HEAD INJURY.\nSHE CALLS IT I HAVE A CRACKED HEAD, TO DECISION FATIGUE.\nTO HER LOOKING UP -- AND [ INDISCERNIBLE ] AND TAKING AN\nALERTNESS DRUG. NOT TO SAY SHE HAS SOME\nNECESSARILY SERIOUS DISORDER. ANYONE IN A HIGH STRESS JOB LIKE\nMILITARY PILOTS LIKE TO TAKE THIS.\nSO I THINK IT'S PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE TO REVEAL SERIOUS\nINFORMATION ABOUT A CANDIDATE. IN FACT, THEY SHOULD DISCLOSE IT\nTHEMSELVES, THE INFORMATION THAT MIGHT AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO DO\nTHE JOB. >> JULIAN, WHAT IS THE MOST\nSHOCKING THING THAT YOU HAVE FOUND ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON?\n>> WELL, I THINK THE MOST INTERESTING AND SERIOUS RELATE\nTO UPCOMING PUBLICATIONS WE HAVE.\nA VARIETY OF DIFFERENT TYPES. SO A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT WE\nHAVE ALREADY PUBLISHED. I MEAN, IT MAY NOT BE THAT\nAPPARENT TO MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT SORT OF SPECIALIZING IN\nPOLITICS AND NATIONAL SECURITY, BUT MAJOR FAILURE BY THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN AND THE BERNIE SANDERS CAMPAIGN, HILLARY CLINTON TRIED\nTO RUN ON HER HAVING JUDGMENT AND EXPERIENCE IN THE STATE\nDEPARTMENT. LATER ON THOSE CAMPAIGNS -- TOO\nLATE IN THE PROCESS IN MY VIEW STARTED PICKING UP THE\nEXPERIENCE WAS MOSTLY A BAD EXPERIENCE.\nSO FOR EXAMPLE IN LIBYA. WE PUBLISHED 1,700 E-MAILS ABOUT\nHER INVOLVEMENT IN LIBYA. AND BENGHAZI IS A SMALL PART OF\nTHAT. BUT SHE WAS THE LEADING\nARCHITECT, THE LEADING POLITICAL FORCE DRIVING TO DESTROY THE\nLIBYAN -- AND THE PENTAGON WAS -- SENIOR GENERALS, GENERALS\nIN THE PENTAGON, NOT ALL OF THEM BUT A NUMBER, WERE PUSHING\nSTRONGLY THE LIBYAN STATE SHOULD NOT BE DESTROYED BECAUSE RADICAL\nJIHADI GROUPS WOULD MOVE IN AND TAKE IT OVER WHICH THEY DID.\nIT'S NOW A FAILED STATE OF ISIS, ET CETERA.\n>> RIGHT. >> SHE WAS THE LEADING CAUSE OF\nTHIS. WE'VE PUBLISHED SOME THINGS FROM\nHER E-MAIL CALLED THE LIBYA TICK TOCK.\nTHAT'S HER INTERNAL BRAG SHEET OF HOW SHE WAS THE PERSON BEHIND\nTHE LIBYAN CATASTROPHE. IT WAS PRODUCED IN LATE 20011.\nBEFORE ISIS HAD MOVED IN. >> WE HAVE ABOUT 90 SECONDS.\nI WANT TO COME BACK -- WE HAVE SOME VIEWER QUESTIONS FOR YOU,\nJULIAN. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US THIS\nMORNING, HOWEVER I DO NOTICE ONE THING.\nYOU DON'T SAY ANYTHING BAD ABOUT THE RUSSIANS.\nTHEY GAVE YOU YOUR OWN TV SHOW. HAVE THEY INTIMIDATED YOU?\n>> IT'S JUST FALSE. FALSE INFORMATION.\nA LOT OF -- THERE'S NOW A CAMPAIGN UNDER WAY.\nBECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON, HER CAMP AND THOSE WHO SUPPORT HER\nFOR GOOD REASONS AND BAD KNOW THAT WE HAVE SERIOUS UPCOMING\nPUBLICATIONS. SO SINCE THE DNC LEAKS THERE'S\nBEEN A CAMPAIGN AGAINST WIKILEAKS BECAUSE THEY'RE\nWORRIED ABOUT ANY PUBLICATION. WE HAVE A PERFECT RECORD OVER A\nDECADE OF HAVING NEVER GOT IT WRONG WITH WHAT WE PUBLISHED SO\nTHEY CAN'T THE SUBSTANCE. THEY CAN'T ATTACK THE EVIDENCE\nWE HAVE PRODUCED. THEY CAN'T ATTACK OUR ANALYSIS,\nSO INSTEAD THEY TRY AND ATTACK US AD HOMINUM.\nTHAT IS FALSE. I NEVER HAD A JOB WITH RUSSIA.\nSO -- SO WE HAVE PUBLISHED 650,000 DOCUMENTS ABOUT RUSSIA\nOR PUTIN, MOST OF THEM CRITICAL. MORE THAN 2.3 MILLION ABOUT\nSYRIA AND BASHAR AL ASSAD. >> ALL RIGHT.\n>> -- PERSONAL E-MAILS. SO THIS IS COMPLETE GARBAGE.\n>> ALL RIGHT.

THAT LEAK FORCED DNC NATIONAL\nCOMMITTEE CHAIR DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ TO STEP DOWN.\nAND NOW ASSANGE IS THREATENING AN OCTOBER SURPRISE FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON, PROMISING TO RELEASE DOCUMENTS THAT COULD AFFECT THE\nELECTION. WATCH.\n>> IT'S A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF DOCUMENTS FROM\nDIFFERENT TYPES OF INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE\nELECTION CAMPAIGN. SOME QUITE UNEXPECTED ANGLES\nTHAT ARE -- THEY'RE QUITE INTERESTING.\n>> Reporter: ASSANGE IS PROMISING TO RELEASE THE\nDOCUMENTS BEFORE THE ELECTION NOT SO MUCH TO DROP A BOMBSHELL\nAT THE PERFECT MOMENT, BUT TO FULLY VET THE DOCUMENTS SO THEY\nCANNOT BE EASILY DISMISSED. MEGYN.\n>> TRACE, THANK YOU. NOW PART TWO OF OUR EXCLUSIVE\nINTERVIEW WITH JULIAN ASSANGE. WE PICK UP OUR DISCUSSION ON THE\nFALLOUT FROM WIKILEAKS' RELEASE OF THOSE LEAKED DNC E-MAILS.\n>> ARE YOU RECEIVING MORE LEAKS NOW IN THE WAKE OF WHAT WE SAW,\nYOU KNOW, HERE IN THE U.S. ELECTION IN JULY?\n>> YES. EVERY TIME WE HAVE A BIG\nPUBLICATION, AND THEY SEE THIS AND GO, OH, OKAY.\nWIKILEAKS WORKS. I'LL GIVE THEM MY THOUGHTS.\nSO SUBSEQUENTLY, UNFORTUNATELY, IT MEANS THAT WE'RE DROWNING,\nHAVING TO WORK AROUND THE CLOCK. >> THERE WAS A LOT OF\nSPECULATION HERE IN THE UNITED STATES THAT PERHAPS RUSSIA WAS\nBEHIND THE HACK OF THE DNC. I KNOW YOU'RE NOT GIVING UP YOUR\nSOURCE. BUT THERE WAS ALSO SPECULATION\nABOUT WHETHER YOUR SOURCE WAS INSIDE THE DNC AND WHETHER IT\nMAY HAVE POTENTIALLY BEEN A MAN NAMED SETH RICH, WHO WAS KILLED.\nHE WAS SHOT IN WHAT POLICE INITIALLY SAID LOOKED LIKE A\nROBBERY JUST LAST MONTH. YOU CAME OUT IN AN INTERVIEW\nWITH DUTCH TELEVISION AND MENTIONED SETH RICH IN A\nDISCUSSION ABOUT WHISTLE-BLOWERS AND THE NEED TO PROTECT THEM.\nAND WIKILEAKS, IN FACT, OFFERED $20,000 FOR INFORMATION LEADING\nTO THE ARREST OF SETH RICH'S KILLER.\nWHY ARE YOU SO INTERESTED IN SETH RICH'S KILLER?\n>> WE'RE VERY INTERESTED IN ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE A THREAT\nTO ALLEGED WIKILEAKS SOURCES. THE POLICE HAVE OFFERED $25,000.\nWE HAVE OFFERED $20,000. WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT SETH'S\nDEATH NECESSARILY IS CONNECTED TO OUR PUBLICATION.\nTHAT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE ESTABLISHED.\nBUT IF THERE'S ANY QUESTION ABOUT A SOURCE AT WIKILEAKS\nBEING THREATENED, THEN PEOPLE CAN BE ASSURED THAT THIS\nORGANIZATION WILL GO AFTER ANYONE WHO MAY HAVE BEEN\nINVOLVED IN SOME KIND OF ATTEMPT TO COERCE OR POSSIBLY, IN THIS\nCASE, KILL A POTENTIAL SOURCE. >> DO YOU HAVE ANY SUSPICIONS ON\nWHO MAY HAVE BEEN BEHIND HIS MURDER?\n>> WE HAVE RECEIVED A VARIETY OF INFORMATION.\nWE'LL BE REPORTING THAT INFORMATION TO THE POLICE.\nI DON'T THINK THE INFORMATION SO FAR IS ENOUGH TO START POINTING\nANY DIRECT FINGERS. WE DON'T WANT TO COMPROMISE THE\nPOLICE INVESTIGATION. >> I'M TRYING TO READ YOU,\nJULIAN. I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO REVEAL\nYOUR SOURCE, BUT IT CERTAINLY SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE SUGGESTING A\nMAN WHO LEAKED INFORMATION TO WIKILEAKS WAS THEN MURDERED.\n>> IF THERE'S SOMEONE WHO'S POTENTIALLY CONNECTED TO OUR\nPUBLICATION AND THAT PERSON IS THEN MURDERED IN SUSPICIOUS\nCIRCUMSTANCES, IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE TWO\nARE CONNECTED. BUT IT IS A VERY SERIOUS MATTER.\nTHAT TYPE OF ALLEGATION IS VERY SERIOUS, AND IT'S TAKEN VERY\nSERIOUSLY BY US. >> I WANT TO ASK YOU BECAUSE\nTHERE'S A BIG A.P. REPORT TODAY SAYING WIKILEAKS RELEASES THE\nPRIVATE OF INNOCENTS. >> IT'S A NONSENSE REPORT.\nIT'S BY A SINGLE JOURNALIST, WHO HAS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST.\nHAVE A LOOK AT HIM ON TWITTER. HE'S BEEN CAMPAIGNING AGAINST US\nEVER SINCE THIS DNC LEAK. >> I GOT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE\nU.S. ELECTION. AS YOU POINT OUT, YOU'RE NOT AN\nAMERICAN CITIZEN. YOU'RE AN AUSTRALIAN.\nYOU'RE CLEARLY NOT ROOTING FOR HILLARY.\nARE YOU ROOTING FOR TRUMP? >> NO.\nIF WE HAVE GOOD INFORMATION ON TRUMP, WE PUBLISH THAT.\nIF WE HAVE GOOD INFORMATION ON DEMOCRATS, WE PUBLISH THAT.\nI WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT NO ORGANIZATION, NO MEDIA\nORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES WOULD NOT HAVE PUBLISHED\nTHE DNC E-MAILS. BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE\nACTUALLY. I THINK MSNBC WOULDN'T HAVE\nPUBLISHED THEM. I THINK \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\"\nWOULDN'T HAVE PUBLISHED MOST OF THEM.\nAND THAT'S SAD. IT'S AN INCREDIBLE\nPOLITICIZATION IN THIS ELECTION OF THE MEDIA, AND IT IS A BIT\nCONCERNING THE ALLEGATIONS BY THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN, THAT\nEVERYONE IS A RUSSIAN AGENT, ARE REALLY DISTURBING.\nWHY IS THAT? WELL, BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON,\nTHE DEMOCRAT, HAS POSITIONED HERSELF TO BE THE SECURITY\nCANDIDATE. SHE'S POWERED -- AND SHE'S\nGRABBED ON TO THIS KIND OF HYSTERIA ABOUT RUSSIA AND IS\nUSING THAT TO DEMONIZE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.\nAS FAR AS WE CAN SEE, BEING RUSSIAN AGENTS IS NOT ONE OF\nTHEM. SOME PEOPLE HAVE ASKED US WHEN\nWE RELEASE INFORMATION ON DONALD TRUMP, AND OF COURSE WE'RE VERY\nINTERESTED. ACTUALLY IT'S REALLY HARD FOR US\nTO RELEASE ANYTHING WORSE THAN WHAT COMES OUT OF DONALD TRUMP'S\nMOUTH EVERY SECOND DAY. IT'S PART OF HIS CHARISMATIC\nAPPEAL THAT HE SPEAKS OFF THE CUFF.\nBUT, YOU KNOW, THAT'S DIFFICULT FOR DONALD TRUMP TO OVERCOME A\nLOT OF THOSE THINGS EVEN WITH A LOT OF GREAT MATERIAL COMING OUT\nBY WIKILEAKS OR OTHER  >> YOU DON'T DO THE HACKING.\nYOU JUST DO THE RELEASING. THERE HAVE BEEN SOME LEAKS ABOUT\nOUR MILITARY, INCLUDING ONE BACK IN 2007 THAT WAS CONTROVERSIAL.\nYOU GUYS RELEASED VIDEO OF AN APACHE HELICOPTER IN BAGHDAD AND\nSURE ENOUGH, THE UNITED STATES HAD KILLED TWO REUTERS\nPHOTOGRAPHERS AND SOME CHILDREN WERE INJURED.\nAND WIKILEAKS, YOU KNOW, WE SAW THAT THANKS TO VIDEOS THAT YOU\nGUYS RELEASED. BUT THE MILITARY CAME OUT LATER\nAND SAID, IT DOESN'T SHOW THE FULL CONTEXT.\nTHEY SAY RPGs WERE FOUND. GROUND TROOPS LEADER DISCOVERED\nA LAUNCHER, A RIFLE WHERE THIS GROUP HAD BEEN CLUSTERED.\n>> LOOK, WE HAVE A CLEAR RESULT. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAD TO ADMIT\nIN COURT, UNDER OATH, THAT NOT A SINGLE PERSON THAT IT COULD FIND\nHAD BEEN HARMED AS A RESULT. >> DO YOU NEED TO BE MORE\nCAREFUL? WHAT SAY YOU TO THE CHARGE THAT\nTHESE RELEASES NEED TO BE SCREENED BETTER BY WIKILEAKS IF\nYOU'RE GOING TO DO IT AT ALL? >> WELL, LET'S BACK STEP.\nWHAT EXACTLY IS THE ALLEGATION HERE?\nTHE ALLEGATION IS THAT WIKILEAKS IS PUBLISHING TOO MUCH TRUE\nINFORMATION. >> BUT PRIVATE.\nPRIVATE, CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.\n>> WE PUBLISH A LOT OF INFORMATION, AND HAVE HAD A\nPERFECT RECORD SO FAR. >> JULIAN ASSANGE, THE MAN WHO\nMAY HOLD THE OCTOBER SURPRISE OR PERHAPS SEPTEMBER.\nWE'LL HAVE TO WAIT TO FIND OUT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING\nHERE. >> THANK YOU, MEGYN.\n>> WELL, YOU JUST HEARD JULIAN ASSANGE TALK ABOUT THE MYSTERY\nBEHIND THE MURDER OF DNC SATISFIER SETH RICH.\nTHIS JUST HAPPENED ON JULY 9th. SO WE DID SOME DIGGING ON THE\nCASE, AND WE WILL SHOW YOU WHAT WE FOUND RIGHT AFTER THIS BREAK.\nDON'T GO AWAY.",

TRACE GALLAGHER IS BACK WITH\nMORE ON THIS UNSOLVED CASE. TRACE?\n>> Reporter: MEGYN, SETH RICH HAD BEEN WORKING FOR THE\nDEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR TWO YEARS AND HELPED DEVELOP\nA COMPUTER PROGRAM TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO FIND\nPOLLING PLACES ON ELECTION DAY. JUST DAYS BEFORE HE DIED, RICH\nHAD BEEN CHOSEN TO WORK ON HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN.\nJULIAN ASSANGE HAS NEVER INDICATED THAT SETH RICH PLAYED\nANY PART IN SLIPPING DNC DOCUMENTS TO WIKILEAKS, BUT AS\nYOU HEARD, ASSANGE HAS MENTIONED RICH'S NAME WHEN TALKING ABOUT\nTHE RISK THAT WIKILEAKS' SOURCES TAKE.\nJUST OVER A MONTH AGO ON JULY 10th, SETH RICH WAS GUNNED DOWN\nAT 4:00 IN THE MORNING NEAR HIS HOME OUTSIDE OF D.C.\nIN THE HOURS BEFORE THE SHOOTING, RICH WAS SEEN DRINKING\nAT A BAR AND HEADING TO AN AFTER-HOURS CLUB.\n19 MINUTES BEFORE HE WAS SHOT, RICH WAS ON THE PHONE WITH HIS\nGIRLFRIEND. POLICE SAY THEY HAVE NO\nSUSPECTS, WITNESSES, OR MOTIVE, THOUGH THEY ARE LOOKING AT\nATTEMPTED ROBBERY, EVEN THOUGH HIS WATCH, WALLET, AND CREDIT\nCARDS WERE NOT TAKEN. TWO WEEKS AGO, D.C. METROPOLITAN\nPOLICE SAID THERE WAS NO INDICATION THAT SETH RICH'S\nDEATH WAS CONNECTED TO HIS EMPLOYMENT AT THE DNC, AND\nSOURCES INVOLVED WITH THE DNC LEAK INVESTIGATION TOLD NEWS\nWEEK THAT RICH HAD BEEN RULED OUT AS HAVING ANY PART IN THE\nHACK AND, INSTEAD, THE FOCUS WAS ON A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT, NAMELY\nTHE RUSSIANS. NEIGHBORS OF SETH RICH SAY THEY\nHAD LONG BEEN COMPLAINING ABOUT A SURGE IN NEIGHBORHOOD CRIME.\nMEGYN. >> TRACE, GOOD TO SEE YOU.\n>> JOINING ME NOW, MARK THIESSEN, FORMER CHIEF\nSPEECHWRITER TO PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH.\nYOU KNOW, THE QUESTION -- I WANT TO GET TO WIKILEAKS IN A SECOND,\nBUT THE QUESTION REMAINS IF SETH RICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT,\nEITHER AND DIDN'T LEAK TO WIKILEAKS AND WASN'T THINKING\nABOUT LEAKING TO WIKILEAKS, WHY IS JULIAN ASSANGE SO INTERESTED\nIN HIS MURDER? >> BECAUSE JULIAN ASSANGE IS A\nMEGALO MEIN YAK WHO WANTS TO ASSOCIATE HIMSELF WITH ANYTHING\nTHAT MAKES NEWS. HE'S A CRIMINAL.\nHE'S RELEASED THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS AND HUNDREDS OF\nTHOUSANDS OF UNREDACTED CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS.\nHE LOVES BEING IN THE MEDIA. HE LOVES BEING IN THE SPOTLIGHT.\nSO IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME AT ALL THAT HE WOULD TRY AND\nASSOCIATE HIMSELF WITH THIS AND MAKE A STORY OUT OF IT.\n>> SO HE'S TRYING TO STOKE THE FIRE THERE AND HAVE PEOPLE JUMP\nTO THE CONCLUSION THAT THIS WAS MORE THAN A NEIGHBORHOOD\nROBBERY? >> IT SEEMS THAT WAY.\nAGAIN, WE DON'T KNOW. MAYBE THERE IS SOMETHING TO IT,\nBUT WE DON'T KNOW THE ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS.\nBUT IF THERE ISN'T ANYTHING TO IT, IT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME THAT\nJULIAN ASSANGE WILL STILL TRY AND STOKE THE FIRE.\n>> THE D.C. PLACE HAVE SAID AT THIS POINT THERE'S NO INDICATION\nTHAT SETH'S DEATH IS CONNECTED TO HIS EMPLOYMENT AT THE DNC,\nHOWEVER WE WELCOME INFORMATION TO COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO THE\nIDENTIFICATION OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE.\nJULIAN SAYS OVER AND OVER, WE'VE NEVER BEEN WRONG.\nYOU KNOW, EVERYTHING WE'VE RELEASED HAS BEEN -- WE'VE NEVER\nGOTTEN IT WRONG IN TEN YEARS. THAT'S NOT THE COMPLETE STORY.\n>> NO, IT'S NOT THE COMPLETE STORY.\nWHAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW, WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THE\nDEMOCRATS AND HILLARY CLINTON ARE EXPERIENCING SOMETHING --\nTHERE'S A WORD FOR IT. IT'S CALLED BLOWBACK.\nSO ASSANGE IS A CRIMINAL. HE'S DAMAGED NATIONAL SECURITY,\nRELEASED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF UNREDACTED CLASSIFY DOCUMENTS\nTHAT HAVE HARMED NATIONAL SECURITY, AND THE OBAMA\nADMINISTRATION DURING THE COURSE OF ITS ENTIRETY HAS DONE\nABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT IT. >> THEY OPENED UP A CRIMINAL\nINVESTIGATION ON HIM. >> BUT THEY HAVEN'T INDICTED HIM\nAS FAR AS WE KNOW. IN FACT, THEY SAID ACCORDING TO\nTHE WASHINGTON POST, THEY REPORTED THAT THEY WERE NOT\nGOING TO BE ABLE TO ENDIET HIM BECAUSE THEY'D HAVE TO INDICT\nEVERY NEWSPAPER AND EVERY JOURNALIST.\nASSANGE ISN'T A JOURNALIST. ALL THESE PAPERS HAVE REPORTED\nHIS INFORMATION SAY HE'S NOT A JOURNALIST.\nHE'S AN ACTIVIST. WHAT HE DOES, WHICH IS DIFFERENT\nFROM JOURNALISM, IS THAT HE RELEASES ALL THESE DOCUMENTS\nUNCLASSIFIED. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, HE RELEASED\n76,000 PAGES OF CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS WHICH EXPOSED THE\nIDENTITIES OF 100 AFGHANS WHO WERE INFORMING ON THE TALIBAN.\n\"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" REFUSED TO LINK TO HIM AND REFUSED TO\nPUBLISH THOSE NAMES. JULIAN ASSANGE PUT THOSE NAMES\nOUT THERE. AGAIN, THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION\nDID NOTHING ABOUT IT. >> I ACTUALLY ASKED HIM ABOUT\nSOME OF THAT, AND WE'LL AIR THAT IN AN EXTENDED INTERVIEW.\nWE'RE OUT OF TIME.

MEGYN.\n>> TRACE, THANK YOU. NOW PART TWO OF OUR EXCLUSIVE\nINTERVIEW WITH JULIAN ASSANGE. WE PICK UP OUR DISCUSSION ON THE\nFALLOUT FROM WIKILEAKS' RELEASE OF THOSE LEAKED DNC E-MAILS.\n>> ARE YOU RECEIVING MORE LEAKS NOW IN THE WAKE OF WHAT WE SAW,\nYOU KNOW, HERE IN THE U.S. ELECTION IN JULY?\n>> YES. EVERY TIME WE HAVE A BIG\nPUBLICATION, AND THEY SEE THIS AND GO, OH, OKAY.\nWIKILEAKS WORKS. I'LL GIVE THEM MY THOUGHTS.\nSO SUBSEQUENTLY, UNFORTUNATELY, IT MEANS THAT WE'RE DROWNING,\nHAVING TO WORK AROUND THE CLOCK. >> THERE WAS A LOT OF\nSPECULATION HERE IN THE UNITED STATES THAT PERHAPS RUSSIA WAS\nBEHIND THE HACK OF THE DNC. I KNOW YOU'RE NOT GIVING UP YOUR\nSOURCE. BUT THERE WAS ALSO SPECULATION\nABOUT WHETHER YOUR SOURCE WAS INSIDE THE DNC AND WHETHER IT\nMAY HAVE POTENTIALLY BEEN A MAN NAMED SETH RICH, WHO WAS KILLED.\nHE WAS SHOT IN WHAT POLICE INITIALLY SAID LOOKED LIKE A\nROBBERY JUST LAST MONTH. YOU CAME OUT IN AN INTERVIEW\nWITH DUTCH TELEVISION AND MENTIONED SETH RICH IN A\nDISCUSSION ABOUT WHISTLE-BLOWERS AND THE NEED TO PROTECT THEM.\nAND WIKILEAKS, IN FACT, OFFERED $20,000 FOR INFORMATION LEADING\nTO THE ARREST OF SETH RICH'S KILLER.\nWHY ARE YOU SO INTERESTED IN SETH RICH'S KILLER?\n>> WE'RE VERY INTERESTED IN ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE A THREAT\nTO ALLEGED WIKILEAKS SOURCES. THE POLICE HAVE OFFERED $25,000.\nWE HAVE OFFERED $20,000. WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT SETH'S\nDEATH NECESSARILY IS CONNECTED TO OUR PUBLICATION.\nTHAT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE ESTABLISHED.\nBUT IF THERE'S ANY QUESTION ABOUT A SOURCE AT WIKILEAKS\nBEING THREATENED, THEN PEOPLE CAN BE ASSURED THAT THIS\nORGANIZATION WILL GO AFTER ANYONE WHO MAY HAVE BEEN\nINVOLVED IN SOME KIND OF ATTEMPT TO COERCE OR POSSIBLY, IN THIS\nCASE, KILL A POTENTIAL SOURCE. >> DO YOU HAVE ANY SUSPICIONS ON\nWHO MAY HAVE BEEN BEHIND HIS MURDER?\n>> WE HAVE RECEIVED A VARIETY OF INFORMATION.\nWE'LL BE REPORTING THAT INFORMATION TO THE POLICE.\nI DON'T THINK THE INFORMATION SO FAR IS ENOUGH TO START POINTING\nANY DIRECT FINGERS. WE DON'T WANT TO COMPROMISE THE\nPOLICE INVESTIGATION. >> I'M TRYING TO READ YOU,\nJULIAN. I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO REVEAL\nYOUR SOURCE, BUT IT CERTAINLY SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE SUGGESTING A\nMAN WHO LEAKED INFORMATION TO WIKILEAKS WAS THEN MURDERED.\n>> IF THERE'S SOMEONE WHO'S POTENTIALLY CONNECTED TO OUR\nPUBLICATION AND THAT PERSON IS THEN MURDERED IN SUSPICIOUS\nCIRCUMSTANCES, IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE TWO\nARE CONNECTED. BUT IT IS A VERY SERIOUS MATTER.\nTHAT TYPE OF ALLEGATION IS VERY SERIOUS, AND IT'S TAKEN VERY\nSERIOUSLY BY US. >> I WANT TO ASK YOU BECAUSE\nTHERE'S A BIG A.P. REPORT TODAY SAYING WIKILEAKS RELEASES THE\nPRIVATE OF INNOCENTS. >> IT'S A NONSENSE REPORT.\nIT'S BY A SINGLE JOURNALIST, WHO HAS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST.\nHAVE A LOOK AT HIM ON TWITTER. HE'S BEEN CAMPAIGNING AGAINST US\nEVER SINCE THIS DNC LEAK. >> I GOT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE\nU.S. ELECTION. AS YOU POINT OUT, YOU'RE NOT AN\nAMERICAN CITIZEN. YOU'RE AN AUSTRALIAN.\nYOU'RE CLEARLY NOT ROOTING FOR HILLARY.\nARE YOU ROOTING FOR TRUMP? >> NO.\nIF WE HAVE GOOD INFORMATION ON TRUMP, WE PUBLISH THAT.\nIF WE HAVE GOOD INFORMATION ON DEMOCRATS, WE PUBLISH THAT.\nI WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT NO ORGANIZATION, NO MEDIA\nORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES WOULD NOT HAVE PUBLISHED\nTHE DNC E-MAILS. BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE\nACTUALLY. I THINK MSNBC WOULDN'T HAVE\nPUBLISHED THEM. I THINK \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\"\nWOULDN'T HAVE PUBLISHED MOST OF THEM.\nAND THAT'S SAD. IT'S AN INCREDIBLE\nPOLITICIZATION IN THIS ELECTION OF THE MEDIA, AND IT IS A BIT\nCONCERNING THE ALLEGATIONS BY THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN, THAT\nEVERYONE IS A RUSSIAN AGENT, ARE REALLY DISTURBING.\nWHY IS THAT? WELL, BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON,\nTHE DEMOCRAT, HAS POSITIONED HERSELF TO BE THE SECURITY\nCANDIDATE. SHE'S POWERED -- AND SHE'S\nGRABBED ON TO THIS KIND OF HYSTERIA ABOUT RUSSIA AND IS\nUSING THAT TO DEMONIZE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.\nAS FAR AS WE CAN SEE, BEING RUSSIAN AGENTS IS NOT ONE OF\nTHEM. SOME PEOPLE HAVE ASKED US WHEN\nWE RELEASE INFORMATION ON DONALD TRUMP, AND OF COURSE WE'RE VERY\nINTERESTED. ACTUALLY IT'S REALLY HARD FOR US\nTO RELEASE ANYTHING WORSE THAN WHAT COMES OUT OF DONALD TRUMP'S\nMOUTH EVERY SECOND DAY. IT'S PART OF HIS CHARISMATIC\nAPPEAL THAT HE SPEAKS OFF THE CUFF.\nBUT, YOU KNOW, THAT'S DIFFICULT FOR DONALD TRUMP TO OVERCOME A\nLOT OF THOSE THINGS EVEN WITH A LOT OF GREAT MATERIAL COMING OUT\nBY WIKILEAKS OR OTHER  >> YOU DON'T DO THE HACKING.\nYOU JUST DO THE RELEASING. THERE HAVE BEEN SOME LEAKS ABOUT\nOUR MILITARY, INCLUDING ONE BACK IN 2007 THAT WAS CONTROVERSIAL.\nYOU GUYS RELEASED VIDEO OF AN APACHE HELICOPTER IN BAGHDAD AND\nSURE ENOUGH, THE UNITED STATES HAD KILLED TWO REUTERS\nPHOTOGRAPHERS AND SOME CHILDREN WERE INJURED.\nAND WIKILEAKS, YOU KNOW, WE SAW THAT THANKS TO VIDEOS THAT YOU\nGUYS RELEASED. BUT THE MILITARY CAME OUT LATER\nAND SAID, IT DOESN'T SHOW THE FULL CONTEXT.\nTHEY SAY RPGs WERE FOUND. GROUND TROOPS LEADER DISCOVERED\nA LAUNCHER, A RIFLE WHERE THIS GROUP HAD BEEN CLUSTERED.\n>> LOOK, WE HAVE A CLEAR RESULT. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAD TO ADMIT\nIN COURT, UNDER OATH, THAT NOT A SINGLE PERSON THAT IT COULD FIND\nHAD BEEN HARMED AS A RESULT. >> DO YOU NEED TO BE MORE\nCAREFUL? WHAT SAY YOU TO THE CHARGE THAT\nTHESE RELEASES NEED TO BE SCREENED BETTER BY WIKILEAKS IF\nYOU'RE GOING TO DO IT AT ALL? >> WELL, LET'S BACK STEP.\nWHAT EXACTLY IS THE ALLEGATION HERE?\nTHE ALLEGATION IS THAT WIKILEAKS IS PUBLISHING TOO MUCH TRUE\nINFORMATION. >> BUT PRIVATE.\nPRIVATE, CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.\n>> WE PUBLISH A LOT OF INFORMATION, AND HAVE HAD A\nPERFECT RECORD SO FAR. >> JULIAN ASSANGE, THE MAN WHO\nMAY HOLD THE OCTOBER SURPRISE OR PERHAPS SEPTEMBER.\nWE'LL HAVE TO WAIT TO FIND OUT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING\nHERE. >> THANK YOU, MEGYN.\n>> WELL, YOU JUST HEARD JULIAN ASSANGE TALK ABOUT THE MYSTERY\nBEHIND THE MURDER OF DNC SATISFIER SETH RICH.\nTHIS JUST HAPPENED ON JULY 9th. SO WE DID SOME DIGGING ON THE\nCASE, AND WE WILL SHOW YOU WHAT WE FOUND RIGHT AFTER THIS BREAK.\nDON'T GO AWAY.",

TRACE GALLAGHER IS BACK WITH\nMORE ON THIS UNSOLVED CASE. TRACE?\n>> Reporter: MEGYN, SETH RICH HAD BEEN WORKING FOR THE\nDEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR TWO YEARS AND HELPED DEVELOP\nA COMPUTER PROGRAM TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO FIND\nPOLLING PLACES ON ELECTION DAY. JUST DAYS BEFORE HE DIED, RICH\nHAD BEEN CHOSEN TO WORK ON HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN.\nJULIAN ASSANGE HAS NEVER INDICATED THAT SETH RICH PLAYED\nANY PART IN SLIPPING DNC DOCUMENTS TO WIKILEAKS, BUT AS\nYOU HEARD, ASSANGE HAS MENTIONED RICH'S NAME WHEN TALKING ABOUT\nTHE RISK THAT WIKILEAKS' SOURCES TAKE.\nJUST OVER A MONTH AGO ON JULY 10th, SETH RICH WAS GUNNED DOWN\nAT 4:00 IN THE MORNING NEAR HIS HOME OUTSIDE OF D.C.\nIN THE HOURS BEFORE THE SHOOTING, RICH WAS SEEN DRINKING\nAT A BAR AND HEADING TO AN AFTER-HOURS CLUB.\n19 MINUTES BEFORE HE WAS SHOT, RICH WAS ON THE PHONE WITH HIS\nGIRLFRIEND. POLICE SAY THEY HAVE NO\nSUSPECTS, WITNESSES, OR MOTIVE, THOUGH THEY ARE LOOKING AT\nATTEMPTED ROBBERY, EVEN THOUGH HIS WATCH, WALLET, AND CREDIT\nCARDS WERE NOT TAKEN. TWO WEEKS AGO, D.C. METROPOLITAN\nPOLICE SAID THERE WAS NO INDICATION THAT SETH RICH'S\nDEATH WAS CONNECTED TO HIS EMPLOYMENT AT THE DNC, AND\nSOURCES INVOLVED WITH THE DNC LEAK INVESTIGATION TOLD NEWS\nWEEK THAT RICH HAD BEEN RULED OUT AS HAVING ANY PART IN THE\nHACK AND, INSTEAD, THE FOCUS WAS ON A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT, NAMELY\nTHE RUSSIANS. NEIGHBORS OF SETH RICH SAY THEY\nHAD LONG BEEN COMPLAINING ABOUT A SURGE IN NEIGHBORHOOD CRIME.\nMEGYN. >> TRACE, GOOD TO SEE YOU.\n>> JOINING ME NOW, MARK THIESSEN, FORMER CHIEF\nSPEECHWRITER TO PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH.\nYOU KNOW, THE QUESTION -- I WANT TO GET TO WIKILEAKS IN A SECOND,\nBUT THE QUESTION REMAINS IF SETH RICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT,\nEITHER AND DIDN'T LEAK TO WIKILEAKS AND WASN'T THINKING\nABOUT LEAKING TO WIKILEAKS, WHY IS JULIAN ASSANGE SO INTERESTED\nIN HIS MURDER? >> BECAUSE JULIAN ASSANGE IS A\nMEGALO MEIN YAK WHO WANTS TO ASSOCIATE HIMSELF WITH ANYTHING\nTHAT MAKES NEWS. HE'S A CRIMINAL.\nHE'S RELEASED THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS AND HUNDREDS OF\nTHOUSANDS OF UNREDACTED CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS.\nHE LOVES BEING IN THE MEDIA. HE LOVES BEING IN THE SPOTLIGHT.\nSO IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME AT ALL THAT HE WOULD TRY AND\nASSOCIATE HIMSELF WITH THIS AND MAKE A STORY OUT OF IT.\n>> SO HE'S TRYING TO STOKE THE FIRE THERE AND HAVE PEOPLE JUMP\nTO THE CONCLUSION THAT THIS WAS MORE THAN A NEIGHBORHOOD\nROBBERY? >> IT SEEMS THAT WAY.\nAGAIN, WE DON'T KNOW. MAYBE THERE IS SOMETHING TO IT,\nBUT WE DON'T KNOW THE ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS.\nBUT IF THERE ISN'T ANYTHING TO IT, IT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME THAT\nJULIAN ASSANGE WILL STILL TRY AND STOKE THE FIRE.\n>> THE D.C. PLACE HAVE SAID AT THIS POINT THERE'S NO INDICATION\nTHAT SETH'S DEATH IS CONNECTED TO HIS EMPLOYMENT AT THE DNC,\nHOWEVER WE WELCOME INFORMATION TO COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO THE\nIDENTIFICATION OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE.\nJULIAN SAYS OVER AND OVER, WE'VE NEVER BEEN WRONG.\nYOU KNOW, EVERYTHING WE'VE RELEASED HAS BEEN -- WE'VE NEVER\nGOTTEN IT WRONG IN TEN YEARS. THAT'S NOT THE COMPLETE STORY.\n>> NO, IT'S NOT THE COMPLETE STORY.\nWHAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW, WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THE\nDEMOCRATS AND HILLARY CLINTON ARE EXPERIENCING SOMETHING --\nTHERE'S A WORD FOR IT. IT'S CALLED BLOWBACK.\nSO ASSANGE IS A CRIMINAL. HE'S DAMAGED NATIONAL SECURITY,\nRELEASED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF UNREDACTED CLASSIFY DOCUMENTS\nTHAT HAVE HARMED NATIONAL SECURITY, AND THE OBAMA\nADMINISTRATION DURING THE COURSE OF ITS ENTIRETY HAS DONE\nABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT IT. >> THEY OPENED UP A CRIMINAL\nINVESTIGATION ON HIM. >> BUT THEY HAVEN'T INDICTED HIM\nAS FAR AS WE KNOW. IN FACT, THEY SAID ACCORDING TO\nTHE WASHINGTON POST, THEY REPORTED THAT THEY WERE NOT\nGOING TO BE ABLE TO ENDIET HIM BECAUSE THEY'D HAVE TO INDICT\nEVERY NEWSPAPER AND EVERY JOURNALIST.\nASSANGE ISN'T A JOURNALIST. ALL THESE PAPERS HAVE REPORTED\nHIS INFORMATION SAY HE'S NOT A JOURNALIST.\nHE'S AN ACTIVIST. WHAT HE DOES, WHICH IS DIFFERENT\nFROM JOURNALISM, IS THAT HE RELEASES ALL THESE DOCUMENTS\nUNCLASSIFIED. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, HE RELEASED\n76,000 PAGES OF CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS WHICH EXPOSED THE\nIDENTITIES OF 100 AFGHANS WHO WERE INFORMING ON THE TALIBAN.\n\"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" REFUSED TO LINK TO HIM AND REFUSED TO\nPUBLISH THOSE NAMES. JULIAN ASSANGE PUT THOSE NAMES\nOUT THERE. AGAIN, THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION\nDID NOTHING ABOUT IT. >> I ACTUALLY ASKED HIM ABOUT\nSOME OF THAT, AND WE'LL AIR THAT IN AN EXTENDED INTERVIEW.\nWE'RE OUT OF TIME. IT'S A TIGHT SHOW TONIGHT.\nMARK, GREAT TO SEE YOU. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.\n>> THANKS, MEGYN.",

LAST NIGHT, JULIAN ASSANGE WENT\nON MEGYN KELLY'S SHOW AND SAID HE WOULD BE LEAKING MORE STUFF\nREGARDING HILLARY CLINTON AND SOME OF IT MIGHT BE REALLY\nENTERTAINING. >> ARE WE GOING TO SEE IT BEFORE\nTHE NOVEMBER 8th ELECTION? >> YES, ABSOLUTELY.\nPEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO UNDERSTAND WHO IT IS THAT\nTHEY'RE NOMINATING. IT'S A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT\nTYPES OF DOCUMENTS FROM DIFFERENT TYPES OF INSTITUTIONS\nASSOCIATED WITH THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN.\nSOME QUITE UNEXPECTED ANGLES THAT ARE QUITE INTERESTING, SOME\nEVEN ENTERTAINING. >> I CAN HARDLY WAIT.\nAS THIS IS HAPPENING, HACKERS POSTED NAKED PICTURES OF LESLIE\nJONES, CAUSING OUTRAGE. SO WHY ARE HACKS OKAY IN SOME\nCASES BUT NOT IN OTHERS? THEY'RE BOTH INTRUSIONS.\nARE SUCH EXPOSURES ONLY ACCEPTABLE WHEN IT BENEFITS YOU,\nHURTS AN ADVERSARY OR SATISFIES YOUR MORBID CURIOSITY.\nCLINTON IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, SO WHAT IF THERE IS\nSOMETHING IN THE LEAKS THAT EXPOSES ILLEGAL ACTIVITY.\nREMEMBER, IF JULIAN ASSANGE HAD YOUR PERSONAL INFO, MEDICAL\nRECORDS, FINANCIALS OR A HOME MOVIE YOU MADE WITH SOME\nHITCHHIKERS IN THE '80s, HE WOULD PUBLIC THEM IN THE NAME OF\nASSANGE. IT'S THE WORK OF A MAN WHO LOVES\nTO SEE HIS NAME IN PRINT, EVEN IF IT MEANS SOILING THE NAMES OF\nOTHERS. SINCE WHEN DID HE CARE ABOUT\nAMERICA? ASSANGE'S LEAKS HAVE JUST ONE\nTHING IN COMMON, IT'S NOT PRINCIPLE, IT'S AVAILABILITY,\nWHATEVER HE CAN GET HIS HANDS ON OR WHAT'S HANDED TO HIM.\nMEANING YOU COULD BE NEXT. OR WORSE, ME.\nTHIS IS ALL A SELF-SERVING MONOLOGUE, BRIAN.\n>> YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO YOU.\nI KNOW YOU, YOU PROBABLY HAVE FIVE E-MAIL ACCOUNTS, ALL THE\nPASSWORDS ARE NAMED AFTER YOUR KIDS OR DOGS.\nI COULD PROBABLY HACK YOUR ACCOUNT IN TEN MINUTES.\n>> WHAT IS YOUR FIRST NAME? WE'RE NEVER ON TOGETHER.\nFIRST OFF, I'M WITH YOU. IF YOU WANT TO GET TO THE\nTRUTH -- I HOPE WE CAN GET THE FBI TO DO THAT.\nCAN YOU DO AN INVESTIGATION? I DO NOT WANT TO HAIL HIM\nBECAUSE HE MIGHT BE PURSUING DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.\nI HAD REINCE PRIEBUS ON THE RADIO TO ME, AND HE SAID, I'M\nNOT HAPPY ABOUT THIS. I DON'T WANT THE OCTOBER\nSURPRISE TO COME FROM JULIAN ASSANGE.\n>> EXACTLY. >> THAT'S A MATURE POSITION.\n>> HE DOESN'T CARE, HE'S NOT A REPUBLICAN.\nHE JUST LIKES TO DISRUPT. THAT'S BASICALLY IT.\n>> MEGYN ASKED HIM ABOUT THIS, AND HE SAID LISTEN, I THINK\nPEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW. THEY SHOULD KNOW WHO THEY'RE\nVOTING FOR AND THEY SHOULD KNOW THE TRUTH.\nHE SAID HE DOESN'T WANT TO TELL EXACTLY OBVIOUSLY WHAT IT IS,\nBUT HE THINKS IT'S SIGNIFICANT AND MADE THE POINT THAT YOU'RE\nGOING TO HAVE TO SEE IF THE MEDIA PICKS UP ON IT.\nNEVERTHELESS, YEAH, I AGREE. THIS IS THE SAME THING, YOU\nKNOW, AS EDWARD SNOWDEN. SO IT'S THE SAME PRINCIPLES.\nIT'S INTRUSIVE. IT VIOLATES PRIVACY.\nWE DON'T WANT THE RUSSIANS HACKING US.\nWE DON'T WANT THE CHINESE OR THE NORTH KOREANS AND YOU DON'T WANT\nJULIAN ASSANGE GETTING AHOLD OF IT.\n>> DANA, WE ARE KIND OF GUILTY AS HUMAN BEINGS, BECAUSE WE ARE\nCURIOUS ABOUT PEOPLE'S INNER LIVES.\nWE DON'T CARE ABOUT WHAT THEY DO OUTSIDE.\nBUT WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING AT HOME OR WHAT THEY'RE\nTHINKING. SO WE WANT TO READ IT.\n>> IT'S LIKE IRRESISTIBLE. YOU WOULD NEVER WANT IT FOR\nYOURSELF, BUT THAT'S WHY PEOPLE BUY NATIONAL ENQUIRER.\nI'M NOT FOR THE LEAKS. PRESS SECRETARIES ARE NEVER THE\nLEAKER. PART TWO OF THAT INTERVIEW AIRS\nTONIGHT. REMEMBER A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO,\nASSANGE ALLUDED TO THE DNC STAFFER WHO WAS BASICALLY\nMURDERED IN WASHINGTON, D.C. AND APPARENTLY SHE TALKED TO HIM\nABOUT THAT. WE'LL FIND OUT TONIGHT MORE\nABOUT IT. >> JUAN, ANYTHING IN YOUR\nE-MAILS THAT YOU WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND GO, OH,\nMY GOD. >> IT'S OVER.",

              "text": "I WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN.\n>> KASIE HUNT, YOU WERE THERE. TELL US MORE ABOUT IT.\nIT WAS AN INCREDIBLE SPEECH. BLISTERING TO SAY THE LEAST.\n>> THERE WAS A POINT IN THE SPEECH WHERE SHE FOCUSED ON PART\nOF THE REASON WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS.\nSHE READ THROUGH A LIST OF HEADLINES THAT THEY PUBLISHED\nRECENTLY TO GASPS IN THE ROOM. AND I DO THINK ONE THING THAT'S\nIMPORTANT TO NOTE ABOUT HERE FROM A POLITICAL PERSPECTIVE, IS\nTHAT THIS SPEECH WAS REALLY ABOUT REPUBLICANS.\nTHERE WERE MOMENTS IN THE SPEECH WHEN SHE TALKED ABOUT HOW THIS\nIS THE POINT WHERE YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE PARTY OF\nLINCOLN AND THE PARTY OF TRUMP. WE DON'T OFTEN HEAR CLINTONS\nTALK IN A POSITIVE WAY ABOUT REPUBLICANS.\nTHE THINGS THAT I'M OUTLINING TODAY, THEY ARE NOT REPUBLICAN.\nTHEY ARE NOT CONSERVATIVE. THIS IS A WHOLE OTHER THING\nWE'RE GRAPPLING WITH. THERE IS A STATEMENT THAT LANDED\nIN MY E-MAIL INBOX AFTERWARD FROM ONE OF THESE GROUPS AND THE\nFIRST THING SHE SAID, WE DON'T THINK IT WAS A MEMBER OF THE\nALT-RIGHT BUT THEN WENT ON TO OUTLINE HOW THEY DEFINE THE\nALTERNATIVE RIGHT AND ONE OF THE LINES IN THE STATEMENT SAYS THAT\nTHERE IS VERY BROAD OVERLAP BETWEEN THE RACES, BUT THEY\nDIFFER IN AVERAGE LEVELS OF INTELLIGENCE AND OTHER TRAITS.\nTHAT IS THE ALT-RIGHT. >> I THINK THAT THE PROBLEM IS\nWHY I FELT MRS. CLINTON'S SPEECH YESTERDAY WAS SO IMPORTANT IS\nTHAT SOMEONE WHO HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN CIVIL RIGHTS ALL MY\nLIFE IT IS FRIGHTENING THAT WE NOW SEE AND MIKE HAS BROUGHT\nTHIS UP. THE MAIN STREAMING OF THE MOST\nHATEFUL KIND OF CHARACTER S AND MESSAGES IN THIS COUNTRY.\nI FEAR FOR WHERE THIS COULD GO. AND I THINK THAT WE CAN SEE\nPEOPLE GET LEGITIMACY THAT ARE REALLY ON THE FRINGE THAT HAVE\nCOME WITH THE MOST BIGOTED, RACIST, HATEFUL, HOMPHOBIC STUFF\nWHICH IS WHY SHE WAS RIGHT TO APPEAL.\n>> THIS IS BEYOND PARTY AND FRIGHTENING AND DANGEROUS.\nYOU KNOW, FOR CALLING ON REPUBLICAN LEADERS TO COME CLEAN\nAND HAVE A SPINE AND DO WHAT'S RIGHT, EVEN THOUGH IT COSTS\nTHEM. I THINK WE HAVE TO ALSO NOT\nMINCE WORDS AND NOT BE AFRAID AT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN.\nNOT BE AFRAID OF SOUNDING SHRILL OR GETTING TWEETED AT.\nWE HAVE TO SAY WHAT WE SEE. WE'RE ANALYSTS.\nWE'RE SUPPOSED TO PROGNOSTICATE AND TRANSLATE AND COVER.\nAND THIS IS WRONG WHAT'S HAPPENING.\nRAY SUAREZ, HOW DO WE PUT INTO PERSPECTIVE WITHOUT LOSING A\nSENSE OF OBJECTIVITY AND COVERING THIS ELECTION AND HOW\nDO WE GIVE A SENSE OR PERSPECTIVE AS TO WHERE, AT\nLEAST ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, WHERE THIS RACE HAS GONE.\n>> WELL, YOU HAVE TO DO IS \"WHAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY SAY.\"\nPART OF THE POWER OF LAST NIGHT'S SPEECH, AND IT WILL BE\nINTERESTING TO SEE IF IT HAS ANY LEGS GOING FORWARD IS THAT SHE\nDIDN'T INDULGE IN HIPRBLY AND IT IS HARD IF THERE IS NO SMOKE TO\nGIVE A SPEECH ABOUT FIRE. SHE GAVE A LONG SPEECH ABOUT\nFIRE AND THEN GAVE YOU PICTURES OF IT.\nWHEN DONALD TRUMP TWEETS OUT, FOR INSTANCE, \"THE FACT\" THAT\nALMOST ALL THE WHITE MURDER VICTIMS IN AMERICA AND THERE IS\nALMOST NO BLOW BACK AFTER IT TURNS OUT TO BE SOURCED FROM A\nHARD RIGHT SITE. SOURCED FROM A RACIST SITE.\nTHIS WAS JUST A QUESTION OF TIME UNTIL IT WOULD BE A CRITICAL\nMASS OF THESE POINTS. AND THEN SHE READ THE LITANY\nLAST NIGHT. >> SHE DESCRIBED IT.\nAND WE JUST HAD, WHILE YOU WERE SPEAKING, ONE OF HER QUOTES THAT\nWHAT DONALD TRUMP IS DOING IS SINISTER.\nIS THAT FAIR? IS THAT TRUE?\n>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT SINISTER. I'M STUNNED IF ANYONE ACTUALLY\nCLOSE TO HIM RAN A CAMPAIGN BEFORE THINKS THIS IS GOING TO\nWORK. THE OLD BAG OF TRICKS IS TO KEEP\nPEOPLE LIKE BANNON ON YOUR SIDE, BUT AT ONE OR TWO ARMS LENGTH\nREMOVED. SO, YOU CAN GET HIS CREEPY\nENERGY, BUT ALSO HAVE PLAUSIBLE DE\nDENIABLY. TO MAKE A CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN IS\nSOMETHING OF A TOTALLY DIFFERENT ORDER.\n>> MIKE BARNICLE. >> BEN, I WANT TO ASK YOU\nSOMETHING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF.\nWHEN YOU WATCH HIM, WHEN YOU COVER HIM, DO YOU GET THE\nIMPRESSION THAT WE'RE WATCHING SOMEONE?\nHERE'S WHERE I'M COMING FROM. WE'RE TRYING TO DECIPHER WHAT WE\nSAY DONALD TRUMP THINKS BECAUSE I DON'T THINK HE THINKS, I THINK\nHE JUST REACTS TO THINGS. I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE,\nTHAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. THAT'S WHAT WE SEE IN EACH AND\nEVERY DAY. DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT\nASSESSMENT? >> I THINK HE IS VERY REACTIVE\nAND HE LOOKS AT WHAT IS IN FRONT OF HIM AND RESPONDS TO IT.\nI WANT TO SOUND A LITTLE BIT CONTRARRIAN NOTE TO WHAT YOU ALL\nHAVE BEEN SAYING THIS MORNING. MUCH OF WHAT I AGREE WITH.\nHILLARY CLINTON NEEDS TO BE CAREFUL HERE.\nTHERE IS PLENTY OF MATERIAL THAT TRUMP HIMSELF HAS GIVEN YOU THAT\nYOU CAN WORK WITH WHEN YOU'RE MAKING THIS CASE.\nTHE HARDER CASE TO BE MADE IS TO SAY THAT TRUMP IS JUST LIKE ALEX\nJONES. THAT HE IS JUST LIKE A BREITBART COMMENTER.\nWHO VIEW HIM IN POSITIVE TERMS BECAUSE OF HIS ECONOMIC MESSAGE.\nWHAT IS GOING ON HERE IS WINNING THE WHITE SUBURBANITES AND\nKEEPING THEM OPEN TO THE IDEA. THE MORE HE BECOMES UNACCEPTABLE\nTO THEM, THE MORE HILLARY CLINTON CAN WIN OVER THE\nSUBURBANITES THAT HAD GONE FOR MITT ROMNEY LAST TIME AROUND.\nYOU SEE CANDIDATES LIKE ROB PORTMAN RUNNING 13 POINTS AHEAD\nOF TRUMP IN OHIO BECAUSE HE'S STILL WINNING THOSE VOTERS AND\nAS LONG AS THOSE VOTERS ARE CLOSED OFF TO TRUMP, I THINK\nHE'S GOING TO HAVE A VERY HARD TIME.\n>> WE'LL GO MEACHAM TO KASIE TO GENE.\nDURING A RALLY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, HE PREEMPTIVELY CALLED HER\nSPEECH, ONE OF THE MOST BRAZEN ATTEMPTS AT DISTRACTION IN THE\nHISTORY OF POLITICS. >> IT'S A MOVEMENT, FOLKS.\nLIKE THEY'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. AND DON'T ACCUSE DECENT\nAMERICANS WHO SUPPORT THIS CAMPAIGN, YOUR CAMPAIGN OF BEING\nRACISTS, WHICH WE'RE NOT. IT'S THE OLDEST PLAY IN THE\nDEMOCRATIC PLAYBOOK. WHEN DEMOCRATIC POLICIES FAIL,\nTHEY ARE LEFT WITH ONLY THIS ONE TIRED ARGUMENT.\nYOU'RE RACIST, YOU'RE RACIST, YOU'RE RACIST.\nTHEY KEEP SAYING IT. YOU'RE RACIST.\nTHEY KEEP GOING BACK TO THE SAME WELL.\nBUT YOU KNOW WHAT, THE PEOPLE ARE BECOMING VERY SMART.\nTHEY'VE HEARD IT TOO MANY TIMES BEFORE.\nTHE WELL IS DRY. THE WELL IS DRY.\n>> YOU DIRECTLY CALLED HER A BIGOT.\n>> SHE IS A BIGOT. YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO\nTHE INNER CITIES. YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS AND HISPANICS IN THIS COUNTRY.\n>> HOW IS SHE BIGOTED? >> BECAUSE SHE'S SELLING THEM\nDOWN THE TUBES. SHE'S NOT DOING ANYTHING FOR\nTHOSE COMMUNITIES. SHE TALKS A GOOD GAME.\n>> YOU'RE SAYING SHE HAS HATRED. >> HER POLICIES ARE BIGOTED.\nHER POLICIES ARE BIGOTED BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO WORK.\n>> YOU'RE SAYING SHE'S PERSONALLY BIGOTED.\n>> HER POLICIES. SHE COMES OUT WITH THE POLICIES\nAND OTHERS THAT BELIEVE LIKE SHE DOES ALSO.\nLOOK AT THE POVERTY. LOOK AT THE RISE IN POVERTY.\nLOOK AT THE RISE IN VIOLENCE. >> HATRED IS AT THE CORE OF THAT\nOR DISLIKE. >> I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.\n>> GENE, ON THE FRONT END, DOES TRUMP HAVE ANY POINT HERE ABOUT\nTHE DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S RESPONSIVENESS TO\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS? AND, SECONDLY, EVEN IF HE HAS A\nPOINT, DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE FOR HIM NOT TO KEEP\nDRIVING THE CAR OFF INTO THE DITCH, WHICH HE DID AT THE END\nOF THAT CLIP WITH ANDERSON. >> WELL, LOOK, I DON'T THINK\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS DO OR NECESSARILY SHOULD SORT OF STAND\nBACK AND POINT A FINGER AT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND SAY YOU\nSHOULD DO THIS OR YOU'RE NOT DOING THAT.\nBECAUSE, IN FACT, AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE A HUGE\nPART OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AT EVERY LEVEL.\nSTARTING WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nBUT DOWN TO THE GRASSROOTS. SO, IN A SENSE, I THINK WE\nALWAYS SHOULD POINT FINGERS AT OURSELVES AND, YOU KNOW, AM I\nDOING WHAT I CAN DO? ARE WE DOING WHAT WE CAN DO\nREGARDLESS OF POLITICAL PARTY. BUT THAT'S -- IT'S FALSE TO EVEN\nSET UP THIS DICHOTOMY AT THIS POINT OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS OVER\nHERE AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY OVER THERE FOR A VARIETY OF\nREASONS. YOU KNOW, REVEREND AL IS FAIR --\nMY GRANDPARENTS WERE REPUBLICANS AND, YOU KNOW, AFRICAN-AMERICANS\nARE DEMOCRATS NOW. THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS.\nBUT, YOU KNOW, I DO BELIEVE THAT SUNLIGHT IS THE BEST\nDISINFECTANT. I DON'T GO AROUND LOOKING FOR\nSILVER LININGS AND DARK CLOUDS. I RATHER THE DARK CLOUDS WEREN'T\nHERE. BUT ONE IMPACT OF, YOU KNOW,\nBRINGING TO LIGHT ALEX JONES AND THE ALT-RIGHT AND EVERYTHING\nLIKE THAT. PEOPLE GET TO TAKE A LOOK AT\nTHIS STUFF. >> ONE THING, TOO.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS SORT OF ACCUSED HILLARY CLINTON OF JUST TREATING\nBLACK PEOPLE LIKE VOTES AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING ON THE\nCAMPAIGN TRAIL THAT I DID NOT EXPERIENCE.\nI MEAN, I THINK SHE HAD, I COVERED BERNIE SANDERS AND\nOVERWHELMINGLY A LEGITIMATE CONNECTION AND A LONG HISTORY\nTHERE. THE ONE THING I WILL SAY ABOUT\nTHIS SPEECH. WE ARE NOT SITTING AROUND THIS\nTABLE TODAY TALKING ABOUT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nTHAT'S A BIG REASON WHY THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN DECIDED TO GO\nTHIS ROUTE WITH THIS SPEECH. THEY DON'T NORMALLY TELL US TWO\nDAYS IN ADVANCE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO COME OUT AND TALK ABOUT\nA TOPIC. THEY GAVE EVERYBODY PLENTY OF\nTIME TO SIT AROUND AND DIG INTO THIS.\nWE DID A STOP WITH HER AT A COFFEE SHOP AFTER THIS SPEECH\nAND SHE DID NOT TAKE ANY QUESTIONS.\nPEOPLE TRIED TO ASK HER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION AND SHE SAID, OH, LOOK AT THOSE HARD-WORKING\nREPORTERS. HAVE SOME CHOCOLATES.\n>> I MUST SAY THIS. I THINK IT IS INSULTING TO ACT\nAS THOSE AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS DON'T VOTE THEIR INTERESTS.\nWHEN GEORGE BUSH JR. LEFT OFFICE, BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT WAS\nAT 16%. IT IS NOW CUT IN HALF TO 8%.\nWE BOUGHT OUR INTERESTS. AND THE REASON WE WENT\nDEMOCRATIC IS THEY STARTED SUPPORTING THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT.\nAS I SAID EARLIER, MY PARENTS WERE REPUBLICAN.\nTHEY WENT DEMOCRAT THEN. WE ARE NOT SOME DUMB PEOPLE THAT\nJUST.",

IT IS EXTRAORDINARY WHERE DONALD\nTRUMP HAS BEEN THE LAST FEW DAYS ON HIS SIGNATURE ISSUE.\nTHIS WAS THE ISSUE HE RAN ON MORE THAN ANY OTHER DURING 14\nMONTHS SINCE HE GOT IN THE RACE IN JUNE.\nIT ALL CHANGED THIS WEEK. HE OPENED THE DOOR TO POSSIBLY\nALLOWING SOME OF THE 11 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS TO STAY.\nLAST NIGHT WITH ANDERSON, ESPECIALLY SEEMED TO SHUT THE\nDOOR AGAIN.

I'M NOT SURE ANYONE IS ANGRY\nABOUT THIS THAN HIS FORMER PRIMARY OPPONENTS WHO SAID THIS\nWOULD HAPPEN. TED CRUZ TRIED TO BE THE\nFARTHEST RIGHT ON IMMIGRATION WAS OUT RIGHTED IN SOME WAYS BY\nTHE DONALD TRUMP POLICIES AND WARNED HE WOULD CHANGE WHEN IT\nCAME TO THE GENERAL ELECTION. MARCO RUBIO AND JEB BUSH ALSO\nSAID WHAT YOU ARE PROPOSING IS NOT TENABLE FOR A GENERAL\nELECTION PERSPECTIVE. THE CLIP FROM HANNITY WHERE HE\nTALKED ABOUT RIPPING PEOPLE APART.\nTHAT IS SOMETHING THAT COULD COME OUT OF JEB BUSH OR MARCO\nRUBIO. IT IS REMARKABLE SEEING HIM TEST\nTHESE POSITIONS. >> HE SAID WE WILL WORK WITH\nTHEM. THAT IS REALLY A NEW LINE UNTIL\nLAST NIGHT WHEN IT WASN'T. ANOTHER SORT OF STORY LINE OVER\nTHE PAST 12 HOURS OR SO, HILLARY CLINTON, SHE'S IN NEVADA.\nSHE'S REALLY TRYING TO PAINT DONALD TRUMP AS SOMEONE WHO IS\nOUT OF SYNC WITH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND IN BED WITH THE FRINGE\nRIGHT. LISTEN TO THIS.\n>> THESE ARE RACIST IDEAS. RACE BAITING IDEAS.\nANTI-MUSLIM, ANTI-WOMEN. ALL KEY TENETS MAKING UP WHAT IS\nKNOWN AS THE ALT-RIGHT.

WHAT IS HIS IMMIGRATION?\nIS IT SOFTENING OR HARDENING HERE?\nLISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID ABOUT LEGAL STATUS FOR A MOMENT.\n>> THERE IS NO PATH TO LEGALIZATION UNLESS THEY BELIEVE\nTHE COUNTRY AND COME BACK. THERE'S NO LEGALIZATION.\nTHERE'S NO AMNESTY. IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO GO THE\nLEGALIZATION ROUTE. GO, LEAVE THE COUNTRY, HOPEFULLY\nCOME BACK IN AND WE CAN TALK. >> ALL OF US WHO COVERED\nIMMIGRATION, THERE IS A LOT OF NUANCE AND POLICY AROUND IT.\nTHERE ARE PILLARS OF IT. THERE ARE MAJOR PILLARS OF THE\nDISCUSSION OF IMMIGRATION REFORM AND DEBATE.\nDONALD TRUMP IS SHIFTING ON THOSE ALMOST DAILY.\n>> ABSOLUTELY.

I ALMOST WANT TO START WITH TED\nCRUZ. I'M NOT SURE ANYONE IN AMERICA\nWHO IS ANGRIER ABOUT THIS. DONALD TRUMP LARGELY WON THE\nPRIMARY BY GOING TO THE RIGHT OF TED CRUZ ON IMMIGRATION.\nTED CRUZ STAKED OUT THAT GROUND AND DONALD TRUMP WAS HARDER LINE\nTHAN THAT. HE WAS ASKED MANY TIMES DURING\nTHE PRIMARY IF HE WOULD SOFTEN. HE EXPRESSED BY JEB BUSH AND\nMARCO RUBIO IF YOU GET TO THE GENERAL ELECTION, THAT HARD LINE\nPOLICY WILL NOT FLY WITH THE ELECTORATE.\nLO AND BEHOLD, TRUMP IS TRYING TO KEEP IT BOTH WAYS.\nHE WANTS TO KEEP THE BASE OF THE SUPPORTERS WHO FOLLOW HIM\nSTRONGLY, BUT HE REALIZES THIS IS NOT A GENERAL ELECTION\nPOSITION THAT IS TENABLE. THAT IS WHY HE GOES BACK AND\nFORTH. HE DOESN'T KNOW WHERE HE STANDS.\n>> WHERE HE IS NOW IS WITH THE INTERVIEW HE GAVE US WITH\nANDERSON. NOW HE SAYS THEY ALL HAVE TO GO.\nTHEY HAVE TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY BEFORE THERE IS ANY LEGAL\nSTATUS. THAT IS A BIG BRIGHT LINE.\nTHAT IS WHERE HE WAS A WEEK AGO THAT HE WASN'T.\nNOW HE IS AGAIN. I CAN'T SAY THIS ENOUGH.\nTHE BACK AND FORTH ON A BIG BRIGHT LINE ISSUE TO ME IS\nSTAGGERING. >> YEAH.\nABSOLUTELY. YOU KNOW, HE IS STILL TRYING TO\nWIGGLE WITHIN THAT. HE SAID IF THEY WANT TO BE\nLEGAL, THEY HAVE TO LEAVE AND COME BACK.\nHE IS SAYING THINGS TO ANDERSON, WE'LL SEE.\nGET THE BAD ONES OUT. THE FIRST ACTION AS PRESIDENT.\nWE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. HE IS STILL SORT OF WAFFLING ON\nWHAT COMES NEXT. OKAY, IF YOU GET THE BAD ONES\nOUT, WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? HE STOPPED MENTIONING BACK TAXES\nIN THE INTERVIEW WITH ANDERSON. IT IS NOT CLEAR WHAT THE\nMECHANISM IS. HE ISN'T ANSWERING DIRECTLY THE\nQUESTIONS ANYMORE ABOUT A DEPORTATION FORCE WHICH HE VERY\nEXPLICITLY SUPPORTED EARLIER IN THE PRIMARY.\n>> WE WILL SEE. NEXT WEEK, THEY WILL SHAPE THIS.\nIS HE TALKING ABOUT A TOUCH BACK OR PEOPLE NOT LEAVING OR IF THEY\nSAY WITH A NON IMMIGRANT VISA? WHAT IS THE POLICY?\nLET'S TALK ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON.\nYESTERDAY REALLY GIVING THIS HARD SPEECH ABOUT DONALD TRUMP\nTYING HIM AND HIS POLICIES TO RACISM AND A RACIST FRINGE.\nLISTEN TO HER TALK ABOUT THE ALT-RIGHT MOVEMENT.\n>> THESE ARE RACIST IDEAS, RACE BAITING IDEAS.\nAN ANTI-IMMIGRANTS.\nMAKING UP THE RACIST IDEOLOGY KNOWN AS THE ALT-RIGHT.\nTHE BREITBART AND THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN REPRESENTS A LANDMARK\nACHIEVEMENT FOR THIS GROUP. A FRINGE ELEMENT THAT HAS\nEFFECTIVELY TAKEN OVER THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\nAND THIS IS PART OF A BROADER STORY.\nTHE RISING TIDE OF HARD LINE RIGHT WING NATIONALISM AROUND\nTHE WORLD. >> AND JOHN BERMAN WHO JOKINGLY\nSAID I KNOW YOU ARE, BUT WHAT AM I.\nYOU ARE RUBBER AND I'M GLUE. DONALD TRUMP SAID NO, NO, NO.\nHER POLICIES MAKE HER BIGOTED. SHE IS A BIGOT.\nTHAT WAS THE CONVERSATION. THE OTHER GBIG STORY LINE\nYESTERDAY. REMARKABLE.\n>> WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE EXTERNAL EDGES OF THE\nIDEOLOGICAL MOVEMENT AND AS DONALD TRUMP IS ADDRESSING THE\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND HISPANIC COMMUNITY.\nTHIS IS THE CONSERVATIVE LIBERAL THAT OCCUPIES THE MIDDLE GROUND\nWHICH IS UNDECIDED. HILLARY CLINTON IS TRYING TO\nPAINT TRUMP EXTREME AND OUT OF STEP WITH THE MIDDLE GROUND.\nIT IS SCARY THAT THE MODERATE CONSERVATIVES STAY HOME OR VOTE\nFOR HER. CANNOT STOMACH THE IDEA OF\nDONALD TRUMP. DONALD TRUMP BY TRYING TO MAKE\nTHE PITCH TO MINORITY VOTERS MAY NOT ACTUALLY EXPECT ANY MINORITY\nVOTERS TO GO FOR HIM. HIS NUMBERS ARE ABYSMAL WITH\nTHEM. THAT BRIDGE MAY BE BURNED.\nHE IS TRYING TO CONVINCE THE GROUP IN THE MIDDLE THAT HE IS\nNOT THE RACIST HE IS PORTRAYED BY THE LEFT.\nTHIS IS A GAME ABOUT THE UNDECIDED VOTERS.\nTHOSE PEOPLE WHO MAY BE IN THE MIDDLE AS MUCH AS THE RHETORIC.\n>> WE SAY UNDECIDED VOTERS. IT IS A PLAY FOR A MODERATE\nREPUBLICAN. IT IS NOT SO MUCH IN THE MIDDLE\nAS IT IS IN THE RIGHT OR CENTER RIGHT.\nPEOPLE WHO ARE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH DONALD TRUMP.\nWE HAVE A LOT TO TALK ABOUT IN THE NEXT HALF HOUR.\n>> THANKS FOR GETTING UP EARLY.",

WHEN TRUMP WAS TAKING A HARD\nLINE, BUSH ADVOCATED LETTING THEM STAY.\nNOW IN A NEW INTERVIEW, BUSH SAYS THIS LOOKS LIKE IT IS ALL A\nGAME TO DONALD TRUMP. >> I CAN ONLY SAY THAT WHATEVER\nHIS VIEWS ARE THIS MORNING, THEY MAY CHANGE AND THEY WERE\nDIFFERENT THAN LAST NIGHT AND THEY'LL BE DIFFERENT FROM\nTOMORROW. HIS VIEWS SEEM TO BE EVER\nCHANGING DEPENDING ON WHICH CROWD.\nSOUNDS LIKE A TYPICAL POLITICIAN.\nYOU GET IN FRONT OF ONE CROWD AND SAY ONE THING AND GET IN\nFRONT OF ANOTHER CROWD. >> AFTER JEB BUSH GAVE THAT\nINTERVIEW, TRUMP WENT BACK TO SAYING ALL 11 MILLION\nUNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTED HAS TO LEAVE.\nAND THERE IS ALSO THE BATTLE OVER BIGOTRY.\nHILLARY CLINTON DELIVERING A SPEECH IN NEVADA.\nIN THE INTERVIEW WITH ANDERSON CO\nCOOPER, DONALD TRUMP SAID I KNOW YOU ARE BUT WHAT AM I.\nHILLARY CLINTON IS A BIGOT. LISTEN TO THIS.\n>> YOU CALLED HILLARY CLINTON A BIGOT.\nPREVIOUSLY YOU CALLED HER POLICIES BIGOTED.\n>> SHE IS A BIGOT. YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING TO\nTHE INNER CITIES AND AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND HISPANICS\nIN THIS COUNTRY WHERE SHE TALKS ALL THE TIME.\nSHE IS TALKING. LOOK AT THE VETS.\nSHE IS SAYING THEY ARE TREATED JUST FINE.\nIT IS OVER EXAGGERATED. >> THAT IS HAVING --\n>> SHE IS SELLING THEM DOWN THE TUBES.\nSHE IS NOT DOING ANYTHING FOR THE COMMUNITIES.\n>> SHE HAS HATRED? >> HER POLICIES ARE BIGOTED\nBECAUSE SHE KNOWS THEY WILL NOT WORK.\n>> YOU ARE SAYING SHE IS PERSONALLY BIGOTED.\n>> SHE IS. SHE COMES OUT WITH THE POLICIES\nAND OTHERS THAT BELIEVE LIKE SHE DOES ALSO.\nSHE CAME OUT WITH POLICIES OVER THE YEARS.\nTHIS IS OVER THE YEARS. LONG TIME.\nSHE'S TOTALLY BIGOTED. >> SHE HAS HATRED?\nIN THIS CASE YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT AFRICAN-AMERICANS.\n>> SHE HAS BEEN EXTREMELY BAD FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS.\nI THINK SHE HAS BEEN EXTREMELY BAD FOR HISPANICS.\nYOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED WITH HER POLICIES AND POLICIES OF\nPRESIDENT OBAMA AND OTHERS. LOOK AT THE POVERTY.\nLOOK AT THE RISE IN POVERTY. LOOK AT THE RISE IN VIOLENCE.\n>> HATRED IS AT THE CORE OF IT? >> MAYBE SHE'S LAZY.\n>> SO THAT WAS TRUMP HOLDING THE LINE ON HIS ATTACK AGAINST\nHILLARY CLINTON AS BIGOTED. SHE IS LASHING BACK IN KIND.\nAT A RALLY, SHE HANDED THE REPUBLICAN PARTY OVER TO A\nPARANOID FRINGE ELEMENT. WE HAVE JEFF ZELENY WITH MORE.\n>> Reporter: HILLARY CLINTON HAS DELIVERED A LOT OF SPEECHES ON\nTRUMP. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN LIKE THE\nONE THURSDAY IN RENO. SHE QUESTIONED DONALD TRUMP'S\nCONNECTION TO THE ALT-RIGHT MOVEMENT.\nSHE SAYS IT IS A DIVISIVE RADICAL MOVEMENT.\n>> A LOT OF IT RISING FROM RACIAL RESENTMENT.\nIT NEVER HAD THE NOMINEE OF A MAJOR PARTY STOKING IT,\nENCOURAGING IT AND GIVING IT A NATIONAL MEGA PHONE UNTIL NOW.\n>> Reporter: SHE CITED EXAMPLES FROM BOB DOLE FROM THE 1996\nCONVENTION WHEN HE SAID RACISTS SHOULD LEAVE THE PARTY.\nSHE TALKED ABOUT GEORGE BUSH. SHE TALKED ABOUT JOHN McCAIN WHO\nCRITICIZED THOSE WHO QUESTION PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FAITH BACK IN\n2008. SHE SAID THAT TRUMP IS A\nDIFFERENT KIND OF REPUBLICAN. A DIFFERENT CONSERVATIVELY.\nSHE CALLED IT DANGEROUS. THE QUESTION, OF COURSE, IS SHE\nA CREDIBLE MESSENGER? WILL THEY FOLLOW HER HEED?\n>> JEFF ZELENY. A NEW HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN\nVIDEO IS ALSO ACCUSING DONALD TRUMP OF RACISM.\nTRYING TO CONNECT DONALD TRUMP TO THE KKK AND CHARGING HIM TO\nBEING SLOW TO DISAVOW DAVID DUKE.\nIN A TWEET, TRUMP RESPONDED SAYING OF HILLARY CLINTON, SHE\nSHOULD BE ASHAMED OF HERSELF. AND LAST NIGHT HE REJECTED THE\nSUPPORT OF RACIST VOTERS. >> DO YOU WANT WHITE SUPR\nSUPREMACISTS TO VOTE FOR YOU? >> NOT AT ALL.\nWE LOVE OUR COUNTRY. WE WANT OUR COUNTRY TO COME\nBACK. >> OTHER NEWS, A FEDERAL JUDGE\nSET A DEADLINE FOR THE STATE DEPARTMENT TO DELIVER SOME OF\nHILLARY CLINTON'S E-MAILS UNCOVERED BY THE FBI WITH THE\nCLOCK TICKING TOWARD ELECTION DAY IN NOVEMBER.\nTHE STATE DEPARTMENT MUST HAND THE E-MAILS OVER TO JUDICIAL\nWATCH BY SEPTEMBER 13th.

I MEAN, YOU KNOW, CONSERVATIVES\nESPECIALLY ARE I THINK -- YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU LABEL SOMEBODY\nTHAT LABEL, IT DISCREDITS EVERYTHING THEY HAVE TO SAY.\nIF YOU'RE GOING TO ACCUSE SOMEBODY OF THAT, CALL THEM\nARCHIE BUNKER, YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING TO BACK IT UP.\nTRUMP'S ARGUMENT THAT THEIR POL\nPOLICIES HAVEN'T BEEN GREAT FOB AFRICAN-AMERICANS OR HISPANICS\nIS DEFENSIBLE BUT TO CALL HER A BIGOT, I DON'T GET IT.\n>> YOU'RE THINK CALLING HILLARY CLINTON A BIGOT MIGHT BE A\nCONFUSING MESSAGE TO THE MINORITY GROUPS HE WANTS TO\nATTRACT? >> I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT REALLY\nTO JUST RIGHT NOW THERE'S SO MUCH EXCITEMENT GOING ON WITHIN\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

BECAUSE HE NEEDS TO ADD PEOPLE.\nOBVIOUSLY HE NEEDS TO ADD MINORITIES OR HE WOULDN'T REACH\nOUT TO THEM. >> I REALLY THINK IT'S JUST\nPOLITICS. AGAIN, YOU HAVE TWO CANDIDATES,\nSOME BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE SOME NEGATIVES AND HILLARY CLINTON,\nTHIS IS HER GAME. THEY ACTUALLY PUT OUT THERE\nTODAY WAS HORRIBLE. THE FACT THAT SHE HAD THE KKK\nAND TRIED TO CONNECT THE DOTS TO DONALD TRUMP, THIS FALSE\nNARRATIVE THAT HE'S JUST RACISM, THIS BIGOT.\nSHE'S BEEN CALLING DONALD TRUMP A RACIST FROM THE GET-GO.\n>> SHE NEVER SPECIFICALLY CALLED HIM THAT.\nSHE SAID HE TRAFFICS IN BIGOTRY. SHE'S NEVER SAID DONALD TRUMP IS\nA BIGOT. >> SHE IMPLIES.\nHER ACTIONS, HER POLICIES. THAT'S THE REAL STORY IS SHE'S\nNOT REGRETTABLE OF THE POLICIES THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE WITHIN THE\nDEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT IS IMPACT AFRICAN-AMERICANS.\nTHAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT.\n>> LET ME ASK YOU A PERSONAL QUESTION AS A PERSON-TO-PERSON\nPEOPLE OF COLOR THERE. DOES THAT BOTHER YOU THAT\nSOMEONE IS EXPLICITLY CALLING -- I'VE HEARD THE SURROGATES DO IT,\nTHAT'S THEIR THING TO DO THE WORK OF A CANDIDATE, BUT FOR A\nCANDIDATE TO SAY IT, DOES THAT BOTHER YOU IN ANY WAY?\nFOR A CANDIDATE TO SAY YOU'RE A BIGOT, YOU'RE A RACIST,\nREGARDLESS OF WHO THE CANDIDATE IS?\n>> FOR ME PERSONALLY AS A PASTOR, I THINK NAME CALLING IN\nPOLITICS JUST SHOULDN'T BE THERE AT ALL PERIOD.\nTHAT'S JUST MY PERSONAL OPINION. BUT THEN AGAIN, IT'S A PERSON\nLIKE DONALD TRUMP, IF YOU'RE IN A ROOM FULL OF 16 PEOPLE WHO ARE\nCONSTANTLY CALLING YOU NAMES, ATTACKING YOU, YOU CAN'T BE\nDEFENSIVE, YOU HAVE TO ATTACK AND RESPOND.\nRIGHT NOW OUR COUNTRY NEEDS A WARRIOR.\n>> LET'S LISTEN TO WHAT HILLARY CLINTON SAID TODAY.\n>> FROM THE START DONALD TRUMP HAS BUILT HIS CAMPAIGN ON\nPREJUDICE AND PARANOIA. HE IS TAKING HATE GROUPS\nMAINSTREAM AND HELPING A RADICAL FRINGE TAKE OVER THE REPUBLICAN\nPARTY. >> MATT, THIS IS FOR YOU.\nTRUMP'S ENOUGH CAMPAIGN CEO STEVE BANNON SAYS HIS FORMER WEB\nSITE BREITBART NEWS IS THE PLATFORM FOR THE ALT-RIGHT.\nDO YOU THINK THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO TAKE BREITBART NEWS AT\nMESSAGE EVEN MORE MAINSTREAM, IS THAT THE GOAL HERE?\n>> I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE GOAL BUT, LOOK, I THINK -- SO ON\nONE HAND I AGREE WITH WHAT THE PASTOR WAS SAYING THERE.\nI THINK THAT THE LEFT AND THE MEDIA HAVE ALWAYS ACCUSED\nREPUBLICANS OF BEING RACIST,IN EVEN WHEN IT'S UTTERLY\nUNWARRANTED, WHETHER IT'S RICK PERRY HAVING SOME VACATION SPOT\nTHAT SOMEBODY PREVIOUSLY OWNED AND WRITTEN SOMETHING RACIST ON\nA ROCK OR ATTACKING MITT ROMNEY AS A MISOGYNIST.\nBUT IN THE CASE OF DONALD TRUMP, I THINK HE IS CLEARLY STOKED, IF\nNOT RACIALISM. HE'S PLAYED TO THIS.\nAND I THINK IT'S DIVISIVE. AND WHEN IT COMES TO BREITBART,\nMY CONCERN IS THE MAINSTREAMING OF THIS ALT-RIGHT THING.\nSO THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN WHITE NATIONALISTS AND WHITE\nSUPREMACISTS AND THESE GROUPS OUT THERE ON THE FRINGES, BUT\nBREITBART HAS BROUGHT IT MUCH CLOSER INTO THE MAINSTREAM\nCONSERVATIVE MEDIA WORLD AND I THINK TRUMP LARGELY HAS DONE THE\nSAME THING. >> HE HAS SAID, THOUGH, TONIGHT\nIN THE INTERVIEW WE PLAYED EARLIER THAT HE DOES NOT WANT\nWHITE SUPREMACISTS TO VOTE FOR HIM.\nHE SAYS I DON'T WANT YOUR VOTE, WHICH MANY HAVE BEEN WAITING A\nLONG TIME TO HEAR HIM SAY THAT. PASTOR BURNS, I WANT TO PLAY A\nCLIP FROM AN ALTERCATION YOU HAD EARLIER WITH A PROTESTER OUTSIDE\nTRUMP TOWER. >> DO YOU WANT ME -- YOU WANT MY\nMOTHER AND MY LITTLE SISTER -- >> JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE TALKING\nLOUD ARE THAN ME DON'T MAKE YOU RIGHT.\n>> DO YOU WANT MY LITTLE SHBROTR TO BE SEPARATED FROM MY MOTHER?\nDO YOU WANT MY MOTHER AND FATHER TO BE DEPORTED?\n>> HAS THIS HAPPENED OFTEN TO YOU FOR YOU?\nDO YOU ENCOUNTER THIS? >> NO, NOT IN MOST CASES, PEOPLE\nARE AFRAID OF ME. THEY KNOW I DON'T PLAY NO GAMES.\n>> SO WHAT HAPPENED? >> I JUST GOT FINISHED\nINTERVIEWING ON THIS NETWORK HERE AND THEN WHEN I GOT DONE,\nALL THE MEDIA, THE FRINGE TURNED AROUND AND BEGAN TO INTERVIEW ME\nAND THEY WERE OUT THERE CHANTING, ET CETERA.\nAND THE GENTLEMAN BEGAN TO TALK TO ME CALMLY.\nI KNEW HE WAS IN DISAGREEMENT WITH ME.\nSO I LITERALLY GRABBED HIM BY THE ARM AND HAD HIM FOLLOW WITH\nME, WALK WITH ME WHILE I'M TALKING.\nI WOULD LOVE TO HEAR WHAT HE HAS TO SAY.\nI THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT WE WAS ABOUT TO ENGAGE INTO AN\nINTELLIGENT CONVERSATION. HE WAS SAYING ARE YOU OKAY WITH\nME GOING BACK? >> I WANTED TO HEAR HIS\nGRIEVANCES, I WANTED TO HEAR -- >> ARE YOU OKAY WITH THAT, THE\nDEPORTATION OF PEOPLE THAT ARE HERE?\n>> I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT LIKE DONALD TRUMP HAS SAID, WE\nEITHER HAVE A COUNTRY OR WE DO NOT HAVE A COUNTRY.\nI KNOW THAT MAY SOUND HARSH BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS WE\nEITHER HAVE BORDERS OR WE DON'T. AND THERE IS A LAW THAT THE\nAMERICAN HAS PUT INTO PLACE. IT IS NOT MARK BURNS' LAW IT'S\nNOT DONALD TRUMP'S LAW, IT IS A LAW THAT THE AMERICAN\nCONSTITUTION HAS PUT IN PLACE. >> SO HIM SAYING NOW THAT HE IS\nSOFTENING SO TO SPEAK, THAT HE WANTS TO WORK WITH PEOPLE AND\nNOT SEND THEM BACK, DOES THAT BOTHER YOU AT ALL?\nTHAT'S A TURN AROUND. >> THAT'S NOT A TURN AROUND.\nTHAT'S SIMPLY AS WE'RE GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE RACE,\nDONALD TRUMP IS JUST GIVING DETAILS OF HIS PLAN.\nTHIS IS DETAILED INFORMATION. >> PASTOR, HE'S NEVER SAID THAT\nFROM THE BEGINNING. FROM THE BEGINNING HE SAID THEY\nHAVE -- >> HE WOULDN'T HAVE WON IF HE\nSAID THAT. THAT'S WHAT MARCO RUBIO AND JEB\nBUSH SAID. >> HE WAS VERY EXPLICIT OR\nSPECIFIC ABOUT THEY HAVE TO GO BACK.\n>> I THINK HE STAYED PRETTY CLEAR ON THE DEPORTATIONS.\n>> HE SAID WE'RE GOING TO WORK WITH THEM, THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE\nTO PAY TAXES. THAT'S WHAT CITIZENS DO.\nYOU MAY NOT EXPLICITLY BE SAYING IT'S A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP BUT\nWHEN YOU'RE A U.S. CITIZEN, THAT'S PART OF BEING A CITIZEN,\nPAYING TAXES. >> THIS IS WHAT THE DEMOCRATIC\nPARTY DO VERSUS WHAT THE REPUBLICAN --\n>> WHAT I'VE DONE? >> NO, THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.\nAND WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS DOING. THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY SAY I'M AT\nTHE TOP, HILLARY CLINTON I'M AT THE TOP, YOU PEOPLE WILL DO WHAT\nI SAY. DONALD TRUMP SAYS I HAVE BEEN\nLISTENING TO THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE.\nNOW, YES, I DECLARED IN THE BEGINNING EVERYBODY'S GONE --\n>> EVERYBODY UP ON THAT STAGE WITH HIM DURING THAT DEBATE --\n>> LET ME FINISH MY STATEMENT. HE DID SAY I'VE BEEN HEARING\nPEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND PEOPLE ARE TELLING ME,\nMR. TRUMP, THAT IS HARSH, AND HE IS NOW LISTENING TO THE VOICE OF\nTHE PEOPLE. THE PEOPLE, WE AS AMERICANS\nSHOULD DICTATE TO THE POLITICIANS.\n>> SO IF THE PEOPLE SAY TO HIM WE DON'T WANT DEPORTATION, WE\nWANT A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP, WE WANT AMNESTY, IS HE GOING TO GO,\nOKAY? >> THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, FIRST OF\nALL, THEY HAVE TO MAKE HIM PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\n>> THAT'S WHAT THE POLLS SHOW THAT MOST PEOPLE IN AMERICA ARE\nOKAY WITH THAT. >> AND WHEN HE BECOMES PRESIDENT\nOF THE UNITED STATES AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SUGGEST WE WANT\nTHIS -- HE'S GOING TO DO WHAT THE PEOPLE SAY.\nTHAT'S WHAT DEMOCRACY IS. WE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED\nSTATES. THE PEOPLE DICTATE THE POLICIES,\nNOT THE POLITICIANS LIKE HILLARY CLINTON AND THE DEMOCRATIC\nPARTY. >> WHY ARE YOU SMILING?\n>> BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU JUST HAVE TO LAUGH TO KEEP FROM\nCRYING, YOU KNOW THAT. I FEEL YA.\nI KNOW, IT'S TOUGH SOMETIMES. AS THEY SAY.\nI GET IT. THANK YOU, MATT.\nCOMING UP, SHIFTING IDEAS ON",

THIS WENT SOMETHING FARTHER\nDEEPER THAN SHE'S GONE TALKING ABOUT WHAT HE TRULY BELIEVES IN\nAND FORCES VOTERS, URGING THEM TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY BELIEVE\nOF RACE IN AMERICA. LET'S LISTEN.\n>> THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN A PARANOID FRINGE IN OUR POLITICS.\nA LOT OF IT ARISING FROM RACIAL RESENTIMENT, BUT IT'S NEVER HAD\nTHE NOMINEE OF A MAJOR PARTY STOKING IT, ENCOURAGING IT AND\nGIVING IT A NATIONAL MEGAPHONE UNTIL NOW.\n>> SHE SAID THAT REPUBLICANISM HAS NEVER BEEN LIKE THIS AND\nCONSERVATIVE HAS NEVER BEEN LIKE THIS.\nSHE'S TRYING TO REACH OUT TO THOSE VOTERS IN THE MIDDLE WHO\nDON'T LIKE WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS SAYING, SOME OF THOSE REPUBLICAN\nVOTERS. THE CHALLENGE FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON IS SHE'S NOT A CREDIBLE MESSENGER WITH SOME OF THOSE\nVOTERS. SHE HAS ISSUES OF HER OWN ON\nHONESTY, TRUSTWORTHINESS AND OTHER THINGS.\nWE'LL HAVE TO SEE HOW THIS SPEECH SETTLES IN TO VOTERS AT\nLARGE.

OTHERS THAT BELIEVE LIKE SHE\nDOES ALSO. SHE CAME OUT WITH POLICIES OVER\nTHE YEARS. THIS IS OVER THE YEARS.\n>> IT DOESN'T APPLY -- SHE HAS HATRED, I GUESS TOWARD\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS. >> SHE'S BEEN EXTREMELY BAD FOR\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS. I THINK SHE'S BEEN EXTREMELY BAD\nFOR HISPANICS. YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH\nHER POLICIES AND THE POLICIES OF PRESIDENT OBAMA AND OTHERS, LOOK\nAT THE POVERTY. LOOK AT THE RISE IN POVERTY.\nLOOK AT THE RISE IN VIOLENCE. >> HATRED IS AT THE CORE OF\nTHAT? >> I DON'T KNOW.\nMAYBE SHE'S LAZY. >> WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO\nTHAT? >> PATHETIC.\nHE'S A CHEAP CON MAN. HE CONNED THE REPUBLICAN PARTY\nINTO THE NOMINATION. HE'S NOT GOING TO CON\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS INTO THINKING HE'S FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS.\nHIS RECORD, HIS OWN VOICE SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.\nWHEN YOU TALK ABOUT WHO BIGOTED, HE STARTED OUT EVEN RUNNING HIS\nCAMPAIGN BY DENYING THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT.\nTRYING TO SAY HE WAS NOT AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN.\nI CAN GUARANTEE YOU, NOT IN AMERICA, I CAN GUARANTEE YOU IF\nHE WAS NOT AFRICAN-AMERICAN, HE WOULD HAVE NEVER HAD THE BIRTHER\nSITUATION. GUARANTEE IT.\nIT'S BECAUSE OF BARACK OBAMA HAPPENED TO BE AFRICAN-AMERICAN.\nHE TALKED ABOUT TAKING OUR COUNTRY BACK.\nBACK FROM WHO? YOU HAVE THE FIRST\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT SO HE'S SAYING TAKE IT BACK,\nCLAIMING THAT AFRICAN-AMERICAN NOW BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS\nPRESIDENT, WE NEED TO TAKE THE COUNTRY BACK.\nIT'S HIS WORD. IT'S THE CODE WORDS.\nHE INITIALLY TRIED TO SAY HE DID NOT KNOW WHO DAVID DUKE WAS.\nHE TALKED ABOUT MEXICANS THAT THEY ARE CRIMINALS AND RAPISTS.\nHE TALKED ABOUT AN AMERICAN CITIZEN WHO HAPPENED TO BE A\nJURIST THAT HE COULDN'T DO HIS JOB BECAUSE HE'S MEXICAN.\nTHIS IS NOT WHAT I'M SAYING. AS A RESULT, THIS IS HIS WORDS.\nTHERE ARE MANY REPUBLICANS WHO DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH\nHIM. THAT'S WHY AT THE REPUBLICAN\nCONVENTION YOU DIDN'T SEE MANY REPUBLICANS WHO ARE IN ELECTED\nOFFICE OR POSITIONS OF RESPONSIBILITY EVEN GO TO THE\nREPUBLICAN CONVENTION BECAUSE THEY DID NOT WANT TO BE\nASSOCIATED WITH THOSE BIGOTED REMARKS THAT CAME OUT OF THE\nMOUTH OF DONALD TRUMP. IF IT LOOKS LIKE A DUCK, QUACKED\nLIKE A DUCK, IT IS A DUCK AND THAT'S DONALD TRUMP.\n>> HE'S BEEN ATTEMPTING TO REACH OUT TO AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS\nRECENTLY, SPEAKING DIRECTLY TO THEM.\nMAYBE NOT BEFORE THEM BUT TO THEM ON CAMERA.\nONE OF THE THINGS HE'S SAYING IS LOOK AT CERTAIN CITIES.\nBALTIMORE, FOR INSTANCE. HE SAYS DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN IN\nCHARGE OF GOVERNING THESE CITIES AND YET THEY ARE STILL FACING\nTREMENDOUS CHALLENGES. THERE NEEDS TO BE CHANGE.\nWHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT? THERE ARE SOME CITIES WHERE\nDEMOCRATS ARE GOVERNING AND THERE'S STILL JUST TREMENDOUS\nISSUES. >> DONALD TRUMP IS A CON MAN.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS NO POLICIES -- >> WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT\nPOINT? >> I'M GOING TO GET TO IT.\nHE'S NOT THE MESSENGER BECAUSE HE'S NOT TALKING TO BLACKS.\nTHAT'S WHY HE'S NOT BEFORE ANY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHEN HE\nTALKS. THERE ARE POOR APPALACHIAN\nCOMMUNITIES THAT ARE GOVERNED BY REPUBLICANS AND THEY ARE STILL\nPOOR. WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO\nRESOLVE THIS TOGETHER. THAT'S WHAT HILLARY CLINTON\nTALKING ABOUT. WE'RE BETTER TOGETHER.\nWE HAVE POVERTY AND CRIME IN ALL PARTS OF AMERICA.\nWE CAN LOOK AT THE AREAS WHERE THERE'S BEEN POVERTY SO WE CAN\nFIX IT. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON HAS EMBRACED. GOVERNMENT MOVES SLOW.\nYOU'RE TALKING ABOUT EQUITY DISPARITY AND EQUITY AS FAR AS\nINCOME DISPARITY. WELL, LOOK, IN THE '90S, UNDER\nTHE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION, INCOME DISPARITY WAS BECOMING\nCLOSER AND CLOSER. IT'S THE 2000s, NOT WHEN\nDEMOCRATS WERE IN CONTROL. WHEN REPUBLICANS WERE IN CONTROL\nTHAT WE HAD THE 2008 CRISIS THAT CAUSED THE GREATEST DISPARITY\nTHAT WE HAD IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY.\n>> WE DID SEE SOME OF THE THINGS HAPPEN IN THE CLINTON\nADMINISTRATION DID LEAD TO THAT. >> NOT INCOME DISPARITIES.\nYOU CAN TALK ABOUT THE -- >> THE FINANCIAL CRASH IS WHAT\nI'M TALKING ABOUT. I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT\nTHE EARNINGS GAP. >> EVEN THE FINANCIAL CRASH.\nIT WAS THOSE WHO PUT IN PLACE BY REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATION TO\nOVERSEE IT. >> I WILL SAY IT WAS BILL\nCLINTON WHO SIGNED INTO LAW THE DEREGULATION OF THOSE SECURITIES\nTHAT LED TO THE CRASH. I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT\nSOMETHING WE HAVE BEEN HEARING PEOPLE SAY.\nTHEY SAY THIS IS CYNICAL THAT SHE DID THIS TODAY.\nSHE'S BEEN STRUGGLING WITH REAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION. VERY REASONABLE CONCERNS THAT\nPEOPLE HAVE ABOUT IT. THIS WAS HER TRYING TO CHANGE\nTHE SUBJECT. >> LISTEN, TO ME, WHEN YOU LOOK\nAT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, NUMBER ONE, IT'S A FIVE-STAR\nFOUNDATION. IF YOU TALK TO ANY IMPARTIAL\nINDIVIDUAL THAT TALK ABOUT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION AND WHAT IT\nDOES TO SAVE THE LIVES OF THOUSANDS, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS\nOF PEOPLE, IT IS BY FAR THE STANDARD THAT THEY WOULD LIKE A\nNUMBER OF OTHER FOUNDATIONS TO FOLLOW.\nTHE CLINTON FOUNDATION IS NOT ABOUT THE CLINTONS PUTTING ANY\nMONEY IN THEIR POCKETS. DONALD TRUMP HAS ONLY BEEN ABOUT\nPUTTING MONEY IN HIS POCKET AND HIS FAMILY'S POCKET.\n>> IT'S NOT THE DISPUTING OF THE GOOD WORKS.\nEVEN WITH ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION HAS DONE MANY\nGOOD THING, THE ISSUE IS THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST.\nTHAT'S REALLY THE ISSUE HERE. THERE ARE REAL QUESTIONS ABOUT\nTHAT. >> THERE'S NOT BEEN ANY --\n>> OR AN APPEARANCE OF A CONFLICT OF INTEREST, WHICH IS\nYOU KNOW IS VERY IMPORTANT. >> YOU CAN MAKE UP SMOKE OR MAKE\nUP ANYTHING THAT YOU WANT TO MAKE UP.\nI'VE HEARD DONALD TRUMP SAY THAT THE WORST NETWORK ON TELEVISION\nIS CNN. IT'S GARBAGE.\nWE KNOW YOU DO GOOD WORK. HE'S TALKED ABOUT SOMETIMES THE\nBAN THE CNN CAMERA. IT'S GARBAGE WHAT HE PUTS OUT\nTHERE. PUT IT OUT THERE ABOUT THIS\nNETWORK AND OTHER NETWORKS AND NEWSCASTERS AND PUTTING IT OUT\nTHERE ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON. IT'S THE SAME GARBAGE THE SAME\nWAY. >> I DO HAVE TO GET IN A QUICK\nBREAK. I'LL HAVE YOU STAND BY FOR ME.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH. WE HAVE MUCH MORE TO DISCUSS,\nAHEAD.",

PETER SCHWEITZER IS THE AUTHOR\nOF \"CLINTON CASH,\" SPEAKING ON FOX TODAY ABOUT HOW THIS IS ALL\nTIED TOGETHER LIKE PUZZLE PIECES THAT WE'RE NOW SEEN FALLING INTO\nPLACE. >> WHEN YOU'RE ENGAGING IN PAY\nTO PLAY ON A GLOBAL SCALE AS YOU WERE WITH THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION, YOU NEED A MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND E-MAIL IS THE\nWAY TO DO IT. YOU CAN'T DO THAT ON THE\nOFFICIAL GOVERNMENT NETWORK BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE DETECTED,\nPEOPLE CAN FILE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT REQUESTS.\nSO YOU NEED TO SET UP A PRIVATE SERVER.\nTHESE TWO SCANDALS ARE CONNECTED.\n>> BUT IT WORKED, AND THERE'S NOTHING, JAY, THAT'S ILLEGAL.\nWHETHER IT MAY BE QUESTIONABLE, THERE'S NOTHING ILLEGAL THAT'S\nBEEN FOUND, WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE, AS SOMEONE HAS ASKED\nPREVIOUSLY? >> IT BEGS THE QUESTION WHETHER\nTHERE WAS ACTUALLY ILLEGALTIVITY HERE.\nTHE CLINTON FOUNDATION IN AND OF ITSELF IS ENTITLED TO RAISE\nMONEY FROM FOREIGN INDIVIDUALS AND GOVERNMENTS.\nONE OF THE PRINCIPALS OF THE CLINTON FOUNDATION HAPPENED TO\nBE THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND IS NOW THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE FOR\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND MAY END UP BEING PRESIDENT\nOF THE UNITED STATES. AS THESE E-MAILS COME OUT, AS\nTHERE'S MORE CONCERNS RAISED AS TO WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH ACCESS\nTO THE SECRETARY OF STATE, IT'S AS IF THE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS\nOFFICE OF THE CHARGE INTON FOUNDATION WAS THE DEPARTMENT OF\nSTATE UNDER THE REIGN OF HILLARY CLINTON.\nAND THAT WOULD BE PROBLEMATIC LEGALLY, SERIOUSLY PROBLEMATIC\nLEGALLY. THERE'S A WHOLE HOST OF NOT ONLY\nREGULATORY VIOLATIONS THAT COULD BE ENGAGED IN.\nTHIS IDEA OF PAY TO PLAY, THERE ARE GOVERNORS SERVING TIME IN\nJAIL FOR ALLEGATIONS MUCH LESS. >> WE'LL WATCH AS NEW\nINFORMATION CONTINUES TO SURFACE.\nAS IT DOES, THERE ARE MORE QUESTIONS, IF NOT ANSWERS.\nAND WE'LL STAND BY AND KEEP LOOKING FOR THOSE AS WE KNOW YOU\nWILL TOO, JAY. >> THE HITS KEEP COMING.\nTHANKS, SHANNON.",
