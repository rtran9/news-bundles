AND ON THAT NOTE I AM JOINED BY\nOUR POLITICAL PANEL. DAVID CHALIAN AND REBECCA BURKE.\nI'M NOT GOING TO ASK YOU TO WEIGH IN ON GOVERNOR PERRY'S\nWHATEVER YOU CALL THAT. DAVID, LET ME ASK YOU, PRESIDENT\nOBAMA, IN PHILLY TODAY, IN PENNSYLVANIA.\nPENNSYLVANIA, A STATE THAT HAS NOT VOTED FOR A REPUBLICAN FOR\nPRESIDENT SINCE 1988. DOES THE FACT THAT HE WENT TO\nPENNSYLVANIA SUGGEST THAT THAT STATE IS IN PLAY?\n>> WELL, IT DEFINITELY SUGGESTS THAT.\nTHERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. ALSO, WHERE HE WENT SPECIFICALLY\nIN PHILADELPHIA IS WITH A TASK AT HAND BECAUSE THERE ARE\nCERTAIN PARTS OF THE OBAMA COALITION THAT RIGHT NOW HILLARY\nCLINTON IS UNDERPERFORMING WITH IN A LOT OF BATTLE GROUND STATE\nPOLLS. SPECIFICALLY WITH LATINOS AND\nYOUNG PEOPLE. SO GOING TO A MINORITY HEAVY\nCOMMUNITY LIKE PHILADELPHIA WHERE IT ALSO HAS A LOT OF YOUNG\nPEOPLE, HE IS THERE TO ACTUALLY TURN OUT THE COALITION.\nBUT MORE BROADLY TO PENNSYLVANIA AND YOUR POINT, I THINK\nPENNSYLVANIA MAY END UP BEING ONE OF THE KEYS TO THIS\nELECTION. DONALD TRUMP'S PATH, AS WE'VE\nTALKED ABOUT, IT IS NARROW. IT'S A TOUGH CLIMB TO GET --\n>> HE HAS TO RUN THE TABLE REALLY.\n>> HE DOES. PENNSYLVANIA IS A TRIGGER FOR\nHIM. IF HE CAN'T MAKE AN INROAD THERE\nAND ACTUALLY CONVERT THAT STATE, HIS ABILITY TO GET TO 270\nBECOMES MUCH MORE COMPLICATED. HE HAS TO PUT LIKE SEVEN OTHER\nREALLY COMPETITIVE STATES ON HIS SIDE.\nPENNSYLVANIA, IF HE CAN WOO IT TO HIS SIDE, OPENS UP A PATH TO\n270. >> I AGREE IT'S KEY.\nHE IS GOING THERE THIS EVENING TO PRESENT HIS PLAN FOR PAID\nMATERNITY LEAVE. REBECCA, I WONDER, OTHER\nREPUBLICANS IN THE PAST, EVERYONE ALWAYS TALKS ABOUT\nGOING AFTER PENNSYLVANIA THE SAME WAY DEMOCRATS ALWAYS TALK\nABOUT MISSOURI. AND AT THE END OF THE DAY,\nTHREE, FOUR WEEKS OUT I THINK HE MEANS IT.\nMR. TRUMP I THINK WILL BE CAMPAIGNING THERE UNTIL THE VERY\nEND. >> THE REASON HE IS DOING FAIRLY\nWELL IN PENNSYLVANIA AND MAYBE BETTER THAN WE WOULD EXPECT IS\nBECAUSE, AS YOU KNOW, THE WHITE WORKING CLASS -- THERE IS A\nHIGHER PROPORTION THAN IN OTHER STATES.\nTHAT'S WHY TRUMP IS DOING WELL IN IOWA WHICH OBAMA WON BY FIVE\nPOINTS IN 2012. BECAUSE HE WAS ABLE TO WIN OVER\nTHE WHITE WORKING CLASS IN A WAY HILLARY CLINTON IS NOT.\nDONALD TRUMP IS COMPLETELY CONSOLIDATING THIS DEMOGRAPHIC.\nIN STATES WITH A HIGHER PROPORTION OF WHITE WORKING\nCLASS, A LOWER PROPORTION OF COLLEGE-EDUCATED VOTERS, HE HAS\nA REALLY GOOD CHANCE. WITH THE NEW MESSAGE HE IS\nLOOKING TO BRING NEW VOTERS IN HIS FOLD.\nSUBURBAN WHITE WOMEN. WITH THE PAID MATERNITY PUSH.\nIT'S NOT A CONVENTIONAL REPUBLICAN POSITION.\nIT'S ONE SOME OF TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS IN THE PAST LIKE\nLAURA INGRAM AND SEAN HANNITY HAVE MOCKED.\n>> IT'S A DEMOCRAT POSITION, BASICALLY TO HAVE SIX WEEKS PAID\nMATERNITY LEAVE FOR MOMS. DAVID, LET ME ASK YOU, THE\nATTEMPT TO GO AROUND THE COLLAR OF PHILADELPHIA AND WINNING OVER\nTHE MOMS. WHEN MIKE PENCE REFUSES TO USE\nTHE WORD \"DEPLORABLE\" TO TALK ABOUT DAVID DUKE AND IT COMES IN\nTHE CONTEXT OF A LOT OF RATHER DEPLORABLE PEOPLE BEING VERY\nVOCAL TRUMP SUPPORTERS, NOT A MAJORITY, NOT HALF, BUT A LOT OF\nTHEM. AND I JUST WONDERED, DOES THAT\nHURT THAT ATTEMPT TO GO INTO THE COLLAR, TO GO INTO MONTGOMERY\nCOUNTY AND THE OTHER SUBURBS OUTSIDE PHILLY AND TO OTHER\nWOMEN? >> IT'S WHY WE SEE -- YOU KNOW,\nWHEN DONALD TRUMP WAS OUT COURTING THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nVOTE, GOING -- YOU REMEMBER HE WENT TO MICHIGAN, HE WENT TO\nOTHER PLACES. EVEN THOUGH HE WAS TALKING TO\nLARGELY WHITE CROWDS INITIALLY BEFORE THE DETROIT TRIP, HE WAS\nTALKING ABOUT HIS WOOING OF THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE AND HOW\nWELL HE THOUGHT -- WE TALKED THEN, IT WASN'T ABOUT JUST\nTRYING TO DIG INTO HILLARY CLINTON'S ENORMOUS ADVANTAGE\nWITH AFRICAN-AMERICANS. PART OF THAT WAS TO APPEAL TO\nWHITE SUBURBANITES AS A MORE TOLERANT PERSON THAN THEY THINK\nHE IS. THAT HE IS WILLING TO DO THE\nOUTREACH. THAT WAS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF\nWHAT HE WAS DOING. WHEN MIKE PENCE DOESN'T WANT TO\nUSE THE WORD \"DEPLORABLE\" AND WON'T USE THAT AND SAY DAVID\nDUKE IS DEPLORABLE AND THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN MAKES HAY OF\nTHAT, THE FIRST PLACE THAT WILL BE FELT IS IN THESE SUBURBAN\nAREAS. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN PEOPLE WHO\nMAY BE ON THE FENCE, IF THEY THINK THE TRUMP/PENCE CAMPAIGN\nIS TOLERANT OF THIS HATRED, IT BECOMES A HUGE TURNOFF.\n>> YOU DON'T WANT TO USE THE SAME WORD AS HILLARY CLINTON.\nWHY NOT JUST SAY IT'S DISGUSTING, RACIST, I HATE IT, I\nDON'T WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO IT.\nWE'VE SEEN THIS DONALD TRUMP RETWEETING WHITE SUPREMACISTS,\nPEOPLE WITH THE NAME \"WHITE GENOCIDE\" IN THEIR HANDLE.\nEXPLAIN TO ME WHAT YOU THINK IS GOING ON.\n>> IT'S A LITTLE CONFUSING BECAUSE MIKE PENCE WILL GO OUT\nTHERE AND SAY WE DON'T WANT HIS SUPPORT, WE DON'T WANT THE\nSUPPORT OF PEOPLE WHO THINK THE WAY THAT DAVID DUKE THINKS.\nBUT THEN GOING ONE STEP FURTHER TO SAY DEPLORABLE IS A LINE HE\nWON'T CROSS. PART OF THIS CALCULATION, I\nTHINK, IS THAT THEY RECOGNIZE THEIR CORE SUPPORTERS ARE\nCOMPRISED, IN PART, BY THESE ALT-RIGHT PEOPLE, BUT PEOPLE WHO\nHAVE THESE WHITE NATIONALIST VIEWS.\nAND THEY DON'T WANT TO TURN OFF ANY CORE SUPPORTERS IN THE LAST\n55 DAYS OF THIS ELECTION. BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO JUST AN\nADMISSION BY THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN THAT THIS IS NOT TURF THAT'S\nFAVORABLE TO THEM. THEY WANT TO MOVE THE\nCONVERSATION IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION.\nTHAT'S WHY I AM REALLY INTERESTED BY THIS TACTIC,\nFOCUSING ON THE BASKET OF DEPLORABLES COMMENT.\nBECAUSE TRUMP SEEMS TO THINK THAT THIS IS A GOOD -- IT'S A\nGOOD PIECE OF TURF FOR HIM, THAT HE CAN ENERGIZE HIS SUPPORTERS,\nSAY HILLARY CLINTON WAS INSULTING YOU, GET THEM RILED UP\nA LITTLE BIT. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THEN THE\nCONVERSATION IS, HOW MANY OF TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS ARE IN THE\nBASKET OF DEPLORABLES? >> IT'S NOT HALF.\nIS IT A THIRD, A QUARTER? >> AS YOU SAID, THEY HAVE\nDISAVOWED DAVID DUKE. DONALD TRUMP HAS DONE IT ON\nMULTIPLE OCCASIONS. YOUR INTERVIEW WITH HIM BACK IN\nFEBRUARY, IT WAS, I GUESS, WAS THE KICKOFF OF THAT NO DOUBT.\nBUT THEY HAVE DISAVOWED IT AS YOU'VE SAID.\nTHEY SAY WE ARE NOT INTERESTED IN THE SUPPORTERS.\nI THINK IT'S A PURE POLITICAL. THEY WANT THE WORD \"DEPLORABLE\"\nTO BE COMPLETELY OWNED BY HILLARY CLINTON NOW BECAUSE OF\nHER MISTAKE. >> TUNE INTO CNN TOMORROW NIGHT\nAT 9:00 P.M. EASTERN FOR \"ALMOST PRESIDENT, THE AGONY OF DEFEAT.\"\nTHEY WERE IN CHARGE OF HILLARY CLINTON'S PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVERS\nAND NOW THEY ARE NOT SAYING A WORD TO CONGRESS.\nONE DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER SHOWING UP ON CAPITOL HILL TODAY.\nTHAT STORY NEXT.",

HOW DID HE ADDRESS CLINTON'S\nCOMMENTS AT THIS EVENING'S EVENT?\n>> Reporter: YEAH, ANDERSON, DONALD TRUMP CERTAINLY LATCHED\nONTO THIS BASKET OF DEPLORABLES COMMENT.\nHE ACCUSED HILLARY CLINTON AT THIS RALLY IN ASHEVILLE, NORTH\nCAROLINA, OF RUNNING A CAMPAIGN OF HATRED.\nAT ONE POINT DURING THE RALLY, HE BROUGHT SOME OF HIS\nSUPPORTERS ON STAGE TO SAY THEY'RE NOT DEPLORABLE.\nHE DID GO TOO FAR THE A ONE POINT SAYING THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON HAS ACCUSED THESE PEOPLE OF NOT BEING AMERICAN.\nSHE DID NOT EVER SAY THAT. AND WE SHOULD POINT OUT,\nANDERSON, THERE WAS SOME DEPLORABLE BEHAVIOR ON DISPLAY\nHERE. THERE WAS A MAN, TRUMP SUPPORTER\nIN THE CROWD PUNCHING AND CHOKING ONE PROTESTER.\nTHAT MAN FROM WHAT WE UNDERSTAND WAS NOT ARRESTED BY AUTHORITIES,\nALTHOUGH THE PROTESTERS WERE LED OUT OF THIS VENUE.\n>> JIM ACOSTA, THANKS VERY MUCH. BACK TO THE PANEL.\nSTUART, AS MUCH AS THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, MEDIA WANTS TO PRESS\nHILLARY CLINTON ON TRANSPARENCY, SHE IS OBVIOUSLY NOW TRYING TO\nUSE WHAT HAPPENED TO HER AND POINT TO DONALD TRUMP AND SAY,\nWELL, WHAT ABOUT HIM? I'M BEING HELD TO ESSENTIALLY A\nDIFFERENT STANDARD. >> LOOK, I THINK THE LITMUS TEST\nHERE IS GOING TO BE THE TAX RETURNS.\nGOVERNOR PENCE HAS RELEASED HIS. IT REALLY IS BEHOLDEN UPON A\nMODERN CANDIDATE TO RELEASE SOME TAX RETURNS.\nYOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT DONALD TRUMP'S INVESTMENTS ARE OR HIS\nCURRENT INCOME. AND JUST THE SORT OF COMMON\nSENSE OF IT IS WHAT PEOPLE COME BACK TO.\nDONALD TRUMP IS SOMEONE WHO'S NOT AFRAID OF SAYING\nCONTROVERSIAL THINGS OR DOING CONTROVERSIAL THINGS.\nWHAT IS IT IN HIS TAX RETURNS THAT HE FINDS SO DISQUALIFYING\nTHAT HE WON'T RELEASE? SO I REALLY DON'T SEE HOW THE\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN CAN WIN AN ARGUMENT ON TRANSPARENCY UNTIL\nTHEY DO THAT. IF DONALD TRUMP WALKED OUT\nTOMORROW AND RELEASE THE FIVE YEARS OF TAX RETURNS OR EVEN TWO\nYEARS OF TAX RETURNS, I THINK THAT WOULD GIVE THEM SORT OF\nMORE OF A STANDING TO MAKE THIS CASE.\n>> GLORIA, IF DONALD TRUMP DID THAT, I MEAN, JUST -- I GET THE\nRATIONALE, THE ARGUMENT THAT HE SHOULD DO THAT, BUT IF HE DID\nTHAT, IT'S GOING TO BE A STORY FOR A WEEK AND CAN THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN AFFORD THAT, THE FOCUS TO BE ON HIS RETURNS AND\nWHATEVER THEY SHOW OR DO NOT SHOW FOR, YOU KNOW, WITH SO\nCLOSE BEFORE ELECTION DAY? I MEAN, RIGHT NOW, IT DOESN'T\nSEEM LIKE THAT HE'S WAVERING OR IS BOTHERED BY THE PRESSURE.\n>> THE LONGER THEY WOULD WAIT, THE HARDER IT GETS OBVIOUSLY AND\nOF COURSE IT DEPENDS ON WHAT'S IN THEM.\nUSUALLY CAMPAIGNS TRY TO RELEASE IT A BIT EARLIER RATHER THAN\nLATER, AND, BUT THE QUESTION IS, IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO\nHIDE, DON'T HIDE IT. YOU KNOW, THERE IS NO LAW THAT\nSAYS THAT IF YOU'RE UNDER AUDIT THAT YOU CAN'T RELEASE YOUR\nRETURNS. RICHARD NIXON DID IT, FOR\nEXAMPLE. AND I THINK SO LONG AS DONALD\nTRUMP REFUSES TO DO THAT, HILLARY CLINTON HAS A LEGITIMATE\nRIGHT TO RAISE QUESTIONS, ALL KINDS OF QUESTIONS ABOUT HIM,\nABOUT HIS TRANSPARENCY, ABOUT HIS CHARITABLE GIVING, ABOUT HIS\nINCOME, ABOUT, YOU KNOW, ALL KINDS OF THINGS THAT VOTERS MAY\nWANT TO KNOW ABOUT. I KNOW CONGRESSMAN PENCE,\nGOVERNOR PENCE, SAID TO WOLF BLITZER TODAY THAT VOTERS DON'T\nCARE ABOUT THAT, BUT ONCE THEY KNOW WHAT'S IN THEM, THEN THEY\nMIGHT CARE ABOUT IT. AND SO THE LONGER THEY WAIT, THE\nHARDER IT IS FOR DONALD TRUMP -- >> YEAH.\n>> -- TO DO IT. >> COREY, YOU AND I TALKED ABOUT\nTHIS IN THE LAST HOUR, I MEAN, AGAIN, IF YOU BELIEVE THE MY\nTAXES ARE UNDER AUDIT ARGUMENT, THEREFORE I'M NOT GOING TO\nRELEASE THEM, ACCORDING TO HIS OWN ATTORNEYS IF 2002 TO 2008,\nTHOSE RETURNS HAVE BEEN AUDITED, THE AUDIT IS DONE.\nWHY NOT RELEASE BOTH THOSE? >> LOOK, I THINK HE'S BEEN VERY\nCLEAR ABOUT RELEASING HIS INFORMATION THAT'S REQUIRED WHEN\nYOU RUN FOR PRESIDENT WHICH IS THE PERSONAL FINANCIAL\nDISCLOSURE STATEMENT WHICH MANY PUNDITS SAID HE'D NEVER FILL OUT\nBECAUSE IT WOULD SHOW HE'S NOT ACTUALLY WORTH WHAT HE SAID HE'S\nWORTH. WHAT IT ACTUALLY SHOWS IS HE HAS\n50 ENTITIES WORTH MORE THAN $50 MILLION A PIECE.\nBUT, YOU KNOW, THE ONE THING I DO WANT TO TOUCH ON, IT'S VERY\nIMPORTANT, THIS IS BARACK OBAMA'S STATEMENT.\nWE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO'S FIGHTING FOR ALL AMERICANS, NOT\nONE WHO WRITES OFF NEARLY HALF OF THE COUNTRY.\nRIGHT? THIS GOES DIRECTLY TO HILLARY\nCLINTON. WE WANT A PRESIDENT WHO'S\nFIGHTING FOR ALL AMERICANS. THIS NOTION OF DEPLORABLES WHICH\nIS WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT, SHE'S NOT FIGHTING FOR\nEVERYBODY. SHE WANTS TO BE A PRESIDENT FOR\nSOME OF THE COUNTRY. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT BARACK\nOBAMA WAS AGAINST. THAT'S WHY HE BEAT HER EIGHT\nYEARS AGO AND WHY DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO BEAT HER NOW.\n>> DO YOU GET -- YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, LET'S PLAY -- ACTUALLY\nLET ME ASK YOU FIRST BEFORE WE PLAY THIS.\nDO YOU -- DO YOU GIVE HER CREDIT AT ALL FOR APOLOGIZING JUST FOR\nSAYING, YOU KNOW WHAT, NOT HALF, I WAS WRONG TO SAY HALF.\n>> LOOK, I THINK SHE SHOULD APOLOGIZE, BUT, YOU KNOW, DOES\nTHAT MEAN IT'S A QUARTER? WHAT IS IT?\nAGAIN, KELLYANNE CONWAY WAS VERY CLEAR ABOUT THIS.\nTHESE WERE SCRIPTED REMARKS. THIS WASN'T AN AD LIB.\nTHIS WASN'T OFF THE CUFF. THIS WAS DESIGNED TO BE VERY\nSPECIFIC AT A PRIVATE FUND-RAISER WHERE SHE'S SPENDING\nMOST OF HER TIME AND MAYBE SHE DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS GOING TO BE\nBROADCAST, MAYBE SHE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS A BIG DEAL.\nSHE DIDN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND THE BACKLASH UNTIL THE FOLLOWING\nDAY. >> KARINE, I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY\nTHEY HAVE COME FORWARD. THE NEXT DAY SHE SAID, LOOK, I\nSHOULDN'T HAVE SAID HALF. >> 60% OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS\nBELIEVE THE PRESIDENT WAS BORN NOT IN THIS COUNTRY, RIGHT?\nTHIS IS WHAT DONALD TRUMP USED TO FORAY HIMSELF INTO THE\nPOLITICAL -- IT'S TRUE. IT'S TRUE.\nTHIS IS WHAT THE POLLS SAY. IN 2011, THAT'S WHAT DONALD\nTRUMP USED TO GET INTO THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE.\nAND SO THIS IS -- THIS IS THE REALITY THAT WE'RE IN NOW.\n35% OF VOTERS BELIEVE TRUMP IS A RACIST.\n56% OF VOTERS BELIEVE THAT HE HAS NEGATIVE FEELINGS ABOUT\nMINORITIES, WOMEN AND IMMIGRANTS.\n>> AND TRUMP IS STILL WINNING INDEPENDENTS BY 20 POINTS, TRUMP\nIS WINNING MARRIED WOMEN BY 10 POINTS.\nHE'S STILL CONTINUING TO WIN THIS ELECTION BECAUSE HILLARY\nCLINTON IS SO UNTRUSTWORTHY. SHE TALKED TODAY --\n>> THEY'RE BOTH -- I MEAN, THAT'S NOT --\n>> -- ABOUT E-MAILS. IT'S AMAZING SHE RAISED THAT\nISSUE. SHE SAID PEOPLE HAVE READ MY\nE-MAILS. THEY'VE READ NOT THE 15,000 SHE\nWITHHELD. >> THEY CERTAINLY BOTH HAVE\nISSUES ON THE QUESTION OF TRUST --\n>> THAT'S NOT EVEN THE ARGUMENT THERE.\nLOOK, THE QUESTION I HAVE IS WHEN IS DONALD TRUMP GOING TO\nDISAVOW THE PEOPLE, THE ELEMENT, RIGHT, IN HIS CAMPAIGN AND HIS\nSUPPORTERS THAT ARE DEPLORABLE? THE PEOPLE THAT WE JUST TALKED\nABOUT. THE DAVID DUKES OF THE WORLD.\n>> MIKE PENCE DID THAT TODAY. >> THE WHITE SUPREMACISTS.\n>> MIKE PENCE DID THAT TODAY AND DONALD TRUMP HAS DONE IT ON\nMULTIPLE OCCASIONS. UNLESS YOU'RE CALLING MIKE PENCE\nA RACIST, WHICH I DON'T THINK YOU ARE --\n>> I NEVER SAID THAT. I NEVER SAID THAT.\nDAVID DUKE WHO IS A FORMER GRAND WIZARD OF THE KKK THAT\nTERRORIZED -- >> HE HAS SAID HE --\n>> YEAH, BUT HE IS DEPLORABLE. THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE.\nDAVID DUKE IS ACTUALLY DEPLORABLE.\nTHE KKK IS DEPLORABLE. WHITE SUPREMACY --\nROBERT BYRD APOLOGIZED.

IS RECOVERING FROM PNEUMONIA.\nHERE'S MY INTERVIEW WITH HER TONIGHT.\nDAVID AXELROD IS CRITICAL OF THE WAY YOU AND YOUR CAMPAIGN\nHANDLED -- HE TWEETED \"ANTIBIOTICS CAN TAKE CARE OF\nPNEUMONIA, WHAT'S THE CURE FOR AN UNHEALTHY PENCHANT FOR\nPRIVACY THAT REPEATEDLY CAUSES UNNECESSARY PROBLEMS?\"\nWHY NOT JUST SAY ON FRIDAY, AS YOU SAID TO SENATOR SCHUMER ON\nSUNDAY, I HAVE PNEUMONIA, FOLKS. I'M GOING TO POWER THROUGH IT.\nWHY KEEP IT A SECRET? >> WELL, I JUST DIDN'T THINK IT\nWAS GOING TO BE THAT BIG A DEAL. YOU KNOW, I KNOW CHUCK SAID\nTODAY HE DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY. IT'S JUST THE KIND OF THING THAT\nIF IT HAPPENS TO YOU, AND YOU'RE A BUSY, ACTIVE PERSON, YOU KEEP\nMOVING FORWARD.

TO INSULT THEM BASED ON\nINSINUATION IS ABSURD. WE CAN SAY LOOK AT PEOPLE\nSUPPORTING HILLARY CLINTON.

GOT THE MARQUIS TO GO IN AND GET\nTHEM GOING. THAT'S MY OPINION ON THAT.\nAND -- BUT THAT I DON'T KNOW. ACTUALLY, THE FTC -- WHEN I LOOK\nTHE -- WHEN I LOOK AT REGULATORY AGENCIES, BY AND LARGE, THE\nHERBALIFE MAY BE MAD AT ME FOR SAYING IT, BUT I THINK THEY'VE\nDONE A PRETTY GOOD JOB BY AND LARGE ON THINGS.\nSO I'M NOT HERE TO ARGUE ABOUT WHAT THEY DID.\nI THINK THEY TOOK MAYBE TOO LONG IN LOOKING AT THIS COMPANY.\nI HONESTLY WILL TELL YOU THAT I THINK THAT THEY KNOW OR MAYBE\nTHEY'RE NOT SAYING IT, THAT WE ARE NOT -- NEVER WERE AND WERE\nNOT A PYRAMID SCHEME. WE MAKE A REAL PRODUCT.\nA PYRAMID SCHEME, I GIVE YOU THIS PENCIL AND YOU GET THREE\nOTHER GUYS TO SELL PENCILS. THAT'S NOT TRUE HERE.\nWE MAKE A PRODUCT, PEOPLE EAT IT.\nBUT THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT  SAYS -- I'M TRYING TO SAVE THESE\nPOOR WOMEN THAT, YOU KNOW, DO THIS THING.\nAND THEY -- THAT'S THEIR ONLY LIVELIHOOD.\nTHEY'RE OUT THERE, THEY HAVE THEIR FRIENDS, AND FRIENDS GO\nAND THEY DRINK THIS DRINK, AND YOU CAN SAY IT'S NO GOOD,\nIT'S -- I'M NOT GOING TO COMMENT ON THE DRINK.\nBUT I WILL SAY THEY MAKE SOME GOOD PRODUCTS, I BELIEVE.\nI PERSONALLY DON'T LIKE THE DRINK.\nI DRANK IT, IT GAVE ME A LOT OF GAS.\nI DIDN'T LIKE IT.

AND I DRINK THIS VITAMIN C.\nTHIS VITAMIN THING EVERY MORNING.\nI HAVEN'T GOT A COLD SINCE I'VE BEEN DRINKING IT.\nI'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR TWO YEARS.\nPUT IT IN THE THING. DRINK THIS STUFF.\nMY POINT TO YOU IS, THEY MAKE GOOD PRODUCTS.\nONE. TWO, THERE IS SOMETHING FOR THIS\nLAST MILE CONCEPT WHERE THERE ARE PEOPLE -- WHEN I WAS A KID,\nI WAS 14, I WAS ALWAYS WORKING. I SOLD FULLER BRUSHES.\nYOU GO -- YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SELL -- YOU KNOCK ON DOORS, SOME\nPEOPLE LIKE IT, SOME PEOPLE SLAM THE DOOR IN YOUR FACE AND YOU GO\nTO YOUR FRIENDS. AND THE FRIENDS BUY THE FULLER\nBRUSHES FROM YOU. THAT'S WHAT THESE PEOPLE DO.\nAND THEY MAKE A LIVING FROM THAT.\nAND SOME PEOPLE MAKE A GREAT LIVING FROM IT.\nNOW, DID THEY GO TOO FAR? SOME OF THESE SALES PEOPLE GO\nTOO FAR, THE DISTRIBUTORS N SAYING, HEY, YOU CAN HAVE A\nMERCEDES-BENZ, I DON'T KNOW. BUT THE REAL ISSUE IS, THAT\nTHESE PEOPLE HAVE JOBS AND ARE WORKING BECAUSE THERE IS A MODEL\nIN IT OUR SOCIETY WHERE YOU'RE NOT -- EVERYTHING ISN'T GOING TO\nBE BOUGHT ON THE INTERNET. AND BY THE WAY, OUR RETAILERS\nDON'T PERSONALLY SELL YOU. THERE IS A MODEL FOR PERSONAL\nSALES. AND THE IRONY -- AND HERE'S A\nQUESTION FOR ACKMAN, TOO. THAT, YOU KNOW, WITH IT ALL, THE\nSALES IN THE UNITED STATES ARE ONLY I THINK 15 OR --\n>> 20%. >> 20%.\nSO IT'S ONLY 20%. UNITED STATES, I THINK, WILL DO\nFINE. I THINK THERE ARE REGULATION\nSOCIAL SECURITY AND SOME OF THE REGULATIONS IN AN IRONIC WAY ARE\nMAYBE GOOD FOR HERBALIFE, BECAUSE WE SPENT THE MONEY IN\nTHE TECHNOLOGY TO POLICE THEM. SOME OF THE SMALLER, YOU KNOW --\nSMALLER SALES OPERATIONS, COMPANIES ARE GOING TO HAVE\nTROUBLE. SO IT MIGHT EVEN BE GOOD.\nTHEN LET'S GO TO OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES WHERE THIS MODEL\nREALLY WORKS. YOU KNOW, CHINA FIRST QUARTER\nYOU HAVE 36% OVER A YEAR AGO. AND I THINK SECOND QUARTER 14.\nIT'S CHOPPY. IT'S GOING TO BE DOWN AND UP.\nBUT IT'S STILL GOING UP. AND THAT'S GOING AROUND THE\nWORLD. SO YOU'VE GOT A MODEL THAT I\nTHINK WORKS. AND IF I'M WRONG, I'M WRONG.\nI'M NOT HERE TO SELL HERBALIFE. BUT I AM TELLING YOU THAT I'M\nNOT JUST PLAYING GAMES BUYING THE STOCK.\nI THINK IT WORKS. I CAN CHANGE MY MIND.\nBUT I WOULD TELL YOU THIS. THAT I ALSO LOOKED, BECAUSE I'M\nA MARKET SPECIALIST, AS I TOLD JANET McCABE'S SECRETARY, AND I\nTHINK I KNOW MARKETS. AND AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, I\nTHINK NO ONE THAT -- I DON'T WANT TO SAY IT IN A BAD WAY\nABOUT ACKMAN. BUT NO PROFESSIONAL WOULD REALLY\nWANT TO BE SHORT A COMPANY WHERE YOU'VE GOT 92 MILLION SHARES\nOUTSTANDING AND 28 MILLION SHORT, AND OF THOSE 92 --\n>> AND WE'VE BEEN LISTENING TO CARL ICAHN, SPECIFICALLY\nADDRESSING HIS LONG POSITION IN HERBALIFE, WHICH IS THE OPPOSITE\nPOSITION, OF COURSE, AS BILL ACKMAN.\nAND HE ALMOST MADE A DIG AT ACKMAN, SAYING NO PROFESSIONAL\nWOULD TAKE SUCH A LARGE CONCENTRATED SHORT POSITION.\n>> SOMETHING -- SO HE DID THE SAME THING AT HIS COMPANY\nCONSECO 15, 20 YEARS AGO. >> SO IF YOU RECALL -- A GUY\nNAMED IRWIN JACOBS, REALLY HOLD OLD-SCHOOL, TOOK THE OTHER SIDE\nOF IT. THIS IS JUST HISTORY REPEATING\nITSELF, EXCEPT NOW HE'S ON THE OTHER SIDE.\nI KNOW THAT, CARL. YOU'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL WHAT\nYOU SAY. GOOD JOB.\n>> BUT I THINK HE BRINGS UP JUST IN TERMS OF TRADING AND\nINVESTING, RIGHT? THE POINT HE'S WRITING  BRINGING\nUP, IT'S ABOUT POSITION SIZING AND WHAT YOUR PORTFOLIO LOOKS\nLIKE. LET'S SAY YOU LIKE APPLE.\nYOU DON'T WANT APPLE TO BE 90% OF YOUR PORTFOLIO.\nIT MAY HAVE WORKED THE LAST COUPLE YEARS, BUT IF YOU MANAGE\nMONEY YOU WANT TO HAVE A DIVERSIFICATION OUT THERE AND\nYOU DON'T WANT TO BE 90% OF YOUR PORTFOLIO SHORT ONE STOCK OR\nLONG ONE STOCK. >> WHAT DO YOU SAY?\n>> THAT IS HOW HE RUNS HIS BUSINESS.\nHE BUCKETS THESE THINGS, CREATES VERTICALS AND GOES ALL-IN, AND\nDID IT IN TARGET. AND SO THIS IS WHAT HE'S DOING.\nTHEY DO A LOT OF DEEP DIVE RESEARCH.\nHE KNOWS -- HE FEELS IT IN HIS YOU KNOW WHATS, THAT THIS THING\nIS GOING MUCH, MUCH LOWER. >> I THINK IT'S LOWER.\n>> BONES. >> THAT'S WHAT I MEANT.\nAND SO -- HERE'S THE THING ABOUT ICAHN.\n>> BY THE BONES. >> AND THEREFORE, THERE IS NO\nREASON FOR HIM TO GET OUT.

EVENTUALLY IT HAS TO GET TO ANOTHER PLACE.\n>> I WAS WONDERING IF BEEPER GOIWE\nWERE GOING TO DISCUSS THIS, BUT INTERESTING AS A WOMAN.\nI WAS TALKING TO MY MOM ABOUT THE WEEKEND.\n>> GOOD FOR YOU FOR TALKING TO YOUR MOM.\n>> I LIKE THAT. >> AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE\nELECTION AND I SAID THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN ADMITTED THEY HANDLED\nIT POORLY AND SHE SAID, YEAH, MAYBE THEY DID HANDLE IT POORLY\nBUT WHAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND IS A WOMAN, IS WE GET UP AND GO TO\nWORK BECAUSE WE HAVE MOEUTHS TO FEED EVEN WHEN WE'RE SICK AND\nFOR ME IT MADE -- AND WE IN THE NEWS MEDIA SAID IT MADE HER SEEM\nMORE HUMAN. >> I GET A LOT OF THAT ONLINE,\nTOO. >> DO YOU THINK THIS COULD END\nUP IN A WEIRD WAY, HELPING HER APPEAR MORE HUMAN WHEN SHE'S\nALWAYS SO SORT OF PREDICTABLE AND CAREFUL?\n>> I THINK THAT THAT IS -- >> AMONG WOMEN.\n>> -- WHAT THE HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN WOULD LIKE AND CLEARLY\nYOUR MOTHER FEELS THAT WAY AND I'VE HEARD FROM LOTS OF WOMEN\nWHO FEEL THAT WAY AND AS A WOMAN I KNOW WE GET UP EVERY DAY AND\nWE PLOW THROUGH, WHETHER WE'RE SICK OR OUR KIDS ARE SICK, OR\nWHATEVER. HOWEVER, THE PROBLEM WASN'T THE\nFACT SHE PLOWED THROUGH. >> IT WAS THE WAY THEY HANDLED\nIT? >> EXACTLY.\nAND IT PLAYS INTO A PREEXISTING NARRATIVE OF SECRECY, WHICH\nCOMES FROM THE WHOLE E-MAIL QUESTION.\n>> SO THE ANSWER TO THAT WAS, AS A WOMAN, HOW MUCH DO I HAVE TO\nGIVE IF I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, WHICH IS A VERY TOUGH\nTHING TO DO, DO I HAVE TO TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS?\nDO I HAVE TO TALK ABOUT MY WOMANLY ISSUES.\n>> DO YOU REMEMBER THE HEALTH RECORDS?\n>> YEAH, SHE TALKED ABOUT HER HEALTH RECORDS AND WHY A WOMAN\nWOULDN'T WANT TO NECESSARILY REVEAL THOSE THINGS.\n>> WHEN YOU'RE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT YOU BUY INTO THOSE\nTHINGS. >> THAT'S WHAT YOUR COLUMN SAID\nYESTERDAY. >> YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND\nNOTHING IS SECRET WHETHER YOU ARE A MAN OR WOMAN, IT'S PART OF\nTHE DEAL, AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE IF YOU'RE A CANDIDATE BECAUSE\nTHERE'S STUFF THAT'S GOING TO BE EMBARRASSING, BUT IT'S KIND OF\nPART OF THE PACKAGE. >> IT IS, AND IT'S ALWAYS THE\nCOVER UP. >> TELL YOUR MOM, IF YOU'RE\nWATCHING. >> SHE'S WATCHING, I'M SURE.\n>> YOU'RE PARTLY RIGHT. >> BUT DO YOU KNOW, DON, TO CAP\nIT, TOO IF BEE WE DIDN'T HAVE T VIDEO --\n>> THAT SAID IT. >> -- THAT SHE COLLAPSED, HAD\nTHEY JUST TOLD THE MEDIA SHE WASN'T FEELING WELL AND WAS\nGOING TO CHELSEA'S HOUSE, THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN TOTALLY\nDIFFERENT. >> AND HOW ABOUT ON FRIDAY SHE\nHAS A GRUELING SCHEDULE AND SHE'S GOING TO TAKE IT EASY AND\nSENDS HER REGARDS. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER BUT MY\nMOM SAID SHE'S A WOMAN AND SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED\nEITHER WAY SHE DIDN'T SHOW UP, SHE WASN'T PATRIOTIC.\n>> WE ALL GO TO WORK WHEN WE'RE NOT FEELING GREAT.\n>> MY MOM HAS AN ANSWER FOR EVERYTHING.\n>> SHE DOES, SHE DOES. >> I THINK I LOVE YOUR MOM.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS, BECAUSE I THOUGHT THIS WAS\nFASCINATING. I LOVE HER, TOO AND I LOVE YOU,\nAS WELL. SO LISTEN, THIS WAS FASCINATING\nTO ME TODAY BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN HEARING FROM THE TRUMP SIDE\nTHAT ECONOMY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PESS\nPESSIMISM, RIGHT, THE ECONOMY WE'VE HEARD AT THE CONVENTIONS\nIT'S BAD AND WHATEVER. THE PRESIDENT ALSO TALKED ABOUT\nTHE ECONOMIC NEWS TODAY, MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME IS UP 5.2% TO\n$56,516, AND THE FIRST ANNUAL INCREASE SINCE THE GREAT\nDEPRESSION, THE LARGEST INCREASE SINCE 1967.\nHOW MUCH DOES THAT HELP HILLARY CLINTON, IF AT ALL?\n>> IT DOESN'T HURT HER CAUSE BUT THE FACT WE CAN CITE NUMBERS --\nTHE CAN CITE NUMBERS DURING THE CAMPAIGN SPEECH, BUT PEOPLE ARE\nFEELING MALAISE, THEY STILL DON'T FEEL GREAT WHERE THEY'RE\nAT. THEY SEE WHAT HAPPENED TO WELLS\nFARGO WITH THESE BIG BANKS CREATING THESE BANK ACCOUNTS TO\nTRY TO PAD EVEN MORE MONEY INTO THEM.\nLISTEN, THE BARACK OBAMA, WHAT HE'S DONE TO HELP TURN THE\nECONOMY AROUND HAS BEEN VERY GOES AND HAS BEEN MISINTERPRETED\nAND FRANKLY YOU KNOW, ALIGNED BY REPUBLICANS.\nBUT THE FACT IS PEOPLE STILL, AT THIS POINT IN THE STATES WE WERE\nTALKING ABOUT, PENNSYLVANIA, OHIO, IN THE MIDWEST, IN THESE\nSTEEL-BELT STATES THEY STILL FEEL LIKE THEY'RE LEFT BEHIND.\n>> AND THE LAG, THE SORT OF NUMBER --\n>> SURE. PEOPLE FELT LIKE THEY HAVEN'T\nHAD A RAISE BASICALLY IN 15 YEARS AND THAT HURTS AND SHE\nCAN'T SAY THINGS ARE ROSY. SHE HAS TO SAY, WE'RE GOING TO\nDO BETTER. >> YEAH, SO LET'S TALK ABOUT\nTHINGS THAT I THINK ARE ROSY -- NOT NECESSARILY ROSY BUT IT'S\nACTUALLY GOOD. YOU HAVE AN EXCELLENT\nDOCUMENTARY AIRING TOMORROW AT THE P.M. CALLED \"ALMOST\nPRESIDENT, THE AGONY OF DEFEAT.\" YOU TALKED TO THE MEN WHO CAME\nREALLY CLOSE TO HAVING THE MOST POWERFUL JOB IN THE WORLD SO\nTELL US ABOUT THAT. >> WELL, IT WAS SUCH AN\nINTERESTING STORY TO REPORT TO TALK TO THESE MEN WHO WERE ON A\nPUBLIC STAGE. YOU CAN THINK OF A FAILURE MORE\nPUBLIC THAN RUNNING FOR THE PRESIDENCY AND LOSING?\nI REALLY EYE -- I REALLY CAN'T. SO WITH THE BENEFIT OF A LITTLE\nBIT OF TIME, POLITICIANS ARE NOT REFLECTIVE OF PEOPLE.\nTHESE PEOPLE SAT BACK AND SAID THIS IS WHAT IT'S LIKE AND THIS\nIS WHAT IT FELT LIKE TO LOSE AND THEY WENT THROUGH THEIR\nCAMPAIGNS AND ADMITTED THEIR MISTAKES, WHICH WE HARDLY EVER\nHEAR FROM CANDIDATES WHAT THEY DID WRONG, WHAT HURT THEM, AND\nHOWEVER COMING OUT OF IT, TO A PERSON EACH ONE OF THEM, NO\nMATTER HOW THEY SUFFERED, AND THEY ALL DID.\nMITT ROMNEY IN THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO WIN.\n>> HE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO WIN.\nYOU CAN COMPLETE THAT THOUGHT? I WANT TO PLAY THIS.\nLET'S PLAY A CLIP FROM IT. >> OKAY.\n>> TAKE THE SHOT. THE PERFECT TITLE FOR THE STORY\nOF JOHN McCAIN'S RUN FOR THE WHITE HOUSE.\nCHAPTER ONE, PICK A VICE PRESIDENT.\nHE KNEW EXACTLY WHO HE WANTED. >> YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE RUSSIA\nFROM LAND HERE IN ALASKA. >> NO, NOT HER.\nHIM. >> JOHN McCAIN, OUR NEXT GREAT\nPRESIDENT. >> MCCAIN'S FIRST LOVE WAS\nSENATOR JOE LIEBERMAN OF CONNECTICUT, AN INDEPENDENT.\n>> HIS HONESTY, HE'S DECENT, HE",

WE'VE ALREADY MET A HIGH\nSTANDARD OF TRANSPARENCY. WE KNOW THE LEAST ABOUT DONALD\nTRUMP OF ANY CANDIDATE IN RECENT AMERICAN HISTORY.\nKNOW VIRTUALLY NOTHING ABOUT HIS BUSINESS ENTANGLEMENTS, HIS\nFOREIGN INVESTORS. IT'S REALLY PAST TIME FOR HIM TO\nBE HELD TO THE SAME STANDARD NOT JUST AS ME BUT OF EVERYBODY ELSE\nWHO HAS SOUGHT THIS JOB. >> OKAY.\nSO WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING A LOT ABOUT TRANSPARENCY THIS\nMORNING. DONALD TRUMP HAS RELEASED FOUR\nPARAGRAPHS ON HIS MEDICAL RECORDS.\nSHE'S RELEASED TWO PAGES. IS THIS ENOUGH?\nWHAT DO VOTERS -- >> WELL, THEY DIDN'T COME FROM\nTRUMP. THEY CAME FROM THE DOCTOR.\n>> THAT'S RIGHT. WHO SAID HE'S IN ASTONISHING\nHEALTH. WE'LL GET TO ALL OF THAT.\nDONALD TRUMP, MEANWHILE, TAKING IT EASY ON CLINTON'S HEALTH, BUT\nHE IS POUNCING ON HER BASKET OF DEPLORABLES COMMENT, SAYING SHE\nHAS CONTEMPT FOR VOTERS. MIKE PENCE REFUSES TO CALL DAVID\nDUKE DEPLORABLE. SUNLEN SERFATY IS LIVE.\n>> Reporter: THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN TRYING TO KEEP THE SPOTLIGHT\nFOCUSED SQUARELY ON HILLARY CLINTON'S GAFFE.\nTRUMP ELEVATING THIS REALLY ONE STEP FARTHER LAST NIGHT AT HIS\nRALLY. HE CALLED UP A GROUP OF\nSUPPORTERS ON THE STAGE TO GIVE TESTIMONIALS AS IT WHY THEY\nTHINK THEY ARE NOT DEPLORABLE. HERE'S TRUMP LAST NIGHT.\n>> AFTER MONTHS OF HIDING FROM THE PRESS, HILLARY CLINTON CAME\nOUT AND FINALLY TOLD THE WORLD HOW SHE FEELS ABOUT THE PEOPLE\nOF THIS COUNTRY. SHE SAID TENS OF MILLIONS OF\nPATRIOTIC AMERICANS ARE A BASKET OF DEPLORABLES.\nHOW CAN YOU BE PRESIDENT -- HOW CAN YOU BE PRESIDENT FOR SO MANY\nPEOPLE? SHE TALKS ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE\nTHEY'RE OBJECTS, NOT HUMAN BEINGS.\n>> NOW, THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN TRIES TO GO ON THE OFFENSIVE ON THIS.\nHIS RUNNING MATE MIKE PENCE IS REALLY CAUSING THEM TO HAVE TO\nPLAY SOME DEFENSE. PENCE GETTING A LITTLE HEAT FOR\nHIS INTERVIEW YESTERDAY ON CNN WHEN HE WAS ASKED ABOUT SOME OF\nTHE SUPPORT THEIR CAMPAIGN HAS ATTRACTED FROM WHITE\nNATIONALISTS, INCLUDING FROM DAVID DUKE, A FORMER KKK LEADER.\nWELL, PENCE DISAVOWED DAVID DUKE'S SUPPORT, BUT HE REFUSED\nTO CALL HIM DEPLORABLE. HERE'S WHAT HE TOLD WOLF\nBLITZER. >> I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHY THE\nMEDIA KEEPS DROPPING DAVID DUKE'S NAME.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS DENOUNCED DAVID DUKE REPEATEDLY.\nWE DON'T WANT HIS SUPPORT, AND WE DON'T WANT THE SUPPORT OF\nPEOPLE LIKE HIM. >> SO YOU WOULD CALL HIM A\nDEPLORABLE? >> I'M NOT IN THE NAME CALLING\nBUSINESS, WOLF. YOU KNOW ME BETTER.\n>> Reporter: AND THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS POUNCED ONLY THAT,\nTWEETING OUT, QUOTE, IF YOU WON'T SAY THE KKK IS DEPLORABLE,\nYOU HAVE NO BUSINESS RUNNING THIS COUNTRY.\nSO THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN THERE, ALISYN AND CHRIS, CLEARLY\nSENSING SOME SMALL OPENING. >> OKAY.\nTHANKS SO MUCH FOR ALL OF THAT. LET'S DISCUSS IT WITH OUR PANEL.\nWE HAVE CNN'S SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST AND SENIOR EDITOR FOR\n\"THE ATLANTIC, RON BROWNSTEIN. GREAT TO HAVE ALL OF YOU HERE.\nRON, WHAT DO VOTERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW?\nDO THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW IF ONE OF THE CANDIDATES IS\nSUFFERING FROM PNEUMONIA? >> I THINK THEY HAVE THE RIGHT\nTO KNOW MORE THAN THEY KNOW. IT'S EXTRAORDINARY DECISION BY\nHILLARY CLINTON TO DECIDE ON FRIDAY AFTER DIAGNOSIS OF\nPNEUMONIA THAT, THAT DID NOT MEET THE STANDARD OF SOMETHING\nTHE PUBLIC SHOULD KNOW. AS ALWAYS, ON MANY FRONTS IN\nTHIS CAMPAIGN, HER BEST COMPARISON IS WITH DONALD TRUMP,\nWHO'S PROVIDED US WITH LESS INFORMATION BOTH ABOUT HIS\nHEALTH AND MORE EGREGIOUSLY ABOUT HIS TAXES THAN ANY\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE EVER BEFORE.\nWE HAVE TWO OF THE OLDEST CANDIDATES THAT HAVE EVER RUN\nFOR PRESIDENT. THERE SHOULD BE MORE RATHER THAN\nLESS DISCLOSURE. JOHN McCAIN BENT OVER BACKWARDS\nTO PROVIDE MEDICAL RECORDS IN 2008.\nI THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE UNQUESTIONABLE PRESSURE FOR THEM\nTO GIVE US MORE THAN THEY HAVE SO FAR, BUT IT WON'T BE AS MUCH\nAS MANY ARE HOPING. >> EXCUSE IS THE SYSTEM.\nTHERE ARE NO RULES THAT COMPEL ANYTHING MORE THAN THEY WANT TO\nDO. WE CAN PRESSURE THEM TO DO.\nI HOPE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE REALIZING WHEN THEY SAY THEY\nWANT TO KNOW MORE, THAT'S WHAT EMPOWERS THE MEDIA.\nTHERE'S THIS FICTION RIGHT NOW THAT SOMEHOW THE MEDIA HAS ITS\nOWN INDEPENDENT POWER. WE'RE ONLY AS GOOD AS WHAT THE\nPEOPLE WANT. IN YOUR REPORTING, WHAT HAVE YOU\nENCOUNTERED IN TERMS OF TRYING TO GET DISCLOSURE ONFOUNDATION.\nTHE PUSHBACK TO HER POINT IS NOBODY'S BEEN MORE TRANSPARENT\nTHAN ME. YEAH, BUT YOU HAVE TO BE\nINVESTIGATED FOR THE TRANSPARENCY TO COME OUT.\nNOW WITH TRUMP, WHAT'S BEEN YOUR EXPERIENCE?\n>> THEY'RE TRYING TO FOCUS SO MUCH ON HOW DONALD TRUMP ISN'T\nPUTTING OUT INFORMATION RATHER THAN HITTING A STANDARD THAT\nOTHER PREVIOUS PRESIDENTS AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES HAVE\nMET. ONE OF THE BIG DEBATES THAT\nTHEY'VE HAD IN THE CAMPAIGN IS WHETHER TO PUT HER DOCTOR ON THE\nPHONE WITH REPORTERS, WHETHER TO PUT OUT ALL OF THE SORT OF\nMEDICAL RECORDS, THE PAGES THAT, YOU KNOW, JOHN McCAIN, JOHN\nKERRY, AL GORE, GEORGE W. BUSH PUT OUT AND SORT OF CREATE, GIVE\nVOTERS A SENSE OF THE PHYSICAL HEALTH OF THE CANDIDATE.\nWHAT THEY'RE COMING BACK AGAINST, I THINK, IS HER DESIRE\nFOR PRIVACY, FOR PUTTING OUT AS LITTLE INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE,\nYOU KNOW, WHICH HAS BEEN A PATTERN OF SECRETARY CLINTON'S\nGOING BACK TO THE '90s. >> ZELENY REPORTED THAT HER OWN\nSTAFF, SOME OF THEM DIDN'T KNOW SHE HAD PNEUMONIA.\n>> DIDN'T KNOW. WE DID A LOOK THIS MORNING,\nGOING BACK AND LOOKING AT THE DECISION MAKING.\nSHE FOUND OUT FRIDAY MORNING SHE HAD THIS DIAGNOSIS OF PNEUMONIA\nAND DECIDED TO KEEP THE INFORMATION TO A REALLY TIGHT\nCIRCLE OF FAMILY MEMBERS, CLOSEST AIDES, PEOPLE WHO FOR\nYEARS AND DECADES IN SOME CASES HAVE KIND OF REINFORCED HER\nINSTINCT FOR PRIVACY, FOR HUNKERING DOWN BECAUSE OF THE\nBELIEF THAT INFORMATION CAN SO EASILY BE MANIPULATED BY\nCONSPIRACY THEORISTS, PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AGAINST HER.\n>> THIS IS ALSO JUST HER PERSONALITY.\nSHE DOESN'T OVERSHARE. SHE DOESN'T SHARE SITUATION\nOTHER PEOPLE WOULD. SHE SAID IN THAT INTERVIEW WITH\nANDERSON, I THOUGHT I WOULD JUST MUSCLE THROUGH IT.\nTHAT'S SORT OF A METAPHOR FOR HOW SHE'S HANDLED A LOT OF\nTHINGS IN LIFE. >> IT WASN'T A BIG DEAL TO HAVE\nANOTHER DEVICE WHEN SHE HAD HER E-MAILS.\nIT WASN'T A BIG DEAL NOT TO TELL PEOPLE SHE HAD PNEUMONIA UNTIL\nTHEY GET CAUGHT, UNTIL THERE BECOMES A COMPELLING REASON FOR\nTHESE THINGS TO BE OUT THERE. THAT'S WHY THERE'S THIS TRUST\nDEFICIT WITH HILLARY CLINTON. THIS WHOLE INCIDENT, ALL THE\nHEALTH CONCERNS ASIDE, JUST MADE PEOPLE REMEMBER THAT AGAIN, WHY\nTHEY MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO TRUST HILLARY CLINTON.\n>> LET'S SWITCH OVER TO TRUMP HERE.\nDO WE HAVE THE SOUND OF TRUMP TALKING ABOUT WHAT CLINTON SAID\nABOUT VOTERS? >> I THINK WE DO.\nLET'S PLAY THAT. >> I ASK YOU BECAUSE YOU KNOW.\n>> SHE CALLED THESE AMERICANS EVERY NAME IN THE BOOK.\nRACIST, SEXIST, XENOPHOBIC, ISLAMOPHOBIC.\nSHE SAID THEY WERE NOT EVEN AMERICAN.\nRIGHT. ANYBODY XENOPHOBIC?\nI DON'T THINK SO. I DON'T THINK SO.\nNEVER IN HISTORY HAS A MAJOR PARTY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SO\nVICIOUSLY DEMONIZED THE AMERICAN VOTER.\n>> RON, EXCEPT FOR HIM. WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?\n>> SOMETIMES IT'S JUST LIKE SOMETHING SCREAMS OUT BS ALERT.\n>> THIS IS WHERE DONALD TRUMP KIND OF CHALLENGES CONVENTIONAL\nJOURNALISM. WHEN YOU SAY SOMETHING THAT IS\nJUST SIMPLY THAT SEPARATED FROM THE FACT, THIS IS A CANDIDATE\nWHO CAME DOWN THE ESCALATOR AND TALKED ABOUT UNDOCUMENTED\nIMMIGRANTS AS RAPISTS, WHO SAID THAT A U.S.-BORN FEDERAL JUDGE\nCOULD NOT DO HIS JOB PRECISELY BECAUSE OF HIS ETHNIC HERITAGE.\nIT IS EXTRAORDINARY FOR HIM TO BE SAYING THAT, YOU KNOW, SHE'S\nTHE UNIQUE LY DEMONIZING LARGE GROUP OF AMERICANS.\n>> XENOPHOBIC IS FEAR OF OUTSIDERS.\n>> IN POLLING, THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT THE DONALD TRUMP\nCOALITION IS MUCH MORE HOSTILE TO THE IMPACT -- HE'S A MUCH\nMORE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF IMMIGRANTS.\nALWAYS A MISTAKE FOR A CANDIDATE TO ATTACK THE MOTIVATIONS OF\nPEOPLE. THERE ARE LOTS OF REASONS WHY\nPEOPLE ARE NOT VOTING FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nIT'S WRONG TO SIMPLY ATTRIBUTE IT TO KIND OF, YOU KNOW, BAD\nMOTIVES. BUT IT IS NOTEWORTHY THAT FOR\nTHIS MODERN DEMOCRATIC COALITION, DIVERSITY, TOLERANCE,\nINCLUSION ARE CORE VALUES. IN THIS DISPUTE, SHE IS\nPORTRAYING HERSELF AS SOMEONE WHO WILL STAND UP FOR THAT.\nIN THE SAME WAY THIS MOTIVATES THE TRUMP COALITION, I THINK IT\nALSO MOTIVATES THE CLINTON COALITION.\n>> THIS IS ALSO THE PLACE WE'RE HOPING TO GET THE TRUMP/PENCE\nTICKET INTO, WHICH WAS NOT FOCUS ON THE HALF THE VOTERS BUT ON\nTHE DEPLORABLES SO THEY HAVE TO END UP DEFENDING OR LOOK LIKE\nTHEY'RE DEFENDING PEOPLE LIKE DAVID DUKE.\nTHIS WAS SORT OF THE IDEA OF LIKE, OKAY, DONALD TRUMP, MIKE\nPENCE STAND UP FOR THE VOTERS WHO ARE SUPPORTING YOU, DEFEND\nWHAT THEY SAY, WHAT THEY DO. >> THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE\nDEMOCRATIC PARTY AND HILLARY CLINTON WANT TO CAST A BIG TENT\nFOR ALL OF THEM, EXCEPT REPUBLICANS, WHO SHE SAYS ARE\nDEPLORABLES. HERE'S MY QUESTION.\nWAS THAT INTENTIONAL, OR DID SHE MISSPEAK?\nTHERE'S A BIG DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER THAT IS THE MESSAGE THAT\nSHE'S TRYING TO SEND OUT TO EVERYONE.\nWE DON'T EVEN WANT THEM. WE DON'T LIKE THEM.\nOR WAS THAT JUST SHE JUST WENT OVERBOARD.\n>> IT SEEMS LIKE SHE DOESN'T WANT PEOPLE TO FEEL LIKE THEY'RE\nASSOCIATED WITH THE DEPLORABLES. SHE DOESN'T WANT PEOPLE TO WANT\nTO BE PART OF THAT CLUB. I WOULD \u00e2\u0096\u00a0ISAGREE THATSHE\nDOESN'T WANT REPUBLICANS. THEY'VE ACTUALLY TRIED TO\nRECRUIT, PARTICULARLY ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS, WHO\nHAVE BEEN RAGING AGAINST TRUMP THIS ENTIRE TIME.\n>> MY POINT IS, IS THAT THE WAY TO DO IT?\nCALL HALF OF DONALD TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS --\n>> NO, BECAUSE THIS COULD AFFECT THE BLUE-COLLAR VOTERS THAT HER\nHUSBAND AND JOE BIDEN HAVE BEEN WORKING SO HARD TO RECRUIT.\nIN PLACES LIKE PENNSYLVANIA, OHIO, IN THE RUST BELT.\nIF THEY HEAR THIS OUT OF CONTEXT, THEY COULD BE LISTENING\nTO TRUMP AND THINKING HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH.\n>> AS JACKIE NOTED, THE FLIPSIDE IS IN REALITY, THEIR SURER PATH\nTO VICTORY IS THROUGH THOSE WHITE-COLLAR SUBURBS.\nI THINK SHE WENT TOO FAR AND PHRASED IT IN A WAY THAT'S\nUNNECESSARILY POLARIZING AND OFFENSIVE TO VOTERS.\nI THINK AS JACKIE WAS SUGGESTING, THEY WANT THOSE\nVOTERS TO QUESTION WHETHER THIS IS A POOL YOU REALLY WANT TOP\nJUMP IN. IS THIS WHERE YOU SEE YOURSELF\nCUL CULTURALLY, OR DO YOU FEEL\nALIENATED FROM IT. AS YOU KNOW IN POLLING, TODAY\nSHE'S AHEAD AMONG COLLEGE EDUCATED WHITE VOTERS, WHICH NO\nDEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HAS EVER WON IN THE\nHISTORY OF POLLING. >> WE ALSO KNOW THE ANSWER TO\nYOUR QUESTION IS, YES, IT WAS INTENTIONAL, BECAUSE SHE HAD\nSAID THIS BEFORE ABOUT THE NATURE AND CHARACTER OF SOME OF\nHIS SUPPORTERS. THE 50% WAS NEW.\nTHAT WAS THE MISTAKE. SHE OVERREACHED.\n>> PANEL, STICK AROUND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\n>>> SO BILL CLINTON AND MIKE",

JOINING ME, CARL BERNSTEIN,\nAUTHOR OF \"A WOMAN IN CHARGE,\" AND DAVID GERGEN, SENIOR ADVISER\nTO FOUR PRESIDENTS, INCLUDING BILL CLINTON.\nDAVID, HILLARY CLINTON MAKES THE POINT THAT SHE'S GIVEN OUT MORE\nINFORMATION ABOUT HER HEALTH AND TAXES THAN DONALD TRUMP HAS, AND\nYET, THERE IS STILL THAT SENSE THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE THAT SHE\nIS NOT AS TRANSPARENT AS THEY WOULD LIKE HER TO BE.\nDO YOU THINK THAT'S FAIR? >> I DO THINK THAT SHE'S ADDED A\nLOT OF FUEL TO THAT FIRE OVER THE YEARS.\nTHIS IS -- YOU KNOW, SHE'S NOT A NEWCOMER TO THE SCENE.\nAND THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF EXAMPLES IN THE PAST.\nGOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE WHITE WATER CASE, WHERE SHE'S\nHAD A REAL PENCHANT FOR SECRECY, OTHERS, THE \"FINANCIAL TIMES,\"\nSAYS AN ADDICTION TO SECRECY. AND IT BAFFLES HER FRIENDS.\nAND I'VE WORKED FOR HER AND AMONG HER AND I'M AMONG THOSE\nWHO ARE BAFFLED, BECAUSE THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARILY SMART WOMAN,\nWHO IS VERY MUCH ON TOP OF THE ISSUES, CARES DEEPLY ABOUT THE\nWAY GOVERNMENT RUNS. WANTS TO BE A GOOD MODEL.\nAND YET, IN THIS AREA, SHE CAN -- SHE'S MADE THE SAME\nMISTAKE OVER AND OVER. AND IT'S BAFFLING.\n>> CARL, DO YOU THINK IT'S JUST THAT SHE'S BEEN, YOU KNOW,\nBRUISED, AND HAS BEEN IN THE PUBLIC EYE FOR A LONG TIME, AND\nHAS GROWN WARY OVER THE YEARS, AS ANYONE --\n>> I THINK THIS IS HER REAL ILLNESS.\nTHAT THIS IS A PATTERN THAT GOES BACK, AS I SAY IN MY BOOK, SHE'S\nHAD A DIFFICULT RELATIONSHIP TO THE TRUTH, GOING BACK TO HER\nDAYS IN ARKANSAS. SHE DOESN'T TRUST THE PRESS, HER\nCONSTITUENTS, ANYONE, WITH THE REAL, WHOLE PICTURE.\nSHE THINKS SHE HAS TO CONTROL INFORMATION AND NOW IT IS\nWORKING AGAINST HER TO THE POINT WHERE SHE COULD LOSE THIS\nELECTION. AND I HAVE SAID, IT'S TIME FOR\nHER TO PUT EVERYTHING OUT THERE. PUT THE GOLDMAN SACHS SPEECHES\nOUT THERE, PUT HER HEALTH RECORDS OUT THERE, SIT DOWN WITH\nA DOCTOR AND THE PRESS FOR AN HOUR.\nBECAUSE THE OTHER PART OF THIS STORY IS THAT DONALD TRUMP IS A\nCON MAN. HE HAS BEEN COVERING UP HIS\nWHOLE BUSINESS LIFE, NOT JUST THROUGH THIS CAMPAIGN.\nIT IS A HUGE COVER-UP. WE HAVE SEEN \"THE WALL STREET\nJOURNAL,\" \"THE WASHINGTON POST,\" \"THE NEW YORK TIMES,\" GREAT\nREPORTING ABOUT THE COVER-UP OF DONALD TRUMP'S BUSINESS\nACTIVITIES. >> YOU KNOW, DAVID, TO CARL'S\nPOINT, THOUGH, WE STILL DON'T HAVE DETAILED MEDICAL RECORDS\nFROM DONALD TRUMP. YOU KNOW, WE HAD THIS SORT OF\nODD, TO SAY THE LEAST, DOCTOR'S NOTE SAYING THAT HE WILL BE THE\nHEALTHIEST PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD, OR IN THE\nHISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. WE STILL DON'T KNOW REALLY\nANYTHING ABOUT HIS TAX RETURNS, EVEN THOUGH HIS 2002 TO 2008\nRETURNS, THE AUDIT ON THEM, ACCORDING TO HIS OWN ATTORNEYS\nIS FINISHED, AND SO IF THE ARGUMENT IS, WELL, I CAN'T\nRELEASE MY CURRENT TAX RETURNS BECAUSE OF AN AUDIT, THERE IS NO\nAUDIT ON THE PREVIOUS ONES, SO WHY NOT RELEASE THOSE?\n>> I THINK DONALD TRUMP IS ON AN OUTRAGEOUS COURSE AND HE'S BEEN\nMUCH LESS FORTHCOMING THAN HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN.\nCARL BERNSTEIN IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT ON THAT.\nTHE LAST NINE REPUBLICAN NOMINEES FOR THE PRESIDENCY HAVE\nDISCLOSED THEIR TAX RETURNS. THE LAST NINE GOING BACK TO\nRONALD REAGAN IN 1980. EVERY SINGLE ONE.\nIT IS A TRADITION THAT IS FOLLOWED BY THE DEMOCRATIC\nPARTY, AS WELL. AND IT'S MORE IMPORTANT FOR\nTRUMP'S CASE THAN ANYBODY ELSE'S, BECAUSE HE'S RUNNING\nENTIRELY AS A BUSINESSMAN. AND THE SUCCESS OF HIS BUSINESS,\nAND HE WON'T LET US UNDERSTAND THE NUMBERS TO BACK UP HIS\nCLAIMS. HE'S BEEN REALLY GENEROUS WITH\nCHARITABLE -- CHARITIES. HE SAYS, LET'S SEE THE NUMBERS.\nLET'S SEE WHAT HE'S BEEN PAYING OUT IN TAXES.\nLET ME MAKE ONE OTHER POINT. NOW THAT HE'S COMING FORWARD\nWITH HEALTH RECORDS, IT'S BEWILDERING TO GET THIS REPORT\nTHAT HE'S GOING TO DO WITH DR. OZ.\nI MEAN, TALKING ABOUT A WAY TO TRIVIALIZE THIS SUBJECT, AND\nPOLITICALLY, I THINK IT'S A MISTAKE, BECAUSE HE'S HAD\nHILLARY CLINTON ON THE DEFENSIVE HERE FOR ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES,\nAND NOW HE'S GOING TO MAKE -- IF THAT'S THE KIND OF COURSE HE'S\nGOING TO PURSUE ON HIS HEALTH RECORDS, HE'S GOING TO BRING THE\nISSUE BACK TO HIMSELF AND HE'S GOING TO BE ON THE DEFENSIVE.\n>> ALTHOUGH, YOU COULD MAKE THE ARGUMENT, CARL, THAT, YOU KNOW,\nDR. OZ PROBABLY REACHES AN AUDIENCE, PREDOMINANTLY WOMEN,\nDAYTIME TELEVISION VIEWERS, AND THAT MAY BE JUST WHO DONALD\nTRUMP MENEED TO REACH. >> LOOK, \"THE APPRENTICE\" HAS\nGOT HIMSELF TO THIS POINT BY DOING THIS TYPE OF TELEVISION.\nI'M NOT AT ALL SURE THAT THIS IS A BIG MISTAKE FOR DONALD TRUMP,\nTO DO THIS. IN THE MEDIUM OF REALITY\nTELEVISION. WE NEED, I THINK, IS A LITTLE\nLESS EQUAL TIME DEBATE, PARTICULARLY ON CABLE TELEVISION\nRIGHT NOW. AND A LITTLE MORE LOOKING AT\nWHAT THE UNDERLYING FACTS ARE HERE OF BOTH DONALD TRUMP AND\nHILLARY CLINTON'S LIFE. SIDE BY SIDE.\nAND I THINK THEN WE BEGIN, AND OUR READERS AND VIEWERS BEGIN TO\nGET AN IDEA OF WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE NEXT TO EACH OTHER IN TERMS\nOF THE LIVES THEY HAVE LED, THE BUSINESSES THEY HAVE RUN, THE\nPUBLIC SERVICE THEY HAVE DONE, OR HAVEN'T DONE.\nWHAT THEIR REAL VALUES ARE. THEN, I THINK, WE HAVE A BASIS\nAND PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE A MUCH BETTER BASIS TO MAKE A\nDECISION ABOUT VOTING FOR ONE OF THESE CANDIDATES.\n>> AND DAVID, THIS LACK OF TRANSPARENCY.\nI MEAN, WHAT KIND OF CONSEQUENCES DO YOU THINK THIS\nHAS? NOT JUST IN THIS ELECTION, BUT\nMOVING FORWARD, JUST IN TERMS OF GOVERNANCE.\nDOES IT HAVE A RAMIFICATION? >> I THINK BOTH CANDIDATES ARE\nMOVING ALONG A TRACK, THEY'RE MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR\nTHEMSELVES TO GOVERN IF THEY WIN.\nIT IS IMPORTANT, IF YOU'RE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,\nTO BUILD UP TRUST IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, SO WHEN YOU SAY\nSOMETHING CONTROVERSIAL, OR WHEN YOU TRY TO TAKE A CONTROVERSIAL\nACTION, THEY WILL HAVE FAITH IN YOU THAT YOU'RE TELLING THEM THE\nTRUTH AND THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GO ALONG WITH YOU MORE EASILY.\nWHEN DWIGHT EISENHOWER WAS PRESIDENT, IT WAS SAID, WHEN HE\nTOOK A POSITION, 20% OF THE PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY\nAUTOMATICALLY AGREED WITH HIM, BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED IN HIM.\nTHEY HAVE ABSOLUTE FAITH IN HIS INTEGRITY.\nAND THIS QUESTION OF INTEGRITY GOES SO FAR IN A SOCIETY WHERE\nLEADERSHIP IS BASED ON PERSUASIVE BS AND INFLUENCE, NOT\nON REAL POWER, BUT ON YOUR CAPACITY TO BRING OTHERS ALONG,\nTRUST IS THE COIN OF THE REALM. IT'S BEEN THAT WAY FOR YEARS,\nBUT EVEN MORE SO",

              "text": ">>> GUYS, THANKS SO MUCH.\nWELCOME TO \"THE HALFTIME REPORT.\"\nI'M SCOTT WAPNER LIFE TODAY FROM CNBC. SIXTH ANNUAL DELIVERING ALPHA\nCONFERENCE TODAY IN NEW YORK CITY.\nCARL ICAHN TO RAY DALIO ARE SHARING THEIR IDEAS RIGHT HERE.\nWITH US FOR THE HOUR JOE TERRA NOVA, JOSH BROWN, AND STEVEN\nWEISS. MARKETS, AS YOU KNOW, ARE HAVING\nA VERY DIFFICULT DAY. THE DOW HAS BEEN DOWN ABOUT 250\nPOINTS. DOW AND THE S&P LOOKING AT THEIR\nFOUR OUT OF FIVE DOWN DAYS NOW. THERE'S THE DOW DOWN CURRENTLY\n246. THE S&P AND THE NASDAQ AND THE\nRUSSELL, WHICH IS DOWN 2% TAKING A LITTLE BIT HARDER TODAY.\nGIVE YOU A CHECK ON OIL AND GOLD AND BONDS TOO.\nTHERE'S SO MUCH CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT THE FED MAY DO.\nEVEN HERE AT DELIVERING ALPHA HAVE YOU HEARD FROM SOME OF THE\nLARGEST AND MOST RESPECTED MONEY MANAGERS IN THE WORLD WITH THEIR\nCOMMENTARY ON THE FED AND THE MARKETS.\nWE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT. ALSO WORD TODAY THAT ATLANTA FED\nPRESIDENT DENNIS LOCKHART IS STEPPING DOWN FROM HIS POST IN\nFEBRUARY. THAT IS BIG NEWS.\nTHAT'S WHY WE HAVE SENIOR ECONOMICS REPORTER STEVE LIESMAN\nJOINING US ON SET AS WELL. LET'S DISCUSS WHAT'S TAKING\nPLACE IN THE MARKET. IT'S BEEN AN INTERESTING FEW\nDAYS. JOSH, VOLATILITY IS BACK, AND IT\nIS BACK IN A BIG WAY. >> NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.\nYOU HAD THESE GIANT BULLISH CANDLES EVERYWHERE YESTERDAY.\nWE HAD ERASED ALL OF THE LOSS, AND IN SOME AREAS WE WERE\nACTUALLY GAINING FROM THURSDAY NIGHT'S CLOSE.\nWHEN YOU SEE THAT KIND OF ACTION AND THEN THE NEXT DAY IT'S\nCOMPLETELY NEGATED AS THOUGH IT NEVER HAPPENED, THAT TELLS YOU\nSOMETHING BIG IS GOING ON. WE LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF THESE\nKINDS OF MINUS ONE, PLUS ONE, MINUS ONE AGAIN DAYS NEAR\nALL-TIME HIGHS. THIS HAS ONLY HAPPENED FIVE\nTIMES. I DON'T KNOW 100% WHAT IT MEANS,\nBUT WHEN YOU SEE THE TLT LOOKING AWFUL BACK INTO THE POST-BREXIT\nGAP, AND YOU SEE VAN GARDE REAL ESTATE DOWN 8.5% FROM THE HIGHS,\nYOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS AS A RATE-RELATED ADJUSTMENT BECAUSE\nTHE CUES, THE GROWTH STOCKS, ARE HANGING IN MUCH BETTER THAN THE\nYIELD PROXIES. >> IT MEANS BUCKLE UP.\nI MEAN, INVESTORS, JOE, NEED TO BUCKLE THEIR SEAT BELTS, PUT\nTHEIR SHOULDER STRAP ON. I MEAN, MAYBE IF YOU ARE A RACE\nCAR DRIVER, YOU NEED TO HARNESS IN TOO BECAUSE IT COULD GET EVEN\nMORE VOLATILE FROM HERE. >> I DESCRIBED YESTERDAY AS A\nTRADING EVENT, AND WE'VE NOW GRAVITATED TOWARDS IF YOU ARE A\nMONEY MANAGER, YOU NEED TO BE PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT'S GOING\nON TODAY. IF YOU DID NOT LIKE FRIDAY, YOU\nDO NOT LIKE TODAY. I THINK THE PROBLEM WAS WAKING\nUP THIS MORNING AT 4:30 AND LOOKING AT THE ASIAN MARKETS AND\nSEEING THEM REALLY GIVE UP THE STRONG GAMES.\nTHERE WAS NO REBOUNDS OVERSEAS. PEOPLE REALLY DON'T WANT\nEQUITIES UNLESS THEY'RE DOMESTICALLY FOCUSED.\nTHAT'S WHERE I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A PROBLEM GOING FORWARD.\nWE'RE IN A VACUUM PERIOD. THE RIGHT STRATEGY IS TO RAISE\nCASH LEVELS RIGHT NOW. YOU TAKE YOUR EQUITY HOLDINGS\nBACK. PROBABLY SOMEWHERE AROUND 20% IN\nCASH. YOU HAVE TO CLEARLY PAY\nATTENTION TODAY. AS I SAID YESTERDAY, IT WAS A\nTRADING EVENT. I THINK I MIGHT BE WRONG ABOUT\nTHAT. I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING BIGGER\nTHAT'S DEVELOPING HERE. BILL MILLER WAS ON THE STAGE\nLESS THAN FIVE MINUTES AGO SAYING THAT HIS BEST IDEA RIGHT\nNOW IS LONG THE S&P 500 AND SHORT TREASURIES.\nYET, YOU'VE HEARD OTHER OPINIONS FROM THE LIKES OF PAUL SINGER\nAND RAY DALIO PERHAPS. WE'LL HEAR FROM THEM IN A\nMOMENT. YOUR THOUGHTS FIRST.\n>> THAT WAS SURPRISING. JOSH AND I WERE BOTH STANDING\nTHERE WATCHING BILL MILLER, AND I THINK HE WERE WITH BOTH\nSURPRISED THAT THAT WAS HIS BEST IDEA TO COME OUT.\nNOT THE OTHER SIDE. NOT THE SELL BONDS SIDE, BUT THE\nS&P SIDE. I THINK WHAT PAUL SINGER CAME\nOUT AND SAID WAS MUCH MORE TYPICAL OF WHAT I HAVE HEARD IN\nMY CONVERSATION AND OTHER CONFERENCES I HAVE BEEN AT,\nWHICH IS HIS BEST IDEA WAS TAKE RISK OFF.\nSELL G-7 LONG DURATION BONDS. I'VE DONE WHAT JOE HAS\nSUGGESTED, WHICH I MENTIONED YESTERDAY.\nI'VE TAKEN CAPITAL OFF. ONE OF MY CONCERNS HAS BEEN\nCOMPLACE ENSY IN THE MARKETS, AND I THINK WE'RE SEEING THAT\nCOMPLACE ENSY COME OUT AGAIN TODAY.\nIF YOU HAD ASKED ME YESTERDAY AFTER BRAINERD CAME OUT AND\nTRIED TO THROW COLD WATER ON IT, I WONDER IF YELLIN PUT HIM UP ON\nIT OR NOT, I HAVE TAKEN DOWN MY ODDS OF A TIGHTENING LATER THIS\nMONTH. I STILL THINK IT WILL HAPPEN.\nI WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE MARKET WOULD HAVE HAD SOME\nFOLLOW-THROUGH TODAY. HOWEVER, WE'RE BACK TO THE\nCORRELATION WITH CRUDE. CRUDE SELLS OFF MEANINGFULLY\nOVER 3%, AND THE MARKET TAKES A DIVE.\nI THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO POINT TO.\nTHE OTHER THING -- I THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT -- IS THAT YOU\nCAN'T DISASSOCIATE POLITICS AND THE POLLS GETTING TIGHTER AND\nHILLARY NOW BECOMING -- YOU KNOW, THE PNEUMONIA WITH WHAT'S\nHAPPENING IN THE MARKETS. IT'S BECOMING MORE OF A REALITY.\nI THINK THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO DRIVE THE VOLATILITY AND\nCONTINUE TO DRIVE IT THROUGH ELECTIONS.\n>> WE'VE REFERENCED PAUL SINGER A COUPLE OF TIMES NOW.\nWE MIGHT AS WELL LISTEN TO THE SOUND THAT HE HAD TODAY.\nOF COURSE, THE FAMED HEDGE FUND MANAGER HAD ALREADY SAID THAT\nWE'RE IN THE MIDST OF THE BIGGEST BOND BUBBLE IN HISTORY,\nBUT HERE'S WHAT HE SAID ABOUT HOW HE VIEWS THE WORLD RIGHT\nNOW, AND A DANGEROUS ONE AT THAT.\n>> WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IS CREATED A TREMENDOUS INCREASE IN\nHIDDEN RISK. A RISK THAT INVESTORS DON'T\nEXACTLY KNOW OR HAVE FACED ABOUT THEIR HOLDINGS, AND I THINK IT'S\nA VERY DANGEROUS TIME IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND GLOBAL\nFINANCIAL MARKETS. >> THAT'S PAUL SINGER RIGHT\nTHERE. I GOT STEVE LIESMAN NEXT TO ME\nTOO. THEY BEING IN PART, THE FED.\nNOT JUST THE FED, BUT CENTRAL BANKS AROUND THE WORLD.\nTHE ACTIONS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE, IT'S JUST A DANGEROUS\nTIME RIGHT NOW GIVEN THE THREAT OF PULLING THAT AWAY.\n>> TREASURIES ARE NOT THE RISK-FREE ASSET, AND THAT\nCREATES -- >> SAFE HAVENS AREN'T SUCH.\n>> THERE'S NO SAFE IN THE HAVEN THERE OR NO HAVEN IN THE SAFE.\nIT CREATES A GROUNDLESS INVESTMENT MATRIX IN THAT ALL\nINVESTMENTS ARE JUDGED FROM THE RISK-FREE RETURN.\nIT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO KNOW IF STOCKS ARE OVER OR UNDER VALUED\nRELATIVE TO WHAT COULD BE A VERY POTENTIALLY VOLATILE MOVEMENT IN\nLONG BONDS WHEN IT COMES TO THE YIELD.\nWHAT TROUBLES ME, THOUGH, IS I THINK SINGER IS A LITTLE BIT\nMORE PESSIMISTIC THAN HE OUGHT TO BE IN THAT I THINK THAT MORE\nOR LESS, THE RETURNS ON THE TEN-YEAR ARE AT LEAST TO A 70 OR\n80% DEGREE DETERMINED BY THE MARKET.\nIF THE FED WERE TO STOP REALLY TRYING TO KEEP INTEREST RATES\nDOWN, I DON'T THINK THEY WOULD SKYROCKET TO 3%.\n>> ONE OF THE POINTS THAT HE MADE WAS THAT YOU COULD HAVE\nBOTH STOCKS AND BONDS FALLING TOGETHER, AND THAT WOULD BE A\nREVERSAL OF WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON NOW WHERE STOCKS AND BONDS HAVE\nGONE UP. >> AND THEN THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT\nCENTRAL BANK POLICIES HAVE DONE. IT HAS MADE A MONEY MANAGER VERY\nUNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE YOU ARE TAKING CORRELATIONS BACK TO\nWHERE EVERYTHING IS CLOSE TO ONE.\nEVERYTHING GOES UP TOGETHER. EVERYTHING GOES DOWN TOGETHER\nLIKE IT IS TODAY. THAT'S THE PROBLEM LOOKING\nFORWARD BECAUSE YOU LOSE THE HEDGING OPTIONS.\nIT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON TODAY IN\nOIL AND THINK ABOUT LAST WEEK. WHERE WE ARE ON THURSDAY WITH\nTHE NUMBER THEY CAME OUT AND EVERYONE SAYING, OH, LOOK AT\nOIL. THE BIGGEST DRAWDOWN SINCE 1999,\nGOING THROUGH 50. EVERYONE POSITIONED THE WRONG\nWAY. BRINGING IN THE CORRELATION TO\nONE. >> I ALWAYS PUZZLE OVER IT, ASK\nAPPROXIMATE PEOPLE SAY, OH, THEY GET IT.\nTO ME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE GREED TRADE AND THE FEAR TRADE\nARE SIMULTANEOUSLY OVERVALUED. YOU HAVE A TON OF PEOPLE WHO\nHAVE PILED INTO BONDS IN PART BECAUSE THEY'RE SCARED OF\nSTOCKS, THEY'RE SCARED OF THE FUTURE.\nTHEY'RE LOOKING FOR A RISK-FREE ASSET.\nAS A RESULT, THEY'VE CREATED A NON-RISK-FREE ASSET, AND VERY\nFEW PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO GO WITH THE STOCKS.\n>> I DON'T KNOW IF I AGREE IT'S A NONRISK-FREE ASSET.\nWHEN PEOPLE USE THE BLANKET TERM TREASURIES, WHAT ARE WE TALKING\nABOUT? T-BILLS ARE ACTING AS A RISK-OFF\nRIGHT NOW. THEY'RE DOING THEIR JOB.\nIF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 20-YEAR PLUS, NO, YOU SHOULDN'T EXPECT\nTHAT TO BE THE RISK-FREE IF, IN FACT, LONG-TERM BOND YIELDS ARE\nAT THE FOCAL POINT OF WHAT PEOPLE ARE PANICKING OVER.\n>> LET'S MAKE IT ACTIONABLE THEN.\nIF YOU CAN'T INVEST IN STOCKS BECAUSE THEY LOOK EXPENSIVE AND\nTHEY COULD GO DOWN IF THE FED HIKES AND YOU MAY NOT WANT TO\nINVEST IN BONDS BECAUSE YOU ARE AFRAID THAT THEY GO DOWN AND\nRATES COULD GO UP IF THE FED HIKES, WHAT DO YOU DO?\n>> YOU ENDURE -- LISTEN, YOU ENDURE SOME DEGREE OF SHORT-TERM\nVOLATILITY. IT'S THE ONLY ANSWER.\nTHE OTHER ANSWER IS YOU TRY TO MARKET TIME WITHIN AN ENTIRE\nPORTFOLIO, WHICH YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO.\n>> ONE OF THE THINGS YOU CAN DO IS YOU COULD PLAY FOR VOLATILITY\nTO INCREASE, BUT, AGAIN, THE THING THAT IS MAKING EVERYONE\nUNCOMFORTABLE RIGHT NOW IS AS A MONEY MANAGER, HOW DO YOU LAY\nOFF YOUR RISK? THAT'S THE FIRST MANDATE YOU\nHAVE WHEN YOU ARE MANAGING MONEY.\nYOU ANALYZE YOUR RISK. HOW DO I LAY OFF MY RISK?\nTHAT'S THE CHALLENGE FOR YOU RIGHT NOW BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DO\nIT USING THE HISTORICAL ASSET CLASSES.\nYOU CAN'T DO IT LAYING OFF ON THE CURRENCY MARKET OR LAYING IT\nOFF IN TREASURIES. YOU CAN LOOK AT VOLATILITY RIGHT\nNOW. >> IT ALSO DEPENDS WHAT YOUR\nBASIS IS, TAX BASIS IS. YOU CAN'T GO TO CASH IF YOU HAVE\nA LOW TAX BASIS AND PAY TAXES. FOR NEW CAPITAL, I COULD WAIT\nFOR -- >> I WANT TO REPRESENT BECAUSE\nWHAT SCOTT LEFT OUT OF HIS EQUATION THERE, WHICH HAS TO BE\nPART OF THE CONVERSATION IS YOU CAN'T GO INTO STOCKS BECAUSE --\nYOU ALSO CAN'T BE IN CASH. YOU LOST ALL OF THE RETURN.\nLET ME EXPLAIN. THIS IS IMPORTANT.\nFOR EIGHT OR NINE YEARS IF YOU HAD THIS PESSIMISTIC VIEW ON HOW\nIT WAS ALL GOING TO END UP WITH THE FED, YOU LOST A LOT OF\nMONEY. YOU ARE WELL BEHIND THE CURVE\nBECAUSE OF THAT REAL FEAR THAT YOU HAD, AND I THINK THAT\nREMAINS AN ISSUE. >> THIS CONVERSATION IS NOT\nABOUT SHOULD YOU GO INTO EQUITIES.\nIT'S IF YOU ARE IN EQUITIES, WHAT DO YOU DO NOW?\nMOST OF OUR VIEWERS AND MOST OF THOSE HERE TODAY, THEY'RE FULLY\nINVESTED IN EQUITIES THEY'VE BEEN ENJOYING THIS SEVEN-YEAR\nRIDE HIGHER. WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THAT?\n>> THERE ARE THOSE -- ON THAT POINT I WAS GOING TO SAY PEOPLE\nLIKE CARL ICAHN AND THIS WHOLE NOTION OF TINA.\nTHERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE. HIS THING IS THAT'S MALARKEY.\nYOU COULD BE IN CASH. BEING IN CASH IN A LOW RATE\nENVIRONMENT IS BETTER THAN LOSING IN EQUITY.\nIF THE MARKET IS GOING TO HAVE AN ASYMMETRIC DISLOCATION, THEN\nBEING IN CASH IS OKAY. >> THE MAJORITY OF INVESTORS\nALREADY AGREE TO THAT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT FLOWS, WHEN YOU\nLOOK AT WHERE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES, FINANCIAL\nADVISORS, PLANNERS, WHERE ARE THEY ALLOCATING, THEY'RE NOT\nTHROWING MONEY AT THE SPY. THEY'RE IN VARIOUS STRATA OF\nBOND PRODUCTS. PRIME FUNDS, SHORT-TERM\nTREASURIES, ET CETERA. NOBODY THINKS NOW IS THE TIME TO\nBE 100% STOCKS. >> THERE'S NO SIZE FITS ALL.\nIT DEPENDS ON YOUR AGE, YOUR RISK TOLERANCE, YOUR VOLATILITY\nTOLERANCE. >> LET ME GET TO THE OTHER NEWS\nOF THE DAY, AS IF IT'S AN AFTERTHOUGHT, WHICH IT'S NOT,\nAND THAT'S DENNIS LOCKHART. >> THIS IS A PROFOUND\nCONVERSATION. THIS REALLY GETS AT THE HEART OF\nTHE QUANDRY OF INVESTMENT. PART OF BEING A D.A. HERE --\n>> LOCKHART IS LEAVING IN FEBRUARY.\n>> LOCKHART IS LEAVING IN FEBRUARY.\nHE IS A CENTRIST ON THE BOARD. ONE OF THE FEW NON-ECONOMISTS\nOUT THERE. THERE'S NO TIMETABLE TO APPOINT\nHIM. WE'RE GOING TO LEARN A LITTLE\nBIT MORE ABOUT THE PROCESS IN OCTOBER.\nI GUESS IT'S A COUPLE OF WEEKS FROM NOW.\nLOCKHART HAS BEEN AT THE FED SINCE 2007.\nHE IS A GUY I HAVE KNOWN FOR A VERY LONG TIME.\nA GUY WHO YOU FOLLOW WHEN YOU WANT TO KNOW IF IT'S A CLOSE\nDECISION. IF DENNIS IS LEANING TOWARDS A\nHIKE, IT'S LIKELY GOING TO BE A HIKE BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE A",

NASDAQ GIVING UP 56.\nDOWN ABOUT 1.1% TO 5155. WE WILL HAVE MORE ON ALL OF THIS\nPLUS MOVES ON OIL AND BONDS. IT IS ANOTHER BUSY HOUR FROM\nDELIVERING ALPHA. WE WILL SPEAK TO BILL MILLER\nLIVE FROM THE CONFERENCE AND STEVE SCHWARZMAN AND CARL ICAHN\nBOTH SET TO TAKE THE STAGE LATER THIS HOUR.\nJOINING ME ON THE PANEL TODAY WE HAVE SENIOR MARKET COMMENTATOR\nMIKE SAN THOLE HERE. WELCOME, GUYS.\nFOR MORE ON TODAY'S MARKET ACTION THERE IS SO MUCH TO GET\nHERE. WHAT DO YOU THINK IN A NUT SHELL\nHAS HAPPENED? >> CONTINUING FROM FRIDAY IS\nTHIS BACK UP IN BOND YIELDS WE HAVE HAD GLOBALLY.\nIT IS GIVING A LITTLE BIT OF A SHOCK TO THE PREMISE OF A LOT OF\nSTOCK OWNERSHIP. LOWER FOR LONGER WITH RATES.\nIT ALLOWS YOU TO PAY MORE. IT ALLOWS YOU TO JUSTIFY HIGHER\nVALUEUATIONS. THAT IS THE IMMEDIATE OVERLAY OF\nWHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING HERE. ONCE YOU HAVE THAT BUYER STRIKE\nI DON'T THINK IT IS MOSTLY ABOUT THE FED.\nTHE FED IS LOOKING TOWARDS DECEMBER.\nIT IS JUST ABOUT WHY OUR BOND INVESTORS ARE GETTING COLD FEET.\nWE HAVE NOT MADE NET PROGRESS SINCE JULY 8.\nDOESN'T MEAN IT IS THE WHOLE STORY.\nTHAT IS WHAT I THINK UPSET THE STOCK SIDE.\n>> ANOTHER FASCINATING DEVELOPMENT THAT MAYBE PLAYS\nINTO THIS, MAYBE IT DOESN'T. WE FOUND OUT IN 2015 THAT\nHOUSEHOLD MEDIAN INCOME DROPPED 5%.\nMEDIAN IS A LITTLE BIT LOWER. POINT BEING YOU HAVE ACTUALLY\nVERY GOOD NEWS ABOUT WAGES. MAYBE IT'S ENOUGH TO KEEP GOING.\nMAYBE IT IS JUST ENOUGH FOR PEOPLE TO THINK THE BOND MARKETS\nARE MISPRICED. >> IT IS A LITTLE BIT BACKWARD\nLOOKING. IT TELLS YOU IT IS NOT JUST THAT\nWAGES ARE UP. THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD THINGS.\nIT WIPLAY INTO THE CAMPAIGN. YOU HAVE TO ASSUME MAYBE AMERICA\nISN'T AS BAD AS MR. TRUMP SAYS IT IS.\nIT WILL HELP CLINTON. GOING BACK TO TODAY'S MARKET\nTHERE IS NOTHING, NO SINGLE THING YOU CAN SAY THAT IS WHAT\nFREAKED US OUT. IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN HANG IT ON\nNORTH KOREA BLOWING SOMETHING UP.\nIF ANYTHING YOU CAN PROBABLY SAY IT IS BECAUSE YOU HAD THESE\nAMAZING PEOPLE AT YOUR PANEL TODAY.\nI WAS WATCHING SO MANY OF THESE BILLIONAIRE INVESTORS KIND OF\nREALLY WORRIED MORE THAN THEY WERE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT WHAT IS\nGOING ON. I DON'T KNOW -- I DON'T KNOW\nTHAT PLAYED INTO IT. >> WE CAN SHOW A CHART OF THE\nTEN YEAR, GUY. CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT YOU THINK.\nIT IS ONE THING TO KNOW THERE ARE THESE BEARS OUT THERE.\nANOTHER THING TO HEAR PAUL SINGER MAKE A CASE FOR WHY THE\nPARADIGM MIGHT BE SHIFTING HERE. >> I HAVE BEEN, AS YOU KNOW, I\nHAVE BEEN A STEADFAST BOND BULL FOR QUITE SOME TIME.\nYOU CAN'T BE DOGMATIC IN VIEWS. IF THE MARKET STARTS TO TELL YOU\nSOMETHING HAS CHANGED YOU SORT OF HAVE TO LISTEN TO IT.\nLAST WEEK WE FOUND OUT MAYBE THE ECB DOESN'T HAVE THE MARKETS\nBACK. I THINK PEOPLE SORT OF PUSH PAST\nTHAT. SOMEBODY LIKE JAMIE DIMON SAYING\nTHE FED WILL LOSE -- UNDERSTANDING THAT HE HAS A\nVESTED INTEREST FOR HIS COMPANY HE SAID HE THOUGHT THE FED WOULD\nLOSE CREDIBILITY IF THEY DIDN'T RAISE RATES.\nNOW YOU HAVE THE VOICES TODAY TALKING ABOUT MISSTEPS IN THE\nFED AND ALL THINGS THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT.\nI THINK THAT IS WHAT LEADS YOU DOWN THIS PATH.\nI THINK TO MIKE'S POINT I DON'T THINK IT IS NECESSARILY A U.S.\nBOND MOVE. I THINK IT IS MORE PREDICATED ON\nWHAT IS GOING ON OVERSEAS. IT WILL DRAG U.S. RATES HIGHER,\nAS WELL. IN TERMS OF BROADER MARKET THIS\nIS JUST SORT OF THE -- THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IN THE WAKE OF WHAT\nWE ARE SEEING. THAT BOND MOVEMENT FROM THE LOWS\nWE SAW 135 TO NUMBERS WE ARE SEEING NOW PERCENTAGE WISE IS A\nPRETTY STAGGERING MOVE. >> SO THE QUESTION IS WHEN IT\nCOMES TO BRING US BACK TO THE STOCK MARKET WHICH IS SELLING DO\nYOU BUY THE DIPS WHICH HAS BEEN THE RIGHT STRATEGY TO THIS\nPOINT? PEOPLE BLINK AND MISS THE SELL\nOFFS AND THEN WE CONTINUE TO RECOVER AND MOVE HIGHER.\nDO YOU DO THAT AGAIN OR SIT OUT AND THINK THIS TIME SOMETHING IS\nDIFFERENT. >> I'M NOT BREAKING ANY NEWS\nHERE. THE ENTIRE WAY UP I HAVE BEEN\nSKEPTICAL AND ALL ALONG I HAVE SAID MY SKEPTMISM.\nEVERY PULL OFF WE HAVE SEEN IN THE LAST SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS\nHAS BEEN A BUYING OPPORTUNITY. IS THIS GOING TO BE THE\nDIFFERENT ONE? I WISH I WAS SMART ENOUGH TO\nANSWER THAT QUESTION. I WILL SAY THE LONGER THE MARKET\nSTAYS BELOW THE 2,135 LEVEL IN THE S&P THE MORE CAUTIOUS I\nBECOME. I THINK A HUGE LEVEL WILL FIND\nITSELF AT 2050. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR CRITICAL\nSUPPORT THAT IS WHERE IT COMES. IF YOU CONTINUE TO SEE THESE\nPRETTY AMAZING MOVES IN BOND MARKETS GLOBALLY AGAIN THAT\nUNCERTAINTY DOESN'T LEND ITSELF TO A STABLE STOCK MARKET IN MY\nOPINION. >> IT WAS INTERESTING THIS\nHAPPENED ON A DAY -- THIS IS MUCH-ANTICIPATED EVENT OF THE\nWEEKEND. SHE WAS DOVISH WHICH IS CONTRARY\nTO WHAT WAS BUILT UP TO BE. SHE COMES OUT AND INSTEAD HAS A\nVERY DOVISH MESSAGE. IS THAT LOST?\nDO PEOPLE NOT CARE? DOES IT NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO\nWITH WHY BONDS ARE SELLING -- >> I THINK IT WAS A FACTOR\nYESTERDAY TO THE REBOUND. I THINK TODAY WE WOKE UP TO THE\nWALL STREET SAYING YOU HAVE A CONFLICTED FED NOT LIKELY TO\nMOVE IN SEPTEMBER. IF I'M JUST TRYING TO PUT THE\nMARKET ON THE COUCH A LITTLE BIT IT DEFINITELY FEEDS INTO THE\nIDEA THAT HAS BEEN BUILDING UP THAT CENTRAL BANKS ARE FATIGUED.\nTHEY DON'T THINK THE MARGINAL ADVANTAGE OF DOING ANYTHING MORE\nTHAN THEY HAVE DONE IS REALLY THERE.\nSO THAT IS TO ME WHERE IT FITS IN.\nNOT SO MUCH RATES ARE GOING UP ON US BUT WE JUST DON'T KNOW.\nI THINK STOCKS NEED A NEW STORY IF THEY ARE GOING TO GO HIGHER.\nIT IS NOT JUST ABOUT LOWER FOR LONGER.\n>> GOOD PLACE TO SWITCH GEARS. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.\n>> LATER. >> THERE IS MUCH MORE COMING UP\nAT FAST. CARL ICAHN WILL BE TALKING\nEVERYTHING FROM THE ECONOMY TO FED AND MARKETS.\nTHAT WILL BE HAPPENING WITHIN THE NEXT HOUR.\nBILL MILLER SPOKE EARLIER TODAY SHARING HIS BEST IDEA FOR THE\nMARKET. HE SAID HE IS LONG THE S&P AND\nSHORT TEN YEAR. WITH US TO EXPLAIN WHY IS BILL\nMILLER, CHAIRMAN AND CIO OF LMN, LLC.\nWELCOME. ASSUMING YOU HEARD SOME\nCONVERSATION WE WERE HAVING EXPLAIN THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE\nFED AND HAVING CONFIDENCE IN THE FED OR ANTICIPATING THEIR NEXT\nMOVES FITS IN WITH YOUR BEST IDEA HERE TO GO LONG STOCKS AND\nSHORT BONDS. >> BEING SHORT BONDS HAS BEEN A\nTERRIBLE TRADE FOR THE LAST 35 YEARS.\nI THINK THAT RIGHT NOW IT'S PROBABLY A GOOD TIME TO PUT THAT\nTRADE ON. AND THE REASON I SAY THAT IS\nTHAT YOU ARE IN A PERIOD NOW WHERE INTEREST RATES ARE ABOUT\nAS LOW AS THEY ARE GOING TO GO. WE HAVE SEEN A BACK UP IN GLOBAL\nYIELDS. MAYBE MOST IMPORTANTLY WE HAD AN\nINTERESTING THING TODAY HAPPEN WHICH IS FOR MOST OF THIS YEAR\nWHENEVER STOCKS SOLD OFF BONDS HAVE RALLIED.\nWE HAVE SEEN STOCKS SELLING OFF AND BONDS SELLING OFF.\n>> AND SO PAUL SINGER'S POINT WAS IF BOTH STOCK AND BOND\nPRICES ROSE TOGETHER DURING RECOVERY NOW THEY CAN BOTH FOLD\nTOGETHER. THAT MIGHT BE WHAT WE ARE\nSEEING. YOUR POINT OF VIEW YOU ARE\nSAYING BOND PRICES WILL FALL BUT YOU KEEP BUYING STOCKS.\n>> I THINK OVERALL VALUATIONS WHILE HIGH COMPARED TO HISTORIC\nNORMS THOSE NORMS WERE PERIODS WHERE AVERAGE BOND YIELD IS\nABOUT 6%. AVERAGE BOND YIELD IS 1.7% AND\nHAVE DIVIDEND GROWTH RATE AND WE CAN FIND REALLY GOOD VALUE IN\nTHE MARKET SHORT TERM CORRECTIONS IN THE MARKET REALLY\nI THINK ARE NOT TO BE TOO CONCERNED ABOUT.\n>> WHY IS THAT? MAKE THE CASE FOR SOMEBODY WHO\nHAS BEEN LISTENING TO THE TALK OF DELIVERING ALPHA OR\nCONTEMPLATING THIS MOVE WITH THE BOND MARKET AND SAYING IF YIELDS\nARE GOING HIGHER THAN STOCK PRICES MUST HAVE TO FALL LOWER\nAND MAYBE BE RE-VALUED. WHY DO YOU WANT TO BE LONG\nSTOCKS IN THIS ENVIRONMENT? >> I THINK IT IS A VALUATION\nCALL. IF YOU GO BACK 30 YEARS TO 1987\nSO SEPTEMBER 1987 THE MONTH BEFORE THE MARKET CRASHED YOU\nHAVE THE EXACT OPPOSITE SITUATION WHERE YIELDS HAVE BEEN\nRISING BUT STOCKS WERE CONTINUING TO RISE AND THE FED\nHAD BEEN TIGHTENING. THE 30-YEAR TREASURY YOU GOT TO\n10% IN OCTOBER OF '87. AND YET WHAT YOU HAD WAS STOCK\nMARKET GOES AROUND 18 TIMES EARNINGS AND WITH 3% YIELD.\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT STOCKS VERSUS BONDS IT MADE NO SENSE BECAUSE\nYOU HAVE 3% IN STOCKS AND DIVIDEND YIELD AND 5% GROWTH\nRATE WHICH MEANT YOU CAN ONLY MAKE 8% IN STOCKS WHERE TREASURY\nGAVE YOU 9% FOR 30 YEARS. SO THE VALUATION CASE WAS\nCOMPELLING. RIGHT NOW IT IS THE EXACT\nOPPOSITE WHICH IS IT IS HARD TO SEE.\nI THINK THE BOND MARKET MADE A DOUBLE TOP ONE IN 2012 AND THE\nOTHER JULY OF THIS YEAR. BONDS AROUND 135 LEVEL WITH BOND\nYIELDS THE LOWEST IN HISTORY AND STOCK VALUATIONS ARE CERTAINLY\nNOT DEMANDING COMPARED TO BONDS. IT IS VERY EASY TO SEE HOW A\nDECENT -- LONG TERM IT IS HARD TO SEE HOW IF YOU THREW A DART\nAND JUST CONTINUE TO HOLD IT YOU WILL GET 4% OR 5% GROWTH RATE IN\nDIVIDENDS. THAT WILL HAVE TO KILL BONDS.\n>> WHAT IS YOUR ANTICIPATION HERE?\nIS THIS PREDICATED ON THEY ARE GOING TO KEEP RAISING RATES?\nAT THIS POINT DOES IT MATTER WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY PULL A 180\nAND SAY FORGET IT? >> YOU KNOW, I THINK AT THE END\nOF THE DAY THE CENTRAL BANKS AROUND THE WORLD AT LEAST IN A\nRETHINK ABOUT THE ABILITY OF LOWER RATES TO MAKE ANY\nDIFFERENCE IN THE OVERALL ECONOMY.\nWHAT WE HAVE NOW IS THERE IS A MUCH DIMINISHED MARGIN OF\nUTILITY. THERE AREN'T PROJECTS ON HOLD\nBECAUSE RATES ARE TOO HIGH. WHAT IS HAPPENING IS IT IS\nPUTTING PRESSURE ON THE BANKING SYSTEM AND RAISING PRESENT VALUE\nOF LIABILITIES AND I DO THINK MAYBE MOST IMPORTANTLY THE U.S.\nECONOMY IS CHUGGING ALONG AT 1.5% TO 2%.\nTHAT IS FAST ENOUGH TO BRING DOWN THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE.\nWE ARE APPROACHING FULL EMPLOYMENT.\nYOU JUST -- ALL OF THAT WOULD TEND TO SAY YOU DON'T NEED\nEXTRAORDINARY ACCOMMODATION. REMOVING ACCOMMODATION SOME CALL\nIT TIGHTENING. AND I DOENGT HU IT CAUSES A LOT\nOF PROBLEMS FOR THE STOCK MARKET EXCEPT NEAR TERM AS MONEY GETS\nREALLOCATED. UNDERLYING VALUES DON'T REALLY\nCHANGE. >> MIKE SANTOLI.\nTHE FED CALLS IT REMOVAL OF ACCOMMODATION.\nIT SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE. TO YOUR POINT THAT YOU MENTIONED\nIN THE SHORT TERM WHEN YOU HAVE MARKETS ADJUSTING TO GENERAL\nRISE IN BOND YIELDS AS TREASURY MARKET PERHAPS SELLS OFF FURTHER\nOR TO THE FED DOING WHAT IT IS GOING TO DO.\nWHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR IN THAT ADJUSTMENT PROCESS?\nWHAT KINDS OF STOCKS SHOULD PERFORM WELL IN THAT\nENVIRONMENT? IS THAT WHAT TRADITIONAL GROWTH\nIS GOING TO DO BETTER? WHAT ARE YOU FINDING THAT IS\nCOMPELLING? FOR EXAMPLE, THOSE DEPENDENT ON\nTHE CREDIT MARKET, ARE THEY GOING TO BE OKAY, AS WELL?\n>> WE TEND NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT IN THE SENSE OF GROWTH DOING\nBETTER OR VALUE DOING BETTER. WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR IS WHERE\nPRICES OF INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES CHANGE FAR MORE THAN WARRANTED\nBY CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES OR DROP IN THE OVERALL MARKET.\nWE ARE TRYING TO LOOK FOR DISLOCATION AND VALUEUATION\nACROSS THE BOARD. IF THE YIELD CURVE IS SHIFTING\nUP THEN THAT IS GOOD FOR BANKS AND FINANCIALS AND CREDIT\nSENSITIVE NAMES. BUT BROADLY SPEAKING IT WOULD\nTEND TO BE GOOD FOR FINANCIALS. 100 BASIS POINT MOVE IN FED\nFUNDS RATE IS PROBABLY 4 TO $5 BILLION OF PRETAX EARNINGSISM WE\nCAN LOOK THERE. IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT LIKE A JP\nMORGAN WITH LOW PAYOUT RATIO. WE THINK THOSE CAN GROW FAR\nFASTER THAN THE MARKET. THEY ARE ABOVE MARKET.\n>> JUST A QUICK QUESTION. DO YOU HAVE -- WHAT ABOUT DEEP\nVALUE? I MENTION FINANCIALS DEUTSCHE\nBANK AT 30%. I LOOK AT THESE MORE DISTRESSED\nSITUATIONS LIKE",

HE SAID IN TERMS OF INVESTMENT\nRECOMMENDATIONS, HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY PARTICULARLY OBVIOUS ONES\nRIGHT NOW. BUT HE LIKES GOLD.\nHE THINKS IT'S UNDERREPRESENTED IN MANY PORTFOLIOS.\nLISTEN TO HIM ON THAT. >> IN TERMS OF DIRECTIONAL\nASSETS, I THINK GOLD IS UNDERREPRESENTED IN PORTFOLIOS\nAS THE ONLY MONEY AND STORE VALUE THAT HAS STOOD THE TEST OF\nTIME. THAT IS UNDER, IN MY VIEW --\nUNDERVALUED AND UNDERPRICED IN TODAY'S WORLD.\n>> SINGER ALSO SAID THAT HE THOUGHT EVERYONE SHOULD SELL G-7\nBONDS. HE DOES NOT LIKE LONG-TERM\nGOVERNMENT BONDS, NOT ONE BIT. HE THINKS THAT FURTHER TURMOIL\nCOULD BE TO COME AND HE DOESN'T LIKE THE LEVEL AT WHICH THIS\nDEBT IS TRADING. IN SOME CASES, AT NEGATIVE\nLEVELS, MELISSA, AS WE ALL KNOW. >> ALL RIGHT.\nKATE KELLY, THANKS SO MUCH. SO MUCH TO COVER OUT OF\nDELIVERING ALPHA TODAY AT CNBC. KAY KELLY.\nSO IN TERMS OF IDEAS HERE, A LOT WERE PRESENTED.\nWHAT DO YOU GRAVITATE THE MOST? >> I THINK THE IDEA OF SELLING\nG-7 BONDS. THAT TO ME IS MOST INTERESTING.\nI WOULD TAKE OUT THE U.S. I THINK THAT'S A BETTER RELATIVE\nVALUE TRADE. EVERYTHING ELSE, WITHOUT A\nDOUBT, IS IN A BUBBLE. WE'RE IN A BOND BUBBLE, NO\nQUESTION IN MY MIND ABOUT THAT. >> PETE?\n>> THE MOST INTERESTING THING FOR ME WAS BILL MILLER.\nALWAYS BEEN FAIRLY BULLISH. BUT HE POINTED OUT A COUPLE\nAREAS WHERE HE THOUGHT, FOR INSTANCE, THE AIRLINES.\nHE SAID THESE ARE INCREDIBLY CHEAP, ESSENTIALLY.\nTHIS IS A BUY HERE. WE'VE ALL THOUGHT THAT FOR A\nLONG PERIOD OF TIME. I'VE BEEN ONE OF THEM.\nINTERESTING TO HEAR THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT SO MUCH DEVASTATION\nIN THE MARKET OVER THE LAST COUPLE TRADING SESSIONS.\n>> JIM CHANOS, SHORT ON TESLA, WELL-KNOWN.\nSHORTING TESLA AND SOLARCITY. IS THAT A GOOD DEAL?\nIF THE DEAL FALLS APART, GREAT FOR THE SHORT POSITION, IT WOULD\nBE GREAT FOR TESLA. >> TIM WAS ARGUING LAST NIGHT ON\nTHE SHOW. IN THE SHORT TERM, TESLA MIGHT\nBOUNCE. FOR ME THE MOST INTERESTING\nTHING, QUICKLY, WAS PAUL SINGER TALKING ABOUT HOW GOLD IS\nUNDERREPRESENTED. I THOUGHT THAT WAS FASCINATING.\n>> ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO AROUND THE HORN.\nTHAT TIME OF THE SHOW. PETE.\n>> GREAT PAPER, THE STOCK HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY BLUDGEONED\nRECENTLY. BUT LULULEMON.\nGOING HIGHER. >> INTERESTING.\n>>. >> WE SAW A REVERSAL IN THE\nDOLLAR HIGHER TODAY. DIDN'T REALLY HAPPEN IN THE EURO\nAS MUCH. BUT THERE WERE SOME BIG MOVES\nTHERE.

WE'RE IN OZ.\nWHERE THE MARKETS ARE REALLY EXCITING WITH THE WILD GYRATIONS\nWE HAVEN'T SEEN IN AGEES. IT IS INDEED A HORSE OF A\nDIFFERENT COLOR WITH TODAY'S COLOR BEING VERY MUCH RED.\nDOWN TUMBLING 258 POINTS. NASDAQ WOULD HAVE BEEN LOWER IF\nIT WEREN'T FOR APPLE. WHAT HAPPENED?\nWHERE DID THE BORING DAYS GO TO? I THINK THEY WENT THE WAY\nSEPTEMBER ALWAYS SEEMS TO PLAY OUT.\nNINTH MONTH IN THE YEAR STATISTICALLY WORST MONTH OF THE\n12. ALWAYS SEEMS TO PLAY THE ROLE OF\nTHE WAKE-UP CALL. PEOPLE COME BACK FROM SUMMER,\nPARTICULARLY IN AN ELECTION YEAR, SURVEY THE LAND SKATE AND\nRECOGNIZE THERE IS MORE RISK THAN THEY THOUGHT.\nSURE, AVERAGES ARE UP MORE YEAR TO DATE.\nNASDAQ WITH A NEW HIGH JUST LAST WEEK BUT A NEW AND VERY PALPABLE\nSENSE OF GLOOM OUT THERE. ONE THAT WAS ECHOED TODAY AT\nCNBC'S DELIVERY ALPHA CONFERENCE.\nA MAJOR INVESTOR WHERE BIG MONEY SPEAKS HIS MIND AND THAT MIND\nWAS DEFINITIVELY, AND I CAN SAY THIS WITHOUT QUESTION, NEGATIVE.\nIN SOME WAYS I CAN'T DISAGREE. THOUGH I DO NOT, ON THE RECORD,\nDO NOT SHARE THE DEPTH OF DESPAIR OF SO MUCH OF THE\nSPEAKERS I HEARD TODAY. WE'RE STUCK IN A WEIRD MOMENT\nWHERE WHOEVER SPEAKS LAST, CAUSES GYRATIONS THAT ARE\nMAGNIFIED BY A MONTH THAT SO OFTEN ENDS THE COMPLACENCY OF A\nSUMMER RALLY. IF ONLY WAUZ THE PAIN IS BACK,\nTHE MOST PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THE PAIN IS JUST NOT WORTH THE GAIN.\nAGAIN, THIS MOMENT OF ANGEST IS UNDERSTANDABLE.\nTHINK OF THE MAJOR VARIABLES OUT THERE.\nFEDERAL RESERVE OFFICIALS EACH WITH THE TUNE OF DESPERATE AND\nUNELECTED VOICES WHO WIELD TREMENDOUS POWER OVER STOCK\nPRICES. WE OUGHT TO HAVE TRADING CARDS\nTO KEEP TRACK OF THEM SO WE KNOW WHO THE HECK THEY ARE.\nYOU KNOW WHAT? MY CRACK STAFF MADE THEM UP.\nWE KNOW FOR INSTANCE THAT FED CHIEF JANET YELLEN'S CARD HAS\nREAL VALUE. LIKE AN HONEST WAGGER.\nSAME FOR THE STANLEY FISHER CARD.\nSHE ARE POTENTIAL HALL OF FAMERS, HOFORS AS THEY CALL THEM\nAND THEY WANT TO GET HOME TO THE RATE HIKES.\nTHEN A WEEK AGO TUESDAY, JOHN WILLIAMS SAID HE WANTED A FED\nINCREASE SOONER RATHER THAN LATER.\nTO ME SOONER MEANS NEXT WEEK'S MEETING.\nON TOP OF THAT, WOW, HERE IS THE SHOCKER.\nLAST WEEK, ERIC ROSE ENBURG TURNED HAD MARKET UPSIDE DOWN.\nBY SUGGESTING IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA, A HAWK.\nPLACE FOR BOSTON. SWITCH FROM DOVE TO HAWK CRUSHED\nTHE MARKET EVEN AS DANIEL TARULLO MADE COMMENT TO MAKE HIM\nSOUND COOL TO A HIKE BUT THAT WASN'T A NEW POSITION TO THE\nHAWKISH STANCE CONTROLLED THE DAY AND PRECIPITATED THE 400\nPOINT DECLINE. THANKS FOR WATCH PL MAYBE HE WAS\nTHE REASON WHY THEY LOST SO BADLY LAST NIGHT.\nANYWAY, THEN YESTERDAY HOWEVER, FED GOVERNOR LYLE BRAINARD OF\nWASHINGTON ALONG WITH DENNIS LOCK HART OF ATLANTA AND NEIL\nCASHKARA OF MINNEAPOLIS WERE DOVISH SAYING THEY WANT IT KEEP\nTHE BATS ON THEIR SHOULDERS. EVEN IF IT DIDN'T MAKE UP FOR\nEVERYTHING IT LOST ON FRIDAY, HENCE THE NAME OF NEGATIVITY\nLAST NIGHT. FORTUNATELY THESE SPEAKERS WILL\nSHUT UP NOW THANKS TO SELF-IMPOSED LACKOUT AS WE HEAD\nINTO LAST WEEK'S FED MEETINGS. WITHOUT THEM, NOTHING TRADE-OFF\nOF. NO EARNINGS.\nNO IMPORTANT PRONOUNCEMENTS. NO, CHECK THAT.\nTHE INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY LAST MONTH ANNOUNCED THEY\nTHOUGHT THE BIG OIL GLUT WAS EASING.\nCAME OUT THIS MORNING AND SAID IT WASN'T EASY.\nOIL GOT HAMMERED MERCILESSLY. DOWN A BUCK 39.\nJUST BELOW $45 AGAIN. AND OPEC REDUCTION AND DECLINE\nOF 100,000 BARE AELS DAY AND TOOK OUT NEXT YEAR'S GROWTH AS\nWELL. 1.3 MILLION BARRELS A DAY STILL.\nKIBOSHING THE RALLY FROM YESTERDAY.\nAND THE MARKET TOOK A HEADER AS OIL PICTURES GOT A LOT PERKIER.\nAND I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T MENTION THE NEWS FROM\nWELLS FARGO THAT ISN'T EXACTLY REASSURING WHEN IT COMES TO\nPUTTING TRUST IN OUR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.\nHERE WE GO AGAIN. MORE ON THAT IN A MOMENT WHEN WE\nINTERVIEW CEO JOHN STUFF. THE MARKET TOOK ITS CUE FROM\nWELLS IN SOME WILEYS. NEVER MIND THE EARLY READ ON\nAPPLE'S. SO I SNEEZE.\nANYWAY, SORRY, TIM COOK, RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF WHAT I WAS\nSAYING ABOUT APPLE BUT APPLE'S NEW iPHONE WHERE T-MOBILE AND\nSPRINT SAID THE LAUNCH IS MUCH, MUCH BETTER THAN EXPECTED AND I\nHAVE BEEN CHECKING AROUND AND LET'S SAY VERIZON AND AT&T SEEM\nTO SEE A VERY SIMILAR DEMAND. WHAT DO YOU DO HERE?\nSOMETIMES THE CASE IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.\nTHAT WAS TODAY WHEN I LISTENED TO MONEY MANAGER BILL MILLER AT\nDELIVERING ALPHA. I STILL REGARD THAT AS A GREAT\nBENCHMARK, HE DID SOMETHING BECAUSE THE TEN-YEAR BOND\nYIELDED 9% AND SIX-MONTH TREASURY BILL WORTH 6%.\nTHESE DAYS, FIXED INCOME, ACCOUNT STOCKS, DIFFERENT\nPICTURE. UNCOMPETITIVE 1.73% AND\nSIX-MOBILE .53%. EVEN THOUGH THE SAIP 500 IS MORE\nEXPENSIVE NOW THAN A PRICED EARNINGS BASIS THEN, HE TOLD THE\nCROWD THAT STOCKS ARE, AND I QUOTE, STUPIDLY CHEAP WHILE\nBONDS ARE RIDICULOUSLY OVERPRICED.\nHE REMINDED US, AND I QUOTE AGAIN, OUTLOOK FOR THE U.S.\nECONOMY IS SOLID. AMONG THE BEST IN THE WORLD.\nLOW INFLATION AND LOW UNEMPLOYMENT.\nRECORD PRODUCTS, RECORD GDP, RECORD HOUSEHOLD NET WORTH,ANT\nQUOTE. HE WANTS TO SELL BONDS AND BUY\nSTOCKS FOR THOSE REASONS. TIM DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH TO UPSET\nTHE PICTURE. I WENT TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF\nCAUTION. I DON'T WANT TO RISK MAKING A\nBIG BET HERE ON STOCKS. RIGHT NOW I PREFER TO HAVE A\nHIGHER CASH POSITION AS I HAVE FOR MY CHARITABLE TRUST.\nYOU CAN FOLLOW ALONG ON IT. AND YESTERDAY I SUGGESTED\nRAISING CASH AGAIN WITH WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A GOOD GAME PLAN TO\nSELL INTO THAT STRENGTH. STILL, HERE IS THE BOTTOM LINE.\nI THINK BILL MILLER IS ON TO SOMETHING.\nWHEN THE COMPETITION OF STOCKS IS THAT TERRIBLE, WHEN THINGS\nARE DESCENT OUT THERE, MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T TAKE OUR CUE FROM THE\nLAST FED PLAYER AT BAT. LET ME SEE.\nYEAH. YEAH.\nYOU HAVE THIS CARD. THIS GUY'S CARD.\nTHERE ARE A HUNDRED THOUSAND FEWER BARRELS OF OIL USED\nEVERYDAY. JUST TAKE A TANKER AND STICK A\nHUNDRED THOUSAND BARRELS ON IT. INSTEAD, TAKE OUR CUE FROM THE\nVALUE THAT STOCKS ARE OFFERING AND BY THE WAY, AS THEY COME\nDOWN, THEY GET CHEAPER. NOT MORE EXPENSIVE.\nJANICE IN TEXAS, JANICE? >> HEY, JIM.\n>> HEY, JANICE. >> YAHOO! I BOUGHT ABOUT TWO\nYEARS AGO, BECAUSE I WANTED THE ASIAN EXPOSURE TO THE SEARCH\nINDUSTRY WITH ALI BA BA. >> YES.\n>> I WANT SOME VERIZON, SO SHOULD I STAY OR SHOULD GO?\n>> THAT'S INTERESTING. VERIZON HAS A GOOD YIELD,\nYIELDING 4.5. TREASURIRIES 1.7 FOR TENURE.\nI THINK THE COMPANY IS DOING WELL.\nTHEY ARE SELLING A LOT OF PHONES.\nI APPLAUD YOU FOR GETTING YAHOO!.\nTHIS HELPS RUN ALLEY BA BA, THAT'S ALL THAT YAHOO! REALLY IS\nNOW. YOU MAKE THAT SWITCH OUT OF\nYAHOO! INTO VERIZON AND I THINK YOU'LL BE VERY HAPPY.\n>>> ALL RIGHT, WANT TO TRADE A MINT FISHER?\nI'VE GOT A MINT FISHER HERE. FOR A YELLEN.\nGEEZ. THIS COULD BE A SWAP.\nTIME TO SELL YOUR COLLECTION OF FED TRADING CARDS AND LET'S PUT\nA LITTLE LESS EMPHASIS ON THESE GUYS OKAY?\nCOULD THIS GUY TAKE THE MARKET DOWN 400?\nI DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HE ADD CARD UNTIL TODAY.\nINSTEAD FOCUS ON THE VALUES CAN YOU FIND IN THIS INCREASINGLY\nVOLATILE MARKET. POTENTIAL RATE HIKE ON THE\nTABLE. ARE INVESTOR WORRIES WARRANTED?\nTHEN MY EXCLUSIVE WITH WELLS FARGO CEO.\nAFTER LAST WEEK'S REVELATION OF ONE OF THE LARGEST BANKS\nCREATING MILLIONS OF FAKE ACCOUNTS.\nMAYBE, MAYBE NOT. AND NOT ALL OF THE VOLATILITY OF\nTHIS MARKET COMES FROM THE FED. I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT THE STOCKS\nIN THE SITES OF BOTH TRUMP AND CLINTON.\nREMEMBER WHEN IT USED TO COME WITH A STICK OF GUM?\nNOW THAT HAD VALUE.

So when my asthma symptoms kept\n          coming back     on my long-term control\n           medicine.    I talked to my doctor and\n     found a missing piece   in my asthma treatment with\n             BREO. Once-daily BREO prevents asthma\n          symptoms.        BREO is for adults with asthma not well controlled  on a long-term asthma control\n           medicine, like an inhaled corticosteroid.   BREO won't replace a rescue\n            inhaler for sudden breathing problems.      BREO opens up airways to help improve breathing for a\n         full 24 hours. BREO contains a type of medicine that increases the risk of death       from asthma problems    and may increase the risk\n     of hospitalization in children and adolescents. BREO is not for people whose    asthma is well controlled\n             on a     long-term asthma control\n           medicine,         like an inhaled\n        corticosteroid.     Once your asthma is well\n          controlled,        your doctor will\n         decide if you          can stop BREO\n        and prescribe a     different asthma control\n           medicine,         like an inhaled\n        corticosteroid.    Do not take BREO more than\n          prescribed.       See your doctor if\n          your asthma        does not improve\n         or gets worse.   Ask your doctor if 24-hour\n              BREO    could be a missing piece\n            for you.  See if you're eligible for  12 months free at myBREO.com.",

HE WILL JOIN OUR SHOW LIVE FOR\nMORE IDEAS AND WILL BRING YOU HIGHLIGHTS OF INTERVIEWS WITH\nOTHERS. LIVE FROM DELIVERING ALPHA IN\nNEW YORK CITY. LET'S START WITH THE PRICE OF\nOIL REVERSING GAINS. JACKIE DEANGELES HAS DETAILS.\n>> GOOD AFTERNOON. 3% SELL OFF TODAY AND CLOSING AT\n$44.90. THREE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS\nIMPACTING OIL PRICES. THE FIRST WOULD BE THE MONTHLY\nREPORT TAKING DEMAND FORECASTS DOWN NOT JUST FOR THIS YEAR BUT\nNEXT YEAR, AS WELL. THE WALL STREET THESIS FOR THIS\nREBOUND THAT IS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN DEPENDS ON DEMAND STAYING\nAT LEAST FLAT OR TICKING UP. SO THAT'S NOT REALLY A GOOD\nSIGN. THE EQUITY PLUNGED TODAY AND\nALSO A LITTLE BIT OF STRENGTH IN THE DOLLAR NOT GOOD SIGNS FOR\nCRUDE OIL. INVENTORIES TOMORROW.\nREMEMBER LAST WEEK WE SAW A DRAW DOWN OF 14 MILLION BARRELS.\nSOME ARE LOOKING FOR A PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL BUILD.\nTHOSE ARE THE ONES WHO THINK LAST WEEK'S ACTION WAS A ONE OFF\nEVENT. THE BUILD FACTOR BEING PRICED\nINTO OIL PRICES TODAY. AS YOU CAN SEE THE EFFECT THAT\nIT HA. ONE REASON THAT WILL HOLD THE\nALGERIA MEETING. IT'S THE WILDCARD.\nBACK TO YOU. >> THANK YOU.\nKEEPING AN EYE ON THOSE CRUDE PRICES BELOW $45 A BARREL.\nTRACKING HIS BROADER SELL OFF AGAIN HERE.\n>> THIS IS ALL ABOUT WORRIES ABOUT THE FED POSSIBLY RAISING\nRATES. WE HAVE A RISK OFF DAY.\nWE HAVE A DOUBLE WHAMMY HITTING OIL STOCKS.\nWE HAVE GENERAL RISK OFF DAY. EXXON GETTING HIT.\nIT HAS BEEN A STALWART RECENTLY BUT BREAKING DOWN.\nIT IS AT THE LOWEST LEVEL SINCE APRIL.\n$85 YOU SEE RIGHT THERE. YOU WANT TO SEE A RISK OFF DAY?\nYOU HEARD THE TEN YEAR YIELD DROPPED OFF.\nNORMALLY THIS WOULD BE A BIG HELP TO BANK STOCKS.\nTHEY WOULD MOVE UP ON THAT. HOW MUCH IS THIS DEBATE WITH THE\nFED FREAKING OUT? IT HAS GONE 11 TO 18.\nLOOK AT THAT AT 18. HERE ARE THE SPEECHES FOR\nOCTOBER AND NOVEMBER. IT'S WHERE THE CASH IS RIGHT\nNOW. THAT'S A HUGE INCREASE IN THE\nVIX. WE HAVE FLATTENING IN THE VIX.\nWE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT IN A VERY LONG TIME.\nBACK TO YOU. >> BOB, THANK YOU.\nLET'S GET TO THE KEY POINT IN THE LAST COUPLE OF SESSIONS\nGOING BACK TO FRIDAY STOCKS AND BONDS BOTH SELLING OFF.\nI SAT DOWN WITH PAUL SINGER EARLIER TODAY AT DELIVERING\nALPHA AND SPOKE ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY FOR SELL OFF IN\nTANDEM TO CONTINUE. >> IT'S BEEN SO LONG IN THE\nMAKING THAT THE BOND PRICES ARE SO HIGH, INTEREST RATES ARE SO\nLOW THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO ASCERTAIN WHAT CHANGE IN\nTHINKING WILL GENERATE A GROUP THINK WITH A DIFFERENT VECTOR,\nTHINKING THAT BONDS ARE NOT THE SAFE HAVEN THAT BOTH STOCKS AND\nBONDS CAN GO DOWN. I THINK GO DOWN TOGETHER.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT AND WHAT HE SAID IN OUR \"CLOSING\nBELL\" EXCHANGE. MICHAEL FAR JOINS US FROM D.C.\nKEITH IS HERE AT POST NINE AND JACK BERUZIAN.\nTYPICALLY STOCKS GO DOWN AND THAT MEANS BONDS GO UP BECAUSE\nIT IS TAKING MONEY OUT OF ONE ASSET CLASS AND PUTTING IT IN\nANOTHER. >> PRETTY SIGNIFICANT ON THE\nSHORT TERM MOVE BASIS. ON THE LONGER TERM WE HAVE TO\nGET BACK TO A VERSION ON RELATIONSHIPS WE HAVE COME TO\nUNDERSTAND OVER THE LAST FIVE, TEN YEARS.\nTHEY HAVE DEFINITELY GOTTEN OUT OF WHACK.\nMR. SINGER IS RIGHT ON THAT. ON A SHORT TERM BASIS YOU ARE\nSEEING BOTH GO DOWN BECAUSE MARKETS ARE SO TEMPERAMENTAL.\nPART OF THAT IS WHAT MR. SINGER IS SAYING IS THAT ANY LITTLE\nMATCH OR FUSE WILL SET THEM OFF IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.\nYOU TAKE A LOOK AT OIL PRICES GOING DOWN, EQUITIES GOING DOWN,\nBONDS GOING DOWN. THAT IS A CLASSIC CONCERN STORY\nAND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE SEEING. THE MOVEMENTS HAVE BEEN SO\nDRAMATIC. ON FRIDAY WE HAD MARKETS.\nTHE VIX OVERBOUGHT. TODAY WE HAD THEM GETTING BACK\nTO NEUTRAL. TODAY THEY ARE VASTLY OVERSOLD.\nI THINK SHORT TERM THIS IS A VERY GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO START\nNIBBLING AROUND THE EDGES. >> WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THIS\nENVIRONMENT? >> HOLDING MY BREATH AND SEEING\nWHICH WAY THIS IS GOING TO SHAKE OUT.\nWE STARTED LAST WEEK AND THE MARKET DECLINED ON THE FED NEWS.\nI NEVER BELIEVED IT. I WROTE THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO\nHAVE A RATE HIKE BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR.\nI CONTINUE TO HOLD THAT POSITION.\nI THINK THAT THE UNCERTAINTY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEK IS\nPROBABLY MORE POLITICAL. I THINK THAT THE EXPECTATIONS\nFOR A CLINTON PRESIDENCY MIGHT HAVE BEEN UPSET SOME OVER THE\nWEEKEND AND I THINK THAT YOU ARE SEEING SOME TRADERS BEGIN TO\nVOTE WITH THEIR FEET. PARTICULARLY WITH MR. TRUMP'S\nCRITICISM OF FED CHAIRMAN YELLEN.\nWALL STREET HAS A LOT TO DIGEST COMING INTO THE BEGINNING OF\nTHIS WEEK. >> THERE WAS A BIT OF A DEBATE\nON FRIDAY ABOUT THE SELLOFF THAT DAY WHETHER IT WAS ABOUT THE FED\nOR ABOUT NORTH KOREA. NOW WE THINK MAYBE THE ELECTION.\nWE'RE AT 173 ON THE TEN YEAR. WHAT IS THAT ALL ABOUT?\n>> COMBINATION OF ALL OF THE ABOVE.\nONE OF THE SOUND BYTES IS WHEN SINGER SAID NOTHING IS WORKING\nWHEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT CENTRAL BANKS.\nI THINK THAT WAS SO INSIGHTFUL. RIGHT NOW THAT SEEMS TO BE ONE\nOF THESE OPINIONS THAT IS CREEPING INTO THE MENTALITY OF\nTHE INVESTING PUBLIC. OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST\nCOUPLE OF MONTHS WE HAVE GONE THROUGH THE LOW VOLATILE\nENVIRONMENT. WE SAW PEOPLE CHASING RETURNS,\nCHASING YIELD AND STARTED GETTING INTO STOCKS, TREATING\nTHEM LIKE BONDS. NOW THEY ARE GETTING THE\nVOLATILITY BACK AND WHEN MICHAEL FAR SAID IS RIGHT.\nTHEY START TO SMELL THE ELECTION AND ALL OF THOSE UNCERTAINTIES.\nBEFORE YOU KNOW IT WE HAVE A BIG MOVE IN THE MARKETS.\nI THINK FRIDAY WAS THE BEGINNING OF SOMETHING.\nFRIDAY MIGHT BE THE START OF WHAT IN HIND SIGHT WE WILL LOOK\nAT AS THE BEGINNING OF A MOVE DOWN.\nIT STARTED AROUND THIS LEVEL LAST YEAR.\nWE MADE A HIGH OF 2135. WE ARE RIGHT THERE AGAIN NOW.\nLET'S SEE IF I'M RIGHT Y. HAVE A FEELING.\nI HAVE A FEELING THESE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS CAN BE VERY\nDANGEROUS. >> PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TELLING US\nFOR SOME TIME IF INTEREST RATES MOVE HIGHER IT COULD HELP THE\nSTOCK MARKET. IF THE TEN YEAR MOVES UP TO 2%\nDO YOU EXPECT STOCKS WOULD FIND THEIR FOOTING OR IS THIS THE\nKIND OF ENVIRONMENT WE HAVE BEEN LAYING OUT WHERE UNFORTUNATELY\nTHEY WOULD BE SELLING OFF IN THAT ENVIRONMENT?\n>> ONLY IF MOVE TO 2% IS BASED ON ECONOMIC FUNDAMENTALS.\nONE THOUGHT I DIDN'T COMPLETE WAS ONE REASON THAT YOU ARE\nSEEING THE MARKET GO DOWN WHILE THE TEN YEAR YIELD IS GOING UP\nIS THAT IT IS A GLOBAL GROWTH CONCERN STORY BUT ALSO A CONCERN\nTHAT CENTRAL BANKS ARE TAPPED OUT AND JUST CAN'T DO MORE.\nTHAT IS WHAT JACK WAS ALLUDING TO.\nTHAT IS WHERE YOU ARE GETTING THE STORM HAPPENING TODAY.\nI WILL GO BACK AND SAY FOR THE LONGER TERM I THINK WE WILL SEE\nWEAKNESS IN THIS. SEPTEMBER IS ALWAYS A VOLATILE\nMONTH. ON THE SHORTER TERM I THINK\nTHERE ARE EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITIES TO STEP IN HERE.\nNEXT WEEK WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT RAISING RATES AND GOING TO\nGIVE US DOVISH LANGUAGE THEN YOU SEE THE MARKET RALLY AGAIN.\n>> WE HAVE A LOT TO GET TO. THANK YOU ALL.\nGOOD TO SEE YOU. >> FROM THE MACRO TO MICROSAYS\nHE IS SHORTING ALIBABA. TAKE A LISTEN.\n>> PEOPLE HAVE COMPARED AMAZON TO ALIBABA AND IT COULDN'T BE\nFURTHER FROM THE TRUTH. AMAZON IS A FREE CASH FLOW\nMACHINE BEGINNING IN 2002 AND HAS BEEN.\nTHIS IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF IT.\nIT IS JUST BURNING CASH IN A DRAMATIC RATE.\n>> ALIBABA IS LOWER TODAY. DAVID FAVOR JUST FINISHED A\nDELIVERING ALPHA DISCUSSION WITH ALIBABA EXECUTIVE VICE CHAIRMAN\nWHO HAS WORDS I CAN IMAGINE. >> WELL, IT'S AN INTERESTING\nOPPORTUNITY TO HEAR SORT OF BOTH SIDES.\nTHE EXECUTIVE VICE CHAIRMAN OF ALIBABA RIGHT THERE AT THE\nFOUNDING OF THE COMPANY BACK IN 1999 AND DISPUTES A LOT OF WHAT\nHE WOULD SAY AND POINTS OUT THAT DESPITE THAT DROP TODAY OF 1%\nTHE STOCK HAS BEEN A VERY STRONG PERFORMER OVER THE COURSE OF\nTHIS YEAR, HELPED IN PART BY THE NUMBERS A FEW WEEKS BACK WHERE\nIT DELIVERED TOP LINE GROWTH. SPECIFIC TO THE QUESTIONS AND\nCRITICISM THIS IS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY.\n>> THE PROBLEM IS HE DOESN'T SEEM TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE\nBUSINESS AND TRY TO APPRECIATE THE POWER OF THE DIGITAL ECONOMY\nIN CHINA. AND YOU CAN LAY A LOT OF CLAIMS\nAND ACCUSATIONS ON OUR BUSINESS. ON THE LOGISTICS BUSINESS WE\nMADE FULL DISCLOSURE ON THE PROFITS, LOSS, REVENUES, ASSETS,\nLIABILITIES OF THE BUSINESS. INVESTORS CAN DO THEIR OWN MATH.\nWHETHER YOU CONSOLIDATED OR NOT. >> SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT\nTHE 48 OR SO PERCENT OF THE DELIVERY BUSINESS THAT ALIBABA\nOWNS. IT DOESN'T CONTROL.\nMR. TSAI WENT ON EXPLAINING THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE CONTROL OF A\nCOMPANY THAT HAS AROUND 2 MILLION EMPLOYEES AS DOES THE\nDELIVERY OF WHAT IS 40 MILLION PACKAGES A DAY IN CHINA BY, OF\nCOURSE, WHAT IS THE LARGEST ONLINE COMMERCE PLATFORM IN THE\nWORLD. >> IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT JIM\nCHANOS. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SHORT\nALIBABA FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS ABOUT ACCOUNTING AND STRUCTURE\nAND HOW YOU CAN TRADE SHARES AND HAVE OWNERSHIP.\nI THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING THE WAY TSAI WAS SAYING\nFUNDAMENTALLY OUR TOP LINE JUST KEEPS GROWING.\n>> AND IT DOES. THERE IS NO REAL QUESTIONING\nTHAT ALTHOUGH THEY ARE ACTUALLY ELIMINATING ANY SORT OF REAL\nFOCUS ON MERCHANDISE VALUE. TO YOUR POINT THE TOP LINE LAST\nQUARTER ACCELERATED AND THAT IS THE OVERALL THEME THAT YOU GET\nFROM ALIBABA EXECUTIVES LIKE MR. TSAI IS WE ARE PLAYING TO THE\nGROWTH OF THE CHINESE CONSUMER AS THE ECONOMY CHANGES THAT WILL\nONLY CONTINUE AND WE HAVE THE WIND AT OUR BACKS.\nTHERE ARE NO SHORTAGES OF POTENTIAL CRITICS IN TERMS OF\nACTUAL NUMBERS AND SOME FREE CASH FLOW NUMBERS.\n>> THE BIGGEST IPO IN HISTORY. >> AND JUST IN THE LAST YEAR UP\n54%. MUCH TO THE CHAGRIN OF JIM\nCHANOS. >> WE HAVE 48 MINUTES.\nTHIS IS AN INTERESTING LAST HOUR OF TRADE.\nTHE DOW DOWN ALMOST 300",

ALL KINDS OF TRADE BARRIERS, AND\nI JUST WONDER FOR YOU WHO IS TRAVELING SO OFTEN AND SPEAKING\nTO LEADERS OF BOTH BUSINESS AND POLITICS AROUND THE GLOBE, WHAT\nIMPRESSION YOU GET FROM THEM, AND HOW WORRIED YOU ARE ABOUT\nTHAT TYPE? >> I WAS JUST OUT AT THE G20\nHONJO LAST WEEK AND WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT IS HOW TRADE\nIS SORT OF SOME MODERN LOW GROWTH RATE.\nAND HOW THIS POPULISM AND ANGER AND SORT OF CONCERNS ABOUT\nGLOBALIZATION ARE AFFECTING ALL KINDS OF COUNTRIES IN TERMS OF\nTHE POLITICAL WILL OF PEOPLE TO KEEP THE SYSTEM OPEN.\nAND THAT -- THAT WAS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE.\nIN EFFECT. BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I THINK WE'RE\nFACING A LOT OF ISSUES, ALL AT THE SAME TIME.\nI MEAN, YOU HAVE -- IF YOU HAVE GLOBALIZATION, WHICH HAS MADE\nSOME GROUPS, YOU KNOW -- POVERTY-REDUCED BY I THINK IT'S\n700 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. BUT YOU'VE ALSO GOT THIS TECH\nREVOLUTION, AND THE TECH REVOLUTION, DISRUPTION --\n>> THAT IS BLACKSTONE CEO STEVE SCHWARTZMAN AT DELIVERING ALPHA.\nJUST WANT SOME THOUGHTS TO WRAP-UP THE DAY OR TO LOOK\nAHEAD. >>IN HE EXPRESSES THE VIEW OF\nEVERYONE IN THAT POSITION. PEOPLE IN BUSINESS WHO DON'T\nFEEL AS IF THEY HAVE A PLACE IN THE CURRENT ELECTION CYCLE.\nAND THAT THEY'RE KIND OF MYSTIFIED BY NOT THAT MANY\nOPPORTUNITIES IN A LOW-GROWTH ECONOMY AND WHAT DO YOU DO?\nAND IT ALL SEEMS DEPENDENT ON INTEREST RATES, EVEN IF WE DON'T\nWANT IT TO BE. >> I THINK -- THESE ARE\nDISENFRANCHISED BILLIONAIRE REPUBLICANS.\nAND THAT'S -- ACROSS THE BOARD. EVEN THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.\nTHEY FEEL THEY'RE NOT BEING REPRESENTED BY DONALD TRUMP.\nTHEY CAN'T QUITE GET THEMSELVES TO ENDORSE HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHEY JUST FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE NO CHOICE.\n>> YEAH, DAVE SAYING IT PUTS YELLEN IN AN INTERESTING SPOT.\nEITHER YOU DO OR YOU DON'T, AND YOU SEEM DARNED AS THE SAYING\nGOES. EITHER WAY.\nGUYS, THANKS FOR JOINING ME ON \"CLOSING BELL.\"\nROB SOX, MICHAEL SANTOLI AND \"FAST MONEY\" BEGINS NOW.\n>> LIVE FROM THE NASDAQ OVERLOOKING NEW YORK CITY'S TIME\nSQUARE. PETE NAJARIAN, GUY ADAMI.\nTHERE'S MORE PAIN TO COME. HE'LL TELL US WHAT HE'S LOOKING\nAT AND CHECK OUT THESE TWO PHOTOS.\nCAN YOU TELL WHICH IS SHOT ON THE iPHONE 7?\nIF YOU CAN, IT MIGHT EXPLAIN WHY APPLE'S STOCK IS SURGING.\nAND LATER, HEADING OUT TO THE CONFERENCE OF CAPTIVATING WALL\nSTREET, THE MAN, THE MYTH, THE LEGEND, CARL ICAHN.\nWARNING ABOUT A MARKET SELLOFF. THE STORY OF THE DAY, THE DOW\nLOSING 258 POINTS AND REALLY STARTED WITH THE BOND MARKET.\nCHECK OUT THE YIELD. THIS IS WHY IT MATTERS TO\nSTOCKS. 7 OF THE 10 S&P SECTORS\nCURRENTLY YIELD MORE THAN THE TEN-YEAR BOND.\nINVESTORS BUYING STOCKS BECAUSE THEY ARE THE NEW BONDS.\nHOW BIG OF A PROBLEM IS THIS? BK.\n>> WELL, LISTEN, WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS.\nI MEAN, IT'S MADE ME SICK, WE TALKED ABOUT IT SO MUCH.\nTHIS IS WHAT IS GOING ON. PEOPLE ARE BUYING BONDS.\nWE'RE BUYING BONDS FOR CAPITAL APPRECIATION AND STOCKS FOR\nYIELD. IT'S AN UPSIDE DOWN MARKET.\nIT'S AN UPSIDE DOWN WORLD. NOW IT'S STARTING TO COME HOME\nTO ROOST. THE VOLATILITIES INCREASED.\nAND THE OTHER THING YOU NEED TO KNOW, THERE IS SOME UNDERLYING\nKRENTSZ. SOME STRATEGIES OUT THERE THAT\nBUY BOTH STOCKS AND BONDS. AND WHEN THE VOLATILITY IS LOW,\nTHEY GET BIGGER IN THEIR STOCK POSITIONS.\nWHEN THE VOLATILITY GOES HIGH, THEN THEY HAVE TO SELL THOSE\nSTOCK POSITIONS AND SELL THE BOND POSITIONS.\nSO THAT'S WHY YOU'RE STARTING TO SEE BOTH OF THESE COME DOWN.\nAND I WOULD SAY, IF YOU'RE A BULL, YOU WANT TO ROOT FOR LOWER\nRATES, BECAUSE HIGHER RATES ARE NOT GOOD FOR THIS STOCK MARKET.\n>> THOSE SO-CALLED RISK PAR ITY FUNDS.\nOUR FRIEND FROM JPMORGAN. WHAT WAS SO STUNNING ABOUT THE\nSELLOFF TODAY, ACROSS THE BOARD. DIDN'T MATTER WHAT ASSET\nCLASSES, BONDS, STOCKS, GOLD. >> RIGHT.\n>> AND THEN AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE DOLLAR REVERSED AS\nWELL. >> SOME OF THAT ENDS UP BEING\nPANIC AND WE HEAR ABOUT IT ALL OF THE TIME.\nWHEN PEOPLE ARE FEELING THE PAIN IN CERTAIN PLACES, THEY GO TO\nTHE PLACES WHERE THEY HAVE HAD WINNERS AND START TO TAKE SOME\nOF THAT OFF, AS WELL. SO I THINK THAT COMBINATION IS\nWHY WE SAW THIS JUST FOLLOW THROUGH AT THE VERY END OF THE\nDAY. WE ACTUALLY DROPPED ANOTHER 40\nPOINTS FROM WHERE WE WERE TRADING IN THE LAST MAYBE 15\nMINUTES OF THE DAY. WE HAVE BEEN TALKING FOR A\nREALLY LONG TIME ABOUT  SINCE THE MIDDLE OF JULY,\nSOMEWHERE BETWEEN 11 AND 13. NOW THESE BIG SPIKES IN\nVOLATILITY. THE OPPORTUNITY WAS, EITHER YOU\nWANT TO PROTECT OR YOU DO STOCK REPLACEMENT.\nWE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT TIME AND TIME AGAIN.\nONE OF THESE DAYS, PEOPLE WILL START LISTENING.\nBUT THEY OFTENTIMES DON'T, BECAUSE THEY GET VERY, VERY\nBULLHEADED IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY THINK IS REALLY GOING TO HAPPEN\nAND HOW LONG IT'S GOING TO EXTEND.\nSOONER OR LATER THAT ENDS. IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S ENDING RIGHT\nNOW AND VOLATILITY, BREAKING ABOVE THE 200-DAY MOVING AVERAGE\nFOR THE VIX, PRETTY IMPRESSIVE. PRETTY HEALTHY MOVE WHEN YOU\nLOOK AT A WEEK OR SO AGO, TRADING IN THE 12TH AND NOW\nWE'RE 18s AND IN THE 20s. INCREDIBLE HOW MUCH VOLATILITY\nCAN REALLY EXPLODE IN TIMES LIKE THIS WHEN PEOPLE SEE PANIC.\nTHAT DOESN'T MEAN THERE IS NOT OPPORTUNITIES OUT THERE.\nA FEW THINGS I WAS ABLE TO BUY TODAY.\nI ACTUALLY ADDED TO APPLE. I ALSO BOUGHT INTO LULULEMON.\nAND I ALSO LOOKED AT A FEW OTHER NAMES I THOUGHT WERE VERY, VERY\nINTERESTING. JETBLUE BEING ONE OF THEM IN THE\nAIRLINE INDUSTRY. >> HERE'S THE THING.\nPETE JUST LAID OUT THE VOLATILITY PICTURE.\nSIX OR SEVEN WEEKS, IT WAS BORING.\nHAD TO MAKE STORIES UP HERE AND THERE.\nBUT HERE ALL OF A SUDDEN NOW WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE RATES ARE\nMOVING, STOCKS ARE MOVING, IT'S ALL HAPPENING VERY SHORT PERIOD\nOF TIME. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO\nREMEMBER, THE LAST TIME THE FED RAISED INTEREST RATES, LAST\nDECEMBER, THE FIRST TIME IN NINE YEARS, THE YIELD IN THE TEN-YEAR\nTREASURY 2.2%. HERE WE ARE AT 1.73 AND PEOPLE\nARE PANICKING IN THE STOCK MARKET A LITTLE BIT AS WE'RE UP\nFROM 1.31 A COUPLE MONTHS AGO HERE.\nAND I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE REASON TO PANIC.\nBECAUSE WE HAVE INTEREST RATES MOVING HIGHER, WE KNOW THAT THE\nFED IS NOT GOING TO BE RAISING RATES UNTIL DECEMBER.\nIN SOME WAYS -- >> I DON'T KNOW IF WE KNOW THAT.\n>> WE KIND OF DO. THEY MADE A FAIRLY CLEAR OVER\nTHE LAST COUPLE DAYS THAT THEY MAY GO IN SEPTEMBER.\n>> NOT A CHANCE. >> I'M NOT SURE IT'S AS CLEAR.\nI DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD. BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT\nCLEAR. >> WHEN THE FED LOWERS RATES,\nTHEY WANT TO SURPRISE THE MARKET AND THEY WANT TO HAVE THAT\nEFFECT ON THE STOCK MARKET OR ON RISK ASSETS IN GENERAL.\nTHEY DON'T WANT TO DO IT THE OTHER WAY, RIGHT?\n>> THEY DON'T -- IF THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT RAISING RATES,\nTHEY DON'T WANT TO SHOCK YOU ON IT.\nTHAT'S WHY THEY HAVE COME OUT OVER THE LAST WEEK AND SAID\nTHAT. >> THE FUTURES ARE PRICEY --\n>> THEY'RE TRYING TO MANIPULATE THAT MARKET.\nTHEY'RE TRYING TO GET THAT MARKET --\n>> WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT? >> THEY DON'T WANT TO RAISE\nRATES. >> GOING BACK TO 1994, GOLDMAN\nSACHS RESEARCH FROM MAY. WHEN THEY LOOKED AT THE 31 RATE\nINCREASES, OKAY? DURING THAT TIME PERIOD, 50%,\nOKAY -- 50% PROBABILITY OF A RATE HIKE 30 DAYS PRYER.\nTHEY DON'T LIKE TO SURPRISE. >> THAT'S MY POINT.\n>> THIS IS WHAT WE'VE GOT. WE GOT THAT ON FRIDAY, THE\nREACTION TODAY. YOU KNOW WHAT'S STRIKING ABOUT\nFRIDAY AND TODAY? >> TELL ME, PLEASE.\n>> THE S&P 500 CLOSED -- WE'RE A FEW POINTS AWAY FROM WHERE WE\nACTUALLY CLOSED ON FRIDAY. THAT'S WHAT THE DAMAGE HAS BEEN.\nROUND TRIP. >> TOTAL ROUND TRIP.\nTO ME THE DAMAGE STARTED WITH SOVEREIGN BONDS.\n>> YES, DEFINITELY. >> IT'S INTERESTING.\nWE HAD KEVIN O'LEARY ON I FORGET WHAT NIGHT LAST WEEK, TALKED\nABOUT WHY HE WANTED TO BE IN EUROPEAN STOCKS BECAUSE THE ECB\nHAD HIS BACK. THE NEXT DAY, THE ECB BASICALLY\nCAME OUT AND SAID, GUESS WHAT, KEVIN O'LEARY, WE NO LONGER HAVE\nYOUR BACK. AND IF YOU LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENED\nTO INTEREST RATES SINCE THEN, THEY HAVE ALL GONE UP IN A\nSIGNIFICANT FASHION. SO I THINK U.S. RATES ARE MORE\nFUNCTION OF WHAT'S HAPPENING OVERSEAS.\nDOESN'T MATTER. GETS YOU TO THE SAME PLACE.\n>> INCLUDING THE GERMAN IT TEN-YEAR BOND.\nWE SAW THAT RISE FROM NEGATIVE. >> NEGATIVE YIELDING BONDS ARE A\nBUBBLE. ALMOST BY DEFINITION.\nIT'S -- IT'S NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.\nAND IT'S -- IT'S HAPPENING NOW. YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE LONG.\nTHOSE TYPE OF FIXED INCOME. I COULD MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT\nON A SELLOFF YOU WANT TO START BUYING TLT ON A RELATIVE VALUE\nBASIS. >> BUYING --\n>> THAT'S WHAT I WOULD DO. I HAVE ABOUT A THIRD OF A\nPOSITION IN TLT RIGHT NOW. AND IF WE GET, LET'S SAY BACK TO\nMAYBE -- IF WE GET TO 180-ISH ON THE TEN-YEAR, I'LL PROBABLY ADD\nA LITTLE MORE TLT, BECAUSE WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THE\nFUNDAMENTALS OF THE ECONOMY ARE DETERIORATING, EVEN IF THE FED\nRAISES. THEN PEOPLE ARE STILL GOING TO\nWANT TO BUY TLT, BECAUSE THE DOLLAR IS GOING TO GO UP.\nWHICH HAS BEEN HAPPENING FOR THE LAST YEAR OR SO.\nSO ON THESE PULL BACKS, THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.\n>> SO THE CROSS CURRENT COMING OUT OF DELIVERING ALPHA TODAY,\nSAYING SELL G 7 BONDS. >> I WOULD RATHER SELL GERMAN\nBONDS AND ITALIAN BONDS. >> I THINK THEY'RE STILL A SAFE\nHAVEN. >> WHAT DO YOU THINK?\n>> I THINK YOU CAN BUY U.S. TREASURIES, DO THE TLT CLOSER TO\n130. I DON'T THINK THAT THEY'RE GOING\nTO GO IN SEPTEMBER OR NOVEMBER. AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT --\nTHEY'VE ALREADY PRICED IN A 25 BASIS POINT MOVE SINCE THE FED\nSTARTED TALKING A LITTLE BIT MORE --\n>> SHORT-TERM BUY ON THE MARKET OVERALL?\nYOU THINK THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GO IN SEPTEMBER --\n>> 2050 IN THE S&P. HIGHER THAN IN MID DECEMBER WHEN\nTHEY DID THE RAISE. AND WE ARE AT 3% FROM THE HIGHS.\nI THINK IF YOU GET THAT SORT OF FIBER CENT PULL BACK --\n>> YOU KNOW WHAT STOOD OUT TODAY?\n>> WHAT STOOD OUT TODAY, MELISSA?\n>> TECHNOLOGY. >> YOU HEARD PETEY OVER THERE\nTALKING ABOUT -- APPLE HAD A HUGE PART OF THAT, NO QUESTION\nABOUT IT. WHAT I THOUGHT ALSO IS\nINTERESTING TODAY. NOT TO -- YOUR QUESTION WAS\nFINANCIALS UNDERPERFORMED, RIGHT?\nYOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT ON A DAY LIKE TODAY, FINANCIALS WOULD BE\nDOWN, BUT NOT DOWN NEARLY AS MUCH.\nI DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS BUT DEFINITELY TOOK OUT.\n>> THE YIELD CURVE STEEPENED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF JULY.\n>> WELLS FARGO. AND THEN I WOULD ADD IN OIL,\nTOO. RIGHT?\nWE KNOW THAT AT SOME POINT OIL STOCKS ARE BECOMING -- NOT A 45,\nPROBABLY BELOW 40. YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME PEOPLE\nTAKING PROFITS IN ANTICIPATION OF THAT.\n>> ALL RIGHT. IT HAS BEEN A BUMPY RIGHT FOR\nINVESTORS IN SEPTEMBER, TO SAY THE LEAST.\nIF YOU WOULD HAVE LISTENED OH OUR NEXT GUEST, YOU WOULD HAVE\nMADE SOME MONEY. THERE IS CLEARLY A CASE WE COULD\nGET AN UPSIDE BREAK OUT HERE, BUT WITH THE LONG STOCK GOING\nINTO THE WORST MONTH SEASONALLY SPEAKING, I THINK THE BIGGER\nTRADE IS TO THE DOWN SIDE. THE NECK LINE HERE, 2130, THAT'S\nTHE POINT YOU DO NOT WANT TO GO BENEATH.\n>> 2130. WE'RE AT 2127 ON THE CLOSE HERE.\nSO IS THE CORRECTION COMING? RICH ROSS OF ISI IS BACK.\nWHAT DO YOU SAY, RICH? >> YEAH, MELISSA.\nTHANKS FOR THAT. YOU'RE TOO KIND.\nOBVIOUSLY THE PROBLEM FOR STOCKS IS BONDS.\nIT'S NOT THE ONLY PROBLEM, BUT LET'S FOCUS ON THAT TODAY.\nTHIS IS YOUR TEN-YEAR YIELD. WE SEE YOU'RE STILL IN A DOWN\nTREND, THIS IS A BIG MOVE IN TERMS OF YIELD FROM 135 ALL THE\nWAY BACK UP TO 175, 176. I HEARD BK REFERENCE THIS.\nYOUR 200-DAY. 180.\nABOVE 180, FORGET ABOUT IT. HERE'S THE CHART THAT MAKES IT\nREAL INTERESTING. THE WEEKLY, THE BIG DOUBLE\nBOTTOM HERE, A FALSE BREAKDOWN TO AN ALL-TIME LOW IN YIELD IS\nTHE MIRROR IMAGE OF THE FALSE BREAKOUT TO AN ALL-TIME HIGH IN\nSTOCKS. JULY OF 2012, THE LAST BOTTOM,\nJULY OF 2016. JULY, BAD TIME FOR A BOTTOM IN\nYIELDS AND A -- >> SORRY TO INTERRUPT.\nWE'RE AWAITING SOME NEWS OUT OF DELIVERING ALPHA.\nBOTTOM LINE, THOUGH, CORRECTION? WHAT DO YOU SEE FOR STOCKS?\n>> BOTTOM LINE, YES. 2050, 2,000 IS WHERE I BECOME\nEXTREMELY INTERESTED. 2050, YOU PROBABLY GET A BOUNCE.\n>> THANKS, RICH ISI. WE WANT TO LISTEN IN ON CARL\nICAHN BEING INTERVIEWED BY SCOTT WAPNER.\n>> INTERESTING DAY. DOW DOWN 260 POINTS.\nAND WE'VE HEARD FROM SOME OF THE WORLD'S BEST INVESTORS AND\nBRIGHTEST INVESTORS TODAY WHO SAY THAT TIMES ARE DANGEROUS.\nPAUL SINGER, WHO YOU LISTENED TO BACK IN YOUR OFFICE, SAID THAT\nIT WAS A DANGEROUS TIME. RAY DAHL OWARNED IF THE FED\nRAISES INTEREST RATES, YOU COULD HAVE ASYMMETRIC RISKS.\nARE YOU STILL AS NEGATIVE TODAY AS YOU HAVE BEEN FOR THE BETTER\nPART OF THE LAST YEAR? >> YEAH.\nI MEAN, I DON'T KNOW IF NEGATIVE IS THE RIGHT WORD, EXACTLY.\nBUT I THINK THERE ARE TREMENDOUS RISKS.\nAND -- BUT I THINK ANYONE THAT IS GOING TO TELL YOU IT'S GOING\nTO GO DOWN TOMORROW, NEXT WEEK, EVEN NEXT MONTH OR NEXT YEAR,\nIT'S SORT OF GUESSING GAME. BUT YOU COULD LOOK AT THE\nENVIRONMENT AND I THINK IT'S VERY DANGEROUS.\nIN OTHER WORDS, YOU ARE WALKING ON A LEDGE, AND YOU MIGHT MAKE\nIT TO THE END. BUT, HEY, YOU FALL OFF THAT\nLEDGE, YOU'RE GOING TO REALLY SEE TROUBLE.\nAND I THINK THAT COULD WELL BE. >> WHAT PUSHES YOU OFF THE\nLEDGE? IS IT THE FED RAISING INTEREST\nRATES? YOU THINK THEY SHOULD?\nJAMIE DIMON YESTERDAY SAID THEY SHOULD.\nTODAY RAY DAHL OSAID THEY SHOULDN'T.\nWHAT DOES CARL ICAHN SAY? >> I REALLY WILL TELL YOU I\nDON'T THINK IT MATTERS. BECAUSE EITHER WAY, THERE'S A\nPROBLEM. IF YOU DON'T RAISE INTEREST\nRATES, I THINK WE'RE IN A MAJOR BUBBLE.\nYOU CAN'T -- I THINK CIGNA SAID IT RIGHT.\nI HEARD HIM FOR A WHILE. AND HE IS A VERY SMART GUY.\nI'VE KNOWN HIM FOR YEARS. I THINK HE'S SMART, DESPITE THE\nFACT THAT HE'S NOT FOR TRUMP. I THINK HE'S SMART.\nSO, YEAH. HE TOLD ME THAT.\nYOU KNOW. NO UNCERTAIN TERMS.\nI JUST SAW HIM -- I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM FOR A FEW MONTHS.\nHE TAKES IT REALLY SERIOUSLY. AND HE SAYS ME SOMEWHERE, AND HE\nLOOKS AT ME, \"CARL -- SORT OF COMPLIMENTARY.\nHE SAID, YOU'RE A SMART GUY, YOU'RE A SUPER SMART GUY.\nAND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE'S GOT THIS RAGE.\nHOW CAN YOU BE FOR TRUMP! AND FIRST I WAS LAUGHING.\nAND THEN I SAID, RELAX, RELAX, PAUL.\nAND HE REALLY -- BUT HE'S A VERY -- HE IS A VERY SMART GUY.\nAND HE'S ONE OF THE FEW GUYS I REALLY RESPECT ON WALL STREET.\nAND I THOUGHT -- I LISTENED TO HIM TODAY, AND I HONESTLY -- A\nLOT OF THE THINGS HE SAID I COULDN'T HAVE SAID IT BETTER\nMYSELF. AND THAT'S SAYING A LOT.\nHE -- HE WAS RIGHT ON. YOU KNOW WHAT HE WAS REALLY ON\nAND -- WE GET INTO THESE REGULATORY AGENCIES.\nAND THERE ARE GOOD REGULATORY AGENCIES THAT DO GOOD JOBS, GOOD\nREGULATORS. BUT THERE ARE SO MANY THAT --\nHIS WORDS WERE RIGHT ON. AMAZINGLY ARREST FWANT WHEN YOU\nTALK TO THEM. AND --\n>> YOU'VE TAKEN ON THE EPA. >> IT'S NOT EVEN TAKING ON.\nA WOMAN IN THE EPA, LOOK, I'M TOO OLD NOT TO BE POLITICALLY\nCORRECT. THIS WOMAN, JANET McCABE.\nAND YOU KNOW, SHE'S NUMBER TWO SOMETHING OR OTHER.\nAND SHE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MOST IDIOTIC -- AND, LOOK, I\nHAVE AN AGENDA HERE. BUT THE REASON I'M BRINGING IT\nUP IS IT FITS INTO WHAT IT IS WRONG WITH OUR ECONOMY.\nPEOPLE LIKE HER. AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY.\nNO, SERIOUSLY. AND EVERYBODY IS AFRAID TO SAY\nANYTHING ABOUT. OH, DON'T SAY ANYTHING, THERE\nWILL BE REPRISAL. I'M TOO OLD FOR THAT.\nLET THEM DO REPRISAL. WE OWN A REFINERY.\nREFINERIES, A COUPLE OF THEM. AND HERE'S WHAT THEY DO.\nAND HERE'S HOW IRRATIONAL IT IS. AND SHE'S RUNNING THIS PROGRAM.\nAND GET THIS. IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE.\nIT'S LIKE OUT OF \"ALICE IN WONDERLAND.\"\nTHEY HAVE THIS PROGRAM WHERE -- I'M NOT AGAINST THE RFS, AND I'M\nNOT -- I'M CERTAINLY NOT AGAINST ETHANOL OR FOR ETHANOL OR CLEAN\nAIR. I LIKE CLEAN AIR, I THINK IT'S\nGREAT. BUT THE WHOLE POINT OF WHAT I'M\nSAYING IS, THAT A FEW YEARS AGO, THEY PASSED THE CLEAN AIR ACT,\nAND RENEWABLE FUEL STANDARDS. AND THAT'S FINE.\nAND THEN THEY COME TO THE -- THEY COME TO THIS POINT, THEY GO\nTO THE EPA AND SAY, IN ALL YOUR WISDOM.\nAND I WILL SAY THIS. I MEAN, JANET McCABE, I'M\nCERTAIN SHE IS A SMART WOMAN AND NICE WOMAN.\nNEVER RUN A BUSINESS, NO BUSINESS BACKGROUND.\nAND THEY SAY, YOU OR WHOEVER DID THIS, YOU ARE GOING TO POLICE\nTHE FACT THAT IN THE CLEAN AIR ACT -- I'M GOING TO MAKE IT\nSIMPLE, BECAUSE I KNOW SCOTT IS GOING TO PUSH ME OFF IN A\nMINUTE, BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS MUCH.\nBUT,",

THERE IS FEAR THAT YOU COULD SEE\nMAYBE A FOUR OR FIVE MILLION BARREL JUMP IN INVENTORIES AFTER\nTHE CLOSE. >> BECAUSE LAST WEEK'S DRAW WAS\nEXAGGERATED. >> BY THAT STORM.\nAFTER THE STORM LEFT, THE TANKERS DID UNLOAD AND REPLACED.\n>> WHAT'S THE PSYCHOLOGICAL LEVEL THAT IS IMPORTANT FOR OIL\nTO HOLD HERE? >> I THINK PROBABLY AROUND 43,\nAND WE MAY SEE A PUSH TOWARDS THAT IF I'M RIGHT ABOUT THE BIG\nINVENTORIES AFTER THE CLOSE. >> BIG JUMP IN THE VIX UP ABOVE\n18. ANY CAUSE FOR CONCERN THERE?\n>> I THINK PEOPLE ARE SENSING AFTER HAVING NO VOLATILITY FOR\nNEARLY TWO MONTHS VOLATILITY HAS COME BACK IN.\nI THINK THEY'RE AFRAID THAT YOU CAN WIND UP WITH A SURPRISE\nHERE. MAYBE FROM THE CENTRAL BANKS.\nYOU'RE GOING TO GET JAPAN NEXT WEEK AND WE'LL SEE WHERE WE\nSTART MOVING ON THIS. IT DOES LOOK TO ME LIKE THEY'RE\nNOT OUT OF BULLETS, THEN THEY'RE CERTAINLY STRAINING, AND IT'S\nGOING TO BE A BIT OF A PROBLEM. I WOULD KEEP MY EYE ON THE YIELD\nAND SEE IF THAT'S GOING TO CAUSE FURTHER PRESSURE.\n>> FINALLY, WHEN DALIA REITERATES HIS LONG-TERM OPINION\nON THE DEBT CYCLE, ARE YOU CONVINCED?\n>> HE IS AN ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT MAN, BUT I'M NOT AS CONVINCED\nTHAT IT'S -- WHAT DID HE CALL IT -- A BEAUTIFUL DELEVERAGING.\nDOESN'T LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL TO ME. MAYBE BEAUTY IS IN THE EYE OF\nTHE BEHOLDER, BUT THIS LOOKS LIKE A STRUGGLE.\n>> ART, THANKS. ART CASHIN HERE.\nA LOT MORE FROM DELIVERING ALPHA, AND BACK IN JUST A\nMOMENT. DON'T GO AWAY.",

THIS IS ONE APPLICATION OF IT IN\nMACRO MARKETS. THERE ARE OTHER TYPES OF\nINVESTING WE CALL RISK FACTOR INVESTS.\nIT'S THIS IDEA THAT YOU TRY TO BUY SECURITY, BUY AND SELL\nSECURITIES WHICH ARE EXPOSED TO SOME SORT OF A RISK.\nUNCERTAINTY, LIQUIDITY, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.\nAND OVER TIME YOU BUILD -- YOU GET A RETURN, A RISK PREMIUM.\nNO DIFFERENT THAN INSURANCE COMPANY GETS PAID FOR INSURING\nYOU AGAINST LOSS OF YOUR HOUSE. >> WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF THAT\nRIGHT NOW? >> ONE FACTOR WE PARTICULARLY\nLIKE TODAY IS EMERGING CURRENCY CARE.\nWHAT THAT MEANS IS LONG POSITIONS IN THE HIGHEST\nYIELDING CURRENCIES WITHIN EMERGING MARKETS LIKE THE\nTURKISH LIRA, THE INDIAN RAPEA. >> THE FED MAY BE ON THE BRINK\nOF RAISING INTEREST RATES AGAIN. WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME\nTO EMERGING MARKETS. THEY GOT CRUSHED.\n>> THAT'S CORRECT. THAT'S WHY YOU WANT TO BUILD A\nFACTOR PORTFOLIO WHICH TRIES TO HEDGE OUT THAT KIND OF RISK.\nTHAT'S WHY WHAT I'M PROPOSING IS LONG ON SOME EMERGING MARKETS,\nLONG ON OTHER EMERGING MARKETS. WHEN THERE'S A SELL-OFF JOINTLY,\nIT'S NOT HIT BY THAT SAME SORT OF RISK FACTOR.\nIT'S A DIFFERENT DIMENSION. I'M TRYING TO CAPTURE THE\nRELATIVE VALUE IN INTEREST RATES ACROSS EMERGING MARKETS.\n>> I WANT TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING.\nI WAS NOT ON THE PANEL. YOU'RE A QUANTITATIVE DRIVEN\nFUND.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AT SOME\nPOINT, CONCEIVABLY PUTTING YOU OUT OF BUSINESS.\n>> SOMEBODY HAS TO PROGRAM THE ROBOT.\n>> RIGHT. >> I THINK QUANTITATIVE\nINVESTING AT ITS CORE IS SIMPLE. IT'S TAKING THE SAME SORT OF\nINFORMATION HUMANS USE TO MAKE DECISIONS BUT REMOVING SORT OF\nBEHAVIORAL BIASES AND EMOTION FROM THE DECISION.\nAND USING THE POWER OF COMPUTERS AND DATA TO FIND RELATIONSHIPS\nTHAT AREN'T MAYBE PARENT TO THE NAKED EYE AND FINALLY, TO BE\nABLE TO REACT TO THAT REAL TIME ACROSS AN INFINITE NUMBER OF\nMARKETS. THERE'S NO REASON WHY YOU CAN'T\nUSE A QUANTITATIVE MODEL 24 HOURS A DAY ACROSS ANY PIECE OF\nINFORMATION THAT'S AVAILABLE. THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT.\nIT'S NOT THAT IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY BETTER.\nIT'S A DIFFERENT APPROACH. >> IT'S BEEN VERY POPULAR\nPOST-FINANCIAL CRISIS. IT'S ATTRACTED A LOT OF MONEY.\nHAS THAT PEAKED AT ALL? WHAT ARE YOU SEEING IN THE FLOW?\n>> FLOW FALLS PERFORMANCE. BECAUSE A LOT OF QUANTITATIVE\nSTRATEGIES HAVE DONE WELL, A LOT OF INFLOWS, THE AREAS WHERE\nWE'VE SEEN THE BEST PERFORMANCE HAVE BEEN QUANTITATIVE EQUITY\nRISK FACTORS. SOMETIMES PEOPLE REFER TO IT AS\nSMART DATA. IT'S TILTS WITHIN STOCKS TOWARDS\nVALUE STOCKS, MOMENTUM STOCKS, QUALITY STOCKS, PROFITABLE\nSTOCKS. AND THE RESULT OF THAT HAS BEEN\nFIRST A TAIL WIND, WHICH HAS HELPED PERFORMANCE THROUGH THE\nBEGINNING OF THIS YEAR, THE PRIOR TWO YEARS, THE REALIZED\nRETURNS HAD BEEN WELL ABOVE LONG-TERM AVERAGES.\nAND THIS YEAR, BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH MONEY COMING IN AND\nHAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY COMING OUT AROUND JANUARY,\nTHERE'S SOME SELL-OFFS DELEVERAGING A BIG HEDGE FUND,\nTHEY'VE SEEN ACTUALLY PRETTY SUBSTANTIALLY POOR PERFORMANCE\nBECAUSE SO MUCH MONEY HAS COME IN.\nWE DON'T SEE THAT MUCH CROWDING IN OTHER MARKETS.\nPARTICULARLY IN QUANTITATIVE EQUITY MARKETS THERE'S A LOT OF\nCROWDING. >> THE DOW IS DOWN ALMOST 200\nPOINTS. DO YOU SEE THIS MOVE HAVING\nMOMENTUM TO THE DOWN SIDE? >> OUR MODELS, WE HAVE VERY\nSHORT-TERM MODELS THAT LOOK AT SHORT-TERM MOVES.\nIN GENERAL WHEN YOU SEE A SHARP CORRECTION, A SHARP MOVE LIKE\nTHIS, THEY TEND TO REBOUND. IT OFTEN CAN TAKE TWO OR THREE\nDAYS, THOUGH. A ONE-DAY MOVE MAY NOT BE\nENOUGH.

INVESTOR MONEY RETURNS AND MOST\nHEDGE FUND STRATEGIES ARE RELATIVE VALUE.\nYOU GET AN EXCESS RETURN, FLOOD OF MONEY AND THE RETURN GOES\nAWAY AND THE MONEY LEAVES AND THEN THE RETURNS COME BACK.\n>> PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PREDICTING THE DEMISE OF THE HEDGE FUND\nINDUSTRY FOR SOME TIME. THAT HASN'T HAPPENED.\nASSETS HAVE ACTUALLY MOVED IN. THIS YEAR, CERTAINLY ANOTHER ONE\nWHERE ACTIVELY MANAGED HEDGE FUNDS, CERTAINLY THE LONG/SHORT\nVARIETY ARE UNDERPERFORMING THEIR BENCHMARKS AND WELL SO.\nIS THERE EVER GOING TO BE SOME SORT OF A TIPPING POINT WHERE\nFEES COME UNDER SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE AND ASSETS REALLY DO\nSTART TO MOVE OUT OF THIS AREA AS SOME OF THE INSTITUTIONS AND\nOTHERS WHO INVEST IN HEDGE FUNDS SAY WHAT ARE WE DOING?\n>> I DO THINK HEDGE FUND FEES WILL COME DOWN.\nINVESTORS ARE GETTING A LOT SMARTER ABOUT DECOMPOSING ALPHA\nAND BETA. IN OTHER WORDS, THE MAJORITY OF\nHEDGE FUNDS ARE TYPICAL EQUITY LONG HEDGE FUNDS WHERE THE\nUNDERPERFORMANCE HAS BEEN THE MOST PRONOUNCED.\nWHAT INVESTORS ARE STARTING TO DO, THEY CAN BUY BETA FOR A\nCOUPLE OF BASIS POINTS. THEY WANT TO PAY FOR THE EXCESS\nRETURN. SO I THINK THAT KIND OF\nDELINEATION WILL PUT FEE PRESSURE ON THE INDUSTRY.\nBUT I'M REALLY IN THE CAMP THAT THE HEDGE FUND INDUSTRY TWO\nYEARS FROM NOW WILL BE LARGER, NOT SMALLER.\n>> WHY? >> BECAUSE IT'S REALLY\nIMPORTANT. IF DONE RIGHT, IT'S A REALLY\nIMPORTANT DIVERSIFIER IN THE CONTEXT OF AN OVERALL PORTFOLIO.\nAGAIN, THE OTHER THING YOU'LL START TO SEE IS DIVERGENCE OF\nRETURNS ACROSS TRADITIONAL ASSET CLASSES.\nHAVING SOMEONE WHO CAN ACTIVELY ALLOCATE AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF\nOPPORTUNITIES, I THINK, IS GOING TO ADD VALUE AND BE REALLY\nIMPORTANT ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE RETURN TARGETS OF, YOU\nKNOW, 7% TO 8%. >> DOES IT SAY SOMETHING ABOUT\nYOUR VIEW ON THE OVERALL MACRO AND MARKET ENVIRONMENT, THAT YOU\nEXPECT HEDGE FUNDS TO GROW THE NEXT FEW YEARS IN TERMS OF WHAT\nYOUR EXPECTATIONS ARE FOR RETURNS AND VARIOUS ASSET\nCLASSES? >> YEAH.\nI THINK RETURNS ARE GOING TO BE CHALLENGED ACROSS ASSET CLASSES\nAND OVERALL RETURN EXPECTATIONS, ABSOLUTELY, ARE GOING TO COME\nDOWN. YOU KNOW, AGAIN, THAT SAID I DO\nTHINK THERE ARE GOING TO BE POCKETS OF GREAT OPPORTUNITIES\nIN THE HEDGE FUND SPACE RIGHT NOW.\nONE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES I THINK IS REALLY ATTRACTIVE IS MERGR\nARBITRAGE. >> NO KIDDING.\nWHY IS THAT? >> CLASSIC SUPPLY AND DEMAND\nBALANCE. ACTIVITY DOWN A LITTLE BIT FROM\nLAST YEAR BUT THE NUMBER OF DEALS OVER $10 MILLION IS\nACTUALLY UP 50% FROM THE LAST CYCLE AND LARGEST TRADITIONAL\nPLAYERS AND MERGER SPREADS WERE THE INVESTMENT BANKPRIEARY\nTRADING DESKS. YOU HAVE MICROSOFT, LINKED IN,\nAND THAT'S BEEN OVER 10% ANNUALIZED.\n$26 BILLION DEAL. IF THAT WAS A $2 BILLION DEAL,\nTHE SPREAD WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER.\nSO, PLACES LIKE THAT ARE REALLY INTERESTING.\n>> ONE OF MY MERNLER FRIENDS ARE HAPPY TO HEAR THAT, HOPING THAT\nWILL BE THE CASE. IT'S NOT BEEN WITHOUT ITS\nPITFALLS. IN TERMS OF THE RISK, AS YOU\nWELL KNOW, DAWN, THE NUMBER OF DEALS THAT WAS NOT EXPECTED YOU\nHAVE TO PICK THE RIGHT MANAGER. DON'T YOU?\n>> IT'S A SHORT TAIL STRATEGY. YOU CAN STEP ON A LAND MINE.\nTHE KEY IS HAVING A SMART MANAGER AND HAVING A DIVERSIFIED\nPORTFOLIO. >> BEYOND DEALS, DAWN WHAT IS\nYOUR OUTLOOK ON THE CURRENT POLITICAL RISK THAT MANY PEOPLE\nHERE AGREE IS ELEVATED, ESPECIALLY HERE IN THE UNITED\nSTATES, HEADING INTO THE ELECTION?\nTHIS MARKET, WHICH IS BEING SORT OF JERKED AROUND BY VARIOUS FED\nSPEAKERS INTO A VERY IMPORTANT MEETING NEXT WEEK.\n>> IT'S BEEN REALLY INTERESTING TO ME.\nIT FEELS LIKE THE MARKETS ARE VERY CENTRAL BANK FIXATED AND\nNOT PAYING ENOUGH ATTENTION TO THE POLITICAL ANGLE THAT YOU'RE\nTALKING ABOUT WITH THE U.S. ELECTIONS, WITH REFERENDUM IN\nITALY. AND I THINK THAT'S GOING TO\nDRIVE MORE OF THE MARKET VOLATILITY GOING FORWARD.\nAND I THINK WHAT WE'VE SEEN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS IN MARKETS,\nTHERE'S A LOT OF DEBATE GOING ON IN TERMS OF THE DIMINISHING\nRETURNS FROM CENTRAL BANK POLICY AND ALSO KIND OF THE FORTITUDE\nOF THE BANKS TO STAY THE COURSE. >> THANK YOU FOR RUSHING OVER\nHERE FROM THE PANEL.

THAT'S PROBABLY THE REASON\nMARKETS ARE STRUGGLING IN THE NEAR TERM.\nWE GOT TO A POINT WHERE 57% OF ADVISERS WERE SUGGESTING THEY\nWERE BULLISH ON THE OUTLOOK. THAT'S PEAKISH LEVELS.\nLONGER TERM THERE'S STILL A VERY HEALTHY DEGREE OF SKEPTICISM,\nRIGHT? SHORT-TERM MOVES, WE GET REALLY\nBULLISH. WE GOT UP TO NEW HIGHS IN JULY,\nBUT LONGER TERM IT'S REALLY HARD TO GET A VERY STRONG LONG BULL\nCASE IN THE FACE OF TREMENDOUSLY SLOW ECONOMIC GROWTH AND A FED\nTHAT IS INCHING TOWARD TIGHTER POLICY AND A LACK OF BELIEF THAT\nOTHER CENTRAL BANKS CAN REALLY CONTINUE TO ACCOMMODATE TO\nINFLATE MULTIPLES. >> WHEN YOU SAY IT'S HARD TO\nFIND A LONG BULL CASE, YOU MEAN LONG THE MARKET OR LONG TERM?\n>> LONG TERM. >> IF SO HOW LONG TERM?\n>> LONGER TERM. WE'RE SO MANY YEARS INTO THIS\nCYCLE, RIGHT? THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY HAS GONE\nON SINCE 2010. THE MARKET HAS BEEN RECOVERING\nSINCE 2009. YOU GET LONG IN THE TOOTH.\nINVESTORS START TO GET NERVOUS. AT THE SAME TIME, MONETARY\nPOLICY GETTING TIGHTER, INVESTORS ARE A BIT NERVOUS.\nWE'RE ULTIMATELY GOING TO FALL INTO RECESSION THE NEXT THREE TO\nFIVE YEARS. AND HOW DO YOU POSITION FOR\nTHAT? WE'VE ALREADY SEEN SUCH A\nLONG-TERM BULL MARKET. HOW DO YOU CONTINUE TO ADOPT\nTHAT LONGER-TERM TREND? THAT'S WHAT'S CREATING THIS SORT\nOF SKEPTICISM. >> COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO\nLOOK AT THAT, THOUGH. ONE THING IS TO SAY THINGS\nOVERALL ARE GOING TO GET WORSE. YOU KNOW, THE CONSUMER ISN'T\nFEELING THESE NUMBERS THAT WE SEE FROM 2015 THAT SUGGEST, YOU\nKNOW, INCOME UP 5.2%. PRETTY GOOD.\nANOTHER WAY TO LOOK AT IT, THE CONSUMER IS GOING TO FEEL IT\nSOON. THERE'S ALL THIS PESSIMISM\nAROUND THE ELECTION CYCLE. POLITICIANS ARE TRYING TO DRUM\nTHIS UP. REALLY THINGS AREN'T THAT BAD\nAND IT'S GOING TO SHOW UP LATER. WHICH WAY DO YOU LEAN?\n>> CASH STORY IS SO IMPORTANT. TOO MANY INVESTORS ARE HOLDING\nCASH AND THE FED ISN'T MAKING IT EASY ON ANYONE.\nFRIDAY THERE ARE RISKS TO WAITING TOO LONG AND THE NEXT\nTRADING DAY, THERE ARE RISKS TO GOING TOO SOON.\nTHAT'S THE SAME THING, RIGHT? THAT'S NOT MAKING IT EASY.\nFOR US, GOVERNMENT YIELDS ARE PROBABLY TOO LOW.\nCREDIT STILL LOOKS OKAY. AND FOR FOLKS THAT WERE TEASED\nINTO THE FACT THAT VALUE STOCKS MAY BE SAFE, THAT'S THE RICHEST\nPART OF THE MARKET, RIGHT? THAT'S THE MARKET WE'RE TELLING\nFOLKS TO HAVE SOME CAUTION ON. BUT FOR US, FROM AN ASSET\nALLOCATION PERSPECTIVE, THE FED IS NOT MAKING IT EASY.\nIN THE NEAR TERM THEY'RE GOING TO GO THIS YEAR.\nIN THE LONGER TERM THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GO AS MUCH.\nTHAT'S THE KEY FOR THINGS LIKE THE DOLLAR, MERGING MARKETS,\nWHICH MAKE US BULLISH NOW. >> WHEN YOU SAY THEY'RE GOING TO\nGO THIS YEAR, YOU'RE NOT BANKING ON SEPTEMBER OR ARE YOU?\n>> SOME PEOPLE WERE SAYING SAME OLD JETS OVER THE WEEKEND, SAME\nOLD FED. THE FED HAS ALWAYS WAITED A\nQUARTER WHEN THEY -- WHEN FOLKS THINK THEY WANT IT TO GO.\nLOOK AT LAST YEAR. SEPTEMBER WASN'T REALLY 50%\nPRICING. SOME PEOPLE WERE SAYING YES.\nTHEY POINTED TO DECEMBER AS GOING.\nI THINK THAT'S WHAT THEY DO. THEY GO IN DECEMBER, NOT IN\nFRONT OF THE ELECTION. BUT ULTIMATELY, THAT LEVEL OF\nFED FUND RATE, PACE IS GOING TO BE LOWER.\n>> ARE YOU ON BOARD WITH DECEMBER?\n>> WE THINK DECEMBER AS WELL. THERE'S NO JUSTIFICATION TO GO\nIN SEPTEMBER GIVEN THE WEAKENING IN DATA AND LABOR MARKET INDEX\nIS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT THING.\n>> THAT WON'T STOP PEOPLE FROM TALKING ABOUT IT.\n>> ABSOLUTELY. >> IF JANET YELLIN WERE A REAL\nLEADER SHE WOULD CUT OFF THE MIKES RIGHT NOW.\nSHOULD SHE BE STIFLING THIS COMMENTARY?\n>> LIKE GREENSPAN BEFORE HER. HE NEVER ALLOWED THIS TO HAPPEN.\nIT'S CONFUSING FOR THE MARKETS. NEXT TRADING DAY YOU HAD\nSOMEBODY OFFSET WHAT WAS SAID BEFORE.\nWAY TOO MUCH INFORMATION. FED GOT THEMSELVES INTO THIS BY\nPUBLISHING ALL THIS TRANSPARENCY, DOTS, INFLATION\nFORECASTS. I THINK THAT'S PUT THEM IN A\nTOUGH SITUATION. >> WE ASKED FOR TRANSPARENCY.\nWE GOT T I CAN TELL YOU THAT. >> UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.\n>> FOR BETTER OR WORSE. GINA, PHIL, THANK YOU FOR THAT.\nGOOD TO SEE YOU. >>> WE CONTINUE TO WATCH THE\nMARKETS. DOW IS DOWN 211.\nWE ARE GETTING BREAKING NEWS.",

HE LIKES BEING FEATURED IN THE\nSPOTLIGHT. >> WELL, THERE'S THIS\nREPRESENTATION, THIS IMPRESSION OF DONALD TRUMP GIVING HUNDREDS\nOF INTERVIEWS, WHICH IS TRUE OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR, BUT\nTHIS SUMMER AND INTO THE FALL NOW, HE'S BEEN A LOT MORE\nWITHHOLDING. MOSTLY GOING ON FOX NEWS, GOING\nTO FRIENDLY OUTLETS. HE HASN'T BEEN DOING AS MUCH\nPRESS. MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE HE DOESN'T\nWANT TO BE ASKED AGAIN AND AGAIN, WHERE ARE YOUR TAX\nRETURNS? I THINK THIS IS A PROUD MOMENT\nFOR THE PRESS. WE'RE REALLY ACTING AS A CHECK\nAND BALANCE ON THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH BY DEMANDING MORE\nINFORMATION FROM BOTH THESE CANDIDATES.\n>> WE'RE TRYING TO DO THAT.

THEY NEED THE COVERAGE.\nTHEY WANT TO PUT THEIR STORY OUT.\nTHEY NEED TO APPEAR APPROACHABLE AND ACCOUNTABLE.\nTHIS CYCLE, HOWEVER, THEY'RE MORE BUTTONED DOWN THAN WE'VE\nEVER SEEN. WHY HILLARY CLINTON GAVE NO NEWS\nCONFERENCES, SAT FOR NO INTERVIEWS, APPEARED TO BE\nCALLED OFF FOR SO LONG, IS ANYBODY'S GUESS.\nI THINK IT WILL PROVE TO BE A MISTAKE.\nDONALD TRUMP IS, YOU KNOW, APPEARS TO BE KIND OF WINGING IT\nWHEN HE WINGS IT, ALTHOUGH HE'S DOING A LOT LESS OF THAT NOW.\nBUT THE ACTUAL SPONTANEOUS INTERACTION THAT THE CANDIDATES\nHAVE THROUGH THE MEDIA, WITH THE PUBLIC, IS VERY, VERY MINIMAL\nRIGHT NOW. THAT'S WHY THE DEBATES ARE GOING\nTO BE SO IMPORTANT. >> AT THE END OF THE DAY, I CAN\nHEAR CLINTON SUPPORTERS SCREAMING AT THE TV RIGHT NOW\nSAYING WE'RE HOLDING HER TO A HIGHER STANDARD.\nTHERE IS THIS ISSUE OF COVERAGE OF THIS COMING ACROSS AS\nHOSTILE. I THINK WE HAVE TO BE SENSITIVE\nTO THAT, EVEN THOUGH WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING BY CALLING FOR\nMORE INFORMATION FROM ALL THESE CANDIDATES.\n>> I THINK THERE IS ONE THING. THERE'S AN ISSUE OF\nPROPORTIONALITY HERE. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO PUT OUR\nBRAINS AROUND. HILLARY CLINTON WAS NOT\nFORTHCOMING WITH HER PNEUMONIA. WHAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT DONALD\nTRUMP, THOUGH, IS MUCH BIGGER, MUCH BROADER, AND MUCH MORE\nIMPORTANT. HOW MUCH MONEY CAME FROM THE\nRUSSIANS INTO HIS BUSINESS? WHO ACTUALLY WAS FUNDING HIS\nFOUNDATION? HOW MUCH MONEY HAS HE REALLY\nGIVEN AWAY? WHAT IS BEHIND ALL OF HIS\nBANKRUPTCIES? THESE GO WAY BEYOND PNEUMONIA.\nBY THE WAY, AS FAR AS HEALTH IS CONCERNED, HE'S 70, SHE'S 6.\nFAIR FAIR. >> BRIAN, FRANK, THANK YOU VERY\nMUCH. WHAT'S YOUR TAKE OUT THERE?\nTWEET US @NEWDAY OR POST YOUR COMMENT ON FACEBOOK.COM/NEWDAY.\nCHRIS? >> TRANSPARENCY MATTERS.\nWORDS MATTER. SAYING 50% OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS\nARE DEPLORABLE WAS WRONG.

IN MY OPINION.\nHER YALE LAW SCHOOL CLASSMATE WAS LANNIE DAVIS.\nHE WROTE A GREAT BOOK ABOUT CRISIS MANAGEMENT WITH THREE\nMANTRA IN IT, WHICH WAS TO SAY TELL IT EARLY, TELL IT ALL, AND\nTELL IT YOURSELF. SHE'S VIOLATED THAT CODA.\nI DON'T KNOW HOW SHE MADE IT THROUGH THAT INTERVIEW WITH\nCHRIS, BY THE WAY. BUT THEN TO SET UP THE SCENARIO\nWHERE ON FRIDAY WE ALL LEARNED THE DETAILS AND NOT UNTIL HOURS\nAFTER. SHE'S HER OWN WORST ENEMY IN\nCIRCUMSTANCES LIKE THIS. AND WHAT IT DOES IS REINFORCES\nTHE LIABILITIES THAT HER CAMPAIGN POSSESSES ABOUT LACK OF\nTRUSTWORTHINESS. BY THE WAY, ONE FINAL POINT.\nEVERYTHING SHE SAID TO ANDERSON LAST NIGHT ABOUT TRUMP IS TRUE.\nHE OUGHT TO RELEASE HIS TAXES. HE OUGHT TO RELEASE HIS HEALTH\nRECORDS. THEY BOTH SHOULD.\n>> SO WHY DOESN'T SHE GO THE FULL BERNSTEIN?\nWE HAD CARL BERNSTEIN ON THE SHOW.\nHE SAYS THE REMEDY FOR HILLARY AND WHAT WOULD HURT TRUMP THE\nMOST IS GO FULL TRANSPARENCY. HOLD THESE PRESS CONFERENCES OUT\nTHE WAZOO. GIVE THE SPEECHES FROM WALL\nSTREET. GIVE EVERYTHING AND SHOW THIS IS\nTHE KIND OF PRESIDENT I'LL BE. THE SUSPICION IS YOU CAN'T TRUST\nME. HERE.\nHERE'S EVERYTHING. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW, AND\nI'LL GIVE IT TO YOU. TRUMP WON'T.\nWHY DOESN'T SHE PLAY IT THAT WAY IF YOU'RE GOING TO ASK THEM TO\nDO IMPOSSIBLE THINGS? >> FIRST OF ALL, I LIKE CARL'S\nADVICE. I AGREE WITH IT.\nI THINK IT RUNS CONTRARY TO HER DNA AND PROBABLY TO HIS AS WELL,\nMEANING BILL'S. THEY REALLY ARE OF A MIND SET\nTHERE'S A VAST RIGHT-WING CONSPIRACY.\nPART OF THAT IS TRUE. THERE IS, BUT IT GETS FUELED BY\nTHE WAY IN WHICH THEY HANDLE THESE SORT OF CIRCUMSTANCES.\nI THINK THAT'S PROBABLY A BRILLIANT STRATEGY THAT SHE\nIMMEDIATELY NOW BE FORTHCOMING WITH EVERYTHING AND SHINE THE\nSPOTLIGHT BACK ON HIM. >> ALL RIGHT, MICHAEL.\nTHANKS. ALWAYS GREAT TO GET YOUR TAKE ON\nALL OF THIS. THANKS FOR BEING HERE.\n>> SO LET'S GO INTO THIS IDEA THAT MICHAEL WAS TEEING UP FOR\nUS HERE ABOUT THE TRANSPARENCY AND THE NATURE OF THESE\nCANDIDATES. LET'S LOOK AT IT IN THE CONTEXT\nOF HISTORY. THERE'S NO QUESTION THERE'S\nSTILL MAJOR QUESTIONS ABOUT BOTH TRUMP AND CLINTON.\nARE THEY GOING TO BE MORE OPEN AFTER THE SCRUTINY OF THIS WEEK?\nTWO OF THEIR SUPPORTERS FROM CONGRESS ARE GOING TO DEBATE\nWHETHER OR NOT THESE TWO ARE THE LEAST TRANSPARENT CANDIDATES\nWE'VE EVER HAD. >>> WELL, I JUST DIDN'T THINK IT\nWAS GOING TO BE THAT BIG A DEAL. COMPARE EVERYTHING YOU KNOW\nABOUT ME WITH MY OPPONENT. I THINK IT'S TIME HE MET THE\nSAME LEVEL OF DISCLOSURE THAT I HAVE FOR YEARS.\n>> QUESTIONS OF TRANSPARENCY PLAGUING BOTH CANDIDATES.\nHILLARY CLINTON UNDER FIRE FOR NOT DISCLOSING HER PNEUMONIA\nDIAGNOSIS WHILE DONALD TRUMP HAS REFUSED TO RELEASE ANY MEDICAL\nRECORDS OR TAX RETURNS. LET'S DEBATE THIS WITH TENNESSEE\nCONGRESSWOMAN MARSHA BLACKBURN AND DEBBIE DINGELL.\nGREAT TO SEE BOTH OF YOU. YOU'RE BOTH GOING TO MAKE YOUR\nCASE FOR YOUR CANDIDATE. CONGRESSWOMAN DINGELL, LET ME\nSTART WITH YOU. SHOULD HILLARY CLINTON HAVE\nDISCLOSED TO THE PRESS AND THE PUBLIC ON FRIDAY THAT SHE WAS\nDEALING WITH PNEUMONIA? >> SHE PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE IN\nRETROSPECT. I HOPE SHE REALIZES THAT.\nBUT I'M ALSO GOING TO SAY TO YOU, I THINK THAT WE'RE MAKING\nMUCH ADO ABOUT A LOT RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF HER ACTUAL HEALTH.\nI'M A WOMAN OF HER GENERATION, A FEW YEARS YOUNGER.\nI'M TELLING YOU THAT FOR MY ENTIRE CAREER, YOU POWER\nTHROUGH. IF I WAS SICK, I MEAN, I HAD\nMAJOR SURGERY AND WAS BACK AT WORK IN THREE OR FOUR DAYS\nBECAUSE THAT'S JUST WHAT YOU DO. AND, YOU KNOW, STEPPING UP INTO\nVANS, I TRIP GETTING INTO THE STOOL HERE THAT I'M SITTING IN\nBECAUSE IT'S HIGH. SO YES, SHE'S GOT TO JUST\nUNDERSTAND EVERYBODY'S MICROMANAGING WHAT HER HEALTH\nIS. BUT I ALSO WANT TO KNOW WHY\nWE'RE NOT SCREAMING AS LOUD ABOUT DONALD TRUMP.\nSHE HAS MADE MORE RECORDS AVAILABLE THAN ANY CANDIDATE IN\nHISTORY. WE DON'T KNOW DONALD TRUMP'S\nMEDICAL HISTORY. >> HOLD ON.\nSHE HASN'T MADE MORE MEDICAL RECORDS.\nI'M HOLDING WHAT SHE'S MADE AVAILABLE.\nIT'S TWO PAGES. EVERY ONE OF THE PREDECESSORS\nHAS MADE MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE MEDICAL RECORDS AVAILABLE THAN\nSHE HAS. >> SHE HAS OVER THE YEARS.\nNOW SHE GETS IT. SHE'S GOING TO BE RELEASING\nMORE. DONALD TRUMP'S WAS LIKE A\nNANOSECOND WORTH. AND NOT EVEN A REPORT ON WHAT\nHIS HEALTH REALLY IS. SO I THINK BOTH OF THEM NEED TO\nBE HELD TO THE SAME STANDARD. IF SHE SNEEZES, SHE NEEDS TO\nTELL US IT'S A SNEEZE OR AN ALLERGY OR WHATEVER IT IS.\n>> CONGRESSWOMAN BLACKBURN, LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS LETTER\nDONALD TRUMP RELEASED. ONE PAGE, FOUR PARAGRAPHS.\nHOW IS THIS TRANSPARENT? >> WELL, I THINK ONE OF THE\nTHINGS THAT YOU ARE SEEING IS THAT IN THIS DAY AND AGE,\nALISYN, PEOPLE ARE WANTING TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT\nARE ON THE BALLOT. THAT CAN BE A VERY GOOD THING.\nI UNDERSTAND THAT MR. TRUMP HAS SAID HE HAS RECENTLY HAD A\nMEDICAL EXAM AND IS GOING TO RELEASE THAT INFORMATION, BUT\nGOING BACK TO HILLARY CLINTON, I DO THINK WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS\nTHROUGH THE YEARS THERE HAS BEEN THIS PATTERN OF, IF YOU WILL, A\nDECEPTIVE ATTITUDE OF HIDING THINGS, WHETHER IT'S THE CLAINTN\nFOUNDATION OR THE E-MAILS AND WHAT TRANSPIRED THERE OR THE\nBENGHAZI SITUATION.

HOW CAN YOU BE PRESIDENT -- HOW\nCAN YOU BE PRESIDENT FOR SO MANY PEOPLE?\nSHE TALKS ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE THEY'RE OBJECTS, NOT HUMAN\nBEINGS. >> Reporter: AND AS THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN TRIES TO GO ON THE OFFENSIVE, HIS RUNNING MATE MIKE\nPENCE IS CAUSING THEM TO PLAY SOME DEFTS.\nPENCE GETTING A LITTLE HEAT FOR HIS INTERVIEW ON CNN WHERE HE\nWAS ASKED ABOUT SOME OF THEIR SUPPORT THE CAMPAIGN HAS\nATTRACTED FROM WHITE NATIONALISTS, INCLUDING FROM\nDAVID DUKE, A FORMER KKK LEADER. NOW, PENCE DID DISAVOW DAVID\nDUKE SUPPORT, BUT HE REFUSED TO CALL HIM DEPLORABLE.\nHERE'S WHAT HE TOLD WOLF BLITZER.\n>> I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHY THE MEDIA KEEPS DROPPING DAVID\nDUKE'S NAME.

AND A TRUMP CAMPAIGN OFFICIAL\nTELLS ME THAT DONALD TRUMP WILL KEEP UP THESE ATTACKS ON HILLARY\nCLINTON OVER THIS DEPLORABLE COMMENT.\nTODAY AT HIS EVENT IN IOWA AND LATER TODAY WE WILL SEE THE\nRETURN OF HIS DAUGHTER IVANKA TRUMP.\nSHE'LL BE BACK OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL CAMPAIGNING WITH\nHIM IN PENNSYLVANIA.

FIRST YOU, CHRISTINE.\nLET'S PUT THAT AXELROD TWEET BACK UP.\nOBVIOUSLY NOT AN ENEMY OF THE CLINTONS.\nHE RAN THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN AGAINST HER IN 2008.\nANTIBIOTICS CAN TAKE CARE OF PNEUMONIA.\nTRUE, DEPENDING WHAT KIND. WHAT'S THE CURE FOR AN UNHEALTHY\nPENSION FOR PRIVACY THAT REPEATEDLY CREATED UNNECESSARY\nPROBLEMS? MY SUGGESTION IS THIS IS NOT\nABOUT HER HEALTH. WE HAVE NO PROOF TO QUESTION HER\nHEALTH IN ANY LEGITIMATE WAY. HOWEVER, WE HAVE A LOT OF PROOF\nTO QUESTION THE NATURE OF TRANSPARENCY WITH THIS CANDIDATE\nAND HER CAMPAIGN. YOU ONLY GET TO KNOW WHAT THEY\nWANT YOU TO KNOW WHEN THEY WANT YOU TO KNOW IT.\nFAIR CRITICISM? >> WELL, I THINK YOU COULD SAY\nTHE FINAL PART OF WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT MOST CANDIDATES OUT THERE,\nRIGHT, THAT THEY TELL US THE INFORMATION.\nI THINK IF ANYBODY HEARD SECRETARY CLINTON LAST NIGHT ON\nANDERSON COOPER, SHE MADE SOME VERY GOOD POINTS.\nSHE DIDN'T THINK THIS WAS A BIG DEAL.\nSHE THOUGHT SHE COULD POWER THROUGH IT.\n>> SAID THE SAME THING ABOUT THE SERVER.\nJUST SAYING, JUST FOR AN ANALOGY.\nYOU KNOW, I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE, I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS THAT\nBIG A DEAL, THE CONTROL OF INFORMATION, THE CONCERN OF\nWHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO HER IF IT GETS OUT FUELS ALMOST A\nPARANOIA. THAT'S THE CRITICISM.\n>> BUT LET ME JUST SAY ONE THING.\nI RESPECT HILLARY CLINTON IN SAYING, I'M GOING TO GO TO THE\n9/11 MEMORIAL, EVEN THOUGH MAYBE THE DOCTORS SAID I SHOULD REST.\nI THINK THAT'S SOMETHING TO BE RESPECTED.\n>> ME TOO. I DID THE INTERVIEW WITH HER ON\nFRIDAY. WE TALKED ABOUT HEALTH.\nWE'RE BOTH ALLERGY SUFFERERS. SHE DIDN'T MENTION PNEUMONIA.\n>> SHE MAY NOT HAVE KNOWN. >> SHE'S GOT A GREAT ENGINE.\nI'M NOT DISPUTING THAT. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE\nTRANSPARENCY. >> I BELIEVE AS SECRETARY\nCLINTON SAID LAST NIGHT, WHETHER IT'S ALL OF THE E-MAILS THAT ARE\nNOW OUT, WHETHER IT'S THE MEDICAL INFORMATION SHE'S PUT\nOUT FROM A DOCTOR WHO HAS ACTUAL PRIVILEGES IN NEW YORK CITY,\nWHICH YOU CANNOT SAY ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S DOCTOR, ALL OF\nTHE TAXES, ALL OF THAT THAT'S OUT THERE IS BEYOND IN SOME\nCASES AN ETHIC STANDARD OF WHAT'S EXPECTED OF A\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. AND YOU CANNOT SAY THAT ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP. JUST TO TELL YOU, WE SEE REPORTS\nIN \"THE WASHINGTON POST\" OF PHANTOM DONATIONS FROM THE TRUMP\nFOUNDATION. >> WE'LL COVER THAT.\nWE HAVE THE WRITER FOR \"THE WASHINGTON POST\" ON SHOW TODAY.\n\"NEW DAY\" HAS BEEN ALL OVER THIS STORY.\nWHAT ARE YOU TAKING EXCEPTION TO?\n>> TO THE FACT SHE SELECTIVELY DISCLOSES WHAT IS IN HER\nINTERESTS. BUT THINGS SHE'S REQUIRED BY LAW\nTO DISCLOSE, THE FEDERAL RECORDS ACT REQUIRES SHE PRESERVES HER\nE-MAILS, HER AIDES TOOK HAMMERS TO THE BLACKBERRIES AND BLEACHED\nTHE SOFTWARE FROM HISTORY. SHE CAN SELECTIVELY DISCLOSE\nTHINGS. SHE'S NOT REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE\nHER MEDICAL RECORDS. WHY DESTROY DOCUMENTS YOU'RE\nREQUIRED BY LAW TO PRESERVE? >> USING THE PHRASE REQUIRED BY\nLAW WOULD IMPLY THAT SOME LAW HAD BEEN BROKEN.\n>> THE FEDERAL RECORDS ACT WAS BROKEN.\n>> WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, AS A LAWYER, THE HEAD OF THE FBI, A\nMAN WHO YOU CANNOT QUESTION HIS RECORD, HAS SAID NO LAW WAS\nBROKEN. >> HOLD ON.\nLET ME PAUSE. JUST FOR YOU AT HOME WHO ARE\nFOLLOWING THIS, YOU'RE IN LAW SCHOOL, YOU'RE A LAWYER.\n>> I'M NOT A LAWYER. >> I'M A LAWYER.\nJUST SO YOU KNOW. THE FEDERAL RECORDS ACT WAS\nARGUABLY VIOLATED BY WHAT SHE DID.\nTHAT IS A STATE DEPARTMENT GUIDELINE THAT THEY WOULD\nENFORCE. SHE WAS OUT OF OFFICE WHEN ALL\nTHIS CAME OUT. SO THEY COULD NOT ENFORCE THAT.\nIT BEING ILLEGAL IS A TERM OF ART THAT WOULD APPLY TO THE\nFEDERAL. THAT'S WHAT THE FBI WAS LOOKING\nAT. THEY FOUND NO BASIS TO PROSECUTE\nTHIS CASE. IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A COME PLEK\nISSUE. >> YES, ABSOLUTELY.\nBUT I WANT TO BE CLEAR. THE DIRECTOR HAS SAID, THE FBI\nDIRECTOR, NO LAWS WERE BROKEN. >> HE CALLED HER EXTREMELY\nCARELESS. >> BEYOND THAT, LOOK AT HIS\nRECORD. WHAT IS NECESSARY FOR\nPRESIDENTIAL DISCLOSURE, WHICH IS A GREAT LITTLE TWIST THERE BY\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, IS NOT THE SAME THING AS A LEGAL STANDARD.\nSINCE RICHARD NIXON, EVERY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HAS\nDISCLOSED THEIR TAXES. I'M NOT SAYING DONALD TRUMP IS\nLEGALLY BOUND TO DO THAT. I'M SAYING HE'S ETHICALLY BOUND\nTO DO THAT. >> LET'S PICK UP THAT PART OF\nTHE BALL. LET'S TAKE THIS IN PIECES.\nWITH THESE TWO CAMPAIGNS, THERE'S A LOT TO TALK ABOUT WHEN\nIT COMES TO TRANSPARENCY. LET'S NOT OVERWHELM THE\nAUDIENCE. FAIR CRITICISM, TRUMP HAS NOT\nGIVEN THE KINDS OF DISCLOSURES WE'RE USED TO SEEING.\nTHE DEFENSE IS, HE'S A PRIVATE CITIZEN.\nI FIND THAT UNSATISFYING. THE FOUNDATION GOING ON RIGHT\nNOW, THE CRITICISM, HE COULD DUMP A TON OF INFORMATION TO\nPROVE WHAT MIKE PENCE IS SAYING. ALL HE HAS TO DO IS RELEASE HIS\nTAXES. CHARITABLE GIVING WOULD BE IN\nTHERE. HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO IT.\nIS HE TO BLAME FOR QUESTIONS OF HIS OWN TRANSPARENCY?\n>> NO, I DON'T THINK SO. HE'S NOT REQUIRED TO RELEASE HIS\nTAXES. IF HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO SO, HE\nDOESN'T HAVE TO. WE KNOW HE'S PAID TAXES WITHIN\nTHE BOUNDS OF LAW. >> HOW DO WE KNOW?\n>> HE SURVIVED NEARLY A DOZEN AUDITS.\n>> WHY ARE THEY AUDITING HIM IF IT'S SUCH A CLEAR QUESTION?\n>> MANY BILLIONAIRES AND MILLIONAIRES ARE AUDITED.\n>> MANY OF THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO CHEAT THE SYSTEM.\n>> DONALD TRUMP HAS SURVIVED NEARLY A DOZEN AUDITS.\nHE'S PAYING TAXES WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF THE LAW.\n>> BY THE WAY, HAVE YOU SEEN PROOF HE'S BEING AUDITED RIGHT\nNOW? >> NO, WE DON'T KNOW THAT, BUT\nWE TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD. >> DO YOU THINK THAT'S ODD?\nSHOW US THE IRS LETTER. >> I CAN PROMISE YOU THIS.\nTHE POLITICIZED IRS WHO WENT AFTER TEA PARTY GROUPS USING THE\nFEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD SOMEHOW FIND A WHAAY TO LET US KNOW.\n>> SHE SAID DONALD TRUMP DISCLOSES WHAT HE WANTS TO.\nHE'S NOT LEGALLY BOUND TO DISCLOSE HIS TAXES.\nSO THE QUESTION POPS INTO MY MIND.\nWHAT IS HE HIDING IF HE DOESN'T DISCLOSE THEM?\nAND WHY DOES HE ONLY TELL US WHAT HE WANTS US TO KNOW AND\nCLAIMS HE'S TRANSPARENT? >> THAT'S THE SAME QUESTION\nPEOPLE HAVE ABOUT YOUR CANDIDATE.\n>> SHE'S DISCLOSED 40 YEARS OF HER TAXES.\n>> BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING SHE WANTED US TO KNOW.\n>> YOU CANNOT SAY DONALD TRUMP IS GIVING EVERYTHING IF YOU THEN\nSAY HE ONLY GIVES WHAT HE WANTS, WHICH IS WHAT IS IN HIS BEST\nINTEREST. LET'S GO TO HIS FOUNDATION.\nTHIS IS AN ENTITY WE DON'T -- WE BELIEVE HE'S GIVEN NO MONEY TO,\nBUT WE DON'T KNOW THAT BECAUSE HE WON'T TELL US, SINCE 2008.\nTHE FOUNDATION GAVE AN ILLEGAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE FLORIDA\nATTORNEY GENERAL WHO THEN STEPPED DOWN ON HER\nINVESTIGATIONS INTO TRUMP UNIVERSITY.\nTHERE ARE NOW REPORTS IN \"THE WASHINGTON POST\" THAT HE USED\nFOUNDATION FUNDS TO BUY ITEMS FOR HIMSELF, WHICH IS ILLEGAL,\nAT BEST. >> WE'RE GOING TO PICK THIS UP\nLATER IN THE SHOW. A QUICK REBUTTAL FROM YOU.\n>> \"WASHINGTON POST,\" THIS IS PROOF OF HORRENDOUS JOURNALISM.\nYOU HAVE THE REPORTER COMING ON. THAT MONEY WENT TO BREAST\nCANCER, WHICH I THINK IS A GREAT CAUSE AN A WORTHY CAUSE FOR A\nFOUNDATION TO DONATE TO. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FIVE\nDISCLOSURES WITHIN HIS FOUNDATION, MANY OF WHICH CAN BE\nPROVEN OFF AS MERELY CLERICAL ERRORS, VERSUS THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION, WHERE SHE MET HALF OF THE DONORS IN NONGOVERNMENT\nMEETINGS. IT WAS A REVOLVING DOOR OF\nCORRUPTION. IF YOU DONATED TO THE\nFOUNDATION, YOU GOT ACCESS TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT.\n>> CORRUPTION IMPLIES THAT WE HAVE PROVEN OR SHOWN PAY FOR\nPLAY. THIS IS ANOTHER SITUATION THAT\nWAS INVESTIGATED BY THE FBI, WHICH IS PART OF THE CLINTON\nDEFENSE. MY GET INVESTIGATED ALL THE TIME\nABOUT STUFF. TRUMP NEVER HAS.\nWHAT IF IT WERE ON HIM? THEY FOUND NO PROOF OF WHAT YOU\nCALL CORRUPTION. CORRUPTION MEANS SOMETHING.\nIT DOESN'T MEAN SMELLS BAD. MEANS IT IS BAD.\n>> SINCE CHRISTINE BRINGS UP THE FBI AND LOVES THE DIRECTOR SO\nMUCH, THE FBI DIRECTOR HAS RECOMMENDED ONE FOUNDATION BE\nINVESTIGATED. THAT'S THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nTHE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DECLINED TO INVESTIGATION.\nTHE FBI RECOMMENDED INVESTIGATION OF THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION. >> WE DON'T KNOW WHO IN THE N\nBI. LET'S GO BACK TO THE SUSAN G.\nKOMEN THING. I DON'T WANT TO THROW AROUND\nBREAST CANCER SURVIVORS AS SOME CLOAK FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nHE WAS TOTALLY ALLOWED TO GIVE FOUNDATION MONEY TO A GOOD\nGROUP, BUT HE DOESN'T GET TO TAKE THE ITEM.\n>> WE DON'T KNOW IF HE HAS THE ITEM.\nHAVE YOU SEEN THE ITEM? >> HE PURCHASED THE ITEM.\nTHIS IS A PATTERN OF ILLEGAL OF WHAT APPEARS TO BE ILLEGAL\nACTION IN THE TRUMP FOUNDATION. YOU CAN'T COVER IT UP.\nTHERE'S NONE OF HIS MONEY THERE SINCE 2008.\nSO HE'S PERFECTLY HAPPY TO GIVE OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY AWAY TO\nCANDIDATES, THE FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL, WHICH IS CLEARLY\nSOMETHING NOT ALLOWED, AND HE WAS FINED FOR THAT\nSIGNIFICANTLY. >> ALL RIGHT.\nON THE FOUNDATION AGAIN, \"NEW DAY\" IS TAKING THIS UP WITH THE\nWRITER FROM \"THE WASHINGTON POST.\"\nWE'LL VET THAT STORY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR MAKING\nTHE CASES FROM THE RESPECTIVE CAMPAIGNS.\nALISYN? >> WELL, HILLARY CLINTON AND\nDONALD TRUMP ARE IN THE FINAL STRETCH OF THE 2016 RACE.\nSO WHAT DO EACH OF THE CAMPAIGNS NEED TO DO TO WIN?\nMICHAEL SMERCONISH HAS SOME FREE ADVICE NEXT.

I HEAR YOU MOANING.\n>> I DON'T THINK ANYONE THINKS HILLARY CLINTON HAS GOTTEN A\nFREE PASS, IF ANYTHING I THINK PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO MAKE\nEQUIVALENT TO ARGUMENTS LIKE WE JUST HEARD KAYLEIGH DO ABOUT\nTHEIR PERSONAL ACTIVITIES OVER THE YEARS BUT HERE'S THE\nINTERESTING THING BECAUSE I HEAR MY FRIEND S.E'S FRUSTRATION IN\nHER VOICE WHICH IS ONE OF MY OTHER FAVORITE LINES OF\nPRESIDENT OBAMA THIS YEAR WAS WHEN HE GAVE A SPEECH RECENTLY\nAND SAID \"NOW SOME PEOPLE MIGHT WANT TO PICK SOMETHING OFF THE\nMENU BUT WE GOT FISH OR WE GOT STEAK, YOU HAVE TO PICK ONE, YOU\nHAVE TO ENGAGE.\" THAT'S WHY HIS ARGUMENT TODAY\nABOUT THIS IS -- DEMOCRACY IS NOT A SPECTATOR SPORT, YOU HAVE\nTO GET INTO THE ARENA, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE STAKES THAT\nARE IN PLAY HERE AND FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING TO MATTER THE\nMOST. SO IF YOU'RE FOR NOT RAISING THE\nMINIMUM WAGE, IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THE PROGRESS AND DECISIONS\nTHE SUPREME COURT HAVE MADE, IF YOU WORRY ABOUT HEALTH CARE\nYOU'RE GOING TO BE FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS PROMISED TO BRING PEOPLE BACKWARDS ON THE\nECONOMY, ON PROGRESSIVE ISSUES, ON LEGAL AND EQUAL RIGHTS SO\nIT'S FISH OR STEAK, THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE.\nELECTIONS ARE ABOUT CHOICES. >> ON THE ECONOMY WHEN YOU\nLISTEN TO THESE TWO DIFFERENT CANDIDATES AS WE HAVE FROM\nMONTHS AND MONTHS THEY PAINT TWO VERY DIFFERENT PICTURES OF\nAMERICA BUT DAVID CHALIAN IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT THE FACTS WE\nGOT FROM THE U.S. CENSUS BUREAU, THIS IS SOMETHING THE PRESIDENT\nTOUTED AS HE SAID CHANGE WOULD COME AND IT'S POSITIVE NEWS FOR\nHIM AND THE PRO SERB Y'ALL THIRD TERM IF THERE WERE TO BE A\nPRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON THAT THE MEDIAN INCOME IN THE U.S. IS\nUP. YOU HAVE TO NUMBERS ON THE\nSCREEN. HOW WILL THIS PLAY FOR THE\nDEMOCRATS? >> SO YOU SEE THE TREND THAT IT\nHAD BEEN TRENDING UP, RIGHT? WHAT YOU SEE THERE, THAT LINE.\nNOW IT'S AT A LEVEL WHERE, YOU KNOW, IT WAS HIGHER, IT'S THE\nFASTEST WE'VE SEEN IT CLIMB IS WITH THE STATISTIC.\nMY QUESTION IS ARE PEOPLE FEELING THAT?\nWE'VE TALKED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THESE ECONOMIC STATISTICS\nWE'VE SEEN, MONTH-TO-MONTH UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, WHAT HAVE\nYOU, YET WE KNOW THERE IS A TON OF ECONOMIC STRIFE IN THE\nCOUNTRY AND PEOPLE AREN'T NECESSARILY FEELING IT.\nNOW THAT THE MEDIAN INCOME IS ON THE RISE, ARE PEOPLE FEELING\nTHAT IN A WAY? I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THAT\nANSWER BUT THAT IS THE POTENTIAL FOR A ELECTORAL IMPACT.\n>> ON DAVID'S POINT, THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.\nTHERE WAS A MOMENT DURING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S CAMPAIGN RALLY\nWHERE HE SAID $2 NATIONAL GAS, THANKS, OBAMA.\nAND IT'S A CUTE LINE AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE APPRECIATE $2\nGLASS BUT IT'S ALSO GLIB WHEN I DON'T THINK EVERYONE FEELS THE\nEFFECT OF AN IMPROVING ECONOMY AND I THINK OBVIOUSLY IN HILLARY\nCLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP PEOPLE ARE FRUSTRATED.\n>> MORE THAN TWO-THIRDS OF AMERICANS THINK WE'RE ON THE\nWRONG TRACK.

YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT A MEDICAL\nREPORT ON ME THAT MEETS THE SAME STANDARD AS MITT ROMNEY AND\nBARACK OBAMA. DONALD TRUMP'S DOCTORS SAID HE'D\nBE THE HEALTHIEST PRESIDENT IN HISTORY.\nTHAT'S JUST NOT EVEN SERIOUS. AND I'VE RELEASED NEARLY 40\nYEARS OF TAX RETURNS. HE HASN'T RELEASED ONE.\nTHIS IS A MAN WITH UNKNOWN NUMBERS, OF PARTNERS AND\nINVESTORS WHO SAYS HE'S DOING 120 FOREIGN DEALS.\nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE TO KNOW WHAT HE'S UP TO AND WHAT HE\nIS HIDING SO IF WE WEREN'T -- IF WE WEREN'T FAST ENOUGH, I'VE\nTALKED TO MY STAFF. WE -- WE, YOU KNOW, TAKE\nRESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT, BUT THE INFORMATION IS OUT THERE.\nYOU CAN'T SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP.\n>> DONALD TRUMP FOR HIS PART IS TRYING TO CAPITALIZE ON\nCLINTON'S, QUOTE, BASKET OF DEPLORABLES COMMENT.\nHE IS CLAIMING THAT SHE HAS CONTEMPT FOR EVERYDAY AMERICANS.\nHIS RUNNING MATE, MIKE PENCE, IS MAKING HEADLINES OF HIS OWN FOR\nREFUSING TO CALL FORMER KKK LEADER DAVID DUKE DEPLORABLE.\nCNN'S SUNDAY LAND SERFATY HAS THAT FOR US.\n>> GOOD MORNING. THEY ARE TRYING TO KEEP THE\nSPOTLIGHT VERY FOCUSED ON HILLARY CLINTON'S GAFFE.\nTRUMP HIGHLIGHTED THIS WHERE HE CALLED UP A GROUP OF SUPPORTERS\nONTO THE STAGE TO GIVE SOMETHING OF PENCE TESTIMONIALS AS TO WHY\nTHEY THINK THEY'RE NOT DEPLORABLES.\n>> AFTER MONTHS OF HIDING FROM THE PRESS HILLARY CLINTON CAME\nOUT AND FINALLY TOLD THE WORLD HOW SHE FEELS ABOUT THE PEOPLE\nOF THIS COUNTRY. SHE SAID TENS OF MILLIONS OF\nPATRIOTIC AMERICANS ARE A BASKET OF DEPLORABLES.\nHOW CAN YOU BE PRESIDENT -- HOW CAN YOU BE PRESIDENT FOR SO MANY\nPEOPLE? SHE TALKS ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE\nTHEY'RE OBJECTS, NOT HUMAN BEINGS.\n>> Reporter: AND AS THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN TRIES TO KEEP UP THE\nOFFENSE ON THIS, HIS RUNNING MATE, MIKE PENCE IS CAUSING THEM\nTO PLAY SOME DEFENSE. PENCE GETTING SOME HEAT FOR HIS\nINTERVIEW ON CNN WHEN HE WAS ASKED ABOUT SOME OF THE SUPPORT\nTHEY HAVE ATTRACTED FROM WHITE NATIONALISTS, INCLUDING FROM\nDAVID DUKE. PENCE DISAVOWED HIS SUPPORT BUT\nHE REFUSED TO CALL HIM DEPLORABLE.\nHERE'S WHAT HE TOLD WOLF BLITZER.\n>> I'M NOT SURE WHY THE MEDIA KEEPS DROPPING DAVID DUKE'S\nNAME. WE DON'T WANT HIS SUPPORT OR THE\nPEOPLE WHO -- >> YOU WOULD CALL HIM A\nDEPLORABLE? >> NO.\nI'M NOT IN THE NAME-CALLING BUSINESS, WOLF.\nYOU KNOW ME BETTER THAN THAT. >> Reporter: AND THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN, THEY HAVE POUNCED RIGHT ON THAT TWEETING OUT,\nQUOTE, IF YOU WON'T SAY THE KKK IS DEPLORABLE, YOU HAVE NO\nBUSINESS RUNNING THE COUNTRY. AND A TRUMP CAMPAIGN OFFICIAL\nTELLS ME TRUMP WILL KEEP UP THE ATTACKS ON HILLARY CLINTON OVER\nALL OF THIS TODAY AT HIS EVENT IN IOWA.\nLATER WE WILL SEE HIS DAUGHTER, IVANKA TRUMP, RETURN TO THE\nCAMPAIGN TRAIL IN PENNSYLVANIA. THIS WILL BE ONE OF THE FIRST\nBIG APPEARANCES SINCE HER CONVENTION SPEECH.\n>> SUNDAY SUNLEN, THANK YOU FOR THAT.\n>> WHO'S BEEN MORE TRANSPARENT ABOUT THEIR HEALTH, HILLARY\nCLINTON OR DONALD TRUMP? >> AS WE KNOW FROM THIS PAST\nWEEKEND, CLEARLY DONALD TRUMP. WE SAW HILLARY CLINTON WITH HER\nOWN TWO EYES STRUGGLING THE OTHER DAY.\nWE CERTAINLY HOPE AND MR. TRUMP AND OUR ENTIRE CAMPAIGN HOPE SHE\nIS WELL. >> SHE HAS SAID SHE WAS\nSUFFERING FROM PNEUMONIA. SHE GOT THE DIAGNOSIS.\nTHIS IS ALL MR. TRUMP HAS RELEASED ABOUT HIS HEALTH.\nFOUR PARAGRAPHS AS YOU KNOW FROM HIS GASTROENTEROLOGIST WHO SAYS\nHIS HEALTH IS A SSTONISHINGLY IRRELEVANT.\nALL OF HIS TEST RESULTS WERE POSITIVE.\n>> WOW, YOU CAN LAUGH ALL YOU WANT AT THE MEDICAL REPORT, BUT\nAS FAR AS I CAN SEE, THERE ARE TWO MAJOR PARTY CANDIDATES\nRUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AND ONLY ONE OF THEM HAS PNEUMONIA AND\nLIED ABOUT IT, ESPECIALLY TO THE PRESS BECAUSE SHE ALWAYS TREATS\nYOU ALL LIKE SECOND CLASS CITIZENS.\nSHE PRETENDS TO HAVE PRESS AVAIL.\nGOING TO BE UPLIFTING AND ASPIRATIONAL.\nTHEN GOES ON TO ATTACK TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS THE VERY\nNEXT DAY. >> BUT ABOUT HEALTH.\nTHIS IS NOT A MEDICAL REPORT. >> ALISYN, THIS IS WHAT I EXPECT\nFROM THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN. I DON'T EXPECT IT FROM\nJOURNALISTS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HILLARY\nCLINTON AND HER PNEUMONIA AND WHAT HAPPENED ON 9/11 WHICH WE\nALL SAW WITH OUR OWN TWO EYES AND IT TAKES US ABOUT TEN WORDS\nTO GET TO DONALD TRUMP. HE HAD A PHYSICAL LAST WEEK.\n>> YES. AND WILL YOU BE LEASING THE\nRESULTS OF THAT? >> YES.\nHE SAID HE'LL RELEASE THEM THIS WEEK OR WHENEVER THE DOCTOR HAS\nTHE REPORT PREPARED. >> WHAT EXACTLY WILL HE BE\nRELEASING? HIS ENTIRE MEDICAL HISTORY OR\nJUST THE RESULTS OF THE LAST CHECKUP?\n>> I DON'T KNOW BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT HE WON'T BE RELEASING?\nHE WON'T BE RELEASING THE FACT THAT HE DIDN'T --\n>> LIED OR DIDN'T DISCLOSE? >> I GUESS LYING AND DIDN'T\nDISCLOSE IS SO DIFFERENT, RIGHT? IT'S ALWAYS PARSING THE WORDS.\nEXCUSE ME, RESPECTFULLY, ONE PERSON IS OFF THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL\nRIGHT NOW. WE WISH HER WELL.\nWE'RE GLAD SHE TOLD ANDERSON COOPER LAST NIGHT THAT SHE'S\nFEELING BETTER, THAT SHE PLANS TO REJOIN THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\nTHE IDEA SHIFTING IMMEDIATELY TO THE PERSON KEEPING THE MOST\nPUNISHING SCHEDULE OF ANY CANDIDATE.\nHE'LL BE IN SEVEN OR EIGHT SWING STATES.\nFIVE RALLIES. TODAY HE'S ON HIS WAY TO IOWA\nAND THEN PENNSYLVANIA. TOMORROW IS OHIO AND ANOTHER\nSTATE. SO, IN OTHER WORDS, OHIO,\nMICHIGAN TOMORROW. IN OTHER WORDS, WE CAN TALK\nABOUT THAT BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT STAMINA AND ENERGY.\nTHE IDEA THAT SHE HASN'T HAD THE WORST 48 HOURS OF HER CAMPAIGN\nTHAT PEOPLE WOULD COVER UP, I THINK IS ASTONISHING.\n>> YOU'RE HER CAMPAIGN MANAGER. WE HAVE PEOPLE ON FROM THE\nCLINTON CAMP AND THEY ASKED ABOUT HER.\n>> THEY TALK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. >> LOOK, FOR STAMINA.\nTHEY BOTH KEEP UP A PUNISHING -- >> NO, TALKING ABOUT HIS.\nNO, NO, I'M SORRY. LOOK AT THEIR PUBLIC SCHEDULE.\nTHAT IS NOT TRUE. SHE ATTENDS MANY FUNDRAISERS.\nIN FACT, THAT'S WHY SHE WAS GOING TO CALIFORNIA.\nTHE MINUTE DONALD TRUMP DARES TO STEP IN A STATE, ALISYN, THAT'S\nEITHER OVERLY RED OR 0E6R8LY BLUE, THE MEDIA CNN SAYS WHY IS\nHE IN A NONSWING STATE? SHE GOES TO CALIFORNIA TO\nHOLLYWOOD TO RAISE MONEY. DID IT TWICE, SUPPOSED TO BE\nTHERE NOW. DID IT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO,\nTHEN SHE WENT TO HAMPTONS, MARTHA'S VINEYARD, NONE OF WHICH\nIS ARE SWING STATES. THAT'S OKAY.\nWHERE ARE HER RALLIES? PENSACOLA, FLORIDA, 12,500\nPEOPLE, 8, 10,000 PEOPLE WAITING OUTSIDE TO GET IN.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S TAX RECORDS.\nWHEN CAN WE EXPECT TO SEE THEM? >> WHEN HIS LAWYERS AND HIS\nACCOUNTANTS TELL THEM HE SHOULD RELEASE THEM WHEN HE'S NO LONGER\nUNDER AUDIT. HE'S VERY CLEAR.\n>> HAS DONALD TRUMP OR WILL HE RELEASE ANYTHING FROM THE IRS,\nPROVING THAT HE'S UNDER AUDIT? >> I'M SORRY?\n>> WILL DONALD TRUMP RELEASE ANYTHING FROM THE IRS PROVING\nTHAT HE'S UNDER AUDIT? >> ARE YOU CALLING HIM A LIAR?\nWE'RE TAKING HER WORD THAT SHE WAS OVERHEATED, DIDN'T HAVE\nPNEUMONIA. SHE'S GOING TO START TALKING TO\nTHE PRESS AGAIN. SERIOUSLY, WE'RE RUNNING AGAINST\nA CLINTON AND WE'RE GOING TO CHALLENGE SOMEONE'S VORACITY.\n>> THE LEADER OF LINKED-IN IS GOING TO GIVE VETERANS $5\nMILLION IF DONALD TRUMP RELEASES HIS TAX RETURNS.\nTHAT'S A CAUSE CLOSE TO MR. TRUMP'S HEART.\nWILL THIS BE AN IMPETUS FOR HIM DESPITE WE KNOW WHAT HIS LAWYERS\nHAVE SAID. THE IRS SAID HE CAN RELEASE IT.\nTEY WILL NOT PUNISH HIM. LOTS OF TAX ATTORNEYS SAID THEY\nCAN. WILL HE RELEASE IT NOW GIVEN\nTHIS MOTIVATION? >> NO.\nI HOPE THAT THAT MAN THINKS SO MUCH OF THE VETERANS THAT HE\nWOULD GIVE THEM $5 MILLION WHETHER OR NOT MR. TRUMP DEFIES\nTHE ADVICE OF HIS LAWYER AND HIS ACCOUNTANT AND RELEASES HIS\nTAXES. I ALSO WOULD LOVE TO TELL YOU,\nI'VE LOOKED AT CNN POLLING, EVERYBODY'S POLLING, OUR OWN\nPOLLING I CAN'T FIND WHERE THIS IS A BURNING ISSUE TO MOST OF\nTHE AMERICANS. IT GOES BACK TO WHAT HILLARY\nCLINTON SAID. TO BE SO DISMISSIVE OF TENS OF\nMILLIONS OF AMERICANS ALSO MEANS THAT PEOPLE -- PEOPLE AROUND\nHERE AND ELSEWHERE THINK THAT SOMEHOW THE ISSUES THAT ARE\nVEXING AMERICANS ARE NOT ECONOMY, JOBS, TERRORISM, HEALTH\nCARE, IMMIGRATION, EDUCATION. EXACTLY WHAT WE TELL THE CNN\nPOLLSTERS. WHY DON'T WE HAVE A DISCUSSION\nABOUT THAT? WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT TAXES?\nWHAT WILL OUR TAX BURDEN BE UNDER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP?\nHE HAS GIVEN A 4 OR 5 POINT MIDDLE CLASS TAX RELIEF PLAN.\nWE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT TAX REFORM IN PENNSYLVANIA.\nACTUALLY, A VERY EXCITING ASPECT OF IT.\nTHEN HE'LL BE AT THE ECONOMIC -- >> THE ISSUE GOES TO\nTRANSPARENCY. THE ISSUE GOES TO TRANSPARENCY\nAND IF VOTERS CAN BANK ON WHAT THEY ARE VOTING ON AND KNOWING\nYOUR CANDIDATE. FOR INSTANCE, MIKE PENCE, VP\nNOMINEE, SAID YESTERDAY THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS GIVEN AWAY TENS\nOF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO CHARITY, BUT INVESTIGATIONS\nCAN'T FIND HIS PERSONAL MONEY THAT HAS -- IS IN THE TENS OF\nMILLIONS. DO YOU STAND BY THE TENS OF\nMILLIONS NUMBER? >> DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN\nINCREDIBLY GENEROUS OVER THE COURSE OF HIS OWN LIFE?\n>> WITH HIS OWN MONEY WHICH IS HIS MONEY.\n>> NO, THE FOUNDATION'S MONEY ARE OTHER PEOPLE'S.\n>> OKAY. HE'S BEEN INCREDIBLY GENEROUS.\n>> ARE WE GOING TO ACTUALLY QUESTION HILLARY CLINTON AND HER\nHUSBAND MADE ALMOST A QUARTER OF A BILLION AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO\nJUST QUESTION -- AND THAT'S OKAY.\nIT'S OKAY THAT -- >> BUT WHY ISN'T HE A\nBILLIONAIRE. DONALD TRUMP HAS TAUTED IT TOO.\nWHY IS THAT A SHORT COMING? >> EXCUSE ME?\nIT'S NOT A SHORT COMING. I'M A CAPITALIST.\nI WISH SHE WOULD RESPECT THE HARD WORKING MEN AND WOMEN WHO\nSHE THINKS ARE UNEDUCATED RUDES COMING DOWN FROM THE HILLS.\nTHEY NEED TO BE SCHOOLED BY THIS PRECIOUS WOMAN IN NEW YORK AT\nTIPRIANNI WHO ARE LAUGHING AT AMERICANS.\nDO WE REALLY WANT A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO LAUGHS AT\nAMERICANS? I DON'T.\nI FIND IT DISGRACEFUL. I GREW UP AROUND LABOR BORE\nLISTS. I THINK HER INSULTING TENS OF\nMILLIONS OF AMERICANS JUST BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A YALE\nLAW DEGREE LIKE SHE DOES, JUST BECAUSE THEIR HUSBAND DOESN'T\nMAKE A HALF MILLION TO GIVE A SPEECH 45 MINUTES SOMEWHERE,\nJUST BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GIVE MINERAL RIGHTS TO THEIR FRIENDS\nIN FAR AWAY COUNTRIES WHEN THEY ARE SECRETARY OF STATE AND THE\nOTHER PART OF HER COMMENT WAS ALSO OFFENSIVE.\nLET'S TALK ABOUT THE OTHER HALF OF THE HALF, ALISYN SAYING\nPEOPLE ARE DESPERATE FOR CHANGE. BOY, DO I AGREE WITH HER.\nVERY DESPERATE FOR CHANGE. WHO'S BEEN IN CHARGE OF THE\nECONOMY FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS.\n>> PART OF WHY PEOPLE ARE CALLING FOR HIM TO RELEASE HIS\nTAXES SO WE DO KNOW HOW MUCH HE HIMSELF HAS GIVEN TO CHARITY.\nWILL YOU OR THE CAMPAIGN RELEASE EXACTLY WHAT THAT NUMBER IS?\nAND THE REASON I ASK -- >> I DOUBT IT.\n>> WHY WOULD YOU DOUBT IT? >> I DOUBT IT.\nTHIS IS LIKE BADGERING. I DON'T SEE IT AS JOURNALISM, I\nSEE IT AS BADGERING. WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION SO\nMANY DIFFERENT TIMES ON SO MANY DIFFERENT NETWORKS YET WE'RE NOT\nHAVING CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT THE MIDDLE CLASS TAX RELIEF\nWOULD MEAN FOR PEOPLE'S WAGE STAGNATION.\n>> WE DO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AT OTHER TIMES BUT HOW IS IT\nBADGERING TO ASK FOR THE EVIDENCE OF A CLAIM?\nIF MIKE PENCE IS SAYING TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM DONALD\nTRUMP, SHOULDN'T WE SEE THE EVIDENCE?\n>> DID ANYBODY ASK HILLARY CLINTON FOR EVIDENCE THAT SHE\nWAS OVER HEATED AND DEHYDRATED? IS ANYBODY ASKING HER FOR\nEVIDENCE OF WHY SHE THINKS SHE'S SO PRECIOUS AND SPECIAL THAT SHE\nWOULD HAVE THE SECRET SERVICE BREAK PROTOCOL AT GROUND ZERO ON\nSUNDAY, ALISYN, AND TAKE HER TO HER DAUGHTER'S APARTMENT RATHER\nTHAN A HOSPITAL? WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE.\nTHIS NETWORK AND OTHER NETWORKS WHERE PRESUMPTIVELY PROTECTING\nHER -- >> THAT'S NOT FAIR, KELLYANNE.\nANDERSON COOPER GOT THE EXCLUSIVE.\nI DON'T BUY THAT. WE ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS OF THE\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN BUT WHEN YOU'RE HERE REPRESENTING THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN WE ASK THESE QUESTIONS. YOU CAN'T MAKE CLAIMS AND EXPECT\nEVERYONE TO ACCEPT IT. SO THE IDEA THAT --\n>> I THINK DONALD TRUMP'S A VERY GENEROUS MAN.\n>> YES, AND WHAT'S THE EVIDENCE? >> TO HAVE EMPLOYED TENS OF\nTHOUSANDS OF PEOPLE FROM MANY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, BOTH\nGENDERS CERTAINLY, FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE.\nOVER THE YEARS. >> SURE, BUT THAT'S NOT CHARITY.\nEMPLOYMENT IS NOT CHARITY. >> IT'S PRETTY DARN IMPRESSIVE\nAND IT ISN'T THE POLITICAL RESUME THAT HIS OPPONENT HAS.\nI WOULD RESPECTFULLY PLAY. WE LOVE TO PLAY A PARLOR GAME AT\nTRUMP TOWERS. IT TAKES THE AVERAGE CLINTON\nSURROGATE OR CAMPAIGN STAFFER TEN SECONDS OR TEN WORDS TO TALK\nABOUT DONALD TRUMP WHEN YOU ASK THEM A QUESTION ABOUT HILLARY\nCLINTON AND I CAN'T BLAME THEM. IF SHE WERE MY CANDIDATE, I\nWOULDN'T WANT TO TALK MUCH ABOUT HER EITHER.\n>> BUT YOU ARE TALKING A LOT ABOUT HER.\n>> YOU'RE DARN RIGHT. SO AT LEAST WE HEAR ABOUT HER\nTODAY. TRANSPARENCY AND TRUSTWORTHINESS\nARE HER TWO PILLAR PROBLEMS AND SHE DID NOTHING THE WHOLE LAST\nWEEK. I THINK SHE HAD A TERRIBLE WEEK.\nSHE CERTAINLY HAD A TERRIBLE WEEKEND.\nNOT BECAUSE SHE'S SICK. LET ME REPEAT.\nWE'RE GLAD SHE SAID SHE'S FEELING BETTER.\nWE HOPE SHE'S FULLY RECOVERING AND COMES BACK TO THE CAMPAIGN\nTRAIL. WHY THE CONCEALMENT?\nWHAT'S THE BIG DEAL JUST TO SAY, I HAVE PNEUMONIA AND I'M ON\nANTIBIOTICS. WHY DIDN'T SHE TELL HER RUNNING\nMATE. WHAT AN EMBARRASSMENT FOR HIM TO\nCOME OUT. TUESDAY I READ ON THE HILL, SHE\nDOECHT NEED TO APOLOGIZE FOR HER COMMENT.\nIT'S SO ODD THEY CAN'T LET THE RUNNING MATE KNOW WHAT'S GOING\nON. WHY IS THAT?\n>> SHOULD DONALD TRUMP'S RUNNING MATE MIKE PENCE HAVE SAID THAT\nDAVID DUKE IS DEPLORABLE? >> HE SHOULD -- SURE.\nSO THAT -- SO THAT HE DOESN'T GET HEADLINES SAYING MIKE PENCE\nWILL NOT SAY DONALD TRUMP IS DEPLORABLE AND PEOPLE CAN GET\nSATISFIED? CAN PEOPLE PLAY THE ENTIRE CLIP.\nTHANK YOU FOR PLAYING THAT ENTIRE CLIP.\nWE DON'T WANT TO SUPPORT. WE DON'T LIKE WHAT HE STANDS FOR\nOR PEOPLE STAND FOR IN THE KKK. HE HAS ANOTHER POIBL.\nTHERES A CERTAIN OBSESSION ABOUT CONSTANTLY RAISING ISSUES AND\nRAISING PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT PART OF OUR CAMPAIGN THAT WE HAVE\nSAID AND REINCE PRIEBUS, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN\nNATIONAL COMMITTEE HAS SAID, WE DON'T WANT HIS SUPPORT.\nWE DON'T WANT PEOPLE LIKE THAT. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.\nWILL HILLARY CLINTON DISAVOW -- DOES SHE THINK KERMIT GOSSELIN\nIS DEPLORABLE? KILLING BLACK BABIES IN\nPHILADELPHIA. DOES SHE THINK PEOPLE CALLING\nCOPS PIGS IN A BLANKET AND ASKING FOR THEIR DEATH\nDEPLORABLE? I SHOULD DO.\nWE CAN GO NAME AFTER NAME. I'LL SIT HERE BETWEEN NOW AND\nELECTION DAY. WE WON'T GET TO THE TENS OF\nMILLIONS OF PEOPLE HILLARY CLINTON WAS REFERRING TO BY\nCALLING THEM DEPLORABLE. SHE WAS REFERRING TO HARD\nWORKING MEN AND WOMEN. IT WASN'T A GAFFE.\nPLEASE, PRINT JOURNALISTS, STOP CALLING IT A GAFFE.\nSHE WAS READING IT FROM PREPARED REMARKS AS SHE ALWAYS DOES.\n>> KELLYANNE ARE YOU SATISFIED ABOUT THE LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY\nFROM YOUR CANDIDATE? >> I AM REALLY SATISFIED WITH\nIT. I AM SATISFIED THAT HE IS OUT\nTHERE WITH VOTERS EVERY DAY. THEY EXPECT HIM.\nTHEY DESERVE IT. I TRAVEL WITH HIM.\nTHE COUNTY FAIR HE AND GOVERNOR PENCE WERE TOGETHER IN OHIO.\nIT WAS ASTONISHING TO SEE PEOPLE EIGHT AND TEN DEEP AT A COUNTY\nFAIR TO SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, THEY DON'T SAY MAY I HAVE YOUR\nAUTOGRAPH, THEY SAY I LOVE YOU, WILL YOU SAVE MY COUNTRY.\nTHEY SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING THE SACRIFICE OF RUNNING.\nYOU KNOW WHAT I APPRECIATE, I APPRECIATE THAT I'M RUNNING FOR\nA PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WHO'S NOT A POLITICIAN, WHO DID NOT\nNEED TO DO THIS. PEOPLE IN POLITICS RUN FOR FAME,\nFORTUNE, STATUS, HE HAD ALL OF THAT.\nHE HAS ALL OF THAT. IT'S A TREMENDOUS SACRIFICE FOR\nHE AND HIS FAMILY TO DO THAT. THAT'S ONE OF THE UNTOLD\nSTORIES. WHO THINKS THEY'VE EARNED IT,\nDESERF IT, IT'S THEIR TURN. DARN IT, YOU BETTER GET BEHIND\nME. I'M QUALIFIED.\nYOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS A QUALIFICATION?\nINTEGRITY AND TRANSPARENCY. >> YES, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT\nTRANSPARENCY, A LOT THIS MORNING, AND DEMANDING IT FROM\nBOTH CANDIDATES. >> THANK YOU.\n>> THANKS FOR BEING HERE. >> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.\n>> LET'S GET THE OTHER SIDE. JOINING US NOW IS CLINTON\nSUPPORTER AND FORMER NATO SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER GENERAL\nWESLEY CORK. ALWAYS A PLEASURE.\nI DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE MILITARY SPECIFICALLY.\nTHE CAMPAIGN, WE WERE TRYING TO GET THEM ON TO COUNTER WHAT'S\nOUT THERE RIGHT NOW IN THE STATE OF PLAY AND WE GOT YOU SO I'VE\nGOT TO PUT TWO HATS ON YOU THIS MORNING.\nIS THAT OKAY? >> FINE.\nI'M NOT WORKING WITH THE CAMPAIGN ON THESE ISSUES.\n>> RIGHT. >> BUT I'M A VERY ACTIVE\nSUPPORTER OF HILLARY CLINTON. I'VE KNOWN HER FOR YEARS.\nI THINK SHE HAS HIGH INTEGRITY. I THINK SHE'LL BE A GREAT\nPRESIDENT. WE HAVE TO GET HER INTO OFFICE.\n>> KELLYANNE CONWAY USED AN INTERESTING WORD, FURTIVE.\nDO YOU THINK THAT APPLIES TO HILLARY CLINTON?\n>> ABSOLUTELY NOT. EVERY PERSON WHEN YOU GET UP IN\nTHE MORNING, IS THIS GOING TO BE A GOOD DAY, A BAD DAY, HOW DO\nYOU FEEL? WHEN YOU'RE IN A POLITICAL\nCAMPAIGN YOU'RE USUALLY TIRED. MAYBE DONALD TRUMP ISN'T TIRED\nBECAUSE HE'S COMING BACK TO NEW YORK AND TAKING IT EASY EVERY\nNIGHT. THAT'S WHAT WE HEAR.\nBUT HILLARY CLINTON'S WORKED HER REAR END OFF FOR THE LAST YEAR\nAND A HALF ON THIS CAMPAIGN AND I KNOW I DID THIS FOR FIVE\nMONTHS. I KNOW HOW TIRED I WAS AND I\nKNOW SHE'S TIRED. AND SO SHE'S NOT GOING TO GET UP\nEVERY MORNING, GEE, TODAY I FEEL 86% TIRED.\nYESTERDAY I WAS 84% TIRED. AND SHE'S NOT GOING TO SAY THOSE\nTHINGS. SO OF COURSE SHE TRIED TO POWER\nTHROUGH THIS. >> YOU'VE MAINTAINED MILITARY\nDISCIPLINE. YOU'RE IN GREAT SHAPE.\nDON'T YOU THINK THESE CANDIDATES SHOULD BE MORE FORTHCOMING ABOUT\nTHEIR MEDICAL HISTORY GIVEN THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE THE MOST\nPOWERFUL PERSON IN THE WORLD? >> SHE'LL RELEASE HER MEDICAL\nRECORDS, BUT I THINK MR. TRUMP REALLY OUGHT TO BE MORE\nFORTHCOMING ABOUT HIS TAX RETURNS AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY.\nTHIS IS THE BIGGEST ISSUE. BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE PRESIDENT OF\nTHE UNITED STATES THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT YOU TO HAVE ONE\nOVERRIDING INTEREST AND PRIORITY AND THAT'S THE GOOD OF THE\nCOUNTRY. AND WHEN I RAN FOR OFFICE I HAD\nTO GIVE UP ALL MY BOARDS, ALL MY PAID ENGAGEMENTS, EVERYTHING.\nSO THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO PERCEPTION, NO CHANCE OF A\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST. TRUMP'S STILL IN BUSINESS.\nWE KNOW FROM RIDING THE RECORDS A LOT OF THOSE BUSINESSES HAVE\nHAD RUSSIAN MONEY IN THEM APPARENTLY.\nAND MAYBE THE RUSSIANS HAVE LOANED HIM MONEY.\nIF IT'S A LOT OF MONEY, MAYBE IT STAYS UP TO MR. PUTIN.\nWE DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS CONNECTIONS ARE WITH RUSSIA.\nAS SOMEONE WHO SERVED IN THE MILITARY SINCE THE 1960s AND WAS\nTHERE DURING THE COLD WAR, I WAS THE NATO COMMANDER TURNED OUT WE\nHAD A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH RUSSIA DURING THE OPERATION TO\nSTOP ETHNIC CLEANSING IN KOSOVO. WHAT IS THE CONNECTION?\nWHERE ARE MR. TRUMP'S LOYALTIES AND IF HE WANTS TO CLEAR THOSE\nUP, HE NEEDS TO RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS.\n>> HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS HE HAS THE BIGGEST ADVANTAGE IN BEING\nPRESIDENT VERSUS HILLARY CLINTON WHEN IT COMES TO INTEGRITY.\nDO YOU ACCEPT THAT GIVEN THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT\nRIGHT NOW AND ABOUT PUTIN BEING A BETTER LEADER THAN OBAMA.\nDO YOU BELIEVE THAT'S HIM BEING A TRUTH TELLER?\nDO YOU BELIEVE THAT GIVES HIM THE ADVANTAGE OF INTEGRITY?\n>> LET'S LOOK AT MR. PUTIN FIRST, THE FACTS.\nTHIS IS A GUY WHO JAILS HIS OPPONENTS, KEEPS THEM OUT OF\nCONGRESS. PEOPLE GET KILLED.\nMAYBE HE'S WORTH $200 BILLION. HOW DO YOU MAKE $200 BILLION IF\nYOU'RE THE LEADER OF A COUNTRY? SO WHAT KIND OF INTEGRITY IS\nTHAT ON THE PART OF MR. PUTIN. THEN IF YOU'RE THE PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATE, HE'S A GREAT LEADER BUT HE'S CERTAINLY NOT THE KIND\nOF LEADER AMERICA WANTS. YOU BELIEVE HE'S GOT 82% -- IF I\nWERE IN RUSSIA I'D SAY PUTIN WAS A GREAT LEADER, TOO, BECAUSE I\nWOULDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER AND I'D BE AFRAID.\nIT'S ABOUT INTEGRITY. IT'S ALSO ABOUT JUDGMENT AND\nIT'S ABOUT HIDDEN MOTIVES. THAT'S FINE COMING BACK TO THE\nTAX ISSUE. YOU WON'T RELEASE YOUR TAX\nRETURNS, CHRIS, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING\nWHAT ARE THE OTHER POLLS ON YOU? HE SHOULD BE OUT OF HIS\nBUSINESS. MR. TRUMP SHOULD BE SAYING,\nLOOK, I WANT TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nHERE'S MY TAX RETURNS. LOOK AT THEM.\n>> AND THE CRITICISM OF CLINTON ON THE SAME LEVEL OF\nTRANSPARENCY IS WE ONLY KNOW THINGS WHEN CONGRESS\nINVESTIGATES, OTHERWISE THE CAMPAIGN OR HILLARY CLINTON\nHERSELF OR THE CLINTONS TOGETHER WON'T LET YOU KNOW THINGS THAT\nDO SPEAK TO THE INTEGRITY OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN\nLEADERSHIP, I.E.,, AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE SAW WITH THE FOUNDATION.\n>> WAIT A MINUTE WAIT A MINUTE. I'VE BEEN WITH THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION AND THE CLINTON GLOBAL INITIATIVE SINCE IT\nSTARTED. I'VE BEEN TO EVERYONE OF THESE\nMEETINGS, I'VE MET ALL OF THESE PEOPLE.\nIT'S A WONDERFUL GATHERING OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO DO THINGS\nTOGETHER TO CHANGE THE WORLD AND IT'S PUT TENS OF MILLIONS OF\nDOLLARS INTO THINGS LIKE HEALTH CARE AND CHILDREN'S EDUCATION.\n>> AND TREATMENT FOR 2/3 WHO RECEIVE IT.\n>> BILL CLINTON GETS NOTHING FROM TNCHTS THERE ARE DIFFERENT\nARMS TO IT. IF YOU WERE SECRETARY OF STATE\nWOULD YOU HAVE HAD THAT KIND OF CONNECTION ACCEPTING MONEY FROM\nFOREIGN ACTORS THE WAY IT WAS WITH CLINTONS.\n>> HILLARY CLINTON WAS SECRETARY OF STATE, BILL CLINTON WAS\nRUNNING THE FOUNDATION. SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO\nWITH THE FOUNDATION OTHER THAN COMING THERE AT THE CLINTON\nGLOBAL INITIATIVE ONCE OR TWICE OR GIVING A SPEECH.\n>> YOU WOUND UP HAVING THE SAME PEOPLE IN BOTH PLACES, RIGHT?\n>> THOSE PEOPLE WERE NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS AND THEY WEREN'T DOING\nBUSINESS WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE COME IN AND TALK TO PEOPLE IN THE STATE\nDEPARTMENT. THAT AP STORY YOU'RE REFERRING\nTO, CHRIS, EVERYBODY WHO'S LOOKED AT THAT STORY SAID THE\nHEADLINES WERE -- >> THEY OVER REACHED.\n>> THEY PULLED IT BACK. >> ABSOLUTELY.\nIT DOESN'T MEAN THE QUESTIONS DON'T EXIST, THAT'S WHY I'M\nASKING YOU, GENERAL. ALSO, THE IDEA OF --\n>> I THINK THE ANSWER TO THOSE QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN OUT THERE.\nTHEY'VE BEEN SET ASIDE. I MEAN, IT'S TIME TO MOVE PAST\nTHOSE QUESTIONS. I WANT TO GET BACK TO THE REAL\nISSUES OF THE CAMPAIGN. AS AN AMERICAN I WANT TO KNOW\nWHAT THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY LOOKS LIKE AND WHAT WE'VE HAD\nFROM MR. TRUMP IS NOT A REAL COHERENT VIEW OF FOREIGN POLICY\nAND THE ECONOMIC PROGRAM, THEY JUST DON'T MAKE SENSE.\nHE TALKS ABOUT TAX CUTS. LET'S TALK ABOUT TAX CUTS.\nWHEN KENNEDY CUT TAXES IN 19 -- IN THE EARLY 1960s, THE TOP\nMARGINAL TAX RATE WAS 91%.

FROM A MEDICAL PERSPECTIVE, WHAT\nDO YOU MAKE OF WHAT WE HEARD AND SAW ON SUNDAY?\n>> WHAT THE CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN SAYING, THEY ATTRIBUTE THAT\nENTIRE EPISODE WHERE YOU SAW HER HAVING THE DIFFICULTY GETTING TO\nTHE VAN ON THIS DEHYDRATION DUE TO PNEUMONIA PRIMARILY.\n>> DOES PNEUMONIA LEAD TO DEHYDRATION?\n>> IT CAN. YOU CAN HAVE A FEVER.\nA FEVER CAN LEAD TO DEHYDRATION. THE INFECTION, ITSELF, CAN CAUSE\nDEHYDRATION. IN ADDITION, YOU MAY TO THE BE\nEATING AND DRINKING AS MUCH BECAUSE YOU DON'T FEEL WELL.\nSHE MENTIONED IT WAS A WARM DAY OUTSIDE.\nALL THOSE THINGS IN COMBINATION. SHE ALSO EARLIER BEFORE THEY\nTALKED ABOUT THE PNEUMONIA, ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE FACT SHE'S ON A\nCOUPLE OF MEDICATIONS. A THYROID MEDICATION WHICH CAN\nINCREASE YOUR HEAT INTOLERANCE. A DECONGESTANT.\nIT DRIES UP YOUR SINUSES BUT CAN CAUSE DEHYDRATION.\nA COMBINATION OF THINGS. IT'S PLAUSIBLE ALL THOSE THINGS\nTOGETHER COULD CAUSE THE PROFOUND DEHYDRATION.\nYOUR BLOOD PRESSURE DROPS. ATHLETES CALL IT BONKING.\nYOU'RE NO LONGER ABLE TO KEEP YOUR BALANCE.\nIT IS POSSIBLE. SHE'S SAYING THE SAME THING NOW\nTHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM THE CAMPAIGN TWO DAYS AFTER SHE WAS\nDIAGNOSED. NEVERTHELESS, THE SAME THING.\n>> TO HER POINT THAT SHE'S BEEN MORE TRANSPARENT IN TERMS OF HER\nMEDICAL HISTORY THAN DONALD TRUMP, YOU'VE LOOKED AT BOTH THE\nRELEASES FROM THE CAMPAIGNS. IS THERE TRUTH TO WHAT SHE SAYS?\n>> I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT COMPARED TO DONALD TRUMP, HER\nMEDICAL LETTER, IF YOU WILL, IS A TWO-PAGE LETTER, IT DOES GO\nBACK FURTHER. IT HAS MORE OBJECTIVE DATA IN\nIT, YOU KNOW, IN TERMS OF LAB RESULT, MEDICATIONS SHE'S ON,\nHOW LONG SHE'S BEEN ON THEM, THINGS LIKE THAT.\nTHERE IS MORE DATA. GO BACK TO 2008, FOR EXAMPLE,\nWITH SENATOR McCAIN, THAT WAS FAR MORE COMPREHENSIVE.\nI WAS ONE OF THE REPORTERS ALLOWED TO LOOK AT THOUSAND\nPAGES LITERALLY OF HIS RECORD FOR HOURS.\nHE WAS TRANSPARENT ABOUT IT AT THE TIME.\nWE DIDN'T GET TO ACTUALLY REMOVE THOSE MEDICAL RECORDS AND THEY\nWEREN'T MADE PUBLIC. WE COULD EXAMINE THEMSELVES OUR\nFOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID SHOULD THAT\nBE THE STANDARD? BACK BEFORE THAT WHEN GEORGE W.\nBUSH AND JOHN KERRY WERE RUNNING AGAINST EACH OTHER IN 2004,\nTHERE WASN'T A BIG CLAMORING FOR MEDICAL RECORDS.\nTHEY LOOKED PRETTY YOUNG, HEALTHY.\nTHAT HAS CHANGED. THERE'S A GREATER DEMANDS NOW.\n>> SOMETHING LIKE PNEUMONIA, PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT WALKING\nPNEUMONIA, THERE'S DIFFERENT KINDS.\nHOW LIKELY IS IT THAT SHE CAN GET BACK ON THE TRAIL WITHIN A\nMATTER OF DAYS? >> THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT\nPOINT. I'M GLAD YOU ASKED THIS.\nEVEN THOUGH WE NOW KNOW SHE HAS PNEUMONIA, WE DON'T KNOW A LOT\nABOUT THE PNEUMONIA. THIS IS A MEDICAL SORT OF STORY,\nOBVIOUSLY, BUT WHAT TYPE OF PNEUMONIA IS IT, WHAT IS IT\nCAUSED BY? WE THINK IT'S A BACTERIA BECAUSE\nSHE'S ON ANTIBIOTICS. IS THERE A VIRAL COMPONENT?\nDID SHE GET A CHEST X-RAY. A WALKING PNEUMONIA IS A\nCOLLOQUIAL TERM FOR A PNEUMONIA THAT'S NOT AS SERIOUS.\nI HEARD FOR THE FIRST TIME HER DOCTOR SAID SHE SHOULD GET\nFIVE DAYS OF REST. THAT'S THE FIRST TIME I HEARD A\nSPECIFIC NUMBER AROUND THAT. THEY WOULD SUGGEST A MORE\nSERIOUS THING, WORRIED ENOUGH TO SAY FIVE DAYS OF REST.\n>> PNEUMONIA IN SOMEONE OVER THE AGE OF 65 IS DIFFERENT THAN\nSOMEONE WHO'S YOUNGER. >> YOU'RE OLDER, MORE VULNERABLE\nTO PNEUMONIA IN THE FIRST PLACE, MORE LIKELY TO GET PNEUMONIA IN\nTHE FIRST PLACE.",

EVENTUALLY AT ONE\nPOINT THESE PROTESTERS WERE LET OUT OF THIS RALLY, DON.\nAS FAR AS WE CAN TELL, THE SUPPORTER NEVER LEFT AND WAS NOT\nARRESTED BY AUTHORITIES. >> INTERESTING.\nALSO AT THAT RALLY, HE TALKED ABOUT THIS NOW INFAMOUS BASKET\nOF DEPLORABLES REMARK, WHAT DID HE SAY?\n>> YEAH, THIS IS THE GIFT BASKET THAT KEEPS ON GIVING AS FAR AS\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS CONCERNED. DONALD TRUMP LATCHED ON TO THAT\nCOMMENT AGAIN. HE ACCUSED HILLARY CLINTON\nOF RUNNING A CAMPAIGN OF HATRED. AT ONE POINT DURING THE RALLY,\nHE INVITED SOME OF HIS SUPPORTERS ON STAGE TO SAY\nTHEY'RE NOT DEPLORABLE. HERE'S MORE OF WHAT DONALD TRUMP\nHAD TO SAY AT THIS RALLY IN ASHVILLE EARLIER TONIGHT.\n>> SHE CALLED THE AMERICANS EVERY NAME IN THE BOOK, RACIST,\nSEXIST XENOPHOBIC, ISLAMO PHOBIC.\nSHE SAID THEY WERE NOT EVEN AMERICAN.\nANYBODY XENOPHOBIC? I DON'T THINK SO.\nI DON'T THINK SO. NEVER IN HISTORY HAS A MAJOR\nPARTY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SO VICIOUSLY DEMONIZED THE AMERICAN\nVOTER. >> AND DON WE SHOULD POINT OUT,\nJUST TO CLARIFY WHAT DONALD TRUMP HAS SAID THERE, HILLARY\nCLINTON NEVER SAID THAT HIS SUPPORTERS WERE NOT EVEN\nAMERICAN AS HE PUT IT, DURING THE RALLY TONIGHT.\nHE JUST SIMPLY TOOK THAT ONE TOO FAR, IN TERMS OF BEING\nXENOPHOBIC, HE'S BEEN ACCUSED OF THAT TIME AGAIN THROUGHOUT THIS\nCAMPAIGN, IF YOU LOOK BACK TO HIS -- THE LAUNCH OF HIS\nCAMPAIGN, WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS BEING\nRAPISTS AND DRUG DEALERS AND CRIMINALS AND SO FORTH.\nTHOSE WERE DEEMED TO BE XENOPHOBIC REMARKS BY A LOT OF\nPEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. >> GOING BACK TO THE\nTRANSPARENCY IN THIS CAMPAIGN. DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN IS\nCALLING FOR TRANSPARENCY. DOES THAT EXTEND TO TAXES DO YOU\nTHINK? >> THEY HAVEN'T BEEN TALKING\nABOUT RELEASING HIS TAXES, IN SO FAR AS I CAN TELL, DONALD TRUMP\nHAS NO INTENTION OF DOING THAT. THE WAY HILLARY CLINTON IS\nTRYING TO SORT OF GET OUT OF THIS MESS SHE'S IN ON A LOT OF\nLEVELS HERE IS THAT SHE'S TRYING TO TURN THIS ISSUE ON ITS HEAD\nAND TALK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S TRANSPARENCY, AS SHE SAID TO\nANDERSON EARLIER THIS EVENING, AND THIS IS TRUE, IT IS A FACT\nTHAT SHE HAS RELEASED MORE OF HER HEALTH RECORDS THAN DONALD\nTRUMP HAS. HE'S RELEASED ONE LETTER FROM\nHIS GASTROENTEROLOGIST AND SAYS HE'S GOING TO HAVE A PHYSICAL\nAND RELEASE THE RESULTS OF THAT. SHE'S SAYING, OKAY, I'VE BEEN\nMORE TRANSPARENT THAN HE HAS, AND I INTEND TO RELEASE MORE\nRECORDS. TAKING IT A STEP FURTHER TO HIS\nTAX RETURNS WHICH HE HAS NOT RELEASED.\nSHE SAID TONIGHT THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS MADE 120 FOREIGN\nDEALS, WHAT IS HE HIDING. AND THAT'S A CLEAR POINT SHE\nWANTS TO MAKE. BECAUSE YOU MIGHT KNOW WHAT\nDEALS HE WAS MAKING IF YOU COULD SEE HIS TAX RETURNS.\nTHIS IS GOING TO BE AN ISSUE CONTINUES.\nSHE DIDN'T HELP HERSELF BY NOT LETTING THE PUBLIC KNOW ABOUT\nHER PNEUMONIA. BUT WHAT SHE IS SAYING IS\nIN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS, THIS IS SMALL POTATOES COMPARED\nTO THE DECISION THAT AMERICANS HAVE TO MAKE ABOUT A PRESIDENT\nBEING TRANSPARENT. >> GLORIA, DOUGLAS, JIM, AND\nDOCTOR, ALWAYS A PLEASURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\n>>> DON'T MISS GLORIA BORGER'S INTERVIEW WEDNESDAY NIGHT 9:00\nP.M. ONLY ON CNN. ALMOST PRESIDENT, THING ANY OF\nDEFEAT.",

AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST SO --\nIT'S SO STRANGE THAT WITH ALL OF THAT INFORMATION OUT THERE, AND\nAS SOON AS IT BECAME CLEAR I COULDN'T POWER THROUGH, WE, YOU\nKNOW, WE SAID WHAT WAS GOING ON. >> YEAH, BUT WHEN YOU --\n>> DONALD TRUMP IS -- >> SORRY.\n>> WHAT? >> WHEN YOU LEFT YOUR DAUGHTER'S\nAPARTMENT, YOU SAID YOU WERE FEELING GREAT.\nOBVIOUSLY YOU -- >> I DID.\nI FELT -- I FELT REALLY GOOD, BUT THAT DIDN'T MEAN THAT I\nSHOULDN'T REST. SO WHEN I -- YOU KNOW, I DID.\nI MEAN, I FELT 100% BETTER. >> DOESN'T YOUR HANDLING OF\nTHIS, AND YOUR CAMPAIGN'S -- YOU KNOW, THEIR REFUSAL TO\nACKNOWLEDGE WHAT HAPPENED UNTIL REALLY AFTER THAT VIDEO WAS\nCIRCULATED, CONFIRMS SUSPICION OF SOME VOTERS THAT YOU'RE NOT\nTRANSPARENT OR TRUSTWORTHY? >> OH, MY GOODNESS, ANDERSON.\nYOU KNOW, COMPARE EVERYTHING YOU KNOW ABOUT ME WITH MY OPPONENT.\nI THINK IT'S TIME HE MET THE SAME LEVEL OF DISCLOSURE THAT I\nHAVE FOR YEARS. YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT A MEDICAL\nREPORT ON ME THAT MEETS THE SAME STANDARD AS MITT ROMNEY AND\nBARACK OBAMA. DONALD TRUMP'S DOCTOR SAID HE'D\nBE THE HEALTHIEST PRESIDENT IN HISTORY.\nTHAT'S JUST NOT EVEN SERIOUS. AND I'VE RELEASED NEARLY 40\nYEARS OF TAX RETURNS. HE HASN'T RELEASED ONE.\nTHIS IS A MAN WITH UNKNOWN NUMBERS OF PARTNERS AND\nINVESTORS WHO SAYS HE'S DOING 120 FOREIGN DEALS.\nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE TO KNOW WHAT HE'S UP TO AND WHAT HE\nIS HIDING. SO IF WE WEREN'T -- IF WE\nWEREN'T FAST ENOUGH, YOU KNOW, I'VE TALKED TO MY STAFF, WE, YOU\nKNOW, TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT.\nBUT THE INFORMATION IS OUT THERE.\nYOU CAN'T SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP.\n>> BRIAN FALLON FROM YOUR CAMPAIGN SAID YOUR CAMPAIGN IS\nGOING TO RELEASE MORE OF YOUR RECORDS.\nAS YOU KNOW PROBABLY, DONALD TRUMP HAS SAID HE'S NOW HAD A\nPHYSICAL I BELIEVE ON FRIDAY AND HE'S GOING TO RELEASE THAT SOON.\nWILL YOU BE RELEASING MORE DETAILS ABOUT YOUR MEDICAL\nHISTORY AND DO YOU KNOW HOW DETAILED IT'S GOING TO BE, HOW\nFAR IT'S GOING TO GO BACK? IS IT GOING TO BE MORE ABOUT\nWHAT HAPPENED IN 2012 WHEN YOU FELL AND HIT YOUR HEAD?\nDO YOU KNOW HOW FAR IT WILL GO? >> WELL, WE'RE GOING TO BE\nRELEASING MORE INFORMATION, AND I THINK IT'S THEIR TO SAY WE'VE\nALREADY MET THE STANDARD OF DISCLOSURE OF PAST PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATES LIKE MITT ROMNEY AND PRESIDENT OBAMA.\nWE'LL ADD MORE INFORMATION, BUT I'VE ALREADY RELEASED\nINFORMATION ABOUT MY HEALTH IN CAMPAIGN, AS WELL AS NEARLY 40\nYEARS OF TAX RETURNS. WE'VE ALREADY MET A HIGH\nSTANDARD OF TRANSPARENCY AND WE KNOW THE LEAST ABOUT DONALD\nTRUMP OF ANY CANDIDATE IN RECENT AMERICAN HISTORY.\nKNOW VIRTUALLY NOTHING ABOUT HIS BUSINESS ENTANGLEMENTS, HIS\nFOREIGN INVESTORS. YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY PAST TIME\nFOR HIM TO BE HELD TO THE SAME STANDARD, NOT JUST AS ME, BUT OF\nEVERYBODY ELSE WHO HAS SOUGHT THIS JOB.\n>> THE FINAL QUESTION, I KNOW BOTH YOUR SUPPORTERS AND\nPROBABLY THOSE WHO ARE OPPOSED TO YOU WANT TO KNOW THE ANSWER\nTO IS, HOW QUICKLY, WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO GET BACK ON THE\nCAMPAIGN TRAIL? >> WELL, IT WILL BE THE NEXT\nCOUPLE OF DAYS. OBVIOUSLY, I WAS SUPPOSED TO\nREST FIVE DAYS. THAT'S WHAT THEY TOLD ME ON\nFRIDAY, AND I DIDN'T FOLLOW THAT VERY WISE ADVICE.\nSO I JUST WANT TO GET THIS OVER AND DONE WITH AND GET BACK ON\nTHE TRAIL AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. >> SECRETARY CLINTON, WE WISH\nYOU THE BEST AND A SPEEDY RECOVERY.\nTHANKS TO YOU SO MUCH FOR SPEAKING WITH US.\n>> THANK YOU. GOOD TO TALK TO YOU, ANDERSON.\nTHANKS A LOT. >> SECRETARY CLINTON IN HER\nFIRST INTERVIEW SINCE THE INCIDENT YESTERDAY.\nA LOT TO TALK ABOUT. WITH ME, FORMER MITT ROMNEY\nCAMPAIGN ADVISER, STUART STEVENS.\nCOREY LEWANDOWSKI. CLINTON SUPPORTER, NATIONAL\nMOVEON.ORG SPOKESPERSON, KARINE JEAN-PIERRE.\nAND GLORIA BORGER. KARINE, DO YOU THINK THIS HAS\nLASTING REPERCUSSIONS FOR SECRETARY CLINTON?\nIT DOES PLAY INTO, YOU KNOW, SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS AND\nNARRATIVE THAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING FROM DONALD TRUMP AND\nTHE DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN. DOES IT HAVE LASTING\nREPERCUSSIONS? >> I THINK IT HAS A -- IT'S A\nDISTRACTION, RIGHT, BUT NO LASTING EFFECT.\nLOOK, SHE HAS A COMMON ILLNESS THAT 5 MILLION TO 10 MILLION\nAMERICANS GET EVERY DAY, RIGHT, AND IN THE SHORT TERM SHE'LL GET\nOVER THIS AND SHE'LL MOVE ON. >> ISN'T IT MORE ABOUT HOW THE\nCAMPAIGN HANDLED IT AND NOT DISSEMINATING THE INFORMATION\nEVEN ON THAT DAY AFTER PEOPLE KNEW SOMETHING WAS GOING ON?\n>> THE CAMPAIGN HAS SAID THEMSELVES, LOOK, THEY COULD\nHAVE HANDLED THIS A LOT BETTER. THEY'RE RIGHT.\nTHEY COULD HAVE DONE THAT. ONE THING I WANTED TO POINT OUT,\nYOU HAD SANJAY GUPTA IN THE 8:00 HOUR.\nHE WAS ABLE TO LIST OUT ALL OF THE MEDICATIONS THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON TAKES AND THE REASON WHY IS BECAUSE SHE ACTUALLY PUT OUT\nA MEDICAL REPORT. ARE WE ABLE TO DO THAT FOR\nTRUMP? NO.\nWE CAN'T. BECAUSE WHAT HE PUT OUT ACTUALLY\nHAS NO SUBSTANCE. SO THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF A\nDOUBLE STANDARD HERE. >> COREY, THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN\nCERTAINLY IS TRYING TO SWITCH THIS TO FOCUS ON DONALD TRUMP,\nAND THE DISPARITIES BETWEEN WHAT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS\nRELEASED AND WHAT, YOU KNOW, THEIR VIEW OF WHAT DONALD TRUMP\nHAS RELEASED. >> LOOK, WHAT THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN DOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT, AT A PRIVATE FUND-RAISER\nON FRIDAY NIGHT, SHE CALLED PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP\nA BASKET OF DEPLORABLES. THAT'S 14 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE\nPRIMARY. >> SHE DID APOLOGIZE, THE FACT\nSHE SAID NOT HALF. >> WHICH MEANS -- IT'S A GROSS\nGENERAL STATION. IF THIS STORY WASN'T DOMINATING\nTHE NEWS COVERAGE RIGHT NOW WHICH IS HER ALMOST PASSING OUT\nAT THE 9/11 MEMORIAL, THAT'S WHAT YOU'D BE TALKING ABOUT\nTODAY. REALLY THAT'S AKIN TO MITT\nROMNEY'S 47% STATEMENT THAT WAS MADE FOUR YEARS AGO AND WHAT IT\nIS IS IT'S A GROSS GENERALIZATION, SOMETHING THAT\nREALLY ISN'T APPROPRIATE SO I THINK AS MUCH AS THE HILLARY\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN DOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE HEALTH ISSUE, I\nTHINK THEY'D RATHER BE TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE THAN THE\nSTATEMENT SHE MADE FRIDAY NIGHT ABOUT THE PEOPLE SUPPORTING THE\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN. >> IT'S NOT THE SAME.\nTHE 40% WAS BASICALLY A NARRATIVE THAT TOLD HOW MITT\nROMNEY WAS RICH AND DISCONNECTED, RIGHT?\nIT WAS ABOUT THE WEALTHY. WHAT SHE TALKED ABOUT,\nDEPLORABLES, WAS ABOUT THE BIGOTRY OF DONALD TRUMP.\nHOW THAT NARRATIVE IS, RELATES TO HIM.\nLOOK, SO, LOOK, LET'S BE CLEAR HERE, THERE IS AN ELEMENT,\nRIGHT, OF DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTERS THAT ARE DEPLORABLE,\nRIGHT? >> THAT'S EGREGIOUS.\nTHEY'RE NOT. YOU KNOW WHAT --\n>> THEY ARE. THEY ARE.\nWHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT GETTING DAVID DUKE SUPPORT --\n>> HE DOESN'T HAVE DAVID DUKE SUPPORT.\nHE DOESN'T WANT DAVID DUKE SUPPORT.\n>> WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE AT HIS RALLIES WHO ARE TALKING ABOUT\nWHITE POWER, WE'VE SEEN THIS FOOTAGE SAYING, YELLING WHITE\nPOWER. WHEN YOU HAVE CONFEDERATE\nFLAG -- >> YOU HAVE AT A HILLARY CLINTON\nRALLY DIRECTLY BEHIND HER THE FATHER OF THE LARGEST MASS\nMURDERER IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA'S HISTORY.\n>> THAT WAS ONE -- >> SHE ACCOUNTABLE FOR HIM?\n>> LET ME BRING IN STUART AND GLORIA.\nSTUART, I MEAN, CLEARLY THIS HAS TAKEN THE ATTENTION AWAY FROM\nWHAT HILLARY CLINTON SAID ON FRIDAY ABOUT HALF THE TRUMP\nSUPPORTERS BEING THIS BASKET OF DEPLORABLES.\n>> WELL, IT'S AN ELOQUENT THEORY THAT SHE GOT SICK TO TAKE THE --\n>> OF COURSE NOT. IT WASN'T INTENTIONAL, BUT --\n>> I -- I -- YOU KNOW, LISTEN, CAMPAIGNS USUALLY AREN'T\nAFFECTED BY THESE STORIES ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.\nWE TALK ABOUT THE 47% STORY. IT WAS A BIG STORY.\nTHERE'S REALLY NO EVIDENCE WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT, IF IT HADN'T\nHAPPENED THAT MITT ROMNEY WOULD HAVE WON.\nYOU KNOW, WHEN YOU GET IN THESE CAMPAIGNS, YOU HAVE TO REALLY\nTREAT IT THE SAME WAY NFL QUARTERBACKS TREAT THROWING\nINTERCEPTIONS. YOU THROW INTERCEPTIONS.\nYOU JUST PLAY THE NEXT PLAY. NO CAMPAIGN DOESN'T MAKE\nMISTAKES. IT'S A MATTER OF PUSHING THROUGH\nAND BEING ABLE TO TRY TO COMMUNICATE WITH AS MANY VOTERS\nAS YOU CAN WHY YOU THINK YOU SHOULD BE PRESIDENT.\nI DON'T THINK THESE LITTLE THINGS ARE GOING TO MAKE THAT\nMUCH DIFFERENCE. >> GLORIA, TO STUART'S POINT,\nWE'RE FOCUSED ON THE MINUTIA OF WHAT'S HAPPENING EVERY SECOND.\n>> RIGHT. >> I HAVE NO LIFE, THIS IS WHAT\nI DO. I'M NOT GOING TO SPEAK TO\nEVERYBODY ELSE ON THE PANEL. >> YOU CAN.\n>> YOU SEEM TO HAVE MORE LIVES THAN I DO.\nMOST PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY HAVE REAL JOBS UNLIKE ME AND ARE OUT\nTHERE WORKING HARD AND HAVE KIDS AND A MILLION THINGS THEY GOT TO\nTAKE CARE OF AND ARE NOT FOLLOWING THE MINUTIA LIKE I AM\nAND MANY OF US ARE. I GUESS TO STUART'S POINT, DOES\nTHIS REALLY MATTER? >> I THINK WHAT IT DOES IS IT\nAFFIRMS HOW YOU FEEL OR DON'T FEEL ABOUT SOMEBODY.\nI DON'T THINK HILLARY CLINTON'S BOUT WITH PNEUMONIA IN AND OF\nITSELF IS GOING TO CHANGE ONE VOTE AT ALL.\nBUT I DO BELIEVE THAT IF YOU BELIEVE SHE HAS A PENCHANT FOR\nSECRECY AND WANTS TO KEEP THINGS FROM THE AMERICAN PUBLIC AND\nHIDES THINGS AND IS DEVIOUS, YOU WILL SAY THIS IS PART OF THAT\nWHOLE NARRATIVE. AND, YOU KNOW, THE MOST\nINTERESTING THING TO ME ABOUT ALL OF THIS IS THAT WE DON'T\nHAVE DONALD TRUMP OUT THERE TALKING ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S\nHEALTH WHICH HE'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN.\nINSTEAD, WHEN THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT SHE HAD A HEALTH ISSUE, THE\nPNEUMONIA, AND THAT THE PRESS WAS KEPT AWAY FROM KNOWING ABOUT\nIT, WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT? HE'S TALKING ABOUT WHAT WORKS\nFOR HIM WHICH IS WHAT COREY WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT.\nAND WHICH IS THE BASKET OF DEPLORABLES BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT\nWILL MOTIVATE HIS BASE TO GET OUT AND VOTE.\nSO, YOU KNOW, AT THIS POINT -- >> WELL, ALSO IT'S THE AGE-OLD,\nYOU KNOW, POLITICAL IDEA OF WHEN THE OTHER CAMPAIGN IS STUMBLING,\nYOU JUST STEP OUT OF THE WAY. ALLOW THEM TO KIND OF, YOU KNOW,\nCONTINUE TO STUMBLE. YOU DON'T NEED TO ADD TO IT\nBECAUSE, IN FACT, YOU COULD, YOU KNOW, STOP THE STUMBLE.\nWE GOT TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK. >> RIGHT.\n>> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE WITH THE PANEL AHEAD.\nDONALD TRUMP WRAPPED UP A RALLY IN NORTH CAROLINA EARLIER\nTONIGHT. AS WE MENTIONED, HE WAS SLAMMING\nCLINTON ON HER COMMENT ABOUT SOME OF HIS SUPPORTERS.\nWHAT HE SAID TONIGHT, AHEAD.",

NO PATERNITY LEAVE, JUST\nMATERNITY LEAVE, BUT AN EXPANDED SUBSIDY TO HELP OFFSET CHILD\nCARE. LISTEN TO THAT.\n>> THE FIRST PART OF MY CHILD CARE PLAN ALLOWS FOR EVERY\nPARENT OR FAMILY IN AMERICA, INCLUDING ADOPTIVE PARENTS AND\nFOSTER PARENT/GUARDIANS TO DEDUCT THEIR CHILD CARE EXPENSES\nFROM THEIR INCOME TAXES. I SEE THE WOMEN WHO I JUST MET\nIN THE FRONT ROW ARE VERY HAPPY ABOUT THAT.\nTHEY WILL FULLY BE ABLE TO DEDUCT THE AVERAGE COST OF CHILD\nCARE FOR THEIR STATE, FROM BIRTH THROUGH THE AGE OF 13.\n>> AND, SARAH, CERTAINLY NO ACCIDENT THAT THE SPEECH WAS IN\nPENNSYLVANIA. >> Reporter: OH, ABSOLUTELY NO\nACCIDENT. PENNSYLVANIA IS A KEY STATE FOR\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. THEY REALLY SEE THE RUST BELT AS\nTHEIR STRATEGY TO VICTORY. THEY HAVE NOT BEEN AS\nCOMPETITIVE IN SOME OF THE STATES THE OUT WEST THAT WE'VE\nSEEN REPUBLICANS MAKE A PLAY FOR IN THE PAST.\nSO TO BE HERE IN A SUBURB OF PHILADELPHIA, SPEAKING TO FEMALE\nVOTERS, SPEAKING TO SUBURBAN VOTERS, THESE ARE THE KINDS OF\nPEOPLE TRUMP NEEDS TO WIN OVER IN A STATE LIKE PENNSYLVANIA, IF\nHE WANTS THIS MAP TO WORK IN NOVEMBER.\n>> SARA MURRAY, THANKS VERY MUCH.\nHILLARY CLINTON SET TO BE BACK ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL THURSDAY\nAFTER TAKING A COUPLE OF DAYS TO RECOVER FROM PNEUMONIA.\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN ITSELF DID NOT TAKE A SICK DAY, AS P\nPRESIDENT OBAMA HIT THE TRAIL FOR HER.\nBRIANNA KEILAR REPORTS. >> Reporter: HILLARY CLINTON\nRESTING AT HOME WITH PNEUMONIA, GETTING AN ASSIST FROM PRESIDENT\nOBAMA IN PHILADELPHIA, WHERE HE BLASTED DONALD TRUMP FOR NOT\nBEING TRANSPARENT. >> YOU HAVE ONE CANDIDATE IN\nTHIS RACE WHO'S RELEASED DECADES WORTH OF HER TAX RETURNS.\nTHE OTHER CANDIDATE IS THE FIRST IN DECADES WHO REFUSES TO\nRELEASE ANY AT ALL. >> Reporter: HE ALSO DEFENDED\nTHE CLINTON FOUNDATION AND CRITICIZED TRUMP'S.\n>> ONE CANDIDATE'S FAMILY FOUNDATION HAS SAVED COUNTLESS\nLIVES AROUND THE WORLD.

TOM FOREMAN NOW JOINS US.\n>> THE QUESTION OF PARENTAL LEAVE HAS BEEN A DEMOCRATIC\nTALKING POINT FOR QUITE SOME TIME, BUT TRUMP HAS SIGNALLED IN\nA BIG WAY THAT HE'S PUTTING IT ON THE REPUBLICAN PLATFORM, TOO.\nLET'S LOOK AT HOW HILLARY CLINTON'S PLAN AND HIS PLAN\nCOMPARE. AMONG THE MAIN POINTS, CLINTON\nWANTS TO GIVE NEW PARENTS 12 WEEKS OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE OR\nMEDICAL LEAVE, WHICH SHE SAYS WON'T COST BUSINESSES ANYTHING,\nBECAUSE SHE'LL PAY FOR IT BY INCREASING TAXES ON THE WEALTHY.\nTRUMP'S PLANS CALL FOR SIX WEEKS OF MATERNITY LEAVE.\nTHIS IS STRICTLY FOR MOTHERS AT THIS POINT, NOT FATHERS.\nIF COMPANIES DON'T ALREADY OFFER MATERNITY LEAVE, THEY'LL HAVE TO\nPAY MORE FEDERAL INSURANCE PROGRAM.\nWHAT ABOUT CHILD CARE? CLINTON WANTS NO MORE THAN 10%\nOF A FAMILY'S INCOME TO GO FOR FAMILY CARE.\nAND SHE WANTS TO GIVE TAX BREAKS OR GOVERNMENT GRANTS TO FAMILIES\nWHERE THE EXPENSES GO BEYOND THAT MARK.\nTRUMP WANTS TO FOCUS MORE EXCLUSIVELY ON THE TAX BREAK\nSIDE, SUGGESTING CHILD CARE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS, SIMILAR TO\nYOUR HEALTH CARE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS, CAN HELP PREMIUM\nREDUCE THEIR BILLS. CLINTON WANTS FREE QUALITY PRE-K\nFOR ALL 4-YEAR-OLDS. THAT'S JUST PART OF A BROAD\nSERIES OF PROPOSALS SHE HAS FOR IMPROVING PUBLIC EDUCATION.\nTRUMP WANTS TO SUBSTANTIALLY REWORK SOME TAX DEDUCTIONS TO\nGIVE PARENTS MORE MONEY IN THE POCKET FOR ALL OF THEIR CHILD\nCARE ISSUES, INCLUDING EDUCATIONAL CHOICES.\nANDERSON? >> I MEAN, THESE ARE ALL\nCERTAINLY POPULAR IDEAS FOR MANY WORKING FAMILIES, WHO COULD\nCERTAINLY USE THE HELP. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS?\n>> WELL, THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN SAYS THAT FOR TRUMP, THE PROBLEM\nIS FUNDAMENTALLY THAT HIS PLAN WAS FOR THE RICH.\nTHAT TAX BREAKS WON'T DO MUCH FOR THE MIDDLE OR LOW-INCOME\nFAMILIES. THE TRUMP PEOPLE SAY SHE'S DEAD\nWRONG. AND ANALYSTS IN THE MIDDLE SAY\nTHE REAL ISSUE IS FUNDING. HOW IS ANYONE REALLY GOING TO I\nPA FOR EITHER ONE OF THESE PLANS OR CAN THE PLANS PAY FOR\nTHEMSELVES? THE PROGRESSIVE THINK TANK, THE\nCENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS, ESTIMATE THAT FOR FAMILIES\nLIVING BELOW THE POVERTY LINE, THEY SPEND ALMOST A THIRD OF\nTHEIR INCOME ON CHILD CARE, AND EVERYONE ELSE PAYS A LOT, TOO.\nSO OFFSETTING THAT IN A MEANINGFUL WAY WOULD MEAN\nSHIFTING MONUMENTAL AMOUNTS OF MONEY FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER\nAND IT'S NOT CLEAR EITHER OF THESE NOMINEES COULD PULL THAT\nOFF AS A PRESIDENT. ANDERSON?\n>> TOM FOREMAN, THANKS. BACK WITH THE PANEL.\nRICHARD SOCARIDES, BAKARI SELLERS, GLORIA BORGER, KELLY\nMcENANY, AND JACK KINGSTON. IT IS UNORTHODOX TO HEAR\nREPUBLICANS MAKING PROPOSALS LIKE THIS.\nSO, YOU KNOW, DONALD TRUMP IS CERTAINLY DOING SOMETHING WE\nDON'T HEAR VERY OFTEN. >> WE DON'T HEAR REPUBLICANS\nVERY OFTEN TALKING ABOUT GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS TO\nPROBLEMS, SOCIAL SAFETY NET, ENTITLEMENTS.\nAND THAT'S WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS TALKING ABOUT NOW.\nI THINK THAT THE BIG QUESTION MARK HAS ALWAYS BEEN WITH\nREPUBLICANS, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO PAY FOR THINGS.\nBECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO ADD TO THE DEFICIT.\nAND AS TOM FOREMAN JUST SAID, WE DENT KNOW.\nWE DON'T KNOW HOW YOU'RE GOING TO PAY FOR THINGS.\nHE CAN SAY HE'S GOING TO PAY FOR IT ONE WAY --\n>> I WOULD SAY THESE PROPOSALS FROM DONALD TRUMP TONIGHT SOUND\nPOSITIVELY EUROPEAN. THEY SOUND A LITTLE LIKE\nEUROPEAN SOCIALISM. IT'S LIKE, HOW FAR WILL HE GO TO\nSOFTEN HIS IMAGE. THIS IS ABOUT SOFTENING HIS\nIMAGE. BUT YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER, THIS\nIS -- WE'RE EIGHT WEEKS FROM TONIGHT THE ELECTION WILL BE\nOVER AND WE WILL KNOW WHO IS OUR NEXT PRESIDENT.\nAND WHAT ELECTIONS ARE ABOUT IS LIKE, WHAT DO YOU STAND FOR?\nI MEAN, TRUMP CAN'T COME UP WITH A PROPOSAL EIGHT WEEKS BEFORE\nTHE ELECTION AND SAY, FOR THE FIRST TIME, THAT HE'S FOR CHILD\nCARE. >> -- A MEMBER OF THE U.S.\nSENATE. I NEVER KNEW HER TO BE A CHILD\nCARE CHAMPION. I WAS IN THE HOUSE WHEN SHE\nWAS -- >> OH, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.\n>> I NEVER -- >> THAT'S RIDICULOUS.\nFAMILIES IS WHAT SHE'S BEEN ABOUT FROM THE BEGINNING?\n>> THE REALITY IS, I DO KNOW SHE WAS FOR NAFTA.\nHER PHUSBAND PASSED IT.

THAT'S JUST FUNDAMENTALLY NOT\nTRUE, CONGRESSMAN. AND WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THE\nREASON THAT WE HAVE THE C.H.I.P. PROGRAM, WHICH IS THE CHILD\nHEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM -- >> ABSOLUTELY NOT!\nTHAT IS NOT TRUE. >> THAT IS SO TRUE.\nTHAT IS SO -- >> GUYS, NOBODY LISTENS WHEN YOU\nTALK OVER EACH OTHER. >> THAT IS SO TRUE.\n>> BAKARI, SAY YOUR PIECE. >> I WANT TO GET BACK TO THE\nPOINT. I DON'T WANT TO LOSE THE FACT\nTHAT THIS HAS BEEN A TENANT OF THE DEMOCRATIC TEA PARTY FOR A\nLONG PERIOD OF TIME. THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS TRIED\nTO PUSH THROUGH PAID FAMILY LEAVE FOR A VERY LONG TIME.\nAND IT'S THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THAT REFUSE TO PASS FAMILY PAY\nLEAVE. SO IT'S NUANCED, IT'S GOOD TO\nSEE DONALD TRUMP TALKING ABOUT IT --\n>> OKAY, RESPOND. >> LET ME SAY THIS ABOUT\nC.H.I.P.s, THE CHILD HEALTH CARE PROGRAM.\nHILLARY CLINTON, TO MY RECOLLECTION, HAD ABSOLUTELY\nNOTHING TO DO WITH IT. IT CAME OUT OF THE HOUSE\nREPUBLICAN EDUCATION COMMITTEE, LED BY BILL GOODLAND, AND WE ON\nTHE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE FUNDED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME.\n>> BUT IT CAME OUT OF HEALTH REFORM.\n>> IT CAME OUT OF -- WELL, THEN, EVERYTHING WE'RE GOING TO SAY\nTHAT COMES OUT OF HEALTH REFORM ORIGINATED FROM HILLARY.\n>> NO, NO, IT CAME OUT OF HER HEALTH REFORM --\n>> IT DID NOT. >> IT DID!\n>> IN FACT, MOST STATES HAD SOME LEVEL OF IT.\nAND IT WAS PART OF MEDICAID. C.H.I.P.s WAS SIMPLY AN\nEXPANSION OF MEDICAID FOR CHILDREN AGE 12.\n>> BUT IF YOU'RE A VOTER WHO CARES ABOUT CHILD CARE, AND\nYOU'VE BEEN PAYING ANY ATTENTION FOR THE LAST 30 YEARS IN\nAMERICAN POLITICS, YOU ARE GOING TO SUPPORT HILLARY CLINTON, NOT\nDONALD TRUMP. >> UNLESS --\n>> THIS IS JUST AN EFFORT TO SOFTEN HIS IMAGE.\n>> PLEASE -- >> THERE MIGHT BE OTHER REASONS.\n>> OKAY. NO ONE LISTENS WHEN EVERYONE\nTALKS. IT'S MY PET PEEVE.\nI KNOW VIEWERS AT HOME JUST FREAK OUT.\nSO, PLEASE, LET'S JUST NOT TALK OVER'VE OTHER.\nKAYLEIGH, YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN. >> I WAS GOING TO SAY, DEMOCRATS\nHAVE MADE PROMISES, YOU'RE RIGHT, ABOUT CHILD CARE, THAT\nHAVE NOT MATERIALIZED OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES.\nAND THIS IS WHEN DONALD TRUMP SAYS, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE?\nTRYING SOMETHING ELSE? TRUSTING ME ON THESE ISSUES?\nYOU'VE TRUSTED DEMOCRATS FOR 40 YEARS.\nAND IT HASN'T WORKED. DONALD TRUMP IS PUTTING FORTH A\nPLAN. HE IS PUTTING FORTH A WAY TO PAY\nFOR IT. AND HILLARY CLINTON'S PROMISING\nTO DO DOUBLE, BUT SHE DOESN'T HAVE A PLAN TO PAY FOR IT.\nSHE SAYS, I'LL TAX THE REACH, THAT'S WHAT OBAMA HAS SAID.\nBUT HE HAS SAID, DOUBLE THE NATIONAL DEBT FROM $10 TRILLION\nTO $19 TRILLION. >> BUT CAN DONALD TRUMP COME\nFORWARD WITH A PLAN SO CLOSE TO ELECTION DAY WHEN IT'S NOT\nREALLY A SUBJECT HE'S EVER REALLY SPOKEN ABOUT BEFORE --\n>> WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT IVANKA DID AT THE CONVENTION.\nSHE SET THIS THING UP. SHE SAID, IT WOULD BE COMING.\nSO THIS ISN'T JUST -- >> BUT IS IT WEIRD THAT IT CAME\nFROM HIS DAUGHTER? THAT BASICALLY, HIS DAUGHTER HAS\nACCESS TO HIM, AND THEREFORE GOT HIM TO DO THIS?\nMAYBE IT'S A GOOD THING. >> I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE,\nBECAUSE SHE IS A LEADER IN SOME OF HIS CORPORATIONS AND SOME OF\nHIS BUSINESS LEADERS AND SHE'S SAYING, DAD, THIS IS SOMETHING\nWE NEED TO DO, AND HE'S LISTENING.\nI THINK WE'RE HEARING THE DEMOCRATS GET A LITTLE WORRIED\nHE'S KNOCKING AT THE DOOR OF SOME OF THEIR ISSUES.\n>> I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT DONALD TRUMP IS CLEARLY NEWER TO\nTHIS ISSUE THAN HILLARY CLINTON, WHO'S BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR\nDECADES. THAT'S NOT A PARTISAN THING,\nIT'S JUST THE TRUTH. AND RECENTLY, DONALD TRUMP\nBRAGGED THAT HE'S GOT GREAT ON-SITE CHILD CARE FOR HIS\nEMPLOYEES. AND BOTH THE AP AND THE DAILY\nBEAST DID STORIES SAYING THAT THE -- THAT THE DAY CARE IS\nACTUALLY FOR THE GUESTS AT HIS -- THE CHILDREN OF THE\nGUESTS AT HIS HOTELS, AND NOT HIS OWN EMPLOYEES.\nAND, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE PURSUING THAT STORY, BECAUSE THE QUESTION\nIS, HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN DEVOTED TO THESE ISSUES?\nWHAT HE IS DOING, I WILL GIVE YOU, IS FURTHER THAN LOTS OF\nPEOPLE IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAVE GONE, LARGELY BECAUSE IT\nDOESN'T FIT IN WITH THE REPUBLICAN ORTHODOXY, AND\nLARGELY BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO COST AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY.\nBUT THE NOTION OF SORT OF, WHO'S BEEN DEVOTED TO, YOU KNOW,\nWOMEN'S ISSUES, AS IN MATERNITY LAVE, OR CHILD CARE ISSUES,\nWHEN HILLARY CLINTON HAS SPENT 30 YEARS.\n>> AND WE JUST DOUBLE CHECKED. POLITIFACT HAS SAID IT'S MOSTLY\nTRUE, HILLARY CLINTON'S CLAIM ABOUT BEING BEHIND THE C.H.I.P.s\nPROGRAM. YOU CAN QUIBBLE WITH THAT OR\nNOT. >> THERE WAS A LINE --\n>> I DON'T THINK THE QUESTION IS --\n>> KAYLEIGH? >> I DON'T THINK THE QUESTION IS\nWHO'S DEVOTED TO WOMEN MORE. I KNOW DONALD TRUMP'S UPLIFTED\nWOMEN IN HIS COMPANY, HAS RAISED A VERY WONDERFUL DAUGHTER, WHO\nHAS THE CAPACITY TO ACHIEVE AND HAS ACHIEVED.\nI DON'T THINK THE QUESTION IS DEVOTION.\nI THINK THE QUESTION IS ABILITY TO ACTUAL GET THINGS DONE.\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS NOT GOTTEN THIS DONE, DESPITE BEING SO\nDEVOTED TO IT, FOR DECADES. IT DIDN'T GET DONE UNDER BILL\nCLINTON'S ADMINISTRATION. DONALD TRUMP HAS THE CAPACITY TO\nCHANGE, BECAUSE HE'S NOT A POLITICIAN, HE'S A BUSINESSMAN.\nSO TRY SOMEONE ELSE. DON'T TRY A POLITICIAN WHO TALKS\nOUT OF ONE OF HER MOUTH. >> WHAT ABOUT THE DEPLORABLES\nCOMMENT. AT THIS POINT -- PROBABLY NOT\nSOMETHING THE CLINTON PEOPLE WANT.\nBUT THEY'RE RUNNING COMMERCIALS. THEY'RE NOT RUNNING AWAY FROM\nTHIS. SHE'S ALREADY SAID, I SHOULDN'T\nHAVE SAID HALF, THAT WAS INCORRECT, BUT THEY'RE STICKING\nBY IT. HOW BIG OF A MISTAKE DO YOU\nTHINK THIS WAS FOR HILLARY CLINTON?\n>> I DON'T IT WAS. >> I AGREE WITH HIM.\nI THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, SHE PROBABLY REGRETS SAYING IT AND\nSHE'S SAID AS MUCH, BECAUSE IT DISTRACTS FROM ATTENTION.\nBUT THE TRUTH IS, IS THAT TRUMP HAS ATTRACTED -- MR. TRUMP HAS\nATTRACTED A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH VERY FRINGY BELIEFS TO HIS\nCAMPAIGN. AND HE'S RUN A CAMPAIGN BASED\nUPON ANGER AND FEAR AND PREJUDICE, AND I THINK WE HAVE\nTO CALL HIM OUT ON THAT. >> I THINK THIS IS A PLAYING\nFIELD WHERE HILLARY CLINTON WOULD DO EXTREMELY WELL.\nTHE REASON I BELIEVE THAT IS BECAUSE PEOPLE TRY TO COMPARE\nTHIS TO MITT ROMNEY'S 47% REMARK.\nAND THE REASON THIS IS DIFFERENT IS BECAUSE MITT ROMNEY WAS\nSHOWING AN ANIMUS TOWARDS POOR PEOPLE.\nHILLARY CLINTON IS SHOWING AN ANIMUS TOWARDS RACISTS AND\nBIGOTS.

WE HAVE NUCLEAR CAPABILITY.\n>> WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO BOMB THEM.\n>> WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO TELL HIM ABOUT THINGS LIKE THAT?\nDOES HE NEED TO CUT IT OUT? >> WELL IF THE IRANIANS LET'S\nSAY FOLLOWED THROUGH WITH SOME OF THE THINGS THEY HAVE BEEN\nTHREATENING AND SHOOT DOWN ONE OF OUR AIRCRAFT, I THINK ONE\nTHING OUGHT TO BE VERY SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED IS DOING WHAT WE DID\nNOT DO IN 1983 WHEN THEY BLEW UP OUR MARINE BARRACKS.\nWE THOUGHT ABOUT DOING SOMETHING AND THEN PRESIDENT REAGAN LET\nSECRETARY WEINBERGER DECIDE AND HE DECIDED NOT DO ANYTHING IN\nRETALIATION. AND WE'VE BEEN PAYING FOR THAT\nFOR TWO DECADES BECAUSE WE LOOKED WEAK.\nAND THAT IS WHAT MATTERS IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD PARTICULARLY.\nSO I THINK THE ANSWER IS IF THEY COME AFTER ONE OF OUR AIRCRAFT,\nWE OUGHT TO BE PREPARED. AND I DO NOT EXPECT PRESIDENT\nOBAMA TO DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT. BUT WE OUGHT TO BE PREPARED TO\nBLAST SOME MAJOR, IMPORTANT INSTALLATION OF THEIRS.\nAND THEN WE CAN SMILE AGAIN. BUT I THINK YOU -- YOU CAN'T\nJUST GO ON WHAT SOMEBODY SAYS IN A CIRCUMSTANCE LIKE THIS.\nYOU HAVE TO BUILD UP A REPUTATION FOR BEING EFFECTIVE\nAND FORCEFUL. AND IF THEY SHOOT DOWN ONE OF\nOUR AIRCRAFT I THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA OUGHT TO GO RIGHT BACK AT\nTHEM. I DON'T THINK HE EVER WILL.\nI THINK IT IS COMPLETELY OUTSIDE OF HIS NATURE.\n>> AMBASSADOR WOOLSY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TONIGHT.EY THANK\nFOR YOUR TIME TONIGHT. IVANKA AND DONALD TRUMP GOING TO\nBE SPEAKING TONIGHT. FIRST TIME SINCE THE ACTUAL\nREPUBLICAN CONVENTION. A MAJOR NIGHT TONIGHT.\nAND MORE.                        Hi, John. >>> AS I'VE TRAVELED 5R7D THE\nCOUNTRY WITH MY FATHER, STORIES ABOUT THE HARDSHIPS CAUSED BY\nEXISTING HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. TOO EXPENSIVE.\n>> TOO OUTSIDE DATED AND TOO UNACCESSIBLE COME UP TIME AND\nTIME AGAIN. JUST LAST WEEK I SPOKE WITH A\nMILITARY SPOUSE WHO RECOUNTED THE VICIOUS CYCLE RESPONSIBLE\nFOR HOLDING SO MANY AMERICAN FAMILIES BACK ECONOMICALLY.\nSHE RELAYED THE FRUSTRATION I'VE HEARD ALL TOO OFTEN OF NOT BEING\nABLE TO WORK AND BRING HOME A SECOND INCOME BECAUSE SHE CAN'T\nAFFORD QUALITY AND RELIABLE CHILD CARE.\nSTORIES LIKE THESE GO STRAIGHT TO MY HEART.\nAND THEY HAVE STEELED MY BELIEF THAT THERE HAS TO BE A BERTS\nWAY. I HAVE THREE YOUNG CHILDREN\nMYSELF AND I'M GRATEFUL DAILY FOR THE MEANS TO PURSUE TWO OF\nMY DREAMS, BEING A MOTHER AND INVESTING IN A CAREER THAT\nFULFILLS ME. I RECOGNIZE THAT FAR TOO FEW\nWOMEN CAN SAY THE SAME FOR THEMSELVES AND THAT I AM MORE\nFORTUNATE THAN MOST. THIS MUST CHANGE.\nAS A SOCIETY, WE NEED TO CREATE POLICIES THAT CHAMPION ALL\nPARENTS, ENABLING THE AMERICAN FAMILY TO THRIVE.\nMY DAD GREASE. AND\n -- AGREES AND HE'S IN A VERY UNIQUE POSITION TO DO SOMETHING\nABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND MILLIONS OF OTHER PROBLEMS FACING PARENTS\nAND CARE GIVERS ACROSS OUR COUNTRY.\nTODAY CHILD CARE IS A SINGLE GREATEST EXPENSE FOR MANY\nAMERICAN FAMILIES, EVEN EXCEEDING THE COST OF HOUSING IN\nMUCH OF THE COUNTRY. IT IS COMPLETING THE HARD-EARNED\nSAVINGS OF MEN AND WOMEN ACROSS OUR NATION AND AT THE ROOT OF\nWAGE INEQUALITY BY DISPROPORTIONATELY EFFECTING\nWOMEN. THE FEDERAL POLICIES THAT ARE IN\nPLACE TO BENEFIT FAMILIES WERE WRITTEN MORE THAN 65 YEARS AGO\nTO SERVE A PRIMARILY MALE WORKFORCE THAT NO LONGER EXISTS.\nDUAL INCOME FAMILIES WERE NOT THE NORM IN 1949 WHEN THE\nCURRENT TAX CODES REGARDING FAMILIES WERE ESTABLISHED.\nTODAY HOWEVER WOMEN REPRESENT 47% OF THE U.S. LABOR FORCE AND\nIN ALMOST 2/3 OF MARRIED COUPLES BOTH SPOUSES WORK OUTSIDE OF THE\nHOME. 70% OF MOTHERS WITH CHILDREN AT\nHOME ALSO WORK IN A PROFESSIONAL CAPACITY AND 64% OF THESE MOMS\nHAVE KIDS AGE SIX AND UNDER. THE NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLDS LED MY\nSINGLE MOTHERS HAD DOUBLED IN THE LAST 30 YEARS AND\nAPPROXIMATELY TWO-THIRDS OF THESE WOMEN WORK IN LOW WAGE\nJOBS THAT OFFER NEITHER FLEXIBILITY NOR BENEFITS.\nMY FATHER HAS CREATED A PLAN THAT IS DESIGNED TO BRING RELIEF\nAND TO PROVIDE WORKING PARENTS WITH OPTIONS SO THAT THEY CAN\nMAKE THE DECISIONS THAT ARE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THEIR\nFAMILIES. SAFE, AFFORDABLE HIGH QUALITY\nCHILD CARE SHOULD NOT BE THE LUXURY OF A FORTUNATE FEW.\nHISTORICALLY THIS IS NOT BEEN AN AREA THAT HAS RECEIVED NEARLY AS\nMUCH ATTENTION IN THE POLICY WORLD AS IT DESERVES.\nWHILE THERE ARE SYSTEMS IN PLACE FOR OLDER CHILDREN, HARDLY ANY\nINTELLECTUAL ENERGY HAS BEEN DEVOTED TO ADDRESSING THE NEEDS\nOF FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN FROM BIRTH TO FOUR YEARS OLD.\nIN PARTICULAR LITTLE FOCUS HAS BEEN PUT ON DETERMINING HOW BEST\nTO ALLEVIATE THE ENORMOUS FINANCIAL BURDENS CHILD CARE\nPLACES ON LOW INCOME AND MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES.\nAT THE SAME TIME, THE UNITED STATES IS THE ONLY\nINDUSTRIALIZED NATION IN THE WORLD THAT DOES NOT PROVIDE NEW\nMOTHERS WITH PAID MATERNITY LEAVE.\nMY FATHER'S POLICY WILL GIVE PAID LEAVE THE MOTHERS WHOSE\nEMPLOYERS ARE AMONG THE ALMOST 90% OF U.S. BUSINESSES THAT\nCURRENTLY DO NOT OFFER THIS BENEFIT.\nTHAT IS REFORM THAT IS OF CRITICAL VALUE AND LONG OVERDUE.\nMY FATHER'S PLAN ALSO RECOGNIZE AND SUPPORTS THE MANY WOMEN WHO\nMAY NOT BE MOTHERS BUT WHO HAVE",

I KNOW YOU SAID YOU HELPED\nCONCEPTUALIZE THE IDEA. THE BIG PUSHBACK FROM THE\nCONSERVE STIFS IS WHO IS GOING TO PAY FOR IT.\nWHAT'S THE ANSWER FOR THAT IN. >> WE'VE HAD A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT\nOF SUPPORT ACTUALLY SITTING IN THE AUDIENCE TODAY, FIVE\nCONGRESS WOMEN, AND THE FEEDBACK HAS BEEN AMAZING.\nTHIS IS AN ENORMOUS PROBLEM, THE COST OF CHILDCARE AND CARING FOR\nTHE ELDERLY IS A MASSIVE ISSUE. AND IN THIS COUNTRY.\nAND IT KEEPS ON BEING EXASPERATED AND IN FACT IT'S ONE\nOF THE MAIN REASONS FOR THE INCOME DISPARITY BETWEEN MEN AND\nWOMAN AS IT DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS WOMEN.\nNOW THE COST OF CHILDCARE IS A SINGLE LARGEST EXPENSE AFFECTING\nAMERICAN FAMILIES IN MUCH OF THIS COUNTRY, EVEN EXCEEDING\nHOUSING. SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE.\nPEOPLE RECOGNIZE THIS IS A MASSIVE ISSUE.\nTHAT THE TAX CODES WERE WRITTEN IN A TIME WHEN WOMEN WEREN'T\nAPART OF THE WORKFORCE. NOW WOMEN REPRESENT 47% OF THE\nU.S. LABOR FORCE. SO THERE HAS TO BE REFORMS.\nAND IN TERMS OF PAYING FOR IT, OBVIOUSLY MY FATHER IS ALWAYS\nFISCALLY RESPONSIBLE. HE'S GOING TO BE LAYING OUT HIS\nPLAN ON THURSDAY AND THIS WILL BE BAKED INTO THAT FOR\nCOMPREHENSIVE TACK REFORM. SO IT WAS DEFINITELY ACCOUNTED\nFOR, IT WILL BE PAID FOR. AND IT'S BUDGET NEUTRAL.\n>> NOW MAYBE WE'RE GOING TO GET MORE DETAILS.\nBUT WHAT THEY'RE SAYING SO FAR IS HE'S GOING TO PAY FOR THE IT\nBASED ON THE UNEMPLOYMENT NRCHS THAT ALL EMPLOYERS HAVE TO PAY.\n>> THAT'S ONLY ONE COMPONENT. >> RAISE THE TAXES THAT\nEMPLOYERS HAVE TO PAY ON EMPLOYEES.\nSO CONSERVATIVES ARE SAYING THERE WILL BE -- THEY WON'T HIRE\nAS MANY PEOPLE IF THEY HAVE TO PAY MORE PER EMPLOYEE.\n>> IT WON'T RAISE THE TAXES. THAT'S ONE COMPONENT OF IT WHICH\nIS SIX WEEKS PAID LEAVE. AND THE UNITED STATES IS THE\nONLY DEVELOPED COUNTRY IN THE WORLD THAT DOESN'T OFFER PAID\nMATERNITY LEAVE. WE HAVE TO CATCH UP WITH THE\nTIMES. BUT WE'RE GOING TO COVER IT\nTHROUGH EXISTING UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.\nAND THERE'S TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF FRAUD, WASTE AND ABUSE AS\nPART OF THAT PROGRAM, BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.\nSO IT WILL BE TOTALLY PAID FOR IN AND OF ITSELF.\nTHAT'S THE ONLY COMPONENT -- SORRY GO AHEAD.\n>> DO YOU THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, YOUR DAD CAUGHT HILLARY CLINTON\nBY SURPRISE WITH THIS? THIS HAS NORMALLY BEEN AN ISSUE\nTHE ONLY THE DEMOCRATS OWN, LIKE TAKING CARE OF THE WOMEN ON THE\nPAID MATERNITY LEAVE AND NOW SUDDENLY HERE'S THIS UNORTHODOX\nREPUBLICAN CANDIDATE SAYING, YOU KNOW WHAT PART OF THAT MAKES\nSENSE TO ME TOO, I'M DOING IT. >> WELL, IT'S AN ISSUE THAT THE\nDEMOCRATS TALK ABOUT BUT THEY DON'T OWN.\nTHERE'S NO POLICY ON HILLARY CLINTON WEBSITE PERTAINING TO\nANY OF THESE ISSUES OF CHILDCARE, ELDER CARE OR\nMATERNITY LEAVE OR PATERNITY LEAVE FOR THAT MATTER.\nIT'S AN ISSUE THAT'S TALKED ABOUT ON THE STUMP BECAUSE WE\nRECOGNIZE THAT IT IS AFFECTING SO MANY AMERICAN FAMILIES.\nSO MANY MILLIONS OF AMERICAN FAMILIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY YET\nTHERE'S NO POLICY THAT'S BEEN ARTICULATED ON HOW TO SOLVE THE\nPROBLEM. WE THINK WE'VE PROPOSED\nSOMETHING THAT'S COMPREHENSIVE, VERY INNOVATIVE, A BOLD AND\nFRESH SOLUTION AND I THINK THIS IS WHAT THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY\nPROMISES. NEW SOLUTIONS, FRESH SOLUTIONS\nTO EXISTING PROBLEMS. AND YOU CAN SEE THE FULL PLAN ON\nMY FATHER'S WEBSITE DONALD J. TRUMP.COM.\nIT'S VERY WELL THOUGHT OUT. IT OF COURSE WILL BE PAID FOR\nAND IT WILL BE BAKED INTO THE COMPREHENSIVE TAX POLICY REFORM\nTHAT WILL BE PRESENTED ON THURSDAY.\n>> DO YOU -- I KNOW YOU'RE AN EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE\nTRUMP ORGANIZATION. DOES THAT ORGANIZATION OFFER\nPAID MATERNITY LEAVE TO ITS EMPLOYEES?\n>> IT DOES. >> OKAY.\n>> AS DOES MY OWN BUSINESS. >> SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT\nPEOPLE DON'T REALLY KNOW. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY KNOW THIS\nABOUT YOU. BUT YOU HAVE THREE YOUNG\nCHILDREN. YOU WERE RAISED BY A SUCCESSFUL\nFATHER. HE HAD MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.\nAND YET, YOU KNOW, YOU COULD HAVE TAKEN IT EASY.\nYOU ALSO MARRIED A VERY SUCCESSFUL MAN.\nAND PEOPLE ARE SAYING YOU HAVE THREE KIDS.\nYOU'RE KILLING YOURSELF. YOU ALREADY HAVE MILLIONS OF\nDOLLARS. EXPLAIN YOUR MIND-SET.\nWHAT DRIVES IVANKA TRUMP? >> WELL I'M DEEPLY PASSIONATE\nABOUT THE WORK THAT I DO AND I'M INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL TO BE A\nMOTHER AND A WIFE OPEN HAVE SUCH AN UNBELIEVABLE AND SUPPORTING\nHUSBAND AND HAVE THREE INCREDIBLE KIDS.\nI HAVE A 5-MONTH-OLD AS WELL.

AND SO MANY PARENTS ACROSS THIS\nCOUNTRY CAN'T MAKE THAT CHOICE. >> NOT EVERYBODY KNOWS THIS\nABOUT YOU, I CAN'T REVEAL WHAT IT IS BUT I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT\nIVANKA HAS BEEN OFFERED MANY VANITY PROJECTS, THINGS THAT\nWOULD ALLOW HER TO SORT OF BECOME MORE FAMOUS, MORE\nWELL-KNOWN AND SHE SAYS NO, NO, NO BECAUSE SHE LIKES THE JOB\nSHE'S DOING. SHE'S A BUSINESSWOMAN AT HEART.\nAND YOU'VE BEEN WELL EDUCATED FOR IT AND DO IT WELL.\nI WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT WOMEN. YOUR DAD HAS HAD SOME TROUBLE\nWITH THEM. HE'S 15% BEHIND HILLARY CLINTON\nIN THE POLLS. HE'S MADE COMMENTS ABOUT WOMEN\nTHAT HAVE LED TO THAT AND SOME OF THE ROUGH AND TUMBLE CAMPAIGN\nTACTICS LED TO THAT. I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED HOW YOU\nREACTED TO THAT, THE RETWEET OF HEIDI CRUZ.\nGIVE US A FLAVOR OF HOW THOSE EVENTS AFFECTED YOU AND YOUR\nREACTION. >> MY FATHER CAN BE AN EQUAL\nOPPORTUNITY OFFENDER. HE WILL SPEAK HIS MIND AND HE\nTREATS WOMEN EQUAL TO HOW HE TREATS MEN.\nHE'S SAID PLENTY OF ROUGH THINGS ABOUT MEN IN THE YEARS.\nAND I DISCOURAGE HIM FROM DOING THAT AS I DISCOURAGE HIM FROM\nDOING IT WITH WOMEN. BUT THE FACT THAT HE DOESN'T\nTREAT US DIFFERENTLY OR WITH KIT GLOVES SHOWS THE FACT THAT HE\nRECOGNIZES WE'RE EQUIPPED TO HANDLE IT AND ARE ABLE TO DO SO.\nSO, YOU KNOW, IN A CERTAIN WAY IT'S -- THERE'S NO BIAS.\nIN HIS VIEWPOINT. HE VIEWS ALL PEOPLE EQUALLY, MEN\nOR WOMEN, IT DOESN'T MATTER AND HE TREATS THEM ACCORDINGLY AND I\nTHIF WE'VE SEEN THAT. HE'S AUTHENTIC AND HE'LL TELL\nANYONE, MAN OR WOMAN WHAT HE'S THINKING AND HOW HE FEELS.\n>> BY ALL ACCOUNTS YOU'RE HIS TOP ADVISER AND HE HAS NOTHING\nBUT LOVE AND RESPECT FOR YOU.           <i> This fall at</i>\n         <i> Choice Hotels,</i>           <i> the more you</i>\n         <i> go the better!</i>      <i> Now earn a free night</i>        <i> when you stay with</i>\n       <i> us just two times.</i>          <i> Book direct at</i>\n       <i> ChoiceHotels.com.</i>    I've been taking Fish Oil      from Nature's Bounty\n      to support my heart.

THAT WAS A HORRIFIC DAY, A\nHORRIFIC TIME IN OUR COUNTRY. WE WERE ATTACKED BRUTALLY.\nAND THE FAMILIES -- ALL WE WANT IS JUSTICE FOR THAT MURDER.\n>> TERRY STRADA, 9/11 WIDOW BUT SO MUCH MORE.\nWE'LL HAVE MORE AFTER THIS.     When this busy family...  ...got a cracked windshield...   ...their dad went to the new\n      Safelite-Dot-Com...        ...and scheduled a\n         replacement... >>> ALL RIGHT.\nYOU KNOW DONALD TRUMP IS SERIOUS ABOUT REACHING OUT TO FEMALE\nVOTERS AND THOSE CONCERNED ABOUT FAMILY ISSUES WHEN HE BRINGS\nIVANKA OUT TO UNVEIL THE CHILDCARE PLAN.\nYOU CAN SEE THAT AT 7:30 P.M. EASTERN TIME.\nWE HAVE SENATE DEMOCRAT KATHY LYNN HERE, A DEMOCRATIC\nSTRATEGIST. KATHY, IF YOU BEGIN, IF YOU\nDON'T MIND, I'VE BEEN LOOKING THROUGH THE DETAILS AND IT\nSOUNDS LIKE BIG LIBERAL SPENDING.\n>> ON THE TRUMP PLAN? >> YEAH.\n>> TWO THINGS, I THINK HE'LL TALK ABOUT TWO THINGS IMPORTANT.\nAND THEY ARE MARKETEDLY DIFFERENT FROM HILLARY'S PLAN,\nWHICH IS REALLY GOING TO MAKE A BABY CRY BECAUSE IT IS AN INCOME\nREDISTRIBUTION PLAN AND PROMISES THE WORLD IT'S A GRANT TO\nPEOPLE. BUT TRUMP PROMISES TWO THINGS\nTHAT ARE INTERESTING, ONE, HE FOCUSES ON THE DEFINITION OF\nFAMILY AND EXPANDS THE DEFINITION TO INCLUDE SINGLE\nMOMS, SORRY, STAY-AT-HOME MOMS AND HE ALSO TRIES TO CREATE\nPARODY WITH TWO INCOME-WORKING FAMILIES VERSUS JUST SINGLE\nFAMILIES. >> PROVIDES MATERNITY LEAVE ON\nTHE GOVERNMENT -- >> THAT'S RIGHT.\n>> THAT IS VERY GENEROUS. I DON'T KNOW, HE'LL SPELL IT OUT\nPROBABLY HOW HE WILL PAY FOR THAT, BUT I'M LOOKING AT THIS TO\nTHINK IT IS A VERY CALCULATED AND TRUE MOVE TO WIN OVER WOMEN\nVOTERS WHO UP TO NOW HAVEN'T BEEN DRAWN TO HIS CANDIDACY.\nARE YOU WORRIED? >> NO, NOT AT ALL.\nI MEAN, THE REAL STARK DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO PLANS\nIS THAT HILLARY CLINTON ASKED THE WEALTHIEST OF ALL AMERICANS\nTO HELP FUND HER PLAN, TO MAKE SURE WE CAN HELP WORKING\nFAMILIES AND HELP WOMEN OUT THERE WHO NEED HELP WITH\nCHILDCARE AND PAID MEDICAL LEAVE AND PAID FAMILY LEAVE.\nSOME OF THE VERY ISSUES SHE'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT AFTER\nLISTENING TO VOTERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES.\nI'M GLAD SHE'S NOW -- >> YOU'RE CONVINCED OF THE TAX\nSHE'S IMPOSING ON WEALTHY FOLKS EVEN THOUGH IT GETS EXCESSIVE --\n>> IT'S THE WEALTHIEST OF ALL AMERICANS.\nTHEY ARE TALKING ABOUT -- >> HOW IS IT POSSIBLE WE KEEP\nLETTING THEM TAKE OUR MONEY? >> THAT'S RIGHT.\nSHAME ON THEM. >> KATHY, I UNDERSTAND WHAT\nDONALD TRUMP IS UP TO HERE, IT'S A GOOD STRATEGY, BUT AGAIN, HE\nDOES NOT SPELL OUT, AND THEY MEAN WELL, HILLARY CLINTON AND\nWHETHER YOU BUY HER MATH OR NOT, SHE SAYS I'M GOING TO SOCK IT TO\nTHE RICH. THEY ARE GOING TO PAY FOR IT.\nDOES HE? >> HE DOES.\nTHERE ARE TWO CREDITS AVAILABLE TODAY.\nAND WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT DOING IS CHANGING ONE OF THOSE\nTO BE MORE IN THE FORM OF A REDUCTION.\nAND HE'S PROPOSING THE SPENDING CARE ACCOUNTS VERY MUCH LIKE THE\nFSA ACCOUNTS. MOTIVATING AMERICANS TO PLAN, TO\nSAVE, TO SPEND IN A PREPARED PLANNED FASHION AND A PRACTICAL\nFASHION. THEY HAVE PROBABLY BEEN THE MOST\nSUCCESSFUL ELEMENT OF HEALTH CARE IN THIS COUNTRY IN THE LAST\nCOUPLE OF DECADES. SO THAT'S A VERY GOOD THING AND\nTHAT'S WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT. AND THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE.\nWE CAN'T JUST GIVE IT AWAY. WE DON'T HAVE IT TO GIVE.\n>> OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH A GOVERNMENT CAN DO.\nDO YOU THINK THERE IS A LIMIT TO GOVERNMENT LARGE DEBT?\n>> DO I THINK THAT THERE'S A LIMIT TO GOVERNMENT WHAT?\n>> SPENDING. >> OH, SPENDING.\nWELL, I DON'T, IN A SENSE THAT I",

LET'S LISTEN.\nSTORIES LIKE THESE GO STRAIGHT TO MY HEART, AND\nTHEY HAVE SEALED MY BELIEFS THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER\nWAY. I HAVE THREE YOUNG CHILDREN\nMYSELF, AND I'M GRATEFUL DAILY FOR THE MEANS TO\nPURSUE TWO OF MY DREAMS, BEING A MOTHER AND INVESTING\nIN A CAREER THAT FULFILLS ME.\nI RECOGNIZE THAT FAR TOO FEW WOMEN CAN SAY THE SAME FOR\nTHEMSELVES AND THAT I AM MORE FORTUNATE THAN MOST.\nTHIS MUST CHANGE. AS A SOCIETY, WE NEED TO\nCREATE POLICIES THAT CHAMPION ALL PARENTS\nENABLING THE AMERICAN FAMILY TO THRIVE.\nMY DAD AGREES AND HE IS IN A VERY UNIQUE POSITION TO DO\nSOMETHING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND NUMEROUS OTHER PROBLEMS\nFACING TENS OF MILLIONS OF PARENTS AND CAREGIVERS\nACROSS OUR COUNTRY. TODAY, CHILD CARE IS THE\nSINGLE GREATEST EXPENSE FOR MANY AMERICAN FAMILIES, EVEN\nEXCEEDING THE COST OF HOUSING IN MUCH OF THE\nCOUNTRY. IT'S DEPLETING THE HARD\nEARNED SAVINGS OF MEN AND WOMEN ACROSS OUR NATION AND\nIT'S AT THE ROOT OF WAGE INEQUALITY BY\nDISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTING WOMEN.\nTHE FEDERAL POLICIES THAT ARE IN PLACE TO BENEFIT\nFAMILIES WERE WRITTEN MORE THAN 65 YEARS AGO TO SERVE A\nPRIMARILY MALE WORKFORCE THAT NO LONGER EXISTS.\nDUAL INCOME FAMILIES WERE IN THE FORM IN 1949 WHEN TAX\nCODE REGARDING FAMILIES WERE ESTABLISHED.\nTODAY, HOWEVER, WOMEN REPRESENT 47% OF THE U.S.\nLABOR FORCE. AND IN ALMOST TWO THIRDS\nEVER MARRIED COUPLES, BOTH SPOUSES WORK OUTSIDE OF THE\nHOME. 70% OF MOTHERS WITH CHILDREN\nAT HOME ALSO WORK IN A PROFESSIONAL CAPACITY AND\n64% OF THESE MOMS HAVE KIDS AGE 6 AND UNDER.\nTHE NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLD LED BY SINGLE MOTHERS HAS\nDOUBLED IN THE LAST 30 YEARS.\nAND APPROXIMATELY TWO THIRDS OF THESE WOMEN WORK IN LOW\nWAGE JOBS THAT OFFER NEITHER FLEXIBILITY NOR BENEFITS.\nMY FATHER HAS CREATED A PLAN THAT IS DESIGNED TO BRING\nRELIEF AND TO PROVIDE WORKING PARENTS WITH OPTIONS\nSO THAT THEY CAN MAKE THE DECISIONS THAT ARE IN THE\nBEST INTEREST OF THEIR FAMILIES.\nSAFE, AFFORD BEING, HIGH QUALITY CHILD CARE SHOULD\nNOT BE THE LUXURY OF A FOR THAT THE FEW.\nHISTORICALLY, THIS HAS NOT BEEN AN AREA THAT HAS\nRECEIVED NEARLY AS MUCH ATTENTION IN THE POLICY\nWORLD AS IT DESERVES. WHILE THERE ARE SYSTEMS IN\nPLACE FOR OLDER CHILDREN, HARDLY ANY INTELLECTUAL\nENERGY HAS BEEN DEVOTED TO ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF\nFAMILIES WITH CHILDREN FROM BIRTH TO 4 YEARS OLD IN\nPARTICULAR, LITTLE FOCUS HAS BEEN PUT ON HOW BEST TO\nELEAVE UNITED STATES THE ENORMOUS BURDENS PLACES ON\nLOW INCOME AND MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES.\nAT THE SAME TIME, THE UNITED STATES IS THE ONLY\nINDUSTRIALIZED NATION IN THE WORLD THAT DOES NOT PROVIDE\nNEW MOTHERS WITH PAID MATERNITY LEAVE.\nMY FATHER'S POLICY WILL GIVE PAID LEAVE TO MOTHERS WHOSE\nEMPLOYERS ARE AMONG THE ALMOST 90% OF U.S.\nBUSINESSES THAT CURRENTLY DO NOT OFFER THIS BENEFIT.\nTHIS IS A REFORM THAT IS OF CRITICAL VALUE AND LONG\nOVERDUE. MY FATHER'S PLAN ALSO\nRECOGNIZES AND SUPPORTS THE MANY WOMEN WHO MAY NOT BE\nMOTHERS BUT WHO HAVE LEFT PAYING JOBS TO PROVIDE\nELDERLY DEPENDENTS. THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE\nROUTINELY IGNORED BY FEDERAL POLICIES.\nHAVING EMPLOYED AND EMPOWERED THOUSANDS OF WOMEN\nAT EVERY LEVEL OF HIS COMPANY THROUGHOUT HIS\nENTIRE CAREER, MY FATHER UNDERSTANDS THE NEEDS OF THE\nMODERN WORKFORCE AND IS OFFERING A NEW AND\nINNOVATIVE SOLUTION WHERE OTHERS HAVE NOT.\nMY FATHER'S PLAN ALSO ACKNOWLEDGES THE VITAL\nCONTRIBUTION OF STAY-AT-HOME MOMS AND PARENTS, FATHERS\nAND MOTHERS. WHO WILL ENSURE THAT THEY,\nTOO, WILL RECEIVE THESE NEW TAX BENEFITS.\nRAISING CHILDREN FULL TIME IS ONE OF THE HARDEST JOBS\nANYONE CAN DO. AND IT'S ESSENTIAL THAT OUR\nPOLICIES RECOGNIZE AND HONOR THAT REALITY.\nAS AN EMPLOYER, A MOTHER, AND A WOMAN WHO WORKS BOTH\nINSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE HOME, THESE ARE TOPICS I CONSIDER\nOF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE. THE POLICY MY FATHER IS IF\nB. TO OUTLINE IS ONE I HAVE HELPED CONCEPTUALIZE AND\nENSURING ITS ENACTMENT WILL BE ONE OF MY TOP PRIORITIES\nWHEN HE IS ELECTED COME NOVEMBER.\n[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THIS IS NOT A WOMAN'S ISSUE.\nIT'S A FAMILY ISSUE. IT'S AN AMERICAN ISSUE.\nIT'S AN ISSUE THAT'S OFTEN BEEN DISCUSSED BUT IS YET TO\nBE SOLVED. MY FATHER PLANS TO CHANGE\nTHAT. AND NOW HE WILL TELL YOU\nHOW. IT IS WITH GREAT ADMIRATION\nAND RESPECT THAT I INTRODUCE TO YOU OUR NEXT PRESIDENT\nAND MY FATHER, DONALD J. TRUMP.\n[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU, THANK YOU\nEVERYBODY. THAT'S NICE.\nBEAUTIFUL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nAND I WANT TO APPLAUD MY DAUGHTER IVANKA FOR HER WORK\nAND LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE.\n[ APPLAUSE ] >> SHE HAS BEEN WORKING SO\nVERY HARD. IVANKA HAS BEEN DEEPLY\nINVESTED IN THIS SINCE LONG BEFORE THE CAMPAIGN BEGAN.\nI CAN TELL YOU THAT AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO HER FOR HER\nWORK, HER EFFORTS, AND THIS PROPOSAL, WHICH WE'RE GOING\nTO BE OUTLINING RIGHT AWAY. I THINK IT'S GOING TO MAKE A\nLOT OF PEOPLE VERY, VERY HAPPY, A LOT OF MOMS VERY\nHAPPY. I WANT TO ALSO TAKE A MOMENT\nTO RECOGNIZE CONGRESSWOMAN CATHY McMORRIS ROGERS, THE\nCHAIR WOMAN OF THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE.\nAND A MOTHER OF THREE SMALL CHILDREN, WHO HAS BEEN SUCH\nA LEADER AND WORKED SO HARD WITH US.\nSO, CATHY, WE WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nALSO, WOOR JOINED TONIGHT BY AMAZING MEMBERS OF CONGRESS\nIN OUR AUDIENCE. CONGRESSWOMAN BLACKBURN,\nLOOMIS, BLACK, HARTZLER, AND EMLER, COME ON, THEY WORKED\nSO HARD ON THIS. COME ON UP. >> SOMEBODY GOAT UP AND SAY\nSOMETHING. >> I WILL TELL YOU, MY NAME\nIS MARCIA BLACKBURN. I'M FROM THE GREAT STATE OF\nTENNESSEE. I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO\nALL OF YOU FOR THE WARM RECEPTION THAT YOU HAVE\nGIVEN TO US I WANT TO SAY A SPECIAL THANK YOU TO\nMR. TRUMP FOCUSING ON THE ISSUES THAT AFFECT WORKING\nWOMEN IS SOMETHING THAT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT TO EACH OF\nUS STANDING ON THIS STAGE. WE COME FROM A VARIETY OF\nBACKGROUND. WE HAVE A NURSE.\nWE HAVE FARMERS. WE HAVE RANCHERS.\nWE HAVE TEACHERS. WE HAVE SMALL BUSINESS\nOWNERS AND ENTREPRENEURS THAT'S THE SKILL SET THAT WE\nBRING TO CONGRESS AND THE EXPERIENCE THAT WE DRAW\nFROM. WE KNOW EACH OF YOU ARE MUCH\nLIKE US. THOSE ARE THE EXPERIENCES\nTHAT YOU HAVE. WE KNOW THERE ARE ISSUES\nWHEN IT COMES TO CHILD CARE, WHEN IT COMES TO DEALING\nWITH THE WORK PLACE. AND JUST AS IVANKA SAID, SO\nPERFECTLY, THIS IS A FAMILY ISSUE WE KNOW WOMEN WANT\nMORE MONEY WHAT DO WOMEN WANT?\nMORE TIME. AND WE ARE THRILLED TO\nFINALLY HAVE A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO IS\nGOING TO PUT THE FOCUS ON WORKING WITH WOMEN TO MAKE\nCERTAIN THAT YOU CAN ACHIEVE YOUR AMERICAN DREAM THANK\nYOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING US. >> THANK YOU.\n>> I'M SO PROUD OF YOU. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nMAYOR GIULIANI, PLEASE STAND UP.\nRUDY GIULIANI. THE NATION'S MAYOR.\nOH, HE HAS DONE A GOOD JOB. SO, OUR CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT\nIDEAS. WE'RE ABOUT SOLUTIONS TO\nBIG, BIG PROBLEMS. PROBLEMS THAT HAVE GONE ON\nFOREVER. I HAVE TRAVELED ALL OVER THE\nCOUNTRY IN RECENT WEEKS OFFERING DETAILED PLANS TO\nMAKE LIFE BETTER FOR YOU AND FOR YOUR FAMILY.\nSO IMPORTANT TO ME. I HAVE OUTLINED DETAILED\nPROPOSALS FOR PROVIDING SCHOOL CHOICE.\nWE HAVE TO DO THAT, REFORMING OUR TAX AND\nREGULATORY CODE. LITTLING RESTRICTIONS ON\nAMERICAN ENERGY. REBUILDING OUR MILITARY.\nCHANGING OUR FOREIGN POLICY. FIXING OUR IMMIGRATION, SO\nIMPORTANT. AND KEEPING OUR COUNTRY\nSAFE. [ APPLAUSE ]\nRIGHT NOW, THANK YOU. RIGHT NOW OUR POLITICIANS\nHAVE LOCKED OUR COUNTRY INTO ENDLESS FIGHTS ABOUT SMALL\nAND PETTY THINGS. I'M ASKING THE NATION TO\nLIFT OUR SIGHTS AND TO IMAGINE WHAT WE CAN\nACCOMPLISH IF WE WORK TOGETHER, TRUST EACH OTHER,\nAND PUT THE NEEDS OF OUR CITIZENS FIRST FOR A CHANGE\nWE MUST BREAK OUR TIES WITH THE FAILED AND BITTER\nPOLITICS OF THE PAST AND PURSUE A FUTURE WHERE EVERY\nAMERICAN IS HONORED, AND I MEAN REALLY HONORED AND\nRESPECTED WE HAVE TO REJECT THE ARROGANCE OF WASHINGTON,\nD.C. THAT LOOKS DOWN ON EVERY DAY HARD-WORKING\nPEOPLE. AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.\n[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] TOO OFTEN THOSE THAT HAVE\nPOWER HAVE DISDAIN FOR THE VIEWS, BELIEFS, AND\nATTITUDES OF THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE ANY POLITICAL POWER\nTHOSE IN LEADERSHIP MUST PUT THEMSELVES IN THE SHOES OF\nTHE LAID OLFACTORY WORKER, THE FAMILY WORRIED ABOUT\nSECURITY, OR THE MOM STRUGGLING TO AFFORD CHILD\nCARE. CHILD CARE IS SUCH A BIG\nPROBLEM. [ APPLAUSE ]\nWE'RE GOING TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM.\nTHAT MEANS WE NEED WORKING MOTHERS TO BE FAIRLY\nCOMPENSATED FOR THEIR WORK AND HAVE ACCESS TO\nAFFORDABLE, QUALITY CHILD CARE FOR THEIR KIDS.\nTHAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING. [ APPLAUSE ]\nWE WANT HIGHER PAY, BETTER WAGES, AND A GROWING ECONOMY\nFOR EVERYONE. THESE SOLUTIONS MUST UPDATE\nLAWS PASSED MORE THAN A HALF A CENTURY AGO WHEN MOST\nWOMEN WERE STILL NOT IN THE LABOR FORCE.\nMOST OF THEM WEREN'T EVEN CLOSE.\nTODAY, NEARLY TWO IN THREE MOTHERS WITH YOUNG CHILDREN\nHAVE JOBS. FOR MANY FAMILIES IN OUR\nCOUNTRY, CHILD CARE IS NOW THE SINGLE LARGEST EXPENSE.\nWHO WOULD THINK THAT, EVEN MORE SO THAN HOUSING.\nYET, VERY LITTLE MEANINGFUL POLICY WORK HAS BEEN DONE IN\nTHIS AREA. AND MY OPPONENT HAS NO CHILD\nCARE PLAN. SHE NEVER WILL.\nAND IF IT EVER EVOLVES INTO A PLAN IT WILL NEVER GET\nDONE ANYWAY. ALL TALK, NO ACTION.\n[ APPLAUSE ] MANY MEASURES ARE JUST ONE\nCRISIS AWAY FROM DISASTER. A SICK KID, A LOST JOB.\nA DANGED HOME THERE IS NO FINANCIAL SECURITY IN OUR\nCOUNTRY, ESPECIALLY ANYMORE. BUT THAT WILL CHANGE UNDER\nOUR PRO-FAMILY, WHEN YOU JUST TAKE A LOOK, IT'S\nPRO-FAMILY, IT'S PRO-CHILD, IT'S PRO-WORKER.\nTHESE ARE THE PEOPLE WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF AND THIS IS\nWHAT I'M GOING TO BE OUTLINING TONIGHT.\n[ APPLAUSE ] BEFORE GOING ANY FURTHER I\nWANT EVERYBODY WATCHING ON TV AND THERE ARE A LOT OF\nPEOPLE RIGHT NOW TO GO TO DONALD J. TRUMP.COM TO READ\nTHE FULL PLAN. GREAT DETAIL.\nTHE FIRST PART OF MY CHILD CARE PLAN ALLOWS FOR EVERY\nPARENT OR FAMILY IN AMERICA, INCLUDING ADOPTIVE PARENTS\nAND FOSTER PARENT GUARDIANS TO DEDUCT THEIR CHILD CARE\nEXPENSES FROM THEIR INCOME TAXES.\nTHAT'S A FIRST. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]\nI SEE THE WOMEN WHO I JUST MET IN THE FRONT ROW VERY\nHAPPY ABOUT THAT.  THEY WILL BE FULLY ABLE TO DEDUCT THE\nAVERAGE COST OF CHILD CARE FROM THEIR STATE FROM BIRTH\nTHROUGH THE AGE OF 13. BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE\nBENEFIT IS CAPPED AND STRUCTURED OUR PLAN WILL\nBRING RELIEF TO WORKING AND MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES.\nTHE DEDUCTION ALSO APPLIES TO ELDER CARE, CAPPED AT\n$5,000 DEDUCTION PER YEAR. $5,000 DEDUCTION.\nIMPORTANTLY, OUR POLICY ALSO SUPPORTS MOTHERS WHO CHOOSE\nTO STAY AT HOME AND HONORS AND RECOGNIZES THEIR\nINCREDIBLE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THEIR FAMILIES AND TO OUR\nSOCIETY. [ APPLAUSE ]\nFAMILIES WITH A STAY-AT-HOME PARENT WILL BE ABLE TO FULLY\nDEDUCT THE AVERAGE COST OF CHILD CARE FROM THEIR TAXES.\nIT'S A BIG THING. I'M HEARING WOW.\nI LIKE TO HEAR WOW. THE CONGRESSWOMEN LIKE TO\nHEAR WOW. IT MAKES YOUR LIFE A LOT\nEASIER, RIGHT? FOR LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS\nWHO HAVE NO NET INCOME, TAX LIABILITY.\nWE WILL OFFER EXPANDED EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT IN\nTHE FORM OF A CHILD CARE REBATE.\n[ APPLAUSE ] WORKING PARENTS CAN GET AN\nEXPANDED EITC BENEFIT THAT EQUALS UP TO HALF OF THEIR\nTOTAL PAYROLL TAX. A MAJOR RELIEF FOR LOW\nINCOME PARENTS. LOW INCOME PARENTS HAVE IT\nTOUGHER THAN ANYBODY. THIS TRANSLATES TO AS MUCH\nAS AN EXTRA $1,200 IN EITC BENEFITS FOR WORKING\nFAMILIES. [ APPLAUSE ]\nNEXT, OUR PLAN ALLOWS EVERY PARENT IN AMERICA TO OPEN UP\nA DEPENDENT CARE SAVINGS ACCOUNT.\nFAMILIES CAN CONTRIBUTE UP TO $2,000 A YEAR TO THESE\nACCOUNTS, COMPLETELY TAX-FREE.\nSHE IS VERY HAPPY ABOUT THAT.\nIVANKA IS VERY HAPPY ABOUT THIS.\nCRUCIALLY, UNLIKE THE FLEXIBLE SPENDING ACCOUNTS\nTHAT EXIST TODAY, THESE ACCOUNTS WILL BE AVAILABLE\nTO ALL AMERICANS. YOU WON'T HAVE TO DEPEND ON\nYOUR EMPLOYER TO PROVIDE THEM.\nIMMEDIATE FAMILY AND EMPLOYERS CAN -- THIS IS\nLIKE RIGHT AWAY, CAN ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO A DEPENDENT\nACCOUNT EACH OF WHICH IS DESIGNED AND DESIGNATED FOR\nSPECIFIC CHILD, INCLUDING AN UNBORN CHILD.\nTHE MONEY THAT IS PUT INTO THESE ACCOUNTS CAN ALSO BE\nSPENT, NOT ONLY ON CHILD CARE BUT ALSO CHILD\nENRICHMENT ACTIVITIES. SEE?\nWE WILL START WITH THAT CHILD.\nTHAT WILL BE OUR FIRST CHILD.\n[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT'S CUTE.\nADDITIONALLY, THE FUNDS IN THESE ACCOUNTS DO NOT EXPIRE\nAT THE END OF THE YEAR, THEY DON'T REVERT TO EMPLOYERS OR\nTO THE TREASURY. INSTEAD, THE FUNDS ROLL OVER\nSO THAT WHILE ONLY $2,000 CAN BE CONTRIBUTED EACH\nYEAR, UNSPENT SUMS CAN ACCUMULATE AND CREATE\nSUBSTANTIAL SAVINGS. TREMENDOUS SAVINGS,\nACTUALLY. THESE SAVINGS CAN BE USED BY\nPARENTS TO HELP GIVE THEIR KIDS SCHOOL CHOICE AND WILL,\nTHUS, CONTRIBUTE TO THE SCHOOL CHOICE REFORMS I\nOUTLINED LAST WEEK. A LOT OF GOOD OUTLINES LAST\nWEEK ON SCHOOLS. AND REALLY POPULAR, I WILL\nTELL YOU. THE FUNDS WILL REMAIN IN THE\nACCOUNT UNTIL THE AGE OF 18. WHATEVER STILL REMAINS AT\nTHAT TIME CAN BE USED TO HELP OFFSET THE COST OF\nHIGHER EDUCATION FOR YOUR CHILD.\nFOR LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL\nPROVIDE MATCHING FUNDS IF PARENTS CONTRIBUTE $1,000,\nTHE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL PROVIDE A $500 MATCH.\nTO HELP LOW INCOME FAMILIES REACH THESE TARGETS AND SAVE\nMONEY, WE WILL PUT A BOX ON FEDERAL INCOME TAX FORMS\nALLOWING THESE PARENTS TO HAVE THEIR EARNED INCOME TAX\nCREDIT FUNDS DIRECTLY DEPOSITED INTO THEIR\nDEPENDENT CARE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS.\nPRETTY SIMPLE. THESE DEPENDENT CARE SAVINGS\nACCOUNTS CAN ALSO BE SET UP TO PROVIDE CARE FOR HE WOULD\nKERRLY DEPENDENTS OF WHICH WE HAVE MANY.\nMANY, MANY, MANY. OUR PLAN ALSO INCLUDES MUCH\nNEEDED REGULATORY REFORM TO INCENTIVIZE PRIVATE SECTOR\nSOLUTIONS. THE NEW FUNDS OFFERED BY OUR\nPLAN WILL CREATE A NEW MARKET FOR INNOVATIVE CHILD\nCARE SOLUTIONS. BUT TO MAKE SURE THESE\nSOLUTIONS ARE AVAILABLE, ESPECIALLY IN LOW INCOME AND\nRURAL COMMUNITIES, WE MUST REDUCE REGULATIONS THAT\nFAVOR LARGE INSTITUTIONAL CARE FACILITIES.\nYOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.\nIT'S CALLED SPECIAL INTEREST GOT THEM THERE.\nWE WILL ALLOW THE STATES TO MAKE THE DECISIONS THAT ARE\nRIGHT FOR THEM. IN THIS ERA OF SHARING\nECONOMY, WE WANT PARENTS TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS LOWER\nCOSTS, COMPETITIVE AND INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS AT THE\nCLICK OF A BUTTON, INCLUDING SURFACES LIKE NANNY SHARING\nOUR PLAN WOULD ALSO COVER CARE PROVIDED BY RELATIVES\nAND GRAND PARENTS, INCENTIVES FOR EMPLOYERS TO\nOFFER ON SIGHT CHILD CARE AS WELL.\nWE WANT EMPLOYERS TO GET INVOLVED.\nNOW THEY WILL START GETTING INVOLVED BIG LEAGUE, RIGHT?\n[ APPLAUSE ] AND YOU WILL START LIKING\nYOUR EMPLOYER A LOT MORE. THAT'S ONE OF THE BENEFITS.\n[ LAUGHTER ] THIS CAN ALSO BE A GOOD\nWORKING SOLUTION FOR MANY WORKING PARENTS AND CAN SAVE\nTHEM 30 MINUTES IN COMMUTE TIME.\nTHAT'S A LOT. CURRENTLY ONLY 7% OF THESE\nEMPLOYERS PROVIDE THESE. EXPAND FOR EMPLOYERS.\nALLOW COMPANY TO PROVIDE POOL -- PROVIDE SHARED CHILD\nCARE SERVICE WAS AND WE MOVE KNOWEDLESS APPRECIATES THE\nEMPLOYERS. THE REQUIREMENTS ARE ONEROUS\nNEVER GET TO USE IT EVEN THOUGH THEY WOULD LIKE TO.\nOUR PLAN OFFERS A CRUCIAL SAFETY NET FORK WORKING\nMOTHERS WHOSE EMPLOYERS DO NOT PROVIDE PAID MATERNITY\nLEAVE. THIS SOLUTION WILL RECEIVE\nSTRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT?\nDO YOU THINK? WHEN YOU GOD TO THE OTHER\nSIDE THEY WILL BE OKAY? I'M HEARING THEY WILL BE.\nWE WILL GET THEM TO BE OKAY, RIGHT?\nAND WE WILL BE COMPLETELY SELF-FINANCES.\nI THINK YOU WILL. YOU WILL HAVE BY PARTISAN\nSUPPORT. BY RECAPTURING FRAWSHED AND\nIMPROPER PAYMENTS IN THE INSURANCE PROGRAM WE CAN\nPROVIDE SIX WEEKS OF PAID MATERNITY LEAVE TO ANY\nMOTHER WITH A NEWBORN CHILD WHOSE EMPLOYER DOES NOT\nPROVIDE THE BENEFIT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]\nTHIS MATERNITY LEAVE WILL BE PAID STRAIGHT OUT PRESIDENT\nUNEMPLOYED INSURANCE FUND. AGAIN, THE SAFETY NET WILL\nBE COMPLETELY PAID FOR THROUGH SAVINGS WITHIN THE\nPROGRAM. THERE ARE MORE REFORMS AND\nSOLUTIONS IN OUR CHILD CARE PLAN.\nAND YOU CAN REVIEW THEM ALL ON THE WEBSITE.\nON THURSDAY, I WILL OWG MY FULL ECONOMIC PLAN\nCOMPLETELY PAID FOR THROUGH ECONOMIC.\nIT'SING IF TO BE SOMETHING SPECIAL LIKE THIS COUNTRY\nHASN'T SEEN IN MANY, MANY DECADES.\n[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] TOGETHER OUR TAX, TRADE,\nREGULATORY AND ENERGY POLICIES WILL AD TRILLIONS\nAND TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN NEW DEFICIT LOWERING GROWTH.\nTHESE ARE THE KINDS OF SOLUTIONS I WANT TO BRING TO\nTHE WHITE HOUSE AS YOUR PRESIDENT.\nIT'S TIME TO FREE OURSELVES FROM THE BASKETS THAT\nPOLITICIANS TRY TO PUT US INTO AND ALWAYS HAVE PUT US\nINTO AND, INSTEAD, TO WORK TOGETHER AND I THINK YOU\nKNOW WHAT I MEAN. THAT INCLUDES DEMOCRATS,\nREPUBLICANS AND ALL AMERICANS.\n[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I THINK YOU KNOW THANK YOU\nVERY MUCH. THANK YOU.\nYEAH, I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.\nWHILE MY OPPONENT SLANDERS YOU AS DEPLORABLE AND\nIRREDEEMABLE, I CALL YOU HARD-WORKING AMERICAN\nPATRIOTS WHO LOVE YOUR COUNTRY, LOVE YOUR FAMILY\nAND WANT A BETTER FUTURE FOR ALL-AMERICANS.\n[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHANTING]\n>> THANK YOU. THANK YOU.\nIT'S TIME TO END THE RULE OF SPECIAL INTEREST AND TO\nBEGIN THE RULE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\nTHAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. IT'S GOING TO BE A BIG\nCHANGE. IT'S TIME TO STOP FIGHTING\nOVER THE SMALLEST WORDS AND TO START DREAMING ABOUT THE\nGREAT ADVENTURES THAT LIE AHEAD FOR OUR INCREDIBLE\nCOUNTRY. IT'S TIME TO START BELIEVING\nIN AMERICA AGAIN. TOGETHER --\n>> -- -- I PROMISE YOU, TOGETHER, WE WILL MAKE OUR\nCOUNTRY STRONG AGAIN. WE WILL MAKE OUR COUNTRY\nPROSPEROUS AGAIN. WE WILL MAKE OUR COUNTRY\nGREAT AGAIN. GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE.\nTHANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nGOD BLESS YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nTHANK YOU. THANK YOU.\nAND, IVANKA, THANK YOU. CONGRESSWOMEN, THANK YOU\nVERY MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]\n>> THAT WAS DONALD TRUMP WRAPPING UP THE SPEECH IN\nPHILADELPHIA, THE SUBURB WHERE HE LAID OUT A PLAN\nTHAT GUARANTEES AMERICA MOTHERS SIX WEEKS OF NEED\nAND DONALD TRUMP A VARIETY OF WAYS.\nDONALD TRUMP TRYING TO CLOSE THE GAP ON WOMEN.\nDID HE ALIENATE THE REPUBLICAN COMMENT.\nI DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THE MICROOF THE PLAN.\nLET PEOPLE GO TO THE WEBSITE IT IS NOT THE USUAL\nREPUBLICAN SMALLER GOVERNMENT SITUATION.\nIT'S AN EXPANSION OF THE ENTITLEMENT SYSTEM.\nDO YOU THINK MR. TRUMP IS GOING TO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH\nTHAT? >> WELL, IF HE BECOMES\nPRESIDENT, HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE PROBLEMS WITH\nTHE CONSERVATIVE FISCAL PARTY IN WASHINGTON BECAUSE\nTHERE IS A MASSIVE, ALMOST 20 TRILLION-DOLLAR NATIONAL\nDEBT THAT HAS CAUSED FISCAL CLIFFS AND GOVERNMENT\nSHUTDOWNS. AND THAT WILL BE AN ISSUE.\nWHAT TRUMP IS REALLY DOING HERE IS LAYING OUT A POLICY\nTHAT HE WILL TRY TO IMPLEMENT IF HE BECOMES\nPRESIDENT.

I KNOW YOU PASSED OUT, HIT YOUR\nHEAD IN 2012 WHICH LED TO THE CONCUSSION.\nHOW OFTEN HAS THIS HAPPENED? >> OH, I THINK REALLY ONLY TWICE\nTHAT I CAN RECALL. YOU KNOW, IT IS SOMETHING THAT\nHAS OCCURRED A FEW TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF MY LIFE, AND I'M\nAWARE OF IT AND USUALLY CAN AVOID IT.\nWHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY WAS THAT I JUST WAS INCREDIBLY COMMITTED\nTO BEING AT THE MEMORIAL, AS A SENATOR ON 9/11, THIS IS\nINCREDIBLY PERSONAL TO ME, AND I COULD, YOU KNOW, FEEL HOW HOT\nAND HUMID IT WAS. I FELT OVERHEATED.\nI DECIDED THAT I DID NEED TO LEAVE, AND AS SOON AS I GOT INTO\nTHE AIR-CONDITIONED VAN, I COOLED OFF, I GOT SOME WATER AND\nVERY QUICKLY I FELT BETTER.

YOU BLAMED IT ON ALLERGIES,\nJOKED AT ONE POINT YOU WERE ALLERGIC TO DONALD TRUMP.\nWAS THAT COUGH ACTUALLY PNEUMONIA RELATED AND NOT, IN\nFACT, ALLERGY RELATED? >> WELL, IT SURE SEEMED LIKE IT\nWAS AN ALLERGY BECAUSE I'VE HAD ALLERGIES, SEASONAL ALLERGIES\nOFF AND ON, AND IT DOES COME WITH A COUGH.\nI'VE GOT LOTS OF EXAMPLES OF, YOU KNOW, IN THE SPRING AND IN\nTHE FALL, GETTING A BIT OF A COUGHING FIT, THEN IT\nDISSIPATES.

AND THE FUNNIEST THING THAT\nHAPPENED TO ME ON SUNDAY, WASN'T A FUNNY DAY, AFTER ALL, BUT THIS\nWAS KIND OF HUMOROUS, IS I GOT TO THE MEMORIAL, I SAW MY FRIEND\nAND FORMER COLLEAGUE, CHUCK SCHUMER, AND THE FIRST THING HE\nSAYS TO ME IS I'VE HAD PNEUMONIA AND I'VE BEEN RESTING FOR FIVE\nDAYS. AND I LOOKED AT HIM, I SAID, YOU\nKNOW, THAT'S SO FUNNY, I'VE JUST BEEN TOLD I HAVE PNEUMONIA.\nAPPARENTLY THERE'S SOMETHING TO THIS THAT'S GOING AROUND.\nI'VE SINCE BEEN CONTACTED BY A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO'VE TOLD ME\nTHEY HAVE HAD IT, THEY'VE GOTTEN OVER IT.\n>> LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THAT BECAUSE DAVID AXELROD WAS VERY\nCRITICAL OF THE WAY THAT YOU AND YOUR CAMPAIGN HANDLED SHARING\nYOUR DIAGNOSIS WITH THE PUBLIC.

AND CALLING IN TO THE SAN\nFRANCISCO FUND-RAISER SHE WAS FORCED TO MISS.\n>> I WISH SO MUCH I COULD BE THERE.\n>> Reporter: CLINTON TELLS CNN SHE NEVER LOST CONSCIOUSNESS\nWHEN SHE LOST HER BALANCE WHEN LEAVING SUNDAY'S 9/11 MEMORIAL\nSERVICE. >> I FELT OVERHEATED.\nI DECIDED THAT I DID NEED TO LEAVE AND AS SOON AS I GOT INTO\nTHE AIR CONDITIONED VAN I COOLED OFF, I GOT SOME WATER AND VERY\nQUICKLY I FELT BETTER. >> Reporter: HER HUSBAND, BILL\nCLINTON, SAYS THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME SHE'S HAD SUCH AN\nINCIDENT. >> RARELY BUT ON MORE THAN ONE\nOCCASION OVER THE LAST MANY, MANY YEARS THE SAME SORT OF\nTHINGS HAPPEN TO HER. >> I THINK REALLY ONLY TWICE.\nTHAT HAS OCCURRED A FEW TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF MY LIFE.\nBACK IN 2012 CLINTON FAINTED AT HER HOME SUFFERING A CONCUSSION\nWHICH HER HUSBAND SAID TOOK HER SIX MONTHS TO RECOVER FROM.\nAT THE TIME THE STATE DEPARTMENT DOWNPLAYED IT AS A STOMACH VIRUS\nAND DEHYDRATION. TRUMP ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL\nUNUSUALLY QUIET ABOUT CLINTON'S HEALTH AS BOTH CANDIDATES VOW TO\nRELEASE MORE MEDICAL INFORMATION THIS WEEK.\n>> I'LL BE RELEASING VERY, VERY SPECIFIC NUMBERS.\n>> WE'LL HAVE MORE INFORMATION, BUT I'VE ALREADY RELEASED\nINFORMATION ABOUT MY HEALTH IN THIS CAMPAIGN AS WELL AS NEARLY\n40 YEARS OF TAX RETURNS. WE'VE ALREADY MET A HIGH\nSTANDARD OF TRANSPARENCY, AND WE KNOW THE LEAST ABOUT DONALD\nTRUMP OF ANY CANDIDATE IN RECENT AMERICAN HISTORY.\n>> Reporter: NOW THIS MORNING THE CLIP TON CAMPAIGN IS TRYING\nTO GO BACK ON THE OFFENSIVE AND TURN THE PAGE AND TALK ABOUT\nWHAT TRUMP HAS NOT RELEASED. HIS TAX RETURNS OR HIS MEDICAL\nRECORDS. THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS ALSO OUT\nWITH A NEW AD. YOU CAN SEE IT RIGHT HERE\nSHOWING HOW THEY BELIEVE TRUMP HAS INSULTED AND DEMEANED SOME\nAMERICANS. ONCE AGAIN, THEY'RE TRYING TO\nUSE TRUMP'S OWN WORDS AGAINST HIM.\nYOU CAN SEE IT RIGHT THERE, AND THEY'RE TRYING TO USE REALLY THE\nWHOLE CAMPAIGN, EVERYTHING HE SAID, PLAY IT BACK FOR HIM AND\nTHAT AD IS PLAYING IN A BATTLE GROUPED STATE NEAR YOU.\n>> OKAY. JEFF, THANKS SO MUCH FOR ALL OF\nTHAT. >>> WELL, LET'S GET MORE NOW OF\nANDERSON COOPER'S EXCLUSIVE WITH HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHE FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE SPEAKING OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME\nSINCE FALLING ILL WITH PNEUMONIA.\nLISTEN. >> THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS WHO\nARE VERY WORRIED ABOUT YOU. HOW ARE YOU FEELING?\n>> OH, THANK YOU, ANDERSON. I'M FEELING SO MUCH BETTER, AND\nOBVIOUSLY I SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN SOME REST SOONER.\nI PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF IF I HAD JUST PULLED\nDOWN MY SCHEDULE ON FRIDAY, BUT LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE, I JUST\nTHOUGHT I COULD KEEP GOING FORWARD AND POWER THROUGH IT,\nAND OBVIOUSLY THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT SO WELL.\nI GOT TO THE MEMORIAL. I SAW MY FRIEND AND FORMER\nCOLLEAGUE, CHUCK SCHUMER, AND THE FIRST THING HE SAID TO ME\nIS, I'VE HAD PNEUMONIA AND I'VE BEEN RESTING FOR FIVE DAYS.\nI LOOKED AT HIM, I SAID, YOU KNOW, THAT'S SO FUNNY, I'VE JUST\nBEEN TOLD I HAVE PNEUMONIA. APPARENTLY THERE'S SOMETHING TO\nTHIS THAT'S GOING AROUND. >> DAVID AXLEROD WAS VERY\nCRITICAL OF THE WAY THAT YOU AND YOUR CAMPAIGN HANDLED SHARING\nYOUR DIAGNOSIS WITH THE PUBLIC.",

THEY SAID, OH, SHE WAS\nDEHYDRATED, SHE LEFT ON HER OWN ACCORD AND THEY SORT OF SEEMED\nTO SAY THAT EVERYTHING WAS FINE AND MAYBE EVERYTHING WAS FINE,\nBUT THE SORT OF SEVERITY OF THE SITUATION WAS ONLY REVEALED\nREALLY BECAUSE OF THAT VIDEO. >> AND HAD -- YOU KNOW, I ASKED\nHER ABOUT THIS WHEN SHE LEFT HER DAUGHTER'S APARTMENT, SHE SAID,\nYOU KNOW, I'M FEELING GREAT AND, YOU KNOW, I SORT OF CHALLENGED\nHER ON THAT TONIGHT, LIKE, YOU COULDN'T HAVE BEEN REALLY\nFEELING GREAT. SHE SAID ACTUALLY I WAS FEELING\nGREAT.

LATER THAT NIGHT.\n>> YOU CAN MAKE THE ARGUMENT, SOME OF HER SUPPORTERS HAVE,\nTHEY WANTED TO WAIT UNTIL SHE WAS CHECKED OUT AGAIN TO KNOW\nWHAT THEY WERE DEALING WITH, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, THEY HAVE\nBEEN THROUGH HEALTH ISSUES WITH HER IN THE PAST.\nOBVIOUSLY, WHAT HAPPENED IN 2012 WITH HER CONCUSSION WAS VERY\nDIFFERENT THAN WHAT APPEARS TO BE HAPPENING HERE.\nBUT THERE HAVE BEEN ISSUES BEFORE OF TRYING TO GET\nINFORMATION FROM PEOPLE AROUND CLINTON ABOUT HER HEALTH AND NOT\nALWAYS BEING MET PROMPTLY WITH IT.\nSO WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS, IF IT'S JUST PNEUMONIA, THERE ISN'T\nA REASON TO NOT REALLY JUST SAY UPFRONT, ESPECIALLY WHEN WHAT\nHER POINT IS CORRECT, YOU KNOW, SHE IS WORKING THROUGH THIS.\nWE'VE HAD -- ONE OF THE RULES OF A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN IS\nEVERYBODY GETS SICK. YOU ARE ON THESE PLANES, YOU ARE\nIN THESE BUBBLES. EVERYBODY GETS SICK.\nIT'S UNDERSTANDABLE. BUT IT'S HARDER TO SAY AFTER THE\nFACT, LOOK, SHE'S POWERING THROUGH THIS, WHEN THEY HAVE\nSORT OF MINIMIZED IT OVER MANY, MANY HOURS.\nIT WASN'T JUST 90 MINUTES. THE PNEUMONIA PIECE DIDN'T COME\nOUT UNTIL THE AFTERNOON. >> THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO WALK\nTHIS LINE BETWEEN FEEDING THESE CONSPIRACY THEORIES THAT ARE OUT\nTHERE AND PROVIDING MORE INFORMATION.\nBY ERRING ON THE SIDE OF NOT WANTING TO FEED THE CONSPIRACY\nTHEORIES THEY'VE MADE IT WORSE. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO\nACKNOWLEDGE, LOOK, WE DIDN'T DO THAT RIGHT BECAUSE THEY WERE\nAFRAID OF FEEDING THAT BEAST.

THIS IS NOT A BOTH SIDES ISSUE.\nCLINTON'S CAMPAIGN IS MUCH MORE OPEN ON THIS IN TERMS OF THE\nPRESS. THEY BASICALLY HAVE A FULL\nPROTECTIVE POOL. NOT TOTALLY.\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN DOES NOT. THEY ARE TRYING TO WORK ON\nEXPANDING SOME OF THESE THINGS, BUT THEY ARE NOT THERE.\nTHIS IS A CAMPAIGN THAT HAD UNTIL RECENTLY BANNED NEWS\nOUTLETS. >> RIGHT.\nTHE \"WASHINGTON POST.\" >> INCLUDING THE \"WASHINGTON\nPOST.\" THIS SHOULD NOT BE TREATED LIKE\nIT'S ALL ON A CURVE WITH THIS.

I TALKED TO HER EARLIER THIS\nEVENING. SHE FELT DIZZY, LOST HER BALANCE\nFOR A MOMENT. HER DOCTOR RELEASED A STATEMENT\nSAYING CLINTON HAD BECOME DEHYDRATED.\nTODAY THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN SAID THEY'D RELEASE MORE MEDICAL\nINFORMATION ABOUT CLINTON IN THE NEXT DAYS.\nCHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT DR. SANJAY GUPTA REPORTS.\n>> Reporter: SHE DOESN'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IT BUT HILLARY\nCLINTON'S HEALTH HISTORY HAS BEEN UNDER SCRUTINY EVER SINCE\nSHE WAS FIRST LADY IN THE 1990s.\nIN 1998, SHE EXPERIENCED A DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS, A BLOOD CLOT IN\nHER RIGHT LEG. AT THE TIME, SHE DESCRIBED THE\nEXPERIENCE AS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT HEALTH SCARE SHE HAS\nEVER HAD. THE BIG CONCERN, BLOOD CLOTS,\nWHILE TREATABLE, CAN LEAD TO COMPLICATIONS, EVEN DEATH IF THE\nCLOT MOVES INTO THE LUNGS OR THE HEART.\nIN 2009, SHE HAD ANOTHER BLOOD CLOT, THE LOCATION STILL\nUNKNOWN, AND WAS NOT MADE PUBLIC UNTIL SHE LAUNCHED HER MOST\nRECENT BID FOR THE NOMINATION. CLINTON HAS BEEN ON BLOOD\nTHINNERS EVER SINCE. THAT SAME YEAR WELL EN ROUTE TO\nMEET WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA, CLINTON SLIPPED IN THE BASEMENT\nOF THE STATE DEPARTMENT FRACTURING HER RIGHT ELBOW AND\nREQUIRING SURGERY, BUT IT WAS A CONCUSSION IN DECEMBER 2012\nWHICH CLINTON SUSTAINED WHILE BATTLING A STOMACH VIRUS,\nFAINTING THEN FALLING IN HER HOME THAT CAUSED THE MOST\nCONCERN. PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON SAYING\nAFTER THE FACT HER RECOVERY TOOK SOME TIME.\n>> REQUIRED SIX MONTHS OF VERY SERIOUS WORK TO GET OVER.\n>> Reporter: THE GLASSES SHE WORE AFTER THE CONCUSSION FITTED\nWITH SPECIAL PRISM LENSES TO HELP CORRECT DOUBLE VISION GAVE\nSOME INDICATION AS TO HOW SERIOUS THE CONCUSSION WAS AND A\nSCAN TAKEN RIGHT AFTER THE CONCUSSION REVEALING YET ANOTHER\nBLOOD CLOT. THIS TIME IN BETWEEN HER SKULL\nAND THE BACK OF HER BRAIN. THE BIG CONCERN HERE IS THAT THE\nCLOT COULD PREVENT BLOOD FROM DRAINING PROPERLY FROM THE BRAIN\nCAUSING SWELLING AND POSSIBLY LEADING TO A STROKE.\nFOLLOW-UP EXAMS SUGGESTED NO LONG-TERM BRAIN INJURY AND THE\nCLOT EVENTUALLY DISSOLVED. JUST OVER A YEAR AGO, HER DOCTOR\nRELEASED A HEALTH CARE STATEMENT STATING IN PART THAT SHE'S IN\nEXCELLENT PHYSICAL CONDITION AND FIT TO SERVE AS PRESIDENT OF THE\nUNITED STATES. SHE OPENED UP ABOUT HER HEALTH\nTO ABC'S DIANE SAWYER IN 2014. >> HOW IS YOUR HEALTH?\n>> IT'S VERY GOOD, THANK YOU. >> HOW SERIOUS WAS IT?\n>> IT WAS, YOU KNOW, IT WAS, I THINK, A SERIOUS CONCUSSION.\n>> THE CLOT IN ADDITION -- >> YES.\n>> IF THE CLOT HAD DISLODGED -- >> WELL, CAN I TELL YOU, THAT\nWAS A SCARY POINT. >> YOU HAD TROUBLE WITH VISION.\n>> I HAD -- BECAUSE OF THE FORCE OF THE FALL, I HAD SOME -- I HAD\nDOUBLE VISION FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND I HAD SOME\nDIZZINESS. >> DID YOU HAVE TROUBLE TALKING?\n>> NO.

IF SHE DID DO THAT, THEN THE DNC\nCHAIR NOW DONNA BRAZIL WOULD CALL A SPECIAL MEETING TO SELECT\nA NOMINEE WITH A MAJORITY VOTE OF ATTENDEES AT THAT MEETING,\nTHE DNC DOES NOT HAVE TO RECONVENE THE CONVENTION.\nSO TIM KAINE WOULD NOT AUTOMATICALLY BECOME THE\nPRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE.

EARLY VOTING ALREADY STARTED IN\nNORTH CAROLINA AND WILL START IN ALABAMA LATER THIS WEEK.\nMILITARY AND OVERSEAS VOTES ARE MAILED 45 DAYS BEFORE THE\nELECTION. THAT'S TEN DAYS FROM NOW.\nAND OBVIOUSLY THE STATE BALLOTS ARE CLOSE TO GETTING A NEW NAME\nON THE BALLOT. SO IT WOULD BE A LOGISTICAL\nNIGHTMARE FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.\n>> DO THEY HAVE EITHER PARTY A PROCEDURE IN PLACE IF THE MAIN\nCANDIDATE FALLS ILL? WE CERTAINLY HAVE HEARD OF\nPRESIDENTS FALLEN WITH SECONDS OF TAKING OFFICE.\nA COUPLE NAMES COME TO MIND, EITHER WITH A LONG SPEECH,\nWITHOUT AN OVERCOAT, I DIGRESS TO MAKE THE POINT WE HAVE SEEN\nTHIS EARLY ON IN THE ADMINISTRATION, BUT I DON'T\nTHINK WE'RE PREPARED AS A COUNTRY OR THE PARTY IS FOR THE\nPOSSIBILITY THAT THEIR NOMINEE BECOMES A BIG HEALTH QUESTION\nMARK. >> EXACTLY.\nTHAT'S WHY YOU SAW FORMER DNC CHAIR DAN FOULER SAYING WE NEED\nTO HAMMER THIS OUT NOW ON THE VERY REMOTE POSSIBILITY\nSOMETHING DOES HAPPEN TO HILLARY CLINTON.\nWE DON'T WANT TO BE LEFT WITH NO OPTIONS AND JUST CEDING THE\nPRESIDENCY TO DONALD TRUMP.

THIS IS A DARK, PESSIMISTIC\nVISION OF A COUNTRY WHERE WE TURN AGAINST EACH OTHER.\nWE TURN AWAY FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD.\nTHEY'RE NOT OFFERING SERIOUS SOLUTIONS.\nTHEY'RE JUST FANNING RESENTMENT AND FLAME AND ANGER AND HATE.\nAND THAT IS NOT THE AMERICA WE KNOW.\nTHAT'S NOT THE AMERICA I KNOW. >> NOW, WE'VE HEARD, DON, FROM\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE SOME OF THE\nDISCOURSE A LITTLE BIT MORE POSITIVE, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE\nLATEST AD THE CAMPAIGN HAS CALLED \"LOW OPINIONS,\" IT\nFEATURES DONALD TRUMP'S NEGATIVE REMARKS ABOUT A NUMBER OF\nDIFFERENT PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT GROUPS SO YOU'RE SEEING PERHAPS\nTHAT'S EASIER SAID THAN DONE. >> BRIANA PRESIDENT OBAMA IS\nVERY POPULAR RIGHT NOW. HIS APPROVAL RATING IS 58% IN\nTHE LATEST ABC POLL. HOW MUCH WILL COME TOWARDS HIM\nSUPPORTING HILLARY CLINTON? >> WE WERE TOLD HE WAS WATCHING\nTHOSE REMARKS AND HILLARY CLINTON HAS MADE HER CAMPAIGN\nABOUT TRYING TO BRING TOGETHER THAT BARACK OBAMA COALITION THAT\nHELPED PROPEL HIM TO THE WHITE HOUSE IN 2008 OVER HER OF COURSE\nIN THE PRIMARIES AND IN 2012. WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THOUGH IS\nSHE'S UNDERPERFORMING WITH SOME KEY GROUPS IN THAT COALITION,\nNAMELY HISPANICS AND YOUNG PEOPLE.\nNOW YOU TALK TO THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN AND THEY'LL SAY SHE'S\nDOING OKAY WITH MILLENNIAL. THE ISSUE IS HOW ENTHUSIASTIC\nARE THEY? ARE THEY ENTH ENTHUSIASTIC ENOU\nTHAT PROPELLED HIM INTO THE NOMINATION AND THE WHITE HOUSE,\nWE JUST DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT IF THAT'S GOING TO WORK.\n>> YOU TOOK THE WORDS RIGHT OUT OF MY MOUTH, THANK YOU VERY\nMUCH, AND THAT'S ALL I'M GOING TO GET.\nTHANK YOU. I'M GOING TO BRING IN MARK AND\nGLORIA. LISTENING TO THE PRESIDENT\nTODAY, TALKING ABOUT THAT ENTHUSIASM GAP HILLARY HAS, THE\nQUESTION IS WHY DIDN'T THEY GET THE PRESIDENT OUT EARLIER.\nLET'S LISTEN A BIT AND THEN WE'LL DISCUSS.\n>> YOU WANT TO DEBATE WHO'S MORE FIT TO BE OUR PRESIDENT?\nONE CANDIDATE WHOSE TRAVELED TO MORE COUNTRIES THAN ANY\nSECRETARY OF STATE EVER HAS, HAS MORE QUALIFICATIONS THAN PRETTY\nMUCH ANYONE WHO'S EVER RUN FOR THIS JOB, AND THE OTHER WHO\nISN'T FIT IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM, TO REPRESENT THIS COUNTRY\nABROAD AND BE ITS COMMANDER IN CHIEF.\n>> IS SHE HER SINGLE BEST ASSET FOR CAMPAIGN SOMETHING.\n>> SHE'S GOT MANY GREAT SURROGATES FOR HER, BUT, YEAH,\nOF COURSE. THE QUESTION THAT I THINK WE ALL\nHAVE IS JUST HOW TRANSFERRABLE IS AN INCUMBENT PRESIDENT'S\nPOPULARITY, AND HE IS POPULARITY.\nTHERE IS NO AMBIGUITY ABOUT THE FACT HE WANTS HER.\nTHEY ARE ON THE SAME PAGE. WHAT HE HAS TO DO NOW IS MAKE IT\nCLEAR TO PEOPLE WHO ARE TRULY AND DEEPLY LOYAL TO HIM, THAT\nHIS LEGACY IS AT STAKE HERE WITH HILLARY CLINTON.\nHE HAS TO GET THEM ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT GOING TO THE POLLS.\nTHIS IS ABOUT MOBILIZATION NOW, IT'S NOT ABOUT PERSUASION\nANYMORE. GET YOUR VOTERS OUT THERE AND\nTHAT'S THE BIGGEST THING PRESIDENT OBAMA CAN DO FOR\nHILLARY CLINTON IS TELL PEOPLE THE STEAKS AKES OF THIS ELECTIO\nSAY DO YOU WANT MY LEGACY TO CONTINUE OR WANT IT UNDONE?\n>> NOT JUST GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS HERE, REALLY, REALLY,\nREALLY, WANT TO GET HER ELECTED. THIS MEANS A LOT TO HIM.\nHE MOCKED DONALD TRUMP'S APPEAL TO WORKING-CLASS PEOPLE AND GO\nTO DONALD TRUMP ABOUT NOT RELEASING HIS TAX RETURNS, MARK,\nLISTEN. >> YOU WANT TO DEBATE\nTRANSPARENTLY. YOU'VE GOT ONE CANDIDATE IN THIS\nRACE WHOSE RELEASED DECADES WORTH OF HER TAX RETURNS.\nTHE OTHER CANDIDATE IS THE FIRST IN DECADES WHO REFUSES TO\nRELEASE ANY AT ALL. YOU WANT TO DEBATE FOUNDATIONS\nAND CHARITIES? ONE CANDIDATE'S FAMILY\nFOUNDATION HAS SAVED COUNTLESS LIVES AROUND THE WORLD.\nTHE OTHER CANDIDATE'S FOUNDATION TOOK MONEY OTHER PEOPLE GAVE TO\nHIS CHARITY AND THEN BOUGHT A SIX FOOT TALL PAINTING OF\nHIMSELF. >> SO PENNSYLVANIA A KEY\nBATTLEGROUND STATE. WHY IS HE THERE?\n>> DEMOCRATS HAVE WON PENNSYLVANIA SINCE GEORGE H.B.\nBUSH, BUT BARACK OBAMA WON BY TEN POINTS IN 2008.\n2012 HER ONLY WON BY FIVE POINTS AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE MAP,\nALMOST EVERY COUNTY IN PENNSYLVANIA WENT REPUBLICAN\nEXPECT PHILADELPHIA AND THE COUNTIES SURROUNDING THAT AND\nTHEN ALLEGHENY COUNTY RIGHT OUT IN PITTSBURGH.\nWE SAW FROM BARACK OBAMA TODAY OUT IN PHILADELPHIA WAS AS\nGLORIA SAID, MOBILIZING AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS AND\nTRYING TO TALK TO BLUE COLLAR VOTERS AND THIS IS REALLY\nIMPORTANT. THESE ARE VOTERS LIVING IN OHIO,\nAND MICHIGAN AND PENNSYLVANIA, AS WELL AND THESE ARE STATES\nTHAT HAVE LARGE AFRICAN-AMERICAN POPULATIONS, AS WELL, SO WHEN\nBARACK OBAMA DOES ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, I WAS TOLD BY A\nWHITE HOUSE ADVISOR DON'T EXPECT HIM IN THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS, HE\nHAS THE U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY COMING IN THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS\nBUT COME OCTOBER, EXPECT HIM ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND THESE ARE\nSTATES WHERE BARACK OBAMA COULD TRY TO HELP PERSUADE\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS NOT THE PERCENTAGE OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nVOTERS HILLARY CLINTON IS GOING TO GET, BUT THE NUMBER OF AFTER\nCONDITION AM AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS.\n>> I CAN JUST ADD I THINK IT'S PERSONAL FOR THE PRESIDENT.\n>> RIGHT. >> AND THIS IS THE MAN WHO\nDONALD TRUMP WAS THE ORIGINAL BERTHER, OKAY.\nAND I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS PERSONAL TO HIM AND HE HAS COME\nTO RESPECT HILLARY CLINTON. SHE WAS HIS SECRETARY OF STATE,\nAND ALSO WHEN HE SAID TODAY, HE'S JUST NOT QUALIFIED TO BE\nPRESIDENT, I THINK IT'S PERSONAL TO HIM IN THAT SENSE, TOO, WHICH\nIS, WAIT A MINUTE, THIS IS A REALLY ELITE CLUB OF PEOPLE WHO\nBECOME PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES AND IT WAS ALMOST AS IF\nHE WAS OFFENDED. >> YEAH.\n>> THAT SOMEONE WOULD THINK THAT -- THAT OF THE TWO PEOPLE\nIN THIS RACE THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS MORE QUALIFIED THAN HIM.\nNOW, OBVIOUSLY HE'S PARTISAN. WE GET THAT, BUT I REALLY GOT A\nPERSONAL SENSE ABOUT IT TODAY. >> ESPECIALLY AS HE SAID, I'VE\nHEARD THAT HE -- YOU KNOW WORKING-CLASS AMERICANS ARE\nDRAWN TO DONALD TRUMP. IS THAT A JOKE, THIS GUY, IN HIS\nESTIMATION, THE BANKRUPTCIES AND HAS USED PEOPLE IN HIS BUSINESS,\nWOULDN'T ALLOW YOU ON HIS GOLF COURSES.\n>> EXACTLY. >> IT IS PERSONAL, AS I WAS\nWATCHING, THIS IS VERY PERSONAL. WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO TALK\nABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE RIGHT AFTER THIS.\nDON'T GO ANYWHERE.",

[ APPLAUSE ]\nSO SOMEHOW AS THINGS GO ON BECAUSE WE'VE BECOME SO\nPARTISAN, OUR STANDARDS FOR WHAT'S NORMAL HAVE CHANGED.\nAND DONALD TRUMP SAYS STUFF EVERYDAY THAT USED TO BE\nCONSIDERED AS DISQUALIFYING FOR BEING PRESIDENT.\nAND YET BECAUSE HE SAYS IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN THE\nPRESS JUST GIVES UP AND THEY JUST SAY, WELL, YEAH.\nOKAY. \"I WAS OPPOSED TO THE WAR IN\nIRAQ.\" WELL, ACTUALLY, HE WASN'T.\nBUT THEY JUST ACCEPT IT. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WE CAN\nNOT AFFORD SUDDENLY TO TREAT THIS LIKE A REALITY SHOW.\nWE CAN'T AFFORD TO ACT AS IF THERE'S SOME EQUIVALENCE HERE.\nTO BE PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE TO DO YOUR HOME WORK AND YOU HAVE TO\nKNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AND YOU'VE GOT APPLY STUDY\nJUDGMENT EVEN WHEN THINGS DON'T GO YOUR WAY AND YOU'VE GOT TO\nMAKE THE TOUGH CALLS EVEN WHEN THEY'RE NOT POPULAR.\nEVEN WHEN THEY TAKE YEARS TO PAY OFF AND YOU HAVE TO HANDLE\nCRITICISM WITHOUT TAKING IT PERSONALLY, JUST BRUSHING IT\nOFF. AND THEN GO AHEAD AND GET THE\nJOB DONE. AND THAT'S SOMETHING I LEARNED.\nAND THAT'S WHAT HILLARY LEARNED AS A SENATOR AND SECRETARY OF\nSTATE AND FIRST LADY. YES SHE'S GOT HER SHARE OF\nCRITICS LIKE I DO AND SHE'S BEEN CARICATURED BY THE RIGHT AND\nSOMETIMES BY THE LEFT AND SHE'S BEEN ACCUSED OF EVERYTHING YOU\nCAN IMAGINE AND HAS BEEN SUBJECTED TO MORE SCRUTINY AND\nWHAT I BELIEVE IS MORE UNFAIR CRITICISM THAN ANYBODY OUT HERE\nAND SHE DOESN'T COMPLAIN ABOUT IT.\nAND YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE\nUNDER THE MICROSCOPE FOR 40 YEARS.\nBUT WHAT SETS HILLARY APART IS THROUGH IT ALL SHE KEEPS GOING\nAND SHE DOESN'T STOP CARING AND SHE DOESN'T STOP TRYING AND SHE\nNEVER STOPS FIGHTING FOR US EVEN IF WE HAVEN'T ALWAYS APPRECIATED\nHER. WE ARE A YOUNG COUNTRY, WE ARE A\nRESTLESS COUNTRY.

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]\n>> PRESIDENT OBAMA, THIS IS SIGNIFICANT.\nTHIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE SEEN HIM AS A SOLO APPEARANCE\nSTUMPING FOR HILLARY CLINTON. HE WANTS TO, AS HE JUST SAID,\nPASS THE BATON ON, THERE HE IS IN PHILADELPHIA.\nREALLY ECHOES OF THEN SENATOR OBAMA RUNNING FOR REELECTION IN\n2012 HEARING THINGS LIKE \"DON'T BOO, VOTE.\"\n\"FIRED UP READY TO GO.\" THE CROWD CHANTING \"YES WE CAN.\"\nTRYING TO FIRE UP THE ELECTORATE.\nTELLING THEM WHY THE MAN WHO, ODDLY ENOUGH, WE'VE BEEN\nWATCHING IN THE LITTLE BOX ON THE SCREEN SPEAKING AT THE SAME\nTIME, DONALD TRUMP, WHY HE THINKS HE IS NOT THE MAN TO BE\nTHE NEXT COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF HE ALSO CRITICIZED THE GUYS IN THE\nBACK, THE PRESS. LET'S GET INTO ALL OF THAT.\nI HAVE SUSAN PAGE WITH ME, THE WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF FOR \"USA\nTODAY\" NOW COVERING HER NINTH PRESIDENTIAL RACE.\nWE'LL STAY ON THESE PICTURES. CNN SENIOR POLITICAL REPORTER\nNIA-MALIKA HENDERSON. CRISCO ADVANTAGE WHO SUPPORTS\nDONALD TRUMP. HILARY ROSEN A, A DEMOCRATIC\nSTRATEGIST WHO SUPPORTS HILLARY CLINTON AND WITH ME HERE ON SET\nWHO COVERED OBAMA THE LAST COUPLE OF ROUNDS JEFF ZELENY.\nSUSAN PAGE, I DEFER TO YOU AS YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH AS WE\nMENTIONED, WHAT, NINE ELECTIONS AND LISTENING TO PRESIDENT ON\nHIS TALK OF TRANSPARENCY, OF A DOUBLE STANDARD, WHAT JUMPED OUT\nAT YOU? >> I'VE COVERED NINE, THIS IS MY\nTENTH. NEVER IN THOSE CAMPAIGNS HAVE\nYOU HAD AN INCUMBENT PRESIDENT CAMPAIGN WITH THAT KIND OF\nENTHUSIASM FOR HIS PARTY'S NOMINEE TO SUCCEED.\nFOR VARIOUS REASONS AL GORE DIDN'T WANT BILL CLINTON OUT\nTHERE. JOHN McCAIN DID NOT WANT GEORGE\nW. BUSH OUT THERE. THIS IS A CASE WHERE BARACK\nOBAMA ALIGNS WITH HILLARY CLINTON'S POSITION.\nHE WANTS YOUNGER VOTERS AND AFRICAN-AMERICANS TO TURN OUT IN\nSIGNIFICANT NUMBERS. YOU SAW HIS POWER TO DO THAT IN\nTHAT RALLY WE JUST WATCHED IN PHILADELPHIA.\n>> NIA, WHAT DID YOU ANY WHY IS HE IN PHILADELPHIA, TOO?\n>> PHILADELPHIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN GOOD TO DEMOCRATS.\nYOU THINK ABOUT 2008, BARACK OBAMA DREW 35,000 FOLKS THERE IN\n2004 JOHN KERRY WAS THERE WITH BILL CLINTON, DREW A CROWD OF\nLIKE 100,000. IT'S THE CENTER OF THAT\nPENNSYLVANIA GETOUT-THE-VOTE MACHINE FOR DEMOCRATS AND\nDEMOCRATS NEED TO WIN PENNSYLVANIA THIS GO ROUND IF\nTHEY'RE TO CONTINUE OBAMA'S LEGACY AND HAVE HILLARY CLINTON\nTAKE THE WHITE HOUSE. HE WAS FEELING IT OUT THERE.\nTHIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO HAS A 58% APPROVAL RATING ACCORDING TO\nTHIS \"WASHINGTON POST\" POLL THAT CAME OUT JUST RECENTLY.\nAND I THOUGHT HE VERY EFFECTIVELY PICKED APART SOME OF\nDONALD TRUMP'S ARGUMENTS. HE WAS MOCKING HIM.\nHE TALKED ABOUT THE BIZARRENESS, HE FRAMED IT THAT WAY, OF DONALD\nTRUMP SEEING PUTIN AS A ROLE MODEL.\nHE TALKED ABOUT THIS IDEA OF DONALD TRUMP BEING A CHAMPION OF\nWORKING CLASS. AMERICANS, BUT YET SOMEONE WHO\nWOULDN'T LET WORKING CLASS AMERICANS IN HIS BUILDINGS OR\nSOMEONE WHO WOULDN'T LET WORKING CLASS AMERICANS ON TO HIS GOLF\nCOURSES. I THOUGHT HE WAS SO EFFECTIVE\nHERE IN THIS CROWD TODAY AND I AM SURE THE HILLARY CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN IS PLEASED AND WANTS TO SEE HIM OUT THERE MORE AND MORE\nAND IN OCTOBER HE WILL BE OUT THERE MUCH MORE.\n>> HIS LINE -- HE WAS SORT OF ON A ROLL GETTING THE CROWD TO\nLAUGH, TALKING ABOUT -- WHEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT VLADIMIR PUTIN\nAS A ROLE MODEL AND TALKING ABOUT SADDAM HUSSEIN AND SAYING,\nLISTEN, IF YOU JAIL DISSIDENTS AND YOU CONTROL THE MEDIA, YOU'D\nHAVE A 90% APPROVAL RATING, TOO. CHRIS KOVAC, TO YOU.\nWE HEARD ABOUT THIS TRANSPARENCY WHEN HILLARY CLINTON WAS ON THE\nPHONE WITH ANDERSON COOPER, WE HEARD IT WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA,\nTHIS LACK OF TRANSPARENCY WHEN IT COMES TO YOUR CANDIDATE.\nDO YOU AGREE WITH THAT? WE JUST DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP. >> WELL, I MEAN, I THINK THAT'S\nA HARD CHARGE FOR THE HILLARY CAMPAIGN AND BY EXTENSION\nPRESIDENT OBAMA TO MAKE, TOO, BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL OF THE\nDESTROYED E-MAILS ON HILLARY'S PART AND THE LACK OF\nTRANSPARENCY -- >> TAX RETURNS, MEDICAL RECORDS,\nTWO EXAMPLES THEY WOULD THROW BACK AT YOU.\n>> RIGHT, BUT I'M SAYING -- RIGHT, EXACTLY.\nTHERE'S NO QUESTION TRUMP HAS SAID YOU WILL SEE THE TAX\nRETURNS AFTER THE AUDIT IS DONE. I'M SURE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WILL\nBE HAPPY TO PUT OUT MEDICAL RECORDS IN LIGHT OF THE RECENT\nDIFFICULTIES WITH .\nI DON'T THINK THERE WILL BE A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY THERE.\nI'LL SAY THIS ABOUT OBAMA -- >> HANG ON.\nWHEN YOU BRING UP THE MEDICAL RECORDS.\nDO WE KNOW HOW FAR BACK, HOW DETAILED THE TRUMP MEDICAL\nRECORDS WILL BE WHEN THEY'RE RELEASED THIS WEEK?\n>> I DON'T KNOW HOW FAR. I HAVEN'T GOTTEN ANY INFORMATION\nON THAT. BUT I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IN\nTHEY'RE PRETTY SIGNIFICANT. LET ME SAY THIS.\nI THINK HAVING OBAMA SPEAK ON BEHALF OF HILLARY WAS A SMART\nMOVE BECAUSE ONE OF THE MAIN PROBLEMS WE'VE SEEN IN THIS\nENTIRE CAMPAIGN YEAR FOR THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS AN\nENTHUSIASM GAP. REMEMBER IN THE REPUBLICAN\nPRIMARIES TRUMP BROUGHT ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE OUT OF THE\nWOODWORK AND HAD HUGE RECORD-SETTING NUMBERS.\nON THE DEMOCRAT SIDE YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT.\nSO OBAMA HAS THE ABILITY TO MOTIVATE PEOPLE AND GET THEM\nEXCITED FOR HILLARY, THE BASE, THAT IS, PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY\nTHINKING ABOUT VOTING FOR HILLARY BUT IT'S A DOUBLE-EDGED\nSWORTD BECAUSE IT REINFORCES HILLARY WILL BE A THIRD OBAMA\nTERM AND I DON'T THINK THEY'RE RUNNING AWAY FROM THAT ANYMORE\nIN THE HILLARY CAMPAIGN AND THAT PLAYS INTO TRUMP'S ARGUMENT\nTHAT, LOOK, I CAN BLAME THE WAGE STAGNATION ON HILLARY, I CAN\nBLAME THE POOR ECONOMY, OUR WEAKNESS ABROAD ON HILLARY\nBECAUSE SHE'S EMBRACING THE IDEA THAT SHE WILL BE THE THIRD OBAMA\nTERM. SO IT HAS A NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCE\nFOR THE CAMPAIGN. >> I THINK ON ECONOMICS, HE\nBROUGHT UP THE NEW NUMBERS WITH REGARD TO THE MEDIAN INCOME\nGOING UP TO $56,000. HIS LINE WAS REPUBLICANS DON'T\nLIKE TO HEAR GOOD NEWS RIGHT NOW.\nSO HILARY ROSEN, I WANT YOU TO RESPOND TO THAT BUT I WANT YOU\nTO RESPOND TO OBAMA'S POINT WHEN HE WAS SAYING HILLARY CLINTON IS\nSUBJECTED TO MORE SCRUTINY, MORE CRITICISM, THAT THERE IS A\nDOUBLE STANDARD. >> AND LET'S REMEMBER THAT\nPRESIDENT OBAMA HAS A MAJORITY APPROVAL RATING IN THIS COUNTRY,\nMUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT SO IF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WILL TRY TO HANG\nHIM AROUND HILLARY'S NECK THEY'LL BE SURPRISED BECAUSE\nHE'S QUITE POPULAR, PARTICULARLY IN THE STATES DONALD TRUMP HAS\nTO WIN TO OVERCOME HER LEAD. I THINK WE GET TO THIS POINT NOW\nIN THE RACE WHERE HILLARY CLINTON IS GOING TO BE MORE\nPROACTIVE, MORE POSITIVE ABOUT THE CHANGES SHE'S GOING TO MAKE\nIN THIS COUNTRY AND I THOUGHT PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS VERY\nARTICULATE IN SAYING ESSENTIALLY LOOK AT DONALD TRUMP'S RECORD.\nHE'S CHEATED PEOPLE, HIS FOUNDATION DIDN'T JUST TAKE\nOTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY BUT IT BOUGHT A SIX-FOOT-TALL PAINTING\nOF HIMSELF. THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF GIEP\nWHO'S GOING TO COME UP WITH POLICIES TO HELP YOU, THE\nMIDDLE-CLASS, IN PENNSYLVANIA. >> ON THE ENTHUSIASM POINT,\nTHOUGH, LET ME BOUNCE BACK WHEN KRIS MENTIONED THAT, THAT'S A\nVALID CRITICISM OF HILLARY CLINTON THUS FAR, ESPECIALLY\nAMONG SOME YOUNG FOLKS. JEFF ZELENY, YOU SAW PRESIDENT\nOBAMA, YOU COVERED HIM, YOU WERE SHOWING ME A PICTURE IN '08 AND\nYOU REMEMBER THESE SIMILAR CHORUSES WHICH BROUGHT ABOUT\nENTHUSIASM, ESPECIALLY FROM YOUNG PEOPLE \"YES, WE CAN.\"\n>> WITHOUT A DOUBT. HE'S HOPING THE RESPONSE IS THE\nSAME. YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THERE ARE\nSO MANY MILLENNIALS WHO DIDN'T GET THE CHANCE TO VOTE FOR HIM\nSO HE'S OFFERING THEM A CHANCE TO VOTE FOR THIS THIRD TERM.\nI COULD NOT V IMAGINED SITTING HERE A YEAR OR SO AGO THINKING\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN WOULD HAVE BEEN OKAY RUNNING FOR A THIRD\nOBAMA TERM. AND NOW THEY ARE BECAUSE OF THE\nECONOMIC NUMBERS AND OTHER THINGS AND BECAUSE HE'S SO\nDIFFERENT THAN MR. TRUMP. BUT WHAT'S STRIKING HERE IS\nWE'VE NEVER SEEN IF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S TRANSLATES TO OTHER\nCANDIDATES BEFORE. IT DIDN'T IN 2010 WHEN HE LOST\nCONTROL OF THE SENATE. IT CERTAINLY DIDN'T IF 2014.\nTHIS IS A BIGGEST TEST, I THINK, OF HIS TRANSFERABILITY HERE.\nCAN SOME OF THOSE VOTERS -- WILL THEY FOLLOW HIM AND JOIN HIM?\nHE DOESN'T NEED TO GET EVERYONE, HE JUST NEEDS TO GET THAT OLD\nBAND BACK TOGETHER, THE OBAMA COALITION OF VOTERS.\nTHOO'S WHY HE'S IN PHILLY REGISTERING PEOPLE TO VOTE.\nTHAT'S WHY HE'S HERE AND MICHELLE OBAMA IS IN VIRGINIA ON\nFRIDAY. HE'S THE MOST VALUABLE PLAYER IN\nTHIS CAMPAIGN BUT IT'S A BIG TEST FOR HIM AND HIS LEGACY AS\nWELL. >> JUST ONE QUICK THING ON THE\nENTHUSIASM GAPS WHICH THAT, YOU KNOW, NO ONE, MILLENNIALS OR\nSENIOR CITIZENS, COULD BE WATCHING THIS CAMPAIGN AND JUST\nFEEL GOOD ABOUT IT. THIS IS NOT A CAMPAIGN THAT'S\nTALKING ABOUT DIRECTLY ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY.\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS TO DO EVERYTHING SHE CAN TO MAKE IT BE\nABOUT THAT BUT THIS HAS BEEN FOR THE LAST 15 MONTHS ON THE\nREPUBLICAN SIDE AND WE'VE NOW BROUGHT IT INTO THE GENERAL A\nCAMPAIGN OF INSULTS, OF RACE BAITING, OF RELIGION BAITING.\nIT'S JUST AN UNPLEASANT THING TO EXPERIENCE, I KNOW FOR THOSE OF\nUS SITTING AROUND THAT STUDIO AND SO I CAN ONLY IMAGINE IN SO\nMANY WAYS HOW IT FEELS TO PEOPLE WHO REALLY WANT PROGRESS IN THIS\nCOUNTRY, WHO WANT TO BUILD ON THE PROGRESS OF THIS COUNTRY.\n>> ON PROGRESS, JUST QUICKLY, WE HEARD AND MENTIONED A MOMENT AGO\nHOW OBVIOUSLY PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS TOUTING THE POSITIVE\nECONOMIC NUMBERS TODAY. AS WE WERE LISTENING TO THE\nPRESIDENT, DONALD TRUMP WAS SPEAKING AS WELL.\nHE JUST SPOKE ABOUT THE ECONOMY, LET'S HEAR WHAT HE SAID.\n>> ONE IN FIVE AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS DO NOT HAVE A SINGLE\nHELP IN THE LABOR FORCE. ANOTHER 14 MILLION PEOPLE LEFT\nTHE LABOR FORCE SINCE 2009 AND THE NATIONAL DEBT HAS DOUBLED TO\nNEARLY $20 TRILLION DURING THE OBAMA YEARS.\n>> SO, ALL RIGHT, SUSAN PAGE, COMING TO YOU ON YOUR 10th\nPRESIDENTIAL ELECTION YOU'RE COVERING.\nHERE'S MORE NUMBERS JUST TO CONFUSE EVERYONE BUT IT'S\nSIGNIFICANT. THIS IS THE NEWS THAT CAME OUT\nTODAY. THIS IS FROM THE U.S. CENSUS\nBUREAU. MEDIAN INCOME IN THE U.S. GREW\nTO $56,516, THAT REPRESENTS A 5.2% RAISE FOR AMERICAN WORKERS,\nTHE FIRST GAIN SINCE 2007, ADDITIONALLY THE POVERTY RATE\nALSO DECLINED, ALL OBVIOUSLY POSITIVE NEWS, WE HEARD THE\nPRESIDENT OUT THING  TOUTING TH HE SAID YES IT TOOK TIME FOR\nCHANGE. HOW DO YOU HEAR TRUMP JUXTAPOSED\nWITH THE POSITIVE NEWS TODAY? >> THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT\nSTATISTICS FOR THE DEMOCRATS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE\nUNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS GONE DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY, DOWN BELOW 5%,\nCUT IN HALF DURING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S TENURE BUT THE STAG\nSTATION OF WAGES HAS BEEN A BIG PROBLEM FOR AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS,\nTHIS MEANS MORE AMERICANS CAN FEEL THE ECONOMY IS REALLY IN\nTHAT RECOVERY THAT WE'VE TECHNICALLY BEEN IN FOR SOME\nTIME BUT WHICH A LOT OF PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES AND\nHOUSEHOLDS HAVEN'T FELT. DEFINITELY IMPORTANT STATISTIC.\nBUT YOU SEE TWO DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF AMERICA FROM THESE\nTWO CAMPAIGNS AND WE SAW THAT IN THE TWO CONVENTIONS IN JULY, A\nMUCH MORE UPBEAT VERSION OF WHERE THE COUNTRY IS HEADED\nAMONG CLINTON SUPPORTERS AND DEMOCRATS THAN TRUMP SUPPORTERS.\nWE FOUND IN OUR LATEST POLL THAT ABOUT 6 IN 10 CLINTON SUPPORTERS\nTHINK THE COUNTRY IS HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.\n90% OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS THINK THE NATION IS HEADED IN THE\nWRONG DIRECTION. THIS MAY BE THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL\nDIVIDE BETWEEN THESE TWO CAMPAIGNS.\nKRIS KOBACH, I WANT TO PLAY THIS SOUND.\nTHIS IS FROM TRUMP TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMY, TALKING ABOUT THE\nDIFFERENT PARTIES. THIS IS FROM 2004.\n>> IT JUST SEEMS THAT THE ECONOMY DOES BETTER UNDER THE\nDEMOCRATS THAN THE REPUBLICANS. NOW IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT WAY BUT\nIF YOU GO BACK, IT JUST SEEMS THE ECONOMY DOES BETTER UNDER\nTHE DEMOCRATS BUT WE'VE HAD SOME PRETTY BAD DISASTER UNDER THE\nREPU REPUBLICANS.\n>> IT JUST SEEMS THE ECONOMY DOES BETTER UNDER THE DEMOCRATS.\nTHIS IS SOMETHING THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN GRABBED ON TO WHEN THEY\nTWEETED OUT TODAY, KRIS. >> IT IS INTERESTING.\nIF YOU LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC EBBS AND FLOWS, THE UPS AND DOWNS OF\nGDP, SOMETIMES A DEMOCRAT IS IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND SOMETIMES A\nREPUBLICAN IS BUT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME PERIODS WHEN DEMOCRATS\nHAVE BEEN IN THE WHITE HOUSE BUT I THINK WE HAVE THIS PROBABLY\nFALSE CONCEIT IN AMERICA THAT WHOEVER IS PRESIDENT HAS THE\nABILITY TO JUST BY THEIR OWN WILL SOMEHOW CHANGE THE ECONOMY,\nWE KNOW THAT IT'S A COMBINATION OF WHAT ARE THE TAX POLICIES\nCOMING OUT OF CONGRESS, WHAT IS THE PRESIDENT DOING?\nSO IT'S A VARIETY OF THINGS. >> BUT TRUMP WASN'T SAYING THAT.\nI HEAR YOU ON THE NUANCE AND THE DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATIONS BUT\nTRUMP IS SPEAKING IN A BIT MORE GENERAL TERMS SAYING IT JUST\nSEEMS THE ECONOMY DOES BETTER UNDER THE DEMOCRATS.\nWE'VE HAD SOME PRETTY BAD DISASTERS UNDER THE REPUBLICANS.\nHIS OWN WORDS. >> I THINK HE WAS PROBABLY\nTALKING ABOUT THE WAY I READ IT, WHEN A DEMOCRAT IS SITTING IN\nTHE WHITE HOUSE BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE THE SECOND TERM OF THE\nCLINTON ADMINISTRATION YOU HAD REPUBLICANS BALANCING THE BUDGET\nIN CONGRESS, CLINTON SIGNING THAT BUDGET AND SO YOU HAD SOME\nGOOD YEARS BUT A LOT OF IT HAD TO DO WITH REPUBLICAN FISCAL\nCONSERVATISM. SO IT'S HARD TO GENERALIZE LIKE\nTHAT. BOTTOM LINE IS TRUMP IS -- GO\nAHEAD. >> GO AHEAD, HILLARY.\n>> I WAS GOING TO SAY MUCH OF IT HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT\nWHEN THE REPUBLICANS WERE IN CHARGE THEY DROVE UP THE\nDEFICITS BY CREATING HUGE TAX CUTS ACROSS THE BOARD.\nCREATING A BIG VACUUM IN THE ECONOMY AND ESSENTIALLY CRASHING\nTHE LABOR FORCE. AND SO THAT IS -- AND THEN, YOU\nKNOW, TRUMP STARTED TO MAKE MORE MONEY WHEN DEMOCRATS CAME INTO\nOFFICE. THAT'S WHAT HE'S SAYING AND YET\nWHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO NOW IS TO SUGGEST THAT IS THOSE SAME\nPOLICIES, THOSE SAME ADVISORS, THOSE SAME ACROSS-THE-BOARD TAX\nCUTS ARE SOMEHOW GOING TO CREATE A DIFFERENT SITUATION FOR THE\nMIDDLE-CLASS VOTER, IT'S NOT TRUE.\n>> I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING, PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS QUESTIONING\nHOW DONALD TRUMP WOULD BE CHAMPIONING WORKING CLASS\nPEOPLE, NIA, TO YOU. QUESTIONING THE APPEAL OF\nWORKING AMERICANS TO MR. TRUMP. SEEMED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT.\n>> I THINK THAT WAS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE LINES IN HIS\nSPEECH TODAY, ESSENTIALLY TAKING ONE OF TRUMP'S ARGUMENTS AND HIS\nSELLING POINT THAT HE ALONE CONDITIONED K DO IT AND HE IS\nTHE VOICE FOR SO MANY VOICELESS AND SAYING WELL, WHAT HAVE YOU\nDONE SO STAR IN THAT REGARD AND I THINK DONALD TRUMP AND HIS\nSUPPORTERS WILL SAY LISTEN, HE'S CREATED X NUMBER OF JOBS AS A\nBUSINESSMAN BUT I DO THINK IT'S FAIR TO LOOK AT THOSE BUSINESS\nPRACTICES, TO SEE IF HE'S INVESTED.\nFOR INSTANCE, HE'S GOING TO DETROIT SAYING HE WANTS TO\nINVEST IN THOSE COMMUNITIES, WELL HE HADN'T DONE THAT ALREADY\nAS A BUSINESS PERSON SO I THINK OBAMA'S TONE, THE KIND OF\nMOCKERY AND THE QUESTIONING I THINK IS A SMART ONE AND I THINK\nEVEN THIS AD THAT YOU SEE TODAY WITH DONALD TRUMP SAYING\nDEMOCRATS DO IT BETTER, HE SOUNDS LIKE BILL CLINTON'S\nSPEECH FROM 2012 AND YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT IF YOU'RE A\nDEMOCRAT YOU'LL MAKE THAT INTO AN AD BECAUSE THERE YOU HAVE\nDONALD TRUMP ARGUING THE DEMOCRATIC POLICIES ARE BETTER\nFOR THE ECONOMY. >> FINAL QUESTION, JEFF ZELENY,\nTO YOU. SHE MENTIONED BILL CLINTON IN\nTERMS OF PEOPLE ON THE TRAIL THIS WEEK BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY\nHILLARY CLINTON IS RECOUPING FROM PNEUMONIA, HER HUSBAND WILL\nBE AT FUND-RAISERS IN BEVERLY HILLS, WHO ARE THE BIG NAMES?\n>> THE BIGGEST NAME IS THE ONE WE SAW RIGHT THERE IN\nPENNSYLVANIA BUT TIM KAINE WAS IN MICHIGAN, CHELSEA CLINTON HAS\nTWO STOPS TODAY IN NORTH CAROLINA SO REALLY THE ENTIRE\nDEMOCRATIC BENCH HAS BEEN OUT THERE AND HILLARY CLINTON HAS\nBEEN UP WITH ADS BUT I THINK THE KEY TAKEAWAY HERE, PRESIDENT\nOBAMA I AM TOLD BY HIS ADVISORS IS SO SERIOUS ABOUT THIS, AND WE\nHEARD HIM SAY HE'S LIKE I AM REALLY, REALLY, REALLY INTO\nELECTING HER. HE IS PRETTY MUCH CLEARING HIS\nCALENDAR TO THE EXTENT HE CAN IN OCTOBER TO CAMPAIGN FOR HER AND\nI THINK THAT HE MAKES PROBABLY THE BEST ARGUMENT.\nWE SAW IN 2012 AT THE CONVENTION HOW BILL CLINTON MADE THE\nARGUMENT FOR BARACK OBAMA, MADE THE ECONOMIC CASE FOR THAT.\nBARACK OBAMA IS HILLARY CLINTON'S BILL CLINTON, IF YOU\nWILL. I THINK HE CAN MAKE THE CASE\nBETTER. HE'S NOT RELATED TO HER, THEY\nUSED TO BE ADVERSARIES, I THINK HE HAS SOME CREDIBILITY HERE, AT\nLEAST WITH THAT COALITION HERE, SO SHE HAS A BIG BENCH THAT CAN\nTELL YOU HER ADVISORS WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEE HER ON THE ROAD SOON\nWHICH WE'RE TOLD WILL HAPPEN LATER THIS WEEK.\n>> JEFF ZELENY, WE ASK EVERYONE TO STAND BY.\n>>> COMING UP, WE'LL CONTINUE THIS DEBATE OVER THE\nDEPLORABLES, TRUMP'S RUNNING",

I JUST WANT TO ASK YOU, AS YOU\nLOOK AT THAT VIDEO, KCOREY, WHA IS YOUR RESPONSE TO THIS MAN\nHITTING A PROTESTER? >> I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY\nNOBODY WANTS TO ENCOURAGE VIOLENCE AT THE TRUMP RALLIES\nOBVIOUSLY AND WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO GIVE EVERYBODY\nTHE OPPORTUNITY TO COME TO AN EVENT AND PARTICIPATE AND LISTEN\nTO WHAT DONALD TRUMP HAS TO SAY AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY THE\nPOSITION OF THE CAMPAIGN, THAT'S MY BEST GUESS.\n>> I WANTED TO GET THE -- AS A PERSON CLOSEST TO THE CAMPAIGN\nSINCE THERE IS NO COMMENT SO THANK YOU FOR THAT.\nSO PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA WAS SAYING THERE'S DOUBLE STANDARD\nWHEN IT COMES TO THE TWO CANDIDATES, ONE IS BEING GRADED\nON A CURVE, THE OTHER ONE IS BEING GRADED HARSHER.\nDO YOU THINK THAT DONALD TRUMP GETS AWAY WITH THINGS THAT HAVE\nDISQUALIFIED ANY OTHER CANDIDATE?\n>> WHAT I THINK IS YOU'VE GOT DONALD TRUMP, WHO'S WILLING TO\nTALK -- >> OR HIM, THAT --\n>> DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN WILLING TO ENGAGE IN THE MEDIA WHEN\nHILLARY CLINTON HASN'T. WHAT IT TOOK WAS 272 DAYS FOR\nHER TO HOLD A PRESS CONFERENCE AND BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENED WAS\nSHE WAITED UNTIL THE PRESS CAME ON HER PLANE AND CAME OUT AND\nHAD SOME CONVERSATION AND SHE DID IT THREE DAYS IN A ROW, OH,\nMY GOD, SHE'S SO ACCESSIBLE. DONALD TRUMP HAS DONE HUNDREDS\nOF INTERVIEWS WITH THE MEDIA AND SO --\n>> I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND YES, IT DID TAKE HER\nA LONG TIME. AND MORE SPECIFICALLY, IF\nHILLARY CLINTON OR ANY OF THE OTHER 15 OR SO CANDIDATES UP ON\nTHE STAGE WITH DONALD TRUMP HAD SAID SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HE\nHAS SAID -- >> THAT SHOULD DISQUALIFY HER,\nTHE BASKET OF DEPLORABLES. >> DONALD TRUMP SAID MEXICAN\nRAPISTS AND SOME OF THEM -- AND SOME\nSOME OF THEM, I WOULD IMAGINE ARE GOOD PEOPLE.\nTHAT'S A VERY SIMILAR STATEMENT. >> DO YOU KNOW WHAT TRUMP TALKED\nABOUT AND TALKED TO? HE TALKS VERY GENUINE AND WHAT\nHE DOES IS HE'S NOT A POLISHED POLITICIAN, HE HASN'T SPENT 30\nYEARS IN THE PUBLIC EYE HONING THEIR SPECIFIC WORDS SO THAT\nAMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LISTEN, OH, MY GOD, THIS IS\nEXACTLY THE RIGHT THING.

I DON'T COMPLAIN ABOUT IT\nBECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO ENCOURAGE IT.\nWE LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE PEOPLE HAVE THE ANONYMITY OF THE\nINTERNET AND THEY FEEL LIKE THEY CAN DO OR SAY WHATEVER THEY\nWANT.

YOU HAVE TO STOP BEING SICK AND\nEXPLAINING AWAY THINGS THAT ARE UNEXPLAINABLE.\nTHERE ARE DEPLORABLE ASPECTS OF HIS CAMPAIGN, HIS INTEGRITY AND\nLACK THEREOF. >> EVERY NATIONAL CAMPAIGN HAS\nNUTS. >> I HAVE TO STOP HERE.\nI HAVE TO STOP HERE. >> IT SPEAKS TO THE CHARACTER OF\nTHE CAMPAIGN. >> ALL RIGHT.\nI HAVE TO STOP IT HERE.

THE YOUNG VOTERS, MINORITY\nVOTERS, COLLEGE EDUCATED WOMEN VOTERS THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS\nGOING TO NEED TO WIN IN NOVEMBER AND THIS COMES AS HE'S RIDING A\nWAVE OF POPULARITY. THE LATEST POLL FROM ABC NEWS\nAND THE WASHINGTON POST PUTS HIS APPROVAL RATING AT 58%.\nTHAT IS THE HIGHEST NUMBER IN THAT POLL SINCE SIX MONTHS AFTER\nHE TOOK OFFICE BACK IN 2008. HE'S PARTICULARLY POPULAR AMONG\nTHE CONSTITUENCY. SO THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO GO\nOUT AND STUMP FOR HER.

HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMP IS\nHITTING BACK WITH A NEW AD. >>> HOW STUPID ARE THE PEOPLE OF\nTHE COUNTRY.

BOTH SIDES CAN EXAGGERATE.\nIN THIS PARTICULAR ELECTION ACTUALLY UNFORTUNATELY THERE\nDOESN'T NEED TO BE ANY EXAGGERATION.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS SAID SOME THINGS THAT YOU JUST TAKE THE\nQUOTES, YOU JUST USE THEM.

SO COREY CAN SAY, YOU KNOW, OH,\nTHERE'S NOTHING IN THOSE TAX RETURNS.\nWELL, IF THERE'S NOTHING IN THEM, COREY, WHY CAN'T WE SEE\nTHEM? AND IT'S NONSENSE TO BELIEVE\nTHAT IT'S BECAUSE OF AN AUDIT. THERE'S A VERY CLEAR REASON, AND\nTHE THING THAT DONALD TRUMP HATES THE MOST IS WHEN PEOPLE\nGET AT THE FACT THAT HE IS WORTH SO VASTLY MUCH LESS THAN HE\nCLAIMS. HE DOESN'T WANT THAT TO COME\nOUT, AND HE DOESN'T WANT IT TO COME OUT THAT HE'S CONTRIBUTED.\n>> I WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND.\n>> I LIKE TONY, BUT THE TRUTH IS HE WANTED TO WRITE A SECOND BOOK\nWITH DONALD TRUMP AND DONALD TRUMP SAID NO.\n>> LET'S BE REALLY CLEAR.

THAT'S A VERY HARD LINE TO WALK.\n>> GLORIA, TRUMP KEEPS SAYING, PUTIN SAYS NICE THINGS ABOUT ME\nSO I'LL SAY NICE THINGS ABOUT HIM.\nTHAT'S BEEN A PHRASE HE'S. OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS.\n>> IF YOU SAY A NICE THING ABOUT ME, I'LL SAY A NICE THING ABOUT\nYOU. HE TELLS YOU THAT.\nIF PUTIN WERE TO START CRITICIZING DONALD TRUMP, WHICH\nI DOUBT DOLE.

I THINK AS HE DICTATOR.\nAND NOT DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM TRUMP WHO WAS AFTER ALL AT THE\nTOP OF THE TICKET.

SECONDLY, ALL THE U.S. CARRIERS\nARE RUNNING VERY AGGRESSIVE PROMOTIONS WHERE YOU CAN TRADE\nIN AN OLD PHONE AND GET AN iPHONE 7 FOR FREE.\nWE DIDN'T SEE THESE KIND OF PROMOTIONS LAST YEAR.\nSO THE COMPARABLES A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.\nALL THAT SAID SPRINT AND T-MOBILE MIGHT ACCOUNT FOR 5% OF\nFLOEBL VOLUMES FOR APPLE.

IT'S INTERESTING THAT THE\nBIGGEST DIFFERENCE IS ONE THAT'S GETTING A LOT OF SORT OF\nAMUSEMENT AND PUZZLEMENT, WHICH ARE THESE WIRELESS HEADPHONES OR\nEAR BUDS.

THAT INSTALL BASE IS 50% HIGHER\nENTERING THE iPHONE 7 CYCLE THAN IT WAS TWO YEARS AGO, ENTERING\nTHE iPHONE 6 CYCLE. CERTAINLY THE INSTALL BASE IS\nMUCH BIGGER.

THE DYNAMIC OF THE COMPOSITION\nOF WHO IS BUYING PHONES, TODAY IT'S ALL REPLACEMENT.\nFIVE YEARS AGO IT WAS LARGELY FIRST-TIME BUYERS.\n>> I HAVE TO SAY I'M ALMOST EMBARRASSED TO ADMIT THIS, BUT I\nAM STILL ON AN iPHONE 5. I WILL BE UPGRADING, BUT IT'S\nNOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE I'M THAT EXCITED ABOUT THIS NEW PHONE.\nI TOTALLY FIT INTO THAT DEMOGRAPHIC.\nIT'S EMBARRASSING AAS A TECH WRITER.\n>> SHE HAS A POINT. THAT LEADS TO MY FOLLOW-UP.\nWHY IS IT THAT PEOPLE UPGRADE TO THE 6S OR SE INSTEAD OF THE 7?\nANY WAY YOU HAVE OF CALCULATING THAT?\n>> AS FAR AS APPLE IS CONCERNED, PEOPLE BUYING NEW PHONES IS GOOD\nFOR THEIR BUSINESS. WHETHER THEY UPGRADE TO A 7 OR\niPHONE 6S, THE MARGINS ARE LIKELY PRETTY SIMILAR.\nTHE PLUS MODELS TEND TO HAVE BETTER MARGINS.\nTHE REVENUES ARE A BIT BETTER ON THE iPHONE 7 OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE\nOF THE HIGHER PRICES. BUT FOR APPLE AND FOR THE\nINVESTMENT COMMUNITY, IT'S REALLY NUMBER OF UNITS SOLD.\nAND I THINK APPLE HAS INCREASINGLY TRIED TO PROVIDE\nALTERNATIVES FOR CONSUMERS, WHETHER IT BE THE SE,\nONE-YEAR-OLD PHONE OR CURRENT MODEL PHONE.\nTHAT'S GOING TO BE THE DOMINANT DRIVER OF ITS ECONOMICS LESS SO\nTHE MYTHS. >> LEGAL BATTLE TO COME BETWEEN\nAPPLE AND THE EU.

THAT'S NOT A BLUE TOOTH.\n>> THESE ARE APPLE'S OWN KIND OF TWIST ON BLUE TOOTH.\nI THINK THE HEAD PHONE JACK IS A BIG DEAL.\nIT'S A JACK THAT'S BEEN TAKEN AWAY.\nYOU NEED THAT STILL. MAYBE WE'LL GO HEAD PHONE\nJACKLESS. THERE ARE ENOUGH EVERY DAY\nTHINGS THAT THE PERSON WILL REACH FOR WILL FEEL ANNOYED.\nIT'S LIKE THE 12 INCH MAC BOOK. IT'S THE FUTURE BUT DOES THAT\nHAVE TO BE RIGHT NOW. >> APPLE THINKS IT'S A DINOSAUR.\nYOUR OVERALL REVIEW OF THE PHONE?\n>> PRETTY MUCH THE SAME. I THINK PEOPLE NEED TO REALIZE\nREMOVING THE HEADPHONE JACK DOES HAVE BENEFITS.\nNUMBER ONE, CAMERA, THERE'S MORE SPACE FOR BETTER CAMERA AND\nBATTERY LIFE. THE CAMERA TO ME IS ONE OF THE\nBIGGEST REASONS TO UPGRADE HERE. I HAVE AN iPHONE 6S.\nI WASN'T PLANNING ON UPGRADING. I STARTED TAKING SAMPLE SHOTS\nAND NOW I BOUGHT A NEW PHONE. PEOPLE NEED TO LOOK AT THOSE TWO\nTHINGS WHEN THEY'RE CONSIDERING UPGRADES.\nBATTERY LIFE AND CAMERA, YES, HEADPHONE PORT IS KIND OF A\nPAIN. >> THE BATTERY LIFE IS ONLY ONE\nTO TWO HOURS MORE THAN YOU ARE GETTING.\nIS THAT REALLY THAT MUCH, SCOTT? >> IT WAS ENOUGH IN USING IT,\nWE'RE STILL DOING FULL BATTERY TESTS TO GET ME THROUGH A DAY\nTHROUGHOUT THE PROCESS OF DOING THIS WITHOUT HAVING TO RECHARGE.\nIF YOU JUST GET OVER THAT HUMP THAT'S USEFUL.\nTHERE ARE A LOT OF PHONES WITH GREAT BATTERY LIFE NOW.\nI DON'T THINK IT'S COMPETING ON THAT SUPER CRAZY ELEMENT.\nI THINK IT FINALLY GETS TO TOWARDS THE END OF THE DAY,\nFINE. >> I'M GOING GOING HAVE TO A\nBATTERY CASE ON MY PHONE. DOES APPLE NEED TO DO BETTER ON\nBATTERIES? ABSOLUTELY, ACROSS THE BOARD,\nESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE iPHONE.\nTHEY SELL A CASE FOR BETTER BATTERY LIFE.\nTHEY MAKE IT. >> THAT'S A BIG REASON TO THE\nLACK OF HEAD PHONE JACK. ESPECIALLY IN THE SMALLER\nPHONES, ALLOWS YOU TO HAVE A BETTER BATTERY.\nI WANT TO READ YOU A COUPLE TWEET FROM VIEWERS.\nWOW, DOES HE KNOW WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE WITH THOSE HEAD PHONES ON?\nHIS WIRELESS HEADPHONES LOOK LIKE BROKEN Q-TIPS IN HIS EARS.\n>> ARE THEY SAYING I LOOK BETTER?\nI PULL THEM OFF. SORRY, SCOTT.\n>> THIS BECAME A MEME OVER THE WEEKEND.\nTHE REVIEWS REALLY EMBARRASSING. I KNEW THESE LOOK RIDICULOUS.\nIF YOU HAVE ONE IN IT LOOKS LIKE A BLUE TOOTH EAR PHONE HEAD SET.\nTWO IN YOU LOOK LIKE A HIPSTER JEWELRY ALIEN.\nLOOK ON READ IT FOR OTHER SUGGESTIONS.\n>> MAYBE IT'S A LOOK SOME PEOPLE ARE GOING FOR.\n>> YES. MAYBE IT WAS NECESSARY FOR\nTHINGS LIKE MICROPHONE OR ANTENNA.\nYOU'LL SEE A LOT OF OTHER DESIGNS.\nYOU DON'T HAVE TO GO WITH THAT ONE.\nIT'S NOT GOOGLE GLASS. THESE PARTICULAR ONES ARE A\nLITTLE BIT FUNKY LOOKING. >> ALL RIGHT.\n>> YOU WANT TO DO THE WATER? >> I DO.\n>> THE LACK OF A HEAD PHONE JACK MAKES WATERPROOFING A LOT\nEASIER, YES? >> YES.\nTHERE ARE PHONES WITH A HEADPHONE JACK THAT ARE JUST AS\nWATERPROOF IF NOT ALL. >> THAT'S THE THING.\n>> WE'RE GOING TO DO THEM ALL. >> THEY'RE ALL BLACK.\n>> WHAT ARE WE PUTTING IN THERE? >> WE HAVE TWO iPHONE 7s AND TWO\niPHONE 7 PLUSES. I'VE DONE A BIT OF WATER TESTING\nOVER THE LAST WEEK. APPLE SAYS THIS WILL BE OKAY,\nRIGHT? YOU DROP IT IN THE TOILET.\nTHIS HAPPENS A LOT. PEOPLE THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS BUT\nIT HAPPENS A LOT, A SPLASH IN THE POOL, THAT'S FINE.\nWHAT APPLE DOESN'T WANT YOU TO DO IS SWIM WITH IT.\nHOWEVER -- >> WHICH YOU DID.\n>> I DID. BECAUSE WE DONE THE HAVE TO\nLISTEN TO EVERYTHING APPLE TELLS US TO DO.\nSO I WAS REALLY SURPRISED YOU SHOULD NOT DO THIS AT HOME.\nBUT I WAS FINE. AND SO THE BIG THING EVERYONE\nNEEDS TO KNOW IS APPLE IS NOT GOING TO COVER WATER DAMAGE.\nYOU COME IN WITH A PHONE THAT'S WATER DAMAGED YOU ARE NOT\nGETTING A NEW PHONE. THAT IS ON YOU.\nDO NOT DO THAT. >> I WAS ACTUALLY HAD A PHONE\nTHAT GOT WATER DAMAGE. YOU DUNK IT IN THE BAG OF RICE.\n>> DID IT WORK? >> IT DID.\nNOT AS WELL AS IT DID BEFORE. I WANT YOU TO TURN THESE ON\nWITHOUT THE INSURANCE POLICY OF THE BAG OF RICE.\n>> THESE ARE ACTUALLY -- SCOTT, I'VE GOT YOUR PHONE.\n>> WE ALL HAVE THE SAME PHONE. >> THIS IS THE PHONE I SWAM WITH\nFOR QUITE A FEW HOURS THIS WEEKEND.\nIT'S BEEN WORKING PHONE. THAT COMPARED TO THE GALAXY NOTE\n7, THAT HAS A WHOLE OTHER SET OF ISSUES WE DONE THE WANT TO TALK\nABOUT RIGHT NOW. WHEN I SWAM WITH THAT FOR A LONG\nTIME, IT STARTED TO GET WONKY. APPLE SAYS I DON'T WANT TO DO\nTHIS. >> YOU DON'T WANT TO GO IN SALT\nWATER. I THREW THEM IN THE SHOWER, LEFT\nTHEM IN A SINK FILLED WITH WATER FOR A WHILE.\nTHE SCREENS GET SKITTISH UNDER WATER.\nTHE IDEA OF USING THEM IN THE SHOWER IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.\nWAIT TO DRY THEM BEFORE CHARGING.\n>> BIG POINT. >> A COUPLE OF HOURS.\n>> THAT'S GOOD. >> LAST ONE, TELL HIM TO SAY THE\nCIGARETTE BUTTS OUT OF HIS EAR. THEY'RE ALL AIMED AT YOU.\n>> I'M THE TARGET. >> I LOVE THIS SHOW.\n>> BEAT ME UP. BEAT ME UP.\n>> GREAT STUFF. THANKS FOR COMING IN, JOANNA\nSTERN, SCOTT STEIN OF THE JOURNAL AND CNET.\n>> YOU LOOK GOOD. >>> COMING UP, WE'LL HEAD BACK\nTO DELIVERING ALPHA WHERE WE'LL SIT DOWN WITH UBS'S GLOBAL HEAD\nOF EQUITIES, DAWN FITZPATRICK.

THE TRUTH IS, WE TALK ABOUT\nTHESE INDEPENDENTS, DEPENDS HOW YOU DEFINE THEM, BUT I WOULD\nARGUE THERE ARE ACTUALLY 10% OR LESS THAT ARE TRULY UNDECIDED.\nMAYBE EVEN MID TO LOW SINGLE DIGITS.\nMOST PEOPLE KNOW HOW THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE.\nTHEY'RE LEANING, OR THEY HAVE FIRMLY DECIDED.\nIT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO BE UNDECIDED IN THIS PARTICULAR\nELECTION. MOST PEOPLE HAVE STRONG\nFEELINGS. >> SO I WANT TO PLAY SOMETHING\nTHAT HAPPENED ON THE MORNING SHOW HERE ON CNN, ON \"NEW DAY\nTODAY,\" BECAUSE SOMETIME THIS WEEK WE'RE EXPECTING AT LEAST\nMORE INFORMATION ABOUT HEALTH, MAYBE FROM BOTH OF THE\nCANDIDATES, MAYBE HILLARY WILL RETURN TO THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\nSHE SAID SHE'LL RELEASE MORE INFORMATION.\nDONALD TRUMP SAID HE GOT ANOTHER CHECKUP FROM HIS DOCTOR AND\nPLANS TO RELEASE MORE INFORMATION AND KELLYANNE CONWAY\nWAS ASKED ABOUT THAT ORIGINAL DOCTOR'S LETTER THAT MADE SO\nMANY OUTRIGHT LAUGH, THE ASTASTON\nINGISHINGLY GOOD HEALTH RECORD. >> AS FAR AS I CAN SEE THERE ARE\nTWO MAJOR PARTY CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AND ONLY\nONE HAS PNEUMONIA AND LIED ABOUT IT, ESPECIALLY TO THE PRESS.\nSHE ALWAYS THINKS SHE, TREATS YOU ALL LIKE SECOND-CLASS PRESS\nCONFERENCES. WON'T HAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE\nAND UPLIFTS, ASPIRATIONAL AND GOES ON TO ATTACK TENS OF\nMILLIONS OF AMERICANS THE VERY NEXT DAY.\n>> WELL, THAT SORT OF MIGRATED AWAY FROM THE HEALTH QUESTION\nAND I THINK THE HEALTH QUESTION REMAINS BIG.\nJASON, THE BIG PART OF IT IS, WILL THIS END UP BEING BATTLE OF\nTHE EXPERTS? BATTLE OF THE DOCTORS?\nWHOSE DOCTOR IS MORE CREDIBLE WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT THE\nCAMPAIGNS ARE GOING TO RELEASE? >> ACTUALLY I THINK IT'S A\nMATTER, ASHLEIGH, OF VOTER PERCEPTION.\nA GENDER ASPECT, AN HON NEFRTES ASPECT.\nA LONG TIME TRUMP SURROGATES HAVE SAID HILLARY'S SICK,\nUNHEALTHY. SHE'S GOT A BODY DOUBLE.\nBASICALLY SAYING THAT THE DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGN IS \"WEEKEND\nAT BERNIE'S.\" PASSED AWAY MONTHS AGO AND\nTHEY'RE PROPPING HER UP TO WIN THE WHITE HOUSE.\nTHIS PLAYS UP TO A NOTION OF A DISHONEST FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\nTHAT WORKS FOR DONALD TRUMP. ON A PRACTICAL LEVEL, MOST DON'T\nCARE. THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T HAVE TO\nLEAD US AGAINST THE WAR OF THE VIKINGS.\nAS LONG AS IT'S NOT CANCER OR LIFE-THREATENING, I DON'T THINK\nVOTERS WILL CHANGE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.\nIF HILLARY CLINTON COLLAPSES DURING A DEBATE, THAT'S ONE\nTHING. IF SHE CAN CONTINUE TO CAMPAIGN\nIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS, I DON'T THINK IT WILL CHANGE\nANYTHING. >> JASON JOHNSON WITH THE NEW 70\nIS THE NEW 50. I SAY WE CAN DO 68 AND 70,\nPEOPLE STARTING TO ASK ABOUT ALL SORTS OF THINGS.\nTHANK YOU OFTEN. APPRECIATE IT.\nTHANK YOU, GUYS.",

ALL OF THIS WITH JUST UNDER 56\nDAYS TO GO UNTIL THE U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.\n13 DAYS OUT FROM THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE.\nTHE TWO CAMPAIGNS ARE IN VERY DIFFERENT FOOTING RIGHT NOW.\nDONALD TRUMP IS ON THE OFFENSIVE TAKING SHOTS AT HILLARY CLINTON\nOVER HER CALLING HALF OF HIS SUPPORTERS, I'M QUOTING NOW,\nDEPLORABLES. THAT HAS BECOME THE NEXUS OF HIS\nLATEST ATTACKS. >> WE HAVE EVERYBODY SUPPORTING\nUS, FOLKS. EVERYBODY.\nWE HAVE PEOPLE -- WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL.\nWE HAVE SOME THAT HAVEN'T QUITE BEEN AS SUCCESSFUL.\nLET ME TELL YOU, WE HAVE EVERYBODY, BECAUSE EVERYBODY\nKNOWS WHAT A MESS OUR COUNTRY IS IN.\nSHE LOOKS DOWN ON THE PEOPLE WHO COOK HER MEALS, DRIVE HER CARS\nAND DIG THE COAL THAT POWER HER ELECTRICITY.\n>> ON THE OTHER SIDE, YOU HAVE THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN RIGHT NOW\nHILLARY CLINTON IS SCHEDULED TO GET BACK INTO THE CAMPAIGN GAME\nBY THURSDAY, AND A CONGRESSIONAL HISPANIC CAUCUS EVENT HERE IN\nWASHINGTON. FOR NOW SHE'S OBEYING HER\nDOCTORS' ORDERS ARE GETTING SOME REST WHILE SHE DEALS WITH A BOUT\nOF PNEUMONIA THAT HAS PUT CLINTON AND HER CAMPAIGN ON THE\nDEFENSE, SPENDING THE MAJORITY OF THEIR TIME EXPLAINING HER\nILLNESS AND THE REASON HER DIAGNOSIS WASN'T REVEALED RIGHT\nAWAY. >> I JUST DIDN'T THINK IT WAS\nGOING TO BE THAT BIG A DEAL. YOU KNOW, I KNOW CHUCK SAID\nTODAY, HE DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY. IT'S JUST THE KIND OF THING IF\nIT HAPPEN TO YOU AND YOUR A BUSY, ACTIVE PERSON, YOU KEEP\nMOVING FORWARD, AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY, ANDERSON\nTHAT PEOPLE KNOW MORE ABOUT ME THAN ALMOST ANYONE IN PUBLIC\nLIFE. IT'S SO STRANGE THAT WITH ALL OF\nTHAT INFORMATION OUT THERE, AND AS SOON AS IT BECAME CLEAR I\nCOULDN'T POWER THROUGH, WE, YOU KNOW, WE SAID WHAT WAS GOING ON.\n>> I THINK EVERYTHING'S A CAMPAIGN ISSUE.\nI THINK HER LIFESTYLE AND HER UNDERLYING INDICATOR FROM BLOOD\nPRESSURE TO AMOUNT OF EXERCISE TO EVERYTHING ELSE MEANS IT'S\nALMOST CERTAIN SHE'S IN BETTER HEALTH THAN HER OPPONENT, BUT WE\nDON'T KNOW, BECAUSE HE HASN'T DISCLOSED.\n>> THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS PUSHING FOR MORE TRANSPARENCY\nFROM DONALD TRUMP, FROM MEDICAL RECORDS TO TAX RECORDS TO\nCHARITABLE FOUNDATION RECORDS, BUT FOR DONALD TRUMP, HE'S GOT\nHIS FOOT ON THE GAS NOW FULL SPEED AHEAD WITH HIS ATTACKS\nAGAINST HILLARY CLINTON. OUR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT JASON\nCARROLL IS IN IOWA RIGHT NOW AT THE TRUMP EVENT.\nOUR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT MICHELLE KACZYNSKI IS WITH THE\nPRESIDENT IN PHILADELPHIA FOR THE CLINTON EVENT LATER THIS\nHOUR. WE'LL HAVE COVERAGE OF BOTH.\nSTAND BY FOR THAT. JASON, SHOULD WE EXPECT DONALD\nTRUMP TO KEEP FOCUSING IN ON THAT NARRATIVE AND CLINTON'S\nDEPLORABLES COMMENT? >> Reporter: WITHOUT QUESTION,\nWOLF. LOOK, EVEN BEFORE I WALKED INTO\nTHIS VENUE I RAN INTO A WOMAN WEARING AN \"I LOVE DEPLORABLES\"\nT-SHIRT. SHE MADE IT HERSELF.\nONE OF THE SPEAKERS JUST UP A SHORT WHILE AGO REACHED OUT AND\nSAID WHAT A GREAT LOOKING GROUP OF DEPLORABLES, AND THE CROWD\nERUPTED WITH APPLAUSE. SOMETHING, WOLF, THAT TOUCH ADD\nNERVE WITH A NUMBER OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS.\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN KNOWS THAT. TRUMP CRITICIZED CLINTON FOR\nTHIS LAST NIGHT. HE'S GOING TO DO IT AGAIN TODAY\nWHEN WHEN HE TAKE AS STAGE A FEW MOMENTS FROM NOW.\nEXPECT MORE CRITICISM. HE SAYS IT'S MORE EVIDENCE THAT\nHILLARY CLINTON IS OUT OF TOUCH WITH WORKING-CLASS VOTERS.\nSO MORE CRITICISM OF CLINTON TODAY.\nTONIGHT, THOUGH, WOLF, WE SHOULD TELL YOU, TRUMP WILL BE TALKING\nPOLICY WHEN HE'S IN PENNSYLVANIA.\nHE'LL BE UNVEILING HIS CHILD CARE AFFORDABILITY PLAN, HIS\nDAUGHTER IVANKA TRUMP PLANNING TO JOIN HIM.\nSHE'S BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN PUTTING TOGETHER THIS PLAN.\nSO TONIGHT IT'S GOING TO BE POLICY, BUT TODAY HERE IN IOWA,\nIT'S GOING TO BE ALL THAT CRITICISM AND HILLARY CLINTON\nAND THAT DEPLORABLES COMMENT. WOLF?\n>> WE'RE TOLD HE'LL HIT THE HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN VERY\nHARD. MICHELLE, YOU'RE THERE IN\nPHILADELPHIA. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES IS SPEAKING LATER THIS HOUR THERE.\nWE'RE TOLD HE'LL BE HITTING DONALD TRUMP PRETTY HARD AS\nWELL. WHAT ARE YOU HEARING ABOUT THE\nTONE, THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT WILL SAY?\n>> Reporter: WE KNOW GENERALLY THE PRESIDENT LIKES TO STAY OUT\nOF THE FRAY. HE DOESN'T LIKE TO, EVEN MENTION\nHIS NAME, WHEN OUT IN A PUBLIC EVENT LIKE THIS.\nHE WILL REFER, THOUGH, TO THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE.\nIN A SETTING LIKE THIS HE LIKES TO GIVE THESE KINDS OF DIGS,\nSOMETIMES USING HUMOR TO GET THE CROWD GOING.\nKIND OF LIKE AN ASIDE. HINT, HINT, WE ALL KNOW WHO I'M\nTALKING ABOUT, RIGHT? IT'S A PRESS CONFERENCE SETTING\nHE IS ASKED QUESTIONS DIRECTLY ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS DONALD\nTRUMP HAS SAID THAT HE GETS MORE CUTTING.\nTHAT HE REALLY GETS CRITICAL. RECENTLY WE HEARD HIM SAY THAT\nDONALD TRUMP IS NOT QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES. AND THE PRESIDENT SAID HE PROVES\nTHAT EVERY TIME HE OPENS HIS MOUTH.\nI DON'T KNOW HE'S GOING TO BE THAT CRITICAL HERE.\nI MEAN, AT AN EVENT LIKE THIS, WHERE HE HAS HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE\nGATHERED, HERE IN PHILADELPHIA, AT THE ART MUSEUM, THE STEPS,\nKNOWN AS THE ROCKY STEPS, E HAD LIKES TO KEEP THE TONE POSITIVE.\nLIKES TO BOOST HILLARY CLINTON. TRY TO REV THE BASE UP, GET\nPEOPLE OUT TO VOTE. THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE WHITE\nHOUSE SEES PRESIDENT OBAMA'S NUMBER ONE GOAL BEING.\nNOT NECESSARILY TO TRY TO WIN VOTERS AWAY FROM DONALD TRUMP.\nI MEAN, LOOK AT THIS. OBVIOUSLY HE'S PREACHING TO THE\nCHOIR, BUT THEY SEE HIM AS MOTIVATING PEOPLE TO GET THE\nVOTE OUT. THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY GOING TO BE\nCRITICAL, OF COURSE IN THIS TIGHT RACE, WOLF.\n>> THIS IS THE FIRST TIME, MICHELLE THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS\nGONE OUT ON HIS OWN, SOLO, TO CAMPAIGN FOR HILLARY CLINTON,\nBUT WHAT DO WE EXPECT IN THE WEEKS TO COME BETWEEN NOW AND\nNOVEMBER 8th, THE DAY OF THE ELECTION?\n>> Reporter: I MEAN, WE DID EXPECT TO SEE MORE.\nREMEMBER A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO TALKING HOW PRESIDENT OBAMA\nWOULD LIKELY BE THE MOST ACTIVE PRESIDENT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL\nIN HISTORY, BUT WE REALLY HAVEN'T SEEN THAT.\nMAINLY BECAUSE OF HIS SCHEDULE. REMEMBER THAT FIRST EVENT\nPLANNED WITH HILLARY CLINTON HAD TO BE POSTPONED BECAUSE OF THE\nORLANDO SHOOTINGS. SO SOME UNFORESEEN EVENTS GOT IN\nTHE WAY AS WELL. THAT WAS SUCH A DIFFICULT TIME\nTHAT HE HAD TO FOCUS ON AND KIND OF COOL THINGS OFF A LITTLE BIT.\nAND WE SAW HIM OUT WITH HILLARY IN JULY AND, OF COURSE, TWO\nMONTHS AGO ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL THAT SEEMS LIKE AN ETERNITY, BUT\nHIS SCHEDULE IS STILL DIFFICULT THIS MONTH.\nWE JUST GOT BACK FROM A FOREIGN TRIP.\nHE HAS THE U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY COMING UP.\nIT'S REALLY GOING TO BE OCTOBER THAT WE SEE HIM ACTIVE.\nAND WE'VE SEEN REPORTS OUT THERE AND PEOPLE SPECULATING THAT HE\nMIGHT SPEND VIRTUALLY THE ENTIRE MONTH OUT ON THE TRAIL.\nOUR SOURCES SAY THAT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE POSSIBLE, FOR IT\nTO BE THAT THAT EXTENT, WE SURELY CAN EXPECT TO SEE MUCH,\nMUCH MORE OF HIM AS SOON AS WE SEE OCTOBER, WOLF.\n>> LIVE COVERAGE OF HIS REMARKS COMING UP.\nMICHELLE KACZYNSKI, THANK YOU. AND JASON CARROLL WITH DONALD\nTRUMP EXPECTED TO SPEAK MOMENTARILY.\nTHANK YOU TO YOU AS WELL. TRADING BLOWS OVER WHOSE\nCAMPAIGN IS LESS TRANSPARENT. IN AN INTERVIEW WITH CNN'S\nRNDSON COOPER, HILLARY CLINTON TRIED TO TURNTA THE TABLES ON\nTRUMP. >> YOU'VE GOT A MEDICAL REPORT\nON ME THAT MEETS THE SAME STANDARD AT MITT ROMNEY AND\nBARACK OBAMA. DONALD TRUMP'S DOCTOR SAID HE'D\nBE THE HEALTHIEST PRESIDENT IN HISTORY.\nTHAT'S JUST NOT EVEN SERIOUS. AND I'VE RELEASED NEARLY 40\nYEARS OF TAX RETURNS. HE HASN'T RELEASED ONE.\nTHIS IS A MAN WITH UNKNOWN NUMBERS OF PARTNERS AND\nINVESTORS WHO SAYS HE'S DOING 120 FOREIGN DEALS.\nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE TO KNOW WHAT HE'S UP TO AND WHAT HE\nIS HIDING. >> LET'S BRING IN OUR PANEL, OUR\nSENIOR POLITICAL REPORTER WITH US, \"TIME\" MAGAZINE POLITICAL\nREPORTER ZEKE MILLER AND \"WASHINGTON POST\" REPORTER ED\nO'KEEFE. THANKS FOR JOINING US.\nIS THIS AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY WE SAW HER DISPLAY LAST NIGHT IN\nTHE PHONE INTERVIEW WITH ANDERSON COOPER?\n>> I THINK SO. WE OBVIOUSLY KNOW SHE HAS\nTRANSPARENCY PROBLEMS AND THEY SHOW UP IN TRUSTWORTHY NUMBERS,\nIN THIS EPISODE WITH THE HEALTH ISSUE MAGNIFIED NAP IN TURNS THE\nTABLES ON DONALD TRUMP SHE HAS TO MAKE SURE HE'S GETTING\nQUESTIONS ABOUT HIS TAX RETURNS, THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN PUSHED THIS IDEA LONG AGO THAT DONALD TRUMP\nDOESN'T HAVE, ISN'T JUDGED BY THE SAME STANDARDS.\nRIGHT? THAT HE GETS A PASS ON MANY OF\nTHESE THINGS. THE PRESS SOMETIMES LET'S HIM\nGET A PASS. SO I THINK IN TRYING TO TURN THE\nCONVERSATION TO DONALD TRUMP, IT IS AFFECTED, AND WE'VE SEEN\nDONALD TRUMP TRYING TO DO THE SAME THING WITH HER.\nI THINK IT ALSO WATERS DOWN HIS KEY ARGUMENT ABOUT HER WHICH IS\nTHAT SHE'S THE ONE WHO'S GOT SOMETHING TO HIDE, SHE'S THE ONE\nLOOKING IN TRANSPARENCY. I THINK WE'LL CONTINUE TO SEE\nHER DO THAT AND DONALD TRUMP. >> HE'S UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE,\nZEKE TO RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS. SAYS HE CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE\nHE'S STILL UNDER IRS AUDIT. EARLIER THIS MORNING ON CNN'S\n\"NEW DAY\" ALISON CAM WRK ALSOAL CAMEROTA SAID --\n>> ARE YOU CALLING HIM A LIAR? >> TAKING HIS WORD FOR.\n>> IT AND TAKING HILLARY CLINTON'S WORD SHE WAS\nOVERHEATED AND DIDN'T HAVE PNEUMONIA OR IS GOING TO BE\nASPIRATIONAL, UPLIFTING, START TALKING TO THE PRESS.\nSERIOUSLY, WE'RE RUNNING AGAINST A CLINTON AND GOING TO CHALLENGE\nSOMEONE'S VERACITY? >> THAT WAS CAMPAIGN MANAGER\nKELLYANNE CONWAY BASICALLY SAYING HE'S UNDER AUDIT.\nARE YOU CALLING HIM A LIAR, IF YOU WANT PROOF.\nTHIS IS A SENSITIVE ISSUE FOR BOTH OF THESE CAMPAIGNS BUT\nHILLARY CLINTON RELEASED 20 YEARS OF HER IRS RETURNS.\n>> A LOT OF PLACE, IT'S BEEN A RACE TO THE BOT WHUM IT COMES TO\nPRESS ACCESS, TRANSPARENCY, VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE OF ANY SORT\nOF INFORMATION. FOR INSTANCE, THE BASKET OF\nDEPLORABLES COMMENT AT A FUND-RAISER HILLARY CLINTON HAD.\nTRADITIONALLY THESE, SPEAKING OF BREAKING WITH THE PRESIDENT FROM\nMITT ROMNEY AND PRESIDENT OBAMA, HILLARY CLINTON GENERALLY\nDOESN'T ALLOW PRESS IN HER FUND-RAISERS.\nIN TERMS OF GETTING INFORMATION OUT TO THE PRESS IN A TIMELY\nMANNER, SUNDAY MORNING, THE HEALTH EPISODE, SHE WAITED A\nWHILE BEFORE TELLING THE PRESS ABOUT IT.\nDONALD TRUMP AND TAX RETURNS, YES, ASKING PEOPLE TO TRUST HIM,\nAND YES, HE DOES GET A BUSINESS OF A PASS, MOSTLY FROM VOTERS,\nNOT THE PRESS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS NOW.\nHIS VOTERS RIGHT NOW DON'T CARE HE'S NOT RELEASING TAX RETURNS.\n>> THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES ARRIVING IN PHILADELPHIA,\nJUST MOMENTS AGO. HE'LL SPEAK SHORTLY, LATER THIS\nHOUR, IN PHILADELPHIA TO CAMPAIGN RALLY IN SUPPORT OF\nHILLARY CLINTON. ED, IS THERE ANY INDICATION AT\nALL YOU COVERED THIS VERY WELL, THAT DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO\nRELEASE AT LEAST SOME ASPECTS OF HIS TAX RETURNS?\nEASTERN THE YEARS THAT ARE, THAT ALREADY HAVE BEEN AUDITED?\nUP TO 2008. HE COULD RELEASE THOSE.\nHE COULD ALSO JUST RELEASE THE PERCENTAGE OF TAX HE PAID THE\nCHARITIABILITY CONTRIBUTIONS HE MADE.\nHE COULD RELEASE THAT KIND OF INFORMATION WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING\nHIS AUDIT? >> I'D SAY THE \"WASHINGTON POST\"\nHAS BEEN LOOKING AT THIS SPECIFICALLY, MY COLLEAGUE WOULD\nBE THRILLED TO SEE ALL THAT INFORMATION, BECAUSE IT'S LED TO\nREAMS OF REPORTING THAT INCLUDE NO COMMENT FROM THE CAMPAIGN,\nAND THUS LEAVES ALL OF THESE QUESTIONS OPEN.\nHE ABSOLUTELY COULD, AND MEDICAL INFORMATION AS WELL.\nTHE EXCUSE OF, WE, I MAY NOT HAVE GIVEN ANYTHING, BUT HE'S\nWORSE. SORRY.\nEVERYONE AT THIS TABLE, EVERYONE IN THIS BUILDING AND EVERY NEWS\nORGANIZATION SHOULD BE FURIOUS WITH BOTH OF THESE CAMPAIGNS FOR\nBEING SO SECRETIVE, FRANKLY, ABOUT THIS STUFF, AND IT WAS\nENCOURAGING TO SEE THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN ADMIT OVER THE WEEKEND\nPERHAPS THEY STUMBLED A BIT INFORMING US'S ALL OF THESE\nTHINGS BUT NO EXCUSE. THIS PERSON WANTS TO BE THE MOST\nPOWERFUL PERSON IN THE WORLD. VOTERS TRADITIONALLY WANT THIS.\nSUPPORTER",

WELCOME TO \"LEGAL VIEW.\"\nIF YOU THINK YOU'VE SEEN IT ALL IN THE 2016 RACE FOR PRESIDENT,\nA RACE WITH JUST 56 DAYS REMAINING, WE GOT NEWS FOR YOU.\nLITERALLY ON CNN. YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IT ALL.\nTHE NEXT HOUR YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A FIRST.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA CAMPAIGNING SOLO FOR THE WOMAN HE DEARLY HOPES\nWILL SUCCEED HIM IN THE BATTLEGROUND STATE OF\nPENNSYLVANIA. DONALD TRUMP WILL SPEAK FOR\nHIMSELF. NEXT HOUR, IN THE BATTLEGROUND\nSTATE OF IOWA. TONIGHT JOINED BY HIS DAUGHTER\nIVANKA, WHILE HILLARY CLINTON IS GOING TO SPEND YET ANOTHER DAY\nNURSING THE PNEUMONIA THAT TRUMP CAMP MANAGED TO USE AGAINST HER,\nWHILE PUBLICLY SENDING THEIR VERY BEST WISHES FOR A SPEEDY\nRECOVERY. MY CNN COLLEAGUE JASON CARROLL\nSON THE OUTSKIRTS OF DES MOINES WHERE DONALD TRUMP IS DUE TO\nSPEAK ABOUT 1:00 EASTERN TIME AND JEFF ZELENY IS HERE WITH ME\nLIVE IN NEW YORK. JEFF, SPEAKING WITH YOU FIRST,\nBECAUSE WE ARE NOW DAY TWO OF A THE TRAIL AND 56 DAYS TO GO, YOU\nDON'T WANT TO BE OFF THE TRAIL, YOU DON'T.\nDEFINITELY SHE HAS A SCHEDULE AND IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER SHE\nWAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN LOS ANGELES TODAY RAISING MONEY AND\nBILL CLINTON IS FILLING IN FOR HER DOING THAT.\nSHE IS I'M TOLD, SPEND TIME PREPARING FOR THE DEBATE IN 13\nDAYS. I DON'T THINK IT'S AS MUCH OF A\nCRISIS TO HAVE HER OFF THE TRAIL AT THIS MOMENT AS THEY TRY AND\nDEAL WITH THIS TRANSPARENCY. THE BIGGER QUESTION, WORRIES\nINSIDE HER CAMPAIGN THAT THIS IS SORT OF CREATED SOMETHING THAT\nTHEY THOUGHT THEY'D COOLED DOWN. THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT HER\nTRANSPARENCY AND HER HONESTY AND THING, BUT THEY ARE TRYING TO\nFIGURE OUT HOW TO GET HER BACK ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\n>> WHEN? >> HEALTH IS ACTUALLY A SERIOUS\nCONCERN. I WAS HEARING POTENTIALLY COULD\nBE ON THE ROAD AS EARLY AS TOMORROW, POSSIBLY IN\nPHILADELPHIA. NOW, IT MAY BE LATER IN THE\nWEEK. SHE'S DEFINITELY AT LEAST\nSCHEDULED TO BE IN WASHINGTON FOR A CONGRESSIONAL HISPANIC\nCAUCUS DINNER THURSDAY AND SPEAKING AGAIN IN WASHINGTON\nFRIDAY, BUT SHE ACTUALLY IS FOLLOWING DOCTORS' ORDERS, OR AT\nLEAST UNDER THEM AND HAS NOT GONON A GREEN LIGHT TO GO AHEAD\nAND START CAMPAIGNING AGAIN. >> JASON CARROLL, YESTERDAY\nMIGHT HAVE BEEN WHAT SOME WOULD CALL A BIT OF A GIFT FOR THE\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON TOOK IT ON THE CHIN FOR\nTRANSPARENCY, ALL THE WHILE, PESKY QUESTIONS ABOUT TAX\nRETURNS HAVE NOT BEEN ANSWERED, OR HAVE BEEN ANSWERED IN A WAY\nTHAT SEEM UNSATISFYING TO SOME. I WANT TO PLAY FOR YOU, JASON,\nIF I CAN, MIKE PENCE, TRUMP'S RUNNING MATE, GRILLED BY WOLF\nBLITZER ABOUT THE TAX RETURNS, AND ABOUT THE RELEASE OF THE TAX\nRETURNS. HERE'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY TO\nWOLF. >> I THINK THE COMMITMENT DONALD\nTRUMP HAS MADE IS ONCE THE ROUTINE AUDIT IS DONE HE'LL\nRELEASE THE TAX RETURNS IN TOTALITY AND NOT PARCH THEM OUT\nPIECE BY PIECE AS YOU MIGHT SUGGEST.\n>> THE QUESTION, WHY ISN'T HE LIVING UP TO THE MIKE PENCE\nSTANDARD? >> WELL, DONALD TRUMP MADE IT\nVERY CLEAR. HE HAS LIVED IN THE PUBLIC EYE A\nLONG TIME, IS FULLY TRANSPARENT ABOUT HIS FINANCIAL DEALINGS AS\nTHE LAW REQUIRES, IN HIS FEDERAL FILINGS, AND THOSE TAX RETURNS\nWILL BE OUT WHEN THAT ROUTINE AUDIT IS DONE.\n>> FULLY TRANSPARENT IN HIS FINANCIAL DEALINGS AS THE LAW\nREQUIRES, JASON, BUT NOT AS TRADITIONAL CAMPAIGNING\nREQUIRES. ARE THEY AVOIDING THIS QUESTION\nOUT THERE WHERE YOU ARE, OR ARE YOU ABLE TO GET CLOSE ENOUGH TO\nTHAT COMPLAIN TO PRESS CONSTANTLY ON TAX RETURNS?\n>> Reporter: LOOK, BE CLEAR. TRUMP, FOR HIS PART HARKS SAID\nREPEATEDLY CLINTON IS THE ONE NOT TRANSPARENT, NOT TRANSPARENT\nABOUT HER HEALTH. NOT TRANSPARENT ABOUT HER\nE-MAILS. BUT, LOOK, AS YOU KNOW, HE HAS\nTAKEN HEAT HIMSELF FOR NOT RELEASING HIS TAX RETURNS AND\nSAID REPEATEDLY HE'S NOT GOING TO DO IT BECAUSE HE'S UNDER IRS\nAUDIT, THOUGH THE IRS MADE IT CLEAR BECAUSE YOU'RE UNDER AUDIT\nTHAT DOES NOT PREVENT YOU FROM RELEASING RETURNS.\nWHEN YOU SPEAK TO FOLKS HERE, I HAVE TO SOME, SOME FEEL THIS IS\nIMPORTANT. IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF\nTRANSPARENCY FOR TRUMP TO DO THIS.\nPENCE HAS SAID REPEATEDLY THAT THIS IS NOT REALLY AN ISSUE WITH\nVOTERS AT LARGE, AND I HAVE TO SAY, IN SPEAKING TO A NUMBER OF\nFOLKS OUT HERE, EVEN THOUGH SOME SAY HE SHOULD RELEASE HIS TAX\nRETURNS, THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF FOLKS, TRUMP\nSUPPORTERS, WHO SAY THEY DON'T REALLY FEEL AS THOUGH IT'S\nIMPORTANT. MORE FOCUSED ON THINGS LIKE THE\nECONOMY, NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES, DEALING WITH THINGS LIKE\nTHAT, OR EVEN HEALTH CARE. SO I DON'T THINK THIS IS\nSOMETHING THAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN ULTIMATELY, ASHLEIGH,\nIS GOING TO BUDGE ON. IT'S NOT AN ISSUE THEY ARE GOING\nTO ADDRESS, EVEN THOUGH THE PRESS BRINGS IT UP.\nI WOULD NOT LOOK FOR DONALD TRUMP TO RELEASE TAX RETURNS\nANYTIME SOON. >> THE FOLKS IN THE ROOM MAY NOT\nCARE ABOUT THEM, BUT THE FOLKS IN THE BIG AMERICAN ROOM DO CARE\nABOUT THEM TO THE TUNE OF 74% OF VOTERS POLLED WANT TO SEE THEM.\nBREAK IT DOWN TO REPUBLICANS, MAYBE DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTER,\n62% OF REPUBLICANS WANT TO SEE THE TAX RETURNS.\nHOLD ON, JASON, BECAUSE THIS AND THAT AND THE TIT FOR TAT IS\nGOING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THESE CAMPAIGNS AND WHILE\nHILLARY CLINTON IS IN BED TRYING TO GET BETTER, PRESIDENT OBAMA\nAND HER DAUGHTER CHELSEA AND HUSBAND BILL ARE THE ONES WHO\nARE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE TO THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND TALK TO THE\nREAL PEOPLE OUT THERE AND DO SOME OF THAT WORK FOR HER, AND\nIN THAT EFFORT, THE HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS ALSO\nRELEASED AN AD, AND IT'S ANSWERING TO DONALD TRUMP SAYING\nTO HER THAT WHEN YOU CALL PEOPLE A BASKET OF DEPLORABLES, WELL\nHILLARY CLINTON'S AD IS SUGGESTING HERE'S WHAT YOU'VE\nCALLED PEOPLE. HAVE A LOOK. \u00e2\u0099\u00aa\n>> HOW STUPID ARE THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY?\n>> WE'RE BUILDING A WALL. HE'S A MEXICAN.\n>> YOU GOT TO SEE THIS GUY, AH -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SAID.\nAH -- I DON'T REMEMBER! >> YOU'RE LIVING IN POVERTY.\nYOUR SCHOOLS ARE NO GOOD. YOU HAVE NO JOBS.\n>> WHAT THE -- >> JEFF ZELENY, AS SHE GETS\nPREPARED TO HEAD BACK ON THE TRAIL, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, OR\nWHICH SHE'S WELL ENOUGH TO DO SO, HOW DO HER SURROGATES, THOSE\nCHIEF SURROGATES, PRESIDENT OBAMA, HER DAUGHTER, HER\nHUSBAND, HOW DO THEY TAKE THIS MESSAGE?\nBECAUSE THIS IS UGLY STUFF. >> NO DOUBT.\nAND THEY'RE DOING IT TODAY. SHE IS UP ON THE AIR IN\nBATTLEGROUND STATES, SOMETHING TRUMP IS NOT.\nYES, PROBABLY PREFER TO BE OUT CAMPAIGNING.\nIF THERE OR NOT, THAT AD IS RUNNING AND THEY'RE TRYING TO\nMAKE DNT'S OLD WORDS THE SOUND TRACK OF THIS CAMPAIGN.\nCHELSEA CLINTON HAS TWO EVENTS. PRESIDENT OBAMA MORE\nSIGNIFICANTLY THAN ANYONE DOING A SOLO EVENT IN PHILADELPHIA.\nGUESS WHY PHILADELPHIA? IT'S FOUR WEEKS FROM TODAY WHERE\nVOTER REGISTRATION ENDS. TRYING TO FIRE UP THAT OBAMA\nCOALITION, NOT AS EXCITED FOR HILLARY CLINTON AS IT WAS FOR\nHIM. WHY MICHELLE OBAMA IS GOING OUT\nON THE ROAD AS WELL ON FRIDAY. IT REALLY TAKE AS VILLAGE, TO\nUSE HER EXPRESSION, AND SHE'S TRYING TO USE THAT DEMOCRATIC\nVILLAGE TO SORT OF BUILD HER UP HERE, BUT THAT AD -- IS A\nCENTRAL SIGN YET AGAIN THAT DONALD TRUMP CAN SAY WHATEVER HE\nWANTS NOW. THE WORDS HE SAID UP TO THIS\nPOINT ARE REVERBERATING, AT LEAST THEY HOPE THEY WILL BE.\n>> JEFF ZELENY, KEEP AN EYE ON THINGS.\nIF YOU GET A BREAK ON THE DATA WE'LL BREAK IN AND COVER THAT.\nJASON CARROLL AS WELL DOING A JOB FOR US ON THE TRUMP CAMP.\nAPPRECIATE THAT. I WANT TO TALK MORE ABOUT THE\nWHOLE TRANSPARENCY THING, BECAUSE IT SPEAKS TO BOTH OF\nTHESE CAMPAIGNS AND I GOT THE THINK TANK FOR THIS.\nCNN POLITICS REPORTER STEPHEN WITH ME AND PROFESSOR IN\nPOLITICS EDITOR AT THE ROOT.COM JASON JOHNSON IS HERE AND FROM\nCHARLOTTESVILLE, VIRGINIA, DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR\nPOLITICS AT UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, LARRY SALVEBATOW WHO W\nAS THING OR TWO ABOUT POLLING FOR THE PRESIDENCY.\nMY COLLEAGUE ANDERSON KEEPER HAD A NICE EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH\nHILLARY CLINTON AS SHE WAS RECUPERATING BUT DIDN'T GO EASY\nON HER ON THE DELAY OF REVEALING THIS PNEUMONIA ISSUE.\nSPEAK WHAT'S YOU HAVE BEEN WRITING ABOUT, THE TRANSPARENCY\nPROBLEM. HAVE A LISTEN TO ANDERSON'S\nQUESTION. >> DOESN'T YOUR HANDLING -- OF\nTHIS, IN YOUR CAMPAIGNS, YOU KNOW, REFUSAL TO ACKNOWLEDGE\nWHAT HAPPENED UNTIL REALLY AFTER THAT VIDEO WAS CIRCULATED\nCONFIRM SUSPICION TO VOTERS YOU'RE NOT TRANSPARENT OR\nTRUSTWORTHY? >> OH, MY GOODNESS, ANDERSON.\nYOU KNOW, COMPARE EVERYTHING YOU KNOW ABOUT ME WITH MY OPPONENT.\nI THINK IT'S TIME HE MET THE SAME LEVEL OF DISCLOSURE THAT I\nHAVE FOR YEARS. YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT A MEDICAL\nREPORT ON ME THAT MEETS THE SAME STANDARD AS MITT ROMNEY AND\nBARACK OBAMA. DONALD TRUMP'S DOCTOR SAID HE'D\nBE THE HEALTHIEST PRESIDENT IN HISTORY.\nTHAT'S NOT EVEN SERIOUS. AND I'VE RELEASED NEARLY 40\nYEARS OF TAX RETURNS. HE HASN'T RELEASED ONE.\nTHIS IS A MAN WITH UNKNOWN NUMBERS, OF PARTNERS AND\nINVESTORS, WHO SAYS HE'S DOING 120 FOREIGN DEALS.\nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE TO KNOW WHAT HE'S UP TO AND WHAT HE\nIS HIDING. >> SO STEPHEN, THIS IS HARD\nSTUFF TO MEASURE, BUT IF ONE WOULD HAVE TO MEASURE IT, DOES\nDID ONLY GO THROUGH THE PRISM OF WHO YOUR GUY IS, OR CAN THIS BE\nMEASURED, CAMPAIGNED OUT GET TO WHO'S BEING LESS TRANSPARENT?\n>> ULTIMATELY UP TO THE CAMPAIGNS TO DISCLOSE.\nHILLARY CLINTON IS CORRECT. SHE HAS ISSUED MORE FINANCIAL\nINFORMATION THAN DONALD TRUMP, HAS ISSUED MORE MEDICAL\nINFORMATION THAN DONALD TRUMP. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS THAT,\nYOU KNOW, SHE'S NOT PERHAPS THE BEST MESSENGER FOR THAT MESSAGE.\nWE KNOW FROM THE POLLS AND HER OWN POLITICAL HISTORY VOTERS DO\nHAVE PROBLEMS WITH HER HONESTY. THEY BELIEVE SHE IS NOT SOMEONE\nTHAT ALWAYS COMES FORWARD AND DISCLOSES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.\nTHAT'S WHY IT'S A DIFFICULT POLITICAL ISSUE TO GAME OUT.\nYOU KNOW, IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THIS UNFORTUNATE HEALTH INCIDENT\nWITH HILLARY CLINTON, WE COULD BE HEADING INTO THIS ELECTION\nWITH A MEDICAL STATEMENT FROM HILLARY CLINTON, WHICH IS MORE\nTHAN A YEAR OLD, HER TAX RETURNS GRANTED, BUT A LAUGHABLY SORT OF\nCONCISE STATEMENT ON DONALD TRUMP'S MEDICAL HISTORY FROM HIS\nDOCTORS AND NO TAX RETURNS. THAT WOULD BE UNPRECEDENTED.\n>> SO, LARRY, I WANT TO BRING YOU IN ON THIS WITH NUMBERS, IF\nI CAN. I'M SURE YOU LISTENED IN TO THE\nINTERVIEW WITH OUR CORRESPONDENTS PRIOR TO THIS,\nAND YOU KNOW, JASON CARROLL NAILED IT.\nHE SAID, NO ONE IN THIS HALL REALLY SEEMS TO CARE ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP'S FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY.\nTHOSE TAX RETURNS, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE ACTUAL POLLING, I\nSAID IT BEFORE. I'M GOING TO SAY IT AGAIN.\n74% OF ALL VOTERS ASKED SAY THEY DO WANT TO SEE THOSE TAX RETURNS\nAND AMONG THOSE, 62% OF REPUBLICANS ASKED, SAID THEY\nWANT TO SEE THOSE TAX RETURNS. CAN DONALD TRUMP IGNORE THOSE\nWIDER NUMBERS? I DON'T THINK THAT MAN LIVES IN\nTHE BUBBLE OF HIS ARENA THAT LOVE HIM?\nCAN HE IGNORE OR BULLY OR CAMPAIGN HIS WAY OUT OF THOSE\nNUMBERS? >> WELL, HE MIGHT DO JUST THAT.\nTHE TRAGEDY IS THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS BROKEN A 40-YEAR PACT THAT\nCANDIDATES HAVE HAD WITH THE AMERICAN ELECTORATE TO RELEASE\nAT LEAST SOME OF THEIR TAX RETURNS, AND THOSE RETURNS ARE\nCRITICAL TO UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT A CANDIDATE HAS DONE, WHAT\nA CANDIDATE'S VALUES ARE. WHO A CANDIDATE, PERHAPS, IS\nINDEBTED TO. THERE ARE LOTS OF PIECES THAT\nCOME INTO FOCUS WHEN YOU HAVE THOSE TAX RETURNS.\nWHAT DEPRESSES ME, THAT 74% NUMBER, OR WHATEVER IT WAS,\nOUGHT TO BE 100%, BECAUSE SOONER OR LATER, THE REPUBLICANS ARE\nGOING TO FIND THEY'LL BE A DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE WHO WILL CITE\nTHE DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENT, PRECEDENT, AND WON'T RELEASE HIS\nOR HER TAX RETURNS. >> ALL RIGHT.\nSTAND BY, IF YOU WILL. WHEN WE COME BACK, JASON, I'M\nGOING TO ASK YOU SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE HEALTH REQUIREMENTS,\nAND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SAID.\nWE PUT IT TO THE CAMPAIGN TODAY ABOUT THAT DOCTOR'S LETTER THAT\nCAME FROM THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, SAYING THINGS LIKE, DONALD'S\nHEALTH IS ASTONISHINGLY EXCELLENT AND HE'D BE THE\nHEALTHIEST PERSON EVER ELECTED PRESIDENT.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE HAD A GOOD CHUCKLE OVER THAT.\nYOU SHOULD HEAR WHAT THE CAMPAIGN HAS TO SAY ABOUT ALL OF\nTHOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE LAUGHING.",

JOINING US FROM CLEVELAND,\nKYLE, WHO WORKS FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA\nCENTER FOR POLITICS. YOU GUYS ARE ALSO ANALYZING\nTHE ELECTORAL COLLEGE. ARE YOU ON THE SAME TRACK AS\nFOX NEWS IS? >> YEAH.\nWE DO THINK THAT CLINTON HAS GOT A LITTLE BIT OVER 270\nPRETTY SOLID ELECTORAL VOTES.\nTHERE IS AN ADDITIONAL GROUP OF 70 ELECTORAL VOTES WHERE\nCLINTON IS LEADING BUT WHERE TRUMP IS VERY COMPETITIVE.\nTHE STATE OF OHIO WHERE I AM RIGHT NOW IS VERY\nCOMPETITIVE. BUT I THINK CLINTON HAS A\nSMALL LEAD. FLORIDA, IOWA, NORTH\nCAROLINA WHICH MITT ROMNEY WON.\nI THINK IN ORDER TO WIN, TRUMP NEEDS TO PUT AWAY\nSTATES LIKE OHIO, FLORIDA, AND IOWA AND THEN START\nEATING INTO THE TRADITIONAL DEMOCRATIC STATES MAYBE A\nPENNSYLVANIA OR A WISCONSIN OR ONE OF THEM.\nBUT, SO FAR. >> HE SEEMS TO BE CLOSE IN\nWISCONSIN. I THINK IT'S 5.\n>> SURE. >> HE IS GOING TO NEW\nHAMPSHIRE LATER THIS WEEK. THAT'S ONLY 3.\nBUT, YOU KNOW, THREE COULD TELL THE TALE.\nI SEE IT THIS WAY. THAT THE FIRST DEBATE IS\nREALLY THIS YEAR GOING TO CHANGE PRETTY MUCH ALL THE\nPREVAILING WISDOM THERE IS IN PLACE BEFORE IT.\nAM I WRONG? >> WELL, SO I DO THINK THAT\nTHE ELECTORATE IS PRETTY STABLE.\nALTHOUGH WE DO SEE A LOT OF FLUCTUATIONS IN THE POLLS.\nSOMETIMES IT'S JUST A GUNGS OF THAT TRUMP HAS A GOOD\nWEEK SO REPUBLICANS GET EXCITED.\nCLINTON HAS A GOOD WEEK SO DEMOCRATS GET EXCITED.\nI THINK WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW IS SORT OF THE RACE IS\nKIND OF WHERE IT WAS RIGHT BEFORE THE CONVENTION.\nCLINTON HAS THIS SORT OF SMALL LEAD BUT IT'S A LEAD\nSORT OF AKIN TO WHAT OBAMA HAD IN 2012.\nTHAT'S ENOUGH BUT MAYBE A LITTLE TOO CLOSE FOR\nCOMFORT. >> LET ME PUT THIS FORTH\nBECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE THE MODEL OF PAST ELECTIONS\nHOLDS THIS TIME. I DON'T BELIEVE IT HOLDS.\n>> THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE FOR THAT.\n>> RIGHT. >> SO JUST TODAY WE HAD A\nPOLL JUST CAME OUT FROM THE \"BOSTON GLOBE\" SHOWING\nCLINTON ONLY UP IN THREE IN MAINE WHICH OBAMA WON BY 16.\nANOTHER POLL CAME OUT SHOWING THAT TRUMP WAS ONLY\nUP 6 IN TEXAS. ROMNEY WON TEXAS BY 16.\nSO THERE IS SOME WEIRD THINGS GOING ON OUT THERE.\n>> HERE'S THE REASON. HILLARY CLINTON IS A\nSUSPICIOUS CANDIDATE. THAT'S THE BEST WORD.\nI'M NOT SAYING THIS IN ANY CONDEMNATION OR ANY KIND OF\nIDEOLOGICAL WAY. MANY AMERICANS ARE\nSUSPICIOUS OF HER. OKAY?\nSO YOU DIDN'T HAVE THAT WITH GORE OR KERRY OR OBAMA.\nPEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE THEM OR LIKE THEIR POLICIES OR\nWHATEVER. THERE IS A PERSONAL\nSUSPICION SURROUNDING HILLARY CLINTON NOW THAT IS\nUNIQUE IN MY LIFETIME. REMEMBER, RICHARD NIXON\nDIDN'T HAVE THAT UNTIL AFTER HE WAS IN OFFICE.\nON THE OTHER SIDE, DONALD TRUMP IS LARGELY HATED OR\nLOVED, ALL RIGHT? BUT THOSE WHO LOVE HIM, THEY\nARE COMING OUT. TRUMP CAMPAIGN BELIEVES THEY\nWILL POLL PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN OUT BEFORE\nBECAUSE HE ENGENDERS THAT KIND OF EMOTION.\nEITHER LOATHING OR LOVE. AND THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nVOTE, IF IT ISN'T MOBILIZED AT THE SAME EXTENT THAT\nBARACK OBAMA SAW, IS -- WILL BRING HILLARY CLINTON DOWN 2\nOR 3 PERCENTAGE POINTS. THIS MODEL THIS YEAR IS\nTOTALLY DIFFERENT THAN ALL THE OTHER YEARS.\n>> WELL, DO I AGREE THAT IF THE DEMOCRATS HAVE A\nPROBLEM, I THINK IT IS AN ENTHUSIASM PROBLEM\nPARTICULARLY AMONGST THE YOUNGEST VOTERS WHICH IS THE\nMOST UNRELIABLE GROUP OF VOTERS AND ALMOST THE MOST\nDIVERSE. THINK ABOUT A STATE LIKE\nOHIO, THERE ARE A LOT OF BIG UNIVERSITIES IN OHIO.\nCLINTON IS GOING TO NEED OPTIMAL TURNOUT IN THOSE\nPLACES AND A LOT OF PLACES WHERE BERNIE SANDERS DID\nWELL IN THE PRIMARY. WE ALSO SEE THAT\nPARTICULARLY THE YOUNGEST VOTERS 18 TO 24, A LOT OF\nTHEM ARE SAYING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO SUPPORT GARY\nJOHNSON OR JILL STEIN. >> TICK OFF 10% JOHNSON.\n>> SURE. >> HILLARY CLINTON HAS A\nVERY GOOD GET OUT THE VOTE ORGANIZATION IN ALL OF THESE\nSTATES. >> RIGHT.\n>> WHEREAS TRUMP IS RELYING MORE ON HIS PERSONAL\nCHARISMA TO CARRY THE DAY. >> RIGHT.\n>> SO ON ELECTION DAY, IF TRUMP DOES WELL IN DEBATES,\nTHIS IS THE BIG CAVEAT. IF SHE HOLDS HER OWN WITH\nTRUMP, IS HE NOT GOING TO WIN.\n>> I AGREE. >> IF HE WINS, IF HE DEFEATS\nHER ON THE DEBATE ON POLICY, CAN'T CALL HER CROOKED\nHILLARY, CAN'T MAKE FUN OF HER PANTS SUITS.\nWHEN SHE STARTS COUGHING THROW WATER ON HER.\nTHAT WAS NOT GOOD. HE CANNOT DO THAT.\n>> AND BILL, ONE OTHER THING STILL A PRETTY BIG MAJORITY\nOF THE PUBLIC DOESN'T THINK THAT TRUMP IS QUALIFIED FOR\nTHE JOB. >> HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO\nPROVE THAT. >> THAT'S WHERE THE DEBATES\nCOME IN. THE SPEECH HE GAVE TONIGHT\nABOUT CHILD CARE POLICY. THAT IS A STEP HIS CAMPAIGN\nWAS TRYING TO TAKE. >> HE IS GOING TO DO ANOTHER\nONE THIS WEEK ON HIS ECONOMIC PLAN.\nIS HE READING OFF THE PROMPTER.\nWHOLE DIFFERENT BALLGAME WHEN YOU ARE TALKING THAN\nWHEN YOU ARE READING.

DID SHE LOSE SOME GROUND GAME TO\nTRUMP?

THEY'VE NOW FORMALLY ANNOUNCED\nIT WILL BE THURSDAY NIGHT IN GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA.\nTHE CAMPAIGN SAYS THEY'RE ACCEPTING RSVPs FOR THIS EVENT\nWITH SECRETARY CLINTON IN GREENSBORO.\nSO NOW WE OFFICIALLY KNOW HOW MUCH TIME HILLARY CLINTON HAS\nHAD TO TAKE OFF THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL BECAUSE OF THIS ILLNESS\nTHAT COST HER SO MUCH TROUBLE AT THE 9/11 MEMORIAL ON SUNDAY.\nHER DOWNTIME STARTED AFTER THAT ON SUNDAY NIGHT.\nIT'S GOING TO INCLUDE MONDAY, TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY.\nBUT NOW WE'RE TOLD BY THE CAMPAIGN OFFICIALLY SHE WILL BE\nBACK OUT THERE AS OF THURSDAY. SO THAT'S BRAND-NEW NEWS AS OF\nTONIGHT. ALSO TONIGHT THE LIBERTARIAN\nPARTY HAS JUST ANNOUNCED THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE THEIR PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATE ON THE BALLOT IN ALL 50 STATES.\nAND THAT MUST BE VERY EXCITING FOR THEM.\nONE PROBLEM IS WE DO NOT THINK IT IS NECESSARILY TRUE.\nTHEY HAVE MADE THAT ANNOUNCEMENT TONIGHT.\nTHERE IS ONE SPECIFIC REASON TO BE SKEPTICAL ABOUT THAT\nANNOUNCEMENT. WE'VE GOT THAT STORY COMING UP\nFOR YOU TONIGHT. IN TERMS OF OTHER THINGS WE'RE\nKEEPING AN EYE ON TONIGHT, THERE'S A LOT OF ANTICIPATION\nTHIS EVENING ABOUT A COVER STORY THAT \"NEWSWEEK\" MAGAZINE IS\nEXPECTED TO BE RUNNING AS OF TOMORROW.\nIT'S A COVER STORY ON DONALD TRUMP WRITTEN BY KIRK ICON WALD\nWHO IS SORT OF A MARQUIS NAME INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER DURING\nTHE COURSE OF HIS CAREER. HE'S FOCUSED ON INVESTIGATIVE\nREPORTING REGARDING BUSINESS ISSUES.\nHE'S DONE SEMINAL REPORTING ON WALL STREET CORRUPTION AND ENRON\nAND THE MEDICAL INDUSTRY AND INSURANCE COMPANIES.\nJUST AFTER 4:00 EASTERN TIME KURT EICHENWALD POSTED THIS, IF\nYOU KNOW INFO ON TRUMP'S MEDICAL CONDITION OR TAXES, E-MAIL THIS\nJUNK E-MAIL ADDRESS. I MUST KNOW WHO YOU ARE, BUT I\nWON'T TELL. GIVEN EICHENWALD'S HISTORY AS A\nREPORTER, THAT'S INTRIGUING. LOOKING FOR TIPS TO FURTHER HIS\nREPORTING. BUT THEN A FEW MINUTES LATER HE\nPOSTED THIS. MY BIG COVER STORY IN \"NEWSWEEK\"\nTHAT COULD CHANGE THE DIALOGUE ABOUT THIS ELECTION SEASON WOULD\nBE PUBLISHED ONLINE TOMORROW. NOW, KURT EICHENWALD HAS VERY\nIMPORTANT QUESTIONS CONCERNING DONALD TRUMP'S HEALTH RECORDS.\nHE ALSO TODAY POSTED THEN DELETED SOME VERY INFRAM MA TORY\nCLAIMS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S ALLEGED HEALTH HISTORY.\nTHERE WAS A LOT OF BUZZ AND SPECULATION THAT EICHENWALD AND\n\"NEWSWEEK\" WOULD HAVE SOMETHING TOMORROW CONCERNING DONALD\nTRUMP'S HEALTH. INSTEAD IT WON'T BE ABOUT\nTRUMP'S HEALTH, IT WILL BE ABOUT TRUMP'S BUSINESS DEALINGS.\nBUT UNTIL IT COMES OUT, WHICH SHOULD EITHER BE OVERNIGHT SOME\nTIME TONIGHT OR TOMORROW, WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE.\nBUT IF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WHO WORKS IN THE NEWS BUSINESS AND\nTHEIR PHONES START GOING OFF LIKE THE FINALE IN A REALLY BIG\nFIREWORKS DISPLAY AROUND 4:00, 5:00 TODAY, THAT'S WHY.\nANTICIPATION ABOUT THAT \"NEWSWEEK\" STORY.\nTHAT COVER STORY WILL PROBABLY BE OUT, I'M GUESSING BY DAWN\nTOMORROW AT THE LATEST. MY EXPECTATION IT WILL PROBABLY\nBE EARLIER THAN THAT. BUT WE SHALL SEE.\nON THIS ISSUE OF THE CANDIDATE'S HEALTH, THOUGH, PRESIDENT OBAMA\nGAVE A LONG, VERY ENERGETIC SPEECH TODAY IN PHILLY ON BEHALF\nOF HILLARY CLINTON. IT WAS KIND OF A HOT AND SWEATY\nDAY IN PHILLY. THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH WENT ON\nFOR A WHILE VERY ENTHUSIASTIC CROWD.\nLOTS OF APPLAUSE BREAKS. IT WAS ALSO A LONG SPEECH.\nBUT SURE ENOUGH AT THIS EVENT IN PHILLY, SOMEBODY FAINTED.\nAND BY NOW FOR BETTER OR WORSE, FAINTING IS A PHENOMENON AT THE\nCENTER OF OUR POLITICAL DIALOGUE.\nWHEN IT HAPPENED AT THIS SPEECH TODAY IN PHILLY, PRESIDENT OBAMA\nVERY CLEARLY HAD AN ACTION PLAN AND SOME CONSTRUCTIVE\nSUGGESTIONS IS FOR THE REST OF THE CROWD.\n>> DEMOCRACY WORKS, BUT HERE'S THE THING.\nHERE -- WE HAVE SOMEBODY WHO FAINTED.\nTHIS IS WHAT HAPPENS. THEY'LL BE OKAY.\nJUST GIVE THEM A LITTLE ROOM. EVERYBODY BEND THEIR KNEES ONE\nTIME. JUST DON'T LOCK YOUR KNEES.\nKEEP ON BENDING THEM A LITTLE BIT.\nWE'LL DO A LITTLE EXERCISE RIGHT NOW.\nEMS FOLKS, THEY'RE RIGHT IN FRONT, IF YOU CAN FIND SOMEBODY.\nDRINK SOME WATER. I LOVE YOU, TOO.\nBUT BEND YOUR KNEES. >> I LOVE THE WHOLE CROWD KIND\nOF BOBBING ALONG WITH HIM. PRESIDENT OBAMA SPEAKING TODAY\nIN PHILADELPHIA LEADING THE CROWD IN SOME ANTI-FAINTING\nEXERCISES. THIS IS ACTUALLY OVERALL PRETTY\nREMARKABLE CAMPAIGN APPEARANCE FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA TONIGHT,\nSOMETHING WE HAVEN'T QUITE SEEN YET FROM HIM.\nWE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE ON THAT COMING UP TONIGHT.\nON THIS HEALTH ISSUE, THOUGH, WE'VE ALSO GOT SOME STRANGE,\nEVEN KIND OF BAFFLING NEW REPORTING, NEW INFORMATION ABOUT\nTHE HEALTH RECORDS OR AT LEAST THE HEALTH INFORMATION WE'RE\nABOUT TO GET FROM OUR TWO PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES.\nBOTH OF THEM ARE IN A STRANGE, IF NOT UNPRECEDENTED, POSITION\nON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. THIS IS USUALLY THE LEAST\nCONTROVERSIAL THING IN MY CAMPAIGN.\nBUT THIS YEAR IT'S DIFFERENT. ON HILLARY CLINTON'S SIDE, IT'S\nDIFFERENT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE SHE HAD THAT HEALTH EPISODE IN\nPUBLIC ON SUNDAY AT THE 9/11 MEMORIAL.\nTODAY WILL BE HER SECOND DAY OFF THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL RESTING AND\nRECOVERING FROM WHAT HER CAMPAIGN SAYS WAS A PNEUMONIA\nDIAGNOSIS. AS I MENTIONED AT THE TOP OF THE\nSHOW, SHE'S NOW ANNOUNCED DISHTS'S NOW ANNOUNCED BY THE\nCAMPAIGN THAT SHE'LL BE BACK ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL BY THURSDAY\nNIGHT IN NORTH CAROLINA. SO IN TERMS OF HER MEDICAL\nRECORDS AND US EXPECTING ADDITIONAL MEDICAL INFORMATION\nFROM HER AT THIS POINT IN THE CAMPAIGN, I MEAN, THIS HAD BE A\nSECOND RELEASE OF MEDICAL RECORDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE\nCAMPAIGN AFTER SHE SAID SHE WOULDN'T RELEASE ANY FURTHER\nMEDICAL RECORDS BEYOND THE DOCTOR'S LETTER SHE PUT OUT LAST\nSUMMER, BUT SHE'S IN AN UNUSUAL POSITION TO REVISE HER EARLIER\nSTATEMENT. ESSENTIALLY IN A WAY THAT'S\nGOVERNED BY NECESSITY BECAUSE SHE HAD THAT INCIDENT IN PUBLIC\nON SUNDAY AFTERNOON. THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE\nCLINTON SIDE. ON THE TRUMP SIDE, HE IS ALSO IN\nA VERY UNUSUAL POSITION WHEN IT COMES TO HIS HEALTH BECAUSE HIS\nFORTHCOMING DISCLOSURE OF ADDITIONAL MEDICAL INFORMATION,\nTHAT'S NECESSITATED ON HIS SIDE MOSTLY BY THE FACT THAT THE\nINITIAL DOCUMENT HE PUT OUT TO ATTEST TO HIS HEALTH WAS SUCH A\nWEIRD DOCUMENT. >> I'VE BEEN THE PERSONAL\nPHYSICIAN OF MR. DONALD J. TRUMP SINCE 1980.\nHIS PREVIOUS POSITION WAS MY FATHER DR. JACOB BORNSTEIN.\nI'M PLEASED TO REPORT THAT MR. TRUMP HAS HAD NO SIGNIFICANT\nMEDICAL PROBLEM. HE'S HAD A RECENT COMPLETE EXAM\nTHAT SHOWED ONLY POSITIVE RESULTS.\nSENTENCE IS PROBABLY NOT RIGHT. BUT WRITTEN CORRECTLY.\nBUT I GOT A \"D\" IN GERMAN. HIS PULP IS 110/65 AND HIS\nLABORATORY TESTS ARE ASTONISHINGLY EXCELLENT.\nHIS PHYSICAL STRENGTH AND STAMINA ARE EXTRAORDINARY.\nIF ELECTED, I CAN SAY HE'LL BE THE HEALTHIEST INDIVIDUAL EVER\nELECTED TO THE PRESIDENCY. >> DR. BORNSTEIN, PHRASES LIKE\nASTONISHINGLY EXCELLENT SEEM A LITTLE BIT OVER THE TOP TO SOME\nPEOPLE. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?\nIS THAT THE WAY THAT YOU WRITE MOST OF YOUR MEDICAL LETTERS?\n>> NO, BUT FOR MR. TRUMP I WROTE THAT LETTER.\n>> THAT'S DONALD TRUMP'S GASTROENTEROLOGIST READING OUT\nLOUD PORTIONS OF THIS UNUSUAL LETTER THAT HE SIGNED HIS NAME\nTO WHICH REMAINS THE ONLY PUBLIC DOCUMENTATION THAT DONALD TRUMP\nHAS RELEASED TO DESCRIBE HIS OWN HEALTH STATUS.\nIT HAS BEEN WIDELY NOTED THAT PHRASES LIKE ASTONISHINGLY XENLT\nAND EXTRAORDINARY STRENGTH AND HIM BEING THE HEALTHIEST\nINDIVIDUAL EVER ELECTED TO THE PRESIDENCY, WIDELY NOTED, WIDELY\nLITIGATED. PHRASES LIKE THAT ARE WEIRD FOR\nA MEDICAL DOCUMENT LET ALONE A DOCUMENT SAYING THAT ALL OF HIS\nTEST RESULTS WERE POSITIVE. THAT'S NOT USUALLY A GOOD THING\nWHEN ALL YOUR TEST RESULTS ARE POSITIVE.\nBUT LOST IN THE DISCUSSION OF THAT DOCUMENT, I THINK, IT'S\nALSO WORTH NOTING, PARTICULARLY AT THIS TIME WHEN THERE'S SO\nMUCH RENEWED FOCUS ON THIS ISSUE, IT'S WORTH NOTING WHEN\nNBC NEWS WAS ABLE TO DO A FOLLOW-UP INTERVIEW, HE DIDN'T\nJUST EXPLAIN HIMSELF ABOUT THAT HYPERBOLIC AND SOMEWHAT\nUNPROFESSIONAL LANGUAGE, HE ALSO REALLY QUALIFIED AND DIALED BACK\nAND GOT MUCH LESS AMBITIOUS IN TERMS OF WHAT HE WAS WILLING TO\nSAY ABOUT HOW HEALTHY DONALD TRUMP IS.\n>> DO YOU HAVE ANY MEDICAL CONCERNS ABOUT HIM?\n>> MEDICAL CONCERNS? I GUESS YOU HAVE THE SAME\nAVERAGE MEDICAL CONCERNS YOU HAVE FOR A 70-YEAR-OLD MAN.\n>> THE ONLY OTHER QUESTION THAT I THINK PEOPLE ARE CURIOUS ABOUT\nIS HE WOULD BE THE MOST -- THE HEALTHIEST PERSON EVER TO TAKE\nOFFICE. >> WELL, I THINK MOST OF THE\nPRESIDENCY SINCE WOODROW WILSON WAS WALKING AROUND WITH AZ\nHEMORRHAGE IN HIS BRAIN AND EISENHOWER, ONE ANSWERED THE\nOTHER, WE HAVE NOT HAD VERY -- THESE PEOPLE ARE OLDER AND THEY\nDEVELOP ADULT ILLNESSES. I DON'T THINK HE'S THE\nHEALTHIEST PERSON EVER ELECTED. YOU COULD ELECT A 22-YEAR-OLD.\n>> HOW DO YOU KNOW HE WOULD BE IN THE BEST HEALTH OF ANY\nPRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES?\n>> I LIKED THAT SENTENCE. I LIKE THAT SENTENCE, TO BE\nQUITE HONEST WITH YOU. AND ALL THE REST OF THEM, WE'VE\nHAD EVERYTHING AS PRESIDENT. PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA AND PEOPLE\nWITH TUMORS. WE'VE HAD EVERYTHING AS\nPRESIDENT. WE'VE HAD PSYCHOTIC AND\nPARANOIDS AND WE'VE HAD ALL IN MY OWN LIFETIME.\nWE'VE HAD PLENTY OF VERY DISTURBED PEOPLE IN THERE AND\nTHEY'VE USUALLY BEEN FORTUNATE TO BE HELD IN CHECK.\n>> AND DO YOU THINK HE WOULD BE FIT TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE\nUNITED STATES? >> YES, I THINK HE WOULD BE FIT\nAS ALL THE REST. WHO IS FIT OUT ON THE STREET IN\nTHERE'S AN INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE OF DISEASE.\nTHE INCIDENCE OF DISEASE IS WHAT'S OUT THERE, THE PREVALENCE\nIS WHAT WALKS INTO THE OFFICE. WHO KNOWS?\n>> WHO KNOWS? HE'S AS FIT AS ANY OF US.\nI MEAN -- WHEN INTERVIEWED BY NBC NEWS, WHEN ASKED TO\nELABORATE ON HIS SORT OF OVER THE TOP, UNUSUAL LETTER\nATTESTING TO DONALD TRUMP'S SUPERHUMAN HEALTH, WHICH AGAIN\nAS OF THIS POINT IS ALL WE'VE GOT ABOUT TRUMP'S HEALTH, THE\nDOCTOR WHO WROTE THAT EVALUATION WAS NOT NEARLY AS MUCH OF A\nBOOSTER OF DONALD TRUMP'S HEALTH AS THE LETTER HAD MADE HIM SEEM.\nJUST ONE LAST PIECE OF THIS. IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT THE\nDOCTOR SAID HE WAS RUSHED INTO WRITING THAT LETTER, THAT IT WAS\nNOT PROOFREAD, THAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN ONLY GAVE HIM FIVE\nMINUTES TO WRITE IT. THEY HAD A CAR WAITING OUTSIDE\nWHILE HE COMPLETED IT. THE DOCTOR'S WIFE WHO WORKS IN\nTHE OFFICE RAISED THE PROSPECT THAT THAT WHOLE ASTONISHINGLY\nEXCELLENT LINE ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S HEALTH, THAT MIGHT HAVE\nACTUALLY BEEN MEANT AS A JOKE. >> THE LETTER DOES SOUND\nPECULIAR. I KNOW THERE WAS A PHYSICIAN ON\nTELEVISION ON ANOTHER NETWORK WHO WAS SAYING NO ONE WOULD SAY\nPOSITIVE RESULTS -- >> YOU KNOW WHAT?\n>> HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU HAVE TO SIT HERE IN FIVE MINUTES?\nAND I GOT FIVE MINUTES TO WRITE THAT LETTER.\n>> OKAY. AND --\n>> UNPROOFREAD. IT WAS NEVER PROOF READ.\nI HAD FIVE MINUTES TO SIT AT THAT DESK AND WRITE THAT LETTER\nWHILE THE DRIVER WAITED FOR",

JUST THAT ONE LITTLE SHOCKER AT\nTHE END OF WHAT HILLARY CLINTON SAID SHOULD REALLY SET EVERYBODY\nON EDGE. 120 FOREIGN DEALS.\nDEALS WITH WHO? I MEAN, HIS MOST LUCRATIVE REAL\nESTATE DEAL I THINK ASIDE FROM TRUMP TOWER IN NEW YORK CITY IS\n40 WALL STREET. WE DON'T KNOW WHO HE CO-OWNS 40\nWALL STREET WITH. I MEAN, THIS IS REALLY, REALLY\nBASIC STUFF AND IT SHOULD BE STARTLING TO PEOPLE THAT HE WILL\nNOT TELL US WHO HE CO-OWNS BUSINESSES WITH, WHO HE OWES HIS\nESTIMATED $650 MILLION TO, HIS BUSINESSES ARE CARRYING A LOT OF\nDEBT. HE'S DOING OVER 100 FOREIGN\nDEALS AND HE WANTS TO BE BOTH THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND THE\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE WORLD FOR THE UNITED STATES.\nIT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE AS FAR AS -- YOU KNOW, I MEAN, THE DIFFERENCE\nBETWEEN TELLING SOMEBODY YOU HAD PNEUMONIA ON SUNDAY INSTEAD OF\nFRIDAY IS NOT EVEN IN THE SAME LEAGUE REALLY.\n>> WELL, DAVID, WE DO KNOW THAT CLINTON DID RELEASE HER TAXES\nFOR THE PAST 40 YEARS. WE KNOW SHE TAKES BLOOD\nTHINNERS, THAT SHE HAD A CONCUSSION, THAT SHE TAKES\nTHYROID MEDICATION. SHE EVEN TALKED TO CNN ABOUT\nMONICA LEWINSKY. WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HIS\nMEDICAL HISTORY, HIS TAX RETURNS OR HIS MARRIAGE.\nDO YOU AGREE WITH ERROLL? >> WELL, I CERTAINLY AGREE THAT\nDONALD TRUMP HAS NOT BEEN AS TRANSPARENT ABOUT HIS HEALTH\nRECORDS, RIGHT? HIS DOCTOR RELEASED THAT LETTER\nTHAT EVERYONE HAS TALKED ABOUT THAT SAID HE'S THE HEALTHIEST\nINDIVIDUAL EVER HE LEEKTED TO THE PRESIDENCY WHICH I THINK IS\nALMOST CARTOONISH IN ITS DESCRIPTION OF DONALD TRUMP.\nDONALD TRUMP SHOULD LEASE MOR ROBUST AND MORE COMPLETE HEALTH\nRECORDS. SECRETARY CLINTON SHOULD RELEASE\nMORE ROBUST AND MORE COMPLETE HEALTH RECORDS IF THAT'S WHAT\nTHE PUBLIC DEMANDS. I THINK IT'S REASONABLE FOR THE\nPUBLIC TO DEMAND THAT WHEN ANYONE SEEKS THE OFFICE OF THE\nPRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES, COMMANDER IN CHIEF, LEADER OF\nTHE FREE WORLD, IF YOU WILL. THAT SAID, I THINK THE STANDARD\nHAS TO BE APPLIED FAIRLY BOTH TO SECRETARY CLINTON AND TO DONALD\nTRUMP, WHICH IT HASN'T SO FAR. I THINK GOING FORWARD IN THE\nFUTURE THE STANDARD CAN'T BE AGEIST, RIGHT?\nJUST BECAUSE SHE'S 69 AND HE'S 70 DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULD PUT\nEXTRA SCRUTINY ON THEM. IF THE OFFICE IS THAT IMPORTANT,\nWHICH IT IS, THEN GOING FORWARD IN THE FUTURE IN 2020 IF A MUCH\nYOUNGER CANDIDATE, SENATOR RUBIO, SENATOR CRUZ RUNS WE\nSHOULD DEMAND THE SAME AMOUNT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR HEALTH\nAS WELL. >> OKAY.\nSO ON THE SUBJECT OF MRS. CLINTON'S PNEUMONIA AND DONALD\nTRUMP'S HEALTH RECORDS, KE KELLYANNE CONWAY WAS ON AND THIS\nIS WHAT SHE SAID ABOUT IT. >> ALISYN, THIS IS WHAT I EXPECT\nFROM THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN. I REALLY DON'T EXPECT IT FROM\nJOURNALISTS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HILLARY\nCLINTON AND HER PNEUMONIA AND WHAT HAPPENED ON 9/11 WHICH WE\nALL SAW WITH OUR OWN TWO EYES. IT TAKES US ABOUT TEN WORDS TO\nGET TO DONALD TRUMP. HE HAD A PHYSICAL LAST WEEK.\nHE'LL RELEASE THEM PROBABLY THIS WEEK OR WHENEVER THE DOCTOR HAS\nTHE REPORT PREPARED. >> SO I WOULD SAY THAT KELLYANNE\nCONWAY DOES NOT AGREE WITH ERROLL OR DAVID AND SHE CAN'T\nBELIEVE THEY'RE SAYING SUCH THINGS.\n>> AND WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH HIM RELEASING WHATEVER\nINFORMATION HE'S GOING TO RELEASE, THESE NUMBERS FROM HIS\nPHYSICAL. PART OF THE INFORMATION IS IT\nDOESN'T TELL YOU MUCH. IT'S JUST A SNAPSHOT OF WHATEVER\nYOUR CHOLESTEROL LEVEL IS OR WHATEVER YOUR HEART RATE IS OR\nYOUR BLOOD PRESSURE. SO THAT'S NOT GOING TO, I THINK,\nGIVE A REALLY COMPLETE PICTURE. I THINK THE STANDARD SHOULD BE\nAS DAVID SAID FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST PEOPLE WHO ARE OVER 65,\nSHOULD BE WHAT JOHN McCAIN, WE SAW HIM DO IN 2008 WHERE PEOPLE\nREALLY HAD A VERY WIDE ACCESS, REPORTERS DID, TO HIS HISTORY OF\nMEDICAL RECORDS AND THEY WERE ABLE TO POUR THROUGH THEM.\nSO THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK WE PROBABLY WON'T SEE.\nWE'LL SEE WHAT HILLARY CLINTON RELEASES IN THE NEXT DAYS, BUT I\nTHINK -- GO AHEAD. >> HERE'S THE OTHER THING THAT I\nFIND INTERESTING. THAT DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO\nAPPEAR ON THE DR. OZ SHOW ON THURSDAY.\nI GUESS THIS WAS PRE-ARRANGED. HE MAY OR MAY NOT TALK ABOUT THE\nRESULTS OF HIS PHYSICAL. THIS IS WHAT DR. OZ SAID ABOUT\nMR. TRUMP'S APPEARANCE YESTERDAY.\n>> HE'S COMING ON THE SHOW, AND I -- YOU KNOW, I KNOW THAT THIS\nHAS BECOME A BIG ISSUE FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES.\nI'VE INVITED BOTH. I KNOW THAT BOTH CANDIDATES ARE\nTALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THEIR HEALTH ISSUES BUT BECAUSE IT'S\nCOME UP IN A BIG CHARGED TOPIC, I THINK IT MAKES SENSE FOR THEM\nTO TALK ABOUT IT. I'M NOT TRYING TO PRY OR PROBE,\nI'M TRYING TO HEAR WHAT'S GOING ON IN THEIR LIVES.\n>> ERROLL, IS THAT A GOOD FORUM FOR DONALD TRUMP TO TALK ABOUT\nHIS HEALTH? BY THE WAY, HIS DAUGHTER IVANKA\nIS GOING TO APPEAR WITH HIM ON THE DR. OZ SHOW.\n>> I DON'T THINK IT'S THE RIGHT FORUM.\nNO DISRESPECT TO DR. OZ WHO PROBABLY MAKES MORE ON THIS SHOW\nTHAN ALL OF US COMBINED BUT I THINK WE JUST SAW IN THE MOST\nRECENT COMMANDER IN CHIEF FORUM WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEONE WHO IS\nNOT AN EXPERIENCED INVESTIGATIVE OR POLITICAL REPORTER TAKES A\nWHACK AT TRYING TO SORT OF GET INFORMATION OUT OF PEOPLE WHO\nARE TRYING TO BE EVASIVE. AND POLITICIANS, ESPECIALLY WHEN\nTHE STAKES ARE HIGH AS THEY ARE RIGHT NOW, CAN BE QUITE EVASIVE.\nI WOULD NOT EXPECT DR. OZ TO ASK THE RIGHT KINDS OF QUESTIONS TO\nGET TO THE BOTTOM OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE.\nAND UNFORTUNATELY I WOULD EXPECT HIM TO GET STEAM ROLLED, TO HAVE\nA BUNCH OF UNCHALLENGED ASSERTIONS TO COME OUT OF THE\nMOUTH OF THE CANDIDATE AND THEN WE'RE LEFT WITH MORE CONFUSION\nAND LESS INFORMATION THAN EVER. I MEAN, I HOPE DR. OZ'S\nPRODUCERS ARE WATCHING THIS AND MAYBE KNOW THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE\nARE RELYING ON THEM TO CARRY SOME IMPORTANT WEIGHT FOR THE\nPUBLIC WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING SOME REALLY IMPORTANT CHOICES IN\nTHE NEXT 50 DAYS. >> SO, DAVID, I CAN HEAR TRUMP\nSUPPORTERS SAYING THINGS LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT, HILLARY CLINTON'S\nTHE ONE WHO GOT SICK ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND SHE GOT\nPNEUMONIA. DONALD TRUMP SEEMS TO BE GOING\nSTRONG. SO WHY ARE WE ALL MAKING SUCH A\nBIG DEAL OF HIM RELEASING HIS MEDICAL RECORDS?\n>> WELL, WE'RE MAKING A BIG DEAL OUT OF IT AGAIN BECAUSE OF WHAT\nWE'VE ALL BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS, THAT\nTHE POSITION OF PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS TOO IMPORTANT\nFOR THE PUBLIC NOT TO HAVE AN IDEA OF THIS PHYSICALLY AND\nMENTALLY FOR ANY OF THE CANDIDATES TO BE ABLE TO DO THE\nJOB OF COMMANDER IN CHIEF IF THEY'RE ELECTED.\nIN TERMS OF THE STANDARD BEING HELD TO SECRETARY CLINTON, THERE\nARE ANY NUMBER OF ISSUES WHERE YOU COULD CRITICIZE SECRETARY\nCLINTON ON THE ISSUE OF TRANSPARENCY.\nTHE WAY SHE TALKED ABOUT THE MISHANDLING OF HER E-MAILS, SOME\nOF THE ISSUES SURROUNDING THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nI HAPPEN TO THINK THE ISSUE OF HER PNEUMONIA IS RELATIVELY LOW\nDOWN ON THAT LIST. A LOT OF JOURNALISTS DISAGREE\nAND REASONABLE MINDS CAN DISAGREE.\nIF SHE GETS A DIAGNOSIS ON FRIDAY THAT SAYS SHE HAS\nPNEUMONIA AND MAKES A DECISION TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE DEBATE, TWO\nMONTHS BEFORE THAT SHE WANTS TO POWER THROUGH AND GO THROUGH THE\n9/11 MEMORIAL, SHE'S ENTITLED TO MAKE THAT DECISION.\nONCE SHE HAD THAT EPISODE AND SHE HAD TO TO GO CHELSEA\nCLINTON'S APARTMENT, YES, IT'S IMPORTANT TO DISCLOSE WHY.\nPEOPLE ARE ASKING AND THEY WANT TO KNOW.\nTHEY CAME OUT A LITTLE TOO LATE TO BE FULLY TRANS PARENT.\nTHEY FIRST SAID SHE WAS OVER HEATED BUT EVENTUALLY SAYING SHE\nHAD PNEUMONIA IF, IN FACT, THAT IS ALL THAT'S AT ISSUE HERE,\nTHEN I THINK THE LESSON LEARNED IS MORE TRANSPARENCY AND MOVE\nFORWARD. >> ALL RIGHT.\nNIA-MALIKA, YOU'RE GOING TO JOIN US NEXT HOUR.\n>>> STILL TO COME IN THE \"NEWSROOM,\" ACCUSATIONS FLY AND\nTEMPERS BOIL OVER AS DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON HEAD\nFOR THE HOME STRETCH.",

IN 2014 OBAMA COULDN'T HELP\nDEMOCRATS CAMPAIGN FOR REELECTION IN THE MIDTERM\nELECTIONS AND HE'S NOW BY SOME POLLS WELL OVER 50% BUT EVEN AT\n58% BUT SORT OF AROUND 52% 5, 4% APPROVAL.\nSO AND SO I THINK HE'S IN HIS FINAL DAYS MAKING THIS LAP,\nVICTORY LAP AND TAKING CREDIT FOR THINGS AS HE TRIES TO WORK\nTO ELECT HILLARY CLINTON AND HE'S HOPING IT'S GOING TO HELP\nHER OBVIOUSLY WITH SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE SORT OF UNDECIDED,\nDEFINITELY WILL OPPOSE TRUMP BUT DON'T KNOW IF THEY'LL TURN OUT\nFOR HILLARY TO TELL THEM THINGS ARE BETTER THAN THEY SOUND.\nNO TRUMP SUPPORTER WILL EVER LISTEN TO A WORD HE SAYS.\nTHEY ALL THINK THE COUNTRY IS ON A TERRIBLE TRACK.\nBUT HE'S HOPING THERE ARE SOME INDEPENDENTS LEFT OR CENTRIST\nLEAN EITHER WAY VOTERS WHO ARE SKEPTICAL OF HILLARY BUT MAYBE\nTHEY WON'T COME AROUND ON ELECTION DAY AND HE CAN CONVINCE\nTHEM THINGS ARE GOOD ENOUGH AND SHE CAN CONTINUE WHAT HE'S DONE.\n>> ALL RIGHT. A. B. AND HILARY, KAYLEIGH, BILL\nAND S.E, THANK YOU. >>> COMING UP NEXT, HILLARY\nCLINTON IS NOT BACKING OFF HER COMMENTS THAT AT LEAST SOME OF\nDONALD TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS ARE RACIST, SEXIST AND XENOPHOBIC.\nMY NEXT GUEST SAYS HE HAS PROOF IN HIS INBOX.\nSTAY HERE. >>> CRITICS HAVE CALLED OUT\nHILLARY CLINTON FOR BEING POLITICALLY INCORRECT BUT SHE\nWASN'T WRONG, THEY SAY, WHEN SHE DESCRIBED HALF OF DONALD TRUMP'S\nSUPPORTERS AS BELONGING IN A BASKET OF DEPLORABLES.\nTRUMP'S CAMPAIGN DEMANDED A FULL APOLOGY FROM THE FORMER\nSECRETARY OF STATE AND MY NEXT GUEST SAYS THERE'S NO WAY TO\nQUANTIFY HOW MANY TRUMP SUPPORTERS FIT THIS DEPLORABLE\nDESCRIPTION BUT HE SAYS HE KNOWS THEY'RE OUT THERE BECAUSE HE HAS\nHEARD FROM THEM PERSONALLY. HE IS HENRY GOMEZ, POLITICS\nWRITER FOR CLEVELAND.COM. HENRY, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR\nBEING WITH ME. WE ALL READ YOUR PIECE THIS\nMORNING. SO LISTEN, WE ALL KNOW BEING A\nJOURNALIST -- I DON'T GET PRETTY TWEETS AND COMMENTS ON MY\nINSTAGRAM SO I FEEL YOU BUT YOU SAID IN WHAT THE LAST YEAR THAT\nYOU HAVE -- IT'S BEEN HORRENDOUS, THE COMMENTS YOU'VE\nBEEN GETTING, WHY? >> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.\nIT'S INTENSIFIED. I'VE BEEN REPORTING AND WRITING\nFOR 15 YEARS AND MY NAME APPEARS WITH ALL OF MY STORIES BUT I'VE\nNOTICED AN UPTICK COVERING THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, COVERING\nDONALD TRUMP AND THE E-MAILS THAT I'M GETTING, THE TWEETS I'M\nGETTING ARE TAKING ON A TONE -- THEY'RE PARROTING A LOT OF\nDONALD TRUMP'S GREATEST HITS, I'VE HAD PEOPLE TELL ME I SHOULD\nBE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL.\nI HAD A READER TELL ME I SHOULD BE DISQUALIFIED FROM COVERING\nTHE ELECTION BECAUSE OF MY ETHNICITY WHICH MIRRORS WHAT\nDONALD TRUMP SAID ABOUT THE JUDGE WITH THE UNIVERSITY CASE.\nAND A LOT OF THEM ADMIT THEY ARE TRUMP SUPPORTERS AND THEY ARE\nUSING HIS LANGUAGE AND BORROWING FROM THE SAME THINGS HE'S\nSAYING. >> AND YOU THINK THIS IS BECAUSE\nYOUR LAST NAME IS GOMEZ? >> IT'S OUT THERE ON MY BYLINE\nAND THEY HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING THIS OTHER THAN MY LAST NAME.\nI AM OF MEXICAN HERITAGE, I'M ALSO OF ITALIAN, GERMAN, AND\nIRISH HERITAGE BUT IT'S GOMEZ THAT APPEARS IN THE PAPER AND\nTHE E-MAILS AND TWEETS EMPHASIZE THE LAST NAME, THEY EMPHASIZE\nGOMEZ, THEY SAY I SHOULD GO BACK, MEAN DOG BACK TO MEXICO.\nSO IS IT TRUE I HAVE ANCESTORS FROM MEXICO, I'M PROUD OF THAT\nFACT. BUT THAT'S THE THING READERS ARE\nFIXING ON. >> WHICH MAKES IT A CHALLENGE,\nAS YOU DESCRIBED IN YOUR PIECE, OF COVERING THIS ELECTION.\nLET ME QUOTE YOU. \"IT STRIKES ME THAT TRUMP\nWHETHER HE MEANS TO OR NOT HAS FOSTER ADD HOSTILE MOMENT IN HIS\nPOLITICS WHEN HIS SUPPORTERS FEEL ENTITLED TO RACIALLY\nDENIGRATE OTHERS, SADLY, SIMPLY BEING A GOMEZ IS ENOUGH TO MAKE\nYOU A TARGET.\" LAST QUESTION, HENRY.\nHOW DO YOU THINK THIS ELECTION HAS CHANGED RACE RELATIONS IN\nAMERICA? >> WELL, I THINK YOU NAILED IT\nRIGHT THERE, HIS SUPPORTERS MAY HAVE FELT THIS WAY ALL ALONG BUT\nBECAUSE OF THE THINGS DONALD TRUMP IS SAYING THEY FEEL\nEMPOWERED AND EMBOLDENED TO SAY THIS OUT LOUD OR ATTACK\nSOMEBODY. IT'S NOT JUST REPORTERS, IT'S\nOTHERS, I FEEL THAT'S DIFFERENT. I COVERED THE ELECTION FOUR\nYEARS AGO AND NEVER RECEIVED THIS LEVEL OF VITRIOL FROM MY\nREADERS. THAT'S THE ONE THING THAT HAS\nCHANGED THIS YEAR AND I WONDER IF IT'S SOMETHING WE'LL SEE FOR\nYEARS TO COME IN PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS.\n>> FROM JOURNALIST TO JOURNALIST, I'M SORRY BUT KEEP\nCOVERING THIS ELECTION. HARRY GOMEZ WITH CLEVELAND.COM.\n>>> COMING UP NEXT, THE TOP EDITOR OF THE \"NEW YORK TIMES\"\nSAYS HE WOULD BE WILLING TO GO TO JAIL IF HE COULD GET HIS HAND\nON DONALD TRUMP'S TAXES AND",
