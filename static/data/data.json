JAKE TAPPER JUST SET DOWN NEXT\nTO ME. YOU HAVE A LETTER IN YOUR HANDS\nFROM THE DIRECTOR OF THE FBI IN THE WAKE OF THIS REOPENING OF\nTHE THIS REVIEW OF THE E-MAILS REGARDING HILLARY CLINTON.\nREAD THE LETTER. >> IT'S SHOCKING NEWS.\nIT'S FROM THE DIRECTOR OF THE FBI TO ALL OF THE SAME\nREPUBLICAN CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEES ON THE HOUSE AND\nSENATE ABOUT THE INFORMATION THAT THEY'VE BEEN LOOKING AT IN\nANT ANTHO\nANTHONY COMPUTER, WE'RE STICKING WITH OUR ORIGINAL ASSESSMENT.\n>> NOT CRIMINAL. >> NO CRIMINAL ACTS TOOK PLACE.\nOBVIOUSLY HE ALSO SAID THE WAY HILLARY CLINTON AND HER STAFF\nHANDLED THE INFORMATION WAS EXTREMELY CARELESS.\nTHE HEADLINE IS NOTHING NEW HERE CHANGED OUR CONCLUSION.\nDEAR MR. CHAIRMAN, I WRITE TO SUPPLEMENT NIGHT OCTOBER 28th\nLETTER THAT NOTIFIED YOU THE FBI WOULD BE TAKING ADDITIONAL\nINVESTIGATIVE STEPS WITH RESPECT TO FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE\nCLINTON'S USE OF A PERSONAL E-MAIL SERVER SINCE MY LETTER\nTHE TEAM HAS BEEN WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK TO PROCESS AND REVIEW\nA LARGE VOLUME OF E-MAILS FROM A DEVICE CONTAINED IN RELATION TO\nA UNRELATED CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION, ANTHONY WEINER.\nWE REVIEWED ALL OF THE INFORMATION TO AND FROM HILLARY\nCLINTON WHILE SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE.\nWE HAVE NOT CHANGED OUR CONCLUSIONS THAT WE EXPRESSED IN\nJULY WITH RESPECT TO SECRETARY CLINTON, THAT NONE OF THE ACTS\nWERE CRIMINAL AND VERY GRATEFUL TO THE PROFESSIONALS AT THE FBI\nFOR DOING AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF HIGH QUALITY WORK IN A\nSHORT PERIOD OF TIME SINCERELY YOURS, JAMES COMEY.\n>> WE WERE ON AIR TWO FRIDAYS AGO, THE LETTER TO MEMBERS OF\nCONGRESS AND TO LEADERS SAYING WE'RE GOING BACK AND LOOKING,\nSHE'S BEEN UNDER HUGE, HUGE CRITICISM.\nDEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN FURIOUS WITH COMEY WHICH HAS BEEN A FLIP-FLOP\nFROM EARLIER IN THE SUMMER. WHAT INFLUENCE -- WE'RE TWO DAYS\nOUT. HOW WILL THIS IMPACT WHAT\nHAPPENS TUESDAY? >> IT'S HARD TO SAY.\nTWO FRIDAYS AGO THE OCTOBER 28th LETTER, THE RACE WAS ALREADY\nTIGHTENING BUT IT'S HARD TO CONCLUDE ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE\nFACT IT IT REALLY HURT SECRETARY CLINTON AND CLOUD HURT HER.\nA LOT OF DEMOCRATS BELIEVE THAT WHAT IT DID IS RE-REPUBLICANS\nWERE WERE LEANING TOWARDS HILLARY CLINTON, IT DROVE THEM\nBACK INTO DONALD TRUMP'S CAMP WHEN HE HAS BEEN MORE\nDISCIPLINED WITH HIS MESSAGE, STICKING TO THE TELEPROMPTER AND\nPHONE HAVING BEEN WRENCHED AWAY BY KELLYANNE CONWAY SO HE'S NOT\nTWEETING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.\nTHAT SAYS BASICALLY THE REMEMBER, NEVER MIND, FORGET I\nSAID THAT, WE'RE GOING BACK TO WHAT WE SAID.\n>> I THOUGHT COMEY WASN'T GOING TO SAY ANYTHING -- WE THOUGHT IT\nWOULD TAKE SO MUCH LONGER. >> THE GUIDANCE WE GOT IS THEY\nWERE GOING TO REVIEW THE MATERIALS BUT THAT IT MIGHT TAKE\nWEEKS OR MONTHS UNTIL THEY REVIEWED ALL MATERIALS.\nOBVIOUSLY THERE WAS A CLOUD OVER SECRETARY CLINTON'S HEAD HERE,\nWHAT ARE THEY GOING TO FIND? WHAT ARE THE NEW MATERIALS AND\nTHAT CLOUD HAS CERTAINLY HURT HER WITH VOTERS.\nNOW WE HAVE JAMES COMEY SAYING WE REVIEWED IT AND OUR\nCONCLUSION IS THE SAME. NOT TO SAY WE DIDN'T FIND\nANYTHING IN OR INAPPROPRIATELY FORWARDED.\nIT IS JUST THIS CONCLUSION WE REACHED BACK THEN, WE STILL\nBELIEVE THE SAME THING, THERE IS NO PROSECUTOR, NO REASONABLE\nPROSECUTOR THAT WOULD TAKE THIS CASE.\n>> THIS IS A HUGE DEAL. STAY WITH ME QUICKLY, I WANT TO\nGO TO JEFF ZELENY THERE AT THE CLINTON EVENT IN OHIO.\nWHAT SORT OF A RESPONSE HAVE YOU GOTTEN FROM THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN, JEFF? >> Reporter: BROOKE, HILLARY\nCLINTON IS FLYING HERE TO CLEVELAND AS WE SPEAK.\nWE HAVE NO DIRECT REACTION FROM HER BUT HER NATIONAL PRESS\nSECRETARY BRIAN FALLON TWEETED THIS, WE WERE ALWAYS CONFIDENT\nNOTHING WOULD CAUSE THE JULY DECISION TO BE REVISITED.\nNOW DIRECTOR COMEY HAS CONFIRMED IT.\nTHAT IS THE EARLY REACTION FROM THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN.\nOBVIOUSLY THEY VIEW THIS AS WELCOME NEWS AND GOOD NEWS HERE.\nOF COURSE, THEY HAVE BEEN VERY CRITICAL OF THE FBI DIRECTOR'S\nDECISION TO JUMP IN THE FRAY A LITTLE MORE THAN A WEEK AGO\nFRIDAY, WHEN THAT BOMBSHELL REALLY DID CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY\nOF THIS RACE. NOW THEY ARE WONDERING OF\nCOURSE, IF THEY CERTAINLY CAN'T UNDO THAT.\nBUT THEY ARE CERTAINLY HAPPY TO SEE THIS LETTER COMING OUT AND\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS IN BROOKLYN, JUST\nLEARNING THIS AS WE ARE AND THEY ARE GOING TO GET THE WORD OUT\nHERE. YOU CAN EXPECT DEMOCRATIC\nSURROGATES AND HILLARY CLINTON HERSELF, I WOULD EXPECT WOULD\nADDRESS THIS HERE IN CLEVELAND. THIS IS COMING RIGHT BEFORE\nTUESDAY AND SEVERAL STATES WHERE EARLY VOTING IS NOT GOING ON.\nPENNSYLVANIA BEING ONE AND MICHIGAN BEING ONE.\nUNCLEAR IF IT CAN UNDO ALL OF THE POLITICAL DAMAGE, IF YOU\nWILL OTHER THE LAST WEEK OR SO. THEY CERTAINLY VIEW THIS AS\nWELCOME NEWS TODAY. WHEN HILLARY CLINTON TAKES THE\nSTAGE BEHIND ME HERE WITH LeBRON JAMES, I WOULD BE VERY SURPRISED\nIF SHE DID NOT MENTION THIS LETTER FROM DIRECTOR COMEY.\n>> THANK YOU SO MUCH. LYNN IS SITTING NEXT TO US AND\nJAMES TAPPER, IT'S AN I TOLD YOU SO FROM THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN.\nBUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDO EARLY VOTES ALREADY CAST.\n>> IT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING TO SAY THE LEAST.\nTHERE ARE SOME STATES THAT HAVE NO EARLY VOTING IN PARTICULAR\nAND IMPORTANT IN THIS CASE, PENNSYLVANIA, WHICH IS A STATE\nTHAT THEY NEED, THAT THE CLINTON PEOPLE NEED TO KEEP THAT 270\nNUMBER IN MIND. I THINK WHEN WE DO ALL OF THE\nPOSTMORTEMS, THIS LATE DECISION FOR COMEY.\n>> ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON. >> BETTER THAN NOTHING BUT JUST\nTO REVISIT THOSE FEW WEEKS AGO WHEN HE STARTED UP, IF THIS\nREVIEW COULD HAVE BEEN DONE THIS QUICKLY, IT ADDS TO THE CRITICS\nTHAT SAY YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID ANYTHING AT ALL UNTIL YOU KNOW.\nPOSTMORTEM ASIDE, THE NUMBER OF UNDECIDED SWING VOTERS IS\nSOMETHING THAT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS IN BETTER SHAPE TO\nKNOW PROBABLY THAN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WHICH MAY MEAN THIS\nEXCURSION INTO MINNESOTA MIGHT BE A FEW HOURS THAT THEY NEEDED\nSOMEPLACE ELSE. >> CAN I JUST SAY, TWO DAYS WE\nALWAYS LIKE TO SAY TWO DAYS IS A LIFETIME IN POLITICS.\nIT ACTUALLY TAKES MORE THAN TWO DAYS FOR SOMETHING TO REALLY\nSEEP INTO THE BLOODSTREAM. THERE ARE GOING TO BE A LOT OF\nPEOPLE WHO GO TO POLLS ON TUESDAY WHO DON'T KNOW ABOUT\nTHIS LETTER, EVEN IF IT'S COVERED FROM NOW UNTIL THEN BY\nTHE MEDIA. PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST -- IT'S A\nSUNDAY AND PEOPLE ARE OUTSIDE WATCHING THE FOOTBALL GAME AND\nPLAYING WITH KIDS AND WORKING, DOUBLE SHIFT, PEOPLE WHO AREN'T\nGOING TO LEARN ABOUT THIS. IF YOU WANT TO GET SOMETHING OUT\nIN POLITICS GENERALLY SPEAKING AND COMEY DOES NOT OPERATE\nACCORDING TO POLITICS OR POLITICAL SCHEDULE, IF YOU WANT\nTO GET SOMETHING OUT, YOU NEED AT LEAST A WEEK REALLY AND BARE\nMINIMUM FOUR OR FIVE DAYS. >> HE HAVE EVAN PEREZ ON THE\nPHONE AND EVERYONE ASSUMED WE WOULD HEAR NOTHING FROM JAMES\nCOMEY OF ALL TIMES ON AP SUNDAY BEFORE ELECTION DAY.\nWHAT IS YOUR REACTION? >> WELL, WHAT WE WERE TOLD BY\nTHE FBI, DON'T EXPECT US TO PROVIDE ANY PIECEMEAL UPDATES,\nWE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE WHEN WE HAVE A CONCLUSION, WHEN\nWE KNOW WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH AND KNOW WHAT IS ON THESE\nE-MAILS AND BEEN ABLE TO ASSESS THEM.\nTHAT IS IN KEEPING WITH WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE IT APPEARS THAT\nWHAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING IS FRANKLY WORKING 24/7, TRYING TO\nFIGURE OUT E-MAILS AND MAKE SURE THEY LAND -- TO VERIFY AND\nPREPARE THEM TO BEFORE AND AGAIN, YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK AT\nTHOSE AGAIN AND NARROW DOWN, FOCUS ON THE ONES THAT YOU HAVE\nNOT. THAT IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED.\nWE WERE TOLD INITIALLY IT WOULD BE A COUPLE OF DAYS TO AT LEAST\nSEPARATE THE E-MAILS THAT THEY HAVE NOT HAVE TO LOOK AGAIN,\nTHAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT, WE KNEW THEY WERE\nBUILDING -- TALKED WITH JUST TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN GO THROUGH\nCAN KEY WORD SEARCHES AND NARROW DOWN TO EXAMINE MORE CAREFULLY.\nTHAT APPEARS -- TO BE WHAT HAPPENED HERE.\nTO BE HONEST, WE THOUGHT THIS WOULD TAKE A LOT LONGER, WEEKS.\nTHE DANGER FOR THE FBI, THIS MIGHT NOT BE THE LAST OF IT.\nSOMEWHERE, SOMEWHERE ELSE THERE MIGHT BE SOME E-MAILS AND THEY\nLIVE SOMEWHERE ELSE THAT WE'LL BE BACK HERE AGAIN IN TWO\nMONTHS, THREE MONTHS, A YEAR, THAT'S ALWAYS THE DANGER WITH\nE-MAILS. >> THIS IS STUNNING, I'M\nLISTENING TO YOU, WATCHING THE TRUMP PLANE, AS HE'S ABOUT TO\nSPEAK TO THE CROWD IN MINNEAPOLIS AND RIGHT SIDE OF\nTHE SCREEN WE'RE WAITING FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA, WE JUST SAW HIM\nGO FROM MARINE ONE, AIR FORCE ONE.\nALL OF THIS AS NEWS FROM THE FBI DIRECTOR SHOULD START TO SWIRL,\nLETTERS TO CONGRESS SAYING ULTIMATE CONCLUSION WITH WHAT WE\nREACHED A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO WITH REGARD TO HILLARY CLINTON'S\nE-MAIL PRIVATE E-MAIL INVESTIGATION.\nLET ME GO TO I. YOU'RE HEARING ALL OF THIS FOR\nTHE FIRST TIME. YOUR RESPONSE?\n>> AS YOU SAID, THIS IS GOING TO SHAPE UP TO BE AN I TOLD YOU SO\nFOR DEMOCRATS. THEY HAVE A CASE TO MAKE THAT\nCOMEY COULD HAVE WAITED UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION, IF THERE WAS\nNOTHING TO SEE HERE, WHY DID HE HAVE TO DO THIS A WEEK BEFORE\nTHE ELECTION AND POTENTIALLY INFLUENCE THE ELECTION.\nIF CLINTON LOSES THIS WILL BE A SOURCE OF CONTROVERSY, UNENDING,\nAT THE SAME TIME, BROOKE, I WOULD SAY COMEY HAS AN ARGUMENT\nTO MAKE, IF IT'S ACCURATE THAT IT WAS TWO THURSDAYS AGO THIS\nLANDED ON HIS DESK AND TWO FRIDAYS AGO THAT HE ISSUED THAT\nFIRST LETTER TO CONGRESS, I THINK HE HAS AN ARGUMENT TO MAKE\nTHAT HE WAS TRYING NOT TO PUT HIS THUMB ON SCALE BY NOTIFYING\nCONGRESS IN REAL TIME RATHER THAN WAITING UNTIL AFTER THE\nELECTION. >> JAY?\n>> I THINK PEOPLE HERE WILL BE REALLY ANGRY, THE SENATE\nCANDIDATES IN FLORIDA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE WHERE YOU SAW THE\nPOLLS TIGHTEN IN THE LAST WEEKS BECAUSE OF THIS COMEY LETTER AND\nNOW THEY ARE BOTH TOSS-UP STATES AND REALLY CLOSE.\nSO HASSAN THE GOVERNOR OF NEW HAMPSHIRE RUNNING AGAINST KELLY\nAYOTTE AND PATRICK MURPHY RUNNING AGAINST RUBIO, THESE ARE\nWHO PEOPLE WHO WERE RIDING THE COAT TAILS OF HILLARY CLINTON\nUNTIL THE COMEY LETTER, FIRST LETTER.\nNOW THEY ARE FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES IN THESE RACES IT'S THE\nDOWN BALLOT EFFECT CAN'T BE UNDERESTIMATED HERE.\n>> LET'S TAKE A BREATH AND LET ME -- IF YOU'RE JUST JOINING US,\nWE'RE LIVE IN WASHINGTON REPORTING NOW ON MAJOR NEWS AS\nWE WATCH ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT CANDIDATES, YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE\nDONALD TRUMP SPEAKING TO A CROWD IN MINNESOTA, WE'RE WAITING FOR\nTHE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IN FLORIDA, ALL THE WHILE\nMAJOR NEWS JUST DROPPED. WE HAVE THIS LETTER FROM THE FBI\nDIRECTOR, JAMES COMEY TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ESSENTIALLY SAYING\nTHEY ARE STANDING BY THEIR FINDINGS FROM SEVERAL MONTHS AGO\nWITH REGARD TO HILLARY CLINTON'S PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER.\nTHAT ULTIMATE CONCLUSION WAS THAT THAT WAS NOT CRIMINAL.\nBUT THE QUESTION REMAINS, WHEN THIS NEWS INITIALLY BROKE, HE\nWAS TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT THE E-MAILS ON ANTHONY WEINER'S\nLAPTOP, THAT DIDN'T NECESSARILY HELP HILLARY CLINTON ESPECIALLY\nWITH ALL OF THESE EARLY VOTES THAT HAVE BEEN CAST OVER THE\nLAST WEEK OR SO. NOW YOU HAVE THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN ESSENTIALLY ABLE TO SAY WE TOLD YOU SO, WE WILL HEAR HOW\nSHE RESPONDS TO THAT WHEN SHE SPEAKS IF THE PRESIDENT TOUCHES\nIT WHEN HE SPEAKS IN FLORIDA. AND HOW DONALD TRUMP RESPONDS.\nTHIS IS SOMETHING THAT HE'S GRABBED ON TO AND STAYED ON\nMESSAGE BEYOND TALKING ABOUT THOSE RISING OBAMA CARE\nPREMIUMS, THIS HAS BEEN THE OTHER SIGNIFICANT NARRATIVE FROM\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN TO BE ABLE TO SAY IF YOU ELECT HER, YOU'LL\nHAVE YEARS OF DRAMA AND INVESTIGATION AND REMINDING\nEVERYONE, YOU KNOW, OF WHAT THE FBI WAS LOOKING INTO.\n>> CARL BERN STEIN IS ON THE PHONE WITH ME AND HAS WRITTEN\nTHE BOOK ON HILLARY CLINTON AND THE CLINTONS, CARL BURNSTEIN,\nYOU HAVE SAID THAT THE E-MAIL ISSUE WOULD COME BACK TO HAUNT\nHER BUT NOW YOU HAVE THE DIRECTOR SAYING HE'S STANDING BY\nHIS INITIAL CONCLUSION. >> HE'S STANDING BY HIS INITIAL\nCONCLUSIONS BUT IT DEFLATES", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1478467644494.1478464475526.316903e5-f54c-4037-b682-4fb12c3bcef5.segment2.thumb.jpg", "channel": "202"}, {"start": 1543562, "length": 254787.0, "end": 1798349, "date": 1478466285498, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1478466281052.cd6bbc2e-b888-4f1e-8cd3-a04853f6031a.mp4#t=1543.56,1798.35", "text": "BREAKING NEWS.\n>>> WELCOME TO THE \"LEAD.\" I'M JAKE TAPPER.\nWE HAVE HUGE BREAKING NEWS THIS SUNDAY AFTERNOON HERE IN\nWASHINGTON, D.C. TWO DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION,\nFBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY HAS YET AGAIN WEIGHED IN ON THE HILLARY\nCLINTON E-MAIL SERVER INVESTIGATION.\nTODAY, IN A LETTER TO CONGRESS, COMEY SAID THAT THE FBI HAS NOT\nFOUND ANYTHING IN THOSE NEW E-MAILS DISCOVERED THAT WOULD\nCHANGE THEIR CONCLUSIONS REACHED IN JULY.\nHERE'S WHAT COMEY HAD TO SAY BACK THEN IN JULY.\n>> ALTHOUGH WE DID NOT FIND CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT SECRETARY\nCLINTON OR HER COLLEAGUES INTENDED TO VIOLATE LAWS\nGOVERNING THE HANDLING OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION, THERE IS\nEVIDENCE THAT THEY WERE EXT EXTREMELY CARELESS IN THEIR\nHANDLING OF VERY SENSITIVE, HIGHLY CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.\nALTHOUGH THERE IS EVIDENCE OF POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS OF THE\nSTATUTES REGARDING THE HANDLING OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION, OUR\nJUDGMENT IS THAT NO REASONABLE PROSECUTOR WOULD BRING SUCH A\nCASE. >> IN SHORT, COMEY CONCLUDED\nTHAT HILLARY CLINTON AND HER TEAM WERE CARELESS BUT NOT\nCRIMINAL. NOW, FOR A WEEK, IT APPEARED TO\nBE AN OPEN QUESTION, IF THE FBI WOULD RE-EVALUATE ITS FINDINGS\nTWO FRIDAYS AGO. COMEY INFORMED CONGRESS HAS\nINVESTIGATORS STUMBLED UPON NEW, POTENTIALLY PERTINENT E-MAILS\nUNCOVERED ON A COMPUTER, ONE WE FOUND OUT WAS SHARED BY\nDISGRACED EX-CONGRESSMAN ANTHONY WEINER WITH HIS WIFE, CLINTON\nAIDE HUMA ABEDIN. PAMELA, ONCE AGAIN, A CURVE BALL\nTHROWN INTO THIS BY FBI DIRECTOR COMEY.\n>> YEAH. IT'S BEEN A BIT OF A ROLLER\nCOASTER RIDE TO SAY THE LEAST, JAKE.\nA SURPRISE LETTER FROM COMEY TO LETTERS OF CONGRESS SAYING THE\nFBI REVIEWED ALL OF THE RELEVANT E-MAILS FROM ANTHONY WEINER\nCOMPUTER IN THE SEPARATE INVESTIGATION.\nALL THE E-MAILS TO AND FROM HILLARY CLINTON AND THE FBI\nSAYING AFTER THE REVIEW, IT STANDS BY THE DECISION, THE\nRECOMMENDATION OF NO CHARGES. IT GAVE THAT BACK IN JULY.\nI CAN TELL YOU, THIS IS A SURPRISE.\nBY ALL ACCOUNTS, JAKE, FROM FOLKS WE'VE SPOKEN TO IN THE\nFBI, MY COLLEAGUE, EVAN PEREZ AND I, THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT\nWAS GOING TO TAKE A WHILE. IT WAS EXPECTED THIS REVIEW\nWOULD NOT WRAP UP UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION BECAUSE OF HOW\nLENGTHY IT CAN BE, SEPARATING THE E-MAILS AND GOING TO THE\nDIFFERENT AGENCIES TO DETERMINE IF THERE WAS CLASSIFIED\nINFORMATION. CLEARLY, FBI DIRECTOR JAMES\nCOMEY WAS AWARE OF HOW HIGH THE STAKES WERE WITH THE ELECTION\nRIGHT AROUND THE CORNER. BASED ON THIS LETTER, HE SAID,\nI'M VERY GRATEFUL TO THE PROFESSIONALS AT THE FBI FOR\nDOING AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF HIGH QUALITY WORK IN A SHORT\nAMOUNT OF TIME. THEY'VE BEEN WORKING AROUND THE\nCLOCK SINCE THE NEW E-MAILS WERE UNCOVERED.\nAS A RESULT OF THAT, THE FBI REVIEWED THE ADDITIONAL E-MAILS\nTO AND FROM HILLARY CLINTON AND DETERMINED THAT THERE STILL\nSHOULD NOT BE CHARGES. THE BAR WAS ALWAYS HIGH, JAKE.\nREMEMBER, THE FBI DID FIND CLASSIFIED INFORMATION ON\nHILLARY CLINTON'S E-MAILS IN THE INITIAL INVESTIGATION OVER THE\nCOURSE OF THAT YEAR. BUT IT DIDN'T RECOMMEND CHARGES\nBECAUSE I HAD TO PROVE INTENT, THAT THESE E-MAILS, THAT THE\nPEOPLE SENDING THEM, INCLUDING HILLARY CLINTON, KNOWINGLY AND\nWILLINGLY SENT CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.\nTHE BAR WAS VERY HIGH IN THE NEW BATCH OF E-MAILS TO UNCOVER\nINTENT. IT IS CLEAR, ACCORDING TO THE\nFBI'S LETTER, THAT DID NOT HAPPEN.\nWHAT'S UNCLEAR, JAKE, IS WHETHER NEW CLASSIFIED INFORMATION WAS\nFOUND IN THESE E-MAILS. HOW MANY BELONGED TO HILLARY\nCLINTON AND HOW MANY WERE DUPLICATES.\nTHOSE DETAILS ARE NOT INCLUDED. THE BIG NEWS IS THAT THIS PROBE\nIS OVER FOR NOW. UNLESS THEY FIND MORE E-MAILS.\nAND THAT THE FBI STANDS BY ITS DECISION BACK IN JULY, NO\nCHARGES AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON, JAKE.\n>> IN THIS RATHER BRIEF LETTER, THE FBI DIRECTOR, JAMES COMEY,\nSAID THAT SINCE HIS LETTER OF TWO FRIDAYS AGO, OCTOBER 28th,\nTHE FBI INVESTIGATIVE TEAM HAS BEEN WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK TO\nPROCESS AND REVIEW A LARGE VOLUME OF E-MAILS FROM THAT\nDEVICE. PRESUMABLY, HE MEANS THAT\nLITERALLY.

THE DIRECTOR OF THE FBI HAS\nWRITTEN A NEW LETTER TO CONGRESS THIS AFTERNOON.\nA NEW LETTER TO CONGRESS SAYING THAT, BASICALLY, REMEMBER THAT\nLETTER THAT HE SENT CONGRESS ON TWO FRIDAYS AGO?\nBASICALLY, NEVERMIND. WE'RE STICKING WITH OUR ORIGINAL\nCONCLUSION IN JULY, THAT WHAT SECRETARY CLINTON AND HER STAFF\nDID WHEN IT CAME TO THE E-MAIL SERVER WAS CARELESS BUT NOT\nCRIMINAL. LET'S BRING IN A DEMOCRAT IC\nCLINTON SUPPORTER. YOUR REACTION TO THE COMEY NEWS,\nTHIS LETTER SAYING, BASICALLY, NEVERMIND.\n>> WELL, JAKE, THIS IS A MAJOR, MAJOR DEVELOPMENT.\nTO HAVE THIS HAPPEN WITH TWO DAYS REMAKING, AS YOU YOURSELF\nHAS POINTED OUT, THAT IS NOT A LOT OF TIME FOR PEOPLE TO HEAR\nABOUT IT, TO LEARN ABOUT IT. MY INITIAL HOPE HERE IS THAT THE\nNEWSCASTERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WILL BE COVERING THIS AS MUCH AS\nTHEY COVERED THIS LETTER FOR THE LAST WEEK.\nBECAUSE I HAVE THIS NEW LETTER IN FRONT OF ME.\nIT BASICALLY SAYS THAT THEY WORKED AROUND THE CLOCK.\nTHEY REVIEWED A LARGE VOLUME OF E-MAILS AND, QUOTE, BASED ON OUR\nREVIEW, WE HAVE NOT CHANGED OUR CONCLUSIONS THAT WE EXPRESSED IN\nJULY WITH RESPECT TO SECRETARY CLINTON.\nTHIS MATTER IS RESOLVED. ADS HAVE BEEN RUN DURING THE\nLAST WEEK, CHARGES HAVE BEEN MADE AGAINST SECRETARY CLINTON\nTHAT ARE COMPLETELY UNFAIR. NOW THAT THE CLOUD IS LIFTED, IN\nTHE NEXT TWO DAYS, THE CITIZENS OF THIS COUNTRY CAN GO BACK AND\nLOOK AT WHO THEY WANT AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF BASED ON WHAT\nTHEY SAW IN THE TWOHREE DEBATES. IT IS VERY CLEAR AND IT SHOULD\nBE HILLARY CLINTON. >> DONALD TRUMP IN YOUR HOME\nSTATE OF MINNESOTA TODAY. THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN CLAIMING\nPOLLS SHOW THE RACE TIGHTENING. IT IS A STATE THAT HASN'T GONE\nREPUBLICAN FOR A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SINCE THE NIXON\nLANDSLIDE OF 1972. ARE YOU WORRIED AS YOUR\nCOLLEAGUE FROM MINNESOTA IS ABOUT THE STATE?\nCOULD IT GO TRUMP? >> FIRST OF ALL, WE ALWAYS\nWELCOME CANDIDATES TO OUR STATE. BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHTHIS, 500,0\nEARLY VOTERS. 65% THERE FOR SECRETARY CLINTON,\nDOUBLE THE EARLY VOTERS WE'VE SEEN.\nI'M TALKING ABOUT DEMOCRATIC VOTES.\nWE FEEL VERY GOOD ABOUT THE EARLY VOTES.\nWE FEEL VERY GOOD ABOUT HER STRENGTH IN THE STATE.\nWE HAVE ONE OF THE HIGHEST VOTER TURNOUTS IN THE COUNTRY.\nDOESN'T MEAN WE'RE NOT GOING TO WORK AS HARD AS WE CAN, BUT I\nBELIEVE THAT DONALD TRUMP IS DOING A TRIP, QUICK STOPS IN\nMANY, MANY STATES. THE BOTTOM LINE IS SHE IS STRONG\nIN MINNESOTA. WE'RE GOING TO WIN IT FOR\nMINNESOTA. THIS NEW NEWS FOR INDEPENDENT\nVOTERS, FOR PEOPLE THAT WERE KIND OF CONFUSED AT WHAT WAS\nGOING ON DURING THE LAST WEEK, IS SO SIGNIFICANT.\nTHE FBI DIRECTOR, WHO IS A BUSH APPOINTEE, WHO HAS BEEN\nAPPOINTED BY A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT, HAS COME OUT AND\nSAID, NOTHING CHANGES HIS CONCLUSIONS, WHICH HE ALREADY\nSAID IN JULY, IT WAS NOT A CLOSE CALL.\nTHERE WAS NO CASE AGAINST HER. SO THIS IS A BIG DEAL.\nI JUST IMPLORE YOU AND THE OTHER PEOPLE TO TALK ABOUT THIS AS\nMUCH AS YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE INITIAL LETTER OVER\nTHE LAST WEEK. I DON'T THINK THIS IS A TIME FOR\nMONDAY NIGHT QUARTERBACKING AND ANALYSIS OF IF THERE IS GOING TO\nBE HEARINGS. I THINK THIS IS A TIME TO GET\nTHE FACTS OUT. THAT IS THAT THIS CASE IS\nRESOLVED AND THE VOTERS OF THIS COUNTRY CAN MAKE A DECISION\nBASED ON THE MERITS AND WHO THEY THINK SHOULD BE COMMANDER IN\nCHIEF. SOMEONE WHO IS DOING TWEET\nSTORMS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND TALKING ABOUT ADDING\nNUCLEAR WEAPONS TO ASIA OR SOMEONE WHO HAS THE EXPERIENCE\nTO DO THIS JOB. >> SENATOR, BEFORE YOU GO, YOU\nDESCRIBED FBI DIRECTOR COMEY AS A BUSH APPOINTEE.\nHE WAS IN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.\nHE'S CURRENTLY AN OBAMA APPOINTEE.\n>> OF COURSE. THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID, MADE\nCLEAR, THAT HE DID NOT AGREE WITH THE DECISION, TO SEND THAT\nLETTER A WEEK AGO. I ALSO THOUGHT IT WAS A VERY\nSTRANGE THING TO DO AND DIDN'T AGREE WITH IT.\nBUT THE POINT IS, HE WAS ORIGINALLY A BUSH APPOINTEE.\nHE IS SOMEONE WHO GENERALLY HAS RESPECT FROM PEOPLE IN LAW\nENFORCEMENT. HE'S MADE A DECISION.\nDONALD TRUMP CANNOT GO FROM SAYING HE SUDDENLY LOVES THE FBI\nAND LOVES JIM COMEY TO SUDDENLY CRITICIZING THEM, WHICH WE HAVE\nYET TO HEAR. HE CLEARLY CONTINUED TO SAY IN\nMINNESOTA THINGS LIKE, SHE SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO RUN FOR\nOFFICE. THE PEOPLE IN MY STATE, HAVING\nBEEN AROUND THE LAST FEW WEEKS, THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW\nTHEY'RE GOING TO PAY THEIR STUDENT LOANS.\nTHEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THE MINIMUM WAGE SHOULD BE.\nTHIS IS WHAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON, THE BREAD AND\nBUTTER ISSUES. DONALD TRUMP SHOULD NO LONGER BE\nALLOWED TO DISTRACT PEOPLE WITH UNTRUE CLAIMS ABOUT CRIMINAL\nTRIALS AND WHAT'S HAPPENING X WHEN THE ONLY ONE THAT IS GOING\nTO TRIAL IS HIM WITH TRUMP UNIVERSITY AFTER THIS ELECTION\nCONCLUDES. >> SENATOR, THANKS FOR JOINING\nUS.

BUT WINNING WOULD HELP HER.\nLET'S LISTEN IN. >> THANK YOU.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH. FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU FOR THE\nAPPLAUSE. I MEAN, I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE\nEXCITED TO SEE HER. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU'D BE EXCITED\nTO SEE ME, TOO, BUT THANK YOU. BEFORE I GET STARTED, I WANT TO\nBRING UP A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE AND ALSO SOMEONE THAT'S FOR\nHILLARY, AS WELL. MY GOOD FRIEND, J.R.

LESS THAN 48 HOURS FROM ELECTION\nDAY, I'M WOLF BLITZER. WE WANT TO WELCOME OUR VIEW ERS\nIN THE UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE WORLD TO A SPECIAL EDITION\nOF \"THE SITUATION ROOM.\" WE START WITH BREAKING NEWS ON\nTHE FBI'S SURPRISING IMPACT ON THIS, THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL\nELE ELECTION, HERE IN THE UNITED\nSTATES. IT HAS NOW TAKEN A VERY DRAMATIC\nTURN. WITH THE FBI DIRECTOR JAMES\nCOMEY NOW SAYING THE FBI HAS FOUND NOTHING IN THOSE NEW\nE-MAILS THAT CHANGES THEIR ORIGINAL DECISION THAT THERE WAS\nNO CRIMINAL ACTIVITY ON THE PART OF HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHIS NEWS COMES AS THE CANDIDATES MAKE A FINAL PUSH AND\nA FINAL PLEA TO VOTERS. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.\nYOU'RE LOOKING AT LIVE PICTURES RIGHT NOW OF A HILLARY CLINTON\nRALLY IN CLEVELAND. ALSO A DONALD TRUMP EVENT THAT\nSTARTS NEXT HOUR IN STERLING HEIGHTS, MICHIGAN.\nFIRST, LET'S GO TO OUR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT, PAMELA BROWN.\nFIRST OF ALL, LET ME READ A PASSAGE FROM THE NEW LETTER FROM\nFBI DIRECTOR COMEY. QUOTE, BASED ON OUR REVIEW, WE\nHAVE NOT CHANGED OUR CONCLUSIONS THAT WE EXPRESSED IN JULY WITH\nRESPECT TO SECRETARY CLINTON. PAMELA, THIS IS SHOCKING.\nTHE REVELATION, THE TIMING, ALL OF THIS HAPPENING TWO DAYS\nBEFORE THE ELECTION. TELL US MORE ABOUT THE LETTER\nAND, SPECIFICALLY, ABOUT THE TIMING OF DIRECTOR C OR COMEY'S\nCONCLUSION. >> ANOTHER CURVE BALL FROM FBI\nDIRECTOR JAMES COMEY. ANNOUNCING TODAY THE REVIEW IS\nCOMPLETE OF THE ADDITIONAL E-MAILS.\nTHE FBI WILL NOT CHANGE ITS INITIAL DECISION OF NO CHARGES\nAGAINST HILLARY CLINTON. WE'RE TOLD FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT\nSOURCES THE REASON THIS WAS DONE SO QUICKLY, IN PART, WAS BECAUSE\nMOST OF THE NEW E-MAILS WERE DUPLICATES.\nIN OTHER WORDS, E-MAILS THE FBI HAD ALREADY REVIEWED AS PART OF\nITS INITIAL PRIVATE SERVER INVESTIGATION.\nTHERE WERE SEVERAL PERSONAL E-MAILS, AS WELL.\nTHERE WAS A LARGE VOLUME, AS DIRECTOR COMEY SAYS IN THE\nLETTER TO CONGRESS, THOUSANDS OF E-MAILS THE FBI HAD TO GO TO.\nIT IS CLEAR FROM TALKING TO OFFICIALS, THE FBI WAS AWARE OF\nHOW HIGH THE STAKES WERE. WE KNOW THAT DIRECTOR COMEY'S\nLETTER TO CONGRESS ABOUT A WEEK AND A HALF AGO REALLY SET OFF A\nPOLITICAL FIRE STORM, ESPECIALLY AMONG DEMOCRATS.\nTHE FBI WANTED TO COMPLETE THIS REVIEW AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.\nWOLF, IT IS A SURPRISE HOW QUICKLY IT WAS DONE.\nLAST WEEK, MY COLLEAGUE, EVAN PEREZ AND I WERE HEARING FROM\nFBI OFFICIALS IT WOULDN'T LIKELY WRAP UP UNTIL AFTER THE\nELECTION. OF COURSE, WOLF, WE'RE LEARNING\nNOW FROM OUR SOURCES THAT IT DIDN'T TAKE AS LONG AS\nANTICIPATED BECAUSE MOST OF THE E-MAILS HAD ALREADY BEEN\nREVIEWED AND THEY WERE PERSONAL E-MAILS.\nOF COURSE, THIS RAISES THE QUESTION ABOUT DIRECTOR COMEY'S\nINITIAL ACTION AND WHY HE SENT THAT LETTER TO CONGRESS WITHOUT\nKNOWING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE E-MAILS.\nWE KNOW THE SEARCH WARRANT WAS ISSUED AFTER THAT LETTER WAS\nSENT AND THEN, OF COURSE, NOW WE KNOW THE FBI HAS LOOKED THROUGH\nTHE E-MAILS AND DETERMINED THERE IS NOTHING NEW TO CHANGE ITS\nINITIAL RECOMMENDATION. NO MATTER WHO IS ELECTED\nPRESIDENT COME TUESDAY, IT'LL PUT DIRECTOR COMEY IN AN AWKWARD\nSPOT, NO MATTER IF IT IS HILLARY CLINTON OR DONALD TRUMP, GIVEN\nALL THAT HAS TRANSPIRED RECENTLY ESPECIALLY, WOLF.\n>> BASICALLY, OVER THE PAST NINE DAYS, SINCE THE ORIGINAL LETTER\nWAS SENT TO THE CONGRESS ON OCTOBER 28th, FBI AGENTS,\nJUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS, THEY WORKED AROUND THE CLOCK TO\nGO THROUGH THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF E-MAILS ON ANTHONY\nWEINER'S COMPUTER, TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANYTHING AT ALL", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1478473355868.1478469912213.9d78686d-e20c-4715-999b-6ab12107dab0.segment2.thumb.jpg", "channel": "202"}, {"start": 0, "length": 666679.0, "end": 666679, "date": 1478471685243, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1478474744707.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1478471682644-acc25129-62d8-4cb9-9ac3-2ef969826fd9-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=0.00,666.68", "text": "RECOMMENDED TO THE JUSTICE\nDEPARTMENT, TO CONGRESS BACK IN JULY WHEN HE SAID SHE WAS\nEXTREMELY CARELESS IN DEALING WITH CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.\nNO REASONABLE PROSECUTOR WOULD RECOMMEND CRIMINAL CHARGES.\nHE'S STICKING TO THAT ORIGINAL CONCLUSION.\n>> THAT'S RIGHT, WOLF. I CAN TELL YOU FROM TALKING TO\nLAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS, THE FBI WORKED AS QUICKLY AS IT\nCOULD, ACCORDING TO THESE PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH THE MATTER.\nTHE BAR WAS ALWAYS HIGH FOR THIS RECOMMENDATION FROM JULY TO BE\nCHANGED. IN THE NEW E-MAILS, THERE WOULD\nHAVE TO BE INFORMATION ABOUT INTENT THAT SECRETARY CLINTON AT\nTHE TIME KNOWINGLY AND WILLINGLY SENT CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.\nWE KNOW, WOLF, FROM THE PRIOR INVESTIGATION, THAT THE FBI DID\nUNCOVER SOME CLASSIFIED INFORMATION ON THE PRIVATE\nSERVER, BUT THERE WAS NO RECOMMENDATION OF CHARGES\nBECAUSE THE FBI DIRECTOR COMEY SAID THERE WAS NO DIRECT INTENT.\nIN THE NEWLY DISCOVERED E-MAILS, WE'RE LEARNING THEY WERE FROM A\nLAPTOP THAT WAS VERY OLD, WE'RE TOLD BY SOURCES.\nABOUT A DECADE OLD. MOST OF THEM, WOLF, WERE\nDUPLICATES AND PERSONAL. WE KNOW LORETTA LYNCH, THE\nATTORNEY GENERAL WHO DISAGREED WITH DIRECTOR COMEY'S INITIAL\nLETTER TO CONGRESS ABOUT THE FINDINGS WAS ON THE SAME PAGE\nWITH THE FBI ABOUT THE FINDINGS IN THIS CASE.\nAND SENDING THIS LETTER TO CONGRESS SAYING THAT THE\nRECOMMENDATION HAS NOT CHANGED. ONE OFFICIAL TOLD ME TONIGHT,\nWOLF, EVERYONE IS ON THE SAME PAGE IN THE FBI AND THE JUSTICE\nDEPARTMENT, ABOUT HOW THIS HAS WRAPPED UP.\n>> THE POLITICAL FALLOUT WILL BE SIGNIFICANT.\nPAMELA BROWN, I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING YOUR SOURCES AND WE'RE\nGETTING INFORMATION ON THE BACKGROUND, THE STORY BEHIND THE\nSTORY. I'M GOING TO GET BACK TO YOU\nSHORTLY. RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE MORE ON THE\nBREAKING NEWS. THE POLITICAL IMPACT OF ALL OF\nTHIS. I WANT TO BRING IN CNN'S CHIEF\nPOLITICAL ANALYST GLORIA BORGER AND DANA BASH.\nBALLOTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN CAST EARLY VOTING.\nTHIS LETTER, HOW FAR DOES IT GO IN REPAIRING THE DAMAGE DONE TO\nHILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN OVER THE PAST NINE DAYS?\n>> I THINK IT IS A LITTLE BIT LATE, WOLF.\nAND I THINK THAT DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT\nTHE E-MAIL ISSUE. HE'LL CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION. REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE\nPUT OUT A STATEMENT WHERE IT MENTIONED THE CLINTON FOUNDATION\nAGAIN. THIS ARGUMENT AGAINST HILLARY\nCLINTON IS NOT GOING TO STOP. I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH A\nSENIOR ADVISER TO HILLARY CLINTON WHO SAID THAT THEY'RE\nNOT GOING TO SAY ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT THIS EITHER.\nOTHER THAN WHAT THEY'VE BEEN SAYING, WHICH IS THAT THEY'RE\nGLAD THE ISSUE IS, QUOTE, RESOLVED, UNQUOTE.\nTHEY WANT TO GO INTO THE LAST 48 HOURS OF THIS CAMPAIGN WITH A\nPOSITIVE MESSAGE. THEY DON'T WANT TO BE TALKING\nABOUT HER E-MAILS OR ANYBODY ELSE'S E-MAILS.\nTHEY'RE GOING TO GO TO NEW HAMP\nHAMPSHIRE. SOME OF THE SURROGATES WILL TALK\nABOUT AND IT YOU CAN PRESUME THAT REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO\nSAY THAT THE FBI IS IN CAHOOTS WITH HILLARY CLINTON NOW.\nBUT I THINK THAT AS FOR THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN, THEY'RE GOING\nTO CONTINUE TO TRY TO MAKE A POSITIVE MESSAGE NOW FOR THE\nLAST TWO DAYS. >> WE'RE STANDING BY TO SPEAK\nWITH JASON MILLER, THE TRUMP SENIOR COMMUNICATIONS ADVISER.\nWE'LL GET THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN'S OFFICIAL REACTION TO WHAT HAS\nJUST UNFOLDED. A MAJOR, MAJOR DEVELOPMENT.\nDANA, REPUBLICANS ARE ALREADY ISSUING SOME REACTION.\nTHE RNC, THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT,\nTHIS DECISION BY THE FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY, THAT HIS\nORIGINAL CONCLUSION BACK IN JULY STILL STANDS AFTER THE NINE DAYS\nOF REVIEWING ALL THE E-MAILS ON ANTHONY WEINER'S COMPUTER.\n>> THAT'S RIGHT. GLORIA MENTIONED THE REPUBLICAN\nNATIONAL COMMITTEE'S STATEMENT. WE'RE HEARING FROM OTHER\nREPUBLICANS. DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF, ALTHOUGH\nHE DIDN'T MENTION THIS. HE KEPT THE SORT OF STORY GOING\nIN TERMS OF HITTING HILLARY CLINTON ON E-MAILS BUT ALSO ON\nTHE BROADER QUESTION OF, AS HE SAYS NOW, DRAIN THE SWAMP.\nFROM THE REPUBLICAN PERSPECTIVE, THEY ARE SAYING THAT THIS\nDOESN'T CHANGE THEIR OVERALL MESSAGE, THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS\nAN INSIDER, THAT SHE IS PART OF THE PROBLEM AND DONALD TRUMP IS\nNOT. HE IS OBVIOUSLY NOT A POLITICIAN\nOR HADN'T BEEN SINCE HE FIRST RAN FOR OFFICE A YEAR AND A HALF\nAGO. SO THE QUESTION THOUGH IS\nWHETHER OR NOT THAT IS GOING TO RESONATE GIVEN THIS NEWS.\nI THINK THE BAD NEWS FOR HILLARY CLINTON IS PROBABLY YES.\nBECAUSE AT THIS POINT, THE SPEC\nSPECIFICS MIGHT NOT MATTER AS MUCH AS THE NOISE.\nWHEN I SAY NOISE, I MEAN PEOPLE HEAR FBI, HILLARY CLINTON,\nE-MAILS. THEY'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT IT\nPRETTY INTENSELY SINCE A WEEK AGO FRIDAY.\nIT IS NEVER A GOOD THING FOR A CANDIDATE, FOR THE MESSAGE AND\nTHE SUBJECT TO BE ABOUT WHAT SHE DID OR DID NOT DO.\nBOTH SIDES WILL TELL YOU THAT. THE REALITY ALSO IS SO MANY\nPEOPLE, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, HAVE WILL\nALREADY GONE AND VOTED. YOU CAN'T PUT THE TOOTHPASTE\nBACK IN THE TUBE. WE'LL SEE HOW THIS PLAYS OUT AND\nWHETHER OR NOT THE FACT THAT JAMES COMEY DID THIS WITH JUST,\nYOU KNOW, 36 HOURS TO SPARE, IS GOING TO MAKE MUCH OF A\nDIFFERENCE IN THE MINDS OF THOSE WHO ARE RELUCTANT TO VOTE FOR\nSOMEBODY LIKE HILLARY CLINTON BECAUSE OF THE CLOUD THAT IS\nOVER HER. NEVERMIND THE SPECIFICS.\n>> I WANT BOTH OF YOU TO STAND BY.\nGLORIA AND DANA, MUCH MORE COMING IN.\nMOMENTS AFTER THE NEW FBI LETTER WENT PUBLIC, WE HEARD THIS FROM\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN. LISTEN.\nWE HAVE SEEN DIRECTOR COMEY'S LATEST LETTER TO THE HILL.\nWE WERE GLAD TO SEE THAT HE HAS FOUND, AS WE WERE CONFIDENT HE\nWOULD, THAT HE HAS CONFIRMED THE CONCLUSIONS THAT HE REALLY\nREACHED IN JULY. WE'RE GLAD THIS MATTER IS\nRESOLVED. >> STANDING BY.\nWE'LL BE SPEAKING LIVE WITH JASON MILLER, THE TRUMP SENIOR\nCOMMUNICATIONS MANAGER. JOINING ME NOW IS THE CHAIRMAN\nOF THE BLACK CAUCUS, HILLARY CLINTON SUPPORTER.\nTHANK YOU, CONGRESSMAN, FOR JOINING US.\n>> GOOD AFTERNOON. >> WHAT'S YOUR INITIAL REACTION\nTO THIS NEW COMEY LETTER, JUST RELEASED TODAY, SAYING THE FBI'S\nJULY CONCLUSION STANDS? THE CONCLUSION THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON'S USE OF A PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER WAS CARELESS,\nEXTREMELY CAREL LLESS IN THE FB DIRECTOR'S WORDS BUT NOT\nCRIMINAL. HE'S STANDING BY THAT AFTER\nREVIEWING ALL THE NEW E-MAILS DISCOVERED ON ANTHONY WEINER'S\nCOMPUTER. YOUR REACTION?\n>> WOLF, I READ DIRECTOR COMEY'S LETTER A FEW MINUTE AGO.\nIT IS FINALLY OVER. THE DISTRACTION OF THE E-MAILS\nHAS DISTRACTED FROM THE CAMPAIGN BUT WE ARE GLAD IT IS OVER.\nNOW WE CAN GET BACK TO THE CENTRAL ISSUES THAT FACED THIS\nCAMPAIGN. DIRECTOR COMEY COULD HAVE DONE\nTHIS WEEKS AGO. RATHER THAN WRITING A BETTER TO\nCONGRESS AND STIRRING UP THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE, HE COULD HAVE\nTAKEN THE EIGHT OR NINE DAYS, REVIEWED THE E-MAILS AND MADE\nTHE PRONOUNCEMENTS THEN. I WAS DISAPPOINTED HE STIRRED UP\nTHE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. THE GOOD NEWS IS THIS IS NOW\nOVER. NOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN\nCONCENTRATE ON CHOOSING THE NEXT PRESIDENT AND COMMANDER IN\nCHIEF. >> DOES YOUR CONFIDENCE IN THE\nFBI DIRECTOR, HAS IT BEEN RENEWED?\n>> DIRECTOR COMEY HAS A GOOD REPUTATION AND HAS BEEN A LAW\nENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONAL FOR MANY YEARS.\nI'M STILL EVALUATING WHY HE WOULD SEND SUCH A LETTER TO\nCONGRESS. WE'LL PUT IT ASIDE FOR RIGHT NOW\nAND CONCENTRATE ON THIS ELECTION AND TAKING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\nIN A POSITIVE DIRECTION. >> AS YOU KNOW, SINCE THE\nORIGINAL LETTER CAME OUT AT THE END OF OCTOBER, A LOT OF BALLOTS\nHAVE BEEN CAST, ABOUT 40 MILLION OR SO.\nMAYBE ANOTHER 70 OR 80 MILLION WILL STILL VOTE BETWEEN NOW AND\nELECTION DAY. DOES THIS NEW LETTER FROM COMEY,\nNINE DAYS AFTER THE ORIGINAL LETTER, DOES IT REALLY UNDO SOME\nOF THE DAMAGE THAT WAS DONE TO THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN?\n>> I'M NOT SURE THE LETTER THAT COMEY SENT TO CONGRESS DID ANY\nSIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO THE CAMPAIGN.\nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAW IT FOR WHAT IT WAS.\nRIGHT HERE IN NORTH CAROLINA, WE'VE HAD 2.8 MILLION PEOPLE TO\nALREADY CAST THEIR BALLOTS HERE IN OUR STATE.\n42% OF DEMOCRATS HAVE ALREADY VOTED COMPARED TO 32% FOR\nREPUBLICANS. THE VOTERS OF NORTH CAROLINA ARE\nENGAGED AND INVOLVED IN THIS ELECTION, AS THEY ARE ALL ACROSS\nTHE COUNTRY. WE ARE POISED TO SEE ONE OF THE\nGREATEST TURNOUTS AMERICA HAS EVER SEEN.\n>> THE REASON I SAY IT MAY HAVE DAMAGED THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS\nBECAUSE THE POLLS IN SEVERAL BATTLEGROUND STATES, AS WELL AS\nNATIONALLY, SEEM TO HAVE NARROWED OVER THESE PAST FEW\nDAYS. YOU'VE SEEN THE POLLS, AS WELL.\nI ASSUME THAT THE FBI LETTER MAY HAVE HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN'S BUT YOU'RE NOT CONFIDENT OF THAT?\n>> I'M NOT CONFIDENT OF THAT. MAY HAVE HAD A MODEST EFFECT ON\nTHE POLLING BUT I THINK ALL PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS SUCH AS\nTHIS NARROW RIGHT AT THE END. WE'VE SEEN THAT HISTORICALLY.\nTHERE HAVE BEEN A FEW EXCEPTIONS THROUGHOUT THE YEARS.\nALL PRESIDENTIAL RACES ARE VERY CLOSE AT THE END.\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS A DECIDED ADVANTAGE NOW.\nTHE LETTER ISSUE IS NO LONGER -- THE E-MAIL ISSUE IS NO LONGER A\nDISTRACTION. NOW WE CAN GET READY TO TURN OUT\nOUR BASE VOTE AND TO PROVIDE FREE PUBLIC COLLEGE EDUCATION\nFOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AND TO MOVE THIS COUNTRY FORWARD AND GET ALL\nTHE DIVISION BEHIND US. WE'RE READY FOR TUESDAY.\n>> CLINTON CAMPAIGN SAID THEY ALWAYS THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE THE\nOUTCOME. TRUMP CAMPAIGN CHIEF, KELLYANNE\nCONWAY, TWEETED THIS. WHY DID YOU, YOUR CANDIDATE AND\nCOLLEAGUES ATTACK COMEY AND HIS CREDIBILITY?\nRESPOND TO THAT. >> WE KNEW THIS WOULD BE THE\nOUTCOME. THIS MATTER WAS CLOSED BACK IN\nJULY. THE FACT THAT DIRECTOR COMEY\nSENT A LETTER TO CONGRESS AND STIRRED UP THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE\nIS A REAL CONFUSING MATTER TO ME.\nTHAT IS BEHIND US NOW. WE'RE READY TO MOVE ON.\nI TALKED TO THE CAMPAIGN IN BROOKLYN A FEW MINUTES AGO.\nWE'RE NOT GIVING A HIGH-FIVE ON THIS.\nTHIS IS NOT WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT.\nSHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN A DISTRACTION IN THE BEGINNING.\nWE ARE MOVING FORWARD. SECRETARY CLINTON IS CONTINUING\nTO TRAVEL THE COUNTRY. WE'RE READY TO FACE THE AMERICAN\nPEOPLE ON TUESDAY. I'M CONFIDENT WE WILL WIN THIS\nELECTION. HILLARY CLINTON WILL BE THE NEXT\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE EXCITED ABOUT\nTHIS CAMPAIGN. >> CONGRESSMAN BUTTERFIELD,\nTHANKS FOR JOINING US.", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1478474751762.1478471682644.acc25129-62d8-4cb9-9ac3-2ef969826fd9.segment0.thumb.jpg", "channel": "202"}, {"start": 691500.0, "length": 837665.0, "end": 1529165, "date": 1478471685243, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1478474744707.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1478471682644-acc25129-62d8-4cb9-9ac3-2ef969826fd9-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=691.50,1529.16", "text": ">>> WELCOME BACK TO A SPECIAL\n\"SITUATION ROOM.\" WE'RE FOLLOWING UNEXPECTED,\nMAJOR BREAKING NEWS.

IT ALSO GAVE NEW MOMENTUM TO\nDONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN, WHICH USED THE ISSUE TO CLIP AWAY AT\nHILLARY CLINTON'S LEAD IN THE ROLLS.\nWE'RE STANDING BY AT A TRUMP RALLY.\nWE WANT TO HEAR WHAT HE HAS TO SAY ABOUT THE MAJOR NEW\nDEVELOPMENT. WE'RE ALSO GOING TO BE SPEAKING\nMOMENTARILY WITH JASON MILLER, THE SENIOR COMMUNICATIONS\nDIRECTOR FOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. WE'LL GET THE REACTION FROM THE\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN, JASON MILLER, JOINING US MOMENTARILY.\nLET'S BRING IN OUR PANEL. REBECCA BERG AND DAVID GREGORY,\nAND MARK PRESTON. ALSO WITH CNN POLITICAL\nCOMMENTATOR, DAVID. MARK, THIS REVIEW, INITIAL\nREVIEW NINE DAY S AGO SEEMED TO HAVE AN IMPACT IN THE POLLS.\nTHEY TIGHTENED IN BATTLEGROUND STATES AS WELL AS NATIONALLY.\nTWO DAYS TO GO. 36 HOURS OR WHATEVER.\nWHAT WILL BE THE IMPACT OF THIS FINAL LETTER FROM COMEY SAYING\nCASE CLOSED? >> COUPLE THINGS.\nONE, I DON'T THINK WE'RE EXPECTED TO HEAR FROM HILLARY\nCLINTON ON IT. SHE DUOESN'T WANT TO CONTINUE T\nTALK ABOUT IT. SHE'LL LET HER SURROGATES DO IT.\nTWO THINGS, THERE WILL BE VOTES HILLARY CLINTON WILL NEVER GET\nBACK NOW THAT COULD BE FROM REPUBLICANS WHO WERE NOT\nNECESSARILY ENAMORED WITH DONALD TRUMP, THINKING OF GOING TO\nHILLARY CLINTON BUT SAW THE COMEY SITUATION AND SAID, I'LL\nCAST AN EARLY BALLOT IN A BATTLEGROUND STATE.\nINTERESTING, THREE STATES TO LOOK AT AS WE HEAD TO ELECTION\nDAY BECAUSE OF THE NEWS. NEW HAMPSHIRE, MICHIGAN AND NEW\nHAMPSHIRE. THEY DIDN'T ALLOW EARLY VOTING.\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS HOURS TO HAMMER HOME THE FACT SHE DID\nNOTHING WRONG, AT LEAST IN THE EYES OF THE FBI, WHEN IT COMES\nTO THE E-MAILS. >> IT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY\nDEVELOPMENT. I DON'T REMEMBER A TIME WHEN\nSOMETHING LIKE THIS HAS HAPPENED IN THE FINAL FEW DAYS OF A\nCAMPAIGN. THE DIRECTOR OF THE FBI DIRECTLY\nGETTING INVOLVED. >> IT IS EXTRAORDINARY.\nTHE DEVELOPMENT TODAY, I THINK, WILL CONFIRM AT LEAST FOR A LOT\nOF DEMOCRATS THAT MAYBE COMEY SHOULD NOT HAVE SENT THE FIRST\nLETTER IN THE FIRST PLACE. BECAUSE THERE WAS NOTHING THERE.\nDEMOCRATS, I THINK IN THE COMING DAYS, ARE GOING TO DRIVE HOME\nTHIS MESSAGE THAT HE SHOULD HAVE INVESTIGATED THE E-MAILS FIRST,\nTHEN UPDATED CONGRESS, AS WAS NECESSARY.\nI THINK THE DEVELOPMENT TODAY MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE\nFBI AND COMEY TO DEFEND THE DECISION THEY MADE INITIALLY.\nPOLITICALLY, FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF HILLARY CLINTON,\nTHIS IS A WEEK HER CAMPAIGN NEVER GETS BACK.\nA WEEK WHEN SHE WANTED TO BE MAKING HER CLOSING MESSAGE,\nDRIVING HOME THE POSITIVE THEMES OF HER CAMPAIGN.\nINSTEAD, DEMOCRATS AND HILLARY CLINTON WERE WRAPPED UP, TRYING\nTO DEFEND THEMSELVES AGAINST THIS.\nSO THAT'S GOING TO BE SEVEN CRITICAL DAYS IN THE FINAL\nSTRETCH OF THE CAMPAIGN. THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO\nABOUT THE LOST TIME. >> EVERYBODY STAND BY.\nJASON MILLER IS JOINING US NOW. THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN SENIOR\nCOMMUNICATIONS ADVISER. JASON, THANKS VERY MUCH FOR\nJOINING US. >> WOLF, THANK YOU FOR HAVING\nME. >> SO YOU KNOW YOU'VE HEARD THE\nLETTER. SHORT LETTER FROM JAMES COMEY.\nJUST RELEASED, SENT TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS.\nREPUBLICAN CHAIRMAN, DEMOCRATIC RANKING MEMBERS IN THE HOUSE OF\nREPRESENTATIVES AND THE SENATE. SAYING BASED ON THE FBI'S REVIEW\nOVER THE NINE DAYS, OF ALL THE E-MAILS ON ANTHONY WEINER'S\nCOMPUTER, THEY HAVEN'T CHANGED THEIR INITIAL CONCLUSIONS BACK\nIN JULY THAT, YES, HILLARY CLINTON ACTED EXTREMELY CARELESS\nIN DEALING WITH CLASSIFIED INFORMATION, BUT NO REASONABLE\nPROSECUTOR WOULD RECOMMEND CRIMINAL CHARGES.\nI'D LOVE TO GET THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN'S REACTION.\n>> WE DON'T THINK ANYTHING HAS CHANGED HERE.\nWE THOUGHT DIRECTOR COMEY AND THE FBI WERE WRONG WHEN THEY\nMADE THE INITIAL RECOMMENDATION IN JULY AND THINK THEY'RE WRONG\nNOW. UNLIKE THE DEMOCRATS, WHO THE\nHEADS SPUN SO FAST LAST WEEK THEY CAUGHT WHIP LACK, CHANGING\nTHEIR POSITIONS, LIKING COMEY TO DISLIKING HIM TO LIKING HIM\nAGAIN. LET'S LOOK AT THE FACTS.\nTHERE IS STILL AN ACTIVE INVESTIGATION INTO THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION. I THINK MOST AMERICANS HAVE\nLOOKED AT THIS CASE AND REALIZED THERE IS SOMETHING CORRUPT.\nTHERE IS SOMETHING SHADY WITH THE ENTIRE CLINTON FOUNDATION\nAND THIS OUTSIDE SERVER THAT WAS SET UP.\nGOING BACK TO DIRECTOR COMEY'S WORDS OF EXTREMELY CARELESS AND\nRECKLESS. THIS WAS NOT DONE ON THE UP AND\nUP, WOLF. I THINK MOST AMERICANS GET THERE\nIS SOME SERIOUS ETHICAL ISSUES THAT WILL CONTINUE SHOULD\nSECRETARY CLINTON, HEAVEN FORBID, BE ELECTED PRESIDENT.\nTHESE CONCERNS AND ISSUES WILL RUN FOR A LONG TIME.\nTHIS WILL BE A CLOUD THAT WILL BE HANGING OVER HER FOR QUITE A\nLONG TIME. THERE IS ONLY ONE OPTION, AND\nTHAT IS TO VOTE FOR MR. TRUMP, WHO WILL COME IN AND BRING A\nFRESH, NEW SLATE AND DRAIN THE SWAMP, AS HE TALKS ABOUT ON THE\nCAMPAIGN TRAIL. >> YOU'RE RIGHT THAT THE\nDEMOCRATS CHANGED THEIR TUNE FROM JULY WHEN THEY WERE\nRELIEVED, NO CRIMINAL CHARGES WERE RECOMMENDED, TO THE END OF\nOCTOBER, WHEN HE SAID HE'D TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THE NEWLY\nDISCOVERED E-MAILS ON ANTHONY WEINER'S COMPUTER.\nTHERE WAS A VERY PRO-COMEY COMMENT BACK IN JULY.\nANTI-COMEY COMMENT SINCE THEN. BUT MR. TRUMP ALSO FLIPPED ON\nTHIS. HE WAS VERY CRITICAL IN ALL THE\nW WEEKS AFTER THE JULY CONCLUSION.\nTHEN HE WAS WELCOMING TO COMEY, EXPRESSING GRATITUDE TO HIM AND\nTHE FBI AGENTS. WE SAW A FLIP ON BOTH SIDES.\nYOU'LL AGREE, RIGHT? >> NO, NOT AT ALL, WOLF.\nMR. TRUMP WAS VERY CLEAR. HE SAID ALL ALONG HE THOUGHT THE\nFBI GOT THIS WRONG BACK IN JULY. THERE'S NO WAY WE COULD HAVE ALL\nOF THESE DELETED E-MAILS. THAT WE COULD HAVE FIVE\nDIFFERENT PEOPLE TAKING THE FIFTH IN THIS INVESTIGATION.\nCLEARLY, WE KNOW ALL THE E-MAILS WEREN'T ABOUT YOGA AND WEDDING\nPLANNING. THEN TO FIND OUT -- I DON'T KNOW\nHOW THEY WENT THROUGH 650,000 E-MAILS IN ONE WEEK.\nTHE FACT WE HAD SENSITIVE INFORMATION ENDING UP ON THE\nLAPTOP OF ANTHONY WEINER IS UNCONS\nUNCONSCIONABLE. THE FRONT PAGE OF THE\n\"WASHINGTON POST\" SHOWED CLINTON HAD HER AIDE PRINT OFF\nCLASSIFIED INFORMATION. SHE WAS RECKLESS, CARELESS,\nDISREGARD FOR TOP NATION SECURITY INFORMATION.\nIT'S NOT TALKING ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION THAT IS CLEARLY\nSTILL GOING INTO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, WHERE THEY USED IT\nAS A PAY TO PLAY OPERATION TO HELP THEM GO FROM BEING WORTH\nNOTHING WHEN THEY LEFT THE WHITE HOUSE TO BEING WORTH HUNDREDS OF\nMILLIONS OF DOLLARS. >> IS THERE ALSO AN FBI\nINVESTIGATION UNDERWAY NOW INTO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN -- OR SOME\nOFFICIALS FROM THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP\nWITH PUTIN, WITH RUSSIA? >> NO.\nWOLF, NO. THAT'S BEEN DEBUNKED BY THE \"NEW\nYORK TIMES,\" WHICH IS BY NO MEANS A FAN OF MR. TRUMP'S.\nBUT, NO, THAT'S -- I THINK THAT IS THE BEST THAT THE DEMOCRATS\nAND SECRETARY CLINTON CAN DO TO TRY TO TAKE ATTENTION AWAY FROM\nTHE FACT THEY HAVE THIS BIG, ETHICAL CLOUD HANGING OVER THEIR\nCAMPAIGN. AS LONG AS THIS INVESTIGATION IS\nSTILL CONTINUING INTO THE CLINTONS, AND YOU CAN'T ACT LIKE\nIT IS FINISHED WOLF, BECAUSE IT IS NOT, THERE IS A SERIOUS\nISSUE. WE SAW THE CLINTON INC. MEMO,\nHOW HOW THE CLINTONS COULD MAKE $66 MILLION IN THIS WHOLE PAY TO\nPLAY OPERATION. THESE ARE SOME REAL CONCERNS, I\nTHINK, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE HEADING INTO TUESDAY.\n>> DOES THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, SPECIFICALLY DONALD TRUMP, HAVE\nCONFIDENCE IN DIRECTOR COMEY? >> WHAT WE WANT TO SEE IS THE\nFBI AND THE DOJ DO THEIR JOBS. WE WANT TO SEE JUSTICE BEING\nSERVED, TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE PROCESS.\nI THINK WHAT REALLY IS FRUSTRATING MOST AMERICANS, AND\nTHIS IS PART OF THE REASON WHY MR. TRUMP HAS BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL\nON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, IS THEY VIEW THIS AS A RIGGED SYSTEM.\nTHEY SEE TOO MUCH FUNNY BUSINESS.\nHOW DO YOU GO FROM ALL OF THIS CLOUD AND THIS PILE OF\nCORRUPTION TO SAYING THEY'RE NOT GOING TO RECOMMEND CHARGES, EVEN\nTHOUGH THEY WERE EXTREMELY CARELESS AND RECKLESS WITH\nACTIVITIES, TO SAYING 11 DAYS OUT, WE FOUND THESE 650,000\nE-MAILS FROM THE SPOUSE OF A TOP AIDE, TO GOING BACK TO THE FACT\nTHAT NOTHING IS WRONG, TRYING TO PUT TOOTHPASTE BACK IN THE TUBE?\nIT DOESN'T STACK UP. MOST AMERICANS LOOK IT THIS AND\nSHAKE THEIR HEADS AND SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?\nWE SAW THE DRAMA WITH THE CLINTONS IN THE '90s.\nWE DON'T NEED IT AGAIN. LET'S BRING IN SOMEBODY NEW WHO\nWILL TAKE US IN A BETTER DIRECTION.\n>> LET ME REPEAT THE QUESTION. DOES THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN,\nSPECIFICALLY MR. TRUMP, HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE FBI DIRECTOR\nJAMES COMEY, THAT HE IS DOING A GOOD JOB?\n>> IT'S NOT MY CLAEPLAY TO SAY DIRECTOR COMEY IS DOING A GOOD\nJOB OR NOT. IT IS CLEAR THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED\nAND THIS INVESTIGATION HASN'T BEEN HANDLED WELL FROM THE\nBEGINNING. I THINK MOST AMERICANS WOULD\nSAY, HOW DO YOU GET THROUGH 650,000 E-MAILS IN A WEEK?\nJUST BECAUSE MANY OF THEM WERE DUPLICATES FROM BEFORE, I'M NOT\nSURE IT REALLY STACKS UP THAT THERE IS NOTHING THAT WAS\nCONCERNING IN THEM. GOING BACK TO THE FACT THAT\nTHERE IS AN ACTIVE INVESTIGATION INTO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION,\nSHOULD BE TROUBLING. >> THEY SAY IN THE LETTER JAMES\nCOMEY WROTE TO THE CHAIRMAN AND RANKING MEMBERS OF ALL THESE\nCONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES, THEY SAID THE FBI INVESTIGATOR TEAM\nHAS BEEN WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK OVER THE PAST NINE DAYS TO\nPROCESS AND REVIEW A LARGE VOLUME OF E-MAILS FROM -- IN\nCONNECTION WITH AN UNRELATED CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION,\nREFERRING TO THE ANTHONY WEINER INVESTIGATION.\nTHAT HE WAS SEXTING WITH A MINOR, A 15-YEAR-OLD GIRL.\nTHEY SAID THAT FBI OFFICIALS HAD ALL SORTS OF SOFTWARE TO REVIEW\nTHE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF E-MAILS.\nTHIS IS THE BOTTOM LINE CONCLUSION.\nBASED ON OUR REVIEW, WE HAVE NOT CHANGEOUR CONCLUSIONS THAT WE\nEXPRESSED IN JULY WITH RESPECT TO SECRETARY CLINTON.\nSO WHERE DOES THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN GO FROM HERE, JASON?\nARE WE GOING TO HEAR DIRECTLY FROM DONALD TRUMP SPEAK ABOUT\nTHIS? HE SPOKE AN HOUR OR SO AGO.\nDIDN'T REFER TO IT. IN HIS NEXT APPEARANCE, WILL WE\nHEAR HIM SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THIS.\n>> I WOULD EXPECT MR. TRUMP TO BRING THIS UP ON THE CAMPAIGN\nTRAIL. I WOULD EXPECT MR. TRUMP TO\nBRING UP THE FACT THERE IS AN ACTIVE, ONGOING INVESTIGATION\nINTO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION. AND THE FACT WE HAVE THIS RIGGED\nSYSTEM. THIS HAS STUNK FROM THE\nBEGINNING. THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN CHARGES\nBROUGHT AGAINST SECRETARY CLINTON.\nONE THING I'D ASK IS IF THIS WERE TO HAPPEN TO ANYBODY ELSE,\nIF THERE WERE A SPOUSE OF A STATE DEPARTMENT STAFFER OR\nEMPLOYEE WHO SHARED THIS CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OR\nSENSITIVE INFORMATION WITH OTHER PEOPLE, THEY'D BE RUN OUT OF\nTOWN IN A MINUTE. WE DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW\nSECRETARY CLINTON CAN GET AWAY WITH THIS.\nI WOULD SAY MOST PEOPLE WOULD PROBABLY AGREE AND THINK THE\nSAME THING. >> THE FBI DIRECTOR AND HIS TEAM\nOF FBI AGENTS CONCLUDED, YES, SHE WAS EXTREMELY CARELESS IN\nDEALING WITH SENSITIVE, CLASSIFIED INFORMATION, BUT HE\nSAYS THAT NO REASONABLE PROSECUTOR WOULD GO AHEAD AND\nRECOMMEND CRIMINAL CHARGES. HE IS STICKING BY THAT IN THIS\nLETTER HE JUST SENT TO THE U.S. CONGRESS.\nJASON MILLER -- >> THEY HAVEN'T CLEARED THE\nOTHER INVESTIGATION. THERE IS STILL AN ONGOING\nINVESTIGATION INTO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nAGAIN, THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO GET WRAPPED UP ANY\nTIME SOON. I REALLY THINK THE PEOPLE DO\nNEED TO KEEP THAT IN MIND AS THEY HEAD INTO THE VOTING BOOTH\nON TUESDAY. THIS CLOUD WILL HANG OVER THE\nCLINTONS FOR A LONG TIME. >> I JUST SUSPECT WE JUST HEARD\nSOME THOUGHTS THAT DONALD TRUMP WILL PUBLICLY RELAY WHEN HE GOES\nPUBLIC IN HIS NEXT ADDRESS. JASON, THANKS VERY MUCH.\n>> THANK YOU, WOLF. >> LET'S BRING BACK OUR PANEL\nAND GET SOME REACTION. DAVID GREGORY, WHAT DO YOU THINK\nABOUT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN'S REACTION TO THIS COMEY LETTER?\n>> I WONDER HOW THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN FEELS ABOUT CHRIS\nCHRISTIE, WHO IS RUNNING THEIR TRANSITION, WHOSE AIDES WERE\nCONVICTED IN THE BRIDGEGATE SCANDAL, AND WHETHER HE STILL\nHAS CREDIBILITY IN THE ROLE. MIKE PENCE SAID THEY STAND BY\nHIM. WHY?\nBECAUSE CHRISTIE HAS NOT BEEN CHARGED WITH ANY CRIME, WHICH IS\nSIMILAR TO WHAT THE FBI DIRECTOR CONCLUDED ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON.\nJASON MILLER IS MAKING A POLITICAL ARGUMENT.\nHE IS MAKING AN ETHICAL ARGUMENT AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON.\nMANY CAN AND SHOULD MAKE A DETERMINATION ON HILLARY CLINTON\nBASED ON WHAT WE KNOW THUS FAR. HERE ARE THE FACTS.\nCOMEY, AS HEAD OF THE FBI, IS NOT A PERSON.\nIT IS AN INSTITUTION. BUT COMEY MADE THIS ABOUT HIM.\nGOING BACK TO JULY, HE HAD A REVOLT WITHIN THE FBI.\nAGENTS WHO HATE THE CLINTONS, FELT THEY SHOULD BE CHARGED WITH\nA CRIME, AND HE FELT THE NEED TO PUBLICLY JUSTIFY WHY HE DIDN'T\nFEEL THERE SHOULD BE CHARGES TO QUELL THE RESULT INSIDE.\nEVERYBODY CRITICIZED HIM. HE PUT HIS THUMB ON THE SCALE\nNINE DAYS AGO. COULD HAVE INVESTIGATED THIS AND\nFIGURED IT OUT WITHOUT IMPACTING THE ELECTION YET CHOSE NOT TO.\nTHAT IS THE PART THAT IS UNPRECEDENTED.\nIF YOU ARE A REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT, YOU HAVE TO LOOK PAST\nTHIS YEAR'S POLITICS. YOU DON'T WANT AN FBI DIRECTOR\nIMPACTING AN ELECTION. THE RULE OF LAW IS MORE\nIMPORTANT THAN THIS PARTICULAR ELE\nELECTION. IT SEEMS TO ME, WHAT JASON\nMILLER IS SAYING, THEY'RE NOT TOO CONCERNED ABOUT THAT.\nTHAT'S A REAL PROBLEM. THE FBI DIRECTOR ALLOWED HIMSELF\nTO BE INSERTED INTO THIS. I COVERED THE BUSH WHITE HOUSE.\nI REMEMBER WHEN A SENIOR ADVISER WAS VERY CLOSE TO BEING\nINDICTED. HE WAS NOT CHARGED WITH ANY\nCRIME BUT THEY WERE VERY ANXIOUS AND CRITICAL OF THE MEDIA AND\nTHE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR FOR SO MUCH SCRUTINY ABOUT THE\nINVESTIGATION WHEN IT DIDN'T", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1478474922732.1478471682644.acc25129-62d8-4cb9-9ac3-2ef969826fd9.segment3.thumb.jpg", "channel": "202"}, {"start": 0, "length": 218348.0, "end": 218348, "date": 1478473484971, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1478476051035.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1478473482474-b5401786-1a48-4ed0-a985-483fdfbe36ae-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=0.00,218.35", "text": "AS FAR AS THE FBI DIRECTOR IS\nCONCERNED, THE CLINTON E-MAIL PRIVATE SERVER INVESTIGATION,\nCASE CLOSED. >> YEAH, CASE CLOSED.\nI THINK DAVID MAKES A GOOD POINT ABOUT GOING BACK TO JULY WHEN\nTHE -- WHEN DIRECTOR COMEY INITIALLY SAID CASE CLOSED.\nMAKING THE UNPRECEDENTED SPEECH, EXPLAINING WHY, FOR THE REASONS\nYOU SAID.

EXCUSE ME, I SKIPPED OVER IT.\nA PERSONAL FAMILY FOUNDATION THAT -- THANK YOU -- TOOK\nMILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS.\nIN BETWEEN THOSE TWO THINGS, SHE HAD THAT PRIVATE SERVER.\nAPPARENTLY, SHE HAD A PRIVATE SERVER TO KIND OF KEEP OUT OF\nOUR REACH WHATEVER WAS GOING ON WHEN SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE\nAND HAD A PRIVATE FOUNDATION. AND WHEN IT WAS DISCOVERED BY\nTHE MEDIA THAT SHE HAD THE PRIVATE SERVER, SHE USED HIGH\nTECHNOLOGY AND HAMMERS TO TRY AND GET RID OF ALL OF IT.\nI MEAN, YOU KNOW, THE FBI LAST SUMMER CONCLUDED THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON HAVING CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS ON THE PRIVATE SERVER\nWAS EXTREMELY CARELESS. I GUESS TODAY, I DON'T KNOW IF\nYOU HEARD, TODAY THEY ANNOUNCED THEY HAD NOT CHANGED THAT\nCONC CONCLUSION.\nWELL, I'LL LET YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW, MISHANDLING CLASSIFIED\nINFORMATION IS A CRIME. AND HILLARY CLINTON, LET'S\nREMEMBER WHAT WE KNOW. HILLARY CLINTON SAID THAT SHE\nNEVER SENT OR RECEIVED ANY CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.\nTHE DIRECTOR OF THE FBI TOLD THE CONGRESS, CLASSIFIED INFORMATION\nWAS SENT. HILLARY CLINTON SAID THERE WAS\nNOTHING MARKED CLASSIFIED ON HER E-MAILS, SENT OR RECEIVED.\nTHE FBI DIRECTOR TOLD THE CONGRESS THAT'S NOT TRUE.\n>> MIKE PENCE SPEAKING IN HICKORY, NORTH CAROLINA, MOMENTS\nAGO, REACTING TO THE FBI DIRECTOR'S LETTER TO CONGRESS.\nSAYING CASE CLOSE AS FAR AS THE HILLARY E-MAIL SERVER IS\nCONCERNED.

WHAT MIKE PENCE JUST SAID IS\nDANGEROUS. IT IS JUST LIKE TRUMP SAYING I\nWILL NOT ACCEPT THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION.\nTHE FBI DIRECTOR HAS RECOMMENDED NO CHARGES.\nWE LIVE IN A SOCIETY THAT'S GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW AND\nBY AN INDEPENDENT FBI DIRECTOR WHO HAS A TEN-YEAR TERM.\nAND AN ATTORNEY GENERAL. FOR HIM TO SAY THAT THIS IS ALL\nRIGGED AND YOU CAN'T BELIEVE THAT, AND HE IS GOING TO\nPRONOUNCE, AS A GUY WHO IS A FORMER CONGRESSMAN AND A\nGOVERNOR, HE KNOWS WHAT IS LEGAL AND NOT LEGAL.\nTHAT IS NOT JUST IRRESPONSIBLE, IT IS DANGEROUS FOR OUR COUNTRY.\nWE'VE GOT TO GET BEYOND REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT HERE.\nTHEY WILL RUE THE DAY THEY ARE IN A SIMILAR SITUATION AND YOU\nHAVE SOMEBODY PLAYING WITH THE ROLE OF THE FBI DIRECTOR OR THE\nATTORNEY GENERAL.

HILLARY CLINTON'S CASE FOR WHY\nSHE SHOULD BE PRESIDENT. NOT DEFENDING HER AND DEFENDING\nTHE STATE DEPARTMENT OVER THIS ISSUE.\nIT WAS REALLY A DETOUR THAT NONE OF THEM WANTED.\nSO THEY ARE TRYING TO FORGE AHEAD DURING THESE LAST TWO DAYS\nOF THE ELECTION. TRYING TO REFOCUS THE CAMPAIGN\nON WHAT THEY WANTED TO BE FOCUSED ON FOR THE PAST WEEK IN\nTHE FIRST PLACE. FRANKLY, IT'S BETTER FOR THEM.\nWE'VE SEEN THIS REFLECTED IN THE P\nPOLLING.

WHAT A CRAZY ELECTION.\n>> YEAH. >> I THINK BACK TO DAVID'S POINT\nRIGHT NOW. I THINK IT IS INCREDIBLY\nDANGEROUS TO BE POLITICIZING THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION.\nBOTH POLITICAL PARTIES. NOT JUST REPUBLICANS BUT WE SAW\nHILLARY CLINTON SUPPORTERS COMING OUT AND SAYING COMEY WAS\nDOING IT FOR POLITICAL REASONS. EVERYTHING WE KNOW ABOUT COMEY\nIS HE IS NOT NECESSARILY POLITICAL.\nWE MAY BE A REPUBLICAN BUT HIS TENURE AT THE FBI HASN'T BEEN\nONE OF POLI-- HE MADE AN ERROR. BUT IT IS DANGEROUS.\n>> HE IS A FORMER DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL, NOW THE FBI\nDIRECTOR. UNTIL NOW, HE'S HAD A PRETTY\nGOOD REPUTATION. >> RIGHT.\nYOU'VE SEEN THE POLITICIZATION. DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN A LITTLE\nMORE CRITICAL. TODAY, REPUBLICANS ARE COMING\nBACK AND BEING CRITICAL. I AGREE WITH DAVID THOUGH, THAT\nWHAT GOVERNOR PENCE SAID IS DANGEROUS FOR THE REASONS YOU\nSTATED. IT IS NOT JUST SAYING THAT, AS A\nMATTER OF POLITICS, WE WANT TO FOCUS ON, AS JASON MILLER DID,\nTHE ONGOING INVESTIGATION ABOUT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nIT IS SAYING THEY DON'T ACCEPT THE RESULTS OF AN INVESTIGATION\nBY THE FBI. >> QUICKLY, INTERESTING\nCHALLENGE. IF HILLARY CLINTON BECOMES\nPRESIDENT, THERE WILL BE A TEMPTATION AMONG THOSE AROUND\nHER TO GO AFTER COMEY, MAYBE SEEK TO FIRE HIM, A POLITICAL\nDISASTER. IF SHE IS PRESIDENT, DOES HE\nCALL HIM IN AND PUBLICLY SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, I DISAGREE WITH\nHOW YOU HANDLED THE INVESTIGATION, OBAMA DISAGREED,\nBUT YOU ARE MY GUY, AMERICA'S FBI DIRECTOR AND I'LL EMBRACE\nYOU.

WHAT THIS MEANS IS FOR THE FBI'S\nPURPOSES HERE, THIS IS A CLOSED INVESTIGATION.\nTHIS IS DONE. AT LEAST FOR NOW.\nKEEP IN MIND, THERE WERE 30,000 E-MAILS THAT WERE DELETED FROM\nTHE PRIVATE SERVER. THE FBI WAS ABLE TO RECOVER\nABOUT 15,000 OF THOSE E-MAILS. ABOUT 15,000 ARE SOMEWHERE ELSE.\nWE DON'T KNOW, MAYBE DELETED FOREVER.\nIF THEY TURN UP SOMEWHERE ELSE, THE FBI WILL BE RIGHT BACK HERE\nAGAIN DOING THIS REVIEW, CHECKING TO SEE IF THERE IS\nANYTHING BRAND-NEW AND ANYTHING THAT CHANGES THEIR CONCLUSION.\nTHAT COULD HAPPEN AT ANY TIME. OBVIOUSLY, THAT'S ONE OF THE\nPROBLEMS WITH THIS CASE. WE SHOULD ALSO ADD THAT PER HUMA\nABEDIN, WHOSE E-MAILS THESE WERE, THE FBI PROBABLY STILL\nWILL NEED TO TALK TO HER.

WHAT HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO\nFIGHT IS FOR WOMEN AND HER PHILANDERER IN THE US WHO.\n>> SHE WAS SAYING WE DIDN'T NEED TO BE RUDE TO EACH OTHER IN THE\nONLINE SPACE. >> I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS BOTH\nPOINTS. >> YOU'RE GOING OFF ON AN\nANONYMOUS SOURCE. THIS IS NOT A TRUE FACT.\nWHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH IS HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP\nSEE THE GOAL LINE LIKE THEY ARE A THOROUGHBRED WITH BLINDERS ON.\nTHEY ARE NOT LETTING ALL THE OTHER DRAMA ON THE CAMPAIGN\nTRAIL AND MR. TRUMP SEES IT RUNNING STEADY BUT HE STILL HAS\nACCESS TO THE TWITTER. >> ALL RIGHT.\nBREAKING NEWS, THE FBI CLEARS HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHIS IS \"CNN TONIGHT.\" I'M DON LEMON.\nJAMES COMEY SENDING A LETTER TO CONGRESS SAYING INVESTIGATORS\nFOUND NOTHING IN THE RECENTLY DISCOVERED E-MAILS TO LEAD THEM\nTO RECOMMEND CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON.\nMOST OF THE E-MAILS WERE PERSONAL AND DUPLICATES OF WHAT\nWAS ALREADY SEEN. THAT'S ACCORDING TO LAW\nENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS. SO WHERE DOES THIS LATEST\nBOMBSHELL LEAVE US? WITH JUST TWO DAYS TO GO UNTIL\nELECTION DAY AND WHAT DOES THIS SAY ABOUT THE FBI.\nLET'S GET TO EVAN PEREZ AND MARK PRESTON.\nPHILIP BUMP AND DAVID SWIRDLEK WITH US AS WELL.\nA NEW LETTER FROM COMEY. ANOTHER GRENADE ON THE CAMPAIGN\nTRAIL TODAY. >> ANOTHER SURPRISE.\nA THREE PARAGRAPH LETTER TO EBB MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IN WHICH HE\nSAYS ESSENTIALLY, NEVER MIND. THE LETTER HE SENT TEN DAYS AGO\nSTARTED A NEW PART OF THE INVESTIGATION.\nWHAT IT MEANT IS THAT FBI AGENTS HAVE BEEN WORKING AROUND THE\nCLOCK FOR TEN DAYS. THEY HAVE BEEN REVIEWING THE\nE-MAILS, THOUSANDS OF E-MAILS. AND AT THE END OF IT ALL THEY\nDETERMINED THAT MOST OF IT WAS STUFF THEY HAD SEEN BEFORE.\nA LOT OF DUPLICATES AND PERSONAL E-MAILS.\nTHE LETTER IN PART READS LIKE THIS FROM COMEY.\nIT SAYS SINCE MY LETTER THE FBI INVESTIGATIVE TEAM HAS BEEN\nWORKING AROUND THE CLOCK TO PROCESS AND REVIEW A LARGE\nVOLUME OF E-MAILS FROM A DEVICE OBTAINED IN RELATION TO AN\nINVESTIGATION. DURING THE PROCESS WE REVIEWED\nTHE COMMUNICATIONS TO AND FROM HILLARY CLINTON WHILE SHE WAS\nSECRETARY OF STATE. BASED ON OUR REVIEW WE HAVE NOT\nCHANGED OUR CONCLUSIONS THAT WE EXPRESSED IN JULY WITH RESPECT\nTO SECRETARY CLINTON. WHAT THIS MEANS, DON, IS AS FAR\nAS THE FBI IS CONCERNED AND AS FAR AS HILLARY CLINTON IS\nCONCERNED, THIS INVESTIGATION IS NOW OVER.\nTHERE ARE STILL A FEW THINGS THEY WANT TO DO.\nSTILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE E-MAILS MANAGED TO GET ON A\nLAPTOP THAT BELONGED TO ANTHONY WEINER.\nTHEY WILL PROBABLY NEED TO INTERVIEW HUMA ABEDIN ONCE MORE\nTO FIGURE OUT IF SHE CAN EXPLAIN THAT.\nSHE TOLD HER LAWYERS, THEY SAID ON HER BEHALF SHE HAS NO IDEA\nHOW THE E-MAILS GOT ON THIS COMPUTER BECAUSE SHE SAID SHE\nDIDN'T USE IT. THAT'S PART OF THE MYSTERY THAT\nREMAINS HERE. FOR HILLARY CLINTON THIS MEANS\nSHE CAN CLOSE THIS CHAPTER AT LEAST FOR NOW.\n>> LESS THAN 48 HOURS BEFORE ELECTION DAY.\nWHERE DOES THIS LEAVE CLINTON AND TRUMP?\n>> A COUPLE OF THINGS. IT'S TAKEN A LITTLE BIT OF AIR\nOUT OF THE TRUMP MOMENTUM HE RECEIVED FROM THE COMEY LETTER\nBUT IS IT TOO LATE? PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY VOTED.\nABOUT 37 MILLION PEOPLE IN 39 STATES CAST EARLY BALLOTS.\nJUST GO BACK TO WHEN THE LETTER WAS RELEASED.\nDONALD TRUMP WAS SAYING LOOK IN SOME STATES YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR\nVOTE. CHANGE YOUR VOTE.\nMOST OF THOSE STATES WE ARE SEEING YOU CAN NO LONGER CHANGE\nYOUR VOTE. FOR HILLARY CLINTON SHE NEEDS TO\nSTAY ON MESSAGE AND TALK ABOUT HER MESSAGE FOR THE FUTURE AND\nHOPE HER SURROGATES IN THE NEWS MEDIA AND WORD OF MOUTH CAN HELP\nCARRY THE MESSAGE THAT SHE'S BEEN EXONERATED AGAIN BY THE\nFBI. I DON'T THINK SHE'LL WANT TO\nKEEP SPEAKING ABOUT IT. WE HAVEN'T SEEN HER DISCUSS IT\nPERSONALLY. WE DON'T EXPECT HER TO DO SO.\nBUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THERE WAS A LOT OF DAMAGE DONE\nBECAUSE OF THE LETTER. IT HAS BEEN RECTIFIED IN SOME\nWAYS. IT COULD BE TOO LATE.\nTHREE STATES TO LOOK AT. MICHIGAN, NEW HAMPSHIRE,\nPENNSYLVANIA. NO EARLY VOTE IN THOSE STATES\nNOW. HILLARY CLINTON IS DOING A BIG\nRALLY IN PENNSYLVANIA. THEY WILL BE IN MICHIGAN\nTOMORROW.

ABOUT A MONTH AGO THE FBI TOOK\nPOSSESSION OF A LAPTOP BELONGING TO ANTHONY WEINER, HUSBAND OF\nHUMA ABEDIN, ONE OF CLINTON'S CLOSEST AIDES.\nTHE TEAM SPENT A YEAR LOOKING AT THE CLINTON E-MAIL SERVER WAS\nBROUGHT BACK TO REVIEW TENS OF THOUSANDS OF E-MAILS.\nINVESTIGATORS FOUND SOME CLASSIFIED INFORMATION IN THOSE\nE-MAILS. BUT HOW MUCH OF IT AND WHAT\nLEVEL OF CLASSIFICATION WE DON'T KNOW.\nWHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THESE E-MAILS WERE LARGELY DUPLICATES\nOR SOME WERE CERTAINLY. INVESTIGATORS STILL WANT TO TALK\nTO HUMA ABEDIN, AND SHE HAS SAID THAT SHE DOESN'T KNOW HOW THESE\nE-MAILS GOT THERE. POPPY?\n>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT REPORTING.\nDONALD TRUMP STUMPING LATE INTO THE NIGHT.\nHE RALLIED SUPPORTERS IN THE BATTLEGROUND STATE OF\nPENNSYLVANIA SUNDAY EVENING BEFORE HEADING TO VIRGINIA.\nJUST MOMENTS AGO, TRUMP WRAPPED UP AN EARLY MORNING SPEECH TO A\nBIG CROWD IN LEESBURG. THAT'S WHERE WE FIND OUR CNN\nSENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT JIM ACOSTA.\nJIM, IT DOESN'T MATTER THEY HAVE WORK TOMORROW MORNING.\nTHEY STAYED UP LATE FOR TRUMP. >> ABSOLUTELY.\nAND SOME OF THE PEOPLE HERE IN THIS BARN HERE IN LEESBURG,\nVIRGINIA WAITED FIVE OR SIX HOURS.\nIT'S A PRETTY CHILLY TEMPERATURES FOR DONALD TRUMP TO\nSHOW UP. BUT THEY GOT WHAT THEY WERE\nWAITING FOR. DONALD TRUMP CAME OUT HERE AFTER\nMIDNIGHT AND REALLY LIT INTO HILLARY CLINTON ONCE AGAIN\nREFERRING TO HER AS CORRUPT, AS DISHONEST, AS SOMEBODY WHO A\nPUBLIC CAN'T TRUST. IT IS REALLY HIS CLOSING\nARGUMENT IN THIS CAMPAIGN. IT'S INTERESTING TO NOTE, POPPY,\nEVER SINCE THAT JIM COMEY LETTER CAME OUT EARLIER TODAY, DONALD\nTRUMP HAS BEEN SORT OF TREADING, LIGHTLY TREADING CAREFULLY\nAROUND THIS SUBJECT. HE HASN'T REALLY GONE AFTER THE\nFBI DIRECTOR AND HIT HIM RIGHT IN THE NOSE.\nHE HAS REALLY JUST BEEN SORT OF COMPLAINING THAT THERE IS NO WAY\nTHE FBI COULD HAVE CONDUCTED A REAL THOROUGH INVESTIGATION IN\nITS LAST WEEK AND A HALF SINCE JIM COMEY ANNOUNCED EIGHT OR\nNINE DAYS AGO THAT THEY WERE SORT OF RELAUNCHING THIS LOOK\nINTO HER PRIVATE E-MAIL SEVENER. LISTEN TO HOW HE DESCRIBED IT\nJUST A LITTLE WHILE AGO HERE IN VIRGINIA.\n>> HILLARY CLINTON IS THE MOST CORRUPT PERSON EVER TO SEEK THE\nOFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES.\nSHE'S BEING PROTECTED BY A TOTALLY RIGGED SYSTEM.\nI'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE RIGGED SYSTEM, FOLKS.\nI UNDERSTAND THE RIGGED SYSTEM. I UNDERSTAND.\nTHIS IS A RIGGED SYSTEM. THIS IS A RIGGED SYSTEM.\n>> NOW, PART OF THE PROBLEM FOR DONALD TRUMP IN ALL OF THIS,\nPOPPY, AS YOU KNOW EARLIER THIS SUMMER, AFTER JIM COMEY FIRST\nSAID THEY WERE NOT GOING TO BRING CHARGES AGAINST HILLARY\nCLINTON, DONALD TRUMP WAS SAYING THAT THE FBI WAS PART OF THIS\nRIGGED SYSTEM. TO GIVE THE ELECTION TO HILLARY\nCLINTON. THEN EIGHT OR NINE DAYS AGO WHEN\nTHAT LETTER CAME OUT SAYING WELL, THEY'RE TAKING A WHOLE NEW\nLOOK AT THIS, IT WAS JUST LAST MONDAY WHEN DONALD TRUMP WAS\nSAYING JAMES COMEY HAS RESURRECTED HIS REPUTATION.\nIT TOOK A LOT OF GUTS DO WHAT HE DID.\nAT THIS LAST RALLY OF THE DAY,", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1478502926075.1478498825189.c7198368-f399-4a58-9c32-7cc714933abd.segment5.thumb.jpg", "channel": "202"}, {"start": 0, "length": 933938.0, "end": 933938, "date": 1478504246051, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1478508266140.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1478503938614-e77e9d71-fcbb-465b-9529-e7f7d8142d4d-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=0.00,933.94", "text": "RACE OF YOUR LIFETIME.\nHOURS BEFORE ELECTION SAY DIRECTOR COMEY WRAPS UP THE\nREVIEW OF THE E-MAILS.

AND LAURA, LET ME BEGIN WITH\nYOU. THE FBI ONCE AGAIN SAYS CASE\nCLOSED WITH CLINTON. UNLESS ANY NEW DEVICES ARE FOUND\nOR MORE E-MAILS. YOU SAY THIS IS NOT THE END.\nTHE COMEY LETTER IS NOT THE END OF THE ISSUE FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON. >> IT'S NOT.\nTHE REASON YOU JUST STATED. COMEY SET AN ODD PRECEDENT.\nHE'S SAID I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO UPDATE CONGRESS.\nIF THERE IS ANYTHING THAT MAY BE RELATED TO WHAT I TESTIFIED\nABOUT ON THE HILL, AND SO THERE IS A CONCEIVABLE NUMBER OF\nDEVICES THAT MAY STILL BE FOUND WITH HER AIDES IN VARIOUS\nDEGREES. IT MAY BE A CASE, THIS IS A\nREDUNDANT ISSUE THAT MAY CONTINUE TO COME UP AGAIN AND\nAGAIN. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN\nCAPITALIZED BY DONALD TRUMP, AND WITH GOOD REASON.\nIT PRESENTS THE AMERICAN PUBLIC THAT THERE'S A SHADOW OF PERHAPS\nMUCH MORE TO TIME IF SHE IS PRESIDENT.\nAND SO THIS IS ONE OF THE FAILURES OF I THINK COMEY IN\nTHIS CASE IS THAT WHEN HE DID THIS, HE -- IT'S AN IRREVERSIBLE\nERROR. NOW IT WILL CONTINUE TO HAUNT\nTHIS CAMPAIGN THROUGH THE INAUGURATION IF SHE'S ELECTED.\n>> AND PERHAPS BEYOND, RIGHT? >> YES.\n>> AGAIN, IF NEW DEVICE ARE FOUND.\nWE KNOW THE CLINTON BELIEVE THIS HURT THEM.\nTO WHAT EXTENT, WE WON'T KNOW UNTIL TUESDAY.\nTHE INTERNAL POLLING SHOWED IT URT THEM.\nTHE LETTER COMEY SENT NINE DAYS AGO.\nWHY IS SHE MAKING THE CHOICE NOT TO ADDRESS THIS HEAD ON ON THE\nSTUMP? THIS IS GOOD NEWS FOR HER.\nSHE DIDN'T TALK IT TONIGHT. SHOO\nSHE'S NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT MUCH TOMORROW.\n>> THIS IS RELIEF THIS IS GOOD NEWS FOR THEM.\nBUT IN ESSENCE, THEY DON'T WANT TO DRAW MORE ATTENTION TO IT BY\nHAVING CLINTON COME OUT AND TALK ABOUT IT AND COME OUT AT\nRALLIES. CERTAINLY THAT WAS A DISCUSSION\nWITHIN THE CAMPAIGN OVER THE LAST MANY HOURS.\nSHE'S NOT ADDRESSING IT. THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE HER\nCLOSING MESSAGE IS POSITIVE, A MESSAGE SHE'S CONTROLS, NOT\nABOUT THE FBI. SO MUCH OVER THE LAST TEN DAYS\nFOR HER HAVE BEEN DICTATED BY THIS COMEY LETTER THAT'S SUCKED\nUP SO MUCH OF THE OXYGEN AND THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN BELIEVES THIS\nCOST THEM VOTES AND THINK NOW IT'S A WOUND THAT CAN'T BE\nHEALED IN THE LAST FEW DAYS OF THE CAMPAIGN.\nAND THAT'S WHY WE'RE NOT SEEING SECRETARY CLINTON PUT A\nSPOTLIGHT ON IT ONCE AGAIN. >> BRYAN, WE'LL NEVER FORGET\nMICHELLE OBAMA SAYING WHEN THEY GO LOW, WE GO HIGH.\nTHAT'S SOMETHING THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS EMBRACED, BUT IT'S\nNOT WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE FINAL DAYS, IS IT?\n>> IT'S NOT. BOTH THESE CANDIDATES ARE TRYING\nTO HAVE IT BOTH WAY BY HAVING POSITIVE MESSAGES, SHARING\nPOSITIVE THEMES BUT MOSTLY ENGAGING IN NEGATIVE CAMPAIGNING\nAND NEGATIVE TV ADS. I THINK EVEN THOUGH THE E-MAIL\nDEVELOPMENT, THE BIG UNANSWERED QUESTION AND THE BIG STORY IS\nGOING TO BE WHAT WAS GOING ON INSIDE THE FBI AND WHAT IS STILL\nGOING ON INSIDE THE FBI. HOW MUCH OF A REBELLION IS THERE\nRIGHT NOW AND WILL THERE CONTINUE TO BE AFTER ELECTION\nDAY? I THINK OF THIS BEING A MILD\nPOST, BUT THERE'S MORE WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT WHAT'S REALLY GOING\nON. >> JULIAN, YOU SAY THERE'S\nEXACTLY TO BRYAN'S POINT, THERE'S JUST PERHAPS NOT MUCH OF\nAN APPETITE WITHIN CONGRESS TO TAKE ON THE FBI SINCE THE DAYS\nOF JAY EDGAR HOOVER. >> RIGHT, POLITICIANS ARE ALWAYS\nRELUCTANT TO TAKE ON THE FBI BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT THE FBI\nTO GO BACK AGAINST THEM. AT THE SAME TIME IT'S NOT CLEAR\nREPUBLICANS WOULD GO AFTER THE FBI IF THEY CONTROL CONGRESS.\nTHE QUESTION IS WOULD A DEMOCRATIC SENATE DO SOMETHING IN?\nI THINK SENATOR FRANKEN RAISED THE QUESTION ABOUT LOOKING INTO\nTHE AGENCY. >> WE TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHERE\nTHE LEAKS ARE COMING FROM. >> WITH RUDY GIULIANI SAYING IN\nTHE MORNING AN FRIDAY, YOU KNOW, I'VE HEARD THIS AND HEARD THIS.\nAND THEN SAYING LATER TO WOLF, NO, IT WAS FORMER FBI AGENTS.\n>> THAT'S THE BOOK I'D LIKE TO READ IS WHAT HAPPENED INSIDE THE\nFBI, WHAT AGENTS WERE TAKING WHAT POSITION.\nIT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF MYSTERY THERE STILL.\n>> LONNIE, REGARDLESS OF WHO WINS WHETHER IT IS TRUMP OR\nCLINTON, I THINK IT'S HARD TO DISPUTE THE ARGUMENT THAT\nTHERE'S BEEN A FRACTURING OF YOUR PARTY, OF THE REPUBLICAN\nPARTY, AND THE QUESTION IS TO WHAT EXTENT IS IT LASTING?\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE YOUR PARTY DO COME WEDNESDAY MORNING?\n>> I THINK PART OF IT DEPENDS OBVIOUSLY ON WHETHER TRUMP WINS\nOR LOSES. I THINK IF TRUMP WINS, IT'S\nGOING TO BE DIFFICULT FOR THOSE WHO OPPOSED HIM TO CONTINUE AS\nPART OF THE SAME PARTY OR CERTAINLY THE SAME PARTY AS\nCURRENTLY CONSTITUTED. IF TRUMP LOSES, IT WILL BE AN\nINTERESTING QUESTION. I THINK THERE'S ROOM FOR THE\nDIFFERENT ELEMENTS WE SAW IN THE ELECTION, NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH\nIS MAYBE RETHINKING AROUND ISSUES LIKE TRADE WHERE DONALD\nTRUMP DID HAVE A MESSAGE THAT WAS RESONATING WITH A LOT OF\nPEOPLE. MAYBE NOT FUNDAMENTALLY BECOMING\nAN ANTI-FREE TRADE PARTY BUT THINKING ABOUT THINKING MORE\nTHOUGHTFULLY ABOUT THOSE AFFECTED BY TRADE.\nTHESE ARE THINGS WE'LL START SEEING BY WEDNESDAY MORNING.\nI HOPE IF TRUMP LOSES, REPUBLICANS SAY THERE'S A PARTY\nWORTH SAVING INSTEAD OF STARTING SOMETHING NEW.\n>> I THINK THERE IS, BRYAN AND SUNLEN, IT'S VERY MUCH AN\nIMPORTANT REALITY FOR US TO TALK ABOUT, THE PEOPLE, THE MILLIONS\nOF PEOPLE THAT HAVE FELT LEFT BEHIND IN THIS ECONOMY AND\nCOUNTRY FOR FAR TOO LONG. AND EVEN IF YOU DISAGREE WITH\nDONALD TRUMP, EVEN IF YOU DESPISE HIM OF THE THING HE\nSAID, HE HAS BEEN THEIR VOICE. AND WHO IS THEIR VOICE AFTER HIM\nIF HE DOESN'T WIN? >> I'VE BEEN INTERVIEWING A LOT\nOF BEAT REPORTERS. I WANT TO GET THEIR CANDID\nASSE ASSESSMENT, AND ALL OF THEM SAID\nI DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THESE STATES OR IN THESE\nCOMMUNITIES, AND IN THE PACIFIC AREAS, THESE OVERLOOKED VOTERS.\n>> YOU'RE TALKING TO TRUMP SUPPORTERS TRY TO TAP IN WHY DO\nYOU SUPPORT THIS MAN? THERE'S A SENSE THAT HE GIVES\nTHEM A VOICE AND THEY HAVEN'T HAD THAT IN A LONG TIME.\nI CAN'T TELL YOU THE AMOUNT OF SUPPORTERS THAT SAID THEY\nHAVEN'T BEEN INVOLVED IN ELECTIONS PAST BUT THEY REALLY\nFELT LIKE THIS TIME THEY HAVE A STAKE IN IT BECAUSE THEY FEEL\nTHEY HAVE A HORSE IN THE GAME. >> THAT GOES TO THE QUESTION OF\nIS THERE THE SECRET TRUMP VOTER? >> I'M NOT SURE THERE IS.\nI THINK MOST TRUMP VOTERS HAVE NOW BEEN PRETTY VOCAL AND MANY\nPOLLSTERS ARE SAYING THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE A SURPRISE THAT WAY.\nMAYBE IN PENNSYLVANIA OR MICHIGAN, BUT I'M NOT CONVINCED?\n>> THAT MIGHT BE ALL YOU NEED. >> BUT ON THE OTHER QUESTION, I\nTHINK OF BARRY GOLDWATER. HE GETS KILLED IN 1964.\nIT GOES POORLY AND THEN ROND REAGAN COMES ON NEXT WITH A\nCLEANER LOOK, AND HE'LL BE PRESIDENT IN 1980.\nTHAT'S ONE THING THAT CAN HAPPEN.\nIF DONALD TRUMP IS DONE, BUT SOMEONE CONTINUES WITH HIS\nMESSAGE IN A MORE POLITICALLY ASTUTE WAY.\n>> QUICKLY, LAURA, REGARDLESS OF WHO WINS DOES COMEY SERVE UNTIL\n2023? >> HE HAS A TENURE THAT'S\nINTENDED TO OUTLAST THE POLITICAL SPHERE.\nWE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE FBI IS NOT POLITICAL.\nWHEN HE RAISED THE RED FLAG TEN DAYS BEFORE AND LOWERED IT TWO\nDAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION, IT JUST REALLY UNDERMINED HIS\nINTEGRITY, AND THE FBI IN GENERAL.\n>> I'D READ THAT BOOK, THE BOOK HE WRITES AFTER THIS.\nTHANK YOU GUYS. LA\nLAURA, SUNLEN, BRYAN, JULIAN, LONNIE.\nYOU ARE TROOPERS. DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER\nWAS ON CNN A SHORT TIME AGO. SHE SPOKE WITH ANDERSON COOPER.\nWE WANT TO PLAY YOU PART OF THEIR CONVERSATION, ESPECIALLY\nTHIS. ACCUSATIONS FROM OFFICIALS IN\nTHE REPUBLICAN PARTY THAT EARLY VOTING IN SOME STATES IS BEING\nRUN IN A WAY THAT IS UNFAIR TO DONALD TRUMP.\nHERE'S PART OF THE CONVERSATION. >> LAST NIGHT AT A TRUMP RALLY\nTHE CHAIRMAN OF THE NEVADA REPUBLICAN PARTY MADE A CLAIM\nTHAT POLLING PLACES IN CLARKE COUNTY WERE KEPT OPEN LATE SO A\nCERTAIN GROUP COULD VOTE, IN HIS WORDS.\nWHEN YOU WERE ASKED ABOUT THAT EARLIER YOU REFERENCED SPECIAL\nRULES FOR DEMOCRATIC VOTERS. DO YOU HAVE ANY EVIDENCE TO BACK\nTHAT CLAIM UP THAT DEMOCRATIC VOTERS ARE GETTING SPECIAL\nFAVORS? >> NO, NOT IN THIS INSTANCE.\nI WAS JUST MAKING THE CASE THAT THAT WE'RE WATCHING THAT.\nAND WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT POLLS SHOULD BE OPEN PAST THE MINUTE\nTHEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE AND SPECIAL FAVORS SHOULD NOT BE\nGRANTED. >> AND PEOPLE ARE IN LINE.\n>> GREAT. GREAT, BUT FOLKS WILL BE\nWATCHING. THERE ARE PEOPLE WATCHING.\nI KNOW HILLARY CLINTON HAS PEOPLE WATCHING.\nWE JUST WANT FAIRNESS, IN FAIRNESS, WE ARE UP AGAINST A\nWOMAN AND A MACHINE THAT STOPS AT NOTHING TO GET HER WAY.\nIT'S ALWAYS HILLARY FIRST. THE CORRUPTION, THE ETHICS, THE\nSTOP AT NOTHING TO ADVANCE HER INTEREST IS VERY CLEAR, AND SO\nWE'RE JUST WATCHING. BUT IF PEOPLE ARE ALREADY IN\nLINE AND WANTED TO VOTE, FINE. WE'RE HAPPY WITH THE RETURNS\nFROM THE EARLY VOTING IN MOST STATES.\n>> DON'T FACTS MATTER? IF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE NEVADA\nREPUBLICAN PARTY IS MAKING THIS CLAIM THAT POLLING PLACES IN\nCLARKE COUNTY KEPT OPEN SO A CERTAIN GROUP COULD VOTE.\nTHOSE WERE VOTERS IN LINE ON TIME TO VOTE.\nWHY IMPLY THAT IT'S THIS CERTAIN GROUP?\n>> I THINK HE WAS REFERRING TO THE WORKERS WHO WERE, I BELIEVE,\nEITHER ON BREAK OR AFTER THEIR SHIFT TRYING TO VOTE, FROM WHAT\nI NUNDERSTAND. HE'S MAKING THE POINT IF THIS\nHAPPEN THEN IT WILL BE NOTED. HONESTLY, WE'RE RUNNING AGAINST\nHILLARY CLINTON AND HER CREW, AND WE'RE GOING TO FACT CHECK\nWHAT WE SAY AND NOT THEM. THAT'S RICH.\nFOR EVERYTHING FROM JIM COMEY SHOULD RESIGN TO HE'S LYING TO\nHE'S A REPUBLICAN SO HE'S THE WORST PERSON EVER, AND NOW HE'S\nDONE THE RIGHT THING. >> THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED.\nISN'T THAT EXACTLY WHAT YOU GUYS DID?\nI AGREE IT'S HYPOCRITICAL OF DEMOCRATS IN JULY TO PRAISE HIM\nAND THEN GO AFTER HIM WHEN THINGS DON'T TURN OUT THEIR WAY.\nBUT ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU WERE DOING?\n>> MAKE COMEY GREAT AGAIN. >> YOU GUYS WERE DOING THE SAME\nTHING. DONALD TRUMP WAS SAYING THE SHIP\nWAS RIGHTED. HE'S GOT BACK HIS REPUTATION.\nIS HE GOING TO SAY THE SAME THING NOW?\nDOES HE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN COMEY IF HE BECOMES PRESIDENT?\n>> THIS DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACTS WE KNOW HE LIED AND LIED A\nHOBBIT HOW MANY GUYS AND THE CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.\n>> DOES YOUR CANDIDATE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE FBI DIRECTOR?\n>> I WILL TELL YOU THIS DOESN'T CHANGE THE SIMPLE FACT WHICH IS\nTHIS INVESTIGATION WAS BUNGLED FROM THE BEGINNING.\nTHAT'S OBVIOUS. OTHERWISE TODAY WOULDN'T BE THE\nDAY WE WOULD FIND OUT SHE WAS ASKED ABOUT MADE TO PRINT\nINFORMATION. THAT'S NEW INFORMATION.\n>> A NEW YORK POST STORY WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM IT.\n>> IT WAS NOT KNOWN TO US PREVIOUSLY.\nWE KNOW THAT HILLARY CLINTON LEFT CLASSIFIED INFORMATION OR\nINFORMATION AT A HOTEL IN CHINA AND HUMA ABEDIN HAD INFORMATION\nIN FRONT SEAT OF HER CAR. IT'S SLOPPY AND THINGS WERE\nMISHANDLED. NONE OF THAT CHANGES.\nWE ALSO KNOW THAT THEY LIE ALL THE TIME.\nHOW HAVE WE TIGHTENED THE POLLS? MR. TRUMP IS OUT TALKING ABOUT\nOBAMA CARE. THE 26 OR 27 TIMES PRESIDENT\nOBAMA LIED. >> THEY'RE CHANTING LOCK HER UP.\nIT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE GOING HIGH EITHER.\n>> I JUST SAY PROP HER UP. I FIND IT VERY CURIOUS SHE\nTHINKS PEOPLE ARE AT THESE RALLIES TO SEE HER AND NOT THE\nSTARS. WE KNOW WHO THEY'RE THERE TO\nSEE. WHEN SHE'S BY HERSELF --\n>> ISN'T TED NEW JERSEY ET GOING OUT WITH YOUR CANDIDATE?\n>> POSSIBLY, BUT PEOPLE COME TO SEE DONALD TRUMP.\nWE KNOW THAT. IN MINNESOTA TODAY WE POSTED THE\nEVENT AND WITHIN 16 OR 18 HOURS WE HAD 22,000 RSVPs.\n>> IT'S INCREDIBLE. >> BUT WE KNOW THE MEDIA WILL\nASK, BUT WILL THEY VOTE? NO THAT, THEY PARK THEIR CAR A\nMILE AWAY AND WALK IN THE RAIN TO BE AT THE RALLY.\nOF COURSE THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE. >> WE'VE BEEN SAYING THAT ALL\nALONG. THE ENTHUSIASM YOU GUYS HAVE IN\nTHE TENS OF THOUSANDS THAT SHOW UP.\nSOCIAL S IT'S INCREDIBLE.\nIT'S LIKE A CONCERT.

THE DECISION GOES BACK TO TWO\nEVENTS LAST SUMMER. NUMBER ONE, THE FBI AND FBI\nDIRECTOR'S DECISION TO COME OUT PUBLICLY IN THE CASE.\nTHE FBI TYPICALLY DOESN'T DO THAT.\nWHEN COMEY DID THAT, HE FORCED HIMSELF NOW MONTHS LATER TO SAY\nWHEN I TOLD YOU IT WAS CLOSED PUBLICLY, I HAVE TO SAY IT IS\nREOPENED PUBLICLY. THE SECOND THING WE ARE NOT\nTALKING ABOUT IS LORETTA LYNCH'S DECISION TO MEET BILL CLINTON ON\nTHE TARMAC.

COMEY WAS PUT IN A SITUATION OF\nWEARING TWO HATS AS PROSECUTOR AND MAIN CRIMINAL INVESTIGATOR.\nHE DID THAT PART. NOW WE HAVE THE SECOND\nITERATION. IT COMES TO THE FALLOUT OF THIS.\nPEOPLE GET A FINAL LOOK AT HOW CLINTON AND TRUMP DEAL WITH THE\nSITUATION. FOR TRUMP'S PART.\nHE SAID IT IS RIGGED. COMEY IS OBVIOUSLY IN THE BAG\nFOR CLINTON. YOU CANNOT GO THROUGH THAT MANY\nE-MAILS THAT FAST. >> YES, YOU CAN.\nFIRST OF ALL, THEY ARE DETERMINING HOW MANY ARE\nDUPLICATES. THAT IS AN ELECTRONIC PROCESS.\nYOU DON'T NEED A HUMAN BEING.

HE WAS SWORN IN THREE YEARS AGO.\nSHE CANNOT FIRE HIM. SHE HAS TO THROW HER ARMS AROUND\nHIM OR ICE HIM OUT SO MUCH THAT HE SAYS I'M DONE WITH THIS.\nIN MY JUDGMENT, THE BEST SOLUTION IS HE HAS A TERRIFIC\nREPUTATION, STILL IN WASHINGTON, THE BEST SITUATION IS HE DOESN'T\nPUT OUT THE WORD THAT THE NEW PRESIDENT-ELECT IF IT IS HILLARY\nCLINTON, HAS SQUEEZED HIM OUT.

HE DIDN'T MENTION THE LAPTOP,\nBUT HE SAID NEW EVIDENCE WAS PRESENTED.\nTHIS MAY BE A BIGGER DEAL JUST TWO DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION.\nI HAVE THE LETTER FROM JAMES COMEY.\nHE SAID WE SENT THAT LETTER SINCE MY LETTER, THE FBI\nINVESTIGATIVE TEAM IS WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK TO PROCESS AND\nREVIEW A LARGE VOLUME OF E-MAILS FROM A DEVICE AGAIN THE LAPTOP\nOBTAINED IN CONNECTION WITH AN UNRELATED CRIMINAL\nINVESTIGATION. DURING THAT PROCESS, WE REVIEWED\nALL THE COMMUNICATIONS THAT WERE TO OR FROM HILLARY CLINTON WHILE\nSHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE BASED ON OUR REVIEW, JAMES COMEY SAYS,\nWE HAVE NOT CHANGED OUR CONCLUSIONS THAT WE EXPRESSED IN\nJULY WITH RESPECT TO SECRETARY CLINTON.\nI'M VERY GRATEFUL TO THE PROFESSIONALS AT THE FBI DOING\nAN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF WORK. AGAIN, A LITTLE CRYPTIC.\nDOESN'T DIRECTLY SAY SHE'S IN THE CLEAR.\nBUT IF THE FIRST LETTER ON OCTOBER 28th WAS CORRECTLY\nINTERRUPTED, THAT THE FBI RESTARTING THE ENGINES,\nCERTAINLY FAIR TO SUGGEST NEW THAT THIS LETTER IS A SIGNAL\nFROM DIRECTOR COMEY THAT MAYBE THOSE ENGINES ARE --\n>> SO WE'RE WATCHING THE TRUMP PLAIN PULL UP TO THE AIRPLANE\nHANGAR IN MINNEAPOLIS. TECHNICALLY SPEAKING, THE\nINVESTIGATION WAS NEVER CLOSED.

IT'S NOT OFFICIALLY CLOSED.\nTHAT'S WHAT WE BELIEVE IN LATE OCTOBER.\nBUT I THINK AGAIN TO FOLLOW THE FACTS AND NOT TO SPIT ON EITHER\nSIDE, IF WE'RE GOING TO FOLLOW THIS WITH WHAT HAPPENED ON\nOCTOBER 28th, WHICH WAS POTENTIALLY VERY DAMAGING TO\nHILLARY CLINTON, AGAIN, DON'T WANT TO GET AHEAD OFF YOURSEF O,\nBUT THIS COULD POTENTIALLY BE A BIG SIGH OF RELIEF FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON. >> AND IF JAMES COMEY FEELS THAT\nHE INJECTED HIMSELF INTO THE POLITICAL DIALOGUE HERE, THIS\nLATEST STATEMENT WHICH JUST CAME OUT WOULD SERVE IN SOME WAYS TO\nNEUTRALIZE THAT. HE'S BASICALLY SAYING I LOOKED\nAT WHAT THEY HAD AS I PROMISED, I WOULD UPDATE THE AMERICAN\nPEOPLE AND CONGRESS IF THERE WERE ANY DEVELOPMENTS.\nSO I CAME FORWARD, THERE WERE NEW DEVELOPMENTS AND THEY HAVE\nBEEN WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK AND SO FAR I DON'T SEE ANYTHING\nTHAT WILL CHANGE OUR CONCLUSION FROM JULY.\nSO HOW MUCH OF THIS IS AN EVIDENT IN THAT REGARD.\n>> WELL, THIS COULD BE SEEN BECAUSE IT WAS SEEN ON OCTOBER\n28th BY SOME AS CYA FOR NOT DOING ANYTHING IN JULY AND THEN\nOKAY, WE'VE GOTTEN THE DOOR OPEN AGAIN ON OCTOBER 28th.\nAND REMEMBER, VERY SENIOR REPUBLICANS WITH REAL STANDING\nON THESE MATTERS SAID LOOK, THERE IS NO WAY JAMES COMEY\nAFTER TAKING A POUNDING IN JULY IS GOING TO COME BACK TO US AND\nSAY THIS IS REOPENED, RESTARTED, WHATEVER WORD YOU WANT TO USE\nAND THEN HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.\nTHERE HAD TO BE SOMETHING SERIOUS HE LEARNED ON OCTOBER\n27th, 28th TO TAKE SUCH A BIG STEP SO CLOSE TO THE ELECTION.\nWELL, I'VE GOT IT SAY BASED ON REPUBLICAN BOB GOODLATT'S\nREASONS, IT CERTAINLY APPEARS THAT JAMES COMEY IS SAYING WHAT\nBOB GOODLATT FEARED HE WOULD NT SAY, WHICH IS THAT IT WASN'T A\nBIG DEAL, SO I'M NOT CHANGING MY MIND.\nSO I THINK THIS COULD BE A BIGGER HEAD SCRATCHER IN TERMS\nOF COMEY'S LEGACY. HE GOT HAMMERED AGAIN IN OCTOBER\nBY DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS IN JULY, DEMOCRAT AS COUPLE WEEKS\nAGO SAYING WHY ARE YOU ENTER ENTER JESHLGTING INTO THE\nELECTION. AND NOW TWO DAYS BEFORE THE\nELECTION WHEN HILLARY CLINTON APPEARS TO BE STRUGGLING TO THE\nFINISH LINE HERE FOR COMEY TO INSERT HIMSELF AGAIN, THIS IS A\nBIG DEAL. >> ODD IN SOME WAYS.\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THAT, HE COULD HAVE JUST HUNG BACK AND\nALLOWED THE INVESTIGATION TO CONTINUE.\nI THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE THE ASSESSMENT IS THAT THE IMPACT OF\nTHAT ON THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAD EVENED OUT.\nWE'RE WATCHING THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN PLANE AND THERE WAS A\nREPORT ABOUT HOW ALL THIS NEWS HAD SUNK IN THAT FRIDAY\nAFTERNOON WHEN THEY STARTED TO SEE THIS CROSS AND NOW THAT\nTHEY'RE LANDING IN MINNESOTA AND THEY'RE SEEING THIS LATEST NEWS\nCROSS OVER, YOU WONDER WHAT IS  >> AND PRESIDENT OBAMA IN THESE\nFINAL HOURS IS ADDING A STOP TO MICHIGAN TOMORROW WHICH THE\nDEMOCRATS ARE SUDDENLY WORRIED ABOUT.\nAND LET'S REMEMBER WHAT HE CAN LAST WEEK.\nHE WENT OUT THERE AND SAID MAYBE THIS WASN'T A BIG DEAL AND\nUNFAIR TO HILLARY CLINTON. WHAT PRESSURE ON JAMES COMEY WAS\nCOMING FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA'S COMMENTS NUMBER ONE AND THE FACT\nTHAT LORETTA LYNCH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND HER OFFICIALS THERE\nAT THE OBAMA JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAD SUGGESTED IN RECENT DAYS\nTHEY TRIED TO STOP JAMES COMEY OR URGED HIM DON'T TELL CONGRESS\nABOUT THIS STUFF. THAT POLITICAL ISSUE MIGHT BE\nOUT THERE, AS WELL. >> ANOTHER BIG TWIST.\n>> AND PRESIDENT OBAMA IS IN FLORIDA AND WE'LL MONITOR THAT\nAND SEE IF THERE IS ANY REACTION ON THIS.\nIN THE MEANTIME, KATIE AND JESSICA ARE JOINING US.\nWE BROUGHT YOU INTO TALK WITH SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY, BUT WITH\nTHE BREAKING NEWS, WHAT IS THE EFFECT NOW, 36 HOURS BEFORE THE\nPOLLS OPEN? IF THERE IS ONE.\n>> WELL, IF THERE IS ANY VOTERS LEFT UNDECIDED ON THIS SPECIFIC\nISSUE, THAT CERTAINLY PUT THIS IS ASIDE IN TERMS OF WONDERING\nWHAT THE FBI FOUND. I THINK IT'S CLEAR FROM DIRECTOR\nCOMEY'S POSITION THAT HE DID EVERYTHING HE COULD TO GET THIS\nDONE BEFORE THE ELECTION. HE FELT HE HAD TO GET THE\nINFORMATION ABOUT WHAT WAS FOUND OUT BEFORE THE ELECTION AND I\nTHINK THAT WE NEED TO APPLAUD THE FBI AGENTS WHO WORKED HARD\nTO MAKE SURE THAT VOTERS HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION THAT THEY\nNEED GOING INTO ELECTION DAY. THAT BEING SAID, I THINK IT'S\nIMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE FBI, THIS IS\nABOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTIN STONE WALLING THE FBI BECAUSE\nTHE FBI DOESN'T HAVE THE POWER . WITHOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF\nJUSTICE, A GRAND JURY, THE FBI  SO WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS FOUND,\nBUT BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT THE FBI HAD EARLIER, WE\nWON'T SEE ANYTHING. >> COMEY HAD HAS SAID THERE WAS CLASSIFIED INFORMATION ON THAT\nSERVER. >> ABSOLUTELY.\n>> BUT HE SAID DOES IT FIT THE DEFINITION OF INTENT.\nI CAME BACK TO THAT REPEATEDLY SO PERHAPS HE AGAIN CONCLUDED\nTHAT THERE WAS NO INTENT TO CAUSE HARM TO NATIONAL SECRET.\nNOW, JESSICA, GO AHEAD AND ANALYZE THIS THIS AS YOU'RE\nHEARING THE NEWS FOR THE FIRST TIME.\n>> WELL, UNFORTUNATELY I THINK THAT THE DAMAGE HAS BEEN DONE IN\nA LOT OF WAYS OTHER THE LAST WEEK OF SPECULATION OF TRUMP\nOBVIOUSLY USING THIS OVER AND OVER TO REINFORCE HIS MESSAGE\nTHAT HILLARY SHOULD BE IN JAIL. SO I THINK WHAT HAPPENED IS IT\nDAMPENED A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO NOW THIS IS THE LAST DAY FOR EARLY\nVOTING IN MANY STATES INCLUDING HERE IN FLORIDA.\nAND IT VOTER ENTHUSIASM. BECAUSE THERE HAS ALREADY BEEN\nTHE ISSUE OF DO PEOPLE TRUST HILLARY.\nSO PEOPLE ON THE BORDER OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY WOULD VOTE\nFOR HER, TRUMP OR STAY HOME, A LOT OF PEOPLE I THINK HAS BEEN\nSTAYING HOME IN THAT SENSE. >> IF THAT IS THE CASE -- HANG\nON, JESS. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THREE,\nFOUR, FIVE HOURS MAYBE DEPENDING ON THE TIME ZONE YOU'RE INTO GET\nTHIS NEWS AND DIGEST IT. IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S BAKED IN ONE\nWAY ARE THE OTHER. >> I THINK ALREADY PEOPLE HAVE\nSTAYED HOME IF THEY'RE GOING TO DO EARLY VOTING.\nTHEY WILL CHANGE THEIR MIND AT GET OUT ON ELECTION DAY OR THE\nDAMAGE HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE. I THINK THAT LETTER SHOWS THAT\nIT WAS A NOTHING BURGER. I'M NOT SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES IN\nCONSPIRACY THEORY, HOWEVER IT HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT ABOUT\nREPEATEDLY ABOUT HOW INTERNALLY THIS IN THE FBI THERE ARE PEOPLE\nWHO ARE VERY AGAINST CLINTON OR VERY PRO TRUMP AND I THINK THIS\nPLAYS IN TO THAT MESSAGE AND IT WILL NOT BE --\n>> OR PERHAPS THEY SEE -- HANG ON.\nOR PERHAPS THEY SEE THE EVIDENCE DEFINITELY.\n>> THE IDEA THAT THERE IS NO INDICTMENT IS ABSURD.\nWE HAVE PLENTY OF EVIDENCE THROUGH WIKILEAKS AND THE\nREPORTS THAT HILLARY CLINTON PUT NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE UNITED\nSTATES BELOW THE PRIOR DIFFERENCE OF HER OPEN PRIVACY\nAND WHAT THEY CALLS CONVENIENCE TO EVADE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION\nACT LAWS. AND GOING AROUND THE POLICIES OF\nTHE STATE DEPARTMENT AND OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAD FOR E-MAIL\nPRACTICES. THIS ISN'T ABOUT JAMES COMEY\nJUMPING INTO THE ELECTION OR HAVING AN EFFECT IN THE LAST\nWEEK. THIS IS ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON IN\nTHE BEGINNING BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING THE DECISION TO SET\nUP A PRIVATE SERVER. SHE DID TO HERSELF.\nIT'S UNFORTUNATE FOR HER THAT IT CAME OUT A WEEK BEFORE THE\nELECTION, BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN  RULES.\nAND SO PEOPLE THINK SHE'S A LIAR AND THIS WON'T CHANGE ANYTHING.\n>> DO YOU THINK TRUMP SAYS ANYTHING ABOUT THIS NOW?\nBECAUSE YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THE WAY THAT SHE AND\nLEADING DEMOCRATS WENT AFTER COMEY.\n>> I THINK TRUMP WOULD DO WELL NOT GOING AFTER COMEY, BUT I\nTHINK HE WILL CONTINUE TO BRING THIS UP.\nBECAUSE WHEN THE INITIAL ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE IN JULY,\nTHE MAJORITY OF COUNTRY BELIEVED THAT SHE SHOULD BE INDICTED\nINCLUDING DEMOCRATS. SO PEOPLE STILL BELIEVE\nACCORDING TO POLLING THAT SHE COMMITTED A CRIME.\nAND THE EVIDENCE IS CLEAR. AND THE FEELING IS THAT THE\nCLINTONS AGAIN AFTER DECADES ARE ABOVE THE LAW AND THAT THEY'RE\nNEVER HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR ANYTHING.\n>> THAT IS ABSURD. I DON'T KNOW WHAT POLLING YOU'RE\nREFERRING TO. I THINK THAT IS INSANE.\nIT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT YOU WOULD SAY FROM THAT WE SAY IT BASED\nON -- >> BUT I DIDN'T SAY --\n>> I THINK THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT IN THIS MATTER.\nAND IN OUR COUNTRY GOING FORWARD.\n>> AS DO I. >> IT'S IMPORTANT IN THIS\nELECTION. WE DO NOT -- YOU CAN MAKE A\nPOLITICAL DECISION BASED ON SOMETHING, NFORTUNATELY EVEN\nBASED ON LIES. BUT YOU DON'T MAKE PROSECUTORIAL\nDECISIONS BASED ON PUBLIC OPINION.\n>> NO ONE IS ARGUING THAT. >> WE'LL GET AN IDEA OF THIS\nAROUND 5:00 IN THE AFTERNOON ON TUESDAY WHEN WE ALL GO INSIDE OF\nA ROOM THAT IS QUARANTINED AND WE SEE THE EXIT POLLING.\nAND YOU HAVE TO THINK THAT THIS WILL BE ONE OF THE QUESTIONS\nTHAT WILL BE GIVEN TO VOTERS. AND VARIOUS BATTLEGROUND STATES.\nDID THIS HAVE AN IMPACT ON YOUR VOTE.\nAND I THINK THAT IS WHEN WE'LL KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THIS STORY\nDID INFLUENCE ANYONE. >> ABSOLUTELY.\n>> YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE EARLY VOTING IN FLORIDA, NORTH\nCAROLINA, IT IS RAZOR TIGHT, SO WE WILL SEE ON TUESDAY.\nBY THE WAY THE LETTER FROM COMEY CONCLUDES THE FOLLOWING WAY.\nI'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE PROFESSIONAL OF THE FBI FOR\nDOING AN EXTRA AMOUNT OF HIGH QUALITY WORK IN A SHORT PERIOD\nOF TIME. AND AS I SAY THAT, HERE IS\nDONALD TRUMP IN MINNEAPOLIS. WHAT WILL HE SAY?\nWE'RE ON STANDBY. THIS THE SECOND OF FIVE EVENTS\nTODAY FOR TRUMP. HE WAS IN IOWA LAST HOUR, NOW\nMINNEAPOLIS. FROM THERE HE WILL GO FOR\nMICHIGAN NORTHEAST OF THE DETROIT.\nAND THEN IT'S PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA.\nAND THEN LEESBURG, VIRGINIA. ALL FIVE OF THOSE STATES THERE,\nBARACK OBAMA WON IOWA TWICE, TRUMP NEEDS TO FLIP IOWA THIS\nYEAR. MINNESOTA HASN'T GONE REPUBLICAN\nSINCE 1972. AND YET HERE HE IS WALKING\nACROSS THE TARMAC IN MICHIGAN AND IN PENNSYLVANIA PA.\nTHEY BOTH HAVE NOT GONE P REPUBLICAN SINCE 1988.\nAND IN VIRGINIA, YOU REMEMBER BARACK OBAMA FLIPPED VIRGINIA\nFIRST TIME IN 50 YEARS THEY WENT DEMOCRAT AND HELD IT JUST FOUR\nYEARS LATER. SO HERE IS TRUMP.\nWE'LL SEE HOW HE REACTS IN A MOMENT IT WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH\nTHE FBI, IF THERE IS ANY REACTION AT ALL.\nAND MARTHA WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE REPORTING\nBEHIND THE SCENES ABOUT HOW THEY HEARD ABOUT THE COMEY DECISION A\nWEEK AGO. AND TOOK QUITE A LONG TIME TO\nFIGURE OUT HOW THEY WERE GOING TO ADDRESS IT.\nSO WE'LL SEE WHAT THE EFFECT OF THIS IS NOW.\nDONALD TRUMP, MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA.\nHERE WE GO. >> THANK YOU. SO YOU WON'T BELIEVE THIS, THERE\nARE THREE TIMES MORE PEOPLE STANDING OVER THERE THAN OVER\nHERE. SO THEN I ASK THE SIMPLE\nQUESTION, WHOEVER SAID THIS DEAL UP, WHY DIDN'T THEY MOVE THIS\nOUT TO THERE SO THAT THOSE PEOPLE COULD HAVE BEEN OVER\nHERE. RIGHT?\nWHO ARE THE GENIUSES THAT SET THIS UP?\nTHAT'S TOO BAD. THAT'S TOO BAD.\nI FEEL SO BADLY. THERE ARE THOUSANDS AND\nTHOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OVER THERE. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO PUT UP\nWITH IN LIFE, RIGHT? REAL GENIUSES.\nIT'S GREAT TO BE BACK IN MINNESOTA TODAY.\nSO IMPORTANT FOR ME TO COME HERE AND CAMPAIGN FOR YOUR VOTE.\nI'VE BEEN HERE MANY TIMES BEFORE AS YOU KNOW AND HILLARY DOESN'T\nEVEN -- I MEAN SHE DOESN'T EVEN BOTHER TO COME HERE.\nSHE SHOULD BE PENALIZED. DON'T VOTE FOR HER.\nSHE'LL BE A LOUSY PRESIDENT ANYWAY, BELIEVE ME.\nSHE REFUSES TO CAMPAIGN IN MINNESOTA. SO DO YOU REALLY WANT A\nPRESIDENT WHO DOESN'T CARE ABOUT YOUR VOTE AND DOESN'T SHOW UP?\nSHE NEVER CAME HERE. I'M ASKING FOR THE SUPPORT OF\nEVERY VOTER IN THE STATE, DEMOCRAT, REPUBLICAN,\nINDEPENDENT, FIRST TIME VOTERS OF WHICH THERE ARE MANY, MANY,\nMANY. WHO WANT TO TAKE OUR GOVERNMENT\nBACK FROM THE CORRUPT POLITICAL CLASS IN WASHINGTON, D.C.\nI'M ASKING FOR THE VOTES OF STUDENTS AND PARENTS AND RETIRED\nAMERICANS, UNION WORKERS, AFRICAN-AMERICANS, HISPANIC\nAMERICANS, AND ALL AMERICANS WHO ARE TIRED OF A GOVERNMENT THAT\nWORKS FOR WALL STREET AND THE SPECIAL INTERESTS BUT NOT FOR\nTHE PEOPLE. NOT FOR THE PEOPLE.\nIT'S TIME FOR ALL AMERICANS TO UNITE AND TAKE BACK OUR\nGOVERNMENT. I'M VERY HONORED TO HAVE WON THE\nMOCK VOTE OF THE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN MINNESOTA.\nYOU KNOW THAT THING WAS ALL OVER THE NATION.\nPROBABLY ONE OF THE REASONS I'M HERE.\nWE'RE DOING INCREDIBLY IN THE MINUTE.\nPOLLS. BUT EVERYBODY KEPT TELLING ME\nDID YOU HEAR YOU WON THE HIGH SCHOOL VOTE IN MINNESOTA.\nAND I WAS LIKE NO, TELL ME ABOUT IT.\nWELL, KIDS NO BETTER THAN WE DO, RIGHT?\nHEY, HERE IS A GREAT VET RIGHT HERE.\nTHIS ELECTION IS ALL ABOUT CREATING BETTER FUTURE FOR OUR\nCHILDREN. WE HAVE A DISASTER OVERSEAS.\nTHE WARS WE HE NEVER WIN. WE'RE TIRED OF ECONOMIC AND\nFOREIGN POLICIES THAT HAVE BLED OUR COUNTRY DRY.E NEVER WIN.\nWE'RE TIRED OF ECONOMIC AND FOREIGN POLICIES THAT HAVE BLED\nOUR COUNTRY DRY. NEVER WIN. WE'RE TIRED OF ECONOMIC AND\nFOREIGN POLICIES THAT HAVE BLED OUR COUNTRY DRY.NEVER WIN.\nWE'RE TIRED OF ECONOMIC AND FOREIGN POLICIES THAT HAVE BLED\nOUR COUNTRY DRY. WE OWE $20 TRILLION.\nIT'S TIME FOR REAL CHANGE THAT PUTS PEOPLE BACK IN CHARGE AND\nPUTS OUR PEOPLE BACK TO WORK AGAIN.\nIT ELECTION WILL DECIDE WHO RUNS OUR COUNTRY, THE CORRUPT\nPOLITICAL CLASS OR YOU THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\nTHAT'S THE CHOICE. SHE'S WITH THEM, I'M WITH YOU.\nI USED TO BE ON THE OTHER SIDE FOR A LONG TIME.\nBUT I LOVE THIS COUNTRY. AND I SAW WHAT WAS HAPPENING.\nNOT ON THAT THE WRONG DIRECTION, OUR COUNTRY WAS GOING TO HELL.\nIT WAS GOING TO HELL. THE IRAN DEAL, SO MANY THINGS.\nYOU COULD GO OVER THIS ONE BY ONE AND WE'LL DISCUSS SOME OF\nTHEM RIGHT NOW. BUT I CAN TELL YOU THIS, THIS IS\nOUR LAST CHANCE. FOUR YEAR, YOU CAN FORGET IT.\nBY THAT TIME YOU'LL HAVE SUPREME COURT JUDGES PICKED, FOUR YEARS\nYOU CAN FORGET IT. YOU'LL NEVER HAVE ANOTHER SHOT.\nTHIS IS IT. SO WE HAVE TO GET OUT, WE HAVE\nTO VOTE. AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE.\nBECAUSE I TOOK A LOT OF HEAT. I CAME TO MINNESOTA, I TOOK SO\nMUCH HEAT. THEY ALL SAID WHY IS HE GOING TO MINNESOTA?\nTHEY HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT FOR TWO YEARS.\nSO FAR IN TWO YEARS I'VE BEEN RIGHT, THEY HAVE BEEN WRONG.\nTHEY HAVE BEEN SAYING I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S GOING TO MINNESOTA.\nYOU KNOW, REAL GENIUSES. I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S GOING TO\nMINNESOTA. WHY WOULD HE BE DOING THAT?\nWHY? HE SHOULD BE ELSEWHERE.\nHE SHOULD BE AND AS I SAID, HILLARY CLINTON HAS NOT BEEN\nHERE ONCE. BUT HE SHOULD BE NOT BE IN\nMINNESOTA. I LOVE MINNESOTA.HERE, BECAUSE\nI KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. IN TWO YEARS WE ARE GOING TO WIN\nTHE GREAT STATE OF MINNESOTA. AND WE ARE GOING TO WIN BACK THE\nWHITE HOUSE. REAL CHANGE BEGINS IMMEDIATELY\nREPEALING AND REPLACING OBAMACARE.\nIT'S A DISASTER. THE RESIDENTS OF MINNESOTA WILL\nEXPERIENCE CLOSE TO A 60% RATE INCREASE IN YOUR PREMIUMS.\nGOING TO GO A LOT HIGHER THAN THAT.\nEVERY SINGLE COUNTY IN MINNESOTA IS LOSING.\nAND LOSING BIG IN SO MANY WAYS. BUT YOU'RE LOSING ALL OF YOUR\nINSURER, YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT? THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR OF YOUR\nSTATE WHO PUSHED FOR THIS HORRIBLE HEALTH CARE SAID THE\nAFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS NO LONGER AFFORDABLE.\nTHAT IS YOUR GOVERNOR. COMPANIES ARE LEAVING.\nINSURERS ARE FLEEING. DOCTORS ARE QUITTING AND\nDEDUCTIBLES ARE GOING THROUGH THE ROOF.\nYOU HAVE $17,000 IN DEDUCTIBLES. YET HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO\nDOUBLE DOWN ON OBAMACARE MAKING IT EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE.\nIT WILL BE DOUBLE. I'M ASKING FOR YOUR VOTE SO WE\nCAN BRING SANITY TO THE PROCESS,", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1478468728670.1478465539643.afb5408a-5146-4aa0-b1ee-79adaa3b921c.segment4.thumb.jpg", "channel": "360"}, {"start": 557122, "length": 857657.0, "end": 1414779, "date": 1478467417441, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1478470068160.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1478467342452-4b90ea73-da64-42bd-b46a-efb0c8cd0698-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=557.12,1414.78", "text": ">>> A BIG SURPRISE TODAY A\nLITTLE MORE THAN A WEEK AND A HALF AFTER GETTING THE LAST\nSURPRISE THAT WAS THE WIND AT HIS BACK.\nJAMES COMEY HAS JUST DONE ANOTHER 180.\nTHE LATEST BATCH OF CLINTON E-MAIL, INTO BIG DEAL, NOTHING THAT WOULD WARN REOPENING THE\nOLD PROBE. IF YOU'RE CONFUSED, YOU'RE NOT\nALONE. THE SYSTEM REMAINS RIGGED.\nED HENRY FOLLOWING ALL THE DEVELOPMENTS.\nED. >> VERY INTERESTING DONALD TRUMP\nWHO LIKE JAMES COMEY MIGHT NOW SAY HE'S PART OF A RIGGED SYSTEM\nAND HILLARY CLINTON WHO DISLIKED JAMES COMEY APPEARS TO LIKE HIM\nAGAIN NOW. THIS IS A TRAUMATIC TURN OF\nEVENTS. OCTOBER 28th, REMEMBER JAMES\nCOMEY APPEARED TO BE OPENING THE DOOR TO REVERSING WHAT HE HAD\nSAID IN JULY WHEN HE HAD THE REALLY REMARKABLE NEWS\nCONFERENCE RIGHT SMACK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SUMMER AS THE\nCONVENTIONS WERE ABOUT TO HEAT UP, SAYING THERE WERE\nPOTENTIALLY BAD ACTORS AND IT APPEARED THAT SHE HAD MISHANDLED\nCLASSIFIED INFORMATION. BUT SAID THAT BASED ON INTENT,\nHE DID NOT THINK ANY PROSECUTOR WOULD ACTUALLY BRING CRIMINAL\nCHARGES AGAINST CLINTON. HUGE SIGH OF RELIEF FOR THE\nCLINTON CAMP THEN. REPUBLICANS WERE FURIOUS.\nTHEN TAX FORWARD TO OCTOBER 28, THE HISTORIC LET FRER COMEY TO\nLEADERS IN CONGRESS, BOTH PARTIES BY THE WAY EVEN THOUGH\nHILLARY CLINTON CLAIMED THEY ONLY WENT TO REPUBLICAN LEADER,\nIN WHICH HE SAID WAIT A SECOND, WE HAVE SOMETHING NEW AND THEN\nWE HAD ANOTHER TWIST WHICH IS WE FOUND OUT WHAT WAS NEW.\nIT WAS ANTHONY WEINER'S LAPTOP SUGGESTING THAT THERE WERE\nHUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MORE E-MAILS INVOLVING HUMA ABEDIN\nTHAT WERE NOT BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE FBI.\nTHAT DREW HOWELLS OF PROTEST FROM THE CLINTON CAMP SAYING\nTHAT THE INVESTIGATION WAS REOPENED LESS THAN TWO WEEKS\nFROM THE LESS THAT THIS WAS A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE.\nJUST MOMENTS AGO, JAMES COMEY TWO DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION\nWEIGHING IN YET AGAIN SAYING, QUOTE, BASED ON OUR REVIEW, WE\nHAVE NOT CHANGED OUR CONCLUSION THAT WE EXPRESSED IN JULY WITH\nRESPECT TO HILLARY CLINTON. I'M VERY GRATEFUL HE SAYS TO THE\nPROFESSIONALS AT THE FBI FOR DOING AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF\nHIGH QUALITY WORK IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.\nA LITTLE BIT CRYPTIC WHEN HE SAID WE HAVEN'T CHANGED OUR\nCONCLUSIONS. HE DOES NOT AND I THAT THE\nINVESTIGATION IS CLOSED OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.\nHE'S JUST SAYING WE'RE NOT CHANGING WHAT WE SAID IN JULY\nTHAT WE WILL NOT SUGGEST THERE BE CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST\nHILLARY CLINTON. AND CLINTON CAMP IS TAKING IT AS\nA VICTORY. THEY WILL EMBRACE IT.\nBRIAN FALLON SAYING WE WERE ALWAYS CONFIDENT NOTHING WOULD\nCAUSE THE JULY DECISION TO BE REVISITED BE, NOW DIRECTOR COMEY\nHAS CONFIRMED IT. I THINK WHAT IS MOST REMARKABLE\nFOR JAMES COMEY OF COURSE IS THAT HIS CREDIBILITY HAD ALREADY\nBEEN UNDER FIRE IN JULY WHEN HE WALKED THE TO UP LINE SAYING THE\nLAWS WERE BROKEN AND THEN DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.\nAND THEN HE INSERTED HIMSELF INTO THE ELECTION AT SUCH A LATE\nDATE AND THEN THE PRESIDENT OBAMA SAYING THERE WASN'T\nANYTHING THERE AND A LOT OF EYEBROWS RAISED THERE.\nBUT NOW HERE WE ARE TWO DAYS FROM THE ELECTION WHERE WE\nDIDN'T EXPECT TO HEAR FROM JAMES COMEY AT ALL SAYING SOMETHING\nTHAT THE CLINTON CAMP CERTAINLY THINKS IS A SIGH OF RELIEF.\n>> WHAT IS ODD IS HOW DO WE GO FORWARD.\nCOULD YOU ARGUE THAT COMEY WAS LOCKED INTO IT EVER SINCE JULY\n5th WHERE HE SAID HE WOULDN'T PURSUE ANYTHING CRIMINAL OR\nRECOMMEND THAT. KIND OF LOCKED IN THEN TO SAY IF\nTHERE WERE FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS, I'LL LET YOU KNOW.\nTHERE WERE FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS.  UPDATE IF ANY NEWS HAD COME OF\nTHAT. SO HE KEPT LOCKING HIMSELF IN\nTHESE POSITIONS WHERE COMEY WOULD HE SAID UP BEING THE END\nOF ELECTION YEAR SURPRISE AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN.\n>> AND ALSO THIS DOES NOT CHANGF ELECTION YEAR SURPRISE AGAIN AND\nAGAIN AND AGAIN. >> AND ALSO THIS DOES NOT CHANGE\nTHE FACT THAT THE FBI ON A SEPARATE BUT REPRESENTED TRACK\nHAS BEEN LOOKING CLOSELY AT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nSO THAT IS STILL OPEN. HOWEVER HAVE THIS COMING TWO\nDAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION, I WOULD HOPE NOW WITH TWO DAYS\nLEFT JAMES COMEY WOULD NOT WEIGH THIS AGAIN.\nSO THIS MAY BE THE FINAL WORD AT LEAST FROM THE FBI.\nBUT IF HILLARY CLINTON IS ELECTED PRESIDENT, LET'S SEE\nWHAT THE FBI COMES UP WITH AFTER THE ELECTION AND JAMES COMEY\nWILL BE IN A VERY AWKWARD POSITION IF THERE IS A PRESIDENT\nELECT CLINTON. ON THE OTHER HAPPENED, IF THERE\nIS A PRESIDENT ELECT TRUMP, THERE WILL BE AN INTERESTING\nMEET BUILDING THE WAY FORWARD WITH THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\n>> SO TO BE CLEAR ON THAT, THE FBI DIRECTOR COULD BE TERMINATED\nAT ANYTIME BY THE PRESIDENT. >> AND IF HILLARY CLINTON WERE\nTO TRY TO FIRE -- AS YOU SAY, TO FOLLOW OUT YOUR LINE OF THINKING\nTHERE, WERE TO BE ELECTED AND THEN TRY TO FIRE JAMES COMEY,\nTHAT COULD LEAD TO AN EVEN BIGGER CRISIS.\nBUT JAMES COMEY ALSO IS IN WHAT MIGHT BE AN UNTENABLE POSITION\nWITH THE BACK AND FORTH. BUT, YES, THE POINT OF THE FBI\nDIRECTOR'S TEN YEAR TERM IS FOR HIM, HE OR SHE, TO NOT BE\nINVOLVED IN POLITICS AT ALL BUT QUITE THE OPPOSITE HAS HAPPENED.\n>> ED, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. REMEMBER THAT EXPANDED E-MAIL\nPROBE NINE DAYS AGO, MANY WILL ARGUE TIGHTENED THE POLLS\nCONSIDERABLY, WELL, FORGET ABOUT THAT.\nTHE FBI DIRECTOR WHO REALLY TRIGGERED THAT OCTOBER SURPRISE\nTRIGGERS ANOTHER SURPRISE IN THE OTHER DIRECTION.\nJAMES COMEY ESSENTIALLY SAYING THAT WHAT THEY HAVE GOTTEN OFF\nOF THAT SERVER DOES NOT LEAD THEM TO BELIEVE THAT A FURTHER\nINVESTIGATION IS NECESSARY DOES NOTHING TO CHANGE THE AGENCY'S\nINITIAL COP CLUPGS FROM THIS SUMMER.\nIF YOU'RE COP FUSED, YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE.\nNOW TO THE FALLOUT FROM ALL OF THIS WITH ED ROLLINS AND PATH\nCAME DELL OIG. SO\n[ PAT CADDELL OIG. SO YOU COULD ARRESTED THAT\nHILLARY CLINTON WAS SUFFERING FROM THE POLLS I THINK WITH\nREVELATIONS FROM SKYROCKETING PREMIUMS FOR THE AFFORDABLE CARE\nACT. THIS PROBABLY HELPED DONALD\nTRUMP. THIS IS OUT OF THE EQUATION NOW.\nWILL IT DO ANYTHING IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS?\n>> I THINK IT LEADS TO THE PREMISE THAT WASHINGTON IS\nCORRUPT AND THAT I'M NOT ACCUSING THE DIRECTOR OF BEING\nCORRUPT, I'M BASK BASICALLY ACCUSING DIRECTOR OF SMASH\nPOSITION THE STATUE OF JUSTICE. HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT IS IN THOSE\n650,000 E-MAILS. THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN\nANYTHING THAT ANTHONY WEINER HAD IN HIS POSSESSION.\nSO IF YOU'RE SAYING THERE ARE 650,000 E-MAILS IN THERE AND\nTHAT IS NOT A CLASSIFIED DOCUMENT IN THERE, I THINK THAT\nIS ABSURD. AND EQUALLY IMPORTANT GIVING IT\nTO CONGRESS ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON WITHOUT ANY FEEDBACK,\nNO PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT, I THINK BASICALLY IS GOING TO BE VIEWED\nBY MANY AS A COVERUP AND VIEWED BY MANY AS THIS IS WHAT IS WRONG\nWITH WASHINGTON. LET'S CLEAN IT UP.\nAND I THINK THAT WORKS TO TRUMP'S ADVANTAGE.\n>> AND IT'S INTERESTING AND NOT TOO SURPRISING THAT NOW\nREPUBLICANS ARE JUST EXASPERATED AS COMEY.\nSO IT IS THAT RARE TIME WHEN BOTH SIDES ARE DISLIKING HIM\nNOW. A LOT OF DEMOCRATS ANGRY AT HIM\nFOR HAVING BROUGHT THEM TO THIS POINT.\nBUT BE IT THAT AS IT MAY, WILL THIS MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE IN\nVOTERS' MINDS THAT IS AMONG THOSE WHO HAVE NOT ALREADY\nVOTED, CLOSE TO 40 MILLION ALREADY HAVE, WILL IT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF\nDAYS? >> WHO KNOWS.\nI DON'T THINK SO THAT MUCH. BECAUSE I THINK THE BIG WHEELS\nARE IN MOTION. AS THEY WERE BEFORE THIS.\nTHERE WAS THAT NARRATIVE DEVELOPING.\nIF TRUMP WON, IT WAS COMEY. I THINK IT WAS ALREADY MOVING TO\nTHE BIGGER STAGE. BUT YOU HAVE THE PRESIDENT OF\nUNITED STATES WHO HAS TWICE BEFORE SAID HILLARY CLINTON WAS\nINNOCENT, BEFORE ANY INVESTIGATION WAS DONE THAT\nSHALL I HAD DONE NOTHING WRONG. AND THEN HE ATTACKS COMPANY ANY\nOWING THE OTHER DAY. YOU HAVE THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT\nWHICH CLEARLY IS SO MUCH WORSE, IT IS THE ERIC HOLDER, LORETTA\nLYNCH JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WHICH WE KNOW HAS BEEN TRYING TO\nTRAMPLE DOWN INVESTIGATIONS IN A WAY NOT EVERYONE THE MITCHELL\nJUSTICE DEPARTMENT DID. WE HAVE -- WHAT ED SAID ABOUT\nCORRUPTION, EVERYONE BELIEVED THIS.\nYOU KNOW THIS. I'D EVEN JUMP UP AND DOWN WHEN\nCOMEY CAME OUT BECAUSE I SAID THE WHOLE FBI WAS A MESS.\nTHIS WHOLE THING HAS BEEN A MESS.\nI BELIEVE THAT HE WAS UNDER INTOLERABLE PRESSURE FROM THE\nJUSTICE DEPARTMENT, THE PRESIDENT AND BROKE.\nTHERE IS NO WAY THAT YOU COULD GO THROUGH 650,000 E-MAILS AND\nKNOW WHAT WAS THERE. >> WE SHOULD JUST SAY AS WE JUST\nUPDATED FALLON WITH THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN WAS SAYING THAT WE WERE\nALWAYS CONFIDENT NOTHING WOULD CHANGE THE DECISION.\nNOW DIRECTOR COMEY HAS CONFIRMED THAT.\nAND ALONG KELLY AN CONWAY SAYING WHY DID YOU ATTACK COMEY AND HIS\nCREDIBILITY PMT WILL THIS RESONATE AMONG VOTER?\n>> I THINK PEOPLE WHO RAILROAD  HILLARY ARE VERY MUCH THERE.\nSO THE SAME DAY THAT YOU DISCOVER THE MAID IN MRS.\nCLINTON'S HOUSEHOLD WAS COPYING CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENTS, YOU SAME\nDAY THAT THE FOUNDATION WAS PAYING FOR CHELSEA'S WEDDING,\nEMPLOYING HER ARE AND FOR THE FBI DIRECTOR TO SAY GUESS WHAT,\nWE'VE QUICKLY LOOK AT ALL 650,000 AND THE DECISION THAT I\nMADE BEFORE WHICH THERE WAS A LOT THAT SHE DIDN'T DO OR SHOULD\nHAVE DONE BUT I DON'T FIND ANYTHING THAT CHANGES MY\nOPINION, I THINK THIS SO ABSURD AND A MAN I HAD A LOT OF RESPECT\nFOR, MR. COMEY, I HAVE MUCH LESS RESPECT.\nI THINK PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT THE MESS THAT IS THERE WILL STAY\nWITH TRUMP. >> I WANT TO SAY ONE THING HERE.\nLOOK, THIS ANSWER TO ALL OF THIS, AND I SAID THIS THE OTHER\nDAY, IS THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A SPECIAL INDEPENDENT COUNCIL WHO\nIS OUTSIDE OF WASHINGTON WHO IS NONPOLITICAL, TO TAKE OVER THIS\nENTIRE INVESTIGATION. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT CAN'T BE\nTRUSTED. THE FBI IS IN CHAOS AND WE NEED\nA LEGITIMATE INVESTIGATION. AND I GUESS IT'S OKAY THAT THE\nMAID WAS XEROXING AND FAXING CONFIDENTIAL AND OFTEN\nCLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS. BUT YOU KNOW --\n>> WE DON'T KNOW THAT TO BE FAIR.\nI JUST WANT TO CYCLE THIS VERY QUICKLY.\nDO YOU THINK NOW THAT WHATEVER SURGE DONALD TRUMP WAS HAVING\nSLOWS OR STOPS, WHATEVER DROP CLINTON WAS HAVING SLOWS OR\nSTOPS? BECAUSE EVEN PRIOR TO TODAY,\nBOTH OF THEIR POSITIONS SEEMED TO BE CEMENTING IN KEY STATES.\n>> NO, IN ONE SENSE AS I TRACK THIS AGAINST 1980, I WENT\nTHROUGH ALL OF THE TRACKING POLLS.\nMOST OF THEM IN THE LATEST POLLS, TRACKING POLLS SHOW HIM\nCLOSING OR DOING BETTER. >> SO YOU DON'T SEE ANYTHING\nCHANGING. ED ROLLINS, DO YOU SEE ANYTHING\nCHANGING? >> NO, ABSOLUTE NOT.\nTHOSE WHONK THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN WILL STILL THINK IT'S BROKEN.\n>> ALL RIGHT. THE CANDIDATES VERY BUSY IN THE\nNEXT 48 HOURS. THEY WILL BE IN A HALF OF A\nDOZEN OF THE BATTLEGROUND STATES.\nDONALD TRUMP LARGELY IGNORING THESE COACH. DEVELOPMENTS.\nWE ARE TOLD HILLARY CLINTON WILL, AS WELL.\nBUT AGAIN IT'S OUT THERE.WE ARE WILL, AS WELL.\nBUT AGAIN IT'S OUT THERE.

TIM KAINE AND I HAVE WRITTEN A\nBOOK CALLED \"STRONGER TO TOGETHER,\" IT TELLS YOU\nEVERYTHING WE WANT TO TRY TO DO AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU, IT IS\nIMPORTANT, YOU KNOW WHAT WE WANT TO DO, IT SHOULDN'T JUST BE AN\nELECTION ABOUT WORDS BUT IT SHOULD BE ABOUT PLANS AND\nPOLICIES SO YOU CAN SAY, WHAT WILL HELP ME?\nWITH COLLEGE CAN YOU GO TO MY WEBSITE.\n>> HILLARY CLINTON HAS YET TO MENTION THE DEVELOPMENTS TODAY\nWHERE THE FBI DIRECTOR DECIDED THAT THE INFORMATION THEY HAVE\nSO FAR DOES NOT WARRANT A REOPENING OF THE E-MAIL\nINVESTIGATION THAT WAS ALL THE RAGE NINE DAYS AGO WHEN HE SAID\nTHERE WOULD NOT BE ENOUGH TIME TO DO THIS.\nCERTAINLY IT IS AN INDICATION BEFORE THE ELECTION BUT IT HAS\nCHANGED. WE HAVE FORMER FBI ASSISTANT\nDIRECTOR, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE\nDEVELOPMENTS TODAY? >> I THINK THAT THE DIRECTOR AND\nTHE FBI WERE UNDER SUBSTANTIAL PRESSURE TO MOVE WITH ANYBODY\nSPEED TO SORT OUT THE E-MAILS, THE NEW E-MAILS THEY TOOK FROM\nMR. WEINER AND MISS ABERDEEN, AND TRY TO MAKE SENSE OF IT.\nTHE DIRECTOR'S NOTIFICATION TO CONGRESS OBVIOUSLY LIT OFF A\nFIRESTORM OF COMMENTARY IN BOTH SIDES.\nTHEY FELT PRESSURE. THEY WERE BOUND TO TRY TO GET\nTHROUGH IT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO SEE --.\n>> BUT THAT IS A LOT STUFF TO GET LAW IN NINE DAYS, THOUSANDS\nOF THEM. SO DO YOU THINK WHEN HE CAME UP\nTO SAY, LOOK, THERE IS NOTHING HERE THAT WOULD PROMPT US TO\nCHANGE WHAT WE DID BACK IN JULY...YOU KNOW THIS PROCESS AND\nHOW LONG IT TAKES BETTER THAN ANYBODY.\nIS THAT ABOUT RIGHTS NINE DAYS? >> THANK GOOD FOR AUTOMATION,\nTHE FBI HAS CREATED OR BUILT SOME SOFTWARE THAT WOULD ALLOW\nTHEM TO GET THROUGH THE VOLUME WITH THIS SORT OF SPEED AND WITH\nAN ACCURACY THAT ALLOWED THE DIRECTOR TO MAKE THIS\nNOTIFICATION TODAY. I DON'T THINK THEY WERE HAND\nSEARCHING AND PILE \"A\" TO PILE \"B\" WITH INDIVIDUAL AGENTS AND\nOTHERWISE SAYING HAVE YOU SEEN THIS BEFORE?\n>> OKAY, BUT DO YOU THINK THAT THE DIRECTOR PUT HIMSELF IN THE\nCORNER, THAT HE HAD TO DO WHAT HE DID BECAUSE HE SAID I WILL\nGIVE YOU THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS AND A WE ARE DOING AND HE DID\nAND OF COURSE, NINE DAYS AGO, NOW, WE GOT A COMMENT FROM NANCY\nPELOSI SAYING THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\nLEADERSHIP SAYING THE LATEST FBI FINDINGS SHOULD FINALLY CLOSE\nTHE DOOR ON THIS REPUBLICAN SIDE SHOW.\nWHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT? >> PELOSI IS GOING TO BLOW HOT\nPOLITICAL WINDS ACROSS THIS BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS AND THE\nREPUBLICANS ARE BOTH ALL ABOUT GETTING THEIR CANDIDATE ELECTED.\nMY SENSE IS THE VIEWER, THE LISTENER, HAS TO FLIP THAT TO\nTHE SIDE AND WRITE IT OFF TO SHEAR POLITICS.\nTHE DIRECTOR DID PUT HIMSELF IN A TIGHT PLACE.\nTHE TIMING OF THIS IS UNFORTUNATE.\nIT HAS BEEN UNFORTUNATE SINCE THE GOING.\nAS I HAVE SAID TO AND YOU TO OTHERS, HILLARY CLINTON\nPOSTPONES EVERY PIECE OF TIME. IF WE KNEW ABOUT THIS WHEN WE\nSHOULD HAVE KNOWN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BOB MULLER'S PROBLEM FIVE\nYEARS AGO. >> SHE GOT THE SERVER, SHE DID\nTHIS, SHE IS THE ONE WHO CREATE ED THIS THEATER THAT\nECHOES WHAT THE RNC CHAIRMAN SAID THAT HE BELIEVES HILLARY\nCLINTON \"BROKE THE LAW,\" AND I AM QUOTEING DESPITE THE FBI\nCLEARING HER. ARE YOU OF THAT OPINION?\n>> ON THE FACE OF IT, I UNDERSTAND THE DIRECTOR AND\nOTHERS HAD CONCERNS ABOUT THE PRECEDENT SO ON THE FACE OF IT\nIF YOU LOOK AT THIS ESPIONAGE STATUE, ABSOLUTELY WHAT SHE AND\nHER INNER CIRCLE DID, ABSOLUTELY.\n>> WHERE DO WE GO NOW? WHOEVER IS ELECTED WILL BE\nDEALING WITH COMEY. IT WILL BE TENSE FOR EITHER\nCANDIDATE. THE FBI DIRECTOR SERVES AT THE\nDISCRETION OF THE PRESIDENT. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF, SAY, A\nPRESIDENT ELECT, HILLARY CLINTON, WOULD HAVE TO DO VERSUS\nA PRESIDENT LIKE DONALD TRUMP? >> IT IS PROBLEMATIC EITHER WAY.\nWE HAVE, SAY IT IS HILLARY GETTING ELECTED AND WE HAVE A\nCLINTON PRESIDENCY, THAT IS A PROBLEM BECAUSE FROM THE\nINFORMATION I AM HEARING, THE CLINTON FOUNDATION WILL GO\nFAILURE. IN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS\nBEEN HOLDING THE FBI BACK AS WE HAVE HEARD RECENTLY, ON\nWEDNESDAY IT OUGHT TO BE FULL THROTTLE GOING FORWARD TO\nUNDERSTAND WHAT LAWS MAY HAVE BEEN BROKEN IN THE FOUNDATION\nINVESTIGATION UNRESTRICTED BECAUSE THE ELECTION IS THEN\nBEHIND US. IF IT IS A TRUMP PRESIDENCY,\nSAME THING, THE FBI NEEDS TO LOT EL FORWARD AND FIND OUT THE\nTRUTH. >> THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME\n, FROM THE VERY CONFUSED FILE, REMEMBER ALL THE CHIEFS\nAND INDIANS ARE ON THE SAME PAGE.\nSO MUCH MORE GOING ON AND CONTINUING COVERAGE ON FOX\nTHROUGH THE EVENING. WE WILL PURSUE THIS WITH OUR\nEXCLUSIVE GIFTS FROM FOX BUSINESS.\nIT IS AGREED THAT, TO PUT IT MILDLY IT IS \"CONFUSING.\"\nTHAT WILL DO IT FOR TONIGHT. >> WELCOME TO PERINO AND DESIRE\nWALL STREET.

TRUMP HAS THE LAST MINUTE\nMOMENTUM. TODAY HE IS GOING FROM GOING TO\nEND, SEVEN DIFFERENT DEMOCRATIC STATES THAT VOTED FOR OBAMA IN\n2012 AND HE WILL CAMPAIGN. TODAY WITH THE FBI DIRECTOR\nJAMES COMEY SENDING ANOTHER LETTER TO CONGRESS SAYING THAT\nTHEY HAVE LOOKED AT THE E-MAILS THAT WERE ON HUMA, HILLARY\nCLINTON'S SENIOR AIDE AND THEY FOUND MOSTLY DUPLICATES, NOTHING\nNEW CLASSIFIED THEY HAD ALREADY EASTBOUND AND KISSED IT OFF AND\nSAID THEY ARE DONE WITH THEIR INVESTIGATION AND DON'T HAVE\nANYTHING ELSE TO REPORT TO CONGRESS.\nTHAT IS NOT THE KIND OF NEWS THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WAS LACKING\nLOOKING TO HEAR. AN OCTOBER SURPRISE IN NOVEMBER.\nWE DO NOT HAVE REACTION FROM DONALD TRUMP, HE WAS ON STAGE\nWHEN THE LETTER CAME OUT. HE DID NOT GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO\nREAD AND COMMENT ON IT. BUT HIS CAMPAIGN MANAGER HAS\nBEGUN TO REACT. SHE TWEETED A LITTLE WHILE AGO,\nIN FBI CONCLUSIONS REMAIN UNCHANGED, THAT MEANS SHE STILL\nWAS WRECK MISAND CARELESS AND LIED ABOUT CLASSIFIED MATERIAL.\n>> THIS IS AN INTERESTING POSITION FOR THE REPUBLICAN\nCAMPAIGN HAVING PRAISED COMEY FOR SAYING THAT THE CASE WAS\nSTILL ONGOING AND FORGIVEN HIM FOR WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS THE\nRIGGED CORRUPTION OF NOT INDICTING HER IN THE FIRST\nPLACE, NOW HAVING PRAISED HIM FOR MADE THE SECOND MOVE,\nPRESUMABLY THERE WOULD BE CRITICISM COMING.\nIT IS NOT WHAT TRUMP WANTS FOR GET DIED DOWN TO.\nCHRIS AND DAY THAT, HE -- DANA HE IS SAYING SHE IS PART OF THE\nSYSTEM AND IT IS RIGGED, AND RATTLED OFF SERIES OF POLICY\nPROPOSALS MATCHING THOSE HITS ON HILLARY WITH WHAT HE SAID HE\nWILL DO FOR THE VOTERS. HE HAS THAT BIG MOMENT THE\nCANDIDATES WANT, GOING TO DEMOCRAT STATES AND PICKING OFF\nA COUPLE OF LOOSE STATES BUT NOT A LOT OF TIME.\n>> NOW TO CLEVELAND. JENNIFER?\n>> DANA, WHAT A DIFFERENCE A COUPLE OF HOURS MAKE THE WE WERE\nON FLIGHT WITH HILLARY CLINTON WHEN HER AIDE FOUND OUT ABOUT\nDIRECTOR COMEY'S STATEMENT AND WE GOT THE TWEETS IN REAL TIME,\nAND WE WERE THE ONES WHO ALERTED HER MEN TO LOOK AT PHONE.\nHILLARY CLINTON DID NOT ADDRESS THE ISSUE HERE IN CLEVELAND.\nSHE WAS GOING ON STAGE AND IT WAS A LAST MINUTE APPEAL TO TRY\nAND GET MORE AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS OUT HERE AND IN OHIO WE\nDO NOT ANTICIPATE SHE WILL SPEAK ABOUT THE FBI DIRECTOR'S\nPRONOUNCEMENT TODAY. FROM TALKING TO AIDES THEY FEEL\nVERY GOOD, AND HER COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR CAME\nBACK TO THE BACK OF THE PLANE AND TALKED TO US BEFORE WE\nLANDED AND SAID... [ INAUDIBLE ]\nTHEY HAVE COME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION AND REPEATD WHAT THEY\nSAID IN THE PAST, THEY BELIEVE THE INVESTIGATION INTO HILLARY\nCLINTON'S E-MAILS BY THE FBI IS CLOSED.\nTHEY ARE NOW FOCUSING ON HILLARY CLINTON'S CLOSING ARGUMENTS AND\nSHE WILL HEAD FROM OHIO TO NEW HAMPSHIRE WHERE SHE WILL BE ON\nSTAGE AND JOINED BY THE GOLD STAR FATHER THE MUSLIM\nAMERICAN'S SON WHO WAS KILLED IN IRAQ.\nTHAT IS WHAT THEY WANT IN THE FINAL DAYS ESPECIALLY IN\nMICHIGAN, A LARGE MUSLIM AMERICAN COMMUNITY, AND BACK TO\nTHE CLOSING ART IT HAS BEEN INCLUSIVE SOCIETY AND THEY WILL\nBE ON THE STAGE. >> THANK YOU, SO WHERE DOES IT\nSTAND? WE WILL BRING IN THE HUMAN\nBEINGS WHO KNOW ABOUT THIS. TUCKER CARLSON HE KNOWS AND\nTHREE SHOULD BE THE ANCHOR OF A BRAND NEW 7:00 P.M. SHOW RIGHT\nHERE EVERY WEEKNIGHT.

BASED ON OUR REVIEW WE HAVE NOT\nCHANGED OUR CONCLUSION THAT WE EXPRESSED IN JULY, WITH RESPECT\nTO HILLARY CLINTON, AND DUCKER SAID THERE WAS IN CRIMINAL\nINTENT, THEY DON'T SEE ANYTHING AND WE HAD THE VERY USUAL\nCIRCUMSTANCE OF THE FBI DIRECTOR SAYING IN JULY, NO PROSECUTION\nWANT WAR RAN -- WARRANTED AGAIN IN OCTOBER SAYING WE.\nLOOK AGAIN AND THEN TWO DAYS BEST ELECTION, NEVER MIND.\n>> AND NOT MENTIONING THE APOLOGY TO THE AGENT THAT\nHANDLED ANTHONY WEINER'S LAPTOP. >> SOME THINGS ARE UNCLEAR, THE\nPRESS CONFERENCE IS OVER. IN THE INVESTIGATION OF CRIMINAL\nINVESTIGATION OF HILLARY CLINTON, IS IT OVER?\n>> IT DOES NOT SAY THAT. >> THE CAMPAIGN IS SAYING, AND\nIT IS REPEATED BY EVERYONE, BUT I DON'T THINK IT IS TRUE, BUT IT\nIS THE RELATIVE HAVEN'T QUESTION.\nI DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF THIS OR THE LETTER HE SENT A\nFRIDAY AGO, EITHER, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE MANAGE IS GOING ON, A\nNUMBER OF INVESTIGATIONS INTO HILLARY AND HER FAMILY'S\nFOUNDATION. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO RESPOND AND\nI DON'T KNOW IF ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON?\nIS GOING TO PENETRATE INTO THE MINES OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT\nVOTED. >> IS THIS A REEMERGING OF THE\nE-MAIL CONTROVERSY, JUST A FRIDAY AGO, WAS IT?\n>> NO ONE DAYS. >> WAS IT REFLECTED IN THEG?\n>> HERS LEADS TO OBAMACARE PREMIUMS, THE DRAMATIC HIKES AND\nTRUMP JUMP ON IT RIGHT AWAY AND THE MESSAGE ON IT FOR SEVERAL\nDAYS AND THE WikiLeaks STUFF WAS PILING UP AND BILL CLINTON\nSTUFF, JUST GREASY CLINTON WORLD, NO BOUNDARIES, DOUBLE\nDEALING STUFF COME OUT OF PODESTA E-MAILS FROM\nWikiLeaks STARTED TO ERODE THE LEAD BEFORE THE BOMBSHELL\nOCTOBER 28. I THINK THERE IS PROBABLY AN\nINVESTIGATION OF THE FOUNDATION AND THE THRESHOLD FOR\nPROSECUTION FOR CORRUPTION IS ACTUALLY LOWER THAN THE\nTHRESHOLD FOR PROSECUTION FOR MISUSE OF CLASSIFIED MEANING IT\nIS EASIER TO BUST THEM FOR DOUBLE DEALING WHILE SECRETARY\nOF STATE AND THE CLINTON FOUNDATION IS LIKELY THE\nINVESTIGATION. BUT TO SAY CORRUPT BEATS CRAZY.\nTHE NEW LINE IS SHE IS EXONERATED AND VOTERS WILL NOT\nSEPARATE THE FOUNDATION INVESTIGATION FROM THE E-MAIL\nAND THEY WILL THINK --. >> AND IT HAS BEEN FACTORED IN?\n>> AND BIG JULIE IN \"GUYS AND DOGS,\" AND THE GUY SAID \"MY\nRECORD IS PERFECT, 32 ARRESTS, NO CONVICTIONS.\"\nAND HILLARY CLINTON APPROACH IS, I'VE BEEN CLEARED AGAIN.\nI'M CLEARED AGAIN. I WONDER, DOES THIS ACTUALLY\nBREAK THROUGH AND GIVE HER SOMETHING TO WORK WITH?\n>> WITH 50 HOURS YOU CANNOT BAY, RESPOND ENOUGH MONEY ON TV ADS\nBUT NOW THEY HAVE THE NEWS.

WHAT WE CARE ABOUT IS THE TREND.\nTHE \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" POLL SMELLS VAGUELY OF CINNAMON.\nYOU WILL ENJOY THAT. >> ARE YOU HUNGRY?\n>> I'M ALWAYS HUNGRY.

I THINK HE WAS TRYING TO PROTECT\nHIMSELF AND THE INSTITUTION, BUT THE FACT A THAT HE DID LOOK AT\nALL THESE AND WE ARE NOW TELLING PEOPLE THEY FOUND NOTHING NEW IS\nVERY SIGNIFICANT AND VERY IMPORTANT.\nONE OF THE THINGS I'M THE MOST CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE DAY AFTER\nTHIS ELECTION, WE'VE GOT TO COME TOGETHER.\nWE ARE A COUNTRY THAT'S BEEN DIVIDED.\nI DON'T LIKE IT.

WE ALL NEED TO GO OUT AND VOTE.\nWE'VE ALL GOT TO MAKE SURE WE UNDERSTAND OUR FUTURES AT STAKE\nON ELECTION DAY. >> AND WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE\nTO ADD TO THIS BREAKING STORY. BRIAN FALLEN, COMMUNICATIONS\nDIRECTOR FOR THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS JUST PUT OUT A\nTWEET. WE WANT TO PUT IT UP ON AIR.\nI'M GOING TO READ IT. TWEETING, WE WERE ALWAYS\nCONFIDENT NOTHING WOULD CAUSE THE JULY DECISION TO BE\nREVISITED. NOW DIRECTOR COMEY HAS CONFIRMED\nIT. DID YOU KNOW THIS WILL BE THE\nOUTCOME. DID YOU THINK THEY COULD RESOLVE\nIT. I PRAYED THEY WOULD RESOLVE IT.\nI THINK THE FBI HAD MORE OF A RESPONSIBILITY TO DO IT.\nALL OF THE FALSE THINGS THAT STARTED COMING OUT.\nI'M GLAD TO SEE IT HAPPENED. I ACTUALLY TOOK SECRETARY\nCLINTON AT HER WORD. SHE SAID SHE MADE A MISTAKE.\nSHE SAID SHE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG.\nI'VE KNOWN WITH WOMAN FOR 30 YEARS.\nI'VE WORKED WITH HER ON SO MANY PROJECTS.\nI KNOW WHAT A GOOD DECEDENT HONORABLE PERSON SHE IS.\nI'M GLAD IT HAPPENED, BUT IT IS NOT GIVE LG ME ONE SENSE OF\nCOMFORT FOR 48 HOURS. WE HAVE TO BE ALL HANDS ON DECK\nWORKING HARD. >> CONGRESSWOMAN, I WANT TO ASK\nYOU TO STANDBY AS I BRING IN BEN GINZBERG WHO IS ONE OF OUR\nREPUBLICAN ANALYST. REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE\nTO BE HERE. LET ME JUST REMIND OUR VIEWERS,\nAT THIS VERY MOMENT, WE ARE GETTING A LETTER FROM DIRECTOR\nCOMEY HE SENT TO CONGRESS AND ESSENTIALLY SAYS THEY HAVE GONE\nTHROUGH NEWLY DISCOVERED E-MAILS AND BASED ON REVIEW HAVE NOT\nCHANGED CONCLUSIONS THAT WE EXPRESS INSTEAD JULY WITH\nRESPECT TO SECRETARY CLINTON. BEN KWHARKS IS THE POLITICAL\nSIGNIFICANCE OF THIS. AS I WAS JUST DISCUSSING WITH\nCONGRESSWOMAN, WE SAW THE POLLS START TO TIGHTEN IN THE NUMBER\nOF BATTLEGROUND STATES IN THE WAKE OF COMEY'S FIRST\nANNOUNCEMENT. COULD THIS BE A GAME CHANGER.\n>> NOT MUCH TIME LEFT IN THE GAME.\nIT WILL CHANGE THE DISCUSSION AND THE NARRATIVE IN THE LAST 48\nHOURS OF VOTING. I SUSPECT MOST VOTERS ARE LOCKED\nIN NOW. SO A SORT OF NONPROSECUTION\nSTATEMENT FROM THE FBI DIRECTOR MAY OR MAY NOT ACTUALLY BE A\nMOTIVATOR TO GET PEOPLE OUT TO VOTE.\nMAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT, IT WILL CHANGE WHAT BOTH DONALD\nTRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON AND THE CAMPAIGN SAY IN THE LAST 48\nHOURS. WHAT MORE DISCUSSION IN THE LAST\n48 HOURS ABOUT THE E-MAILS WILL DO IS BASICALLY TAKE THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN OFF OF ITS POSITIVE MESSAGE AND THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN\nIS GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE ITS MOTIVATIONAL MESSAGE.\nSO THIS DOES KIND OF SCRAMBLE WHAT THE CAMPAIGNS WILL BE\nSAYING. >> AND BEN, AS YOU AND I ARE\nHAVING THIS DISCUSSION, WE ARE WATCHING PRESIDENT OBAMA DEPART.\nHE IS GETTING READY FOR HIS BIG EVENT IN FLORIDA.\nHE'S ABOUT TO DEPART. HE HASN'T GOTTEN OFF YET.\nOF COURSE THIS WILL BE WELCOME NEWS TO PRESIDENT OBAMA AND TO\nALL OF SECRETARY CLINTON'S TOP SUROGATS.\nTHERE'S PRESIDENT OBAMA WEARING HIS SUNGLASSES ABOUT TO ADDRESS\nTHE FOLKS THERE IN THAT CRITICAL BATTLEGROUND STATE.\nBEN, I'VE BEEN TALKING TO MY COLLEAGUE SAYING FLORIDA GOING\nTO BE A LOT NAIL BITER. COULD THIS TYPE OF REVELATION\nTHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM DIRECTOR COMEY AND TO REMIND OUR VIEWERS,\nWE HAVE NOT CHANGED CONCLUSIONS THAT WE EXPRESS INSTEAD JULY\nWITH RESPECT TO SECRETARY CLINTON.\nHAVING REVIEWED ALL OF THESE E-MAILS.\nCOULD THIS MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN A STATE LIKE FLORIDA?\n>> IT CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN ANY STATE, I SUSPECT.\nI GET FLASH BACKS WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT FLORIDA.\nWHAT'S INTERESTING IS BOTH PARTIES HAVE BEEN DRIVING THEIR\nVOTERS TO THE POLLS IN THE LAST WEEK WHILE THE INVESTIGATION WAS\nSTILL PENDING. THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN WAS VERY\nMUCH TALKING ABOUT HOW MANY NEW PEOPLE IT HAD DRIVEN TO THE\nPOLLS WHILE THE CLOUD WAS SORT OF OVER THEM.\nWHAT YOU DON'T KNOW IS ALL THE VOTES THAT MANAGED TO GET BANKED\nIN THE LAST WEEK, HOW THEY'LL VOTE, HOW MOTIVATED THEY WERE TO\nVOTE FOR SECRETARY CLINTON. HOW MOTIVATED THEY WERE TO VOTE\nDOWN BALLOT FOR REPUBLICAN SENATE CANDIDATES.\nSO THIS WILL BE USED AS A MOTIVATIONAL SPEECH TO THOSE\nVOTERS WHO ARE STILL LEFT TO GO OUT AND VOTE ON ELECTION DAY.\n>> AND BEN, I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO STANDBY AS I BRING IN MY\nCOLLEAGUE ANDREA MITCHELL. YOU AND I HAVE BEEN TRACKING THE\nFAST MOVING DEVELOPMENTS WITH RESPECT TO DIRECTOR COMEY\nANNOUNCING HE IS LOOKING INTO NEWLY DISCOVERED E-MAILS WHICH\nMAY OR MAY NOT HAVE RELATED TO SECRETARY CLINTON'S STATE\nDEPARTMENT. WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO THE\nREVELATION THAT AT THIS HOUR, DIRECTOR COMEY SENDING A LETTER\nTO CONGRESS ESSENTIALLY SAYING THEY'VE REVIEWED ALL OF THE\nNEWLY DISCOVERED E-MAILS AND NOTHING HAS CHANGED.\n>> JUST TO SHARE WITH YOU THE SPOKESMAN FOR THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN TWEET SAYING WE WERE ALWAYS CONFIDENT NOTHING WOULD\nCAUSE THE JULY DECISION TO BE REVISITED.\nNOT COMEY HAS CONFIRMED IT. IT'S A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH.\nNO MATTER WHAT THE DAYS THAT THEY'VE LOST IN TRYING TO\nCONTINUE WITH ORIGINAL PLAN FOR A FIVE OR SIX OR SEVEN DAY\nUPLIFTING CLOSING MESSAGE NOW THEY CAN AS THEY HAD HOPED\nRESUME THE CLOSING MESSAGE. THE ADS THEY'VE DONE T FINAL\nCAMPAIGN SPRINT. A LOT OF DAMAGE HAS BEEN CAUSED.\nTHERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THEY'VE LOST THEIR LEAD HERE IN NEW\nHAMPSHIRE IN THE LAST WEEK SINCE THE FIRST FBI LETTER CAME OUT\nFROM COMEY. THEY HAVE LOST ADVANTAGE IF THEY\nEVER HAD ONE IN OHIO. THEY ARE SCRAMBLING TO DEFEND\nMICHIGAN. THEY'RE NECK IN NECK IN FLORIDA.\nNOW THEY CAN TRY TO REACH OUT TO THOSE INDEPENDENT SWING VOTERS,\nPARTICULARLY HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND MICHIGAN AND OTHER\nSTATES. THE AND TRY TO CLOSE THIS DOWN.\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN WITH A VERY UNUSUALLY DISCIPLINED APPEAL HAS\nBEEN GOING AFTER HER HAMMER AND TONGUE FOR THE PAST NINE DAYS\nSINCE THE FIRST COMEY LETTER CAME OUT.\nI DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS GOING TO REVIEW AND CAUSE ANOTHER SWING\nFROM TRUMP AND HIS ALLIES GOING BACK AT COMEY AFTER DECLARING\nHIM A HERO FOR THE LAST NINE DAYS.\nAT LEAST THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN CAN TRY TO DLOES IT DOWN.\nIT'S STILL HANGING OVER THEIR HEAD.\nDOUBTS HAVE BEEN RAISED. WE SEE IN OUR OWN POLL KWHAG THE\nWORD CLOUDS SHOW. THE DISTRUST FOR HILLARY CLINTON\nPROFOUND FOR SOMEONE WHO IS THIS CLOSE TO POTENTIALLY BECOMING\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. >> ANDREA, AS I DISCUSSED THIS\nWITH BEN, I ASKED IF THIS WAS A GAME CHANGER.\nHE RAISED THE VERY ACCURATE POINT THERE'S NOT THAT MUCH TIME\nLEFT IN THE GAME. YOU HAVE COVERED A NUMBER OF\nPRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS. WHAT IS THE REALTIME IMPACT OF\nSOMETHING LIKE THIS BREAKING JUST 48 HOURS BEFORE ELECTION\nDAY? I GUESS THE QUESTION IS, IN SOME\nOF THESE STATEDS, COULD IT MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE OR DO YOU\nTHINK THE CAKE IS BAKED. >> THE CAKE MAY WELL BE BAKED.\nTHE 11 DAYS OUT THAT LETTER FROM COMEY HAD A REALLY BIG\nINFLUENCE. FIRST OF ALL, MOST OF THE\nPOLLING PLACES, EARLY POLLING PLACES IN NORTH CAROLINA HAD\nONLY JUST OPENED ON THURSDAY AND HIS LETTER CAME OUT ON FRIDAY.\nYOU'VE HAD A WHOLE WEEK OF DAMAGE DONE TO THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN IN A NUMBER OF STATES THAT HAVE EARLY VOTING.\nWHETHER OR NOT THIS NEWS CAN CATCH UP TO THOSE STATES THAT\nARE STILL DOING TUESDAY VOTING AND TO THOSE WHO HAVE NOT YET\nVOTED WHO ARE PLANNING TO VOTE ON MONDAY REMAINS TO BE SEEN,\nBUT THIS IS AWFULLY LATE IN THE GAME FOR THE NEWS -- FOR THE\nGOOD NEWS TO CATCH UP WITH THE BAD NEWS THAT PROCEEDED IT 11\nDAYS OUT. >> AND WE ARE LOOKING AT DONALD\nTRUMP'S PLANE IN MINNESOTA. HE IS ABOUT TO DISEMBARK.\nWE ARE GOING TO KEEP THAT LIVE PICTURE UP.\nAS WE DO, I WANT TO BRING BEN GINSBURG BACK IN.\nBEN, TALK ABOUT IF YOU WOULD THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION\nABOUT DIRECTOR COMEY. AND THE ROLE THAT HE HAS NOW\nPLAYED IN THIS ELECTION CYCLE. THE FACT HE NOW HAS THIS SORT OF\nTERRORNY RELATIONSHIP WITH DONALD TRUMP AND SECRETARY\nCLINTON. HE WAS EVEN QUOTED AS SAYING\nMIGHT BE AWKWARD WHEN THERE IS A NEW PRESIDENT NO MATTER WHO\nWINS. HOW DOES THIS IMPACT HIS ROLL\nWITH THE POTENTIAL NEXT PRESIDENT WHETHER IT'S TRUMP OR\nCLINTON. >> WELL, BY HIM DOING WHAT HE\nDID BOTH OPENING THE INVESTIGATION BECAUSE HE THOUGHT\nIT WAS IMPORTANT TO DO THAT AND TO TELL PEOPLE ABT IT, AND HIM\nHAVING RESOLVED IT WITHIN 48 HOURS OF THE ELECTION, BUT\nBEFORE THE ELECTION HE BROUGHT THE FBI FRONT AND CENTER INTO\nTHIS CAMPAIGN IN A WAY THAT IT NEVER HAS BEEN BEFORE AND I\nSUSPECT THEY ARE NOT PARTICULARLY HAPPY ABOUT BEING\nPUT IN THE ROLE THAT DIRECTOR COMEY THOUGHT IT SHOULD BE.\nLET ME ALSO MAKE THE POINT WE CAN REST ASSURED BEHIND THE\nDOORS OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN RIGHT NOW, THERE'S SOME VERY\nFRENZIED ACTIVITY FIGURING OUT WHAT DONALD TRUMP SHOULD SAY\nWHEN HE COMES OUT. AND WE SHOULD ALSO NOT\nUNDERESTIMATE THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT HE SAYS AND WHAT HIS TONE\nIS AND HOW HE DEALS WITH HEART BREAKING NEWS THAT DOES CUT\nAGAINST THE NARRATIVE THAT HE'S BEEN -- THAT HE'S BEEN USING FOR\nTHE PAST FEW DAYS. THIS IS GOING TO BE A BIG MOMENT\nTO THE EXTENT THE CAKE IS NOT BAKED IN THE NEXT 48 HOURS.\n>> YOU RAISED SUCH AN IMPORTANT POINT BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP HAS\nBEEN SO ON MESSAGE, BEN. WE HAVE SEEN A VERY DIFFERENT\nDONALD TRUMP. THAT'S PART OF WHY HE'S CLOSING\nOUT THE RACE ON SUCH A STRONG NOTE.\nWHAT DO YOU ANTICIPATE HIS RESPONSE IS GOING TO BE WHEN HE\nTAKES THE PODIUM. >> WELL, I WISH I HAD THE\nABILITIES TO SPECULATE ON THAT. I MEAN, HE BASICALLY HAS TWO\nCHOICES. WHICH IS ONE TO GO HAMMER AND\nTONGUE AGAINST THE FIB REACHING THE CONCLUSION WHEN HE'LL SAY\nTHE EVIDENCE WAS SO OBVIOUS THIS CONCLUSION IS WRONG.\nTHE SECOND IS TO TRY AND TAKE A MORE STATE MAN LIKE APPROACH TO\nSAY THEY DID EVERYTHING THEY COULD.\nALL THIS HAS POINTED OUT THE WEAKNESSES WITH HILLARY CLINTON.\nEVEN IF SHE GOT A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH ON THIS, SHE'S STILL NOT\nTRUSTWORTHY AND HONEST. IN OTHER WORDS, REINFORCING WHAT\nPEOPLE SAY IN THE POLLS, BUT HIM TRYING TO TAKE A MORE STATESMAN\nLIKE AND NOT BAM BOSTONIC APPROACH HERE IN THE LAST 48\nHOURS. THAT IN A SENSE CAN BE AN\nADNTAGE FOR HIM. >> PRESIDENT OBAMA TAKING A\nPODIUM IN FLORIDA. WE WILL WATCH AND MONITOR TO SEE\nIF HE RAISES THIS ISSUE AT ALL. CONGRESSWOMAN, I WANT TO GO BACK\nTO YOU. BEN TALKS ABOUT THE FACT THAT\nTHERE ARE LIKELY DISCUSSIONS GOING ON RIGHT NOW WITHIN THE\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN ABOUT HOW EXACTLY HE SHOULD RESPOND.\nHOW DO YOU ANTICIPATE SECRETARY CLINTON WILL RESPOND WHEN WE\nHEAR FROM HER LATER TODAY. >> WELL, EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN\nSAID SO FAR BY THE WAY. I THINK THAT SHE WILL BE\nRELIEVED, BUT HAVE KNOWN ALL ALONG THAT SHE HAD BEEN TELLING\nTHE TRUTH AND GLAD TO HAVE HER NAME CLEARED AGAIN, AND, AGAIN.\nWHY THIS HAS TO KEEP HAPPENING, I DON'T KNOW.\nI THINK BEN IS ABSOLUTELY -- IS WHAT SOME OF US PREDICTED HE MAY\nBE WHICH IS EMOTIONAL. NOT PRESIDENTIAL OR STATESMAN\nLIKE. I THINK THESE NEXT FEW HOURS ARE\nAS IMPORTANT FOR DONALD TRUMP AS THEY ARE FOR ANYBODY.\n>> WE'RE JUST HEARING FROM JENNIFER WHO IS OF COURSE THE\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR.\nSHE IS HOLDING A GAGGLE ON THE CAMPAIGN PLANE.\nLET ME JUST READ A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT SHE IS TELLING REPORTERS AT\nTHIS HOUR. SHE HAS SAID GLAD TO SEE\nDIRECTOR COMEY AFFIRMED THE CONCLUSION THAT HE REACHED IN\nJULY AND THAT THE MATTER IS RESOLVED.\nTHAT MIGHT BE A PREVIEW OF WHAT WE HEAR FROM SECRETARY CLINTON\nWHEN IN FACT WE DO HEAR FROM HER TODAY.\nTHE CAMPAIGN CLEARLY BREATHING A SIGH OF RELIEF ABOUT THIS.\nAND CONGRESSWOMAN, I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SURPRISED THAT IT\nWAS RESOLVED SO QUICKLY BECAUSE THERE WAS A SENSE AT LEAST WE\nHAD SHADE THIS IS GOING TO TAKE QUITE SOME TIME.\nMIGHT NOT BE RESOLVED BY THE TIME ELECTION DAY COMES AROUND.\nTALK ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE AND THE PRESSURE THAT THE FIB WAS\nUNDER TO GET TO THIS CONCLUSION BEFORE ELECTION DAY.\n>> FIB WAS UNDER ENORMOUS PRESSURE.\nQUITE FRANKLY THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO FEEL IT WAS JUST\nIRRESPONSIBLE FOR THE TIMING AND DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT.\nQUITE FRANKLY, I HEARD FROM MANY PEOPLE WITHIN THE FBI BUREAU\nTHAT COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY HAD BANNED POLITICAL WHEN\nTHEY HAD NEVER BEEN POLITICAL BEFORE.\nHE HAD A RESPONSIBILITY TO DO WHAT HE DID TODAY.\nHE CAST DISPERSION ON A CHARACTER WHICH WE'RE NOW\nLEARNING WAS UNFAIR. I'M GLAD IT HAS BEEN.\nWE'VE SEEN THE TRUTH AGAIN. WE'RE MOVING ON AND FOCUS ON THE\nNEXT 48 HOURS AND THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY WHICH IS THE\nCANDIDATE I'M SUPPORTING HAS TRIED TO DO THROUGH THE\nCAMPAIGN. I THINK WE HAVE AN IMPORTANT 48\nHOURS BEFORE US. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE LEFT\nTO VOTE. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY\nKNOWS THEIR VOTE MATTERS. >> CONGRESSWOMAN, I WANT TO ASK\nYOU THE TO STAY WITH US. BRING IN FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE,\nKATIE TUR. COVERING THE CAMPAIGN FROM THE\nVERY BEGINNING. REMIND VIEWERS OF THE BREAKING\nNEWS. DIRECTOR COMEY SENDING LETTER TO\nCONGRESS. THEY LOOKED THROUGH THE NEW\nE-MAILS. THE EQUATION HAS NOT CHANGED.\nBOTTOM LINE NOT MOVING FORWARD WITH ANY ACTION AGAINST\nSECRETARY CLINT. ARE YOU HEARING FROM THE\nCAMPAIGN YET. >> I'VE MADE MULTIPLE CALLS TO\nTHE CAMPAIGN. SO FAR ALL THE CALLS ARE GOING\nPRETTY QUICKLY TO VOICE MAIL. HEARING RIGHT NOW IS THE\nCAMPAIGN SCRAMBLING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO RESPOND TO THAT AS\nBEN GINSBURG JUST NOTED. I WOULD WATCH THIS PLANE DOOR.\nWE SEE TRUMP LANDED. WATCH THIS DOOR TO SEE HOW LONG\nIT TAKES HIM TO EMERGE AND TO TAKE THE STAGE.\nWE DO KNOW FROM SOME PRETTY GREAT REPORTING FROM THE \"NEW\nYORK TIMES\" TODAY WHEN THIS FBI REVIVAL OF THE INVESTIGATION\nBROKE A WEEK AND A HALF AGO NOW, NINE DAYS AGO, DONALD TRUMP'S\nTEAM WRESTLED OVER HOW HE SHOULD RESPOND TO IT FOR QUITE A WHILE\nINSIDE THEIR CAMPAIGN, INSIDE THEIR PLANE, EXCUSE ME.\nBEFORE HE TOOK THE STAGE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.\nTHAT WAS GOOD NEWS. THEY WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT\nHOW BEST TO CAPITALIZE ON THAT NEWS.\nIN IS NOT AS GOOD OF NEWS AS THAT WAS FOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.\nTHIS IS EVERYTHING THEY WERE HOPING WOULD NOT HAPPEN.\nTHEY HAVE BEEN TALKING ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\nABOUT HOW THIS WILL LIKELY LEAD TO AN INDICTMENT.\nTHAT HILLARY CLINTON HAD SOMETHING TO HIDE.\nDONALD TRUMP KEEPS MENTIONING OVER AND OVER.\n650,000 E-MAILS THAT WERE FOUND ON ANTHONY WEINER'S COMPUTER AND\nTHEY'RE PROBABLY CLASSIFIED. PROBABLY EVEN MORE CLASSIFIED\nTHAN CLASSIFIED HE SAID AT ONE POINT.\nEVEN MORE CONFIDENTIAL THAN CONFIDENTIAL.\nHE'S USED TERMS LIKE THAT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\nTHEY SAW THAT AS THAT I RECALL SMOKING GUN AND A WAY TO REALLY\nGAIN SOME GROUND GOING INTO TUESDAY AND I WOULD NOTE DONALD\nTRUMP HAS HAD NINE DAYS, NINE DAYS TO SIT HERE ON STAGE AND\nINSINUATE THERE COULD BE SOMETHING WRONG HERE.\nTHAT HILLARY CLINTON COULD HAVE OR MOST LIKELY IN HIS WORDS DID\nDO SOMETHING WRONG. THAT SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT\nTHINGS THAT SHE SHOULD NOT HAVE AND E-MAILS WITH HUMA.\nHE'S USED ANTHONY WEINER'S NAME ON THE TRAIL.\nSAYING HUMA ABEDIN WAS SHARING TOP SECRET INFORMATION WITH HER\nHOW HE'S CALLED HER PERVERT AND SLEAZE HUSBAND.\nTHAT IT WAS DANGEROUS. HE'S USED THIS TO HIS ADVANTAGE.\nGOP OPERATIVES SAY THIS WAS A REAL KEY POINT HE COULD MAKE TO\nGET REPUBLICANS TO COME HOME TO DONALD TRUMP.\nREMEMBER, HE WAS NOT ENJOYING AND HAS NOT BEEN ENJOYING\nACCORDING TO THE POLLS THE SAME REPUBLICAN SUPPORT THAT PAST\nREPUBLICAN NOMINEES HAVE HAD. PEOPLE LIKE MITT ROMNEY, JOHN\nMcCAIN. DONALD TRUMP WASN'T OVER THE 90%\nMARK IN TERMS OF GETTING EVERY REPUBLICAN THAT HE CAN OUT THERE\nTO VOTE FOR HIM. SO THIS ENABLED THEM TO MAKE THE\nRARMT THAT DO YOU JUST ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO VOTE FOR\nDONALD TRUMP BECAUSE THE VOTE FOR HILLARY CLINTON WOULD BE\nDANGEROUS. EARLIER AT A TRUMP RALLY IN\nSOURKS CITY IOWA. TRUMP SAID WE NEED A GOVERNMENT\nTHAT CAN GO TO WORK ON DAY ONE FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\nTHAT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE WITH HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHE PRIME SUSPECT IN A FAR REACHING CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION.\nWILL HE SAY THAT AGAIN AT THIS MINNESOTA RALLY?\nTHAT IS UNCLEAR. WHAT I CAN TELL YOU, IS THAT\nEVEN THOUGH DONALD TRUMP HAS TALKED ABOUT A LIKELY INDICTMENT\nCOMING BETWEEN CLINTON OR FOR CLINTON WITH INVOLVEMENT IN THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION, EVEN THOUGH HE TALKED ABOUT PRESIDENT OBAMA\nYELLING AT A PROTESTER. HE KEPT DOING THAT EVEN AFTER\nTHOSE REPORTS WERE RETRACTED. FOX NEWS RETRACTED REPORT\nTALKING ABOUT A LIKELY INDICTMENT BETWEEN THE CLINTON\nAND CLINTON FOUNDATION. FOX NEWS ALSO RETRACTED REPORT\nTHAT SAYS PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS YELLING AT A POERSS.", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1478468177592.1478465021976.2f9a464a-83b0-4091-b625-97228d089612.segment2.thumb.jpg", "channel": "356"}, {"start": 0, "length": 502822.0, "end": 502822, "date": 1478475828805, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1478479628944.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1478475826563-08f84f02-4708-40c4-9653-d839fcc57957-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=0.00,502.82", "text": "AND DRABS.\nTHE INVESTIGATION IS OVER, NO IT'S NOT, JUST KIDDING.\nNOT PRESSING CHARGES BUT LET ME GO TO CONGRESS TWO DAYS LATER\nAND TESTIFY ALL THE THINGS SHE DID WRONG THAT MIGHT LEAD A\nDIFFERENT PROSECUTOR TO PRESSING CHARGES.\nTHAT WAS THE FRUSTRATION AND, INDEED, THE CONSTERNATION FOR\nMANY PEOPLE INCLUDING DONALD TRUMP AND HIS CAMPAIGN IN THAT\nIF SHE JUST DID ALL THESE THINGS AND FOLKS HAVE DONE FAR LESS,\nGENERAL CARTWRIGHT, THE ASSOCIATE IN THE SUBMARINE DOING\nFAR LESS THEY EITHER HAVE OR MAY FACE JAIL TIME --\n>> KELLYANNE, I WANT TO STOP YOU.\nWHATEVER SIDE YOU'RE ON IT'S RATHER EXTRAORDINARY WHAT PLAYED\nOUT OVER THE LAST NINE DAYS.

IT DIDN'T CHANGE MY MIND THAT\nTHE INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN MISHANDLED FROM THE BEGINNING.\nWHY DID WE FIND OUT TODAY THE HOUSEKEEPER IS PRINTING OUT\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION?  WHY DID WE FIND OUT IN THE\nCOURSE OF THE INVESTIGATION THAT HILLARY CLINTON LIED ABOUT\nWHETHER SHE EXCHANGED CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.\nJAMES COMEY SAID SHE DID. WHY DID SHE USE ONE DEVICE WHEN\nTHEY WERE UP TO 13 OF THEM. WHY DID SHE LIE SHE DID\nEVERYTHING BY THE BOOK AND COLIN POWELL TOLD HER SO.\nNO, SHE DIDN'T.

SOME OF THE FACTS ARE STILL THE\nSAME. SHE WAS RECKLESS, CARELESS,\nSELFISH. THERE WAS NO REASON TO SET UP\nTHE SEBBER IN THE FIRST PLACE. NO REASON FOR US TO HAVE WASTED\nALL THESE RESOURCES OF OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO TRACK DOWN\nHER PETTY, PEEVISH SELFISH INTEREST, SETTING UP THE SERVER,\nLYING ABOUT IT.

WHAT THE ELECTORATE IS THINKING\nTUESDAY, I DON'T SEE A CHANGE IN A NEW AND DIFFERENT DIRECTION,\nNEW DIRECTION, 0% THESE NOT GOING TO CHANGE BECAUSE THE FBI\nDIRECTOR CAME BACK OUT. I THINK IT'S IRONIC THEY THREW\nAN ANVIL ON TOP OF JAMES COMEY'S HEAD THE MOMENT HE DID THIS,\nINCLUDING THE PRESIDENT, SAYING HE DOESN'T WANT HIM TO WORK ON\nINNUENDO IN THE ELECTION AND NOW HE'S A HERO.\n>> SPEAKING OF INNUENDO, DONALD TRUMP JUST TODAY IN IOWA, HE\nSAID IN REFERENCE TO THIS HE CALLED HILLARY CLINTON THE PRIME\nSUSPECT IN A FAR REACHING CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION.\nSO NOW WE FIND OW THAT THIS NEWLY DISCOVERED TROVE OF\nE-MAILS. NOTHING CHANGED FROM WHERE WE\nWERE OVER THE CENTER. IS IT FAIR TO SAY FROM YOUR\nSTANDPOINT MILLIONS OF VOTES CAST OVER THE LAST NINE DAYS.\nDONALD TRUMP GOT TO SPEND NINE DAYS SAYING THINGS LIKE I READ\nBACK TO YOU PRIME SUSPECT IN WIDE RANGING CRIMINAL\nINVESTIGATION. IS IT FAIR TO SAY YOU GUYS GOT\nAN ADVANTAGE HERE BASED ON ACTUALLY NOTHING HAPPENING?\n>> THAT'S NOT TRUE, SOMETHING DID HAPPEN.\nTHE FBI DIRECTOR SAID HE WAS RELAUNCHING AN INVESTIGATION OR\nREOPENING THE OLD ONE, I SAW IT DIFFERENTLY.\nTHAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH US.

THE FACT PEOPLE DON'T TRUST THIS\nWOMAN AND SHE CAN'T GET ABOVE 50% IN ANY OF THESE STATES AND\nSTAY THERE WON'T CHANGE TODAY. >> AGAIN, DONALD TRUMP'S\nCAMPAIGN MANAGER KELLYANNE CONWAY.\nTHAT WAS HER FIRST TELEVISION INTERVIEW SINCE COMEY'S\nANNOUNCEMENT THIS AFTERNOON. HERE NOW ON SET WITH US MSNBC\nCORRESPONDENT ARI FLEISCHER. I'M DIZZY ON EACH CAMPAIGN\nCHANGING ITS MIND. WHEN IT BROKE TODAY NEWT\nGINGRICH SAID COMEY BOWING TO PARTISAN PRESSURE PUTTING THIS\nLETTER OUT. HILLARY CLINTON SAID HE BOWED TO\nPOLITICAL PRESSURE WHEN HE PUT THE FIRST LETTER OUT.\nWHAT DO YOU MAKE OF HIS ACTIONS THEN AND NOW?\nHOW DO YOU MAKE SENSE OF THIS? >> THOSE RESPONSES ARE CREDIBLE.\nWHY THEY HAVE THE RULE, LIKE A 60 DAY RULE NOT TO GET INTO THE\nHEAT OF CAMPAIGNS. I THOUGHT THE SECOND LETTER\nTODAY WAS EXTRAORDINARY, UNUSUAL, AND REFLECTS CLEAREST\nEVIDENCE THAT JIM COMEY MISFIRED IN THE FIRST LETTER.\nTHE FIRST LETTER DIDN'T SAY I'LL BE BACK IN NINE DAYS WITH AN\nUPDATE. IT WAS WRITTEN TO SOUND LIKE THE\nEND OF SOMETHING FOR A WHILE AND IT WASN'T.\nLET'S LOOK BACK AT THAT FIRST LETTER AND REMEMBER WHAT WE'VE\nLEARNED. THE FIRST LETTER SAID, LOOK, FBI\nLEARNED OF E-MAILS THAT APPEAR TO BE PERTINENT BUT CANNOT YET\nASSESS WHETHER IT'S SIGNIFICANT TO TRANSLATE THE LEGAL JARGON.\nWE FOUND SOMETHING BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS AND WHAT IT\nMEANS, IF ANYTHING. NINE DAYS LATER WHAT THE FBI IS\nSAYING AND IT'S SIGNIFICANT WHEN AN FBI COMMITS A LETTER LIKE\nTHIS TO UPDATE, HE'S SAYING, NEVER MIND.\nNOTHING HERE. TO PIVOT OFF WHAT IT DIDN'T SAY\nOR DID SAY. WHAT'S IMPORTANT WHEN WE LOOK AT\nTHIS COVERAGE, IT'S NOW CLEAR FBI DIRECTOR COMEY GOT THE\nPROCESS WRONG, MADE A PROCEDURAL MISTAKE AND THAT'S WHY HE'S\nBASICALLY HAD TO HAVE A DO-OVER. WHETHER THE SUBSTANCE IS WRONG\nIS WHAT THEY CARE ABOUT. THE ORIGINAL INVESTIGATION WITH\nALL ITS RESEARCH COME TO THE RIGHT CONCLUSION OF NO CHARGES\nOR WRONG CONCLUSION AND FOLKS CAN DEBATE THAT FROM THE\nOUTSIDE. BUT THE NOTION THAT A FEW MORE\nSTRAY E-MAILS FROM A PERSON, HUMA ABEDIN, WHO WAS PART OF THE\nORIGINAL INQUIRY, WERE GOING TO CHANGE THAT CONCLUSION WAS\nALWAYS UNLIKELY. >> ARI MELBER, OUR CHIEF LEGAL\nCORRESPONDENT.", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1478479631427.1478475826563.08f84f02-4708-40c4-9653-d839fcc57957.segment0.thumb.jpg", "channel": "356"}, {"start": 502822, "length": 30970.0, "end": 533792.0, "date": 1478475828805, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1478479628944.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1478475826563-08f84f02-4708-40c4-9653-d839fcc57957-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=502.82,533.79", "text": ">> THANK YOU.\n>>> COMING UP, WE ARE, OF COURSE, TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE\nPOLITICAL FALLOUT OF THIS LATEST LETTER COULD BE.\nWHERE DOES THE RACE STAND RIGHT NOW 48 HOURS UNTIL ELECTION DAY.\nNBC NEWS \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" POLL, WE'LL TAKE YOU THROUGH ALL\nTHESE NUMBERS.

AS YOU MENTIONED IN 2000, THE\nDUI ARREST OF GEORGE W. BUSH IN 1976 WAS REVEALED MIDWEEK\nBEFORE. IN '92 THE WEINBERGER INDICTMENT\nWHICH DID HURT GEORGE H.W. BUSH BY THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR\nSUGGESTING HE KNEW MORE ABOUT THE IRAN CONTRASCANDAL THAN HE\nSUGGESTED. BUT THOSE WERE FOUR DAYS BEFORE.\nHERE WE ARE TWO DAYS BEFORE. BUT STEVE, THE THING I THINK IS\nGOING TO BE ASTOUNDING TO PEOPLE WE'VE GOT NINE DAYS THE VOTERS\nVOTING UNDER THE SPELL OF THIS COMEY LETTER.\nIN THOSE EARLIER CASES I TALKED ABOUT, THERE WASN'T ANYWHERE\nNEAR THE SPREAD OF EARLY VOTING THAT WE NOW HAVE IN 2016.\nAN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE DURING THE LAST NINE DAYS HAVE BEEN\nVOTING UNDER THE MISAPPREHENSION BECAUSE OF THAT FIRST LETTER\nTHAT HILLARY CLINTON WAS IN TROUBLE, FLAMES THAT WERE FANNED\nBY DONALD TRUMP. I THINK WHAT THIS REALLY IS\nGOING TO SUGGEST IN THE FUTURE IS THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE\nTO LOOK AT DO WE WANT TO HAVE SITUATIONS IN THE FUTURE WHERE\nHOWEVER WELL INTENTIONED HE MAY HAVE BEEN, AN FBI DIRECTOR CAN\nHAVE THIS MUCH IMPACT ON OUR POLITICAL PROCESS AT THE LAST\nMINUTE. >> I ALSO WONDER, TOO, WE TALK\nSO MUCH ABOUT POLARIZATION AND PARTISANSHIP AND HOW THAT\nCHANGED AND SORT OF EVOLVED OVER THE YEARS, WHERE IF YOU HAD A\nSTORY LIKE THIS MAYBE IN THE PAST, MAYBE THE MOTIVES OF THE\nFBI DIRECTOR WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN IN ALL CASES IN THE STORY\nWOULDN'T HAVE BEEN QUESTIONED AND CHALLENGED BY EACH SIDE AS\nMUCH AS THEY HAVE BEEN. IT'S SORT OF THE EROSION OF\nAUTHORITY, HOW POLARIZATION AND PARTISANSHIP, WHETHER IT'S FROM\nTHE NEWS MEDIA, WHETHER IT'S FROM THE FBI DIRECTOR, THERE'S\nTHAT EROSION OF AUTHORITATIVE VOICES IN OUR POLITICS.\n>> YOU ARE SO RIGHT. WE'D LOVE TO THINK WE CAN TRUST\nTHE FBI AND CONSIDER ITS DIRECTOR ABOVE POLITICS.\nTHE MAIN REASON WE SHOULD FEEL THAT WAY IS BECAUSE FOR DECADES\nTHE HEAD OF THE FBI WAS J. EDGAR HOOVER NOTORIOUS MEDDLING IN\nPOLITICS BLACK MAILING POLITICIANS.\n1964 LYNDON JOHNSON'S MOST IMPORTANT THING BRINGING CIVIL\nRIGHTS TO THE COUNTRY, CIVIL RIGHTS ACT AND LATER ON VOTING\nRIGHTS. AT THE SAME TIME HE HAD A\nMAVERICK FBI DIRECTOR J. EDGAR HOOVER WHO WAS PERSONALLY\nLEAKING DAMAGING INFORMATION TO REPORTERS ON MARTIN LUTHER KING,\nWHO WAS LBJ'S GREATEST CIVIL RIGHTS ALLY.\nTHOSE WERE THE TIMES WE HAD A RIGHT TO THINK WE WERE LONG\nPAST. >> MICHAEL BESCHLOSS,\nPRESIDENTIAL NEWS HISTORIAN.

AND WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING\nTO HAPPEN WITH REGARDS TO EITHER CANDIDATE WINNING?\n>> WELL, I THINK THE MARKET WILL BREATHE A SIGH OF RELIEF ONCE\nTHIS UNCERTAINTY IS OVER. THAT WE CAN BE FAIRLY SURE.\nI THINK IF WE SEE CLINTON TAKING THE WHITE HOUSE, THAT'S A BIT OF\nA CONTINUATION OF WHAT WE'VE GOT.\nSTOCKS SOLD OFF LAST WEEK AS WE KNOW.\nTHEY'RE RELATIVELY POISED. WE ARE SEEING A BIT OF A BOUNCE\nTODAY FOLLOWING THE FBI STORIES OVER THE WEEKEND.\nAND, OF COURSE, I THINK TECHNICALLY THE S&P IS NATURALLY\nLOOKING QUITE OVERSOLD RIGHT NOW.\nSO THIS CERTAINLY COULD BE A NICE RELIEF RALLY ONCE THE\nUNCERTAINTY IS BEHIND US. OF COURSE, IF WE WOULD SEE\nDONALD TRUMP TAKE THE WHITE HOUSE, THEN I THINK MARKETS WILL\nHAVE THE UNCERTAINTY CONTINUE BECAUSE, OF COURSE, HE'S AN\nUNKNOWN CANDIDATE. UNKNOWN QUANTITY.\nTHE ONE THING I WOULD COME BACK TO IN THAT EVENT IS ALTHOUGH HE\nBRINGS A LOT OF THEATER WITH HIM, THE U.S. CONSTITUTION IS\nSET UP QUITE ROBUSTLY. AND I THINK THAT IF WE WERE TO\nSEE ANY SELL-OFF, THEN THE CHECKS AND BALANCES WOULD COME\nUNDER SCRUTINY IN THE POLITICAL ARENA.\nAND NUMBER TWO, THE UNDERLYING STRENGTH OF THE U.S. ECONOMY,\nWHICH IS POSTING SOME DECENT DATA BEATS OVER THE PAST SIX TO\nEIGHT WEEKS WOULD COME THROUGH AGAIN.\nSO EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT WE WERE TO TAKE A STEP INTO THE\nUNKNOWN WITH DONALD TRUMP, WE WOULD ACTUALLY PUT OUR FAITH\nBACK IN THE U.S. ECONOMY AND LOOK TO BUY ON ANY SIGNS OF\nWEAKNESS. BUT BROADLY SPEAKING, I THINK\nTHE MARKETS JUST WANT THIS BEHIND THEM.\nTHEY HAVE TO FOCUS BACK ON ECONOMICS AND FUNDAMENTALS.\n>> REPUBLICANS HAVE CONTROLLED THE HOUSE AND SENATE FOR SIX\nYEARS AND IT'S BEST NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE TO GET ANYTHING DONE\nGIVEN THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENCY. COULD WE SEE A SIMILAR ISSUE\nWITH REGARDS TO TRADE ESPECIALLY IF WE SEE THE REPUBLICANS RUN\nOFF WITH ONE OR BOTH OF THESE INSTITUTIONS NOW?\n>> WELL, YES AND NO. >> SORRY, AND IF IT'S A CLINTON\nWIN. >> IF IT'S A CLINTON WIN, YEAH,\nHISTORICALLY MARKETS SEEM TO LIKE THOSE KIND OF STALEMATE\nSITUATIONS. AND THE REASON BEING VERY\nSIMPLY, ONLY THE REALLY IMPORTANT STUFF GETS DONE.\nSO THE THING ABOUT THE U.S. IS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF\nTECHNOCRACY BEHIND THE SCENES. ULTIMATELY, IF YOU HAVE A\nREASONABLE TEAM, BOTH A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS AND A\nDEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT, THEN ULTIMATELY I THINK THAT THERE IS\nA COLLECTIVE WILL TO WANT TO MOVE THINGS FORWARD.\nI THINK THIS IS WHY THE MARKETS ARE RESPONDING BETTER TO HILLARY\nCLINTON THAN PERHAPS TO DONALD TRUMP.\nBECAUSE SHE IS A SEASONED POLITICIAN.\nOF COURSE, TRUMP IS UNKNOWN QUANTITY.\nAND I THINK THE MARKETS ARE JUST FOCUSING ON THE ABILITY OF\nPERHAPS A DIVIDED EXECUTIVE IN CONGRESS, BEING ABLE TO GET THE\nMOST IMPORTANT STUFF DONE. SO I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK\nIT'S A MAJOR IMPEDIMENT. ULTIMATELY WHAT IT WILL MEAN IS\nTHAT WE JUST CONTINUE TO SEE QUITE AED LO OF RHETORIC RATHER\nLIKE WHAT WE HAVE SEEN UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.\nAND BACK TO FUNDAMENTALS AND  SHOULD BE DOING.\n>> WE'LL FAST FORWARD TWO DAYS. BASED ON THE POLLS, WE'LL SAY\nHILLARY CLINTON WILL TAKE THE WHITE HOUSE NARROWLY WITH A WIN.\nWHAT ARE THE DECLINES GOING TO DO?\nWHY AND WHAT ELSE SHOULD THEY I DO?\n>> YOU RAISE AN IMPORTANT PART. ONCE THE POLITICS ARE ASIDE, WE\nNEED TO GO BACK TO LONG-TERM FUNDAMENTAL INVESTORS.\nTHAT'S HOW YOU ACCRUE WEALTH IN THE LONG RUN.\nWE WROTE A PAPER, \"LONG TERM CAPITAL MARKETS\" THAT LOOKS AT\nRETURNS FOR SIMPLE BALANCE PORTFOLIO MOVES OVER TIME.\nAND THE FUTURE IS NOT BRIGHT, QUITE FRANKLY, FOR A STATIC\n60/40 ALLOCATION. IT NEEDS TO BE MORE INVENTIVE.\nLOOK AT THE LONGER TERM FUNDAMENTALS IN THE ECONOMY.\nWE DO SEE LACKLUSTER PERFORMERS AROUND THE GLOBE.\nTHIS WILL BE PART OF A BALANCE PORTFOLIO, LIKE CREDIT, FOR\nINSTANCE. WE ALWAYS URGE INVESTORS TO GO\nBACK TO LOOK THROUGH THE SHORT-TERM NOISE AND MAKE\nDECISIONS BASED ON THE LONG-TERM FUNDAMENTALS, BUT USE THESE\nOPPORTUNITIES TO ENTER THE MARKETS.\n>> WHAT I FIND INTERESTING IS YOU MAKE A CASE FOR ACTIVE\nINVESTING VERSUS PASSIVE INVESTING.\nBUT WE KNOW ACTIVE INVESTING HAS RETURNED THE SAME SORT OF\nPOTENTIAL FOR INVESTORS AS IS PASSIVE INVESTING.\nWHY DO YOU THINK THAT WILL CHANGE?\n>> WELL, IF YOU LOOK AT THE SITUATION OVER THE PAST FIVE OR\nSIX YEARS, WE HAVE SEEN AN UNPRECEDENTED FLOOD OF CAPITAL\nINTO MARKETS. ONE THING I WOULD ARGUE IS THAT\nLIQUIDITY IS THE ALPHA. IF YOU HAVE AN AWFUL LOT OF\nMONEY CHASING OPPORTUNITIES, THERE'S NO BARGAINING FOR THE\nCAPITAL. EVERYTHING GETS INVESTED AND\nEVALUATIONS TEND TO MOVE AS ONE. AS WE GRADUALLY SEE THE CENTRAL\nBANKS NORMALIZE, AND THE FEDS ARE THE FIRST OFF THE MARK IN\nDOING THIS, IT WILL BE STEADY AND GRADUAL.\nBUT AS WE SEE CAPITAL LESS AVAILABLE, THEN THERE WILL BE\nMORE OPPORTUNITY TO DIFFERENTIATE WHEN INVESTMENT\nVENUES AND ALSO WITH RETURNS, POTENTIALLY LOW GROWTH, YOU WILL\nHAVE TO WORK HARDER TO FIND THE OPPORTUNITIES.\nSO THERE ACTIVE INVESTING SHOULD COME INTO ITS OWN.\n>> A LOT OF FUND MANAGERS WATCHING THIS MORNING ARE VERY\nRELIEVED TO HEAR ALL THAT BECAUSE THE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN\nBEATEN DOWN QUITE A BIT.

THE SURVEY CAME RIGHT BEFORE THE\nFBI CLEARED HER IN ITS LATEST PROBE SAYING IT IS STICKING WITH\nTHE RECOMMENDATION FROM JULY NOT TO PROSECUTE THE PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATE OVER THE E-MAILS ON HER PRIVATE SERVER.\nLET'S GET OUT TO HESSA NAJI ACTIVE IN THE REAL ESTATE\nBUSINESS, COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE, JOINING US FROM LOS\nANGELES. THANK YOU FOR GETTING UP EARLY\nOR STAYING UP LATE FOR US. WHICH CANDIDATE IS BETTER FOR\nYOUR BUSINESS? >> GOOD MORNING.\nIT'S A PLEASURE TO BE ON THE PROGRAM WITH YOU.\nTHAT HAS NOT REALLY BEEN CLEAR BASED ON THE ECONOMIC PLANS THAT\nBOTH SIDES HAVE SHARED, WHICH HAVE BEEN VERY LIMITED.\nTHERE'S REALLY NOT A CLEAR CHOICE THAT YOU CAN TRANSLATE\nINTO DIRECT EFFECT ON THE ECONOMY, DIRECT EFFECT ON THE\nREAL ESTATE BUSINESS. WHAT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE'RE\nHEARING FROM OUR CLIENTS, ALL TYPES OF CLIENTS, WHETHER THEY\nARE PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL INVESTOR, LARGE INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS,\nIS WHETHER THE ECONOMIC EXPANSION CAN KEEP GOING.\nWE'RE IN OUR SEVENTH YEAR NOW AND MOST RECOVERIES IN THE U.S.\nHAVE LASTED ON AVERAGE ABOUT FIVE YEARS.\nTHE FUNDAMENTALS CERTAINLY POINT TO A CONTINUATION OF JOB GROWTH,\nWHICHEVER ADMINISTRATION IS REALLY -- WHICHEVER SIDE IS\nCHOSEN AS THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION.\nBUT THE QUESTION IS, TO WHAT DEGREE WILL THE ECONOMY CONTINUE\nTO CREATE JOBS? AND TO WHAT DEGREE WILL WE SEE\nTHE KINDS OF FAVORABLE FUNDAMENTALS ON THE REAL ESTATE\nSIDE. THE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE HAS\nREALLY STOOD OUT GLOBALLY AS A SAFEHAVEN BECAUSE OF THE YIELDS\nAND THE 5% TO 7% RANGE AT A TIME WHEN THIS LATE IN AN EXPANSION\nWE WOULD BE SEEING A LOT OF CRANES AND A LOT OF\nOVERBUILDING. WE'RE NOT SEEING THAT.\nAND THEREFOR THERE'S STILL A LOT OF CAPITAL ATTRACTED TO\nCOMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE. THERE'S SOME UNCERTAINTY\nREGARDING THE MOMENTUM OF THE ECONOMY.\nAND I THINK WHOEVER WINS THE ELECTION WILL BEGIN TO SEE SOME\nCLARITY. AND THAT SHOULD BEGIN TO PAINT A\nBETTER MORE CLEARER PICTURE OF WHERE THE ECONOMY IS HEADED.\nTHEREFOR WHERE REAL ESTATE IS HEADED.\n>> WHAT ABOUT THE FED, THOUGH, IN THE CASE OF A CLINTON WIN.\nMARKET PARTICIPANTS EXPECT TO SEE A 25-BASIS POINTS IN\nDECEMBER BY THE FED. WOULD THAT DERAIL SOME OF THE\nMOMENTUM THAT YOU HAVE SEEN IN THE MARKETS?\n>> WE DON'T EXPECT IT TO BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY BEEN BAKED INTO\nEXPECTATIONS IS THAT THE FED WILL START TO RAISE RATES\nBECAUSE IT IS HAPPENING FOR THE RIGHT REASONS.\nWE'RE BEGINNING TO SEE SOME INFLATION BUILD UP.\nWE HAVE SEEN SUCH CONSISTENT JOB GROWTH HERE IN THE U.S.\nWITHOUT OVERHEATING AND WITHOUT REALLY BUILDING UP TOO MUCH\nPRESSURE ON INFLATION, THEREFOR THE MARKET EXPECTS A MEASURED\nPACE OF INTEREST RATE INCREASES THAT COINCIDE WITH CONTINUED JOB\nGROWTH. THEREFOR CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT\nOF OCCUPANCIES AND RENTS. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT WE\nHAVE SEEN IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS HAS BEEN THE TREMENDOUS RECOVERY\nIN OCCUPANCY LEVELS AND DEMAND FOR VARIOUS TYPES OF REAL\nESTATE. AND MOST PEOPLE THINK ABOUT\nCOMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE IN THE U.S. AS OFFICE BUILDINGS AND\nSHOPPING CENTERS AND APARTMENT BUILDINGS.\nBUT THERE'S A WIDE RANGE OF INVESTMENT CHOICE, WHETHER IT IS\nSELF-STORAGE PROPERTIES OR MEDICAL OFFICE PROPERTIES OR\nSMALL RESTAURANTS, SINGLE-TENANT RESTAURANTS SHOWING PHENOMENAL\nYIELDS.

HASSAM, LAST WE SPOKE A COUPLE\nMONTHS AGO YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN\nGROWTH ON THE COASTLINES OF THE U.S. AND INTERNAL GROWTH AS\nWELL. ARE YOU STILL SEEING A\nDIFFERENCE IN DEMAND? >> WE ARE.\nAND WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING ABOUT THE LATEST STAGES OF THIS\nEXPANSION IS THE BROADENING OF IT.\nYOU'RE RIGHT, THE COASTAL MARKETS HAVE REALLY KEPT A\nFASTER PACE OF JOB CREATION. THEY ARE THE FAVORED MARKETS BY\nINSTITUTIONAL CAPITAL. SO MORE CAPITAL TENDS TO FLOW\nINTO THOSE MARKETS. BUT OF LATE WE HAVE SEEN PLACES\nLIKE NASHVILLE, MINNEAPOLIS, PORTLAND, OREGON, THAT HAVE\nPOSTED A STRONG JOB NUMBER. >> WE'VE GOT TO GO, HASSAM.\nTHAT'S IT FOR TODAY.

WE HAVE SEEN NINE STRAIGHT DAYS\nOF DECLINES FOR THE S&P AND THE DOW.\nBUT FOR THE WEEK AS A WHOLE, THE DOW AND THE S&P WERE DOWN 2%.\nTHE NASDAQ DOWN 3%. WE'RE UP THIS MORNING ABOUT\n1.6%, 1.7%.

THE OPINIONS DIFFER.\nI THINK MY GENERAL CONCLUSION IS THAT HE HAS CERTAINLY THE TRAITS\nOF THE AUTHORITARIAN MEN YOU SAY IN THE 1930s TALKING ABOUT\nENEMIES WITHIN, TALKING ABOUT HOW HE ALONE CAN CREATE NATIONAL\nREJUVENATION THAT COMES WITH A STRONG MAN UNDER VIOLENCE.\nBUT YOU ALSO HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THERE ARE ELEMENTS OF THE\nFASCIST MOVES IN THE '30s WHICH SUDDENLY ARE NOT THERE, FOR\nEXAMPLE, HITLER AND MOUSSILINI HAD THE BROWN AND BLACK SHIRTS\nBACKING THEM. IN THAT SENSE, DONALD TRUMP IS\nNOT A FASCIST, BUT HE'S CERTAINLY FAR MORE\nAAUTHORITARIAN THAN BOUND BY DEMOCRATIC RULES THAN MOST\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST.\n>> AND GIDEON, I KNOW THERE ARE STRONG VIEWS ON THIS TOPIC IN\nLONDON AND OTHER PLACES IN THE OP-EDS COMING OUT OF THE CENTERS\nRATHER THAN OUT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nWHAT ABOUT ON THE OTHER CANDIDATE?\nHOW STRONG ARE THE OPINIONS TOWARDS CLINTON ON SOME OF THING\nAATIONS YOU DO SEE TOWARDS HER. I MEAN, FOR ONE OF THE BETTER\nWORDS THAT TRUMP USES IN TERMS OF HER BEING CROOKED, IS THE\nSTRENGTH OF OPINION ON HER WITH THAT ACCUSATION SIMILAR TO WHAT\nWE JUST DISCUSSED WITH TRUMP? >> NO.\nI MEAN, I FOUND VERY, VERY FEW PEOPLE IN BRITAIN OR EUROPE WHO\nTAKE THIS STUFF SERIOUSLY, THE E-MAIL, THE BENGHAZI STUFF, IT'S\nODD IF YOU TALK TO AMERICAN CONSERVERS ABOUT IT, THEY FEEL\nINCREDIBLY STRONG AND EMOTIONAL ABOUT IT.\nBUT PERSONALLY, IT'S HARD FOR ME TO EVEN REMEMBER THE DETAILS OF\nWHAT SHE'S ALLEGED HAVE DONE. THERE IS A SLIVER OF OPINION IN\nBRITAIN THAT TAKES ON THE HATRED OF HILLARY CLINTON AND THEREFOR\nARE THE PRO-TRUMP FEELING. AND THOSE ARE THE POPULIST RIGHT\nIN BRITAIN. NIGEL FARRAD IS PRO-TRUMP.\nTHE FAR RIGHT LEADER IN FRANCE SAID SHE WANTS TRUMP TO WIN.\nSO THE FAR RIGHT OR THE POPULIST RIGHT IN EUROPE ARE PRO-TRUMP\nAND THEREFOR INCLINED TO BUY THE TRUMP NARRATIVE ON HILLARY\nCLINTON. >> WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING LIKE\nYOU HAVE AT THE FT, THE REACTION IN THE MARKETS, ESPECIALLY LAST\nWEEK AND IN ECONOMICS AND TRYING TO TELL THE STORY FOR INVESTORS\nOF WHAT THE RISKS ARE OF A TRUMP PRESIDENCY.\nIT DOES SEEM LIKE YOU SAW A LITTLE MORE DAMAGE IN STOCK\nMARKETS OVERSEAS, LIKE IN EUROPE AND IN EMERGING MARKETS TO THIS\nPROSPECT. DO YOU THINK THAT IS WHERE THE\nRISKS LIE? >> WELL, YEAH, LOOKING AT THE\nMARKETS, THAT MAY REFLECT GENERAL SENTIMENT.\nOBVIOUSLY, IF SOMETHING LIKE 45, MAYBE 50% OF AMERICANS ARE GOING\nTO VOTE FOR TRUMP, A LOT OF AMERICANS ALREADY NORMALIZE THAT\nIDEA IN THEIR HEADS, WHEREAS I THINK IN EUROPE CERTAINLY IT'S\nSTILL REGARDED AS ABSOLUTELY EXTRAORDINARY.\nALMOST UNTHINKABLE THAT DONALD TRUMP COULD BE PRESIDENT.\nAND THEREFOR YOU ARE LIKELY TO HAVE AN EMOTIONAL REACTION IN\nTHE MARKETS. BUT THERE'S ALSO A MORE ECONOMIC\nASPECT TO IT, WHICH IS THAT IF YOU TAKE TRUMP AT HIS WORD, HE'S\nNOW A PROTECTIONIST AND WOULD IMPOSE TARIFFS ON COUNTRIES LIKE\nJAPAN AND CHINA AND THEREFOR REALLY TAKING AN AX TO THE WORLD\nTRADING SYSTEM.

SO EXPLAIN WHAT IS UP WITH\nMINNESOTA. >> WELL, PRETTY OF THE SAME\nTHING. DONALD TRUMP IS GETTING NOTHING\nBUT BLUE STATES. HE STARTED THE MORNING OUT IN\nCOLORADO, A STATE THAT OBAMA WON IN 2012 AND WHERE HILLARY\nCLINTON HAS AN EDGE IN THE POLLS.\nTHEY SAY EVEN THOUGH HE DIDN'T DO ANY POLLING THERE, THEY ARE\nHEARING THAT IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMPETE AND THERE HAVEN'T\nBEEN A LOT OF POLLS IN MINNESOTA.\nTHIS IS A RISKY STRATEGY, BUT ONE TO SIGNAL THAT TRUMP IS\nTRYING IN THE LAST 48 HOURS TO APPEAL TO SUBURBAN SWING VOTERS,\nMIDDLE CLASS VOTERS, MODERATE, UNDECIDED.\nBUT HE'S DOING THIS IN THE BLUE STATES AND HE WILL END UP\nTONIGHT IN FLORIDA. THAT IS A STATE THAT BARACK\nOBAMA BEAT MITT ROMNEY IN. TRUMP NEEDS TO FLIP THAT RED.\nIF HE DOES, THE MATH WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT.\nPUT THIS WAY, TRUMP HAS TO WIN ALL OF ROMNEY STATES AND FIND\nENOUGH TO COME UP WITH ANOTHER 66 ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES.\nVIRGINIA, FLORIDA, NORTH CAROLINA ARE HIS FIRST TARGETS.\nBUT HE HAS TO DO WELL OUR AT LEAST MAKE HILLARY CLINTON\nDEFEND THE BLUE STATES. SFWR IT'S A GRUELING STATES.\nTEN STOPS IN TWO DAYS. HOW ARE THE RALLIES GOING IN THE\nCLOSING DAYS? >> RALLIES ARE FINE.\nHE'S PACKING HOUSES. HE'S USED A FEW SMALLER VENUES\nBECAUSE HE DOESN'T EXPECT TO GET $10,000 OR $15,000 IN SOME OF\nTHEM. BUT THERE HAS BEEN BECAUSE OF\nTHE VERY VIGOROUS PACE THAT HE'S KEEPING, TRUMP IS GETTING\nLOOSER. FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEK\nREALLY SINCE THE OBAMA CARE PREMIUM SPIKES WERE ANNOUNCED\nBEFORE THE COMEY ANNOUNCEMENT ON THE E-MAILS, TRUMP WAS BEING\nVERY DISCIPLINED, MOSTLY TELEPROMPTERS.\nAND IN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS, HE'S BEEN A LITTLE AGGRESSIVE\nAND OF COURSE LAST FLIGHT WAS AN AMAZING EVENT IN RENO WHERE\nSECRET SERVICE HAD TO HUSTLE HIM OFF THE STAGE WHERE SOMEONE\nSHOUTED A GUN. THAT WILL DEFINITELY RATTLE YOUR\nRHETORIC. SO LAST COUPLE OF DAYS, THEY CAN\nSAY JUST ABOUT ANYTHING, AND WITH DONALD TRUMP, WHO KNOW WHAT\nIS THAT WILL BE. >> IT'S BEEN A AMONG ROAD.\nALMOST THERE.

AND I'M JUST GOING TO RANDOM\nPLACES. THE AMOUNT OF ENTHUSIASM IN THIS\nSTATE AND EVERYWHERE I'VE GONE FRANKLY IS INCREDIBLE.\nPEOPLE WANT THEIR COUNTRY BACK. PEOPLE ARE SICK AND TIRED OF\nCAREER POLITICIANS.

AND NOW PERHAPS I'M AS OUTSIDE\nAS YOU COULD POSSIBLY GET. WHAT CHANGES HAVE YOU SEEN IN\nTHE MAN, IN YOUR FATHER, OVER THE COURSE OF THIS JOURNEY?\n>> WELL, I LOVE MY FATHER TO DEATH.\nHE'S INCREDIBLE AND QUITE FRANKLY THE FIGHT THAT HE'S HAD\nIS INSPIRATIONAL TO ANYBODY ESPECIALLY TO HIS SON.\nAND HERE IS A PERSON WHO DID NOT NEED TO BE DOING THIS.\nAND I SAY THAT A LOT. WE HAVE A GREAT COMPANY, AMAZING\nFAMILY. HE DID NOT HAVE TO RUN FOR\nCOMMANDER IN CHIEF. BUT THIS COUNTRY WAS BEING\nFLUSHEDED DOWN THE DRAIN BY CAREER POLITICIANS LINING THEIR\nOWN POCKETS THE WHOLE WAY. WE HAVE $20 TRILLION WORTH OF\nDEBT, OBAMACARE IS FAILING, 95 MILLION AMERICANS OUT OF THE\nWORKFORCE. MEDIAN INCOME HASN'T GONE UP IN\nTHE UNITED STATES IN 15 YEARS. WE'VE LOST 70,000 FACTORIES IN\nTHE UNITED STATES. NASA.\nI COULD GO ON AND ON AND OUR POLITICIANS AREN'T DOING A\nSINGLE THING ABOUT IT. WE NEED SOMEBODY TO START\nFIGHTING FOR THIS COUNTRY AGAIN AND QUITE FRANKLY, THAT IS HIGH\nFATHER. HE WOULD DO AN AMAZING JOB FOR\nTHAT NATION. >> AND THERE ARE REPORTS THAT\nTHERE ARE CONCERN WITH THAT THE FAMILY ABOUT THE BRAND, THAT IF\nHE LOSE, THE TRUMP BRAND WILL BE TARNISHED IN SOME WAY.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? >> FIRST OF ALL, IT WON'T BE.\nAND SECOND OF ALL, THIS IS -- HONESTLY, THE BRAND IS\nINCONSEQUENTIAL TO EVERYTHING THAT HE'S DONE.\nHE'S CREATED A MOVEMENT OF HARD WORKING MEN AND WOMEN IN THIS\nCOUNTRY WHO WANT THEIR NATION BACK, WHO DON'T THINK THEY HAVE\nA VOICE ANYMORE. WHO AREN'T BEING HEARD BY THE\nPOLITICIANS. WE'RE BEING LEFT BEHIND.\n94 MILLION AMERICANS I MENTIONED BEFORE THAT ARE OUT OF THE WORK\nFORCE. 33& OF AMERICANS SINCE 2001 WHO\nHAVE LOST THEIR JOBS IN MANUFACTURING BECAUSE THOUGH\nJOBS HAVE LEFT THE COMPANY. >>.\n>> SO IF IT DOESN'T GO YOUR FATHER'S WAY ON TUESDAY, WHAT\nHAPPENS TO ALL THOSE PEOPLE THOO THAT HE'S IGNITED?\n>> WELL, I THINK PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE UPSET.\nAND I DON'T KNOW, I MEAN,'S CREATED AN INCREDIBLE ME.\n. THIS ISN'T A CAMPAIGN, IT'S A\nMOVEMENT TO GET AMERICA BACK ON TRACK.\nSO MANY PEOPLE, VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE THINK AMERICA IS GOING IN\nTHE WRONG DIRECTION AND WASHINGTON IS NOT SERVING THEIR\nINTERESTS. SO WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO EXPAND\nWASHINGTON, D.C., WHY WOULD YOU WANT MORE GOVERNMENT WHEN QUITE\nFRANKLY THE GOVERNMENT WE HAVE ISN'T SERVING THE AMERICAN\nPEOPLE WELL? I THINK THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE\nBETWEEN A HILLARY CLINTON PRESIDENCY AND DONALD TRUMP\nPRESIDENCY. >> ERIC, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nALWAYS GOOD TO TALK TO YOU. WE'LL KEEP IN TOUCH OVER THE\nNEXT COUPLE DAYS. >> SO WHERE DOES THE RACE STAND?\nWE'RE READING THROUGH THE TEA LEAVES.\nEARLY VOTING IN NORTH CAROLINA. APPEARS TO FAVOR REPUBLICANS.\nEARLY VOTING IN FLORIDA APPEARS TO BE ABSOLUTELY RAZOR TIGHT.\nCOIN TOSS. AND EARLY VOTING IN NEVADA PAIRS\nTO FAVOR HILLARY CLINTON. GENERALLY SPEAKING, IS THAT\nWHERE WE ARE? >> THAT IS WHERE WE ARE.\nAND DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO DIFFERENT STATES LIKE MINNESOTA,\nWHICH HASN'T GONE REPUBLICAN SINCE 1972.\nTHE REASON HE'S LOOKING AT MIGHT BE MIFRN MIP AND MICHIGAN ABOUT,\nWHEN YOU GO TO THE ELECTORAL MAP, YOU GIVE TRUMP ALL OF MITT\nROMNEY STATES FROM 2012, RIGHT, AND THAT INCLUDES WINNING NORTH\nCAROLINA. REALLY IMPORTANT THERE.\nYOU'RE ONLY AT 206. CARL MENTIONED YOU HAVE TO GET A\nLOT MORE. YOU HAVE TO WIN FLORIDA, OHIO,\nAND THEN YOU'VE GOT TO WIN IOWA. THAT GETS YOU TO 2259.\nYOU'RE STILL 11 SHORT. NEVADA IS ONLY 6, IT DOESN'T GET\nTHROUGH. BUT SOME OF THE BIG STATES,\nPENNSYLVANIA AND MICHIGAN IN PARTICULAR, THEY SOLVE ALL YOUR\nPROBLEMS IF YOU'RE DONALD TRUMP STUCK AT 259.\n>> LESS THAN WOULD DAYS BEFORE THE POLLS OPEN AND HE'S IN\nMINNESOTA. LAST TIME MINNESOTA WENT\nREPUBLICAN IS 1972. >> HE'S GETTING BIG CROWDS\nEVERYWHERE HE GOES. I WAS OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF A\nSOYBEAN FIELD THURSDAY NIGHT IN NORTH CAROLINA.\nHE GOT MORE THAN 15,000 PEOPLE THERE.\nSO HE IS DRAWING VERY GOOD CROWDS.\nAND THAT IS ONE OF THE CROWDS THAT KEEPS THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN\nGOING. HE LOOKS AT THE POLLS, HE SEES\nTHAT THERE SEEMS TO BE AN EQUILIBRIUM WITH HILLARY\nCLINTON, BUT HE SAYS MY CROWDS ARE SO BIG, THERE HAS TO BE MORE\nSUPPORT OUT THERE. >> HILLARY CLINTON WAS IN\nPHILADELPHIA. SHE WILL IN CLEVELAND AND MAN\nMANCHESTER. >> PENNSYLVANIA, YOU DON'T HAVE\nEARLY VOTING THERE. AND SO THEY HAVE NOT CAST THEIR\nVOTE.

PUBLIC POLL, HILLARY CLINTON HAS\nA LEAD IN MICHIGAN. PERHAPS THERE IS A PRIVATE POLL\nTHAT SAYS THAT, BUT IT IS NOT UNHEARD OF FOR POLITICAL FIGURES\nTO ACT AS IF A RACE IS NECK AND NECK WHEN IT'S REALLY NOT.\nSO I WOULD NOT THE SAY THAT TRUMP IS LEADING.\n>> AND I WOULD TO THAT MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE WAS\nTHE EXPECTED LAST STOP FOR TRUMP ON MONDAY NIGHT.\nHE HAS SINCE ADDED ANOTHER VISIT BACK TO MICHIGAN, GRAND RAPIDS\nFORKS AN 11:00 EAST COAST TIME RALLY ON THE EVE BEFORE THE\nELECTION. >> YOU WANT TO CREATE A SENSE OF\nEXCITEMENT AND MOMENTUM THAT MIGHT GET PEOPLE TO THE POLLS\nWHO OTHERWISE MIGHT NOT HAVE GONE.\n>> BYRON, NICE TO SEE YOU.

TRUMP HAS NOT YET REACTED TO\nDIRECTOR COMEY OF THE FBI DECISION THAT THE CONCLUSIONS\nDON'T CHANGE. HIS RUNNING MATE, AS ED HENRY\nPLAYED EARLY, AND KELLY ANNE CONWAY HAS SAID, IT DOESN'T\nCHANGE MUCH IN THEIR VIEW. WE ALREADY KNEW THEY LIED TO THE\nFBI ABOUT THE NUMBER OF DEVICES THAT SHE HAD, THERE WERE A WHOLE\nSERIES OF OTHER PROBLEMS AND THAT SHE WAS CALLED RECKLESS AND\nEXTREMELY RECKLESS BY THE FBI DIRECTOR.\nSO THEY ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO MARCH AS THOUGH -- AS TRUMP\nLIKES TO SAY -- CORRUPT HILLARY IS STILL COLLUDING WITH THE\nJUSTICE DEPARTMENT, HIS WORDS, NOT MINE.\nAND THAT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CHANGE.\nDONALD TRUMP'S CASTING HIMSELF AS THE OUTSIDER, ANNOUNCING HE\nWAS AN INSIDER FOR YEARS. SO IN THE SHORT 18 MONTHS, HE'S\nGONE FROM A VERY UNIQUE AND MANY REPUBLICANS THOUGHT UNLIKELY\nNOMINEE, TO A NOMINEE WHO IS WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE OF\nWINNING IN 24 TO 48 HOURS.

WE MADE LATE PLAYS BUT THE\nNUMBERS DIDN'T PAN OUT ON ELECTION DAY BUT ONE OF THE\nTHINGS THAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS TRYING TO DO THAT WE WERE\nALSO TRYING TO DO IN 2012, SEND A MESSAGE TO THE SUPPORTERS\nNATIONWIDE ABOUT OUR OPTIMISM THAT WE'RE -- WE'RE ON OFFENSE\nHERE. WE'RE TRYING TO EXPAND THE MAP.\nTHERE'S MOMENTUM ON OUR SIDE. >> THAT'S INTERESTING.\n>> AND NOT ONLY DO REPUBLICAN VOTERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY FEED\nOFF OF BUT VOLUNTEERS. THE IDEA THAT THEY ARE -- THAT\nTHEIR WORK ON THE GROUND MATTERS AT THAT MOMENT.\nWHEN YOU'RE IN THE STAGE OF THE CAMPAIGN AS DAN KNOWS, IT'S LESS\nABOUT PERSUASION AND MORE ABOUT MOBILIZATION, THAT'S AN\nIMPORTANT ELEMENT THAT THE CAMPAIGN HAS TO TAKE INTO\nCONSIDERATION. >> WHAT ABOUT THROWING MICHIGAN\nIN. TALK ABOUT SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN\nOUT AND ABOUT SO MUCH FOR HILLARY CLINTON, THEY ARE\nSENDING HIM TO ANN ARBOR THE DAY BEFORE ELECTION DAY, NOT GOING\nTO BE KICKING IT IN THE HOUSE BEHIND ME, BUT STUMPING FOR\nVOTES. THAT TELLS ME THOUGH I'M\nWONDERING IF THAT MEANS THE DEMS ARE NERVOUS, THAT THE PRESIDENT\nIS THERE THE DAY BEFORE. >> THERE ARE TWO REASONS HE'LL\nGO TO MICHIGAN. TRUMP HAS NO PATH UNLESS HE CAN\nPICK OFF MICHIGAN, WISCONSIN OR PENNSYLVANIA, NO OTHER WAY TO DO\nIT. THAT'S ONE.\nLET'S LOOK THAT. YOU DON'T GET EXTRA POINTS, YOU\nGET 270. LOCK THAT DOWN.\nSECOND, MICHIGAN, LIKE PENNSYLVANIA WHERE THEY WILL\nALSO BE ON MONDAY NIGHT, STATES WHERE THEY DO NOT HAVE\nSIGNIFICANT EARLY VOTE. ALL OF THE VOTE WILL BE DECIDED\nON TUESDAY. THEY'VE ALREADY BANKED MOST OF\nTHE VOTE IN FLORIDA AND MOST OF THE VOTE IN NEVADA AND COLORADO\nAND NORTH CAROLINA. THEY CAN DECIDE ENTIRELY BY\nTUESDAY.

BUT IT'S CLEVELAND.\nWE SAW ZELENY AHEAD OF LeBRON JAMES AND OHIO, IT IS CLOSE,\nCLOSE, CLOSE FOR THEM. >> I WOULD ARGUE THAT OHIO IS\nDIFFERENT THAN A STATE LIKE MICHIGAN OR PENNSYLVANIA.\n>> WHY? >> IN THAT TRUMP HAS A SLIGHT\nADVANTAGE IN TERMS OF DEMOGRAPHICS OF THIS STATE AND\nPROPORTION OF WHITE WORKING CLASS VOTERS THERE.\nIT'S REALLY WHOLE CASE FOR THE CAMPAIGN WAS THAT HE COULD\nAPPEAL TO RUST BELT VOTERS. IF HE CANNOT WIN IN OHIO, THAT'S\nGOING TO BODE POORLY FOR HIM ON ELECTION NIGHT AND DEAL A MORTAL\nBLOW TO HIS CAMPAIGN. CLINTON AND DEMOCRATS ARE\nPLAYING A SMART GAME AND SPENDING TIME THERE BECAUSE THEY\nRECOGNIZE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO DONALD TRUMP'S SFRATRATEGY.\nIF HE'S NOT WINNING IN OHIO, THERE'S NO WAY HE'S WINNING IN\nTHE OTHER STATES. HIS NIGHT WOULD BE OTHER.\n>> IT SHOWS YOU HOW FLUID THE RACE IS.\nA COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO WE WERE SAYING HILLARY CLINTON LOOKS\nLIKE SHE'S DONE IN OHIO, NOT GOING TO HAPPEN AND THERE'S JUST\nSO MUCH MOVEMENT IN THE NUMBERS THAT CLEARLY SHE'S BACK THERE.\n>> WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE IN THE CAMPAIGN, BOTH OF YOU BEING\nFORMER SOLDIERS AND KNOWING IN THOSE FINAL DAYS AND FINAL HOURS\nAND THE CRISSCROSSING AND SLEEPING WITH THE PHONE UNDER\nYOUR PILLOW -- >> THAT'S WEIRD.\n>> I BELIEVE YOU DID THAT. THE FINAL 72 HOURS ARE A BLUR.\nI MEAN YOU ALMOST CAN'T REMEMBER THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FRIDAY\nAND MONDAY. AND YOU CAN'T LEAVE ANYTHING TO\nCHANCE. THAT'S WIN OF THE THINGS THAT'S\nDRIVING SO MANY OF THESE CAMPAIGNS TO PICK UP AND GO TO\nMINNESOTA OR SHIFT AN EVENT TO WISCONSIN AT THE LAST MINUTE.\nBECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO LEAVE ANYTHING TO CHANCE.\nAGAIN, IT IS A MOBILIZATION GAME RIGHT NOW.\nAND YOU HAVE TO BASICALLY MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE PUTTING EVERY\nLAST OUNCE OF EFFORT YOU HAVE IN THE CAMPAIGN INTO GETTING PEOPLE\nOUT TO VOTE. >> ISN'T IT SORT OF A MIND GAME\nIN A WAY? I REMEMBER CHENEY WENT TO HAWAII\nIN THE FINAL DAYS OF THE -- >> I REMEMBER WHEN THE OBAMA\nCAMPAIGN WENT WITH RADIO ADS IN MINNESOTA, WHICH WAS ESSENTIALLY\nTO DRAW OUR RESOURCES AND TIME THERE.\nTHAT'S SOMETHING TOO THAT THOSE TYPE OF MIND GAMES I THINK --\nIT'S ALL OF THE THREE DIMENSIONAL GAME OF CHESS IN THE\nLAST 72 HOURS. >> THIS IS A TRUMP AD THAT IS\nNOW OUT AND TAPPER HAD ON AL FRANKEN RESPONDING, HIS OWN\nPERCEPTION OF THIS TRUMP AD. HERE YOU GO.\n>> THE ESTABLISHMENT HAS TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS AT STAKE IN\nTHIS ELECTION. FOR THOSE THAT CONTROL THE\nLEVERS OF POWER IN WASHINGTON AND GLOBAL SPECIAL INTERESTS,\nTHEY PARTNER WITH THESE PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE YOUR GOOD IN\nMIND. >> WELL, WHEN I SAW THE AD, I\nTHOUGHT THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING OF A GERMAN SHEPHERD WHISTLE, A\nDOG WHISTLE, TO SORT OF THE CERTAIN GROUP IN THE UNITED\nSTATES. I THINK I'M JEWISH, MAYBE I'M\nSENSITIVE TO IT BUT IT CLEARLY HAD SORT OF ELDERS OF ZION KIND\nOF FEEL TO IT, INTERNATIONAL BANKING -- PLOT OR CONSPIRACY\nRATHER. AND THEN A NUMBER OF JEWS --\n>> YOU KNOW WHOSE POINTING THE CRITICISM OF JANET YELLEN AND\nFOLKS WHO ARE JEWISH. HE'S SAYING IT WAS ANTI-SEMITIC,\nDOES ANYONE AGREE WITH HIM? >> I DON'T THINK HE'S BEING TOO\nSENSITIVE. IF YOU SPEND ANY TIME ON TWITTER\nOR FOLLOW THE JEWISH REPORTER WHO SAYS SOMETHING CRITICAL OF\nTRUMP OR SOME SUPPORTERS DON'T LIKE, THINGS YOU COULD NEVER\nIMAGINE BEING SAID PUBLIC IN AMERICA IN 2016 ARE BEING SAID\nON THEIR TWITTER BIOS AND THIS HAS BEEN AN ELEMENT THAT'S BEEN\nFUELING SOME ELEMENT OF TRUMP SUPPORTER.\nNOT ALL OF THEM BUT IT IS AN ELEMENT OF CAMPAIGN AND PART\nPERPETUATED BY BRIGHT BART -- >> I THINK DAN HAS A LOT OF GOOD\nPOINTS ON THAT. I THINK FROM A CAMPAIGN\nPERSPECTIVE, THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO DO IN THESE LAST 72\nHOURS IS INVITE THESE TYPE OF CONTROVERSY THAT BECOMES A\nDISTRACTION FOR YOUR CAMPAIGN. THE CAMPAIGN SHOULD HAVE BEEN\nWELL AWARE OF THE TYPE OF MESSAGE THEY COULD BE SENDING BY\nRUNNING SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND WHETHER OR NOT IT WOULD HAVE A\nDECOMPRESSIVE EFFECT ON REPUBLICANS WHO ARE COMING HOME\nAT THE LAST MINUTE HERE. IT'S -- UNFORCED ERROR.\n>> IT SHOWS WHAT A CLOSE MIND MELD AT THE STAGE IN THE\nCAMPAIGN THEY HAVE. THIS WASN'T ALWAYS THE CASE.\nTRUMP DIDN'T WORK WELL WITH PAUL MANAFORT HIS PRIOR MANAGER.\nHE AGREES WITH STEVE BANON. >> STAYING ON POINT.\nKEEPING HIM ON MESSAGE AND OFF TWITTER AND WHEN YOU LOOKS AT\nTHE POLLS IT SEEMS TO BE WORKING FOR HIM.\nLET ME ASK YOU ALL TO STICK AROUND.\nDON'T FORGET, DID YOU KNOW TUESDAY IS ELECTION DAY?\nSURPRISE IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN UNDER A ROCK.\nALL LEADING UP TO THE SUPER BOWL OF POLITICS, ELECTION NIGHT IN\nAMERICA. WE'LL HAVE EVERY RACE AND\nRESULT. STAY WITH CNN UNTIL THE LAST\nVOTE IS CAST. COMING UP NEXT, WE WANT TO TALK\nABOUT THE GHOST OFFAL GORE. WHY PERHAPS THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN\nIS BACK IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, PERHAPS FEARFUL OF WHAT HAPPENED\nIN 2000. WE'LL RECOMMEND NIS.\n>> DONALD TRUMP IS SUGGESTING THAT PARADING OUT STARS IS\nCHEATING. LET'S DISCUSS THAT.\nSPEAKING OF STARS AND CELEBRITY, STEVIE WONDER, MOMENTS FROM\nHEARING FROM HIM AS HE'LL INTRODUCE THE PRESIDENT OF THE\nUNITED STATES IN FLORIDA, ALL PART OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S\nFULL-COURT PRESS.

THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT DOING\nEVERYTHING WE CAN TO STOP THE MOVEMENT TO DESTROY PRESIDENT\nOBAMA'S LEGACY. >> AND BROOKE, THAT IS A CENTRAL\nPOINT HERE. THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN KNOWS THAT\nIT DOES NOT HAVE QUITE AS MUCH ENTHUSIASM AMONG\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS. HERE IN CUYAHOGA COUNTY, THE\nNUMBERS OF EARLY VOTING, I JUST LOOKED IT UP, 28% FROM WHERE IT\nWAS IN 2012. THOSE EARLY VOTING RULES HAVE\nCHANGED SO IT'S NOT EXACTLY APPLES TO ORANGES BUT IT'S ONE\nOF THE REASONS LeBRON JAMES, HIS ENDORSEMENT WILL HELP GET BLACK\nVOTERS TO THE POLLS. HILLARY CLINTON WAS TOUTING THIS\nENDORSEMENT WHEN SHE RECEIVED IT IN AKRON.\nLISTEN TO WHAT SHE SAID ABOUT KING JAMES.\n>> NOW, I MAY BECOME PRESIDENT BUT HE WILL BE KING OF OHIO FOR\nAS LONG AS THERE IS A KING. I'M OBVIOUSLY DELIGHTED TO BE\nENDORSED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS DEMONSTRATED SUCH LEADERSHIP AND\nSUCH EXTRAORDINARY ABILITY. WHAT MOVED ME THE MOST, HE'S\nGIVEN BACK TO HIS HOME TOWN. >> Reporter: YOU MAY REMEMBER\nWHAT THESE CELEBRITIES, MUSICIANS AND NOW LeBRON JAMES,\nHOW THEY HELP? THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN WILL SAY\nIT'S AN ORGANIZING TOOL. EVERYONE BEHIND ME HERE HAS\nGIVEN INFORMATION. THEY ARE LIKELY TO GET A TEXT\nMESSAGE OR E-MAIL ON ELECTION DAY OR BEFORE ELECTION DAY TO\nGET OUT THE VOTE. THAT'S WHAT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN\nIS TRYING TO DO WITH THE BIG NAMES, USING IT TO RALLY\nSUPPORT. WE'RE ALSO EXPECTING TO HEAR\nFROM LeBRON JAMES IN A COUPLE HOURS.\nNEVER ENDORSED A MAJOR POLITICAL FIGURE LIKE THIS.\nIT WILL BE FASCINATING TO HEAR WHAT HE HAS TO SAY ABOUT WHY\nHE'S DOING IT. >> SHE SEEMS LIKE SHE HAS THE\nA-TEAM OUT FOR HER. WE'LL SEE IF THAT TRANSLATES\nINTO VOTES. JEFF ZELENY, THANK YOU SO MUCH.\nDONALD TRUMP SET TO SPEAK IN MINNEAPOLIS FOR A CAMPAIGN RALLY\nTHERE MOMENTARILY. YOU SEE THE AIRPLANE HANGAR IS\nPACKED. YOU SEE THE TRUMP/PENCE SIGNS.\nALL OF THEM BATTLEGROUNDS EXCEPT FOR WHERE HE'LL BE IN MINNESOTA.\nSARA IS LIVE IN MINNEAPOLIS AND THAT'S THE QUINKY DINK ON THIS\nSUNDAY. IT HASN'T BEEN REPUBLICAN SINCE\nTHE NIXON LANDSLIDE IN 1972. SO ON THIS SUNDAY BEFORE\nELECTION DAY, WHY IS HE SPENDING TIME THERE, SARA?\n>> Reporter: WELL, BROOK, THAT'S A QUESTION THAT'S BAFFLING TO\nSOME EVEN INSIDE DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN TODAY.\nTLSZ NO DOUBT HE'LL GET A WARM WELCOME HERE.\nTHIS IS A PACKED HOUSE INSIDE, OVERFLOW CROWD OUTSIDE.\nTHAT DOESN'T CHANGE THE DYNAMICS OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA.\nIT IS A VERY BLUE STATE AND GONE FOR DEMOCRATS SINCE 1972, 1972\nIS THE LAST TIME A REPUBLICAN WON IT.\nAND PUBLIC POLLS SHOW HILLARY CLINTON WITH A COMFORTABLE LEAD\nHERE. NOW DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN\nMANAGER KELLYANNE CONWAY SAID TO REPORTERS, THEY SEE A TIGHT RACE\nHERE IN THEIR INTERNALS BUT I TALKED TO A NUMBER OF OTHER\nPEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE CAMPAIGN WHO SAY THEY HAVEN'T SEEN ANY\nINTERNAL POLLING FOR MINNESOTA. THEY HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE\nTHE CAMPAIGN IS EVEN PULLING MINNESOTA.\nTHEY BELIEVE THIS IS MORE OF AN AN EFFORT IN OPTICS, A WAY FOR\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN TO SAY, WE'RE PUSHING INTO BLUE BATTLEGROUNDS,\nNOT JUST MICHIGAN AND PENNSYLVANIA.\nIF YOU TALK TO REPUBLICAN STRATEGISTS, THEY DON'T SEE A\nCHANCE FOR DONALD TRUMP TO BREAK THROUGH HERE.\nTHEY SAY HE DOESN'T HAVE THE KIND OF GROUND OPERATION YOU\nWOULD NEED TO BE ABLE TO CAPITALIZE ON LATE MOMENTUM IN A\nPLACE LIKE MINNESOTA TILTED BLUE FOR SO LONG.\nTHAT ISN'T GOING TO STOP HIM FROM COMING HERE AND TRYING TO\nGET HIS BEST SHOT. >> WE WILL LISTEN IN LIVE.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH FROM MINNEAPOLIS.\nDONALD TRUMP'S LAST MINUTE BID IN MINNESOTA ALONG WITH HEAVY\nCAMPAIGNING IN MICHIGAN HAS A LOT OF DEMOCRATS TAKING A SECOND\nGLANCE AT THE TRADITIONAL BLUE WALL OF ELECTORAL VOTES.\nLET ME BRING IN OUR POLITICAL GUR RUE HERE TO BREAK DOWN WHAT\nEXACTLY IS GOING ON. HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THIS?\n>> THERE IS CLEARLY MORE COMPETITIVENESS, A TIGHTENING\nHAPPENING IN SOME OF THESE BLUE STATES BECAUSE YOU WOULD NOT SEE\nBARACK OBAMA AND HILLARY CLINTON TWICE AND BILL CLINTON TWICE ALL\nVISITING MICHIGAN UNLESS THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN THOUGHT THEY\nHAD TO SHORE SOMETHING UP. LET'S LOOK AT THE OVERALL\nELECTORAL MAP. YOU SEE THERE FIVE STATES IN\nYELLOW. THOSE ARE THE FIVE REMAINING\nREAL TOSS-UP BATTLEGROUND STATES.\nIF YOU ADD UP EVERY BLUE LEANING STATE AND SOLID STATE HILLARY\nCLINTON IS TWO SHY OF WHERE SHE NEEDS TO BE TO WIN THE WHITE\nHOUSE. SHE CAN WIN ANY ONE OF THOSE\nYELLOW STATES AND SHE GETS THERE.\nTHEY ARE FEELING GOOD ABOUT NEVADA, SIX ELECTORAL VOTES\nTHERE BASED ON THE EARLY VOTE. DONALD TRUMP AT 204, HE NEEDS TO\nSWEEP EVERY REMAINING BATTLEGROUND STATE AND IF HE\nISN'T ABLE TO DO THAT, THAT'S WHY YOU SEE HIM IN MINNESOTA, IN\nMICHIGAN, LOOKING FOR SOMEWHERE ELSE TO FIND VOTES SO HE'S NOT\nJUST A NO ROOM FOR ERROR, MUST SWEEP EVERY BATTLEGROUND STATE.\nTO SEE IF THERE'S OPPORTUNITY IN THE BLUE STATES AS WELL.\n>> OKAY, DAVID, THANK YOU SO MUCH.\nLET'S BROADEN THIS OUT TO HIS POINT ABOUT THESE BLUE STATES\nAND WHERE TRUMP COULD HAVE A CHANCE AND ALSO MANU IS\nREPORTING, JAY NEWTON SMALL, AUTHOR OF \"BROAD INFLUENCE\"\nWOMEN ARE CHANGING THE WAY AMERICA WORKS AND DAVID WUR\nLICH, ASSISTANT EDITOR OF THE \"WASHINGTON POST.\"\nLYNN SWEET, THE WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF OF CHICAGO SUN\nTIMES AND MANU RAJU, GREAT TO SEE YOU ON A BEAUTIFUL SUNDAY IN\nD.C. WITH YOUR REPORTING BETWEEN THE\nMOST POWERFUL REPUBLICAN IN CONGRESS AND YOUR REPUBLICAN AT\nTHE TOP OF THE TICKET HERE, IT WAS AN ALMOST MOMENT.\n>> THERE WAS AN ALMOST MOMENT. LAST MONTH WHEN HE TOLD\nREPUBLICANS IN A PRIVATE CONFERENCE CALL HE WOULD NO\nLONGER DEFEND DONALD TRUMP AND WOULD NOT CAMPAIGN WITH DONALD\nTRUMP IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE ACCESS HOLLYWOOD VIDEO.\nIT TURNS OUT HE DID CAMPAIGN WITH DONALD TRUMP TODAY IN\nWISCONSIN. OFFERED TO APPEAR AT THE\nCAMPAIGN STOP WITH DONALD TRUMP. THEY CANCELLED THE PLANS AND\nCHANGED THE SCHEDULE. THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT.\nYESTERDAY PAUL RYAN APPEARED ON STAGE WITH MIKE PENCE, TRUMP'S\nRUNNING MAKE AS THEY TRIED TO CAMPAIGN FOR RON JOHNSON, IN A\nTIGHT RACE, SURPRISINGLY TIGHT RACE.\nBUT IT GOES TO THE POINT THAT A COUPLE OF THINGS, PAUL RYAN IS\nUNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE FROM TRUMP SUPPORTERS WHO WANT HIM TO\nDO MORE EVEN WITHIN HIS OWN CONFERENCE AND HE RECOGNIZES\nTHAT. AND ALSO, THERE IS A REAL BELIEF\nTHAT THIS IS TIGHTENING, THIS RACE IS TIGHTENING AND THAT\nREPUBLICANS NEED TO COME HOME AS PAUL RYAN SAID AND THEY COULD\nWIN THIS RACE. THERE'S SOME REPUBLICANS WHO ARE\nCONCERNED IF THEY DON'T HAVE THAT MESSAGE, THEY COULD END UP\nGETTING BLAMES IF THEY DON'T DO MORE TO HELP THE TOP OF THE\nTICKET. A LOT OF DYNAMICS PLAYING OUT\nBECAUSE POLLS ARE TIGHTENING. >> YOU DON'T SEE IT AS THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN THROWING SHADE ON THE SPEAKER?\n>> I HAVE NO EVIDENCE OF THAT RIGHT NOW.\nIT SEEMS TO ME MORE OF AN EFFORT BY PAUL RYAN TO MEND FENCES\nBECAUSE HE KNOWS HIS POSITION TO NOT DEFEND OR CAMPAIGN WITH\nDONALD TRUMP GOT A LOT OF BLOW BACK.\n>> I WANT TO BRING THIS UP TO ALL OF YOU, SPEAKER RYAN WROTE\nTHE CNN OP-ED. WHERE HE DOES MENTION DONALD\nTRUMP BY NAME, GO TO -- THIS IS THE URL AND WHAT UNIFIED\nREPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT CAN GET YOU AND THEN VOTE REPUBLICAN.\nDONALD TRUMP, OUR SENATE CANDIDATES AND HOUSE CANDIDATES\nTO START TURNING THINGS AROUND. IF REPUBLICANS DO NOT TURN OUT\nAND SIT THIS ONE OUT, WE'LL OPEN THE DOOR NOT JUST TO HILLARY\nCLINTON BUT ALSO A DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS EAGER TO GIVE HER A\nBLANK CHECK. HE'S SAYING SORT OF WHAT WE'VE\nBEEN HEARING JAY FROM TRUMP AS FAR AS YOU ELECT HER,\nINVESTIGATION, DRAMA AND SCANDAL --\n>> I MEAN, THAT IS THE CASE THAT CERTAINLY REPUBLICANS HAVE MADE\nALL ALONG. SHE'S THE WORSER OF THE TWO\nOPTIONS. IF YOU LOOK AT SUPREME COURT\nNOMINATIONS AND IF YOU LOOK AT POLICY AND THESE THINGS BUT IT\nIS STILL REALLY STRIKING AND AS YOU GO INTO THE END OF THIS\nFINAL STRETCH OF THIS CAMPAIGN, THE LAST 48, 52 HOURS, THAT YOU\nSEE HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGNING -- IF YOU LOOK AT\nTHE BEGINNING OF HER RALLIES, SHE HAS THIS LAUNDRY LIST OF\nPEOPLE WHO ARE THERE SUPPORTING HER FROM THE SENATE CANDIDATES\nAND GUBERNATORIAL TO THE HOUSE CANDIDATES TO THE MAYOR AND\nSCHOOL BOARD PEOPLE AND ON AND ON.\nALL OF THESE PEOPLE ARE THERE TO GET ELECTED.\nYOU GO TO THE TRUMP RALLIES AND TRUMP YESTERDAY SAID ME ANDMY\nWIFE AND SON ERIC. AND IT'S SO STRIKING IT'S SUCH A\nNONTRADITIONAL CAMPAIGN THAT TRUMP IS RUNNING BECAUSE HE'S\nRUNNING AS AN OUTSIDER AND HAS RUN AGAINST THE ESTABLISHMENT OF\nWASHINGTON AS A WHOLE, REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT.\nTHE REALLY BIG QUESTION THERE, WHAT EFFECT THAT HAS ON THE DOWN\nBALLOT AND WHETHER HIS COAT TAILS ARE BIG ENOUGH OR\nDETRIMENT. >> WHY SAYING VOTE REPUBLICAN,\nVOTE REPUBLICAN, VOTE REPUBLICAN.\nON THE BLUE WALL, LET'S ME ASK YOU, THE FACT THAT JEFF ZELENY\nSAID YOU HAVE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TWICE IN\nMICHIGAN -- DAVID CHALIAN AND YOU HAVE BILL CLINTON IN\nMICHIGAN, THIS SHOULD BE TRADITIONALLY A LOCK FOR HER.\nWHY THEN DO YOU SEE THIS AS NERVES AMONG THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN? >> I DON'T SEE THIS AS NERVES\nAND TOMORROW YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE BOTH CLINTON AND DONALD\nTRUMP IN GRAND RAPIDS, WHICH IS AN INTERESTING PLACE, THE HOME\nOF THE GERALD FORD MUSEUM AND HOME TO WHAT I CALL THE AMWAY\nVOTE, A CONSERVATIVE SLICE OF MICHIGAN.\nTHE WHOLE TUMBLE IN THE POLLS IS DIRECTLY DUE TO THE FBI,\nDIRECTOR COMY AND HIS REOPENING THE I MAIL DECISION.\n>> THINK OF THE INDEPENDENTS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, THERE IS THE\nEVENT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AS WELL. >> I THINK SHE'S STILL IN THE\nLEAD BUT THIS NEW NEGATIVE CAMPAIGNING THAT'S GOING TO THE\nEND, THAT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN WANTED, I DON'T THINK IT'S\nANYTHING BUT THE FBI -- FBI REVELATION.\nAND AS A RESULT OF THAT, IT REOPENED MICHIGAN.\nI WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT THE VOTE THERE COULD HAVE BEEN MORE\nSOLID BECAUSE THE ISSUES ARE PLAYING TO HER, ESPECIALLY WITH\nFLINT ON THE TABLE WITH THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR IN MICHIGAN\nBUT IT ISN'T. IT WAS JUST TURNS OUT TO BE MORE\nFRAGILE THAN ANYONE HAD THOUGHT. >> IT IS MORE FRAGILE AND IT IS\nELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTE RICH. WE TALK ABOUT OHIO HAVING 18\nELECTORAL VOTES, MICHIGAN HAS 16.\nYOU CAN'T AFFORD IF YOU'RE THE DEMOCRATS TO HAVE THE BOTTOM\nFALL OUT IN A STATE YOU THOUGHT --\n>> WHAT ABOUT MINNESOTA? WHAT IS TRUMP DOING THERE?\nIT'S SINCE 1972. LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN, THAT IT'S\nGONE DEMOCRAT. >> I WAS JUST LOOKING AT THAT\nLAST POLL OF POLLS YOU SHOWED AND IT WAS EIGHT OR NINE POINTS\nIN FAVOR OF SECRETARY CLINTON. >> 11th HOUR LAST DITCH.\nROMNEY WAS IN PENNSYLVANIA AND THAT DIDN'T WORK FOR HIM --\n>> IT'S HARD TO SEE WHY THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS A BIG -- THEY\nMUST THINK THEY KNOW SOMETHING BUT IT IS HARD TO SEE WHY THEY\nTHINK THEY HAVE A SHOT AT MINNESOTA WITH THREE DAYS LEFT.\n>> IT SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF THAT IS A MESSAGE, MORE THAN ACTUAL\nREALITY, THAT THEY CAN WIN IT, TO TELL THE VOTERS AND\nSUPPORTERS, WE'RE ON OFFENSE AND WE'RE EXPANDING THE MAP.\nWE'RE NOT SHRINKING, WE'RE FIGHTING IN THESE BLUE STATES.\nBUT ONE THING I WANT TO POINT OUT, THE NBC WALL STREET JOURNAL\nPOLL TODAY HAD A CONCERNING NUMBER FOR TRUMP SUPPORTERS,\nWHITE COLLEGE EDUCATED VOTERS SUPPORTING HILLARY CLINTON MORE\nTHAN DONALD TRUMP. THOSE ARE KEY -- PARTICULARLY\nFOR REPUBLICANS, SENATORS AND PEOPLE IN KEY DOWNTICKET RACES,\nTHEY NEED THOSE VOTERS TO COME TO THE POLLS AND SUPPORT THEM\nAND TOP OF THE TICKET AS WELL. THAT'S A NATIONAL POLL, WE'LL\nSEE HOW THAT PLAYS IN THE BATTLEGROUND STATE.\n>> THAT'S A QUICK POINT. YOU KNOW, AS LONG AS TRUMP IS\nLOSING IN A HEAVY WAY, THE HISPANIC VOTE AND WHITE COLLEGE\nEDUCATED VOTERS, IT'S HARD TO SEE HIS PATH TO 270.\nIT'S JUST -- >> I THINK THAT MAY BE ONE OF\nTHE BIGGEST -- LET ME HIT PAUSZ. I WANT TO KEEP YOU AROUND.\nI'M GLAD YOU MESSAGING, BECAUSE THAT'S A BIG PARLT OF THIS, DO\nNOT FORGET, TUESDAY, ELECTION DAY.\nWE'VE BEEN LEADING UP TO THE SUPER BOWL OF POLITICS, ELECTION\nNIGHT IN AMERICA. STAY WITH CNN UNTIL THE LAST\nVOTE IS COUNTED. MOMENTS AWAY FROM DONALD TRUMP\nNOW AND ALSO FROM THE PRESIDENT, BOTH SPEAKING MOMENTARILY,\nSPRINT TO THE FINISH.

HOW DOES THIS LOOK?\n>> IF WE'RE LOOKING AT THE EARLY VOTING PATTERNS, THAT SURGE OF\nLATINO VOTES RIGHT NOW IS HAVING THAT WE HAVE TO WATCH.\nIT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE YOU THINK ABOUT WHERE THIS CAMPAIGN\nSTARTED WITH DONALD TRUMP'S SPEECH.\nANNOUNCING HIS CANDIDACY. YOU KNOW, IT STARTED WITH AN\nALIENATION OF LATINOS. I THINK IT'LL BE INTERESTING\nTHAT IT COMES FULL CIRCLE, BACK TO DONALD TRUMP'S ALIENATION OF\nLATINOS, POSSIBLY COSTING HIM BIG STATES LIKE FLORIDA.\nAND OTHER STATES LIKE NORTH CAROLINA WITH A SURGE OF LATINO\nVOTES. >> YOU AGREE IF WE CAN'T WIN\nFLORIDA, THAT'S IT? >> YES.\nHE HAS TO HAVE FLORIDA. HE HAS TO HOLD ON TO A STATE\nLIKE NORTH CAROLINA. AND THEN FIND ANOTHER STATE.\nTHAT'S WHERE HE'S HAVING TROUBLE RIGHT NOW.\n>> IN TERMS OF WHERE HILLARY CLINTON IS RIGHT NOW, HOW DO YOU\nFEEL? >> WELL, I'M FEELING PRETTY GOOD\nACTUALLY. I JUST WANT TO COMMENT ON WHAT\nKEVIN SAID. YES, LATINO VOTES ARE HAVING AN\nIMPACT IN FLORIDA BUT ALSO IN VIRGINIA, PLACES LIKE NORTH\nCAROLINA. CERTAINLY NEVADA.\nI THINK THAT IS GOING TO BE THE STORY OF 2016.\nFOR ME AS A HISPANIC WOMAN, IT IS VERY GRATIFYING THAT\nHISPANICS ARE GOING TO BE THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO BEAT\nDONALD TRUMP. I MEAN, HE SPENT THE LAST YEAR\nAND A HALF BASICALLY INSULTING, OFFENDING, DEMEANING.\nI MEAN, HE STARTED THE CAMPAIGN THAT WAY BUT HE DOUBLED DOWN AND\nTRIPLED DOWN. NEVER TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO\nAPOLOGIZE. NOW HE'S REALLY GOING TO PAY THE\nPRICE FOR IT. >> AS YOU LOOK AT IT, YOU'RE NO\nFAN OF DONALD TRUMP, BUT IF DONALD TRUMP DOES LOSE AND IT IS\nBECAUSE OF THIS LATINO TURNOUT, DOES HE ONLY HAVE HIMSELF TO\nBLAME FOR THIS? >> SURE.\nI MEAN, HE IS THE ONLY ONE TALKING ABOUT MEXICANS BEING\nRAPISTS AND THE ASSAULT YOU'VE HAD ON IMMIGRATION AS A WHOLE.\nHE IS IN MINNESOTA ATTACKING IMMIGRANTS.\n>> ESPECIALLY AFTER THE AUTOPSY OF 2012.\n>> THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WENT THROUGH A LOGICAL COACHING\nPROCESS.

ACCEPT FOR A COUPLE OF STATES.\nIOWA, HE HAS A GOOD ORGANIZATION.\nTRUMP DOESN'T HAVE AN ORGANIZATION.\nI THINK THAT IS GOING TO BE TELLING ON ELECTION DAY.\n>> I MEAN, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS INTERESTED ME, THEY\nKEEP SAYING, HE DOESN'T HAVE AN ORGANIZATION BUT THE REPUBLICAN\nPARTY HAS AN ORGANIZATION. >> RIGHT.\n>> THE ORGANIZATION WAS BUILT TO ELECT REPUBLICANS DOWN BALLOT,\nTO BRING REPUBLICAN VOTERS OUT. WHEN YOU HAVE A PRESIDENTIAL\nCAMPAIGN, YOU'RE IDENTIFYING YOUR VOTERS.\nTHEY'RE NOT ALL REPUBLICAN. SOME ARE INDEPENDENT.\nSOME ARE DEMOCRATS. YOU KNOW WHO YOUR VOTERS ARE.\nYOU GO AND GET THEM. THERE IS NO INDICATION TO ME\nTHAT THERE IS ANY SUCH OPERATION ON THE TRUMP SIDE.\nAS TO THE BIG PROBLEM, YOU KNOW, ULTIMATELY, THIS COMES DOWN TO\nMATH. IN ORDER TO WIN, YOU HAVE TO\nACHIEVE A CERTAIN NUMBER. IN A COUNTRY THAT'S BECOMING\nMORE AND MORE DIVERSE, YOU CAN'T ALIENATE YOURSELF FROM THE MOST\nDYNAMICALLY GROWING PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND EXPECT TO WIN.\nTHIS IS WHAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY CONCLUDED IN 2012.\nDONALD TRUMP PUT TOGETHER A CAMPAIGN THAT WAS DESIGNED TO\nWIN THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT.\nHE ACHIEVED THAT. IN SO DOING, HE MADE IT\nVIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO WIN A GENERAL ELECTION.\n>> IF HE DOES NOT WIN, A CANDIDATE WHO SAID EARLY ON, I\nBUILD A WINNING ORGANIZATION, SURROUND MYSELF WITH THE BEST\nPEOPLE, HASN'T BUILT A WINNING ORGANIZATION.\nIT MAY TURN OUT HE KNOWS MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE AND HAS\nBUILT -- >> I KNOW HE DADESAID THAT.\nTHE FACT IS, EVERYTHING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP IS ABOUT DONALD\nTRUMP. HE IS THE CENTER OF EVERY\nSCRIPT. HE IS THE CENTER OF EVERY\nACTIVITY. THAT'S THE WAY HE'S RUN HIS\nPRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. IT IS NOT JUST THAT OTHER\nREPUBLICANS DON'T WANT TO GO OUT AND BE SURROGATES FOR HIM.\nHE THINKS HE IS THE BEST PERSON OUT THERE AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT.\nHE DOESN'T REALLY, I THINK, BELIEVE IN THE NEED FOR AN\nORGANIZATION. HE THINKS THIS IS ALL AN\nEXERCISE IN MEDIA AND THAT HE IS THE PEST AT THAT.\nI THINK THAT IS A BIG MISCALCULATION.\n>> HOW DO YOU SEE THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN?\nDO YOU THINK WITH THIS NEW COMEY LETTER, HILLARY CLINTON HAS NOT\nTALKED ABOUT IT ON THE TRAIL TODAY.\nDO YOU THINK THAT IS WISE? EARLIER ON, FOLKS WERE SAYING\nANY TIME SHE IS TALKING ABOUT E-MAILS IS NOT A GOOD IDEA.\n>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. OBVIOUSLY, IT IS GOOD NEWS FOR\nHER AND GOOD NEWS FOR HER STAFF. GOOD NEWS FOR HUMA.\nCONSIDERING WHAT THE ALTERNATIVE COULD HAVE BEEN.\nSHE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT E-MAIL.\nSHE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE FBI OR DYSFUNCTION AT THE\nFBI. THOSE WORDS SHOULD NOT COME FROM\nHER MOUTH. WE DON'T WANT TO REMIND VOTERS\nOF THE SERVER. SHE WANTS THE END THE CAMPAIGN\nON A POSITIVE NOTE AND TALK ABOUT HER MESSAGE, STRONGER\nTOGETHER. BEING THE PRESIDENT FOR ALL\nAMERICANS. >> ALTHOUGH SHE HAS BEEN, YOU\nKNOW -- IT IS NOT ALL HIGH AND, YOU KNOW, SUNSHINE.\nIT'S BEEN CHARACTER ATTACK ON DONALD TRUMP DAY AFTER DAY.\n>> RIGHT. SINCE THE LETTER CAME OUT,\nRIGHT, NINE DAYS AGO. NOW THAT IT IS OVER AND DONE,\nSHE CAN GO BACK AND CLOSE ON A POSITIVE MESSAGE.\n>> HOW DO YOU THINK DONALD TRUMP -- DO YOU THINK THE COMEY\nLETTER MAKES A DIFFERENCE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER?\nPAUL THINKS IT IS BAKED? >> I DON'T THINK MANY AMERICANS\nARE SAYING, AM I REALLY GOING TO VOTE FOR HILLARY CLINTON OR\nDONALD TRUMP? THESE ARE THE MOST POLL R--\nPOLARIZING CANDIDATES WE'VE HAD. IF COMEY SAID THE INVESTIGATION\nWAS REOPENED TODAY, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BAD.\nI DON'T THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE THAT\nHAVEN'T MADE A DECISION ARE GOING TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT.\n>> YEAH, I THINK ON THE MARGINS, IT IS NOT GOING TO MATTER THAT\nMUCH. I THINK THE BIGGER PROBLEM THAT\nI WOULD BE WORRYING ABOUT IF I WERE INSIDE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN,\nIS OVER THE LAST WEEK, THEY WERE ABLE TO CRYSTALLIZE THEIR\nMESSAGE AS A CONTRAST MESSAGE AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON AND\nBRING HOME SOME DISAFFECTED REPUBLICANS.\nYOU BUILT THAT CLOSING MESSAGE ON THAT ARGUMENT THAT IS NOW\nESSENTIALLY GONE. WHAT HAPPENS IN THE NEXT 48\nHOURS? IS THE DISCIPLINED TRUMP WE'VE\nSEEN THE LAST 72 HOURS, IS HE GOING TO DISAPPEAR IN THE LAST\n48 HOURS? I THINK THAT'LL BE WHAT I'D BE\nWATCHING OVER THE NEXT 48 HOURS. >> IT IS, I THINK, THE MOST\nTELLING THING, AND THIS WAS HIGHLIGHTED BY THE DISCUSSION\nYOU HAD WITH JOHN KING, IS THAT IN THE LAST 48 HOURS OF THIS\nCAMPAIGN, DONALD TRUMP IS RUNNING AROUND THE COUNTRY LIKE\nWILLIE LOEHMANN, TRYING TO MAKE A SALE, DESPERATELY TRYING TO\nFIND THE PIECES HE NEEDS TO PUT THIS TOGETHER.\nAND IT IS VERY, VERY UNLIKELY THAT HE CAN DO THAT.\n>> DEATH OF A SALESMAN IS THE PRODUCTION THAT WILLIE LOEHMANN\nWAS IN. NOT A GOOD TITLE FOR THE\nCANDIDATE. DO YOU WANT TO SAY WHAT YOU\nTHINK WILL HAPPEN ON ELECTION DAY?\n>> LISTEN, I THINK IT IS GOING TO BE VERY, VERY DIFFICULT FOR\nTRUMP TO REVERSE WHAT HAS HAPPENED NOW.\nTHE REAL THING THAT I HOPE WILL HAPPEN IS I HOPE THERE WILL BE A\nLOT OF TICKET SPLITTING. I THINK THE REPUBLICAN\nCANDIDATES ARE, FOR THE MOST PART, TREMENDOUS CANDIDATES.\nI THINK THAT IT WOULD REALLY HELP US TO HAVE A REPUBLICAN\nSENATE. THAT CAN BE A BIG STORY TUESDAY\nNIGHT. >> ONE OF THE PARADOXES IS THERE\nARE A LOT OF REPUBLICANS THAT DON'T LIKE DONALD TRUMP, WOULD\nLIKE TO SEE HIM TLHUMPED SO THI IS SETTLED AND DOESN'T SPILL\nBEYOND THE ELECTION IN TERMS OF DEFINING THE PARTY.\nIF HE DOES GET THUMPED BY A BIG MARGIN, THEN YOU LOSE THE SENATE\nAND LOSE A LOT OF THE CANDIDATES.\nTHERE IS A PARADOX HERE. >> RIGHT.\n>> WE HAVE TO TAKE A BREAK.

THAT WILL LEAD TO QUESTIONS\nABOUT WHAT THE PARTY STANDS FOR AND WHO THEIR MAIN CONSTITUENTS\nARE AND WHAT DOES THE CLINTON COALITION LOOK LIKE IS IT A\nVIABLE PATH FOR DEMOCRATS. >> THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION\nIS CLEARLY YES. THE GEOGRAPHY IS FOLLOW HG\nDEMODE DEMOGRAPHY.\nTHE NBC/\"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" POLL HAD TRUMP LEADING.\nON THE OTHER HAND, AS WE'VE SEEN, HE IS FACING HISTORIC\nRESISTANCE FROM MINORITY VOTERS AND HE IS ALSO AT RISK OF\nBECOMING THE FIRST REPUBLICAN TO LOSE COLLEGE EDUCATED WHITES IN\nTHE HISTORY OF POLLING. WHICH MEANS THE RUST BELT STATES\nWHICH HAVE BEEN RELIABLY DEMOCRATIC PLACES LIKE\nWISCONSIN, PENNSYLVANIA, AND LESS OHIO AND IOWA WHERE THE\nTRUMP COALITION IS POWERFUL.

HILLARY CLINTON, 600,000 DOOR\nKNOCKS, 2 MILLION PHONE CALLS, THEY HAVE 12,000 VOLUNTEERS\nSPREAD OUT THROUGH NEW HAMPSHIRE, MAKING SURE THEIR\nSUPPORTERS COME TO THE POLLS ON TUESDAY.\nDONALD TRUMP, 1.4 MILLION DOOR KNOCKS AND 1.3 MILLION PHONE\nCALLS. IF YOU LOOK AT THE STAR POWER,\nYOU GET A SENSE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS.\nON HILLARY CLINTON SIDE, ELIZABETH WARREN FROM\nNEIGHBORING MASSACHUSETTS, MADELEINE ALBRIGHT, FORMER\nSECRETARY OF STATE AND OF COURSE BARACK OBAMA HIMSELF COMING ON\nMONDAY TO MAKE THAT CLOSING ARGUMENT.\nON THE TRUMP SIDE, WE'VE SEEN INVANKA AND MIKE PENCE WILL BE\nHERE LATER AND DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF COMING TO MAKE THE\nCLOSING ARGUMENT. YOU START TO UNDERSTAND WHY\nTHERE'S SO MUCH ACTIVITY HERE. THE CNN POLL SHOWING HILLARY\nCLINTON UP TWO POINTS, 43 TO 41%.\nLAST MONTH SHE HAD A 15-POINT LEAD.\nTHAT'S WHY THERE'S SO MUCH ACTIVITY HERE AND THIS IS COMING\nDOWN TO INDEPENDENTS. IF YOU LOOK AT THE INDEPENDENTS\nWHO VOTED IN 2012, 43% OF THOSE WHO CAST A BALLOT CAST A BALLOT\nINDEPENDENT AND BROKE FOR BARACK OBAMA.\nHILLARY CLINTON HOPING TO DO THAT AGAIN ON TUESDAY BECAUSE\nTHEY ARE LOOKING AT THE GHOST OF AL GORE.\nIF YOU REMEMBER, AL GORE LOST NEW HAMPSHIRE, HE HAD WON NEW\nHAMPSHIRE, HE WOULD HAVE WON THE WHITE HOUSE, EVEN THOUGH GEORGE\nW. BUSH WON FLORIDA. HILLARY CLINTON AND HER TEAM\nTRYING TO MAKE SURE HISTORY DOES NOT REPEAT ITSELF HERE IN THE\nGRANITE STATE ON TUESDAY, BROOKE.\n>> LOST 7,211 VOTES AND DEMOCRATS WERE IRKED HE DID NOT\nSPEND MORE TIME IN NEW HAMPSHIRE SO THEREFORE HILLARY CLINTON IS\nTHERE TODAY. ANOTHER REASON WHY HILLARY\nCLINTON IS NOW RETURNING TO NEW HAMPSHIRE IS AL GORE AND LESSONS\nLEARNED FROM THE PAST. GORE ONLY HELD ONE EVENT IN NEW\nHAMPSHIRE IN 2000, CAMPAIGNING TO BECOME PRESIDENT AND ENDED UP\nLOSING THE STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE.\nDEMOCRATS ARE HOPING THAT SAME MISTAKE WILL NOT HAUNT THEM THIS\nGO AROUND. AND WITH REGARD TO THE FORMER\nVICE PRESIDENT, HE'S SAID TO STUMP FOR HILLARY CLINTON\nTOMORROW IN COLORADO, A STATE WHERE CLINTON IS IN A CLOSE RACE\nWITH DONALD TRUMP. TO ANNA CABRERA WE GO LIVE IN\nCOLORADO. HE WAS WITH HER BEFORE IN MIAMI\nTALKING CLIMATE CHANGE AND REACHING OUT TO MILLENNIALS,\nLEARN FROM ME, EVERY VOTE MATTERS.\n>> Reporter: ABSOLUTELY. HE'LL BE HERE TOMORROW IN\nJEFFERSON COUNTY. THIS IS ONE OF THE STATE'S BELL\nWEATHER COUNTIES. TWICE VOTED FOR GEORGE W. BUSH\nBEFORE THAT. IT'S A MICROCOSM AT THE STATE AT\nLARGE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE POPULATION,\nJEFFERSON COUNTY HAS THE RENEWABLE ENERGY LABORATORY BUT\nIT'S A WESTERN, RURAL ROOTED TOWN WITH BLUE COLLAR WORKERS\nWHO TEND TO LEAN MORE CONSERVATIVE AND LARGE COLLEGE\nTOWN, YOUNG EDUCATED PEOPLE WHO TEND TO LEAN MORE TO THE LEFT\nAND MORE LIBERAL AND ALSO 15% OF THE POPULATION IN JEFFERSON\nCOUNTY THAT IS LATINO. NOW STATEWIDE ABOUT 1.5 MILLION\nVOTERS HAVE ALREADY SENT IN THEIR BALLOTS AND CAST THEIR\nVOTE, THAT'S ABOUT HALF OF ALL REGISTERED VOTERS IN THE STATE.\nWHEN WE LOOK AT THE EARLY VOTE RETURNS, WE CAN TELL YOU\nDEMOCRATS HAVE A SLIGHT EDGE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST THE\nSECRETARY OF STATE NUMBERS BUT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN\nCLOSING THE GAP. DEMOCRATS ALSO HAVE AN EDGE WHEN\nIT COMES TO TOTAL REGISTERED VOTERS IN THIS STATE.\nTHAT IS THE FIRST TIME SINCE 1984 THAT THERE ARE MORE\nREGISTERED DEMOCRATS THAN REPUBLICANS HERE IN COLORADO.\nAND YET, THE LARGEST VOTING BLOC IN COLORADO IS STILL\nUNAFFILIATED VOTERS, THOSE WHO ARE REGISTERED AS INDEPENDENTS.\nTHAT'S WHY WE'RE SEEING THIS HUGE PUSH BY -- GETTING OUT THE\nVOTE, VISITING COLORADO LAST NIGHT, HAVING HIS RALLY AT THE\nDENVER NATIONAL WESTERN COMPLEX AND THEN AL GORE COMING HERE FOR\nCLINTON TOMORROW TO TRY TO RALLY THOSE LIBERAL VOTERS AND TRY TO\nTURN OUT THE MILLENNIAL VOTE IN PARTICULAR HERE IN JEFFERSON\nCOUNTY AND BOULDER AS WELL, BROOKE.\n>> LOVE THAT SIGN. HOWDY FOLKS, WELCOME TO GOLDEN,\nCOLORADO. WE'LL LOOK FOR THAT TOMORROW.\nMEANTIME, WE'RE TAKING YOU ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY HERE.\nA BUSY AFTERNOON.

AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE\nPARTICIPATING ABOUT 12.8% IN THE EARLY VOTE HISPANICS, 13.4%.\nTWO KEY CONSTITUENCIES FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nIF WE LOOK WHAT HAPPENED IN 2008, AFRICAN-AMERICANS WERE AT\n16.1% AT THAT TIME AND HISPANICS WERE AT 10.1%.\nHOWEVER, IF YOU LOOK RIGHT HERE, EVEN THOUGH WE'RE SEEING ABOUT\n71,000 MORE AFRICAN-AMERICANS HAVE ACTUALLY CAST THEIR BALLOT\nIN 2016 THAN IN 2008. THIS SHARE OF ELECTORATE HAS\nDROPPED BY MORE THAN 3%. GOOD NEWS FOR DEMOCRATS AND\nHILLARY CLINTON IS THAT WE'RE SEEING THIS RIGHT HERE, THIS\nHISPANIC PARTICIPATION INCREASE BY ABOUT 4.3% OR 363,000 MORE\nBALLOTS. LET US GO UP THE COAST TO THE\nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA WHERE MORE THAN 2.5 MILLION PEOPLE\nHAVE ALREADY CAST THEIR BALLOTS. IF WE LOOK WHO HAS THE LEAD\nTHERE, DEMOCRATS OUTPACING REPUBLICANS BY 266,000 BALLOTS\nRETURNED. WE DIG A LITTLE DEEPER, LOOK AT\n2012, THEY ARE ABOUT ON PACE RIGHT NOW DEMOCRATS ARE, ABOUT\n14,000 MORE BALLOTS RETURNED, EVEN AS WE'RE SEEING THE OVERALL\nPARTICIPATION OF DEMOCRATS IN EARLY VOTING HAS DROPPED.\nLET US DIG INTO THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF WHOSE PARTICIPATING.\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS AT 22.4%, HISPANICS AT 1.9%.\nWE COMPARE THAT NOW TO 2012 AND THIS IS A TROUBLING SIGN FOR\nHILLARY CLINTON, WE'RE SEEING THE GET OUT THE VOTE FOR\nDEMOCRATS IN THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA.\nTHIS DROPOFF EQUATES TO 31,000 LESSOR FEWER VOTES IN 2016 THAN\nWE'VE SEEN IN 2012.

WE WON'T GET DATA BEFORE THE\nELECTION ABOUT THAT. THIS IS THE 2004 MAP.\nWE'LL START AT 2016. IN THE THE AVERAGING OF MOST\nRECENT AVERAPOLLS. SOME POLLS HAS CLINTON'S LEAD AT\nTHREE, FIVE OR TWO. WHY IS IT SIGNIFICANT?\nI'LL DROP THIS DOWN AND GO BACK IN TIME TO 12012.\nREMEMBER THE LEAD. POP THIS UP HERE.\nBACK IN 2012, ON THIS DAY, THE SUNDAY BEFORE THE ELECTION,\nPRESIDENT OBAMA LED MITT ROMNEY BY ONE POINT.\nHE WON THE ELECTION BY FOUR POINTS.\nON THIS DAY IN 2004, THE LAST TIME THE REPUBLICANS WON THE\nWHITE HOUSE, GEORGE W.

NOT ALWAYS.\nIF YOU ARE A AHEAD BY A HEALTHY MARGIN GOING IN, YOU TEND TO\nWIN. YOU SEE A STABLE RACE INTO THE\nFINAL DAYS. HERE IS ONE OF THE REASONS I SAY\nTHAT. THE POLLSTERS HAVE BEEN HAVING\nTURBULENCE IN THE DATA. THEY FEEL SETTLED NOW.\nTHIS IS THE POLL THAT CAME OUT TODAY.\nTRUMP LEADS AMONG MEN BUT CLINTON LEADS WOMEN.\nALSO, IN SOME STATES ALREADY, BASED ON EARLY VOTING, FLORIDA\nINCLUDED, THEY THINK THE ELECTORATE WILL BE MORE DIVERSE\nIN SOME STATES THAN IN 2012. HILLARY CLINTON HAD A 75 POINT\nADVANTAGE AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICANS.\n42 AMONG LATINOS. IF THE ELECTORATE IS DIVERSE,\nTRUMP'S EDGE WITH WHITES WON'T BE ENOUGH.\nIN SOME STATES THIS HELPS MORE THAN OTHERS.\nHILLARY CLINTON, LOOKING AT THE CONSTRUCT OF THE ELECTORATE, IF\nIT IS MORE DIVERSE THAN 2012, IT IS A PATH FOR A CLINTON VICTORY.\nTHERE ARE SOME THINGS IN THE DATA THAT SUPPORTS TRUMP.\nIF YOU LOOK AT THE LATINOS, WOMEN AND AFRICAN-AMERICANS\nTHTHAT IS A COALITION IF THEY TURN OUT\nIS FAVORABLE TO CLINTON. >> WE TALKED ABOUT THE EDUCATION\nGAP AMONG WHITE VOTERS. HOW DOES IT LOOK AT THE END AND\nWHY DOES IT MATTER SO MUCH? >> VERY SIGNIFICANT.\nDIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT STATES. IF YOU BRING UP THE NUMBERS,\nWHITES WITH A COLLEGE DEGREE, HILLARY CLINTON, 51% TO 41%.\nTHIS IS NBC/\"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" DATA.\nTHIS IS A CONSTITUENCY ROMNEY WON BUT LOST THE WHITE HOUSE.\nDONALD TRUMP, WOW, LOOK AT THIS LOPSIDED 2:1 LEAD.\nWHITE VOTERS WITHOUT A DEGREE. TRUMP'S PATH TO VICTORY, THERE\nIS SKEPTICISM. TRUMP IS TRYING IN MICHIGAN,\nMADE A PLAY IN MINNESOTA TODAY. THE STATE HASN'T GONE\nDEMOCRATIC -- I MEAN REPUBLICAN SINCE THE 1970s.\nIF TRUMP IS TO SUCCEED, IT IS THE WHITE, WORKING CLASS VOTERS\nIN THE RUST BELT. THE COLLEGE EDUCATED, ESPECIALLY\nWOMEN, PLAY LIVE IN THE PHILADELPHIA SUBURBS AND THE\nCLEVELAND SUBURBS, THE COLUMBUS SUBURBS, IT IS PART OF THE\nCOALITION CLINTON NEEDS TO WIN THE BATTLEGROUNDS.\n>> THE RACE FOR 270, WHAT IS THE POINT AT THIS POINT?\n>> THIS IS WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW.\nTHIS IS WHERE CNN OFFICIALLY HAS IT.\n268 TO 204. IF YOU TALK TO SMART REPUBLICANS\nOUT IN THE STATE OF NEVADA, THEY THINK THE EARLY VOTING OUT THERE\nWILL TAKE THAT STATE DEMOCRATIC. THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH TO OPUT\nHILLARY CLINTON ACROSS THE FINISH LINE.\nEVEN IF DONALD TRUMP RAN THE BOARD IN THE OTHER STATES,\nARIZONA, NORTH CAROLINA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE, EVERYONE IF HE WON\nTHE TOSS UPS, HE IS SHORT. THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN FEELS\nSTRONG THEY CAN WIN DOWN HERE AND THEY CAN WIN HERE.\nEVEN IF THEY WIN ONE OF THE TWO, IT GETS DONALD TRUMP'S MATH\nVERY, VERY COMPLICATED. WHICH IS WHY IN THE FINAL DAYS,\nKELLYANNE TOLD YOU THEY HAVE THE WIND AT THEIR BACK.\nTHEY'RE LOOKING FOR TARGETS. HE'S TRYING TO GET THE 20 IN\nPENNSYLVANIA. THE 10 OUT HERE IN MINNESOTA.\nIS THERE DATA THAT SHOWS TRUMP AHEAD IN THE STATES?\nNO. DATA THAT SHOWS IT CLOSER?\nYES. HE'S GOING INTO THE STATES IN\nTHE LAST FEW DAYS TRYING TO STEAL SOMETHING BLUE.\nHE MIGHT NEED TWO OR THREE OF THEM.\n>> STAY WITH US. I WANT TO BRING THE BAND BACK\nTOGETHER. JOINING US ALSO IS DANA BASH.\nYOU WERE JOINING US BEFORE, WEREN'T YOU?\n>> I'M ALWAYS WITH YOU. >> SHE'S LIKE THE HOLY SPIRIT.\n>> DANA, YOU SEE THE NUMBERS AND THE MAP.\n48 HOURS LEFT. HOW CONFIDENT IS THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN AT THIS POINT? >> THEY'RE CONFIDENT.\nTHEY'RE CAUTIOUSLY CONFIDENT, I WOULD SAY.\nPRIVATELY, THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND REPUBLICANS WHO ARE LOOKING\nAT THE NUMBERS, WHO ARE LOOKING AT THEIR OWN DATA MODELING MOST\nIMPORTANTLY, SAY THEY WISH THEY HAD ANOTHER WEEK.\nTHE WIND HAD BEEN AT DONALD TRUMP'S BACK.\nTHEY FELT THAT HAYIF THEY HAD ANOTHER WEEK, MAYBE TWO, IT\nCOULD HAVE BEEN DOABLE IN THE KEY BLUE STATES, TO TURN THEM\nRED. >> THE REPUBLICANS SAY -- THE\nTRUMP PEOPLE WILL SAY IN ALL THESE RACES, IT IS WITHIN THE\nMARGINO OF ERROR. THAT'S WHY AS JOHN WAS POINTING\nOUT, THEY'RE GOING TO ALL THE STATES.\nTHEY HAVE TO. IF THERE IS A SHOT AT IT, THEY\nHAVE TO TAKE IT. INTERNALLY, THE CLINTON PEOPLE,\nIN SOME OF THE STATES, SAY DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.\nWE'RE AHEAD IN THESE STATES. BUT THEY WANT TO BE SURE.\nTHEY WANT TO BE SURE. ALL THEY NEED TO GET TO IS 270.\nTHEY DON'T CARE ABOUT ANYTHING ABOVE THAT.\n>> IN YOUR EXPERIENCE, THE THREE I LOOK AT THE MOST, NEW\nHAMPSHIRE, MICHIGAN, PENNSYLVANIA.\nNO EARLY VOTING. >> RIGHT.\n>> WE KNOW THE CAMPAIGN HAS DONE A GOOD JOB IN THE STATES WITH\nEARLY VOTING. DONALD TRUMP HAS GOOD SUPPORT IN\nTHOSE STATES. THE STATES WHERE IT'LL BE\nSETTLED ON GAME DAY. >> YES.\nLOOK, I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THEY'RE GOING TO\nSURE UP THE STATES. THERE IS NO EARLY VOTING THERE.\nDEMOCRATS TEND TO BENEFIT FROM EARLY VOTING.\nWE SHOULD KEEP IN MIND THAT NEW HAMPSHIRE MAY BE ESSENTIALLY\nDONALD TRUMP BUT IT IS A SMALL PRIZE.\nDOESN'T SOLVE HIS BIG PROBLEM. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT THING THAT\nHAPPENED IN THE PAST FEW DAYS IS THE EARLY VOTE OUT OF FLORIDA.\n>> YEAH. >> DEFINITELY.\n>> IF HE CAN'T WIN THOSE 29 VOTES, I HONESTLY DON'T SEE A\nVIABLE PATH FOR HIM. >> HE DOESN'T WIN FLORIDA,\nTHAT'S IT? >> I AGREE.\n>> 29. YOU HAVE TO DO MICHIGAN,\nMINNESOTA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE, THAT'S 30.\nYOU'RE ASKING TOO MUCH. >> WE'VE SAID THIS MANY, MANY\nTIMES. IT IS WORTH SAYING ONE MORE\nTIME. THE FACT IS, WE ARE BECOMING A\nMORE DIVERSE COUNTRY. EACH ELECTION, THE REPUBLICAN\nPARTY WAS RIGHT AFTER 2012 WHEN THEY SAID WE NEED TO HAVE AN\nOUTREACH TO HISPANIC AMERICANS. THEY WENT THE OTHER WAY IN THIS\nDIRECTION. DONALD TRUMP COULD PAY A BIG\nPRICE FOR THAT. >> I WAS GOING TO SAY, TO YOUR\nPOINT ABOUT THE EARLY VOTE IN FLORIDA, A BIG REASON DEMOCRATS\nARE HEARTENED BY THAT IS BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH OF A LATINO\nVOTE. THE FACT IS, IT'S GOTTEN EVEN\nBIGGER IN FLORIDA. AND I THINK WHAT IS SORT OF RICH\nOR IRONIC OR, YOU PICK HOW YOU WANT TO DESCRIBE IT, THE FACT\nTHAT HILLARY CLINTON MIGHT REALLY WIN A STATE LIKE FLORIDA,\nMAYBE SOME OTHERS, PROBABLY NEVADA, WITH THE LATINO VOTE,\nGIVEN WHERE THIS CAMPAIGN STARTED, WITH DONALD TRUMP'S\nCAMPAIGN STARTED, IT IS IRONIC. >> THE THING I THINK IS MOST --\nALMOST ASTONISHING IS THERE IS PRIVATELY A GENUINE BELIEF AMONG\nFOLKS ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE THAT SHE COULD MAKE A PUSH IN\nARIZONA AT HIM BECAUSE OF THE AGGRESSIVE EARLY VOTING AMONG\nHISPANIC VOTERS. >> HISPANIC VOTERS ARE NOT\nVOTING ON THE E-MAIL ISSUE. WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT\nALL NIGHT. THEY'RE VOTING ON THE WALL.\nTHEY'RE VOTING ON IMMIGRATION. SHE'S GOING TO -- IF SHE WERE TO\nWIN FLORIDA, IT WOULD BE A VERY DIFFERENT COALITION FROM AN\nOBAMA COALITION. THAT'S WHAT WE MAY SEE FORMING\nIN THIS ELECTION. >> I THINK IT IS TIME THE TALK\nABOUT THE HILLARY CLINTON COALITION.\n>> RIGHT. >> IT IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT\nCONFIGURATION. >> RIGHT.\n>> I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS REMARKABLE IS HOW\nWE'VE BEEN HEARING THIS PROMISE, THESE RUMBLINGS.\nSOMEDAY, THE LATINOS ARE GOING TO -- I THINK IT IS ACTUALLY\nHAPPENING AND IT IS GOING TO SHOCK DEMOCRATS AS MUCH AS\nREPUBLICANS, THAT THIS IS HAPPENING.\n>> I THINK WE NEED TO PAUSE. INSTEAD OF LUMPING ALL HISPANICS\nTO THE HILLARY CLINTON POT. THE INCREASE, 5% OF LATINOS IS\nIN FLORIDA. WHEN THE POLL WAS PUBLISHED THAT\nTRUMP WAS LEADING IN FLORIDA, THERE WAS A SUBSHR LINE, CUBANS\nRETURN TO TRUMP. THERE WAS A 20 POINT SHIFT OF\nCUBANS BACK TO TRUMP BECAUSE OBAMA AT NO TIME DEFEND THE\nEMBARGO. I THINK CUBANS HAVE COME BACK TO\nTRUMP. >> YOU'RE LIVING IN THE PAST.\n>> IF IT'S TRUE, THERE'S NOT AS MANY ANYMORE.\n>> THEY'RE OLDER. >> THE GROWTH HAS BEEN PUERTO\nRICANS AND MEXICANS IN CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICANS, TOO.\nIT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO TRUMP IF THAT HAPPENS.\nESPECIALLY, YOU START AT TAMPA AND COME ACROSS TO ORLANDO, THE\nGROWTH UP THERE HAS NOT BEEN -- >> YOU'RE SAYING --\n>> CUBA IS WAY MORE COMPLICATED. THERE IS THE 1959 GENERATION\nTHAT ESCAPED CASTRO'S COMMUNISM. VERY CONSERVATIVE.\nTHEN THOSE IN THE EARLY '80s, PRETTY REPUBLICAN.\nTHEN THE NEXT GENERATION IS PROGRESSIVE.\nTRUMP HAD A HICCUP, WHEN THERE WAS PUBLISHED ACCOUNTS HE HAD\nPERHAPS EXTENDED BUSINESS INTERESTS IN CUBA OR FORMING A\nBUSINESS, AND THAT COULD HAVE VIOLATED THE EM BABARGO ITSELF.\nTHE LATINO VOTE IN SOUTH FLORIDA IS SETTING ALL KINDS OF RECORDS.\nTHEY'RE NOT TURNING OUT FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nIN FACT, STEVE SHALE, WHO RAN THE STATE FOR DAVID AXELROD LAST\nTIME, SAID 73% OF SPANISHS WERE LOW PROPENSITY VOTERS.\nWE'RE HIGH PROPENSITY.

WE SAW A DROP OFF IN THE\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE IN REGARDS TO BALLOTS BEING DROPPED OFF.\nWHEN WE LOOK AT THE PERCENTAGES RIGHT NOW, 24% MORE FOR THE\nWHITE VOTE. NEGATIVE 5% IN THE\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN PARTICIPATION IN THE EARLY VOTE IN NORTH\nCAROLINA.

IT WASN'T IN AN AREA THAT\nNORMALLY HAS HIGH TRANSITION. THE POLLS ARE SUPPOSED TO CLOSE\nAT 7:00.

WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT THERE?\n>> WELL, HE IS TALKING ABOUT IN CLARK COUNTY, NOW, TALKING ABOUT\nPOLLING LOCATION RIGHT OUTSIDE OF LAS VEGAS THAT WAS HELD OPEN\nLATE BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE IN LINE AND COULDN'T VOTE.\nON FRIDAY ALONE, CLARK COUNTY SAW AN INCREASE, ANDERSON, OF\n57,000 PEOPLE ACTUALLY CAST BALLOTS.\nTHAT IS THE HIGHEST EVER FOR CLARK COUNTY.\nLET'S DIG A LITTLE INTO THE NEVADA NUMBERS.\nABOUT 7.7 MILLION PEOPLE CAST -- OR 770,000 PEOPLE CAST EARLY\nBALLOTS IN THE STATE OF NEVADA. IF WE DIG IN A BIT AND LOOK AT\nSTATEWIDE, THAT'S A BIT OF AN INCREASE FROM WHAT WE SAW, ABOUT\n9% ACROSS THE STATE. CLARK COUNTY, THIS IS AN\nIMPORTANT NUMBER, IT WAS AN 8% INCREASE.\nCLARK COUNTY RIGHT NOW, IT IS 30% HISPANIC.\nHISPANICS, OF COURSE, TEND TO VOTE DEMOCRAT.\nIN FACT, IN THE STATE OF NEVADA ALONE, BARACK OKLABAMA WON 70%\nTHE VOTE. >> JOINING US NOW IS NIA MALIK\nHENDERSON. YOU HEAR THE NEVADA REPUBLICAN\nTALKING ABOUT THIS AS IF IT IS A CONSPIRACY.\nPEOPLE WERE IN LINE TO VOTE. SO THEY KEPT IT OPEN.\n>> YOU HOPE THE FOLKS IN THE AUDIENCE ALREADY CAST THEIR\nBALLOTS, TOO. YOU HAVE ALL THIS ORGANIZATION\nOF IT, HAS GONE ON BY THE DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGNS IN STATES\nLIKE NEVADA, IN STATES LIKE FLORIDA.\nWE ARE SEEING THIS LATINO SURGE. IT WAS RUMORED --\n>> THE POINT IS IF ANYBODY IS IN LINE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO\nVOTE, THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO VOTE.\n>> RIGHT, RIGHT. FROM THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, THEY\nHAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS RIGGED ELECTION FOR DAYS AND\nDAYS. THE ASSUMPTION HAS ALWAYS BEEN,\nIT WILL BE RIGGED BY CERTAIN PEOPLE.\n>> TO USE THAT AS AN EXAMPLE OF RIGGING IS FACTUALLY INCORRECT.\n>> YEAH. >> THE \"CERTAIN PEOPLE,\" CALL\nTHEM FELL OW AMERICANS, NEIGHBORS.\n>> THANK YOU. >> THERE WILL BE NEIGHBORHOODS\nIN THE UNITED STATES, PRECINCTS IN THE UNITED STATES ON TUESDAY\nNIGHT WHERE THERE ARE -- THAT IS A TRUMP PRECINCT, THAT IS AN\nOVERWHELMINGLY TRUMP AREA. THERE WILL BE PEOPLE IN LINE AND\nTHE POLL CLOSING WITH COME. THEY BETTER STAND THERE AND\nBRING THEM WATER. IF IT TAKES UNTIL SUN UP, LET\nTHEM VOTE. IT SHOULD BE EASIER FOR PEOPLE\nTO VOTE, NUMBER ONE. A REPUBLICAN PARTY THAT IS IN A\nDITCH WHEN IT COMES TO HISPANIC AND LATINO AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nAND ASIAN VOTERS. THEY VOTE NOW AGAINST THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY. THE CHAIRMAN, I HOPE HE WAS\nHAVING A BAD NIGHT. THESE PERSON PEOPLE ARE\nAMERICANS. WHEN PEOPLE TALK LIKE THIS AND\nTHE LATINOS VOTE FOR THE OTHER GUYS, YOU WONDER WHY IS THIS\nHAPPENING. GUESS.\n>> IT'S BEEN THE STORY OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.\nTHIS RHETORIC -- >> CAN I MAKE AN OBSERVATION?\nI RE-READ THE AUTOPSY REPORT THAT WAS COMMISSIONED UNTIL THE\nAFTERMATH OF THE ROMNEY LOSS. IT WAS PUBLISHED IN 2013.\nTHERE IS A LINE THAT STANDS OUT. IF HISPANIC AMERICANS PERCEIVE A\nGOP NOMINEE DOES NOT WANT THEM IN THE COUNTRY, THEY WON'T PAY\nATTENTION TO THE NEXT SENTENCE. >> YUP.\n>> IT IS A LESSON THAT HASN'T BEEN LEARNED.\n>> WE'RE READING INTO THIS SAYING IT IS A KNOCK ON HISPANIC\nVOTING. HE SAID THIS STAYED OPEN AND\nOTHERS CLOSED. IF YOU'RE IN LINE AT THE\nAPPROPRIATE TIME, YOU SHOULD STAY OPEN.\nBY THE WAY, WE'VE GOT TO POINT OUT, DEMOCRATS ARE PLAYING THE\nSAME GAME. WHEN THEY SAY REPUBLICAN\nATTORNEY GENERALS ARE TRYING TO SUPPRESS THE VOTE.\nBOTH CAMPAIGNS ARE ON EDGE. THIS IS A CRUCIAL TIME.\n>> I'M MAKING THE OBSERVATION THAT DONALD TRUMP, TO ME --\n>> REPEATED WHAT THE CHAIRMAN SAID AND SAID IT WAS RIGGED.\n>> NEVER READ THE AUTOPSY REPORT.\n>> DEMOCRATS ARE DECRYING EFFORTS TO SUPPRESS THE VOTE AND\nTHE REPUBLICANS ARE ENCOURAGING. IT IS NOT THE SAME.\nTHEY'RE BOTH TALKING ABOUT VOTING SUPPRESS.\n>> FIGHTING VOTER ID IS SUPPRESSION.\n>> EXACTLY. >> ONE OF THE THINGS I DON'T\nTHINK WE HAVE TALKED ENOUGH ABOUT IS THERE IS A FEROCIOUS\nFIGHT IN THE COURTS RIGHT NOW. UNFORTUNATELY, IT IS AGAINST\nREPUBLICAN ATTORNEYS GENERAL AND REPUBLICAN LEGISLATURES THAT\nSEEMED TO ALMOST SURGICALLY DESIGN NEW RULES AND\nRESTRICTIONS, THAT OFFEND THE JUDGES.\nI'M NOT TALKING ABOUT PARTISAN DEMOCRATS.\nIT IS JUDGES SAYING THERE SEEMS TO BE NO LOGICAL EXPLANATION FOR\nSOME OF THE NEW VOTING RULES. EXCEPT TO GO AFTER BLACK VOTERS.\nTHAT'S NOT ME BUT THE JUDGES. WE NEED TO APPLAUD A LOT OF\nYOUNG LAWYERS FIGHTING THE FIGHT IN THE COURTS AND WINNING THE\nFIGHTS IN THE COURT, TO TRY TO KEEP THESE BAD LAWS AT BAY.\n>> MY POINT IS WE SEE THE LEFT USE -- VOTER ID IS A GOOD\nEXAMPLE. THEY SAY THIS IS THE REASON\nTHERE IS LOW BLACK TURNOUT. IN 2012 IN STATES THAT HAD VOTER\nID, BLACK TURNOUT WAS HIGHER, WHICH NEGATES THE ARGUMENT THAT\nBLACK ISN'T TURNING OUT BECAUSE OF THE ID.\nYOU PLAY THE SAME GAME. >> WHY WAS IT UP DESPITE THAT?\n>> WE FOUGHT BACK. >> WE USE THAT --\n>> WE FOUGHT BACK. >> USED IT AS A RALLYING POINT.\nDON'T MAKE THAT -- >> I'LL LET YOU FINISH.\nTHERE ARE HEROS FROM 2012 LIKE BEN JELL ALOUS AND OTHERS WHO W\nDON'T TALK ABOUT ANYMORE. BUT THEY PUT AN EXTRA 1 MILLION\nBLACK VOTERS IN THE BOOTHS JUST TO SAY, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO STOP\nUS. THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT WASN'T\nINTENTION -- THE INTENTION WASN'T TO STOP US.\n>> CAN WE TALK ABOUT -- GO AHEAD.\n>> THIS GOES TO THE POINT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE ALL YEAR.\nWHERE WE HAVE DISAGREED IS THAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S POLITICAL\nFORMULA, FROM THE FOUNDING, IS TO SEPARATE PEOPLE BY RACE AND\nTHEN USE THAT AS THE RACIAL FUEL TO PUSH THEIR AGENDA.\nTHAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE MISSING HERE.\n>> IT IS ABOUT JUSTICE. >> I THINK IT IS ABOUT EQUAL\nOPPORTUNITY TO VOTE. I THINK IT IS ABOUT --\n>> WHICH IS COLORLESS. >> IT SHOULD BE.\nI WISH YOU'D LET YOUR PARTY KNOW THAT.\nTHEY KEEP DESIGNING THESE LAWS THAT EVEN JUDGES SAY ARE JUST\nDESIGNED TO SUPPRESS THE BLACK VOTE.\n>> WHAT DOES CERTAIN GROUPS MEAN, IN YOUR OPINION?\n>> I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HE WAS SAYING.\nIF HE IS TRYING TO USE THIS AS A RACIAL THING, OF COURSE I'D\nCONDEMN THAT. WHAT I'M SUGGESTING TO YOU IS\nTHE FACT THAT HE COULD MEAN UNION MEMBERS FOR ALL I KNOW.\nHE COULD MEAN A THOUSAND DIFFERENT THINGS.\nI HONESTLY DON'T KNOW.

DAVID GREGORY IS AT THE MAGIC\nWALL TO WALK US THROUGH THE SCENARIOS.\nYOU HAVE ARRIVED. >> I WILL NOT TAKE MORE THAN 10\nOR 15 MINUTES. WATCH CLOSELY.\nTHE BIG THING TO TALK ABOUT HERE IS ONE OF THE TWO ROADS.\nIF WE LOOK AT THE NUMBERS, WE UNDERSTAND HILLARY CLINTON IS IN\nA BETTER POSITION. SHE IS AT 268.\nSHE IS CLOSE TO 270. IF YOU ARE CLINTON AND -- WE'LL\nJUST -- DON'T WORRY. IF YOU ARE CLINTON, YOU HAVE A\nWAY TO CLOSE THIS DOWN THAT IS RATHER EASY.\nYOU CAN TAKE NEVADA, YOU'RE DONE.\nYOU EXPECT HIGH TURNOUT AMONG LATINOS AROUND THE COUNTRY BASED\nON EARLY VOTING NUMBERS. THAT GETS HER THERE.\nSHE COULD DEAL WITH FLORIDA AND NORTH CAROLINA AND NEW\nHAMPSHIRE. THAT PUTS HER FARTHER OVER THE\nTOP WITH A BIGGER VICTORY. THE DIFFERENCE IS WE HAVE A MORE\nDIFFICULT PATH FOR DONALD TRUMP FOR THE FINAL CAMPAIGN STOPS.\nYOU HAVE TO GIVE HIM ALL OF THE BATTLEGROUND STATES.\nHE HAS TO FLIP NEVADA AND HE HAS TO WIN FLORIDA AND NORTH\nCAROLINA. AND NEW HAMPSHIRE, HE IS AT 269.\nHE WOULD HAVE TO GO WHERE HE IS GOING IN A STATE LIKE MICHIGAN.\nIT SEEMS DIFFICULT FOR HIM OR HE HAS TO COME OVER HERE AND WIN\nPENNSYLVANIA TO GET OVER 270. AN EASIER PATH FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON AT THIS POINT. ALSO RELYING ON HIGHER NON-WHITE\nTURNOUT. WHEREAS TRUMP HAS TO TURN THE\nTABLE. THAT IS A DAY AWAY AND THAT IS\nDAUNTING. >> DAVID, NICELY DONE.\n>> YOU HANDLED THE GREMLINS OF THE WALL VERY WELL.\n>> THERE ARE SERIOUS ANALYSTS WHO SAID NEVADA IS ALREADY\nHILLARY CLINTON. >> EVEN WITH THE POLL LAST WEEK?\n>> THE ACTUAL PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME OUT.\nIN NEVADA, 70% ROUGHLY IS EARLY. THE LATINO TURNOUT IS OFF THE\nCHART. IF HILLARY CLINTON WINS THE\nELECTION, THE DEFINING IMAGE IS THE LINE OUTSIDE THE MEXICAN\nGROCERY STORE. THE LAST NIGHT OF EARLY VOTING.\nTHE LINE THAT STRETCHED AND NEVER ENDED.\n1,000 PEOPLE IN LINE. >> THE ONE THAT DONALD TRUMP\nSAID WAS EVIDENCE OF A RIGGED SYSTEM WHERE WE KNOW YOU CAN\nKEEP THE POLLS OPEN IF IT IS A LONG LINE.\n>> THE OTHER BIGGEST THING THAT DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN NERVOUS\nABOUT POLLING AND THE OTHER THING IS WHAT HAPPENED IN\nFLORIDA. THE HISPANIC, OVER 900,000\nHISPANICS VOTED AND OVER ONE-THIRD OF THEM DID NOT VOTE\nIN 2012. >> SO PEOPLE CAN SEE THE EARLY\nVOTING FOR THE LATINO POPULATION THAT RON IS TALKING ABOUT.\n>> LOOK, YOU HAVE A PLACE LIKE NORTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA WHICH\nWE DON'T FOCUS ON. LATINOS ARE A THUMB ON THE\nSCALE. IT IS GROWING QUICKLY IN THE\nSOUTHEAST. IN FLORIDA, THE NUMBERS I SEE\nARE BIGGER THAN THAT. OVER 900,000 HISPANICS VOTING.\nIN THE ANALYSIS, OVER ONE-THIRD OF THEM DID NOT VOTE IN 2012.\nTHAT IS AN INCREDIBLE NUMBER. WHITE TURNOUT IN 2012, A QUARTER\nOF THEM DID NOT VOTE IN 2012. HE WILL HAVE TO REALLY MAX OUT\nON WHITE VOTERS. AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN FLORIDA DID\nFINALLY VOTE IN LARGE NUMBERS. >> HIGH INCREASE OF LATINO\nVOTERS IN NORTH CAROLINA. >> IF DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T TAKE\nBAD NEWS WELL AND FOR EXAMPLE, IN NEVADA, WHEN YOU HAD THE\nREPORTS ABOUT THE TURN OUT IN CLARK COUNTY, HE SAID THE SYSTEM\nIS RIGGED AND SAID DEMOCRATS WERE PUTTING THEIR THUMBS ON THE\nSCALE. THE OTHER OPEN QUESTION IS HOW\nHE CONTINUES TO DEAL WITH THE NEWS WITH THE FBI INVESTIGATION\nIS OVER AND DONE WITH. THE NEW YORK TIMES HAD A GREAT\nSTORY OVER THE WEEKEND THAT BASICALLY SAID THAT STORY LINE\nOF CLINTON POTENTIALLY IN LEGAL TROUBLE WAS THE ONLY THING\nTETHERING HIM. THAT MESSAGE IS GONE.\nWHERE DOES HE GO NOW? >> THERE IS NO QUESTION.\nALL OF YOU HAVE IT RIGHT THIS WAS BAD FOR CLINTON.\nTHIS WHOLE THING IS BAD FOR CLINTON.\nTHE BIGGEST NEGATIVE. THE LAST MOMENT, YOU HAVE A\nSNAPSHOT OF THEM AND WHO THEY ARE UNDER THIS GREAT STRESS.\nTRUMP IS NOT HELPING HIMSELF. ERROL LOUIS, DONALD TRUMP IS IN\nFLORIDA IN THE MORNING. RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA IN THE\nAFTERNOON. PENNSYLVANIA.\nTHEN NEW HAMPSHIRE. TEN FINISHING IN GRAND RAPIDS,\nMICHIGAN. HE IS GOING WITH THE THEORY OF\nTHE CASE I NEED A LANDSLIDE. >> THERE'S PARTLY THAT BECAUSE\nWE HAVE THAT WITH THE MAGIC WALL.\nHE HAS TO FLIP NORMALLY DEMOCRAT STATES.\nTHESE ARE STATES THAT DON'T HAVE EARLY VOTING.\nWHATEVER THEY GET, THEY HAVE TO DO IT AT THE END.\nTO A CERTAIN EXTENT, IT IS NOT A HAIL MARY PASS.\nLOADING THEM UP AT THE END AND OVER THE WEEKEND, STOPS IN\nMINNEAPOLIS WHERE THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE POLLING.\nTHE LAST REPUBLICAN THEY VOTED FOR WAS NIXON.\nTHAT WAS A SIGN OF DESPERATION. >> IF YOU GO SOME PLACE, GO SOME\nPLACE WITH A HIGHER NUMBER OF WHITE COLLEGE VOTERS.\n>> SOMETHING BIG IS HAPPENING. WE ARE ACCELERATING FUNDAMENTAL\nCHANGE IN THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE AND BALANCE OF POWER.\nTHE POPULAR VOTE FIVE OF SIX TIMES.\nTHEY HAVE DONE BETTER IN THE RUSTBELT THAN THE SUNBELT.\nOHIO, MICHIGAN, WISCONSIN, PENNSYLVANIA AND IOWA IS HIGHER\nTHAN THE AVERAGE SHARE OF THE VOTE THAN ANY OF THE SUN OR\nSWING STATES. YOU ARE SEEING A REVERSAL\nACCELERATED. DONALD TRUMP ACCORDING TO THE\nPOLL YESTERDAY IS WINNING NON-COLLEGE WHITE VOTERS.\nTHAT IS ALLOWING HIM TO BATTER AT THE DOORS IN OHIO AND IOWA\nAND MICHIGAN. NOT SO MUCH WISCONSIN, BUT THOSE\nTHREE. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE LARGE\nLATINO TURNOUT WITH LARGE COLLEGE WHITES IS MAKING CLINTON\nMOVE. AND ARIZONA IS IN THERE AS WELL.\nYOU ARE SEEING A DECADE BEING CONDENSED INTO ONE ELECTION\nCY CYCLE.\n>> DAVID, YOU CAN TELL US WHAT THIS REVEALS.\nSHE IS GOING TO PENNSYLVANIA AND MICHIGAN AND PHILLY WHERE\nSPRINGSTEEN AND BON JOVI. >> AND THE QUESTION IS WHETHER\nYOU ARE A BON JOVI PERSON OR A SPRINGSTEEN PERSON.\n>> HE IS VERY HANDSOME. I WILL ADMIT.\n>> THERE ARE A COUPLE OF FUNDAMENTAL THINGS.\nTHERE IS NO EARLY VOTING IN PENNSYLVANIA.\nTHEY WANT TO DRIVE ENTHUSIASM TO GET THEIR BASE OUT.\nNON WHITE VOTERS IN PENNSYLVANIA.\nAND IN MICHIGAN AS WELL. THE FACT THEY DID NOT PAY\nATTENTION TO MICHIGAN UNTIL NOW, YOU TAKE FOR GRANTED THAT THE\n50% OF THE VOTERS ARE COLLEGE WHITE VOTERS.\nPART OF THE SHIFT THAT RON IS TALKING ABOUT IS INTERESTING.\nTHAT IS SHE HAS BENEFITTED FROM SOMETHING UNUSUAL.\nTHAT IS WHITE VOTERS WITH COLLEGE DEGREES ARE TRENDING\nTOWARD HILLARY CLINTON. SHE MAY WIN THEM BY TEN POINTS\nWHEN EVEN OBAMA WHO CAME CLOSE LOST THEM.\nWHETHER THAT IS A PART OF THE DEMOCRATIC COALITION IS AN OPEN\nQUESTION. IF MARCO RUBIO WERE IN THE RACE,\nI'M NOT SO SURE. >> THIS IS AN INSULAR PART OF\nTHE WHITE AMERICA. >> GO AHEAD.\n>> WE CAN TALK ABOUT OHIO AGAIN. IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS PULLING\nAHEAD IN OHIO AND \"THE COLUMBUS DISPATCH\" SHOWED IT A DEAD HEAT.\nTHEY ARE TIED RIGHT NOW. THERE IS ROOM.\n>> IT WAS DEAD EVEN ON ELECTION DAY IN 2012.\nTURNOUT MADE IT BIG FOR OBAMA. >> ABSOLUTELY.\n>> WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WILL HAPPEN TOMORROW.\nPANEL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> ERROL, BON JOVI OR\nSPRINGSTEEN? >> BON JOVI.\n>> I WAS A RAP AND HIP-HOP GUY. >> ALL RIGHT.\nPLEASE STAY WITH CNN ALL DAY WITH EMCEE GREGORY AND THE GANG.\nIT WILL BE COMPLETE COME FOR ELECTION DAY.\nNO ONE WILL COVER THE RACE ALL", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1478518754321.1478514789188.54352946-35bf-4e78-914a-37b949018ed4.segment5.thumb.jpg", "channel": "202"}, {"start": 0, "length": 300938.0, "end": 300938, "date": 1478520186616, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1478522742902.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1478520183420-f347ba80-93fd-4af5-9f2a-1c65f5c971d6-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=0.00,300.94", "text": "LATINO POPULATION IN FLORIDA AND\nIT'S UP OVER 100% FROM THE LAST CYCLE AND A BIG QUESTION COMES\nDOWN TO THAT CUBAN VOTE, ESPECIALLY DOWN THERE IN SOUTH\nFLORIDA AND WHICH WAY THEY GO AND WHY.\nWHAT'S YOUR FEEL ON THE GROUND? >> HEY, GOOD MORNING, CHRIS.\nEARLY VOTING ENDED JUST YESTERDAY.\nTHERE WERE LINES ALL ACROSS CUBAN NEIGHBORHOODS HERE IN\nSOUTH FLORIDA.

WE SEE SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT AMONG\nLATINOS FOR DONALD TRUMP. BUT BACK TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS,\nSENL THE DEMOCRAT BEING PARTY HAS TAKEN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nVOTE FOR GRANTED.

BUT AS OF THE END OF THE WEEK,\nFLORIDA HAD SEEN RECORD TURNOUT AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICANS FOR\nEARLY VOTING. THE SOULS TO THE POLLS SUNDAY\nALONE AND THE MONDAY THAT FOLLOWED ENABLED\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS TO CATCH UP WITH THEIR 2012 NUMBERS IN THE\nSTATE OF FLORIDA. >> BUT THEY LITERALLY HAD TO GO\nINTO THE COMMUNITY AND USE TRANSPORTATION AND GET PULL\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS AND BEG THEM TO COME TO THE POLLS FOR HER.\nSO YOU'RE RIGHT, AFTER SOULS TO THE POLLS, THEY PROVIDED\nTRANSPORTATI AND SUPPORT, THEN TO YOU SEE A SURGE.\n>> THAT'S HOW IT WORKS EVERY TIME.\nAND NOW -- >> BUT THEY HAD TO DO THAT.\n>> THAT'S WHAT THEY DID WITH OBAMA.\nTHAT'S WHAT TO YOU WITH EVERY ELECTION.\nSOULS TO THE POLLS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT --\n>> YOU DRIVE PEOPLE TO THE POLLS AND THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU SEE\nA SURGE. >> NO THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT\nWORKS.

AND WE STAU TRANSLATE INTO\nPOLICY. HE DID MORE FOR HIV AND AIDS IN\nAFRICA THAN ANY OTHER PRESIDENT IN U.S. HISTORY.\nI NEVER SAW A GEORGE BUSH OR ANY HE OTHER PRESIDENT FOR THAT\nMATTER SIT DOWN AND SAY YOUR LIVES ARE TERRIBLE, YOU LIVE IN\nSQUALLER, YOUR EDUCATION IS HORRIBLE.\nEVERYTHING ABOUT YOUR LIFE IS JUST DEPLORABLE.\nTHAT'S WHAT WE'VE SEEN FROM DONALD TRUMP AND I THINK IT\nMAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT -- I THINK IT HAS MADE --\n>> DEPLORABLE. >> I WASN'T QUOTING HIM\nVERBATIM. DONALD TRUMP HAS PORTRAYED A\nVISION OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN LIFE THAT IS JUST NOT TRUE.\nIF WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT PEOPLE WHOSE LIVES ARE A MESS, IT'S NOT\nJUST AFRICAN-AMERICANS WHO LIVER IN LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS.\nIT IS PEOPLE, WHITE PEOPLE, WHO LIVE IN RURAL NEIGHBORHOODS.\nIT IS AMERICANS WHO HAVE NOT BEEN PREPARED FOR A 21st CENTURY\nWORKFORCE WHO HAVE LOST JOBS, TO IN THE SEE THE AMERICAN DREAM AS\nBEING PLAUSIBLE FOR THEM. AND DONALD TRUMP FORGETS THAT\nALL OF US AS A NATION. >> I'LL LET AMAROSA TO RESPOND.\n>> DONALD TRUMP IS THE ONLY ONE WHO WILL HELP TURN AROUND\nINNERITIES WITH AFRICAN-AMERICANS BECAUSE WHEN\nSHE SAYS SHE WILL CONTINUE POLICIES THAT PURCHASE OF THE\nSAME OF OBAMA AND WE SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF\nCHICAGO, IN MY OWN HOMETOWN OF YOUNGSTOWN, IN SOUTH CENTRAL LOS\nANGELES, YOU CAN'T SAY THAT THAT IS OKAY.\nIT'S THEY EVER OKAY TO SEE 3,000 PEOPLE SHOT IN CHICAGO OR 500\nMURDER THIS IS CHICAGO AND THAT IS ACCEPTABLE.\n>> THAT IS COMPLETELY UNFAIR. >> THESE NOT THE BEST CANDIDATE\nAND YOU CAN'T TRUST HER. I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU, JOY,\nBEFORE WE GO. HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU HAD\nHILLARY CLINTON'S AFRICAN-AMERICAN DIRECTOR OF\nOUTREACH ON YOUR SHOW? >> I DON'T THANK THAT IS\nRELEVANT. >> ZERO.\nSO THE POINT IS THAT YOU ASSUME THAT AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE\nAUTOMATICALLY GOING TO VOTE FOR HILLARY CLINTON AND I'M TELLING\nYOU, THAT THAT IS NOT THE CASE. >> ASSUMING THAT I CAN READ THE\nPOLLS. >> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS\nHAPPENED AS CERTAINLY WITH LATINO AND LATINO VOTERS AND\nMICHELLE, THANK YOU, AMARO STCHLT A, I AGREE WE DO NEED TO\nLISTEN TO DONALD TRUMP AND TO HIS SUPPORTERS AND GUESS WHAT?\nLATINO VOTERS A OBVIOUSLY LISTENING.\nAND WHEN YOU DISRESPECT A DEMOGRAPHIC SO CLEARY AND YOU\nTRY TO WALK IT BACK AND THEN COME BACK EVEN STRONGER LIKE\nDONALD TRUMP DID IN HIS PHOENIX SPEECH, THEN CLEARLY THE MESSAGE\nIS, AND WE KNOW THAT IN YOUR HEADQUARTERS OF THE DONALD TRUMP\nCAMPAIGNS RIGHT NOW, THERE IS FEAR IN YOUR CAMPAIGNS BECAUSE\nOF WHAT ARE A TEE KNOW -- >> HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?\nYOU'VE NEVER BEEN INTO OUR TOWERS.\nONLY 25% OF LATINOS ARE VOTING FOR DONALD TRUMP IN YOUR OWN\nNUMBERS WHICH SHOWS THAT LATINOS ARE NOT 100% BEHIND HER BECAUSE\nTHEY ARE NOT TRUSTING HER. >> LET ME SPEAK BECAUSE THE\nTRUTH IS THAT -- >> GO AHEAD, BUT DON'T TALK\nABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN TRUMP TOWER WHEN YOU'VE NEVER BEEN\nTHERE. >> YOU'RE RIGHT, I'VE NEVER BEEN\nTHERE. BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT -- LET ME\nSPEAK. THAT THE BIG STORY WILL BE THE\nLATINO VOTERS LISTENED. THEY HEARD AND THEY SAID WE\nDON'T LIKE WHAT WE'RE HEARING.

ASSUME THE RACE HAS BEEN CALLED.\nPEOPLE WHO WE TALKED TO WERE ASKED TO DESCRIBE IN A WORD EACH\nOF THE CANDIDATES. WE MADE A WORD CLOUD.\nCLINTON VOTERS DESCRIBED TRUMP AS SEXIST, RACISM.\nTRUMP VOTERS SAID CLINTON WAS CROOKED, CORRUPT AND A LIAR.\nBOTH CASES, THESE WERE THE ONLY WORDS WE COULD PUT ON THE\nTELEVISION SCREEN. YOU LOOK AT THE RHETORIC WE HAVE\nSEEN THE LAST 594 DAYS. WHAT DOES THE NEXT PRESIDENT DO?\nHOW CAN THE NEXT PRESIDENT BRING THIS COUNTRY TOGETHER?\nIS THAT A PIPE DREAM? >> THE LATTER, UNFORTUNATELY.\nWE ARE PART THE POINT OF NO RETURN.\nWHEN YOU DECIDE -- >> THANK YOU.\n>> I THINK WHEN YOU DECIDE THAT IT'S OKAY TO SPEAK THE WAY THAT\nPEOPLE ARE NOW SPEAKING TO EACH OTHER IN POLITICAL\nCONVERSATIONS, WHEN YOU SPEAK THE WAY DONALD TRUMP SPEAKS, I\nDON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN COME BACK FROM THAT AND BRING THE COUNTRY\nTOGETHER, WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE HILLARY CLINTON OR DONALD TRUMP.\n>> I'M A LITTLE LESS PESSIMISTIC THAN THAT.\nI'M STILL PESSIMISTIC. FEVERS BREAK A LITTLE AFTER\nELECTION DAY. THIS HAS BEEN A DRASTICALLY\nNASTIER CAMPAIGN THAN I HAVE BEEN USED TO.\nEVEN WHATEVER LEVEL OF NASTINESS YOU NORMALLY HAVE GOING INTO THE\nELECTION, IT RECEDES AFTERWARD. A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WERE\nENERGIZED ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN IN FAVOR OF ONE CANDIDATE ACCEPT\nTHE OTHER SIDE HAS WON AND TRY FOR A FEW MONTHS TO BE MORE OPEN\nMINDED. I'M HOPEFUL THERE WILL BE SOME\nOF THAT. >> EVEN WITH WHAT WE HEARD FROM\nDONALD TRUMP SUPPORTERS? >> I THINK IT WILL BE WORSE THAN\nNORMAL. I THINK THEY WILL BE LESS ANGRY\nAFTER THE ELECTION THAN THEY ARE RIGHT NOW.\n>> I DISAGREE. I TOTALLY DISAGREE.\nTHERE ARE SOME TRUMP SUPPORTERS -- A LOT WHO REALLY\nWANT TO WATCH THE WORLD BURN. I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING TO\nBE WILLING TO ACCEPT THE RESULTS OF AN ELECTION IF HE DOESN'T\nWIN. I THINK THERE ARE GOING TO BE --\nTHEY WILL BE MORE ANGRY THAN RIGHT NOW.\n>> THE THING I WORRY MORE ABOUT IS THE FACT THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON'S HONEST AND TRUSTWORTHY NUMBERS ARE REALLY BAD.\nIT'S NOT JUST STRONG DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTERS WHO DON'T VOTE\nHER, IT'S A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER WHO ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR HER.\nI THINK THAT'S GOING TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR HER, ASSUMING SHE\nWINS THE ELECTION, SHE WILL HAVE TO TRY TO CONVINCE PEOPLE ALL\nOVER THE SPECTRUM OR AT LEAST FROM THE LEFT THROUGH THE MIDDLE\nOF THE SPECTRUM THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS ACTING IN THEIR\nBEST INTEREST, THAT SHE HAS THE BEST INTERESTS OF AMERICANS\nBROADLY AT HEART. I THINK SHE STARTS AT A\nDISADVANTAGE. SO MANY HAVE DECIDED BECAUSE OF\nTHE E-MAIL AND THE WEB CONNECTING THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION AND ALL THE ASSOCIATED CLINTON STUFF THAT\nHAS SO MUCH MONEY SLOSHING AROUND, PEOPLE LOOK AT THAT WHEN\nA TEAM WHEN THEY DISTRUST INSTITUTIONS AND SAY THE\nCLINTONS DON'T SO RICH, I DON'T TRUST WHAT THE MONEY FLOWS MEAN,\nWHAT IT MEANS ABOUT WHO HAS INFLUENCE WITH HER.\nTHAT'S GOING TO BE A DISADVANTAGE FOR HER.\n>> WHAT'S BEEN INTERESTING IS OVER THE COURSE OF THE CAMPAIGN,\nSEEING THE EVOLUTION OF JUST ALL OF THIS.\nWE'RE LOOKING AT THIS NEW POLL OUT SHOWING 80% OF AMERICANS ARE\nREPULSED BY THE ELECTION. TURNED OFF.\nTHAT EXACT IDEA, ELECTION STRESS AND HOW PEOPLE ARE READY FOR\nTHIS THING TO BE OVER. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PESSIMISM\nTHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE, CAN SOMEBODY LIKE A PAUL RYAN --\nCOMING IN TO 2017, CAN SOMEBODY LIKE SOME OF THE YOUNGER\nDEMOCRATIC LEADERS AS WELL, CAN THEY WORK TOGETHER?\nONE OF THE THINGS PEOPLE HATE ABOUT WASHINGTON IS THE\nGRIDLOCK. IS THAT GOING TO GO ANYWHERE?\n>> I DON'T THINK PAUL RYAN WILL DO IT.\nHE WILL BE UNDER PRESSURE AS HE HAS BEEN FROM REPUBLICANS WHO\nARE TOTAL REJECTIONISTS, HATE HILLARY CLINTON, HATE ANYTHING\nTHE DEMOCRATS DO. HE WILL HAVE A SMALLER MAJORITY\nIN THE HOUSE ASSUMING HE STILL HAS ONE.\nHE WILL NEED THE MEMBERS OF THE CAUCUS TO BUILD A MAJORITY.\nHE WILL BE UNDER PRESSURE TO BE UNCOOPERATIVE.\n>> I THINK IT WILL BE WORSE THAN THE OBAMA YEARS.\nTHERE ARE PEOPLE IN CONGRESS WAITING FOR HILLARY CLINTON TO\nMAKE HER LIFE A LIVING HELL AND CERTAIN THEY CAN'T GET ANYTHING\nDONE. I DON'T KNOW HOW SOMEONE COMES\nIN AND TRIES TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER FOR SOUL SEARCHING\nAFTER AN ELECTION LIKE THIS. IT SEEPS COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE\nTO ME. >> WE HAD AN AMBITIOUS GOAL OF\nSOLVING THE COUNTRY'S PROBLEMS. I THINK THIS WAS MORE DEPRESSING\nTHAN WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. JOSH, OLIVIA --\n>> GLAD WE CAN HELP. >> THANKS FOR BEING HERE.\nCOMING UP, THEY HAVE BEEN WALLPAPER OR TV SCREENS WITH\nADS. BUT HOW ARE THE CLINTON AND\nTRUMP CAMPAIGNS REACHING OUT TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T SPENT TIME IN\nFRONT OF THEIR TV, ESPECIALLY THE CORD CUTTERS WHO MIGHT SWAY\nTHIS ELECTION?

IT'S ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT FEAR.\nFEAR ON ONE SIDE OF A CHANGING WORLD AND A CHANGING AMERICA.\nAND FEAR ON THE OTHER SIDE ABOUT DONALD TRUMP.\nWE HAVE A LOT TO COVER. WE WILL GET RIGHT TO IT.\nHERE IT IS, OUR FINAL BRAND-NEW NBC NEWS/WALL STREET JOURNAL\nPOLL OUT THIS MORNING. WE HAVE A TIGHTENING RACE.\nHILLARY CLINTON LEADING DONALD TRUMP BY FOUR POINTS IN THE\nFOUR-WAY MATCHUP. 44 TO 40.\nTHAT'S A BIG CHANGE FROM LAST MONTH'S POLL WHICH HAD CLINTON\nLEADING BY DOUBLE DIGITS, 11. THAT POLL, OF COURSE, TAKEN\nBEFORE THE JAMES COMEY E-MAIL ANNOUNCEMENT.\nLAST NIGHT IN RENO, NEVADA, TRUMP WAS RUSHED OFF STAGE WHEN\nSOMEONE IN THE CROWD SHOUTED GUN.\nTHERE WAS NO GUN. TRUMP DID RETURN TO FINISH THAT\nSPEECH. >> NOBODY SAID IT WAS GOING TO\nBE EASY FOR US. BUT WE WILL NEVER BE STOPPED.\nNEVER, EVER BE STOPPED. I WANT TO THANK THE SECRET\nSERVICE. THESE GUYS ARE FANTASTIC.\n>> AT THE SAME TIME, HILLARY CLINTON WAS RALLYING HER VOTERS\nWITH THE HELP OF KATY PERRY AND A CONCERT IN PHILADELPHIA.\n>> YOU READY TO ROCK FOR HILLARY?\n>> WHEN YOUR KIDS AND GRANDKIDS ASK YOU WHAT YOU DID IN 2016\nWHEN IT WAS ALL ON THE LINE, I WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO SAY, I\nVOTED FOR A BETTER, FAIRER, STRONGER AMERICA WHERE EVERYBODY\nHAS A CHANCE AT THE AMERICAN DREAM.\n>> THIS WEEKEND, THE TWO CAMPAIGNS ARE TAKING VERY\nDIFFERENT PATHS TO ELECTION DAY. TODAY, HILLARY CLINTON AND TIM\nKAINE ARE TARGETING A NUMBER OF STATES IN AN ATTEMPT TO TRY TO\nCHECK MATE TRUMP. MICHIGAN, NOT YET LIT UP ON OUR\nBOARD, IS SUDDENLY IN PLAY. TOMORROW CLINTON AND PRESIDENT\nOBAMA AND BILL CLINTON ARE ALL GOING TO BE SATURATING THAT\nSUDDENLY INTO THE BATTLEGROUND STATE.\nDONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE HAVE NO CLEAR PATH.\nTHEY ARE THROWING SPAGHETTI AT THE WALL, TRYING TO FIND SOME\nCOMBINATION OF NEW STATES, LIKE MINNESOTA, THAT WILL GET THETO\n270 ELECTORAL VOTES. OF COURSE, THEY STILL HAVE TO\nWIN THE TRADITIONAL BATTLEGROUND STATES, FLORIDA, OHIO AND NORTH\nCAROLINA AND FIND A COUPLE OF BLUE STATES TO FLIP.\nIOWA LOOKS GOOD. IS IT MICHIGAN?\nWE HAVE CORRESPONDENTS ALL OVER THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\nWE WILL BEGIN IN PHILADELPHIA WHERE HILLARY CLINTON WILL BE\nWAKING UP THIS MORNING. THAT'S WHERE WE FIND OUR KRISTIN\nWELKER. PHILADELPHIA, WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?\n>> Reporter: CHUCK, PENNSYLVANIA IS A PART OF SECRETARY CLINTON'S\nFIREWALL. IN ORDER TO WIN HERE, IN ORDER\nTO WIN THE WHITE HOUSE, SHE HAS TO GET LARGE MARGINS OF\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS IN URBAN AREAS LIKE RIGHT HERE IN\nPHILADELPHIA. THAT WAS ON DISPLAY DURING THAT\nKATY PERRY CONCERT HERE LAST NIGHT.\nCLINTON HAS MADE 16 STOPS TO PENNSYLVANIA SINCE THE DNC.\nA LOT OF THOSE STOPS AIMED AT ENERGIZING AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nVOTERS. CONSIDER THIS.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA GOT 93% OF THE BLACK VOTE HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA\nIN 2012. CLINTON DOESN'T NEED TO MATCH\nTHAT. SHE'S GOT TO GET COMPARABLE\nNUMBERS. IT'S IN OTHER BATTLEGROUNDS LIKE\nNORTH CAROLINA AND OHIO WHERE SHE WILL BE JOINED BY LeBRON\nJAMES. AND TO HELP HER MAKE HER CASE,\nSHE HAS A MILLION VOLUNTEERS STRETCHED ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY\nHELPING TO GET OUT THE VOTE. >> THERE YOU GO.\nNOW LET'S GO TO WILMINGTON, NORTH CAROLINA, CHECK IN ON\nWHERE DONALD TRUMP WILL BE WITH KATIE TOR.\n>> DONALD TRUMP IS VISITING EIGHT STATES IN TWO DAYS.\nTHEY ARE TAKING A RENEWED INTEREST IN MICHIGAN WHERE THEY\nSAY INTERNAL POLLING SHOWED THEM IN A DEAD HEAT WITH HILLARY\nCLINTON. WHY?\nTHEY SAY THEIR JOBS MESSAGE IS CUTTING ACROSS ALL DEMOGRAPHICS\nIN THAT STATE. IN ORDER FOR THEM TO GET TO 270,\nTHEY BELIEVE MICHIGAN IS ABSOLUTELY THEIR BEST PATH.\nIF THEY DO WIN THAT STATE, THEY CAN AFFORD TO LOSE PENNSYLVANIA\nWHERE HILLARY CLINTON IS CURRENTLY POLLING IN THE LEAD.\nALSO, NEVADA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE. THEY ARE MAKING A SURPRISE VISIT\nTO MINNESOTA, A STATE THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA WON BY EIGHT\nPOINTS IN 2012. BUT THE CAMPAIGN DOES CONCEDE\nTHAT IN ORDER TO WIN, THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIND A BLUE\nSTATE AND TURN IT RED. CHECK?\n>> KATY, THANKS VERY MUCH. NOW LET'S GO TO THE SWING STATE,\nPERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT SWING STATE OF THEM ALL, FLORIDA.\nIT'S IN ORLANDO THAT WE'RE GOING.\nWE LIKE TO SAY ON THIS SHOW, FLORIDA, FLORIDA, FLORIDA.\n>> Reporter: IT LOOKS LIKE THIS YEAR AS WELL.\nEARLY VOTING SMASHING ALL KINDS OF RECORDS.\nJUST OVER THIS WEEKEND, THE DEMOCRATS HAVE STARTED OUTPACING\nTHE REPUBLICANS. BIG REASON, 200,000 MORE\nHISPANIC VOTES HAVE BEEN CAST ALREADY THIS YEAR THAN IN ALL OF\n2012. A WORD OF CAUTION FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON. SHE'S BEHIND WHERE BARACK OBAMA\nWAS IN 2012. THAT'S WHY THE PRESIDENT IS\nCOMING HERE TODAY, BIG PUERTO RICAN POPULATION.\nHE WANTS TO RUN UP THE SCORE FOR HER BEFORE ELECTION DAY.\nBECAUSE ON ELECTION DAY, REPUBLICANS TEND TO OUTVOTE THE\nDEMOCRATS. THIS IS THE LAST DAY OF EARLY\nVOTING HERE IN FLORIDA. INCLUDING MOST OF THE BIG\nPOPULATION CENTERS. MAKE NO MISTAKE, CHUCK, LOOKING\nLIKE ANOTHER HEART-STOPPING ELECTION DAY IN FLORIDA.\n>> SURE DOES. THANKS VERY MUCH.\nFINALLY, OUR FINAL STOP ON THE MAP THIS MORNING, IT'S ACTUALLY\nUSUALLY FIRST STOP OF ANY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, IT'S IN\nTHE GREAT PRIMARY CITY OF MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE, WHERE\nWE FIND OUR OWN ANDREA MITCHELL WHO HAS BEEN COVERING HILLARY\nCLINTON FOR DECADES. ANDREA, WHAT DO YOU GOT?\n>> Reporter: THIS IS NOT THE WAY HILLARY CLINTON WANTED TO FINISH\nUP. HER PLAN TO END ON A POSITIVE\nNOTE GOT UPENDED BY THE FBI LETTER, FORCING HER TO FIGHT\nBACK. FOR THE PAST WEEK, EVERYWHERE WE\nHAVE GONE WITH HER, SHE HAS BEEN REMINDING VOTERS OF EVERY THING\nDONALD TRUMP HAS SAID. TOMORROW NIGHT, THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN WILL TAKE TWO MINUTES. THEY ARE PAYING FOR A COMMERCIAL\nON NBC PRIMETIME AND ON CBS. THEY'RE HOPING TO REACH 20\nMILLION PEOPLE. IT WILL BE ALL ABOUT UPLIFTING,\nINCLUSIVE AMERICA. THEY ARE MAKING IT AS WE SPEAK.\nIT'S GOING TO INCLUDE THAT STRONGER AMERICA THEME.\nFIRST, OF COURSE, TONIGHT SHE WILL BE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE WHERE\nVOTERS FAMOUSLY ARE LATE DECIDERS.\nCLINTON WILL BE INTRODUCED BY THE GOLD STAR FATHER WHO THE\nCAMPAIGN SAYS REPRESENTS THE VERY BEST OF AMERICA AND\nPRESIDENT OBAMA COMING BACK HERE TOMORROW.\n>> THANK YOU. AS WE MARCH TOWARDS ELECTION\nDAY, WE CAN TELL YOU THAT AS OF YESTERDAY, NEARLY 40 MILLION\nPEOPLE HAVE ALREADY VOTED. WE EXPECT THE TOTAL EARLY VOTE\nTURNOUT TO BE 50 MILLION BY TUESDAY.\nTHERE ARE STRONG INDICATIONS THIS WEEKEND THE HISPANIC VOTE\nIS UP SHARPLY IN LAS VEGAS AND ALONG THE CRITICAL I-4 CORRIDOR\nOF FLORIDA. THAT WOULD BE VERY GOOD NEWS FOR\nHILLARY CLINTON. JOINING ME NOW IS THE CHAIRMAN\nOF THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN, JOHN PODESTA.\nMR. PODESTA, WELCOME BACK TO \"MEET THE PRESS.\"\n>> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU. >> TALK ABOUT THE GOOD NEWS ON\nHISPANIC TURNOUT. BUT YOU ARE HAVING STRUGGLES\nWITH AFRICAN-AMERICAN TURNOUT. WE HAVE SEEN INDICATIONS NORTH\nCAROLINA, GEORGIA, OHIO, MICHIGAN, THAT ALL THAT TURNOUT\nAMONG AFRICAN-AMERICANS IS DOWN IN THE EARLY VOTE.\nI WILL PUT UP A NORTH CAROLINA STAT HERE THAT SHOWS IT DOWN\nALMOST 6% FROM THE TURNOUT IN 2012.\nWHY DO YOU THINK YOU ARE HAVING TROUBLE MOTIVATING\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE? >> WELL, LOOK, ALL THE WAY\nTHROUGH THE PRIMARIES, AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS CAME OUT\nFOR HILLARY CLINTON. WE EXPECT THAT AGAIN NOW.\nAND WE'RE WORKING VERY HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS.\nSHE IS CAMPAIGNING ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nCOMMUNITIES. WE HAVE HAD THE PRESIDENT OUT\nFOR US. YOU KNOW, YOU ARE COMPARING US\nAGAINST THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT\nRUNNING FOR RE-ELECTION. WE THINK WE CAN HIT THOSE\nNUMBERS. THE PRESIDENT IS HELPING US DO\nTHAT. BUT WE BUILT A DIFFERENT KIND OF\nCOALITION AND A BIGGER COALITION.\nYOU MENTIONED THE HISTORIC HISPANIC TURNOUT WE'RE SEEING IN\nFLORIDA, IN NEVADA, WHERE WE FEEL GOOD.\nOBVIOUSLY, MORE WORK TO DO BETWEEN NOW AND TUESDAY.\nWE HAVE HAD COLLEGE EDUCATED WOMEN VOTING IN HIGHER NUMBERS,\nVOTING FOR HER IN HIGHER NUMBERS.\nASIAN AMERICANS VOTING", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1478462350899.1478459479614.7a874b14-9d76-44c4-8475-9874132dbfcc.segment5.thumb.jpg", "channel": "356"}, {"start": 883103, "length": 32600.0, "end": 915703, "date": 1478479431056, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1478482104565.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1478479428631-2c9efdc1-001b-462b-94e6-ce0de322a3e9-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=883.10,915.70", "text": ">>> CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE STORY\nTHIS SUNDAY, NOVEMBER SURPRISE FROM THE FBI THE CLINTON PROBE\nIS OVER, KAPUT, GOOD-BYE, CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON BY THE FBI DIRECTOR HIMSELF.\nWHAT A SHOWSTOPPER TWO NIGHTS BEFORE THE ELECTION.\nREPORTS OF SURGING.

YOU ALREADY ARE SEEING FROM\nKELLYANNE CONWAY, DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER, SENDING OUT A\nTWEET SAYING, YOU KNOW, TO THE DEMOCRATS WHO ARE SAYING HA, HA,\nWE TOLD YOU SO, WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WAY THAT YOU TRASHED JAMES\nCOMEY BEFORE? TO BE FAIR, WHAT THE DEMOCRATS\nAND WHAT THE HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN -- HILLARY CLINTON\nHERSELF, WHAT THEY HAD BEEN SAYING, CERTAINLY, THEY WERE\nVERY CRITICAL OF COMEY. BUT IT WAS BECAUSE HE LEFT SUCH\nA GRAY AREA. HE ALLOWED THE SPECULATION.\nHE SORT OF THREW THIS OUT THERE WITHOUT ANY CONCLUSION.\nALLOWED THE REPUBLICANS TO INTERPRET IT IN A WAY THAT\nBENEFITTED THEM IN THE HIGHEST, HIGHEST, SORT OF MOST POLITICAL\nMOMENT IN ANY TIME IN AMERICAN HISTORY.\nSO THAT IS WHY, AMERICAN HISTORY, WHAT I MEAN IS A WEEK\nOR SO BEFORE A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.\nSO THAT IS WHY THIS IS TURN ON ITS HEAD.\nPRIVATELY, I WAS TEXTING WITH A SENIOR REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST,\nWHO SAID THAT THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THIS IS GOOD FOR\nHILLARY CLINTON. YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE VOTES THAT\nHAVE ALREADY HAPPENED, EARLY VOTING, BUT THERE IS NO QUESTION\nIT IS GOOD. THE QUESTION FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON, HOW ARE THEY GOING TO GET THIS OUT THERE?\nI WAS TEXTING WITH A CLINTON AIDE WHO SAID, WELL, IT'S MORE\nOF A DISTRACTION BECAUSE IT WAS BLOCKING OUT THE SUN.\nTAKE FROM THAT WHAT YOU WILL. >> TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS\nHAVE ALREADY VOTED IN EARLY VOTING.\nGLORIA BORGER, I'LL BRING YOU IN HERE.\nWE SHOULD MAKE A NOTE TO PEOPLE WHO THIS IS THEIR FIRST\nPRESIDENTIAL ELECTION THEY'VE PAID ATTENTION TO, MAYBE SOME\nYOUNGER VIEWERS. WHEN GROWN-UPS USE THE TERM\nOCTOBER SURPRISE, USUALLY, THERE IS ONE OF THEM.\nNOT 30 OF THEM. WE HAD THE AC\"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD\"\nVIDEO, THE WOMEN MAKING ACCUSATIONS, THE COMEY LETTER\nFROM OCTOBER 28th AND NOW WE'RE IN NOVEMBER, I SUPPOSE.\nBUT THIS IS ALL RATHER UNCHARTD TERRITORY.\n>> WE'RE NOT USED TO NOVEMBER SURPRISES.\nIN TERMS OF TALKING ABOUT HOW DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ARE\nGOING TO REACT TO THIS, I'VE BEEN TEXTING WITH A COUPLE OF\nDEMOCRATS WHO ARE STILL FURIOUS AT COMEY.\nBECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT HE JUST BASICALLY SAID, NEVERMIND.\nAFTER TURNING THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE ON ITS HEAD NOT TOO LONG\nAGO. THEY BELIEVE THAT HE DID NEED TO\nDO THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND THE FEAR IS THAT THE DAMAGE\nHAS BEEN DONE BECAUSE, AS YOU POINT OUT, THERE HAVE BEEN\nMILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE EARLY VOTED, AND MAYBE SOME OF\nTHOSE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE VOTED FOR HILLARY CLINTON AND DECIDED\nNOT TO AFTER THIS. THE QUESTION -- AND REPUBLICANS,\nOF COURSE, WILL BE FURIOUS WITH HIM FOR MAKING THE CASE THAT,\nOH, BY THE WAY, NOTHING HAS CHANGED, AND THIS QUICKLY.\nWE SHOULD NOTE THAT IT IS REMARKABLE THAT THE FBI OR\nANYTHING IN GOVERNMENT HAS MOVED AS QUICKLY AS THIS HAS.\nSO THAT'S KIND OF STUNNING TO EVERYBODY.\nI'M SURE THAT THE REPUBLICANS WILL SAY, WELL, WELL, WELL, THIS\nIS A BIT OF A WHITEWASH, WE ARE SURE.\nIT'S NOT AS IF HE HAS REMOVED THE FBI FROM POLITICS NOW.\nBECAUSE I THINK THE DAMAGE WAS ALREADY DONE WHEN HE SENT HIS\nORIGINAL LETTER TO CONGRESS. WHEN WE PULL BACK FROM THIS,\nBOTH SIDES WILL STILL BE ANGRY WITH HIM.\nTHE QUESTION IS, DOES HILLARY CLINTON TALK ABOUT THIS A LOT OR\nNOT? I MEAN, I THINK THAT IS A\nDECISION THEY HAVE TO MAKE. I BELIEVE THAT DONALD TRUMP\nPROBABLY WILL JUST CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON AND\nHER E-MAILS, AS HE DID BEFORE TODAY.\n>> INTERESTING. GLORIA BORGER, PAMELA BROWN AND\nDANA BASH, THANK YOU, ONE AND OFF.\nJEFF ZELENY IS TRAVELING WITH THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN.\nTHEY ARE IN CLEVELAND, OHIO, RIGHT NOW.\nA VERY KEY BATTLEGROUND, WHERE POLLS HAVE THE CANDIDATES NECK\nAND NECK.

JEFF, WE HAVE NOT YET HEARD FROM\nSECRETARY CLINTON SINCE THIS NEWS BROKE.\nHER CAMPAIGN HAS COME OUT AND SAID THAT THEY FEEL THE MATTER\nIS RESOLVED AND CLINTON IS EXONERATED.\n>> THEY HAVE, JAKE. SHE IS ON HER WAY TO THIS RALLY\nSITE. HERE, YOU CAN SEE DEMOCRATIC\nSENATOR SHERROD BROWN IS WARMING UP THE CROWD.\nSHE COULD BE HERE ANY MINUTE. THEY ARE STILL DECIDING IF SHE\nWILL ADDRESS THIS. I TALKED TO ONE AIDE EARLY ON\nWHO SAID HE ASSUMED SHE WOULD ADDRESS THIS.\nTHE REALITY IS, THE BEST WAY FOR THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN TO GET THIS\nWORD OUT IS FOR THE CANDIDATE HERSELF TO MAKE A STATEMENT FROM\nTHE PODIUM. THAT'S NOT YET BEEN DECIDED, I'M\nTOLD. THIS WILL BE HER FIRST\nOPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A STATEMENT HERE.\nSHE HAS ANOTHER EVENT THIS EVENING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.\nI HAVE BEEN TALKING TO DEMOCRATS CLOSE TO THE CAMPAIGN.\nONE DEMOCRAT TOLD ME THIS, HE SAID, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FULLY\nUNDO THE DAMAGE THE LAST NINE DAYS.\nI ASKED WHY. A LOT OF EARLY VOTE HAS ALREADY\nCOME IN. EVEN MORE THAN THAT, THE\nCAMPAIGN KNOWS THAT THIS, YOU KNOW, REVELATION AND\nCONVERSATION OVER THE LAST NINE DAYS HAS DAMAGED SECRETARY\nCLINTON AMONG INDEPENDENTS AND REPUBLICAN WOMEN, LEANING TOWARD\nVOTING FOR HER AND SWITCHED IN THE LAST NINE DAYS.\nONE OTHER DEMOCRAT CLOSE TO THE CAMPAIGN DESCRIBED THIS TO ME AS\nA WOUND THAT CANNOT BE QUICKLY HEALED.\nSO IT IS UNCLEAR IF THIS WILL CHANGE THE LAST CHAPTER OF THE\nRACE. THE CAMPAIGN SAYS IT IS\nRESOLVED. THAT MAY BE TRUE, BUT\nPOLITICALLY, IT STILL HAS, YOU KNOW, PUT ALL THIS INTO THE\nATMOSPHERE HERE THAT WON'T QUICKLY DISSIPATE.\nJAKE, WHAT WE'RE WATCHING FOR HERE IS HILLARY CLINTON,\nAPPEARING HERE WITH LEBRON JAMES, TO TALK ABOUT HIS\nENDORSEMENT, WILL DISCUSS THIS WHEN SHE CAMPAIGNS IN CRITICAL\nCLEVELAND. CRITICAL CUYAHOGA COUNTY, OHIO,\nONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SWING COUNTIES IN THE COUNTRY.\n>> JEFF, LET ME ASK YOU, TWO DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION, TWO\nDAYS IS GENERALLY, IN POLITIC, NOT CONSIDERED ENOUGH TIME TO\nDELIVER A MESSAGE. THERE ARE NO DOUBT GOING TO BE\nMILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHO GO TO THE POLLS ON TUESDAY WHO KNOW\nABOUT COMEY'S LETTER FROM TWO FRIDAYS AGO BUT DO NOT END UP\nLEARNING ABOUT THIS NEW LETTER BEFORE THEY VOTE.\n>> NO QUESTION. PEOPLE ARE VOTING AS WE SPEAK,\nAT THIS HOUR HERE IN OHIO. AND SO MANY OTHER EARLY VOTING\nSTATES. THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN REALIZES\nTHIS WILL TAKE A FEW DAYS TO CLEAN UP, JUST AS IT DID SORT OF\nTO SEEP INTO THE ATMOSPHERE.

OUR CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST\nGLORIA BORGER. SENIOR POLITICS REPORTER, NIA\nMALIK HENDERSON, AND DANA BASH. THE DAMAGE TO HILLARY CLINTON\nAND HER CAMPAIGN OVER THE PAST NINE DAYS, IS THE DAMAGE ALREADY\nDONE? >> IN MANY WAYS, YES.\nTHERE IS NO QUESTION. IF THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS\nEARLY VOTING, MAYBE THE DAMAGE WOULD BE NEGATED A LITTLE BIT.\nYOU'RE THE EARLY VOTING EXPERT HERE, BUT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE\nHAVE GONE AND VOTED. THEY DID SO WITH THIS\nINFORMATION FRONT AND CENTER IN THE CAMPAIGN.\nYOU KNOW, LEADING THE DYNAMIC OF THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL RACE.\nTHE BIGGEST THING THAT HURT HILLARY CLINTON WAS JUST PUTTING\nTHIS QUESTION OF THE FBI, THE QUESTION OF INVESTIGATIONS FRONT\nAND CENTER. THAT BEING THE FOCUS AND NOT\nWHAT IT WAS BEFORE, WHICH WERE, YOU KNOW, DONALD TRUMP'S \"ACCESS\nHOLLYWOOD\" TAPE, THE ALLEGATIONS OF GROPE SKING, SO ON AND SO RT.\nTHE FACT IT HAS SHIFTED TO HILLARY CLINTON'S BIG, BIG\nPROBLEM, THE FACT THAT SHE HAS BEEN HERE IN WASHINGTON FOR SO\nLONG AND ALLOWED THE DRAIN THE SWAMP AND EVERYTHING ELSE TO\nBECOME FRONT AND CENTER, THAT WAS VERY PROBLEMATIC.\nNOW, YOU KNOW, CAN SHE RECOVER IN THE NEXT TWO DAYS?\nMAYBE. IT CERTAINLY WAS A BIG, BIG\nMISTAKE FOR HER. IT HELPED DONALD TRUMP A LOT.\n>> THE POLLS WERE TIGHTENING. GLORIA, HERE'S WHAT THE SPEAKER,\nPAUL RYAN, IS SAYING ABOUT THE LETTER RELEASED TODAY BY\nDIRECTOR COMEY. REGARDLESS OF THE DECISION, THE\nUNDISPUTED FINDING OF THE FBI'S INVESTIGATION WAS SECRETARY\nCLINTON PUT OUR NATION'S SECRET AT RISK AND COMPROMISED OUR\nNATIONAL SECURITY. FORTUNATELY, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\nHAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE SECRETARY CLINTON NEVER GETS HER\nHANDS ON CLASSIFIED INFORMATION AGAIN.\nVERY STRONG STATEMENT FROM THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE.\n>> THAT IS BECAUSE, A, THIS IS A GOOD ISSUE FOR THEM AND, B, THE\nFBI DIRECTOR LAST JULY CALLED HILLARY CLINTON RECKLESS.\nHE DECIDED NOT TO PROSECUTE. HE DECIDED NOT TO PROCEED ANY\nFURTHER. HE MADE AN EDITORIAL STATEMENT.\nI THINK THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL SIN.\nI THINK THAT'S WHERE ALL OF THIS COMES FROM.\nTHE ORIGINAL SIN, OF COURSE, I SHOULD SAY, WAS HILLARY CLINTON\nUSING A PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER. >> YEAH.\n>> LET'S GO BACK TO THAT. BUT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE FOUND\nAN ISSUE THAT MOTIVATES THEIR BASE.\nTHAT INDEPENDENT VOTERS LOOK AT. IT GOES TO THE HONEST AND\nTRUSTWORTHY ISSUE. I'M NOT SURPRISED THAT THEY'RE\nNOT GIVING UP ON IT. IT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE DONALD\nTRUMP'S STUMP SPEECH ONE BIT. HILLARY CLINTON, I WAS TOLD\nTODAY BY A SENIOR ADVISER, IS NOT GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT\nTHE FACT THAT SHE WAS EXONERATED IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM\nBECAUSE SHE DOESN'T WANT TO BE TALKING ABOUT E-MAILS IN THE\nLAST COUPLE OF DAYS OF THE CAMPAIGN.\n>> DONALD TRUMP, WE'RE WAITING FOR HIM TO SPEAK SOON, WE'RE\nTOLD. WE'LL HAVE LIVE COVERAGE OF\nTHAT. THE REPUBLICAN VICE PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATE, MIKE PENCE, IN NORTH CAROLINA, RESPONDED TO THIS\nLATEST DEVELOPMENT. HE SAID THIS.\n>> I GUESS TODAY, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD, TODAY THEY\nANNOUNCED THEY HAD NOT CHANGED THAT CONCLUSION.\n>> YOU KNOW, MISHANDLING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION IS A\nCRIME. HILLARY CLINTON, LET'S REMEMBER\nWHAT WE KNOW. HILLARY CLINTON SAID SHE'D NEVER\nSENT OR RECEIVED ANY CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.\nTHE DIRECTOR OF THE FBI TOLD THE CONGRESS, CLASSIFIED INFORMATION\nWAS SENT. HILLARY CLINTON SAID THERE WAS\nNOTHING MARKED CLASSIFIED ON HER E-MAILS, SENT OR RECEIVED.\nTHE FBI DIRECTOR TOLD THE CONGRESS, THAT'S NOT TRUE.\n>> WHAT'S YOUR REACTION? >> THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF LUCY\nAND THE FOOTBALL QUALITY TO THIS INVESTIGATION.\nOVER AND OVER AGAIN, REPUBLICANS HAVE EXAGGERATED THE POLITICAL\nIMPACT OF THIS INVESTIGATION AND EXAGGERATED HOW MUCH THEY THINK\nPOLITICAL JEOPARDY HILLARY CLINTON IS UNDER.\nHOW LIKELY WAS IT THAT MORE OF HUMA ABEDIN'S E-MAILS WERE GOING\nTO BE ANY DIFFERENT THAN THE ONES -- THAN THE THOUSANDS THE\nFBI ALREADY LOOKED INTO? INSTEAD OF SORT OF PLAYING IT\nCOOL, PENCE AND TRUMP BASICALLY SAID HILLARY WAS ABOUT TO GO TO\nJAIL BECAUSE OF COMEY REOPENING THIS INVESTIGATION.\nI MEAN, IT WAS ENTIRELY PREDICTABLE.\nIT WAS LIKELY THERE WASN'T GOING TO BE A WHOLE LOT ON THIS HARD\nDRIVE. >> YOU KNOW THAT DONALD TRUMP,\nDAVID, IS GOING TO SAY THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS RIGGED.\n>> HE'S BEEN SAYING THAT. HE'LL KEEP SAYING THAT.\nAS GLORIA SAID, HE'LL SAY IT REGARDLESS OF EVENTS AS THEY\nDEVELOP. REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO\nCONTINUE TO MAKE THIS CASE THAT COMEY LET CLINTON OFF THE HOOK\nIN JULY. DEMOCRATS WILL MAKE THE CASE\nTHAT THE TWO LETTERS IN THE LAST NINE DAYS WERE OUT OF BOUNDS FOR\nHIM. BIG PICTURE, DONALD TRUMP WANTS\nTO CONTINUE TO DRIVE THIS NARRATIVE THAT THE MEDIA, THAT\nTHE GOVERNMENT, THAT EVERYTHING IS RIGGED AGAINST HIM AND HIS\nSUPPORTERS. HE PRESENTED NO SPECIFIC\nEVIDENCE OF THIS. I DON'T THINK ANY OF THE EVENTS\nWITH THE FBI, YOU KNOW, SUPPORTS HIM.\nNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN THE SECOND LETTER, I THINK CLINTON CAN GET\nBACK TO HER MAIN MESSAGE. >> DONALD TRUMP.\nTAKE YOU TO THE PODIUM. LET'S HEAR FROM WHAT HE HAS TO\nSAY. >> ONCE AGAIN, NO POLITICIAN\nWILL DO THAT. THEY DON'T HAVE A CLUE.\nI'VE BEEN FIGHTING FOR THE CAR INDUSTRY FOR YEARS.\nI WAS HONORED FIVE YEARS AGO. MAN OF THE YEAR IN MICHIGAN.\nTHAT WAS A GREAT HONOR FOR ME. DURING MY SPEECH, ALL I TALKED\nABOUT IS WHAT MEXICO AND THESE OTHER COUNTRIES ARE DOING TO US.\nESPECIALLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO MICHIGAN.\nTHAT'S ALL I TALKED ABOUT. I WAS CRITICIZED.\nTHEY SAID, DONALD, SPEAK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.\nI SAID, NO. WHAT'S HAPPENING IS HORRIBLE.\nWHAT'S HAPPENING IS TERRIBLE. ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS I RAN\nFOR PRESIDENT IS TO STOP IT. THESE POLITICIANS WILL NEVER DO\nIT. THEY'LL NEVER DO ANYTHING ABOUT\nIT. I WANT TO SHARE -- THEY'LL NEVER\nDO IT, FOLKS. WE'LL BRING THE JOBS BACK AND NO\nMORE ARE GOING TO BE LEAVING. THERE ARE GOING TO BE\nCONSEQUENCES IF THEY LEAVE. I WANT TO SHARE A SPECIAL\nMESSAGE WITH MY MANY FRIENDS IN THE UNION ALL ACROSS THE STATE.\nTHE UNIONS LOVE ME. AND THE NON-UNIONS LOVE ME, TOO,\nI WILL TELL YOU. AS WELL AS TO DEMOCRATIC VOTERS\nHERE AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THE ECONOMIC POLITIES OF BILL\nAND HILLARY CLINTON HAVE BLED MICHIGAN DRY.\nALMOST MORE THAN ANY OTHER PLACE.\nTHEY RAKE IN HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM SPECIAL\nINTERESTS WHO SPECIALIZE IN SHIPPING YOUR JOBS TO OTHER\nCOUNTRIES. THE CLINTONS GAVE US NAFTA.\nTHINK OF IT. THE WORST TRADE DEAL EVER SIGNED\nBY ANY COUNTRY EVER. CHINA'S ENTRY INTO THE WORLD --\n>> WE'LL CONTINUE TO MONITOR DONALD TRUMP.\nHE'S IN A STUMP SPEECH RIGHT NOW.\nIF HE SPEAKS ABOUT THE JAMES COMEY LETTER, WE'LL GO BACK\nTHERE LIVE. STAND BY.\nMARK, YOU THINK HE'S GOING TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE PUBLICLY?\nI'M SURE IT IS A DISAPPOINTMENT TO HIM AND HIS CAMPAIGN THAT THE\nFBI DIRECTOR HAS NOW CONCLUDED THE SAME CONCLUSION HE HAD IN\nJULY, NO RECOMMENDED CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON.\n>> I SUSPECT THE INFORMATION IS LIKE ACID RIGHT NOW.\nIT'S EATING HIM UP INSIDE. HE REALLY WANTS TO DO IT.\nTHE QUESTION IS, IF HE DOES, HOW WILL HE DO IT?\nWILL HE DO IT IN A WAY THAT GOES BACK AND HARKENS TO THE TIME OF\nHIM GOING OFF THE REELS AND TRYING TO RALLY UP THE CROWD, OR\nIN A WAY THAT SAYS, LOOK, THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF WHAT I'VE\nBEEN SAYING. IT IS A RIGGED SYSTEM, TO TRY TO\nGET VOTERS TO COME TO HIM. LOOK, IT IS 50/50 ON WHAT\nHAPPENS WITH THAT. >> WHAT DO YOU THINK?\n>> YEAH, I MEAN, SO FAR, IF WHAT WE'VE SEEN OF DONALD TRUMP IS\nANY GUIDE, I THINK HE'S PROBABLY GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT\nCONTINUOUSLY IN HHYPERBOLE. HE COMPARED  D IT TO WATERGATE.\nWHAT WE HEARD AT THE CONVENTION, THE IDEA THAT HILLARY CLINTON\nSHOULD BE IN JAIL. LOCK HER UP.\nI IMAGINE THAT IT WILL BE STILL IN THAT SAME VEIN, MAKING THESE\nBROAD ARGUMENTS. ESSENTIALLY SAYING THE LAST 30\nYEARS OF CLINTON AND CLINTON BEING SURROUNDED BY\nCONTROVERSIED AND SCANDALS, IF YOU LIKE THAT, YOU'LL LIKE A\nCLINTON IN THE WHITE HOUSE. >> THIS EPISODE OVER THE 11 DAYS\nDID SOMETHING THAT WAS VERY IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIS AIDES TO DO\nUP UNTIL THEN. WHICH IS, BRING SOMETHING INTO\nFOCUS SO THAT HE COULD LATCH ON TO IT AND STICK TO IT.\nIT WORKED. I MEAN, FOR -- LOOK, THERE HAVE\nBEEN TIMES OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS WHERE HE HAS GONE WAY OFF\nSCRIPT. BUT FOR THE MOST PART, HE\nHASN'T. HE'S BEEN AS DISCIPLINED AND\nFOCUSED AS HE HAS THIS ENTIRE YEAR AND A HALF.\nAS ONE AIDE TOLD ME, I WAS REPORTING ON WHY HE WAS\nDISCIPLINED, ONE OF HIS ASSOCIATES SAID IT WAS LIKE A\nTHUNDERBOLT FROM GOD WHEN THE FBI LETTER CAME TWO FRIDAYS\nAFWOE. I\n -- AGO. IT ALLOWED HIM TO FOCUS.\nISN'T SOMETHING YOU CONTINUE COME UP TO AS AN AIDE WITH A\nCANDIDATE WHO HAS TROUBLE WITH DISCIPLINE.\n>> YOU CAN'T TURN AROUND -- HE CAN'T CRITICIZE THE FBI AFTER\nAPPLAUDING THE FBI. >> I THINK HE CAN.\nGOD GIVETH AND GOD TAKETH AWAY. >> LET HIS SURROGATES DO IT.\n>> HAVE YOU MET DONALD TRUMP? >> THERE IS A LOT MORE COMING\nUP. 40 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE\nALREADY VOTED OVER THESE PAST FEW DAYS.\nANOTHER 70 OR 80 MILLION EXPECTED TO VOTE BY TUESDAY.\nMUCH MORE ON THE BREAKING NEWS RIGHT AFTER THIS.", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1478481665902.1478478889487.06bbffbc-9ab2-4a89-99af-3cdad06237b0.segment2.thumb.jpg", "channel": "202"}, {"start": 1439125.0, "length": 125568.0, "end": 1564693, "date": 1478478891972, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1478481558506.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1478478889487-06bbffbc-9ab2-4a89-99af-3cdad06237b0-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=1439.12,1564.69", "text": ">>> BREAKING NEWS TONIGHT, THE\nFBI CLEARING HILLARY CLINTON AGAIN IN THE PROBE INTO HER\nPRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER THAT SHE USED AS SECRETARY OF STATE.\nTHE FBI DIRECTOR, JAMES COMEY, TELLING CONGRESS NEWLY\nDISCOVERED E-MAILS, WHOSE REVELATION ROCKED THE U.S.\nPRESIDENTIAL ELECTION NINE DAYS AGO HAVE BEEN FOUND IRRELEVANT\nAND KEPT HIS EARLIER FINDING, THAT CLINTON SHOULDN'T BE\nCHARGED.

THE OTHER THING TO JEFF'S POINT,\nTO JNEWT GRINGRICH'S POINT, A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT'S CHIEF\nCOUNCIL WAS STOOD UP TO, AND THE CHIEF OF STAFF, WHEN THEY WANTED\nTO AUTHORIZE THE DOMESTIC D SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM THAT WAS\nILLEGAL AND JIM COMEY WAS ABOUT TO RESIGN.\nHE STOOD UP TO POLITICAL PRESSURE.\nI THINK HIS LEADERSHIP OF THE AGENCY, JUDGMENT HERE, WHY HE\nDID IT IS ALL FAIR QUESTIONS.

I DON'T FEEL THAT WAY AT ALL.\nI THINK COMEY DID REAL DAMAGE TO THE COUNTRY.\nI THINK HE DID DAMAGE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND REAL DAMAGE TO\nTHE HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN. THE HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN WAS\nPUSHED BACKWARDS, BOTH GEOGRAPHICALLY AND MORALLY OVER\nTHIS PAST WEEK. THEY HAD TO FALL BACK TO THE\nBLUE STATES AND HOLD ON, AND THEY DIDN'T END HIGH.\nHAD THIS NOT HAPPENED, THE COUNTRY WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER\nOFF BECAUSE YOU WOULD AT LEAST HAVE THE HILLARY CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN ABLE TO STAY HIGH.

THE ANSWER IS, TO PAUL'S POINT,\nYES, THE ISSUES. TRADE, ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION,\nJOBS. THESE ARE IMPORTANT ISSUES IN\nPENNSYLVANIA. IT IS A KEY STATE.\nWHAT THIS DID IS SAY, VERY CLEARLY, SHE'S THE PROBLEM.\nFORGET THE FBI. WHY DID THE FBI HAVE TO BE\nINVOLVED IN THE FIRST PLACE?

HE'S GONE ON TO HAVE A VERY\nDISTINGUISHED CAREER IN SECURITY STUDIES.\nBUT AS HE WAS WATCHING THIS CAMPAIGN AND REFLECTING ON THE\nSERVICE HE DID AS A YOUNG MAN, HE REALIZED HE COULD NEVER\nSUPPORT DONALD TRUMP. AND HE CALLED OTHER LAUNCH\nOFFICERS, SOMETIMES CALLED M MISSILEERS, AND ASKED WHAT THEY\nWERE THINKING. TO A PERSON, THIS IS\nUNACCEPTABLE. THIS IS ACTUALLY SCARY.\nSEVERAL DOZENS OF THEM WROTE A LETTER SAYING THAT THEY KNOW\nWHAT THE AWESOME RESPONSIBLE IS, THAT A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES HOLDS, AND THEY COULD NEVER SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP TO BE\nOUR PRESIDENT AND COMMANDER IN CHIEF.\nAND IF YOU BELIEVE LIKE I DO THAT OUR ECONOMY GROWS AND\nAMERICA THRIVES WHEN THE MIDDLE CLASS GROWS AND THRIVES, THEN\nYOU HAVE TO VOTE, TOO.

YOU CAN'T DO IT, FOLKS.\nHILLARY CLINTON IS GUILTY. SHE KNOWS IT.\nTHE FBI KNOWS IT. THE PEOPLE KNOW IT.\nAND NOW, IT IS UP TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO DELIVER\nJUSTICE AT THE BALLOT BOX ON NOVEMBER 8th.\n>> IT GI GIVES YOU AN INDICATIOF HOW TRUMP IS GOING TO USE THIS\nAS AN ISSUE TO BENEFIT HIM THE NEXT FEW DAYS, REGARDLESS OF\nWHAT THE FBI DIRECTOR SAYS. >> REOPENING THE INVESTIGATION,\nTRUMP HAS BEEN TALKING  ING ABO ON THE TRAIL BASICALLY EVERY DAY\nSINCE IT HAPPENED. >> WHICH IS STUNNING.\nWE SAW KELLYANNE CONWAY OUT THERE TODAY SAYING THIS HAS NOT\nBEEN A MAJOR ISSUE OF THEIR CAMPAIGN.\nTHIS HAS NOT OPINION A MAJOR MESSAGING POINT.\nLET'S BE CLEAR, ANDERSON, THIS WAS A POLITICAL GIFT WHEN COMEY\nORIGINALLY SENT THE LETTER TO CONGRESS.\nDONALD TRUMP AND HIS CAMPAIGN SEIZED ON THAT.\nHE TALKED ABOUT IT AT BASICALLY EVERY TRUMP RALLY SINCE THEN.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS INSISTED TO PEOPLE IF THEY ELECT HILLARY\nCLINTON, SHE'S GOING TO BE INDICTED AND UNDER INVESTIGATION\nFOR YEARS. THE NOTION THAT DONALD TRUMP DID\nNOT USE THIS MOMENT TO PROPEL HIS CANDIDACY IN RECENT DAYS IS\nJUST -- DOESN'T BEAR WEIGHT, ANDERSON.\n>> RIGHT. AS PAUL WAS SAYING IN THE LAST\nHOUR,TWEETED OUT THE DAY OF THE COMEY LETTER,\nTHIS WAS A GOOD DAY FOR THE CAMPAIGN, CLOSE TO A DIRECT\nQUOTE. WHAT IS THE CAMPAIGN SAYING\nABOUT THE POTENTIAL IMPACT THE NEWS WILL HAVE, OR ARE THEY?\n>> THEY'RE DOWN PLAYING THE IMPACT THIS WILL HAVE.\nOBVIOUSLY, IT IS A SHORT TIME FRAME BETWEEN NOW AND WHEN\nPEOPLE GO TO THE POLLS. MANY PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY GONE TO\nTHE POLLS BETWEEN COMEY'S FIRST LETTER AND HIS SECOND.\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN ESSENTIALLY SAYS THEY SAW BATTLEGROUNDS\nTIGHTENING BEFORE COMEY'S FIRST LETTER TO CONGRESS.\nIT WAS ON THE WAKE OF OBAMACARE NEWS AND THE WAKE OF SOME OF THE\nJOHN PODESTA E-MAILS WE SAW IN WIKILEAKS AS IT RELATES TO\nHILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN. THEY'VE SEEN REPUBLICANS START\nCOMING HOME. THEY'RE SEEING INDEPENDENTS\nBREAKING THEIR WAY. THEY DON'T EXPECT THAT TO\nCHANGE. THE QUESTION, ANDERSON, IS IF\nTHERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WERE STILL ON THE FENCE, WHO WERE STILL\nWAITING TO SEE, FOR INSTANCE, WHETHER SOMETHING MORE WOULD\nCOME FROM THE FBI, THIS COULD SWAY THEM.\nYOU KNOW, WHETHER THIS WILL MAYBE MAKE HILLARY CLINTON\nSUPPORTERS MORE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT TURNING OUT AT THE POLLS.\nWE HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS TO SEE WHAT IMPACT,\nIF ANY, THIS WILL HAVE ON THE RACE.\n>> SARAH MURRAY, THANKS.

WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF COMEY COMING\nOUT WITH THE LETTER? IT SURPRISED FOLKS WHO THOUGHT\nHE WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING MORE BEFORE THE ELECTION.\n>> IF HE KNEW THERE WAS A PROSPECT OF THE INVESTIGATION,\nTHE MORE RECENT REVELATIONS BEING WRAPPED UP WITHIN TWO\nWEEKS, HE SHOULD NEVER HAVE SENT LETTER NUMBER ONE.\nI THINK IT IS OBVIOUS. I DON'T THINK IT IS GOING TO\nMOVE THE NEEDLE. IT OCCURS AS WE ARE IN THE FINAL\nSTRETCH OF THIS THING, THAT THIS HAS BEEN A CAMPAIGN OF\nTREMENDOUS DRAMA. I REFLECT ON THE JOHN McCAIN\nMOMENT, WHICH I THOUGHT WOULD BE A GAME CHANGER.\nWHEN THE COMMENTS, THE APPALLING COMMENTS THAT DONALD TRUMP MADE\nABOUT JOHN McCAIN, RESPECTING THE ONES THAT DON'T GET\nCAPTURED, WHEN THAT DIDN'T MOVE THE NEEDLE, IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN\nA WAKEUP CALL. FEW THINGS WERE GOING TO.\nREALLY, THERE HAS BEEN A CONSISTENCY TO THIS ELECTION\nFROM THE GET GO. WHEN IT HAS BEEN THE TWO OF\nTHEM, IT'S BEEN SOMEWHERE IN THAT THREE TO FIVE RANGE.\nTHAT APPEARS TO BE WHERE WE ARE TONIGHT.\n>> JEFF, FROM THE LEGAL PERSPECTIVE, YOU WERE SURPRISED\nTHAT COMEY CAME TO THIS DECISION SO QUICKLY AFTER THE LAST LETTER\nAND MADE AN ANNOUNCEMENT. >> ABSOLUTELY.\nI WAS SURPRISED HE MADE THE INITIAL ANNOUNCEMENT.\nGIVEN HOW NEGATIVE THE REACTION WAS, YOU KNOW, AMONG --\nREPUBLICAN VETERANS OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS\nDEMOCRATS TO THE FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT, I THOUGHT THE BEST\nTHING HE COULD DO WAS SIMPLY KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT.\nI THINK HE FELT, AGAIN, AS HE DID THE FIRST TIME, WORRIED\nABOUT LEAKS FROM INSIDE THE FBI. THIS TIME, HE WAS WORRIED THAT\nIT WOULD LEAK THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAD BEEN EXONERATED.\nHE FELT LIKE HE DIDN'T WANT TO KEEP THAT SECRET.\nAND BE ACCUSED OF, YOU KNOW, TRYING TO PROTECT DONALD TRUMP.\nHE MADE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY. I THINK ALL OF IT JUST\nUNDERLINES WHY HE SHOULD HAVE KEPT HIS MOUTH SHUT FROM THE\nBEGINNING, HONORED THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TRADITION OF NOT\nGETTING INVOLVED IN THE CAMPAIGNS DURING THIS PERIOD,\nSHORTLY BEFORE ELECTION DAY. >> WHEN I FIRST HEARD THIS, YOU\nMIGHT THINK THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS GOING TO JUMP ON THIS.\nHILLARY CLINTON WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THIS IN SPEECHES.\nTHEY ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT IT. >> ANY TIME SHE'S TALKING ABOUT\nINVESTIGATIONS AND E-MAILS, SHE'S TALKING ABOUT\nINVESTIGATIONS AND E-MAILS. IF COMEY WAS GOING TO HAVE A\nLETTER, THE FACT -- I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE PREFERRED THIS\nCONVERSATION NOT HAPPEN AT ALL. IF COMEY IS SAYING SOMETHING,\nYOU WANT IT TO BE FBI CLEARS CLINTON AGAIN.\nINTI RATHER THAN FBI STILL NEEDS TO\nINTERVIEW PEOPLE. THE RACE HAS SETTLED BACK INTO A\nSTATIC PLACE. IT'S DONE THAT MANY TIMES.\nIT ALSO HAS TAKEN WILD SWINGS. THE \"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD\" TAPE.\nTHE COMEY ANNOUNCEMENT. NOT JUST THE COMEY ANNOUNCEMENT.\nIT CAME ALSO AT A TIME, THE OBAMACARE PREEMMIUM INCREASES\nCAME. DONALD TRUMP WAS ON MESSAGES,\nI'LL REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE.\nTHAT BROUGHT REPUBLICANS HOME AND INDEPENDENTS HIS WAY.\nIN THE LAST COUPLE DAYS, BEFORE THE JIM COMEY ANNOUNCEMENT, THE\nRACE SETTLED THERE A THREE OR FOUR-POINT HILLARY CLINTON LEAD.\nTHE DEMOGRAPHICS SUGGEST TO YOU THAT IF HER PEOPLE TURN OUT, SHE\nSHOULD WIN THE ELECTION. DOESN'T MEAN SHE WILL WIN THE\nELECTION. DOESN'T MEAN DONALD TRUMP\nDOESN'T HAVE A CLOSER RACE THAN SOME OF THE BIG, BLUE\nBATTLEGROUND STATES LIKE PENNSYLVANIA.\nCLOSER. BUT ABOUT THE SAME GAPS YOU HAD\nIN THE ROMNEY/OBAMA RACE. A POINT ABOVE IN SOME STATES AND\nA POINT BELOW IN OTHERS. IT'S A STATIC RACE.\n>> I NEVER DISAGREE WITH YOU. >> PLEASE DO.\n>> EXPECT IN DAYS ENDING IN \"Y.\" I DON'T THINK IT MAKES A\nDIFFERENCE IN THE OUTCOME. AS A TEXAN, THE PRESIDENT LOST\nTEXAS BY 16 POINTS. HILLARY MAY LOSE TEXAS BUT THE\nSURGE OF LATINO VOTERS THERE, I'M GETTING REPORTS FROM FRIENDS\nAND FAMILY IN TEXAS. LINES AROUND THE BLOCK.\nONE YOUNG MAN TALKING ABOUT TAKING AN ELDERLY WOMAN IN HER\n70s OR 80s TO THE POLLS IN A WALKER.\nSHE WAITED THREE AND A HALF HOURS LEANING ON HER WALKER TO\nVOTE.

WHAT I SEE AS THE PATH TO\nVICTORY, FLORIDA, OHIO, NEVADA, IOWA, IT'D GIVE TRUMP 265.\nIN FOUR OF THE FIVE STATES, REPUBLICANS ARE OUTPERFORMING\nNUMBERS FROM 2012. THERE IS SO MUCH ENTHUSIASM.\nMORE VOTES CAST EARLY THAN 2012 IN THE FIVE STATES THAT WOULD\nPUT TRUMP AT 265. YOU'RE NEGLECTING THE NEW\nHAMPSHIRE POLL NUMBERS THAT WOULD PUT HIM OVER THE TOP ON\nTUESDAY. >> HERE'S THE THING, I THINK THE\nTWO BIG SURGES ARE HAPPENING. THERE IS A LATINO SURGE.\nTHERE MAY BE A BIG REPUBLICAN SURGE HERE.\nI DON'T THINK THESE THINGS HAVE TO BE --\n>> YOU'RE RIGHT. >> >>AT THE END OF THE DAY, I\nTHINK THE DEMOCRATS WILL HAVE IT.\nWE'LL HAVE A LOT TO SORT THROUGH WHEN WE'RE DONE.\n>> THERE IS DATA. 57% OF THE VOTERS IN FLORIDA\nYESTERDAY WERE WHITE. 67% OF THE VOTERS IN FLORIDA ARE\nWHITE.

NOT THE PHILADELPHIA SUBURBS.\n>> THAT'S WHERE HE WAS. >> HE WAS IN HARRISBURG.\n>> OKAY. >> HARRISBURG.\nYOU KNOW, MY POINT HERE IS, SHE ALSO SAYS BETWEEN SATURDAY AND\nTOMORROW, BOTH CAMPAIGNS WILL HAVE BEEN IN PENNSYLVANIA 18\nTIMES, WHICH REALLY SAYS THEY'RE REALLY TRYING TO BEGGIN UP THEI\nRESPECTIVE BASES.

IF NORTH CAROLINA STARTS TO LEAN\nBLUE, I AS A TRUMP SUPPORTER, WILL BE WORRIED.\n7:30, FLORIDA COMES.

TRUMP, THIS IS NOT YOUR AMERICA.\nAND ON TUESDAY -- AND ON TUESDAY WE ARE GOING TO PROVE AMERICA\nBELONGS TO ALL OF US! #.\n>> THE HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN TRYING TO TURN THE PAGE HERE IN\nNEW HAMPSHIRE AND THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT IT.\nIT'S A CLOSE RACE IN THIS STATE AND THERE IS NOT ANY EARLY\nVOTING. IT ALL HAPPENS ON TUESDAY.\nTHE CAMPAIGN IS VERY AWARE OF THE FACT THAT BERNIE SANDERS WON\nBY A BIG MARGIN IN THE PRIMARIES.\nTHEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT ALL THAT. MICHIGAN AGAIN TOMORROW.\nTHAT'S ANOTHER STATE HILLARY CLINTON LAST LOST IN THE\nPRIMARIES AS WELL. >> GLORIA BORGER.\nTHE FBI SAID THEY ARE GOING TO STICK WITH THE JULY DECISION\nTHAT NO REASONABLE PROSECUTOR WOULD BRING CHARGES AGAINST\nCLINTON. SHE WAS CARELESS, BUT NOT\nCLINTON. HOW WILL IT AFFECT THE RACE SN\nDO WE KNOW SN. >> WE DON'T KNOW.\nTHE FBI SAID NEVER MIND TO WHAT THEY DID ALMOST TWO WEEKS AGO.\nTHEY DID UP END THE RACE TO A GREAT DEGREE.\nWE DON'T KNOW THE IMPACT AND I WILL TELL YOU WHY.\nTENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE VOTED AND SOME OF THEM MAY HAVE BEEN\nPEOPLE WHO DECIDED TO VOTE BECAUSE THEY WERE FED UP WITH\nHILLARY CLINTON'S E-MAILS. WE HAVE NO IDEA.\nWE DON'T KNOW HOW BARKED THIS ISSUE WAS IN TERMS OF E-MAILS\nAND BY THE WAY, THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS NOT EXACTLY GOING\nOUT ON STAGE AND TRUMPETING WHAT WE HAVE ON THE KYRON HERE.\nTHE FBI CLEARS CLINTON AGAIN. HILLARY CLINTON IS NOT GOING TO\nTALK ABOUT IT. SHE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT\nHER E-MAILS RIGHT NOW. SHE WANTS TO HAVE HER CLOSING\nMESSAGE HEADING INTO THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS OF THE CAMPAIGN.\nSHE DOESN'T WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE OF THE E-MAIL ISSUE SO\nSHE HAD THE PRESS SECRETARY TWEETING SAYING WE ARE GRATIFIED\nTHAT THIS IS CONCLUDED AND EXONERATED.\nYOU ARE NOT GOING TO SEE THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN TRUMPETING IT\nAND IT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE THE THEME ANYWAY WHICH HAS ALWAYS\nBEEN CROOKED HILLARY AND HE WILL CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT E-MAILS\nAND CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION AND HE WILL\nSAY AS JIM SAID THAT THEY COULDN'T HAVE GONE THROUGH ALL\nTHE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF E-MAILS IN EIGHT DAYS.\nAT THIS POINT IT'S SO LATE AND HARD TO KNOW THE IMPACT IS IF AT\nALL. IF THERE IS DAMAGE TO HILLARY\nCLINTON AND I THINK THERE WAS, I THINK IT'S DONE.\n>> THE DAMAGE MAY HAVE BEEN DONE.\nIT'S A GOOD POINT. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE VOTED EARLY\nIN THE LAST NINE DAYS. WE HAVE TO BE FOOLS TO BELIEVE\nTHEY WERE NOT AFFECTED BY THE ORIGINAL COMEY LETTER.\nARE THEY VOTES SHE CAN NEVER GET BACK SN.\n>> NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. IT WAS INTERESTING WHEN THIS\nINVESTIGATION WAS REOPENED LAST WEEK AND WHAT IT WAS ABOUT NINE\nOR TEN DAYS AGO. DONALD TRUMP SAID LOOK AT THE\nPEOPLE WHO HAD GONE OUT AND VOTED.\nTHEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO VOTE AGAIN AND HE CITED A COUPLE OF\nSTATES WHERE YOU CAN DO THAT. YOU CAN'T DO THAT.\nEARLY VOTING CLOSED. WHAT WILL BE INTERESTING IS TO\nSEE HOW THE LOCAL MEDIA IN THREE STATES COVER THIS OVER 24 AND 36\nHOURS. PENNSYLVANIA, NEW HAMPSHIRE AND\nMICHIGAN. THREE STATES THAT DON'T ALLOW\nEARLY VOTING. IT'S DAY OF.\nIT'S BASICALLY DAY OF VOTING. DONALD TRUMP WHO IS ABOUT TO\nTAKE THE STAGE RIGHT NOW. HILLARY CLINTON AND SPRINGSTEEN\nAND BILL CLINTON AND EVERYONE IS GOING TO SHOW UP IN PENNSYLVANIA\nFOR A CLOSING RALLY. IT'S KEY TO SEE IF THE CAKE IS\nALREADY BAKED AND THERE WAS NO DOUBT DAMAGE DONE TO HILLARY\nCLINTON. WE SAW DONALD TRUMP'S MOMENTUM\nAND HILLARY CLINTON STALLING WHEN THAT LETTER WAS RELEASED.\nAND CAN SHE GET VOTERS. >> THE POLLS HAVE TIGHTENED UP\nAND POLLS ARE SHOWING 45% CLINTON AND 42% TRUMP.\nSHE HAD MOMENTUM BEFORE THIS LETTER WENT OUT AND AFTER THAT\nIT SHOWED IT DID DAMAGE HER SOMEWHAT.\nHOW MUCH DID COMEY'S ANNOUNCEMENT OVER THE NINE DAYS\nHURT HILLARY CLINTON. >> I THINK THAT ANNOUNCEMENT\nHURT HER SERIOUSLY. IN WAYS THAT DON'T RELATE TO\nGATHERING VOTES. SHE WAS DEPRIVED OF WHAT WOULD\nHAVE BEEN HER VICTORY LAP IN THE FINAL WEEK.\nTHEY PLANNED TO LAY OUT HER VISION FOR THE COUNTRY AND HER\nPRESIDENCY AND THEY HOPED TO USE HILLARY CLINTON TO CAMPAIGN FOR\nSOME OF THE KEY DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES FOR SENATE AND\nGOVERNOR AND HOUSE. IT'S CRITICAL FOR HER TO GET AT\nLEAST ONE HOUSE OF CONGRESS EVEN IF IT'S BY JUST A VOTE.\nCOMEY TOOK A LOT OF THAT AWAY FROM HER.\nHAVING SAID THAT AND HAVING ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE RACE HAS\nTIGHTENED BECAUSE IT BROUGHT REPUBLICANS HOME TO TRUMP, I\nDON'T BELIEVE FOR A MINUTE THAT THIS IS EVEN VAGUELY CLOSE.\nI THINK THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS GOING TO DO FAR BETTER, FAR\nBETTER THAN THE 268 ELECTORAL VOTES YOU SHOW ON THE MAP.\nSHE WILL PROBABLY GO WELL ABOVE 300 AND I DON'T THINK THE\nPOPULAR VOTE IS GOING TO BE AS CLOSE AS ONE POLLING AVERAGE\nSHOWS IT TO BE. >> WHY IS THAT.\n>> WHY IS IT SN I KNOW MARK PRESTON AND OTHERS POINTED OUT\nMANY TIMES THE DEMOGRAPHICS IN THE UNITED STATES MOVED TOWARDS\nTHE REPUBLICANS AND MOST PENITENTIARILY OF ALL, DONALD\nTRUMP ALIENATED THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT NEW GROUP OF VOTERS.\nLATINOS. THE LATEST SURVEY OUT BY THE\nEXCELLENT LATINO DECISIONS SHOWS JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS BEFORE THE\nELECTION, HILLARY CLINTON IS GETTING ABOUT 76% OF THE\nHISPANIC VOTE. THAT'S FIVE POINTS HIGHER THAN\nBARACK OBAMA GOT IN 2012. IT WAS A RECORD WHEN OBAMA GOT\nIT. DONALD TRUMP IS IN THE\nMID-TEENS. PEOPLE SAID NOBODY COULD\nPOSSIBLY DO WORSE THAN MITT ROMNEY WHO GOT 27%.\nSOMEBODY IS DOING A LOT WORSE. >> I WANT TO ASK YOU THIS.\nWE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE DAMAGE.\nWHAT ABOUT THE NARRATIVE THAT IS ON EVERY SINGLE NEWS CHANNEL AND\nNEWSPAPER. THE TRUMP PEOPLE AND DONALD\nTRUMP HIMSELF HAVE BEEN OUT GIVING THE NARRATIVE AND ONE\nAGENCY SAID AN INDICTMENT IS IMM\nIMMINENT. WHAT DO YOU GET THE NINE DAYS\nBACK. THAT'S VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE.\n>> IT IS. YOU DON'T GET BACK THE NINE\nDAYS. THE ORIGINAL SIN WAS HAVING THE\nPRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER. SHE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT AND\nEVERYBODY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT. THE NEXT THING WAS COMEY IN JULY\nCOMING OUT AND SAYING OKAY, I'M NOT GOING TO PROSECUTE HER, BUT\nSHE WAS RECKLESS WITH HER E-MAILS.\nTHAT EDITORIALIZING, IF YOU WILL, WAS OUT OF THE ORDINARY\nFOR AN FBI DIRECTOR AND IN HINDSIGHT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN\nDONE. HE CAME OUT AND SAID OKAY, I'M\nGOING TO REOPEN THIS INVESTIGATION.\nTHERE IS NO WAY THAT SHE CAN GET BACK THE NINE DAYS THAT SHE LOST\nPLAYING DEFENSE TO A GREAT DEGREE.\nWHAT IT DID FOR DONALD TRUMP IS IT GAVE HIM AN EASY MESSAGE TO\nSTAY ON AND CARRY, WHICH HE DID WITH THE HELP OF HIS STAFF.\nFOR THE FIRST TIME HE WAS USING THE SAME PLAYBOOK AS HIS SENATE\nCANDIDATES DOWN BALLOT. THEY COULD BE UNITED AS A\nREPUBLICAN PARTY AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON AND AGAINST THE PROBLEM\nSHE HAD WITH HER E-MAIL SERVER. IT REALLY WORKED FOR THEM.\nCRYSTALLIZED A MESSAGE. MAYBE CONVINCED A BUNCH OF\nINDEPENDENT VOTERS OR MODERATE REPUBLICANS TO SAY YOU KNOW\nWHAT, I CAN'T VOTE FOR HER. THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN THINKING\nABOUT IT, BUT SHE CAN'T GET IT BACK.\nHOWEVER THE RACE IS SETTLED AS WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT.\nSHE SEEMS TO BE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THREE AND FIVE POINTS\nHATE. THINGS ARE GOING OKAY FOR HER\nWHICH IS WHY SHE DOESN'T WANT TO GO BACK TO TALKING ABOUT THE\nE-MAILS EVEN IF IT'S GOOD NEWS. >> PROBABLY A GOOD STRATEGY.\nI WANT TO BRING IN MATTHEW MILLER, FORMER SPOKES PERSON FOR\nTHE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. HE SUPPORTS HILLARY CLINTON.\nFIRST, LET ME GET YOUR REACTION TO THE LETTER.\n>> I'M GLAD HE PUT THE LETTER OUT AND TRIED TO CLEAN UP THE\nMESS HE MADE. THERE IS NO UNRINGING THAT BELL.\nTHAT'S SNAG IS COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE TO DO AND VIOLATES\nTHE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE GUIDELINES.\nHE TRIED TO COME OUT AND CLEAN THE MESS UP, BUT NO GOING BACK.\nIT'S NOT JUST WHAT HE SAID IN HIS LETTER NINE DAYS AGO, BUT\nTHE LEAKS THAT HE UNLEASHED. THE AGENCY ARE SAYING ALL SORTS\nOF THINGS ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON. >> LEAKS THAT WERE NOT TRUE.\n>> IN MANY CASES. WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN IS THE RULES\nDON'T APPLY TO ME. I'M NOT ACCOUNTABLE TO THE\nATTORNEY GENERAL AND OTHER PROSECUTORS.\nAGENTS THINK YOU HAVE DONE THAT TOO.\nTHE LEAKS UNFAIRLY TARNISH HILLARY CLINTON AND ARE\nINAPPROPRIATE. >> FOR SHE DOES NOT WIN, WILL\nYOU HOLD COMEY RESPONSIBLE SN. >> FIRST OF ALL I THINK SHE IS\nGOING TO WIN. IT SEEMS LIKELY.\nIF SHE DOESN'T, CERTAINLY HE WILL HAVE PLAYED A BIG PART.\nTHAT IS AN UNCONSCIONABLE THING FOR THE FBI TO HAVE DONE.\nTHEIR ROLE IS TO ADMINISTER JUSTICE.\nI WILL SAY HIS INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT GOES BACK TO JULY WHEN\nHE CAME OUT AND RECOMMENDED NO CHARGES, BUT IN DOING SO DID\nSOMETHING THAT NO DIRECTOR IS SUPPOSED TO DO AND PASSED\nJUDGMENT ON HER CONDUCT. IT WAS INAPPROPRIATE THEN AND\nFIRST IN A SERIES THAT CULL MIN RATED IN THE MOST E GREEJUOUS.\n>> IF THEY CAN GET THIS DONE IN NINE DAYS, THEY COULD GET ALL OF\nIT DONE BEFORE ANNOUNCING ANY OF IT.\n>> THAT'S THE RIGHT POINT. THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO COMMENT\nON ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS, PERIOD.\nTHEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO IT SO CLOSE TO AN ELECTION AND YOU\nLOOK AT WHAT HE DID TODAY. WHY DID HE COME OUT AND SEND\nTHIS LAST WEEK. IF THEY CAN LOOK THROUGH THEM SO\nQUICKLY AND FIND THEY WERE DUPLICATES AND THERE WAS NOTHING\nNEW HERE, WHY DID THEY RUSH IT SO CLOSE TO THE ELECTION.\nTHEY COULD HAVE LOOKED THROUGH THEM FIRST AND FOUND THERE WAS\nNOTHING AND SAID THAT OR HANDLED AT THIS TIME WAY THEY DO OTHER\nINVESTIGATIONS AND BEEN QUIET ABOUT IT.\nTHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE FAR WISER COURSE OF ACTION.\n>> YOU ARE LOOKING AT DONALD TRUMP ARRIVING AT A BIG RALLY\nTHERE THIS EVENING. IN PENNSYLVANIA.\n>> NO MATTER WHO WINS ON TUESDAY, SHOULD HE RESIGN SN.\n>> THE CURRENT SITUATION IS UNTENABLE.\n>> YOU CANNOT HAVE THEM UNACCOUNTABLE TO ANYONE.\nHE MADE SERIOUS MISTAKES AND SAID YOU KNOW WHAT, I MESSED UP\nAND I'M GOING TO LEANCH FROM IT. THE NEW ATTORNEY GENERAL IS THAT\nHE LEADS IN SOME FORM OR FASHION.\n>> YOU ARE LOOKING AT DONALD TRUMP ARRIVING IN MOON TOWNSHIP\nPENNSYLVANIA GIVING A BIG RALLY IN THE FINAL MOMENTS OF THE\nCAMPAIGN. WE WILL SHOW BOTH OUT ON THE\nCAMPAIGN TRAIL TONIGHT, TOMORROW, ALL UP UNTIL ELECTION\nDAY. STAY WITH US FOR COVERAGE.\nIT ALL STARTS ON TUESDAY. WHEN WE COME BACK, A MAN WHO SAW\nTHIS WHOLE THING COMING AND SAID THAT JAMES COMB HE NO CHOICE BUT\nTO SPEAK OUT ELECTION DAY. >> WHAT GREAT PEOPLE.\nWHEN WE WIN, WE ARE BRINGING STEEL BACK.\nWE ARE GOING TO BRING STEEL BACK TO PENNSYLVANIA.\nLIKE IT USED TO BE. WE ARE PUTTING OUR STEELWORKERS\nAND MINERS BACK TO WORK. WE ARE.\nWE WILL BE BRINGING BACK OUR ONCE GREAT STEEL COMPANIES.\nWE ARE GOING TO BE BRINGING BACK NEW STEEL COMPANIES.\nAND PLENTY OF OTHER COMPANIES.

THERE WAS AN ARTICLE IN THE \"NEW\nYORK TIMES\" AND EVEN HIS DAUGHTER, IVANKA IS CONCERNED\nABOUT BRAND DAMAGE AFTER THIS. >> SHE SHOULD BE.\nYOU JUST HAVE THE COUNTRY CREATE NEGATIVE AND THAT IS GOING TO\nIMPACT YOUR BUSINESS. DONALD TRUMP WENT FROM HAVING A\nHIGH END WELL RESPECTED BRAND TO NOW HALF THE COUNTRY HAVING A\nNEGATIVE IMPRESSION OF HIM. I FORGET WHO CAME OUT WITH THE\nCOLOR.

THE EARLY VOTE MARK WAS TALKING\nABOUT IS THE CASE. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE GONE TO\nVOTE. WE ARE SEEING A LOT OF BIG\nSURGES OF LATINO AND BLACK VOTER AT THE TAIL END OF THE ELECTION.\nNOT VOTERS GOING OUT TO VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE OF THE\nFIRST COMEY LETTER. >> PARTICULARLY BECAUSE EARLY\nVOTERS TEND TO BE MORE PARTISAN ACCORDING TO RESEARCH DONE.\nTHAT SAID, IN THE LAST HOUR HE DOESN'T THINK HE'S GOOD TO HAVE\nE-MAIL BEFORE THAT. THE ONLY QUESTION ON THIS, MOST\nPEOPLE'S OPINIONS.

IT'S SEALED OFF THAT MESSAGE FOR\nTHEM WITH COMEY COMING OUT AND SAYING KIND OF NOTHING TO SEE\nHERE. WE TOLD YOU WE WERE LOOKING INTO\nIT. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN, IF THE NEXT TWO DAYS ARE WASTED TALKING ABOUT E-MAILS\nRATHER THAN TRYING TO GET BACK TO A CLOSING ARGUMENT THAT\nHIGHLIGHTS WHAT SECRETARY CLINTON WANTS TO OFFER TO HER\nCORE SUPPORTERS THAT'S PROBABLY NOT GOOD EITHER.\nBOTH CAMPAIGNS IN DANGER OF OVER PLAYING THIS.\n>> TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN IS CALLING THE INVESTIGATION INTO QUESTION\nHERE, ASKING HOW THE FBI COULD HAVE GOTTEN THROUGH 650,000\nE-MAILS. EXPLAIN HOW THEY DID IT.\n>> FIRST OF ALL, THE 650,000 NUMBER THAT WAS LEAKED TO ONE\nPUBLICATION, NO ONE KNOWS HOW MANY DOCUMENTS THERE WERE.\nSO I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD TAKE IT AS GOSPEL.\nTHERE ARE SUCH THINGS AS COMPUTERS THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY\nCAN USE TO PROGRAM AND IDENTIFY WHICH LETTERS, WHICH E-MAILS ARE\nWORTH READING. I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE FBI HAS\nDONE WHAT THEY SAID THEY DID. THEY HAVE NO INTEREST IN LYING\nABOUT HOW MANY E-MAILS THEY REVIEWED.\nTHE LARGER QUESTION IS WHY ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT THIS\nINVESTIGATION WHEN JIM COMEY NEVER SHOULD HAVE DISCLOSED IT\nIN THE FIRST PLACE. THERE IS A REASON WHY THE FBI\nDOESN'T DISCLOSE PARTIAL RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS.\nTHERE ARE REASONS WHY HE DOESN'T DISCLOSE INVESTIGATIONS OF\nPOLITICAL FIGURES SHORTLY BEFORE POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS.\nIT IS PRECISELY FOR THOSE REASONS THAT JIM COMEY SHOULD\nNOT HAVE DONE THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE.\nPERHAPS HE'S AMELIORATED SOME OF IT WITH THE LETTER TODAY.\nSHOULD HAVE FOLLOWED JUSTICE DEPARTMENT POLICY FROM THE\nBEGINNING. WE SHOULDN'T TALK ABOUT THIS AT\nALL. >> I COULD ADD THERE IS NOTHING\nINDICATING THAT THERE WAS 650,000 E-MAILS THAT REALLY WERE\nPERTINENT HERE. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT TENS OF\nTHOUSANDS OF E-MAILS. CERTAINLY NOTHING IN 650,000\nNUMBER THAT DONALD TRUMP AND HIS FOLKS HAVE BEEN USING.\nAS FAR AS THE REVIEW WAS CONCERNED OUR PRODUCER WAS TOLD\nBY A SOURCE IN THE END THIS DIDN'T INVOLVE BRINGING IN THE\nOTHER INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES TO REVIEW WHATEVER CLASSIFIED\nINFORMATION WAS FOUND. THAT TELLS US THAT THIS WASN'T\nEVEN A CLOSE CALL. DECIDE THAT THEY WERE\nDUPLICATES, PERSONAL OR WASN'T THAT BIG OF A DEAL.\nIT TURNS OUT IN THESE TEN DAYS THEY COULD DO A LOT OF WORK.\nTHEY USED SOFTWARE AROUND THE CLOCK.\nTHEY WERE ABLE TO REMOVE ALL THE ANTHONY WEINER STUFF THEY DIDN'T\nWANT TO LOOK AT FOR THIS INVESTIGATION.\nTHEY LOOKED AT A SMALLER SUBSET. NOT 650,000 AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN\nSAYING. >> SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF OTHER\nE-MAILS. I HAVE TO ASK YOU.\nIS THERE ANYTHING TO THAT? >> THERE IS TRUTH THAT THERE ARE\nFBI AGENTS WHO HAVE BEEN TAKING A LOOK AT ALLEGATIONS AGAINST\nTHE CLINTON FOUNDATION. WHAT WE ARE TOLD FROM FOLKS WE\nHAVE BEEN TALKING TO AND WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING INTO THIS FOR A\nYEAR. WE HAVE TALKED TO FOLKS IN THE\nJUSTICE DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS THE FBI.\nPROSECUTORS AND LAWYERS AT THE FBI BOTH LOOKED AT WHAT THE FBI\nHAVE BEEN ABLE TO TURN UP. SO FAR THEY BELIEVE THEY ARE\nSTILL LOOKING AT ALLEGATIONS THAT BASICALLY CAME FROM A BOOK\n\"CLINTON CASH\" WHICH WAS AN OPPOSITION RESEARCH BOOK THINLY\nRESEARCHED AND THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE TURNED UP.\nTHEY HAVEN'T TURNED UP MORE THAN THAT.\nIT'S NOT EVEN A FULL BLOWN INVESTIGATION.\nSTILL STUCK IN THE ASSESSMENT STAGE BECAUSE THE AGENTS AND\nINVESTIGATORS HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET MUCH MORE.\nIS THIS GOING TO DIE? PROBABLY NOT.\nCONGRESS WILL BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THIS.\nSOME OF THEM HAVE SAID ALREADY THEY ARE GOING TO KEEP LOOKING\nAT THIS. IF HILLARY CLINTON WAS ELECTED\nON TUESDAY YOU CAN BET THE ISSUE WON'T DIE.\n>> FROM A BOOK. EVAN, WHAT ABOUT THE TRUMP\nFOUNDATION? >> IT'S BEING LOOKED AT BY THE\nNEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL. WE KNOW THE FBI DOES HAVE\nSEVERAL TRUMP-RELATED INVESTIGATIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE\nEITHER SUPPORTERS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE AFFILIATED PREVIOUSLY WITH\nTHE CAMPAIGN. THOSE ARE IN THE SAME BOAT AS\nTHE CLINTON FOUNDATION. I WOULD PUT THEM IN THE SAME\nPLACE. TURNING INTO VERY MUCH.\n>> ALL FOR NOUGHT A LOT OF IT. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE NATIONAL\nPOLLS SINCE THE ORIGINAL COMEY LETTERS HAVEN'T CHANGED MUCH.\nWHAT ABOUT THE BATTLEGROUNDS? >> TO BUTTON UP THE LETTER, ONE\nIS THAT COMEY HIMSELF, WE DON'T THINK HE DID IT MALICIOUSLY.\nNOW HE HAS ANGERED BOTH SIDES. DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS.\nWE CAN QUESTION WHAT HE DID BUT THE FACT IS WE DON'T THINK IT\nWAS DONE MALICIOUSLY NECESSARILY.\nJEFFREY AND OTHERS KNOW HIM BETTER.\nAS FAR AS THE POLITICAL FALL OUT, I DON'T SEE HOW WE DON'T\nSAY IT HASN'T HAD AN EFFECT ON THE CAMPAIGN.\nTHAT'S ALL WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR EIGHT OR NINE DAYS.\nHER SUPPORTERS GET UPSET WITH IT.\nTHAT'S THE STORY. IF YOU LOOK AT THE BATTLEGROUND\nSTATES PHILIP IS RIGHT. WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN THE\nHISPANIC VOTE. SPECIFICALLY IN FLORIDA IT'S\nABOUT 105% INCREASE IN THE NUMBERS OF VOTES CAST FROM 2008\nTO 2016. YOU KNOW IN NEVADA THEY HAVE\nALSO SEEN A HIGH PERCENTAGE ALTHOUGH WE DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC\nNUMBERS BECAUSE THE STATE DOESN'T RELEASE SPECIFIC NUMBERS\nWHEN IT COMES TO ETHNICITY. THE FACT IS WE HAVE SEEN THE\nDEMOCRATIC MACHINE ABLE TO GET OUT THE HISPANIC VOTE.\nTHE QUESTION IS WE HAVE SEEN THE POLLS TIGHTENING IN THE\nBATTLEGROUND STATES. AND WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS ON\nELECTION NIGHT. I HAVE TO SAY THOUGH I THINK\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS A CLEARER PATH TO VICTORY THAN DONALD\nTRUMP. IT'S NOT AS IF DONALD TRUMP HAS\n280 ELECTORAL VOTES AND IS PROTECTING IT AT THIS POINT.\nHILLARY CLINTON ACCORDING TO OUR ESTIMATES IS AT 268 NOW.\nONLY NEEDS TO WIN ONE STATE AT THAT POINT TO GET OVER THE\nTHRESHOLD. IT'S A FIGHT TO THE WIRE.\nNOT AS IF HILLARY CLINTON IS IN A DEFICIT NOW TO DONALD TRUMP.\n>> I WANT YOU TO COMPARE AND CONTRAST THE TRAVEL SCHEDULES.\nTHAT TELLS US A LOT. >> WE WANT TO LOOK AT WHERE THEY\nARE GOING AS AN INDICATOR. IT ONLY MAKES SENSE, RIGHT?\nIT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT HILLARY CLINTON HAS TAILORED HER\nSCHEDULE OVER THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS TO BE ROTATING AROUND\nWHERE EARLY VOTING IS HAPPENING AS OPPOSED TO ELECTION DAY\nVOTING. THERE IS AN EXCUSE THEY USE\nWHICH IS THE REASON THEY ARE GOING TO MICHIGAN AND\nPENNSYLVANIA, THOSE ARE STATES VOTING ON TUESDAY WHERE THE\nOTHER STATES HAVE BEEN VOTING FOR WEEKS.\nTHERE IS VALIDITY TO THAT. THAT SAID THEY ARE NERVOUS ABOUT\nTHE STATES. THERE IS REASON TO BE ON THAT.\nDONALD TRUMP IS HOPSCOTCHING ALL OVER.\nI'M SKEPTICAL THAT'S DONE BASED ON SOUND POLLING AND AN\nASSESSMENT OF WHERE WE COULD DO THE MOST GOOD.\nIF HE COMES CLOSE IN MINNESOTA THEN I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE\nPROMISES, BUT WHO KNOWS? THAT'S BAFFLING.\nHE'S ALL OVER THE PLACE IN A WAY THAT'S A LITTLE HARDER TO PIN\nDOWN TO A PATTERN. IT SUGGESTS THE STATES WE HAVE\nBEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR WEEKS ARE STATES PUTTING A BIG FOCUS ON.\nTO MARK'S POINT THE MAP HASN'T CHANGED, SHIFTED TOWARD DONALD\nTRUMP BUT HASN'T CHANGED TO THE EXTENT THAT NOW HILLARY CLINTON\nIS IN PANIC MODE. >> HAVING COVERED HANGING CHADS\nAND ALL OF THAT IN 2000. YOU HAVE BEEN AT IT FOR A BIT\nHERE. FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS THIS\nIS UNPRECEDENTED TO SEE SOMEONE FROM THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT\nCOMING OUT AND HAVING AN IMPACT ON A PRESIDENTIAL RACE.\n>> IT IS NOT UNCOMMON TO HAVE POLITICAL FIGURES.\nWHAT IS UNUSUAL IS TO HAVE THE FBI DIRECTOR INJECTING HIMSELF\nAT THE VERY LAST MINUTE. NOW TWO WEEKS AGO OR NINE DAYS\nAGO IT WAS ANTI-CLINTON. NOW A PRO CLINTON ANNOUNCEMENT.\nTHIS IS NOT HOW THE FBI OPERATES.\nONE OF THE BIGGER STORIES THAT'S GOTTEN SWEPT UP IN ALL OF THIS\nIS THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. THIS IS THE FIRST ELECTION SINCE\nTHE VOTING RIGHTS ACT HAS BEEN DESTROYED BY THE UNITED STATES\nSUPREME COURT IN 2013. ONE OF THE REASONS WHY YOU MIGHT\nSEE A SMALLER AFRICAN-AMERICAN TURN OUT ESPECIALLY IN EARLY\nVOTING IN NORTH CAROLINA IS REPUBLICAN LEGISLATURES HAVE\nLIMITED EARLY VOTING. THEY ARE ALLOWED TO DO IT\nBECAUSE THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT NO LONGER APPLIES.\nOTHER LEGAL ISSUES HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON HOW THIS ELECTION IS\nUNFOLDING. >> THANK YOU, EVERYONE.\nI APPRECIATE IT. STAY WITH CNN FOR ALL DAY\nCOVERAGE ON ELECTION DAY. EVERY RACE ACROSS THE COUNTRY\nSTARTS ON TUESDAY. WHEN WE COME BACK, THE NEW TRUMP\nTHAT HAS ONE SENATOR SAYING IT'S NOT JUST A DOG WHISTLE.\nIT'S A GERMAN SHEPHERD WHISTLE.", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1478498933077.1478493401420.fcd80d34-26de-425e-a7fb-58e396c0dc03.segment0.thumb.jpg", "channel": "202"}, {"start": 0, "length": 613042.0, "end": 613042, "date": 1478500620207, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1478503495262.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1478500617140-ef777fcb-bb19-4ebf-879e-a6495a4e8f1d-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=0.00,613.04", "text": "TONIGHT.\nREALLY, NO, TS MORNING, 1:00 A.M. IN LEESBURG, VIRGINIA.\nJIM, THANK YOU. LET'S DISCUSS ALL OF THIS.\nCNN SUPERINTENDENT SUNLEN SERFATY AND BRIAN SELTZER AND\nHOST OF RELIABLE SOURCES. I THINK HE HAS BEEN AWAKE FOR 24\nHOURS STRAIGHT SINCE HIS LIVE SHOW THIS MORNING.\nIN WASHINGTON, D.C., LAURA COATS, CNN LEGAL ANALYST AND\nFORMER LEGAL PROSECUTOR. AND IN CALIFORNIA LANHEE CHEN, A\nREPUBLICAN NOT SUPPORTING DONALD TRUMP.\nTHANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. AND LAURA, LET ME BEGIN WITH YOU\nAS THE LEGAL VOICE IN ALL OF THIS.\nIS IT ODD TO YOU THAT COMEY OPTED NOT TO HAVE THE FBI, NOT\nTO GET THAT WARRANT TO REVIEW ALL THESE E-MAILS IF THEY COULD\nDO IT RELATIVELY QUICKLY, AS THEY DID, PRIOR TO SENDING THE\nINITIAL LETTER TO CONGRESS NINE DAYS AGO.\nOR DO YOU THINK THAT HE WAS SO FEARFUL THAT THIS WOULD GET\nPOLITICIZED, THAT THE WARRANT NEWS WOULD LEAK, AND THEN HE\nWOULD LOOK LIKE HE WAS NOT FORTHCOMING ENOUGH.\n>> POPPY, EVERYTHING ABOUT COMEY'S ACTION CAN BE CLASSIFIED\nAS ODD HERE. WHAT IS PARTICULARLY ODD ABOUT\nCOMEY'S ACTIONS HERE IS, YES, IF IT COULD HAVE BEEN REVIEWED IN\nTHIS VERY EXPEDITED WAY THAT IT HAS BEEN, THEN WHY NOT GIVE THE\nINFORMATION THAT WAS ALREADY CONCLUDED BY THE FBI BEFORE\nGIVING THE LETTER TO CONGRESS. BECAUSE REMEMBER, A LETTER TO\nCONGRESS WAS SENT AS A MEANS TO UPDATE THEM BASED ON HIS\nTESTIMONY IN JULY. BUT HE DIDN'T ACTUALLY INFORM\nTHEM OF ANYTHING. HE SAID I MAY HAVE SOMETHING FOR\nYOU. I HAVEN'T BOTHERED TO LOOK AT IT\nYET. NOW WE HAVE THE CONCLUSION.\nAND WE'RE ABLE TO SEE WHERE WE'RE JUST BACK WHERE WE\nSTARTED, WHICH IS THAT THE FBI WILL NOT RECOMMEND CHARGES\nAGAINST HILLARY CLINTON IN THIS CASE.\nREMEMBER, POPPY, THE FINAL DISCRETION LIES WITH THE\nDEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE, NOT\nWITH THE FBI DIRECTOR. AND SO I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY\nRIGHT. HIS DECISION MAKING WAS BASED\nMORE ON HIS DECISION TO BE OBJECTIVE IN TRYING TO PROVE\nTHAT HE WAS OBJECTIVE THAN IT HAD TO DO WITH WHAT THE FBI\nSHOULD HAVE DONE. >> I THINK DAVID AXELROD PUT IT\nREALLY CLEARLY TONIGHT WHEN HE SAID ESSENTIALLY HE WAS DOING\nEVERYTHING TO UPHOLD THE INTEGRITY OF THE BUREAU, ET\nCETERA. AND IT ENDED UP CRUMBLING,\nFRANKLY. >> IT DID.\n>> SUNLEN, LET ME GO TO YOU. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT THIS\nHAS DONE TO CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN, WE'RE NOT GOING TO KNOW UNTIL\nTUESDAY NIGHT, WEDNESDAY MORNING.\nBUT THEIR INTERNAL POLLING WITHIN THE CLINTON CAMP SHOWS IT\nHAS HURT THEM AMONG SOME INDEPENDENTS AND REPUBLICAN\nWOMEN WHO HAD STRAYED AWAY FROM DONALD TRUMP, COME TO HER SIDE\nAND THEN LEFT HER SIDE AFTER THIS COMEY LETTER.\nTHIS DAMAGE THAT IS IRREPARABLE, AT LEAST IN PART?\n>> WELL, IT ABSOLUTELY COULD BE. FIRST AND FOREMOST, THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN, THERE IS A SENSE OF RELIEF WITHIN THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN. BUT THERE IS ALSO A SENSE AMONG\nPEOPLE VERY CLOSE TO THE CAMPAIGN THAT THE DAMAGE IS\nDONE. THAT IS NOTHING THAT CAN BE\nUNDONE. THAT IT'S A WOUND THAT CANNOT BE\nHEALED IN THE FEW HOURS BEFORE ELECTION DAY.\nTHAT WAS TEN DAYS AGO, SUCH A CRITICAL TIME IN THIS CAMPAIGN\nWHEN PEOPLE WERE HEADING TO THE POLLS FOR EARLY VOTES IN STATES\nTHAT HAVE THAT, WHEN PEOPLE WERE MAKING UP THEIR MIND.\nWHEN THEY THOUGHT MAYBE SOME REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS WHO\nCOULDN'T STOMACH DONALD TRUMP COULD BE PERSUADED TO THEIR\nSIDE. AND THIS MIGHT HAVE TALKED HIM\nOUT OF THAT. THAT WAS REALLY BAKED INTO THE\nPOLITICAL ETHER AT THAT CRITICAL TIME.\nIT ALSO HANDED DONALD TRUMP IN THESE LAST FEW DAYS AND LAST\nWEEK AN ESSENTIAL BURST OF MOMENTUM.\nHE HAD SUDDENLY A GOOD TALKING POINT THAT HE COULD LATCH ON TO.\nTHAT'S NOT STUFF THAT YOU CAN UNDO IN 24 HOURS BEFORE ELECTION\nDAY. >> BRIAN, HERE WE ARE, IT'S 1:00\nIN THE MORNING MONDAY. AND THAT IS THE NEWS THAT BREAKS\nTODAY, TWO DAYS OUT. BUT I JUST WONDER.\nYOU'RE A MEDIA EXPERT, A WIZ. HOW DOES THIS PLAY?\nIS THIS WHAT GETS THE ATTENTION IN THE FINAL STRETCH, OR DOES\nTHIS GET MORE BURIED THAN THE INITIAL COMEY LETTER THAT WAS\nCOVERED A NAUSEAM FOR A WEEK. >> THERE IS PROBABLY A REALITY\nTHAT FEWER AMERICANS WILL HEAR ABOUT THE FOLLOW-UP THAN THE\nLETTER. IS THERE ANYONE LESS POPULAR\nTHAN JAMES COMEY? THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THRILLED A\nWEEK AGO ARE ANGRY. AND VICE VERSA.\n>> MAYBE THESE TWO CANDIDATES. >> DONALD TRUMP WAS SAYING YOU\nCAN CHANGE YOUR VOTE. IF YOU'VE ALREADY VOTED, YOU CAN\nCHANGE YOUR VOTE IN DIFFERENT STATES.\nNOW IS HE GOING TO BACK AWAY FROM THAT KIND OF RHETORIC.\nBUT I DON'T THINK THIS MATTERS MUCH FOR TURNOUT ON TUESDAY AS\nSOME OF THE OTHER THINGS WE'RE SEEING IN THE COMING HOURS.\nTHE KHAN FAMILY REEMERGING WITH THE CLINTONS, COMING OUT WITH A\nWEB VIDEO AND THINGS LIKE THAT. THE BIG RALLY HELD LATER TODAY\nWITH BILL CLINTON. THOSE KIND OF VISUALS WILL\nULTIMATELY MATTER MORE FOR TURNOUT.\n>> AND HER TEAM IS MAKING THE CONSCIOUS CHOICE NOT TO TALK\nABOUT THIS. NOT TO HAVE HER TALK ABOUT IT ON\nTHE STUMP. THEY DON'T WANT HER CLOSING\nHOURS TO BE ABOUT HER E-MAILS AGAIN.\n>> AND THE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS THAT STILL EXIST THERE ARE A LOT\nOF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LETTER. JUST BECAUSE CLINTON MIGHT NOT\nBE IN THE CLEAR, DOESN'T MEANT OTHER STAFFERS ARE.\nA LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT. >> IF THEY FIND OTHER DEVICES,\nTHAT COULD RAISE THIS ALL AGAIN. >> YEAH.\n>> LONIE, LET ME ASK YOU. REGARDLESS OF WHO WINS ON\nTUESDAY, CAN FBI DIRECTOR COMEY SURVIVE?\n>> I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT, REGARDLESS OF WHO\nWINS. IF IT'S HILLARY CLINTON, YOU\nKNOW, I THINK FIRST OF ALL, THERE IS SOME BAGGAGE THERE.\nBUT SECOND OF ALL, THERE WILL BE A STRONG DESIRE FOR HER TO PUT\nIN PLACE LEADERS OF HER ADMINISTRATION THAT IN MANY\nCASES ARE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE IN PRESIDENT OBAMA'S\nADMINISTRATION. AND CERTAINLY FOR DONALD TRUMP,\nLOOK, I THINK HE IS GOING TO HAVE HIS OWN VISION OF\nGOVERNMENT. HE IS PROBABLY GOING TO PUT IN\nPLACE HIS OWN LEADERSHIP AS WELL.\nSO UNFORTUNATELY FOR DIRECTOR COMBEY, THING COULD BE THE END.\nTHE REALITY HERE, THOUGH, POPPY IS I DON'T KNOW THAT HE HAD A\nWHOLE LOT OF OPTION. I THINK HE HAD TO DISCLOSE\nINFORMATION ONCE HE HAD IT. AND IN THIS SITUATION IT ALL\nLOOKED VERY HURRIED. BUT I DO THINK THE FBI DID THE\nBEST IT COULD TO GET THE INFORMATION OUT AS EXPEDITIOUSLY\nAND QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. >> AND HARRY REID WROTE THIS\nLETTER RESPONDING TO THE NEWEST COMEY LETTER TO CONGRESS SAYING\nCOMEY CREATED A POLITICAL FIRESTORM 11 DAYS BEFORE A\nPRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. MERELY TO CONFIRM WHAT WE\nALREADY KNEW, BY CONFIRMING THAT NEW E-MAILS ARE MEANINGLESS,\nTODAY'S LETTER UNDERSCORES THE IRRESPONSIBILITY OF DIRECTOR\nCOMEY'S ORIGINAL LETTER. I WANT EARN TO TAKE A MOMENT AND\nLISTEN TO HOW DONALD TRUMP CHOSE TO HANDLE THIS NEWS, STUMPING\nTODAY IN MICHIGAN. >> RIGHT NOW SHE IS BEING\nPROTECTED BY A RIGGED SYSTEM. IT'S A TOTALLY RIGGED SYSTEM.\nI'VE BEEN SAYING IT FOR A LONG TIME.\nYOU CAN'T REVIEW 650,000 NEW E-MAILS IN EIGHT DAYS.\nYOU CAN'T DO IT, FOLKS. HILLARY CLINTON IS GUILTY.\nSHE NOSE IT. THE FBI KNOWS IT.\nTHE PEOPLE KNOW IT. AND NOW IT'S UP TO THE AMERICAN\nPEOPLE TO DELIVER JUSTICE AT THE BALLOT BOX.\n>> THIS IS A MESSAGE THAT HE KEPT UP IN VIRGINIA, JUST\nMOMENTS AGO IN A SPEECH THAT ENDED JUST BEFORE 1:00 A.M.\nBRIAN STELTER TO YOU. IT WAS RIGGED BEFORE, THEN IT\nWASN'T RIGGED NINE DAYS AGO. NOW IT'S RIGGED AGAIN.\nWHEN YOU TALK ABOUT A RIGGED ELECTION, YOU HAVE BEEN VERY\nVOCAL ABOUT THIS ON YOUR SHOW. THIS IS ABOUT THE ESSENCE OF\nAMERICAN DEMOCRACY, FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS.\nAND HE IS BACK ON RIGGED. >> EVERY TIME I'VE BEEN\nLISTENING TO HIS SPEECHES I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR SIGNS THAT HE\nHAS GOING RETURN TO THE RIGGED ELECTION DAY, THE IDEA OF THE\nELECTION BEING STOLEN FROM HIM. ON THE ONE HAND FROM THE MEDIA\nAND THE ELITES. BUT IF HE TALKS TO TALK MORE\nEXPLICITLY ABOUT VOTER FRAUD, HE COULD BE LAYING THE GROUNDWORK\nTO DELEGITIMIZE THE ELECTION ON TUESDAY NIGHT.\nSO IT'S WORTH LISTENING TO THE STIERNS HINTS IN HIS RHETORIC.\n>> I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT.\nBECAUSE WE HEARD THE CHAIR OF NEVADA'S REPUBLICAN PARTY COMING\nOUT LAST NIGHT AND SAYING HE SAID LAST NIGHT IN CLARK COUNTY,\nTHEY KEPT THE POLLS OPEN UNTIL 10:00 P.M.\nTHE POLLS ARE SUPPOSED TO CLOSE AT 7:00.\nTHIS WAS KEPT OPEN UNTIL 10:00. AND HE WAS SAYING THAT IT WAS TO\nLET, QUOTE, CERTAIN GROUPS VOTE. SUNLEN, INTERESTINGLY, KELLYANNE\nCONWAY, THE LEADER OF TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN WAS ASKED ABOUT THIS.\nAND SHE SAID, YOU KNOW, WELL, IT'S OKAY TO SPECULATE ABOUT\nTHINGS LIKE THIS. I MEAN, IT GETS TO THE ESSENCE.\nANYONE WHO IS STANDING IN LINE WHEN THE POLLS CLOSE IN ANY\nSTATE HAS THE LEGAL RIGHT TO VOTE THAT.\n>> THE RULE. >> THERE IS NO GRAY AREA.\n>> THERE IS NO GRAY AREA. AND THERE HAS BEEN SOME HINTS\nDROPPED BY THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IN SMALL AMOUNTS.\nAND TO PIGGYBACK ON WHAT BRIAN WAS SAYING, I'VE BEEN TO A LOT\nOF TRUMP RALLIES RECENTLY. AND I CAN TELL YOU NOTHING\nCREATES THIS SORT OF CROWD CHEER LIKE THE ELECTION IS RIGGED.\nTHAT IS A LINE THAT WORKS SO WELL WITH HIS SUPPORTERS.\nTHIS IS SOMETHING THAT HE REPEATS AGAIN AND AGAIN.\nAND IN A TIME WHERE DONALD TRUMP NEEDS HIS BASE TO GET OUT AND\nVOTE FOR HIM. THAT'S A LINE THAT IS VERY\nEFFECTIVE. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE\nSEEN HIM REPEATEDLY DOUBLE DOWN, TRIPPING DOWN IN THE DAYS\nLEADING UP TO THE CAMPAIGN. WHETHER THAT'S A LEGITIMATE\nCONCERN FROM THE CAMPAIGN OR A TOOL THAT THEY'RE USING TO HAVE\nPEOPLE ACTUALLY COME OUT AND VOTE, DON'T KNOW.\nBUT CERTAINLY THAT IS LEANING ON IN THIS LATE HOUR.\n>> HE NEEDS PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY MOTIVATED BY THAT.\nHE NEEDS IDEAS AND A FOCUSED VOTERS TO BRIDGE THE GAP.\nGUYS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU'LL BE WITH ME A LITTLE\nLATER. LAURA COATES, LANHEE CHEN.\nSUNLEN SERFATY. STAY WITH CNN UNTIL THE VERY\nLAST VOTE IS CAPPED. WE HAVE A LOT AHEAD FOR YOU IN\nTHIS HOUR IN OUR SPECIAL LIVE EDITION OF NEWSROOM.\nCOMING UP, WE'LL TAKE YOU TO THE SUNSHINE STATES AND ITS CRITICAL\n29 ELECTORAL VOTES. THAT'S WHERE WE FIND NICK\nVALENCIA. >> I'M NICK VALENCIA IN\nTALLAHASSEE, FLORIDA, WHERE EARLY ON SUNDAY EARLY VOTING\nWRAPPED UP HERE IN THE STATE. IT WAS A HISTORIC TURNOUT IN\nLEON COUNTY.

FRANKLY, THEY DO NOT WANT THE\nCANDIDATE TALKING ABOUT THIS. THEY DO NOT WANT E-MAILS TO BE\nOVERSHAD OWING THE LAST TWO DAYS OF HER CAMPAIGNS.\nBUT I WAS STRUCK BY TRUMP'S COMMENT THERE SAYING IT WAS\nIMPOSSIBLE TO REVIEW ALL THE E-MAILS IN SUCH A SHORT PERIOD\nOF TIME. HE KNOWS HOW GOOGLE WORKS, HE\nKNOWS YOU COULD DO A KEY WORD SEARCH, CALCULATED DATABASE\nSEARCHES IN ORDER FIND OUT IF THERE'S DUPLICATE E-MAILS OR IF\nTHERE'S NEW E-MAILS AND FIND OUT WHAT'S IN THEM.\nSO I DO THINK IT MAKES SENSE. THE FBI HAS HUNDREDS OF\nENGINEERS AND PROGRAMMERS. TRUMP'S ARGUMENT THAT IT WAS\nIMPOSSIBLE DOESN'T SEEM TO STAND UP TO SCRUTINY.\n>> IF YOU READ THE \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" YESTERDAY, HE DOESN'T USE\nA COMPUTER AND HE DOESN'T REALLY KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT IT.\nSO MAYBE HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW GOOGLE OR KEY WORD SEARCHES\nWORK. IS THIS BETTER ON BALANCE FOR\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN? WHEN THIS BROKE YESTERDAY, I\nTHOUGHT FOR A SECOND, THIS JUST MAKES E-MAILS A STORY AGAIN FOR\nA FEW HOURS ALBEIT ONE THAT IS BETTER FOR HILLARY CLINTON BUT\nDO YOU THINK THEY WELCOME THIS IN THE LAST 24 HOURS?\n>> ON BALANCE IS DEFINITELY BETTER.\nBRIAN IS RIGHT. THOSE NINE DAYS YOU DON'T GET\nBACK AND ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN THE LAST 72 HOURS OF THE\nCAMPAIGN VERY HARD FOR VOTERS TO ABSORB, LET ME TELL YOU, YOU'D\nBETTER HAVE AN UPPER TRAJECTORY THAN A DOWNWARD ONE.\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN DOES NEED SOMETHING TO SMILE ABOUT AND\nTHEY GOT IT WITH THIS. >> LET ME ASK YOU, DO YOU THINK\nPEOPLE ARE UNDECIDED ARE GOING TO BE SWAYED BY THE FBI\nINVESTIGATION? IS THERE NOT ENOUGH TIME FOR\nPEOPLE TO RUMINATE ON THIS? >> I THINK FOR UNDECIDED\nVOTERS -- IF WE LOOK AT PEOPLE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, THEY\nTRADITIONALLY TAKE THEIR VOTE DOWN TO THE WIRE.\nTHEY ARE GOING INTO THE POLLING PLACE STILL SAYING I'M STILL\nTRYING TO DECIDE WHO I'M VOTING FOR.\nTHIS COULD DEFINITELY MAKE A DIFFERENCE, THAT AND THE CLOSING\nARGUMENT YOU HAVE SEEN FROM SECRETARY CLINTON.\nI DO THINK THERE HAS BEEN A SURGE IN EARLY VOTE NUMBERS AND\nWE KNOW THAT THAT TRADITIONALLY FAVORS SOME DEMOCRATS.\nI THINK I CAN SPEAK FOR EVERYBODY IN AMERICA, I'M\nGLAD -- I'M GOING TO SPEAK FOR ALL OF AMERICA RIGHT NOW, WE\nHAVE PUT THE E-MAILS TO REST. >> NOW THERE'S NO NEED FOR ME TO\nTALK. >> MICHIGAN, PENNSYLVANIA AND\nNEW HAMPSHIRE WHICH ARE ALL KEY STATES EFFECTIVELY HAVE NO EARLY\nVOTING WHICH IS WHERE THIS ARGUMENT COMES DOWN TO.\nDONALD TRUMP SAID THE WHOLE SYSTEM WAS RIGGED BEFOREHAND\nTHEN WHEN COMEY OPENED THE REVIEW, NOT SO RIGGED.\nNOW WE'RE BACK TODAY RIGGING.

THE BEST CASE SCENARIO FOR\nHILLARY CLINTON -- >> SHE JUST SPOKE FOR ALL OF\nAMERICAN. >> THE BEST CASE SCENARIO FOR\nHILLARY CLINTON WOULD BE TO HAVE THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THERE ARE\nNO CHARGES THAT ARE GOING TO BE FILED AND TO WALK BACK THAT\nINITIAL PRESS CONFERENCE WHERE HE ESSENTIALLY WENT OUT THERE\nAND SLAMMED HER.

DONALD TRUMP GOT TO SPEND THE\nLAST NINE DAYS SAYING THINGS LIKE I JUST READ BACK TO YOU,\nTHE PRIME SUSPECT IN A WIDE-REACHING CRIMINAL\nINVESTIGATION. IS IT FAIR TO SAY YOU GUYS GOT\nAN ADVANTAGE HERE BASED ON ACTUALLY NOTHING HAPPENING?\n>> WELL, THAT'S NOT TRUE. SOMETHING DID HAPPEN.\nTHE FBI DIRECTOR SAID HE WAS LAUNCHING A NEW INVESTIGATION OR\nREOPENING THE OLD ONE. I SAW IT TERMED DIFFERENTLY IN\nDIFFERENT PLACES. THAT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH\nUS. OUR CAMPAIGN HASN'T TIPPED ITS\nHAND. WE CERTAINLY DIDN'T, YOU KNOW,\nCRITICIZE HIM AND PERSECUTE HIM THE WAY OTHERS DID, WHICH I\nTHINK IS QUITE REMARKABLE BECAUSE NOW THEY'RE SAYING WE\nKNEW THAT HE WOULDN'T CHANGE HIS CONCLUSION.\nBUT, STEVE, LET'S FAIR AND OPEN ABOUT WHAT ALL HIS CONCLUSIONS\nWERE THAT WILL NOT BE CHANGED. THOSE CONCLUSIONS INCLUDE THE\nFACT THAT SHE WAS RECKLESS AND CARELESS, SHE LIED ABOUT THE\nSERVER, SHE LIED ABOUT THE NUMBER OF DEVICES, SHE LIED\nABOUT HAVING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.\nTHE FACT THAT SHE PUT YOURS AND MY SECURITY AT RISK DOES NOT\nCHANGE PIT.

LOOK, FOR ALL THE ADVANTAGES\nTHIS WOMAN HAS, THE MACHINE SHE'S BUILT, THE FACT SHE STARTS\nOUT WITH 240 ELECTORAL VOTES IN SO-CALLED BLUE WALL AND YET SHE\nCAN'T GET THOSE OTHER 22 ELECTORAL VOTES AND WE'RE\nFORCING HER NOW TO DIP INTO THE 248, THEY'RE PLAYING FOLLOW THE\nLEADER WE'RE FORCING THEM ALL OVER HER, THE ELECTORAL MAP\nTODAY, THEY'RE IN MICHIGAN TODAY, WISCONSIN, LIVING IN\nPENNSYLVANIA, LET'S GO BACK TO NEW HAMPSHIRE, ALL BLUE STATES\nTHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA CARRIED TWICE.\nAND IT IS OUR CAMPAIGN THAT HAS THEM ON THE RUN IN THESE STATES.\nTHAT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE. I CAN'T IMAGINE THEY'RE GOING TO\nSAY WE NEED TO GO TO MICHIGAN TODAY.\nWE'LL PROBABLY WIN BECAUSE DIRECTOR COMEY YET AGAIN\nASSERTED HIMSELF INTO THE ELECTORAL PROCESS TODAY NAP\nWON'T CHANGE. THE FACT THAT PEOPLE DON'T TRUST\nTHIS WOMAN AND SHE CAN'T GET ABOVE 50% IN ANY OF THESE STATES\nAND STAY THERE WON'T CHANGE TODAY.\n>> I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT SOME OF THE EARLY REPORTS OF EARLY\nVOTING. I WANT TO ASK YOU SPECIFICALLY\nABOUT THE SWING STATE, WE'VE CONSIDERED IT A SWING STATE OF\nNEVADA, A STATE PRESIDENT OBAMA CARRIED TWICE IN 2008 AND 2012.\nJOHN RALSTON, THE DEAN OF POLITICAL REPORTERS OUT THERE,\nHE IS NOW SAYING ESSENTIALLY THE RACE IN NEVADA IN HIS JUDGMENT\nIS OVER. HE BASES THAT ON SAYING THE\nDEMOCRATS ACTUALLY, THEY WERE MORE THE DEMOCRATIC BALLOT\nADVANTAGE IN EARLY VOTING WAS ACTUALLY BIGGER IN THE EARLY\nVOTING PERIOD THIS YEAR THAN IT WAS FOUR YEARS AGO.\nOF COURSE FOUR YEARS AGO THE STATE WASN'T PARTICULARLY CLOSE.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA CARRIED IT BY A COMFORTABLE MARGIN.\nDO YOU AGREE WITH THAT ASSESSMENT?\nIS NEVADA OFF THE BOARD? >> NEVADA'S NOT -- I THINK IF\nANYBODY LEARNED ANYTHING OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS IS CALLING\nTHINGS OVER MAKES PEOPLE LOOK A LITTLE BIT OVER THEIR SKIS TOO\nEARLY BECAUSE FOR ALL THESE ARTICLES THAT WERE WRITTEN THAT\nTHE RACE ITSELF IS OVER, THE PATH IS GONE, THE PATH IS\nNARROW, IT WILL BE A BLOWOUT, WE'LL GET DEMOCRATS IN THE HOUSE\nAND SENATE, WE'RE GOING TO TURN TEXAS BLUE, ALL THIS NONSENSE\nTHAT PEOPLE JUST WENT AND REPORTED ON THAT IS NOT TRUE, IN\nNEVADA, WE NEED A VERY GOOD DAY OF PERFORMANCE IN NEVADA TO\nCARRY THE STATE AND WE ARE GEARING UP FOR THAT.\nIF YOU LOOK AT OTHER EARLY RETURN STATES LIKE COLORADO,\nCERTAINLY FLORIDA, OHIO, IOWA, AND NORTH CAROLINA WHERE I JUST\nDID AS PRECALL THIS MORNING WHERE WE REPORTED ON THE LATEST\nSTATISTICS, STEVE, WE LIKE WHERE WE ARE AT THIS POINT AS COMPARED\nTO WHERE THE NOMINEE WAS IN 2012 IN TERMS OF ABSENTEE BALLOT\nREQUESTS AND EARLY RETURNS AND THE LIKE.\nAND SO NEVADA IS A PLACE WE ARE GEARING UP.\nWE'VE IMPROVED THIS WEEK BUT WE'RE GEARING UP FOR A REALLY\nGOOD DAY OF PERFORMANCE TO CARRY THE STATE.\nI ALSO WOULD JUST TELL YOU THAT WE HAVE SIX DIFFERENT PATHS NOW\nTO GET TO 270 AND SO YOU SEE THE WAY WE'VE SCRAMBLED UP THE\nELECTORAL MAP. IF THE DEMOCRATS -- IF HILLARY\nCLINTON WEREN'T WORRIED ABOUT IT, SHE WOULDN'T HAVE PRESIDENT\nOBAMA, PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON AND HILLARY CLINTON VISITING THE\nSTATE OF MICHIGAN, FOR EXAMPLE, CLOSING OUT IN PENNSYLVANIA\nTOMORROW NIGHT. SHE IS.\nAND SO WE'VE GOT THEM ON THE RUN.\nTHEY HAVE DECIDED TO GO BACK INTO BLUE STATES WITH PAID\nADVERTISEMENTS AND CERTAINLY DEPLOYING HER SUPER SURROGATES,\nALL MORE POPULAR THAN SHE IS, AND HER HERSELF GOING THERE AS\nWELL BECAUSE THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT THESE BLUE STATES.\n>> KELLYANNE CONWAY, DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER, THANKS\nFOR TAKING A FEW MINUTES. >> THANK YOU, STEVE.\n>> MEANWHILE, DONALD TRUMP SPEAKING IN MINNEAPOLIS,\nMINNESOTA. HE HAS NOT YET IN THIS SPEECH\nADDRESSED THE BREAKING NEWS.

KATY TUR, KELLYANNE CONWAY IS\nBASELY GOING BACK TO THE DOUBTS THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WAS TRYING TO\nRAISE BASED ON WHAT JAMES COMEY SAID IN JULY.\nSHE ACTED RECKLESSLY, INAPPROPRIATELY.\nIT SEEMS IN TERMS OF THE LAST NINE DAYS DONALD TRUMP MAY HAVE\nGOTTEN A POLITICAL ADVANTAGE IN FROM THAT NEWS NINE DAYS AGO\nTHAT NOW NOT ADDING UP TO MUCH. >> CERTAINLY THEY COULD HAVE\nFOCUSED ON A LOT OF INNUENDO AND THEY WANTED TO PUT OUT THAT\nHILLARY CLINTON WOULD LIKELY BE FACING INDICTMENT, SHE WAS\nSOMEBODY WHO WOULD BE UNDER CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION, WHICH IS\nWORDS THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS USED.\nAND THEY POINTED TO THIS REVIVAL OF THE FBI INVESTIGATION AS\nPROOF OF THAT. IT WAS A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY FOR\nTHEM THAT WAS HANDED TO THEM NINE DAYS AGO.\nIT WAS WHAT THE GOP SAID WOULD ENABLE HIM TO GAIN SOME GROUND,\nTO REGAIN HIS FOOTING, TO GIRD THOSE DOWN-BALLOT CANDIDATES\nTHAT WERE FACING VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES IN THEIR OWN\nRACES. SENATORS LIKE KELLY AYOTTE AND\nPAT TOOMEY AND MARCO RUBIO. INSTEAD OF THEM HAVING TO\nRESPOND TO DONALD TRUMP'S LATEST OUTVA JOUS STATEMENTS, SAYING\nTHEY HAD TO RESPOND TO WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHE IDEA THIS HASN'T BEEN A FOCUS OF THEIR CAMPAIGN IS JUST\nNOT TRUE. DONALD TRUMP TALKS ABOUT IT AT\nEVERY SINGLE RALLY. IT'S PART OF THEIR LARGER\nNARRATIVE THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS NOT FIT TO DO THE JOB, NOT\nTRUSTWORTHY AND IS OUT FOR HERSELF AND CORRUPT.\n>> WAS THERE A STRATEGIC CHOICE -- IT SEEMS THERE WAS A\nSTRATEGIC CHOICE BY THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WHEN THE NEWS BROKE\nTHAT, YES, DONALD TRUMP WOULD ADDRESS IT AND TALK ABOUT IT AND\nBRING IT UP. BUT THEY WANTED THE FREE MEDIA\nEFFECT OF THIS. SO HE WAS NOT GOING TO PRESS IT\nAS AGGRESSIVELY AS HE HAD BEFORE.\n>> MAYBE NOT AS AGGRESSIVELY IN TERMS OF GETTING ON TWITTER\nEVERY DAY AND POINTING IT OUT AND SPENDING THE ENTIRE RALLY ON\nIT. THEY DID -- IF YOU LOOK AT \"THE\nNEW YORK TIMES\" ARTICLE TODAY ABOUT THE MOMENTS LEADING UP TO\nWHAT THEY WERE DOING WHEN THEY FIRST DECIDED TO RESPOND TO THE\nFBI REVOOISM THEY WERE WRESTLING OVER HOW TO DO IT, HOW TO BEST\nCAPITAL EISEN IT. THEY WERE ADAMANT WITH DONALD\nTRUMP THAT HE NEEDS TO LET THE STORY PLAY OUT FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON. HE STAYED ON MESSAGE, STAYED\nPRETTY CONTROLLED IN THE LAST NINE DAYS.\nBUT IT HAS BEEN QUITE A CENTERPIECE OF HIS RALLIES.\nHE TALKS ABOUT IT ALMOST EVERY DAY.\nHE TALKS ABOUT IT AS PART OF A LARGER NARRATIVE.\nIT HELPED THEM PAINT TA PICTURE. IT HELPED THEM GAIN MORE SUPPORT\nWITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. IT'S PROBABLY A GOOD REASON WHY\nTHEY ARE IN MICHIGAN RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THEY WERE ABLE TO FIND\nMORE REPUBLICANS THAT COME TO THEIR SIDE IN ADDITION TO THIS\nJOBS MESSAGE THAT THE CAMPAIGN SAYS IS RESONATING SO WELL IN\nTHE UPPER MIDWEST. SO THEY HAVE CERTAINLY USED THIS\nTO THEIR ADVANTAGE, AND I FIND IT TO BE INTERESTING CERTAINLY\nTHAT THE CAMPAIGN IS NOW TRYING TO PAINT THE FBI AS SOMEHOW\nBEING IN THE WRONG HERE OR POTENTIALLY NOT HANDLING THIS\nINVESTIGATION CORRECTLY BECAUSE THEY WERE SO HAPPY WITH THE FBI\nFOR THIS PAST NINE DAYS. >> I GET DIZZY FROM BOTH\nCAMPAIGNS CHANGING THEIR MINDS ON HOW THE FBI HAS CONDUCTED\nITSELF. HALLE, WE SAW THIS ESPECIALLY\nTHAT DAILY TRACKING POLL FROM ABC NEWS AND \"THE WASHINGTON\nPOST\" THAT'S BEEN ALL OVER THE PLACE.\nONE THING WE SAW WAS IN THE 24 HOURS AFTER COMEY MADE THAT\nANNOUNCEMENT NINE DAYS AGO THAT THERE WERE NEW E-MAILS YOU SAW\nREALLY IN THAT POLL A COLLAPSE FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nPART OF IT WAS ENTHUSIASM FOR DEMOCRATS.\nYOU TRUMP ACTUALLY TAKE THE LEAD.\nI'M WONDERING NOW, THOUGH, LOOK, THERE'S STILL TWO DAYS LEFT.\nTHERE HAVE BEEN EARLY VOTES CAST BETWEEN THEN AND NOW, BUT THERE\nARE STILL A LOT OF VOTES TO BE CAST.\nIS THIS A LAST-MINUTE BOUNCE FOR HILLARY CLINTON?\n>> POTENTIALLY. THE ARGUMENT COULD BE THE DAMAGE\nHAS BEEN DONE. DONALD TRUMP DISCUSSING IT AT\nRALLIES AND HE HITS THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT MORE AT\nTHESE RALLY, MAKES OTHER ARGUMENTS AND TIES IT INTO HIS\nARGUMENT THAT CLINTON IS TOO CORRUPT TO BE PRESIDENT.\nTHERE COULD BE A BOUNCE. THIS VALIDATE WHAT IS DEMOCRATS\nHAVE BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG. WE'RE GETTING SOME HINTS NOT\nJUST FROM NEWT GINGRICH WHO SAYS HE BELIEVES COMEY HAS CAVED TO\nPOLITICAL PRESSURE BUT THERE'S A NEW INBOX FROM PAUL RYAN,\nREGARDLESS OF THIS DECISION, UNDISPUTED FINDING OF THE FBI\nINVESTIGATION IS THAT SECRETARY CLINTON PUT OUR NATION'S SECRETS\nAT RISK AND IN DOING SO COMPROMISED OUR NATIONAL\nSECURITY. HE END THE STATEMENT SAYING\nLET'S BRING THE CLINTON ERA TO AN END BY VOTING FOR DONALD\nTRUMP ON TUESDAY. WE DON'T OFTEN HEAR RYAN TALK\nSPECIFICALLY ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. HE WHO SHALL NOT BE NAMED.\nIT'S NOTABLE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THIS STATEMENT.\nA PUSH NOW, REPUBLICANS GETTING BEHIND TRUMP FOR THESE LAST 48\nHOURS TO TRY TO GET THEM OVER THE FINISH LINE.\n>> I SAID DIZZY FROM THESE TWO CAMPAIGNS CHANGING THEIR MINDS.\nYOU SAID NEWT GINGRICH SAID THE FBI DIRECTOR CAVED TO ENORMOUS\nPOLITICAL PRESSURE. HIS WORLDS NOW.\nNINE DAYS AGO WHEN THIS HAPPENED HILLARY CLINTON'S WORDS ABOUT\nCOMEY, SHE SAID HE BOWED TO PARTISAN PRESSURE.\nUSING THE SAME TERMINOLOGY DEPENDING IT CHANGES ON THE\nSITUATION. >> DON'T FORGET THAT STEVE COHEN\nNINE DAYS AGO WAS ONE OF THE DEMOCRATS WHO WERE RIGHT ON THE\nFRONT LINES CALLING FOR COMEY'S HEAD MORE OR LESS.\nYOU HAVE TO WONDER WHAT IS THE REACTION GOING TO BE FROM\nMEMBERS OF CONGRESS, SPECIFICALLY DEMOCRATS?\nARE WE GOING TO SEE THE", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1478474349333.1478468640622.114128ba-f109-4fd0-ab12-358d8cca52b5.segment0.thumb.jpg", "channel": "356"}, {"start": 617408, "length": 417250.0, "end": 1034658, "date": 1478468643303, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1478474338524.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1478468640622-114128ba-f109-4fd0-ab12-358d8cca52b5-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=617.41,1034.66", "text": "FLIP-FLOP-FLIP FROM SOME FOLKS?\n>>> I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED.

THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE\nHEADLINE OF THE 4:00 HOUR. SHE'S GOT A RALLY WITH LeBRON\nJAMES, WITH THE KING IN CLEVELAND.\nNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE LATEST TWIST IN THIS E-MAIL\nSAGA. ARE WE EXPECTING HILLARY CLINTON\nTO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THIS WHEN SHE APPEARS WITH LeBRON JAMES?\n>> Reporter: WELL, WE HAVE NOT BEEN GIVEN AN INDICATION FROM\nTHE CAMPAIGN ABOUT THAT. BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE\nCAMPAIGN HAS BELIEVED OVER RECENT DAYS THAT THIS ISSUE WAS\nNOT MAKING A BIG DIFFERENCE IN POLL NUMBERS.\nI THINK THERE'S GREATER URGENCY FOR HER TO BE TALKING ABOUT\nGETTING OUT THE VOTE AND NOT REINTRODUCING WHAT HAS BEEN A\nCOMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT TOPIC FOR CAMPAIGN THROUGHOUT.\nSO IT'S LIKE WOULD HILLARY CLINTON WANT TO GET NEGATIVE\nONLY TO SAY THAT COMEY HAS RESOLVED IT.\nMAYBE WE'LL SEE. IT IS GOOD NEWS IN THE SENSE OF\nSHE CAN SAY IT'S REALLY BEHIND HER IN THIS FINAL TURN, THIS\nFINAL WEEKEND. MY HOPES IS SHE'LL WANT TO BE\nMORE IN THE MOMENT HERE IN A KEY STATE, ONE OF THE BIGGEST STARS\nLOCALLY IN SPORT AND A HOMETOWN HERE HOE HERE THAT COULD BRING\nTHE CHAMPIONSHIP OF THE FINAL YEARS TO TOWN.\nI WOULD IMAGINE THERE WILL BE SOME SPORTS METAPHORS ON DISPLAY\nHERE. AND SHE NEEDS TO DRIVE THE BOAT.\nEARLIER IN SOME OF THE SPEAKER WHO IS COME UP TO THE STAGE\nBEFORE THE MAIN EVENT, WE HEARD THAT ABOUT GETTING TO THE\nPOLLING PLACES THAT ARE OPENING TODAY FOR EARLY VOTING,\nENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE.\nSO WHAT IS GOOD NEWS IN THE KIND OF BIG PICTURE OF THIS MAY NOT\nBE AS APT TO BE USED IN THIS PARTICULAR SETTING. WE'LL HAVE TO SEE.\nIT WOULD HAVE TO BE A GAME TIME DECISION FOR THOSE ADVISERS.\nI WOULD IMAGINE THEY'D WANT TO REVIEW ALL THE SPECIFICS OF WHAT\nDIRECTOR COMEY SAID. YOU GET MY POINT ABOUT EVEN\nCATCHING THEIR BREATH ON THIS. THEY MAY NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT\nE-MAILS ANY MORE THIS CLOSE TO TUESDAY.\nAT LEAST FROM SECRETARY CLINTON'S OWN MOUTH AND FROM TOP\nSOURCES LIKE THIS. >> KELLY O'DONNELL OUT THERE IN\nCLEVELAND. AGAIN, THAT CLINTON RALLY\nEXPECTED TO GET UNDER WAY SOMETIME THIS HOUR.\nLeBRON JAMES HEADLINED THAT WITH THE CANDIDATE.\nKASIE HUNT WHO FIRST BROKE THIS STORY NINE DAYS AGO JOINS US\nNOW. A WHIRL WIND NINE DAYS, STARTS\nWITH JAMES COMEY TAKING THE ENTIRE POLITICAL WORLD BY\nSURPRISE ON OCTOBER 28th SAYING, WHOA, WE FOUND NEW E-MAILS HERE\nSUGGESTING ALL SORTS OF POSSIBILITIES THAT HAVE BEEN\nREPORTED ON OVER THE LAST NINE DAYS.\nNOW PUTTING AN END TO THIS PHASE OF THE E-MAIL STORY.\nTHE POTENTIAL POLITICAL DAMAGE DONE TO HILLARY CLINTON THESE\nLAST NINE DAYS. HOW DO YOU CATALOG THAT?\n>> YEAH, STEVE. IT'S REMARKABLE REALLY.\nBRIAN FALLON, THE SPOKESMAN FOR HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN, JUST\nTWEETED THAT WE'RE GLAD THIS ISSUE IS RESOLVED BUT FOR THE\nRECORD IT COULD HAVE BEEN LEARNED BEFORE THE FIRST LETTER\nWAS SEPTEMBER TO THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN POSITION HERE THAT,\nHEY, YES, THEY SENT THIS FIRST LETTER BUT WHY DIDN'T THEY DO\nTHE WORK ALONG THESE LINES BEFORE THEY SENT THAT LETTER\nTHAT OBVIOUSLY WOULD NEVER LIKELY HAVE COME TO LIGHT IF\nTHEY HAD HANDLED IT THAT WAY. I THINK FOR THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN, THEY'VE BEEN VERY FOCUSED THE LAST NINE DAYS ON\nTRYING TO SAY AND ARGUE THAT THE TIGHTENING IN THE POLLS THAT\nWE'VE SEEN OVER THE COURSE OF THESE FINAL WEEKS HAS NOTHING TO\nDO WITH THIS FBI LETTER AND WITH, YOU KNOW, THE REMINDERS\nTHAT EVERY, YOU KNOW, UNDECIDED VOTER GOT ABOUT HOW HILLARY\nCLINTON HAD HANDLED HER PRIVATE E-MAIL AND HER PRIVATE E-MAIL\nSERVER. THEY SAY IT WAS HAPPENING\nEARLIER BEFORE THIS -- INITIALLY BEFORE THIS BROKE AND I THINK,\nTHOUGH, THAT THE REALITY IS IT REALLY CHANGED THE TENOR OF\nHILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN. THE WEEK BEFORE IT WAS\nHAPPENING, I WAS TRAVELING WITH THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN.\nYOU COULD NOT FIND ANYONE WHO HAD A BAD WORD TO SAY WHAT WAS\nGOING ON. THE STAFF WERE KIND OF PRIVATELY\nTALKING ABOUT WHERE THEY WERE GOING TO LIVE IN WASHINGTON,\nD.C., ONCE SHE WAS ELECTED. AND THEN OF COURSE THE ENTIRE\nKIND OF MOOD CHANGED DRAMATICALLY AND WENT TO ONE\nTHAT HAS REALLY FELT LIKE IT WAS BASICALLY GRIM DETERMINATION.\nTHEY TRUST IN THE MACHINE THAT THEY HAVE BUILT TO GET OUT THEIR\nVOTE AND THEY'RE STARTING TO SEE THAT PILE UM IN THESE EARLY VOTE\nRETURNS. BUT, YOU KNOW, THIS IS NOT\nFAILING TO THE PRESIDENCY THE WAY THEY WERE HOPING, NOT THE\nEND THEY WERE PARTICIPATING. THEY ARE FINDING THEMSELVES ON\nDEFENSE IN UP EXPECTED PLACES, NAMELY IN MICHIGAN, WHERE DONALD\nTRUMP'S CAMPAIGN IS MAKING THIS LAST-MINUTE PLAY.\nWHEN YOU TALK TO AIDES ABOUT THAT THEY'LL SAY WE DON'T\nUNDERSTAND WHY HE DIDN'T GO INTO MICHIGAN EARLIER.\nTHE DEMOCRATS WILL SAY IT'S TAILOR MADE FOR TRUMP.\nBUT THIS NEWS COMBINED WITH DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN'S NEW\nEFFORTS SENDING HIM THERE HAS CAUSED SOME DEMOCRATS TO RAISE\nALARM ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE STATE.\nSO IF THERE ARE ANY SURPRISES ON TUESDAY NIGHT, IT'S GOING TO BE\nHARD NOT TO TIE THEM TO THIS LATE-BREAKING OCTOBER AND NOW\nNOVEMBER SURPRISE. NOW, I DO THINK THAT THIS NEW\nLETTER FROM COMEY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CHANGE THE MOOD IN\nTHE FINAL DAYS HERE FOR HILLARY CLINTON, AND I'M INTERESTED TO\nSEE HOW SHE AS A CANDIDATE RESPONDS.\nI THINK, YOU KNOW, WE SAW HER VERY UPBEAT.\nSHE HELD THESE AVAILABILITIES. THEY'VE CAMPAIGNED TOGETHER.\nTHE TWO SEEM TO BE RIDING HIGH. WE HAVEN'T SEEN AS MUCH OF HER\nDIRECTLY ASIDE FROM THAT ONE PRISS CONFERENCE IN IOWA AFTER\nTHE INITIAL LETTER CAME OUT NINE DAYS AGO.\nSINCE THEN WE HAVEN'T SEEN HER. IT'S HARD TO COMPARE HOW SHE'S\nFEELING. BUT I'M INTERESTED TO SEE IF\nTHAT CHANGES IN THE FINAL 24, 48 HOURS.\n>> KASIE HUNT, THANKS FOR THAT. AGAIN, WE ARE KEEPING OUR EYE ON\nTHAT STAGE OUT IN CLEVELAND. HILLARY CLINTON'S EXPECD THERE\nANY MINUTE. SO IS LeBRON JAMES.\nTHE STAR OF THE NBA CHAMPION CLEVELAND CLEARS GOING TO BE\nJOINING HILLARY CLINTON IN A CRUCIAL SWING STATE FOR A\nLAST-MINUTE RALLY. WE'LL HAVE MUCH MORE, OBVIOUSLY\nFOLLOWING ALL THE REACTION AS IT COMES INTO THIS LATEST FBI NEWS\nSAYING THEIR REVIEW OF RECENTLY DISCOVERED ESHG MAILS IS NOW\nOVER.

THIS IS BIGGER THAN WATERGATE.\nTHIS IS BIGGER. THAN WATERGATE.\nIN MY OPINION. >> THAT WAS NINE DAYS AGO.\nDONALD TRUMP IN NEW HAMPSHIRE REACTING TO WHAT WE CALL THE\nOCTOBER SURPRISE. THAT WAS THE THE NEWS NINE DAYS\nAGO THAT FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY HAD WRITTEN A LETTER TO\nCONGRESS SAYING E-MAILS POSSIBLY LINKED TO HILLARY CLINTON'S\nSERVER HAD BEEN FOUND ON A PRIVATE LAPTOP BELONGING TO\nANTHONY WEINER AND HUMA ABEDIN. NINE DAYS LATER A VERY DIFFERENT\nSTORY WITH SECOND LET TORE CONGRESS FROM FBI DIRECTORY\nJAMES COMEY. LET'S BRING IN SENIOR EDITOR OF\nPOLITICS NBC NEWS. TERESA KUMAR, MSNBC PRESIDENT --\nCONTRIBUTOR. WE HAD THE PRESIDENT OF NBC,\nTHAT WOULD BE INTERESTING. PRESIDENT AND CEO AND MSNBC\nCONTRIBUTOR AND FOUNDER OF \"WASHINGTON POST\" \"THE FIX\"\nCHRIS CILLIZZA. BETH, THE NEWS BROKE NINE DAYS\nAGO. DONALD TRUMP HAD A RALLY.\nAS YOU JUST SAW HE LED THE RALLY WITH WHAT HE SAW AS BREAKING\nNEWS. HE A RALLY THIS AFTERNOON AFTER\nTHE SECOND LETTER WITH JAMES COMEY CAME OUT DID NOT LEAD THE\nRALLY WITH NEWS. DOES THIS TAKE THE WIND OUT OF\nTHE SAILS IN THE FINAL DAYS OF THE CAMPAIGN OR IS THE DAMAGE\nDONE WITH HILLARY CLINTON. >> I THINK A LITTLE OF BOTH.\nHE HAD A GREAT RUN, PUT HILLARY ON THE DEFENSIVE AFTER A STRONG\nOCTOBER, MOST OF OCTOBER. BUT THINGS HAVE BEEN PETERING\nOUT A LITTLE BIT. WE'VE SEEN HIM FLYING ALL OVER\nTHE PLACE WITH NO APPARENT STRATEGY LINING UP 270 ELECTORAL\nVOTES HE NEEDS. YOU SAID HE WAS IN MINNESOTA\nGIVING AN ADDRESS. WHAT DOES HE DO IN MINNESOTA.\nTHAT STATE NEVER IN PLAY, NEVER HAS BEEN.\nTHEY HAVE GOTTEN A LITTLE SENSE OF DESPERATION AND RANDOMNESS IN\nHOW THEY ARE APPROACHING FINAL DAYS.\nTHIS DID TAKE EVEN MORE ENERGY AWAY FROM HIM, THIS REVELATION.\nHOWEVER, THE DAMAGE DEFINITELY IS DONE.\nWE SAW THIS LAST WEEK. HILLARY CLINTON WAS NOT THE SAME\nKIND OF BUOYANT, UPBEAT, READY FOR VICTORY CANDIDATE THAT WE'D\nSEEN EVEN JUST A DAY OR TWO BEFORE.\nSHE'S JUST GRINDING IT OUT, GRINDING IT OUT, TRYING TO GET\nTO THE END OF THIS. WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS TUESDAY.\nSHE'S FAVORED IN OUR NATIONAL TRACKING POLL, \"WASHINGTON\nPOST.\" IT'S NOT THE SAME KIND OF\nBUOYANT END SHE HAD HOPED FOR. >> MARIA, CAN YOU SEE THE VOTER,\nIS THERE A PROFILE OF VOTER TODAY WHO GETS THIS NEWS AND WAS\nTORN BETWEEN THE TWO WITH CLINTON -- WAS WITH TRUMP AND\nNOW WITH CLINTON. DOES THIS MOVE PEOPLE AT THE\nEND. >> THIS HAPPENED, HAD HE COME\nOUT FIVE DAYS BEFORE EARLY VOTING, YES.\nA LOT OF EARLY VOTING HAS ALREADY TAKEN PLACE.\nI THINK PEOPLE RIGHT NOW AS BETH MENTIONED WANT IT TO BE\nWEDNESDAY. THEY WANT TUESDAY TO BE OVER SO\nTHEY CAN GO BACK TO THEIR LIVES. THEY ARE ALREADY BAKED IN.\nTHE DIFFICULTY IF YOU SAW MIKE PENCE, MIKE PENCE TODAY EVEN\nTHOUGH THIS CAME OUT WITH COMEY HE WAS DOUBLING DOWN SAYING NOT\nTRUSTWORTHY. THOSE PEOPLE SOLID IN THE TRUMP\nCAMP. THE FACT HE'S GOING AROUND THE\nCOUNTRY SPEAKS MORE TO THE FACT HE DOESN'T HAVE ORGANIZATION,\nDOESN'T HAVE A GROUND GAME WITH RNC.\nTHERE WAS RECENTLY AN ARTICLE THAT CAME OUT THIS MORNING THAT\nSAID FOLKS IN RNC YOU WORK ALL NIGHT AND WORK ON A CAMPAIGN,\nTHEY ARE LEAVING AT 5:00 GOING TO HAPPY HOUR LIKE THEY WANT IT\nTO BE DONE. >> CHRIS, LET ME ASK YOU.\nI THINK THIS WAS IN YOUR POLL \"WASHINGTON POST\" DAILY NEWS\nTRACKING POLL WHEN THAT FIRST LETTER WAS WRITTEN BY COMEY NINE\nDAYS AGO, THE NEXT DAY IT LOOKED LIKE IN THAT POLL THE BOTTOM\nFELL OUT FOR HILLARY CLINTON. MORE RECENTLY IT SORT OF\nSTABILIZED. BUT I'M WONDERING IF THERE WAS A\nBIG NEGATIVE EFFECT FOR HER IN THAT DAILY TRACKING POLL WHEN\nTHAT FIRST LETTER CAME OUT. ARE WE MAYBE GOING TO SEE THE\nREVERSE IN THE FINAL HOURS OF THE CAMPAIGN BECAUSE OF THIS\nLETTER? >> I THINK MARGINALLY SO.\nI THINK WE HAVE HER UP FIVE, STEVE, WHICH GELS CLOSELY WITH\nNBC \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" POLL AS WELL.\nLOOK, I TEND TO K THAT THE INFLUENCE ON THIS WHEN IT CAME\nAND SORT OF HOW IT'S RESOLVING IT'S SELF THIS CLOSE TO THE\nELECTION IS MUCH MORE AMONG THE BASES OF THE PARTY THAN A SWING\nVOTER. TO YOUR QUESTION, I CAN'T\nIMAGINE THERE WOULD BE SOMEONE THINKING, OKAY, NOW I'LL BE FOR\nHER. I FEEL LIKE MUCH OF THIS IS\nBAKED IN. TO ME THE WAY IT REALLY HURT HER\nAND HURT DOWN BALLOT DEMOCRATS, QUITE FRANKLY, IS TO SAP A\nLITTLE BIT OF ENTHUSIASM. AS BETH POINTED OUT, THERE WAS\nLESS ENERGY AND EXCITEMENT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AROUND HER\nTHE LAST WEEK BECAUSE IT WAS SORT OF LIKE, THIS AGAIN.\nSHE WILL PROBABLY BE MORE BUOYANT, MORE SORT OF OPTIMISTIC\nIN THESE LAST 48 HOURS. BUT I DO THINK IT CAN -- EVEN A\nPOINT OR TWO OF ENTHUSIASM LOST IN THE BASE DOES MATTER.\nORGANIZATION CAN MAKE UP FOR A LOT OF THAT, AND I THINK YOU'RE\nSEEING THAT IN EARLY VOTE IN NEVADA AND FLORIDA IN PARTICULAR\nFOR CLINTON. THE BROADER POINT BEING, I DON'T\nKNOW THAT THIS WAS EVER GOING TO CHANGE VAST NUMBER OF SWING\nVOTERS' MINDS. IC ITS IMPACT WAS ON ENTHUSIASM\nIN THE BASE. I THINK SHE HAS A BIG ENOUGH\nLEAD TO WITHSTAND THAT BUT THE RACE WILL PROBABLY BE CLOSER\nTHAN WE -- IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IF THIS NEVER CAME UP NINE DAYS\nAGO. >> THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE\nQUESTIONS HERE, TOO. WE'RE LOOKING A COUPLE WEEKS AGO\nAT POLLS THAT SHOW CLOSE TO DOUBLE DIGITS, DOUBLE DIGITS,\nCAME DOWN TO CLINTON TWO, THREE, FOUR.\nWAS THAT INEVITABLE? HOW MUCH OF THIS STORY IS THAT?\n>> ALMOST A LITTLE MORE OF THE SAME.\nTHE ONLY PLACE SHE SEEMS TO BE GETTING HER ENTHUSIASM IS WHEN\nSHE'S RIGHT NOW IN THE MIDDLE OF CLOUDS WITH LATINO COMMUNITY\nDOING MARKETS AND ACTUALLY SPEAKING TO CUBANS.\nCUBANS HAVEN'T VOTED FOR A DEMOCRAT SINCE THE 1960s.\nWITH THE IDEA THEY ARE GIVING HER JUICE, THAT'S THE KIND OF\nTHING WE'RE SEEING. ONE THING THAT'S REMARKABLE AND\nTALKS ABOUT HOW WE'VE BEEN BASICALLY GONE ABOVE POLITICS,\nNOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT THE HISTORY SHE'S MAKING IF SHE WERE\nTO BECOME THE FIRST WOMAN PRESIDENT.\nTHAT'S SECONDARY TO THIS NARRATIVE.\n>> IT'S REALLY TRUE. THE OTHER THING I WOULD ADD TO\nTHAT AND TO ADD TO CHRIS'S POINT, REALLY THE LASTING DAMAGE\nON THIS, AND IF SHE'S TO WIN, WE DON'T KNOW, SHE'S AHEAD RIGHT\nNOW, THIS HARDENING OF THE NOTION SHE'S A SECRETIVE PERSON\nWHO HAS GOT THINGS SHE'S HIDING. HOW MUCH OF THAT IS GOING TO\nFOLLOW HER INTO THE WHITE HOUSE. YOU'RE RIGHT.\nSHE'S MAKING HISTORY AS A FIRST WOMAN CANDIDATE.\nTHERE SHOULD BE INCREDIBLE BUOYANCY AROUND THAT AND THERE\nIS AMONG CERTAIN PEOPLE. BUT THIS IS A SHADOW CAST OVER\nHER THAT SHE UNFORTUNATELY HAS TO DEAL WITH.\n>> INGENUITY GINGRICH TODAY, BEFORE THIS BROKE NEWT GINGRICH\nSAYING, LOOK, INVESTIGATIONS WILL CONTINUE.\n>> WE HEARD THAT FROM PEOPLE IN CONGRESS.\n>> CHRIS, LET ME ASK YOU A BOTTOM LINE QUESTION.\nIF YOU'RE A TRUMP VOTER WHO FOR THE LAST NINE DAYS WHO SAYS\nTHIS, THIS E-MAIL THING, THIS FBI NEWS CARRYING MY CANDIDATE\nOVER THE TOP, IN LIGHT OF THIS LETTER TODAY, WHAT SHOULD THAT\nTRUMP -- IS THERE ANYTHING FOR THE TRUMP VOTER TO LATCH ONTO?\n>> THE MESSAGE WOULDN'T CHANGE THERE.\nUNFORTUNATELY THE WAY WE ARE IN POLITICS NOW, THE MESSAGE FROM\nREPUBLICANS WILL BE, OF COURSE, THEY PRESSURED HIM INTO SAYING\nTHAT, THE SAME WAY MESSAGE FROM DEMOCRATS NINE DAYS AGO, THE FBI\nAND JAMES COMEY DOESN'T WANT HER TO WIN.\nTHE UNFORTUNATE THING IS WE CAN'T POINT TO ANY INSTITUTION,\nFBI, CONGRESS, REPORTERS, THE CHURCH, BANKS, WHOEVER, AND SAY\nI HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THIS GROUP TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT ARE NOT\nCOLORED BY POLITICS OR PERSONAL VIEWS, SO MY GUESS IS THE TRUMP\nVOTER WILL CONCLUDE AND DONALD TRUMP WILL PROBABLY SAY TO THE\nEXTENT HE ADDRESSES IT, OF COURSE THAT'S WHAT THE FBI DID.\nAFTER ALL THEY WORKED FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL LORETTA LYNCH.\nYOU KNOW WHO HER BOSS IS, BARACK OBAMA.\nOF COURSE IT LEADS EXACTLY WHAT YOU GUYS ARE TALKING ABOUT, A\nHARDENING OF PARTISANSHIP THAT WILL NOT END ON NOVEMBER 8th.\nEVERYONE POINTS TO TUESDAY AS THOUGH THIS IS THE BE ALL END\nALL. YES, IT'S THE END OF SOMETHING\nBUT IT IS NOT THE END OF I THINK WHAT TRUMP HAS SORT OF\nREPRESENTED. THATTES NOT GOING TO DISAPPEAR\nWIN OR LOSE OR GOD FORBID DRAW, THE WORST THING EVER.\nTHAT'S NOT GOING TO DISAPPEAR ANY TIME SOON.\nI THINK WE'RE IN FOR MORE OF THE SAME RATHER THAN SOMETHING\nDIFFERENT. >> THE FLIP FLOPPING FROM BOTH\nPARTIES AND WHETHER THEY CONSIDER JAMES COMEY TO BE A MAN\nOF INTEGRITY OR PARTISAN ATTACK WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE.\nTHANK YOU.", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1478479753209.1478475826563.08f84f02-4708-40c4-9653-d839fcc57957.segment2.thumb.jpg", "channel": "356"}, {"start": 583333.0, "length": 750885.0, "end": 1334218, "date": 1478477646466, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1478480514585.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1478477643406-ac64755f-11af-453a-bfe0-6758fc496eb8-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=583.33,1334.22", "text": "MATTHEWS IN NEW YORK.\nWITH JUST HOUR TO GO UNTIL ELECTION DAY BREAKING NEWS FROM\nFEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION.

YOU'RE STILL REMINDING PEOPLE,\nYOU KNOW WHAT -- TO ME, THE THING THAT ALWAYS WAS THE BIGGER\nNEGATIVE FOR HER ON THE COMEY ANNOUNCEMENT WAS IT WAS THE\nREMINDER THAT WITH THE CLINTONS COME DRAMA.\nTHAT WAS THE REACTION I HEARD FROM SOME VOTERS.\nI REMEMBER PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO STILL VOTE FOR CLINTON, OH,\nIT'S ALWAYS SO EXHAUSTING WITH THE CLINTONS.\nEVEN FOLKS WILL SAY, YES, IT MAY BE THE REPUBLICANS FAULT BUT\nTHEY ARE THE MAGNET FOR THIS STUFF.\nWHY ARE THEY THE MAGNETS FOR THIS STUFF.\nSOMEHOW THE OBAMAS ARE NOT THE SAME LEVEL OF MAGNET FOR ALL OF\nTHESE INVESTIGATIONS AND THINGS LIKE THAT.\nSO YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT TO TALK ABOUT IT MORE?\nI MEAN, IT'S DONE DAMAGE. IT'S PROBABLY COST DEMOCRATS\nONE, MAYBE TWO SENATE SEATS THESE PAST NINE DAYS.\nTHEY STILL IN CONTROL BUT IT'S HURT THEM.\n>> THAT'S THE REAL STORY. WHY NOT TALKING ABOUT IT BECAUSE\nHER SUPPORTERS NEVER BELIEVED SHE HAD AN ISSUE WITH IT, PEOPLE\nAT RALLIES, MED YAS ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT SO SHE DOESN'T\nNEED TO. THE STORY CHUCK IS TALKING IS\nTHE REAL ONE. HOW DOES THIS AFFECT DOWN BALLOT\nRACES? YOU'RE STARTING TO SEE TALK NOW.\nWHAT DOES THIS DO NOW? DO IT PUT THEM MORE AT RISK?\nPROBABLY NOT. THERE WAS A LOT OF DISCUSSION\nWHEN THIS FIRST HAPPENED OF WHAT IT COULD DO AND FRANKLY BOOST\nSOME OF THE REPUBLICANS. >> THERE'S TWO EXTRAORDINARILY\nCLOSE THAT ANY TINY MOVEMENT -- >> MISSOURI.\n>> MORE NORTH CAROLINA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE.\nI THINK THAT'S WHERE IT WOULD BE THE MOST.\n>> WHICH WAY IS MISSOURI NOW? >> I THINK MISSOURI IS -- I\nTHINK BLOUNT IS BAILED OUT BY A TRUMP SURGE IN RURAL AMERICA.\n>> PART OF THAT SURGE I SAW WHEN I DROVE ACROSS PENNSYLVANIA THE\nLAST FEW DAYS, SEEMED LIKE MODERATE REPUBLICANS,\nREPUBLICANS ON THE FENCE, THEY ARE TILTED TOWARD TRUMP BECAUSE\nOF WHAT THE FBI DID LAST WEEK. NOW WITH THE FBI COMING OUT AND\nSAYING A DIFFERENT STORY, YOU WANT TO DO THOSE MODERATE\nREPUBLICANS WHO A FEW DAYS AGO SAYING I'M GOING FOR TRUMP NOW,\nI CAN'T HAVE CLINTON IN THERE. DO THEY STICK HOME, GO FOR HER?\nWHAT DO THEY DO? DOES TRUMP'S TURNOUT CHANGE?\n>> I THINK THEY ALREADY VOTED. A LOT OF THEM EARLY VOTED.\nTHE ONLY ONES LEFT -- THAT'S WHY THE ONLY ONES LEFT MAY BE NEW\nHAMPSHIRE. >> ANDREA, I'M LOOKING AT THIS\nRACE AS IT WAS MOVING TOWARDS HILLARY, MOMENTS WITH HER,\nMOMENTUM WITH HER UNTIL FRIDAY TWO WEEKS AGO.\nALMOST LIKE IN THE WORLD SERIES LAST GAME SOMEONE HITS A\nTHREE-RUN HOME RUN, COMEY. THE WHOLE THING IS EVEN MONEY\nAGAIN. HILLARY OVERRAN THAT.\nBY WEDNESDAY SHE WAS GETTING BACK HER PACE, GETTING A POINT\nOR TWO A DAY. SHE HAD OUTRUN THE THING.\nTODAY THEY FEEL THEY HAD ALREADY OUTRAN THE THING SO DIDN'T HAVE\nTO JUMP AND MAKE A DECISION ABOUT COMEY TO EXONERATE HER\nTONIGHT. >> THEY FRANKLY BECAUSE OF ALL\nTHOSE LEAKS, RUDY GIULIANI AND THE REST, THEY DIDN'T THINK THIS\nWOULD BE SO BEFORE THE ELECTION. THEY HAD COME UP WITH\nALTERNATIVE STRATEGY, GO ON THE ATTACK AND THEN TRY TO RIDE THE\nCLOSING DAYS AND GET ALL -- FLOOD THE ZONE WITH PRESIDENT\nOBAMA, MICHELLE OBAMA, ALL THE SURROGATES OUT THERE.\nNOW THEY WANT TO JUST STICK ON ANYTHING THAT DOES NOT REMIND\nPEOPLE, AS CHUCK SAID, THAT SHE HAD A PRIVATE SERVER.\nTHAT'S WHAT SOME WOULD CALL THE ORIGINAL SIN THAT SHE CAN'T\nREALLY PROPERLY EXPLAIN. SHE'S APOLOGIZED NOW FOR IT.\nTHE MORE SHE TALKS ABOUT THIS -- >> CAN'T BLAME THE FBI.\n>> THE CLINTON PLAN, JUST TO STAY ON HER FOR A MINUTE,\nCHANGED THREE OR FOUR TIMES. ORIGINAL, HIGH ROAD ENDING, THEY\nGO LOW, WE GO HIGH. THEN THE THING IN THE OLD DAYS\nWITH MONICA, WE JUST HAVE TO WIN.\nREMEMBER THAT LINE FROM MR. CLINTON, WE JUST HAVE TO WIN.\nTHEN THE STRATEGY FLOOD THE ZONE, POLITICAL STUFF TO\nOVERCOME IT. NOW WE'RE AGAIN TONIGHT BACK TO\nHIGH ROAD. >> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT HIGH ROAD.\nI THINK IT'S IGNORE THE BAD AND GRIND OUT LAST 48 HOURS, LET THE\nMACHINE DO THE WORK. >> BETWEEN THE HIGH ROAD --\nGRINDING IT OUT ON THE ROAD. >> RUN AGAINST REPUBLICAN PARTY\nRIGHT NOW, DEMOCRATS AND SECRETARY CLINTON BECAUSE YOU\nCAN LOOK AHEAD AND SAY REPUBLICANS WANT TO INVESTIGATE.\nIS THIS WHAT YOU REALLY WANT? THE FBI HAS CLEARED ME.\nWE'RE SAFE HERE. WE'RE LOOKING AT A CULTURE IN\nWASHINGTON ALL ABOUT INVESTIGATIONS.\nLET'S MOVE BEYOND THAT, ELECT DEMOCRATS AND ELECT CLINTON.\n>> BY THE WAY, THAT'S SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT.\nTAKE SOME AIR OUT OF TRUMP'S CLOSING ARGUMENT.\nCOMEY GAVE TRUMP A COHESIVE CLOSING ARGUMENT OF ESSENTIALLY,\nYOU DON'T WANT THIS CLINTON MESS, INVESTIGATE ALL THE TIME\nSHE'S THERE AND ALL THIS STUFF. IT DOES TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF AIR\nOUT OF THAT BALLOON FOR TRUMP. >> YOU JUST ANTICIPATED MY\nCLOSING ARGUMENT TONIGHT. I'VE ALREADY WRITTEN IT.\nI BASICALLY SAID THIS WAS HIS CLOSING ARGUMENT FOUNDED ON THIS\nFBI REPORT THEY ARE LOOKING AT E-MAILS.\nHE WAS ABLE TO SAY THAT'S EVIDENCE IN IT'S SELF, EGREGIOUS\nCRIME, WORSE THAN WATERGATE THE FACT THEY ARE LOOKING AT\nE-MAILS. >> LOOK AT E-MAILS WITH WEINER,\nPERVERT THING. >> THAT'S STRONG.\n>> A STRONG AD, CERTAINLY STUCK OUT.\n>> LOOK, HERE IS COMEY'S FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT NINE DAYS AGO.\nTRUMP MADE IT A CENTERPIECE OF HIS CLOSING ARGUMENT.\nLET'S WATCH THAT. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.\n>> THE FBI WOULD NEVER HAVE REOPENED THIS CASE AT THIS TIME\nUNLESS IT WAS A MOST EGREGIOUS CRIMINAL OFFENSE.\nTHIS IS THE BIGGEST SCANDAL SINCE WATERGATE.\nSHE'S LIKELY TO BE UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR MANY, MANY\nYEARS. ALSO LIKELY TO CONCLUDE IN A\nCRIMINAL TRIAL. THIS IS NOT WHAT WE NEED IN THIS\nCOUNTRY, FOLKS. THE WORK OF GOVERNMENT WOULD\nGRIND TO HALT IF SHE WERE ELECTED.\nSHE'LL BE IN COURT FOR HER ENTIRE TENURE.\nSHE'LL BE CONVICTED. >> THIS WHOLE LINE OF\nARGUMENT -- >> NOTHING.\nSTILL TALKING ABOUT IT. STILL TALKING ABOUT WHAT HE\nCALLS A POTENTIAL INDICTMENT AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON EVEN\nTHOUGH THERE'S NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT.\nTHIS CAME OUT ON DIFFERENT NETWORK, WALKED BACK THERE\nWASN'T GOING TO BE -- >> FBI LEAKS.\n>> HE'S GOING TO KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT.\nWHAT I THINK THIS DID FOR HIM WAS TEACH HIM MORE THAN ANY\nOTHER MOMENT IN THE CAMPAIGN, IF HE REALLY DOES WHAT ALL HIS\nADVISERS WANT HIM TO DO, STAY ON MESSAGE, HE WOULD SEE POLLS\nTIGHTEN. HE GAVE HIMSELF THE PEP TALK\nABOUT IT. >> IS HE --\n>> THE RACE IS TIGHT. HE'S GOING AFTER HER CONSTANTLY,\nGOING AFTER AFFORDABLE CARE ACT CONSTANTLY.\n>> THE THING WE'RE ALSO HEARING IN TRUMP'S CLOSING MESSAGE.\nIT'S ANTI-CLINTON, BRUTAL POPULISM AND NATIONALISM STEVE\nBANNON IS WHISPERING IN HIS EAR. THAT'S PART OF THIS TWO-MINUTE\nCLOSING FOR TRUMP. HE'S GOING TO MINNESOTA, BLUE\nSTATES, RECORD TURNOUT OF WHITE WORKING CLASS PEOPLE HE COULD\nSOMEHOW HAVE A NARROW PATH TO VICTORY.\nTHAT'S THE WAY THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT IT.\n>> CHUCK, PEOPLE IN CLINTON CAMPAIGN APPARENTLY BELIEVE THEY\nHAVE BEEN ABLE TO THWART HIM, PREVENT HIM FROM TALKING HIS\nMESSAGE. SO BUSY TALKING THIS STUFF HE\nHASN'T BEEN ABLE TO TALK ABOUT THE REASON HE WAS UP 40%, THE\nREASON HE BEAT 16 GUYS IN THE PRIMARIES.\nHE HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO TALK ABOUT TRADE, ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION\nAND WARS. >> HE DID MAKE THE MISTAKE --\nFRANKLY, THIS IS A SIMILAR MISTAKE MITT ROMNEY MADE IN THE\nLAST MONTH OF THE CAMPAIGN IN 2012, WHICH IS FOLLOW THE NEWS\nCYCLE. NEWS CYCLE CANDIDATES -- THERE'S\nSOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES IN PUNDITRY THAT TALK ABOUT WHO\nWINS THE NEWS CYCLE, THOSE THINGS MATTER.\nNO, IT DOESN'T. YOU GET CAUGHT FOLLOWING THE\nNEWS CYCLE, IT CAN FEEL GOOD IN THE MOMENT.\nIT'S LIKE TAKING A B-12 SHOT BUT IT DOESN'T LAST.\nFUNDAMENTALS MATTER MORE IN THE LONG RUN.\nTHERE WERE LARGER FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES IN THE COUNTRY THAT TRUMP\nWAS TAPPING INTO CORRECTLY AND HE GOT OFF THE MESSAGE A LITTLE\nBIT LONG-TERM.

I SAW A STATEMENT BY YOU TODAY\nSAYING THAT IN EFFECT, THIS IS LIGHTS OUT FOR THIS\nINVESTIGATION. >> RIGHT, THIS IS NOT THE\nHALFTIME REPORT TO PICK UP ON YOUR FOOTBALL ANALOGY.\nWE'VE LOOKED AT THE E-MAILS, THE IN TERMS OF HILLARY CLINTON'S,\nTHE QUESTION OF WHETHER THEY WERE CLASSIFIED MATERIALS ON HER\nSERVER. WHICH IS WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT.\nWHAT THEY SAY IS THAT THEY'VE GONE THROUGH AND FOUND THAT MANY\nOF THEM AS WE SUSPECTED THEY WERE DUPLICATES WITH A DATA SET\nTHE FBI ALREADY HAD AFTER MONTHS OF GATHERING THE DOCUMENTS THAT\nWERE FOUND ON HER SERVER. MANY WERE DUPLICATES, SOME\nSOCIAL MESSAGE, WHAT TIME DO YOU WANT TO GO TO THE AIRPORT.\nTHE REMAINDER, THEY DETERMINED ONE AND TWO PARTIAL BITS OF\nCLASSIFIED INFORMATION AND THAT'S WHY COMEY SAYS THIS\nDOESN'T CHANGE THE BOTTOM LINE FOR US.\nTHEY HAD CONCLUDED THAT NO PROSECUTOR WOULD BRING THIS\nCASE. >> PETE WILLIAMS WITH THE\nEXPLANATION OF TODAY'S LEGAL MATTER.\n>> NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO NORTH LIVE TO MANCHESTER, NEW\nHAMPSHIRE, WHERE ANDREA MITCHELL IS AT THE CLINTON EVENT THERE.\nIN HER CLOSING ARGUMENT, HILLARY CLINTON IS APPEARING WITH THE\nFATHER OF CAPTAIN KHAN WHO WAS KILLED IN IRAQ.\nHOW'S IT BEEN TONIGHT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE?\nWHAT'S HAPPENING THERE? >> IT'S BEEN EXTRAORDINARY.\nFIRST OF ALL, SHE DID NOT MENTION THE E-MAIL CONTROVERSY.\nAND WITH LeBRON JAMES.

THEY KNOW THERE HAS BEEN DAMAGE.\nTHEY HAD THE MOMENTUM OVER THE LAST NINE DAYS JUST STALLED AND\nTHE REAL DAMAGE IF SHE DOES END UP WINNING NONE THE LESS, THE\nDAMAGE TO REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES WHO NOW GOT A LIFELINE.\nSO, THE DAMAGE IS TO THEIR DEMOCRATIC OPPONENTS.\nKELLY AYOTTE MAY WELL WIN HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.\nSAME FOR ROY BLUNT IN  MISSOURI. REAL TANGIBLE RESULTS DAMAGED.\nTO DEMOCRATS AROUND THIS COUNTRY FROM WHAT HAPPENED IN THE LAST\nNINE DAYS. TONIGHT, THERE WAS A CONCERT.\nIT'S FILLED. THE OVERFLOW ROOM IS FILLED.\nTHEY HAVE OPENED UP THE DOOR TO THE BALLROOM.\nTHERE ARE LOT OF PEOPLE HERE. JAMES TAYLOR PLAYED FOR 45\nMINUTES. IT WAS EXTRAORDINARY AND I\nTHOUGHT, WELL, THAT IS SO MELLOW, HOW DOES KHAN FOLLOW\nTHAT. HE CAME AND THIS CROWD WAS ON\nTHEIR FEET SCREAMING FOR HIM WITH HIS HEARTBREAKING STORY\nABOUT HIS SON AND A MESSAGE AGAINST BULLYING.\nTHIS HAS BEEN SORT OF A MAGICAL NIGHT STAYING ON MESSAGE AND\nTRYING TO RECAPTURE THE MOMENTUM GOING INTO THE FINAL DAY.\n>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

HE SAID THAT IT'S NOT POSSIBLE\nTHAT THE FBI COULD HAVE GONE THROUGH 650,000 E-MAILS IN THE\nLAST NINE DAYS. HE SAYS THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS\nGUILTY AND ULTIMATELY IS URGING THE VOTERS TO PROVIDE THE FINAL\nVERDICT ON TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 8th.\nWHAT STRIKES IS THE FACT THAT THESE PEOPLE WHO SAID WERE\nCOMING AROUND TO TRUMP ARE PROUD OF SUPPORTING HIM.\nTHAT'S WHAT A SENIOR ADVISER TOLD ME.\nTHE PROBLEM HAS NEVER BEEN THE WHITE WORKING CLASS VOTERS, IT'S\nBEEN THE SUBURBAN REPUBLICANS, HE SAYS THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT\nAS A RESULT OF THIS E-MAIL INVESTIGATION HAVE COME HOME.\nMUCH THE SAME WAY MIKE PENCE HAS DESCRIBED IT.\nWE ARE HEARING FROM AIDES OVER THE COURSE OF THIS DAY, THEY'RE\nPROJECTING REAL CONFIDENCE, SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE STATE OF\nMICHIGAN AND THE UPPER MIDWEST. IT'S A STATE THAT NO REPUBLICAN\nHAS WON SINCE 1988. IF THAT PATH DOESN'T WORK,\nTHEY'RE HOPING HE MIGHT PICK UP A STATE LIKE MINNESOTA.\nNO REPUBLICANS WON THERE SINCE 1972.\nTRUMP TODAY AS WE'RE HEARING CNN SUCKS CHANTS BEHIND ME NOW.\nCNN WAS IN MINNESOTA, HE'S BEEN THERE MANY TIMES.\nTODAY WAS THE FIRST DAY HE HAD A RALLY.\nBACK TO YOU. >> THANK YOU.\nIN MOON TOWNSHIP, PENNSYLVANIA. IT IS A WEIRD ACT OF, NOT\nEXACTLY BRAVERY. BUT IT IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT\nTHAN IT USUALLY IS ON POLITICAL CAMPAIGN TO SHOW UP AT A DONALD\nTRUMP RALLY AS A POLITICAL REPORTER.\nTHE WAY THAT THE SPEAKERS INCLUDING TRUMP HIMSELF DIRECT\nTHE CROWD TO TURN ON REPORTERS IN THE ROOM TO DENOUNCE THEM AND\nSCREAM AT THEM AND FLIP THEM OFF.\nIT'S A WEIRD THING. >> OUR TECHNICAL FOLKS WILL TELL\nYOU THERE'S BEEN A RECORD NUMBER OF REQUESTS FOR THE TWO-EAR EAR\nPIECE WE ALWAYS WEAR. I WEAR ONE IN ONE EAR, BUT IN A\nLOUD ENVIRONMENT, YOU WEAR TWO AND YOU HAVE TO BLOCK OUT THE\nWORLD OR NOTHING YOU SAY WOULD MAKE SENSE, SO AS LONG AS NO ONE\nGETS HURT, A BOISTEROUS ROOM I THINK WE WOULD CALL THAT.\nLET'S BRING IN OUR EXPANDED FAMILY.\nNICOLE WALLACE IS HERE WITH US. FORMER COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR\nFOR THE BUSH WHITE HOUSE AND EUGENE ROBINSON WITH \"THE\nWASHINGTON POST\" WHOSE COLUMN THIS WEEK SETS OUT HIS CLOSING\nARGUMENT ON WHY PEOPLE SHOULD NOT VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nNICOLE, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF TO THIS SUNDAY, IN AMERICAN\nPOLITICS? >> WELL, I THINK IT'S MORE\nSINISTER. GOING BACK TO YOUR BLOOD.\nI HATE BLOOD, SO DON'T KNOW WHY I'M GOING BACK.\n>> THE BLOOD DRAW.  WE WERE ON THE AIR WHEN THE\nNEWS BROKE AND THERE WAS THE SENSE THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG,\nIT WAS MORE LIKE THE EARLY INDICATIONS ARE THAT THE PATIENT\nIS SICK. THERE WAS A GREAT STORY OF \"NEW\nYORK TIMES\" ABOUT IMPACT THE NEWS HAD ON DONALD TRUMP AS A\nCANDIDATE. TURNED HIM INTO SOMETHING NO\nFRIEND, NO FAMILY MEMBER HAD BEEN ABLE TO DO.\nDANA BASH DESCRIBED HIM TODAY AS A THUNDER BOLT FROM GOD.\nGAVE HIM THE FAITH HE COULD WIN, SO NOT ONLY IS IT IMMEASURABLE\nTHAT IT AFFECTED THE PEOPLE WHO ALREADY VOTED, IT TURNED HIM\nINTO SOMEBODY DIFFERENT. FOR 11 VITAL DAYS.\n>> MY FAVORITE DETL IN THE STORY WAS STEVE BANNON, HIS\nPANTS LITERALLY CAUGHT ON FIRE. THE MOST OVERUSED METAPHOR IN\nPOLITICAL MEDIA. HIS PANTS CAUGHT ON FIRE.\nHE WAS FOCUSED SO MUCH ON FRYING TO COME UP WITH A RESPONSE, HIS\nPANTS LIT ON FIRE. >> THAT'S THE HEAT OF POLITICAL\nCAMPAIGN. >>\nHE WAS NEXT TO A -- >> HE HAD ON LIKE -- SPECIAL\nPANTS. >> I THOUGHT IT WAS SPONTANEOUS\nCOMBUSTION. >> I THINK THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN'S REACTION TO TODAY'S COMEY LETTER AND LET'S HOPE\nTHERE ARE NO MORE BEFORE TUESDAY, WAS JUST REALISM.\nA WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE HAVE EARLY VOTED.\nUNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT HILLARY CLINTON WAS ONCE AGAIN\nBEING INVESTIGATED ON THE E-MAILS AND YOU KNOW, ALL THE\nSMOKE OUT THERE. AND SO NOW, THEY KNOW THERE'S NO\nFIRE. DID THAT AFFECT THE VOTE?\nPROBABLY DID. DID IT AFFECT THE VOTE HUGELY?\nI WONDER. I THINK IT PROBABLY DID SOME\nREPUBLICANS HOME TO PARTY. I THINK IT DID, AND THIS IS MORE\nIMPORTANT FOR DOWN BALLOT RACES. PROBABLY DID BRING OUT\nREPUBLICANS. TO SIT THIS ONE OUT.\n>> YOU KNOW, HOW DID -- HAD IT BEEN 36 HOURS, THREE DAYS, NINE\nDAYS OF EARLY VOTING WHEN MORE THAN 30 MILLION AMERICANS ARE\nEARLY VOTING. HE HIT THE SWEET SPOT IN TERMS\nOF LOCKING IN SOMETHING NEGATIVE ABOUT CANDIDATE.\nIF COMEY DID HAVE AS A POLITICAL MISSILE, HE COULDN'T HAVE HIT IT\nMORE DIRECTLY. >> THE DAY AFTER THE ELECTION,\nTHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN, PEOPLE WOULD BE GOING CRAZY, SO, YOU\nKNOW, THE BULK OF THE VOTE WILL BE OUT ON TUESDAY.\nAND YEAH, I THINK THE CLINTON FOLKS WANT TO MITIGATE THE\nDAMAGE IF POSSIBLE. AND THERE PROBABLY WAS DAMAGE.\n>> I HEARD THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN FEARING, THE COMEY LETTER MAY\nHAVE BEEN A PERMISSION SLIP FOR MODERATE REPUBLICANS WHO\nCOULDN'T VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP OR SO THEY THOUGHT, WOW, EARLY\nIN THE EVENING.

WILL HILLARY CLINTON BE ABLE TO\nMAKE IMPORTANT DECISIONS WHEN SHE'S GOT THESE INVESTIGATIONS\nOVERHANGING? WHAT DOES THE MORNING AFTER LOOK\nLIKE FOR TRUMP?

NO DAYLIGHT BETWEEN THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN'S APPROACH TO WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT YOU WERE\nREADING IN MANY MEDIA OUTLETS. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED ON\nTHE SUBSTANCE. YOU HAVE AN FBI INVESTIGATION,\nINTO ONE OF THE CANDIDATES WHO IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.\nTHAT IS JUST LEGITIMATE ON ITS OWN.\nHOW IT AFFECTS THE RACE SHOULD NOT BE THE PRIMARY CONCERN OF\nTHE MEDIA COVERING THIS RACE, AND IT IS A BIG REASON WHY\nPEOPLE HAVE SUCH A DIFFICULTY TRUSTING THEIR MEDIA TO COVER\nTHINGS. >> ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT MEDIA\nFOLLOWED THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN LINE OR JUST SOMEHOW CAME TO THE\nSAME CONCLUSION AS PEOPLE IN THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN.\n>> YOU CAN SEE IT BY THE WAY THE MEDIA COVERED THINGS DIFFERENTLY\nWHEN THE FBI LET HER GET AWAY WITH THE MISHANDLING OF\nCLASSIFIED INFORMATION IN JULY, A LOT OF REPUBLICANS WERE UPSET\nABOUT THAT. YOU SAW THE MEDIA COVERAGE\nSAYING THIS WAS SO AWFUL YOU WOULD QUESTION AN FBI\nINVESTIGATION. ALL OF A SUDDEN, WHEN IT\nCHANGES, THEY ALSO CHANGE. IT IS, AGAIN, FOLLOWING THE\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN INSTEAD OF DOING REAL JOURNALISM.\n>> YOU CAN'T TAKE THIS OUT OF THE POLITICS OF IT.\nIT HAS GOT TO GET COVERED AND THERE WERE POLITICS AND THE\nOTHER THING THAT WAS GOING ON, THE REPUBLICANS -- I MEAN, BOTH\nSIDES FOR PARTISAN PURPOSES PILED ON AND THE PRESS -- THE\nPRESS INITIALLY COVERED WHAT CHAFFETZ AND OTHER REPUBLICANS\nWERE -- AND TRUMP WERE SAYING, AND THAT IMMEDIATELY POLITICIZED\nIT. >> THERE WAS A REOPENING OF AN\nINVESTIGATION, OBVIOUSLY TRUE, AND IMMEDIATELY YOU HAD THE\nMEDIA CHANGING THE HEADLINES ON THEIR STORIES IN RESPONSE TO\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN COMPLAINTS. AND IT WAS THE SILLIEST THING TO\nSAY -- >> IT IS A CRIMINAL\nINVESTIGATION, AND THAT SHE'S GOING TO JAIL AND IF HE WAS\nPRESIDENT -- >> THERE IS LEGITIMATE QUESTION\nOF WHETHER OR NOT THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF E-MAILS THAT\nWERE FOUND ON WEINER'S LAPTOP COULD TURN OUT TO BE INCREDIBLY\nINCRIMINATING.

IT IS A WAY FOR HIM TO BE OUT\nHERE AND SAY THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE PROGRESS INTO BLUE STATES\nAND TO LOOK LIKE THEY'RE PLAYING ON OFFENSE, EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE\nTRYING TO SORT OF FIGURE OUT WHAT PATH COULD ACTUALLY GET\nTHEM TO 270, JAKE. >> SARAH MURRAY IN MINNEAPOLIS\nWITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. THANK YOU SO MUCH.\nLET'S GET SOME REACTION NOW FROM LAURA COATES, A CNN LEGAL\nANALYST AND FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR.\nJOINS ME IN STUDIO. ALSO, WE HAVE WITH US,\nJOURNALIST AND AUTHOR, CARL BURNSTEIN.\nCOMEY'S LETTER BASICALLY SAYING, NEVERMIND.\n>> IF IT COULD HAVE BEEN RESOLVED SO QUICKLY, WHY DIDN'T\nYOU WAIT TO GIVE THE LETTER IN THE FIRST PLACE?\nIT'S A PRECEDENT THAT COMEY CONTINUES TO SET.\nTHOUGH THE RECENT E-MAIL PROBE MAY BE OVER, JAKE, WELL, HE\nHASN'T ESSENTIALLY SAID, I'M NO LONGER GOING TO INSERT MYSELF\nINTO POLITICS ANY LONGER. WHAT IF MORE E-MAILS COME OUT\nBEFORE THE INAUGURATION AND, IN FACT, SHE IS ELECTED PRESIDENT?\nTHIS IS AN ONGOING THING THAT WILL BE CAPITALIZED ON BY THE\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN AND GOING FORWARD FOR HER OPPONENTS IF SHE DOES\nTAKES OFFICE. BECAUSE THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS\nIS ESSENTIALLY SAYING, WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A COURT OF LAW\nDECIDE. IT'S GOING TO BE THE COURT OF\nPUBLIC OPINION. THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION IS\nEXHAUSTED AT THE PROSPECT OF IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS OR\nANYTHING ELSE. I THINK HIS IMPACT IS GOING TO\nBE FAR MORE LASTING. IT WON'T REALLY BE RESOLVED BY\nHIS CONTINUOUS LETTERS TO CONGRESS, WHERE HE SAYS, YOU\nKNOW, IT'S A BIG NEVERMIND. IT IS A BIG NO PROBLEM HERE.\nWE'RE GOING TO MAYBE STILL HAVE MORE E-MAILS THAT MAY COME OUT\nDURING THE COURSE OF INVESTIGATIONS THAT AREN'T YET\nCLOSED THAT WOULD INVOLVE EITHER HER COLLEAGUES OR HERSELF.\n>> FBI DIRECTOR COMEY ISN'T HERE TO DEFEND HIMSELF.\nI'LL PLAY DEVIL'S ADVOCATE. IF FBI DIRECTOR COMEY CAME OUT\nIN JULY AND SPOKE AS FREELY AS HE DID IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE,\nAS WELL AS TO CONGRESS, BECAUSE HE FELT IT WAS -- TRANSPARENCY\nWAS IMPORTANT, FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THE INTEGRITY OF HIS\nDECISION. THAT MOTIVATED HIM TWO FRIDAYS\nAGO. HEY, I TESTIFIED UNDER OATH THAT\nALL THE EVIDENCE HAS BEEN REVIEWED.\nSUDDENLY, WE HAVE NEW INFORMATION AND THAT MAKES THE\nSTATEMENT NO LONGER TRUE. LET ME CLARIFY WITH NEW\nINFORMATION. THEN ONCE AGAIN, HE IS DOING\nSOMETHING IN THE NAME, IN HIS MIND, OF TRANSPARENCY AND\nINTEGRITY. COULD YOU NOT SEE IT THROUGH\nTHAT LENS AND MAYBE NOT HAVE THE TOUGHER CONCLUSION THAT YOU\nREACH? >> AS A FORMER PUBLIC SERVANT, I\nTHINK THOSE VIEWPOINTS ARE SELFISH.\nTHE IDEA THAT ONE WOULD HAVE TO CONFIRM OR DEFEND ONE'S OWN\nOBJECTIVITY, THE POSITION WHERE HE HAS A TEN-YEAR TENURE,\nOUTLASTING ANY PRESIDENT OF EVEN TWO TERMS, THE ONUS WAS NOT ON\nHIM TO PROVE HIS OBJECTIVITY. IT WAS TO ADHERE TO THE PROPER\nPROTOCOL IN PLACE BY THE PEOPLE HE SERVES, THE GREATER UNITED\nSTATES, BUT MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.\nHE HAD INSTRUCTION FROM LORETTA LYNCH, THE SITTING ATTORNEY\nGENERAL AND THE FORMER AG, ERIC HOLDER, WHO PUT INTO PLACE\nPROTOCOLS TO SAY WE DON'T WANT TO, ONE, ALLOW OUR VIEWPOINTS TO\nINTERFERE WITH ANYONE'S POLITICAL MOTIVATION, BUT MORE\nIMPORTANTLY, WE DON'T COMMENT ONION GOING INVESTIGATIONS.\nI UNDERSTAND HIS SELFISH MOTIVATION TO SAY, I'D LIKE TO\nMAKE SURE EVERYBODY HERE KNOWS I'M ON THE UP AND UP.\nI DIDN'T DO THE SERVICE HE NEEDED TO DO AS A PUBLIC\nSERVANT. >> LET ME GO TO CARL ON THE\nPHONE. THE IDEA THAT THIS E-MAIL -- THE\nLETTER THAT WAS RELEASED TWO FRIDAYS AGO, THAT THESE E-MAILS\nWOULDN'T HAVE BEEN MENTIONED TO CONGRESS UNLESS IT WAS SOMETHING\nSERIOUS WAS DEFINITELY, BASICALLY, CONVENTIONAL WISDOM.\nHE'D NEVER DO THIS UNLESS IT REALLY COULD THROW A WRENCH INTO\nTHE CONCLUSION REACHED IN JULY. THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE A LOT OF\nPEOPLE CONCLUDED. IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE CASE.\n>> IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE CASE.\nAT THE SAME TIME, REPUBLICANS THAT I'VE TALKED TO ALREADY\nDON'T SEEM WILLING TO LET GO OF THIS BONE.\nTHAT THE DOGS ARE STILL GOING TO BE CHEWING AT THIS.\nTHEY'RE FURIOUS NOW AT COMEY AND THERE IS NO SIGN THAT I CAN SEE\nTHAT THOSE WHO PURSUED THIS MATTER IN CONGRESS, THE\nREPUBLICANS, ARE GOING TO LET GO OF THIS.\nPARTICULARLY BECAUSE OF THE ELEMENT OF HILLARY CLINTON'S\nCLOSEST AIDE, HUMA ABEDIN, AND JUST THE OPTICS AND EXPLOITATION\nOF THE NOTION THAT ANTHONY WEINER IS INVOLVED IN THIS.\nIN TERMS OF THE ELECTION ITSELF, HILLARY CLINTON HAS A CHANCE\nHERE TO PERHAPS NOT PUT THIS BEHIND HER BUT IF SHE WINS THE\nELECTION, PARTICULARLY, TO MAKE TALK TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\nABOUT HOW THIS COULD BE PUT BEHIND HER IF SHE IS THE\nPRESIDENT ELECT FOR THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY.\nAND SHE'S GOT AN OPPORTUNITY HERE THAT SHE DID NOT HAVE TWO\nHOURS AGO. >> CARL, FORGIVE ME FOR BRINGING\nIT UP, BUT I WAS WATCHING \"ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN\" A COUPLE\nDAYS AGO. I WAS THINKING OF THE FACT THAT\nDONALD TRUMP AND OTHERS IN THE CAMPAIGN WAS SAYING THIS IS\nWORSE THAN WATERGATE. WE HAVEN'T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO\nSPEAK SINCE THE STORY BROKE TWO WEEK AGO.\nIS THIS WORSE THAN WATERGATE? >> NO.\nTHE SERVER HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S AWFUL\nJUDGMENT. IT WAS INEXCUSABLE, WHAT SHE\nDID. AT THE SAME TIME, WATERGATE WAS\nABOUT A CRIMINAL PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nWHO PRESIDED OVER A CRIMINAL PRESIDENCY FROM THE TIME HE CAME\nTO OFFICE TILL THE DAY HE LEFT. 48 PEOPLE WERE FOUND GUILTY OR\nPLEADED GUILTY IN WATERGATE. 30 SOMETHING OF THEM WENT TO\nJAIL. IT WAS AN ENORMOUS CONSPIRACY TO\nUNDERMINE THE VERY NOTION OF GOVERNMENT THAT SERVES THE\nPEOPLE, OF FREE ELECTIONS. THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYTHING IN\nOUR HISTORY LIKE IT AND HOPEFULLY THERE WON'T BE AGAIN.\nBUT PART OF THE PROBLEM, I THINK, FOR ALL OF US WHO COVERED\nTHIS STORY, WE'VE TRIED TO COVER IT AS A MATTER OF HILLARY\nCLINTON'S JUDGMENT. AS A LEGAL MATTER, AS WELL.\nAT THE SAME TIME, PERHAPS WE HAVE LOST IN THE PROCESS SOME\nSENSE OF COMPARISON. THERE IS NO COMPARISON.\nIT IS APPLES AND ORANGES WHEN YOU START TO TALK ABOUT\nWATERGATE AND ABOUT IMPEACHMENT OF A CRIMINAL PRESIDENT OF THE\nUNITED STATES. >> CARL BERNSTEIN AND LAURA\nCOATES, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1478471249028.1478468080109.98b99fe1-7d4c-42e0-aa96-ad16a770b064.segment1.thumb.jpg", "channel": "202"}, {"start": 0, "length": 232811.0, "end": 232811, "date": 1478477091744, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1478479732508.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1478477089281-067deb22-666b-4e08-b663-67babeed9a89-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=0.00,232.81", "text": "SHOULD HE LEAVE?\n>> THAT'S ABOVE MY PAY GRADE.

IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT KIND OF\nARGUMENT. >> OH, HE TIES THE DOG ON THE\nROOF. >> I WAS IN 2012 I REMEMBER THAT\nONE. >> THERE WAS -- I'M NOT SAYING\nTHERE WEREN'T SOME DEMOCRATS IN THE COUNTRY BUT IF YOU LOOK AT\nWHAT THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN DID, THE CAMPAIGN WAS COME IMMEDIATELY\nDIFFERENT THAN THE KIND OF CAMPAIGN BECAUSE IT'S A DIFFER\nREPUBLICAN NOMINEE. >> I THINK WHAT BILL MAHER IS\nDOING IS ACCURATE. THERE'S A LCLEAR DELINEATION.\nTHEY'RE NOT ON THAT SPECTRUM. I THINK THAT DONALD TRUMP POSES\nA CLEAR AND PRESEB DANGER AND IT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THE THINGS\nTHAT HE EMBRACES AND, YOU KNOW IN TWITTER JUST A MINUTE AGO I\nFOUND OUT THAT JOHN McCAIN VOTED AGAINST HIM BUT AT THE END OF\nTHE DAY WROTE QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT DONALD -- WHETHER OR NOT\nJOHN McCAIN FEELS DIFFERENTLY ABOUT ME BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT\nI LOOK. >> PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THE\nOTHER SIDE OF THE COIN IS THAT CONSERVATIVES AND REPUBLICANS\nWHO WATCH THIS PLAY OUT OVER THE COURSE OF DECADES BEGAN TO GET\nTHE SENSE THAT WE CAN'T WIN. WE CAN PUT UP A GUY THAT'S\nTHOUGHTFUL AND CHARISMATIC AND THEY WILL DESTROY HIM AND CALL\nHIM A RACIST.

I'M SAYING THIS IS THE CALCULUS\nOF A LOT OF CONSERVATIVE PRIMARY VOTERS.\nRIGHT OR WRONG. >> WRONG.\n>> THEY ESSENTIALLY CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IF YOU NOMINATE\nA MARCO RUBIO HE'S GOING TO GET EATEN ALIVE BECAUSE WE NEED A\nTOUGH GUY THAT'S NOT GOING TO MAY BY THE RULES AND FIGHT FIRE\nWITH FIRE AND THAT'S NOT POLITICALLY CORRECT.\nI'M NOT SAYING THAT THAT'S WHY DONALD TRUMP WAS ELECTED.\nI'M SAYING IT'S ONE FACTOR AMONG MANY.\n>> HERE'S MY ISSUE WITH THAT. WHAT YOU'RE SAYING TO ME IS\nREPUBLICAN VOTERS MADE A DECISION THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE\nISSUES OF SEXISM, BIGOTRY, HOMOPHOBIA IN THIS COUNTRY,\nWE'RE GOING TO DOUBLE DOWN ON THAT BS AND GET SOMEBODY\nCOMPLETELY -- I'M NOT SAYING THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED.\nIT'S ONE OF THOSE -- WHAT I HEAR YOU SAYING IS -- RIGHT SO THE\nCHALLENGE I HAVE WITH THAT IS THERE ARE SOME REAL ISSUES IN\nTHIS COUNTRY WITH ALL OF THOSE THINGS.\nON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. AND I DON'T SEE DEM ROCRATS MOVG\nINTO A POSTURE BUT TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IMPLICIT BIAS AND IT\nWAS LIKE SHE WAS SAYING LET'S START WORLD WAR III.\n>> BUT BOTH SIDES ARE MORE POLARIZED.\n>> ABSOLUTELY. WHICH IS WHY I WAS MAKING FACES\nAT ANDRE EARLIER. >> HE WASN'T THE NORMAL\nREPUBLICAN AND HE WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT.\n>> BUT I THINK THE POINT HE WAS MAKING IS IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO\nWE PUT UP THERE YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE THE SAME COMMENTS AGAINST\nHIM WHETHER IT'S RIGHT OR WRONG. >> WHY DON'T YOU PUT SOMEONE UP\nTHERE THAT DOESN'T DO THAT. >> YOU'RE GOING TO CALL HIM A\nRACIST ANYWAY. >> THAT'S NOT TRUE.\n>> THERE'S PEOPLE THAT I HEAR MODERATE REPUBLICANS WHO SAY WHY\nDOES THE REPUBLICAN PARTY GET BOGGED DOWN IN THESE SOCIAL\nISSUES. IT DOES NOT HELP THEM.\nTHEY SHOULD GET OFF OF THAT AND THEY SHOULD BECOME A BIGGER TENT\nPARTY. >> AND THAT'S WHAT DONALD TRUMP\nIS. IF YOU TALK ABOUT MR. TRUMP IT'S\nABOUT HIS ECONOMY AND SECURITY. EVERYTHING ELSE IS LIKE LEAVE IT\nTO THE STATES WHEN IT COMES TO THE SOCIAL ISSUES.\n>> HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT CONSIDERING MANY OF THE THINGS\nTHAT HE SAID. >> BUT WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT\nTHINGS -- HE HAS TOLD HE HAS TO TALK ABOUT THOSE THINGS BUT WHEN\nIT COMES DOWN TO HIS POLICIES, WHY MOST AMERICANS LIKE HIM HE\nIS ASKED ABOUT HIS QUESTIONS BY REPORTERS.\n>> WE NORMALLY THINK ABOUT THINGS LIKE ABORTION AND GAY\nRIGHTS AND DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T TALK ABOUT THOSE ISSUES MUCH.\n>> THERE'S REASONS WHY HE SAID IT AND THEY DID ASK HIM THAT\nQUESTION AND HE DIDN'T RANDOMLY COME OUT AND SAY THAT.\n>> NO ONE MADE A RACIST STATEMENT ABOUT THE JUDGE.\n>> IT'S A RACIST STATEMENT IN YOUR\nMIND. >> THAT WAS NOT A RACIST SPEECH.\nAND THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO WERE SUPPORTING TRUMP, HE HAD A\nBETTER MOMENTUM CATAPULT THAN ANY OF THE OTHER CANDIDATES DID\nWITH HIS INITIAL SPEECH. ONCE AGAIN, IT DOESN'T MATTER\nWHO THE REPUBLICANS PUT FORWARD. IN FOUR YEARS YOU'RE GOING TO\nAPOLOGIZE AND SAY WE DIDN'T MEAN THAT.\nTHIS GUY IS WORSE. >> THIS IS WHY THAT STATEMENT IS\nNOT TRUE. BECAUSE IF YOU TAKE SOMEONE LIKE\nA MARCO RUBIO OR TAKE SOMEONE LIKE A JOHN KASICH, JOHN KASICH\nGOT 20% OF THE BLACK VOTE IN OHIO WHEN HE RAN FOR GOVERNOR\nAGAIN. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BACKGROUND\nOF THESE PEOPLE, YES, THEY'RE VERY CONSERVE.\nYES, I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH A LOT OF THEIR POLICIES.\nBUT THE FIRST THING THAT COMES THE MIND WHEN I SAUK ABOUT JOHN\nKASICH IS NOT XENOPHOBIA, IS NOT BIGOTRY.\n>> MATT, LET ME GIVE YOU ANOTHER EXAMPLE.\nLET ME GIVE YOU ANOTHER EXAMPLE. SOMEONE ALSO ON THE SPECTRUM\nTHAT WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT AS MUCH.\nMICHAEL STEELE. MICHAEL STEELE WHO WAS DEMONIZED\nBY THE GOP. MICHAEL STEELE WHO NOT ONLY\nGAINED A LOT OF GROUND AS CHAIRMAN, BUT ALSO WAS FIRED\nAFTER HE ENSURED THAT Y'ALL GOT BACK THE HOUSE.\n>> HE WAS ALSO DEMONIZED BY THE LEFT.\n>> SO THAT IS ONE OF THOSE -- THIS IS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS\nWHERE I'M ACKNOWLEDGING THAT.

I'M NOT DONE.\nHE SAID THAT DONALD TRUMP IS RACIST.\nTHAT IS IN YOUR PARTY. WHAT I'M SAYING TO YOU IS --\n>> I DON'T LIKE TRUMP EITHER. >> THE FACT HERE, CAN I TELL A\nFACT HERE? >> I GOT TO TAKE A BREAK.\n>> OKAY. REAL QUICK.\nTHE REASON WHY RNC WAS TAKEN FROM THE RNC IS THE AMOUNT OF\nDEBT HE RAN UP BEING THE CHAIRMAN.\nI LOVE MICHAEL STEELE, BUT HE PUT US THROUGH A LOT OF DEBT\nTHAT REINCE PRIEBUS HAS HAD TO WORK TO GET OUT OF.\n>> WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. >> FACTS MATTER.", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1478502407489.1478498825189.c7198368-f399-4a58-9c32-7cc714933abd.segment1.thumb.jpg", "channel": "202"}, {"start": 743625.0, "length": 263744.0, "end": 1007369, "date": 1478511269743, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1478513854735.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1478511128219-4820c1c9-2496-4d6b-a427-913958dcaa36-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=743.62,1007.37", "text": ">>> ALL RIGHT.\nWE ARE LESS THAN 24 HOURS UNTIL ELECTION DAY.\nLET'S DISCUSSION NOW WITH THE PANEL.\nJOINING US AGAIN, JOHN PHILLIPS.

PEOPLE LIKE JAY-Z AND BEYONCE\nWHO DON'T USUALLY COME OUT FOR CANDIDATES.\nBARACK OBAMA WAS A SPECIAL CASE.

WHEN WALKED OUT, DID PEOPLE COME\nUP AND SAY YOU CHANGED MY MIND? >> YES, QUITE A FEW.\nAND WE HAVE A LITTLE AFTER PARTY AT THE BAR ACROSS THE STREET AND\nWE HAD SO HAVE SECURITY THERE FOR OBVIOUS REASONS.\nI MEAN I'M IN A TOWN THAT THERE IS 26,000 REGISTERED VOTERS.\n1900 ARE REGISTERED DEMOCRATS OF THE 26,000.\nBUT I WANTED DO IT THERE.

AND I'D SAY OUT OF THE 100 TO\n150 TRUMP PEOPLE THAT WE HAD THERE, AT LEAST A DOZEN, MAYBE\nTWO DOZEN SAID THAT THEY WOULD GO HOME AND POSITION THINK ABOUT\nIT. AND THAT'S ALL I ASKED THEM DO.\nJUST BNK IT.TION THINK ABOUT IT.\nAND THAT'S ALL I ASKED THEM DO. JUST BNK IT.\n ABOUT IT. I DIDN'T WANT THE CRAZIES THERE,\nTHE DAVID DUKE ADMIRERS IN THE AUDIENCE BECAUSE WE'D NEVER GET\nTO THE SHOW DOWN. BUT WE WENT TO THE UNION HALLS\nLOOKING FOR DEMOCRATS NOW THINKING OF VOTING FOR TRUMP.\nAND ONE GUY SAID TO ME, HE SAID -- I SAID WHAT MADE YOU\nWHEN YOU SAID YOU WOULD THINK ABOUT IT, WHAT DID I SAY OR DO.\nHE SAID IT'S NOT WHAT YOU SAID. YOU SHOWED A PICTURE ON THE\nSCREEN OF HILLARY WHEN SHE WENT TO THE SMALL COUNTRY TO STUDY\nTHEIR HEALTH CARE BACK IN THE  '90s AND SHE WAS HOLDING A BABY\nAND HE SAID I'VE NEVER SEEN HER IN THAT LIGHT.\nHER CAMPAIGN OR HERSELF HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO SHOW YOU WHO SHE\nIS.

WHY AM I DOING THAT?\nWELL, I'M TRYING TO CONVINCE PEOPLE.\nI'M NOT JUST SLOUCHING IN HERE ON A WEEKEND MORNING TO TALK TO\nYOU. I PUT SOME THOUGHT INTO THIS\nBECAUSE I CARE. AND SO THE HILLARY CAMPAIGN, YOU\nKNOW, I DON'T -- I DON'T KNOW. HAVE YOU EVER MET HER?\n>> I HAVE. >> I MEAN, I MET HER, GOT\nINVITED TO A WHITE HOUSE DINNER THEN BILL WAS PRESIDENT, SO I\nMET HER THERE. I MET HER TWO OTHER TIMES IN\nVARIOUS ROOMS OR WHATEVER. POLITICAL THINGS.\nAND I GOT TO TELL YOU, SHE IS FRIENDLY, SHE IS PERSONABLE, SHE\nIS FUNNY. SHE HAS A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR.\nAND I'M LIKE HOW COME WE DON'T SEE THAT A.\nI WISH WE SAW MORE OF THAT. I MET AL GORE A COUPLE YEARS\nAFTER HE WON AND LOST. AND I SPENT A COUPLE HOURS WITH\nHIM. AND HE WAS FUNNY AND LIKEABLE\nAND PERSONABLE. NOT A STIFF AT ALL.\nAND I SAID HOW COME WE DIDN'T GET TO SEE WILL GUY WHEN YOU\nWERE RUNNING? AND HE GOES, I KNOW, I KNOW.\n>> AND THERE YOU HAVE IT. >> THERE YOU HAVE IT.\nIT IF YOU WANT TO TAKE MY WORD FOR IT, HAVING BEEN AROUND HER A\nLITTLE BIT, AND EVEN THOUGH I HAVEN'T VOTED FOR HER, AND EVEN\nTHOUGH I HAVE DISAGREEMENTS, HER VOTE ON THE WAR, WALL STREET\nSTUFF, ALL THAT, I GOT TO TELL YOU, HER SITTING IN THE OVAL\nOFFICE, I FEEL VERY GOOD ABOUT THAT.\nI CAN'T SEE HER SIGNING A BILL AT THAT DESK THAT HURTS\nCHILDREN. I CAN'T SEE HER LETTING ANYTHING\nPASS BY HER THAT WILL HURT PEOPLE.\nSHE WON'T APPOINT JUSTICES TO THE SUPREME COURT THAT SAYS I\nHAVE A RIGHT TO CONTROL YOUR REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS.\nSHE WILL APPOINT PEOPLE WHO SAY YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO LIVE AND LET\nLIVE AND BE FREE AS AN AMERICAN.

YOU ASKED ABOUT HOW PRESIDENT\nOBAMA TALKS TO HIS DAUGHTERS ABOUT TRUMP'S SEXISM.\nLET'S TAKE A LOOK. >> I THINK THAT THEY ARE\nSURPRISED THAT PEOPLE WOULD BE WILLING TO OVERLOOK SUCH BLATANT\nDISRESPECT OF WOMEN, THAT THEY WOULD OVERLOOK SOMEBODY BRAGGING\nON TAPE OF ACTIONS THAT PRETTY MUCH DESCRIBE SEXUAL ASSAULT.\nYOU CAN'T OVERLOOK SOMETHING AS FUNDAMENTAL AS THAT BECAUSE PART\nOF BEING PRESIDENT IS YOU'RE REPRESENTING ALL PEOPLE AND YOU\nSAID WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE LOOKING OUT FOR\nEVERYBODY. >> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE WAY\nYOUNG MILLENNIAL WOMEN ARE REACTING TO WHAT THEY'RE HEARING\nFROM DONALD TRUMP? >> I THINK IT WAS AN IMPORTANT\nQUESTION TO ASK. AS WE KNOW, PRESIDENT OBAMA\nCOMES FROM A FAMILY OF VERY STRONG WOMEN.\nHIS OLDEST DAUGHTER VOTED FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS YEAR, SO WE\nWENT WITH THAT ANGLE IN MIND. WE HAVE AN OVERWHELMINGLY YOUNG\nAUDIENCE AND A LOT OF WOMEN IN OUR AUDIENCE AND IT'S SOMETHING\nTHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ALL CAMPAIGN LONG.\nBUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU ALWAYS GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO\nHEAR FIRSTHAND FROM THE PRESIDENT, HOW ARE YOU TALKING\nTO YOUR OWN DAUGHTERS ABOUT THE THINGS THAT WE'RE HEARING IN THE\nMEDIA EVERY DAY. AND I THINK THAT HE MADE AN\nIMPORTANT POINT, THAT WHEN YOU HEAR THESE SORT OF VULGAR THINGS\nCOMING OUTOF DONALD TRUMP'S MOUTH, AS YOU HEAR HIM BASICALLY\nDESCRIBE SEXUAL ASSAULT AND CONTINUE TO SEE PEOPLE\nSUPPORTING HIM, WOMEN AND ESPECIALLY YOUNG WOMEN ARE\nTAKING A STEP BACK AND SAYING OKAY, WHAT DOES THIS MEAN ABOUT\nUS. WHAT DOES IT MEAN ABOUT THE WAY\nWE'RE TREATED AND VALUED. >> AND YOU'RE WORKING WITH MTV\nNEWSES WHICH PLAYS TO A YOUNGER DEMOGRAPHIC OF PEOPLE.\nHOW DO YOU THINK THAT CONVERSATION IS TAKING PLACE AND\nIN TERMS OF MEDIA, HOW ARE YOU GUYS HANDLING IT THAT ISSUE?\n>> WE'RE TUNED IN TO THE CONCEPTS OF RAPE CULTURE, TOXIC\nMASCULINITY, THINGS THAT MAY BE COMMON VOCABULARY BUT NOT SO\nMUCH NATIONWIDE SENSE.

WHAT I WILL SAY FROM A RUSSIAN\nPERSPECTIVE IS THAT YOU NOW HAVE A WINDOW, PROBABLY 36 HOURS,\nWHERE YOU COULD DROP FAKE E-MAILS.\nBECAUSE NO ONE COULD DEBUNCT IT. THE STORY WOULD BLOW UP.\nTHIS WOULD BE THE MOMENT FOR THE TRULY FAKED E-MAILS.\nSO YOU CAN SCORE IT EITHER WAY IN TERMS OF EARLY VORACITY OR\nNOT. >> IT WOULD ALSO BE GREAT TO\nPRE-EMPT ANY REAL E-MAILS THAT CAME BY CASTING DOUBT ON WHETHER\nTHEY ARE REAL AND THEN THE ELECTION GOES BY BEFORE YOU'RE\nABLE TO DO IT.

ARE YOU READY?\n>> I'M READY. >> THIS IS THE FINAL SPRINT TO\nTHE FINISH. DONALD TRUMP IS TESTING HIS\nAPPEAL TO VOTERS OUTSIDE THE GOP HEARTLAND BY HOLDING RALLIES\nTODAY IN IOWA, MINNESOTA, MICHIGAN, PENNSYLVANIA, AND\nVIRGINIA, STATES WON BY PRESIDENT OBAMA FOUR YEARS AGO.\nHILLARY CLINTON IS IN PENNSYLVANIA, OHIO, AND NEW\nHAMPSHIRE, TRADITIONAL BATTLEGROUND STATES WHERE SOME\nPOLLING HAS SHOWN EITHER SHE IS LOCKED IN A VIRTUAL TIE OR NOW\nTRAILING TRUMP. IN FLORIDA LATE YESTERDAY THE\nDEMOCRATIC NOMINEE HIT WITH A DEUGE OF RAIN BUT KEPT MAKING\nHER CASE THROUGH THE RAIN DROPS. >> NOW, MY FRIENDS, YOU ARE A\nHEARTY BUNCH STANDING OUT HERE IN THE RAIN.\nI DON'T THINK I NEED TO TELL YOU ALL OF THE WRONG THINGS ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP, BUT HERE IS WHAT I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER.\nI WANT TO BE THE PRESIDENT FOR EVERYBODY, EVERYBODY WHO AGREES\nWITH ME, PEOPLE WHO DON'T AGREE WITH ME, PEOPLE WHO VOTE FOR ME,\nPEOPLE WHO DON'T VOTE FOR ME. >> I THINK SHE WAS LAUGHING AT\nTHE RAIN THERE.

SHE'S GOING ALL OVER THE PLACE.\nSHE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HOME SLEEPING.\nMICHIGAN WAS NEVER REALLY IN PLAY FOR A REPUBLICAN, BUT YOU\nKNOW WHAT? IT'S IN PLAY FOR US BECAUSE ALL\nOF THEIR CARS ARE BEING MADE NOW IN MEXICO.\n>> SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT JOHN ROBERTS IS TRAVELING WITH\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN BRINGING US THE NEWS FROM SIOUX CITY, IOWA,\nA STATE MR. TRUMP HOPES TO FLIP TUESDAY.\nGOOD TO SEE YOU, JOHN. >> Reporter: HEY, GOOD TO SEE\nYOU TOO. ABOUT 5,000 PEOPLE SHOULD BE\nHERE AT THE CONVENTION CENTER IN SIOUX CITY FOR THE DONALD TRUMP\nRALLY WHICH BEGINS IN ABOUT AN HOUR'S TIME.\nSOME TENSE MOMENTS IN THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL YESTERDAY IN ROW RENO WHEN FOR THE SECOND TIME\nSECRET SERVICE AGENTS JUMPED ON STAGE TO PROTECT THE CANDIDATE.\nIT HAPPENED IN OHIO IN MARCH WHEN SOMEBODY TRIED TO RUSH THE\nSTAGE. YESTERDAY SOMEBODY AT THE FRONT\nOF THE RALLY STARTED YELLING GUN, GUN.\nA SENIOR SECURITY AIDE TOLD ME WHAT SEEMED TO HAPPEN WAS A\nPROTESTER WAS TRYING TO TAKE SOMETHING OUT OF HIS WAISTBAND.\nTHE PEOPLE WHO WERE GATHERED AROUND HIM WERE TRYING TO FIGURE\nOUT WHAT HE WAS TRYING TO DO, WAS IT A SIGN OR WAS IT\nPOTENTIALLY A WEAPON. SOMEBODY THOUGHT IT WAS A WEAPON\nAND STARTED SHOUTING GUN. THAT'S WHEN SECURITY CAME OVER\nTHE FENCE, PUT THE GUY ON THE FLOOR, AND HAULED HIM AWAY.\nAUSTIN CRITES SAID ALL HE WAS TRYING TO DO WAS PULL OUT A SIGN\nTHAT SAID REPUBLICANS AGAIN TRUMP.\nHE SAID HE'S A LIFE LONG REPUBLICAN BUT HE CAN'T SUPPORT\nDONALD TRUMP IN THIS CAMPAIGN. IN THE STATE OF NEVADA, DONALD\nTRUMP HAS GOT SOME WORK TO DO. HE NEEDS TO COUNTER A MASSIVE\nSURGE IN HISPANIC VOTES THAT HAVE COME OUT IN EARLY VOTING.\nWITH THAT RALLY LAST NIGHT APPEALING TO VOTERS IN WASHO\nCOUNTY AND ELKO IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE TO GET OUT ON\nELECTION DAY AND PUT HIM OVER THE TOP.\nHERE IS WHAT HE SAID. >> RENO AND NORTHERN NEVADA CAN\nCARRY THIS STATE AND CAN CARRY US ALL THE WAY TO WASHINGTON AND\nTHE WHITE HOUSE. THIS WILL BE OUR LAST CHANCE,\nBUT DON'T LET CRAZY, BROKEN HARRY REID AND HIS CORRUPT\nPOLITICAL MACHINE DECIDE THIS ELECTION FOR YOU.\n>> Reporter: IF DONALD TRUMP HOPES TO WIN THE WHITE HOUSE, HE\nNEEDS TO WIN ALL FIVE BATTLEGROUNDS THAT HE CURRENTLY\nLEADS IN PLUS THE STATE OF FLORIDA PLUS THE SECOND\nCONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT IN MAINE. HE'S ALSO TRIED TO EXPAND THE\nMAP AT THE SAME TIME GOING TO STATES LIKE MINNESOTA.\nTODAY HE'S ALSO GOING TO MICHIGAN AND VIRGINIA.\nYOU KNOW, AT THIS POINT IT LOOKS LIKE THIS COULD BE A CLOSE RACE,\nSO THAT AGAIN RAISES THE QUESTION IF IT DOESN'T TURN OUT\nIN DONALD TRUMP'S FAVOR, WILL HE ACCEPT THE RESULTS OF THE\nELECTION? CHRIS WALLACE PUT THAT QUESTION\nTO HIS RUNNING MATE, MIKE PENCE, EARLIER TODAY ON FOX NEWS\nSUNDAY. LET'S LISTEN TO THAT EXCHANGE.\n>> CAN YOU GUARANTEE HE'LL PUT THIS BEHIND US AND ACCEPT THE\nRESULTS? >> THE CAMPAIGN -- YEAH, THE\nCAMPAIGN HAS MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT, YOU KNOW, A CLEAR OUTCOME,\nOBVIOUSLY BOTH SIDES WILL ACCEPT, BUT I THINK BOTH\nCAMPAIGNS HAVE ALSO BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT, YOU KNOW, IN THE\nEVENT OF DISPUTED RESULTS, THEY RESERVE ALL LEGAL RIGHTS AND\nREMEDIES. >> Reporter: AND EARLY VOTING\nENDS IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA TODAY.\nALL THE COUNTIES WILL BE WRAPPED UP BY THIS EVENING, HARRIS, AND\nWHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW IS IN THE OVERALL TALLY BETWEEN ABSENTEE\nMAIL-IN VOTES AND IN-PERSON VOTES, DEMOCRATS HAVE A LEAD OF\n32,000 IN THEIR REGISTERED VOTERS COMING OUT.\nTHAT IS MUCH BETTER FOR\nREPUBLICANS IN 2012 WHEN THEY WERE BEHIND BY 110,000, BUT THEY\nSTILL NEED TO GET A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT TO THE POLLS THERE ON\nTUESDAY, SO THAT'S WHY DONALD TRUMP WILL BE GOING BACK TO\nFLORIDA AGAIN TOMORROW. IN TOTAL HE'S DOING TEN EVENTS\nIN TEN STATES BETWEEN TODAY AND TOMORROW.\nVERY BUSY TRAVEL SCHEDULE. HARRIS?\n>> AND IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE ALLUDING TO IS THE\nINTENSITY OF VOTERSHIP DOWN IN FLORIDA FOR DONALD TRUMP VERSUS\nHILLARY CLINTON WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW MANY ARE REGISTERED AT THIS\nPOINT. WE APPRECIATE IT.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH. THE NEWS CONTINUES NOW.\nLET'S GO TO HILLARY CLINTON WHO IS STARTING HER DAY IN THE\nBATTLEGROUND STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA.\nLATER TODAY SHE'LL HEAD TO OHIO AND NEW HAMPSHIRE WHERE SHE'LL\nFOCUS ON ENERGIZING VOTERS WHO USUALLY SUPPORT THE DEMOCRATIC\nNOMINEE, BUT APPARENTLY THEY NEED AN EXTRA BOOST AT THIS\nPOINT. SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT\nMIKE EMANUEL IS LIVE FROM PHILADELPHIA.\n>> GOOD AFTERNOON TO YOU. HILLARY CLINTON IS EXPECTED TO\nMAKE A COUPLE UNANNOUNCED STOPS BEFORE LEAVING PHILADELPHIA.\nSHE'S ON HER WAY TO CHURCH RIGHT NOW AND THEN WILL HEAD ONTO\nTHOSE OTHER KEY STATES. THE CLINTON TEAM IS SENDING\nADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO MICHIGAN.\nI SHOULD NOTE HILLARY CLINTON WAS JUST IN MICHIGAN ON FRIDAY.\nHER HUSBAND, THE FORMER PRESIDENT, WILL CAMPAIGN THERE\nTODAY. PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL RALLY\nSUPPORT THERE TOMORROW. MICHIGAN IS TYPICALLY A SAFE\nSTATE FOR DEMOCRATS, BUT PERHAPS THERE IS SOMETHING THERE TO\nWATCH. HER RUNNING MATE, TIM KAINE, IS\nALSO IN THE MIDWEST TODAY. HE'S IN WISCONSIN, AND HE TALKED\nTO SUPPORTERS ABOUT FINISHING THE JOB.\n>> IF YOU'RE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING FOR THE FIRST TIME\nTHAT'S NEVER BEEN DONE, YOU'RE TRYING TO, YOU KNOW, BE A PATH\nBREAKER WHEN IT'S NEVER HAPPENED, YOU HAVE TO ASSUME\nTHAT IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH, MAKING HISTORY IS TOUGH.\nDOING THINGS FOR THE FIRST TIME IS TOUGH AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE\nTO STAY DISCIPLINED AND BATTLE ALL THE WAY TO THE END.\n>> Reporter: LAST NIGHT HERE IN PHILADELPHIA HILLARY CLINTON HAD\nSOME MORE CELEBRITY HELP IN THE FORM OF KATY PERRY DOING A\nCONCERT FOR SUPPORTERS HERE IN THE CITY OF BROTHERLY LOVE.\nPERRY TOLD YOUNG SUPPORTERS THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR SITTING\nTHIS ELECTION OUT, AND CLINTON PAID TRIBUTE TO THE POP STAR FOR\nHER MESSAGE OF TOUGHNESS. >> WHEN YOU GET KNOCKED DOWN,\nWHICH EVERYBODY DOES, WHAT MATTERS IS GET BACK UP.\nSTAND UP FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE. KNOW THE POWER OF YOUR OWN\nVOICE. IT CAN CHANGE THE WORLD.\n>> Reporter: CLINTON IS NOT DONE HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA.\nSHE'S GOING TO MAKE TWO STOPS HERE TOMORROW, INCLUDING A RALLY\nWITH THE PRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY HERE ON ELECTION EVE, AND,\nHARRIS, MAY I JUST NOTE, I'M TRULY JEALOUS OF STEVE HAYES.\nHE IS ONE LUCKY GUY. >> YOU'RE SO SWEET.\nWE'RE JEALOUS OF YOU BECAUSE WE LIKE TO BE OUT IN THE FIELD AS\nWELL. MAYBE WE'LL SWAP SOMETIMES.\n>> COME ON DOWN. >> I HEAR THE WATER IS WARM.\nLET'S START WITH PENNSYLVANIA. AT FIRST I WAS A LITTLE BAFFLED,\nBUT I SAW EARLIER ON FOX NEWS WE WERE TALKING WITH A MEMBER OF\nTHE CAMPAIGN FOR CLINTON, THEY'RE POURING ALL THEIR EGGS\nINTO PENNSYLVANIA BECAUSE THEY THINK IF THEY CAN STOP TRUMP\nTHERE, WHAT HAPPENS? >> I WOULD SAY PENNSYLVANIA AND\nMICHIGAN, RIGHT? THEY SEEM TO BE --\n>> WELL, MICHIGAN IS ANOTHER STORY BECAUSE OF THE BLACK AND\nPOOR VOTE THERE, BUT YEAH. >> TRUMP HAS TARGETED\nPENNSYLVANIA IN PARTICULAR, ALSO MICHIGAN SORT OF FROM THE\nBEGINNING. HIS ARGUMENT HAS BEEN I CAN WIN\nTHIS, YOU KNOW, DOWN-SCALE VOTE. PEOPLE ARE FRUSTRATED WITH THE\nECONOMY IN PLACES LIKE PENNSYLVANIA, IN PLACES LIKE\nMICHIGAN. THAT'S GOING TO PROPEL ME TO\nVICTORY. WE'RE SEEING NOW THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN SAY THIS IS WHERE WE'RE GOING TO STOP YOU.\nTHIS IS WHERE WE'RE GOING TO KEEP YOU FROM BUILDING MOMENTUM\nTO TAKE YOU THROUGH TUESDAY. I THINK WHAT'S INTERESTING IN\nMICHIGAN IN PARTICULAR IS HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN BACK UP\nON THE AIR WITH THESE SCORCHED EARTH ADS GOING AFTER DONALD\nTRUMP, REALLY TAKING IT TO HIM, AND IT SUGGESTS TO ME THAT THERE\nMUST BE SOMETHING IN THE POLLING THAT THEY ARE SEEING, THAT THE\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN IS SEEING, TO SPEND AS MUCH TIME AS THEY'RE\nSPENDING THERE. >> WHAT COULD IT BE?\n>> I THINK IT'S FAIR TO CONCLUDE THEY SEE THE RACE TIGHTENING IN\nMICHIGAN IN PARTICULAR. >> VERY INTERESTING.\nTHE ECONOMY IS REALLY MOTIVATING A LOT OF PEOPLE.\n>> THAT'S WHAT THIS ELECTION IS COMING DOWN TO.\nWHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE BLACK VOTE AND THE BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT\nRATE IN THIS COUNTRY IS BASICALLY TWICE THE NATIONAL\nAVERAGE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT, THAT'S A HUGE ISSUE, AND ESPECIALLY IN\nSOME OF THE MIDWEST CITIES. LOOKING DOWN IN FLORIDA SPEAKING\nOF THE BLACK VOTE AND THE TURNOUT, NOT WHAT IT WAS FOR\nOBAMA. WHERE ARE YOU MOST WORRIED IF\nYOU'RE DONALD TRUMP RIGHT NOW? >> I MEAN, I THINK HE'S BEEN\nCOMPETITIVE IN FLORIDA. THE EARLY VOTE SUGGESTS HE'S\nOUTPERFORMING WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN 2012.\nI THINK THE PROBLEM FOR DONALD TRUMP, AND WE'RE SEEING IT\nREFLECTED IN HIS TRAVEL SCHEDULE AT THE END, HE CAN'T FOCUS ON\nJUST A STATE OR TWO. HE'S GOT TO TRY TO GET TO SIX OR\nSEVEN DIFFERENT STATES WHEREAS HILLARY CLINTON THINKS SHE CAN\nSAY IF I STOP HIM HERE AND STOP HIM THERE, I BLOCK HIS PATH TO\n270. >> INTERESTING.\nALL RIGHT. WELL, ONE THING WE HAVEN'T\nTALKED MUCH ABOUT IS THE WEATHER.\nTHEY BOTH HAVE THEIR OWN PLANES SO THEY CAN SKIP AROUND TOWN\nBASICALLY ALL THE WAY THROUGH TUESDAY AS WE LOOK AT THE\nNATIONAL MAP. THE WEATHER LOOKS GOOD FOR\nTUESDAY NIGHT. WHO DO YOU THINK IT BENEFITS?\n>> THE WEATHER BEING GOOD? >> YEAH, BECAUSE THAT MEANS MORE\nPEOPLE WILL GET OUT TO VOTE. IT'S A THING.\nWE TALK ABOUT IT. >> I KEEP HAVING FLASHBACKS TO\nTHE FINAL FOUR DAYS OF MY FATHER'S CAMPAIGN WHERE WE DID\n24 HOURS STRAIGHT ON A PLANE, AND THIS FOR ANY CAMPAIGN, BOTH\nCAMPAIGNS RIGHT NOW, TO SAY THIS IS LIKE ULTIMATE MODE, WHERE\nYOU'RE RUNNING ON ADRENALINE. I DON'T THINK THEY CARE.\nI THINK THEY'RE JUST GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS.\nI KNOW HOW EXHAUSTED THESE PEOPLE ARE AND THEIR TEAMS ARE.\nI ALWAYS WONDER WHAT THE FINAL DAYS OF RALLIES DOES OTHER THAN\nEXCITE YOUR BASE AND TRY TO KEEP UP THE MOMENTUM AND APPEARANCES\nFOR EACH CANDIDATE. I KIND OF THINK THE CAKE IS\nBAKED TO REALLY A VERY LARGE EXTENT AT THIS POINT.\n>> ALL RIGHT. SO WE DO HAVE SOME STATES WHERE\nWE WILL HAVE GAME DAY VOTING, WHERE THEY DIDN'T HAVE EARLY\nIN-PERSON VOTING. PENNSYLVANIA IS ONE OF THOSE\nCOUNTS. YOU ASK WHY THEY WOULD HAVE A\nRALLY. HILLARY CLINTON WAS DOING THE\nCONCERT THING BECAUSE IN PART WHEN YOU GIVE AWAY FREE TICKETS\nYOU'RE ABLE TO DO WHAT? YOU CAN GET INFORMATION FROM\nTHAT PERSON. YOU CAN MOBILIZE THAT PERSON.\nYOU CAN ORGANIZE THAT PERSON TO GO OUT AND VOTE.\nWE'RE STILL AHEAD OF ELECTION DAY.\nSO THAT'S A THOUGHT. WHAT DO YOU THINK?\n>> DEFINITELY, AND PENNSYLVANIA IS EXACTLY AS YOU PUT IT, A\nPLACE WHERE THERE IS NO EARLY VOTING.\nTHEY HAVE TO GET THEM TO THE POLLS ON TUESDAY.\nSHE HAS TO DO WELL IN PLACES, PHILLY ALONE, BUT NOT JUST\nPHILLY, BUCKS COUNTY, MONTGOMERY COUNTY.\nTHAT WILL MAKE OR BREAK THIS ELECTION.\nTHAT'S WHERE, I HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE, WHITE COLLEGE\nEDUCATED WOMEN TEND TO LIVE. A DEMOGRAPHIC THAT'S\nTRADITIONALLY GONE FOR REPUBLICANS.\nIT WENT FOR ROMNEY BY SIX POINTS LAST TIME.\nSHE'S UP ACCORDING TO \"THE WASHINGTON POST\" BY 27 WITH THAT\nDEMOGRAPHIC. THAT'S WHAT SHE'S FOCUSING ON.\nTHAT'S WHY YOU'RE SEEING HER APPEAL ON SPECIFICALLY WOMEN'S\nISSUES. THAT'S HER FIREWALL, THE WHITE\nCOLLEGE EDUCATED WOMEN THAT LIVE IN THOSE --\n>> YOU'RE REALLY HUNG UP ON THIS.\nYOU SAY THIS ON EVERY SHOW. >> I THINK THAT'S A LARGE PART\nOF WHAT DETERMINES THIS RACE. SOMETHING ELSE THAT DETERMINES\nTHIS RACE LIKE YOU HAVE SEEN IN CLARK COUNTY AND BROWARD COUNTY,\nFLORIDA, IS LATINOS. WHETHER THEY'RE SURGING FOR HER\nOR SURGING AGAINST TRUMP. WHAT YOU SEE IN CLARK COUNTY,\nNEVADA, IS THAT NEVADA IS ESSENTIALLY PRECLUDED FOR TRUMP\nUNLESS HE HAS A MIRACLE ON ELECTION DAY.\n>> IT'S AN EXCELLENT POINT ABOUT THE LATINO VOTE.\nWAS IT HIM TO MOBILIZE PEOPLE TO VOTE AGAINST HIM WITH SOME OF\nTHE THINGS HE SAID OR MAYBE SHE DID SOMETHING TO GET THEM ON HER\nSIDE? BUT WHAT WOULD THAT HAVE BEEN?\n>> SHE SAID -- SHE GAVE A STUMP SPEECH AND SAID WE'RE ALL COMING\nOUT AND YOU'RE VOTING FOR ME, FOR MY AGENDA AND IN REALITY THE\nOPPOSITE IS MORE LIKELY TRUE. PEOPLE ARE VOTING AGAINST TRUMP.\n>> EXCITED TO BE HERE ON A PRE-ELECTION SPECIAL EDITION\nSUNDAY OF \"OUTNUMBERED\" AND ON ELECTION DAY FOX NEWS CHANNEL IS\nTHE ONLY PLACE TO BE. YOU KNOW THAT.\nFROM DAWN UNTIL THE WEE HOURS OF THE NEXT MORNING.\nWE WILL HAVE COVERAGE FROM ACROSS AMERICA AND THE VERY BEST\nANALYSIS FOR YOU, AND WE WANT YOU TO BE PART OF OUR ELECTION\nNIGHT COVERAGE, SO IF YOU VOTED OR ARE GETTING READY TO VOTE,\nPOST YOUR PICTURE ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER, OR INSTAGRAM WITH THE\nHASH TAG FOX NEWS 2016.

BOTH TRUMP AND CLINTON NOW\nFOCUSING ON FIRING UP THOSE SUPPORTERS AND GETTING OUT THE\nVOTE. >> SO MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST\nTHEIR FAITH IN THE FUTURE AND THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY.\nOUR GOVERNMENT HAS FAILED OUR CITIZENS. BUT WE ARE GOING TO TURN IT ALL\nAROUND AND DELIVER THE CHANGE AND LEADERSHIP THAT AMERICA\nDESERVES. THIS IS THE MOVEMENT LIKE OUR\nCOUNTRY HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE. >> I WANT TO BE THE PRESIDENT\nFOR EVERYBODY, EVERYBODY WHO AGREES WITH ME, PEOPLE WHO DON'T\nAGREE WITH ME, PEOPLE WHO VOTE FOR ME, PEOPLE WHO DON'T VOTE\nFOR ME. SO LET'S GET OUT, LET'S VOTE FOR\nTHE FUTURE, LET'S VOTE FOR WHAT WE WANT FOR OUR COUNTRY AND OUR\nCHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN. GOD BLESS YOU!\n>> WHOO! HOTDOG!\nWE HAVE TEAM FOX COVERAGE. RICH AND MIKE ARE FOLLOWING BOTH\nCAMPAIGNS. WANT TO START IN NEW YORK THOUGH\nWITH SPECIAL REPORT ANCHOR BRET BAIER.\n>> SHE'S FIRED UP AND READY TO GO.\n>> INDEED. NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.\nIT HAPPENS WHEN THE RAIN COMES DOWN FROM THE SKIES.\nSEEING A BUNCH OF THINGS OUT THERE TODAY.\n>> YEAH. >> NOTAGELY EARLY VOTING IN\nNORTH CAROLINA APPEARS TO BE FAVORABLE TOWARDS REPUBLICAN.\nEARLY VOTING IN FLORIDA SEEMS TO BE ABSOLUTELY NECK AND NECK.\nWHAT'S YOUR ANALYSIS? >> SO I THINK THOSE ARE GOOD\nTHINGS FOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN OBVIOUSLY.\nIT ALL COMES DOWN TO TURNOUT. WE SAY THAT ALL THE TIME, BUT AS\nYOU GET CLOSER TO THE DAY, IT REALLY IS ABOUT THE TURNOUT\nOPERATION AND WHO CAN GET THEIR SUPPORTERS TO THE POLLS.\nI THINK WE'RE SEEING MIXED MESSAGES EARLIER.\nIN NEVADA, JON RALSTON REALLY HAS A SENSE OF THE HISPANIC\nTURNOUT THERE IN NEVADA. THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS JUMPED\nON THAT AND THEY SAY THEIR INTERNAL NUMBERS SHOW THAT, YOU\nKNOW, TRUMP WOULD HAVE TO BE -- OUTPERFORM BY TEN POINTS ON\nELECTION DAY TO PULL THAT OFF. YOU KNOW, SOME OF THAT IS SPIN,\nBUT SOME OF IT IS REAL, ON-THE-GROUND FACTS.\nI THINK WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO IS THE MIDWEST AND WHERE THAT\nTURNOUT IS IN THOSE KEY STATES, SOME OF THEME PREVIOUS BLUE\nSTATES THAT TRUMP IS OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO PICK OFF.\n>> SO YOU'VE GOT IOWA. WE'LL SEE THAT ANY MOMENT NOW\nAND MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA, THAT HAS NOT VOTED FOR A REPUBLICAN\nSINCE 1972. >> YEAH.\n>> THAT IS STOP NUMBER TWO JUST TO FINISH YOUR POINT.\nIT'S BACK TO MICHIGAN, BACK TO PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, AND\nTHEN BACK TO NORTHERN VIRGINIA. >> AND THE A PRESIDENT OBAMA AR\nCAMPAIGNING IN MICHIGAN IS EITHER, ONE, TRYING TO SHORE UP\nWHAT THEY BELIEVE IS GOING TO BE A WIN THERE OR A SIGN THAT\nTHEY'RE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SHIFT THAT THE THEY'VE SEEN\nIN SOME OF THOSE RUST BELT STATES IN PARTICULAR.\n>> REINCE PRIEBUS DID AN INTERVIEW EARLIER TODAY AND HE\nINSISTS THAT MICHIGAN IS A COIN TOSS.\n>> THAT THE WOULD BE GSH -- THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING.\n>> TRUMP ADDED ANOTHER STOP IN GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN.\n11:00 P.M. EAST COAST TIME. >> WHERE THEY GO IN THE FINAL\nTWO DAYS TELLS YOU A LOT. AND IT TELLS YOU THAT'S WHERE\nTHE FOCUS IS. I DO THINK THAT NORTH CAROLINA\nIS A REAL BATTLEGROUND, AND THAT'S GOING TO BE A KEY ON\nTUESDAY NIGHT. I THINK THAT FLORIDA OBVIOUSLY\nALWAYS IS, BUT THE PATH THAT HE HAS TO TAKE TO 270 HAS TO STRING\nA LOT OF STATES TOGETHER. >> AND WE LOOKED AT THAT\nYESTERDAY WHEN WE WERE MESSING AROUND ON THE MAP TOGETHER, AND\nIT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE CERTAINLY, BUT HE NEEDS A LOT OF THINGS TO\nBREAK HIS WAY. >> YEAH.\n>> AND FOR HER IT'S EASIER. >> THEY COULD, IF IT SHIFTS TWO\nPOINTS IN SOME OF THESE STATES OR THE POLLS ARE UNDER\nREPORTING -- AS YOU GET CLOSER, THE POLLS ARE PRETTY ACCURATE ON\nAVERAGE HISTORICALLY WHEN YOU GET TO ELECTION DAY.\nBUT IF THEY'RE OFF TWO POINTS, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A BIG\nSWING. >> IT'S A VERY INTERESTING\nPOINT. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT JUST\nGENERALLY SPEAKING McCAIN COMPARED TO ROMNEY AS YOU FLIP\nTHROUGH THESE COUNTIES AND STATES, WHAT YOU FIND IS A\nTWO-POINT DIFFERENCE. MEANING ROMNEY DID TWO POINTS\nBETTER THAN McCAIN AND OVERALL IT WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO WIN\nHIM THE WHITE HOUSE. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING TO\nWATCH TOO, AND WE'LL BE LOOKING AT THE DEMOGRAPHICS AND SEEING\nWHAT THE PERCENTAGE OF THE VOTE IS DEPENDING ON THE STATE.\n>> AND IT WILL BE FASCINATING. >> AND I THINK TOO THAT, YOU\nKNOW, WITH EARLY VOTING BEING SO MUCH MORE POPULAR THAN IT'S EVER\nBEEN, I THINK THE QUESTION IS, WELL, ARE THOSE NEWER VOTERS OR\nARE THOSE FOLKS THAT JUST NOW MORE AND MORE PEOPLE HAVE THE\nOPPORTUNITY TO GET IT OVER WITH EARLY.\n>> THAT'S RIGHT. FIRST OF ALL, LET'S JUST CONCEDE\nTHAT THIS IS TRUE, A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT THIS ELECTION TO BE\nOVER. I MEAN REALLY OVER.\nAND I THINK THAT THE ENTHUSIASM, IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLLS, IT'S\nNOT AS HIGH AS IT WAS BECAUSE THEY HAVE THESE HIGH NEGATIVES.\nNOW, YOU TALK TO TRUMP PEOPLE AND THEY'RE LIKE LOOK AT THE\nCROWDS, LOOK AT THE ENTHUSIASM, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLL\nNUMBERS, IT'S A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN ROMNEY, WHICH IS HARD TO\nBELIEVE. >> YEAH.\nSIOUX CITY, IOWA, HERE IN A MOMENT.\nI'M GOING TO MISS IT WHEN IT'S OVER.\n>> REALLY? >> I'M ONE OF THOSE RARE BIRDS.\nTHANK YOU, BRET. >> IT'S FUN.\n>> SEE YOU LATER TONIGHT AND AGAIN ON TUESDAY.\n>> AS YOU GUYS WERE JUST SAYING, DONALD TRUMP IS IN FIVE STATES\nTHIS AFTERNOON PUSHING TO BRING THAT FINAL MESSAGE HOME TO\nVOTERS. HE WILL BE IN IOWA JUST A FEW\nMINUTES FROM NOW. WE'LL TAKE YOU THERE LIVE TO SEE\nTHAT. BUSY TRAVEL DAY, OF COURSE, AND\nIT FOLLOWS A SECURITY SCARE IN RENO, NEVADA, LAST NIGHT.\nHAVE YOU SEEN THIS? A SCARY MOMENT.\nTHE SECRET SERVICE RUSHED MR. TRUMP OFF THE STAGE AFTER\nSOMEONE IN THE CROWD SHOUTED THE WORD GUN.\nSECURITY OFFICIALS DETAINED A MAN, LATER SAYING THAT NO\nWEAPONS WERE FOUND. RICH EDSON IS LIVE IN SIOUX\nCITY, IOWA. GOOD AFTERNOON TO YOU.\nWHAT IS DONALD TRUMP'S MESSAGE FOR TODAY?\n>> Reporter: GOOD AFTERNOON, MARTHA.\nWE JUST HEARD FROM A CAMPAIGN AIDE THAT DONALD TRUMP WILL HIT\nHILLARY CLINTON RATHER HARD ON HER TIES TO WALL STREET.\nIN THE WORDS OF THIS CAMPAIGN AIDE, FOR BEING A TOOL OF WALL\nSTREET, AND ALSO TALKING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND HIS HISTORY AS\nA BUSINESSMAN, TRYING TO PLAY UP THE FACT THAT HE WOULD BE GOOD\nFOR THE ECONOMY BECAUSE OF HIS EXPERIENCE WORKING AS A\nBUSINESSMAN. THIS AS MUCH OF THE POLLS WE\nHAVE SEEN, THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS AWARE OF THIS, IS REPUBLICANS\nWHO WERE ONCE SKEPTICAL COMING BACK INTO THE FOLD TO SUPPORT\nDONALD TRUMP. WE ARE IN THE WESTERN PART OF\nIOWA. IT IS A HEAVILY REPUBLICAN AREA\nOF IOWA, SO THEY NEED THAT TURNOUT OPERATION HERE TO\nINSPIRE PEOPLE HERE TO SHOW UP TO THE POLLS FOR HIM ON TUESDAY.\nTHE POLLS LOOK PRETTY GOOD FOR HIM IN IOWA.\n\"THE DES MOINES REGISTER\" CAME OUT WITH A POLL YESTERDAY\nSHOWING DONALD TRUMP LEADING BY SEVEN PERCENTAGE POINTS.\nHE HAS, AMONG OTHER THEMES, BEEN HITTING A LOT ON OBAMACARE,\nESPECIALLY WITH THE PREMIUM INCREASES WE'VE SEEN FOR NEXT\nYEARS PLANS IN OBAMACARE. HE HAS ALSO HIT ON WIKILEAKS,\nHILLARY CLINTON, CALLING HER A CRONY.\nAMONG THE OTHER THEMES WE'VE HEARD FROM DONALD TRUMP OF LATE.\nYOU KNOW THAT FORMULA, AS YOU'D MENTIONED, WAS INTERRUPTED JUST\nA LITTLE BIT LAST EVENING WHEN APPARENTLY SOMEONE WAS HOLDING A\nSIGN THAT SAID REPUBLICANS AGAINST TRUMP.\nTHAT'S WHEN THE SECRET SERVICE CAME IN.\nIN A STATEMENT SECRET SERVICE SAID IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF THE\nSTAGE AN UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUAL SHOUTED GUN.\nSECRET SERVICE AGENTS AND RENO POLICE OFFICERS IMMEDIATELY\nAPPREHENDED THE SUBJECT. UPON A THOROUGH SEARCH OF THE\nSUBJECT AND THE SURROUNDING AREA, NO WEAPON WAS FOUND.\nDONALD TRUMP RETURNED TO THE STAGE, FINISHED HIS REMARKS, AND\nNOW HE'S HERE IN SIOUX CITY, IOWA.\n>> AN UNNERVING MOMENT TO BE SURE.\nWE WILL WATCH FOR HIM IN A FEW MOMENTS WHERE YOU ARE.\n>> MARTHA, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE YOU OVER TO THE MAP IN A MOMENT\nHERE AND WE'RE JUST -- THERE WE GO.\nLOVE THIS THING. JUST PULL IT OUT A LITTLE WIDER.\nI'M GO TO THIS MAP AND SHOW YOU WHAT'S HAPPENING.\nA LOT OF FOCUS ON PENNSYLVANIA FOR VERY GOOD REASON.\nREPUBLICANS HAVE WANTED TO WIN THIS STATE GOING BACK TO 1988\nAND THEY HAVE NOT. IS IT IN PLAY THIS YEAR?\nLOOK AT SOME OF THE RESULTS FROM PENNSYLVANIA FROM FOUR YEARS\nAGO. THIS IS OBAMA BEATING ROMNEY.\nNOW, I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU THE MATH.\nTHERE WAS ABOUT 5 MILLION-PLUS VOTES CAST.\nTHE DIFFERENCE IS ABOUT 300,000 WHEN OBAMA WON THE STATE.\n300,000 FOR ALL OF PENNSYLVANIA. BUT HERE IN THE CITY OF\nPHILADELPHIA, YOU HAVE A MARGIN OF 500,000 VOTES IN FAVOR OF\nBARACK OBAMA OVER MITT ROMNEY. IN JUST THAT ONE PART OF THE\nSTATE, SO YOU SEE WHERE HILLARY CLINTON AND TEAM CLINTON GO BACK\nTHERE OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND THAT'S WHERE MIKE EMANUEL IS\nTODAY, LIVE IN PHILLY WHERE CLINTON JUST WRAPPED UP AN\nEVENT. THE CLINTON TEAM FOCUSING A LOT\nON P.A. AND IN MICHIGAN. LET'S START THERE.\n>> Reporter: WELL, BILL, YEAH, DEMOCRATS ARE SAYING ESSENTIALLY\nTHE RACES IN PENNSYLVANIA AND MICHIGAN HAVE GOTTEN VERY CLOSE.\nPART OF WHAT THEY'RE SAYING ABOUT WHY THEY'RE INVESTING SO\nMUCH TIME AND ENERGY IN THOSE TWO STATES IS BECAUSE THEY ARE\nSTATES THAT DON'T DO EARLY VOTING, SO IT'S ALL ABOUT\nTUESDAY, ALL ABOUT ELECTION DAY. HOWEVER, CHRIS WALLACE TODAY\nPUSHED CLINTON'S CHIEF STRATE\nA CRACK IN THE BLUE WALL TODAY ON \"FOX NEWS SUNDAY.\"\n>> OUR JOB IS EVERY STATE WE MAKE HARDER FOR DONALD TRUMP TO\nWIN MAKES HIS PATH NARROWER AND NARROWER.\nWE ALWAYS WANTED TO BE IN A POSITION WHERE WE'RE NOT TRYING\nTO THREAD A NEEDLE, NOT DRAWING TO AN INSIDE STRAIGHT.\n>> Reporter: TO BE CLEAR, THE CLINTON TEAM IS SENDING THE\nPRESIDENT, THE FORMER PRESIDENT, AND THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE BACK\nTO MICHIGAN. THEY'RE ALSO DOING SEVERAL MORE\nEVENTS HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA, SO IT IS VERY FAIR TO SAY THERE IS\nDEMOCRATIC CONCERN, BILL. >> EARLY VOTING IS DOWN AMONG\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS. IS THAT TRUE IN SOME SWING\nSTATES AND IF SO, BY HOW MUCH? WHAT YOU HEARING?\nWHAT ARE YOU SEEING IN THE NUMBERS?\n>> NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. AFRICAN-AMERICAN NUMBERS ARE\nDOWN IN PLACES LIKE NORTH CAROLINA, ALSO IN FLORIDA, AND\nSO THE CLINTON TEAM AND ITS ALLIES ARE DOING EVERYTHING HE\nCAN TO DRIVE AFRICAN-AMERICAN TURNOUT.\nHILLARY CLINTON WENT TO A PREDOMINANTLY AFRICAN M.A.S.H.\nCHURCH IN PHILADELPHIA. SHE WENT WITH CORY BOOKER, THE\nPOPULAR AFRICAN-AMERICAN SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY TRYING TO STIR\nUP SUPPORT. SHE HAS PRESIDENT OBAMA DOING\nEVERYTHING ARE HE CAN TO DRIVE AFRICAN-AMERICAN TURNOUT BUT\nHE'S NOT ON THE BALLOT THIS TIME AND IT'S NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR HE\nCAN SHARE HIS POPULARITY WITH HER.\nTODAY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN SOUNDED A LITTLE\nDEFENSIVE. >> YOU'RE COMPARING US AGAINST\nTHE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT RUNNING FOR\nRE-ELECTION, BUT WE THINK WE CAN HIT THOSE NUMBERS AND THE\nPRESIDENT IS HELPING US DO THAT, AND -- BUT WE'VE BUILT A\nDIFFERENT KIND OF COALITION AND A BIGGER COALITION.\n>> Reporter: THE COUNTER FROM THE CLINTON TEAM IS THAT THEY'RE\nDOING BETTER WITH LATINO VOTERS WHICH COULD BE THE DIFFERENCE IN\nPLACES LIKE NEVADA, PERHAPS FLORIDA, AND SO THEY ARE SAYING\nIT IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF COALITION THIS TIME.\nBILL? >> THANK YOU, MIKE.\nMIKE EMANUEL IN PHILADELPHIA. TALK TO YOU SOON, MIKE.\nTHANKS FOR THAT. >> THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN DEALING\nWITH THE FALLOUT FROM NUMEROUS SCANDALS IN THE FINAL DAYS OF\nTHIS ELECTION. WILL THEY BE HER DOWN FALL?\nTHERE HE IS WITH PHARRELL WILLIAMS.\nSHE'S BEEN WITH A LOT OF CELEBRITIES OVER THE LAST COUPLE\nDAYS. TREY GOWDY, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE\nBENGHAZI COMMITTEE, SAYS VOTERS GET TO DECIDE ON TUESDAY WHETHER\nTHEY'VE HAD ENOUGH. >> IF YOU'RE TIRED OF THE\nPOLITICALIZATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND YOU'RE\nTIRED OF SCANDAL AFTER SCANDAL AFTER STIMULUS PLAN FOR THE\nCRIMINAL DEFENSE BAR OR WHATEVER YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO GET\nFROM HER ADMINISTRATION, OUR FRAMERS WERE SMART ENOUGH TO\nGIVE US AN OPTION. CONGRESS CAN'T FIX IT, BUT THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE CAN ON TUESDAY. >> LET'S BRING IN LANNY DAVIS.\nWELCOME. GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE TODAY.\n48 HOURS TO GO IN THIS -- >> SOMETIMES I THINK I'M ON\n\"SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE\" WHEN I LISTEN TO TREY GOWDY WHO CAME UP\nWITH A BIG ZERO AFTER ALL THAT INVESTIGATION, BUT NICE TO BE\nBACK, MARTHA, AND SAY HELLO TO BILL HEMMER.\n>> THEY DIDN'T HAVE THEIR HANDS ON A LOT OF THE INFORMATION THEY\nWANTED AND SOME OF IT HAS COME OUT IN THE MEANTIME.\n>> LET'S DEBATE THAT AFTER TUESDAY, MARTHA.\n>> ANYWAY, WE'RE NOT HERE TO LITIGATE THAT PRIOR\nCONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION AT THIS POINT.\nWE'RE HERE TO LITIGATE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE COMING 48\nHOURS AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AS HE SAYS, YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH\nTHAT MOTION, THAT THEY WILL HAVE THEIR MOMENT TO SPEAK IN THIS\nELECTION OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.\nSO WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHERE THEY ARE, MINNESOTA IS WHERE DONALD\nTRUMP IS TODAY. HASN'T BEEN A REPUBLICAN ELECTED\nIN MINNESOTA SINCE 1972. YOU HAVE PRESIDENT OBAMA AND\nHILLARY CLINTON IN MICHIGAN TRYING TO HOLD ONTO TERRITORY\nTHERE. WHAT DO YOU THINK?\n>> I THINK THAT WE'RE IN A FANTASTIC POSITION, BUT YOU'RE\nIGNORING THOSE FACTS, AND LET ME GIVE SOME FAIR AND BALANCED\nALTERNATIVE FACTS. OF COURSE WE'RE CONCERNED,\nTHINGS ARE TIGHTENING UP -- >> THEN WE AGREE.\nSO FAR WE AGREE. >> HOLD ON.\nCOME ON, MARTHA, YOU ALWAYS LET ME FINISH.\n>> GO AHEAD. >> LAST NIGHT \"THE WASHINGTON\nPOST\"/ABC NEWS POLL PLUS FIVE. TODAY NBC/\"WALL STREET JOURNAL,\"\nPLUS FOUR. THIS TIME FOUR YEARS AGO BARACK\nOBAMA PLUS ONE. THIS IS A SUBSTANTIAL MARGIN ON\nTHE LAST WEEKEND. I'D RATHER BE HILLARY CLINTON\nTHAN DONALD TRUMP. >> I MEAN, NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THE\nOUTCOME IS GOING TO BE COME TUESDAY --\n>> EXCEPT THOSE FACTS. I AGREE.\n>> WHO KNOWS, RIGHT? >> WE'RE AHEAD.\nWHO KNOWS. >> THE FACTS ARE VERY FLUID AND\nYOU'RE RIGHT, DEFINITELY AHEAD IN THESE NATIONAL POLLS AND\nTIGHT IN A LOT OF BATTLEGROUND STATES.\n>> TIGHT BUT AHEAD IN THE BROUNT  >> NOBODY KNOWS WHAT'S GOING TO\nHAPPEN ON TUESDAY. >> I'D RATHER BE HILLARY CLINTON\nTHAN DONALD TRUMP. >> YOU KNOW WHAT'S SO\nFASCINATING TO ME, JUST GOING THROUGH SOME OF THE STORIES THIS\nMORNING AND LOOKING AT THEM. I WAS LOOKING AT THIS PIECE THAT\nWAS WRITTEN CALLED \"THE DEATH OF ELITISM\" AND IT TALKS ABOUT A\nBIG SIGN ON THE HIGHWAY BETWEEN SHARON, PENNSYLVANIA, AND\nMASONRY, OHIO, ON ROUTE 62. THE SIGN SAYS YOU HAD YOUR\nCHANCE. IT'S OUR TURN NOW.\nAND IT TALKS ABOUT HOW THERE'S A CHANGING FACE IN THIS COUNTRY\nTHAT WE MAY SEE PLAY OUT ON TUESDAY NIGHT, AND IT ASSOCIATES\nHILLARY CLINTON WITH THAT SORT OF, YOU KNOW, YESTERDAY ELITISM,\nTHAT INSIDE BASEBALL, CONNECTED TO CORPORATIONS, CONNECTED TO\nBANKS, CONNECTED TO THINGS PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY ARE\nHAVING DOUBTS ABOUT THESE DAYS. >> LOOK, THAT'S A LEGITIMATE\nGRIEVANCE IN THE COUNTRY. RIGHT NOW IT'S, ACCORDING TO ALL\nTHE POLLS ON THE LAST WEEKEND, IT'S STILL A MINORITY, BUT IT'S\nREAL AND PRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON HAS SAID I WANT TO BE\nPRESIDENT OF ALL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, INCLUDING THE PERSON WHO\nPUTS THAT SIGN UP. LET ME REMIND YOU THOSE SIGNS\nWERE UP IN 2012 AND 2008 AND BARACK OBAMA WAS ELECTED AND\nRE-ELECTED, BUT THOSE ARE GENUINE GRIEVANCES, AND THE\nTRUMP SUPPORTERS SHOULD BE RESPECTED AND PRESIDENT HILLARY\nCLINTON WILL RESPECT THAT POINT OF VIEW AND WILL CONTRAST HER\nPOINT OF VIEW WITH SOMEBODY WHO IS A BILLIONAIRE BUSINESSMAN WHO\nWENT BANKRUPT FOUR TIMES AND HIS CLOSING MESSAGE IS HE'S A\nBUSINESSMAN. THAT'S WHY SHE'S AHEAD.\n>> THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF STORIES, I'M SURE YOU'VE SEEN\nTHEM, OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS TALKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO\nHOPE AND CHANGE. WHAT HAPPENED TO BRINGING THE\nCOUNTRY TOGETHER? AND WE STAND ON THE PRECIPICE OF\nTHIS ELECTION MORE DIVIDED THAN I THINK MOST OF US HAVE EVER\nSEEN THIS COUNTRY IN OUR ADULT LIVES.\nWHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT THE FACT -- YOU SAY THOSE SIGNS WERE\nOUT THERE IN 2012 AND '08. SO WHY WERE THEY NOT HEEDED\nTHEN. WHAT YOU HAVE NOW IS A PART OF\nTHIS COUNTRY, A LARGE PART WHETHER THEY WIN OR LOSE ON\nTUESDAY, WHO FEEL VERY MUCH FORGOTTEN IN THE DEMOCRATIC\nLEADERSHIP. >> AGAIN, MARTHA, I ALWAYS\nRESPECT YOUR POINT OF VIEW AND A FEELING THAT YOU HAVE JUST\nDESCRIBED HAS TO BE RESPECTED, BUT LET ME GIVE YOU FACTS\nBECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I DO. RIGHT NOW BARACK OBAMA HAS THE\nHIGHEST APPROVAL RATING COMPARED TO DISAPPROVAL ACCORDING TO\nGALLUP AND EVERY POLLSTER NEXT TO ONLY ONE OTHER PRESIDENT WHO\nWENT THROUGH THE REPUBLICAN SCANDAL MACHINE AND THAT WAS\nBILL CLINTON. RIGHT NOW BARACK OBAMA HAS A\nHIGHER APPROVAL RATING SO HOPE AND CHANGE HAS A MAJORITY IN\nSUPPORT OF BARACK OBAMA, SO WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING IS STILL A\nMINORITY VIEWPOINT WHICH I DEEPLY RESPECT.\n>> THAT'S MY WHOLE POINT. THAT PERHAPS MINORITY VIEWPOINT\nIS ONE THAT, YOU KNOW, FEELS ANGRY AND OVERLOOKED AND --\n>> AND MUST BE RESPECTED. MUST BE RESPECTED.\n>> IF YOU WANT TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY BIHILLARY\nCLINTON SAYS SHE WANTS TO DO, IT WILL BE FASCINATING HOW SHE WILL\nDO THAT TO THE PEOPLE SHE CALLED THE BASKET OF DOUGH PLORABLES.\n>> IT'S NICE TO END EVERY INTERVIEW WITH YOU BY SAYING I\nAGREE BUT LET'S LOOK AT TUESDAY NIGHT.\nIN TERMS OF BASKETS, I THINK THE REASON SHE'S AHEAD IN THE POLLS,\nSHE'S HAD HER DIFFICULTIES, JAMES COMEY TEN DAYS AGO WROTE A\nLETTER THAT SAID HE KNEW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT\nANYTHING TO DO WITH HILLARY CLINTON AND E-MAILS, AND SHE'S\nDROPPED IN THE POLLS. TUESDAY NIGHT THE AMERICAN\nPEOPLE'S VERDICT WILL BE CHANGE, HILLARY CLINTON FIRST FEMALE\nPRESIDENT, A WORKING CLASS PROGRAM THAT CUTS TAXES ON THE\nWEALTHY VERSUS THE STATUS QUO, TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS.\nDONALD TRUMP WANTS TO CUT HIS OWN TAXES BUT NOT REVEAL HIS OWN\nTAX RETURN -- >> YOU KNOW THEY WOULD TAKE\nDISPUTE WITH WHAT YOU JUST SAID BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING\nON THE OTHER SIDE. WE'LL TALK TO SOMEBODY ON THE\nOTHER SIDE. >> I'M SURE YOU WILL.\n>> WE ALWAYS TALK TO BOTH SIDES. AND THAT'S WHY WE LOVE HAVING\nYOU ON. >> A REMINDER, YOU WILL NOT MISS\nA THING ON FOX. LIVE CONTINUOUS COVERAGE AS\nRESULTS COME IN. WE'RE BREAKING DOWN ALL THE\nRACES WITH ANALYSIS, FAIR AND BALANCED REPORTING ALL DAY ON\nTUESDAY, NOVEMBER THE 8th. AND WE HAVE FANCY NEW DIGS OVER\nTHERE. >> OVER THERE.\n>> THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL TOO. REALLY HOPE YOU SPEND TUESDAY\nWITH US ALL DAY AND MAYBE ALL NIGHT.\nWE SHALL SEE. >> WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.\nWE HAVE A GREAT NEW STUDIO. THE BEST THING ABOUT IT IS IT\nHAS A TON OF INFORMATION IN IT AND IT'S REALLY EASY TO READ AND\nEASY TO SEE. SO WE KNOW YOU'LL GO ALONG WITH\nTHAT RIDE FOR US. WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.\nIN THE MEANTIME, ANY MINUTE NOW DONALD TRUMP WILL TAKE THE STAGE\nIN SIOUX CITY, IOWA, AND HE'S RIGHT ON CUE AS WE CALL FOR HIM\nTO WALK OUT. HE'S DONE WELL IN IOWA.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA, OF COURSE, WON IOWA OVER THE COURSE OF THE PAST\nTWO PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. THIS IS A FLIP STATE THAT DONALD\nTRUMP HOPES TO SEE ACTUALLY COME TO FRUITION COME TUESDAY.\nHE'S WORKED HARD TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.\nTHE BIG QUESTION IS THERE'S NO DOUBT THERE'S A TON OF\nENTHUSIASM FOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, BUT IS IT ENOUGH, AND\nTHEY WILL SEE WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S THE CASE COME TUESDAY.\nWORKING HARD TO MAKE IT HAPPEN RIGHT NOW.\n>> BARN BURNER, THE SCHEDULE HERE IN THE LAST 48 HOURS TOO.\nTEN STOPS IN TWO DAYS.

YES, THE REAL CLEAR POLITICS\nAVERAGE OF POLLS SHOWS DONALD TRUMP HAS A LEAD OF ABOUT THREE\nPOINTS HERE IN THE STATE. \"DES MOINES REGISTER\" POLL HAS\nHIM UP BY TEN POINTS. TENSE MOMENTS IN RENO WHEN THE\nSECRET SERVICE LEAPT ON STAGE TO PROTECT THE CANDIDATE.\nREMEMBER, IT HAPPENED BACK IN MARCH IN DAYTON.\nTHE SITUATION HERE, THEY ACTUALLY WHISKED HIM OFF THE\nSTAGE AFTER SOMEBODY AT THE FRONT OF THE CROWD STARTED\nYELLING GUN, GUN. APPARENTLY THEY SAW A PROTESTER\nREACHING FOR SOMETHING IN HIS WAISTBAND.\nTHEY THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A WEAPON.\nIT TURNS OUT IT WAS ONLY A SIGN THOUGH.\n33-YEAR-OLD AUSTIN CRITES WAS DETAINED BY THE POLICE, LATER\nRELEASED. HE TOLD A LOCAL STATION HE IS A\nREPUBLICAN WHO DOES NOT SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP.\nWAS TRYING TO HOLD UP A SIGNS SAYING REPUBLICANS AGAINST\nTRUMP. TRUMP WAS OFF THE STATEMENT FOR  -- STAGE FOR A FEW MINUTES BUT\nRETURNED SHORTLY THEREAFTER. >> WE WILL NEVER BE STOPPED,\nNEVER, EVER BE STOPPED. I WANT TO THANK THE SKRET\nSERVICE. THESE GUYS ARE FANTASTIC.\n>> Reporter: HE BEGINS HIS DAY IN SIOUX CITY, IOWA.\nIT'S FIRST OF TEN STOPS IN TEN STATES HE WILL DO IN THE NEXT\nTWO DAYS. A LAST-SECOND DRIVE TO TRY TO\nGET AS MANY PEOPLE OUT TO THE POLLS AS POSSIBLE, TRYING TO\nEXPAND THE ELECTORAL MAP AS WELL GOING INTO PLACES LIKE MICHIGAN,\nWISCONSIN, AND MINNESOTA. ALSO IN VIRGINIA.\nBUT REALLY, CHRIS, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MAP, IT COMES DOWN TO SIX\nSTATES. DONALD TRUMP LEADS IN FIVE OF\nTHOSE SIX STATES. IF HE WERE TO WIN THOSE, WIN\nFLORIDA IN WHICH HILLARY CLINTON HAS A SLIGHT LEAD, AND WIN\nMAINE'S SECOND CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, HE WOULD GET TO 270 ON\nTHE NOSE AND WIN. IF HE WERE TO GET ALL THAT AND\nNOT WIN MAINE'S SECOND CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, IT WOULD\nBE A 269 TIE. THIS COULD COME DOWN TO ONE\nCONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT IN MAINE. CHRIS?\n>> JOHN ROBERTS REPORTING FROM IOWA.\nJOHN, THANKS FOR THAT. NOW TO THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN.\nMIKE EMANUEL IS LIVE IN PHILADELPHIA, AND PENNSYLVANIA\nHAS VOTED FOR THE DEMOCRAT, THE DEMOCRAT IN THE LAST SIX\nPRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. BUT THE POLLS ARE TIGHTENING\nTHERE TOO. MIKE?\n>> Reporter: CHRIS, AFTER WEEKS OF TREMENDOUS CONFIDENCE, THE\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN IS REVEALING SOME JITTERS ABOUT SOME\nTYPICALLY BLUE STATES, INCLUDING MICHIGAN.\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS ANNOUNCED HILLARY CLINTON, THE\nFORMER PRESIDENT, BILL CLINTON, AND PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL ALL BE\nMAKING CAMPAIGN STOPS THERE IN MICHIGAN AFTER SEEING THE POLLS\nTHERE TIGHTEN. THE FORMER PRESIDENT WILL DO AN\nEVENT TODAY IN LANSING. TOMORROW PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL\nTRY TO GET OUT THE VOTE IN ANN ARBOR.\nAND THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE WILL BE IN GRAND RAPIDS TOMORROW.\nTHAT AFTER BOTH CLINTONS SPENT TIME CAMPAIGNING IN MICHIGAN\nTHIS PAST WEEK. IT IS WORTH NOTING A REPUBLICAN\nHAS NOT WON THE GREAT LAKE STATE SINCE 1988.\nLAST NIGHT CLINTON HAD ANOTHER BIG NAME ENTERTAINER HELPING HER\nAT A RALLY HERE IN PHILADELPHIA. SINGER KATY PERRY DID A GET OUT\nTHE VOTE CONCERT FOR CLINTON. CLINTON TOLD SUPPORTERS THAT\nALREADY MORE THAN 37.5 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE VOTED AND CALLED ON\nOTHERS TO DO THEIR PART. >> I BELIEVE THEY ARE STANDING\nUP FOR A HOPEFUL, INCLUSIVE VISION OF AMERICA, AND I'M\nASKING YOU TO STAND THAT SAME VISION WHEN YOU COME OUT\nAND VOTE ON NOVEMBER THE 8th. IT'S YOUR TURN, PHILADELPHIA!\n>> Reporter: IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT PENNSYLVANIA IS ANOTHER\nBLUE STATE THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS SPENDING A LOT OF TIME AND\nENERGY HERE AHEAD OF ELECTION DAY.\nSHE'LL RETURN HERE TOMORROW NIGHT FOR A RALLY WITH THE\nPRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY ON ELECTION EVE.\nCHRIS? >> MIKE EMANUEL REPORTING FROM\nPHILADELPHIA. MIKE, THANK YOU.\nJOINING ME NOW FROM ANOTHER BATTLEGROUND STATE, VIRGINIA, IS\nTRUMP'S RUNNING MATE INDIANA GOVERNOR MIKE PENCE.\nGOVERNOR, IT'S ALL ABOUT THE NUMBERS NOW --\n>> MORNING. >> -- AND LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT\nTHEM IN THE LATEST REAL CLEAR POLITICS AVERAGE OF NATIONAL\nPOLLS, TRUMP IS DOWN TWO POINTS TO CLINTON, AND YOU'RE LOSING\nNARROWLY IN SOME KEY SWING STATES, DOWN JUST OVER A POINT\nIN FLORIDA, DOWN 2.5 POINTS IN PENNSYLVANIA, UP LESS THAN A\nPOINT IN NORTH CAROLINA. THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT TRUMP\nAND YOU HAVE TIGHTENED THE RACE, BUT THE FACT IS YOU'RE STILL\nLOSING AND THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU GO OVER THE TOP?\nWHAT DO YOU DO IN TERMS OF SPECIFICALLY, WHO, WHICH STATES,\nWHERE TO GO OVER THE TOP IN THESE FINAL 48 HOURS?\n>> WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, OUR SECRET WEAPON IS THE AMERICAN\nPEOPLE WHO ARE SAYING ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.\nI WAS HERE AT A RALLY LAST NIGHT IN VIRGINIA.\nWE HAD AN OVERFLOW CROWD THAT WAS BIGGER THAN SOME OF THE\nRALLIES THAT I'VE SEEN OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL OVER THE LAST\nSEVERAL MONTHS AS I'VE CAMPAIGNED FOR DONALD TRUMP AND,\nOF COURSE, YOU SEE THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE COMING OUT\nWITH DONALD TRUMP. HE'LL HAVE FIVE RALLIES A DAY\nTODAY AND TOMORROW ACROSS THIS COUNTRY.\nWE'RE TAKING A MESSAGE TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN ALL ACROSS\nTHIS COUNTRY, AND I THINK LITERALLY, LITERALLY BY THE HOUR\nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE RECOGNIZING THAT THIS ELECTION\nIS A CHOICE BETWEEN CHANGE AND THE STATUS QUO.\nIT'S BETWEEN A MORE -- A STRONGER, MORE PROSPEROUS\nAMERICA WITH DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON IS SOMEONE WHO\nWILL CONTINUE THE SAME FAILED POLICIES THAT WEAKENED AMERICA\nAT HOME AND ABROAD. WE JUST FEEL TREMENDOUS --\n>> GOVERNOR, I DO WANT TO GET TO SOME SPECIFICS THOUGH.\nHISPANICS ARE VOTING EARLY IN BIG NUMBERS IN A NUMBER OF\nSTATES, FLORIDA, NORTH CAROLINA, ARIZONA, NEVADA.\nARE YOU WORRIED THAT THE POLARIZING REMARKS THAT YOUR\nRUNNING MATE, DONALD TRUMP, HAS MADE SINCE HIS OPENING\nANNOUNCEMENT MAY COME BACK TO BEAT HIM?\n>> WELL, YOU KNOW, I'M REALLY NOT.\nI MEAN, THE TRUTH IS THAT HISPANIC AMERICANS HAVE THE SAME\nCONCERNS THAT EVERY OTHER AMERICAN DOES.\nWE WANT TO GET THIS ECONOMY MOVING AGAIN.\nWE WANT OUR COUNTRY TO BE SAFE. I WAS JUST DOWN IN MIAMI THIS\nLAST WEEKEND, SO OVERWHELMING SUPPORT FOR DONALD TRUMP'S\nSTRONG STAND FOR FREEDOM IN THIS HEMISPHERE, STANDING STRONGLY\nAGAINST WHAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND HILLARY\nCLINTON WANT TO CONTINUE -- >> SO YOU THINK ALL THOSE\nHISPANICS, SIR, ARE COMING OUT TO VOTE FOR TRUMP AND NOT FOR\nCLINTON? REALLY?\n>> NO, I'M SAYING THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT CHANGE, AND\nTHAT'S AMERICANS COMING FROM EVERY CATEGORY.\nI LITERALLY SAW IT. I STOPPED BY AND HAD SOME CUBAN\nCOFFEE AT A CLASSIC STOP IN MIAMI, AND KAREN AND I HAD A\nHARD TIME GETTING THROUGH THE PLACE WITH PEOPLE WHO WERE\nENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S STAND FOR A STRONGER\nAMERICA AT HOME AND ABROAD, GETTING THIS ECONOMY MOVING\nAGAIN, AND REPEALING OBAMACARE. I TALKED TO LEADERS IN THAT\nCOMMUNITY WHO ARE FEELING THE CRUSHING WEIGHT OF OBAMACARE.\n25% INCREASES IN THE PREMIUMS OF OBAMACARE, CHRIS, IN FLORIDA AND\nALL ACROSS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW WE CAN DO BETTER.\nIT'S GOING TO TAKE CHANGE IN WASHINGTON, D.C., AND I REALLY\nDO BELIEVE THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SEEING PEOPLE FROM ALL ACROSS\nTHE SPECTRUM, REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS, MANY DEMOCRATS,\nAND PEOPLE LITERALLY FROM EVERY COMMUNITY IN THIS COUNTRY\nRALLYING BEHIND DONALD TRUMP MORE AND MORE BY THE HOUR.\n>> TRUMP HAS BEEN ARGUING THAT IF CLINTON WINS, THAT SHE FACES\nA CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION AND AN INDICTMENT, AND HERE HE IS ON\nTHE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. TAKE A LOOK.\n>> IF SHE WERE TO WIN, IT WOULD CREATE AN UNPRECEDENTED\nCONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS. WHAT A MESS.\nI MEAN, WE WENT THROUGH IT WITH HIM WITH THE IMPEACHMENT, THE\nLIES. AREN'T WE TIRED OF THIS STUFF?\n>> BUT, GOVERNOR, TRUMP HAS NO HARD EVIDENCE SHE'S GOING TO\nFACE AN INDICTMENT. THAT'S OVERSTATEMENT.\n>> WELL, HILLARY CLINTON AND HER FOUNDATION ARE UNDER A CURRENT\nINVESTIGATION BY THE FBI. WE JUST FOUND OUT THIS MORNING\nTHAT SHE HAD HER MAID PRINT OFF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION ACCORDING\nTO REVELATIONS IN \"THE NEW YORK POST.\"\nCHRIS, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW.\nWE COMMEND THE FBI FOR FOLLOWING THE FACTS AND REOPENING THE\nINVESTIGATION, BUT I THINK THIS IS PART OF THE WAY THE AMERICAN\nPEOPLE NEED TO COUNT THE COSTS IN THIS ELECTION.\nDO WE WANT MORE OF THE FAST AND LOOSE ETHICS OF THE CLINTONS\nOVER THE LAST 30 YEARS OR DO WE WANT A CLEAN BREAK?\nDO WE WANT TO DRAIN THE SWAMP IN WASHINGTON, D.C., HAVE\nFUNDAMENTAL ETHICS REFORM AND REBUILD OUR MILITARY, REVIVE OUR\nECONOMY, REPEAL OBAMACARE, AND HAVE APPOINTMENTS TO THE SUPREME\nCOURT THAT WILL UPHOLD OUR CONSTITUTION?\nTHIS IS ALL PART OF THE EQUATION I THINK EXPLAINS WHY YOU SEE\nSUCH TREMENDOUS MOMENTUM IN THIS CAMPAIGN AND WHY OUR CAMPAIGN IS\nLITERALLY EXPANDING THE MAP. WE'RE ON OFFENSE, AND THE\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN IS LITERALLY ON DEFENSE TRYING TO SHORE UP BLUE\nSTATES AROUND THE COUNTRY IN THE WANING DAYS OF THE CAMPAIGN.\n>> SPEAKING OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS AND DRAINING THE\nSWAMP, TWO OF GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE'S TOP AIDES WERE\nCONVICTED OF FRAUD AND CONSPIRACY FRIDAY IN THE\nBRIDGEGATE CASE, AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT THERE WAS REPEATED\nTESTIMONY IN THAT TRIAL THAT CHRISTIE KNEW ALL ABOUT THE\nEFFORT TO CLOSE THE LANES TO THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE TO\nPUNISH A POLITICAL OPPONENT, ARE YOU COMFORTABLE WITH CHRISTIE AS\nTHE CHAIRMAN OF THE TRUMP TRANSITION TEAM IF HE'S ELECTED?\n>> WHAT I WOULD TELL YOU IS CHRIS CHRISTIE HAS CONTINUED TO\nSTRONGLY STATE HIS POSITION THAT HE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THOSE\nACTIONS TAKEN, AND, FRANKFRANKL HE SAID LATE IN THE WEEK IS WHAT\nHIS CONVICTIONS PROVE IS HE WAS RIGHT TO IMMEDIATELY FIRE THOSE\nPEOPLE FOR THE ACTIONS THEY HAD TAKEN.\nBUT, LOOK, ALL OF OUR FOCUS IS ON ELECTION DAY, I PROMISE YOU.\nAND WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR CHRIS CHRISTIE'S ROLE IN THE CAMPAIGN\nAND WE'RE GOING TO ALL KEEP OUR HEAD DOWN AND WORK HARD --\n>> NO CHANCE HE'LL BE REPLACED AFTER THE ELECTION?\nI MEAN, YOU'RE STANDING BY CHRIS CHRISTIE DESPITE ALL THIS\nEVIDENCE? >> LOOK, THERE'S NO CHANGES IN\nPERSONNEL HERE IN THE WANING DAYS OF THE CAMPAIGN.\nWE'RE A HUNDRED PERCENT FOCUSED ON BRINGING HOME A GREAT VICTORY\nFOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND REPUBLICANS ARE COMING TOGETHER,\nCHRIS. I WAS YESTERDAY WITH SPEAKER\nPAUL RYAN IN WISCONSIN. A COUPLE DAYS BEFORE I WAS WITH\nTHE GOVERNOR IN ARIZONA. LAST NIGHT HERE IN VIRGINIA WITH\nED GILLESPIE. REPUBLICANS ARE COMING HOME AND\nRECOGNIZING THAT WE NEED TO ELECT DONALD TRUMP AS THE NEXT\nPRESIDENT, RE-ELECT A STRONG REPUBLICAN MAJORITY AND\nREPUBLICANS ARE COMING HOME WITH INDEPENDENTS AND DEMOCRATS AT\nTHEIR SIDE TO MAKE SURE THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS NEVER ELECTED\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THE MOMENTUM IS PALPABLE OUT\nTHERE, AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO JUMPING ON A PLANE HEADED TO\nFLORIDA, NORTH CAROLINA, AND NEW HAMPSHIRE TODAY.\n>> BEFORE YOU DO THAT, GOVERNOR, LET ME ASK YOU ONE FINAL\nQUESTION, IF I MAY. THIS HAS BEEN A DIVISIVE AND\nNEGATIVE CAMPAIGN. YOU TALK ABOUT THE PARTY COMING\nTOGETHER. I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE\nCOUNTRY COMING TOGETHER. >> YEAH.\n>> I THINK YOU'D AGREE ONE OF THE STRENGTHS OF OUR DEMOCRACY\nIS WHEN THE ELECTION IS OVER, NO MATTER HOW UGLY, THE LOSER\nGRACIOUSLY CONCEDES TO THE WINNER AND WE ALL RALLY AROUND\nTHE NEW PRESIDENT, WHOEVER THAT TURNS OUT TO BE.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS SAID DIFFERENT THINGS AT DIFFERENT TIMES, SO I\nWANT YOU TO CLEAR THIS UP FOR US.\nCAN YOU GUARANTEE THAT IF THERE IS A CLEAR WINNER ON ELECTION\nNIGHT AND IF, AND I REPEAT IF, I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO SAY, WELL,\nHE'S GOING TO WIN, BUT IF DONALD TRUMP SHOULD BE THE LOSER, CAN\nYOU GUARANTEE THAT HE WILL CONCEDE TO HILLARY CLINTON AND\nACCEPT THE RESULT OF THE ELECTION AND THE JUDGMENT OF THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE? >> WELL, THANKS FOR ANTICIPATING\nMY ANSWER. DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO WIN\nTHIS ELECTION AND HE'LL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE\nRESULTS. >> I'D LIKE YOU NOT TO DUCK IT.\nSIR, CAN YOU GUARANTEE HE'LL PUT THIS BEHIND US AND ACCEPT THE\nRESULTS? >> THE CAMPAIGN -- YEAH, THE\nCAMPAIGN HAS MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT A CLEAR OUTCOME, OBVIOUSLY\nBOTH SIDES WILL ACCEPT, BUT I THINK BOTH CAMPAIGNS HAVE ALSO\nBEEN VERY CLEAR THAT, YOU KNOW, IN THE EVENT OF DISPUTED\nRESULTS, THEY RESERVE ALL LEGAL RIGHTS AND REMEDIES, BUT THE\nTRUTH IS THAT THIS IS SUCH AN EXCITING TIME IN THE LIFE OF OUR\nCOUNTRY. THE WAY THIS COUNTRY IS GOING TO\nCOME TOGETHER IS WHEN WE DELIVER THE CHANGE THAT THE AMERICAN\nPEOPLE LONG TO SEE, WHEN WE REBUILD OUR MILITARY.\nWE'RE STANDING TALL IN THE WORLD.\nWHEN WE REVIVE OUR ECONOMY. WHEN WE HAVE A SUPREME COURT\nTHAT UPHOLDS OUR LIBERTY AND WE SEE AMERICA GROWING AND\nPROSPERING AGAIN -- >> GOVERNOR --\n>> WHEN WE SEE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AMERICA IS GOING TO BE\nUNITED AND WE'RE GOING TO MOVE OUR NATION FORWARD.\n>> GOVERNOR PENCE, THANK YOU.

REMEMBER, IT HAPPENED BACK IN\nMARCH IN DAYTON. THE SITUATION HERE, THEY\nACTUALLY WHISKED HIM OFF THE STAGE AFTER SOMEBODY AT THE\nFRONT OF THE CROWD STARTED YELLING GUN, GUN.\nAPPARENTLY THEY SAW A PROTESTER REACHING FOR SOMETHING IN HIS\nWAISTBAND. THEY THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN\nA WEAPON. IT TURNS OUT IT WAS ONLY A SIGN\nTHOUGH. 33-YEAR-OLD AUSTIN CRITES WAS\nDETAINED BY THE POLICE, LATER RELEASED.\nHE TOLD A LOCAL STATION HE IS A REPUBLICAN WHO DOES NOT SUPPORT\nDONALD TRUMP.

BUT REALLY, CHRIS, WHEN YOU LOOK\nAT THE MAP, IT COMES DOWN TO SIX STATES.\nDONALD TRUMP LEADS IN FIVE OF THOSE SIX STATES.\nIF HE WERE TO WIN THOSE, WIN FLORIDA IN WHICH HILLARY CLINTON\nHAS A SLIGHT LEAD, AND WIN MAINE'S SECOND CONGRESSIONAL\nDISTRICT, HE WOULD GET TO 270 ON THE NOSE AND WIN.\nIF HE WERE TO GET ALL THAT AND NOT WIN MAINE'S SECOND\nCONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, IT WOULD BE A 269 TIE.\nTHIS COULD COME DOWN TO ONE CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT IN MAINE.\nCHRIS? >> JOHN ROBERTS REPORTING FROM\nIOWA.

GO BACK FOUR YEARS.\nWHAT WAS THE REAL CLEAR POLITICS AVERAGE SHOWING FOUR YEARS AGO?\nAND I'M NOT CRITICIZING THEM. I LIKE THEM A GREAT DEAL.\nBUT THEIR -- THEY ARE AWEEK AHEAD OF THE ELECTION, THEY HAD\nROMNEY UP 1 PERCENTAGE POINT OVER PRESIDENT OBAMA.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA WON BY FOUR PERCENTAGE POINTS.\nSO IN ESSENCE, THEY WERE OFF BY FIVE PERCENTAGE POINTS WHICH WAS\nSIX TO SEVEN MILLION VOTES. THAT IS A LOT OF VOTES.\nBUT THEY WERE -- THEY WERE CLOSER THAN MANY OF THE\nINDIVIDUAL SURVEYS. SO THAT IS WHY I SAY POLLING\nAVERAGES ARE NOT PERFECT. BUT THEY ARE BETTER THAN THE\nALTERNATIVE. BUT IF YOU FORCE ME, AS YOUR\nPRODUCER DID, TO PICK A COUPLE OF POLLS THAT ARE PROBABLY MORE\nREPRESENTATIVE, I WOULD PICK THE NBC \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" POLL\nAS ONE OF THEM. WHY?\nBECAUSE IT IS AN OLD POLL. THEY ARE USED TO DOING THESE\nSURVEYS UNDER DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES.\nAND IT GOES BACK A LONG WAY. THEY HAVE A LOT OF HISTORY.\nTHE OTHER POLL I WOULD RECOMMEND TO PEOPLE IS THE ECONOMIST YOU\nGOV POLL BECAUSE THEY HAVE SHOWN REMARKABLE STABILITY IN THIS\nRACE AND I'VE SAID TIME AND TIME AGAIN THAT THESE SURVEYS THAT\nHOP FROM PLUS 13 FOR ONE CANDIDATE TO PLUS FIVE FOR THE\nOTHER CANDIDATE, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.\nTHE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE KNEW FOR WHOM THEY WERE GOING TO VOTE\nAT THE BEGINNING OF THE GENERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN.\nYOU COULDN'T HAVE A MORE STARK DIFFERENCE THAN TRUMP AND\nCLINTON.

BIG STORY THIS EVENING, ANOTHER\nLETTER BY FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY, AND THAT IS PARTIALLY THE\nSUBJECT OF THIS EVENING'S TALKING POINTS MEMO.\nWRITING ONCE QUESTION TO CONGRESS, MR. COMEY SAYS THE\nBUREAU HAS NOW REVIEWED ALL THE E-MAILS THAT WERE ON HUMA\nABEDIN'S COMPUTER. SHE'S HILLARY CLINTON'S TOP\nASSISTANT, AS YOU KNOW. THE BUREAU FOUND NOTHING THAT\nWOULD CHANGE THE STATED OUTCOME OF THE CASE THAT SECRETARY\nCLINTON SHOULD NOT BE CHARGED WITH NATIONAL SECURITY\nVIOLATIONS. OF COURSE, THAT'S VERY GOOD NEWS\nFOR MRS. CLINTON WHO IS UNDER A SHADOW OF CORRUPTION.\nHOWEVER, YOU EITHER BELIEVE HILLARY CLINTON IS CORRUPT OR\nYOU DON'T. AND ANYTHING SHORT OF AN\nINDICTMENT IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE OPINIONS.\nTHOSE WHO PULL A LEVER FOR SECRETARY CLINTON ON TUESDAY\nSURELY KNOW SHE PLAYS BY HER OWN RULES, NOT THOSE YOU AND I ARE\nFORCED TO ABSORB. IT'S QUITE OBVIOUS THE JUSTICE\nDEPARTMENT UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS LITTLE INTEREST IN HOLDING\nHILLARY CLINTON TO ACCOUNT, AND EVERY THINKING PERSON KNOWS\nTHAT. BUT EVEN THOUGH THE DEMOCRATIC\nMACHINE CAUGHT A BREAK TODAY, THERE'S STILL WIKILEAKS WHICH\nCONTINUES TO TORMENT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN.\nAPPARENTLY DOUG BAND WHO RUNS THE CLINTON FOUNDATION WAS\nCONCERNED THAT CHELSS WAS USING FOUNDATION ASSETS FOR, QUOTE,\nHER WEDDING AND LIFE FR A DECADE, UNQUOED.\nAND STATED THAT IN AN E-MAIL TO JOHN PODESTA, WHICH ALSO\nINCLUDED, QUOTE, I HOPE YOU WILL SPEAK TO HER AND END THIS.\nWE DON'T KNOW WHO \"HER\" IS, HILLARY OR CHELSEA, BUT IT'S\nCLEAR THE MONEY WAS BEING USED FOR A PERSONAL ADVANTAGE FOR ALL\nTHREE CLINTONS. NOW, WHETHER THAT'S IMPORTANT TO\nYOU THE VOTER REMAINS TO BE SEEN.\nBUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO TALKING POINT.\nEVERY TIME THE CLINTON FOUNDATION COMES UP, THE CLINTON\nPEOPLE SAY THIS. >> AS YOU KNOW, THE FOUNDATION\nDOES GREAT WORK AROUND THE WORLD AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF AIDS\nDRUGS HERE IN THE UNITED STATES, THE DISTRIBUTION OF DRUGS TO\nBATTLE OPIOID ADDICTION. >> WELL, THAT'S THE MANTRA THAT\nTHE FOUNDATION DOES A LOT OF GOOD, AND IT DOES, BUT THAT'S\nNOT THE POINT. CHARITY FOUNDATIONS ARE SUPPOSED\nTO BE FOR CHARITY, NOT INDIVIDUAL GAIN.\nSO ONCE AGAIN, ONCE AGAIN, HILLARY CLINTON HAS A DUBIOUS\nSITUATION ON HER RESUME. AND HERE'S ANOTHER ONE.\nON FRIDAY, THE RAPPER JAY-Z APPEARED AT A CLINTON RALLY IN\nCLEVELAND. IT WAS GRIM.\n\u00e2\u0099\u00aa [ BLEEP ] \u00e2\u0099\u00aa LADIES IS PIMPS TOO \u00e2\u0099\u00aa\n\u00e2\u0099\u00aa [ BLEEP ] \u00e2\u0099\u00aa >> THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN\nTRADITIONAL AMERICA AND PROGRESSIVE AMERICA.\nJAY-Z, A FORMER DRUG PUSHER, CELEBRATES AND CASHES IN ON\nDEPRAVITY. AND APPARENTLY HILLARY CLINTON'S\nFINE WITH IT USING THE RAPPER TO STIMULATE VOTES IN THE MINORITY\nCOMMUNITY. DONALD TRUMP QUICKLY HOPPED ON\nIT. >> HE USED EVERY WORD IN THE\nBOOK. I WON'T EVEN USE THE INITIALS\nBECAUSE I'LL GET IN TROUBLE. THEY'LL GET ME IN TROUBLE.\nHE USED LANGUAGE LAST NIGHT THAT WAS SO BAD AND THEN HILLARY\nSAID, I DID NOT LIKE DONALD TRUMP'S LEWD LANGUAGE.\nMY LEWD LANGUAGE. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, I'VE NEVER\nSAID WHAT HE SAID IN MY LIFE. >> SO WITH 48 HOURS LEFT BEFORE\nTHE MEDIA STARTS CALLING STATES, THE CAMPAIGN IS AS INTENSE AS\nEVER. TUESDAY CANNOT COME FAST ENOUGH.\nAND THAT'S THE MEMO. NOW FOR THE TOP STORIES.\nPOLLING OUT TODAY, NBC NEWS HAS CLINTON UP BY 4, INVESTOR'S\nBUSINESS DAILY HAS TRUMP UP BY 1, \"THE L.A. TIMES\" TRACKING\nPOLL TRUMP UP BY 5, ABC NEWS CLINTON UP BY 5.\nFLORIDA CBS NEWS HAS A DEAD HEAT TIE.\nOHIO CBS HAS TRUMP UP BY 1. BUT THE COLUMBUS DISPATCH HAS\nCLINTON UP BY 1. AND IN MICHIGAN A FOX 2 DETROIT\nPOLL HAS CLINTON UP BY 5. NOW HERE IN NEW YORK CITY,\nDIRECTOR OF MONMOUTH POLLING AND DAVID MORRIS.\nWE'LL BEGIN WITH YOU. TRUMP IS SPEAKING AT THIS MOMENT\nIN MICHIGAN, WHICH IS UNUSUAL BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, USUALLY YOU\nSEE THAT STATE -- WE'LL TALK TO SARAH PALIN WHO IS IN MICHIGAN\nIN A MOMENT. BUT TRUMP IS SAYING THAT THE\nSECOND COMEY LETTER IS RIGGED. IF YOU WANT JUSTICE, YOU HAVE TO\nVOTE FOR HIM AND GET HER OUT OF THE PICTURE.\nTHAT'S NOT A BAD RETORT. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S RIGGED\nNORTH. I DOUBT IT.\nBUT TO TURN IT AROUND AND TRY TO USE IT FOR HIM, I THINK THAT'S\nFAIRLY CLEVER. >> HE HAS TO DO THAT, BILL.\nHE'S IN THE BLIND. HE'S BEHIND NATIONALLY.\nHE HAS TO FIND SOME WAY TO MAKE THE UNDECIDEDS, THE FEW THAT ARE\nOUT THERE, COME TO HIS SIDE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?\nIT'S ALREADY BAKED IN. PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT THE\nE-MAILS HAVE ALREADY DECIDED. IT'S NOT GOING TO MAKE A\nDIFFERENCE AT THE END OF THE DAY.\n>> I HATE THE END OF THE DAY PHRASE BECAUSE THERE'S A DAY AND\nA HALF LEFT BEFORE PEOPLE GO TO VOTE.\nJUST TWO POINTS IS REAL CLEAR POLITICS SEPARATING CLINTON.\nTHAT'S WITHIN THE MARGIN OF ERROR.\nYOU'RE A POLLSTER, SO I'M SEEING TRUMP OUTWORK HILLARY CLINTON.\nTRUMP DOES, YOU KNOW, SIX EVENTS TODAY, AND HILLARY DID TWO.\nSO I DON'T THINK IT'S OVER BY ANY MEANS.\n>> AS YOU SAID IN THE MEMO, THE KEY THING HERE IS IF THERE'S AN\nINDICTMENT -- >> THERE'S NOT GOOD TO BE AN\nINDICTMENT. >> RIGHT.\nSO THIS IS ABOUT GETTING PEOPLE OUT TO VOTE.\nTHIS IS WHY DONALD TRUMP IS WORKING HIS BACKSIDE OFF\nGOING -- >> YOU WANT JUSTICE, YOU HAVE TO\nVOTE FOR ME BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET JUSTICE.\n>> GETTING THOSE PEOPLE OUT TO VOTE.\nBECAUSE WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE POLLING NUMBERS RIGHT NOW IS\nTHAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS A SLIGHT LEAD, KIND OF HAS GONE UP\nAND DOWN, BUT A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH ENTHUSIASM AND\nRELATIVE ENTHUSIASM. IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY SAY WHO\nIS GOING TO GET TO THE POLLS. SO IT'S GETTING OUT THERE,\nGETTING TO THE KEY STATES. >> SO YOU THINK TRUMP'S SMART TO\nKILL HIMSELF ON THE ROAD? >> HE'S GOT TO.\nHE'S GOT NO CHOICE. HE HAS GOT TO GO TO SOME OF\nTHESE STATES LIKE WASHINGTON, MICHIGAN, MINNESOTA, BECAUSE\nHE'S GOT TO FLIP ONE OF THOSE STATES BASED ON THE POLLING.\nFLORIDA IS CLOSE, OHIO HE'S GOT A BIT OF A LEAD IN.\nSOMETHING WE'VE SEEN IN THE KEY STATES LIKE FLORIDA AND OHIO,\nNORTH CAROLINA, THE POLLS OVER THE PAST 2 1/2 WEEKS HAVE MOVED\nIN HIS DIRECTION. >> YEAH.\n>> MICHIGAN HASN'T MOVED IN HIS DIRECTION, BUT HE'S GOT TO GET A\nSTATE LIKE THAT. >> IT'S ONLY FIVE.\nHE'S ONLY DOWN BY FIVE. >> ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE A NEW\nPOLL SOON? >> A NATIONAL POLL TOMORROW.\n>> YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS? >> NO, WE HAVEN'T FINISHED\nINTERVIEWING. WE'RE FINISHING JUST TONIGHT.\nWE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS TOMORROW. >> NOW DO YOU CONCUR THAT TRUMP\nCOULD WIN THIS RACE, MR. MORRIS? >> WELL, HE CAN.\nBUT IT'S AN AWFULLY STEEP CLIMB FOR HIM.\nTHERE ARE SEVEN STATES THAT I THINK MATTER IN THIS ELECTION.\nAND TRUMP HAS TO WIB ALL SEVEN OF THEM.\n>> TELL US WHAT THEY ARE. >> FLORIDA.\n>> FLORIDA WE DON'T KNOW. DEAD HEAT.\n>> OHIO I THINK TRUMP WILL WIN, IOWA TRUMP WILL WIN.\nARIZONA TRUMP IS GOING TO WIN. NEW HAMPSHIRE HE CAN WIN, MAYBE\nIT COULD GO EITHER WAY. IT COMES DOWN TO NORTH CAROLINA\nWHERE IT'S TIGHT. HE CAN PULL THAT ONE OFF.\nNERVE DARKS I DON'T SEE HOW HE WINS NEVADA.\n>> REALLY? >> NO NEVADA, NO PRESIDENTIAL\nOFFICE. >> BECAUSE NEVADA, THE LATEST\nPOLLING HAS GONE IN HIS FAVOR AND HE WORKED THE RENO AREA\nHARD. WE'LL HAVE THE GOVERNOR OF NORTH\nCAROLINA ON IN A FEW SEGMENTS FROM NOW BECAUSE I AGREE WITH\nYOU. NORTH CAROLINA AT 8:00 ON\nTUESDAY NIGHT MIGHT BE CALLED. IF IT'S CALLED FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON, EVERYBODY GO TO SLEEP. ALL RIGHT?\nTHAT'S CRAZY. >> I DON'T THINK IT BE CALLED\nTHAT EARLY BUT THERE'S SO MUCH EARLY VOTE COMING INTO NORTH\nCAROLINA, WE MIGHT KNOW SOON. IF IT'S NOT OR IT'S NOT CALLED\nEARLY OR IF HE WINS NORTH CAROLINA OR WINS FLORIDA, WE\nMIGHT BE HANGING ON NEW HAMPSHIRE, WHICH IS THE ONE\nSTATE WHERE WE ACTUALLY HAVE SEEN POLLING THAT HAS BEEN VERY\nVOLATILE JUST IN THE LAST FIVE DAYS ALONE.\n>> BUT KELLY AYOTTE, THE INCUMBENT SENATOR REPUBLICAN HAS\nNOW PULLED AHEAD BY THE WBUR POLL WHICH IS THE POLL UP THERE,\nTHE BOSTON UNIVERSITY PUBLIC BROADCASTING SEGMENT.\nSO LOOK, IT'S HARD. ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.\nBUT WHAT I'M SEEING IS THE MOMENTUM NOW FOR TRUMP HAS\nSLOWED. WOULD YOU SAY THAT IT'S SLOWED?\n>> MAYBE EVEN STOPPED.

LET'S GO BEYOND THAT TO THE\nSO-CALLED PREDICTION MODELS WHICH TAKE STATE AND NATIONAL\nPOLLS AND TAKE IT THROUGH THOUSANDS, IN FACT MILLIONS AND\nMILLIONS OF SIMULATIONS.

THE STATES CARRIED BY JOHN\nCAREY, PLUS COLORADO, VIRGINIA, NEW MEXICO, AND PROBABLY NEVADA,\nAND MAYBE NOT NEW HAMPSHIRE.

WE LOOK BACK TO SAY THE 1972\nELECTION AND POLLS IN THE PAST BEFORE SAY 2000 WHERE A LOT LESS\nACCURATE. THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS GOING\nON. THE OTHER THING THAT'S GOING ON\nIS OUR MODEL IS MUCH QUICKER TO ADJUST TO NEW POLLS.\nWE DON'T TAKE THAT LONG OF A SPAN.\nAND THE NEWER POLLS, DESPITE THE TWO YOU MENTIONED, IF YOU LOOK\nAT THE STATES AS WELL, THOSE HAVE TENDED TO SHOW A TIGHTER\nRACE IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS THAN SAY TWO WEEKS BEFORE THAT AFTER\nTHE FIRST DEBATE WHEN HILLARY CLINTON JUMPED OUT TO A HUGE\nLEAD. BUT WHAT I SHOULD POINT OUT IS\nWHETHER YOU LOOK AT THE UPSHOT MODEL OR OUR MODEL, ALL OF THE\nMODELS HAVE HILLARY CLINTON AHEAD.\nIT'S JUST BY VARYING DEGREES. >> RIGHT, BUT THE PROBABILITIES\nMATTER. WHEN YOU SAY THAT ESSENTIALLY\nHILLARY HAS A 2 IN 3 CHANCE OF WINNING, IT MEANIF YOU FLIP\nTHE COIN, YOU KNOW, TWO OF THEM WILL COME HEADS, ONE COULD COME\nTAILS. IT'S NOT UNLIKELY.\nTHERE ARE MANY SPORTS TEAMS, FOR EXAMPLE, WHERE YOU SAY THEY HAVE\nA 1 IN 3 CHANCE OF WINNING AND THEY DO WIN.\n>> SURE, BUT I SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT, YOU KNOW, IF YOU LOOK AT,\nSAY, THE UPSHOT MODEL, 86% OF THE TIME ISN'T 100% OF THE TIME\nEITHER. WHAT I WILL SAY IS IF YOU GO\nBACK TO THE 2000 CAMPAIGN, RIGHT, LOOK AT THE FINAL\nNATIONAL POLLS BETWEEN GEORGE W. BUSH AND AL GORE, BUSH HELD A\nTHREE-POINT LEAD. VERY SIMILAR TO THE LEAD THAT\nHILLARY CLINTON HOLDS RIGHT NOW, AND IT ACTUALLY ENDED UP THAT AL\nGORE WAS THE ONE WHO WON THE POPULAR VOTE.\nTHIS RACE IS NOT OVER, BUT IT IS ONE IN WHICH HILLARY CLINTON HAS\nAN EDGE. >> IF I COULD ADD A SPORTS\nANALOGY. I THINK THAT'S A REALLY GOOD WAY\nTO THINK ABOUT IT IN A WAY. NOT IN SO FAR AS ELECTIONS ARE\nCOMPARABLE TO SPORTS, BUT THEY'RE THINGS PEOPLE HAVE SEEN\nBEFORE. CLINTON IN OUR VIEW WOULD\nPROBABLY HIT THAT FIELD GOAL, BUT ANY PERSON WHO WATCHES THE\nNFL KNOWS THAT KICKERS MISS 38-YARD FIELD GOALS.\nIT HAPPENS. WE HAVE ALL SEEN IT.\nTHERE WAS A GAME ON SUNDAY NIGHT INVOLVING MY SEATTLE SEAHAWKS\nTWO WEEKS AGO IN WHICH THERE WERE TWO KICKS MISSED FROM EVEN\nCLOSER IN OVERTIME.

SAM SAYS THAT MOST IMPORTANT\nTHING YOU SHOULD LOOK AT, FIRST OF ALL, HE THINKS THIS MODEL\nMAKES NO SENSE. THE POLLS SHOULD REFLECT ALL THE\nFUNDAMENTALS.

THAT THAT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE\nTHE CASE. >> BUT IT ALSO DOESN'T CHANGE\nANYTHING. FIRST OF ALL, THIS INVESTIGATION\nWAS MISHANDLED FROM THE BEGINNING.\nWE FOUND OUT TODAY THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAD HER MAID PRINTING\nOUT CLASSIFIED INFORMATION FROM THE COMPUTER AT HOME.\n>> WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT IF IT WAS CLASSIFIED INFORMATION, BUT\nYOU'RE RIGHT, THINGS WERE BEING PRINTED OUT, A WOMAN WHO HAD NO\nSECURITY CLEARANCE. >> NO SECURITY CLEARANCE AND\nIT'S NOT FAIR TO PUT HER IN THAT POSITION BY THE WAY.\nSO I'M NOT CRITICAL OF HER. SHE'S AN INNOCENT BYSTANDER.\nBUT JUST GOES TO THE PATTERN OF HILLARY CLINTON.\nSEPARATE SET OF RULES FOR HER, SEPARATE SET OF RULES FOR US THE\nLITTLE PEOPLE.

YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU'RE\nGETTING. AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE OTHER\nTHAT WE DO KNOW, I STILL THANK IS WHY SHE P HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO\nCLOSE THE DEAL. IF DONALD TRUMP IS SAYING DRAIN\nTHE SWAMP, IF THREE QUARTERS OF AMERICANS ARE SAYING I WANT\nCHANGE, THE CHOICE IS CLEAR.

WE'RE TRAILING BY 130,000 LESS\nTHAN WE DID GOING INTO THE FINAL SUNDAY IN 2012.\nSO WE KNOW THAT THE PERFORMANCE ON ELECTION DAY IS MOST\nIMPORTANT IN PLACES LIKE NEVADA AND FLORIDA AND --\n>> BUT HALF THE VOTE IN FLORIDA IS ALREADY ACCOUNTED FOR BY\nEARLY VOTING.

SO I THINK YOU COULD ARGUE THAT,\nTHIS HAS BEEN THE CENTERPIECE OF DISCUSSION FOR OVER TEN DAYS NOW\nIN THE FINAL STRETCH OF THE CAMPAIGN.\nSO I CERTAINLY THINK IT IS ALREADY HAD AN IMPACT IN SOME\nWAYS IN THE POLLS. ON THE OTHER HAND, IT CERTAINLY\nIS WELCOME NEWS FOR THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN AND KIND OF RECONFIRMS\nTHE ARGUMENT THEY WERE TRYING TO MAKE ORIGINALLY.\nBUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATEMENT THAT PAUL RYAN RELEASED TONIGHT,\nI THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT REPUBLICANS CAN SEIZE ON IN THE\nFINAL COUPLE OF DAYS HERE, WHICH IS TO SAY THAT EVEN THOUGH COMEY\nDID NOT RECOMMEND CRIMINAL CHARGES, HE STILL DESCRIBED HER\nHANDLING OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION AS CARELESS AND\nRECKLESS AND SO FORTH. >> HERE IS THE SPECIFIC LETTER.\nREGARDLESS OF THIS DECISION, THE UNDISPUTED FINDING OF THE FBI\nINVESTIGATION IS THAT SECRETARY CLINTON PUT THE NATION'S SECRET\nAT RISK AND IN DOING SO COMPROMISED OUR NATIONAL\nSECURITY AND SHE BELIEVES SHE IS ABOVE THE LAW AND ALWAYS PLAYS\nBY HER OWN RULES. THAT IS A PATTERN WITH THE\nCLINTONS. PAUL RYAN WRITES THAT THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE SHOULD NOT HAVE ENDURE FOUR MORE YEARS OF THE\nSCANDAL AND BAGGAGE. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE THE\nOPPORTUNITY TO EP SURE SECRETARY CLINTON NEVER GETS HER HANDS ON\nCLASSIFIED INFORMATION AGAIN. LET'S BRING THE CLINTON ERA TO\nAN END BY VOTING FOR DONALD TRUMP ON TUESDAY.\nBY THE WAY, THAT IS PAUL RYAN SAYING VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP ON\nTUESDAY. >> RIGHT.\nWHICH IS REMARKABLE. BECAUSE JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO.\n>> WAS SAYING THAT HE WOULD FOCUS ON HOUSE CANDIDATES,\nALTHOUGH HE NEVER RESCINDED HIS ENDORSEMENT OF TRUMP.\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS SEIZED ON THIS ALL WEEK AND IT IS KEY TO\nTHEIR CAMPAIGN AND FIT THE NARRATIVE THEY WERE TRYING TO\nPUT FORWARD THAT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS INVOLVED IN ALL\nSORTS OF SCANDALS AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE ONCE SHE IS\nELECTED. AND SO THAT RUNS THAT ARGUMENT A\nLITTLE BIT AND I'M WONDERING WHAT THE EFFECT WILL BE DOWN\nBALLOT FOR REPUBLICANS WHO WERE KIND OF RUNNING ON THIS ISSUE.\nI STILL THINK THEY COULD CAPITALIZE ON THE FACT THAT SHE\nWAS UNDER INVESTIGATION IN THE FIRST PLACE.\nBUT WHETHER THIS BLUNTS ANY OF THEIR MOMENTUM, TOO, WE'LL WAIT\nTO SEE. >> CHARLIE?\n>> I DON'T THINK IT IS GOING TO STOP ANY OF DONALD TRUMP OR ANY\nOF THE REPUBLICANS FROM HAMMERING AWAY AT HER ON THIS.\nIT IS A FRUITFUL ISSUE AND THIS LETTER COMES OUT ON THE DAY THAT\nTHE NEW YORK POST REPORTS THAT HILLARY CLINTON AT HER HOME IN\nWASHINGTON, D.C. HAD HER MAID ACTUALLY PRINTING OUT CLASSIFIED\nDOCUMENTS IN A SECURE ROOM IN HER HOUSE.\nSO THE ISSUE IS, IT WILL REMAIN A VERY FRUITFUL ISSUE FOR THEM.\nTHE QUESTION I HAVE ABOUT IT IS, FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE SORT OF\nUNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE FBI DIRECTOR GETTING INVOLVED IN ANY\nOF THIS AT ANY STAGE OF IT, PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE THE\nJUSTICE DEPARTMENT OR THE FBI, SPECIFICALLY, JIMMYING WITH\nPOLITICAL CANDIDATES THIS CLOSE TO AN ELECTION, THEY'VE REALLY\nMADE A MESS OF THIS. THEY HAVE NOT DONE ANYTHING.\nIF HE WAS TRYING TO SORT OF SEND A MESSAGE THAT THE FBI IS NOT\nINVOLVED -- IS INDEPENDENT OF THIS -- OF THE ELECTION, HE'S\nDONE THE EXACT OPPOSITE. >> WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE WHERE\nTHE CANDIDATES ARE TRAVELING.

AND THE WAY IT'S DESCRIBED IN\nTHE WIKILEAKS E-MAIL, IT WAS DONE ROUTINELY.\nROUTINELY. SO IF SHE WAS COMPLETELY\nRECKLESS BACK IN JULY, THIS ADDITION OF HER MAID HANDLING\nCLASSIFIED, TOP-SECRET MATERIAL ROUTINELY MAKES HER BEYOND\nRECKLESSLY CARELESS. IT PUTS HER IN THE CATEGORY OF\nINTENTIONAL CRIME. ALSO TODAY, TWO OTHER MAJOR\nREVELATIONS TOOK PLACE THAT HAVE BEEN BURIED.\nAPPARENTLY ACCORDING TO DOUG BAND, MONEY WAS USED FROM THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION TO PAY FOR THE CHELSEA CLINTON WEDDING AND\nTO PAY FOR A DECADE OF LIFE FOR THEM.\nAND THEN THERE WAS A CAUTIONARY E-MAIL SENT SAYING THAT CHELSEA\nBETTER STOP TALKING ABOUT THIS. AND BEYOND THAT, THERE'S ANOTHER\nE-MAIL THAT POINTS OUT THAT CHELSEA'S HUSBAND, WITH\nCHELSEA'S HELP, WAS GOING TO FOUNDATION DONORS AND RAISING\nMONEY FOR HIS HEDGE FUND.

I NEVER HAD EVIDENCE LIKE THIS.\nI WOULD HAVE WON THE CASES, YOU KNOW, IN TWO WEEKS INSTEAD OF\nSIX IF I HAD EVIDENCE LIKE THIS. >> SO WE HAVE A TWO-TIERED\nJUSTICE SYSTEM. IS THE FBI SAYING IT'S OKAY NOW\nTO USE BLEACHBIT TO DELETE SUBPOENAED E-MAILS?\nWHAT IF I DO THAT? >> OR TO ALLOW MAIDS TO SEND OUT\nCLASSIFIED INFORMATION WHO DO NOT HAVE TOP SECURITY\nCLEARANCES.

SO SHE DID CORRUPT OUR E-MAIL.\nSHE PUT IT ON A SERVER THAT WASN'T SECURE, IN THE CLOSET OF\nA BATHROOM OF A MOM AND POP SHOP.\nIT WAS HACKED INTO. FIVE FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE\nAGENCIES GET IT. WHY DOESN'T HE SAY ANYTHING\nABOUT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION? WHY WON'T HE ACKNOWLEDGE AN\nINVESTIGATION IS ONGOING? >> AND DID THEY INTERVIEW MARINA\nDE LOS SANTOS, THE MAID? AS FAR AS I CAN TELL, THEY NEVER\nINTERVIEWED HER. THAT WOULD BE INCOMPETENCE.\nTHAT WOULD BE BREACH OF ANY KIND OF PROTOCOL YOU WOULD HAVE IN\nTHE FBI. ACCORDING TO THESE E-MAILS, SHE\nROUTINELY WAS USING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION AND SENDING IT ALONG\nTO HILLARY CLINTON. THAT IS A DIRECT VIOLATION OF AT\nLEAST FOUR FEDERAL STATUTES THAT YOU AND I STARTED TALKING ABOUT\nA YEAR AGO. I NEVER KNEW THE EVIDENCE WAS AS\nSTRONG AS THIS.

THAT'S WHY THEY'R PLAYING DOWN\nEVEN THIS GOOD NEWS FOR THEM. OR THEY WOULD SAY AFFIRMATION OF\nWHAT THEY ALREADY BELIEVE. ALSO BAD FOR YOUR CAMPAIGN.\nAND HERE'S WHY. IN THE LAST NINE DAYS, DONALD\nTRUMP SPECIFICALLY HAS BEEN LEADING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO\nBELIEVE THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS GETTING INDICTED, THAT COMEY\nSAYING THIS NINE DAYS AGO IS THE PROOF.\nIT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. SHE'S A CRIMINAL.\nCOMEY IS A GOOD MAN. HE DID THE RIGHT THING.\nNOW, HE'S SAYING IT'S RIGGED. COMEY IS A BAD MAN AND SHE'S\nSTILL A CRIMINAL. DOES DONALD TRUMP ACCEPT THAT\nTHE FBI HAS FOUND NO CRIME? >> WELL, CHRIS, IF YOU LOOK BACK\nAT WHAT MR. TRUMP SAID IN JULY WHEN THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE.\nHE SAID THE FBI CAME TO THE WRONG CONCLUSION.\nIT DOESN'T PASS THE SMELL TEST THAT ALL THESE THINGS COULD\nHAPPEN. WE COULD HAVE FIVE DIFFERENT\nPEOPLE TAKING THE FIFTH INTO THIS INVESTIGATION.\nTHIS ILLEGAL OUTSIDE SERVER WHERE WE FOUND THE TOP\nPSYCHPSSECRET INFORMATION WAS THROUGH AND NOT\nCOME TO SOME KIND OF CHARGES BEING RECOMMENDED MR. TRUMP SAID\nCLEARLY SOMETHING SHOULD HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDED AT THAT POINT\nWHEN MR. COMEY CAME BACK AND REOPENED THE QUESTION ABOUT\n650,000 E-MAILS THAT WERE ON ANTHONY WEINER'S LAPTOP.\nIF YOU HAD SENSITIVE INFORMATION ON A LAPTOP OUTSIDE OF THE SCOPE\nOF WORK, THEY WOULD RUN YOU OUT OF WORK SO QUICK AND BE\nPROSECUTED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW.\nMR. TRUMP SAID THEY SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN IT BACK IN JULY.\n>> LOOK, I GET THE MESSAGE, I GET THE SPIN.\nYOU DO IT WELL. BUT YOU'RE NOT RUNNING FOR\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND HE IS AND USUALLY A HIGHER\nLEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THESE E-MAILS\nWERE. A LOT OF DUPES AND WE DO KNOW\nTHAT THEY WERE ABLE TO GO THROUGH IT.\nYOUR CANDIDATE IS SAYING THEY COULDN'T DO IT.\nHE'S CALLING COMEY A LIAR. THAT'S WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS\nDOING. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THOSE\nE-MAILS. YOU CAN'T KNOW.\nDONALD TRUMP CAN'T KNOW. YOU CAN'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT\nTHE FBI KNOWS HOW TO GO THROUGH THESE THINGS.\nYOU'RE NOT AN EXPERT AND NEATHSER TRUMP.\nBUT HE'S LYING ABOUT THE PROCESS TO UNDERMINE CONFIDENCE WITH THE\nAMERICAN VOTER AND YOU ACCEPT IT.\n>> NO, LET ME TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT MR. TRUMP HAS SAID.\nIT DOESN'T PASS THE SMELL TEST. THEY SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN THIS\nTHING RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING. >> THAT'S HIS RIGHT TO FEEL THAT\nWAY. >> HE'S BEEN VERY CONSISTENT ALL\nALONG AND A TERRIBLE JOB -- >> HE SAYS YOU CAN'T GO THROUGH\n650,000 E-MAILS IN EIGHT DAYS. YOU CAN'T DO IT, FOLKS.\nHE'S CALLING THEM OUT. >> LOOK HOW LONG IT TOOK THEM TO\nGO THROUGH THE 50,000 E-MAILS PREVIOUSLY AND WHAT ABOUT ALL\nTHE DELETED E-MAILS FROM HILLARY CLINTON.\n>> I'LL GIVE YOU YOUR SAY BUT YOU CAN'T SAY THE 55,000 THING\nAND THAT MEANS 650,000 SHOULD TAKE THAT MUCH TIMES MORE.\nRIGHT. BECAUSE IT'S A BIGGER NUMBER.\nNOT TRUE. THEY WERE LOOKING FOR DIFFERENT\nTHINGS IN THE 55,000. THEY WERE DEVELOPING THE\nSOFTWARE DURING THE FIRST PART OF THE INVESTIGATION.\n>> CHRIS, COME ON. THIS ISN'T A VICTORY LAB FOR FBI\nSOFTWARE. >> YOU SAID THEY CAN'T DO IT.\nIT TOOK THEM SIX MONTHS TO DO 50,000 AND THEREFORE IT SHOULD\nTAKE FIVE OR SIX TIMES TO DO 650,000.\nTHAT'S NOT TRUE. THEY WERE ABLE TO DO IT\nRELATIVELY EASY BECAUSE OF THE SOFTWARE AND THE TEAMS INVOLVED.\n>> CHRIS, YOU HAD A FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE, A FORMER\nU.S. SENATOR, A FORMER FIRST LADY UNDER CRIMINAL\nINVESTIGATION. >> NOT GOOD.\n>> FOR SETTING UP AN OUTSIDE SERVER WITH CONFIDENTIAL AND\nCLASSIFIED INFORMATION. THEY FIND 650,000 E-MAILS ON\nTHIS LAPTOP OF ANTHONY WEINER. FIRST OF ALL, I CAN'T IMAGINE\nTHE PERSON WHO HAD TO GO THROUGH ALL THAT AND IT'S A SUBORDINANT\nWHO HAD SENSITIVE INFORMATION AND WE KNOW THAT SECRETARY\nCLINTON WAS EXTREMELY CARELESS AND RECKLESS GOING BACK TO\nDIRECTOR COMEY'S DESCRIPTION BACK IN JULY.\nHERE'S THE THING THAT YOU DIDN'T MENTION.\nTHE CLINTON FOUNDATION IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION.\n>> TALKING ABOUT THE E-MAILS. OBVIOUSLY, THEY'RE UNDER\nINVESTIGATION. THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT CRIMINAL\nPROBES GOING ON. COMEY IS TALKING ABOUT THIS ONE\nAND HE SAYS ALL OF THE E-MAILS THAT THEY FOUND ON WEINER'S\nLAPTOP AND HUMA ABEDIN IS GOING TO HAVE TO EXPLAIN HOW THEY GOT\nON THE LAPTOP. IT'S STILL GOING ON.\nTHAT THEY HAD SEEN THEM, THEY HAD SEEN THEM BEFORE.\nTHEY HAD SEEN THEM BEFORE AND ALL IS NO NEW INFORMATION.\nYOU DON'T ACCEPT IT. YOU'RE SHAKING YOUR HEAD NO.\n>> DON'T ACCEPT IT. RELEASE ALL THE E-MAILS AND LET\nUS HAVE A LOOK BEFORE ELECTION DAY.\n>> YOU LOVE TRANSPARENCY WHEN IT'S NOT YOU GUYS.\nYOU DON'T SEE ANY IRONY IN THAT. WHY DON'T YOU RELEASE TRUMP'S\nTAX PHYSICAL TRANSPARENCY -- >> AS SOON AS HIS AUDIT IS\nCOMPLETED. >> DO YOU THINK ANYBODY BELIEVES\nTHE AUDIT THING? >> ABSOLUTELY.\n>> DO YOU HAVE ANY PROOF OF AN AUDIT?\n>> YES, OF COURSE. >> HAVE YOU SEEN AN AUDIT\nLETTER? >> CHRIS, LET'S NOT GET AWAY\nFROM THE FACT -- >> THAT IS THE FACT.\nTRANSPARENCY ONLY WORKS ONE WAY IN THIS ELECTION.\n>> CHRIS, I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT --\n>> I'M JUST SAYING WHAT IT IS. I'LL SHOW YOU AN AUDIT LETTER I\nGOT. >> WELL, SOME DAY WHEN I GET TO\nMAKE AS MUCH MONEY AS YOU DO. >> I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE\nMAKING. I HOPE YOU GET PAID A LOT FOR\nTHIS. >> THE FOUNDATION IS STILL UNDER\nCRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. >> THAT'S BAD.\n>> BUT WHY LIE ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH AN INVESTIGATION?\nWHY UNDERMINE THE FBI? THEY SAY --\n>> THE CLOUD IS HANGING OVER THE CLINTONS.\n>> NO QUESTION. THAT'S WHY SHE DOESN'T WANT TO\nTALK ABOUT IT. >> THIS IS THE WORST GOOD NEWS.\n>> YOU CAN ARGUE IT'S NOT GOOD NEWS AT ALL BECAUSE THIS HAS\nBEEN BAD FOR HER.

ANNOUNCED TWO FRIDAYS AGO\nDEMOCRATS DIDN'T LIKE IT. NOW DEMOCRATS ARE ELATED,\nPOPPING THE CHAMPAGNE BOTTLES. THEY ARE THRILLED WITH THIS\nEXONERATION OF THEIR CANDIDATE. WHAT'S YOUR REACTION?\n>> WHY IN THE WORLD DID THEY GO SO VICIOUSLY PERSONALLY AND\nPROFESSIONALLY AFTER JIM COMEY AND HIS REPUTATION AND HIS JOB\nPERFORMANCE WHEN THIS WAS ALL ANNOUNCED?\nTHEY BASICALLY SPENT ALL LAST WEEK FOR NINE STRAIGHT DAYS\nIMPUGNING THE INTEGRITY OF JIM COMEY BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T LIKE\nHIS LAST MOVE.

I THINK THEY WERE WAY OUT OF\nBOUNDS IN THE VICIOUS ATTACK ON JIM COMEY BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T\nLIKE THE RESULT. WE THINK THE FBI INVESTIGATION\nWAS MISHANDLED FROM THE BEGINNING.\nTHAT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS. BECAUSE WE JUST LEARNED\nOVERNIGHT SHE ASKED HER MAID TO PRINT OUT INFORMATION THAT WAS\nCLASSIFIED. THIS WOMAN DOES NOT HAVE A\nSECURITY CLEARANCE. IT'S NOT HER FAULT.\nTHE WOMAN WAS PUT IN A BAD POSITION.\nHILLARY CLINTON SHOULD KNOW BETTER.\nWE KNOW SHE LEFT MATERIALS OUT IN CHINA.\nWE KNOW MATERIAL IN THE FRONT SEAT OF THE CAR.\nTHE LIST GOES ON AND ON. I DON'T THINK IT CHANGES WHAT\nMOST PEOPLE THINK ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHOSE WHO WERE DEFENDING HER AGREED WITH HER THEY HAD MADE UP\nTHEIR MIND ABOUT THE E-MAILS BUT IT ALSO DOESN'T CHANGE THE MIND\nOF SWING VOTERS AND INDEPENDENTS WHO JUST AREN'T THERE, WON'T PUT\nHER AT 50% IN BLUE STATES WHERE WE HAVE THEM ON THE RUN.\nTHEY ARE FOLLOWING OUR LEAD BECAUSE OF WHAT COMEY SAID.\nTHEY ARE IN MICHIGAN BECAUSE WE'RE IN MICHIGAN.\n>> HERE IS DONALD TRUMP. THE FBI WOULD NEVER HAVE\nREOPENED THE CASE AT THIS TIME UNLESS IT WAS AN EGREGIOUS\nCRIMINAL OFFENSE, THE BIGGEST SCANDAL SINCE WATERGATE.\nDOES THAT STILL HOLE, THE WORDS HE SAID.\nBIGGEST SCANDAL SINCE WATERGATE, EGREGIOUS OFFENSE.\nTHEY JUST DECIDED TO LOOK AT THE E-MAILS, WASN'T AN EGREGIOUS\nOFFENSE, JUST LOOKED AT THE E-MAILS.\nYOUR CANDIDATE SAID EGREGIOUS OFFENSE WORSE THAN WATERGATE\nBASED ON THE FACT FBI DECIDED TO LOOK AT THESE E-MAILS.\nIS HE STILL SAYING THAT? >> HE ISN'T SAYING THAT IN A\nWHILE. >> APRIL WHILE.\n>> MANY PEOPLE SAID THAT, CHRIS. >> HE SAID IT.\n>> LEFT, RIGHT, AND CENTER SAID THERE MUST BE SOMETHING BIG\nTHERE FOR HIM TO REOPEN IT OR CONTINUE IT, HOWEVER THE\nVERBIAGE IS, THIS CLOSE TO ELECTION.\nNOW, I WANT TO COMMEND THE FBI'S EFFICIENCY.\n>> WHAT ABOUT NOW THAT THEY HAVE SAID THEY EXONERATED HILLARY\nCLINTON SAYING THERE'S NOTHING IN E-MAILS TO JUSTIFY ANY KIND\nOF PROSECUTION, WHERE IS YOUR CANDIDATE WITHOUT HIS BASIS?\nHE HAD A BASIS FOR CHARGING THE WORST CRIME SINCE WATERGATE.\nWHAT'S HIS BASIS FOR NOW SAYING THAT.\n>> HE DIDN'T SAY THAT. >> THIS IS THE BIGGEST SCANDAL\nSINCE WATERGATE. >> HE DIDN'T AT THE TIME.\n>> THAT DOESN'T HOLD. >> CHRIS, IF YOU WANT ME TO\nANSWER, LET ME KNOW. THIS DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING.\nHERE IS THE ANSWER. >> DOES HE STILL BELIEVE SHE'S\nCOMMITTED A CRIME WORSE THAN WATERGATE?\n>> HE SAID THAT ONE TIME. THE FACT REMAINS THAT WHAT SHE\nDID OFF-WHAT JIM COMEY SAID SHE DID IN THE COMMITTEE BEFORE\nCHAIRMAN GOWDY HAS NOT CHANGE. I TOTALLY AGREE WITH JIM COMEY\nNOTHING CHANGES FROM THE ORIGINAL CONCLUSION.\nLET'S REVIEW. SHE LIED ABOUT THE PRIVATE\nSERVER TO BEGIN W SHE LIED ABOUT WHAT'S ON THE SERVER.\nSHE LIED ABOUT CLASSIFIED INFORMATION ON E-MAILS.\nIT WAS. SHE ALSO TESTIFIED ABOUT USING\nONE DEVICE, SHE HAD USED MULTIPLE DEVICES.\nWE BELIEVE EVERYTHING HE SAID UNDER OATH JULY 7th, WHICH WAS A\nPRETTY REMARKABLE SPECTACLE IN AND OF IT'S SELF IS STILL THE\nTRUE. THAT'S WHY THE MAJORITY OF\nAMERICANS INCLUDING YOUR MSNBC POLLING DON'T TRUST HER.\nTHEY DON'T THINK SHE'S TRUSTWORTHY.\nIT DIDN'T CHANGE LAST WEEK AND WON'T CLANG TONIGHT.\n>> IS MR. TRUMP GOING TO WANT TO HAVE CONTINUANCE OF E-MAILS.\n>> I DON'T KNOW. WE'LL HAVE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS.\nTHE FACT IS FOR A CAMPAIGN AND FOR CONSERVATIVES WHO GENERALLY\nARE CRITICAL OF INEFFICIENCY OF GOVERNMENT AND HOW SLOWLY IT\nMOVES, I HAVE TO REALLY COMMEND THE EFFICIENCY OF THE FBI IN\nTHIS CASE BECAUSE THEY READ 650,000 E-MAILS IN A SHORT\nPERIOD OF TIME THAT'S REMARKABLE.\n>> HE SAID INVESTIGATIONS CONTINUE ADD INFINITE UM, SCREW\nUP ANY HILLARY ADMINISTRATION. IF YOU'RE A HILLARY PERSON, WHY\nBOTHER ELECTING HER, NOTHING BUT CHAOS AND INVESTIGATIONS THE\nWHOLE TERM. DOES HE STILL BELIEVE THAT WOULD\nBE THE CASE IF SHE WINS. >> WHAT SHOULD HE HAVE SAID?\nHE'S NOT THE FBI, NOT DIRECTOR COMEY.\nDIRECTOR COMEY MADE THAT DECISION AND MR. TRUMP GAVE HIS\nOPINION OF IT. IT'S A VERY LOGICAL OPINION TO\nHAVE, CONCLUSION TO MAKE. IT DOES HURT HER.\nSHE'S HILLARY CLINTON. CHRIS, THE IDEA PEOPLE STARTED\nTO QUESTION HILLARY CLINTON'S ETHICAL STANDARDS OR CLOUD OF\nCORRUPTION THAT FOLLOWS HER AROUND, THE IDEA IT HAPPENED FOR\nTHE FIRST TIME LAST FRIDAY IS FICTION.\nPEOPLE DON'T TRUST HER. >> I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU.\nI TRY TO HEAR ALL YOUR THOUGHTS. WE'RE GOING TO YOUR CANDIDATE ON\nSTAGE AT A RALLY IN STERLING HEIGHTS, MICHIGAN.\nLET'S GO. >> THE WORST TRADE DEAL SIGNED\nBY ANY COUNTRY EITHER CHINA'S ENTRY INTO THE WORLD TRADE\nORGANIZATION, THE JOB KILLING DEAL WITH SOUTH KOREA.\nANOTHER BEAUTY THAT WAS A DISASTER.\nAND HILLARY NOW WANTS TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP.\nSHE CALLS IT THE GOLD STANDARD. HILLARY CLINTON'S POLICIES HAVE\nDEVASTATED YOUR AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY ALL TO THE BENEFIT OF\nSPECIAL INTERESTS. WE WILL PUT A STOP TO ALL OF\nTHAT OR NOVEMBER 8th. GET OUT AND VOTE, MICHIGAN.\nYOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE BEEN SEEING WHAT'S HAPPENING\nOVER THE LAST WEEK OR SO, BUT THEY ARE GOING WELL, THE VERY\nDISHONEST MEDIA, THE WORLD'S MOST DISHONEST PEOPLE.\nTODAY I WAS WATCHING. THEY ARE BAD PEOPLE.\nTHEY ARE BAD PEOPLE AND THEY ARE DISHONEST PEOPLE.\nTHEY DON'T TELL THE TRUTH. THEY DON'T WRITE THE TRUTH.\nI WILL SAY THIS, I WAS WATCHING THE POLLS.\nWE'RE LEADING IN IOWA. WE'RE LEADING IN IOWA.\nWE'RE LEADING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. JUST OUT.\n>> TRUMP TALKING ABOUT MICHIGAN. WE'LL LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAYS IF\nHE TALKS ABOUT FBI'S DECISION WE'LL BRING IT TO YOU LIVE.\nJOINING US ELIJAH CUMMINGS, DEMOCRAT, RANKING HOUSE\nCOMMITTEE AND OVERSIGHT REFORM. MR. CUMMINGS CALLED FOR JUSTICE\nDEPARTMENT INSPECTOR GENERAL TO INVESTIGATE WHERE THE FBI IS\nLEAKING INFORMATION THAT COULD BENEFIT DONALD TRUMP.\nMR. CUMMINGS THANKS FOR BEING OBJECT, SIR.\nWHERE ARE WE NOW FBI HAS COME OUT AND BASICALLY EXONERATED\nHILLARY CLINTON SAYING THERE'S NOTHING IN ANY OF THESE E-MAILS,\n50,000 OF THEM THAT IS ANYTHING MORE THAN A PREVIOUSLY E-MAILS?\n>> I'M GLAD THE FBI CLEARED THAT UP.\nI MUST SAY IT'S VERY ALARMING THAT DIRECTOR COMEY EVEN PUT OUT\nTHAT LETTER NINE DAYS AGO. I THINK THAT IT WAS VERY VAGUE.\nKEEP IN MIND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY VOTED SINCE THAT\nLETTER CAME OUT. SO WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW IT\nMAY HAVE AFFECTED THEM BUT IT DOES CONCERN ME.\nI STILL THINK THAT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL SHOULD TAKE A CLEAR LOOK\nAT THE FBI AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHERE ARE ALL THESE LEAKS COMING\nFROM. MY 20 YEARS OF PRACTICING LAW\nAND MY 20 YEARS OF BEING ON THIS COMMITTEE, I CAN TELL YOU I HAVE\nNEVER SEEN A SITUATION WHERE WE HAD SO MANY LEAKS COMING OUT OF\nTHE FBI. I THINK THAT WE'VE GOT TO TAKE A\nLOOK AT THAT. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE LAW.\nSUPPOSE THERE'S A FELLOWSHIP, I IMAGINE THERE IS, AMONG FORMER\nAND CURRENT FBI AGENTS, SO YOU RETIRE AT 65, WHATEVER, WHATEVER\nTHE OFFICIAL AGE IS. YOU RETIRE AND KEEP IN TOUCH\nWITH MEN AND WOMEN YOU WORK WITH.\nCALL THEM UP AT A PARTY AND SAY WHAT'S HAPPENED BACK THERE.\nTHEY SAY WE'RE NOT HAPPY ABOUT THIS INVESTIGATION OF HILLARY\nCLINTON, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH. JUST IN GENERAL TERMS SAY THEY\nARE STEAMED UP. IS THAT A CRIMINAL VIOLATION OR\nJUST SHOP TALK? >> I DON'T THINK THAT'S A\nCRIMINAL VIOLATION BUT IT IS NOT THE WAY THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO\nPROCEED. LET'S LOOK AT WHAT MAYOR\nGIULIANI DID. WHAT HE DID WAS HE TOOK\nINFORMATION FROM AGENTS AND THEN --\n>> HE SAYS FORMER AGENTS. >> YEAH.\nI SAID HE TOOK INFORMATION FROM FORMER AGENTS THAT HE SAID THEY\nHAD BEEN TAKEN FROM CURRENT AGENTS.\nWELL, THEN HE PUTS THAT INFORMATION OUT.\nI KNOW HE'S DENIED THINGS, WALKED IT BACK.\nBUT THE THING IS, WHAT HE BASICALLY DID WAS LAUNDER THE\nINFORMATION FROM THE CURRENT AGENTS.\nTHAT'S JUST NOT THE PROCEDURE. I'VE TALKED TO FIVE OR SIX\nPEOPLE, JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TYPE, FBI TYPE OVER THE LAST DAY OR SO\nAND THEY TOLD ME THAT JUST DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY AND HE\nSHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT. >> TRACKING A LEAK IS DIFFICULT.\nTHERE'S LEAKS ON CAPITOL HILL ALL THE TIME FROM STAFF PEOPLE\nOR MEMBERS. HOW DO YOU TRACK A LEAK THAT'S\nSO AMORPHIC, SOMEBODY TALKED TO RUDDY GIULIANI OR A FRIEND OF\nRUDDY GIULIANI. >> I HAVE TO TELL YOU I'M NOT\nSURE. I USE GIULIANI AS ONE.\nCHRIS, KEEP IN MIND, COME ON NOW, WE'VE HAD LEAKS COMING OUT\nOF FBI ALMOST EVERY DAY, SOMETIMES TWO AND THREE TIMES A\nDAY COMING OUT. AT SOME POINT THAT NEEDS TO BE\nDEALT WITH, BECAUSE WE HAVE A SITUATION HERE IN THIS COUNTRY,\nIT'S NOT SO MUCH WHAT THE FBI EVENTUALLY FINDS.\nJUST A PERSON BEING UNDER INVESTIGATION CAN BE EXTREMELY\nDAMAGING. NOW, GOING TO THIS CASE, WEE GOT\nALL OF THIS INFORMATION BEING LEAKED OUT ABOUT THESE CASES.\nBUT AGAIN, THAT'S NOT FAIR. IT WAS NOT FAIR TO HILLARY\nCLINTON. SHE COULDN'T DEFEND HERSELF\nAGAINST IT. I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, I THINK\nTHE ONE THING I DEMANDED OF OUR COMMITTEE AND OF THE AGENCIES\nTHAT COME UNDER US, I WANT THEM TO BE FAIR.\nI WANT THEM TO BE HONEST. I WANT THEM TO TREAT THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE APPROPRIATELY. >> TO MAKE YOUR POINT, WE HAD A\nBIG POLITICIAN IN PHILADELPHIA ABOUT 34 YEARS AGO HAD A HUGE\nLIABLE CASE FOR A LEAK COMING OUT GIVEN TO LOCAL BROADCASTING\nAFFILIATE. THEY PUT OUT THE FACT HE WAS\nGOING TO BE INDICTED. HE WON A BIG KILLING ON THAT.\nYOU CAN'T DO THAT. CAN'T THROW OUT THERE'S AN\nINDICTMENT, SOMETHING IS COMING WHEN IT'S NOT CLEAR.\nELIJAH CUMMINGS, THANK YOU, SIR.", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1478482117980.1478479428631.2c9efdc1-001b-462b-94e6-ce0de322a3e9.segment1.thumb.jpg", "channel": "356"}], "channel": "356"}], "words": [{"text": "investigation", "size": 2221}, {"text": "fbi", "size": 1602}, {"text": "information", "size": 2153}, {"text": "classified", "size": 754}, {"text": "said", "size": 3727}, {"text": "way", "size": 4706}, {"text": "foundation", "size": 1720}, {"text": "look", "size": 2510}], "id": 18, "value": 10, "summary": "investigation-fbi-information-classified-said-way-foundation-look"}, {"segments": [{"videos": [{"start": 658387, "length": 281546.0, "end": 939933, "date": 1478447435854, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1478449380210.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1478447433730-9548c8fd-2a3c-404d-a6b5-1ec943c22fc8-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=658.39,939.93", "text": ">>> WELCOME BACK.\nA NEW POLL TO REPORT.

FOUR COLLAR COUNTIES THAT THE\nSUBURBS COME OUT IN HIGH NUMBERS.\nSHE WAS HERE IN THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA.\nI'M TRYING TO CONNECT WITH VOTERS AFTER A NUMBER OF POLLS\nAND A NUMBER OF SURVEYS SHOWED THAT TRUMP'S OFFENSIVE COMMENTS\nABOUT WOMEN, HIS TAPE SUGGESTING THAT HE ENGAGED IN NOT JUST\nSEXUAL HARASSMENT BUT ASSAULT AND WAS BRAGGING ABOUT IT WAS\nREALLY HURTING HIM. HE WAS DOWN BY -- WELL I DON'T\nTHINK -- >> WELL THERE IS NOT --\n>> AND THAT HAS PRODUCED MOMENTUM FOR CLINTON -- ABOUT.\n>> BUT IT HASN'T SHOWN IN THE POLLS.\nAND I DON'T LIKE THE ASSAULT -- BECAUSE THAT IS ADJUDICATED IN A\nCOURT OF LAW.

TRUMP'S LIFESTYLE AND HIS USE OF VERNACULAR.\nISN'T IT TRUE THAT HILLARY CLINTON'S PROBLEMS WITH THE FBI,\nWITH THE FOUNDATION, COUNTERED THAT TO SOME EXTENT.\nBECAUSE IF WHAT YOU ARE SAYING WERE TRUE, THEN HE WOULD BE\nBEHIND BY TEN POINTS IN PENNSYLVANIA.\nTRUMP WOULD BE LOSING BY TEN. AND HE'S NOT.\nIT IS A STATISTIC CAL TIE. SO I'M SEEING A BALANCE HERE.\nI'M SEEING A LOT PENNSYLVANIA RESIDENTS NOT REALLY KNOWING\nWHAT TO DO. THIS WAY, THEY GO THAT WAY.\nNOW YOU SAY THEY SHIFTED BACK TO HILLARY CLINTON.\nDO YOU HAVE ANY DATA TO BACK THAT UP?\n>> WHAT IS STRIKING IS THAT THE MOST EXPENSIVE SENATE RACE IN\nTHE WHOLE COUNTRY IS PAT TOOMEY AGAINST KATIE -- AND THERE IS\n$130 MILLION SPENT ON THAT. AND WE'VE SEEN AN ABSOLUTELY\nAVALANCHE OF ADS BY BOTH THE CLINTON AND TRUMP CAMPAIGNS.\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN ADS PREDOMINANTLY FEATURE TRUMP\nHIMSELF SAYING OUTRAGEOUS OR OFFENSIVE OR UNSETTLED THINGS\nWHEREAS THE MOST TRUMP ADS THAT WE'VE SEEN RECENTLY HAVE BEEN\nROOTED IN FALSE HOODS, JUST TODAY FBI DIRECTOR COMEY CLEARED\nSECRETARY CLINTON AGAIN. OF ANY ISSUE RELATED TO THESE\nE-MAILS. AND MOST OF THE ATTACK ADS THAT\nWE'VE BEEN SEEING RECENTLY FROM TRUMP SUGGEST THAT THERE IS SOME\nCONSPIRACY AND SHE'S ABOUT TO BE CHARGED WITH SOME CRIME WHICH IS\nCLEARLY NOT TRUE. >> SHE'S NOT GOING TO BE CHARGED\nWITH A CRIME IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, THAT IS FOR SURE.\nBUT THEIR BOTH NEGATIVE ADS, CLINTON ADS ARE NEGATIVE TOWARD\nTRUMP AND TRUMP ADS ARE NEGATIVE FOR CLINTON RATHER THAN SAYING\nVOTE FOR ME BECAUSE I'M A GOOD GUY.\nAND THE TOOMEY, McGUNTY RACE, IT IS A TIE.\n>> IT IS A CLOSE RACE. >> MORNING CALL HAS IT -- TOOMEY\nUP BY ONE.

LET'S GO TO THIS STATE.\nI DON'T THINK DONALD TRUMP CAN BE THE PRESIDENT WITHOUT THE\nSTATE OF FLORIDA. PUT THAT IN HIS COLUMN UP TO 248\nCLOSER TO 270.

JOINING US NOW FROM\nPHILADELPHIA, SENATOR CHRIS KUNZ FROM DELAWARE.\nDELAWARE IS A SUBURB OF PHILADELPHIA BECAUSE IT'S A LOT\nEASIER TO LIVE IN PHILADELPHIA THAN IT IS IN SOME PORTIONS OF\nPENNSYLVANIA. SO YOU KNOW THE TURF.\nI'M GOING TO ASK YOU THE SAME THING I ASKED GOVERNOR\nHICKENLOOPER. WHY IS IT SO CLOSE IN\nPENNSYLVANIA? IT'S HISTORICALLY A DEMOCRATIC\nLEANING STATE. >> WELL, BILL, PENNSYLVANIA\nHASN'T VOTED FOR A REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT SINCE\n1988 AND I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO END UP BEING CLOSE ON\nTUESDAY. I THINK WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE\nON ELECTION DAY HERE IS THAT THE INVESTMENT THAT THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN HAS MADE IN THE GROUND GAME, THE FOCUS THAT THEY\nBROUGHT TO THEIR CAMPAIGN IN PLANNING AND PREPARING FOR\nELECTION DAY IS GOING TO ULTIMATELY PRODUCE A VERY STRONG\nTURNOUT ACROSS THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA --\n>> IF THAT'S TRUE -- >> AND A WIN FOR SECRETARY\nCLINTON. >> IF THAT'S TRUE, IF MINORITIES\nGO OUT IN PHILADELPHIA IN GREAT NUMBERS RIVALING BARACK OBAMA, I\nTHINK YOU'RE RIGHT. BUT YOU HAVE TO CEDE THAT IT IS\nA BATTLEGROUND STATE,  TRUMP'S GOT ANENT IN SCRANTON\nWHERE I STARTED IN CHANNEL 16. HE'S THERE AND 2.4 IS WITHIN THE\nMARGIN OF ERROR. AGAIN I'LL ASK YOU WHAT IS IT\nTHAT'S DRIVING THE TRUMP VOTE IN THE KEYSTONE STATE?\n>> IT WAS INTERESTING TO ME TO SEE MELANIA TRUMP HERE LAST WEEK\nBECAUSE THERE'S REAL NERVOUSNESS IN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN THAT\nTHEY'VE LOST THE REPUBLICAN WOMEN OF THE SUBURBS, THE FOUR\nCOLLAR COUNTIES THAT ARE THE SUBURBS OF PHILADELPHIA WHERE\nREPUBLICANS TYPICALLY COME OUT IN PRETTY HIGH NUMBERS.\nMELANIA WAS HERE IN THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA.\nI'M TRYING TO CONNECT WITH VOTERS AFTER A NUMBER OF POLLS,\nA NUMBER OF SURVEYS SHOWED THAT DONALD TRUMP'S OFFENSIVE\nCOMMENTS ABOUT WOMEN, HIS TAPE SUGGESTING THAT HE ENGAGED IN\nNOT JUST SEXUAL HARASSMENT BUT SEXUAL ASSAULT AND WAS BRAGGING\nABOUT IT WAS REALLY HURTING HIM. >> I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY\nDOUBT -- >> THAT'S PRODUCED REAL MOMENTUM\nFOR CLINTON. >> BUT IT HASN'T AGAIN SHOWN IN\nTHE POLLS. AND I DON'T LIKE THE ASSAULT\nBUSINESS BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT IS A WORD THAT HAS TO BE\nADJUDICATED IN A COURT OF LAW. BUT LET'S SAY THAT YOU'RE RIGHT,\nLET'S SAY THAT WOMEN IN PENNSYLVANIA WERE INITIALLY PUT\nOFF OR STILL ARE PUT OFF BY MR. TRUMP'S LIFESTYLE AND HIS USE OF\nVERNACULAR. ISN'T IT TRUE THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON'S PROBLEMS WITH THE FBI, WITH THE FOUNDATION COUNTERED\nTHAT TO SOME EXTENT? BECAUSE IF WHAT YOU ARE SAYING\nWERE TRUE, THEN HE'D BE BEHIND TEN POINTS IN PENNSYLVANIA.\nTRUMP WOULD BE LOSING BY TEN AND HE'S NOT.\nIT'S A STATISTICAL TIE. A LOT OF PENNSYLVANIAS NOT\nKNOWING WHAT TO DO. THIS WAY AND THAT WAY.\nYOU SAY IT SHIFTED BACK TO HILLARY CLINTON.\nDO YOU HAVE ANY DATA TO BACK THAT UP?\n>> WHAT'S STRIKING TO ME IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE SENATE RACE IN\nTHE WHOLE COUNTY IS PAT TOOMEY AGAINST KATIE McGINTY.\n$130 MILLION SPENT ON THAT. WE'VE SEEN AN AVALANCHE OF ADS.\nTHE CLINTON ADS CONTAIN TRUMP HIMSELF SAYING OUTRAGEOUS OR\nUNSETTLES THINGS WHEREAS THE MOST TRUMP ADS WE'VE SEEN\nRECENTLY HAVE BEEN ROOTED IN FALSEHOODS.\nJUST TODAY FBI DIRECTOR COMEY CLEARED SECRETARY CLINTON AGAIN\nOF ANY ISSUE RELATED TO THESE E-MAILS.\nAND MOST OF THE ATTACK ADS THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING RECENTLY FROM\nDONALD TRUMP SUGGEST THAT THERE IS SOME --\n>> BUT THE NEGATIVE ADS -- >> -- CONSPIRACY AND SHE'S ABOUT\nTO BE CHARGED WITH SOME CRIME, WHICH IS CLEARLY NOT TRUE.\n>> SHE'S NOT GOING TO BE CHARGED WITH A CRIME IN THE FORESEEABLE\nFUTURE, THAT'S FOR SURE. BUT THEY'RE BOTH NEGATIVE ADS,\nRIGHT, CLINTON ADS ARE NEGATIVE TOWARDS TRUMP AND TRUMP ADS ARE\nNEGATIVE TO CLINTON RATHER THAN VOTE FOR ME BECAUSE I'M A GOOD\nGUY. THE TOOMEY/McGINTY RACE, THAT'S\nA TIE. >> A VERY CLOSE RACE.\n>> ONE HAS TOOMEY UP BY ONE, GRAVIS HAS GOT McGINTY UP BY\nTWO. THOSE ARE THE LATEST NUMBERS\nTHAT HAVE COME IN. I REALLY THINK PEOPLE ARE\nCONFLICTED IN PENNSYLVANIA. FASCINATING TO SEE.\nI'LL GIVE YOU THE LAST WORD. >> WELL, I THINK WHAT WE'RE\nGOING TO SEE HERE TOMORROW NIGHT IS A TERRIFIC POSITIVE GET OUT\nTHE VOTE RALLY. AS YOU KNOW JOE BIDEN, MY\nPREDECESSOR IN THE SENATE, NATIVE OF SCRANTON,\nPENNSYLVANIA, IS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE CAMPAIGNERS AND\nCLOSERS IN AMERICAN HISTORY. I THINK WE'LL SEE HISTORY REPEAT\nON TUESDAY WHEN PENNSYLVANIA WILL ONCE AGAIN GO DEMOCRAT AND\nTHERE WOULD NOT BE A PATH TO VICTORY FOR DONALD TRUMP.\n>> I WANT BIDEN AND TRUMP, THEY WERE GOING TO DUKE IT OUT,\nWEREN'T THEY? THAT WOULD BE GOOD, IF WE COULD\nHAVE THAT MONDAY NIGHT, I'LL CARRY THAT LIVE.\nALL RIGHT, SENATOR, WE APPRECIATE IT.\nBERNIE GOLDBERG ON DECK.

COMEY WAS CAREFUL IN THE WAY HE\nWORDED A LETTER TO CONGRESS, WHICH READS IN PART, QUOTE,\nREVIEWING ALL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS GOING TO OR FROM\nHILLARY CLINTON AND WE HAVE NOT CHANGED OUR CONCLUSION EXPRESSED\nIN JULY WITH RESPECT TO SECRETARY CLINTON.\nOUR JUSTICE DEPARTMENT PRODUCER SAYS A SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT\nSOURCE TELLS HIM THE MATTER IS ESSENTIALLY CLOSED.\nLORETTA LYNCH SUPPORTED THE DECISION AND JUST A SHORT TIME\nAGO, DONALD TRUMP SPOKE FOR THE FIRST TIME ABOUT THE BIG NEWS.\nWATCH. >> YOU CAN'T REVIEW 650,000 NEW\nE-MAILS IN EIGHT DAYS. CAN'T DO IT, FOLKS.\nHILLARY CLINTON IS GUILTY. SHE KNOWS IT.\nTHE FBI KNOWS IT. THE PEOPLE KNOW IT.\nAND NOW, IT'S UP TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO DELIVER JUSTICE AT THE\nBALLOT BOX ON NOVEMBER 8TH. >> REMEMBER, FOR DONALD TRUMP,\nJAMES COMEY WAS VILLAIN, THEN, THE HERO, HE'S, BACK TO VILLAIN.\nTHIS WILL PLAY INTO HIS CAMPAIGN'S MESSAGE.\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS NOT SAID ANYTHING ABOUT THE NEWS BUT HER\nCAMPAIGN IS WEIGHING IN. BRIAN FOWLER TWEETING QUOTE,\nWE'RE CONFIDENT NOTHING WOULD CAUSE THE JULY DECISION TO BE\nREVISITED. NOW, DIRECTOR COMEY CONFIRMED\nIT. AND CAMP CLINTON IS RELIEVED,\nTHEY SAY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDO THE DAMAGE.\nPOLLS SHOW SHE LOST INDEPENDENTS AND G.O.P.  WOMEN WHO SHE WAS\nHOPING WOULD EXTEND HER LEAD. HERE IS VICE PRESIDENT NOMINEE,\nTIM KAINE. >> I FELT LIKE THE ORIGINAL\nCONCLUSION WAS SO UNEQUAL, SO I FELT LIKE THAT COULD BE THE\nCONCLUSION THEY WOULD REACH. >> IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO GET\nHUMA ABEDIN OFF THE HOOK. JOINING ME NOW, CONGRESSMAN TREY\nGOUDY WHO INVESTIGATED MRS. CLINTON.\nGREAT TO SEE YOU, CONGRESSMAN. YOUR REACTION TO DIRECTOR\nCOMEY'S ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY? >> WELL, I HAVE KIND OF FOCUSED\nON A WORD OF HIS LETTER WITH THE WORD CONCLUSIONS, PLURAL.\nHE HAD A LOT OF CONCLUSIONS IN JULY, INCLUDING SHE WAS CARELESS\nIN THE WAY SHE HANDLED CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.\nSHE DIDN'T TURN OVER ALL OF HER WORK E-MAIL AND QUOTE, SENT AND\nRECEIVED INFORMATION, INCLUDING THAT WHICH WAS MARKED\nCLASSIFIED. NOW, MAKING USE OF THE WORD\nCONCLUSIONS, TODAY, PLURAL WAS IMPORTANT.\n>> WE HAVE NOT CHANGED OUR CONCLUSIONS SINCE JULY.\nAND CLEARLY, THIS CLOSES A BOOK ON THE QUESTION OF CRIMINALITY\nIN SO FAR AS THE FEDS ARE CONCERNED AND HER E-MAIL.\nDOES IT NOT? .\n>> I DON'T THINK SO. I THINK IT CLOSES THE BOOK BASED\nON WHAT THEY KNOW NOW. INVESTIGATIONS ARE NEVER OVER\nUNLESS A STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS EXPIRED OR UNLESS JEOPARDY IS\nATTACHED SO THIS INVESTIGATION IS OVER BASED ON WHAT THEY KNOW,\nBUT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW, AND MEGYN, MY OTHER\nPOINT IS CAN YOU IMAGINE A CLOSING ARGUMENT OF HAVING TO\nSPEND, THE DAY BEFORE A GENERAL ELECTION, SAY, THE FBI WAS NOT\nABLE TO PROVE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT EVERY ELEMENT\nOF A CRIMINAL OFFENSE? >> YES.\n>> IF THAT IS THE CLOSING ARGUMENT FOR A PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATE THEY'VE GOT OTHER PROBLEMS.\n>> IN THE END SHE CHOSE NOT TO MENTION IT FOR THE VERY REASON\nYOU JUST SUGGESTED IS THAT IS HOW THEY WANT TO REENFORCE THEIR\nMESSAGE. THEY'RE SAYING THIS HAD A REAL\nAFFECT AND HEARD TRACE'S AFFECT ABOUT REPUBLICAN WOMEN WERE\nRELUCTANT TO OWE SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP.\nDO YOU THINK THE COMEY DECISION NINE, 10 DAYS AGO MIGHT HAVE\nBACKED, IF PERHAPS A PRESIDENTIAL RACE, IF NOT THAT,\nSOME OF THE SENATE RACES THAT HAVE BEEN TIGHT?\n>> I'LL TAKE HER DECISIONS OF IMPACTED FEMALE VOTERS AND\nINDEPENDENT VOTERS. I THINK IT'S JUST A REMINDER\nMOST OF WHAT SHE'S SAID HAS BEEN FALSE.\nTHAT IS NOT JIM COMEY'S FAULT. I'M NOT UPSET WITH JIM COMEY FOR\nSENDING THE LETTER TODAY, I THOUGHT HE HAD TO, JUST LIKE 8\nOR 9 DAYS AGO. SHE'S THE REASON WE'RE\nDISCUSSING THIS HOURS BEFORE A GENERAL ELECTION.\nNOT JIM COMEY. >> IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE.\nCOMEY HAD A LOT OF ATTACKERS OUT THERE.\nYOU DEFEND HIM. YOU THINK THE DECISION IN JULY\nWAS FOUND. YOU, TOO, ARE FACING REELECTION\nON TUESDAY. AND YOU KNOW, YOUR FAVORED TO\nWIN. THAT HASN'T STOPPED YOU FROM\nRELEASING ADS LIKE THIS ONE, WHICH I THINK OUR VIEWERS WILL\nENJOY, WATCH. >> THAT TREY GOWDY GOES AFTER\nTHEM, THE MAN IS FEARLESS, OBAMACARE, HILLARY,\nWASTEFUL SPENDING. >> CONSERVATIVE.\n>> YES. >> STEADY.\n>> GOT A GOOD HEAD ON HIS SHOULDERS.\n>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT HAIR, THOUGH.\n>> YOU STILL REMEMBER I'M STILL SITTING HERE.\n>> JUST SAYING. >> TREY GOWDY, CONSISTENT AND\nCONSISTENT HAIR CUTS. >> IT'S TRUE.\nI LIKE THAT YOU RECOGNIZE THAT ABOUT\nAND YOU KNOW THE FACIAL HAIR IS SLIGHTLY INCONSISTENT.\nIF YOU KNOW ABOUT IT, WHY DON'T YOU DO SOMETHING THERE?\n>> I HAVE HAD A LOT OF HELP IN RECOGNIZING THAT WEAKNESS OVER\nSIX YEARS. AND CAN TELL YOU THIS.\nI AM THE ONLY POLITICIAN IN AMERICA DUMB ENOUGH TO RUN A\nNEGATIVE ATTACK AD ON HIMSELF. I THOUGHT PEOPLE NEEDED TO LAUGH\nIN THE LAST COUPLE DAYS BEFORE AN ELECTION, I'D RATHER LAUGH AT\nME THAN POKE FUN AT SOMEBODY ELSE.\n>> WE DID NEED TO LAUGH, AND I CAN RELATE ON THE INCONSISTENT\nHAIR. THANK YOU.\n>> THANK YOU. >> JOINING ME NOW IN A KELLY\nFILE EXCLUSIVE, CHAIRMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE.\nGREAT TO SEE YOU. WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THE FBI\nTODAY? I KNOW YOU LIKED WHAT THEY DID\nNINE DAYS AGO. DO YOU LIKE WHAT THEY DID TODAY\nJUST AS MUCH? >> I WON'T WANT TO STEP ON THE\nELOQUENT WORDS OF CONGRESSMAN GOWDY.\nI THINK ANY TIME THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS TALKING ABOUT\nWHETHER OR NOT SHE GAVE AWAY SECRETS IS A SLOPPY MESSAGE.\nAND I ALSO AGREE, BEFORE TREY LAID IT OUT NICELY, BUT THERE IS\nNOTHING THAT SAYS THIS THING IS OVER.\nTHERE ARE GOING TO BE MORE E-MAILS.\nIT'S OVER IN REGARD TO THIS NEW TROVE OF E-MAILS, BUT THERE WILL\nBE MORE. AND SO THE POINT IS CAN SHE BE\nTRUSTED? THE ANSWER IS NO.\nSHE CAN'T BE TRUSTED WHEN SHE'S GIVEN ONE OF THE MOST-PRECIOUS\nJOBS IN AMERICA. SHE CAN'T GET OVER THE HUMP.\n>> IF THEY GET MORE EVIDENCE ON READING E-MAILS?\n>> WELL, YEAH. I THINK CONGRESSMAN GOWDY LAID\nIT OUT. IT'S THE TRUTH.\nI DON'T KNOW HOW MANY BLACK BERRIES SHE HAD.\nIF THEY FIND ANOTHER BLACKBERRY AND COMPUTER, IF THEY HAVE OTHER\nDOCUMENTS THEY'RE GOING TO REVIEW THEM.\nTHEY'LL BE ANOTHER LETTER BACK SAYING GUESS WHAT?\nWE FOUND THIS. NOW, WE'RE GOING TO RESTART.\n>> NOW, WE'RE A DAY AND A HALF OUT, I PEEN, THE DAY OF, AND I\nWANT TO OWE GET A FEEL WHERE FOR YOU THINK THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS.\nTHE LATEST NATIONAL POLLS SHOW HILLARY CLINTON HAS REBOUNDED,\nAND REGAINED HER NATIONAL LEAD, ONE POLL HAS HER FOUR POINTS UP.\n>> WELL, THERE ARE OTHER POLLS THAT SHOW TRUMP UP.\n>> JUST ONE. THE L.A. TIMES POLL.\nWHICH IS CONSISTENTLY SHOWING HIM UP.\n>> AND IBD POLL HAD TRUMP UP BY TWO POINTS.\n>> SHE'S UP ONE IN THAT ONE. >> I --\n>> YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK AT WHERE EARLY VOTE IS IN FLORIDA.\nWE'RE UP ABOUT 100,000 VOTES FROM WHERE WE WERE FOUR YEARS\nAGO. IN NORTH CAROLINA, UP ABOUT\n120,000 VOTES FROM NORTH CAROLINA.\nAND WE'RE UP IN A BIG WAY IN OHIO.\nWE'RE UP AS COMPARED TO 2012 IN A BIG WAY IN IOWA.\nWE'RE TIED IN MICHIGAN. IF NOT, SLIGHTLY AHEAD OR\nSLIGHTLY BEHIND BUT CLEARLY, BOTH OUR DATA AND THE CLINTON\nDATA IN MICHIGAN IS SAYING THE SAME THING, IT'S VERY, VERY\nCLOSE. THE SAME IS TRUE IN\nPENNSYLVANIA, AND THE SAME IS TRUE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND IN\nTHE SECOND JUDICIAL DISTRICT OF MAINE.\nYOU GO TO COLORADO, MEGYN, AND BALLOTS THAT HAVE BEEN COUNTED\nSHOW AT THE DEMOCRAT-REPUBLICAN REGISTRATION WE HAVE AN 1800\nPOINT LEAD. >> WHAT ABOUT NEVADA?\n>> SURE. >> ONE THE GUYS OUT THERE THAT\nTRACKS THE POLLS SAYS TRUMP IS FINISHED IN NEVADA AND HISPANIC\nTRUMP OUT HAS BEEN HISTORIC. >> WE LOVE JOHN.\nBUT YOU KNOW, HE SAYS THE SAME THING EVERY TWO YEARS ABOUT\nREPUBLICANS IN NEVADA. I DO LIKE JOHN.\nIT'S SOMETHING WE HEAR ALL THE TIME.\nIT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO THE GROUND GAME AND TRUMP'S CLOSING\nARGUMENT ON TUESDAY. ONE THING PEOPLE NEED TO\nUNDERSTAND, THIS IS THE TRUTH. WE'VE GOTTEN BETTER AT EARLY\nVOTE THIS YEAR COMPARED TO FOUR YEARS AGO AND BETTER TWO YEARS\nAGO THAN WE EVER HAVE. REPUBLICANS TEND TO VOTE ON\nELECTION DAY. THEY TEND NOT TO LIKE EARLY\nVOTING AND ABSENTEE BALLOT VOTING SO WE HAVE LAGGED OVER\nTHE YEARS IN THIS AREA. COMPLAINED ABOUT IT BUT DIDN'T\nGET GOOD AT IT. NOW, AS OF LATE WE'VE GOTTEN A\nLOT BETTER. >> LAST QUESTION.\nLAST QUESTION. YOUR PREDICTION ON ELECTORAL\nCOLLEGE FINAL? >> I THINK TRUMP IS GOING TO BE\nOVER 270. I PREDICT ONE OF THE BIG BLUE\nSTATES IS GOING TO GO TO DONALD TRUMP.\nWE'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT.\n25,000 PEOPLE TODAY, IN BOTH MINNESOTA AND MICHIGAN.\n>> HOW ABOUT THE SENATE? >> IT'S SOMETHING NO MATTER WHAT\nYOU THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE AT LEAST 52 IN THE SENATE.\nWE'LL HOLD A MAJORITY. >> YOU HEARD IT HERE.\nGREAT TO SEE YOU. THANKS FOR BEING WITH US.\n>> YOU BET. >> HERE TONIGHT, MO, GOOD TO SEE\nYOU. LET'S PICK UP WITH THAT .2\nREPUBLICANS ON, ANY DAY SHE'S TALKING ABOUT I AM NOT FACING\nCRIMINAL CHARGES FOR JEOPARDIZING NATIONAL SECURITY\nAND LETTING HER MADE PRINTOUT CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS IS A BAD\nDAY FOR HILLARY CLINTON. WHAT SAY YOU?\n. >> I DON'T THINK THERE IS A\nQUESTION THAT WHAT COMEY DID TWO FRIDAYS AGO THREW A WRINKLE INTO\nEVERYTHING. YOU KNOW, IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN\nA WORSE TIME, RIGHT? I MEAN FOR 10 DAYS, THIS SPECTOR\nOF, YOU KNOW ARE THEY REOPENING THE INVESTIGATION WITH HANGING\nOUT THERE ALLOWING THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN TO PROMISE THAT, YOU\nKNOW THERE HAS GOT TO BE SOMETHING BIG THERE.\nAND ALL OF THIS CONVERSATION IS HAPPENING AS EARLY VOTING WAS\nGOING ON. ONLY TO FIND OUT TODAY, THAT\nTHERE WASN'T ANYTHING BIG THERE. THAT THERE WASN'T ANYTHING NEW\nTHERE. THAT WOULD CHANGE THE JULY\nFINDINGS. SO I THINK THE COMEY DECISION\nTWO FRIDAYS AGO WAS A PROBLEM. FOR PRIMARILY, THE FBI.\nI DON'T THINK FOR THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN.\nHAVING SAID THAT, SHE'S GOING TO LEAD IT.\nAND YOU JUST POINTED OUT SHE'S REBOUNDING IN NATIONAL POLLS AND\nTAKING A PRETTY GOOD LEAD IN A COUPLE OF THE KEY BATTLE GROUND\nSTATES. AND WE'RE SEEING THE EARLY VOTE\nAMONG THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND HISPANIC COMMUNITY\nEXPLODING OVER THE PAST 3 OR 4 DAYS.\n>> WHERE? EARLY VOTES ABOUT THE AFRICAN\nAMERICAN TURN OUT HAD BEEN DISAPPOINTING THUS FAR.\n>> YOU'RE RIGHT. >> YOU'RE RIGHT.\nTHAT WAS AN EARLY REPORT. BASED ON WHAT WE SEE, TAKE A\nLOOK AT SOUTH FLORIDA. BROWARD COUNTY.\nWE'VE SEEN TURN OUT IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINO\nCOMMUNITIES BEGINNING TO OUTPACE WHAT WE SAW IN 2012.\n>> WHY IS SHE SO CONCERNED ABOUT MICHIGAN FROM THE APPEARANCE OF\nIT? >> LOOKS LIKE IT'S TIGHTENING\nUP, RIGHT? BUT AT THE SAME TIME --\n>> BUT PUT THAT INTO PERSPECTIVE FOR VIEWERS.\nHOW BIG OF A LOSS WOULD THAT BE FOR HILLARY CLINTON?\n>> YOU KNOW, WE'LL SEE HOW IT TURNS OUT, I THINK PEOPLE ON THE\nGROUND IN MICHIGAN AND CLINTON CAMPAIGN FEEL THEY'VE GOT TO DO\nLATE WORK HERE BUT WILL BE ABLE TO HOLD ONTO IT.\nHAVING SAID THAT, IT COULD SLIP. IT COULD GO RED THIS TIME.\nBUT IF SHE DOES LOSE MICHIGAN AND THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT.\nIF SHE DOES LOSE MICHIGAN, THE WAY THE MAP IS LOOKING NOW,\nTRUMP HAS TO RUN THE TABLES IN A BUVENL OF STATES THAT RIGHT NOW\nIT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE HE'LL BE ABLE TO DO.  HIS PATH TO 270 IS\nFAR MORE NARROW. SHE'S LOOKING GOOD IN\nPENNSYLVANIA. THE EARLY VOTE IN FLORIDA SHOULD\nGIVE DEMOCRATS A LITTLE BIT OF A BOUNCE IN THEIR STEP.\nNEVADA, YOU KNOW THESE ARE STATES THAT TRUMP HAS TO WIN IN\nORDER TO GET THERE. AS WELL AS PICK UP A MICHIGAN\nAND MAYBE ONE OTHER BLUE STATE. HE CAN'T DO ALL THAT.\n>> HAVE TO GET THE ROMNEY STATES AND STEAL ONE OF THE BLUE\nSTATES. >> THAT IS RIGHT.\n>> ONE WITH A LOT OF ELECTORAL VOTES, IDEALLY.\n>> MO, GREAT TO SEE YOU. >> YOU, TOO.\n>> ALMOST THERE. >> A HIGH STAKES GAME OF CHESS\nTHAT COULD DECIDE IT ALL. TWO OF THE COUNTRY'S TOP\nPOLITICAL ANALYSTS ARE NEXT. AND STIREWALT IS HERE.\nLOOK AT THAT PICTURE. DOESN'T THAT JUST MAKE YOU LOVE\nHIM? WITH A STATE BY STATE CHEAT\nSHEET.
