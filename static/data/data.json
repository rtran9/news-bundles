      "text": "THEM, WE KNOW THEY WERE NOT SENT\nBY HILLARY CLINTON AND WE KNOW THEY WERE E-MAILS NOT IN THE\nPOSSESSION OF THE FBI, IT WAS NOT ON ANYTHING THEY HAD\nPREVIOUSLY EXAMINED AS PART OF THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE\nCLINTON E-MAIL SERVER. WE DO KNOW ACCORDING TO\nOFFICIALS WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO THAT IT WAS -- THESE E-MAILS\nWERE FOUND ON A DEVICE THAT THE FBI DIDN'T HAVE IN ITS\nPOSSESSION DURING THAT YEAR-LONG INVESTIGATION.\nIN OTHER WORDS, IT WAS ON A DWAS THEY HADN'T PREVIOUSLY EXAMINED\nAND THAT HAS COME INTO THEIR POSSESSION AS PART OF AN\nUNRELATED INVESTIGATION. THAT INVESTIGATION, WE DON'T\nKNOW IT'S NOT RELATED TO THE WIKILEAKS INVESTIGATION.\nTHERE'S STILL QUESTIONS HERE THE FBI SENDING THREE PARAGRAPH\nLETTER TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS UPDATING THEM BECAUSE HE\nPREVIOUSLY TESTIFIED BEFORE CONGRESS AND THE THREE\nPARAGRAPHS NOW EVERYBODY IS TRYING TO PARSE EXACTLY WHAT HE\nSAYS BECAUSE HE SAYS IN CONNECTION WITH AN UNRELATED\nCASE THE FBI HAS LEARNED OF THE EXISTENCE OF E-MAILS THAT APPEAR\nTO BE PERTINENT TO THIS INVESTIGATION.\nIT'S IMPORTANT TO ADHERE THAT COMEY IS NOT SAYING HE KNOWS THE\nMATERIAL IS SIGNIFICANT. HE SAYS \"WE DON'T KNOW THE\nSIGNIFICANCE OF THIS BUT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE INVESTIGATIVE\nTEAM, THE TEAM FROM THE FBI'S COUNTERINTELLIGENCE DIVISION\" TO\nTAKE ANOTHER LOOK AND SEE WHETHER OR NOT THIS AFFECTS THE\nOUTCOME THAT COMEY ANNOUNCED BACK IN JULY SAYING HE WAS\nRECOMMENDING NO CHARGES AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON.\nOF COURSE 11 DAYS, BROOKE, BEFORE THIS ELECTION, THIS IS\nNOT SOMETHING THE FBI HAD ANTICIPATED.\nCOMEY HAD -- PRECISELY THIS IS THE THING HE WAS TRYING TO AVOID\nBY TRYING TO WRAP UP THAT INVESTIGATION BACK IN JULY TO\nMAKE SURE THE VOTERS HAD THE INFORMATION BEFORE THEY STARTED\nCASTING BALLOTS AND NOW THERE ARE OVER 10 MILLION PEOPLE\nWHO'VE ALREADY CAST BALLOTS WITH NEW INFORMATION COMES OUT FROM\nTHE FBI. >> AND MANY PEOPLE CASTING\nBALLOTS INCLUDING HERE IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA THIS WEEKEND\nAND THIS COULD BE ON THEIR MINDS.\nPHIL MATTINGLY, TO YOU, SIR, YOU WERE ON HILLARY CLINTON'S\nCAMPAIGN PLANE WITH MANY OF HER TOP ADVISORS, TOP AIDES AND THEY\nDIDN'T LEARN THE NEWS UNTIL YOU LANDED.\nWHAT WAS THEIR RESPONSE? >> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT, BROOKE.\nTHE FLIGHT USUALLY HAS WI-FI, WE CANNOT GET WI-FI OVER THE COURSE\nOF THE 2:20 FLIGHT FROM NEW YORK TO IOWA AND SO AS WE WERE\nLANDING EVERYBODY'S iPHONES AND BLACKBERRIES STARTED LIGHTING UP\nAT THE SAME TIME, INCLUDING HILLARY CLINTON'S CLOSEST\nADVISORS. AS WE WERE DEPLANING ONE OF THE\nADVISORS LOOKED AT ME AND SAID \"I'M LEARNING ABOUT THIS AT THE\nSAME TIME YOU ARE.\" SO IN TERMS OF WHAT EVAN WAS\nSAYING, THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS, THE STATE DEPARTMENT\nWASN'T AWARE OF THIS AS WELL, INCLUDING THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN\nON THAT. HILLARY CLINTON STARTED SPEAKING\nHERE BEHIND ME 20 MINUTES AGO, HASN'T ADDRESSED THE ISSUE\nSPECIFICALLY BUT SAID SOMETHING THAT MADE MY EARS PERK UP.\nSHE SAYS \"DONALD TRUMP STILL THINKS HE CAN WIN THIS ELECTION,\nAND YOU KNOW WHAT? HE'S RIGHT.\nANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.\" THAT WAS IN THE CONTEXT OF\nSOMETHING ELSE BUT ON A DAY LIKE TODAY WITH NEWS LIKE WE'VE BEEN\nGETTING OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST HOUR THAT RINGS\nPARTICULARLY TRUE. IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE\nWHEN HILLARY CLINTON ADDRESSES THIS.\nIT DOESN'T APPEAR LIKE IT WILL COME OUT DURING THESE REMARKS IN\nFRONT OF THIS IOWA CROWD IN CEDAR RAPIDS, BROOKE.\n>> MAYBE NOT THIS RALLY BUT AT SOME POINT I IMAGINE SHE WILL\nNEED TO RESPOND.",

HE SPOKE IN MANCHESTER, NEW\nHAMPSHIRE, SAYING THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HILLARY\nCLINTON'S BEING CORRUPT. HERE HE WAS.\n>> I NEED TO OPEN WITH A VERY CRITICAL BREAKING NEWS\nANNOUNCEMENT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]\nTHE FBI -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]\n-- HAS JUST SENT A LETTER TO CONGRESS INFORMING THEM THAT\nTHEY HAVE DISCOVERED NEW E-MAIL S PERTAINING TO THE FORMER\nSECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON'S INVESTIGATION.\n[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] [ CROWD CHANTING \"LOCK HER UP\" ]\nAND THEY ARE REOPENING THE CASE INTO HER CRIMINAL AND ILLEGAL\nCONDUCT THAT THREATENS THE SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES OF\nAME AMERICA.\nHILLARY CLINTON'S CORRUPTION IS ON A SCALE WE HAVE NEVER SEEN\nBE BEFORE.\nWE MUST NOT LET HER TAKE HER CRIMINAL SCHEME INTO THE OVAL\nOFFICE I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR THE FACT THAT THE FBI AND THE\nDEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ARE NOW WILLG TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO\nRIGHT TO HORRIBLE HIS STAKE THAT THEY MADE.\n[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS WAS A GRAVE MISCARRIAGE OF\nJUSTICE THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FULLY UNDERSTOOD AND IT IS\nEVERYBODY'S HOPE THAT IT IS TO BE CORRECTED.\n[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] >> THAT WAS DONALD TRUMP A\nLITTLE WHILE AGO, LET'S DISCUSS THIS, BRIANNA KEILAR IS BACK\nWITH ME, ALSO WITH US THE SENIOR POLITICS REPORTER FOR \"USA\nTODAY\" HEIDI PEREZ BELA AND JOSH GREEN.\nWELCOME TO ALL OF YOU. JUST TO REITERATE THE NEW PIECE\nOF INFORMATION WE HAVE FROM THE FBI THAT THIS LAW ENFORCEMENT\nOFFICIAL TELLING US THESE E-MAILS THAT ARE APPARENTLY THE\nONES IN QUESTION THAT ARE BEING REVIEWED, THIS IS FROM A DEVICE\nTHE FBI DIDN'T HAVE AND WE KNOW THESE ARE NOT HILLARY CLINTON'S\nSPECIFIC E-MAILS. THAT SAID, BRIANNA KEILAR, WE\nTALKED BEFORE HILLARY CLINTON TOOK TO THE STAGE THERE IN\nKREETDAR RAPIDS, IT APPEARS SHE WILL NOT BE ADDRESSING THAT IN\nTHE IMMEDIATE RALLY BUT YOU THINK SHE TALKS ABOUT IT BEFORE\nTHE END OF THE DAY TODAY? >> SORRY, BROOKE, ARE YOU\nTALKING TO ME? I HAVE ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE IN MY\nEAR. >> I AM, YES.\n>> SORRY ABOUT THAT. >> NO WORRIES.\nLET ME JUST -- GO AHEAD. >> I WAS GOING TO SAY I DON'T\nKNOW IF SHE'S GOING TO. RIGHT NOW THEY'RE FIGURING THIS\nOUT. SHE'S ADD THIS EVENT THAT'S NOT\nSURPRISING TO ME THAT WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HER ABOUT THIS OR SHE\nHASN'T USED IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE AS WE KNOW SHE LANDED\nTHERE IN CEDAR RAPIDS AND THERE HADN'T BEEN, ACCORDING TO OUR\nPHIL MATTINGLY, ANY WI-FI SO THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE\nAROUND HER, SOME OF HER TOP AIDES, WHO WEREN'T ABREAST OF\nWHAT WAS GOING ON AND YOU KNOW SO THEY'RE FORMULATING THAT.\nSHE'S OUT THERE CAMPAIGNING, SHE'S HERE AT THIS RALLY SO SO\nSHE DOESN'T HAVE HER HEAD TOGETHER WITH ANYONE ON HER TEAM\nTO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE NO\nDOUBT ON THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN WHO ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW\nTO DEAL BUT THIS IS I THINK A SITUATION WHERE THEY'RE TRYING\nTO FIND MORE INFORMATION. WE'RE GETTING IT AS WE SEE HERE\nTHAT WE HAVE A SOURCE SAYING THAT THIS DOESN'T HAVE TO DO\nWITH HER E-MAILS SO THEY'RE TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON WHAT'S\nGOING ON. I WAS TALKING TO A SOURCE\nFAMILIAR WITH SOME OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CAMPAIGN AND THE\nIMPRESSION OF THAT SOURCE WAS THAT THEY HADN'T HAD ANY KIND OF\nHEADS UP SO THEY'RE REALLY STARTING FROM ZERO HERE FIGURING\nOUT HOW TO RESPOND. >> JOSH GREEN, TO YOU.\nYOU'VE TALKED TO TIPTOP PEOPLE ON THE TRUMP SIDE.\nWE JUST HEARD TRUMP RESPOND A MOMENT AGO.\nTHE NEW PIECE OF THE REPORTING IS THAT THESE ARE NOT HILLARY\nCLINTON'S OWN E-MAILS THEY'RE TAKING A CLOSE LOOK AT BUT\nTHEY'RE STILL LOOKING AT E-MAILS THAT INVOLVED HER PRIVATE E-MAIL\nSERVER. DO YOU THINK THIS IS -- LET ME\nREPHRASE, HOW BIG OF A PRE-ELECTION DAY GIFT DO YOU\nTHINK THIS IS FOR TEAM TRUMP? >> THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN THINKS\nTHIS IS A HUGE ELECTION DAY GIFT.\nI JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH ONE OF TRUMP'S TOP ADVISORS WHO\nSAID \"WE'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO HEAR MORE FROM TRAUMP AND\nCERTAINLY NOT FROM THE CAMPAIGN ON THIS ISSUE.\nHE SAID \"WE DON'T WANT TO STEP ON COMEY'S LINES.\"\nSO THEY ARE HAPPY TO PULL BACK AND\nAND CEDE THE MEDIA SPOTLIGHT AND TRY TO GET THE STORY OFF OF\nTRUMP'S -- THE VOTER SUPPRESSION STORY WE WROTE ABOUT IN\n\"BUSINESSWEEK\" AND SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN\nDOGGING HIS CAMPAIGN RECENTLY. >> SO READING BETWEEN THE LINES\nFROM THIS TOP ADVISOR TO YOU, THEY'RE GOING TO LET COMEY DO\nTHE SPEAKING AND KEEP TRUMP QUIET.\nLET THE NEWS SPEAK FOR ITSELF. >> LET THE NEWS SPEAK FOR\nITSELF. THE PHRASE HE USED FOR ME WAS\n\"WE'RE GOING TO LET THIS BREATHE.\"\nTHEY WANT PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT IT ON CABLE NEWS, THIS IS\nOBVIOUSLY UNWELCOME NEWS FOR CLINTON AND THAT MEANS WELCOME\nNEWS FOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN SO ACCORDING TO MY SOURCES THEY'LL\nPULL BACK AND LET THIS BECOME THE FOCUS IN THE WEEKEND.\n>> HEIDI, TO YOU, JUST ON THE FACT THAT THE FBI DIRECTOR IS\nCOMING OUT AND DOING THIS WITH 11 DAYS BEFORE ELECTION DAY.\nHE HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY CRITICIZED FROM BOTH SIDES BUT\nHE'S INSERTED HIMSELF IN THE STORE RIP IN A KEY PART OF THIS\nRACE. WHY DO YOU THINK THIS IS\nHAPPENING? >> YOU KNOW, THERE ARE SOME\nEARLY REPORTS THAT LEGALLY HE HAD TO INFORM CONGRESS BUT THE\nBOTTOM LINE IS GIVEN THE TIMING OF THIS, IT IS A POLITICAL\nFOOTBALL AND WILL BE A POLITICAL FOOTBALL UNTIL AND IF HE\nPROVIDES MORE INFORMATION BECAUSE THIS IS TRICKLING OUT.\nALL WE KNOW IS THAT THERE WERE NEW E-MAILS FOUND.\nWE DON'T -- THEY AREN'T EVEN HER E-MAILS AND I BRING YOU BACK,\nBROOKE, TO THE INVESTIGATION ITSELF.\nI WATCHED ALL OF HIS TESTIMONY AND I REMEMBER CLEARLY THAT THE\nCASE WAS VERY MUCH BUILT AROUND ACCIDENT AND THAT WAS WHY IT WAS\nSO HARD TO REALLY GO AT HILLARY CLINTON ON THIS BECAUSE IT WAS\nINTENT TO TRANSFER CLASSIFIED INFORMATION AND WHETHER THE\nSERVER ITSELF AMOUNTED TO INTEND TO TRANSFER CLASSIFIED\nINFORMATION SO EVEN FINDING A CLASSIFIED E-MAIL ON THERE THAT\nSHE SENT OR RECEIVED DIDN'T SATISFY THAT BURDEN BECAUSE IF\nYOU REMEMBER THERE WAS AN E-MAIL IN THERE THAT WAS MARKED \"C\" IT\nWAS JUST LOWER DOWN AND THAT THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR COMEY TO\nFIND REASON TO PROCEED SO I THINK WE ALL NEED TO TAKE A BIG\nBREATH HERE AND I DO THINK THAT THAT DIRECTOR COMEY, GIVEN THE\nTIMING OF IT, IS GOING TO HAVE TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION.\n>> MAYBE THAT INFORMATION WILL BE FORTHCOMING.\nNEVERTHELESS, HILLARY CLINTON WILL HAVE TO RESPOND AND,\nBRIANNA, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WILL BE NOT TOO\nTERRIBLY FAR FROM WHERE I AM IN FLORIDA IN A COUPLE HOURS\nSTUMPING FOR HILLARY CLINTON AND I'M SURE MENTIONING THE SENATE\nRACE IN FLORIDA. HE HAS SAID YES HILLARY CLINTON\nHAS FLAWS, HOW DOES HE ADDRESS THIS?\n>> HE MIGHT NOT AT ALL. HE MAY WAIT TO LET THE CAMPAIGN\nADDRESS THIS AND SEE WHAT THEY DO.\nWE'VE BEEN SEEING HIM AND MICHELLE OBAMA AND OTHER REALLY\nBIG SURROGATES GOING INTO THE BATTLEGROUND STATES SO WHAT I\nWOULD EXPECT HIM TO DO FIRST AND FOREMOST IS TO MAKE A CASE FOR\nHILLARY CLINTON AS NOT SAY THAT SHE IS SOMEONE WHO'S GOING TO\nTAKE HIS BATON AND IS GOING TO BACK UP SOME OF HIS ACHIEVEMENTS\nAS PRESIDENT, MAKE SURE OBAMACARE IS PRESERVED AND\nTHAT'S WHAT I WOULD EXPECT TO HEAR FROM HIM AND I WOULD ALSO\nEXPECT TO HEAR HIM HIT DONALD TRUMP IN A BIG WAY.\nI DON'T KNOW THIS FOR SURE SO KEEP THAT IN MIND BUT I WOULDN'T\nEXPECT HE WOULD ADDRESS THIS. >> OKAY, THAT HAPPENS IN A\nCOUPLE OF HOURS, THE PRESIDENT IS IN ORLANDO.\nJOSH, ON THIS E-MAIL QUESTION FOR HILLARY CLINTON, SHE'S\nADDRESSED IT IN MULTIPLE DEBATES AND INTERVIEWS SHE'S GIVEN.\nIS IT FAIR TO SAY HER ANSWER HAS NEVER BEEN -- SHE'S STRUGGLED TO\nANSWER THE QUESTION, PUT IT THAT WAY?\n>> SHE HAD BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY TO DEFEND THIS.\nSHE SAID INITIALLY IT WAS JUST FOR CONVENIENCE OR FOR THIS OR\nTHAT AND CLEARLY THE OBJECT HERE WAS TO PROTECT OTHER PEOPLE FROM\nSEEING HER E-MAIL, WHETHER IT WAS CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS OR\nTHE FBI OR WHOEVER, IT WAS A MISTAKE, SHE'SING A NEW JERSEYED\nIT'S A MISTAKE. DEMOCRATS INCLUDING PEOPLE IN\nTHE WHITE HOUSE HAVE BEEN FRUSTRATED SHE DID THIS IN THE\nFIRST PLACE. THIS IS A SELF-CREATED PROBLEM\nFOR CLINTON AND SO IT'S UNFORTUNATE FOR HER BUT NOT\nENTIRELY UNEXPECTED IT WOULD REAR UP AT THE END OF THE\nCAMPAIGN JUST AS IT SEEMED LIKE CLINTON HAD THE MOMENTUM GOING\nIN TO ELECTION DAY. >> IS IT POSSIBLE, HEIDI, JUST\nTHINKING OF BRIANNA'S POINT ABOUT SHE'S NOT ADDRESSING IT AT\nTHE RALLY, THE PRESIDENT MAY NOT ADDRESS IN THE ORLANDO.\nIS IT POSSIBLE THE HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN LETS THE FBI\nTAKE THE LEAD ON THE INVESTIGATION AND THEY DON'T\nADDRESS IT? PERIOD?\nTHEY LET THE CLOCK RUN OUT? >> I WOULD BE SURPRISED, BROOKE,\nBECAUSE THE STAKES ARE SO HIGH AND WHAT THIS HAS SUCCEEDED IN\nDOING IS BASICALLY SHIFTING THE REFERENDUM OF THIS ELECTION TO\nBE ON TO HER WHICH THIS ENTIRE TIME THESE PAST FEW WEEKS IT'S\nBEEN ON DONALD TRUMP AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TWO CANDIDATES WHO\nHAVE HIGH NEGATIVE RATINGS AND THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN MANAGED TO\nKEEP THE FOCUS ON HIM. IF THEY DON'T ANSWER THIS AND\nPUSH THE FBI OR PUSH FOR MORE TRANSPARENCY ON WHAT IS GOING ON\nHERE, THEN IT LEAVES THAT OPEN, IT LEAVES THE DOUBT OPEN ABOUT\nWHERE WE'RE GOING WITH THIS AND AS YOU CAN SEE THE REPUBLICANS\nWILL WALK RIGHT THROUGH THAT DOOR AND SAY WELL IT MEANS SHE'S\nGOING TO BE INDICTED AND DRAW ALL KINDS OF CONCLUSIONS THAT\nMAY BE WILDLY INACCURATE SO I DON'T THINK THEY CAN AFFORD TO\nBE PASSIVE ABOUT IT. >> ANOTHER POINT, TOO, BROOKE --\n>> THEY HAVE TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE ADDRESSING BEFORE THEY\nADDRESS. >> IT HOW DO THEY KNOW WHAT\nTHEY'RE ADDRESSING, THOUGH? >> THAT'S RIGHT.\nWE'RE GETTING MORE INFORMATION, WHOSE E-MAILS?\nIS IT HERS? WE HAVE SOURCING SAY IT'S NOT SO\nTHESE ARE THINGS AS WELL THAT THEY ARE LEARNING AND IN ORDER\nFOR THEM TO FORMULATE A RESPONSE AND NOW HOW SHE SHOULD RESPOND\nAND WHAT SHE SHOULD RESPOND WITH THEY HAVE TO HAVE A BETTER SENSE\nOF WHAT THIS NEW STERILE THAT WOULD FORCE OPENING THE\nINVESTIGATION INTO THIS ALL OVER AGAIN.\n>> TO REITERATE IT WAS A DEVICE THEY DIDN'T HAVE FOR THE\nPREVIOUS INVESTIGATION AND THESE AREN'T HILLARY CLINTON'S\nE-MAILS. JOSH, GO AHEAD.\n>> I THINK IT'S IN THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN'S INTEREST TO PUT\nPRESSURE ON THE FBI TO EXPLAIN IN MORE DETAIL WHAT EXACTLY IT\nIS THAT THEY HAVE BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T INVOLVE HILLARY CLINTON\nAND HER PERSONAL E-MAILS, IF IT DOESN'T INVOLVE AS SEVERAL\nREPORTERS ON CNN WIKILEAKS OR THE CLINTON FOUNDATION THEN IT'S\nPROBABLY NOT AS A LOT OF PEOPLE -- ESPECIALLY REPUBLICANS\nAND ESPECIALLY DONALD TRUMP -- ARE ASSUMING IT IS SO GETTING\nMORE DETAIL IS PROBABLY SOMETHING THAT THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN WOULD LIKE GIVEN THE MEDIA REACTION IN THE HOUR SINCE\nTHE STORY BROKE. >> JOSH AND HEIDI AND BRIANNA,\nTHANK YOU ALL.",

WE HAVE SOME NEW INFORMATION\nHERE ON THIS NEWS FROM THE FBI, HOW THEY'LL BE REVIEWING SOME\nNEW E-MAILS AS IT ALL PERTAINED TO HILLARY CLINTON'S PRIVATE\nE-MAIL SERVER. I'LL LET EVAN PEREZ, OUR JUSTICE\nCORRESPONDENT, TELL YOU WHAT HE HAS NOW LEARNED.\nEVAN PEREZ, THE FLOOR IS YOURS. >> BROOKE, WHEN WE LAST TALKED A\nFEW MINUTES AGO ONE OF THE THINGS WE WERE TRYING TO NAIL\nDOWN WAS WHAT UNRELATED INVESTIGATION -- WHAT PROMPTED\nTHE FBI TO DISCOVER THESE NEW E-MAILS AND WE NOW KNOW, THE FBI\nHAS BEEN TAKING A LOOK AT ANTHONY WEINER AND HIS ALLEGED\nSEXTING WITH AN UNDERAGED -- WITH AN UNDERAGED GIRL.\nTHE FBI HAS BEEN TAKING A LOOK AT WHETHER OR NOT HE COMMITTED A\nCRIME IN THAT CASE. AS PART OF THAT INVESTIGATION,\nTHE FBI HAS BEEN EXAMINING COMPUTERS AND OTHER DEVICES THAT\nWERE SHARED BY ANTHONY WEINER AND HIS BIEWIFE, HOUMA ABEDIN,\nCLOSE AIDE TO HILLARY CLINTON AND WE'RE TOLD THOSE ARE THE\nDEVICES THEY WERE EXAMINING IN THAT CASE IS HOW THEY UNCOVERED\nTHESE NEW E-MAILS. AGAIN, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE\nE-MAILS CONTAIN, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT SIGNIFICANCE THEY WILL HAVE\nTO THIS INVESTIGATION. IT MAY WELL BE THAT THEY DON'T\nCONTAIN SERIOUSLY -- HIGHLY CLASSIFIED INFORMATION, HOWEVER\nTHE FBI IS NOW GOING THROUGH THAT PROCESS, THE PROCESS THEY\nSPENT A YEAR DOING AS PART OF THIS HILLARY CLINTON E-MAIL\nINVESTIGATION, THEY'RE GOING TO CHECK WITH THE OTHER AGENCIES,\nTHE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES THAT MAY OWN THIS INFORMATION TO\nDETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS CLASSIFIED AND WHETHER OR NOT\nTHIS CHANGES THE OUTCOME OF THIS CASE AS YOU REMEMBER.\nBACK IN JULY, THE FBI DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH\nEVIDENCE TO BRING CHARGES AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON.\nHOWEVER THIS NEW EVIDENCE NOW OBVIOUSLY IS GOING TO MAKE THEM\nTAKE A NEW LOOK. AGAIN, THESE E-MAILS WERE\nUNCOVERED AS PART OF THISANTHON AND CASE IS STILL ONGOING.\n>> SO JUST SO I'M CRYSTAL CLEAR, THE BREAKING NEWS WAS PART OF\nTHE ANTHONY WEINER SEXTING SCANDAL THAT HAS BEEN BROUGHT\nBACK INTO THE SPOTLIGHT BECAUSE THE FBI HAS DEEMED THIS\nPERTINENT TO THE INVESTIGATION INTO HILLARY CLINTON'S PRIVATE\nE-MAIL SERVER? >> THAT'S RIGHT.\nRIGHT, THEY HAD PREVIOUSLY OTHER DEVICES BUT THEY DID NOT HAVE\nTHIS DEVICE THAT THEY FOUND THESE E-MAILS.\nTHEY DID NOT HAVE THAT IN THEIR POSSESSION UNTIL THEY BEGAN\nDOING THIS ANTHONY WEINER INVESTIGATION WHICH WE\nPREVIOUSLY REPORTED IS ONGOING. WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THESE\nE-MAILS WERE, WE DO KNOW THEY WERE NOT SENT BY HILLARY\nCLINTON, WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY IF IT WAS HOUMA ABEDIN THAT SENT\nTHE E-MAILS OR WHETHER SHE WAS THE RECIPIENT OF THESE E-MAILS\nBUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WAS NOW VIEWED TO BE PERTINENT TO\nTHE INVESTIGATION, THAT'S WHY THE FBI IS TAKING A NEW LOOK.\n>> GOT IT. I GOT IT.\nWELCOME TO 2016. EVAN PEREZ, THANK YOU FOR THE\nUPDATE. WE HAVEN'T HEARD YET FROM\nPARTISANS ON ALL OF THIS SO LET'S DO IT.\nTRUMP SUPPORTER KAYLEIGH McENANY IS WITH ME, YOU JUST HEARD THE\nLATEST DEVELOPMENT ON THE -- WELL, YOU HEARD IT.\nKAG KAYLEIGH, WHAT DO YOU THINK?\n>> THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED FOR THE FBI TO OPEN WHAT WAS A CRIMINAL\nINVESTIGATION INTO SOMEONE'S SERVER WHO IS NOW RUNNING AS THE\nDEMOCRATIC NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT.\n>> WE KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THIS IS WHAT THE DOCUMENTS ARE\nRELATED TO, RELATED TO THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION INTO\nHILLARY CLINTON'S SERVER, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FBI HAS BUT\nWE DO KNOW IT'S RELATED TO THAT AND THERE WERE A LOT OF US\nSTARTING WITH DONALD TRUMP OUT THERE SAYING SOMETHING IS GOING\nON HERE, YOU HAVE FIVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN GIVEN IMMUNITY,\nYOU HAVE ASSOCIATES HAMMERING BLACKBERRIES TO COVER THIS UP.\nSOMETHING DID NOT SEEM RIGHT AND NOW WE KNOW THIS INVESTIGATION\nIS RENEWED AND IF HILLARY CLINTON BECOMES PRESIDENT OF THE\nUNITED STATES SHE MAY VERY WELL BE SUBJECT TO A CRIMINAL\nINVESTIGATION. >> BASIL, YOUR TURN?\nHOW WOULD YOU RESPOND? >> I'D LIKE TO PUMP THE BRAKES A\nLITTLE BIT ON THAT BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE SPECULATING DOWN A\nPATH THAT IS REALLY NOWHERE -- WE SHOULDN'T BE GOING DOWN.\nALL WE NOW RIGHT NOW IS THAT THERE IS A DEVICE THAT THE FBI\nDID NOT HAVE THAT THEY NOW HAVE. THEY'RE ASKING MORE QUESTIONS.\nWE DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE QUESTIONS ARE BUT WE ALSO KNOW\nTHE E-MAIL -- THEY WERE E-MAILS NOT SENT FROM HILLARY CLINTON'S\nSERVER THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS NEW RENEWED INVESTIGATION.\nSO THAT'S ALL WE KNOW. I DON'T WANT TO START\nSPECULATING AS TO WHETHER -- WHAT SHE SAID, WHAT SHE DIDN'T\nE-MAIL BACK AND FORTH. IF I BELIEVE THAT THE FBI\nDIRECTOR SAID THIS CASE WAS CLOSED I BELIEVE HE DID A\nTHOROUGH ENOUGH INVESTIGATION TO WARRANT THAT.\nI WOULD HOPE THAT WHATEVER HAS LED HIM DOWN THIS PATH AT THIS\nPOINT WILL BE QUICKLY WRAPPED UP AND WE CAN GET ON THE BUSINESS\nOF THE LAST 11 DAYS. WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO HAVE\nTO DEAL WITH THIS NOW BUT, YOU KNOW, I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT\nWHATEVER IS GOING ON AT THIS POINT THAT WE'LL HAVE A QUICK\nWRACKUP TO IT. WE CAN MOVE ON ABOUT THIS\nBUSINESS OF THIS COUNTRY. >> LET ME ASK WITH YOU TO STAND\nBY. WE'RE ALSO GETTING -- HANG ON,\nKAY KAYLEIGH.\nWE'RE GETTING REACTION FROM MEMBERS OF CONGRESS.\nLET'S GO TO MANU RAJU. HE'S TALKING TO FOLKS ON CAPITOL\nHILL. MANU WHAT ARE YOU HEARING?\n>> BROOKE, REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THEY FINALLY FOUND A RALLYING\nCRY AFTER MONTHS OF DISCORD. PAUL RYAN, HE HAS NOT UTTERED\nDONALD TRUMP'S NAME PUBLICLY SINCE THE RELEASE OF THAT\n\"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD\" VIDEO BUT MOMENTS AFTER THIS LETTER BY THE\nFBI WAS RELEASED BY SENATE REPUBLICANS, RYAN ISSUING THE\nSTATEMENT SAYING CLINTON SHOULD BE DENIED CLASSIFIED BRIEFING\nAND HOW VULNERABLE HOUSE AND SENATE REPUBLICANS HAVE AN ISSUE\nTO SEIZE UPON. THEY'RE MAKING THIS ARGUMENT,\nBROOKE, KEEP CONGRESS IN GOP HANDS AND THE CHECK AGAINST THE\nEXECUTIVE BRANCH. THIS IS THE POINT THAT DARRELL\nISSA, THE CALIFORNIA CONGRESSMAN WHO'S IN A VERY DIFFICULT\nREELECTION FIGHT SAID IN A STATEMENT SAYING CONGRESS NEEDS\nTO BE -- THEY NEED TO ELECT A REPUBLICAN -- THIS DECISION\nSHOWS EXACTLY WHEY WE NEED STRONG WATCHDOGS IN CONGRESS TO\nENSURE THOROUGH OVERSIGHT OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH.\nPEOPLE THAT WE HAVE NOT HEARD YET FROM ARE DEMOCRATS,\nPARTICULARLY ONES IN DIFFICULT REELECTION RACES.\nSOME OF THEM HAVE ALREADY GIVE AN PASS TO CLINTON ON THE E-MAIL\nISSUE BUT WE EXPECT TO HEAR MORE FROM THEM NOW.\nTHEY WILL BE FORCED TO RESPOND SO HOW WILL THEY RESPOND.\nWE DENT KNOW YET, BROOKE. ONE OTHER POINT OF NEWS, CHUCK\nGRASSLEY, THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN, SAYING HE IS\nREQUESTING A PRIVATE BRIEFING WITH THE FBI TO LEARN MORE ABOUT\nTHIS NEW PROBE SO REPUBLICANS CLEARLY ARE SEIZING ON THIS\nBELIEVING THEY FINALLY HAVE A CAMPAIGN ON AND AN ISSUE WILL\nHOUND HILLARY CLINTON IF SHE WERE TO BECOME PRESIDENT,\nBROOKE. >> THERE'S SO MUCH WE DON'T\nKNOW. THERE'S SENATOR GRASSLEY TRYING\nTO GET MORE, MANU, THANK YOU SO MUCH.\nLET ME BRING BASIL AND KAYLEIGH BACK IN.\nBASIL, I WAS TALKING TO CONGRESSMAN PATRICK MURPHY A\nLITTLE WHILE AGO, HE'S A TOUGH FIGHT WITH THE INCUMBENT SENATOR\nMARCO RUBIO WHO WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE BEEN PRESIDENT AND THIS\nIS SORT OF THE LAST THING A DEMOCRAT WOULD WANT TO HAPPEN\nEVEN IF, BY THE WAY, THIS AMOUNTS TO NOTHING WE MAY NOT\nKNOW THAT UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION.\nHOW SHOULD DEMOCRATS DOWN BALLOT HANDLE THIS?\n>> I TELL YOU, AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STATE PARTY HERE\nIN NEW YORK DOWN BALLOT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO ME AND\nTO US BECAUSE WE WANT TO ELECT PEOPLE TO HELP HILLARY CLINTON\nGOVERN AND I WOULD SAY TO PATRICK MURPHY AND TO OTHERS,\nTHERE'S NOTHING -- WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO SPECULATE.\nTHE LAST THING I WOULD WANT ANYBODY TO DO IS SPECULATE.\nWE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SAY TO THE VOTERS AND TO EACH OTHER QUITE\nFRANKLY, IS THAT WE HAVE BEEN THERE WITH HILLARY CLINTON, WE\nTRUST AND SUPPORT HILLARY CLINTON AND WE KNOW SHE WOULD BE\nA GOOD PRESIDENT FOR US AND FOR THE COUNTRY.\nTHAT'S WHAT WE HAVE BEEN SAYING THROUGHOUT THE CONVERSATION\nABOUT E-MAILS WITHIN THE LAST YEAR OR SO.\nI THINK THE VOTERS HAVE MADE UP THEIR MINDS ABOUT IT.\nAGAIN, I SAID THIS BEFORE, THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT SOMETHING THAT\nI WANT TO HAVE TO TALK ABOUT 11 DAYS OUT, BUT I THINK THAT -- I\nTHINK THERE ARE SUPPORTERS ON THE GROUND WHO ARE OUT THERE IN\nNEW YORK AND IN OTHER STATES THAT ARE PUSHING HILLARY\nCLINTON'S MESSAGE AND I THINK VOTERS WHEN THEY LOOK AT HER\nABILITY TO GOVERN VERSUS DONALD TRUMP'S I THINK THEY'LL MAKE THE\nDECISION TO STAY WITH HER. >> BASIL, I UNDERSTAND --\n>> KAYLEIGH -- >> I UNDERSTAND BASIL'S APPEAL",

YOU'RE WATCHING CNN.\nBACK TO OUR BREAKING STORY ON THE FBI REOPENING ITS\nINVESTIGATION INTO HILLARY CLINTON'S PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER.\nLET'S GO STRAIGHT TO ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO IS RUNNING AGAINST\nHILLARY CLINTON. HE IS LIBERTARIAN PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATE GARY JOHNSON. GARY, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR\nJOINING US AGAIN. >> BROOKE, APPRECIATE YOU HAVING\nME ON. >> SO, SIR, I AM SURE YOU HAVE\nBEEN PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS BREAKING STORY AND THE NEWS FROM\nJAMES COMEY. YOUR REACTION?\n>> WELL, OBVIOUSLY THE FBI DIDN'T DO THIS LIGHTLY.\nTHERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING THERE BECAUSE YOU JUST DON'T DO THIS\n11 DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION KNOWING THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO\nBE ABLE TO CONCLUSION THE INVESTIGATION IN 11 DAYS AND\nTHEN SEPTEMBER WHEN THEY DROPPED THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION I\nTHINK THEY WERE MAKING A STATEMENT THEN THAT, LOOK, THEY\nDID NOT WANT A POTENTIAL PRESIDENT-ELECT TO BE UNDER\nCRIMINAL INVESTIGATION, BUT THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO NOW BE\nTHE CASE IF SHE IS ELECTED AND SHE WILL CONTROL THOSE JOBS THAT\nCONTROLS HOW THIS ISSUE MOVES FORWARD, WHICH POINTS TO A\nSPECIAL PROSECUTOR, REALLY OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A MESS.\nIT'S A MESS. FOUR MORE YEARS OF THIS --\n>> SO YOU SAY, GOVERNOR? >> AND I --\n>> GO AHEAD. >> I DO THINK TRUMP IS TOAST SO\nHILLARY MOVING FORWARD AS COLLECT, FOUR YEARS OF THIS?\nUGH. I'M HOPING I'M GIVING A --\n>> GOVERNOR, WHY DO YOU THINK -- SORRY, WHY DO YOU THINK --\nDONALD TRUMP HAS JUMPED ON THIS, THIS IS LIKE AN EARLY ELECTION\nDAY GIFT FOR THE REPUBLICANS, WHY DO YOU THINK DONALD TRUMP IS\nTOAST? >> ALL THE REVELATIONS ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP I JUST -- YOU KNOW I THINK PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO\nVOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP. I'VE BEEN SAYING, LOOK, DON'T\nVOTE FOR HILLARY CLINTON. I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF\nISSUES REGARDING THE THINGS SHE'S OPENLY TALKING ABOUT,\nGROWING GOVERNMENT, RAISING TAXES.\nI DO THINK THERE ARE REAL ISSUES WITH PAY TO PLAY, THESE\nWIKILEAKS SAYING ONE THING TO ONE GROUP AND ANOTHER THING --\nSAYING ONE THING TO WALL STREET AND ANOTHER THING TO MAIN S\nSTREET. TO ME BOTH SIDES -- IT DOESN'T\nCUT IT, EITHER SIDE. I THINK THERE'S AN HONORABLE\nALTERNATIVE, IT HAPPENS TO BE ME AND BILL WELD, TWO FORMER\nREPUBLICAN GOVERNORS THAT SERVED IN HEAVILY DEMOCRAT STATES.\nHEY, MAYBE WE WILL STILL OCCUPY THE WHITE HOUSE.\nMAYBE IT'S A POSSIBILITY HERE, WHAT DO YOU THINK?\n>> THAT'S FOR YOU, GAUCHE, TO GET TO FIGURE IT OUT.\nTHIS IS PERHAPS AN OPENING FOR YOU TO SEIZE UPON.\nIF THIS WERE HAPPEN TO YOU WITH 11 DAYS TO GO THE FBI REOPENING\nAN INVESTIGATION INTO YOUR PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER, HOW WOULD\nYOU HANDLE THIS? WE KNOW HILLARY CLINTON HAS TO\nRESPOND TO IT. HOW WOULD YOU?\n>> YOU KNOW, BROOKE, IT WOULD HAVEN'T GOTTEN THIS FAR IF WHAT\nI HAD DONE -- IF I HAD MADE A MISTAKE I'D HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY\nTRANSPARENT REGARDING THE MISTAKE AND IF IT ENDED UP TO\nBE, WELL, IN THIS CASE THE CONJECTURE IS THAT IT IS\nCRIMINAL, I'D LIKE TO THINK I WOULD HAVE NEVER ENGAGED IN\nANYTHING CRIMINAL, NEVER HAVING ENGAGED IN ANYTHING CRIMINAL IN\nMY LIFE, BUT THAT IT GETS TO THIS POINT RIGHT NOW, THERE'S\nREALLY NOTHING SHE CAN DO. THERE'S JUST GOING TO BE\nCONJECTURE OVER WHAT IT IS THE FBI HAS.\nTHEY'RE NOT GOING TO RELEASE WHAT IT IS THEY HAVE AND YET\nTHEY HAVE DONE THIS BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT\nTHERE AND IF THEY DON'T DO IT THEN THEY DON'T LIVE UP TO THEIR\nRESPONSIBILITIES AND THE JOBS THAT THEY HAVE TALKING ABOUT\nCOMEY AND LORETTA LYNCH. >> I DO THINK WE HAVE TO BE\nCAREFUL IN CONJECTURE. WE DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS\nCRIMINAL. THE PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS, THE\nCONCLUSION WAS NOT CRIMINAL, AGAIN, WE DON'T KNOW YET.\nTHERE'S UNFORTUNATELY SO MUCH, THINKING OF VOTERS, THAT WE\nDON'T KNOW WITH 11 DAYS TO GO. YOU MENTIONED WIKILEAKS,\nGOVERNOR. LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT -- AND THE\nDEMOCRATS WILL SAY IT'S RUSSIA WHO'S BEEN HACKING THE E-MAILS\nBUT SOME OF THIS, REALLY, THE CLINTONS' FOLKS HAVE NOT BEEN\nDISPUTING. THIS BLURRED LINE BETWEEN THE\nCLINTON FAMILY, LEARNING ABOUT THE TENS OF MILLIONS BILL\nCLINTON WAS RECEIVING ALL THE WHILE THEY WERE RAISING MONEY\nFOR THE CLINTON FOUNDATION. IF SHE WERE TO WIN THE WHITE\nHOUSE DO YOU THINK THE CLINTON FOUNDATION SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN?\n>> ABSOLUTELY. I MEAN, IT IS A CONFLICT OF\nINTEREST, IT'S PAY TO PLAY. THESE SPEAKING FEES WERE BEING\nPAID TO BILL AND FAVORS WERE BEING GRANTED, CRONY CAPITALISM\nIS WHEN GOVERNMENT PICKS WINNERS AND LOSERS, I THINK WHAT\nWIKILEAKS SHOWS IS THAT THE CLINTONS MAKE WINNERS AND\nLOSERS. YOU CAN PAY TO WIN AND\nGOVERNMENT DOESN'T NEED TO BE THAT WAY.\nTHE THAT'S THE OTHER THING I WOULD LIKE TO STRESS, IT DOESN'T\nHAVE TO BE THIS WAY. GOOD GOVERNMENT IS EASY, IT'S\nNOT HARD AND IT START WITH HONESTY AND TRANSPARENCY.\n>> YOU MENTIONED A SECOND AGO THAT THIS COULD BE AN OPENING\nFOR YOU AND FOR YOUR TICKET, YOU HAVE HAD YOUR OWN FAIR SHARE OF\nGAFFES, GOVERNOR, YOU HAVE BEEN SINKING IN THE POLLS.\nWHAT COULD THIS MEAN FOR YOU? >> WELL, WE'LL SEE.\nYOU KNOW, GAFFES ARE ONE THING, INTEGRITY IS ANOTHER THING.\nLIKE I -- THE PITCH WE CONTINUE TO MAKE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO GUESS\nWITH REGARD TO TWO FORMER GOVERNORS -- MYSELF AND BILL\nWELD -- WE DID SERVE TWO TERMS EACH IN HEAVILY DEMOCRAT STATES,\nWE WEREN'T WALL FLOWERS. WE WERE FISCALLY CONSERVATIVE,\nWE WERE SOCIALLY INCLUSIVE. WE'RE REALLY SKEPTICS WHEN IT\nCOMES TO MILITARY INTERVENTIONS REGIME CHANGE AND WE'D BE THE\nONLY FREE MARKET CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.\nWE'RE ON THE BALLOT IN ALL 50 STATES.\n>> INCLUDING RIGHT HERE IN FLORIDA.\nGARY JOHNSON, GOVERNOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JUMPING IN\nREACTING TO THE BREAKING NEWS, WE APPRECIATE IT.\n>> APPRECIATE YOU HAVING ME ON,",

WE'LL TALK THE SIGNIFICANCE OF\nFLORIDA, BOTH DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON'S PATH TO THE\nWHITE HOUSE THROUGH THIS STATE. FIRST THE BREAKING STORY FROM\nTHE FBI TODAY, FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY REOPENING THE\nINVESTIGATION INTO HILLARY CLINTON'S PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER.\nHE'S ALLOWING HIS INVESTIGATORS TO REVIEW E-MAILS -- WE DON'T\nKNOW WHOSE E-MAILS THEY ARE, BY THE WAY, TO DETERMINE WHETHER\nTHEY CONTAIN CLASSIFIED INFORMATION AND ASSESS THEIR\nIMPORTANCE IN THE INVESTIGATION. BY THE WAY IT'S ALSO VERY\nUNLIKELY WE WILL GET ANY CONCLUSION TO THIS INVESTIGATION\nBEFORE ELECTION DAY, REMINDER, IT'S 11 DAYS AWAY.\nMICHELLE KOSINSKI IS OUR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT.\nSHE IS STANDING BY. ALSO A REMINDER TO EVERYONE, THE\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WILL BE BACK IN THIS CRUCIAL\nBATTLEGROUND STATE OF FLORIDA IN JUST A COUPLE OF HOURS FROM NOW,\nOBVIOUSLY SOMETHING FOR HILLARY CLINTON AND I'M SURE HE'LL\nMENTION THE SENATE RACE AS WELL. BUT MICHELLE KOSINSKI, ON THIS\nBREAKING NEWS, THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF HAS SAID SHE HAS FLAWS.\nHOW WILL HE ADDRESS THIS? >> YEAH, THAT'S THE BIG QUESTION\nHERE, YOU KNOW THE WHITE HOUSE IS WORKING ON HOW TO RESPOND TO\nTHIS. THEY HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING YET\nTHEY'RE NOT RESPONDING TO REQUESTS AT THIS POINT.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA JUST LEFT THE BOWES EN ROUTE TO FLORIDA.\nREPORTERS WERE YELLING A BARRAGE OF QUESTIONS AL AT HIM ON THE\nSUBJECT AND HE DIDN'T ANSWER THEM AT THIS POINT.\nBUT YOU KNOW THIS REMINDS ME OF THE FIRST TIME HE APPEARED ON\nTHE TRAIL SIDE BY SIDE WITH HILLARY CLINTON IT WAS IN NORTH\nCAROLINA AND THAT, REMEMBER, WAS ON THE VERY SAME DAY THAT JAMES\nCOMEY ANNOUNCED HIS FINDINGS OF THAT INITIAL INVESTIGATION.\nNEITHER THE PRESIDENT NOR HILLARY CLINTON MENTIONED ANY OF\nTHAT IN THEIR ADDRESS TO THE CROWD THAT DAY AND IT COULD BE A\nSIMILAR SITUATION TODAY. IT'S INTERESTING TO LOOK OUT,\nTHOUGH, HOW THE PRESIDENT HAS SPOKEN ABOUT THIS AS RECENTLY AS\nYESTERDAY. NOT SPECIFIC TO HER E-MAILS BUT\nHE SAID YES, HILLARY CLINTON -- THE WAY HE FRAMED THIS, THIS WAS\nON A RADIO SHOW, HE SAID SHE GETS A BAD RAP BUT THAT SHE HAS\nFLAWS. \"SHE'S MADE MISTAKES IN THE PAST\nJUST LIKE EVERYBODY HAS, BUT THESE ARE NOTHING\" HE SAID\n\"COMPARED TO THE DAILY ONGOING TRANSGRESSIONS MR. TRUMP ENGAGES\nIN.\" AND HE SAID \"CHEATING PEOPLE WHO\nWORK FOR HIM BY NOT PAYING THEM, HIS ATTITUDES TOWARDS WOMEN, HIS\nATTITUDES TOWARDS MINORITIES, HIS ATTITUDES TOWARDS CIVIL\nRIGHTS AND HIS ATTITUDES TOWARD MUSLIM AMERICANS.\"\nSO IT TELLS YOU A LOT ABOUT HOW HE COULD FRAME HIS RESPONSE TO\nTHE NEWS THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS IS OUT THERE AS HE'S CAMPAIGNING\nFOR HER IN FLORIDA TODAY SO HE NEEDS TO MAKE A STRONG CASE FOR\nHER AND FOR THE GOOD QUALITIES SHE HAS AND YOU KNOW HE'S GOING\nTO WANT TO HIT UPON HARDWORKING AND HONEST AND HAVING THE BEST\nOF INTENTIONS AND HE WANTS TO MAKE AS BAD A CASE AS POSSIBLE\nAGAINST DONALD TRUMP. IN FACT, HE WAS IN FLORIDA JUST\nABOUT A WEEK AGO AND THAT'S WHERE WE HEARD ONE OF HIS MOST\nENERGETIC TAKEDOWNS OF DONALD TRUMP USING WORDS LIKE \"CRAZY\"\nAND TOM SICK, ERRATIC AND DANGEROUS.\nAND THE PRESIDENT HAS SORT OF BECOME LOOSER ON THE CAMPAIGN\nTRAIL SPEAKING WHAT SEEMS TO BE MORE FROM HIS HEART, WANTING TO\nSAY WHAT'S ON HIS MIND SO IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW\nHE, WITHOUT ADDRESSING SPECIFICS RELATED TO HILLARY CLINTON'S\nE-MAILS, THAT'S LIKELY GOING TO BE THE CASE BUT HOW HE ADDRESSES\nTHE ENTIRE SITUATION THROUGH THE WORDS HE CHOOSES TO SAY, BROOKE.\n>> MICHELLE, THANK YOU. MICHELLE KOSINSKI.\nON HILLARY CLINTON, YOU'RE LOOKING AT LIVE PICTURES, SHE IS\nSPEAKING AT HER RALLY IN CEDAR RAPIDS, IOWA.\nWE HAVE A LOT OF EARS LISTENING IN.\nAS SOON AS SHE MENTIONS OR ADDRESS THIS IS BREAKING NEWS\nWE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING FROM THE FBI WE WILL TAKE IT LIVE.\nCARL BERNSTEIN, CARL BERNSTEIN IS ON THE PHONE WITH ME.\nCARL, WE HAVE BEEN TALKING FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS AND MONTHS\nABOUT THE ELECTION. YOU WROTE THE DEFINITIVE BOOK ON\nTHE CLINTONS, ON HILLARY CLINTON.\nYOU'VE BEEN SAYING THAT THIS IS THE DRIP, DRIP, DRIP THAT COULD\nULTIMATELY HAUNTER. >> WELL, THERE'S NO QUESTION\nTHAT THE E-MAILS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THE GREATEST THREAT TO HER\nCANDIDACY FOR PRESIDENT, THAT HER CONDUCT IN REGARD TO THE\nE-MAILS IS REALLY INDEFENSIBLE AND IF THERE WAS GOING TO BE\nMORE INFORMATION THAT CAME OUT, IT WAS THE ONE THING, AS I SAID\nON THE AIR LAST NIGHT, ACTUALLY THAT COULD REALLY PERHAPS AFFECT\nTHIS ELECTION. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS\nYET EXCEPT THAT IT'S A REAL BOMBSHELL.\nAND IT IS UNTHINKABLE THAT THE DIRECTOR OF THE FBI WOULD TAKE\nTHIS ACTION LIGHTLY, THAT HE WOULD PUT THIS LETTER FORTH TO\nTHE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES SAYING THERE IS MORE\nINFORMATION OUT THERE ABOUT CLASSIFIED E-MAILS AND CALL IT\nTO THE ATTENTION OF CONGRESS UNLESS IT WAS SOMETHING\nREQUIRING SERIOUS INVESTIGATION. SO THAT'S WHERE WE ARE.\nIS IT A CERTAINTY THAT WE WON'T LEARN BEFORE THE ELECTION?\nI'M NOT SURE IT'S A CERTAINTY WE WON'T LEARN BEFORE THE ELECTION.\nONE THING IS IT'S POSSIBLE THAT HILLARY CLINTON MIGHT WANT TO ON\nHER OWN THISHIVE TNITIATIVE TAL FBI AND FIND OUT WHAT SHE CAN\nAND IF SHE CHOOSES TO LET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW WHAT SHE\nTHINKS OR KNOWS IS GOING ON. PEOPLE NEED TO HEAR FROM HER.\n>> CARL, I'M SITTING HERE IN FLORIDA AND REMINDING MYSELF\nTHAT EARLY VOTING HAS LONG SINCE BEGUN AND THIS WILL BE FOR FOLKS\nPAYING ATTENTION TO THIS CAMPAIGN, FOR FOLKS WHO ARE\nEITHER UNDECIDED OR NOT THIS WILL BE A BIG EARLY VOTING\nWEEKEND HERE IN FLORIDA. WHAT CAN, WHAT SHOULD HILLARY\nCLINTON SAY TO ADDRESS THIS FOR VOTERS IN THESE KEY SWING\nSTATES? >> I THINK IF SHE HAS\nINFORMATION AVAILABLE TO HER FROM THE FBI OR ANY OTHER SOURCE\nAS TO HER KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT THESE E-MAILS MIGHT BE,\nHOPEFULLY SHE WILL LET US KNOW WHAT THEY ARE AND WHAT IS UNDER\nDISCUSSION HERE. RIGHT NOW WE'RE ALL TALKING IN A\nVACUUM BUT I WANT TO ADHERE THAT IN THE LAST, OH, 36, 48 HOURS,\nTHERE HAS BEEN AN UNDERCURRENT OF KIND OF SPECULATIVE\nDISCUSSION AMONG SOME NATIONAL SECURITY PEOPLE THAT SOMETHING\nMIGHT SURFACE IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS ABOUT E-MAILS AND I THINK\nTHE EXPECTATION IN THIS CHATTER -- AND I TOOK IT AS JUST\nCHATTER BUT INFORMED CHATTER, TO SOME EXTENT -- WAS THAT IT WOULD\nRELATE TO ANOTHER ROUND OF WIKILEAKS E-MAILS WHICH OUR\nJUSTICE DEPARTMENT PEOPLE SEEM TO BE SAYING IS NOT THE CASE,\nBUT THERE HAS BEEN SOME NOISE IN THE NATIONAL SECURITY COMMUNITY\nTHE LAST DAY OR TWO OF THIS KIND OF POSSIBILITY OF SOME KIND OF\nREVELATION. BUT THIS IS HER ACHILLES HEEL\nAND WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT IT ALSO COMES ON THE -- BACK TO THE\nWORD HEEL -- OF THE REVELATIONS ABOUT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nSO THE CONFLUENCE OF ALL OF THIS IS BAD FOR HER AS IT STANDS NOW\nBUT WITH SOME KNOWLEDGE SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO STOP, TURN\nTHINGS AROUND AND GIVE US SOME IDEA OF WHAT'S GOING NONA WAY WE\nMIGHT NOT OTHERWISE KNOW AND ALSO IT'S VERY POSSIBLE THAT\nSOME MEMBERS OF CONGRESS VERY QUICKLY ARE GOING TO GET AN IDEA\nOF WHAT THESE E-MAILS ARE AND WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT AND FOR\nWHATEVER PURPOSE PUT SOME INFORMATION OUT THERE.\n>> WE WILL SEE BECAUSE THUS FAR WE DON'T KNOW A HECK OF A LOT.\nJUST TO BE CLEAR, WE DON'T KNOW IF THESE ARE EVEN HILLARY\nCLINTON'S OWN E-MAILS IN QUESTION.\nWE JUST KNOW DIRECTOR COMEY SAID THESE ARE PERTINENT TO THE\nINVESTIGATION. CARL BERNSTEIN, THANK YOU SO\nMUCH FOR CALLING IN, ALWAYS LOVE HAVING YOUR VOICE IN THESE SORTS\nOF CONVERSATIONS.",

IN FACT, DEPUTY STATE DEPARTMENT\nSPOKESMAN MARK TONER TOLD US A SHORT TIME AGO THAT THE FIRST\nTIME THE STATE DEPARTMENT HEARD ABOUT THE FBI REOPENING THE\nINVESTIGATION IS WHEN THESE NEWS REPORTS BROKE SO WHAT THAT MEANS\nWE DON'T KNOW. DOES THAT MEAN THESE ARE NOT\nFROM THE E-MAIL TROVE THE STATE DEPARTMENT HANDED OVER?\nDOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH OTHER E-MAILS NOT RELATED TO THE STATE\nDEPARTMENT?

THAT'S PART OF THE, THE LAW, IF\nYOU WILL, LEADING UP TO AN ELECTION.\nTHIS IS PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY FOR SPEAKER RYAN TO NOW TELL THE\nINTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AEND ANY CLASSIFIED BRIEFINGS FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON BECAUSE PRESUMABLY HE SAYS SHE CAN'T BE TRUSTED.\nYOUR REACTION TO WHAT THE SPEAKER HAS JUST SAID?\n>> I'M GLAD THE SPEAKER DIDN'T JUST ACT LIKE JUDGE AND JURY AND\nULTIMATELY MAKE A HUGE DECISION ON INFORMATION THAT HE KNOWS\nABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT. HE SHOULD BE MORE CONCERNED\nABOUT WHETHER OR NOT HE'S GOING TO BE SPEAKER IN THE NEXT COUPLE\nOF MONTHS, AS OPPOSED TO BE THROWING THESE FLAMES AT HILLARY\nCLINTON. HE MADE A JUDGMENT THERE ON\nINFORMATION THAT HE DOESN'T HAVE BEFORE HIM.\nTHAT HE DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT. HE'S RENEWING A CALL THAT HE\nALREADY MADE MONTHS BEFORE THAT WAS ALREADY DISPROVEN BY\nDIRECTOR COMEY WITH THE RULING THAT HE MADE TO NOT FURTHER\nPURSUE THIS STUFF. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A BUNCH OF\nREPUBLICANS GO OUT THERE AND TRY TO MAKE POLITICAL HAY.\nBECAUSE THEY HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO TALK ABOUT, WOLF.\nIN SOME SENSE THIS IS A GIFT TO THEM, BECAUSE THEY STILL GOT TO\nLOOK IN THE MIRROR AND DEFEND DONALD TRUMP.\nAND PEOPLE AND VOTERS ARE GOING TO MAKE A JUDGMENT.\nTHESE ARE E-MAILS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE.\nTHESE ARE E-MAILS. AND SHE'S ALREADY BEEN PROVEN\nAND COMEY ALREADY SAID HE'S NOT GOING TO PURSUE THIS.\nCORRECT? SO THAT'S ALREADY BEEN SAID ON\nTHE INITIAL INVESTIGATION. THE JUDGMENT VOTERS STILL HAVE\nTO MAKE IS, DO YOU WANT DONALD TRUMP TO HAVE HIS FINGER ON THE\nNUCLEAR WEAPON? YES OR NO?\nAND REGARDLESS OF WHAT'S GOINGS ON WITH SOME E-MAIL THAT JUST\nHAS BEEN PULLED OUT OF MIDAIR, TEN DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION,\nTHE QUESTION BEFORE THE VOTERS IS --\nIS DONALD TRUMP STABLE ENOUGH TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES? AND THE ANSWER IS, NO.\nHE IS NOT STABLE ENOUGH.

TELL YOU ONE THING, REOPENING AN\nINVESTIGATION THAT WAS CLOSED INTO HILLARY CLINTON'S E-MAIL\nSERVER, NOT NECESSARILY HER PERSONAL E-MAILS BUT HER SERVER,\nIS SOMETHING THAT IS PERTINENT TO THIS ELECTION.\nAND I THINK THAT COMEY, AS YOU KNOW, HAS BEEN CRITICIZED BY\nBOTH SIDES OVER THIS MATTER, AND I THINK THAT IT MAY BE INCUMBENT\nUPON HIM TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THIS\nINVOLVES, BECAUSE OTHERWISE HE'S GOING TO BE CHARGED WITH LEADING\nA PARTISAN INVESTIGATION 11 DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION.\nSO HE IS INSERTING HIMSELF. I UNDERSTAND WHY HE WAS PROBABLY\nTRYING TO DO IT. BECAUSE I THINK THE FEELING,\nPROBABLY WAS, AND I DON'T KNOW THIS, THAT THESE THINGS LEAK OUT\nAS YOU WERE SAYING BEFORE, WOLF, AND THAT RATHER THAN HAVE THAT\nOCCUR, HE IS KIND OF A STRAIGHT SHOOTER WHO WANTED TO PUT IT OUT\nTHERE, BUT HAVING DONE THAT AND LEAVING THIS THING DANGLING\nWITHOUT KNOWING HOW SIGNIFICANT IT IS, WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT THE\nOTHER INVESTIGATION WAS, WITHOUT KNOWING ANY KIND OF SENSE OF\nWHETHER THIS IS HILLARY CLINTON'S E-MAILS OR E-MAILS\nTHAT WERE ON HER SERVER, JUST LEAVES IT DANGLING OUT THERE AND\nMAKING IT EVEN MORE OF A PARTISAN FOOTBALL THAN IT\nALREADY WAS BEFORE WITH ALL OF THESE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS.\n>> JUANA SUMMERS, CLEARLY SOMETHING THAT THE CLINTON, THAT\nTHE HILLARY CLINTON OPPONENTS, THE DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN, YOU\nJUST HEARD FROM DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF, THEY'RE WELCOMING THIS\nBIG TIME AS THEY SAY.

SUGGESTING SHE CAN'T BE TRUSTED\nWITH CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. >> RIGHT.\nHE AND OTHERS CALLED FOR THAT BEFORE AS WELL.\nWE HAVEN'T YET HEARD FROM THE WHITE HOUSE ON THIS BREAKING\nNEWS. THEY MAY NOT RESPOND UNTIL ONE\nOF THE PRESS OFFICIALS SPEAKS TO THE PRESS AS SCHEDULED LATER IN\nTHE AFTERNOON, AS PRESIDENT OBAMA IS ON HIS WAY TO STUMP FOR\nHILLARY CLINTON IN FLORIDA. IT REMINDS ME OF THE FIRST TIME\nON THE TRAIL TOGETHER. THEIR FIR APPEARANCE IN NORTH\nCAROLINA ON THE VERY DAY COMEY ANNOUNCED HIS FINDINGS THE FIRST\nTIME. NOW GOING DOWN TO FLORIDA, WHICH\nIS IT A TIGHT RACE, WANTS THAT MAKE THIS CASE AND THIS COMES\nUP. NEITHER MENTIONED IT IN THEIR\nSORT OF BIG PRESENTATION OF THE FIRST TIME ON THE TRAIL.\nINTERESTING TO SEE HOW HE ADDRESSES IT.\nWE'VE SEEN A MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE PRESIDENT OBAMA.\nHE'S LOOSER. HE SPEAKS HIS MIND MORE AND\nSAID, LOOK, YOU KNOW, AND JUST -- HE SPEAKS MUCH MORE\nCOMFORTABLY ABOUT SOME OF THE ISSUES OUT THERE.\nSO I'M CURIOUS TO SEE >> THIS ONE NOT GET BETWEEN THE\nFBI DIRECTOR AND HILLARY CLINTON.\n>> TO MAKE THE CASE IN HIS OWN WORDS \"OUR LEGAL AFFAIRS\nADVISOR. OUR ANALYST RIGHT NOW I SHOULD\nSAY. JAMES COMEY SAID IN JULY HE'S\nSUSPENDING THE INVESTIGATION. HE FOUND NO REASON TO RECOMMEND\nCRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON AL SHE HE SAID SHE ACTED\nEXTREMELY CARELESS IN HER USE OF HIS PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER.\n>> IT'S EXTRAORDINARY. WHO ARE THE ONES TO DECIDE TO\nBRING CHARGES. IT'S EXTRAORDINARY BECAUSE HE\nENTERED INTO THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION VARIOUS FACTS THAT NEVER\nWOULD HAVE COME OUT UNLESS THEY WERE LEAKED SO HIS CHOICE TO SAY\nTHE WORDS \"CARELESS\" ET CETERA SHOWS YOU THERE WAS AN ACT ON\nHIS PART IN AN EFFORT TO BE TRANSPARENT THAT HAS COME TO\nHAUNT HILLARY CLINTON. HE IS NOT REOPENING THE\nINVESTIGATION INTO THE E-MAIL SERVER, HIS STATEMENT IS HE'S\nTRYING TO WHETHER NEW E-MAILS CAME TO LIGHT OR WHETHER SHE\nINTENDED TO THWART THE LAW IS AND TRIED TO USE THE E-MAIL\nSERVER, ET CETERA, OR USE HER E-MAILS THAT ALLOWS CLASSIFIED\nDATA TO BE EXPOSED. GLORIA IS CORRECT.\nWE DON'T HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT LOOKS LIKE.\nALTHOUGH LEGALLY SPEAKING IT'S NOT SO SHOCKING WE DON'T HAVE\nCONCLUSIONS. OPTICALLY IN POLITICS THIS IS AN\nEXTRAORDINARY MEASURE AND CAN BE BLAMED ON COMEY'S DECISION TO\nPROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION WHERE NOBODY\nELSE WOULD. >> OUR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT\nEVAN PEREZ QUOTING LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCES SAYING THESE\nNEWLY DISCOVERED E-MAILS THAT THE FBI NOW HAS POSSESSION OF\nARE NOT RELATED TO THE WIKILEAKS MATTER OR THE CLINTON FOUNDATION\nALTHOUGH THE SOURCES WILL NOT DESCRIBE IN FURTHER DETAIL THE\nCONTENT OF THE E-MAILS. I WANT TO BRING IN JASON MILLER\nRIGHT NOW, THE SENIOR COMMUNICATIONS ADVISOR TO THE\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN JOINING US FROM NEW YORK.\nJASON, THANKS VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US.\n>> WOLF, THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME ON.\n>> YOU HEARD YOUR BOSS DONALD TRUMP.\nHE'S OBVIOUSLY GLEEFUL, BUT WHAT IF ANYTHING ELSE DO YOU KNOW\nABOUT THIS THAT IS BEING MADE PUBLIC BY THE FBI DIRECTOR\nHIMSELF. >> WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT THIS THE\nSAME TIME THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IS BUT THIS IS TRULY, TRULY\nREMARKABLE DEVELOPMENT. THIS CLOSE TO THE ELECTION TO BE\nREOPENING THE INVESTIGATION MEANS WHATEVER IT IS THEY FOUND\nTO BE VERY SIGNIFICANT. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS, WE\nSEE THAT THE FBI WILL MAKE THAT AVAILABLE BEFORE THE ELECTION.\nTHAT WILL BE SOMETHING THAT COMES FORWARD SO THE AMERICAN\nPEOPLE CAN MAKE A DECISION BUT THIS HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT\nWE'VE TALKED ABOUT A LOT WITH THE ABSOLUTE VIOLATION OF TRUST\nOF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE OF NOT ONLY EXPOSING THIS CONFIDANTE\nSHL AND CLASSIFIED INFORMATION BUT THEN ALSO THE COVERUP AND\nTRYING TO KEEP IT QUIET SO THAT THESE ARE THINGS WE THINK VOTERS\nNEED TO KNOW ABOUT BEFORE ELECTION DAY.\n>> THE FBI DIRECTOR SAYS HE CAN NOT PREDICT HOW LONG IT WILL\nTAKE TO COMPLETE THIS WORK. MY SUSPICION IS HE WON'T RELEASE\nMORE INFORMATION BETWEEN NOW AND THE ELECTION THAT IS ONLY 11\nDAYS AWAY BUT THERE PROBABLY WILL BE SERIOUS LEAKING GOING\nON. IN WASHINGTON PEOPLE TALK AND\nGET THIS INFORMATION BUT YOU PRESUMABLY SEE THIS AS A MOM\nWITH -- BOMBSHELL HAS HELPING CONVINCE UNDECIDED VOTERS TO NOT\nVOTE FOR HILLARY CLINTON BUT TO VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nI ASSUME THAT'S THE WAY YOU SEE THIS.\n>> THIS GOES TO WHAT MR. TRUMP SAYING ALL ALONG, THAT THERE ARE\nREAL PROBLEMS HERE, THIS IS SOMEONE WHO PUT CONFIDANTE SHL\nINFORMATION OUT THERE IN A COMPLETELY UNSECURE SERVER.\nTHIS IS A VIOLATION OF THE TRUST.\nTHAT THIS WAS SET UP SPECIFICALLY TO GET AROUND LAWS\nAND SYSTEMS IN PLACE. WOLF, THINK ABOUT IT.\nFIVE DIFFERENT PEOPLE TOOK THE FIFTY IN THE INVESTIGATION INTO\nTHIS. THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN IF NO CRIMES\nWERE COMMITTED OR IF LAWS HADN'T BEEN BROKEN.\nSOMETHING STINKS HERE AND I'M GLAD THE FBI IS GOING TO GET TO\nTHE BOTTOM OF IT. >> JASON MILLER, THANKS FOR\nJOINING US.",

COMEY, THE HEAD OF THE FBI AND I THINK THAT IF THERE WERE\nCERTAIN THINGS THAT HE BELIEVED WERE PERTINENT TO THE\nINVESTIGATION, HIS WORDS, NOT MINE, THAT MAY POTENTIALLY BE\nSIGNIFICANT, I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE MEAT ON\nTHOSE BONES BECAUSE OTHERWISE HE'S PUT HIMSELF DIRECTLY IN THE\nMIDDLE OF A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN. 11 DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION.\n>> IT'S POSSIBLE, JUANA, TOO, THAT HE GOT WORD THAT FBI\nOFFICIALS, OTHERS IN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, LEARNED OF THESE\nNEWLY DISCOVERED E-MAILS FROM AN UNRELATED CASE AND HE FEARED\nTHEY COULD LEAK THIS INFORMATION.\nTHAT'S WHEN HE MADE THE DECISION TO GO AHEAD AND INFORM MEMBERS\nOF CONGRESS HE WAS REOPENING IT. >> THAT'S RIGHT, WOLF.\nTHAT'S ONE OF MY BIGGEST QUESTIONS UPON HEARING THIS NEWS\nIS WHAT UNRELATED INVESTIGATION? WE DON'T HAVE INFORMATION.\nWE HEARD FROM EVAN PEREZ THAT THIS ISN'T RELATED TO WIKILEAKS\nOR THE CLINTON FOUNDATION. WHAT IS RELATED AND HOW DO WE\nGET TO THIS POINT. IN THE CONDEMNATION THE WAY MR.\nCOMEY MADE IN HANDING THE E-MAILS, THAT'S WHAT I'M CURIOUS\nABOUT. >> FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY\nINFORMS CONGRESS AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN A FORMAL\nSTATEMENT THAT HE'S REOPENING THE INVESTIGATION INTO HILLARY\nCLINTON'S USE OF THE PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER AFTER DISCOVERING\nSOME NEW E-MAILS IN AN UNRELATED CASE.\nTHIS IS A MAJOR DEVELOPMENT ONLY DAYS BEFORE -- 11 DAYS BEFORE\nTHE ELECTION. OUR SPECIAL COVERAGE WILL\nCONTINUE WITH BROOKE BALDWIN RIGHT NOW.",

      "text": "REPORTED THAT DONALD TRUMP HAD\nONLY SPENT SOME $30,000 ON HIS CAMPAIGN, AND THE FIRST THREE\nWEEKS OF OCTOBER, AND THAT HE IS ABOUT $44 MILLION SHORT OF HIS\nSTATED GOAL OF CHIPPING IN $100 MILLION TO HIS CAMPAIGN.\nEVEN A $10 MILLION CHECK, WOLF, WON'T GET HIM VERY CLOSE TO THE\n$100 MILLION TOTAL AND I THINK THE SCHEDULE TODAY ALSO SAYS A\nLOT. HE'S HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE WHERE\nHE FACES AN UPHILL BATTLE AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON.\nREPUBLICANS ARE IN A VERY TOUGH RE-ELECTION FIGHT WHEN IT COMES\nTO HOLDING ON TO THE SENATE SEAT KELLY AYOTTE HOLDS IN THE SENATE\nCURRENTLY. JOHN SUNUNU, FORMER GOVERNOR OF\nHIS STATE, BUT A LONGTIME REPUBLICAN VOICE OF THE STATE,\nWAS JUST UP ONSTAGE BEHIND ME AND REALLY SORT OF TWISTING\nELBOWS IN THIS ROOM. SAYING TO REPUBLICANS, IN THE\nSTATE, I KNOW SOME ARE RELUCTANT TO SUPPORT THIS NOMINEE.\nI KNOW SOME ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HIS RHETORIC BUT WE NEED YOU TO\nGET TO THE POLLS AND REMEMBER WHO HE'S RUNNING AGAIN.\nTHAT IS HILLARY CLINTON. SO INTERESTING CANDOR COMING\nFROM JOHN SUNUNU, A BIT OF AN UPHILL CLIMB AND HEADS OFF TO\nMAINE AFTER THIS. IN MAIN LETT ERMAINE LATER ON T\nAFTERNOON. THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN SAYS WE WOULD\nLIKE TO PEEL AWAY A VOTE IN MAINE TO GET CLOSER TO 270.\nIF YOU WIN A CONGRESSIONAL VOTE IN THAT SPLIT ELECTORAL SYSTEM\nYOU CAN GET AN ELECTORAL VOTE SHOWING YOU INSIDE THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN THEY KNOW THAT IS A VERY NARROW ELECTORAL PATH TO\nGET TO 270 ELECTORAL VOTES AND, YES, WORTH INVESTING THIS TIME\nTHIS LATE IN THE CAMPAIGN TO GO UP TO MAINE AND PURSUIT OF AN\nELECTORAL VOTE AND IOWA, HOLDING A SOLID LEAD.\nLATEST POLLS COMING IN, P.I. POLL AND OTHERS, SHOWS IT'S\nTIGHTENING THERE. AS DAYS ARE GETTING SHORTER, THE\nPRESSURE IS GETTING GREATER ON THIS CAMPAIGN TO TRY TO FIND\nTHAT PATH TO 270. MY GUESS IS, WOLF, WE'RE GOING\nTO HEAR THE SAME OLD DONALD TRUMP WE'VE BEEN HEARING OVER\nTHE LAST SEVERAL DAYS TOSSING OUT RED MEAT TO CROWDS.\nLAST NIGHT JOKED PERHAPS CANCEL THE ELECTION AND DECLARE DONALD\nTRUMP THE WINNER. HE IS KEEPING HIS SENSE OF HUMOR\nTHROUGH ALL OF THIS, BUT EXPECT THESE ATTACKS ON HILLARY CLINTON\nON OBAMA CARE, THAT SORT OF THING TO BE STEPPED UP HERE WHEN\nHE WALKS OUT. WE'RE HEARING HE'LL BE HERE\nSHORTLY. HOPEFULLY IN JUST A FEW MOMENTS,\nWOMAN. >> WE'LL STAND BY TO HEAR WHAT\nDONALD TRUMP HAS TO SAY TODAY. JIM ACOSTA, BACK TO YOU.\nHILLARY CLINTON LED EVERY SINGLE POLL OUT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE SINCE\nMAY, BUT WITH TRUMP STOPPING THERE SOON, WILL IT BE ENOUGH TO\nCHANGE THAT? LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT WITH OUR\nPANEL. WANNA SU\nWANNA -- JUANA SUMMERS AND GLORIA BORGER, CHIEF POLITICAL\nANALYST AND BRIANNA KEILAR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT.\nGLORIA, WHAT MESSAGE DOES TRUMP NEED TO SHARE WITH VOTERS IN NEW\nHAMPSHIRE RIGHT NOW? >> LOOK, I THINK HE NEEDS TO\nSTICK ON HIS MESSAGE. WHICH HE'S ACTUALLY BEEN DOING\nMORE THAN WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST.\nTHESE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS. HE'S GOT TO TALK ABOUT HILLARY\nCLINTON, WIKILEAKS, DRAINING THE SWAMP IN WASHINGTON, WHICH IS A\nMESSAGE THAT'S VERY RESONANT FOR HIM, THAT SHE IS THE STATUS QUO.\nTHAT HE REPRESENTS CHANGE, AND THAT, THAT IF YOU ELECT HILLARY\nCLINTON IT'S GOING TO BE MORE OF THE SAME.\nI THINK THESE HE'S GOING TO BE -- GOING TO BE TALKING UP\nWIKILEAKS, AND CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATIONS AND CONTINUING\nALONG THAT LINE. IF HE REVERTS BACK AND STARTS\nTALKING ABOUT HOW HE'S GOING TO SUE NBC FOR THE \"ACCESS\nHOLLYWOOD\" TAPE OR HOW HE'S GOING TO SUE THESE WOMEN WHO\nHAVE COME OUT AND ACCUSED HIM OF GROPING THEM, ET CETERA, THEN I\nTHINK HE'S TOTALLY GOING OFF THE RAILS AGAIN.\n>> JUANA, A LOT PEOPLE WONDER WHY ELECTORAL -- FOUR IS A SMALL\nNUMBER. IT WENT FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA BOTH\nIN 2008 AND 2012. AND ALL OF THE POLLS SINCE JUNE\nOR MAY HAVE BEEN SHOWING THAT DONALD TRUMP IS LOSING IN NEW\nHAMPSHIRE. SO WHY IS HE GOING THERE WITH\nONLY 11 DAYS TO GO? >> WOLF, YOU'RE RIGHT.\nA COUPLE DIFFERENT REASONS WHY THIS IS A STATE DONALD TRUMP\nCOULD PERHAPS DO WELL AND CLOSE IN THE MARGIN IF NOT WIN.\nFIRST OF ALL, LOOKING AT THIS FROM A SENTIMENTALITY ARGUMENT.\nTHE STATE THAT GAVE HIM HIS FIRST POLITICAL VICTORY.\nWON THAT PRETTY WELL AND THE STATE IS A STATE WITH OUT OF\nINDEPENDENT VOTERS TO SWAY. LOOK BACK TO 2012, INDEPENDENTS\nWERE ABOUT 40% OF VOTE IN THE 2011 AND BARACK OBAMA WON ABOUT\nFIVE PERCENTAGE POINTS. IT'S A SMALL STATE AND\nDEMOGRAPHICS THAT FAVORS DEMOCRATIC-MINDED CANDIDATES.\nI SEE AN OPENING IN THE DAYS AHEAD OF THE ELECTION PERHAPS\nDONALD TRUMP COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE THERE IF HE DOES WHAT\nGLORIA SAYS, STICKS TO THE SCRIPT, FOCUSING ON WHAT VOTERS\nCARE ABOUT INSTEAD OF THE EXTRANEOUS COMMENTS HE TENDS TO\nMAKE ON THE ROAD. >> HOLDS THESE RAILS, 10,000,\n20,000, 30,000 PEOPLE SHOW UP. IMPRESSIVE LONG LINES BUT\nREPORTERS HAVEN'T SEEN A LOT OF REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE\nSTAFFERS THERE AND OTHERS TO HELP THEM GET THE VOTE OUT,\nENCOURAGE THESE PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY NOT JUST SHOW UP AT A\nRALLY BUT GO AND VOTE. THIS IS A MISSED OPPORTUNITY,\nPOTENTIALLY? >> IT'S A SHAME FOR THEM AND TO\nGIVE PEOPLE A PERSPECTIVE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO GO TO A HILLARY\nCLINTON RALLY, I WALK IN AS A MEMBER OF MEDIA AND ASKED AT\nLEAST FIVE TIMES COMING AND GOING IF I AM REGISTERED TO\nVOTE. I SAY I'M HERE WITH THE MEDIA.\nOKAY. I GO ON MY WAY.\nBUT I'M ASKED OVER AND OVER. THAT'S THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT\nTHEY'RE DEALING WITH, AND IT JUST -- IT ISN'T ENOUGH TO HAVE\nENTHUSIASM. THERE'S THAT SAYING YOU CAN LEAD\nA HORSE TO WATER. YOU CAN'T MAKE HIM DRINK.\nHE'S MORE LIKELY TO DRINK IF YOU DO LEAD HIM TO WATER.\nYOU SGKNOW? THAT'S WHAT GETTING PEOPLE\nREGISTERED TO VOTE TO PLEDGE TO VOTE FOR HILLARY CLINTON OR\nDONALD TRUMP THEY'LL BENEFIT FROM.\nREPORTS OUT OF OHIO IN SOUTHERN AND EASTERN OHIO WILL DONALD\nTRUMP DID WELL IN PRIMARIES, VOTER REGISTRATION IS LAGGING.\nIT'S CRAZY IT'S -- NOT CRAZY BUT SORT OF IT MIGHT, YOU KNOW, PUT\nA HOLE IN HIS HERE TO THEY ENTHUSIASM IS ENOUGH JUST TO GET\nPEOPLE TO DO THIS ALL ON THEIR OWN.\n>> I REMEMBER TALKING TO FOLKS NOT TOO LONG AGO DOING SOMETHING\nABOUT MONDALE, AND WALTER MONDALE WHO RAN FOR THE\nPRESIDENCY, AND I WAS TOLD BY ONE OF HIS FORMER AIDES, WE HAD\nTHE LAST WEEK OF THE CAMPAIGN 30,000 PEOPLE AT OUR RALLIES,\nAND YOU'LL RECALL A LOSS OF -- DIDN'T GO WELL.\n>> GETTING EARLY INSIGHT INTO SOME OF THE EARLY VOTING IN\nIOWA, FOR EXAMPLE. QUINNIPIAC UNIVERSITY POLL\nSHOWING THAT 61% OF THE EARLY VOTERS IN IOWA HAVE CAST THEIR\nBALLOTS FOR HILLARY CLINTON. SO IS THIS A SIGN THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON IS JUST GETTING A LOT OF EARLY VOTES OUT THERE?\nOR IS THERE A TREND? SOMETHING GOING ON IN IOWA THAT\nMAYBE COULD BE SIGNIFICANT? >> WELL I DO THINK IT'S\nSIGNIFICANT A LOT OF THE EARLY VOTING SEEMS TO BE FAVORING\nCLINTON IN SOME OF THESE STATES. YOU SEE THAT IN NORTH CAROLINA\nAS WELL. BECAUSE ITS ENTHUSIASM, TURNOUT,\nALSO TAKING ATTENTION AWAY FROM THE CLOSE OF THE CAMPAIGN AND\nSHOWING AT THE TIME WHEN SHE WAS SURGING AHEAD OF TRUMP, SHE'S\nABLE TO CAPITALIZE THAT AND GET VOTERS TO THE POLL.\nENTHUSIASM AND SIMPLY WINNING. EARLIER THAN ELECTION DAY.\nI THINK THAT MATTERS. I THINK THAT DONALD TRUMP IS\nACTUALLY FAILING IN THIS RESPECT RIGHT NOW.\nLOOK, IF HE'S TIGHT AND CLOSE TO WINNING IN FLORIDA AND OHIO HE'S\nGOT TO BE FOCUSED ON THOSE. GET THOSE REPUBLICANS TO COME\nHOME. HE'S GOT TO SOUND AS MUCH LIKE A\nCONVENTIONAL AL REPUBLICAN AS POSSIBLE.\nHIS HARD-CORE RADICAL CHANGE IS A SUPPORTERS ARE BEHIND HIM.\nWRE WE KNOW THIS. HE NEEDS OTHERS.\nI CANNOT STAND HILLARY CLINTON. HE'S A REPUBLICAN AND I'M GOING\nTO SHOW UP AND VOTE FOR HIM, THEN HE HE HAS A CHANCE.\nSO MUCH WE CAN'T SEE. EARLY VOTING, LOOK BACK SAY\nTHAT'S WHEN HILLARY CLINTON REALLY CRUSHED HIM.\n>> PEOPLE MADE UP THEIR MINDS EASILY, TEND TO VOTE EARLY.\nAND SO YOU SEE THAT AMONG DEMOCRATS IN A LOT OF STATES,\nWHICH IS, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP NO MATTER\nWHAT. THE QUESTION IS, AS WE CONTINUE\nTHOSE LITTLE BIT OF WE ARE SUEDABLES, I'M NOT QUITE SURE\nHOW MANY OF LEFT, THEY'RE NOT VOTING EARLY.\nRIGHT? THEY'RE STILL THINKING WHAT\nTHEY'RE GOING TO DO, AN YOU WOULD RATHER VOTE AFTER THE\nDEBATES. >> OF COURSE.\n>> AND WHICH HE'S IN THE MIDDLE OF NOW BETWEEN WIKILEAKS,\nFOUNDATION QUESTIONS ABOUT HER HUSBAND AN SO FORTH.\n>> THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS A BETTER\nGROUND GAME ALL OVER THE COUNTRY IN THESE BATTLEGROUND STATES.\nAND A LOT MORE MONEY RIGHT NOW, WHICH WILL BE TRANSLATED\nPOTENTIALLY INTO VOTES? >> ABSOLUTELY.\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN RELY AND THE RNC FOR ON THE GROUND OPERATION\nHAVEN'T MOUNTED THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE SEE FROM A\nK CANDIDATE ON EITHER SIDE OF THE\nAISLE. THE MONEY RACE IS HUGE.\nHILLARY CLINTON OUT RAISED DONALD TRUMP IN THE FIRST THREE\nWEEKS OF OCTOBER. DOUBLED WHAT HE RAISED.\nCASH ON HAND, A TREMENDOUS ADVANTAGE.\nDONALD TRUMP FUELED ANOTHER $10 MILLION INTO HIS OWN CAMPAIGN\nGETTING HIM INTO THE $60 MILLION OUT OF THE $100 MILLION PLEDGED\nTO SPEND. LATE MONEY.\nMOST OF THE AIRWAVE TIME IS GOING BETWEEN THE CAMPAIGNS AND\nSUPER PACS. NOT A LOT TO DO THERE YET.\n>> BREAKING NEWS. I WANT TO BRING TO OUR VIEWERS\nRIGHT NOW, A NEW POSSIBLE INVESTIGATION BY THE FBI INTO\nHILLARY CLINTON'S E-MAILS. OUR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT EVAN\nPEREZ JOINS US WITH DETAILS. WHAT ARE YOU LEVING, EVAN?\n>> Reporter: WOLF THE FBI DIRECTOR JIM COMEY SENT A LETTER\nTO CONGRESS SAYING THE FBI IS TAKING A LOOK AT ANOTHER SET OF\nE-MAILS IT HADN'T PREVIOUSLY TAKE AN LOOK AT WHILE DOING ITS\nINVESTIGATION. YOU REMEMBER BACK IN JULY THE\nDIRECTOR OF THE FBI ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WERE RECOMMENDING NO\nCHARGES BE BROUGHT AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON IN THAT\nINVESTIGATION. HER USE OF A PRIVATE SERVER\nWHILE SECRETARY OF STATE DURING HER TENURE AS SECRETARY OF\nSTATE. THIS LETTER THAT COMEY HAS NOW\nSENT TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS SAYS THAT NEW E-MAILS HAVE NOW COME\nTO THE ATTENTION OF THE INVESTIGATIVE TEAM.\nTHIS IS A TEAM OF INVESTIGATORS IN THE COUNTERINTELLIGENCE\nDIVISION AT THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE FBI AND ARE NOW GOING TO\nTAKE A LOOK AT THESE E-MAILS. NOW, WE'RE TOLD THAT THE\nINVESTIGATORS ARE FNOW GOING TO SEE TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THESE\nADDITIONAL E-MAILS UNCOVERED CONTAIN CLASSIFIED INFORMATION\nAS WELL AS WHETHER TO ASSESS THEIR IMPORTANCE TO THIS\nINVESTIGATION, WOLF. THIS MEANS THAT THE\nINVESTIGATION WHICH WE THOUGHT WAS OVER WITH IS NOW BACK OPEN\nAND THE FBI IS TAKING ANOTHER LOOK TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT\nTHERE'S SOMETHING HERE FOR THEM TO PURSUE.\nOBVIOUSLY, THIS IS WHAT REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN CALLING\nFOR BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT THE INVESTIGATION WAS NOT DONE\nEXACTLY ACCORDING TO THE PROCEDURES THAT THE FBI USUALLY\nUSES IN THESE TYPES OF INVESTIGATIONS.\nSO NOW THIS IS ANOTHER WORRY FOR THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN AS WE COME\nTO THE CLOSING DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION.\nWOLF? >> SO BASICALLY I HEAR YOU\nSAYING, EVAN, THIS IS A LETTER FROM COMEY, THE FBI DIRECTOR, TO\nMEMBERS OF CONGRESS. HAS HILLARY CLINTON AND HER\nATTORNEYS, HAVE THEY BEEN SEPARATELY NOTIFIED ABOUT THIS\nPOTENTIAL NEW INVESTIGATION? >> Reporter: WE HAVEN'T HEARD\nYET FROM THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN WHETHER OR NOT THEY'VE BEEN\nNOTIFIED. THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE TRYING TO\nCHECK RIGHT NOW, WOLF. WE DO KNOW THAT THE FACT THAT\nTHE -- THE DIRECTOR OF THE FBI IS TELLING THIS TO MEMBERS OF\nCONGRESS, HE'S SIMPLY TRYING TO INFORM THEM BECAUSE HE TESTIFIED\nA NUMBER OF TIMES ALREADY IN CONGRESS THAT THIS INVESTIGATION\nWAS DONE PROPERLY. HE BELIEVES THAT THE FBI DID\nEVERYTHING IT COULD TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S WERE\nCHARGES APPROPRIATE IN THIS CASE AND THEY DECIDED THAT IT WAS\nNOT. THESE NEW E-MAILS THEY'VE\nUNCOVERED, HOWEVER, SEEMS TO INDICATE THERE'S MORE HERE FOR\nTHE FBI TO TAKE A LOOK AT, EXACTLY WHAT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS\nHAVE BEEN CALLING FOR AND, AGAIN, WHY HE SENT THIS LETTER.\nWE HAVE NOT YET HEARD FROM THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN WHETHER OR NOT\nTHIS MEANS NING TO THEM. AN IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT DAYS\nBEFORE THIS ELECTION. >> WE HAVE A PART OF THAT\nSTATEMENT FROM THE FBI DIRECTOR, JAMES COMEY.\nPUT IT UP ON THE SCREEN IF WE CAN.\nAMONG OTHER THINGS, HE WRITES THIS --\nIN CONNECTION WITH AN UNRELATED CASE, THE FBI HAS LEARNED OF THE\nEXISTENCE OF E-MAILS THAT APPEAR TO BE PERTINENT TO THE\nINVESTIGATION. I AGREED THAT THE FBI SHOULD\nTAKE APPROPRIATE INVESTIGATIVE STEPS DESIGNED TO ALLOW\nINVESTIGATORS TO REVIEW THOSE E-MAILS TO DETERMINE WHETHER\nTHEY CONTAIN CLASSIFIED INFORMATION AS WELL AS TO ASSESS\nTHEIR IMPORTANCE TO OUR INVESTIGATION.\nSO THIS STATEMENT FROM THE FBI DIRECTOR, EVAN SAYS THAT THEY\nWERE WORKING ON OTHER UNREPRESENTED CASES AND ALL OF A\nSUDDEN CAME UPON SOME HILLARY CLINTON-REPRESENTED E-MAILS THAT\nMAY HAVE CONTAINED CLASSIFIED INFORMATION, AND NOW THAT'S WHY\nTHEY'RE REOPENING THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE HILLARY\nCLINTON E-MAIL ISSUE? >> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT, WOLF.\nTHAT'S RIGHT. GOING TO LOOK AT THESE E-MAILS\nAND ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE IS WHAT EXACTLY\nWHAT INVESTIGATION THAT IS? WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT THAT\nINVESTIGATION THAT UNRELATED INVESTIGATION.\nWE'RE TOLD BY SOURCES THAT WE'VE TALKED TO THAT IT DOES NOT\nRELATE TO THE ONGOING WIKILEAKS INVESTIGATION.\nAS YOU KNOW, THOSE WIKILEAKS E-MAILS, THOSE E-MAILS HACKED BY\nTHE RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICES ACCORDING TO U.S.\nINTELLIGENCE, AND HAVE NOW BEEN RELEASED BY WIKILEAKS RAISED NEW\nQUESTIONS ABOUT CLINTON AND HER CONDUCT THERE DURING THE --\nDURING HER TENURE AS SECRETARY OF STATE AS WELL AS DURING HER\nCAMPAIGN HERE. SO THE QUESTION HAS BEEN WHETHER\nOR NOT THIS IS SOMETHING THE FBI SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT.\nWE'RE TOLD THIS IS NOT RELATED TO THE WIKILEAKS INVESTIGATION.\nIT'S ALSO NOT RELATED TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, WHICH AS YOU\nKNOW, WOLF, THE FBI HAS TAKEN A LOOK AT IN THE PAST.\nTHAT INVESTIGATION IS STILL SOMETHING THAT IS, IN THE\nBACKGROUND OF ALL OF THIS. >> WE KNOW FBI INVESTIGATIONS\nTAKE A WHILE. QUICKLY, EVAN, I SUSPECT NOTHING\nIS GOING TO EMERGE UNLESS THERE ARE LEAKS AND PRESUMABLY THERE\nCOULD BE OVER THE NEXT 11 DAYS OR SO BEFORE THE U.S. ELECTION.\nRIGHT? >> Reporter: RIGHT.\nTHE FBI DIRECTOR SAYS HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW LONG THIS IS GOING TO\nTAKE. I ANTICIPATE, WOLF, THAT WE'RE\nNOT GOING TO KNOW THE ANSWER UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION.\n>> EVAN PEREZ, OUR JUSTICE KE\nCORRESPONDENT. BACK TO THE PANEL.\nGLORIA, POTENTIALLY ANOTHER WORRISOME DEVELOPMENT FOR THE\nHILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN. THE TIMING, RATHER AWKWARD.\n>> I'D SAY SO, AND WE WERE JUST TALKING EARLIER WHAT DONALD\nTRUMP SHOULD TALK ABOUT TODAY. I THINK THIS.\nWHILE THIS LETTER DOES SAY, WOULD OF, FROM COMEY WE CANNOT\nASSESS WEHETHER THIS MATERIAL MY BE SIGNIFICANT AND I ALSO CAN'T\nSAY HOW LONG IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO COMPLETE, IT'S VERY CLEAR\nTHAT IT IS SIGNIFICANT POLITICALLY.\nTHAT -- THAT DONALD TRUMP CAN SAY MORE OF THE SAME.\nTHEY HAVE REOPENED AN INVESTIGATION THAT THEY CLOSED\nOR SO THEY THOUGHT, IN JULY LAST SUMMER, AND HE CAN GO TO THE, TO\nTHE CORRUPTION ANGLE WITH HILLARY CLINTON.\nI MEAN, WE -- YOU KNOW, AS EVAN WAS JUST SAYING, THERE'S MORE WE\nDON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS THAN WE KNOW.\nTHEY'VE COME ACROSS SOMETHING THAT MAY POTENTIALLY BE\nSIGNIFICANT, BUT THEY HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA.\nPUTS HILLARY CLINTON IN A VERY DIFFICULT SPOT.\nWITH THE WIKILEAKS HACK, THEY CAN JUST NOT ANSWER QUESTIONS\nAND SAY, OH, THAT'S THE RESULT OF THE RUSSIAN, AND THEY'RE NOT\nANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT.\nTHIS, I THINK THEY DO HAVE TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS, AND CAN'T\nJUST PUSH IT ASIDE, AND IF I WERE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, THIS IS\nWHAT I WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY.\n>> BRIANNA, YOU AND I, ALL OF US, KNOW HOW WASHINGTON WORKS.\nIF THERE'S SOMETHING THERE, IT'S GOING TO LEAK, COME OUT QUICKLY\nAND THAT'S GOING TO BE A PROBLEM POTENTIALLY FOR THE HILLARY\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN. >> CERTAINLY IS.\nEVEN THE IDEA THAT THIS IS BEING LOOKED AT AGAIN IS SOMETHING\nTHAT IS DAMAGING. YOU REMEMBER HILLARY CLINTON\nSAID THAT BASICALLY WHAT SHE SAID WAS FBI DIRECTOR COMEY SAID\nI DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG. I'M PARAPHRASING.\nTHAT'S NOT WHAT HE SAID. WHAT HE SAID WAS SHE AND HER\nAIDES WERE RECKLESS IN THE HANDLING OF E-MAILS AND ON THIS\nSERVER, BUT EVEN NOW SHE CERTAINLY FEELS LIKE SHE DIDN'T\nDO ANYTHING WRONG. BUT IT'S NOT REALLY AN ARGUMENT,\nSHE CAN'T GO AS FAR AS BEFORE. YOU KNOW?\nNOW IT'S UP IN THE AIR. IT'S -- IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS\nYOU HEAR THEM SAY IS SORT OF THAT'S OVER AND DONE WITH.\nWE'VE MOVED ON. RIGHT?\nTHAT'S BEEN PUT TO BED. YOU CAN'T SAY THAT.\n>> NOW INVESTIGATING AGAIN AND SAYS AT THE END OF HIS LETTER,\nDAVID, ALTHOUGH THE FBI CANNOT YET ASSESS WHETHER OR NOT THIS\nMATERIAL MAY BE SIGNIFICANT AND I CANNOT PREDICT HOW LONG IT\nWILL TAKE US TO COMPLETE THIS ADDITIONAL WORK I BELIEVE IT IS\nIMPORTANT TO UPDATE YOUR COMMITTEES ABOUT OUR EFFORTS IN\nLIGHT OF MY PREVIOUS TESTIMONY. THAT SORT OF SOUNDS A BIT\nOMINOUS. >> WELL, WE'LL SEE WHAT IT IS.\nI MEAN, WHAT I THINK IS STRIKING IS, THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT\nTHERE'S POLITICAL FALLOUT FROM THIS, BECAUSE IT'S STILL A\nPOLITICAL FOOTBALL. WHAT IS ALSO STRIKING IS THE\nEXTENT TO WHICH THE FBI DIRECTOR OF THE UNITED STATES IS ALLOWING\nHIMSELF TO BE INTERJECTED INTO THIS POLITICAL CAMPAIGN.\nUNPRECEDENTED THAT HE WOULD HAVE RELEASED THE INFORMATION HE\nRELEASED AFTER A DECISION NOT TO RECOMMEND INDICTMENT.\nYOU JUST DON'T SEE THAT DONE EVER, AND NOW HE IS VERY\nPUBLICLY EXCHANGES INFORMATION WITH COMMITTEES BENT ON KEEPING\nTHESE INVESTIGATIONS ALIVE, AND ALSO STRIKING, THE SILENCE OF\nTHE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES WHO HAS RENDERED A\nJUDGMENT FLOT TO PER SUE ANYTHING CRIMINAL.\nTHE POLITICIZATION OF THESE TWO ROLES WILL EXTEND FAR PAST --\n>> HE'S COME UNDER ENORMOUS CRITICISM FROM REPUBLICANS.\n>> HE HAS, WHO FELT THE CLINTON WERE ESSENTIALLY A CRIMINAL\nENTERPRISE AND FBI AGENTS WHO LEAK THIS INFORMATION, WANT\nHILLARY CLINTON CHARGED WITH A CRIME.\nHAS SAID NOBODY WOULD HAVE BROUGHT SUCH A CLOSE.\nNOT EVE AN CLOSE CALL AND TRYING TO RELEASE THAT INFORMATION TO\nQUIET DOWN CRITICS AGAINST THE FBI AND THEN THE FIX WAS IN.\nYOU'RE IN THE TANK FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nSO HE'S NOT LOOKING GOOD ANYWAY. YOU STRIKE IT, BUT HE CONTINUES\nTO PUT MORE INFORMATION OUT, CLOSE TO THE ELECTION.\n>> AND AT THE SAME TIME HE CLEARED HER THIS PAST SUMMER HE\nSAID HER HANDLING OF E-MAILS WAS RECKLESS.\nHE MADE AN EDITORIAL JUDGMENT. >> RIGHT.\n>> EVEN THOUGH HE DIDN'T PROSECUTE.\nKIND OF STUCK. >> WHICH WAS NEVER DONE.\n>> HE SAYS EXTREMELY RECKLESS. >> HE DID.\nA STATEMENT MADE FROM HIM DECIDING NOT TO MAKE THE CHARGE.\nBIGGEST THING THAT STICKS OUT A CANDIDATE YOU CAN'T DRAW A\nDIRECT LINE TO THE E-MAILS BUT SEE IN POLL AFTER POLL AFTER\nPOLL PEOPLE HAVE DEEP CONCERNS ACROSS AMERICA AND ACROSS\nDEMOCRAT GRAPHICS ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S HONESTY AND\nTRUSTWORTHINESS AND SOME POLLS PEOPLE SAY DONALD TRUMP IS MORE\nHON EFFORT AND TRUSTWORTHY. FROM THAT STANDPOINT, THIS\nREVERSE THEAL AND MAY BE AN OPE QUESTION IS NOT GOOD FOR HER\nCAMPAIGN.

CONGRESSMAN, THANKS VERY MUCH\nFOR JOINING US. >> GREAT TO BE WITH YOU, WOLF.\n>> THIS IS SORT OF A BOMBSHELL RIGHT NOW COMING AT THE END OF\nOCTOBER. ONLY 11 DAYS BEFORE THE\nELECTION, THAT THE FBI DIRECTOR HAS DECIDED TO REOPEN THE\nINVESTIGATION INTO THE HILLARY CLINTON E-MAIL SCANDAL.\nWHAT'S YOUR REACTION? >> WELL, I CAN'T IMAGINE THERE'S\nANY THERE, OR ANYTHING THAT'S REALLY GOING TO VAN AFFECT ON\nTHE ELECTION. I THINK THE DONALD TRUMP\nSUPPORTERS CURRENTLY WITH HIM, THIS IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING\nHE'S GOING TO THROW OUT TO HIS CROWD AND THEY'RE GOING TO SAY,\nSEE, SEE, SEE? THE CLINTON PEOPLE AND THE\nCLINTON VOTERS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE WITH HILLARY AND\nI THINK FOR THE UNDECIDED VOTERS, HOWEVER MANY THERE ARE\nAT THIS POINT, ARE GOING TO BE MORE CONCERNED WITH THE FACT\nTHAT THE ECONOMY IS GROWING. THE FACT THAT HILLARY CLINTON\nWANTS TO INVEST INTO THEM, AND THAT SHE'S MORE ON THEIR SIDE\nTHAN DONALD TRUMP IS, IN THE LIGHT OF HOW DONALD TRUMP\nBEHAVED IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS. SO I THINK WHILE THIS WILL MAKE\nNEWS FOR SURE, I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO HAVE MUCH OF AN\nEFFECT ON THE ELECTION. >> HERE'S WHAT PROBABLY WILL\nHAPPEN, JUST BASED ON MY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE HERE IN\nWASHINGTON, AND YOU KNOW THIS AS WELL.\nTHE FBI IS GOING TO TRY TO KEEP THIS INFORMATION RELATIVELY\nQUIET. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO LEAK ANY OF\nTHIS INFORMATION PRESUMABLY, ALTHOUGH YOU NEVER KNOW WHERE\nTHE LEAKS COME FROM, BUT I SUSPECT OVER THE NEXT 11 DAYS\nWE'RE GOING TO GET A LOT MORE INFORMATION.\nWHAT ARE THE DOCUMENTS, WHERE THESE DOCUMENTS CAME FROM, DID\nTHEY CONTAIN CLASSIFIED INFORMATION?\nWAS IT SIMPLY CONFIDENTIAL OR WAS IT SECRET?\nWAS IT TOP SECRET? SHOULD SHE HAVE KNOWN?\nWAS IT MARKED CLASSIFIED? ALL OF THESE KINDS OF ISSUES.\nONCE AGAIN, WE'VE REVIEWED THEM FOR MOSS AND MOSS LEADING TO THE\nDECISION NOT TO RECOMMEND CHARGES, MONTHS, AND IN THE NEXT\n11 DAYS A DOMINANT ISSUE AND I ASSUME IS WORRIED YOU AS A\nHILLARY CLINTON SUPPORTERS? >> AS I SAID, I DON'T THINK IT'S\nGOING TO HAVE A LOT OF EFFECT ON THE CURRENT ELECTORATE BUT I'LL\nSAY THIS. WHERE HAVE THESE DOCUMENTS,\nWHERE DID THEY COME FROM? HOW DID THE FBI GET TO THEM?\nWHERE ARE THEY? ALL THIS STUFF GOING ON WITH\nRUSSIA NOW. ALL OF WIKILEAKS ISSUES OF\nSTOLEN DOCUMENTS WE DON'T REALLY EVEN KNOW IF SOME HAVE BEEN\nMANIPULATED OR NOT MANIPULATED. WHY DIDN'T THE FBI HAVE THESE\nDOCUMENTS THROUGH ALL OF THE DIFFERENT INVESTIGATIONS THEY\nWENT THROUGH ON THIS WHERE THE FBI SAID THAT, YOU KNOW, SHE\nDIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG? THAT MAYBE CARELESS, THAT'S IT,\nAND WOULD HAVE HAD TO HAVE BEEN A HUGE CONSPIRACY OF 300 PEOPLE\nIN THE STATE DEPARTMENT CONSPIRING TO, YOU KNOW, RELEASE\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. WHY DIDN'T IT COME UP IN ALL OF\nTHIS? HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN\nTHOROUGHLY VETTED ON THIS ISSUE. THE FBI CHOSE NOT TO DO ANYTHING\nWITH THE INFORMATION. AND WE HAVE ALL MOVED ON.\nSO THE QUESTION IS -- WHERE DID THESE DOCUMENTS COME\nFROM? HOW DID THEY GET TO THE FBI?\nIS RUSSIA INVOLVED IN THIS? WE DON'T HAVE ANY CLUE WHERE\nTHIS STUFF IS COMING FROM, AND SO FOR THIS TO COME OUT --\n>> THE ONLY THING WE KNOW, HE SAYS, IN -- COMEY SAYS IT WAS IN\nCONNECTION WITH AN UNRELATED CASE.\nALL OF A SUDDEN THEY CAME UPON THESE E-MAILS THAT MAY OR MAY\nNOT CONTAIN CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.\nARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT THE DECISION THAT THE FBI DIRECTOR\nJAMES COMEY HAS NOW MADE BASED ON THE INFORMATION HE RECEIVED\nYESTERDAY TO REOPEN THIS CASE? IN OTHER WORDS, DO YOU HAVE\nCONFIDENCE IN COMEY? >> WELL, YES.\nI THINK -- I THINK COMEY HAS THROUGHOUT THIS UPSET BOTH\nSIDES. I THINK YOU CAN SAY, WHICH\nUSUALLY SHOWS A LEVEL OF FAIRNESS.\nNOW, THIS IS A HUGE SURPRISE THAT THIS WOULD COME OUT JUST\nDAYS BEFORE AN ELECTION. THAT, TO ME, IS A SURPRISE, BUT\nI THINK HE'S PROVEN HIMSELF TO BE THOROUGH, AS AN INVESTIGATOR\nAND THAT'S WHY I'M CONFIDENT WITH HIS PASS DECISION SAYING\nTHAT HILLARY CLINTON DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG AND I'M SURE\nAFTER GOING THROUGH TENS OF THOUSANDS OF E-MAILS, TENS OF\nTHOUSANDS, AND FOR A COUPLE TO BE RULED CLASSIFIED, EVEN WHEN\nTHEY WEREN'T PROPERLY MARKED CLASSIFIED.\nLIKE, THAT'S ALL T",

NOW, THE REST OF THE CALL WAS\nPOSITIVE, BUT IT IS, IT WAS STRIKING THAT 11 DAYS OUT TO\nHAVE THE DEPUTY CAMPAIGN MANAGER FOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAVE TO\nSAY THAT THEY ARE UNIFIED WITH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND IT\nREALLY REMINDS YOU AND RE-EMPHASIZES THEY'RE HAVING\nTROUBLE IN STATES STAYING EUN 23\nUNIFIED WITH THE PARTY ON THE GROUND.\n>> EVERYTHING'S FINE. >> THEY KEEP TELLING YOU THAT,\nTELLS YOU SOMETHING. MOLLY?\n>> TALKED BEFORE ABOUT EARLY VOTING NUMBERS.\n13 MILLION PEOPLE ALREADY VOTED. TALK ABOUT A LOW TURNOUT\nELECTION. PEOPLE SO DISCOURAGED ABOUT BOTH\nNOMINEES EVERYBODY WOULD NOT WANT TO VOTE.\nTHAT IS NOT WHAT WE ARE SEEING. VOTING IS AHEAD OF PACE OF 2012.\nPOSSIBLY EVEN ON PACE FOR 2008-LIKE TURNOUT, SIGNIFYING IN\nFACT EITHER THERE IS EXCITEMENT AROUND THIS ELECTION OR MORE\nLIKELY, THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN MACHINE IN PARTICULAR IS FORCING\nPEOPLE OUT TO VOTE. DOING WHAT IT WAS STRUCTURED TO\nDO, PARTICULARLY INFREQUENT VOTERS AND THE TYPES OF\nCONSTITUENCIES THAT DEMOCRATS NEED.\nYOUNG VOTERS, MINORITY VOTERS, HAVING SUCCESS IF PUSHING THEM\nOUT TO THE POLLS AND THAT IS GOING TO BE THE KEY TO\nEVERYTHING AND COULD MEAN THAT POTENTIALLY THERE IS VERY\nLOPSIDED TURNOUT IN THIS ELECTION.\n>> TURNOUT. DEMOCRAT/REPUBLICAN, MARTIAN, IG\nN AGO NOFG, INDEPENDENT, PLEASE\nVOTE. >> A MAGIC WAND GET DONE\nWHATEVER THEY WANT. THEY NEED ALL OF CONGRESS TO GET\nDONE WHAT THEY WANT DONE. DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO IMPLEMENT\nMULTIMILLION DOLLAR -- HILLARY CLINTON WAS A JOBS PLAN ON\nINFRASTRUCTURE AND MANUFACTURING, TAX THE WEALTHY\nTO PAY FOR SOME OF THIS AND IMMIGRATION, IF ABLE TO WIN AND\nSHOWING LATINOS HAVE COME TO HER SIDE MORE SO THAN PAST YEARS.\nONE THING IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR, THOUGH, IN THESE FIRST 100 DAYS,\nTHERE IS NOT GOING TO BE SOME KIND OF KUM BA YAH MOMENTS.\nOKAY? NOVEMBER 9th, PERMANENT\nINVESTIGATION LIKELY TO BEGIN IF HILLARY CLINTON DOES WIN.\nIT'S NOT GOING TO BE, YOU KNOW, MORNING IN AMERICA.\n>> NOT. NOT MORNING IN AMERICA.\nHOW QUICKLY WITH THIS? RECORD IN 2014 IN NORTH CAROLINA\nMOAT EXPENSIVE. HOW WOULD YOU SPEND $120\nMILLION? I BET NOT ALL ON A PENNSYLVANIA\nSENATE RACE. THE MOAT EXPENSIVE SENATE\nCAMPAIGN IN AMERICAN HISTORY. WOW.\n$120 MILLION, TO BE BEATING IN TWO YEARS, I'M SURE.\n\"WOLF\" IS HERE AFTER THE BREAK. SEE YOU TOMORROW.",

THEY REMEMBER THE 1950s OR THE\n'60s AND '70s WHEN THE CITIES WERE SCARY.\nHE IS SPEAKING AS -- THE POINT MADE MANY TIMES BEFORE ABOUT HIS\nMINORITY OUTREACH. THE PEOPLE HE'S REALLY SPEAKING\nTO ARE THE WHITE VOTERS WHO SHARE THOSE IMPRESSIONS.\n>> I WOULD SAY, THOUGH, THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF ENTRY-LEVEL\nTRUMP. YOU COULD GO THROUGH A LIST OF\nISSUES. ABORTION, TALKING ABOUT HOW\nWOMEN SHOULD, YOU KNOW, POTENTIALLY GO TO PRISONS.\nTHAT MADE PRO-LIFE ADVOCATES NUTS, BECAUSE THEY'VE SPENT\nDECADES, GENERATIONS TRYING TO FIGURE HOW TO MESSAGE ON SOME OF\nTHE MORE THORNY ISSUES. THINK ABOUT HIS BAD HOMBRES SAID\nAT THE DEBATE. BLOWING IRANIAN SHIPS OUT OF THE\nWATER. THE KINDS OF THINGS NOT ONLY A\nPOLISHED CANDIDATE, READS BRIEFING BOOKS, CAN FIGURE OUT\nTHE MESSAGE AND THE GET ONBOARD WITH THE USUAL SALEABLE TALKING\nPOINTS ARE AND YOU KNOW, SHOOT FROM THE HIP ALL YOU WANT WHEN\nYOU IGNORE SOME OF THAT STUFF.

THAT IS GOING TO BE ALL TIED TO\nEARLY VOTING, AND ON SUNDAY, SOULS TO THE POLLS GETTING LOTS\nOF VOTERS OUT AND DEMOCRATS ARE DOING THIS IN NORTH CAROLINA, BY\nTHE WAY, WITH FEWER PRECINCTS THIS TIME AROUND THAN THEY HAD\nAND MAINTAINING PACE. >> THE OTHER THING HILLARY\nCLINTON IS DOING IS SHE'S CAMPAIGNING IN A LOT OF\nBATTLEGROUND SENATE STATES. >> RIGHT.\n>> I WAS WITH HER LAST WEEKEND AND SHE WENT TO PENNSYLVANIA AND\nSHE CAMPAIGNED WITH KATIE McGINTY.\nWENT TO NORTH CAROLINA CAMPAIGNED WITH DEBORAH ROSS.\nNEW HAMPSHIRE, CAMPAIGNED WITH MAGGIE HASSAN.\nTARGETING THE STATES WHERE SHE IS NOW HOPEFULLY FOR DEMOCRATS\nLIFT UP THE BOTTOM OF THE TICKET, BECAUSE -- AT THIS\nPOINT, THERE ARE SO MANY TARGETS FOR THE DEMOCRATS AND THERE ARE\nSO FEW FOR DONALD TRUMP, THAT THEY CAN AFFORD TO FOCUS THEIR\nATTENTION ON THE BALLOT, CONVINCE THOSE DEMOCRATIC VOTERS\nCROSSOVER VOTERS HE NEED TO VOTE DEMOCRATIC.\n>> YOU MENTIONED THE DEMOCRATIC SENATE CANDIDATES ARE WITH\nHILLARY CLINTON WHEN SHE DOES THESE EVENTS.\nKELLY AYOTTE IN VERMONT. PAT TOOMEY RUNS TO OHIO IN NORTH\nCAROLINA, RICHARD BURR NOWHERE TO BE FOUND.\nREPUBLICANS WON'T STAND WITH DONALD TRUMP BUT WILL WITH\nHILLARY CLINTON. HILLARY CLINTON THINK THEY HAVE\nMOMENTUM, SURROGATES ON THE TRAIL, DOING WELL IN EARLY\nVOTING THEY THINK. GO TO WIKILEAKS OR LISTEN TO\nDONALD TRUMP ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL TALKING OF LATE OF BILL\nCLINTON INC. AND ALL THIS CONCERN INSIDE THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN. NOT JUST OUT IN REPUBLICAN LAND.\nHER OWN CAMPAIGN STAFF SAY, OOH. SOME DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.\nYES, CLINTONS FOUNDATION IS A CHARITY, DOES WONDERFUL THINGS\nAND DOES DO IMPORTANT AND WONDERFUL THING AROUND THE WORLD\nBUT IS HE MAKING A BOATLOAD OF MONEY OFF ON THE SIDE OR STAFF\nPERSONALLY ON THE SIDE? DONALD TRUMP PUTS IT THIS WAY --\n>> IF THE CLINTONS WERE WILLING TO PLAY THIS FAST AND LOOSE WITH\nTHEIR ENTERPRISE WHEN THEY WEREN'T IN THE WHITE HOUSE, JUST\nIMAGINE WHAT THEY'LL DO GIVEN THE CHANCE TO ONCE AGAIN CONTROL\nTHE OVAL OFFICE. AND WE'VE HAD ENOUGH.\nHONESTLY I THINK WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THE CLINTONS, IN ALL\nFAIRNESS. >> IT'S REALLY AN EFFECTIVE\nLINE. >> REALLY.\n>> VOTERS DECIDE IF WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THE CLINTONS.\nVOTERS GET TO DECIDE. DO THIS AGAIN?\nA PERFECTLY FAIR QUESTION CAN SHE GET TO ELECTION DAY WITHOUT\nTAKING QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS? THEY SAY RUSSIANS HACKED THE\nE-MAILS. NOT TALKING ABOUT IT.\nA FOREIGN STATE ACTOR MEDDLES, THAT'S IMPORTANT, BUT WHAT CAN\nTHE E-MAILS TELL US? GET TO ELECTION DAY WITHOUT A\nNEWS CONFERENCE OR DOING A FEW INTERVIEWS AND ADDRESSING\nSERIOUS ISSUES ABOUT, A., WHAT HAPPENED, AND B., WHAT IF\nPRESIDENT? WHAT WILL YOU TO DO BE CERTAIN\nTHIS DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN? >> SHE OUGHT TO BE ACCOUNTABLE\nAND ANSWER. A DIFFERENT QUESTION WHETHER SHE\nWILL BEFORE ELECTION DAY BUT CERTAINLY SHOULD.\nHE'S E-MAILS ARE EXACTLY THE KINDS OF THING THAT PEOPLE HAVE\nCONCERNS OVER WHEN IT COMES TO THE CLINTONS AND HOW THEY MIX\nTHEIR POLITICAL AND PERSONAL AND -- CHARITABLE ENDEAVORS.\nIF YOU HAVE A REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT WHO\nCOULD PROSECUTE THE CASE AND DOESN'T HAVE A SORT OF\nO'HARE-TYPE LEVEL OF HIS OWN BAGGAGE COMING THROUGH IT WOULD\nBE A REALLY TOUGH STORY FOR HER IN THE FINAL WEEKS OF THE\nCAMPAIGN TRAIL. IMAGINE IF YOU HAD A REPUBLICAN\nCANDIDATE WHO COULD HAMMER THAT THING?\nA VERY DIFFERENT STORY NOW. >> IF HE WERE ABLE TO SAY SHE'S\nSTATUS QUO AND STICK TO A STATUS QUO MESSAGE AND PEOPLE HAVE HAD\nENOUGH OF THE CLINTONS TO TAKE HALF OF WHAT BARBARA BUSH HAD\nSAID. ENOUGH OF THE BUSHES AND THE\nCLINTONS. ABLE TO HAMMER THAT MESSAGE AND\nMAKE SOMETHING EFFECTIVE ON CHANGE, HE HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO\nDO THAT HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO MAKE THAT CASE AND IT'S BEEN REALLY\nDIFFICULT BUT TELLS YOU SOMETHING HOW HILLARY CLINTON\nWOULD GOVERN. SO MANY -- YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH\nBE ASSURED AMBASSADORS ARE STILL GOING TO BE THE PEOPLE GIVEN\nDONATIONS, AND PLUM POSTS. WANT A ZONE OF PRIVACY.\nWHY SHE SET UP THIS E-MAIL SERVER IN THE FIRST PLACE.\nQUESTIONS OF HILLARY CLINTON'S FORTHRIGHTNESS THAT HER CAMPAIGN\nAND THE PEOPLE AROUND HER VERY MUCH KNEW IN THE BEGINNING AND\nSOMETHING THAT THE WIKILEAKS E-MAIL CERTAINLY --\n>> I HOPE AND THINK THAT TRYING TO HOLD OTHER ACCOUNTABLE FOR\nWHAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST HOPEFULLY GETS A LESSON IN THE\nFUTURE. AS WE MOVE ON, THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN IS CHANGING THE WAY WE LOOK AT THE ELECTORAL MAP.\nMOST OF THE CHANGES, NOT TO",

SO LAWYERS ARE LOOKING TO SEE\nWHAT THE ACTUAL VOTE LOOKS LIKE AND WHETHER OR NOT THE FLORIDA\nSTATUTE IS GOING TO COME INTO P\nPLAY. >> WHAT ABOUT ALL THIS TALK\nTRUMP IS CALLING ON PEOPLE TO WATCH THE POLLS, KEEP YOUR EYE\nON THE POLLS? WHAT IS ALLOWED THERE?\nWHAT DOES THAT MEAN EXACTLY? >> WELL, THERE'S POLL WATCHERS\nIN ALL ELECTIONS AND BOTH PARTIES HAVE POLL WATCHERS.\nAND THEY ARE ALLOWED TO STAND A CERTAIN DISTANCE FROM THE VOTING\nPLACE. THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO ATTACK\nTHE PERSON GOING TO DECIDE ON THEIR VOTE.\nTHEY HAVE TO ACT IN A VERY PROPER MANNER.\nIF NOT THEY ARE EJECTED.

THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS\nCRITICAL TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE THE\nRIGHT TO VOTE. ANOTHER THING THAT HAS HAPPENED\nIN THE PAST IS THAT THE POLLS HAVE SHUT DOWN WITH PEOPLE IN\nLINE WANTING TO VOTE. I WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE\nTHAT HAPPENED IN AN ELECTION IN FLORIDA NOT SO LONG AGO, IS IT\nJUST SO HAPPENED IN A BLACK NEIGHBORHOOD THAT THEY DECIDED\nTO DO SOME SEWAGE CLEANING AT THE TIME THE PEOPLE WERE\nSTANDING IN LINE, AND OBVIOUSLY THE SMELL FROM THAT CLEANING WAS\nHORRIFIC AND WHAT YOU HAVE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CALL INTO THE\nELECTION SUPERVISOR. I WAS ACTIVE ALSO IN THE KERRY\nCAMPAIGN. WE LEARNED FROM THE PREVIOUS\nGORE CAMPAIGN, EVERY PERSON HAD A CELL PHONE SO THEY COULD\nIMMEDIATELY, EVERY PERSON WHO WAS A POLL WATCHER HAD THE CELL\nPHONE SO THEY COULD IMMEDIATELY CONTACT THE ELECTION SUPERVISOR.\nYOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE WERE ENOUGH LINES AVAILABLE INTO THE\nELECTION SUPERVISOR TO DEAL WITH ANY PROBLEM THAT MIGHT COME UP\nDURING THE ELECTION. >> AND WITH THE RHETORIC IN THIS\nELECTION SO FAR, THERE ARE A LOT MORE PEOPLE WATCHING THESE POLLS\nVERY VERY CLOSELY BUT LEARNING WHAT THE RULES ARE AND WHAT'S\nALLOWED AT THESE POLLING STATIONS IS A VERY IMPORTANT\nTHING AND WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT GOING FORWARD.\nTHANKS SO MUCH.",

HE WAS BOOKED BUT CANCELED THIS\nMORNING. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT\nARE FACING EVERY CANDIDATE, FACING ALL THE VOTERS AS THEY\nARE PREPARING TO HEAD TO THE POLLS.\nIS OBAMACARE WORKING? >> WELL, LISTEN, IT'S CLEARLY\nDONE SOME VERY GOOD THINGS. IT'S PROVIDED INSURANCE TO\nFAMILIES AND LOVED ONES WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, IT'S\nPROVIDED INSURANCE TO MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY\nTHAT DID NOT HAVE IT. IT'S ALLOWED OUR YOUNGER\nGENERATION TO STAY ON THEIR FAMILY'S INSURANCE POLICY NOW\nUNTIL THEY'RE 26, IN CERTAIN CASES COMPANIES CAN EXTEND THAT\nBENEFIT TO 30 YEARS.

NO.\nTHAT'S NOT THE WAY TO DO IT. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE THINGS\nTHAT AREN'T WORKING AND CLEARLY THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT\nAREN'T WORKING, AND SOLVE THOSE PROBLEMS.\nWE NEED TO STRENGTHEN THE THINGS THAT ARE WORKING.\nTHERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE WORKING AND THINGS THAT AREN'T.\nI LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH CONGRESS TO SOLVE THE THINGS\nTHAT NEED TO BE SOLVED. >> YOU PROBABLY HAVE SEEN THE\nWIKILEAKS, HACKED E-MAILS COMING FROM THE KRCLINTON CAMPAIGN.\nTHERE HAS BEEN A NUMBER OF THINGS REVEALED INCLUDING\nINFORMATION ABOUT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION ALTHOUGH THERE WAS A\nLOT KNOWN ABOUT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION BEFORE THE WIKILEAKS\nISSUE CAME UP. ARE YOU COMFORTABLE WITH HOW THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION RAISED MONEY AT THE SAME TIME THAT BILL\nCLINTON WAS MAKING MONEY OFF OF SOME OF THE SAME PEOPLE FOR PAID\nSPEECHES? >> WHAT I AM COMFORTABLE WITH IS\nTHE WONDERFUL THINGS THE CLINTON FOUNDATION HAS DONE IN THE\nUNITED STATES AND WORLDWIDE. CLEAN WATER, SANITATION\nPRODUCTS, HUMANITARIAN NEEDS, ISSUES WITH OUR REFUGEE CRISIS\nAROUND THE WORLD, PROMOTING DEVELOPMENT, EXPANDING\nOPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN, NOT ONLY IN THIS COUNTRY BUT ALL\nOVER THE WORLD. THERE ARE A LOT OF VERY GOOD\nTHINGS THE CLINTON FOUNDATION DOES AND I STAND BEHIND THOSE.\n>> HERE'S THE THING. WE HAVE HEARD VERY SIMILAR\nANSWER FROM THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN AND THE DNC TO BE QUITE HONEST.\nIT FEELS A LITTLE BIT LIKE A DODGE, MR. PERKINS.\nNO ONE WANTS TO ANSWER DIRECTLY TO THE QUESTION OF THIS CLOSE\nRELATIONSHIP, WHAT REPUBLICANS POINT TO IS PAY TO PLAY BETWEEN\nTHE CLINTON FOUNDATION AND CLINTON FAMILY.\nI'M KIND OF STRUCK THAT IF AND WHEN DONALD TRUMP FACES SIMILAR\nQUESTIONS OR WOULD DODGE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TRUMP\nFOUNDATION, DEMOCRATS WOULD BE LIGHTING THEIR HAIR ON FIRE.\nWHAT'S DIFFERENT HERE? >> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I'M\nRUNNING TO REPRESENT DISTRICT 18 IN CONGRESS AND WE HAVE UNIQUE\nISSUES IN THIS DISTRICT, WHETHER IT'S OUR ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES\nSPECIFIC TO THIS DISTRICT, SAME ISSUES WE HAVE HAD OUR SENIORS\nIN THIS DISTRICT AND ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.\nOPPORTUNITIES FOR SINGLE MOTHERS, OUR VETERANS, JOB\nOPPORTUNITIES, THE ECONOMY. SO I'M RUNNING TO REPRESENT\nTHIS. WHOEVER REPRESENTS THIS\nDISTRICT, WHETHER ME OR MY OPPONENT, THEIR JOB IS TO\nREPRESENT THE INTERESTS OF THIS DISTRICT, NOT ONLY THE\nDEMOCRATS, INDEPENDENTS AND REPUBLICANS ALIKE.\nTHAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO CONCENTRATE ON.\n>> SURE. BUT YOU WERE AT THE HILLARY\nCLINTON EVENT IN LAKE WORTH THIS WEEK.\nSHE TALKED ABOUT YOU, YOU TALKED ABOUT HER.\nCLEARLY YOU ARE SUPPORTING HER CAMPAIGN.\nWE ARE JUST TRYING TO ESTABLISH AGAIN, IT'S INTERESTING FOR\nVOTERS AROUND THE COUNTRY TO GET A FEEL FOR WHAT'S GOING ON OUT\nTHERE IN SOME DIFFERENT PLACES, WHAT IT'S LIKE TO RUN WITH\nDIFFERENT PEOPLE AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET.\nTHERE HAVE BEEN ISSUES AND QUESTIONS ABOUT HONEST AND\nTRUSTWORTHINESS, AN ISSUE WHERE HILLARY CLINTON HAS NOT BEEN\nPOLLING STRONGLY. IN SOME CASES SHE TRAILS DONALD\nTRUMP ON THAT ISSUE. SO DO YOU THINK THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON IS HONEST? >> I DO THINK SHE'S HONEST.\nI THINK SHE'S THE BEST, CLEARLY THE BEST CHOICE FOR PRESIDENT\nFOR OUR ECONOMY, FOR OUR JOBS, FOR KEEPING THIS COUNTRY SAFE,\nFOR OUR SENIORS, FOR OUR VETERANS.\nBUT I THINK WE SHOULD DO THIS. I THINK BOTH REPUBLICANS AND\nDEMOCRATS NEED TO QUIT LOOKING IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR ABOUT\nWHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY AND START FOCUSING ON HOW TO WORK\nTOGETHER TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF TODAY AND TOMORROW.\nUNTIL WE GET TO THAT POINT ON BOTH SIDES, WE'RE NOT GOING TO\nREALLY MOVE THE DIAL ON THE THINGS WE NEED TO MOVE THE DIAL\nON IN THIS COUNTRY.

I THINK HE'S DOING A GREAT JOB.\nHE'S BEEN GREAT FOR THIS DISTRICT.\nMOST IMPORTANTLY, HE HAS CLEARLY SHOWN HIS ABILITY TO WORK CROSS\nTHE AISLE AND I'M GOING TO BEAT THAT DRUM DAY IN AND DAY OUT.\nIT'S HARD ENOUGH TO WORK WITH PEOPLE IN YOUR OWN PARTY, BUT IF\nYOU CAN'T REACH ACROSS THE AISLE AND WORK WITH REPUBLICANS ON\nYOUR COMMITTEES AND SUBCOMMITTEES, NOTHING IS GOING\nTO GET DONE IN THIS COUNTRY FOR ANY OF US.\n>> LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT ANSWER.\nYOU SAID HILLARY CLINTON IS DEFINITELY GOING TO WIN.\nPATRICK MURPHY YOU SAY YOU ARE DEFINITELY VOTING FOR HIM.\nTHAT'S A DIFFERENT ANSWER. >> LET ME CLARIFY THAT.\nPATRICK MURPHY WILL BE THE NEXT U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF\nFLORIDA. >> APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.\nTHANK YOU FOR JOINING US. >> THANK YOU.\nAPPRECIATE IT.",

I WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE\nTHAT HAPPENED IN AN ELECTION IN FLORIDA NOT SO LONG AGO, IS IT\nJUST SO HAPPENED IN A BLACK NEIGHBORHOOD THAT THEY DECIDED\nTO DO SOME SEWAGE CLEANING AT THE TIME THE PEOPLE WERE\nSTANDING IN LINE, AND OBVIOUSLY THE SMELL FROM THAT CLEANING WAS\nHORRIFIC AND WHAT YOU HAVE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CALL INTO THE\nELECTION SUPERVISOR.

WE LEARNED FROM THE PREVIOUS\nGORE CAMPAIGN, EVERY PERSON HAD A CELL PHONE SO THEY COULD\nIMMEDIATELY, EVERY PERSON WHO WAS A POLL WATCHER HAD THE CELL\nPHONE SO THEY COULD IMMEDIATELY CONTACT THE ELECTION SUPERVISOR.\nYOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE WERE ENOUGH LINES AVAILABLE INTO THE\nELECTION SUPERVISOR TO DEAL WITH ANY PROBLEM THAT MIGHT COME UP\nDURING THE ELECTION. >> AND WITH THE RHETORIC IN THIS\nELECTION SO FAR, THERE ARE A LOT MORE PEOPLE WATCHING THESE POLLS\nVERY VERY CLOSELY BUT LEARNING WHAT THE RULES ARE AND WHAT'S\nALLOWED AT THESE POLLING STATIONS IS A VERY IMPORTANT\nTHING AND WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT GOING FORWARD.\nTHANKS SO MUCH.",

I THINK BOTH REPUBLICANS AND\nDEMOCRATS NEED TO QUIT LOOKING IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR ABOUT\nWHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY AND START FOCUSING ON HOW TO WORK\nTOGETHER TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF TODAY AND TOMORROW.\nUNTIL WE GET TO THAT POINT ON BOTH SIDES, WE'RE NOT GOING TO\nREALLY MOVE THE DIAL ON THE THINGS WE NEED TO MOVE THE DIAL\nON IN THIS COUNTRY. THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE.\n>> SO LOOKING WILDLY INTO THE FUTURE, MEANING A WEEK PLUS, IS\nHILLARY CLINTON GOING TO WIN FLORIDA?\n>> ABSOLUTELY SHE'S GOING TO WIN FLORIDA.\nI LOOK FORWARD TO SERVING THIS DISTRICT WHEN SHE'S PRESIDENT OF\nTHE UNITED STATES. >> ALL RIGHT.\nMAYBE A TOUGHER QUESTION. IS PATRICK MURPHY, THE DEMOCRAT\nRUNNING TO UNSEAT MARCO RUBIO, IS HE GOING TO WIN NEXT WEEK?\n>> I BELIEVE I'M CLEARLY VOTING FOR PATRICK AS WELL AS HILLARY\nAND SUPPORTING THEM BOTH VERY STRONGLY AS THEY ARE ME.\nTHERE ARE POLLS ALL OVER THE PLACE, CLEARLY, WE ALL KNOW\nTHAT. I THINK HE'S DOING A GREAT JOB.\nHE'S BEEN GREAT FOR THIS DISTRICT.\nMOST IMPORTANTLY, HE HAS CLEARLY SHOWN HIS ABILITY TO WORK CROSS\nTHE AISLE AND I'M GOING TO BEAT THAT DRUM DAY IN AND DAY OUT.\nIT'S HARD ENOUGH TO WORK WITH PEOPLE IN YOUR OWN PARTY, BUT IF\nYOU CAN'T REACH ACROSS THE AISLE AND WORK WITH REPUBLICANS ON\nYOUR COMMITTEES AND SUBCOMMITTEES, NOTHING IS GOING\nTO GET DONE IN THIS COUNTRY FOR ANY OF US.\n>> LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT ANSWER.\nYOU SAID HILLARY CLINTON IS DEFINITELY GOING TO WIN.\nPATRICK MURPHY YOU SAY YOU ARE DEFINITELY VOTING FOR HIM.\nTHAT'S A DIFFERENT ANSWER. >> LET ME CLARIFY THAT.\nPATRICK MURPHY WILL BE THE NEXT U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF\nFLORIDA. >> APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.\nTHANK YOU FOR JOINING US. >> THANK YOU.\nAPPRECIATE IT.",

      "text": "WOULD THAT DO AT THIS POINT.\nI WILL SAY THAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND THE RNC HELD A\nJOINT CONFERENCE CALL EARLIER THIS MORNING.\nTHEY ARE SAYING THAT THERE IS NO DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN AND THE RNC WHEN IT COMES TO GETTING OUT THE VOTE\nFOR THIS CAMPAIGN. IN THIS FINAL STRETCH, THE\nCAMPAIGN IS SAYING THEY ARE GOING TO BE DEVOTING MOST OF\nTHEIR RESOURCES TO DIGITAL AND TV ADVERTISING WHILE THE RNC\nWILL BE WORKING ON GETTING OUT THE VOTE.\nTHEY SAY THEIR DOOR KNOCKING OPERATION IS EXCEEDING WHERE\nTHINGS WERE IN 2012. THEY ARE PREACHING A LOT OF\nCONFIDENCE AT THIS POINT. THE QUESTION, THOUGH, IS GOING\nTO COME DOWN TO TURNOUT, GETTING THIS CAMPAIGN TO GET ITS\nVOLUNTEERS TO THE POLLS, JUST SORT OF THAT GOOD OLD-FASHIONED\nPOLITICKING THAT WE HAD QUESTIONS ABOUT DURING THE\nPRIMARIES. REMEMBER WE ASKED THOSE\nQUESTIONS DURING THE PRIMARIES, IS DONALD TRUMP REALLY JUST A\nCAMPAIGN ABOUT HIMSELF AND SO FORTH, BUT HE SHOWED DURING\nTHOSE PRIMARIES THAT YES, THE BIG RALLIES CAN TRANSLATE IN\nGETTING PEOPLE TO THE POLLS AND THAT HE CAN REALLY RUN UP THE\nSCOREBOARD WHEN IT COMES TO ELECTION DAY.\nOF COURSE, ALL OF THAT IS GOING TO BE TESTED BECAUSE HE DOES NOT\nHAVE A COMPETITOR, DID NOT HAVE A CHALLENGER LIKE HE DOES RIGHT\nNOW IN HILLARY CLINTON. BUT HE'S GOING TO BE OUT HERE IN\nABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF FROM NOW.\nI THINK ONE OTHER BIG QUESTION, DOES DONALD TRUMP ADDRESS THESE\nLATEST ECONOMIC NUMBERS SHOWING 2.9% GROWTH IN THE THIRD QUARTER\nAS HE'S BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG THIS ECONOMY IS NOT DOING AS\nWELL AS IT SHOULD RIGHT NOW. DOES HE WEIGH IN ON THOSE\nNUMBERS WHEN HE COMES OUT HERE IN ABOUT 90 MINUTES FROM NOW.\n>> THOSE NUMBERS JUST OUT. WE WILL TALK ABOUT THEM IN A\nMINUTE. A LOT BETTER THAN A LOT OF\nECONOMISTS HAD PREDICTED. JIM ACOSTA, THANKS SO MUCH.\nWE ARE STILL A MONTH AWAY FROM THANKSGIVING BUT THIS MORNING\nTHERE'S A POLITICAL FLOAT SO BIG IT WON'T EVEN FIT IN THE MACY'S\nPARADE. REPORTS THAT SOMEHOW, JUST\nAPPEARED OUT OF NOWHERE THAT SHOULD SHE WIN, HILLARY CLINTON\nIS CONSIDERING JOE BIDEN AS SECRETARY OF STATE.\nTHE SAME JOE BIDEN WHO IS CURRENTLY THE VICE PRESIDENT.\n>> CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT ELISE LABOTT IS AT\nTHE STATE DEPARTMENT WATCHING ALL OF THIS.\nTALK TO US ABOUT THIS FLOAT. >> IF YOU REMEMBER, IN 2012,\nTHERE WERE THESE RUMORS THEY WERE GOING -- THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON AS SECRETARY OF STATE AND JOE BIDEN WERE GOING TO\nSWITCH JOBS. YOU ALWAYS HAVE THIS KIND OF\nSPECULATION WHEN THERE COMES TIME TO NAME A CABINET.\nCERTAINLY BOTH HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP ARE LOOKING TO\nPREPARE FOR THE INEVITABILITY OF BEING PRESIDENT, NAMING A\nCABINET AND SECRETARY OF STATE IS OBVIOUSLY ONE THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON'S GOING TO BE LOOKING AT VERY CLOSELY HAVING SERVED IN\nTHE JOB. SO POLITICAL REPORTING THIS\nMORNING THAT JOE BIDEN IS THE VERY TOP OF A SHORT LIST OF\nCANDIDATES FOR SECRETARY OF STATE.\nOUR REPORTING SUGGESTS HIS NAME IS BEING BANDIED ABOUT BY HER\nTRANSITION TEAM AS PART OF A VERY LONG LIST OF QUALIFIED\nCANDIDATES THAT COULD BE PRESENTED TO HER FOR SECRETARY\nOF STATE. NOTHING HAS BEEN PRESENTED TO\nHER YET. BUT THAT LIST RANGES FROM JOE\nBIDEN TO FORMER TOP STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS TO POSSIBLY\nEVEN SECRETARY KERRY HIMSELF STAYING IN THE JOB.\nSO NOT REALLY SURE THAT HE'S REALLY AT THE TOP OF THAT LIST.\nIT WOULDN'T PUT IT PAST SECRETARY CLINTON TO NAME\nSOMEONE OUT OF THE BOX AND CERTAINLY JOE BIDEN WOULD BE AN\nUNORTHODOX CANDIDATE, BUT HE DID SERVE AS CHAIRMAN OF THE FOREIGN\nRELATIONS, SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE, HAS HANDLED\nA LOT OF INTERNATIONAL ISSUES FOR THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION,\nBUT IF YOU LOOK BACK, HIM AND SECRETARY CLINTON HAVE DISAGREED\nON A LOT OF FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES RANGING FROM IRAQ,\nAFGHANISTAN, NOW THE WAR IN SYRIA.\nSO IT'S CERTAINLY A LOT OF FUN SPECULATION AND HIS NAME IS\nBEING BANDIED ABOUT AS SOMEONE THAT COULD DO THE JOB, BUT NOT\nSURE HE'S REALLY THE MOST LIKELY CANDIDATE.\n>> THAT'S RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.\nGREAT TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH.\nWITH US TO DISCUSS, MARY KATHERINE HAMM, POLITICAL\nCOMMENTATOR AND SENIOR WRITER FOR THE FEDERALIST.\nDEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST AND HILLARY CLINTON SUPPORTER, EMILY\nSISMAN, CAMPAIGN DIRECTOR FOR THE CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROCESS\nACTION FUND. JOHN PHILLIPS, DONALD TRUMP\nSUPPORTER AND ALEX BURN, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER AT\nTHE \"NEW YORK TIMES.\" THANKS FOR BEING HERE.\nEMILY, THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN OR SOMEONE WITHIN CLINTON LAND\nFLOATING JOE BIDEN AT THE TOP OF THE LIST POTENTIALLY FOR\nSECRETARY OF STATE. THIS SMELLS OF DELIBERATE.\nHM? >> POTENTIALLY.\nI DO THINK HE WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT CHOICE FOR HER.\nWHAT I THINK IT SHOWS BY HER PUTTING THE NAME OUT THERE,\nSOMEBODY IN CLINTON LAND PUTTING THE FAME OUT THERE, SHE'S\nSERIOUS ABOUT GOVERNING. IF YOU ARE JUST TRYING TO GET TO\nELECTION DAY AND JUST TRYING TO BRING PEOPLE OUT ON THE OTHER\nSIDE TO VOTE AGAINST THE OTHER CANDIDATE OR WHATEVER IS\nHAPPENING RIGHT NOW, THEN THEY WOULDN'T BE TALKING SERIOUSLY\nABOUT SOMEBODY TO RUN ONE OF THE MOST MAJOR CABINET POSTS WHO HAS\nA LONG HISTORY WORKING WITH BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE.\nPEOPLE REALLY RESPECT BIDEN WITHIN THE SENATE.\nHE HAS A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP. I THINK BY PUTTING A PINKY TOE\nOUT THERE OF INDICATING WHO SHE MAY BE POTENTIALLY LOOKING FOR\nFOR CABINET POST, IT SHOWS SHE'S VERY SERIOUS ABOUT GETTING\nTHINGS DONE AND ACTUALLY WORKING TOWARDS SOLUTIONS.\n>> ALL RIGHT. ALEX, VERY QUICKLY ON THIS\nSUBJECT, I THINK IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON FROM THIS FRLOAT, HOW\nMANY VOTERS DOES THIS SWAY? >> I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE ARE\nTHAT MANY. MAYBE IN DELAWARE THAT'S A BIG\nFLOAT. I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE ARE A\nLOT OF PEOPLE UNDECIDED WHO WILL SAY IF I COULD HAVE JOE BIDEN AS\nSECRETARY OF STATE I WILL VOTE FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nHAVING SAID THAT, I THINK IT SHOWS HOW MUCH THIS RACE HAS\nMOVED OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS FROM IF YOU THINK BACK TO THE\nBEGINNING OF THIS CAMPAIGN WE ALL THOUGHT THAT THE BIGGEST\nDANGER FOR HILLARY CLINTON WOULD BE GETTING PORTRAYED AS THE\nTHIRD TERM OF BARACK OBAMA. THE FACT JOE BIDEN IS IN THE MIX\nFOR A ROLE LIKE THIS, SHE'S REALLY STAKED HER CANDIDACY ON\nTHE IDEA OF FOUR MORE YEARS. >> OF COURSE, IT ONLY MATTERS IF\nSHE WINS. RIGHT?\nTHERE IS SOME NEW POLLING OUT TODAY, ABC NEWS WHICH IS DOING A\nDAILY TRACK, I'M OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER WHEN ABC NEWS AND \"THE\nWASHINGTON POST\" HAD HILLARY CLINTON UP BY 12 POINTS.\n>> EARLIER THIS WEEK. >> MONDAY.\nNOW IT'S FOUR. SO ALEX, THE QUESTION IS, HOW\nMUCH IS THEIR HAIR ON FIRE OVER THIS AND HOW MUCH SHOULD IT BE?\n>> IN THE BIG PICTURE, HILLARY CLINTON HAS HAD A PRETTY STEADY\nLEAD IN THE MID TO HIGH SINGLE DIGITS.\nA COUPLE OF THE POLL NUMBERS THAT HAD HER AT 10, 11, 12 POINT\nLEAD, THOSE WERE EYE-POPPING AND I THINK PROBABLY MAY HAVE BEEN\nOVERSTATED AT THE TIME. I KNOW TALKING TO THE CLINTON\nPEOPLE FROM LAST WEEK, THE LAST COUPLE DAYS, THEY HAVE ALWAYS\nANTICIPATED THAT THIS RACE WOULD TIGHTEN, THAT IF WE WERE TAKING\nTHE TEMPERATURE OF THE CAMPAIGN, REALLY AT A LOW POINT FOR DONALD\nTRUMP WHEN REPUBLICANS WERE JUST DESERTING HIS CANDIDACY IN\nDROVES, REPUBLICANS EVEN THEN HAD THE SENSE SOME OF THOSE\nVOTERS WOULD COME BACK INTO THE FOLD.\nI DON'T KNOW, WE STILL HAVEN'T SEEN A MAJOR NATIONAL POLL THAT\nSHOWS THIS EVEN AS A TOSS-UP RACE.\nI WOULDN'T NECESSARILY OVERREAD THE MOVEMENT OVER THE LAST\nCOUPLE DAYS. >> KIND OF A LITTLE TO YOUR\nPOINT, EVEN REPUBLICANS WILL SAY THIS IS A LITTLE BIT IF NOT A\nLOT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS OF REPUBLICANS COMING HOME.\nIF REPUBLICANS ARE COMING HOME, IF THIS IS WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE,\nWHAT'S BRINGING THEM HOME? >> LOOK, I THINK IT MAY BE JUST\nCOMING DOWN TO THE WIRE AND GETTING IN THE BOOTH AND BEING\nFACED WITH THIS DECISION. BY THE WAY, I THINK THE JOE\nBIDEN THING IS AS SIMPLE AS HAVING MICHELLE OBAMA ON THE\nTRAIL, HEY, YOU GUYS DON'T LIKE ME THIS MUCH, LET'S TALK ABOUT\nSOMEONE YOU DO LIKE, JOE BIDEN. I THINK IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.\nLOOK, I THINK THERE IS SOME COMING HOME BUT WHEN IT COMES TO\nTHESE INDIVIDUAL STATES LIKE FLORIDA WHICH HE REALLY HAS TO\nWIN, YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS LIKE 85% OF REPUBLICANS WITH HIM\nAS OPPOSED TO '92 WITH MITT ROMNEY, THERE'S GOT TO BE A LOT\nOF MOVEMENT THERE. THERE'S GOT TO BE A LOT OF\nMOVEMENT IN NOT THAT MUCH TIME WHEN AS WE HAVE HEARD OVER THE\nPAST COUPLE DAYS, HE'S NOT RAISING THAT MUCH MONEY OR\nSPENDING THAT MUCH MONEY OR THROWING THAT MUCH OF HIS OWN\nMONEY INTO THIS RACE WHEN HE RELIES ON THE RNC FOR GET OUT\nTHE VOTE. I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH OF THAT'S\nGOING TO HAPPEN IN THE LAST, WHAT, 11 DAYS HERE.\n>> AND VOTING HAS ACTUALLY ALREADY STARTED IN MOST MAJOR\nSWING STATES, IN ALMOST EVERY STATE PEOPLE ARE VOTING BY MAIL\nOR VOTING IN EARLY VOTE LOCATIONS.\nSO HOW MUCH PLACE DOES HE HAVE TO MOVE?\n>> SORRY TO CUT YOU OFF. MARY KATHERINE TALKING ABOUT\nREPUBLICANS COMING HOME BUT IF THEY ARE, THEY ARE SORT OF MAYBE\nLOCKING THE DOORS TO DONALD TRUMP A LITTLE BIT.\nBECAUSE THERE ARE THESE ADS OUT THERE NOW BEING FLOATED BY A\nREPUBLICAN SUPER PAC SPECIFICALLY SUGGESTING THAT\nHILLARY CLINTON IS GOING TO WIN AND YOU NEED TO ELECT THIS\nSENATOR OR CONGRESSMAN TO STAND UP.\nWATCH. >> NO ONE WOULD GIVE HILLARY A\nBLANK CHECK TO RUN UP TRILLIONS IN NEW DEBTS AND JOB-DESTROYING\nTAXES. >> ONE HILLARY IN WASHINGTON\nWOULD BE BAD ENOUGH. >> IT SEEMS MIXED MESSAGES.\nREPUBLICANS COMING HOME ON THE ONE HAND, IF YOU LOOK AT THE\nPOLLS BUT ON THE OTHER HAND SAYING WE THINK TRUMP'S DONE SO\nWE TRYING TO STAND UP TO HILLARY CLINTON.\n>> WELL, WE HAVE SEEN DIFFERENT DYNAMICS IN THIS RACE THAT IN\n2012 AND 2008, WHERE MITT ROMNEY DID VERY WELL IN THE DEEPLY RED\nSTATES. HE CLEANED BARACK OBAMA'S CLOCK\nIN TEXAS AND A LOT OF THE SOUTHERN STATES, PLACES LIKE\nUTAH, THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN WEST, BUT THEN LOST ALL OF THOSE\nPURPLE STATES THAT ARE UP FOR GRABS THIS TIME AROUND.\nIN 2016, TRUMP IS DOING MUCH WORSE THAN MITT ROMNEY IN PLACES\nLIKE UTAH, ARIZONA, TEXAS, ALTHOUGH I THINK HE WILL\nULTIMATELY END UP WINNING IN THOSE STATES, BUT HAS PERFORMED\nMUCH STRONGER IN THOSE PURPLE STATES, IN PLACES LIKE NORTH\nCAROLINA, OHIO, IOWA, THAN MITT ROMNEY AND JOHN McCAIN.\nSO IF YOU ARE A REPUBLICAN THAT'S RUNNING IN A RED STATE,\nTHEN THINGS ARE PROBABLY A LOT MORE TIGHT THIS TIME AROUND THAN\nTHEY WERE IN PREVIOUS YEARS. IN PURPLE STATES, I THINK THE\nTOP OF THE TICKET IS HELPING YOU MORE THAN IT HAS IN RECENT\nELECTIONS. >> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT?\n>> I THINK JOHN HAS A GOOD POINT ABOUT THE SHIFTING GEOGRAPHY OF\nTHE RACE. REPUBLICANS RUNNING FOR SENATE\nAND CONGRESS DON'T FEEL DONALD TRUMP IS LIFTING THEM UP IN\nPURPLE STATES. >> THEY THINKNOT, HS FOR LACK\nOF A BETTER TERM, TANKING THE TICKET AS MUCH AS THEY THOUGHT\nTHAT HE WOULD. REMEMBER, THOSE FEARS WERE\nRAMPANT IN THE PRIMARY. >> THE HOPE FOR REPUBLICAN HOUSE\nAND SENATE CANDIDATES FOR AWHILE NOW REALLY SINCE THE FIRST\nDEBATE OR MAYBE EVEN SINCE LABOR DAY HAS NOT BEEN THAT TRUMP\nWOULD WIN THIS ELECTION. REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN VERY\nPESSIMISTIC ABOUT THAT FOR MONTHS NOW.\nIT'S THAT HE WOULD LOSE NARROWLY AND NARROWLY ENOUGH SO THAT\nREPUBLICANS LIKE PAT TOOMEY RUNNING FOR RE-ELECTION IN\nPENNSYLVANIA OR THE CANDIDATES WHO WERE MENTIONED IN THE ADS,\nTHEY WOULD BE ABLE TO OUTPERFORM THE NATIONAL TICKET AND GET\nACROSS THE FINISH LINE. IF TRUMP LOSES BY FOUR INSTEAD\nOF 12 AND YOU HAVE THESE ADS OUT THERE TELLING VOTERS JUST MAKE\nSURE TO GET OUT THERE AND VOTE FOR A REPUBLICAN HOUSE AND\nSENATE CANDIDATES AS A CHECK ON THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT, THAT'S\nSORT OF THE BEST CASE SCENARIO, BEST CASE REALISTIC SCENARIO A\nLOT OF REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN IMAGINING.\n>> I BROUGHT UP THE MONEY. LET'S GET BACK TO THAT.\nHILLARY CLINTON GOT A LOT OF IT AND DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T.\nTHEN THERE'S THE ISSUE OF DONALD TRUMP SAID HE WOULD PUT $100\nMILLION OF HIS OWN MONEY INTO THE CAMPAIGN.\nHE HASN'T. HE'S GOT $56 MILLION.\nHE PUT $30,000 ONLY IN IN THE FIRST TWO WEEKS OF THIS MONTH.\nHILLARY CLINTON ACTUALLY PUT MORE OF HER OWN MONEY INTO HER\nCAMPAIGN. HIS KIDS HAVEN'T DONATED TO HIS\nCAMPAIGN. WHAT MESSAGE DOES THAT SOUND?\n>> TO MY LIBERAL FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES, IF YOU WANTED MONEY\nOUT OF POLITICS, WHO KNEW TRUMP WAS YOUR MAN.\nLOOK, THERE'S A HISTORIC LOW NUMBER OF TV ADS RUNNING,\nNEGATIVE ADS RUNNING ON TV BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T PUT MUCH\nMONEY INTO IT. THIS IS A VERY UNCONVENTIONAL\nRACE. YOU'RE RIGHT, THERE ARE PURPLE\nSTATES THAT TRHROW THE MAP INTO QUESTION BUT THE PROBLEM FOR\nREPUBLICANS HAS BEEN FOR SEVERAL CYCLES THE MAP IS TOUGH FOR\nTHEM. IT IS STILL TOUGH AND HE HAS TO\nNOT JUST WIN THE RED STATES THAT MITT ROMNEY AND McCAIN WON, BUT\nTURN SOME OF THE OTHER STATES. THERE'S PROMISE FOR DOING THAT\nBUT YOU HAVE TO RUN AN ALMOST PERFECT GAME AND TO LET THE\nBOTTOM FALL OUT OF FUND-RAISING WHEN YOU RELY ON THE RNC TO DO\nYOUR GET OUT THE VOTE BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE A CONVENTIONAL\nOPERATION, THAT'S A PROBLEM. YOU CAN'T RUN A PERFECT GAME\nTHAT WAY FOR THE NEXT 11 DAYS. >> NOT ONLY AN ALMOST PERFECT\nGAME. YOU HAVE TO RUN A PERFECT GAME\nIN ORDER TO RUN THE PATH HE HAS BEFORE HIM RIGHT NOW.\n>> YOU HAVE TO PLAY THE GAME. SOMETIMES TO PLAY THE GAME IT\nTAKES MONEY, RIGHT? YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING TO SPEND\nIT. >> YOU ALWAYS GET THE LAST WORD.\n>> YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M SORRY.\nI RETRACT MY COMMENT. STICK AROUND.\nA LOT MORE TO DISCUSS ABOUT MONEY, ABOUT OTHER THINGS AND\nALSO THIS. THE LAWYER WHO REPPED AL GORE IN\n2000 IS SAYING TO DONALD TRUMP SAVE YOUR BREATH, CHALLENGING AN\nELECTION IS NEAR IMPOSSIBLE.",

MAYBE EVEN A HOLY WOW.\nLAST NIGHT, DURING A SENATE DEBATE IN ILLINOIS, REPUBLICAN\nSENATOR MARK KIRK SEEMED TO QUESTION EVEN MOCK THE ANCESTRY\nOF HIS DEMOCRATIC CHALLENGER, CONGRESSWOMAN TAMMY DUCKWORTH.\n>> MY FAMILY HAS SERVED THIS NATION IN UNIFORM GOING BACK TO\nTHE REVOLUTION. I'M A DAUGHTER OF THE AMERICAN\nREVOLUTION. I HAVE BLED FOR THIS NATION.\n>> I HAD FORGOTTEN THAT YOUR PARENTS CAME ALL THE WAY FROM\nTHAILAND TO SERVE GEORGE WASHINGTON.\n>> ALL RIGHT. TAMMY DUCKWORTH WAS BORN IN\nTHAILAND. HER MOTHER IS OF CHINESE HER IJ\nT  -- HERITAGE.\n>> DUCKWORTH IS AN IRAQ WAR VETERAN AND PURPLE HEART\nRECIPIENT. THE BIG QUESTION HERE, IS DONALD\nTRUMP'S CAMPAIGN AND THE TOP OF THE TICKET COMING TO THE DEFENSE\nOF THIS DOWN BALLOT REPUBLICAN? NOT SO MUCH.\nHIS CAMPAIGN MANAGER KELLYANNE CONWAY TWEETED THIS.\nTHE SAME MARK KIRK THAT UNENDORSED HIS PARTY'S\nPRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE AND CALLED HIM OUT IN PAID ADS?\nGOT YOU. GOOD LUCK.\nTHAT'S FROM KELLYANNE CONWAY. LET'S BRING BACK THE PANEL.\nEMILY, YOU SEE THIS, YOU THINK WHAT?\n>> THAT IT ADDED A VERY STRANGE DYNAMIC IN THE PRESIDENTIAL AND\nDOWN BALLOT WHERE IT SEEMS OKAY TO BE QUESTIONING PEOPLE'S\nMILITARY SERVICE ACROSS THE BOARD.\nWE SAW IT WITH THE KHANS WITH TRUMP.\nTHIS IS THE SECOND TIME IT HAPPENED IN THE KIRK/DUCKWORTH\nRACE. VERY STRANGE DYNAMIC.\nIT'S ALSO HAPPENING IN MISSOURI IN THE SENATE RACE THERE.\nI THINK OF THE DYNAMIC BETWEEN CONWAY AND KIRK, WHAT WE ARE\nSEEING RIGHT NOW, IS WHEN VOTERS IN SWING STATES WHO HAVE THESE\nSENATE RACES UP FOR GRABS AS WELL ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT\nHOW TO BALANCE, DO THEY SHOW UP FOR TRUMP OR IF NOT, DO THEY\nSHOW UP FOR THE REPUBLICAN SENATORIAL CANDIDATE AND\nBASICALLY WHAT WE ARE SEEING RIGHT NOW IS THAT VOTERS WHO ARE\nUNSURE, REPUBLICANS THAT RUN SURE, FEEL LIKE ANYTHING THE\nREPUBLICAN DOES IS A POLITICAL TACTIC.\nIF THEY ENDORSE OR UNENDORSE THEY ARE DOING IT FOR POLITICS.\nTHAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE TO BALANCE.\n>> I HAD TO WATCH IT A FEW TIMES BECAUSE I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT\nTHE FIRST TIME I SAW IT. I'M NOT SURE IT REALLY HAD TO DO\nAS MUCH WITH MILITARY SERVICE AS JUST A STATEMENT THAT WAS\nPRACTICALLY FLAT OUT RACIST. I'M NOT EVEN SURE IT HAS TO DO\nWITH REPUBLICAN, DEMOCRAT OR ANYTHING OTHER THAN JUST IT WAS\nCRAZY. YOUR THOUGHTS?\n>> YEAH. ILLINOIS IS A SPECIAL CASE.\nTHESE ARE TWO OF THE ONLY POLITICIANS IN THAT STATE THAT I\nCAN THINK OF THAT HAVE NEVER HAD TO PROVE THEMSELVES IN THE\nPRISON YARD. SO THE FACT THAT HE SAID\nSOMETHING SPICY AT A DEBATE, I STILL THINK KEEPS HIM HEAD AND\nSHOULDERS ABOVE MOST OF HIS COLLEAGUES THERE.\nWE HAVE SEEN VERY STRANGE THINGS IN A LOT OF SENATE DEBATES THAT\nHAVE GONE ON THAT HAVE BEEN LARGELY IGNORED BECAUSE THE\nPRESIDENTIAL RACE SUCKED UP ALL THE AIR IN THE ROOM.\nHERE IN CALIFORNIA, LORETTA SANCHEZ DID A DAB AT HER DEBATE\nWITH KAMELA HARRIS WHICH WAS CERTAINLY REPORTED IN CALIFORNIA\nBUT DIDN'T GET MUCH ATTENTION ELSEWHERE.\n>> IT DID ON SOCIAL MEDIA. I WILL TELL YOU THAT MUCH.\nSTRANGE THINGS HAPPEN AT DEBATES I GUESS WE CAN SAY.\nTHERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF LIGHTING OF THE HAIR ON FIRE, I THINK YOU\nSAID YOU WERE LIGHTING IT -- >> IT'S STILL ON FIRE.\n>> DOES THAT FIT INTO THAT CATEGORY?\nTHIS IS DONALD TRUMP SPEAKING TO A CROWD ABOUT CANCELING THE\nELECTION. WATCH THIS.\n>> WE SHOULD JUST CANCEL THE ELECTION AND JUST GIVE IT TO\nTRUMP, RIGHT? WHAT DO WE EVEN HAVE -- WHAT ARE\nWE HAVING IT FOR? HER POLICIES ARE SO BAD.\nBOY, DO WE HAVE A BIG DIFFERENCE.\n>> FOR DONALD TRUMP AS -- NO SHOCKER HERE, HAS SAID A LOT OF\nTHINGS A LOT OF PEOPLE, THEIR EYES POPPING OUT OF THEIR HEADS.\nTHIS ONE WAS A JOKE. I THINK AT SOME POINT, WE SHOULD\nBE ABLE TO SAY HE TOLD A JOKE AND HE'S ALLOWED TO TELL A JOKE.\n>> SURE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE THINGS THAT\nTRUMP HAS SAID ABOUT THE ELECTORAL PROCESS OVER THE LAST\nCOUPLE WEEKS, TALKING OF RIGGED ELECTIONS, URGING SUPPORTERS TO\nGO INTO URBAN AREAS AND MONITOR YOU KNOW WHO AT THE POLLS.\n>> THAT WAS NO JOKE. >> THAT WAS NOT A JOKE.\nTHIS IS THE KIND OF THING YOU CAN IMAGINE MAYBE NOT THE MOST\nCONVENTIONAL CANDIDATE SAYING BUT CERTAINLY SOMEBODY WITHIN\nTHE MAINSTREAM OF AMERICAN SORT OF POLITICAL THEATER SAYING.\nI THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE AT THIS POINT ARE SO DESENSITIZED TO\nSOME OF THE NOT RED CARD LEVEL STUFF TRUMP SAYS BUT CERTAINLY\nTHE YELLOW CARD LEVEL STUFF HE SAYS.\nTHIS PROBABLY FALLS INTO THAT CATEGORY.\n>> EXCELLENT STALKER REFERENCE",

WHETHER WE CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT\nWHERE PEOPLE WILL FEEL LIKE TO DO SOMETHING OF VIOLENCE WOULD\nBE RECEIVED BY MANY OTHER OF THEIR PEERS AS HEROIC.\n>> SO ALICE, WHAT DO YOU THINK? BECAUSE WHEN SOME PEOPLE HEAR\nTHIS KIND OF RHETORIC, THEIR MIND AUTOMATICALLY GOES TO SOME\nSORT OF VIOLENCE. DO YOU THINK THAT WILL REALLY\nHAPPEN? >> I THINK THE PEOPLE WE JUST\nSHOWED ARE REFLECTIVE OF A VERY VERY SMALL FACET OF THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY. LOOK, I HAVE 100% COMPLETE\nCONFIDENCE IN THE ELECTION PROCESS.\nIT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT ELECTIONS ARE RUN STATE BY\nSTATE AND EACH STATE OVERSEES THEIR ELECTION PROCESS.\nI THINK IT WILL BE A FREE AND FAIR ELECTION.\nAT THE SAME TIME, I THINK TO THEIR CONCERNS, IF HILLARY\nCLINTON WERE TO WIN, I THINK THAT'S A RALLYING CRY TO\nREPUBLICANS AND HOPEFULLY WHETHER IT BE DONALD TRUMP OR\nREINCE PRIEBUS TO USE THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO RALLY THE\nREPUBLICANS TOGETHER AND REBUILD THE PARTY AND FOCUS ON WHAT WE\nARE GOING TO DO FOR THE MIDTERMS AND ALSO USE THIS AS ENCOURAGING\nREPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS TO BE A CHECK AND BALANCE IF HILLARY\nCLINTON WERE TO WIN, AND NOT TO USE IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR\nVIOLENCE. I THINK THOSE PEOPLE ARE A VERY\nSMALL VOICE IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\n>> WELL, YOU KNOW, MARIA, EVERYBODY THOUGHT THERE WAS\nGOING TO BE VIOLENCE AT THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION.\nTHERE WAS NO VIOLENCE. I WAS THERE.\nI SAW THE PROTESTERS. THEY DIDN'T HAVE VIOLENCE ON\nTHEIR MINDS. SO THIS MIGHT JUST BE TALK.\n>> WELL, LET'S HOPE SO, RIGHT? I AGREE WITH ALICE THAT I DO\nTHINK IT'S A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE.\nI'M GLAD SHE IS SAYING SHE IS 100% CONFIDENT IN OUR ELECTORAL\nPROCESS. I KNOW MANY REPUBLICANS HAVE\nSAID THAT AND REPUDIATED DONALD TRUMP'S IRRESPONSIBLE TALK OF A\nRIGGED SYSTEM. BUT LET'S ALSO ADMIT HERE THAT\nDONALD TRUMP'S RHETORIC HAS FED INTO THE KIND OF LANGUAGE THAT\nWE ARE SEEING FROM THE SMALL PERCENTAGE OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS.\nIT HAS FED INTO THE KIND OF PASSION THAT THEY FEEL ABOUT HIS\nWINNING AND ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THEIR UNFORTUNATE FEELINGS ABOUT\nHILLARY CLINTON. BUT I THINK AT THE END OF THE\nDAY, I AM GOING TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN NOT JUST THE\nELECTORAL PROCESS BUT IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT THEY WILL\nUNDERSTAND AND KNOW THAT THE DEMOCRACY THAT WE HAVE HERE IN\nTHIS COUNTRY IS SOMETHING TO BE VALUED OVER EVERYTHING BUT\nDONALD TRUMP HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO RACHET DOWN\nTHE RHETORIC OF RIGGED ELECTIONS, TO RACHET DOWN THE\nRHETORIC OF LOCK HER UP, TO RACHET DOWN THE RHETORIC OF\nINCITING VIOLENCE AT HIS OWN RALLIES AND FOCUS ON MAKING SURE\nTHAT WHATEVER TRANSITION HAPPENS, THAT IT IS SMOOTH.\n>> RIGHT. OKAY.\nSO THERE'S A TINY SIGN THAT AT LEAST TRUMP'S RUNNING MATE MIKE\nPENCE IS CONCERNED, BECAUSE HE CAME FACE TO FACE WITH AN IOWA\nVOTER WHO HAD SOME VERY STRONG COMMENTS ABOUT A POSSIBLE TRUMP\nLOSS AND HERE'S HOW HE RESPONDED.\n>> I DON'T WANT THIS TO HAPPEN BUT I WILL TELL YOU FROM ME\nPERSONALLY, IF HILLARY CLINTON GETS IN, I MYSELF, I'M READY FOR\nA REVOLUTION BECAUSE WE CAN'T HAVE HER IN.\n>> YEAH. YOU DON'T -- DON'T SAY THAT.\n>> I'M JUST SAYING IT. NO, I'M LIKE TRUMP.\nAM I NOT SAYING THE TRUTH, GUYS? COME ON.\n>> THERE'S A REVOLUTION COMING ON NOVEMBER 8th.\nI PROMISE YOU. >> SO JASON, MIKE PENCE APPEARS\nTO BE TRYING TO TAMP DOWN EMOTION.\n>> I THINK TO BE FAIR, YOU HAVE TO SAY THERE ARE PEOPLE ON BOTH\nSIDES WHO ARE SAYING THE OPPOSING CANDIDATE IS A THREAT\nTO DEMOCRACY. THAT'S THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE\nARE IN RIGHT NOW. AND ALSO FEEDING INTO THIS ARE\nTHE DAILY WIKILEAKS INFORMATION THAT'S COMING, THAT'S RAISING\nPEOPLE'S CONCERN ABOUT THE CORRUPT WASHINGTON WAYS AND\nTHEY'RE JUST CONFUSED. I THINK MANY PEOPLE, WHERE DO\nYOU CHANNEL THAT IF YOU END UP LOSING THE ELECTION.\n>> THAT BRINGS UP SAY HILLARY CLINTON DOES WIN THE ELECTION,\nALICE, HOW DO YOU GOVERN IN THAT KIND OF CLIMATE WHEN THERE'S A\nCERTAIN SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION WHO THINKS YOU'RE A\nCROOK, RIGHT, AND THEN THERE'S A CERTAIN SEGMENT OF THE\nPOPULATION WHO JUST DOESN'T LIKE OR TRUST YOU?\n>> WELL, REGARDLESS OF WHO IT IS, IT'S GOING TO BE A DIFFICULT\nTIME. CLEARLY DONALD TRUMP HAS TAPPED\nINTO TREMENDOUS FRUSTRATION AMONGST MANY VOTERS AND HE'S\nGIVEN THEM A VOICE TO SPEAK OUT AND SPEAK THEIR MIND IN THIS\nELECTION. AND REGARDLESS OF WHO IT IS,\nWITH ALL OF THE ANGER AND THE EMOTION SURROUNDING THIS\nELECTION, IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT FOR THEM LEADING AND I\nHOPE THAT WHOEVER IT IS, WHETHER IT'S DONALD TRUMP OR HILLARY\nCLINTON, GIVEN ALL THE INFORMATION WE HAVE COMING OUT\nABOUT BOTH OF THEM OVER THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS AND MONTHS, THAT\nTHEY DO BRING ABOUT NEW LEADERSHIP IN THIS COUNTRY THAT\nIS MORE BIPARTISAN. I DON'T THINK BARACK OBAMA HAS\nDONE A GOOD JOB OF BRINGING BOTH SIDES TOGETHER AND WORKING FOR A\nCONSENSUS ON MANY, MANY ISSUES. WHETHER IT'S DONALD TRUMP OR\nHILLARY CLINTON, I HOPE WE SEE SOME TYPE OF LEADERSHIP THAT\nHELPS TO BRIDGE THE DIVIDE WHICH HAS BEEN SO GREAT IN THIS\nELECTION BECAUSE WE NEED TO SEE THIS COUNTRY COMING TOGETHER.\n>> MARIA, I THINK THAT MANY PEOPLE AGREE WITH ALICE BUT THEY\nDON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING WITH EITHER CANDIDATE.\n>> WELL, I WILL SAY THIS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON HAD GOING FOR HER IN THE SENATE AND MANY REPUBLICANS HAVE\nSAID THIS IS THAT SHE REALLY DID HAVE THE ABILITY TO WORK ACROSS\nTHE AISLE AND MANY REPUBLICAN SENATORS WILL SAY THAT AND STILL\nDO SAY THAT TO THIS DAY. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SHE HAS\nBEEN TALKING ABOUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\nSHE'S THE ONE WHO IS TALKING ABOUT BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER.\nSHE IS THE ONE WHOSE SLOGAN IS STRONGER TOGETHER, MAKING SURE\nWE LIFT EACH OTHER UP INSTEAD OF TEARING EACH OTHER DOWN.\nSO AGAIN, THE CANDIDATES' RHETORIC REALLY DOES MATTER AND\nTRUMP IS THE ONE WHO HAS FOCUSED ON SPLITTING US.\nHE'S THE ONE WHO HAS TALKED ABOUT RIGGED ELECTIONS.\nHE'S EVEN TALKED IN A NOT SO NUANCED WAY ABOUT QUOTE, SECOND\nAMENDMENT PEOPLE TAKING CARE OF HILLARY CLINTON IF SHE'S\nELECTED. THAT IS NOT THE KIND OF RHETORIC\nTHAT WE NEED HERE. THIS IS A MOMENT WHERE YOUR\nLEADERSHIP SKILLS REALLY ARE EITHER VISIBLE OR PEOPLE\nUNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE UNFIT TO LEAD.\n>> HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE.",

IT'S A BIT JARRING TO THINK THAT\nJUST 45 YEARS AGO, THIS WAS ACTUALLY HAPPENING IN MAJOR\nAMERICAN NEWSROOMS. >> THAT WAS ME.\nHE DID WRITE A COURT STORY. I REWROTE IT.\n>> GIRLS DO NOT DO REWRITES. >> WHY NOT?\n>> THAT'S SIMPLY HOW WE DO THINGS HERE.\nWE HAVE RULES, PROTOCOL. >> THOSE RULES ARE DUMB.\nIF COPY'S GOOD, IT'S GOOD. >> THAT'S A CLIP FROM THE NEW\nAMAZON SERIES \"GOOD GIRLS REVOLT.\"\nIT'S FICTION BUT BASED ON THE REAL STORY OF 46 WOMEN WHO SUED\n\"NEWSWEEK\" FOR SEX DISCRIMINATION IN 1970.\nLYNN POVICH WAS ONE OF THOSE WOMEN, AND AUTHOR OF THE BOOK\nTHE NEW SERIES IS BASED ON. \"THE GOOD GIRLS REVOLT, HOW THE\nWOMEN OF NEWSWEEK SUED THEIR BOSSES AND CHANGED THE\nWORKPLACE.\" NICE TO HAVE YOU HERE.\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT SCENE, WHAT GOES THROUGH YOUR MIND?\n>> YOU KNOW, WE WERE TOLD STRAIGHT OUT IF YOU WANT TO\nWRITE GO SOME PLACE ELSE. WOMEN DON'T WRITE AT \"NEWSWEEK.\"\nSO PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO WRITE ACTUALLY LEFT VERY EARLY, WAY\nBEFORE THIS SERIES TAKES PLACE BECAUSE SHE KNEW SHE WANTED TO\nBE A WRITER AND WOULDN'T GET PROMOTED.\n>> BUT THERE WERE OTHER WOMEN IN THE NEWSROOM LIKE YOU WHO FOUGHT\nTHE GOOD FIGHT. BUT STILL, IT MUST HAVE TAKEN A\nLOT OF COURAGE TO LAUNCH THIS LAWSUIT AGAINST \"NEWSWEEK.\"\n>> IT DID. IT WAS ALSO A MATTER OF WHEN WE\nRO REALIZED IT WAS ILLEGAL.\nFOR SOME REASON FIVE YEARS AFTER THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT WE DIDN'T\nREALIZE IT WAS ILLEGAL TO SEGREGATE JOBS BY GENDER.\nI THINK THAT MOTIVATED A LOT OF US.\nIT'S NOT JUST BAD, IT'S ACTUALLY ILLEGAL.\nWE DID ORGANIZE AND HAD TO DO IT SECRETLY BECAUSE WE WERE AFRAID\nOF GETTING FIRED AT ANY MOMENT. >> EVEN IF THE LAWSUIT WAS\nSUCCESSFUL THERE'S A CHANCE YOU WOULD STILL LOSE YOUR JOB,\nRIGHT? >> THEY CAN'T FIRE YOU AFTER YOU\nFILE SUIT BUT THEY CAN CERTAINLY FREEZE YOU OUT.\nUNFORTUNATELY, IT HAPPENED TO TOO MANY WOMEN.\n>> WE WERE LOOKING AT PICTURES OF YOU FROM WHEN YOU WORKED\nTHERE. YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS READING\nABOUT THIS AND WATCHING PARTS OF THE NEW SERIES, IT BROUGHT ME\nBACK TO 1983 WHEN I STARTED MY CAREER.\nI STARTED IN A TINY TOWN IN OHIO.\nI THINK I WAS THE FIRST FEMALE ANCHOR THAT STATION EVER HAD AND\nOF COURSE, I WAS ON THE WEEKENDS AND I ALSO HAD TO DO THE WEATHER\nAND I ALSO PRODUCED THE NEWSCAST AND I WAS VERY LOW PAID.\nI THINK THAT WOMEN STILL SUFFER FROM LOWER WAGES THAN MEN EVEN\nTODAY, AND THAT'S SOMETHING DIFFICULT FOR YOUNGER WOMEN TO\nFATHOM. >> IT IS.\nWOMEN ARE STILL LEARNING HOW TO NEGOTIATE FOR THEMSELVES BECAUSE\nTHEY ARE PENALIZED IF THEY ARE TOO TOUGH, THEY ARE PENALIZED.\nIF THEY GO IN WITH LOWER SALARIES IT AFFECTS THEIR SALARY\nFOR THE REST OF THEIR LIFE. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO LEARN\nHOW TO NEGOTIATE. >> LET'S TALK A LITTLE ABOUT\nHISTORY. HILLARY CLINTON IS THE FIRST\nWOMAN WHO WAS NOMINATED BY A MAJOR PARTY IN THE UNITED STATES\nAND YOU DO HEAR A LOT OF WOMEN SAY WE ARE GLAD THAT A WOMAN WAS\nNOMINATED BUT WHY DID IT HAVE TO BE THIS WOMAN.\n>> WELL, YOU KNOW, I THINK IN HILLARY'S DEFENSE, HILLARY HAS\nFOUGHT FOR THE ISSUES THAT WOMEN REALLY CARE ABOUT FOR A LONG\nTIME. JOE BIDEN SAID WHEN SHE WAS EVEN\nBEFORE PUBLIC OFFICE, SHE WAS WORKING ON WOMEN'S ISSUES, ON\nFAMILY ISSUES, ON REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES AND ALL THE THINGS THAT\nMANY OF US CARE A LOT ABOUT, AND THAT ARE NEVER RAISED IN\nPRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS. SO I GIVE HER A LOT OF CREDIT.\nI THINK OBAMA WAS RIGHT WHEN HE SAID SHE'S THE MOST QUALIFIED\nPERSON IN THE RACE. >> SOME OF THE NAMES SHE'S BEING\nCALLED, SHE'S BEING CALLED A CROOK, A LOT OF PEOPLE CHANT\n\"LOCK HER UP\" AND I THINK THAT MORE WOMEN DON'T ENTER THE WORLD\nOF POLITICS BECAUSE THEY DON'T REALLY WANT TO DEAL WITH THAT.\n>> YEAH. IT'S STILL A PROBLEM FOR WOMEN\nAND WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT SEXUAL ASSAULT WOULD DOMINATE\nOUR CONVERSATION IN A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION?\nSO ON THE ONE HAND, IT'S HORRIBLE AND HORRIFYING TO SEE\nTHAT IT STILL EXISTS. ON THE OTHER HAND, I DO THINK\nTHE SILVER LINING IS THIS MADE A LOT OF WOMEN MAD, PARTICULARLY\nYOUNGER WOMEN WHO MAY NOT HAVE WANTED TO BE CALLED FEMINISTS.\nTHEY GET IT. THEY ARE REALLY ANGRY NOW.\n>> SO IF THIS ELECTION DOES BOIL DOWN TO WOMEN VERSUS MEN AND\nWOMEN VOTERS REALLY DO DECIDE THE ELECTION, WHAT DOES THAT SAY\nABOUT WOMEN IN AMERICA? >> I THINK IT'S NOT JUST WOMEN\nVERSUS MEN. I THINK A LOT OF MEN WILL VOTE\nFOR HILLARY AS WELL. CERTAINLY DONALD TRUMP HAS SOME\nWOMEN SUPPORTERS. BUT I THINK FOR THE WHOLE\nCOUNTRY, WE ARE AT A VERY DIVISIVE POINT BETWEEN WHETHER\nYOU CALL THEM REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS OR MEN AND WOMEN, IT'S\nA VERY VOLATILE TIME. BUT YOU KNOW, I HAVE MY\nCONFIDENCE IN THE YOUNGER GENERATION AND I THINK YOUNGER\nMEN ACTUALLY GET IT AND WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN RAISING THEIR\nCHILDREN AND HAVE HAD NOT ONLY SISTERS BUT CO-ED ROOMMATES.\nI THINK THIS GENERATION OF MEN IS GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.\n>> LYNN POVICH, THANK YOU SO MUCH.\nAPPRECIATE YOU BEING WITH ME.",

HE OBVIOUSLY HAS A LOT OF STAR\nPOWER BUT SECRETARY CLINTON HAS A LOT OF STAR POWER IN HER OWN\nRIGHT AS FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE AND ALSO I THINK THEY HAVE\nDISAGREED ON MANY AVENUES OF FOREIGN POLICY IN THE PAST SUCH\nAS IRAQ, SUCH AS AFGHANISTAN, THE CONFLICT IN SYRIA.\nSECRETARY CLINTON HAS PROPOSED A LITTLE BIT OF AE ROBUST\nMILITARY PRESENCE. SO NOT NECESSARILY SURE HE'S THE\nMOST NATURAL PICK BUT CERTAINLY ON A LIST OF POSSIBLE\nCANDIDATES. >> ALL RIGHT.\nTHANK YOU, ELISE. CLINTON MAY BE LOOKING\nPOST-ELECTION BUT THERE ARE STILL 11 DAYS TO GO.\nDONALD TRUMP ISN'T SLOWING DOWN HIS RIGGED ELECTION TALK,\nEITHER. CNN'S JASON CARROLL JOINS ME\nWITH MORE ON THAT. >> HE'S NOT GOING TO BACK DOWN\nWITH THESE UNSUBSTANTIATED CLAIMS.\nTHIS IS SOMETHING HE IS PROBABLY GOING TO TALK ABOUT UP UNTIL THE\nVERY END. HE MENTIONED THIS IN AN\nINTERVIEW YESTERDAY. HE TALKED ABOUT A SITUATION, AN\nALLEGED INCIDENT IN TEXAS WHERE HE SAYS A WOMAN VOTED FOR HIM\nBUT WHEN SHE LOOKED AT HER BALLOT SHE SAYS IT WAS CAST FOR\nSOMEBODY ELSE. LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID JUST LAST\nNIGHT. >> YOU LOOK AT TEXAS, A LOT OF\nCALLS WERE MADE FROM TEXAS, AN INCREDIBLE PRALACE, I LOVE TEXA.\nTHE LINES ARE MASSIVE AND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT FRLIPPING,\nWHERE THEY PRESS A BUTTON FOR ME AND ANOTHER NAME COMES UP.\n>> DO WE HAVE ANY DATA, ANY FACTS ON THAT?\n>> NO, THEY JUST CALL IN. >> SO THE TEXAS OFFICIAL WHO IS\nIN CHARGE OF THAT PARTICULAR AREA WHERE THAT ALLEGED INCIDENT\nTOOK PLACE, SHANNON LACKEY IS THE ELECTION ADMINISTRATOR FOR\nRANDALL COUNTY, TEXAS. HERE'S WHAT -- THE STATEMENT\nTHAT CAME OUT FOR THAT. ABSOLUTELY NOT.\nIT IS NOT HAPPENING IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM.\nI STAND 100% BEHIND WHAT I DO. I STAND BEHIND MY MACHINES, MY\nSTAFF. AGAIN, THAT COMING FROM SHANNON\nLACKEY, THE ELECTION ADMINISTRATOR FROM RANDALL\nCOUNTY, TEXAS. ALSO, WE SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT\nTHAT THE FIRST LADY WAS OUT CAMPAIGNING FOR CLINTON.\nTHIS ALSO HAPPENING YESTERDAY. THERE'S BEEN SOME TALK OF VOTER\nSUPPRESSION BY THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN ALLEGEDLY TRYING TO SUPPRESS THE VOTERS OF\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS AND YOUNG WOMEN.\nTHE FIRST LADY SPEAKING OUT ABOUT THAT JUST YESTERDAY.\n>> SO WHEN YOU HEAR FOLKS TALKING ABOUT A GLOBAL\nCONSPIRACY AND SAYING THAT THIS ELECTION IS RIGGED, UNDERSTAND\nTHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO GET YOU TO STAY HOME.\nTHEY ARE TRYING TO CONVINCE YOU THAT YOUR VOTE DOESN'T MATTER,\nTHAT THE OUTCOME HAS ALREADY BEEN DETERMINED AND YOU\nSHOULDN'T EVEN BOTHER MAKING YOUR VOICE HEARD.\nTHEY ARE TRYING TO TAKE AWAY YOUR HOPE.\n>> IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT A NUMBER OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS THAT\nI HAVE SPOKEN TO REALLY DO BELIEVE WHAT TRUMP IS SAYING.\nTHEY DO BELIEVE THAT THIS ELECTION IS SOMEHOW RIGGED IN\nSOME WAY, SHAPE OR FORM, ONCE AGAIN EVEN THOUGH THERE IS NO\nEVIDENCE FOR THAT. BUT AGAIN, THESE TWO CANDIDATES\nARE GOING TO BE BATTLING UNTIL THE VERY VERY LAST MOMENT.\nTRUMP FOR HIS PART IS GOING TO BE OUT IN PLACES LIKE IOWA.\nHE'S GOING TO BE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.\nHE'S GOING TO BE IN MAINE, MAKING THREE STOPS.\nTRUMP -- CLINTON FOR HER PART, SHE'S NOT GIVING UP ON IOWA,\nEITHER, MAKING TWO STOPS THERE. THE PRESIDENT WILL BE\nCAMPAIGNING FOR HER TODAY IN FLORIDA.\n>> JASON, THANKS SO MUCH. LET'S TALK ABOUT ALL OF THIS.\nBECAUSE THERE IS A LOT TO TALK ABOUT THIS MORNING.\nWITH ME, JACKIE KUCINICH, POLITICAL ANALYST AND WASHINGTON\nBUREAU CHIEF OF THE DAILY BEAST AND DAVID SWORDLICH, ASSISTANT\nEDITOR AT \"THE WASHINGTON POST.\" LET'S START WITH JOE BIDEN.\nSO SOMEBODY WITHIN THE CLINTON CAMP FLOATED JOE BIDEN'S NAME\nOUT THERE. ANY IDEA WHAT THE REASON IS?\n>> I MEAN, THIS DOES SEEM LIKE A TRIAL BALLOON.\nI THINK ELISE HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD.\nTHERE'S A LONG LIST OF PEOPLE AND YOU DO START, THIS IS VERY\nCOMMON AT THIS STAGE OF THE CAMPAIGN, YOU DO START HEARING\nNAMES OF PEOPLE THAT WILL BE IN POSITIONS OF POWER.\nJOE BIDEN HAS CAMPAIGNED VERY HARD FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nHAS REALLY PUT HIMSELF OUT THERE FOR HER.\nAND THE CLINTONS REALLY LIKE LOYALTY SO IT'S NOT COMPLETELY\nOUT OF THE REALM OF POSSIBILITY, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE PROBABLY A LOT\nOF PEOPLE ARE BEING VETTED AT THIS POINT FOR THOSE SENIOR\nPOSITIONS IN THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION SHOULD HILLARY\nCLINTON WIN. >> SO YOU KNOW WHAT SOME PEOPLE\nARE GOING TO SAY, THEY ARE GOING TO SAY WELL, SHE'S ALREADY\nNAMING HER CABINET POSITIONS, THIS IS KIND OF ARROGANT.\nOTHER PEOPLE WILL SAY YOU KNOW WHAT, FLOATING JOE BIDEN'S NAME\nOUT THERE MIGHT ATTRACT BLUE COLLAR VOTERS HILLARY CLINTON\nNEEDS TO WIN THE ELECTION. >> YEAH.\nTHERE IS A CERTAIN SEGMENT THAT REALLY LIKES JOE BIDEN.\nI AGREE WITH JACKIE THAT THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF AN OUTSIDE THE\nBOX PICK BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS THE FORMER CHAIR OF THE\nSENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE AND THE CURRENT VICE\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SO HE CERTAINLY HAS THE RESUME.\nYEAH, THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN DOES NOT WANT TO GET TOO FAR AHEAD OF\nITSELF BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I THINK LIKE JACKIE SAID, THIS IS\nA TRIAL BALLOON OF A KNOWN FIGURE, SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN OUT\nON THE TRAIL FOR CLINTON IN THE PAST FEW DAYS SO I'M NOT\nCOMPLETELY SURPRISED. >> SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS\nNOTION OF A RIGGED ELECTION. YOU HEARD WHAT MICHELLE OBAMA IS\nSAYING. SHE SAYS DONALD TRUMP IS SAYING\nTHIS TO SUPPRESS THE VOTE. WHAT IS THE STRATEGY THERE?\n>> YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING STRATEGY BECAUSE MOST VOTERS ARE\nSEEING IN POLLS THE LAST COUPLE DAYS DON'T NECESSARILY BELIEVE\nTHIS. PR\n'TRUMP VOTERS TEND TO BELIEVE IT MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE.\nTHE INTERESTING THING IS YOU DO SEE A DISCONNECT BETWEEN WHAT\nDONALD TRUMP IS SAYING AND WHAT HIS RUNNING MATE IS SAYING, MIKE\nPENCE. HE SAID THIS MORNING HE BELIEVES\nIN THE SYSTEM. ALSO, PARTICULARLY WITH THIS\nTEXAS ARGUMENT, TEXAS IS RUN BY REPUBLICANS.\nTHE GOVERNOR IS REPUBLICAN, THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR IS\nREPUBLICAN, SECRETARY OF STATE IS REPUBLICAN.\nTHE IDEA THAT EVERYONE WOULD BE COLLUDING TO ELECT HILLARY\nCLINTON IS A LITTLE BEYOND THE REALM.\n>> JUST GOING MORE ALONG THOSE LINES, BECAUSE NO SYSTEM IS\nPERFECT, RIGHT? THERE'S GOING TO BE MISTAKES\nMADE. THERE'S MISTAKES MADE BUT THEY\nARE USUALLY CAUGHT AND THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT THERE'S\nWIDESPREAD FRAUD IN ANY STATE IN AMERICA WHEN IT COMES TO GOING\nTO THE POLLS AND VOTING. BUT GOING BACK TO TEXAS,\nJACKIE'S RIGHT, HAS A REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR, REPUBLICAN SECRETARY\nOF STATE, BOTH U.S. SENATORS ARE REPUBLICAN, 25 TEXAS REPUBLICANS\nWERE ELECTED TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES INCLUDING MANY\nTRUMP SUPPORTERS. SO IT DEFIES LOGIC, DOESN'T IT?\n>> WELL, LOOK, THE ALLEGATIONS OR THE CONCERNS SHOULD BE LOOKED\nINTO AND THE TEXAS OFFICIALS APPARENTLY DID LOOK INTO IT AND\nSAID THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.\nBUT YEAH, AS YOU SAY, TEXAS IS RUN BY REPUBLICANS SO IT WOULD\nBE HARD TO IMAGINE THE FIX IS IN FOR A DEMOCRAT.\nLOOK, WE HAVE A 50-STATE REPUBLIC HERE.\nEVERY STATE, EVERY COUNTY RUNS IT A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY.\nEVERY CONCERN ABOUT IRREGULARITIES SHOULD BE\nEVALUATED BUT WHEN TRUMP IS MAKING THIS ARGUMENT THAT\nTHERE'S A SYSTEMIC FIX IN FOR SECRETARY CLINTON MY RESPONSE TO\nTHAT IS SIMPLY SHOW US THE EVIDENCE.\nHE MADE THIS POINT ON BILL O'REILLY LAST NIGHT, NOT JUST\nSAYING THAT THERE'S VOTER FRAUD HERE OR THERE BUT THAT THE\nWHOLE -- HE'S GONE AND SAID THIS THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS, THAT IT'S\nNOT THE SPECIFIC STATES THAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT, IT'S THAT\nIT'S THE SYSTEM, THE MEDIA AND THE POLITICAL CLASS BUT HE'S\nOFFERED NO EVIDENCE AND AS I HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR THE PAST\nSEVERAL DAYS, LOOK, TRUMP CAMPAIGN, YOU KNOW, THE MEDIA\nHAS COVERED THIS CAMPAIGN CLOSELY FOR A YEAR AND A HALF.\nTHERE'S PLENTY OF INFORMATION OUT THERE ABOUT DONALD TRUMP,\nABOUT SECRETARY CLINTON, FOR VOTERS TO MAKE AN INFORMED\nCHOICE IN THIS RACE. THINGS HAVE NOT BEEN HIDDEN IN\nTHIS RACE. IT'S BEEN CLOSELY COVERED AND\nVOTERS WILL HAVE THEIR SAY IN A FEW DAYS.\n>> YOU KNOW, I'M WITH YOU. I DON'T THINK VOTERS ARE STUPID.\nI THINK THEY CAN MAKE UP THEIR OWN MINDS.\nTO ASSUME THAT WE ARE FORCE-FEEDING THEM THINGS AND\nBRAINWASHING THEM IN SOME WAY IS A DISSERVICE TO AMERICAN VOTERS,\nIN MY MIND. I WILL LEAVE IT THERE.\nTHANKS SO MUCH.",

MARCO RUBIO RUNNING FOR\nRE-ELECTION IN FLORIDA, IN AN AWKWARD SPOT ON DONALD TRUMP.\nSUPPORTING HIS CANDIDACY BUT REFUSING TO EVEN SAY THAT TRUMP\nWOULD KEEP THE COUNTRY SAFE. >> HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU THAT\nDONALD TRUMP WOULD BE A GOOD COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND KEEP THIS\nCOUNTRY SAFE? DO YOU THINK THAT --\n>> I HAVE DEEP CONCERNS ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON.\n>> WOULD DONALD TRUMP KEEP THE COUNTRY SAFE?\n>> THE MILITARY IS WHAT KEEPS US SAFE.\nWE HAVE TO REBUILD OUR MILITARY. >> Reporter: HE ALSO WOULD NOT\nSAY IF TRUMP COULD BE CONSIDERED A ROLE MODEL FOR HIS FOUR\nCHILDREN. >> LIKE MOST AMERICANS, PEOPLE\nLOOK AT THIS AND SAY THESE ARE NOT IDEAL CHOICES BUT THAT'S WHY\nONE OF THE REASONS I RAN FOR SENATE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT NO\nMATTER WHO WINS WE HAVE TO HAVE A STRONG SENATE.\n>> Reporter: RUBIO FACES A DILEMMA THAT'S CONFRONTING\nSENATE GOP CANDIDATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY.\nTHEY NEED THE SUPPORT OF TRUMP BACKERS TO WIN RE-ELECTION AND\nALSO TO WIN OVER VOTERS WHO FEEL ALIENATED BY THE GOP NOMINEE.\nYET IF TRUMP GETS BLOWN OUT BY CLINTON, IT WOULD DRAMATICALLY\nIMPROVE THE CHANCES OF A DEMOCRATIC SENATE TAKEOVER.\nRECENT POLLS IN FLORIDA MAKE THAT CASE.\nONE FOUND CLINTON AHEAD OF TRUMP AND RUBIO BARELY LEADING HIS\nDEMOCRATIC CHALLENGER, CONGRESSMAN PATRICK MURPHY.\nA SEPARATE POLL HAD TRUMP AHEAD AND RUBIO WINNING RE-ELECTION BY\nTEN POINTS. WHAT MAKES THINGS MORE\nUNCOMFORTABLE FOR RUBIO, HIS BITTER PRIMARY FIGHT WITH TRUMP.\n>> WE HAVE A CON ARTIST AS THE FRONT-RUNNER IN THE REPUBLICAN\nPARTY. >> Reporter: IN A DEBATE THIS\nWEEK, MURPHY MADE HIS STRATEGY ABUNDANTLY CLEAR.\nCONSISTENTLY INVOKING TRUMP'S NAME.\n>> DONALD TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP. >> WHAT'S IT GOING TO TAKE FOR\nYOU TO UNENDORSE DONALD TRUMP? >> THE ANSWER TO EVERY QUESTION\nTONIGHT BY CONGRESSMAN MURPHY IS DONALD TRUMP.\n>> Reporter: BUT MURPHY, AFTER BEING ABANDONED BY THE NATIONAL\nPARTY, NOW GETTING A LAST MINUTE CASH INFUSION WITH A SUPER PAC\nTIED TO DEMOCRATIC LEADER HARRY REID, PROMISING TO MAKE A\nSEVEN-FIGURE DONATION TO AN OUTSIDE GROUP TIED TO MURPHY.\nMURPHY ALREADY PUTTING $1 MILLION OF HIS OWN MONEY TO PAY\nFOR THIS SPANISH LANGUAGE AD WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA.\nHOW BADLY DOES OBAMA WANT TO BEAT MARCO RUBIO?\nHE'S COMING HERE TODAY TO CAMPAIGN FOR HILLARY CLINTON AND\nHE WILL ALSO BE WITH PATRICK MURPHY IN ORLANDO.\nTHIS AFTER OBAMA CALLING OUT RUBIO FOR ENDORSING DONALD\nTRUMP. NOW, THIS STATE IS GOING TO BE\nVERY DIFFICULT FOR DEMOCRATS TO PICK UP IN THE SENATE BECAUSE\nIT'S JUST SO EXPENSIVE. THERE ARE MORE WINNABLE STATES\nOUT THERE AND THAT'S WHERE THE DEMOCRATIC MONEY IS, OTHER\nSTATES LIKE MISSOURI, NORTH CAROLINA AND INDIANA.\nOTHER SWING STATES AS WELL. THAT COULD BE ONE REASON WHY\nMARCO RUBIO ENDS UP BEING RE-ELECTED.\n>> ALL RIGHT. MANU RAJU, MANY THANKS.\nWILL THE DEMOCRATS' EFFORTS PAY OFF AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET AND\nFOR DOWN BALLOT CANDIDATES? WITH ME, CNN EXECUTIVE POLITICS\nEDITOR MARK PRESTON. I MUST SAY, JUST LOOKING AT\nMARCO RUBIO, HE DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE HAVING MUCH FUN.\n>> WELL, WHAT'S INTERESTING IS MANU HAS SAID HE WAS GOING TO\nLEAVE THE UNITED STATES SENATE. HE DIDN'T SEEM TO REALLY ENJOY\nBEING IN THE U.S. SENATE. FOR WHATEVER REASON, PERHAPS\nCAJOLING BY REPUBLICAN LEADERS, HE DID DECIDE TO GET BACK IN THE\nRACE. MANU IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, IF IT\nWAS ANYONE ELSE ON THE REPUBLICAN TICKET RIGHT NOW,\nTHAT SEAT WOULD GO DEMOCRAT. RIGHT NOW, RUBIO IS FAVORED.\n>> SO THERE'S NOTHING THE DEMOCRATS CAN DO SHOULD I GUESS\nHARRY ROAD WAS BEHIND THIS INFLUX OF MONEY THAT'S COMING\nIN. IS HE WASTING HIS MONEY AND\nTIME? >> NO.\nI WOULDN'T SAY HE'S WASTING HIS MONEY BECAUSE LOOK, IF ALL OF A\nSUDDEN YOU SEE AN AMAZING WAVE COME ACROSS THE COUNTRY, YOU CAN\nSEE THE LIKES OF MARCO RUBIO GET KNOCKED OUT IN AN ANTI-TRUMP\nWAVE. WHAT WE ARE SEEING THE PAST\nCOUPLE DAYS, ESPECIALLY IN FLORIDA, IS THAT POLLS ARE\nTIGHTENING BETWEEN TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON AS MANU POINTED\nOUT AND MARCO RUBIO IS A WELL-KNOWN NAME IN FLORIDA.\nHE DOESN'T HAVE VERY HIGH UNFAVORABLES.\nHE'S WORKING IT. >> THERE ARE OTHER RACES GOING\nON, ESPECIALLY ONE IN ILLINOIS. IT GOT QUITE NASTY DURING A\nDEBATE. TAMMY DUCKWORTH WHO LOST HER\nLEGS IN IRAQ WAS DEBATING HER REPUBLICAN CHALLENGER MARK KIRK.\nHERE'S HOW IT WENT DOWN. >> MY FAMILY HAS SERVED THIS\nNATION IN UNIFORM GOING BACK THROUGH THE REVELATION.\nI'M A DAUGHTER OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION.\nI HAVE BLED FOR THIS NATION. BUT I STILL WANT TO BE THERE IN\nTHE SENATE WHEN THE DRUMS OF WAR SOUND BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE QUICK\nTO SOUND THE DRUMS OF WAR AND I WANT TO BE THERE TO SAY THIS IS\nWHAT IT COSTS, THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE ASKING US TO DO AND IF\nTHAT'S THE CASE, I WILL GO. FAMILIES LIKE MINE ARE THE ONES\nTHAT BLEED FIRST. BUT LET'S MAKE SURE THE AMERICAN\nPEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT WE ARE ENGAGING IN AND LET'S HOLD OUR\nALLIES ACCOUNTABLE BECAUSE WE CAN'T DO IT ALL.\n>> SENATOR KIRK, 30 SECONDS TO REBUT?\n>> I HAD FORGOTTEN THAT YOUR PARENTS CAME ALL THE WAY FROM\nTHAILAND TO SERVE GEORGE WASHINGTON.\n>> OKAY. SO LOT OF PEOPLE FOUND THAT KIND\nOF DISTASTEFUL, RIGHT. >> RIGHT.\n>> TAMMY DUCKWORTH DID LOSE BOTH LEGS FIGHTING FOR AMERICA.\n>> RIGHT. RIGHT.\nLOOK, SHE'S RIGHT. IN FACT, LET'S SET UP THIS RACE.\nTHIS IS THE MOST VULNERABLE REPUBLICAN RIGHT NOW IN THE\nUNITED STATES SENATE. I DON'T THINK ANYONE THINKS HE,\nINCLUDING REPUBLICANS, THINKS HE'S GOING TO WIN RE-ELECTION.\nTAMMY DUCKWORTH APPEARS TO BE ON A GLIDE PATH TO WIN.\nLET'S NOT FORGET, ILLINOIS, DEMOCRATIC STATE, ALSO BARACK\nOBAMA'S HOME STATE. PUTTING THAT ASIDE.\nSIGN OF DESPERATION, THOUGH, RIGHT THERE.\nAS YOU SAID, A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE WEIGHED IN INCLUDING\nHILLARY CLINTON. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT SHE\nPUT OUT ON TWITTER THIS MORNING WHERE SHE SAYS THANKFUL FOR\nTAMMY DUCKWORTH AND HER FAMILY'S SERVICE TO THE COUNTRY.\nIT'S REALLY NOT THAT HARD TO GRASP.\nTO TIE THIS ALL TOGETHER, TAMMY DUCKWORTH IS CORRECT.\nHER MOTHER IS FROM THAILAND. HER FATHER WAS BORN IN THE\nUNITED STATES AND HER FATHER'S SIDE OF THE FAMILY GOES ALL THE\nWAY BACK. I THINK MARK KIRK PROBABLY WOKE\nUP THIS MORNING AND SAID WHAT DID I DO TO MYSELF.\n>> MARK PRESTON, MANY THANKS.",

AND THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATE WON'T BE ALONE. AT HIS SIDE FORMER CONGRESSWOMAN\nGABBY GIFRDS AND MARK KELLY AS THEY'LL BE THERE TO PROMOTE GUN\nLEGISLATION. THIS AS THE NRA POURS MILLIONS\nOF DOLLARS INTO ADS AIMED AT KEEPING HILLARY CLINTON OUT OF\nTHE WHITE HOUSE. >> HILLARY SAYS --\n>> AND WHEN IT COMES TO GUNS, WE HAVE JUST TOO MANY GUNS.\n>> THE SUPREME COURT IS WRONG ON THE SECOND AMENDMENT.\n>> HILLARY'S MADE HER CHOICE. NOW, YOU GET TO MAKE YOURS.\nDEFEND FREEDOM. DEFEAT HILLARY.\n>> THE NRA UNDERSCORES JUST HOW IMPORTANT THIS ELECTION IS WHEN\nIT COMES TO GUN RIGHTS SINCE THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL NOMINATE A\nSUPREME COURT JUSTICE TO FILL AN OPEN SPOT.\nLET'S TALK ABOUT THIS AND MORE. I'M JOINED BY RETIRED ASTRONAUT\nMARK KELLY. HE'S THE HUSBAND OF GABBY\nGIFFORDS AND COFOUNDER OF AMERICANS FOR RESPONSIBLE\nSOLUTIONS WHICH SUPPORTS LEGISLATORS WHO TAKE ON GUN\nLOBBYISTS. WELCOME.\n>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME ON. >> THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.\nBY THE WAY WE DID REACH OUT TO THE NRA THIS MORNING TO BE ON\nTHE SHOW, AND WE HAVE NOT HEARD BACK.\nSO FIRST QUESTION TO YOU, MARK. POLITICO SAYS THE NRA HAS POURED\n$26 MILLION INTO ADS TO DEFEAT CLINTON IN KEY SWING STATES YET\nSHE'S RUNNING AHEAD OR WITH MR. TRUMP IN PENNSYLVANIA,\nVIRGINIA, NORTH CAROLINA AND OHIO.\nTHERE WAS A TIME WHEN THE NRA WAS CONSIDERED ALL-POWERFUL IN\nTHOSE LARGELY PRO-GUN STATES. SO WHAT HAPPENED.\n>> WELL, I THINK, YOU KNOW, GABBY AND I AND OUR ORGANIZATION\nGOT INVOLVED, AND THERE ARE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS, AND THE NRA\nAND THE GUN LOBBY IS NO LONGER WORKING IN A VACUUM.\nI MEAN FOR 40 YEARS, THEY OWNED THE POLITICS ON THIS ISSUE.\nAND THEY DON'T OWN IT ANYMORE. WHEN YOU COMMUNICATE WITH THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE, AND YOU DRAW A DISTINCTION BETWEEN WHAT THE GUN\nLOBBY STANDS FOR, AND WHAT RESPONSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO GUN\nVIOLENCE LOOK LIKE, MORE OFTEN THAN NOT UPWARDS OF 90% OF THE\nTIME THEY WANT RESPONSIBLE CHANGE.\n>> SO YOU'RE ON THIS CROSS-COUNTRY TOUR TO PROMOTE\nCOMMONSENSE GUN LAWS AND YOU SAID YOU GET OFF THE BUS, YOU GO\nINTO GUN SHOWS, YOU TRY TO ENGAGE GUN OWNERS, AND TALK WITH\nTHEM. WHAT HAS THE RECEPTION BEEN\nLIKE? >> YOU KNOW, I'M A GUN OWNER\nMYSELF. I OWN SIX GUNS.\nGABBY'S BEEN A GUN OWNER MOST OF HER ADULT LIFE.\nSO I UNDERSTAND THESE -- THESE FOLKS, YOU KNOW, PRETTY WELL.\nAND I'M A STRONG -- I LOOK AT MYSELF AS A STRONG SUPPORTER OF\nTHE SECOND AMENDMENT. AT THE SAME TIME, WE NEED TO DO\nA MUCH BETTER JOB KEEPING GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF FELONS,\nDOMESTIC ABUSERS, THE DANGEROUSLY MENTALLY ILL, AND\nEVEN TERRORISTS. SO WHEN YOU TALK TO THESE PEOPLE\nAND YOU PRESENT THEM WITH DATA AND A LITTLE BIT OF LOGIC, AND\nYOU LISTEN TO THEM, YOU KNOW, OFTEN YOU FIND THERE ARE THINGS\nTHAT YOU COULD AGREE UPON. BUT, YOU KNOW, LIKE WE'VE SEEN\nOVER DECADES OF THIS ISSUE HAS BECOME SO POLITICIZED, AND SO\nHEATED, YOU KNOW, IT'S -- IT'S SOMETIMES -- IT MAKES IT QUITE\nTHE CHALLENGE. BUT WE'RE MAKING A LOT OF GREAT\nPROCESS IN A LOT OF PLACES, ESPECIALLY HERE IN CURRENTLY IN\nTHE STATE OF FLORIDA. >> THERE'S STILL THAT SENTIMENT\nOUT THERE, AND IT'S VERY STRONG THAT HILLARY CLINTON MEANS TO\nTAKE AWAY PEOPLE'S GUNS. YOU KNOW, WE HEAR THAT ALL THE\nTIME. HOW -- HOW DOES SHE CONVINCE\nPEOPLE -- BECAUSE SHE SAYS THAT'S NOT WHAT IT'S ABOUT WITH\nHER. >> YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.\nI MEAN SHE SAYS THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN, THAT SHE'S -- YOU\nKNOW, SHE'S NOT IN FAVOR OF GETTING RID OF THE SECOND\nAMENDMENT. THAT SHE SUPPORTS GUN OWNERSHIP\nOF RESPONSIBLE PEOPLE. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT'S ALL SHE\nCAN DO. ULTIMATELY WE'RE GOING TO SEE\nTHROUGH HER ACTIONS WHEN SHE'S ELECTED PRESIDENT, BUT YOU KNOW,\nI DON'T BELIEVE FOR ONE SECOND THAT SHE, YOU KNOW, HAS ANOTHER\nAGENDA WITH REGARDS TO THE SECOND AMENDMENT.\nSHE TALKS ABOUT KEEPING COMMUNITIES AND FAMILIES SAFE.\nAND IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THERE ARE A FEW THINGS YOU CAN DO TO\nGET SAFER COMMUNITIES. ONE OF THOSE THINGS IS KEEPING\nGUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF PEOPLE THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE THEM, BY\nHAVING MORE UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECK LAWS, BY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE\nLEGISLATION. ONE CLEAR THING THAT WE SHOULD\nDO AS A NATION IS KEEP GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF SUSPECTED\nTERRORISTS. SO THOSE ARE THINGS SHE\nSUPPORTS. HER OPPONENT DOES NOT SUPPORT\nTHOSE CHANGES. YOU KNOW, HE HAS SAID TIME AND\nTIME AGAIN THAT HE IS ENDORSED BY THE NATIONAL RIFLE\nASSOCIATION, AND I IMAGINE YOU COULD EXPECT THAT HE'S GOING TO\nDO WHATEVER THIS VERY POWERFUL CORPORATE LOBBY WANTS HIM TO DO,\nIF HE WAS TO BE ELECTED PRESIDENT.\n>> I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO ASK YOU, EVER SINCE THE DEMOCRATIC\nNATIONAL CONVENTION, WHEN YOUR WIFE WALKED ACROSS THAT STAGE,\nAND GAVE THAT SHORT SPEECH, AND, AND GOT THAT WONDERFUL\nRECEPTION, WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND AS SHE DID THAT?\n>> WELL, I MEAN, I -- YOU KNOW, I THINK ABOUT HOW HARD SHE'S\nWORKED. I MEAN, SHE WAS SHOT AND NEARLY\nASSASSINATED A LITTLE OVER FIVE YEARS AGO.\nAND IT TOOK A LOT OF HARD WORK OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME FOR\nHER TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE SHE COULD WALK ON THE STAGE, AND\nIN FRONT OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ON TELEVISION, GIVE A SPEECH\nWITH NO NOTES. YOU KNOW, MOST OF THE PEOPLE,\nINCLUDING MYSELF, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE THE TELEPROMPTER.\nGABBY DOESN'T USE THE TELEPROMPTER.\nSHE WENT OUT THERE AND JUST DELIVERED THIS FROM HER HEART.\nAND I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD OF HER.\n>> AND JUST A FINAL QUESTION. BECAUSE YOU KNOW I'VE ALWAYS\nWONDERED THIS, TOO, IF ANYONE HAS THE RIGHT TO BE ANGRY ABOUT\nLAX GUN LAWS OR BITTER ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR WIFE, IT'S\nYOU. SO HOW ARE YOU NOT BITTER?\n>> WELL, I THINK I'M NOT BITTER BECAUSE OF GABBY.\nYOU KNOW, SHE IS NOT A BITTER PERSON.\nSHE TALKS ABOUT, YOU KNOW, SHE'S A FIGHTER.\nBUT AT THE SAME TIME SHE JUST WANTS TO MOVE AHEAD AND WORK\nHARD TO MAKE THIS COUNTRY A BETTER PLACE.\nAND YOU KNOW, THE FACT THAT I'VE",

THEY WERE TIED TOGETHER, AND ALL\nELECTROCUTED. THIS HAPPENING AT MOSUL\nUNIVERSITY. THEIR BODIES WERE THEN LEFT OUT\nIN THE OPEN AS A MESSAGE TO THE REST OF THE POPULATION.\nNOW, WE'RE ALSO HEARING WORD THAT TENSE OF THOUSANDS OF\nPEOPLE ARE BEING ROUNDED UP FROM THE VILLAGES NEAR MOSUL.\nJUST ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF MOSUL. AND AS YOU SAID, BEING BROUGHT\nIN TO THE CITY TO JOIN WHAT 1 MILLION, 1.5 MILLION OTHER\nCIVILIANS IN THE CITY, ALL BEING HELD AS HUMAN SHIELDS.\nTHIS OBVIOUSLY IS GOING TO MAKE THE RETAKING OF MOSUL EXTREMELY\nCOMPLICATED FOR IRAQI FORCES",

TRUMP PLEASE STOP TALKING ABOUT A RIGGED ELECTION.\nWE HAVE REACHED OUT TO ELECTIONS OFFICIALS IN OHIO, PENNSYLVANIA\nAND TEXAS. THERE IS ZERO EVIDENCE OF A\nRIGGED ELECTION. HERE'S WHAT TRUMP SUPPORT AND\nOHIO SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN HUSTED TOLD ME.\n>> I'LL SAY A COUPLE THINGS. FIRST OF ALL, I CAN REASSURE\nDONALD TRUMP I AM IN CHARGE OF ELECTIONS IN OHIO AND THEY'RE\nNOT GOING TO BE RIGGED. I'LL MAKE SURE OF THAT.\nOUR INSTITUTIONS LIKE OUR ELECTIONS SYSTEM IS ONE OF THE\nBEDROCKS OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY. WE SHOULD NOT QUESTION IT.\n>> TALK OF A RIGGED ELECTION UNDERMINES AMERICA'S DEMOCRACY,\nAND NO, IT IS NOT PATRIOTIC TO THREATEN THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE\nIF MR. TRUMP DOES NOT CONVINCE ENOUGH AMERICANS TO CAST A\nBALLOT FOR HIM. LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS NOW.\nREBECCA BURGH IS WITH ME A NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER FOR\nREAL CLEAR POLITICS. ERR ROLL LEWIS IS HERE, AND ANN\nSTELTER IS PRESIDENT OF THE POLLING FIRM STELTER AND COMPANY\nA VERY WELL RESPECTED POLLING FIRM I MIGHT ADD.\nANN MY FIRST QUESTION TO YOU. OFFICIALS IN YOUR HOME STATE OF\nIOWA ISSUED A STATEMENT REFUTING TRUMP'S CLAIMS, AND SAYING\nTHERE'S BEEN NO EVIDENCE OF TAMPERING WITH THE PROCESS.\nWHAT ARE YOU HEARING FROM IOWANS?\n>> WELL, I CAN TELL YOU THAT SEVERAL YEARS AGO THE FORMER\nSECRETARY OF STATE LAUNCHED A MASSIVE INVESTIGATION INTO WHAT\nWAS HAPPENING WITH VOTER FILES, DID THEY MATCH UP WITH THE\nPEOPLE WHO WERE ACTUALLY ELIGIBLE TO VOTE.\nKIND OF HOPING TO FIND THAT THERE WERE PROBLEMS WITH THE\nFILE. BUT WE GOT THE GOOD HOUSEKEEPING\nSEAL OF APPROVAL. THAT IS OUR FILES ARE CLEAN.\nAND WE KEEP THEM CLEAN. AND THERE -- SO THERE'S JUST, IN\nTHAT WAY THAT YOU CAN DEFINE RIGGING, NO EVIDENCE THAT THAT'S\nREALLY POSSIBLE IN IOWA. >> SO, ERROL, FORMER GOP\nCONGRESSMAN JOE WALSH OF ILLINOIS, WHO IS KNOWN FORIBLE\nFLAPPER TO LANGUAGE IS RAISING EYEBROWS AFTER TWEETING THIS.\nQUOTE, ON NOVEMBER 8th, I'M VOTING FOR TRUMP.\nON NOVEMBER 9th, IF TRUMP LOSES I'M GRABBING MY MUSKET.\nYOU IN? HE ENDED THE TWEET LIKE THAT.\nWALSH DEFENDS HIS COMMENTSLE IN A CNN INTERVIEW THIS MORNING.\n>> WHEN I SAY GRAB YOUR MUSKET, MAN AND LET'S GO TO WAR, IF\nHILLARY WINS, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S GOING TO BE IN OUR\nSIGHTS. BECAUSE ALL THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE\nPISSED OFF AGAIN AT WHAT WE BELIEVE, CHRIS, IS A CORRUPT\nPOLITICAL SYSTEM, WE'RE AS ANGRY AT REPUBLICANS AS WE ARE AT\nDEMOCRATS. EVEN IF TRUMP LOSES, FAIR AND\nSQUARE, CHRIS, THE ANGER IS NOT GOING TO GO ANYWHERE.\n>> SO, ERROL, WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT HE MEANS BY THAT?\n>> I'LL TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD THAT GRAB YOUR MUSKET MEANS\nATTACKING FELLOW REPUBLICANS AND TRYING TO SORT OF CHANGE THE\nPARTY AROUND BY LEGAL MEANS. IT'S THAT KIND OF ROUGH TALK,\nTHOUGH, IT'S THAT KIND OF SORT OF BORDERLINE VIOLENT TALK WITH\nTHESE SORT OF INTIMATIONS THAT CAN CROSS THE LINE BETWEEN BEING\nPASSIONATE AND COLORFUL AND BEING SORT OF MENACING AND\nTHREATENING. AND I THINK THERE'S BEEN A LOT\nOF DISCUSSION, PEOPLE SEEM TO BE A LITTLE BIT UNEASY ABOUT THE\nPROSPECT OF THAT. I PERSONALLY DON'T FEEL THAT\nWAY. I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR LAW\nENFORCEMENT, FOR THE MILITARY, FOR THE CUSTOMS AND TRADITIONS\nTHAT HOLD THE COUNTRY TOGETHER. IF A FEW PEOPLE WANT TO REALLY\nSERIOUSLY ACT OUT, I THINK IN ALMOST EVERY JURISDICTION IN\nTHIS COUNTRY THERE'S SOMEBODY THERE WHO IS READY TO SORT OF\nGET THEM BACK WITHIN THE LINES IF THEY REALLY WANT TO SORT OF\nACT CRAZY. YOU KNOW, THE REALITY IS ONE OF\nTHE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS OF DEMOCRACY IS THAT SOMETIMES YOU\nLOSE. SOMETIMES YOUR CANDIDATE LOSES.\nNOT THAT YOU DID ANYTHING WRONG. NOT BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE\nBEST IDEAS BUT BECAUSE WE DO OPERATE ON A SYSTEM THAT\nINVOLVES THE MAJORITY SORT OF MAKING A DETERMINATION AND\nTHAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE HAPPEN ON NOVEMBER 8th.\n>> REBECCA, THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THE ANGER WILL REMAIN, YOU\nKNOW, IF DONALD TRUMP LOSES. RIGHT?\nIF HILLARY CLINTON BECOMES PRESIDENT.\nTHERE WILL BE ANGER THERE. AND THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH\nACTS OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT, THAT\nHAPPENS ALL THE TIME IN OUR COUNTRY.\nBUT THE WAY IT'S BEING DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW IS DISTURBING.\n>> ABSOLUTELY. AND IT MATTERS.\nTHESE WORDS MATTER ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE COMING FROM PUBLIC\nOFFICIALS OR FORMER PUBLIC OFFICIALS WHO HAVE A MEG APHONE\nWHO HAVE A LARGER PLATFORM THAN SOMM SOMEONE ON FACEBOOK OR\nTWITTER WOULD HAVE AS EVIDENCED BY THE FACT WE'RE INTERVIEWING\nJOE WALSH, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS.\nIT MATTERS THAT THEY USE THESE WORDS.\nAND SO THERE IS THE RISK OF, YOU KNOW, HOW ARE PEOPLE GOING TO\nACT OUT ON THEIR ANGER AFTER THIS ELECTION?\nWHO ARE THEY GOING TO DIRECT THEIR ANGER AT?\nDONALD TRUMP IS ALREADY OUT THERE TALKING AS WE KNOW ABOUT\nTHIS RIGGED ELECTION. ARE THEY GOING TO DIRECT THEIR\nANGER AT ELECTION OFFICIALS IN THE STATES?\nARE THEY GOING TO DOUBT THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION?\nTHESE ARE ALL REALLY RELEVANT QUESTIONS AT THIS POINT AND THIS\nISN'T REALLY A SCENARIO WE HAVE FACED TO THIS EXTENT IN RECENT\nELECTIONS. >> BUT I JUST WANT TO GO BACK TO\nTHIS NOTION OF A RIGGED ELECTION, THAT THERE'S MASSIVE\nVOTER FRAUD ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY.\nBECAUSE -- AND I JUST WANT TO LOOK AT THIS LOGICALLY RIGHT\nNOW. SO LET'S LOOK AT THE STATE OF\nTEXAS, WHERE MR. TRUMP IS SAYING THAT THERE ARE INSTANCES OF\nVOTER FRAUD AND HE'S AFRAID THAT HE'S GOING TO LOSE THE ELECTION\nTHERE. YES, THERE WERE A HANDFUL OF\nSUSPECT BALLOTS IN TEXAS. IT HAPPENS.\nNO SYSTEM IS PERFECT. BUT LET'S ASSUME THE PROBLEM IS\nRAMPANT. TEXAS HAS A REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR,\nA REPUBLICAN SECRETARY OF STATE, BOTH U.S. SENATORS ARE\nREPUBLICANS, 25 TEXAS REPUBLICANS WERE ELECTED TO THE\nHOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, INCLUDING MANY TRUMP SUPPORTERS,\nYES MR. TRUMP DID NOT WIN TEXAS DURING THE PRIMARY BUT ANOTHER\nREPUBLICAN NATIVE SON DID AND THAT WOULD BE TED CRUZ.\nSO, IF INDEED THERE IS WIDESPREAD VOTER FRAUD IN TEXAS,\nWHY ARE THERE SO MANY REPUBLICANS IN OFFICE?\n>> YOU'RE COMING TO ME FOR THAT? >> YES.\n>> I THINK THE ANSWER IS THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF\nMONITORING OF BOTH PARTIES, IN THE ACTUAL PROCESS.\nAND I THINK IN 2, ONE OF THE REASONS THAT IT IS SO REPUBLICAN\nDOMINATED HAS TO DO WITH THE WAY THE CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS ARE\nDRAWN. AND WHEN YOU HAVE CONTROL OF ONE\nPARTY WHO THEN CONTROLS THAT PROCESS, YOU END UP WITH A LOT\nOF PEOPLE FROM THAT PARTY ELECTED TO OFFICE.\nI THINK, YOU KNOW, THE QUESTION REALLY WHEN YOU HEAR THE WORD\nRIGGED, PEOPLE IMMEDIATELY THINK THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE SHOWING UP\nIN PERSON TO VOTE WHO ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO VOTE.\nAND I DON'T THINK ANYWHERE WE HAVE FOUND THAT -- THAT THERE'S\nEVIDENCE OF THAT. BUT THERE ARE MANY OTHER PARTS\nOF THE SNAKE THAT IS THE PROCESS OF VOTING AND COUNTING THOSE\nVOTES. AND SO I THINK, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE\nWORRIED ABOUT WHETHER IT'S -- YOU CAN HACK INTO THAT SYSTEM.\nWHETHER PUBLIC OFFICIALS COULD CHANGE NUMBERS IN THE TALLIES.\nAGAIN, THERE ARE OBSERVERS FOR ALL OF THESE PROCESSES IF IT'S\nMORE SUN LIGHT THAN ANYTHING ELSE, SO, IT WILL BE INTERESTING\nTO SEE IF THERE END UP BEING CREDIBLE CHALLENGES TO RIGGING.\nIT SEEMS LIKE THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED AGAINST RIGGING.\n>> OH, I LIKE THAT. VERY FUN.\nERROL LEWIS, REBECCABERG, ANY SELTZER, THANKS SO MUCH FOR\nJOINING ME THIS MORNING. NOW TO MIKE PENCE'S HARROWING\nLANDING. CNN'S DEBORAH FEYERICK IS LIVE\nAT LaGUARDIA TO TELL US MORE ABOUT THAT.\nHI, DEBORAH. >> HEY THERE, CAROL.\nWELL IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME A PLANE HAS ACTUALLY SKIDDED OFF\nTHE RUNWAY HERE AT LaGUARDIA AIRPORT.\nWHAT MAKES IT UNIQUE IS THE FACT THAT THIS WAS A PLANE BELONGING\nTO THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE.\nNOW OFFICIALS SAY THAT IT OVERSHOT THE RUNWAY AND LANDED\nWAY TOO QUICKLY. PEEL ON BOARD THE PLANE SAY IT\nHAPPENED SO FAST, THAT THEY DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE THE PLANE\nWAS ON THE GRASS UNTIL AFTER THEY GOT OFF THAT PLANE.\n>> WE HAVE A EMERGENCY IN THE AIRPORT.\n>> A FRIGHTENING EXPERIENCE FOR DONALD TRUMP'S RUNNING MATE MIKE\nPENCE. >> WHEN WE LANDED IT WAS OBVIOUS\nTHAT THE PILOTS WERE BREAKING VERY AGGRESSIVELY ON THE RUNWAY.\nWE COULD FEEL THAT. AND THEN, WE BEGAN TO FEEL THE\nPLANE FISHTAIL A LITTLE BIT. >> FLYING IN FROM FORT DODGE,\nIOWA, THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN'S CHARTER PLANE CARRYING THE\nINDIANA GOVERNOR SKIDDING OFF THE RUNWAY UPON LANDING AT NEW\nYORK'S LaGUARDIA AIRPORT. >> WE WERE MOVING DOWN THE\nRUNWAY MUCH MORE QUICKLY THAN A PLANE SHOULD BE GOING IF IT'S\nLANDING. >> Reporter: INVESTIGATORS WILL\nBE LOOKING AT A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING WEATHER.\nONE LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCE TELLING CNN IT APPEARS PENCE'S\nPLANE CAME IN TOO FAST AND LANDED TOO LATE ON A RAIN-SOAKED\nRUNWAY. THE PLANE WAS SLOWED THANKS TO\nCEMENT BLOCKS INSTALLED AT THE END OF THE RUNWAY, PREVENTING\nTHE PLANE FROM CAREENING ONTO A MAJOR HIGHWAY.\n>> THE PLANE ENDED UP IN THE ARRESTER BED AT THE END OF THE\nRUNWAY, DESTROYED ABOUT 80 ARRESTER BED BLOCKS.\n>> Reporter: THE PLANE, COMING TO A STOP DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO\nTRAFFIC. A SAFETY LAYER ON THE RUNWAY\nTORN UP, AVOIDING A CATASTROPHE. >> EASTERN STOP, STOP.\nGO AROUND. GO AROUND JET BLUE 1640.\n>> AUDIO FROM THE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL TOWER CAPTURING THE\nTENSE MOMENTS WITH CREWS ARRIVING ON SCENE WITHIN ONE\nMINUTE. >> WE'RE GETTING HELP FOR YOU.\n>> Reporter: OFFICIALS SAY PENCE WAS REASSURED BY FLASHING LIGHTS\nUPON EXITING THE PLANE. LATER TWEETING SO THANKFUL\nEVERYONE ON OUR PLANE IS SAFE. TRUMP REACTING TO THE SCARE AT A\nRALLY. >> I JUST SPOKE TO MIKE PENCE,\nAND HE'S FINE. >> AND YOU HEARD MIKE PENCE\nDISCUSS THE LIGHTS THAT HE SAW BY THE PLANE.\nEMERGENCY VEHICLES NEXT TO THAT PLANE WITHIN MOMENTS OF THIS ALL\nHAPPENING. THEY ACTUALLY PRACTICED FOR\nTHOSE KINDS OF ACCIDENTS OR INCIDENTS I SHOULD SAY TO\nHAPPEN. THE NTSB IS COMING IN FROM\nWASHINGTON TO INVESTIGATE WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE AND WHY\nTHIS OCCURRED. IN THE MEANTIME, A NEW PLANE\nCHARTERED BOEING 737 IS BEING FLOWN UP IN THE SAME COMPANY AND\nMIKE PENCE WILL BE ON THAT PLANE TO CAMPAIGN.\nHE WILL BE LEAVING THIS TIME OUT OF NEWARK.\nCAROL? >> ALL RIGHT, DEBORAH FEYERICK\nREPORTING LIVE FOR US. THANKS SO MUCH.\nSTILL TO COME IN THE \"NEWSROOM,\" THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE FOR VOTERS\nIS THE ECONOMY, STUPID. AND IS IT FINALLY ABOUT TO BE\nFRONT AND CENTER ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL?

      "text": ">>> CRUCIAL NEWS ON THE ECONOMIC\nFRONT. JUST 11 DAYS BEFORE ELECTION\nDAY, JUST MINUTES AGO WE LEARNED THE U.S. ECONOMY GREW AT 2.9% IN\nTHE THIRD QUARTER. THAT IS THE FASTEST RATE IN TWO\nYEARS. CNN MONEY CHIEF BUSINESS\nCORRESPONDENT CHRISTINE ROMANS IS HERE WITH ME NOW TO TELL US\nEXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANS. >> WELL THE ECONOMY IS DOING\nBETTER THAN WE THOUGHT IT WAS IN THE BEGINNING PART OF THE YEAR,\nCERTAINLY TWICE THE ECONOMIC GROWTH WE SAW IN THE FIRST PART\nOF THE YEAR. LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT IT LOOKS\nLIKE ON A CHART HERE 2.9% ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE THIRD\nQUARTER. YOU COULD SEE THE FIRST QUARTER\nWAS A SLUGGISH 1.4%. AND THERE WERE CONCERNS IN -- IN\nTHE SECOND QUARTER THE FIRST QUARTER LATE LAST NIGHT, NOW\nTHIS 2.9% IS THE BEST WE'VE SEEN IN A COUPLE OF YEARS, CAROL.\nLET ME PUT IT IN BROADER PERSPECTIVE.\nIT SHOWS AN AMERICAN ECONOMY CONTINUING TO CLIMB OUT OF THE\nDEEP, DARK DAYS OF 2009. NOW YOU'VE HEARD ON THE CAMPAIGN\nTRAIL DONALD TRUMP SAYS THIS IS A RESULT OF BAD DEMOCRATIC\nPOLICIES AND THAT HIS POLICIES IMMEDIATELY WOULD PROPEL THE\nUNITED STATES ECONOMY TO 4% GROWTH.\n4% GROWTH YOU CAN SEE IS SOMETHING WE LAST SAW BACK IN\nTHE 1990s. THE LATE 1990s.\nTHIS NUMBER SHOWS THAT THE AMERICAN CONSUMER APPEARS\nCONFIDENT. WE SAW THAT IN THE CONSUMER\nCONFIDENCE NUMBER JUST LAST MONTH.\nTHE AMERICAN CONSUMER IS SPENDING BUSINESS SPENDING IS\nLESS DRAG ON THE ECONOMY. WHAT IS THIS NUMBER, CAROL?\nYOU KNOW THIS IS A NUMBER THAT MEASURES JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING.\nWHAT WE IMPORT. WHAT WE EXPORT.\nHOW MUCH MONEY WORKERS ARE MAKING.\nWHAT THEY'RE SPENDING. HOW MUCH BUSINESSES ARE SPENDING\nON FACTORIES AND RETOOLING. SO THIS IS THE BIGGEST MOST\nCOMPREHENSIVE PIECE OF ECONOMIC DATA BEFORE THE ELECTION CAROL.\n>> ALL RIGHT, CHRISTINE ROMANS STAY RIGHT THERE.\nBECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS NEW.\nI WANT TO BRING IN KATRINA PEARSON THE NATIONAL SPOKESWOMAN\nFOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND ANGELA RYE IS A CNN POLITICAL\nCOMMENTATOR AND FORMER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CONGRESSIONAL\nBLACK CAUCUS. WELCOME TO YOU BOTH.\nKATRINA THE ECONOMIC NUMBERS APPEAR HEALTHY.\nWHY DO SO MANY TRUMP SUPPORTERS FEEL WE'RE ON THE VERGE OF\nECONOMIC DISASTER. >> WELL, I THINK YOU'VE\nMENTIONED THE OPERATIVE WORD, WHICH IS APPEAR.\nVERY EASILY ELEVEN DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION.\nBUT I DON'T THINK ANY WORKING CLASS AMERICAN IS GETTING UP AND\nCHEERING ON A 2.9 PERCENT ECONOMIC GROWTH BECAUSE THE FACT\nREMAINS, THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS STILL PUMPING MONEY INTO THE\nECONOMY, FREE MONEY, WHICH LEADS TO A FALSE ECONOMY AND NOW THAT\nWE HAVE GLOBALLY INTEREST RATES STILL VERY, VERY LOW AND\nSOMETIMES NEGATIVE IN CASES IT MEANS IT'S AN ARTIFICIAL STOCK\nMARKET. WORKING PEOPLE NEED JOBS, AND\nTHEY NEED INCREASED WAGES. AND BECAUSE OF WAGES AND JOBS WE\nDON'T HAVE THE MIDDLE CLASS THAT ARE ABLE TO EITHER BORROW MONEY,\nOR HAVE THE INCOME TO SUSTAIN CONSUMPTION AT THIS POINT.\nSO I THINK THE REAL TEST IS GOING TO BE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN\nINTEREST RATES GO UP. >> OKAY, SO I WANT TO BEFORE I\nGET TO YOU ANGELA I WANT TO GO BACK TO CHRISTINE BECAUSE\nKATRINA SAID A NUMBER OF THINGS. >> YEAH, WELL, INTEREST RATES --\nWELL THIS KIND OF REPORT SHOWS THE ECONOMY IS HEALTHY ENOUGH TO\nWITHSTAND HIGHER INTEREST RATES. A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THE FED\nWILL RAISE INTEREST RATES AND START TO UNDO ALL OF THAT LOOSE\nECONOMIC POLICY BY THE END OF THE YEAR.\nWHEN YOU TAKE THIS NUMBER WITH JOBS GROWTH IT IS STILL LOOKING\nSTRONG FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE A JOB BY THE WAY, WE DO RECOGNIZE\nTHERE ARE A HOST OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT OF THE LABOR\nMARKET. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE JOB\nMARKET NUMBERS, CONSUMER CONFIDENCE NUMBERS, JUST\nYESTERDAY THERE WAS A CNN/ORC POLL THAT SAY 54% OF PEOPLE SAY\nAMERICA IS ON THE RIGHT TRACK. YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A BETTER\nFEELING ABOUT THE ECONOMY OVERALL.\n>> I WILL SAY AND I'LL POST THIS TO ANGELA WHEN I WENT TO OHIO\nLAST WEEK AND TALKED TO VOTERS WHO LIVE IN TRUMP COUNTRY SO TO\nSPEAK, THOSE VOTERS IN FAVOR OF DONALD TRUMP THEY SAID THAT\nTHEIR BIGGEST FEAR IS ECONOMIC COLLAPSE AND WHILE THEY MAY BE\nDOING WELL NOW, THEY JUST HAVE A REAL FEAR OF THE FUTURE.\nSO IN ORDER FOR THEM TO EVEN CONSIDER HILLARY CLINTON SHE'S\nGOING TO HAVE TO MAKE THEM FEEL BETTER ABOUT THE FUTURE.\nWHY CAN'T SHE DO THAT? >> WELL, AND I DON'T KNOW THAT\nSHE CAN'T DO IT, CAROL. I THINK THE REALITY OF IT IS\n2007 AND THE MORTGAGE BUBBLE BURSTING AND THAT CRISIS IS NOT\nTHAT FAR FROM HERE. RIGHT THAT'S A VERY RECENT\nTRAUMA THAT MANY PEOPLE IN ALL OVER THE COUNTRY HAVE FACED.\nPARTICULARLY IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR.\nI WOULD LIKE TO GO BACK TO SOMETHING KATRINA MENTIONED,\nWHICH WAS THE MIDDLE CLASS IS HURTING.\nWELL I WOULD GO TO WHAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM THE CENSUS BUREAU\nLAST YEAR WHICH IS THE MIDDLE CLASS, AND POOR PEOPLE, HAD THE\nBEST YEAR THEY'VE HAD EVER SINCE -- IN 2015.\nIN QUITE SOME TIME RATHER. I WON'T SAY EVER.\nIT SAYS THAT REAL MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME WAS $56,500 IN\n2015. THAT IS AN INCREASE FROM $53,700\nTHE YEAR PRIOR. I WOULD ALSO POINT TO YOU THE\nFACT THAT THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS MUCH LOWER THAN WHEN\nPRESIDENT OBAMA STARTED. BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT IS STILL\nDOUBLE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE, AND THAT HAS BEEN THE TRUTH FOR 40\nYEARS. THAT IS NOT PRESIDENT OBAMA'S\nFAULT. I THINK THE REALITY OF IT IS IF\nWE PEDDLE THIS NARRATIVE, THIS CONSPIRACY THEORY THAT THE\nECONOMY IS HORRIBLE, THEN WE'LL CREATE THAT UNREALISTIC AND\nUNFORTUNATE FEAR IN THE LIVES OF PEOPLE.\nTHAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEIR ECONOMIC CONDITION ISN'T REAL --\n>> I JUST WANT TO INTERJECT HERE.\nBECAUSE MR. TRUMP, MR. TRUMP SAID SOMETHING ON THE CAMPAIGN\nTRAIL BECAUSE HE DOES PAINT ESPECIALLY IN THE BLACK\nCOMMUNITY A VERY, VERY BLEAK ECONOMY.\nIN FACT, THIS IS WHAT HE SAID IN TOLEDO, OHIO, JUST YESTERDAY.\nLET'S LISTEN. >> WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON OUR --\nTHE GHETTOS, YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON WHERE YOU HAVE\nPOCKETS OF -- OF AREAS OF LAND, WHERE YOU HAVE THE INNER CITIES,\nYOU HAVE SO MANY THINGS, SO MANY PROBLEMS.\nSO MANY HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE PROBLEMS.\n>> SO KATRINA YOU HEARD MR. TRUMP THERE SAY GHETTOS, AND\nBLACK COMMUNITIES, AND I THINK THAT MANY BLACK AMERICANS WOULD\nSAY YOU'RE NOT REALLY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE WHOLE OF THE\nBLACK POPULATION. >> WELL, I THINK THERE'S ALSO A\nSEGMENT OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY WHO HAVE BEEN CONSULTING\nMR. TRUMP ON THIS ISSUE WHO WOULD DISAGREE WITH YOU BECAUSE\nTHERE ARE SEVERELY DEPRESSED AND SUPPRESSED COMMUNITIES OUT\nTHERE. BUT WE'RE NOT ADDRESSING STILL\nIS THE FEDERAL RESERVE'S IMPACT INTO THIS ECONOMY, AND IF WE'RE\nTALKING ABOUT A $3,000 TO $4,000 WAGE INCREASE AMONG THE WORKING\nCLASS WHICH HAS COMPLETELY BEEN WIPED OUT BY OBAMACARE PREMIUMS,\nNOT TO MENTION HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO RAISE TAXES.\nTHIS DOES NOT LOOK GOOD FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS.\n>> CAN I JUST RESPOND TO THIS REALLY QUICKLY, CAROL?\n>> SURE. >> I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT\nTHAT WHEN WE HAVE CONVERSATIONS LIKE THIS THEY'RE ROOTED IN\nFACT. >> ABSOLUTELY.\n>> SO LET'S TALK ABOUT -- LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT DONALD TRUMP\nCOULD ACTUALLY BE SAYING TO BLACK PEOPLE THAT WOULD RESONATE\nAND BE BASED IN TRUTH. SO THERE'S AN ACCESS TO CAPITAL\nISSUES. PEOPLE LIKE DONALD TRUMP TAKE\nADVANTAGE OF THE FACT -- >> WHICH IS WHAT I SAID.\n>> NO THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU SAID AT ALL.\nBUT PEOPLE -- >> PEOPLE --\n>> CAPITAL ISSUE. >> I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR\nTHIS BECAUSE THE TRUTH BURNS, BUT PEOPLE LIKE DONALD TRUMP\nACTUALLY TAKE FOR GRANTED THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE READILY\nAVAILABLE ACCESS TO CAPITAL. PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY OFTEN\nTIMES DON'T. BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT THE GHETTO.\nBECAUSE DONALD TRUMP AS WE KNOW IS A REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER THAT\nHAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THINGS LIKE GENTRIFICATION AND THAT'S\nHOW HE ENDED UP KEEPING PEOPLE OUT OF NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THEY\nCOULD EARN MORE INCOME. >> HE ACTUALLY HAS ADDRESSED\nTHAT, ANGELA. >> NO HE HASN'T.\n>> AND BECAUSE FACTS DO MATTER MR. TRUMP HAS ALSO TALKED ABOUT\nTHE FACT -- >> LET KATRINA RESPOND.\n>> -- IF YOU'VE LISTENED TO ANYTHING HE HAS SAID ABOUT THE\nBLACK COMMUNITY OR HIS URBAN DEVELOPMENT HE'S TALKED ABOUT\nTHE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE WITH BLACK AMERICANS BEING ABLE TO\nACCESS CAPITAL AND YOU CAN GO BACK TO WHEN HE TESTIFIED BEFORE\nCONGRESS ON HOW TO FIX THE ECONOMY, HE TALKED ABOUT HAVING\nMORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR MINORITY COMMUNITIES AND HE'S\nWORKED WITH JESSE JACKSON AND THE RAINBOW COALITION TO HELP\nBLACK ENTREPRENEURSHIP. THOSE ARE THE FACTS YOU NEVER\nSEE ON CNN, ANGELA, BECAUSE -- >> ANGELA HAS A FORMER -- YOU\nKNOW, SHE WAS WITH THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS SO IS\nTHAT TRUE ANGELA. >> AND RAN IT INTO THE GROUND.\n>> I'M SORRY. >> AND RAN IT INTO THE GROUND.\n>> I RAN THE CBC INTO THE GROUND?\n>> ABSOLUTELY. >> HA, HA, HA.\nTHAT IS LAUGHABLE. >> -- YOU'RE NOT AWARE OF\nMR. TRUMP'S -- >> NO.\nKATRINA. >> -- POSITIONS.\n>> NO, BECAUSE -- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.\n>> LET ME -- LET ME. >> STOP STOP!\nKATRINA WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?\n>> IT'S RIDICULOUS. >> WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT\nTHAT ANGELA RAN THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS INTO\nTHE GROUND. >> WHAT DID I DO?\n>> THE RECORD IS OUT THERE. LOOK AT WHERE THE FINANCES WERE.\nSO I THINK IT'S INTERESTING -- >> OH, I'M SORRY, HONEY,\nKATRINA, KATRINA -- >> -- DISCUSS BUT WE DON'T WANT\nTO TALK ABOUT THE ACTUAL FACTS OF MR. TRUMP'S POLICIES WHEN IT\nCOMES TO URBAN COMMUNITIES. >> CAROL, CAN I PLEASE RESPOND\nTO THE PERSONAL ATTACK AT THIS POINT?\nLET ME JUST -- LET ME JUST -- >> OKAY, STOP, STOP.\nANGELA HAS TO RESPOND TO THESE CHARGES THAT SHE RAN --\n>> IF SHE'S GOING TO CALL ME A LIAR THEN OF COURSE LET'S HAVE A\nPERSONAL DISCUSSION BECAUSE I AM TIRED OF COMING ON CNN AND\nCOMPLETELY HAVING MR. TRUMP'S POLICIES LIED ABOUT\nCONSISTENTLY, BECAUSE HE HAS ADDRESSED EVERY LAST ONE OF\nTHESE ISSUES WHICH IS WHY HIS SUPPORT IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY\nIS ON THE RISE. >> OKAY.\nGOOD LUCK WITH THAT LIE, AS WELL.\nNOW, LET ME RESPOND TO WHAT YOUR DIRECT --\n>> SEE. >> YOU'RE RIGHT BECAUSE YOU'RE\nLIKE. THE CRITICISM ABOUT THE\nCONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS, HE ACTUALLY HAD A SUCCESSFUL RUN.\nPERHAPS YOU HEARD OF THE JOBS INITIATIVE WHERE WE WENT INTO\nCOMMUNITIES OF COLOR TO ENSURE AT THAT POINT WHEN THE BLACK\nUNEMPLOYMENT RATE WAS DOUBLE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE AND HIGHER THAN\nIT HAS BEEN IN YEARS WE WORKED ON THAT.\nWE WENT TO FIVE CITIES IN URBAN AREAS TO ADDRESS UNEMPLOYMENT\nSPECIFICALLY. AFTER THAT JOBS INITIATIVE WE\nPROVIDED NINE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION THAT\nTHEN MANIFESTED THEMSELVES IN THE AMERICAN JOBS ACT.\nYOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH BLACK\nUNEMPLOYMENT? YOUR REPUBLICAN CONGRESS CHOSE\nNOT TO ADDRESS JOBS. CHOSE NOT TO CONSIDER THAT JOBS\nRECOMMENDATIONS -- THOSE JOBS RECOMMENDATIONS THAT AMERICAN\nJOBS BILL THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED THERE.\nNOW IN TERMS OF FINANCES RUNNING FINANCES INTO THE GROUND, YOU\nWANT TO TALK ABOUT CONGRESSIONAL MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS BUDGETS?\nI GIVE YOU NEWT GINGRICH. ONE OF YOUR OTHER SURROGATES\nLONG BEFORE I WAS EVEN IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, DEAR, NEWT\nGINGRICH SNATCHED CONGRESSIONAL MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS BUDGETS.\nTHE CBC NEVER HAD A BUDGET SO I DON'T KNOW WHICH ORGANIZATION\nYOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. PERHAPS YOU SHOULD GET YOUR\nFACTS TOGETHER BECAUSE WE HAD A BUDGET THAT WAS RUN BY MEMBER\nREPRESENTATIONAL ALLOWANCES. THERE WAS NO MONEY MANAGEMENT\nTHERE. NOW GOING BACK TO THE ECONOMY --\n>> NOW WE -- WE -- WE -- I'M GOING TO STOP THIS NOW.\nTHIS HAS VEERED IN A DIRECTION I NEVER EXPECTED.\n>> IT IS CRAZY LIKE WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT.\nTHAT'S SLANDER. I COULD SUE YOU KATRINA.\n>> OH, MY GOD. OKAY.\nSO -- >> I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ONE\nFINAL POINT. >> BRING US BACK TO WHERE WE\nBEGAN, CAROL. EVERYONE YOU'RE WELCOME.\nTHE, THE, THE, THE POINT I WOULD MAKE IS WE'VE BEEN IN SEVEN\nYEARS OF ECONOMIC EXPANSION AND IT HASN'T FELT LIKE IT BECAUSE\nWE WERE SO AFRAID ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO US IN 2008-2009\nRIGHT. WE REALLY COULDN'T BELIEVE THE\nECONOMY WAS MOVING FORWARD. BUT IT WA",

HER POLICIES ARE SO BAD.\n>> IT'S ALL PART OF HIS OVERALL CASE THAT THE ELECTION IS\nRIGGED. ESPECIALLY IF HE LOSES.\nHE SAID THAT'S THE CASE. THERE ARE SOME REVELATIONS\nTHOUGH FROM WIKILEAKS THAT ARE ALSO STIRRING THE POT HERE.\nVOTERS MAY BE STARTING TO TAKE TRUMP'S CLAIMS SERIOUSLY.\nJOINING US NOW IS DEMOCRATIC SENATOR CLAIRE McCASKILL FROM\nMISSOURI. SHE'S A CLINTON SUPPORTER, MAKE\nTHE CASE THAT DONALD TRUMP IS TRYING TO RIG/SUPPRESS YOUR VOTE\nFOR CLINTON. HOW?\n>> WELL, AS USUAL, DONALD TRUMP IS FACT FREE.\nTHE NOTION THAT THE MOST RESILIENT AND ADMIRED DEMOCRACY\nIN THE WORLD IS NOW SUBJECT TO ELECTION RIGGING IS\nPREPOSTEROUS. PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT\nOUR ELECTION PROCESS IS DECENTRALIZED.\nIT'S CONTROLLED BY LOCAL REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC\nELECTED OFFICIALS ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY.\nINDIVIDUALLY IN COUNTIES AND STATES.\nFRANKLY, IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO RIG AN ELECTION IN THE UNITED\nSTATES OF AMERICA. SO DONALD TRUMP IS DOING WHAT HE\nDOES BEST. HE IS WHINING, HE IS MAKING\nEXCUSES, HE IS FRANKLY RUNNING DOWN THE UNITED STATES OF\nAMERICA IN A WAY THAT HURTS OUR DEMOCRACY AND IS VERY\nUNPATRIOTIC. >> BUT HE IS GIVING VOICE TO\nSOMETHING THAT, ONE, A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE,\nWHETHER OR NOT IT'S TRUE. AND, TWO, PLAYS TO YOUR\nCANDIDATE'S DISADVANTAGE. AND THAT IS, THE SYSTEM.\nIT'S ALL INTERCONNECTED AND INTERTWINED WHETHER IT'S WHAT'S\nGOING ON WITH WASHINGTON INSIDERS, LIKE YOU McCASKILL, OR\nTHE MEDIA, LIKE ALISYN CAMEROTA, OR OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE\nCONSPIRING TO TAKE AWAY THEIR POWER.\nPEOPLE BELIEVE IT, DONALD TRUMP GIVES VOICE TO IT.\nAND HILLARY CLINTON IS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT SYSTEM AND THE\nSTATUS QUO. EFFECTIVE POLITICS MAKES IT\nOKAY? NO I DON'T THINK SO.\nI GET IT THAT PEOPLE WANT CHANGE.\nBUT LET'S BE REALISTIC ABOUT WHAT CHANGE CAN HAPPEN WITH A\nGUY LIKE DONALD TRUMP. I MEAN THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO\nDOESN'T TALK TO ANYBODY BUT HIMSELF.\nHE DOESN'T LISTEN TO OTHERS. HE'S NOT THOUGHTFUL.\nHE'S NOT EVEN INTERESTED IN UNDERSTANDING THE COMPLEX PUBLIC\nPOLICY AND THE PROBLEMS THAT CONFRONT OUR COUNTRY.\nON THE OTHER HAND, HILLARY CLINTON HAS A RECORD OF WORKING\nACROSS THE AISLE. .\nOF ACTUALLY GETTING THINGS DONE. OF NOT GETTING UP.\nOF CONTINUING TO FIGHT FOR THE THINGS THAT AMERICANS REALLY\nCARE ABOUT. SO I, I, I REALLY THINK THAT\nDONALD TRUMP IS SO DISAPPOINTING BECAUSE WE'VE NEVER HAD A\nCANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT IN MY LIFETIME THAT HAS FAILED TO\nINSPIRE, AND THAT HAS INSTEAD SPENT MOST OF HIS CAMPAIGN\nMAKING THINGS UP, NOT TELLING THE TRUTH, AND FRANKLY RUNNING\nOUR COUNTRY DOWN AND OUR MILITARY DOWN.\n>> BUT YOU HAVE TWO CANDIDATES IN THIS RACE WHO ARE WILDLY\nUNPOPULAR, ESPECIALLY WHERE INTEGRITY IS INVOLVED.\nHOW DO YOU MAKE THE CASE TO PEOPLE WHO COME UP TO YOU AND\nSAY, LOOK, I DON'T LIKE WHAT TRUMP SAYS BUT I DON'T LIKE WHAT\nCLINTON DOES. LOOK AT THESE WIKILEAKS, WHETHER\nIT'S THE E-MAIL SERVERS, OR THESE MEMOS THAT SHOW THAT WHEN\nIT COMES TO THE FOUNDATION, THE GOVERNMENT ROLE, AND THEIR\nPOCKET, THERE'S TOO MUCH THREADING ACROSS ALL OF THESE\nTHAT THERE'S STINK THERE. WHAT DO YOU SAY?\n>> WELL, I -- I GET PERCEPTION. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO\nSTAY FOCUSED ON REALITY. THE REALITY IS THAT THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION HAS DONE INCREDIBLE WORK AROUND THE GLOBE AND GETS\nVERY HIGH SCORES FROM INDEPENDENT WATCHDOGS ON\nCHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE TRUMP\nFOUNDATION HAS PAID OFF HIS LEGAL BILLS, HAS ENGAGED IN\nILLEGAL PAYMENTS TO CANDIDATES, AND FRANKLY, ALL YOU NEED TO\nKNOW IS THEY BOUGHT A SIX FOOT PORTRAIT OF DONALD TRUMP.\nI THINK THOSE TWO COMPARISONS TURN OUT PRETTY WELL FOR THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION, AND ON TOP OF THAT, CHRIS, THE STATE\nDEPARTMENT HAS SAID OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT HILLARY CLINTON\nNEVER TOOK INTO ACCOUNT ANY ACTIVITIES OF THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION WHEN SHE WAS ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED\nSTATES -- >> IT LOOKS BAD.\nSHE RECOGNIZED THAT DURING THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS FORSTATE.\nSHE SAID THAT SHE WOULD DO SOMETHING TO MAKE SURE THAT\nTHERE WAS NOT A SEMBLANCE OF IMPROPRIETY.\nDIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE WORKED. WHY DON'T THEY JUST GET OUT OF\nTHAT FOUNDATION BUSINESS, LEAVE IT TO THE RED CROSS AND CATHOLIC\nCHARITIES AND EVERYBODY ELSE WHO DOES THAT WORK AND KEEP THIS\nIDEA OF CONFLICT CLEAN, ESPECIALLY IF SHE IS TO WIN THIS\nELECTION AND BECOME PRESIDENT? >> WELL, CERTAINLY THE\nTRANSPARENCY IS THERE. THEY LIST ALL THEIR DONORS,\nUNLIKE MANY OTHER FOUNDATIONS. OBVIOUSLY THEIR FINANCES HAVE\nBEEN AN OPEN BOOK FOR DECADES. BOTH WITH THEIR PERSONAL\nFINANCIAL DISCLOSURES AND THEIR TAX RETURNS.\nAND ALSO THEY'RE TAKING ADDITIONAL STEPS.\nBUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, THEY'RE DOING INCREDIBLE WORK.\nTHEY'RE HELPING PEOPLE, COUNTRIES CURE MALARIA.\nTHEY'RE HELPING WOMEN ACROSS THE WORLD IN TERMS OF STARTING\nBUSINESSES. THEY ARE DOING GREAT WORK AND I\nTHINK IT'S HARD FOR THEM TO GIVE UP THE CHARITABLE WORK THAT IS\nWHAT THE FOUNDATION IS REALLY ALL ABOUT.\n>> SENATOR CLAIRE McCASKILL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR MAKING\nTHE CASE FOR CLINTON HERE ON \"NEW DAY.\"\nHAVE A GOOD WEEKEND >> THANK YOU.\nYOU TOO. >> OKAY SO IS THERE A REAL\nEFFORT ON EITHER SIDE TO SUPPRESS THE VOTE AND COULD THAT\nEVEN WORK?

THAT'S OKAY?\n>> NO, CHRIS. NO, LISTEN, THERE ARE THINGS\nTHAT BOTH CANDIDATES SAY AND DO THAT I DON'T APPROVE OF.\nI DON'T ADOPT EVERYTHING THAT DONALD TRUMP SAYS OR DOES.\nBUT I'M CONFRONTED WITH A CHOICE BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY\nCLINTON. AND I LOOK AT SOME OF THE\nSCANDALS, THE CORRUPTION, THE DISHONESTY THAT COMES FROM\nMRS. CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN, AND I'LL TAKE A GUY LIKE DONALD\nTRUMP, WHO EVEN TALKS ABOUT A RIGGED ELECTION.\nI DON'T KNOW IF HE GOT PHONE CALLS FROM PEOPLE IN TEXAS ABOUT\nTHOSE MACHINES THAT -- I'M NOT THOSE PHONE CALLS OR IN THE\nCAMPAIGN, YOU KNOW, CONTROL CENTER.\nBUT, AMERICANS ARE CONFRONTED WITH WHO IS A BETTER CHOICE?\nAND I THINK THROUGH THIS ELECTION, I DON'T THINK PEOPLE\nARE REALLY INSPIRED BY EITHER CHOICE BUT THEY HAVE TO ANALYZE\nWHO IS THE BEST CANDIDATE WHO IS GOING TO GROW OUR ECONOMY.\nGIVE US RISING WAGES. CRUSH AND DEFEAT ISIS, SECURE\nOUR BOARD HE, ALL ISSUES THAT WE CARE ABOUT IN WISCONSIN.\nAND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS COMES DOWN TO.\nSO YOU SEE THINGS HAPPENING FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE CAMPAIGNS THAT\nWE MIGHT NOT APPROVE OF AS AMERICANS BUT THE BOTTOM LINE\nIS, WHO IS THE BEST ONE TO LEAD THE COUNTRY FORWARD?\n>> PAUL RYAN WHO IS A FRIEND OF YOURS AND YOU KNOW HIM FELLOW\nWISCONSINERNESS, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, WON'T CAMPAIGN FOR TRUMP\nTHERE HE'S DOING THE DOWN BALLOT RACES MAKING SURE THE PARTY\nSTAYS IN CONTROL OF THE HOUSE HOPEFULLY THE SENATE AS WELL I'M\nSURE HE IS DOING THAT. WHY?\nBECAUSE HE SAYS IN SO MANY WORDS THAT HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO LIVE\nWITH THIS DECISION AFTERWARDS. HOW ARE YOU WITH THAT,\nCONGRESSMAN? ARE YOU CONFIDENT THAT DONALD\nTRUMP WILL NOT SAY OR DO SOMETHING IF PRESIDENT OF THE\nUNITED STATES THAT WILL MAKE YOU REGRET WHAT YOU'RE DOING RIGHT\nNOW TO PUT HIM IN THAT POSITION? >> I'LL COME BACK TO PAUL RYAN\nIN A SECOND. BUT I CAN'T SAY THAT I COULD\nVOTE FOR HILLARY CLINTON AND SHE WON'T SAY AND DO THINGS THAT\nLEAD ME TO BELIEVE THAT SHE USES THE POWER OF THE PRESIDENCY TO\nPERSONALLY BENEFIT HER OWN FAMILY.\nOR THAT SHE'S GOING TO KEEP OUR TOP SECRET INFORMATION SAFE.\nTHOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT WE'RE CONFRONTED WITH.\nBUT BACK TO PAUL RYAN, I MEAN PAUL IS CONFRONTED NOT JUST\nRUNNING FOR CONGRESS IN SOUTHEAST WISCONSIN, PAUL IS\nRESPONSIBLE AS THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF DRIVING A MESSAGE\nABOUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT IDEAS ARE WE BRINGING TO THE AMERICAN\nPEOPLE THAT CAN FIX THE BIG ISSUES THAT CONFRONT OUR COUNTRY\nTODAY? YOU KNOW THIS AND YOU REPORTED\nIT, WE'VE HAD A LOT MORE RACES THAT HAVE COME IN TO PLAY IN\nTHIS OCTOBER, IN THE HOUSE. AND IT'S PAUL'S RESPONSIBILITY\nTO GO OUT THERE AND RAISE MONEY AND MAKE SURE HE BRINGS BACK A\nTEAM THAT IS GOING TO FIGHT FOR COMMONSENSE PRINCIPLES TO REDUCE\nREGULATION, FIX OUR TAX CODE, AND -- AND SO I THINK IT'S\nSMART, HEY I'M GOING TO PIVOT AWAY FROM MR. TRUMP AND FOCUS ON\nMY JOB AS A SPEAKER AND AS A REPUBLICAN MEMBER OF CONGRESS TO\nRAISE MONEY AND FIGHT FOR MY MEMBERS, TO MAKE SURE THEY GO --\n>> YOU KNOW IT'S MORE THAN THAT. YOU KNOW BETTER THAN I DO.\nYOU KNOW HIM WELL. YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS ABOUT\nCONSCIENCE VERSUS CONVENIENCE. YES, YOU SHOULD BACK YOUR\nNOMINEE. THAT'S EASIER.\nIT'S GOING TO BE EASIER WITHIN THE PARTY ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG\nSTARS LIKE YOU. YOU KNOW WHO DOESN'T WANT YOU\nKNOW WHO WHO'S THERE'S NO REASON FOR YOU WANT TO MAKE TROUBLE FOR\nYOURSELF THAT YOU DON'T CREATE YOURSELF.\nBUT HE'S MAKING A DIFFERENT DECISION.\nHE'S SAYING NO I DON'T BUY IT. I DON'T WANT TO OWN IT.\nI DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT I'M ABOUT THE SAME THINGS THAT\nDONALD TRUMP IS. I'M GOING TO BE FOR MY PARTY AND\nTHOSE IDEAS. YOU'RE NOT DOING THAT.\n>> HOLD ON. NO, NO, NO.\nSO PAUL RYAN HASN'T WITHDRAWN HIS SUPPORT OR ENDORSEMENT --\n>> NO BUT HE WON'T CAMPAIGN FOR HIM.\nI MEAN WHEN DOES THAT HAPPEN >> HOLD ON.\nIN WISCONSIN WE HAVE A GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY FROM THE SCOTT\nWALKER -- >> TRUE --\n>> -- BEST PARTY IN THE STATE. IN THE COUNTRY.\nAND PAUL RYAN HAS DRIVEN A MILLION DOLLARS INTO OUR GET OUT\nTHE VOTE OPERATION THAT HELPED SENATOR RON JOHNSON BUT ALSO\nHELPED DONALD TRUMP. PAUL IS DOING THINGS THAT TRULY\nHELP GET OUT OUR VOTE THAT HELP DONALD TRUMP.\nNOW HE MIGHT NOT BE HITTING THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL WITH HIM, BUT THE\nTHINGS THAT HE DOES, IS HELPING OUR TICKET UP AND DOWN FROM THE\nTOP TO THE SENATE, TO HOUSE RACES.\nAND AGAIN, IT'S EASY TO COME AT MAE AND SAY, HEY, DUFFY WHY ARE\nYOU SUPPORTING TRUMP LOOK AT ALL THESE BAD THINGS THAT HE SAYS\nAND DOES. WE ALSO HAVE TO BE CONFRONTED\nWITH LOOK AT ALL THE BAD THINGS THAT HILLARY CLINTON DOES.\nYET, DONALD TRUMP HAS THINGS THAT MAKE THE HAIR ON THE BACK\nOF MY NECK STAND UP. BUT HILLARY CLINTON IS CORRUPT,\nUSING AMERICAN POWER FOR HER OWN PERSONAL GAIN.\nTHAT'S AN AFFRONT TO THE AMERICAN SYSTEM.\nYOU MIGHT DISAGREE WITH PEOPLE ON POLICY, AND DECISIONS THAT\nTHEY MAKE, BUT YOU WOULD -- BUT THAT YOU WOULD BRING WEALTH TO\nYOUR FAMILY FROM A POSITION THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE GAVE YOU, I\nTHINK, AMERICANS COMPLETELY REJECT AND I THINK DEMOCRATS\nSHOULD BE CONFRONTED WITH, YOU KNOW, THOSE QUESTIONS.\nI WOULD LOVE PEOPLE TO ASK MORE HOW COULD YOU -- HOW COULD YOU\nSUPPORT A CANDIDATE LIKE HILLARY CLINTON?\nWHO WOULD DESTROY 33,000 E-MAILS, ONE E-MAILS THAT ARE\nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE'S E-MAILS, BUT AFTER YOU GOT A PRESERVATION\nORDER FROM THE CONGRESS TO KEEP THEM AND TURN THEM OVER, SHE\nDESTROYED THEM WITH A BLEACH BIN -- SHE DESTROYED HER CELL\nPHONE. SO WE COULDN'T RECOVER THAT\nINFORMATION. THIS GOES TO THE HEART OF WHO\nSHE IS AS A PERSON -- >> CONGRESSMAN, YOU DO KNOW THAT\nTHE FBI -- YOU DO KNOW THAT THE FBI FOUND HILLARY CLINTON HAD\nNOTHING TO DO WITH STROIG THE E-MAILS THAT WAS DONE BY AN\nINDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR WHO WAS TOLD TO PRESERVE THEM WHO WAS\nTOLD TO DESTROY THEM EARLIER -- >> OH, COME ON, CHRIS.\n>> HEY THEY DID THE INVESTIGATION.\nI'M NOT LOVING A POLITICAL ARGUMENT.\nI LOVE TO SEE PROSECUTIONS, I'M A LAWYER.\nI'M SAYING THEY FOUND IT. THEY GAVE THE GUY AN IMMUNITY\nDEAL HOPING HE WOULD SAY WHAT YOU JUST SAID AND HE DIDN'T.\nTHAT'S WHY THEY COULDN'T BRING A CASE.\nI'M JUST POINTING OUT FACT. >> CHRIS, WHO -- WHOSE E-MAILS\nARE THEY AND WHOSE CELL PHONE WAS IT?\n>> HEARSE. >> HOW DID THIS PERSON GET HER\nPERSONAL CELL PHONE. >> HEARSE.\n>> THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO DESTROY.\nAND IT WAS MULTIPLE CELL PHONES. AND IF YOU WANT TO GO TO THAT\nEXTENT EVEN WITH THE FBI SHE CAME TO CONGRESS, AND SHE TOLD\nUS THAT SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY SECURE PRIVATE INFORMATION ON\nHER SERVER. RIGHT?\nNO AMERICAN SECRETS. WELL, COMEY CAME IN AND SAID NO,\nNO, SHE DID HAVE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION ON HER SERVER.\n>> RIGHT. >> SO SHE LIED TO THE CONGRESS.\nTHAT'S A CRIME. I'M NOT SAYING SHE SHOULD BE\nPROSECUTED. BUT I'M SAYING, LISTEN, WE HAVE\nREAL ISSUES HERE. AND WHETHER -- WHETHER WE WANT\nTO LOOK AT WHAT KIND OF INVESTIGATION WAS DONE BY THE\nFBI, OR WHAT THE DOJ CHOSE TO DO IN REGARD TO PROSECUTION, THAT'S\nA DIFFERENT FACT AND WE KNOW I WAS A PROSECUTOR.\nWE MAKE DECISIONS ALL THE TIME --\n>> I HEAR YOU. >> -- OR NOT.\nNOT WHETHER YOU CAN WIN OR LOSE BUT WHAT IS THE RIGHT THING TO\nDO. >> I HEAR YOU.\n>> THAT'S BESIDE THE POINT OF DID SHE DO THESE THINGS THAT I\nTHINK ARE RELEVANT TO THE AMERICAN VOTER AND THE AMERICAN\nPEOPLE AS THEY GO TO THE BALLOT BOX ON NOVEMBER 8th.\nAND I THINK WE'RE CONSIDERING ALL THESE FACTORS.\n>> CONGRESSMAN -- >> THE GOOD AND THE BAD AND THE\nUGLY OF DONALD TRUMP AND THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY OF\nHILLARY CLINTON. AND THAT'S WHY I THINK GETTING\nTHIS INFORMATION OUT, ALL OF IT, SO WE CAN MAKE AN INFORMED\nDECISION IS A REALLY GOOD THING FOR THE AMERICAN VOTER.\n>> CONGRESSMAN DUFFY, WELL ARGUED.\nGOOD T H \"NEW DAY\" AS ALWAYS.\nTHANK YOU, SIR. >> HEY, THANKS, CHRIS.\n>> ALL RIGHT. ALISYN.\n>> INDEPENDENT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE EVAN McMULLEN HAS A\nCHANCE TO DO SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY.\nTO WIN A STATE AND ITS ELECTORAL VOTES.\nCOULD HE PLAY A PIVOTAL ROLE IN KEEPING DONALD TRUMP OUT OF THE\nWHITE HOUSE?

McMULLEN. >> GOOD MORNING, GREAT TO BE\nWITH YOU ALISYN. >> LET'S LOOK AT THE LATEST\nPOLLS. BECAUSE THEY'RE FASCINATING.\nTHIS IS THE Y-2 ANALYTIC UTAH PRESIDENTIAL POLL.\nIT SHOWS HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP NECK AND NECK AT\n26%, AND YOU NIPPING AT THEIR HEELS AT 22%.\nAND THEN GARY JOHNSON ALL THE WAY DOWN AT 14%, JILL STEIN AT\n1%. BEYOND BEING A NATIVE SON OF\nUTAH, AS YOU ARE, WHAT DO YOU THINK IS RESONATING ABOUT YOU\nWITH VOTERS? >> WELL, WE'RE THE ONLY\nCONSERVATIVE TICKET IN THIS RACE, ALISYN.\nAND UTAH BEFORE IT'S A R STATE, BEFORE IT'S A REPUBLICAN\nSTATE, IT'S A PRINCIPLED CONSERVATIVE STATE.\nPEOPLE HERE CARE ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION.\nTHEY CARE ABOUT THE FUNDAMENTAL TRUTHS AND PRINCIPLES THAT HAVE\nMADE OUR COUNTRY THE MOST POWERFUL AND PROSPEROUS ON\nEARTH. NAMELY THAT ALL MEN AND WOMEN\nARE CREATED EQUAL AND THAT WE ALL HAVE INALIENABLE RIGHTS TO\nLIFE, LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS, AND THEY DON'T SEE\nTHAT OR COMMON DECENCY BEING REFLECTED BY THE REPUBLICAN\nNOMINEE, DONALD TRUMP, AND SO, AS THE CONSERVATIVE PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATE IN THIS RACE, I THINK OUR MESSAGE IS RESONATING HERE.\n>> BUT, BOY, HAVE YOU -- THE BEAR OF SOME CONSERVATIVE MEDIA\nVOICES. LET ME PLAY FOR YOU.\nHERE'S SEAN HANNITY ON FOX EXPRICING HIS IRE TOWARDS YOU.\n>> WHO'S THIS IDIOT THAT'S RUNNING THIRD PARTY THAT'S\nKILLING TRUMP OUT IN UTAH? WHO PUT HIM UP?\nWHAT WAS IT? THE -- THE -- BUSH PEOPLE, THE\nROMNEY PEOPLE? SERIOUSLY?\nREALLY YOU GOING TO ELECT HILLARY BECAUSE WE LOSE UTAH?\n>> I HAVE MORE. HERE'S LOU DOBBS OF FOX BUSINESS\nNETWORK WHO TWEETED THIS, LOOK DEEPER AT HIM.\nHE'S NOTHING BUT A GLOBALIST. ROMNEY AND NORMAN MAFIA TOOL.\nWHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT? >> WELL, IT'S ALL -- IT'S ALL\nINTERESTING. BUT IT'S INTERESTING THAT THESE\nPEOPLE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES SO-CALLED CONSERVATIVES,\nESPECIALLY SEAN HANNITY, WOULD SO ATTACK US.\nYOU KNOW HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF AT THIS POINT, WHAT DO THESE MEN\nREALLY STAND FOR? DO THEY STAND FOR CONSERVATISM?\nDO THEY STAND FOR THE TIMELESS TRUTHS ON WHICH THIS COUNTRY WAS\nFOUNDED? WHY WOULD THEY STAND WITH DONALD\nTRUMP IF THEY'RE TRUE, AS HE ATTACKS PEOPLE BASED ON THEIR\nFAITH, THEIR RACE, THEIR GENDER. YOU HAVE TO WONDER, ARE THEY\nREALLY CONSERVATIVE, AND IN FACT I THINK WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES\nWHAT DOES THE REPUBLICAN PARTY STAND FOR ANYMORE?\nRIGHT NOW WE HAVE MOST ELECTED OFFICIALS WITH THE PARTY\nSTANDING WITH DONALD TRUMP, EVEN AS HE BRAGS ABOUT THE SEXUAL\nASSAULT OF WOMEN. EVEN AS HE ALIGNS HIMSELF WITH\nBASHAR AL ASSAD, AND PUTIN. THIS IS A GUY WHO I THINK IS\nREALLY DEMONSTRATING THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS LOST ITS\nWAY AND ABANDONED ITS CORE PRINCIPLES.\n>> BUT SPEAKING OF FAITH, I MEAN WHAT DOES MORMON MAFIA TOOL EVEN\nMEAN? >> WELL, I'VE ASKED THAT SAME\nQUESTION, ALISYN. I'D REALLY LOVE IF LOU DOBBS\nWOULD HAVE ME ON, AND I WOULD LOVE TO ASK HIM THAT VERY\nQUESTION. I'D LOVE TO HEAR HIM DESCRIBE\nEXACTLY WHAT IS THE MORMON MAFIA.\nI THINK IT WOULD BE PRETTY INTERESTING TO HEAR.\nI DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS. BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT IT\nISN'T SURPRISING THAT A SUPPORTER OF DONALD TRUMP, NOT\nTHAT THEY'RE ALL THIS WAY I WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR, BUT THE\nHALLMARK OF DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN TO ATTACK\nPEOPLE BASED ON THEIR RACE AND RELIGION AND ALL OF THIS.\nAND SO IT'S NOT A SURPRISE TO ME AT ALL.\nWE'RE KIND OF HAVING FUN WITH IT.\nBUT THE TRUTH IS THAT THIS COUNTRY IS FOR EVERYONE.\nTHIS COUNTRY IS FOR PEOPLE OF ALL RACES AND RELIGIONS, AND\nCERTAINLY BOTH GENDERS ARE EQUAL AND SHOULD BE TREATED AS SUCH.\nTHAT'S SOMETHING THAT IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE\nNO BUSINESS LEADING THIS COUNTRY, AND I ACTUALLY HAVE THE\nSAME CRITICISM OF THOSE WHO ARE STANDING WITH DONALD TRUMP FROM\nTHE REPUBLICAN PARTY NOW. IT'S TRULY UNFORTUNATE IF\nTHEY'RE NOT GOING TO STAND UP FOR AMERICANS WHO ARE BEING\nATTACKED ON THESE GROUNDS, THEIR RELIGION, THEIR GENDER, THEIR\nRACE, WHAT GOOD ARE THEY FOR LEADERSHIP OF OUR COUNTRY?\n>> WELL, BUT, I MEAN I THINK THE SEAN HANNITY'S POINT IS THAT\nYOU'RE ACTUALLY SIPHONING VOTES AWAY FROM DONALD TRUMP, AND\nTHEREBY HELPING TO ELECT HILLARY CLINTON.\nARE YOU COMFORTABLE WITH THAT BEING THE POSSIBLE OUTCOME?\n>> WELL, I ABSOLUTELY REJECT THAT IDEA SO FUNDAMENTALLY.\nLOOK, WE HAVE A PRIVILEGE AND A RIGHT IN THIS COUNTRY TO RUN FOR\nOFFICE. I'M AVAILING MYSELF OF THAT\nRIGHT WITH MY RUNNING MATE. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING.\nAND WE'RE STANDING UP FOR CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES.\nNOW, WE'VE GOT TO GET AWAY FROM THIS IDEA THAT WE HAVE TO VOTE\nFOR EITHER ONE OR TWO -- OR ONE OF THE TWO MAJOR PARTY\nCANDIDATES. THIS YEAR THEY'VE GIVEN US\nHILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP.\nTWO PEOPLE WHO I THINK ARE DEEPLY CORRUPT, AND UNFIT, AND\nSELF-SERVING. THESE ARE NOT THE KIND OF\nLEADERS WE NEED IN THIS COUNTRY. THIS IS THE GREATEST COUNTRY ON\nEARTH AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE A BRIGHT FUTURE.\nBUT WE NEED LEADERS WHO ARE HONEST AND WISE, WHO WILL UPHOLD\nOUR CONSTITUTION, AND RESPECT THE EQUALITY AND LIBERTY OF ALL.\n>> I ONLY HAVE A FEW SECONDS LEFT.\nWHAT IF YOU WIN UTAH BUT LOSE THE PRESIDENCY?\nTHEN WHAT? >> WE'RE BUILDING A NEW\nCONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT AND WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THAT.\nREGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS ON NOVEMBER 8th.\nOBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO DO AS WELL AS POSSIBLE.\nBUT IT'S TIME FOR A NEW CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT IN THIS\nCOUNTRY THAT WILL BE OPEN TO PEOPLE OF ALL RACES AND\nRELIGIONS AND BOTH GENDERS WILL WELCOME MILLENNIALS INTO THE\nFOLD. THIS IS THE FUTURE.\nWE'RE WINNING THE MILLENNIALS HERE IN UTAH BY A LARGE MARGIN\nEVEN OVER HILLARY CLINTON SO THAT'S THE FUTURE.\nTHAT'S WHAT WE'RE BUILDING. AND I BELIEVE THAT'S THE KIND OF\nLEADERSHIP THIS COUNTRY NEEDS. >> EVAN McMULLIN GREAT TO GET\nYOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THESE POSITIONS.\nTHANKS SO MUCH FOR TALKING TO US.\n>> LET'S GET TO CHRIS. >> ALL RIGHT, SO TRUMP KEEPS\nSAYING THE ELECTION IS RIGGED. BUT CLINTON WARNS IT'S AN EFFORT\nTO KEEP HER SUPPORTERS HOME ON ELECTION DAY.\nIS THAT TRUE? THERE IS A BASIS.\nWE'LL DISCUSS IT NEXT WITH SENATOR CLAIRE McCASKILL.",

WHAT ARE WE SEEING ON THAT\nVIDEO? >> I MEAN, IN THAT VIDEO AND WE\nMADE THAT A COUPLE MONTHS EARLIER.\nWHAT WE REALLY WANTED TO CAPTURE WAS THE REPORTERS THAT COVER\nDONALD TRUMP. IN A WAY WE REALIZE WE'RE\nHEARING THESE SLURS SHOUTED OUT PROUDLY AND CASUALLY ABOUT WOMEN\nAND HISPANICS AND AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND, SO, WHAT\nYOU'RE HEARING THERE ARE TRUMP SUPPORTERS WHO ARE GETTING VERY\nFRENZIED, VERY WOUND UP AND SORT OF SHOUTING THINGS THAT I THINK\nIF THEY WERE EVEN TO SEE THEMSELVES ON VIDEO THEY MIGHT\nNOT NECESSARILY BE PROUD OF IN A DIFFERENT MOMENT.\n>> JASON, WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL?\n>> I'VE BEEN TO RALLIES BACK IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND I HEAR A\nDIFFERENT TONE NOW. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE\nDON'T SEE WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING ON TELEVISION A TRUMP RALLY,\nUSUALLY THE WARM--UP ACTS. OFTENTIMES THESE ARE STIRRING UP\nEMOTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, I WAS AT A RALLY IN\nCINCINNATI RECENTLY. A FORMER LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER\nAND AN ALLY OF DONALD TRUMP SAYING THINGS IN EVEN HARSHER\nTERMS THAN YOU SOMETIMES HEAR FROM DONALD TRUMP THAT THIS\nSYSTEM IS CORRUPT. IF HILLARY CLINTON WINS, ACTION\nWILL NEED TO BE TAKEN. >> THE WARM-UP ACT WORKS THE\nCROWD UP AND BY THE TIME DONALD TRUMP COMES ON, THEY'RE SORT OF\nVERY AGITATED. >> VERY MUCH SO.\nWHEN I WAS AT ONE OF THESE RALLIES, YOU GO AROUND TALKING\nTO PEOPLE AS A JOURNALIST SOMETIMES PEOPLE ARE VERY\nSUSPICIOUS OF YOU AND, SO, THEY'LL BE CONFRONTATIONAL WITH\nYOU AT TIMES. ONE PERSON I SPOKE WITH AT A\nRALLY, HE SAID THINGS THAT WERE RATHER ALARMING.\n>> SUCH AS? >> HE SAID THAT IF HILLARY\nCLINTON WINS, THAT HE MAY HAVE TO TAKE ACTIONS AS A PATRIOT.\nI FOLLOWED UP ON THAT. WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT?\nI ASKED HIM BLUNTLY, DOES THAT MEAN YOU FEEL IT'S OKAY TO\nASSASSINATE A PRESIDENT AND HE ANSWERED MY QUESTION WITH A\nQUESTION OF HIS OWN. WHAT IF THE PRESIDENT IS\nCORRUPT? WELL, YOU KNOW --\n>> WE PLAYED YOUR VIDEO. WE SAW THAT.\nIT WAS A SCARY MOMENT TO HEAR THAT PEOPLE NOW, SOME PEOPLE,\nFEEL THAT TAKING ACTION, VIOLENT ACTION IS ALMOST THEIR DUTY.\nIF YOU'RE A PATRIOT, IT'S YOUR DUTY TO DO SOMETHING, YOU'RE\nRIGHTING A WRONG. >> LET'S HOPE THESE ARE JUST\nWORDS. BUT LET'S ALSO HOPE THAT WORDS\nLIKE THIS, THIS KIND OF LANGUAGE ISN'T ISN'T FEEDING THE DARK\nFANTASIES OF UNHINGED INDIVIDUALS.\n>> ASHLEY, WHAT ABOUT THE RECORDED VIDEOS THAT WE SAW THAT\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HBECAUSE THEE WERE PART OF HILLARY CLINTON OR\nTHE DNC CAMPAIGN THESE VARITAUS VIDEOS AND DID YOU EVER SEE\nANYTHING LIKE THAT? >> I HAVE TO SAY I PERSONALLY\nDID NOT SEE ANYTHING LIKE THAT. BUT, ALL ALONG, WHEN IN COVERING\nDONALD TRUMP WE'VE SEEN THE PHENOMENON THAT WE HAVE NOT\nSESEEN WITH ANY OTHER CANDIDATE THAT\nPROTESTERS ARE A HUGE PART OF THE EXPERIENCE OF ATTENDING A\nDONALD TRUMP RALLY. ALMOST LIKE THE CALLS TO BUILD\nTHE WALL WITH MEXICO. SO, WHAT I HAVE SEEN, CERTAINLY,\nARE PROTESTERS COMING IN AND DELIBERATELY DISRUPTING HIS\nEVENTS. YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES RESISTING\nBEING CARRIED OUT. AND THEN I'VE ALSO SEEN THE\nCOUNTER SIDE OF THAT WHICH IS THE CROWD REALLY TURNING ON\nTHESE PROTESTERS OFTEN WITH NASTY LANGUAGE FROM BOTH THE\nPROTESTERS AND THE CROWD AND VIOLENCE.\nAND THAT IS JUST WHAT YOU EXPECT TO SEE AT A DONALD TRUMP RALLY.\nHE HOLDS IT UP AS AN EXAMPLE OF ISN'T THIS SO MUCH FUN TO BE\nHERE AT A TRUMP RALLY. >> JASON, VERY QUICKLY, FROM\nYOUR EXPERIENCE OF REPORTING, WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO\nHAPPEN IF DONALD TRUMP WERE TO LOSE ON NOVEMBER 8th, WHAT\nHAPPENS TO HIS MOVEMENT BECAUSE PEOPLE DO FEEL THEY ARE A PART\nOF A MOVEMENT. >> WIN OR LOSE, I THINK THE\nSPEECH TO WATCH ON ELECTION NIGHT IS DONALD TRUMP'S.\nDOES HE PRESENT IT? IF HE WERE TO LOSE, DOES HE\nPRESENT IT AS A FAILURE OF DEMOCRACY.\nIF THAT HAPPENS, THAT COULD REALLY FAN THE FLAMES OF SOME OF\nHIS FOLLOWERS WHO, AS WE'VE SEEN, FEEL LIKE THE SYSTEM IS\nCORRUPT AND THAT MAY LEAD TO SOME TYPE OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE.\n>> JASON, ASHLEY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SHARING YOUR REPORTING\nWITH US.

OF COURSE, THERE'S BEEN\nCONTROVERSY SURROUNDING ALL THIS AND INJECTED INTO THE 2016 RACE.\nU.S. OFFICIALS SAY THEY DO BELIEVE RUSSIA IS RESPONSIBLE\nAND BEHIND THOSE. NOW, THERE'S THIS NEW REPORT\nTHAT SHOWS OTHER COUNTRIES MAY BE HACKING BACK AT VLADIMIR\nPUTIN. JOINING US NOW TO TALK ABOUT ALL\nOF THIS NEW YORK CONGRESSMAN STEVE ISRAEL.\nHE RECENTLY WROTE A PIECE FOR CNN WARNING IN THE MEDIA OF WHAT\nHE CALLS THE WEAPONIZATION OF THE HACKED E-MAILS.\nCONGRESSMAN, THANKS FOR BEING HERE.\n>> GOOD MORNING. THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON.\n>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN THE E-MAILS HAVE BECOME WEAPONIZED.\n>> YOU KNOW, LOOK, PEOPLE SHOULD REACH WHATEVER JUDGMENT THEY\nWANT ON THIS, BUT I BELIEVE GOOD, BAD OR INDIFFERENT.\nI BELIEVE THOSE SHOULD BE WARNED BY CERTAIN FACTS.\nWE NOW KNOW THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY\nAND OUR OWN INTELLIGENCE EXPERTS AND PRIVATE CYBERSECURITY FIRMS\nTHAT RUSSIA HAS HACKED INTO OUR SYSTEMS.\nTHAT RUSSIA HAS DUMPED THESE E-MAILS AND NOT ONLY THAT, BUT\nRUSSIA HAS A TENDENCY OF DUMPING THESE E-MAILS AND THEN DOCTORING\nTHEM. FALSIFYING THEM.\nSO, THIS IS A FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE EFFORT TO SO\nDISCORD INTO OUR SYSTEMS TO DISCREDIT CANDIDATES BEFORE AN\nELECTION AND TO INFLUENCE THAT ELECTION.\n>> SO, ARE YOU SAYING, CONGRESSMAN, THAT EVERYTHING\nTHAT WE'VE SEEN ON THESE E-MAILS YOU DON'T TRUST THE VERACITY OF.\nYOU DON'T THINK WE'RE GETTING THE REAL STORY OF THE CLINTON\nFOUNATION OR DOUG BAND OR THE COMPLICATIONS OF FUND-RAISING\nBECAUSE THAT STUFF IS SUBSTANTIAL AND IT'S WORTH\nTALKING ABOUT. >> WELL, I'M NOT SURE THAT SOME\nOF THAT IS WORTH TALKING ABOUT. I MEAN GOSSIPY STUFF, SALACIOUS\nSTUFF, I'M NOT SURE THAT HAS A BEARING ON WHO THE NEXT\nPRESIDENT SHOULD BE. HILLARY CLINTON OR DONALD TRUMP.\nEVEN IF YOU BELIEVE THAT, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR VOTERS\nTO HAVE THAT JUDGMENT INFORMED BY THE FACT THAT THIS IS A\nFOREIGN INTELLIGENCE OPERATION BEING RUN AGAINST THE UNITED\nSTATES OF AMERICA. SO, ALL OF THOSE E-MAILS,\nWHETHER YOU AGREE WITH THEM OR NOT.\nWHETHER THEY AFFECT YOUR VOTE OR NOT, ALL OF THEM SHOULD COME\nWITH A CAUTIONARY ASTERISK. RUSSIA HAS DONE THIS IN ESTONIA\nAND UKRAINE AND THEY NOT ONLY RELEASE THESE DOCUMENTS, BUT\nDOCTOR THESE DOCUMENTS. I THINK VOTERS SHOULD BE ADVISED\nOF THAT. >> THIS MORNING YOU'RE 100%\nCERTAIN THAT RUSSIA IS BEHIND THIS?\n>> NOT ONLY AM I 100% CERTAIN, BUT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES HAS SAID THAT RUSSIA IS BEHIND THIS.\nIF YOU DON'T BELIEVE HIM, THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY\nHAS SAID. IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE THE\nDEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY, WE HAVE ABOUT 15 BIPARTISAN\nNATIONAL SECURITY OFFICIALS, INCLUDING OFFICIALS FROM THE\nBUSH ADMINISTRATION WHO AGREE THAT RUSSIA IS BEHIND THIS AND\nVIRTUALLY EVERY MAJOR CYBERSECURITY FIRM SAYS THE\nSAME. >> SO, WHY DOESN'T DONALD TRUMP\nBELIEVE THAT? >> WELL, BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP IS\nTHE BENEFICIARY OF THIS FOREIGN INTELLIGENT OPERATION.\nLET'S BE CLEAR PUTIN IS BEHIND THIS AND DOING THIS TO INFLUENCE\nTHIS ELECTION. DONALD TRUMP IS THE BENEFICIARY\nOF THIS FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE OPERATION.\nWHY WOULD HE CONDEMN IT OR CRITICIZE IT?\nHE'S BEEN AIDING AND ABETTING IT.\n>> RUSSIA HAS DENIED, BY THE WAY, BEING PART OF THIS HACK.\nTHEY SAY THEY'RE AMUSED THAT WE'RE ELEVATING THEM TO THIS\nLEVEL THAT THEY COULD POSSIBLE SEW CHAOS IN OUR PRESIDENTIAL\nELECTION. IF ALL THOSE INVESTIGATIVE\nAGENCIES ARE RIGHT AND RUSSIA DID DO THIS, WHY DO THEY WANT\nDONALD TRUMP TO WIN? >> WELL, BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE HE\nWILL BE PLIABLE. DONALD TRUMP HAS EFFECTIVELY\nENDORSED VLADIMIR PUTIN. VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS TALKED ABOUT\nHIS ADMIRATION FOR DONALD TRUMP. BY THE WAY, PUTIN'S DENIALS OF\nTHIS HOLD NO WATER. HE IS BOMBING HOSPITALS IN\nALEPPO AND SAID HE DIDN'T AND INVADED CRUCRUMEA AND SAID HE\nDIDN'T. >> CONGRESSMAN STEVE ISRAEL,\nPEOPLE CAN GO TO CNN.COM TO READ YOUR OP-ED ON WHY YOU THINK THIS\nIS SUCH AN IMPORTANT ISSUE IN THIS CAMPAIGN.\nTHANKS SO MUCH FOR SHARING IT WITH US.\n>> THANK YOU.",

AN AD.\nBUT AT SOME POINT I GUESS WE DIDN'T PLAY IT WHERE IT CONNECTS\nTO DONALD TRUMP OR TO HILLARY CLINTON.\nYOU HAVE TO SORT OF BRING THAT HOME TO THE CANDIDATE --\n>> I THINK HILLARY CLINTON'S ADS HAVE BEEN LARGELY FOCUSED ON\nEMOTIONAL APPEALS.

      "text": "FRIEND.\n>>> DONALD TRUMP TOURED THE BATTLEGROUND OF OHIO WHERE HE\nSPOKE OF RECENT WIKILEAK REVELATIONS THAT PROVE THE\nCLINTONS ARE CORRUPT. HE SAID THE ELECTION SHOULD BE\nCANCELED AND JUST HANDED TO HIM. >> THAT WOULD BE EASY, WOULDN'T\nIT? CLINTON ALMOST DOUBLED HER LEAD\nDOUBLY OVER TRUMP IN A SURVEY. TRUMP TRAILS CLINTON BY NINE\nPOINTS. STEVE LIESMAN HAS MORE ON THE\nSURVEY. >> 804 AMERICANS POLLED ACROSS\nTHE COUNTRY, ALL DEMOGRAPHICS, ALL RACES, ALL INCOME GROUPS.\nLET'S SHOW YOU THE OVERALL RESULTS.\n17% UNDECIDED, THAT'S DOWN 8% FROM THE JUNE POLL.\n37% FOR TRUMP. 46% FOR CLINTON.\nCLINTON HAS NEARLY DOUBLED HER LEAD WITH THE UNDECIDEDS, PLUS\nSIX FOR HER COMPARED TO JUNE, TRUMP, PLUS 2%.\nLET'S MOVE ON AND LOOK. CLINTON HAS REALLY WIDENED HER\nLEAD ON KEY ECONOMIC ISSUES. ON THE OVERALL ECONOMY, SHE WAS\nUP BY ONE IN JUNE. NOW UP BY FIVE.\nTHAT BREAKS 43 TO 38. ON TRADE, SHE WAS UP BY NINE,\nREMAINS UP BY NINE. THIS BIG TRADE ISSUE FOR TRUMP,\nNOT SO BIG WHEN IT COMES TO THE POLLS.\nON BUSINESS REGULATIONS, SHE'S UP NOW ON THE BUDGET DEFICIT\nSHE'S UP AND ON THE STOCK MARKET, SHE HAD A 16 POINT\nDEFICIT, NOW SHE'S SEEN UP ONE OR CALL IT JUST EVEN, WITH OUR\nDEMOCRATIC POLLSTERS, OUR DEMOCRATIC POLLSTERS SAY TRUMP\nCANNOT CAPITALIZE ON THE ONE THING HE HAD GOING FOR HIM WHICH\nWAS AS A BUSINESSMAN. ON THE ISSUE OF TAXES, 43% OF\nAMERICANS THINK SHE'LL RAISE THE TAXES, ABOUT EVEN ON THE\nDEFICIT. HE'S BEEN UNABLE TO CAPITALIZE\nON THAT BIG ECONOMIC ISSUE. >> GINA SANCHEZ IS IN THE STUDIO\nWITH US. GOOD MORNING.\n>> GOOD MORNING. >> SO, WE WERE HEARING SOME OF\nTHE LATEST POLLS THERE FROM STEVE.\nA GUEST EARLIER SAID HE THINKS IT IS POSSIBLE THAT TRUMP CAN\nSTILL WIN. REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE POLLS ARE\nSAYING. >> I WOULD DOUBT THAT, BUT WHAT\nI WOULD SAY IS THAT PEOPLE HAVE  VOTERS.\nTHE REASON I DOUBT IT IS BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE CURRENTLY\nBACKING TRUMP ARE A SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION THAT TEND NOT TO\nVOTE. SO, IF HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF,\nTHESE ARE PEOPLE WHO DON'T MAKE IT OUT TO THE VOTING POLLS ON\nTHE DAY OF. SO THERE IS A BIG QUESTION.\nTHE REALITY IS THAT HILLARY HAS BEEN OPENING UP HER LEAD.\nAND YOU HAVE SEEN THE MARKETS TO SOME DEGREE SETTLING DOWN IN\nTERMS OF BEING NERVOUS. SO, I THINK IF A TRUMP WIN WERE\nTO COME FROM OUT OF NOWHERE, THE MARKETS WOULD BE SET UP FOR A\nPRETTY BIG DROP. >> STRANGER THINGS HAVE\nHAPPENED. >> HERE IN BRITAIN ON JUNE\n23rdMENT. >> WE'VE BEEN WRONG IN POLLS\nBEFORE. PEOPLE STAY AWAY FROM VOTING.\nAND YOU HAVE A THIRD PARTY COMING IN INSTEAD.\nTHAT SKEWS IT. FUNNIER THINGS HAVE HAPPENED.\nI GUESS FROM THE MATH IN TERMS OF THE POPULOUS STATES THAT\nTRADITIONALLY ARE DEMOCRAT, THAT HILLARY OR HAVE HILLARY'S\nBACKING NOW, THAT TRUMP WOULD NOT ONLY HAVE TO MAKE HEADWIND\nIN A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT STATES ALREADY, BUT ALSO THOSE STATES\nTHAT HILLARY IS ALREADY RUNNING OFF WITH SO FAR.\n>> THAT'S TRUE. THE POINT I WANT TO DRIVE HOME\nWITH INVESTORS IS THAT THE MARKET IS LARGELY PRICED FOR A\nHILLARY WIN. YOU HAD NATE SILVER COME OUT\nSAYING, LOOK, THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT THERE IS STILL A\nNON-ZERO CHANCE THAT TRUMP COULD WIN.\nIT'S LOW, BUT NOT OUT OF THE REALM OF POSSIBILITY AT THIS\nPOINT. THE MARKETS ARE SIMPLY NOT\nPRICED FOR THAT. SO, I THINK THAT'S THE ONLY REAL\nTHREAT TO INVESTORS RIGHT NOW. >> WHAT DO WE DO THEN?\nIF IT'S ALREADY PRICED IN, A HILLARY WIN, HOW DO WE POSITION\nIN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS? DO WE DO ANYTHING AT ALL?\nHAS EVERYTHING BEEN DONE SO FAR? >> THERE ARE A FEW OTHER FACTORS\nTHAT WILL BE PUSHING THE MARKETS IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.\nSO I THINK THE HILLARY WIN COULD SET US UP FOR A RALLY, BUT TO\nTHE DEGREE IT'S ALREADY PRICED IN, THAT RALLY MIGHT BE MUTED.\nWHAT COULD HELP IS THAT WE'RE STARTING TO SEE OPTIMISM, UPWARD\nREVISIONS IN EARNINGS AND POTENTIALLY THE END OF THE\nEARNINGS SESSION. THAT COULD BE BENEFICIAL.\nWE ARE ALSO EXPECTING THE FED TO TAKE ONE HIKE.\nWILL THAT BE THE END OF THE WORLD?\nNO, BUT IT MEANS THE DOLLAR STRENGTHENED.\nTHE DOLLAR IS PUTTING PRESSURE ON EARNINGS.\nWE HAVE OPPOSING FORCES HERE. I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY\nYOU'LL SEE A RALLY, IT WILL BE A MUTED RALLY.\n>> I WAS THINKING WHETHER OR NOT WE STILL HAVE AN EARNINGS\nRECESSION. IT SEEMS NOW, AT LEAST WHEN\nLOOKING AT EUROPEAN COMPANIES REPORTING, THEY'RE SAYING THERE\nIS TRANSPARENCY IN 2017 AND WE HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT'S\nHAPPENING, OR CEOs WHO ARE SAYING WE'RE FINING IT MURKY\nSTILL AND DIFFICULT TO SEE THINK HOW 2017 WILL LOOK.\nIF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA AND CURRENT REVISIONS, THE REVISIONS\nARE TAKING US UP TO ABOUT A 2% GROWTH RATE IN EARNINGS, NOT\nGREAT, BUT STILL NOT NEGATIVE. ADDRESS YOU'VE SEEN OVER THE\nLAST FEW QUARTERS, WHILE WE'VE BEEN IN A RECESSION, WE'VE BEEN\nGETTING LESS AND LET'S NEGATIVE, A PRECURSOR TO POSITIVE.\nWE'VE BEEN MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.\nMOST OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE ENERGY SECTOR.\nTHE PROBLEM IS OIL CONTINUES IN ITS RANGE.\nWE'VE TRADED UP TO THE TOP OF THE RANGE, BROKE 50.\nUNLESS WE SEE SOME MAJOR NEWS OUT OF THIS OPEC MEETING, WHICH\nQUITE FRANKLY I DON'T ANTICIPATE, I THINK WE'LL LIKELY GET DISAPPOINTMENT AND TRADE\nBACK DOWN TO 40. I DON'T THINK OIL GOES ANYWHERE.\nTHAT PUT US IN THIS EARNINGS RECESSION.\n>> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS RECENT BOOST IN YIELDS?\nWHETHER IT'S IN EUROPE, IN THE GILT MARKET, TREASURIES.\n>> THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE DOLLAR AND THAT'S CONSISTENT\nWITH THE EXPECTATION THAT THE FED WILL RAISE RATES.\nNOW, PROBABLY NOT UNTIL FEBRUARY.\nPROBABLY ONLY ONCE AND IT WILL PROBABLY BE UP NINE MONTHS\nBEFORE ANOTHER HIKE. I THINK EVERYBODY IS TRYING TO\nEXIT OUT OF THIS EASY MONETARY POLICY AS SLOWLY AS POSSIBLE\nBECAUSE THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS IT HAS HAD TREMENDOUS\nIMPLICATIONS, ONE OF WHICH HAS BEEN TO BOOST PEs OVER THE LAST\nMANY YEARS. SO SOME OF THAT WILL BE TAKEN\nOFF THE TABLE. I WAS TALKING WITH A COLLEAGUE\nWHO SAID THE PERFECT SOLUTION FOR THE FED WOULD BE TO TAKE\nAWAY MONETARY POLICY AT THE POINT WHEN EARNINGS START TO\nREPAIR. IF YOU CAN DO THAT PERFECTLY,\nTHEN PE SHOULD MOVE SIDEWAYS. BUT THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE WHAT\nHAPPENS. >> SOUNDS EASY.\n>> YEAH. >> GINA, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nGINA SANCHEZ, CEO AFTER CHANTICO",

WE HAVE A LONG WAYS TO GO TO\nBROADLY PROTECT CONSUMERS AS MORE AND MORE DEVICES ARE\nCONNECTED, AND CAN OPERATE IN CONJUNCTION WITH A BROADER\nCYBERATTACK. >> DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH\nMORE HACKING WE SEE NOW COMPARED TO TWO YEARS AGO?\nFIVE YEARS AGO? >> THE LINE IS INSANELY HIGH.\nTHERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT STATS OUT THERE.\nMOTIVATIONS HAVE GROWN SO HIGH, BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT JUST STEALING\nINFORMATION, YOU'RE TRYING TO EXPOSE OR EMBARRASS OR DISABLE\nWHAT WE SAW WITH THE ATTACK LAST WEEK.\nSO, WHILE THE NUMBERS ARE TO THE GREAT, CONSUMERS SHOULD THINK\nTHIS IS MUCH, MUCH WORSE THAN IT'S EVER BEEN.\n>> I ALWAYS FIND IS INTERESTING, IF YOU'RE A COMPANY AND BEEN\nHACKED, FOR EXAMPLE, OR AN ORGANIZATION, DO YOU WANT IT\nKNOWN THAT YOU HAVE BEEN HACKED AND THAT YOU KNOW WHO HACKED\nYOU? OR DO YOU TRY TO HACK BACK?\nI KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LEGALITIES HERE, BUT IN TERMS OF\nHOW THINGS MUST OPERATE BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A HACKING WORLD.\n>> YEAH. THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF HACK BACK,\nMEANING A COMPANY IS GOING TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST THE HACKERS,\nTHAT'S A VERY COMPLEX SET OF DECISIONS.\nOFTENTIMES IT'S ILLEGAL. >> YEAH.\n>> BECAUSE IT CAN BE AN ACT OF WAR.\nIF THE HACKER ON THE OTHER SIDE IS REPRESENTING A FOREIGN STATE,\nYOU HAVE TO BE EXTREMELY THOUGHTFUL.\nSO, WHILE HACK BACK SOUNDS GREAT, IT REALLY ISN'T A REALITY\nFOR MOST COMPANIES TODAY. SO, WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN IS THERE\nNEEDS TO BE BETTER COOPERATION BETWEEN PRIVATE ENTERPRISE,\nGOVERNMENTS, AND THEN CROSS-GOVERNMENT COOPERATION.\nYOU MENTIONED IT COULD BE AN ACT OF WAR.\nWE'VE SEEN NATION STATES HACKING EACH OTHER.\nARE WE AT A POENT WHERE WE'RE IN A CYBERSECURITY WAR HERE?\nHACKING WAR? >> I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE IN A\nHACKING WAR BUT AN UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL OF HACKING ACTIVITY.\nWHAT WE NEED TO SEE IS, AGAIN, BROADER COOPERATION BETWEEN\nPRIVATE ENTERPRISE AND GOVERNMENTS.\nWE NEED TO SEE BROADER COOPERATION BETWEEN GOVERNMENTS\nTHEMSELVES. BECAUSE THIS REPRESENTS A\nSIGNIFICANT ISSUE TO CONSUMERS WORLDWIDE.\nAND IT'S GLOBAL, IT'S A CHALLENGE, IT'S ONLY GETTING\nWORSE. >> GARY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\n>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> GARY STEELE, ARGEN, THANKS AS\nWELL. IT'S THE WEEKEND FOR MANY NOW.\nSTAY WITH US. A LOT COMING UP.\n\"WORLDWIDE EXCHANGE\" IS UP RIGHT AFTER THIS PROGRAM.\nLET'S LOOK AT THE U.S. FUTURES AS WELL.\nSETTING OURSELVES UP FOR A SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE START TO THE\nU.S. MARKETS THIS AFTERNOON.

SO IT'S JUST AN IMPACT OF THAT\nSLIGHTLY WEAKER SUMMER MONTHS. WE SEE GOOD DEMAND, CONSUMERS\nARE HAVING MORE DISPOSABLE INCOME.\nHOUSING STARTS ARE CONTINUING TO IMPROVE.\nWE HAVE A GOOD UNDERLYING VIEW ON THE NORTH AMERICAN MARKET.\n>> WHAT'S HAPPENING IN EUROPE? YOU'RE SAYING NOW THAT YOU WILL\nCOME IN IN THE LOWER END OF YOUR GROWTH RANGE OF 2% TO 4%.\n>> THAT'S MAINLY DRIVEN BY THE WEAKER WHOLESALE DEMAND WE'RE\nSEEING IN THE UK, PLUS A BIT SLOWER GROWTH IN THE SOUTHERN\nPARTS OF EUROPE, SPAIN IN PARTICULAR.\nBUT NOT A MAJOR SHIFT OVERALL. MOST MARKETS CONTINUING TO GROW\nIN EUROPE. >> AND I LOOK AT LATIN AMERICA,\nBRAZIL, ARGENTINA. WE ARE LOOKING AT A PRETTY BIG\nDROP THERE. WHY THAT SHIFT?\n>> I THINK WE'RE CONTINUING TO SEE WEAK IN\nBRAZIL AND LATIN AMERICA. WE HAVE UNEMPLOYMENT INCREASING,\nWE SEE ALSO FISCAL OSTERITY.

VERY FEEL COMMITTED TO THAT, OUR\nOVERALL OBJECTIVE IS TO CUT THE TOTAL IMPACT ON GREENHOUSE GAS\nEMISSIONS FROM OUR ACTIVITY AND PRODUCTS BY 50% FROM 2005 TO\n2020. WE'RE ON TRACK TO REACH THAT\nOBJECTIVE. >> ARE CONSUMERS WILLING TO PAY\nMORE FOR GREEN? I DID SPEAK TO ONE OF YOUR\nEXECUTIVES AT AN EVENT A COUPLE MONTHS BACK IN BERLIN, WE WERE\nTALKING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU CAN PASS ON THIS GREEN DIRECTION\nTO CONSUMERS. >> I THINK, FIRST OF ALL, BEING\nPERCEIVED AS A LEADER IN SUSTAINABILITY, WHICH WE ARE,\nHAS A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF OUR BRANDS\nWHICH IS GENERALLY GOOD FOR US. SECONDLY, PEOPLE ARE GENERALLY\nWILLING TO PAY FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY.\nIF WE CAN REDUCE THOSE COSTS, PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PAY FOR\nTHAT. >> WANT TO COME BACK TO NORTH\nAMERICA, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE SEEING WEAKNESS NOW BUT YOU\nDON'T ANTICIPATE THAT WEAKNESS TO STAY BUT YOU ARE SCALING BACK\nFORECASTS. I LOOKED AT THE NORTHWESTERN\nWHITE GOODS MARKET, IT LOOKS LIKE IT HAS FALLEN OFF A CLIFF\nWHEN YOU TAKE THE QUARTER ON QUARTER COMPARISONS.\n>> WE'VE SEEN A COUPLE YEARS OF SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN NORTH\nAMERICA, OVER 8% FOR A FEW YEARS IN A ROW.\nOF COURSE WE'RE SEEING THAT SHIFT DOWN TO THE 3%, 4% RANGE.\nIT'S A NATURAL CHANGE IN THE GROWTH RATE.\nWE DID HAVE SOME WEAK SUMMER MONTHS, BUT AGAIN SEPTEMBER CAME\nBACK. FOR IT'S, THE IMPORTANT PART IS\nTHAT WE UNDERLINE DEMAND DRIVERS IMPORTANT FOR US, SUCH AS\nHOUSEHOLD DISPOSABLE INCOMES, UNEMPLOYMENT RATES, HOUSE EQUITY VALUES, HOUSING STARTS, ALL OF\nTHOSE ARE DEVELOPING IN A FAVORABLE WAY IN AMERICA.\n>> THE INTERNET OF THINGS, THIS INTERCONNECTIVE HOUSEHOLD THAT\nWE'RE HEADED HOUSEHOLD THAT WE'RE HEADED TOWARDS, WHERE OUR\nCOFFEE MACHINE KNOWS THAT WE NEED COFFEE, IT TALKS TO THE\nWASHING MACHINE, IT CAN ORDER WITHOUT US BEING THERE.\nHOW FAR ARE WE FROM BECOMING HAVING DEVICES SO SMART THAT\nTHEY KNOW WHAT WE WANT. >> MOST OF WHAT YOU SEE IS\nPOSSIBLE TO DO, BUT AT A COST THAT IS PROHIBITIVE FOR MOST\nCONSUMERS, AND ALSO THE HASSLE THAT CONSUMERS HAVE TO GO\nTHROUGH TO GET THOSE BENEFITS ARE STILL TOO HIGH.\nTHOSE ARE CHALLENGES THAT WE WILL OVERCOME OVER THE COMING\nYEARS. I THINK THE FUTURE IS VERY MUCH\nDRIVEN BY MAKING CONSUMERS EXPERIENCES EASIER.\nIF YOU CAN TAKE CARE OF YOUR LAUNDRY WITH LESS HASSLE AND\nBETTER RESULTS, IF YOU CAN TAKE CARE OF YOUR COOKING CAN LESS\nHASSLE AND WITH BETTER RESULTS, THOSE ARE THINGS CONSUMERS WANT.\nOUR JOB IS TO PROVIDE THAT WITH THE LEAST -- LOWEST PRICE AND\nWITHOUT HASSLE.

ANALYSTS WERE EXPECTING A NET\nPROFIT OF 945 MILLION FRANCS. JULIA JOINS US NOW.\nSHE'S IN ZURICH. WE'RE LOOKING AT A PROFIT DROP\nIN UBS' YEAR ON YEAR FIGURE,S A NOTING THE RESERVES ON PENALTIES\nLINKED TO THE MISSELLING OF RESIDENTIAL MBSs.\n>> ABSOLUTELY. GOOD MORNING.\nA LOT OF THINGS HERE. AS YOU LOOK ACROSS THE BOARD,\nVERSUS ANALYST EXPECTATIONS, TODAY THEY BEAT OR WERE IN LINE.\nI THINK UBS BELIEVES THIS IS A SOLID LEVEL OF RESULTS, NO\nMATTER WHERE YOU LOOK. WE HAVE THE DILUTED EPS,\nADJUSTED PROFITS BETTER THAN EXPECTED AND THE CHALLENGES THAT\nARE ONGOING FOR THIS BANK AND FOR ALL BANKS HERE IN\nPARTICULAR. AND UBS DON'T SEE THAT GOING\nAWAY ANY TIME SEEN. A BRIGHT SPOT HERE, GIVEN THE\nCHALLENGES OF NEGATIVE RATES, IS WHAT THEY'RE DOING DOMESTICALLY\nIN SWITZERLAND. IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR PERSONAL\nAND CORPORATE PART OF THE BUSINESS, THEY HAVE THE BEST\nQUARTER SINCE 2008. I THINK THIS IS A BRIGHT SPOT.\nOF COURSE THE DIVIDENDS. SOME CONCERNS OUT THERE FOR\nINVESTORS THAT PERHAPS THE DIVIDEND COULD SLIP.\nTHEY HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT 60 CENTS.\nWHEN I SPOKE TO THE CEO HE REITERATED WE'RE STILL ON TRACK\nWITH THAT. THAT'S GIVING INVESTORS COMFORT\nTODAY, TOO. AS YOU MENTIONED, A RISE IN\nPROVISIONS FOR LITIGATION OF 490 MILLION SWISS.\nTHIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE UBS HAS ALSO GOT OUTSTANDING U.S.\nMORTGAGE RELATED LITIGATION ISSUES.\nAND THIS IS WHAT I PICKED UP ON WITH THE CEO.\nI SAID TO WHAT EXTENT OF THOSE NEW PROVISIONS TO DO WITH\nMORTGAGE RELATED ISSUES. LISTEN IN.\n>> THE VAST MAJORITIES ARE NBS RELATED MATTERS.\nWE HAVE DIFFERENT EXPOSURES WE'VE BEEN WORKING THROUGH OVER\nTHE LAST DECADE NOW, AND STILL ONGOING.\nTHAT'S THE VAST MAJORITY OF PROVISIONS.\nARE YOU MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SITUATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF\nJUSTICE IN LIGHT WITH WHAT WE'VE SEEN WITH DEUTSCHE BANK IN THE\nLAST MONTH AND A HALF? >> LOOK, NOT REALLY, BECAUSE\nEVERY SITUATION ON THIS KIND OF MATTER IS DIFFERENT.\nBOTH FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT OF VIEW AND EVERY -- AND EVERY BANK\nMAY HAVE ITS OWN DIFFERENT SITUATION.\nSO, I'M NOT PARTICULARLY CONCERNED BECAUSE OF THAT.\n>> WHAT WE HEAR IS THAT OF ALL THE BANKS THAT ARE HAVING\nDISCUSSIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, YOU'RE KIND OF LOW\nDOWN THE PECKING ORDER. CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT?\n>> WELL, I LOOK -- I'M NOT LOOKING AT ANY KIND OF QUEUE.\nI ALWAYS FEEL THAT IT IS VERY -- IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE\nTIMING OF THE RESOLUTIONS OF THIS KIND OF MATTER.\nAS I SAY. THINGS ARE DIFFERENT BANK BY\nBANK. >> THE RISK IS IF IT GETS PUSHED\nBACK INTO NEXT YEAR, YOU'LL BE DEALING WITH A FRESH\nADMINISTRATION. DO YOU THINK THAT MAKES A\nDIFFERENCE? >> WELL, CALL ME NOSTALGIC, BUT\nI HOPE JUSTICE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH POLITICAL INFLUENCE.\n>> I THINK THE GENERAL BELIEF IS THAT THE LITIGATION ISSUES WILL\nREMAIN A BLACK CLOUD HANGING OVER THE EUROPEAN BANKING\nSECTOR. AND A DRAG ON SHARE PRICES.\nBUT SOMETHING THAT IS ALLOWED OR SEEING SOME ELEMENT OF A RALLY\nIN THE LAST FEW WEEKS HAS BEEN THE STEEPENING OF THE YIELD\nCURVE AND THE PICK UP HIGHER IN BOND YIELDS.\nI TALKED TO HIM ABOUT THIS, TOO. I ASKED HIM WHETHER HE THOUGHT\nTHAT THIS WAS A BEGINNING OF SOMETHING MORE SUSTAINED A\nSTEEPENING OF CURVES, AN INCREASE IN YIELDS AS WE PUSH\nINTO 2017. AND WHAT IMPACT THAT WILL HAVE\nON BANK PRICES AND THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE MONEY.\nLISTEN IN. >> WELL, LOOK, IF WE LOOK BACK\nIN THE LAST 24 MONTHS, WE SAW A LOT OF THIS BACK AND FORTH ON\nMARKET EXPECTATIONS. EXACTLY A YEAR AGO WE WERE\nEXPECTING HIKES BY THE FED. ONE HAS TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT\nTRYING TO READ TOO MUCH INTO RHETORIC AND POLICIES.\nI THINK IT'S TRUE THAT THE MOMENTUM SEEMS TO BE THERE FOR\nAT LEAST ONE HIKE BY THE FED. BUT I WOULD BE VERY CAUTIOUS\nBEFORE CALLING OFF THE QUANTITATIVE EASING AND RELAXED\nMONETARY POLICY OF CENTRAL BANKS.\n>> IT'S KIND OF TIED WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN BANK SHARE PRICES.\nIF WE SEE STEEPER YIELD CURVES THEY CAN PERFORM BETTER.\nDO YOU THINK PEOPLE ARE GETTING A BIT TOO OPTIMISTIC?\n>> YES. WELL, OF COURSE, BUT IF YOU ARE\nMAINLY BASED -- YOU HAVE A U.S.-BASED BALANCE SHEET AND\nASSETS, AND LIABILITIES IN U.S. DOLLARS, I THINK YOU HAVE BEEN\nALREADY BENEFITING A LOT COMPARED TO EUROPEAN BANKS OR\nSWISS BANK OR JAPANESE BANK. SO IT'S A FACT THAT IT'S ALREADY\nONGOING. OF COURSE, IF THERE IS ANY\nCHANGE IN CENTRAL BANK POLICIES OR THE FED, THOSE WILL BENEFIT\nTHE MOST. >> WHAT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER WHEN\nWE TALK ABOUT UBS IS THAT THEY HAVE LESS EXPOSURE TO INVESTMENT\nBANKING, SHIFTED VERY MUCH AWAY FROM THAT INTO THE WEALTH\nMANAGEMENT BUSINESS. SO WHEN WE SEE OTHER BANKS,\nPARTICULARLY WALL STREET BANKS BENEFIT, UBS IS AT SOME KIND OF\nDISADVANTAGE. THEY ALSO CRAFTED THE BUSINESS\nTO BE MORE GEARED TOWARDS EUROPE AND ASIA.\nONCE AGAIN, THE REAL OUTPERFORMER IS THE STATES.\nWHEN YOU BEAR ALL THAT IN MIND, ACTUALLY AS THE CEO SAID THIS\nWAS A SOME LID QUARTER AND THEY'RE CONTINUING TO DO THE\nBUSINESS DESPITE THE CHALLENGES THAT REMAIN.\nTHEY'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT NOW FOR ABOUT 21 QUARTERS.\nI DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING ANYWHERE ANY TIME SOON AS FAR AS\nTHIS COMPANY IS CONCERNED. BACK TO YOU.\n>> JULIA, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. JULIA CHATTERLEY JOINING US LIVE\nOUT OF ZURICH.",

WE HAVE GIVEN A PRELIMINARY\nGUIDANCE ON 2017, WHICH IS INDICATING LOW SINGLE DIGIT\nGROWTH IN OUR TURNOVER, AND FLAT TO LOW SINGLE DIGIT GROWTH\nPERCENTAGE-WISE IN OPERATING PROFIT.\nTHAT'S REFLECTING AN APPROXIMATELY 5% NEGATIVE\nPRICING IMPACT IN THE ITSELF FRANCHISE.\nAND THAT'S HALF OF NOVO NORDISK. THAT'S A PRIME CONCERN OF THE\nINVESTORS. >> STEVEN ISAACS IS CHAIRMAN OF\nTHE INVESTMENT COMMITTEE AT ALVINE CAPITAL.\nHI. >> GOOD MORNING.\n>> GOOD MORNING. YOU HEARD ABOUT HOW PEOPLE ARE\nCONCERNED ABOUT THE OUTLOOK FOR 2017.\nYOU HAD THE UBS CEO SAYING IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO READ THE INTEREST\nRATE CYCLE AS WELL. >> MM-HMM.\nHAVE YOU SEEN ONE OF THESE? IT'S NOT FOR YOU --\n>> NOT FOR A LONG TIME. IT'S ONE OF THE NEW FIVE POUND\nNOTES. I'M SHOWING IT AS AN EXAMPLE OF\nHOW MONETARY DEBASEMENT HAS WORKED OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS.\nMONETARY POLICY IS A LAGGING INDICATOR.\nWE'VE NOW HAD CLOSE TO A DECADE OF ULTRA EASY POLICY.\nIN THE LAST TWO, THREE YEARS, NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES,\nQUANTITATIVE EASING, THE KITCHEN SINK THROWN AT IT.\nIT'S MY VIEW THAT FLOW IS COMING THROUGH INTO THE REAL ECONOMY.\nWE'RE SEEING A PICK UP IN INFLATION.\nA NUMBER OF INDICATORS, NOT JUST IN ONE COUNTRY.\nI THINK THE BOND MARKET IS THE CANARY IN THE COAL MINE.\nWE ARE MOVING TO A NEW PHASE. WE HAVE BEEN IN A BULL MARKET\nFOR BONDS FOR 35 YEARS, MY ENTIRE CAREER.\nIT'S A BIG BIG WAKE UP CALL FOR ALL OF US IN THE MARKETS.\nIF WE GO INTO A PROPER BEAR MARKET FOR BONDS, LET'S SAY\nTEN-YEAR GILTS COULD GO BACK TO 5%, THAT WILL MAKE A PROFOUND\nDIFFERENCE TO ALL SORTS OF EXPECTATION AND MARKETS THAT\nRELIED ON THIS EASY POLICY FOR A LONG TIME.\n>> DO YOU THINK WE COULD END UP IN A SCENARIO WHERE WE HAVE\nINFLATION RISING BUT INTEREST RATES DON'T RISE AT THE SAME WAY\nWE ANTICIPATE BECAUSE MARKETS ARE NOT READY FOR IT?\nDO WE STILL NEED THIS MONETARY EASING?\n>> CENTRAL BANKS WILL BE BEHIND THE CURVE.\nTHEY ARE ALWAYS IN THIS SITUATION.\nIT WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME. THE BOND MARKET IS LEADING THE\nWAY TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. CENTRAL BANKS, SWEDEN YESTERDAY\nFOR INSTANCE WAS TALKING ABOUT EASING.\nIN THE UK, MARK CARNEY'S PROPENSITY IS TO EASE.\nTHE CENTRAL BANKS ARE NOT EASING THIS PROCESS BUT THEY'RE ALSO\nEXHAUSTED. IN EUROPE, THE BEGINNING OF THE\nYEAR THERE WERE TALKS ABOUT INTEREST RATES BEING SLASHED\nFURTHER AND FURTHER INTO NEGATIVE TERRITORY, BUT DRAGHI\nHAS BEEN INDICATING THAT THE FIRE POWER DOESN'T WORK ANY\nLONGER. IF YOU DO CUT INTEREST RATES\nMORE, YOU UNDERMINE YOUR FINANCIAL SYSTEM AND CREATE\nOTHER PROBLEMS. THIS IS A NEOFISHERISM, THERE IS\nA POINT OF INTEREST RATES WHERE FURTHER DEBASEMENT DOES NOT HELP\nANYTHING. IT CERTAINLY SPURS INFLATION,\nBUT DOESN'T FEED THROUGH TO THE ECONOMY.\nTHE CENTRAL BANKS IN A WAY ARE THE NEXT PROBLEM, THAT'S TWO,\nTHREE YEARS FROM NOW. I THINK THE PROBLEM AT THE\nMOMENT IS INFLATION. >> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE BIG\nSHIFT THAT WE'VE SEEN IN BOND YIELDS?\nJUST LOOKING AT WHAT HAPPENED OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS, A SURGE\nIN BRITISH BOND YEARS, EUROZONE BOND YIELDS, TREASURY SAW A\nBOOST TO A FIVE-MONTH HIGH, NOW WELL ABOVE 1.8%.\n>> ONE OF THE OTHER CAUSES OF INCIPIENT INFLATION IS THE REALITY THAT GLOBALIZATION HAS\nREACHED A PEAK. IN ICELAND, THEY'RE ELECTING A\nPOLITICAL PARTY. THAT SHOWS THE NEW FORCES AT\nWORK, THE POPULOUS FORCES AT WORK ARE UPENDING THIS THOUGHT\nTHAT YOU CAN HAVE A SUPPLY CHAIN ACROSS THE GLOBE.\nTHAT'S WHY INFLATION IS SO POLLUTED.\nIN THE U.S., WE HAVE THE BIG ONE IN TEN DAYS.\n>> YOU THINK TRUMP IS GOING TO WINMENT.\n>> I THINK TRUMP IS GOING TO WIN.\n>> I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE MIGHT DISAGREE WITH THE MATHEMATICS OF\nTHE STATES, THEY HAVE TO WIN EACH STATE.\n>> WELL, I THINK THE FIRST THING IS TO ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT BARACK\nOBAMA. BARACK OBAMA WAS AN UNKNOWN\nSENATOR. A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE CONCERNED\nTHAT AS AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN HE MIGHT, IN FACT, NOT BE\nELECTABLE. BUT WHAT THEY MISSED WAS LIFE\nIMITATING ART. THERE WAS A SUCCESSFUL\nTELEVISION PROGRAM CALLED \"24\" AND IN THAT PROGRAM, WHICH 35\nMILLION AMERICANS WATCHED THERE WAS A TALL, GRAVELLY VOICED\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT MAKING ALL THE RIGHT DECISIONS.\nI THINK THAT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO\nSAY, HANG ON A MINUTE, THIS GUY CAN DO THE JOB.\nWITH TRUMP, WE'VE HAD \"THE APPRENTICE.\"\nWE'VE HAD TRUMP WHO BECAME A REALITY TV STAR.\nAGAIN, OVER 30 MILLION PEOPLE WATCHING IT.\nLITERALLY HIRING AND FIRING PEOPLE, ACTING IN COMPLETE\nCOMMAND AS A PRESIDENTIAL STAR CANDIDATE.\nTHAT'S ONE INTERESTING FACT. ON THE ACTUAL POLLS, I THINK\nPEOPLE UNDERSTAND AFTER THE BREXIT ELECTION HERE, THE\nCONSERVATIVE ELECTION IN MAY OF 2015, MIDTERM ELECTIONS IN THE\nU.S., ISRAELI ELECTIONS, IT'S BECOMING INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT\nTO ACCURATELY POLL. IT'S PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT TO\nGET TO PEOPLE WHO ARE PERHAPS CONSERVATIVE OR RIGHT OF CENTER\nWHO DON'T WANT TO GIVE OUT THEIR CHOICES TO A POLLSTER.\n>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

ANALYSTS WERE EXPECTING A NET\nPROFIT OF 945 MILLION FRANCS. JULIA JOINS US NOW.\nSHE'S IN ZURICH. WE'RE LOOKING AT A PROFIT DROP\nIN UBS' YEAR ON YEAR FIGURE,S A NOTING THE RESERVES ON PENALTIES\nLINKED TO THE MISSELLING OF RESIDENTIAL MBSs.\n>> ABSOLUTELY. GOOD MORNING.\nA LOT OF THINGS HERE. AS YOU LOOK ACROSS THE BOARD,\nVERSUS ANALYST EXPECTATIONS, TODAY THEY BEAT OR WERE IN LINE.\nI THINK UBS BELIEVES THIS IS A SOLID LEVEL OF RESULTS, NO\nMATTER WHERE YOU LOOK. WE HAVE THE DILUTED EPS,\nADJUSTED PROFITS BETTER THAN EXPECTED AND THE CHALLENGES THAT\nARE ONGOING FOR THIS BANK AND FOR ALL BANKS HERE IN\nPARTICULAR. AND UBS DON'T SEE THAT GOING\nAWAY ANY TIME SEEN. A BRIGHT SPOT HERE, GIVEN THE\nCHALLENGES OF NEGATIVE RATES, IS WHAT THEY'RE DOING DOMESTICALLY\nIN SWITZERLAND. IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR PERSONAL\nAND CORPORATE PART OF THE BUSINESS, THEY HAVE THE BEST\nQUARTER SINCE 2008. I THINK THIS IS A BRIGHT SPOT.\nOF COURSE THE DIVIDENDS. SOME CONCERNS OUT THERE FOR\nINVESTORS THAT PERHAPS THE DIVIDEND COULD SLIP.\nTHEY HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT 60 CENTS.\nWHEN I SPOKE TO THE CEO HE REITERATED WE'RE STILL ON TRACK\nWITH THAT. THAT'S GIVING INVESTORS COMFORT\nTODAY, TOO. AS YOU MENTIONED, A RISE IN\nPROVISIONS FOR LITIGATION OF 490 MILLION SWISS.\nTHIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE UBS HAS ALSO GOT OUTSTANDING U.S.\nMORTGAGE RELATED LITIGATION ISSUES.\nAND THIS IS WHAT I PICKED UP ON WITH THE CEO.\nI SAID TO WHAT EXTENT OF THOSE NEW PROVISIONS TO DO WITH\nMORTGAGE RELATED ISSUES. LISTEN IN.\n>> THE VAST MAJORITIES ARE NBS RELATED MATTERS.\nWE HAVE DIFFERENT EXPOSURES WE'VE BEEN WORKING THROUGH OVER\nTHE LAST DECADE NOW, AND STILL ONGOING.\nTHAT'S THE VAST MAJORITY OF PROVISIONS.\nARE YOU MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SITUATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF\nJUSTICE IN LIGHT WITH WHAT WE'VE SEEN WITH DEUTSCHE BANK IN THE\nLAST MONTH AND A HALF? >> LOOK, NOT REALLY, BECAUSE\nEVERY SITUATION ON THIS KIND OF MATTER IS DIFFERENT.\nBOTH FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT OF VIEW AND EVERY -- AND EVERY BANK\nMAY HAVE ITS OWN DIFFERENT SITUATION.\nSO, I'M NOT PARTICULARLY CONCERNED BECAUSE OF THAT.\n>> WHAT WE HEAR IS THAT OF ALL THE BANKS THAT ARE HAVING\nDISCUSSIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, YOU'RE KIND OF LOW\nDOWN THE PECKING ORDER. CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT?\n>> WELL, I LOOK -- I'M NOT LOOKING AT ANY KIND OF QUEUE.\nI ALWAYS FEEL THAT IT IS VERY -- IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE\nTIMING OF THE RESOLUTIONS OF THIS KIND OF MATTER.\nAS I SAY. THINGS ARE DIFFERENT BANK BY\nBANK. >> THE RISK IS IF IT GETS PUSHED\nBACK INTO NEXT YEAR, YOU'LL BE DEALING WITH A FRESH\nADMINISTRATION. DO YOU THINK THAT MAKES A\nDIFFERENCE? >> WELL, CALL ME NOSTALGIC, BUT\nI HOPE JUSTICE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH POLITICAL INFLUENCE.\n>> I THINK THE GENERAL BELIEF IS THAT THE LITIGATION ISSUES WILL\nREMAIN A BLACK CLOUD HANGING OVER THE EUROPEAN BANKING\nSECTOR. AND A DRAG ON SHARE PRICES.\nBUT SOMETHING THAT IS ALLOWED OR SEEING SOME ELEMENT OF A RALLY\nIN THE LAST FEW WEEKS HAS BEEN THE STEEPENING OF THE YIELD\nCURVE AND THE PICK UP HIGHER IN BOND YIELDS.\nI TALKED TO HIM ABOUT THIS, TOO. I ASKED HIM WHETHER HE THOUGHT\nTHAT THIS WAS A BEGINNING OF SOMETHING MORE SUSTAINED A\nSTEEPENING OF CURVES, AN INCREASE IN YIELDS AS WE PUSH\nINTO 2017. AND WHAT IMPACT THAT WILL HAVE\nON BANK PRICES AND THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE MONEY.\nLISTEN IN. >> WELL, LOOK, IF WE LOOK BACK\nIN THE LAST 24 MONTHS, WE SAW A LOT OF THIS BACK AND FORTH ON\nMARKET EXPECTATIONS. EXACTLY A YEAR AGO WE WERE\nEXPECTING HIKES BY THE FED. ONE HAS TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT\nTRYING TO READ TOO MUCH INTO RHETORIC AND POLICIES.\nI THINK IT'S TRUE THAT THE MOMENTUM SEEMS TO BE THERE FOR\nAT LEAST ONE HIKE BY THE FED. BUT I WOULD BE VERY CAUTIOUS\nBEFORE CALLING OFF THE QUANTITATIVE EASING AND RELAXED\nMONETARY POLICY OF CENTRAL BANKS.\n>> IT'S KIND OF TIED WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN BANK SHARE PRICES.\nIF WE SEE STEEPER YIELD CURVES THEY CAN PERFORM BETTER.\nDO YOU THINK PEOPLE ARE GETTING A BIT TOO OPTIMISTIC?\n>> YES. WELL, OF COURSE, BUT IF YOU ARE\nMAINLY BASED -- YOU HAVE A U.S.-BASED BALANCE SHEET AND\nASSETS, AND LIABILITIES IN U.S. DOLLARS, I THINK YOU HAVE BEEN\nALREADY BENEFITING A LOT COMPARED TO EUROPEAN BANKS OR\nSWISS BANK OR JAPANESE BANK. SO IT'S A FACT THAT IT'S ALREADY\nONGOING. OF COURSE, IF THERE IS ANY\nCHANGE IN CENTRAL BANK POLICIES OR THE FED, THOSE WILL BENEFIT\nTHE MOST. >> WHAT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER WHEN\nWE TALK ABOUT UBS IS THAT THEY HAVE LESS EXPOSURE TO INVESTMENT\nBANKING, SHIFTED VERY MUCH AWAY FROM THAT INTO THE WEALTH\nMANAGEMENT BUSINESS. SO WHEN WE SEE OTHER BANKS,\nPARTICULARLY WALL STREET BANKS BENEFIT, UBS IS AT SOME KIND OF\nDISADVANTAGE. THEY ALSO CRAFTED THE BUSINESS\nTO BE MORE GEARED TOWARDS EUROPE AND ASIA.\nONCE AGAIN, THE REAL OUTPERFORMER IS THE STATES.\nWHEN YOU BEAR ALL THAT IN MIND, ACTUALLY AS THE CEO SAID THIS\nWAS A SOME LID QUARTER AND THEY'RE CONTINUING TO DO THE\nBUSINESS DESPITE THE CHALLENGES THAT REMAIN.\nTHEY'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT NOW FOR ABOUT 21 QUARTERS.\nI DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING ANYWHERE ANY TIME SOON AS FAR AS\nTHIS COMPANY IS CONCERNED. BACK TO YOU.\n>> JULIA, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. JULIA CHATTERLEY JOINING US LIVE\nOUT OF ZURICH.",

WE HAVE GIVEN A PRELIMINARY\nGUIDANCE ON 2017, WHICH IS INDICATING LOW SINGLE DIGIT\nGROWTH IN OUR TURNOVER, AND FLAT TO LOW SINGLE DIGIT GROWTH\nPERCENTAGE-WISE IN OPERATING PROFIT.\nTHAT'S REFLECTING AN APPROXIMATELY 5% NEGATIVE\nPRICING IMPACT IN THE ITSELF FRANCHISE.\nAND THAT'S HALF OF NOVO NORDISK.

I'M SHOWING IT AS AN EXAMPLE OF\nHOW MONETARY DEBASEMENT HAS WORKED OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS.\nMONETARY POLICY IS A LAGGING INDICATOR.\nWE'VE NOW HAD CLOSE TO A DECADE OF ULTRA EASY POLICY.\nIN THE LAST TWO, THREE YEARS, NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES,\nQUANTITATIVE EASING, THE KITCHEN SINK THROWN AT IT.\nIT'S MY VIEW THAT FLOW IS COMING THROUGH INTO THE REAL ECONOMY.\nWE'RE SEEING A PICK UP IN INFLATION.\nA NUMBER OF INDICATORS, NOT JUST IN ONE COUNTRY.\nI THINK THE BOND MARKET IS THE CANARY IN THE COAL MINE.\nWE ARE MOVING TO A NEW PHASE. WE HAVE BEEN IN A BULL MARKET\nFOR BONDS FOR 35 YEARS, MY ENTIRE CAREER.\nIT'S A BIG BIG WAKE UP CALL FOR ALL OF US IN THE MARKETS.\nIF WE GO INTO A PROPER BEAR MARKET FOR BONDS, LET'S SAY\nTEN-YEAR GILTS COULD GO BACK TO 5%, THAT WILL MAKE A PROFOUND\nDIFFERENCE TO ALL SORTS OF EXPECTATION AND MARKETS THAT\nRELIED ON THIS EASY POLICY FOR A LONG TIME.\n>> DO YOU THINK WE COULD END UP IN A SCENARIO WHERE WE HAVE\nINFLATION RISING BUT INTEREST RATES DON'T RISE AT THE SAME WAY\nWE ANTICIPATE BECAUSE MARKETS ARE NOT READY FOR IT?\nDO WE STILL NEED THIS MONETARY EASING?\n>> CENTRAL BANKS WILL BE BEHIND THE CURVE.\nTHEY ARE ALWAYS IN THIS SITUATION.\nIT WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME. THE BOND MARKET IS LEADING THE\nWAY TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. CENTRAL BANKS, SWEDEN YESTERDAY\nFOR INSTANCE WAS TALKING ABOUT EASING.\nIN THE UK, MARK CARNEY'S PROPENSITY IS TO EASE.\nTHE CENTRAL BANKS ARE NOT EASING THIS PROCESS BUT THEY'RE ALSO\nEXHAUSTED. IN EUROPE, THE BEGINNING OF THE\nYEAR THERE WERE TALKS ABOUT INTEREST RATES BEING SLASHED\nFURTHER AND FURTHER INTO NEGATIVE TERRITORY, BUT DRAGHI\nHAS BEEN INDICATING THAT THE FIRE POWER DOESN'T WORK ANY\nLONGER. IF YOU DO CUT INTEREST RATES\nMORE, YOU UNDERMINE YOUR FINANCIAL SYSTEM AND CREATE\nOTHER PROBLEMS. THIS IS A NEOFISHERISM, THERE IS\nA POINT OF INTEREST RATES WHERE FURTHER DEBASEMENT DOES NOT HELP\nANYTHING. IT CERTAINLY SPURS INFLATION,\nBUT DOESN'T FEED THROUGH TO THE ECONOMY.\nTHE CENTRAL BANKS IN A WAY ARE THE NEXT PROBLEM, THAT'S TWO,\nTHREE YEARS FROM NOW. I THINK THE PROBLEM AT THE\nMOMENT IS INFLATION. >> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE BIG\nSHIFT THAT WE'VE SEEN IN BOND YIELDS?\nJUST LOOKING AT WHAT HAPPENED OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS, A SURGE\nIN BRITISH BOND YEARS, EUROZONE BOND YIELDS, TREASURY SAW A\nBOOST TO A FIVE-MONTH HIGH, NOW WELL ABOVE 1.8%.\n>> ONE OF THE OTHER CAUSES OF INCIPIENT INFLATION IS THE REALITY THAT GLOBALIZATION HAS\nREACHED A PEAK. IN ICELAND, THEY'RE ELECTING A\nPOLITICAL PARTY. THAT SHOWS THE NEW FORCES AT\nWORK, THE POPULOUS FORCES AT WORK ARE UPENDING THIS THOUGHT\nTHAT YOU CAN HAVE A SUPPLY CHAIN ACROSS THE GLOBE.\nTHAT'S WHY INFLATION IS SO POLLUTED.\nIN THE U.S., WE HAVE THE BIG ONE IN TEN DAYS.\n>> YOU THINK TRUMP IS GOING TO WINMENT.\n>> I THINK TRUMP IS GOING TO WIN.\n>> I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE MIGHT DISAGREE WITH THE MATHEMATICS OF\nTHE STATES, THEY HAVE TO WIN EACH STATE.\n>> WELL, I THINK THE FIRST THING IS TO ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT BARACK\nOBAMA. BARACK OBAMA WAS AN UNKNOWN\nSENATOR. A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE CONCERNED\nTHAT AS AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN HE MIGHT, IN FACT, NOT BE\nELECTABLE. BUT WHAT THEY MISSED WAS LIFE\nIMITATING ART. THERE WAS A SUCCESSFUL\nTELEVISION PROGRAM CALLED \"24\" AND IN THAT PROGRAM, WHICH 35\nMILLION AMERICANS WATCHED THERE WAS A TALL, GRAVELLY VOICED\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT MAKING ALL THE RIGHT DECISIONS.\nI THINK THAT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO\nSAY, HANG ON A MINUTE, THIS GUY CAN DO THE JOB.\nWITH TRUMP, WE'VE HAD \"THE APPRENTICE.\"\nWE'VE HAD TRUMP WHO BECAME A REALITY TV STAR.\nAGAIN, OVER 30 MILLION PEOPLE WATCHING IT.\nLITERALLY HIRING AND FIRING PEOPLE, ACTING IN COMPLETE\nCOMMAND AS A PRESIDENTIAL STAR CANDIDATE.\nTHAT'S ONE INTERESTING FACT. ON THE ACTUAL POLLS, I THINK\nPEOPLE UNDERSTAND AFTER THE BREXIT ELECTION HERE, THE\nCONSERVATIVE ELECTION IN MAY OF 2015, MIDTERM ELECTIONS IN THE\nU.S., ISRAELI ELECTIONS, IT'S BECOMING INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT\nTO ACCURATELY POLL. IT'S PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT TO\nGET TO PEOPLE WHO ARE PERHAPS CONSERVATIVE OR RIGHT OF CENTER\nWHO DON'T WANT TO GIVE OUT THEIR CHOICES TO A POLLSTER.\n>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

SO IT'S JUST AN IMPACT OF THAT\nSLIGHTLY WEAKER SUMMER MONTHS. WE SEE GOOD DEMAND, CONSUMERS\nARE HAVING MORE DISPOSABLE INCOME.\nHOUSING STARTS ARE CONTINUING TO IMPROVE.\nWE HAVE A GOOD UNDERLYING VIEW ON THE NORTH AMERICAN MARKET.\n>> WHAT'S HAPPENING IN EUROPE? YOU'RE SAYING NOW THAT YOU WILL\nCOME IN IN THE LOWER END OF YOUR GROWTH RANGE OF 2% TO 4%.\n>> THAT'S MAINLY DRIVEN BY THE WEAKER WHOLESALE DEMAND WE'RE\nSEEING IN THE UK, PLUS A BIT SLOWER GROWTH IN THE SOUTHERN\nPARTS OF EUROPE, SPAIN IN PARTICULAR.\nBUT NOT A MAJOR SHIFT OVERALL. MOST MARKETS CONTINUING TO GROW\nIN EUROPE. >> AND I LOOK AT LATIN AMERICA,\nBRAZIL, ARGENTINA. WE ARE LOOKING AT A PRETTY BIG\nDROP THERE. WHY THAT SHIFT?\n>> I THINK WE'RE CONTINUING TO SEE WEAK IN\nBRAZIL AND LATIN AMERICA. WE HAVE UNEMPLOYMENT INCREASING,\nWE SEE ALSO FISCAL OSTERITY. THAT'S CONTINUING TO DAMPEN\nCONSUMER DEMAND FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER, BUT THEN THE MARKETS\nHOPEFULLY STABILIZING WITH POLITICAL STABLE THERE.\n>> HAVING COVERED THE GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS THAT YOU'RE\nFOCUSED ON, I'M LOOKING AT WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH REGARDS TO\nRENEWABLES. YOU HAVE THIS 50% RENEWABLE\nENERGY TARGET FOR 2020. WHAT'S YOUR LEVEL TODAY?\nHOW MUCH PERCENT COMES FROM RENEWABLE?\n>> IN EUROPE WE'RE ALREADY QUITE HIGH, BUT IN OTHER MARKETS IT'S\nA LOWER NUMBER. SO THIS IS ABOUT GETTING THE\nGROUP AVERAGE UP TO WHERE WE ARE IN EUROPE.\nWE HAVE GOOD TRACTION TO GET TO THAT 50% NUMBER BY 2020.\n>> IT'S FOUR YEARS. SOME ARE SAYING IT'S AN\nAMBITIOUS GREEN TARGET TO REACH OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS.\nYOU THINK IT'S REALISTIC? >> WE DO THINK IT'S REALISTIC.\nWE KNOW WHAT TO DO, BY IT REQUIRES VERY SIGNIFICANT\nEXCITEMENT FROM OUR SIDE. VERY FEEL COMMITTED TO THAT, OUR\nOVERALL OBJECTIVE IS TO CUT THE TOTAL IMPACT ON GREENHOUSE GAS\nEMISSIONS FROM OUR ACTIVITY AND PRODUCTS BY 50% FROM 2005 TO\n2020. WE'RE ON TRACK TO REACH THAT\nOBJECTIVE. >> ARE CONSUMERS WILLING TO PAY\nMORE FOR GREEN? I DID SPEAK TO ONE OF YOUR\nEXECUTIVES AT AN EVENT A COUPLE MONTHS BACK IN BERLIN, WE WERE\nTALKING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU CAN PASS ON THIS GREEN DIRECTION\nTO CONSUMERS. >> I THINK, FIRST OF ALL, BEING\nPERCEIVED AS A LEADER IN SUSTAINABILITY, WHICH WE ARE,\nHAS A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF OUR BRANDS\nWHICH IS GENERALLY GOOD FOR US. SECONDLY, PEOPLE ARE GENERALLY\nWILLING TO PAY FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY.\nIF WE CAN REDUCE THOSE COSTS, PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PAY FOR\nTHAT. >> WANT TO COME BACK TO NORTH\nAMERICA, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE SEEING WEAKNESS NOW BUT YOU\nDON'T ANTICIPATE THAT WEAKNESS TO STAY BUT YOU ARE SCALING BACK\nFORECASTS. I LOOKED AT THE NORTHWESTERN\nWHITE GOODS MARKET, IT LOOKS LIKE IT HAS FALLEN OFF A CLIFF\nWHEN YOU TAKE THE QUARTER ON QUARTER COMPARISONS.\n>> WE'VE SEEN A COUPLE YEARS OF SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN NORTH\nAMERICA, OVER 8% FOR A FEW YEARS IN A ROW.\nOF COURSE WE'RE SEEING THAT SHIFT DOWN TO THE 3%, 4% RANGE.\nIT'S A NATURAL CHANGE IN THE GROWTH RATE.\nWE DID HAVE SOME WEAK SUMMER MONTHS, BUT AGAIN SEPTEMBER CAME\nBACK. FOR IT'S, THE IMPORTANT PART IS\nTHAT WE UNDERLINE DEMAND DRIVERS IMPORTANT FOR US, SUCH AS\nHOUSEHOLD DISPOSABLE INCOMES, UNEMPLOYMENT RATES, HOUSE EQUITY VALUES, HOUSING STARTS, ALL OF\nTHOSE ARE DEVELOPING IN A FAVORABLE WAY IN AMERICA.\n>> THE INTERNET OF THINGS, THIS INTERCONNECTIVE HOUSEHOLD THAT\nWE'RE HEADED HOUSEHOLD THAT WE'RE HEADED TOWARDS, WHERE OUR\nCOFFEE MACHINE KNOWS THAT WE NEED COFFEE, IT TALKS TO THE\nWASHING MACHINE, IT CAN ORDER WITHOUT US BEING THERE.\nHOW FAR ARE WE FROM BECOMING HAVING DEVICES SO SMART THAT\nTHEY KNOW WHAT WE WANT. >> MOST OF WHAT YOU SEE IS\nPOSSIBLE TO DO, BUT AT A COST THAT IS PROHIBITIVE FOR MOST\nCONSUMERS, AND ALSO THE HASSLE THAT CONSUMERS HAVE TO GO\nTHROUGH TO GET THOSE BENEFITS ARE STILL TOO HIGH.\nTHOSE ARE CHALLENGES THAT WE WILL OVERCOME OVER THE COMING\nYEARS. I THINK THE FUTURE IS VERY MUCH\nDRIVEN BY MAKING CONSUMERS EXPERIENCES EASIER.\nIF YOU CAN TAKE CARE OF YOUR LAUNDRY WITH LESS HASSLE AND\nBETTER RESULTS, IF YOU CAN TAKE CARE OF YOUR COOKING CAN LESS\nHASSLE AND WITH BETTER RESULTS, THOSE ARE THINGS CONSUMERS WANT.\nOUR JOB IS TO PROVIDE THAT WITH THE LEAST -- LOWEST PRICE AND\nWITHOUT HASSLE.

ANALYSTS WERE EXPECTING A NET\nPROFIT OF 945 MILLION FRANCS. JULIA JOINS US NOW.\nSHE'S IN ZURICH. WE'RE LOOKING AT A PROFIT DROP\nIN UBS' YEAR ON YEAR FIGURE,S A NOTING THE RESERVES ON PENALTIES\nLINKED TO THE MISSELLING OF RESIDENTIAL MBSs.\n>> ABSOLUTELY. GOOD MORNING.\nA LOT OF THINGS HERE. AS YOU LOOK ACROSS THE BOARD,\nVERSUS ANALYST EXPECTATIONS, TODAY THEY BEAT OR WERE IN LINE.\nI THINK UBS BELIEVES THIS IS A SOLID LEVEL OF RESULTS, NO\nMATTER WHERE YOU LOOK. WE HAVE THE DILUTED EPS,\nADJUSTED PROFITS BETTER THAN EXPECTED AND THE CHALLENGES THAT\nARE ONGOING FOR THIS BANK AND FOR ALL BANKS HERE IN\nPARTICULAR. AND UBS DON'T SEE THAT GOING\nAWAY ANY TIME SEEN. A BRIGHT SPOT HERE, GIVEN THE\nCHALLENGES OF NEGATIVE RATES, IS WHAT THEY'RE DOING DOMESTICALLY\nIN SWITZERLAND. IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR PERSONAL\nAND CORPORATE PART OF THE BUSINESS, THEY HAVE THE BEST\nQUARTER SINCE 2008. I THINK THIS IS A BRIGHT SPOT.\nOF COURSE THE DIVIDENDS. SOME CONCERNS OUT THERE FOR\nINVESTORS THAT PERHAPS THE DIVIDEND COULD SLIP.\nTHEY HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT 60 CENTS.\nWHEN I SPOKE TO THE CEO HE REITERATED WE'RE STILL ON TRACK\nWITH THAT. THAT'S GIVING INVESTORS COMFORT\nTODAY, TOO. AS YOU MENTIONED, A RISE IN\nPROVISIONS FOR LITIGATION OF 490 MILLION SWISS.\nTHIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE UBS HAS ALSO GOT OUTSTANDING U.S.\nMORTGAGE RELATED LITIGATION ISSUES.\nAND THIS IS WHAT I PICKED UP ON WITH THE CEO.\nI SAID TO WHAT EXTENT OF THOSE NEW PROVISIONS TO DO WITH\nMORTGAGE RELATED ISSUES. LISTEN IN.\n>> THE VAST MAJORITIES ARE NBS RELATED MATTERS.\nWE HAVE DIFFERENT EXPOSURES WE'VE BEEN WORKING THROUGH OVER\nTHE LAST DECADE NOW, AND STILL ONGOING.\nTHAT'S THE VAST MAJORITY OF PROVISIONS.\nARE YOU MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SITUATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF\nJUSTICE IN LIGHT WITH WHAT WE'VE SEEN WITH DEUTSCHE BANK IN THE\nLAST MONTH AND A HALF? >> LOOK, NOT REALLY, BECAUSE\nEVERY SITUATION ON THIS KIND OF MATTER IS DIFFERENT.\nBOTH FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT OF VIEW AND EVERY -- AND EVERY BANK\nMAY HAVE ITS OWN DIFFERENT SITUATION.\nSO, I'M NOT PARTICULARLY CONCERNED BECAUSE OF THAT.\n>> WHAT WE HEAR IS THAT OF ALL THE BANKS THAT ARE HAVING\nDISCUSSIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, YOU'RE KIND OF LOW\nDOWN THE PECKING ORDER. CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT?\n>> WELL, I LOOK -- I'M NOT LOOKING AT ANY KIND OF QUEUE.\nI ALWAYS FEEL THAT IT IS VERY -- IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE\nTIMING OF THE RESOLUTIONS OF THIS KIND OF MATTER.\nAS I SAY. THINGS ARE DIFFERENT BANK BY\nBANK. >> THE RISK IS IF IT GETS PUSHED\nBACK INTO NEXT YEAR, YOU'LL BE DEALING WITH A FRESH\nADMINISTRATION. DO YOU THINK THAT MAKES A\nDIFFERENCE? >> WELL, CALL ME NOSTALGIC, BUT\nI HOPE JUSTICE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH POLITICAL INFLUENCE.\n>> I THINK THE GENERAL BELIEF IS THAT THE LITIGATION ISSUES WILL\nREMAIN A BLACK CLOUD HANGING OVER THE EUROPEAN BANKING\nSECTOR. AND A DRAG ON SHARE PRICES.\nBUT SOMETHING THAT IS ALLOWED OR SEEING SOME ELEMENT OF A RALLY\nIN THE LAST FEW WEEKS HAS BEEN THE STEEPENING OF THE YIELD\nCURVE AND THE PICK UP HIGHER IN BOND YIELDS.\nI TALKED TO HIM ABOUT THIS, TOO. I ASKED HIM WHETHER HE THOUGHT\nTHAT THIS WAS A BEGINNING OF SOMETHING MORE SUSTAINED A\nSTEEPENING OF CURVES, AN INCREASE IN YIELDS AS WE PUSH\nINTO 2017. AND WHAT IMPACT THAT WILL HAVE\nON BANK PRICES AND THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE MONEY.\nLISTEN IN. >> WELL, LOOK, IF WE LOOK BACK\nIN THE LAST 24 MONTHS, WE SAW A LOT OF THIS BACK AND FORTH ON\nMARKET EXPECTATIONS. EXACTLY A YEAR AGO WE WERE\nEXPECTING HIKES BY THE FED. ONE HAS TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT\nTRYING TO READ TOO MUCH INTO RHETORIC AND POLICIES.\nI THINK IT'S TRUE THAT THE MOMENTUM SEEMS TO BE THERE FOR\nAT LEAST ONE HIKE BY THE FED. BUT I WOULD BE VERY CAUTIOUS\nBEFORE CALLING OFF THE QUANTITATIVE EASING AND RELAXED\nMONETARY POLICY OF CENTRAL BANKS.\n>> IT'S KIND OF TIED WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN BANK SHARE PRICES.\nIF WE SEE STEEPER YIELD CURVES THEY CAN PERFORM BETTER.\nDO YOU THINK PEOPLE ARE GETTING A BIT TOO OPTIMISTIC?\n>> YES. WELL, OF COURSE, BUT IF YOU ARE\nMAINLY BASED -- YOU HAVE A U.S.-BASED BALANCE SHEET AND\nASSETS, AND LIABILITIES IN U.S. DOLLARS, I THINK YOU HAVE BEEN\nALREADY BENEFITING A LOT COMPARED TO EUROPEAN BANKS OR\nSWISS BANK OR JAPANESE BANK. SO IT'S A FACT THAT IT'S ALREADY\nONGOING. OF COURSE, IF THERE IS ANY\nCHANGE IN CENTRAL BANK POLICIES OR THE FED, THOSE WILL BENEFIT\nTHE MOST. >> WHAT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER WHEN\nWE TALK ABOUT UBS IS THAT THEY HAVE LESS EXPOSURE TO INVESTMENT\nBANKING, SHIFTED VERY MUCH AWAY FROM THAT INTO THE WEALTH\nMANAGEMENT BUSINESS. SO WHEN WE SEE OTHER BANKS,\nPARTICULARLY WALL STREET BANKS BENEFIT, UBS IS AT SOME KIND OF\nDISADVANTAGE. THEY ALSO CRAFTED THE BUSINESS\nTO BE MORE GEARED TOWARDS EUROPE AND ASIA.\nONCE AGAIN, THE REAL OUTPERFORMER IS THE STATES.\nWHEN YOU BEAR ALL THAT IN MIND, ACTUALLY AS THE CEO SAID THIS\nWAS A SOME LID QUARTER AND THEY'RE CONTINUING TO DO THE\nBUSINESS DESPITE THE CHALLENGES THAT REMAIN.\nTHEY'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT NOW FOR ABOUT 21 QUARTERS.\nI DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING ANYWHERE ANY TIME SOON AS FAR AS\nTHIS COMPANY IS CONCERNED. BACK TO YOU.\n>> JULIA, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. JULIA CHATTERLEY JOINING US LIVE\nOUT OF ZURICH.",

WE HAVE GIVEN A PRELIMINARY\nGUIDANCE ON 2017, WHICH IS INDICATING LOW SINGLE DIGIT\nGROWTH IN OUR TURNOVER, AND FLAT TO LOW SINGLE DIGIT GROWTH\nPERCENTAGE-WISE IN OPERATING PROFIT.\nTHAT'S REFLECTING AN APPROXIMATELY 5% NEGATIVE\nPRICING IMPACT IN THE ITSELF FRANCHISE.\nAND THAT'S HALF OF NOVO NORDISK.

IT'S NOT FOR YOU --\n>> NOT FOR A LONG TIME. IT'S ONE OF THE NEW FIVE POUND\nNOTES. I'M SHOWING IT AS AN EXAMPLE OF\nHOW MONETARY DEBASEMENT HAS WORKED OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS.\nMONETARY POLICY IS A LAGGING INDICATOR.\nWE'VE NOW HAD CLOSE TO A DECADE OF ULTRA EASY POLICY.\nIN THE LAST TWO, THREE YEARS, NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES,\nQUANTITATIVE EASING, THE KITCHEN SINK THROWN AT IT.\nIT'S MY VIEW THAT FLOW IS COMING THROUGH INTO THE REAL ECONOMY.\nWE'RE SEEING A PICK UP IN INFLATION.\nA NUMBER OF INDICATORS, NOT JUST IN ONE COUNTRY.\nI THINK THE BOND MARKET IS THE CANARY IN THE COAL MINE.\nWE ARE MOVING TO A NEW PHASE. WE HAVE BEEN IN A BULL MARKET\nFOR BONDS FOR 35 YEARS, MY ENTIRE CAREER.\nIT'S A BIG BIG WAKE UP CALL FOR ALL OF US IN THE MARKETS.\nIF WE GO INTO A PROPER BEAR MARKET FOR BONDS, LET'S SAY\nTEN-YEAR GILTS COULD GO BACK TO 5%, THAT WILL MAKE A PROFOUND\nDIFFERENCE TO ALL SORTS OF EXPECTATION AND MARKETS THAT\nRELIED ON THIS EASY POLICY FOR A LONG TIME.\n>> DO YOU THINK WE COULD END UP IN A SCENARIO WHERE WE HAVE\nINFLATION RISING BUT INTEREST RATES DON'T RISE AT THE SAME WAY\nWE ANTICIPATE BECAUSE MARKETS ARE NOT READY FOR IT?\nDO WE STILL NEED THIS MONETARY EASING?\n>> CENTRAL BANKS WILL BE BEHIND THE CURVE.\nTHEY ARE ALWAYS IN THIS SITUATION.\nIT WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME. THE BOND MARKET IS LEADING THE\nWAY TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. CENTRAL BANKS, SWEDEN YESTERDAY\nFOR INSTANCE WAS TALKING ABOUT EASING.\nIN THE UK, MARK CARNEY'S PROPENSITY IS TO EASE.\nTHE CENTRAL BANKS ARE NOT EASING THIS PROCESS BUT THEY'RE ALSO\nEXHAUSTED. IN EUROPE, THE BEGINNING OF THE\nYEAR THERE WERE TALKS ABOUT INTEREST RATES BEING SLASHED\nFURTHER AND FURTHER INTO NEGATIVE TERRITORY, BUT DRAGHI\nHAS BEEN INDICATING THAT THE FIRE POWER DOESN'T WORK ANY\nLONGER. IF YOU DO CUT INTEREST RATES\nMORE, YOU UNDERMINE YOUR FINANCIAL SYSTEM AND CREATE\nOTHER PROBLEMS. THIS IS A NEOFISHERISM, THERE IS\nA POINT OF INTEREST RATES WHERE FURTHER DEBASEMENT DOES NOT HELP\nANYTHING. IT CERTAINLY SPURS INFLATION,\nBUT DOESN'T FEED THROUGH TO THE ECONOMY.\nTHE CENTRAL BANKS IN A WAY ARE THE NEXT PROBLEM, THAT'S TWO,\nTHREE YEARS FROM NOW. I THINK THE PROBLEM AT THE\nMOMENT IS INFLATION. >> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE BIG\nSHIFT THAT WE'VE SEEN IN BOND YIELDS?\nJUST LOOKING AT WHAT HAPPENED OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS, A SURGE\nIN BRITISH BOND YEARS, EUROZONE BOND YIELDS, TREASURY SAW A\nBOOST TO A FIVE-MONTH HIGH, NOW WELL ABOVE 1.8%.\n>> ONE OF THE OTHER CAUSES OF INCIPIENT INFLATION IS THE REALITY THAT GLOBALIZATION HAS\nREACHED A PEAK. IN ICELAND, THEY'RE ELECTING A\nPOLITICAL PARTY. THAT SHOWS THE NEW FORCES AT\nWORK, THE POPULOUS FORCES AT WORK ARE UPENDING THIS THOUGHT\nTHAT YOU CAN HAVE A SUPPLY CHAIN ACROSS THE GLOBE.\nTHAT'S WHY INFLATION IS SO POLLUTED.\nIN THE U.S., WE HAVE THE BIG ONE IN TEN DAYS.\n>> YOU THINK TRUMP IS GOING TO WINMENT.\n>> I THINK TRUMP IS GOING TO WIN.\n>> I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE MIGHT DISAGREE WITH THE MATHEMATICS OF\nTHE STATES, THEY HAVE TO WIN EACH STATE.\n>> WELL, I THINK THE FIRST THING IS TO ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT BARACK\nOBAMA. BARACK OBAMA WAS AN UNKNOWN\nSENATOR. A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE CONCERNED\nTHAT AS AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN HE MIGHT, IN FACT, NOT BE\nELECTABLE. BUT WHAT THEY MISSED WAS LIFE\nIMITATING ART. THERE WAS A SUCCESSFUL\nTELEVISION PROGRAM CALLED \"24\" AND IN THAT PROGRAM, WHICH 35\nMILLION AMERICANS WATCHED THERE WAS A TALL, GRAVELLY VOICED\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT MAKING ALL THE RIGHT DECISIONS.\nI THINK THAT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO\nSAY, HANG ON A MINUTE, THIS GUY CAN DO THE JOB.\nWITH TRUMP, WE'VE HAD \"THE APPRENTICE.\"\nWE'VE HAD TRUMP WHO BECAME A REALITY TV STAR.\nAGAIN, OVER 30 MILLION PEOPLE WATCHING IT.\nLITERALLY HIRING AND FIRING PEOPLE, ACTING IN COMPLETE\nCOMMAND AS A PRESIDENTIAL STAR CANDIDATE.\nTHAT'S ONE INTERESTING FACT. ON THE ACTUAL POLLS, I THINK\nPEOPLE UNDERSTAND AFTER THE BREXIT ELECTION HERE, THE\nCONSERVATIVE ELECTION IN MAY OF 2015, MIDTERM ELECTIONS IN THE\nU.S., ISRAELI ELECTIONS, IT'S BECOMING INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT\nTO ACCURATELY POLL. IT'S PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT TO\nGET TO PEOPLE WHO ARE PERHAPS CONSERVATIVE OR RIGHT OF CENTER\nWHO DON'T WANT TO GIVE OUT THEIR CHOICES TO A POLLSTER.\n>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

WE STILL ARE THE RISK FOR A\nCOUPLE OF SPOT SHOWERS AND\nBREEZY CONDITIONS STAY WITH US. NOT NECESSARILY DAMAGING WINDS\nBUT WINDBLOWN FRIDAY HERE.\nHEAVIEST STUFF MOVING OFFSHORE. ALSO MOVING INTO PARTS OF\nCENTRAL AND NORTHERN NEW\nENGLAND.

WELL, TONIGHT WE'VE GOT NEW\nLATE-BREAKING NEWS THAT THE DEMOCRATS MIGHT BE RECONSIDERING\nTHAT DECISION. THE DEMOCRATS MAY BE JUMPING\nBACK INTO THAT FLORIDA SENATE RACE AGAINST MARCO RUBIO AS OF\nTONIGHT. IT'S VERY LAST MINUTE.\nIT APPEARS TO BE THEM JUMPING BACK IN IN A VERY BIG WAY.\nIT'S INTERESTING, WE'VE GOT DETAILS ON THAT AHEAD.\nWE'VE ALSO GOT TREMENDOUSLY GOOD NAMES TONIGHT CONCERNING THE\nOBAMA FAMILY. IT'S NEWS THAT IS SLIGHTLY MORE\nPERSONAL THAN IT IS POLITICAL, BUT THAT'S AHEAD TONIGHT AS\nWELL. SO THERE'S LOTS -- LOTS COMING\nUP, INCLUDING FOR ONCE SOME NEWS THAT IS MORE GOOD THAN BAD,\nWHICH IS ALWAYS NICE. BUT WE'RE GOING TO START TONIGHT\nWITH SOME NEW TAPE THAT HAS NEVER BEEN HEARD PUBLICLY\nBEFORE. IT'S NEVER BEEN BROADCAST\nBEFORE. WE'RE GOING TO BREAK THIS HERE\nLIVE TONIGHT WITH YOU. AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU, YOU'LL\nBE SURPRISED TO HEAR THIS, BUT THIS NEW TAPE THAT HAS NEVER\nBEEN BROADCAST BEFORE, IT IS TAPE FROM THE GREATEST BASEBALL\nPLAYER IN NEW YORK. >> I WAS THE BEST BASEBALL\nPLAYER IN NEW YORK WHEN I WAS YOUNG.\n>> DO YOU RECOGNIZE THAT VOICE? THAT'S A REMARKABLE THING TO\nHAVE LEARNED TODAY FROM THIS BRAND NEW TAPE THAT'S NEVER BEEN\nBROADCAST BEFORE. IT'S DONALD TRUMP SPEAKING.\nHE SAYS WHEN I WAS YOUNG, SO WE'RE THINKING WE'RE TALKING\nABOUT MAYBE HE WAS 17 OR 16 YEARS OLD, WHEN HE WAS 16 YEARS\nOLD, THAT WAS 1962. THAT'S WHEN THE YANKEES WENT TO\nTHE WORLD SERIES, THEY WON THE WORLD SERIES.\nIT WAS LIKE MICKEY MANTLE, ROGER MARIS.\nEVEN IF YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT BASEBALL, YOU KNOW MICKEY\nMANTLE. BUT IT TURNS OUT NONE OF THEM\nWERE THE BEST BASEBALL PLAYER IN NEW YORK THAT YEAR.\nNO, IT WAS THIS OTHER GUY. >> I WAS THE BEST BASEBALL\nPLAYER IN NEW YORK WHEN I WAS YOUNG.\n>> THIS IS THE BEST TAPE WE'VE GOTTEN OUR HANDS ON IN A VERY\nLONG TIME. THIS IS INCREDIBLE.\nALL RIGHT. THIS IS FROM 2014.\nTHERE IS A PULITZER PRIZE-WINNING REPORTER NAMED\nMICHAEL DANTONIO. IN PREPARING THE BOOK HE DID\nHOURS AND HOURS OF INTERVIEWS WITH DONALD TRUMP, JUST RAW\nFOOTAGE OF THEM TALKING. SOME OF THOSE TAPES HAVE BEEN\nOBTAINED BY \"THE NEW YORK TIMES.\"\nTHE \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" HAS BEEN DOING A LITTLE BIT OF\nREPORTING ON THEM RECENTLY BUT THEY HAVE NOT PUBLISHED THIS\nAUDIO WE ARE ABOUT TO PLAY. I DON'T TOTALLY WANT TO SPOIL IT\nHERE, BUT ARM CHAIR PSYCHOLOGISTS, START YOUR\nENGINES. THIS IS INCREDIBLE.\n>> I WENT TO MILITARY ACADEMY, NEW YORK MILITARY ACADEMY FOR\nFIVE YEARS, FROM THE YEAR BEFORE FRESHMAN.\n>> SO EIGHTH GRADE ON? >> YES.\n>> WHOSE IDEA WAS THIS? >> WELL, I WAS VERY REBELLIOUS\nAND MY PARENTS THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA.\nI WAS VERY REBELLIOUS. I LOVED TO FIGHT.\nI ALWAYS LOVE TO FIGHT. >> PHYSICAL FIGHTS.\n>> ALL KINDS OF FIGHTS. PHYSICAL.\n>> ARGUMENTS? >> ALL TYPES OF FIGHTS.\nANY KIND OF FIGHT I LOVED IT, INCLUDING PHYSICAL.\nAND I WAS ALWAYS THE BEST ATHLETE, SOMETHING THAT NOBODY\nKNEW ABOUT ME. BUT ONE GUY YOU SHOULD SPEAK TO\nBEFORE IT'S TOO LATE, BECAUSE HE'S A PRETTY OLD GUY NOW, IS\nMAJOR DOBIAS. SO WHEN DOBIAS WAS A DRILL\nSERGEANT IN THE ARMY, AND THESE GUYS WERE ROUGH.\nTHIS GUY WAS SO ROUGH. IN THOSE DAYS, THEY'D SMACK THE\nHELL OUT OF YOU. IT'S NOT LIKE TODAY WHERE YOU\nSMACK SOMEBODY AND YOU END UP GOING TO JAIL FOR THE REST OF\nYOUR LIFE. SO I WENT UP THERE, I'LL NEVER\nFORGET. >> EIGHTH GRADE?\n>> AND I'M STANDING THERE AT MILITARY ACADEMY.\nTHIS GUY COMES UP AND HE'S LIKE A BULLDOG TOO, ROUGH GUY.\nHE WAS A DRILL SERGEANT. NOW THEY CALL HIM MAJOR DOBIAS.\nBUT WHEN I FIRST KNEW HIM HE WAS SERGEANT DOBISA RIGHT RIGHT\nARMY. HE WAS PHYSICALLY ROUGH AND\nMENTALLY ROUGH. HE WAS ALSO MY BASEBALL COACH.\nAND HE SAID THINGS LIKE STAND UP, AND I WENT GIVE ME A\n[ BLEEP ] BREAK. AND THIS GUY CAME AT ME.\nYOU WOULD NEVER BELIEVE IT. IT WAS REALLY FANTASTIC.\n>> DID HE ROUGH YOU UP? >> OH, YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.\n>> GRABBED YOU BY THE SHIRT? >> WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER, BUT\nIT WAS NOT LIKE WHAT HAPPENS TODAY.\nAND YOU HAD TO LEARN TO SURVIVE. IT WAS TOUGH.\nIT WASN'T TODAY. THOSE WERE ROUGHER TIMES.\nTHAT WAS BEFORE VIETNAM AND THESE WERE GUYS THAT DIDN'T TAKE\n[ BLEEP ]. YOU MUST CALL HIM, BEFORE IT'S\nTOO LATE. ASK HIM ABOUT HOW WAS TRUMP AS\nAN ATHLETE? BECAUSE HE SAID -- HE COACHED\nFOR MANY, MANY -- IT WAS LIKE 35 YEARS.\nHE SAID DONALD TRUMP WAS THE BEST ATHLETE I'VE EVER COACHED.\nDONALD TRUMP WAS THE BEST BASEBALL PLAYER I'VE EVER\nCOACHED. YOU KNOW, JUST SOMETHING TO --\n>> WHEN DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE GOOD?\n>> I ALWAYS KNEW I WAS GOOD. I WAS ALWAYS A GOOD ATHLETE.\nI WAS ALWAYS THE BEST ATHLETE. >> LIKE IN FIRST GRADE IF THE\nKIDS THE A GAME -- >> FROM BEFORE THE FIRST GRADE.\nI WAS THE BEST BASEBALL PLAYER IN NEW YORK WHEN I WAS YOUNG.\nNOW, IN THOSE DAYS, YOU KNOW, YOU COULDN'T PLAY BASEBALL\nBECAUSE THERE WAS NO REAL -- YOU KNOW, IT WASN'T A THING.\nPLUS MY FATHER WAS IN THE REAL ESTATE BUSINESS, WHICH I DIDN'T\nWANT TO GO INTO. I WANTED TO GO INTO THEATER.\nI WANTED TO GO INTO SPORTS. BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT WAS VERY\nLIMITED BECAUSE IN THOSE DAYS YOU COULDN'T EVEN MAKE ANY MONEY\nBEING A GREAT BASEBALL PLAYER. >> DIDN'T THE DODGERS TRAIN AT\nWEST POINT A COUPLE TIMES, IN THE SPRING?\n>> EVERYBODY WANTED ME TO BE A BASEBALL PLAYER.\n>> RIGHT. >> BUT I WAS A GOOD AT OTHER\nTHINGS TOO. I WAS GOOD AT WRESTLING.\nI WAS REALLY GOOD AT FOOTBALL. I WAS A GOOD -- I WAS ALWAYS\nGOOD AT SPORTS. I WAS ALWAYS LIKE THE BEST AT\nSPORTS. >> ALWAYS THE BEST.\nAT ALL SPORTS. MY FAVORITE PART OF THAT, I LOVE\nTHE EXPLANATION FOR WHY, YOU KNOW, NOBODY KNOWS EVEN NOW THAT\nHE WAS THE GREATEST BASEBALL PLAYER IN NEW YORK.\nHE SAYS WHEN I WAS YOUNG, I WAS THE BEST BASEBALL PLAYER IN NEW\nYORK WHEN I WAS YOUNG. NOW HE SAYS BUT, YOU KNOW, IN\nTHOSE DAYS, BASEBALL WASN'T REALLY A THING.\nI WAS THE BEST BASEBALL PLAYER IN NEW YORK WHEN I WAS YOUNG.\nNOW IN THOSE DAYS YOU COULDN'T PLAY BASEBALL BECAUSE THERE WAS\nNO REAL, YOU KNOW, IT WASN'T A THING.\nHE SAYS IN THOSE DAYS YOU COULDN'T EVEN MAKE ANY MONEY\nBEING A BASEBALL PLAYER. AGAIN, THE TIME HE'S TALKING\nABOUT HERE IS WHEN HE WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL, LIKE 1962, 1963.\nYANKEES GOING TO THE WORLD SERIES.\nSOME OF THE BEST REMEMBERED GAMES OF ALL TIME.\nBASEBALL, UNEQUIVOCALLY THE NATIONAL PASTIME.\nMICKEY MANTLE A NATIONAL HERO. BUT DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T WANT TO\nBOTHER SHOWING UP ALL OF THOSE LESSER BASEBALL PLAYERS BECAUSE\nBASEBALL WASN'T REALLY A THING THEN.\nWE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE LEATHER COVERED BALLS, WE JUST HAD ROCKS\nTHAT WE HID INTO THE CAVE ART. BASEBALL WASN'T A THING THEN?\nTHAT'S WHY YOU WEREN'T? EVERYBODY WANTED HIM TO PLAY BUT\nTHERE WASN'T REALLY A BASEBALL ORGANIZATION.\nDONALD TRUMP BELIEVES, NOT HYPERBOLICALLY, NOT JOKINGLY,\nBUT APPARENTLY IN ALL SERIOUSNESS THAT HE WAS THE\nGREATEST BASEBALL PLAYER IN NEW YORK WHEN HE WAS A YOUNG MAN.\nHE WAS THE BEST AT THAT. HE WAS THE BEST AT ALL OF\nSPORTS. AND WHY, MR. TRUMP, WERE YOU THE\nBEST? >> I THINK YOU HAVE A NATURAL\nABILITY AT THINGS. I'M A BIG BELIEVER IN --\n>> NATURE. >> NO, NOT NATURE.\nI'M A BIG BELIEVER IN NATURAL ABILITY.\nI BELIEVE IN BEING PREPARED AND ALL THAT STUFF.\nBUT IN MANY RESPECTS, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS AN INNATE\nABILITY. >> AND YOU KNEW THIS AS A KID?\n>> NO, I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT AS A KID.\n>> DO YOU THINK YOU HAD IT EVEN THEN?\n>> ALWAYS. >> WHEN YOU LOOK BACK AT\nYOURSELF -- >> I HAD IT.\nI ALWAYS HAD IT. >> I ALWAYS HAD IT.\nI NEVER HAD TO WORK. OTHER PEOPLE HAVE TO PREPARE AND\nDO STUFF, BUT I JUST CAME DOWN FROM HEAVEN, FOR EXAMPLE, AS THE\nGREATEST BASEBALL PLAYER IN NEW YORK.\n>> WERE YOU A GOOD HITTER? >> THE BEST.\n>> I WAS THE BEST HITTER. IT GIVES YOU SOME INSIGHT,\nRIGHT? I MEAN IF THAT IS HOW THIS\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE THINKS OF HIMSELF AND HAS ALWAYS THOUGHT\nOF HIMSELF GOING BACK TO FIRST GRADE -- NO, NO, NO, BEFORE\nFIRST GRADE, I MEAN IF YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THAT IS HOW HE\nTHINKS OF HIMSELF, THEN IT IS NOT A SURPRISE WHEN HE, LIKE,\nFOR EXAMPLE, TODAY ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL TELLS A CROWD OF\nSUPPORTERS IN OHIO THAT BASICALLY HE IS SICK OF THIS\nELECTION. HE IS SICK OF ALL THIS WORKING\nTO EARN THIS PRESIDENCY THING. HE'S SICK OF IT.\nJUST GIVE IT TO ME ALREADY. >> WHAT A DIFFERENCE.\nYOU KNOW, WHAT A DIFFERENCE THIS IS.\nAND JUST THINKING TO MYSELF RIGHT NOW, WE SHOULD JUST CANCEL\nTHE ELECTION AND JUST GIVE IT TO TRUMP, RIGHT?\nWHY ARE WE HAVING IT FOR? >> JUST GIVE IT TO TRUMP.\nWHAT ARE WE HAVING IT FOR? WHAT ARE YOU HAVING THIS\nELECTION FOR? I KNOW.\nIF YOU THINK OF YOURSELF AS A PERSON WHO HAS NEVER ACTUALLY\nHAD TO WORK FOR ANYTHING BECAUSE YOU WERE BORN INNATELY GREAT,\nYOU WERE BORNIN ATELY AS THE GREAT IS ATHLETE, IF YOU WERE\nEXCELLENT AT EVERYTHING YOU EVER TRIED BECAUSE YOU WERE BORN\nBASICALLY PERFECT, THEN WHY SHOULD YOU HAVE TO COMPETE FOR\nSOMETHING. I DESERVE IT BY VIRTUE OF ME\nBEING ME. SO IT OFFERS AN INSIGHT.\nTHIS TAPE FROM THE TRUMP BIOGRAPHER WHICH PROVIDED IT TO\n\"THE NEW YORK TIMES,\" I THINK THIS IS NEWSWORTHY TAPE, AND I\nTHINK IT IS HELPFUL TO UNDERSTANDING HOW DONALD TRUMP\nIS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT NOW, BECAUSE HE ON TAPE HERE TALKS IN\nTHIS VERY UNGUARDED WAY ABOUT HOW HE SEES HIMSELF AND THAT IS\nA RARE THING WE DON'T EVER GET FROM ANY CANDIDATE, LET ALONE\nFROM HIM. BUT THERE IS ANOTHER PIECE OF\nTHIS TAPE THAT HAS NEVER BEEN HEARD PUBLICLY BEFORE, WHICH WE\nHAVE GOT FOR YOU IN JUST A SECOND.\nAND THIS OTHER PIECE OF TAPE, I THINK THIS IS JUST LIKE A DART\nINTO THE HEART OF TODAY'S NEWS. AND IT'S ON A SUBJECT THAT HAS\nONLY COME UP A LITTLE BIT IN THE CAMPAIGN SO FAR.\nIT CAME UP FOR AN INSTANT EARLIER IN THIS CAMPAIGN WHEN\nDONALD TRUMP NAMED MIKE PENCE TO BE HIS RUNNING MATE.\nONE OF THE CONTROVERSIAL THINGS IN MIKE PENCE'S RECORD IS THAT\nHE IS ON RECORD BEING AGAINST WOMEN IN THE MILITARY.\nFROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF HIM RUNNING FOR CONGRESS, MIKE PENCE\nWAS AGAINST NOT JUST WOMEN IN COMBAT, BUT EVEN WOMEN BEING IN\nCOMBAT SUPPORT UNITS. HE WAS EVEN AGAINST WOMEN BEING\nALLOWED TO DO BASIC TRAINING FOR THE MILITARY.\nMIKE PENCE WROTE THIS CREEPY COLUMN IN 1999 ABOUT YOUNG\nNUBILE 18-YEAR-OLD WOMEN IN BASIC TRAINING.\nTHE COLUMN ENDS WITH THIS LINE, I KID YOU NOT.\nWOMEN IN THE MILITARY, BAD IDEA. THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE OF HIS\nCOLUMN ON WOMEN IN THE MILITARY. SO THAT'S ON RECORD ALREADY FROM\nMIKE PENCE, DONALD TRUMP'S RUNNING MATE, WHEN PENCE WAS A\nTALK RADIO HOST. THAT WAS THE TIME HE LOST\nRUNNING FOR CONGRESS. THAT RUN MOST REMEMBERED FOR\nMIKE PENCE USING CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS TO PAY FOR HIS\nMORTGAGE, HIS GROCERY BILLS, HIS CAR PAYMENT AND HIS GOLFING\nFEES. HE LET HIS DONORS PAY FOR ALL\nTHAT STUFF. IF MIKE PENCE WERE RUNNING IN\nANY NORMAL REPUBLICAN, I THINK HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A SCANDAL AS\nA RUNNING MATE. THINGS IN HIS RECORD WOULD HAVE\nBEEN A SCANDAL AND A PROBLEM TO HIS RUNNING MATE.\nIT IS TESTAMENT TO DONALD TRUMP THAT HE IS SO CONTROVERSIAL THAT\nPICKING MIKE PENCE WITH MIKE PENCE'S RECORD, IT HASN'T GIVEN\nDONALD TRUMP A SINGLE DAY OF HEARTBURN IN THE ENTIRE\nCAMPAIGN. I MEAN IF IN THIS CAMPAIGN\nANYBODY COULD PAY ATTENTION TO MIKE PENCE FOR MORE THAN TEN\nSECONDS WITHOUT PASSING OUT FOR LACK OF OXYGEN, THIS THING FROM\nHIM ABOUT WOMEN IN THE MILITARY, BAD IDEA, THAT WOULD BE A\nSCANDAL, RIGHT? THAT WOULD BE A PROBLEM FOR A\nCAMPAIGN. MAYBE IT WILL BE STILL SOME DAY.\nFOR A LONG TIME I FELT LIKE THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN A LURKING\nLIABILITY FOR TRUMP AND PENCE, JUST SORT OF WAITING AT SOME\nPOINT TO CAUSE THEM TROUBLE. WELL, NOW THAT TROUBLE MAY\nFINALLY BE COMING TO PASS, BECAUSE NOW WITH THIS NEW TAPE\nTHAT WE ARE ABOUT TO BROADCAST FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, THIS\nHAS NEVER BEEN HEARD PUBLICLY ANY TIME BEFORE, THIS IS THE\nFIRST TIME ANYWHERE, HERE IS DONALD TRUMP NOT 16 YEARS AGO OR\n18 YEARS AGO WHEN MIKE PENCE WAS TALKING ABOUT THIS STUFF, HERE'S\nDONALD TRUMP TWO YEARS AGO IN 2014, UNPROMPTED, ANSWERING A\nTOTALLY UNRELATED QUESTION. JUST DECIDING TO BRING UP\nVOLUNTARILY HIS DONALD TRUMP OPINION ON WOMEN IN THE\nMILITARY. >> WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG, WHAT DID\nYOU THINK OF THE '60s COUNTERCULTURE, THE HIPPIES, THE\nMUSIC? YOU DIDN'T DO ANY OF THAT STUFF.\n>> NO, I WASN'T INTO IT. IT WASN'T THAT I WASN'T INTO IT.\n>> WHAT DID YOU THINK? >> WELL, I WENT -- I WENT TO A\nMILITARY ACADEMY, WHICH WAS FROM A DIFFERENT PLANET.\nWE DIDN'T HAVE THAT. AND WE DIDN'T HAVE WOMEN IN THE\nACADEMY AT THAT TIME. TODAY YOU HAVE WOMEN, WHICH IS A\nWHOLE OTHER STORY, YOU KNOW, WOMEN IN THE ARMY, AND YOU SEE\nWHAT'S GOING ON. IT'S LIKE BEDLAM.\nIT IS BEDLAM. IT'S SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE\nAREN'T TALKING ABOUT, BUT WHAT'S GOING ON IS BEDLAM, BRINGING\nWOMEN IN THE ARMY. >> BRINGING WOMEN IN THE ARMY,\nWOMEN IN THE MILITARY, IT'S BEDLAM.\nAND HIS RUNNING MATE SAYS WOMEN IN THE MILITARY, BAD IDEA.\nASK MILITARY FAMILIES HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT THAT IN A POTENTIAL\nCOMMANDER IN CHIEF. ASK WOMEN IN THE MILITARY HOW\nTHEY FEEL ABOUT THAT IN A POTENTIAL COMMANDER IN CHIEF.\nASK WOMEN IN GENERAL HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT THAT.\nBRINGING WOMEN INTO THE ARMY, BEDLAM.\nIT'S SOMETHING PEOPLE AREN'T TALKING ABOUT, BUT WHAT'S GOING\nON IS BEDLAM. BRINGING WOMEN IN THE ARMY, IT'S\nBEDLAM. WOMEN IN THE MILITARY, BAD IDEA.\nTHE TWO OF THEM ARE IN LINE ON THAT QUESTION.\nIT IS, THEREFORE, A REASONABLE QUESTION TO ASK IF TRUMP AND\nPENCE DO GET ELECTED, WILL THEY KICK ALL WOMEN OUT OF THE\nMILITARY? THEY'RE BOTH ON RECORD SAYING IT\nIS A TERRIBLE THING THAT WOMEN ARE IN THE MILITARY.\nIT'S A TERRIBLE THING, IT'S EVEN",

EVERYBODY ON BOARD IS FINE,\nTHERE WERE NO INJURIES REPORTED INCLUDING TO GOVERNOR PENCE OR\nHIS FAMILY. THERE WERE BETWEEN 30 AND 40\nPEOPLE ON BOARD THE GOVERNOR'S JET, IT'S A CHARTERED 737.\nGOVERNOR PENCE, HIS WIFE, ONE OF HIS KIDS, ABOUT 15 SECRET\nSERVICE AGENTS AND A DOZEN MEMBERS OF THE PRESS WERE ON\nTHAT PLANE. WE ALSO THINK WE SAW A\nCONGRESSMAN FROM TEXAS. WE HEARD THAT A 737 USUALLY\nCOMES IN FOR A LANDING AT 155 MILES AN HOUR AND WHEN IT'S A\nWET, SLICK NIGHT LIKE TONIGHT, THIS KIND OF THING CAN HAPPEN.\nBUT THE FAA AND MAYBE THE NTSB WILL BE LOOKING INTO THIS\nINCIDENT TO DETERMINE EXACTLY WHAT CAUSED IT HERE.\nI'LL SHOW YOU AGAIN, THIS IS WHAT THE PLANE DID TO THE TARMAC\nAT LaGUARDIA AS IT SLID OFF THE RUNWAY.\nI DIDN'T KNOW THAT THAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU SLID OFF A RUNWAY.\nALL THE AIR TRAFFIC AT LaGUARDIA WAS SUSPENDED FOR OVER AN HOUR\nIN THE WAKE OF THIS INCIDENT. WE ARE TOLD AS SOON AS THE PLANE\nCAME TO A REST FOLLOWING ITS ROUGH LANDING AND ITS SLIDE INTO\nTHE GRASS WITH MUD FLYING UP AND HITTING THE WINDOWS, GOVERNOR\nPENCE IMMEDIATELY CAME TO THE BACK OF THE PLANE TO CHECK THAT\nEVERYBODY WAS OKAY. GOD BLESS HIM, THAT'S THE RIGHT\nTHING TO DO. AS YOU CAN SEE HE'S FINE.\nHE ALSO STOPPED WITH PHOTOS WITH FIRST RESPONDERS IN THE RAIN.\nHE HAD BEEN SCHEDULED TO ATTEND A FUND-RAISER IN NEW YORK CITY\nTONIGHT BUT HIS SPOKESMAN SAID INSTEAD HE IS HEADED TO HIS\nHOTEL FOR THE NIGHT, ABSOLUTELY TOTALLY UNDERSTANDABLE.\nABOUT AN HOUR AFTER THE INCIDENT THE GOVERNOR TWEETED SO THANKFUL\nEVERYONE ON OUR PLANE IS SAFE. GRATEFUL FOR OUR FIRST\nRESPONDERS AND THE CONCERN AND PRAYERS OF SO MANY.\nBACK ON THE TRAIL TOMORROW. AGAIN, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING\nHERE IS NO INJURIES AS FAR AS WE KNOW.\nBUT CERTAINLY SOME JANGLED NERVES AND SOME RUSHES OF\nADRENALINE AND NONE OF US NEED ANY OF THAT AT THIS TIME.\nJOINING US NOW IS A MAN ONBOARD THAT PLANE, VAUGHN HILLYARD.\nHE WAS ON THE PLANE WHEN IT SLID OFF THE RUNWAY.\nVAUGHN, LET ME SHAKE YOUR HAND. I'M GLAD YOU'RE OKAY.\nWERE YOU SCARED? >> NO.\nTHE CRAZY PART IS THIS WASN'T THE FIRST TIME -- FIRST TIME\nWE'VE GONE OFF THE RUNWAY, BUT WE'VE HAD A LOT OF SHAKY\nINCIDENTS IN THE PAST. HARD IMPACT, TOUGH LANDINGS.\nWE ACTUALLY PULLED OUT THE PHONE THIS TIME AND I SNAPPED\nORIGINALLY ABOUT TEN SECONDS OF VIDEO, WHICH I'M TRYING TO GET\nINTO THE SYSTEM HERE EVENTUALLY FOR EVERYBODY, BUT THE CRAZY\nPART WAS ORIGINALLY WE HAD THE HARD IMPACT AND THEN WE WENT TWO\nOR THREE SECONDS AND THAT'S WITH WE STARTED TO SWERVE OFF TO THE\nRIGHT. AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN WE COME\nTO JUST A HARD CRASHING STOP. AND THAT'S WHEN YOU LOOKED OUT\nTHE WINDOW AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THE ROAD WAS ODDLY CLOSE TO\nWHERE THE PLANE WAS AT. >> THE ROAD WITH CARS ON IT.\n>> THE ROAD WITH CARS. THE CIRCLE K ACROSS THE STREET.\nTHAT'S WHEN IT BECAME REAL. >> SO WHEN YOU SAY YOU WERE\nTRYING TO GET TAPE, YOU WERE FILMING AS YOU WERE LANDING.\nIS THAT BECAUSE YOU WERE EXPECTING A HARD LANDING BECAUSE\nYOU'VE HAD SO MANY? >> IT'S A JOKE.\nIT'S A JOKE HOW LONG ARE WE GOING TO LAST.\nTHAT'S THE PART THE FACT THAT I'M ON WITH YOU TONIGHT IS SORT\nOF THE INTERESTING END OF THIS. THIS CAMERA, WE'VE CAPTURED A\nLOT OF CRAZY THINGS IN THIS CAMPAIGN, BUT TO GET TO THE\nPOINT WHERE THIS IS THE NEWS OF THE NIGHT WAS --\n>> WAIT A SECOND. YOU'RE SAYING IT'S BECOME A JOKE\nHOW LONG ARE WE GOING TO LAST. YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE HARD\nLANDINGS ON THE PENCE CAMPAIGN PLANE SPECIFICALLY ARE SO\nFREQUENT AND SO NOTABLE THAT IT'S A POINT OF DISCUSSION AMONG\nTHE PRESS CORPS? >> YES.\nAND I'LL BE HONEST THAT I'VE NEVER PURSUED THAT.\nWE HAVEN'T PURSUED ASKING QUESTIONS FURTHER ABOUT THAT\nBECAUSE USUALLY WE DON'T FLY ON PRIVATE, I GUESS, CHARTER\nFLIGHTS ON CAMPAIGN. THIS IS MY FIRST CAMPAIGN\nCOVERING SO WE JUST TOOK IT FOR GRANTED.\n>> HAVE YOU ONLY HAD BAD LANDINGS IN HEAVY WEATHER?\n>> NO. WE LANDED IN FT. DODGE, IOWA,\nEARLIER AND WE HAD ANOTHER ROUGH LANDING WHERE WE HIT.\nIT FELT LIKE WE WENT BACK INTO THE AIR.\nYOU COULD SEE THE BLUE SKY AGAIN.\nOF COURSE WE DIDN'T GO OFF THE RUNWAY AT THAT POINT.\n>> I'M JUST GOING TO PUT THIS TO YOU.\nI'VE GOT A -- I WENT BACK AND LOOKED AT MY EARLIER COVERAGE\nABOUT SOMETHING INVOLVING THE MIKE PENCE CAMPAIGN.\nI AM SURE THIS IS JUST COINCIDENTAL, BUT THIS IS NOT\nTHE FIRST TIME THAT WE ON THIS SHOW HAVE TALKED ABOUT ISSUES\nINVOLVING MIKE PENCE'S CAMPAIGN PLANE.\nAND I'VE NEVER BEEN ON THAT CAMPAIGN PLANE SO IT'S NOT LIKE\nI WAS REPORTING A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE.\nIT WAS LATE LAST MONTH WE LEARNED THAT THE PILOT, WHO IS\nENTRUSTED WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WITH FLYING THE PENCE\nCAMPAIGN AND HIS PRESS CORPS AND HIS FAMILY AROUND THE COUNTRY,\nHE MADE NEWS BECAUSE HE WAS FIRED FOR AN UNUSUAL REASON.\nTHE GUARDIAN WAS FIRST TO REPORT THAT THE PILOT FOR THE PENCE\nPLANE UNTIL ONE MONTH AGO WAS A RETIRED POLICE OFFICER IN\nADDITION TO BEING PENCE'S PILOT. HE WAS THE CHAIRMAN OF DONALD\nTRUMP'S FLORIDA LAW ENFORCEMENT COALITION.\nAND \"THE GUARDIAN\" REPORTED THAT HE WAS ACTIVELY FACING CRIMINAL\nCHARGES OF AGGRAVATED BATTERY WITH A DEADLY WEAPON.\nIN 2015 HE HAD ALLEGEDLY DRIVEN OVER A CO-WORKER WITH HIS CAR\nTHREE TIMES ON PURPOSE, CAUSING THE CO-WORKER SEVERE PHYSICAL\nINJURIES. HIS NAME IS VINCENT CALDERA.\nHE PLED NOT GUILTY TO THOSE CHARGES BUT IT TURNED OUT THOSE\nWEREN'T THE ONLY CHARGES AGAINST HIM.\nHE WAS ACCUSED OF A SIMILAR INCIDENT IN 2014.\nIN THAT CASE HE WAS ACCUSED OF DRIVING INTO A WOMAN WITH HIS\nMOTORCYCLE ON PURPOSE AND SERIOUSLY INJURING HER.\n\"THE GUARDIAN\" REPORTED LAST MONTH HE HADN'T ACTUALLY BEEN\nFORMALLY CHARGED IN RELATION TO THAT EPISODE BECAUSE THEY HADN'T\nBEEN ABLE TO LOCATE HIM TO SERVE HIM WITH LEGAL PAPERS.\nMEANWHILE HE'S FLYING THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AROUND\nTHE COUNTRY. SO THAT'S THE PILOT WHO GOT\nFIRED FROM THE PENCE CAMPAIGN PLANE LAST MONTH.\nDO YOU KNOW WHO THEY REPLACED HIM WITH?\n>> I DO NOT KNOW WHO THE GENTLEMAN IS.\nTHEY SWITCH PEOPLE OUT. >> SO IT'S ROTATING?\n>> SO IT'S A ROTATING BASIS, YEAH.\n>> HOW OLD ARE YOU? >> 25.\n>> HAVE YOU DONE A LOT OF FLYING IN YOUR REPORTING JOB AND IN\nYOUR PERSONAL LIFE? >> YES.\n>> IS THE PENCE CAMPAIGN PLANE THE ONLY CAMPAIGN PLANE ON WHICH\nYOU HAVE HAD HARD LANDINGS LIKE THIS?\n>> THAT'S ACCURATE. >> THAT'S REALLY WEIRD.\nJOHN HILLYARD. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE\nRELATIONSHIP IS BETWEEN THESE TWO HALVES OF THIS STORY, BUT\nKNOWING THAT THIS RUNWAY THING HAPPENED TONIGHT AFTER A SERIES\nOF HARD LANDINGS THAT WAS A TOPIC OF DISCUSSION BY YOU GUYS,\nIT WEIRDS ME OUT AND WE WILL TRY TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT.\nAND I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE OKAY. THANKS.\nAPPRECIATE IT. NBC NEWS EMBED VAUGHN HILLYARD.\nHE'S GREAT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.",

THEY WILL BE PART SAN, THE\nREPUBLICANS, AND HILLARY CLINTON AS PRESIDENT WILL NOT BE GOING\nAFTER REPUBLICANS BECAUSE SHE CAN'T.\nSHE OBEYS THE LAW, THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS TO BE OBJECTIVE,\nNEUTRAL, NON-PARTISAN. >> MICHAEL, THERE'S A LOT OF\nREFUSE L REVELATIONS THAT HAVE COME OUT\nOF THESE WIKILEAKS, AND AS YOU SAID AND DOUGLAS SAID, IT IS NOT\nTHE BOMBSHELL THE REPUBLICANS HAD HOPED.\nBUT THE POSSIBILITY OF THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT DOING THIS,\nWOULD CHAFFETZ BASE HIS INVESTIGATIONS ON STOLEN\nDOCUMENTS FROM THE RUSSIANS? >> NO.\nIF IT IS FRAMED THAT WAY, HE CERTAINLY HE WOULDN'T, BUT I\nTHINK, YOU KNOW, HIS DETERMINATION TO PURSUE THE\nCLINTONS WILL PROBABLY OVERRIDE HIS RELUCTANCE TO BE SEEN AS\nDOING THE RUSSIAN'S BIDDING. BUT, YOU KNOW, THAT IS ANOTHER\nAREA WHERE LOOKING TO POST-ELECTION, WHERE THERE COULD\nWELL BE INVESTIGATIONS AND A LOT OF -- YOU KNOW, A LOT MORE TO\nFIND, WHICH IS JUST WHAT WERE THE RUSSIANS UP TO HERE, AND\nWERE THERE ASSOCIATIONS WITH PEOPLE IN THE TRUMP CAMP?\nWERE THEY TRYING TO AID AND FACILITATE DONALD TRUMP'S\nELECTION? WE DO KNOW PAUL MANAFORT,\nTRUMP'S FORMER CAMPAIGN MANAGER, IS BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE\nFBI, GROWS OUT OF SOME OF THE LEDGERS FOUND IN UKRAINE FOR\nPAYMENTS. SO I WOULDN'T BE SO SURE THAT\nYOU WOULDN'T SEE A CLINTON JUSTICE DEPARTMENT GOING AFTER\nPEOPLE IN THE TRUMP CAMP POST ELECTION BECAUSE OF SOME OF\nTHESE ASSOCIATIONS. >> I HOPE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN.\nI THINK CRIMINALIZING POLICY DIFFERENCES, WHETHER BY THE\nDEMOCRATS OR THE REPUBLICANS, IS A SERIOUS MISTAKE.\nI THINK ONCE THE ELECTION IS OVER YOU CAN HAVE INVESTIGATIONS\nAS TO WHETHER THE RUSSIANS WERE INVOLVED, BUT I THINK IT IS A\nTERRIBLE MISTAKE TO -- FOR THE WINNER TO GO AFTER THE LOSER\nTHROUGH THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IN A CRIMINAL WAY.\n>> AT LEAST IN RECENT HISTORY WE HAVE SEEN REPUBLICANS WANTING TO\nPROSECUTE DEMOCRATS, ESPECIALLY IF THEY GET INTO THE OFFICE THEY\nPROMISED -- YOU REMEMBER DONALD TRUMP SAID, HE CRITICIZED\nHILLARY CLINTON FOR NOT WANTING TO PROSECUTE OR GO AFTER THE\nFORMER PRESIDENT FOR IRAQ. WHY IS IT ALWAYS REPUBLICANS\nWANTING TO PROSECUTE DEMOCRATS? >> OH, BELIEVE ME, THERE ARE\nDEMOCRATS WHO WANT TO PROSECUTE REPUBLICANS.\n>> THEY NEVER FOLLOW UP ON IT. >> NO, AND FIRST OF ALL IT IS\nTHE RADICAL WING OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT LOSES,\nTHAT WANTS THAT. IF SANDERS GOT ELECTED, HE WOULD\nPROBABLY DO THAT. >> DO YOU THINK THE SAME WITH\nTHE REPUBLICAN PARTY, IT IS THE RADICAL WING OF THE REPUBLICAN\nPARTY AND NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN? >> I THINK THERE IS A RADICAL\nWING OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THESE DAYS WHERE THERE'S A\nCENTRIST WING OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.\n>> YOU HAVE A CLINTON SUPPORTER ERIC SCHNEIDERMAN WHO LAUNCHED\nAN INVESTIGATION INTO THE TRUMP FOUNDATION, SO THERE'S PLENTY TO\nGO AROUND. >> WHAT DO YOU SAY?\n>> I AM GOING TO BE HOPEFUL IF HILLARY CLINTON WINS, WHICH\nPOLLS LOOK LIKE SHE IS GOING TO, THAT THE COUNTRY RALLIES BEHIND\nHER AND THERE WILL BE A LITTLE BIT OF BIPARTISAN GOOD WILL FOR\nA WHILE. IT MIGHT BE NAIVE, BUT I'M\nTHINKING ON IMMIGRATION REFORM, PERHAPS INFRASTRUCTURE WE COULD\nHAVE SIX MONTHS OF POSITIVE ACTION ON CAPITOL HILL.\nTHIS IDEA OF SCORCHED EARTH POLICY CONTINUING ON BOTH SIDES,\nI DON'T KNOW IF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC HAS THE STOMACH FOR IT.\nI DO THINK HOW BIG A MARGIN HILLARY CLINTON WINS MATTERS AND\nWHETHER THE DEMOCRATS GET THE SENATE MATTERS.\nBUT IF TRUMP PULLS LESS THAN MITT ROMNEY AND JOHN McCAIN DID,\nIT IS NOT A TRUMP REVOLUTION, IT IS A TRUMP PETER OUT BRINGING\nTHE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN A BACKWARDS DIRECTION.\nI THINK YOU WILL SEE RESPONSIBLE REPUBLICANS WANTING TO TRY TO DO\nSOME BUSINESS AT LEAST FOR A LITTLE WHILE WITH HILLARY\nCLINTON. >> SO WHAT IF TRUMP WINS?\n>> WELL, IF TRUMP WINS IT IS A REVOLUTION, AND IT REALLY IS\nDRAINING OF THE SWAMP IN WASHINGTON.\nIT IS GOING TO BE -- YOU KNOW, IT HAS UNTOLD CONSEQUENCES IF HE\nCOMES IN, AND HE WILL TRY TO PROSECUTE HILLARY CLINTON.\nI BELIEVE HIS THREAT OF GOING TO JAIL.\nMEANWHILE, HE WILL HAVE -- SUPPOSEDLY WILL BE SUING A BEVY\nOF WOMEN THAT HAVE ACCUSED HIM OF HARASSMENT, AND WE'RE LOOKING\nAT A CIRCUS ATMOSPHERE AROUND THE INAUGURATION.\n>> HE WILL NEVER BRING THOSE LAWSUITS BECAUSE HE WOULD HAVE\nTO SUBMIT TO DISCOVERY. >> NO, NEVER.\n>> HE WOULD HAVE TO SIT DOWN FOR HOURS AND HOURS.\nBOY, WOULD I LOVE TO BE THE LAWYER CROSS-EXAMINING DONALD\nTRUMP ABOUT HIS SEXUAL HISTORY. I REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED WHEN\nBILL CLINTON FOOLISHLY AGREED TO BE DEPOSED WHEN HE COULD HAVE\nEASILY SETTLED THE CASE. DONALD TRUMP, NO, NO DECENT\nLAWYER WILL ALLOW DONALD TRUMP TO BRING A LAWSUIT ABOUT\nANYTHING SEXUAL, BELIEVE ME, TO QUOTE DONALD TRUMP.\nBELIEVE ME. >> STICK AROUND, EVERYONE.\nHOLD THAT THOUGHT AND THEN WE WILL GET TO IT ON THE OTHER SIDE\nOF THE BREAK. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.\n\u00e2\u0099\u00aa",

REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING, WE DON'T\nWANT A FULL SUPREME COURT. WE WILL STOP IT.\nWE DON'T CARE WHO IT IS. I'M GLAD JOHN McCAIN WALKED THAT\nBACK. HE SHOULD HAVE.\nBUT SOME OF THESE THREATS ARE DESIGNED TO MAKE SURE IF HILLARY\nCLINTON WINS SHE DOESN'T GO WITH SOMEBODY TOO PROGRESSIVE, THAT\nHER CHOICE IS SOMEBODY IN A KIND OF CENTRIST AT THE VERY LEAST,\nOR CENTER RIGHT KIND OF MODE. SHE WILL HAVE TO DETERMINE WHO\nHER CHOICE IS. SO I DON'T WANT TO SAY THOSE\nREPUBLICANS ARE GIVING VEILED THREATS, BUT THEY'RE LETTING HER\nKNOW DON'T GO HARD LEFT ON US. WE DON'T WANT A WILLIAM O.\nDOUGLAS ON US. >> DOESN'T IT SOUND LIKE MAYER\nGARLAND, MICHAEL? >> I WAS SAYING THAT'S THE FIRST\nQUESTION SHE IS GOING TO HAVE TO CONFRONT ON THIS, DOES SHE\nRESUBMIT MERRITT GARLAND ASSUMING HE DOESN'T GET\nCONFIRMED IN A LAME DUCK SESSION AFTER THE ELECTION.\nYOU KNOW, THAT'S SOMEWHAT A TOUGH CHOICE BECAUSE HE WAS\nSELECTED BECAUSE HE IS SEEN AS A CENTRIST DEMOCRAT, MODERATE,\nSOMEBODY WHO CAN -- REPUBLICANS LIKE OR INHATCH HAD SUPPORTED IN\nTHE PAST. BUT TO THE PROGRESSIVE BASE OF\nTHE PARTY, HE'S NOT THE KIND OF SUPREME COURT JUSTICE THAT THEY\nARE GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR. SO I THINK THERE COULD BE SOME\nREAL ISSUES ON THAT. >> AND, REMEMBER, THE\nCONSTITUTION SAYS WITH THE ADVICE AND CONSENT OF THE\nSENATE. I'M A REPUBLICAN SENATOR, I GIVE\nMY ADVICE TO PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HILLARY CLINTON AND SAY,\nRENOMINATE MERRICK GARLAND, WE'LL CONFIRM HIM BUT NOBODY TO\nTHE LEFT OF HIM. IF THEY DO THAT, IT WILL SEND A\nPOWER OF MESSAGE THE REPUBLICANS ARE WILLING TO PLAY WITH THE\nDEMOCRATS AS LONG AS THE DEMOCRATS DON'T TRY TO USE THEIR\nELECTION TO DETERMINE THE SUPREME COURT FOR YEARS TO COME\nAS A LEFTIST INSTITUTION. >> SO IF THEY KNOW, JUSTICIS --\nGO AHEAD. WHO WAS THAT?\n>> IT WAS DOUG. I WAS GOING THE SAY KEEP IN MIND\nHILLARY CLINTON IS DOING EVERYTHING SHE CAN TO HAVE A\nDEMOCRATIC SENATE, AND THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS.\nIF THE DEMOCRATS TAKE OVER THE SENATE, SOMEBODY LIKE GARLAND\nWILL BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH THIS PROCESS QUITE EASILY.\nBUT I THINK ALAN NAILED IT. SHE IS GOING TO HAVE A CHOICE OF\nDOUBLING DOWN ON GARLAND OR PICKING SOMEBODY, PERHAPS AN\nASIAN AMERICAN, AND STICKING IT TO THE REPUBLICANS IN ANOTHER\nFASHION. I BELIEVE WE'LL HAVE OUR NINTH\nSUPREME COURT JUSTICE IN 2017. >> DOUGLAS, I WANTED TO ASK YOU,\nIS THERE AN INCENTIVE IN THERE, IF YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE A JUSTICE\nAND YOU KNOW YOUR SEAT IS NOT GOING TO BE FILLED, DOES IT LEAD\nYOU IN ANY WAY THE RETIRE OR NOT TO RETIRE?\n>> OF COURSE THERE'S POLITICS IN THINGS, BUT IF YOU'RE NOT GOING\nTO -- BUT HEALTH USUALLY IS WHAT GETS PEOPLE, BUT HILLARY CLINTON\nNOW HAS ONE POST TO FILL. IF YOU ELECT HER, SHE PROBABLY\nIS GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER VACANCY ON HER HANDS.\nSO IT WILL START BEING AN OBAMA/HILLARY CLINTON SUPREME\nCOURT. THAT'S BEEN THE KEY POINT THAT\nDONALD TRUMP'S BEEN TRYING TO BRING THE RIGHT BACK HOME, THE\nTED CRUZ REPUBLICANS SAYING, HILLARY CLINTON WINS, WE'RE\nPROBABLY GOING TO HAVE TWO MORE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES THAT\nDON'T THINK AS CONSTITUTIONALLISTS LIKE WE DO.\n>> BUT REMEMBER, TOO, THE LAST THREE WHO RETIRED FROM THE\nSUPREME COURT DIDN'T RETIRE FOR HEALTH REASONS.\nSOU O'CONNOR HAD THE OPTION NOT TO.\nEVEN STEVENS WHO WAS VERY OLD WAS QUITE HEALTHY.\nI THINK IT WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON KEEPING JUSTICES ON THE\nSUPREME COURT BECAUSE THEY CARE ABOUT THE INSTITUTION.\nSHE DON'T WANT THE INSTITUTION TO BE --\n>> YOU SAID WELL INTO THEIR 90s. >> IT COULD GO INTO THEIR 90s,\nYEAH. >> JUSTICE CLARENCE THOMAS WAS\nASKED ABOUT GRID LOCK IN WASHINGTON AND HE SAID THIS, THE\nCITY IS BROKEN IN SOME WAYS AND WE ARE DESTROYING OUR\nINSTITUTIONS. DO YOU AGREE?\n>> YEAH, I THINK MOST OF THE COUNTRY AGREES WITH THAT, FOR\nDIFFERENT REASONS, BUT, YOU KNOW, THE DYSFUNCTIONAL NATURE\nOF WASHINGTON, THE INABILITY OF CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT TO\nWORK TOGETHER ON ANYTHING, YOU KNOW, HAS BEEN -- YOU KNOW, IT\nHAS CERTAINLY BEEN A MAJOR FACTOR IN DONALD TRUMP'S RISE.\nTHE PERCEPTION THAT WE NEED TO THROW, YOU KNOW, ALL OF THE\nRASCALS OUT, THAT'S WHY HE GOT AS FAR AS HE DID.\nYOU KNOW, WERE IT NOT FOR HIS MANIFEST FLAWS ON SO MANY OTHER\nFRONTS HE PROBABLY WOULD BE DOING A LOT BETTER AGAINST\nHILLARY CLINTON, WHO FOR BETTER OR WORSE IS SEEN AS SOMEBODY WHO\nHAS BEEN AROUND FOR MANY YEARS AND IS AN ESTABLISHMENT FIGURE\nWHO IS PART OF THE SYSTEM IN WASHINGTON.\n>> DOUGLAS, IF THE COUNTRY AGREES WITH THAT, THEN WHY DON'T\nTHEY ELECT PEOPLE WHO CAN WORK TOGETHER?\n>> WELL, LOOK, FIRST OFF, ON THAT WHOLE BROKEN ARGUMENT,\nBARACK OBAMA HAS A 55% APPROVAL RATING.\nTHAT'S NOT BROKEN. THAT'S THE NUMBERS OF RONALD\nREAGAN AND THAT'S THE NUMBERS OF BILL CLINTON AT HIS ZENITH,\nMEANING PEOPLE ARE BELIEVING IN OBAMA, THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION\nIS DOING WELL. HILLARY CLINTON HERE MIGHT WIN\nAN ABSOLUTE HISTORIC ELECTION AS THE FIRST WOMAN.\nI THINK WHAT IS BROKEN IS CONGRESS.\nCONGRESS HAS ABOUT, YOU KNOW, A 15% OR LOWER APPROVAL RATING,\nAND THAT IS A PROBLEM. I DON'T THINK THE SUPREME COURT\nIS BROKEN IF WE GET A NINTH IN. OUR ARMED FORCES CERTAINLY\nAREN'T BROKEN. I DON'T THINK THE EXECUTIVE\nBRANCH ARE BROKEN. IT IS THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH\nTHAT'S A MESS. >> I DO THINK PEOPLE DON'T VOTE\nTO MAKE SURE PEOPLE CAN WORK TOGETHER.\nTHEY VOTE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL CANDIDATE.\nTHEY VOTE FOR A PRESIDENT THEY LIKE, THEY VOTE FOR A SENATOR\nTHEY LIKE. THE EFFECT IS EITHER TO HAVE\nGRID LOCK OR TO HAVE WORKING TOGETHER, BUT VERY FEW PEOPLE\nCAST A VOTE IN ORDER TO DECREASE GRID LOCK OR INCREASE WORKING\nTOGETHER. I THINK THAT'S WHY WE GET GRID\nLOCK, BECAUSE IT IS AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF VOTING\nFOR INDIVIDUALS. >> SO THE VOTE IS EMOTIONAL\nRATHER THAN -- >> WELL, NO, IT CAN BE --\n>> -- CEREBRAL. >> IT CAN BE BOTH CEREBRAL AND\nEMOTIONAL, BUT IT IS NOT TACTICAL.\nIT USUALLY DOESN'T INVOLVE, WELL, I WILL VOTE FOR THE\nPRESIDENT AND SENATOR OF A DIFFERENT PARTY BECAUSE I WANT\nTO MAKE SURE THERE'S GRID LOCK. THERE'S AN ATTEMPT TO DO THAT BY\nREPUBLICANS SAYING, PLEASE VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE\nBECAUSE WE THINK HILLARY CLINTON WILL WIN AND WE DON'T WANT TO\nGIVE HER HER WAY WITHOUT CHECKS AND BALANCES.\n>> THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN. FASCINATING CONVERSATION.\nSEE YOU NEXT TIME. >> THANK YOU.\n>> WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK. \u00e2\u0099\u00aa",

THE DOG WHISTLING NEVER STOPS\nFROM DONALD TRUMP TO THESE PEOPLE.\nAND THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THIS IS A GUY --\n>> SO BEING AGAINST ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IS DOG WHISTLING\nACCORDING TO THEM? THIS IS HOW RIDICULOUS THE\nDISCOURSE HAS BECOME, RICK. >> THIS IS A GUY WHO IS FEEDING\nTHESE PEOPLE WITH A NOD AND A WINK EVERY SINGLE DAY, A GUY WHO\nCONSTANTLY DENIGRATES WOMEN, MUSLIMS, MINORITIES IN A HOST OF\nDIFFERENT WAYS. I'M NOT SAYING EVERY PERSON WHO\nSUPPORTS DONALD TRUMP IS A RACIST, THAT'S ABSURD.\nEVERY RACIST YOU TURN OVER -- EVERY TIME YOU TURN OVER A ROCK\nAND FIND A RACIST, THEY HAVE A RED M.A.G.A. HAT ON.\nTHERE IS NOT A -- THERE'S NOT A COINCIDENCE HERE.\n>> LET ME ASK YOU THIS ABOUT HOW FOLKS ARE FEELING INSIDE THE\nCAMPAIGN. HE WATCHES A LOT OF TV, DONALD\nTRUMP. NOTICE THAT?\nHE WATCHES A LOT OF CABLE NEWS. >> HE ENJOYS BEING INFORMED.\nTHAT'S TO HIS CREDIT. HE WATCHES CABLE NEWS.\n>> THERE'S OBVIOUSLY SORT OF THIS PERCEPTUAL THING, EVERY\nCAMPAIGN I'VE EVER COVERED UP UNTIL THE DAY YOU'RE THERE, I'VE\nBEEN WITH CANDIDATES WHO ARE DOWN 40 POINTS SAYING WE'RE\nGOING TO WIN, SHOCK THE WORLD. NO ONE GOES AROUND SAYING, WE'RE\nGETTING OUR BUTTS KICKED. >> IT DOES HAPPEN.\n>> I GUESS MY POINT IS, LIKE, YOU GUYS FEEL YOU ARE PREPARED,\nHOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE THE RACE?\nTIED, CLOSE, DONALD TRUMP IS WINNING?\n>> WE'RE WINNING IN THE KEY THAT I CARE ABOUT, FLORIDA.\nSO I WOULD SAY -- I WOULDN'T SAY IT'S A DEAD HEAT.\nI WOULD SAY WE'RE SLIGHTLY AHEAD.\n>> THERE'S ONE POLL OUT TODAY -- >> IF YOU SAID IT WAS A DEAD\nHEAT, I'D SAY THAT'S FAIR. IT'S ANYBODY'S RACE RIGHT NOW.\n>> RICK, DO YOU THINK -- HOW MUCH DOES WHAT HAPPENS ON\nELECTION DAY MATTER TO THE VALIDITY OF THAT STATEMENT ABOUT\nWE OWN THE FUTURE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY?\nWHICH IS TO SAY IF DONALD TRUMP WINS, OBVIOUSLY, THAT'S ONE\nSCENARIO, IF HE OUTPERFORMED MITT ROMNEY OR UNDERPERFORMS\nJOHN McCAIN, DOES THAT -- DOES THE RANGE OF OPTIONS HERE MATTER\nIN TERMS OF WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING TO THE REPUBLICAN\nPARTY? >> YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK IT\nDOES, CHRIS, BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP'S BRAND IS SO DEEPLY\nOFFENSIVE TO SO MANY AMERICANS THAT I THINK THAT, LOOK,\nREPUBLICANS RAN CAMPAIGNS AGAINST DEMOCRATS FOR 40 YEARS\nUSING TED KENNEDY AND JIMMY CARTER AS SORT OF THE DEMONS OUT\nTHERE. THE REPRESENTED THE WORST OF\nLIBERAL EXCESS, ET CETERA. DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO HAVE\nDONALD TRUMP TO HANG AROUND THE NECKS OF REPUBLICANS BECAUSE THE\nREPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP IN THIS COUNTRY HAS FAILED AGAIN AND\nAGAIN AND AGAIN TO HOLD DONALD TRUMP TO ACCOUNT, TO MAKE HIM\nCONFORM TO THE VALUES THAT THE PARTY CLAIMS IT REPRESENTS, AND\nTO SHOW SOME SPINE AND BACKBONE WHEN THIS GUY CONTINUES TO DO\nTHINGS THAT ARE PROFOUNDLY OFFENSIVE TO WOMEN, TO\nMINORITIES, TO MUSLIMS. THIS IS A GUY WHO'S -- HE'S LIKE\nA 360 DEGREE OFFENSE MACHINE. YOU CAN BE -- THIS GUY WILL\nATTACK PEOPLE NO MATTER WHO THEY ARE AND THAT DAMAGE IS GOING TO\nSPREAD THROUGHOUT THE REPUBLICAN INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE ITS\nLEADERS FAILED AGAIN AND AGAIN TO STAND UP AND TO STAND FOR THE\nPRINCIPLES THAT THEY CLAIM THE PARTY REPRESENTS.\n>> DO YOU THINK -- DO YOU THINK IT MATTERS, OBVIOUSLY IF HE\nWINS, HE BECOMES PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, THAT MATTERS\nA LOT. DO YOU THINK IT MATTERS IF HE\nDOESN'T WIN, WHAT THE NON-WIN LOOKS LIKE?\n>> NO, WE WILL WIN. >> I DO THINK THE --\n>> AT THE END OF THE DAY, RICK, GETTING BACK TO WHAT YOU SAID,\nTHOUGH, ABOUT, LOOK, MAYBE THERE IS RACISTS OUT THERE THAT WEARS\nA M.A.G.A. HAT. THERE PROBABLY IS.\nI WON'T DISPUTE THAT. >> I'VE ENCOUNTERED THEM.\n>> WHO WILL BENEFIT MINORITIES MORE?\nTHEY HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THINGS LIKE THIS BECAUSE THEY WON'T\nBEAT US ON THE ISSUES. EVEN ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, IT'S\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS WHO SUFFER FROM IT MOST.\n>> A.J. -- >> ANTI-RACIST PLATFORM AND\nPOLICIES BELONG TO DONALD TRUMP. NOT TO HILLARY CLINTON.\n>> I WILL CONCLUDE -- I WILL CONCLUDE THIS BY SAYING --\n>> NOT AT ALL, LOOK AT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.\n>> I THINK VOTERS WILL HAVE SOME SORT OF REFERENDUM ON THAT WE'LL\nFIND OUT ON ELECTION DAY.

DONALD TRUMP SPEAKING RIGHT NOW\nAT A RALLY IN OHIO, A STATE THAT IS A DEAD, DEAD HEAT.\nJOINING ME NOW, SENATOR SHERROD BROWN, DEMOCRAT FROM OHIO.\nHE EARLY VOTED A COUPLE DAYS AGO WITH HIS WIFE, CONNIE SCHULTZ.\nSENATOR, BEFORE WE GET TO OHIO, ALSO SOME IMPORTANT BUSINESS\nTAKING PLACE IN CLEVELAND AND CHICAGO, YOU HAD A CLOSE BRUSH,\nYOURSELF, YOU GOT INTO A CAR ACCIDENT A FEW DAYS AGO.\nSOUNDED LIKE IT WAS SCARY. I HAVE TO READ THE TWEET AFTER\nTHIS -- YOUR CAR ACCIDENT. \"THANKS FOR CARING CONCERN,\nDOING FINE. GRATEFUL TO PARMA POLICE,\nMEDICAL STAFF AND MY JEEP MADE WITH AMERICAN STEEL BY UNION\nWORKERS IN TOLEDO.\" I HAVE TO TIP MY CAP FOR BEING\nON MESSAGE IN YOUR RESPONSE TO A CAR ACCIDENT.\n>> I ALSO SAID BETTER TO HAPPEN TO ME THAN COREY KLUBER, SO\nSOMEBODY'S GOING TO GET HURT, THAT WEEK, BETTER ME THAN THE\nINDIANS' CY YOUNG WINNER SO YOU TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM.\nI KNOW YOU'RE A CUBS FAN, EVERYBODY IN AMERICA FEELS SORRY\nFOR THE CUBS BECAUSE IT'S BEEN SO MANY YEARS.\nCHICAGO WINS BASKETBALL, NBA, NFL, I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT\nHOCKEY. >> SO MUCH WINNING, YOUR HEAD\nWILL SPIN. >> WHITE SOX WON.\nIT'S CLEVELAND'S TURN, MAN. BACK OFF.\n>> YOU GUYS WON. YOU GUYS HAD AN AMAZING WIN LAST\nYEAR FOR THAT CITY WHICH I THINK YOU COULD PALPABLY FEEL HOW\nINCREDIBLE IT WAS WHEN WE WERE THERE THIS SUMMER.\nCLEVELAND INDIANS PLAYING GREAT BASEBALL IN THESE PLAYOFFS.\nI'M VERY EXCITED. I WILL BE AT WRIGLEY SATURDAY\nNIGHT. I'M EXCITED ABOUT THAT.\nLET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR STATE. THIS IS A HEAVY LIFT.\nIT'S REALLY INTERESTING GOING THROUGH DATA, LOOKING SORT OF\nGETTING IN THERE. YOU'RE SEEING THIS INTERESTING\nTHING HAPPEN IN THIS RACE WHERE YOU GOT A STATE LIKE VIRGINIA\nWHERE, YOU KNOW, TWO CYCLES AGO PEOPLE SAID DEMOCRATS IN\nVIRGINIA, I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY'RE GOING TO WIN VIRGINIA,\nDEMOCRATS NOW, HILLARY CLINTON, THEY'RE UP BY SIZABLE PORTIONS.\nIT IS ABSOLUTELY NECK AND NECK IN OHIO.\n>> VIRGINIA, ACTUALLY, BOTH IN '08 AND '12, THE MARGINS WERE\nBIGGER FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA IN VIRGINIA THAN OHIO.\nOHIO ALMOST ALWAYS GOES WITH THE WINNER.\nHILLARY IS GOING TO WIN OHIO. THE POLLS ARE VERY CLOSE NOW.\nI CAN SEE TWO THINGS HAPPENING. I CAN SEE UNION MEMBERS WHO\nMIGHT HAVE FLIRTED WITH TRUMP A LITTLE BIT ARE COMING AROUND TO\nVOTE FOR HILLARY. I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN\nUNION HALLS, A LOT OF TIME TALKING TO WORKERS, AND UNION\nACTIVISTS ARE TALKING TO THEIR CO-WORKERS THAT ALSO BELONG TO\nTHE UNION AND ARE NOT YET THERE AND ARE MOVING TOWARD HILLARY.\nTHE OTHER THING THAT'S HAPPENING, A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE\nTHAT MAY HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT GARY JOHNSON IN JULY AND AUGUST AND\nSEPTEMBER ARE NOW REALIZING THAT, ONE, HE DOESN'T REALLY\nREPRESENT WHAT THEY BELIEVE, AND SECOND, THEY UNDERSTAND THAT HOW\nIMPORTANT IT IS SO VOTE FOR HILLARY AGAINST TRUMP.\nSO SHE'S GOING TO WIN THE STATE. IT'S GOING TO BE NOT AS -- IT'S\nGOING TO BE CLOSER THAN MAYBE VIRGINIA, CERTAINLY\nPENNSYLVANIA, WISCONSIN, MICHIGAN.\nSHE'S GOING TO DO WELL HERE. >> IT'S AMAZING WHEN YOU LOOK AT\nCOUNTY BREAKDOWNS IN A STATE LIKE OHIO WHERE DEMOCRATS HAVE\nENORMOUS MARGINS IN MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREAS.\nTHEY THEN HAVE TO SORT OF FIGHT TO KEEP THAT MARGIN IN RURAL\nAREAS, PARTICULARLY. THERE WAS THIS MOMENT ON FOX\nNEWS I WANTED TO PLAY YOU IN WHICH IT WAS SORT OF A CAT OUT\nOF THE BAG MOMENT ABOUT WHAT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT WITH BILL\nHEMMER TALKING TO SEAN SPICER. TAKE A LISTEN.\n>> I'M LOOKING AT EARLY VOTING. >> SO ARE WE.\nYOU HAVE GOOD NEWS IN OHIO. >> WE DO.\n>> WHITE SHARE OF THE VOTE IS UP THREE POINTS.\nBLACK SHARE OF THE VOTE IS DOWN SEVEN.\n>> EARLY VOTE IS WHERE DEMOCRATS DO WELL.\nWE DO VERY WELL ON ELECTION DAY. REPUBLICANS TEND TO SHOW UP.\nDEMOCRATS NEED TO DO VERY, VERY WELL.\nI'M TALKING -- I'M TALKING ABOUT MAIL-IN BALLOTS.\nI'M NOT TALKING ABOUT IN-PERSON VOTING.\n>> I UNDERSTAND THAT. >> I MEAN, AT ONE LEVEL IT'S\nTRUE, RIGHT, THAT IS GOOD NEWS FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, BUT\nIT'S ALSO SORT OF JUST REMARKABLE THING TO THINK ABOUT\nIN THE CONTEXT OF WHERE WE ARE IN TERMS OF AN AMERICAN\nDEMOCRACY. >> YEAH, THEY -- I MEAN, IT'S\nABOUT SUPPRESSING THE VOTE FOR THIS CROWD.\nLOOK AT TEXAS. I MEAN, TEXAS, IF YOU HAVE A\nUNIVERSITY OF TEXAS STUDENT I.D., THAT DOESN'T GET YOU A\nBALLOT, BUT IF YOU HAVE A CONCEALED WEAPON PERMIT, THAT\nDOES GET YOU A BALLOT. AND LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE DOING,\nNORTH CAROLINA AND OHIO, THE REPUBLICANS ELIMINATED WHAT'S\nCALLED GOLDEN WEEK. >> GOLDEN WEEK.\n>> THE WEEK YOU COULD REGISTER AND VOTE.\nCREATED BIPARTISANLY BY THE LEGISLATURE, SIGNED BY\nREPUBLICAN GOVERNOR BOB TAFT WHO IS REALLY A REAL MODERATE,\nDECENT REPUBLICAN. HE'S NOT THE RIGHT WING THAT\nTHEY'VE ALL BECOME. THE RIGHT WINGERS THEY'VE\nBECOME. BUT THEY'VE CLAWED ALL THIS\nBACK, SO IN OHIO IT IS A SHORTER WINDOW, A SMALLER WINDOW TO VOTE\nEARLY, BUT THE -- THEY'RE GOING TO BE THERE.\nI MEAN, DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO BE THERE.\nPEOPLE OF COLOR ARE GOING TO BE THERE.\nPEOPLE THAT WANT TO SUPPORT HILLARY ARE GOING TO BE THERE IN\nEARLY VOTING. WE WILL CATCH UP AND DO BETTER,\nIF IN FACT, I'M NOT SURE OF THE NUMBER, IF, IN FACT, WE'RE NOT\nDOING AS WELL AS WE WERE FOUR YEARS AGO.\n>> THAT WASN'T A LEFTY PLOT BY A.C.O.R.N., GOLDEN WEEK WAS JUST\nTHIS IDEA YOU COULD GO REGISTER AND VOTE AT THE SAME TIME, IT\nWAS THE SAME PERIOD OF TIME AND IT WAS GOOD FOR TURNOUT.\nIT WAS GOOD FOR PARTICIPATION. THE REPUBLICANS IN CONTROL OF\nTHE STATE JUST GOT RID OF THAT AND THEY DIDN'T GET RID OF IT\nWITH SOME, ANY ARGUMENT ABOUT VOTER FRAUD.\nTHEY JUST GOT RID OF IT. >> YEAH, AND THERE WAS A CASE\nTHAT WENT TO FEDERAL COURT THEN IT WAS OVERTURNED AFTER ONE OF\nTHESE REGISTRATION -- ONE OF THESE ROLLBACK, CLAWBACK ON\nREGISTRATION ON OPENING UP REGISTRATION, A GEORGE BUSH\nJUDGE VOTED IN FAVOR OF KEEPING THE REGISTRATION MORE OPEN AND\nLIBERAL AND AN APPELLATE CIRCUIT JUDGE, CIRCUIT COURT REVERSED\nIT. YOU'VE SEEN IT, THE SECRETARY OF\nSTATE NOW IN OHIO HAS PURGED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF VOTERS.\nSO WE'RE SEEING THIS EFFORT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.\nAS YOU KNOW, CHRIS, AS YOU POINT OUT IN THE SHOW, FIRST TIME IN\n50 YEARS THE VOTING RIGHTS ABOUT WON'T BE ENFORCED IN STATES\nAROUND THE COUNTRY AND IT'S CLEARLY SUPPRESSING THE VOTE.\nTHE ONLY WAY THEY CAN WIN IS TO DO THAT.\nTHEY KNOW THAT THEIR IDEAS DON'T WORK.\nEVEN IF THEY HAD A BETTER CANDIDATE, THEIR IDEAS AREN'T\nSELLING SO THEY SUPPRESS THE VOTE.\n>> ALL RIGHT. SENATOR SHERROD BROWN, THANKS\nFOR JOINING US. GO, CUBS.\n>> ENJOY SATURDAY NIGHT. >> I WILL.\n>> NOT TOO MUCH, CHRIS.",

GOING OFF THE TARMAC MADE IT A\nLITTLE BIT WORSE. BUT HE CALLED INTO THE\nFUND-RAISER AND TALKED TO THE PEOPLE.\nHALLIE JACKSON ALSO REPORTED THAT MIKE PENCE TALKED WITH\nDONALD TRUMP IN THE MOTORCADE BACK ON THE WAY TO MANHATTAN.\nHE IS GOING TO BE IN MANHATTAN OVERNIGHT.\nHE'LL BE DOING SOME MORNING SHOWS AS WELL.\nHE'S ON \"MORNING JOE\" IN THE MORNING, OR SO IS THE PLAN NOW.\nTHE CAMPAIGN SAYS THAT A NEW CAMPAIGN PLANE IS ALREADY ON THE\nWAY TO LaGUARDIA, WHICH IT WILL TAKE OFF TOMORROW.\n>> VAUGHN, FOR FOLKS WHO ARE JUST JOINING, CAN YOU JUST TELL\nUS AGAIN WHAT HAPPENED ON THAT PLANE?\n>> Reporter: SURE. SO WE WERE LANDING, AND THIS IS\nNOT THE FIRST TIME WE'VE HAD A BUMPY PLANE.\nWE'VE NEVER GOT OFF THE RUNWAY BEFORE.\nBUT WE WERE FLYING INTO LaGUARDIA THROUGH THE CLOUDS,\nTHROUGH THE RAIN. WE HAD A VERY SUDDEN ROUGH\nIMPACT UPON LANDING, BUT THEN FOR ABOUT TWO, THREE SECONDS, IT\nCONTINUED TO GO DOWN THE RUNWAY. AT THAT POINT IT WAS KIND OF A\nSHARP VEER TO THE RIGHT, IN WHICH THAT'S THE POINT WHERE IT\nREALLY FELT LIKE WE WERE SWERVING OFF THE TARMAC.\nAND THEN THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF IMPACT AS WE WERE GOING\nTHROUGH THE GRASS, WHICH TURNED INTO MUD, AND THAT'S WHEN WE\nREALIZED THAT WE CAME TO A VERY SUDDEN STOP AND REALIZED THAT WE\nWERE IN FACT OFF THE TARMAC. FIRE TRUCKS, AMBULANCES, QUICKLY\nRUSHED TO THE SCENE, THE LIGHTS WENT UP AND WE COULD SEE HOW\nCLOSE, WE SAW SOME SHOTS EARLIER IN WHICH YOU COULD SEE HOW CLOSE\nWE WERE TO THE ROADWAY. THAT'S WHEN IT BECAME REAL.\nWE'VE KIND OF TAKEN IT FOR GRANTED ROUGH IMPACTS ON THE\nPENCE CAMPAIGN PLANE BUT THAT WAS OBVIOUS WHEN YOU SAW THE\nROAD AND THE LIGHTS THAT THIS WASN'T A NORMAL LANDING HERE AT\nLaGUARDIA. >> I'M SO HAPPY YOU'RE SAFE.\nMIKE PENCE TWEETING SO HAPPY EVERYONE ON OUR PLANE IS SAFE.\nGRATEFUL FOR THE FIRST RESPONDERS --\n>> Reporter: THEY WERE THERE QUICKLY.\n>> VAUGHN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANKS FOR THE GREAT WORK\nYOU DID TAKING THAT FOOTAGE AS WELL.\nALL RIGHT. SO DONALD TRUMP IS IN OHIO.\nMIKE PENCE TRAVELING FROM IOWA BACK TO NEW YORK.\nMEANWHILE EARLIER TODAY, MICHELLE OBAMA AND HILLARY\nCLINTON ON STAGE TOGETHER FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME AT AN EVENT\nIN NORTH CAROLINA. HERE IS WHAT THAT LOOKED LIKE.\n>> HILLARY DOESN'T PLAY. SHE HAS MORE EXPERIENCE AND\nEXPOSURE TO THE PRESIDENCY THAN ANY CANDIDATE IN OUR LIFETIME.\nYES, MORE THAN BARACK, MORE THAN BILL, AND, YES, SHE HAPPENS TO\nBE A WOMAN. >> JOINING ME NOW, MICHELLE\nBERNARD, PRESIDENT AND CEO FOR THE BERNARD CENTER, JOY REID,\nHOST OF \"A.M. JOY\" RIGHT HERE ON MSNBC AND CHARLIE PIERCE, WRITER\nAT LARGE AT \"ESQUIRE.\" MICHELLE, I WANT TO ASK YOU\nTHIS. THE GENDER GAP WE'VE SEEN OPEN\nUP, HOW MUCH IS THAT GENDER GAP, BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S\nWORKING IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. IT'S NOT ONLY THAT DONALD TRUMP\nHAS BRAGGED ABOUT SERIAL SEXUAL ASSAULT AND NOW BEEN ACCUSED BY\n12 DIFFERENT WOMEN ON THE RECORD.\nHE USED TO RUN BEAUTY CONTESTS, ALL SORTS OF THINGS.\nTHERE'S ALSO THE FIRST WOMEN NOMINEE IN MAJOR PARTY HISTORY.\nHOW MUCH OF THAT WEDGE IS EACH OF THOSE FACTORS IN YOUR MIND?\n>> YOU KNOW WHAT, IT IS -- IT IS REALLY SO HARD TO TELL.\nI'LL TELL YOU, FROM ONE DAY TO ANOTHER I CHANGE MY MIND.\nI WOULD AT FIRST THINK THAT ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE HEARD\nCOME UP WITH DONALD TRUMP WOULD PUSH SO MANY WOMEN TOWARDS\nHILLARY CLINTON, AND WE'VE SEEN THAT, FOR EXAMPLE, WITH\nREPUBLICANS FOR HILLARY CLINTON. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT MICHELLE\nOBAMA AND HILLARY CLINTON ON THE STAGE TODAY AND YOU THINK ABOUT\nTHE NATION'S HISTORY FROM THE FIRST WOMEN'S RIGHTS CONVENTION\nIN SENECA FALLS IN 1848 TO WOMEN BEING ABLE TO GET THE RIGHT TO\nVOTE AND TO GET EQUAL CREDIT AND TO GET AN EQUAL PAY ACT, TO GET\nTHE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT, TO BLACK WOMEN FEELING SORT OF\nLOST IN THE CONVENTIONAL WOMEN'S RIGHTS MOVEMENT IN THE UNITED\nSTATES AND HAVING TO FORM THEIR OWN ORGANIZATIONS AND HERE WE\nHAVE TWO FIRST LADIES, AFRICAN-AMERICAN, WHITE, ONE\nRUNNING FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES, IT IS A\nHISTORIC MOMENT. I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT WOMEN DID\nNOT WATCH THIS SPEECH TODAY AND THINK TO THEMSELVES THAT THEY --\nTHAT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO BE A PART OF HISTORY\nLIKE THEY WERE WITH VOTING FOR BARACK OBAMA IN 2008.\n>> CHARLIE, MICHELLE OBAMA, I SAW HER GIVE -- DO AN EVENT IN\nNEVADA IN THE PRIMARY IN 2008 AND SHE WAS GREAT.\nSHE HAS ONLY -- YOU'VE BEEN COVERING POLITICS FOR A LONG\nTIME. LIKE SHE IS VERY, VERY, VERY\nGOOD AT THIS. >> YEAH.\nI THOUGHT SHE GAVE THE BEST SPEECH AT THE DEMOCRATIC\nNATIONAL CONVENTION BY A COUPLE OF LENGTHS.\nAND THAT WAS A PRETTY GOOD ROW OF SPEAKERS THERE, INCLUDING\nMOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE OUT THERE NOW OPERATING AS\nSURROGATES FOR THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN, WHO IF NOTHING ELSE --\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IF NOTHING ELSE HAS THE 1927 YANKEES OF\nSURROGATES, BECAUSE I SAW ELIZABETH WARREN THE DAY BEFORE\nAND SHE TORE IT UP. BUT I THINK, YOU KNOW, MICHELLE\nOBAMA, I DID NOT SEE HER THAT MUCH DURING THE 2008 CAMPAIGN.\nSHE'S BECOME A VERY GOOD PUBLIC SPEAKER AND A COMPLETELY\nDIFFERENT ONE FROM HER HUSBAND. WHICH I FIND FASCINATING.\nHE'S -- I MEAN HIS -- SHE'S A LITTLE BIT LESS POETIC AND A\nLITTLE BIT -- SHE'S A LITTLE BIT LESS JAZZ AND A LITTLE BIT MORE\nROCK 'N' ROLL THAN HE IS. I MEAN THE EMOTION IS VERY CLOSE\nTO THE SURFACE EVERY TIME SHE SPEAKS.\n>> I FOUND -- I FOUND HER TO BE ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE\nSURROGATES FOR EXACTLY THE REASON CHARLIE IDENTIFIES, JOY.\nFIRST OF ALL, SHE'S IN A UNIQUE POSITION, THE FIRST LADY ALWAYS\nDOES. GENERALLY THEY HAVE HIGH\nFAVORABILITY, THEY'RE SORT OUT OF THE DAILY THRUST OF POLITICS,\nBUT HER AS THE VOUCH -- AS THE PERSON VOUCHING FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON, THERE'S SOME -- WHAT IS IT ABOUT HER VOUCHING FOR HER\nTHAT HAS THE EFFECT IT DOES? >> WELL, MICHELLE OBAMA, FIRST\nOF ALL, IS A FIRST FOR A LOT OF REASONS.\nFIRST LADIES DON'T DO THIS. WHAT SHE'S DOING IS NOT EVEN\nWHAT ELEANOR ROOSEVELT DID. ELEANOR ROOSEVELT WAS PROBABLY\nTHE MOST ACTIVE FIRST LADY WE'VE HAD IN POLITICS UP UNTIL\nMICHELLE OBAMA. SHE DIDN'T DO IT IN 2008 FOR A\nLOT OF OTHER REACHES. BUT WHAT MICHELLE OBAMA DID IN\n2008 WAS TO TAKE HER MAGIC WAND AND TAP BARACK OBAMA FOR BLACK\nPEOPLE. I WAS DOING RADIO BACK THEN.\nA LOT OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS DIDN'T THINK HE WAS AUTHENTIC.\nNAME IS BARACK OBAMA. BLACK PEOPLE SEE PEOPLE WITH\nUNUSUAL NAMES BUT HE HAD EVERYTHING AGAINST HIM.\nNOT REALLY CHICAGO, REALLY HAWAII AND AN EXOTIC FIGURE AND\nI KNOW I WAS DOING A SHOW THAT HAD A MOSTLY BLACK AUDIENCE WHO\nWERE MORE FOR HILLARY THAN BARACK OBAMA.\nTHEN MICHELLE CAME ALONG, TAPPED HIM WITH HER MAGIC AND HE SEEMED\nINSTANTLY AUTHENTIC. SHE SEEMS LIKE YOUR COUSIN, SHE\nSEEMS LIKE SOMEONE YOU KNOW. SHE'S SO REAL.\nSHE'S TAKEN THAT MAGIC AND PUT THAT MAGIC ONTO HILLARY CLINTON.\nSHE CALLED HER MY GIRL. THAT WAS MAGIC FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON. >> THAT IS SUCH A GREAT POINT\nAND THAT HISTORY IS SO LOST IN MANY RESPECTS ABOUT WHAT\nHAPPENED IN 2008 AND PARTICULARLY IN THAT SOUTH\nCAROLINA PRIMARY AND GETTING THERE AND HER BEING ABLE TO SORT\nOF LAYING ON HANDS ROLE THAT SHE PLAYED THEN, REPRISING IT NOW\nFOR HILLARY CLINTON. >> ABSOLUTELY.\n>> MICHELLE BERNARD, JOY REID AND CHARLIE PIERCE, THANK YOU\nFOR STAYING WITH US ON A SOMEWHAT HECTIC NIGHT.\nI APPRECIATE IT. THAT IS \"ALL IN\" FOR THIS\nEVENING. \"THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW\" STARTS\nRIGHT NOW. BREAKING NEWS.\nWE HAD OBVIOUSLY NO NOTICE AND YOU DID GREAT WITH THAT.\n>> NOT TO BLOW UP OUR E-MAIL CORRESPONDENCE, BUT THANK YOU\nFOR YOUR ON-AIR FACT CHECKS AND FACT CONFIRMATION OF SOMETHING I\nSAID, WHICH I GREATLY APPRECIATED.\n>> YOU WERE WONDERING IF THERE HAD BEEN A PREVIOUS NEWS STORY\nABOUT MIKE PENCE'S POT.

I WILL ALSO REFRESH YOU ON THAT\nNEWS THAT CHRIS ALLUDED TO LAST HOUR, THAT THERE WAS SOME VERY\nUNUSUAL NEWS THAT WE REPORTED JUST ABOUT EXACTLY ONE MONTH AGO\nABOUT THE MAP WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN THE PILOT FOR MIKE PENCE'S\nCHARTER AIRCRAFT OVER THE COURSE",

THERE ARE ABOUT 30-PLUS FOLKS\nINSIDE. EVERYONE IS SAFE AND FINE.\nBUT A SCARY MOMENT. THE PLANE SKIDDED OFF THE\nRUNWAY. AN ALARM WAS PUT OUT.\nAS YOU CAN SEE, EMERGENCY PERSONNEL EVACUATING THE PLANE\nAS BOTH THE CAMPAIGN STAFF THAT TRAVEL WITH INDIANA GOVERNOR\nMIKE PENCE, AS WELL AS THE TRAVELING PRESS THAT COVERS HIM,\nINCLUDING SOME OF OUR OWN, WERE ON THAT PLANE WHEN IT HIT THE\nRUNWAY AND APPARENTLY SKIDDED OFF IN THE RAIN.\nWE ARE NOW AWAITING, HOPEFULLY, SOME MORE WORD, BUT AS OF NOW,\nIT SOUNDS LIKE EVERYONE WAS FINE AND BELIEVED THERE WERE NO\nACTUAL INJURIES DURING THAT EVENT.\nWE'RE HOPING TO GET A CONFIRMATION OF THAT.\nWE DO HAVE CONFIRMATION, AT LEAST EARLY CONFIRMATION, THAT\nNO ONE WAS HURT IN ANY SEVERE WAY.\nI DO NOT KNOW IF WE HAVE MADE CONTACT WITH THE GOVERNOR,\nHIMSELF. THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE,\nMIKE PENCE. OBVIOUSLY A LITTLE BIT OF A\nCHAOTIC SCENE ON THE RUNWAY IN LaGUARDIA ON THIS WINDY AND COLD\nAND STORMY NIGHT IN NEW YORK CITY.\nJEB HENSARLING, THE CONGRESSMAN FROM TEXAS, APPARENTLY TRAVELING\nON THAT PLANE ON THE HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE.\nWE BELIEVE THAT EVERYTHING IS FINE AND WE'RE GOING TO GET AND\nALL-CLEAR AND NBC PRODUCER VAUGHN HILLYARD WHO WAS ON THE\nPLANE IS WITH US. VAUGHN, WHAT HAPPENED?\n>> I'M WITH THE CAMPAIGN. >> JOHN, WHAT HAPPENED?\n>> HEY THERE. AM I LIVE, GUYS?\n>> YOU'RE LIVE. YOU'RE LIVE, BUDDY.\n>> OKAY. WE'RE ON THE TARMAC HERE AT\nLaGUARDIA. THE PLANE HAD A TOUGH LANDING.\nTHIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME THIS PLANE'S HAD A TOUGH LANDING.\nTHE FLIGHT WAS ACTUALLY DELAYED BY ABOUT TWO HOURS WHEN THE\nPLANE LANDED, WE WERE GOING THROUGH THE -- GOING THROUGH THE\nCLOUDS, HIT THE GROUND, AND AND WE STARTED TO SKID.\nYOU FELT SKIDDING. THE PLANE STARTED TO SWERVE TO\nTHE RIGHT AND THERE WAS SOME BUMPING THEN THE PLANE STOPPED.\nAS I SAID, THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME.\nTHIS IS THE TENTH CAMPAIGN PLANE, HE'S BEEN FLYING ON THIS\nPLANE FOR THREE-PLUS MONTH, SUSPECT THE FIRST TIME THE PLANE\nHAS HAD A ROUGHER LANDING. IT'S BECOME SORT OF A JOKE, GET\nREADY FOR THE LANDING. BUT OBVIOUSLY THE CONDITIONS\nWERE A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT HERE IN NEW YORK CITY TONIGHT.\nAND WE'RE GOING TO ZOOM IN, THAT IS KAREN PENCE, THAT I BELIEVE\nYOU'LL BE SEEING. I THINK WE'RE ON A LITTLE BIT OF\nA DELAY. THAT IS KAREN PENCE GETTING OFF\nTHE PLANE THERE. BUT THE PLANE SWERVED OFF AND WE\nNEED TO -- OKAY. WE NEED A SHOT OF THE GOVERNOR.\nSO WE'RE BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM THE SCENE HERE.\nYOU'RE GOING TO SEE THE GOVERNOR HERE IN A FEW MOMENTS.\nWE'RE BEING LED AWAY, BUT THE PLANE SLID OFF.\nEVERYBODY GOT UP. THERE WAS NO -- TO BE CLEAR,\nEVERYTHING FLEW AROUND AND FLEW FORWARD, BUT THE SITUATION WAS\nNOT IN WHICH ANYBODY WAS BEING THROWN AROUND.\nTHE GOVERNOR GOT UP QUICKLY AND HE WALKED -- AND HE WALKED BACK\nTO THE BACK OF THE PLANE. ACTUALLY WAS MAKING SURE THAT\nEVERYBODY WAS OKAY. AND EVEN KIND OF GAVE SOME FIST\nPUMPS IN THE AIR JUST AS EVERYBODY'S OKAY, EVERYBODY'S\nSAFE. HE'S MAKING SURE THAT EVERYBODY\nWAS OKAY. WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY REALIZE THAT\nWE WERE TOTALLY OFF OF THE RUNWAY WHEN THIS HAPPENED.\nBUT IT WASN'T UNTIL WE STARTED TO SEE THE LIGHTS, THE\nAMBULANCE -- OR THE FIRE TRUCKS ALL OUT THERE.\nYOU CAN SEE THE RESPONSE. WE'RE JUST KIND OF GOING WITH\nTHIS AT THIS POINT, YOU GUYS. >> YEAH.\n>> BUT THE GOVERNOR WAS OKAY. KAREN PENCE IS ON THE PLANE,\nKAREN PENCE THE FIRST LADY OF INDIANA, CHARLOTTE PENCE, THEIR\nOLDEST DAUGHTER WHO TRAVELS FREQUENTLY WITH THE CAMPAIGN.\nCAMPAIGN STAFF, THE SECRET SERVICE WHO TAKES UP TEN ROWS\nAND ABOUT EIGHT MEMBERS OF THE PRESS AND THEN THEY BROUGHT UP\nTHE STAIRS AND OBVIOUSLY WE JUST GOT OFF -- I THINK WE SAW\nEARLIER WHEN THE FEED STARTED COMING IN, YOU SAW MUD STREAKS\nAND WE ARE -- WE'RE BEING -- WE'RE -- SORRY.\nWE'RE BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM THE SCENE HERE.\n>> VAUGHN, IT'S BASICALLY -- CAN YOU TELL ME, OBVIOUSLY THE\nGOVERNOR AND HIS WIFE AND THEIR DAUGHTER, THEM, STAFF AND PRESS,\nIS THAT BASICALLY WHO'S ON THAT PLANE?\n>> YEP, THAT'S WHO'S ON THE PENCE PLANE.\nHE HAD A STOP -- HE WAS COMING FROM FT. DODGE, IOWA, LANDING\nFOR A FUND-RAISER WHICH WE'LL SEE WHETHER THAT HAPPENS.\nTHAT WAS GOING TO BE AT TRUMP TOWER THIS EVENING.\nTHE TRUMP, ACTUALLY, WE SENT VIDEO EARLIER OF THE GOVERNOR\nPLAYING FOOTBALL ON THE TARMAC BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER\nCONDITIONS. I'LL LET YOU HANDLE WHAT THE\nACTUAL WEATHER, WHAT THE SITUATION WAS, BUT WE ARE ABLE\nTO SEE HERE, I'M GOING TO GO OVER HERE TO THE RIGHT AND YOU\nCAN SEE HOW CLOSE WE ARE, AGAIN, I THINK THERE ARE VIDEOS ON\n20-SECOND DELAY HERE. BUT YOU'LL SEE HOW CLOSE TO THE\nROAD WE ARE OVER HERE ON THE RIGHT SIDE.\nAND LITERALLY INSIDE OF THE GRASS --\n>> WOW. >> I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS ARE\nSEEING THAT NOW. >> YEAH, WE CAN.\n>> AND YOU SEE ACTUALLY, I'M GOING TO ZOOM IN HERE TO WHERE\nTHE FENCE IS. YOU DON'T -- IT'S ACTUALLY\nPRETTY REMARKABLE. NOW, WE'RE JUST COMING TO GRIPS\nWITH KIND OF LOOKING AT THIS. HOW CLOSE WE WERE TO -- HOW\nCLOSE WE WERE TO THE ROAD. >> THAT PLANE IS PRETTY FAR OFF\nTHAT RUNWAY. >> YEAH.\nIT'S IN THE GRASS THERE WHICH I GUESS THE IMPACT OF THE PLANE\nCREATED MUD WHICH IS THE MUD MARKS THAT WE ARE ABLE TO SEE\nWHEN WE FIRST GOT OFF OF THE PLANE THERE, BUT EVERYBODY --\nI'M PRETTY SURE I'VE STILL GOT -- I STILL HAVE BAGS UP ON\nTHE PLANE. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT CAME AND\nSAID, PLEASE, EVERYBODY, JUST GET OFF THE PLANE NOW.\nWE WERE TRYING TO ESTABLISH A SHOT HERE.\nAGAIN, WE DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE HONESTLY WHAT HAPPENED RIGHT\nWHEN IT HAPPENED, BUT THE GOVERNOR GOT UP IMMEDIATELY,\nMADE SURE SECRET SERVICE, MADE SURE THE PRESS WAS OKAY.\nI THINK WE GOT THE SHOT. WE SEE HIM BACK OVER HERE.\nSORRY. IT'S A -- I MAY EVEN HAVE SOME\nRAINDROPS. >> VAUGHN, WHERE WERE YOU GUYS\nCOMING IN FROM? >> WE WERE COME IN FROM FT.\nDODGE, IOWA, WHERE WE HAD A CAMPAIGN EVENT.\nWE HAD ABOUT TWO, THREE-HOUR FLIGHT.\nSO WE'VE BEEN IN THE AIR FOR A LITTLE WHILE.\nWE KNEW THE STORM WAS IN HERE. IT WAS DELAYED FOR THE\nFUND-RAISER, WAS SUPPOSED TO START EARLIER THIS EVENING IN\nNEW YORK CITY. >> WERE THERE ANNOUNCEMENTS\nMADE, OBVIOUSLY YOU GUYS HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS HAPPENING, FELT\nTHE IMPACT, DIDN'T QUITE REALIZE THE SKID.\nDID ANYONE SAY ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING AS IT\nHAPPENED? >> ABSOLUTELY.\nAND, YOU KNOW, I'LL BE HONEST, I HAD MY PHONE OUT AND WAS\nRECORDING A FELLOW REPORTER WAS SLEEPING, AND BECAUSE IT'S NOT\nUN-NORMAL TO HAVE THESE HARD IMPACTS, WE WERE RECORDING IT.\nI LITERALLY TURNED IT OFF BECAUSE I THOUGHT WE WERE FINE.\nTHEN SUDDENLY WE SLID OFF. BUT EVERYTHING, PHONES, WATER\nBOTTLES, ABOUT TWO SECONDS AFTER THE LANDING, SUDDENLY EVERYTHING\nJUST SHOT FORWARD. MY SEAT BELT WASN'T FULLY\nTIGHTENED AND I FLEW FORWARD AND WAS OBVIOUSLY CAUGHT BY THE SEAT\nBELT, BUT YOU REALIZE PRETTY QUICKLY THAT AFTER SKIDDING\nTHERE -- THE PART WAS THAT IT TOOK THE SHARP RIGHT TURN AFTER\nABOUT MAYBE FOUR OR FIVE SECONDS, TOOK A SHARP RIGHT TURN\nAND THEN MAYBE THREE SECONDS LATER WE CAME TO A DEAD STOP.\nWHICH OBVIOUSLY THE PLANE WHEN YOU'RE ON THE TARMAC, YOU'RE ON\nFOR A LITTLE BIT OF WHILE THERE, AND -- AND, YEAH, SO YOU CAN SEE\nTHE GOVERNOR IS THERE RIGHT NOW. MR. PENCE, KAREN, FIRST LADY,\nWAS GETTING OFF THE PLANE. WE SAW CHARLOTTE PENCE EARLIER,\nTHEIR ELDEST DAUGHTER. HE'S TRAVELING WITH SEVERAL\nCAMPAIGN ADVISERS. YOU JUST SAW HIM GET SOME\nPHOTOGRAPHS WITH SOME OF THE NEAR DEPARTMENT HERE.\nAGAIN, TO BE CLEAR, THERE'S NO INJURIES.\nEVERYBODY WAS FINE, BUT AS WE ZOOM BACK OUT OVER, YOU'LL SEE\nHERE WHERE THE PLANE IS, COMPARED TO -- AND THE\nRESPONSE -- WE SAW THOSE LIGHTS IMMEDIATELY.\nAND I WAS ACTUALLY HEARING THAT THERE WAS ORIGINALLY REPORTS, WE\nWERE ON THE PLANE, SOMEBODY HAD SAID THAT THEY HEARD THERE WAS A\nREPORT THAT A PLANE HAD GONE OFF THE RUNWAY BUT NOT REALIZING\nTHAT THAT WAS THE PLANE THAT WE WERE ON.\nAGAIN, THIS IS THE PLANE THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS RIDING SINCE\nJULY. IT'S A 737.\nTHOSE OF US WHO RIDE ON THE PENCE PLANE LIKE TO THINK IT'S A\nNICE PLANE BUT I'M NOT SURE WHEN THIS GUY WILL BE GETTING BACK UP\nAND GOING AGAIN. WE'RE GOING TO FAST FORWARD\nHERE, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE MORE STAFF AND FIRE DEPARTMENT\nGETTING OFF THE PLANE. >> VAUGHN, YOU HAD SAID THAT YOU\nGUYS HAD SOME BUMPY LANDINGS ON THAT PLANE.\nAM I RECALLING CORRECTLY, THE CAPTAIN, THE MAN WHO HAD PILOTED\nTHE PENCE PLANE EARLY ON WAS REPLACED AT SOME POINT?\nIS THAT RIGHT? >> THAT IS -- YES.\nWE'VE ACTUALLY HAD SEVERAL PILOTS.\nI'M NOT SURE THE EXTENT. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO.\nI DON'T KNOW THE EXTENT. THERE'S PILOTS THAT ROTATE IN\nAND OUT THAT FLY THE 737, THE CAMPAIGN PLANE.\nI'M NOT SURE, TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST, WHO IS PILOTING THIS\nTIME AROUND. THE GOVERNOR DID SAY WHEN HE\nCAME BACK TO THE BACK OF THE PLANE, THEY WERE ABLE TO SEE\nINSIDE THE COCKPIT AND THERE WAS ACTUALLY MUD ON THE FRONT WINDOW\nWHICH WAS OUR FIRST INDICATION WE WERE, IN FACT, DEFINITELY OFF\nTHE RUNWAY BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR, HIMSELF, SAID THERE WAS MUD.\nI DON'T KNOW THE EXTENT TO THIS PILOT -- I DON'T WANT TO JUMP TO\nCONCLUSIONS. >> OF COURSE.\n>> THE PLANE -- THIS ISN'T -- OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A SPECIALIST,\nA COMMERCIAL AIRLINER. THIS IS NOT JUST A ONE-TIME\nTHING. IT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN THE PAST.\n>> WILL YOU JUST TELL ME RIGHT NOW, WE GOT SOME IMAGES OF FIRST\nRESPONDERS, I THINK OBVIOUSLY THERE'S POLICE, THERE'S FIREMEN,\nTHERE ARE SECRET SERVICE, OF COURSE.\nTHERE'S THE SECRET SERVICE STAFF THAT TRAVELS WITH THE GOVERNOR\nAT ALL TIMES. ABOUT HOW MANY FOLKS ARE IN THAT\nDETAIL? >> WITH THE SECRET SERVICE\nDETAIL, THERE'S PROBABLY ABOUT 15 OF THEM THAT ARE ON THE\nPLANE. AGAIN, AT THE FRONT OF THE\nPLANE, THERE ARE ABOUT FOUR -- THREE, FOUR ROWS -- YEAH, FOUR\nROWS IN WHICH CAMPAIGN STAFF INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR, MRS.\nPENCE AND CHARLOTTE PENCE, THEIR DAUGHTER, RIDE ON, AND THEN\nBEHIND THEM IS ABOUT EIGHT ROWS OF SECRET SERVICE AND THEN\nBEHIND THEM IS WHERE THE PRESS SITS.\nAND AS YOU SEE, I MEAN, THIS IS A -- IT LOOKS LIKE A PRETTY\nSTANDARD PLANE. TWO SEATS ON EACH SIDE OF THE\nROWS. AND, AGAIN, IMMEDIATELY THE\nGOVERNOR GOT UP, MADE SURE THAT EVERYBODY WAS OKAY.\nBUT, YEAH, NO, THIS WAS PROBABLY ABOUT 30, 40 PEOPLE THAT WERE ON\nTHE PLANE. >> AND THAT'S --\nAND SO IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT HUGE A STAFF THE GOVERNOR A\nTRAVELING WITH AT THIS POINT. >> NO, NO.\nTHE GOVERNOR IS TRAVELING -- SO THE GOVERNOR, MRS. PENCE,\nCHARLOTTE PENCE, ADVISER MARK SHORT, MICHAEL GLASSNER WHO WAS\nAN ORIGINAL FROM THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WAS ON THE PLANE TODAY.\nHE TYPICALLY DOES NOT TRAVEL WITH THE PENCE CAMPAIGN, BUT HIS\nLUCKY DAY. TODAY'S THE DAY THAT HE JUMPED\nON THE PLANE. AS WELL AS MARK SHORT AND\nMICHAEL GLASSNER, MIKE WATER, THE PRESS SECRETARY FOR THE\nGOVERNOR, YOU HAD JORDAN KAREM, THEIR TRAVEL DIRECTOR.\nBOBBY WHO IS THEIR TOUR LEAD. AND ZACH BAUER, SPECIAL ADVISER\nAND BODY MAN FOR THE GOVERNOR. THAT'S PRETTY MUCH HIS CORE --\nTHE CHAIR OF THE CAMPAIGN WAS NOT ON THE PLANE, BUT WE'RE 11\nDAYS OUT, HE WAS DOING A NEW YORK CITY FUND-RAISER TONIGHT\nTHEN HE WAS GOING TO BE LEAVING TOMORROW.\nHE'S ACTUALLY DOING -- HE'S ACTUALLY GOING TO BE ON, IF I\nMAY PROMOTE, HE'S GOING TO BE ON \"MORNING JOE\" TOMORROW AS WELL\nAS CNBC'S \"SQUAWK BOX.\" WE'LL BE HEARING MORE FROM HIM\nTOMORROW FOR SURE. POOR CONTINGENCY.\nYOU'RE SEEING THE AIRLINE ATTENDANTS THAT ARE THERE THAT\nARE GOING OUT HERE. HOLD ON ONE SECOND.\nI'M GOING TO TURN DOWN MY AUDIO. SORRY ABOUT THE -- WE'RE TRYING\nTO OPERATE THE CAMERA. >> VAUGHN, I'M GOING TO ACTUALLY\nLET YOU GO AND KEEP THAT CAMERA BECAUSE JUST SO FOLKS KNOW,\nVAUGHN RIGHT NOW IS MULTITASKING.\nHE'S OPERATING THE CAMERA, VISION THAT YOU'RE SEEING AS\nHE'S TALKING TO ME. >> YEAH.\n>> AT THE SAME TIME. I'M GOING TO LET YOU TRY TO\nMAYBE GET SOME MORE INFORMATION AND HOLD THAT -- THE POOL CAMERA\nTHERE. I'M GOING TO BRING IN NBC'S TOM\nCOSTELLO WHO I BELIEVE WE HAVE ON THE PHONE AT THIS MOMENT JUST\nTO GIVE A SENSE, OBVIOUSLY, THE DETAILS OF WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED\nHERE, WE ARE STILL TRYING TO TRACK DOWN.\nHOW OFTEN DOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS GENERALLY HAPPEN, TOM?\n>> WELL, LISTEN, HAVING A PLANE COMING IN, I'M WATCHING THE\nVIDEO COME IN AS WELL, YOU KNOW, THEY'VE CLEARLY GOT A VERY\nRAINY, DIFFICULT WEATHER NIGHT THERE IN NEW YORK.\nAND WHENEVER YOU'RE COMING IN ON A LANDING, AND KEEP IN MIND, A\n737 IS GOING TO COME IN SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF\n155 MILES PER HOUR OR SO, ASSUMING THIS IS A 737 300.\nAND LaGUARDIA ALREADY IS KNOWN AS A CHALLENGING AIRPORT.\nWHENEVER YOU COME IN FOR A LANDING BECAUSE IT'S RIGHT\nTHERE, AS YOU KNOW, SITTING RIGHT ON THE WATER.\nAND SO WHEN YOU ARE DEALING WITH COMING IN AT 155 MILES PER HOUR\nON A RAIN-SLICK RUNWAY, THESE THINGS CAN HAPPEN.\nYOU KNOW, WE GET REPORTS OF PLANES OFF THE END OF THE RUNWAY\nACROSS THE COUNTRY. I'D SAY PROBABLY ALMOST ONCE\nEVERY WEEK OR TWO. SOMEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY.\nAND IT HAPPENS SO OFTEN, YOU KNOW, WE JUST DON'T EVEN -- IT\nDOESN'T EVEN MAKE NEWS VERY OFTEN BECAUSE FOR THE MOST PART,\nTHEY SLIDE INTO THE MUD AND NOBODY IS INJURED AND YOU HAVE A\nLOT OF PEOPLE ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THIS HAPPENED.\nAND WHAT WILL HAPPEN NOW, OF COURSE, IS YOU'LL HAVE BOTH THE\nFAA AND PROBABLY THE NTSB, BUT SURELY THE FAA WILL TAKE A LOOK\nAT EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED IN THE COCKPIT, HOW FAST WAS THE PILOT\nCOMING IN, DID HE OR SHE HIT THAT RUNWAY EARLY ENOUGH?\nOR DID THEY HIT IT TOO LATE? AND AS A RESULT, DIDN'T HAVE\nENOUGH RUNWAY SPACE AT THE END? BUT THE CHANCES ARE --\n>> DID WE LOSE TOM THERE? SOUNDS LIKE WE MAY HAVE LOST TOM\nON THE AUDIO THERE. THAT'S LIVE FOOTAGE RIGHT NOW\nFROM THE RUNWAY, IF YOU'RE JUST JOINING US, LaGUARDIA AIRPORT,\nWHERE THE CHARTER PLANE, THE 737 THAT FLIES GOVERNOR OF INDIANA\nMIKE PENCE, OF COURSE, THE REPUBLICAN V.P., JUST SKIDDED\nOFF THE RUNWAY DURING A ROUGH LANDING.\nYOU CAN SEE THERE, THE PLANE UP IN THE UPPER LEFT HAND CORNER OF\nTHAT SCREEN, THAT GRASSY FIELD THERE IS WHERE THE PLANE ENDED\nUP STOPPING. NOT TOO FAR FROM THE FENCE THAT\nMARKS THE END OF THE AIRPORT. SO A PRETTY SCARY LANDING FOR\nTHE FOLKS, 30-PLUS THAT WERE ON THAT PLANE THAT INCLUDES THE\nGOVERNOR, HIS WIFE, THEIR DAUGHTER, CHARLOTTE, AS WELL AS\nABOUT 15 SECRET SERVICE AND ABOUT A DOZEN MEMBERS OF THE\nPRESS CORPS INCLUDING OUR OWN VAUGHN HILLYARD WHO AT THE\nMOMENT IS DIRECTING THAT CAMERA AMIDST THE SOMEWHAT CHAOTIC AND\nRAINY SCENE ON THE RUNWAY IN LaGUARDIA.\nLET ME BRING IN A.J. DELGADO, TRUMP CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER.\nWELL, VERY HAPPY EVERYONE'S OKAY.\n>> ABSOLUTELY. ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL, BUT\nCERTAINLY A SCARY SITUATION. I MEAN, THIS KIND OF MAKES YOU\nREALIZE HOW MUCH GOVERNOR PENCE AND ALL CANDIDATES REALLY PUT\nTHEMSELVES OUT THERE, INCLUDING EVEN THEIR SAFETY WITH THIS\nCONSTANT TRAVEL. IT'S A GRUELING SCHEDULE THAT\nTHEY ALL HAVE, INCLUDING EVEN SECRETARY CLINTON.\n>> YEAH. IT IS, THE AMOUNT OF TRAVEL THAT\nGOES ON TO A MODERN CAMPAIGN IS PRETTY REMARKABLE.\nGENERALLY, CAMPAIGNS HAVE, YOU KNOW, LARGE CHARTERED PLANES\nLIKE THIS ONE, A 737. THIS IS NOT AN ISLAND HOPPER OR\nSOMETHING LIKE THAT. THESE ARE SIGNIFICANT --\nSIGNIFICANT PIECES OF AIRCRAFT THAT THEY USE TO GET AROUND.\nTHAT'S A HUGE SORT OF ALMOST TRAVELING UNIVERSE.\nI'M SURE YOU'VE BEEN -- YOU'VE BEEN ON TRUMP FORCE ONE, OF\nCOURSE. >> YES.\n>> AND, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE IS THIS SORT OF WEIRD MOBILE\nVILLAGE THAT KIND OF GROWS UP AMIDST THE CAMPAIGN WITH\nEVERYONE FROM PEOPLE FROM ALL DIFFERENT VECTORS, CAMPAIGN\nSTAFF, THE CANDIDATE, SECRET SERVICE, PRESS, EVERYBODY SORT\nOF THROWN INTO VERY INTIMATE QUARTERS AND THEY SPEND A LOT OF\nTIME TOGETHER. >> RIGHT.\nIT'S A MOTLEY CREW KIND OF ENTOURAGE AND WITH STAKES THAT\nARE VERY HIGH. IT'S AN INTERESTING EXPERIENCE\nON THESE PLANES. ESPECIALLY TONIGHT.\nGLAD TO SEE EVERYBODY'S OKAY. >> VAUGHN HILLYARD HAS A LITTLE\nMORE INFORMATION. VAUGHN, YOU THERE?\n>> YES, I AM. >> SO WHAT'S GOING ON NOW?\n>> YEAH, SO OUR SHOT HERE, WE ARE THE MARINE -- WE'RE GETTING\nOUT OF THE -- WE'RE LEAVING THE MARINE AIR TERMINAL, SO THE\nMOTORCADE IS NOW LEAVING. MIKE PENCE IS NO LONGER GOING TO\nHIS FUND-RAISER. THE MOTORCADE HERE HAS TAKEN\nOFF, SO MIKE PENCE IS NO LONGER GOING TO THE FUND-RAISER.\nWE JUST TALKED TO MARK LAUDER, A SPOKESMAN, HE SAID, YES, THERE\nWERE NO INJURIES. HE SAID THAT PORT AUTHORITY IS\nLOOKING INTO IT. EVERYBODY WAS ON SCENE QUICKLY.\nNOW YOU'RE GOING TO GET A SHOT HERE IN WHICH THIS IS -- WE'RE\nNOW BEING TAKEN AWAY. I THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE\nFOLLOWING THE MOTORCADE HERE. ARE WE GOING TO BE FOLLOWING THE\nMOTORCADE? NO.\nSO MIKE PENCE, WE'RE NOT SURE EXACTLY NOW WHERE HE'S GOING.\nWE'LL WORK ON GETTING THAT INFORMATION.\nHE HAD ORIGINALLY, A FUND-RAISER FOR THIS EVENING PLANNED.\nTHEY SAID THEY ARE GOING TO RESCHEDULE THE FUND-RAISER.\nIT WAS GOING TO BE AT TRUMP TOWER.\nWE HAD A CAMERA THERE WAITING FOR THE GOVERNOR ONCE HE\nARRIVED, BUT HE'S NO LONGER GOING.\nI GUESS AFTER ALL OF THIS HAS TAKEN PLACE, THE CAMPAIGN SAYS\nTHAT THEY'LL RESCHEDULE IT. >> I THINK THAT PROBABLY MAKES\nSENSE. ALL RIGHT.\nVAUGHN HILLYARD WHO DID INCREDIBLE WORK TONIGHT.\nTHANK YOU, VAUGHN, FOR ALL OF THAT.\nI'M GLAD YOU'RE SAFE. I'M GLAD EVERYONE'S SAFE.\nLOOKS LIKE YOU ARE PULLING OUT OF THE AIRPORT THERE FROM WHAT I\nCAN TELL FROM THAT LIVE SHOT IN THE BACK OF THAT CAR.\nVAUGHN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A SHORT\nBREAK. WE'LL BE BACK WITH MUCH MORE.\nDON'T GO ANYWHERE.",

EARLIER, TRUMP CLAIMED MOMENTUM\nIN THE RACE SAYING POLLS SHOW HIM WITH LEADS IN BATTLEGROUND\nSTATES ACROSS THE ELECTORAL MAP. >> WE DON'T WANT TO TAKE IT FOR\nGRANTED, BUT WE ARE WINNING IN A LOT OF STATES.\nI HAVE TO SAY, THE MEDIA NOW, THEY'RE GOING WILD.\nTHE MEDIA'S GOING WILD BECAUSE THEY'RE SAYING, YOU KNOW, THIS\nGUY'S WINNING. IN FLORIDA.\nHE'S WINNING IN NORTH CAROLINA. HE'S WINNING IN IOWA.\nHE'S WINNING IN OHIO. >> THE MEDIA ISN'T QUITE SAYING\nTHAT. WELL, A RASH OF NEW POLLS\nSUGGEST THE RACE HAS TIGHTENED SLIGHTLY, IN RECENT DAYS HILLARY\nCLINTON CONTINUES TO HOLD THE LEAD OVER TRUMP NATIONALLY, AND\nA CLEAR LEAD IN ENOUGH BATTLEGROUND STATES AT THIS\nMOMENT TO PUT HER OVER THE TOP. ADJUSTED NATIONAL POLLING\nAVERAGE, NATE SILVER'S 538, SHOWS CLINTON WITH A SIX-POINT\nLEAD OVER TRUMP OVERALL. ADJUSTED STATE POLLING AVERAGES\nSLOW CLINTON WITH LEADS IN ALL FOUR OF THE STATES TRUMP\nMENTIONED ALTHOUGH THE RACE IS EFFECTIVELY A DEAD HEAT TIED IN\nIOWA AND OHIO. CRUCIALLY IN PENNSYLVANIA, A\nSTATE TRUMP DESPERATELY NEEDS TO WIN, HE'S DOWN MORE THAN 6 1/2\nPOINTS IN 538'S ADJUSTED POLLING AVERAGE.\nTHE RACE IS TIED IN ARIZONA, A STATE THAT SHOULD BE A LAY-UP\nFOR A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE.\nREFUSING TO ADMIT PUBLICLY HE'S DOWN, TRUMP IS SUGGESTING\nCLINTON'S POLICIES ARE SO BAD, MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE AN\nELECTION. >> THINKING TO MYSELF RIGHT NOW,\nWE SHOULD JUST CANCEL THE ELECTION AND JUST GIVE IT TO\nTRUMP, RIGHT? WHAT ARE WE HAVING IT FOR?\n>> IN CASE IT WASN'T CLEAR FROM THE CONTEXT, THAT WAS A JOKE.\nTHE CANDIDATE DAYDREAMS OF THAT, HIS STUFF STAFF IS GRAPPLING\nWITH THE PICTURE THEY FACE IN THE REAL WORLD.\nBLOCKBUSTER NEW PIECE IN \"BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEK,\" IT'S\nREPORTED THAT TRUMP'S SAN ANTONIO RESEARCH TEAM SPENDS\n$100,000 A WEEK ON SURVEYS AND SOPHISTICATED MODELS THAT RUN\nDAILY SIMULATIONS OF THE ELECTION.\nAS A RESULT, TRUMP'S STAFF KNOWS HE'S LOSING BADLY.\n\"NATE SILVER'S RESULTS HAVE BEEN SIMILAR TO OURS\" SAYS TRUMP\nPOLITICAL DIRECTOR \"EXCEPT THEY LACK BY A WEEK OR TWO.\"\nUSING TARGETED FACEBOOK POSTS AND OTHER MEANS.\nIDEALISTIC WHITE LIBERALS, YOUNG WOMEN AND AFRICAN-AMERICANS.\nSENIOR OFFICIAL IN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN DESCRIBED THIS EFFORT\nBY TELLING \"BLOOMBERG,\" \"WE HAVE THREE MAJOR VOTER SUPPRESSION\nOPERATIONS UNDER WAY.\" WHAT HE SEEMS TO BE TALKING\nABOUT IS NEGATIVE CAMPAIGNING TO DEPRESS TURNOUT, NOT WHAT IS\nCOMMONLY CALLED VOTER SUPPRESSION.\nWITH CLINTON BY HER SIDE IN NORTH CAROLINA TODAY, MICHELLE\nOBAMA LAMBASTED THE TRUMP CAMP'S EFFORT TO DEPRESS TURNOUT WHICH\nSHE SAID INCLUDED TRUMP'S CLAIMS THE ELECTION IS RIGGED.\n>> IF HILLARY DOESN'T WIN THIS ELECTION, THAT WILL BE ON US.\nIT WILL BE BECAUSE WE DID NOT STAND WITH HER.\nIT WILL BE BECAUSE WE DID NOT VOTE FOR HER.\nAND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HER OPPONENT IS HOPING WILL HAPPEN.\nTHAT'S THE STRATEGY. TO MAKE THIS ELECTION SO DIRTY\nAND UGLY THAT WE DON'T WANT ANY PART OF IT.\n>> IF TRUMP DOES LOSE THIS ELECTION, DON'T EXPECT HIM TO GO\nAWAY QUIETLY. \"BLOOMBERG\" REPORTS BY ELECTION\nDAY TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN EXPECTS TO HAVE GOTTEN E-MAIL ADDRESSES,\nSMALL DONORS PONIED UP $275 MILLION.\nCOULD BECOME THE AUDIENCE FOR A NEW MEDIA VENTURE OR BACKBONE\nFOR A THIRD PARTY POLITICAL MOVEMENT AND FORCE THE GOP TO\nCONFORM TO TRUMPISM INSTEAD OF MOVING AWAY FROM A CANDIDATE WHO\nLOST. IN THE WORDS OF TRUMP'S DIGITAL\nDIRECTOR, \"WE OWN THE FUTURE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\"\nJOINING ME NOW, CO-AUTHOR OF THAT PIECE, \"BLOOMBERG\nBUSINESSWEEK'S\" JOSH GREEN. TO SOME EXTENT, I THINK THE\nSTORY ABOUT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS THEY'RE BASICALLY WINGING IT\nAND THIS WAS A WINDOW INTO THE FACT THAT THEY MAY BE WINGING IT\nIN CERTAIN WAYS BUT THERE IS ALSO AN ACTUAL ORGANIZATION\nTHERE DOING SOME OF THE STUFF THAT CAMPAIGNS TYPICALLY DO.\n>> YEAH, I MEAN, THAT WAS A REAL TAKEAWAY TO ME.\nI THINK THE REASON THEY COOPERATED WITH THIS PIECE WAS\nTHAT THEY WERE LITTLE MIFFED AT THE IDEA THAT THEIR CAMPAIGN IS\nREALLY NO MORE THAN TRUMP AND HIS TWITTER FEED AND THEY HAVE,\nIN FACT, BUILT A PRETTY AMBITIOUS DATA OPERATION DOWN IN\nSAN ANTONIO, THEY CO-NAMED IT PROJECT ALAMO, AND THEY\nBASICALLY SHOWED OFF ALL THE BELLS AND WHISTLES WHICH WHILE\nIT MAY NOT RESEMBLE A TRADITIONAL CAMPAIGN, HAS TURNED\nINTO A REAL MONSTER SMALL-DOLLAR FUND-RAISING MACHINE, WHICH IS\nALLOWING TRUMP TO BUILD UP THIS REALLY VALUABLE THIS, THIS\nAUDIENCE OF DONORS THAT CONCEIVABLY CAN BE TRANSPORTED\nOVER TO TRUMP TV NETWORK OR SOME NEW SOCIAL MEDIA PLAY, IF HE\nDOESN'T WIN THE ELECTION, OR IF HE DOES WIN THE ELECTION, HE'S\nGOT A BIG LIST OF SUPPORTERS BACKING HIM UP.\n>> YEAH, THERE'S A NUMBER OF BERNIE SANDERS, EX-SANDERS\nFUND-RAISING AND DIGITAL TEAM FOLKS THAT ARE KNOW OR FOLLOW ON\nTWITTER AND THEY HAVE BASICALLY LOOKED AT THIS OPERATION BEING\nBUILT IN REALTIME AND THEY BUILT AN INCREDIBLE OPERATION,\nOBVIOUSLY. IT'S WHAT SORT OF POWERED THAT\nCAMPAIGN IN CERTAIN WAYS, AND THEY SAY THE METRICS THAT\nTHEY'VE HIT IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF DONORS THEY HAVE, THE\nAMOUNT OF MONEY THEY'RE ABLE TO BRING IN, IS REALLY REMARKABLE\nIN THE SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THEY CONSTRUCTED IT.\n>> IT REALLY IS REMARKABLE WHAT THEY'VE DONE, AND I THINK THE\nMOST INTERESTING GUY IN THE WHOLE STORY IS THIS GUY, BRAD\nPARSCALE, HE WE PROFILE, ESSENTIALLY ONE OF THE MOST\nPOWERFUL PEOPLE IN THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION.\nCRAZY STORY. HE USED TO BUILD WEBSITES FOR\nTRUMP'S REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES AND THE TRUMP WINERY.\nTRUMP TRUSTS HIM. HE LIKES HIM.\nHE GETS A LOT DONE. EVENTUALLY AS VARIOUS MEMBERS OF\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, COREY LEWANDOWSKI, PAUL MANAFORT GOT\nFIRED, LEFT, PARSCALE GOT MORE AND MORE AUTHORITY AND BUILT\nTHIS MACHINE THROWING OFF ALL THESE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO THE\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN. >> IT'S ALSO INTERESTING HE SAID\nTO YOU, YEAH, OUR NUMBERS ARE THE SAME AS NATE SILVER'S WITH A\nTWO-WEEK LAG. THAT WAS A SORT OF AMAZING\nMOMENT OF HONESTY AND CLARITY. >> WELL, THEY HAVE BUILT\nSOPHISTICATED DATA MODELS. I MEAN, THEY HIRED THE CAMBRIDGE\nANALYTICS, THEY SPENT MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS DOING\nTHIS STUFF. THEY HAVEN'T REALLY SAID THIS TO\nTHE PRESS, SO I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY IT'S SO\nSURPRISING, BUT LOOK, IF YOU PUT GOOD SCIENTISTS IN A ROOM AND\nYOU USE GOOD POLLS AND CRUNCH THE NUMBERS RIGHT, YOU'RE GOING\nTO COME OUT WITH I WOULD ASSUME A MORE OR LESS ACCURATE PICTURE\nOF THE ELECTION. >> RIGHT.\n>> AND THE NUMBERS THEY SHOWED US DID NOT DIFFER DRAMATICALLY\nFROM THE KIND OF NUMBERS YOU SEE FROM GOOD PUBLIC FORECASTERS\nLIKE NATE SILVER. THE ONLY POINT THAT THE TRUMP\nPEOPLE MADE WAS, LOOK, WE'RE OUT THERE EVERY NIGHT MAKING\nTHOUSANDS OF CALLS IN ALL THESE BATTLEGROUND STATES.\n>> RIGHT. >> WE SEE SEE THIS HAPPENING IN\nREALTIME. >> YES.\n>> A LOT OF THESE PUBLIC GUYS HAVE A TWO-WEEK LAG.\n>> EVERYBODY WHO WORKS INSIDE CAMPAIGNS THINK PUBLIC POLLS ARE\nINCREDIBLY PASSE BECAUSE THEY GET THE DATA EVERY NIGHT IN REAL\nTIME. JOSH GREEN, THANKS FOR YOUR\nTIME. >> THANK YOU.\n>> I WANT TO CHECK IN WITH NBC'S HALLIE JACKSON WHERE TRUMP IS\nABOUT TO TAKE THE STAGE. I UNDERSTAND TRUMP CALLED\nGOVERNOR PENCE TO CHECK IN AND MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WAS OKAY.\n>> Reporter: THAT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING, CHRIS.\nHE WAS IN THE MOTORCADE, HE LANDED IN CLEVELAND BASICALLY AT\nONE OF THE AIRPORTS IN THE CITY, LIKE A 50-MINUTE DRIVE TO\nGENEVA, OHIO, WHERE WE ARE NOW. AT SOME POINT ON THAT MOTORCADE\nWE ARE TOLD BY A SPOKESPERSON THAT DONALD TRUMP CALLED\nGOVERNOR PENCE TO CHECK IN TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE WAS OKAY.\nSAID HE WAS OBVIOUSLY HAPPY THAT EVERYBODY WAS SAFE.\nSO THAT IS SORT OF WHAT YOU MIGHT EXPECT FROM THE TOP OF THE\nTICKET WITH THE RUNNING MATE WHEN AN INCIDENT LIKE THIS\nHAPPENS. AN INCIDENT THAT OBVIOUSLY IS\nNOW CREATING A RIPPLE EFFECT FOR TRAVELERS.\nFRANKLY, POTENTIALLY INCLUDING US, TRUMP TYPICALLY WOULD LAND\nBACK AT THE FBO AT LaGUARDIA AIRPORT AFTER HIS RALLIES AND\nTHAT IS WHERE WE WERE SET TO HEAD TONIGHT.\nSO WE'LL SEE HOW THAT UNFOLDS. HE IS ABOUT TO TAKE THE STAGE IF\nI'M LISTENING BEHIND ME CORRECTLY.\nI THINK HIS MUSIC IS ABOUT TO BEGIN.\nI WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF HE MENTIONED WHAT HAPPENS AT THE\nTOP OF HIS REMARKS, CHRIS. THAT'S SOMETHING TO SEE.\nDONALD TRUMP WALKS ON THE STAGE RIGHT NOW.\nCHRIS? >> ALL RIGHT.\nJOINING ME NOW -- CONSERVATIVE COLUMNIST, A.J.\nDELGADO, SENIOR ADVISER TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE THERE.\nI'M GLAD EVERYBODY IS OKAY. AT LaGUARDIA.\nRICK, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS QUOTE, \"WE OWN THE FUTURE OF THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY\"? >> LOOK, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY\nSOLD ITSELF LOCK, STOCK AND BARREL TO DONALD TRUMP SO THEY\nDO IN A WAY. IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE\nTRUMP DEMOGRAPHIC OWNING THE FUTURE, IT'S NOT A VERY LONG\nFUTURE SINCE THEY'RE ABOUT 65 YEARS OLD MEDIAN.\nSO I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT THEY COMPLETELY CONTROL THE FUTURE.\nI THINK WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE IS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AT THE\nEND OF THIS, IF TRUMP CRASHES AND BURNS AS IT LOOKS LIKE HE\nWILL, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS GOING TO -- A FACTION OF IT WILL\nSPLIT OFF AND SAY, WE NEEDED MORE TRUMP, MORE PEPPY THE FROG,\nMORE WHITE SUPREMACY. THERE'S A FRACTION THAT'S GOING\nTO SAY DONALD WHO, WHAT? THEY'RE GOING TO PRETEND HE\nNEVER EXISTED AND HOPE THEY CAN JUST SKATE OUT OF IT.\nI THINK THERE'S A GROWING NUMBER OF CONSERVATIVES WHO ARE\nFOLLOWING FOLKS LIKE EVAN McMULLIN WHO ARE LOOKING AT A\nFUTURE WHERE A CONSERVATIVE CENTER RIGHT THIRD PARTY THAT\nGETS RID OF THE LEGACY CODE AND THE NEGATIVE STUFF THAT HAS\nACCRUED AROUND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, MOVES FORWARD INTO THE\nFUTURE. I THINK YOU'RE LOOKING AT A\nREPUBLICAN PARTY CRACKUP IN A LOT OF THESE SCENARIOS.\n>> ALL RIGHT. DONALD TRUMP TAKING THE PODIUM\nRIGHT NOW. LET'S TAKE A LISTEN FOR A\nSECOND. >> AND YOU'VE GOT THOUSANDS AND\nTHOUSANDS OF PEOPLE STANDING OUTSIDE TRYING TO GET IN.\nIT'S AMAZING. IT'S AMAZING.\nAND YOU KNOW, WHEN I CAME OVER, I WAS JUST WATCHING THE\nTELEVISION, I WATCHED ONE OF THE COMMENTATORS SAY THAT WE HAVE A\nFEW THOUSAND PEOPLE HERE.",

HERE TO DISCUSS IS ALAN\nDERSHOWITZ, AND A GUY FOR UNAROUSED VOTERS.\nMICHAEL ISAKOFF, AND DOUGLAS BLINKLY, THE AUTHOR OF RIGHTFUL\nHERITAGE. GOOD EVENING.\nMR. DERSHOWITZ, I'LL START WITH YOU.\nHILLARY CLINTON NEVER MENTIONED THIS CLINTON INC. MEMO.\nDID THE CLINTONS DO ANYTHING ILLEGAL IN WHAT WE JUST SAW?\n>> NO, THEY'VE DONE NOTHING ILLEGAL.\nTHERE'S NO EVIDENCE SHE MADE ANY SINGLE DECISION AS SECRETARY OF\nSTATE BASED ON CONTRIBUTIONS, BUT I THINK THEY HAVE TO LOOK TO\nTHE FUTURE. IF I WERE HILLARY CLINTON I\nWOULD SAY, IF ELECTED PRESIDENT MY HUSBAND WILL NOT ACCEPT A\nSINGLE PENNY FOR SPEAKING FEES DURING THE FOUR OR EIGHT YEARS\nI'M PRESIDENT. THE CLINTON FOUNDATION WILL BE\nPUT IN THE HANDS OF VERY OBJECTIVE, WORLD-CLASS, NOBEL\nPRIZE WINNING WHATEVER, AND WE WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.\nI THINK IF SHE SAYS ANYTHING, SHE SHOULD LOOK TO THE FUTURE\nAND ASSURE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC WHATEVER HAPPENED IN THE PAST IS\nNO PROBLEM IN THE FUTURE. >> SHE NEEDS TO TALK, NOT BE\nQUIET ON THE ISSUE? >> I THINK SHE SHOULD TALK ABOUT\nONLY ABOUT THE FUTURE. >> OF COURSE, DONALD TRUMP IS\nUSING IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY, AS HE SHOULD, RIGHT, AS HER\nOPPONENT? >> OF COURSE.\n>> HE WAS QUICK TO PILE ON TODAY.\nLOOK AT THIS. >> JUST TODAY WE READ ABOUT\nCLINTON CONFIDANTE DOUG BRAND BRAGGING HE FUNNELED TENS OF\nMILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO BILL CLINTON INC. THROUGH THE\nFOUNDATION DONATIONS, PAID SPEECHES AND CONSULTING\nCONTRACTS. MR. BAND CALLED THE ARRANGEMENT\nUNORTHODOX. THE REST OF US CALL IT OUTRIGHT\nCORRUPT. IF THE CLINTONS WERE WILLING TO\nPLAY THIS FAST AND LOOSE WITH THEIR ENTERPRISE WHEN THEY\nWEREN'T IN THE WHITE HOUSE, JUST IMAGINE WHAT THEY'LL DO GIVEN\nTHE CHANCE TO ONCE AGAIN CONTROL THE OVAL OFFICE.\n>> OUTRIGHT CORRUPT, ALAN. IS THAT ACCURATE?\nARE THE PRACTICES CORRUPT? >> NO, I THINK THEY'RE UNSEEMLY\nAND I THINK THEY CREATE AN APPEARANCE THAT THE AMERICAN\nPUBLIC IS ENTITLED TO LOOK AT. BUT COMING FROM DONALD TRUMP,\nMAKING THESE ARGUMENTS? LOOK AT HIS HISTORY.\nIF HE WOULD BRING TO THE WHITE HOUSE THE WAY HE HAS CONDUCTED\nBUSINESS THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER, IT WOULD BE FAR, FAR WORSE THAN\nANYTHING HE ALLEGES. SO ONE ALWAYS HAS TO MAKE\nCOMPARATIVE JUDGMENTS. >> MICHAEL, SO THIS MEMO\nDESCRIBES HOW BILL CLINTON AIDE DOUG BRAND, YOU HEARD DONALD\nTRUMP MENTION DOUG BRAND THERE, HOW HE HELPED -- EXCUSE ME, DOUG\nBAND, HOW HE HELPED RUN CLINTON INC., PULLING IN LUCRATIVE DEALS\nIN WHAT HE CALLS, THIS IS A QUOTE, IN-KIND SERVICES FOR THE\nPRESIDENT AND HIS FAMILY FOR PERSONAL TRAVEL, HOSPITALITY,\nVACATION AND THE LIKE. IS THAT STANDARD PRACTICE,\nIN-KIND SERVICES? >> WHAT WAS GOING ON HERE WAS\nSUSTAINING A LIFESTYLE THAT BILL CLINTON HAD BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO\nOF FLYING AROUND THE WORLD, COLLECTING LARGE SUMS OF MONEY\nFOR TALKS AND SPEECHES, STAYING AT FIVE STAR HOTELS, AND, YEAH,\nIT IS UNSEEMLY. YOU KNOW, THE GAP BETWEEN THE\nRHETORIC THAT HILLARY CLINTON AND DEMOCRATS HAVE USED ABOUT\nTHE PROBLEM OF MONEY AND POLITICS, OF UNDUE INFLUENCE FOR\nSPECIAL INTERESTS AND WEALTHY DONORS, AND THEN THE REALITY OF\nSPECIAL INTERESTS AND WEALTHY DONORS POURING THIS KIND OF\nMONEY INTO THE FAMILY FOUNDATION, INTO THE POCKET OF\nTHE CLINTON FAMILY THROUGH THESE SUMS PAID TO BILL CLINTON IS --\nIS PRETTY LARGE. I THINK THAT'S -- YOU KNOW,\nTHAT'S WHERE THIS IS AN ISSUE AND IS A PROBLEM.\nIT HAS BEEN FOR THE CLINTONS FOR A LONG TIME.\nTHE GAP BETWEEN THE HIGH-MINDED RHETORIC THAT THEY ESPOUSE AND\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS CERTAINLY ESPOUSED AND THE REALITY OF\nTHESE KINDS OF SUMS PAID TO THEM.\nAND I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT MUCH OF THIS TOOK PLACE WHILE HILLARY\nCLINTON WAS SECRETARY OF STATE, IN WHICH MANY OF THESE\nCOMPANIES, FOR INSTANCE, UBS HAD INTERESTS BEFORE THE GOVERNMENT.\nUBS WAS BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.\nIT REQUIRED OVER -- HELPING ITS CUSTOMERS EVADE TAXES IN THE\nUNITED STATES. IT REQUIRES AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN\nTHE STATE DEPARTMENT AND THE SWISS GOVERNMENT IN ORDER FOR\nTHE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO GET SOME OF THOSE RECORDS.\nYOU KNOW, WHEN THEY TALK NOW ABOUT -- YOU KNOW, AND ALAN\nTALKED ABOUT THE FUTURE. THIS WAS -- YOU KNOW, THESE WERE\nISSUES WHILE SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE.\n>> OKAY. I WANT TO GET DOUGLAS IN.\nDOUGLAS, HOW MUCH DAMAGE DO THESE HACKED MEMOS DO TO THE\nCLINTONS? THEY SEEM TO REINFORCE MANY OF\nTHE CONCERNS VOTERS HAVE ABOUT THEM.\n>> WELL, IT DOES SOME DAMAGE, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE A DOCUMENT\nDUMP, AN ILLEGAL ONE -- MEANING WIKILEAKS -- ABOUT PEOPLE\nHACKING THIS AND DUMPING IT RIGHT BEFORE THE ELECTION, I\nTHINK THE WIKILEAKS PEOPLE ARE RUSSIA, THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AN\nOCTOBER SURPRISE, BUT WITH NO SMOKING GUN IT HAS A TAINT.\nIT PUTS A TAINT ON THE CLINTONS, BUT THINGS ARE RUNNING FAST.\nWE HAVE 11 DAYS. THE NEWS CYCLE IS MOVING, AND\nTHIS LITTLE -- THESE INTERNAL E-MAILS JUST AREN'T HAVING THE\nWALLOP I THINK THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WOULD HAVE HOPED.\nIT DOESN'T HELP A ALL RIGHT OF VOTERS HAVE BEEN HEARING ABOUT\nHILARY CLINTON'S E-MAILS AND SERVERS AND WIKILEAKS FOR A YEAR\nNOW AND THEY'RE TIRED OF IT. I DON'T THINK ANY ONE OF THESE\nIS REALLY THAT DAMNING. BU I AGREE WITH WHAT ALAN SAID,\nKEY POINT, DON. I THINK BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON\nIF SHE IS ELECTED PRESIDENT HAVE TO DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION. MAYBE ONLY SEND A HOLIDAY\nGREETING CARD AND THAT'S ABOUT IT BECAUSE THIS IS A CREEPING\nPROBLEM IF THEY CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEIR OWN FOUNDATION WHEN\nTHEY'RE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. >> WE HAVE LOTS MORE TO DISCUSS.\nGENTLEMEN, DON'T GO ANYWHERE. UP NEXT, IF HILLARY CLINTON IS\nELECTED WILL HER HONEYMOON WITH CONGRESS BE OVER BEFORE IT\nBEGINS? \u00e2\u0099\u00aa",

SHE JUST CAN'T SAY NO TO THIS\n[BLEEP]. WHY DIDN'T THEY GET THIS STUFF\nOUT LIKE 18 MONTHS AGO? IT IS SO CRAZY.\nTANDEN ADDED, I GUESS I KNOW THE ANSWER.\nTHEY WANTED TO GET AWAY WITH IT.\nI LOVE TANDEN. WHILE TEAM HILLARY WAS\nPUBLICLY FREAKING OUT THEY PUBLICLY DOWNPLAYED THE\nPRIVATE E-MAIL STORY.

THEY SAID IN PRIVATE WHAT ALL\nOF US WERE SAYING IN PUBLIC AND THE CAMPAIGN WAS PUBLICLY\nDENIED. >> IS TRUMP TALKING ABOUT\nTHIS? I DIDN'T HEAR HIM GIVE A PRESS\nCONFERENCE. THESE SCANDALS NEED ATTENTION.\nWHAT DO THEY HAVE TO DO TO GET THE ATTENTION?\n>> I I THINK I JUST FELL ASLEEP WITH MY EYES OPEN.\n>> ARE YOU BOARD BY THIS? >> I MEAN, IT IS JUST THE SAME\nTHINGS OVER AND OVER. THE ASSOCIATED PRESS DID A\nSTORY THIS MORNING AND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW THIS\nELECTION HAS -- TWO STUDIES SHOW THAT THIS ELECTION HAS\nHAD THE LEAST AMOUNT OF POLICY COVERAGE OF ANY ELECTION THAT\nSOME OF OF THESE GROUPS THAT LOOK AT COVERAGE FROM NETWORKS\nHAVE STUDIED. IT IS SINCE LIKE 1988.\nSO IT IS THE E-MAILS AND IT IS LIKE THE GROUPING AND IT IS\nTHE ONE THING OR THE OTHER. I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR MORE\nABOUT POLICIES. >> IF CLINTON IS ELECTED,\nBRENDAN, ARE THEY GOING TO COME AFTER HER THEN?\nARE THEY GOING TO DO HER JOB AND THEY WILL WAIT TO GET INTO\nTHE OFFICE? >> IMPORTANT RULE, NEVER TRUST\nA GRANDMA WITH E-MAIL. MY GRANDMA IS STILL SENDING ME\nINVITES TO CHRISTIAN MINGLE. DON'T LET A GRANDMA HAVE AN\nE-MAIL. THAT'S AN IMPORTANT LESSON.\n>> WHY DON'T YOU OPEN THE E-MAILS?E%\nTHERE ARE NICE FEMALES ON THERE.\n>> HE IS A CATHOLIC. ARE THEY ALLOWED ON THERE?\n>> YEAH. >> YOU CAN DATE ANYONE YOU\nWANT. >> JUST SELECT FIVE E-MAILS.\nTAKE THE FIVE TOP. >> I DON'T THINK I DID.\n>> I READ YOU NICE E-MAILS. >> I JUST WANT FIVE E-MAILS.\nGIVE ME THE GREATEST HITS.

AND HILLARY CLINTON, WHO\nUSED TO CALL IT HILLARY CARE WHEN SHE WAS PITCHING BIG\nHEALTHCARE REFORMS BACK IN THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION,\nSHOULD BE XED OUT OF THE COMPETITION BECAUSE OF IT IS\nHE GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT LATE HERE.\nALSO WORTH NOTING THAT THE SIZE OF THE VENUES OF\nTRUMP'S CROWDS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERABLY SMALLER.\nTHIS PLACE IS GOING TO HAVE SEVERAL THOUSAND PEOPLE IN\nIT.

IN 12 DAYS HE RECOGNIZES\nOHIO HAS GOT TO BE A BIG SHOWING.\n>> OKAY, CARL, THANKS VERY MUCH.\nIN THE BATTLEGROUND STATE IN NORTH CAROLINA MICHELLE\nOBAMA JOINED HILLARY CLINTON FOR THE FIRST TIME ON THE\nCAMPAIGN TRAIL. FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT\nJENNIFER GRIFFIN IS LIVE IN WINSTON, SALEM, SOUTH\nCAROLINA WHERE BOTH MEN -- EXCUSE ME, BOTH WOMEN SPOKE\nEARLIER TODAY. JENNIFER, HELLO.\n>> HI, BRIT. WELL, THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN\nCALLS NORTH CAROLINA THE CHECK MATE STATE.\nTHEY BELIEVE THAT IF THEY CAN WIN THE STATE'S 15\nELECTORAL VOTES THAT THEY CAN STOP DONALD TRUMP.\nTHAT IS WHY THEY CALLED IN ONE OF THE DEMOCRATIC\nPARTY'S TOP SUR GATS WHO HAS THE HIGHEST RATINGS IN THE\nPARTY. THEY ARE CALLING HER THEIR\nSECRET WEAPON TO MAKE THE CLOSING ARGUMENT AS TO WHY\nHILLARY CLINTON SHOULD BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT.\n>> SHE HAS MORE EXPERIENCE AND EXPOSURE TO THE\nPRESIDENCY THAN ANY CANDIDATE IN OUR LIFETIME.\nYES, MORE THAN BARACK, MORE THAN BILL, SO, SHE IS\nABSOLUTELY READY TO BE COMMANDER IN CHIEF ON DAY\nONE AND, YES, SHE HAPPENS TO BE A WOMAN.\n[CHEERS] >> MICHELLE OBAMA AND\nHILLARY CLINTON WERE NOT ALWAYS CLOSE.\nAFTER THE HARD FOUGHT 2008 CAMPAIGN, WITH THE NASTY\nRHETORIC FROM THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE, DONALD TRUMP'S\nQUESTIONING WHERE BARACK OBAMA WAS BORN AND HIS\nCONTROVERSIAL STATEMENTS ABOUT WOMEN HAVE MADE THEM\nALLIES. >> AND IF PEOPLE WONDER,\nYES, HILLARY CLINTON IS MY FRIEND.\nSHE HAS BEEN A FRIEND TO ME AND BARACK AND MALIYAH AND\nSASHA. >> EVERY ELECTION IS ABOUT\nTHE FUTURE. AND THIS ONE IS ABOUT\nWHETHER WE BUILD ON THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE THE\nLEGACY THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS BUILT, OR RIP IT AWAY\nAND GO BACKWARDS. >> CLINTON STOPPED BY AN\nEARLY VOTING STATION HERE IN NORTH CAROLINA AFTER LEAVING\nTHE RALLY. HER LARGEST YET.\nIN PERSON EARLY VOTING IN NORTH CAROLINA STARTED LAST\nMONDAY. THE CAMPAIGN SAYS 881,000\nVOTES HAVE ALREADY BEEN CAST.\nAND LATINOS HAVE R. VOTING AT A RATE 44% HIGHER THAN IN\n2012. CLINTON ALSO STOPPED BY\nHISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGE JUST A LITTLE WHILE AGO,\nNORTH CAROLINA AT&T IN GREENSBORO WHERE ABOUT 2,000\nSTUDENTS WERE CELEBRATING HOMECOMING.\nEARLIER TODAY, MICHELLE OBAMA REMINDED PEOPLE JUST\nHOW CLOSE THE ELECTION IN NORTH CAROLINA WAS IN 2008.\n>> BARACK WON NORTH CAROLINA BY ABOUT 14,000 VOTES.\nWHICH SOUNDS LIKE A LOT. BUT WHEN YOU BREAK THAT\nNUMBER DOWN, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WINNING AND LOSING\nTHIS STATE WAS A LITTLE OVER 2 VOTES PER PRECINCT.\nEACH OF YOU COULD SWING AN ENTIRE PRECINCT AND WIN THIS\nELECTION FOR HILLARY. >> PRESIDENT OBAMA LOST\nNORTH CAROLINA IN 2012. EVEN THOUGH THE DEMOCRATS\nHELD THEIR CONVENTION HERE. RIGHT NOW, THE POLLS SHOW A\nDEAD HEAT HERE IN NORTH CAROLINA.\nBACK TO YOU, BRIT. >> OKAY.\nJENNIFER, THANKS VERY MUCH.

WHAT JASON MILLER SAID WAS, THE\nPERSON WHO TOLD THAT TO BUSINESS WEEK WAS NOT AUTHORIZED TO SAY\nIT. SO LET'S BE CLEAR, NOBODY IS\nPUSHING BACK ON THE STORY OR REFUTING ANYTHING WE'RE\nREPORTING. THEY'RE SAYING GEE, UNFORTUNATE\nCHOICE OF WORDS. I THINK IT WAS AN UNFORTUNATE\nCHOICE OF WORDS. VOTER SUPPRESSION IS A LOADED\nTERM. WHAT THEY'RE DOING MORE IS LIKE\nDISSUADING, PEOPLE, IF THEY SHOWED UP AT THE POLLS, WOULD BE\nLIKELY TO VOTE FOR HILLARY CLINTON, BUT CERTAINLY AREN'T\nGOING TO DO THAT UNLESS THEY'RE EITHER DRIVEN OUT BY THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN OR CONVINCED TO GO TO VOTE.\nBUT THEY COULD ALSO POSSIBLY WITH A BIT OF NEGATIVE\nINFORMATION BE CONVINCED TO NOT GO VOTE.\nTHAT IS THE TYPE OF VOTER THAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS TRYING TO\nDISSUADE. THEY THINK IF THEY CAN DRIVE OUT\nTHEIR OWN VOTE AND KEEP HILLARY'S VOTE DOWN, THERE IS A\nPATH TO VICTORY. I TALKED TO A TRUMP CAMPAIGN\nOFFICIAL TODAY WHO SAID OUR PATH IS TOUGH BUT DOABLE.\n>> ROBERT COSTA, BENJAMIN CRAMER USED TO TALK ABOUT THE EMOTIONAL\nMOMENT WHERE SOMEONE WENT TO THE CANDIDATE, USUALLY ON A PLANE,\nUSUALLY EXHAUSTED, SOMETIMES A COUPLE DAYS OUT, SOMETIMES ON\nTHE EVE OF THE ELECTION, AND HAD THE TALK AND SAID, IT'S NOT\nGOING TO HAPPEN, BOSS, IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.\nDO YOU GET THE FEELING IT'S BEEN A KIND OF A SLOW MOTION CAR\nACCIDENT IN EFFECT IN THIS CAMPAIGN, IF THE FINDING OF\nJOSH'S ARTICLE, AMONG OTHER FINDINGS, IS CORRECT?\n>> IF ONLY RICHARD BEN CRAMER WAS AROUND TO WRITE ABOUT THIS\nELECTION. I THINK FOR TRUMP WHAT IT TAKES\nRIGHT NOW, BRIAN, IS A VERY NARROW PATH.\nAND JOSH'S ARTICLE IS SPOT-ON, BECAUSE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN\nBELIEVES IF THE OBAMA COALITION IS ABLE TO BE REASSEMBLED BY\nSECRETARY CLINTON IN PLACES LIKE PENNSYLVANIA, IT BECOMES NEARLY\nIMPOSSIBLE FOR DONALD TRUMP TO WIN.\nSO HE NEEDS SOME OF THOSE CORE OBAMA VOTERS TO STAY HOME.\nAT THE SAME TIME, FOR WHITE WORKING CLASS VOTERS IN THE RUST\nBELT TO COME OUT IN RECORD NUMBERS FOR DONALD TRUMP.\n>> JOSH, NOT TO TAKE YOU TO A CONCLUSION YOU DON'T ARRIVE AT,\nBUT WHAT -- ASSUMING THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS NOT VICTORIOUS, WHAT\nHAS IT ALL BEEN ABOUT? WHAT DOES THE VIBE IN SAN\nANTONIO TELL YOU ABOUT THE UNDERCURRENT, THE DRIVING\nMECHANICS HERE? >> I MEAN, THE VIBE QUITE\nFRANKLY WAS DETERMINATION AND EXCITEMENT.\nI'VE BEEN IN CAMPAIGNS WHERE IT IS CLEAR THAT A LOSS IS COMING,\nAND THAT IS NOT THE FEELING AT ALL IN TRUMP DIGITAL\nHEADQUARTERS IN SAN ANTONIO. BUT I THINK AS WE SAY IN THIS\nPIECE, THEY'RE LOOKING PAST THE ELECTION, WHETHER THEY WIN OR\nNOT. AND WHAT TRUMP HAS BUILT HERE IN\nTHIS SAN ANTONIO OPERATION, WHICH IS IMPRESSIVE, IS THIS\nLARGE AUDIENCE OF PEOPLE WHOSE NAMES AND E-MAIL ADDRESSES AND\nIN SOME CASES, CREDIT CARD NUMBERS, HE OWNS.\nSO THIS IS AN AUDIENCE THAT COULD CONCEIVABLY BE TRANSPORTED\nTO A TRUMP SOCIAL MEDIA NETWORK OR SOME OTHER PLATFORM DONALD\nTRUMP COULD TAKE AND WORK FROM, IF HE WANTS TO CONTINUE ON IN\nPOLITICS AND IN MEDIA. AND ALL THE INDICATIONS I GOT\nFROM PEOPLE AROUND TRUMP IS HE IS NOT GOING TO WALK AWAY IF HE\nLOSES THE ELECTION. HE WANTS TO CONTINUE TO EXERT\nHIS INFLUENCE ON AMERICAN POLITICS.\n>> I WANT TO GIVE VOICE TO YOUR NODDING.\n>> I THINK WE'VE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT WHAT THESE FINAL WEEKS ARE\nLIKE FOR HIM. HE DOES NOT HAVE A PATH TO 270.\nSTEVE KORNACKI LAID OUT CLEARLY, HIS BEST CASE SCENARIO IS TO A\nMAXIMUM OF 265. BUT HE ALSO SAID IN HIS OWN\nWORDS AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS CAMPAIGN, IT WILL HAVE ALL BEEN\nFOR NAUGHT IF HE LOSES. WE KNOW ABOUT THE TAPES THAT\nWERE TURNED OVER TO \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" THAT SAVING FACE IS\nESSENTIAL TO WHO HE IS. A SAVING FACE WAY OUT WOULD BE\nTO DO EXACTLY WHAT IS DESCRIBED IN THIS PIECE, TO TURN IT INTO\nSOMETHING BIGGER, TO TURN IT INTO A NEW AND MORE WORTHY\nMISSION, AND IN HIS EYES, A BUSINESS VENTURE IS PROBABLY\nSOMETHING THAT HE CAN EASILY AND AUTHENTICALLY SPIN INTO A MORE\nNOBLE MISSION. >> ROBERT COSTA, I'VE ASKED YOU\nTHIS BEFORE, BUT LIKE OUR COVERAGE OF THE LAST HURRICANE\nTHAT RAN UP THE COAST OF FLORIDA, ARE WE SEEING A\nTIGHTENING AT THE CORE IN TRUMP LAND?\n>> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS EVIDENT IS THE INFLUENCE OF\nSTEVE BANNON. THIS IS A CANDIDATE WHO REMAINS\nMOSTLY ISOLATED FROM THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\nAND THAT HAS CONSEQUENCES MOVING FORWARD.\nHE DOESN'T FEEL A DEEP AFFILIATION WITH THE GOP.\nHE'S A POPULIST, A NATIONALIST, AN INCENDIARY OUTSIDER.\n>> JOSH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING ON TONIGHT.\nLET'S JUST THINK WHAT RICHARD BEN CRAMER COULD DO\nMETAPHORICALLY WITH A PLANE OFF THE RUNWAY VIS-A-VIE THIS\nCAMPAIGN.

TO CAMPAIGN WITH HILLARY\nCLINTON, SHE PRAISED HILLARY CLINTON AND MADE A CASE FOR\nAMERICAN GREATNESS. >> SHE HAS MORE EXPERIENCE AND\nEXPOSURE TO THE PRESIDENCY THAN ANY CANDIDATE IN OUR LIFETIME.\nYES, MORE THAN BARACK, MORE THAN BILL.\nSHE IS ABSOLUTELY READY TO BE COMMANDER IN CHIEF ON DAY ONE.\nAND YES, SHE HAPPENS TO BE A WOMAN.\nWE WANT A PRESIDENT WHO TAKES THIS JOB SERIOUSLY.\nAND HAS THE TEMPERAMENT AND MATURITY TO DO IT WELL.\nBECAUSE WE WANT TO GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT KNOWING THAT OUR KIDS\nAND OUR COUNTRY ARE SAFE. IT'S A COUNTRY WHERE A GIRL LIKE\nME FROM THE SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO, WHOSE GREAT, GREAT\nGRANDFATHER WAS A SLAVE, CAN GO TO THE FINEST UNIVERSITIES ON\nEARTH. A COUNTRY WHERE THE DAUGHTER OF\nAN ORPHAN CAN BREAK THAT HIGHEST AND HARDEST GLASS CEILING AND\nBECOME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\n>> TALK ABOUT POLITICAL ABILITY. I'VE NEVER SEEN IT QUITE AS GOOD\nAS THE FIRST LADY. EARLIER IN THE WEEK, NEWT\nGINGRICH WENT TO WAR WITH FOX NEWS'S MEGYN KELLY.\nHE WAS THEN CONGRATULATED FOR HIS PERFORMANCE BY DONALD TRUMP.\nLET'S WATCH THAT PERFORMANCE. >> IF TRUMP IS A SEXUAL\nPREDATOR, THAT IS -- >> HE'S NOT A SEXUAL PREDATOR --\n>> OKAY, THAT'S YOUR OPINION. >> YOU CAN NOT DEFEND THAT\nSTATEMENT! I'M SICK AND TIRED OF PEOPLE\nLIKE YOU USING LANGUAGE THAT'S INFLAMMATORY THAT'S NOT TRUE.\nCAN WE GO BACK TO THE TAPES OF YOUR SHOW, RECENTLY.\nYOU ARE FASCINATED WITH SEX AND YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT PUBLIC\nPOLICY. >> ME?\nREALLY? >> THAT'S WHAT I GET OUT OF\nWATCHING YOU TONIGHT. >> CONGRATULATIONS, NEWT, ON\nLAST NIGHT. THAT WAS AN AMAZING INTERVIEW.\nWE DON'T PLAY GAMES, RIGHT? WE DON'T PLAY GAMES.\n>> OH, YEAH? THAT WAS THE LATEST EXAMPLE OF A\nCAMPAIGN THAT SOME REPUBLICANS SAY IS DRIVING AWAY WOMEN FROM\nTHE PARTY. DON'T JUST LIMIT IT TO WOMEN,\nANYWAY. ACCORDING TO THE \"WASHINGTON\nPOST\" TODAY, A GROWING NUMBER OF PROMINENT REPUBLICAN WOMEN ARE\nWORRIED THAT AS MEMBERS OF THEIR MALE-DOMINATED PARTY STEP UP TO\nDEFEND DONALD TRUMP AGAINST ACCUSATIONS FROM SEXUAL ASSAULT,\nTHEY ARE CAUSING A IRREPARABLE DAMAGE TO THE GOP'S\nDETERIORATING RELATIONSHIP WITH FEMALE VOTERS.\nIRONICALLY, CONTINUING WITH THE POST, IRONICALLY, IT IS TRUMP'S\nCANDIDACY RATHER THAN HILLARY CLINTON'S THAT HAS BROUGHT\nSEXISM TO THE FOREFRONT OF POLITICAL DEBATE.\nKATIE PACKER, SHE WAS ON THE SHOW RECENTLY, THE DEPUTY\nMANAGING CAMPAIGN MANAGER FOR MITT ROMNEY'S 2012 CAMPAIGN TOLD\n\"THE WASHINGTON POST,\" QUOTE, FOR NEXT-GENERATION PROFESSIONAL\nWOMEN, THE PARTY'S GOING TO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING VERY, VERY\nDRASTIC TO CHANGE THE COURSE OF WHERE THIS CANDIDATE HAS TAKEN\nUS. WELL, HOW MUCH DAMAGE IS IT?\nWE'VE WATCHED A LOT OF THIS AND SHOWN YOU THE EXHIBITS ON BOTH\nSIDES. JOINING ME RIGHT NOW, MICHAEL\nSTEELE, THE FORMER CHAIR OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE.\nHE'S AN MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST. AUTHOR RON REAGAN, ALSO AN MSNBC\nPOLITICAL ANALYST. AND MOLLY BALL, STAFF WRITER FOR\nTHE ATLANTIC. MOLLY, I WANT TO DEFER TO THE\nFORMER CHAIR OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY FIRST.\nI KNOW IT'S A WOMEN'S ISSUE, BUT I'VE GOT TO ASK MICHAEL.\nTHIS IS THE CRAZIEST, CRAZIEST JUXTAPOSITION.\nTHERE YOU HAVE THE MOST DASH -- YOU'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL HOW YOU\nSAY THINGS, BEAUTIFUL FIRST LADY, ATTRACTIVE, DYNAMITE\nSPEAKER, INCREDIBLY POLISHED, IVY LEAGUER IN EVERY POSSIBLE\nGOOD SENSE OF THAT WORD, CHARMING, PERSUASIVE, A ROLE\nMODEL FOR EVERYONE, MALE AND FEMALE, OF EVERY BACKGROUND.\nAND THEN YOU HAVE NEWT GINGRICH DUKING IT OUT IN THIS SIDE SHOW\nALONG THE GANGWAY OF SOME CIRCUS THAT THEY'RE RUNNING AGAINST\nMEGYN KELLY, WHO IS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR CONSERVATIVE\nANCHORS WE'VE EVER SEEN. WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOUR AT\nLEAST CURRENT OR ERSTWHILE POLITICAL PARTY, AT LEAST?\nI DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU STAND. WHY ARE THEY SUCH FOOLS?\n>> THIS IS A PARTY THAT IS ACTUALLY OUTSIDE OF ITSELF RIGHT\nNOW. IT HAS NO ORIENTING MOORINGS.\nIT'S NOT MOORED TO ANY IDEA OR ANY PARTICULAR LEADER IN THE\nSENSE THAT YOU HAVE THE CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP THAT'S\nGOING IN ONE DIRECTION, THE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP GOING IN\nANOTHER. AND YOU HAVE THE NOMINEE OF THE\nPARTY THAT HAS REALLY NOT LAID OUT A DIRECTION.\nSO YOU HAVE THIS MOMENT, THIS QUINTESSENTIAL MOMENT, WHERE ALL\nTHE WORK THAT THE PARTY HAS PUT IN OVER THE YEARS TO CAPTIVATE\nTHE IMAGINATIONS OF WOMEN, AFRICAN-AMERICANS, HISPANICS,\nALL OF THAT'S FOR NAUGHT. AND IT'S ALL BEING LOST, NOT IN\nA MATTER OF YEARS, BUT IN A MATTER OF WEEKS.\nIN THE LAST FEW WEEKS, THIS SORT OF DUMBING DOWN OF THE POLITICAL\nPROCESS BY PARTY LEADERS AND OTHERS, HAS JUST BEEN STUNNING.\nAND THE WOMEN OF THE PARTY, IN THIS HOUR SAYING, ENOUGH.\nAND MY VIEW, IT'S ABOUT TIME. I WANT MORE OF THOSE VOICES TO\nCOME OUT TO SEND THE CLARION CALL THAT THIS PARTY IS GOING TO\nREQUIRE DIFFERENT LEADERSHIP AND A DIFFERENT DIRECTION AFTER THIS\nELECTION. >> MOLLY, I HAVE A PLAN FOR YOU\nTO GET INTO THE FRONT PAGES OF THE NEWSPAPER, WHETHER YOU WANT\nIT OR NOT. JUST GET WITHIN FOUR FEET OF\nDONALD TRUMP. DID YOU SEE DANA BASH THE OTHER\nDAY? HE CALLED HER INSULTING BECAUSE\nSHE ASKED HIM ABOUT WHY HE WAS TAKING TIME FROM THE CAMPAIGN TO\nGO OPEN UP A HOTEL. IT WAS A FAIR QUESTION.\nOF COURSE, IT WAS A LITTLE BIT PROVOCATIVE, BUT THAT'S THE IDEA\nOF THESE QUESTIONS, YOU PROVOKE THE CANDIDATE.\nAND HE WAS PROVOKED. ANYWAY, YOUR THOUGHTS?\n>> LOOK, I DON'T SPEAK FOR ALL WOMEN, OBVIOUSLY, BUT THE WOMEN\nWHO ARE PRONOUNCING THEMSELVES DIVORCED FROM THE REPUBLICAN\nPARTY, PROMINENT WOMEN, WOMEN WHO ARE REPUBLICAN POLITICAL\nPROFESSIONALS, THEY'RE NOT DOING THIS BECAUSE THEY DISAGREE WITH\nREPUBLICAN POSITIONS. THEY WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE THERE\nTO BE A CONSERVATIVE PARTY THAT WOMEN CAN BE A PART OF.\nA PARTY THAT IS PRO-LIFE, A PARTY FOR SMALL GOVERNMENT.\nTHEY ARE NOT BECOMING LIBERALS, RIGHT?\nIF THEY'RE VOTING FOR THE DEMOCRAT, IT'S BECAUSE THEY FEEL\nTHEY'VE BEEN FORCED TO BY, AS CHAIRMAN STEEL WAS SAYING, A\nREPUBLICAN PARTY THAT HAS SIGNALED IT DOESN'T WANT TO\nRESPECT WOMEN AS HUMAN BEINGS. SO IT'S A TOUGH DECISION FOR A\nLOT OF THESE WOMEN AND I THINK THERE IS POTENTIALLY LONG-TERM\nDAMAGE WITHOUT NEW LEADERSHIP. THAT BEING SAID, I THINK THERE\nARE A LOT OF CONSERVATIVE WOMEN OUT THERE WHO WOULD RESPOND VERY\nPOSITIVELY TO FUTURE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE WHO WAS ABLE TO MAKE\nMORE POLITE OVERTURES. >> WHAT HAPPENED TO THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY THAT LOOKED UP, AND I MEAN, REALLY LOOKED UP TO\nMARGARET THATCHER? BIG-TIME.\nSHE WAS THE ROLE MODEL FOR WHAT A CONSERVATIVE WOMAN WOULD BE.\nAND NOW IT'S THE PARTY THAT -- I DON'T WANT TO SAY.\nIT JUST GETS YOU IN TROUBLE SAYING WHAT YOU THINK.\nLET ME GO TO RON ON THIS, WHO HAS SOME EXPERIENCE.\nYOUR FATHER'S BEST FRIEND IN POLITICS WAS THIS VERY STRONG\nLEADER, LEADER OF MEN AND WOMEN, NOT SOMEBODY TO BE TREATED THE\nWAY ANYBODY SHOULD BE TREATED, BUT NOW YOU SEE THESE SIDE\nFIGHTS. I MEAN, WHY IS NEWT GINGRICH\nFIGHTING WITH MEGYN KELLY? JUST MOVE ON!\nDUST IT OFF. SAY SOMETHING.\n>> WELL, LET ME MAKE ONE POINT, FIRST.\nAND THAT IS, THAT WE TEND TO CHARACTERIZE THESE ISSUES OF\nSEXUAL HARASSMENT AND SEXUAL ASSAULT, IN THIS CASE, AS\nWOMEN'S ISSUES. THEY'RE NOT WOMEN'S ISSUES.\nIF ANYTHING, THEY'RE MEN'S ISSUES.\nMEN ARE THE ONES, GENERALLY SPEAKING, DOING THESE -- THE\nHARASSING AND THE ASSAULTING. BUT THEY'RE HUMAN ISSUES.\nNOW, AS FAR AS NEWT GINGRICH GOES, REALLY, COULD YOU ASK FOR\nA WORSE PERSON TO BE DISCUSSING ISSUES LIKE THIS?\nTHIS GUY'S BEEN MARRIED THREE TIMES, CHEATED ON HIS FIRST TWO\nWIVES, TOLD UP WITH OF HIS WIVES SHE HAD A CHOICE, A DIVORCE OR\nAN OPEN MARRIAGE, WAS IMPEACHING BILL CLINTON FOR HAVING A\nCONSENSUAL AFFAIR WHILE HAVING AN AFFAIR HIMSELF.\nAND REALLY, WORSE THAN THAT, REALLY, CONFLATES THE TWO ISSUES\nOF SEXUAL HARASSMENT, SEXUAL ASSAULT, AND SEX, WHICH IS A\nMISTAKE YOU SEE REPUBLICANS MAKING ALL THE TIME WHEN THEY\nDISCUSS THIS. THIS, TO THEM, IS SOMEHOW SEX,\nWHEN YOU GRAB A WOMAN'S GENITALS AGAINST HER WILL, YOU'RE HAVING\nSEX, AS FAR AS NEWT IS CONCERNED.\n>> WE'RE GETTING INTO THAT WORLD NOW, THAT MR. TRUMP HAS DRAGGED\nUS INTO. ANYWAY, TRUMP'S COMMENTS ABOUT\nWOMEN HAS CAUSED TROUBLE THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN.\nHE'S ATTACKED HILLARY CLINTON'S LOOK AND HER STAMINA, WHICH I'VE\nNEVER HEARD THAT GONE AFTER. GONE AFTER THE WEIGHT OF A\nBEAUTY QUEEN, MOCKED THE LOOKS OF WOMEN WHO HAVE ACCUSED HIM OF\nMISCONDUCT. AND ATTACKED FEMALE JOURNALISTS,\nASKING HIM QUESTIONS. AS I SAID.\nLET'S LOOK AT A LITTLE RUN-THROUGH HERE.\nA LITTLE REMINDER.",

IN THAT SAME O'REILLY INTERVIEW\nDONALD TRUMP TALKED ABOUT THE IDEA THAT IT'S NOT JUST THAT HE\nIS TALKING ABOUT THE VOTER RIGGING, THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED.\nHE BLAMED IT AGAIN ON THE MEDIA. THE LAST FEW DAYS HE HAS\nSPECIFYING HE IS MAKING A BROADER CRITIQUE ABOUT THE WHOLE\nSYSTEM. THE POINT IS, ONE, THIS IS NO\nEVIDENCE. TWO, WE HAVE BEEN AT THIS A YEAR\nAND A HALF. VOTERS HAVE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT\nOF INFORMATION ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON TO\nALLOW THEMSELVES TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION IN THIS CASE.\nWE AT THE WASHINGTON POST, CNN, OTHER OUTLETS DO THIS VERY\nDILIGENTLY EVERY DAY.

THE MIKEIO PHONE WAS NOT\nSUPPOSED TO BE ON. NOT THAT I MAKE THAT EXCUSE FOR\nMYSELF. IT WAS AN ILLEGAL ACT, NBC.\n>> YOU THINK IT WAS ILLEGAL PUTTING THAT TAPE OUT.\n>> ABSOLUTELY. THAT WAS A PRIVATE DRESSING\nROOM. >> ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE ACTION\nAFTER THE ELECTION AGAINST NBC. >> YOU WILL SEE.\nYOU ARE GOING TO SEE AFTER THE ELECTION.\nBUT I WILL -- I WILL TELL YOU, FIRST OF ALL, SHOULDN'T HAVE\nBEEN SAID.

WHEN DONALD TRUMP IS ATTACKING\nHILLARY CLINTON ABOUT WIKILEAKS, WHEN HE IS TALKING ABOUT HOW HE\nIS GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, WHEN HE TALKED WITH OBAMA\nCARE, TRADE DEFICITS, HE DOES BETTER.\nWHEN HE IS TALKING ABOUT THE ACCESS HOLLYWOOD, WHICH HE COULD\nGET AWAY WITH NOT ADDRESSING IN SUCH DETAIL THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR\nHIM. >> TRUMP HAS BEEN TRYING TO\nREACH OUT TO AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS TRYING TO EXPAND HIS\nAPPEAL. I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO DONALD\nTRUMP IN A RALLY IN OHIO TALKING ABOUT THE INNER CITY.\n>> WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON OUR GHETTOS SO THAT YOU TAKE A LOOK\nAT WHAT'S GOING ON WHERE YOU HAVE POCKETS OF AREAS OF LAND\nWHERE YOU HAVE THE INNER CITIES AND YOU HAVE SO MANY THINGS, SO\nMANY PROBLEMS, SO MANY HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE PROBLEMS.\nTHE VIOLENCE, THE DEATHS, THE LACK OF EDUCATION, NO JOBS.\nWE'RE GOING TO WORK WITH THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, AND\nWE'RE GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF THE INNER CITY.\nWE'RE GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM.\n>> DAVID WHY -- WHY DOES HE CONTINUE TO DO THIS?\nAND WHY AREN'T HIS ADVISORS EDUCATING HIM?\nCOULD THEY NOT KNOW BETTER AS WELL?\nWHAT'S GOING ON HERE? >> THREE PROBLEMS, DON.\nONE IS THAT TO THE EXTENT DONALD TRUMP IS OUTREACHING TO\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VITAERS IT'S TOO LITTLE TOO LATE.\nIN OUR NEW WASHINGTON POST POLL, HILLARY CLINTON IS PLUS 81\nPOINTS AMONG BLACK VOTERS. HE IS NOT GOING TO CATCH UP A\nWEEK AND A HALF OUT. ANOTHER PROBLEM IS THE LANGUAGE\nHE USES. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO COME AFTER\nME ON TWITTER SAYING THIS IS BEING POLITICALLY CORRECT.\nPART OF BEING ABLE TO TALK TO A SLICE OF THE ELECTORATE IS TO BE\nABLE TO SORT OF USE THEIR LANGUAGE.\nPEOPLE DON'T USE THE WORD GHETTO ANYMORE THIS THIS CONTEXT.\nJUST LIKE YOU DON'T USE THE WORD NEGRO OR ARIENTAL ANYMORE.\nIT IS NOT A MATTER OF POLITICAL CORRECTNESS.\nIT'S A MATTER OF BEING POLITE AND RESPECTFUL AND UNDERSTANDING\nWHERE THE DISCUSSION HAS DONE. LASTLY IT'S THAT ON POLICY,\nRIGHT? HE GAVE A SPEECH YESTERDAY WHERE\nHE TALKED ABOUT HIS NEW DEAL FOR BLACK AMERICA WHICH I DON'T\nTHINK FULLY RESONATES WITH THE BLACK ELECTORATE BUT AT LEAST\nWAS AN EARNEST ATTEMPT. BUT THEN HE UNDERWOULD UP\nSTEPPING ON THAT MESSAGE TODAY AND BEING ALL OVER THE PLACE AND\nNOT DRIVING THE POINT HOME. AS MARK SAID HE HAS A TOUGH TIME\nSTAYING ON MESSAGE. IN TERMS OF HIS ADVISORS, I\nCOULDN'T HAZARD A GUESS. THIS IS A BROADER PROBLEM FOR\nREPUBLICANS AT LARGE NOT JUST THE DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN.\n>> GHETTOS WAS JUST -- I -- >> YEAH.\n>> YEAH.

NOW THE TRUTH IS, HILLARY\nCLINTON IS DOMINATING DONALD TRUMP IN MOST PROJECTIONS BY\nSUCH A LARGE MARGIN THAT THE RACE ISN'T CLOSE RIGHT NOW.\nBUT I GO CAN HAPPEN IN THIS KIND OF RACE IN THE NEXT TEN DAYS.\nAND WE'LL SEE HOW IT DEVELOPS. BUT WE ARE GOING TO BE READY TO\nBLOCK THEM BOTH IF THE RACE IS TIGHT.\nREGARDLESS, THOUGH, WE ARE BUILDING A NEW CONSERVATIVE\nMOVEMENT THAT IS OPEN THE ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF\nTHEIR RACE OR RELIGION. WE BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT IN\nTHIS RACE TO STAND FOR EQUALITY AND TO STAND FOR THE CAUSE OF\nLIBERTY. WE DON'T SEE EITHER DONALD TRUMP\nOR HILLARY CLINTON DOING THAT IN THE WAY WE THINK IT NEEDS TO BE\nDONE, OR AT ALL, SO WE ARE STANDING FOR THAT AND BUILDING\nSOMETHING NEW WHICH WE THINK IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO PROVIDE\nTHE KIND OF LEADERSHIP THAT THIS COUNTRY NEEDS.\n>> OKAY. SO YOU SAID YOU WANT TO BLOCK\nBOTH OF THEM. AND YOU TAKE IT TO THE HOUSE OF\nREPRESENTATIVES. I'M WONDERING, DO YOU AGREE WITH\nDONALD TRUMP? DO YOU THINK IT IS A RIGGED\nSYSTEM? DO YOU THINK THAT CHANGES NEED\nTO BE MADE TO THE SYSTEM? >> I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGGED\nSYSTEM. IF THERE IS ANY RIGGING OF THE\nSYSTEM AT ALL IT'S BEING DONE BY VLADIMIR PUTIN HACKING OUR\nCOMPUTER SYSTEMS AND USING OTHER MEANS TO INFLUENCE AND UNDERMINE\nTHE U.S. ELECTION PROCESS. NO.\nBUT OTHERWISE I DON'T AGREE THAT IT'S RIGGED.\nI THINK I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE SYSTEM, THE PROCESS OPENED UP A\nBIT. I THINK GIVEN THAT WE HAVE FROM\nTHE MAJOR PARTIES BOTH HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP, TWO\nCANDIDATES WHO ARE SO HUGELY UNPOPULAR, AND I BELIEVE UNFIT\nFOR THE RESPONSIBILITIES THEY SEEK -- I DO THINK WE NEED NEW\nVOICES IN OUR ELECTION PROCESSES.\nBUT I DON'T THINK THAT MEANS THE PROCESS IS RIGGED.\n>> OKAY. I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO MIKE\nPENCE RALLYING VOTERS IN UTAH. HERE HE IS.\n>> THIS IS OUR CHANCE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.\nI MEAN, THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS, THERE IS ONLY TWO NAMES ON\nTHAT BALLOT THAT HAVE A CHANCE TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES OF AMERICA. AND WHILE I'LL ALWAYS RESPECT\nTHE RIGHT OF ANY MAN OR WOMAN TO CAST THEIR VOTE IN THE MANNER\nTHAT THEY SEE BEST, I HAVE GOT SAY TO YOU FROM MY HEART I TRULY\nDO BELIEVE A VOTE FOR ANY CANDIDATE OTHER THAN DONALD\nTRUMP IS A VOTE FOR A WEAKER AMERICA AT HOME AND ABROAD.\n>> THAT'S HIM ON WEDNESDAY IN YOUR TERRITORY IN SALT LAKE\nCITY. WHAT'S YOUR REACTION?\n>> WELL, I WOULD SAY THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT US TO\nBELIEVE. BOTH PARTIES WANT US TO BELIEVE\nTHAT WE HAVE TO CHOOSE EITHER DONALD TRUMP OR HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHE TRUTH IS, AMERICANS DON'T WANT EITHER ONE OF THEM.\nWE WANT BETTER CHOICES IN THIS COUNTRY.\nWE NEED BETTER LEADERS. WE NEEDS WISE AND HONEST LEADERS\nWHO WILL PUT THE INTERESTS OF AMERICANS FIRST.\nIF WE KEEP CHOOSING HILLARY CLINTON OR DONALD TRUMP WE ARE\nGOING KEEP GETTING HILLARY CLINTON OR DONALD TRUMP.\nWE ARE STANDING FOR SOMETHING NEW IT'S TIME FOR A NEW\nGENERATION OF LEADERSHIP, AND A NEW CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT THAT\nWILL BE OPEN TO PEOPLE OF ALL RACES AND RELIGIONS A MOVEMENT\nIN THIS COUNTRY THAT WILL TAKE TO US A BRIGHTER FUTURE THAN WE\nWILL HAVE WITH EITHER HILLARY CLINTON OR DONALD TRUMP.\nWE HAVE GOT TO BUILD IT NOW IN THIS ELECTION NOT AFTER NOVEMBER\n8th WHEN OTHERS WILL HAVE FAILED TO STAND UP FOR WHAT'S GOOD AND\nTRUE. WE KNOW WE NEED TO DO THIS NOW.\nTHAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING. >> I WANT TO READ A TWEET.\nLOU DOBBS FIRED OFF AN ANGRY TWEET WRITING LOOK DEEPER HE IS\nNOTHING BUT A GLOBALIST ROMNEY AND MORMON MAFIA TOOL.\nWHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT? >> I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM LOU\nWHAT EXACTLY THE MORMON MAFIA IS.\nI WOULD LOVE TO HEAR HIM DESCRIBE WHAT THAT IS.\nI THINK IT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING COMBINATION.\nIT'S SORT OF A SILLY THING. WE'VE BEEN HAVING FUN WITH IT.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE BEEN HAVING FUN\nWITH IT. IN A I WITH A IT'S NOT\nSURPRISING. DONALD TRUMP AND HIS SUPPORTERS\nHAVE BEEN ATTACKING PEOPLE BASED ON THEIR RACE AND RELIGION AND\nGENDER. THE REALITY IS THIS ONE IS FOR\nEVERYONE, THIS COUNTRY IS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE OF ALL RELIGIONS,\nNO RELIGION AT ALL. THIS COUNTRY IS FOR PEOPLE WHO\nHAVE SKIN LIKE MINE OR SKIN LIKE YOURS.\nTHIS IS A COUNTRY FOR EVERYONE. AND WE CANNOT HAVE A PRESIDENT\nOR A MOVEMENT IN THIS COUNTRY -- WE CANNOT TOLERATE IT IF THEY\nARE GOING TO ATTACK US BASED ON WHO WE ARE.\nIN THIS COUNTRY, WE BELIEVE THAT ALL MEN AND WOMEN ARE CREATED\nCALL. AND MINDY FIN MY RUNNING MATE\nAND I I ARE STANDING JUST FOR THAT.\n>> HE DID IT RIGHT HERE ON THIS SHOW, HE SAID HE COULD NO LONGER\nSUPPORT OR ENDORSE DONALD TRUMP. YOU SAY DONALD TRUMP IS LOSING\nBADLY. CHAF, ET CETERA RESCINDED HIS\nENDORSEMENT OF THE ACT TEST HOLLYWOODIN AT THAT TWEETING I\nAM NOT ENDORSING TRUMP, BUT I AM VOTING FOR HIM, HRC IS BAD FOR\nAMERICA. EVEN THOUGH HE SAID HE COULD NOT\nLOOK HIS 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER IN THE EYE AND STILL ENDORSE HIM\nAFTER WHAT HE SAW AND HEARD ON THAT TAPE -- WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF\nTHAT REVERSAL? >> I'VE GOT SAY I'M DEEPLY\nDISAPPOINTED BY THAT. YOU KNOW, EVENTUALLY OUR LEADERS\nHAVE TO START STANDING ON PRINCIPLE.\nTHEY HAVE TO START STANDING ON PRINCIPLE AT THE VERY LEAST WHEN\nWE ARE BEING ATTACKED. WHEN AMERICANS ARE BEING\nATTACKED OUR LEADERS NEED TO STAND UP.\nESPECIALLY WHEN WOMEN HAVE BEEN ATTACKED IN THIS ELECTION CYCLE\nBY DONALD TRUMP AS CONSISTENTLY AS THEY HAVE BEEN.\nBY THE WAY, THAT TAPE, THAT WAS NOTHING NEW -- THE TRUMP TAPE,\nTHAT WAS NOTHING NEW. HE HAS BEEN ATTACKING PEOPLE\nTHROUGH THE ELECTION BASED ON THEIR GENDER, THEIR RACE, THEIR\nRELIGION. IF OUR LEADERS WILL NOT STAND UP\nTO THAT AND NOT STAND UP FOR US, WHAT BUSINESS DO THEY HAVE\nLEADING US. >> EVAN McMULLEN, I APPRECIATE\nYOUR TIME. THANK YOU.\n>> THANK YOU, DON. >> UP NEXT, COULD THERE BE\nVIOLENCE IN THE STREETS IF TRUMP LOSES THE ELECTION TO CLINTON?\nOMINOUS WARNING SIGNS. TONIGHT.",

I'M GLAD TO HAVE YOU BOTH ON\nGENTLEMEN. >> GOOD EVENING.\n>> GREAT TO BE WITH YOU. >> YOU FIRST, KEVIN.\nTHE NEW YORK TIMES IS WARNING OF A REVOLUTION IF HILLARY CLINTON\nWINS. I'M GOING TO SAY THAT AGAIN,\nWARNING OF A REVOLUTION. WHEN YOU PAIR THAT WITH A TWEET,\nJOE WALSH CALLING FOR FOLKS TO GRAB THEIR MUSKETS AND YOU HAVE\nTHE WISCONSIN SHERIFF SAYING IT'S PITCH FORK TIME AND WHAT\nELSE? SOMETHING I FORGET WHAT ELSE.\n>> RIGHT. >> AND TORCHES.\nTHIS IS SERIOUS, RIGHT? >> WELL, LOOK, WE ARE AT THAT\nTIME IN THIS ELECTION WHERE THE RHETORIC GETS PRETTY HEATED, AND\nPEOPLE ARE TRYING TO DRIVE A LOT OF ENTHUSIASM AMONG SUPPORTERS,\nAND THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE A CASE ABOUT THE STAKES OF THIS\nELECTION, AND SOMETIMES THAT CAN GO OVER BOARD WHEN YOU TALK\nABOUT GRABBING MUSKETS AND THINGS LIKE THAT.\nWHEN YOU LISTEN TO SECRETARIES OF STATE AND LISTEN TO THE VAST\nMAJORITY OF THE ELECTED OFFICIALS AROUND OUR COUNTRY,\nTHEY HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF CONFIDENCE ABOUT THE INTEGRITY\nOF OUR ELECTION AND HAVE MADE IT CLEAR TO THOSE\nPARTICIPATING IN THIS ELECTION. SO I TAKE MY CUE FROM A LOT OF\nTHOSE LEADERS AND I FEEL PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT AMERICA WILL ONCE\nAGAIN IN THIS ELECTION, TEST ITS DEMOCRACY ON ELECTION DAY.\n>> I WONDER, IF YOU'VE HEARD ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE FROM\nTHE \"NEW YORK TIMES\"? THEY SPOKE TO MANY TRUMP\nSUPPORTERS HERE AND ONE OF THEM IS SAYING, JARED WHOLEBROOKE OF\nWISCONSIN IS SAYING IF DONALD TRUMP LOST TO HILLARY CLINTON,\nIT COULD LEAD TO ANOTHER REVOLUTIONARY WAR.\nPEOPLE WILL MARCH, HE SAID, HE WORKS AT A CALL CENTER.\nTHEY'RE GOING TO NEED TO DO WHATEVER TO GET HER OUT OF\nOFFICE BECAUSE SHE DOES NOT BELONG THERE.\nIF PUSH COMES TO SHOVE AND MRS. CLINTON HAS TO GO BY ANY MEANS\nNECESSARY, IT WILL BE DONE. >> YEAH, I DON'T LIKE THIS\nRHETORIC. I DON'T LIKE WHEN AL GORE WAS\nOBJECTED TO, AND THERE WERE SEVERAL MEMBERS ELECTED INTO THE\nUNITED STATES CONGRESS. I'M TOO YOUNG TO REMEMBER THE\nELECTION OF 1,800. >> COME ON, ARI, REALLY?\n>> JUST A LITTLE BIT. BUT BACK THEN THEY SAID YOU\nCOULDN'T WALK ACROSS THE STREET WITHOUT FEAR OF GET CANED.\nTHE HAVE IT REOLE WAS SO BAD BETWEEN ADAMS AND JEFFERSON'S\nFORCES. THIS RHETORIC IS WRONG AND I\nDENOUNCE IT. I ALSO DENOUNCE THE REPUBLICAN\nVIOLENCE THAT TOOK PLACE THAT GOT FIRE BOMBED THIS WEEK, THERE\nWAS VANDALISM ON TRUMP'S STAR ON THE SIDEWALK AND A COUPLE YEARS\nAGO THERE WAS AN ATTEMPTED MURDER IN THE FAMILY RESEARCH\nCENTER IN WASHINGTON, D.C. THAT WAS POLITICALLY MOTIVATED.\nSO I DEPLORE THE VIOLENCE AND I DEPLORE THE RHETORIC.\n>> HERE'S THE THING, ARI. WE'LL GET ON TELEVISION AND\nARGUE IN POLITICAL WAYS BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE DON'T LIKE EACH\nOTHER. >> THAT'S RIGHT.\n>> AND I SEE YOU -- AND WE TALK OR DISAGREE OR MAYBE HAVE A\nBEER. PEOPLE AT HOME IT IS MUCH MORE\nSERIOUS THAN THAT. I'M WONDERING IF YOU'RE WORRYING\nABOUT THE SKEWING. IN ANY WAY OF THE CURRENT\nREALITY. SOME OF THOSE IN RIGHT-WING\nMEDIA SAID TRUMP WAS WINNING AND AHEAD IN THE POLLS AND THE ONLY\nWAY HE CAN LOSE IS BY RIGGING. I'M WONDERING IF THE\nCONSERVATIVE MEDIA IS DOING AN INJUSTICE BY SKEWING THE\nREALITY? WILL BE SO DISAPPOINTED IF HE\nDOES LOSE. >> THEY ARE.\nJUST AS LEFT-WG MEDIA WAS DOING THE SAME THING IN 200 WITH\nAL GORE. IT'S WRONG AND YOU HAVE TO BE ON\nTHE LOOK OUT IS WHAT DOES WHOEVER LOSES AND I THINK THAT'S\nDONALD TRUMP, WHAT DOES HE SAY.  IF DONALD TRUMP STIRS THE POT,\nIT'S A VERY DANGEROUS THING TO DO.\nLEADERS CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT DO THAT.\nI WOULD BE SURPRISED AT THE END OF THE DAY IF THAT'S WHAT HE\nACTUALLY DOES. IF THE RACE IS EXTRAORDINARILY\nCLOSE, YOU BETTER BELIEVE BOTH SIDES ARE GOING TO LAWYER UP AND\nWE'LL BE RIGHT BACK TO WHERE WE WERE IN 2000 WHERE PEOPLE ARE\nFIGHTING FOR EVERY LAST SECOND AND VOTE.\nBUT IF IT'S A LOPSIDED VICTORY YOU NEED TO ACCEPT IT IN THIS\nCOUNTRY. >> KEVIN, WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT\nTHAT? >> FIRST OF ALL I AGREE WITH\nARI'S MAIN POINT, WHICH IS EXTREMISM AND RHETORIC THAT GOES\nBEYOND THE PAIL IS NOT BEING MONOPOLIZED JUST BY THE RIGHT\nFOR LEFT. WE SEE IT ON BOTH SIDES.\n>> WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS BEFORE THE ELECTION HAS EVEN\nHAPPENED -- AND I'LL GO WITH HIS -- WITH THE PREMISE SAYING\nTHAT IT HAPPENED WITH LEFT-WING MEDIA -- SO-CALLED LEFT-WING\nMEDIA AFTER THE FACT THERE WAS A CONTESTED ELECTION BUT GO ON.\n>> WHAT ABOUT THE VIOLENCE IN NORTH CAROLINA TO A REPUBLICAN\nPARTY? >> IT'S NOT -- IT'S NOT JUST\nSITUATIONAL, DON. IT'S SYSTEMIC ON BOTH THE RIGHT\nAND THE LEFT. I THINK WHERE I AGREE WITH YOU\nIS THAT WHAT I WOULD WORRY ABOUT WITH DONALD TRUMP'S CURRENT\nRHETORIC RIGHT NOW IS THAT HE IS DOING WHAT I\nTHINK MANY ENEMIES AROUND THE GLOBE WANT TO SEE WHICH IS\nTRIVIALIZING DEMOCRACY. AND SAYING THAT THE ELECTION\nPROCESS IS RIGGED BEFOREHAND. I DO BELIEVE IT IS INCUMBENT\nUPON THOSE SECRETARIES OF STATE, WHETHER REPUBLICANS OR\nDEMOCRATS, AND LEADERS IN WASHINGTON OR AROUND THE\nCOUNTRY, WHO ARE REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS, TO MAKE THE CASE\nABOUT THE INTEGRITY OF OUR DEMOCRACY AND HOW IMPORTANT OUR\nSYSTEM IS AND THAT PEACEFUL TRANSITION OF POWER IS A VERY\nIMPORTANT SHINING PART OF OUR -- DEMOCRATIC TRADITIONS AND THAT'S\nWHAT I WOULD WORRY ABOUT. AND THAT'S\nWHY IT'S INCUMBENT UPON LEADERS THEY POINT IT OUT AND DISAGREE\nWITH IT. >> YOU JUST ARTICULATED MY POINT\nBETTER THAN I DID BECAUSE YOU'RE MUCH SMARTER.\n>> IMPOSSIBLE. >> I WANT TO PLAY SOMETHING FROM\nTHE FIRST LADY AND HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGNING DOWN IN\nNORTH CAROLINA TODAY AND THEY'RE PUTTING THE ROLE OF WOMEN FRONT\nAND CENTER IN THIS ELECTION. WATCH THIS.\n>> I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE TO SAY THIS RIGHT?\nBUT INDEED, DIGNITY AND RESPECT FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS IS ALSO ON\nTHE BALLOT IN THIS ELECTION. >> AS HILLARY SAID WE WANT A\nPRESIDENT WHO VALUES AND HONORS WOMEN, WHO TEACHES OUR DAUGHTERS\nAND OUR SONS THAT WOMEN ARE FULL AND EQUAL HUMAN BEINGS WORTHY,\nDESERVING OF LOVE AND RESPECT. >> ARI, ARE THEY RIGHT?\nIS RESPECT FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS ON THE BALLOT?\n>> YOU KNOW, I TRY TO ELEVATE THE DEBATE ABOVE THAT TYPE OF\nSLICING OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE INTO SUCH TERMS, YOU KNOW, OF\nCOURSE IT WAS THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN, THE CLINTON FOUNDATION\nWHO DOESN'T PAY WOMEN EQUAL TO THEIR MEN AND I FIND EVERY\nELECTION CYCLE YOU SEE THESE ISSUES THROWN AT REPUBLICANS.\nTHEY SAID GEORGE BUSH WAS RACIST, JOHN McCAIN IS RACIST,\nAND MITT ROMNEY IS RACIST. IT'S THE SAME RHETORIC THAT'S\nTAKEN OUT AGAINST REPUBLICANS EVERY CYCLE, AND I THINK THAT'S\nONE OF THE REASONS WE'RE JUST A DIVIDED COUNTRY.\nIT'S A TACTIC DEMOCRATS MAKE EVERY RACE INCLUDING WHEN AL\nGORE SAID -- AND THIS ISN'T ABOUT WOMEN BUT WHEN AL GORE\nSAID REPUBLICANS WANTED TO RECREATE SLAVERY, PUT Y'ALL BACK\nIN CHAINS.

THE LAST FEW DAYS HE HAS\nSPECIFYING HE IS MAKING A BROADER CRITIQUE ABOUT THE WHOLE\nSYSTEM. THE POINT IS, ONE, THIS IS NO\nEVIDENCE. TWO, WE HAVE BEEN AT THIS A YEAR\nAND A HALF. VOTERS HAVE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT\nOF INFORMATION ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON TO\nALLOW THEMSELVES TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION IN THIS CASE.\nWE AT THE WASHINGTON POST, CNN, OTHER OUTLETS DO THIS VERY\nDILIGENTLY EVERY DAY.

I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO DONALD\nTRUMP IN A RALLY IN OHIO TALKING ABOUT THE INNER CITY.\n>> WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON OUR GHETTOS SO THAT YOU TAKE A LOOK\nAT WHAT'S GOING ON WHERE YOU HAVE POCKETS OF AREAS OF LAND\nWHERE YOU HAVE THE INNER CITIES AND YOU HAVE SO MANY THINGS, SO\nMANY PROBLEMS, SO MANY HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE PROBLEMS.\nTHE VIOLENCE, THE DEATHS, THE LACK OF EDUCATION, NO JOBS.\nWE'RE GOING TO WORK WITH THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, AND\nWE'RE GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF THE INNER CITY.\nWE'RE GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM.\n>> DAVID WHY -- WHY DOES HE CONTINUE TO DO THIS?\nAND WHY AREN'T HIS ADVISORS EDUCATING HIM?\nCOULD THEY NOT KNOW BETTER AS WELL?\nWHAT'S GOING ON HERE? >> THREE PROBLEMS, DON.\nONE IS THAT TO THE EXTENT DONALD TRUMP IS OUTREACHING TO\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VITAERS IT'S TOO LITTLE TOO LATE.\nIN OUR NEW WASHINGTON POST POLL, HILLARY CLINTON IS PLUS 81\nPOINTS AMONG BLACK VOTERS. HE IS NOT GOING TO CATCH UP A\nWEEK AND A HALF OUT. ANOTHER PROBLEM IS THE LANGUAGE\nHE USES. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO COME AFTER\nME ON TWITTER SAYING THIS IS BEING POLITICALLY CORRECT.\nPART OF BEING ABLE TO TALK TO A SLICE OF THE ELECTORATE IS TO BE\nABLE TO SORT OF USE THEIR LANGUAGE.\nPEOPLE DON'T USE THE WORD GHETTO ANYMORE THIS THIS CONTEXT.\nJUST LIKE YOU DON'T USE THE WORD NEGRO OR ARIENTAL ANYMORE.\nIT IS NOT A MATTER OF POLITICAL CORRECTNESS.\nIT'S A MATTER OF BEING POLITE AND RESPECTFUL AND UNDERSTANDING\nWHERE THE DISCUSSION HAS DONE. LASTLY IT'S THAT ON POLICY,\nRIGHT? HE GAVE A SPEECH YESTERDAY WHERE\nHE TALKED ABOUT HIS NEW DEAL FOR BLACK AMERICA WHICH I DON'T\nTHINK FULLY RESONATES WITH THE BLACK ELECTORATE BUT AT LEAST\nWAS AN EARNEST ATTEMPT. BUT THEN HE UNDERWOULD UP\nSTEPPING ON THAT MESSAGE TODAY AND BEING ALL OVER THE PLACE AND\nNOT DRIVING THE POINT HOME. AS MARK SAID HE HAS A TOUGH TIME\nSTAYING ON MESSAGE. IN TERMS OF HIS ADVISORS, I\nCOULDN'T HAZARD A GUESS. THIS IS A BROADER PROBLEM FOR\nREPUBLICANS AT LARGE NOT JUST THE DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN.\n>> GHETTOS WAS JUST -- I -- >> YEAH.\n>> YEAH.

THIS IS WHERE WE ARE SPENDING\nMORE TIME AS WE GET CLOSER TO NOVEMBER 8th.\n>> YOU SAID YOU ARE A MODEST CAMPAIGN WITH A MODEST GOAL.\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS MAP, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE 270 THAT YOU\nHAVE TO GET, EVEN IF YOU GET UTAH, EVAN, I MEAN YOU ARE GOING\nONLY TO HAVE SIX LORE LOCK TORL VOTES.\nTHAT'S NOT A PATH TO THE PRESIDENCY.\nWHAT IS YOUR ENGAME? >> WELL, ACTUALLY, THAT'S NOT\nABSOLUTELY TRUE. IF THE RACE IS CLOSE BETWEEN\nDONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON AND WE ONE OR TWO OR THREE\nSTATES IN THE MOUNTAIN WEST THEN THAT MEANS WE CAN ACTUALLY BLOCK\nTHEM BOTH AND TAKE THE ELECTION TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,\nWHERE WE LIKE OUR CHANCES. NOW THE TRUTH IS, HILLARY\nCLINTON IS DOMINATING DONALD TRUMP IN MOST PROJECTIONS BY\nSUCH A LARGE MARGIN THAT THE RACE ISN'T CLOSE RIGHT NOW.\nBUT I GO CAN HAPPEN IN THIS KIND OF RACE IN THE NEXT TEN DAYS.\nAND WE'LL SEE HOW IT DEVELOPS. BUT WE ARE GOING TO BE READY TO\nBLOCK THEM BOTH IF THE RACE IS TIGHT.\nREGARDLESS, THOUGH, WE ARE BUILDING A NEW CONSERVATIVE\nMOVEMENT THAT IS OPEN THE ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF\nTHEIR RACE OR RELIGION. WE BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT IN\nTHIS RACE TO STAND FOR EQUALITY AND TO STAND FOR THE CAUSE OF\nLIBERTY. WE DON'T SEE EITHER DONALD TRUMP\nOR HILLARY CLINTON DOING THAT IN THE WAY WE THINK IT NEEDS TO BE\nDONE, OR AT ALL, SO WE ARE STANDING FOR THAT AND BUILDING\nSOMETHING NEW WHICH WE THINK IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO PROVIDE\nTHE KIND OF LEADERSHIP THAT THIS COUNTRY NEEDS.\n>> OKAY. SO YOU SAID YOU WANT TO BLOCK\nBOTH OF THEM. AND YOU TAKE IT TO THE HOUSE OF\nREPRESENTATIVES. I'M WONDERING, DO YOU AGREE WITH\nDONALD TRUMP? DO YOU THINK IT IS A RIGGED\nSYSTEM? DO YOU THINK THAT CHANGES NEED\nTO BE MADE TO THE SYSTEM? >> I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGGED\nSYSTEM. IF THERE IS ANY RIGGING OF THE\nSYSTEM AT ALL IT'S BEING DONE BY VLADIMIR PUTIN HACKING OUR\nCOMPUTER SYSTEMS AND USING OTHER MEANS TO INFLUENCE AND UNDERMINE\nTHE U.S. ELECTION PROCESS. NO.\nBUT OTHERWISE I DON'T AGREE THAT IT'S RIGGED.\nI THINK I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE SYSTEM, THE PROCESS OPENED UP A\nBIT. I THINK GIVEN THAT WE HAVE FROM\nTHE MAJOR PARTIES BOTH HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP, TWO\nCANDIDATES WHO ARE SO HUGELY UNPOPULAR, AND I BELIEVE UNFIT\nFOR THE RESPONSIBILITIES THEY SEEK -- I DO THINK WE NEED NEW\nVOICES IN OUR ELECTION PROCESSES.\nBUT I DON'T THINK THAT MEANS THE PROCESS IS RIGGED.\n>> OKAY. I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO MIKE\nPENCE RALLYING VOTERS IN UTAH. HERE HE IS.\n>> THIS IS OUR CHANCE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.\nI MEAN, THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS, THERE IS ONLY TWO NAMES ON\nTHAT BALLOT THAT HAVE A CHANCE TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES OF AMERICA. AND WHILE I'LL ALWAYS RESPECT\nTHE RIGHT OF ANY MAN OR WOMAN TO CAST THEIR VOTE IN THE MANNER\nTHAT THEY SEE BEST, I HAVE GOT SAY TO YOU FROM MY HEART I TRULY\nDO BELIEVE A VOTE FOR ANY CANDIDATE OTHER THAN DONALD\nTRUMP IS A VOTE FOR A WEAKER AMERICA AT HOME AND ABROAD.\n>> THAT'S HIM ON WEDNESDAY IN YOUR TERRITORY IN SALT LAKE\nCITY. WHAT'S YOUR REACTION?\n>> WELL, I WOULD SAY THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT US TO\nBELIEVE. BOTH PARTIES WANT US TO BELIEVE\nTHAT WE HAVE TO CHOOSE EITHER DONALD TRUMP OR HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHE TRUTH IS, AMERICANS DON'T WANT EITHER ONE OF THEM.\nWE WANT BETTER CHOICES IN THIS COUNTRY.\nWE NEED BETTER LEADERS. WE NEEDS WISE AND HONEST LEADERS\nWHO WILL PUT THE INTERESTS OF AMERICANS FIRST.\nIF WE KEEP CHOOSING HILLARY CLINTON OR DONALD TRUMP WE ARE\nGOING KEEP GETTING HILLARY CLINTON OR DONALD TRUMP.\nWE ARE STANDING FOR SOMETHING NEW IT'S TIME FOR A NEW\nGENERATION OF LEADERSHIP, AND A NEW CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT THAT\nWILL BE OPEN TO PEOPLE OF ALL RACES AND RELIGIONS A MOVEMENT\nIN THIS COUNTRY THAT WILL TAKE TO US A BRIGHTER FUTURE THAN WE\nWILL HAVE WITH EITHER HILLARY CLINTON OR DONALD TRUMP.\nWE HAVE GOT TO BUILD IT NOW IN THIS ELECTION NOT AFTER NOVEMBER\n8th WHEN OTHERS WILL HAVE FAILED TO STAND UP FOR WHAT'S GOOD AND\nTRUE. WE KNOW WE NEED TO DO THIS NOW.\nTHAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING. >> I WANT TO READ A TWEET.\nLOU DOBBS FIRED OFF AN ANGRY TWEET WRITING LOOK DEEPER HE IS\nNOTHING BUT A GLOBALIST ROMNEY AND MORMON MAFIA TOOL.\nWHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT? >> I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM LOU\nWHAT EXACTLY THE MORMON MAFIA IS.\nI WOULD LOVE TO HEAR HIM DESCRIBE WHAT THAT IS.\nI THINK IT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING COMBINATION.\nIT'S SORT OF A SILLY THING. WE'VE BEEN HAVING FUN WITH IT.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE BEEN HAVING FUN\nWITH IT. IN A I WITH A IT'S NOT\nSURPRISING. DONALD TRUMP AND HIS SUPPORTERS\nHAVE BEEN ATTACKING PEOPLE BASED ON THEIR RACE AND RELIGION AND\nGENDER. THE REALITY IS THIS ONE IS FOR\nEVERYONE, THIS COUNTRY IS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE OF ALL RELIGIONS,\nNO RELIGION AT ALL. THIS COUNTRY IS FOR PEOPLE WHO\nHAVE SKIN LIKE MINE OR SKIN LIKE YOURS.\nTHIS IS A COUNTRY FOR EVERYONE. AND WE CANNOT HAVE A PRESIDENT\nOR A MOVEMENT IN THIS COUNTRY -- WE CANNOT TOLERATE IT IF THEY\nARE GOING TO ATTACK US BASED ON WHO WE ARE.\nIN THIS COUNTRY, WE BELIEVE THAT ALL MEN AND WOMEN ARE CREATED\nCALL. AND MINDY FIN MY RUNNING MATE\nAND I I ARE STANDING JUST FOR THAT.\n>> HE DID IT RIGHT HERE ON THIS SHOW, HE SAID HE COULD NO LONGER\nSUPPORT OR ENDORSE DONALD TRUMP. YOU SAY DONALD TRUMP IS LOSING\nBADLY. CHAF, ET CETERA RESCINDED HIS\nENDORSEMENT OF THE ACT TEST HOLLYWOODIN AT THAT TWEETING I\nAM NOT ENDORSING TRUMP, BUT I AM VOTING FOR HIM, HRC IS BAD FOR\nAMERICA. EVEN THOUGH HE SAID HE COULD NOT\nLOOK HIS 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER IN THE EYE AND STILL ENDORSE HIM\nAFTER WHAT HE SAW AND HEARD ON THAT TAPE -- WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF\nTHAT REVERSAL? >> I'VE GOT SAY I'M DEEPLY\nDISAPPOINTED BY THAT. YOU KNOW, EVENTUALLY OUR LEADERS\nHAVE TO START STANDING ON PRINCIPLE.\nTHEY HAVE TO START STANDING ON PRINCIPLE AT THE VERY LEAST WHEN\nWE ARE BEING ATTACKED. WHEN AMERICANS ARE BEING\nATTACKED OUR LEADERS NEED TO STAND UP.\nESPECIALLY WHEN WOMEN HAVE BEEN ATTACKED IN THIS ELECTION CYCLE\nBY DONALD TRUMP AS CONSISTENTLY AS THEY HAVE BEEN.\nBY THE WAY, THAT TAPE, THAT WAS NOTHING NEW -- THE TRUMP TAPE,\nTHAT WAS NOTHING NEW. HE HAS BEEN ATTACKING PEOPLE\nTHROUGH THE ELECTION BASED ON THEIR GENDER, THEIR RACE, THEIR\nRELIGION. IF OUR LEADERS WILL NOT STAND UP\nTO THAT AND NOT STAND UP FOR US, WHAT BUSINESS DO THEY HAVE\nLEADING US. >> EVAN McMULLEN, I APPRECIATE\nYOUR TIME. THANK YOU.\n>> THANK YOU, DON. >> UP NEXT, COULD THERE BE\nVIOLENCE IN THE STREETS IF TRUMP LOSES THE ELECTION TO CLINTON?\nOMINOUS WARNING SIGNS. TONIGHT.",

ARI FLEISHER, WHITE HOUSE PRESS\nSECRETARY FOR GEORGE W. BUSH AND KEVIN MADDEN, REPUBLICAN\nSTRATEGIST. I'M GLAD TO HAVE YOU BOTH ON\nGENTLEMEN. >> GOOD EVENING.\n>> GREAT TO BE WITH YOU. >> YOU FIRST, KEVIN.\nTHE NEW YORK TIMES IS WARNING OF A REVOLUTION IF HILLARY CLINTON\nWINS. I'M GOING TO SAY THAT AGAIN,\nWARNING OF A REVOLUTION. WHEN YOU PAIR THAT WITH A TWEET,\nJOE WALSH CALLING FOR FOLKS TO GRAB THEIR MUSKETS AND YOU HAVE\nTHE WISCONSIN SHERIFF SAYING IT'S PITCH FORK TIME AND WHAT\nELSE? SOMETHING I FORGET WHAT ELSE.\n>> RIGHT. >> AND TORCHES.\nTHIS IS SERIOUS, RIGHT? >> WELL, LOOK, WE ARE AT THAT\nTIME IN THIS ELECTION WHERE THE RHETORIC GETS PRETTY HEATED, AND\nPEOPLE ARE TRYING TO DRIVE A LOT OF ENTHUSIASM AMONG SUPPORTERS,\nAND THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE A CASE ABOUT THE STAKES OF THIS\nELECTION, AND SOMETIMES THAT CAN GO OVER BOARD WHEN YOU TALK\nABOUT GRABBING MUSKETS AND THINGS LIKE THAT.\nWHEN YOU LISTEN TO SECRETARIES OF STATE AND LISTEN TO THE VAST\nMAJORITY OF THE ELECTED OFFICIALS AROUND OUR COUNTRY,\nTHEY HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF CONFIDENCE ABOUT THE INTEGRITY\nOF OUR ELECTION AND HAVE MADE IT CLEAR TO THOSE\nPARTICIPATING IN THIS ELECTION. SO I TAKE MY CUE FROM A LOT OF\nTHOSE LEADERS AND I FEEL PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT AMERICA WILL ONCE\nAGAIN IN THIS ELECTION, TEST ITS DEMOCRACY ON ELECTION DAY.\n>> I WONDER, IF YOU'VE HEARD ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE FROM\nTHE \"NEW YORK TIMES\"? THEY SPOKE TO MANY TRUMP\nSUPPORTERS HERE AND ONE OF THEM IS SAYING, JARED WHOLEBROOKE OF\nWISCONSIN IS SAYING IF DONALD TRUMP LOST TO HILLARY CLINTON,\nIT COULD LEAD TO ANOTHER REVOLUTIONARY WAR.\nPEOPLE WILL MARCH, HE SAID, HE WORKS AT A CALL CENTER.\nTHEY'RE GOING TO NEED TO DO WHATEVER TO GET HER OUT OF\nOFFICE BECAUSE SHE DOES NOT BELONG THERE.\nIF PUSH COMES TO SHOVE AND MRS. CLINTON HAS TO GO BY ANY MEANS\nNECESSARY, IT WILL BE DONE. >> YEAH, I DON'T LIKE THIS\nRHETORIC. I DON'T LIKE WHEN AL GORE WAS\nOBJECTED TO, AND THERE WERE SEVERAL MEMBERS ELECTED INTO THE\nUNITED STATES CONGRESS. I'M TOO YOUNG TO REMEMBER THE\nELECTION OF 1,800. >> COME ON, ARI, REALLY?\n>> JUST A LITTLE BIT. BUT BACK THEN THEY SAID YOU\nCOULDN'T WALK ACROSS THE STREET WITHOUT FEAR OF GET CANED.\nTHE HAVE IT REOLE WAS SO BAD BETWEEN ADAMS AND JEFFERSON'S\nFORCES. THIS RHETORIC IS WRONG AND I\nDENOUNCE IT. I ALSO DENOUNCE THE REPUBLICAN\nVIOLENCE THAT TOOK PLACE THAT GOT FIRE BOMBED THIS WEEK, THERE\nWAS VANDALISM ON TRUMP'S STAR ON THE SIDEWALK AND A COUPLE YEARS\nAGO THERE WAS AN ATTEMPTED MURDER IN THE FAMILY RESEARCH\nCENTER IN WASHINGTON, D.C. THAT WAS POLITICALLY MOTIVATED.\nSO I DEPLORE THE VIOLENCE AND I DEPLORE THE RHETORIC.\n>> HERE'S THE THING, ARI. WE'LL GET ON TELEVISION AND\nARGUE IN POLITICAL WAYS BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE DON'T LIKE EACH\nOTHER. >> THAT'S RIGHT.\n>> AND I SEE YOU -- AND WE TALK OR DISAGREE OR MAYBE HAVE A\nBEER. PEOPLE AT HOME IT IS MUCH MORE\nSERIOUS THAN THAT. I'M WONDERING IF YOU'RE WORRYING\nABOUT THE SKEWING. IN ANY WAY OF THE CURRENT\nREALITY. SOME OF THOSE IN RIGHT-WING\nMEDIA SAID TRUMP WAS WINNING AND AHEAD IN THE POLLS AND THE ONLY\nWAY HE CAN LOSE IS BY RIGGING. I'M WONDERING IF THE\nCONSERVATIVE MEDIA IS DOING AN INJUSTICE BY SKEWING THE\nREALITY? WILL BE SO DISAPPOINTED IF HE\nDOES LOSE. >> THEY ARE.\nJUST AS LEFT-WG MEDIA WAS DOING THE SAME THING IN 200 WITH\nAL GORE. IT'S WRONG AND YOU HAVE TO BE ON\nTHE LOOK OUT IS WHAT DOES WHOEVER LOSES AND I THINK THAT'S\nDONALD TRUMP, WHAT DOES HE SAY.  IF DONALD TRUMP STIRS THE POT,\nIT'S A VERY DANGEROUS THING TO DO.\nLEADERS CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT DO THAT.\nI WOULD BE SURPRISED AT THE END OF THE DAY IF THAT'S WHAT HE\nACTUALLY DOES. IF THE RACE IS EXTRAORDINARILY\nCLOSE, YOU BETTER BELIEVE BOTH SIDES ARE GOING TO LAWYER UP AND\nWE'LL BE RIGHT BACK TO WHERE WE WERE IN 2000 WHERE PEOPLE ARE\nFIGHTING FOR EVERY LAST SECOND AND VOTE.\nBUT IF IT'S A LOPSIDED VICTORY YOU NEED TO ACCEPT IT IN THIS\nCOUNTRY. >> KEVIN, WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT\nTHAT? >> FIRST OF ALL I AGREE WITH\nARI'S MAIN POINT, WHICH IS EXTREMISM AND RHETORIC THAT GOES\nBEYOND THE PAIL IS NOT BEING MONOPOLIZED JUST BY THE RIGHT\nFOR LEFT. WE SEE IT ON BOTH SIDES.\n>> WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS BEFORE THE ELECTION HAS EVEN\nHAPPENED -- AND I'LL GO WITH HIS -- WITH THE PREMISE SAYING\nTHAT IT HAPPENED WITH LEFT-WING MEDIA -- SO-CALLED LEFT-WING\nMEDIA AFTER THE FACT THERE WAS A CONTESTED ELECTION BUT GO ON.\n>> WHAT ABOUT THE VIOLENCE IN NORTH CAROLINA TO A REPUBLICAN\nPARTY? >> IT'S NOT -- IT'S NOT JUST\nSITUATIONAL, DON. IT'S SYSTEMIC ON BOTH THE RIGHT\nAND THE LEFT. I THINK WHERE I AGREE WITH YOU\nIS THAT WHAT I WOULD WORRY ABOUT WITH DONALD TRUMP'S CURRENT\nRHETORIC RIGHT NOW IS THAT HE IS DOING WHAT I\nTHINK MANY ENEMIES AROUND THE GLOBE WANT TO SEE WHICH IS\nTRIVIALIZING DEMOCRACY. AND SAYING THAT THE ELECTION\nPROCESS IS RIGGED BEFOREHAND. I DO BELIEVE IT IS INCUMBENT\nUPON THOSE SECRETARIES OF STATE, WHETHER REPUBLICANS OR\nDEMOCRATS, AND LEADERS IN WASHINGTON OR AROUND THE\nCOUNTRY, WHO ARE REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS, TO MAKE THE CASE\nABOUT THE INTEGRITY OF OUR DEMOCRACY AND HOW IMPORTANT OUR\nSYSTEM IS AND THAT PEACEFUL TRANSITION OF POWER IS A VERY\nIMPORTANT SHINING PART OF OUR -- DEMOCRATIC TRADITIONS AND THAT'S\nWHAT I WOULD WORRY ABOUT. AND THAT'S\nWHY IT'S INCUMBENT UPON LEADERS THEY POINT IT OUT AND DISAGREE\nWITH IT. >> YOU JUST ARTICULATED MY POINT\nBETTER THAN I DID BECAUSE YOU'RE MUCH SMARTER.\n>> IMPOSSIBLE. >> I WANT TO PLAY SOMETHING FROM\nTHE FIRST LADY AND HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGNING DOWN IN\nNORTH CAROLINA TODAY AND THEY'RE PUTTING THE ROLE OF WOMEN FRONT\nAND CENTER IN THIS ELECTION. WATCH THIS.\n>> I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE TO SAY THIS RIGHT?\nBUT INDEED, DIGNITY AND RESPECT FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS IS ALSO ON\nTHE BALLOT IN THIS ELECTION. >> AS HILLARY SAID WE WANT A\nPRESIDENT WHO VALUES AND HONORS WOMEN, WHO TEACHES OUR DAUGHTERS\nAND OUR SONS THAT WOMEN ARE FULL AND EQUAL HUMAN BEINGS WORTHY,\nDESERVING OF LOVE AND RESPECT. >> ARI, ARE THEY RIGHT?\nIS RESPECT FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS ON THE BALLOT?\n>> YOU KNOW, I TRY TO ELEVATE THE DEBATE ABOVE THAT TYPE OF\nSLICING OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE INTO SUCH TERMS, YOU KNOW, OF\nCOURSE IT WAS THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN, THE CLINTON FOUNDATION\nWHO DOESN'T PAY WOMEN EQUAL TO THEIR MEN AND I FIND EVERY\nELECTION CYCLE YOU SEE THESE ISSUES THROWN AT REPUBLICANS.\nTHEY SAID GEORGE BUSH WAS RACIST, JOHN McCAIN IS RACIST,\nAND MITT ROMNEY IS RACIST. IT'S THE SAME RHETORIC THAT'S\nTAKEN OUT AGAINST REPUBLICANS EVERY CYCLE, AND I THINK THAT'S\nONE OF THE REASONS WE'RE JUST A DIVIDED COUNTRY.\nIT'S A TACTIC DEMOCRATS MAKE EVERY RACE INCLUDING WHEN AL\nGORE SAID -- AND THIS ISN'T ABOUT WOMEN BUT WHEN AL GORE\nSAID REPUBLICANS WANTED TO RECREATE SLAVERY, PUT Y'ALL BACK\nIN CHAINS.

THERE CAN BE USER ERROR, MACHINE\nERROR, THERE CAN BE LOTS OF IRAER AUTOS.\nBUT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT RIGGING WAS INVOLVED.\nAND IN MY VIEW THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THERE IS SOME KIND OF\nSYSTEMIC FIX IN ON THIS ELECTION.\nWE TALKED ABOUT THIS A LOT. IN THAT SAME O'REILLY INTERVIEW\nDONALD TRUMP TALKED ABOUT THE IDEA THAT IT'S NOT JUST THAT HE\nIS TALKING ABOUT THE VOTER RIGGING, THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED.\nHE BLAMED IT AGAIN ON THE MEDIA. THE LAST FEW DAYS HE HAS\nSPECIFYING HE IS MAKING A BROADER CRITIQUE ABOUT THE WHOLE\nSYSTEM. THE POINT IS, ONE, THIS IS NO\nEVIDENCE. TWO, WE HAVE BEEN AT THIS A YEAR\nAND A HALF. VOTERS HAVE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT\nOF INFORMATION ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON TO\nALLOW THEMSELVES TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION IN THIS CASE.\nWE AT THE WASHINGTON POST, CNN, OTHER OUTLETS DO THIS VERY\nDILIGENTLY EVERY DAY.

WHEN DONALD TRUMP IS ATTACKING\nHILLARY CLINTON ABOUT WIKILEAKS, WHEN HE IS TALKING ABOUT HOW HE\nIS GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, WHEN HE TALKED WITH OBAMA\nCARE, TRADE DEFICITS, HE DOES BETTER.\nWHEN HE IS TALKING ABOUT THE ACCESS HOLLYWOOD, WHICH HE COULD\nGET AWAY WITH NOT ADDRESSING IN SUCH DETAIL THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR\nHIM. >> TRUMP HAS BEEN TRYING TO\nREACH OUT TO AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS TRYING TO EXPAND HIS\nAPPEAL. I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO DONALD\nTRUMP IN A RALLY IN OHIO TALKING ABOUT THE INNER CITY.\n>> WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON OUR GHETTOS SO THAT YOU TAKE A LOOK\nAT WHAT'S GOING ON WHERE YOU HAVE POCKETS OF AREAS OF LAND\nWHERE YOU HAVE THE INNER CITIES AND YOU HAVE SO MANY THINGS, SO\nMANY PROBLEMS, SO MANY HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE PROBLEMS.\nTHE VIOLENCE, THE DEATHS, THE LACK OF EDUCATION, NO JOBS.\nWE'RE GOING TO WORK WITH THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, AND\nWE'RE GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF THE INNER CITY.\nWE'RE GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM.\n>> DAVID WHY -- WHY DOES HE CONTINUE TO DO THIS?\nAND WHY AREN'T HIS ADVISORS EDUCATING HIM?\nCOULD THEY NOT KNOW BETTER AS WELL?\nWHAT'S GOING ON HERE? >> THREE PROBLEMS, DON.\nONE IS THAT TO THE EXTENT DONALD TRUMP IS OUTREACHING TO\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VITAERS IT'S TOO LITTLE TOO LATE.\nIN OUR NEW WASHINGTON POST POLL, HILLARY CLINTON IS PLUS 81\nPOINTS AMONG BLACK VOTERS. HE IS NOT GOING TO CATCH UP A\nWEEK AND A HALF OUT. ANOTHER PROBLEM IS THE LANGUAGE\nHE USES. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO COME AFTER\nME ON TWITTER SAYING THIS IS BEING POLITICALLY CORRECT.\nPART OF BEING ABLE TO TALK TO A SLICE OF THE ELECTORATE IS TO BE\nABLE TO SORT OF USE THEIR LANGUAGE.\nPEOPLE DON'T USE THE WORD GHETTO ANYMORE THIS THIS CONTEXT.\nJUST LIKE YOU DON'T USE THE WORD NEGRO OR ARIENTAL ANYMORE.\nIT IS NOT A MATTER OF POLITICAL CORRECTNESS.\nIT'S A MATTER OF BEING POLITE AND RESPECTFUL AND UNDERSTANDING\nWHERE THE DISCUSSION HAS DONE. LASTLY IT'S THAT ON POLICY,\nRIGHT? HE GAVE A SPEECH YESTERDAY WHERE\nHE TALKED ABOUT HIS NEW DEAL FOR BLACK AMERICA WHICH I DON'T\nTHINK FULLY RESONATES WITH THE BLACK ELECTORATE BUT AT LEAST\nWAS AN EARNEST ATTEMPT. BUT THEN HE UNDERWOULD UP\nSTEPPING ON THAT MESSAGE TODAY AND BEING ALL OVER THE PLACE AND\nNOT DRIVING THE POINT HOME. AS MARK SAID HE HAS A TOUGH TIME\nSTAYING ON MESSAGE. IN TERMS OF HIS ADVISORS, I\nCOULDN'T HAZARD A GUESS. THIS IS A BROADER PROBLEM FOR\nREPUBLICANS AT LARGE NOT JUST THE DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN.\n>> GHETTOS WAS JUST -- I -- >> YEAH.\n>> YEAH.

THE LATEST MONMOUTH UNIVERSITY\nPOLL SHOWS TRUMP LEADING 34%, 28% FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nYOU ARE COMING CLOSE THERE AT 20%.\nWHY ARE YOU DOING SO WELL THERE. >> MOST OTHER POLLS HAVE US IN A\nDEADLOCKED TIE OR EVEN ABOVE DONALD TRUMP.\nWE ARE EXCITED ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE.\nWE CAME HERE AND ARE SPENDING TYPE IN THE MOUNTAIN WEST\nBECAUSE THESE ARE THE STATES WHO REJECTED DONALD TRUMP AND\nHILLARY CLINTON. THESE ARE PEOPLE LOOKING FOR A\nPER CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION. THIS IS WHERE WE ARE SPENDING\nMORE TIME AS WE GET CLOSER TO NOVEMBER 8th.\n>> YOU SAID YOU ARE A MODEST CAMPAIGN WITH A MODEST GOAL.\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS MAP, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE 270 THAT YOU\nHAVE TO GET, EVEN IF YOU GET UTAH, EVAN, I MEAN YOU ARE GOING\nONLY TO HAVE SIX LORE LOCK TORL VOTES.\nTHAT'S NOT A PATH TO THE PRESIDENCY.\nWHAT IS YOUR ENGAME? >> WELL, ACTUALLY, THAT'S NOT\nABSOLUTELY TRUE. IF THE RACE IS CLOSE BETWEEN\nDONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON AND WE ONE OR TWO OR THREE\nSTATES IN THE MOUNTAIN WEST THEN THAT MEANS WE CAN ACTUALLY BLOCK\nTHEM BOTH AND TAKE THE ELECTION TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,\nWHERE WE LIKE OUR CHANCES. NOW THE TRUTH IS, HILLARY\nCLINTON IS DOMINATING DONALD TRUMP IN MOST PROJECTIONS BY\nSUCH A LARGE MARGIN THAT THE RACE ISN'T CLOSE RIGHT NOW.\nBUT I GO CAN HAPPEN IN THIS KIND OF RACE IN THE NEXT TEN DAYS.\nAND WE'LL SEE HOW IT DEVELOPS. BUT WE ARE GOING TO BE READY TO\nBLOCK THEM BOTH IF THE RACE IS TIGHT.\nREGARDLESS, THOUGH, WE ARE BUILDING A NEW CONSERVATIVE\nMOVEMENT THAT IS OPEN THE ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF\nTHEIR RACE OR RELIGION. WE BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT IN\nTHIS RACE TO STAND FOR EQUALITY AND TO STAND FOR THE CAUSE OF\nLIBERTY. WE DON'T SEE EITHER DONALD TRUMP\nOR HILLARY CLINTON DOING THAT IN THE WAY WE THINK IT NEEDS TO BE\nDONE, OR AT ALL, SO WE ARE STANDING FOR THAT AND BUILDING\nSOMETHING NEW WHICH WE THINK IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO PROVIDE\nTHE KIND OF LEADERSHIP THAT THIS COUNTRY NEEDS.\n>> OKAY. SO YOU SAID YOU WANT TO BLOCK\nBOTH OF THEM. AND YOU TAKE IT TO THE HOUSE OF\nREPRESENTATIVES. I'M WONDERING, DO YOU AGREE WITH\nDONALD TRUMP? DO YOU THINK IT IS A RIGGED\nSYSTEM? DO YOU THINK THAT CHANGES NEED\nTO BE MADE TO THE SYSTEM? >> I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGGED\nSYSTEM. IF THERE IS ANY RIGGING OF THE\nSYSTEM AT ALL IT'S BEING DONE BY VLADIMIR PUTIN HACKING OUR\nCOMPUTER SYSTEMS AND USING OTHER MEANS TO INFLUENCE AND UNDERMINE\nTHE U.S. ELECTION PROCESS. NO.\nBUT OTHERWISE I DON'T AGREE THAT IT'S RIGGED.\nI THINK I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE SYSTEM, THE PROCESS OPENED UP A\nBIT. I THINK GIVEN THAT WE HAVE FROM\nTHE MAJOR PARTIES BOTH HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP, TWO\nCANDIDATES WHO ARE SO HUGELY UNPOPULAR, AND I BELIEVE UNFIT\nFOR THE RESPONSIBILITIES THEY SEEK -- I DO THINK WE NEED NEW\nVOICES IN OUR ELECTION PROCESSES.\nBUT I DON'T THINK THAT MEANS THE PROCESS IS RIGGED.\n>> OKAY. I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO MIKE\nPENCE RALLYING VOTERS IN UTAH. HERE HE IS.\n>> THIS IS OUR CHANCE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.\nI MEAN, THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS, THERE IS ONLY TWO NAMES ON\nTHAT BALLOT THAT HAVE A CHANCE TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES OF AMERICA. AND WHILE I'LL ALWAYS RESPECT\nTHE RIGHT OF ANY MAN OR WOMAN TO CAST THEIR VOTE IN THE MANNER\nTHAT THEY SEE BEST, I HAVE GOT SAY TO YOU FROM MY HEART I TRULY\nDO BELIEVE A VOTE FOR ANY CANDIDATE OTHER THAN DONALD\nTRUMP IS A VOTE FOR A WEAKER AMERICA AT HOME AND ABROAD.\n>> THAT'S HIM ON WEDNESDAY IN YOUR TERRITORY IN SALT LAKE\nCITY. WHAT'S YOUR REACTION?\n>> WELL, I WOULD SAY THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT US TO\nBELIEVE. BOTH PARTIES WANT US TO BELIEVE\nTHAT WE HAVE TO CHOOSE EITHER DONALD TRUMP OR HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHE TRUTH IS, AMERICANS DON'T WANT EITHER ONE OF THEM.\nWE WANT BETTER CHOICES IN THIS COUNTRY.\nWE NEED BETTER LEADERS. WE NEEDS WISE AND HONEST LEADERS\nWHO WILL PUT THE INTERESTS OF AMERICANS FIRST.\nIF WE KEEP CHOOSING HILLARY CLINTON OR DONALD TRUMP WE ARE\nGOING KEEP GETTING HILLARY CLINTON OR DONALD TRUMP.\nWE ARE STANDING FOR SOMETHING NEW IT'S TIME FOR A NEW\nGENERATION OF LEADERSHIP, AND A NEW CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT THAT\nWILL BE OPEN TO PEOPLE OF ALL RACES AND RELIGIONS A MOVEMENT\nIN THIS COUNTRY THAT WILL TAKE TO US A BRIGHTER FUTURE THAN WE\nWILL HAVE WITH EITHER HILLARY CLINTON OR DONALD TRUMP.\nWE HAVE GOT TO BUILD IT NOW IN THIS ELECTION NOT AFTER NOVEMBER\n8th WHEN OTHERS WILL HAVE FAILED TO STAND UP FOR WHAT'S GOOD AND\nTRUE. WE KNOW WE NEED TO DO THIS NOW.\nTHAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING. >> I WANT TO READ A TWEET.\nLOU DOBBS FIRED OFF AN ANGRY TWEET WRITING LOOK DEEPER HE IS\nNOTHING BUT A GLOBALIST ROMNEY AND MORMON MAFIA TOOL.\nWHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT? >> I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM LOU\nWHAT EXACTLY THE MORMON MAFIA IS.\nI WOULD LOVE TO HEAR HIM DESCRIBE WHAT THAT IS.\nI THINK IT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING COMBINATION.\nIT'S SORT OF A SILLY THING. WE'VE BEEN HAVING FUN WITH IT.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE BEEN HAVING FUN\nWITH IT. IN A I WITH A IT'S NOT\nSURPRISING. DONALD TRUMP AND HIS SUPPORTERS\nHAVE BEEN ATTACKING PEOPLE BASED ON THEIR RACE AND RELIGION AND\nGENDER. THE REALITY IS THIS ONE IS FOR\nEVERYONE, THIS COUNTRY IS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE OF ALL RELIGIONS,\nNO RELIGION AT ALL. THIS COUNTRY IS FOR PEOPLE WHO\nHAVE SKIN LIKE MINE OR SKIN LIKE YOURS.\nTHIS IS A COUNTRY FOR EVERYONE. AND WE CANNOT HAVE A PRESIDENT\nOR A MOVEMENT IN THIS COUNTRY -- WE CANNOT TOLERATE IT IF THEY\nARE GOING TO ATTACK US BASED ON WHO WE ARE.\nIN THIS COUNTRY, WE BELIEVE THAT ALL MEN AND WOMEN ARE CREATED\nCALL. AND MINDY FIN MY RUNNING MATE\nAND I I ARE STANDING JUST FOR THAT.\n>> HE DID IT RIGHT HERE ON THIS SHOW, HE SAID HE COULD NO LONGER\nSUPPORT OR ENDORSE DONALD TRUMP. YOU SAY DONALD TRUMP IS LOSING\nBADLY. CHAF, ET CETERA RESCINDED HIS\nENDORSEMENT OF THE ACT TEST HOLLYWOODIN AT THAT TWEETING I\nAM NOT ENDORSING TRUMP, BUT I AM VOTING FOR HIM, HRC IS BAD FOR\nAMERICA. EVEN THOUGH HE SAID HE COULD NOT\nLOOK HIS 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER IN THE EYE AND STILL ENDORSE HIM\nAFTER WHAT HE SAW AND HEARD ON THAT TAPE -- WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF\nTHAT REVERSAL? >> I'VE GOT SAY I'M DEEPLY\nDISAPPOINTED BY THAT. YOU KNOW, EVENTUALLY OUR LEADERS\nHAVE TO START STANDING ON PRINCIPLE.\nTHEY HAVE TO START STANDING ON PRINCIPLE AT THE VERY LEAST WHEN\nWE ARE BEING ATTACKED. WHEN AMERICANS ARE BEING\nATTACKED OUR LEADERS NEED TO STAND UP.\nESPECIALLY WHEN WOMEN HAVE BEEN ATTACKED IN THIS ELECTION CYCLE\nBY DONALD TRUMP AS CONSISTENTLY AS THEY HAVE BEEN.\nBY THE WAY, THAT TAPE, THAT WAS NOTHING NEW -- THE TRUMP TAPE,\nTHAT WAS NOTHING NEW. HE HAS BEEN ATTACKING PEOPLE\nTHROUGH THE ELECTION BASED ON THEIR GENDER, THEIR RACE, THEIR\nRELIGION. IF OUR LEADERS WILL NOT STAND UP\nTO THAT AND NOT STAND UP FOR US, WHAT BUSINESS DO THEY HAVE\nLEADING US. >> EVAN McMULLEN, I APPRECIATE\nYOUR TIME. THANK YOU.\n>> THANK YOU, DON. >> UP NEXT, COULD THERE BE\nVIOLENCE IN THE STREETS IF TRUMP LOSES THE ELECTION TO CLINTON?\nOMINOUS WARNING SIGNS. TONIGHT.",

ARI FLEISHER, WHITE HOUSE PRESS\nSECRETARY FOR GEORGE W. BUSH AND KEVIN MADDEN, REPUBLICAN\nSTRATEGIST. I'M GLAD TO HAVE YOU BOTH ON\nGENTLEMEN. >> GOOD EVENING.\n>> GREAT TO BE WITH YOU. >> YOU FIRST, KEVIN.\nTHE NEW YORK TIMES IS WARNING OF A REVOLUTION IF HILLARY CLINTON\nWINS. I'M GOING TO SAY THAT AGAIN,\nWARNING OF A REVOLUTION. WHEN YOU PAIR THAT WITH A TWEET,\nJOE WALSH CALLING FOR FOLKS TO GRAB THEIR MUSKETS AND YOU HAVE\nTHE WISCONSIN SHERIFF SAYING IT'S PITCH FORK TIME AND WHAT\nELSE? SOMETHING I FORGET WHAT ELSE.\n>> RIGHT. >> AND TORCHES.\nTHIS IS SERIOUS, RIGHT? >> WELL, LOOK, WE ARE AT THAT\nTIME IN THIS ELECTION WHERE THE RHETORIC GETS PRETTY HEATED, AND\nPEOPLE ARE TRYING TO DRIVE A LOT OF ENTHUSIASM AMONG SUPPORTERS,\nAND THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE A CASE ABOUT THE STAKES OF THIS\nELECTION, AND SOMETIMES THAT CAN GO OVER BOARD WHEN YOU TALK\nABOUT GRABBING MUSKETS AND THINGS LIKE THAT.\nWHEN YOU LISTEN TO SECRETARIES OF STATE AND LISTEN TO THE VAST\nMAJORITY OF THE ELECTED OFFICIALS AROUND OUR COUNTRY,\nTHEY HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF CONFIDENCE ABOUT THE INTEGRITY\nOF OUR ELECTION AND HAVE MADE IT CLEAR TO THOSE\nPARTICIPATING IN THIS ELECTION. SO I TAKE MY CUE FROM A LOT OF\nTHOSE LEADERS AND I FEEL PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT AMERICA WILL ONCE\nAGAIN IN THIS ELECTION, TEST ITS DEMOCRACY ON ELECTION DAY.\n>> I WONDER, IF YOU'VE HEARD ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE FROM\nTHE \"NEW YORK TIMES\"? THEY SPOKE TO MANY TRUMP\nSUPPORTERS HERE AND ONE OF THEM IS SAYING, JARED WHOLEBROOKE OF\nWISCONSIN IS SAYING IF DONALD TRUMP LOST TO HILLARY CLINTON,\nIT COULD LEAD TO ANOTHER REVOLUTIONARY WAR.\nPEOPLE WILL MARCH, HE SAID, HE WORKS AT A CALL CENTER.\nTHEY'RE GOING TO NEED TO DO WHATEVER TO GET HER OUT OF\nOFFICE BECAUSE SHE DOES NOT BELONG THERE.\nIF PUSH COMES TO SHOVE AND MRS. CLINTON HAS TO GO BY ANY MEANS\nNECESSARY, IT WILL BE DONE. >> YEAH, I DON'T LIKE THIS\nRHETORIC. I DON'T LIKE WHEN AL GORE WAS\nOBJECTED TO, AND THERE WERE SEVERAL MEMBERS ELECTED INTO THE\nUNITED STATES CONGRESS. I'M TOO YOUNG TO REMEMBER THE\nELECTION OF 1,800. >> COME ON, ARI, REALLY?\n>> JUST A LITTLE BIT. BUT BACK THEN THEY SAID YOU\nCOULDN'T WALK ACROSS THE STREET WITHOUT FEAR OF GET CANED.\nTHE HAVE IT REOLE WAS SO BAD BETWEEN ADAMS AND JEFFERSON'S\nFORCES. THIS RHETORIC IS WRONG AND I\nDENOUNCE IT. I ALSO DENOUNCE THE REPUBLICAN\nVIOLENCE THAT TOOK PLACE THAT GOT FIRE BOMBED THIS WEEK, THERE\nWAS VANDALISM ON TRUMP'S STAR ON THE SIDEWALK AND A COUPLE YEARS\nAGO THERE WAS AN ATTEMPTED MURDER IN THE FAMILY RESEARCH\nCENTER IN WASHINGTON, D.C. THAT WAS POLITICALLY MOTIVATED.\nSO I DEPLORE THE VIOLENCE AND I DEPLORE THE RHETORIC.\n>> HERE'S THE THING, ARI. WE'LL GET ON TELEVISION AND\nARGUE IN POLITICAL WAYS BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE DON'T LIKE EACH\nOTHER. >> THAT'S RIGHT.\n>> AND I SEE YOU -- AND WE TALK OR DISAGREE OR MAYBE HAVE A\nBEER. PEOPLE AT HOME IT IS MUCH MORE\nSERIOUS THAN THAT. I'M WONDERING IF YOU'RE WORRYING\nABOUT THE SKEWING. IN ANY WAY OF THE CURRENT\nREALITY. SOME OF THOSE IN RIGHT-WING\nMEDIA SAID TRUMP WAS WINNING AND AHEAD IN THE POLLS AND THE ONLY\nWAY HE CAN LOSE IS BY RIGGING. I'M WONDERING IF THE\nCONSERVATIVE MEDIA IS DOING AN INJUSTICE BY SKEWING THE\nREALITY? WILL BE SO DISAPPOINTED IF HE\nDOES LOSE. >> THEY ARE.\nJUST AS LEFT-WG MEDIA WAS DOING THE SAME THING IN 200 WITH\nAL GORE. IT'S WRONG AND YOU HAVE TO BE ON\nTHE LOOK OUT IS WHAT DOES WHOEVER LOSES AND I THINK THAT'S\nDONALD TRUMP, WHAT DOES HE SAY.  IF DONALD TRUMP STIRS THE POT,\nIT'S A VERY DANGEROUS THING TO DO.\nLEADERS CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT DO THAT.\nI WOULD BE SURPRISED AT THE END OF THE DAY IF THAT'S WHAT HE\nACTUALLY DOES. IF THE RACE IS EXTRAORDINARILY\nCLOSE, YOU BETTER BELIEVE BOTH SIDES ARE GOING TO LAWYER UP AND\nWE'LL BE RIGHT BACK TO WHERE WE WERE IN 2000 WHERE PEOPLE ARE\nFIGHTING FOR EVERY LAST SECOND AND VOTE.\nBUT IF IT'S A LOPSIDED VICTORY YOU NEED TO ACCEPT IT IN THIS\nCOUNTRY. >> KEVIN, WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT\nTHAT? >> FIRST OF ALL I AGREE WITH\nARI'S MAIN POINT, WHICH IS EXTREMISM AND RHETORIC THAT GOES\nBEYOND THE PAIL IS NOT BEING MONOPOLIZED JUST BY THE RIGHT\nFOR LEFT. WE SEE IT ON BOTH SIDES.\n>> WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS BEFORE THE ELECTION HAS EVEN\nHAPPENED -- AND I'LL GO WITH HIS -- WITH THE PREMISE SAYING\nTHAT IT HAPPENED WITH LEFT-WING MEDIA -- SO-CALLED LEFT-WING\nMEDIA AFTER THE FACT THERE WAS A CONTESTED ELECTION BUT GO ON.\n>> WHAT ABOUT THE VIOLENCE IN NORTH CAROLINA TO A REPUBLICAN\nPARTY? >> IT'S NOT -- IT'S NOT JUST\nSITUATIONAL, DON. IT'S SYSTEMIC ON BOTH THE RIGHT\nAND THE LEFT. I THINK WHERE I AGREE WITH YOU\nIS THAT WHAT I WOULD WORRY ABOUT WITH DONALD TRUMP'S CURRENT\nRHETORIC RIGHT NOW IS THAT HE IS DOING WHAT I\nTHINK MANY ENEMIES AROUND THE GLOBE WANT TO SEE WHICH IS\nTRIVIALIZING DEMOCRACY. AND SAYING THAT THE ELECTION\nPROCESS IS RIGGED BEFOREHAND. I DO BELIEVE IT IS INCUMBENT\nUPON THOSE SECRETARIES OF STATE, WHETHER REPUBLICANS OR\nDEMOCRATS, AND LEADERS IN WASHINGTON OR AROUND THE\nCOUNTRY, WHO ARE REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS, TO MAKE THE CASE\nABOUT THE INTEGRITY OF OUR DEMOCRACY AND HOW IMPORTANT OUR\nSYSTEM IS AND THAT PEACEFUL TRANSITION OF POWER IS A VERY\nIMPORTANT SHINING PART OF OUR -- DEMOCRATIC TRADITIONS AND THAT'S\nWHAT I WOULD WORRY ABOUT. AND THAT'S\nWHY IT'S INCUMBENT UPON LEADERS THEY POINT IT OUT AND DISAGREE\nWITH IT. >> YOU JUST ARTICULATED MY POINT\nBETTER THAN I DID BECAUSE YOU'RE MUCH SMARTER.\n>> IMPOSSIBLE. >> I WANT TO PLAY SOMETHING FROM\nTHE FIRST LADY AND HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGNING DOWN IN\nNORTH CAROLINA TODAY AND THEY'RE PUTTING THE ROLE OF WOMEN FRONT\nAND CENTER IN THIS ELECTION. WATCH THIS.\n>> I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE TO SAY THIS RIGHT?\nBUT INDEED, DIGNITY AND RESPECT FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS IS ALSO ON\nTHE BALLOT IN THIS ELECTION. >> AS HILLARY SAID WE WANT A\nPRESIDENT WHO VALUES AND HONORS WOMEN, WHO TEACHES OUR DAUGHTERS\nAND OUR SONS THAT WOMEN ARE FULL AND EQUAL HUMAN BEINGS WORTHY,\nDESERVING OF LOVE AND RESPECT. >> ARI, ARE THEY RIGHT?\nIS RESPECT FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS ON THE BALLOT?\n>> YOU KNOW, I TRY TO ELEVATE THE DEBATE ABOVE THAT TYPE OF\nSLICING OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE INTO SUCH TERMS, YOU KNOW, OF\nCOURSE IT WAS THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN, THE CLINTON FOUNDATION\nWHO DOESN'T PAY WOMEN EQUAL TO THEIR MEN AND I FIND EVERY\nELECTION CYCLE YOU SEE THESE ISSUES THROWN AT REPUBLICANS.\nTHEY SAID GEORGE BUSH WAS RACIST, JOHN McCAIN IS RACIST,\nAND MITT ROMNEY IS RACIST. IT'S THE SAME RHETORIC THAT'S\nTAKEN OUT AGAINST REPUBLICANS EVERY CYCLE, AND I THINK THAT'S\nONE OF THE REASONS WE'RE JUST A DIVIDED COUNTRY.\nIT'S A TACTIC DEMOCRATS MAKE EVERY RACE INCLUDING WHEN AL\nGORE SAID -- AND THIS ISN'T ABOUT WOMEN BUT WHEN AL GORE\nSAID REPUBLICANS WANTED TO RECREATE SLAVERY, PUT Y'ALL BACK\nIN CHAINS. THIS IS THE DIVISIVENESS OF THE\nDEMOCRATS RESORT TO EVERY CYCLE. >> I'VE GOT TO PUSH BACK.\nYOU HEAR SO MUCH ABOUT DONALD TRUMP THAT IS JUST THERE AND IF\nI COULD JUST FIRE UP THE",

ALSO, THERE IS NEW EVIDENCE\nBILL CLINTON USED HIS FOUNDATION TO FATTEN HIS\nWALLET. WE WILL HAVE REPORTS ON\nBOTH. AS WE HAVE NOTED OBAMACARE\nRATES ARE EXPECTED TO RISE BY DOUBLE DIGITS.\nTONIGHT WE TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE NUMBERS AND WHO\nWILL BE HARDEST HIT. AS OF THIS EVENING HILLARY\nCLINTON LEADS IN THE REAL CLEAR POLITICS AVERAGE BY\n5.8 POINTS IN THE FOUR WAY RACE AND 5.7 IN A TWO-WAY.\nBETS ODDS CONTINUE TO SHOW MRS. CLINTON A PROHIBITIVE\nFAVORITE BY NEARLY 5 TO 1. A GOOD POLL WITH A TRACK\nRECORD IN 2012 BUSINESS INVESTORS DAILY POLL STILL\nSHOWS A TIGHT RACE. HILLARY CLINTON IS UP BY 2\nIN POET A TWO AND FOUR-WAY RACE AND FOR THAT AND OTHER\nRECENT POLLING FOX DECISION TEAM CHRIS ANDERSON PART OF\nA BOSTON CONSULTING FIRM THAT BEARS HIS NAME.\nHELLO, CHRIS. >> HI, BRIT.\n>> WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT TONIGHT?\nYOU SEE A LOT OF POLLS. WHAT INTERESTS YOU TONIGHT?\n>> WELL, THERE ARE THREE POLLS OUT THAT ARE\nINTERESTING FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THEY ARE\nSTATES THAT TRUMP HAS TARGETED AND WOULD PROBABLY\nNEED TO PICK UP AT LEAST A COUPLE OF THEM TO WIN THE\nPRESIDENCY. OBAMA WON WITH 332 VOTES, OF\nCOURSE, IN 2012. TRUMP WOULD NOT ONLY NEED TO\nHOLD ALL OF THE STATES MITT ROMNEY WON BUT HE WOULD NEED\nTO PICK OFF 63 ELECTORAL VOTES FROM STATES THAT OBAMA\nWON. WE WERE LOOKING AT RECENT\nPOLLS IN NEVADA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE AND PENNSYLVANIA,\nWHICH HAVE BEEN TALKED ABOUT AS POTENTIAL TARGETS IN THAT\nREGARD. >> HE HAS BEEN CAMPAIGNING\nIN ALL THOSE PLACES. WHAT ARE YOU SEEING RIGHT\nNOW IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, WHICH IS HE HAD BEEN DOWN THERE.\nHAS THAT BEGUN TO LOOK A LITTLE BETTER FOR HIM?\nWHAT ARE YOU SEEING? >> WHAT WE'RE SEEING ACROSS\nALL THE STATES AND NATIONALLY, THE REAL HARD\nCEILING FOR TRUMP IT LOOKS LIKE, IT'S RARE THAT YOU SEE\nA POLL THAT HAS HIM ABOVE 44%.\nMEANWHILE, IT'S VERY RARE THAT YOU SEE A POLL THAT HAS\nCLINTON BELOW 44%. SO THERE -- IT STARTED TO\nLOOK LIKE TRUMP'S CEILING IS RIGHT AROUND WHERE CLINTON'S\nFLOOR IS, WHICH IS REALLY DIFFICULT TO OVERCOME.\nIN NEW HAMPSHIRE, SPECIFICALLY, WE'RE SEEING\nTHERE IS A POLL OUT FROM MOP MOUTH THAT HAS IT A\nFOUR-POINT RACE, WHICH YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE WILL SAY\nTHAT'S PRETTY CLOSE. HE COULD OVERCOME THAT.\nBUT, WHEN YOU LOOK UNDERNEATH THE HOOD AND\nALMOST ALL THESE STATES, YOU HAVE A REAL SMALL NUMBER OF\nUNDECIDES. HE WOULD NEED TO PRETTY MUCH\nWIN THEM ACROSS THE BOARD TO CATCH HER.\nAND HE WOULD NEED TO SHAKE LOOSE SOME OF THE THIRD\nPARTY SUPPORT AND GET THEM TO COME HIS WAY.\nHOWEVER, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THOSE VOTERS, ON THEIR OWN,\nTHIRD PARTY SUPPORTERS UNDECIDED VOTERS, THEY ARE\nEVEN MORE UNFAVORABLE TOWARDS TRUMP THAN VOTERS\nOVERALL. THEY DON'T THINK HE HAS THE\nJUDGMENT, TEMPERAMENT, OR THE QUALIFICATIONS TO BE\nPRESIDENT. >> SO THIS IS --\n>> -- THEY DO THINK HILLARY CLINTON DOES.\n>> SO YOU LOOK IN THOSE SITUATIONS, IT LOOKS\nPOSSIBLE, AT LEAST ON PAPER BUT DIFFICULT ON THE GROUND.\nIS THAT A FAIR WAY TO SUM IT UP?\n>> EXACTLY. YOU KNOW, WE'RE 10 DAYS OUT\nRIGHT NOW. 2, 3, 4 POINTS ON A POLL\nSOUNDS LIKE IT COULD BE OVERCOME, BUT THAT IS A\nREALLY HERCULEAN AMOUNT OF VOTE TO MAKE UP AT THIS\nPOINT IN THE RACE. >> WHAT HAPPENED NEVADA?\nNEVADA HAS BEEN THE STATE THAT HE HAS LOOKED LIKE HE\nMIGHT DO OKAY THERE THAT LOOKS PRETTY CLOSE RIGHT\nNOW, CORRECT? >> IT DOES.\nIT DOES. THERE WAS A POLL OUT TODAY\nTHAT HAD THE RACE, I THINK IT HAD THE RACE TIED,\nACTUALLY. SAME DYNAMIC, LOW, LOW\nCEILING FOR BOTH CANDIDATES THERE.\nONE THING THAT WHEN ELECTION DAY GETS HERE IS REALLY\nGOING TO FAVOR THE CLINTON CAMP IS THAT HER VOTE IN\nNEVADA IS CONCENTRATED IN MORE URBAN SUBURBAN AREAS,\nLAS VEGAS, RENO WHERE TRUMP'S VOTE IS OUT IN RURAL\nAREAS. SO WHEN IT COMES TO GETTING\nOUT THE VOTE, IT'S OBVIOUSLY A LOT EASIER TO DO WHEN YOU\nARE WALKING AROUND NEIGHBORHOODS AND WHEN YOU\nHAPPEN TO BE DRIVING AROUND, YOU KNOW, THE PLAINS.\n>> RIGHT. TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT\nPENNSYLVANIA. OBVIOUSLY, THAT'S A BIG --\nIT'S A BIG PRIZE. IT'S ONE WHERE HE HAS\nCAMPAIGNED HARD. IT'S BROKEN REPUBLICAN\nHEARTS IN MANY A PREVIOUS CYCLE.\nHE WOULD NEED ONE OF THOSE BIG STATES TO WIN.\n>> YEAH. >> IS THAT ONE WHERE HE HAS\nA REAL CHANCE OR WHAT DO YOU THINK?\n>> YOU KNOW, IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE IT.\nTHE MARGIN THERE FOR HIM IS -- POLL OUT TODAY OR\nYESTERDAY HAD CLINTON UP 7 THERE.\nTRUMP IS UNDER 80% AMONG REPUBLICANS IN PENNSYLVANIA.\nAND HE IS LOSING INDEPENDENTS.\nHE IS NOT GOING TO WIN ANYWHERE UNLESS HE\nCONSOLIDATES THE BASE SUPPORT AND WINS\nINDEPENDENTS RIGHT NOW HE IS NOT DOING THAT.\n>> WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?\nBECAUSE WE KNOW MITT ROMNEY GOT 93% OF THE REPUBLICAN\nVOTE IN 2012. DOES IT LOOK TO YOU AS IF\nTHESE VOTERS, THESE REPUBLICAN VOTERS WILL COME\nHOME TO HIM IN TIME OR COULD THEY -- DOES IT LOOK TO YOU\nLIKE THEY ARE RESISTANT TO HIM NO MATTER WHAT.\n>> I THINK THAT THERE IS A PORTION OF THEM THAT ARE\nRESISTANT TO HIM NO MATTER WHAT.\nAND, YOU KNOW, WE SEE THAT IN THE POLLING, AND I THINK\nTHAT A LOT OF US JUST TALKING TO OUR FRIENDS AND\nCOLLEAGUES HAVE SEEN THAT, TOO.\n>> WELL, I GUESS WHAT ANY TRUMP SUPPORTER WOULD TELL\nYOU IS THAT THIS HAS BEEN AN ELECTION YEAR LIKE NO OTHER.\nAND AUGUST KINDS OF THINGS HAVE HAPPENED AND WE HAVE\nALL, MYSELF INCLUDED, BEEN WRONG BEFORE.\nSO I GUESS THAT GIVES THEM SOMETHING TO HOPE FOR.\n>> YEAH. AND I WOULDN'T DISAGREE WITH\nTHEM AT ALL THAT THIS HAS BEEN A WEIRD CYCLE.\nSO WE WILL SEE 10 DAYS FROM NOW.\n>> WE WILL BE THERE ON ELECTION NIGHT.\nCHRIS, THANKS VERY MUCH FOR DOING.\nTHIS NICE TO SEE YOU. TODAY'S WIKILEAKS EMAIL DUMP\nRAISES SERIOUS QUESTIONS FORMERT BILL CLINTON AND HIS AIDS\nGENERATED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR BOTH THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION AND THE CLINTON FAMILY.\nPERSONALLY. FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL\nCORRESPONDENT ED HENRY HAS THE STORY.\n>> WHILE THE SHEAR NUMBER OF WIKILEAKS EMAILS HAS MADE IT\nHARD FOR ALLEGATIONS OF PAY-TO-PLAY AT THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION TO BREAK THROUGH WITH VOTERS --\n>> -- THE MORE EMAILS WIKILEAKS RELEASES, THE MORE\nLINES BETWEEN THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, THE SECRETARY OF\nSTATE'S OFFICE AND THE CLINTONS' PERSONAL FINANCES\nTHEY ALL GET BLURRED. >> TONIGHT, THERE ARE FRESH\nSIGNS REPUBLICANS MAY HAVE HIT PAYDIRT, LITERALLY, WITH\nA DAMAGING EMAIL ABOUT FORMER PRESIDENT BILL\nCLINTON LINING HIS BOX COLD, HARD CASH.\n>> JUST TODAY WE READ ABOUT CLINTON CONFIDENT DOUG\nBRAND, BRAGGING THAT HE HAD FUNNELED TENS OF MILLIONS OF\nDOLLARS TO BILL CLINTON INC. THROUGH THE FOUNDATION\nDONATIONS, PAID SPEECHES, AND CONSULTING CONTRACTS.\n>> DONALD TRUMP IS REFERRING TO THIS LONG MEMO WHICH\nDETAILS THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION AND THEIR MONEY-MAKING OPERATION.\nSIP NICLY DUBBED BILL CLINTON INC. NOT BUT DONALD\nTRUMP YOU BUT BY FORMER CLINTON CONFIDANTE DOUG\nBAND. HE ALLEGED THAT THE FORMER\nPRESIDENT WAS CASHING. IN HE CHARGED THERE WAS A\nSTRATEGY TO STEER DONORS FOR THE CLINTON FOUNDATION TO\nHIRE CLINTON FOR SPEECHES AND CONSULTING CONTRACTS.\nA 2011 MEMO REVEALING THE PLAN, QUOTE, YIELDED MORE\nTHAN $30 MILLION FOR HIM PERSONALLY WITH 66 MILLION\nTO BE PAID OUT LATER. THE EXCLUSIVE NEW EMAIL\nPERHAPS SHEDDING LIGHT ON WHY HILLARY CLINTON PIVOTED\nTO THE GOOD WORK THE FOUNDATION DOES AROUND THE\nWORLD WHEN PRESSED AT THE THIRD AND FINAL PRESIDENTIAL\nDEBATE. >> WHY ISN'T IT WHAT\nMR. TRUMP CALLS PAY-TO-PLAY? >> WELL, EVERYTHING I DID AS\nSECRETARY OF STATE WAS IN FURTHERANCE OF OUR COUNTRY'S\nINTERESTS AND OUR VALUES. >> BAND WROTE THE MEMO AFTER\nCHELSEA CLINTON BLEW THE WHISTLE ON ALLEGATIONS THAT\nHIS CONSULTING COMPANY WAS MAKING MONEY OFF OF ACCESS\nTO HER FATHER. BAND'S DEFENSE?\nBILL CLINTON DID IT TOO. ALLEGING IN ANOTHER EMAIL\nFROM A PREVIOUS WIKILEAKS DUMP THE FOUNDATION\nLITERALLY HAD ABOUT 500 CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.\nSUCH AS A TOP OFFICIAL OWNING A LARGE AMOUNT OF\nSTOCK IN GOLDMAN SAK'S, WHICH IS A MAJOR SPANS SORE\nOF THE CLINTON GLOBAL INITIATIVE.\n>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> BAND FURTHER ALLEGED THE\nFORMER PRESIDENT WAS COLLECTING MONEY FROM AT\nLEAST THREE SPONSORS OF CGI AND HAD ACCEPTED LARGE\nPERSONAL GIFTS AS WELL. THE CLINTON CAMP IS STILL\nREFUSING TO EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE\nWIKILEAKS EMAILS BUT BAND'S COMPANY IS CONFIRMING\nTONIGHT THAT HE WROTE THAT MEMO AND IT'S ACCURATE.\nAND THEY'RE INSISTING THE COMPANY NEVER RECEIVED ANY\nFINANCIAL BENEFIT FROM WORKING WITH THE CHARITY.\n>> ED, THANK YOU. THOSE WIKILEAKS DISCLOSURES\nHAVE BROUGHT INTO FOCUS ONCE MORE THE FACT THAT THE\nCLINTONS PAYMENT VERY RICH IN A VERY SHORT TIME.\nFOR MORE ON THIS WE TURN TO OUR NIGHTLY POLITICAL PANEL,\nNINA EASTON JOURNALIST AT \"FORTUNE MAGAZINE,\" MOLLY\nHEMINGWAY SENIOR EDITOR AT THE FEDERALIST.\nMOLLY, YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THIS.\nTHIS GET THIS OUT IN THE OPEN AND ON THE TABLE AGAIN\nAT A KEY MOMENT IN THE CAMPAIGN.\n>> THIS MEMO MAKES EXPLICIT WHAT WE HAVE KNOWN FOR A\nLONG TIME IS THAT THE CLINTONS HAVE LEVERAGED\nTHEIR FOUNDATION FOR PERSONAL PROFIT AND THAT THE\nFOUNDATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN SORT OF WINDOW CRESSING THAT\nHELPS EXPLAIN WHY WEALTHY PEOPLE BOTH FOREIGN AND\nDOMESTIC IN THE CLINTON ORBIT IT WOULD SEEM UNSEEMLY\nTO HAVE A PRESIDENT OR EXPRESIDENT LOBBIYING ON\nYOUR BEHALF. DOM TOGETHER ON A MISS\nPROMPT AND EMPLOY DOUG BAND TO RESOLVE SOME DISPUTE WITH\nYOUR CHEMICAL COMPANY IN KUWAIT AND NEED A FRIEND IN\nTHE STATE DEPARTMENT. THAT'S CINERGY AND MEANS\nEVERYONE IS WORKING WELL TOGETHER.\nTHIS MAKES IT MORE EXPLICIT. >> WHAT HAPPENS WAS SOME OF\nTHESE PEOPLE WHO GIVE TO THE FOUNDATION OR ENCOURAGE HAVE\nBILL CLINTON MAKE A SPEECH FOR SOME STAGGERING FEE AND\nBEFORE YOU KNOW IT THE CLINTONS ARE RACKING UP\nQUITE A SIGNIFICANT FORTUNE AND NOT A VERY BIG PERIOD OF\nTIME. >> IN THE SHORT TIME.\nHAD THE CLINTON MIND SET THAT I THINK BILL WOULD USE\nHIS POWER AND INFLUENCE AS A WAY TO RAISE A LOT OF MONEY\nFOR THIS FOUNDATION. IT DOESN'T JUST DOOP LITTLE\nTHINGS IT HELPS EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS IN HAITI.\nIT HELPS FARMERS IN AFRICA. HELPS ON THE H.I.V. AIDS\nFRONT. THAT WAS THE MIND SET.\n>> IT'S A REAL FOUNDATION, WE GET THAT.\n>> WHAT THESE MEMOS SHOW IS THAT THERE WAS A PERSONAL\nGAIN OF IN THE ORDER OF TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO\nBILL CLINTON. THE OTHER THING IT SHOWS AND\nKIND EMBELLISHES ON IS THESE OCTOPUS TYPE RELATIONSHIPS\nYOU THAT REFERRED TO, MOLLY. AND DOUG BAND AT THE CENTER\nOF THIS. THE ONE BY THE WAY WHO COMES\nOUT THE BEST IN ALL OF THESE IS CHELSEA CLINTON.\n>> HOW SO? >> WELL, SHE ACCUSED DOUG\nBAND OF TRYING TO PROFIT OFF OF THE FOUNDATION AND TRIES\nTO HER FATHER. AND SHE DID SO -- AND SHE\nWANTED MORE CORPORATE GOVERNOR MAN'S RULES AROUND\nTHE FOUNDATION AND HE CALLED HER AND RETURNED A SPOILED\nBRAT. >> THAT MAY BE SO BUT THE\nONE THING -- SHE DIDN'T CALL HER FATHER AND HER MOTHER ON\nTHE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY WERE PROFITING FROM THE\nFOUNDATION? >> RIGHT.\n>> DOUG BAND, WU KNOW, HE GET CALLED ON THAT AT LEAST\nHE WROTE A MEMO BLOWING A WHISTLE ON SOME OF THIS.\nCHELSEA GETS CREDIT, PERHAPS, FOR CALLING HIM\nOUT. BUT NOBODY CALLED OUT MOM\nAND DAD. >> NO, THEY DIDN'T.\nBUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S CLEAR THAT DOUG BAND AND CHELSEA\nCLINTON ARE REAL LOGGERHEADS AND SHE SAW DOUG BAND AS\nBUILDING HIS CONSULTING FIRM AND GETTING WEALTHY BASED ON\nRUNNING THE FOUNDATION AND TIES.\n>> BECAUSE SHE WAS SUGGESTING THAT MONEY\nSHOULDN'T HAVE GONE TO DOUG BAND BUT TO MOM AND POP.\nMOLLY? >> WHAT'S CEEFL IS THEY\nDON'T HAVE TO DENY GUILT AS FAR AS MUDDYING THE WATERS.\nTHE CLINTONS ARE EXPERTS AT MUDDYING THE WATERS.\nEVERYTHING LOOKS VERY COMPLICATED.\nYOU CAN HAVE SOME LEGITIMACY FOR WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND\nKEEPS THEM HELD ACCOUNTABLE. THIS IS GOING TO BE ONGOING\nISSUE. THIS IS AN ISSUE PEOPLE\nSHOULD KEEP ON LOOKING AT. >> THE CLINTON FOUNDATION\nISN'T GOING TO GO AWAY WHEN BILL BECOMES, IF HE DOES,\nFIRST LADDIE AS HE FIRST DESCRIBED IT AND PRESUMABLY\nHIS SPEECH-MAKING MAY CONTINUE.\n>> AND THE EMAILS ARE GOING TO KEEP COMING OUT AND THERE\nIS GOING TO BE INVESTIGATIONS IN CONGRESS.\nBATTLED INSTRUM MEANT. >> MILL STONE IF ELECTED.\n>> THAT'S WHY THERE WAS SO MUCH PRESSURE AROUND",

WE BEGIN WITH BREAKING NEWS\nFROM, OF ALL PLACES, LaGUARDIA AIRPORT, WHERE THE PLANE\nCARRYING VP CANDIDATE MIKE PENCE SKIDDED OFF THE RUNWAY AND\nSKIDDED RIGHT ON TO SOMETHING CALLED AN ARRESTER BID,\nINSTALLED A DECADE AGO AND DESIGNED TO STOP A JET LINER AT\nTHE END OF A RUNWAY BEFORE IT HITS THE FENCE.\nHAPPILY, THERE WERE NO INJURIES. THE WEATHER HAS BEEN TERRIBLE\nALL DAY IN NEW YORK. THIS IS WHAT RADAR LOOKED LIKE\nTONIGHT. HEAVY RAINS, CHANGEABLE WINDS.\nAND LaGUARDIA RUNWAYS ARE SHORT BY COMMERCIAL STANDARDS.\nTHE CHARTER 737 CARRIED PENCE AND HIS FAMILY, HIS STAFF, A\nCOUPLE OF SHIFTS OF SECRET SERVICE, AND THE NEWS MEDIA.\nPENCE WROTE ON TWITTER HIS THANKS THAT NO ONE WAS HURT.\nALSO THANKED THE FIRST RESPONDERS ON THE SCENE FOR ALL\nTHEY DID. HIS RUNNING MATE AT THE TOP OF\nTHE TICKET, DONALD TRUMP, ALSO COMMENTED AT THE END OF HIS LATE\nRALLY TONIGHT. >> I JUST SPOKE TO OUR FUTURE\nVICE PRESIDENT, AND HE'S OKAY. YOU KNOW, HE WAS IN A BIG\nACCIDENT WITH A PLANE. THE PLANE SKIDDED OFF THE\nRUNWAY, AND WAS PRETTY CLOSE TO GRAVE, GRAVE DANGER.\nBUT I JUST SPOKE TO MIKE PENCE, AND HE'S FINE.\n[ APPLAUSE ] HE GOT OUT, EVERYBODY IS FINE.\nBUT WHAT A GREAT DECISION IT WAS TO GET MIKE PENCE, WHAT A GREAT\nGUY HE IS. WHAT A GREAT JOB HE'S DOING.\n>> DONALD TRUMP AT TONIGHT'S RALLY.\nAMONG THOSE ON THE AIRCRAFT, NBC'S VAUGHN HILLIARD, WHO IS\nOUR CAMPAIGN EMBED COVERING THE PENCE CAMPAIGN.\nWE ARE HAPPY TO SAY HE'S HERE WITH US, VERY MUCH ALIVE AND IN\nTHE STUDIO. VAUGHN, WE ARE GLAD YOU'RE HERE.\nWHEN DID THINGS START TO GO SQUIRRELY?\nI HEAR THAT IT WAS KIND OF A SPORTY LANDING, AND MAYBE IT\nFISH TAILS A LITTLE BIT COMING DOWN THE RUNWAY.\n>> WE KNEW THERE WAS BAD WEATHER, BECAUSE THE FLIGHT WAS\nDELAYED COMING OUT OF IOWA. IT TOOK OFF, THERE WAS AN\nORIGINAL BOUNCE OFF THE TARMAC. THE ODD PART IS THIS HAS BECOME\nNORM WALL THE CAMPAIGN PLANE. WE'VE COME TO EXPECT ROUGH\nLANDINGS WITH THIS PARTICULAR 737.\nBUT IT SWERVED OFF TO THE RIGHT AND YOU'RE LOOKING OUT THE\nWINDOW AND YOU SEE THE ROAD 50, 100 YARDS AND CAME TO A DEAD\nSTOP. THAT'S WHEN WE LOOKED OUT THE\nWINDOW AND YOU COULD SEE THE GAS STATION AND WE REALIZED THIS\nTIME WE WERE OFF THE TARMAC. >> YOU WERE LOOKING RIGHT AT THE\nGRAND CENTRAL PARKWAY. AT LaGUARDIA, IT'S EITHER THE\nHIGHWAY OR THE WATER, SURROUNDED ON ALL SIDES.\nTHUS WHAT LOOKS LIKE THIS CAKED HEAVY SNOW ON THE GROUND, THIS\nIS A KIND OF POROUS CONCRETE THAT DID ITS JOB TONIGHT.\nIT HAS BEEN THERE FOR A DECADE.

SO WHAT ABOUT TRUMP'S WORDING\nTHAT YOU CAME CLOSE TO GRAVE, GRAVE DANGER?\nI SUPPOSE WHILE THIS THING WAS COMING TO A REST, IT MIGHT HAVE\nFELT THIS WAY. >> YOU COULD SMELL THE RUBBER.\nAS WE STARTED TO VEER OFF AND SUDDENLY COME TO THE COMPLETE\nSTAND STILL, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, THE GOVERNOR GOT UP\nQUICKLY, HE CAME TO THE BACK, WANTED TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY\nWAS OKAY. TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, THE\nCAMPAIGN AND THE STAFF HAVE GOTTEN USED TO THESE ROUGH\nLANDINGS. HE CAME BACK, EVERYBODY WAS\nSAFE. THEN YOU SEE THE FIREFIGHTERS\nCOME ON TO THE PLANE SAYING EVERYBODY PLEASE GET OFF AND\nTHAT'S WHERE YOU'RE SEEING EVERYTHING THAT IS TORN UP AND\nYOU SEE THE ROAD AND I BELIEVE THAT GAS STATION OVER THERE.\nTHAT'S WHEN IT WAS REALITY THAT WE WERE CLOSE TO SOMETHING A\nLITTLE BIT MORE SERIOUS. >> AS MUCH AS I HATE TO SAY IT,\nIT'S WRITTEN ABOUT SPORADICALLY, THE FACT THAT PER CAPITA, WE'VE\nLOST A LOT OF POLITICIANS AND ROCK STARS, AND WHAT THEIR\nDEATHS OFTEN HAVE IN COMMON, CHARTER AIRCRAFT, WE GOT A LATE\nEVENT, WE CAN RUSH THE WEATHER. IT HAPPENS.\nYOU GUYS ARE LIVING IN THE AIR THESE DAYS.\n>> NEBRASKA TO IOWA TO NEW YORK. TOMORROW, NORTH CAROLINA, NEW\nHAMPSHIRE. WE'RE UP AND DOWN CONSTANTLY ON\nTHIS PLANE. >> HAVE YOU CALLED HOME IF >> I\nCALLED HOME. I TOLD THEM WE HAD TO GET THE\nCAMERA SET UP FIRST. >> HE'S FINE.\nHE LOOKS LIKE A MILLION BUCKS.

ONLY THING WORSE IS THE WAY I'M\nBEING TREATED. HEY, IT IS RECORD-SETTING BAD\nTREATMENT WHAT I'M GETTING, THE GREATEST PILE-ON ON AMERICAN\nHISTORY. I GO TO THE RALLIES AND THEY'RE\nSTARTING TO HATE THE MEDIA BECAUSE THEY SEE IT IS ALL A BIG\nLIE. NOT ALL, BUT A LOT IS A BIG LIE.\n>> WE CONTINUE WITH FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE NEWT\nGINGRICH. THE GREATEST PILE-ON IN HISTORY.\nIN MANY WAYS WE DISCUSSED FOR EXAMPLE, LAST NIGHT WE LEARNED\nFROM WIKILEAKS A LOT OF THE REPORTERS, MAINSTREAM MEDIA ARE\nBEING WINED AND DINED BY THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN, AND THIS IS\nFROM ABC, ASSOCIATED PRESS, BLOOM BURG, CNN, MSNBC,\nPOLITICO, THE \"WALL STREET JOURNAL.\"\nI NEVER GOT THE INVITATION. DID YOU GET ONE?\nI NEVER HAVE BEEN INVITED TO ANY OF THESE THINGS.\n>> WELL, I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BE EITHER.\n>> I DON'T WANT TO BE, I REALLY DON'T WANT.\n>> I DON'T THINK -- I DON'T THINK THE CLINTONS HAVE YOU ON\nTHEIR LIST OF POSSIBLE ALLIES. >> LET ME TELL YOU, I HAVE NEVER\nBEEN TO MAR-A-LAGO, NEVER STAYED IN A TRUMP HOTEL OR BEEN TO A\nTRUMP GOLF COURSE AND NEVER BEEN INVITED THERE.\nEVERYONE HATES ME I GUESS. WHAT IS UP WITH THAT?\nI'M BEGINNING TO GET A COMPLEX. >> I DON'T KNOW, YOU KNOW, I'M\nCONFIDENT IF YOU ASKED DONALD WOULD GET YOU ON A GOLF COURSE.\n>> I'LL PAY MY WAY. I DON'T NEED ANY --\n>> I DON'T KNOW -- THAT'S RIGHT, YOU'RE DOING FINE.\nA COUPLE OF QUICK THINGS SO THE AUDIENCE GETS THE FULL FLAVOR OF\nTHIS, AND LET ME SAY BY THE WAY BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO\nCOVER LATER ON IN A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE SHOW, THE\nNEW DEAL FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND FOR THE BLACK COMMUNITY IS A\nREALLY BIG IDEA. DONALD TRUMP HAS DONE MORE TO\nCOMMUNICATE CONCERN AND TO COMMUNICATE SOLUTIONS TO THE\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY THAN ANY REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATE IN MY LIFETIME, AND THE SPEECH YESTERDAY WAS A BIG\nDEAL. I KNOW IT IS GOING TO BE ON\nLATER ON THE SHOW TONIGHT. I WANT TO TELL YOU I THINK\nPEOPLE SHOULD NOTE HOW MANY THINGS HE IS SAYING AND DOING\nTHAT ARE SUBSTANTIVE. HIS CONTRACT WITH THE AMERICAN\nVOTER, WHICH AGAIN AS THE GUY WHO WROTE THE CONTRACT WITH\nAMERICA I'M VERY SYMPATHETIC WITH CONTRACTS.\nIT IS A GREAT CONTRACT. EVERYBODY SHOULD GO LOOK AT IT\nAND SHOULD SEE AT THE WEBSITE FOR THE CONTRACT THAT, IN FACT,\nTHIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S REAL, IT IS SPECIFIC, IT IS TOTALLY\nDIFFERENT FROM WHERE HILLARY CLINTON WOULD TAKE US.\nI THINK THESE ARE BIG BREAKTHROUGHS, BUT YOU'RE NOT\nGOING TO SEE MUCH OF IT IN THE ELITE MEDIA BECAUSE IT IS ALL\nPOSITIVE. >> I ACTUALLY HAVE -- AND THIS\nIS ACTUALLY SIGNED BY TRUMP, THIS IS HIS CONTRACT WITH\nAMERICA. NOW, HE TALKS ABOUT SIX MEASURES\nTO CLEAN UP CORRUPTION, DRAIN THE SWAMP AS HE CALLS IT,\nSPECIAL INTERESTS. SEVEN ACTIONS TO PROTECT\nAMERICAN WORKERS. FIVE ACTIONS TO RESTORE SECURITY\nAND CONSTITUTIONAL RULE OF LAW. MIDDLE CLASS TAX SIMPLIFICATION,\nENDING -- END THE OFF-SHORING ACT, AMERICAN ENERGY AND\nINFRASTRUCTURE ACT, REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE ACT,\nAFFORDABLE CHILD CARE AND ELDER CARE ACT, END THE ILLEGAL\nIMMIGRATION ACT, RESTORING COMMUNITY SAFETY ACT, RESTORING\nNATIONAL SECURITY ACT AND CLEANING UP CORRUPTION IN\nWASHINGTON. THERE ARE TWO PAGES.\nI PUT IT UP ON MY WEBSITE, HANNITY.COM, AND PEOPLE SAY HE'S\nNOT SUBSTANTIVE. THEY DON'T WANT TO COVER THE\nSUBSTANCE OF DONALD TRUMP. THEY DON'T WANT TO COVER THIS.\nMAYBE HE NEEDS TO DO WHAT YOU DID WHEN YOU WERE RUNNING, PULL\nIT OUT OF HIS POCKET IN EVERY INTERVIEW AND SAY, THIS IS WHAT\nI'M GOING TO DO, I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT A, BAND C, WHAT YOU\nWANT TO TALK ABOUT. >> I THINK HE SHOULD PROBABLY\nHOLD IT UP AT EVERY SINGLE RALLY AND TELL PEOPLE THEY CAN GO TO\nHIS WEBSITE AND SIGN UP, AND THEY CAN BE PART OF THIS\nCONTRACT BETWEEN HIM AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\nI THINK, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE WE DID IT AND HE KNOWS HOW WE DID\nIT, HE KNOWS WE KEPT OUR WORD, HE KNOWS WE VOTED ON EVERY\nSINGLE THING IN THE 1994 CONTRACT WITH AMERICA.\nI THINK HE'S TRYING TO MAKE A CASE HERE THAT HE IS REALLY\nCOMMITTED TO VERY, VERY DRAMATIC CHANGE.\nI THINK IT IS PATHETIC THAT THE \"NEW YORK TIMES,\" \"THE\nWASHINGTON POST\" ET CETERA, NBC, CBS, ABC, NONE OF THESE GUYS CAN\nSERVE AMERICA BY LETTING THEM SEE THAT THERE IS A REAL\nALTERNATIVE. I MEAN IT IS ALMOST UNPATRIOTIC\nTO HAVE THE LEVEL OF DELIBERATE DISINFORMATION AND DLIB\nSENSORSHIP WE ARE GETTING OUT OF THE ELITE MEDIA.\nI THINK IT IS SOMETHING THE AVERAGE AMERICAN GETS.\nONE OF THE REASONS YOU'RE GETTING HUGE VOTER TURNOUTS I\nTHINK IS TO SEND A SIGNAL TO THE NEWS MEDIA, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO\nDICTATE TO US WE HAVE TO VOTE FOR SOME CORRUPT LEFT WINGER,\nWE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU. I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO FIND\nSOME VERY SURPRISING RESULTS THIS FALL.\n>> ALL RIGHT. CAN ONLY HOPE SO.\n12 DAYS TO GO, MR. SPEAKER. APPRECIATE YOU BEING WITH US.\nCOMING UP, NEWLY RELEASED WIKILEAKS E-MAIL SHOW THAT\nCLINTON AIDES WERE SHOCKED AND APPALLED BY HILLARY'S PRIVATE\nE-MAIL SERVER.

NOW, AS ED JUST TOLD US A FEW\nMOMENTS AGO, ONE E-MAIL RELEASED WAS FROM THE PRESIDENT FOR THE\nCENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS, THE CO-CHAIR, OF COURSE, IS\nCLINTON'S TRANSITION TEAM, NEERA TANDEN.\nSHE WROTE BACK IN JULY, DO WE KNOW WHO TOLD HILLARY SHE COULD\nUSE A PRIVATE E-MAIL AND HAS THAT PERSON BEEN DRAWN AND\nQUARTERED? LIKE THIS WHOLE THING IS INSANE.\nI DIDN'T SAY THE OTHER WORD. JOINING US WITH REACTION IS\nAUTHOR OF \"UNHOLY ALLIANCE\" FROM THE AMERICAN FOR CENTER OF LAW\nAND JUSTICE, JAY SEC LOAN, AND WASHINGTON EXAMINER CONTRIBUTOR,\nBY THE WAY PART OF THE FOX NEWS FAMILY, LISA BOOTHE WITH US.\nGOOD TO SEE YOU BOTH. >> HI, SEAN.\n>> HI, SEAN. >> JOY, I HAVE NOT SENSED FROM\nYOU REAL ENTHUSIASM FOR TRUMP. WHY?\n>> WELL, I JUST THINK THAT THE CAMPAIGN HAS MISSED THE ISSUES.\nTHAT'S BEEN -- SEAN, YOU AND I HAVE BEEN -- I AM AN ISSUES\nPERSON AND I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE ISSUES BEING ADDRESSED AND I\nDON'T THINK IT'S BEEN ARTICULATED PARTICULARLY\nSTRONGLY BY DONALD TRUMP. NOW, THAT'S NOT TO SAY --\n>> WAIT A MINUTE. >> -- THE MEDIA HASN'T BEEN --\n>> IN FAIRNESS TO HIM THOUGH, I THINK THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT\nINVOLVES THE NARRATIVE OR THE NEWS MEDIA.\nHE CAME OUT WITH TRUMP'S CONTRACT WITH AMERICA.\n>> ABSOLUTELY. >> DETAILED, SUBSTANTIVE.\nI WILL GIVE YOU SOME OF THE DETAILS.\nWE KNOW HE IS GOING TO DROP THE CORPORATE TAX RATE DOWN TO 15%.\nWE KNOW HE'S GOING TO EXTREMELY VET REFUGEES, WE KNOW HE IS\nGOING TO BUILD A WALL. ELIMINATE, REPLACE OBAMACARE AND\nHEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNTS. WE KNOW HE WILL SAY RADICAL\nISLAM, AND YOU SAW THE LIST OF SUPREME COURT JUSTICES.\n>> YEAH. >> THAT'S A LIST NEAR AND DEAR\nTO YOUR HEART. >> YES.\n>> SO HELP ME OUT HERE. >> SO WHAT YOU JUST DID, WHAT\nYOU JUST DID, SEAN, IS VERY EFFECTIVE.\nTHE PROBLEM IS -- AND PART OF IT IS THE MEDIA BUT PART OF IT IS\nBEING -- YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU HAVE TO GIVE A MESSAGE, YOU HAVE TO\nMAKE YOUR THREE POINTS AND STICK TO IT NO MATTER WHAT IS COMING\nAT YOU. WHAT I HAVE SEEN IN THE\nCAMPAIGN -- BY THE WAY I THINK IT IS WAY TOO CLOSE TO CALL, AND\nI THINK DONALD TRUMP UNDER POLLS.\nI THINK THE FACT IS YOU HAVE THREE OR FOUR MAJOR POINTS YOU\nWANT TO MAKE, YOU RATTLED THEM OFF VERY SUCCINCTLY, BUT HE\nTENDS TO GET DISTRACTED. THAT'S THE THING IN A\nPRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, LIKE A SUPREME COURT ARGUMENT, NEVER\nLET THEM GET YOU DISTRACTED. >> MAYBE THAT'S TRUE.\nI'VE BEEN ON RADIO 30 YEARS, IT IS MY 21st YEAR ON FOX.\nTHIS IS WHAT I DO. HE IS A BUSINESS GUY.\nI'M NOT SURE THAT THE PUBLIC, THE VOTING PUBLIC -- LISA, JUMP\nIN HERE -- IS GOING TO JUDGE HIM ON THE STANDARD OF WHETHER HE\nCAN RATTLE OFF, YOU KNOW, EXACTLY HIS AGENDA IN 30 SECONDS\nLIKE A PROFESSIONAL TALK SHOW HOST COULD.\n>> LOOK, I THINK PART OF DONALD TRUMP'S APPEAL TO VOTERS IS THE\nFACT THAT HE DOESN'T SPEAK LIKE HILLARY CLINTON, THE FACT THAT\nHE SEES A LITTLE BIT MORE PLAIN SPOKEN, LIKE AN AVERAGE PERSON\nWOULD, AND THEY FIND HILLARY CLINTON REHEARSED.\nTHAT'S PART OF THE INAUTHENTICITY AND THE REASON\nAMERICANS DON'T TRUST HER. I DO THINK IT WOULD BE TO DONALD\nTRUMP'S BENEFIT, ESPECIALLY RIGHT NOW WITH ALL OF THIS\nINFORMATION THAT HAS COME OUT REGARDING WIKILEAKS, WHETHER IT\nIS THE FACT THAT BILL CLINTON PERSONALLY MADE $66 MILLION OFF\nOF SOURCES THAT WERE TIED TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, ESSENTIALLY\nLEVERAGING THOSE RELATIONSHIPS TO MAKING THE CLINTONS\nPERSONALLY RICH. THAT GIVES A LOT OF NEW LIGHT\nWHEN YOU REMEMBER THAT THE APP HAD REPORTED NOT TOO LONG AGO\nMORE THAN HALF OF HILLARY CLINTON'S NON-GOVERNMENT\nMEETINGS WERE CLINTON FOUNDATION DONORS.\nSO THERE'S SO MUCH INFORMATION HERE TO UNPACK, AND I CERTAINLY\nBELIEVE IT IS TO DONALD TRUMP'S BENEFIT TO START UNPACKING IT\nFOR AMERICA. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT.\nJAY, THEY'RE ADMITTING THEY KNOW THAT THIS ENTIRE ISSUE IS\nCORRUPT. >> YES.\n>> IN ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT E-MAILS THAT WENT BACK AND\nFORTH, THEY KNEW IT WAS -- >> INCREDIBLY.\n>> -- THEY KNEW THE CLINTON FOUNDATION AND UNDERSTOOD IT.\n>> HERE IS THE REAL ISSUE. THE STAFF BECAUSE OF WIKILEAKS,\nTHE STAFF REPORTING OF WHAT WAS GOING ON INTERNALLY INSIDE OF\nTHE CAMPAIGN IS MADE PUBLIC FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD TO SEE.\nIT IS NOT A COMPLICATED CONNECT-THE-DOTS.\nTHE FACT IS WHAT WAS GOING ON, I MEAN YOU MENTIONED THE FBI\nSITUATION. I MEAN THE FBI SHOULD BE\nEMBARRASSED. NOW THE NUMBER TWO GUY AT THE\nFBI GETS PROMOTED AFTER ALL OF THIS MESS, HIS WIFE WAS RUNNING\nTO BE A STATE SENATE SEAT, AND THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA POURS\nIN BETWEEN THE DNC AND PACKs 700,000, $800,000 FOR A STATE\nSENATE SEAT HE LOSES AND HE GETS PROMOTED.\nI MEAN LOOK, NONE OF THIS -- SEAN, IN ANOTHER UNIVERSE AT\nANOTHER TIME, THIS WOULD BE A VERY DIFFERENT SITUATION.\nBUT I GO BACK TO STAY ON MESSAGE.\nYOU'RE COMING UP TO THE MOST IMPORTANT TEN DAYS OF THE\nPRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. THIS IS IT, THE FINAL TEN DAYS\nIS JUST TWO DAYS AWAY, FOR BOTH CLINTON AND FOR TRUMP.\nTHEY'VE GOT TO HIT THEIR MESSAGES.\nIF YOU'RE A TRUMP SUPPORTER, YOU WANT HIM HITTING EXACTLY WHAT\nYOU HIT CONSISTENTLY. NOT GET DISTRACTED BY OTHER\nTHINGS. IF YOU ARE A CLINTON SUPPORTER,\nSAME THING. FOCUS ON WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO\nGO. IF THEY DON'T FOCUS THOUGH,\nTHAT'S THE PROBLEM, AND DONALD TRUMP HAS NOT BEEN FOCUSED.\n>> LAST WORD, LISA. >> WELL, I AGREE.\nI DO THINK THAT HE REALLY NEEDS TO STAY FOCUSED BECAUSE THERE\nARE INDICATIONS THAT THIS RACE IS TIGHTENING.\nWHAT WE'VE SEEN THROUGHOUT THIS ELECTION IS THE FACT IT'S BEEN\nVERY FLUID. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF EBBS AND\nFLOWS. THAT BEING SAID, 12 DAYS OUT\nFROM THE ELECTION. THERE'S NO TIME LEFT FOR\nSCREW-UPS. HE CANNOT SAY SOMETHING STUPID,\nCANNOT DISTRACT THE MEDIA'S ATTENTION AWAY FROM THINGS LIKE\nTHE DOUG BAND MEMO, THE WIKILEAKS INFORMATION THAT\nSURFACED, THE FACT PRESIDENT OBAMA MAY HAVE KNOWN ABOUT HER\nPRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER ALL ALONG. THESE ARE THINGS HE NEEDS TO\nALLOW THE MEDIA TO STAY FOCUSED ON, AND HE CANNOT OFFER ANY\nDISTRACTION BY GETTING OFF MESSAGE OR SAYING ANYTHING\nSTUPID. >> RIGHT.\n>> SO IT IS REALLY VITAL TERRITORY RIGHT NOW, SEAN.\n>> ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU BOTH.\nAPPRECIATE IT. UP NEXT TONIGHT, RIGHT HERE\n\"HANNITY.\"",

BUT HE IS CONCENTRATING ON THE\nAREA OF WEAKNESS AND THE AREA THAT WE NEED TO STRENGTHEN\nBECAUSE WE ONLY HAVE 330 MILLION PEOPLE.\n>> IF YOU LOOK AT THE EIGHT OBAMA YEARS, AND I TALK ABOUT\nTHE HORRIBLE ECONOMIC STATISTICS, DOUBLING OF THE\nDEBT, ONE IN FIVE AMERICAN FAMILIES NOBODY IS WORKING, 13\nMILLION MORE AMERICANS ON FOOD STAMPS, EIGHT MILLION MORE IN\nPOVERTY. BLACK AND HISPANICS HAVE\nDISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY THE POLICY, BUT INNER CITY\nAMERICA, IN COME THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND, BY THE WAY, THE\nREPUBLICANS ARE RACIST, DON'T VOTE FOR THEM.\n>> RIGHT. >> SAME STRATEGY, NO IMPACT IN\nTHEIR LIVES. >> WHAT WE'RE MOST HURT BY IS\nILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, WORKING CLASS LATINOS, WE'RE THE ONES\nNEGATIVELY IMPACTED. I WROTE ABOUT IT TWO AND A HALF\nYEARS AGO IN NATIONAL REVIEW. IT IS AFRICAN-AMERICANS WHO ARE\nVICTIMS OF AMNESTY. WHEN THEY SEE HIGHER COMPETITION\nFOR JOBS, LOWER WAGES BECAUSE OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.\nNOT ENOUGH ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO THE FACT DONALD TRUMP'S\nPLATFORM FOR THAT REASON ALONE A PRO AFRICAN-AMERICAN PLATFORM.\n>> THIS IS THE KEY QUESTION. WHY EVERY FOUR YEARS,\nDISPROPORTIONATELY, THERE WAS A RASMUSSEN POLL OUT OCTOBER 25th,\nTRUMP HAS 16% SUPPORT FROM BLACK AMERICANS, ALMOST TRIPLE THE\nAMOUNT MITT ROMNEY HAD. WHY STILL SUCH A LOW NUMBER?\nIN OTHER WORDS DEMOCRATS SEEM TO HAVE A LOCK, A MONOPOLY ON THESE\nDEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS. WHY?\n>> BECAUSE OF THE MEDIA NOISE. THEY REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE\nSOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS, LISTEN, YOUR COMMUNITIES, YOUR NEED\nJOBS, YOU NEED LESS COMPETITION, HIGHER WAGES.\nAMNESTY IS HURTING YOU. BUSINESS REGULATION THAT DONALD\nTRUMP WANTS TO DO AWAY WITH IS HURTING YOU.\nBAD TRADE DEALS ARE WHAT IS HURTING YOU.\nWHEN YOU VOTE TRUMP, YOU'RE VOTING FOR YOURSELF.\nA VOTE FOR TRUMP IS A VOTE FOR HELPING THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nCOMMUNITY. IT IS A FACT, INDISPUTEABLE.\n>> WHAT DO YOU THINK, DR. CARSON?\nYOU LOOK AT THE POLLS, WE SEE THE BALLS IN THE AIR, WIKILEAKS,\nMORE PROJECT VERITAS. MY QUESTION TO YOU IS DO YOU\nBELIEVE THESE POLLS ARE WRONG? DO YOU THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE\nA BREXIT EFFECT? DO YOU THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE\nTHAT WON'T ADMIT THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP?\nYOU'RE OUT WITH HIM ON A PRETTY REGULAR BASIS.\n>> YES, I DO BELIEVE THAT THE POLLS ARE SKEWED, YOU KNOW.\nONE OF THE POLLS LAST WEEK, I THINK IT WAS ABC, HAD HILLARY 12\nPOINTS AHEAD, BUT THEY ONLY POLLED 29% REPUBLICANS.\nIF THEY POLLED 29% DEMOCRATS THEY WOULD HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT\nNUMBER. THEY TEND NOT TO TALK ABOUT, YOU\nKNOW, IBD AND RASMUSSEN AND THE ONES THAT LOOK GOOD FOR TRUMP.\nTHAT SEEMS TO BE UNIVERSAL AMONGST THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA.\nI THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE, AND PARTICULARLY IN THE BLACK\nCOMMUNITY, IF YOU ASK THEM WHO THEY'RE VOTING FOR THEY'RE NOT\nGOING TO SAY TRUMP BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THEY DON'T TRUST YOU, THEY\nDON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE, AND THERE'S SUCH NEGATIVE\nRAMIFICATIONS FOR THEM. IN THE WHITE COMMUNITY, THEY\nFREQUENTLY DON'T WANT TO SAY IT BECAUSE IF YOU VOTE FOR TRUMP\nYOU'RE A RACIST, THAT'S THE NARRATIVE THAT'S BEEN PUT FORTH.\nOF COURSE, IT IS FULL OF CRAP BUT THAT IS WHAT IS PUT FORTH\nOUT THERE. >> I LOVE YOU WAY FULL OF CRAP.\nNOW YOU SOUND LIKE ME. TALK SHOW HOST IN YOUR FUTURE.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK, A.J.? >> THERE'S AN INTIMIDATION\nFACTOR THAT PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO ADMIT THEY'RE VOTING FOR TRUMP.\nWE'RE SEEING IT COMING OUT IN FLORIDA.\nWE ARE SEEING IN EARLY VOTING DONALD TRUMP IS UP.\nTHAT'S PROOF POSITIVE THE POLLS ARE WRONG.\n>> GOT TO GET FLORIDA, OHIO, NORTH CAROLINA, GOT TO MAKE SURE\nHE GETS UTAH, WHICH IS AMAZING, ARIZONA, NEVADA, AND THEN HE HAS\nTO PICK UP, YOU KNOW, NEW HAMPSHIRE, INCLUDING INDIANA AND\nHE ALSO HAS TO GET IOWA. HE HAS A TOUGH --\n>> IT IS GOING TO BE TOUGH. PEOPLE KNOW HE'S OUR CHAMPION\nAND THEY'RE GOING THE CAST THE BALLOT ON NOVEMBER 8th.\n>> THANK YOU BOTH. UP NEXT TONIGHT RIGHT HERE ON\n\"HANNITY.\"",

I MEAN, HOW IS HE GOING TO DEAL\nWITH ANY MAJOR CRISIS OF OUR NATION IF THERE IS ONE, IF HE'S\nSITTING IN A DEPOSITION AND TRYING TO DEFEND THE LAWSUITS,\nWHICH, BY THE WAY, MIGHT BE FILED AGAINST HIM OR IF HE DOES\nFILE AGAINST THE WOMEN WOULD HE MIGHT FACE A LAWSUIT THEN, A\nCROSS COMPLAINT, BECAUSE HE'S ALLEGED ACTIONS THAT ARE, HE'S\nALLEGED THAT THEY HAVE DEFAMED HIM, AND THEY MAY ALLEGE THAT HE\nDEFAMED THEM, BY CALLING THEM LIARS, BY SAYING THEIR CLAIMS\nARE FABRICATION, THAT IT'S FICTION.\nBE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR, MR. TRUMP, BECAUSE YOU JUST\nMIGHT GET IT. >> LET ME GET YOUR REACTION TO\nTHIS LATEST THREAT ISSUED IN THE LAST HOUR AND A HALF OF SUING\nNBC FOR THE RELEASE OF THE ACCESSION HOLLYWOOD VIDEO.\nCAN YOU SEE ANY CAUSE OF ACTION IN THAT?\n>> WELL, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL THE TRUE FACTS ARE,\nLAWRENCE. AND I CERTAINLY DON'T GET MY\nFACTS FROM DONALD TRUMP. GIVEN THE LIST OF LIES THAT HE\nHAS SAID ABOUT SO MANY PEOPLE, THEY'RE ALL LISTED ON THE\nINTERNET, I MEAN, YOU CAN'T EVEN KEEP UP WITH THEM.\nSO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE KNEW THAT HIS MIC WAS HOT.\nI DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CONTRACTS SAY, IF ANYTHING, ABOUT WHETHER,\nWHAT HE WAS SAYING WHEN HE WAS MIKED, COULD BE USED AT ANY\nOTHER TIME. I DON'T KNOW HOW THOSE TAPES\nULTIMATELY BECAME PUBLIC, WHETHER NBC HAD ANYTHING TO DO\nWITH THEM, HOW IT CAME INTO POSSESSION OF SOMEONE.\nTHESE ARE JUST UNKNOWN FACTS, SO I CAN'T SPECULATE.\nUNLIKE DONALD TRUMP, UNLESS I HAVE THE TRUE FACTS, I DON'T\nDRAW CONCLUSIONS. BUT WHY DON'T YOU, NBC, JUST SAY\nGAME ON, DONALD TRUMP, IF THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS TO DO, IF HE WANTS\nTO FIGHT IT OUT IN A LAWSUIT, OKAY, HE'LL FIGHT IT OUT IN A\nLAWSUIT. >> QUICKLY BEFORE WE GO, WHAT\nWOULD BE YOUR DEFENSE STRATEGY IF DONALD TRUMP DID FILE ONE OF\nTHESE LAWSUITS? >> WELL, I CAN TELL YOU THAT\nHE'S NOT GOING TO MAKE WOMEN COWER.\nTHOSE DAYS OF BULLYING WOMEN, AND MANY WOMEN ARE STILL BEING\nBULLIED AT HOME, IN THEIR WORKPLACE, IN THEIR COMMUNITY,\nAND WE'RE JUST NOT GOING TO TAKE IT ANYMORE.\nTHESE WOMEN, IF THEY ARE SUED BY DONALD TRUMP, AT LEAST THE ONES\nTHAT I REPRESENT, WE HAVE A, I'M GOING TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND THEM.\nWE HAVE ARMIES OF ATTORNEYS WHO ARE GOING TO BE AVAILABLE TO\nEVEN REPRESENT PERHAPS THOSE WOMEN THAT I DON'T REPRESENT.\nTHERE'S GOING TO BE A WELL-FUNDED DEFENSE.\nSO ALL YOUR ATTEMPTS TO MAKE WOMEN COWER IN FEAR, MR.

      "text": "BANNON, CEO OF THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN TOLD BLOOMBERG BUSINESS WEEK, TRUMP IS A BUILDER, AND\nWHAT HE'S BUILT IS THE APPARATUS TO DOMINATE REPUBLICAN POLITICS\nAFTER THAT. AND WHAT IF IT DOESN'T PROPEL\nDONALD TRUMP TO VICTORY? WILL THE REPUBLICAN MACHINE\nSTILL DOMINATE POLITICS? WILL THEY TRY TO CREATE A NEW\nPARTY, AN INDEPENDENT PARTY THAT WOULD WAGE WAR ON BOTH THE\nDEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN PARTIES? AS MUCH AS DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO\nDENY THE VALIDITY OF ALL THE POLLS THAT SHOW HIM LOSING.\nONE TRUMP STAFFER TOLD BLOOMBERG BUSINESS WEEK NATE SILVER'S\nRESULTS HAVE BEEN SIMILAR TO OURS, THAT TRUMP CAMPAIGN\nSTAFFER CONFIRMED THAT TRUMP'S OWN POLLING SHOWS HIM LOSING IN\nTHE SAME WAY THAT NATE SILVER'S PROJECTIONS SHOW DONALD TRUMP\nLOSING. SO WHEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN LOOKS\nAT THOSE POLLS, WHAT DO THEY REALLY EXPECT TO BE DOING ON\nNOVEMBER 9th? THE BLOOMBERG ARTICLE REPORTS BY\nELECTION DAY, THE CAMPAIGN EXPECTS TO HAVE CAPTURED 12\nMILLION TO 14 MILLION E-MAIL ADDRESSES AND CONTACT\nINFORMATION INCLUDING CREDIT CARD NUMBERS FOR 2.5 MILLION\nSMALL-DOLLAR DONORS WHO TOGETHER WILL HAVE PONIED UP ALMOST $275\nMILLION. I WOULDN'T HAVE COME ABOARD EVEN\nFOR TRUMP IF I HADN'T KNOWN THEY WERE BUILDING THIS MASSIVE\nFACEBOOK AND DATA ENGINE, SAYS BANNON.\nFACEBOOK IS WHAT PROPELLED BREITBART TO A MASSIVE AUDIENCE.\nWE KNOW ITS POWER. IF HILLARY CLINTON IS PRESIDENT\nAND IS TRYING TO FILL A VACANCY ON THE SUPREME COURT, WHAT WILL\nTHE TRUMP/BANNON MACHINE DO? WHAT WILL THEY TELL REPUBLICANS\nTO DO? YESTERDAY TED CRUZ RAISED THE\nPOSSIBILITY THAT A REPUBLICAN SENATE WILL SIMPLY NEVER CONFIRM\nA SUPREME COURT JUSTICE APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT OBAMA\nWHOSE LATEST APPOINTMENT THEY'VE DELAYED FOR ALMOST A YEAR OR BY\nA NEW PRESIDENT CLINTON? HE SAID THERE IS CERTAINLY LONG\nHISTORICAL PRECEDENT FOR A SUPREME COURT WITH FEWER\nJUSTICES. I WOULD NOTE RECENTLY, THAT\nJUSTICE BREYER NOTED THAT IT HAS NOT LIMITED THE COURT ON DOING\nITS JOB. JOINING US NOW, ONE WHO CO-WROTE\nTHAT PIECE. AND ALSO SENIOR EDITOR FOR THE\nATLANTIC. WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT IT IN\nTHE BEGINNING OF THE SHOW, YOUR ARTICLE TONIGHT, BUT THIS, THIS\nMASSIVE DATABASE THAT THEY HAVE BUILT, ISN'T THERE NOW SOME\nDISPUTE AS TO WHO OWNS THAT INFORMATION?\nWHAT IS OWNED BY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND WHAT IS OWNED BY THE\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN AND OWNED BY DONALD TRUMP?\n>> YEAH, THERE ARE A FEW DIFFERENT TYPES OF DATA, AND A\nFEW DIFFERENT LISTS. AND THEY HAVE SORT OF DIFFERENT\nPROVIDENCES AND DIFFERENT OWNERSHIP.\nTHERE'S APPROXIMATELY 2.5 MILLION SMALL DONORS YOU\nMENTIONED. THEY GAVE MONEY JOINTLY TO THE\nRNC AND TRUMP CAMPAIGN, AND BOTH ENTITIES HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE\nNAMES. THERE'S ANOTHER LIST THAT THE\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN ESTIMATES WILL BE ANOTHER 10 MILLION OR SO NAMES\nBY ELECTION DAY, THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T GIVEN MONEY\nBUT HAVE SIGNED UP, GIVEN AN E-MAIL ADDRESS OR CELL PHONE\nNUMBER FOR MOBILE COMMUNICATION. THESE ARE SUPPORTERS WHO'VE\nSIGNED UP AS ACTIVISTS. THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN ALONE PAID TO\nADVERTISE AND BUILD THAT LIST. AND OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN OWNS THAT LIST AND THE RNC HAS NO CLAIM TO\nIT. >> DAVID FROM, I DON'T WANT TO\nSUGGEST THAT THIS CAMPAIGN IS OVER, THIS ELECTION IS OVER.\nTHERE'S A DISTINCT POSSIBILITY DONALD TRUMP COULD WIN THIS.\nIT'S STILL PRESENT, BUT, FOR THE MOMENT, LET'S ANTICIPATE A WORLD\nIN WHICH DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T WIN, AND YOU HAVE THIS TEAM\nTOGETHER, WITH ALL THIS INFORMATION THAT THEY'VE\nGATHERED. IN POLITICAL TERMS, WHAT WOULD\nYOU EXPECT THEM TO USE IT FOR? WOULD YOU EXPECT THEM FOR\nEXAMPLE TO INSIST THAT IF IT'S A REPUBLICAN SENATE NO SUPREME\nCOURT JUSTICE GETS CONFIRMED FOR FOUR YEARS?\n>> I WANT TO HONOR SASHA'S AMAZING REPORTING.\nIT'S NOT A CRITICISM OF HIM AND HIS WORK TO SUGGEST THAT HIS\nSORTS ARE DELUDING THEMSELVES ABOUT THE POWER OF WHAT THEY'VE\nPUT TOGETHER. WHEN DONALD, SHOULD HE LOSE AND\nSHOULD HE LOSE AS BIG AS HE'S GOING TO, THERE IS GOING TO BE A\nSCORCHED EARTH PERIOD OF RECRIMINATION AND DONALD TRUMP\nWILL BE THE TARGET OF THE RECRIMINATIONS AND THE PEOPLE\nAROUND HIM WILL BE THE TARGET OF THE RECRIMINATION.\nAND AS WE DISCOVER, HOW MUCH SELF-DEALING THERE HAS BEEN, HOW\nBADLY THE CAMPAIGN WAS RUN, AND HOW EVERYONE WAS PREPARING THEIR\nPARACHUTES, THERE'S GOING TO BE A REVULSION AGAINST THIS CREW.\nI DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE THE CLOUT THEY IMAGINE.\nIMAGINE HOW TRUE IT WILL BE IF PEOPLE ARE UNSUCCESSFUL.\nI THINK WE WILL DISCOVER WE'RE IN A NEW TERRAIN WITH NEW\nPERSONALITIES AND NEW ISSUES DRIVEN BY OPPOSITION TO THE\nHILLARY CLINTON ADMINISTRATION SHOULD THERE BE ONE.\n>> LET'S LISTEN TO WHAT JOHN McCAIN SAID IN A RADIO INTERVIEW\nABOUT THE SUPREME COURT. >> I PROMISE YOU, THAT WE WILL,\nWE WILL BE UNITED AGAINST ANY SUPREME COURT NOMINEE THAT\nHILLARY CLINTON, IF SHE WERE PRESIDENT WILL PUT UP.\nI PROMISE YOU. >> SASHA, THE REASON I WANT YOU\nTO HEAR THAT IS I DON'T SEE ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TED CRUZ AND\nJOHN McCAIN ON THIS ISSUE. AND I THINK WE KNOW WHERE A\nBREITBART INSPIRED TRUMP ENTITY WOULD BE ON ISSUES LIKE THAT IF\nTHERE IS A CLINTON PRESIDENCY. >> THAT MAY BE SO, ALTHOUGH\nSTEVE BANNON SEEMS TO HAVE THE GREATEST ENMITY TOWARDS\nREPUBLICAN LEADERS, ESPECIALLY PAUL RYAN AND SEEMS TO BE\nZAGGING. SO WHATEVER STEP, I WOULDN'T\nNECESSARILY THINK IT WOULD BE A DOGMATIC ANCILLARY.\nI THINK HE HAS PROVED HE SEES THE MARKET NICHE DOING SOMETHING\nDIFFERENT, THAT'S OFTEN BEING AT ODDS WITH OTHER REPUBLICAN\nLEADERS AND THEIR PRIORITIES. >> RUSH LIMBAUGH LOSES A LOT OF\nELECTIONS. AS A CHEERLEADER, HE ENDS UP\nBEING THE CHEERLEADER FOR LOSERS.\nHE DOESN'T SEEM TO LOSE ANY INFLUENCE THROUGH THAT PROCESS.\nAND IF DONALD TRUMP IS MORE IN THE RUSH LIMBAUGH MOLD THAN IN\nTHE ROMNEY MOLD OR, YOU KNOW,",

THEY TOLD LIES.\n>> YOU ARE GOING THROUGH WITH THE LAWSUIT?\n>> LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE ELECTION.\n>> LESS THAN A WEEK AGO HE STOOD ON THE HALLOWED GROUND OF\nGETTYSBURG AND OUTLINED THE PLAN FOR HIS FIRST 100 DAYS AS\nPRESIDENT AND THAT INCLUDED LITIGATION.\n>> EVERY WOMAN LIED WHEN THEY CAME FORWARD TO HURT MY\nCAMPAIGN. TOTAL FABRICATION.\nTHE EVENTS NEVER HAPPENED. NEVER.\nALL OF THESE LIARS WILL BE SUED AFTER THE ELECTION IS OVER.\n>> SO THAT RAISES THE QUESTION, WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN NOW AND\nTHEN? WELL, THERE WAS A TWEET FROM A\nLEADING FIRST AMENDMENT LAWYER IN THE UNITED STATES WHO THE\n\"LOS ANGELES TIMES\" ONCE CALLED A HIRED GUN.\nHE POSTED I WILL REPRESENT PRO BONO ANYONE TRUMP SUES FOR\nEXERCISING THEIR FREE SPEECH RIGHTS.\nMANY OTHER LAWYERS HAVE OFFERED TO JOIN ME.\nHE IS JOINING US NOW. TED, THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH\nUS. DONALD TRUMP MAKES NO SECRET HE\nLIKES TO SUE PEOPLE. HE'S BEEN INVOLVED IN THOUSANDS\nOF LAWSUITS. ARE YOU SURPRISED HE MAY NOT\nFOLLOW THROUGH ON HIS THREATS THIS TIME?\n>> WELL, WHAT HE DOES IS HE THREATENS LAWSUITS AND HERE HE\nIS DOING IT TO CHILL FREE SPEECH AND CHILL CRITICS IN THE MIDDLE\nOF A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. I CAN'T IMAGINE A MORE BLATANT\nVIOLATION OF THE SPIRIT OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND THE\nCONSTITUTION. THE STATEMENT HE PLAYED HE SAID\nWE WILL SEE. HE IS KEEPING THE LAWSUIT P\nPOSSI POSSIBILITY.\nIF HE IS SAYING HE WINS OR LOSES HE WILL SUE, I'M NOT SURE.\nBUT HE IS USING THE THREAT TO DETER AND SQUELCH SPEECH.\nTHAT VIOLATES THE FIRST AMENDMENTS PRINCIPLES AND HE\nSHOULD STOP THREATENING PEOPLE AND STOP INTRUDING ON FIRST\nAMENDMENT RIGHTS. >> HIS WIFE, MELANIA, SHE SAYS\nSHE WANTS HER DAY IN COURT. THIS IS WHAT SHE SAID TO ABC\nNEWS. >> THEY WERE LIES, AND AS I SAID\nBEFORE, ALL THE ACCUSATIONS, THEY SHOULD BE HANDLED IN A\nCOURT OF LAW. >> Reporter: YOU BELIEVE THE\nLAWSUIT SHOULD GO FORWARD? >> YES, I BELIEVE THAT.\nBECAUSE TO ACCUSE SOMEBODY WITHOUT EVIDENCE IS VERY HURTFUL\nAND DAMAGING AND UNFAIR. BUT HONESTLY, DO WE STILL NEED\nTO TALK ABOUT THAT. >> WOULD TRUMP HAVE ANY CHANCE\nOF WINNING LAWSUIT BUT WHAT MIGHT BE A DOZEN SEPARATE\nLAWSUITS? >> I DON'T THINK HE HAS ANY\nCHANCE. HE'S A PUBLIC FIGURE, PROBABLY\nTHE MOST FAMOUS PERSON PERSON IN THE WORLD.\nTHE LIBEL STANDARD UNDER THE CASE CREATE A TREMENDOUS BURDEN.\nHE'D HAVE TO PROVE KNOWLEDGE OF FALSITY BY THE INDIVIDUALS.\nHE'D HAVE TO PROVE RECKLESS DISREGARD OF THE TRUTH.\nTHE STANDARDS ARE INSURMOUNTABLE FOR HIM.\nMRS. TRUMP SAID THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THERE'S EVIDENCE.\nTHE WOMEN HAVE COME FORWARD IN VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES AND\nTOLD THEIR STORIES AND THEIR -- WHAT THEY SAID HAPPENED.\nTHAT'S EVIDENCE. THAT'S DIRECT EVIDENCE.\nHE WOULD HAVE TO COUNTERTHAT WITH HIS OWN CLEAR AND\nCONVINCING EVIDENCE I DON'T THINK HE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO\nTHAT. HE WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH\nDEPOSITIONS. HE GAVE THAT SPEECH ABOUT HIS\nFIRST 100 DAYS. I IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT HE'S GOING\nTO HAVE 100 DAYS OF DEPOSITIONS. THAT'S HIS FIRST 100 DAYS IF HE\nBRINGS THE SUITS. >> YOU MADE THE OFFER ON THE\nBASIS OF DEFENDING FREE SPEECH. EXPLAIN HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT,\nTHESE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST DONALD TRUMP, WHY ARE THEY CONSIDERED\nFREE SPEECH ISSUE AND NOT SLANDER?\n>> WELL, HERE, WE HAVE, WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A POLITICAL\nCAMPAIGN. A CAMPAIGN'L FOR THE PRESIDENCY.\nTHAT'S WHERE THE FIRST AMENDMENT PROTECTIONS OF FREE SPEECH ARE\nAT THE HIGHEST, STRICTEST LEVEL. AT BOTTOM, THE FIRST AMENDMENT\nIS PROTECTING THE PEOPLE'S RIGHTS TO GATHER INFORMATION SO\nTHEY CAN GOVERN THEMSELVES. HERE WHERE WE HAVE A CAMPAIGN\nGOING, THESE ARE INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS SPEAKING OUT DURING AN\nELECTION. THEY HAVE EVERY FUNDAMENTAL\nRIGHT TO DO THAT. JUST TO CALL SOMETHING SLANDER\nTO DENY IT DOES NOT MEAN IT IS PROTECTED SPEECH.\nTHE CONSTITUTION CREATES WHAT THE SUPREME COURT HAS CALLED\nBREATHING SPACE AND TOLERATES CAUSTIC DEBATE, CRITICISM,\nPARTICULARLY OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, PARTICULARLY OF\nWEALTHY, POWERFUL INDIVIDUALS WHO WANT TO BE PRESIDENT.\nSO THIS IS THE ESSENCE OF WHAT THE FRAMERS OF OUR CONSTITUTION\nHAD IN MIND IN TERMS OF THE KIND OF DEBATE AND ARGUMENT ABOUT WHO\nSHOULD BE PRESIDENT. MR. TRUMP'S IN THE POSITION TO\nRESPOND. HE COULD LAY OUT HIS SIDE OF THE\nFACTS INSTEAD OF BRANDING PEOPLE LIARS.\nHELP HAS THE POWER AND ABILITY AND PLATFORM TO RESPOND WITH HIS\nOWN SPEECH. >> QUICKLY, HOW MANY OTHER\nLAWYERS HAVE SIGNED UP FOR THIS AND WHAT MESSAGE ARE YOU SENDING\nTO MR. TRUMP? >> IT HAS MADE ME FEEL GOOD\nABOUT MY PROFESSION. WE HAD LEAST 100 LAWYERS BY\nTWITTER, E-MAIL, FOERNGS INCLOOUDING LAURENCE TRIBE,\nSCHOLARS OF THE GREATEST MINDS WE HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY, AND IT\nSENDS A MESSAGE THERE'S GOING TO BE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD HERE.\nIF MR. TRUMP WANTS TO LITIGATE HE WILL HAVE AN ARMY OF LAWYERS\nWHO SAY YOU CAN'T ABUSE THE FIRST AMENDMENT THIS WAY IN AN\nELECTION. >> OKAY.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING IN. GOOD TO SPEAK TO YOU.\nTHANK YOU. >> INTERESTING CONVERSATION\nTHERE. >> IT IS INTERESTING HOW MANY\nPEOPLE, HOW MANY LAWYERS HAVE JUMPED ON.\nTHEY ARE SAYING IT IS NOT A POLITICAL ISSUE BUT A FREE\nSPEECH ISSUE. >> I HAD NO IDEA SO MANY\nANSWERED THE RALLYING .\n>> DOES ANYONE THINK THAT RUSSIA CAN IN SOME WAY INFLUENCE THE\nCHOICE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE? IS AMERICA SOME KIND OF A BANANA\nREPUBLIC? AMERICA IS A GREAT COUNTRY,\nCORRECT ME IF I AM WRONG.",

THE STORY COMES FROM BLOOMBERG\nMEDIA AND IT DETAILS HOW THEY'RE COLLECTING DETAIL ON THE\nMILLIONS OF SUPPORTERS, INFORMATION THAT TRUMP CAN\nLEVERAGE IN THE FUTURE WHETHER HE WINS THE WHITE HOUSE OR NOT.\nSTEVE BANNON SAYING WHAT HE'S BUILT IS THE UNDERLYING\nPOLITICAL APPARATUS THAT'S GOING TO PROPEL US TO VICTORY ON\nNOVEMBER 8 AND DOMINATE POLITICS AFTER THAT.\nTHE DIGITAL DIRECTOR ADDING TO THAT SAYING WE KNEW HOW VALUABLE\nTHIS WOULD BE AT THE OUTSET. WE OWN THE FUTURE OF THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY. JOINING US NOW, CHARLES\nKRAUTHAMMER. THIS IS BASICALLY A LOOK AT WHAT\nTHE FUTURE OF DONALD TRUMP AND HIS SUPPORTERS IS, WIN OR LOSE.\nLET'S START WITH WIN. IF HE MANAGES TO WIN ON NOVEMBER\n8th, THIS REPUBLICANISM NOW OFFICIALLY TRUMPISM AND WHAT\nDOES THAT MEAN FOR THE SO-CALLED MAINSTREAM REPUBLICANS LIKE YOU,\nYOU KNOW, LIKE RICH LOWRIE? >> WELL, I THINK IT'S QUITE -- I\nMEAN, IF YOU WIN THE PPRESIDENC, E CERTAINLY YOU RESHAPE OR YOU\nSHAPE YOUR PARTY. THE REPUBLICANS ARE NOT\nCOMPLETELY CONSERVATIVE UNCONFLICTED CONSERVATIVE PARTY.\nBEFORE RONALD REAGAN THEY HAD A STRONG NORTHEAST LIBERAL WING.\nREAGAN COMES IN, THE PARTY HAS BEEN CHANGED IRREVOCABLY.\nIF DONALD TRUMP WINS, HE'S NOT A CONSERVATIVE. HE'S A POPULIST.\nHE WILL HAVE A LITTLE MORE RESISTANCE THAT RONALD REAGAN\nDID. THERE WILL BE RESISTANCE FROM\nTHE OLD REAGAN CONSERVATIVES. BUT IF YOU'RE PRESIDENT,\nESPECIALLY IF YOU SUCCEED IN THE PRESIDENCY, MEANING YOU WIN\nREELECTION OR HAVE STRONG POPULAR SUPPORT LIKE REAGAN DID,\nWU SET DOWN THE RULES FOR A FEW DECADES.\n>>. WHAT IF THE OPPOSITE HAPPENS,\nTRUMP LOSES AND HE STILL HAS SO MUCH INFLUENCE.\nTHIS ARTICLE POINTS OUT HE'S SPENDING $100,000 A WEEK ON DATA\nCOLLECTION FIGURING OUT WHO'S WITH HIM HIM.\nAND THEY'VE DESCRIBED THE AUS AUDIENCE, DISENFRANCHISED\nREPUBLICANS WHO WITH YOUNG, RURAL AND ANGRY, ACTIVE AND\nFIERCELY LOYAL TO DONALD TRUMP. >> REMEMBER TRUMP SAID I COULD\nGO DOWN 5th AVENUE AND SHOOT SOMEBODY AND WOULDN'T LOSE ANY\nSUPPORTERS. THAT'S WHAT HAS HAPPENED,\nTHROUGH THICK AND THIN, THE ACCESS HOLLYWOOD TAPES WHICH\nWOULD HAVE SUNK ANYONE. >> WHAT DO THEY DO WITH THAT\nLOYALTY WHEN HE'S NO LONGER RUNNING FOR OFFICE?\n>> THAT WILL DEPEND ON HIM. HE HAS HIMSELF A PLURALITY OF\nREPUBLICANS. NOT A MAJORITY BUT HE'S GOT A\nSIZABLE CHUNK LARGER THAN ANYBODY ELSE'S.\nTHE QUESTION IS WHAT DOES HE WANT TO DO WITH IT, IS HE GOING\nTO BE GEORGE WAUK AND RIDE AWAY INTO THE SUNSET.\nIF YOU LOSE A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN THE MODERN HISTORY,\nYOU'RE GONE. THERE'S NO MON DALE OR DUKAKIS.\nYOU HAD YOUR CHANCE, YOU DON'T SHOW UP AGAIN.\nTHAT WOULD BE TRUMP. THEY FEEL THEY HAVE NOWHERE ELSE\nTO GO. IF HE DOES NOT WALK AWAY, THEN\nHE CAN DO A LOT WITH THE CONSTITUENCY, PARTICULARLY AS WE\nSAW IN THE BLOOMBERG ARTICLE IF HE HAS THE MECHANICS, THE DATA,\nA WAY TO E-MAIL AND REACH ALL OF THEM AND EVEN IF HE DOESN'T HE\nCAN USE TWITTER OR FACEBOOK. HE CAN SHAPE IT INTO A MOVEMENT\nEITHER TO RUN AGAIN FOR REELECTION TO INFLUENCE THE\nMIDTERM ELECTIONS, TO INFLUENCE THE CURRENT POLITICS.\nIF TRUMP DECIDES TO STAY IN THE GAME, THE FIRST TEST WILL BE\nWHETHER HE CAN SUCCESSFULLY BRING DOWN PAUL RYAN WHO HAS\nBECOME A NEMESIS OF HIS AND THEN WE'LL NOW HOW TRANSITIVE IS HIS\nINFLUENCE. >> RIGHT.\nIF YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED WITH JOHN McCAIN, HE WENT BACK\nTO THE U.S. SENATE. BUT MITT ROMNEY, FOR A WHILE HE\nWAS CONSIDERED A REPUBLICAN LEADER BUB BUT HIS INFLUENCE HAS\nDEFINITELY DIMINISHED. AND THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THE\nSAME THING WOULD HAPPEN TO TRUMP.\nAND YOU'RE SAYING IT'S UP TO TRUMP.\nHE SAYS IF I LOSE, THIS IS ALL FOR NOTHING, A COMPLETE WASTE OF\nTIME AND I'M GOING TO RUN MY SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS AND FOCUS ON\nPROFIT MAKING. IT'S UP TO TRUMP.\nWE'VE SPECULATED ABOUT TRUMP TV, WHETHER HE WANTS TO BUILD A\nMEDIA POWER. WE'RE UNSURE IF HE LOSES THIS\nTHING WHETHER THAT'S SOMETHING HE HAS ANY INTERESTED IN.\n>> BUT WE KNOW ONE THING FROM HIS ENTIRE LIFE HISTORY, HE\nLOVES THE SPOTLIGHT, HE FINDS IT HARD TO BE AWAY FROM IT.\nAND EVEN THOUGH HE SAID AT THE BEGINNING, IF I LOSE I'LL GO\nBACK TO MY OLD LIFE, I DON'T THINK -- HE WILL DECIDE.\nBUT IT IS LIKELY HE'LL BE CHANGED AND HE WILL HAVE\nACQUIRED A POWERFUL INSTRUMENT, A POLITICAL INSTRUMENT.\nHE DIDN'T HAVE THAT BEFORE HE RAN.\nAND HE CAN USE IT, HE COULD USE IT COMMERCIALLY, FOR EXAMPLE,\nWITH A TV STATION OR A TV NETWORK OR SOME OTHER USE IN THE\nMEDIA OR HE CAN DO IT POLITICALLY IN WHICH CASE HE\nMOBILIZES HIS PEOPLE TO INFLUENCE ELECTIONS AND PERHAPS\nHIS OWN LATER ON. IT'S EXTREMELY TEMPTING BECAUSE\nHE BUILT THIS ESSENTIALLY ON HIS OWN AND OUT OF NOWHERE AND HE'S\nGOT A LOT OF OPTIONS. HE'S NOT THE RETIRING TYPE, YOU\nMIGHT HAVE NOTICED. >> WELL EVEN IF TRUMP DOESN'T\nWIN ON NOVEMBER 8th, HE HAS ACTED AS A VOICE FOR A LARGE,\nYOU KNOW, LARGE NUMBER OS F PEOPLE WHO FEEL DISENFRANCHISED\nAND WE'LL SEE WHETHER TRUMP CONTINUES TO USE THAT POWER\nGIVING THEM A VOICE. HE WOULD MUCH RATHER DO IT FROM\nTHE OVAL OFFICE AND HE MAY YET DO THAT TOO.\n>> WE'LL SEE IF THE SO-CALLED ESTABLISHMENT IS ABLE TO\nRECOGNIZE THE POWER AND THE NEEDS OF THAT CONSTITUENCY AND\nTO KALT ITS POLICY TO ACCOMMODATE THEM.\nTHAT WOULD GO A LONG WAY AS WELL IN DETERMINING HOW THE\nCONSTITUENCY IS RESPONDED TO. >> GREAT TO SEE YOU.\nTHANK YOU.",

      "text": ">>> AND WELCOME TO \"HANNITY.\"\nTONIGHT THERE ARE JUST 12 DAYS LEFT TO STOP THE OBAMA/CLINTON\nMACHINE, AND WIKILEAKS DROPPED A MAJOR BOMBSHELL THAT COULD\nCHANGE THIS RACE. A NEWLY RELEASED E-MAIL DETAILS\nHOW BILL CLINTON USED HIS FAMILY FOUNDATION TO LINE HIS OWN\nPOCKETS WITH TENS AND TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.\nWITH ALL OF THE DETAILS TONIGHT IS FOX'S OWN ED HENRY.\nPRETTY BIG BLOCKBUSTER TONIGHT, ED.\n>> IT IS, SEAN. AND IT FOLLOWS THE STORY THAT\nHILLARY CLINTON HERSELF SOLICITED $12 MILLION DONATION\nFOR THE CLINTON FOUNDATION FROM THE KING OF MOROCCO AND HUMA\nABEDIN SUGGESTED IT WAS PAY-TO-PLAY BY BLUNTING\nDECLARING THE MONEY WAS GIVEN ON THE CONDITION CLINTON HAD TO BE\nTO MOROCCO AND GIVE A SPEECH. SHE BACKED OUT BUT BILL CLINTON\nAND CHELSEA WENT IN HER PLACE. AS YOU SAY, MORE DAMAGING\nE-MAILS FROM FORMER CLINTON INTIMATE, WHO LAYS OUT HOW BILL\nCLINTON LINED HIS OWN POCKETS BY STEERING DONORS FROM FROM THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION TO HIRE HIM FOR SPEECHES AND CONSULTING.\nLOOK AT THE 2011 MEMO REVEALING THE PLAN YIELDED MORE THAN\n$30 MILLION FOR HIM PERSONALLY WITH $66 MILLION TO BE PAID OUT\nIN YEARS AHEAD. ANOTHER INCREDIBLE REVELATION WE\nLEARNED TODAY, EVEN THE TOP TWO OFFICIALS IN HILLARY CLINTON'S\nPRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN WERE KEPT IN THE DARK ON THE FULL EXTENT\nOF HER E-MAIL SCANDAL BY EITHER THE CANDIDATE HERSELF OR OTHERS\nIN THE INNER SKIRK WILL. WHEN THE STORY FIRST BROKE,\nCAMPAIGN CHAIR PODESTA WROTE, DID YOU HAVE ANY IDEA OF THE\nDEPTH OF THIS STORY IN THE CAMPAIGN'S MANAGER RESPONDED,\nNOPE, WE BROUGHT UP THE EXISTENCE OF E-MAILS IN RESEARCH\nTHIS SUMMER BUT WERE TOLD EVERYTHING WAS TAKEN CARE OF.\nTHAT CAME AS THE \"NEW YORK TIMES\" POSTED ITS FIRST STORY\nMARCH 2nd, 2015, ALL ABOUT CLINTON'S USE OF PERSONAL E-MAIL\nACCOUNT AS SECRETARY OF STATE. A DRAMATIC SIGN THE POTENTIAL\nNEXT COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF SHARES CRITICAL INFORMATION WITH ONLY A\nFEW TRUSTED ADVISERS. ALL OF THE SECRETNESS WAS TOO\nMUCH. SHE WROTE TO JOHN PODESTA ABOUT\nTHE E-MAIL SCANDAL IN THE SUMMER OF 2015, IT IS LIKE THE WHOLE\nTHING IS BLEEPING INSANE. THAT HONEST ADMISSION COMES AT\nTHE SAME TIME, REMEMBER, CLINTON HERSELF AND HER AIDES IN THE\nSUMMER OF 2015 KEPT TELLING US THIS IS NOT A BIG DEAL, THERE'S\nNOTHING TO SEE HERE, MOVE ON. EVEN ONE OF HER TOP ADVISERS WAS\nSAYING IT WAS INSANE, SEAN. >> WE HAVE TO REMEMBER YOUR\nQUESTION. YOU SAID, DID YOU HAVE YOUR\nSERVER WIPED CLEAN AND SHE GOES, YOU MEAN LIKE WITH A CLOTH.\nWE KNOW IT WAS BLEACH BIT AND ACID WATCH.\nI WANT TO SAY THE ONE INDIVIDUAL YOU QUOTED AS SAYING IT WAS\nBLEEPING INSANE, ALSO I WAS TOLD EVERYTHING WAS TAKEN CARE OF.\nTAKEN CARE OF FITS INTO THE BLEACH BIT NARRATIVE, THAT THEY\nWIPED IT OUT AND GOT RID OF THE PROBLEM.\nISN'T THAT ALMOST AN ADMISSION OF GUILT?\nCORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, WERE THOSE E-MAILS SUBPOENAED BY THAT\nPOINT? >> WELL, THEY WERE SUBPOENAED\nRIGHT AFTER THAT POINT, WE SHOULD SAY.\nSO THE CAMPAIGN MANAGER HAVING THE CONVERSATION AS THE \"NEW\nYORK TIMES\" BROKE THE STORY MARCH 2nd, TREY GOWDY I BELIEVE\nISSUED THE SUBPOENA MARCH 4th, 2015.\nSO IT IS HAPPENING IN THE SAME TIME PERIOD, BUT MAYBE HE IS\nREFERRING TO THAT HE WENT TO HILLARY CLINTON AND SAID WHAT IS\nGOING ON WITH THE E-MAIL AND SHE SAID IT IS FINE, OR MAYBE HUMA\nAB DEEM SAID THAT. BUT DID THEY SUGGEST THERE'S\nNOTHING TO SEE HERE, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, AND HE MOVED ON TO\nOTHER ISSUES? IT SHOWS HILLARY CLINTON WASN'T\nJUST DODGING THE PRESS BUT MAYBE HER OWN CAMPAIGN MANAGER.\nWHEN SOMEONE DOES THAT, IT SUGGESTS THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO\nHIDE. >> YOU KNOW, THERE'S ALSO\nINTERNAL IN-FIGHTING HERE. CLONG-TIME CLINTON AIDE, DOUG\nBAND, HE IS RESPONDING TO CHELSEA CLINTON'S SUGGESTION\nTHAT THEY WERE MAKING MONEY OFF THEIR PROXIMITY TO BILL CLINTON.\nHE WRITES A PRETTY FIERCE E-MAIL BACK, AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT\n$116 MILLION THAT HE'S LINED UP ON THE BOOKS FOR THE CLINTONS.\nTHAT'S A LOT OF MONEY. >> YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE THE\nDETAILS. CHELSEA CLINTON I THINK WAS THE\nGOOD ACTOR IN ALL OF THIS. >> I ACTUALLY AGREE WITH ALL OF\nTHAT. >> SHE WAS BLOWING THE WHISTLE\nAND SAYING, LOOK, THERE'S PROBLEMS WITH FOUNDATION.\nWHAT IS SIGNIFICANT IS THEY KEEP SAYING AT THE FOUNDATION, IT IS\nCONSERVATIVE CRITICS BEATING UP ON THE FOUNDATION.\nCHELSEA CLINTON WAS SAYING THERE'S PROBLEM, THAT'S\nSIGNIFICANT. NUMBER TWO, SHE BROUGHT IN AN\nINDEPENDENT FIRM TO DO AN AUDIT. THAT'S WHAT THE LAW FIRM FOUND.\nIT IS NOT CONSERVATIVE CRITICS. THE DETAILS OF THIS, DOUG BAND,\nCHELSEA CLINTON WENT AFTER HIM AND SAID, LOOK, I'M HEARING\nSPECULATION DOUG BAND IS TRADING ON MY FATHER'S NAME, BILL CLINTON'S NAME FOR HIS\nCONSULTING COMPANY. HE DENIES THAT AND SAYS HE\nDIDN'T MAKE MONEY OFF BILL CLINTON.\nWE'LL LEAVE IT ASIDE FOR A SECOND.\nHE FIRED BACK WITH THE MONEY YOU MENTIONED AND WE HAVE ANOTHER\nE-MAIL WHERE HE SAID BILL CLINTON IS BEING PAID BY THREE\nDIFFERENT SPONSORS OF THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, SO HE'S THE\nONE WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. AND HE SAID BILL CLINTON HAS\nTAKEN BIG, PERSONAL GIFTS THAT ARE NOW IN THE CLINTON HOME,\nEITHER IN CHAP KWAU OR WASHINGTON.\nIN THE HOME OF HILLARY CLINTON, POTENTIAL NEXT PRESIDENT.\n>> AND HE'S MAD HE DIDN'T GET A CUT OF THAT, HE COMPLAINED BACK.\nED HENRY, THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.\nRNC CHAIRMAN RICE PRIEBUS REACTING TO NEW REVELATIONS\nABOUT HOW BILL CLINTON IS MAKING ALL OF THIS MONEY BY SAYING,\nQUOTE, THIS MEMO IS THE SMOKING GUN FOR HOW THE CLINTONS USE\nTHEIR FOUNDATION TO CREATE A MASSIVE FOR-PROFIT, PAID\nSPEAKING CONSULTING BUSINESS ALL TO ENRICH THEMSELVES.\nHERE WITH REACTION THE AUTHOR OF BEST SELLER \"TREASON\" FORMER\nSPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR NEWT GINGRICH WITH\nUS. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT\n$116 MILLION. I WANT TO PUT THESE REVELATIONS\nNEXT TO AN AP STORY THAT SAID, REMEMBER, 55% OF INDIVIDUALS\nTHAT GOT TO SEE HILLARY WHEN SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE WERE\nEITHER DONORS OR PEOPLE COMMITTING MONEY TO THE\nFOUNDATION. NOW, ADD THAT TO THE HAITI\nSTORY. THEY RAISE THIS MONEY.\nSEPARATE LIST FOR FOUNDATION DONORS AND FRIENDS OF BILL, SO\nTHEY CAN CASH IN ON THE CONTRACTS AFTER 150,000 PEOPLE\nDIED AND THEY RAISED MONEY, AND THEY WOULD BE FIRST IN LINE TO\nMAKE MORE MONEY SO THEY CAN FUNNEL IT BACK TO THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION. HOW DOES IT NOT GET PICKED UP?\nHOW IS THIS NOT WATERGATE IN THE MINDS OF THE REST OF THE MEDIA?\n>> WELL, IT IS BEGINNING TO GET PICKED UP.\nI THINK SOMEBODY POINTED OUT ON MORNING JOE THEY SPENT 13\nMINUTES ATTACKING THE CLINTONS THIS MORNING.\nNOW, THAT'S UNHEARD OF. THAT'S A BREAK DOWN IN ELITE\nMEDIA DISCIPLINE THAT IS HARD TO IMAGINE.\nIT WILL BE INTERESTING THE SEE BY TOMORROW, WHERE IS \"THE\nWASHINGTON POST,\" WHERE IS THE \"NEW YORK TIMES\"?\nTHIS STUFF IS GETTING SO BIG AND SMELLING SO BAD I THINK THEY'RE\nGOING TO HAVE A HARD TIME HIDING FROM IT.\nYOU KNOW, IF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION WAS STILL A LAW\nENFORCEMENT AGENCY, WE WOULD HAVE A GRAND JURY IMPANELLED TO\nBE TAKING TESTIMONY RIGHT NOW AND NOT NEGOTIATING BUT ISSUING\nSUBPOENAS. >> WAIT A MINUTE, I BEG TO\nDIFFER. OH, NO, THEY'RE A LAW\nENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATION. BECAUSE IF YOU DID IT, THEY\nWOULD HAVE IMPANELLED THAT GRAND JURY BY NOW.\nIF I DID IT, THAT GRAND JURY WILL BE IMPANELLED RIGHT NOW.\nTHEREIN LIES A BIG PROBLEM WE HAVE WITH OUR JUSTICE\nDEPARTMENT. >> RIGHT.\nBECAUSE THAT'S NOT LAW ENFORCEMENT, THAT'S SELECTING\nPROSECUTION. LAW ENFORCEMENT SAYS THAT ALL OF\nUS ARE UNDER THE LAW, ALL OF US HAVE TO OBEY THE LAW, ALL OF US\nHAVE TO FACE THE SAME CONSEQUENCES.\nWE KNOW FOR A FACT FROM ALL OF THIS STUFF THAT, YEAH, YOU HAVE\nTHE HEAD OF THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN, JOHN PODESTA, GOING\nOFF TO DINNER WITH THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.\nYOU HAVE WEIRD NEGOTIATIONS WITH VARIOUS CLINTON OFFICIALS,\nTHINGS NOBODY GETS FROM THE FBI. YOU HAVE THE PRESIDENT, THE\nFORMER PRESIDENT AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL MEETING ON A\nPLANE IN SECRET THE SAME WEEK THEY'RE GOING TO INTERROGATE\nHILLARY. I MEAN THIS IS THE KIND OF STUFF\nTHAT IN A PLACE LIKE VENEZUELA YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND BECAUSE\nTHEY DON'T HAVE THE RULE OF LAW. BUT WHAT WE ARE SEEING RIGHT\nNOW, AND WIKILEAKS IN A SENSE IS RIPPING THE SCAR OFF OF THE\nLARGEST AMOUNT OF CORRUPTION IN AMERICAN HISTORY.\nTHIS BEATS ANY PRIOR CORRUPTION SCANDAL I KNOW OF, INCLUDING THE\n1868 WHERE GRANT WAS PRESIDENT, INCLUDING THE HARDING\nADMINISTRATION. I MEAN INCLUDING SOME OF THE\nTHINGS THAT HAPPENED UNDER TRUMAN.\nNONE OF THOSE THINGS ARE LIKE THIS.\nTHIS IS THE LARGEST SCANDAL AFFECTING A SENIOR AMERICAN\nPOLITICIAN I THINK IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAND IT IS AS YOU YOURSELF JUST POINTED OUT, YOU HAVE HILLARY\nCLINTON CLEARLY TRADING ON THE OFFICE OF SECRETARY OF STATE IN\nA WAY WHICH HAS TO BE -- I'M NOT A LAWYER, BUT MY GUESS IS YOU'VE\nGOT PROBABLY 60 OR 70 COUNTS AGAINST HER JUST IN TERMS OF\nSCHEDULING PEOPLE TO COME INTO HER OFFICE.\n>> AND YET SHE CAN BE ELECTED PRESIDENT.\nACCORDING TO POLLS SHE IS IN THIS RACE, IN 12 DAYS SHE COULD\nPOSSIBLY WIN THIS ELECTION. >> RIGHT.\n>> WHAT DOES THAT SAY? >> THAT'S RIGHT.\nWELL, IT SAYS THAT OUR COUNTRY IS A CULTURE IN CRISIS.\nOUR COUNTRY HAS GOT TO DECIDE DOES THE RULE OF LAW APPLY TO\nEVERYONE OR ARE WE NOW GOING TO BE A COUNTRY WHERE SOME PEOPLE\nARE ABOVE THE LAW, AND NO MATTER HOW CORRUPT THEY ARE, YOU\nKNOW -- PUTTING BILL CLINTON BACK IN THE WHITE HOUSE, GIVING\nEVERYTHING WE'RE LEARNING I THINK WOULD BE ALMOST A SIGN OF\nSICKNESS. I -- PERSONALLY, THIS IS WHY I\nALWAYS TOLD YOU I THOUGHT SHE WOULD LOSE AND DONALD TRUMP\nWOULD WIN. IN THE END I DON'T THINK THE\nMAJORITY OF AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GOING TO PUT SOMEBODY WHO IS A\nLIAR AND A CROOK IN THE WHITE HOUSE.\nI JUST -- I HAVE ENOUGH FAITH IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT WHEN\nTHEY GET DOWN TO VOTING -- I HAD SEVERAL PEOPLE SAY THIS TO ME\nTHIS WEEK, THAT WHEN THEY GOT RIGHT DOWN TO IT THEY SIMPLY\nCOULDN'T VOTE FOR HER. >> ALL RIGHT.\nWE WILL TAKE A BREAK. WE WILL COME BACK.\nMORE WITH NEWT GINGRICH RIGHT AFTER THIS BREAK, AND ALSO\nCOMING UP TONIGHT.",

THAT'S BEEN GREAT BECAUSE WHAT\nWE NEED AS A PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE IS THE FIELD OPERATION,\nTHE DATA, CERTAINLY THE GROUND GAME.\nAND THE RNC CAME BEARING GIFTS FOR ITS NOMINEE THIS YEAR.\nIT HAPPENS THAT IT'S DONALD TRUMP.\n>> TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER KELLYANNE CONWAY TALKING ABOUT\nTHE GREAT RELATIONSHIP THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS WITH THE RNC.\nTHE RNC CAME BEARING GIFTS FOR THE CAMPAIGN THIS YEAR.\nPARTIES AND THEIR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE\nGOOD RELATIONSHIPS. THAT'S PART OF THE DEAL.\nTHAT'S USUALLY AT LEAST IDEALLY HOW IT WORKS.\nBUT THAT RELATIONSHIP, THAT COORDINATION AND THE EXTENT OF\nTHAT COORDINATION IS SOMETHING THAT IS NOW MATERIALLY IMPORTANT\nTO THE BREAKING NEWS THAT WE REPORTED HERE LAST NIGHT AFTER\nTHE DEMOCRATIC PARTY LAST NIGHT FILED PAPERS IN FEDERAL COURT IN\nNEW JERSEY ASKING THAT COURT TO HOLD THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN\nVIOLATION OF AN ANCIENT CONSENT DECREE THAT DATES BACK TO THE\n1980s. IT DATES BACK TO AN ELECTION IN\nWHICH THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN PARTY SENT BASICALLY VIGILANTE\nPOLL WATCHERS INTO MINORITY PRECINCTS IN 1981.\nMANY OF THEM WORE GUNS, THEY WORE THESE BALLOT SECURITY TASK\nFORCE ARM BANDS AND THEY PATROLLED VOTING SITES IN DOZENS\nOF PRECINCTS THAT HAD MOSTLY MINORITY VOTERS.\nAND THE REPUBLICANS DID VERY, VERY, VERY NARROWLY WIN THAT\nGOVERNOR'S RACE IN NEW JERSEY THAT YEAR.\nBUT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY SUED OVER THIS BALLOT SECURITY TASK\nFORCE THING. AND THE DEMOCRATS WON THAT CASE.\nAND THE REPUBLICANS SIGNED ON TO A CONSENT DECREE BECAUSE OF IT.\nAND NOW, 35 YEARS LATER, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS STILL TRYING\nTO GET OUT FROM UNDER THE LEGAL RESTRICTIONS THAT WERE PUT ON\nTHEM BECAUSE OF THAT CASE. AND IN THE MIDST OF THAT, HERE'S\nWHAT DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN SAYING OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN\nTRAIL. >> WE HAVE A LOT OF LAW\nENFORCEMENT PEOPLE WORKING THAT DAY.\nWE'RE HIRING A LOT OF PEOPLE. WE'RE PUTTING A LOT OF LAW\nENFORCEMENT. WE HAVE SOME GREAT PEOPLE HERE,\nSOME GREAT LEADERS HERE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, AND THEY'RE\nVERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. AND THAT'S THE WAY WE COULD LOSE\nTHE STATE. >> SO IMPORTANT THAT YOU WATCH\nOTHER COMMUNITIES, BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THIS ELECTION STOLEN\nFROM US. >> WHEN I SAY WATCH, YOU KNOW\nWHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, RIGHT? YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.\n>> YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.\nWE'RE GOING TO HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT DOING THIS.\nWE DON'T WANT THIS ELECTION STOLEN FROM US.\nWE HAVE SOME GREAT LEADERS OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\nDONALD TRUMP IS NOT UNDER A CONSENT DECREE THAT DATES BACK\nTO THE 1980s ON THIS SUBJECT. THE RNC IS UNDER A CONSENT\nDECREE THAT DATES BACK TO THE 1980s ON THIS SUBJECT.\nI MEAN TECHNICALLY DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF CAN GO OUT AND TALK\nABOUT ALL OF THIS STUFF, BUT THE RNC UNDER THIS CONSENT DECREE,\nTHEY CAN'T TAKE PART IN ANY OF IT.\nIT HAS TO BE CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT THERE'S NO WORKING TOGETHER HERE\nBETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND THE RNC ON ISSUES OF BALLOT\nINTEGRITY AND POLL WATCHING ON ELECTION DAY, PARTICULARLY WHEN\nTHOSE EFFORTS TARGET MINORITY DISTRICTS.\nIF THERE IS COORDINATION, THAT MAY BE A PROBLEM.\nTHE DEMOCRATIC PARTY NOW ARGUES THAT WOULD BE A VIOLATION OF\nTHAT CONSENT DECREE. >> I FINALLY PULLED ASIDE\nKELLYANNE CONWAY AND SAID WHAT IS THE CAMPAIGN GOING TO DO.\nIS THIS THE CENTRAL STRATEGY TO CONTEST THE ELECTION.\nSHE SAID SHE'S ACTIVELY WORKING WITH THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL\nCOMMITTEE, THE OFFICIAL PARTY AND CAMPAIGN LAWYERS TO MONITOR\nPRECINCTS AROUND THE COUNTRY. SO THIS ISN'T JUST AN OUTSIDE\nCAMPAIGN AND OUTSIDE CANDIDATE. HE'S TYING HIMSELF TO THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY WITH HIM. >> IT'S A TREMENDOUS QUESTION\nAND I WILL TELL YOU THAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND THE\nREPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE ARE WORKING VERY, VERY CLOSELY\nWITH STATE GOVERNMENTS AND SECRETARY OF STATE OF STATES ALL\nOVER THE COUNTRY TO ENSURE BALLOT INTEGRITY.\n>> WORKING VERY, VERY, VERY, CLOSELY.\nI SHOULD SAY YOU JUST SAW ROBERT COSTA REPORTING WHAT HE HAD\nHEARD FROM KELLYANNE CONWAY SAYING THAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN\nIS ACTIVELY WORKING WITH THE RNC TO MONITOR PRECINCTS AROUND THE\nCOUNTRY. AFTER KELLYANNE CONWAY TOLD\nROBERT COSTA THAT AND HE REPORTED IT HERE ON MSNBC,\nKELLYANNE CONWAY WALKED THAT STATEMENT BACK AND THE RNC IS\nAGGRESSIVELY DENYING THIS COORDINATION.\nBUT HOW ABOUT MIKE PENCE SAYING, RIGHT, THAT THIS BALLOT\nINTEGRITY IS A TREMENDOUS QUESTION THIS YEAR AND THE RNC,\nTHE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE, IS WORKING VERY, VERY\nCLOSELY WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN TO ENSURE BALLOT INTEGRITY.\nHOW ABOUT THAT? HE DIDN'T WALK THAT BACK.\nPART OF THE DNC FILING FROM LAST NIGHT ALLEGES THAT THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY AND THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN ARE SHARING STAFF,\nTHEY'RE SHARING RESOURCES, THEY'RE COORDINATING THESE\nTHINGS. THERE'S SO MUCH COORDINATION\nTHAT THERE ARE NO LINES DELINEATING WHERE ONE STARTS AND\nANOTHER ENDS. THE RNC, ACCORDING TO THIS\nCOMPLAINT, QUOTE, COMMINGLED ITS STAFF AND RESOURCES WITH THE\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN AND SO IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEPARATE THE TWO.\nTHAT'S WHAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS ALLEGING.\nARGUABLY, THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE ASKING THE COURT TO DETERMINE.\nTHAT'S THE CRUX OF THIS WHOLE THING.\nWHEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN PROMISES IT'S GOING TO DO THIS IN THESE\nCITIES, AS TRUMP SAYS, INNER CITIES IN SWING STATES, IS HE\nTALKING ABOUT DOING THAT ALONE OR IS THE RNC INVOLVED?\nLET ME LEAVE YOU WITH ONE MORE THING THAT SEEMS RELEVANT HERE.\nTHIS IS THE HEAD OF THE RNC, REINCE PRIEBUS, SPEAKING ON\nSUNDAY. >> I DON'T MEAN HIS RESPONSE TO\nTHE DEBATE, JUST IN GENERAL WHEN HE GOES OUT AND SAYS THE\nELECTION IS RIGGED, HE SAID IT LAST NIGHT.\n>> I THINK HE'S TRYING TO ALSO TELL HIS FOLKS TO WATCH OUT FOR\nTHIS FRAUD THAT MIGHT OCCUR. >> HE'S TRYING TO TELL HIS FOLKS\nTO WATCH OUT FOR THIS FRAUD THAT MIGHT OCCUR, SAYS THE HEAD OF\nTHE RNC. ON ONE HAND REINCE PRIEBUS IS\nDECODING DONALD TRUMP THERE ON CBS THIS WEEKEND.\nON THE OTHER HAND, I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE RNC AND THIS\nTHREAT TO RIG THE ELECTION AND THIS FRAUD THAT MIGHT OCCUR AND\nWHETHER THE RNC IS WORKING ON THIS.\nTELL ME MORE, MR. HEAD OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\nOH, YOU'RE NOT HERE. LET'S INSTEAD ASK BEN GINSBURG,\nFORMER GENERAL COUNSEL AND AN MSNBC ANALYST.\nI AM NOT ASKING YOU TO BE REINCE PRIEBUS OR TO DEFEND REINCE\nPRIEBUS. >> I APPRECIATE THAT.\n>> BUT I DO WANT YOU TO GIVE ME YOUR VIEW ON WHAT'S GOING ON\nRIGHT NOW WITH THIS COMPLAINT. YOU'RE THE MAN WHO SAID THAT YOU\nCOULD BASICALLY GUARANTEE THAT THE DEMOCRATS WERE GOING TO MAKE\nTHIS COURT FILING ONCE YOU SAW WHAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WAS\nTALKING ABOUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\n>> YEAH, AND WHAT I ADDED TO THAT AND WHAT I SORT OF SAID\nDIRECTLY LATER IN THE EVENING WAS THAT IN FACT THAT ACTIVITY\nWAS NOT TAKING PLACE BECAUSE -- WELL, I DON'T WANT THE RNC, BUT\nI DO KNOW THAT THE RNC TAKES THE CONSENT DECREE VERY SERIOUSLY.\nWHAT YOU HAVE IS SOME BAD RHETORIC, BUT NOT THE ACTIONS.\nSO THE WHOLE CONSENT DECREE ITSELF AND THE SORT OF MUSCLING\nUP IN POLLING PLACES HAS BEEN A BLACK MARK ON THE REPUBLICAN\nPARTY. THAT HAS HARMED IT NOT ONLY\nREPUTATIONALLY, WHICH IS WHY THE DEMOCRATS OR PURSUING THIS\nCONSENT DECREE, BUT ALSO REALLY POLITICALLY.\nAND SO ALL IN ALL, THIS IS A MOMENT THAT THE REPUBLICAN\nNATIONAL COMMITTEE WANTS TO GET BEYOND SO THAT IT CAN ENGAGE\nWITH ITS STATE PARTIES IN THE PERMISSIBLE LOOKING AT THE\nELECTIONS. AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF BEING\nSURE THAT THE VOTERS UNDERSTAND THAT THE ELECTION IS FAIR AND IS\nNOT RIGGED AND THE PRACTICES IN THE POLLING PLACES ARE BEING\nCONDUCTED CORRECTLY. >> THAT'S PART OF THIS THAT I'VE\nBEEN TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON. I'M GLAD TO HEAR YOU EXPLAIN IT\nTHAT WAY, BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND WHAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY\nGOT NAILED FOR IN THE '80s WAS COMIC BOOK EGREGIOUS, BUT I\nHAVEN'T REALLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT -- I'M ASSUMING THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY DOESN'T WANT TO DO THE ARM BANDS AND OFF-DUTY\nGUNS, I'M ASSUMING, ALTHOUGH WE COULD -- NO, WE WON'T MAKE THAT\nARGUMENT. LET'S ASSUME THAT THE REPUBLICAN\nPARTY DOESN'T. WHAT DOES THE REPUBLICAN PARTY\nWANT TO DO THAT'S NOT RACIST, THAT'S NOT EGREGIOUS, THAT'S NOT\nSUPPRESSIVE, THAT THEY'RE PROHIBITED FROM DOING BY THIS\nCONSENT DECREE? WHY DO THEY FEEL SO CONSTRAINED?\n>> EVERY STATE, EVERY STATE ALLOWS REPRESENTATIVES OF THE\nPOLITICAL PARTIES OR CAMPAIGNS OR A COMBINATION OF THE TWO TO\nOBSERVE WHAT GOES ON IN THE POLLING PLACE.\nTHAT IS A MATTER OF BEING ABLE TO ENSURE THE FAIRNESS OF\nELECTIONS. AS A NATIONAL PARTY COMMITTEE,\nIT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE TO\nPARTICIPATE IN THOSE PERMISSIBLE, LAWFUL ACTIVITIES\nJUST AS THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE DOES NOW.\n>> AND THE DNC CAN DO THAT NOW AND THE RNC BECAUSE OF THAT\nCONSENT DECREE, THEY CAN'T. >> CORRECT.\n>> SO WHEN YOU SAY THAT THE RNC IS NOT DOING ANYTHING THAT MIGHT\nVIOLATE THAT CONSENT DECREE, THEY'RE NOT DOING ANY OF THIS\nPOLL WATCHING STUFF, THEY'RE NOT WORKING ON IT, THEY CAN'T BE --\n>> THEY CAN GIVE ADVICE TO THE >> SO WHAT ABOUT MIKE PENCE\nSAYING WE'RE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE RNC ON BALLOT\nINTEGRITY ISSUES AND MAKING SURE THIS ISN'T STOLEN.\n>> I CAN'T SPEAK FOR HIM. I DO KNOW HE MADE THAT STATEMENT\nIN AUGUST AND WE'RE NOW IN OCTOBER AND NONE OF THOSE\nACTIVITIES OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE PERSONNEL\nWORKING IN THE POLLING PLACE, ACTIVITIES HAS TAKEN PLACE AS\nFAR AS I KNOW OR AS FAR AS THE DEMOCRATS COULD SAY.\n>> WHAT ABOUT THE RNC STAFF WORKING BASICALLY IN-HOUSE AT\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN NOW. YOU KNOW, RNC LIKE SEAN SPICER\nHAS BEEN WORKING BASICALLY IN-HOUSE WITH THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN. IF ONE OF THE THINGS THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN IS DOING IS GETTING PEOPLE TO SIGN UP TO GO BE POLL\nWATCHERS, DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE RNC WITH HAVING THEIR STAFF\nINSIDE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, THAT THEY'RE IN EFFECT PARTICIPATING\nIN IT? >> NO, BECAUSE I THINK THE WAY\nTHEY'RE WORKING IT IS THAT YOU'VE GOT A SORT OF A UNIT, THE\nFIELD PEOPLE, TRYING TO GET PEOPLE IN PLACE TO BE ABLE TO\nOBSERVE AS THEY'RE ALLOWED TO UNDER STATE LAWS.\nI THINK THE RNC PERSONNEL HAVE AT LEAST BEEN GIVEN INSTRUCTIONS\nTO NOT PARTICIPATE IN THOSE ACTIVITIES.\nACTIVITIES. LOOK AT THE HE ELECTIONS.\nSTORIES BEHIND IT AND THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT'S BEHIND IT\nGIVES THIS SO MUCH HEAT AND ENERGY, WE HAVE ALREADY HEARD\nTHAT THEY'VE ASKED, THE JUDGE HAS ASKED FOR THIS TO MOVE\nREALLY FAST. THEY'VE ASKED FOR THE PARTIES TO\nBE IN COURT ON WEDNESDAY MORNING.\n>> THERE'S A LONG TRADITION OF BEING IN THE FEDERAL DISTRICT\nCOURT NOWHERE CLOSE TO THE ELECTIONS.\nTHANK YOU.",

THAT'S RIGHT.\nHILLARY DOESN'T PLAY. >> HILLARY DOESN'T PLAY.\nTHAT WAS HILLARY CLINTON AND MICHELLE OBAMA TODAY IN\nWINSTON-SALEM, NORTH CAROLINA. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THEY HAVE\nDONE A JOINT CAMPAIGN APPEARANCE.\nAND, AS THAT WAS KIND OF, WE PLAYED THAT BIT THERE TO GIVE\nYOU A SENSE OF THE VIBE THERE. I THINK BASICALLY TAKING TURNS\nHEAPING PRAISE ON ONE ANOTHER, AND THIS EVENT WAS ONE OF\nHILLARY CLINTON'S BIGGEST EVENTS OF THE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN.\nTHERE WERE APPARENTLY 14,000 PEOPLE THERE AT THIS NORTH\nCAROLINA RALLY TODAY. AND THIS WAS A GOOD ONE TO\nCHOOSE TO BE A BIG ONE, BECAUSE MICHELLE OBAMA WAS THERE.\nONE OF THE MOST BELOVED FIGURES IN POLITICS RIGHT NOW.\nONE OF THE MOST POPULAR FIGURES IN POLITICS, CERTAINLY AMONG\nDEMOCRATS, PARTICULARLY AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICAN DEMOCRATS, AND\nA ABSOLUTELY KEY CONSTITUENCY. THIS MAY HAVE BEEN ONE OF\nHILLARY CLINTON'S MOST IMPORTANT APPEARANCES TODAY.\nAND IT WAS WARM. AND HILLARY CLINTON WAS AT HER\nBEST, AND IT WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE THINGS SHE\nHAS DONE. BUT.\nWHAT MIGHT BE MOST IMPORTANT HERE IS WE GOT AN ANSWER TO A\nQUESTION THAT HAS BEEN FLOATING AROUND THE OBAMA FAMILY'S\nPENDING DEPARTURE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.\nNOW THIS HAS NOT BEEN COVERED WIDELY TODAY.\nMAYBE EVERYBODY ELSE DOESN'T SEE THIS AS THE BIGGEST DEAL OF THE\nWORLD. I REALIZE THAT THE FATE OF THE\nFREE WORLD DOES NOT RELY ON THIS QUESTION.\nBUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S A STRESSFUL TIME.\nIN THIS MOST STRESSFUL OF ELECTIONS, WE HERE AT THE SHOW\nAND WE IN MY FAMILY HAVE BEEN CHEWING ON OUR FINGERNAILS A\nLITTLE BIT, WONDERING WITH A LITTLE BIT OF ACTUAL STRESS\nWHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE WHITE HOUSE VEGETABLE GARDEN.\nWHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO IT? THE KITCHEN GARDEN PLANTED BY\nFIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA. THIS HAS BEEN A PASSION OF HER\nTIME IN THE WHITE HOUSE, FOR ALMOST THE ENTIRE TIME SHE'S\nBEEN THERE, SHE'S BEEN BUILDING IT UP, MAINTAINING IT AND\nSHOWING IT OFF. RECENTLY, EXPANDING IT.\nAND DIFFERENT PRESIDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES DO DIFFERENT\nTHINGS TO THE WHITE HOUSE, THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES THAT THE NEXT\nOCCUPANTS WILL KEEP ANYTHING THAT THE LAST OCCUPANTS OF THE\nWHITE HOUSE DID TO THE GROUNDS. THE NEW PRESIDENT WOULD BE\nABSOLUTELY FREE TO PLOW THE VEGETABLE GARDEN UNDER, IF THEY\nLIKE, RIGHT? JIMMY CARTER, YOU WANT TO PUT\nSOLAR PANELS ON THE WHITE HOUSE, RONALD REAGAN WANTS TO TAKE THEM\nDOWN. REALLY EXPECT MELANIA TRUMP OR\nBILL CLINTON TO BE OUT THERE TENDING TO THE TURNIPS AND\nHARVESTING THE OKRA? REALLY?\nARE THEY GOING TO KEEP IT? AS HER TIME GROWS SHORT,\nMICHELLE OBAMA HAS HARDENED THE GARDEN'S DEFENSES.\nSHE UNVEILED AN EXPANDED GARDEN NOW TWICE ITS ORIGINAL SIZE AND\nIT'S GOT HARD PARTS. STONE WALKWAYS AND PLANTERS MADE\nFROM CONCRETE AND STEEL AND PICNIC TABLES AND STUFF.\nFIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA ANNOUNCED A MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR\nGRANT FOR MAINTAINING IT. SO IT WON'T BE AN EXCUSE IF THEY\nWANTED TO GET RID OF THE GARDEN FOR THAT REASON.\nNOT INCIDENTALLY, MICHELLE OBAMA PLANTED A COUPLE OF CROPS THAT\nARE IN THE GROUND NOW THAT WON'T BE READY FOR HARVEST UNTIL THE\nSPRING, WHEN THERE'S A NEW PRESIDENT.\nWHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? WASTE THAT FOOD?\nSO IT'S BEEN A DISCUSSION. WILL THE NEXT PRESIDENT KEEP THE\nGARDEN OR PUT UP A PARKING LOT? TODAY WE GOT AN ANSWER.\nAT LEAST IF HILLARY CLINTON WINS.\n>> NOW SHE ALSO PLANTED AN AMAZING VEGETABLE GARDEN AT THE\nWHITE HOUSE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]\nAND I CAN PROMISE YOU, IF I WIN, I WILL TAKE GOOD CARE OF IT,\nMICHELLE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]\n>> IF HILLARY CLINTON WINS THE ELECTION, THE GARDEN LIVES!\nLOOK HOW HAPPY THAT MAKES MICHELLE OBAMA.\nI DON'T REALLY TOTALLY UNDERSTAND WHY I'M SO ATTACHED\nTO THIS VEGETABLE GARDEN, BEYOND THE OBVIOUS REASONS THAT I AM A\nCARD-CARRYING MEMBER OF THE LIBERAL VEGETABLE LOBBY.\nBUT IF THERE IS A STEADY STREAM OF IMAGES IN BILL CLINTON\nTILLING THE SOIL, DEADHEADING STUFF, THAT WOULD BE A LEGACY TO\nCELEBRATE. THAT DOES IT FOR US TONIGHT.\nNOW IT'S TIME FOR \"THE LAST WORD\", WITH LAWRENCE O'DONNELL.\n>> ANY WORD FROM MELANIA TRUMP ON THE VEGETABLE GARDEN?\n>> NO, BUT I THINK MY PHONE IS BROKEN.\nI HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HER IN A LONG TIME.\n>> WE'RE FOLLOWING BREAKING NEWS TONIGHT, INVOLVING MIKE PENCE'S\nCAMPAIGN AIRPLANE.

DONALD TRUMP SHOULD NOT HAVE\nTHIS STATE AS COMPETITIVE AT ALL.\n>> CAN YOU MAP OUT A SCENARIO? MAKING A DIFFERENCE FOR TRUMP?\n>> WITHOUT A DOUBT AND SHOULD FRIGHTEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.\nTHIS IS THE BATTLEGROUND MAP. I'M GOING TO GIVE DONALD TRUMP\nTHE BATTLEGROUND STATES AND FLIP NEW HAMPSHIRE AND GIVING HIM\nTHAT ONE ELECTORAL VOTE IN MAINE, GET HIM TO 270.\nTHIS IS THE WINNING MAP FOR DONALD TRUMP THAT KELLYANNE\nCONWAY SAYS SHE'S GOING TO PLAY. BUT LOOK NOW.\nIF EVAN McMULLEN WINS IN UTAH, HE LOSES THOSE ELECTORAL\nVOTES HE'S DOWN TO 264, THIS GETS THROWN TO THE HOUSE OF\nREPRESENTATIVES. >> AND IT GOES ON AND ON.\nTHAINKS VERY MUCH. EVAN McMULLEN IS THE WILD CARD\nIN UTAH. IF HE TAKES VOTES FROM TRUMP AND\nCARRIES CLINTON TO VICTORY, SMOG NOT HAPPENED SINCE THE '60s.\nCAUGHT UP WITH McMULLEN. >> Reporter: THE CLOCK IS\nTICKING, RACING FROM ONE EVENT TO THE NEXT, INTERVIEWS ON TV\nNETWORKS. THE UNLIKELY THIRD PARTY\nCANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UTAH BALLOT, A CONSERVATIVE,\nMORMON IN HEAVILY MORMON STATE, OHIO POLLS SHOWING GRABBING\nNEARLY A QUARTER OF MORMON VOTERS.\nIF HE WINS IN UTAH HE'D BE THE FIRST INDEPENDENT OR THIRD PAERD\nCANDIDATE SINCE 196 TO WIN A STATE'S ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES.\nDO YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE A SPOILER?\n>> I DON'T. I THINK WE'VE GOT TO TEAR\nOURSELVES AWAY FROM THIS IDEA IT HAS TO BE THE REPUBLICANS OR THE\nDEMOCRATS. >> WE WENT TO A REPUBLICAN EVENT\nYOU'RE NOT VERY POPULAR THERE. >> YES, RIGHT.\nYOU MEAN DONALD TRUMP EVENT. >> YES.\n>> YES. >> TRUMP, TRUMP, TRUMP!\n>> HE'S USURPING THE VOICE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\nTHE AMERICAN VOTER SELECTED THE CANDIDATE.\n>> Reporter: McMULLEN IS A BAD WORD IN THIS CROWD HERE AT RALLY\nFOR MIKE PENCE TAKING ON McMULLEN DIRECTLY.\n>> THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER THERE'S ONLY TWO NAMES ON THE\nBALLOT THAT HAVE A CHANCE TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES\nOF AMERICA. >> IF HE WINS THE STATE OF UTAH?\n>> THEN HE WON THE STATE OF OUT THAT'S IT, WOW.\nHE'S NOT PRESIDENT. >> Reporter: BUT HIS CAMPAIGN\nHAS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. DEMOCRATS ARE FOR HIM.\n-- FORGING INTO UTAH. HILLARY CLINTON CLOSING THE\nPOLLS WITH TRUMP AS McMULLEN SIPHONS TRUMP VOTERS.\nBRIGHT RED REPUBLICAN UTAH, NOW A BATTLEGROUND STATE.\nWHAT DO YOU SAY TO THEM WHEN THEY SAY YOU ARE WRECKING THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY? >> I WOULD DISAGREE VERY\nSTRONGLY WITH THAT. I WOULD SAY THAT DONALD TRUMP\nHAS PULLED THE PARTY AWAY FROM CONSERVATIVE VALUES AND DONALD\nTRUMP HAS PULLED THE PARTY TOWARDS POPULISM AND TOWARDS\nWHITE NATIONALISM. >> AT McMULLIN MEET AND GREET WE\nMEET AARON AND KENDALL PEARSON LIFELONG REPUBLICANS WHO\nHAVE A VISIBLE REACTION TO TRUMP.\nCOULD YOU VOTE FOR HIM EVER? >> I DON'T THINK SO.\n>> I DON'T THINK SO. >> I DON'T THINK SO.\n THE THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE VOTING FOR EVAN LETS THE\nGOVERNMENT KNOW THERE'S A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE NOT HAPPY\nWITH HOW THE ELECTION PROCESS HAS HAPPENED THIS TIME.\nSO I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IT'S THROWING AWAY YOUR\nVOTE. >> Reporter: McMULLIN IS FAR\nFROM POLISHED POLITICIAN AND STRUGGLES\nWITH NAME RECOGNITION. >> WHO HE IS?\n>> EVAN McMULLIN AND RUNS FOR PRESIDENT ON THE BALLOT IN UTAH.\n>> OH, GOOD FOR HIM. >> Reporter: IF HE WINS IN UTAH,\nBANK SIX ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES THAT TRUMP WOULD NOT\nHAVE, SIX THAT COULD BLOCK TRUMP'S RUN TO 270 AND TO\nMcMULLIN THAT'S A CLEAR REFERENDUM ON CHANGE.\n>> WE AT LEAST NEED A NEW CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT WHETHER WE\nNEED A NEW POLITICAL PARTY NEED TO BE DETERMINED.\nBUT WE NEED SOMETHING NEW IN THIS COUNTRY.\nTHAT'S FOR SURE. >> KIM JOINS ME FROM SALT LAKE\nCITY. FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, McMULLIN\nIS ON THE BALLOT ELSEWHERE, IS IT POSSIBLE HE COULD HAVE A\nLARGER NATIONAL IMPACT? >> HE'S MOST PROMINENT HERE BUT\nHE IS ON THE BALLOT AND COULD BE A WRITE-IN CANDIDATE BUT HE\nKNOWS IT'S LATE. HE KNOWS 2016 THE BEST HE COULD\nPROBABLY DO IS TO MAKE SOME SORT OF STATEMENT.\nYOU HEARD HIM THERE NEW CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT THAT'S\nWHAT HE'S GUNNING FOR. HE AND THE PEOPLE AROUND HIM\nTHERE ARE SOME SIGNIFICANT REPUBLICAN OPERATIVES WORKING\nWITH HIM, LOOKING AT THIS NEW CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT WITHIN THE\nGOP OR AS AN INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY FOR 2020.\n>> THANKS. UP NEXT WHEN PUSH COMES TO SHOVE\nON CAPITOL HILL, SOME REPUBLICANS WHO SAID WOULDN'T\nENDORSE TRUMP ARE NOW CHANGING",

I DESERVE IT BY VIRTUE OF ME\nBEING ME. SO IT OFFERS AN INSIGHT.\nTHIS TAPE FROM THE TRUMP BIOGRAPHER WHICH PROVIDED IT TO\n\"THE NEW YORK TIMES,\" I THINK THIS IS NEWSWORTHY TAPE, AND I\nTHINK IT IS HELPFUL TO UNDERSTANDING HOW DONALD TRUMP\nIS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT NOW, BECAUSE HE ON TAPE HERE TALKS IN\nTHIS VERY UNGUARDED WAY ABOUT HOW HE SEES HIMSELF AND THAT IS\nA RARE THING WE DON'T EVER GET FROM ANY CANDIDATE, LET ALONE\nFROM HIM. BUT THERE IS ANOTHER PIECE OF\nTHIS TAPE THAT HAS NEVER BEEN HEARD PUBLICLY BEFORE, WHICH WE\nHAVE GOT FOR YOU IN JUST A SECOND.\nAND THIS OTHER PIECE OF TAPE, I THINK THIS IS JUST LIKE A DART\nINTO THE HEART OF TODAY'S NEWS. AND IT'S ON A SUBJECT THAT HAS\nONLY COME UP A LITTLE BIT IN THE CAMPAIGN SO FAR.\nIT CAME UP FOR AN INSTANT EARLIER IN THIS CAMPAIGN WHEN\nDONALD TRUMP NAMED MIKE PENCE TO BE HIS RUNNING MATE.\nONE OF THE CONTROVERSIAL THINGS IN MIKE PENCE'S RECORD IS THAT\nHE IS ON RECORD BEING AGAINST WOMEN IN THE MILITARY.\nFROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF HIM RUNNING FOR CONGRESS, MIKE PENCE\nWAS AGAINST NOT JUST WOMEN IN COMBAT, BUT EVEN WOMEN BEING IN\nCOMBAT SUPPORT UNITS. HE WAS EVEN AGAINST WOMEN BEING\nALLOWED TO DO BASIC TRAINING FOR THE MILITARY.\nMIKE PENCE WROTE THIS CREEPY COLUMN IN 1999 ABOUT YOUNG\nNUBILE 18-YEAR-OLD WOMEN IN BASIC TRAINING.\nTHE COLUMN ENDS WITH THIS LINE, I KID YOU NOT.\nWOMEN IN THE MILITARY, BAD IDEA. THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE OF HIS\nCOLUMN ON WOMEN IN THE MILITARY. SO THAT'S ON RECORD ALREADY FROM\nMIKE PENCE, DONALD TRUMP'S RUNNING MATE, WHEN PENCE WAS A\nTALK RADIO HOST. THAT WAS THE TIME HE LOST\nRUNNING FOR CONGRESS. THAT RUN MOST REMEMBERED FOR\nMIKE PENCE USING CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS TO PAY FOR HIS\nMORTGAGE, HIS GROCERY BILLS, HIS CAR PAYMENT AND HIS GOLFING\nFEES. HE LET HIS DONORS PAY FOR ALL\nTHAT STUFF. IF MIKE PENCE WERE RUNNING IN\nANY NORMAL REPUBLICAN, I THINK HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A SCANDAL AS\nA RUNNING MATE. THINGS IN HIS RECORD WOULD HAVE\nBEEN A SCANDAL AND A PROBLEM TO HIS RUNNING MATE.\nIT IS TESTAMENT TO DONALD TRUMP THAT HE IS SO CONTROVERSIAL THAT\nPICKING MIKE PENCE WITH MIKE PENCE'S RECORD, IT HASN'T GIVEN\nDONALD TRUMP A SINGLE DAY OF HEARTBURN IN THE ENTIRE\nCAMPAIGN. I MEAN IF IN THIS CAMPAIGN\nANYBODY COULD PAY ATTENTION TO MIKE PENCE FOR MORE THAN TEN\nSECONDS WITHOUT PASSING OUT FOR LACK OF OXYGEN, THIS THING FROM\nHIM ABOUT WOMEN IN THE MILITARY, BAD IDEA, THAT WOULD BE A\nSCANDAL, RIGHT? THAT WOULD BE A PROBLEM FOR A\nCAMPAIGN. MAYBE IT WILL BE STILL SOME DAY.\nFOR A LONG TIME I FELT LIKE THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN A LURKING\nLIABILITY FOR TRUMP AND PENCE, JUST SORT OF WAITING AT SOME\nPOINT TO CAUSE THEM TROUBLE. WELL, NOW THAT TROUBLE MAY\nFINALLY BE COMING TO PASS, BECAUSE NOW WITH THIS NEW TAPE\nTHAT WE ARE ABOUT TO BROADCAST FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, THIS\nHAS NEVER BEEN HEARD PUBLICLY ANY TIME BEFORE, THIS IS THE\nFIRST TIME ANYWHERE, HERE IS DONALD TRUMP NOT 16 YEARS AGO OR\n18 YEARS AGO WHEN MIKE PENCE WAS TALKING ABOUT THIS STUFF, HERE'S\nDONALD TRUMP TWO YEARS AGO IN 2014, UNPROMPTED, ANSWERING A\nTOTALLY UNRELATED QUESTION. JUST DECIDING TO BRING UP\nVOLUNTARILY HIS DONALD TRUMP OPINION ON WOMEN IN THE\nMILITARY. >> WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG, WHAT DID\nYOU THINK OF THE '60s COUNTERCULTURE, THE HIPPIES, THE\nMUSIC? YOU DIDN'T DO ANY OF THAT STUFF.\n>> NO, I WASN'T INTO IT. IT WASN'T THAT I WASN'T INTO IT.\n>> WHAT DID YOU THINK? >> WELL, I WENT -- I WENT TO A\nMILITARY ACADEMY, WHICH WAS FROM A DIFFERENT PLANET.\nWE DIDN'T HAVE THAT. AND WE DIDN'T HAVE WOMEN IN THE\nACADEMY AT THAT TIME. TODAY YOU HAVE WOMEN, WHICH IS A\nWHOLE OTHER STORY, YOU KNOW, WOMEN IN THE ARMY, AND YOU SEE\nWHAT'S GOING ON. IT'S LIKE BEDLAM.\nIT IS BEDLAM. IT'S SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE\nAREN'T TALKING ABOUT, BUT WHAT'S GOING ON IS BEDLAM, BRINGING\nWOMEN IN THE ARMY. >> BRINGING WOMEN IN THE ARMY,\nWOMEN IN THE MILITARY, IT'S BEDLAM.\nAND HIS RUNNING MATE SAYS WOMEN IN THE MILITARY, BAD IDEA.\nASK MILITARY FAMILIES HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT THAT IN A POTENTIAL\nCOMMANDER IN CHIEF. ASK WOMEN IN THE MILITARY HOW\nTHEY FEEL ABOUT THAT IN A POTENTIAL COMMANDER IN CHIEF.\nASK WOMEN IN GENERAL HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT THAT.\nBRINGING WOMEN INTO THE ARMY, BEDLAM.\nIT'S SOMETHING PEOPLE AREN'T TALKING ABOUT, BUT WHAT'S GOING\nON IS BEDLAM. BRINGING WOMEN IN THE ARMY, IT'S\nBEDLAM. WOMEN IN THE MILITARY, BAD IDEA.\nTHE TWO OF THEM ARE IN LINE ON THAT QUESTION.\nIT IS, THEREFORE, A REASONABLE QUESTION TO ASK IF TRUMP AND\nPENCE DO GET ELECTED, WILL THEY KICK ALL WOMEN OUT OF THE\nMILITARY? THEY'RE BOTH ON RECORD SAYING IT\nIS A TERRIBLE THING THAT WOMEN ARE IN THE MILITARY.\nIT'S A TERRIBLE THING, IT'S EVEN A DISGUSTING THING.\nWE OUGHT TO GO BACK TO ONLY MEN SERVING IN THE MILITARY.\nIS THAT WHAT WE SHOULD DO? THIS ONE HAS BEEN LURKING JUST\nUNDER THE SURFACE FOR THEM FOR QUITE A WHILE, BUT NOW WE'VE GOT\nIT ON TAPE.",

GOVERNOR PENCE'S PLANE SKIDDED\nOFF THE RUNWAY TONIGHT AT LaGUARDIA AIRPORT.\nEVERYBODY ON BOARD IS FINE, THERE WERE NO INJURIES REPORTED\nINCLUDING TO GOVERNOR PENCE OR HIS FAMILY.\nTHERE WERE BETWEEN 30 AND 40 PEOPLE ON BOARD THE GOVERNOR'S\nJET, IT'S A CHARTERED 737. GOVERNOR PENCE, HIS WIFE, ONE OF\nHIS KIDS, ABOUT 15 SECRET SERVICE AGENTS AND A DOZEN\nMEMBERS OF THE PRESS WERE ON THAT PLANE.\nWE ALSO THINK WE SAW A CONGRESSMAN FROM TEXAS.\nWE HEARD THAT A 737 USUALLY COMES IN FOR A LANDING AT 155\nMILES AN HOUR AND WHEN IT'S A WET, SLICK NIGHT LIKE TONIGHT,\nTHIS KIND OF THING CAN HAPPEN. BUT THE FAA AND MAYBE THE NTSB\nWILL BE LOOKING INTO THIS INCIDENT TO DETERMINE EXACTLY\nWHAT CAUSED IT HERE. I'LL SHOW YOU AGAIN, THIS IS\nWHAT THE PLANE DID TO THE TARMAC AT LaGUARDIA AS IT SLID OFF THE\nRUNWAY. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THAT HAPPENED\nWHEN YOU SLID OFF A RUNWAY. ALL THE AIR TRAFFIC AT LaGUARDIA\nWAS SUSPENDED FOR OVER AN HOUR IN THE WAKE OF THIS INCIDENT.\nWE ARE TOLD AS SOON AS THE PLANE CAME TO A REST FOLLOWING ITS\nROUGH LANDING AND ITS SLIDE INTO THE GRASS WITH MUD FLYING UP AND\nHITTING THE WINDOWS, GOVERNOR PENCE IMMEDIATELY CAME TO THE\nBACK OF THE PLANE TO CHECK THAT EVERYBODY WAS OKAY.\nGOD BLESS HIM, THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO.\nAS YOU CAN SEE HE'S FINE. HE ALSO STOPPED WITH PHOTOS WITH\nFIRST RESPONDERS IN THE RAIN. HE HAD BEEN SCHEDULED TO ATTEND\nA FUND-RAISER IN NEW YORK CITY TONIGHT BUT HIS SPOKESMAN SAID\nINSTEAD HE IS HEADED TO HIS HOTEL FOR THE NIGHT, ABSOLUTELY\nTOTALLY UNDERSTANDABLE. ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER THE INCIDENT\nTHE GOVERNOR TWEETED SO THANKFUL EVERYONE ON OUR PLANE IS SAFE.\nGRATEFUL FOR OUR FIRST RESPONDERS AND THE CONCERN AND\nPRAYERS OF SO MANY. BACK ON THE TRAIL TOMORROW.\nAGAIN, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING HERE IS NO INJURIES AS FAR AS WE\nKNOW. BUT CERTAINLY SOME JANGLED\nNERVES AND SOME RUSHES OF ADRENALINE AND NONE OF US NEED\nANY OF THAT AT THIS TIME. JOINING US NOW IS A MAN ONBOARD\nTHAT PLANE, VAUGHN HILLYARD. HE WAS ON THE PLANE WHEN IT SLID\nOFF THE RUNWAY. VAUGHN, LET ME SHAKE YOUR HAND.\nI'M GLAD YOU'RE OKAY. WERE YOU SCARED?\n>> NO. THE CRAZY PART IS THIS WASN'T\nTHE FIRST TIME -- FIRST TIME WE'VE GONE OFF THE RUNWAY, BUT\nWE'VE HAD A LOT OF SHAKY INCIDENTS IN THE PAST.\nHARD IMPACT, TOUGH LANDINGS. WE ACTUALLY PULLED OUT THE PHONE\nTHIS TIME AND I SNAPPED ORIGINALLY ABOUT TEN SECONDS OF\nVIDEO, WHICH I'M TRYING TO GET INTO THE SYSTEM HERE EVENTUALLY\nFOR EVERYBODY, BUT THE CRAZY PART WAS ORIGINALLY WE HAD THE\nHARD IMPACT AND THEN WE WENT TWO OR THREE SECONDS AND THAT'S WITH\nWE STARTED TO SWERVE OFF TO THE RIGHT.\nAND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN WE COME TO JUST A HARD CRASHING STOP.\nAND THAT'S WHEN YOU LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW AND YOU CAN SEE THAT\nTHE ROAD WAS ODDLY CLOSE TO WHERE THE PLANE WAS AT.\n>> THE ROAD WITH CARS ON IT. >> THE ROAD WITH CARS.\nTHE CIRCLE K ACROSS THE STREET. THAT'S WHEN IT BECAME REAL.\n>> SO WHEN YOU SAY YOU WERE TRYING TO GET TAPE, YOU WERE\nFILMING AS YOU WERE LANDING. IS THAT BECAUSE YOU WERE\nEXPECTING A HARD LANDING BECAUSE YOU'VE HAD SO MANY?\n>> IT'S A JOKE. IT'S A JOKE HOW LONG ARE WE\nGOING TO LAST. THAT'S THE PART THE FACT THAT\nI'M ON WITH YOU TONIGHT IS SORT OF THE INTERESTING END OF THIS.\nTHIS CAMERA, WE'VE CAPTURED A LOT OF CRAZY THINGS IN THIS\nCAMPAIGN, BUT TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE THIS IS THE NEWS OF\nTHE NIGHT WAS -- >> WAIT A SECOND.\nYOU'RE SAYING IT'S BECOME A JOKE HOW LONG ARE WE GOING TO LAST.\nYOU'RE SAYING THAT THE HARD LANDINGS ON THE PENCE CAMPAIGN\nPLANE SPECIFICALLY ARE SO FREQUENT AND SO NOTABLE THAT\nIT'S A POINT OF DISCUSSION AMONG THE PRESS CORPS?\n>> YES. AND I'LL BE HONEST THAT I'VE\nNEVER PURSUED THAT. WE HAVEN'T PURSUED ASKING\nQUESTIONS FURTHER ABOUT THAT BECAUSE USUALLY WE DON'T FLY ON\nPRIVATE, I GUESS, CHARTER FLIGHTS ON CAMPAIGN.\nTHIS IS MY FIRST CAMPAIGN COVERING SO WE JUST TOOK IT FOR\nGRANTED. >> HAVE YOU ONLY HAD BAD\nLANDINGS IN HEAVY WEATHER? >> NO.\nWE LANDED IN FT. DODGE, IOWA, EARLIER AND WE HAD ANOTHER ROUGH\nLANDING WHERE WE HIT. IT FELT LIKE WE WENT BACK INTO\nTHE AIR. YOU COULD SEE THE BLUE SKY\nAGAIN. OF COURSE WE DIDN'T GO OFF THE\nRUNWAY AT THAT POINT. >> I'M JUST GOING TO PUT THIS TO\nYOU. I'VE GOT A -- I WENT BACK AND\nLOOKED AT MY EARLIER COVERAGE ABOUT SOMETHING INVOLVING THE\nMIKE PENCE CAMPAIGN. I AM SURE THIS IS JUST\nCOINCIDENTAL, BUT THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT WE ON THIS\nSHOW HAVE TALKED ABOUT ISSUES INVOLVING MIKE PENCE'S CAMPAIGN\nPLANE. AND I'VE NEVER BEEN ON THAT\nCAMPAIGN PLANE SO IT'S NOT LIKE I WAS REPORTING A PERSONAL\nEXPERIENCE. IT WAS LATE LAST MONTH WE\nLEARNED THAT THE PILOT, WHO IS ENTRUSTED WITH THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN WITH FLYING THE PENCE CAMPAIGN AND HIS PRESS CORPS AND\nHIS FAMILY AROUND THE COUNTRY, HE MADE NEWS BECAUSE HE WAS\nFIRED FOR AN UNUSUAL REASON. THE GUARDIAN WAS FIRST TO REPORT\nTHAT THE PILOT FOR THE PENCE PLANE UNTIL ONE MONTH AGO WAS A\nRETIRED POLICE OFFICER IN ADDITION TO BEING PENCE'S PILOT.\nHE WAS THE CHAIRMAN OF DONALD TRUMP'S FLORIDA LAW ENFORCEMENT\nCOALITION. AND \"THE GUARDIAN\" REPORTED THAT\nHE WAS ACTIVELY FACING CRIMINAL CHARGES OF AGGRAVATED BATTERY\nWITH A DEADLY WEAPON. IN 2015 HE HAD ALLEGEDLY DRIVEN\nOVER A CO-WORKER WITH HIS CAR THREE TIMES ON PURPOSE, CAUSING\nTHE CO-WORKER SEVERE PHYSICAL INJURIES.\nHIS NAME IS VINCENT CALDERA. HE PLED NOT GUILTY TO THOSE\nCHARGES BUT IT TURNED OUT THOSE WEREN'T THE ONLY CHARGES AGAINST\nHIM. HE WAS ACCUSED OF A SIMILAR\nINCIDENT IN 2014. IN THAT CASE HE WAS ACCUSED OF\nDRIVING INTO A WOMAN WITH HIS MOTORCYCLE ON PURPOSE AND\nSERIOUSLY INJURING HER. \"THE GUARDIAN\" REPORTED LAST\nMONTH HE HADN'T ACTUALLY BEEN FORMALLY CHARGED IN RELATION TO\nTHAT EPISODE BECAUSE THEY HADN'T BEEN ABLE TO LOCATE HIM TO SERVE\nHIM WITH LEGAL PAPERS. MEANWHILE HE'S FLYING THE VICE\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AROUND THE COUNTRY.\nSO THAT'S THE PILOT WHO GOT FIRED FROM THE PENCE CAMPAIGN\nPLANE LAST MONTH. DO YOU KNOW WHO THEY REPLACED\nHIM WITH? >> I DO NOT KNOW WHO THE\nGENTLEMAN IS. THEY SWITCH PEOPLE OUT.\n>> SO IT'S ROTATING? >> SO IT'S A ROTATING BASIS,\nYEAH. >> HOW OLD ARE YOU?\n>> 25. >> HAVE YOU DONE A LOT OF FLYING\nIN YOUR REPORTING JOB AND IN YOUR PERSONAL LIFE?\n>> YES. >> IS THE PENCE CAMPAIGN PLANE\nTHE ONLY CAMPAIGN PLANE ON WHICH YOU HAVE HAD HARD LANDINGS LIKE\nTHIS? >> THAT'S ACCURATE.\n>> THAT'S REALLY WEIRD. JOHN HILLYARD.\nI DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RELATIONSHIP IS BETWEEN THESE\nTWO HALVES OF THIS STORY, BUT KNOWING THAT THIS RUNWAY THING\nHAPPENED TONIGHT AFTER A SERIES OF HARD LANDINGS THAT WAS A\nTOPIC OF DISCUSSION BY YOU GUYS, IT WEIRDS ME OUT AND WE WILL TRY\nTO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT. AND I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE OKAY.\nTHANKS. APPRECIATE IT.\nNBC NEWS EMBED VAUGHN HILLYARD.",

WHICH MEANS HAD A SIGNIFICANT\nTAIL WIND COMPONENT. WHAT THAT MEANS IS AIRCRAFT\nRELATIVE TO THE GROUND WOULD BE GOING FASTER THAN NORMAL.\nYOU'VE GOT A REALLY BAD COMBINATION OF THINGS HAPPENING\nHERE. YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF WATER ON THE\nRUNWAY AND BRAKING ACTION IS NOT WHAT YOU WOULD HOPE IT TO BE.\nAND AIRCRAFT TRAVELING FASTER THAN NORMALLY WOULD BE UNDER\nIDEAL CIRCUMSTANCES.

INFORMATION THAT MILES AND I GOT\nAFTER THE FIRST TALK. BOTHERS ME THAT THEY WERE FLYING\nDOWNWIDE, AND MILES SAID TRYING TO GO INTO THE WIND FOR THE\nDOWNSPEED ADVANTAGE. WITH THE WIND IS NOT GOOD A\nSITUATION, PARTICULARLY IN A RAINY RUNWAY, TALKING ABOUT A\nHIGH SPEED LANDIN COMPARED TO FLYING INTO THE WIND AND WET\nRUNWAY ON TOP OF THAT. BRAKING ACTION IMPAIRED TO SOME\nDEGREE WHICH WOULD INCREASE THE PROBABILITY BE IN A HYDROPLANE\nSITUATION WHERE THE AIRCRAFT WOULDN'T HAVE THAT CONTROL OR\nDIRECT CONTACT WITH THE RUNWAY AND SLIDE AROUND AS WAS\nDESCRIBED EARLIER.

THIS MEANS IT WORKED AND WE\nSHOULD BE HAPPY AND GLAD THAT FAA -- WE SAY OFTEN AND DAVID\nWILL ATTEST TO THIS, IT'S A SAD STATEMENT, BUT THE RULES ARE\nWRITTEN IN BLOOD WHEN IT COMES TO AVIATION, WE HAVE ACCIDENTS,\nOVERRUNS AND PROBLEMS, AND FAA AND REGULATORY BODY RESPONDS.\nTHAT'S WHAT MAKES IT SO SAFE, AS LONG AS YOU LISTEN TO WHAT\nHAPPENS IN THE PREVIOUS ACCIDENTS AND PUT IN THINGS LIKE\nTHIS, DON'T END UP WITH SITUATION IN MID-90s WHEN U.S.\nAIRWAYS WENT OFF THE EDGE IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES.\n>> IT'S SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE THIS, DOES THE PLANE SINK INTO\nTHAT AND THAT SLOWS DOWN THE PLANE FINALLY?\n>> EXACTLY.

SHE WAS AFRAID TO WRITE?\nWOULD HAVE GOTTEN THE PULITZER PRIZE.\nGIVE ME A BREAK. >> Reporter: TRUMP MAKING A RARE\nAPPEARANCE WITH WIFE MELANIA. SHE'S MORE FOCUSED THAN RAISING\nBARRON THAN HITTING THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\n>> MY PRIORITIES ARE ON OUR SON BARRON AND I SUPPORT HIM 100%\nAND I'M THERE FOR HIM EVERY TIME HE NEEDS ME AND I WILL JOIN HIM.\n>> HER HUSBAND HAS OTHER IDEAS. >> SHE'S AMAZING WHEN SHE\nSPEAKS, AN AMAZING PUBLIC SPEAKER SO SHE'S AGREED TO DO\nTWO OR THREE SPEECHES AND I THINK IT WILL BE BIG SPEECHES,\nIMPORTANT SPEECHES. >> Reporter: WITH LESS THAN TWO\nWEEKS UNTIL ELECTION DAY REPUBLICANS ARE STILL GRAPPLING\nWITH HOW TO DEAL WITH THEIR NOMINEE.\nAFTER PULLING HIS ENDORSEMENT OF TRUMP WEEKS AGO --\n>> I CAN ONLY ANSWER TO MYSELF AND MY WIFE AND I GOT TO FEEL\nGOOD ABOUT WHAT I DO. >> Reporter: UTAH CONGRESSMAN\nJASON CHAFFETZ SAYS HE'LL VOTE FOR TRUMP AFTER ALL TWEETING \"I\nWILL NOT DEFEND OR ENDORSE DONALD TRUMP BUT I AM VOTING FOR\nHIM. HRC IS THAT BAD.\"\nHRC IS BAD FOR THE USA. >> JOINS US FROM GENEVA, OHIO.\nDID TRUMP MAKE ANY MENTION OF HIS\nHIS RUNNING MATE TONIGHT? >> HE DID MENTION AT THE END OF\nTHE SPEECH HE TOLD THIS OHIO CROWD HE SPOKE TO MIKE PENCE AND\nEXPLAINED THAT HIS RUNNING MATE'S PLANE SKIDDED OFF THE\nRUNWAY. HE SAID PENCE WAS CLOSE TO GRAVE\nDANGER BUT HE ASSURED THE CROWD EVERYTHING\nIS FINE AND OF COURSE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM OUR\nPRODUCE ARE ELIZABETH LANDERS AT THE SCENE.\nAND ALSO LEARNING THAT MIKE PENCE WILL BE BACK ON THE\nCAMPAIGN TRAIL TOMORROW. SENIOR ADVISER\nSAYING NOTHING CAN SLOW DOWN THE TICKET IN THE LAST WEEK OR SO.\n>> THANK YOU SO MUCH. HILLARY CLINTON AND MICHELLE\nOBAMA CAMPAIGNED TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NORTH\nCAROLINA. MRS. OBAMA HAS BEEN LOGGING A\nLOT OF TIME STUMPING FOR CLINTON, SOLO APPEARANCES\nAND JOINING HER TODAY SHE'S BROKEN NEW GROUND.\nMORE ON WHAT IT MEANS TO THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN ESPECIALLY WHAT\nIT SAYS TO CLINTON SUPPORTERS. SOME OF WHOM WOULD PROBABLY\nPREFER TO SEE THE CURRENT FIRST LADY AT TOP OF THE TICKET.\nRANDI KAYE WAS IN WINSTON-SALEM TALKING TO VOTERS.\n>> YOU GUYS ARE PRETTY FIRED UP, RIGHT?\nI LIKE THAT. >> Reporter: FIRST LADY MICHELLE\nOBAMA SHARING A STAGE WITH HILLARY CLINTON FOR THE FIRST\nTIME, A DOUBLE DOSE OF DEMOCRATIC WOMEN THRILLED\nSUPPORTERS. HOW IMPORTANT IS IT TO YOU THAT\nMICHELLE OBAMA IS SUPPORTING HILLARY CLINTON AND CAMPAIGNING\nWITH HER IN TERMS OF YOUR SUPPORT?\n>> I STILL WOULD SUPPORT HILLARY WITHOUT MICHELLE BUT I THINK\nTHAT IS AN UNBELIEVABLY BIG BONUS FOR HILLARY.\nMICHELLE IS THE CLASSIEST PRESIDENTIAL WIFE WE'VE EVER\nHAD. >> SHE CREATES A LOT OF\nENTHUSIASM. I THINK SHE BRINGS VITALITY.\nLOTS OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK PEOPLE ARE NOT NECESSARILY\nSEEING IN HILLARY EVEN THOUGH THEY BELIEVE IN HER MESSAGE.\n>> HILLARY HAS DONE HER JOB. NOW, WE NEED TO DO OUR JOB.\nAND GET HER ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\n>> MRS. OBAMA'S FANS BELIEVE SHE IS UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO PULL\nALL KINDS OF VOTERS INTO CLINTON'S CAMP, VOTERS LIKE\nVAF THAT REDMOND, A 20-YEAR-OLD MILLENIAL AND FORMER BERNIE\nSANDERS SUPPORTER WHO ADMIRES MICHELLE OBAMA.\n>> SHE GETS TO SHOW BLACK GIRL MAGIC, SHOW OUR POINT OF VIEW\nAND A GOOD FEMINIST AND WOMAN EMPOWERMENT ICON.\n>> Reporter: A DRAW FOR THIS MILLENNIAL TOO.\n>> SHE SPEAKS TO ISSUES AND SORT OF SPEAKS OUR LANGUAGE.\n>> Reporter: HOW MANY OF YOU WANT TO SEE THE FIRST WOMAN\nPRESIDENT? ALL OF YOU.\n>> I THINK IT'S FANTASTIC THAT SHE CHOSE TO SUPPORT HILLARY AND\nBRING IN ALL THE WOMEN. WE REALLY NEED THAT SUPPORT FROM\nNOT ONLY FEMALES BUT THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN AS WELL.\nIF SHE SUPPORTS AND WE'LL SUPPORT HER.\nBECAUSE THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY AT LARGE REALLY\nBELIEVES IN MICHELLE OBAMA. >> Reporter: AS THE TWO WOMEN\nHUGGED ON STAGE AT THIS RALLY, SUPPORTERS WERE REMINDED OF A\nDIFFERENT TIME. CLINTON'S BITTER 2008 CAMPAIGN\nAGAINST SENATOR BARACK OBAMA. BACK THEN THINGS GOT PERSONAL.\n>> OUR VIEW WAS THAT IF YOU CAN'T RUN YOUR OWN HOUSE YOU\nCERTAINLY CAN'T RUN THE WHITE HOUSE.\n>> Reporter: MRS. OBAMA DENIED THAT QUIP WAS DIRECTED AT MRS.\nCLINTON. AFTER PRESIDENT OBAMA NAMED\nCLINTON AS HIS SECRETARY OF STATE, THE TENSION BETWEEN THE\nTWO WOMEN REPORTEDLY CONTINUED. BUT TODAY, THEY ARE PARTNERS,\nHOPING TO TAKE DOWN DONALD TRUMP.\nHOW DID YOU FEEL TO HEAR MICHELLE OBAMA SAY HILLARY\nCLINTON IS MY FRIEND? >> IT WAS AMAZING AND AN EXAMPLE\nFOR ALL OF US, A SISTERHOOD. THEY WERE TOGETHER AND WE'RE ALL\nTOGETHER IN THIS. >> Reporter: WHAT DID YOU SEE\nBETWEEN THESE TWO WOMEN TODAY? >> LOVE, UNITY, TOTAL AND\nCOMPLETE SUPPORT. >> IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER\nTHAN BEING HERE WITH OUR MOST AMAZING FIRST LADY.\n>> Reporter: ESPECIALLY WHEN THE FIRST LADY IS KNOWN AS THE\nCLOSER, A NICKNAME SHE EARNED AS THE END OF HER HUSBAND'S\n2008 CAMPAIGN. >> SHE CAN BE A CLOSER\nABSOLUTELY. I'M EXCITED TO BE HERE AND SO\nEXCITED TO VOTE FOR A WOMAN FOR PRESIDENT.\n>> AND RANDI KAYE JOINS FROM US CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA.\nDO YOU GET A SENSE FROM SUPPORTERS THAT MANY OF THEM\nWERE THERE TO SEE MICHELLE OBAMA AND MIGHT NOT HAVE EVEN COME OUT\nTO SEE CLINTON IF SHE HADN'T BEEN THERE?\nOR HAD THEY BEEN TO A LOT OF\nCLINTON RALLIES? >> BEEN TO SOME RALLIES BUT THE\nCROWD TODAY WAS HUGE AND ABSOLUTELY THEY\nWERE THERE TO SEE MICHELLE OBAMA.\nWHO WERE YOU MORE EXCITED TO SEE AND ALMOST EVERY SINGLE PERSON\nTOLD ME THEY WERE THERE TO SEE MICHELLE OBAMA.\nLOT OF PEOPLE SAID THEY'D LIKE TO SEE HER RUN FOR PRESIDENT\nONE DAY. MAYBE IN 2020.\nONE WOMAN TOLD ME IF MICHELLE OBAMA AND HILLARY CLINTON WERE\nON THE SAME PRESIDENTIAL TICKET, ABSOLUTELY VOTE FOR MICHELLE\nOBAMA. IT'S NOT JUST WOMEN.\nSHE'S VERY POPULAR AMONG THAT CROWD WITH THE MEN IN THE CROWD,\nYOUNG AND OLD, BLACK AND WHITE, YOU NAME IT AND SHE'S REALLY\nBRINGING IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS INTO THE TENT FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON. I TALKED TO MANY OF THEM WHO HAD\nFELT OVER THIS CAMPAIGN THEY HAVEN'T HAD A HERO IN THE RACE\nWITHOUT BARACK OBAMA, NOT FEELING THE SAME PASSION FOR\nHILLARY CLINTON. AND I THINK JUDGING FROM WHAT I\nHEARD TODAY, FOUND THEIR HERO IN THE RACE AND IT'S MICHELLE\nOBAMA. >> THANKS VERY MUCH.\nTHE PANEL IS BACK WITH US THIS HOUR.\nIT IS INTERESTING TO SEE YOU HEAR IN THAT REPORT THEY MAYBE\nONCE HAD MORE OF A ROCKY RELATIONSHIP.\nCLEARLY MICHELLE OBAMA SEES HER HUSBAND'S LEGACY AT STAKE HERE\nAS MUCH AS ANYTHING ELSE. >> WITHOUT A DOUBT.\nSHE IS ALL IN ON THE HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN AND IN A WAY\nSHE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN WHEN THIS STARTED OUT.\nWOULD HAVE DONE WHAT WAS ASKED OF HER BUT\nSHE HAS SEEN THIS QUEST THAT HILLARY CLINTON AND HER TEAM\nHAVE PUT TOGETHER TO RECREATE THE OBAMA COALITION,\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS, YOUNG VOTERS, LATINO VOTERS AND SHE\nKNOWS THAT SHE AND HER HUSBAND CAN GO A LONG WAY IN\nHELPING HILLARY CLINTON FORM THAT.\nTHEY SEE THAT AS THE PATH TO SUCCESS.\nYOU'RE 100% RIGHT. THIS IS ABOUT A LEGACY BUT IT IS\nNOT JUST ABOUT A LEGACY. I THINK MICHELLE OBAMA REALLY\nDOES BELIEVE IN WHAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN ABOUT.\n>> SHE SPOKE AT THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION BUT HOW BIG WAS THIS\n\"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD\" TAPE? AFTER THAT WE HEARD HER GETTING\nPOWERFUL SPEECH AND THEN THIS SPEECH AGAIN TODAY.\n>> I THINK THAT FIRST OF ALL MICHELLE OBAMA IS THE MOST\nEFFECTIVE COMMUNICATOR ON PLANET EARTH.\nSHE IS BETTER THAN PRESIDENT OBAMA, BETTER THAN BILL CLINTON\nAT HIS BEST, AN EXTRAORDINARY COMMUNICATOR.\nAMAZING TO ME IS ONCE THAT \"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD\" TAPE\nCAME OUT, WHEN SHE CAME OUT SHE WENT RIGHT AFTER DONALD TRUMP\nTHAT WAS BRACING AND HE NEVER FIRED BACK ONCE.\nHE FIRES BACK AT EVERYBODY, A GOLD STAR MOM, WHOEVER YOU ARE.\nIF YOU SAY ONE BAD WORD ABOUT HIM,\nHE'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT YOU FOR FOUR DAYS.\nHE HAS STILL TO THIS DAY NEVER FIRED BACK.\nTHAT GIVES YOU A SENSE OF THE OVERWHELMING POWER IN HIS\nOF HER POPULARITY AND COMMUNICATION.\n>> MY FAVORITE PART WAS YOUNG LADY WHO SAID THAT BLACK GIRL\nMAGIC. THAT SAYS IT ALL.\n>> MILLENIAL SLOGAN. >> EXACTLY.\n>> THE THING ABOUT MICHELLE OBAMA SHE HAS THE MIDAS TOUCH,\nTHE POLITICAL GOLD. SHE HAS EVERYTHING GOING FOR HER\nAND HILLARY CLINTON IS VERY, VERY LUCKY TO HAVE MICHELLE\nOBAMA IN HER CORNER. THING ABOUT MICHELLE OBAMA IS\nSHE SPEAKS LIKE A MOM. SHE DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A\nPOLITICIAN AND THAT'S WHY PEOPLE ARE VERY MUCH DRAWN TO HER.\nSHE SOUND LIKE A WIFE, A MOM, YOU KNOW, AND I THINK IT'S JUST\nAMAZING TO WATCH. >> AS A TRUMP SUPPORTER, DO YOU\nFEAR MICHELLE OBAMA IS THE RIGHT WORD, DO YOU HOPE SHE DOESN'T\nSPEND TOO MUCH MORE TIME OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL?\n>> YES I WOULD SAY SO. I AGREE WITH VAN JONES SHE'S AN\nEXTRAORDINARILY EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATOR, SHE'S VERY GOOD AT\nSPEAKING AND WOULD HAVE A BRIGHT POLITICAL FUTURE.\nTHAT BEING SAID I DON'T KNOW THAT LIKABILITY TRANSLATES.\nIT'S IMPORTANT IN A PRESIDENTIAL RACE, THE CANDIDATE WHO FARES\nBETTER TENDS TO WIN THE ELECTION.\nBOTH CANDIDATES ARE UNLIKEABLE AND UNFAVORABLE.\nI'M NOT SURE MICHELLE OBAMA LIKABILITY TRANSLATES TO THE\nTO THE VOTERS IN THE BOOTH SAYING WHO IS GOING TO BETTER\nOBAMACARE AND THE ECONOMY. I DON'T THINK LIKABILITY OF\nMICHELLE OBAMA IS GOING TO WEIGH IN THAT.\n>> IT COULD IN TERMS OF MILLENIAL VOTERS THERE'S BEEN AN\nENTHUSIASM GAP FOR HILLARY CLINTON PARTICULARLY AMONG\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN MILLENIAL VOTERS.\nMAYBE MAKES A DIFFERENCE THERE. >> I THINK THE QUESTION IS CAN\nWE GO BEYOND INDIVIDUAL SURROGATES AS GREAT ADS MICHELLE\nOBAMA IS AND CAN HILLARY CLINTON TURN THIS INTO A LATE SURGE OF\nENTHUSIASM? IN 1992 YOU SAW IS CRYSTALIZED\nAS YEAR OF THE WOMAN. YOU SAW WOMEN GET SWEPT INTO THE\nSENATE, HELPED BILL CLINTON WIN THE PRESIDENCY AND NOT JUST\nMICHELLE OBAMA BUT ELIZABETH WARREN, YOU SAW OPRAH WINFREY UP\nTHERE. J. LO WILL BE PERFORMING.\nCAN YOU GET NOT JUST MILLENIAL ENTHUSIASM BUT MILLENIAL FEMALE\nENTHUSIASM AND CAN THAT SWEEP HILLARY IN AND ALSO SWEEP OUT\nTHE SENATE TOWARDS THE DEMOCRATS.\nI THINK THAT'S THE BIGGER QUESTION.\nIF IT'S JUST AS INDIVIDUAL SURROGATES, BUMP IN\nNORTH CAROLINA AND OTHERS BUT BROADER PHENOMENON THAT CAN HELP\nYOU IN NEVADA.\nEVEN NORTH CAROLINA. >> I THINK YOU'RE SEEING AN\nINCREDIBLE SURROGATE SURGE HERE AT THE END.\nALICIA KEYS DROPPED ON WHILE WE WERE HERE TONIGHT.\n>> MOVE ON -- >> I WONDER WHERE THE VIDEO CAME\nFROM. I JUST THOUGHT I DON'T KNOW,\nTHANK YOU! IT WAS AMAZING!\nANYWAY, A BIG SURROGATE SURGE GOING ON FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\n>> IN TERMS OF, I MEAN THE NUMBER OF, OBVIOUSLY ON THE\nDEMOCRATIC SIDE THERE'S A DEEP BENCH OF SURROGATES, POPULAR\nSURROGATES, GOOD SPEAKERS. LESS SO ON DONALD TRUMP'S SIDE,\nYET HE IS PULLING HUGE CROWDS AND THERE IS ENTHUSIASM CLEARLY\nVISIBLE IN HUGE RALLIES STILL. >> DONALD TRUMP A SURROGATE.\nTHE MORE POLITICIANS HELP HIM THE WORSE.\nHE'S RUNNING AGAINST WASHINGTON. TO HAVE POLITICIANS COMING IN\nTHINK HE'S GREAT IT WOULD BREAK THE MESSAGE HE'S RUN ON FOR SO\nLONG. >> DONALD TRUMP SAID MELANIA\nTRUMP WILL BE MAKING TWO TO THREE SPEECHES.\nSHE ALMOST SEEMED SURPRISED OR STEPHANOPOLOUS SEEMED TO THINK\nSHE WAS SURPRISED. IT'S NOT SOMETHING SHE'S DONE\nREALLY SINCE THE CONVENTION. SHE'S VERY ELOQUENT, VERY\nPOISED. DO YOU THINK THAT IS SOMETHING\nTHAT CAN HELP DONALD TRUMP? >> CLEARLY.\nI THINK SHE SOFTENS HIM AND SOMETHING THAT GETS GREAT MEDIA\nCOVERAGE WHERE WOMEN CAN SEE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE OF DONALD\nTRUMP, A LOVING CARING FATHERLY FIGURE AND\nMAYBE PERSONALIZE IT, THAT COULD HELP.\n>> THE TOWN HALL WE DID WITH DONALD TRUMP AND HIS FAMILY.\nTO SEE HIM ON THE STAGE WITH HIS KIDS IT IMPRESSED\nA LOT OF PEOPLE. >> EVEN WHEN HILLARY WAS ASKED\nTO SEE WHAT SHE ADMIRED MOST, IS HIS KIDS.\nYOU HAVEN'T SEEN IVAN KA AS MUCH AS YOU THOUGHT.\nRIBBON CUTTING RECENTLY. BUT WANTED TO SAY\nTONIGHT'S UNFORTUNATE EVENT SOMETIMES CAN TURN PEOPLE INTO\nSYMPATHETIC FIGURES. YOU WONDER WHETHER SOMEONE LIKE\nMIKE PENCE, SOLID BUT FRANKLY BLAND, WHETHER OR NOT THE TRUMP\nTEAM CAN TURN THIS INTO SOMETHING MORE.\nMIKE PENCE DISPATCHED TO NEBRASKA, WEIRD THEY HAVE HIM IN\nNEBRASKA WHETHER OR NOT YOU COULD USE HIM IN DIFFERENT WAYS\nCOULD BE AN INTERESTING OPPORTUNITY TO USE SOMEONE LIKE\nMIKE PENCE DIFFERENTLY. >> I'D LIKE TO THANK EVERYBODY\nON THE PANEL. JUST AHEAD, MORE ON THE NEW\nBATCH OF LEAKED CLINTON E-MAILS. THE PICTURE THEY PAINT OF THE\nMOMENT WHEN NEWS OF CLINTON'S PRIVATE EMAIL SERVER HIT IT'S\nFASCINATING.",

THAT IS TELLING FORMER CLINTON.\nTHE MEMO REVEALING A PLAN, QUOTE, YIELDED 20 MILLION TO HIM\nPERSONALLY WITH $66 MILLION OVER NINE YEARS.\nMEANING IT COULD CONTINUE FROM 2011 TO 2020 OR THE END OF HIS\nWIFE'S FIRST TERM. THAT IS JUST PUBLIC PRESSURE.\nCHELSEA CLINTON BLUE THE WHISTLE THAT HIS FOUNDATION WAS MAKING\nMONEY OFF OF HER FATHER'S FOUNDATION AND FORMER ALLEGES\nTHE FORMER PRESIDENT WAS COLLECTING MONEY FROM SPONSORS\nOF CGI.

CLINTON IS THAT THESE DISCLOSURES REMIND\nVOTERS OF 30 YEARS OF CLINTIN ONAND THE EXHAUSTION MANY FEEL\nWHEN EXPERIENCING THE CLINTONS FROM ANY LENGTH OF TIME AND\nLEARNING THAT HILLARY CLINTON 11 RENTALINGED HER PUBLIC OFFICE TO\nINCREASE THEIR FOUNTATION, THE FIRST CLINTON PRESIDENCY AND A\nGLIMPSE OF THE FUTURE IN TERMS OF WHAT A HILLARY CLINTON\nPRESIDENCY WOULD BE. IT'S NOT A GOOD LOOK FOR HER.\n>> IT MAKES IT SOUND LIKE THAT BILL CLINTON WAS GETTING RICH AS\nHE SOLICITED DONATIONS FOR HIS CHARITY LIKE A LITTLE FOR\nCHARITY, WHAT ABOUT BILL? HERE I AM.\nRIGHT? AND SHE'S NOT EVEN PROMISING TO\nSHUT THIS THING DOWN. >> WE CAN'T LET THIS\nCONVERSATION GET TOO FAR DOWN THE TRACKS TO SAY RUSSIA.\n>> RUSSIA. IT'S BAD, IT'S BAD.\nTHEY SHOULDN'T BE MESSING WITH OUR ELECTION.\n>> AND AGAIN, PUTIN WANTS DONALD TRUMP TO BE PRESIDENT.\nTHAT IS WHY THIS IS PUBLIC TO BEGIN WITH.\n>> IT'S TRUE AND VALID. NOW, LET'S TALK ABOUT IT.\n>> YES. >> SECOND POINT.\nAT THIS POINT, VOTERS ARE VOTING.\nTHE REST OF THE VOTERS IN FINAL DAYS ARE TRYING TO DECIDE THE\nBEST PERSON TO BE COMMANDER IN CHIEF.\nIF YOU LOOK AT THIS NEWS, IT REENFORCES WHAT YOU THOUGHT\nABOUT THE CLINTONS. IF YOU'RE A CLINTON SUPPORTER\nYOU THINK OKAY. WHATEVER.\nENOUGH WITH THE WIKILEAKS. FOLKS IN THE MIDDLE TRYING TO\nDECIDE WHO IS GOING TO BE THE BEST COMMANDER IN CHIEF.\nTHIS IS NOT GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT WHATSOEVER ON WHETHER OR\nNOT PEOPLE THINK HILLARY CLINTON SHOULD, OR SHOULD NOT BE THE\nCOMMANDER IN CHIEF. DONALD TRUMP IS RUNNING OUT OF\nPATHS TO 270 ELECTORAL VOTES. THIS DOES NOT CREATE A NEW ONE\nFOR THEM. >> LET'S TAKE IT UP ON THE\nPOLLING. THE TRUMP CAMP BELIEVES THEY\nHAVE MOMENTUM. FOX NEWS POLL SHES HER LEADING\nBY THREE AND LEAD SHRINKING. AND SHOWS HIS STANDING WITH\nINDEPENDENTS GETTING BETTER AND HIS STANDING WITH REPUBLICANS\nGETTING BETTER AS WELL. >> WHERE I DISAGREE IS THAT THIS\nIS VOTERS ARE TRYING TO DECIDE, RIGHT?\nWHOEVER IS UNDER SPOTLIGHT SUFFERS.\nAND THE OTHER THING IS THAT ONE OF THE THINGS HILLARY CLINTON\nHAS GOING FOR HER IS THAT SHE HAS THIS KIND OF NEWS MAY DAMPEN\nENTHUSIASM. >> WILL THIS HELP?\n>> YES. I MEAN MRS. CLINTON HAD A\nDIFFICULT TIME AND THIS HAS NOT HELPED.\nTHERE ARE ABOUT 10% TO 20% UNDECIDED.\nDONALD TRUMP NEEDS THAT GROUP OF UNDECIDED.",

IF WEEK'S MEMO SUGGESTS THE\nDOORS ARE WIDE OPEN FOR MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF CONSULTING FEES TO\nCONTINUE TO FLOW TO MR. CLINTON, DETAILING WHAT YOU CALL BILL\nCLINTON INC. THAT IS TELLING FORMER CLINTON.\nTHE MEMO REVEALING A PLAN, QUOTE, YIELDED 20 MILLION TO HIM\nPERSONALLY WITH $66 MILLION OVER NINE YEARS.\nMEANING IT COULD CONTINUE FROM 2011 TO 2020 OR THE END OF HIS\nWIFE'S FIRST TERM. THAT IS JUST PUBLIC PRESSURE.\nCHELSEA CLINTON BLUE THE WHISTLE THAT HIS FOUNDATION WAS MAKING\nMONEY OFF OF HER FATHER'S FOUNDATION AND FORMER ALLEGES\nTHE FORMER PRESIDENT WAS COLLECTING MONEY FROM SPONSORS\nOF CGI.

CLINTON IS THAT THESE DISCLOSURES REMIND\nVOTERS OF 30 YEARS OF CLINTIN ONAND THE EXHAUSTION MANY FEEL\nWHEN EXPERIENCING THE CLINTONS FROM ANY LENGTH OF TIME AND\nLEARNING THAT HILLARY CLINTON 11 RENTALINGED HER PUBLIC OFFICE TO\nINCREASE THEIR FOUNTATION, THE FIRST CLINTON PRESIDENCY AND A\nGLIMPSE OF THE FUTURE IN TERMS OF WHAT A HILLARY CLINTON\nPRESIDENCY WOULD BE. IT'S NOT A GOOD LOOK FOR HER.\n>> IT MAKES IT SOUND LIKE THAT BILL CLINTON WAS GETTING RICH AS\nHE SOLICITED DONATIONS FOR HIS CHARITY LIKE A LITTLE FOR\nCHARITY, WHAT ABOUT BILL? HERE I AM.\nRIGHT? AND SHE'S NOT EVEN PROMISING TO\nSHUT THIS THING DOWN. >> WE CAN'T LET THIS\nCONVERSATION GET TOO FAR DOWN THE TRACKS TO SAY RUSSIA.\n>> RUSSIA. IT'S BAD, IT'S BAD.\nTHEY SHOULDN'T BE MESSING WITH OUR ELECTION.\n>> AND AGAIN, PUTIN WANTS DONALD TRUMP TO BE PRESIDENT.\nTHAT IS WHY THIS IS PUBLIC TO BEGIN WITH.\n>> IT'S TRUE AND VALID. NOW, LET'S TALK ABOUT IT.\n>> YES. >> SECOND POINT.\nAT THIS POINT, VOTERS ARE VOTING.\nTHE REST OF THE VOTERS IN FINAL DAYS ARE TRYING TO DECIDE THE\nBEST PERSON TO BE COMMANDER IN CHIEF.\nIF YOU LOOK AT THIS NEWS, IT REENFORCES WHAT YOU THOUGHT\nABOUT THE CLINTONS. IF YOU'RE A CLINTON SUPPORTER\nYOU THINK OKAY. WHATEVER.\nENOUGH WITH THE WIKILEAKS. FOLKS IN THE MIDDLE TRYING TO\nDECIDE WHO IS GOING TO BE THE BEST COMMANDER IN CHIEF.\nTHIS IS NOT GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT WHATSOEVER ON WHETHER OR\nNOT PEOPLE THINK HILLARY CLINTON SHOULD, OR SHOULD NOT BE THE\nCOMMANDER IN CHIEF. DONALD TRUMP IS RUNNING OUT OF\nPATHS TO 270 ELECTORAL VOTES. THIS DOES NOT CREATE A NEW ONE\nFOR THEM. >> LET'S TAKE IT UP ON THE\nPOLLING. THE TRUMP CAMP BELIEVES THEY\nHAVE MOMENTUM. FOX NEWS POLL SHES HER LEADING\nBY THREE AND LEAD SHRINKING. AND SHOWS HIS STANDING WITH\nINDEPENDENTS GETTING BETTER AND HIS STANDING WITH REPUBLICANS\nGETTING BETTER AS WELL. >> WHERE I DISAGREE IS THAT THIS\nIS VOTERS ARE TRYING TO DECIDE, RIGHT?\nWHOEVER IS UNDER SPOTLIGHT SUFFERS.\nAND THE OTHER THING IS THAT ONE OF THE THINGS HILLARY CLINTON\nHAS GOING FOR HER IS THAT SHE HAS THIS KIND OF NEWS MAY DAMPEN\nENTHUSIASM. >> WILL THIS HELP?\n>> YES. I MEAN MRS. CLINTON HAD A\nDIFFICULT TIME AND THIS HAS NOT HELPED.\nTHERE ARE ABOUT 10% TO 20% UNDECIDED.\nDONALD TRUMP NEEDS THAT GROUP OF UNDECIDED.",

I MEAN!\nEVERYBODY SAW HER ON TELEVISION. IT'S LIKE THE OLD GROUCHO\nMARCUS. BELIEVE ME OR YOUR LYING EYES.\nWE ALL SAW HER DO VERY WELL IN THE STAMINA DEPARTMENT IN ALL\nTHREE DEBATES. IT'S NOT QUESTIONABLE THAT SHE\nWAS WEAK. >> I THINK THE REALITY FOR TRUMP\nIS THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS VERY EFFECTIVELY BATTED BACK ALL OF\nTHAT. AND PUSHED BACK ON IT VERY, VERY\nCLEARLY AND EFFECTIVELY. AND DONE SO IN A WAY IN WHICH\nSHE SHOWED, ACTUALLY, IN MY VIEW, HIM TO BE THE WEAKER OF\nTHE TWO OF THEM.

      "text": "MARCO RUBIO SENATE RACE IN\nFLORIDA, EVEN THOUGH THAT COULD BE A WINNABLE RACE FOR THE\nDEMOCRATS. WELL, TONIGHT WE'VE GOT NEW\nLATE-BREAKING NEWS THAT THE DEMOCRATS MIGHT BE RECONSIDERING\nTHAT DECISION. THE DEMOCRATS MAY BE JUMPING\nBACK INTO THAT FLORIDA SENATE RACE AGAINST MARCO RUBIO AS OF\nTONIGHT. IT'S VERY LAST MINUTE.\nIT APPEARS TO BE THEM JUMPING BACK IN IN A VERY BIG WAY.\nIT'S INTERESTING, WE'VE GOT DETAILS ON THAT AHEAD.\nWE'VE ALSO GOT TREMENDOUSLY GOOD NAMES TONIGHT CONCERNING THE\nOBAMA FAMILY. IT'S NEWS THAT IS SLIGHTLY MORE\nPERSONAL THAN IT IS POLITICAL, BUT THAT'S AHEAD TONIGHT AS\nWELL. SO THERE'S LOTS -- LOTS COMING\nUP, INCLUDING FOR ONCE SOME NEWS THAT IS MORE GOOD THAN BAD,\nWHICH IS ALWAYS NICE. BUT WE'RE GOING TO START TONIGHT\nWITH SOME NEW TAPE THAT HAS NEVER BEEN HEARD PUBLICLY\nBEFORE. IT'S NEVER BEEN BROADCAST\nBEFORE. WE'RE GOING TO BREAK THIS HERE\nLIVE TONIGHT WITH YOU. AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU, YOU'LL\nBE SURPRISED TO HEAR THIS, BUT THIS NEW TAPE THAT HAS NEVER\nBEEN BROADCAST BEFORE, IT IS TAPE FROM THE GREATEST BASEBALL\nPLAYER IN NEW YORK. >> I WAS THE BEST BASEBALL\nPLAYER IN NEW YORK WHEN I WAS YOUNG.\n>> DO YOU RECOGNIZE THAT VOICE? THAT'S A REMARKABLE THING TO\nHAVE LEARNED TODAY FROM THIS BRAND NEW TAPE THAT'S NEVER BEEN\nBROADCAST BEFORE. IT'S DONALD TRUMP SPEAKING.\nHE SAYS WHEN I WAS YOUNG, SO WE'RE THINKING WE'RE TALKING\nABOUT MAYBE HE WAS 17 OR 16 YEARS OLD, WHEN HE WAS 16 YEARS\nOLD, THAT WAS 1962. THAT'S WHEN THE YANKEES WENT TO\nTHE WORLD SERIES, THEY WON THE WORLD SERIES.\nIT WAS LIKE MICKEY MANTLE, ROGER MARIS.\nEVEN IF YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT BASEBALL, YOU KNOW MICKEY\nMANTLE. BUT IT TURNS OUT NONE OF THEM\nWERE THE BEST BASEBALL PLAYER IN NEW YORK THAT YEAR.\nNO, IT WAS THIS OTHER GUY. >> I WAS THE BEST BASEBALL\nPLAYER IN NEW YORK WHEN I WAS YOUNG.\n>> THIS IS THE BEST TAPE WE'VE GOTTEN OUR HANDS ON IN A VERY\nLONG TIME. THIS IS INCREDIBLE.\nALL RIGHT. THIS IS FROM 2014.\nTHERE IS A PULITZER PRIZE-WINNING REPORTER NAMED\nMICHAEL DANTONIO. IN PREPARING THE BOOK HE DID\nHOURS AND HOURS OF INTERVIEWS WITH DONALD TRUMP, JUST RAW\nFOOTAGE OF THEM TALKING. SOME OF THOSE TAPES HAVE BEEN\nOBTAINED BY \"THE NEW YORK TIMES.\"\nTHE \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" HAS BEEN DOING A LITTLE BIT OF\nREPORTING ON THEM RECENTLY BUT THEY HAVE NOT PUBLISHED THIS\nAUDIO WE ARE ABOUT TO PLAY. I DON'T TOTALLY WANT TO SPOIL IT\nHERE, BUT ARM CHAIR PSYCHOLOGISTS, START YOUR\nENGINES. THIS IS INCREDIBLE.\n>> I WENT TO MILITARY ACADEMY, NEW YORK MILITARY ACADEMY FOR\nFIVE YEARS, FROM THE YEAR BEFORE FRESHMAN.\n>> SO EIGHTH GRADE ON? >> YES.\n>> WHOSE IDEA WAS THIS? >> WELL, I WAS VERY REBELLIOUS\nAND MY PARENTS THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA.\nI WAS VERY REBELLIOUS. I LOVED TO FIGHT.\nI ALWAYS LOVE TO FIGHT. >> PHYSICAL FIGHTS.\n>> ALL KINDS OF FIGHTS. PHYSICAL.\n>> ARGUMENTS? >> ALL TYPES OF FIGHTS.\nANY KIND OF FIGHT I LOVED IT, INCLUDING PHYSICAL.\nAND I WAS ALWAYS THE BEST ATHLETE, SOMETHING THAT NOBODY\nKNEW ABOUT ME. BUT ONE GUY YOU SHOULD SPEAK TO\nBEFORE IT'S TOO LATE, BECAUSE HE'S A PRETTY OLD GUY NOW, IS\nMAJOR DOBIAS. SO WHEN DOBIAS WAS A DRILL\nSERGEANT IN THE ARMY, AND THESE GUYS WERE ROUGH.\nTHIS GUY WAS SO ROUGH. IN THOSE DAYS, THEY'D SMACK THE\nHELL OUT OF YOU. IT'S NOT LIKE TODAY WHERE YOU\nSMACK SOMEBODY AND YOU END UP GOING TO JAIL FOR THE REST OF\nYOUR LIFE. SO I WENT UP THERE, I'LL NEVER\nFORGET. >> EIGHTH GRADE?\n>> AND I'M STANDING THERE AT MILITARY ACADEMY.\nTHIS GUY COMES UP AND HE'S LIKE A BULLDOG TOO, ROUGH GUY.\nHE WAS A DRILL SERGEANT. NOW THEY CALL HIM MAJOR DOBIAS.\nBUT WHEN I FIRST KNEW HIM HE WAS SERGEANT DOBISA RIGHT RIGHT\nARMY. HE WAS PHYSICALLY ROUGH AND\nMENTALLY ROUGH. HE WAS ALSO MY BASEBALL COACH.\nAND HE SAID THINGS LIKE STAND UP, AND I WENT GIVE ME A\n[ BLEEP ] BREAK. AND THIS GUY CAME AT ME.\nYOU WOULD NEVER BELIEVE IT. IT WAS REALLY FANTASTIC.\n>> DID HE ROUGH YOU UP? >> OH, YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.\n>> GRABBED YOU BY THE SHIRT? >> WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER, BUT\nIT WAS NOT LIKE WHAT HAPPENS TODAY.\nAND YOU HAD TO LEARN TO SURVIVE. IT WAS TOUGH.\nIT WASN'T TODAY. THOSE WERE ROUGHER TIMES.\nTHAT WAS BEFORE VIETNAM AND THESE WERE GUYS THAT DIDN'T TAKE\n[ BLEEP ]. YOU MUST CALL HIM, BEFORE IT'S\nTOO LATE. ASK HIM ABOUT HOW WAS TRUMP AS\nAN ATHLETE? BECAUSE HE SAID -- HE COACHED\nFOR MANY, MANY -- IT WAS LIKE 35 YEARS.\nHE SAID DONALD TRUMP WAS THE BEST ATHLETE I'VE EVER COACHED.\nDONALD TRUMP WAS THE BEST BASEBALL PLAYER I'VE EVER\nCOACHED. YOU KNOW, JUST SOMETHING TO --\n>> WHEN DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE GOOD?\n>> I ALWAYS KNEW I WAS GOOD. I WAS ALWAYS A GOOD ATHLETE.\nI WAS ALWAYS THE BEST ATHLETE. >> LIKE IN FIRST GRADE IF THE\nKIDS THE A GAME -- >> FROM BEFORE THE FIRST GRADE.\nI WAS THE BEST BASEBALL PLAYER IN NEW YORK WHEN I WAS YOUNG.\nNOW, IN THOSE DAYS, YOU KNOW, YOU COULDN'T PLAY BASEBALL\nBECAUSE THERE WAS NO REAL -- YOU KNOW, IT WASN'T A THING.\nPLUS MY FATHER WAS IN THE REAL ESTATE BUSINESS, WHICH I DIDN'T\nWANT TO GO INTO. I WANTED TO GO INTO THEATER.\nI WANTED TO GO INTO SPORTS. BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT WAS VERY\nLIMITED BECAUSE IN THOSE DAYS YOU COULDN'T EVEN MAKE ANY MONEY\nBEING A GREAT BASEBALL PLAYER. >> DIDN'T THE DODGERS TRAIN AT\nWEST POINT A COUPLE TIMES, IN THE SPRING?\n>> EVERYBODY WANTED ME TO BE A BASEBALL PLAYER.\n>> RIGHT. >> BUT I WAS A GOOD AT OTHER\nTHINGS TOO. I WAS GOOD AT WRESTLING.\nI WAS REALLY GOOD AT FOOTBALL. I WAS A GOOD -- I WAS ALWAYS\nGOOD AT SPORTS. I WAS ALWAYS LIKE THE BEST AT\nSPORTS. >> ALWAYS THE BEST.\nAT ALL SPORTS. MY FAVORITE PART OF THAT, I LOVE\nTHE EXPLANATION FOR WHY, YOU KNOW, NOBODY KNOWS EVEN NOW THAT\nHE WAS THE GREATEST BASEBALL PLAYER IN NEW YORK.\nHE SAYS WHEN I WAS YOUNG, I WAS THE BEST BASEBALL PLAYER IN NEW\nYORK WHEN I WAS YOUNG. NOW HE SAYS BUT, YOU KNOW, IN\nTHOSE DAYS, BASEBALL WASN'T REALLY A THING.\nI WAS THE BEST BASEBALL PLAYER IN NEW YORK WHEN I WAS YOUNG.\nNOW IN THOSE DAYS YOU COULDN'T PLAY BASEBALL BECAUSE THERE WAS\nNO REAL, YOU KNOW, IT WASN'T A THING.\nHE SAYS IN THOSE DAYS YOU COULDN'T EVEN MAKE ANY MONEY\nBEING A BASEBALL PLAYER. AGAIN, THE TIME HE'S TALKING\nABOUT HERE IS WHEN HE WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL, LIKE 1962, 1963.\nYANKEES GOING TO THE WORLD SERIES.\nSOME OF THE BEST REMEMBERED GAMES OF ALL TIME.\nBASEBALL, UNEQUIVOCALLY THE NATIONAL PASTIME.\nMICKEY MANTLE A NATIONAL HERO. BUT DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T WANT TO\nBOTHER SHOWING UP ALL OF THOSE LESSER BASEBALL PLAYERS BECAUSE\nBASEBALL WASN'T REALLY A THING THEN.\nWE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE LEATHER COVERED BALLS, WE JUST HAD ROCKS\nTHAT WE HID INTO THE CAVE ART. BASEBALL WASN'T A THING THEN?\nTHAT'S WHY YOU WEREN'T? EVERYBODY WANTED HIM TO PLAY BUT\nTHERE WASN'T REALLY A BASEBALL ORGANIZATION.\nDONALD TRUMP BELIEVES, NOT HYPERBOLICALLY, NOT JOKINGLY,\nBUT APPARENTLY IN ALL SERIOUSNESS THAT HE WAS THE\nGREATEST BASEBALL PLAYER IN NEW YORK WHEN HE WAS A YOUNG MAN.\nHE WAS THE BEST AT THAT. HE WAS THE BEST AT ALL OF\nSPORTS. AND WHY, MR. TRUMP, WERE YOU THE\nBEST? >> I THINK YOU HAVE A NATURAL\nABILITY AT THINGS.",

THERE IS CERTAINLY A LONG HI\nHISTORICAL PRECEDENT FOR A SUPREME COURT WITH FEWER JU\nJUSTICES. CAN THEY DO THAT?\n>> THERE ARE TWO IMPLICATIONS. NOBODY IS GOING TO RETIRE FROM\nTHE SUPREME COURT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE 90-YEAR-OLD\nSUPREME COURT JUSTICES. NOBODY IS GOING TO LEAVE IF THEY\nKNOW THEIR VACACY IS NOT GOING TO BE FILLED.\nHILLARY CLINTON WILL APPOINT THE FIRST ASIAN AMERICAN AND THE\nREPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO BE THE ONES NOT ALLOWING AN ASIAN\nAMERICAN, WHEN A LARGE NUMBER OF AMERICANS ARE VOTING FOR THE\nASIAN-AMERICANS. AND THE REPUBLICANS WILL LOSE IF\nSHE DOES THIS. >> SO DOUGLAS, CRUZ ISN'T THE\nONLY THREATENING A SCOTUS BLOCKADE.\nHERE'S CLINTON LAST WEEK. >> I PROMISE YOU THAT WE WILL BE\nUNITED AGAINST ANY SUPREME COURT NOMINEE THAT HILLARY CLINTON, IF\nSHE WERE PRESIDENT WOULD PUT UP. I PROMISE YOU.\n>> HE LATER WALKED THAT BACK. IS THERE ANY HISTORICAL\nPRECEDENT FOR THIS? >> NO, THIS WOULD BE A -- AGAIN,\nANOTHER -- WE'RE LOOKING AT A SHUTDOWN OF THE SUPREME COURT IN\nESSENCE. TO NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE NINE\nSUPREME COURT JUSTICES TO OPERATE WITH EIGHT, AND THOSE\nARE WAR WORDS. BASICALLY THAT'S THE SAME AS\nDONALD TRUMP CALLING THE ELECTION RIGGED.\nREPUBLICANS ARE SAYING WE DON'T WANT A FULL SUPREME COURT.\nWELL STOP IT. WE DON'T CARE WHO IT IS.\nI'M GLAD JOHN MCCAIN WALKED THAT BACK.\nHE SHOULD HAVE. BUT SOME OF THESE THREATS ARE\nDESIGNED TO MAKE SURE IF HILLARY CLINTON WINS SHE DOESN'T GO WITH\nSOMEBODY TOO PROGRESSIONVE, HER CHOICE IS SOMEBODY IN A KIND OF\nCENTRIST, IN THE KIND OF CENTER MOLD.\nI DON'T WANT TO SAY THEY'RE GETTING VEILED THREATS, BUT\nTHEY'RE LETTING HER KNOW DON'T GET HARD LEFT, WE DON'T WANT A\nWILLIAM DOUGLAS ON OUR HANDS. >> DOESN'T SOUND THAT MERRICK,\nMICHAEL? >> I THOUGHT THIS WAS THE FIRST\nQUESTION, DOES SHE RECOMMIT MERRICK GARLAND, A ASSUMING HE\nDOESN'T GET CONFIRMED AFTER THE ELECTION AND THAT'S A SOMEWHAT\nTOUGH CHOICE BECAUSE HE WAS SELECTED BECAUSE HE IS SEEN AS A\nCENTRIST, DEMOCRAT MODERATE, REPUBLICANS LIKE OREN HATCH HAD\nSUPPORTED IN THE PAST, BUT TO THE PROGRESSIVE BASE OF THE\nPARTY, HE'S NOT THE KIND OF SUPREME COURT JUSTICE THEY ARE\nGOING TO BE LOOKING FOR. I THINK THERE COULD BE SOME REAL\nISSUES ON THAT. >> AND REMEMBER THE CONSTITUTION\nSAYS, WITH THE ADVICE AND CONSENT OF THE SENATE.\nIF I'M A REPUBLICAN SENATOR I GIVE MY ADVICE TO PRESIDENT\nOBAMA AND HILLARY CLINTON AND SAY RENOMINATE MERRICK GARLAND,\nWE'LL CONFIRM HIM, BUT DON'T NOMINATE ANYBODY TO THE LEFT OF\nHIM AND IT WILL SEND A VERY POWERFUL MESSAGE AS LONG AS THE\nDEMOCRATS DON'T TRY TO USE THE ELECTION TO DETERMINE THE\nSUPREME COURT FOR YEARS TO COME AS A LEFTIST CONSTITUTION.\n>> SO IF THEY KNOW JUSTICES -- WHO WAS THAT?\n>> IT WAS DOUG. I WAS GOING TO SAY HILLARY\nCLINTON'S DOING EVERYTHING IN MIND TO HAVE A DEMOCRATIC SENATE\nAND THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS, THAT DEMOCRATS TAKE OVER THE\nSENATE, SOMEBODY LIKE GARLAND WILL BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH THIS\nPROCESS QUITE EASILY, BUT I THINK ALLEN NAILED IT, SHE'S\nGOING TO HAVE A CHOICE OF DOUBLING DOWN ON GARLAND OR\nPERHAPS AN ASIAN-AMERICAN AND STICKING IT TO THE REPUBLICANS\nIN ANOTHER FASHION. I BELIEVE WE'LL HAVE OUR NINTH\nSUPREME COURT JUSTICE IN 2017. >> DOUGLAS, I WANTED TO AND IS\nTHERE AN INCENTIVE IF YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE A JUSTICE AND YOU KNOW\nYOU'RE SEAT IS NOT GOING TO BE FILLED DOES IT LEAD YOU IN A WAY\nTO RETIRE OR NOT TO RETIRE? >> OF COURSE THERE'S POLITICS IN\nTHINGS BUT IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO -- YOU KNOW, HEALTH IS WHAT\nUSUALLY GETS PEOPLE, BUT HILLARY CLINTON HAS ONE POST TO FILL AND\nSHE'S PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER VACANCY ON HER HAND SO\nIT WILL BE A OBAMA/HILLARY CLINTON SUPREME COURT AND THAT'S\nBEEN THE KEY POINT DONALD TRUMP'S BEEN TRYING TO BRING THE\nRIGHT BACK HOME, THE TED CRUZ REPUBLICANS SAYING HILLARY\nCLINTON WINS, WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE TWO MORE SUPREME\nCOURT JUSTICES THAT DON'T THINK AS CONSTITUTIONALISTS LIKE WE\nDO. >> THE LAST SUPREME COURT\nRETIRED FOR HEALTH REASONS. O'CONNOR HAD THE OPTION NOT TO,\nSUITOR, AND STEVENS, WHO WAS QUITE OLD BUT HEALTHY.\nI DO THINK IT WILL HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON KEEPING JUSTICES ON\nTHE SUPREME COURT BECAUSE THEY CARE ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION.\nT  THEY DON'T WANT THE INSTITUTION\nTO BE DAMAGED. >> IT COULD GO INTO THE 90s.\n>> THE CITY IS BROKEN IN SOME WAYS AND WE'RE DESTROYING OUR\nINSTITUTIONS. DO YOU AGREE?\n>> YEAH, I THINK MOST OF THE COUNTRY AGREES WITH THAT -- FOR\nDIFFERENT REASONS, BUT YOU KNOW, THE DYSFUNCTIONAL NATURE OF\nWASHINGTON, THE INABILITY OF CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT TO\nWORK TOGETHER ON ANYTHING, YOU KNOW, IS -- HAS BEEN -- YOU\nKNOW, IT'S CERTAINLY BEEN A MAJOR FACTOR FOR -- IN DONALD\nTRUMP'S RISE, BUT THE PERCEPTION THAT WE NEED TO THROW THE -- YOU\nKNOW, THE -- ALL THE RASCAL OUT, THAT'S WHY HE GOT AS FAR AS HE\nDID AND WERE IT NOT FOR HIS MANIFEST FLAWS ON SO MANY OTHER\nFRONTS HE'D PROBABLY BE DOING A LOT BETTER AGAINST HILLARY\nCLINTON WHO, FOR BETTER OR WORSE, IS SEEN AS SOMEBODY WHOSE\nBEEN AROUND FOR MANY YEARS AND IS AN ESTABLISHMENT FIGURE WHO'S\nPART OF THE SYSTEM IN WASHINGTON.\n>> DOUGLAS, IF THE COUNTRY AGREES WITH THAT, THEN WHY DON'T\nTHEY ELECT PEOPLE WHO CAN WORK TOGETHER?\n>> WELL, LOOK, FIRST OFF, ON THAT WHOLE BROKEN ARGUMENT,\nBARACK OBAMA HAS A 55% A PPPROV RATING.\nTHAT'S NOT BROKEN. THAT'S THE NUMBERS OF RONALD\nREAGAN, AND BILL CLINTON OUT OF Z\nZENITH MEANING PEOPLE ARE BELIEVING THE OBAMA\nADMINISTRATION, THEY'RE DOING WELL.\nHILLARY CLINTON MIGHT WIN AN ABSOLUTE HISTORIC ELECTION.\nI THINK WHAT'S BROKEN IS CONGRESS.\nCONGRESS HAS ABOUT A 15% OR LOWER APPROVAL RATING AND THAT\nIS A PROBLEM. I DON'T THINK THE SUPREME COURT\nIS JUST AS BROKEN IF WE GET A NINTH IN.\nOUR ARMED FORCES AREN'T BROKEN AND I DON'T THINK THE EXECUTIVE\nBRANCH IS BROKEN. I THINK IT'S THE LEGISLATIVE\nBRANCH THAT'S A MESS. >> I DO THINK PEOPLE DON'T VOTE\nTO MAKE SURE PEOPLE CAN WORK TOGETHER.\nTHEY VOTE FOR PRESIDENT WHO THEY LIKE, A SENATOR WHO THEY LIKE.\nTHE EFFECT IS, EITHER TO HAVE GRIDLOCK OR TO HAVE WORKING\nTOGETHER, BUT VERY FEW PEOPLE CAST A VOTE IN ORDER TO DECREASE\nGRIDLOCK OR INCREASE WORKING TOGETHER.\nI THINK THAT'S WHY WE GET GRIDLOCKED BECAUSE IT'S AN\nUNINTENDED CONVENIENCE OF VOTING FOR INDIVIDUALS.\n>> SO THE VOTE IS EMOTIONAL, RATHER THAN --\n>> NO, IT -- >>E\n>> SER REB RAL. >> I'LL VOTE FOR THE PRESIDENT\nAND I'LL VOTE FOR THE SENATOR OF A DIFFERENT PARTY BECAUSE I WANT\nTO MAKE SURE THERE'S GRIDLOCK. I THINK THERE'S VERY LITTLE OF\nTHAT. THERE'S AN ATTEMPT TO DO THAT BY\nSOME REPUBLICANS SAYING PLEASE VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS IN THE\nSENATE BECAUSE WE THINK HILLARY CLINTON WILL WIN AND WE DON'T\nWANT TO GIVE HERR, HER WAY WITHOUT CHECKS AND BALANCES.\n>> THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN.",

CLINTON. NOT ONLY DID HE BRING IN\nMILLIONS TO THE FOUNDATION, I SET UP MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN\nSPEAKING FEES FOR BILL CLINTON, AND A HEFTY INCOME FOR HIMSELF.\nCONSULTING WITH FOLKS WHO DONATED MONEY TO THE FOUNDATION.\nIT'S A TANGLED WEB, IF YOU GET THE PICTURE.\nMONEY WENT TO CHARITY, MONEY WENT TO BILL CLINTON.\nMONEY WENT TO THE BAND. AND STUDYING TAX RETURNS FROM\nTHE CLINTON FOUNDATION, ACCORDING TO THIS DOCUMENT,\nMILLIONS WERE SPENT ON NONCHARITABLE EXPENSES.\nIN 2014, THE CLINTON FOUNDATION RECEIVED $338 MILLION IN\nREVENUE. WOW.\n64% OF THAT MONEY WENT FOR CHARIT\nTHE REST WAS SAVED, SPENDS ON ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, OR\nINVESTED. INCLUDING IN THE EXPENSES ARE\nLAVISH SALARIES FOR CLINTON PALS.\nTHEN CEO ERIC BRAVER RECEIVED $532,000 IN TOTAL COMPENSATION.\nNOT BAD. BRUCE LINDSAY, ALMOST $400,000.\nMARK GUNTON, $313,000. AND IN ADDITION, BILL, HILLARY\nAND CHELSEA CLINTON USED PRIVATE JETS TO FLY AROUND ON FOUNDATION\nBUSINESS. THAT IS LEGAL, BUT RARE.\nCHARITIES USUALLY ARE SCHEDULED AIRLINES TO SAVE MONEY.\nTO BE FAIR, MR. AND MRS. CLINTON ARE VERY HIGH PROFILE PEOPLE,\nSECRET SERVICE AGENTS ARE NEEDED BUT THERE IS NO QUESTION THE\nPRIVATE AIR TRAVEL AFFORDED THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO WHATEVER\nTHEY WANTED TO DO, AND GO WHENEVER THEY WANTED TO GO.\nTHAT IS A HUGE ADVANTAGE FOR A POLITICIAN.\nIS IT NOT? TALKING POINTS BELIEVE THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION IS A JOINT VENTURE, BUSINESS, POLITICAL,\nAND CHARITABLE. THE CLINTONS FIGURED OUT HOW TO\nACCOMPLISH ALL THREE THINGS UNDER THE FOUNDATION BANNER.\nIT IS LEFT TO YOU, THE VOTER TO DECIDE WHETHER THAT IS ETHICAL.\nONE FOOTNOTE, I RUN MY OWN CHARITABLE FOUNDATION, I NAMED\nIT AFTER MY PARENTS AND I TAKE NOTHING.\nNO SALARY, NO TRAVEL, NO EXPENSES.\nTHAT IS THE MEMO. NOW, FOR REACTION, JOINING US\nFROM TALLAHASSEE, DID I MAKE MISTAKES IN THE MEMO OR LEAVE\nANYTHING OUT? >> NO.\nTHAT IS A GREAT SUMMARY OF CLINTON BLUR, AS I CALL IT,\nBETWEEN PHILANTHROPIC, PROFIT MAKING VENTURES AND POLITICAL\nVENTURES. I WOULD ADD THE CRITICAL\nINGREDIENT IS THE FACT THEY HAD POLITICAL POWER AT THIS TIME.\nTHIS WAS A REVIEW DONE BY SIMPSON AT THE REQUEST OF\nCHELSEA CLINTON OF THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nONE OF THE THINGS IT FOUND IS THAT DONORS HAD QUOTED\nEXPECTATION OF A QUID PRO QUO FOR GIFTS, END QUOTE.\nI THINK IT'S RELATED TO INFLUENCE PEDDLING AND THE FACT\nTHAT THESE DONORS WERE EXPECTING FAVORABLE ACTION FROM HILLARY\nCLINTON. >> I HAVE STUDIED THIS AND SO\nHAS MY STAFF, AND THEY'RE THE BEST IN THE BUSINESS.\nWE CAN'T FIND MANY QUOTES, PARTICULARLY FROM THE YEAR 2014,\n15, YOU KNOW? THE RECENT.\nYOU CAN GO BACK WITH IRANIAN STUFF.\nTHERE IS COLUMBIA, SOUTH AMERICA HERE.\nBUT IT LOOKS TO ME THAT THEY STOPPED THE QUOS.\n>> I THINK THEY HAVE SUSPENDED THEM.\n>> FOX SUSPENDED. WE DON'T SEE A LOT OF QUO COMING\nBACK. IT'S INTERESTING.\nWHY? WHY WOULD PEOPLE GIVING MONEY TO\nTHE CLINTON FOUNDATION, WHY TURN AROUND AND GIVE PRESIDENT\nCLINTON $250,000 TO SPEAK? WHAT IS IN IT FOR THEM?\nWHY DO THEY HAVE TO GIVE HIM $250,000?\n>> YOU'RE PUTTING MONEY IN MULTIPLE POCKETS.\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS NO FORMAL POWER BUT SHE'S WIDELY EXPECTED\nTO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ASSUME SHE\nMAY BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT. SO YOU CAN ARGUE IT'S A DOWN\nPAYMENT FOR SERVICES EXPECTED TO RECEIVE.\n>> NOW, ONE OF THE CRITICISMS OF YOU, AND YOUR BOOK IS WORTH\nPRINTING, YOU'RE ASSOCIATED WITH THE CEO OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.\nYOU WORK FOR GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY INSTITUTE.\nSO PEOPLE MIGHT SAY WELL, YOU KNOW, HE'S GOT A BEEF AND HOW\nWOULD YOU ANSWER THAT? >> WELL, WHAT I WOULD SAY IS\nTHAT WE STARTED RESEARCHING THE CLINTONS IN 2013.\nWE FORMED GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABLE INSTITUTE BEFORE THAT.\nWE WENT AFTER CORRECTIONAL INSIDER TRAINING, LEADERSHIP\nPACKS SO WE GO AFTER ALL FORMS OF CORRUPTION.\nI JUST ARGUE CLINTONS ARE THE ALFAS AS FAR AS SELF ENRICHMENT\nAND WE STARTED THIS BEFORE DONALD TRUMP WAS A CANDIDATE.\n>> RIGHT. RIGHT.\n>> AND YOU HAVE FRIENDS WHO, I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT.\nLAST QUESTION. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION IS CORRUPT? >> I DO.\nI DO. AND I THINK IT WARRANTS FEDERAL\nINVESTIGATION. I'M NOT A LAWYER.\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS INTERNAL REVIEW, LOOKING AT ABC NEWS\nREPORT FROM A COUPLE WEEKS AGO ABOUT HAITIAN CONTRACTS, GOING\nTO DONORS IF YOU'RE NOT A FRIEND OF BILL YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO\nCOMPETE FOR A CONTRACT. >> IF DONALD TRUMP IS ELECTED IT\nWILL GET INVESTIGATED. IF HILLARY CLINTON ELECTED.\nTHANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE APPRECIATE IT.\nPLENTY MORE IS AHEAD AS THE FACTOR MOVES ALONG THIS EVENING.\nPENTAGON SAYS SOLDIERS ORDERED TO PAY BACK BONUSES WILL NOT\nHAVE TO DO SO. THAT, AFTER THE FACTOR GOT\nINVOLVED. WE'LL HAVE THE LATEST.\nAND WATTERS ASKING THE URCHINS ABOUT THE ELECTION",

I TALKED TO A TRUMP CAMPAIGN\nOFFICIAL TODAY WHO SAID OUR PATH IS TOUGH BUT DOABLE.\n>> ROBERT COSTA, BENJAMIN CRAMER USED TO TALK ABOUT THE EMOTIONAL\nMOMENT WHERE SOMEONE WENT TO THE CANDIDATE, USUALLY ON A PLANE,\nUSUALLY EXHAUSTED, SOMETIMES A COUPLE DAYS OUT, SOMETIMES ON\nTHE EVE OF THE ELECTION, AND HAD THE TALK AND SAID, IT'S NOT\nGOING TO HAPPEN, BOSS, IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.\nDO YOU GET THE FEELING IT'S BEEN A KIND OF A SLOW MOTION CAR\nACCIDENT IN EFFECT IN THIS CAMPAIGN, IF THE FINDING OF\nJOSH'S ARTICLE, AMONG OTHER FINDINGS, IS CORRECT?\n>> IF ONLY RICHARD BEN CRAMER WAS AROUND TO WRITE ABOUT THIS\nELECTION. I THINK FOR TRUMP WHAT IT TAKES\nRIGHT NOW, BRIAN, IS A VERY NARROW PATH.\nAND JOSH'S ARTICLE IS SPOT-ON, BECAUSE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN\nBELIEVES IF THE OBAMA COALITION IS ABLE TO BE REASSEMBLED BY\nSECRETARY CLINTON IN PLACES LIKE PENNSYLVANIA, IT BECOMES NEARLY\nIMPOSSIBLE FOR DONALD TRUMP TO WIN.\nSO HE NEEDS SOME OF THOSE CORE OBAMA VOTERS TO STAY HOME.\nAT THE SAME TIME, FOR WHITE WORKING CLASS VOTERS IN THE RUST\nBELT TO COME OUT IN RECORD NUMBERS FOR DONALD TRUMP.\n>> JOSH, NOT TO TAKE YOU TO A CONCLUSION YOU DON'T ARRIVE AT,\nBUT WHAT -- ASSUMING THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS NOT VICTORIOUS, WHAT\nHAS IT ALL BEEN ABOUT? WHAT DOES THE VIBE IN SAN\nANTONIO TELL YOU ABOUT THE UNDERCURRENT, THE DRIVING\nMECHANICS HERE? >> I MEAN, THE VIBE QUITE\nFRANKLY WAS DETERMINATION AND EXCITEMENT.\nI'VE BEEN IN CAMPAIGNS WHERE IT IS CLEAR THAT A LOSS IS COMING,\nAND THAT IS NOT THE FEELING AT ALL IN TRUMP DIGITAL\nHEADQUARTERS IN SAN ANTONIO. BUT I THINK AS WE SAY IN THIS\nPIECE, THEY'RE LOOKING PAST THE ELECTION, WHETHER THEY WIN OR\nNOT. AND WHAT TRUMP HAS BUILT HERE IN\nTHIS SAN ANTONIO OPERATION, WHICH IS IMPRESSIVE, IS THIS\nLARGE AUDIENCE OF PEOPLE WHOSE NAMES AND E-MAIL ADDRESSES AND\nIN SOME CASES, CREDIT CARD NUMBERS, HE OWNS.\nSO THIS IS AN AUDIENCE THAT COULD CONCEIVABLY BE TRANSPORTED\nTO A TRUMP SOCIAL MEDIA NETWORK OR SOME OTHER PLATFORM DONALD\nTRUMP COULD TAKE AND WORK FROM, IF HE WANTS TO CONTINUE ON IN\nPOLITICS AND IN MEDIA. AND ALL THE INDICATIONS I GOT\nFROM PEOPLE AROUND TRUMP IS HE IS NOT GOING TO WALK AWAY IF HE\nLOSES THE ELECTION. HE WANTS TO CONTINUE TO EXERT\nHIS INFLUENCE ON AMERICAN POLITICS.\n>> I WANT TO GIVE VOICE TO YOUR NODDING.\n>> I THINK WE'VE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT WHAT THESE FINAL WEEKS ARE\nLIKE FOR HIM. HE DOES NOT HAVE A PATH TO 270.\nSTEVE KORNACKI LAID OUT CLEARLY, HIS BEST CASE SCENARIO IS TO A\nMAXIMUM OF 265. BUT HE ALSO SAID IN HIS OWN\nWORDS AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS CAMPAIGN, IT WILL HAVE ALL BEEN\nFOR NAUGHT IF HE LOSES. WE KNOW ABOUT THE TAPES THAT\nWERE TURNED OVER TO \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" THAT SAVING FACE IS\nESSENTIAL TO WHO HE IS. A SAVING FACE WAY OUT WOULD BE\nTO DO EXACTLY WHAT IS DESCRIBED IN THIS PIECE, TO TURN IT INTO\nSOMETHING BIGGER, TO TURN IT INTO A NEW AND MORE WORTHY\nMISSION, AND IN HIS EYES, A BUSINESS VENTURE IS PROBABLY\nSOMETHING THAT HE CAN EASILY AND AUTHENTICALLY SPIN INTO A MORE\nNOBLE MISSION. >> ROBERT COSTA, I'VE ASKED YOU\nTHIS BEFORE, BUT LIKE OUR COVERAGE OF THE LAST HURRICANE\nTHAT RAN UP THE COAST OF FLORIDA, ARE WE SEEING A\nTIGHTENING AT THE CORE IN TRUMP LAND?\n>> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS EVIDENT IS THE INFLUENCE OF\nSTEVE BANNON. THIS IS A CANDIDATE WHO REMAINS\nMOSTLY ISOLATED FROM THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\nAND THAT HAS CONSEQUENCES MOVING FORWARD.\nHE DOESN'T FEEL A DEEP AFFILIATION WITH THE GOP.\nHE'S A POPULIST, A NATIONALIST, AN INCENDIARY OUTSIDER.\n>> JOSH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING ON TONIGHT.\nLET'S JUST THINK WHAT RICHARD BEN CRAMER COULD DO\nMETAPHORICALLY WITH A PLANE OFF THE RUNWAY VIS-A-VIE THIS\nCAMPAIGN. ROBERT COSTA, DITTO FROM \"THE\nWASHINGTON POST.\" NICOLE WILL STICK AROUND.\nOUR FIRST BREAK, COMING UP, A CURRENT AND FORMER FIRST LADY\nTOGETHER ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL TODAY.\nTHIS IS \"THE 11th HOUR\" ON MSNBC.",

NICOLLE WALLACE REMAINS HERE IN\nTHE STUDIO WITH US. I WANT TO WELCOME MAC A NATIONAL\nREPORTER FOR \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" WHO COVERS NATIONAL\nPOLITICS AND SOCIAL JUSTICE ISSUES.\nWELCOME. IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE HEARD\nTONIGHT FROM DONALD TRUMP THAT COMPELS OUR ATTENTION.\nI'M GOING TO PLAY IT. WE'LL ALSO LISTEN TO IT AND\nREACT. >> AND WE'RE GOING TO WORK --\nYOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON WHERE YOU HAVE POCKETS OF --\nAREAS OF LAND, WHERE YOU HAVE THE INNER CITIES AND YOU HAVE SO\nMANY THINGS, SO MANY PROBLEMS, SO MANY HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE\nPROBLEMS. THE VIOLENCE, THE DEATH, THE\nLACK OF EDUCATION, NO JOBS. WE'RE GOING TO WORK WITH THE\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM\nOF THE INNER CITY. >> WHERE TO BEGIN?\n>> I THINK WHERE WE BEGIN IS THIS IDEA THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE\nFEEL HIGHLY OFFENDED BY THE WAY THIS IS THE WAY DONALD TRUMP IS\nAPPEALING TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS, THE AMERICA THAT HE THINKS\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS LIVE IN JUST DOESN'T REALLY EXIST FOR A LOT\nOF THE PEOPLE I TALK TO. I JUST WROTE A STORY ABOUT THE\nFACT THAT A LOT OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS SEE DONALD\nTRUMP AS JUST AN EXAMPLE OF A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT THEY'VE\nHAD TO DEAL WITH IN THEIR LIVES. I'VE TALKED TO PEOPLE WHO SAID\nTHEIR TEACHERS SAID THEY -- GOING TO DIE IN THIRD GRADE\nBEFORE THEY TURNED 18. SO THIS IS A DEEPLY, PERSONAL\nTHING FOR A LOT OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS.\nTHAT'S WHY HE'S POLLING AT ABOUT 4% WITH AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS.\n>> I WAS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING SARCASTIC.\nHOW COMFORTING TO KNOW THERE ARE NO KNOW WILL BE WHITE AND\nHISPANIC PEOPLE LIVING IN THE  . >> THAT'S WHAT HE'S IMPLYING.\nTHERE ARE RURAL PARTS IN PENNSYLVANIA AND OHIO THAT\nTHEY'RE DEALING WITH THE SAME THING.\n>> FOR NICOLLE, I HAVE CUED UP A SPECIAL MOMENT THAT UNFOLDED IN\nFRONT OF GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS. THIS IS HIS INTERVIEW WITH THE\nTRUMPS. >> I MIGHT JOIN HIM.\nWE WILL SEE. >> SHE'S ACTUALLY GOING TO MAKE\nTWO OR THREE SPEECHES. >> OH!\n>> SHE'S AMAZING. >> BREAKING NEWS TO MRS. TRUMP,\nAPPARENTLY. >> SHE IS AMAZING.\nAND I HAVE TO SAY, THERE WAS A MOMENT HE GAVE A SPEECH AT THE\nAL SMITH CHARITY DINNER, THE ONE REALLY FUNNY JOKE HE MADE WAS AT\nHER EXPERIENCE. SHE'S BEEN REMARKABLY GRACEFUL\nAT WHAT HAS TO HAVE BEEN SO PAINFUL FOR HER TO GO THROUGH.\nHE OBVIOUS HI DIDN'T TALK ABOUT DOING TWO OR THREE SPEECHES\nBEFORE HE ANNOUNCED IT IN THAT INTERVIEW WITH GEORGE\nSTEPHANOPOULOS. SO SHE CONSIDERS TO BE\nREMARKABLE TO ME AS SOMEBODY STANDING BY SOMEONE THAT HAS TO\nBE EXCRUCIATING. IT'S ALWAYS HARDER ON THE\nSPOUSES THAN THE CANDIDATE THEMSELVES, NO MATTER THE CRISIS\nOR ANYTHING ELSE. >> AND THIS CAN BE SAID\nCLINICALLY, THE BENCH STRENGTH ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, THE\nSURROGATES BEGINNING WITH THE FIRST LADY, I DON'T KNOW ANYONE\nIN PUBLIC LIFE WITH A HIGHER APPROVAL RATING RIGHT NOW.\n>> YEAH. YOU LOOK AT WHO HILLARY CLINTON\nCAN TURN TO, TO MAKE HER CASE, SHE CAN GO DOWN THE LINE,\nINCLUDING BERNIE SANDERS, WHO HAS A LOT OF WEIGHT AMONG YOUNG\nVOTERS AND YOU TURN TO MICHELLE OBAMA, SHE CAN MAKE THE CLOSING\nARGUMENTS FOR DEMOCRATS. AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS IS\nNOT ABOUT POLITICS, AND SHE'S SAYING HE'S GOING LOW, WE NEED\nTO GO HIGH AS A COUNTRY. SO THAT'S APPEALING TO NOT JUST\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS BUT AMERICANS AS A WHOLE.\n>> I WATCHED TODAY AND I REMEMBER THE SPEECH THAT SHE\nGAVE AFTER HIS ACCESS HOLLYWOOD CAME OUT AND I SAID IT WAS\nPERFECT. I THOUGHT TODAY WAS EVEN BETTER,\nBECAUSE SHE WAS SORT OF ADDRESSING SOME DISAFFECTION\nWITHIN THE OBAMA COALITION. IS THAT POSSIBLE FOR HER TO GET\nBETTER? >> I THINK HE'S DEFINITELY\nGETTING STRONGER. I THINK THE IDEA IS EVERYBODY\nWAS WONDERING HOW MUCH ARE YOU GOING TO SEE OF MICHELLE OBAMA?\nSHE WASN'T REALLY SOMEONE WHO WANTED TO CAMPAIGN HEAVILY.\nBUT THIS IDEA IS SHE'S MOTIVATED BY THE FACT THAT SHE'S MAKING\nTHE CASE ALSO FOR OBAMA'S LEGACY.\nSHE DOESN'T WANT THE PERSON WHO COMES AFTER HER HUSBAND TO BE\nTHE PERSON WHO IS SAYING THAT HER HUSBAND WAS ALMOST AN\nILLEGITIMATE PRESIDENT BECAUSE HE SUPPOSEDLY WASN'T BORN IN\nTHIS COUNTRY. SO I THINK HE IS GETTING INTO\nHIS STRIDE THERE. ALSO THE ENERGY IS THERE, AND I\nTHINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS, HILLARY CLINTON SPOKE FIRST\nTODAY. AND THAT TO ME WAS IN SOME WAYS\nSURPRISING, BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON I THINK IS ACKNOWLEDGING\nEVEN IN THE PLACEMENT OF WHERE SHE WENT, I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK\nAFTER MICHELLE OBAMA, I'M GOING TO LET HER GIVE THE CLOSING\nARGUMENT. I THINK THAT'S REMARKABLE FOR A\nCANDIDATE TO DO THAT. >> THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING PART\nOF OUR CONVERSATION TONIGHT.

JOE BIDEN, HIS SENATE CAREER WAS\nREALLY HIGHLIGHTED BY HIS PUSHING OF THE LEGISLATION AND\nSUCCESSFULLY ENACTING THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT AND\nTHIS IS WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO, IT'S CLASS WARFARIWARFARE.\nDONALD TRUMP, THINKS HE HAS A SILVER SPOON IN HIS MOUTH AND\nTRUMP LOOKS AT JOE BIDEN AND HE SAYS YOU KNOW YOU ARE A\nWASHINGTON ELITIST AND YOU NEED TO GET OUT OF TOWN.\n>> HMM, DAVID. >> YEAH, I WANT TO CUT VICE\nPRESIDENT BIDEN A LITTLE BIT OF SLACK HERE, BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A\nSCRANTON GUY TALKING TO A QUEENS GUY, TALKING ABOUT ONE'S\nDISRESPECTFUL COMMENTS ABOUT WOMEN, AND ON THE OTHER HAND,\nDONALD TRUMP DOES HAVE A POINT. IF TRUMP HAD STARTED THIS WAR OF\nWORDS WE IN THE MEDIA WOULD BE SAYING IT'S JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE\nOF TRUMP STIRRING UP SOME KIND OF HOSTILE RHETORIC, SO IT'S\nPROBABLY TIME FOR THIS ONE TO END.\n>> OR WHAT ARE WE DOING NOW LAUGHING AT BOTH OF THEM.\nANY WAYS LET'S MOVE ON. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WIKILEAKS,\nDAVID, BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON REALLY HASN'T ANSWER GOOD\nQUESTIONS ABOUT WIKILEAKS AND TRUMP IS STARTING TO PRESS THE\nCASE AGAINSTLER CAGAINST HER. CAN SHE RUN OUT THE FOR THE\nRUSSIANS STEALING INFORMATION? >> SHE'S GOING TO TRY AND RUN\nOUT THE. BETWEEN NOW AND ELECTION DAY\nWITH ALL THE STORIES GOING ON, IT IS GOING TO BE HARD FOR THE\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN UNLESS THEY JUST HAMMER THIS DAY, AFTER DAY,\nAFTER DAY, TO MAKE THIS CASE RESONATE WITH VOTERS ANY MORE\nTHAN IT HAS FOR THE LAST YEAR THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT\nIT, BUT I WILL SAY THAT IF CLINTON IS ELECTED -- I'M NOT\nPREDICTING IT -- BUT IF SHE'S ELECTED THIS IS NOT GOING TO GO\nAWAY. REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS ARE\nSTILL GOING TO LOOK INTO THIS BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME THINGS IN\nTHE WIKILEAKS THAT DO REFLECT POORLY ON HER INNER CIRCLE.\n>> THE NEWS OF HUGE PREMIUM INCREASES SHOULD HAVE DEMOCRATS\nBACK ON THEIR HEALS, MAYBE IN ANY OTHER CAMPAIGN IT WOULD.\nCLINTON HAS SAID THAT SHE'S GOING TO FIX IT.\nDO YOU THINK ANY VOTERS WILL CHANGE THEIR MIND BECAUSE OF\nOBAMACARE AT THIS POINT? >> SURE.\nI'M SURE SOME WILL, BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO CHANGE THE ELECTION.\nHAVING SAID THAT, YOU KNOW, DONALD TRUMP HAD FRAMED THE\nOBAMACARE A LITTLE BIT BETTER, HAD THIS INFORMATION OF THE\nPREMIUMS COME OUT SAY IN AUGUST OR SO, WHERE THE ARGUMENT COULD\nBE BUILT UP, HAD DONALD TRUMP NOT STEPPED OVERALL OF HIS\nMESSAGE, HILLARY CLINTON WOULD BE WAY DOWN IN THE POLLS, WITH\nTHE WIKILEAKS, WITH THE OBAMACARE, JUST WITH HER SECR\nSECRECY, WITH THE SERVER, EXCEPT THE FACT DONALD TRUMP ALWAYS\nSEEMS TO STEP ON HIS OWN MESSAGE.\n>> MARK, DAVID, THANK YOU,",

MR. TRUMP JOINS US NOW FROM\nOHIO. LET'S BEGIN WITH THE RIGGED\nBUSINESS. HOW DO YOU THINK THE ELECTION IS\nRIGGED? >> THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED, BILL,\nLOOKING AT THE MEDIA, HOW HORRIBLE, THEY ARE, HOW FALSE\nTHEY ARE AND NEGATIVE TOWARD ME. 93% OF THE STORIES THEY WRITE\nARE NEGATIVE, IF IT'S POSITIVE, THEY'LL FIND A WAY TO MAKE IT\nNEGATIVE. I USED TO GET GREAT PUBLICITY.\nNOW, IT DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE BUT THE SYSTEM IS\nRIGGED AND I THINK THE BIGGEST RIGGING IS WHAT HAPPENED WITH\nTHE FBI AND JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WITH RESPECT TO HILLARY CLINTON.\nSHE IS GUILTY AND SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT.\n>> OKAY, WHAT ABOUT THE VOTE ITSELF?\nYOU KNOW?

DO YOU BELIEVE THAT?\n>> WELL, I LOOKED AT PEW RESEARCH.\nTHERE ARE 1.8 MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE DEAD WHO ARE REGISTERED TO\nVOTE. SO I WONDER HOW THAT HAPPENS.\nTHERE ARE 2.8 MILLION PEOPLE REGISTERED TO VOTE IN TWO\nSTATES. I WATCH PRESIDENT OBAMA, EIGHT\nYEARS AGO, ON FOX, ACTUALLY, JUST THE OTHER NIGHT, BUT\nWATCHED PRESIDENT OBAMA EIGHT YEARS AGO TALKING ABOUT HOW\nCHICAGO IS RIGGED. AND THAT IS, HE WAS DOING IT\nWITH A WINK. >> NOW, MENTIONING PRESIDENT\nOBAMA. >> HE SAID IT HAPPENED.\n>> HERE IS WHAT HIS WIFE SAID TODAY IN NORTH CAROLINA.\nGO. >> WHEN YOU HEAR FOLKS TALKING\nABOUT A GLOBAL CONSPIRACY AND SAYING THIS ELECTION IS RIGGED,\nUNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO GET YOU TO STAY HOME.\nTHEY'RE TRYING TO CONVINCE YOU THAT YOUR VOTE DOESN'T MATTER.\nAND THAT THE OUTCOME HAS BEEN DETERMINED AND YOU SHOULDN'T BE\nBOTHER MAKING YOUR VOICE HEARD, THEY'RE TRYING TO TAKE AWAY YOUR\nHOPE. >> HER HUSBAND DID IT EIGHT\nYEARS AGO, SAYING THE AND IT'S SOMETHING TO LIKE HE'S LUCKY\nHE'S IN CHICAGO.

I HEAR IN DIFFERENT PLACES I'M\nHEARING RECORDS THAT ARE INCREDIBLE.\nI THINK THEY'RE VOTING FOR ME. THEY HAVE A LOT OF DONALD TRUMP\nCAPS ON THAT. THEY HAVE RECORD LINES SO WE'RE\nGOING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS. I'M RIGHT NOW IN OHIO AND I WILL\nTELL YOU WHAT, IT'S INCREDIBLE, THE ENTHUSIASM AND CROWDS AND\nWHOLE THING. >> THERE IS, IN FRONT YOU'RE OUT\nIN FRONT IN OHIO. >> DO YOU THINK CERTAIN NEWS\nORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS WHEN THEY POLL,\nHAVE THEIR THUMB ON THE SCALE AND WANT HILLARY CLINTON TO COME\nOUT ON TOP OF THE SCALE?

I HEAR THAT IT WAS KIND OF A\nSPORTY LANDING, AND MAYBE IT FISH TAILS A LITTLE BIT COMING\nDOWN THE RUNWAY. >> WE KNEW THERE WAS BAD\nWEATHER, BECAUSE THE FLIGHT WAS DELAYED COMING OUT OF IOWA.\nIT TOOK OFF, THERE WAS AN ORIGINAL BOUNCE OFF THE TARMAC.\nTHE ODD PART IS THIS HAS BECOME NORM WALL THE CAMPAIGN PLANE.\nWE'VE COME TO EXPECT ROUGH LANDINGS WITH THIS PARTICULAR\n737. BUT IT SWERVED OFF TO THE RIGHT\nAND YOU'RE LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW AND YOU SEE THE ROAD 50,\n100 YARDS AND CAME TO A DEAD STOP.\nTHAT'S WHEN WE LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW AND YOU COULD SEE THE GAS\nSTATION AND WE REALIZED THIS TIME WE WERE OFF THE TARMAC.\n>> YOU WERE LOOKING RIGHT AT THE GRAND CENTRAL PARKWAY.\nAT LaGUARDIA, IT'S EITHER THE HIGHWAY OR THE WATER, SURROUNDED\nON ALL SIDES. THUS WHAT LOOKS LIKE THIS CAKED\nHEAVY SNOW ON THE GROUND, THIS IS A KIND OF POROUS CONCRETE\nTHAT DID ITS JOB TONIGHT. IT HAS BEEN THERE FOR A DECADE.\nIT'S SUPPOSED TO STOP A PLANE IN ITS TRACKS.\nSO WHAT ABOUT TRUMP'S WORDING THAT YOU CAME CLOSE TO GRAVE,\nGRAVE DANGER? I SUPPOSE WHILE THIS THING WAS\nCOMING TO A REST, IT MIGHT HAVE FELT THIS WAY.\n>> YOU COULD SMELL THE RUBBER. AS WE STARTED TO VEER OFF AND\nSUDDENLY COME TO THE COMPLETE STAND STILL, TO BE HONEST WITH\nYOU, THE GOVERNOR GOT UP QUICKLY, HE CAME TO THE BACK,\nWANTED TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY WAS OKAY.\nTO BE HONEST WITH YOU, THE CAMPAIGN AND THE STAFF HAVE\nGOTTEN USED TO THESE ROUGH LANDINGS.\nHE CAME BACK, EVERYBODY WAS SAFE.\nTHEN YOU SEE THE FIREFIGHTERS COME ON TO THE PLANE SAYING\nEVERYBODY PLEASE GET OFF AND THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE SEEING\nEVERYTHING THAT IS TORN UP AND YOU SEE THE ROAD AND I BELIEVE\nTHAT GAS STATION OVER THERE. THAT'S WHEN IT WAS REALITY THAT\nWE WERE CLOSE TO SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT MORE SERIOUS.\n>> AS MUCH AS I HATE TO SAY IT, IT'S WRITTEN ABOUT SPORADICALLY,\nTHE FACT THAT PER CAPITA, WE'VE LOST A LOT OF POLITICIANS AND\nROCK STARS, AND WHAT THEIR DEATHS OFTEN HAVE IN COMMON,\nCHARTER AIRCRAFT, WE GOT A LATE EVENT, WE CAN RUSH THE WEATHER.\nIT HAPPENS. YOU GUYS ARE LIVING IN THE AIR\nTHESE DAYS. >> NEBRASKA TO IOWA TO NEW YORK.\nTOMORROW, NORTH CAROLINA, NEW HAMPSHIRE.\nWE'RE UP AND DOWN CONSTANTLY ON THIS PLANE.\n>> HAVE YOU CALLED HOME IF >> I CALLED HOME.\nI TOLD THEM WE HAD TO GET THE CAMERA SET UP FIRST.\n>> HE'S FINE. HE LOOKS LIKE A MILLION BUCKS.\nVAUGHN, GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\n>> SORRY FOR THE LACK OF A TIE. >> QUITE ALL RIGHT.\nYOU WERE ON THE JOB.",

YOU SEE THE HEADLINE, \"CLINTON\nEYES BIDEN FOR SECRETARY OF STATE.\"\nTHE REPORT NOTES THAT THE CURRENT VICE PRESIDENT IS AT THE\nTOP OF THE CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN SO-CALLED SHORT LIST FOR\nPOTENTIAL SECRETARIES OF STATE, WERE CLINTON TO WIN THE WHITE\nHOUSE. IT IS FAIR TO ASSUME HER\nSECRETARY OF STATE WOULD BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF HER INNER\nCIRCLE, GIVEN THE FOUR YEARS SHE SPENT DOING THAT JOB EVERY DAY.\nNICOLLE WALLACE IS HERE WITH US TO TAKE ON THIS STORY AND MUCH\nMORE. MY FAVORITE LINE IN THIS STORY\nIS, NEITHER CLINTON NOR HER AIDES HAVE YET TOLD BIDEN.\nLET'S CONSIDER BIDEN TOLD. >> I CAN CONFIRM THAT HE'S SEEN\nTHE STORY. >> LET'S ALSO ASSUME YOU'RE IN A\nTRANSITION FOR WHAT THEY THINK WILL BE -- WHAT THEY HOPE WILL\nBE A WINNING CAMPAIGN. THIS IS GOING TO BE A GUY ON\nSHORT LISTS FOR MORE THAN ONE JOB, CORRECT?\n>> AND YOU'VE COVERED MORE THAN A FEW TRANSITIONS AND YOU\nUNDERSTAND THAT A TRANSITION TEAM IS SEPARATED FROM THE\nCAMPAIGN. THE CAMPAIGN, THEY'RE FOCUSED ON\nWIN THING ELECTION. THEY HAVE NOT TURNED TO STAFFING\nUP IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM. THEY ALSO POINT OUT IT WOULD BE\nMORE REMARKABLE IF JOE BIDEN, WHO SPENT HIS CAREER IN THE\nSENATE ON THE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE, WAS NOT ON THE LIST\nTO BE THE SECRETARY OF STATE. HE'S ONE OF THE MOST EXPERIENCED\nINDIVIDUALS IN THIS AREA AND ONE OF THE LEADING VOICES IN THE\nCOUNTRY ON MATTERS OF FOREIGN POLICY.\nFROM A SOURCE CLOSE TO JOE BIDEN, THERE IS SOME OPENNESS TO\nCONTINUING TO SERVE, BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF HIS ROLE TODAY.\nTODAY HE'S DEEPLY EMBROILED IN THE CRISIS IN SYRIA, AND WHAT\nBECAME HIS PORTFOLIO AS VICE PRESIDENT WAS A BIG BASKET OF\nFOREIGN POLICY. >> BUT THEY ARE SO WORRIED ABOUT\nCOMPLACENCY, STORIES LIKE THIS. >> THIS IS NOT A STORY THEY\nWANTED OUT THERE. AND THIS IS NOT THEIR FOCUS FROM\nTHE CAMPAIGN'S PERSPECTIVE. THERE IS A SEPARATE STAFF, A\nTRANSITION IS SOMETHING THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS ALSO WITH STAFF\nTHAT IS NOT FLYING AROUND HIM, KELLYANNE CONWAY IS NOT PART OF\nTHAT OPERATION, CHRIS CHRISTIE IS.\nBUT THE TRANSITION IS A SEPARATE ORGANIZATION AND THIS IS NOT THE\nCAMPAIGN'S FOCUS TONIGHT. >> DON'T MOVE AN INCH, WE HAVE\nMILES TO GO BEFORE WE STOP TALKING.\nTURNING TO TRUMP, THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE WAS ON THE TRAIL IN OHIO\nTODAY. WHILE ATTACKING HIS OPPONENT,\nWONDERED ALLOWED WHY WE STILL EVEN NEED TO HOLD THIS ELECTION.\n>> HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO RAISE TAXES ON SMALL BUSINESSES\nUP TO 45%. [ CROWD BOOING ]\nWHAT A DIFFERENCE. YOU KNOW, WHAT A DIFFERENCE THIS\nIS. IN JUST THINKING TO MYSELF RIGHT\nNOW, WE JUST SHOULD CANCEL THE ELECTION AND JUST GIVE IT TO\nTRUMP, RIGHT? [ APPLAUSE ]\nWHAT ARE WE HAVING IT FOR? HER POLICIES ARE SO BAD.\n>> ALSO WITH US TONIGHT, ONE OF THE TWO AUTHORS OF TODAY'S\nMUST-READ POLITICAL STORY OUT OF BLOOMBERG BUSINESS WEEK ABOUT\nTHIS TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

YOU SPEAK FOR A LIVING, I SPEAK\nFOR A LIVING. SHE DOES THING WHEN IS SHE TALKS\nTHAT ARE SO REMARKABLE, IN THE INTIMACY N\nINTIMACY, IN THEIR FEEL.

HE'S USED TO GETTING THOSE\nPEOPLE, BUT THEY COME OUT TO SEE HIM.\nI THINK THE CROWD TODAY WAS COMING OUT TO SEE MICHELLE\nOBAMA, AS MUCH AS ANYTHING, AND THOSE VOTES DON'T TRANSFER.\nIN FACT -- >> YOU'RE MISSING A KEY THING\nTHOUGH. >> GO AHEAD, HILLARY.\nPLEASE SET THIS MAN STRAIGHT. >> ALL YOURS.\n>> TWOFOLD.

THERE IS NO QUESTION WE'VE SEEN\nIT OVERWHELMING AMOUNT OF ENTHUSIASM NOW FOR YOUNG WOMEN,\nFOR HILLARY CLINTON, ON THESE ISSUES THAT MICHELLE OBAMA\nTRANSLATED FOR AMERICA. SHE CREATED AN ENERGY AROUND\nTHESE ISSUES. >> AND LET ME ADD --\n>> AND SHE DID IT FOR ALL OF AMERICA.\nTO SAY THAT IT DIDN'T TRANSLATE AT ALL, THAT PEOPLE AREN'T\nPAYING ATTENTION IS JUST WRONG. >> HER LAST NAME IS STILL OBAMA\nAND SHE WAS IN NORTH CAROLINA WHERE OBAMACARE IS GOING UP 40%.\n>> OBAMA, THE MOST POPULAR CURRENT PRESIDENT OF THE LAST\nSEVERAL YEARS. >> IT DOESN'T MATTER TO THESE\nYOUNG PEOPLE WHOSE HEALTHCARE IS GOING UP 40% IF THEY LIVE IN\nNORTH CAROLINA.

I CAN'T REMEMBER AT LEAST IN MY\nLIFETIME, PEOPLE LOVED LAURA AND BARBARA BUSH AND NANCY REAGAN.\nWHY CAN'T PEOPLE LOVE MICHELLE OBAMA?\n>> SHE'S VERY EFFECTIVE. SHE GIVE THE BEST SPEECH IN THE\nDNC HANDS DOWN F.. IF SHE WANTS TO RUN FOR\nSOMETHING, SHE'S VERY GOOD AT IT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\nI GET YOU, DON, 100%. I DON'T KNOW LOVE FOR THE FIRST\nLADY IS WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO VOTE ON WHEN THEY'RE HURTING\nECONOMICALLY, WHEN THEY'RE SCARED ABOUT TERRORISM, WHETHER\nTHEY'RE CASTING THEIR BALLOT, I DON'T KNOW IF LOVE FOR THE FIRST\nLADY IS GOING TO BE THE BENE\nBENEFACTOR. >> I WILL TELL YOU YOUNG PEOPLE,\nESPECIALLY MILLENNIAL, THE HIGHEST APPROVAL RATING WITH ANY\nPOLITICIAN WOULD BE MICHELLE AND B\nBARACK OBAMA AMONG THAT DEMOGRAPHIC.\n>> FIRST OF ALL YOU SAY THESE NOT A THOUGHT LEADER, I THINK\nTHAT'S HIGHLY -- I'M NOT GOING TO SAY IT'S OFFENSIVE, IT'S JUST\nWRONG. SHE'S ACTUALLY CHANGED THE\nNATIONAL CONVERSATION WHEN IT COMES TO CHILDREN'S FITNESS,\nCHILDREN'S HEALTH, WHEN IT COMES TO THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IN\nOUR COUNTRY, OUR FUTURE GENERATION, AND ALSO OUR\nVETERANS, SHE'S BEEN RIGHT OUT THERE AS BIG AS ANYBODY.\nBUT MUCH MORE IMPORTANTLY, IF YOU TRY TO PUT HER DOWN, YOU'RE\nBY YOURSELF. DONALD TRUMP, WHO SLAPS BACK AT\nEVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO EVER SAYS ANYTHING BAD ABOUT HIM,\nEVEN IF IT'S A GOLD STAR MOM, IF IT'S SOME UNKNOWN BEAUTY\nPAGEANT, HE'S UP -- YOU CAN'T MESS WITH DONALD TRUMP.\n>> BUT MICHELLE OBAMA HAS GONE OUT --\n>> YOU HAD YOUR TURN. YOU HAD YOUR TURN.\nMICHELLE OBAMA HAS GONE AFTER HIM SPEECH, AFTER SPEECH, AFTER\nSPEECH, AND DONALD TRUMP HAS NOT BROKEN BREATH TO SAY ONE WORD,\nONE TWEET, NOTHING BECAUSE HE RECOGNIZES THE POWER THAT HE\nHAS. >> CONGRESSMAN QUICKLY I HAVE TO\nGO TO BREAK. >> NUMBER ONE SHE'S TRYING TO\nPROP UP HILLARY CLINTON, WHO BRINGS NO ENTHUSIASM.\nTHAT'S WHY THE CROWD WAS BIG TODAY, BECAUSE OF MICHELLE\nOBAMA. >> BIG CROWDS DON'T MEAN BIG\nVOTES, AND BERNIE. >> LET HIM FINISH.\n>> AND MICHELLE OBAMA CAN GO OUT THERE AND SAY ALL THOSE GOOD\nTHINGS ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON, BUT IT'S STILL HILLARY CLINTON,\nAND PEOPLE ARE NOT ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THAT.\nTHAT'S WHY SHE CAN'T GET A BIG CROWD.\n>> HERE'S THE THING -- OKAY. >> AND BEYOND --\n>> QUICKLY I GOTTA. >> -- BEHIND THE CHEERING YOU\nHAVE OBAMACARE, YOU HAVE A WEAK ECONOMY, YOU DON'T HAVE HOPE OR\nJOBS FOR THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO NEED JOBS WHO ARE GOING OUT IN\nTHE WORKPLACE. THEY'RE VERY UNEASY ABOUT THE\nECONOMY. THEY'RE VERY UNEASY ABOUT\nNATIONAL SECURITY. >> ALL THE PEOPLE YOU MENTION\nAUDIO. >> YOU CAN TRY AND MAKE THIS\nCASE. YOUNG PEOPLE ARE FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON. >> PEOPLE OF COLOR WHO LIVE IN\nCERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS, MICHELLE OBAMA IS EFFECTIVE AT SPEAKING\nTO THEM.

HE DIDN'T GO IN THE CITY LIMITS.\nHE'S STILL ADDRESSING THE ISSUES.\nYOU KNOW, YOU -- HE IS A GUY WHOSE CREATED JOBS AND IF HE HAD\nA HISTORY OF DISCRIMINATION, THE \"NEW YORK TIMES\" AND THE\n\"WASHINGTON POST\" WOULD MAKE SURE EVERYBODY IN AMERICA KNEW\nABOUT IT, BUT HE DOES NOT. >> AND THEY HAVE.\nIT'S MY TURN. >> THEY DID.\nLET ME SAY A COUPLE THINGS ABOUT POVERTY.\nYOU HAVE DEMOCRATS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN GOOD ENOUGH ON URBAN\nPOVERTY. YOU HAVE REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE\nLET RURAL FOLKS DOWN AND IF YOU WANT A CONVERSATION ABOUT\nPOVERTY, I WELCOME THAT.

DELL GO TO.\nSAFE COMMUNITIES, GREAT EDUCATION, HIGH PAYING JOBS.\nIF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS AND BREAK DOWN ISSUES ECONOMICALLY\nIN THE BLACK COMMUNITY THEY'VE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED\nBY VIOLENCE, A BAD EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AND THE LACK OF ECONOMIC\nOPPORTUNITY. THIS TO ME SEEMS TO BE -- MUST\nBE A LONG STANDING PROMISE THAT REPUBLICANS SHOULD BE MAKING\nEVERY YEAR, NOT JUST CAMPAIGN YEARS.\n>> YEAH. WELL, BETTER LATE THAN NEVER.\nTHE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS BEEN TARDY WHEN IT COMES TO FOCUSING\nON THE DOWNTRODDEN COMMUNITIES. BOTH ON THE INNER CITY, SOME OF\nOUR RURAL COMMUNITIES. AND WHENEVER I TALK ABOUT THAT\nWITH DONALD TRUMP, HE GETS VERY ANIMATED FROM THE VERY BEGINNING\nAND HE UNDERSTANDS THAT THESE COMMUNITIES ARE VITAL TO THE\nHEALTH OF OUR NATION. AND YOU CAN'T HAVE A SUCCESSFUL\nNATION WITHOUT THIS. BUT SOME OF THE KEYS ARE A GOOD\nEDUCATION BECAUSE THAT CHANGES THE TRAJECTORY OF ONE'S LIFE.\n>> WELL THAT'S WHAT YOUR MOTHER DID FOR YOU.\n>> AND OPPORTUNITIES. >> YOUR MOTHER TOOK YOU OFF THE\nSTREETS AND YOUR FRIENDS AND SHE SAID YOU GOT TO READ.\nYOU'VE GOT TO STUDY. AND TOOK AWAY YOUR GAMES AND\nYOUR TV AND YOU KNOW, LOOK AT WHAT YOU BECAME, ONE OF THE BEST\nSURGEONS IN HISTORY. >> WELL IT REALLY DIFFERS FROM\nWHAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE OFFERED. YOU KNOW THEY SAY I'M GOING TO\nGIVE YOU THE HOUSING SUBSIDY. I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU FREE\nHEALTH CARE. I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU FOOD\nSTAMPS. AND THAT'S NOT PARTICULARLY\nHELPFUL. WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS PROVIDE A\nPATHWAY. THE MECHANISM SO THAT PEOPLE CAN\nCLIMB OUT OF A STATE OF DEPENDENCY.\nI HAVE HEARD SOME PEOPLE CRITICIZE DONALD TRUMP SAYING HE\nTHINKS THAT ALL BLACKS LIVE IN THE GETTO AND ARE POOR.\nOF COURSE HE DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT.\nHE KNOWS BETTER. BUT HE IS CONCENTRATING ON THE\nAREA OF WEAKNESS AND AN AREA THAT WE NEED TO STRENGTHEN.\nWE ONLY HAVE 330 MILLION PEOPLE. >> IF YOU LOOK AT THE OBAMA\nEIGHT YEARS, ONE IN FIVE AMERICAN FAMILIES, NOBODY\nWORKING, 8 MILLION MORE PEOPLE IN POVERTY.\nBLACKS/HISPANICS HAVE BEEN NEGATIVE TYLY IMPACTED BY\nLIBERAL POLICIES. BUT EVERY FOUR YEAR INNER CITY\nAMERICA, IN COME THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WE NEED YOUR VOES AND THE\nREPUBLICANS THEY'RE RACISTS DON'T VOTE FOR THEM.\n>> WHAT WE'RE MOST HURT BY IS WORKING CLASS AMERICANS, WE'RE\nTHE ONES THAT ARE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY.\nI WROTE ABOUT THIS TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO.\nIT'S AFRICAN-AMERICANS THAT ARE THE VICTIMS OF AMNESTY WHEN THEY\nSEE HIGHER COMPETITION FOR JOBS, LOWER WAGES BECAUSE OF ILLEGAL\nIMMIGRATION. I DON'T THINK THERE'S BEEN\nENOUGH ATTENTION PAID TO THE FACT THAT DONALD TRUMP'S\nPLATFORM REALLY IS, FOR THAT REASON ALONE A\nPRO-AFRICAN-AMERICAN PLATFORM. >> WHY EVERY FOUR YEARS -- THERE\nWAS A RASMUSSEN POLL OUT. WHY STILL SUCH A LOW NUMBER.\nIN OTHER WORDS, DEMOCRATS SEEM TO HAVE A LOCK, A MONOPOLY ON\nTHE DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS? >> BECAUSE OF THE MEDIA NOISE.\nYOU NEED JOBS, YOU NEED LESS COMPETITION.\nAMNESTY IS WHAT'S HURTING YOU. BUSINESS REGULATION, BAD TRADE\nDEALS ARE HURTING YOU. WHEN YOU VOTE TRUMP YOU'RE\nVOTING FOR YOURSELF. THAT'S INDISPUTABLE.\n>> WHAT DO YOU THINK, DR. CARSON.\nWE SEE ALL OF THE BALLS UP IN THE AIR, WIKILEAKS, PROJECT\nVERITAS. MY QUESTION TO YOU IS DO YOU\nBELIEVE THESE POLLS ARE WRONG? DO YOU THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE\nA BREXIT EFFECT. DO YOU THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE\nTHAT AREN'T GOING TO ADMIT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR DONALD\nTRUMP? >> YES, I DO BELIEVE THAT THE\nPOLLS ARE SKEWED. ONE OF THE POLLS LAST WEEK, I\nTHINK IT WAS ABC HAD HILLARY 12 POINTS AHEAD BUT THEY ONLY\nPOLLED 29% REPUBLICANS. IF THEY POLLED 29% DEMOCRATS,\nTHEY'D HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT NUMBER.\nAND THEY TEND NOT TO TALK ABOUT IBD AND RASMUSSEN AND THE ONES\nTHAT LOOK GOOD FOR TRUMP. THAT'S UNIVERSAL AMONG THE\nMAINSTREAM MEDIA. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE,\nPARTICULARLY IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY IF YOU ASK THEM WHO\nTHEY'RE VOTING FOR, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SAY TRUMP.\nTHEY DON'T TRUST YOU. THERE'S NEGATIVE RAMIFICATIONS\nFOR THEM. AND IN THE WHITE COMMUNITY THEY\nDON'T WANT TO SAY IT IF YOU VOTE FOR TRUMP YOU'RE A RISIST.\nTHAT'S THE NARRATIVE PUT FORTH. OF COURSE IT'S FULL OF CRAP.\n>> I LOVE WHEN YOU SAY FULL OF CRAP.\nNOW YOU SOUND LIKE ME. >> THERE'S AN INTIMIDATION\nFACTOR THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO ADMIT THEY'RE VOTING FOR TRUMP.\nWE'RE SEEING IT COME OUT IN FLORIDA.\nSUPPOSEDLY CLINTON WAS UP AND NOW IN EARLY VOTING DONALD TRUMP\nIS UP.

SO WE COME TO A HARD STOP.\nYOU LOOK OUT THE WINDOW, YOU CAN SEE THE GAS STATION, MAYBE 50,\n100 YARDS AWAY, THE FENCE, HOLY COW, THE SMELL OF RUBBER COMES\nUP. AND YOU'RE LIKE, OKAY, WE'RE\nUSED TO ROUGH LANDINGS, BUT THE SMELL OF RUBBER DOESN'T USUALLY\nCOME UP. >> I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE YOU\nENDED UP.

ALL OF THEM.\n13 DAYS LATER, THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS RELEASED NO\nEVIDENCE ABOUT ANY OF THOSE ACCUSATIONS.\nAND NOW, WITH JUST 11 DAYS LEFT IN THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, A\n12th WOMAN HAS COME FORWARD, ACCUSING DONALD TRUMP OF\nGRABBING HER. NINY LOCHSANEN SAYS HE GRABBED\nHER MOMENTS BEFORE SHE APPEARED ON THE LATE SHOW WITH DAVID\nLETTERMAN. HE OWNED THE PAGEANT AT THAT\nTIME. NBC NEWS HASN'T CONFIRMED THESE\nNEW ALLEGATIONS. SHY ALSO TOLD A FINNISH\nNEWSPAPER, SOMEBODY TOLD ME THERE THAT TRUMP LIKED ME,\nBECAUSE I LOOKED LIKE MELANIA, WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER.\nIT LEFT ME DISGUSTED. IN AN INTERVIEW TAPED BEFORE THE\nLATEST ACCUSATIONS FROM THE FORMER MS. FINLAND, MELANIA\nTRUMP SAID THIS. >> THEY WERE, THEY WERE LIES.\nAND, AS I SAID BEFORE, ALL THE ACCUSATIONS, THEY SHOULD BE\nHANDLED IN A COURT OF LAW. >> SO YOU BELIEVE THE LAWSUIT\nSHOULD GO FORWARD? >> YES, I BELIEVE THAT, AND\nBECAUSE TO ACCUSE SOMEBODY WITHOUT EVIDENCE, IT'S VERY\nHURTFUL, AND IT'S VERY DAMAGING AND UNFAIR.\n>> THE LAWSUITS THAT GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS REFERRED TO OF\nCOURSE WERE THE ONES DONALD TRUMP THREATENED TO SUE HIS\nACCUSERS. ATTORNEY GLORIA ALLRED\nREPRESENTS THREE OF THOSE SUPPORTERS, ALSO IS A HILLARY\nCLINTON SUPPORTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING\nUS TONIGHT. >> THANK YOU.\n>> WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION TO THIS THREAT, AGAIN TODAY, ISSUED\nNOW BY BOTH DONALD TRUMP AND MELANIA TRUMP OF SUING YOUR\nCLIENTS AND ALL OF THE ACCUSERS OF DONALD TRUMP?\n>> WELL, LAWRENCE, HE IS THREATENING TO SUE THE \"NEW YORK\nTIMES,\" THE ACCUSERS THAT ACCUSE HIM OF ASSAULTING THEM.\nTHE NBC, AND GOD KNOWS WHO ELSE HE'S PLANNING TO SUE.\nBUT I GUESS HE DOESN'T WANT TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT HIS\nOWN WORDS WERE ON THE \"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD\" TAPES.\nTHIS IS RIDICULOUS. HAS HE NEVER HEARD OF THE FIRST\nAMENDMENT? HAS HE NEVER HEARD OF FREE\nSPEECH? THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO\nCOME TO THIS COUNTRY, BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO EXERCISE\nTHE FREE SPEECH THAT THEY CANNOT EXERCISE IN MANY PARTS OF THE\nWORLD. IN FACT, IF THEY DO EXERCISE IT\nAND CRITICIZE THEIR PRESIDENT OR EVEN SOMEONE WHO MIGHT WISH TO\nBE PRESIDENT, THEY FACE POSSIBLE ARRESTS, POSSIBLE PROSECUTION.\nWE HAVE THAT WONDERFUL FIRST AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES\nCONSTITUTION, FREE SPEECH, AND MR. TRUMP HAS TO UNDERSTAND THAT\nHE SHOULD NOT BE THREATENING ANYONE WHO JUST DISPLEASES HIM,\nCRITICIZES HIM, HE NEEDS TO GET OVER IT.\nLET HIM GIVE HIS DEFENSE WITHOUT BULLYING HIS WAY INTO THE WHITE\nHOUSE AND THEN SPENDING HIS TIME, IF GOD FORBID, HE GETS\nTHERE, SITTING IN DEPOSITIONS AS YOU JUST SAID, WITH ALL OF THE\nPEOPLE THAT HE'S SUED. I MEAN, HOW IS HE GOING TO DEAL\nWITH ANY MAJOR CRISIS OF OUR NATION IF THERE IS ONE, IF HE'S\nSITTING IN A DEPOSITION AND TRYING TO DEFEND THE LAWSUITS,\nWHICH, BY THE WAY, MIGHT BE FILED AGAINST HIM OR IF HE DOES\nFILE AGAINST THE WOMEN WOULD HE MIGHT FACE A LAWSUIT THEN, A\nCROSS COMPLAINT, BECAUSE HE'S ALLEGED ACTIONS THAT ARE, HE'S\nALLEGED THAT THEY HAVE DEFAMED HIM, AND THEY MAY ALLEGE THAT HE\nDEFAMED THEM, BY CALLING THEM LIARS, BY SAYING THEIR CLAIMS\nARE FABRICATION, THAT IT'S FICTION.\nBE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR, MR. TRUMP, BECAUSE YOU JUST\nMIGHT GET IT. >> LET ME GET YOUR REACTION TO\nTHIS LATEST THREAT ISSUED IN THE LAST HOUR AND A HALF OF SUING\nNBC FOR THE RELEASE OF THE ACCESSION HOLLYWOOD VIDEO.\nCAN YOU SEE ANY CAUSE OF ACTION IN THAT?\n>> WELL, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL THE TRUE FACTS ARE,\nLAWRENCE. AND I CERTAINLY DON'T GET MY\nFACTS FROM DONALD TRUMP. GIVEN THE LIST OF LIES THAT HE\nHAS SAID ABOUT SO MANY PEOPLE, THEY'RE ALL LISTED ON THE\nINTERNET, I MEAN, YOU CAN'T EVEN KEEP UP WITH THEM.\nSO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE KNEW THAT HIS MIC WAS HOT.\nI DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CONTRACTS SAY, IF ANYTHING, ABOUT WHETHER,\nWHAT HE WAS SAYING WHEN HE WAS MIKED, COULD BE USED AT ANY\nOTHER TIME. I DON'T KNOW HOW THOSE TAPES\nULTIMATELY BECAME PUBLIC, WHETHER NBC HAD ANYTHING TO DO\nWITH THEM, HOW IT CAME INTO POSSESSION OF SOMEONE.\nTHESE ARE JUST UNKNOWN FACTS, SO I CAN'T SPECULATE.\nUNLIKE DONALD TRUMP, UNLESS I HAVE THE TRUE FACTS, I DON'T\nDRAW CONCLUSIONS. BUT WHY DON'T YOU, NBC, JUST SAY\nGAME ON, DONALD TRUMP, IF THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS TO DO, IF HE WANTS\nTO FIGHT IT OUT IN A LAWSUIT, OKAY, HE'LL FIGHT IT OUT IN A\nLAWSUIT. >> QUICKLY BEFORE WE GO, WHAT\nWOULD BE YOUR DEFENSE STRATEGY IF DONALD TRUMP DID FILE ONE OF\nTHESE LAWSUITS? >> WELL, I CAN TELL YOU THAT\nHE'S NOT GOING TO MAKE WOMEN COWER.\nTHOSE DAYS OF BULLYING WOMEN, AND MANY WOMEN ARE STILL BEING\nBULLIED AT HOME, IN THEIR WORKPLACE, IN THEIR COMMUNITY,\nAND WE'RE JUST NOT GOING TO TAKE IT ANYMORE.\nTHESE WOMEN, IF THEY ARE SUED BY DONALD TRUMP, AT LEAST THE ONES\nTHAT I REPRESENT, WE HAVE A, I'M GOING TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND THEM.\nWE HAVE ARMIES OF ATTORNEYS WHO ARE GOING TO BE AVAILABLE TO\nEVEN REPRESENT PERHAPS THOSE  THERE'S GOING TO BE A\nWELL-FUNDED DEFENSE. SO ALL YOUR ATTEMPTS TO MAKE\nWOMEN COWER IN FEAR, MR. TRUMP, ARE GOING TO BE COMPLETE LAY\nUNSUCCESSFUL, AS TO ME, AS I HAVE SAID, SMARTER, RICHER AND\nMORE FAMOUS PEOPLE THAN YOU, MR. TRUMP, HAVE TRIED TO THREATEN ME AND FAILED.\n>> YOU SOUND EAGER TO GET HIM UNDER OATH IN A DEPOSITION.\n>> IT WOULD BE MY PLEASURE. >> THANK YOU FOR JOINING US\nTONIGHT, REALLY APPRECIATE IT.",

HE JOINS ME.\nGOOD EVENING, HOW YOU DOING, EVAN?\n>> GREAT TO BE WITH YOU, DON, I'M DOING WELL, THANKS.\nTHE LATEST MONTMOUTH POLL, YOU COME IN CLOSELY AT 28%.\nWHY ARE YOU DOING SO WELL THERE? >> MOST OF THE OTHER POLLS HAVE\nUS IN A DEADLOCKED TIE OR HAVE US UP BY FOUR POINTS OR SO EVEN\nABOVE DONALD TRUMP. SO WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT WHAT'S\nHAPPENING HERE. WE CAME HERE AND ARE SPENDING\nTIME IN UTAH AND IN THE MOUNTAIN WEST, BECAUSE THESE ARE THE\nSTATES THAT REJECTED HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP.\nTHESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR A BETTER CHOICE IN\nTHIS ELECTION AND SO THIS IS WHERE WE'RE SPENDING A LOT OF\nTIME NOW AS WE GET CLOSER TO NOVEMBER 8th.\n>> YOU SAID -- YOU SAID TO ME YOU'RE A MODEST CAMPAIGN WITH A\nMODEST GOAL, SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS MAP, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE\n270 THAT YOU HAVE TO GET, EVEN IF YOU GET UTAH, EVAN, I MEAN\nYOU'RE ONLY GOING TO HAVE SIX ELECTORAL VOTES.\nTHAT'S NOT A PATH TO THE PRESIDENCY.\nWHAT IS YOUR END GAME? >> ACTUALLY, THAT'S NOT\nABSOLUTELY TRUE. IF THE RACE IS CLOSE BETWEEN\nDONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON, AND WE WIN ONE OR TWO\nOR THREE STATES IN THE MOUNTAIN WEST, THEN THAT MEANS WE CAN\nBLOCK THEM BOTH AND TAKE THE ELECTION TO THE HOUSE OF\nREPRESENTATIVES WHERE WE LIKE OUR CHANCES.\nNOW THE TRUTH IS, HILLARY CLINTON IS DOMINATING DONALD\nTRUMP IN MOST PROJECTIONS BY SUCH A LARGE MARGIN, THAT THE\nRACE ISN'T CLOSE RIGHT NOW, BUT YOU KNOW ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IN\nTHIS KIND OF RACE IN THE NEXT TEN DAYS AND WE'LL SEE HOW IT\nDEVELOPS, BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE READY TO BLOCK THEM BOTH IF THE\nRIC RACE IS TIGHT.\nREGARDLESS WE'RE BUILDING A NEW CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT OPEN TO\nALL KINDS OF PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF RACE OR RELIGION.\nWE BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT TO STAND FOR EQUALITY AND TO STAND\nFOR THE CAUSE OF LIBERTY. WE DON'T SEE EITHER DONALD TRUMP\nOR HILLARY CLINTON DOING THAT IN THE WAY WE THINK IT NEEDS TO BE\nDONE OR AT ALL AND SO WE'RE STANDING FOR THAT AND BUILDING\nSOMETHING NEW, WHICH WE THINK IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO PRO VID\nTHE KIND OF LEADERSHIP THIS COUNTRY NEEDS.\n>> SO YOU WANT TO BLOCK BOTH OF THEM AND YOU TAKE IT TO THE\nHOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. I'M WONDERING DO YOU AGREE WITH\nDONALD TRUMP, DO YOU THINK IT IS A RIGGED SYSTEM OR DO YOU THINK\nCHANGES NEED TO BE MADE TO THE SYSTEM?\n>> I DON'T THINK IT'S A RIGGED SYSTEM.\nIF THERE'S ANY RIGGING OF THE SYSTEM AT ALL, IT'S BEEN DONE BY\nVLADIMIR PUTIN, HACKING OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND USING OTHER\nMEANS TO INFLUENCE AND UNDERMINE THE U.S. ELECT PROCESS.\nNO, BUT OTHERWISE I DON'T AGREE IT'S RIGGED.\nI THINK I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE SYSTEM, THE PROCESS OPENED UP A\nBIT. I THINK GIVEN THAT WE HAVE, FROM\nTHE MAJOR PARTIES BOTH HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP, TWO\nCANDIDATES WHO ARE SO HUGELY UNPOPULAR AND I BELIEVE UNFIT\nFOR THE RESPONSIBILITIES THEY SEEK.\nI DO THINK WE NEED NEW VOICES IN THE ELECTION PROCESSES BUT I\nDON'T THINK THAT MEANS THE PROCESS IS RIGGED.\n>> OKAY. I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO MIKE\nPENCE RALLYING VOTERS IN UTAH. HERE HERE IS.\n>> THIS IS OUR CHANCE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.\nI MEAN, THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS, THERE'S ONLY TWO NAMES ON\nTHAT BATTOM TLLOT THAT HAVE A C TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES OF AMERICA, AND WHILE I'LL ALWAYS RESPECT THE RIGHT OF\nANY MAN OR WOMAN TO CAST THEIR VOTE IN THE MANNER THEY SEEM\nBEST, I'VE GOT TO SAY TO YOU FROM MY HEART, I TRULY DO ABOUT\nA VOTE FOR ANY CANDIDATE OTHER THAN DONALD TRUMP IS A VOTE FOR\nA WEAKER AMERICA AT HOME AND ABROAD.\n>> THAT'S HIM WEDNESDAY IN YOUR TERRITORY IN SALT LAKE CITY.\nWHAT'S YOUR REACTION? >> WELL, I WOULD SAY THIS IS\nEXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT US TO BELIEVE.\nBOTH PARTIES WANT US TO BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO CHOOSE EITHER\nDONALD TRUMP OR HILLARY CLINTON. THE TRUTH IS, AMERICANS DON'T\nWANT EITHER ONE OF THEM. WE WANT BETTER CHOICES IN THIS\nCOUNTRY. WE NEED BETTER LEADERS.\nWE NEED WISE AND HONEST LEADERS WHO WILL PUT THE INTEREST OF\nAMERICANS FIRST. IF WE KEEP CHOOSING HILLARY\nCLINTON OR DONALD TRUMP, WE'RE GOING TO KEEP GETTING HILLARY\nCLINTON OR DONALD TRUMP. WE'RE STANDING FOR SOMETHING\nNEW. IT'S TIME FOR A NEW GENERATION\nOF LEADERSHIP IN THIS COUNTRY AND A NEW CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT\nTHAT WILL BE OPEN TO ALL RACES AND RELIGIONS AND UNIFY THIS\nCOUNTRY AND TAKE IT TO A MUCH BRIGHTER FUTURE THAN THINK WE'LL\nHAVE WITH EITHER HILLARY CLINTON OR DONALD TRUMP.\nWE'VE GOT TO START BUILDING THAT NOW IN THIS ELECTION, NOT AFTER\nNOVEMBER 8th WHEN IT -- OTHERS WILL HAVE FAILED TO STAND UP FOR\nWHAT'S GOOD AND TRUE. WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO DO THIS\nNOW AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING.\n>> OKAY. SO I WANT TO READ -- THIS IS A\nTWEET, LOU DOBBS, FIRED OFF AN ANGRY TWEET, LOOK DEEPER, HE'S\nNOTHING BUT A GLOBALIST, ROMNEY, AND MORMON MAFIA TOOL.\n>> I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR HIM DESCRIBE WHAT THE MORMON MAFIA\nIS. IT IS A SORT OF SILLY THING.\nWE'VE BEEN HAVING A LOT OF FUN. A LOT OF PEOPLE ACROSS COUNTRY\nHAVE BEEN HAVING FUN. IN A WAY IT'S NOT SURPRISING.\nDONALD TRUMP AND HIS SUPPORTERS HAVE BEEN ATTACKING PEOPLE BASED\nON RACE AND RELIGION AND GENDER AND THE REALITY IS THIS\nCOUNTRY'S FOR EVERYONE. IN COUNTRTHIS COUNTRY IS FOR AL\nPEOPLE, WITH RELIGIONS OR NO RELIGIONS AT ALL, WITH SKIN LIKE\nMINE OR DIFFERENT, AND WE CANNOT HAVE A PRESIDENT OR MOVEMENT IN\nTHIS COUNTRY AND WE CANNOT TOLERATE IT IF THEY'RE GOING TO\nATTACK US BASED ON WHO WE ARE. WE BELIEVE ALL MEN AND WOMEN ARE\nCREATED EQUAL AND MINDY FIN AND I, MY RUNNING MATE ARE STANDING\nFOR THAT. >> I HAVE TO ASK YOU, HE SAID HE\nCOULD NO LONGER SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP.\nYOU SAY DONALD TRUMP IS LOSING BADLY, BUT UTAH CONGRESSMAN\nJA JASON CHAFFETZ RESCINDED HIS\nTWEET SAYING I WILL NOT DEFEND OR ENDORSE TRUMP BUT I'M VOTING\nFOR HIM. HRC IS THAT BAD.\nHRC IS BAD FOR THE USA. EVEN THOUGH HE TOLD ME ON THE\nDAY THE TAPE CAME OUT HE COULDN'T LOOK HIS 15-YEAR-OLD\nDAUGHTER IN THE EYE AND CONTINUE TO ENDORSE HIM AFTER WHAT HE\nHEARD AND SAW ON THE TAPE, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT REVERSAL?\n>> WELL, DON, I'M JUST DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED BY THAT.\nYOU KNOW, EVENTUALLY, OUR LEADERS HAVE TO START STANDING\nON PRINCIPLE. THEY HAVE TO START STANDING ON\nPRINCIPLE AT THE VERY LEAST WHEN WE'RE BEING ATTACKED.\nWHEN AMERICANS ARE BEING ATTACKED OUR LEADERS NEED TO\nSTAND UP, ESPECIALLY WHEN WOMEN HAVE BEEN ATTACKED IN THIS\nELECTION CYCLE BY DONALD TRUMP, AS CONSISTENTLY AS THEY HAVE\nBEEN. AND BY THE WAY, THAT TAPE, THAT\nWAS NOTHING NEW, THE TRUMP TAPE. HE'S BEEN ATTACKING PEOPLE\nTHROUGH THE ELECTION BASED ON GENDER, RACE, RELIGION F..\nIF OUR LEADERS WILL NOT STAND UP TO THAT OR US WHAT BUSINESS DO\nTHEY HAVE LEADING US, THAT'S MY QUESTION.\n>> EVAN McMULLIN, I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.\nTHANK YOU.",

WE OWN THE FUTURE OF THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY. JOINING US NOW, CHARLES\nKRAUTHAMMER. THIS IS BASICALLY A LOOK AT WHAT\nTHE FUTURE OF DONALD TRUMP AND HIS SUPPORTERS IS, WIN OR LOSE.\nLET'S START WITH WIN. IF HE MANAGES TO WIN ON NOVEMBER\n8th, THIS REPUBLICANISM NOW OFFICIALLY TRUMPISM AND WHAT\nDOES THAT MEAN FOR THE SO-CALLED MAINSTREAM REPUBLICANS LIKE YOU,\nYOU KNOW, LIKE RICH LOWRIE? >> WELL, I THINK IT'S QUITE -- I\nMEAN, IF YOU WIN THE PPRESIDENC, E CERTAINLY YOU RESHAPE OR YOU\nSHAPE YOUR PARTY. THE REPUBLICANS ARE NOT\nCOMPLETELY CONSERVATIVE UNCONFLICTED CONSERVATIVE PARTY.\nBEFORE RONALD REAGAN THEY HAD A STRONG NORTHEAST LIBERAL WING.\nREAGAN COMES IN, THE PARTY HAS BEEN CHANGED IRREVOCABLY.\nIF DONALD TRUMP WINS, HE'S NOT A CONSERVATIVE. HE'S A POPULIST.\nHE WILL HAVE A LITTLE MORE RESISTANCE THAT RONALD REAGAN\nDID. THERE WILL BE RESISTANCE FROM\nTHE OLD REAGAN CONSERVATIVES. BUT IF YOU'RE PRESIDENT,\nESPECIALLY IF YOU SUCCEED IN THE PRESIDENCY, MEANING YOU WIN\nREELECTION OR HAVE STRONG POPULAR SUPPORT LIKE REAGAN DID,\nWU SET DOWN THE RULES FOR A FEW DECADES.\n>>. WHAT IF THE OPPOSITE HAPPENS,\nTRUMP LOSES AND HE STILL HAS SO MUCH INFLUENCE.\nTHIS ARTICLE POINTS OUT HE'S SPENDING $100,000 A WEEK ON DATA\nCOLLECTION FIGURING OUT WHO'S WITH HIM HIM.\nAND THEY'VE DESCRIBED THE AUS AUDIENCE, DISENFRANCHISED\nREPUBLICANS WHO WITH YOUNG, RURAL AND ANGRY, ACTIVE AND\nFIERCELY LOYAL TO DONALD TRUMP. >> REMEMBER TRUMP SAID I COULD\nGO DOWN 5th AVENUE AND SHOOT SOMEBODY AND WOULDN'T LOSE ANY\nSUPPORTERS. THAT'S WHAT HAS HAPPENED,\nTHROUGH THICK AND THIN, THE ACCESS HOLLYWOOD TAPES WHICH\nWOULD HAVE SUNK ANYONE. >> WHAT DO THEY DO WITH THAT\nLOYALTY WHEN HE'S NO LONGER RUNNING FOR OFFICE?\n>> THAT WILL DEPEND ON HIM. HE HAS HIMSELF A PLURALITY OF\nREPUBLICANS. NOT A MAJORITY BUT HE'S GOT A\nSIZABLE CHUNK LARGER THAN ANYBODY ELSE'S.\nTHE QUESTION IS WHAT DOES HE WANT TO DO WITH IT, IS HE GOING\nTO BE GEORGE WAUK AND RIDE AWAY INTO THE SUNSET.\nIF YOU LOSE A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN THE MODERN HISTORY,\nYOU'RE GONE. THERE'S NO MON DALE OR DUKAKIS.\nYOU HAD YOUR CHANCE, YOU DON'T SHOW UP AGAIN.\nTHAT WOULD BE TRUMP. THEY FEEL THEY HAVE NOWHERE ELSE\nTO GO. IF HE DOES NOT WALK AWAY, THEN\nHE CAN DO A LOT WITH THE CONSTITUENCY, PARTICULARLY AS WE\nSAW IN THE BLOOMBERG ARTICLE IF HE HAS THE MECHANICS, THE DATA,\nA WAY TO E-MAIL AND REACH ALL OF THEM AND EVEN IF HE DOESN'T HE\nCAN USE TWITTER OR FACEBOOK. HE CAN SHAPE IT INTO A MOVEMENT\nEITHER TO RUN AGAIN FOR REELECTION TO INFLUENCE THE\nMIDTERM ELECTIONS, TO INFLUENCE THE CURRENT POLITICS.\nIF TRUMP DECIDES TO STAY IN THE GAME, THE FIRST TEST WILL BE\nWHETHER HE CAN SUCCESSFULLY BRING DOWN PAUL RYAN WHO HAS\nBECOME A NEMESIS OF HIS AND THEN WE'LL NOW HOW TRANSITIVE IS HIS\nINFLUENCE. >> RIGHT.\nIF YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED WITH JOHN McCAIN, HE WENT BACK\nTO THE U.S. SENATE. BUT MITT ROMNEY, FOR A WHILE HE\nWAS CONSIDERED A REPUBLICAN LEADER BUB BUT HIS INFLUENCE HAS\nDEFINITELY DIMINISHED. AND THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THE\nSAME THING WOULD HAPPEN TO TRUMP.\nAND YOU'RE SAYING IT'S UP TO TRUMP.\nHE SAYS IF I LOSE, THIS IS ALL FOR NOTHING, A COMPLETE WASTE OF\nTIME AND I'M GOING TO RUN MY SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS AND FOCUS ON\nPROFIT MAKING. IT'S UP TO TRUMP.\nWE'VE SPECULATED ABOUT TRUMP TV, WHETHER HE WANTS TO BUILD A\nMEDIA POWER. WE'RE UNSURE IF HE LOSES THIS\nTHING WHETHER THAT'S SOMETHING HE HAS ANY INTERESTED IN.\n>> BUT WE KNOW ONE THING FROM HIS ENTIRE LIFE HISTORY, HE\nLOVES THE SPOTLIGHT, HE FINDS IT HARD TO BE AWAY FROM IT.\nAND EVEN THOUGH HE SAID AT THE BEGINNING, IF I LOSE I'LL GO\nBACK TO MY OLD LIFE, I DON'T THINK -- HE WILL DECIDE.\nBUT IT IS LIKELY HE'LL BE CHANGED AND HE WILL HAVE\nACQUIRED A POWERFUL INSTRUMENT, A POLITICAL INSTRUMENT.\nHE DIDN'T HAVE THAT BEFORE HE RAN.\nAND HE CAN USE IT, HE COULD USE IT COMMERCIALLY, FOR EXAMPLE,\nWITH A TV STATION OR A TV NETWORK OR SOME OTHER USE IN THE\nMEDIA OR HE CAN DO IT POLITICALLY IN WHICH CASE HE\nMOBILIZES HIS PEOPLE TO INFLUENCE ELECTIONS AND PERHAPS\nHIS OWN LATER ON. IT'S EXTREMELY TEMPTING BECAUSE\nHE BUILT THIS ESSENTIALLY ON HIS OWN AND OUT OF NOWHERE AND HE'S\nGOT A LOT OF OPTIONS. HE'S NOT THE RETIRING TYPE, YOU\nMIGHT HAVE NOTICED. >> WELL EVEN IF TRUMP DOESN'T\nWIN ON NOVEMBER 8th, HE HAS ACTED AS A VOICE FOR A LARGE,\nYOU KNOW, LARGE NUMBER OS F PEOPLE WHO FEEL DISENFRANCHISED\nAND WE'LL SEE WHETHER TRUMP CONTINUES TO USE THAT POWER\nGIVING THEM A VOICE. HE WOULD MUCH RATHER DO IT FROM\nTHE OVAL OFFICE AND HE MAY YET DO THAT TOO.\n>> WE'LL SEE IF THE SO-CALLED ESTABLISHMENT IS ABLE TO\nRECOGNIZE THE POWER AND THE NEEDS OF THAT CONSTITUENCY AND\nTO KALT ITS POLICY TO ACCOMMODATE THEM.\nTHAT WOULD GO A LONG WAY AS WELL IN DETERMINING HOW THE\nCONSTITUENCY IS RESPONDED TO. >> GREAT TO SEE YOU.\nTHANK YOU.",

AND THE RNC CAME BEARING GIFTS\nFOR ITS NOMINEE THIS YEAR. IT HAPPENS THAT IT'S DONALD\nTRUMP. >> TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER\nKELLYANNE CONWAY TALKING ABOUT THE GREAT RELATIONSHIP THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN HAS WITH THE RNC. THE RNC CAME BEARING GIFTS FOR\nTHE CAMPAIGN THIS YEAR. PARTIES AND THEIR PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATES ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE GOOD RELATIONSHIPS.\nTHAT'S PART OF THE DEAL. THAT'S USUALLY AT LEAST IDEALLY\nHOW IT WORKS. BUT THAT RELATIONSHIP, THAT\nCOORDINATION AND THE EXTENT OF THAT COORDINATION IS SOMETHING\nTHAT IS NOW MATERIALLY IMPORTANT TO THE BREAKING NEWS THAT WE\nREPORTED HERE LAST NIGHT AFTER THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY LAST NIGHT\nFILED PAPERS IN FEDERAL COURT IN NEW JERSEY ASKING THAT COURT TO\nHOLD THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN VIOLATION OF AN ANCIENT CONSENT\nDECREE THAT DATES BACK TO THE 1980s.\nIT DATES BACK TO AN ELECTION IN WHICH THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN\nPARTY SENT BASICALLY VIGILANTE POLL WATCHERS INTO MINORITY PRECINCTS IN 1981.\nMANY OF THEM WORE GUNS, THEY WORE THESE BALLOT SECURITY TASK\nFORCE ARM BANDS AND THEY PATROLLED VOTING SITES IN DOZENS\nOF PRECINCTS THAT HAD MOSTLY MINORITY VOTERS.\nAND THE REPUBLICANS DID VERY, VERY, VERY NARROWLY WIN THAT\nGOVERNOR'S RACE IN NEW JERSEY THAT YEAR.\nBUT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY SUED OVER THIS BALLOT SECURITY TASK\nFORCE THING. AND THE DEMOCRATS WON THAT CASE.\nAND THE REPUBLICANS SIGNED ON TO A CONSENT DECREE BECAUSE OF IT.\nAND NOW, 35 YEARS LATER, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS STILL TRYING\nTO GET OUT FROM UNDER THE LEGAL RESTRICTIONS THAT WERE PUT ON\nTHEM BECAUSE OF THAT CASE. AND IN THE MIDST OF THAT, HERE'S\nWHAT DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN SAYING OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN\nTRAIL. >> WE HAVE A LOT OF LAW\nENFORCEMENT PEOPLE WORKING THAT DAY.\nWE'RE HIRING A LOT OF PEOPLE. WE'RE PUTTING A LOT OF LAW\nENFORCEMENT. WE HAVE SOME GREAT PEOPLE HERE,\nSOME GREAT LEADERS HERE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, AND THEY'RE\nVERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. AND THAT'S THE WAY WE COULD LOSE\nTHE STATE. >> SO IMPORTANT THAT YOU WATCH\nOTHER COMMUNITIES, BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THIS ELECTION STOLEN\nFROM US. >> WHEN I SAY WATCH, YOU KNOW\nWHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, RIGHT? YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.\n>> YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.\nWE'RE GOING TO HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT DOING THIS.\nWE DON'T WANT THIS ELECTION STOLEN FROM US.\nWE HAVE SOME GREAT LEADERS OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\nDONALD TRUMP IS NOT UNDER A CONSENT DECREE THAT DATES BACK\nTO THE 1980s ON THIS SUBJECT. THE RNC IS UNDER A CONSENT\nDECREE THAT DATES BACK TO THE 1980s ON THIS SUBJECT.\nI MEAN TECHNICALLY DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF CAN GO OUT AND TALK\nABOUT ALL OF THIS STUFF, BUT THE RNC UNDER THIS CONSENT DECREE,\nTHEY CAN'T TAKE PART IN ANY OF IT.\nIT HAS TO BE CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT THERE'S NO WORKING TOGETHER HERE\nBETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND THE RNC ON ISSUES OF BALLOT\nINTEGRITY AND POLL WATCHING ON ELECTION DAY, PARTICULARLY WHEN\nTHOSE EFFORTS TARGET MINORITY DISTRICTS.\nIF THERE IS COORDINATION, THAT MAY BE A PROBLEM.\nTHE DEMOCRATIC PARTY NOW ARGUES THAT WOULD BE A VIOLATION OF\nTHAT CONSENT DECREE. >> I FINALLY PULLED ASIDE\nKELLYANNE CONWAY AND SAID WHAT IS THE CAMPAIGN GOING TO DO.\nIS THIS THE CENTRAL STRATEGY TO CONTEST THE ELECTION.\nSHE SAID SHE'S ACTIVELY WORKING WITH THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL\nCOMMITTEE, THE OFFICIAL PARTY AND CAMPAIGN LAWYERS TO MONITOR\nPRECINCTS AROUND THE COUNTRY. SO THIS ISN'T JUST AN OUTSIDE\nCAMPAIGN AND OUTSIDE CANDIDATE. HE'S TYING HIMSELF TO THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY WITH HIM. >> IT'S A TREMENDOUS QUESTION\nAND I WILL TELL YOU THAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND THE\nREPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE ARE WORKING VERY, VERY CLOSELY\nWITH STATE GOVERNMENTS AND SECRETARY OF STATE OF STATES ALL\nOVER THE COUNTRY TO ENSURE BALLOT INTEGRITY.\n>> WORKING VERY, VERY, VERY, CLOSELY.\nI SHOULD SAY YOU JUST SAW ROBERT COSTA REPORTING WHAT HE HAD\nHEARD FROM KELLYANNE CONWAY SAYING THAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN\nIS ACTIVELY WORKING WITH THE RNC TO MONITOR PRECINCTS AROUND THE\nCOUNTRY. AFTER KELLYANNE CONWAY TOLD\nROBERT COSTA THAT AND HE REPORTED IT HERE ON MSNBC,\nKELLYANNE CONWAY WALKED THAT STATEMENT BACK AND THE RNC IS\nAGGRESSIVELY DENYING THIS COORDINATION.\nBUT HOW ABOUT MIKE PENCE SAYING, RIGHT, THAT THIS BALLOT\nINTEGRITY IS A TREMENDOUS QUESTION THIS YEAR AND THE RNC,\nTHE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE, IS WORKING VERY, VERY\nCLOSELY WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN TO ENSURE BALLOT INTEGRITY.\nHOW ABOUT THAT? HE DIDN'T WALK THAT BACK.\nPART OF THE DNC FILING FROM LAST NIGHT ALLEGES THAT THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY AND THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN ARE SHARING STAFF,\nTHEY'RE SHARING RESOURCES, THEY'RE COORDINATING THESE\nTHINGS. THERE'S SO MUCH COORDINATION\nTHAT THERE ARE NO LINES DELINEATING WHERE ONE STARTS AND\nANOTHER ENDS. THE RNC, ACCORDING TO THIS\nCOMPLAINT, QUOTE, COMMINGLED ITS STAFF AND RESOURCES WITH THE\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN AND SO IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEPARATE THE TWO.\nTHAT'S WHAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS ALLEGING.\nARGUABLY, THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE ASKING THE COURT TO DETERMINE.\nTHAT'S THE CRUX OF THIS WHOLE THING.\nWHEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN PROMISES IT'S GOING TO DO THIS IN THESE\nCITIES, AS TRUMP SAYS, INNER CITIES IN SWING STATES, IS HE\nTALKING ABOUT DOING THAT ALONE OR IS THE RNC INVOLVED?\nLET ME LEAVE YOU WITH ONE MORE THING THAT SEEMS RELEVANT HERE.\nTHIS IS THE HEAD OF THE RNC, REINCE PRIEBUS, SPEAKING ON\nSUNDAY. >> I DON'T MEAN HIS RESPONSE TO\nTHE DEBATE, JUST IN GENERAL WHEN HE GOES OUT AND SAYS THE\nELECTION IS RIGGED, HE SAID IT LAST NIGHT.\n>> I THINK HE'S TRYING TO ALSO TELL HIS FOLKS TO WATCH OUT FOR\nTHIS FRAUD THAT MIGHT OCCUR. >> HE'S TRYING TO TELL HIS FOLKS\nTO WATCH OUT FOR THIS FRAUD THAT MIGHT OCCUR, SAYS THE HEAD OF\nTHE RNC. ON ONE HAND REINCE PRIEBUS IS\nDECODING DONALD TRUMP THERE ON CBS THIS WEEKEND.\nON THE OTHER HAND, I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE RNC AND THIS\nTHREAT TO RIG THE ELECTION AND THIS FRAUD THAT MIGHT OCCUR AND\nWHETHER THE RNC IS WORKING ON THIS.\nTELL ME MORE, MR. HEAD OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\nOH, YOU'RE NOT HERE. LET'S INSTEAD ASK BEN GINSBURG,\nFORMER GENERAL COUNSEL AND AN MSNBC ANALYST.\nI AM NOT ASKING YOU TO BE REINCE PRIEBUS OR TO DEFEND REINCE\nPRIEBUS. >> I APPRECIATE THAT.\n>> BUT I DO WANT YOU TO GIVE ME YOUR VIEW ON WHAT'S GOING ON\nRIGHT NOW WITH THIS COMPLAINT. YOU'RE THE MAN WHO SAID THAT YOU\nCOULD BASICALLY GUARANTEE THAT THE DEMOCRATS WERE GOING TO MAKE\nTHIS COURT FILING ONCE YOU SAW WHAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WAS\nTALKING ABOUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\n>> YEAH, AND WHAT I ADDED TO THAT AND WHAT I SORT OF SAID\nDIRECTLY LATER IN THE EVENING WAS THAT IN FACT THAT ACTIVITY\nWAS NOT TAKING PLACE BECAUSE -- WELL, I DON'T WANT THE RNC, BUT\nI DO KNOW THAT THE RNC TAKES THE CONSENT DECREE VERY SERIOUSLY.\nWHAT YOU HAVE IS SOME BAD RHETORIC, BUT NOT THE ACTIONS.\nSO THE WHOLE CONSENT DECREE ITSELF AND THE SORT OF MUSCLING\nUP IN POLLING PLACES HAS BEEN A BLACK MARK ON THE REPUBLICAN\nPARTY. THAT HAS HARMED IT NOT ONLY\nREPUTATIONALY, WHICH IS WHY THE DEMOCRATS OR PURSUING THIS\nCONSENT DECREE, BUT ALSO REALLY POLITICALLY.\nAND SO ALL IN ALL, THIS IS A MOMENT THAT THE REPUBLICAN\nNATIONAL COMMITTEE WANTS TO GET BEYOND SO THAT IT CAN ENGAGE\nWITH ITS STATE PARTIES IN THE PERMISSIBLE LOOKING AT THE\nELECTIONS. AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF BEING\nSURE THAT THE VOTERS UNDERSTAND THAT THE ELECTION IS FAIR AND IS\nNOT RIGGED AND THE PRACTICES IN THE POLLING PLACES ARE BEING\nCONDUCTED CORRECTLY. >> THAT'S PART OF THIS THAT I'VE\nBEEN TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON. I'M GLAD TO HEAR YOU EXPLAIN IT\nTHAT WAY, BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND WHAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY\nGOT NAILED FOR IN THE '80s WAS COMIC BOOK EGREGIOUS, BUT I\nHAVEN'T REALLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT -- I'M ASSUMING THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY DOESN'T WANT TO DO THE ARM BANDS AND OFF-DUTY\nGUNS, I'M ASSUMING, ALTHOUGH WE COULD -- NO, WE WON'T MAKE THAT\nARGUMENT. LET'S ASSUME THAT THE REPUBLICAN\nPARTY DOESN'T. WHAT DOES THE REPUBLICAN PARTY\nWANT TO DO THAT'S NOT RACIST, THAT'S NOT EGREGIOUS, THAT'S NOT\nSUPPRESSIVE, THAT THEY'RE PROHIBITED FROM DOING BY THIS\nCONSENT DECREE? WHY DO THEY FEEL SO CONSTRAINED?\n>> EVERY STATE, EVERY STATE ALLOWS REPRESENTATIVES OF THE\nPOLITICAL PARTIES OR CAMPAIGNS OR A COMBINATION OF THE TWO TO\nOBSERVE WHAT GOES ON IN THE POLLING PLACE.\nTHAT IS A MATTER OF BEING ABLE TO ENSURE THE FAIRNESS OF\nELECTIONS. AS A NATIONAL PARTY COMMITTEE,\nIT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE TO\nPARTICIPATE IN THOSE PERMISSIBLE, LAWFUL ACTIVITIES\nJUST AS THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE DOES NOW.\n>> AND THE DNC CAN DO THAT NOW AND THE RNC BECAUSE OF THAT\nCONSENT DECREE, THEY CAN'T. >> CORRECT.\n>> SO WHEN YOU SAY THAT THE RNC IS NOT DOING ANYTHING THAT MIGHT\nVIOLATE THAT CONSENT DECREE, THEY'RE NOT DOING ANY OF THIS\nPOLL WATCHING STUFF, THEY'RE NOT WORKING ON IT, THEY CAN'T BE --\n>> THEY CAN GIVE ADVICE TO THE STATE PARTIES, THEY TELL THEIR\nPERSONNEL. I BELIEVE THERE WAS A MEMO THAT\nWENT OUT TO ALL THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TELLING THEM --\n>> DON'T DO IT PERSONALLY. >> YEAH, DON'T DO IT PERSONALLY,\nRIGHT. >> SO WHAT ABOUT MIKE PENCE\nSAYING WE'RE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE RNC ON BALLOT INTEGRITY ISSUES AND MAKING SURE\nTHIS ISN'T STOLEN. >> I CAN'T SPEAK FOR HIM.\nI DO KNOW HE MADE THAT STATEMENT IN AUGUST AND WE'RE NOW IN\nOCTOBER AND NONE OF THOSE ACTIVITIES OF THE REPUBLICAN\nNATIONAL COMMITTEE PERSONNEL WORKING IN THE POLLING PLACE,\nACTIVITIES HAS TAKEN PLACE AS FAR AS I KNOW OR AS FAR AS THE\nDEMOCRATS COULD SAY. >> WHAT ABOUT THE RNC STAFF\nWORKING BASICALLY IN-HOUSE AT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN NOW.\nYOU KNOW, RNC LIKE SEAN SPICER HAS BEEN WORKING BASICALLY\nIN-HOUSE WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.\nIF ONE OF THE THINGS THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS DOING IS GETTING\nPEOPLE TO SIGN UP TO GO BE POLL WATCHERS, DOES THAT MEAN THAT\nTHE RNC WITH HAVING THEIR STAFF INSIDE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, THAT\nTHEY'RE IN EFFECT PARTICIPATING IN IT?\n>> NO, BECAUSE I THINK THE WAY THEY'RE WORKING IT IS THAT\nYOU'VE GOT A SORT OF A UNIT, THE FIELD PEOPLE, TRYING TO GET\nPEOPLE IN PLACE TO BE ABLE TO OBSERVE AS THEY'RE ALLOWED TO\nUNDER STATE LAWS. I THINK THE RNC PERSONNEL THE R\nAT LEAST BEEN GIVEN INSTRUCTIONS TO NOT PARTICIPATE IN THOSE\nACTIVITIES. >> IF YOU WERE THERE RUNNING THE\nSHOW AT THE RNC, I WOULD KNOW THAT THEY HAD BEENGIVEN THOSE\nINSTRUCTIONS. HEARING MIKE PENCE TALK ABOUT\nTHIS ON NATIONAL TV MAKES ME THINK THAT THEY ARE NOT BEING AS\nCAREFUL ABOUT IT. >> RIENCE CAN SPEAK FOR HIMSELF,\nBUT WHAT IS 100% TRUE IS THAT THE DEMOCRATS DO NOT CITE IN\nTHEIR SHOW CAUSE ORDER ANY ACTUAL ACTIVITIES BY ANY RNC\nPERSONNEL. SO THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN\nOVERHEATED POLITICAL RHETORIC AND THE ACTUAL ACTIVITIES.\n>> DO WE HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL ELECTION DAY TO SEE THOSE\nACTIVITIES? >> NO, I DON'T THINK SO.\nTHERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE VOTING NOW, DOING EARLY VOTING,\nABSENTEE VOTERS OBSERVERS FROM BOTH PARTIES, AND THAT HELPS\nVALIDATE THE PROCESS. >> BEN GINSBERG, THANK YOU.\nI REALIZE IT'S A LITTLE LIKE, IT'S A LITTLE TECHNICAL, BUT THE\nSTORIES BEHIND IT AND THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT'S BEHIND IT\nGIVES THIS SO MUCH HEAT AND ENERGY, WE HAVE ALREADY HEARD\nTHAT THEY'VE ASKED, THE JUDGE HAS ASKED FOR THIS TO MOVE\nREALLY FAST. THEY'VE ASKED FOR THE PARTIES TO\nBE IN COURT ON WEDNESDAY MORNING.\n>> THERE'S A LONG TRADITION OF BEING IN THE FEDERAL DISTRICT\nCOURT NOWHERE CLOSE TO THE ",

THAT'S RIGHT.\nHILLARY DOESN'T PLAY. >> HILLARY DOESN'T PLAY.\nTHAT WAS HILLARY CLINTON AND MICHELLE OBAMA TODAY IN\nWINSTON-SALEM, NORTH CAROLINA. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THEY HAVE\nDONE A JOINT CAMPAIGN APPEARANCE.\nAND, AS THAT WAS KIND OF, WE PLAYED THAT BIT THERE TO GIVE\nYOU A SENSE OF THE VIBE THERE. I THINK BASICALLY TAKING TURNS\nHEAPING PRAISE ON ONE ANOTHER, AND THIS EVENT WAS ONE OF\nHILLARY CLINTON'S BIGGEST EVENTS OF THE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN.\nTHERE WERE APPARENTLY 14,000 PEOPLE THERE AT THIS NORTH\nCAROLINA RALLY TODAY. AND THIS WAS A GOOD ONE TO\nCHOOSE TO BE A BIG ONE, BECAUSE MICHELLE OBAMA WAS THERE.\nONE OF THE MOST BELOVED FIGURES IN POLITICS RIGHT NOW.\nONE OF THE MOST POPULAR FIGURES IN POLITICS, CERTAINLY AMONG\nDEMOCRATS, PARTICULARLY AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICAN DEMOCRATS, AND\nA ABSOLUTELY KEY CONSTITUENCY. THIS MAY HAVE BEEN ONE OF\nHILLARY CLINTON'S MOST IMPORTANT APPEARANCES TODAY.\nAND IT WAS WARM. AND HILLARY CLINTON WAS AT HER\nBEST, AND IT WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE THINGS SHE\nHAS DONE. BUT.\nWHAT MIGHT BE MOST IMPORTANT HERE IS WE GOT AN ANSWER TO A\nQUESTION THAT HAS BEEN FLOATING AROUND THE OBAMA FAMILY'S\nPENDING DEPARTURE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.\nNOW THIS HAS NOT BEEN COVERED WIDELY TODAY.\nMAYBE EVERYBODY ELSE DOESN'T SEE THIS AS THE BIGGEST DEAL OF THE\nWORLD. I REALIZE THAT THE FATE OF THE\nFREE WORLD DOES NOT RELY ON THIS QUESTION.\nBUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S A STRESSFUL TIME.\nIN THIS MOST STRESSFUL OF ELECTIONS, WE HERE AT THE SHOW\nAND WE IN MY FAMILY HAVE BEEN CHEWING ON OUR FINGERNAILS A\nLITTLE BIT, WONDERING WITH A LITTLE BIT OF ACTUAL STRESS\nWHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE WHITE HOUSE VEGETABLE GARDEN.\nWHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO IT? THE KITCHEN GARDEN PLANTED BY\nFIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA. THIS HAS BEEN A PASSION OF HER\nTIME IN THE WHITE HOUSE, FOR ALMOST THE ENTIRE TIME SHE'S\nBEEN THERE, SHE'S BEEN BUILDING IT UP, MAINTAINING IT AND\nSHOWING IT OFF. RECENTLY, EXPANDING IT.\nAND DIFFERENT PRESIDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES DO DIFFERENT\nTHINGS TO THE WHITE HOUSE, THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES THAT THE NEXT\nOCCUPANTS WILL KEEP ANYTHING THAT THE LAST OCCUPANTS OF THE\nWHITE HOUSE DID TO THE GROUNDS. THE NEW PRESIDENT WOULD BE\nABSOLUTELY FREE TO PLOW THE VEGETABLE GARDEN UNDER, IF THEY\nLIKE, RIGHT? JIMMY CARTER, YOU WANT TO PUT\nSOLAR PANELS ON THE WHITE HOUSE, RONALD REAGAN WANTS TO TAKE THEM\nDOWN. REALLY EXPECT MELANIA TRUMP OR\nBILL CLINTON TO BE OUT THERE TENDING TO THE TURNIPS AND\nHARVESTING THE OKRA? REALLY?\nARE THEY GOING TO KEEP IT? AS HER TIME GROWS SHORT,\nMICHELLE OBAMA HAS HARDENED THE GARDEN'S DEFENSES.\nSHE UNVEILED AN EXPANDED GARDEN NOW TWICE ITS ORIGINAL SIZE AND\nIT'S GOT HARD PARTS. STONE WALKWAYS AND PLANTERS MADE\nFROM CONCRETE AND STEEL AND PICNIC TABLES AND STUFF.\nFIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA ANNOUNCED A MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR\nGRANT FOR MAINTAINING IT. SO IT WON'T BE AN EXCUSE IF THEY\nWANTED TO GET RID OF THE GARDEN FOR THAT REASON.\nNOT INCIDENTALLY, MICHELLE OBAMA PLANTED A COUPLE OF CROPS THAT\nARE IN THE GROUND NOW THAT WON'T BE READY FOR HARVEST UNTIL THE\nSPRING, WHEN THERE'S A NEW PRESIDENT.\nWHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? WASTE THAT FOOD?\nSO IT'S BEEN A DISCUSSION. WILL THE NEXT PRESIDENT KEEP THE\nGARDEN OR PUT UP A PARKING LOT? TODAY WE GOT AN ANSWER.\nAT LEAST IF HILLARY CLINTON WINS.\n>> NOW SHE ALSO PLANTED AN AMAZING VEGETABLE GARDEN AT THE\nWHITE HOUSE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]\nAND I CAN PROMISE YOU, IF I WIN, I WILL TAKE GOOD CARE OF IT,\nMICHELLE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]\n>> IF HILLARY CLINTON WINS THE ELECTION, THE GARDEN LIVES!\nLOOK HOW HAPPY THAT MAKES MICHELLE OBAMA.\nI DON'T RLLY TOTALLY UNDERSTAND WHY I'M SO ATTACHED\nTO THIS VEGETABLE GARDEN, BEYOND THE OBVIOUS REASONS THAT I AM A\nCARD-CARRYING MEMBER OF THE LIBERAL VEGETABLE LOBBY.\nBUT IF THERE IS A STEADY STREAM OF IMAGES IN BILL CLINTON\nTILLING THE SOIL, DEADHEADING STUFF, THAT WOULD BE A LEGACY TO\nCELEBRATE.

IT WAS LOCKER ROOM TALK.\nTHE MICROPHONE WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ON, NOT THAT I MAKE THAT\nAS AN EXCUSE FOR MYSELF, BUT CERTAINLY, IT WAS AN ILLEGAL ACT\nTHAT WAS NBC. IT WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ON.\n>> DO YOU THINK IT WAS ILLEGAL WHAT THEY DID, PUTTING THAT TAPE\nOUT? >> OH, ABSOLUTELY.\nTHAT WAS A PRIVATE LOCKER, THAT WAS A PRIVATE DRESSING ROOM.\n>> ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE ANY ACTION AFTER THE ELECTION\nAGAINST NBC?

THE CAMPAIGN SAYS ONLY THE\nPEOPLE WE WANT TO SEE IT, SEE IT.\nIN HER FIRST CAMPAIGN APPEARANCE WITH HILLARY CLINTON TODAY,\nMICHELLE OBAMA FOCUSSED ON THE TRUMP VOTER SUPPRESSION\nSTRATEGY. >> THAT'S THE STRATEGY, TO MAKE\nTHIS ELECTION SO DIRTY AND UGLY THAT WE DON'T WANT ANY PART OF\nIT, SO WHEN YOU HEAR FOLKS TALKING ABOUT A GLOBAL\nCONSPIRACY AND SAYING THAT THIS ELECTION IS RIGGED, UNDERSTAND\nTHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO GET YOU TO STAY HOME.\nTHEY ARE TRYING TO CONVINCE YOU THAT YOUR VOTE DOESN'T MATTER,\nTHAT THE OUTCOME HAS ALREADY BEEN DETERMINED, AND YOU\nSHOULDN'T EVEN BOTHER MAKING YOUR VOICE HEARD.\nTHEY ARE TRYING TO TAKE AWAY YOUR HOPE.\nAND JUST FOR THE RECORD, IN THIS COUNTRY, THE UNITED STATES OF\nAMERICA, THE VOTERS DECIDE OUR ELECTIONS.\nTHEY'VE ALWAYS DECIDED.

THE ONLY WAY TO GET HIS GUY\nELECTED WAS TO MAKE THE OTHER GUY A COMPLETE MESS, AND IT\nWORKED. AND AFTER 1984, IT HAS BEEN PART\nOF THE DARK ARTS. AND IT'S DISGRACEFUL.\nAND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GOING TO WORK THIS YEAR.\nI SUSPECT IT WON'T. >> BUT VOTER SUPPRESSION IS\nSOMETHING DARKER THAN THAT, PREVENTING PEOPLE FROM GETTING\nTO THE POLLS, PREVENTING THEM FROM BEING RECOGNIZED AS\nLEGITIMATE VOTERS. THERE'S A LOT OF SUSPICION THAT\nREPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN UP TO THAT.\n>> AND IF TRUE, DISGUSTING AND APPALLING.\nI WILL TELL YOU WHAT THE BIGGER PIECE OF NEWS IN THAT BLOOMBERG\nPIECE IS, WHICH IS THAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS DOING A LOT\nMORE POLLING AND DATA ANALYTICS THAN ANYBODY THOUGHT AND THEY\nKNOW THEY'RE LOSING, SO WHEN HE SAYS THESE THINGS ABOUT HOW HE\nDOESN'T BELIEVE THE POLLS, HIS PEOPLE LOOKING AT THE POLLS, WE\nKNOW THAT WE'RE LOSING THIS CAMPAIGN AND THAT IT'S BASICALLY\nOVER.

IN ONE EMAIL BAND \"YELLED AND\nSCREAMED AT MY DAD.\" LATER REACTING TO NEWS REPORTS\nEXAMINING THE FINANCES HE E-MAILED \"I HOPE SOMEONE IS\nKEEPING TABS ON DUG BANNED.\" >> THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN THATS A\nMATTER OF POLICY HAS NOT RESPONDED TO INDIVIDUAL EMAILS.\nTHEY'VE SAID YOU CANNOT GUARANTEE THE AUTHENTICITY OF\nTHE EMAILS. ON THIS ISSUE THEY RELEASED A\nSTATEMENT SAYING FOLLOWING THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAS MADE CLEAR\nTHAT HILLARY CLINTON'S ACTION WERE MADE IN THE BEST OF\nAMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY AND NEVER MADE OF DECISIONS BECAUSE\nOF DONATIONS TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nIN THAT STATEMENT THEY ALSO TAKE A DIG AT DONALD TRUMP SAYING\nHE'S NOT GRANTED IN PUBLIC RUSSIA IS BEHIND THE HACKS.\n>> JIM SCIUTTO, THANKS.

WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THE\nEMAILS AS THEY EMERGED CHELSEA CLINTON APPARENTLY GOT INVOLVED\nIN THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, WAS UNHAPPY WITH THE WAY THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION WAS BEING RUN AND SOME OF WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE\nLAST FEW DAYS SEEMS TO BE A RESPONSE FROM DOUG BAND AROUND\nBILL CLINTON AND THE CLINTON FOUNDATION IN DEFENDING HIS ROLE\nAND HIS CONTRIBUTION.

I DON'T KNOW ANY PRESIDENT OF\nTHE YOU STATE HAS A PROBLEM GETTING SPEAKING ENGAMEMENTS FOR\nFAIRLY EYE-POPPING AMOUNTS OF MONEY AND BILL CLINTON IS NOT\nANY MEAN SPEAKER.

YOU KNOW, WE KEEP TALKING, NOT\nWE BUT PEOPLE TALK AS IF NOVEMBER 8th IS THE DAY THE\nELECTION IS DECIDED, BUT 40% OF THE VOTE WILL HAVE BEEN CAST BY\nTHAT TIME.

HERE IS THE PART THEY WANT TO\nSHARE. WATCH.\n>> WHETHER TRUMP MEANS IT OR NOT IS KIND OF IRRELEVANT BECAUSE\nSHE'S SAYING THE THINGS TO PEOPLE WHO ARE HURTING.\nAND IT'S WHY EVERY BEATEN DOWN NAMELESS FORGOTTEN WORKING STIFF\nWHO USED TO BE PART OF WHAT WAS CALLED THE MIDDLE CLASS LOVES\nTRUMP. HE IS THE HUMAN MOLOTOV COCKTAIL\nTHAT THEY'VE BEEN WAITING FOR.

HE DEFENDED TRUMP SUPPORTERS WHO\nHE ONCE CALLED LEGAL TERRORISTS. MICHAEL MOORE IS NOT A TRUMP FAN\nBUT HE MAKES A COMPELLING CASE ABOUT WHY SOME PEOPLE ARE.\nWATCH. >> CORPORATE AMERICA HATES\nTRUMP. WALL STREET HATES TRUMP.\nTHE CAREER POLITICIANS HATE TRUMP.\nTHE MEDIA HATES TRUMP. YES ON NOVEMBER 8th YOU JOE\nBLOW, STEVE BLOW, BOB BLOW, BILLY BLOW, BILLY BOB BLOW, ALL\nOF THE BLOWS GET TO GO AND BLOW UP THE WHOLE GOD DAMN SYSTEM\nBECAUSE IT'S YOUR RIGHT.

BUT THIS IS WITHOUT CONTEXT AS\nMICHAEL MOORE POINTS OUN TWITTER SAYING HEY, EVERYONE, DONALD\nTRUMP JR. AND THE RIGHT WING THINKS MY MOVIE IS PRO-TRUMP.\nHA HA. PLEASE DON'T TELL THEM\nOTHERWISE. THEY'VE DOCTORED CLIPS FROM MY\nFILM TO MAKE IT LOOK PRO-TRUMP. FOR THE RECORD, THE VIRAL CLIP\nWASN'T DOCTORED. IT SIMPLY LEFT OFF THIS PART.\nWATCH THIS PART. >> LIKE THE BRITS WHO WANTED TO\nSEND A MESSAGE SO THEY VOTED TO LEAVE EUROPE ONLY TO FIND OUT\nTHAT IF YOU VOTE TO LEAVE EUROPE YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO LEAVE\nEUROPE. AND NOW THEY REGRET IT.\nALL THE OHIOANS, PENNSYLVANIANS, MICHIGANDERS AND WIS KONS NIETS,\nTHEY ALL VOTED TO LEAVE AND NOW THEY REGRET IT.\n>> NO QUESTION WITH THIS TROLLING MICHAEL MOORE GOT\nSUPPORT FOR HIS FILM. BIG QUESTION OF WHETHER HE\nGEMMED UP SUPPORT FOR DONALD TRUMP.\n>> WITH US NOW, MICHAEL MOORE. GREAT TO SEE YOU.\n>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON. >> THE REAL ZINGER AT THE END OF\nTHE CLIP YOU SAY EVERYBODY WHEN THEY VOTE FOR TRUMP, THEY'RE\nGOING TO FIND OUT THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WASN'T GOING TO BE A\nDEMOCRAT THING FOR THEM. IT WILL BE TOO LATE TO DO\nANYTHING ABOUT IT. GOOD NIGHT MEERK.\nYOU'VE JUST ELECTED THE LAST PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nWHAT DOES THAT MEAN? >> THAT MEANS THAT -- WELL,\nFIRST OF ALL WHEN I SAY DOCTORED, THEY CUT ME OFF AFTER\nI SAID IT WILL FEEL GOOD AFTER YOU VOTE FOR HIM, THE NEXT LINE\nIS FOR A DAY OR FOR A WEEK. WHEN YOU FIND OUT YOUR LIFE\nISN'T GOING TO GET ANY BETTER UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP AND WILL\nPROBABLY GET WORSE, THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO FIND OUT.\n>> THAT'S THE WIND UP TO THE HIT THAT YOU'RE BEING DUPED.\n>> YEAH. >> WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE'S GOING\nTO BE THE LAST PRESIDENT?

YOU APPEAL TO THEM TIME AND TIME\nAGAIN. YOU OUTLINE PERFECTLY WHY\nTHEY'RE ATTRACTED TO HIM. THEY WANT HIM TO BLOW THINGS UP.\nH'S A HUMAN MOLOTOV COCKTAIL. >> I'M HERE ON FOX TO APPEAL TO\nPEOPLE WHO ARE WATCHING TO NOT DO THAT.\nI UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE ANGRY. YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE\nANGRY. THE SYSTEM HAS FAILED YOU.\nBUT HE IS NOT THE SOLUTION TO THIS.\nAND I MAKE THE CASE IN THE FILM -- THE FILM IS A HUMOROUS\nLOVE POEM TO HILLARY CLINTON. >> I CAN HEAR THE TICKET SALES\nNOW. >> IT'S BEEN NUMBER ONE ON\niTUNES SINCE FRIDAY. >> THANKS TO TRUMP.\n>> IT WAS NUMBER ONE UNTIL \"THE WALKING DEAD\" TOOK OVER.\nIF HE HAD WATCHED THE WHOLE MOVIE, HE AND DON JR.

SAYS MICHAEL MOORE GETS THIS ONE 100% RIGHT.\n>> OBVIOUSLY HE DIDN'T WATCH THE MOVIE BECAUSE IT TELLS\nEVERYBODY -- >> HE'S A BUSY MAN.\nYOU SPEAK ABOUT THE PEOPLE IN OHIO, IN MICHIGAN, PENNSYLVANIA\nAND WISCONSIN. YOU TALK AT HOW THEY LOST THEIR\nJOBS, THEIR HOMES, THEY HAD A DIVORCE, NOW THE WIFE AND KIDS\nARE GONE, THE CAR HAS BEEN REPOED, THEY CAN'T GET AN F'n\nPERCOCET. THEY WANT CHANGE AND THEY DON'T\nSEE IT IN HILLARY CLINTON. >> THEY SHOULD.\nSHE WILL MAKE THIS BETTER. SHE'S THE PROPONENT OF UNIVERSAL\nHEALTH CARE, BEEN THAT WAY FOR 20 YEARS.\nOBAMACARE WILL GET BETTER UNDER HER.\nTHE REAL PROBLEM ABOUT OBAMACARE IS NOT THE OBAMA PART.\nTHE PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE CALLING THE SHOTS.\nTHEY GET THE RAISE THE RATES. THERE'S NO CONTROL.\nOBAMACARE WAS ONLY A HALFWAY MEASURE.\nWE'LL GET THE REST OF IT UNDER HILLARY CLINTON.\nSHE'S GO TO DO SO MANY THING, RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE, SHE'S\nGOING TO DO THINGS THAT WILL HELP EQUALITY FOR WOMEN.\n>> YOU LIKE HER SO MUCH. WHY WERE YOU AGAINST HER WHEN\nSHE RAN AGAINST OBAMA AND YOU WERE AGAINST HER IN THE PRIMARY.\nYOU LIKED BERNIE. YOU SEEM TO BE A RELUCTANT\nHILLARY SUPPORTER. >> YES.\nSHE VOTED FOR THE WAR, I THOUGHT SHE WAS TOO COZY WITH WALL\nSTREET. >> WHAT ABOUT ALL OF THE\nWIKILEAKS DISCLOSURES, DO THEY BOTHER YOU?\n>> NOT AT ALL. >> YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THE\nCLINTON CASH? >> I CARE ABOUT WOMEN SHOULD BE\nPAID THE SAME AS MEN, I CARE ABOUT THE POLAR ICE CAPS\nMELTING, THE BIG BIG ISSUES. THOSE ARE THE ONE YOU HAVE TO\nHAVE THE SMART PERSON IN THE ROOM.\nI MAY NOT AFREE WITH HER, THE POINT IS THAT WE HAVE A CHOICE\nBETWEEN SOMEBODY WHO IS SMART, WHO HAS A HEART, WHO'S GOING TO\nSTAND UP FOR KIDS AND FOR FAMILIES AND WORKING PEOPLE AND\nWE HAVE A BILLIONAIRE WHO JUST SAYS THESE THINGS TRYING TO\nPRETEND THAT HE CARES. AND JUST THE CON WITH ME RIGHT\nNOW, JUST THE CON WHERE THEY'VE TAKEN A PIECE OF MY MOVIE AND\nPUT IT OUT ONLY HALF OF THAT LITTLE CLIP --\n>> DO YOU THINK IT'S KNOWING OR JUST AN ERROR --\n>> NO ERROR. IT'S EITHER THEY'RE DUMB AND I\nHONESTLY DON'T THINK THEY ARE. OR THEY KNOW THEY --\n>> THEY'RE MISLEADING? >> DUMB LIKE A FOX MAYBE.\nTHEY'RE MISLEADING PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY'RE COUNTING ON\nPEOPLE WHO ARE IF THE WORKING CLASS ARE SO DESPERATE AND HURT\nTHAT ALL THEY'LL DO IS HEAR THOSE FEW WORDS AND NOT THE REST\nOF MY PARAGRAPH. >> BEFORE YOU ARTICULATED VERY\nWELL HOW THEY FEEL, THEY WERE WITH DONALD TRUMP.\nHE'S BEATING HER BY 33 POINTS WITH THE WHITE WORKING CLASS.\n>> YES. >> 33 POINTS.\nIT'S HUGE. THEY ARE ATTRACTED NOT JUST TO\nTHE MESSENGER BUT TO THE MESSAGE TOO.\n>> YES. THAT'S SAD.\nREALLY SAD. >> YOU KNOW HOW THEY FEEL.\nTHIS IS THE WAY THAT MANY REPUBLICANS AND WHAT WE NOW\nABOUT THESE FOLKS IS MANY OF THEM FEEL LIKE DISINFRANCHISED\nREPUBLICANS. THEY'RE SICK AND TIRED OF PEOPLE\nTALKING DOWN TO THIS THEM. >> AND THEY'RE NOT IRREDEEMABLE.\n>> AND THEY'RE NOT ALL RACISTS. >> RACISTS WILL DEPLORABLE.\nNO HUMAN IS IRREDEEMABLE. >> MICHAEL MOORE IS SMARTER THAN\nME TELLING MY I SHOULDN'T SUPPORT TRUMP.\n>> WHAT I'M SAYING IS I UNDERSTAND YOU'VE BEEN ABUSED\nAND I'M HERE IN OHIO TO CONDUCT AN INTERVENTION, BASICALLY TO\nSAY THAT SOMETIMES ABUSED PEOPLE HAVE A HARD TIME MAKING THE\nRIGHT DECISION BECAUSE OF THE ABUSE AND THE ATTACK ON THE\nWORKING CLASS HAS BEEN SO INTENSE OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF\nDECADES THAT I UNDERSTAND WHY THERE'S A LOT OF CONFUSION HERE.\nAND TRUMP IS A HUGE BALL OF CONFUSION IN THIS.\nAND IT SEEMS LIKE HE'S GOING TO BE YOUR HUMAN HAND GRENADE THAT\nYOU'RE GOING TO GET TO TOSS IN THERE.\nTHE PHRASE ABOUT THE LEGAL TERRORISTS.\nIT'S ABOUT ACTUALLY WHAT I SAID WAS, IS THAT THERE IS A LEGAL\nWAY ON NOVEMBER 8th TO DO WHAT TRUMP IS GOING TO DO, BLOW UP\nTHE SYSTEM. YOU CAN ASSIST IN THAT BY GOING\nIN THERE AND HANDING THE HAND GRENADE TO DONALD TRUMP.\nI THINK IT'S A RISKY PROPOSITION, A DANGEROUS THING\nTO DO. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE BETTER\nOFF WITH A BILLIONAIRE WHO'S NEVER SPENT A DAY OF HIS LIFE\nWORRYING ABOUT YOU. >> THEY SEE IT AND THEY FIND OUT\nIT'S NOT A PRO-TRUMP FILM, THEY'RE SMART ENOUGH TO TAKE THE\nINFORMATION AND MAKE UP THEIR OWN MIND.\n>> HE'S LIED TO THEM AND I WILL ALREADY HAVE THEIR 5 BUCKS AND I\nWANT TO GIVE IT BACK TO THEM. >> GO FOR IT.\n>> I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THAT. >> YOU CAN GIVE IT TO ME AND\nI'LL MAKE SURE THEY GET IT.",

I'M A BIG BELIEVER IN --\n>> NATURE. >> NO, NOT NATURE.\nI'M A BIG BELIEVER IN NATURAL ABILITY.\nI BELIEVE IN BEING PREPARED AND ALL THAT STUFF.\nBUT IN MANY RESPECTS, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS AN INNATE\nABILITY. >> AND YOU KNEW THIS AS A KID?\n>> NO, I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT AS A KID.\n>> DO YOU THINK YOU HAD IT EVEN THEN?\n>> ALWAYS. >> WHEN YOU LOOK BACK AT\nYOURSELF -- >> I HAD IT.\nI ALWAYS HAD IT. >> I ALWAYS HAD IT.\nI NEVER HAD TO WORK. OTHER PEOPLE HAVE TO PREPARE AND\nDO STUFF, BUT I JUST CAME DOWN FROM HEAVEN, FOR EXAMPLE, AS THE\nGREATEST BASEBALL PLAYER IN NEW YORK.\n>> WERE YOU A GOOD HITTER? >> THE BEST.\n>> I WAS THE BEST HITTER. IT GIVES YOU SOME INSIGHT,\nRIGHT? I MEAN IF THAT IS HOW THIS\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE THINKS OF HIMSELF AND HAS ALWAYS THOUGHT\nOF HIMSELF GOING BACK TO FIRST GRADE -- NO, NO, NO, BEFORE\nFIRST GRADE, I MEAN IF YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THAT IS HOW HE\nTHINKS OF HIMSELF, THEN IT IS NOT A SURPRISE WHEN HE, LIKE,\nFOR EXAMPLE, TODAY ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL TELLS A CROWD OF\nSUPPORTERS IN OHIO THAT BASICALLY HE IS SICK OF THIS\nELECTION. HE IS SICK OF ALL THIS WORKING\nTO EARN THIS PRESIDENCY THING. HE'S SICK OF IT.\nJUST GIVE IT TO ME ALREADY. >> WHAT A DIFFERENCE.\nYOU KNOW, WHAT A DIFFERENCE THIS IS.\nAND JUST THINKING TO MYSELF RIGHT NOW, WE SHOULD JUST CANCEL\nTHE ELECTION AND JUST GIVE IT TO TRUMP, RIGHT?\nWHY ARE WE HAVING IT FOR? >> JUST GIVE IT TO TRUMP.\nWHAT ARE WE HAVING IT FOR? WHAT ARE YOU HAVING THIS\nELECTION FOR? I KNOW.\nIF YOU THINK OF YOURSELF AS A PERSON WHO HAS NEVER ACTUALLY\nHAD TO WORK FOR ANYTHING BECAUSE YOU WERE BORN INNATELY GREAT,\nYOU WERE BORNIN ATELY AS THE GREAT IS ATHLETE, IF YOU WERE\nEXCELLENT AT EVERYTHING YOU EVER TRIED BECAUSE YOU WERE BORN\nBASICALLY PERFECT, THEN WHY SHOULD YOU HAVE TO COMPETE FOR\nSOMETHING. I DESERVE IT BY VIRTUE OF ME\nBEING ME. SO IT OFFERS AN INSIGHT.\nTHIS TAPE FROM THE TRUMP BIOGRAPHER WHICH PROVIDED IT TO\n\"THE NEW YORK TIMES,\" I THINK THIS IS NEWSWORTHY TAPE, AND I\nTHINK IT IS HELPFUL TO UNDERSTANDING HOW DONALD TRUMP\nIS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT NOW, BECAUSE HE ON TAPE HERE TALKS IN\nTHIS VERY UNGUARDED WAY ABOUT HOW HE SEES HIMSELF AND THAT IS\nA RARE THING WE DON'T EVER GET FROM ANY CANDIDATE, LET ALONE\nFROM HIM. BUT THERE IS ANOTHER PIECE OF\nTHIS TAPE THAT HAS NEVER BEEN HEARD PUBLICLY BEFORE, WHICH WE\nHAVE GOT FOR YOU IN JUST A SECOND.\nAND THIS OTHER PIECE OF TAPE, I THINK THIS IS JUST LIKE A DART\nINTO THE HEART OF TODAY'S NEWS. AND IT'S ON A SUBJECT THAT HAS\nONLY COME UP A LITTLE BIT IN THE CAMPAIGN SO FAR.\nIT CAME UP FOR AN INSTANT EARLIER IN THIS CAMPAIGN WHEN\nDONALD TRUMP NAMED MIKE PENCE TO BE HIS RUNNING MATE.\nONE OF THE CONTROVERSIAL THINGS IN MIKE PENCE'S RECORD IS THAT\nHE IS ON RECORD BEING AGAINST WOMEN IN THE MILITARY.\nFROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF HIM RUNNING FOR CONGRESS, MIKE PENCE\nWAS AGAINST NOT JUST WOMEN IN COMBAT, BUT EVEN WOMEN BEING IN\nCOMBAT SUPPORT UNITS. HE WAS EVEN AGAINST WOMEN BEING\nALLOWED TO DO BASIC TRAINING FOR THE MILITARY.\nMIKE PENCE WROTE THIS CREEPY COLUMN IN 1999 ABOUT YOUNG\nNUBILE 18-YEAR-OLD WOMEN IN BASIC TRAINING.\nTHE COLUMN ENDS WITH THIS LINE, I KID YOU NOT.\nWOMEN IN THE MILITARY, BAD IDEA. THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE OF HIS\nCOLUMN ON WOMEN IN THE MILITARY. SO THAT'S ON RECORD ALREADY FROM\nMIKE PENCE, DONALD TRUMP'S RUNNING MATE, WHEN PENCE WAS A\nTALK RADIO HOST. THAT WAS THE TIME HE LOST\nRUNNING FOR CONGRESS. THAT RUN MOST REMEMBERED FOR\nMIKE PENCE USING CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS TO PAY FOR HIS\nMORTGAGE, HIS GROCERY BILLS, HIS CAR PAYMENT AND HIS GOLFING\nFEES. HE LET HIS DONORS PAY FOR ALL\nTHAT STUFF. IF MIKE PENCE WERE RUNNING IN\nANY NORMAL REPUBLICAN, I THINK HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A SCANDAL AS\nA RUNNING MATE. THINGS IN HIS RECORD WOULD HAVE\nBEEN A SCANDAL AND A PROBLEM TO HIS RUNNING MATE.\nIT IS TESTAMENT TO DONALD TRUMP THAT HE IS SO CONTROVERSIAL THAT\nPICKING MIKE PENCE WITH MIKE PENCE'S RECORD, IT HASN'T GIVEN\nDONALD TRUMP A SINGLE DAY OF HEARTBURN IN THE ENTIRE\nCAMPAIGN. I MEAN IF IN THIS CAMPAIGN\nANYBODY COULD PAY ATTENTION TO MIKE PENCE FOR MORE THAN TEN\nSECONDS WITHOUT PASSING OUT FOR LACK OF OXYGEN, THIS THING FROM\nHIM ABOUT WOMEN IN THE MILITARY, BAD IDEA, THAT WOULD BE A\nSCANDAL, RIGHT? THAT WOULD BE A PROBLEM FOR A\nCAMPAIGN. MAYBE IT WILL BE STILL SOME DAY.\nFOR A LONG TIME I FELT LIKE THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN A LURKING\nLIABILITY FOR TRUMP AND PENCE, JUST SORT OF WAITING AT SOME\nPOINT TO CAUSE THEM TROUBLE. WELL, NOW THAT TROUBLE MAY\nFINALLY BE COMING TO PASS, BECAUSE NOW WITH THIS NEW TAPE\nTHAT WE ARE ABOUT TO BROADCAST FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, THIS\nHAS NEVER BEEN HEARD PUBLICLY ANY TIME BEFORE, THIS IS THE\nFIRST TIME ANYWHERE, HERE IS DONALD TRUMP NOT 16 YEARS AGO OR\n18 YEARS AGO WHEN MIKE PENCE WAS TALKING ABOUT THIS STUFF, HERE'S\nDONALD TRUMP TWO YEARS AGO IN 2014, UNPROMPTED, ANSWERING A\nTOTALLY UNRELATED QUESTION. JUST DECIDING TO BRING UP\nVOLUNTARILY HIS DONALD TRUMP OPINION ON WOMEN IN THE\nMILITARY. >> WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG, WHAT DID\nYOU THINK OF THE '60s COUNTERCULTURE, THE HIPPIES, THE\nMUSIC? YOU DIDN'T DO ANY OF THAT STUFF.\n>> NO, I WASN'T INTO IT. IT WASN'T THAT I WASN'T INTO IT.\n>> WHAT DID YOU THINK? >> WELL, I WENT -- I WENT TO A\nMILITARY ACADEMY, WHICH WAS FROM A DIFFERENT PLANET.\nWE DIDN'T HAVE THAT. AND WE DIDN'T HAVE WOMEN IN THE\nACADEMY AT THAT TIME. TODAY YOU HAVE WOMEN, WHICH IS A\nWHOLE OTHER STORY, YOU KNOW, WOMEN IN THE ARMY, AND YOU SEE\nWHAT'S GOING ON. IT'S LIKE BEDLAM.\nIT IS BEDLAM. IT'S SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE\nAREN'T TALKING ABOUT, BUT WHAT'S GOING ON IS BEDLAM, BRINGING\nWOMEN IN THE ARMY. >> BRINGING WOMEN IN THE ARMY,\nWOMEN IN THE MILITARY, IT'S BEDLAM.\nAND HIS RUNNING MATE SAYS WOMEN IN THE MILITARY, BAD IDEA.\nASK MILITARY FAMILIES HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT THAT IN A POTENTIAL\nCOMMANDER IN CHIEF. ASK WOMEN IN THE MILITARY HOW\nTHEY FEEL ABOUT THAT IN A POTENTIAL COMMANDER IN CHIEF.\nASK WOMEN IN GENERAL HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT THAT.\nBRINGING WOMEN INTO THE ARMY, BEDLAM.\nIT'S SOMETHING PEOPLE AREN'T TALKING ABOUT, BUT WHAT'S GOING\nON IS BEDLAM. BRINGING WOMEN IN THE ARMY, IT'S\nBEDLAM. WOMEN IN THE MILITARY, BAD IDEA.\nTHE TWO OF THEM ARE IN LINE ON THAT QUESTION.\nIT IS, THEREFORE, A REASONABLE QUESTION TO ASK IF TRUMP AND\nPENCE DO GET ELECTED, WILL THEY KICK ALL WOMEN OUT OF THE\nMILITARY? THEY'RE BOTH ON RECORD SAYING IT\nIS A TERRIBLE THING THAT WOMEN ARE IN THE MILITARY.\nIT'S A TERRIBLE THING, IT'S EVEN A DISGUSTING THING.\nWE OUGHT TO GO BACK TO ONLY MEN SERVING IN THE MILITARY.\nIS THAT WHAT WE SHOULD DO? THIS ONE HAS BEEN LURKING JUST\nUNDER THE SURFACE FOR THEM FOR QUITE A WHILE, BUT NOW WE'VE GOT\nIT ON TAPE. I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR AN ANSWER\nFOR THIS.           mus p                lang ]",

EVERYBODY ON BOARD IS FINE,\nTHERE WERE NO INJURIES REPORTED INCLUDING TO GOVERNOR PENCE OR\nHIS FAMILY. THERE WERE BETWEEN 30 AND 40\nPEOPLE ON BOARD THE GOVERNOR'S JET, IT'S A CHARTERED 737.\nGOVERNOR PENCE, HIS WIFE, ONE OF HIS KIDS, ABOUT 15 SECRET\nSERVICE AGENTS AND A DOZEN MEMBERS OF THE PRESS WERE ON\nTHAT PLANE. WE ALSO THINK WE SAW A\nCONGRESSMAN FROM TEXAS. WE HEARD THAT A 737 USUALLY\nCOMES IN FOR A LANDING AT 155 MILES AN HOUR AND WHEN IT'S A\nWET, SLICK NIGHT LIKE TONIGHT, THIS KIND OF THING CAN HAPPEN.\nBUT THE FAA AND MAYBE THE NTSB WILL BE LOOKING INTO THIS\nINCIDENT TO DETERMINE EXACTLY WHAT CAUSED IT HERE.\nI'LL SHOW YOU AGAIN, THIS IS WHAT THE PLANE DID TO THE TARMAC\nAT LaGUARDIA AS IT SLID OFF THE RUNWAY.\nI DIDN'T KNOW THAT THAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU SLID OFF A RUNWAY.\nALL THE AIR TRAFFIC AT LaGUARDIA WAS SUSPENDED FOR OVER AN HOUR\nIN THE WAKE OF THIS INCIDENT. WE ARE TOLD AS SOON AS THE PLANE\nCAME TO A REST FOLLOWING ITS ROUGH LANDING AND ITS SLIDE INTO\nTHE GRASS WITH MUD FLYING UP AND HITTING THE WINDOWS, GOVERNOR\nPENCE IMMEDIATELY CAME TO THE BACK OF THE PLANE TO CHECK THAT\nEVERYBODY WAS OKAY. GOD BLESS HIM, THAT'S THE RIGHT\nTHING TO DO. AS YOU CAN SEE HE'S FINE.\nHE ALSO STOPPED WITH PHOTOS WITH FIRST RESPONDERS IN THE RAIN.\nHE HAD BEEN SCHEDULED TO ATTEND A FUND-RAISER IN NEW YORK CITY\nTONIGHT BUT HIS SPOKESMAN SAID INSTEAD HE IS HEADED TO HIS\nHOTEL FOR THE NIGHT, ABSOLUTELY TOTALLY UNDERSTANDABLE.\nABOUT AN HOUR AFTER THE INCIDENT THE GOVERNOR TWEETED SO THANKFUL\nEVERYONE ON OUR PLANE IS SAFE. GRATEFUL FOR OUR FIRST\nRESPONDERS AND THE CONCERN AND PRAYERS OF SO MANY.\nBACK ON THE TRAIL TOMORROW. AGAIN, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING\nHERE IS NO INJURIES AS FAR AS WE KNOW.\nBUT CERTAINLY SOME JANGLED NERVES AND SOME RUSHES OF\nADRENALINE AND NONE OF US NEED ANY OF THAT AT THIS TIME.\nJOINING US NOW IS A MAN ONBOARD THAT PLANE, VAUGHN HILLYARD.\nHE WAS ON THE PLANE WHEN IT SLID OFF THE RUNWAY.\nVAUGHN, LET ME SHAKE YOUR HAND. I'M GLAD YOU'RE OKAY.\nWERE YOU SCARED? >> NO.\nTHE CRAZY PART IS THIS WAENLT THE FIRST TIME -- FIRST TIME\nWE'VE GONE OFF THE RUNWAY, BUT WE'VE HAD A LOT OF SHAKY\nINCIDENTS IN THE PAST. HARD IMPACT, TOUGH LANDINGS.\nWE ACTUALLY PULLED OUT THE PHONE THIS TIME AND I SNAPPED\nORIGINALLY ABOUT TEN SECONDS OF VIDEO, WHICH I'M TRYING TO GET\nINTO THE SYSTEM HERE EVENTUALLY FOR EVERYBODY, BUT THE CRAZY\nPART WAS ORIGINALLY WE HAD THE HARD IMPACT AND THEN WE WENT TWO\nOR THREE SECONDS AND THAT'S WITH WE STARTED TO SWERVE OFF TO THE\nRIGHT. AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN WE COME\nTO JUST A HARD CRASHING STOP. AND THAT'S WHEN YOU LOOKED OUT\nTHE WINDOW AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THE ROAD WAS ODDLY CLOSE TO\nWHERE THE PLANE WAS AT. >> THE ROAD WITH CARS ON IT.\n>> THE ROAD WITH CARS. THE CIRCLE K ACROSS THE STREET.\nTHAT'S WHEN IT BECAME REAL. >> SO WHEN YOU SAY YOU WERE\nTRYING TO GET TAPE, YOU WERE FILMING AS YOU WERE LANDING.\nIS THAT BECAUSE YOU WERE EXPECTING A HARD LANDING BECAUSE\nYOU'VE HAD SO MANY? >> IT'S A JOKE.\nIT'S A JOKE HOW LONG ARE WE GOING TO LAST.\nTHAT'S THE PART THE FACT THAT I'M ON WITH YOU TONIGHT IS SORT\nOF THE INTERESTING END OF THIS. THIS CAMERA, WE'VE CAPTURED A\nLOT OF CRAZY THINGS IN THIS CAMPAIGN, BUT TO GET TO THE\nPOINT WHERE THIS IS THE NEWS OF THE NIGHT WAS --\n>> WAIT A SECOND. YOU'RE SAYING IT'S BECOME A JOKE\nHOW LONG ARE WE GOING TO LAST. YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE HARD\nLANDINGS ON THE PENCE CAMPAIGN PLANE SPECIFICALLY ARE SO\nFREQUENT AND SO NOTABLE THAT IT'S A POINT OF DISCUSSION AMONG\nTHE PRESS CORPS? >> YES.\nAND I'LL BE HONEST THAT I'VE NEVER PURSUED THAT.\nWE HAVEN'T PURSUED ASKING QUESTIONS FURTHER ABOUT THAT\nBECAUSE USUALLY WE DON'T FLY ON PRIVATE, I GUESS, CHARTER\nFLIGHTS ON CAMPAIGN. THIS IS MY FIRST CAMPAIGN\nCOVERING SO WE JUST TOOK IT FOR GRANTED.\n>> HAVE YOU ONLY HAD BAD LANDINGS IN HEAVY WEATHER?\n>> NO. WE LANDED IN FT. DODGE, IOWA,\nEARLIER AND WE HAD ANOTHER ROUGH LANDING WHERE WE HIT.\nIT FELT LIKE WE WENT BACK INTO THE AIR.\nYOU COULD SEE THE BLUE SKY AGAIN.\nOF COURSE WE DIDN'T GO OFF THE RUNWAY AT THAT POINT.\n>> I'M JUST GOING TO PUT THIS TO YOU.\nI'VE GOT A -- I WENT BACK AND LOOKED AT MY EARLIER COVERAGE\nABOUT SOMETHING INVOLVING THE MIKE PENCE CAMPAIGN.\nI AM SURE THIS IS JUST COINCIDENTAL, BUT THIS IS NOT\nTHE FIRST TIME THAT WE ON THIS SHOW HAVE TALKED ABOUT ISSUES\nINVOLVING MIKE PENCE'S CAMPAIGN PLANE.\nAND I'VE NEVER BEEN ON THAT CAMPAIGN PLANE SO IT'S NOT LIKE\nI WAS REPORTING A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE.\nIT WAS LATE LAST MONTH WE LEARNED THAT THE PILOT, WHO IS\nENTRUSTED WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WITH FLYING THE PENCE\nCAMPAIGN AND HIS PRESS CORPS AND HIS FAMILY AROUND THE COUNTRY,\nHE MADE NEWS BECAUSE HE WAS FIRED FOR AN UNUSUAL REASON.\nTHE GUARDIAN WAS FIRST TO REPORT THAT THE PILOT FOR THE PENCE\nPLANE UNTIL ONE MONTH AGO WAS A RETIRED POLICE OFFICER IN\nADDITION TO BEING PENCE'S PILOT. HE WAS THE CHAIRMAN OF DONALD\nTRUMP'S FLORIDA LAW ENFORCEMENT COALITION.\nAND \"THE GUARDIAN\" REPORTED THAT HE WAS ACTIVELY FACING CRIMINAL\nCHARGES OF AGGRAVATED BATTERY WITH A DEADLY WEAPON.\nIN 2015 HE HAD ALLEGEDLY DRIVEN OVER A CO-WORKER WITH HIS CAR\nTHREE TIMES ON PURPOSE, CAUSING THE CO-WORKER SEVERE PHYSICAL\nINJURIES. HIS NAME IS VINCENT CALDERA.\nHE PLED NOT GUILTY TO THOSE CHARGES BUT IT TURNED OUT THOSE\nWEREN'T THE ONLY CHARGES AGAINST HIM.\nHE WAS ACCUSED OF A SIMILAR INCIDENT IN 2014.\nIN THAT CASE HE WAS ACCUSED OF DRIVING INTO A WOMAN WITH HIS\nMOTORCYCLE ON PURPOSE AND SERIOUSLY INJURING HER.\n\"THE GUARDIAN\" REPORTED LAST MONTH HE HADN'T ACTUALLY BEEN\nFORMALLY CHARGED IN RELATION TO THAT EPISODE BECAUSE THEY HADN'T\nBEEN ABLE TO LOCATE HIM TO SERVE HIM WITH LEGAL PAPERS.\nMEANWHILE HE'S FLYING THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AROUND\nTHE COUNTRY. SO THAT'S THE PILOT WHO GOT\nFIRED FROM THE PENCE CAMPAIGN PLANE LAST MONTH.\nDO YOU KNOW WHO THEY REPLACED HIM WITH?\n>> I DO NOT KNOW WHO THE GENTLEMAN IS.\nTHEY SWITCH PEOPLE OUT. >> SO IT'S ROTATING?\n>> SO IT'S A ROTATING BASIS, YEAH.\n>> HOW OLD ARE YOU? >> 25.\n>> HAVE YOU DONE A LOT OF FLYING IN YOUR REPORTING JOB AND IN\nYOUR PERSONAL LIFE? >> YES.\n>> IS THE PENCE CAMPAIGN PLANE THE ONLY CAMPAIGN PLANE ON WHICH\nYOU HAVE HAD HARD LANDINGS LIKE THIS?\n>> THAT'S ACCURATE. >> THAT'S REALLY WEIRD.\nJOHN HILLYARD. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE\nRELATIONSHIP IS BETWEEN THESE TWO HALVES OF THIS STORY, BUT\nKNOWING THAT THIS RUNWAY THING HAPPENED TONIGHT AFTER A SERIES\nOF HARD LANDINGS THAT WAS A TOPIC OF DISCUSSION BY YOU GUYS,\nIT WEIRDS ME OUT AND WE WILL TRY TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT.\nAND I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE OKAY. THANKS.\nAPPRECIATE IT. NBC NEWS EMBED VAUGHN HILLYARD.\nHE'S GREAT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.",

WELCOME TO \"THE KELLY FILE.\"\nI'M MEGYN KELLY. YOU'RE LOOKING AT BRAND-NEW\nPICTURES AT THE MOMENT THAT THE PLANE CARRYING THE VICE\nPRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE ON THE GOP TICKET SLID OFF THE RUN RAE AT\nNEW YORK'S LaGUARDIA AIRPORT ON A RAINY NIGHT IN MAN HAT.\nWE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE FOX NEWS PRODUCER ON BOARD THE\nPLANE. AS THIS HAPPENED HE SHOT THIS\nEXCLUSIVE VIDEO. FIRST TO TRACE GALLAGHER WHAT IS\nAT THE BREAKING NEWS DESK WITH WHAT WE KNOW.\n>> THE 737 WHICH TOUCHES DOWN AROUND 120 MILES AN HOUR, WAS\nCOMING IN KIND OF HOT. HE WAS ON BOARD THE PLANE AND\nTHEN HE SAYS IT BEGAN SKIDDING AND TO QUOTE HIM HE SAYS IT WAS\nTHE CRAZIEST LANDING HE'S EVER EXPERIENCE ND.\nHE SMELLING BURNING RUBBER BEFORE IT CAME TO REST IN THE\nGRASS AT THE END OF THE RUNWAY. MIKE PENCE CAME TO THE BACK OF\nTHE PLANE TO SEE THAT EVERYONE ON BOARD WAS OKAY.\nTHE PLANES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT USE A COMBINATION OF BRAKES AND\nREVERSE THRUSTERS. BUT ONE OF THE REASONS YOU DON'T\nSEE 737s FLYING IN AND OUT OF LaGUARDIA IS BECAUSE THE RUNWAYS\nAREN'T THAT LONG. THIS RUNWAY IS 7,000 FEET.\nTHAT'S 3,000 FEET SHORTER THAN WHAT YOU WOULD FIND AT NEWARK OR\nJFK. AS A RULE, 737s ONLY NEED 4,000\nFEET. BUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT RAINY\nWEATHER LIKE THEY HAVE TONIGHT AT LaGUARDIA, THAT CHANGES THE\nMATH. IT'S THARD TO TELL WHEN YOU LOOK\nAT THE PICTURES WHICH ANGLE AND WHICH DIRECTION THE PLANE CAME\nIN. BUT ANYBODY WHO HAS FLOWN IN AND\nOUT OF LaGUARDIA KNOW THEY HAVE WATER AT THE END OF THE RUNWAYS.\nTHIS PLANE SLID ONLY AS FAR AS THE GRASS AND THE PASSENGERS\nSTAYED ON THE PLANE TEN MINUTES BEFORE RESCUE TEAMS ARRIVE.\nEVERYBODY WALKED OFF BOARD. THE GOVERNOR REPORTEDLY WAS\nTRAVELING WITH CAMPAIGN ADVISERS, THE MEDIA AS WELL AS\nHIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER. WE'RE TOLD THAT DONALD TRUMP DID\nREACH OUT TO MIKE PENCE AND SAYS THAT HE'S GLAD EVERYONE ON BOARD\nIS SAFE. THERE APPEARS -- IF YOU LOOK AT\nTHE PLANE, THERE APPEARS TO BE SOME DAMAGE TO THE RUNWAY BUT NO\nNOTICEABLE DAMAGE TO THE AIRPLANE ITSELF.\nBUT THIS PLANE IS NOT LEAVING FOR A WHILE, MEGYN.\n>> TRACE, THANK YOU. JOINING US FOR MORE IS DAN GALLO\nWHO WAS ON THE PLANE. WAS IT OBVIOUS WHEN THE PLANE\nWAS LANDING THAT YOU WERE IN TROUBLE?\n>> WELL, YOU KNOW, I MENTIONED TO SOME OWE PEOPLE TONIGHT WE'VE\nHAD SOME INTERESTING LANDINGS IN THIS PLANE.\nI CAN'T EXPLAIN WHY THEY'VE BEEN REALLY ROUGH LANDINGS.\nWE'VE KIND OF GOTTEN USED TO THAT.\nBUT THIS ONE FELT LIKE WE WERE BEING PULLED OFF TO THE SIDE.\nFRANKLY, A SENSATION THAT I'VE NEVER FELT BEFORE IN A LANDING.\nIT DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT. I DON'T KNOW AIRCRAFT THAT WELL.\nI JUST KNEW IT DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT BUT I COULDN'T SEE MUCH OUTSIDE\nOF THE WINDOW OF THE PLANE SO I COULDN'T TELL IF WE WERE IN THE\nGRASS, GOING SIDEWAYS ON THE RUNWAY OR WHATEVER.\nBUT IT FELT LIKE IT WAS PULLING TO ONE SIDE.\nAND THEN IT CAME TO A REALLY ABRUPT STOP AFTER IT FELT LIKE\nTHEY HAD BEEN JAMMING ON THE BRAKES FOR THE DURATION OF THE\nLANDING. >> AND LIKE ANY GOOD PRODUCER\nYOU TOOK OUR YOUR CELL PHONE AND STARTED FILMING THINGS ONCE\nTHINGS SETTLED DOWN. THERE'S CERTAINLY NO PANIC ON\nTHE FLIGHT. WHAT WAS THE FIRST YOU SAW OF\nGOVERNOR PENCE? >> I WOULD SAY A MINUTE OR TWO\nAFTER LANDING. HE WALKED BACK AND ASKED IF\nEVERYONE WAS OKAY. OF COURSE EVERYONE WAS FINE.\nWE WERE ALL WEARING OUR SEAT BELTS.\nIF WE HADN'T BEEN WEARING OUR SEAT BELTS, COULD HAVE BEEN A\nPROBLEM. ADDS HE WAS WAID\nGOVERNOR PENCE, 2016 BECAUSE IT FEELS LIKE THIS IS ALL -- YOU\nKNOW, EVERYTHING ELSE HAS HAPPENED IN 2016, WHY NOT THIS.\n>> WERE YOU -- DID YOU HAVE TO GO DOWN THE EMERGENCY SLIDE TO\nGET OUT? HOW DID YOU EXIT THE AIRCRAFT?\n>> NO, NO SLIDING. WE WAITED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES.\nWE COULD SEE THE EMERGENCY LIGHTS OUTSIDE THE WINDOW OF THE\nPLANE. COULDN'T SEE A WHOLE LOT BECAUSE\nTHE RAIN WAS FOGGING UP THE WINDOWS OF THE PLANE.\nBUT YEAH, WE WALKED DOWN THE STAIRS.\nSOMEHOW THEY GOT STAIRS AND WE WALKED DOWN WHERE THERE WAS\nMORNING PERSONNEL OUTSIDE THE PLANE.\n>> EVERYONE IS OKAY, INSCLUGD THE GOVERNOR, INCLUDING YOU.\nGLAD TO HEA IT. AS YOU SAY, DAN GALLO, 2016.\n>> I GOT SOME MUD ON MY SHOES AFTER TONIGHT.\n>> GREAT TO HEAR FROM YOU. GLAD TO HEAR EVERYONE IS ALL\nRIGHT.",

      "text": ">>> ALSO BREAKING TONIGHT, 12\nDAYS UNTIL AMERICANS ELECT THEIR NEXT PRESIDENT, THERE IS GROWING\nPRESSURE ON HILLARY CLINTON TO RESPOND TO THE LATEST LEAKED\nCAMPAIGN E-MAILS. THESE NOTES REFLECT THE\nLUCRATIVE TIME IN BILL AND HILLARY'S CAREERS.\nTHE YEARS AFTER THEY LEFT THE WHITE HOUSE AND WHILE MRS.\nCLINTON SERVED AS SECRETARY OF STATE.\nA MEMO WRITTED BY DOUG BAND, HE DETAILS WHAT HE CALLS BILL\nCLINTON, INC. STEERING TOP TIER CORPORATIONS\nTO DONATE TO THE CLINTON CHARITY AND BANK ROLL THE CLINTON'S\nLIFESTYLE. CONTRIBUTING MILLIONS TO THE\nCLINTON FAMILY'S PERSONAL FORTUNE.\nWE'VE GOT A BIG LINEUP, CHARLES  >> GOOD TO SEE YOU.\nAFTER NOVEMBER 8th, SOME OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL CORPORATIONS\nMAY STILL BE POURING MONEY IN. WHILE BILL AND HILLARY SWEAR OFF\nNEW FUNDING FOR THE FOUNDATION, THIS LEAKED MEMO SUGGESTS THAT\nTHE DOOR IS OPEN FOR MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF SPEAKING FEE TO FLOW\nTO BILL CLINTON EVEN IF HIS WIFE IS PRESIDENT.\nDETAILING WHAT YOU CALLED BILL CLINTON, INC.\nNOT COMING FROM TRUMP, COMING FROM DOUG BAND.\nNOW ON THE OUT AFTER HE ALLEGED IT WAS A STRATEGY ACTUALLY TO\nSTEER DONORS FOR THE FOUNDATION TO HIRE MR. CLINTON FOR SPEECHES\nAND CONSULTING. THE 201 IS MEMO REVEALING 30,000\nFOR HIM PERSONALLY AND $66 MILLION TO BE PAID OUT OVER THE\nNEXT NINE YEARS, MEANING IT COULD CONTINUE UNTIL 2020 OR THE\nEND OF HIS WIFE'S FIRST TERM IF SHE'S IN OFFICE UNLESS THERE'S\nPUBLIC PRESSURE AND BILL CLINTON IS FORCED TO SEVER THE CONTACTS.\nTHIS IS AFTER CHELSEA CLINTON BLEW THE WHISTLE.\nHE FURTHER ALLEGED THE FORMER PRESIDENT WAS COLLECTING MONEY\nFROM AT LEAST THREE SPONSORS OF CGI, THE CLINTON GLOBAL\nINITIATIVE AND ACCEPTED PERSONAL GIFTS AS WELL.\n>> UH-HUH. ED, THANK YOU.\nTHE QUESTION TONIGHT IS HOW MUCH DOES THIS STUNNING NEW\nINFORMATION REINFORCE SOME OF THE WORST PERCEPTIONS OF HILLARY\nCLINTON. AND HOW MUCH DOES IT MATTER?\nJUST 12 DAYS AWAY FROM THE ELECTION.\nTOM BEVIN IS COFOUNDER AND PUBLISHER OF REAL POLITICS.COM\nAND MONICA CROWLEY A FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR.\nGREAT TO SEE YOU. MONICA LET ME START WITH YOU.\n>> THE MOST PROBLEMATIC SCANDALS FOR ANY CANDIDATE IS A ONE THAT\nREINFORCES A PREEXISTING NOTION FOR THAT PERSON.\nTHIS PROBLEM FOR HILLARY CLINTON IS THESE DISCLOSURES REMIND\nVOTERS OF 30 YEARS OF THE PURE CHAUGS WHEN MOST PEOPLE FEEL\nWHEN EXPOSED TO THE CLINTONS FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME.\nWHEN YOU'RE GETTING THE WIKILEAKS DRIP DRIP DRIP OF PAY\nTO PLAY AND THAT + CLINTON LEVERAGED HER OFFICE AS\nSECRETARY OF STATUTE, IT TELLS VOTERS, GIVES THEM A GLIMPSE OF\nTHE PAST, WHAT WE EXPERIENCED WITH THE FIRST CLINTON\nPRESIDENCY AND A GLIMPSE OF THE FUTURE OF WHAT A HILLARY CLINTON\nPREZ DEN WOULD BE. THAT'S NOT A GOOD LOOK FOR HER.\n>> IT MAKES IT SOUND THAT BILL CLINTON WAS GETTING RICH.\nA LITTLE FOR THE CHARITY AND WHAT ABOUT BILL.\nHERE I AM. SHE'S NOT PROMISING TO SHUT THIS\nTHING DOWN IF SHE BECOMES PRESIDENT.\n>> MEGYN, FIRST OF ALL, WE HAVE TO SAY THAT RUSSIA IS TRYING TO\nHAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR ELECTION. >> IT'S BAD, BAD.\n>> RUSSIA IS NOT ANY GOOD. PUTIN WANTS DONALD TRUMP TO BE\nPRESIDENT. THAT'S WHY THIS IS PUBLIC TO\nBEGIN WITH. >> THAT IS ALL TRUE AND VALID.\nLET'S TALK ABOUT IT. >> YES.\nSECOND POINT, AT THIS POINT IN THE ELECTION VOTERS ARE VOTING,\n10 MILLION VOTERS HAVE VOTED. THE REST OF THE VOTERS IN THE\nFINAL DAYS HERE ARE TRYING TO DECIDE WHO IS THE BEST PERSON TO\nBE COMMANDER IN CHIEF. YOU LOOK AT THIS NEWS AND YOU'RE\nA TRUMP SUPPORTER, IT REINFORCES WHAT YOU ALREADY THOUGHT ABOUT\nTHE CLINTONS. IF YOU'RE A CLINTON SUPPORTER\nYOU THINK WHATEVER, ENOUGH WITH THE WIKILEAKS.\nFOR THE FOLKS IN THE MIDDLE U, THEY'RE TRYING TO DECIDE WHO IS\nGOING TO BE THE BEST COMMANDER IN CHIEF.\nTHIS IS NOT DOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT WHATSOEVER ON WHETHER\nPEOPLE THINK THAT HILLARY CLINTON SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT BE\nTHE COMMANDER IN CHIEF. DONALD TRUMP IS RUNNING OUT OF\nPATHS TO 270 ELECTORAL VOTES AND THIS DOES NOT CREATE A NEW ONE\nFOR HIM. >> LET'S PICK IT UP WITH YOU,\nDON. THE TRUMP CAMP BELIEVES THEY\nHAVE MOMENTUM THE. THE FOX NEWS SHOWS HER LEADING\nONLY BY THREE, WITH HER LEAD SHRINKING, AND HIS STANDING WITH\nINDEPENDENTS AND REPUBLICANS GETTING BETTER.\n>> WELL, LOOK. I AGREE THAT TRUMP IS BEHIND\nRIGHT NEW AND HAS A LOT OF GROUND TO MAKE UP.\nWHERE I DISAGREE WITH BILL, THOSE VOTERS IN THE MIDDLE ARE\nTRYING TO DECIDE, RIGHT, AND THIS REINFORCES UL OF THE WORST\nPERCEPTIONS. THE ONE THING WE KNOW IS WHOEVER\nIS UNDER THE SPOTLIGHT SUFFERS. CLINTON IS UNDER THE SPOTLIGHT\nBECAUSE OF THIS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON HAD GOING FOR HER OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS, SHE\nHAD HER BASE RALLIES TO HER, THE MILLENNIALS WHO WERE IFFY ON\nHER. THIS KIND OF NEWS MIGHT DAMPEN\nTHE ENTHUENTHUSIASM. >> WHAT ABOUT THAT?\nTHERE WAS A REPORT TODAY THAT THAT'S PART OF TRUMP'S GAME PLAN",

YOU GUYS HAD AN AMAZING WIN LAST\nYEAR FOR THAT CITY WHICH I THINK YOU COULD PALPABY FEEL HOW\nINCREDIBLE IT WAS WHEN WE WERE THERE THIS SUMMER.\nCLEVELAND INDIANS PLAYING GREAT BASEBALL IN THESE PLAYOFFS.\nI'M VERY EXCITED. I WILL BE AT WRIGLEY SATURDAY\nNIGHT. I'M EXCITED ABOUT THAT.\nLET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR STATE. THIS IS A HEAVY LIFT.\nIT'S REALLY INTERESTING GOING THROUGH DATA, LOOKING SORT OF\nGETTING IN THERE. YOU'RE SEEING THIS INTERESTING\nTHING HAPPEN IN THIS RACE WHERE YOU GOT A STATE LIKE VIRGINIA\nWHERE, YOU KNOW, TWO CYCLES AGO PEOPLE SAID DEMOCRATS IN\nVIRGINIA, I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY'RE GOING TO WIN VIRGINIA,\nDEMOCRATS NOW, HILLARY CLINTON, THEY'RE UP BY SIZABLE PORTIONS.\nIT IS ABSOLUTELY NECK AND NECK IN OHIO.\n>> VIRGINIA, ACTUALLY, BOTH IN '08 AND '12, THE MARGINS WERE\nBIGGER FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA IN VIRGINIA THAN OHIO.\nOHIO ALMOST ALWAYS GOES WITH THE WINNER.\nHILLARY IS GOING TO WIN OHIO. THE POLLS ARE VERY CLOSE NOW.\nI CAN SEE TWO THINGS HAPPENING. I CAN SEE UNION MEMBERS WHO\nMIGHT HAVE FLIRTED WITH TRUMP A LITTLE BIT ARE COMING AROUND TO\nVOTE FOR HILLARY. I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN\nUNION HALLS, A LOT OF TIME TALKING TO WORKERS, AND UNION\nACTIVISTS ARE TALKING TO THEIR CO-WORKERS THAT ALSO BELONG TO\nTHE UNION AND ARE NOT YET THERE AND ARE MOVING TOWARD HILLARY.\nTHE OTHER THING THAT'S HAPPENING, A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE\nTHAT MAY HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT GARY JOHNSON IN JULY AND AUGUST AND\nSEPTEMBER ARE NOW REALIZING THAT, ONE, HE DOESN'T REALLY\nREPRESENT WHAT THEY BELIEVE, AND SECOND, THEY UNDERSTAND THAT HOW\nIMPORTANT IT IS SO VOTE FOR HILLARY AGAINST TRUMP.\nSO SHE'S GOING TO WIN THE STATE. IT'S GOING TO BE NOT AS -- IT'S\nGOING TO BE CLOSER THAN MAYBE VIRGINIA, CERTAINLY\nPENNSYLVANIA, WISCONSIN, MICHIGAN.\nSHE'S GOING TO DO WELL HERE. >> IT'S AMAZING WHEN YOU LOOK AT\nCOUNTY BREAKDOWNS IN A STATE LIKE OHIO WHERE DEMOCRATS HAVE\nENORMOUS MARGINS IN MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREAS.\nTHEY THEN HAVE TO SORT OF FIGHT TO KEEP THAT MARGIN IN RURAL\nAREAS, PARTICULARLY. THERE WAS THIS MOMENT ON FOX\nNEWS I WANTED TO PLAY YOU IN WHICH IT WAS SORT OF A CAT OUT\nOF THE BAG MOMENT ABOUT WHAT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT WITH BILL\nHEMMER TALKING TO SEAN SPICER. TAKE A LISTEN.\n>> I'M LOOKING AT EARLY VOTING. >> SO ARE WE.\nYOU HAVE GOOD NEWS IN OHIO. >> WE DO.\n>> WHITE SHARE OF THE VOTE IS UP THREE POINTS.\nBLACK SHARE OF THE VOTE IS DOWN SEVEN.\n>> EARLY VOTE IS WHERE DEMOCRATS DO WELL.\nWE DO VERY WELL ON ELECTION DAY. REPUBLICANS TEND TO SHOW UP.\nDEMOCRATS NEED TO DO VERY, VERY WELL.\nI'M TALKING -- I'M TALKING ABOUT MAIL-IN BALLOTS.\nI'M NOT TALKING ABOUT IN-PERSON VOTING.\n>> I UNDERSTAND THAT. >> I MEAN, AT ONE LEVEL IT'S\nTRUE, RIGHT, THAT IS GOOD NEWS FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, BUT\nIT'S ALSO SORT OF JUST REMARKABLE THING TO THINK ABOUT\nIN THE CONTEXT OF WHERE WE ARE IN TERMS OF AN AMERICAN\nDEMOCRACY. >> YEAH, THEY -- I MEAN, IT'S\nABOUT SUPPRESSING THE VOTE FOR THIS CROWD.\nLOOK AT TEXAS. I MEAN, TEXAS, IF YOU HAVE A\nUNIVERSITY OF TEXAS STUDENT I.D., THAT DOESN'T GET YOU A\nBALLOT, BUT IF YOU HAVE A CONCEALED WEAPON PERMIT, THAT\nDOES GET YOU A BALLOT. AND LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE DOING,\nNORTH CAROLINA AND OHIO, THE REPUBLICANS ELIMINATED WHAT'S\nCALLED GOLDEN WEEK. >> GOLDEN WEEK.\n>> THE WEEK YOU COULD REGISTER AND VOTE.\nCREATED BIPARTISANLY BY THE LEGISLATURE, SIGNED BY\nREPUBLICAN GOVERNOR BOB TAFT WHO IS REALLY A REAL MODERATE,\nDECENT REPUBLICAN. HE'S NOT THE RIGHT WING THAT\nTHEY'VE ALL BECOME. THE RIGHT WINGERS THEY'VE\nBECOME. BUT THEY'VE CLAWED ALL THIS\nBACK, SO IN OHIO IT IS A SHORTER WINDOW, A SMALLER WINDOW TO VOTE\nEARLY, BUT THE -- THEY'RE GOING TO BE THERE.\nI MEAN, DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO BE THERE.\nPEOPLE OF COLOR ARE GOING TO BE THERE.\nPEOPLE THAT WANT TO SUPPORT HILLARY ARE GOING TO BE THERE IN\nEARLY VOTING. WE WILL CATCH UP AND DO BETTER,\nIF IN FACT, I'M NOT SURE OF THE NUMBER, IF, IN FACT, WE'RE NOT\nDOING AS WELL AS WE WERE FOUR YEARS AGO.\n>> THAT WASN'T A LEFTY PLOT BY A.C.O.R.N., GOLDEN WEEK WAS JUST\nTHIS IDEA YOU COULD GO REGISTER AND VOTE AT THE SAME TIME, IT\nWAS THE SAME PERIOD OF TIME AND IT WAS GOOD FOR TURNOUT.\nIT WAS GOOD FOR PARTICIPATION. THE REPUBLICANS IN CONTROL OF\nTHE STATE JUST GOT RID OF THAT AND THEY DIDN'T GET RID OF IT\nWITH SOME, ANY ARGUMENT ABOUT VOTER FRAUD.\nTHEY JUST GOT RID OF IT. >> YEAH, AND THERE WAS A CASE\nTHAT WENT TO FEDERAL COURT THEN IT WAS OVERTURNED AFTER ONE OF\nTHESE REGISTRATION -- ONE OF THESE ROLLBACK, CLAWBACK ON\nREGISTRATION ON OPENING UP REGISTRATION, A GEORGE BUSH\nJUDGE VOTED IN FAVOR OF KEEPING THE REGISTRATION MORE OPEN AND\nLIBERAL AND AN APPELLATE CIRCUIT JUDGE, CIRCUIT COURT REVERSED\nIT. YOU'VE SEEN IT, THE SECRETARY OF\nSTATE NOW IN OHIO HAS PURGED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF VOTERS.\nSO WE'RE SEEING THIS EFFORT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.\nAS YOU KNOW, CHRIS, AS YOU POINT OUT IN THE SHOW, FIRST TIME IN\n50 YEARS THE VOTING RIGHTS ABOUT WON'T BE ENFORCED IN STATES\nAROUND THE COUNTRY AND IT'S CLEARLY SUPPRESSING THE VOTE.\nTHE ONLY WAY THEY CAN WIN IS TO DO THAT.\nTHEY KNOW THAT THEIR IDEAS DON'T WORK.\nEVEN IF THEY HAD A BETTER CANDIDATE, THEIR IDEAS AREN'T\nSELLING SO THEY SUPPRESS THE VOTE.\n>> ALL RIGHT.

IT'S NOT ONLY THAT DONALD TRUMP\nHAS BRAGGED ABOUT SERIAL SEXUAL ASSAULT AND NOW BEEN ACCUSED BY\n12 DIFFERENT WOMEN ON THE RECORD.\nHE USED TO RUN BEAUTY CONTESTS, ALL SORTS OF THINGS.\nTHERE'S ALSO THE FIRST WOMEN NOMINEE IN MAJOR PARTY HISTORY.\nHOW MUCH OF THAT WEDGE IS EACH OF THOSE FACTORS IN YOUR MIND?\n>> YOU KNOW WHAT, IT IS -- IT IS REALLY SO HARD TO TELL.\nI'LL TELL YOU, FROM ONE DAY TO ANOTHER I CHANGE MY MIND.\nI WOULD AT FIRST THINK THAT ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE HEARD\nCOME UP WITH DONALD TRUMP WOULD PUSH SO MANY WOMEN TOWARDS\nHILLARY CLINTON, AND WE'VE SEEN THAT, FOR EXAMPLE, WITH\nREPUBLICANS FOR HILLARY CLINTON. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT MICHELLE\nOBAMA AND HILLARY CLINTON ON THE STAGE TODAY AND YOU THINK ABOUT\nTHE NATION'S HISTORY FROM THE FIRST WOMEN'S RIGHTS CONVENTION\nIN SENECA FALLS IN 1848 TO WOMEN BEING ABLE TO GET THE RIGHT TO\nVOTE AND TO GET EQUAL CREDIT AND TO GET AN EQUAL PAY ACT, TO GET\nTHE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT, TO BLACK WOMEN FEELING SORT OF\nLOST IN THE CONVENTIONAL WOMEN'S RIGHTS MOVEMENT IN THE UNITED\nSTATES AND HAVING TO FORM THEIR OWN ORGANIZATIONS AND HERE WE\nHAVE TWO FIRST LADIES, AFRICAN-AMERICAN, WHITE, ONE\nRUNNING FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES, IT IS A\nHISTORIC MOMENT. I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT WOMEN DID\nNOT WATCH THIS SPEECH TODAY AND THINK TO THEMSELVES THAT THEY --\nTHAT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO BE A PART OF HISTORY\nLIKE THEY WERE WITH VOTING FOR BARACK OBAMA IN 2008.\n>> CHARLIE, MICHELLE OBAMA, I SAW HER GIVE -- DO AN EVENT IN\nNEVADA IN THE PRIMARY IN 2008 AND SHE WAS GREAT.\nSHE HAS ONLY -- YOU'VE BEEN COVERING POLITICS FOR A LONG\nTIME. LIKE SHE IS VERY, VERY, VERY\nGOOD AT THIS. >> YEAH.\nI THOUGHT SHE GAVE THE BEST SPEECH AT THE DEMOCRATIC\nNATIONAL CONVENTION BY A COUPLE OF LENGTHS.\nAND THAT WAS A PRETTY GOOD ROW OF SPEAKERS THERE, INCLUDING\nMOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE OUT THERE NOW OPERATING AS\nSURROGATES FOR THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN, WHO IF NOTHING ELSE --\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IF NOTHING ELSE HAS THE 1927 YANKEES OF\nSURROGATES, BECAUSE I SAW ELIZABETH WARREN THE DAY BEFORE\nAND SHE TORE IT UP. BUT I THINK, YOU KNOW, MICHELLE\nOBAMA, I DID NOT SEE HER THAT MUCH DURING THE 2008 CAMPAIGN.\nSHE'S BECOME A VERY GOOD PUBLIC SPEAKER AND A COMPLETELY\nDIFFERENT ONE FROM HER HUSBAND. WHICH I FIND FASCINATING.\nHE'S -- I MEAN HIS -- SHE'S A LITTLE BIT LESS POETIC AND A\nLITTLE BIT -- SHE'S A LITTLE BIT LESS JAZZ AND A LITTLE BIT MORE\nROCK 'N' ROLL THAN HE IS. I MEAN THE EMOTION IS VERY CLOSE\nTO THE SURFACE EVERY TIME SHE SPEAKS.\n>> I FOUND -- I FOUND HER TO BE ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE\nSURROGATES FOR EXACTLY THE REASON CHARLIE IDENTIFIES, JOY.\nFIRST OF ALL, SHE'S IN A UNIQUE POSITION, THE FIRST LADY ALWAYS\nDOES. GENERALLY THEY HAVE HIGH\nFAVORABILITY, THEY'RE SORT OUT OF THE DAILY THRUST OF POLITICS,\nBUT HER AS THE VOUCH -- AS THE PERSON VOUCHING FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON, THERE'S SOME -- WHAT IS IT ABOUT HER VOUCHING FOR HER\nTHAT HAS THE EFFECT IT DOES? >> WELL, MICHELLE OBAMA, FIRST\nOF ALL, IS A FIRST FOR A LOT OF REASONS.\nFIRST LADIES DON'T DO THIS. WHAT SHE'S DOING IS NOT EVEN\nWHAT ELEANOR ROOSEVELT DID. ELEANOR ROOSEVELT WAS PROBABLY\nTHE MOST ACTIVE FIRST LADY WE'VE HAD IN POLITICS UP UNTIL\nMICHELLE OBAMA. SHE DIDN'T DO IT IN 2008 FOR A\nLOT OF OTHER REACHES. BUT WHAT MICHELLE OBAMA DID IN\n2008 WAS TO TAKE HER MAGIC WAND AND TAP BARACK OBAMA FOR BLACK\nPEOPLE. I WAS DOING RADIO BACK THEN.\nA LOT OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS DIDN'T THINK HE WAS AUTHENTIC.\nNAME IS BARACK OBAMA. BLACK PEOPLE SEE PEOPLE WITH\nUNUSUAL NAMES BUT HE HAD EVERYTHING AGAINST HIM.\nNOT REALLY CHICAGO, REALLY HAWAII AND AN EXOTIC FIGURE AND\nI KNOW I WAS DOING A SHOW THAT HAD A MOSTLY BLACK AUDIENCE WHO\nWERE MORE FOR HILLARY THAN BARACK OBAMA.\nTHEN MICHELLE CAME ALONG, TAPPED HIM WITH HER MAGIC AND HE SEEMED\nINSTANTLY AUTHENTIC. SHE SEEMS LIKE YOUR COUSIN, SHE\nSEEMS LIKE SOMEONE YOU KNOW. SHE'S SO REAL.\nSHE'S TAKEN THAT MAGIC AND PUT THAT MAGIC ONTO HILLARY CLINTON.\nSHE CALLED HER MY GIRL. THAT WAS MAGIC FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON. >> THAT IS SUCH A GREAT POINT\nAND THAT HISTORY IS SO LOST IN MANY RESPECTS ABOUT WHAT\nHAPPENED IN 2008 AND PARTICULARLY IN THAT SOUTH\nCAROLINA PRIMARY AND GETTING THERE AND HER BEING ABLE TO SORT\nOF LAYING ON HANDS ROLE THAT SHE PLAYED THEN, REPRISING IT NOW\nFOR HILLARY CLINTON. >> ABSOLUTELY.\n>> MICHELLE BERNARD, JOY REID AND CHARLIE PIERCE, THANK YOU\nFOR STAYING WITH US ON A SOMEWHAT HECTIC NIGHT.\nI APPRECIATE IT. THAT IS \"ALL IN\" FOR THIS\nEVENING. \"THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW\" STARTS\nRIGHT NOW. >> GOOD JOB HANDLING THAT\nBREAKING NEWS. WE HAD OBVIOUSLY NO NOTICE AND\nYOU DID GREAT WITH THAT. >> NOT TO BLOW UP OUR E-MAIL\nCORRESPONDENCE, BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR ON-AIR FACT CHECKS AND\nFACT CONFIRMATION OF SOMETHING I SAID, WHICH I GREATLY\nAPPRECIATED. >> YOU WERE WONDERING IF THERE\nHAD BEEN A PREVIOUS NEWS STORY ABOUT MIKE PENCE'S PILOT.\nTHERE WAS, YOU SENT IT TO YOU. YOU RESPONDED ON AIR.\nWELL DONE, MY FRIEND. >> MY FAVORITE E-MAIL GET, YOU\nWERE RIGHT. >> I'LL SEND YOU ONE EVERY DAY\nFROM HERE ON OUT. THANKS TO YOU AT HOME FOR\nJOINING US TONIGHT. THERE IS A LOT OF NEWS,\nINCLUDING A FEW STORIES THAT ARE STILL DEVELOPING AS WE SPEAK.\nAS CHRIS AND I WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT THERE IN THE LAST HOUR, A\nPLANE CARRYING REPUBLICAN VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE MIKE\nPENCE IN FACT SKIDDED OFF THE RUNWAY AT NEW YORK'S LaGUARDIA\nAIRPORT. NOW, THE IMPORTANT BOTTOM LINE\nHERE IS NOT ONLY GOVERNOR PENCE HIMSELF, BUT EVERYBODY ELSE ON\nTHE PLANE IS SAFE. EVERYBODY IS FINE, THERE WERE NO\nINJURIES. THAT SAID, THE PLANE DID GO OFF\nTHE RUNWAY AND IT CHEWED UP THE RUNWAY PRETTY GOOD OVER THE\nCOURSE OF THIS HARD LANDING. AFTER THE PLANE, THE MIKE PENCE\nPLANE SKIDDED OFF THE RUNWAY AT LaGUARDIA, THE AIRPORT WAS\nACTUALLY CLOSED. LaGUARDIA WAS SHUT DOWN AFTER\nTHAT INCIDENT, SO WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A LIVE REPORT IN JUST A\nMOMENT WITH SOMEONE WHO WAS ON THE PLANE.\nI WILL ALSO REFRESH YOU ON THAT NEWS THAT CHRIS ALLUDED TO LAST\nHOUR, THAT THERE WAS SOME VERY UNUSUAL NEWS THAT WE REPORTED\nJUST ABOUT EXACTLY ONE MONTH AGO ABOUT THE MAP WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY\nBEEN THE PILOT FOR MIKE PENCE'S CHARTER AIRCRAFT OVER THE COURSE\nOF THIS CAMPAIGN. IT'S WEIRD THAT A VICE\nPRESIDENTIAL PLANE MAKES NEWS ONCE, LET ALONE TWICE.\nI'M SURE IT IS COINCIDENTAL, BUT THERE IS A WEIRD HISTORY WITH\nMIKE PENCE'S PLANE AND PILOT, SO WE'LL GET INTO THAT OVER THE\nNEXT LITTLE BIT, INCLUDING, AS I",

      "text": "SAID, A LIVE REPORT.\n>>> IN ADDITION, WE'VE ALSO BEEN TALKING OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS\nABOUT SOME INTERESTING POLITICAL NEWS OUT OF FLORIDA.\nWE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY SOMEWHAT\nINEXPLICABLY PULLING OUT OF THE MARCO RUBIO SENATE RACE IN\nFLORIDA, EVEN THOUGH THAT COULD BE A WINNABLE RACE FOR THE\nDEMOCRATS. WELL, TONIGHT WE'VE GOT NEW\nLATE-BREAKING NEWS THAT THE DEMOCRATS MIGHT BE RECONSIDERING\nTHAT DECISION. THE DEMOCRATS MAY BE JUMPING\nBACK INTO THAT FLORIDA SENATE RACE AGAINST MARCO RUBIO AS OF\nTONIGHT. IT'S VERY LAST MINUTE.\nIT APPEARS TO BE THEM JUMPING BACK IN IN A VERY BIG WAY.\nIT'S INTERESTING, WE'VE GOT DETAILS ON THAT AHEAD.\nWE'VE ALSO GOT TREMENDOUSLY GOOD NAMES TONIGHT CONCERNING THE\nOBAMA FAMILY. IT'S NEWS THAT IS SLIGHTLY MORE\nPERSONAL THAN IT IS POLITICAL, BUT THAT'S AHEAD TONIGHT AS\nWELL. SO THERE'S LOTS -- LOTS COMING\nUP, INCLUDING FOR ONCE SOME NEWS THAT IS MORE GOOD THAN BAD,\nWHICH IS ALWAYS NICE. BUT WE'RE GOING TO START TONIGHT\nWITH SOME NEW TAPE THAT HAS NEVER BEEN HEARD PUBLICLY\nBEFORE. IT'S NEVER BEEN BROADCAST\nBEFORE. WE'RE GOING TO BREAK THIS HERE\nLIVE TONIGHT WITH YOU. AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU, YOU'LL\nBE SURPRISED TO HEAR THIS, BUT THIS NEW TAPE THAT HAS NEVER\nBEEN BROADCAST BEFORE, IT IS TAPE FROM THE GREATEST BASEBALL\nPLAYER IN NEW YORK. >> I WAS THE BEST BASEBALL\nPLAYER IN NEW YORK WHEN I WAS YOUNG.\n>> DO YOU RECOGNIZE THAT VOICE? THAT'S A REMARKABLE THING TO\nHAVE LEARNED TODAY FROM THIS BRAND NEW TAPE THAT'S NEVER BEEN\nBROADCAST BEFORE. IT'S DONALD TRUMP SPEAKING.\nHE SAYS WHEN I WAS YOUNG, SO WE'RE THINKING WE'RE TALKING\nABOUT MAYBE HE WAS 17 OR 16 YEARS OLD, WHEN HE WAS 16 YEARS\nOLD, THAT WAS 1962. THAT'S WHEN THE YANKEES WENT TO\nTHE WORLD SERIES, THEY WON THE WORLD SERIES.\nIT WAS LIKE MICKEY MANTLE, ROGER MARIS.\nEVEN IF YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT BASEBALL, YOU KNOW MICKEY\nMANTLE. BUT IT TURNS OUT NONE OF THEM\nWERE THE BEST BASEBALL PLAYER IN NEW YORK THAT YEAR.\nNO, IT WAS THIS OTHER GUY. >> I WAS THE BEST BASEBALL\nPLAYER IN NEW YORK WHEN I WAS YOUNG.\n>> THIS IS THE BEST TAPE WE'VE GOTTEN OUR HANDS ON IN A VERY\nLONG TIME. THIS IS INCREDIBLE.\nALL RIGHT. THIS IS FROM 2014.\nTHERE IS A PULITZER PRIZE-WINNING REPORTER NAMED\nMICHAEL DANTONIO. IN PREPARING THE BOOK HE DID\nHOURS AND HOURS OF INTERVIEWS WITH DONALD TRUMP, JUST RAW\nFOOTAGE OF THEM TALKING. SOME OF THOSE TAPES HAVE BEEN\nES\" S BEEN DOING A LITTLE BIT OF\nREPORTING ON THEM RECENTLY BUT THEY HAVE NOT PUBLISHED THIS\nAUDIO WE ARE ABOUT TO PLAY. I DON'T TOTALLY WANT TO SPOIL IT\nHERE, BUT ARM CHAIR PSYCHOLOGISTS, START YOUR\nENGINES. THIS IS INCREDIBLE.\n>> I WENT TO MILITARY ACADEMY, NEW YORK MILITARY ACADEMY FOR\nFIVE YEARS, FROM THE YEAR BEFORE FRESHMAN.\n>> SO EIGHTH GRADE ON? >> YES.\n>> WHOSE IDEA WAS THIS? >> WELL, I WAS VERY REBELLIOUS\nAND MY PARENTS THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA.\nI WAS VERY REBELLIOUS. I LOVED TO FIGHT.\nI ALWAYS LOVE TO FIGHT. >> PHYSICAL FIGHTS.\n>> ALL KINDS OF FIGHTS. PHYSICAL.\n>> ARGUMENTS? >> ALL TYPES OF FIGHTS.\nANY KIND OF FIGHT I LOVED IT, INCLUDING PHYSICAL.\nAND I WAS ALWAYS THE BEST ATHLETE, SOMETHING THAT NOBODY\nKNEW ABOUT ME. BUT ONE GUY YOU SHOULD SPEAK TO\nBEFORE IT'S TOO LATE, BECAUSE HE'S A PRETTY OLD GUY NOW, IS\nMAJOR DOBIAS. SO WHEN DOBIAS WAS A DRILL\nSERGEANT IN THE ARMY, AND THESE GUYS WERE ROUGH.\nTHIS GUY WAS SO ROUGH. IN THOSE DAYS, THEY'D SMACK THE\nHELL OUT OF YOU. IT'S NOT LIKE TODAY WHERE YOU\nSMACK SOMEBODY AND YOU END UP GOING TO JAIL FOR THE REST OF\nYOUR LIFE. SO I WENT UP THERE, I'LL NEVER\nFORGET. >> EIGHTH GRADE?\n>> AND I'M STANDING THERE AT MILITARY ACADEMY.\nTHIS GUY COMES UP AND HE'S LIKE A BULLDOG TOO, ROUGH GUY.\nHE WAS A DRILL SERGEANT. NOW THEY CALL HIM MAJOR DOBIAS.\nBUT WHEN I FIRST KNEW HIM HE WAS SERGEANT DOBISA RIGHT RIGHT\nARMY. HE WAS PHYSICALLY ROUGH AND\nMENTALLY ROUGH. HE WAS ALSO MY BASEBALL COACH.\nAND HE SAID THINGS LIKE STAND UP, AND I WENT GIVE ME A\n[ BLEEP ] BREAK. AND THIS GUY CAME AT ME.\nYOU WOULD NEVER BELIEVE IT. IT WAS REALLY FANTASTIC.\n>> DID HE ROUGH YOU UP? >> OH, YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.\n>> GRABBED YOU BY THE SHIRT? >> WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER, BUT\nIT WAS NOT LIKE WHAT HAPPENS TODAY.\nAND YOU HAD TO LEARN TO SURVIVE. IT WAS TOUGH.\nIT WASN'T TODAY. THOSE WERE ROUGHER TIMES.\nTHAT WAS BEFORE VIETNAM AND THESE WERE GUYS THAT DIDN'T TAKE\n[ BLEEP ]. YOU MUST CALL HIM, BEFORE IT'S\nTOO LATE. ASK HIM ABOUT HOW WAS TRUMP AS\nAN ATHLETE? BECAUSE HE SAID -- HE COACHED\nFOR MANY, MANY -- IT WAS LIKE 35 YEARS.\nHE SAID DONALD TRUMP WAS THE BEST ATHLETE I'VE EVER COACHED.\nDONALD TRUMP WAS THE BEST BASEBALL PLAYER I'VE EVER\nCOACHED. YOU KNOW, JUST SOMETHING TO --\n>> WHEN DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE GOOD?\n>> I ALWAYS KNEW I WAS GOOD. I WAS ALWAYS A GOOD ATHLETE.\nI WAS ALWAYS THE BEST ATHLETE. >> LIKE IN FIRST GRADE IF THE\nKIDS THE A GAME -- >> FROM BEFORE THE FIRST GRADE.\nI WAS THE BEST BASEBALL PLAYER IN NEW YORK WHEN I WAS YOUNG.\nNOW, IN THOSE DAYS, YOU KNOW, YOU COULDN'T PLAY BASEBALL\nBECAUSE THERE WAS NO REAL -- YOU KNOW, IT WASN'T A THING.\nPLUS MY FATHER WAS IN THE REAL ESTATE BUSINESS, WHICH I DIDN'T\nWANT TO GO INTO. I WANTED TO GO INTO THEATER.\nI WANTED TO GO INTO SPORTS. BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT WAS VERY\nLIMITED BECAUSE IN THOSE DAYS YOU COULDN'T EVEN MAKE ANY MONEY\nBEING A GREAT BASEBALL PLAYER. >> DIDN'T THE DODGERS TRAIN AT\nWEST POINT A COUPLE TIMES, IN THE SPRING?\n>> EVERYBODY WANTED ME TO BE A BASEBALL PLAYER.\n>> RIGHT. >> BUT I WAS A GOOD AT OTHER\nTHINGS TOO. I WAS GOOD AT WRESTLING.\nI WAS REALLY GOOD AT FOOTBALL. I WAS A GOOD -- I WAS ALWAYS\nGOOD AT SPORTS. I WAS ALWAYS LIKE THE BEST AT\nSPORTS. >> ALWAYS THE BEST.\nAT ALL SPORTS. MY FAVORITE PART OF THAT, I LOVE\nTHE EXPLANATION FOR WHY, YOU KNOW, NOBODY KNOWS EVEN NOW THAT\nHE WAS THE GREATEST BASEBALL PLAYER IN NEW YORK.\nHE SAYS WHEN I WAS YOUNG, I WAS THE BEST BASEBALL PLAYER IN NEW\nYORK WHEN I WAS YOUNG. NOW HE SAYS BUT, YOU KNOW, IN\nTHOSE DAYS, BASEBALL WASN'T REALLY A THING.\nI WAS THE BEST BASEBALL PLAYER IN NEW YORK WHEN I WAS YOUNG.\nNOW IN THOSE DAYS YOU COULDN'T PLAY BASEBALL BECAUSE THERE WAS\nNO REAL, YOU KNOW, IT WASN'T A THING.\nHE SAYS IN THOSE DAYS YOU COULDN'T EVEN MAKE ANY MONEY\nBEING A BASEBALL PLAYER. AGAIN, THE TIME HE'S TALKING\nABOUT HERE IS WHEN HE WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL, LIKE 1962, 1963.",

HAPPENED IN RAINY WINDY WEATHER.\nAPPARENTLY SKIDDED INTO A CONCRETE SUPPRESSIONABLE BED AT\nTHE END OF THE RUNWAY. THAT IS THE REASON NO ONE IS\nHURT. THE PLANE IS YOU HAVE TO RUNWAY\nIN THE CRGRASS. THE GOVERNOR HAS MOVED ON TO HIS\nHOTEL IN NEW YORK. DONALD TRUMP IS IN OHIO ARE\nHOLDING AN VENT TONIGHT. MEAN WHILE THE POLLS ARE\nTIGHTENING. WE'RE GOING BRING BOTH SIDES.\nFLORIDA AND NEVADA ARE BACK IN PLAY.\nSIGNS AS WELL THAT TRULY DEEPLY RED STATES ARE ACTING ALMOST\nBLUE. DAVID CHALIAN IS HERE WITH THE\nLATEST ON ALL OF IT. HE JOINS US NOW.\nLET'S TALK THE ROAD TO 270. THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT\nTHING. >> IT IS.\nAS YOU NOTED WE MADE A COUPLE OF CHANGES IN OUR BATTLEGROUND MAP.\nYOU SEE THAT NEVADA IS BACK IN BATTLEGROUND STATUS AND FLORIDA\nBACK IN BATTLEGROUND STATUS. JUST LAST WEEK WE MOVED THEM\nLEANING CLINTON. WHAT WE LOOK AT IS ADVERTISING\nBUDGETS OF THE CANDIDATE. THE MOST PRECIOUS RESOURCE THE\nCAMPAIGN CAN COMMIT IS THE TIME. SO WE LOOK AT TRAVEL SCHEDULES\nAND OF COURSE THE MOST RECENT POLLS.\nBEFORE HILLARY CLINTON EVEN WRAPPED UP HER TWO DAY FLORIDA\nSWING YESTERDAY HER CAMPAIGN ANNOUNCED SHE'LL BE BACK\nSATURDAY. AND THAT WON'T BE THE LAST TIME.\nNEVADA THEY ARE TIED. SO THOSE STATES HAVE SNAPPED\nBACK TO THEIR BATTLEGROUND STATUS.\nAND I JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU, THAT IS GOOD NEWS FOR DONALD\nTRUMP. HEY, THEY ARE NO LONGER LEANING\nCLINTON. BUT I WANT TO REMIND EVERYONE\nHOW TOUGH THIS MAP IS. LOOK WHERE WE ARE.\n281 TO 179. SHE'S ALREADY OVER THE THRESHOLD\nWITH STATES LEANING IN HER DIRECTION SOLIDLY.\nIF YOU WERE TO GIVE HIM EVERY REMAINING BATTLEGROUND STATE HE\nSTILL DOESN'T GET TO 270. HE ONLY GETS TO 264.\n>> WHAT WOULD HE HAVE TO DO? >> A FEW NEW POLLS OUT TODAY.\nSTARTING IN NORTH CAROLINA, WHERE HILLARY CLINTON WAS TODAY.\nSHE'S SHOWING A FOUR POINT EDGE. 47-43%.\nTHIS IS WHERE SHE WAS WITH MICHELLE OBAMA.\nTHIS IS THE STATE THEY WANT TO RECREATE THE OBAMA COMMISSION\nIN. SHE LOOKS TO HAVE AN EDGE.\nHERE IS ONE OF THE STATES THAT MIGHT BE ACTING DOWNRIGHT BLUE.\nWE'VE NOT SEEN GEORGIA GO DEMOCRATIC SINCE BILL CLINTON'S\nRACE. HE WASN'T EVEN ABLE TO HOLD IT\nIN HIS REELECT. AND CAN CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS NOT\nYET COMMITTED SURROGATE TRAVEL. HILLARY CLINTON IS NOT GOING\nTHERE YET. WE DON'T A SEE A TON OF SPENDING\nGOING ON IN GEORGIA. THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS NOT\nTREATING THAT LIKE A REALLY WINNABLE RACE FOR THEM.\nAND THEN IOWA, WHICH WE ALSO HAVE LEANING TOWARDS DONALD\nTRUMP, A DEAD HEAT. I WAS JUST LOOKING AT EARLY\nVOTING NUMBERS THERE AND HILLARY CLINTON DOES HAVE AN EDGE,\nDEMOCRATS HAVE AN EDGE IN TERMS OF RETURN BALLOTS BUT IT IS NOT\nAS BIG OF APP EDGE AS BARACK OBAMA AT THIS POINT YEARS AGO.\n>> GOOD NEWS FOR THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN BUT ALSO IMPORTANT GOOD\nNEWS FOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, PARTICULARLY IN FLORIDA AND\nNOVA. >> WITHOUT A DOUBT.\n>> LET'S BRING IN THE REST OF THE PANEL.\nVAN JONES IS WITH US. DAVID CHALIAN.\nTRUMP SUPPORTERS KAYLEIGH McENANY AND ANDRE BOWER.\nSO KAYLEIGH, YOU SEE THAT'S GOT TO BE GOOD NEWS FOR YOU, NEVADA\nAND FLORIDA IN PARTICULAR. >> ABSOLUTELY.\nWHAT IT SHOWS ME IS THAT THERE IS SOME MOMENTUM COMING IN\nTRUMP'S DIRECTION. AND I THINK THAT IS BECAUSE, YOU\nKNOW, WE WOKE UP MONDAY TO NEWS ABOUT OBAMACARE PREMIUMS HIKING.\nWE WAKE UP TODAY TO NEWS OF WIKILEAKS.\nMORE CLINTON KRUMGS OR WHAT APPEARS TO BE CLINTON CORRUPTION\nWITH THE FOUNDATION. FINALLY SOME OF THESE THINGS\nTHAT ANDRE AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ARE KIND OF\nBREAKING THROUGH THE NEWS CYCLE BECAUSE TRUMP'S NOT SAYING\nANYTHING THAT IS STEPPING ON HIS MESSAGE.\nHE'S GIVING IT BREATHING ROOM TO GET OUT THERE.\nTHIS MOMENTUM IS IMPORTANT AND IF DONALD TRUMP CAN STAY ON\nMESSAGE AND EMPHASIZE THINGS COMING OUT I THINK HE CAN MOVE\nTHAT MOMENTUM TO THE POINT OF WINNING THE ELECTION.\n>> CARLOS, DO YOU BELIEVE NEVADA AND FLORIDA ARE TIGHTENING\nBECAUSE OF THE DRIP DRIP OF WIKILEAKS AND OTHER THINGS LIKE\nSHE'S TALKING ABOUT? >> I THINK SHE'S RIGHT THAT\nTHERE'S BEEN A SHIFT IN CONVERSATION WHAT.\nSHE'S POINTING TO IS THE EARLY VOTING AND WHAT KAYLEIGH AND\nANDRE WOULD TELL YOU IS THERE ARE A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT THE 7\nOR 8 MILLION VOTES CAST SO FAR. BECAUSE IN MANY STATES HIBBERT\nIS DOING BETTER THAN BARACK OBAMA IN 2012 DID.\nAND IN NORTH CAROLINA AND ARIZONA, PLACES YOU NORMALLY\nWOULD HAVE SEEN MEANINGFUL REPUBLICAN LEAD THERE IS IEGT A\nSLIGHT DEMOCRATIC LEAD OR NARROW ARE REPUBLICAN GAP.\n-- >> ANDRE ARE YOU WORRIED?\n>> LOT OF VOLATILITY THERE BUT I READ TODAY THAT IN FACT THE\nREPUBLICANS HAVE TURNED OUT MORE PEOPLE TO VOTE EARLY THAN THE\nDEMOCRATS HAT. A SUBSTANTIAL MARGIN IN FLORIDA.\nSO THAT IS GOOD NEWS IF YOU ARE PULLING FOR TRUMP BUT AGAIN ALL\nALONG I TALKED ABOUT BREXIT AND HOW PEOPLE SHOWED UP AND TOOK\nTHEIR COUNTRY BACK. AND I THINK YOU ARE GOING TO SEE\nTHE SAME FOLKS THAT DON'T NORMALLY GET OUT AND VOTE.\nTHEY ARE NOT SHOWING IT ON POLLS.\nI GOT IN A CONGRESS RACE THIS SAME WAY.\nPOPPING EVERYBODY. I WON 13 WAYS BUT IN THE RUNOFF\nI GOT BEAT BECAUSE WE ONLY POLLED PEOPLE THAT 140ED UP THE\nFIRST TIME AND THE WHOLE NEW GROUP OF FOLKS CAME OUT IN THE\nRUNOFF. THAT IS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.\n>> DO WHERE HE HAVE DATA ON POLLING WHO'S ACTUALLY COMING\nOUT. >> THE EARLY VOTING.\nTHEIR VOTES AREN'T COUNTED UNTIL ELECTION DAY BUT WE CAN TELL IN\nSOME STATES WHERE IT IS BY PARTY BREAKDOWN THAT DEMOCRATS DO VAN\nEDGE IN EARLY AND ABSENTEE VOTE. WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT IS WE LOOK\nAT STATE BY STATE AND SEE ARE THEY OVERAPPROXIMATE MPERFORMIN\nOR UNDER PERFORMING WHAT OBAMA AND ROMNEY DID IN 2012.\nIT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER AS WE TALK ABOUT STATES TIGHTENING\nMORE. MOMENTUM THAT KAYLEIGH IS\nTALKING ABOUT. IT IS STALE VERY DAUNTING MAP\nFOR DONALD TRUMP. WE CAN'T FORGET THE PAST TO 270,\nAS I SHOWED HE HAS TO SWEEP EVERY BATTLEGROUND STATE AND\nTHEN SO A LITTLE BIT TO IN ORDER TO GET TO 270.\n>> VAN ARE YOU WORRIED? >> I'M SORRY, WHAT DID YOU SAY?\n[ LAUGHTER ] NO I'M NOT PARTICULARLY WORRIED\nTHOUGH I WILL SAY THIS. IF IT IS NOT ZERO PERCENT\nCHANCE, IT IS A CHANCE. AND I THINK ANDRE IS RIGHT.\nTHERE IS -- I WAS JUST IN PENNSYLVANIA.\nI WAS IN INDIANA. I WAS TALKING TO A LOT OF RED\nSTATE VOTERS. A LOT OF TRUMP VOTERS.\nAND THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO FEEL LIKE THIS IS DO OR DIE FOR THEIR\nCOUNTRY. AND WHEN YOU HAVE THAT LEVEL OF\nPASSION. WHETHER WE AGREE WITH IT OR NOT.\nPEOPLE WILL DO EXTRAORDINARY THINGS.\nAND SO IT IS NOT 0% CHANCE, WHICH MEANS THERE IS A CHANCE.\nSO I THINK DEMOCRATS SHOULD BE LESS HAPPY.\nLESS COMPLACENT AND I'M STRUGGLING TO GET THERE.\n>> DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THESE POLLS?\nBECAUSE ANDRE IS BRINGING UP BREXIT.\nTHOSE POLLS SHOWED THEY WEREN'T GOING TO VOTE BREAK AWAY.\n>> I THINK THAT IS A FALSE REALITY THERE WITH THE BREXIT.\n>> YOU THINK U.S. POLLS ARE BETTER THAN THE BRITISH POLLS?\n>> WELL IT IS JUST DIFFERENT. UK AND U.S. ARE TWO DIFFERENT --\nELECTORALLY IT IS TWO DIFFERENT. UK IS MAJORITY WHITE.\nWE ARE MUCH MORE DIVERSE COUNTRY AND I MEAN THERE IS JUST SO MANY\nTHINGS -- >> SO YOU HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE\nPOLLS SHOWING CLINTON. >> WELL HERE AND WHAT I WANT TO\nSAY. FLORIDA AND THE TWO STATES THAT\nWE'RE TALK ABOUT. FLORIDA, PUBLIC POLLING\nUNFORTUNATELY MISSES THE DEMOGRAPHICS WHERE AFRICAN\nAMERICAN NUMBERS SKYROCKETED AND LATINO AND CARIBBEAN AS WELL.\nTHE EARLY VOTING IN FLORIDA LATINOS ARE VOTING AT HIGH\nRECORD NUMBERS AND WHAT'S GOING TO DECIDE THIS RACE IS GOING TO\nBE THE I-4 CORRIDOR. EARLY VOTING I SHOULD SAY.\nI-4 CORRIDOR AND PUERTO RICRICA. DONALD TRUMP --.\nI THINK THAT IS THE KIND OF THE BREAKDOWN OF FLORIDA.\nNEVADA ON THE OTHER SIDE IS AT -- VOTER REGISTRATION FOR\nDEMOCRATS WE ARE AT 90,000 WHICH IS AT PAR WITH 2012.\nAND ALSO ANOTHER ADVANTAGE IS THE LATINO VOTE A WELL.\n>> WE GOT TO TAKE A BREAK. I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY ON THE\nPANEL. MICHELLE OBAMA'S GROUNDBREAKING\nROLE. ONE OF HILLARY CLINTON'S MOST\nPOTENT SURROGATES NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.\nWE'LL SHOW YOU WHAT HAPPENED ON THE ROAD TODAY.\nZ",

VAUGHN, JUST LET US KNOW, WHAT'S\nTHE LATEST? >> Reporter: HEY, CHRIS.\nSO MIKE PENCE IS HEADED BACK TO HIS HOTEL FOR THE EVENING.\nHE HAD A TRUMP TOWER FUND-RAISER TONIGHT THAT HE IS NO LONGER\nGOING TO, BUT HE DID CALL IN TO THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THERE.\nHE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE EARLIER IN THE EVENING, BUT\nBECAUSE OF THE WEATHER HERE IN NEW YORK AT LaGUARDIA, THE\nAIRPLANE WAS NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO COME INTO THE AIRPORT\nAND SO HE WAS ALREADY DELAYED. GOING OFF THE TARMAC MADE IT A\nLITTLE BIT WORSE. BUT HE CALLED INTO THE\nFUND-RAISER AND TALKED TO THE PEOPLE.\nHAIE JACKSON ALSO REPORTED THAT MIKE PENCE TALKED WITH\nDONALD TRUMP IN THE MOTORCADE BACK ON THE WAY TO MANHATTAN.\nHE IS GOING TO BE IN MANHATTAN OVERNIGHT.\nHE'LL BE DOING SOME MORNING SHOWS AS WELL.\nHE'S ON \"MORNING JOE\" IN THE MORNING, OR SO IS THE PLAN NOW.\nTHE CAMPAIGN SAYS THAT A NEW CAMPAIGN PLANE IS ALREADY ON THE\nWAY TO LaGUARDIA, WHICH IT WILL TAKE OFF TOMORROW.\n>> VAUGHN, FOR FOLKS WHO ARE JUST JOINING, CAN YOU JUST TELL\nUS AGAIN WHAT HAPPENED ON THAT PLANE?\n>> Reporter: SURE. SO WE WERE LANDING, AND THIS IS\nNOT THE FIRST TIME WE'VE HAD A BUMPY PLANE.\nWE'VE NEVER GOT OFF THE RUNWAY BEFORE.\nBUT WE WERE FLYING INTO LaGUARDIA THROUGH THE CLOUDS,\nTHROUGH THE RAIN. WE HAD A VERY SUDDEN ROUGH\nIMPACT UPON LANDING, BUT THEN FOR ABOUT TWO, THREE SECONDS, IT\nCONTINUED TO GO DOWN THE RUNWAY. AT THAT POINT IT WAS KIND OF A\nSHARP VEER TO THE RIGHT, IN WHICH THAT'S THE POINT WHERE IT\nREALLY FELT LIKE WE WERE SWERVING OFF THE TARMAC.\nAND THEN THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF IMPACT AS WE WERE GOING\nTHROUGH THE GRASS, WHICH TURNED INTO MUD, AND THAT'S WHEN WE\nREALIZED THAT WE CAME TO A VERY SUDDEN STOP AND REALIZED THAT WE\nWERE IN FACT OFF THE TARMAC. FIRE TRUCKS, AMBULANCES, QUICKLY\nRUSHED TO THE SCENE, THE LIGHTS WENT UP AND WE COULD SEE HOW\nCLOSE, WE SAW SOME SHOTS EARLIER IN WHICH YOU COULD SEE HOW CLOSE\nWE WERE TO THE ROADWAY. THAT'S WHEN IT BECAME REAL.\nWE'VE KIND OF TAKEN IT FOR GRANTED ROUGH IMPACTS ON THE\nPENCE CAMPAIGN PLANE BUT THAT WAS OBVIOUS WHEN YOU SAW THE\nROAD AND THE LIGHTS THAT THIS WASN'T A NORMAL LANDING HERE AT\nLaGUARDIA. >> I'M SO HAPPY YOU'RE SAFE.\nMIKE PENCE TWEETING SO HAPPY EVERYONE ON OUR PLANE IS SAFE.\nGRATEFUL FOR THE FIRST RESPONDERS --\n>> Reporter: THEY WERE THERE QUICKLY.\n>> VAUGHN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANKS FOR THE GREAT WORK\nYOU DID TAKING THAT FOOTAGE AS WELL.\nALL RIGHT. SO DONALD TRUMP IS IN OHIO.\nMIKE PENCE TRAVELING FROM IOWA BACK TO NEW YORK.\nMEANWHILE EARLIER DAY, MICHELLE OBAMA AND HILLARY\nCLINTON ON STAGE TOGETHER FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME AT AN EVENT\nIN NORTH CAROLINA. HERE IS WHAT THAT LOOKED LIKE.\n>> HILLARY DOESN'T PLAY. SHE HAS MORE EXPERIENCE AND\nEXPOSURE TO THE PRESIDENCY THAN ANY CANDIDATE IN OUR LIFETIME.\nYES, MORE THAN BARACK, MORE THAN BILL, AND, YES, SHE HAPPENS TO\nBE A WOMAN. >> JOINING ME NOW, MICHELLE\nBERNARD, PRESIDENT AND CEO FOR THE BERNARD CENTER, JOY REID,\nHOST OF \"A.M. JOY\" RIGHT HERE ON MSNBC AND CHARLIE PIERCE, WRITER\nAT LARGE AT \"ESQUIRE.\" MICHELLE, I WANT TO ASK YOU\nTHIS. THE GENDER GAP WE'VE SEEN OPEN\nUP, HOW MUCH IS THAT GENDER GAP, BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S\nWORKING IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. IT'S NOT ONLY THAT DONALD TRUMP\nHAS BRAGGED ABOUT SERIAL SEXUAL ASSAULT AND NOW BEEN ACCUSED BY\n12 DIFFERENT WOMEN ON THE RECORD.\nHE USED TO RUN BEAUTY CONTESTS, ALL SORTS OF THINGS.\nTHERE'S ALSO THE FIRST WOMEN NOMINEE IN MAJOR PARTY HISTORY.\nHOW MUCH OF THAT WEDGE IS EACH OF THOSE FACTORS IN YOUR MIND?\n>> YOU KNOW WHAT, IT IS -- IT IS REALLY SO HARD TO TELL.\nI'LL TELL YOU, FROM ONE DAY TO ANOTHER I CHANGE MY MIND.\nI WOULD AT FIRST THINK THAT ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE HEARD\nCOME UP WITH DONALD TRUMP WOULD PUSH SO MANY WOMEN TOWARDS\nHILLARY CLINTON, AND WE'VE SEEN THAT, FOR EXAMPLE, WITH\nREPUBLICANS FOR HILLARY CLINTON. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT MICHELLE\nOBAMA AND HILLARY CLINTON ON THE STAGE TODAY AND YOU THINK ABOUT\nTHE NATION'S HISTORY FROM THE FIRST WOMEN'S RIGHTS CONVENTION\nIN SENECA FALLS IN 1848 TO WOMEN BEING ABLE TO GET THE RIGHT TO\nVOTE AND TO GET EQUAL CREDIT AND TO GET AN EQUAL PAY ACT, TO GET\nTHE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT, TO BLACK WOMEN FEELING SORT OF\nLOST IN THE CONVENTIONAL WOMEN'S RIGHTS MOVEMENT IN THE UNITED\nSTATES AND HAVING TO FORM THEIR OWN ORGANIZATIONS AND HERE WE\nHAVE TWO FIRST LADIES, AFRICAN-AMERICAN, WHITE, ONE\nRUNNING FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES, IT IS A\nHISTORIC MOMENT. I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT WOMEN DID\nNOT WATCH THIS SPEECH TODAY AND THINK TO THEMSELVES THAT THEY --\nTHAT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO BE A PART OF HISTORY\nLIKE THEY WERE WITH VOTING FOR BARACK OBAMA IN 2008.\n>> CHARLIE, MICHELLE OBAMA, I SAW HER GIVE -- DO AN EVENT IN\nNEVADA IN THE PRIMARY IN 2008 AND SHE WAS GREAT.\nSHE HAS ONLY -- YOU'VE BEEN COVERING POLITICS FOR A LONG\nTIME. LIKE SHE IS VERY, VERY, VERY\nGOOD AT THIS. >> YEAH.\nI THOUGHT SHE GAVE THE BEST SPEECH AT THE DEMOCRATIC\nNATIONAL CONVENTION BY A COUPLE OF LENGTHS.\nAND THAT WAS A PRETTY GOOD ROW OF SPEAKERS THERE, INCLUDING\nMOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE OUT THERE NOW OPERATING AS\nSURROGATES FOR THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN, WHO IF NOTHING ELSE --\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IF NOTHING ELSE HAS THE 1927 YANKEES OF\nSURROGATES, BECAUSE I SAW ELIZABETH WARREN THE DAY BEFORE\nAND SHE TORE IT UP. BUT I THINK, YOU KNOW, MICHELLE\nOBAMA, I DID NOT SEE HER THAT MUCH DURING THE 2008 CAMPAIGN.\nSHE'S BECOME A VERY GOOD PUBLIC SPEAKER AND A COMPLETELY\nDIFFERENT ONE FROM HER HUSBAND. WHICH I FIND FASCINATING.\nHE'S -- I MEAN HIS -- SHE'S A",

KEEP IN MIND, THAT IT IS\nRAINING IN LAGUARDIA TONIGHT.\nAND THE PLANE APPARENTLY DID SLIDE AS IT WAS LANDING.\nMIKE PENCE WAS DOING CAMPAIGN RALLIES TODAY IN\nTHE BATTLEGROUND STATE OF OHIO.\nTHERE WERE NO INJURIES. EMERGENCY PERSONNEL WILL GO\nTO THE PLANE, MAKE SURE EVERYBODY'S OKAY.\nYOU CAN SEE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OR THE LEFT-HAND\nSIDE OF YOUR SCREEN WHAT APPEARS TO BE STEPS COMING\nOUT. AND, AGAIN, IT'S OUR\nUNDERSTANDING THAT IF THEY HAVE GOTTEN OFF THE PLANE,\nIT WAS ONLY MOMENTS AGO. WE ARE WORKING THE BREAKING\nNEWS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO BRING\nYOU UPDATES ON THIS AS THEY COME IN.\nWE NOW HAVE -- OKAY, WE HAD DAN GALLOW ON THE PHONE.\nWE ARE TRYING TO GET HIM BACK.\nAS SOON AS WE GET HIM BACK, WE'LL BRING THAT TO YOU.\nA LITTLE BIT MORE COMING IN TO US NOW AT THE BREAKING\nNEWS DESK, DAN GALLOW IS ON THE PHONE.\nDAN IS A LOS ANGELES PRODUCER WHO HAS BEEN\nCOVERING THE CAMPAIGN FOR MIKE PENCE.\nDANIEL, IF YOU CAN, I READ THE STATEMENT YOU GAVE US.\nGIVE ME AN IDEA OF WHAT HAPPENED AS YOU WERE COMING\nIN FOR A LANDING. >> WELL, TRACE.\nFIRST OFF I WOULD SAY THIS PLANE HAS KIND OF BEEN KNOWN\nFOR ITS ROUGH LANDINGS. AND I HAVE -- PEOPLE HAVE\nJOKED THAT MAYBE IT WAS A NAVY PILOT AND I THINK NAVY\nPILOTS ARE MAYBE KNOWN FOR LANDING ON CARRIERS THAT ARE\nLITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE\nOR NOT. THAT'S BEEN THE JOKE.\nBECAUSE WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF ROUGH LANDINGS OR FELT LIKE\nWE LANDED MORE THAN ONCE IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.\nSO TONIGHT WHEN WE HIT THE GROUND, IT FELT LIKE -- WE\nJUST WEREN'T SLOWING DOWN. LIKE THE BRAKES WERE REALLY\nJAMMED ON THE WHOLE TIME, THE WHOLE DISTANCE OF THE\nRUNWAY. AND YOU KNOW, YOU COULDN'T\nREALLY SEE OUTSIDE. SO YOU COULDN'T REALLY SEE\nHOW FAST WE WERE GOING OR WHERE WE WERE.\nIN FACT, WHEN WE FINALLY CAME TO A STOP, I COULDN'T\nTELL IF WE WERE ON THE GRASS OR ON THE RUNWAY.\nBUT WE STAYED PUT FOR A GOOD LONG WHILE.\nAND IT KIND OF BECAME OBVIOUS THAT SOMETHING WAS\nASKEW. THE SMELL OF BURNT RUBBER\nWAS VERY OBVIOUS. I WOULD SAY AT SOME POINT AS\nWE WERE LANDING. AND THAT KIND OF TIPPED US\nOFF THAT SOMETHING WASN'T RIGHT.\nAFTER I GUESS MAYBE 2 MINUTES, GOVERNOR PENCE CAME\nBACK AND CHECKED ON ALL OF THE REPORTERS IN THE BACK OF\nTHE PLANE. HE SEEMED TO BE FINE.\nHE SAID HE SAW MUD ON THE FRONT WINDOWS OF THE PLANE.\nAND THAT'S THE FIRST POINT I REALIZED THAT I GUESS WE ARE\nIN THE GRASS AND NOT THE RUNWAY.\n>> YEAH. IT'S AMAZING, DANIEL, AS YOU\nLOOK AT THESE PICTURES, WE ARE LOOKING AT LIVE PICTURES\nNOW OF THE 737 THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ON NOW FOR SEVEN\nMONTHS. I'M CURIOUS, GIVE US AN\nIDEA, DAN, WHEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER FLOWN ON A PRESS\nPLANE BEFORE IT'S NOT EXACTLY THE SAME SETUP.\nYOU DON'T HAVE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS.\nWAS THERE ANYBODY AS YOU CAME IN ON WHAT YOU APPEAR\nTO SAY WAS A HOT LANDING? WAS THERE ANYBODY GIG YOU\nINSTRUCTIONS ON WHAT TO DO OR WHAT WAS HAPPENING AS THE\nPLANE WAS KIND OF SLIDING DOWN THE RUNWAY?\n>> NO, TRACE. I HAVE GOT TO SAY EVERYONE\nTOOK IT ALL AS IT HAPPENS. THERE WASN'T ANYTHING -- YOU\nARE MOVING AT A REALLY FAST SPEED.\nI DON'T THINK THAT A FLIGHT ATTENDANT WOULD HAVE HAD\nTIME OR THE ABILITY TO REACH OVER.\nBECAUSE, YOU KNOW, FOR SEVERAL SECONDS OF\nUNCERTAINTY YOU ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S\nHAPPENING AND IT'S NOT A TIME WHEN PEOPLE ARE GOING\nTO GET OUT OF THEIR SEAT AND START YELLING INSTRUCTIONS\nAT PASSENGERS. THE PLANE BY ITSELF YOU\nMENTIONED A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE NOT BEEN IN PLANE LIKE\nTHIS. IT'S NOT UNLIKE 737 THAT YOU\nHAVE FLOWN. IN ALL KIND OF BUSINESS\nCLASS SEATING. THERE IS MORE SPACE AND\nEVERYTHING. LESS SEATS IN THE PLANE.\nBUT, YEAH, I CAN'T SAY THAT ANYBODY REALLY KNEW WHAT WAS\nHAPPENING UNTIL REALLY TENDED.\nMAYBE PEOPLE WHO KNOW MORE ABOUT FLYING THAN I DO.\nBUT IT WAS A HECK OF AN EXPERIENCE.\n>> AND, DANIEL, AND WHEN YOU SAY WHEN IT ENDED, HOW DID\nIT END? I MEAN, YOU SAY YOU ARE\nGOING DOWN THE RUNWAY AND THEN AT SOME POINT IT\nAPPEARS YOU WENT OFF THE RUNWAY AND HIT SOME MUD.\nSO WHAT WAS THE FEELING LIKE?\nWAS IT A SUDDEN JOLT TO A STOP?\nWAS IT KIND OF A SLOW STOP? WHAT DID IT FEEL LIKES A YOU\nCAME TO THE END OF THAT RUNWAY?\n>> I GUESS -- YOU KNOW, IT'S A LITTLE TOUGH TO REMEMBER\nEXACTLY EVERYTHING. BUT IT FELT LIKE IT WAS A\nPRETTY SUDDEN STOP ONCE WE FINALLY DID COME TO A STOP.\nI DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS WHEELS GETTING STUCK IN THE\nMUD. WE DIDN'T GO THAT FAR OFF OF\nTHE PAVEMENT FROM WHAT I COULD TELL ONCE WE GOT OFF\nTHE PLANE. IT DID APPEAR TO ME AND\nMAYBE YOU CAN SEE IT ON YOUR PICTURES BUT IT APPEARED TO\nME THAT SOME OF THE PAVEMENT WAS BROKEN UP ON THE ACTUAL\nRUNWAY. AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS\nAS A RESULT OF US OR IF THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN THERE.\nFRANKLY, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW THE TARMAC REAL WELL.\nI DON'T KNOW IF THIS WAS -- HOW FAR OFF WE WERE, I DON'T\nKNOW IF WE SLID 20 FEET OR 100 FEET TO BE HONEST WITH\nYOU. I JUST KNOW WE DIDN'T HIT\nTHE TARGET. >> YEAH.\nIT'S FASCINATING AS WE WATCH THESE LIVE PICTURES COMING\nOUT OF LAGUARDIA AIRPORT FROM OUR FOX AFFILIATE THERE\nWNYW, DAN GALLO, STAND BY. I WANT TO UPDATE PEOPLE WHO\nARE JOINING US HOPING TO SEE \"THE O'REILLY FACTOR.\"\nMIKE PENCE, THE G.O.P. NOMINEE HIS PLANE COMING IN\nFROM OHIO HAS SLID OFF THE RUNWAY IN LAGUARDIA.\nA 737. IT WAS COMING IN, AS 737S DO\nAPPROXIMATELY 120, 130 MILES PER HOUR, RAINING IN\nLAGUARDIA AND IT SLID OFF THE RUNWAY.\nDAN GALLO, A PRODUCER FOR FOX NEWS CHANNEL WAS ON\nBOARD THAT PLANE AND QUICKLY, DAN, WE DON'T HAVE\nMUCH TIME LEFT, GIVE ME AN IDEA OF HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE\nON BOARD THAT PLANE AND IF ANYBODY WAS SHAKEN UP, ABOUT\n15 SECONDS, DAN. >> YEAH, TRACE.\nEVERYBODY SEEMED TO BE FINE. EVERYBODY KIND OF SEEMED TO\nBE IN AWE OF WHAT WE HAD JUST GONE THROUGH.\nTHERE IS ROUGHLY MAYBE 40, 45 PEOPLE, INCLUDING SECRET\nSERVICE, CAMPAIGN STAFF, AND THE MEDIA ALONG WITH THE\nFLIGHT STAFF. >> ALL RIGHT.\nDAN GALLO, BACK TO YOU. LISTEN, BREAKING NEWS AS IT\nCOMES IN. WE'LL UPDATE YOU ON THE\nSTORY OUT OF LAGUARDIA AIRPORT.\nMIKE PENCE'S PLANE OFF THE RUNWAY.\n\"THE O'REILLY FACTOR\" NOW.

V.P.\nNOMINEE, HIS PLANE, A 737 COMING IN FROM OHIO HAS SLID\nOFF THE RUNWAY AT LAGUARDIA'S AIRPORT.\nOUR PRODUCER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL'S DAN GALLO WAS ON\nTHE AIRPLANE. WE JUST SPOKE WITH HIM\nMOMENTS AGO. HE SAID IN HIS STATEMENT\nTHAT HE SAID THE PLANE SLID OFF THE RUNWAY.\nIT WAS THE CRAZIEST LANDING HE HAD EVER EXPERIENCED.\nHE SAID THEY SEEMED TO BE SLIDING FOR THE DISTANCE OF\nTHE LANDING AND THE BURNING SMELL BECAME VERY OBVIOUS\nLIKE RUBBER. PENCE CAME BACK TO MAKE SURE\nEVERYONE WAS OKAY. NOBODY'S INJURED.\nPENCE SAID THAT HE SAW MUD ON THE WINDOWS AT THE FRONT\nOF THE PLANE. AGAIN, NOBODY IS INJURED.\nEMERGENCY CREWS DID RESPOND TO THE SCENE.\nEVERYBODY IS NOW OFF BOARD THE AIRCRAFT.\nAND THERE APPEARS TO BE NO DAMAGE TO THE AIRPLANE.\nUPDATES AS THEY COME IN. NOW BACK TO THE O'REILLY\nFACTOR. \u00e2\u0099\u00aa\n>> TRUTH SERUM SEGMENT TONIGHT.\nSOME VERY GOOD NEWS FOR NATIONAL GUARD SOLDIERS WHO\nLIVE IN CALIFORNIA. AS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THE\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MADE A NUMBER OF MISTAKES HANDING\nOUT BONUSES TO SOLDIERS WHO SERVED IN IRAQ AND\nAFGHANISTAN. WHEN THOSE MISTAKES WERE\nUNCOVERED, THE PENTAGON, INCREDIBLY, ORDERED.  SO\nRECIPIENTS OF THE MONEY TO PAY BACK THE BONUSES,\nPUTTING HORRENDOUS BURDEN ON THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES.\nON MONDAY WE TOLD YOU THAT WOULD NOT STAND.\nYESTERDAY, DEFENSE SECRETARY CARTER SAID THIS.\n>> I HAVE ORDERED THE SUSPENSION OF ALL EFFORTS TO\nCOLLECT REIMBURSEMENT FROM AFFECTED CALIFORNIA GUARD\nMEMBERS. AND THAT SUSPENSION WILL\nCONTINUE UNTIL I'M SATISFIED THAT OUR PROCESS IS WORKING.\n>> THAT MEANS THE SUSPENSION WILL CONTINUE FOREVER.\nWITH US HERE IN NEW YORK CITY OUR TRUTH SERUM\nCORRESPONDENCE ERIC SHAWN IN OUR NEWSROOM AND SHANNON\nBREAM. SO WHY DID CARTER CHANGE HIS\nVIEW? DID I FRIGHTEN HIM, ERIC?\n>> BILL, YES. MEDIA PRESSURE.\n\"L.A. TIMES\" BROKE THE STORY.\nCAUSED OUTRAGE. DID YOU A MAJOR SEGMENT ON\nMONDAY. THEN AS YOU NOTED ON\nWEDNESDAY HE SUSPENDS THIS PROGRAM.\nI MEAN, IT'S OUTRAGEOUS, 13600 MEMBERS OF THE\nCALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD GOT THESE BONUSES.\nPENTAGON GOES AFTER 2,000 OF THEM TO CLAW BACK TO GET THE\nMONEY BACK. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT TENS\nOF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS, THEY IMPOSED TAX LIENS, WAGE\nGARNISHMENTS. REALLY PUT PRESSURE.\n42-YEAR-OLD ARMY CAPTAIN INJURED BY IED IN IRAQ.\nHE HAD TO PAY BACK $46,000. IT REALLY WAS.\n>> AND I HOPE THEY GIVE HIM BACK THE MONEY.\nNOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO ON THAT.\nSO HOW LONG WAS THIS OUT OF CONTROL BEFORE THE \"L.A.\nTIMES\" FOUND OUT ABOUT IT. >> THE FIRST REPORT ACTUALLY\nSTARTED BUBBLING UP IN 2010 ABOUT THIS.\nAND IT WASN'T UNTIL REALLY STARTED WITH THE \"L.A.\nTIMES\" REPORT AND YOURS AND OTHER MEDIA REPORTS.\n>> LET'S GIVE THE \"L.A. TIMES\" FULL CREDIT FOR\nBREAKING THE STORY BECAUSE I -- I REACTED OFF THEM.\nSO THIS HAD BEEN GOING ON FOR FIVE OR SIX YEARS BEFORE\nTHE \"TIMES\" GOT INVOLVED AND THEN BROKE IT NATIONALLY,\nRIGHT? >> AND ALSO THAT STARTED\nWITH MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. I TALKED TO DUNCAN HUNTER,\nCONGRESSMAN OF CALIFORNIA. >> HE HAS BEEN VERY GOOD,\nRIGHT. >> HE SAID THIS WAS JUST\nOUTRAGEOUS. HE SAYS SOMETIMES THE\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, HE MAKES HIS WORDS BONE HEADED\nDECISIONS. DUMB DECISIONS.\nHE WANTS TO KNOW WHO EXACTLY, BY NAME, AUTHORIZED\nTHIS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.\nHE DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT THAT YET.\nTHEY ARE CALLING FOR CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS TO\nINVESTIGATE TO SEE ABOUT THIS.\n>> ALL RIGHT. WHERE WE ARE NOW IS NO MORE\nBONUS MONEY IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE PAID BACK.\nBUT THE SOLDIER THAT YOU JUST TOLD ABOUT PAID MORE\nTHAN $40,000 HE HAS TO GET THAT MONEY BACK.\nBECAUSE THAT'S WRONG. SO LET'S KEEP IN THAT AND\nWE'LL TRY TO IRON THE WHOLE THING OUT.\nTHE PENTAGON, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MAKES A MISTAKE.\nTHE SOLDIER SHOULDN'T HAVE TO MAKE THAT MISTAKE.\nERIC, THANK YOU. WE WILL CHECK BACK WITH YOU\nON THE STORY IN A FEW WEEKS. GO OVER TO MS. BREMEN WHO\nHAS BEEN LOOKING INTO WIKILEAKS EXPOSITION SHOWING\nTHAT A CLINTON CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN HAD MULTIPLE\nDINNERS WITH A TOP JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL DURING\nTHE HILLARY CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION.\nWHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT? >> W WELLE L, KALNOW ABOUT\nHN ES PJOTAOD.\nHE IS THE ONE WHO HAS BEEN HACKED BY WIKILEAKS.\nHE IS VERY TIGHT WITH THE CLINTONS.\nTHIS GOES FAR BEYOND JUST HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN.\nHE HAS A LONG HISTORY WITH BILL CLINTON AS WELL.\nWHILE THE INVESTIGATION WAS GOING ON, HE WAS HAVING\nDINNERS AND MEETINGS AND EMAILS WITH PETER, WHO IS A\nJUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL. >> SO PODESTA HIMSELF.\n>> RIGHT. >> WAS HAVING MEETING AND\nDINNERS WITH THIS GUY, CSDZIK IN THE JUSTICE\nDEPARTMENT WHILE HILLARY CLINTON IS ARE SECRETARY OF\nSTATE. >> THIS LOOKS BAD.\n>> WELL, YEAH, FROM THE OUTSIDE IT DOESN'T LOOK\nGOOD. >> WHAT DOES KADZIK DO\nTHOUGH WHAT IS HE. >> HE WASN'T INVOLVED\nDIRECTLY IN LINE WITH THE INVESTIGATION HAPPENING.\nAS THE ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR LEGISLATIVE\nAFFAIRS HE DOES A LOT OF COORDINATION WITH REQUESTS\nTHAT COME IN FROM CONGRESS. THAT INCLUDES A REQUEST WHY\nREPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS WHO WANTED A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR\nAPPOINTED BECAUSE THEY WANTED SOMEBODY FROM THE\nOUTSIDE LOOKING AT THIS AND HE DENIED THAT REQUEST.\n>> SO YOU HAVE GOT LORETTA LYNCH MEETING WITH BILL\nCLINTON. >> ON THE PLANE.\n>> ON THE TARMAC. YOU HAVE GOT THIS JUSTICE\nDEPARTMENT GUY MEETING WITH PODESTA DURING THE\nINVESTIGATION. AND THEN YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF\nFBI STUFF THAT THEY HAVEN'T EXPLAINED AND I DON'T THINK\nTHEY CAN EXPLAIN. SO, IT'S JUST -- NOBODY HAS\nCONFIDENCE IN THIS EXCEPT FOR HILLARY CLINTON SHE HAS\nCONFIDENCE. >> SHE FEELS GOOD.\n>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AMERICANS ENDORSING EITHER\nCLINTON OR TRUMP.

MR. PENCE, KAREN, FIRST LADY,\nWAS GETTING OFF THE PLANE. WE SAW CHARLOTTE PENCE EARLIER,\nTHEIR ELDEST DAUGHTER. HE'S TRAVELING WITH SEVERAL\nCAMPAIGN ADVISERS. YOU JUST SAW HIM GET SOME\nPHOTOGRAPHS WITH SOME OF THE NEAR DEPARTMENT HERE.\nAGAIN, TO BE CLEAR, THERE'S NO INJURIES.\nEVERYBODY WAS FINE, BUT AS WE ZOOM BACK OUT OVER, YOU'LL SEE\nHERE WHERE THE PLANE IS, COMPARED TO -- AND THE\nRESPONSE -- WE SAW THOSE LIGHTS IMMEDIATELY.\nAND I WAS ACTUALLY HEARING THAT THERE WAS ORIGINALLY REPORTS, WE\nWERE ON THE PLANE, SOMEBODY HAD SAID THAT THEY HEARD THERE WAS A\nREPORT THAT A PLANE HAD GONE OFF THE RUNWAY BUT NOT REALIZING\nTHAT THAT WAS THE PLANE THAT WE WERE ON.\nAGAIN, THIS IS THE PLANE THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS RIDING SINCE\nJULY. IT'S A 737.\nTHOSE OF US WHO RIDE ON THE PENCE PLANE LIKE TO THINK IT'S A\nNICE PLANE BUT I'M NOT SURE WHEN THIS GUY WILL BE GETTING BACK UP\nAND GOING AGAIN. WE'RE GOING TO FAST FORWARD\nHERE, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE MORE STAFF AND FIRE DEPARTMENT\nGETTING OFF THE PLANE. >> VAUGHN, YOU HAD SAID THAT YOU\nGUYS HAD SOME BUMPY LANDINGS ON THAT PLANE.\nAM I RECALLING CORRECTLY, THE CAPTAIN, THE MAN WHO HAD PILOTED\nTHE PENCE PLANE EARLY ON WAS REPLACED AT SOME POINT?\nIS THAT RIGHT? >> THAT IS -- YES.\nWE'VE ACTUALLY HAD SEVERAL PILOTS.\nI'M NOT SURE THE EXTENT I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO.\nI DON'T KNOW THE EXTENT. THERE'S PILOTS THAT ROTATE IN\nAND OUT THAT FLY THE 737, THE CAMPAIGN PLANE.\nI'M IS NOT SURE, TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST, WHO IS PILOTING THIS\nTIME AROUND. THE GOVERNOR DID SAY WHEN HE\nCAME BACK TO THE BACK OF THE PLANE, THEY WERE ABLE TO SEE\nINSIDE THE COCKPIT AND THERE WAS ACTUALLY MUD ON THE FRONT WINDOW\nWHICH WAS OUR FIRST INDICATION WE WERE, IN FACT, DEFINITELY OFF\nTHE RUNWAY BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR, HIMSELF, SAID THERE WAS MUD.\nI DON'T KNOW THE EXTENT TO THIS PILOT -- I DON'T WANT TO JUMP TO\nCONCLUSIONS. >> OF COURSE.\n>> THE PLANE -- THIS ISN'T -- OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A SPECIALIST,\nA COMMERCIAL AIRLINER. THIS IS NOT JUST A ONE-TIME\nTHING. IT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN THE PAST.\n>> WILL YOU JUST TELL ME RIGHT NOW, WE GOT SOME IMAGES OF FIRST\nRESPONDERS, I THINK OBVIOUSLY THERE'S POLICE, THERE'S FIREMEN,\nTHERE ARE SECRET SERVICE, OF COURSE.\nTHERE'S THE SECRET SERVICE STAFF THAT TRAVELS WITH THE GOVERNOR\nAT ALL TIMES. ABOUT HOW MANY FOLKS ARE IN THAT\nDETAIL? >> WITH THE SECRET SERVICE\nDETAIL, THERE'S PROBABLY ABOUT 15 OF THEM THAT ARE ON THE\nPLANE. AGAIN, AT THE FRONT OF THE\nPLANE, THERE ARE ABOUT FOUR -- THREE, FOUR ROWS -- YEAH, FOUR\nROWS IN WHICH CAMPAIGN STAFF INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR, MRS.\nPENCE AND CHARLOTTE PENCE, THEIR DAUGHTER, RIDE ON, AND THEN\nBEHIND THEM IS ABOUT EIGHT ROWS OF SECRET SERVICE AND THEN\nBEHIND THEM IS WHERE THE PRESS SITS.\nAND AS YOU SEE, I MEAN, THIS IS A -- IT LOOKS LIKE A PRETTY\nSTANDARD PLANE. TWO SEATS ON EACH SIDE OF THE\nROWS. AND, AGAIN, IMMEDIATELY THE\nGOVERNOR GOT UP, MADE SURE THAT EVERYBODY WAS OKAY.\nBUT, YEAH, NO, THIS WAS PROBABLY ABOUT 30, 40 PEOPLE THAT WERE ON\nTHE PLANE. >> AND THAT'S -- AND SO IT'S\nACTUALLY NOT THAT HUGE A STAFF THE GOVERNOR A TRAVELING WITH AT\nTHIS POINT. >> NO, NO.\nTHE GOVERNOR IS TRAVELING -- SO THE GOVERNOR, MRS. PENCE,\nCHARLOTTE PENCE, ADVISER MARK SCHWARTZ, MICHAEL GLASSNER WHO\nWAS AN ORIGINAL FROM THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WAS ON THE PLANE TODAY.\nHE TYPICALLY DOES NOT TRAVEL WITH THE PENCE CAMPAIGN, BUT HIS\nLUCKY DAY. TODAY'S THE DAY THAT HE JUMPED\nON THE PLANE. MINDAEL GLASSNER, MIKE WATER,\nTHE PRESS SECRETARY FOR THE GOVERNOR, YOU HAD JORDAN CAREM,\nTHEIR TRAVEL DIRECTOR. BOBBY WHO IS THEIR TOUR LEAD.\nAND ZACH BOWER, SPECIAL ADVISER AND BODY MAN FOR THE GOVERNOR.\nTHAT'S PRETTY MUCH HIS CORE -- THE CHAIR OF THE CAMPAIGN WAS\nNOT ON THE PLANE, BUT WE'RE 11 DAYS OUT, HE WAS DOING A NEW\nYORK CITY FUND-RAISER TONIGHT THEN HE WAS GOING TO BE LEAVING\nTOMORROW. HE'S ACTUALLY DOING -- HE'S\nACTUALLY GOING TO BE ON, IF I MAY PROMOTE, HE'S GOING TO BE ON\n\"MORNING JOE\" TOMORROW AS WELL AS CNBC'S \"SQUAWK BOX.\"\nWE'LL BE HEARING MORE FROM HIM TOMORROW FOR SURE.\nPOOR CONTINGENCY. YOU'RE SEEING THE AIRLINE\nATTENDANTS THAT ARE THERE THAT ARE GOING OUT HERE.\nHOLD ON ONE SECOND. I'M GOING TO TURN DOWN MY AUDIO.\nSORRY ABOUT THE -- WE'RE TRYING TO OPERATE THE CAMERA.\n>> VAUGHN, I'M GOING TO ACTUALLY LET YOU GO AND KEEP THAT CAMERA\nBECAUSE JUST SO FOLKS KNOW, VAUGHN RIGHT NOW IS\nMULTITASKING. HE'S OPERATING THE CAMERA,\nVISION THAT YOU'RE SEEING AS HE'S TALKING TO ME.\n>> YEAH. >> AT THE SAME TIME.\nI'M GOING TO LET YOU TRY TO MAYBE GET SOME MORE INFORMATION\nAND HOLD THAT -- THE POOL CAMERA THERE.\nI'M GOING TO BRING IN NBC'S TOM COSTELLO WHO I BELIEVE WEHAVE\nON THE PHONE AT THIS MOMENT JUST TO GIVE A SENSE, OBVIOUSLY, THE\nDETAILS OF WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED HERE, WE ARE STILL TRYING TO\nTRACK DOWN. HOW OFTEN DOES SOMETHING LIKE\nTHIS GENERALLY HAPPEN, TOM? >> WELL, LISTEN, HAVING A PLANE\nCOMING IN, I'M WATCHING THE VIDEO COME IN AS WELL, YOU KNOW,\nTHEY'VE CLEARLY GOT A VERY RAINY, DIFFICULT WEATHER NIGHT\nTHERE IN NEW YORK. AND WHENEVER YOU'RE COMING IN ON\nA LANDING, AND KEEP IN MIND, A 737 IS GOING TO COME IN\nSOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF 155 MILES PER HOUR OR SO,\nASSUMING THIS IS A 737 300. AND LaGUARDIA ALREADY IS KNOWN\nAS A CHALLENGING AIRPORT. WHENEVER YOU COME IN FOR A\nLANDING BECAUSE IT'S RIGHT THERE, AS YOU KNOW, SITTING\nRIGHT ON THE WATER. AND SO WHEN YOU ARE DEALING WITH\nCOMING IN AT 155 MILES PER HOUR ON A RAIN-SLICK RUNWAY, THESE\nTHINGS CAN HAPPEN. YOU KNOW, WE GET REPORTS OF\nPLANES OFF THE END OF THE RUNWAY ACROSS THE COUNTRY.\nI'D SAY PROBABLY ALMOST ONCE EVERY WEEK OR TWO.\nSOMEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY. AND IT HAPPENS SO OFTEN, YOU\nKNOW, WE JUST DON'T EVEN -- IT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE NEWS VERY\nOFTEN BECAUSE FOR THE MOST PART, THEY SLIDE INTO THE MUD AND\nNOBODY IS INJURED AND YOU HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE ASKING QUESTIONS\nABOUT HOW THIS HAPPENED. AND WHAT WILL HAPPEN NOW, OF\nCOURSE, IS YOU'LL HAVE BOTH THE FAA AND PROBABLY THE NTSB, BUT\nSURELY THE FAA WILL TAKE A LOOK AT EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED IN THE\nCOCKPIT, HOW FAST WAS THE PILOT COMING IN, DID HE OR SHE HIT\nTHAT RUNWAY EARLY ENOUGH? OR DID THEY HIT IT TOO LATE?\nAND AS A RESULT, DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH RUNWAY SPACE AT THE END?\nBUT THE CHANCES ARE -- >> DID WE LOSE TOM THERE?\nSOUNDS LIKE WE MAY HAVE LOST TOM ON THE AUDIO THERE.\nTHAT'S LIVE FOOTAGE RIGHT NOW FROM THE RUNWAY, IF YOU'RE JUST\nJOINING US, LaGUARDIA AIRPORT, WHERE THE CHARTER PLANE, THE 737\nTHAT FLIES GOVERNOR OF INDIANA MIKE PENCE, OF COURSE, THE\nREPUBLICAN V.P., JUST SKIDDED OFF THE RUNWAY DURING A ROUGH\nLANDING. YOU CAN SEE THERE, THE PLANE UP\nIN THE UPPER LEFT HAND CORNER OF THAT SCREEN, THAT GRASSY FIELD\nTHERE IS WHERE THE PLANE ENDED UP STOPPING.\nNOT TOO FAR FROM THE FENCE THAT MARKS THE END OF THE AIRPORT.\nSO A PRETTY SCARY LANDING FOR THE FOLKS, 30-PLUS THAT WERE ON\nTHAT PLANE THAT INCLUDES THE GOVERNOR, HIS WIFE, THEIR\nDAUGHTER, CHARLOTTE, AS WELL AS ABOUT 15 SECRET SERVICE AND\nABOUT A DOZEN MEMBERS OF THE PRESS CORPS INCLUDING OUR OWN\nVAUGHN HILLYARD WHO AT THE MOMENT IS DIRECTING THAT CAMERA\nAMIDST THE SOMEWHAT CHAOTIC AND RAINY SCENE ON THE RUNWAY IN\nLaGUARDIA. LET ME BRING IN A.J. DELGADO,\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER. WELL, VERY HAPPY EVERYONE'S\nOKAY. >> ABSOLUTELY.\nALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL, BUT CERTAINLY A SCARY SITUATION.\nI MEAN, THIS KIND OF MAKES YOU REALIZE HOW MUCH GOVERNOR PENCE\nAND ALL CANDIDATES REALLY PUT THEMSELVES OUT THERE, INCLUDING\nEVEN THEIR SAFETY WITH THIS CONSTANT TRAVEL.\nIT'S A GRUELING SCHEDULE THAT THEY ALL HAVE, INCLUDING EVEN\nSECRETARY CLINTON. >> YEAH.\nIT IS, THE AMOUNT OF TRAVEL THAT GOES ON TO A MODERN CAMPAIGN IS\nPRETTY REMARKABLE. GENERALLY, CAMPAIGNS HAVE, YOU\nKNOW, LARGE CHARTERED PLANES LIKE THIS ONE, A 737.\nTHIS IS NOT AN ISLAND HOPPER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.\nTHESE ARE SIGNIFICANT -- SIGNIFICANT PIECES OF AIRCRAFT\nTHAT THEY USE TO GET AROUND. THAT'S A HUGE SORT OF ALMOST\nTRAVELING UNIVERSE. I'M SURE YOU'VE BEEN -- YOU'VE\nBEEN ON TRUMP FORCE ONE, OF COURSE.\n>> YES. >> AND, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE IS\nTHIS SORT OF WEIRD MOBILE VILLAGE THAT KIND OF GROWS UP\nAMIDST THE CAMPAIGN WITH EVERYONE FROM PEOPLE FROM ALL\nDIFFERENT VECTORS, CAMPAIGN STAFF, THE CANDIDATE, SECRET\nSERVICE, PRESS, EVERYBODY SORT OF THROWN INTO VERY INTIMATE\nQUARTERS AND THEY SPEND A LOT OF TIME TOGETHER.\n>> RIGHT. IT'S A MOTLEY CREW KIND OF\nENTOURAGE AND WITH STAKES THAT ARE VERY HIGH.\nIT'S AN INTERESTING EXPERIENCE ON THESE PLANES.\nESPECIALLY TONIGHT. GLAD TO SEE EVERYBODY'S OKAY.\n>> VAUGHN HILLYARD HAS A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION.\nVAUGHN, YOU THERE? >> YES, I AM.\n>> SO WHAT'S GOING ON NOW? >> YEAH, SO OUR SHOT HERE, WE\nARE THE MARINE -- WE'RE GETTING OUT OF THE -- WE'RE LEAVING THE\nMARINE AIR TERMINAL, SO THE MOTORCADE IS NOW LEAVING.\nMIKE PENCE IS NO LONGER GOING TO HIS FUND-RAISER.\nTHE MOTORCADE HERE HAS TAKEN OFF, SO MIKE PENCE IS NO LONGER\nGOING TO THE FUND-RAISER. WE JUST TALKED TO MARK LAUDER, A\nSPOKESMAN, HE SAID, YES, THERE WERE NO INJURIES.\nHE SAID THAT PORT AUTHORITY IS LOOKING INTO IT.\nEVERYBODY WAS ON SCENE QUICKLY. NOW YOU'RE GOING TO GET A SHOT\nHERE IN WHICH THIS IS -- WE'RE NOW BEING TAKEN AWAY.\nI THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE FOLLOWING THE MOTORCADE HERE.\nARE WE GOING TO BE FOLLOWING THE MOTORCADE?\nNO. SO MIKE PENCE, WE'RE NOT SURE\nEXACTLY NOW WHERE HE'S GOING. WE'LL WORK ON GETTING THAT\nINFORMATION. HE HAD ORIGINALLY, A FUND-RAISER\nFOR THIS EVENING PLANNED. THEY SAID THEY ARE GOING TO\nRESCHEDULE THE FUND-RAISER. IT WAS GOING TO BE AT TRUMP\nTOWER. WE HAD A CAMERA THERE WAITING\nFOR THE GOVERNOR ONCE HE ARRIVED, BUT HE'S NO LONGER\nGOING. I GUESS AFTER ALL OF THIS HAS\nTAKEN PLACE, THE CAMPAIGN SAYS THAT THEY'LL RESCHEDULE IT.\n>> I THINK THAT PROBABLY MAKES SENSE.\nALL RIGHT. VAUGHN HILLYARD WHO DID\nINCREDIBLE WORK TONIGHT. THANK YOU, VAUGHN, FOR ALL OF\nTHAT. I'M GLAD YOU'RE SAFE.\nI'M GLAD EVERYONE'S SAFE. LOOKS LIKE YOU ARE PULLING OUT\nOF THE AIRPORT THERE FROM WHAT I CAN TELL FROM THAT LIVE SHOT IN\nTHE BACK OF THAT CAR. VAUGHN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nWE'RE GOING TO TAKE A SHORT BREAK.\nWE'LL BE BACK WITH MUCH MORE. DON'T GO ANYWHERE.",

EARLIER, TRUMP CLAIMED MOMENTUM\nIN THE RACE SAYING POLLS SHOW HIM WITH LEADS IN BATTLEGROUND\nSTATES ACROSS THE ELECTORAL MAP. >> WE DON'T WANT TO TAKE IT FOR\nGRANTED, BUT WE ARE WINNING IN A LOT OF STATES.\nI HAVE TO SAY, THE MEDIA NOW, THEY'RE GOING WILD.\nTHE MEDIA'S GOING WILD BECAUSE THEY'RE SAYING, YOU KNOW, THIS\nGUY'S WINNING. IN FLORIDA.\nHE'S WINNING IN NORTH CAROLINA. HE'S WINNING IN IOWA.\nHE'S WINNING IN OHIO. >> THE MEDIA ISN'T QUITE SAYING\nTHAT. WELL, A RASH OF NEW POLLS\nSUGGEST THE RACE HAS TIGHTENED SLIGHTLY, IN RECENT DAYS HILLARY\nCLINTON CONTINUES TO HOLD THE LEAD OVER TRUMP NATIONALLY, AND\nA CLEAR LEAD IN ENOUGH BATTLEGROUND STATES AT THIS\nMOMENT TO PUT HER OVER THE TOP. ADJUSTED NATIONAL POLLING\nAVERAGE, NATE SILVER'S 538, SHOWS CLINTON WITH A SIX-POINT\nLEAD OVER TRUMP OVERALL. ADJUSTED STATE POLLING AVERAGES\nSLOW CLINTON WITH LEADS IN ALL FOUR OF THE STATES TRUMP\nMENTIONED ALTHOUGH THE RACE IS EFFECTIVELY A DEAD HEAT TIED IN\nIOWA AND OHIO. CRUCIALLY IN PENNSYLVANIA, A\nSTATE TRUMP DESPERATELY NEEDS TO WIN, HE'S DOWN MORE THAN 6 1/2\nPOINTS IN 538'S ADJUSTED POLLING AVERAGE.\nTHE RACE IS TIED IN ARIZONA, A STATE THAT SHOULD BE A LAY-UP\nFOR A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE.\nREFUSING TO ADMIT PUBLICLY HE'S DOWN, TRUMP IS SUGGESTING\nCLINTON'S POLICIES ARE SO BAD, MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE AN\nELECTION. >> THINKING TO MYSELF RIGHT NOW,\nWE SHOULD JUST CANCEL THE ELECTION AND JUST GIVE IT TO\nTRUMP, RIGHT? WHAT ARE WE HAVING IT FOR?\n>> IN CASE IT WASN'T CLEAR FROM THE CONTEXT, THAT WAS A JOKE.\nTHE CANDIDATE DAYDREAMS OF THAT, HIS STUFF STAFF IS GRAPPLING\nWITH THE PICTURE THEY FACE IN THE REAL WORLD.\nBLOCKBUSTER NEW PIECE IN YT BLOOMBERG BUSINESS WEEK,\" IT'S\nREPORTED THAT TRUMP'S SAN ANTONIO RESEARCH TEAM SPENDS\n$100,000 A WEEK ON SURVEYS AND SOPHISTICATED MODELS THAT RUN\nDAILY SIMULATIONS OF THE ELECTION.\nAS A RESULT, TRUMP'S STAFF KNOWS HE'S LOSING BADLY.\n\"NATE SILVER'S RESULTS HAVE BEEN SIMILAR TO OURS\" SAYS TRUMP\nPOLITICAL DIRECTOR \"EXCEPT THEY LACK BY A WEEK OR TO TWO.\"\nUSING TARGETED FACEBOOK POSTS  IDEALISTIC WHITE LIBERALS, YOUNG\nWOMEN AND AFRICAN-AMERICANS. SENIOR OFFICIAL IN THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN DESCRIBED THIS EFFORT BY TELLING \"BLOOMBERG,\" \"WE HAVE\nTHREE MAJOR VOTER SUPPRESSION OPERATIONS UNDER WAY.\"\nWHAT HE SEEMS TO BE TALKING ABOUT IS NEGATIVE CAMPAIGNING TO\nDEPRESS TURNOUT, NOT WHAT IS COMMONLY CALLED VOTER\nSUPPRESSION. WITH CLINTON BY HER SIDE IN\nNORTH CAROLINA TODAY, MICHELLE OBAMA LAMBASTED THE TRUMP CAMP'S\nEFFORT TO DEPRESS TURNOUT WHICH SHE SAID INCLUDED TRUMP'S CLAIMS\nTHE ELECTION IS RIGGED. >> IF HILLARY DOESN'T WIN THIS\nELECTION, THAT WILL BE ON US. IT WILL BE BECAUSE WE DID NOT\nSTAND WITH HER. IT WILL BE BECAUSE WE DID NOT\nVOTE FOR HER. AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HER\nOPPONENT IS HOPING WILL HAPPEN. THAT'S THE STRATEGY.\nTO MAKE THIS ELECTION SO DIRTY AND UGLY THAT WE DON'T WANT ANY\nPART OF IT. >> IF TRUMP DOES LOSE THIS\nELECTION, DON'T EXPECT HIM TO GO AWAY QUIETLY.\n\"BLOOMBERG\" REPORTS BY ELECTION DAY TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN EXPECTS TO\nHAVE GOTTEN E-MAIL ADDRESSES, SMALL DONORS POIED UP $275\nMILLION. COULD BECOME THE AUDIENCE FOR A\nNEW MEDIA VENTURE OR BACKBONE FOR A THIRD PARTY POLITICAL\nMOVEMENT AND FORCE THE GOP TO CONFORM TO TRUMPISM INSTEAD OF\nMOVING AWAY FROM A CANDIDATE WHO LOST.\nIN THE WORDS OF TRUMP'S DIGITAL DIRECTOR, \"WE OWN THE FUTURE OF\nTHE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\" JOINING ME NOW, CO-AUTHOR OF\nTHAT PIECE, \"BLOOMBERG BUSINESS WEEK'S\" JOSH GREEN.\nTO SOME EXTENLT, I THINK THE STORY ABOUT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN\nIS THEY'RE BASICALLY WINGING IT AND THIS WAS A WINDOW INTO THE\nFACT THAT THEY MAY BE WINGING IT IN CERTAIN WAYS BUT THERE IS\nALSO AN ACTUAL ORGANIZATION THERE DOING SOME OF THE STUFF\nTHAT CAMPAIGNS TYPICALLY DO. >> YEAH, I MEAN, THAT WAS A REAL\nTAKEAWAY TO ME. I THINK THE REASON THEY\nCOOPERATED WITH THIS PIECE WAS THAT THEY WERE LITTLE MIFFED AT\nTHE IDEA THAT THEIR CAMPAIGN IS REALLY NO MORE THAN TRUMP AND\nHIS TWITTER FEED AND THEY HAVE, IN FACT, BUILT A PRETTY\nAMBITIOUS DATA OPERATION DOWN IN SAN ANTONIO, THEY CO-NAMED IT\nPROJECT ALAMO, AND THEY BASICALLY SHOWED OFF ALL THE\nBELLS AND WHISTLES WHICH WHILE IT MAY NOT RESEMBLE A\nTRADITIONAL CAMPAIGN, HAS TURNED INTO A REAL MONSTER SMALL-DOLLAR\nFUND-RAISING MACHINE, WHICH IS ALLOWING TRUMP TO BUILD UP THIS\nREALLY VALUABLE THIS, THIS AUDIENCE OF DONORS THAT\nCONCEIVABLY CAN BE TRANSPORTED OVER TO TRUMP TV NETWORK OR SOME\nNEW SOCIAL MEDIA PLAY, IF HE DOESN'T WIN THE ELECTION, OR IF\nHE DOES WIN THE ELECTION, HE'S GOT A BIG LIST OF SUPPORTERS\nBACKING HIM UP. >> YEAH, THERE'S A NUMBER OF\nBERNIE SANDERS, EX-SANDERS FUND-RAISING AND DIGITAL TEAM\nFOLKS THAT ARE KNOW OR FOLLOW ON TWITTER AND THEY HAVE BASICALLY\nLOOKED AT THIS OPERATION BEING BUILT IN REALTIME AND THEY BUILT\nAN INCREDIBLE OPERATION, OBVIOUSLY.\nIT'S WHAT SORT OF POWERED THAT CAMPAIGN IN CERTAIN WAYS, AND\nTHEY SAY THE METRICS THAT THEY'VE HIT IN TERMS OF THE\nNUMBER OF DONORS THEY HAVE, THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY'RE ABLE TO\nBRING IN, IS REALLY REMARKABLE IN THE SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THEY\nCONSTRUCTED IT. >> IT REALLY IS REMARKABLE WHAT\nTHEY'VE DONE, AND I THINK THE MOST INTERESTING GUY IN THE\nWHOLE STORY IS THIS GUY, BRAD PARSCALE, HE WE PROFILE,\nESSENTIALLY ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL PEOPLE IN THE TRUMP\nORGANIZATION. CRAZY STORY.\nHE USED TO BUILD WEBSITES FOR TRUMP'S REAL ESTATE PROPEIES\nAND THE TRUMP WINERY. TRUMP TRUSTS HIM.\nHE LIKES HIM. HE GETS A LOT DONE.\nEVENTUALLY AS VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, COREY\nLEWANDOWSKI, PAUL MANAFORT GOT FIRED, LEFT, PARSCALE GOT MORE\nAND MORE AUTHORITY AND BUILT THIS MACHINE THROWING OFF ALL\nTHESE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.\n>> IT'S ALSO INTERESTING HE SAID TO YOU, YEAH, OUR NUMBERS ARE\nTHE SAME AS NATE SILVER'S WITH A TWO-WEEK LAG.\nTHAT WAS A SORT OF AMAZING MOMENT OF HONESTY AND CLARITY.\n>> WELL, THEY HAVE BUILT SOPHISTICATED DATA MODELS.\nI MEAN, THEY HIRED THE CAMBRIDGE  AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS DOING\nTHIS STUFF. THEY HAVEN'T REALLY SAID THIS TO\nTHE PRESS, SO I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY IT'S SO\nSURPRISING, BUT LOOK, IF YOU PUT GOOD SCIENTISTS IN A ROOM AND\nYOU USE GOOD POLLS AND CRUNCH THE NUMBERS RIGHT, YOU'RE GOING\nTO COME OUT WITH I WOULD ASSUME A MORE OR LESS ACCURATE PICTURE\nOF THE ELECTION. >> RIGHT.\n>> AND THE NUMBERS THEY SHOWED US DID NOT DIFFER DRAMATICALLY\nFROM THE KIND OF NUMBERS YOU SEE FROM GOOD PUBLIC FORECASTERS\nLIKE NATE SILVER. THE ONLY POINT THAT THE TRUMP\nPEOPLE MADE WAS, LOOK, WE'RE OUT THERE EVERY NIGHT MAKING\nTHOUSANDS OF CALLS IN ALL THESE BATTLEGROUND STATES.\n>> RIGHT. >> WE SEE SEE THIS HAPPENING IN\nREALTIME. >> YES.\n>> A LOT OF THESE PUBLIC GUYS HAVE A TWO-WEEK LAG.\n>> EVERYBODY WHO WORKS INSIDE CAMPAIGNS THINK PUBLIC POLLS ARE\nINCREDIBLY PA SAY BECAUSE THEY GET THE DATA EVERY NIGHT IN REAL\nTIME. JOSH GREEN, THANKS FOR YOUR\nTIME. >> THANK YOU.\n>> I WANT TO CHECK IN WITH NBC'S HALLIE JACKSON WHERE TRUMP IS\nABOUT TO TAKE THE STAGE. I UNDERSTAND TRUMP CALLED\nGOVERNOR PENCE TO CHECK IN AND MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WAS OKAY.\n>> Reporter: THAT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING, CHRIS.\nHE WAS IN THE MOTORCADE, HE LANDED IN CLEVELAND BASICALLY AT\nONE OF THE AIRPORTS IN THE CITY, LIKE A 50-MINUTE DRIVE TO\nGENEVA, OHIO, WHERE WE ARE NOW. AT SOME POINT ON THAT MOTORCADE\nWE ARE TOLD BY A SPOKESPERSON THAT DONALD TRUMP CALLED\nGOVERNOR PENCE TO CHECK IN TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE WAS OKAY.\nSAID HE WAS OBVIOUSLY HAPPY THAT EVERYBODY WAS SAFE.\nSO THAT IS SORT OF WHAT YOU MIGHT EXPECT FROM THE TOP OF THE\nTICKET WITH THE RUNNING MATE WHEN AN INCIDENT LIKE THIS\nHAPPENS. AN INCIDENT THAT OBVIOUSLY IS\nNOW CREATING A RIPPLE EFFECT FOR TRAVELERS.\nFRANKLY, POTENTIALLY INCLUDING US, TRUMP TYPICALLY WOULD LAND\nBACK AT THE FBO AT LaGUARDIA AIRPORT AFTER HIS RALLIES AND\nTHAT IS WHERE WE WERE SET TO HEAD TONIGHT.\nSO WE'LL SEE HOW THAT UNFOLDS. HE IS ABOUT TO TAKE THE STAGE IF\nI'M LISTENING BEHIND ME CORRECTLY.\nI THINK HIS MUSIC IS ABOUT TO BEGIN.\nI WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF HE MENTIONED WHAT HAPPENS AT THE\nTOP OF HIS REMARKS, CHRIS. THAT'S SOMETHING TO SEE.\nDONALD TRUMP WALKS ON THE STAGE RIGHT NOW.\nCHRIS? >> ALL RIGHT.\nJOINING ME NO -- CONSERVATIVE COLUMNIST, A.J. DELGADO, SENIOR\nADVISER TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE\nTHERE. I'M GLAD EVERYBODY IS OKAY.\nAT LaGUARDIA. RICK, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS\nQUOTE, \"WE OWN THE FUTURE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY\"?\n>> LOOK, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY SOLD ITSELF LOCK, STOCK AND\nBARREL TO DONALD TRUMP SO THEY DO IN A WAY.\nIF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE TRUMP DEMOGRAPHIC OWNING THE\nFUTURE, IT'S NOT A VERY LONG FUTURE SINCE THEY'RE ABOUT 65\nYEARS OLD MEDIAN. SO I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT THEY\nCOMPLETELY CONTROL THE FUTURE. I THINK WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE\nIS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AT THE END OF THIS, IF TRUMP CRASHES\nAND BURNS AS IT LOOKS LIKE HE WILL, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS\nGOING TO -- A FACTION OF IT WILL SPLIT OFF AND SAY, WE NEEDED\nMORE TRUMP, MORE PEPPY THE FROG, MORE WHITE SUPREMACY.\nTHERE'S A FRACTION THAT'S GOING TO SAY DONALD WHO, WHAT?\nTHEY'RE GOING TO PRETEND HE NEVER EXISTED AND HOPE THEY CAN\nJUST SKATE OUT OF IT. I THINK THERE'S A GROWING NUMBER\nOF CONSERVATIVES WHO ARE FOLLOWING FOLKS LIKE EVAN\nMacMULLAN WHO ARE LOOKING AT A FUTURE WHERE A CONSERVATIVE\nCENTER RIGHT THIRD PARTY THAT GETS RID OF THE LEGACY CODE AND\nTHE NEGATIVE STUFF THAT HAS ACCRUED AROUND THE REPUBLICAN\nPARTY, MOVES FORWARD INTO THE FUTURE.\nI THINK YOU'RE LOOKING AT A REPUBLICAN PARTY CRACKUP IN A\nLOT OF THESE SCENARIOS. >> ALL RIGHT.\nDONALD TRUMP TAKING THE PODIUM RIGHT NOW.\nLET'S TAKE A LISTEN FOR A SECOND.\n>> AND YOU'VE GOT THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE STANDING\nOUTSIDE TRYING TO GET IN. IT'S AMAZING.\nIT'S AMAZING. AND YOU KNOW, WHEN I CAME OVER,\nI WAS JUST WATCHING THE TELEVISION, I WATCHED ONE OF THE\nCOMMENTATORS SAY THAT WE HAVE A FEW THOUSAND PEOPLE HERE.\nFEW THOUSAND. YOU KNOW WHAT A FEW THOUSAND\nPEOPLE, THAT MEANS 3,000 PEOPLE. HE SAID WE HAVE A FEW THOUSAND\nPEOPLE AND I SAID, OH, THESE PEOPLE.\nFORGET IT. THIS IS NOT A FEW -- TO ME, A\nFEW THOUSAND IS 3,000. THIS IS NO 3,000.\nTHIS IS 15,000. THIS IS NO 3,000.\nTHIS IS 20,000 IF WE GET THEM IN.\nSO WE'LL TRY GETTING THEM IN, BUT LET'S START, RIGHT?\nTHANK YOU, EVERYBODY, FOR BEING HERE.\nIN 12 DAYS, WE ARE GOING TO WIN OHIO AND WE ARE GOING TO WIN\nBACK THE WHITE HOUSE. BELIEVE ME.\nABOUT TIME. >> THOUGHT HE MIGHT SAY\nSOMETHING ABOUT THE PLANE THERE, BUT BIG CROWD THERE IN OHIO\nWHICH WE SHOULD NOTE IS A STATE HE IS SORT OF ONE OF THE STATES\nHE'S OUTPERFORMING RIGHT NOW, LOOKS LIKE HE'S OUTPERFORMING\nMITT ROMNEY IN 2012. IT'S VERY TIGHT THERE.\nA.J., YOUR RESPONSE TO WHAT RICK SAID.\n>> I HAVE TO SAY AS A LATINA, THE MENTION OF THERE BEING AN\nELEMENT OF WHITE SUPREMACY IN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS RIDICULOUS\nAND OFFENSIVE. SOMEBODY IN HER 30s --\n>> I CAN SHOW THEM TO YOU. >> I FIND THE AGE YOU MENTIONED\nSAYING THE AVERAGE TRUMP SUPPORTER IS IN THEIR 60s IS\nRIDICULOUS. THIS IS WHAT THEY DO, THEY\nATTACK US WITH THE SAME OLD TIRED DEMOCRATIC TALKING POINTS\nOF RACIST, WHATEVER IT MAY BE. THE BOTTOM LINE IS, WE OWN THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY. BRAD PASCAL, SECRET WEAPON OURN\nOUR CAMPAIGN, TREMENDOUS GUY. THE PAUL RYAN STYLE OF\nCONSERVATISM, THE GEORGE BUSH STYLE OF CONSERVATISM, PRO-WAR,\nPRO-TAX CUTS ONLY FOR THE RICH, WHICH IS MAYBE WHAT RICK LIKES\nIS DEAD. THANK GOD.\nTHANKS TO DONALD TRUMP. LOOK AT PAUL RYAN'S FAVORABILITY\nNUMBERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THAT CONSERVATISM IS DEAD.\nIT'S NOW THE TRUMPIAN STYLE OF CONSERVATIVE.\nTHANK THE LORD. >> RICK, I'LL LET YOU RESPOND.\nTWO LITTLE THINGS, ONE, THE TAX CUT PLAN PUT FORWARD BY DONALD\nTRUMP IS ACTUALLY MORE SKEWED TO THE RICH THAN --\n>> NO, IT ISN'T. >> -- GEORGE W. BUSH.\n>> IT IS. BUT, AND THE SECOND THING IS --\n>> YES, IT IS. >> I JUST WANT TO DISTINGUISH\nBETWEEN TWO CLAIM, RIGHT, WHICH IS IF YOU'RE A TRUMP SUPPORTER\nYOU'RE THERE FOR A RACIST OR WHITE SUPREMACIST WHICH I WOULD\nNEVER SAY AND DON'T THINK RICK WOULD SAY.\nTHE PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT ARE RACIST AND WHITE SUPREMACIST,\nTHEY'RE OVERWHELMINGLY AND PUBLICLY SUPPORTING DONALD\nTRUMP. >> THAT'S NOT TRUE.\nCAN WE TALK ABOUT THE REAL ISSUE?\n>> A.J., IT IS TRUE. THE PEOPLE ON THE WHITE\nSUPREMACISTS ALL-RIGHT MOVEMENT IN THIS COUNTRY FLOCK TO DONALD\nTRUMP. >> RICK, AS SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T\nHAVE A JOB RIGHT NOW, MY GOOD FRIEND WHO'S A VETERAN AND\nDOESN'T HAVE A JOB RIGHT NOW, STAYS HOME TAKING CARE OF HIS\nFATHER WITH ALZHEIMER'S, THEY DON'T HAVE MONEY TO FIND THE\nPROPER CARE FOR HIM. DO YOU THINK HE WANTS TO WATCH\nTHIS SHOW, SEE US BICKER WHO HAS TWO WHITE SUPREMACIST TWITTER\nFOLLOWERS, RATHER THAN WHO'S GOING TO HELP HE AND HIS FAMILY?\nCAN WE TALK ABOUT THE REAL ISSUES?\n>> THE FACT THAT DAVID DUKE AND THE ALT RIGHT HAVE FLOCKED TO\nDONALD TRUMP AND THAT REPUBLICAN LEADERS --\n>> AND THIS MAKES A DIFFERENCE IN THE AVERAGE VOTERS' LIVES\nHOW? CAN'T SAY.\n>> FAILED TO STEP UP AND CONSISTENTLY DENOUNCED THE FACT\nTHAT DONALD TRUMP, THIS IS -- >> HE HAS DENOUNCED DAVID DUKE\nDOZENS OF TIMES. >> HE APPEALS TO THESE PEOPLE.\nTHE DOG WHISTLING NEVER STOPS FROM DONALD TRUMP TO THESE\nPEOPLE. AND THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS\nTHIS IS A GUY -- >> SO BEING AGAINST ILLEGAL\nIMMIGRATION IS DOG WHISTLING ACCORDING TO THEM?\nTHIS IS HOW RIDICULOUS THE DISCOURSE HAS BECOME, RICK.\n>> THIS IS A GUY WHO IS FEEDING THESE PEOPLE WITH A NOD AND A\nWINK EVERY SINGLE DAY, A GUY WHO CONSTANTLY DENIGRATES WOMEN,\nMUSLIMS, MINOR TOIIES IN A HOSTF DIFFERENT WAYS.\nI'M NOT SAYING EVERY PERSON WHO SUPPORTS DONALD TRUMP IS A\nRACIST, THAT'S ABSURD. EVERY RACIST YOU TURN OVER --\nEVERY TIME YOU TURN OVER A ROCK AND FIND A RACIST, THEY HAVE A\nRED MAGA HAT ON. THERE IS NOT A -- THERE'S NOT A\nCOINCIDENCE HERE. >> LET ME ASK YOU THIS ABOUT HOW\nFOLKS ARE FEELING INSIDE THE CAMPAIGN.\nHE WATCHES A LOT OF TV, DONALD TRUMP.\nNOTICE THAT? HE WATCHES A LOT OF CABLE NEWS.\n>> HE ENJOYS BEING INFORMED. THAT'S TO HIS CREDIT.\nHE WATCHES CABLE NEWS. >> THERE'S OBVIOUSLY SORT OF\nTHIS PERCEPTUAL THING, EVERY CAMPAIGN I'VE EVER COVERED UP\nUNTIL THE DAY YOU'RE THERE, I'VE BEEN WITH CANDIDATES WHO ARE\nDOWN 40 POINTS SAYING WE'RE GOING TO WIN, SHOCK THE WORLD.\nNO ONE GOES AROUND SAYING, WE'RE GETTING OUR BUTTS KICKED.\n>> IT DOES HAPPEN. >> I GUESS MY POINT IS, LIKE,\nYOU GUYS FEEL YOU ARE PREPARED, HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE THE\nRACE? TIED, CLOSE, DONALD TRUMP IS\nWINNING? >> WE'RE WINNING IN THE KEY THAT\nI CARE ABOUT, FLORIDA. SO I WOULD SAY -- I WOULDN'T SAY\nIT'S A DEAD HEAT. I WOULD SAY WE'RE SLIGHTLY\nAHEAD. >> THERE'S ONE POLL OUT TODAY --\n>> IF YOU SAID IT WAS A DEAD HEAT, I'D SAY THAT'S FAIR.\nIT'S ANYBODY'S RACE RIGHT NOW. >> RICK, DO YOU THINK -- HOW\nMUCH DOES WHAT HAPPENS ON ELECTION DAY MATTER TO THE\nVALIDITY OF THAT STATEMENT ABOUT WE OWN THE FUTURE OF THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY? WHICH IS TO SAY IF DONALD TRUMP\nWINS, OBVIOUSLY, THAT'S ONE SCENARIO, IF HE OUTPERFORMED\nMITT ROMNEY OR UNDERPERFORMS JOHN McCAIN, DOES THAT -- DOES\nTHE RANGE OF OPTIONS HERE MATTER IN TERMS OF WHAT ENDS UP\nHAPPENING TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY?\n>> YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK IT DOES, CHRIS, BECAUSE DONALD\nTRUMP'S BRAND IS SO DEEPLY OFFENSIVE TO SO MANY AMERICANS\nTHAT I THINK THAT, LOOK, REPUBLICANS RAN CAMPAIGNS\nAGAINST DEMOCRATS FOR 40 YEARS USING TED KENNEDY AND JIMMY\nCARTER AS SORT OF THE DEMONS OUT THERE.\nTHE REPRESENTED THE WORST OF LIBERAL EXCESS, ET CETERA.\nDEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO HAVE DONALD TRUMP TO HANG AROUND THE\nNECKS OF REPUBLICANS BECAUSE THE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP IN THIS\nCOUNTRY HAS FAILED AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN TO HOLD DONALD\nTRUMP TO ACCOUNT, TO MAKE HIM CONFORM TO THE VALUES THAT THE\nPARTY CLAIMS IT REPRESENTS, AND TO SHOW SOME SPINE AND BACKBONE\nWHEN THIS GUY CONTINUES TO DO THINGS THAT ARE PROFOUNDLY\nOFFENSIVE TO WOMEN, TO MINORITIES, TO MUSLIMS.\nTHIS IS A GUY WHO'S -- HE'S LIKE A 360 DEGREE OFFENSE MACHINE.\nYOU CAN BE -- THIS GUY WILL ATTACK PEOPLE NO MATTER WHO THEY\nARE AND THAT DAMAGE IS GOING TO SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE REPUBLICAN\nINFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE ITS LEADERS FAILED AGAIN AND AGAIN\nTO STAND UP AND TO STAND FOR THE PRINCIPLES THAT THEY CLAIM THE\nPARTY REPRESENTS. >> DO YOU THINK -- DO YOU THINK\nIT MATTERS, OBVIOUSLY IF HE WINS, HE BECOMES PRESIDENT OF\nTHE UNITED STATES, THAT MATTERS A LOT.\nDO YOU THINK IT MATTERS IF HE DOESN'T WIN, WHAT THE NON-WIN\nLOOKS LIKE? >> NO, WE WILL WIN.\n>> I DO THINK THE -- >> AT THE END OF THE DAY, RICK,\nGETTING BACK TO WHAT YOU SAID, THOUGH, ABOUT, LOOK, MAYBE THERE\nIS RACISTS OUT THERE THAT WEARS A M.A.G.A. HAT.\nTHERE PROBABLY IS. I WON'T DISPUTE THAT.\n>> I'VE ENCOUNTERED THEM. >> WHO WILL BENEFIT MINORITIES\nMORE? THEY HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THINGS\nLIKE THIS BECAUSE THEY WON'T BEAT US ON THE ISSUES.\nEVEN ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, IT'S AFRICAN-AMERICANS WHO SUFFER\nFROM IT MOST. >> A.J. --\n>> ANTI-RACIST PLATFORM AND POLICIES BELONG TO DONALD TRUMP.\nNOT TO HILLARY CLINTON. >> I WILL CONCLUDE -- I WILL\nCONCLUDE THIS BY SAYING -- >>",

NINE REPUBLICANS VOTED FOR\nSONIA SOTOMAYOR. EVEN THOUGH REPUBLICAN\nLEADERSHIP PLEDGED TO HOLD OFF ON JUDGE MERRICK\nGARLAND. SOME INCLUDING FLAKE INSIST\nTHEY SHOULD TAKE A DIFFERENT COURSE.\n>> WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT THIS NOMINATION IN A LAME DUCK\nSESSION IN NOVEMBER. I WOULD RATHER HAVE A LESS\nLIBERAL NOMINEE LIKEMAKER GARLAND THAN A NOMINEE THAT\nHILLARY CLINTON, IF SHE WERE PRESIDENT, WOULD PUT\nFORWARD. >> ANY PROSPECT OF A\nLONG-TERM DELAY ON CLINTON NOMINEES WOULD REQUIRE\nSENATE REPUBLICANS TO NOT ONLY HOLD BUT ALSO KEEP\nTHEIR MAJORITY THROUGHOUT CLINTON'S POTENTIAL\nPRESIDENCY. IF THEY DO, OUTGOING SENATE\nMINORITY LEADER HARRY REID HAS ALREADY SUGGESTED THAT\nSENATE DEMOCRATS COULD CONFIRM NOMINEES THROUGH A,\nQUOTE, NUCLEAR OPTION. SUCH A MOVE WOULD PREVENT A\nFILIBUSTER AND RENDER A REPUBLICAN MINORITY\nPOWERLESS. >> SHANNON, THANK YOU.\nAND WHAT KIND OF SUPREME COURT WOULD HILLARY CLINTON\nLIKE TO SEE? SHE GAVE A BIG HINT RECENTLY\nBUT IT'S NOT GOTTEN MUCH ATTENTION.\nWE WILL DISCUSS THAT NEXT.",

      "text": ">>> LAST WEEK'S FINAL\nPRESIDENTIAL DEBATE ABOUT THE SUPREME COURT HAS BEEN\nWIDELY OVER LOOKED. HERE IS HOW ANSWERED CHRIS\nWALLACE'S FINAL QUESTION. >> I FEEL STRONGLY THAT THE\nSUPREME COURT NEEDS TO SIDE ON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\nNOT ON THE SIDE OF THE POWERFUL CORPORATIONS AND\nTHE WEALTHY. >> IS THAT WHAT THE SUPREME\nCOURT OUGHT TO BE DOING. NIGHTLY POLITICAL PANEL IS\nBACK. MOLLY HEMINGWAY EDITOR AT\nTHE FEDERALIST. NINA.\n>> IN TERMS OF POLITICAL RHETORIC; STOCK LIBERAL\nDEMOCRAT, HER IDEA OF POLITICS.\n>> WHAT SHE IS SAYING THOUGH IS THAT THE COURT SHOULD\nTAKE A SIDE. >> IT HAS TO DO WITH THE\nCOURTS. IT'S ONLY GOING TO FEED THE\nCRITICS WHO SAY THAT SHE REALLY DOESN'T CARE ABOUT\nIMPOSING A CONSTITUTIONAL STANDARD ON JUDGMENTS THAT\nSHE REALLY WANTS TO GO IN WITH AN AGENDA.\nBY THE WAY, THE OTHER PIECE OF THAT QUOTE WAS SHE SAID I\nWANT JUSTICES WHO WILL UPHOLD ROE V. WADE AND WILL\nOVERTURN CITIZENS VS. UNITED.\nNOW, IN MY DAY IT USED TO BE THAT WOULD BE CALLED A\nLITMUS TEST. >> THEY WERE FORBIDDEN AT\nONE TIME. >> THEY WERE FORBIDDEN WHEN\nIT CAME TO SUPREME COURT JUSTICES.\nAND I THINK NOW SHE HAS KIND OF RERAISED IT.\nON THE OTHER HAND, SOUNDS LIKE THE REPUBLICANS IN THE\nSENATE IF THEY INDEED CONTROL THE SENATE ARE NOT\nGOING TO LET HER MOVE ON ANYBODY.\n>> WE HEARD THAT BUT GO AHEAD, MOLLY.\n>> I THINK THIS IS ACTUALLY A VERY TROUBLING INDICATION\nTHAT SHE DOES NOT HAVE A GOOD CONSTITUTIONAL\nUNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THE SUPREME COURT\nIS. JUST A COUPLE BLOCKS FROM\nHERE IS THE SUPREME COURT. AS YOU ENTER IN BIG LETTERS\nAT THE TOP IT SAYS EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW THAT\nIS THE PURPOSE OF THE COURT TO MAKE SURE WE ARE A NATION\nOF LAWS U NOT MEN AND LIVE UNDER SELF-GOVERNED VERY\nCONSTITUTIONAL PEOPLE. WHETHER YOU ARE WEALTHY OR\nPOOR. POWERFUL OR POWERLESS,\nWHITE, BLACK, MALE, FEMALE, THAT IS NOT THE THING THAT\nWE USE TO DECIDE WHETHER YOU ARE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE\nLAW OR NOT. WE HAVE LAWS AND WE APPLY\nTHEM UNIVERSALLY. AND EQUALLY FOR ALL PEOPLE.\nSO WHEN SHE SAYS THAT IT'S -- THAT THE PURPOSE OF\nTHE COURT IS TO GO AGAINST WEALTHY PEOPLE, THAT IS A\nVERY DEEPLY TROUBLING THING. AND EVEN MORE SO SINCE THE\nBIG CONCERN WITH HILLARY CLINTON'S POLITICAL CAREER\nIS THAT SHE HAS NOT BEEN HELD, THAT SHE IS ABOVE THE\nLAW. THAT SHE HAS NOT BEEN HELD\nTO THE STANDARDS OF THE LAW. IT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK\nPEOPLE SHOULD REALLY PAY ATTENTION TO.\n>> THERE WAS A TIME AS YOU SUGGESTED EARLIER WHEN IF\nYOU WERE TALKING ABOUT A POTENTIAL JUSTICE OF THE\nSUPREME COURT, AND YOU SUGGESTED THAT THE -- THAT\nJUSTICE SHOULD TILT TO ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER OR SHOULD\nFAVOR ONE GROUP OVER ANOTHER THAT ARGUMENT WAS NOT\nACCEPTABLE. BUT IT SEEMS NOW TO BE\nSTANDARD. >> YOU HAVE TO BE VERY\nCAREFUL ABOUT THAT. PARTICULARLY ON ISSUES LIKE\nABORTION. YOU HAVE TO BE EXTREMELY\nCAREFUL BOTH AS THE -- AS A PRESIDENT NOMINATING AND AS\nTHE SUPPORTERS AND, OF COURSE, AS THE NOMINEE FOR A\nSUPREME COURT JUSTICE. AND SO THAT'S WHY, OF\nCOURSE, WE HAVE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES WHO HAVE\nLIKE MERRICK GARLAND WHO IS UP\nNOW BEFORE THE OBAMANOM KNEE WHO IS BEFORE THE SENATE WHO\nHAVE A VERY VAGUE BACKGROUND.\nYOU HAVE NO IDEA WHERE HE STANDS SPECIFICALLY ON THESE\nKINDS OF ISSUES. >> PART OF THE PROBLEM IS\nTHE COURT ITSELF THOUGH. THE COURT HAS BEEN MAKING SO\nMANY DECISIONS WHERE THEY ARE NOT EVEN PRETENDING TO\nROOT THEM IN THE CONSTITUTION OR FEELING OF\nVARIOUS JUSTICES. NOT SURPRISING FOR A LOT OF\nPEOPLE THE COMPOSITION OF THE COURT IS THE MAIN\nDETERMINANT FOR WHO THEY ARE VOTING FOR.\n>> THE COURT SHOULD BE ON THE SIDE OF THE COMMON MAN.\nEVERYBODY IS SUPPOSED TO BE EQUAL, RIGHT?\n>> YES. BUT MORE THAN THAT, TOO.\nWHEN SHE MENTIONED CITIZENS UNITED WE CANNOT FORGET THAT\nWAS A DECISION SPECIFICALLY ABOUT WHETHER AMERICANS HAVE\nTHE RIGHT TO CRITICIZE HILLARY CLINTON.\nSO WHEN SHE SAYS SHE IS AGAINST THAT RULING, THAT'S\nSOMETHING THAT VERY MUCH IS IN HER OWN INTEREST AND NOT\nTHE COMMON MAN. >> THANK YOU.\nWE HAVE A FOX NEWS ALERT COMING UP HERE.\nGOVERNOR MIKE PENCE'S AIRPLANE HAS SLID OFF THE\nRUNWAY AT NEW YORK'S LAGUARDIA AIRPORT.\nEVERYONE IS OKAY. DAN GALLOW OUR FOX NEWS\nPRODUCER WAS ON THE PLANE AND HE JOINS US ON THE\nPHONE. DAN, WHAT HAPPENED?\n>> HEY, BRIT. I GUESS PROBABLY 7 MINUTES\nAGO WE LANDED. AND IT WAS A THE CRAZIEST\nLANDING ANYBODY ON THIS PLANE HAS EVER EXPERIENCED.\nIT SEEMED LIKE THE BRAKES WERE BEING JAMMED ON FORT\nDURATION OF THE LANDING. >> WHAT DID YOU FEEL?\n>> WELL, IT FELT LIKE THE BRAKES WERE BEING JAMMED ON\nTHE ENTIRE TIME. THE PLANE SEEMED TO BE\nSLIDING OFF THE ONE DIRECTION.\nIT'S HARD TO SEE OUT THE WINDOW BECAUSE IT'S RAINING\nRIGHT NOW AND THE WINDOW IS COVERED IN RAIN.\nBUT THE SMELL OF BURNING RUBBER WAS OBVIOUS THE\nENTIRE TIME AND BY THE TIME WE FINALLY STOPPED,\nAPPARENTLY WE WERE IN THE GRASS.\n>> AND EVERYBODY IS OKAY? >> EVERYBODY SEEMS TO BE\nFINE. NO INJURIES OR ANYTHING.\nGOVERNOR PENCE CAME BACK PROBABLY WITHIN A MINUTE OR\nTWO OF LANDING AND ASKED IF EVERYBODY WAS FINE AND HE\nSEEMED TO BE FINE. HE SAID THEY SAW MUD ON THE\nWINDOWS AT THE FRONT OF THE PLANE.\nRIGHT NOW THERE ARE EMERGENCY VEHICLES THAT SEEM\nTO BE APPROACHING OUR PLANE HERE.\n>> WE GOT A SHOT OF IT AND ALL KINDS OF BLINKING LIGHTS\nAND LOOKS LIKE A PRETTY WATERY SITUATION THERE DAN,\nI'M GLAD YOU'RE WELL. I HAVE A FEELING YOU WILL BE\nON THAT PLANE A WHILE LONGER TONIGHT.\nSTAY SAFE. APPRECIATE IT.\n>> MORE \"ON THE RECORD\" STRAIGHT AHEAD.",

THE PLANE HAD A TOUGH LANDING.\nTHIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME THIS PLANE'S HAD A TOUGH LANDING.\nTHE FLIGHT WAS ACTUALLY DELAYED BY ABOUT TWO HOURS WHEN THE\nPLANE LANDED, WE WERE GOING THROUGH THE -- GOING THROUGH THE\nCLOUDS, HIT THE GROUND, AND AND WE STARTED TO SKID.\nYOU FELT SKIDDING. THE PLANE STARTED TO SWERVE TO\nTHE RIGHT AND THERE WAS SOME BUMPING THEN THE PLANE STOPPED.\nAS I SAID, THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME.\nTHIS IS THE TENTH CAMPAIGN PLANE, HE'S BEEN FLYING ON THIS\nPLANE FOR THREE-PLUS MONTH, SUSPECT THE FIRST TIME THE PLANE\nHAS HAD A ROUGHER LANDING. IT'S BECOME SORT OF A JOKE, GET\nREADY FOR THE LANDING. BUT OBVIOUSLY THE CONDITIONS\nWERE A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT HERE IN NEW YORK CITY TONIGHT.\nAND WE'RE GOING TO ZOOM IN, THAT IS KAREN PENCE, THAT I BELIEVE\nYOU'LL BE SEEING. I THINK WE'RE ON A LITTLE BIT OF\nA DELAY. THAT IS KAREN PENCE GETTING OFF\nTHE PLANE THERE. BUT THE PLANE SWERVED OFF AND WE\nNEED TO -- OKAY. WE NEED A SHOT OF THE GOVERNOR.\nSO WE'RE BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM THE SCENE HERE.\nYOU'RE GOING TO SEE THE GOVERNOR HERE IN A FEW MOMENTS.\nWE'RE BEING LED AWAY, BUT THE PLANE SLID OFF.\nEVERYBODY GOT UP. THERE WAS NO -- TO BE CLEAR,\nEVERYTHING FLEW AROUND AND FLEW FORWARD, BUT THE SITUATION WAS\nNOT IN WHICH ANYBODY WAS BEING THROWN AROUND.\nTHE GOVERNOR GOT UP QUICKLY AND HE WALKED -- AND HE WALKED BACK\nTO THE BACK OF THE PLANE. ACTUALLY WAS MAKING SURE THAT\nEVERYBODY WAS OKAY. AND EVEN KIND OF GAVE SOME FIST\nPUMPS IN THE AIR JUST AS EVERYBODY'S OKAY, EVERYBODY'S\nSAFE. HE'S MAKING SURE THAT EVERYBODY\nWAS OKAY. WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY REALIZE THAT\nWE WERE TOTALLY OFF OF THE RUNWAY WHEN THIS HAPPENED.\nBUT IT WASN'T UNTIL WE STARTED TO SEE THE LIGHTS, THE\nAMBULANCE -- OR THE FIRE TRUCKS ALL OUT THERE.\nYOU CAN SEE THE RESPONSE. WE'RE JUST KIND OF GOING WITH\nTHIS AT THIS POINT, YOU GUYS. >> YEAH.\n>> BUT THE GOVERNOR WAS OKAY. KAREN PENCE IS ON THE PLANE,\nKAREN PENCE THE FIRST LADY OF INDIANA, CHARLOTTE PENCE, THEIR\nOLDEST DAUGHTER WHO TRAVELS FREQUENTLY WITH THE CAMPAIGN.\nCAMPAIGN STAFF, THE SECRET SERVICE WHO TAKES UP TEN ROWS\nAND ABOUT EIGHT MEMBERS OF THE PRESS AND THEN THEY BROUGHT UP\nTHE STAIRS AND OBVIOUSLY WE JUST GOT OFF -- I THINK WE SAW\nEARLIER WHEN THE FEED STARTED COMING IN, YOU SAW MUD STREAKS\nAND WE ARE -- WE'RE BEING -- WE'RE -- SORRY.\nWE'RE BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM THE SCENE HERE.\n>> VAUGHN, IT'S BASICALLY -- CAN YOU TELL ME, OBVIOUSLY THE\nGOVERNOR AND HIS WIFE AND THEIR DAUGHTER, THEM, STAFF AND PRESS,\nIS THAT BASICALLY WHO'S ON THAT PLANE?\n>> YEP, THAT'S WHO'S ON THE PENCE PLANE.\nHE HAD A STOP -- HE WAS COMING FROM FT. DODGE, IOWA, LANDING\nFOR A FUND-RAISER WHICH WE'LL SEE WHETHER THAT HAPPENS.\nTHAT WAS GOING TO BE AT TRUMP TOWER THIS EVENING.\nTHE TRUMP, ACTUALLY, WE SENT VIDEO EARLIER OF THE GOVERNOR\nPLAYING FOOTBALL ON THE TARMAC BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER\nCONDITIONS. I'LL LET YOU HANDLE WHAT THE\nACTUAL WEATHER, WHAT THE SITUATION WAS, BUT WE ARE ABLE\nTO SEE HERE, I'M GOING TO GO OVER HERE TO THE RIGHT AND YOU\nCAN SEE HOW CLOSE WE ARE, AGAIN, I THINK THERE ARE VIDEOS ON\n20-SECOND DELAY HERE. BUT YOU'LL SEE HOW CLOSE TO THE\nROAD WE ARE OVER HERE ON THE RIGHT SIDE.\nAND LITERALLY INSIDE OF THE GRASS --\n>> WOW. >> I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS ARE\nSEEING THAT NOW. >> YEAH, WE CAN.\n>> AND YOU SEE ACTUALLY, I'M GOING TO ZOOM IN HERE TO WHERE\nTHE FENCE IS. YOU DON'T -- IT'S ACTUALLY\nPRETTY REMARKABLE. NOW, WE'RE JUST COMING TO GRIPS\nWITH KIND OF LOOKING AT THIS. HOW CLOSE WE WERE TO -- HOW\nCLOSE WE WERE TO THE ROAD. >> THAT PLANE IS PRETTY FAR OFF\nTHAT RUNWAY. >> YEAH.\nIT'S IN THE GRASS THERE WHICH I GUESS THE IMPACT OF THE PLANE\nCREATED MUD WHICH IS THE MUD MARKS THAT WE ARE ABLE TO SEE\nWHEN WE FIRST GOT OFF OF THE PLANE THERE, BUT EVERYBODY --\nI'M PRETTY SURE I'VE STILL GOT -- I STILL HAVE BAGS UP ON\nTHE PLANE. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT CAME AND\nSAID, PLEASE, EVERYBODY, JUST GET OFF THE PLANE NOW.\nWE WERE TRYING TO ESTABLISH A SHOT HERE.\nAGAIN, WE DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE HONESTLY WHAT HAPPENED RIGHT\nWHEN IT HAPPENED, BUT THE GOVERNOR GOT UP IMMEDIATELY,\nMADE SURE SECRET SERVICE, MADE SURE THE PRESS WAS OKAY.\nI THINK WE GOT THE SHOT. WE SEE HIM BACK OVER HERE.\nSORRY. IT'S A -- I MAY EVEN HAVE SOME\nRAINDROPS. >> VAUGHN, WHERE WERE YOU GUYS\nCOMING IN FROM? >> WE WERE COME IN FROM FT.\nDODGE, IOWA, WHERE WE HAD A CAMPAIGN EVENT.\nWE HAD A ABOUT TWO, THREE-HOUR FLIGHT.\nSO WE'VE BEEN IN THE AIR FOR A LITTLE WHILE.\nWE KNEW THE STORM WAS IN HERE. IT WAS DELAYED FOR THE\nFUND-RAISER, WAS SUPPOSED TO START EARLIER THIS EVENING IN\nNEW YORK CITY. >> WERE THERE ANNOUNCEMENTS\nMADE, OBVIOUSLY YOU GUYS HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS HAPPENING, FELT\nTHE IMPACT, DIDN'T QUITE REALIZE THE SKID.\nDID ANYONE SAY ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING AS IT\nHAPPENED? >> ABSOLUTELY.\nAND, YOU KNOW, I'LL BE HONEST, I HAD MY PHONE OUT AND WAS\nRECORDING A FELLOW REPORTER WAS SLEEPING, AND BECAUSE IT'S NOT\nUNNORMAL TO HAVE THESE HARD IMPACTS, WE WERE RECORDING.\n. I LITERALLY TURNED IT OFF\nBECAUSE I THOUGHT WE WERE FINE. THEN SUDDENLY WE SLID OFF.\nBUT EVERYTHING, PHONES, WATER BOTTLES, ABOUT TWO SECONDS AFTER\nTHE LANDING, SUDDENLY EVERYTHING JUST SHOT FORWARD.\nMY SEAT BELT WASN'T FULLY TIGHTENED AND I FLEW FORWARD AND\nWAS OBVIOUSLY CAUGHT BY THE SEAT BELT, BUT",

      "text": "IN A HARVARD INSTITUTE OF\nPOLITICS POLL SHE HAS 49% OF YOUNG VOTERS SAYING THAT SHE IS\nTHEIR PICK. THAT IS 28% MORE THAN DONALD\nTRUMP. AND WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING IS\nTHAT EVEN THOUGH SHE'S NOT G GETTING QUITE TO WHERE BARACK\nOBAMA WAS IN 2012, IF YOU LOOK AT THE MARGIN IF THIS POLL WERE\nTO HOLD HOW MUCH SHE WOULD BEAT DONALD TRUMP BY, ACTUALLY IT IS\nBY MORE THAN OBAMA BEAT MITT ROMNEY BY.\n>> BRIANNA. THANK YOU.\n\"OUTFRONT\" NOW COREY LEWANDOWSKI.\nAND --. COREY, YOU JUST HEARD MICHELLE\nOBAMA FIRST TIME ON THE TRAIL WITH HILLARY CLINTON TOGETHER,\nIMPASSIONED SPEECH ON HER BEHALF.\nHOW FORMIDABLE IS SHE? WHEN YOU WATCH MICHELLE OBAMA,\nWHAT DO YOU THINK? >> LOOK, I THINK HILLARY CLINTON\nSHOULD EMBRACE MICHELLE OBAMA EVERY CHANCE SHE GETS IF SHE\nWANTS TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nMICHELLE OBAMA IS EXCEPTIONALLY POPULAR.\nWHAT'S VERY INTERESTING AS YOU KNOW IS THE RECENT POLLS\nINDICATE THAT DONALD TRUMP IS GETTING ANYWHERE BETWEEN 18-29%\nOF THE AFRICAN AMERICAN VOTE. SO IF HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO\nGET THAT BACK I THINK MICHELLE OBAMA HAS TO BE ON THE CAMPAIGN\nTRAIL. IT IS JUST A MERE EIGHT YEARS\nTHAT MICHELLE OBAMA TOOK A PASSING SLIGHT AT HILLARY\nCLINTON AND SAID YOU CAN'T CONTROL YOUR OWN HOUSE, YOU\nCAN'T CONTROL THE WHITE HOUSE. POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY.\nBUT I DO THINK MICHELLE OBAMA IS A GOOD SURROGATE FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON RIGHT NOW AND SHE'S MUCH BETTER THAN BILL CLINTON.\nSO I THINK SHE CAN STICK WITH HER AS LONG AS HE CAN.\n>> I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH ANY POLL OR ANY POLL THAT SHOWS THAT\nBY THE WAY. BUT MICHELLE OBAMA AND HILLARY\nCLINTON HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN FRIENDS TO.\nSTATE THE OBVIOUS. AND DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN\nSEIZING ON THAT. HERE IS WHAT HE SAID.\n>> WE HAVE A PRESIDENT. ALL HE WANTS TO DO IS CAMPAIGN.\nHIS WIFE, ALL SHE WANTS DO IS CAMPAIGN.\nAND I SEE HOW MUCH HIS WIFE LIKES HILLARY.\nBUT WASN'T SHE THE ONE THAT ORIGINALLY STARTED THE STATEMENT\n\"IF YOU CAN'T TAKE CARE OF YOUR HOME --,\" RIGHT?\nYOU CAN'T TAKE CARE OF THE WHITE HOUSE OF THE COUNTRY.\n>> HE WAS REFERRING TO MICHELLE OBAMA.\nIF YOU CAN'T RUN YOUR OWN HOUSE YOU CAN'T RUN THE WHITE HOUSE.\nEVERYONE SAW THAT AS THE SLIGHT AT TIME.\nDO PEOPLE NOW BUY ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY ARE FRIENDS?\nTHIS IS GENUINE? >> ABSOLUTELY.\nAND MICHELLE OBAMA EVEN TALKED ABOUT THAT IN HER SPEECH TODAY.\nSHE SAID THAT EVER SINCE HER HUSBAND BARACK OBAMA TOOK THE\nOATH OF OFFICE BILL CLINTON AND HILLARY CLINTON HAVE BEEN\nNOTHING BUT NURTURING AND SUPPORTIVE AND REALLY GOOD\nFRIENDS. AND IN FACT I THINK IT IS\nBECAUSE THEY USED TO BE SO ADVERSARIAL, THIS NOW THAT SHE'S\nSUPPORTING HER IN SUCH A PASSIONATE WAY THAT SHE IS\nREALLY OFFERING THIS CONTRAST IS A LOT MORE CREDIBLE.\nIF YOU WANT TO BRING UP TAPES OF WHAT PEOPLE HAVE SAID BEFORE,\nLET'S BRING UP THE DONALD TRUMP TAPE WHEN HE IS SPEAKING\nBEAUTIFUL IMAGES ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON AND BILL CLINTON.\nSO, YOU KNOW, THINGS CHANGE OBVIOUSLY.\nBUT NOW MICHELLE OBAMA MADE A VERY COMPELLING CONTRAST.\nNOT JUST BETWEEN THE CHARACTER AND THE FITNESS FOR OFFICE OF\nTHESE CANDIDATES, WHICH IS, YOU KNOW, FOR HER AND FOR THE\nMAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NIGHT AND DAY BETWEEN SOMEBODY\nWHO IS NOT FIT FOR OFFICE, DONALD TRUMP AND SOMEBODY WHO IS\nREADY ON DAY ONE. BUT ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THAT\nIS MOMENT WHERE THE CHARACTER OF THE NATION IS GOING TO BE TESTED\nAS A MOTHER AND HILLARY CLINTON AS A MOTHER IT WAS VERY\nCOMPELLING. >> COREY, DO YOU GUY IT?\nTHAT THEY ARE FRIENDS NOW? MICHELLE OBAMA REALLY LIKES\nHILLARY CLINTON? >> OF COURSE NOT.\nBUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS POLITICS MAKES STRANGE BEDFELLOWS.\nALL OF A SUDDEN HILLARY CLINTON AND BERNIE SANDERS ARE BEST OF\nFRIENDS AFTER GOING AT IT FOR MONTHS AND CALLING EACH LIARS\nAND SAYING YOU STOLE THE ELECTION.\nNO YOU DID. THIS IS THE PROBLEM WITH\nPOLITICIANS. THEY SAY BAD THINGS AND THE\nELECTION IS OVER AND THEN BECOME BEST FRIENDS AND OH I REALLY\nLOVE THIS PERSON ALL OVER AGAIN. --\n>> -- DONALD TRUMP. >> -- DONALD TRUMP HAS NEVER\nTRIED TO KISS UP OF THE ESTABLISHMENT.\nHE'S BEEN VERY CLEAR. THIS IS WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\nSEE RIGHT THROUGH. THEY WEREN'T FRIENDS BEFORE.\nTHEY WERE ONLY NOW FOR POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY.\n>> NOW DONALD TRUMP IS TRYING TO WIN OTHER THE FEMALE VOTE.\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS VERY STRONG FEMALE SURROGATES FOR DIFFERENT\nGROUPS. MICHELLE OBAMA, ELIZABETH WARREN\nAMONG THEM. DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT.\nOKAY? HE HAS HIS DAUGHTER OUT THERE A\nSOMETIMES AND HIS WIFE OUT THERE NO TIMES EXCEPT FOR TODAY.\nSHE CAME OUT WITH MELANIA AND DID AN INTERVIEW SIDE BY SIDE\nWITH HIM. AND DONALD TRUMP APPEARED TO\nSURPRISE HER WHEN HE SAID SHE'S GOING TO BE OUT ON THE TRAIL A\nLOT IN THE NEXT 12 DAYS. >> DOES IT MAKE YOU WANT TO GET\nOUT THERE YOURSELF AND HELP HIM OUT THE FINAL TWO WEEKS.\n>> WE'LL SEE. MY PRIORITY IS MY SON BARON.\nOUR SON BARON. AND I SUPPORT HIM 100%.\nAND I'M THERE FOR HIM EVERY TIME HE NEEDS HIM.\nAND I MIGHT JOIN HIM. WE'LL SEE.\n>> SHE'S ACTUALLY GOING TO MAKE TWO OR THREE SPEECHES -- SHE'S\nAMAZING WHEN SHE SPEAKS. SHE'S AN AMAZING PUBLIC SPEAKER.\nSO SHE'S AGREED TO TWO OR THREE SPEECHES AND I THINK IT IS GOING\nTO BE BIG SPEECHES. IMPORTANT SPEECHES.\n>> IS THIS REALLY GOING TO HAPPEN?\nCAN SHE MAKE DIFFERENCE WITH WOMEN IN THE DAYS WE HAVE LEFT?\n12 DAYS. >> WELL I THINK SHE CAN.\nBUT, YOU KNOW, YOU HEARD HER ANSWER.\nHER NUMBER ONE PRIORITY, WHICH I THINK IS EXTREMELY COMMENDABLE\nIS SHE WANTS TO BE THE MOTHER TO HER SON.\nAND I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT.\nBECAUSE THAT IS THE NUMBER ONE PEOPLE FOR A MOTHER IS TO TAKE\nCARE OF THEIR CHILDREN. AND THAT'S WHAT SHE'S MADE HER\nPRIORITY. IS SHE GOING TO GO OUT AND\nSUPPORT HER HUSBAND O AND MAKE THREE OR FOUR SPEECH OS ARE\nFIVE. SURE SHE MADE A SPEECH AT THE\nCONVENTION. I THOUGHT WAS VERY WELL\nRECEIVED. SHE'S ARTICULATE.\nAND MORE IMPORTANTLY SHE'S BEEN A ROCK FOR THAT FAMILY.\nFOR THE TRUMP FAMILY. FOR THE CHILDREN, FOR HIM.\nSHE'S BEEN THE PERSON THAT ER TIME THEY EVER NEEDED SOMETHING\nSHE'S BEEN SUPPORTING HIM EVERY STEP OF THE WAY AND NOW SHE'S\nGOING TO COME OUT TO THE PUBLIC AND MAKE SOME SPEECHES.\nI THINK IT WILL BE THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE IN THE ELECTION.\n>> I MELANIA IS LOVELY. I THINK IT WILL BE TOO LITTLE TO\nMAKE A DIFFERENCE. THAT INTERVIEW I THINK WAS WEIRD\nAND AWKWARD AND FOR ME LOOKED LIKE COMPLETE DISRESPECT FOR\nDONALD TRUMP TO MELANIA. HE CLEARLY MADE THAT UP AS THEY\nWERE MAKING THIS INTERVIEW. SHE HAD NO IDEA SHE WAS DOING\nTHIS. I WILL BELIEVE SHE'S GOING TO\nMAKE TWO OR THREE IMPORTANT SPEECHES.\nTHE MOMENT HE GIVES US HIS TAXES WHICH HE ALSO PROMISED BEFORE\nTHE ELECTION. WE'VE YET TO SEE THAT.\n>> THEY ARE WITH HILLARY'S E-MAILS.\n>> AND NEXT SHARK TANK BARBARA CORCORAN OPENS UP ABOUT DONALD\nTRUMP. WHAT'S HE REALLY LIKE WITH\nWOMEN? WHAT'S HE REALLY LIKE BEHIND\nCLOSED DOORS? SHE'S GOING TO TELL YOU.\nAND TRUMP LEADING TEXAS BY JUST THREE POINTS.\nTHAT IS WITHIN THE MARGIN OF ERROR.\nCOULD TEXAS TURN BLUE? CH",

I MEAN!\nEVERYBODY SAW HER ON TELEVISION. IT'S LIKE THE OLD GROUCHO\nMARCUS. BELIEVE ME OR YOUR LYING EYES.\nWE ALL SAW HER DO VERY WELL IN THE STAMINA DEPARTMENT IN ALL\nTHREE DEBATES. IT'S NOT QUESTIONABLE THAT SHE\nWAS WEAK. >> I THINK THE REALITY FOR TRUMP\nIS THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS VERY EFFECTIVELY BATTED BACK ALL OF\nTHAT. AND PUSHED BACK ON IT VERY, VERY\nCLEARLY AND EFFECTIVELY. AND DONE SO IN A WAY IN WHICH\nSHE SHOWED, ACTUALLY, IN MY VIEW, HIM TO BE THE WEAKER OF\nTHE TWO OF THEM.

MEN WILL FLOCK TO THIS IDEA OF\nSORT OF DOMINANCE AND MACHISMO AND OLD SCHOOL ENTITLEMENT.\nBUT THAT'S NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING.

THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS\nPARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTION. DOESN'T EXIST.\n1.3% OF ABORTIONS TAKE PLACE IN THE THIRD TRIMESTER.\nALMOST ALL OF THEM, BECAUSE THERE IS A SERIOUS HEALTH\nDEPARTMENT PROBLEM FOR THE MOTHER OR THE CHILD OR BOTH.\nAND THAT'S THE REALITY OF THAT, YET NOBODY, EVEN HILLARY\nCLINTON, DID NOT CORRECT CHRIS",

AND YOU SEE ABOUT ALL THIS STUFF\nTHAT NEVER GETS OUT PUBLICLY, I GUESS, WITH THANKS TO THE\nRUSSKIS AND WIKILEAKS, WE NOW GET A VIEW WE NORMALLY DON'T GET\nOF POLITICIANS IN ACTION. >> CHRIS, I'VE BEEN COVERING THE\nCLINTONS SINCE THEY WERE IN LITTLE ROCK.\nAND WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS, AND\nTHROUGH ALL OF HIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS AND HILLARY'S ENTIRE\nCAREER, THEIR WHOLE LIFE IS BUILT ON THE COMBINATION OF\nPUBLIC OFFICE AND MONEY. AND THE CLINTONS DIDN'T HAVE ANY\nMONEY. THEY DIDN'T START OUT WITH ANY\nMONEY. THEY'RE NOT LIKE THE BUSH FAMILY\nOR SOME OTHER PEOPLE -- >> OR THE TRUMP FAMILY.\n>> RIGHT, OR THE TRUMP FAMILY. AND THEY'RE DOWN THERE IN LITTLE\nROCK, AND THEY WANT TO PLAY ON THE NATIONAL STAGE, AND IT\nQUICKLY BECOMES APPARENT TO THEM THAT THEY'VE GOT TO GET IN ON\nTHE MONEY ACTION. NOT SO MUCH, I THINK, BECAUSE\nTHEY'RE PEOPLE, THEY WANT TO BE AROUND THE MONEY, IN ORDER TO\nPLAY IN THE BALL GAME OF POLITICS IN THE WAY IT EXISTS.\n>> WHY DID HILLARY CLINTON DEMAND $250,000 TO GIVE AN\nHOUR-LONG SPEECH. THE SAME SPEECH SHE GIVES OVER\nAND OVER AGAIN. THAT'S NOT ABOUT CAMPAIGNING.\n>> IT'S NOT ABOUT CAMPAIGNING, BUT IT'S ABOUT -- MAYBE I'M\nBEING TOO GENEROUS HERE, BUT THEY SPENT THEIR WHOLE LIVES\nTRYING TO GET CONTRIBUTIONS FROM RICH PEOPLE.\nTHEY'VE IMMERSED THEMSELVES IN THAT, GOING BACK TO RENAISSANCE\nWEEKEND AND THAT NETWORKING BY THE SEA BACK IN THE '80s AND\n'90s. THE BIG DONORS, THE SOFT MONEY\nDONORS. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THEY SPENT\nTHEIR LIVES AROUND, THEY WANT TO BE LIKE THOSE PEOPLE.\nTHEY WANT TO BE LIKE THOSE PEOPLE.\nBECAUSE IT'S DEMEANING TO HAVE TO DO THAT ALL THE TIME.\nTHEY GOING TO BE ON THAT LEVEL, GET THE CASH FOR THEMSELVES.\nMORE IMPORTANT, THEY'RE GOING TO GET THE CASH FOR CAMPAIGN\nCONTRIBUTIONS, FOR PAC CONTRIBUTIONS, FOR THE\nFOUNDATION THAT MAKES THE CLINTONS FEEL GOOD, LIKE THEY'RE\nDOING GOOD IN THE WORLD. IT'S LIKE A CONTINUOUSLY MOVING\nCAR SELL OF ACCESS AND MONEY. NONE OF IT SPECIFICALLY ILLEGAL,\nBUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE TOTALITY OF IT, IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE\nSPENT THEIR WHOLE LIVES SEARCHING FOR CASH, AND USING\nPOWER TO GET IT, TO GET MORE MONEY, TO GET MORE POWER.\nTO GET MORE MONEY. AND THEY HAVE NOT SAID THEY'RE\nGOING TO SHUT DOWN THE CLINTON FOUNDATION THE HILLARY BECOMES\nPRESIDENT. WHAT THEY'VE SAID IS, THEY WILL\nNO LONGER TAKE ANY FOREIGN DONATIONS.\nAND BY THE WAY, CHELSEA CLINTON WASN'T COMPLAINING THAT BILL\nCLINTON -- ABOUT BILL CLINTON LOOKING BAD, FORGETTING CASH FOR\nSPEECHES. SHE WAS COMPLAINING THAT DOUG\nBAND WAS USING THE FOUNDATION TO GET MONEY FOR HIMSELF.\n>> YEAH. >> IT WAS NOT SOME PRINCIPLED\nOBJECTION TO PROTECT HER DAD FROM LOOKING BAD.\nTHEY WANTED AS MUCH MONEY AS THEY COULD GET.\nI MEAN, TWO DAYS AFTER SHE WAS DECLARING HER CANDIDACY IN IOWA,\nHILLARY CLINTON WANTED TO GIVES A SPEECH TO JPMORGAN.\nUNTIL THEY TOLD HER, YOU CAN'T DO IT.\n>> YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK? I'M GOING TO BE MORE JUDGMENTAL\nTHAN BETH WHO'S A STRAIGHT REPORTER.\nI'LL MAKE A JUDGMENT. EVERY TIME I'VE WATCHED A\nPOLITICIAN ENGAGE IN A CERTAIN PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR BEFORE THEY\nGO TO THE WHITE HOUSE, THEY CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN THAT\nPATTERN AFTERWARDS. PEOPLE DON'T CHANGE BECAUSE WE\nSWEAR THEM INTO THE WHITE HOUSE. THEY BECOME THAT PERSON\nBIG-TIME. AND THE CLINTONS WERE RAISING\nMONEY LIKE THIS HAND OVER  MOTEL 6.\nTHEY WERE PULLING THEM IN BY TRAIN LOADS OF CONTRIBUTORS AND\nLETTING THEM SIT IN THE LINCOLN BEDROOM FOR A WHILE AND CHARGING\nTHEM BY THE HOUR. YOU CAN STILL VOTE FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON, BUT REMEMBER, YOU'RE GETTING THIS AS PART OF THE\nPACKAGE, BECAUSE THAT'S, THEIR PATTERN.\nBETH FOUHY, THANK YOU. YOU'RE SO NICE TO THESE PEOPLE.\nUP NEXT, THE CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE HOPING TO KEEP DONALD\nTRUMP FROM WINNING DEEP RED UTAH, EVAN McMULLEN.\nHE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN UTAH.\nIS HE RUNNING ANYWHERE ELSE?

YOU KNOW, MIKE PENCE SAID THE\nVOTERS SHOULD COME HOME TO DONALD TRUMP, WHICH I THINK IS\nRIDICULOUS. BECAUSE CONSERVATIVE VOTERS\nARE -- CAN NEVER BE AT HOME WITH DONALD TRUMP.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS INVITED VLADIMIR PUTIN INTO INFLUENCE\nOUR ELECTIONS AND UNDERMINE OUR ELECTIONS AND OUR DEMOCRATIC\nINSTITUTIONS.

SHE HAS BEEN A FRIEND TO ME\nAND BARACK AND MALIYAH AND SASHA.\n>> EVERY ELECTION IS ABOUT THE FUTURE.\nAND THIS ONE IS ABOUT WHETHER WE BUILD ON THE\nPROGRESS WE'VE MADE THE LEGACY THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA\nHAS BUILT, OR RIP IT AWAY AND GO BACKWARDS.\n>> CLINTON STOPPED BY AN EARLY VOTING STATION HERE IN\nNORTH CAROLINA AFTER LEAVING THE RALLY.\nHER LARGEST YET. IN PERSON EARLY VOTING IN\nNORTH CAROLINA STARTED LAST MONDAY.\nTHE CAMPAIGN SAYS 881,000 VOTES HAVE ALREADY BEEN\nCAST. AND LATINOS HAVE R. VOTING\nAT A RATE 44% HIGHER THAN IN 2012.\nCLINTON ALSO STOPPED BY HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGE\nJUST A LITTLE WHILE AGO, NORTH CAROLINA AT&T IN\nGREENSBORO WHERE ABOUT 2,000 STUDENTS WERE CELEBRATING\nHOMECOMING. EARLIER TODAY, MICHELLE\nOBAMA REMINDED PEOPLE JUST HOW CLOSE THE ELECTION IN\nNORTH CAROLINA WAS IN 2008. >> BARACK WON NORTH CAROLINA\nBY ABOUT 14,000 VOTES. WHICH SOUNDS LIKE A LOT.\nBUT WHEN YOU BREAK THAT NUMBER DOWN, THE DIFFERENCE\nBETWEEN WINNING AND LOSING THIS STATE WAS A LITTLE OVER\n2 VOTES PER PRECINCT. EACH OF YOU COULD SWING AN\nENTIRE PRECINCT AND WIN THIS ELECTION FOR HILLARY.\n>> PRESIDENT OBAMA LOST NORTH CAROLINA IN 2012.\nEVEN THOUGH THE DEMOCRATS HELD THEIR CONVENTION HERE.\nRIGHT NOW, THE POLLS SHOW A DEAD HEAT HERE IN NORTH\nCAROLINA. BACK TO YOU, BRIT.\n>> OKAY. JENNIFER, THANKS VERY MUCH.\nNEXT UP, SHOULD THE MEDIA AND OTHERS BE PROTECTING AN\nACCUSER WHO MADE FALSE GANG RAPE ACCUSATIONS AT THE\nUNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA?

WE'VE TAKEN THOSE OF WAY BECAUSE\nOF THE NEW POLLING THAT. DROPS CLINTON DOWN TO JUST ABOVE\n270. SO IF YOU THINK FOR TRUMP A HA.\nLET ME SHOW YOU NEW STATE POLLING OUT THIS EVENING THAT\nSAYS NOT SO FAST. DONALD TRUMP IS COUNTING ON\nIOWA. HE SAYS IN JUST ABOUT EVERY\nSALESPEOPLE HE'S WINNING IOWA. WELL HE'S NOT.\nIT IS A TIE ACCORDING TO THE NEW QUINNIPIAC UNIVERSITY POLL.\nAND THE POLL ALSO SHOWS THAT IN EARLY VOTING HILLARY CLINTON IS\nDOING QUITE WELL OUT IF IOWA. NOW LET'S MOVE SOUTH TO ANOTHER\nONE OF THESE RUBY RED STATES STILL IN PLAY.\nNOW GEORGIA. 44 FOR DONALD TRUMP, 43 FOR\nHILLARY CLINTON. SO STATISTICALLY A TIE IN\nGEORGIA OF ALL PLACES. AND AGAIN QUINNIPIAC FINDING IN\nITS POLLING HILLARY CLINTON DOING WELL IN EARLY VOTING.\nVIRGINIA, DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN SAYING FROM THE BEGINNING HE\nWANTS TO BRICK VIRGINIA HIS WAY. THIS IS YET ANOTHER POLL.\nFORGET ABOUT VIRGINIA. DOUBLE DIGIT LEAD, 50-38 FOR\nSECRETARY CLINTON. A ONCE RED STATE HAS BECOME A\nBLUE STATE. AND NOW NORTH CAROLINA WHERE\nSECRETARY CLINTON WAS WITH THE FIRST LADY TODAY.\nDONALD TRUMP CANNOT WIN WITHOUT NORTH CAROLINA.\nTHIS IS THE LATEST POLL TO SHOW YES A SMALL, 47-43 BUT A\nSTUBBORN PERSISTENT LEAD FOR CLINTON IN NORTH CAROLINA.\nTHE OTHER MAP WHAT'S THAT MEAN? YOU COULD TAKE AWAY IOWA AND\nCALL IT A TOSS UP. TAKE GEORGIA AWAY.\nTRUMP DOPS TO 157. EVEN IF HE WON ALL THE TOSS UPS,\nSTILL WOULDN'T BE ENOUGH. >> \"OUTFRONT\" CLINTON SUPPORTER\nBASIL SMIKLE. AND JEFFREY LORD.\nOUR EXECUTIVE EDITOR MARK PRESTON AND MAEVE RESTON.\nMARK, THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS SEIZING ON FLORIDA.\nTHEY HAVE ANOTHER POLL TONIGHT SHOWING HER LEAD CUT IN HALF IN\nJUST A FEW DAYS. AND NOW ON THIS MAP FLORIDA NOW,\nNO LONGER CLINTON GOING BACK INTO TOSS UP TERRITORY.\nTHAT IS A BIG POSITIVE. >> CERTAINLY IN A MONTH THAT'S\nBEEN REALLY BAD HEADLINES FOR TRUMP THIS IS A DIG POSITIVE FOR\nHIM. AND FLORIDA, HE NEEDS FLORIDA TO\nWIN. IT REALLY STARTS WITH FLORIDA AS\nWELL. IF HE LOSES FLORIDA EARLY ON\nELECTION NIGHT THE ELECTION IS OVER.\nHOWEVER AS WE'RE SEEING DOWN THERE WE'RE SEEING REPUBLICANS\nNOW STARTING TO COME HOME SO TO SPEAK.\nAND WE EXPECTED THIS BEFORE THE ELECTION ANYWAY.\nTHE REAL FIGHT NOW IS GOING TO BE FOR THOSE INDEPENDENT VOTERS.\nAND THE QUESTION WILL BE WILL WE SEE SPECIFICALLY IN FLORIDA SOME\nMARCO RUBIO SUPPORTERS, WILL THEY EVENTUALLY GO WITH TRUMP\nAND COULD TRUMP HELP MARCO RUBIO.\nSO THERE IS DYNAMICS GOING IN THAT STATE THAT ARE VERY VERY\nINTERESTING. >> AND MIKE PENCE IS SAYING\nHILLARY CLINTON GOT WAY TOO KOKKY.\nHERE IS HOW MIKE PENCE PUT IT. >> HILLARY CLINTON'S OUT THERE.\nWIDENING THE POLLS AND CAMPAIGNING FURTHER CANDIDATES\nAND THEN OOPS.

BUT WE CAN CANNOT BE COMPLACENT.\nAND THAT IS ACTUALLY THE POINT ABOUT INVESTING IN DOWN BALLOT\nRACES. IT IS ABOUT SUPPORTING ALL OF\nTHE CANDIDATES WHO ARE GOING TO GET OUT YOUR MESSAGE.\nAND I DON'T THINK DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO BE INVESTED IN THAT.\nPEOPLE ARE ALREADY VOTING IN VERY HIGH NUMBERS.\nSO THERE IS -- I DON'T WANT TO SAY WE'RE CONFIDENT BUT WE'RE\nCERTAINLY ENCOURAGED. I DON'T THINK QUESTION TAKE\nANYTHING FOR GRANTED THOUGH. >> TO THE EXTENT THEY HAVE BEEN\nDOING THIS ACTING THOMAS DEWEYESQUE HERE THAT THIS IS ALL\nOVER AND THEY ARE GOING TO WIDEN THE BATTLE FIELD.\nTHIS COULD BE A REAL PROBLEM. WHEN YOU GIVE PEOPLE THE IDEA\nYOU ALREADY HAVE IT IN THE BAG AND COMBINE IT WITH THE LACK OF\nENTH ENTHUSIASM.\n>> THOSE TAKEN TOGETHER COULD BE FATAL.\n>> LACK OF ENTHUSIASM, THAT IS NOT THE CASE.\nIF YOU GO THE NOIF HER RALLIES THERE IS NO LACK OF ENTHUSIASM\nTHERE.

SO I'VE NOW SEEN TWO HILLARY\nSIGNS AND TRUMP SIGNS ARE EVERYWHERE.\n>> -- VERY EXCITED. AND IF IF SIGNS GO VOTE YOU MAY\nHAVE A POINT. AND THEY DON'T THAT.\nGOES TO THE POINT EARLIER WHETHER OR NOT REPUBLICANS ARE\nCOMING HOME. I DO WONDER ABOUT THAT.\nVOTERS MAY FORGET WHAT YOU SAY BUT THEY WON'T FORGET HOW YOU\nMADE THEM FEEL. AND WHEN YOU HAVE CANDIDATES\nRUNNING ON DOWN BALLOT RACES AND TRYING TO DEFEND DONALD TRUMP\nAND CAN'T REALLY DO A GOOD JOB OF THAT THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE A\nDIFFICULT TIME. >> AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK A LOT\nMORE ABOUT THAT. THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN DOES SEEM\nCONCERNED ABOUT THIS ISSUE. THEY SENT MICHELLE OBAMA WITHOUT\nQUESTION THE MOST POPULAR DEMOCRAT IN THE COUNTRY.\nTHE BEST SURROGATE HILLARY CLINTON HAS TO NORTH CAROLINA A\nSWING STATE TO STUMP FOR CLINTON AND HERE IS WHAT HE SHE SAID.\n>> LET'S NOT FORGET BACK IN 2012 BARACK ACTUALLY DID LOSE THE\nSTATE BY ABOUT 17 VOTES PER PRECINCT.\n17. THAT'S HOW PRESIDENTIAL\nELECTIONS GO. THEY ARE DECIDED ON A RAZORS\nEDGE. EACH OF YOU COULD SWING AN\nENTIRE PRECINCT AND WIN WHICH ELECTION FOR LIRL HILLARY.\nBUT YOU COULD ALSO HELP SWING AN ENTIRE PRECINCT FOR HILLARY'S\nOPPONENT, WITH A PROTEST VOTE OR BY NOT VOTING AT ALL.\n>> TRUMP SAYING HE DOES SO MANY RALLIES, HILLARY IS HOME\nSLEEPING. OBVIOUSLY HYPERBOLE HERE.\nBUT HE DOES DO MORE RALLIES. BE DOES SHE NEED TO STEP IT UP\nIN THE LAST FEW DAYS? >> WELL CLEARLY SHE'S HAD REALLY\nPOWERFUL SURROGATES LIKE MICHELLE OBAMA OUT THERE HITTING\nTHAT BIG PROBLEM THAT SHE HAS WHICH HAS BEEN ENERGIZING\nMILLENNIALS AND GETTING THE DEMOCRATS WHO WOULD POTENTIALLY\nVOTE FOR A THIRD PARTY CANDIDATE TO COME BACK TO HER.\nTHE CAMPAIGN CLEARLY IS WORRIED ABOUT THAT.\nYOU SAW ROBBIE MOOK POUT A VIDEO THIS MORNING SAYING HEY THE\nPOLLS ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE. NOBODY STAY HOME.\nSO THEY REALLY ARE DRIVING THIS MESSAGE THAT EVERYONE NEEDS TO\nTURN OUT. AND I WILL SAY THAT THERE IS SO\nMUCH VARIATION IN ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT POLLS THAT WE'RE\nSEEING THAT THE ONLY THING THAT IS SAFE TO LOOK AT REALLY IS\nTHE -- POLLS, NATIONALLY. BUT YOU ARE SEEING SO MUCH\nVARIANCE THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE GOOD FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nBECAUSE IT MIGHT JOLT THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE GOING TO STAY\nHOME OUT TO THE POLLS. >> GOOD FOR HILLARY CLINTON OR\nPERHAPS INDICATIVE OF SOME REAL ISSUE WITH THE POLLS, WHICH IS\nTHE TRUMP ARGUMENT. WE SAW IT IN ENGLAND WITH THE\nBREXIT. WE SAW IT WITH FARK IN COLOMBIA.\nWOULD WE SEE IT HERE?",

THERE IS NO LEADERSHIP THERE.\nNOTHING ABOUT WHAT THEY HAVE DONE AND OTHERS HAVE DONE RINGS\nLEADERSHIP. AND YOU WONDER WHY THERE IS\nGRIDLOCK IN WASHINGTON. YOU WONDER WHY REPUBLICANS FOR\nTHE LAST EIGHT YEARS OF THE OBAMA PRESIDENCY HAVE BEEN THE\nPARTY OF NO. THEY ARE IN IT FOR THEMSELVES.\nNOT FOR PARTY OR FOR COUNTRY I WOULD ARGUE.\nAND THAT TO ME HAS REALLY BEEN THE PROBLEM IN THIS RACE.\nBECAUSE HOW IS IT THAT YOU CAN GET ON A SOAP BOX AND SAY I AM\nAGAINST EVERYTHING THIS MAN HAS SAID AND DONE, BUT I'M GOING\nVOTE FOR HIM AND I ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO THE SAME THING.\n>> I HATE TO SAY THIS BUT I AGREE WITH MOST OF WHAT BASIL\nJUST SAID. >> THANK YOU.\n>> I MEAN, YOU ARE IN TO BE A LEADER FOR HEAVEN SAKES.\nLEAD THE COUNTRY.

AND THEN, A FEW DAYS LATER,\nAFTER ALL THE OFFICIAL NUMBERS ARE TOGETHER AND AWE OF THE\nMAIL-IN BALLOTS ARE COUNTED AND EVERYTHING ELSE, WHAT YOU HEAR\nIS, NO, HILLARY CLINTON WON IT BY ONE.\nYOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS UNDER THAT\nCIRCUMSTANCE SAY, HEY, SOMETHING SUSPICIOUS HAPPENED HERE.\nI HEARD THAT NIGHT THAT HE WON AND NOW SHE WON.\nWAS SOMEBODY PLAYING WITH THE NUMBERS?\nWELL, THE ANSWER MIGHT BE THAT SOMEBODY WAS PLAYING WITH THE\nPRELIMINARY NUMBERS, BUT NOT WITH THE REAL NUMBERS\n>> RIGHT. DAVID SANGER, THANK YOU.\nSTEVEN LEVY, THANK YOU BOTH. WHEN WE HEAD BACK, WE'LL HEAD\nINSIDE THE TRUMP BUNKER FOR A LOOK AT THE CAMPAIGN'S DATA\nSHOP. AND IF YOU'RE WATCHING US IN\nWASHINGTON, D.C., YOU CAN LISTEN TO US ON BLOOMBERG 99.11 F.M.\nWE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.",

TELL US ABOUT YOUR STORY, SASHA.\n>> SO, JOSH AND I WENT DOWN TO SAN ANTONIO, WHERE THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN HAS BUILT BASICALLY A SECOND HEADQUARTERS.\nTHERE ARE PEOPLE WHO GO TO WORK IN AN OFFICE THAN GO TO TRUMP\nTOWER EVERY DAY AND IT'S WHERE TRUMP HAS BUILT THIS SORT OF\nDATA DIGITAL OPERATION THAT THEY'VE BEEN LOATHE TO TALK\nABOUT. HE GOT THROUGH THE PRIMARY BY\nDOING VERY LITTLE BEYOND TV INTERVIEWS, RALLIES, USING\nSOCIAL MEDIA, OUT OF HIS OWN ACCOUNT, AS A SORT OF BROADCAST\nMEDIUM. BUT SINCE HE GOT THE NOMINATION\nFROM JUNE ONWARD, THEY'VE BUILT A SYSTEM THAT'S DOING A LOT OF\nTARGETED COMMUNICATION AND COLLECTING A LOT OF INFORMATION\nON HIS SUPPORTERS. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THEY'VE\nPULLED BACK THE CURTAIN TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY'VE BEEN UP TO.\n>> ONE OF THE THINGS THE SENIOR OFFICIAL IS QUOTED IN THE STORY\nAS SAYING, IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S COME UP BEFORE, THE NOTION OF\nVOTER SUPPRESSION. HERE'S PART OF WHAT YOU WRITE IN\nTHE PIECE, IN \"BUSINESSWEEK.\" A SENIOR AIDE SAYS, WE HAVE\nTHREE MAJOR VOTER SUPPRESSION OPERATIONS UNDERWAY.\nTHEY'RE AIMED AT THREE GROUPS CLINTON NEEDS TO WIN\nOVERWHELMINGLY. IDEALISTIC WHITE LIBERALS AND\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN, AND WOMEN. CAMPAIGNS SOMETIMES ENGAGE IN\nVOTER SUPPRESSION, BUT WHY WOULD SOMEONE SAY THAT, GIVEN THE\nOPTICS OF IT? >> I THINK THIS IS EVIDENCE OF A\nCAMPAIGN THAT IS RUN BY A SORT OF TOP TIER OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE\nVERY LITTLE, IF ANY, EXPERIENCE AROUND POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS.\nYOU LOOK AT STEVE BANNON, JARED KUSHNER, BRAD PARSCALE, THE\nDIGITAL DIRECTOR OF THIS CAMPAIGN.\nTHESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE VERY LITTLE EXPERIENCE AT ALL.\nAND EVENING THEY'VE DEVELOPED A STRATEGY, WHICH IS SORT OF THE\nDUBIOUS FROM A SORT OF SCIENTIFIC PERSPECTIVE.\nBUT THEY HAVE NO IDEA HOW FRAUGHT THE TERM SUPPRESSION IS.\nTHEY THINK THAT WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS BASICALLY GOING TO THE\nMOST UNRELIABLE PARTS OF THE DEMOCRATIC COALITION, THESE\nGROUPS THAT WERE -- YOU HAVE A LOT OF VOTERS WHO WERE NOT\nREGULAR VOTERS AND WHERE POLLS SHOW NOT A LOT OF ENTHUSIASM FOR\nHILLARY CLINTON OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR.\nAND THEY THINK THAT IF THEY GIVE THEM NEGATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT\nHILLARY CLINTON, IT WILL KEEP THEM HOME.\nTHAT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN I THINK WHAT THE TERM SUPPRESSION\nMEANS LEGALLY, BUT THE FACT THAT THEY THREW THAT AROUND AS FREELY\nAS THEY DID WITH US I THINK IS A SIGN THAT THEY DON'T COME OUT OF\nA POLITICAL MILIEU THAT -- >> YOU DON'T NEED TO BE A\nPOLITICAL EXPERT, YOU JUST HAVE TO HAVE SOME SENSE OF MORALITY\nAND PR TO NOT SAY THAT TO A JOURNALIST.\n>> YEAH, I MEAN, THIS GROWS OUT OF BASICALLY THEIR STRATEGIC\nASSUMPTION AT THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN, WHICH IS THAT THEY\nHAVE THIS VERY FERVENT BASE, YOU KNOW, THE THING THAT'S GETTING\nTHEM TO 42 OR 43 OR 44% IN STATE POLLS.\nTHEY RECOGNIZE THAT THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH FOR A\nPLURALITY IN ENOUGH STATES TO GET 270 ELECTORAL VOTES.\nSO THEIR STRATEGIC ASSUMPTION AT THIS POINT IS, THE ONLY WAY THEY\nCAN TURN THEIR COALITION INTO A WINNING NUMBER IS TO SHRINK THE\nSIZE OF THE ELECTORATE. AND THIS IS THEIR GAMBIT TO GO\nAFTER GROUPS THAT THEY -- WHAT DO THEY THINK THEY HAVE THE MOST\nCHANCE TO REDUCE TURNOUT AMONG DEMOCRATS?\n>> SASHA, YOUR PIECE IS PRETTY UNAMBIGUOUS AMONG TWO THINGS.\nONE, THEY UNDERSTAND THEY'RE ALMOST CERTAIN TO LOSE.\nAND TWO, THAT THEY HAVE LONGER TERM AMBITIONS ALONG THE LINES A\nLOT OF PEOPLE EXPECT. TRYING TO BUILD SOME KIND OF\nMEDIA OPERATION ON THE BACK OF THIS MOVEMENT.\nTALK ABOUT THAT. >> SO, TRUMP HAS GIVEN THE\nINDICATION THAT HE DOESN'T MUCH TRUST POLLING.\nTHEY'RE DOING A TON OF IT, FROM A LOT OF DIFFERENT PLACES.\nEVERY NIGHT, THEY RUN ELECTORAL SIMULATIONS THAT PREDICT THEIR\nLIKELIHOOD OF WINNING. AND WE QUOTE IN THE PIECE, THE\nDIGITAL DIRECTOR, SAYING THAT BASICALLY THEIR NUMBERS ARE\nTRACKING NATE SILVER'S AT 538, BUT WITH A LAG BECAUSE THEY'RE\nNOT RELYING ON PUBLIC POLLS. THEY KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE\nAND WHAT COMES AFTER IS PROBABLY EITHER A SPLINTER POLITICAL\nMOVEMENT OR THE SORT OF TRUMP MEDIA PROPERTY THAT WE'VE ALL\nBEEN TALKING ABOUT, AND THEY WILL HAVE 13 MILLION NAMES\nTHEY'VE COLLECTED OVER THE COURSE OF THIS YEAR TO BE AN\nAUDIENCE OR A CONSTITUENCY FOR EITHER.\n>> ALL RIGHT.

WELL, WITH THE FIRST LADY, YOU\nHAVE HER INSPIRING YOUNG PEOPLE TO VOTE WITH A CALL FOR MORAL\nCLARITY. WITH THE FORMER SPEAKER, YOU\nHAVE HIM BASHING A TV NEWS ANCHOR.\nAND TODAY, MICHELLE OBAMA TOOK THE STAGE IN NORTH CAROLINA.\nTHE CAMPAIGN WITH HILLARY CLINTON, IN FRONT OF 11,000\nPEOPLE, SHE PRAISED CLINTON, THE FIRST LADY, TOOK SOME JABS AT\nDONALD TRUMP, AND MADE A CASE FOR AMERICAN GREATNESS.\nHERE SHE IS. >> SHE HAS MORE EXPERIENCE AND\nEXPOSURE TO THE PRESIDENCY THAN ANY CANDIDATE IN OUR LIFETIME.\nMORE THAN BARACK, MORE THAN BILL.\nSHE IS ABSOLUTELY READY TO BE COMMANDER IN CHIEF ON DAY ONE.\nAND YES, SHE HAPPENS TO BE A WOMAN.\nWE WANT A PRESIDENT WHO TAKES THIS JOB SERIOUSLY.\nAND HAS THE TEMPERAMENT AND MATURITY TO DO IT WELL.\nBECAUSE WE WANT TO GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT KNOWING THAT OUR KIDS\nAND OUR COUNTRY ARE SAFE. IT'S A COUNTRY WHERE A GIRL LIKE\nME FROM THE SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO, WHOSE GREAT, GREAT\nGRANDFATHER WAS A SLAVE, CAN GO TO THE FINEST UNIVERSITIES ON\nEARTH. A COUNTRY WHERE THE DAUGHTER OF\nAN ORPHAN CAN BREAK THAT HIGHEST AND HARDEST GLASS CEILING AND\nBECOME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\n>> TALK ABOUT POLITICAL ABILITY. I'VE NEVER SEEN IT QUITE AS GOOD\nAS THE FIRST LADY. EARLIER IN THE WEEK, NEWT\nGINGRICH WENT TO WAR WITH FOX NEWS'S MEGYN KELLY.\nHE WAS THEN CONGRATULATED FOR HIS PERFORMANCE BY DONALD TRUMP.\nLET'S WATCH THAT PERFORMANCE. >> IF TRUMP IS A SEXUAL\nPREDATOR, THAT IS -- >> HE'S NOT A SEXUAL PREDATOR --\n>> OKAY, THAT'S YOUR OPINION. >> I'M SICK AND TIRED OF PEOPLE\nLIKE YOU USING LANGUAGE THAT'S INFLAMMATORY THAT'S NOT TRUE.\nCAN WE GO BACK TO THE TAPES OF YOUR SHOW, RECENTLY.\nYOU ARE FASCINATED WITH SEX AND YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT PUBLIC\nPOLICY. >> ME?\nREALLY? >> THAT'S WHAT I GET OUT OF\nWATCHING YOU TONIGHT. >> CONGRATULATIONS, NEWT, ON\nLAST NIGHT. THAT WAS AN AMAZING INTERVIEW.\nWE DON'T PLAY GAMES, RIGHT? WE DON'T PLAY GAMES.\n>> OH, YEAH? THAT WAS THE LATEST EXAMPLE OF A\nCAMPAIGN THAT SOME REPUBLICANS SAY IS DRIVING AWAY WOMEN FROM\nTHE PARTY. DON'T JUST LIMIT IT TO WOMEN,\nANYWAY. ACCORDING TO THE \"WASHINGTON\nPOST\" TODAY, A GROWING NUMBER OF PROMINENT REPUBLICAN WOMEN ARE\nWORRIED THAT AS MEMBERS OF THEIR MALE-DOMINATED PARTY STEP UP TO\nDEFEND DONALD TRUMP AGAINST ACCUSATIONS FROM SEXUAL ASSAULT,\nTHEY ARE CAUSING A IRREPARABLE DAMAGE TO THE GOP'S\nDETERIORATING RELATIONSHIP WITH FEMALE VOTERS.\nIRONICALLY, CONTINUING WITH THE POST, IRONICALLY, IT IS TRUMP'S\nCANDIDATES RATHER THAN HILLARY CLINTON'S THAT HAS BROUGHT\nSEXISM TO THE FOREFRONT OF POLITICAL DEBATE.\nKATIE PACKER, SHE WAS ON THE SHOW RECENTLY, THE DEPUTY\nMANAGING CAMPAIGN MANAGER FOR MITT ROMNEY'S 2012 CAMPAIGN TOLD\n\"THE WASHINGTON POST,\" QUOTE, FOR NEXT-GENERATION PROFESSIONAL\nWOMEN, THE PARTY'S GOING TO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING VERY, VERY\nDRASTIC TO CHANGE THE COURSE OF WHERE THIS CANDIDATE HAS TAKEN\nUS. WELL, HOW MUCH DAMAGE IS IT?\nWE'VE WATCHED A LOT OF THIS AND SHOWN YOU THE EXHIBITS ON BOTH\nSIDES. JOINING ME RIGHT NOW, MICHAEL\nSTEELE, THE FORMER CHAIR OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE.\nHE'S AN MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST. AUTHOR, RON REAGAN, ALSO AN\nMSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST. AND MOLLY BALL, STAFF WRITER FOR\nTHE ATLANTIC. MOLLY, I WANT TO DEFER TO THE\nFORMER CHAIR OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY FIRST.\nI KNOW IT'S A WOMEN'S ISSUE, BUT I'VE GOT TO ASK MICHAEL.\nTHIS IS THE CRAZIEST, CRAZIEST JUXTAPOSITION.\nTHERE YOU HAVE THE MOST DASH -- YOU'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL HOW YOU\nSAY THINGS, BEAUTIFUL FIRST LADY, ATTRACTIVE, DYNAMITE\nSPEAKER, INCREDIBLY POLISHED, IVY LEAGUER IN EVERY POSSIBLE\nGOOD SENSE OF THAT WORD, CHARMING, PERSUASIVE, A ROLE\nMODEL FOR EVERYONE, MALE AND FEMALE, OF EVERY BACKGROUND.\nAND THEN YOU HAVE NEWT GINGRICH DUKING IT OUT IN THIS SIDE SHOW\nALONG THE GANGWAY OF SOME CIRCUS THAT THEY'RE RUNNING AGAINST\nMEGYN KELLY, WHO IS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR CONSERVATIVE\nANCHORS WE'VE EVER SEEN. WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOUR AT\nLEAST CURRENT OR ERSTWHILE POLITICAL PARTY, AT LEAST?\nI DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU STAND. WHY ARE THEY SUCH FOOLS?\n>> THIS IS A PARTY THAT IS ACTUALLY OUTSIDE OF ITSELF RIGHT\nNOW. IT HAS NO ORIENTING MOORINGS.\nIT'S NOT MOORED TO ANY IDEA OR ANY PARTICULAR LEADER IN THE\nSENSE THAT YOU HAVE THE CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP THAT'S\nGOING IN ONE DIRECTION, THE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP GOING IN\nANOTHER. AND YOU HAVE THE NOMINEE OF THE\nPARTY THAT HAS REALLY NOT LAID O OUT A DIRECTION.\nSO YOU HAVE THIS MOMENT, THIS QUINTESSENTIAL MOMENT, WHERE ALL\nTHE WORK THAT THE PARTY HAS PUT IN OVER THE YEARS TO CAPTIVATE\nTHE IMAGINATIONS OF WOMEN, AFRICAN-AMERICANS, HISPANICS,\nALL OF THAT'S FOR NAUGHT. AND IT'S ALL BEING LOST, NOT IN\nA MATTER OF YEARS, BUT IN A MATTER OF WEEKS.\nIN THE LAST FEW WEEKS, THIS SORT OF DUMBING DOWN OF THE POLITICAL\nPROCESS BY PARTY LEADERS AND OTHERS, HAS JUST BEEN STUNNING.\nAND THE WOMEN OF THE PARTY, IN THIS HOUR SAYING, ENOUGH.\nAND MY VIEW, IT'S ABOUT TIME. I WANT MORE OF THOSE VOICES TO\nCOME OUT TO SEND THE CLARION CALL THAT THIS PARTY IS GOING TO\nREQUIRE DIFFERENT LEADERSHIP AND A DIFFERENT DIRECTION AFTER THIS\nELECTION. >> MOLLY, I HAVE A PLAN FOR YOU\nTO GET INTO THE FRONT PAGES OF THE NEWSPAPER, WHETHER YOU WANT\nIT OR NOT. JUST GET IN FOUR FEET OF DONALD\nTRUMP. DID YOU SEE DANA BASH THE OTHER\nDAY? HE CALLED HER INSULTING BECAUSE\nSHE ASKED HIM ABOUT WHY HE WAS TAKING TIME FROM THE CAMPAIGN TO\nGO OPEN UP A HOTEL. IT WAS A FAIR QUESTION.\nOF COURSE, IT WAS A LITTLE BIT PROVOCATIVE, BUT THAT'S THE IDEA\nOF THESE QUESTIONS, YOU PROVOKE THE CANDIDATE.\nAND HE WAS PROVOKED. ANYWAY, YOUR THOUGHTS?\n>> LOOK, I DON'T SPEAK FOR ALL WOMEN, OBVIOUSLY, BUT THE WOMEN\nWHO ARE PRONOUNCING THEMSELVES DIVORCED FROM THE REPUBLICAN\nPARTY, PROMINENT WOMEN, WOMEN WHO ARE REPUBLICAN POLITICAL\nPROFESSIONALS, THEY'RE NOT DOING THIS BECAUSE THEY DISAGREE WITH\nREPUBLICAN POSITIONS. THEY WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE THERE\nTO BE A CONSERVATIVE PARTY THAT WOMEN CAN BE A PART OF.\nA PARTY THAT IS PRO-LIFE, A PARTY FOR SMALL GOVERNMENT.\nTHEY ARE NOT BECOMING LIBERALS, RIGHT?\nIF THEY'RE VOTING FOR THE DEMOCRAT, IT'S BECAUSE THEY FEEL\nTHEY'VE BEEN FORCED TO BY, A AS CHAIRMAN STEEL WAS SAYING, A\nREPUBLICAN PARTY THAT HAS SIGNALED IT DOESN'T WANT TO\nRESPECT WOMEN AS HUMAN BEINGS. SO IT'S A TOUGH DECISION FOR A\nLOT OF THESE WOMEN AND I THINK THERE IS POTENTIALLY LONG-TERM\nDAMAGE WITHOUT NEW LEADERSHIP. THAT BEING SAID, I THINK THERE\nARE A LOT OF CONSERVATIVE WOMEN OUT THERE WHO WOULD RESPOND VERY\nPOSITIVELY TO FUTURE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE WHO WAS ABLE TO MAKE\nMORE POLITE OVERTURES. >> WHAT HAPPENED TO THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY THAT LOOKED UP, AND I MEAN, REALLY LOOKED UP TO\nMARGARET THATCHER? BIG-TIME.\nSHE WAS THE ROLE MODEL FOR WHAT A CONSERVATIVE WOMAN WOULD BE.\nAND NOW IT'S THE PARTY THAT -- I DON'T WANT TO SAY.\nLET ME GO TO RON ON THIS, WHO HAS SOME EXPERIENCE.\nYOUR FATHER'S BEST FRIEND IN POLITICS WAS THIS VERY STRONG\nLEADER, LEADER OF MEN AND WOMEN, NOT SOMEBODY TO BE TREATED THE\nWAY ANYBODY SHOULD BE TREATED, BUT NOW YOU SEE THESE SIDE\nFIGHTS. I MEAN, WHY IS NEWT GINGRICH\nFIGHTING WITH MEGYN KELLY? JUST MOVE ON!\nDUST IT OFF. SAY SOMETHING.\n>> WELL, LET ME MAKE ONE POINT, FIRST.\nAND THAT IS, THAT WE TEND TO CHARACTERIZE THESE ISSUES OF\nSEXUAL HARASSMENT AND SEXUAL ASSAULT, IN THIS CASE, AS\nWOMEN'S ISSUES. THEY'RE NOT WOMEN'S ISSUES.\nIF ANYTHING, THEY'RE MEN'S ISSUES.\nMEN ARE THE ONES, GENERALLY SPEAKING, DOING THESE -- THE\nHARASSING AND THE ASSAULTING. BUT THEY'RE HUMAN ISSUES.\nNOW, AS FAR AS NEWT GINGRICH GOES, REALLY, COULD YOU ASK FOR\nA WORSE PERSON TO BE DISCUSSING ISSUES LIKE THIS?\nTHIS GUY'S BEEN MARRIED THREE TIMES, CHEATED ON HIS FIRST TWO\nWIVES, TOLD UP WITH OF HIS WIVES SHE HAD A CHOICE, A DIVORCE OR\nAN OPEN MARRIAGE, WAS IMPEACHING WITH BILL CLINTON FOR HAVING A\nCONSENSUAL AFFAIR WHILE HAVING AN AFFAIR HIMSELF.\nAND REALLY, WORSE THAN THAT, REALLY, CONFLATES THE TWO ISSUE\nOF SEXUAL",

      "text": ">>> HILLARY CLINTON AND MICHELLE\nOBAMA CAMPAIGNING TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST TIME.\nTHE FIRST LADY FIRED UP A CROWD IN NORTH CAROLINA, SAYING\nCLINTON HAS MORE EXPERIENCE THAN ANYONE ELSE TO BE PRESIDENT OF\nTHE UNITED STATES. LET'S GET SOME MORE WITH OUR\nPOLITICAL EXPERTS. WE'RE HERE WITH GLORIA BORGER.\nEVENTS LIKE THIS, THE STAR POWER OF MICHELLE OBAMA, IS THAT WHAT\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN NEEDS RIGHT NOW TO PREVENT COMPLACENCY?\n>> ABSOLUTELY. LET'S JUST SAY THAT MICHELLE\nOBAMA GETS THE SURROGATE OF THE YEAR AWARD, BECAUSE SHE CAN\nBRING OUT THE CROWDS. IT WAS A VERY BIG CROWD THERE\nTODAY. I THINK THE FIRST OR SECOND\nLARGEST OF THE YEAR. AND SHE NOT ONLY CAN GET PEOPLE\nMOTIVATED TO VOTE, BUT HER MESSAGE TODAY WAS VERY CLEAR.\nSHE SAID, THEY ARE TRYING TO CONVINCE YOU TO STAY HOME, THAT\nTHEY ARE -- THEIR STRATEGY IS TO MAKE THIS ELECTION SO UGLY THAT\nYOU WON'T WANT ANY PART OF IT. SO SHE KIND OF HIT THE VOTER\nSUPPRESSION ISSUE RIGHT ON THE HEAD, AND SAID TO VOTERS, IN\nTHAT IMPORTANT STATE, WHICH IS CLOSE, YOU CANNOT STAY HOME\nANYMORE, AND REMINDED PEOPLE THAT IN THE YEAR 2008, WHEN HER\nHUSBAND WON THAT STATE, IT WAS BY 14,000 VOTES, WHICH IS TWO\nPER DISTRICT. SO SHE CAN REALLY DRIVE THAT\nMESSAGE HOME. AND OTHER SURROGATES CAN DO THE\nSAME. IF HILLARY CLINTON DOESN'T GET\nTHEM ENTHUSED, THEY WILL TRY. >> WE'RE LOOKING AT A NEW POLL\nOUT TODAY FROM QUINNIPIAC IN NORTH CAROLINA.\nHILLARY CLINTON 47%, DONALD TRUMP 43%.\nGARY JOHNSON, 5%. IF THAT POLL IS ACCURATE, HOW\nDOES TRUMP CATCH UP? >> I THINK TRUMP IS REALLY JUST\nAT THIS POINT GOING TO HAVE TO EITHER STAY ON A COUPLE OF\nMESSAGES THAT SEEM TO RESONATE FOR HIM, LIKE THE OBAMA CARE\nPREMIUM NUMBERS, TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE CORE ISSUES THAT\nMATTER TO HIS VOTERS LIKE IMMIGRATION.\nIF HE GETS SIDETRACKED, I DON'T SEE HOW HE MAKES IT UP IN A\nNATIONAL POLL. I THINK HE'S GOT TO CONCENTRATE\nON THE SWING STATES. THE NATIONAL POLL NUMBERS ARE\nMEANING LESS AND LESS. >> HE WAS VERY DISCIPLINED TODAY\nIN SPEECHES SO FAR, WITH ANOTHER ONE COMING UP LATER IN OHIO.\nTWO OTHER INTRIGUING POLLS IN IOWA.\nHILLARY CLINTON 44%, TRUMP 44%. A MONTH AGO, HILLARY CLINTON WAS\nDOWN IN IOWA BY ABOUT SEVEN POINTS.\nAND IN GEORGIA, WHICH IS A TRADITIONALLY RED STATE IN A\nPRESIDENTIAL CONTEST, TRUMP 44%, HILLARY CLINTON 43%.\nSHE WAS DOWN SEVEN POINTS A MONTH AGO IN THE SAME POLL IN\nGEORGIA, AS WELL. IT LOOKS LIKE THAT'S A\nNARROWING, IF THERE'S A NARROWING IN GEORGIA OF ALL\nPLACES, TRUMP IS IN TROUBLE. >> RIGHT, ABSOLUTELY.\nWE HAVE SEEN IN THE NATIONAL POLLING A KIND OF RETURN TO THE\nMEAN A LITTLE BIT IN THE LAST FEW DAYS WITH THE NUMBERS COMING\nDOWN TO WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN. BUT BOTH OF THESE RESULTS SHOW\nTHE LIMITS OF THAT. THERE ARE TWO IMPORTANT POINTS.\nFIRST OF ALL, NEITHER OF THESE ARE STATES THAT HILLARY CLINTON\nHAS TO WIN IN ORDER TO WIN. THEY ARE STATES THAT DONALD\nTRUMP HAS TO WIN AND HE'S STRUGGLING IN THEM.\nTHE OTHER THING THAT'S STRUGGLING IS THESE ARE STATES\nIN EACH OF THE TWO -- IOWA IS PROBABLY THE RUST BELT SWING\nSTATE WHERE DONALD TRUMP HAS HAD THE BEST CHANCE.\nIT'S HEAVILY BLUE COLLAR, PREDOMINANTLY WHITE STATE.\nIF THE MARGIN FALLS THERE, HILLARY CLINTON IS AHEAD AMONG\nCOLLEGE WHITES, IT IS DIFFICULT FOR HIM IN THE OTHER RUST BELT\nSWING STATES THAT ARE LESS AMENABLE TO HIM.\nAND GEORGIA IS REALLY OUTSIDE OF THE BORDER OF WHAT WE THOUGHT\nOF. YOU HAVE NORTH CAROLINA,\nVIRGINIA, COLORADO, NEVADA AND FLORIDA.\nGEORGIA IS A STEP BEHIND. AND SHE'S UP 12 POINTS IN\nVIRGINIA IN THAT POLL. >> IT SEEMS THAT THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN STRATEGY IS TO SOMEHOW DECREASE -- FOR HILLARY CLINTON\nBY RAISING ALL THESE ISSUES, INCLUDING THESE WIKILEAKS\nE-MAILS THAT HAVE BEEN HACKED. >> THE STRATEGY DESCRIBED IN\nTHAT BLOOMBERG STORY IS LIKE VOTER DEPRESSION MORE THAN VOTER\nSUPPRESSION. THEY KNOW THINGS AREN'T GOING\nWELL. GEORGIA IS IN PLAY, THINGS ARE\nNOT GOING WELL IN TEXAS OF ALL PLACES.\nTHEY ARE DESPERATE AND LOOKING TO DO ANYTHING THEY CAN TO\nCHANGE THE TIDE. >> CAN THEY DO THAT, GLORIA?\n>> WE'LL HAVE TO SEE. I MEAN, I WAS TALKING TO\nSOMEBODY IN THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN TODAY WHO WAS SAYING LOOK, THEY\nDON'T EXPECT TO WIN GEORGIA. THEY REALLY DON'T.\nBUT THE QUESTION OF NORTH CAROLINA IS INTERESTING, BECAUSE\nWILL NORTH CAROLINA START TO LOOK MORE AND MORE LIKE THE\nSTATE OF VIRGINIA WHERE THEY'RE VERY MUCH AHEAD?\nYOU HAVE THE RESEARCH TRIANGLE. THERE ARE A LOT OF VOTERS THEY\nBELIEVE THAT THEY CAN APPEAL TO THERE.\nAND THAT IS A STATE THAT IS CHANGING, AND SO THEY'RE VERY\nINTERESTED, OF COURSE, BECAUSE THEY WANT TO WIN IT.\nBUT THEY'RE VERY INTERESTED IN THE TIGHTENING OF THE POLLS\nTHERE, VIS-A-VIE THE STATE OF VIRGINIA, WHICH ISN'T EVEN\nENDOWED ANYMORE. >> YEAH, IT'S BASICALLY THE\nSAME. IN ALL OF THE SUN BELT STATES,\nYOU SEE THE SAME COALITION CONSOLIDATING, ACCELERATING WHAT\nWE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST 16 YEARS SINCE 2000.\nIN VIRGINIA ALREADY, THE COMBINATION OF COLLEGE EDUCATED\nWHITES AND MINORITIES HAVE TIPPED THE STATE TO THE\nDEMOCRATS. HILLARY CLINTON IS UP DOUBLE\nDIGITS AMONG THE COLLEGE WHITES. IN NORTH CAROLINA IN THIS POLL,\nSHE'S BASICALLY EVEN AMONG COLLEGE WHITES.\nAND THAT IS ENOUGH TO GIVE HER A SLIGHT ADVANTAGE.\nBUT IT PUTS NORTH CAROLINA ON THE SAME CONTINUIUM THAT WE'VE\nSEEN IN VIRGINIA AND COLORADO. IF DEMOCRATS CAN SUSTAIN THAT\nTHROUGH THIS ELECTION AND BEYOND, IT TILTS THE ELECTORAL\nCOLLEGE MAP. GEORGIA AND ARIZONA ARE ONE STEP\nBEHIND WITH THE SAME DEMOGRAPHIC MIX.\nBUT JUST NOT QUITE AS MUCH DEMOCRATIC STRENGTH WITH COLLEGE\nWHITES YET. >> STAND BY, MUCH MORE COMING\nUP. MORE STOLEN CLINTON CAMPAIGN\nE-MAILS HAVE BEEN REVEALED. SHOULD HILLARYN?NT",

THE COMPANY IS GROWING ITS USER\nBASE AND RATIONALIZING ITS GLOBAL FOOTPRINT.\nTHE LIVING SOCIAL DEAL WILL MAKE IT HARDER FOR THEM TO TURN A\nPROFIT AT LEAST IN THE NEAR TERM.\nI THINK THE REAL REASON THE STOCK GOT HIT TODAY IS IT HAD\nRUN UP DRAMATICALLY GOING INTO THE QUARTER.\nIN OTHER WORDS, IT WAS PRICED FOR PERFECTION AND WHAT WE GOT\nWAS MERELY GOOD. SHE WE VIEW THIS AS A POTENTIAL\nBUYING OPPORTUNITY OR DO WE NEED TO WORRY THE TURN AROUND IS\nRUNNING OUT OF STEAM. LET'S CHECK IN WITH RICH\nWILLIAMS. MR. WILLIAMS, WELCOME TO \"MAD\nMONEY.\" GOOD TO SEE YOU SIR.\n>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME. >> YOU HEARD WHAT I JUST SAID.\nHONESTLY I SPENT MOST OF THE DAY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT\nEVERYBODY HATES ABOUT IT, AND I DECIDED THERE WASN'T ANYTHING\nEXCEPT FOR THE FACT IT HAD GONE UP A LOT, AND PEOPLE THOUGHT\nTHIS IS TIME TO BE ABLE TO RING THE REGISTER.\n>> YOUR GUESS IS AS GOOD AS MINE ON THAT ONE.\nI LOOKED AT IT. IT'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT\nCONFUSING. WE HAD A STRONG PERFORMANCE, AS\nYOU SAID, AND THE FUNDAMENTALS IN THE BUSINESS ARE SHOWING\nGREAT PROGRESS. AS WE LOOK AT OUR EXECUTION\nAGAINST OUR STRATEGY, WE'D SAY WE'RE ON TRACK.\nSO, YOU KNOW, I THINK MAYBE THERE WAS SOME FAST MONEY MOVING\nOUT AND SOME PERFECTION EXPECTED.\n>> RIGHT. >> BUT I THINK WE DELIVERED\nSOLID RESULTS. .\n>> LOOK, I THOUGHT TYPICAL FOR THE RESEARCH, CREDIT SUISSE DID\nA GOOD JOB. THEY SAID, IN LINE THIRD\nQUARTER, RESULTS, EXPECT GRADUAL PROGRESS ON TURN AROUND.\nI THINK PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED INSTANT TURN AROUND.\nYOU HAVE NEVER PROMISED THAT.  I'M A PRACTICAL GUY.\nMOST PEOPLE THAT SET OUT ON THE MAGNITUDE OF CHANGE THAT WE SET\nOUT END UP HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ROADS TO RECOVERY THAT ARE\nYEARS LONG. WHEN WE SET OUT, WE SAID THIS\nWASN'T GOING TO BE INSTANT. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE SIMPLE.\nBUT IN THAT PATH, WE'VE ALSO DELIVERED NOW FOUR QUARTERS OF\nREALLY STEADY PROGRESS. YOU LOOK AT OUR NORTH AMERICAN\nLOCAL BUSINESS, OUR CORE BUSINESS, ACCELERATING OVER THE\nLAST THREE QUARTERS. I'D SAY MOST PEOPLE AGAIN -- AND\nTHAT'S BASED ON SAYING THIS IS GOING TO TAKE A WHILE -- BUT\nYOU'RE GOING TO SEE PROGRESS ALONG THE WAY.\nWE'VE BEEN CLEAR ABOUT THAT. >> YOU MADE THE ACQUISITION OF\nLIVING SOCIAL. >> YEAH.\n>> YOU SAID I THINK PRETTY MUCH WHEN I ASKED YOU THIS,\nUNDISCLOSED SUM. BUT TO SOME, THAT WAS RATHER\nRADICAL. I THINK THE MORE RADICAL THING\nWAS TO BE ABLE TO SELL SOME THINGS THAT YOU OWNED OR SHUT\nTHINGS THAT YOU OWNED AND THAT LIVING SOCIAL ACTUALLY FITS INTO\nYOUR CORE MISSION. >> I AGREE WITH YOU.\nWHEN I TOOK OVER THE JOB NOW A YEAR AGO, I BASICALLY SAID,\nLOOK, WE'RE GOING TO DO FOUR THINGS.\nWE'RE GOING TO SIMPLIFY OUR LIVES.\n>> AND YOU DID HAVE A LOT OF STUFF THAT WAS HARD TO\nUNDERSTAND. >> WE HAD A LOT OF STUFF.\nONE OF THOSE KEY STRATEGIC PILLARS WAS SIMPLIFY AND\nSTREAMLINE THE BUSINESS. THAT MEANT REMOVING SOME\nBUSINESSES THAT WEREN'T CORE. >> OKAY.\n>> AND WHEN WE DID THAT, WE ALSO SAID WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO\nBE TUNISTIC ON M&A, WE BELIEVE WE CAN DO BOTH.\nWE BELIEVE WE CAN BE SMART OPERATORS AND ALSO ACQUIRE\nCOMPANIES AS LONG AS THEY PASS A VERY HIGH BAR.\nTHAT HIGH BAR WAS AGAIN SIMPLE. IT SAID THEY HAVE TO BE ON\nSTRATEGY. >> WHICH LIVING SOCIAL\nCERTAINLY. >> IT HAS TO BE DOWN THE MIDDLE\nWITH WHERE OUR FOCUS AREAS ARE AND THAT'S NORTH AMERICAN LOCAL.\nTHAT PASSES THAT BAR. >> WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT THE\nREASON I MENTION THAT IS I WAS LOOKING AT YOUR CASH POSITION.\nYOU HAVE $870 MILLION, ALMOST 40% OF USUAL MARKET CAP.\nI HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT WAS DINGED SUBSTANTIALLY BY BUYING\nLIVING SOESHLG. >> IT WAS A NON-MATERIAL\nACQUISITION. SO, YOU KNOW, WE LOOK AT THAT IN\nMULTIPLE WAYS, BOTH THE FINANCIAL SIDE AND NOW WITH WHAT\nWE KNOW ABOUT INTEGRATING BUSINESSES AND OPERATING THIS\nBUSINESS WELL, WE DON'T SEE IT AS A MATERIAL DISTRACTION FROM\nOUR DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS. WE VERY MUCH LOOK AT THIS DEAL\nAS CAN WE ACQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS AT A COST OF\nACQUISITION THAT WE THINK IS EFFECTIVE?\n>> THIS WAS A MORE INTERNAL INVESTMENT ACQUISITION.\nYOU MADE A DECISION THAT -- >> I MEAN WE LOOK AT IT JUST\nLIKE ANY CUSTOMER ACQUISITION, 12 TO 18 MONTH HORIZON, IS IT\nGOING TO PAY US BACK ON A GROSS PROFIT BASIS.\nIN THIS CASE, WE FEEL STRONGLY THAT IT WILL.\n>> YOU MUST FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT ADVERTISING ON TV BECAUSE I'M\nSEEING THOSE. >> WE DO.\nWE DO. WE'VE BEEN QUIET IN THAT WORLD\nFOR YEARS. AND I THINK, YOU KNOW, IT WAS\nTIME TO GET BACK ON THE AIR. IT WAS TIME TO START EDUCATING\nPEOPLE ABOUT HOW GROUPON HAS CHANGED.\nWE'VE SEEN GREAT RESPONSE TO THAT.\n>> YOU HAVE. TELL ME WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT.\n>> WE'VE SEEN THAT IT CAN BE AN EFFECTIVE CUSTOMER ACQUISITION\nCHANNEL FOR US. WHEN I SAY EFFECTIVE, I'M\nPUTTING THE BRAND STUFF ASIDE. I'M SAYING IF WE MEASURE IT AND\nWE -- DO WE SEE THE ROI WE NEED TO SEE.\nWE MEASURE IT LIKE EFRL CHANNEL WE OPERATE IT.\nWE CAN ACQUIRE A GOOD SIZE NUMBER OF CHARACTERS AT AN ROI\nTHAT WE THINK IS REALLY SOLID. WE TREAT IT LIKE EVERY CHANNEL\nWE OPERATE IN, AND IT HAS THAT EXTRA BENEFIT OF TEACHING PEOPLE\nWHAT'S NEW AT GROUPON. >> RICH, YOU'RE A REGULAR GUY,\nAND YOU'RE ONE GUY TRYING TO TURN AROUND A BIG COMPANY.\nI WONDER EVEN IF THERE WERE TERRIFIC -- AND I KNOW YOU'RE\nGOING TO SAY THERE ARE -- INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WOULD IT\nBE BETTER JUST -- BECAUSE THE THING GOT SO FAR FLUNG.\nJUST SAY, OKAY, LISTEN, I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON DOMESTICS\nBECAUSE THE OPPORTUNITY IS PRETTY GREAT DOMESTICALLY.\n>> I MEAN WE WENT THROUGH EVERY COUNTRY THAT WE OPERATE IN, AND\nWE PUT THEM THROUGH WHAT I THINK IS THE RIGHT FRAMEWORK.\nWE BASICALLY SAID DO WE HAVE A STRONG COMPETITIVE POSITION IN\nTHE MARKET? DOES THE MARKET HAVE\nCHARACTERISTICS THAT WE LIKE? DOES IT HAVE STRONG MOBILE\nPENETRATION? IS IT A CONNECTED MARKET.\nDO WE BELIEVE WE HAVE INVESTMENT CHARACTERISTICS THAT MAKE SENSE\nTHERE? DO WE THINK WE COULD WIN?\nWHERE WE DIDN'T THINK WE COULD WIN, WE MADE THE HARD CALL, CUT\nTHEM OUT. WE THINK WE HAVE A GOOD WINNING\nFORMULA. WE BELIEVE THEY CAN SUPPORT\nINVESTMENT LONG TERM AND BE GOOD SOLID BUSINESSES.\n>> ONE LAST QUESTION. IT'S REALLY UNNERVING WHEN I\nMENTION GROUPON, YOU KNOW. I SAY I THINK THEY'VE BOTTOMED.\nPEOPLE SAID, JIM, GOOGLE COULD WRECK THEM IN A DAY.\n>> YEAH. >> THEY CAN PUT THEM OUT OF\nBUSINESS IN A DAY. WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU HEAR\nTHAT? >> I HEAR THAT ALL THE TIME.\n>> RIGHT? THAT'S THE RUB.\n>> AT LEAST I HEAR THAT IN THE MEDIA SIDE.\nI DON'T REALLY HEAR THAT FROM CUSTOMERS.\nBUT I THINK THE BIG THING YOU HAVE THERE IS CONTEXT.\nAND I THINK IT'S THE CHALLENGE THAT YOU HAVE WITH GOOGLE.\nYOU KNOW, WE OR ANYONE ELSE THAT HAS A DIFFERENT KIND OF CONTEXT,\nPEOPLE GO TO GOOGLE TO FIND STUFF.\nPEOPLE GO TO GROUPON TO BUY LOCALLY.\n>> RIGHT. IT'S DIFFERENT.\n>> IT'S A DIFFERENT ANIMAL. NOW, WE DON'T HAVE THEIR SCALE.\nWE'RE ACQUIRING SCALE AS FAST AS WE POSSIBLY CAN.\nBUT WHEN PEOPLE THINK OF GROUPON, THEY THINK I'M GOING TO\nGO FIND A GREAT RESTAURANT. I'M GOING TO GO FIND A GREAT\nSPA. I'M GOING TO DO SOMETHING WITH\nMY KIDS THIS WEEKEND. I'M GOING TO SAVE A TON OF\nMONEY. CHANGING THAT, INCREDIBLY HARD\nTO DO. >> WE'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT.\nYOU ANSWERED A LOT OF MY QUESTIONS.\nI REALLY APPRECIATE IT. THAT'S GROUPON'S CEO RICH\nWILLIAMS. I THINK THE STOCK IS REALLY INTERESTING DOWN SO BADLY TODAY\nBECAUSE THERE REALLY WASN'T ANYTHING THAT SHOULD MAKE IT GO\nDOWN LIKE THAT. \"MAD MONEY\" IS BACK AFTER THE\nBREAK. >> IT IS TIME!\nIT IS TIME FOR THE LIGHTNING ROUND!\nTHAT'S WHERE I TAKE YOUR CALLS RAPID FIRE.\nYOU TELL ME THE STOCK. I TELL YOU TO BUY, BUY, BUY OR\nSELL, SELL, SELL. WE'LL PLAY THIS SOUND --\n[ BUZZER ] -- AND THEN THE LIGHTNING ROUND\nIS OVER. ARE YOU READY, SKEE-DADDY?\nIT'S TIME FOR THE LIGHTNING ROUND ON CRAMER'S \"MAD MONEY.\"\nLET'S START WITH SCOTT IN NORTH DAKOTA, SCOTT.\n>> Caller: HELLO, JIM. >> YO, YO.\n>> Caller: HOW YOU DOING TODAY? >> GOOD.\nHOW ABOUT YOU? >> Caller: GOOD, GOOD.\nTHANKS FOR TAKING MY CALL AND THANKS FOR YOUR SHOW.\nI'VE LEARNED A LOT FROM YOU. >> THANK YOU.\n>> Caller: MY STOCK IS FIRE EYE. I KEEP ON BUYING IT AS IT'S\nGOING DOWN, AND IT'S REALLY DOWN THERE NOW.\n>> MAYBE AT SOME POINT. I CAN'T RECOMMEND THE STOCK ON A\nTAKEOVER BASIS BECAUSE THE FUNDAMENTALS AREN'T THAT GOOD.\nTHE ONE I'VE BEEN LIKING IS PROOFPOINT BECAUSE THAT DOES THE\nE-MAIL BLOCKAGE WHICH IS WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO WORRY ABOUT RIGHT\nNOW. CRAIG IN MINNESOTA, CRAIG.\n>> Caller: BIG BOOYAH FROM MINNESOTA THERE, JIM.\n>> ALL RIGHT. SORRY WE HAD TO BEAT THE VIKINGS\nLAST WEEKEND, BUT THAT'S SOMETIMES THE WAY IT IS.\nWHAT'S GOING ON? >> Caller: WELL, I GOT SHOPPER\nFLY, TICKER SYMBOL SHOP. >> YOU KNOW, IT'S UP TOO MUCH.\nIT'S UP TOO MUCH. IT'S UP 60%.\nTHAT MAKES ME NERVOUS. I KNOW IT'S DOING WELL, BUT IT\nIS UP TOO MUCH, AND I WANT TO BE A LITTLE CAUTIOUS HERE.\nLET'S GO TO RANDY IN NEW YORK, RANDY.\n>> Caller: THANKS FOR TAKING MY CALL.\n>> OF COURSE. >> Caller: I'M INTERESTED IN\nIMPEGY. BUY SELL OR HOLD.\n>> WE DID A PIECE SAYING IF IT PULLED BACK, WE WOULD BE A\nBUYER. IT'S PULLED BACK.\nIT'S GETTING KIND OF INTERESTING.\nHOW ABOUT ALEX IN CALIFORNIA, ALEX?\n>> Caller: BOOYAH, JIM. >> BOOYAH.\n>> Caller: HOW ABOUT SIGN DOZIER?\n>> NO. MY CHARITABLE TRUST OWNS\nALLERGAN. IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN THAT\nBUT ALLERGAN IS GOING TO COME DOWN A FEW MORE POINTS AS WE GET\nINTO THE ELECTION. DAVID IN MASSACHUSETTS, DAVID.\n>> Caller: JIM, BOOYAH. >> BOOYAH.\n>> Caller: I WAS WONDERING YOUR THOUGHTS ON ERII, IT'S BEEN\nPERFORMING WELL THE PAST YEAR BUT --\n>> YEAH. YOU KNOW, LET ME DO MORE WORK ON\nTHAT BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A FASCINATING COMPANY.\nWE GOT A LOT OF HOMEWORK TO DO. LET ME DO WORK ON THAT.\nGEORGE IN FLORIDA, GEORGE. >> Caller: HI.\nI WAS THINK -- WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT ZOE'S KITCHEN?\n>> ZOE'S KITCHEN DID NOT DO WHAT I WANTED, WHICH IS TO SAY NOT AS\nBAD AS I THOUGHT. I LIKE THE LONG TERM THESIS,\nTHOUGH. IF YOU HAVE THE PATIENCE FOR A\nYEAR, I THINK THAT ZOE'S IS GOING TO MAKE YOU MONEY BECAUSE\nIT'S FRESH FOOD, AND IT'S GOT A GREAT CONCEPT.\nBUT IT MIGHT TAKE A YEAR TO RECOVER BECAUSE WHEN THESE\nRESTAURANT STOCKS GO WRONG, THEY STAY DOWN.\nVIDULA IN CALIFORNIA, VIDULA. >> Caller: HI, JIM.\nNICE TALKING TO YOU. >> SAME.\n>> Caller: BUY MORE OR SELL? >> WE JUST HIT THE JACKPOT WITH\nNXP ON MY CHARITABLE TRUST. NOW I'M LOOKING AT NVIDIA.\nONE MORE CALL. CHARLIE IN VIRGINIA, CHARLIE.\n>> Caller: THANKS, JIM. I'M A LONG TIME FAN AND A FELLOW\nB AND B OWNER. >> REALLY?\n>> Caller: IN NOVEMBER 2014, YOU DISCUSSED TICKER PAY AND\nDISCUSSED HOW EVERY RETAILER WOULD NEED A NEW CREDIT CARD\nMACHINE. >> BUT THEN I PULLED IT WHEN IT\nTURNED OUT THEY COULDN'T MAKE ANY MONEY IN THE 20s, I SAID\nTHIS ONE WAS A BAD ONE, AND IT REMAINS A BAD ONE.\nTHEY JUST WEREN'T ALLOWED TO MAKE ANY MONEY IN THIS DARN\nTHING. WHAT CAN I SAY?\nAND THAT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IS THE CONCLUSION OF THE\nLIGHTNING ROUND!",

      "text": ">>> WE ARE ALWAYS ON THE LOOKOUT\nHERE ON \"MAD MONEY\" FOR PRIVATELY HELD COMPANIES THAT\nARE UPENDING THEIR RESPECTIVE INDUSTRIES EITHER WITH NEW\nPRACTICES OR INNOVATIVE PRACTICES.\nTHAT'S WHY WE GO OFF THE TAPE AND ON THE HUNT BECAUSE SOONER\nOR LATER THEY'RE GOING TO IMPACT THE COMPANIES YOU CAN INVEST IN.\nTAKE EARNEST, THE ONLINE LENDER THAT SPECIALIZES IN STUDENT LOAN\nREFINANCING AND PERSONAL LOANS FOR EVERYTHING FROM BUYING A\nHOME TO PAYING FOR A WEDDING RECEPTION.\nWITH EARNEST, THE WHOLE PROCESS OF BORROWING MONEY CAN BE DONE\nONLINE AND THEY'LL CHARGE YOU LOWER INTEREST RATES THAT\nCONVENTIONAL BANKS. EARNEST HAS A HYPERPERSONALIZED\nUNDERWRITING PROCESS WHERE THEY LEND YOU MONEY.\nTHEY LOOK AT A LOT MORE THAN JUST YOUR CREDIT SCORE, AND\nTHEY'RE PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE HELPS THEM FIGURE OUT WHETHER OR\nNOT YOU'RE A GOOD CREDIT RISK. THE COMPANY HAS BEEN AROUND FOR\nTHREE YEARS AND THEY JUST LAST MONTH CROSSED THE BILLION DOLLAR\nLOAN MARK. I THINK THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE\nOF HOW THE ONLINE LENDING SPACE IS DRAGGING THE FINANCIAL SECTOR\nKICKING AND SCREAMING INTO THE 21 CENTURY.\nLET'S SIT DOWN WITH THE CO-FOUNDER AND CEO OF EARNEST TO\nHERE MORE ABOUT HIS COMPANY AND WHAT SETS THEM APART FROM BOTH\nTRADITIONAL BANKS AND THE PLETHORA OF ONLINE LENDERS THAT\nHAVE POPPED UP IN RECENT YEARS. GOOD TO SEE YOU, SIR.\nHAVE A SEAT. >> HI, JIM.\n>> THANK YOU. WE'VE HAD A COUPLE OF THE ONLINE\nLENDERS ON, AND CANDIDLY THEY HAVEN'T DONE THAT WELL.\nI WOULD SAY THAT EITHER HAD TROUBLE FINDING INVESTORS TO BUY\nTHEIR LOANS, OR THEY WERE SLOPPY UNDERWRITERS.\nHOW DO WE DISTINGUISH THAT FROM YOU?\n>> YEAH. I THINK THAT THE FIRST PART IS\nWHAT YOU WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT, SLOPPY UNDERWRITING.\nAT EARNEST, WHAT WE'RE DOING IS THE MOST THOROUGH UNDERWRITING\nOF ANYBODY IN THE BUSINESS, OFFLINE, ONLINE.\nTHE WAY WE DO THAT IS WE'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THE FULL\nFINANCIAL PROFILE OF ALL THE INDIVIDUALS.\nSO WE'RE LOOKING AT THEIR BANK ACCOUNTS.\nWE'RE LOOKING AT THEIR PAST DEBTS, BUT WE'RE ALSO DIVING\nINTO THEIR ASSET ACCOUNTS, AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NO ONE\nELSE IS DOING. AND WE'RE DOING IT BY CONNECTING\nDIRECTLY TO THEIR ONLINE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS.\n>> NOW, I WOULD PRESUME THAT A JPMORGAN, WELLS FARGO, COULD DO\nTHIS IF THEY WANTED TO? >> YEAH, I MEAN I THINK THAT\nWHEN YOU TALK ABOUT COULD HAVE, WOULD HAVE, SHOULD HAVE, LOTS OF\nCOMPANIES COULD TRY TO DO WHAT OTHER MORE INNOVATIVE COMPANIES\nARE DOING, BUT I THINK ULTIMATELY WE'RE TOTALLY\nVERTICALLY INTEGRATED. AND WE RETHOUGHT FROM FIRST\nPRINCIPLES HOW WOULD YOU ASSESS SOMEONE?\nSO THIS HAPPENED TO ME. I WAS GOING TO GRADUATE SCHOOL.\nIT DIDN'T REALLY MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME THAT YOU WEREN'T LOOKING\nAT ALL MY PAST JOB HISTORY, AND YOU WEREN'T LOOKING AT ALL OF\nTHE SAVINGS I HAD RIGHT AT THAT MOMENT IN TIME.\nAND IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE TRADITIONAL SYSTEM, THE\nTRADITIONAL SYSTEM KIND OF HAD BUILT UP THIS RELIANCE ON CREDIT\nBUREAUS. >> RIGHT.\n>> AND CREDIT BUREAUS ARE JUST MISSING CASH FLOW AND --\n>> YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT LIKE A FICO SCORE.\n>> EXACTLY. >> AS FAR AS YOU'RE CONCERNED,\nTHAT'S ALMOST AN ABSTRACTION. >> IT'S A SUBSET.\nIF YOU THINK ABOUT A BALANCE SHEET LIKE, YOU KNOW, THE\nBALANCE SHEET OF ANY CONSUMER, YOU KNOW, THE CREDIT SCORE, THE\nFICO IS JUST A SUMMATION OF THE LINES ON SOMEONE'S CREDIT BUREAU\nREPORT, BUT IT'S GOT LAGGING DATA, AND IT'S TOTALLY MISSING\nTHE OTHER SIDE OF THE BALANCE SHEET, WHICH IS THE ASSET SIDE.\nTHEN IT'S TOTALLY MISSING THE INCOME STATEMENT.\n>> EXCELLENT. PEOPLE WHO HAVE USED YOU, HOW\nMUCH MONEY HAVE THEY SAVED? >> SO THE AVERAGE BORROWER SAVES\nJUST UNDER $22,000. SO FOR THE BILLION DOLLARS OF\nLOANS THAT WE'VE DONE JUST OVER, IT'S $300 MILLION IN AGGREGATE\nTHAT WE'VE SAVE THE OUR CLIENTS. >> AND HOW MUCH MONEY IS EARNEST\nABLE TO MAKE? SOME BANKS WOULD SAY, LOOK, THEY\nMUST BE NOT -- THEY'RE TAKING A RISK BY NOT MAKING ENOUGH.\nWE HAVE TO MAKE UP ENOUGH SO THAT WE DON'T -- IF WE LOSE,\nWE'RE STILL OKAY. >> YEAH.\nI MEAN SO WE CHARGE VERY LOW INTEREST RATE.\nOVERALL, OUR INTEREST RATES ARE ABOUT 5%.\n>> MM-HMM. >> BUT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE\nREALLY GOOD AT, ONE, REDUCING OUR COSTS USING SOFTWARE AND\nOUGHT MAKE AS WELL AS REALLY ASSESSING THE RISK.\nSO, YOU KNOW, OVER THE WHOLE LIFE OF THE BUSINESS FOR A\nBILLION DOLLARS OF OUR STUDENT LOAN REFINANCING, WE'VE NEVER\nHAD A LOAN DEFAULT OUTSIDE OF THE RESULT OF ONE OF OUR\nBORROWERS PASSING AWAY? >> NEVER?\n>> MM-HMM. >> NEVER?\n>> NONE OF OUR STUDENT LOANS. >> THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY.\nWOW. ABOUT WELLS FARGO, IS THAT AN\nOPPORTUNITY FOR YOU? DO YOU THINK PEOPLE SAY, YOU\nKNOW WHAT, IF THE SO-CALLED GREATEST BANKS IN THE WORLD ARE\nDOING THIS STUFF, I AM WILLING TO VENTURE OUT AND GO TO A BANK\nTHAT IS NEW THAT I TRUST MORE THAN THE OLD?\n>> YEAH. I MEAN I THINK FINANCIAL\nSERVICES IN THE WHOLE HISTORY OF FINANCIAL SERVICES IS BUILT ON\nTRUST. BUT I THINK -- AND EVEN IN MANY\nWAYS, FINANCIAL SERVICES HAS BEEN BUILT ON INNOVATION.\nBUT I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE LARGER INCUMBENTS\nLIKE THIS WELLS FARGO EXAMPLE, THIS KIND OF CHASE FOR REVENUE\nAND CHASE FOR EARNINGS, THEY HAVE SEEMED TO HAVE LOST THEIR\nWAY. THIS IS I THINK JUST ANOTHER\nEXAMPLE. BUT, YOU KNOW, WHEN WE STARTED\nTHIS COMPANY THREE YEARS AGO, WE KNEW THERE WAS A HUGE\nOPPORTUNITY TO REALLY START OVER FROM SCRATCH AND BUILD SOMETHING\nBETTER. >> LAST QUESTION.\nI FIND IT INTRIGUING. YOU KEEP THE LOAN.\n>> YEAH. >> SO IF I GET IN TROUBLE, I\nACTUALLY CAN TALK TO SOMEONE? >> EXACTLY.\nWE ORIGINATE ALL THE LOANS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET, AND WE DO USE\nTHE SECURITIZATION MARKET TO FINANCE OUR BALANCE SHEET.\nBUT THEN WE DO ALL OF THE LOAN SERVICING FOR THE LIFE OF THE\nLOAN. SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S ALSO\nUNIQUE. LIKE I SAID, WE'RE TOTALLY\nVERTICALLY INTEGRATED. WE HAVE A MOBILE APP.\nWE HAVE A WEB DASHBOARD, AND WE'VE INNOVATED A LOT OF\nFEATURES. ONE OF THE FEATURES ON THE\nSERVICING SIDE IS A SKIP A PAY FEATURE.\nIF YOU'RE IN GOOD STANDING AND YOU'D LIKE TO TAKE A MONTH OFF,\nYOU CAN JUST SKIP A PAY. WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING,\nGOLDMAN SACHS JUST LAUNCHED THE NEW MARCUS, AND THAT'S ONE OF\nTHE FEATURES OF OURS THAT THEY'VE EMULATED.\n>> EXCELLENT. ANYWAY, I THINK IT'S VERY\nCREATIVE AND A GREAT SOLUTION FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON. THAT'S LIEU AS BYRL CO-FOUNDER\nAND CEO OF EARNEST. THANK YOU.\n>> THANK YOU.",

      "text": "BECAUSE IT WASN'T AS BAD AS WE\nTHOUGHT. IN FACT, THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS\nIS SO BAD RIGHT NOW THAT WHEN PEOPLE -- THAT PEOPLE LOVED,\nLOVED, LOVED IT WHEN BUFFALO WILD WINGS PREDICTED ITS\nFRANCHISES WOULD HAVE MINUS 1.70 FRANCHISE SAME-STORE SALES,\nTHAT'S RIGHT, DOWN 1.7%. AND WHAT HAPPENED SOME IT KWAM\nIN AT MINUS 1.6%. THE FACT THAT IT WAS A NEGATIVE\nSALES NUMBER, THAT DIDN'T MATTER.\nTHE STOCK WENT UP OVER $8 TODAY OR 6%.\nIT'S ALMOST STUPEFYING, ISN'T IT?\nBUT THAT'S HOW BAD THIS INDUSTRY IS.\nIN THE LAND OF THE BLIND, THE ONE-EYED RESTAURANT CHAIN IS\nINDEED KING. TWITTER ALMOST PULLED THIS OFF\nTODAY. CAME VERY CLOSE.\nEMPHASIS OF COURSE IS ON ALMOST. THE STOCK WAS FLYING HIGH IN THE\nMORNING BECAUSE THE TRAJECTORY OF THEIR DAILY AVERAGE USERS WAS\nPOSITIVE. TWITTER WAS SUPPOSED TO REPORT A\nHORRENDOUS NUMBER. PART OF THAT WHOLE PROCESS BY\nWHICH THE COMPANY WAS UNABLE TO SELL ITSELF.\nAMID ALL OF THE OTHER RANCOR AND BAD WILL THAT DEVELOPED DURING A\nPROCESS THAT WAS PLAYED OUT WAY TOO PUBLICLY FOR MANY WAS THE\nBELIEF THAT WHEN TEERT NEXT REPORTED, IT WOULD DELIVER\nNUMBERS SO DISAPPOINTING THAT THE STOCK WOULD GO RIGHT BACK TO\nTHE $14 LEVEL, WHERE IT WAS BEFORE ALL THE TAKEOVER HOOPLA\nSTARTED. BUT TWITTER DIDN'T DO THAT.\nIT MANAGED TO REPORT THE KIND OF DISGUSTINGLY -- IT DID NOT THE\nDISGUSTINGLY TERRIBLE QUARTER THAT INVESTORS HAD ANTICIPATED.\nFOR A LITTLE WHILE IT LOOKED LIKE TWITTER'S STOCK WAS GOING\nTO BREAK OUT FOR GOOD. THEN WE LEARNED THE COMPANY WAS\nSHUTTING DOWN VINE. THAT WAS SOMETHING AT ONE POINT\nSPECULATORS THOUGHT WOULD BE THE REASON FOR SOMEONE TO ACQUIRE\nTWITTER. SO THE PRE-EARNINGS DESPERATION\nCAME BACK TO LIFE. IT DIDN'T HELP THEY TRIMMED\nTHEIR FORECAST EITHER. MY TAKE?\nLISTEN. IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM A\nLOT OF PEOPLE'S TODAY. YOU KNOW WHAT?\nI THINK GENUINELY IT WASN'T AS BAD AS I EXPECTED IT WOULD BE.\nTWITTER DID BEAT ON BOTH REVENUE AND EARNINGS.\nPLUS I THINK THIS NUMBER MAKES IT MORE LIKELY THAT TWITTER CAN\nCOME BACK INTO PLAY. THAT'S RIGHT.\nYOU HEARD ME. ESPECIALLY IF THEY DEVELOP\nSOMETHING THAT CAN USE MACHINE LEARNING TO ACTUALLY KNOCK OFF\nTHE TROLLS, WHICH I KEEP TELLING YOU IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE\nVALUATION. IF THEY DO THAT, I AM SAYING\nRIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW, THAT POTENTIAL ACQUIRERS WILL COME\nBACK, AND THIS COMPANY WILL BE BOUGHT BY SOMEONE ELSE WHO CAN\nUSE ALL THAT DATA TO HELP THEIR CLIENTS MAKE BETTER DECISIONS\nABOUT WHAT CONSUMERS WANT AND WHERE THEY'RE ADVERTISING\nDOLLARS COULD BE BEST SPENT. BUT, SEE, IT'S A ONE-TWO PUNCH.\nFIRST TWITTER HAS TO FIX THE TROLL PROBLEM, MAKING IT MORE OF\nA COMMUNITY THAT PEOPLE WANT TO GO TO OR NOT BE SCARED BY, AND I\nTHINK THEY COULD BE DOING THAT. THEN THEY HAVE TO KEEP THE\nPROCESS OF THE SALE QUIETER. IT GOT TOTALLY OUT OF HAND THE\nLAST TIME THE COMPANY PUT ITSELF UP FOR THE SALE OR WAS BEING\nSOLD, TO THE POINT WHERE IT BECAME $29 A BUS, FOR $29 A\nSHARE, THERE WAS NOBODY WILLING TO BUY THI THING, CORRECTLY\nSINCE THE ACQUIRER'S STOCK WOULD HAVE BEEN PUMMELED AT THAT PRICE\nTAG. I THINK THE DISCIPLINE OF\nCLOSING VINE AND CHOPPING HEADS, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME SHOWING\nSOME GROWTH, IS GOING TO MAKE TWITTER MORE ATTRACTIVE TO\nBUYERS. BUT, AGAIN, NOT UNTIL THE TROLL\nISSUE IS DEAD AND BURIED BECAUSE THE SHAREHOLDERS OF ANY\nPOTENTIAL SUITORS MIGHT DESPITE TWITTER FOR ITS INABILITY TO\nTAMP DOWN THE HATE EVEN AS THEY CAN'T KEEP THEIR EYES OFF IT TO\nSEE WHAT'S HAPPENING. BELIEVE ME, THEY CONTINUE TO FIX\nTHINGS UP, AND A GOOGLE OR A SALESFORCE WILL BE RIGHT BACK\nTHERE KICKING THE PROVERBIAL TIRES.\nFINALLY THERE ARE COMPANIES THAT RECOGNIZE THEY CAN CHANGE THE\nCOLORATION OF WHAT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THEM AND MANAGE TO MAKE\nTHEIR STOCKS SOAR. FOR YEARS QUALCOMM JUST KEPT\nDISAPPOINTING WALL STREET.  HOW THE HECK DOES A COMPANY LIKE\nTHAT MAKE WALL STREET SEE THAT IT ISN'T AS BAD AS THEY THINK IT\nIS? HOW ABOUT BY MAKING A BIG\nACQUISITION THAT CHANGES THE COMPANY'S STRIPES FROM A SO SO\nCELL PHONE CHIP PLAY INTO AN INTERNET OF THINGS UBL\nSEMICONDUCTOR COMPANY WITH SOME TERRIFIC CELL PHONE TECHNOLOGY\nON THE SIDE. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TODAY WHEN\nWE LEARNED QUALCOMM IS PLUNKING DOWN -- YOU CAN FOLLOW ALONG FOR\nAT ACTIONALERTSPLUS.COM. QUALCOMM STOCK ACTUALLY JUMPED\nMORE THAN NXPI'S. WHY?\nIT'S NOT AS BAD AS WE THOUGHT. IT'S GREAT TO BE BETTER THAN\nEXPECTED, BUT IN THIS MARKET, I'LL GLADLY TAKE NOT AS BAD AS\nWE THOUGHT. WHY BOTHER TO LOOK THROUGH IT?\nTHE DARN STRATEGY IS WORKING. PATRICK IN FLORIDA, PATRICK.\n>> Caller: HOW ARE, YOU JIM CRAMER?\n>> GOOD DAY FOR ME, PATRICK. HOW ABOUT YOU?\n>> Caller: EXCELLENT. THANKS FOR ASKING.\nJIM, A QUESTION FOR YOU. I'M LONG ON TESLA, AND WITH\nTHEIR RECENT EARNINGS REPORT AND SOLAR CITY ACTIVITY, I'M\nWONDERING WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ON THEIR GROWTH AND STOCK\nAPPRECIATION. >> PATRICK I THINK IF WE'RE NOT\nBUYING SOLAR CITY, I THINK THAT STOCK WOULD HAVE UP VERY BIG ON\nTHAT QUARTER EVEN THOUGH IT WAS AIDED BY SOME CREDITS.\nBUT BECAUSE THEY ARE BUYING SOLAR CITY, THE STOCK STALLED,\nAND THAT IS THE ISSUE IN MY EYES.\nI NEED TO GO TO CHARLES IN MISSOURI.\nCHARLES. >> Caller: HEY, JIM.\nI LIVE IN A SMALL TOWN IN THE BOOTHILL OF MISSOURI.\nWALMART JUST ANNOUNCED CLOSING OF OUR LOCAL STORE IN JANUARY OF\n2017. WE'VE HAD A STORE HERE FOR 40\nYEARS. IN LIGHT OF THE JET.COM PURCHASE\nBY WALMART, ARE SMALL STORES LIKE OURS SACRIFICIAL LAMBS, AND\nWHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE STOCK IN THE COMPANY'S FUTURE?\n>> WELL, CHARLES, IT IS TRUE THAT WALMART IS ACTUALLY CLOSING\nSOME STORES THEY THINK ARE UNDERPERFORMERS AND I THINK IT'S\nABOUT TIME. I FEEL BAD THEY CLOSED YOUR\nSTORE. THE JET.COM ACQUISITION IS VERY\nIMPORTANT. I CONTINUE TO SUPPORT EXACTLY\nWHAT DOUG McMILLAN IS DOING, AND HE IS ALWAYS WELCOME ON \"MAD\nMONEY.\" HOW ABOUT KEVIN IN TENNESSEE?\nKEVIN. >> Caller: MR. JIM.\nI HAVE OWNED TRACTOR SUPPLY FOR YEARS, AND IT'S PEREDTIL ITS RE.\nDO I BUY, SELL OR HOLD? >> OH, BOY.\nYOU KNOW, THAT WAS SUCH A BAD QUARTER, AND I KEPT THINKING\nWHEN THEY REPORTED THEIR ACTUAL NUMBER AFTER THEY FIRST SAID\nTHAT THINGS WOULD BE BAD, THAT IT WAS TIME TO PULL THE TRIGGER.\nBUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.\nNOW WE GOT TO WAIT FOR TAX LOSS SELLING BEFORE I CAN SAY IT IS\nTIME TO BUY TRACTOR SUPPLY. IT'S NOT OUTSTANDING.\nIT'S NOT EVEN GREAT. REALLY IT'S NOT EVEN GOOD, BUT\nIT IS NOT AS BAD AS WE THOUGHT. AND RIGHT NOW THAT'S ENOUGH FOR\nWALL STREET. ON \"MAD MONEY\" TONIGHT, IT'S\nHELPING ZILLOW, H&R BLOCK, AND KIMBERLY-CLARK CONNECT THEIR\nBUSINESSES. COULD IT HELP YOUR PORTFOLIO AS\nWELL? I'M SITTING DOWN WITH THE CEO OF\nSERVICE NOW. THEN THE NEGLECTED SECTORS ARE\nALIVE WITH THE SOUND OF PROFITS. I'LL TELL YOU WHICH ONES BEATEN\nDOWN ARE SUDDENLY SHOWING SIGNS OF LIFE.\nAND GROUPON CLOSED DOWN MORE THAN 20% TODAY BUT IT'S STILL UP\nOVER 30% FOR THE YEAR. IS THE DEAL OF THE DAY GOOD OR\nSHOULD IT BE AVOIDED? I'M TALKING WITH THE COMPANY'S\nCEO, SO STICK WITH CRAMER.",

THE COMPANY REPORTED A TWO CENT\nEARNINGS BEAT WITH IN LINE REVENUE UP 37% YEAR-OVER-YEAR.\nVERY BULLISH GUIDANCE FOR BOTH THE NEXT QUARTER AND THE FULL\nYEAR. MANAGEMENT TALKED ABOUT\nEXTREMELY VALUABLE NEW CLIENTS ON THE CONFERENCE CALL.\nYOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THE STOCK IS 7% HIGHER TODAY AND IT WAS\nEVEN HIGHER AT ONE POINT. LET'S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK WITH\nFRANK SLOOTMAN TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE QUARTER AND THE\nCOMPANY'S PROSPECTS. WELCOME BACK TO \"MAD MONEY.\"\n>> THANKS, JIM. IT'S GOING TO BE WITH YOU AGAIN.\n>> HOW CAN YOU ACCELERATE REVENUE GROWTH IN THIS\nENVIRONMENT? >> WELL, IT'S A FUNCTION OF US\nREALLY HITTING ON ALL CYLINDERS WHEN ALL OUR CHANNELS, ALL OUR\nGEOGRAPHIES, AND A LOT OF NEW PRODUCT SEGMENTS ARE ALL KICKING\nIN AT THE SAME TIME. YOU KNOW, YOU GO INTO OVERDRIVE\nAND YOU SORT OF SAW THE EFFECTS OF THAT.\n>> I SAW THERE WAS A CONTRACT IN FINANCE.\nI KNOW A LOT OF BANKS HAVE BEEN HOBBLED TOGETHER OVER TIME AND\nTHEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT KINDS OF -- ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF\nSYSTEMS ALL OVER THE PLACE. WAS THIS GIANT CONTRACT ONE OF\nTHOSE WHERE A BANK HAD MADE ACQUISITIONS OF OTHER BANKS AND\nTHEY REALLY FINALLY HAD TO GET IT TOGETHER?\n>> YES. TYPICALLY -- WELL, WHAT YOU SEE\nHERE IS THAT THESE VERY LARGE INSTITUTIONS ARE SITTING ON\nLARGE NUMBERS OF DISPARATE LEGACY SYSTEMS AND THEY'RE GOING\nTHROUGH A PROCESS WHERE THEY WANT TO MASSIVELY CONSOLIDATE\nAND STANDARDIZE ON A FRESH NEW PLATFORM.\n>> ALL RIGHT.  THE FIRST THING I SAY, WAIT A\nSECOND, WE HAVE A NEIL BUSH ON, AND WORK DAY IS SO GREAT AT HR,\nHOW CAN THEY BE GOING UP AGAINST SERVICENOW?\nYOU GUYS ARE ACTUALLY PARTNERS. CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW THAT\nPARTNERSHIP WORKS? >> YES.\nI MEAN WE'RE CUSTOMERS OF WORKDAY AS WELL, AND WORKDAY IS\nA CUSTOMER OF SERVICENOW, SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE A VERY GOOD VALUE\nADDED RELATIONSHIP. WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED ON\nPROCESSING THE WORK THAT COMES INTO HR ORGANIZATIONS, PEOPLE,\nEMPLOYEES AND LARGE COMPANIES HAVE A CONSTANT FLOW OF\nREQUESTS, ISSUES WITH PAYCHECKS AND SO ON.\nTHAT WORK FLOW IS RUN THROUGH SERVICENOW.\nSOMETIMES THAT RESULTS, INTERCHANGES INTO WORKDAY AS\nWELL IF IT'S A CHANGE OF ADDRESS OR A NEW MEMBER OF THE FAMILY,\nANYTHING THAT CHANGES THE ACTUAL RECORD, THAT GOES INTO WORKDAY.\nBUT WE TYPICALLY, OUR SYSTEMS ARE DEPLOYED ACROSS FUNCTIONAL\nBOUNDARIES. IN OTHER WORDS, WE'RE NOT JUST\nLAUNCHED TO SUPPORT HR. WE'RE ALSO LAUNCHED TO SUPPORT\nI.T. FACILITIES, LEGAL, AND MARKETS, AND LARGE ENTERPRISES\nWANT TO HAVE ONE SERVICE EXPERIENCE, NOT ONE UNIQUE TO\nEACH SERVICE AREA. >> BUT, FRANK, WOULD I KNOW THAT\nI'M INPUTTING A QUESTION TO SERVICENOW, OR WOULD I THINK I'M\nJUST INPUTTING A QUESTION TO THE COMPANY?\n>> THAT'S EXACTLY THE POINT. YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW\nWHO YOU'RE TALKING TO. >> INTERESTING.\nOKAY. NOW, YOU WANT A PIECE OF\nBUSINESS WITH A COMPANY THAT WE HAVE LONG FAVORED FOR ABOUT 140\nPOINTS, CONSTELLATION BRANDS. I KNOW IT'S A NEW PIECE OF\nBUSINESS SO WE DON'T HAVE TO GET INTO WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH THEM\nRIGHT NOW. BUT WHY WOULD THEY BE ATTRACTED\nTO SERVICENOW, AND WHO ELSE WOULD THEY BE THINKING OF DOING?\nWHY DO YOU WIN THAT BUSINESS? HOW COME YOU GET THAT CONTRACT?\n>> WELL, WE WIN FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS.\nBUT, YOU KNOW, TYPICALLY THERE'S A BIG MODERNIZATION EFFORT UNDER\nWAY WHERE, YOU KNOW, COMPANIES ARE TRYING TO CONSOLIDATE AND\nREFRESH IN TERMS OF ARCHITECTURE, IN TERMS OF\nPLATFORM, AND SET OURSELVES UP FOR 10, 15, 20 YEARS TO REALLY\nHAVE A PLATFORM THAT THEY CAN BUILD ON OVER THAT PERIOD OF\nTIME. AT THE SAME TIME, THEY'RE\nLOOKING FOR TRANSFORMATIONS. THEY WANT TO CHANGE THE SERVICE\nEXPERIENCE THAT THEY HISTORICALLY HAVE HAD, SOMETHING\nTHAT IS MUCH CLOSER TO THE CONSUMER EXPERIENCE THAT YOU GET\nIN ONLINE RETAILING, ONLINE BANKING, AND SO ON.\nAND THEN FINALLY, WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT REDEFINING THE\nECONOMICS, THE COST STRUCTURES. ORGANIZATIONS ARE ALWAYS LOOKING\nTO TAKE OUT BIG CHUNKS OF COST, AND THAT'S VERY MUCH CENTRAL TO\nTHE BIG INITIATIVES THAT WE DO WITH THESE COMPANIES.\n>> BUT YOU ALSO DEAL WITH COMPANIES TAKE LIKE A ZILLOW.\nWHEN IT WAS A SMALLER COMPANY, YOU PROBABLY DID A LOT OF THINGS\nON PAPER. WHEN IT'S MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE\nLOGGING IN EVERY SINGLE DAY, IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY.\nSO THEY WOULD BRING IN A SERVICENOW TO BE ABLE TO MAKE\nSURE THEY SEE CORRECT PATTERNS, KNOW IF THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG\nWITHIN THEIR ORGANIZATION? >> WELL, FIRST AND FOREMOST, WE\nGOT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ZILLOW INFRASTRUCTURE IS ALWAYS IN THE\nAIR AND AVAILABLE FOR THEIR END USER CLIENTELE.\nSO WE PLAY A VERY CRITICAL ROLE TO MAKING SURE THAT ZILLOW'S\nSERVICE EXPERIENCE IS AVAILABLE AND PERFORMS AND SO ON.\n>> ALL RIGHT. LAST QUESTION.\nDID YOU CHUCKLE WHEN YOU SAW THE E-MAIL THAT WAS RELEASED FROM\nCOLIN POWELL -- THEY ACTUALLY CRACKED HIS E-MAIL BOX -- WHICH\nSAID THAT YOU WERE A TARGET OF SALESFORCE?\nI KNOW THAT YOU AND MARK ARE FRIENDS, AND I DON'T THINK THERE\nWAS REALLY ANYTHING GOING ON AT ALL.\n>> YEAH, I DON'T THINK THAT MANY PEOPLE REALIZE, BUT, YOU KNOW,\nCEOs TALK. NOT JUST CEOs TALK, BUT\nEVERYBODY TALKS IN SILICON VALLEY.\nYOU KNOW, IT'S NOT ALWAYS ABOUT M&A.\nWE COMPARE NOTES ON MANY THINGS. IT'S VERY INFORMAL.\nALL COMPANIES MAINTAIN LISTS OF ASSETS THEY'RE INTERESTED IN.\nIT'S NOT QUITE AS EVENTFUL AS I THINK THE INDUSTRY OBSERVERS ARE\nMAKING IT OUT TO BE. >> ALL RIGHT.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH AND CONGRATULATIONS ON A GREAT\nQUARTER. FRANK SLOOTMAN, PRESIDENT AND\nCEO OF SERVICENOW. STAY WITH CRAMER.",

RE-RATING SOME VERY BIG SECTORS,\nMEANING INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS ARE PUSHING MONEY INTO GROUPS\nTHAT HAVE BEEN STALLED OUT OR NEGLECTED FOR AGES.\nTHEY SUDDENLY COME ALIVE BECAUSE SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO MAKE\nTHEM MORE VALUABLE THAN THEY WERE JUST A COUPLE QUARTERS AGO.\nTAKE THE BANKS. THE BANKS MAKE UP A HUGE\nPERCENTAGE OF THE S&P 500, BUT THEIR PERFORMANCE HAS LAGGED\nBEHIND THE AVERAGES FOR AGES AND AGES.\nTHAT'S BECAUSE THE BANKS HAVE BEEN STUCK IN INTEREST RATE AND\nREGULATORY HELL. THE FINANCIALS SIMPLY CAN'T MAKE\nTHAT MUCH MONEY OFF YOUR DEPOSITS BECAUSE RATES ARE SO\nLOW. LATELY, THOUGH, INVESTORS HAVE\nBEEN PINNING THEIR HOPES ON A POTENTIAL RATE HIKE, WHICH WILL\nLET THE BANKS GENERATE HIGHER PROFITS PRETTY MUCH RISK-FREE.\nBUT THIS TIME RIGHT NOW, IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS, BUYERS ARE\nGOBBLING THESE BANK STOCKS UP NOT BECAUSE OF A RATE HIKE BUT\nBECAUSE OF FEES. YEP, THE FOCUS IS ON FEES, FEES,\nAND MORE FEES. MAYBE ENOUGH FEES TO MAKE PEOPLE\nWANT TO OWN FINANCIALS FOR MORE THAN JUST THE NET INTEREST\nMARGIN. THAT HAS BEEN THE ONLY THING\nANYONE HAS CARED ABOUT FOR THREE YEARS.\nWHERE ARE THE BANKS MAKING THIS MONEY?\nWHEN YOU SEE GIANT IPOs LIKE ZTO EXPRESS, FORGET THE FACT THAT IT\nDIDN'T DO WELL, WE HAVE TO TAKE NOTICE OF WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE\nBANKS. THEY'RE MAKING MONEY ON THAT,\nESPECIALLY IT SOUNDS LIKE A SNAPCHAT IPO MIGHT NOT BE THAT\nFAR AWAY, AND THAT IS GOING TO COIN MONEY FOR THE BANKS.\nINITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS ARE VERY LUCRATIVE BUSINESS BUT\nTHERE YEAR THERE HAVEN'T BEEN VERY MANY AND IT'S HURT THE\nEQUITY SALES TRADING. THAT SEEMS TO BE CHANGING THIS\nQUARTER. RE-RATING.\nMEANWHILE WE'VE GOT MERGERS GALORE, ANOTHER TERRIFIC\nBUSINESS FOR THE INVESTMENT BANKS.\nWHEN YOU SEE QUALCOMM'S $47 BILLION PURCHASE OF NXP\nSEMICONDUCTORS, A TRANSACTION THAT'S DRIVEN THE ACQUIRER'S\nSTOCK UP DRAMATICALLY, THAT'S RIGHT, QUALCOMM, YOU CAN ALMOST\nTASTE THE BIG M&A FEES ESPECIALLY SINCE IT COMES ON THE\nHEELS OF THE AT&T AND TIME WARNER TIEUP.\nWHEN YOU SEE THE WILD TRADING IN CURRENCIES THAT WE'VE\nEXPERIENCED LATELY, COUPLED WITH ALL THAT BOND ACTIVITY, YOU GOT\nTO START THINKING MAYBE THE BREXIT INDUCED TURMOIL THAT\nPRODUCED SUCH RICH TRADING FEES MIGHT NOT BE ONE TIME ONLY.\nAND WHEN YOU SEE THE LONG GROWTH THAT WE'RE GETTING AT BOTH LARGE\nBANKS LIKE BANK OF AMERICA AND JPMORGAN, YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE\nTHAT THEIR GROSS MARGINS COULD FINALLY BE CLIMBING JUST FROM\nLENDING ALONE. HOW BIG COULD THE RIPPLES BE?\nI'LL GO OUT ON A LIMB HERE AND SAY IF THE FEDERAL RESERVE\nRAISES RATES IN DECEMBER, GET THIS, THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.\nTHE MOST BELEAGUERED COMPANY IN THE UNIVERSE RIGHT NOW, YOU CAN\nFILL IN THE BLANK, YES, TALKING WELLS FARGO, MIGHT EVEN SEE ITS\nSTOCK GO HIGHER. NOW, THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING.\nIN THE MEANTIME, CITIGROUP REMAINS THE CHEAPEST OF THE\nBANKS ON A BOOK VALUE. I THINK IT CAN VAULT $15 FROM HERE.\nLOOK, IT'S NOT JUST THE BANKS. WE'RE SEEING A SIMILAR RE-RATING\nOF THE OIL SERVICE STOCKS. ONCE CRUDE GOT TO 50, DOMESTIC\nDRILLING STARTED PICKING UP. THE BIG DOGS THAT PROVIDE\nASSISTANCE TO THE OIL PRODUCERS, WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE SCOOP IN\nOKLAHOMA, ARE SEEING A REAL REVIVAL.\nTHAT'S HOW THE STOCK OF HALLIBURTON AND BAKER HUGHES\nHAVE BEEN -- FINALLY THE AIRLINE STOCKS ARE BACK IN BUSINESS.\nI SAY THAT BECAUSE WHEN SOUTHWEST SAYS THAT THINGS ARE\nPRETTY DOWN BEAT ABOUT THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT AND THEN\nMANY OF THE OTHER STOCKS IN THE COHORT ARE EITHER HIT WITH\nMERELY GLANCING BLOWS OR ACTUALLY GO HIGHER ON THE SAME\nDAY OF A SOUTHWEST MORNING, WELL, THAT'S JUST A PLANE OF A\nDIFFERENT COLOR. THE MUCH IMPROVED UNITED\nCONTINENTAL REMAINS MY FAVORITE IN THAT SECTOR.\nHERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE. THE BANKS, THE OIL SERVICE\nCOMPANIES, AND THE AIRLINES, AIR ALL GROUPS THAT THE MARKET HAD\nGIVEN UP ON FOR AT LEAST THE LAST YEAR, MAYBE LONGER.\nAND THEY'RE ALL INCHING BACK. I THINK ALL PRIME TO EXPLODE\nHIGHER IF JUST A FEW MORE THINGS GO WELL BECAUSE THE FABLED\nRE-RATING PROCESS HAS THIS  P.T. IN CALIFORNIA.\nP.T. >> Caller: JIM, HOW YOU DOING.\nGREETINGS FROM YOUR SECOND BIGGEST FAN IN THE WORLD?\n>> THANK YOU. WHAT'S HAPPENING?\n>> Caller: NOT MUCH. I RAN INTO A 3-YEAR-OLD ON THE\nSTREET THAT HAD A \"MAD MONEY\" BINKY.\n>> THAT'S GOOD NEWS. >> Caller: SO, HEY, I WAS\nLISTENING TO EXCHANGES MY GOLDMAN SACHS, AND THEY'RE\nROLLING OUT A PRETTY COOL RETAIL BANK ONLINE, DEPOSITS FOR AS\nLITTLE AS A DOLLAR AND SOME REALLY ATTRACTIVE AND AGGRESSIVE\nPERSONAL LINES OF CREDIT FROM 3 TO LIKE $33,000.\nI'M WONDERING WITH THE TROUBLE AT WELLS FARGO ARE THESE\nINNOVATIONS AT GOLDMAN SACHS A GOOD TIME TO GET BULLISH?\n>> I THINK YOU SHOULD BE BULLISH BECAUSE THEY'RE A CORE BUSINESS\nOF INVESTMENT BANKS AND TRADING ARE DOING QUITE WELL.\nI LIKED THE QUARTER VERY WELL. MARCUS WHICH IS THE NAME OF THAT\nONLINE BANK, IT'S NOT GOING TO MOVE THE NEEDLE.\nWHAT WILL MOVE THE NEEDLE ARE THESE BIG FEES.\nI THINK GOLDMAN SACHS IS TOO CHEAP A STOCK.\nJAY IN INDIANA, JAY. >> Caller: HEY, JIM.\nTHANKS FOR YOUR TIME. I HAVE A TWO-PART QUESTION, AND\nIT'S ABOUT PHARMACEUTICALS. BILL MILLER EARLIER THIS WEEK\nSAID HE SEES YOU'RE EXDOUBLE IN THREE YEARS.\nWHAT IS YOUR VIEW ON IT? DO YOU THINK THEY SHOULD SELL A\nBOUSH AND LOAM IF THERE'S A POTENTIAL BUYER?\n>> I WAS GOING TO SAY I DON'T KNOW IF THERE ARE ANY BUYERS OUT\nTHERE FOR BOUSH AND LAUM. THAT MEANS THAT ASSET MAY NOT BE\nABLE TO COMMAND AS MUCH MONEY, WHICH MAKES ME WORRY ABOUT THE\nBALANCE SHEET, AND I AM ON THE SAME SIDE AS BILL MILLER IN A\nLOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS, PARTICULARLY THE AIRLINES, BUT\nNOT WHEN IT COMES TO VALIANT. >> DON'T BUY.\nDON'T BUY. >> BRUCE IN FLORIDA, BRUCE.\n>> Caller: HI, JIM. I WAS REALLY KIND OF WONDERING\nIF YOU CAN MAYBE ANSWER THIS QUESTION FOR ME.\nWHY IS CHEVRON TRADING SO MUCH HIGHER THAN EXXON MOBIL, CONOCO\nPHILLIPS AND B.P.? >> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.\nI THINK WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE EXXON IS TRADING HIGHER.\nTHESE COMPANIES ARE DUE TO REPORT.\nCHEVRON IS REGARDED AS BEING THE MOST AGGRESSIVE AND FRANKLY IN\nMANY WAYS THE MOST SCIENTIFIC OF ALL OF THE DIFFERENT OIL\nCOMPANIES. BUT EXXON AND CHEVRON ARE UP THE\nSAME AMOUNT. IF YOU ASK ME, I ALWAYS LIKE THE\nCHEVRON GUYS. I THINK THEY OFFER A LOT --\nBRING A LOT TO THE TABLE. BUT MY CHARITABLE TRUST OWNS\nOCCIDENTAL. BETTER YIELD RIGHT NOW, A LITTLE\nBIT BIGGER THAN THESE GUYS, AND I THINK HAS MORE OF AN\nOPPORTUNITY TO BRING OUT VALUE. SO I THINK IF YOU WANT TO BE IN\nTHE PATCH, GO OCCIDENTAL. A LITTLE LESS YIELD THAN\nCHEVRON. LITTLE MORE YIELD THAN EXXON,\nBUT A LOT MORE OPPORTUNITY. ANYWAY, BANKS, ENERGY, AND\nAIRLINES, THREE AREAS OF THE MARKET THAT COULD BE READY FOR A\nSUSTAINED RALLY AFTER BEING OUT IN THE COLD.\nI PRRTLY LIKE THE OIL SERVICE COMPANIES.\n67 MORE AHEAD ON \"MAD MONEY.\" I'M TALKING WITH GROUPON'S CEO\nAFTER A VERY ROUGH EARNINGS REPORT TO SEE ABOUT THE\nE-COMMERCE. THEN WITH STUDENT LOAN DAET AT\n$1.3 TRILLION, I'M TALKING TO ONE PRIVATE COMPANY THAT THINKS\nIT CAN HELP.

SUNLAND, TRUMP HAS A NARROW PATH\nTO 270 ELECTORAL VOTES, BUT A WIN IN OHIO COULD CERTAINLY MAKE\nA DIFFERENCE. >> Reporter: OHIO IS MUST-WIN\nFOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, WHICH IS WHY WE'RE SEEING THEM MAKE SUCH\nA BIG PUSH HERE IN OHIO, THREE STATES FOR DONALD TRUMP TODAY\nALONE. CAMPAIGN ADVISERS ADMIT THEIR\nPATH TO 270 IS, IN THEIR WORDS, AN UPHILL CLIMB.\nBUT THEY'RE LOOKING AT THESE RECENT STATE POLLS, INCLUDING\nHERE IN OHIO. OHIO WHICH SHOWED THAT THE RACE\nIS TIGHTENING. SO THEY ARE SEEING THAT THEY ARE\nNOW IN A BETTER POSITION THAN THEY WERE JUST A WEEK AGO.\nDONALD TRUMP BLANKETING THE BATTLEGROUND STATE OF OHIO\nTODAY. >> IN 12 DAYS, WE'RE GOING TO\nWIN OHIO AND WE ARE GOING TO WIN BACK THE WHITE HOUSE.\n>> Reporter: THE STATE AND ITS 18 ELECTORAL VOTES CRITICAL TO\nTRUMP. >> HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO\nDOUBLE DOWN ON OBAMACARE. >> Reporter: WITH LESS THAN TWO\nWEEKS LEFT, TRUMP IS SEIZING ON THE STEADY DRIP OF HACKED\nE-MAILS COMING FROM WIKILEAKS. >> IF THE CLINTONS WERE WILLING\nTO PLAY THIS FAST AND LOOSE WITH THEIR ENTERPRISE, WHEN THEY\nWEREN'T IN THE WHITE HOUSE, JUST IMAGINE WHAT THEY'LL DO GIVEN\nTHE CHANCE TO ONCE AGAIN CONTROL THE OVAL OFFICE.\n>> Reporter: EVEN AS HE BACKS OFF HIS RECENT THREAT TO SUE THE\nWOMEN WHO HAVE ACCUSED HIM OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT.\n>> ALL OF THESE LIARS WILL BE SUED AFTER THE ELECTION IS OVER.\n>> Reporter: NO LONGER SAYING HE'LL GO THROUGH WITH IT.\n>> WE'LL FIND OUT. LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE\nELECTION. >> Reporter: TRUMP REVEALING\nTODAY, HIS CAMPAIGN IS PLANNING TO DEPLOY HIS WIFE MELANIA FOR A\nSERIES OF CLOSING SPEECHES. >> SHE'S GOING TO DO TWO OR\nTHREE SPEECHES. I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE BIG\nSPEECHES, IMPORTANT SPEECHES. >> Reporter: MELANIA HAS BEEN\nABSENT FROM THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL SINCE HER CAMPAIGN SPEECH IN\nJULY. BUT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS\nLEANING ON HER VOICE TO HELP IMPROVE HER HUSBAND'S STANDING\nWITH WOMEN. >> I SUPPORT HIM 100% AND I'M\nTHERE FOR HIM EVERY TIME HE NEEDS ME.\nAND I'M GOING TO JOIN HIM. >> Reporter: MEANTIME, TRUMP IS\nRECLAIMING SOME SUPPORT IN THE NEW TOSS-UP STATE OF UTAH FROM\nCONGRESSMAN JASON CHAFFETZ. HE WITHDREW HIS SUPPORT AFTER\nTRUMP'S COMMENTS ABOUT WOMEN WERE REVEALED IN THE 2005\nAUDIOTAPE. >> I'M OUT.\nI CAN NO LONGER ENDORSE DONALD TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT.\nWE'VE GOT A 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER.\nDO YOU THINK I CAN LOOK HER IN THE EYE AND TELL HER THAT I\nENDORSED DONALD TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT WHEN HE ACTS LIKE THIS\nAND HIS APOLOGY? >> Reporter: WITBUT NOW, AFTER\nNEARLY A DOZEN WOMEN HAVE COME FORWARD, HE SAYS, I WILL NOT\nDEFEND OR ENDORSE DONALD TRUMP, BUT I AM VOTING FOR HIM.\nHRC IS THAT BAD. SOME REPUBLICANS, INCLUDING\nCHAFFETZ, ARE CONSIDERING THE PROSPECTS OF A CLINTON\nADMINISTRATION. THE CHAIR OF THE OVERSIGHT\nCOMMITTEE PROMISING YEARS OF CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATIONS,\nSAYING \"EVEN BEFORE WE GET TO DAY ONE, WE'VE GOT TWO YEARS\nWORTH OF MATERIAL ALREADY LINED UP.\"\nAND SENATOR TED CRUZ WARNING REPUBLICANS MIGHT NOT VOTE ON\nTHE NOMINATION FOR THE SUPREME COURT SEAT VACATED BY THE DEATH\nOF JUSTICE SCALIA. >> THERE'S CERTAINLY LONG\nHISTORICAL PRECEDENT WITH A SUPREME COURT WITH FEWER\nJUSTICES. >> Reporter: AND IN THAT\nINTERVIEW WHERE DONALD TRUMP REVEALED THAT MELANIA WOULD BE\nMAKING TWO OR THREE SPEECHES IN THE FINAL STRETCH FOR HIM,\nMELANIA SEEMED A BIT OFF GUARD BY THAT.\nSHE SEEMED SURPRISED BY THAT SUGGESTION.\nAND IN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, THEY HAVE NOT GOTTEN BACK ON\nSPECIFICS WHERE AND WHEN THOSE BIG SPEECHES WOULD BE GIVEN IN\nTHIS FINAL STRETCH. >> WE'LL BE ANXIOUS TO COVER\nTHOSE SPEECHES. SUNLEN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nWE'RE JOINED NOW BY CONGRESSMAN SHAWN DUFFY.\nTHANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US.\n>> GOOD TO BE BACK WITH YOU, WOLF.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THESE NEW POLLS THAT CAME OUT TODAY\nSHOWING DONALD TRUMP LOSING HIS LEAD, GET THIS, IN STATES HE HAD\nBEEN DOING VERY WELL IN. IN GEORGIA, FOR EXAMPLE, RIGHT\nNOW HE'S ONLY BEHIND BY -- SHE'S ONLY BEHIND BY ONE POINT, 44%\nFOR TRUMP, 43% FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nLOOK AT IOWA RIGHT NOW. IN IOWA, HE HAD BEEN DOING\nREALLY WELL, 44%, 44%. A MONTH AGO, TRUMP WAS UP BY\nSEVEN POINTS. WHY IS HE SLIPPING?\n>> WELL, FIRST OFF, I THINK GEORGIA IS NOT GOING TO BE A\nPROBLEM FOR DONALD TRUMP. THAT'S A REPUBLICAN STATE.\nAS VOTERS GO TO THE POLLS, THEY'LL BREAK DONALD TRUMP'S\nWAY. WE'LL WIN GEORGIA.\nBUT OBVIOUSLY SOME OF THE TROUBLE THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS\nHAD OVER THE LAST MONTH HAS CAUSED HIM TO SLIP NOT JUST IN\nIOWA BUT ALL THESE STATES AND THE NATIONAL POLLS ACROSS THE\nCOUNTRY. WHAT'S INTERESTING, WOLF, HE'S\nCOME BACK IN DRAMATIC FASHION. IN FLORIDA, NORTH CAROLINA, IN\nIOWA, OHIO, NEVADA, AND I'LL TELL YOU, WISCONSIN IS DOING\nINCREDIBLY WELL FOR MR. TRUMP. SO HE HAS THIS INSIDE TRACK.\nHE HAS TO HIT EVERYTHING RIGHT. BUT IF HE DOES, HE'S WITHIN\nSTRIKING DISTANCE IN THESE SWING STATES, AND HE COULD PULL THIS\nVICTORY OUT. >> WE CHECKED, CONGRESSMAN, IN\nYOUR HOME STATE OF WISCONSIN. THE LAST POLL THAT WE HAVE, A\nSCIENTIFIC POLL, HILLARY CLINTON IN WISCONSIN WAS UP BY SEVEN\nPOINTS IN WISCONSIN. SO DO YOU THINK HE REALLY HAS A\nCHANCE OF CAPTURING WISCONSIN? >> I DO.\nSO IN WISCONSIN, THIS WAS THE HOME OF THE SCOTT WALKER\nRECALLS, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN WISCONSIN IS THE BEST REPUBLICAN\nPARTY IN THE COUNTRY. WE ARE TURNING OUT ALMOST AS\nMANY DOOR KNOCKS AS FLORIDA AND OHIO.\nSO OUR BASE IS ACTIVATED. WE STILL HAVE A LITTLE PROBLEM\nIN SOUTHEAST WISCONSIN WITH REPUBLICANS.\nBUT AS THOSE REPUBLICANS COME HOME, WITH ALL THE WORK WE'VE\nDONE ACROSS THE STATE, THIS WILL BE A NAIL BITER.\nI THINK WISCONSIN WILL GO TO TRUMP IN THE END.\n>> EVERY POLL WE'VE SEEN, HILLARY CLINTON IN WISCONSIN IS\nUP SEVEN OR EIGHT POINTS. IS TRUMP, HAS HE BEEN THERE\nLATELY, IS HE PLANNING ON GOING IN THE LAST 12 DAYS?\n>> I'VE SEEN INTERNAL POLLS, AS WELL.\nWE TRY TO GET THE BEST AND MOST ACCURATE DATA POSSIBLE SO WE CAN\nFUNCTION WITH GOOD DATA. IT'S FAR CLOSER THAN THE RECENT\nPOLL THAT YOU CITE. SO MR. TRUMP WAS HERE A LITTLE\nOVER A WEEK AGO. I'M HOPEFUL, AND THERE'S BEEN\nRUMBLINGS THAT HE MIGHT COME BACK THIS WEEKEND OR EARLY NEXT\nWEEK. BUT HE KNOWS THAT OUTSIDE OF,\nAGAIN, FLORIDA, NORTH CAROLINA, IOWA, OHIO, NEVADA, HE NEEDS\nANOTHER STATE. AND IF IT'S NOT PENNSYLVANIA,\nAND I THINK PENNSYLVANIA IS GETTING REALLY TOUGH TO GRAB FOR\nHIM, I THINK WISCONSIN IS THE NEXT BEST PLAY.\nAGAIN, A GREAT GROUND GAME, AN ACTIVISTED REPUBLICAN BASE, AND\nTHE INTERNAL POLLS ARE MUCH CLOSER.\n>> HOW MUCH OF A PROBLEM IN WISCONSIN -- PAUL RYAN IS, OF\nCOURSE, FROM WISCONSIN, HE'S DOING NOTHING -- HE'S NOT\nCAMPAIGNING OUT THERE IN WISCONSIN OR ANY PLACE ELSE FOR\nDONALD TRUMP, IS HE? >> WHAT HE'S DONE IS, HE'S\nFUNDED THE WHOLE WISCONSIN GOP OPERATION.\n>> BUT HE'S TRYING TO GET REPUBLICANS ELECTED IN\nWISCONSIN, BUT I DON'T SEE HIM ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL WITH\nDONALD TRUMP OR EVEN SPEAKING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP FOR THAT\nMATTER. >> WE HAVE TO BE FRANK.\nWE HAVE FAR MORE HOUSE SEATS THAT ARE IN PLAY TODAY THAN SIX\nWEEKS AGO. SO MR. RYAN IS OUT THERE TALKING\nABOUT THE REPUBLICAN MESSAGE, THE REPUBLICAN VISION, AND ALSO\nRAISING MONEY TO MAKE SURE WE CAN PUSH BACK AGAINST AN\nONSLAUGHT OF DEMOCRAT CASH THAT'S RAINING HELL FIRE ON US.\nTHEY HAVE WAY MORE MONEY THAN WE DO.\nSO MR. RYAN IS MAKING SURE WE HAVE THE RESOURCES TO FIGHT\nBACK. THAT'S A FULL-TIME JOB.\nHE'S WORKING ON KEEPING THE HOUSE.\nDONALD TRUMP IS WORKING ON WINNING THE PRESIDENCY.\nTHOSE ARE TWO DIFFERENT JOBS THAT TAKE TWO DIFFERENT ROLES.\n>> THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE, PAUL RYAN IN WISCONSIN, HE'S\nVERY POPULAR IN YOUR HOME STATE. IF HE WERE OUT THERE SPEAKING\nPUBLICLY, NOT ONLY TRYING TO GET REPUBLICANS ELECTED IN THE HOUSE\nAND THE SENATE, GOVERNOR'S RACES OR WHATEVER, IF HE WERE OUT\nTHERE REALLY ACTIVELY PROMOTING DONALD TRUMP, THAT COULD MAKE A\nDIFFERENCE. >> IT COULD, BUT I DON'T WANT TO\nSPEAK FOR PAUL. I HAVEN'T HAD THIS CONVERSATION\nWITH HIM, SO I'M GOING TO SURMISE HERE, BUT THERE'S A LOT\nOF REPUBLICANS, THEY MIGHT BE DOWN IN THEIR DISTRICTS -- OR\nMR. TRUMP MIGHT BE DOWN IN THEIR DISTRICTS BY 15 OR 20 POINTS.\nSO THEY HAVE TO OUTPERFORM HIM BY BIG NUMBERS.\nPAUL IS NOT JUST LOOKING AT WISCONSIN, AND HOW WISCONSIN\nPLAYS FOR MR. TRUMP, HE'S LOOKING AT OUR NATIONAL PLAYING\nFIELD AND HOW HE HAS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COME BACK AND WE\nDON'T HAVE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI. DONALD TRUMP IS DOING JUST FINE\nHERE HIMSELF. AND LISTEN, DO I SUSPECT THAT\nMR. RYAN IS GOING TO VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP?\nI SUSPECT SO. WE'LL SEE.\n>> DONALD TRUMP TWEETED THIS TODAY, I'LL PUT IT UP ON THE\nSCREEN, HE TWEETED THIS, HE SAID A LOT OF CALL-INS ABOUT VOTE\nFLIPPING AT THE VOTING BOOTHS IN TEXAS.\nPEOPLE ARE NOT HAPPY. BIG LINES.\nWHAT IS GOING ON? ELECTION OFFICIALS SAY THAT\nTHEY'VE HAD SOME HUMAN ERROR BASICALLY IN SOME OF THE\nTABLETS, THEY'VE GOT ELECTRONIC VOTING THERE.\nBUT THEY DON'T THINK IT'S A BIG PROBLEM.\nIS HE RAISING THIS PROBLEM TO SUGGEST THAT THE ENTIRE ELECTION\nSYSTEM, AS HE KEEPS SAYING, IS RIGGED?\n>> FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, I'VE HEARD THE SAME STORIES ABOUT THE\nVOTING MACHINES SWITCHING VOTES. WE KNOW THAT DEAD PEOPLE ACROSS\nAMERICA ARE STILL VOTING MIRACULOUSLY.\nAND WE KNOW THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE VOTING TWICE.\nDO I THINK THAT'S SO WIDESPREAD THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE THE\nELECTION AWAY FROM HILLARY CLINTON OR FROM DONALD TRUMP?\nI DON'T THINK THAT'S THE CASE. BUT ON THESE ELECTRONIC VOTING\nMACHINES, I DON'T LIKE THEM. THIS IS WHAT WE DO IN MY\nDISTRICT HERE IN WISCONSIN. YOU FILL OUT YOUR PAPER BALLOT\nAND YOU PUT IT THROUGH THE ELECTRONIC READER, BUT YOU CAN\nGO BACK AND LOOK AT THE PAPER BALLOTS.\nIF SOMEONE HAS MESSED WITH THE PROGRAMMING, THAT CAN TWEAK THE\nRESULTS OF A RACE. I DON'T HAVE ANY EVIDENCE OR\nINFORMATION THAT THERE'S ANY WIDESPREAD PROBLEMS ACROSS THE\nCOUNTRY. BUT IT'S INCUMBENT UPON US AS\nAMERICANS AND ELECTED AMERICAN OFFICIALS WE TRY TO GET THE BEST\nRESULT POSSIBLE, WHICH IS CLEAR THE DEAD FOLKS OUT.\nMAKE SURE THERE'S SWIFT PENALTIES FOR THOSE THAT VIOLATE\nTHE LAW AND VOTE MORE THAN ONCE. AND IF YOU ARE USING AN\nELECTRONIC VOTING SYSTEM, THAT IT IS FUNCTIONING AND WILL\nACCURATELY REFLECT THE VOTES OF THE PEOPLE THAT CAST A BALLOT.\n>> THE TEXAS AUTHORITIES SAY THE ELECTRONIC VOTING MACHINE IS\nWORKING FINE, BUT SOME PEOPLE ARE MAKING HUMAN ERROR, THEY'RE\nNOT NECESSARILY FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS, BUT IT'S NOT BIG,\nTHEY SAY. THERE'S BEEN A FEW PROBLEMS LIKE\nTHAT. BUT THEY'RE NOT SUGGESTING IT'S\nA BIG PROBLEM. >> ONE OTHER POINT ON THAT,\nTHESE ARE ARTICLES THAT I'VE READ, WE HEARD THAT ONE OF\nGEORGE SOROS' COMPANIES HAS PROVIDED SOME OF THE MACHINES\nFOR SOME OF THE STATES. OBVIOUSLY MR. SOROS LEANS LEFT.\nI HAVEN'T PERSONALLY VERIFIED THAT YET.\nBUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE VOTING MACHINES ARE FREE\nOF POLITICS AND POLICY, BECAUSE THIS GREAT AMERICAN SYSTEM, THIS\nELECTION, IS BASED ON THE TRUST OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\nAND I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO UNDERMINE THAT TRUST IN OUR\nELECTORAL PROCESS. >> WE HAVE TO TAKE A QUICK\nBREAK. IT'S REPUBLICAN OFFICIALS IN\nTEXAS SAY THING IS NOT A BIG PROBLEM WITH THESE VOTING\nTABLETS, IF YOU WILL. AND THAT GEORGE SOROS ISSUE, IS\nAN UNCONFIRMED RUMOR THAT HAS SPREAD OUT THERE.\nBUT WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT BY ANY MEANS, THAT\nTHE MACHINES THAT HIS COMPANY IS BUILDING ARE DESIGNED TO HELP\nHILLARY CLINTON AND NOT DONALD TRUMP.\nTHAT SOUNDS CONSPIRATORIAL. BUT LET'S TAKE A QUICK BREAK,\nCONGRESSMAN. WE'LL RESUME OUR COVERAGE RIGHT\nAFTER THIS.",

WE'RE GETTING NEW INFORMATION\nABOUT VLADAMIR PUTIN'S LATEST RESPONSE TO CLAIMS THAT RUSSIA\nIS ATTEMPTING TO INFLUENCE THE U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.\nOUR CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT JIM SCIUTTO IS\nWITH US. JIM, PUTIN SAYS IT'S ALL A PLOY?\n>> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT. AND IT'S INTERESTING, BECAUSE WE\nHEARD DONALD TRUMP OCCASIONALLY PRAISE THE LEADERSHIP STYLE OF\nVLADAMIR PUTIN. TODAY, WE HEARD VLADAMIR PUTIN,\nTO SOME DEGREE, DEFENDING DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGNING STYLE, EVEN\nMAKING SOME POINTS, EXPRESSING TALKING POINTS SEEMINGLY STOLEN\nFROM THE DONALD TRUMP PLAYBOOK. HAVE A LISTEN.\n>> Translator: DONALD TRUMP BEHAVES EXTRAVAGANTLY.\nOF COURSE WE SEE THIS. BUT THERE'S A REASON FOR THIS.\nIN MANY OPINION, HE REPRESENTS THE INTERESTS OF THAT PART OF\nSOCIETY, AND IT IS QUITE BIG IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH IS\nTIRED OF THE ELITE THAT HAVE BEEN IN POWER FOR DECADES.\n>> Reporter: TIRED OF THE ELITE THAT HAVE BEEN IN POWER FOR\nDECADES. YOU HEARD DONALD TRUMP SAY THAT\nABOUT HILLARY CLINTON IN THE LAST DEBATE.\nBUT ON THIS ISSUE WHO IS BEHIND THESE ELECTION HACKS, RUSSIA HAS\nDENIED THAT FROM THE BEGINNING. VLADAMIR PUTIN HAS DENIED THAT\nMULTIPLE TIMES. HAVE A LISTEN.\n>> Translator: DOES ANYONE SERIOUSLY THINK THAT RUSSIA CAN\nIN SOME WAY INFLUENCE THE CHOICE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE?\nIS AMERICA SOME KIND OF A BANANA REPUBLIC?\nAMERICA IS A GREAT COUNTRY, CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG.\n>> Reporter: THE COULD THERE WENT ON TO HALF AT THAT A LITTLE\nBIT THERE, THIS IDEA OF AMERICA AS A BANANA REPUBLIC.\nBUT THE FACT IS, U.S. INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES TOOK THE\nRARE STEP OF NAMING AND SHAMING RUSSIA IN PUBLIC FOR THESE\nHACKS, EVEN SAYING IT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED THE MOST SENIOR LEVELS\nOF THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT, NAMELY VLADAMIR PUTIN, TO\nAPPROVE HACKS LIKE THIS. >> JIM SCIUTTO, THANK YOU VERY\nMUCH FOR THAT REPORT. LET'S GET BACK TO CONGRESSMAN\nSEAN DUFFY. CONGRESSMAN, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE\nHOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE SAYS HE TOLD TRUMP RUSSIA WAS BEHIND\nTHESE ELECTION HACKS. TRUMP DIDN'T THINK THAT WAS\nENOUGH PROOF. TRUMP IS ALSO QUESTIONING HIS\nREPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES AND THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY FOR THAT\nMATTER, WHEN GENERALS AS FAR AS THIS ONGOING FIGHT AGAINST ISIS,\nWHEN YOU HEAR ALL OF THIS FROM TRUMP, HOW WILL HE FUNCTION IF\nHE'S ELECTED AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IF HE DOESN'T\nTRUST THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, FOR EXAMPLE?\n>> WELL, JUST TO TAKE A SIDE NOTE, IT'S BARACK OBAMA THAT'S\nBEEN CHANGING THE INTELLIGENCE COMING OUT OF THE MIDDLE EAST TO\nMAKE IT ROSIER -- >> ARE YOU ACCUSING THE DIRECTOR\nOF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, THE CIA DIRECTOR, THE NSA DIRECTOR,\nALL 16, 17 INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES OF BEING MANIPULATED BY THE\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR POLITICAL REASONS?\n>> NO, WHAT I'M SAYING IS, AND THESE ARE WELL VETTED STORIES\nABOUT INSIDERS WHO HAVE PROVIDED REPORTS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN\nTHE MIDDLE EAST WITH IRAQ, SYRIA, WITH AFGHANISTAN, OF\nMODIFYING THE REPORTS THAT HAVE COME OUT OF THEIR INTELLIGENCE\nORGANIZATIONS -- >> IS MIKE McCAUL --\n[ OVERLAPPING SPEAKERS ] MIKE McCAUL IS A REPUBLICAN,\nHE'S FROM TEXAS, HIGHLY RESPECTED.\nIS HE BEING MANIPULATED, AS WELL?\n>> I DIDN'T SAY THAT HE WAS. I SAID THAT THE MID LEVEL FOLKS\nTHAT ARE WRITING REPORTS ON THE GROUND, REPORTING ON OUR\nEFFECTIVENESS IN THE MIDDLE EAST ON OUR POLICIES, THOSE REPORTS\nHAVE BEEN MODIFIED AND THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE WRITTEN REPORTS\nHAVE COME FORWARD AND EXPRESSED THAT IN PUBLIC.\nMIKE McCAUL IS A STRAIGHT SHOOTING GUY AND A FRIEND OF\nMINE, BUT I THINK HE'S HEARD THE SAME STORY.\nI'M NOT SAYING THAT THESE REPORTS ARE WRONG THAT ARE\nCOMING OUT ABOUT RUSSIA. ALL I'M SAYING IS, YOUR QUESTION\nWENT TO THE POINT IS, CAN YOU BE AN EFFECTIVE PRESIDENT IF YOU\nHAVE BAD INTELLIGENCE? WELL, MR. OBAMA HAS BEEN AN\nEFFECTIVE PRESIDENT, SOME WOULD SAY HE HASN'T, BUT HE'S HAD BAD\nINTELLIGENCE. >> I SAID IF HE'S NOT LISTENING\nTO THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, CAN YOU BE AN EFFECTIVE\nPRESIDENT IF YOU DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO THEIR CONCLUSIONS?\n>> LET'S GO TO THE POINT. I DON'T CARE IF IT'S RUSSIA, IF\nIT'S THE TOOTH FAIRY OR THE DEVIL THAT PROVIDES THIS\nINFORMATION. THE BOTTOM LINE IS, WE'RE SEEING\nA PAY FOR PLAY SCANDAL. YOU GIVE MONEY TO THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION, YOU GET ACCESS TO THE CLINTON STATE DEPARTMENT.\n>> DO YOU CARE -- HOLD ON. DO YOU CARE IF RUSSIA IS TRYING\nTO INTERFERE BY HACKING VARIOUS E-MAIL ACCOUNTS, DNC, OR OTHER\nE-MAIL ACCOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH DEMOCRATS, DO YOU CARE IF\nTHEY'RE TRYING TO INFLUENCE THE AMERICAN ELECTION SYSTEM SO THAT\nTRUMP IS ELECTED? >> WHAT I WOULD ARGUE IS IF --\nDO I CARE ABOUT THAT? OF COURSE.\nBUT THEN IF WE HAVE THIS INFORMATION THROUGH THE\nINTELLIGENCE SERVICES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, LET'S\nPUT IT OUT THERE. LET'S SHOW HOW RUSSIA IS\nACTUALLY DOING THIS. >> BUT YOU KNOW, CONGRESSMAN,\nSOMETIMES THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY -- HOLD ON A SECOND.\nTHEY HAVE TO PROTECT WHAT THEY CALL SOURCES AND METHODS.\nTHEY CAN'T NECESSARILY REVEAL THAT KIND OF INFORMATION,\nBECAUSE IT UNDERMINES NATIONAL SECURITY.\nYOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THAT. >> BUT THERE'S A LOT OF SOURCES\nAND A LOT OF INFORMATION THEY CAN RELEASE WITHOUT RELEASING\nALL OF IT AND JEOPARDIZING THE TOOLS THAT THEY USE TO GET THAT\nINFORMATION. THAT ASIDE, WOLF, I DON'T THINK\nIT HELPS DONALD TRUMP AT ALL TO HAVE ANY TIES TO PUTIN.\nIF ANYONE THINKS THAT PUTIN SAYING NICE THINGS ABOUT DONALD\nTRUMP IS HELPFUL IN THIS ELECTION, IT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT.\nMR. PUTIN IS A THUG. HE'S NOT A FRIEND OF OURS.\nAND I THINK ANYONE THAT COZIES UP OR SAYS NICE THINGS ABOUT MR.\nPUTIN, I DISAGREE WITH. IF THE RUSSIANS TRYING TO HELP\nDONALD TRUMP, WHY WOULD MR. PUTIN SAY NICE THINGS ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP? HE KNOWS THAT STIRS UP A LOT OF\nANGER WITHIN THE AMERICAN VOTING BASE.\n>> WHAT'S INTRIGUING TO A LOT OF EXPERTS, AND I'M SURE IT IS TO\nYOU, AT LEAST SO FAR, ALL OF THE H\nHACKED E-MAILS HAVE BEEN DAMAGING TO THE DEMOCRATS, NOT\nTHE REPUBLICANS. NO TRUMP CAMPAIGN EMAILS HAVE\nBEEN HACKED. THAT'S WHY PEOPLE ARE POINTING\nTO THE RUSSIANS, BY AND LARGE, SAYING IT'S DESIGNED TO\nUNDERMINE HILLARY CLINTON AND THE DEMOCRATS AND HELP TRUMP.\nTHAT'S THE ARGUMENT. >> AND I UNDERSTAND THE\nARGUMENT, AND I KIND OF LOOK TO WHAT MARCO RUBIO SAID.\nI DON'T KNOW THAT ANY OF US LIKE WHEN E-MAILS ARE HACKED.\nTHEY SHOULD BE PRIVATE. BUT I WOULD ALSO NOTE, WOLF,\nTHAT THERE'S A LOT OF SERIOUS THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING WITHIN\nCLINTON WORLD THAT HAVE COME OUT THAT GIVE PEOPLE GREAT PAUSE\nABOUT HER ABILITY TO SERVE EFFECTIVELY AS THE NEXT\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\nWE HAVE ISSUES OF, AGAIN, CORRUPTION.\nTHE FACT THAT SHE HAD THIS PRIVATE SERVER AND DIDN'T\nPROTECT AMERICAN TOP SECRET INFORMATION.\nTHE FACT THAT SHE CAME TO CONGRESS AND SAID SHE DIDN'T\nHAVE THIS SECURE INFORMATION ON A SERVER AND MR. COMEY SAID NO,\nON THAT SERVER, SHE DID HAVE TOP SECRET INFORMATION.\nALL OF THIS IS RELEVANT, AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT -- AND I\nTOLD YOU THIS BEFORE -- I WANT TO KNOW AS MUCH INFORMATION\nABOUT HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP.\nI WANT TO KNOW THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY SO I CAN MAKE\nTHE BEST DECISION ON NOVEMBER 8th.\nI THINK EVERY AMERICAN DESERVES THAT.\nAS YOU'VE SEEN FROM THESE E-MAILS, I WISH HILLARY CLINTON\nWOULD HAVE DONE WHAT HER STAFFERS ADVISED HER, PUT OUT\nTHE PAID SPEECHES FROM WALL STREET, DON'T BLEACH BIT 30,000\nPAGES OF E-MAILS. IF SHE DID THAT, SHE WOULD BE\nWALKING AWAY WIT, BECAUSE SHE WAS HONEST AND TRANSPARENT AND\nASKED FOR FORGIVENESS AND AMERICANS GIVE FORGIVENESS WHEN\nYOU ASK FOR IT. >> YOU MAKE FAIR POINTS ON THAT\nISSUE, WHICH IS A FAIR ISSUE FOR DISCUSSION, BUT IT'S SEPARATE\nWHETHER OR NOT RUSSIA IS DELIBERATELY RELEASING STOLEN OR\nHACKED E-MAILS IN ORDER TO INTERFERE IN THE AMERICAN\nDEMOCRATIC ELECTION SYSTEM. THOSE ARE TWO SEPARATE ISSUES\nTHAT WE'RE DISCUSSING RIGHT NOW. >> THEY ARE.\n>> WE'LL CONTINUE THESE CONVERSATIONS DOWN THE ROAD.\nCONGRESSMAN, APPRECIATE IT VERY",

      "text": ">>> BACK IT OUR POLITICAL\nEXPERTS. BRIANNA KEILAR, LET'S TALK ABOUT\nTHIS IMPORTANT JOINT EVENT TODAY, THE FIRST LADY OF THE\nUNITED STATES, HILLARY CLINTON -- MICHELLE OBAMA, SHE\nWAS SPEAKING MOSTLY POSITIVELY, SENDING A POSITIVE MESSAGE ABOUT\nHILLARY CLINTON. NEVER MENTIONED DONALD TRUMP'S\nNAME AT ALL, BUT DIDN'T REALLY GO AFTER HIM THAT MUCH.\nAN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY? >> THAT'S RIGHT.\nI THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO KEEP THINGS A LITTLE MORE POSITIVE.\nRIGHT AFTER THE \"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD\" TAPE CAME OUT,\nMICHELLE OBAMA WAS PERHAPS ONE OF -- I THINK SHE MIGHT HAVE\nBEEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE PERSON SPEAKING OUT AGAINST IT.\nA COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO IN NEW HAMPSHIRE SHE HAD THE STRONGEST\nOF WORDS FOR DONALD TRUMP. SHOCKING, DEMEANING, THAT HE WAS\nBELOW THE BASIC STANDARDS OF DECENCY.\nTODAY SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT DIVISIONS AND SAID\nTHAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS A DIFFERENT VISION THAT HAS MORE\nTO DO WITH TOGETHERNESS. BUT I THINK WHAT'S REALLY\nAMAZING ABOUT THIS APPEARANCE IS JUST THAT SHE IS THERE, SO\nWHOLEHEARTEDLY CAMPAIGNING FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nEIGHT YEARS AGO IF SOMEONE HAD TOLD YOU THAT THIS WOULD HAVE\nHAPPENED, ONE, THAT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN BESTIES UP THERE, SORT\nOF HUGGING IT OUT BEFORE, OR THAT MICHELLE OBAMA WOULD BE\nPROBABLY THE BEST SURROGATE OUT THERE, I MEAN, EIGHT YEARS AGO\nSHE HAD TO HAVE A WHOLE IMAGE REHAB BECAUSE SHE WAS SEEN AS\nDIVISIVE. NOW SHE IS NOT.\nSHE IS AN ADDITIVE. >> WHAT WAS ALSO INTERESTING,\nJACKIE, WAS THE FACT THAT THE FIRST LADY WAS INTRODUCED BY\nHILLARY CLINTON, USUALLY IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND.\n>> SHE WAS THE HEADLINER TODAY. IT'S BEEN INTERESTING TO SEE\nHILLARY CLINTON SORT OF ADOPT WHAT MICHELLE OBAMA HAS BEEN\nSAYING ON THE TRAIL, BE IT THE, THEY GO LOW, WE GO HIGH.\nYOU HEARD HILLARY CLINTON SAY SOME OF THE THINGS MICHELLE\nOBAMA SAID ABOUT -- IN EARLIER SPEECHES ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT\nAND THE TREATMENT OF WOMEN. SO SHE REALLY IS TRYING TO\nABSORB A LITTLE BIT OF THE CELEBRITY AND PANACHE THAT\nMICHELLE OBAMA BRINGS. >> MARK PRESTON, THE NEW\nQUINNIPIAC POLL POLLS. IN IOWA TIED 44-44.\nCLINTON AND TRUMP. IN GEORGIA OF ALL PLACES, TRUMP\n44, HILLARY CLINTON, 43. IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THAT WAY\nIN THOSE TWO STATES. HILLARY CLINTON WAS WAY BEHIND\nIN IOWA A MONTH AGO AND BEHIND IN GEORGIA, OF COURSE, AS WELL,\nIT'S A RED STATE. >> THE LAST TIME DEMOCRATS WON\nGEORGIA, WOLF, WAS BILL CLINTON IN 1992.\nIT GOT VERY, VERY RED. TEN YEARS FROM NOW IT WOULD SEEM\nTO MAKE SENSE BECAUSE OF DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES IN THAT\nSTATE AND IN OTHER STATES SUCH AS TEXAS.\nIT SHOWS YOU THAT TRUMP'S CANDIDACY, FOR ALL THAT HE IS\nATTRACTING, HE HAS ALSO PUSHED A LOT AWAY AT THE SAME TIME, THAT\nYOU ARE SEEING DEMOCRATS IN THAT STATE CONSOLIDATE.\nIN THE STATE OF IOWA, HILLARY CLINTON HAS NEVER DONE WELL\nTHERE. DIDN'T NECESSARILY DO WELL IN\nTHE CAUCUSES. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS TRUMP HAS\nDONE WELL, EVEN THOUGH HE LOST THE CAUCUSES THERE.\nYOU ARE SEEING A CONSOLIDATION OF SOCIAL CONSERVATIVES GETTING\nBEHIND TRUMP. THOSE NUMBERS RIGHT THERE, THE\nLAST TIME THAT REPUBLICANS WON IOWA, WAS IN 2004 WITH JOHN\nKERRY. BARACK OBAMA WON IT IN THE LAST\nTWO ELECTIONS. SO, IF HILLARY CLINTON COULD\nKNOCK OFF TRUMP IN GEORGIA AND IOWA, ELECTION OVER.\n>> DAVID AXELROD, ONLY MOMENTS AGO DONALD TRUMP SAID THIS IN\nTOLEDO. LET ME PLAY THE CLIP FOR YOU.\nLISTEN TO THIS. >> JUST THINKING TO MYSELF RIGHT\nNOW, WE SHOULD JUST CANCEL THE ELECTION AND JUST GIVE IT TO\nTRUMP, RIGHT? WHAT ARE WE HAVING IT?\n>> IT'S ALREADY GENERATING SOME BUZZ OUT THERE.\nYOU'RE SMILING WHEN YOU HEAR HIM SAY IT.\nHE THINKS HE'S DOING REALLY WELL.\n>> WELL, I THINK HE IS -- HE HAS EXPRESSED SOME CONCERN ABOUT HOW\nTHE ELECTION MIGHT COME OUT IF WE ACTUALLY HOLD ONE AND WHETHER\nHE'S GOING TO RECOGNIZE THE RESULT OF IT.\nSO I AM SURE HE WOULD PREFER A SITUATION WHERE WE COULD JUST BY\nACCLAMATION DECLARE THAT HE IS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nBUT THE NUMBERS ARE THE NUMBERS, AND THEY'RE PRETTY DAUNTING FOR\nHIM RIGHT NOW. THE DISCUSSION YOU JUST HAD WITH\nMARK SPEAKS TO IT. HE HAS SO ANTAGONIZED KEY\nCONSTITUENCIES IN SOME BATTLEGROUND STATES.\nIN MANY BATTLEGROUND STATES. COLLEGE-EDUCATED WOMEN,\nHISPANICS AND OTHER MINORITIES, YOUNGER VOTERS.\nTHAT HE HAS MADE IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIMSELF TO CLIMB\nTHIS HILL. >> MARK PRESTON, YOUR REACTION\nTO WHAT WE JUST HEARD FROM TRUMP?\nI SUSPECT HE WAS JUST TRYING TO BE FUNNY, CUTE AND SARCASTIC A\nLITTLE BIT OR WHATEVER. >> THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF\nTRUTH IN EVERYTHING DONALD TRUMP SAYS, THOUGH, AS IN WHAT EVERY\nPOLITICIAN SAYS. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY WHAT DONALD\nTRUMP SHOULDN'T BE DOING RIGHT NOW.\nWE TALKED BEFORE THE BREAK ABOUT STAYING ON MESSAGE.\nSAYING SOMETHING LIKE THAT JUST PLAYS TO THE CROWD, AND HE GETS\nENERGY OFF OF THAT, WOLF, BUT GUESS WHAT, IT DOESN'T REACH OUT\nTO ALL THE CONSTITUENCIES THAT DAVID JUST MENTIONED.\n>> STAY WITH US, EVERYBODY.",

GOOD TO SEE YOU.\n>> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU, CHUCK, ALWAYS.\n>> I'M GOING TO USE YOUR WORDS TO ME.\nACTUALLY TO BUFFALO NEWS A COUPLE DAYS AGO.\nYOU SAID THIS. \"THIS IS AMERICA.\nWERE TRUMP TO LOSE, HE WOULD ACCEPT THAT, AND HIS SUPPORTERS\nWOULD ACCEPT THAT. THIS IS AMERICA.\"\nWHY DO YOU THINK DONALD TRUMP WON'T SAY THAT?\n>> I MEANT WHAT I SAID. HE'LL ACCEPT THAT, AND HE SEEMS\nTO BE A LITTLE BIT STUCK ON THE IDEA THAT IF THERE IS A 100-VOTE\nDIFFERENCE IN FLORIDA, OF COURSE SOMEONE IS GOING TO CONTEST\nTHAT, THEY'RE GOING TO RECOUNT AND SO FORTH.\nI JUST THINK IT'S A BIT OF A DISTRACTION.\nI DON'T AGREE WITH THAT DISTRACTION, BUT I WILL TELL YOU\nHE GAVE A GREAT SPEECH IN OHIO TODAY.\nHE GAVE A LOT OF REASONS WHY PEOPLE SHOULD VOTE FOR HIM AS\nOPPOSED IT HILLARY AND MICHELLE OBAMA TALKING ABOUT REASONS WHY\nTHEY SHOULD VOTE AGAINST DONALD TRUMP.\nNOW, DONALD TRUMP BROUGHT UP SOME -- GO AHEAD.\n>> I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THIS BECAUSE I ACTUALLY WAS TALKING\nTO SOME FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN TRYING TO HELP DONALD TRUMP OUT,\nAND THEIR BIGGEST COMPLAINT IS THAT TRUMP DOESN'T SPEND ENOUGH\nTIME TALKING ABOUT GIVING VOTERS A REASON TO VOTE FOR HIM.\nYOU SAY HE SAYS THAT. AS YOU CAN SEE, HE SPENT A LOT\nOF TIME BASHING THE CLINTONS. WHAT ARE THE BEST THREE REASONS\nTO VOTE FOR TRUMP, IN YOUR OPINION, THAT DON'T HAVE\nANYTHING TO DO WITH THE CLINTONS?\n>> WELL, YOU CAN ALWAYS CONTRAST IT, BUT IT'S PUTTING AMERICA\nFIRST AND THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH SAYING THE CLINTONS PUT\nTHEMSELVES FIRST IN THE SAME BREATH BUT PUT AMERICA FIRST.\nSECURE OUR BORDERS, AND HILLARY HAS SAID SHE STANDS FOR OPEN\nBORDERS, SO THAT CONTRAST IS OKAY.\nON DEFEATING ISIS, ACCURATELY POINTING OUT WHY ISIS IS THERE,\nBECAUSE OF FAILURES IN OUR FOREIGN POLICIES CERTAINLY IN\nIRAQ AND SYRIA. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH\nGIVING THE PEOPLE THE REASONS FOR JOBS, JOBS AND JOBS, SECURE\nOUR BORDERS, STAND UP AND DEFEAT ISIS.\nAT THE SAME TIME, CONTRASTING TO HILLARY CLINTON THE SPEECH SHE\nGAVE IN OHIO TODAY, I JUST WISH HE HAD BEEN GIVING THAT SPEECH\nTHE LAST 60 DAYS. HE WOULD HAVE THIS ELECTION IN\nTHE BAG. WE DO HAVE 12 MORE DAYS TO GO,\nAND WE'VE SEEN, AT ONE POINT FOUR DAYS AGO, THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN WAS BASICALLY DECLARING VICTORY, AND OH, MY GOD, THEY'VE\nCOME ALL THE WAY BACK. NEVADA IS BACK IN PLAY.\nHE'S LEADING IN FLORIDA. >> I WANT TO TALK ABOUT\nSOMETHING ELSE DONALD TRUMP SAID ON ABC.\nIT HAS TO DO WITH THE RUSSIAN ISSUE.\nHERE IT IS AND LET ME GET TO YOU REACT TO IT.\n>> INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES BELIEVE THE RUSSIANS ARE BEHIND THAT\nLEAK. WHY DON'T YOU BELIEVE IT?\n>> I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE BEHIND IT AND I BELIEVE IT'S\nPUBLIC RELATIONS. PEOPLE ARE HACKING ALL OVER THE\nPLACE. >> CONGRESSMAN COLLINS, YOU'RE\nNOT ON THE REPUBLICAN COMMITTEE, BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE ON THE\nREPUBLICAN COMMITTEE BOTH IN THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE.\nDONALD TRUMP IS BEING BRIEFED ON THIS, IS BEING TOLD ESSENTIALLY\nTHE RUSSIANS ARE BEHIND THIS. WHY IS HE CALLING OUR\nPROFESSIONAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES INTO QUESTION, AND DOES\nTHAT CONCERN YOU? >> I DON'T THINK IT CONCERNS ME,\nBECAUSE THEY CAN'T SAY WITH 100%.\nI DO AGREE, THE RUSSIANS ARE PROBABLY BEHIND THE HACKING, SO\nI DO TEND TO ACCEPT THAT. EVEN THE SECURITY OFFICIALS WILL\nSAY IT'S 99%, NOT 100. AGAIN, I WISH THAT'S SOMETHING\nMR. TRUMP WOULD MOVE OFF OF. .\nAND THIS $116 MILLION THAT WENT TO BILL CLINTON, THEY'RE CALLING\nHIM BUBBA AND SAYING THIS IS ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE ISSUES THAT\nTHE CLINTON FAMILY FIRST AND, BUT I DON'T DISAGREE, AND I WILL\nTELL YOU AGAIN, IF HE GAVE THE SPEECH HE GAVE IN OHIO TODAY, HE\nWOULD BE IN THE LEAD, AND FOR ME AS A SUPPORTER, I HOPE IT STAYS\nTHAT WAY THE NEXT 12 DAYS. >> I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT\nSOMETHING JASON CHAVITS HAS SAID ABOUT A COUPLE THINGS.\nHE'S GONE BACK AND FORTH ENDORSING DONALD TRUMP.\nTHEN HE SAID HE WASN'T ENDORSING HIM BUT HE WAS VOTING FOR HIM.\nI'LL LET OTHERS SAY HOW WE REDEFINE THOSE WORDS THESE DAYS.\nHE SAID HE WAS GETTING READY TO INVESTIGATE HILLARY CLINTON AS\nPRESIDENT. YOU SAY THE BRAKES NEED TO BE\nTAPPED ON THAT. EXPLAIN WHAT YOUR CONCERN WAS\nABOUT THAT LANGUAGE. >> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A DIVIDED\nNATION AT THE END OF THIS ELECTION REGARDLESS OF WHO WINS.\nWE'RE DIVIDED RIGHT NOW. WE NEED THIS NATION TO HEAL.\nWE NEED TO DO THAT BY TALKING ABOUT ISSUES, SOME CERTAIN LEVEL\nOF COMPROMISE ALTHOUGH IT WILL BE DIFFERENT TO COMPROMISE A\nREPUBLICAN CONSERVATIVE AGENDA WITH THAT WHICH WOULD BE A\nPROGRESSIVE SOCIALIST AGENDA, BUT I DO BELIEVE THERE ARE SOME\nAREAS, CORPORATE TAX REFORM IS ONE.\nIF WE TAKE AWAY CITIZENSHIP FOR THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, I THINK\nWE CAN PUT TOGETHER A VERY STRONG IMMIGRATION PACKAGE.\nBUT I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO START RIGHT AWAY IF MRS. CLINTON\nWAS ELECTED AND MAKE IT APPEAR, YOU KNOW, THAT THERE IS A WITCH\nHUNT. NOW, SHE DOES NEED TO ANSWER TO\nSOME THINGS. THERE MAY BE SOME ISSUES THAT\nHAVE COME UP THAT WE WOULD LIKE ANSWERS TO.\nHOPEFULLY THOSE WOULD BE FORTHCOMING.\nBUT IF SHE IS ELECTED PRESIDENT, SHE'LL SERVE FOR FOUR YEARS.\nI'M GOING TO BE THE OPTIMIST THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER ON\nSOME AREAS, BUT THAT WILL IN MANY CASES DEPEND ON HER\nRHETORIC AND HOW SHE MOVES FORWARD.\n>> LET ME ASK YOU THIS. HOW DIVISIVE INSIDE THE\nREPUBLICAN CONFERENCE IS SUPPORT FOR TRUMP OR NOT TRUMP MEAN FOR\nPOST ELECTION? DOES PAUL RYAN HAVE PROBLEMS\nINSIDE YOUR CONFERENCE? DOES HE HAVE THE CONFIDENCE OF\nENOUGH REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE TO STAY SPEAKER AFTER THIS\nELECTION IF YOU GUYS HOLD THE MAJORITY?\n>> I DO, CHUCK. PAUL RYAN HAS DONE A FABULOUS\nJOB IN KEEPING OUR CONFERENCE UNITED.\nHE IS A VERY OPEN PROCESS AND THEY'RE GOING WITH 4:00 IN THE\nAFTERNOON RATHER THAN 6:00. >> YOU WILL NOT BLAME PAUL RYAN\nFOR A TRUMP LOSS. >> NO, NOT AT ALL.\nHE WAS LUKEWARM FROM THE BEGINNING, AND HIS FOCUS HAS\nBEEN ON MAKING SURE WE HAVE A MAJORITY AND THE BIGGEST\nMAJORITY WE CAN HAVE GOING INTO THE NEXT CONGRESS, AND SO THAT'S\nBEEN HIS FOCUS AND I'M FINE WITH THAT, AND OUR CONFERENCE IS\nUNITED BEHIND HIM. FRANKLY, I'M NOT SURE ANYONE\nELSE WOULD WANT THAT JOB, IT'S THE MOST DIFFICULT JOB IN THE\nWORLD. >> YOU JUST CRACKED UP THE\nENTIRE PANEL HERE WITH THAT ANSWER THERE.\nANYWAY, CONGRESSMAN CHRIS COLLINS FOR WESTERN NEW YORK,\nALWAYS APPRECIATE YOU COMING ON THE SHOW AND SHARING YOUR VIEWS.\n>> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU. >> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU, TOO.\nYOU GUYS STARTED TO GIGGLE ON THAT LINE.\nCHIEF CORRESPONDENT POLITICO AND SENIOR POLITICO REPORTER SUSAN\nPAGE FROM USA TODAY. GLEN, YOUR CHUCKLE WAS THE\nLOUDEST, I THINK. >> IT'S FLOSSING THE ALLIGATORS\nAT THE ZOO JOB, RIGHT? >> NOBODY WANTS THAT JOB.\nIT'S INTERESTING TO HEAR CHRIS COLLINS.\nI'VE HEARD THIS FROM MORE AND MORE TRUMP SUPPORTERS.\nTHEY SOUND MORE LIKE HIM. THEY'RE LAMENTING.\n>> YES. HE ACTUALLY SAID IT WILL BE A\nWITCH HUNT. HE LAID OUT WHAT WE COULD DO\nWITH HILLARY CLINTON. >> HE SHORT-CIRCUITED IT, BUT\nI'LL CLARIFY WHEN HE SAID YOU HAVE TO MAKE A PATH TO\nCITIZENSHIP. THE PATH TO LEGALIZATION RATHER\nTHAN THE PATH TO CITIZENSHIP HAS ALWAYS BEEN A STICKY POINT.\n>> WE CAN WORK TOGETHER WITH HER ON SOME ISSUES, WE CAN\nINVESTIGATE EVERYTHING. THERE ARE SOME WHO WANT TO HAVE\nMORE. WE TALKED TO OTHERS WHO SAID NO,\nIT WAS THE WHOLE CAUCUS. YOU HEARD ALMOST A WHOLE TRUMP\nVISION FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, WHICH I WAS STRUCK BY.\n>> I WAS, TOO. SUSAN, AS I'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW\nCHRIS COLLINS A LITTLE BIT, HE'S SORT OF THE ANGEL ON TRUMP'S\nSHOULDER. IF TRUMP IS RESHAPING OUR\nREPUBLICAN PARTY, NOT DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF BUT THE NEW TRUMP\nVOTERS, CHRIS COLLINS IS REPRESENTATIVE OF WESTERN NEW\nYORK, BLUE COLLAR DISTRICT, REALLY, THEY DON'T CARE AS MUCH\nABOUT THE SOCIAL ISSUES. HE COULD BE A GUY TO WATCH HERE.\n>> WHO IS THE DEVIL ON THE OTHER SHOULDER?\n>> POSSIBLY ROGER STONE. >> HERE IS WHERE IT'S\nINTERESTING. A BIG SUPPORTER OF TRUMP, RIGHT?\n>> FIRST GUY IN CONGRESS TO SUPPORT HIM.\n>> HE IS PREPARED TO MOVE PAST TRUMP.\nHE'S BASICALLY SAYING HE MAY WELL LOSE, AND IF HE LOSES, WE\nNEED TO BE COOPERATIVE, WE NEED TO TRY SOME COMPROMISES, WE NEED\nTO DELAY GOING AFTER THE NEW PRESIDENT.\n12 DAYS UNTIL THE ELECTION. IT'S NOT LIKE THE ELECTION IS\nTHIS AFTERNOON. >> CAN YOU IMAGINE EVEN A\nHYPOTHETICAL? THEN HE HAD THIS LAMENT ON IF HE\nHAD ADOPTED THE TONE, LOOK WHERE WE WOULD BE.\nA LOT OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS ARE MOVING PAST HIM BUT THE POINT\nYOU MAKE ABOUT THE COE MESSAGE AND TRUMP OUTLASTING TRUMP, I\nTHINK YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT COLLINS.\nHE'S GOT THAT LASTING MESSAGE. >> I'LL BE CURIOUS TO WATCH HIM\nAND A FEW OTHERS. I WANT TO GO TO THIS JASON\nCHAVITZ THING. HOW MUCH HE SAID YESTERDAY FELT\nLIKE THE FIRST CAMPAIGN PITCH TO SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE?\nI DON'T MEAN TO BE THAT CYNICAL ABOUT IT, BUT IS IT?\n>> I SORT OF READ McCAIN'S COMMENTS THAT WE'LL BLOCK\nEVERYTHING FOREVER, TED CRUZ'S COMMENTS THAT WE ONLY NEED EIGHT\nPEOPLE, ALL THIS POSITIONING FOR THE FUTURE SHOWING THAT THEY'RE\nGOING TO BE FIRING AGAINST HILLARY, MAKING SURE THE BASE\nKNOWS THAT TED CRUZ IS GOING TO RUN FOR REELECTION IN 2018.\nI THINK OF THOSE THINGS AS MORE POSITIONING AND THEY DON'T\nNECESSARILY REFLECT WHAT THE PARTIES WILL DO.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT MICHELLE OBAMA.\nSOMEBODY SAID THIS IN MULTIPLE  THERE IS ONE WINNER IN THIS\nELECTION. IT'S MICHELLE OBAMA.\nSHE HAS TURNED INTO THE STAR. >> WHO IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT\nAT THAT RALLY? WHO SEEMED LIKE THE PERSON\nRUNNING FOR PRESIDENT? SHE'S JUST SO GOOD ON THE STUMP.\nIT'S NOT LIKE SHE'S HAD TONS OF PRACTICE BECAUSE SHE'S DONE\nRELATIVELY FEW OF THESE. ONLY WHEN SHE NEEDS TO DO IT\nWILL SHE DO IT. >> THIS ELECTION IS OBAMA'S\nVISION OF AMERICA AND TRUMP'S VISION OF AMERICA AND IT JUST\nHAPPENS TO BE HILLARY CLINTON AS THE NOMINEE.\n>> IT ALMOST SEEMS LIKE MICHELLE OBAMA OUGHT TO BE THE NOMINEE,\nRIGHT? JUST IN TERMS OF HER\nPERFORMANCE. >> PERFORMANCEWISE, YES.\n>> PEOPLE FORGET THAT IN CHARLOTTE IN 2012, SHE PROBABLY\nGAVE THE BEST SPEECH OF THAT CONVENTION.\nBILL CLINTON OVERSHADOWED HER. AND I THOUGHT IN 2016, SHE\nCLEARLY HAD THE BEST SPEECH. >> SHE HAD THE BEST ANTI-TRUMP\nSPEECH, TOO, DURING THIS CAMPAIGN AND THE SPEECH SHE GAVE\nAFTER THE RELEASE OF ACCESS HOLLYWOOD.\n>> AND SHE'S SO FOCUSED. SHE'S IN THESE PLACES AND\nREMINDING VOTERS, AND WE JUST SAW NUMBERS COME OUT, THAT THE\nTURNOUT IN VIRGINIA HAS NOT BEEN GREAT IN THE EARLY VOTING.\nSHE IS ALWAYS SUCH A FOCUSED SURROGATE.\nSHE ALWAYS MAKES SURE TO MAKE THE CLOSING ARGUMENT.\n>> YOU WANT ONE LAST POINT? >> TODAY'S SPEECH, HILLARY\nINTRODUCED MICHELLE. SHE WAS WITH MICHELLE FOR ABOUT\n30 MINUTES. SHE MENTIONED THE VOTERS\nOPPRESSION STORY WAS OUT TLT. IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND -- SHE\nSORT OF WORKED THE NEWS IN",

CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF IS A\nHILLARY CLINTON SUPPORTER. HE'S BACK WITH ME NOW. WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW.\n>> THANK YOU. GOOD TO BE HERE.\n>> DO YOU THINK SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE POLITICAL DISTRACTION IT\nCOULD BE THAT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION IN SOME FORM EITHER\nHAS TO BE SHUT DOWN OR CHANGED? >> I THINK IT SHOULD PROBABLY BE\nDIVORCED FROM THE FAMILY, AND -- >> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?\n>> I THINK THE FOUNDATION HAS DONE TREMENDOUS WORK AND\nCONTINUES TO DO TREMENDOUS WORK, AND I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO\nWANT TO KEEP THAT LEGACY ALIVE, BUT I THINK THE FAMILY ITSELF\nSHOULD SEPARATE FROM IT SO THAT THERE'S A CLEAN BREAK WITH THE\nWHITE HOUSE. I THINK THAT WOULD BE IN THE\nBEST INTERESTS OF THE NEW PRESIDENT, AND THAT'S WHAT I\nWOULD SUGGEST. I DO THINK, THOUGH, LOOKING AT\nTHE PICTURE OF THE CAMPAIGN RIGHT NOW, THESE NEW RUSSIAN\nHACKED DOCUMENTS, RUSSIAN LEAKED DOCUMENTS AREN'T LIKELY TO\nCHANGE THE DYNAMIC. I THINK POSSIBLY AT THE TOP OF\nTHE TICKET OR DOWN BALLOT. I THINK RAISING THE PREMIUMS IS\nMORE OF AN ISSUE FOR THE DOWN BALLOT CANDIDATES, AND I WOULD\nURGE THE DOWN BALLOT CANDIDATES THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE THEY HAVE\nTO DISCUSS AND ADDRESS. THAT, I THINK, IS PROBABLY THE\nBIGGER CHALLENGE THIS WEEK. >> LET ME ASK YOU, THOUGH, GOING\nBACK TO THE FOUNDATION. WHAT THIS MEMO SHOWED IS HOW\nPOTENTIALLY CORRUPTIBLE IT COULD BE IF YOU ALSO HAVE ACCESS TO\nTHE HIGHEST OFFICE IN THE LAND. PRESIDENT CLINTON WAS A PRIVATE\nCITIZEN AT THE TIME. IT IS A CONCERN WHAT THIS LOOKS\nLIKE IF SUDDENLY IT LOOKS LIKE CORPORATE DONORS CAN ESSENTIALLY\nBUY ACCESS TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nSO HOW DO YOU DIVORCE IT WITHOUT A TOTAL SHUTDOWN?\nDO YOU THINK THAT IS POSSIBLE? >> I DO THINK IT'S POSSIBLE.\nI THINK WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT THE FAMILY SHOULDN'T BE INVOLVED\nIN THE FOUNDATION AND THAT OTHERS WHO ARE HOLY AND\nINDEPENDENT OF THE PIRS FAMILY SHOULD RUN IT.\nI THINK THAT IS IMMINENTLY DOABLE.\n>> WE CAN'T DO ANY FUNDRAISERS OR PAID SPEECHES IF SHE'S\nPRESIDENT? >> I THINK WHAT IT MEANS, AND\nAGAIN, I'M IF NOT AN EXPERT IN THIS AREA.\nAS A PRACTICAL MATTER, YOU FOCUS ON THE JOB AT HAND WHICH IS\nBEING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nANYTHING THAT DETRACTS FROM THAT DISTRACTION IS JUST NOT WORTH\nDOING. THAT'S WHAT I SUGGEST.\n>> LET'S GO TO HEALTH CARE. IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE ADVICE\nFOR DEMOCRATS WHO DON'T KNOW HOW TO HANDLE THIS.\nYOU THINK IT'S A TOUGH ISSUE FOR DEMOCRATS.\n>> IT'S AN ISSUE I THINK THEY NEED TO ADDRESS, AND THERE MAY\nBE CHANGES IN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHICH WE HAVE BEEN\nTRYING TO MAKE. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A PARTY IN\nCONGRESS THAT BASICALLY SAYS REPEAL OR NO AND AREN'T WILLING\nTO WORK ON IT. THEY ARE AFRAID TO MAKE ANY\nIMPROVEMENTS BECAUSE THAT'S ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT IT'S GOING\nTO CONTINUE. I WOULD TALK ABOUT THAT AS A\nCANDIDATE, I WOULD TALK ABOUT HOW I'M TRYING TO MAKE CHANGES\nAND IMPROVEMENTS, DRIVE DOWN COST, INCREASE COMPETITION.\nI WOULDN'T SIMPLY BE A CHEERLEADER --\n>> LET ME STOP YOU HERE. GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE.\nWHAT IS A FIX, A SIMPLE BILL, THAT COULD BE PASSED THAT'S\nREALISTIC THAT WOULD INCREASE CHANGES?\n>> I THINK ONE IS A PUBLIC AUCTION THAT WOULD DRIVE DOWN\nCOSTS BECAUSE YOU WOULD -- >> WITH A DEMOCRAT CONTROLLED\nHOUSE AND SENATE, MIND YOU, AND COULDN'T GET IT.\n>>. EFFORTS AT INCREASING\nCOMPETITION WITHIN THE EXCHANGES, IDENTIFYING WHY ARE\nSOME OF THE PLANS DROPPING OUT OF THOSE EXCHANGES, BUT THE\nBOTTOM LINE IS WE WANT TO KEEP PROTECTIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH\nPREEXISTING CONDITIONS, WHICH MEANS THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO\nACQUIRE INSURANCE, HEALTHY OR SICK.\nAND WHAT REPUBLICANS HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO ANSWER IS, OKAY,\nTHEY HAVE CRITICISMS ABOUT THE PLAN, THEY HAVE NO PLAN OF THEIR\nOWN. THEY SAY THEY'RE GOING TO\nPROTECT BOEM PREEXISTING CONDITIONS, BUT THEY CAN'T\nREALLY MEAN IT. SO THESE ARE THINGS, I THINK,\nTHAT THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES NEED TO ADDRESS HEAD ON AND I\nTHINK THEY NEED TO LOOK AT THE OTHER PARTY THAT WON'T FIX THESE\nPROBLEMS. >> WHAT DO YOU THINK IF THERE'S\nA BIG WAVE? >> THIS IS THE KIND OF ELECTION\nTHERE MAY BE A BIG WAVE. IF VOTERS TURN OUT LIKE WE THINK\nTHEY WILL. IF DONALD TRUMP VOTERS TURN OUT\nLIKE THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO.\nAND THE CLINTON SUPPORTERS, IF THEY CAN'T BRING THEMSELVES TO\nVOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP AT ALL, THAT HAS THE MAKINGS OF A HUGE\nWAVE. WE WON'T KNOW UNTIL NOVEMBER 9,\nBUT WE COULD HAVE A CHANGE IN THE HOUSE WITH THAT KIND OF\nWAVE. >> THE WAY YOU GUYS COUNT IN\nCALIFORNIA, WE WON'T KNOW UNTIL NOVEMBER 11 IF IT'S CLOSE.\nYOU'VE GOT EXPERIENCE WITH THAT, TOO, I BELIEVE.\n>> FOR THE COUNTRY'S SAKE, NOBODY WANTS TO WAIT A MINUTE\nMORE THAN THEY HAVE TO IN THIS ELECTION.\n>> I THINK ON A PRESIDENTIAL LEVEL, AT THE HOUSE IT COULD\nTAKE A FEW DAYS. CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF ON\nBEHALF OF THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN. THANKS.\n>> THANKS, CHUCK.",

THIS IS A COMPANY THAT'S BEEN ON\nA BIT OF A TEAR FOR THEM. I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO GO\nBANANAS ON THE STACK. THIS IS A MUCH MORE DEFENSIVE\nPLAY WITH ALL THESE GUYS WHO THINK THAT THE CONSUMER IS\nFALLING APART AND THE MARKET IS ABOUT TO CRASH, THIS IS THE ONE\nTO BE IN. >> WHO SAID THAT?\n>> CONSUMERS, I'M HEARING S&P IS GOING DOWN.\n>> YOU SAID THE CONSUMER IS DEAD.\n>> GOING TO TAKE DOWN THE S&P. >> I MEAN, CRASH IS A LOADED\nWORD. >> YOU SHOULDN'T BE EATING THOSE\nDURING THE SHOW.

IN TERMS OF THE TRADE IN TECH\nTOMORROW, WILL IT BE CHALLENGED BECAUSE OF AMAZON?\n>> IT HAS TO BE. IT HAS TO BE, RIGHT?\n>> YOU'VE GOT GOOGLE ON ONE SIDE, AMAZON ON THE OTHER,\nMICROSOFT. >> WE'LL PROBABLY GO NOWHERE.\n>> THE MOVE FROM GOOGLE TO AMAZON.\n>> A STOCK THAT'S GONE FROM 300 TO 800, USING YOUR OWN MATH,\nIT'S DISAPPOINTING, IT TRADES DOWN 5%, AND THAT'S A REASON FOR\nTHE MARKET TO SELL OFF? >> I SAID IT TRADED FROM 700 TO\n500 IN THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR.\nI SAID I'M NOT EXPECTING A 28% MOVE THIS TIME.\nWHAT I DID SAY WAS THERE'S A CHANCE IT COULD TRADE DOWN TO\n700. GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE S&P IN\nMY OPINION IS AT A CRITICAL LEVEL, THERE'S A CHANCE THAT\nBOTH OF THEM START TO WORK OFF ONE ANOTHER.\nIS THAT CLEAR ENOUGH? >> CRASH.\n>> I DIDN'T SAY CRASH.",

FROM FEBRUARY ON, IT NEVER\nLOOKED BACK UNTIL THIS WEEK, IT'S IN POSITIVE TERRITORY.\nI THINK THOSE TWO STORIES, ALONG WITH THE NOTION OF HOW NEGATIVE\nRATES, WHAT EUROPE'S RATES ARE DOING, WHAT JAPANESE RATES ARE\nDOING FOR MOST OF 2016, DRAGGED OUR RATES ALONG WITH.\nI THINK ALL OF THE CENTRAL BANKING POLICIES THAT MADE THOSE\nMOVES AND ULTIMATELY CREATED A LOT OF DEUTSCHE BANK LANDSCAPE\nSCENARIOS WHERE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS CAN'T REALLY TURN A\nPROFIT, YOU NEED POSITIVE INTEREST RATES, I THINK ALL OF\nTHAT HAS FINALLY STARTED TO INFECT THE PSYCHE OF INVESTORS.\nIF CENTRAL BANKERS HAVE DONE THEIR BEST THE LAST SEVEN YEARS,\nI THINK INVESTORS UNDERSTAND THAT.\nI DON'T THINK THEY WANT TO BE RUNNING IN THAT PARADE ANYMORE.\nI THINK THIS WILL CONTINUE IN JGBs TO SOME EXTENT, IT WILL\nCONTINUE IN THE EUROPEAN SOVEREIGNS AND IN U.S. ISSUES.\nI THINK THAT MANY TRADERS NEED TO TRY TO LOOK AT THE\nFUNDAMENTALS IN A BIT OF A DIFFERENT WAY.\nBELIEVE ME, 2014, PARTS OF 2015, HAVE PERFORMED MUCH BETTER IN\nMANY ECONOMIC WAYS THAN 2016. SO I DON'T THINK IT'S COMPLETELY\nABLE TO BE TIED TO THE STRENGTH IN THE ECONOMY.\n>> ALL RIGHT. RICK, THANK YOU.\nRICK SANTELLI FROM CHICAGO.",

SHE TALKED NOT JUST ABOUT HER\nVISION FOR GROWING MIDDLE CLASS JOBS, BUILDING OUR ECONOMY FROM\nTHE MIDDLE OUT, HOW TO MAKE US SAFER AND STRONGER AROUND THE\nWORLD, HOW TO PROVIDE FOR STRONGER SCHOOLS AND BETTER\nCHILD CARE. SHE LAUNCHED A NEW ANTI-BULLYING\nINITIATIVE. THAT REMINDS ALL OF US THAT FOR\nDECADES HER FOCUS HAS BEEN ON CHILDREN AND FAMILIES AND\nBRINGING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER. IN CONTRAST TO HER OPPONENT WHO\nIS LITERALLY DELIVERING A DAILY LESSON IN HOW TO BE A BULLY IN\nTHE WAY HE'S CONDUCTING HIS CAMPAIGN AND HAS CONDUCTED\nHIMSELF IN DEBATES WITH SECRETARY CLINTON.\n>> IF SHE IS NOT WORRIED, WHY IS SHE BRINGING FIRST LADY MICHELLE\nOBAMA OUT THERE TO NORTH CAROLINA, THE VICE PRESIDENT.\nSHE HAS A BENCH OF HIGH-PROFILE SUPPORTERS HELPING HER TRY TO\nCLOSE THE DEAL. >> THAT'S RIGHT, WOLF.\nI WAS OUT HERE TODAY CAMPAIGNING IN WILMINGTON, NORTH CAROLINA,\nFAYETTEVILLE. JOE BIDEN, BARACK OBAMA,\nMICHELLE OBAMA ARE TREMENDOUS SURROGATES WITH GREAT FOLLOWING\nNATIONALLY. MANY SENATORS AND GOVERNORS ARE\nOUT IN THE FIELD AS WELL BECAUSE THERE ARE A FEW STATES LIKE\nNORTH CAROLINA WHERE THERE IS EARLY VOTING ALREADY UNDER WAY\nAND WHERE CONTROL OF THE STATE, THE PREDICTION FOR THE\nPRESIDENTIAL AND SENATORIAL AND GUBERNATORIAL RACES HERE HAVE\nGONE BACK AND FORTH. SO MANY OF US HAVE GONE TO OTHER\nPLACES IN THE COUNTRY WHO KNOW SECRETARY CLINTON, WHO HAVE\nSERVED AND WORKED WITH HER AND WHO CAN SPEAK TO HER STRENGTH.\nI WAS AT POLLING PLACES AND AT GRASS-ROOTS CAMPAIGN\nHEADQUARTERS IN SEVERAL PLACES ACROSS NORTH CAROLINA TODAY AND\nWAS GLAD TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER A POSITIVE MESSAGE.\nTHERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, WOLF, WHO HAVE BEEN\nTURNED OFF BY THE NASTY AND PERSONAL TONE OF THIS CAMPAIGN\nAND DEBATE NATIONALLY. MANY ARE CONCERNED THAT FOLKS\nWHO WOULD COME OUT AND VOTE FOR SECRETARY CLINTON OR FOR\nDEMOCRATS LIKE DEBORAH ROSS WHO IS RUNNING FOR THE SENATE HERE\nIN NORTH CAROLINA, MIGHT BE TURNED OFF AND STAY HOME.\nWE NEED FOLKS TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE, EVEN IN THE FACE\nOF ATTEMPTS TO SUPPRESS VOTING RIGHTS HERE IN NORTH CAROLINA\nAND AROUND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY, WE NEED FOLKS TO COME\nOUT AND VOTE. IT'S SOMETHING FOR WHICH SO MANY\nAMERICANS AND FOUGHT AND DIED OVER THE LAST YEARS.\nI THINK IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE IN\nTHIS PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. >> SHE DOES HAVE A PROBLEM,\nTHOUGH, WITH THE E-MAIL THAT WERE STOLEN -- RELEASED BY\nWIKILEAKS, THE JOHN PODESTA E-MAILS.\nSOME OF THEM VERY, VERY EMBARRASSING FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON, FOR THE CAMPAIGN, IF YOU WILL, INVOLVING CLINTON\nINITIATIVE -- THE GLOBAL INITIATIVE, INVOLVING HER\nHUSBAND'S BUSINESS. IS IT FURTHER HURTING VOTERS'\nTRUST IN HER AND THE CLINTON NAME?\n>> I DON'T THINK IT IS, WOLF, AT LEAST NOT FROM THE FOLKS I HAVE\nVISITED WITH AND HEARD FROM TODAY.\nIN THE SUMMARY OF THESE NEWEST RELEASES THAT I HEARD JUST IN\nTHE RUNUP TO THIS INTERVIEW I HEARD NOTHING NEW.\nI HEARD A SUMMARY OF BACK-AND-FORTH OF CAMPAIGN AIDES\nEXPRESSING WORRY OR ANXIETY. WHAT I KNOW IS THAT THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION, COMPARED TO THE TRUMP FOUNDATION, HAS MADE A\nREAL AND LASTING DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE\nAROUND THE WORLD. AND I THINK, AT THE END OF THE\nDAY, WHEN AMERICANS LOOK AT THE CHOICE BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND\nHILLARY CLINTON, THEY SEE A BIG DIVIDE ON MUCH BIGGER ISSUES\nTHAN SOME E-MAILS. >> ONE THING WAS THE OUTRAGE, WE\nDID LEARN FROM SOME OF HER CLOSEST ASSOCIATES AND MOST\nRELIABLE ASSOCIATES WHEN THEY DISCOVERED SHE WAS USING A\nPRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER WHILE SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE.\nNEERA TANDEN AMONG OTHERS. PODESTA HIMSELF WERE ALL STUNNED\nTO HEAR THAT THE SECRETARY WAS USING A PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER.\nTHAT'S A PROBLEM. >> WELL, WOLF, I THINK AMERICANS\nARE NOW WELL AWARE THAT SECRETARY CLINTON WAS USING A\nPRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER. SHE SAT THROUGH A VERY, VERY\nLONG HEARING IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN CHAIRED\nCOMMITTEE EARLIER THIS YEAR. I THINK IT WAS SEVEN HOURS LONG.\n>> THAT WAS ON THE BENGHAZI -- THAT WAS ON THE BENGHAZI ISSUE.\n>> THAT'S RIGHT. FORGIVE ME.\nBUT WHAT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT, FRANKLY, WOLF, IS THE NEWS TODAY\nTHAT HOUSE REPUBLICANS INTEND TO TRY AND CONVENE MANY, MANY MORE\nHEARINGS IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS TO COME AND THAT SENATOR CRUZ OF\nTEXAS SUGGESTS THAT HE MIGHT NEVER ALLOW AN UP OR DOWN VOTE\nON A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE NOMINEE FROM PRESIDENT CLINTON\nSHOULD SHE BE ELECTED. I DO THINK THAT THE DEGREE OF\nINVESTIGATION AND OVERSIGHT AND ALARM OVER THIS ISSUE EXCEEDS\nTHE UNDERLYING SEVERITY AND S SINCERITY OF THE ISSUE.\nTO HARKEN BACK TO THE BENGHAZI HEARINGS, I THINK THERE WERE\nMORE THAN 12 HEARINGS INTO A SIMPLE AND TRAGIC AND DIFFICULT\nINCIDENT IN LIBYA. IF WE HAVE REPUBLICANS ALREADY\nGEARING UP TO INVESTIGATE SECRETARY CLINTON IF SHE BECOMES\nPRESIDENT, ALREADY DEMANDING THAT THEY'LL CONTINUE TO STALL\nANY CONSIDERATION OF A NOMINEE FOR THE SUPREME COURT WE HAVE TO\nLOOK AT THE DAUNTING PROSPECT THAT THE REPUBLICANS WILL NOT\nALLOW HILLARY CLINTON TO GOVERN. >> IS IT REALISTIC THAT THEY\nMIGHT NEVER ALLOW A VOTE ON A SUPREME COURT NOMINEE, LET'S SAY\nHILLARY CLINTON'S NAME THAT SHE PUTS FORWARD.\nIS THAT REALISTIC? WOULD ENOUGH REPUBLICANS GO\nALONG WITH SENATOR CRUZ AND PREVENT CONSIDERATION OF A\nSUPREME COURT JUSTICE? >> WOLF, I HOPE THAT'S NOT\nREALISTIC OR CREDIBLE. >> DO YOU THINK IT IS?\n>> SENATOR CRUZ IS THE ONE WHO LED THE SHUTDOWN OF THE FEDERAL\nGOVERNMENT. >> DO YOU THINK IT IS REALISTIC\nOR CREDIBLE? >> I THINK THERE ARE SOME\nREPUBLICAN SENATORS WHO WILL TRY TO CONTINUE THEIR SORT OF\nUNILATERAL FILIBUSTER IN THE HUNDRED YEARS, WOLF, THAT WE\nHAVE HAD A SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WE HAVE NEVER HAD A\nNOMINEE WHO HAS FAILED TO GET A HEARING, FAILED TO GET A VOTE\nFOR AS LONG AS MERRICK GARLAND WHO WAS NOMINATED MANY MONTHS\nAGO BY PRESIDENT OBAMA. IT'S MY HOPE THAT THERE WILL BE\nENOUGH REPUBLICAN SENATORS WHO SEE THE IMPORTANCE OF A\nBIPARTISAN PROCESS TO CONFIRM A JUDICIAL NOMINEE FOR THIS\nVACANCY IN THE SUPREME COURT THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO MOVE\nFORWARD AND THAT SENATOR CRUZ, AS HAS BEEN THE CASE BEFORE, IS\nREALLY SPEAKING FOR A VERY SMALL AND EXTREME MINORITY OF THE\nREPUBLICAN CAUCUS IN THE SENATE. >> SENATOR, PLEASE STAND BY.\nWE'LL CONTINUE THE QUESTIONS AND THE ANSWERS, INCLUDING NEW\nSUGGESTIONS NOW FROM DONALD TRUMP.\nHE IS BEGINNING TO QUESTION THE VALIDITY OF THE VOTING IN THE\nSTATE OF TEXAS. MUCH MORE RIGHT AFTER THIS.",

BACK WITH DEMOCRATIC SENATOR\nCHRIS COONS OF DELAWARE, AS A HILLARY CLINTON SUPPORTER.\nSENATOR, DONALD TRUMP WAS TWEETING TODAY QUESTIONING THE\nVALIDITY, PERHAPS, OF THE VOTING IN TEXAS.\nTHIS IS WHAT HE TWEETED. I'LL PUT IT ON THE SCREEN.\nA LOT OF CALL-INS ABOUT VOTE FLIPPING AT THE VOTING BOOTHS IN\nTEXAS. PEOPLE ARE NOT HAPPY.\nBIG LINES. WHAT IS GOING ON?\nTHE SUGGESTION IS, APPARENTLY, LOCAL AUTHORITIES SAY THEY'RE\nVOTING ON ELECTRONIC TABLETS AND THERE COULD BE SOME PROBLEMS\nRIGHT NOW. HUMAN ERROR.\nTHEY DON'T THINK IT'S VERY SIGNIFICANT BUT DO YOU THINK\nHE'LL CONCEDE THIS ELECTION IF HE LOSES?\n>> WELL, WOCLF, I HOPE THAT DONALD TRUMP WILL OBSERVE\nDECADES, CENTURIES OF RESPECTFUL TRANSITION OF POWER OF THOSE WHO\nLOSE ELECTIONS, CONGRATULATING THEIR OPPONENTS AND ACCEPTING\nTHE RESULT, IF THAT'S THE RESULT.\nTHAT'S ONE OF THE HALLMARKS OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY.\nTO BE CLEAR, IN 2000, IN FLORIDA, THE OUTCOME WAS SO\nTIGHT, SO CLOSE, THAT AN AUTOMATIC RECOUNT WAS CALLED\nFOR. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT DONALD TRUMP\nSUGGESTED IN HIS ANSWER TO THE QUESTION IN THE THIRD DEBATE,\n\"WILL YOU RESPECT THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION?\"\nHE SAID, \"I'M GOING TO KEEP YOU IN SUSPENSE.\"\nTHE LATEST TWEET YOU QUOTED IS A SUGGESTION THAT TRUMP IS\nCONTINUING HIS THEME OF QUESTIONING WHETHER OR NOT THE\nVOTE WILL BE LEGITIMATE AND OF CALLING ON HIS VOTERS TO COME\nAND SUPERVISE POLLING PLACES. I THINK THIS IS A VERY DARK AND\nCONCERNING DEVELOPMENT, AND I REALLY HOPE THAT DONALD TRUMP\nWILL STOP UNDERMINING OUR DEMOCRACY AND QUESTIONING THE\nVALIDITY OF ELECTIONS, WHICH ARE RUN AT THE STATE AND LOCAL\nLEVEL, IN MANY CASES BY LOCAL REPUBLICAN ELECTED OFFICIALS\nCHAIRING STATE AND COUNTY ELECTION BOARDS.\n>> TODAY PRESIDENT PUTIN ENGAGED ON THE U.S. ELECTION SAYING HE\nDOESN'T SERIOUSLY THINK RUSSIA CAN INFLUENCE THE CHOICE OF THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE. WHY IS HE INTENTIONALLY\nDOWN-PLAYING -- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP --\nDOWNPLAYING RUSSIA'S INFLUENCE POTENTIALLY?\nRIGHT NOW PUTIN IS DOWN-PLAYING IT AS WELL?\n>> WELL, IT SEEMS TO ME STRIKING THAT WE HAVE HAD THE LEADERSHIP\nOF AMERICA'S NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY CONFIRM\nTHAT A RUSSIAN-CONNECTED SOURCE, THAT RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE LIKELY\nPLAYED A CENTRAL ROLE IN HACKS INTO DEMOCRATIC PARTY E-MAILS,\nINTO HACKS IN SECRETARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN E-MAILS, AND\nTHAT THERE WAS VERY CLOSE RELATIONS BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP'S\nPREVIOUS CAMPAIGN MANAGER AND PUTIN'S SUPPORTED LEADER OF THE\nUKRAINE. TODAY PUTIN IS SAYING, NO, NO, I\nHAVE HAD VERY LITTLE INFLUENCE ON THIS ELECTION.\nMY HUNCH IS BECAUSE MANY AMERICANS ARE CONCERNED BY THIS\nAND MANY AMERICANS SEE PUTIN INTENTIONALLY INFLUENCING THE\nELECTIONS AS A CONCERNING DEVELOPMENT.\nCERTAINLY FOR REPUBLICANS AND FOR NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNED\nINDEPENDENTS, THE IDEA THAT DONALD TRUMP, THE REPUBLICAN\nNOMINEE, WOULD SPEAK KINDLY AND POSITIVELY ABOUT PUTIN,\nPARTICULARLY IN CONTRAST TO OUR CURRENT PRESIDENT, IS A PRETTY\nSTRIKING AND WORRISOME DEVELOPMENT.\n>> SENATOR COONS, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.\n>> THANK YOU, WOLF.",

EACH OF YOU COULD SWING -- IN\nTHIS STADIUM, LET'S THINK ABOUT  EACH OF YOU COULD SWING AN\nENTIRE PRECINCT AND WIN THIS ELECTION FOR HILLARY JUST BY\nGETTING YOUR FRIEND, YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY HOW THE TO VOTE.\n>> CHRIS JANSING JOINS US NOW FROM THE SITE OF THAT RALLY IN WINSTON-SALEM, THE HOME OF WAKE\nFOREST UNIVERSITY. CHRIS, THE STAKES IN NORTH\nCAROLINA. IF TRUMP CAN'T WIN THAT STATE,\nHE CAN'T BE PRESIDENT. IF REPUBLICANS CAN'T WIN THE\nSENATE RACE THERE, THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO CONTROL\nTHE SENATE. WHAT ARE YOU HEARING FROM THE\nDEMOCRATS ABOUT THEIR PLANS THERE?\n>> Reporter: YEAH, DON'T THE DEMOCRATS KNOW IT?\nI'VE BEEN TALKING TO PEOPLE FROM THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN, I TALKED\nTO THE HEAD OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HERE.\nTHIS IS AN ALL OUT GET OUT THE VOTE PUSH.\nYOU'RE SEEING JUST THE LAST COUPLE OF BUSES BUT THERE WERE\nDOZENS OF THEM HERE PACKED WITH PEOPLE WHO WERE INSIDE.\nYOU HEARD THAT MESSAGE FROM THE FIRST LADY.\nSHE IS SO EFFECTIVE AT THAT, AND BEFORE SHE TALKED ABOUT THE 17\nVOTES WHEN BARACK OBAMA WON IN -- LOST IN 2012 IS, SHE\nTALKED ABOUT WHEN HE WON IN 2008 BY JUST A LITTLE MORE THAN TWO\nVOTES PER PRECINCT. WHEN SHE SAID THAT, PEOPLE WHO\nWERE AROUND ME UP IN THE AUDIENCE LITERALLY GASPED.\nSO HER MESSAGE, THE MESSAGE FROM HILLARY CLINTON WAS VOTE THIS\nAFTERNOON. IF YOU'VE ALREADY VOTED, GET\nYOUR FRIENDS, YOUR NEIGHBORS TO GET OUT AND VOTE, AND THEY MADE\nA CASE FOR WHY IT MATTERS. AND SO WHAT THEY'RE HOPING IS\nTHAT PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THOSE BUSES HEARD IT LOUD AND CLEAR,\nBECAUSE THEY DO BELIEVE WITH A RACE THIS CLOSE FOR PRESIDENT, A\nRACE THIS CLOSE FOR GOVERNOR AND FOR SENATE ALL IN NORTH\nCAROLINA, THEY'VE GOT THIS TRIFECTA GOING, THEIR EFFORTS\nARE GOING TO BE THE DIFFERENCE HERE.\nNOW, OF COURSE, THEY WOKE UP LIKE THE REST OF THE COUNTRY DID\nTO THOSE HEADLINES ON BOTH THE \"WASHINGTON POST\" AND THE \"NEW\nYORK TIMES\" ABOUT QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE FORMER\nPRESIDENT BILL CLINTON ENRICHED HIMSELF FROM THE WIKILEAKS\nREVELATIONS THROUGH THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, SO I HAD A CHANCE TO\nTALK TO JIM PALMERI WHO IS THE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR OF THE\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN. HERE IS A LITTLE PART OF THAT\nCONVERSATION. >> I THINK THAT WITHIN THE PRESS\nCORPS IN PARTICULAR THERE IS A LOT OF INTEREST IN\nBEHIND-THE-SCENES STAFF INTRIGUE.\nSO WE UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT WE DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS SOMETHING\nVOTERS WILL FOCUS ON OR CARE ABOUT.\n>> IT DOESN'T PLAY INTO THE NARRATIVE OF THEM ENRICHING\nTHEMSELVES, PLAYING BY A DIFFERENT SET OF RULES?\n>> VOTERS ARE LOOKING BACK AT THIS ELECTION ABOUT WHAT IT'S\nREALLY ABOUT, WHICH IS IT'S AN EXISTENTIAL QUESTION ABOUT WHAT\nKIND OF COUNTRY WE WANT TO BE. >> Reporter: SO CERTAINLY AMONG\nTHE FAITHFUL, AT LEAST THE FOLKS THAT ARE HERE, BECAUSE I TALKED\nTO A LOT OF FOLKS IN LINE THIS MORNING.\nTHEY SAY STOP WITH TALKING ABOUT THE E-MAILS ALREADY, BUT IN MANY\nWAYS THAT'S PREACHING TO THE CHORUS.\nI THINK THE OTHER THING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT HERE IS SEEING\nTHE SYNERGY OF MESSAGE BETWEEN THE FIRST LADY AND BETWEEN\nHILLARY CLINTON. THEY TALKED A LOT ABOUT\nCHILDREN, HOW MUCH THIS ELECTION MATTERS TO CHILDREN.\nTHEY TALKED VERY MUCH TO THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN AUDIENCE HERE\nABOUT VOTING RIGHTS. THERE HAVE BEEN DISPUTES HERE,\nTHERE HAVE BEEN COURT CASES THIS YEAR ABOUT EARLY VOTING.\nSO THEY REALLY HAD A VERY HONED-IN, TARGETED MESSAGE TO\nTHIS AUDIENCE AGAIN, BECAUSE AS YOU POINTED OUT, STEVE, THEY\nKNOW HOW IMPORTANT NORTH CAROLINA HAS BECOME IN THIS\nELECTION CYCLE. >> ALL RIGHT, CHRIS JANSING DOWN\nTHERE IN WINSTON-SALEM, NORTH CAROLINA.\nCHRIS, THANKS FOR THAT. AGAIN, THAT QUESTION, NORTH\nCAROLINA. HILLARY CLINTON COULD BASICALLY\nSHUT THIS WHOLE THING DOWN IF SHE CAN WIN NORTH CAROLINA, AND\nGUESS WHAT, AS CHRIS WAS TELLING YOU, THE ELECTION IS ALREADY\nSTARTED THERE. PEOPLE ARE ALREADY VOTING.\nTHIS IS A HEAVY EARLY VOTING STATE.\nLET ME SHOW YOU WHAT INFORMATION WE HAVE FROM NORTH CAROLINA.\nSO SO FAR MORE THAN 600,000 VOTES HAVE BEEN CAST.\nWHAT DOES THAT MEAN? THAT IS ABOUT 15% OF THE TOTAL\nOF ALL OF THE VOTES THAT WERE CAST IN 2012.\nTHIS IS A STATE WHERE ABOUT HALF OF ALL THE VOTES IN 2012 END UP\nBEING CAST EARLY. WHAT DO YOU SEE HERE?\nTHERE IS A BIG ADVANTAGE FOR DEMOCRATS IN TERMS OF THE\nBALLOTS THAT HAVE BEEN CAST SO FAR.\nTHEY ARE COMING MUCH MORE THAN FROM REPUBLICANS AND FROM\nINDEPENDENTS. I GIVE YOU A COUPLE NOTES OF\nCAUTION HERE. OBVIOUS THIS WILL LOOKS LIKE A\nSIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nREMEMBER, WE SAW A BIG ADVANTAGE IN THE EARLY VOTING IN NORTH\nCAROLINA IN 2012 FOR BARACK OBAMA AND THE DEMOCRATS.\nREMEMBER, IN THE END, MITT ROMNEY DID END UP WINNING THAT STATE BY TWO POINTS.\nWHEN YOU SEE AN IMBALANCE LIKE THIS, WHEN YOU SEE ALL THE\nMUSCLE THAT DEMOCRATS ARE PUTTING INTO THE EARLY VOTE,\nDOES IT MEAN THEY ARE FINDING NEW PEOPLE WHO OTHERWISE\nWOULDN'T VOTE ON ELECTION DAY AND GETTING THEIR VOTES BANKED\nRIGHT NOW, OR DOES IT MEAN MORE THAT THEY'RE JUST TAKING PEOPLE\nWHO ARE DEFINITELY GOING TO VOTE ON ELECTION DAY AND GETTING THEM\nTO VOTE EARLY? ARE THEY GENERATING NEW VOTES OR\nARE THEY JUST CHANGING THE TIME FRAME IN WHICH PEOPLE VOTE?\nAS EARLY VOTING BECOMES A BIGGER AND BIGGER PART OF OUR NATIONAL\nELECTIONS, THAT'S ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT'S SORT OF OPEN\nOUT THERE. AGAIN, THESE ARE THE NUMBERS WE\nHAVE. SO FAR, NORTH CAROLINA A HEAVY\nEARLY VOTING STATE. TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THAT RACE\nIN NORTH CAROLINA NOW. SOMEONE WHO KNOWS THE STATE'S\nPOLITICS BETTER THAN ANYONE, JIM MOORE, EDITOR OF THE POLITICAL\nOBSERVER IN CHARLOTTE. LET ME ASK YOU THE BOTTOM LINE\nQUESTION HERE. DONALD TRUMP HAS TO WIN NORTH\nCAROLINA OR HIS CHANCE OF BEING PRESIDENT DISAPPEARS ON THE\nSPOT. WE SHOWED THE AVERAGE OF ALL\nPOLLS. IT HAS HIM DOWN A COUPLE POINTS\nAGAINST HILLARY CLINTON. REALISTICALLY, WHAT POSITION IS\nDONALD TRUMP IN IN NORTH CAROLINA RIGHT NOW?\n>> WELL, STEVE, I THINK IT'S STILL A VERY CLOSE RACE.\nTHERE WAS ANOTHER POLL THAT CAME OUT TODAY THAT SHOWED CLINTON UP\nBY FOUR POINTS. DESPITE ALL THAT, I THINK IT'S\nSTILL VERY CLOSE. THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN KIND OF A\nREPUBLICAN STATE. BARACK OBAMA WAS THE FIRST\nPRESIDENT IN 30 YEARS, I THINK, TO WIN THE STATE WHEN HE DID IT\nIN 2008. BUT IT'S VERY COMPETITIVE ALL\nTHE WAY AROUND, AND THE SENATE RACE, THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE AND\nTHE GOVERNOR'S RACE IS ALL VERY CLOSE.\n>> TALK ABOUT THAT SENATE RACE FOR A MOMENT IF YOU WOULD.\nTHE PERSONALITIES OF BURR AND ROSS MAY NOT BE KNOWN THAT MUCH,\nBUT IF BURR, THE REPUBLICAN INCUMBENT, GOES DOWN, THAT'S A\nPRETTY GOOD SIGN DEMOCRATS WILL GET THE SENATE.\nWHAT'S YOUR READ ON THAT ONE? >> YOU KNOW, THE LATEST POLLS\nI'VE SEEN SHOW BURR WITH A SLIGHT LEAD.\nAGAIN, ALL THESE RACES ARE CLOSE, BUT BURR HAS STAYED IN\nTHE LEAD PRETTY CONSISTENTLY WITH SOME BACK AND FORTH.\nI THINK IF SECRETARY CLINTON DOES WELL IN NORTH CAROLINA, AND\nLIKE YOU SAID, THERE IS A BIG PUSH TO GET OUT THE VOTE, A BIG\nPUSH FOR THE EARLY VOTE. DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO RING UP\nTHEIR NUMBERS IN THE EARLY VOTE, WHICH THEY'VE TRADITIONALLY WON\nIN NORTH CAROLINA, THEN THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR DEBRA ROSS.\n>> THAT SEEMS TO BE THE MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION, THIS EARLY VOTE\nFOR DEMOCRATS. DO YOU HAVE A SENSE IF THEY'RE\nGENERATING NEW VOTES WITH THE EMPHASIS ON THAT, OR IF THERE'S\nMORE MOVING PEOPLE WHO ARE DEFINITELY GOING TO VOTE ON\nELECTION DAY AND JUST GETTING THEM TO VOTE EARLIER?\n>> YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH.\nI THINK IT'S CERTAINLY SOME OF NEW REGISTRATION, BUT I THINK\nMORE THEY'RE PROBABLY IDENTIFYING WITH PEOPLE WHO THEY\nKNOW WOULD VOTE FOR SECRETARY CLINTON AND GETTING THOSE PEOPLE\nOUT. THEY'VE BEEN WORKING AT IT.\nTHEY HAVE MORE OF A GROUND GAME IN NORTH CAROLINA THAN THE\nREPUBLICANS DO. THEY'VE GOT OVER 30 OFFICES ON\nTHE GROUND. THEY'VE GOT A PRETTY BIG PAID\nSTAFF HERE, AND THE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT SLOW ON\nTHE UPTAKE ON THAT. >> JIM MOORE DOWN THERE IN NORTH\nCAROLINA. THE BIGGEST BATTLEGROUND GOING\nRIGHT NOW. THANK YOU FOR TAKING A FEW\nMINUTES.",

SOMEDAY.\n>> IS IT YOUR INTEREST FROM A FILM MAKER'S POINT OF VIEW?\n>> IT HAS BEEN DONE. IT IS VERY VISUAL AND A LOT OF\nDRAMA. >> SO THERE IS INFERNO TO TALK\nABOUT WHICH IS THE LATEST IN THE DAVINCI.\nDO WE CALL IT A SERIES? >> THESE ARE STAND ALONE MOVIES\nBUT THEY HAVE IN COMMON TOM HANKS PLAYING ROBERT LANGDEN AND\nTHIS THING THAT DAN BROWN DOES BRILLIANTLY WHICH IS CREATES\nSORT OF MULTIPLE WAYS OF ENTERTAINING HIS READERS.\nI TRY TO DO THE SAME THING WITH THE MOVIES WHICH IS TRANSPORT\nTHEM, CREATE GREAT MYSTERY. I USE THESE FANTASTIC CLUES SO\nTHERE IS A PUZZLE AND THE ROBERT LANGDEN CHARACTER AND THEN\nCONTROVERSIAL BUTTON PUSHING IDEA AT THE CENTER OF IT.\nINFERNO IS I THINK THE MOST MODERN AND EDGY SUBJECT MATTER\nWHEREAS THE OTHERS TENDED TO EXIST A LITTLE MORE IN THE PAST,\nRELIGION, HISTORY. THEY FACTORED INTO THE DRAMA A\nLITTLE MORE. THIS IS OF THE MOMENT.\nTHAT GAVE ME AS A DIRECTOR KIND OF THE DRIVE AND ENERGY TO DO\nSOMETHING VERY CONTEMPORARY. >> WE WERE JUST SAYING THAT THAT\nFORMULA SEEMS TO TRAVEL OVERSEAS.\nIT HAS BEEN DOING RELATIVELY WELL.\n>> THEY ALWAYS DO FAR BETTER OVERSEAS AND VERY INTERNATIONAL\nMOVIES. >> IS THAT MOSTLY CHINA?\nWHAT IS THE BREAK DOWN PRA MOVIE LIKE THIS?\n>> DA VINCI CODE WAS OPENED AND PULLED AND WAS MYSTERIOUS AS TO\nWHY IT WAS PULLED WHETHER IT WAS CONTROVERSIAL AS IT RELATED TO\nTHE CHURCH OR IT WAS A COMPETITION ISSUE.\nWE NEVER REALLY KNEW BUT THIS ONE WAS ACCEPTED AND WE ARE\nTHRILLED AND IT OPENS TOMORROW, AS WELL.\nWE WILL BE WATCHING CHINA TO SEE.\n>> SO THE GLOBAL BOX OFFICE IS STILL IMPORTANT IN MARKETS LIKE\nEUROPE AND UK AND AUSTRALIA. >> ABSOLUTELY.\nMORE THAN EVER AND A MOVIE LIKE THIS SPEAKS TO A BROAD AUDIENCE\nBUT AMERICAN FILM MAKERS ARE TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO MAKE\nTHEIR AMERICAN STORIES MORE RELATABLE AND SORT OF LESS\nNARROW IN THEIR SCOPE. >> WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE WATCHING AT\nHOME? THAT VENTURE WITH SEAN PARKER\nAND WE ASKED HIM ABOUT IT EARLIER.\nIN THIS DAY AND AGE PEOPLE LOVE WATCHING AT HOME.\nWHY NOT BRING NEW MOVIES? >> EVERY FILM MAKER WOULD PREFER\nFOR AUDIENCES TO SEE IT AS SINGLE SITTING UP ON A BIG\nSCREEN WITH GREAT SOUND. THAT IS WHAT YOU ALWAYS HOPE\nFOR. SPEAK FRG MYSELF I WATCH STUFF\nON MY iPHONE. I WATCH THINGS AT HOME.\nI MAKE THOSE KINDS OF DECISIONS. SO WHEN THIS OPPORTUNITY CAME\nALONG I FEEL THERE IS INEVITABILITY TODAY AND DATE\nDISTRIBUTION. I DON'T LOVE IT.\nWHAT I KIND OF LOVE ABOUT SEAN PARKER'S IDEA IS THAT IT'S\nLIMITED. THERE IS REVENUE SHARE WITH THE\nTHEATER OWNERS. I THINK THAT IT EVENTIZES\nMOVIES. ANYTHING THAT REFRESHES\nAUDIENCE'S SENSIBILITY THAT THERE ARE GREAT TV SERIES BUT\nTHERE IS STILL SOMETHING GREAT ABOUT THE MOVIE THAT UNFOLDS IN\nA COUPLE OF HOURS AND YOU HAVE THE COMPLETE EXPERIENCE.\nI THINK IF YOU DO IT AT HOME AND GET EXCITED ABOUT THE FORMAT YOU\nARE LIKELY TO SEE IT IN A GREAT THEATER, I MAX OR SOMETHING.\n>> IS IT HARD TO LIVE UP TO WHEN YOU DO A MOVIE BASED ON A BOOK?\nIS THERE MORE PRESSURE TO GET IT TO REFLECT WHAT THE BOOK'S\nMESSAGE IS? >> EVERY MOVIE IS NOTHING BUT\nPRESSURE. IT IS.\nTHEY ALL HAVE STRENGTHS AND POTENTIAL LAND MINES AND POT\nHOLES IN TERMS OF NARRATIVE. YOU DO TEST SCREENINGS TO SEE\nHOW IT GOES AND TRY TO LISTEN AND LEARN.\nBOOKS ARE A CHALLENGE BUT IT IS ALSO DOUBLE EDGED SWORD BECAUSE\nIT IS A HUGE ADVANTAGE WHEN SO MANY PEOPLE KNOW A DAN BROWN\nTITLE AND YET MY JOB IS TO MAKE IT A MOVIE MOVIE.\nAND DAN BROWN IS THE FIRST ONE TO UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE THESE\nBOOKS ARE BIG AND SPRAWLING. HE KNOWS WHAT A CHALLENGE IT CAN\nBE. HE IS VERY, VERY COOPERATIVE AND\nSUPPORTIVE. HE IS AN EXECUTIVE PRODUCER ON\nTHE PROJECT. MY GOAL IS PRESERVE THE SPIRIT,\nTHE BIG IDEAS THAT I LOVE AND THAT OUR CREATIVE GROUP LOVES\nAND READERS LOVE AND THEN MAKE IT SOMETHING FOR THE AUDIENCES.\nTHIS IS A MOVIE THRILLER. IT'S NOT ABOUT JUST YOU DON'T\nHAVE TO HAVE READ THE BOOK. >> IT ALSO SEEMS IT WAS A MODERN\nMOVIE MAYBE IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE.\nWHAT WAS IT LIKE WORKING WITH DRONES?\n>> THAT WAS MY FIRST UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH\nDRONES. THAT WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE\nSEQUENCES FROM THE BOOK. I WANTED TO TRY TO GET THAT\nRIGHT. ONCE WE EDITED THAT TOGETHER AND\nAUDIENCES STARTED TELLING ME HOW MUCH THEY LIKED IT IT MADE ME\nFEEL GOOD. DAN BROWN IS EXCITED ABOUT THE\nDRONE ACTION SCENE. >> YOU ARE PROBABLY FIGURING\nTHAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE READ THE BOOK TO SEE THE MOVIE.  WHO\nPROBABLY ENVISION TOM HANKS IN THE PART.\n>> HE LOVES PLAYING THE CHARACTER.\nI NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD REPEAT A CHARACTER, LET ALONE DO ANYTHING\nYOU COULD EVEN CHARACTERIZE AS A SEQUEL.\nBUT EACH OF THESE HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT CINEMATIC JOURNEYS.\nTHEY'RE GREAT LIFE EXPERIENCES. LET'S FACE IT, YOU DEVOTE A YEAR\nOF YOUR LIFE TO A PROJECT. IT'S GREAT TO GO TO FLORENCE AND\nSHOOT, AND TOM LOVES IT AS WELL. >> WHAT'S THE BIGGEST MONEY\nMISTAKE THAT YOU'VE MADE? >> THE BIGGEST MONEY MISTAKE\nTHAT I MADE WAS SORT OF BELIEVING IN THE IDEA OF THE\nSORT OF LONG CHURN, HAND IT OVER TO A MONEY MANAGER.\n>> THAT WAS A MISTAKE? >> A MISTAKE, YEAH.\nWE FOUND THAT IT WAS KIND OF, YOU KNOW, UNFORTUNATELY, AND\nMAYBE IT'S THE ADVISE THAT'S WE CHOSE, BUT KIND OF A ZERO SUM\nGAME, MORE OR LESS. >> WOW.\nSO WHAT DO YOU DO NOW? YOU'RE LOOKING AROUND AT THE TICKERS?\n>> MY WIFE IS KIND OF GOING TO CASH.\n>> IS SHE CALLING THE SHOTS ON YOUR PORTFOLIO?\n>> SHE PAYS ATTENTION, SHE REALLY DOES.\nI'VE FOUND OVER THE YEARS THAT THE BEST THING THAT I CAN DO IS\nWORK FOR A LIVING. AND I'VE GOT A GREAT JOB AND A\nGREAT CAREER. WE INVEST VERY, VERY\nCONSERVATIVELY. >> LAST QUESTION, WHAT'S THE\nNEXT QUESTION, THEN? >> SEVERAL DIFFERENT THINGS,\nTHROUGH IMAGINE ENTERTAINMENT, MY PARTNER AND I ARE WORKING ON\nA NUMBER OF THINGS. WE HAVE THE TV SERIES \"EMPIRE,\"\nWHICH IS ON GOING. A NEW VERSION OF \"24.\"\nWE ALSO HAVE A MINI SERIES ON NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC NEXT MONTH\nCALLED \"MARS.\" IT'S A HALF DOCUMENTARY AND HALF\nSCRIPTED. IT'S ABOUT GOING TO AND\nCOLONIZING MARS. I DON'T THINK YOU'VE EVER SEEN\nANYTHING ON TELEVISION LIKE THIS.\nAND I STILL HAVE THE BEATLES DOCUMENTARY THAT CAN BE SEEN ON\nHULU. >> AND ALSO HAS A THEATRICAL\nRUN? >> IT'S IN THEATERS.\nI WOULD LIKE TO SAY IT'S A TESTAMENT TO MY FILMMAKING, BUT\nIT'S A TESTAMENT TO THE FAB FOUR.\n>> THANK YOU FOR MAKING TIME,",

STAYING WITH POLITICS.\nDONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON HAVE SPARRED OVER WHO IS MORE\nEQUIPPED TO HAVE CONTROL OVER THE THOUSANDS OF WARHEADS IN THE\nU.S. NUCLEAR ARSENAL. NOW A NEW PRO-CLINTON SUPER PAC\nIS TAKING DIRECT AIM AT DONALD TRUMP'S JUDGMENT.\nHIS TEMPERAMENT AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF.\nWITH THIS AD, WHICH IS AIRING IN BATTLEGROUND STATE OHIO.\n>>. [ BOMBS ]\n>> ONE NUCLEAR BOMB CAN KILL A MILLION PEOPLE.\nTHAT'S MORE THAN ALL THE MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN LIVING IN\nCOLUMBUS, OHIO. >> THEY'RE HEARING A GUY RUNNING\nFOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TALKING OF MAYBE USING\nNUCLEAR WEAPONS. NOBODY WANTS TO HEAR THAT ABOUT\nAMERICA'S PRESIDENT. >> WHY ARE WE MAKING THEM?\n>> JOINING ME NOW IS THE MAN WHOSE SUPER PAC IS BEHIND THAT\nAD. NONE OTHER THAN FORMER NEW\nJERSEY SENATOR AND ONE-TIME DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATE BILL BRADLEY. SENATOR BRADLEY, THANK YOU SO\nMUCH FOR BEING HERE. NICE TO HAVE YOU.\n>> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU, JAKE. >> SENATOR, LET ME JUST START\nOFF WITH, I MEAN, THIS IS -- THIS AD IS EVOKING COMPARISONS\nTO THE INFAMOUS DAISY AD RELEASED BY LYNDON JOHNSON'S\nCAMPAIGN IN 1964. IT ONLY AIRED ONCE, AS YOU KNOW.\nYOUNG GIRL IN A FIELD COUNTING FLOWER PETALS.\nCUTS TO A NUCLEAR CLOUD. INCREDIBLY CONTROVERSIAL.\nBUT IT'S CREDITED WITH HELPING TO WIN LYNDON JOHNSON\nRE-ELECTION. DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT IT'S\nFAIR TO SAY DONALD TRUMP MIGHT START A NUCLEAR WAR?\n>> I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES WHO DO WE TRUST WITH\nOUR LIFE WHEN WE ARE LOOKING AT A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.\nAND PERSONALLY, I THINK THAT HE DOESN'T HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OR\nTHE ABILITY TO DEFUSE A CRISIS DIPLOMATICALLY BEFORE IT REACHES\nTHE NUCLEAR LEVEL. I MEAN, JOHN KENNEDY WAS ABLE TO\nDO THAT 50 YEARS AGO IN THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS.\nDONALD TRUMP IS NOT JOHN KENNEDY.\nTHEN THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH HIS PERSONALITY.\nIT'S ERRATIC, IT'S UNDISCIPLINED.\nHE LASHES OUT. I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE KIND OF\nPERSONALITY THAT WE WANT TO HAVE IN CHARGE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN\nTHIS COUNTRY. I MEAN, THEN THERE IS THE\nQUESTION OF HIS FOCUS. YOU SAW ALL OF THE DEBATES.\nI MEAN, HE FOCUSES 40 MINUTES, MAYBE AN HOUR, MAYBE 50 MINUTES.\nHE DIDN'T EVEN FOCUS AN HOUR AND A HALF.\nWHEN YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND YOU ARE A\nNUCLEAR POWER, YOU HAVE TO BE ON FOCUS 24/7, NOT SOMETIMES.\n>> RIGHT. BUT THIS ISN'T THE THEORETICAL\nARGUMENT. YOU ARE SUGGESTING IN THIS AD\nTHAT YOU THINK HE COULD ACTUALLY CAUSE A NUCLEAR DISASTER, RIGHT?\nI MEAN, THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK. >> I AM SAYING THAT HIS\nPERSONALITY AND HIS ABSENCE OF EXPERIENCE AND HIS ABILITY LEADS\nTO THE POTENTIAL FOR MISCALCULATION, MISREADING THE\nINTENT OF THE ENEMY, AND WITHOUT -- AND NOT HAVING THE\nLEADERSHIP SKILLS TO DEFUSE A CRISIS.\n>> LET ME ASK YOU, BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP HAS SAID THAT\nHILLARY CLINTON MIGHT CAUSE WORLD WAR III, SUGGESTING THAT\nTHAT WOULD BE WITH THE RUSSIANS. YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO HAS SAID\nTHAT WE SHOULD BE TRYING BETTER AS A NATION, OR LEADERS SHOULD\nBE, TO REPAIR OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA.\nDO YOU STILL FEEL THAT WAY, ESPECIALLY GIVEN ALL THAT'S\nTRANSPIRED WITH THE WIKILEAKS AND THE INFORMATION THAT IS\nCOMING FROM SYRIA IN TERMS OF RUSSIA'S PARTICIPATION IN THE\nBOMBARDMENT OF CIVILIANS THERE? >> YES.\nI THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE A DIALOGUE TO TRY TO GET AGREEMENT\nIN AREAS PARTICULARLY RELATED TO NUCLEAR WEAPONS WHERE WE CAN.\nI THINK, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE RUSSIAN INVOLVEMENT IN OUR\nDEMOCRATIC ELECTION PROCESS IS, IN MY VIEW, OUTRAGEOUS, AND I\nTHINK THAT WE SIMPLY HAVE TO REJECT THAT.\nAND CLEARLY, THERE IS ONE BENEFICIARY OF THAT.\nWITH ALL THE WIKILEAKS COMING. AND I THINK THAT THAT WILL\nBACKFIRE. AND I THINK ULTIMATELY PEOPLE\nARE GOING TO SAY, WE WANT TO DEFEND OUR DEMOCRACY.\nTHE REALITY IS THAT DONALD TRUMP IS TAKING POSITIONS AGAINST OUR\nDEMOCRACY. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE\nTHING WITH PUTTING HILLARY CLINTON IN JAIL, NOT ABIDING BY\nTHE RESULTS. AND TODAY YOU SAW A GROUP OF\nTRUMP SUPPORTERS SAYING REVOLUTION TO PREVENT HER FROM\nBEING INAUGURATED. I MEAN, JAKE, WE ALL SAID THE\nPLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE TO THE FLAG, AND IT ENDS WITH WITH\nLIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. YOU'RE PLEDGING ALLEGIANCE TO\nAMERICAN DEMOCRACY. BUT DONALD TRUMP IS ATTACKING\nAMERICAN DEMOCRACY. I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT -- IT CAN BE REPUBLICANS,\nDEMOCRATS, INDEPENDENTS, IT'S NOT JUST DEMOCRATS, WHO CAN SEE\nTHE DANGER OF A DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENCY, WHO UNDERSTAND THE\nSTRENGTH OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY, AND KNOW THAT WE CAN IMPROVE IT\nBUT IT NEEDS TO BE DEFENDED, NOT ATTACKED.\n>> FORMER SENATOR AND FAMOUS NEW YORK KNICK DOLLAR BILL BRADLEY.\nGREAT TO SEE YOU.",

THAT'S WHAT WE CALL STORIES WE\nDON'T THINK ARE GETTING ENOUGH ATTENTION.\nPLANS FOR A PIPELINE IN NORTH DAKOTA HAVE BEEN MET WITH\nPASSIONATE PROTEST. TENSIONS ARE MOUNTING.\nHOURS AGO POLICE IN ARMORED VEHICLES AND RIOT GEAR MOVED IN\nMAKING TWO DOZEN ARRESTS. DEMONSTRATORS ARE SAID HAVE TO\nTRESPASSED ON PRIVATE PROPERTY. THE SIOUX TRIBE IS CALLING FOR\nTHE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO INVESTIGATE CLAIMS OF LAW\nENFORCEMENT ABUSE. ALL THIS OVER A $3.7 BILLION OIL\nPIPELINE THAT CROSSES FOUR STATES BUT WOULD CROSS THROUGH\nWHAT THE TRIBE CLAIMS IS SACRED NATIVE AMERICAN LAND.\nTHE DEVELOPER SAYS THE PROJECT WOULD BE AN ECONOMIC BOOM.\n7.4 BILLION BARRELS OF OIL. PROTESTERS SAY THE CONSTRUCTION\nPROJECT WOULD DESTROY BURIAL GROUNDS AND POTENTIALLY DISRUPT\nTHEIR WATER SUPPLY. JOINING ME NOW ONE OF THE\nPROTESTERS, ACTOR AND ACTIVIST MARK RUFFALO.\nTHANK YOU FOR JOINING US. YOU SPENT THREE DAYS AT THE\nPROTEST SITE THIS WEEK DEMONSTRATING ON BEHALF OF THE\nSTANDING ROCK SIOUX TRIBE. WHAT MOTIVATED YOU TO JOIN THE\nPROTEST? >> I MADE RELATIONSHIPS WITH\nTHESE PEOPLE DURING THE CLIMATE MARCH HERE IN NEW YORK.\n500,000 PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD GATHERED TO STOP CLIMATE\nCHANGE. AND I ALSO GOT TO KNOW SOME OF\nTHEM WHILE WE WERE MAKING \"FIGHTING AGAINST HYDRO\nFRACKING\" HERE IN NEW YORK STATE.\nULTIMATELY, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF THE WORK I DO HAS TO DO WITH\nPROTECTING WATER, AND THAT'S WHAT THESE PEOPLE ARE DOING\nTHERE. AND SO I WAS INVITED BY SOME OF\nTHE FOLKS I KNEW THERE TO DELIVER A SOLAR SYSTEM TO POWER\nTHE CAMP FOR THE WINTERTIME, WAHALA JOHNS IS A NAVAJO LEADER\nWHO BUILT THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND ASKED ME TO JOIN HER WHEN WE\nWENT TO DELIVER IT. >> INTERESTING.\nSO THE SIOUX AND OTHER PROTESTERS ARE SAYING THAT THE\nLAW ENFORCEMENT HAVE BEEN VIOLENT.\nHAVE YOU WITNESSED ANY VIOLENCE AGAINST THE PROTESTERS?\n>> I DIDN'T WITNESS ANY VIOLENCE WHILE I WAS THERE.\nBUT I WITNESSED AND HEARD THE STORIES FROM THE YOUNG PEOPLE\nWHO HAD WITNESSED AND FELT THE VIOLENCE.\nI MET A GIRL WHO HAD HER ARM BROKEN A FEW DAYS AGO.\nMANY OF THE PROTESTERS HAD HAD ENCOUNTERS WITH THE POLICE IN\nTHEIR ARRESTS WHERE THEY WERE THROWN INTO JAIL CELLS NAKED,\nTHEY WERE STRIP-SEARCHED. WE HAD AN ENCOUNTER WITH THE\nPOLICE YESTERDAY. WE WENT TO ONE OF THE ROAD\nBLOCKS JUST TO SAY HELLO AND GET A SENSE OF THE FEELING THERE.\nAND THE FEELING THAT THE POLICE WERE SORT OF EMANATING.\nAND IT WAS DEFINITELY -- THERE WAS TWO POLICE OFFICERS WITH\nAR-15s WITH THEIR FINGERS RIGHT NEXT TO THE TRIGGER, WITH THE\nDARK SUNGLASSES ON. VERY, VERY AGGRESSIVE.\nNOW, I SPENT THE DAY ON THE CAMP, IN THE CAMP, THE FORWARD\nCAMP, THE ONE YOU ARE SEEING HERE, WHERE PEOPLE WERE ENGAGED\nIN PRAYER. EVERY SINGLE PERSON YOU SEE\nTHERE WAS TRAINED IN PEACEFUL RESISTANCE, WHICH MEANS THAT NO\nONE IS ALLOWED OUT IN THAT AREA UNLESS THEY'VE HAD SOME SORT OF\nPEACEFUL RESISTANCE TRAINING. THE MANTRA OF THE PLACE IS IT'S\nNOT THE POLICE, IT'S THE PIPELINE THAT WE'RE PROTESTING\nOR PROTECTING OURSELVES AGAINST. AND THEY SPEND BASICALLY THE\nENTIRE DAY DOING PRAYERS, CHANTING.\nI HAVE NEVER BEEN AROUND SO PEACEFUL A STAND.\nIT'S LED BY YOUNG PEOPLE. YOU CAN SEE IN THESE PHOTOS.\nTHE FIRST PEOPLE WHO BEGAN THIS WHOLE MOVEMENT WERE YOUNG PEOPLE\nFROM 10 YEARS OLD TO 17, 18 YEARS OLD.\nAND THE TRIBAL LEADERS ARE STILL TAKING THEIR LEAD FROM THEM.\n>> SO, LET ME JUST ASK YOU TO PLAY DEVIL'S ADVOCATE.\nTHE DEVELOPER SAYS IT IS PRIVATE LAND.\nTHEY WENT THROUGH THE PERMITTING PROCESS.\nTHE TRIBE SUED. THEY HAD ITS DAY IN COURT.\nTHEY LOST. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT?\n>> WHAT WE'VE SEEN REPEATEDLY HAPPEN TO THESE PEOPLE IS THEY\nHAVE MADE ONE TREATY IN 1851, 1861, AND EVER SINCE THEN THAT\nTREATY HAS BEEN VIOLATED. THAT LAND THAT THEY ARE TALKING\nABOUT, THAT EASEMENT, IS ACTUALLY TREATY LAND.\nTHAT IS OWNED BY THE NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE BASED ON THE\nSINGLE TREATY THEY MADE WITH THE UNITED STATES.\nTHAT TREATY SUPERSEDES ANY LAWS THAT THE STATE MIGHT MAKE LATER.\nAND SO TODAY OBAMA COULD LITERALLY -- COULD SAY THAT WE\nARE HONORING THE 1851 TREATY AND WE ARE NOT ALLOWING THAT\nEASEMENT TO BE TAKEN AS PRIVATE PROPERTY.\nTHAT'S BASICALLY AT THE CRUX OF THE ISSUE.\nTHAT EASEMENT THAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT AS PRIVATE\nPROPERTY, BASED ON THE 1851 TREATY, THE STANDING TREATY THAT\nTHESE PEOPLE MADE WITH THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT, IS INDIAN\nLAND, NATIVE AMERICAN LAND THAT BELONGS TO THE STANDING ROCK\nSIOUX RESERVATION, AND NATION. >> MARK RUFFALO, YOU GET\nINVOLVED IN A LOT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CAUSES, BUT HAVE\nYOU BEEN INVOLVED WITH NATIVE AMERICAN CAUSES BEFORE?\n>> YES. I STOOD SIDE BY SIDE WITH MY\nNATIVE BROTHERS AND SISTERS HERE WHEN WE WERE FIGHTING HYDRO\nFRACKING IN NEW YORK STATE. THE PIPELINE IS ABOUT TO MOVE\nTHROUGH NEW YORK STATE, AND WE'RE ALSO SETTING UP A CAMP\nJUST LIKE THIS ONE IN -- IN THE SIOUX COUNTRY.\nWHAT'S SIGNIFICANT THAT PEOPLE DON'T KNOW IS THAT THIS\nPARTICULAR ISSUE HAS BROUGHT TOGETHER 500 TRIBES FROM ALL\nOVER THE NATION. NEVER IN THE HISTORY OF OUR\nNATION HAVE ALL OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES COME TOGETHER\nUNDER ONE ISSUE. THEY SEE THIS AS A VERY SPECIAL,\nHISTORICAL MOMENT FOR THEM. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR\nTIME, MARK. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.\n>> LET ME TELL YOU, THERE ARE PEOPLE BEING REALLY HURT THERE.\nI HAVE BEEN ON THE PHONE ALL DAY WITH THEM.\nIT'S VERY SCARY. THESE PEOPLE ARE JUST LIKE US.\nWE CAN'T FORGET OUR HUMANITY IN THE FACE OF THESE KINDS OF\nTHINGS. YOU HAVE A CORPORATION AND A\nSTATE WHO IS WORKING ON BEHALF OF A CORPORATION TO HURT OUR\nPEOPLE. THEY'RE MILITARIZED.\nTHE NATIONAL GUARD HAS BEEN CALLED IN.\nI MEAN, THIS IS NOT AN EMERGENCY.\nTHIS IS NOT A NATIONAL EMERGENCY.\nTHESE ARE PEACEFUL PROTESTERS. THE STATE DEPARTMENT, THE\nDEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR, THE D.O.J., AND PRESIDENT OBAMA\nHIMSELF HAVE ASKED THEM TO VOLUNTARILY HALT ANY\nCONSTRUCTION UNTIL THIS CAN BE WORKED OUT IN A PEACEFUL MANNER.\nTHE GOVERNOR OF -- GOVERNOR DAL R\nOF NORTH DAKOTA. IF THERE IS BLOOD ON ANYONE'S\nHANDS, IT'S ON HIS HANDS. >> MARK RUFFALO, THANK YOU SO\nMUCH.",

I ACTUALLY DIDN'T KNOW WE HAD\nCOME OFF OF THE TARMAC UNTIL GOVERNOR PENCE CAME BACK AND\nCHECKED ON US, BECAUSE IT WAS DARK OUTSIDE AND IT WAS BAD\nWEATHER. WE COULD NOT SEE WHAT WAS GOING\nON BUT THANK GOODNESS WE DID NOT RUN INTO THE HIGHWAY.\n>> GOVERNOR PENCE DID COME TO THE BACK OF THE PLANE TO SEE IF\nEVERYONE WAS ALL RIGHT? >> HE DID.\nAS SOON AS THE PLANE CAME TO A COMPLETE HALT AFTER 20 OR 30\nSECONDS, SECRET SERVICE IMMEDIATELY SPRUNG UP AND\nCHECKED ON HIM.

BUT A SCARY MOMENT.\nTHE PLANE SKIDDED OFF THE RUNWAY.\nAN ALARM WAS PUT OUT. AS YOU CAN SEE, EMERGENCY\nPERSONNEL EVACUATING THE PLANE AS BOTH THE CAMPAIGN STAFF THAT\nTRAVEL WITH INDIANA GOVERNOR MIKE PENCE, AS WELL AS THE\nTRAVELING PRESS THAT COVERS HIM, INCLUDING SOME OF OUR OWN, WERE\nON THAT PLANE WHEN IT HIT THE RUNWAY AND APPARENTLY SKIDDED\nOFF IN THE RAIN. WE ARE NOW AWAITING, HOPEFULLY,\nSOME MORE WORD, BUT AS OF NOW, IT SOUNDS LIKE EVERYONE WAS FINE\nAND BELIEVED THERE WERE NO ACTUAL INJURIES DURING THAT\nEVENT. WE'RE HOPING TO GET A\nCONFIRMATION OF THAT. WE DO HAVE CONFIRMATION, AT\nLEAST EARLY CONFIRMATION, THAT NO ONE WAS HURT IN ANY SEVERE\nWAY. I DO NOT KNOW IF WE HAVE MADE\nCONTACT WITH THE GOVERNOR, HIMSELF.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE, MIKE PENCE.\nOBVIOUSLY A LITTLE BIT OF A CHAOTIC SCENE ON THEaGUARDIA OND\nAND STORMY NIGHT IN NEW YORK CITY.\nJEB STARLING, THE CONGRESSMAN FROM TEXAS, APPARENTLY TRAVELING\nON THAT PLANE ON THE HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE.\nWE BELIEVE THAT EVERYTHING IS FINE AND WE'RE GOING TO GET AND\nALL-CLEAR AND NBC PRODUCER VAUGHN HILLIARD WHO WAS ON THE\nPLANE IS WITH US. VAUGHN, WHAT HAPPENED?\n>> I'M WITH THE CAMPAIGN. >> JOHN, WHAT HAPPENED?\n>> HEY THERE. AM I LIVE, GUYS?\n>> YOU'RE LIVE. YOU'RE LIVE, BUDDY.\n>> OKAY. WE'RE ON THE TARMAC HERE AT\nLaGUARDIA. THE PLANE HAD A TOUGH LANDING.\nTHIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME THIS PLANE'S HAD A TOUGH LANDING.\nTHE FLIGHT WAS ACTUALLY DELAYED BY ABOUT TWO HOURS WHEN THE\nPLANE LANDED, WE WERE GOING THROUGH THE -- GOING THROUGH THE\nCLOUDS, HIT THE GROUND, AND AND WE STARTED TO SKID.\nYOU FELT SKIDDING. THE PLANE STARTED TO SWERVE TO\nTHE RIGHT AND THERE WAS SOME BUMPING THEN THE PLANE STOPPED.\nAS I SAID, THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME.\nTHIS IS THE TENTH CAMPAIGN PLANE, HE'S BEEN FLYING ON THIS\nPLANE FOR THREE-PLUS MONTH, SUSPECT THE FIRST TIME THE PLANE\nHAS HAD A ROUGHER LANDING. IT'S BECOME SORT OF A JOKE, GET\nREADY FOR THE LANDING. BUT OBVIOUSLY THE CONDITIONS\nWERE A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT HERE IN NEW YORK CITY TONIGHT.\nAND WE'RE GOING TO ZOOM IN, THAT IS KAREN PENCE, THAT I BELIEVE\nYOU'LL BE SEEING. I THINK WE'RE ON A LITTLE BIT OF\nA DELAY. THAT IS KAREN PENCE GETTING OFF\nTHE PLANE THERE. BUT THE PLANE SWERVED OFF AND WE\nNEED TO -- OKAY. WE NEED A SHOT OF THE GOVERNOR.\nSO WE'RE BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM THE SCENE HERE.\nYOU'RE GOING TO SEE THE GOVERNOR HERE IN A FEW MOMENTS.\nWE'RE BEING LED AWAY, BUT THE PLANE SLID OFF.\nEVERYBODY GOT UP. THERE WAS NO -- TO BE CLEAR,\nEVERYTHING FLEW AROUND AND FLEW FORWARD, BUT THE SITUATION WAS\nNOT IN WHICH ANYBODY WAS BEING THROWN AROUND.\nTHE GOVERNOR GOT UP QUICKLY AND HE WALKED -- AND HE WALKED BACK\nTO THE BACK OF THE PLANE. ACTUALLY WAS MAKING SURE THAT\nEVERYBODY WAS OKAY. AND EVEN KIND OF GAVE SOME FIST\nPUMPS IN THE AIR JUST AS EVERYBODY'S OKAY, EVERYBODY'S\nSAFE. HE'S MAKING SURE THAT EVERYBODY\nWAS OKAY. WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY REALIZE THAT\nWE WERE TOTALLY OFF OF THE RUNWAY WHEN THIS HAPPENED.\nBUT IT WASN'T UNTIL WE STARTED TO SEE THE LIGHTS, THE\nAMBULANCE -- OR THE FIRE TRUCKS ALL OUT THERE.\nYOU CAN SEE THE RESPONSE. WE'RE JUST KIND OF GOING WITH\nTHIS AT THIS POINT, YOU GUYS. >> YEAH.\n>> BUT THE GOVERNOR WAS OKAY. KAREN PENCE IS ON THE PLANE,\nKAREN PENCE THE FIRST LADY OF INDIANA, CHARLOTTE PENCE, THEIR\nOLDEST DAUGHTER WHO TRAVELS FREQUENTLY WITH THE CAMPAIGN.\nCAMPAIGN STAFF, THE SECRET SERVICE WHO TAKES UP TEN ROWS\nAND ABOUT EIGHT MEMBERS OF THE PRESS AND THEN THEY BROUGHT UP\nTHE STAIRS AND OBVIOUSLY WE JUST GOT OFF -- I THINK WE SAW\nEARLIER WHEN THE FEED STARTED COMING IN, YOU SAW MUD STREAKS\nAND WE ARE -- WE'RE BEING -- WE'RE -- SORRY.\nWE'RE BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM THE SCENE HERE.\n>> VAUGHN, IT'S BASICALLY -- CAN YOU TELL ME, OBVIOUSLY THE\nGOVERNOR AND HIS WIFE AND THEIR DAUGHTER, THEM, STAFF AND PRESS,\nIS THAT BASICALLY WHO'S ON THAT PLANE?\n>> YEP, THAT'S WHO'S ON THE PENCE PLANE.\nHE HAD A STOP -- HE WAS COMING FROM FT. DODGE, IOWA, LANDING\nFOR A FUND-RAISER WHICH WE'LL SEE WHETHER THAT HAPPENS.\nTHAT WAS GOING TO BE AT TRUMP TOWER THIS EVENING.\nTHE TRUMP, ACTUALLY, WE SENT VIDEO EARLIER OF THE GOVERNOR\nPLAYING FOOTBALL ON THE TARMAC BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER\nCONDITIONS. I'LL LET YOU HANDLE WHAT THE\nACTUAL WEATHER, WHAT THE SITUATION WAS, BUT WE ARE ABLE\nTO SEE HERE, I'M GOING TO GO OVER HERE TO THE RIGHT AND YOU\nCAN SEE HOW CLOSE WE ARE, AGAIN, I THINK THERE ARE VIDEOS ON\n20-SECOND DELAY HERE. BUT YOU'LL SEE HOW CLOSE TO THE\nROAD WE ARE OVER HERE ON THE RIGHT SIDE.\nAND LITERALLY INSIDE OF THE GRASS --\n>> WOW. >> I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS ARE\nSEEING THAT NOW. >> YEAH, WE CAN.\n>> AND YOU SEE ACTUALLY, I'M GOING TO ZOOM IN HERE TO WHERE\nTHE FENCE IS. YOU DON'T -- IT'S ACTUALLY\nPRETTY REMARKABLE. NOW, WE'RE JUST COMING TO GRIPS\nWITH KIND OF LOOKING AT THIS. HOW CLOSE WE WERE TO -- HOW\nCLOSE WE WERE TO THE ROAD. >> THAT PLANE IS PRETTY FAR OFF\nTHAT RUNWAY. >> YEAH.\nIT'S IN THE GRASS THERE WHICH I GUESS THE IMPACT OF THE PLANE\nCREATED MUD WHICH IS THE MUD MARKS THAT WE ARE ABLE TO SEE\nWHEN WE FIRST GOT OFF OF THE PLANE THERE, BUT EVERYBODY --\nI'M PRETTY SURE I'VE STILL GOT -- I STILL HAVE BAGS UP ON\nTHE PLANE. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT CAME AND\nSAID, PLEASE, EVERYBODY, JUST GET OFF THE PLANE NOW.\nWE WERE TRYING TO ESTABLISH A SHOT HERE.\nAGAIN, WE DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE HONESTLY WHAT HAPPENED RIGHT\nWHEN IT HAPPENED, BUT THE GOVERNOR GOT UP IMMEDIATELY,\nMADE SURE SECRET SERVICE, MADE SURE THE PRESS WAS OKAY.\nI THINK WE GOT THE SHOT. WE SEE HIM BACK OVER HERE.\nSORRY. IT'S A -- I MAY EVEN HAVE SOME\nRAINDROPS. >> VAUGHN, WHERE WERE YOU GUYS\nCOMING IN FROM? >> WE WERE COME IN FROM FT.\nDODGE, IOWA, WHERE WE HAD A CAMPAIGN EVENT.\nWE HAD A ABOUT TWO, THREE-HOUR FLIGHT.\nSO WE'VE BEEN IN THE AIR FOR A LITTLE WHILE.\nWE KNEW THE STORM WAS IN HERE. IT WAS DELAYED FOR THE\nFUND-RAISER, WAS SUPPOSED TO START EARLIER THIS EVENING IN\nNEW YORK CITY. >> WERE THERE ANNOUNCEMENTS\nMADE, OBVIOUSLY YOU GUYS HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS HAPPENING, FELT\nTHE IMPACT, DIDN'T QUITE REALIZE THE SKID.\nDID ANYONE SAY ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING AS IT\nHAPPENED? >> ABSOLUTELY.\nAND, YOU KNOW, I'LL BE HONEST, I HAD MY PHONE OUT AND WAS\nRECORDING A FELLOW REPORTER WAS SLEEPING, AND BECAUSE IT'S NOT\nUNNORMAL TO HAVE THESE HARD IMPACTS, WE WERE RECORDING.\n. I LITERALLY TURNED IT OFF\nBECAUSE I THOUGHT WE WERE FINE. THEN SUDDENLY WE SLID OFF.\nBUT EVERYTHING, PHONES, WATER BOTTLES, ABOUT TWO SECONDS AFTER\nTHE LANDING, SUDDENLY EVERYTHING JUST SHOT FORWARD.\nMY SEAT BELT WASN'T FULLY TIGHTENED AND I FLEW FORWARD AND\nWAS OBVIOUSLY CAUGHT BY THE SEAT BELT, BUT",

MIKE PENCE LATER REPORTED\nSEEING MUD ON THE WINDOWS NEAR THE FRONT OF THE PLANE\nAND ONE OF FOX NEWS CHANNEL'S PRODUCER DAN\nGALLOW WAS ACTUALLY ON BOARD THAT PLANE AND HE DESCRIBES\nIT AS THE FOLLOWING. HE SAYS, QUOTE:  WE HAVE\nSLID OFF THE RUNWAY AT LAGUARDIA.\nIT WAS THE CRAZIEST LANDING I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED.\nHE GOES ON TO SAY WE SEEM TO BE SLIDING FOR THE DISTANCE\nOF THE LANDING AND THEN A BURNING SMELL BECAME OBVIOUS\nLIKE RUBBER. PENCE THEN CAME BACK TO MAKE\nSURE EVERYONE WAS OKAY. NOBODY IS INJURED.\nPENCE SAID, AGAIN, THAT HE SAW MUD ON THE WINDOWS AT\nTHE FRONT OF THE PLANE AND THEY ARE WAITING AT THE TIME\nFOR EMERGENCY PERSONNEL TO ARRIVE AT THE PLANE.\nAGAIN, WE ARE TRYING TO GET DAN GALLOW ON THE PHONE.\nAS FAR AS WE KNOW, THEY ARE ALL STILL ON BOARD THAT\nPLANE, MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE IS OKAY.\nAGAIN, AS FAR AS WE KNOW, THERE ARE NO INJURIES.\nMIKE PENCE HAS BEEN TRAVELING FOR THE CAMPAIGN\nON A 737. WE ALL KNOW THOSE SOUTHWEST\nAIRLINES FLIES NOTHING BUT 737S.\nA LOT OF OTHER AIRLINES AS WELL.\nTHIS ONE CONFIGURED DIFFERENTLY THOUGH TO BRING\nMEDIA ALONG. KEEP IN MIND, THAT IT IS\nRAINING IN LAGUARDIA TONIGHT.\nAND THE PLANE APPARENTLY DID SLIDE AS IT WAS LANDING.\nMIKE PENCE WAS DOING CAMPAIGN RALLIES TODAY IN\nTHE BATTLEGROUND STATE OF OHIO.\nTHERE WERE NO INJURIES. EMERGENCY PERSONNEL WILL GO\nTO THE PLANE, MAKE SURE EVERYBODY'S OKAY.\nYOU CAN SEE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OR THE LEFT-HAND\nSIDE OF YOUR SCREEN WHAT APPEARS TO BE STEPS COMING\nOUT. AND, AGAIN, IT'S OUR\nUNDERSTANDING THAT IF THEY HAVE GOTTEN OFF THE PLANE,\nIT WAS ONLY MOMENTS AGO. WE ARE WORKING THE BREAKING\nNEWS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO BRING\nYOU UPDATES ON THIS AS THEY COME IN.\nWE NOW HAVE -- OKAY, WE HAD DAN GALLOW ON THE PHONE.\nWE ARE TRYING TO GET HIM BACK.\nAS SOON AS WE GET HIM BACK, WE'LL BRING THAT TO YOU.\nA LITTLE BIT MORE COMING IN TO US NOW AT THE BREAKING\nNEWS DESK, DAN GALLOW IS ON THE PHONE.\nDAN IS A LOS ANGELES PRODUCER WHO HAS BEEN\nCOVERING THE CAMPAIGN FOR MIKE PENCE.\nDANIEL, IF YOU CAN, I READ THE STATEMENT YOU GAVE US.\nGIVE ME AN IDEA OF WHAT HAPPENED AS YOU WERE COMING\nIN FOR A LANDING. >> WELL, TRACE.\nFIRST OFF I WOULD SAY THIS PLANE HAS KIND OF BEEN KNOWN\nFOR ITS ROUGH LANDINGS. AND I HAVE -- PEOPLE HAVE\nJOKED THAT MAYBE IT WAS A NAVY PILOT AND I THINK NAVY\nPILOTS ARE MAYBE KNOWN FOR LANDING ON CARRIERS THAT ARE\nLITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE\nOR NOT. THAT'S BEEN THE JOKE.\nBECAUSE WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF ROUGH LANDINGS OR FELT LIKE\nWE LANDED MORE THAN ONCE IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.\nSO TONIGHT WHEN WE HIT THE GROUND, IT FELT LIKE -- WE\nJUST WEREN'T SLOWING DOWN. LIKE THE BRAKES WERE REALLY\nJAMMED ON THE WHOLE TIME, THE WHOLE DISTANCE OF THE\nRUNWAY. AND YOU KNOW, YOU COULDN'T\nREALLY SEE OUTSIDE. SO YOU COULDN'T REALLY SEE\nHOW FAST WE WERE GOING OR WHERE WE WERE.\nIN FACT, WHEN WE FINALLY CAME TO A STOP, I COULDN'T\nTELL IF WE WERE ON THE GRASS OR ON THE RUNWAY.\nBUT WE STAYED PUT FOR A GOOD LONG WHILE.\nAND IT KIND OF BECAME OBVIOUS THAT SOMETHING WAS\nASKEW. THE SMELL OF BURNT RUBBER\nWAS VERY OBVIOUS. I WOULD SAY AT SOME POINT AS\nWE WERE LANDING. AND THAT KIND OF TIPPED US\nOFF THAT SOMETHING WASN'T RIGHT.\nAFTER I GUESS MAYBE 2 MINUTES, GOVERNOR PENCE CAME\nBACK AND CHECKED ON ALL OF THE REPORTERS IN THE BACK OF\nTHE PLANE. HE SEEMED TO BE FINE.\nHE SAID HE SAW MUD ON THE FRONT WINDOWS OF THE PLANE.\nAND THAT'S THE FIRST POINT I REALIZED THAT I GUESS WE ARE\nIN THE GRASS AND NOT THE RUNWAY.\n>> YEAH. IT'S AMAZING, DANIEL, AS YOU\nLOOK AT THESE PICTURES, WE ARE LOOKING AT LIVE PICTURES\nNOW OF THE 737 THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ON NOW FOR SEVEN\nMONTHS. I'M CURIOUS, GIVE US AN\nIDEA, DAN, WHEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER FLOWN ON A PRESS\nPLANE BEFORE IT'S NOT EXACTLY THE SAME SETUP.\nYOU DON'T HAVE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS.\nWAS THERE ANYBODY AS YOU CAME IN ON WHAT YOU APPEAR\nTO SAY WAS A HOT LANDING? WAS THERE ANYBODY GIG YOU\nINSTRUCTIONS ON WHAT TO DO OR WHAT WAS HAPPENING AS THE\nPLANE WAS KIND OF SLIDING DOWN THE RUNWAY?\n>> NO, TRACE. I HAVE GOT TO SAY EVERYONE\nTOOK IT ALL AS IT HAPPENS. THERE WASN'T ANYTHING -- YOU\nARE MOVING AT A REALLY FAST SPEED.\nI DON'T THINK THAT A FLIGHT ATTENDANT WOULD HAVE HAD\nTIME OR THE ABILITY TO REACH OVER.\nBECAUSE, YOU KNOW, FOR SEVERAL SECONDS OF\nUNCERTAINTY YOU ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S\nHAPPENING AND IT'S NOT A TIME WHEN PEOPLE ARE GOING\nTO GET OUT OF THEIR SEAT AND START YELLING INSTRUCTIONS\nAT PASSENGERS. THE PLANE BY ITSELF YOU\nMENTIONED A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE NOT BEEN IN PLANE LIKE\nTHIS. IT'S NOT UNLIKE 737 THAT YOU\nHAVE FLOWN. IN ALL KIND OF BUSINESS\nCLASS SEATING. THERE IS MORE SPACE AND\nEVERYTHING. LESS SEATS IN THE PLANE.\nBUT, YEAH, I CAN'T SAY THAT ANYBODY REALLY KNEW WHAT WAS\nHAPPENING UNTIL REALLY TENDED.\nMAYBE PEOPLE WHO KNOW MORE ABOUT FLYING THAN I DO.\nBUT IT WAS A HECK OF AN EXPERIENCE.\n>> AND, DANIEL, AND WHEN YOU SAY WHEN IT ENDED, HOW DID\nIT END? I MEAN, YOU SAY YOU ARE\nGOING DOWN THE RUNWAY AND THEN AT SOME POINT IT\nAPPEARS YOU WENT OFF THE RUNWAY AND HIT SOME MUD.\nSO WHAT WAS THE FEELING LIKE?\nWAS IT A SUDDEN JOLT TO A STOP?\nWAS IT KIND OF A SLOW STOP? WHAT DID IT FEEL LIKES A YOU\nCAME TO THE END OF THAT RUNWAY?\n>> I GUESS -- YOU KNOW, IT'S A LITTLE TOUGH TO REMEMBER\nEXACTLY EVERYTHING. BUT IT FELT LIKE IT WAS A\nPRETTY SUDDEN STOP ONCE WE FINALLY DID COME TO A STOP.\nI DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS WHEELS GETTING STUCK IN THE\nMUD. WE DIDN'T GO THAT FAR OFF OF\nTHE PAVEMENT FROM WHAT I COULD TELL ONCE WE GOT OFF\nTHE PLANE. IT DID APPEAR TO ME AND\nMAYBE YOU CAN SEE IT ON YOUR PICTURES BUT IT APPEARED TO\nME THAT SOME OF THE PAVEMENT WAS BROKEN UP ON THE ACTUAL\nRUNWAY. AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS\nAS A RESULT OF US OR IF THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN THERE.\nFRANKLY, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW THE TARMAC REAL WELL.\nI DON'T KNOW IF THIS WAS -- HOW FAR OFF WE WERE, I DON'T\nKNOW IF WE SLID 20 FEET OR 100 FEET TO BE HONEST WITH\nYOU. I JUST KNOW WE DIDN'T HIT\nTHE TARGET. >> YEAH.\nIT'S FASCINATING AS WE WATCH THESE LIVE PICTURES COMING\nOUT OF LAGUARDIA AIRPORT FROM OUR FOX AFFILIATE THERE\nWNYW, DAN GALLO, STAND BY. I WANT TO UPDATE PEOPLE WHO\nARE JOINING US HOPING TO SEE \"THE O'REILLY FACTOR.\"\nMIKE PENCE, THE G.O.P. NOMINEE HIS PLANE COMING IN\nFROM OHIO HAS SLID OFF THE RUNWAY IN LAGUARDIA.\nA 737. IT WAS COMING IN, AS 737S DO\nAPPROXIMATELY 120, 130 MILES PER HOUR, RAINING IN\nLAGUARDIA AND IT SLID OFF THE RUNWAY.\nDAN GALLO, A PRODUCER FOR FOX NEWS CHANNEL WAS ON\nBOARD THAT PLANE AND QUICKLY, DAN, WE DON'T HAVE\nMUCH TIME LEFT, GIVE ME AN IDEA OF HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE\nON BOARD THAT PLANE AND IF ANYBODY WAS SHAKEN UP, ABOUT\n15 SECONDS, DAN. >> YEAH, TRACE.\nEVERYBODY SEEMED TO BE FINE. EVERYBODY KIND OF SEEMED TO\nBE IN AWE OF WHAT WE HAD JUST GONE THROUGH.\nTHERE IS ROUGHLY MAYBE 40, 45 PEOPLE, INCLUDING SECRET\nSERVICE, CAMPAIGN STAFF, AND THE MEDIA ALONG WITH THE\nFLIGHT STAFF. >> ALL RIGHT.\nDAN GALLO, BACK TO YOU. LISTEN, BREAKING NEWS AS IT\nCOMES IN. WE'LL UPDATE YOU ON THE\nSTORY OUT OF LAGUARDIA AIRPORT.\nMIKE PENCE'S PLANE OFF THE RUNWAY.\n\"THE O'REILLY FACTOR\" NOW.

WELCOME TO \"THE KELLY FILE.\"\nI'M MEGYN KELLY. YOU'RE LOOKING AT BRAND-NEW\nPICTURES AT THE MOMENT THAT THE PLANE CARRYING THE VICE\nPRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE ON THE GOP TICKET SLID OFF THE RUN RAE AT\nNEW YORK'S LaGUARDIA AIRPORT ON A RAINY NIGHT IN MAN HAT.\nWE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE FOX NEWS PRODUCER ON BOARD THE\nPLANE. AS THIS HAPPENED HE SHOT THIS\nEXCLUSIVE VIDEO. FIRST TO TRACE GALLAGHER WHAT IS\nAT THE BREAKING NEWS DESK WITH WHAT WE KNOW.\n>> THE 737 WHICH TOUCHES DOWN AROUND 120 MILES AN HOUR, WAS\nCOMING IN KIND OF HOT. HE WAS ON BOARD THE PLANE AND\nTHEN HE SAYS IT BEGAN SKIDDING AND TO QUOTE HIM HE SAYS IT WAS\nTHE CRAZIEST LANDING HE'S EVER EXPERIENCE ND.\nHE SMELLING BURNING RUBBER BEFORE IT CAME TO REST IN THE\nGRASS AT THE END OF THE RUNWAY. MIKE PENCE CAME TO THE BACK OF\nTHE PLANE TO SEE THAT EVERYONE ON BOARD WAS OKAY.\nTHE PLANES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT USE A COMBINATION OF BRAKES AND\nREVERSE THRUSTERS. BUT ONE OF THE REASONS YOU DON'T\nSEE 737s FLYING IN AND OUT OF LaGUARDIA IS BECAUSE THE RUNWAYS\nAREN'T THAT LONG. THIS RUNWAY IS 7,000 FEET.\nTHAT'S 3,000 FEET SHORTER THAN WHAT YOU WOULD FIND AT NEWARK OR\nJFK. AS A RULE, 737s ONLY NEED 4,000\nFEET. BUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT RAINY\nWEATHER LIKE THEY HAVE TONIGHT AT LaGUARDIA, THAT CHANGES THE\nMATH. IT'S THARD TO TELL WHEN YOU LOOK\nAT THE PICTURES WHICH ANGLE AND WHICH DIRECTION THE PLANE CAME\nIN. BUT ANYBODY WHO HAS FLOWN IN AND\nOUT OF LaGUARDIA KNOW THEY HAVE WATER AT THE END OF THE RUNWAYS.\nTHIS PLANE SLID ONLY AS FAR AS THE GRASS AND THE PASSENGERS\nSTAYED ON THE PLANE TEN MINUTES BEFORE RESCUE TEAMS ARRIVE.\nEVERYBODY WALKED OFF BOARD. THE GOVERNOR REPORTEDLY WAS\nTRAVELING WITH CAMPAIGN ADVISERS, THE MEDIA AS WELL AS\nHIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER. WE'RE TOLD THAT DONALD TRUMP DID\nREACH OUT TO MIKE PENCE AND SAYS THAT HE'S GLAD EVERYONE ON BOARD\nIS SAFE. THERE APPEARS -- IF YOU LOOK AT\nTHE PLANE, THERE APPEARS TO BE SOME DAMAGE TO THE RUNWAY BUT NO\nNOTICEABLE DAMAGE TO THE AIRPLANE ITSELF.\nBUT THIS PLANE IS NOT LEAVING FOR A WHILE, MEGYN.\n>> TRACE, THANK YOU. JOINING US FOR MORE IS DAN GALLO\nWHO WAS ON THE PLANE. WAS IT OBVIOUS WHEN THE PLANE\nWAS LANDING THAT YOU WERE IN TROUBLE?\n>> WELL, YOU KNOW, I MENTIONED TO SOME OWE PEOPLE TONIGHT WE'VE\nHAD SOME INTERESTING LANDINGS IN THIS PLANE.\nI CAN'T EXPLAIN WHY THEY'VE BEEN REALLY ROUGH LANDINGS.\nWE'VE KIND OF GOTTEN USED TO THAT.\nBUT THIS ONE FELT LIKE WE WERE BEING PULLED OFF TO THE SIDE.\nFRANKLY, A SENSATION THAT I'VE NEVER FELT BEFORE IN A LANDING.\nIT DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT. I DON'T KNOW AIRCRAFT THAT WELL.\nI JUST KNEW IT DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT BUT I COULDN'T SEE MUCH OUTSIDE\nOF THE WINDOW OF THE PLANE SO I COULDN'T TELL IF WE WERE IN THE\nGRASS, GOING SIDEWAYS ON THE RUNWAY OR WHATEVER.\nBUT IT FELT LIKE IT WAS PULLING TO ONE SIDE.\nAND THEN IT CAME TO A REALLY ABRUPT STOP AFTER IT FELT LIKE\nTHEY HAD BEEN JAMMING ON THE BRAKES FOR THE DURATION OF THE\nLANDING. >> AND LIKE ANY GOOD PRODUCER\nYOU TOOK OUR YOUR CELL PHONE AND STARTED FILMING THINGS ONCE\nTHINGS SETTLED DOWN. THERE'S CERTAINLY NO PANIC ON\nTHE FLIGHT. WHAT WAS THE FIRST YOU SAW OF\nGOVERNOR PENCE? >> I WOULD SAY A MINUTE OR TWO\nAFTER LANDING. HE WALKED BACK AND ASKED IF\nEVERYONE WAS OKAY. OF COURSE EVERYONE WAS FINE.\nWE WERE ALL WEARING OUR SEAT BELTS.\nIF WE HADN'T BEEN WEARING OUR SEAT BELTS, COULD HAVE BEEN A\nPROBLEM. ADDS HE WAS WAID\nGOVERNOR PENCE, 2016 BECAUSE IT FEELS LIKE THIS IS ALL -- YOU\nKNOW, EVERYTHING ELSE HAS HAPPENED IN 2016, WHY NOT THIS.\n>> WERE YOU -- DID YOU HAVE TO GO DOWN THE EMERGENCY SLIDE TO\nGET OUT? HOW DID YOU EXIT THE AIRCRAFT?\n>> NO, NO SLIDING. WE WAITED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES.\nWE COULD SEE THE EMERGENCY LIGHTS OUTSIDE THE WINDOW OF THE\nPLANE. COULDN'T SEE A WHOLE LOT BECAUSE\nTHE RAIN WAS FOGGING UP THE WINDOWS OF THE PLANE.\nBUT YEAH, WE WALKED DOWN THE STAIRS.\nSOMEHOW THEY GOT STAIRS AND WE WALKED DOWN WHERE THERE WAS\nMORNING PERSONNEL OUTSIDE THE PLANE.\n>> EVERYONE IS OKAY, INSCLUGD THE GOVERNOR, INCLUDING YOU.\nGLAD TO HEA IT. AS YOU SAY, DAN GALLO, 2016.\n>> I GOT SOME MUD ON MY SHOES AFTER TONIGHT.\n>> GREAT TO HEAR FROM YOU. GLAD TO HEAR EVERYONE IS ALL\nRIGHT.",

BRIANNA KEILAR, LET'S TALK ABOUT\nTHIS IMPORTANT JOINT EVENT TODAY, THE FIRST LADY OF THE\nUNITED STATES, HILLARY CLINTON -- MICHELLE OBAMA, SHE\nWAS SPEAKING MOSTLY POSITIVELY, SENDING A POSITIVE MESSAGE ABOUT\nHILLARY CLINTON. NEVER MENTIONED DONALD TRUMP'S\nNAME AT ALL, BUT DIDN'T REALLY GO AFTER HIM THAT MUCH.\nAN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY? >> THAT'S RIGHT.\nI THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO KEEP THINGS A LITTLE MORE POSITIVE.\nRIGHT AFTER THE \"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD\" TAPE CAME OUT,\nMICHELLE OBAMA WAS PERHAPS ONE OF -- I THINK SHE MIGHT HAVE\nBEEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE PERSON SPEAKING OUT AGAINST IT.\nA COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO IN NEW HAMPSHIRE SHE HAD THE STRONGEST\nOF WORDS FOR DONALD TRUMP. SHOCKING, DEMEANING, THAT HE WAS\nBELOW THE BASIC STANDARDS OF DECENCY.\nTODAY SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT DIVISIONS AND SAID\nTHAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS A DIFFERENT VISION THAT HAS MORE\nTO DO WITH TOGETHERNESS. BUT I THINK WHAT'S REALLY\nAMAZING ABOUT THIS APPEARANCE IS JUST THAT SHE IS THERE, SO\nWHOLEHEARTEDLY CAMPAIGNING FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nEIGHT YEARS AGO IF SOMEONE HAD TOLD YOU THAT THIS WOULD HAVE\nHAPPENED, ONE, THAT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN BESTIES UP THERE, SORT\nOF HUGGING IT OUT BEFORE, OR THAT MICHELLE OBAMA WOULD BE\nPROBABLY THE BEST SURROGATE OUT THERE, I MEAN, EIGHT YEARS AGO\nSHE HAD TO HAVE A WHOLE IMAGE REHAB BECAUSE SHE WAS SEEN AS\nDIVISIVE. NOW SHE IS NOT.\nSHE IS AN ADDITIVE. >> WHAT WAS ALSO INTERESTING,\nJACKIE, WAS THE FACT THAT THE FIRST LADY WAS INTRODUCED BY\nHILLARY CLINTON, USUALLY IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND.\n>> SHE WAS THE HEADLINER TODAY. IT'S BEEN INTERESTING TO SEE\nHILLARY CLINTON SORT OF ADOPT WHAT MICHELLE OBAMA HAS BEEN\nSAYING ON THE TRAIL, BE IT THE, THEY GO LOW, WE GO HIGH.\nYOU HEARD HILLARY CLINTON SAY SOME OF THE THINGS MICHELLE\nOBAMA SAID ABOUT -- IN EARLIER SPEECHES ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT\nAND THE TREATMENT OF WOMEN. SO SHE REALLY IS TRYING TO\nABSORB A LITTLE BIT OF THE CELEBRITY AND PANACHE THAT\nMICHELLE OBAMA BRINGS. >> MARK PRESTON, THE NEW\nQUINNIPIAC POLL POLLS. IN IOWA TIED 44-44.\nCLINTON AND TRUMP. IN GEORGIA OF ALL PLACES, TRUMP\n44, HILLARY CLINTON, 43. IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THAT WAY\nIN THOSE TWO STATES. HILLARY CLINTON WAS WAY BEHIND\nIN IOWA A MONTH AGO AND BEHIND IN GEORGIA, OF COURSE, AS WELL,\nIT'S A RED STATE. >> THE LAST TIME DEMOCRATS WON\nGEORGIA, WOLF, WAS BILL CLINTON IN 1992.\nIT GOT VERY, VERY RED. TEN YEARS FROM NOW IT WOULD SEEM\nTO MAKE SENSE BECAUSE OF DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES IN THAT\nSTATE AND IN OTHER STATES SUCH AS TEXAS.\nIT SHOWS YOU THAT TRUMP'S CANDIDACY, FOR ALL THAT HE IS\nATTRACTING, HE HAS ALSO PUSHED A LOT AWAY AT THE SAME TIME, THAT\nYOU ARE SEEING DEMOCRATS IN THAT STATE CONSOLIDATE.\nIN THE STATE OF IOWA, HILLARY CLINTON HAS NEVER DONE WELL\nTHERE. DIDN'T NECESSARILY DO WELL IN\nTHE CAUCUSES. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS TRUMP HAS\nDONE WELL, EVEN THOUGH HE LOST THE CAUCUSES THERE.\nYOU ARE SEEING A CONSOLIDATION OF SOCIAL CONSERVATIVES GETTING\nBEHIND TRUMP. THOSE NUMBERS RIGHT THERE, THE\nLAST TIME THAT REPUBLICANS WON IOWA, WAS IN 2004 WITH JOHN\nKERRY. BARACK OBAMA WON IT IN THE LAST\nTWO ELECTIONS. SO, IF HILLARY CLINTON COULD\nKNOCK OFF TRUMP IN GEORGIA AND IOWA, ELECTION OVER.\n>> DAVID AXELROD, ONLY MOMENTS AGO DONALD TRUMP SAID THIS IN\nTOLEDO. LET ME PLAY THE CLIP FOR YOU.\nLISTEN TO THIS. >> JUST THINKING TO MYSELF RIGHT\nNOW, WE SHOULD JUST CANCEL THE ELECTION AND JUST GIVE IT TO\nTRUMP, RIGHT? WHAT ARE WE HAVING IT?\n>> IT'S ALREADY GENERATING SOME BUZZ OUT THERE.\nYOU'RE SMILING WHEN YOU HEAR HIM SAY IT.\nHE THINKS HE'S DOING REALLY WELL.\n>> WELL, I THINK HE IS -- HE HAS EXPRESSED SOME CONCERN ABOUT HOW\nTHE ELECTION MIGHT COME OUT IF WE ACTUALLY HOLD ONE AND WHETHER\nHE'S GOING TO RECOGNIZE THE RESULT OF IT.\nSO I AM SURE HE WOULD PREFER A SITUATION WHERE WE COULD JUST BY\nACCLAMATION DECLARE THAT HE IS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nBUT THE NUMBERS ARE THE NUMBERS, AND THEY'RE PRETTY DAUNTING FOR\nHIM RIGHT NOW. THE DISCUSSION YOU JUST HAD WITH\nMARK SPEAKS TO IT. HE HAS SO ANTAGONIZED KEY\nCONSTITUENCIES IN SOME BATTLEGROUND STATES.\nIN MANY BATTLEGROUND STATES. COLLEGE-EDUCATED WOMEN,\nHISPANICS AND OTHER MINORITIES, YOUNGER VOTERS.\nTHAT HE HAS MADE IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIMSELF TO CLIMB\nTHIS HILL. >> MARK PRESTON, YOUR REACTION\nTO WHAT WE JUST HEARD FROM TRUMP?\nI SUSPECT HE WAS JUST TRYING TO BE FUNNY, CUTE AND SARCASTIC A\nLITTLE BIT OR WHATEVER. >> THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF\nTRUTH IN EVERYTHING DONALD TRUMP SAYS, THOUGH, AS IN WHAT EVERY\nPOLITICIAN SAYS. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY WHAT DONALD\nTRUMP SHOULDN'T BE DOING RIGHT NOW.\nWE TALKED BEFORE THE BREAK ABOUT STAYING ON MESSAGE.\nSAYING SOMETHING LIKE THAT JUST PLAYS TO THE CROWD, AND HE GETS\nENERGY OFF OF THAT, WOLF, BUT GUESS WHAT, IT DOESN'T REACH OUT\nTO ALL THE CONSTITUENCIES THAT DAVID JUST MENTIONED.\n>> STAY WITH US, EVERYBODY.",

AND WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING IS\nTHAT EVEN THOUGH SHE'S NOT G GETTING QUITE TO WHERE BARACK\nOBAMA WAS IN 2012, IF YOU LOOK AT THE MARGIN IF THIS POLL WERE\nTO HOLD HOW MUCH SHE WOULD BEAT DONALD TRUMP BY, ACTUALLY IT IS\nBY MORE THAN OBAMA BEAT MITT ROMNEY BY.\n>> BRIANNA. THANK YOU.\n\"OUTFRONT\" NOW COREY LEWANDOWSKI.\nAND --. COREY, YOU JUST HEARD MICHELLE\nOBAMA FIRST TIME ON THE TRAIL WITH HILLARY CLINTON TOGETHER,\nIMPASSIONED SPEECH ON HER BEHALF.\nHOW FORMIDABLE IS SHE? WHEN YOU WATCH MICHELLE OBAMA,\nWHAT DO YOU THINK? >> LOOK, I THINK HILLARY CLINTON\nSHOULD EMBRACE MICHELLE OBAMA EVERY CHANCE SHE GETS IF SHE\nWANTS TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nMICHELLE OBAMA IS EXCEPTIONALLY POPULAR.\nWHAT'S VERY INTERESTING AS YOU KNOW IS THE RECENT POLLS\nINDICATE THAT DONALD TRUMP IS GETTING ANYWHERE BETWEEN 18-29%\nOF THE AFRICAN AMERICAN VOTE. SO IF HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO\nGET THAT BACK I THINK MICHELLE OBAMA HAS TO BE ON THE CAMPAIGN\nTRAIL. IT IS JUST A MERE EIGHT YEARS\nTHAT MICHELLE OBAMA TOOK A PASSING SLIGHT AT HILLARY\nCLINTON AND SAID YOU CAN'T CONTROL YOUR OWN HOUSE, YOU\nCAN'T CONTROL THE WHITE HOUSE. POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY.\nBUT I DO THINK MICHELLE OBAMA IS A GOOD SURROGATE FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON RIGHT NOW AND SHE'S MUCH BETTER THAN BILL CLINTON.\nSO I THINK SHE CAN STICK WITH HER AS LONG AS HE CAN.\n>> I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH ANY POLL OR ANY POLL THAT SHOWS THAT\nBY THE WAY. BUT MICHELLE OBAMA AND HILLARY\nCLINTON HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN FRIENDS TO.\nSTATE THE OBVIOUS. AND DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN\nSEIZING ON THAT. HERE IS WHAT HE SAID.\n>> WE HAVE A PRESIDENT. ALL HE WANTS TO DO IS CAMPAIGN.\nHIS WIFE, ALL SHE WANTS DO IS CAMPAIGN.\nAND I SEE HOW MUCH HIS WIFE LIKES HILLARY.\nBUT WASN'T SHE THE ONE THAT ORIGINALLY STARTED THE STATEMENT\n\"IF YOU CAN'T TAKE CARE OF YOUR HOME --,\" RIGHT?\nYOU CAN'T TAKE CARE OF THE WHITE HOUSE OF THE COUNTRY.\n>> HE WAS REFERRING TO MICHELLE OBAMA.\nIF YOU CAN'T RUN YOUR OWN HOUSE YOU CAN'T RUN THE WHITE HOUSE.\nEVERYONE SAW THAT AS THE SLIGHT AT TIME.\nDO PEOPLE NOW BUY ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY ARE FRIENDS?\nTHIS IS GENUINE? >> ABSOLUTELY.\nAND MICHELLE OBAMA EVEN TALKED ABOUT THAT IN HER SPEECH TODAY.\nSHE SAID THAT EVER SINCE HER HUSBAND BARACK OBAMA TOOK THE\nOATH OF OFFICE BILL CLINTON AND HILLARY CLINTON HAVE BEEN\nNOTHING BUT NURTURING AND SUPPORTIVE AND REALLY GOOD\nFRIENDS. AND IN FACT I THINK IT IS\nBECAUSE THEY USED TO BE SO ADVERSARIAL, THIS NOW THAT SHE'S\nSUPPORTING HER IN SUCH A PASSIONATE WAY THAT SHE IS\nREALLY OFFERING THIS CONTRAST IS A LOT MORE CREDIBLE.\nIF YOU WANT TO BRING UP TAPES OF WHAT PEOPLE HAVE SAID BEFORE,\nLET'S BRING UP THE DONALD TRUMP TAPE WHEN HE IS SPEAKING\nBEAUTIFUL IMAGES ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON AND BILL CLINTON.\nSO, YOU KNOW, THINGS CHANGE OBVIOUSLY.\nBUT NOW MICHELLE OBAMA MADE A VERY COMPELLING CONTRAST.\nNOT JUST BETWEEN THE CHARACTER AND THE FITNESS FOR OFFICE OF\nTHESE CANDIDATES, WHICH IS, YOU KNOW, FOR HER AND FOR THE\nMAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NIGHT AND DAY BETWEEN SOMEBODY\nWHO IS NOT FIT FOR OFFICE, DONALD TRUMP AND SOMEBODY WHO IS\nREADY ON DAY ONE. BUT ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THAT\nIS MOMENT WHERE THE CHARACTER OF THE NATION IS GOING TO BE TESTED\nAS A MOTHER AND HILLARY CLINTON AS A MOTHER IT WAS VERY\nCOMPELLING. >> COREY, DO YOU GUY IT?\nTHAT THEY ARE FRIENDS NOW? MICHELLE OBAMA REALLY LIKES\nHILLARY CLINTON? >> OF COURSE NOT.\nBUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS POLITICS MAKES STRANGE BEDFELLOWS.\nALL OF A SUDDEN HILLARY CLINTON AND BERNIE SANDERS ARE BEST OF\nFRIENDS AFTER GOING AT IT FOR MONTHS AND CALLING EACH LIARS\nAND SAYING YOU STOLE THE ELECTION.\nNO YOU DID. THIS IS THE PROBLEM WITH\nPOLITICIANS. THEY SAY BAD THINGS AND THE\nELECTION IS OVER AND THEN BECOME BEST FRIENDS AND OH I REALLY\nLOVE THIS PERSON ALL OVER AGAIN. --\n>> -- DONALD TRUMP. >> -- DONALD TRUMP HAS NEVER\nTRIED TO KISS UP OF THE ESTABLISHMENT.\nHE'S BEEN VERY CLEAR. THIS IS WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\nSEE RIGHT THROUGH. THEY WEREN'T FRIENDS BEFORE.\nTHEY WERE ONLY NOW FOR POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY.\n>> NOW DONALD TRUMP IS TRYING TO WIN OTHER THE FEMALE VOTE.\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS VERY STRONG FEMALE SURROGATES FOR DIFFERENT\nGROUPS. MICHELLE OBAMA, ELIZABETH WARREN\nAMONG THEM. DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT.\nOKAY? HE HAS HIS DAUGHTER OUT THERE A\nSOMETIMES AND HIS WIFE OUT THERE NO TIMES EXCEPT FOR TODAY.\nSHE CAME OUT WITH MELANIA AND DID AN INTERVIEW SIDE BY SIDE\nWITH HIM. AND DONALD TRUMP APPEARED TO\nSURPRISE HER WHEN HE SAID SHE'S GOING TO BE OUT ON THE TRAIL A\nLOT IN THE NEXT 12 DAYS. >> DOES IT MAKE YOU WANT TO GET\nOUT THERE YOURSELF AND HELP HIM OUT THE FINAL TWO WEEKS.\n>> WE'LL SEE. MY PRIORITY IS MY SON BARON.\nOUR SON BARON. AND I SUPPORT HIM 100%.\nAND I'M THERE FOR HIM EVERY TIME HE NEEDS HIM.\nAND I MIGHT JOIN HIM. WE'LL SEE.\n>> SHE'S ACTUALLY GOING TO MAKE TWO OR THREE SPEECHES -- SHE'S\nAMAZING WHEN SHE SPEAKS. SHE'S AN AMAZING PUBLIC SPEAKER.\nSO SHE'S AGREED TO TWO OR THREE SPEECHES AND I THINK IT IS GOING\nTO BE BIG SPEECHES. IMPORTANT SPEECHES.\n>> IS THIS REALLY GOING TO HAPPEN?\nCAN SHE MAKE DIFFERENCE WITH WOMEN IN THE DAYS WE HAVE LEFT?\n12 DAYS. >> WELL I THINK SHE CAN.\nBUT, YOU KNOW, YOU HEARD HER ANSWER.\nHER NUMBER ONE PRIORITY, WHICH I THINK IS EXTREMELY COMMENDABLE\nIS SHE WANTS TO BE THE MOTHER TO HER SON.\nAND I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT.\nBECAUSE THAT IS THE NUMBER ONE PEOPLE FOR A MOTHER IS TO TAKE\nCARE OF THEIR CHILDREN. AND THAT'S WHAT SHE'S MADE HER\nPRIORITY. IS SHE GOING TO GO OUT AND\nSUPPORT HER HUSBAND O AND MAKE THREE OR FOUR SPEECH OS ARE\nFIVE. SURE SHE MADE A SPEECH AT THE\nCONVENTION. I THOUGHT WAS VERY WELL\nRECEIVED. SHE'S ARTICULATE.\nAND MORE IMPORTANTLY SHE'S BEEN A ROCK FOR THAT FAMILY.\nFOR THE TRUMP FAMILY. FOR THE CHILDREN, FOR HIM.\nSHE'S BEEN THE PERSON THAT ER TIME THEY EVER NEEDED SOMETHING\nSHE'S BEEN SUPPORTING HIM EVERY STEP OF THE WAY AND NOW SHE'S\nGOING TO COME OUT TO THE PUBLIC AND MAKE SOME SPEECHES.\nI THINK IT WILL BE THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE IN THE ELECTION.\n>> I MELANIA IS LOVELY. I THINK IT WILL BE TOO LITTLE TO\nMAKE A DIFFERENCE. THAT INTERVIEW I THINK WAS WEIRD\nAND AWKWARD AND FOR ME LOOKED LIKE COMPLETE DISRESPECT FOR\nDONALD TRUMP TO MELANIA. HE CLEARLY MADE THAT UP AS THEY\nWERE MAKING THIS INTERVIEW. SHE HAD NO IDEA SHE WAS DOING\nTHIS. I WILL BELIEVE SHE'S GOING TO\nMAKE TWO OR THREE IMPORTANT SPEECHES.\nTHE MOMENT HE GIVES US HIS TAXES WHICH HE ALSO PROMISED BEFORE\nTHE ELECTION. WE'VE YET TO SEE THAT.\n>> THEY ARE WITH HILLARY'S E-MAILS.\n>> AND NEXT SHARK TANK BARBARA CORCORAN OPENS UP ABOUT DONALD\nTRUMP. WHAT'S HE REALLY LIKE WITH\nWOMEN? WHAT'S HE REALLY LIKE BEHIND\nCLOSED DOORS? SHE'S GOING TO TELL YOU.\nAND TRUMP LEADING TEXAS BY JUST THREE POINTS.\nTHAT IS WITHIN THE MARGIN OF ERROR.\nCOULD TEXAS TURN BLUE? CH",

IF THEY LIVE IN ARIZONA --\n>> CONGRESSMAN, I THINK YOU'RE MISSING A POINT TALKING ABOUT\nHER EFFECTIVENESS AS A SPEAKER. AND YOU MAY BE RIGHT ABOUT\nOBAMACARE AND THE PREMIUMS, BUT JUST HER AS AN EFFECTIVE GREAT\nSPEAKER. AND WE HAVE GREAT AFFINITY FOR\nALL OF OUR FIRST LADIES. I DON'T THINK THERE'S FIRST LADY\nPEOPLE HAVE HATED. I CAN'T REMEMBER AT LEAST IN MY\nLIFETIME, PEOPLE LOVED LAURA AND BARBARA BUSH AND NANCY REAGAN.\nWHY CAN'T PEOPLE LOVE MICHELLE OBAMA?\n>> SHE'S VERY EFFECTIVE. SHE GIVE THE BEST SPEECH IN THE\nDNC HANDS DOWN F.. IF SHE WANTS TO RUN FOR\nSOMETHING, SHE'S VERY GOOD AT IT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\nI GET YOU, DON, 100%. I DON'T KNOW LOVE FOR THE FIRST\nLADY IS WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO VOTE ON WHEN THEY'RE HURTING\nECONOMICALLY, WHEN THEY'RE SCARED ABOUT TERRORISM, WHETHER\nTHEY'RE CASTING THEIR BALLOT, I DON'T KNOW IF LOVE FOR THE FIRST\nLADY IS GOING TO BE THE BENE\nBENEFACTOR. >> I WILL TELL YOU YOUNG PEOPLE,\nESPECIALLY MILLENNIAL, THE HIGHEST APPROVAL RATING WITH ANY\nPOLITICIAN WOULD BE MICHELLE AND B\nBARACK OBAMA AMONG THAT DEMOGRAPHIC.\n>> FIRST OF ALL YOU SAY THESE NOT A THOUGHT LEADER, I THINK\nTHAT'S HIGHLY -- I'M NOT GOING TO SAY IT'S OFFENSIVE, IT'S JUST\nWRONG. SHE'S ACTUALLY CHANGED THE\nNATIONAL CONVERSATION WHEN IT COMES TO CHILDREN'S FITNESS,\nCHILDREN'S HEALTH, WHEN IT COMES TO THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IN\nOUR COUNTRY, OUR FUTURE GENERATION, AND ALSO OUR\nVETERANS, SHE'S BEEN RIGHT OUT THERE AS BIG AS ANYBODY.\nBUT MUCH MORE IMPORTANTLY, IF YOU TRY TO PUT HER DOWN, YOU'RE\nBY YOURSELF. DONALD TRUMP, WHO SLAPS BACK AT\nEVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO EVER SAYS ANYTHING BAD ABOUT HIM,\nEVEN IF IT'S A GOLD STAR MOM, IF IT'S SOME UNKNOWN BEAUTY\nPAGEANT, HE'S UP -- YOU CAN'T MESS WITH DONALD TRUMP.\n>> BUT MICHELLE OBAMA HAS GONE OUT --\n>> YOU HAD YOUR TURN. YOU HAD YOUR TURN.\nMICHELLE OBAMA HAS GONE AFTER HIM SPEECH, AFTER SPEECH, AFTER\nSPEECH, AND DONALD TRUMP HAS NOT BROKEN BREATH TO SAY ONE WORD,\nONE TWEET, NOTHING BECAUSE HE RECOGNIZES THE POWER THAT HE\nHAS. >> CONGRESSMAN QUICKLY I HAVE TO\nGO TO BREAK. >> NUMBER ONE SHE'S TRYING TO\nPROP UP HILLARY CLINTON, WHO BRINGS NO ENTHUSIASM.\nTHAT'S WHY THE CROWD WAS BIG TODAY, BECAUSE OF MICHELLE\nOBAMA. >> BIG CROWDS DON'T MEAN BIG\nVOTES, AND BERNIE. >> LET HIM FINISH.\n>> AND MICHELLE OBAMA CAN GO OUT THERE AND SAY ALL THOSE GOOD\nTHINGS ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON, BUT IT'S STILL HILLARY CLINTON,\nAND PEOPLE ARE NOT ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THAT.\nTHAT'S WHY SHE CAN'T GET A BIG CROWD.\n>> HERE'S THE THING -- OKAY. >> AND BEYOND --\n>> QUICKLY I GOTTA. >> -- BEHIND THE CHEERING YOU\nHAVE OBAMACARE, YOU HAVE A WEAK ECONOMY, YOU DON'T HAVE HOPE OR\nJOBS FOR THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO NEED JOBS WHO ARE GOING OUT IN\nTHE WORKPLACE. THEY'RE VERY UNEASY ABOUT THE\nECONOMY. THEY'RE VERY UNEASY ABOUT\nNATIONAL SECURITY. >> ALL THE PEOPLE YOU MENTION\nAUDIO. >> YOU CAN TRY AND MAKE THIS\nCASE. YOUNG PEOPLE ARE FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON. >> PEOPLE OF COLOR WHO LIVE IN\nCERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS, MICHELLE OBAMA IS EFFECTIVE AT SPEAKING\nTO THEM. I WONDER IF DONALD TRUMP WAS AS\nEFFECTIVE AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT AFTER THE BREAK.",

AFTER PRESIDENT OBAMA NAMED\nCLINTON AS HIS SECRETARY OF STATE, THE TENSION BETWEEN THE\nTWO WOMEN REPORTEDLY CONTINUED.

MAYBE IN 2020.\nONE WOMAN TOLD ME IF MICHELLE OBAMA AND HILLARY CLINTON WERE\nON THE SAME PRESIDENTIAL TICKET, ABSOLUTELY VOTE FOR MICHELLE\nOBAMA. IT'S NOT JUST WOMEN.\nSHE'S VERY POPULAR AMONG THAT CROWD WITH THE MEN IN THE CROWD,\nYOUNG AND OLD, BLACK AND WHITE, YOU NAME IT AND SHE'S REALLY\nBRINGING IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS INTO THE TENT FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON. I TALKED TO MANY OF THEM WHO HAD\nFELT OVER THIS CAMPAIGN THEY HAVEN'T HAD A HERO IN THE RACE\nWITHOUT BARACK OBAMA, NOT FEELING THE SAME PASSION FOR\nHILLARY CLINTON. AND I THINK JUDGING FROM WHAT I\nHEARD TODAY, FOUND THEIR HERO IN THE RACE AND IT'S MICHELLE\nOBAMA. >> THANKS VERY MUCH.\nTHE PANEL IS BACK WITH US THIS HOUR.\nIT IS INTERESTING TO SEE YOU HEAR IN THAT REPORT THEY MAYBE\nONCE HAD MORE OF A ROCKY RELATIONSHIP.\nCLEARLY MICHELLE OBAMA SEES HER HUSBAND'S LEGACY AT STAKE HERE\nAS MUCH AS ANYTHING ELSE. >> WITHOUT A DOUBT.\nSHE IS ALL IN ON THE HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN AND IN A WAY\nSHE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN WHEN THIS STARTED OUT.\nWOULD HAVE DONE WHAT WAS ASKED OF HER BUT\nSHE HAS SEEN THIS QUEST THAT HILLARY CLINTON AND HER TEAM\nHAVE PUT TOGETHER TO RECREATE THE OBAMA COALITION,\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS, YOUNG VOTERS, LATINO VOTERS AND SHE\nKNOWS THAT SHE AND HER HUSBAND CAN GO A LONG WAY IN\nHELPING HILLARY CLINTON FORM THAT.\nTHEY SEE THAT AS THE PATH TO SUCCESS.\nYOU'RE 100% RIGHT. THIS IS ABOUT A LEGACY BUT IT IS\nNOT JUST ABOUT A LEGACY. I THINK MICHELLE OBAMA REALLY\nDOES BELIEVE IN WHAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN ABOUT.\n>> SHE SPOKE AT THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION BUT HOW BIG WAS THIS\n\"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD\" TAPE? AFTER THAT WE HEARD HER GETTING\nPOWERFUL SPEECH AND THEN THIS SPEECH AGAIN TODAY.\n>> I THINK THAT FIRST OF ALL MICHELLE OBAMA IS THE MOST\nEFFECTIVE COMMUNICATOR ON PLANET EARTH.\nSHE IS BETTER THAN PRESIDENT OBAMA, BETTER THAN BILL CLINTON\nAT HIS BEST, AN EXTRAORDINARY COMMUNICATOR.\nAMAZING TO ME IS ONCE THAT \"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD\" TAPE\nCAME OUT, WHEN SHE CAME OUT SHE WENT RIGHT AFTER DONALD TRUMP\nTHAT WAS BRACING AND HE NEVER FIRED BACK ONCE.\nHE FIRES BACK AT EVERYBODY, A GOLD STAR MOM, WHOEVER YOU ARE.\nIF YOU SAY ONE BAD WORD ABOUT HIM,\nHE'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT YOU FOR FOUR DAYS.\nHE HAS STILL TO THIS DAY NEVER FIRED BACK.\nTHAT GIVES YOU A SENSE OF THE OVERWHELMING POWER IN HIS\nOF HER POPULARITY AND COMMUNICATION.\n>> MY FAVORITE PART WAS YOUNG LADY WHO SAID THAT BLACK GIRL\nMAGIC. THAT SAYS IT ALL.\n>> MILLENIAL SLOGAN. >> EXACTLY.\n>> THE THING ABOUT MICHELLE OBAMA SHE HAS THE MIDAS TOUCH,\nTHE POLITICAL GOLD. SHE HAS EVERYTHING GOING FOR HER\nAND HILLARY CLINTON IS VERY, VERY LUCKY TO HAVE MICHELLE\nOBAMA IN HER CORNER. THING ABOUT MICHELLE OBAMA IS\nSHE SPEAKS LIKE A MOM. SHE DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A\nPOLITICIAN AND THAT'S WHY PEOPLE ARE VERY MUCH DRAWN TO HER.\nSHE SOUND LIKE A WIFE, A MOM, YOU KNOW, AND I THINK IT'S JUST\nAMAZING TO WATCH. >> AS A TRUMP SUPPORTER, DO YOU\nFEAR MICHELLE OBAMA IS THE RIGHT WORD, DO YOU HOPE SHE DOESN'T\nSPEND TOO MUCH MORE TIME OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL?\n>> YES I WOULD SAY SO. I AGREE WITH VAN JONES SHE'S AN\nEXTRAORDINARILY EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATOR, SHE'S VERY GOOD AT\nSPEAKING AND WOULD HAVE A BRIGHT POLITICAL FUTURE.\nTHAT BEING SAID I DON'T KNOW THAT LIKABILITY TRANSLATES.\nIT'S IMPORTANT IN A PRESIDENTIAL RACE, THE CANDIDATE WHO FARES\nBETTER TENDS TO WIN THE ELECTION.\nBOTH CANDIDATES ARE UNLIKEABLE AND UNFAVORABLE.\nI'M NOT SURE MICHELLE OBAMA LIKABILITY TRANSLATES TO THE\nTO THE VOTERS IN THE BOOTH SAYING WHO IS GOING TO BETTER\nOBAMACARE AND THE ECONOMY. I DON'T THINK LIKABILITY OF\nMICHELLE OBAMA IS GOING TO WEIGH IN THAT.\n>> IT COULD IN TERMS OF MILLENIAL VOTERS THERE'S BEEN AN\nENTHUSIASM GAP FOR HILLARY CLINTON PARTICULARLY AMONG\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN MILLENIAL VOTERS.\nMAYBE MAKES A DIFFERENCE THERE. >> I THINK THE QUESTION IS CAN\nWE GO BEYOND INDIVIDUAL SURROGATES AS GREAT ADS MICHELLE\nOBAMA IS AND CAN HILLARY CLINTON TURN THIS INTO A LATE SURGE OF\nENTHUSIASM? IN 1992 YOU SAW IS CRYSTALIZED\nAS YEAR OF THE WOMAN. YOU SAW WOMEN GET SWEPT INTO THE\nSENATE, HELPED BILL CLINTON WIN THE PRESIDENCY AND NOT JUST\nMICHELLE OBAMA BUT ELIZABETH WARREN, YOU SAW OPRAH WINFREY UP\nTHERE. J. LO WILL BE PERFORMING.\nCAN YOU GET NOT JUST MILLENIAL ENTHUSIASM BUT MILLENIAL FEMALE\nENTHUSIASM AND CAN THAT SWEEP HILLARY IN AND ALSO SWEEP OUT\nTHE SENATE TOWARDS THE DEMOCRATS.\nI THINK THAT'S THE BIGGER QUESTION.\nIF IT'S JUST AS INDIVIDUAL SURROGATES, BUMP IN\nNORTH CAROLINA AND OTHERS BUT BROADER PHENOMENON THAT CAN HELP\nYOU IN NEVADA.\nEVEN NORTH CAROLINA. >> I THINK YOU'RE SEEING AN\nINCREDIBLE SURROGATE SURGE HERE AT THE END.\nALICIA KEYS DROPPED ON WHILE WE WERE HERE TONIGHT.\n>> MOVE ON -- >> I WONDER WHERE THE VIDEO CAME\nFROM. I JUST THOUGHT I DON'T KNOW,\nTHANK YOU! IT WAS AMAZING!\nANYWAY, A BIG SURROGATE SURGE GOING ON FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\n>> IN TERMS OF, I MEAN THE NUMBER OF, OBVIOUSLY ON THE\nDEMOCRATIC SIDE THERE'S A DEEP BENCH OF SURROGATES, POPULAR\nSURROGATES, GOOD SPEAKERS. LESS SO ON DONALD TRUMP'S SIDE,\nYET HE IS PULLING HUGE CROWDS AND THERE IS ENTHUSIASM CLEARLY\nVISIBLE IN HUGE RALLIES STILL. >> DONALD TRUMP A SURROGATE.\nTHE MORE POLITICIANS HELP HIM THE WORSE.\nHE'S RUNNING AGAINST WASHINGTON. TO HAVE POLITICIANS COMING IN\nTHINK HE'S GREAT IT WOULD BREAK THE MESSAGE HE'S RUN ON FOR SO\nLONG. >> DONALD TRUMP SAID MELANIA\nTRUMP WILL BE MAKING TWO TO THREE SPEECHES.\nSHE ALMOST SEEMED SURPRISED OR STEPHANOPOLOUS SEEMED TO THINK\nSHE WAS SURPRISED. IT'S NOT SOMETHING SHE'S DONE\nREALLY SINCE THE CONVENTION. SHE'S VERY ELOQUENT, VERY\nPOISED. DO YOU THINK THAT IS SOMETHING\nTHAT CAN HELP DONALD TRUMP? >> CLEARLY.\nI THINK SHE SOFTENS HIM AND SOMETHING THAT GETS GREAT MEDIA\nCOVERAGE WHERE WOMEN CAN SEE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE OF DONALD\nTRUMP, A LOVING CARING FATHERLY FIGURE AND\nMAYBE PERSONALIZE IT, THAT COULD HELP.\n>> THE TOWN HALL WE DID WITH DONALD TRUMP AND HIS FAMILY.\nTO SEE HIM ON THE STAGE WITH HIS KIDS IT IMPRESSED\nA LOT OF PEOPLE. >> EVEN WHEN HILLARY WAS ASKED\nTO SEE WHAT SHE ADMIRED MOST, IS HIS KIDS.\nYOU HAVEN'T SEEN IVAN KA AS MUCH AS YOU THOUGHT.\nRIBBON CUTTING RECENTLY. BUT WANTED TO SAY\nTONIGHT'S UNFORTUNATE EVENT SOMETIMES CAN TURN PEOPLE INTO\nSYMPATHETIC FIGURES. YOU WONDER WHETHER SOMEONE LIKE\nMIKE PENCE, SOLID BUT FRANKLY BLAND, WHETHER OR NOT THE TRUMP\nTEAM CAN TURN THIS INTO SOMETHING MORE.\nMIKE PENCE DISPATCHED TO NEBRASKA, WEIRD THEY HAVE HIM IN\nNEBRASKA WHETHER OR NOT YOU COULD USE HIM IN DIFFERENT WAYS\nCOULD BE AN INTERESTING OPPORTUNITY TO USE SOMEONE LIKE\nMIKE PENCE DIFFERENTLY. >> I'D LIKE TO THANK EVERYBODY\nON THE PANEL. JUST AHEAD, MORE ON THE NEW\nBATCH OF LEAKED CLINTON E-MAILS. THE PICTURE THEY PAINT OF THE\nMOMENT WHEN NEWS OF CLINTON'S PRIVATE EMAIL SERVER HIT IT'S\nFASCINATING.",

RECENTLY, EXPANDING IT.\nAND DIFFERENT PRESIDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES DO DIFFERENT\nTHINGS TO THE WHITE HOUSE, THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES THAT THE NEXT\nOCCUPANTS WILL KEEP ANYTHING THAT THE LAST OCCUPANTS OF THE\nWHITE HOUSE DID TO THE GROUNDS. THE NEW PRESIDENT WOULD BE\nABSOLUTELY FREE TO PLOW THE VEGETABLE GARDEN UNDER, IF THEY\nLIKE, RIGHT?

REALLY EXPECT MELANIA TRUMP OR\nBILL CLINTON TO BE OUT THERE TENDING TO THE TURNIPS AND\nHARVESTING THE OKRA? REALLY?\nARE THEY GOING TO KEEP IT? AS HER TIME GROWS SHORT,\nMICHELLE OBAMA HAS HARDENED THE GARDEN'S DEFENSES.\nSHE UNVEILED AN EXPANDED GARDEN NOW TWICE ITS ORIGINAL SIZE AND\nIT'S GOT HARD PARTS. STONE WALKWAYS AND PLANTERS MADE\nFROM CONCRETE AND STEEL AND PICNIC TABLES AND STUFF.\nFIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA ANNOUNCED A MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR\nGRANT FOR MAINTAINING IT. SO IT WON'T BE AN EXCUSE IF THEY\nWANTED TO GET RID OF THE GARDEN FOR THAT REASON.\nNOT INCIDENTALLY, MICHELLE OBAMA PLANTED A COUPLE OF CROPS THAT\nARE IN THE GROUND NOW THAT WON'T BE READY FOR HARVEST UNTIL THE\nSPRING, WHEN THERE'S A NEW PRESIDENT.\nWHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? WASTE THAT FOOD?\nSO IT'S BEEN A DISCUSSION. WILL THE NEXT PRESIDENT KEEP THE\nGARDEN OR PUT UP A PARKING LOT? TODAY WE GOT AN ANSWER.\nAT LEAST IF HILLARY CLINTON WINS.\n>> NOW SHE ALSO PLANTED AN AMAZING VEGETABLE GARDEN AT THE\nWHITE HOUSE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]\nAND I CAN PROMISE YOU, IF I WIN, I WILL TAKE GOOD CARE OF IT,\nMICHELLE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]\n>> IF HILLARY CLINTON WINS THE ELECTION, THE GARDEN LIVES!\nLOOK HOW HAPPY THAT MAKES MICHELLE OBAMA.\nI DON'T RLLY TOTALLY UNDERSTAND WHY I'M SO ATTACHED\nTO THIS VEGETABLE GARDEN, BEYOND THE OBVIOUS REASONS THAT I AM A\nCARD-CARRYING MEMBER OF THE LIBERAL VEGETABLE LOBBY.\nBUT IF THERE IS A STEADY STREAM OF IMAGES IN BILL CLINTON\nTILLING THE SOIL, DEADHEADING STUFF, THAT WOULD BE A LEGACY TO\nCELEBRATE.

THAT'S RIGHT.\nHILLARY DOESN'T PLAY. >> HILLARY DOESN'T PLAY.\nTHAT WAS HILLARY CLINTON AND MICHELLE OBAMA TODAY IN\nWINSTON-SALEM, NORTH CAROLINA. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THEY HAVE\nDONE A JOINT CAMPAIGN APPEARANCE.\nAND, AS THAT WAS KIND OF, WE PLAYED THAT BIT THERE TO GIVE\nYOU A SENSE OF THE VIBE THERE. I THINK BASICALLY TAKING TURNS\nHEAPING PRAISE ON ONE ANOTHER, AND THIS EVENT WAS ONE OF\nHILLARY CLINTON'S BIGGEST EVENTS OF THE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN.\nTHERE WERE APPARENTLY 14,000 PEOPLE THERE AT THIS NORTH\nCAROLINA RALLY TODAY. AND THIS WAS A GOOD ONE TO\nCHOOSE TO BE A BIG ONE, BECAUSE MICHELLE OBAMA WAS THERE.\nONE OF THE MOST BELOVED FIGURES IN POLITICS RIGHT NOW.\nONE OF THE MOST POPULAR FIGURES IN POLITICS, CERTAINLY AMONG\nDEMOCRATS, PARTICULARLY AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICAN DEMOCRATS, AND\nA ABSOLUTELY KEY CONSTITUENCY. THIS MAY HAVE BEEN ONE OF\nHILLARY CLINTON'S MOST IMPORTANT APPEARANCES TODAY.\nAND IT WAS WARM. AND HILLARY CLINTON WAS AT HER\nBEST, AND IT WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE THINGS SHE\nHAS DONE. BUT.\nWHAT MIGHT BE MOST IMPORTANT HERE IS WE GOT AN ANSWER TO A\nQUESTION THAT HAS BEEN FLOATING AROUND THE OBAMA FAMILY'S\nPENDING DEPARTURE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.\nNOW THIS HAS NOT BEEN COVERED WIDELY TODAY.\nMAYBE EVERYBODY ELSE DOESN'T SEE THIS AS THE BIGGEST DEAL OF THE\nWORLD. I REALIZE THAT THE FATE OF THE\nFREE WORLD DOES NOT RELY ON THIS QUESTION.\nBUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S A STRESSFUL TIME.\nIN THIS MOST STRESSFUL OF ELECTIONS, WE HERE AT THE SHOW\nAND WE IN MY FAMILY HAVE BEEN CHEWING ON OUR FINGERNAILS A\nLITTLE BIT, WONDERING WITH A LITTLE BIT OF ACTUAL STRESS\nWHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE WHITE HOUSE VEGETABLE GARDEN.\nWHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO IT? THE KITCHEN GARDEN PLANTED BY\nFIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA. THIS HAS BEEN A PASSION OF HER\nTIME IN THE WHITE HOUSE, FOR ALMOST THE ENTIRE TIME SHE'S\nBEEN THERE, SHE'S BEEN BUILDING IT UP, MAINTAINING IT AND\nSHOWING IT OFF. RECENTLY, EXPANDING IT.\nAND DIFFERENT PRESIDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES DO DIFFERENT\nTHINGS TO THE WHITE HOUSE, THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES THAT THE NEXT\nOCCUPANTS WILL KEEP ANYTHING THAT THE LAST OCCUPANTS OF THE\nWHITE HOUSE DID TO THE GROUNDS. THE NEW PRESIDENT WOULD BE\nABSOLUTELY FREE TO PLOW THE VEGETABLE GARDEN UNDER, IF THEY\nLIKE, RIGHT? JIMMY CARTER, YOU WANT TO PUT\nSOLAR PANELS ON THE WHITE HOUSE, RONALD REAGAN WANTS TO TAKE THEM\nDOWN. REALLY EXPECT MELANIA TRUMP OR\nBILL CLINTON TO BE OUT THERE TENDING TO THE TURNIPS AND\nHARVESTING THE OKRA? REALLY?\nARE THEY GOING TO KEEP IT? AS HER TIME GROWS SHORT,\nMICHELLE OBAMA HAS HARDENED THE GARDEN'S DEFENSES.\nSHE UNVEILED AN EXPANDED GARDEN NOW TWICE ITS ORIGINAL SIZE AND\nIT'S GOT HARD PARTS. STONE WALKWAYS AND PLANTERS MADE\nFROM CONCRETE AND STEEL AND PICNIC TABLES AND STUFF.\nFIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA ANNOUNCED A MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR\nGRANT FOR MAINTAINING IT. SO IT WON'T BE AN EXCUSE IF THEY\nWANTED TO GET RID OF THE GARDEN FOR THAT REASON.\nNOT INCIDENTALLY, MICHELLE OBAMA PLANTED A COUPLE OF CROPS THAT\nARE IN THE GROUND NOW THAT WON'T BE READY FOR HARVEST UNTIL THE\nSPRING, WHEN THERE'S A NEW PRESIDENT.\nWHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? WASTE THAT FOOD?\nSO IT'S BEEN A DISCUSSION. WILL THE NEXT PRESIDENT KEEP THE\nGARDEN OR PUT UP A PARKING LOT? TODAY WE GOT AN ANSWER.\nAT LEAST IF HILLARY CLINTON WINS.\n>> NOW SHE ALSO PLANTED AN AMAZING VEGETABLE GARDEN AT THE\nWHITE HOUSE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]\nAND I CAN PROMISE YOU, IF I WIN, I WILL TAKE GOOD CARE OF IT,\nMICHELLE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]\n>> IF HILLARY CLINTON WINS THE ELECTION, THE GARDEN LIVES!\nLOOK HOW HAPPY THAT MAKES MICHELLE OBAMA.\nI DON'T REALLY TOTALLY UNDERSTAND WHY I'M SO ATTACHED\nTO THIS VEGETABLE GARDEN, BEYOND THE OBVIOUS REASONS THAT I AM A\nCARD-CARRYING MEMBER OF THE LIBERAL VEGETABLE LOBBY.\nBUT IF THERE IS A STEADY STREAM OF IMAGES IN BILL CLINTON\nTILLING THE SOIL, DEADHEADING STUFF, THAT WOULD BE A LEGACY TO\nCELEBRATE. THAT DOES IT FOR US TONIGHT.\nNOW IT'S TIME FOR \"THE LAST WORD\", WITH LAWRENCE O'DONNELL.\n>> ANY WORD FROM MELANIA TRUMP ON THE VEGETABLE GARDEN?\n>> NO, BUT I THINK MY PHONE IS BROKEN.\nI HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HER IN A LONG TIME.\n>> WE'RE FOLLOWING BREAKING NEWS TONIGHT, INVOLVING MIKE PENCE'S\nCAMPAIGN AIRPLANE. EVERYONE IS SAFE AFTER MIKE\nPENCE'S PLANE SLID OFF A RAIN-SOAKED RUNWAY AT LAGUARDIA\nAIRPORT EARLIER TONIGHT WHILE LANDING.\nWE WILL HAVE A LIVE REPORT FROM",

AND I WANT TO THANK OUR FIRST\nLADY FOR HER ELOQUENT, POWERFUL DEFENSE OF THAT BASIC VALUE.\n>> Reporter: LAST DEBATE AND REVELATIONS IN THE TAPE LED TO A\nBUMP AMONG WOMEN VOTERS FOR CLINTON.\nTHE DRIP, DRIP, DRIP OF WIKILEAKS E-MAILS ORCHESTRATED\nTHE U.S. INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AND CAMPAIGNS SAY BY RUSSIA TO\nHARM CLINTON IS CAUSING THE DROP IN POLL NUMBERS.\nA NEW FOX NEWS POLL SHOWS CLINTON HAS HIT A NEW LOW ON\nHONESTY AND TRUSTWORTHINESS. 67% SAY SHE'S UNTRUSTWORTHY.\nIT SHOWS CLINTON'S CLOSEST CAMPAIGN ADVISORS HAVE STRUGGLED\nWITH HER BAGGAGE. THEY WROTE TO JOHN PODESTA IN\nJULY OF 2015, DO WE ACTUALLY KNOW WHO TOLD HILLARY SHE COULD\nUSE A PRIVATE E-MAIL? HAS THAT PERSON BEEN DRAWN AND\nQUARTERED? MICHELLE OBAMA AND HILLARY\nCLINTON WAS NOT ALWAYS CLOSE, CONCERNS ABOUT THE BULLYING\nRHETORIC UNLEASHED DURING THIS ELECTION BROUGHT THE FIRST LADY\nOUT TO DELIVER CLINTON'S STRONGEST CLOSING ARGUMENT FOR\nTOLERANCE AND ACCEPTANCE. >> THEY ARE TRYING TO CONVINCE\nYOU THAT YOUR VOTE DOESN'T MATTER.\nTHAT THE OUTCOME HAS ALREADY BEEN DETERMINED.\nYOU SHOULDN'T EVEN BOTHER MAKING YOUR VOICE HEARD.\nTHEY ARE TRYING TO TAKE AWAY YOUR HOPE.\n>> Reporter: MICHELLE OBAMA NEVER MENTIONED DONALD TRUMP BY\nNAME TODAY. SHE REMINDED THE CROWD THAT HER\nHUSBAND WON NORTH CAROLINA IN 2008 BY JUST 14,000 VOTES.\nHE LOST IN 2012, EVEN THOUGH THE DEMOCRATS HELD THEIR CONVENTION\nHERE. SHE SAID DON'T LET ANYONE TELL\nYOU THAT YOUR VOTE DOESN'T MATTER.\n>> JENNIFER, THANK YOU.",

THEY'RE THERE TO PROTECT THEIR\nLAND. >> SOMEONE WENT OUT TO HILLARY\nCLINTON'S CAMPAIGN OFFICE TODAY, I THINK WE MAY HAVE VIDEO OF\nTHAT, TRYING TO GET A RESPONSE FROM THE CAMPAIGN ABOUT IT.\nTHEY HAD TROUBLE DELIVERING THEIR LETTER TO THE CAMPAIGN.\nTHERE THEY ARE IN THE CAMPAIGN OFFICE, BUT EVENTUALLY, THE\nLETTER GOT THROUGH, THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN RELEASED A STATEMENT\nSAYING WE RECEIVED THE LETTER TODAY FROM REPRESENTATIVES OF\nTHE TRIBES. THERE IS NO REAL POSITION\nREVEALED HERE. IT ENDS WITH THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN STATEMENT SAYING IT'S IMPORTANT THAT ON THE GROUND IN\nNORTH DAKOTA EVERYONE RESPECTS DEMONSTRATORS' RIGHTS TO PROTEST\nPEACEFULLY AND WORKERS' RIGHTS TO DO THEIR JOBBING SAFELY.\nSO THAT DOESN'T CLARIFY MUCH ABOUT WHERE A POSSIBLE PRESIDENT\nCLINTON WOULD STAND. >> NO.\nAND RIGHT NOW, IF YOU WENT TO THE 1851 TREATY, THE LAND\nTREATY, THIS LAND BELONGS TO THE NATIVES, AND THE --\n>> THE TREATY THAT WE VIOLATED. >> A TREATY THAT WE VIOLATED\nSEVERAL, SEVERAL, SEVERAL TIMES. THIS LAND BELONGS TO THE\nNATIVESEN, AND ALL PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS TO DO IS BASICALLY\nWITH THE STROKE OF A PEN SAY THAT LAND BELONGS TO THE\nNATIVES, BACK OFF. THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WERE AT\nHILLARY'S OFFICE, ON THE FRONT LINE, WHO STARTED THIS MOVEMENT,\nALL MET WITH OBAMA TWO YEARS AGO.\n>> YES, YES. >> AND HE PROMISED TO PROTECT\nTHEM. HE TOOK THEM TO THE WHITE HOUSE.\n>> HE STOPPED THE CONSTRUCTION AND THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS\nCONTROLS THAT. HE DID WHAT HE COULD.\nWHAT MIGHT THE NEXT PRESIDENT DO?\n>> WE KNOW WHERE BERNIE CAME OUT ON THIS.\n>> BERNIE'S OPPOSED TO IT. >> WE KNOW WHERE HE'S GOING TO\nCOME OUT. AND WE'RE WAITING TO HEAR FROM\nCLINTON, A DEFINITIVE ANSWER OF WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN HERE.\nTHIS PIPELINE DOES NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH HERE.\nEVERY OTHER PIPELINE IN THE STATE GOES --\n>> WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO BE THERE? >> I HAVE BEEN, I'VE BEEN IN A\nLOT OF PROTESTS. I'VE NEVER BEEN IN ONE THAT WAS\nSO MOVING, DETERMINED, RESPECTFUL, SOLEMN, LOVING AND\nKIND. IT WAS, I WAS AT OCCUPY WALL\nSTREET, THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE, HERE IN NEW YORK STATE AS WE\nFOUGHT AGAINST FRACKING, AND I'VE NEVER BEEN AROUND SUCH A\nDECENT GROUP OF PEOPLE. >> THAT WAS MY EXPERIENCE OUT\nTHERE TOO, THANK YOU. REALLY APPRECIATE IT.\nTHAT'S IT FOR THE LAST WORD TONIGHT, THE 11 HOUR WITH BRIAN\nWILLIAMS IS LIVE, AND IT IS",

THE SIOUX TRIBE IS CALLING FOR\nTHE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO INVESTIGATE CLAIMS OF LAW\nENFORCEMENT ABUSE. ALL THIS OVER A $3.7 BILLION OIL\nPIPELINE THAT CROSSES FOUR STATES BUT WOULD CROSS THROUGH\nWHAT THE TRIBE CLAIMS IS SACRED NATIVE AMERICAN LAND.\nTHE DEVELOPER SAYS THE PROJECT WOULD BE AN ECONOMIC BOOM.\n7.4 BILLION BARRELS OF OIL. PROTESTERS SAY THE CONSTRUCTION\nPROJECT WOULD DESTROY BURIAL GROUNDS AND POTENTIALLY DISRUPT\nTHEIR WATER SUPPLY. JOINING ME NOW ONE OF THE\nPROTESTERS, ACTOR AND ACTIVIST MARK RUFFALO.\nTHANK YOU FOR JOINING US. YOU SPENT THREE DAYS AT THE\nPROTEST SITE THIS WEEK DEMONSTRATING ON BEHALF OF THE\nSTANDING ROCK SIOUX TRIBE. WHAT MOTIVATED YOU TO JOIN THE\nPROTEST? >> I MADE RELATIONSHIPS WITH\nTHESE PEOPLE DURING THE CLIMATE MARCH HERE IN NEW YORK.\n500,000 PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD GATHERED TO STOP CLIMATE\nCHANGE. AND I ALSO GOT TO KNOW SOME OF\nTHEM WHILE WE WERE MAKING \"FIGHTING AGAINST HYDRO\nFRACKING\" HERE IN NEW YORK STATE.\nULTIMATELY, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF THE WORK I DO HAS TO DO WITH\nPROTECTING WATER, AND THAT'S WHAT THESE PEOPLE ARE DOING\nTHERE. AND SO I WAS INVITED BY SOME OF\nTHE FOLKS I KNEW THERE TO DELIVER A SOLAR SYSTEM TO POWER\nTHE CAMP FOR THE WINTERTIME, WAHALA JOHNS IS A NAVAJO LEADER\nWHO BUILT THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND ASKED ME TO JOIN HER WHEN WE\nWENT TO DELIVER IT. >> INTERESTING.\nSO THE SIOUX AND OTHER PROTESTERS ARE SAYING THAT THE\nLAW ENFORCEMENT HAVE BEEN VIOLENT.\nHAVE YOU WITNESSED ANY VIOLENCE AGAINST THE PROTESTERS?\n>> I DIDN'T WITNESS ANY VIOLENCE WHILE I WAS THERE.\nBUT I WITNESSED AND HEARD THE STORIES FROM THE YOUNG PEOPLE\nWHO HAD WITNESSED AND FELT THE VIOLENCE.\nI MET A GIRL WHO HAD HER ARM BROKEN A FEW DAYS AGO.\nMANY OF THE PROTESTERS HAD HAD ENCOUNTERS WITH THE POLICE IN\nTHEIR ARRESTS WHERE THEY WERE THROWN INTO JAIL CELLS NAKED,\nTHEY WERE STRIP-SEARCHED. WE HAD AN ENCOUNTER WITH THE\nPOLICE YESTERDAY. WE WENT TO ONE OF THE ROAD\nBLOCKS JUST TO SAY HELLO AND GET A SENSE OF THE FEELING THERE.\nAND THE FEELING THAT THE POLICE WERE SORT OF EMANATING.\nAND IT WAS DEFINITELY -- THERE WAS TWO POLICE OFFICERS WITH\nAR-15s WITH THEIR FINGERS RIGHT NEXT TO THE TRIGGER, WITH THE\nDARK SUNGLASSES ON. VERY, VERY AGGRESSIVE.\nNOW, I SPENT THE DAY ON THE CAMP, IN THE CAMP, THE FORWARD\nCAMP, THE ONE YOU ARE SEEING HERE, WHERE PEOPLE WERE ENGAGED\nIN PRAYER. EVERY SINGLE PERSON YOU SEE\nTHERE WAS TRAINED IN PEACEFUL RESISTANCE, WHICH MEANS THAT NO\nONE IS ALLOWED OUT IN THAT AREA UNLESS THEY'VE HAD SOME SORT OF\nPEACEFUL RESISTANCE TRAINING. THE MANTRA OF THE PLACE IS IT'S\nNOT THE POLICE, IT'S THE PIPELINE THAT WE'RE PROTESTING\nOR PROTECTING OURSELVES AGAINST. AND THEY SPEND BASICALLY THE\nENTIRE DAY DOING PRAYERS, CHANTING.\nI HAVE NEVER BEEN AROUND SO PEACEFUL A STAND.\nIT'S LED BY YOUNG PEOPLE. YOU CAN SEE IN THESE PHOTOS.\nTHE FIRST PEOPLE WHO BEGAN THIS WHOLE MOVEMENT WERE YOUNG PEOPLE\nFROM 10 YEARS OLD TO 17, 18 YEARS OLD.\nAND THE TRIBAL LEADERS ARE STILL TAKING THEIR LEAD FROM THEM.\n>> SO, LET ME JUST ASK YOU TO PLAY DEVIL'S ADVOCATE.\nTHE DEVELOPER SAYS IT IS PRIVATE LAND.\nTHEY WENT THROUGH THE PERMITTING PROCESS.\nTHE TRIBE SUED. THEY HAD ITS DAY IN COURT.\nTHEY LOST. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT?\n>> WHAT WE'VE SEEN REPEATEDLY HAPPEN TO THESE PEOPLE IS THEY\nHAVE MADE ONE TREATY IN 1851, 1861, AND EVER SINCE THEN THAT\nTREATY HAS BEEN VIOLATED. THAT LAND THAT THEY ARE TALKING\nABOUT, THAT EASEMENT, IS ACTUALLY TREATY LAND.\nTHAT IS OWNED BY THE NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE BASED ON THE\nSINGLE TREATY THEY MADE WITH THE UNITED STATES.\nTHAT TREATY SUPERSEDES ANY LAWS THAT THE STATE MIGHT MAKE LATER.\nAND SO TODAY OBAMA COULD LITERALLY -- COULD SAY THAT WE\nARE HONORING THE 1851 TREATY AND WE ARE NOT ALLOWING THAT\nEASEMENT TO BE TAKEN AS PRIVATE PROPERTY.\nTHAT'S BASICALLY AT THE CRUX OF THE ISSUE.\nTHAT EASEMENT THAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT AS PRIVATE\nPROPERTY, BASED ON THE 1851 TREATY, THE STANDING TREATY THAT\nTHESE PEOPLE MADE WITH THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT, IS INDIAN\nLAND, NATIVE AMERICAN LAND THAT BELONGS TO THE STANDING ROCK\nSIOUX RESERVATION, AND NATION. >> MARK RUFFALO, YOU GET\nINVOLVED IN A LOT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CAUSES, BUT HAVE\nYOU BEEN INVOLVED WITH NATIVE AMERICAN CAUSES BEFORE?\n>> YES. I STOOD SIDE BY SIDE WITH MY\nNATIVE BROTHERS AND SISTERS HERE WHEN WE WERE FIGHTING HYDRO\nFRACKING IN NEW YORK STATE. THE PIPELINE IS ABOUT TO MOVE\nTHROUGH NEW YORK STATE, AND WE'RE ALSO SETTING UP A CAMP\nJUST LIKE THIS ONE IN -- IN THE SIOUX COUNTRY.\nWHAT'S SIGNIFICANT THAT PEOPLE DON'T KNOW IS THAT THIS\nPARTICULAR ISSUE HAS BROUGHT TOGETHER 500 TRIBES FROM ALL\nOVER THE NATION. NEVER IN THE HISTORY OF OUR\nNATION HAVE ALL OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES COME TOGETHER\nUNDER ONE ISSUE. THEY SEE THIS AS A VERY SPECIAL,\nHISTORICAL MOMENT FOR THEM. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR\nTIME, MARK. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.\n>> LET ME TELL YOU, THERE ARE PEOPLE BEING REALLY HURT THERE.\nI HAVE BEEN ON THE PHONE ALL DAY WITH THEM.\nIT'S VERY SCARY. THESE PEOPLE ARE JUST LIKE US.\nWE CAN'T FORGET OUR HUMANITY IN THE FACE OF THESE KINDS OF\nTHINGS. YOU HAVE A CORPORATION AND A\nSTATE WHO IS WORKING ON BEHALF OF A CORPORATION TO HURT OUR\nPEOPLE. THEY'RE MILITARIZED.\nTHE NATIONAL GUARD HAS BEEN CALLED IN.\nI MEAN, THIS IS NOT AN EMERGENCY.\nTHIS IS NOT A NATIONAL EMERGENCY.\nTHESE ARE PEACEFUL PROTESTERS. THE STATE DEPARTMENT, THE\nDEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR, THE D.O.J., AND PRESIDENT OBAMA\nHIMSELF HAVE ASKED THEM TO VOLUNTARILY HALT ANY\nCONSTRUCTION UNTIL THIS CAN BE WORKED OUT IN A PEACEFUL MANNER.\nTHE GOVERNOR OF -- GOVERNOR DAL R\nOF NORTH DAKOTA.

LET'S GET SOME MORE WITH OUR\nPOLITICAL EXPERTS. WE'RE HERE WITH GLORIA BORGER.\nEVENTS LIKE THIS, THE STAR POWER OF MICHELLE OBAMA, IS THAT WHAT\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN NEEDS RIGHT NOW TO PREVENT COMPLACENCY?\n>> ABSOLUTELY. LET'S JUST SAY THAT MICHELLE\nOBAMA GETS THE SURROGATE OF THE YEAR AWARD, BECAUSE SHE CAN\nBRING OUT THE CROWDS. IT WAS A VERY BIG CROWD THERE\nTODAY. I THINK THE FIRST OR SECOND\nLARGEST OF THE YEAR. AND SHE NOT ONLY CAN GET PEOPLE\nMOTIVATED TO VOTE, BUT HER MESSAGE TODAY WAS VERY CLEAR.\nSHE SAID, THEY ARE TRYING TO CONVINCE YOU TO STAY HOME, THAT\nTHEY ARE -- THEIR STRATEGY IS TO MAKE THIS ELECTION SO UGLY THAT\nYOU WON'T WANT ANY PART OF IT. SO SHE KIND OF HIT THE VOTER\nSUPPRESSION ISSUE RIGHT ON THE HEAD, AND SAID TO VOTERS, IN\nTHAT IMPORTANT STATE, WHICH IS CLOSE, YOU CANNOT STAY HOME\nANYMORE, AND REMINDED PEOPLE THAT IN THE YEAR 2008, WHEN HER\nHUSBAND WON THAT STATE, IT WAS BY 14,000 VOTES, WHICH IS TWO\nPER DISTRICT. SO SHE CAN REALLY DRIVE THAT\nMESSAGE HOME. AND OTHER SURROGATES CAN DO THE\nSAME. IF HILLARY CLINTON DOESN'T GET\nTHEM ENTHUSED, THEY WILL TRY. >> WE'RE LOOKING AT A NEW POLL\nOUT TODAY FROM QUINNIPIAC IN NORTH CAROLINA.\nHILLARY CLINTON 47%, DONALD TRUMP 43%.\nGARY JOHNSON, 5%. IF THAT POLL IS ACCURATE, HOW\nDOES TRUMP CATCH UP? >> I THINK TRUMP IS REALLY JUST\nAT THIS POINT GOING TO HAVE TO EITHER STAY ON A COUPLE OF\nMESSAGES THAT SEEM TO RESONATE FOR HIM, LIKE THE OBAMA CARE\nPREMIUM NUMBERS, TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE CORE ISSUES THAT\nMATTER TO HIS VOTERS LIKE IMMIGRATION.\nIF HE GETS SIDETRACKED, I DON'T SEE HOW HE MAKES IT UP IN A\nNATIONAL POLL. I THINK HE'S GOT TO CONCENTRATE\nON THE SWING STATES. THE NATIONAL POLL NUMBERS ARE\nMEANING LESS AND LESS. >> HE WAS VERY DISCIPLINED TODAY\nIN SPEECHES SO FAR, WITH ANOTHER ONE COMING UP LATER IN OHIO.\nTWO OTHER INTRIGUING POLLS IN IOWA.\nHILLARY CLINTON 44%, TRUMP 44%. A MONTH AGO, HILLARY CLINTON WAS\nDOWN IN IOWA BY ABOUT SEVEN POINTS.\nAND IN GEORGIA, WHICH IS A TRADITIONALLY RED STATE IN A\nPRESIDENTIAL CONTEST, TRUMP 44%, HILLARY CLINTON 43%.\nSHE WAS DOWN SEVEN POINTS A MONTH AGO IN THE SAME POLL IN\nGEORGIA, AS WELL. IT LOOKS LIKE THAT'S A\nNARROWING, IF THERE'S A NARROWING IN GEORGIA OF ALL\nPLACES, TRUMP IS IN TROUBLE. >> RIGHT, ABSOLUTELY.\nWE HAVE SEEN IN THE NATIONAL POLLING A KIND OF RETURN TO THE\nMEAN A LITTLE BIT IN THE LAST FEW DAYS WITH THE NUMBERS COMING\nDOWN TO WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN. BUT BOTH OF THESE RESULTS SHOW\nTHE LIMITS OF THAT. THERE ARE TWO IMPORTANT POINTS.\nFIRST OF ALL, NEITHER OF THESE ARE STATES THAT HILLARY CLINTON\nHAS TO WIN IN ORDER TO WIN. THEY ARE STATES THAT DONALD\nTRUMP HAS TO WIN AND HE'S STRUGGLING IN THEM.\nTHE OTHER THING THAT'S STRUGGLING IS THESE ARE STATES\nIN EACH OF THE TWO -- IOWA IS PROBABLY THE RUST BELT SWING\nSTATE WHERE DONALD TRUMP HAS HAD THE BEST CHANCE.\nIT'S HEAVILY BLUE COLLAR, PREDOMINANTLY WHITE STATE.\nIF THE MARGIN FALLS THERE, HILLARY CLINTON IS AHEAD AMONG\nCOLLEGE WHITES, IT IS DIFFICULT FOR HIM IN THE OTHER RUST BELT\nSWING STATES THAT ARE LESS AMENABLE TO HIM.\nAND GEORGIA IS REALLY OUTSIDE OF THE BORDER OF WHAT WE THOUGHT\nOF. YOU HAVE NORTH CAROLINA,\nVIRGINIA, COLORADO, NEVADA AND FLORIDA.\nGEORGIA IS A STEP BEHIND. AND SHE'S UP 12 POINTS IN\nVIRGINIA IN THAT POLL. >> IT SEEMS THAT THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN STRATEGY IS TO SOMEHOW DECREASE -- FOR HILLARY CLINTON\nBY RAISING ALL THESE ISSUES, INCLUDING THESE WIKILEAKS\nE-MAILS THAT HAVE BEEN HACKED. >> THE STRATEGY DESCRIBED IN\nTHAT BLOOMBERG STORY IS LIKE VOTER DEPRESSION MORE THAN VOTER\nSUPPRESSION. THEY KNOW THINGS AREN'T GOING\nWELL. GEORGIA IS IN PLAY, THINGS ARE\nNOT GOING WELL IN TEXAS OF ALL PLACES.\nTHEY ARE DESPERATE AND LOOKING TO DO ANYTHING THEY CAN TO\nCHANGE THE TIDE. >> CAN THEY DO THAT, GLORIA?\n>> WE'LL HAVE TO SEE. I MEAN, I WAS TALKING TO\nSOMEBODY IN THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN TODAY WHO WAS SAYING LOOK, THEY\nDON'T EXPECT TO WIN GEORGIA. THEY REALLY DON'T.\nBUT THE QUESTION OF NORTH CAROLINA IS INTERESTING, BECAUSE\nWILL NORTH CAROLINA START TO LOOK MORE AND MORE LIKE THE\nSTATE OF VIRGINIA WHERE THEY'RE VERY MUCH AHEAD?\nYOU HAVE THE RESEARCH TRIANGLE. THERE ARE A LOT OF VOTERS THEY\nBELIEVE THAT THEY CAN APPEAL TO THERE.\nAND THAT IS A STATE THAT IS CHANGING, AND SO THEY'RE VERY\nINTERESTED, OF COURSE, BECAUSE THEY WANT TO WIN IT.\nBUT THEY'RE VERY INTERESTED IN THE TIGHTENING OF THE POLLS\nTHERE, VIS-A-VIE THE STATE OF VIRGINIA, WHICH ISN'T EVEN\nENDOWED ANYMORE. >> YEAH, IT'S BASICALLY THE\nSAME. IN ALL OF THE SUN BELT STATES,\nYOU SEE THE SAME COALITION CONSOLIDATING, ACCELERATING WHAT\nWE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST 16 YEARS SINCE 2000.\nIN VIRGINIA ALREADY, THE COMBINATION OF COLLEGE EDUCATED\nWHITES AND MINORITIES HAVE TIPPED THE STATE TO THE\nDEMOCRATS. HILLARY CLINTON IS UP DOUBLE\nDIGITS AMONG THE COLLEGE WHITES. IN NORTH CAROLINA IN THIS POLL,\nSHE'S BASICALLY EVEN AMONG COLLEGE WHITES.\nAND THAT IS ENOUGH TO GIVE HER A SLIGHT ADVANTAGE.\nBUT IT PUTS NORTH CAROLINA ON THE SAME CONTINUIUM THAT WE'VE\nSEEN IN VIRGINIA AND COLORADO. IF DEMOCRATS CAN SUSTAIN THAT\nTHROUGH THIS ELECTION AND BEYOND, IT TILTS THE ELECTORAL\nCOLLEGE MAP. GEORGIA AND ARIZONA ARE ONE STEP\nBEHIND WITH THE SAME DEMOGRAPHIC MIX.\nBUT JUST NOT QUITE AS MUCH DEMOCRATIC STRENGTH WITH COLLEGE\nWHITES YET. >> STAND BY, MUCH MORE COMING\nUP.

THIS IS OUR NEW CNN ELECTORAL\nMAP. SECRETARY CLINTON AT 272.\nDONALD TRUMP AT 179. HERE IS DIFFERENCE FROM JUST\nYESTERDAY. YESTERDAY WE HAD FLORIDA LEANING\nDEMOCRATIC AND NEVADA. WE'VE TAKEN THOSE OF WAY BECAUSE\nOF THE NEW POLLING THAT. DROPS CLINTON DOWN TO JUST ABOVE\n270. SO IF YOU THINK FOR TRUMP A HA.\nLET ME SHOW YOU NEW STATE POLLING OUT THIS EVENING THAT\nSAYS NOT SO FAST. DONALD TRUMP IS COUNTING ON\nIOWA. HE SAYS IN JUST ABOUT EVERY\nSALESPEOPLE HE'S WINNING IOWA. WELL HE'S NOT.\nIT IS A TIE ACCORDING TO THE NEW QUINNIPIAC UNIVERSITY POLL.\nAND THE POLL ALSO SHOWS THAT IN EARLY VOTING HILLARY CLINTON IS\nDOING QUITE WELL OUT IF IOWA. NOW LET'S MOVE SOUTH TO ANOTHER\nONE OF THESE RUBY RED STATES STILL IN PLAY.\nNOW GEORGIA. 44 FOR DONALD TRUMP, 43 FOR\nHILLARY CLINTON. SO STATISTICALLY A TIE IN\nGEORGIA OF ALL PLACES. AND AGAIN QUINNIPIAC FINDING IN\nITS POLLING HILLARY CLINTON DOING WELL IN EARLY VOTING.\nVIRGINIA, DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN SAYING FROM THE BEGINNING HE\nWANTS TO BRICK VIRGINIA HIS WAY. THIS IS YET ANOTHER POLL.\nFORGET ABOUT VIRGINIA. DOUBLE DIGIT LEAD, 50-38 FOR\nSECRETARY CLINTON. A ONCE RED STATE HAS BECOME A\nBLUE STATE. AND NOW NORTH CAROLINA WHERE\nSECRETARY CLINTON WAS WITH THE FIRST LADY TODAY.\nDONALD TRUMP CANNOT WIN WITHOUT NORTH CAROLINA.\nTHIS IS THE LATEST POLL TO SHOW YES A SMALL, 47-43 BUT A\nSTUBBORN PERSISTENT LEAD FOR CLINTON IN NORTH CAROLINA.\nTHE OTHER MAP WHAT'S THAT MEAN? YOU COULD TAKE AWAY IOWA AND\nCALL IT A TOSS UP. TAKE GEORGIA AWAY.\nTRUMP DOPS TO 157. EVEN IF HE WON ALL THE TOSS UPS,\nSTILL WOULDN'T BE ENOUGH. >> \"OUTFRONT\" CLINTON SUPPORTER\nBASIL SMIKLE. AND JEFFREY LORD.\nOUR EXECUTIVE EDITOR MARK PRESTON AND MAEVE RESTON.\nMARK, THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS SEIZING ON FLORIDA.\nTHEY HAVE ANOTHER POLL TONIGHT SHOWING HER LEAD CUT IN HALF IN\nJUST A FEW DAYS. AND NOW ON THIS MAP FLORIDA NOW,\nNO LONGER CLINTON GOING BACK INTO TOSS UP TERRITORY.\nTHAT IS A BIG POSITIVE. >> CERTAINLY IN A MONTH THAT'S\nBEEN REALLY BAD HEADLINES FOR TRUMP THIS IS A DIG POSITIVE FOR\nHIM. AND FLORIDA, HE NEEDS FLORIDA TO\nWIN. IT REALLY STARTS WITH FLORIDA AS\nWELL. IF HE LOSES FLORIDA EARLY ON\nELECTION NIGHT THE ELECTION IS OVER.\nHOWEVER AS WE'RE SEEING DOWN THERE WE'RE SEEING REPUBLICANS\nNOW STARTING TO COME HOME SO TO SPEAK.\nAND WE EXPECTED THIS BEFORE THE ELECTION ANYWAY.\nTHE REAL FIGHT NOW IS GOING TO BE FOR THOSE INDEPENDENT VOTERS.\nAND THE QUESTION WILL BE WILL WE SEE SPECIFICALLY IN FLORIDA SOME\nMARCO RUBIO SUPPORTERS, WILL THEY EVENTUALLY GO WITH TRUMP\nAND COULD TRUMP HELP MARCO RUBIO.\nSO THERE IS DYNAMICS GOING IN THAT STATE THAT ARE VERY VERY\nINTERESTING. >> AND MIKE PENCE IS SAYING\nHILLARY CLINTON GOT WAY TOO KOKKY.\nHERE IS HOW MIKE PENCE PUT IT. >> HILLARY CLINTON'S OUT THERE.\nWIDENING THE POLLS AND CAMPAIGNING FURTHER CANDIDATES\nAND THEN OOPS.

BUT WE CAN CANNOT BE COMPLACENT.\nAND THAT IS ACTUALLY THE POINT ABOUT INVESTING IN DOWN BALLOT\nRACES. IT IS ABOUT SUPPORTING ALL OF\nTHE CANDIDATES WHO ARE GOING TO GET OUT YOUR MESSAGE.\nAND I DON'T THINK DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO BE INVESTED IN THAT.\nPEOPLE ARE ALREADY VOTING IN VERY HIGH NUMBERS.\nSO THERE IS -- I DON'T WANT TO SAY WE'RE CONFIDENT BUT WE'RE\nCERTAINLY ENCOURAGED. I DON'T THINK QUESTION TAKE\nANYTHING FOR GRANTED THOUGH. >> TO THE EXTENT THEY HAVE BEEN\nDOING THIS ACTING THOMAS DEWEYESQUE HERE THAT THIS IS ALL\nOVER AND THEY ARE GOING TO WIDEN THE BATTLE FIELD.\nTHIS COULD BE A REAL PROBLEM. WHEN YOU GIVE PEOPLE THE IDEA\nYOU ALREADY HAVE IT IN THE BAG AND COMBINE IT WITH THE LACK OF\nENTH ENTHUSIASM.\n>> THOSE TAKEN TOGETHER COULD BE FATAL.\n>> LACK OF ENTHUSIASM, THAT IS NOT THE CASE.\nIF YOU GO THE NOIF HER RALLIES THERE IS NO LACK OF ENTHUSIASM\nTHERE.

AND THEY DON'T THAT.\nGOES TO THE POINT EARLIER WHETHER OR NOT REPUBLICANS ARE\nCOMING HOME. I DO WONDER ABOUT THAT.\nVOTERS MAY FORGET WHAT YOU SAY BUT THEY WON'T FORGET HOW YOU\nMADE THEM FEEL. AND WHEN YOU HAVE CANDIDATES\nRUNNING ON DOWN BALLOT RACES AND TRYING TO DEFEND DONALD TRUMP\nAND CAN'T REALLY DO A GOOD JOB OF THAT THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE A\nDIFFICULT TIME. >> AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK A LOT\nMORE ABOUT THAT. THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN DOES SEEM\nCONCERNED ABOUT THIS ISSUE. THEY SENT MICHELLE OBAMA WITHOUT\nQUESTION THE MOST POPULAR DEMOCRAT IN THE COUNTRY.\nTHE BEST SURROGATE HILLARY CLINTON HAS TO NORTH CAROLINA A\nSWING STATE TO STUMP FOR CLINTON AND HERE IS WHAT HE SHE SAID.\n>> LET'S NOT FORGET BACK IN 2012 BARACK ACTUALLY DID LOSE THE\nSTATE BY ABOUT 17 VOTES PER PRECINCT.\n17. THAT'S HOW PRESIDENTIAL\nELECTIONS GO. THEY ARE DECIDED ON A RAZORS\nEDGE. EACH OF YOU COULD SWING AN\nENTIRE PRECINCT AND WIN WHICH ELECTION FOR LIRL HILLARY.\nBUT YOU COULD ALSO HELP SWING AN ENTIRE PRECINCT FOR HILLARY'S\nOPPONENT, WITH A PROTEST VOTE OR BY NOT VOTING AT ALL.\n>> TRUMP SAYING HE DOES SO MANY RALLIES, HILLARY IS HOME\nSLEEPING. OBVIOUSLY HYPERBOLE HERE.\nBUT HE DOES DO MORE RALLIES. BE DOES SHE NEED TO STEP IT UP\nIN THE LAST FEW DAYS? >> WELL CLEARLY SHE'S HAD REALLY\nPOWERFUL SURROGATES LIKE MICHELLE OBAMA OUT THERE HITTING\nTHAT BIG PROBLEM THAT SHE HAS WHICH HAS BEEN ENERGIZING\nMILLENNIALS AND GETTING THE DEMOCRATS WHO WOULD POTENTIALLY\nVOTE FOR A THIRD PARTY CANDIDATE TO COME BACK TO HER.\nTHE CAMPAIGN CLEARLY IS WORRIED ABOUT THAT.\nYOU SAW ROBBIE MOOK POUT A VIDEO THIS MORNING SAYING HEY THE\nPOLLS ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE. NOBODY STAY HOME.\nSO THEY REALLY ARE DRIVING THIS MESSAGE THAT EVERYONE NEEDS TO\nTURN OUT. AND I WILL SAY THAT THERE IS SO\nMUCH VARIATION IN ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT POLLS THAT WE'RE\nSEEING THAT THE ONLY THING THAT IS SAFE TO LOOK AT REALLY IS\nTHE -- POLLS, NATIONALLY.

HAPPENED IN RAINY WINDY WEATHER.\nAPPARENTLY SKIDDED INTO A CONCRETE SUPPRESSIONABLE BED AT\nTHE END OF THE RUNWAY. THAT IS THE REASON NO ONE IS\nHURT. THE PLANE IS YOU HAVE TO RUNWAY\nIN THE CRGRASS. THE GOVERNOR HAS MOVED ON TO HIS\nHOTEL IN NEW YORK. DONALD TRUMP IS IN OHIO ARE\nHOLDING AN VENT TONIGHT. MEAN WHILE THE POLLS ARE\nTIGHTENING. WE'RE GOING BRING BOTH SIDES.\nFLORIDA AND NEVADA ARE BACK IN PLAY.\nSIGNS AS WELL THAT TRULY DEEPLY RED STATES ARE ACTING ALMOST\nBLUE. DAVID CHALIAN IS HERE WITH THE\nLATEST ON ALL OF IT. HE JOINS US NOW.\nLET'S TALK THE ROAD TO 270. THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT\nTHING. >> IT IS.\nAS YOU NOTED WE MADE A COUPLE OF CHANGES IN OUR BATTLEGROUND MAP.\nYOU SEE THAT NEVADA IS BACK IN BATTLEGROUND STATUS AND FLORIDA\nBACK IN BATTLEGROUND STATUS. JUST LAST WEEK WE MOVED THEM\nLEANING CLINTON. WHAT WE LOOK AT IS ADVERTISING\nBUDGETS OF THE CANDIDATE. THE MOST PRECIOUS RESOURCE THE\nCAMPAIGN CAN COMMIT IS THE TIME. SO WE LOOK AT TRAVEL SCHEDULES\nAND OF COURSE THE MOST RECENT POLLS.\nBEFORE HILLARY CLINTON EVEN WRAPPED UP HER TWO DAY FLORIDA\nSWING YESTERDAY HER CAMPAIGN ANNOUNCED SHE'LL BE BACK\nSATURDAY. AND THAT WON'T BE THE LAST TIME.\nNEVADA THEY ARE TIED. SO THOSE STATES HAVE SNAPPED\nBACK TO THEIR BATTLEGROUND STATUS.\nAND I JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU, THAT IS GOOD NEWS FOR DONALD\nTRUMP. HEY, THEY ARE NO LONGER LEANING\nCLINTON. BUT I WANT TO REMIND EVERYONE\nHOW TOUGH THIS MAP IS. LOOK WHERE WE ARE.\n281 TO 179. SHE'S ALREADY OVER THE THRESHOLD\nWITH STATES LEANING IN HER DIRECTION SOLIDLY.\nIF YOU WERE TO GIVE HIM EVERY REMAINING BATTLEGROUND STATE HE\nSTILL DOESN'T GET TO 270. HE ONLY GETS TO 264.\n>> WHAT WOULD HE HAVE TO DO? >> A FEW NEW POLLS OUT TODAY.\nSTARTING IN NORTH CAROLINA, WHERE HILLARY CLINTON WAS TODAY.\nSHE'S SHOWING A FOUR POINT EDGE. 47-43%.\nTHIS IS WHERE SHE WAS WITH MICHELLE OBAMA.\nTHIS IS THE STATE THEY WANT TO RECREATE THE OBAMA COMMISSION\nIN. SHE LOOKS TO HAVE AN EDGE.\nHERE IS ONE OF THE STATES THAT MIGHT BE ACTING DOWNRIGHT BLUE.\nWE'VE NOT SEEN GEORGIA GO DEMOCRATIC SINCE BILL CLINTON'S\nRACE. HE WASN'T EVEN ABLE TO HOLD IT\nIN HIS REELECT. AND CAN CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS NOT\nYET COMMITTED SURROGATE TRAVEL. HILLARY CLINTON IS NOT GOING\nTHERE YET. WE DON'T A SEE A TON OF SPENDING\nGOING ON IN GEORGIA. THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS NOT\nTREATING THAT LIKE A REALLY WINNABLE RACE FOR THEM.\nAND THEN IOWA, WHICH WE ALSO HAVE LEANING TOWARDS DONALD\nTRUMP, A DEAD HEAT. I WAS JUST LOOKING AT EARLY\nVOTING NUMBERS THERE AND HILLARY CLINTON DOES HAVE AN EDGE,\nDEMOCRATS HAVE AN EDGE IN TERMS OF RETURN BALLOTS BUT IT IS NOT\nAS BIG OF APP EDGE AS BARACK OBAMA AT THIS POINT YEARS AGO.\n>> GOOD NEWS FOR THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN BUT ALSO IMPORTANT GOOD\nNEWS FOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, PARTICULARLY IN FLORIDA AND\nNOVA. >> WITHOUT A DOUBT.\n>> LET'S BRING IN THE REST OF THE PANEL.\nVAN JONES IS WITH US. DAVID CHALIAN.\nTRUMP SUPPORTERS KAYLEIGH McENANY AND ANDRE BOWER.\nSO KAYLEIGH, YOU SEE THAT'S GOT TO BE GOOD NEWS FOR YOU, NEVADA\nAND FLORIDA IN PARTICULAR. >> ABSOLUTELY.\nWHAT IT SHOWS ME IS THAT THERE IS SOME MOMENTUM COMING IN\nTRUMP'S DIRECTION. AND I THINK THAT IS BECAUSE, YOU\nKNOW, WE WOKE UP MONDAY TO NEWS ABOUT OBAMACARE PREMIUMS HIKING.\nWE WAKE UP TODAY TO NEWS OF WIKILEAKS.\nMORE CLINTON KRUMGS OR WHAT APPEARS TO BE CLINTON CORRUPTION\nWITH THE FOUNDATION. FINALLY SOME OF THESE THINGS\nTHAT ANDRE AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ARE KIND OF\nBREAKING THROUGH THE NEWS CYCLE BECAUSE TRUMP'S NOT SAYING\nANYTHING THAT IS STEPPING ON HIS MESSAGE.\nHE'S GIVING IT BREATHING ROOM TO GET OUT THERE.\nTHIS MOMENTUM IS IMPORTANT AND IF DONALD TRUMP CAN STAY ON\nMESSAGE AND EMPHASIZE THINGS COMING OUT I THINK HE CAN MOVE\nTHAT MOMENTUM TO THE POINT OF WINNING THE ELECTION.\n>> CARLOS, DO YOU BELIEVE NEVADA AND FLORIDA ARE TIGHTENING\nBECAUSE OF THE DRIP DRIP OF WIKILEAKS AND OTHER THINGS LIKE\nSHE'S TALKING ABOUT? >> I THINK SHE'S RIGHT THAT\nTHERE'S BEEN A SHIFT IN CONVERSATION WHAT.\nSHE'S POINTING TO IS THE EARLY VOTING AND WHAT KAYLEIGH AND\nANDRE WOULD TELL YOU IS THERE ARE A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT THE 7\nOR 8 MILLION VOTES CAST SO FAR. BECAUSE IN MANY STATES HIBBERT\nIS DOING BETTER THAN BARACK OBAMA IN 2012 DID.\nAND IN NORTH CAROLINA AND ARIZONA, PLACES YOU NORMALLY\nWOULD HAVE SEEN MEANINGFUL REPUBLICAN LEAD THERE IS IEGT A\nSLIGHT DEMOCRATIC LEAD OR NARROW ARE REPUBLICAN GAP.\n-- >> ANDRE ARE YOU WORRIED?\n>> LOT OF VOLATILITY THERE BUT I READ TODAY THAT IN FACT THE\nREPUBLICANS HAVE TURNED OUT MORE PEOPLE TO VOTE EARLY THAN THE\nDEMOCRATS HAT. A SUBSTANTIAL MARGIN IN FLORIDA.\nSO THAT IS GOOD NEWS IF YOU ARE PULLING FOR TRUMP BUT AGAIN ALL\nALONG I TALKED ABOUT BREXIT AND HOW PEOPLE SHOWED UP AND TOOK\nTHEIR COUNTRY BACK. AND I THINK YOU ARE GOING TO SEE\nTHE SAME FOLKS THAT DON'T NORMALLY GET OUT AND VOTE.\nTHEY ARE NOT SHOWING IT ON POLLS.\nI GOT IN A CONGRESS RACE THIS SAME WAY.\nPOPPING EVERYBODY. I WON 13 WAYS BUT IN THE RUNOFF\nI GOT BEAT BECAUSE WE ONLY POLLED PEOPLE THAT 140ED UP THE\nFIRST TIME AND THE WHOLE NEW GROUP OF FOLKS CAME OUT IN THE\nRUNOFF. THAT IS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.\n>> DO WHERE HE HAVE DATA ON POLLING WHO'S ACTUALLY COMING\nOUT. >> THE EARLY VOTING.\nTHEIR VOTES AREN'T COUNTED UNTIL ELECTION DAY BUT WE CAN TELL IN\nSOME STATES WHERE IT IS BY PARTY BREAKDOWN THAT DEMOCRATS DO VAN\nEDGE IN EARLY AND ABSENTEE VOTE. WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT IS WE LOOK\nAT STATE BY STATE AND SEE ARE THEY OVERAPPROXIMATE MPERFORMIN\nOR UNDER PERFORMING WHAT OBAMA AND ROMNEY DID IN 2012.\nIT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER AS WE TALK ABOUT STATES TIGHTENING\nMORE. MOMENTUM THAT KAYLEIGH IS\nTALKING ABOUT. IT IS STALE VERY DAUNTING MAP\nFOR DONALD TRUMP. WE CAN'T FORGET THE PAST TO 270,\nAS I SHOWED HE HAS TO SWEEP EVERY BATTLEGROUND STATE AND\nTHEN SO A LITTLE BIT TO IN ORDER TO GET TO 270.\n>> VAN ARE YOU WORRIED? >> I'M SORRY, WHAT DID YOU SAY?\n[ LAUGHTER ] NO I'M NOT PARTICULARLY WORRIED\nTHOUGH I WILL SAY THIS. IF IT IS NOT ZERO PERCENT\nCHANCE, IT IS A CHANCE. AND I THINK ANDRE IS RIGHT.\nTHERE IS -- I WAS JUST IN PENNSYLVANIA.\nI WAS IN INDIANA. I WAS TALKING TO A LOT OF RED\nSTATE VOTERS. A LOT OF TRUMP VOTERS.\nAND THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO FEEL LIKE THIS IS DO OR DIE FOR THEIR\nCOUNTRY. AND WHEN YOU HAVE THAT LEVEL OF\nPASSION. WHETHER WE AGREE WITH IT OR NOT.\nPEOPLE WILL DO EXTRAORDINARY THINGS.\nAND SO IT IS NOT 0% CHANCE, WHICH MEANS THERE IS A CHANCE.\nSO I THINK DEMOCRATS SHOULD BE LESS HAPPY.\nLESS COMPLACENT AND I'M STRUGGLING TO GET THERE.\n>> DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THESE POLLS?\nBECAUSE ANDRE IS BRINGING UP BREXIT.\nTHOSE POLLS SHOWED THEY WEREN'T GOING TO VOTE BREAK AWAY.\n>> I THINK THAT IS A FALSE REALITY THERE WITH THE BREXIT.\n>> YOU THINK U.S. POLLS ARE BETTER THAN THE BRITISH POLLS?\n>> WELL IT IS JUST DIFFERENT. UK AND U.S. ARE TWO DIFFERENT --\nELECTORALLY IT IS TWO DIFFERENT. UK IS MAJORITY WHITE.\nWE ARE MUCH MORE DIVERSE COUNTRY AND I MEAN THERE IS JUST SO MANY\nTHINGS -- >> SO YOU HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE\nPOLLS SHOWING CLINTON. >> WELL HERE AND WHAT I WANT TO\nSAY. FLORIDA AND THE TWO STATES THAT\nWE'RE TALK ABOUT. FLORIDA, PUBLIC POLLING\nUNFORTUNATELY MISSES THE DEMOGRAPHICS WHERE AFRICAN\nAMERICAN NUMBERS SKYROCKETED AND LATINO AND CARIBBEAN AS WELL.\nTHE EARLY VOTING IN FLORIDA LATINOS ARE VOTING AT HIGH\nRECORD NUMBERS AND WHAT'S GOING TO DECIDE THIS RACE IS GOING TO\nBE THE I-4 CORRIDOR. EARLY VOTING I SHOULD SAY.\nI-4 CORRIDOR AND PUERTO RICRICA. DONALD TRUMP --.\nI THINK THAT IS THE KIND OF THE BREAKDOWN OF FLORIDA.\nNEVADA ON THE OTHER SIDE IS AT -- VOTER REGISTRATION FOR\nDEMOCRATS WE ARE AT 90,000 WHICH IS AT PAR WITH 2012.\nAND ALSO ANOTHER ADVANTAGE IS THE LATINO VOTE A WELL.\n>> WE GOT TO TAKE A BREAK. I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY ON THE\nPANEL. MICHELLE OBAMA'S GROUNDBREAKING\nROLE. ONE OF HILLARY CLINTON'S MOST\nPOTENT SURROGATES NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.\nWE'LL SHOW YOU WHAT HAPPENED ON THE ROAD TODAY.\nZ",

WHAT ARE YOU HEARING FROM THE\nDEMOCRATS ABOUT THEIR PLANS THERE?\n>> Reporter: YEAH, DON'T THE DEMOCRATS KNOW IT?\nI'VE BEEN TALKING TO PEOPLE FROM THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN, I TALKED\nTO THE HEAD OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HERE.\nTHIS IS AN ALL OUT GET OUT THE VOTE PUSH.\nYOU'RE SEEING JUST THE LAST COUPLE OF BUSES BUT THERE WERE\nDOZENS OF THEM HERE PACKED WITH PEOPLE WHO WERE INSIDE.\nYOU HEARD THAT MESSAGE FROM THE FIRST LADY.\nSHE IS SO EFFECTIVE AT THAT, AND BEFORE SHE TALKED ABOUT THE 17\nVOTES WHEN BARACK OBAMA WON IN -- LOST IN 2012 IS, SHE\nTALKED ABOUT WHEN HE WON IN 2008 BY JUST A LITTLE MORE THAN TWO\nVOTES PER PRECINCT. WHEN SHE SAID THAT, PEOPLE WHO\nWERE AROUND ME UP IN THE AUDIENCE LITERALLY GASPED.\nSO HER MESSAGE, THE MESSAGE FROM HILLARY CLINTON WAS VOTE THIS\nAFTERNOON. IF YOU'VE ALREADY VOTED, GET\nYOUR FRIENDS, YOUR NEIGHBORS TO GET OUT AND VOTE, AND THEY MADE\nA CASE FOR WHY IT MATTERS. AND SO WHAT THEY'RE HOPING IS\nTHAT PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THOSE BUSES HEARD IT LOUD AND CLEAR,\nBECAUSE THEY DO BELIEVE WITH A RACE THIS CLOSE FOR PRESIDENT, A\nRACE THIS CLOSE FOR GOVERNOR AND FOR SENATE ALL IN NORTH\nCAROLINA, THEY'VE GOT THIS TRIFECTA GOING, THEIR EFFORTS\nARE GOING TO BE THE DIFFERENCE HERE.\nNOW, OF COURSE, THEY WOKE UP LIKE THE REST OF THE COUNTRY DID\nTO THOSE HEADLINES ON BOTH THE \"WASHINGTON POST\" AND THE \"NEW\nYORK TIMES\" ABOUT QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE FORMER\nPRESIDENT BILL CLINTON ENRICHED HIMSELF FROM THE WIKILEAKS\nREVELATIONS THROUGH THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, SO I HAD A CHANCE TO\nTALK TO JIM PALMERI WHO IS THE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR OF THE\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN. HERE IS A LITTLE PART OF THAT\nCONVERSATION. >> I THINK THAT WITHIN THE PRESS\nCORPS IN PARTICULAR THERE IS A LOT OF INTEREST IN\nBEHIND-THE-SCENES STAFF INTRIGUE.\nSO WE UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT WE DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS SOMETHING\nVOTERS WILL FOCUS ON OR CARE ABOUT.\n>> IT DOESN'T PLAY INTO THE NARRATIVE OF THEM ENRICHING\nTHEMSELVES, PLAYING BY A DIFFERENT SET OF RULES?\n>> VOTERS ARE LOOKING BACK AT THIS ELECTION ABOUT WHAT IT'S\nREALLY ABOUT, WHICH IS IT'S AN EXISTENTIAL QUESTION ABOUT WHAT\nKIND OF COUNTRY WE WANT TO BE. >> Reporter: SO CERTAINLY AMONG\nTHE FAITHFUL, AT LEAST THE FOLKS THAT ARE HERE, BECAUSE I TALKED\nTO A LOT OF FOLKS IN LINE THIS MORNING.\nTHEY SAY STOP WITH TALKING ABOUT THE E-MAILS ALREADY, BUT IN MANY\nWAYS THAT'S PREACHING TO THE CHORUS.\nI THINK THE OTHER THING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT HERE IS SEEING\nTHE SYNERGY OF MESSAGE BETWEEN THE FIRST LADY AND BETWEEN\nHILLARY CLINTON. THEY TALKED A LOT ABOUT\nCHILDREN, HOW MUCH THIS ELECTION MATTERS TO CHILDREN.\nTHEY TALKED VERY MUCH TO THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN AUDIENCE HERE\nABOUT VOTING RIGHTS. THERE HAVE BEEN DISPUTES HERE,\nTHERE HAVE BEEN COURT CASES THIS YEAR ABOUT EARLY VOTING.\nSO THEY REALLY HAD A VERY HONED-IN, TARGETED MESSAGE TO\nTHIS AUDIENCE AGAIN, BECAUSE AS YOU POINTED OUT, STEVE, THEY\nKNOW HOW IMPORTANT NORTH CAROLINA HAS BECOME IN THIS\nELECTION CYCLE. >> ALL RIGHT, CHRIS JANSING DOWN\nTHERE IN WINSTON-SALEM, NORTH CAROLINA.\nCHRIS, THANKS FOR THAT. AGAIN, THAT QUESTION, NORTH\nCAROLINA. HILLARY CLINTON COULD BASICALLY\nSHUT THIS WHOLE THING DOWN IF SHE CAN WIN NORTH CAROLINA, AND\nGUESS WHAT, AS CHRIS WAS TELLING YOU, THE ELECTION IS ALREADY\nSTARTED THERE. PEOPLE ARE ALREADY VOTING.\nTHIS IS A HEAVY EARLY VOTING STATE.\nLET ME SHOW YOU WHAT INFORMATION WE HAVE FROM NORTH CAROLINA.\nSO SO FAR MORE THAN 600,000 VOTES HAVE BEEN CAST.\nWHAT DOES THAT MEAN? THAT IS ABOUT 15% OF THE TOTAL\nOF ALL OF THE VOTES THAT WERE CAST IN 2012.\nTHIS IS A STATE WHERE ABOUT HALF OF ALL THE VOTES IN 2012 END UP\nBEING CAST EARLY. WHAT DO YOU SEE HERE?\nTHERE IS A BIG ADVANTAGE FOR DEMOCRATS IN TERMS OF THE\nBALLOTS THAT HAVE BEEN CAST SO FAR.\nTHEY ARE COMING MUCH MORE THAN FROM REPUBLICANS AND FROM\nINDEPENDENTS. I GIVE YOU A COUPLE NOTES OF\nCAUTION HERE. OBVIOUS THIS WILL LOOKS LIKE A\nSIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nREMEMBER, WE SAW A BIG ADVANTAGE IN THE EARLY VOTING IN NORTH\nCAROLINA IN 2012 FOR BARACK OBAMA AND THE DEMOCRATS.\nREMEMBER, IN THE END, MITT ROMNEY DID END UP WINNING THAT STATE BY TWO POINTS.\nWHEN YOU SEE AN IMBALANCE LIKE THIS, WHEN YOU SEE ALL THE\nMUSCLE THAT DEMOCRATS ARE PUTTING INTO THE EARLY VOTE,\nDOES IT MEAN THEY ARE FINDING NEW PEOPLE WHO OTHERWISE\nWOULDN'T VOTE ON ELECTION DAY AND GETTING THEIR VOTES BANKED\nRIGHT NOW, OR DOES IT MEAN MORE THAT THEY'RE JUST TAKING PEOPLE\nWHO ARE DEFINITELY GOING TO VOTE ON ELECTION DAY AND GETTING THEM\nTO VOTE EARLY? ARE THEY GENERATING NEW VOTES OR\nARE THEY JUST CHANGING THE TIME FRAME IN WHICH PEOPLE VOTE?\nAS EARLY VOTING BECOMES A BIGGER AND BIGGER PART OF OUR NATIONAL\nELECTIONS, THAT'S ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT'S SORT OF OPEN\nOUT THERE. AGAIN, THESE ARE THE NUMBERS WE\nHAVE. SO FAR, NORTH CAROLINA A HEAVY\nEARLY VOTING STATE. TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THAT RACE\nIN NORTH CAROLINA NOW. SOMEONE WHO KNOWS THE STATE'S\nPOLITICS BETTER THAN ANYONE, JIM MOORE, EDITOR OF THE POLITICAL\nOBSERVER IN CHARLOTTE. LET ME ASK YOU THE BOTTOM LINE\nQUESTION HERE. DONALD TRUMP HAS TO WIN NORTH\nCAROLINA OR HIS CHANCE OF BEING PRESIDENT DISAPPEARS ON THE\nSPOT. WE SHOWED THE AVERAGE OF ALL\nPOLLS. IT HAS HIM DOWN A COUPLE POINTS\nAGAINST HILLARY CLINTON. REALISTICALLY, WHAT POSITION IS\nDONALD TRUMP IN IN NORTH CAROLINA RIGHT NOW?\n>> WELL, STEVE, I THINK IT'S STILL A VERY CLOSE RACE.\nTHERE WAS ANOTHER POLL THAT CAME OUT TODAY THAT SHOWED CLINTON UP\nBY FOUR POINTS. DESPITE ALL THAT, I THINK IT'S\nSTILL VERY CLOSE. THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN KIND OF A\nREPUBLICAN STATE. BARACK OBAMA WAS THE FIRST\nPRESIDENT IN 30 YEARS, I THINK, TO WIN THE STATE WHEN HE DID IT\nIN 2008. BUT IT'S VERY COMPETITIVE ALL\nTHE WAY AROUND, AND THE SENATE RACE, THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE AND\nTHE GOVERNOR'S RACE IS ALL VERY CLOSE.\n>> TALK ABOUT THAT SENATE RACE FOR A MOMENT IF YOU WOULD.\nTHE PERSONALITIES OF BURR AND ROSS MAY NOT BE KNOWN THAT MUCH,\nBUT IF BURR, THE REPUBLICAN INCUMBENT, GOES DOWN, THAT'S A\nPRETTY GOOD SIGN DEMOCRATS WILL GET THE SENATE.\nWHAT'S YOUR READ ON THAT ONE? >> YOU KNOW, THE LATEST POLLS\nI'VE SEEN SHOW BURR WITH A SLIGHT LEAD.\nAGAIN, ALL THESE RACES ARE CLOSE, BUT BURR HAS STAYED IN\nTHE LEAD PRETTY CONSISTENTLY WITH SOME BACK AND FORTH.\nI THINK IF SECRETARY CLINTON DOES WELL IN NORTH CAROLINA, AND\nLIKE YOU SAID, THERE IS A BIG PUSH TO GET OUT THE VOTE, A BIG\nPUSH FOR THE EARLY VOTE. DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO RING UP\nTHEIR NUMBERS IN THE EARLY VOTE, WHICH THEY'VE TRADITIONALLY WON\nIN NORTH CAROLINA, THEN THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR DEBRA ROSS.\n>> THAT SEEMS TO BE THE MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION, THIS EARLY VOTE\nFOR DEMOCRATS. DO YOU HAVE A SENSE IF THEY'RE\nGENERATING NEW VOTES WITH THE EMPHASIS ON THAT, OR IF THERE'S\nMORE MOVING PEOPLE WHO ARE DEFINITELY GOING TO VOTE ON\nELECTION DAY AND JUST GETTING THEM TO VOTE EARLIER?\n>> YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH.\nI THINK IT'S CERTAINLY SOME OF NEW REGISTRATION, BUT I THINK\nMORE THEY'RE PROBABLY IDENTIFYING WITH PEOPLE WHO THEY\nKNOW WOULD VOTE FOR SECRETARY CLINTON AND GETTING THOSE PEOPLE\nOUT. THEY'VE BEEN WORKING AT IT.\nTHEY HAVE MORE OF A GROUND GAME IN NORTH CAROLINA THAN THE\nREPUBLICANS DO. THEY'VE GOT OVER 30 OFFICES ON\nTHE GROUND. THEY'VE GOT A PRETTY BIG PAID\nSTAFF HERE, AND THE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT SLOW ON\nTHE UPTAKE ON THAT. >> JIM MOORE DOWN THERE IN NORTH\nCAROLINA. THE BIGGEST BATTLEGROUND GOING\nRIGHT NOW. THANK YOU FOR TAKING A FEW\nMINUTES.",

EARNEST HAS A HYPERPERSONALIZED\nUNDERWRITING PROCESS WHERE THEY LEND YOU MONEY.\nTHEY LOOK AT A LOT MORE THAN JUST YOUR CREDIT SCORE, AND\nTHEY'RE PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE HELPS THEM FIGURE OUT WHETHER OR\nNOT YOU'RE A GOOD CREDIT RISK. THE COMPANY HAS BEEN AROUND FOR\nTHREE YEARS AND THEY JUST LAST MONTH CROSSED THE BILLION DOLLAR\nLOAN MARK. I THINK THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE\nOF HOW THE ONLINE LENDING SPACE IS DRAGGING THE FINANCIAL SECTOR\nKICKING AND SCREAMING INTO THE 21 CENTURY.\nLET'S SIT DOWN WITH THE CO-FOUNDER AND CEO OF EARNEST TO\nHERE MORE ABOUT HIS COMPANY AND WHAT SETS THEM APART FROM BOTH\nTRADITIONAL BANKS AND THE PLETHORA OF ONLINE LENDERS THAT\nHAVE POPPED UP IN RECENT YEARS. GOOD TO SEE YOU, SIR.\nHAVE A SEAT. >> HI, JIM.\n>> THANK YOU. WE'VE HAD A COUPLE OF THE ONLINE\nLENDERS ON, AND CANDIDLY THEY HAVEN'T DONE THAT WELL.\nI WOULD SAY THAT EITHER HAD TROUBLE FINDING INVESTORS TO BUY\nTHEIR LOANS, OR THEY WERE SLOPPY UNDERWRITERS.\nHOW DO WE DISTINGUISH THAT FROM YOU?\n>> YEAH. I THINK THAT THE FIRST PART IS\nWHAT YOU WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT, SLOPPY UNDERWRITING.\nAT EARNEST, WHAT WE'RE DOING IS THE MOST THOROUGH UNDERWRITING\nOF ANYBODY IN THE BUSINESS, OFFLINE, ONLINE.\nTHE WAY WE DO THAT IS WE'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THE FULL\nFINANCIAL PROFILE OF ALL THE INDIVIDUALS.\nSO WE'RE LOOKING AT THEIR BANK ACCOUNTS.\nWE'RE LOOKING AT THEIR PAST DEBTS, BUT WE'RE ALSO DIVING\nINTO THEIR ASSET ACCOUNTS, AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NO ONE\nELSE IS DOING. AND WE'RE DOING IT BY CONNECTING\nDIRECTLY TO THEIR ONLINE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS.\n>> NOW, I WOULD PRESUME THAT A JPMORGAN, WELLS FARGO, COULD DO\nTHIS IF THEY WANTED TO? >> YEAH, I MEAN I THINK THAT\nWHEN YOU TALK ABOUT COULD HAVE, WOULD HAVE, SHOULD HAVE, LOTS OF\nCOMPANIES COULD TRY TO DO WHAT OTHER MORE INNOVATIVE COMPANIES\nARE DOING, BUT I THINK ULTIMATELY WE'RE TOTALLY\nVERTICALLY INTEGRATED. AND WE RETHOUGHT FROM FIRST\nPRINCIPLES HOW WOULD YOU ASSESS SOMEONE?\nSO THIS HAPPENED TO ME. I WAS GOING TO GRADUATE SCHOOL.\nIT DIDN'T REALLY MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME THAT YOU WEREN'T LOOKING\nAT ALL MY PAST JOB HISTORY, AND YOU WEREN'T LOOKING AT ALL OF\nTHE SAVINGS I HAD RIGHT AT THAT MOMENT IN TIME.\nAND IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE TRADITIONAL SYSTEM, THE\nTRADITIONAL SYSTEM KIND OF HAD BUILT UP THIS RELIANCE ON CREDIT\nBUREAUS. >> RIGHT.\n>> AND CREDIT BUREAUS ARE JUST MISSING CASH FLOW AND --\n>> YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT LIKE A FICO SCORE.\n>> EXACTLY. >> AS FAR AS YOU'RE CONCERNED,\nTHAT'S ALMOST AN ABSTRACTION. >> IT'S A SUBSET.\nIF YOU THINK ABOUT A BALANCE SHEET LIKE, YOU KNOW, THE\nBALANCE SHEET OF ANY CONSUMER, YOU KNOW, THE CREDIT SCORE, THE\nFICO IS JUST A SUMMATION OF THE LINES ON SOMEONE'S CREDIT BUREAU\nREPORT, BUT IT'S GOT LAGGING DATA, AND IT'S TOTALLY MISSING\nTHE OTHER SIDE OF THE BALANCE SHEET, WHICH IS THE ASSET SIDE.\nTHEN IT'S TOTALLY MISSING THE INCOME STATEMENT.\n>> EXCELLENT. PEOPLE WHO HAVE USED YOU, HOW\nMUCH MONEY HAVE THEY SAVED? >> SO THE AVERAGE BORROWER SAVES\nJUST UNDER $22,000. SO FOR THE BILLION DOLLARS OF\nLOANS THAT WE'VE DONE JUST OVER, IT'S $300 MILLION IN AGGREGATE\nTHAT WE'VE SAVE THE OUR CLIENTS. >> AND HOW MUCH MONEY IS EARNEST\nABLE TO MAKE? SOME BANKS WOULD SAY, LOOK, THEY\nMUST BE NOT -- THEY'RE TAKING A RISK BY NOT MAKING ENOUGH.\nWE HAVE TO MAKE UP ENOUGH SO THAT WE DON'T -- IF WE LOSE,\nWE'RE STILL OKAY. >> YEAH.\nI MEAN SO WE CHARGE VERY LOW INTEREST RATE.\nOVERALL, OUR INTEREST RATES ARE ABOUT 5%.\n>> MM-HMM. >> BUT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE\nREALLY GOOD AT, ONE, REDUCING OUR COSTS USING SOFTWARE AND\nOUGHT MAKE AS WELL AS REALLY ASSESSING THE RISK.\nSO, YOU KNOW, OVER THE WHOLE LIFE OF THE BUSINESS FOR A\nBILLION DOLLARS OF OUR STUDENT LOAN REFINANCING, WE'VE NEVER\nHAD A LOAN DEFAULT OUTSIDE OF THE RESULT OF ONE OF OUR\nBORROWERS PASSING AWAY? >> NEVER?\n>> MM-HMM. >> NEVER?\n>> NONE OF OUR STUDENT LOANS. >> THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY.\nWOW. ABOUT WELLS FARGO, IS THAT AN\nOPPORTUNITY FOR YOU? DO YOU THINK PEOPLE SAY, YOU\nKNOW WHAT, IF THE SO-CALLED GREATEST BANKS IN THE WORLD ARE\nDOING THIS STUFF, I AM WILLING TO VENTURE OUT AND GO TO A BANK\nTHAT IS NEW THAT I TRUST MORE THAN THE OLD?\n>> YEAH. I MEAN I THINK FINANCIAL\nSERVICES IN THE WHOLE HISTORY OF FINANCIAL SERVICES IS BUILT ON\nTRUST. BUT I THINK -- AND EVEN IN MANY\nWAYS, FINANCIAL SERVICES HAS BEEN BUILT ON INNOVATION.\nBUT I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE LARGER INCUMBENTS\nLIKE THIS WELLS FARGO EXAMPLE, THIS KIND OF CHASE FOR REVENUE\nAND CHASE FOR EARNINGS, THEY HAVE SEEMED TO HAVE LOST THEIR\nWAY. THIS IS I THINK JUST ANOTHER\nEXAMPLE. BUT, YOU KNOW, WHEN WE STARTED\nTHIS COMPANY THREE YEARS AGO, WE KNEW THERE WAS A HUGE\nOPPORTUNITY TO REALLY START OVER FROM SCRATCH AND BUILD SOMETHING\nBETTER. >> LAST QUESTION.\nI FIND IT INTRIGUING. YOU KEEP THE LOAN.\n>> YEAH. >> SO IF I GET IN TROUBLE, I\nACTUALLY CAN TALK TO SOMEONE? >> EXACTLY.\nWE ORIGINATE ALL THE LOANS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET, AND WE DO USE\nTHE SECURITIZATION MARKET TO FINANCE OUR BALANCE SHEET.\nBUT THEN WE DO ALL OF THE LOAN SERVICING FOR THE LIFE OF THE\nLOAN. SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S ALSO\nUNIQUE. LIKE I SAID, WE'RE TOTALLY\nVERTICALLY INTEGRATED. WE HAVE A MOBILE APP.\nWE HAVE A WEB DASHBOARD, AND WE'VE INNOVATED A LOT OF\nFEATURES. ONE OF THE FEATURES ON THE\nSERVICING SIDE IS A SKIP A PAY FEATURE.\nIF YOU'RE IN GOOD STANDING AND YOU'D LIKE TO TAKE A MONTH OFF,\nYOU CAN JUST SKIP A PAY. WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING,\nGOLDMAN SACHS JUST LAUNCHED THE NEW MARCUS, AND THAT'S ONE OF\nTHE FEATURES OF OURS THAT THEY'VE EMULATED.\n>> EXCELLENT. ANYWAY, I THINK IT'S VERY\nCREATIVE AND A GREAT SOLUTION FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON. THAT'S LIEU AS BYRL CO-FOUNDER\nAND CEO OF EARNEST. THANK YOU.\n>> THANK YOU.",

WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS BY\nTOMORROW. DOES THE SPIN IT OFF AGAIN.\n>> JACKIE KUCINICH. HE TWEETED ABOUT RIGGED\nELECTIONS. PEOPLE ARE NOT HAPPY, BIG LINES,\nWHAT IS GOING ON. WHY IS HE CONTINUING TO RAISE\nTHIS SPECTER OF POSSIBLY A RIGGED ELECTION?\n>> I MEAN, THE OTHER THING THAT HAPPENED TODAY, A POLL CAME OUT\nTHAT SHOWED HIM AHEAD BY THREE IN RED TEXAS.\nIT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY DEVELOPMENT.\nSO IT SEEMS LIKE HE IS TRYING TO HAVE AN EXCUSE FOR, NOT IF HE\nLOSES TEXAS, BUT IF HE LOSES IN GENERAL.\nIT'S HARD TO BELIEVE IN TEXAS WHERE THE WHOLE TOP OF THE\nGOVERNMENT, LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, GOVERNOR, SECRETARY.\nEVERYONE IS A REPUBLICAN, THAT SOMEHOW THEY'RE COLLUDING TO RIG\nTHE ELECTION FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\n>> LAYING OUT AN EXCUSE IN CASE HE DOESN'T WIN BY A BIG ENOUGH\nMARGIN OR WERE TO LOSE. >> IT COULDN'T BE BECAUSE OF\nDONALD TRUMP AND HIS MESSAGING AND THE DISASTROUS CAMPAIGN.\nHE HAS TO BE BECAUSE SOMEONE DID SOMETHING TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM\nHIM. >> NOBODY REALLY THINKS THAT A\nPRESIDENTIAL RACE AT LEAST THIS TIME AROUND THAT TEXAS IS AT\nPLAY. THE POLLS SHOW -- THREE POINTS.\nTHAT'S PRETTY CLOSE IN TEXAS. JASON CHAFFETZ, THE CONGRESSMAN\nFROM UTAH, HE RENOUNCED DONALD TRUMP AFTER THE \"ACCESS\nHOLLYWOOD\" VIDEO CAME OUT. NOW HE SAYS HE WILL BE VOTING\nFOR TRUMP, EVEN THOUGH HE IS NOT SUPPORTING HIM OR ENDORSING HIM.\nHE SAYS HE DOESN'T WANT HILLARY CLINTON TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE\nUNITED STATES. BUT IT'S A VERY SIGNIFICANT\nREVERSAL OF SORTS. >> IT'S PRETTY STUNNING.\nYOU'LL REMEMBER HE CAME OUT, AND HE WAS SO OUT IN FRONT ON THIS.\nHE SAID, I HAVE A 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, AFTER THAT TAPE CAME\nOUT. HE SAID HE COULDN'T ATTACH HIS\nGOOD NAME TO DONALD TRUMP. HERE HE IS JUST A COUPLE OF\nWEEKS LATER SAYING THAT HE IS GOING TO VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP\nBUT HE IS NOT GOING TO ENDORSE HIM.\nI THINK IT SHOWS YOU HOW DIFFICULT POLITICALLY THE\nSITUATION IS FOR A NUMBER OF THESE REPUBLICANS, BECAUSE SO\nMANY OF THEIR CONSTITUENTS HAVE SPENT YEARS AND YEARS -- HILLARY\nCLINTON, FOR THEM, REPRESENTS EVERYTHING THAT THEY DETEST\nABOUT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, SO THEY'RE REALLY STUCK BETWEEN A\nROCK AND A HARD PLACE HERE. AND HE SEEMS TO CLEARLY BE\nPROTECTING HIS RIGHT FLANK, BECAUSE HE ALSO CAME OUT AND\nSAID HE HAS TWO YEARS' WORTH OF MATERIAL READY TO GO IF HILLARY\nCLINTON IS PRESIDENT. >> IT'S A UNIQUE SITUATION,\nDAVID AXELROD, RIGHT NOW IN UTAH OF ALL PLACES, WHERE IT'S A\nPRETTY CLOSE RACE IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON.\n>> IT'S CLOSE IN PART BECAUSE THERE IS AN INDEPENDENT\nCANDIDATE, EVAN McMULLIN, WHO IS A MORMON, FORMER CIA AGENT, AND\nHE HAS BECOME A PROTEST VEHICLE FOR PARTICULARLY MORMON VOTERS\nIN THE STATE WHO ARE ALIENATED FROM TRUMP AND SOME OF HIS\nPERSONAL BEHAVIOR. SO I THINK THAT MAKES UTAH A\nUNIQUE PLACE. BUT THE FACT IS DONALD TRUMP IS\nBEHIND OR NO BETTER THAN EVEN IN EVERY BATTLEGROUND STATE, AND\nTHERE ARE NEW BATTLEGROUND STATES THAT WERE THOUGHT TO BE\nREPUBLICAN STRONGHOLDS. SO HE HAS HIS WORK CUT OUT FOR\nHIM. >> ONLY 12 DAYS TO GO.\nEVERYBODY STAY WITH US. WE'LL HAVE MUCH MORE WITH OUR\nPANEL COMING UP.

IN THIS FINAL STRETCH, THE\nCAMPAIGN IS SAYING THEY ARE GOING TO BE DEVOTING MOST OF\nTHEIR RESOURCES TO DIGITAL AND TV ADVERTISING WHILE THE RNC\nWILL BE WORKING ON GETTING OUT THE VOTE.\nTHEY SAY THEIR DOOR KNOCKING OPERATION IS EXCEEDING WHERE\nTHINGS WERE IN 2012. THEY ARE PREACHING A LOT OF\nCONFIDENCE AT THIS POINT. THE QUESTION, THOUGH, IS GOING\nTO COME DOWN TO TURNOUT, GETTING THIS CAMPAIGN TO GET ITS\nVOLUNTEERS TO THE POLLS, JUST SORT OF THAT GOOD OLD-FASHIONED\nPOLITICKING THAT WE HAD QUESTIONS ABOUT DURING THE\nPRIMARIES. REMEMBER WE ASKED THOSE\nQUESTIONS DURING THE PRIMARIES, IS DONALD TRUMP REALLY JUST A\nCAMPAIGN ABOUT HIMSELF AND SO FORTH, BUT HE SHOWED DURING\nTHOSE PRIMARIES THAT YES, THE BIG RALLIES CAN TRANSLATE IN\nGETTING PEOPLE TO THE POLLS AND THAT HE CAN REALLY RUN UP THE\nSCOREBOARD WHEN IT COMES TO ELECTION DAY.\nOF COURSE, ALL OF THAT IS GOING TO BE TESTED BECAUSE HE DOES NOT\nHAVE A COMPETITOR, DID NOT HAVE A CHALLENGER LIKE HE DOES RIGHT\nNOW IN HILLARY CLINTON. BUT HE'S GOING TO BE OUT HERE IN\nABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF FROM NOW.\nI THINK ONE OTHER BIG QUESTION, DOES DONALD TRUMP ADDRESS THESE\nLATEST ECONOMIC NUMBERS SHOWING 2.9% GROWTH IN THE THIRD QUARTER\nAS HE'S BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG THIS ECONOMY IS NOT DOING AS\nWELL AS IT SHOULD RIGHT NOW. DOES HE WEIGH IN ON THOSE\nNUMBERS WHEN HE COMES OUT HERE IN ABOUT 90 MINUTES FROM NOW.\n>> THOSE NUMBERS JUST OUT. WE WILL TALK ABOUT THEM IN A\nMINUTE. A LOT BETTER THAN A LOT OF\nECONOMISTS HAD PREDICTED. JIM ACOSTA, THANKS SO MUCH.\nWE ARE STILL A MONTH AWAY FROM THANKSGIVING BUT THIS MORNING\nTHERE'S A POLITICAL FLOAT SO BIG IT WON'T EVEN FIT IN THE MACY'S\nPARADE. REPORTS THAT SOMEHOW, JUST\nAPPEARED OUT OF NOWHERE THAT SHOULD SHE WIN, HILLARY CLINTON\nIS CONSIDERING JOE BIDEN AS SECRETARY OF STATE.\nTHE SAME JOE BIDEN WHO IS CURRENTLY THE VICE PRESIDENT.\n>> CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT ELISE LABOTT IS AT\nTHE STATE DEPARTMENT WATCHING ALL OF THIS.\nTALK TO US ABOUT THIS FLOAT. >> IF YOU REMEMBER, IN 2012,\nTHERE WERE THESE RUMORS THEY WERE GOING -- THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON AS SECRETARY OF STATE AND JOE BIDEN WERE GOING TO\nSWITCH JOBS. YOU ALWAYS HAVE THIS KIND OF\nSPECULATION WHEN THERE COMES TIME TO NAME A CABINET.\nCERTAINLY BOTH HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP ARE LOOKING TO\nPREPARE FOR THE INEVITABILITY OF BEING PRESIDENT, NAMING A\nCABINET AND SECRETARY OF STATE IS OBVIOUSLY ONE THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON'S GOING TO BE LOOKING AT VERY CLOSELY HAVING SERVED IN\nTHE JOB. SO POLITICAL REPORTING THIS\nMORNING THAT JOE BIDEN IS THE VERY TOP OF A SHORT LIST OF\nCANDIDATES FOR SECRETARY OF STATE.\nOUR REPORTING SUGGESTS HIS NAME IS BEING BANDIED ABOUT BY HER\nTRANSITION TEAM AS PART OF A VERY LONG LIST OF QUALIFIED\nCANDIDATES THAT COULD BE PRESENTED TO HER FOR SECRETARY\nOF STATE. NOTHING HAS BEEN PRESENTED TO\nHER YET. BUT THAT LIST RANGES FROM JOE\nBIDEN TO FORMER TOP STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS TO POSSIBLY\nEVEN SECRETARY KERRY HIMSELF STAYING IN THE JOB.\nSO NOT REALLY SURE THAT HE'S REALLY AT THE TOP OF THAT LIST.\nIT WOULDN'T PUT IT PAST SECRETARY CLINTON TO NAME\nSOMEONE OUT OF THE BOX AND CERTAINLY JOE BIDEN WOULD BE AN\nUNORTHODOX CANDIDATE, BUT HE DID SERVE AS CHAIRMAN OF THE FOREIGN\nRELATIONS, SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE, HAS HANDLED\nA LOT OF INTERNATIONAL ISSUES FOR THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION,\nBUT IF YOU LOOK BACK, HIM AND SECRETARY CLINTON HAVE DISAGREED\nON A LOT OF FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES RANGING FROM IRAQ,\nAFGHANISTAN, NOW THE WAR IN SYRIA.\nSO IT'S CERTAINLY A LOT OF FUN SPECULATION AND HIS NAME IS\nBEING BANDIED ABOUT AS SOMEONE THAT COULD DO THE JOB, BUT NOT\nSURE HE'S REALLY THE MOST LIKELY CANDIDATE.\n>> THAT'S RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.\nGREAT TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH.\nWITH US TO DISCUSS, MARY KATHERINE HAMM, POLITICAL\nCOMMENTATOR AND SENIOR WRITER FOR THE FEDERALIST.\nDEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST AND HILLARY CLINTON SUPPORTER, EMILY\nSISMAN, CAMPAIGN DIRECTOR FOR THE CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROCESS\nACTION FUND. JOHN PHILLIPS, DONALD TRUMP\nSUPPORTER AND ALEX BURN, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER AT\nTHE \"NEW YORK TIMES.\" THANKS FOR BEING HERE.\nEMILY, THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN OR SOMEONE WITHIN CLINTON LAND\nFLOATING JOE BIDEN AT THE TOP OF THE LIST POTENTIALLY FOR\nSECRETARY OF STATE. THIS SMELLS OF DELIBERATE.\nHM? >> POTENTIALLY.\nI DO THINK HE WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT CHOICE FOR HER.\nWHAT I THINK IT SHOWS BY HER PUTTING THE NAME OUT THERE,\nSOMEBODY IN CLINTON LAND PUTTING THE FAME OUT THERE, SHE'S\nSERIOUS ABOUT GOVERNING. IF YOU ARE JUST TRYING TO GET TO\nELECTION DAY AND JUST TRYING TO BRING PEOPLE OUT ON THE OTHER\nSIDE TO VOTE AGAINST THE OTHER CANDIDATE OR WHATEVER IS\nHAPPENING RIGHT NOW, THEN THEY WOULDN'T BE TALKING SERIOUSLY\nABOUT SOMEBODY TO RUN ONE OF THE MOST MAJOR CABINET POSTS WHO HAS\nA LONG HISTORY WORKING WITH BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE.\nPEOPLE REALLY RESPECT BIDEN WITHIN THE SENATE.\nHE HAS A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP. I THINK BY PUTTING A PINKY TOE\nOUT THERE OF INDICATING WHO SHE MAY BE POTENTIALLY LOOKING FOR\nFOR CABINET POST, IT SHOWS SHE'S VERY SERIOUS ABOUT GETTING\nTHINGS DONE AND ACTUALLY WORKING TOWARDS SOLUTIONS.\n>> ALL RIGHT. ALEX, VERY QUICKLY ON THIS\nSUBJECT, I THINK IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON FROM THIS FRLOAT, HOW\nMANY VOTERS DOES THIS SWAY? >> I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE ARE\nTHAT MANY. MAYBE IN DELAWARE THAT'S A BIG\nFLOAT. I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE ARE A\nLOT OF PEOPLE UNDECIDED WHO WILL SAY IF I COULD HAVE JOE BIDEN AS\nSECRETARY OF STATE I WILL VOTE FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nHAVING SAID THAT, I THINK IT SHOWS HOW MUCH THIS RACE HAS\nMOVED OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS FROM IF YOU THINK BACK TO THE\nBEGINNING OF THIS CAMPAIGN WE ALL THOUGHT THAT THE BIGGEST\nDANGER FOR HILLARY CLINTON WOULD BE GETTING PORTRAYED AS THE\nTHIRD TERM OF BARACK OBAMA. THE FACT JOE BIDEN IS IN THE MIX\nFOR A ROLE LIKE THIS, SHE'S REALLY STAKED HER CANDIDACY ON\nTHE IDEA OF FOUR MORE YEARS. >> OF COURSE, IT ONLY MATTERS IF\nSHE WINS. RIGHT?\nTHERE IS SOME NEW POLLING OUT TODAY, ABC NEWS WHICH IS DOING A\nDAILY TRACK, I'M OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER WHEN ABC NEWS AND \"THE\nWASHINGTON POST\" HAD HILLARY CLINTON UP BY 12 POINTS.\n>> EARLIER THIS WEEK. >> MONDAY.\nNOW IT'S FOUR. SO ALEX, THE QUESTION IS, HOW\nMUCH IS THEIR HAIR ON FIRE OVER THIS AND HOW MUCH SHOULD IT BE?\n>> IN THE BIG PICTURE, HILLARY CLINTON HAS HAD A PRETTY STEADY\nLEAD IN THE MID TO HIGH SINGLE DIGITS.\nA COUPLE OF THE POLL NUMBERS THAT HAD HER AT 10, 11, 12 POINT\nLEAD, THOSE WERE EYE-POPPING AND I THINK PROBABLY MAY HAVE BEEN\nOVERSTATED AT THE TIME. I KNOW TALKING TO THE CLINTON\nPEOPLE FROM LAST WEEK, THE LAST COUPLE DAYS, THEY HAVE ALWAYS\nANTICIPATED THAT THIS RACE WOULD TIGHTEN, THAT IF WE WERE TAKING\nTHE TEMPERATURE OF THE CAMPAIGN, REALLY AT A LOW POINT FOR DONALD\nTRUMP WHEN REPUBLICANS WERE JUST DESERTING HIS CANDIDACY IN\nDROVES, REPUBLICANS EVEN THEN HAD THE SENSE SOME OF THOSE\nVOTERS WOULD COME BACK INTO THE FOLD.\nI DON'T KNOW, WE STILL HAVEN'T SEEN A MAJOR NATIONAL POLL THAT\nSHOWS THIS EVEN AS A TOSS-UP RACE.\nI WOULDN'T NECESSARILY OVERREAD THE MOVEMENT OVER THE LAST\nCOUPLE DAYS. >> KIND OF A LITTLE TO YOUR\nPOINT, EVEN REPUBLICANS WILL SAY THIS IS A LITTLE BIT IF NOT A\nLOT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS OF REPUBLICANS COMING HOME.\nIF REPUBLICANS ARE COMING HOME, IF THIS IS WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE,\nWHAT'S BRINGING THEM HOME? >> LOOK, I THINK IT MAY BE JUST\nCOMING DOWN TO THE WIRE AND GETTING IN THE BOOTH AND BEING\nFACED WITH THIS DECISION. BY THE WAY, I THINK THE JOE\nBIDEN THING IS AS SIMPLE AS HAVING MICHELLE OBAMA ON THE\nTRAIL, HEY, YOU GUYS DON'T LIKE ME THIS MUCH, LET'S TALK ABOUT\nSOMEONE YOU DO LIKE, JOE BIDEN. I THINK IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.\nLOOK, I THINK THERE IS SOME COMING HOME BUT WHEN IT COMES TO\nTHESE INDIVIDUAL STATES LIKE FLORIDA WHICH HE REALLY HAS TO\nWIN, YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS LIKE 85% OF REPUBLICANS WITH HIM\nAS OPPOSED TO '92 WITH MITT ROMNEY, THERE'S GOT TO BE A LOT\nOF MOVEMENT THERE. THERE'S GOT TO BE A LOT OF\nMOVEMENT IN NOT THAT MUCH TIME WHEN AS WE HAVE HEARD OVER THE\nPAST COUPLE DAYS, HE'S NOT RAISING THAT MUCH MONEY OR\nSPENDING THAT MUCH MONEY OR THROWING THAT MUCH OF HIS OWN\nMONEY INTO THIS RACE WHEN HE RELIES ON THE RNC FOR GET OUT\nTHE VOTE. I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH OF THAT'S\nGOING TO HAPPEN IN THE LAST, WHAT, 11 DAYS HERE.\n>> AND VOTING HAS ACTUALLY ALREADY STARTED IN MOST MAJOR\nSWING STATES, IN ALMOST EVERY STATE PEOPLE ARE VOTING BY MAIL\nOR VOTING IN EARLY VOTE LOCATIONS.\nSO HOW MUCH PLACE DOES HE HAVE TO MOVE?\n>> SORRY TO CUT YOU OFF. MARY KATHERINE TALKING ABOUT\nREPUBLICANS COMING HOME BUT IF THEY ARE, THEY ARE SORT OF MAYBE\nLOCKING THE DOORS TO DONALD TRUMP A LITTLE BIT.\nBECAUSE THERE ARE THESE ADS OUT THERE NOW BEING FLOATED BY A\nREPUBLICAN SUPER PAC SPECIFICALLY SUGGESTING THAT\nHILLARY CLINTON IS GOING TO WIN AND YOU NEED TO ELECT THIS\nSENATOR OR CONGRESSMAN TO STAND UP.\nWATCH. >> NO ONE WOULD GIVE HILLARY A\nBLANK CHECK TO RUN UP TRILLIONS IN NEW DEBTS AND JOB-DESTROYING\nTAXES. >> ONE HILLARY IN WASHINGTON\nWOULD BE BAD ENOUGH. >> IT SEEMS MIXED MESSAGES.\nREPUBLICANS COMING HOME ON THE ONE HAND, IF YOU LOOK AT THE\nPOLLS BUT ON THE OTHER HAND SAYING WE THINK TRUMP'S DONE SO\nWE TRYING TO STAND UP TO HILLARY CLINTON.\n>> WELL, WE HAVE SEEN DIFFERENT DYNAMICS IN THIS RACE THAT IN\n2012 AND 2008, WHERE MITT ROMNEY DID VERY WELL IN THE DEEPLY RED\nSTATES. HE CLEANED BARACK OBAMA'S CLOCK\nIN TEXAS AND A LOT OF THE SOUTHERN STATES, PLACES LIKE\nUTAH, THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN WEST, BUT THEN LOST ALL OF THOSE\nPURPLE STATES THAT ARE UP FOR GRABS THIS TIME AROUND.\nIN 2016, TRUMP IS DOING MUCH WORSE THAN MITT ROMNEY IN PLACES\nLIKE UTAH, ARIZONA, TEXAS, ALTHOUGH I THINK HE WILL\nULTIMATELY END UP WINNING IN THOSE STATES, BUT HAS PERFORMED\nMUCH STRONGER IN THOSE PURPLE STATES, IN PLACES LIKE NORTH\nCAROLINA, OHIO, IOWA, THAN MITT ROMNEY AND JOHN McCAIN.\nSO IF YOU ARE A REPUBLICAN THAT'S RUNNING IN A RED STATE,\nTHEN THINGS ARE PROBABLY A LOT MORE TIGHT THIS TIME AROUND THAN\nTHEY WERE IN PREVIOUS YEARS. IN PURPLE STATES, I THINK THE\nTOP OF THE TICKET IS HELPING YOU MORE THAN IT HAS IN RECENT\nELECTIONS. >> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT?\n>> I THINK JOHN HAS A GOOD POINT ABOUT THE SHIFTING GEOGRAPHY OF\nTHE RACE. REPUBLICANS RUNNING FOR SENATE\nAND CONGRESS DON'T FEEL DONALD TRUMP IS LIFTING THEM UP IN\nPURPLE STATES. >> THEY THINKNOT, HS FOR LACK\nOF A BETTER TERM, TANKING THE TICKET AS MUCH AS THEY THOUGHT\nTHAT HE WOULD. REMEMBER, THOSE FEARS WERE\nRAMPANT IN THE PRIMARY. >> THE HOPE FOR REPUBLICAN HOUSE\nAND SENATE CANDIDATES FOR AWHILE NOW REALLY SINCE THE FIRST\nDEBATE OR MAYBE EVEN SINCE LABOR DAY HAS NOT BEEN THAT TRUMP\nWOULD WIN THIS ELECTION. REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN VERY\nPESSIMISTIC ABOUT THAT FOR MONTHS NOW.\nIT'S THAT HE WOULD LOSE NARROWLY AND NARROWLY ENOUGH SO THAT\nREPUBLICANS LIKE PAT TOOMEY RUNNING FOR RE-ELECTION IN\nPENNSYLVANIA OR THE CANDIDATES WHO WERE MENTIONED IN THE ADS,\nTHEY WOULD BE ABLE TO OUTPERFORM THE NATIONAL TICKET AND GET\nACROSS THE FINISH LINE. IF TRUMP LOSES BY FOUR INSTEAD\nOF 12 AND YOU HAVE THESE ADS OUT THERE TELLING VOTERS JUST MAKE\nSURE TO GET OUT THERE AND VOTE FOR A REPUBLICAN HOUSE AND\nSENATE CANDIDATES AS A CHECK ON THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT, THAT'S\nSORT OF THE BEST CASE SCENARIO, BEST CASE REALISTIC SCENARIO A\nLOT OF REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN IMAGINING.\n>> I BROUGHT UP THE MONEY. LET'S GET BACK TO THAT.\nHILLARY CLINTON GOT A LOT OF IT AND DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T.\nTHEN THERE'S THE ISSUE OF DONALD TRUMP SAID HE WOULD PUT $100\nMILLION OF HIS OWN MONEY INTO THE CAMPAIGN.\nHE HASN'T. HE'S GOT $56 MILLION.\nHE PUT $30,000 ONLY IN IN THE FIRST TWO WEEKS OF THIS MONTH.\nHILLARY CLINTON ACTUALLY PUT MORE OF HER OWN MONEY INTO HER\nCAMPAIGN. HIS KIDS HAVEN'T DONATED TO HIS\nCAMPAIGN. WHAT MESSAGE DOES THAT SOUND?\n>> TO MY LIBERAL FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES, IF YOU WANTED MONEY\nOUT OF POLITICS, WHO KNEW TRUMP WAS YOUR MAN.\nLOOK, THERE'S A HISTORIC LOW NUMBER OF TV ADS RUNNING,\nNEGATIVE ADS RUNNING ON TV BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T PUT MUCH\nMONEY INTO IT. THIS IS A VERY UNCONVENTIONAL\nRACE. YOU'RE RIGHT, THERE ARE PURPLE\nSTATES THAT TRHROW THE MAP INTO QUESTION BUT THE PROBLEM FOR\nREPUBLICANS HAS BEEN FOR SEVERAL CYCLES THE MAP IS TOUGH FOR\nTHEM. IT IS STILL TOUGH AND HE HAS TO\nNOT JUST WIN THE RED STATES THAT MITT ROMNEY AND McCAIN WON, BUT\nTURN SOME OF THE OTHER STATES. THERE'S PROMISE FOR DOING THAT\nBUT YOU HAVE TO RUN AN ALMOST PERFECT GAME AND TO LET THE\nBOTTOM FALL OUT OF FUND-RAISING WHEN YOU RELY ON THE RNC TO DO\nYOUR GET OUT THE VOTE BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE A CONVENTIONAL\nOPERATION, THAT'S A PROBLEM. YOU CAN'T RUN A PERFECT GAME\nTHAT WAY FOR THE NEXT 11 DAYS. >> NOT ONLY AN ALMOST PERFECT\nGAME. YOU HAVE TO RUN A PERFECT GAME\nIN ORDER TO RUN THE PATH HE HAS BEFORE HIM RIGHT NOW.\n>> YOU HAVE TO PLAY THE GAME. SOMETIMES TO PLAY THE GAME IT\nTAKES MONEY, RIGHT? YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING TO SPEND\nIT. >> YOU ALWAYS GET THE LAST WORD.\n>> YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M SORRY.\nI RETRACT MY COMMENT. STICK AROUND.\nA LOT MORE TO DISCUSS ABOUT MONEY, ABOUT OTHER THINGS AND\nALSO THIS. THE LAWYER WHO REPPED AL GORE IN\n2000 IS SAYING TO DONALD TRUMP SAVE YOUR BREATH, CHALLENGING AN\nELECTION IS NEAR IMPOSSIBLE.",

YOU'RE WATCHING CNN.\nBACK TO OUR BREAKING STORY ON THE FBI REOPENING ITS\nINVESTIGATION INTO HILLARY CLINTON'S PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER.\nLET'S GO STRAIGHT TO ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO IS RUNNING AGAINST\nHILLARY CLINTON. HE IS LIBERTARIAN PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATE GARY JOHNSON. GARY, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR\nJOINING US AGAIN. >> BROOKE, APPRECIATE YOU HAVING\nME ON. >> SO, SIR, I AM SURE YOU HAVE\nBEEN PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS BREAKING STORY AND THE NEWS FROM\nJAMES COMEY. YOUR REACTION?\n>> WELL, OBVIOUSLY THE FBI DIDN'T DO THIS LIGHTLY.\nTHERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING THERE BECAUSE YOU JUST DON'T DO THIS\n11 DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION KNOWING THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO\nBE ABLE TO CONCLUSION THE INVESTIGATION IN 11 DAYS AND\nTHEN SEPTEMBER WHEN THEY DROPPED THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION I\nTHINK THEY WERE MAKING A STATEMENT THEN THAT, LOOK, THEY\nDID NOT WANT A POTENTIAL PRESIDENT-ELECT TO BE UNDER\nCRIMINAL INVESTIGATION, BUT THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO NOW BE\nTHE CASE IF SHE IS ELECTED AND SHE WILL CONTROL THOSE JOBS THAT\nCONTROLS HOW THIS ISSUE MOVES FORWARD, WHICH POINTS TO A\nSPECIAL PROSECUTOR, REALLY OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A MESS.\nIT'S A MESS. FOUR MORE YEARS OF THIS --\n>> SO YOU SAY, GOVERNOR? >> AND I --\n>> GO AHEAD. >> I DO THINK TRUMP IS TOAST SO\nHILLARY MOVING FORWARD AS COLLECT, FOUR YEARS OF THIS?\nUGH. I'M HOPING I'M GIVING A --\n>> GOVERNOR, WHY DO YOU THINK -- SORRY, WHY DO YOU THINK --\nDONALD TRUMP HAS JUMPED ON THIS, THIS IS LIKE AN EARLY ELECTION\nDAY GIFT FOR THE REPUBLICANS, WHY DO YOU THINK DONALD TRUMP IS\nTOAST? >> ALL THE REVELATIONS ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP I JUST -- YOU KNOW I THINK PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO\nVOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP. I'VE BEEN SAYING, LOOK, DON'T\nVOTE FOR HILLARY CLINTON. I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF\nISSUES REGARDING THE THINGS SHE'S OPENLY TALKING ABOUT,\nGROWING GOVERNMENT, RAISING TAXES.\nI DO THINK THERE ARE REAL ISSUES WITH PAY TO PLAY, THESE\nWIKILEAKS SAYING ONE THING TO ONE GROUP AND ANOTHER THING --\nSAYING ONE THING TO WALL STREET AND ANOTHER THING TO MAIN S\nSTREET. TO ME BOTH SIDES -- IT DOESN'T\nCUT IT, EITHER SIDE. I THINK THERE'S AN HONORABLE\nALTERNATIVE, IT HAPPENS TO BE ME AND BILL WELD, TWO FORMER\nREPUBLICAN GOVERNORS THAT SERVED IN HEAVILY DEMOCRAT STATES.\nHEY, MAYBE WE WILL STILL OCCUPY THE WHITE HOUSE.\nMAYBE IT'S A POSSIBILITY HERE, WHAT DO YOU THINK?\n>> THAT'S FOR YOU, GAUCHE, TO GET TO FIGURE IT OUT.\nTHIS IS PERHAPS AN OPENING FOR YOU TO SEIZE UPON.\nIF THIS WERE HAPPEN TO YOU WITH 11 DAYS TO GO THE FBI REOPENING\nAN INVESTIGATION INTO YOUR PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER, HOW WOULD\nYOU HANDLE THIS? WE KNOW HILLARY CLINTON HAS TO\nRESPOND TO IT. HOW WOULD YOU?\n>> YOU KNOW, BROOKE, IT WOULD HAVEN'T GOTTEN THIS FAR IF WHAT\nI HAD DONE -- IF I HAD MADE A MISTAKE I'D HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY\nTRANSPARENT REGARDING THE MISTAKE AND IF IT ENDED UP TO\nBE, WELL, IN THIS CASE THE CONJECTURE IS THAT IT IS\nCRIMINAL, I'D LIKE TO THINK I WOULD HAVE NEVER ENGAGED IN\nANYTHING CRIMINAL, NEVER HAVING ENGAGED IN ANYTHING CRIMINAL IN\nMY LIFE, BUT THAT IT GETS TO THIS POINT RIGHT NOW, THERE'S\nREALLY NOTHING SHE CAN DO. THERE'S JUST GOING TO BE\nCONJECTURE OVER WHAT IT IS THE FBI HAS.\nTHEY'RE NOT GOING TO RELEASE WHAT IT IS THEY HAVE AND YET\nTHEY HAVE DONE THIS BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT\nTHERE AND IF THEY DON'T DO IT THEN THEY DON'T LIVE UP TO THEIR\nRESPONSIBILITIES AND THE JOBS THAT THEY HAVE TALKING ABOUT\nCOMEY AND LORETTA LYNCH. >> I DO THINK WE HAVE TO BE\nCAREFUL IN CONJECTURE. WE DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS\nCRIMINAL. THE PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS, THE\nCONCLUSION WAS NOT CRIMINAL, AGAIN, WE DON'T KNOW YET.\nTHERE'S UNFORTUNATELY SO MUCH, THINKING OF VOTERS, THAT WE\nDON'T KNOW WITH 11 DAYS TO GO. YOU MENTIONED WIKILEAKS,\nGOVERNOR. LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT -- AND THE\nDEMOCRATS WILL SAY IT'S RUSSIA WHO'S BEEN HACKING THE E-MAILS\nBUT SOME OF THIS, REALLY, THE CLINTONS' FOLKS HAVE NOT BEEN\nDISPUTING. THIS BLURRED LINE BETWEEN THE\nCLINTON FAMILY, LEARNING ABOUT THE TENS OF MILLIONS BILL\nCLINTON WAS RECEIVING ALL THE WHILE THEY WERE RAISING MONEY\nFOR THE CLINTON FOUNDATION. IF SHE WERE TO WIN THE WHITE\nHOUSE DO YOU THINK THE CLINTON FOUNDATION SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN?\n>> ABSOLUTELY. I MEAN, IT IS A CONFLICT OF\nINTEREST, IT'S PAY TO PLAY. THESE SPEAKING FEES WERE BEING\nPAID TO BILL AND FAVORS WERE BEING GRANTED, CRONY CAPITALISM\nIS WHEN GOVERNMENT PICKS WINNERS AND LOSERS, I THINK WHAT\nWIKILEAKS SHOWS IS THAT THE CLINTONS MAKE WINNERS AND\nLOSERS. YOU CAN PAY TO WIN AND\nGOVERNMENT DOESN'T NEED TO BE THAT WAY.\nTHE THAT'S THE OTHER THING I WOULD LIKE TO STRESS, IT DOESN'T\nHAVE TO BE THIS WAY. GOOD GOVERNMENT IS EASY, IT'S\nNOT HARD AND IT START WITH HONESTY AND TRANSPARENCY.\n>> YOU MENTIONED A SECOND AGO THAT THIS COULD BE AN OPENING\nFOR YOU AND FOR YOUR TICKET, YOU HAVE HAD YOUR OWN FAIR SHARE OF\nGAFFES, GOVERNOR, YOU HAVE BEEN SINKING IN THE POLLS.\nWHAT COULD THIS MEAN FOR YOU? >> WELL, WE'LL SEE.\nYOU KNOW, GAFFES ARE ONE THING, INTEGRITY IS ANOTHER THING.\nLIKE I -- THE PITCH WE CONTINUE TO MAKE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO GUESS\nWITH REGARD TO TWO FORMER GOVERNORS -- MYSELF AND BILL\nWELD -- WE DID SERVE TWO TERMS EACH IN HEAVILY DEMOCRAT STATES,\nWE WEREN'T WALL FLOWERS. WE WERE FISCALLY CONSERVATIVE,\nWE WERE SOCIALLY INCLUSIVE. WE'RE REALLY SKEPTICS WHEN IT\nCOMES TO MILITARY INTERVENTIONS REGIME CHANGE AND WE'D BE THE\nONLY FREE MARKET CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.\nWE'RE ON THE BALLOT IN ALL 50 STATES.\n>> INCLUDING RIGHT HERE IN FLORIDA.\nGARY JOHNSON, GOVERNOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JUMPING IN\nREACTING TO THE BREAKING NEWS, WE APPRECIATE IT.\n>> APPRECIATE YOU HAVING ME ON,",

THE COMPANY REPORTED A TWO CENT\nEARNINGS BEAT WITH IN LINE REVENUE UP 37% YEAR-OVER-YEAR.\nVERY BULLISH GUIDANCE FOR BOTH THE NEXT QUARTER AND THE FULL\nYEAR. MANAGEMENT TALKED ABOUT\nEXTREMELY VALUABLE NEW CLIENTS ON THE CONFERENCE CALL.\nYOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THE STOCK IS 7% HIGHER TODAY AND IT WAS\nEVEN HIGHER AT ONE POINT. LET'S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK WITH\nFRANK SLOOTMAN TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE QUARTER AND THE\nCOMPANY'S PROSPECTS. WELCOME BACK TO \"MAD MONEY.\"\n>> THANKS, JIM. IT'S GOING TO BE WITH YOU AGAIN.\n>> HOW CAN YOU ACCELERATE REVENUE GROWTH IN THIS\nENVIRONMENT? >> WELL, IT'S A FUNCTION OF US\nREALLY HITTING ON ALL CYLINDERS WHEN ALL OUR CHANNELS, ALL OUR\nGEOGRAPHIES, AND A LOT OF NEW PRODUCT SEGMENTS ARE ALL KICKING\nIN AT THE SAME TIME. YOU KNOW, YOU GO INTO OVERDRIVE\nAND YOU SORT OF SAW THE EFFECTS OF THAT.\n>> I SAW THERE WAS A CONTRACT IN FINANCE.\nI KNOW A LOT OF BANKS HAVE BEEN HOBBLED TOGETHER OVER TIME AND\nTHEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT KINDS OF -- ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF\nSYSTEMS ALL OVER THE PLACE. WAS THIS GIANT CONTRACT ONE OF\nTHOSE WHERE A BANK HAD MADE ACQUISITIONS OF OTHER BANKS AND\nTHEY REALLY FINALLY HAD TO GET IT TOGETHER?\n>> YES. TYPICALLY -- WELL, WHAT YOU SEE\nHERE IS THAT THESE VERY LARGE INSTITUTIONS ARE SITTING ON\nLARGE NUMBERS OF DISPARATE LEGACY SYSTEMS AND THEY'RE GOING\nTHROUGH A PROCESS WHERE THEY WANT TO MASSIVELY CONSOLIDATE\nAND STANDARDIZE ON A FRESH NEW PLATFORM.\n>> ALL RIGHT.  THE FIRST THING I SAY, WAIT A\nSECOND, WE HAVE A NEIL BUSH ON, AND WORK DAY IS SO GREAT AT HR,\nHOW CAN THEY BE GOING UP AGAINST SERVICENOW?\nYOU GUYS ARE ACTUALLY PARTNERS. CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW THAT\nPARTNERSHIP WORKS? >> YES.\nI MEAN WE'RE CUSTOMERS OF WORKDAY AS WELL, AND WORKDAY IS\nA CUSTOMER OF SERVICENOW, SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE A VERY GOOD VALUE\nADDED RELATIONSHIP. WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED ON\nPROCESSING THE WORK THAT COMES INTO HR ORGANIZATIONS, PEOPLE,\nEMPLOYEES AND LARGE COMPANIES HAVE A CONSTANT FLOW OF\nREQUESTS, ISSUES WITH PAYCHECKS AND SO ON.\nTHAT WORK FLOW IS RUN THROUGH SERVICENOW.\nSOMETIMES THAT RESULTS, INTERCHANGES INTO WORKDAY AS\nWELL IF IT'S A CHANGE OF ADDRESS OR A NEW MEMBER OF THE FAMILY,\nANYTHING THAT CHANGES THE ACTUAL RECORD, THAT GOES INTO WORKDAY.\nBUT WE TYPICALLY, OUR SYSTEMS ARE DEPLOYED ACROSS FUNCTIONAL\nBOUNDARIES. IN OTHER WORDS, WE'RE NOT JUST\nLAUNCHED TO SUPPORT HR. WE'RE ALSO LAUNCHED TO SUPPORT\nI.T. FACILITIES, LEGAL, AND MARKETS, AND LARGE ENTERPRISES\nWANT TO HAVE ONE SERVICE EXPERIENCE, NOT ONE UNIQUE TO\nEACH SERVICE AREA. >> BUT, FRANK, WOULD I KNOW THAT\nI'M INPUTTING A QUESTION TO SERVICENOW, OR WOULD I THINK I'M\nJUST INPUTTING A QUESTION TO THE COMPANY?\n>> THAT'S EXACTLY THE POINT. YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW\nWHO YOU'RE TALKING TO. >> INTERESTING.\nOKAY. NOW, YOU WANT A PIECE OF\nBUSINESS WITH A COMPANY THAT WE HAVE LONG FAVORED FOR ABOUT 140\nPOINTS, CONSTELLATION BRANDS. I KNOW IT'S A NEW PIECE OF\nBUSINESS SO WE DON'T HAVE TO GET INTO WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH THEM\nRIGHT NOW. BUT WHY WOULD THEY BE ATTRACTED\nTO SERVICENOW, AND WHO ELSE WOULD THEY BE THINKING OF DOING?\nWHY DO YOU WIN THAT BUSINESS? HOW COME YOU GET THAT CONTRACT?\n>> WELL, WE WIN FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS.\nBUT, YOU KNOW, TYPICALLY THERE'S A BIG MODERNIZATION EFFORT UNDER\nWAY WHERE, YOU KNOW, COMPANIES ARE TRYING TO CONSOLIDATE AND\nREFRESH IN TERMS OF ARCHITECTURE, IN TERMS OF\nPLATFORM, AND SET OURSELVES UP FOR 10, 15, 20 YEARS TO REALLY\nHAVE A PLATFORM THAT THEY CAN BUILD ON OVER THAT PERIOD OF\nTIME. AT THE SAME TIME, THEY'RE\nLOOKING FOR TRANSFORMATIONS. THEY WANT TO CHANGE THE SERVICE\nEXPERIENCE THAT THEY HISTORICALLY HAVE HAD, SOMETHING\nTHAT IS MUCH CLOSER TO THE CONSUMER EXPERIENCE THAT YOU GET\nIN ONLINE RETAILING, ONLINE BANKING, AND SO ON.\nAND THEN FINALLY, WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT REDEFINING THE\nECONOMICS, THE COST STRUCTURES. ORGANIZATIONS ARE ALWAYS LOOKING\nTO TAKE OUT BIG CHUNKS OF COST, AND THAT'S VERY MUCH CENTRAL TO\nTHE BIG INITIATIVES THAT WE DO WITH THESE COMPANIES.\n>> BUT YOU ALSO DEAL WITH COMPANIES TAKE LIKE A ZILLOW.\nWHEN IT WAS A SMALLER COMPANY, YOU PROBABLY DID A LOT OF THINGS\nON PAPER. WHEN IT'S MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE\nLOGGING IN EVERY SINGLE DAY, IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY.\nSO THEY WOULD BRING IN A SERVICENOW TO BE ABLE TO MAKE\nSURE THEY SEE CORRECT PATTERNS, KNOW IF THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG\nWITHIN THEIR ORGANIZATION? >> WELL, FIRST AND FOREMOST, WE\nGOT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ZILLOW INFRASTRUCTURE IS ALWAYS IN THE\nAIR AND AVAILABLE FOR THEIR END USER CLIENTELE.\nSO WE PLAY A VERY CRITICAL ROLE TO MAKING SURE THAT ZILLOW'S\nSERVICE EXPERIENCE IS AVAILABLE AND PERFORMS AND SO ON.\n>> ALL RIGHT. LAST QUESTION.\nDID YOU CHUCKLE WHEN YOU SAW THE E-MAIL THAT WAS RELEASED FROM\nCOLIN POWELL -- THEY ACTUALLY CRACKED HIS E-MAIL BOX -- WHICH\nSAID THAT YOU WERE A TARGET OF SALESFORCE?\nI KNOW THAT YOU AND MARK ARE FRIENDS, AND I DON'T THINK THERE\nWAS REALLY ANYTHING GOING ON AT ALL.\n>> YEAH, I DON'T THINK THAT MANY PEOPLE REALIZE, BUT, YOU KNOW,\nCEOs TALK. NOT JUST CEOs TALK, BUT\nEVERYBODY TALKS IN SILICON VALLEY.\nYOU KNOW, IT'S NOT ALWAYS ABOUT M&A.\nWE COMPARE NOTES ON MANY THINGS. IT'S VERY INFORMAL.\nALL COMPANIES MAINTAIN LISTS OF ASSETS THEY'RE INTERESTED IN.\nIT'S NOT QUITE AS EVENTFUL AS I THINK THE INDUSTRY OBSERVERS ARE\nMAKING IT OUT TO BE. >> ALL RIGHT.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH AND CONGRATULATIONS ON A GREAT\nQUARTER.

THE POINT I WANT TO DRIVE HOME\nWITH INVESTORS IS THAT THE MARKET IS LARGELY PRICED FOR A\nHILLARY WIN. YOU HAD NATE SILVER COME OUT\nSAYING, LOOK, THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT THERE IS STILL A\nNON-ZERO CHANCE THAT TRUMP COULD WIN.\nIT'S LOW, BUT NOT OUT OF THE REALM OF POSSIBILITY AT THIS\nPOINT. THE MARKETS ARE SIMPLY NOT\nPRICED FOR THAT. SO, I THINK THAT'S THE ONLY REAL\nTHREAT TO INVESTORS RIGHT NOW. >> WHAT DO WE DO THEN?\nIF IT'S ALREADY PRICED IN, A HILLARY WIN, HOW DO WE POSITION\nIN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS? DO WE DO ANYTHING AT ALL?\nHAS EVERYTHING BEEN DONE SO FAR? >> THERE ARE A FEW OTHER FACTORS\nTHAT WILL BE PUSHING THE MARKETS IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.\nSO I THINK THE HILLARY WIN COULD SET US UP FOR A RALLY, BUT TO\nTHE DEGREE IT'S ALREADY PRICED IN, THAT RALLY MIGHT BE MUTED.\nWHAT COULD HELP IS THAT WE'RE STARTING TO SEE OPTIMISM, UPWARD\nREVISIONS IN EARNINGS AND POTENTIALLY THE END OF THE\nEARNINGS SESSION. THAT COULD BE BENEFICIAL.\nWE ARE ALSO EXPECTING THE FED TO TAKE ONE HIKE.\nWILL THAT BE THE END OF THE WORLD?\nNO, BUT IT MEANS THE DOLLAR STRENGTHENED.\nTHE DOLLAR IS PUTTING PRESSURE ON EARNINGS.\nWE HAVE OPPOSING FORCES HERE. I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY\nYOU'LL SEE A RALLY, IT WILL BE A MUTED RALLY.\n>> I WAS THINKING WHETHER OR NOT WE STILL HAVE AN EARNINGS\nRECESSION. IT SEEMS NOW, AT LEAST WHEN\nLOOKING AT EUROPEAN COMPANIES REPORTING, THEY'RE SAYING THERE\nIS TRANSPARENCY IN 2017 AND WE HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT'S\nHAPPENING, OR CEOs WHO ARE SAYING WE'RE FINING IT MURKY\nSTILL AND DIFFICULT TO SEE THINK HOW 2017 WILL LOOK.\nIF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA AND CURRENT REVISIONS, THE REVISIONS\nARE TAKING US UP TO ABOUT A 2% GROWTH RATE IN EARNINGS, NOT\nGREAT, BUT STILL NOT NEGATIVE. ADDRESS YOU'VE SEEN OVER THE\nLAST FEW QUARTERS, WHILE WE'VE BEEN IN A RECESSION, WE'VE BEEN\nGETTING LESS AND LET'S NEGATIVE, A PRECURSOR TO POSITIVE.\nWE'VE BEEN MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.\nMOST OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE ENERGY SECTOR.\nTHE PROBLEM IS OIL CONTINUES IN ITS RANGE.\nWE'VE TRADED UP TO THE TOP OF THE RANGE, BROKE 50.\nUNLESS WE SEE SOME MAJOR NEWS OUT OF THIS OPEC MEETING, WHICH\nQUITE FRANKLY I DON'T ANTICIPATE, I THINK WE'LL LIKELY GET DISAPPOINTMENT AND TRADE\nBACK DOWN TO 40. I DON'T THINK OIL GOES ANYWHERE.\nTHAT PUT US IN THIS EARNINGS RECESSION.\n>> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS RECENT BOOST IN YIELDS?\nWHETHER IT'S IN EUROPE, IN THE GILT MARKET, TREASURIES.\n>> THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE DOLLAR AND THAT'S CONSISTENT\nWITH THE EXPECTATION THAT THE FED WILL RAISE RATES.\nNOW, PROBABLY NOT UNTIL FEBRUARY.\nPROBABLY ONLY ONCE AND IT WILL PROBABLY BE UP NINE MONTHS\nBEFORE ANOTHER HIKE. I THINK EVERYBODY IS TRYING TO\nEXIT OUT OF THIS EASY MONETARY POLICY AS SLOWLY AS POSSIBLE\nBECAUSE THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS IT HAS HAD TREMENDOUS\nIMPLICATIONS, ONE OF WHICH HAS BEEN TO BOOST PEs OVER THE LAST\nMANY YEARS. SO SOME OF THAT WILL BE TAKEN\nOFF THE TABLE. I WAS TALKING WITH A COLLEAGUE\nWHO SAID THE PERFECT SOLUTION FOR THE FED WOULD BE TO TAKE\nAWAY MONETARY POLICY AT THE POINT WHEN EARNINGS START TO\nREPAIR. IF YOU CAN DO THAT PERFECTLY,\nTHEN PE SHOULD MOVE SIDEWAYS. BUT THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE WHAT\nHAPPENS. >> SOUNDS EASY.\n>> YEAH. >> GINA, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nGINA SANCHEZ, CEO AFTER CHANTICO",

HE'S HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE WHERE\nHE FACES AN UPHILL BATTLE AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON.\nREPUBLICANS ARE IN A VERY TOUGH RE-ELECTION FIGHT WHEN IT COMES\nTO HOLDING ON TO THE SENATE SEAT KELLY AYOTTE HOLDS IN THE SENATE\nCURRENTLY. JOHN SUNUNU, FORMER GOVERNOR OF\nHIS STATE, BUT A LONGTIME REPUBLICAN VOICE OF THE STATE,\nWAS JUST UP ONSTAGE BEHIND ME AND REALLY SORT OF TWISTING\nELBOWS IN THIS ROOM. SAYING TO REPUBLICANS, IN THE\nSTATE, I KNOW SOME ARE RELUCTANT TO SUPPORT THIS NOMINEE.\nI KNOW SOME ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HIS RHETORIC BUT WE NEED YOU TO\nGET TO THE POLLS AND REMEMBER WHO HE'S RUNNING AGAIN.\nTHAT IS HILLARY CLINTON. SO INTERESTING CANDOR COMING\nFROM JOHN SUNUNU, A BIT OF AN UPHILL CLIMB AND HEADS OFF TO\nMAINE AFTER THIS. IN MAIN LETT ERMAINE LATER ON T\nAFTERNOON. THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN SAYS WE WOULD\nLIKE TO PEEL AWAY A VOTE IN MAINE TO GET CLOSER TO 270.\nIF YOU WIN A CONGRESSIONAL VOTE IN THAT SPLIT ELECTORAL SYSTEM\nYOU CAN GET AN ELECTORAL VOTE SHOWING YOU INSIDE THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN THEY KNOW THAT IS A VERY NARROW ELECTORAL PATH TO\nGET TO 270 ELECTORAL VOTES AND, YES, WORTH INVESTING THIS TIME\nTHIS LATE IN THE CAMPAIGN TO GO UP TO MAINE AND PURSUIT OF AN\nELECTORAL VOTE AND IOWA, HOLDING A SOLID LEAD.\nLATEST POLLS COMING IN, P.I. POLL AND OTHERS, SHOWS IT'S\nTIGHTENING THERE. AS DAYS ARE GETTING SHORTER, THE\nPRESSURE IS GETTING GREATER ON THIS CAMPAIGN TO TRY TO FIND\nTHAT PATH TO 270. MY GUESS IS, WOLF, WE'RE GOING\nTO HEAR THE SAME OLD DONALD TRUMP WE'VE BEEN HEARING OVER\nTHE LAST SEVERAL DAYS TOSSING OUT RED MEAT TO CROWDS.\nLAST NIGHT JOKED PERHAPS CANCEL THE ELECTION AND DECLARE DONALD\nTRUMP THE WINNER. HE IS KEEPING HIS SENSE OF HUMOR\nTHROUGH ALL OF THIS, BUT EXPECT THESE ATTACKS ON HILLARY CLINTON\nON OBAMA CARE, THAT SORT OF THING TO BE STEPPED UP HERE WHEN\nHE WALKS OUT. WE'RE HEARING HE'LL BE HERE\nSHORTLY. HOPEFULLY IN JUST A FEW MOMENTS,\nWOMAN. >> WE'LL STAND BY TO HEAR WHAT\nDONALD TRUMP HAS TO SAY TODAY. JIM ACOSTA, BACK TO YOU.\nHILLARY CLINTON LED EVERY SINGLE POLL OUT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE SINCE\nMAY, BUT WITH TRUMP STOPPING THERE SOON, WILL IT BE ENOUGH TO\nCHANGE THAT? LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT WITH OUR\nPANEL. WANNA SU\nWANNA -- JUANA SUMMERS AND GLORIA BORGER, CHIEF POLITICAL\nANALYST AND BRIANNA KEILAR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT.\nGLORIA, WHAT MESSAGE DOES TRUMP NEED TO SHARE WITH VOTERS IN NEW\nHAMPSHIRE RIGHT NOW? >> LOOK, I THINK HE NEEDS TO\nSTICK ON HIS MESSAGE. WHICH HE'S ACTUALLY BEEN DOING\nMORE THAN WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST.\nTHESE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS. HE'S GOT TO TALK ABOUT HILLARY\nCLINTON, WIKILEAKS, DRAINING THE SWAMP IN WASHINGTON, WHICH IS A\nMESSAGE THAT'S VERY RESONANT FOR HIM, THAT SHE IS THE STATUS QUO.\nTHAT HE REPRESENTS CHANGE, AND THAT, THAT IF YOU ELECT HILLARY\nCLINTON IT'S GOING TO BE MORE OF THE SAME.\nI THINK THESE HE'S GOING TO BE -- GOING TO BE TALKING UP\nWIKILEAKS, AND CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATIONS AND CONTINUING\nALONG THAT LINE. IF HE REVERTS BACK AND STARTS\nTALKING ABOUT HOW HE'S GOING TO SUE NBC FOR THE \"ACCESS\nHOLLYWOOD\" TAPE OR HOW HE'S GOING TO SUE THESE WOMEN WHO\nHAVE COME OUT AND ACCUSED HIM OF GROPING THEM, ET CETERA, THEN I\nTHINK HE'S TOTALLY GOING OFF THE RAILS AGAIN.\n>> JUANA, A LOT PEOPLE WONDER WHY ELECTORAL -- FOUR IS A SMALL\nNUMBER. IT WENT FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA BOTH\nIN 2008 AND 2012. AND ALL OF THE POLLS SINCE JUNE\nOR MAY HAVE BEEN SHOWING THAT DONALD TRUMP IS LOSING IN NEW\nHAMPSHIRE. SO WHY IS HE GOING THERE WITH\nONLY 11 DAYS TO GO? >> WOLF, YOU'RE RIGHT.\nA COUPLE DIFFERENT REASONS WHY THIS IS A STATE DONALD TRUMP\nCOULD PERHAPS DO WELL AND CLOSE IN THE MARGIN IF NOT WIN.\nFIRST OF ALL, LOOKING AT THIS FROM A SENTIMENTALITY ARGUMENT.\nTHE STATE THAT GAVE HIM HIS FIRST POLITICAL VICTORY.\nWON THAT PRETTY WELL AND THE STATE IS A STATE WITH OUT OF\nINDEPENDENT VOTERS TO SWAY. LOOK BACK TO 2012, INDEPENDENTS\nWERE ABOUT 40% OF VOTE IN THE 2011 AND BARACK OBAMA WON ABOUT\nFIVE PERCENTAGE POINTS. IT'S A SMALL STATE AND\nDEMOGRAPHICS THAT FAVORS DEMOCRATIC-MINDED CANDIDATES.\nI SEE AN OPENING IN THE DAYS AHEAD OF THE ELECTION PERHAPS\nDONALD TRUMP COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE THERE IF HE DOES WHAT\nGLORIA SAYS, STICKS TO THE SCRIPT, FOCUSING ON WHAT VOTERS\nCARE ABOUT INSTEAD OF THE EXTRANEOUS COMMENTS HE TENDS TO\nMAKE ON THE ROAD. >> HOLDS THESE RAILS, 10,000,\n20,000, 30,000 PEOPLE SHOW UP. IMPRESSIVE LONG LINES BUT\nREPORTERS HAVEN'T SEEN A LOT OF REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE\nSTAFFERS THERE AND OTHERS TO HELP THEM GET THE VOTE OUT,\nENCOURAGE THESE PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY NOT JUST SHOW UP AT A\nRALLY BUT GO AND VOTE. THIS IS A MISSED OPPORTUNITY,\nPOTENTIALLY? >> IT'S A SHAME FOR THEM AND TO\nGIVE PEOPLE A PERSPECTIVE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO GO TO A HILLARY\nCLINTON RALLY, I WALK IN AS A MEMBER OF MEDIA AND ASKED AT\nLEAST FIVE TIMES COMING AND GOING IF I AM REGISTERED TO\nVOTE. I SAY I'M HERE WITH THE MEDIA.\nOKAY. I GO ON MY WAY.\nBUT I'M ASKED OVER AND OVER. THAT'S THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT\nTHEY'RE DEALING WITH, AND IT JUST -- IT ISN'T ENOUGH TO HAVE\nENTHUSIASM. THERE'S THAT SAYING YOU CAN LEAD\nA HORSE TO WATER. YOU CAN'T MAKE HIM DRINK.\nHE'S MORE LIKELY TO DRINK IF YOU DO LEAD HIM TO WATER.\nYOU SGKNOW? THAT'S WHAT GETTING PEOPLE\nREGISTERED TO VOTE TO PLEDGE TO VOTE FOR HILLARY CLINTON OR\nDONALD TRUMP THEY'LL BENEFIT FROM.\nREPORTS OUT OF OHIO IN SOUTHERN AND EASTERN OHIO WILL DONALD\nTRUMP DID WELL IN PRIMARIES, VOTER REGISTRATION IS LAGGING.\nIT'S CRAZY IT'S -- NOT CRAZY BUT SORT OF IT MIGHT, YOU KNOW, PUT\nA HOLE IN HIS HERE TO THEY ENTHUSIASM IS ENOUGH JUST TO GET\nPEOPLE TO DO THIS ALL ON THEIR OWN.\n>> I REMEMBER TALKING TO FOLKS NOT TOO LONG AGO DOING SOMETHING\nABOUT MONDALE, AND WALTER MONDALE WHO RAN FOR THE\nPRESIDENCY, AND I WAS TOLD BY ONE OF HIS FORMER AIDES, WE HAD\nTHE LAST WEEK OF THE CAMPAIGN 30,000 PEOPLE AT OUR RALLIES,\nAND YOU'LL RECALL A LOSS OF -- DIDN'T GO WELL.\n>> GETTING EARLY INSIGHT INTO SOME OF THE EARLY VOTING IN\nIOWA, FOR EXAMPLE. QUINNIPIAC UNIVERSITY POLL\nSHOWING THAT 61% OF THE EARLY VOTERS IN IOWA HAVE CAST THEIR\nBALLOTS FOR HILLARY CLINTON. SO IS THIS A SIGN THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON IS JUST GETTING A LOT OF EARLY VOTES OUT THERE?\nOR IS THERE A TREND? SOMETHING GOING ON IN IOWA THAT\nMAYBE COULD BE SIGNIFICANT? >> WELL I DO THINK IT'S\nSIGNIFICANT A LOT OF THE EARLY VOTING SEEMS TO BE FAVORING\nCLINTON IN SOME OF THESE STATES. YOU SEE THAT IN NORTH CAROLINA\nAS WELL. BECAUSE ITS ENTHUSIASM, TURNOUT,\nALSO TAKING ATTENTION AWAY FROM THE CLOSE OF THE CAMPAIGN AND\nSHOWING AT THE TIME WHEN SHE WAS SURGING AHEAD OF TRUMP, SHE'S\nABLE TO CAPITALIZE THAT AND GET VOTERS TO THE POLL.\nENTHUSIASM AND SIMPLY WINNING. EARLIER THAN ELECTION DAY.\nI THINK THAT MATTERS. I THINK THAT DONALD TRUMP IS\nACTUALLY FAILING IN THIS RESPECT RIGHT NOW.\nLOOK, IF HE'S TIGHT AND CLOSE TO WINNING IN FLORIDA AND OHIO HE'S\nGOT TO BE FOCUSED ON THOSE. GET THOSE REPUBLICANS TO COME\nHOME. HE'S GOT TO SOUND AS MUCH LIKE A\nCONVENTIONAL AL REPUBLICAN AS POSSIBLE.\nHIS HARD-CORE RADICAL CHANGE IS A SUPPORTERS ARE BEHIND HIM.\nWRE WE KNOW THIS. HE NEEDS OTHERS.\nI CANNOT STAND HILLARY CLINTON. HE'S A REPUBLICAN AND I'M GOING\nTO SHOW UP AND VOTE FOR HIM, THEN HE HE HAS A CHANCE.\nSO MUCH WE CAN'T SEE. EARLY VOTING, LOOK BACK SAY\nTHAT'S WHEN HILLARY CLINTON REALLY CRUSHED HIM.\n>> PEOPLE MADE UP THEIR MINDS EASILY, TEND TO VOTE EARLY.\nAND SO YOU SEE THAT AMONG DEMOCRATS IN A LOT OF STATES,\nWHICH IS, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP NO MATTER\nWHAT. THE QUESTION IS, AS WE CONTINUE\nTHOSE LITTLE BIT OF WE ARE SUEDABLES, I'M NOT QUITE SURE\nHOW MANY OF LEFT, THEY'RE NOT VOTING EARLY.\nRIGHT? THEY'RE STILL THINKING WHAT\nTHEY'RE GOING TO DO, AN YOU WOULD RATHER VOTE AFTER THE\nDEBATES. >> OF COURSE.\n>> AND WHICH HE'S IN THE MIDDLE OF NOW BETWEEN WIKILEAKS,\nFOUNDATION QUESTIONS ABOUT HER HUSBAND AN SO FORTH.\n>> THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS A BETTER\nGROUND GAME ALL OVER THE COUNTRY IN THESE BATTLEGROUND STATES.\nAND A LOT MORE MONEY RIGHT NOW, WHICH WILL BE TRANSLATED\nPOTENTIALLY INTO VOTES? >> ABSOLUTELY.\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN RELY AND THE RNC FOR ON THE GROUND OPERATION\nHAVEN'T MOUNTED THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE SEE FROM A\nK CANDIDATE ON EITHER SIDE OF THE\nAISLE. THE MONEY RACE IS HUGE.\nHILLARY CLINTON OUT RAISED DONALD TRUMP IN THE FIRST THREE\nWEEKS OF OCTOBER. DOUBLED WHAT HE RAISED.\nCASH ON HAND, A TREMENDOUS ADVANTAGE.\nDONALD TRUMP FUELED ANOTHER $10 MILLION INTO HIS OWN CAMPAIGN\nGETTING HIM INTO THE $60 MILLION OUT OF THE $100 MILLION PLEDGED\nTO SPEND. LATE MONEY.\nMOST OF THE AIRWAVE TIME IS GOING BETWEEN THE CAMPAIGNS AND\nSUPER PACS. NOT A LOT TO DO THERE YET.\n>> BREAKING NEWS. I WANT TO BRING TO OUR VIEWERS\nRIGHT NOW, A NEW POSSIBLE INVESTIGATION BY THE FBI INTO\nHILLARY CLINTON'S E-MAILS. OUR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT EVAN\nPEREZ JOINS US WITH DETAILS. WHAT ARE YOU LEVING, EVAN?\n>> Reporter: WOLF THE FBI DIRECTOR JIM COMEY SENT A LETTER\nTO CONGRESS SAYING THE FBI IS TAKING A LOOK AT ANOTHER SET OF\nE-MAILS IT HADN'T PREVIOUSLY TAKE AN LOOK AT WHILE DOING ITS\nINVESTIGATION. YOU REMEMBER BACK IN JULY THE\nDIRECTOR OF THE FBI ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WERE RECOMMENDING NO\nCHARGES BE BROUGHT AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON IN THAT\nINVESTIGATION. HER USE OF A PRIVATE SERVER\nWHILE SECRETARY OF STATE DURING HER TENURE AS SECRETARY OF\nSTATE. THIS LETTER THAT COMEY HAS NOW\nSENT TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS SAYS THAT NEW E-MAILS HAVE NOW COME\nTO THE ATTENTION OF THE INVESTIGATIVE TEAM.\nTHIS IS A TEAM OF INVESTIGATORS IN THE COUNTERINTELLIGENCE\nDIVISION AT THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE FBI AND ARE NOW GOING TO\nTAKE A LOOK AT THESE E-MAILS. NOW, WE'RE TOLD THAT THE\nINVESTIGATORS ARE FNOW GOING TO SEE TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THESE\nADDITIONAL E-MAILS UNCOVERED CONTAIN CLASSIFIED INFORMATION\nAS WELL AS WHETHER TO ASSESS THEIR IMPORTANCE TO THIS\nINVESTIGATION, WOLF. THIS MEANS THAT THE\nINVESTIGATION WHICH WE THOUGHT WAS OVER WITH IS NOW BACK OPEN\nAND THE FBI IS TAKING ANOTHER LOOK TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT\nTHERE'S SOMETHING HERE FOR THEM TO PURSUE.\nOBVIOUSLY, THIS IS WHAT REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN CALLING\nFOR BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT THE INVESTIGATION WAS NOT DONE\nEXACTLY ACCORDING TO THE PROCEDURES THAT THE FBI USUALLY\nUSES IN THESE TYPES OF INVESTIGATIONS.\nSO NOW THIS IS ANOTHER WORRY FOR THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN AS WE COME\nTO THE CLOSING DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION.\nWOLF? >> SO BASICALLY I HEAR YOU\nSAYING, EVAN, THIS IS A LETTER FROM COMEY, THE FBI DIRECTOR, TO\nMEMBERS OF CONGRESS. HAS HILLARY CLINTON AND HER\nATTORNEYS, HAVE THEY BEEN SEPARATELY NOTIFIED ABOUT THIS\nPOTENTIAL NEW INVESTIGATION? >> Reporter: WE HAVEN'T HEARD\nYET FROM THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN WHETHER OR NOT THEY'VE BEEN\nNOTIFIED. THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE TRYING TO\nCHECK RIGHT NOW, WOLF. WE DO KNOW THAT THE FACT THAT\nTHE -- THE DIRECTOR OF THE FBI IS TELLING THIS TO MEMBERS OF\nCONGRESS, HE'S SIMPLY TRYING TO INFORM THEM BECAUSE HE TESTIFIED\nA NUMBER OF TIMES ALREADY IN CONGRESS THAT THIS INVESTIGATION\nWAS DONE PROPERLY. HE BELIEVES THAT THE FBI DID\nEVERYTHING IT COULD TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S WERE\nCHARGES APPROPRIATE IN THIS CASE AND THEY DECIDED THAT IT WAS\nNOT. THESE NEW E-MAILS THEY'VE\nUNCOVERED, HOWEVER, SEEMS TO INDICATE THERE'S MORE HERE FOR\nTHE FBI TO TAKE A LOOK AT, EXACTLY WHAT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS\nHAVE BEEN CALLING FOR AND, AGAIN, WHY HE SENT THIS LETTER.\nWE HAVE NOT YET HEARD FROM THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN WHETHER OR NOT\nTHIS MEANS NING TO THEM. AN IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT DAYS\nBEFORE THIS ELECTION. >> WE HAVE A PART OF THAT\nSTATEMENT FROM THE FBI DIRECTOR, JAMES COMEY.\nPUT IT UP ON THE SCREEN IF WE CAN.\nAMONG OTHER THINGS, HE WRITES THIS --\nIN CONNECTION WITH AN UNRELATED CASE, THE FBI HAS LEARNED OF THE\nEXISTENCE OF E-MAILS THAT APPEAR TO BE PERTINENT TO THE\nINVESTIGATION. I AGREED THAT THE FBI SHOULD\nTAKE APPROPRIATE INVESTIGATIVE STEPS DESIGNED TO ALLOW\nINVESTIGATORS TO REVIEW THOSE E-MAILS TO DETERMINE WHETHER\nTHEY CONTAIN CLASSIFIED INFORMATION AS WELL AS TO ASSESS\nTHEIR IMPORTANCE TO OUR INVESTIGATION.\nSO THIS STATEMENT FROM THE FBI DIRECTOR, EVAN SAYS THAT THEY\nWERE WORKING ON OTHER UNREPRESENTED CASES AND ALL OF A\nSUDDEN CAME UPON SOME HILLARY CLINTON-REPRESENTED E-MAILS THAT\nMAY HAVE CONTAINED CLASSIFIED INFORMATION, AND NOW THAT'S WHY\nTHEY'RE REOPENING THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE HILLARY\nCLINTON E-MAIL ISSUE? >> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT, WOLF.\nTHAT'S RIGHT. GOING TO LOOK AT THESE E-MAILS\nAND ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE IS WHAT EXACTLY\nWHAT INVESTIGATION THAT IS? WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT THAT\nINVESTIGATION THAT UNRELATED INVESTIGATION.\nWE'RE TOLD BY SOURCES THAT WE'VE TALKED TO THAT IT DOES NOT\nRELATE TO THE ONGOING WIKILEAKS INVESTIGATION.\nAS YOU KNOW, THOSE WIKILEAKS E-MAILS, THOSE E-MAILS HACKED BY\nTHE RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICES ACCORDING TO U.S.\nINTELLIGENCE, AND HAVE NOW BEEN RELEASED BY WIKILEAKS RAISED NEW\nQUESTIONS ABOUT CLINTON AND HER CONDUCT THERE DURING THE --\nDURING HER TENURE AS SECRETARY OF STATE AS WELL AS DURING HER\nCAMPAIGN HERE. SO THE QUESTION HAS BEEN WHETHER\nOR NOT THIS IS SOMETHING THE FBI SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT.\nWE'RE TOLD THIS IS NOT RELATED TO THE WIKILEAKS INVESTIGATION.\nIT'S ALSO NOT RELATED TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, WHICH AS YOU\nKNOW, WOLF, THE FBI HAS TAKEN A LOOK AT IN THE PAST.\nTHAT INVESTIGATION IS STILL SOMETHING THAT IS, IN THE\nBACKGROUND OF ALL OF THIS. >> WE KNOW FBI INVESTIGATIONS\nTAKE A WHILE. QUICKLY, EVAN, I SUSPECT NOTHING\nIS GOING TO EMERGE UNLESS THERE ARE LEAKS AND PRESUMABLY THERE\nCOULD BE OVER THE NEXT 11 DAYS OR SO BEFORE THE U.S. ELECTION.\nRIGHT? >> Reporter: RIGHT.\nTHE FBI DIRECTOR SAYS HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW LONG THIS IS GOING TO\nTAKE. I ANTICIPATE, WOLF, THAT WE'RE\nNOT GOING TO KNOW THE ANSWER UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION.\n>> EVAN PEREZ, OUR JUSTICE KE\nCORRESPONDENT. BACK TO THE PANEL.\nGLORIA, POTENTIALLY ANOTHER WORRISOME DEVELOPMENT FOR THE\nHILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN. THE TIMING, RATHER AWKWARD.\n>> I'D SAY SO, AND WE WERE JUST TALKING EARLIER WHAT DONALD\nTRUMP SHOULD TALK ABOUT TODAY. I THINK THIS.\nWHILE THIS LETTER DOES SAY, WOULD OF, FROM COMEY WE CANNOT\nASSESS WEHETHER THIS MATERIAL MY BE SIGNIFICANT AND I ALSO CAN'T\nSAY HOW LONG IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO COMPLETE, IT'S VERY CLEAR\nTHAT IT IS SIGNIFICANT POLITICALLY.\nTHAT -- THAT DONALD TRUMP CAN SAY MORE OF THE SAME.\nTHEY HAVE REOPENED AN INVESTIGATION THAT THEY CLOSED\nOR SO THEY THOUGHT, IN JULY LAST SUMMER, AND HE CAN GO TO THE, TO\nTHE CORRUPTION ANGLE WITH HILLARY CLINTON.\nI MEAN, WE -- YOU KNOW, AS EVAN WAS JUST SAYING, THERE'S MORE WE\nDON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS THAN WE KNOW.\nTHEY'VE COME ACROSS SOMETHING THAT MAY POTENTIALLY BE\nSIGNIFICANT, BUT THEY HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA.\nPUTS HILLARY CLINTON IN A VERY DIFFICULT SPOT.\nWITH THE WIKILEAKS HACK, THEY CAN JUST NOT ANSWER QUESTIONS\nAND SAY, OH, THAT'S THE RESULT OF THE RUSSIAN, AND THEY'RE NOT\nANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT.\nTHIS, I THINK THEY DO HAVE TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS, AND CAN'T\nJUST PUSH IT ASIDE, AND IF I WERE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, THIS IS\nWHAT I WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY.\n>> BRIANNA, YOU AND I, ALL OF US, KNOW HOW WASHINGTON WORKS.\nIF THERE'S SOMETHING THERE, IT'S GOING TO LEAK, COME OUT QUICKLY\nAND THAT'S GOING TO BE A PROBLEM POTENTIALLY FOR THE HILLARY\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN. >> CERTAINLY IS.\nEVEN THE IDEA THAT THIS IS BEING LOOKED AT AGAIN IS SOMETHING\nTHAT IS DAMAGING. YOU REMEMBER HILLARY CLINTON\nSAID THAT BASICALLY WHAT SHE SAID WAS FBI DIRECTOR COMEY SAID\nI DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG. I'M PARAPHRASING.\nTHAT'S NOT WHAT HE SAID. WHAT HE SAID WAS SHE AND HER\nAIDES WERE RECKLESS IN THE HANDLING OF E-MAILS AND ON THIS\nSERVER, BUT EVEN NOW SHE CERTAINLY FEELS LIKE SHE DIDN'T\nDO ANYTHING WRONG. BUT IT'S NOT REALLY AN ARGUMENT,\nSHE CAN'T GO AS FAR AS BEFORE. YOU KNOW?\nNOW IT'S UP IN THE AIR. IT'S -- IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS\nYOU HEAR THEM SAY IS SORT OF THAT'S OVER AND DONE WITH.\nWE'VE MOVED ON. RIGHT?\nTHAT'S BEEN PUT TO BED. YOU CAN'T SAY THAT.\n>> NOW INVESTIGATING AGAIN AND SAYS AT THE END OF HIS LETTER,\nDAVID, ALTHOUGH THE FBI CANNOT YET ASSESS WHETHER OR NOT THIS\nMATERIAL MAY BE SIGNIFICANT AND I CANNOT PREDICT HOW LONG IT\nWILL TAKE US TO COMPLETE THIS ADDITIONAL WORK I BELIEVE IT IS\nIMPORTANT TO UPDATE YOUR COMMITTEES ABOUT OUR EFFORTS IN\nLIGHT OF MY PREVIOUS TESTIMONY. THAT SORT OF SOUNDS A BIT\nOMINOUS. >> WELL, WE'LL SEE WHAT IT IS.\nI MEAN, WHAT I THINK IS STRIKING IS, THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT\nTHERE'S POLITICAL FALLOUT FROM THIS, BECAUSE IT'S STILL A\nPOLITICAL FOOTBALL. WHAT IS ALSO STRIKING IS THE\nEXTENT TO WHICH THE FBI DIRECTOR OF THE UNITED STATES IS ALLOWING\nHIMSELF TO BE INTERJECTED INTO THIS POLITICAL CAMPAIGN.\nUNPRECEDENTED THAT HE WOULD HAVE RELEASED THE INFORMATION HE\nRELEASED AFTER A DECISION NOT TO RECOMMEND INDICTMENT.\nYOU JUST DON'T SEE THAT DONE EVER, AND NOW HE IS VERY\nPUBLICLY EXCHANGES INFORMATION WITH COMMITTEES BENT ON KEEPING\nTHESE INVESTIGATIONS ALIVE, AND ALSO STRIKING, THE SILENCE OF\nTHE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES WHO HAS RENDERED A\nJUDGMENT FLOT TO PER SUE ANYTHING CRIMINAL.\nTHE POLITICIZATION OF THESE TWO ROLES WILL EXTEND FAR PAST --\n>> HE'S COME UNDER ENORMOUS CRITICISM FROM REPUBLICANS.\n>> HE HAS, WHO FELT THE CLINTON WERE ESSENTIALLY A CRIMINAL\nENTERPRISE AND FBI AGENTS WHO LEAK THIS INFORMATION, WANT\nHILLARY CLINTON CHARGED WITH A CRIME.\nHAS SAID NOBODY WOULD HAVE BROUGHT SUCH A CLOSE.\nNOT EVE AN CLOSE CALL AND TRYING TO RELEASE THAT INFORMATION TO\nQUIET DOWN CRITICS AGAINST THE FBI AND THEN THE FIX WAS IN.\nYOU'RE IN THE TANK FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nSO HE'S NOT LOOKING GOOD ANYWAY. YOU STRIKE IT, BUT HE CONTINUES\nTO PUT MORE INFORMATION OUT, CLOSE TO THE ELECTION.\n>> AND AT THE SAME TIME HE CLEARED HER THIS PAST SUMMER HE\nSAID HER HANDLING OF E-MAILS WAS RECKLESS.\nHE MADE AN EDITORIAL JUDGMENT. >> RIGHT.\n>> EVEN THOUGH HE DIDN'T PROSECUTE.\nKIND OF STUCK. >> WHICH WAS NEVER DONE.\n>> HE SAYS EXTREMELY RECKLESS. >> HE DID.\nA STATEMENT MADE FROM HIM DECIDING NOT TO MAKE THE CHARGE.\nBIGGEST THING THAT STICKS OUT A CANDIDATE YOU CAN'T DRAW A\nDIRECT LINE TO THE E-MAILS BUT SEE IN POLL AFTER POLL AFTER\nPOLL PEOPLE HAVE DEEP CONCERNS ACROSS AMERICA AND ACROSS\nDEMOCRAT GRAPHICS ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S HONESTY AND\nTRUSTWORTHINESS AND SOME POLLS PEOPLE SAY DONALD TRUMP IS MORE\nHON EFFORT AND TRUSTWORTHY. FROM THAT STANDPOINT, THIS\nREVERSE THEAL AND MAY BE AN OPE QUESTION IS NOT GOOD FOR HER\nCAMPAIGN. NO WAY TO TURN THIS AS A GOOD\nTHING FOR HER. >> THE LEGAL ISSUES ARE XPLEX\nWHAT WAS CLASSIFIED, WHEN IT WAS CLASSIFIED, WHAT SHE KNEW, LEGAL\nMATTERS THAT WILL BE SORTED OUT. WE KNOW AS A MATTER OF JUDGMENT,\nA DECISION TO DELETE 30,000 E-MAILS IS DAM THAT HAS BEEN\nDONE TO HER AND HER JUDGMENT THAT THAT WILL CONTINUE AND WILL\nPERHAPS BE THE SUBJECT OF AN INVESTIGATION AS TO WHAT MAY BE\nIN THOSE E-MAILS. >> THE QUESTION WHETHER PEOPLE\nHAVE ALREADY DECIDED ON THAT ISSUE.\n>> RIGHT. A POLITICAL MATTER.\n>> AND IS IT A POLITICAL MATTER OR WHETHER THERE ARE STILL SOME\nOF THOSE VOTERS WHO WERE UNDECIDED FOR WHOM THIS WILL\nMATTER AND THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT HOW HILLARY CLINTON\nDECIDES TO HANDLE THIS. >> QUICKLY TALKING ABOUT IN\nOCTOBER, A SURPRISE, POTENTIALLY COULD BE A OCTOBER SURPRISE.\n>> MULTIPLE. A VERY EVENTFUL OCTOBER.\nYES, WAITING TO SEE, OF COURSE, WHAT THIS BEARS OUT, BUT, YES.\n>> WE'RE GOING TO STAY ON TOP OF THE BREAKING NEWS.\nTHE FBI LOOKING INTO, ONCE AGAIN, LOOKING INTO THE HILLARY\nCLINTON E-MAIL ISSUE. MORE ON THAT.\nALSO COMING UP, DONALD TRUMP SET TO TAKE THE STAGE ANY MOMENT NOW\nIN NEW HAMPSHIRE. WILL HE SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THIS\nNEW DEVELOPMENT IN THE CLINTON E-MAIL SCANDAL?\nWE'LL BRING THAT TO YOU LIVE. STAND BY.\nLOTS OF NEWS HAPPENING. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.             You too.",

CONGRESSMAN, THANKS VERY MUCH\nFOR JOINING US. >> GREAT TO BE WITH YOU, WOLF.\n>> THIS IS SORT OF A BOMBSHELL RIGHT NOW COMING AT THE END OF\nOCTOBER. ONLY 11 DAYS BEFORE THE\nELECTION, THAT THE FBI DIRECTOR HAS DECIDED TO REOPEN THE\nINVESTIGATION INTO THE HILLARY CLINTON E-MAIL SCANDAL.\nWHAT'S YOUR REACTION? >> WELL, I CAN'T IMAGINE THERE'S\nANY THERE, OR ANYTHING THAT'S REALLY GOING TO VAN AFFECT ON\nTHE ELECTION. I THINK THE DONALD TRUMP\nSUPPORTERS CURRENTLY WITH HIM, THIS IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING\nHE'S GOING TO THROW OUT TO HIS CROWD AND THEY'RE GOING TO SAY,\nSEE, SEE, SEE? THE CLINTON PEOPLE AND THE\nCLINTON VOTERS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE WITH HILLARY AND\nI THINK FOR THE UNDECIDED VOTERS, HOWEVER MANY THERE ARE\nAT THIS POINT, ARE GOING TO BE MORE CONCERNED WITH THE FACT\nTHAT THE ECONOMY IS GROWING. THE FACT THAT HILLARY CLINTON\nWANTS TO INVEST INTO THEM, AND THAT SHE'S MORE ON THEIR SIDE\nTHAN DONALD TRUMP IS, IN THE LIGHT OF HOW DONALD TRUMP\nBEHAVED IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS. SO I THINK WHILE THIS WILL MAKE\nNEWS FOR SURE, I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO HAVE MUCH OF AN\nEFFECT ON THE ELECTION. >> HERE'S WHAT PROBABLY WILL\nHAPPEN, JUST BASED ON MY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE HERE IN\nWASHINGTON, AND YOU KNOW THIS AS WELL.\nTHE FBI IS GOING TO TRY TO KEEP THIS INFORMATION RELATIVELY\nQUIET. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO LEAK ANY OF\nTHIS INFORMATION PRESUMABLY, ALTHOUGH YOU NEVER KNOW WHERE\nTHE LEAKS COME FROM, BUT I SUSPECT OVER THE NEXT 11 DAYS\nWE'RE GOING TO GET A LOT MORE INFORMATION.\nWHAT ARE THE DOCUMENTS, WHERE THESE DOCUMENTS CAME FROM, DID\nTHEY CONTAIN CLASSIFIED INFORMATION?\nWAS IT SIMPLY CONFIDENTIAL OR WAS IT SECRET?\nWAS IT TOP SECRET? SHOULD SHE HAVE KNOWN?\nWAS IT MARKED CLASSIFIED? ALL OF THESE KINDS OF ISSUES.\nONCE AGAIN, WE'VE REVIEWED THEM FOR MOSS AND MOSS LEADING TO THE\nDECISION NOT TO RECOMMEND CHARGES, MONTHS, AND IN THE NEXT\n11 DAYS A DOMINANT ISSUE AND I ASSUME IS WORRIED YOU AS A\nHILLARY CLINTON SUPPORTERS? >> AS I SAID, I DON'T THINK IT'S\nGOING TO HAVE A LOT OF EFFECT ON THE CURRENT ELECTORATE BUT I'LL\nSAY THIS. WHERE HAVE THESE DOCUMENTS,\nWHERE DID THEY COME FROM? HOW DID THE FBI GET TO THEM?\nWHERE ARE THEY? ALL THIS STUFF GOING ON WITH\nRUSSIA NOW. ALL OF WIKILEAKS ISSUES OF\nSTOLEN DOCUMENTS WE DON'T REALLY EVEN KNOW IF SOME HAVE BEEN\nMANIPULATED OR NOT MANIPULATED. WHY DIDN'T THE FBI HAVE THESE\nDOCUMENTS THROUGH ALL OF THE DIFFERENT INVESTIGATIONS THEY\nWENT THROUGH ON THIS WHERE THE FBI SAID THAT, YOU KNOW, SHE\nDIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG? THAT MAYBE CARELESS, THAT'S IT,\nAND WOULD HAVE HAD TO HAVE BEEN A HUGE CONSPIRACY OF 300 PEOPLE\nIN THE STATE DEPARTMENT CONSPIRING TO, YOU KNOW, RELEASE\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. WHY DIDN'T IT COME UP IN ALL OF\nTHIS? HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN\nTHOROUGHLY VETTED ON THIS ISSUE. THE FBI CHOSE NOT TO DO ANYTHING\nWITH THE INFORMATION. AND WE HAVE ALL MOVED ON.\nSO THE QUESTION IS -- WHERE DID THESE DOCUMENTS COME\nFROM? HOW DID THEY GET TO THE FBI?\nIS RUSSIA INVOLVED IN THIS? WE DON'T HAVE ANY CLUE WHERE\nTHIS STUFF IS COMING FROM, AND SO FOR THIS TO COME OUT --\n>> THE ONLY THING WE KNOW, HE SAYS, IN -- COMEY SAYS IT WAS IN\nCONNECTION WITH AN UNRELATED CASE.\nALL OF A SUDDEN THEY CAME UPON THESE E-MAILS THAT MAY OR MAY\nNOT CONTAIN CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.\nARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT THE DECISION THAT THE FBI DIRECTOR\nJAMES COMEY HAS NOW MADE BASED ON THE INFORMATION HE RECEIVED\nYESTERDAY TO REOPEN THIS CASE? IN OTHER WORDS, DO YOU HAVE\nCONFIDENCE IN COMEY? >> WELL, YES.\nI THINK -- I THINK COMEY HAS THROUGHOUT THIS UPSET BOTH\nSIDES. I THINK YOU CAN SAY, WHICH\nUSUALLY SHOWS A LEVEL OF FAIRNESS.\nNOW, THIS IS A HUGE SURPRISE THAT THIS WOULD COME OUT JUST\nDAYS BEFORE AN ELECTION. THAT, TO ME, IS A SURPRISE, BUT\nI THINK HE'S PROVEN HIMSELF TO BE THOROUGH, AS AN INVESTIGATOR\nAND THAT'S WHY I'M CONFIDENT WITH HIS PASS DECISION SAYING\nTHAT HILLARY CLINTON DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG AND I'M SURE\nAFTER GOING THROUGH TENS OF THOUSANDS OF E-MAILS, TENS OF\nTHOUSANDS, AND FOR A COUPLE TO BE RULED CLASSIFIED, EVEN WHEN\nTHEY WEREN'T PROPERLY MARKED CLASSIFIED.\nLIKE, THAT'S ALL T",

THAT'S PART OF THE, THE LAW, IF\nYOU WILL, LEADING UP TO AN ELECTION.\nTHIS IS PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY FOR SPEAKER RYAN TO NOW TELL THE\nINTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AEND ANY CLASSIFIED BRIEFINGS FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON BECAUSE PRESUMABLY HE SAYS SHE CAN'T BE TRUSTED.\nYOUR REACTION TO WHAT THE SPEAKER HAS JUST SAID?\n>> I'M GLAD THE SPEAKER DIDN'T JUST ACT LIKE JUDGE AND JURY AND\nULTIMATELY MAKE A HUGE DECISION ON INFORMATION THAT HE KNOWS\nABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT.

HE MADE A JUDGMENT THERE ON\nINFORMATION THAT HE DOESN'T HAVE BEFORE HIM.\nTHAT HE DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT.

WE MUST NOT LET HER TAKE HER\nCRIMINAL SCHEME INTO THE OVAL OFFICE.\nI HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR THE FACT THAT THE FBI AND THE\nDEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ARE NOW WILLING TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO\nRIGHT THE HORRIBLE MISTAKE THAT THEY MADE.\nTHIS WAS A GRAVE MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\nFULLY UNDERSTOOD, AND IT IS EVERYBODY'S HOPE THAT IT IS TO\nBE CORRECTED. SO THAT IS A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT\nTHAT I HEARD TEN MINUTES AGO. AND I GUESS OBVIOUSLY MOST OF\nYOU FOLKS HAVE HEARD ABOUT, AND IN ALL FAIRNESS FOR ALL OF THE\nPEOPLE THAT HAVE SUFFERED FOR DOING SO MUCH LESS, INCLUDING\nJUST RECENTLY, FOUR-STAR GENERAL JAMES CARTWRIGHT, GENERAL\nPETRAEUS, AND MANY OTHERS, PERHAPS FINALLY JUSTICE WILL BE\nDONE. WITH THAT BEING SAID, THE REST\nOF MY SPEECH IS GOING TO BE SO BORING.\nSHOULD I EVEN MAKE THE SPEECH? WE WILL TALK ABOUT BORDERS.\nRIGHT? WE WILL TALK ABOUT TRADE.\nWE'LL BRING BACK OUR JOBS. WE'LL STRENGTHEN OUR MILITARY,\nAND LET'S GET GOING. OKAY?\nI WANT TO THANK GENERAL FLYNN. HE'S A GREAT GENERAL AND I WANT\nTO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, GENERAL.\nTHANK YOU VERY MUCH. JUST BEFORE THE GENERAL WAS\nGOING UP WE HEARD THIS NEWS. I SAID, GENERAL, GET UP THERE\nAND KEEP THEM BUSY. WE WANT TO -- WE WANT TO DIGEST\nWHAT JUST HAPPENED HERE. THANK YOU, GENERAL.\nIN 11 DAYS WE ARE GOING TO WIN NEW HAMPSHIRE.\nTHE STATE OF MY FIRST VICTORY, AND WE ARE GOING TO WIN BACK THE\nWHITE HOUSE. 75% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THINK\nOUR COUNTRY IS ON THE WRONG TRACK, AND WE ARE GOING TO FIX\nIT. WE ARE GOING TO GET OUR COUNTRY\nBACK ON THE RIGHT TRACK AND VERY, VERY QUICKLY.\nREAL CHANGE BEGINS WITH IMMEDIATELY REPEALINGABLE\nREPLACING OBAMA CARE, AND THAT IS BIG NEWS.\nTHAT IS BIG NEWS. WE CAN'T FORGET HOUR --\n>> CONTINUING TO MONITOR DONALD TRUMP.\nHE'S GETTING INTO HIS CAMPAIGN SPEECH RIGHT NOW TALKING ABOUT\nTHE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, OBAMA CARE, BUT THERE'S BREAKING NEWS,\nIMPORTANT BREAKING NEWS WE'RE FOLLOWING.\nTHE FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY JUST SENT A LETTER TO THE EIGHT\nCHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE COMMITTEES WHO HAVE BEEN\nINVESTIGATING THE HILLARY CLINTON E-MAIL SCANDAL IN WHICH\nHE SAYS THERE WILL BE A NEW INVESTIGATION.\nAMONG OTHER THINGS SAYS IN CONNECTION WITH AN UNRELATED\nCASE, THE FBI LEARNED OF EXISTENCE OF E-MAILS THAT APPEAR\nPERTINENT IN THE INVESTIGATION AND WRITING THAT THE TEAM\nBRIEFED ME ON THIS YESTERDAY AND AI GRADE THE FBI SHOULD TAKE\nAPPROPRIATE INVESTIGATIVE STEPS DESIGNED TO ALLOW INVESTIGATORS\nTO REVIEW THESE E-MAILS TO DETERMINE WETHTER THEY CONTAIN\nCLASSIFIED INFORMATION AS WELL AS ASSESS THEIR IMPORTANCE TO\nTHE INVESTIGATION. GLORIA BORGER, FOR THE FBI\nDIRECTORY MAKE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT 11 OR 12 DAYS BEFORE THE\nELECTION BASED ON INFORMATION HE HAS, I ASSUME THE INFORMATION\nMUST BE VERY, VERY SIGNIFICANT. IF HE'S GOING TO REOPEN HIS FBI\nINVESTIGATION BASED ON THE NEW INFORMATION HE RECEIVED, IT\nCAN'T JUST BE SOME TANGENTIAL ISSUE?\nIT'S GOT TO BE SOMEBODY SIGNIFICANT.\n>> WE DON'T KNOW, WOULF. TELL YOU ONE THING, REOPENING AN\nINVESTIGATION THAT WAS CLOSED INTO HILLARY CLINTON'S E-MAIL\nSERVER, NOT NECESSARILY HER PERSONAL E-MAILS BUT HER SERVER,\nIS SOMETHING THAT IS PERTINENT TO THIS ELECTION.\nAND I THINK THAT COMEY, AS YOU KNOW, HAS BEEN CRITICIZED BY\nBOTH SIDES OVER THIS MATTER, AND I THINK THAT IT MAY BE INCUMBENT\nUPON HIM TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THIS\nINVOLVES, BECAUSE OTHERWISE HE'S GOING TO BE CHARGED WITH LEADING\nA PARTISAN INVESTIGATION 11 DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION.\nSO HE IS INSERTING HIMSELF. I UNDERSTAND WHY HE WAS PROBABLY\nTRYING TO DO IT. BECAUSE I THINK THE FEELING,\nPROBABLY WAS, AND I DON'T KNOW THIS, THAT THESE THINGS LEAK OUT\nAS YOU WERE SAYING BEFORE, WOLF, AND THAT RATHER THAN HAVE THAT\nOCCUR, HE IS KIND OF A STRAIGHT SHOOTER WHO WANTED TO PUT IT OUT\nTHERE, BUT HAVING DONE THAT AND LEAVING THIS THING DANGLING\nWITHOUT KNOWING HOW SIGNIFICANT IT IS, WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT THE\nOTHER INVESTIGATION WAS, WITHOUT KNOWING ANY KIND OF SENSE OF\nWHETHER THIS IS HILLARY CLINTON'S E-MAILS OR E-MAILS\nTHAT WERE ON HER SERVER, JUST LEAVES IT DANGLING OUT THERE AND\nMAKING IT EVEN MORE OF A PARTISAN FOOTBALL THAN IT\nALREADY WAS BEFORE WITH ALL OF THESE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS.\n>> JUANA SUMMERS, CLEARLY SOMETHING THAT THE CLINTON, THAT\nTHE HILLARY CLINTON OPPONENTS, THE DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN, YOU\nJUST HEARD FROM DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF, THEY'RE WELCOMING THIS\nBIG TIME AS THEY SAY. KELLYANNE CONWAY TWEETING A\nGREAT DAY. -- THE CAMPAIGN MANAGER FOR\nTRUMP -- A GREAT DAY IN OUR CAMPAIGN GOT BETTER.\nFBI RENEWING NEW E-MAILS IN CLINTON PROBE.\nTHEY'RE GOING TO USE THIS GOING FORWARD DURING THESE FINAL 11\nDAYS, AND YOU SAW HOW PLEASED AND HAPPY DONALD TRUMP IS.\n>> THAT BECAME IMMEDIATELY CLEAR AS THE SCORER WAS DEVELOPING,\nSCROLLING THROUGH MY INBOX LISTENING TO DONALD TRUMP.\nSTATEMENT AFTER STATEMENT FROM REPUBLICANS ON CAPITOL HILL\nINCLUDING SPEAKER RYAN, GONGMAN BOB GOODLOE SHARES THE JUDICIARY\nCOMMITTEE. UNACCEPTABLE.\nSHOULDN'T GET BRIEFINGS. SHOWS HER RECKLESSNESS.\nIN ANY POLITICAL RACE UP AND DOWN THE BALLAS, BEGIN THEIR\nSPEECHES TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE, POINTING OUT THE FACT WE\nHAVE A CANDIDATE IN HILLARY CLINTON WHO IS COMPROMISED.\nVOTERS CAN'T TRUST. A WAY TO GET BACK IN THE GAME,\nTIGHTEN MARGINS IN SOME TIGHT SENATE AND HOUSE RACES ACROSS\nTHE COUNTRY. GIVEN A LITTLE BIT OF A\nPOLITICAL GIFT AND SMART TO RUN WITH IT.\n>> MICHELLE KACZYNSKI, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT.\nSPEAK ARE OF THE HOUSE PAUL RYAN ISSUED A STATEMENT AMONG OTHER\nTHINGS CALLING ON THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE TO\nSUSPEND ALL CLASSIFIED BRIEFINGS FOR SECRETARY CLINTON UNTIL THIS\nMATTER IS FULLY RESOLVED. SUGGESTING SHE CAN'T BE TRUSTED\nWITH CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. >> RIGHT.\nHE AND OTHERS CALLED FOR THAT BEFORE AS WELL.\nWE HAVEN'T YET HEARD FROM THE WHITE HOUSE ON THIS BREAKING\nNEWS. THEY MAY NOT RESPOND UNTIL ONE\nOF THE PRESS OFFICIALS SPEAKS TO THE PRESS AS SCHEDULED LATER IN\nTHE AFTERNOON, AS PRESIDENT OBAMA IS ON HIS WAY TO STUMP FOR\nHILLARY CLINTON IN FLORIDA. IT REMINDS ME OF THE FIRST TIME\nON THE TRAIL TOGETHER. THEIR FIR APPEARANCE IN NORTH\nCAROLINA ON THE VERY DAY COMEY ANNOUNCED HIS FINDINGS THE FIRST\nTIME. NOW GOING DOWN TO FLORIDA, WHICH\nIS IT A TIGHT RACE, WANTS THAT MAKE THIS CASE AND THIS COMES\nUP. NEITHER MENTIONED IT IN THEIR\nSORT OF BIG PRESENTATION OF THE FIRST TIME ON THE TRAIL.\nINTERESTING TO SEE HOW HE ADDRESSES IT.\nWE'VE SEEN A MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE PRESIDENT OBAMA.\nHE'S LOOSER. HE SPEAKS HIS MIND MORE AND\nSAID, LOOK, YOU KNOW, AND JUST -- HE SPEAKS MUCH MORE\nCOMFORTABLY ABOUT SOME OF THE ISSUES OUT THERE.\nSO I'M CURIOUS TO SEE >> THIS ONE NOT GET BETWEEN THE\nFBI DIRECTOR AND HILLARY CLINTON.\n>> TO MAKE THE CASE IN HIS OWN WORDS \"OUR LEGAL AFFAIRS\nADVISOR. OUR ANALYST RIGHT NOW I SHOULD\nSAY. JAMES COMEY SAID IN JULY HE'S\nSUSPENDING THE INVESTIGATION. HE FOUND NO REASON TO RECOMMEND\nCRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON AL SHE HE SAID SHE ACTED\nEXTREMELY CARELESS IN HER USE OF HIS PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER.\n>> IT'S EXTRAORDINARY. WHO ARE THE ONES TO DECIDE TO\nBRING CHARGES. IT'S EXTRAORDINARY BECAUSE HE\nENTERED INTO THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION VARIOUS FACTS THAT NEVER\nWOULD HAVE COME OUT UNLESS THEY WERE LEAKED SO HIS CHOICE TO SAY\nTHE WORDS \"CARELESS\" ET CETERA SHOWS YOU THERE WAS AN ACT ON\nHIS PART IN AN EFFORT TO BE TRANSPARENT THAT HAS COME TO\nHAUNT HILLARY CLINTON. HE IS NOT REOPENING THE\nINVESTIGATION INTO THE E-MAIL SERVER, HIS STATEMENT IS HE'S\nTRYING TO WHETHER NEW E-MAILS CAME TO LIGHT OR WHETHER SHE\nINTENDED TO THWART THE LAW IS AND TRIED TO USE THE E-MAIL\nSERVER, ET CETERA, OR USE HER E-MAILS THAT ALLOWS CLASSIFIED\nDATA TO BE EXPOSED. GLORIA IS CORRECT.\nWE DON'T HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT LOOKS LIKE.\nALTHOUGH LEGALLY SPEAKING IT'S NOT SO SHOCKING WE DON'T HAVE\nCONCLUSIONS. OPTICALLY IN POLITICS THIS IS AN\nEXTRAORDINARY MEASURE AND CAN BE BLAMED ON COMEY'S DECISION TO\nPROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION WHERE NOBODY\nELSE WOULD. >> OUR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT\nEVAN PEREZ QUOTING LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCES SAYING THESE\nNEWLY DISCOVERED E-MAILS THAT THE FBI NOW HAS POSSESSION OF\nARE NOT RELATED TO THE WIKILEAKS MATTER OR THE CLINTON FOUNDATION\nALTHOUGH THE SOURCES WILL NOT DESCRIBE IN FURTHER DETAIL THE\nCONTENT OF THE E-MAILS. I WANT TO BRING IN JASON MILLER\nRIGHT NOW, THE SENIOR COMMUNICATIONS ADVISOR TO THE\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN JOINING US FROM NEW YORK.\nJASON, THANKS VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US.\n>> WOLF, THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME ON.\n>> YOU HEARD YOUR BOSS DONALD TRUMP.\nHE'S OBVIOUSLY GLEEFUL, BUT WHAT IF ANYTHING ELSE DO YOU KNOW\nABOUT THIS THAT IS BEING MADE PUBLIC BY THE FBI DIRECTOR\nHIMSELF. >> WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT THIS THE\nSAME TIME THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IS BUT THIS IS TRULY, TRULY\nREMARKABLE DEVELOPMENT. THIS CLOSE TO THE ELECTION TO BE\nREOPENING THE INVESTIGATION MEANS WHATEVER IT IS THEY FOUND\nTO BE VERY SIGNIFICANT. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS, WE\nSEE THAT THE FBI WILL MAKE THAT AVAILABLE BEFORE THE ELECTION.\nTHAT WILL BE SOMETHING THAT COMES FORWARD SO THE AMERICAN\nPEOPLE CAN MAKE A DECISION BUT THIS HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT\nWE'VE TALKED ABOUT A LOT WITH THE ABSOLUTE VIOLATION OF TRUST\nOF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE OF NOT ONLY EXPOSING THIS CONFIDANTE\nSHL AND CLASSIFIED INFORMATION BUT THEN ALSO THE COVERUP AND\nTRYING TO KEEP IT QUIET SO THAT THESE ARE THINGS WE THINK VOTERS\nNEED TO KNOW ABOUT BEFORE ELECTION DAY.\n>> THE FBI DIRECTOR SAYS HE CAN NOT PREDICT HOW LONG IT WILL\nTAKE TO COMPLETE THIS WORK. MY SUSPICION IS HE WON'T RELEASE\nMORE INFORMATION BETWEEN NOW AND THE ELECTION THAT IS ONLY 11\nDAYS AWAY BUT THERE PROBABLY WILL BE SERIOUS LEAKING GOING\nON. IN WASHINGTON PEOPLE TALK AND\nGET THIS INFORMATION BUT YOU PRESUMABLY SEE THIS AS A MOM\nWITH -- BOMBSHELL HAS HELPING CONVINCE UNDECIDED VOTERS TO NOT\nVOTE FOR HILLARY CLINTON BUT TO VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nI ASSUME THAT'S THE WAY YOU SEE THIS.\n>> THIS GOES TO WHAT MR. TRUMP SAYING ALL ALONG, THAT THERE ARE\nREAL PROBLEMS HERE, THIS IS SOMEONE WHO PUT CONFIDANTE SHL\nINFORMATION OUT THERE IN A COMPLETELY UNSECURE SERVER.\nTHIS IS A VIOLATION OF THE TRUST.\nTHAT THIS WAS SET UP SPECIFICALLY TO GET AROUND LAWS\nAND SYSTEMS IN PLACE. WOLF, THINK ABOUT IT.\nFIVE DIFFERENT PEOPLE TOOK THE FIFTY IN THE INVESTIGATION INTO\nTHIS. THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN IF NO CRIMES\nWERE COMMITTED OR IF LAWS HADN'T BEEN BROKEN.\nSOMETHING STINKS HERE AND I'M GLAD THE FBI IS GOING TO GET TO\nTHE BOTTOM OF IT. >> JASON MILLER, THANKS FOR\nJOINING US.",

I THINK A LITTLE BIT MORE\nTRANSPARENCY IS ACTUALLY REQUIRED HERE.\nI THINK HE'S TRYING TO BE TRANSPARENT IN PUBLICIZING WHAT\nHE WAS DOING BUT YOU ARE 11 DAYS BEFORE AN ELECTION SO IT'S KIND\nOF AN EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCE.\nWE HAVE DONALD TRUMP TALKING WHO JUST A FEW DAYS AGO WAS TALKING\nABOUT THE FBI BEING RIGGED TODAY SAYING HE HAS GREAT RESPECT FOR\nMR.

              "text": ">>> WELCOME BACK TO OUR BREAKING\nNEWS. WE ARE LIVE AT THE TAMPA MUSEUM\nOF ART IN FLORIDA. WE'LL TALK THE SIGNIFICANCE OF\nFLORIDA, BOTH DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON'S PATH TO THE\nWHITE HOUSE THROUGH THIS STATE. FIRST THE BREAKING STORY FROM\nTHE FBI TODAY, FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY REOPENING THE\nINVESTIGATION INTO HILLARY CLINTON'S PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER.\nHE'S ALLOWING HIS INVESTIGATORS TO REVIEW E-MAILS -- WE DON'T\nKNOW WHOSE E-MAILS THEY ARE, BY THE WAY, TO DETERMINE WHETHER\nTHEY CONTAIN CLASSIFIED INFORMATION AND ASSESS THEIR\nIMPORTANCE IN THE INVESTIGATION. BY THE WAY IT'S ALSO VERY\nUNLIKELY WE WILL GET ANY CONCLUSION TO THIS INVESTIGATION\nBEFORE ELECTION DAY, REMINDER, IT'S 11 DAYS AWAY.\nMICHELLE KOSINSKI IS OUR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT.\nSHE IS STANDING BY. ALSO A REMINDER TO EVERYONE, THE\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WILL BE BACK IN THIS CRUCIAL\nBATTLEGROUND STATE OF FLORIDA IN JUST A COUPLE OF HOURS FROM NOW,\nOBVIOUSLY SOMETHING FOR HILLARY CLINTON AND I'M SURE HE'LL\nMENTION THE SENATE RACE AS WELL. BUT MICHELLE KOSINSKI, ON THIS\nBREAKING NEWS, THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF HAS SAID SHE HAS FLAWS.\nHOW WILL HE ADDRESS THIS? >> YEAH, THAT'S THE BIG QUESTION\nHERE, YOU KNOW THE WHITE HOUSE IS WORKING ON HOW TO RESPOND TO\nTHIS. THEY HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING YET\nTHEY'RE NOT RESPONDING TO REQUESTS AT THIS POINT.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA JUST LEFT THE BOWES EN ROUTE TO FLORIDA.\nREPORTERS WERE YELLING A BARRAGE OF QUESTIONS AL AT HIM ON THE\nSUBJECT AND HE DIDN'T ANSWER THEM AT THIS POINT.\nBUT YOU KNOW THIS REMINDS ME OF THE FIRST TIME HE APPEARED ON\nTHE TRAIL SIDE BY SIDE WITH HILLARY CLINTON IT WAS IN NORTH\nCAROLINA AND THAT, REMEMBER, WAS ON THE VERY SAME DAY THAT JAMES\nCOMEY ANNOUNCED HIS FINDINGS OF THAT INITIAL INVESTIGATION.\nNEITHER THE PRESIDENT NOR HILLARY CLINTON MENTIONED ANY OF\nTHAT IN THEIR ADDRESS TO THE CROWD THAT DAY AND IT COULD BE A\nSIMILAR SITUATION TODAY. IT'S INTERESTING TO LOOK OUT,\nTHOUGH, HOW THE PRESIDENT HAS SPOKEN ABOUT THIS AS RECENTLY AS\nYESTERDAY. NOT SPECIFIC TO HER E-MAILS BUT\nHE SAID YES, HILLARY CLINTON -- THE WAY HE FRAMED THIS, THIS WAS\nON A RADIO SHOW, HE SAID SHE GETS A BAD RAP BUT THAT SHE HAS\nFLAWS. \"SHE'S MADE MISTAKES IN THE PAST\nJUST LIKE EVERYBODY HAS, BUT THESE ARE NOTHING\" HE SAID\n\"COMPARED TO THE DAILY ONGOING TRANSGRESSIONS MR. TRUMP ENGAGES\nIN.\" AND HE SAID \"CHEATING PEOPLE WHO\nWORK FOR HIM BY NOT PAYING THEM, HIS ATTITUDES TOWARDS WOMEN, HIS\nATTITUDES TOWARDS MINORITIES, HIS ATTITUDES TOWARDS CIVIL\nRIGHTS AND HIS ATTITUDES TOWARD MUSLIM AMERICANS.\"\nSO IT TELLS YOU A LOT ABOUT HOW HE COULD FRAME HIS RESPONSE TO\nTHE NEWS THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS IS OUT THERE AS HE'S CAMPAIGNING\nFOR HER IN FLORIDA TODAY SO HE NEEDS TO MAKE A STRONG CASE FOR\nHER AND FOR THE GOOD QUALITIES SHE HAS AND YOU KNOW HE'S GOING\nTO WANT TO HIT UPON HARDWORKING AND HONEST AND HAVING THE BEST\nOF INTENTIONS AND HE WANTS TO MAKE AS BAD A CASE AS POSSIBLE\nAGAINST DONALD TRUMP. IN FACT, HE WAS IN FLORIDA JUST\nABOUT A WEEK AGO AND THAT'S WHERE WE HEARD ONE OF HIS MOST\nENERGETIC TAKEDOWNS OF DONALD TRUMP USING WORDS LIKE \"CRAZY\"\nAND TOM SICK, ERRATIC AND DANGEROUS.\nAND THE PRESIDENT HAS SORT OF BECOME LOOSER ON THE CAMPAIGN\nTRAIL SPEAKING WHAT SEEMS TO BE MORE FROM HIS HEART, WANTING TO\nSAY WHAT'S ON HIS MIND SO IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW\nHE, WITHOUT ADDRESSING SPECIFICS RELATED TO HILLARY CLINTON'S\nE-MAILS, THAT'S LIKELY GOING TO BE THE CASE BUT HOW HE ADDRESSES\nTHE ENTIRE SITUATION THROUGH THE WORDS HE CHOOSES TO SAY, BROOKE.\n>> MICHELLE, THANK YOU. MICHELLE KOSINSKI.\nON HILLARY CLINTON, YOU'RE LOOKING AT LIVE PICTURES, SHE IS\nSPEAKING AT HER RALLY IN CEDAR RAPIDS, IOWA.\nWE HAVE A LOT OF EARS LISTENING IN.\nAS SOON AS SHE MENTIONS OR ADDRESS THIS IS BREAKING NEWS\nWE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING FROM THE FBI WE WILL TAKE IT LIVE.\nCARL BERNSTEIN, CARL BERNSTEIN IS ON THE PHONE WITH ME.\nCARL, WE HAVE BEEN TALKING FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS AND MONTHS\nABOUT THE ELECTION. YOU WROTE THE DEFINITIVE BOOK ON\nTHE CLINTONS, ON HILLARY CLINTON.\nYOU'VE BEEN SAYING THAT THIS IS THE DRIP, DRIP, DRIP THAT COULD\nULTIMATELY HAUNTER. >> WELL, THERE'S NO QUESTION\nTHAT THE E-MAILS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THE GREATEST THREAT TO HER\nCANDIDACY FOR PRESIDENT, THAT HER CONDUCT IN REGARD TO THE\nE-MAILS IS REALLY INDEFENSIBLE AND IF THERE WAS GOING TO BE\nMORE INFORMATION THAT CAME OUT, IT WAS THE ONE THING, AS I SAID\nON THE AIR LAST NIGHT, ACTUALLY THAT COULD REALLY PERHAPS AFFECT\nTHIS ELECTION. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS\nYET EXCEPT THAT IT'S A REAL BOMBSHELL.\nAND IT IS UNTHINKABLE THAT THE DIRECTOR OF THE FBI WOULD TAKE\nTHIS ACTION LIGHTLY, THAT HE WOULD PUT THIS LETTER FORTH TO\nTHE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES SAYING THERE IS MORE\nINFORMATION OUT THERE ABOUT CLASSIFIED E-MAILS AND CALL IT\nTO THE ATTENTION OF CONGRESS UNLESS IT WAS SOMETHING\nREQUIRING SERIOUS INVESTIGATION. SO THAT'S WHERE WE ARE.\nIS IT A CERTAINTY THAT WE WON'T LEARN BEFORE THE ELECTION?\nI'M NOT SURE IT'S A CERTAINTY WE WON'T LEARN BEFORE THE ELECTION.\nONE THING IS IT'S POSSIBLE THAT HILLARY CLINTON MIGHT WANT TO ON\nHER OWN THISHIVE TNITIATIVE TAL FBI AND FIND OUT WHAT SHE CAN\nAND IF SHE CHOOSES TO LET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW WHAT SHE\nTHINKS OR KNOWS IS GOING ON. PEOPLE NEED TO HEAR FROM HER.\n>> CARL, I'M SITTING HERE IN FLORIDA AND REMINDING MYSELF\nTHAT EARLY VOTING HAS LONG SINCE BEGUN AND THIS WILL BE FOR FOLKS\nPAYING ATTENTION TO THIS CAMPAIGN, FOR FOLKS WHO ARE\nEITHER UNDECIDED OR NOT THIS WILL BE A BIG EARLY VOTING\nWEEKEND HERE IN FLORIDA. WHAT CAN, WHAT SHOULD HILLARY\nCLINTON SAY TO ADDRESS THIS FOR VOTERS IN THESE KEY SWING\nSTATES? >> I THINK IF SHE HAS\nINFORMATION AVAILABLE TO HER FROM THE FBI OR ANY OTHER SOURCE\nAS TO HER KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT THESE E-MAILS MIGHT BE,\nHOPEFULLY SHE WILL LET US KNOW WHAT THEY ARE AND WHAT IS UNDER\nDISCUSSION HERE. RIGHT NOW WE'RE ALL TALKING IN A\nVACUUM BUT I WANT TO ADHERE THAT IN THE LAST, OH, 36, 48 HOURS,\nTHERE HAS BEEN AN UNDERCURRENT OF KIND OF SPECULATIVE\nDISCUSSION AMONG SOME NATIONAL SECURITY PEOPLE THAT SOMETHING\nMIGHT SURFACE IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS ABOUT E-MAILS AND I THINK\nTHE EXPECTATION IN THIS CHATTER -- AND I TOOK IT AS JUST\nCHATTER BUT INFORMED CHATTER, TO SOME EXTENT -- WAS THAT IT WOULD\nRELATE TO ANOTHER ROUND OF WIKILEAKS E-MAILS WHICH OUR\nJUSTICE DEPARTMENT PEOPLE SEEM TO BE SAYING IS NOT THE CASE,\nBUT THERE HAS BEEN SOME NOISE IN THE NATIONAL SECURITY COMMUNITY\nTHE LAST DAY OR TWO OF THIS KIND OF POSSIBILITY OF SOME KIND OF\nREVELATION. BUT THIS IS HER ACHILLES HEEL\nAND WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT IT ALSO COMES ON THE -- BACK TO THE\nWORD HEEL -- OF THE REVELATIONS ABOUT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nSO THE CONFLUENCE OF ALL OF THIS IS BAD FOR HER AS IT STANDS NOW\nBUT WITH SOME KNOWLEDGE SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO STOP, TURN\nTHINGS AROUND AND GIVE US SOME IDEA OF WHAT'S GOING NONA WAY WE\nMIGHT NOT OTHERWISE KNOW AND ALSO IT'S VERY POSSIBLE THAT\nSOME MEMBERS OF CONGRESS VERY QUICKLY ARE GOING TO GET AN IDEA\nOF WHAT THESE E-MAILS ARE AND WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT AND FOR\nWHATEVER PURPOSE PUT SOME INFORMATION OUT THERE.\n>> WE WILL SEE BECAUSE THUS FAR WE DON'T KNOW A HECK OF A LOT.\nJUST TO BE CLEAR, WE DON'T KNOW IF THESE ARE EVEN HILLARY\nCLINTON'S OWN E-MAILS IN QUESTION.\nWE JUST KNOW DIRECTOR COMEY SAID THESE ARE PERTINENT TO THE\nINVESTIGATION. CARL BERNSTEIN, THANK YOU SO\nMUCH FOR CALLING IN, ALWAYS LOVE HAVING YOUR VOICE IN THESE SORTS\nOF CONVERSATIONS.",

DOES THAT MEAN THESE ARE NOT\nFROM THE E-MAIL TROVE THE STATE DEPARTMENT HANDED OVER?\nDOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH OTHER E-MAILS NOT RELATED TO THE STATE\nDEPARTMENT? WE REALLY DON'T KNOW, ALL WE\nKNOW RIGHT NOW IS THAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAS NOT BEEN\nOFFICIALLY NOTIFIED THAT THE FBI IS REOPENING ITS INVESTIGATION\nAND THE START HAS BEEN IN THE HOT SEAT FOR THE SLOW PACE WHICH\nINVESTIGATORS AND CONGRESS FEEL THEY'VE BEEN HANDING OVER THESE\nE-MAILS FROM SECRETARY CLINTON. IT'S BEEN A LONG AND ARDUOUS\nPROCESS IN TERMS OF GETTING THEM OUT IN THE PUBLIC BUT THE STATE\nDEPARTMENT DOES SAY AS IT HAS IN THE PAST IT WILL CONTINUE TO\nCOOPERATE WITH THE FBI AS NEEDED BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE STATE\nDEPARTMENT VOLE IN THESE E-MAILS THAT DIRECTOR COMEY MENTIONS.\n>> ELISE LABOTT, THANK YOU, MY FRIEND, HOW WILL THIS\nREVERBERATE WITH VOTERS?

HILLARY CLINTON STARTED SPEAKING\nHERE BEHIND ME 20 MINUTES AGO, HASN'T ADDRESSED THE ISSUE\nSPECIFICALLY BUT SAID SOMETHING THAT MADE MY EARS PERK UP.\nSHE SAYS \"DONALD TRUMP STILL THINKS HE CAN WIN THIS ELECTION,\nAND YOU KNOW WHAT?

I WAS TALKING TO A SOURCE\nFAMILIAR WITH SOME OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CAMPAIGN AND THE\nIMPRESSION OF THAT SOURCE WAS THAT THEY HADN'T HAD ANY KIND OF\nHEADS UP SO THEY'RE REALLY STARTING FROM ZERO HERE FIGURING\nOUT HOW TO RESPOND. >> JOSH GREEN, TO YOU.\nYOU'VE TALKED TO TIPTOP PEOPLE ON THE TRUMP SIDE.\nWE JUST HEARD TRUMP RESPOND A MOMENT AGO.\nTHE NEW PIECE OF THE REPORTING IS THAT THESE ARE NOT HILLARY\nCLINTON'S OWN E-MAILS THEY'RE TAKING A CLOSE LOOK AT BUT\nTHEY'RE STILL LOOKING AT E-MAILS THAT INVOLVED HER PRIVATE E-MAIL\nSERVER. DO YOU THINK THIS IS -- LET ME\nREPHRASE, HOW BIG OF A PRE-ELECTION DAY GIFT DO YOU\nTHINK THIS IS FOR TEAM TRUMP? >> THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN THINKS\nTHIS IS A HUGE ELECTION DAY GIFT.\nI JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH ONE OF TRUMP'S TOP ADVISORS WHO\nSAID \"WE'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO HEAR MORE FROM TRAUMP AND\nCERTAINLY NOT FROM THE CAMPAIGN ON THIS ISSUE.\nHE SAID \"WE DON'T WANT TO STEP ON COMEY'S LINES.\"\nSO THEY ARE HAPPY TO PULL BACK AND\nAND CEDE THE MEDIA SPOTLIGHT AND TRY TO GET THE STORY OFF OF\nTRUMP'S -- THE VOTER SUPPRESSION STORY WE WROTE ABOUT IN\n\"BUSINESSWEEK\" AND SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN\nDOGGING HIS CAMPAIGN RECENTLY. >> SO READING BETWEEN THE LINES\nFROM THIS TOP ADVISOR TO YOU, THEY'RE GOING TO LET COMEY DO\nTHE SPEAKING AND KEEP TRUMP QUIET.\nLET THE NEWS SPEAK FOR ITSELF. >> LET THE NEWS SPEAK FOR\nITSELF. THE PHRASE HE USED FOR ME WAS\n\"WE'RE GOING TO LET THIS BREATHE.\"\nTHEY WANT PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT IT ON CABLE NEWS, THIS IS\nOBVIOUSLY UNWELCOME NEWS FOR CLINTON AND THAT MEANS WELCOME\nNEWS FOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN SO ACCORDING TO MY SOURCES THEY'LL\nPULL BACK AND LET THIS BECOME THE FOCUS IN THE WEEKEND.\n>> HEIDI, TO YOU, JUST ON THE FACT THAT THE FBI DIRECTOR IS\nCOMING OUT AND DOING THIS WITH 11 DAYS BEFORE ELECTION DAY.\nHE HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY CRITICIZED FROM BOTH SIDES BUT\nHE'S INSERTED HIMSELF IN THE STORE RIP IN A KEY PART OF THIS\nRACE. WHY DO YOU THINK THIS IS\nHAPPENING? >> YOU KNOW, THERE ARE SOME\nEARLY REPORTS THAT LEGALLY HE HAD TO INFORM CONGRESS BUT THE\nBOTTOM LINE IS GIVEN THE TIMING OF THIS, IT IS A POLITICAL\nFOOTBALL AND WILL BE A POLITICAL FOOTBALL UNTIL AND IF HE\nPROVIDES MORE INFORMATION BECAUSE THIS IS TRICKLING OUT.\nALL WE KNOW IS THAT THERE WERE NEW E-MAILS FOUND.\nWE DON'T -- THEY AREN'T EVEN HER E-MAILS AND I BRING YOU BACK,\nBROOKE, TO THE INVESTIGATION ITSELF.\nI WATCHED ALL OF HIS TESTIMONY AND I REMEMBER CLEARLY THAT THE\nCASE WAS VERY MUCH BUILT AROUND ACCIDENT AND THAT WAS WHY IT WAS\nSO HARD TO REALLY GO AT HILLARY CLINTON ON THIS BECAUSE IT WAS\nINTENT TO TRANSFER CLASSIFIED INFORMATION AND WHETHER THE\nSERVER ITSELF AMOUNTED TO INTEND TO TRANSFER CLASSIFIED\nINFORMATION SO EVEN FINDING A CLASSIFIED E-MAIL ON THERE THAT\nSHE SENT OR RECEIVED DIDN'T SATISFY THAT BURDEN BECAUSE IF\nYOU REMEMBER THERE WAS AN E-MAIL IN THERE THAT WAS MARKED \"C\" IT\nWAS JUST LOWER DOWN AND THAT THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR COMEY TO\nFIND REASON TO PROCEED SO I THINK WE ALL NEED TO TAKE A BIG\nBREATH HERE AND I DO THINK THAT THAT DIRECTOR COMEY, GIVEN THE\nTIMING OF IT, IS GOING TO HAVE TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION.\n>> MAYBE THAT INFORMATION WILL BE FORTHCOMING.\nNEVERTHELESS, HILLARY CLINTON WILL HAVE TO RESPOND AND,\nBRIANNA, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WILL BE NOT TOO\nTERRIBLY FAR FROM WHERE I AM IN FLORIDA IN A COUPLE HOURS\nSTUMPING FOR HILLARY CLINTON AND I'M SURE MENTIONING THE SENATE\nRACE IN FLORIDA. HE HAS SAID YES HILLARY CLINTON\nHAS FLAWS, HOW DOES HE ADDRESS THIS?\n>> HE MIGHT NOT AT ALL. HE MAY WAIT TO LET THE CAMPAIGN\nADDRESS THIS AND SEE WHAT THEY DO.\nWE'VE BEEN SEEING HIM AND MICHELLE OBAMA AND OTHER REALLY\nBIG SURROGATES GOING INTO THE BATTLEGROUND STATES SO WHAT I\nWOULD EXPECT HIM TO DO FIRST AND FOREMOST IS TO MAKE A CASE FOR\nHILLARY CLINTON AS NOT SAY THAT SHE IS SOMEONE WHO'S GOING TO\nTAKE HIS BATON AND IS GOING TO BACK UP SOME OF HIS ACHIEVEMENTS\nAS PRESIDENT, MAKE SURE OBAMACARE IS PRESERVED AND\nTHAT'S WHAT I WOULD EXPECT TO HEAR FROM HIM AND I WOULD ALSO\nEXPECT TO HEAR HIM HIT DONALD TRUMP IN A BIG WAY.\nI DON'T KNOW THIS FOR SURE SO KEEP THAT IN MIND BUT I WOULDN'T\nEXPECT HE WOULD ADDRESS THIS. >> OKAY, THAT HAPPENS IN A\nCOUPLE OF HOURS, THE PRESIDENT IS IN ORLANDO.\nJOSH, ON THIS E-MAIL QUESTION FOR HILLARY CLINTON, SHE'S\nADDRESSED IT IN MULTIPLE DEBATES AND INTERVIEWS SHE'S GIVEN.\nIS IT FAIR TO SAY HER ANSWER HAS NEVER BEEN -- SHE'S STRUGGLED TO\nANSWER THE QUESTION, PUT IT THAT WAY?\n>> SHE HAD BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY TO DEFEND THIS.\nSHE SAID INITIALLY IT WAS JUST FOR CONVENIENCE OR FOR THIS OR\nTHAT AND CLEARLY THE OBJECT HERE WAS TO PROTECT OTHER PEOPLE FROM\nSEEING HER E-MAIL, WHETHER IT WAS CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS OR\nTHE FBI OR WHOEVER, IT WAS A MISTAKE, SHE'SING A NEW JERSEYED\nIT'S A MISTAKE. DEMOCRATS INCLUDING PEOPLE IN\nTHE WHITE HOUSE HAVE BEEN FRUSTRATED SHE DID THIS IN THE\nFIRST PLACE. THIS IS A SELF-CREATED PROBLEM\nFOR CLINTON AND SO IT'S UNFORTUNATE FOR HER BUT NOT\nENTIRELY UNEXPECTED IT WOULD REAR UP AT THE END OF THE\nCAMPAIGN JUST AS IT SEEMED LIKE CLINTON HAD THE MOMENTUM GOING\nIN TO ELECTION DAY. >> IS IT POSSIBLE, HEIDI, JUST\nTHINKING OF BRIANNA'S POINT ABOUT SHE'S NOT ADDRESSING IT AT\nTHE RALLY, THE PRESIDENT MAY NOT ADDRESS IN THE ORLANDO.\nIS IT POSSIBLE THE HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN LETS THE FBI\nTAKE THE LEAD ON THE INVESTIGATION AND THEY DON'T\nADDRESS IT? PERIOD?\nTHEY LET THE CLOCK RUN OUT? >> I WOULD BE SURPRISED, BROOKE,\nBECAUSE THE STAKES ARE SO HIGH AND WHAT THIS HAS SUCCEEDED IN\nDOING IS BASICALLY SHIFTING THE REFERENDUM OF THIS ELECTION TO\nBE ON TO HER WHICH THIS ENTIRE TIME THESE PAST FEW WEEKS IT'S\nBEEN ON DONALD TRUMP AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TWO CANDIDATES WHO\nHAVE HIGH NEGATIVE RATINGS AND THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN MANAGED TO\nKEEP THE FOCUS ON HIM. IF THEY DON'T ANSWER THIS AND\nPUSH THE FBI OR PUSH FOR MORE TRANSPARENCY ON WHAT IS GOING ON\nHERE, THEN IT LEAVES THAT OPEN, IT LEAVES THE DOUBT OPEN ABOUT\nWHERE WE'RE GOING WITH THIS AND AS YOU CAN SEE THE REPUBLICANS\nWILL WALK RIGHT THROUGH THAT DOOR AND SAY WELL IT MEANS SHE'S\nGOING TO BE INDICTED AND DRAW ALL KINDS OF CONCLUSIONS THAT\nMAY BE WILDLY INACCURATE SO I DON'T THINK THEY CAN AFFORD TO\nBE PASSIVE ABOUT IT. >> ANOTHER POINT, TOO, BROOKE --\n>> THEY HAVE TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE ADDRESSING BEFORE THEY\nADDRESS. >> IT HOW DO THEY KNOW WHAT\nTHEY'RE ADDRESSING, THOUGH? >> THAT'S RIGHT.\nWE'RE GETTING MORE INFORMATION, WHOSE E-MAILS?\nIS IT HERS? WE HAVE SOURCING SAY IT'S NOT SO\nTHESE ARE THINGS AS WELL THAT THEY ARE LEARNING AND IN ORDER\nFOR THEM TO FORMULATE A RESPONSE AND NOW HOW SHE SHOULD RESPOND\nAND WHAT SHE SHOULD RESPOND WITH THEY HAVE TO HAVE A BETTER SENSE\nOF WHAT THIS NEW STERILE THAT WOULD FORCE OPENING THE\nINVESTIGATION INTO THIS ALL OVER AGAIN.\n>> TO REITERATE IT WAS A DEVICE THEY DIDN'T HAVE FOR THE\nPREVIOUS INVESTIGATION AND THESE AREN'T HILLARY CLINTON'S\nE-MAILS. JOSH, GO AHEAD.\n>> I THINK IT'S IN THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN'S INTEREST TO PUT\nPRESSURE ON THE FBI TO EXPLAIN IN MORE DETAIL WHAT EXACTLY IT\nIS THAT THEY HAVE BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T INVOLVE HILLARY CLINTON\nAND HER PERSONAL E-MAILS, IF IT DOESN'T INVOLVE AS SEVERAL\nREPORTERS ON CNN WIKILEAKS OR THE CLINTON FOUNDATION THEN IT'S\nPROBABLY NOT AS A LOT OF PEOPLE -- ESPECIALLY REPUBLICANS\nAND ESPECIALLY DONALD TRUMP -- ARE ASSUMING IT IS SO GETTING\nMORE DETAIL IS PROBABLY SOMETHING THAT THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN WOULD LIKE GIVEN THE MEDIA REACTION IN THE HOUR SINCE\nTHE STORY BROKE. >> JOSH AND HEIDI AND BRIANNA,\nTHANK YOU ALL.",

              "text": ">>> WE'RE BACK HERE LIVE IN\nTAMPA, FLORIDA. WE HAVE SOME NEW INFORMATION\nHERE ON THIS NEWS FROM THE FBI, HOW THEY'LL BE REVIEWING SOME\nNEW E-MAILS AS IT ALL PERTAINED TO HILLARY CLINTON'S PRIVATE\nE-MAIL SERVER. I'LL LET EVAN PEREZ, OUR JUSTICE\nCORRESPONDENT, TELL YOU WHAT HE HAS NOW LEARNED.\nEVAN PEREZ, THE FLOOR IS YOURS. >> BROOKE, WHEN WE LAST TALKED A\nFEW MINUTES AGO ONE OF THE THINGS WE WERE TRYING TO NAIL\nDOWN WAS WHAT UNRELATED INVESTIGATION -- WHAT PROMPTED\nTHE FBI TO DISCOVER THESE NEW E-MAILS AND WE NOW KNOW, THE FBI\nHAS BEEN TAKING A LOOK AT ANTHONY WEINER AND HIS ALLEGED\nSEXTING WITH AN UNDERAGED -- WITH AN UNDERAGED GIRL.\nTHE FBI HAS BEEN TAKING A LOOK AT WHETHER OR NOT HE COMMITTED A\nCRIME IN THAT CASE. AS PART OF THAT INVESTIGATION,\nTHE FBI HAS BEEN EXAMINING COMPUTERS AND OTHER DEVICES THAT\nWERE SHARED BY ANTHONY WEINER AND HIS BIEWIFE, HOUMA ABEDIN,\nCLOSE AIDE TO HILLARY CLINTON AND WE'RE TOLD THOSE ARE THE\nDEVICES THEY WERE EXAMINING IN THAT CASE IS HOW THEY UNCOVERED\nTHESE NEW E-MAILS. AGAIN, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE\nE-MAILS CONTAIN, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT SIGNIFICANCE THEY WILL HAVE\nTO THIS INVESTIGATION. IT MAY WELL BE THAT THEY DON'T\nCONTAIN SERIOUSLY -- HIGHLY CLASSIFIED INFORMATION, HOWEVER\nTHE FBI IS NOW GOING THROUGH THAT PROCESS, THE PROCESS THEY\nSPENT A YEAR DOING AS PART OF THIS HILLARY CLINTON E-MAIL\nINVESTIGATION, THEY'RE GOING TO CHECK WITH THE OTHER AGENCIES,\nTHE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES THAT MAY OWN THIS INFORMATION TO\nDETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS CLASSIFIED AND WHETHER OR NOT\nTHIS CHANGES THE OUTCOME OF THIS CASE AS YOU REMEMBER.\nBACK IN JULY, THE FBI DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH\nEVIDENCE TO BRING CHARGES AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON.\nHOWEVER THIS NEW EVIDENCE NOW OBVIOUSLY IS GOING TO MAKE THEM\nTAKE A NEW LOOK. AGAIN, THESE E-MAILS WERE\nUNCOVERED AS PART OF THISANTHON AND CASE IS STILL ONGOING.\n>> SO JUST SO I'M CRYSTAL CLEAR, THE BREAKING NEWS WAS PART OF\nTHE ANTHONY WEINER SEXTING SCANDAL THAT HAS BEEN BROUGHT\nBACK INTO THE SPOTLIGHT BECAUSE THE FBI HAS DEEMED THIS\nPERTINENT TO THE INVESTIGATION INTO HILLARY CLINTON'S PRIVATE\nE-MAIL SERVER? >> THAT'S RIGHT.\nRIGHT, THEY HAD PREVIOUSLY OTHER DEVICES BUT THEY DID NOT HAVE\nTHIS DEVICE THAT THEY FOUND THESE E-MAILS.\nTHEY DID NOT HAVE THAT IN THEIR POSSESSION UNTIL THEY BEGAN\nDOING THIS ANTHONY WEINER INVESTIGATION WHICH WE\nPREVIOUSLY REPORTED IS ONGOING. WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THESE\nE-MAILS WERE, WE DO KNOW THEY WERE NOT SENT BY HILLARY\nCLINTON, WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY IF IT WAS HOUMA ABEDIN THAT SENT\nTHE E-MAILS OR WHETHER SHE WAS THE RECIPIENT OF THESE E-MAILS\nBUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WAS NOW VIEWED TO BE PERTINENT TO\nTHE INVESTIGATION, THAT'S WHY THE FBI IS TAKING A NEW LOOK.\n>> GOT IT. I GOT IT.\nWELCOME TO 2016. EVAN PEREZ, THANK YOU FOR THE\nUPDATE. WE HAVEN'T HEARD YET FROM\nPARTISANS ON ALL OF THIS SO LET'S DO IT.\nTRUMP SUPPORTER KAYLEIGH McENANY IS WITH ME, YOU JUST HEARD THE\nLATEST DEVELOPMENT ON THE -- WELL, YOU HEARD IT.\nKAG KAYLEIGH, WHAT DO YOU THINK?\n>> THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED FOR THE FBI TO OPEN WHAT WAS A CRIMINAL\nINVESTIGATION INTO SOMEONE'S SERVER WHO IS NOW RUNNING AS THE\nDEMOCRATIC NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT.\n>> WE KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THIS IS WHAT THE DOCUMENTS ARE\nRELATED TO, RELATED TO THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION INTO\nHILLARY CLINTON'S SERVER, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FBI HAS BUT\nWE DO KNOW IT'S RELATED TO THAT AND THERE WERE A LOT OF US\nSTARTING WITH DONALD TRUMP OUT THERE SAYING SOMETHING IS GOING\nON HERE, YOU HAVE FIVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN GIVEN IMMUNITY,\nYOU HAVE ASSOCIATES HAMMERING BLACKBERRIES TO COVER THIS UP.\nSOMETHING DID NOT SEEM RIGHT AND NOW WE KNOW THIS INVESTIGATION\nIS RENEWED AND IF HILLARY CLINTON BECOMES PRESIDENT OF THE\nUNITED STATES SHE MAY VERY WELL BE SUBJECT TO A CRIMINAL\nINVESTIGATION. >> BASIL, YOUR TURN?\nHOW WOULD YOU RESPOND? >> I'D LIKE TO PUMP THE BRAKES A\nLITTLE BIT ON THAT BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE SPECULATING DOWN A\nPATH THAT IS REALLY NOWHERE -- WE SHOULDN'T BE GOING DOWN.\nALL WE NOW RIGHT NOW IS THAT THERE IS A DEVICE THAT THE FBI\nDID NOT HAVE THAT THEY NOW HAVE. THEY'RE ASKING MORE QUESTIONS.\nWE DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE QUESTIONS ARE BUT WE ALSO KNOW\nTHE E-MAIL -- THEY WERE E-MAILS NOT SENT FROM HILLARY CLINTON'S\nSERVER THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS NEW RENEWED INVESTIGATION.\nSO THAT'S ALL WE KNOW. I DON'T WANT TO START\nSPECULATING AS TO WHETHER -- WHAT SHE SAID, WHAT SHE DIDN'T\nE-MAIL BACK AND FORTH. IF I BELIEVE THAT THE FBI\nDIRECTOR SAID THIS CASE WAS CLOSED I BELIEVE HE DID A\nTHOROUGH ENOUGH INVESTIGATION TO WARRANT THAT.\nI WOULD HOPE THAT WHATEVER HAS LED HIM DOWN THIS PATH AT THIS\nPOINT WILL BE QUICKLY WRAPPED UP AND WE CAN GET ON THE BUSINESS\nOF THE LAST 11 DAYS. WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO HAVE\nTO DEAL WITH THIS NOW BUT, YOU KNOW, I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT\nWHATEVER IS GOING ON AT THIS POINT THAT WE'LL HAVE A QUICK\nWRACKUP TO IT. WE CAN MOVE ON ABOUT THIS\nBUSINESS OF THIS COUNTRY. >> LET ME ASK WITH YOU TO STAND\nBY. WE'RE ALSO GETTING -- HANG ON,\nKAY KAYLEIGH.\nWE'RE GETTING REACTION FROM MEMBERS OF CONGRESS.\nLET'S GO TO MANU RAJU. HE'S TALKING TO FOLKS ON CAPITOL\nHILL. MANU WHAT ARE YOU HEARING?\n>> BROOKE, REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THEY FINALLY FOUND A RALLYING\nCRY AFTER MONTHS OF DISCORD. PAUL RYAN, HE HAS NOT UTTERED\nDONALD TRUMP'S NAME PUBLICLY SINCE THE RELEASE OF THAT\n\"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD\" VIDEO BUT MOMENTS AFTER THIS LETTER BY THE\nFBI WAS RELEASED BY SENATE REPUBLICANS, RYAN ISSUING THE\nSTATEMENT SAYING CLINTON SHOULD BE DENIED CLASSIFIED BRIEFING\nAND HOW VULNERABLE HOUSE AND SENATE REPUBLICANS HAVE AN ISSUE\nTO SEIZE UPON. THEY'RE MAKING THIS ARGUMENT,\nBROOKE, KEEP CONGRESS IN GOP HANDS AND THE CHECK AGAINST THE\nEXECUTIVE BRANCH. THIS IS THE POINT THAT DARRELL\nISSA, THE CALIFORNIA CONGRESSMAN WHO'S IN A VERY DIFFICULT\nREELECTION FIGHT SAID IN A STATEMENT SAYING CONGRESS NEEDS\nTO BE -- THEY NEED TO ELECT A REPUBLICAN -- THIS DECISION\nSHOWS EXACTLY WHEY WE NEED STRONG WATCHDOGS IN CONGRESS TO\nENSURE THOROUGH OVERSIGHT OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH.\nPEOPLE THAT WE HAVE NOT HEARD YET FROM ARE DEMOCRATS,\nPARTICULARLY ONES IN DIFFICULT REELECTION RACES.\nSOME OF THEM HAVE ALREADY GIVE AN PASS TO CLINTON ON THE E-MAIL\nISSUE BUT WE EXPECT TO HEAR MORE FROM THEM NOW.\nTHEY WILL BE FORCED TO RESPOND SO HOW WILL THEY RESPOND.\nWE DENT KNOW YET, BROOKE. ONE OTHER POINT OF NEWS, CHUCK\nGRASSLEY, THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN, SAYING HE IS\nREQUESTING A PRIVATE BRIEFING WITH THE FBI TO LEARN MORE ABOUT\nTHIS NEW PROBE SO REPUBLICANS CLEARLY ARE SEIZING ON THIS\nBELIEVING THEY FINALLY HAVE A CAMPAIGN ON AND AN ISSUE WILL\nHOUND HILLARY CLINTON IF SHE WERE TO BECOME PRESIDENT,\nBROOKE. >> THERE'S SO MUCH WE DON'T\nKNOW. THERE'S SENATOR GRASSLEY TRYING\nTO GET MORE, MANU, THANK YOU SO MUCH.\nLET ME BRING BASIL AND KAYLEIGH BACK IN.\nBASIL, I WAS TALKING TO CONGRESSMAN PATRICK MURPHY A\nLITTLE WHILE AGO, HE'S A TOUGH FIGHT WITH THE INCUMBENT SENATOR\nMARCO RUBIO WHO WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE BEEN PRESIDENT AND THIS\nIS SORT OF THE LAST THING A DEMOCRAT WOULD WANT TO HAPPEN\nEVEN IF, BY THE WAY, THIS AMOUNTS TO NOTHING WE MAY NOT\nKNOW THAT UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION.\nHOW SHOULD DEMOCRATS DOWN BALLOT HANDLE THIS?\n>> I TELL YOU, AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STATE PARTY HERE\nIN NEW YORK DOWN BALLOT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO ME AND\nTO US BECAUSE WE WANT TO ELECT PEOPLE TO HELP HILLARY CLINTON\nGOVERN AND I WOULD SAY TO PATRICK MURPHY AND TO OTHERS,\nTHERE'S NOTHING -- WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO SPECULATE.\nTHE LAST THING I WOULD WANT ANYBODY TO DO IS SPECULATE.\nWE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SAY TO THE VOTERS AND TO EACH OTHER QUITE\nFRANKLY, IS THAT WE HAVE BEEN THERE WITH HILLARY CLINTON, WE\nTRUST AND SUPPORT HILLARY CLINTON AND WE KNOW SHE WOULD BE\nA GOOD PRESIDENT FOR US AND FOR THE COUNTRY.\nTHAT'S WHAT WE HAVE BEEN SAYING THROUGHOUT THE CONVERSATION\nABOUT E-MAILS WITHIN THE LAST YEAR OR SO.\nI THINK THE VOTERS HAVE MADE UP THEIR MINDS ABOUT IT.\nAGAIN, I SAID THIS BEFORE, THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT SOMETHING THAT\nI WANT TO HAVE TO TALK ABOUT 11 DAYS OUT, BUT I THINK THAT -- I\nTHINK THERE ARE SUPPORTERS ON THE GROUND WHO ARE OUT THERE IN\nNEW YORK AND IN OTHER STATES THAT ARE PUSHING HILLARY\nCLINTON'S MESSAGE AND I THINK VOTERS WHEN THEY LOOK AT HER\nABILITY TO GOVERN VERSUS DONALD TRUMP'S I THINK THEY'LL MAKE THE\nDECISION TO STAY WITH HER. >> BASIL, I UNDERSTAND --\n>> KAYLEIGH -- >> I UNDERSTAND BASIL'S APPEAL",

BUT, AND HERE IS THE BIG \"BUT,\"\nTHE S&P IS AT THAT CRITICAL LEVEL, 2130 OR SO LEVEL.\nDOES THIS AMAZON QUARTER KNOCK THE S&P DOWN AND DOES THE S&P IN\nTURN KNOCK AMAZON DOWN?

AMAZON CAME IN AS A STOCK THAT\nHAD NOT ONLY A RIDICULOUS VALUATION BUT THE EXPECTATIONS\nWERE VERY HIGH. THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS WHY\nTHEY MAY NOT MAKE MARGINS. THEY'RE GOOD REASONS FOR THE\nCOMPANY LONGER TERM. THEY'RE SPENDING ON LOGISTICS,\nTHEY'RE GOING TO TRIPLE THEIR CONTENT, DOUBLE UP THEIR VIDEO.\nTHIS WAS EXACTLY WHAT IN 2005, FIRST QUARTER OF -- SORRY, 2015,\nFIRST QUARTER, IS WHAT TOOK THE STOCK ON A ROLLER COASTER RIDE,\nBASICALLY STRAIGHT UP.

THEY NEED TO SEE SOME\nSTABILIZATION, AT LEAST THE WAY INVESTORS ARE THINKING ABOUT THE\nVOLATILITY IN THEIR RESULTS. LISTEN, THEIR ONE BRIGHT SPOT\nMAYBE IS THAT DAILY ACTIVE USERS WERE UP LIKE 7% YEAR OVER YEAR.\nMONTHLY ACTIVE USERS WERE UP LOW SINGLE DIGITS.\nIT SHOWED POSSIBLY INCREASED ENGAGEMENT.\nMAYBE THAT DROPS OFF ONCE WE GET BY THE ELECTION.\nI DON'T KNOW. >> ARE WE LISTENING TO THE SAME\nNUMBER? THEIR ESTIMATES ARE GOING UP FOR\nTHE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME, THAT'S VERY BULLISH FOR THIS\nCOMPANY. THE MONETIZATION IS A CONCERN.\nI'M SURPRISED THE STOCK IS NOT UP A LOT MORE.\nPEOPLE STILL NEED TO SEE MORE OUT OF THIS COMPANY.\nI WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THIS COMPANY DELIVERING SOMEWHAT\nPOSITIVE GUIDANCE. THESE GUYS ARE DEBBIE DOWNERS\nEVERY TIME THEY GIVE A CALL. THE FACT THAT THIS WAS\nRELATIVELY POSITIVE, TO ME I THOUGHT THE STOCK SHOULD HAVE\nBEEN UP 5%. >> WOULD YOU BUY?\n>> NO. LISTEN, I'VE TRIED IT A COUPLE\nOF TIMES. I GET WHAT DAN SAYS, IT'S A\nUNIQUE PROPERTY. I SEE THE UTILITY OF THIS\nCOMPANY, I GET IT. IT'S TOO FRUSTRATING TO WATCH\nTHIS COMPANY WILT ON THE VINE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT DOING\nANYTHING. THE BIGGEST INNOVATION IS TO PUT\nA STICKER ON THE TOP OF THE THING TO SHOW ME THERE'S MORE\nTWEETS THERE. >> ARE YOU ON TWITTER RIGHT NOW,\nON THIS DESK? >> OH, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT\nTWITTER?

ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE SAID IS,\nTHE BEST THING THAT POTENTIALLY COULD HAPPEN TO TWITTER IS THAT\nPEOPLE WALK AWAY FROM ACQUIRING TWITTER.\nIF AND WHEN THEY FIGURE THIS OUT I THINK IT WILL BE WORTH A LOT\nMORE THAN $25. >> YOU OWN THE STOCK?\n>> I THINK YOU HAVE TO. LOOK, I THINK THE RISK/REWARD IS\n15 ON THE DOWNSIDE, WHICH IS PERCENTAGE-WISE, 10.5, 11%.\nWHATEVER IT IS. AND THE UPSIDE TO ME IS NORTH OF\n25. >> LET'S GIVE BOB A BREAK HERE\nFROM THE CONFERENCE CALL. WHAT DID YOU MAKE THE TWITTER'S\nQUARTER? >> A COUPLE OF THINGS.\nPEOPLE THOUGHT THE QUARTER COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE, THE GUIDANCE IS\nSTILL WEAK. THEY'RE STILL CALLING FOR LOW\nSINGLE DIGIT GROWTH, WORSE THAN PEOPLE HAD THOUGHT.\nTHE QUESTION IS, WHAT'S NEXT, HOW DO YOU TURN THIS AROUND?\nIF M&A IS NOT ON THE TABLE RIGHT NOW, WHAT HAPPENS IN '17?\nMEANTIME YOU'LL HAVE LAYOFFS, RIGHT SIZE THE COST STRUCTURE IN\nTHE MEANTIME. >> BOB, THANKS.\n>> MR.

IN FACT, THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS\nIS SO BAD RIGHT NOW THAT WHEN PEOPLE -- THAT PEOPLE LOVED,\nLOVED, LOVED IT WHEN BUFFALO WILD WINGS PREDICTED ITS\nFRANCHISES WOULD HAVE MINUS 1.70 FRANCHISE SAME-STORE SALES,\nTHAT'S RIGHT, DOWN 1.7%. AND WHAT HAPPENED SOME IT KWAM\nIN AT MINUS 1.6%. THE FACT THAT IT WAS A NEGATIVE\nSALES NUMBER, THAT DIDN'T MATTER.\nTHE STOCK WENT UP OVER $8 TODAY OR 6%.\nIT'S ALMOST STUPEFYING, ISN'T IT?\nBUT THAT'S HOW BAD THIS INDUSTRY IS.\nIN THE LAND OF THE BLIND, THE ONE-EYED RESTAURANT CHAIN IS\nINDEED KING. TWITTER ALMOST PULLED THIS OFF\nTODAY. CAME VERY CLOSE.\nEMPHASIS OF COURSE IS ON ALMOST. THE STOCK WAS FLYING HIGH IN THE\nMORNING BECAUSE THE TRAJECTORY OF THEIR DAILY AVERAGE USERS WAS\nPOSITIVE. TWITTER WAS SUPPOSED TO REPORT A\nHORRENDOUS NUMBER. PART OF THAT WHOLE PROCESS BY\nWHICH THE COMPANY WAS UNABLE TO SELL ITSELF.\nAMID ALL OF THE OTHER RANCOR AND BAD WILL THAT DEVELOPED DURING A\nPROCESS THAT WAS PLAYED OUT WAY TOO PUBLICLY FOR MANY WAS THE\nBELIEF THAT WHEN TEERT NEXT REPORTED, IT WOULD DELIVER\nNUMBERS SO DISAPPOINTING THAT THE STOCK WOULD GO RIGHT BACK TO\nTHE $14 LEVEL, WHERE IT WAS BEFORE ALL THE TAKEOVER HOOPLA\nSTARTED. BUT TWITTER DIDN'T DO THAT.\nIT MANAGED TO REPORT THE KIND OF DISGUSTINGLY -- IT DID NOT THE\nDISGUSTINGLY TERRIBLE QUARTER THAT INVESTORS HAD ANTICIPATED.\nFOR A LITTLE WHILE IT LOOKED LIKE TWITTER'S STOCK WAS GOING\nTO BREAK OUT FOR GOOD. THEN WE LEARNED THE COMPANY WAS\nSHUTTING DOWN VINE. THAT WAS SOMETHING AT ONE POINT\nSPECULATORS THOUGHT WOULD BE THE REASON FOR SOMEONE TO ACQUIRE\nTWITTER. SO THE PRE-EARNINGS DESPERATION\nCAME BACK TO LIFE. IT DIDN'T HELP THEY TRIMMED\nTHEIR FORECAST EITHER. MY TAKE?\nLISTEN. IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM A\nLOT OF PEOPLE'S TODAY. YOU KNOW WHAT?\nI THINK GENUINELY IT WASN'T AS BAD AS I EXPECTED IT WOULD BE.\nTWITTER DID BEAT ON BOTH REVENUE AND EARNINGS.\nPLUS I THINK THIS NUMBER MAKES IT MORE LIKELY THAT TWITTER CAN\nCOME BACK INTO PLAY. THAT'S RIGHT.\nYOU HEARD ME. ESPECIALLY IF THEY DEVELOP\nSOMETHING THAT CAN USE MACHINE LEARNING TO ACTUALLY KNOCK OFF\nTHE TROLLS, WHICH I KEEP TELLING YOU IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE\nVALUATION. IF THEY DO THAT, I AM SAYING\nRIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW, THAT POTENTIAL ACQUIRERS WILL COME\nBACK, AND THIS COMPANY WILL BE BOUGHT BY SOMEONE ELSE WHO CAN\nUSE ALL THAT DATA TO HELP THEIR CLIENTS MAKE BETTER DECISIONS\nABOUT WHAT CONSUMERS WANT AND WHERE THEY'RE ADVERTISING\nDOLLARS COULD BE BEST SPENT. BUT, SEE, IT'S A ONE-TWO PUNCH.\nFIRST TWITTER HAS TO FIX THE TROLL PROBLEM, MAKING IT MORE OF\nA COMMUNITY THAT PEOPLE WANT TO GO TO OR NOT BE SCARED BY, AND I\nTHINK THEY COULD BE DOING THAT. THEN THEY HAVE TO KEEP THE\nPROCESS OF THE SALE QUIETER. IT GOT TOTALLY OUT OF HAND THE\nLAST TIME THE COMPANY PUT ITSELF UP FOR THE SALE OR WAS BEING\nSOLD, TO THE POINT WHERE IT BECAME $29 A BUS, FOR $29 A\nSHARE, THERE WAS NOBODY WILLING TO BUY THI THING, CORRECTLY\nSINCE THE ACQUIRER'S STOCK WOULD HAVE BEEN PUMMELED AT THAT PRICE\nTAG. I THINK THE DISCIPLINE OF\nCLOSING VINE AND CHOPPING HEADS, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME SHOWING\nSOME GROWTH, IS GOING TO MAKE TWITTER MORE ATTRACTIVE TO\nBUYERS. BUT, AGAIN, NOT UNTIL THE TROLL\nISSUE IS DEAD AND BURIED BECAUSE THE SHAREHOLDERS OF ANY\nPOTENTIAL SUITORS MIGHT DESPITE TWITTER FOR ITS INABILITY TO\nTAMP DOWN THE HATE EVEN AS THEY CAN'T KEEP THEIR EYES OFF IT TO\nSEE WHAT'S HAPPENING. BELIEVE ME, THEY CONTINUE TO FIX\nTHINGS UP, AND A GOOGLE OR A SALESFORCE WILL BE RIGHT BACK\nTHERE KICKING THE PROVERBIAL TIRES.\nFINALLY THERE ARE COMPANIES THAT RECOGNIZE THEY CAN CHANGE THE\nCOLORATION OF WHAT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THEM AND MANAGE TO MAKE\nTHEIR STOCKS SOAR. FOR YEARS QUALCOMM JUST KEPT\nDISAPPOINTING WALL STREET.  HOW THE HECK DOES A COMPANY LIKE\nTHAT MAKE WALL STREET SEE THAT IT ISN'T AS BAD AS THEY THINK IT\nIS? HOW ABOUT BY MAKING A BIG\nACQUISITION THAT CHANGES THE COMPANY'S STRIPES FROM A SO SO\nCELL PHONE CHIP PLAY INTO AN INTERNET OF THINGS UBL\nSEMICONDUCTOR COMPANY WITH SOME TERRIFIC CELL PHONE TECHNOLOGY\nON THE SIDE. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TODAY WHEN\nWE LEARNED QUALCOMM IS PLUNKING DOWN -- YOU CAN FOLLOW ALONG FOR\nAT ACTIONALERTSPLUS.COM. QUALCOMM STOCK ACTUALLY JUMPED\nMORE THAN NXPI'S. WHY?\nIT'S NOT AS BAD AS WE THOUGHT. IT'S GREAT TO BE BETTER THAN\nEXPECTED, BUT IN THIS MARKET, I'LL GLADLY TAKE NOT AS BAD AS\nWE THOUGHT. WHY BOTHER TO LOOK THROUGH IT?\nTHE DARN STRATEGY IS WORKING. PATRICK IN FLORIDA, PATRICK.\n>> Caller: HOW ARE, YOU JIM CRAMER?\n>> GOOD DAY FOR ME, PATRICK. HOW ABOUT YOU?\n>> Caller: EXCELLENT. THANKS FOR ASKING.\nJIM, A QUESTION FOR YOU. I'M LONG ON TESLA, AND WITH\nTHEIR RECENT EARNINGS REPORT AND SOLAR CITY ACTIVITY, I'M\nWONDERING WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ON THEIR GROWTH AND STOCK\nAPPRECIATION. >> PATRICK I THINK IF WE'RE NOT\nBUYING SOLAR CITY, I THINK THAT STOCK WOULD HAVE UP VERY BIG ON\nTHAT QUARTER EVEN THOUGH IT WAS AIDED BY SOME CREDITS.\nBUT BECAUSE THEY ARE BUYING SOLAR CITY, THE STOCK STALLED,\nAND THAT IS THE ISSUE IN MY EYES.\nI NEED TO GO TO CHARLES IN MISSOURI.\nCHARLES. >> Caller: HEY, JIM.\nI LIVE IN A SMALL TOWN IN THE BOOTHILL OF MISSOURI.\nWALMART JUST ANNOUNCED CLOSING OF OUR LOCAL STORE IN JANUARY OF\n2017. WE'VE HAD A STORE HERE FOR 40\nYEARS. IN LIGHT OF THE JET.COM PURCHASE\nBY WALMART, ARE SMALL STORES LIKE OURS SACRIFICIAL LAMBS, AND\nWHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE STOCK IN THE COMPANY'S FUTURE?\n>> WELL, CHARLES, IT IS TRUE THAT WALMART IS ACTUALLY CLOSING\nSOME STORES THEY THINK ARE UNDERPERFORMERS AND I THINK IT'S\nABOUT TIME. I FEEL BAD THEY CLOSED YOUR\nSTORE. THE JET.COM ACQUISITION IS VERY\nIMPORTANT. I CONTINUE TO SUPPORT EXACTLY\nWHAT DOUG McMILLAN IS DOING, AND HE IS ALWAYS WELCOME ON \"MAD\nMONEY.\" HOW ABOUT KEVIN IN TENNESSEE?\nKEVIN. >> Caller: MR. JIM.\nI HAVE OWNED TRACTOR SUPPLY FOR YEARS, AND IT'S PEREDTIL ITS RE.\nDO I BUY, SELL OR HOLD? >> OH, BOY.\nYOU KNOW, THAT WAS SUCH A BAD QUARTER, AND I KEPT THINKING\nWHEN THEY REPORTED THEIR ACTUAL NUMBER AFTER THEY FIRST SAID\nTHAT THINGS WOULD BE BAD, THAT IT WAS TIME TO PULL THE TRIGGER.\nBUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.\nNOW WE GOT TO WAIT FOR TAX LOSS SELLING BEFORE I CAN SAY IT IS\nTIME TO BUY TRACTOR SUPPLY. IT'S NOT OUTSTANDING.\nIT'S NOT EVEN GREAT. REALLY IT'S NOT EVEN GOOD, BUT\nIT IS NOT AS BAD AS WE THOUGHT. AND RIGHT NOW THAT'S ENOUGH FOR\nWALL STREET. ON \"MAD MONEY\" TONIGHT, IT'S\nHELPING ZILLOW, H&R BLOCK, AND KIMBERLY-CLARK CONNECT THEIR\nBUSINESSES. COULD IT HELP YOUR PORTFOLIO AS\nWELL? I'M SITTING DOWN WITH THE CEO OF\nSERVICE NOW. THEN THE NEGLECTED SECTORS ARE\nALIVE WITH THE SOUND OF PROFITS. I'LL TELL YOU WHICH ONES BEATEN\nDOWN ARE SUDDENLY SHOWING SIGNS OF LIFE.\nAND GROUPON CLOSED DOWN MORE THAN 20% TODAY BUT IT'S STILL UP\nOVER 30% FOR THE YEAR. IS THE DEAL OF THE DAY GOOD OR\nSHOULD IT BE AVOIDED? I'M TALKING WITH THE COMPANY'S\nCEO, SO STICK WITH CRAMER.",

RE-RATING SOME VERY BIG SECTORS,\nMEANING INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS ARE PUSHING MONEY INTO GROUPS\nTHAT HAVE BEEN STALLED OUT OR NEGLECTED FOR AGES.\nTHEY SUDDENLY COME ALIVE BECAUSE SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO MAKE\nTHEM MORE VALUABLE THAN THEY WERE JUST A COUPLE QUARTERS AGO.\nTAKE THE BANKS. THE BANKS MAKE UP A HUGE\nPERCENTAGE OF THE S&P 500, BUT THEIR PERFORMANCE HAS LAGGED\nBEHIND THE AVERAGES FOR AGES AND AGES.\nTHAT'S BECAUSE THE BANKS HAVE BEEN STUCK IN INTEREST RATE AND\nREGULATORY HELL. THE FINANCIALS SIMPLY CAN'T MAKE\nTHAT MUCH MONEY OFF YOUR DEPOSITS BECAUSE RATES ARE SO\nLOW. LATELY, THOUGH, INVESTORS HAVE\nBEEN PINNING THEIR HOPES ON A POTENTIAL RATE HIKE, WHICH WILL\nLET THE BANKS GENERATE HIGHER PROFITS PRETTY MUCH RISK-FREE.\nBUT THIS TIME RIGHT NOW, IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS, BUYERS ARE\nGOBBLING THESE BANK STOCKS UP NOT BECAUSE OF A RATE HIKE BUT\nBECAUSE OF FEES. YEP, THE FOCUS IS ON FEES, FEES,\nAND MORE FEES. MAYBE ENOUGH FEES TO MAKE PEOPLE\nWANT TO OWN FINANCIALS FOR MORE THAN JUST THE NET INTEREST\nMARGIN. THAT HAS BEEN THE ONLY THING\nANYONE HAS CARED ABOUT FOR THREE YEARS.\nWHERE ARE THE BANKS MAKING THIS MONEY?\nWHEN YOU SEE GIANT IPOs LIKE ZTO EXPRESS, FORGET THE FACT THAT IT\nDIDN'T DO WELL, WE HAVE TO TAKE NOTICE OF WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE\nBANKS. THEY'RE MAKING MONEY ON THAT,\nESPECIALLY IT SOUNDS LIKE A SNAPCHAT IPO MIGHT NOT BE THAT\nFAR AWAY, AND THAT IS GOING TO COIN MONEY FOR THE BANKS.\nINITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS ARE VERY LUCRATIVE BUSINESS BUT\nTHERE YEAR THERE HAVEN'T BEEN VERY MANY AND IT'S HURT THE\nEQUITY SALES TRADING.

HOW BIG COULD THE RIPPLES BE?\nI'LL GO OUT ON A LIMB HERE AND SAY IF THE FEDERAL RESERVE\nRAISES RATES IN DECEMBER, GET THIS, THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.\nTHE MOST BELEAGUERED COMPANY IN THE UNIVERSE RIGHT NOW, YOU CAN\nFILL IN THE BLANK, YES, TALKING WELLS FARGO, MIGHT EVEN SEE ITS\nSTOCK GO HIGHER. NOW, THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING.\nIN THE MEANTIME, CITIGROUP REMAINS THE CHEAPEST OF THE\nBANKS ON A BOOK VALUE. I THINK IT CAN VAULT $15 FROM HERE.\nLOOK, IT'S NOT JUST THE BANKS. WE'RE SEEING A SIMILAR RE-RATING\nOF THE OIL SERVICE STOCKS. ONCE CRUDE GOT TO 50, DOMESTIC\nDRILLING STARTED PICKING UP. THE BIG DOGS THAT PROVIDE\nASSISTANCE TO THE OIL PRODUCERS, WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE SCOOP IN\nOKLAHOMA, ARE SEEING A REAL REVIVAL.\nTHAT'S HOW THE STOCK OF HALLIBURTON AND BAKER HUGHES\nHAVE BEEN -- FINALLY THE AIRLINE STOCKS ARE BACK IN BUSINESS.\nI SAY THAT BECAUSE WHEN SOUTHWEST SAYS THAT THINGS ARE\nPRETTY DOWN BEAT ABOUT THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT AND THEN\nMANY OF THE OTHER STOCKS IN THE COHORT ARE EITHER HIT WITH\nMERELY GLANCING BLOWS OR ACTUALLY GO HIGHER ON THE SAME\nDAY OF A SOUTHWEST MORNING, WELL, THAT'S JUST A PLANE OF A\nDIFFERENT COLOR. THE MUCH IMPROVED UNITED\nCONTINENTAL REMAINS MY FAVORITE IN THAT SECTOR.\nHERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE. THE BANKS, THE OIL SERVICE\nCOMPANIES, AND THE AIRLINES, AIR ALL GROUPS THAT THE MARKET HAD\nGIVEN UP ON FOR AT LEAST THE LAST YEAR, MAYBE LONGER.\nAND THEY'RE ALL INCHING BACK.

I WAS REALLY KIND OF WONDERING\nIF YOU CAN MAYBE ANSWER THIS QUESTION FOR ME.\nWHY IS CHEVRON TRADING SO MUCH HIGHER THAN EXXON MOBIL, CONOCO\nPHILLIPS AND B.P.? >> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.\nI THINK WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE EXXON IS TRADING HIGHER.\nTHESE COMPANIES ARE DUE TO REPORT.\nCHEVRON IS REGARDED AS BEING THE MOST AGGRESSIVE AND FRANKLY IN\nMANY WAYS THE MOST SCIENTIFIC OF ALL OF THE DIFFERENT OIL\nCOMPANIES. BUT EXXON AND CHEVRON ARE UP THE\nSAME AMOUNT. IF YOU ASK ME, I ALWAYS LIKE THE\nCHEVRON GUYS. I THINK THEY OFFER A LOT --\nBRING A LOT TO THE TABLE. BUT MY CHARITABLE TRUST OWNS\nOCCIDENTAL. BETTER YIELD RIGHT NOW, A LITTLE\nBIT BIGGER THAN THESE GUYS, AND I THINK HAS MORE OF AN\nOPPORTUNITY TO BRING OUT VALUE. SO I THINK IF YOU WANT TO BE IN\nTHE PATCH, GO OCCIDENTAL. A LITTLE LESS YIELD THAN\nCHEVRON. LITTLE MORE YIELD THAN EXXON,\nBUT A LOT MORE OPPORTUNITY. ANYWAY, BANKS, ENERGY, AND\nAIRLINES, THREE AREAS OF THE MARKET THAT COULD BE READY FOR A\nSUSTAINED RALLY AFTER BEING OUT IN THE COLD.\nI PRRTLY LIKE THE OIL SERVICE COMPANIES.\n67 MORE AHEAD ON \"MAD MONEY.\" I'M TALKING WITH GROUPON'S CEO\nAFTER A VERY ROUGH EARNINGS REPORT TO SEE ABOUT THE\nE-COMMERCE. THEN WITH STUDENT LOAN DAET AT\n$1.3 TRILLION, I'M TALKING TO ONE PRIVATE COMPANY THAT THINKS\nIT CAN HELP. AND ALL YOUR CALLS RAPID FIRE IN\nTONIGHT'S SPECIAL EDITION OF THE LIGHTNING ROUND.\nSO STICK WITH CRAMER.                \u00e2\u0099\u00aa\u00e2\u0099\u00aa",

              "text": "AFTER SPENDING A LONG TIME IN\nTHE WILDERNESS, GROUPON FINALLY SEEMED TO BE EXECUTING A\nCOMEBACK AND AS OF YESTERDAY, ITS STOCK WAS UP MORE THAN 70%\nYEAR-TO-DATE. THEN WE GOT TWO PIECES OF NEWS.\nGROUPON REPORTED AND ANNOUNCED IT WAS ACQUIRING ITS RIVAL,\nLIVING SOCIAL, FOR AN UNDISCLOSED SUM.\nTHE STOCK GOT TAKEN TO THE WOOD SHED TODAY.\nWHAT WAS SO BAD ABOUT THE QUARTER?\nACTUALLY FRANKLY IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO SAY.\nGROUPON'S TOP LINE AND BOTTOM LINE NUMBERS WERE BOTH SLIGHTLY\nBETTER THAN EXPECTED. THE COMPANY IS GROWING ITS USER\nBASE AND RATIONALIZING ITS GLOBAL FOOTPRINT.\nTHE LIVING SOCIAL DEAL WILL MAKE IT HARDER FOR THEM TO TURN A\nPROFIT AT LEAST IN THE NEAR TERM.\nI THINK THE REAL REASON THE STOCK GOT HIT TODAY IS IT HAD\nRUN UP DRAMATICALLY GOING INTO THE QUARTER.\nIN OTHER WORDS, IT WAS PRICED FOR PERFECTION AND WHAT WE GOT\nWAS MERELY GOOD. SHE WE VIEW THIS AS A POTENTIAL\nBUYING OPPORTUNITY OR DO WE NEED TO WORRY THE TURN AROUND IS\nRUNNING OUT OF STEAM. LET'S CHECK IN WITH RICH\nWILLIAMS. MR. WILLIAMS, WELCOME TO \"MAD\nMONEY.\" GOOD TO SEE YOU SIR.\n>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME. >> YOU HEARD WHAT I JUST SAID.\nHONESTLY I SPENT MOST OF THE DAY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT\nEVERYBODY HATES ABOUT IT, AND I DECIDED THERE WASN'T ANYTHING\nEXCEPT FOR THE FACT IT HAD GONE UP A LOT, AND PEOPLE THOUGHT\nTHIS IS TIME TO BE ABLE TO RING THE REGISTER.\n>> YOUR GUESS IS AS GOOD AS MINE ON THAT ONE.\nI LOOKED AT IT. IT'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT\nCONFUSING. WE HAD A STRONG PERFORMANCE, AS\nYOU SAID, AND THE FUNDAMENTALS IN THE BUSINESS ARE SHOWING\nGREAT PROGRESS. AS WE LOOK AT OUR EXECUTION\nAGAINST OUR STRATEGY, WE'D SAY WE'RE ON TRACK.\nSO, YOU KNOW, I THINK MAYBE THERE WAS SOME FAST MONEY MOVING\nOUT AND SOME PERFECTION EXPECTED.\n>> RIGHT. >> BUT I THINK WE DELIVERED\nSOLID RESULTS. .\n>> LOOK, I THOUGHT TYPICAL FOR THE RESEARCH, CREDIT SUISSE DID\nA GOOD JOB. THEY SAID, IN LINE THIRD\nQUARTER, RESULTS, EXPECT GRADUAL PROGRESS ON TURN AROUND.\nI THINK PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED INSTANT TURN AROUND.\nYOU HAVE NEVER PROMISED THAT.  I'M A PRACTICAL GUY.\nMOST PEOPLE THAT SET OUT ON THE MAGNITUDE OF CHANGE THAT WE SET\nOUT END UP HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ROADS TO RECOVERY THAT ARE\nYEARS LONG. WHEN WE SET OUT, WE SAID THIS\nWASN'T GOING TO BE INSTANT. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE SIMPLE.\nBUT IN THAT PATH, WE'VE ALSO DELIVERED NOW FOUR QUARTERS OF\nREALLY STEADY PROGRESS. YOU LOOK AT OUR NORTH AMERICAN\nLOCAL BUSINESS, OUR CORE BUSINESS, ACCELERATING OVER THE\nLAST THREE QUARTERS. I'D SAY MOST PEOPLE AGAIN -- AND\nTHAT'S BASED ON SAYING THIS IS GOING TO TAKE A WHILE -- BUT\nYOU'RE GOING TO SEE PROGRESS ALONG THE WAY.\nWE'VE BEEN CLEAR ABOUT THAT. >> YOU MADE THE ACQUISITION OF\nLIVING SOCIAL. >> YEAH.\n>> YOU SAID I THINK PRETTY MUCH WHEN I ASKED YOU THIS,\nUNDISCLOSED SUM. BUT TO SOME, THAT WAS RATHER\nRADICAL. I THINK THE MORE RADICAL THING\nWAS TO BE ABLE TO SELL SOME THINGS THAT YOU OWNED OR SHUT\nTHINGS THAT YOU OWNED AND THAT LIVING SOCIAL ACTUALLY FITS INTO\nYOUR CORE MISSION. >> I AGREE WITH YOU.\nWHEN I TOOK OVER THE JOB NOW A YEAR AGO, I BASICALLY SAID,\nLOOK, WE'RE GOING TO DO FOUR THINGS.\nWE'RE GOING TO SIMPLIFY OUR LIVES.\n>> AND YOU DID HAVE A LOT OF STUFF THAT WAS HARD TO\nUNDERSTAND. >> WE HAD A LOT OF STUFF.\nONE OF THOSE KEY STRATEGIC PILLARS WAS SIMPLIFY AND\nSTREAMLINE THE BUSINESS. THAT MEANT REMOVING SOME\nBUSINESSES THAT WEREN'T CORE. >> OKAY.\n>> AND WHEN WE DID THAT, WE ALSO SAID WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO\nBE TUNISTIC ON M&A, WE BELIEVE WE CAN DO BOTH.\nWE BELIEVE WE CAN BE SMART OPERATORS AND ALSO ACQUIRE\nCOMPANIES AS LONG AS THEY PASS A VERY HIGH BAR.\nTHAT HIGH BAR WAS AGAIN SIMPLE. IT SAID THEY HAVE TO BE ON\nSTRATEGY. >> WHICH LIVING SOCIAL\nCERTAINLY. >> IT HAS TO BE DOWN THE MIDDLE\nWITH WHERE OUR FOCUS AREAS ARE AND THAT'S NORTH AMERICAN LOCAL.\nTHAT PASSES THAT BAR. >> WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT THE\nREASON I MENTION THAT IS I WAS LOOKING AT YOUR CASH POSITION.\nYOU HAVE $870 MILLION, ALMOST 40% OF USUAL MARKET CAP.\nI HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT WAS DINGED SUBSTANTIALLY BY BUYING\nLIVING SOESHLG. >> IT WAS A NON-MATERIAL\nACQUISITION. SO, YOU KNOW, WE LOOK AT THAT IN\nMULTIPLE WAYS, BOTH THE FINANCIAL SIDE AND NOW WITH WHAT\nWE KNOW ABOUT INTEGRATING BUSINESSES AND OPERATING THIS\nBUSINESS WELL, WE DON'T SEE IT AS A MATERIAL DISTRACTION FROM\nOUR DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS. WE VERY MUCH LOOK AT THIS DEAL\nAS CAN WE ACQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS AT A COST OF\nACQUISITION THAT WE THINK IS EFFECTIVE?\n>> THIS WAS A MORE INTERNAL INVESTMENT ACQUISITION.\nYOU MADE A DECISION THAT -- >> I MEAN WE LOOK AT IT JUST\nLIKE ANY CUSTOMER ACQUISITION, 12 TO 18 MONTH HORIZON, IS IT\nGOING TO PAY US BACK ON A GROSS PROFIT BASIS.\nIN THIS CASE, WE FEEL STRONGLY THAT IT WILL.\n>> YOU MUST FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT ADVERTISING ON TV BECAUSE I'M\nSEEING THOSE. >> WE DO.\nWE DO. WE'VE BEEN QUIET IN THAT WORLD\nFOR YEARS. AND I THINK, YOU KNOW, IT WAS\nTIME TO GET BACK ON THE AIR. IT WAS TIME TO START EDUCATING\nPEOPLE ABOUT HOW GROUPON HAS CHANGED.\nWE'VE SEEN GREAT RESPONSE TO THAT.\n>> YOU HAVE. TELL ME WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT.\n>> WE'VE SEEN THAT IT CAN BE AN EFFECTIVE CUSTOMER ACQUISITION\nCHANNEL FOR US. WHEN I SAY EFFECTIVE, I'M\nPUTTING THE BRAND STUFF ASIDE. I'M SAYING IF WE MEASURE IT AND\nWE -- DO WE SEE THE ROI WE NEED TO SEE.\nWE MEASURE IT LIKE EFRL CHANNEL WE OPERATE IT.\nWE CAN ACQUIRE A GOOD SIZE NUMBER OF CHARACTERS AT AN ROI\nTHAT WE THINK IS REALLY SOLID. WE TREAT IT LIKE EVERY CHANNEL\nWE OPERATE IN, AND IT HAS THAT EXTRA BENEFIT OF TEACHING PEOPLE\nWHAT'S NEW AT GROUPON. >> RICH, YOU'RE A REGULAR GUY,\nAND YOU'RE ONE GUY TRYING TO TURN AROUND A BIG COMPANY.\nI WONDER EVEN IF THERE WERE TERRIFIC -- AND I KNOW YOU'RE\nGOING TO SAY THERE ARE -- INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WOULD IT\nBE BETTER JUST -- BECAUSE THE THING GOT SO FAR FLUNG.\nJUST SAY, OKAY, LISTEN, I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON DOMESTICS\nBECAUSE THE OPPORTUNITY IS PRETTY GREAT DOMESTICALLY.\n>> I MEAN WE WENT THROUGH EVERY COUNTRY THAT WE OPERATE IN, AND\nWE PUT THEM THROUGH WHAT I THINK IS THE RIGHT FRAMEWORK.\nWE BASICALLY SAID DO WE HAVE A STRONG COMPETITIVE POSITION IN\nTHE MARKET? DOES THE MARKET HAVE\nCHARACTERISTICS THAT WE LIKE? DOES IT HAVE STRONG MOBILE\nPENETRATION? IS IT A CONNECTED MARKET.\nDO WE BELIEVE WE HAVE INVESTMENT CHARACTERISTICS THAT MAKE SENSE\nTHERE? DO WE THINK WE COULD WIN?\nWHERE WE DIDN'T THINK WE COULD WIN, WE MADE THE HARD CALL, CUT\nTHEM OUT. WE THINK WE HAVE A GOOD WINNING\nFORMULA. WE BELIEVE THEY CAN SUPPORT\nINVESTMENT LONG TERM AND BE GOOD SOLID BUSINESSES.\n>> ONE LAST QUESTION. IT'S REALLY UNNERVING WHEN I\nMENTION GROUPON, YOU KNOW. I SAY I THINK THEY'VE BOTTOMED.\nPEOPLE SAID, JIM, GOOGLE COULD WRECK THEM IN A DAY.\n>> YEAH. >> THEY CAN PUT THEM OUT OF\nBUSINESS IN A DAY. WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU HEAR\nTHAT? >> I HEAR THAT ALL THE TIME.\n>> RIGHT? THAT'S THE RUB.\n>> AT LEAST I HEAR THAT IN THE MEDIA SIDE.\nI DON'T REALLY HEAR THAT FROM CUSTOMERS.\nBUT I THINK THE BIG THING YOU HAVE THERE IS CONTEXT.\nAND I THINK IT'S THE CHALLENGE THAT YOU HAVE WITH GOOGLE.\nYOU KNOW, WE OR ANYONE ELSE THAT HAS A DIFFERENT KIND OF CONTEXT,\nPEOPLE GO TO GOOGLE TO FIND STUFF.\nPEOPLE GO TO GROUPON TO BUY LOCALLY.\n>> RIGHT. IT'S DIFFERENT.\n>> IT'S A DIFFERENT ANIMAL. NOW, WE DON'T HAVE THEIR SCALE.\nWE'RE ACQUIRING SCALE AS FAST AS WE POSSIBLY CAN.\nBUT WHEN PEOPLE THINK OF GROUPON, THEY THINK I'M GOING TO\nGO FIND A GREAT RESTAURANT. I'M GOING TO GO FIND A GREAT\nSPA. I'M GOING TO DO SOMETHING WITH\nMY KIDS THIS WEEKEND. I'M GOING TO SAVE A TON OF\nMONEY. CHANGING THAT, INCREDIBLY HARD\nTO DO. >> WE'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT.\nYOU ANSWERED A LOT OF MY QUESTIONS.\nI REALLY APPRECIATE IT. THAT'S GROUPON'S CEO RICH\nWILLIAMS. I THINK THE STOCK IS REALLY INTERESTING DOWN SO BADLY TODAY\nBECAUSE THERE REALLY WASN'T ANYTHING THAT SHOULD MAKE IT GO\nDOWN LIKE THAT. \"MAD MONEY\" IS BACK AFTER THE\nBREAK. >> IT IS TIME!\nIT IS TIME FOR THE LIGHTNING ROUND!\nTHAT'S WHERE I TAKE YOUR CALLS RAPID FIRE.\nYOU TELL ME THE STOCK. I TELL YOU TO BUY, BUY, BUY OR\nSELL, SELL, SELL. WE'LL PLAY THIS SOUND --\n[ BUZZER ] -- AND THEN THE LIGHTNING ROUND\nIS OVER. ARE YOU READY, SKEE-DADDY?\nIT'S TIME FOR THE LIGHTNING ROUND ON CRAMER'S \"MAD MONEY.\"\nLET'S START WITH SCOTT IN NORTH DAKOTA, SCOTT.\n>> Caller: HELLO, JIM. >> YO, YO.\n>> Caller: HOW YOU DOING TODAY? >> GOOD.\nHOW ABOUT YOU? >> Caller: GOOD, GOOD.\nTHANKS FOR TAKING MY CALL AND THANKS FOR YOUR SHOW.\nI'VE LEARNED A LOT FROM YOU. >> THANK YOU.\n>> Caller: MY STOCK IS FIRE EYE. I KEEP ON BUYING IT AS IT'S\nGOING DOWN, AND IT'S REALLY DOWN THERE NOW.\n>> MAYBE AT SOME POINT. I CAN'T RECOMMEND THE STOCK ON A\nTAKEOVER BASIS BECAUSE THE FUNDAMENTALS AREN'T THAT GOOD.\nTHE ONE I'VE BEEN LIKING IS PROOFPOINT BECAUSE THAT DOES THE\nE-MAIL BLOCKAGE WHICH IS WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO WORRY ABOUT RIGHT\nNOW. CRAIG IN MINNESOTA, CRAIG.\n>> Caller: BIG BOOYAH FROM MINNESOTA THERE, JIM.\n>> ALL RIGHT. SORRY WE HAD TO BEAT THE VIKINGS\nLAST WEEKEND, BUT THAT'S SOMETIMES THE WAY IT IS.\nWHAT'S GOING ON? >> Caller: WELL, I GOT SHOPPER\nFLY, TICKER SYMBOL SHOP. >> YOU KNOW, IT'S UP TOO MUCH.\nIT'S UP TOO MUCH. IT'S UP 60%.\nTHAT MAKES ME NERVOUS. I KNOW IT'S DOING WELL, BUT IT\nIS UP TOO MUCH, AND I WANT TO BE A LITTLE CAUTIOUS HERE.\nLET'S GO TO RANDY IN NEW YORK, RANDY.\n>> Caller: THANKS FOR TAKING MY CALL.\n>> OF COURSE. >> Caller: I'M INTERESTED IN\nIMPEGY. BUY SELL OR HOLD.\n>> WE DID A PIECE SAYING IF IT PULLED BACK, WE WOULD BE A\nBUYER. IT'S PULLED BACK.\nIT'S GETTING KIND OF INTERESTING.\nHOW ABOUT ALEX IN CALIFORNIA, ALEX?\n>> Caller: BOOYAH, JIM. >> BOOYAH.\n>> Caller: HOW ABOUT SIGN DOZIER?\n>> NO. MY CHARITABLE TRUST OWNS\nALLERGAN. IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN THAT\nBUT ALLERGAN IS GOING TO COME DOWN A FEW MORE POINTS AS WE GET\nINTO THE ELECTION. DAVID IN MASSACHUSETTS, DAVID.\n>> Caller: JIM, BOOYAH. >> BOOYAH.\n>> Caller: I WAS WONDERING YOUR THOUGHTS ON ERII, IT'S BEEN\nPERFORMING WELL THE PAST YEAR BUT --\n>> YEAH. YOU KNOW, LET ME DO MORE WORK ON\nTHAT BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A FASCINATING COMPANY.\nWE GOT A LOT OF HOMEWORK TO DO. LET ME DO WORK ON THAT.\nGEORGE IN FLORIDA, GEORGE. >> Caller: HI.\nI WAS THINK -- WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT ZOE'S KITCHEN?\n>> ZOE'S KITCHEN DID NOT DO WHAT I WANTED, WHICH IS TO SAY NOT AS\nBAD AS I THOUGHT. I LIKE THE LONG TERM THESIS,\nTHOUGH. IF YOU HAVE THE PATIENCE FOR A\nYEAR, I THINK THAT ZOE'S IS GOING TO MAKE YOU MONEY BECAUSE\nIT'S FRESH FOOD, AND IT'S GOT A GREAT CONCEPT.\nBUT IT MIGHT TAKE A YEAR TO RECOVER BECAUSE WHEN THESE\nRESTAURANT STOCKS GO WRONG, THEY STAY DOWN.\nVIDULA IN CALIFORNIA, VIDULA. >> Caller: HI, JIM.\nNICE TALKING TO YOU. >> SAME.\n>> Caller: BUY MORE OR SELL? >> WE JUST HIT THE JACKPOT WITH\nNXP ON MY CHARITABLE TRUST. NOW I'M LOOKING AT NVIDIA.\nONE MORE CALL. CHARLIE IN VIRGINIA, CHARLIE.\n>> Caller: THANKS, JIM. I'M A LONG TIME FAN AND A FELLOW\nB AND B OWNER. >> REALLY?\n>> Caller: IN NOVEMBER 2014, YOU DISCUSSED TICKER PAY AND\nDISCUSSED HOW EVERY RETAILER WOULD NEED A NEW CREDIT CARD\nMACHINE. >> BUT THEN I PULLED IT WHEN IT\nTURNED OUT THEY COULDN'T MAKE ANY MONEY IN THE 20s, I SAID\nTHIS ONE WAS A BAD ONE, AND IT REMAINS A BAD ONE.\nTHEY JUST WEREN'T ALLOWED TO MAKE ANY MONEY IN THIS DARN\nTHING. WHAT CAN I SAY?\nAND THAT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IS THE CONCLUSION OF THE\nLIGHTNING ROUND!",

I AGREE WITH ALICE THAT I DO\nTHINK IT'S A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE.\nI'M GLAD SHE IS SAYING SHE IS 100% CONFIDENT IN OUR ELECTORAL\nPROCESS. I KNOW MANY REPUBLICANS HAVE\nSAID THAT AND REPUDIATED DONALD TRUMP'S IRRESPONSIBLE TALK OF A\nRIGGED SYSTEM. BUT LET'S ALSO ADMIT HERE THAT\nDONALD TRUMP'S RHETORIC HAS FED INTO THE KIND OF LANGUAGE THAT\nWE ARE SEEING FROM THE SMALL PERCENTAGE OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS.\nIT HAS FED INTO THE KIND OF PASSION THAT THEY FEEL ABOUT HIS\nWINNING AND ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THEIR UNFORTUNATE FEELINGS ABOUT\nHILLARY CLINTON. BUT I THINK AT THE END OF THE\nDAY, I AM GOING TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN NOT JUST THE\nELECTORAL PROCESS BUT IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT THEY WILL\nUNDERSTAND AND KNOW THAT THE DEMOCRACY THAT WE HAVE HERE IN\nTHIS COUNTRY IS SOMETHING TO BE VALUED OVER EVERYTHING BUT\nDONALD TRUMP HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO RACHET DOWN\nTHE RHETORIC OF RIGGED ELECTIONS, TO RACHET DOWN THE\nRHETORIC OF LOCK HER UP, TO RACHET DOWN THE RHETORIC OF\nINCITING VIOLENCE AT HIS OWN RALLIES AND FOCUS ON MAKING SURE\nTHAT WHATEVER TRANSITION HAPPENS, THAT IT IS SMOOTH.\n>> RIGHT. OKAY.\nSO THERE'S A TINY SIGN THAT AT LEAST TRUMP'S RUNNING MATE MIKE\nPENCE IS CONCERNED, BECAUSE HE CAME FACE TO FACE WITH AN IOWA\nVOTER WHO HAD SOME VERY STRONG COMMENTS ABOUT A POSSIBLE TRUMP\nLOSS AND HERE'S HOW HE RESPONDED.\n>> I DON'T WANT THIS TO HAPPEN BUT I WILL TELL YOU FROM ME\nPERSONALLY, IF HILLARY CLINTON GETS IN, I MYSELF, I'M READY FOR\nA REVOLUTION BECAUSE WE CAN'T HAVE HER IN.\n>> YEAH. YOU DON'T -- DON'T SAY THAT.\n>> I'M JUST SAYING IT. NO, I'M LIKE TRUMP.\nAM I NOT SAYING THE TRUTH, GUYS? COME ON.\n>> THERE'S A REVOLUTION COMING ON NOVEMBER 8th.\nI PROMISE YOU. >> SO JASON, MIKE PENCE APPEARS\nTO BE TRYING TO TAMP DOWN EMOTION.\n>> I THINK TO BE FAIR, YOU HAVE TO SAY THERE ARE PEOPLE ON BOTH\nSIDES WHO ARE SAYING THE OPPOSING CANDIDATE IS A THREAT\nTO DEMOCRACY. THAT'S THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE\nARE IN RIGHT NOW. AND ALSO FEEDING INTO THIS ARE\nTHE DAILY WIKILEAKS INFORMATION THAT'S COMING, THAT'S RAISING\nPEOPLE'S CONCERN ABOUT THE CORRUPT WASHINGTON WAYS AND\nTHEY'RE JUST CONFUSED. I THINK MANY PEOPLE, WHERE DO\nYOU CHANNEL THAT IF YOU END UP LOSING THE ELECTION.\n>> THAT BRINGS UP SAY HILLARY CLINTON DOES WIN THE ELECTION,\nALICE, HOW DO YOU GOVERN IN THAT KIND OF CLIMATE WHEN THERE'S A\nCERTAIN SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION WHO THINKS YOU'RE A\nCROOK, RIGHT, AND THEN THERE'S A CERTAIN SEGMENT OF THE\nPOPULATION WHO JUST DOESN'T LIKE OR TRUST YOU?\n>> WELL, REGARDLESS OF WHO IT IS, IT'S GOING TO BE A DIFFICULT\nTIME. CLEARLY DONALD TRUMP HAS TAPPED\nINTO TREMENDOUS FRUSTRATION AMONGST MANY VOTERS AND HE'S\nGIVEN THEM A VOICE TO SPEAK OUT AND SPEAK THEIR MIND IN THIS\nELECTION. AND REGARDLESS OF WHO IT IS,\nWITH ALL OF THE ANGER AND THE EMOTION SURROUNDING THIS\nELECTION, IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT FOR THEM LEADING AND I\nHOPE THAT WHOEVER IT IS, WHETHER IT'S DONALD TRUMP OR HILLARY\nCLINTON, GIVEN ALL THE INFORMATION WE HAVE COMING OUT\nABOUT BOTH OF THEM OVER THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS AND MONTHS, THAT\nTHEY DO BRING ABOUT NEW LEADERSHIP IN THIS COUNTRY THAT\nIS MORE BIPARTISAN. I DON'T THINK BARACK OBAMA HAS\nDONE A GOOD JOB OF BRINGING BOTH SIDES TOGETHER AND WORKING FOR A\nCONSENSUS ON MANY, MANY ISSUES. WHETHER IT'S DONALD TRUMP OR\nHILLARY CLINTON, I HOPE WE SEE SOME TYPE OF LEADERSHIP THAT\nHELPS TO BRIDGE THE DIVIDE WHICH HAS BEEN SO GREAT IN THIS\nELECTION BECAUSE WE NEED TO SEE THIS COUNTRY COMING TOGETHER.\n>> MARIA, I THINK THAT MANY PEOPLE AGREE WITH ALICE BUT THEY\nDON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING WITH EITHER CANDIDATE.\n>> WELL, I WILL SAY THIS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON HAD GOING FOR HER IN THE SENATE AND MANY REPUBLICANS HAVE\nSAID THIS IS THAT SHE REALLY DID HAVE THE ABILITY TO WORK ACROSS\nTHE AISLE AND MANY REPUBLICAN SENATORS WILL SAY THAT AND STILL\nDO SAY THAT TO THIS DAY. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SHE HAS\nBEEN TALKING ABOUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\nSHE'S THE ONE WHO IS TALKING ABOUT BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER.\nSHE IS THE ONE WHOSE SLOGAN IS STRONGER TOGETHER, MAKING SURE\nWE LIFT EACH OTHER UP INSTEAD OF TEARING EACH OTHER DOWN.\nSO AGAIN, THE CANDIDATES' RHETORIC REALLY DOES MATTER AND\nTRUMP IS THE ONE WHO HAS FOCUSED ON SPLITTING US.\nHE'S THE ONE WHO HAS TALKED ABOUT RIGGED ELECTIONS.\nHE'S EVEN TALKED IN A NOT SO NUANCED WAY ABOUT QUOTE, SECOND\nAMENDMENT PEOPLE TAKING CARE OF HILLARY CLINTON IF SHE'S\nELECTED. THAT IS NOT THE KIND OF RHETORIC\nTHAT WE NEED HERE. THIS IS A MOMENT WHERE YOUR\nLEADERSHIP SKILLS REALLY ARE EITHER VISIBLE OR PEOPLE\nUNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE UNFIT TO LEAD.\n>> HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE.",

HE'LL ACCEPT THAT, AND HE SEEMS\nTO BE A LITTLE BIT STUCK ON THE IDEA THAT IF THERE IS A 100-VOTE\nDIFFERENCE IN FLORIDA, OF COURSE SOMEONE IS GOING TO CONTEST\nTHAT, THEY'RE GOING TO RECOUNT AND SO FORTH.\nI JUST THINK IT'S A BIT OF A DISTRACTION.\nI DON'T AGREE WITH THAT DISTRACTION, BUT I WILL TELL YOU\nHE GAVE A GREAT SPEECH IN OHIO TODAY.\nHE GAVE A LOT OF REASONS WHY PEOPLE SHOULD VOTE FOR HIM AS\nOPPOSED IT HILLARY AND MICHELLE OBAMA TALKING ABOUT REASONS WHY\nTHEY SHOULD VOTE AGAINST DONALD TRUMP.\nNOW, DONALD TRUMP BROUGHT UP SOME -- GO AHEAD.\n>> I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THIS BECAUSE I ACTUALLY WAS TALKING\nTO SOME FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN TRYING TO HELP DONALD TRUMP OUT,\nAND THEIR BIGGEST COMPLAINT IS THAT TRUMP DOESN'T SPEND ENOUGH\nTIME TALKING ABOUT GIVING VOTERS A REASON TO VOTE FOR HIM.\nYOU SAY HE SAYS THAT. AS YOU CAN SEE, HE SPENT A LOT\nOF TIME BASHING THE CLINTONS. WHAT ARE THE BEST THREE REASONS\nTO VOTE FOR TRUMP, IN YOUR OPINION, THAT DON'T HAVE\nANYTHING TO DO WITH THE CLINTONS?\n>> WELL, YOU CAN ALWAYS CONTRAST IT, BUT IT'S PUTTING AMERICA\nFIRST AND THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH SAYING THE CLINTONS PUT\nTHEMSELVES FIRST IN THE SAME BREATH BUT PUT AMERICA FIRST.\nSECURE OUR BORDERS, AND HILLARY HAS SAID SHE STANDS FOR OPEN\nBORDERS, SO THAT CONTRAST IS OKAY.\nON DEFEATING ISIS, ACCURATELY POINTING OUT WHY ISIS IS THERE,\nBECAUSE OF FAILURES IN OUR FOREIGN POLICIES CERTAINLY IN\nIRAQ AND SYRIA. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH\nGIVING THE PEOPLE THE REASONS FOR JOBS, JOBS AND JOBS, SECURE\nOUR BORDERS, STAND UP AND DEFEAT ISIS.\nAT THE SAME TIME, CONTRASTING TO HILLARY CLINTON THE SPEECH SHE\nGAVE IN OHIO TODAY, I JUST WISH HE HAD BEEN GIVING THAT SPEECH\nTHE LAST 60 DAYS. HE WOULD HAVE THIS ELECTION IN\nTHE BAG. WE DO HAVE 12 MORE DAYS TO GO,\nAND WE'VE SEEN, AT ONE POINT FOUR DAYS AGO, THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN WAS BASICALLY DECLARING VICTORY, AND OH, MY GOD, THEY'VE\nCOME ALL THE WAY BACK. NEVADA IS BACK IN PLAY.\nHE'S LEADING IN FLORIDA. >> I WANT TO TALK ABOUT\nSOMETHING ELSE DONALD TRUMP SAID ON ABC.\nIT HAS TO DO WITH THE RUSSIAN ISSUE.\nHERE IT IS AND LET ME GET TO YOU REACT TO IT.\n>> INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES BELIEVE THE RUSSIANS ARE BEHIND THAT\nLEAK. WHY DON'T YOU BELIEVE IT?\n>> I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE BEHIND IT AND I BELIEVE IT'S\nPUBLIC RELATIONS. PEOPLE ARE HACKING ALL OVER THE\nPLACE. >> CONGRESSMAN COLLINS, YOU'RE\nNOT ON THE REPUBLICAN COMMITTEE, BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE ON THE\nREPUBLICAN COMMITTEE BOTH IN THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE.\nDONALD TRUMP IS BEING BRIEFED ON THIS, IS BEING TOLD ESSENTIALLY\nTHE RUSSIANS ARE BEHIND THIS. WHY IS HE CALLING OUR\nPROFESSIONAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES INTO QUESTION, AND DOES\nTHAT CONCERN YOU? >> I DON'T THINK IT CONCERNS ME,\nBECAUSE THEY CAN'T SAY WITH 100%.\nI DO AGREE, THE RUSSIANS ARE PROBABLY BEHIND THE HACKING, SO\nI DO TEND TO ACCEPT THAT. EVEN THE SECURITY OFFICIALS WILL\nSAY IT'S 99%, NOT 100. AGAIN, I WISH THAT'S SOMETHING\nMR. TRUMP WOULD MOVE OFF OF. .\nAND THIS $116 MILLION THAT WENT TO BILL CLINTON, THEY'RE CALLING\nHIM BUBBA AND SAYING THIS IS ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE ISSUES THAT\nTHE CLINTON FAMILY FIRST AND, BUT I DON'T DISAGREE, AND I WILL\nTELL YOU AGAIN, IF HE GAVE THE SPEECH HE GAVE IN OHIO TODAY, HE\nWOULD BE IN THE LEAD, AND FOR ME AS A SUPPORTER, I HOPE IT STAYS\nTHAT WAY THE NEXT 12 DAYS. >> I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT\nSOMETHING JASON CHAVITS HAS SAID ABOUT A COUPLE THINGS.\nHE'S GONE BACK AND FORTH ENDORSING DONALD TRUMP.\nTHEN HE SAID HE WASN'T ENDORSING HIM BUT HE WAS VOTING FOR HIM.\nI'LL LET OTHERS SAY HOW WE REDEFINE THOSE WORDS THESE DAYS.\nHE SAID HE WAS GETTING READY TO INVESTIGATE HILLARY CLINTON AS\nPRESIDENT. YOU SAY THE BRAKES NEED TO BE\nTAPPED ON THAT. EXPLAIN WHAT YOUR CONCERN WAS\nABOUT THAT LANGUAGE. >> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A DIVIDED\nNATION AT THE END OF THIS ELECTION REGARDLESS OF WHO WINS.\nWE'RE DIVIDED RIGHT NOW. WE NEED THIS NATION TO HEAL.\nWE NEED TO DO THAT BY TALKING ABOUT ISSUES, SOME CERTAIN LEVEL\nOF COMPROMISE ALTHOUGH IT WILL BE DIFFERENT TO COMPROMISE A\nREPUBLICAN CONSERVATIVE AGENDA WITH THAT WHICH WOULD BE A\nPROGRESSIVE SOCIALIST AGENDA, BUT I DO BELIEVE THERE ARE SOME\nAREAS, CORPORATE TAX REFORM IS ONE.\nIF WE TAKE AWAY CITIZENSHIP FOR THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, I THINK\nWE CAN PUT TOGETHER A VERY STRONG IMMIGRATION PACKAGE.\nBUT I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO START RIGHT AWAY IF MRS. CLINTON\nWAS ELECTED AND MAKE IT APPEAR, YOU KNOW, THAT THERE IS A WITCH\nHUNT. NOW, SHE DOES NEED TO ANSWER TO\nSOME THINGS. THERE MAY BE SOME ISSUES THAT\nHAVE COME UP THAT WE WOULD LIKE ANSWERS TO.\nHOPEFULLY THOSE WOULD BE FORTHCOMING.\nBUT IF SHE IS ELECTED PRESIDENT, SHE'LL SERVE FOR FOUR YEARS.\nI'M GOING TO BE THE OPTIMIST THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER ON\nSOME AREAS, BUT THAT WILL IN MANY CASES DEPEND ON HER\nRHETORIC AND HOW SHE MOVES FORWARD.\n>> LET ME ASK YOU THIS. HOW DIVISIVE INSIDE THE\nREPUBLICAN CONFERENCE IS SUPPORT FOR TRUMP OR NOT TRUMP MEAN FOR\nPOST ELECTION? DOES PAUL RYAN HAVE PROBLEMS\nINSIDE YOUR CONFERENCE? DOES HE HAVE THE CONFIDENCE OF\nENOUGH REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE TO STAY SPEAKER AFTER THIS\nELECTION IF YOU GUYS HOLD THE MAJORITY?\n>> I DO, CHUCK. PAUL RYAN HAS DONE A FABULOUS\nJOB IN KEEPING OUR CONFERENCE UNITED.\nHE IS A VERY OPEN PROCESS AND THEY'RE GOING WITH 4:00 IN THE\nAFTERNOON RATHER THAN 6:00. >> YOU WILL NOT BLAME PAUL RYAN\nFOR A TRUMP LOSS. >> NO, NOT AT ALL.\nHE WAS LUKEWARM FROM THE BEGINNING, AND HIS FOCUS HAS\nBEEN ON MAKING SURE WE HAVE A MAJORITY AND THE BIGGEST\nMAJORITY WE CAN HAVE GOING INTO THE NEXT CONGRESS, AND SO THAT'S\nBEEN HIS FOCUS AND I'M FINE WITH THAT, AND OUR CONFERENCE IS\nUNITED BEHIND HIM. FRANKLY, I'M NOT SURE ANYONE\nELSE WOULD WANT THAT JOB, IT'S THE MOST DIFFICULT JOB IN THE\nWORLD. >> YOU JUST CRACKED UP THE\nENTIRE PANEL HERE WITH THAT ANSWER THERE.\nANYWAY, CONGRESSMAN CHRIS COLLINS FOR WESTERN NEW YORK,\nALWAYS APPRECIATE YOU COMING ON THE SHOW AND SHARING YOUR VIEWS.\n>> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU. >> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU, TOO.\nYOU GUYS STARTED TO GIGGLE ON THAT LINE.\nCHIEF CORRESPONDENT POLITICO AND SENIOR POLITICO REPORTER SUSAN\nPAGE FROM USA TODAY. GLEN, YOUR CHUCKLE WAS THE\nLOUDEST, I THINK. >> IT'S FLOSSING THE ALLIGATORS\nAT THE ZOO JOB, RIGHT? >> NOBODY WANTS THAT JOB.\nIT'S INTERESTING TO HEAR CHRIS COLLINS.\nI'VE HEARD THIS FROM MORE AND MORE TRUMP SUPPORTERS.\nTHEY SOUND MORE LIKE HIM. THEY'RE LAMENTING.\n>> YES. HE ACTUALLY SAID IT WILL BE A\nWITCH HUNT. HE LAID OUT WHAT WE COULD DO\nWITH HILLARY CLINTON. >> HE SHORT-CIRCUITED IT, BUT\nI'LL CLARIFY WHEN HE SAID YOU HAVE TO MAKE A PATH TO\nCITIZENSHIP. THE PATH TO LEGALIZATION RATHER\nTHAN THE PATH TO CITIZENSHIP HAS ALWAYS BEEN A STICKY POINT.\n>> WE CAN WORK TOGETHER WITH HER ON SOME ISSUES, WE CAN\nINVESTIGATE EVERYTHING. THERE ARE SOME WHO WANT TO HAVE\nMORE. WE TALKED TO OTHERS WHO SAID NO,\nIT WAS THE WHOLE CAUCUS. YOU HEARD ALMOST A WHOLE TRUMP\nVISION FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, WHICH I WAS STRUCK BY.\n>> I WAS, TOO. SUSAN, AS I'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW\nCHRIS COLLINS A LITTLE BIT, HE'S SORT OF THE ANGEL ON TRUMP'S\nSHOULDER. IF TRUMP IS RESHAPING OUR\nREPUBLICAN PARTY, NOT DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF BUT THE NEW TRUMP\nVOTERS, CHRIS COLLINS IS REPRESENTATIVE OF WESTERN NEW\nYORK, BLUE COLLAR DISTRICT, REALLY, THEY DON'T CARE AS MUCH\nABOUT THE SOCIAL ISSUES. HE COULD BE A GUY TO WATCH HERE.\n>> WHO IS THE DEVIL ON THE OTHER SHOULDER?\n>> POSSIBLY ROGER STONE. >> HERE IS WHERE IT'S\nINTERESTING. A BIG SUPPORTER OF TRUMP, RIGHT?\n>> FIRST GUY IN CONGRESS TO SUPPORT HIM.\n>> HE IS PREPARED TO MOVE PAST TRUMP.\nHE'S BASICALLY SAYING HE MAY WELL LOSE, AND IF HE LOSES, WE\nNEED TO BE COOPERATIVE, WE NEED TO TRY SOME COMPROMISES, WE NEED\nTO DELAY GOING AFTER THE NEW PRESIDENT.\n12 DAYS UNTIL THE ELECTION. IT'S NOT LIKE THE ELECTION IS\nTHIS AFTERNOON. >> CAN YOU IMAGINE EVEN A\nHYPOTHETICAL? THEN HE HAD THIS LAMENT ON IF HE\nHAD ADOPTED THE TONE, LOOK WHERE WE WOULD BE.\nA LOT OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS ARE MOVING PAST HIM BUT THE POINT\nYOU MAKE ABOUT THE COE MESSAGE AND TRUMP OUTLASTING TRUMP, I\nTHINK YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT COLLINS.\nHE'S GOT THAT LASTING MESSAGE. >> I'LL BE CURIOUS TO WATCH HIM\nAND A FEW OTHERS. I WANT TO GO TO THIS JASON\nCHAVITZ THING. HOW MUCH HE SAID YESTERDAY FELT\nLIKE THE FIRST CAMPAIGN PITCH TO SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE?\nI DON'T MEAN TO BE THAT CYNICAL ABOUT IT, BUT IS IT?\n>> I SORT OF READ McCAIN'S COMMENTS THAT WE'LL BLOCK\nEVERYTHING FOREVER, TED CRUZ'S COMMENTS THAT WE ONLY NEED EIGHT\nPEOPLE, ALL THIS POSITIONING FOR THE FUTURE SHOWING THAT THEY'RE\nGOING TO BE FIRING AGAINST HILLARY, MAKING SURE THE BASE\nKNOWS THAT TED CRUZ IS GOING TO RUN FOR REELECTION IN 2018.\nI THINK OF THOSE THINGS AS MORE POSITIONING AND THEY DON'T\nNECESSARILY REFLECT WHAT THE PARTIES WILL DO.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT MICHELLE OBAMA.\nSOMEBODY SAID THIS IN MULTIPLE  THERE IS ONE WINNER IN THIS\nELECTION. IT'S MICHELLE OBAMA.\nSHE HAS TURNED INTO THE STAR. >> WHO IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT\nAT THAT RALLY? WHO SEEMED LIKE THE PERSON\nRUNNING FOR PRESIDENT? SHE'S JUST SO GOOD ON THE STUMP.\nIT'S NOT LIKE SHE'S HAD TONS OF PRACTICE BECAUSE SHE'S DONE\nRELATIVELY FEW OF THESE. ONLY WHEN SHE NEEDS TO DO IT\nWILL SHE DO IT. >> THIS ELECTION IS OBAMA'S\nVISION OF AMERICA AND TRUMP'S VISION OF AMERICA AND IT JUST\nHAPPENS TO BE HILLARY CLINTON AS THE NOMINEE.\n>> IT ALMOST SEEMS LIKE MICHELLE OBAMA OUGHT TO BE THE NOMINEE,\nRIGHT? JUST IN TERMS OF HER\nPERFORMANCE. >> PERFORMANCEWISE, YES.\n>> PEOPLE FORGET THAT IN CHARLOTTE IN 2012, SHE PROBABLY\nGAVE THE BEST SPEECH OF THAT CONVENTION.\nBILL CLINTON OVERSHADOWED HER. AND I THOUGHT IN 2016, SHE\nCLEARLY HAD THE BEST SPEECH. >> SHE HAD THE BEST ANTI-TRUMP\nSPEECH, TOO, DURING THIS CAMPAIGN AND THE SPEECH SHE GAVE\nAFTER THE RELEASE OF ACCESS HOLLYWOOD.\n>> AND SHE'S SO FOCUSED. SHE'S IN THESE PLACES AND\nREMINDING VOTERS, AND WE JUST SAW NUMBERS COME OUT, THAT THE\nTURNOUT IN VIRGINIA HAS NOT BEEN GREAT IN THE EARLY VOTING.\nSHE IS ALWAYS SUCH A FOCUSED SURROGATE.\nSHE ALWAYS MAKES SURE TO MAKE THE CLOSING ARGUMENT.\n>> YOU WANT ONE LAST POINT? >> TODAY'S SPEECH, HILLARY\nINTRODUCED MICHELLE. SHE WAS WITH MICHELLE FOR ABOUT\n30 MINUTES. SHE MENTIONED THE VOTERS\nOPPRESSION STORY WAS OUT TLT. IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND -- SHE\nSORT OF WORKED THE NEWS IN",

IT'S TO DONALD TRUMP'S BENEFIT\nTO START UNPACKING IT FOR AMERICANS.\n>> JAY, THEY'RE ADMITTING THAT THEY KNOW THIS ENTIRE ISSUE IS\nCORRUPT.

HIS STAFF -- NOW BECAUSE OF\nWIKILEAKS, THE STAFF REPORTING OF WHAT WAS GOING ON INTERNALLY\nINSIDE THE CAMPAIGN IS NOW MADE PUBLIC FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD\nTO SEE. AND IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE THE\nLINES GO -- WHICH IS NOT A COMPLICATED CONNECT THE DOTS.\nTHE FACT IS WHAT WAS GOING ON -- YOU MENTIONED THE FBI SITUATION.\nI MEAN THE FBI SHOULD BE EMBARRASSED.\nNOW THE NUMBER TWO GUY AT THE FBI GETS PROMOTED AFTER AL OF\nTHIS MESS, HIS WIFE WAS RUNNING TO BE A STATE SENATE SEAT AND\nTHE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA POURS IN BETWEEN THE DNC AND PACTS\n700,000, 800,000 DOLLARS FOR A STATE SENATE SEAT WHICH CHE\nLOSES AND THEN HE GETS PROMOTED. IN ANOTHER UNIVERSE AT ANOTHER\nTIME, THIS WOULD BE A VERY DIFFERENT SITUATION.\nBUT I GO BACK TO STAY -- YOU'RE COMING UP TO THE MOST IMPORTANT\nTEN DAYS OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.\nTHIS IS IT. THE FINAL TEN DAYS IS TWO DAYS\nAWAY FOR BOTH CLINTON AND TRUMP. THEY'VE GOT TO HIT THEIR\nMESSAGES.

HE CANNOT DISTRACT THE MEDIA'S\nATTENTION AWAY FROM THINGS LIKE THE DOUG BAN MEMO, THIS\nWIKILEAKS INFORMATION THAT SURFACED WITH, THE FACT THAT\nPRESIDENT OBAMA MIGHT HAVE KNOWN ABOUT HER PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER\nALL ALONG.

ROOSEVELT AND THE LAND OF\nAMERICA. MR. DERSHOWITZ, HILLARY CLINTON\nHAS NEVER MENTIONED THIS CLINTON, INC MEMO.\nDO THE CLINTONS DO ANYTHING ILLEGAL IN WHAT WE JUST SAW?\n>> NO, NOTHING ILLEGAL. SHE MADE NO SINGLE DECISION\nBASED ON CONTRIBUTIONS BUT THEY HAVE TO LOOK TO THE FUTURE.\nIF I WERE HILLARY CLINTON, I WOULD SAY IF ELECTED PRESIDENT,\nMY HUSBAND WILL NOT ACCEPT A SINGLE PENNY FOR SPEAKING FEES\nDURING THE FOUR OR EIGHT YEARS ON PRESIDENT, THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION WILL BE PUT INTO THE HANDS OF VERY OBJECTIVE, NOBEL\nPRIZE WINNING, WHATEVER AND WE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.\nIF SHE SAYS ANYTHING, SHE SHOULD LOOK TO THE FUTURE AND ASSURE\nTHE AMERICAN PUBLIC THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED IN THE PAST,\nIS NO PROBLEM FOR THE FUTURE. >> SO TALK NOT JUST BE QUIET?\n>> I THINK SHE SHOULD TALK BUT ONLY ABOUT THE FUTURE.\n>> OF COURSE DONALD TRUMP IS USING IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY AS HE\nSHOULD, RIGHT? >> SURE.\n>> AS HER OPPONENT WHO WAS QUICK TO PILE ON TODAY, LISTEN TO\nTHIS. >> JUST TODAY WE READ ABOUT\nCLINTON CONFIDENT DOUG BRAND BRAGGING THAT HE HAD FUNNELED\nTENS OF MILLIONS TO BILL CLINTON, INC THROUGH THE\nFOUNDATION DONATIONS, PAID SPEECHES AND CONSULTING\nCONTRACTS. MR. BAND CALLED THE ARRANGEMENT\nUNOR UNORTHODOX.\nTHE REST OF US CALL IT OUTRIGHT CORRUPT.\nIF THE CLINTONS WERE WILLING TO PLAY THIS FAST AND LOOSE WITH\nTHEIR ENTERPRISE, WHEN THEY WEREN'T IN THE WHITE HOUSE, JUST\nIMAGINE WHAT THEY'LL DO GIVEN THE CHANCE TO CONTROL THE OVAL\nOFFICE. >> OUTRIGHT CORRUPT ALLEN IS\nTHAT ACCURATE OR ARE THESE PRACTICES CORRUPT?\n>> THEY'RE UNSEEMING AND THEY CREATE AN APPEARANCE THE\nAMERICAN PUBLIC IS ENTITLED TO LOOK AT BUT COMING FROM DONALD\nTRUMP MAKING THESE ARGUMENTS, LOOKING AT IT HIS HISTORY, IF HE\nWOULD BRING TO THE WHITE HOUSE THE WAY HE HAS CONDUCTED\nBUSINESS THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER, IT WOULD BE FAR WORSE SO ONE HAS\nTO ALWAYS MAKE COMPARATIVE JUDGES.\n>> YOU HEARD HIM MENTION DOUG BAND, HOW HE HELPED RUN WHAT HE\nCALLED CLINTON , INC, PULLING I LUCRATIVE DEALS FOR IN-KIND\nSERVICES FOR HOSPITALITY, VACATION AND THE LIKE S. THAT\nSTANDARD PRACTICE, IN-KIND SERVICES?\n>> WHAT WAS GOING ON HERE WAS SUSTAINING A LIFESTYLE THAT BILL\nCLINTON HAD BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO, FLYING AROUND THE WORLD,\nCOLLECTING LARGE SUMS OF MONEY FOR TALKS AND SPEECHES, STAYING\nAT FIVE STAR HOTELS, AND YEAH, IT IS THE GAP BETWEEN THE\nRHETORIC THAT HILLARY CLINTON AND DEMOCRATS HAVE USED ABOUT\nTHE PROBLEM OF MONEY AND POLITICS OF UNDUE INFLUENCE FOR\nSPECIAL INTERESTS AND WEALTHY DONORS AND THEN THE REALITY OF\nSPECIAL INTERESTS AND WEALTHY DONORS POURING THIS KIND OF\nMONEY INTO THE FAMILY FOUNDATION, THROUGH THESE SUMS\nPAID TO BILL CLINTON IS PRETTY LARGE AND THAT'S WHERE THIS IS\nAT ISSUE AND IS A PROBLEM. IT'S -- AND IT HAS BEEN FOR THE\nCLINTONS FOR A LONG TIME. THE GAP BETWEEN THE HIGH-MINDED\nRHETORIC THEY ESPOUSE AND HILLARY CLINTON CERTAINLY\nESPOUSED AND THE REALITY OF THESE KINDS OF SUMS PAID TO THEM\nAND I SHOULD POINT OUT MUCH OF THIS TOOK PLACE WHILE HILLARY\nCLINTON WAS SECRETARY OF STATE IN WHICH MANY OF THESE\nCOMPANIES, FOR INSTANCE, UBS HAD INTEREST BEFORE THE GOVERNMENT.\nUBS WAS BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.\nIT REQUIRED OVER -- HELPING ITS CUSTOMERS EVADE TAXES IN THE\nUNITED STATES. IT REQUIRED AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN\nTHE STATE DEPARTMENT AND THE SWISS GOVERNMENT IN ORDER FOR\nTHE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO GET SOME OF THOSE RECORDS.\nYOU KNOW, WHEN THEY TALK NOW ABOUT -- ALLEN TALKED ABOUT THE\nFUTURE, THIS WAS -- YOU KNOW, THESE WERE ISSUES WHILE SHE WAS\nSECRETARY OF STATE. >> OKAY.\nI WANT TO GET DOUGLAS IN. DOUGLAS, HOW MUCH DAMAGE DO\nTHESE HACKED MEMOS DO TO THE CLINTONS?\nTHEY SEEM TO REINFORCE MANY OF THE CONCERNS VOTERS HAVE ABOUT\nTHEM. >> IT DOES SOME DAMAGE BUT IT\nSEEMS LIKE A DOCUMENT DUMP, AN ILLEGAL ONE, MEANING WIKILEAKS,\nABOUT PEOPLE DUMPING THIS AND HACKING.\nI THINK THE WIKILEAKS OR RUSSIA THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE A\nBIG OCTOBER SURPRISE BUT WITH NO SMOKING GUN, IT -- IT HAS A\nTAINT. IT PUTS A PAINT ON THE CLINTONS,\nBUT THINGS ARE RUNNING FAST. WE'VE GOT 11 DAYS.\nTHE NEWS CYCLE'S MOVING AND THIS LITTLE -- THESE INTERNAL E-MAILS\nJUST AREN'T HAVING THE WALLOP THAT I THINK THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN\nWOULD HAVE HOPED. IT DOESN'T HELP A LOT OF VOTERS\nHAVE BEEN HEARING ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S E-MAILS AND SERVERS\nAND WIKILEAKS FOR A YEAR NOW, AND THEY'RE TIRED OF IT SO I\nDON'T THINK ANY ONE OF THESE IS REALLY THAT DAMNING, BUT I AGREE\nWITH WHAT ALLEN SAID, KEY POINT, DON, I THINK BILL AND HILLARY\nCLINTON, IF SHE'S ELECTED PRESIDENT, HAVE TO DISTANCE\nTHEMSELVES FROM THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, TURN IT OVER TO NEW\nMANAGEMENT, ONLY SEND MAYBE A HOLIDAY GREETING CARD AND THAT'S\nABOUT IT BECAUSE THIS IS -- THIS IS A CREEPING PROBLEM IF THEY\nCONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEIR OWN FOUNDATION WHEN THEY'RE IN THE\nWHITE HOUSE. >> WE HAVE LOTS MORE TO DISCUSS.\nGENTLEMEN DON'T GO ANYWHERE. UP NEXT IS HILLARY CLINTON IS\nELECTED WILL HER HONEYMOON WITH CONGRESS BE OVER BEFORE IT\nBEGINS?",

HERE TO DISCUSS IS ALAN\nDERSHOWITZ, AND A GUY FOR UNAROUSED VOTERS.\nMICHAEL ISAKOFF, AND DOUGLAS BLINKLY, THE AUTHOR OF RIGHTFUL\nHERITAGE. GOOD EVENING.\nMR. DERSHOWITZ, I'LL START WITH YOU.\nHILLARY CLINTON NEVER MENTIONED THIS CLINTON INC. MEMO.\nDID THE CLINTONS DO ANYTHING ILLEGAL IN WHAT WE JUST SAW?\n>> NO, THEY'VE DONE NOTHING ILLEGAL.\nTHERE'S NO EVIDENCE SHE MADE ANY SINGLE DECISION AS SECRETARY OF\nSTATE BASED ON CONTRIBUTIONS, BUT I THINK THEY HAVE TO LOOK TO\nTHE FUTURE. IF I WERE HILLARY CLINTON I\nWOULD SAY, IF ELECTED PRESIDENT MY HUSBAND WILL NOT ACCEPT A\nSINGLE PENNY FOR SPEAKING FEES DURING THE FOUR OR EIGHT YEARS\nI'M PRESIDENT. THE CLINTON FOUNDATION WILL BE\nPUT IN THE HANDS OF VERY OBJECTIVE, WORLD-CLASS, NOBEL\nPRIZE WINNING WHATEVER, AND WE WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.\nI THINK IF SHE SAYS ANYTHING, SHE SHOULD LOOK TO THE FUTURE\nAND ASSURE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC WHATEVER HAPPENED IN THE PAST IS\nNO PROBLEM IN THE FUTURE. >> SHE NEEDS TO TALK, NOT BE\nQUIET ON THE ISSUE? >> I THINK SHE SHOULD TALK ABOUT\nONLY ABOUT THE FUTURE. >> OF COURSE, DONALD TRUMP IS\nUSING IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY, AS HE SHOULD, RIGHT, AS HER\nOPPONENT? >> OF COURSE.\n>> HE WAS QUICK TO PILE ON TODAY.\nLOOK AT THIS. >> JUST TODAY WE READ ABOUT\nCLINTON CONFIDANTE DOUG BRAND BRAGGING HE FUNNELED TENS OF\nMILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO BILL CLINTON INC. THROUGH THE\nFOUNDATION DONATIONS, PAID SPEECHES AND CONSULTING\nCONTRACTS. MR. BAND CALLED THE ARRANGEMENT\nUNORTHODOX. THE REST OF US CALL IT OUTRIGHT\nCORRUPT. IF THE CLINTONS WERE WILLING TO\nPLAY THIS FAST AND LOOSE WITH THEIR ENTERPRISE WHEN THEY\nWEREN'T IN THE WHITE HOUSE, JUST IMAGINE WHAT THEY'LL DO GIVEN\nTHE CHANCE TO ONCE AGAIN CONTROL THE OVAL OFFICE.\n>> OUTRIGHT CORRUPT, ALAN. IS THAT ACCURATE?\nARE THE PRACTICES CORRUPT? >> NO, I THINK THEY'RE UNSEEMLY\nAND I THINK THEY CREATE AN APPEARANCE THAT THE AMERICAN\nPUBLIC IS ENTITLED TO LOOK AT. BUT COMING FROM DONALD TRUMP,\nMAKING THESE ARGUMENTS? LOOK AT HIS HISTORY.\nIF HE WOULD BRING TO THE WHITE HOUSE THE WAY HE HAS CONDUCTED\nBUSINESS THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER, IT WOULD BE FAR, FAR WORSE THAN\nANYTHING HE ALLEGES. SO ONE ALWAYS HAS TO MAKE\nCOMPARATIVE JUDGMENTS. >> MICHAEL, SO THIS MEMO\nDESCRIBES HOW BILL CLINTON AIDE DOUG BRAND, YOU HEARD DONALD\nTRUMP MENTION DOUG BRAND THERE, HOW HE HELPED -- EXCUSE ME, DOUG\nBAND, HOW HE HELPED RUN CLINTON INC., PULLING IN LUCRATIVE DEALS\nIN WHAT HE CALLS, THIS IS A QUOTE, IN-KIND SERVICES FOR THE\nPRESIDENT AND HIS FAMILY FOR PERSONAL TRAVEL, HOSPITALITY,\nVACATION AND THE LIKE. IS THAT STANDARD PRACTICE,\nIN-KIND SERVICES? >> WHAT WAS GOING ON HERE WAS\nSUSTAINING A LIFESTYLE THAT BILL CLINTON HAD BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO\nOF FLYING AROUND THE WORLD, COLLECTING LARGE SUMS OF MONEY\nFOR TALKS AND SPEECHES, STAYING AT FIVE STAR HOTELS, AND, YEAH,\nIT IS UNSEEMLY. YOU KNOW, THE GAP BETWEEN THE\nRHETORIC THAT HILLARY CLINTON AND DEMOCRATS HAVE USED ABOUT\nTHE PROBLEM OF MONEY AND POLITICS, OF UNDUE INFLUENCE FOR\nSPECIAL INTERESTS AND WEALTHY DONORS, AND THEN THE REALITY OF\nSPECIAL INTERESTS AND WEALTHY DONORS POURING THIS KIND OF\nMONEY INTO THE FAMILY FOUNDATION, INTO THE POCKET OF\nTHE CLINTON FAMILY THROUGH THESE SUMS PAID TO BILL CLINTON IS --\nIS PRETTY LARGE. I THINK THAT'S -- YOU KNOW,\nTHAT'S WHERE THIS IS AN ISSUE AND IS A PROBLEM.\nIT HAS BEEN FOR THE CLINTONS FOR A LONG TIME.\nTHE GAP BETWEEN THE HIGH-MINDED RHETORIC THAT THEY ESPOUSE AND\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS CERTAINLY ESPOUSED AND THE REALITY OF\nTHESE KINDS OF SUMS PAID TO THEM.\nAND I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT MUCH OF THIS TOOK PLACE WHILE HILLARY\nCLINTON WAS SECRETARY OF STATE, IN WHICH MANY OF THESE\nCOMPANIES, FOR INSTANCE, UBS HAD INTERESTS BEFORE THE GOVERNMENT.\nUBS WAS BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.\nIT REQUIRED OVER -- HELPING ITS CUSTOMERS EVADE TAXES IN THE\nUNITED STATES. IT REQUIRES AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN\nTHE STATE DEPARTMENT AND THE SWISS GOVERNMENT IN ORDER FOR\nTHE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO GET SOME OF THOSE RECORDS.\nYOU KNOW, WHEN THEY TALK NOW ABOUT -- YOU KNOW, AND ALAN\nTALKED ABOUT THE FUTURE. THIS WAS -- YOU KNOW, THESE WERE\nISSUES WHILE SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE.\n>> OKAY. I WANT TO GET DOUGLAS IN.\nDOUGLAS, HOW MUCH DAMAGE DO THESE HACKED MEMOS DO TO THE\nCLINTONS? THEY SEEM TO REINFORCE MANY OF\nTHE CONCERNS VOTERS HAVE ABOUT THEM.\n>> WELL, IT DOES SOME DAMAGE, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE A DOCUMENT\nDUMP, AN ILLEGAL ONE -- MEANING WIKILEAKS -- ABOUT PEOPLE\nHACKING THIS AND DUMPING IT RIGHT BEFORE THE ELECTION, I\nTHINK THE WIKILEAKS PEOPLE ARE RUSSIA, THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AN\nOCTOBER SURPRISE, BUT WITH NO SMOKING GUN IT HAS A TAINT.\nIT PUTS A TAINT ON THE CLINTONS, BUT THINGS ARE RUNNING FAST.\nWE HAVE 11 DAYS. THE NEWS CYCLE IS MOVING, AND\nTHIS LITTLE -- THESE INTERNAL E-MAILS JUST AREN'T HAVING THE\nWALLOP I THINK THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WOULD HAVE HOPED.\nIT DOESN'T HELP A ALL RIGHT OF VOTERS HAVE BEEN HEARING ABOUT\nHILARY CLINTON'S E-MAILS AND SERVERS AND WIKILEAKS FOR A YEAR\nNOW AND THEY'RE TIRED OF IT. I DON'T THINK ANY ONE OF THESE\nIS REALLY THAT DAMNING. BU I AGREE WITH WHAT ALAN SAID,\nKEY POINT, DON. I THINK BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON\nIF SHE IS ELECTED PRESIDENT HAVE TO DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION. MAYBE ONLY SEND A HOLIDAY\nGREETING CARD AND THAT'S ABOUT IT BECAUSE THIS IS A CREEPING\nPROBLEM IF THEY CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEIR OWN FOUNDATION WHEN\nTHEY'RE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. >> WE HAVE LOTS MORE TO DISCUSS.\nGENTLEMEN, DON'T GO ANYWHERE. UP NEXT, IF HILLARY CLINTON IS\nELECTED WILL HER HONEYMOON WITH CONGRESS BE OVER BEFORE IT\nBEGINS? \u00e2\u0099\u00aa",

YOU HAVE THE PRESIDENT, THE\nFORMER PRESIDENT AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL MEETING ON A\nECRET THE SAME WEEK THEY'RE GOING TO INTERROGATE\nHILLARY. THIS IS THE KIND OF STUFF THAT\nIN A PLACE LIKE VENEZUELA YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THEY\nDON'T HAVE THE RULE OF LAW. BUT WHAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT\nNOW -- AND WIKILEAKS IN A SENSE IS RIPPING THE SCAR OFF OF THE\nLARGEST AMOUNT OF CORRUPTION IN AMERICAN HISTORY.\nTHIS BEATS ANY PRIOR CORRUPTION SCANDAL I KNOW OF INCLUDING THE\n1868 PERIOD WHERE GRANT WAS PRESIDENT, INCLUDING THE HARDING\nADMINISTRATION. I MEAN, INCLUDING SOME OF THE\nTHINGS THAT HAPPENED UNDER TRUMAN.\nNONE OF THOSE THINGS ARE LIKE THIS.\nTHIS IS THE LARGEST SCANDAL AFFECTING A SENIOR AMERICAN\nPOLITICIAN I THINK IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES AND\nIT'S AS YOU YOURSELF JUST POINTED OUT, YOU HAVE HILLARY\nCLINTON CLEARLY TRADING ON THE OFFICE OF SECRETARY OF STATE IN\nA WAY WHICH HAS TO BE -- I'M NOT A LAWYER, BUT MY GUESS IS YOU'VE\nGOT PROBABLY 60 OR 70 COUNTS AGAINST HER JUST IN TERMS OF\nSCHEDULING PEOPLE TO COME IN TO HER OFFICE.\n>> AND YET SHE COULD BE ELECTED AS PRESIDENT.\nAND YET ACCORDING TO POLLS SHE'S IN THE THIS RACE.\nIN 12 DAYS SHE WOULD POSSIBLY WIN THE ELECTION.\nWHAT DOES THAT SAY. >> OUR COUNTRY IS A CULL OR F\nCRISIS.

CLINTON. NOT ONLY DID HE BRING IN\nMILLIONS TO THE FOUNDATION, I SET UP MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN\nSPEAKING FEES FOR BILL CLINTON, AND A HEFTY INCOME FOR HIMSELF.\nCONSULTING WITH FOLKS WHO DONATED MONEY TO THE FOUNDATION.\nIT'S A TANGLED WEB, IF YOU GET THE PICTURE.\nMONEY WENT TO CHARITY, MONEY WENT TO BILL CLINTON.\nMONEY WENT TO THE BAND. AND STUDYING TAX RETURNS FROM\nTHE CLINTON FOUNDATION, ACCORDING TO THIS DOCUMENT,\nMILLIONS WERE SPENT ON NONCHARITABLE EXPENSES.\nIN 2014, THE CLINTON FOUNDATION RECEIVED $338 MILLION IN\nREVENUE. WOW.\n64% OF THAT MONEY WENT FOR CHARIT\nTHE REST WAS SAVED, SPENDS ON ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, OR\nINVESTED.

I WOULD ADD THE CRITICAL\nINGREDIENT IS THE FACT THEY HAD POLITICAL POWER AT THIS TIME.\nTHIS WAS A REVIEW DONE BY SIMPSON AT THE REQUEST OF\nCHELSEA CLINTON OF THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nONE OF THE THINGS IT FOUND IS THAT DONORS HAD QUOTED\nEXPECTATION OF A QUID PRO QUO FOR GIFTS, END QUOTE.\nI THINK IT'S RELATED TO INFLUENCE PEDDLING AND THE FACT\nTHAT THESE DONORS WERE EXPECTING FAVORABLE ACTION FROM HILLARY\nCLINTON. >> I HAVE STUDIED THIS AND SO\nHAS MY STAFF, AND THEY'RE THE BEST IN THE BUSINESS.\nWE CAN'T FIND MANY QUOTES, PARTICULARLY FROM THE YEAR 2014,\n15, YOU KNOW?

WHAT IS IN IT FOR THEM?\nWHY DO THEY HAVE TO GIVE HIM $250,000?\n>> YOU'RE PUTTING MONEY IN MULTIPLE POCKETS.\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS NO FORMAL POWER BUT SHE'S WIDELY EXPECTED\nTO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ASSUME SHE\nMAY BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT. SO YOU CAN ARGUE IT'S A DOWN\nPAYMENT FOR SERVICES EXPECTED TO RECEIVE.\n>> NOW, ONE OF THE CRITICISMS OF YOU, AND YOUR BOOK IS WORTH\nPRINTING, YOU'RE ASSOCIATED WITH THE CEO OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.\nYOU WORK FOR GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY INSTITUTE.\nSO PEOPLE MIGHT SAY WELL, YOU KNOW, HE'S GOT A BEEF AND HOW\nWOULD YOU ANSWER THAT? >> WELL, WHAT I WOULD SAY IS\nTHAT WE STARTED RESEARCHING THE CLINTONS IN 2013.\nWE FORMED GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABLE INSTITUTE BEFORE THAT.\nWE WENT AFTER CORRECTIONAL INSIDER TRAINING, LEADERSHIP\nPACKS SO WE GO AFTER ALL FORMS OF CORRUPTION.\nI JUST ARGUE CLINTONS ARE THE ALFAS AS FAR AS SELF ENRICHMENT\nAND WE STARTED THIS BEFORE DONALD TRUMP WAS A CANDIDATE.\n>> RIGHT. RIGHT.\n>> AND YOU HAVE FRIENDS WHO, I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT.\nLAST QUESTION. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION IS CORRUPT? >> I DO.\nI DO. AND I THINK IT WARRANTS FEDERAL\nINVESTIGATION. I'M NOT A LAWYER.\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS INTERNAL REVIEW, LOOKING AT ABC NEWS\nREPORT FROM A COUPLE WEEKS AGO ABOUT HAITIAN CONTRACTS, GOING\nTO DONORS IF YOU'RE NOT A FRIEND OF BILL YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO\nCOMPETE FOR A CONTRACT. >> IF DONALD TRUMP IS ELECTED IT\nWILL GET INVESTIGATED. IF HILLARY CLINTON ELECTED.\nTHANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE APPRECIATE IT.\nPLENTY MORE IS AHEAD AS THE FACTOR MOVES ALONG THIS EVENING.\nPENTAGON SAYS SOLDIERS ORDERED TO PAY BACK BONUSES WILL NOT\nHAVE TO DO SO. THAT, AFTER THE FACTOR GOT\nINVOLVED.

ALSO, THERE IS NEW EVIDENCE\nBILL CLINTON USED HIS FOUNDATION TO FATTEN HIS\nWALLET. WE WILL HAVE REPORTS ON\nBOTH. AS WE HAVE NOTED OBAMACARE\nRATES ARE EXPECTED TO RISE BY DOUBLE DIGITS.\nTONIGHT WE TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE NUMBERS AND WHO\nWILL BE HARDEST HIT. AS OF THIS EVENING HILLARY\nCLINTON LEADS IN THE REAL CLEAR POLITICS AVERAGE BY\n5.8 POINTS IN THE FOUR WAY RACE AND 5.7 IN A TWO-WAY.\nBETS ODDS CONTINUE TO SHOW MRS. CLINTON A PROHIBITIVE\nFAVORITE BY NEARLY 5 TO 1. A GOOD POLL WITH A TRACK\nRECORD IN 2012 BUSINESS INVESTORS DAILY POLL STILL\nSHOWS A TIGHT RACE. HILLARY CLINTON IS UP BY 2\nIN POET A TWO AND FOUR-WAY RACE AND FOR THAT AND OTHER\nRECENT POLLING FOX DECISION TEAM CHRIS ANDERSON PART OF\nA BOSTON CONSULTING FIRM THAT BEARS HIS NAME.\nHELLO, CHRIS. >> HI, BRIT.\n>> WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT TONIGHT?\nYOU SEE A LOT OF POLLS. WHAT INTERESTS YOU TONIGHT?\n>> WELL, THERE ARE THREE POLLS OUT THAT ARE\nINTERESTING FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THEY ARE\nSTATES THAT TRUMP HAS TARGETED AND WOULD PROBABLY\nNEED TO PICK UP AT LEAST A COUPLE OF THEM TO WIN THE\nPRESIDENCY. OBAMA WON WITH 332 VOTES, OF\nCOURSE, IN 2012. TRUMP WOULD NOT ONLY NEED TO\nHOLD ALL OF THE STATES MITT ROMNEY WON BUT HE WOULD NEED\nTO PICK OFF 63 ELECTORAL VOTES FROM STATES THAT OBAMA\nWON. WE WERE LOOKING AT RECENT\nPOLLS IN NEVADA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE AND PENNSYLVANIA,\nWHICH HAVE BEEN TALKED ABOUT AS POTENTIAL TARGETS IN THAT\nREGARD. >> HE HAS BEEN CAMPAIGNING\nIN ALL THOSE PLACES. WHAT ARE YOU SEEING RIGHT\nNOW IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, WHICH IS HE HAD BEEN DOWN THERE.\nHAS THAT BEGUN TO LOOK A LITTLE BETTER FOR HIM?\nWHAT ARE YOU SEEING? >> WHAT WE'RE SEEING ACROSS\nALL THE STATES AND NATIONALLY, THE REAL HARD\nCEILING FOR TRUMP IT LOOKS LIKE, IT'S RARE THAT YOU SEE\nA POLL THAT HAS HIM ABOVE 44%.\nMEANWHILE, IT'S VERY RARE THAT YOU SEE A POLL THAT HAS\nCLINTON BELOW 44%. SO THERE -- IT STARTED TO\nLOOK LIKE TRUMP'S CEILING IS RIGHT AROUND WHERE CLINTON'S\nFLOOR IS, WHICH IS REALLY DIFFICULT TO OVERCOME.\nIN NEW HAMPSHIRE, SPECIFICALLY, WE'RE SEEING\nTHERE IS A POLL OUT FROM MOP MOUTH THAT HAS IT A\nFOUR-POINT RACE, WHICH YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE WILL SAY\nTHAT'S PRETTY CLOSE. HE COULD OVERCOME THAT.\nBUT, WHEN YOU LOOK UNDERNEATH THE HOOD AND\nALMOST ALL THESE STATES, YOU HAVE A REAL SMALL NUMBER OF\nUNDECIDES. HE WOULD NEED TO PRETTY MUCH\nWIN THEM ACROSS THE BOARD TO CATCH HER.\nAND HE WOULD NEED TO SHAKE LOOSE SOME OF THE THIRD\nPARTY SUPPORT AND GET THEM TO COME HIS WAY.\nHOWEVER, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THOSE VOTERS, ON THEIR OWN,\nTHIRD PARTY SUPPORTERS UNDECIDED VOTERS, THEY ARE\nEVEN MORE UNFAVORABLE TOWARDS TRUMP THAN VOTERS\nOVERALL. THEY DON'T THINK HE HAS THE\nJUDGMENT, TEMPERAMENT, OR THE QUALIFICATIONS TO BE\nPRESIDENT. >> SO THIS IS --\n>> -- THEY DO THINK HILLARY CLINTON DOES.\n>> SO YOU LOOK IN THOSE SITUATIONS, IT LOOKS\nPOSSIBLE, AT LEAST ON PAPER BUT DIFFICULT ON THE GROUND.\nIS THAT A FAIR WAY TO SUM IT UP?\n>> EXACTLY. YOU KNOW, WE'RE 10 DAYS OUT\nRIGHT NOW. 2, 3, 4 POINTS ON A POLL\nSOUNDS LIKE IT COULD BE OVERCOME, BUT THAT IS A\nREALLY HERCULEAN AMOUNT OF VOTE TO MAKE UP AT THIS\nPOINT IN THE RACE. >> WHAT HAPPENED NEVADA?\nNEVADA HAS BEEN THE STATE THAT HE HAS LOOKED LIKE HE\nMIGHT DO OKAY THERE THAT LOOKS PRETTY CLOSE RIGHT\nNOW, CORRECT? >> IT DOES.\nIT DOES. THERE WAS A POLL OUT TODAY\nTHAT HAD THE RACE, I THINK IT HAD THE RACE TIED,\nACTUALLY. SAME DYNAMIC, LOW, LOW\nCEILING FOR BOTH CANDIDATES THERE.\nONE THING THAT WHEN ELECTION DAY GETS HERE IS REALLY\nGOING TO FAVOR THE CLINTON CAMP IS THAT HER VOTE IN\nNEVADA IS CONCENTRATED IN MORE URBAN SUBURBAN AREAS,\nLAS VEGAS, RENO WHERE TRUMP'S VOTE IS OUT IN RURAL\nAREAS. SO WHEN IT COMES TO GETTING\nOUT THE VOTE, IT'S OBVIOUSLY A LOT EASIER TO DO WHEN YOU\nARE WALKING AROUND NEIGHBORHOODS AND WHEN YOU\nHAPPEN TO BE DRIVING AROUND, YOU KNOW, THE PLAINS.\n>> RIGHT. TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT\nPENNSYLVANIA. OBVIOUSLY, THAT'S A BIG --\nIT'S A BIG PRIZE. IT'S ONE WHERE HE HAS\nCAMPAIGNED HARD. IT'S BROKEN REPUBLICAN\nHEARTS IN MANY A PREVIOUS CYCLE.\nHE WOULD NEED ONE OF THOSE BIG STATES TO WIN.\n>> YEAH. >> IS THAT ONE WHERE HE HAS\nA REAL CHANCE OR WHAT DO YOU THINK?\n>> YOU KNOW, IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE IT.\nTHE MARGIN THERE FOR HIM IS -- POLL OUT TODAY OR\nYESTERDAY HAD CLINTON UP 7 THERE.\nTRUMP IS UNDER 80% AMONG REPUBLICANS IN PENNSYLVANIA.\nAND HE IS LOSING INDEPENDENTS.\nHE IS NOT GOING TO WIN ANYWHERE UNLESS HE\nCONSOLIDATES THE BASE SUPPORT AND WINS\nINDEPENDENTS RIGHT NOW HE IS NOT DOING THAT.\n>> WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?\nBECAUSE WE KNOW MITT ROMNEY GOT 93% OF THE REPUBLICAN\nVOTE IN 2012. DOES IT LOOK TO YOU AS IF\nTHESE VOTERS, THESE REPUBLICAN VOTERS WILL COME\nHOME TO HIM IN TIME OR COULD THEY -- DOES IT LOOK TO YOU\nLIKE THEY ARE RESISTANT TO HIM NO MATTER WHAT.\n>> I THINK THAT THERE IS A PORTION OF THEM THAT ARE\nRESISTANT TO HIM NO MATTER WHAT.\nAND, YOU KNOW, WE SEE THAT IN THE POLLING, AND I THINK\nTHAT A LOT OF US JUST TALKING TO OUR FRIENDS AND\nCOLLEAGUES HAVE SEEN THAT, TOO.\n>> WELL, I GUESS WHAT ANY TRUMP SUPPORTER WOULD TELL\nYOU IS THAT THIS HAS BEEN AN ELECTION YEAR LIKE NO OTHER.\nAND AUGUST KINDS OF THINGS HAVE HAPPENED AND WE HAVE\nALL, MYSELF INCLUDED, BEEN WRONG BEFORE.\nSO I GUESS THAT GIVES THEM SOMETHING TO HOPE FOR.\n>> YEAH. AND I WOULDN'T DISAGREE WITH\nTHEM AT ALL THAT THIS HAS BEEN A WEIRD CYCLE.\nSO WE WILL SEE 10 DAYS FROM NOW.\n>> WE WILL BE THERE ON ELECTION NIGHT.\nCHRIS, THANKS VERY MUCH FOR DOING.\nTHIS NICE TO SEE YOU. TODAY'S WIKILEAKS EMAIL DUMP\nRAISES SERIOUS QUESTIONS FORMERT BILL CLINTON AND HIS AIDS\nGENERATED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR BOTH THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION AND THE CLINTON FAMILY.\nPERSONALLY. FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL\nCORRESPONDENT ED HENRY HAS THE STORY.\n>> WHILE THE SHEAR NUMBER OF WIKILEAKS EMAILS HAS MADE IT\nHARD FOR ALLEGATIONS OF PAY-TO-PLAY AT THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION TO BREAK THROUGH WITH VOTERS --\n>> -- THE MORE EMAILS WIKILEAKS RELEASES, THE MORE\nLINES BETWEEN THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, THE SECRETARY OF\nSTATE'S OFFICE AND THE CLINTONS' PERSONAL FINANCES\nTHEY ALL GET BLURRED. >> TONIGHT, THERE ARE FRESH\nSIGNS REPUBLICANS MAY HAVE HIT PAYDIRT, LITERALLY, WITH\nA DAMAGING EMAIL ABOUT FORMER PRESIDENT BILL\nCLINTON LINING HIS BOX COLD, HARD CASH.\n>> JUST TODAY WE READ ABOUT CLINTON CONFIDENT DOUG\nBRAND, BRAGGING THAT HE HAD FUNNELED TENS OF MILLIONS OF\nDOLLARS TO BILL CLINTON INC. THROUGH THE FOUNDATION\nDONATIONS, PAID SPEECHES, AND CONSULTING CONTRACTS.\n>> DONALD TRUMP IS REFERRING TO THIS LONG MEMO WHICH\nDETAILS THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION AND THEIR MONEY-MAKING OPERATION.\nSIP NICLY DUBBED BILL CLINTON INC. NOT BUT DONALD\nTRUMP YOU BUT BY FORMER CLINTON CONFIDANTE DOUG\nBAND. HE ALLEGED THAT THE FORMER\nPRESIDENT WAS CASHING. IN HE CHARGED THERE WAS A\nSTRATEGY TO STEER DONORS FOR THE CLINTON FOUNDATION TO\nHIRE CLINTON FOR SPEECHES AND CONSULTING CONTRACTS.\nA 2011 MEMO REVEALING THE PLAN, QUOTE, YIELDED MORE\nTHAN $30 MILLION FOR HIM PERSONALLY WITH 66 MILLION\nTO BE PAID OUT LATER. THE EXCLUSIVE NEW EMAIL\nPERHAPS SHEDDING LIGHT ON WHY HILLARY CLINTON PIVOTED\nTO THE GOOD WORK THE FOUNDATION DOES AROUND THE\nWORLD WHEN PRESSED AT THE THIRD AND FINAL PRESIDENTIAL\nDEBATE. >> WHY ISN'T IT WHAT\nMR. TRUMP CALLS PAY-TO-PLAY? >> WELL, EVERYTHING I DID AS\nSECRETARY OF STATE WAS IN FURTHERANCE OF OUR COUNTRY'S\nINTERESTS AND OUR VALUES. >> BAND WROTE THE MEMO AFTER\nCHELSEA CLINTON BLEW THE WHISTLE ON ALLEGATIONS THAT\nHIS CONSULTING COMPANY WAS MAKING MONEY OFF OF ACCESS\nTO HER FATHER. BAND'S DEFENSE?\nBILL CLINTON DID IT TOO. ALLEGING IN ANOTHER EMAIL\nFROM A PREVIOUS WIKILEAKS DUMP THE FOUNDATION\nLITERALLY HAD ABOUT 500 CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.\nSUCH AS A TOP OFFICIAL OWNING A LARGE AMOUNT OF\nSTOCK IN GOLDMAN SAK'S, WHICH IS A MAJOR SPANS SORE\nOF THE CLINTON GLOBAL INITIATIVE.\n>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> BAND FURTHER ALLEGED THE\nFORMER PRESIDENT WAS COLLECTING MONEY FROM AT\nLEAST THREE SPONSORS OF CGI AND HAD ACCEPTED LARGE\nPERSONAL GIFTS AS WELL. THE CLINTON CAMP IS STILL\nREFUSING TO EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE\nWIKILEAKS EMAILS BUT BAND'S COMPANY IS CONFIRMING\nTONIGHT THAT HE WROTE THAT MEMO AND IT'S ACCURATE.\nAND THEY'RE INSISTING THE COMPANY NEVER RECEIVED ANY\nFINANCIAL BENEFIT FROM WORKING WITH THE CHARITY.\n>> ED, THANK YOU. THOSE WIKILEAKS DISCLOSURES\nHAVE BROUGHT INTO FOCUS ONCE MORE THE FACT THAT THE\nCLINTONS PAYMENT VERY RICH IN A VERY SHORT TIME.\nFOR MORE ON THIS WE TURN TO OUR NIGHTLY POLITICAL PANEL,\nNINA EASTON JOURNALIST AT \"FORTUNE MAGAZINE,\" MOLLY\nHEMINGWAY SENIOR EDITOR AT THE FEDERALIST.\nMOLLY, YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THIS.\nTHIS GET THIS OUT IN THE OPEN AND ON THE TABLE AGAIN\nAT A KEY MOMENT IN THE CAMPAIGN.\n>> THIS MEMO MAKES EXPLICIT WHAT WE HAVE KNOWN FOR A\nLONG TIME IS THAT THE CLINTONS HAVE LEVERAGED\nTHEIR FOUNDATION FOR PERSONAL PROFIT AND THAT THE\nFOUNDATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN SORT OF WINDOW CRESSING THAT\nHELPS EXPLAIN WHY WEALTHY PEOPLE BOTH FOREIGN AND\nDOMESTIC IN THE CLINTON ORBIT IT WOULD SEEM UNSEEMLY\nTO HAVE A PRESIDENT OR EXPRESIDENT LOBBIYING ON\nYOUR BEHALF. DOM TOGETHER ON A MISS\nPROMPT AND EMPLOY DOUG BAND TO RESOLVE SOME DISPUTE WITH\nYOUR CHEMICAL COMPANY IN KUWAIT AND NEED A FRIEND IN\nTHE STATE DEPARTMENT. THAT'S CINERGY AND MEANS\nEVERYONE IS WORKING WELL TOGETHER.\nTHIS MAKES IT MORE EXPLICIT. >> WHAT HAPPENS WAS SOME OF\nTHESE PEOPLE WHO GIVE TO THE FOUNDATION OR ENCOURAGE HAVE\nBILL CLINTON MAKE A SPEECH FOR SOME STAGGERING FEE AND\nBEFORE YOU KNOW IT THE CLINTONS ARE RACKING UP\nQUITE A SIGNIFICANT FORTUNE AND NOT A VERY BIG PERIOD OF\nTIME. >> IN THE SHORT TIME.\nHAD THE CLINTON MIND SET THAT I THINK BILL WOULD USE\nHIS POWER AND INFLUENCE AS A WAY TO RAISE A LOT OF MONEY\nFOR THIS FOUNDATION. IT DOESN'T JUST DOOP LITTLE\nTHINGS IT HELPS EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS IN HAITI.\nIT HELPS FARMERS IN AFRICA. HELPS ON THE H.I.V. AIDS\nFRONT. THAT WAS THE MIND SET.\n>> IT'S A REAL FOUNDATION, WE GET THAT.\n>> WHAT THESE MEMOS SHOW IS THAT THERE WAS A PERSONAL\nGAIN OF IN THE ORDER OF TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO\nBILL CLINTON. THE OTHER THING IT SHOWS AND\nKIND EMBELLISHES ON IS THESE OCTOPUS TYPE RELATIONSHIPS\nYOU THAT REFERRED TO, MOLLY. AND DOUG BAND AT THE CENTER\nOF THIS. THE ONE BY THE WAY WHO COMES\nOUT THE BEST IN ALL OF THESE IS CHELSEA CLINTON.\n>> HOW SO? >> WELL, SHE ACCUSED DOUG\nBAND OF TRYING TO PROFIT OFF OF THE FOUNDATION AND TRIES\nTO HER FATHER. AND SHE DID SO -- AND SHE\nWANTED MORE CORPORATE GOVERNOR MAN'S RULES AROUND\nTHE FOUNDATION AND HE CALLED HER AND RETURNED A SPOILED\nBRAT. >> THAT MAY BE SO BUT THE\nONE THING -- SHE DIDN'T CALL HER FATHER AND HER MOTHER ON\nTHE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY WERE PROFITING FROM THE\nFOUNDATION? >> RIGHT.\n>> DOUG BAND, WU KNOW, HE GET CALLED ON THAT AT LEAST\nHE WROTE A MEMO BLOWING A WHISTLE ON SOME OF THIS.\nCHELSEA GETS CREDIT, PERHAPS, FOR CALLING HIM\nOUT. BUT NOBODY CALLED OUT MOM\nAND DAD. >> NO, THEY DIDN'T.\nBUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S CLEAR THAT DOUG BAND AND CHELSEA\nCLINTON ARE REAL LOGGERHEADS AND SHE SAW DOUG BAND AS\nBUILDING HIS CONSULTING FIRM AND GETTING WEALTHY BASED ON\nRUNNING THE FOUNDATION AND TIES.\n>> BECAUSE SHE WAS SUGGESTING THAT MONEY\nSHOULDN'T HAVE GONE TO DOUG BAND BUT TO MOM AND POP.\nMOLLY? >> WHAT'S CEEFL IS THEY\nDON'T HAVE TO DENY GUILT AS FAR AS MUDDYING THE WATERS.\nTHE CLINTONS ARE EXPERTS AT MUDDYING THE WATERS.\nEVERYTHING LOOKS VERY COMPLICATED.\nYOU CAN HAVE SOME LEGITIMACY FOR WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND\nKEEPS THEM HELD ACCOUNTABLE. THIS IS GOING TO BE ONGOING\nISSUE. THIS IS AN ISSUE PEOPLE\nSHOULD KEEP ON LOOKING AT. >> THE CLINTON FOUNDATION\nISN'T GOING TO GO AWAY WHEN BILL BECOMES, IF HE DOES,\nFIRST LADDIE AS HE FIRST DESCRIBED IT AND PRESUMABLY\nHIS SPEECH-MAKING MAY CONTINUE.\n>> AND THE EMAILS ARE GOING TO KEEP COMING OUT AND THERE\nIS GOING TO BE INVESTIGATIONS IN CONGRESS.\nBATTLED INSTRUM MEANT. >> MILL STONE IF ELECTED.\n>> THAT'S WHY THERE WAS SO MUCH PRESSURE AROUND",

BAND CALLED THE ARRANGEMENT UNORTHODOX.\nTHE REST OF US CALL IT OUTRIGHT CORRUPT.\n>> THAT WAS DONALD TRUMP TODAY HITTING CLINTON FOR A MEMO\nUNCOVERED BY A WIKILEAKS HACKED E-MAILS.\nHE SAID FOR WHAT IT WAS WORTH IT WAS IN THE PREPARED REMARKS.\nTHIS NEWS HAS CREATED A SLEW OF ROUGH HEADLINES FOR THE\nCLINTONS, REINFORCING THE WORST PERCEPTIONS THAT SOME HAVE ABOUT\nTHEM, WRITTEN BY LONG-TIME AIDE DOUG BAND.\nTHIS MEMO DETAILS, ACCORDING TO DOUG BAND, WHAT THE STRATEGY WAS\nFOR LINING UP MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN CONSULTING CONTRACTS\nAND PAID SPEECHES FOR BILL CLINTON TO THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION. AND IT ALSO MAKES CLEAR JUST HOW\nINSEPARABLE THE CLINTON FOUNDATION WAS TO THE FAMILY'S\nOWN PERSONAL BUSINESS INTERESTS. THE NEWS HAS NOT AUTHENTICATED\nTHE E-MAILS, THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HASN'T, EITHER, BUT\nBAND DID AUTHENTICATE THE E-MAILS.\nIN THE NEWS THIS WEEK THAT OBAMACARE PREMIUMS ARE SET TO\nRISE SIGNIFICANTLY NEXT YEAR. WE COULD LOOK BACK AND SAY THIS\nWAS THE WEEK THAT DEMOCRATS LOST THEIR SHOT AT A CLEAN SWEEP DOWN\nTHE BALLOT. PERHAPS IT'S TOO LATE TO HAVE\nTHIS STUFF IMPACT THE PRESIDENTIAL, BUT DOWN THE\nBALLOT IN ANOTHER STORY. IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME THE\nCLINTONS FOUND THEMSELVES IN THIS POSITION.\nLOOK AT THIS SAME WEEK 20 YEARS AGO.\nBILL CLINTON WAS LEADING BOB DOLE BY AS MUCH AS 20 POINTS IN\nSOME OF THE POLLS. THE DEMOCRATS WERE LOOKING AT\nNOT JUST KEEPING THE WHITE HOUSE, THEY WANTED CONTROL OF\nBOTH THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE, AND IN EARLY OCTOBER, THEY\nTHOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO DO IT.\nTHEN CAME WHAT SOME CALLED CHINAGATE.\nIT WAS AN INVESTIGATION THAT FOCUSED ON WHETHER ILLEGAL\nCHINESE DONATIONS WERE BEING FUNNELLED IN TO THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.\nCLINTON STILL WON REELECTION. A LOT OF STRATEGISTS BELIEVE IT\nWAS THOSE BAD OCTOBER HEADLINES THAT GOT REPUBLICANS WHO WERE\nDEMORALIZED ABOUT DOLE BACK ON BOARD TO VOTE REPUBLICAN DOWN\nTHE BALLOT. CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF IS A\nHILLARY CLINTON SUPPORTER. HE'S BACK WITH ME NOW. WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW.\n>> THANK YOU. GOOD TO BE HERE.\n>> DO YOU THINK SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE POLITICAL DISTRACTION IT\nCOULD BE THAT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION IN SOME FORM EITHER\nHAS TO BE SHUT DOWN OR CHANGED? >> I THINK IT SHOULD PROBABLY BE\nDIVORCED FROM THE FAMILY, AND -- >> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?\n>> I THINK THE FOUNDATION HAS DONE TREMENDOUS WORK AND\nCONTINUES TO DO TREMENDOUS WORK, AND I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO\nWANT TO KEEP THAT LEGACY ALIVE, BUT I THINK THE FAMILY ITSELF\nSHOULD SEPARATE FROM IT SO THAT THERE'S A CLEAN BREAK WITH THE\nWHITE HOUSE. I THINK THAT WOULD BE IN THE\nBEST INTERESTS OF THE NEW PRESIDENT, AND THAT'S WHAT I\nWOULD SUGGEST. I DO THINK, THOUGH, LOOKING AT\nTHE PICTURE OF THE CAMPAIGN RIGHT NOW, THESE NEW RUSSIAN\nHACKED DOCUMENTS, RUSSIAN LEAKED DOCUMENTS AREN'T LIKELY TO\nCHANGE THE DYNAMIC. I THINK POSSIBLY AT THE TOP OF\nTHE TICKET OR DOWN BALLOT. I THINK RAISING THE PREMIUMS IS\nMORE OF AN ISSUE FOR THE DOWN BALLOT CANDIDATES, AND I WOULD\nURGE THE DOWN BALLOT CANDIDATES THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE THEY HAVE\nTO DISCUSS AND ADDRESS. THAT, I THINK, IS PROBABLY THE\nBIGGER CHALLENGE THIS WEEK. >> LET ME ASK YOU, THOUGH, GOING\nBACK TO THE FOUNDATION. WHAT THIS MEMO SHOWED IS HOW\nPOTENTIALLY CORRUPTIBLE IT COULD BE IF YOU ALSO HAVE ACCESS TO\nTHE HIGHEST OFFICE IN THE LAND. PRESIDENT CLINTON WAS A PRIVATE\nCITIZEN AT THE TIME. IT IS A CONCERN WHAT THIS LOOKS\nLIKE IF SUDDENLY IT LOOKS LIKE CORPORATE DONORS CAN ESSENTIALLY\nBUY ACCESS TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nSO HOW DO YOU DIVORCE IT WITHOUT A TOTAL SHUTDOWN?\nDO YOU THINK THAT IS POSSIBLE? >> I DO THINK IT'S POSSIBLE.\nI THINK WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT THE FAMILY SHOULDN'T BE INVOLVED\nIN THE FOUNDATION AND THAT OTHERS WHO ARE HOLY AND\nINDEPENDENT OF THE PIRS FAMILY SHOULD RUN IT.\nI THINK THAT IS IMMINENTLY DOABLE.\n>> WE CAN'T DO ANY FUNDRAISERS OR PAID SPEECHES IF SHE'S\nPRESIDENT? >> I THINK WHAT IT MEANS, AND\nAGAIN, I'M IF NOT AN EXPERT IN THIS AREA.\nAS A PRACTICAL MATTER, YOU FOCUS ON THE JOB AT HAND WHICH IS\nBEING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nANYTHING THAT DETRACTS FROM THAT DISTRACTION IS JUST NOT WORTH\nDOING. THAT'S WHAT I SUGGEST.\n>> LET'S GO TO HEALTH CARE. IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE ADVICE\nFOR DEMOCRATS WHO DON'T KNOW HOW TO HANDLE THIS.\nYOU THINK IT'S A TOUGH ISSUE FOR DEMOCRATS.\n>> IT'S AN ISSUE I THINK THEY NEED TO ADDRESS, AND THERE MAY\nBE CHANGES IN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHICH WE HAVE BEEN\nTRYING TO MAKE. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A PARTY IN\nCONGRESS THAT BASICALLY SAYS REPEAL OR NO AND AREN'T WILLING\nTO WORK ON IT. THEY ARE AFRAID TO MAKE ANY\nIMPROVEMENTS BECAUSE THAT'S ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT IT'S GOING\nTO CONTINUE. I WOULD TALK ABOUT THAT AS A\nCANDIDATE, I WOULD TALK ABOUT HOW I'M TRYING TO MAKE CHANGES\nAND IMPROVEMENTS, DRIVE DOWN COST, INCREASE COMPETITION.\nI WOULDN'T SIMPLY BE A CHEERLEADER --\n>> LET ME STOP YOU HERE. GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE.\nWHAT IS A FIX, A SIMPLE BILL, THAT COULD BE PASSED THAT'S\nREALISTIC THAT WOULD INCREASE CHANGES?\n>> I THINK ONE IS A PUBLIC AUCTION THAT WOULD DRIVE DOWN\nCOSTS BECAUSE YOU WOULD -- >> WITH A DEMOCRAT CONTROLLED\nHOUSE AND SENATE, MIND YOU, AND COULDN'T GET IT.\n>>. EFFORTS AT INCREASING\nCOMPETITION WITHIN THE EXCHANGES, IDENTIFYING WHY ARE\nSOME OF THE PLANS DROPPING OUT OF THOSE EXCHANGES, BUT THE\nBOTTOM LINE IS WE WANT TO KEEP PROTECTIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH\nPREEXISTING CONDITIONS, WHICH MEANS THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO\nACQUIRE INSURANCE, HEALTHY OR SICK.\nAND WHAT REPUBLICANS HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO ANSWER IS, OKAY,\nTHEY HAVE CRITICISMS ABOUT THE PLAN, THEY HAVE NO PLAN OF THEIR\nOWN. THEY SAY THEY'RE GOING TO\nPROTECT BOEM PREEXISTING CONDITIONS, BUT THEY CAN'T\nREALLY MEAN IT. SO THESE ARE THINGS, I THINK,\nTHAT THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES NEED TO ADDRESS HEAD ON AND I\nTHINK THEY NEED TO LOOK AT THE OTHER PARTY THAT WON'T FIX THESE\nPROBLEMS. >> WHAT DO YOU THINK IF THERE'S\nA BIG WAVE? >> THIS IS THE KIND OF ELECTION\nTHERE MAY BE A BIG WAVE. IF VOTERS TURN OUT LIKE WE THINK\nTHEY WILL. IF DONALD TRUMP VOTERS TURN OUT\nLIKE THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO.\nAND THE CLINTON SUPPORTERS, IF THEY CAN'T BRING THEMSELVES TO\nVOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP AT ALL, THAT HAS THE MAKINGS OF A HUGE\nWAVE. WE WON'T KNOW UNTIL NOVEMBER 9,\nBUT WE COULD HAVE A CHANGE IN THE HOUSE WITH THAT KIND OF\nWAVE. >> THE WAY YOU GUYS COUNT IN\nCALIFORNIA, WE WON'T KNOW UNTIL NOVEMBER 11 IF IT'S CLOSE.\nYOU'VE GOT EXPERIENCE WITH THAT, TOO, I BELIEVE.\n>> FOR THE COUNTRY'S SAKE, NOBODY WANTS TO WAIT A MINUTE\nMORE THAN THEY HAVE TO IN THIS ELECTION.\n>> I THINK ON A PRESIDENTIAL LEVEL, AT THE HOUSE IT COULD\nTAKE A FEW DAYS.

              "text": "I'M JOINED NOW BY BETH FOUHY,\nALONG WITH HOWARD FINEMAN WITH THE \"HUFFINGTON POST\" AND AN\nMSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST. BETH, LET'S TRY TO FIGURE THIS\nOUT. IF WE SAY IT'S NOT ILLEGAL, BUT\nTHERE'S AN INTERESTING PACKAGING GOING ON.\nIF YOU WANT TOM HANKS, YOU HAVE TO TAKE THESE OTHER TWO PEOPLE.\nYOU WANT THE DIRECTOR, YOU'VE GOT TO -- IN THE CASE OF DOUG\nBAND, IT SEEMS LIKE IF YOU WANT TO GET INVOLVED WITH THE CLINTON\nGLOBAL INITIATIVE, OKAY, THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, CAN YOU GET\nSOME SPEECHES FOR THE FORMER PRESIDENT.\nBY THE WAY, CAN WE BORROW THE AIRPLANE?\nI DON'T KNOW HOW IT WORKS, BUT THIS IS HOW IT LOOKS IN THESE\nE-MAILS. >> BILL CLINTON AT THE TIME WAS\nTHIS INCREDIBLY POPULAR EX-PET. EVERYBODY WANTED HIM.\nWE ALL KNOW HOW CHARISMATIC HE IS.\nBUT APPARENTLY HE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT MANAGING MONEY OR MANAGING\nHIS OWN TIME. HE TRUSTED DOUG BAND TO DO THAT\nWORK FOR HIM. SO DOUG BAND, INGENIOUSLY, ONE\nMIGHT SAY, FIGURED OUT HOW TO MAKE HIMSELF RICH AND ENRICH THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION, ALL AT ONCE. >> SO WHEN PEOPLE WANT TO BE\nGRABBED FOR A GENERATION CONTRIBUTION, THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION, WHY SHOULD THEY BE GRABBED TO GIVE HIM A SPEECH,\nWHEN HE ASKED FOR A BIG CHUNK OF MONEY?\nWHY ARE THEY ALL OF A SUDDEN -- >> THEY PROBABLY WANTED HIM.\nTHAT'S THE CRAZY PART. >> SO YOU SEE NOTHING WRONG WITH\nTHIS? >> IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE\nSAYING -- >> LOOK, IT'S NOT FOR ME TO\nJUDGE. IT'S WHAT THE CLINTONS DO.\n>> IT IS FOR YOU TO JUDGE! >> THEY TEND TO RUN RIGHT UP TO\nTHE EDGE OF WHAT'S LEGAL AND THAT'S, THAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT\nTHEIR CRITICS HAVE WITH THEM. >> IF YOU SPEND YOUR LIFE\nHITTING THE CHALK LINE IN TENNIS, BRING THE CONTRIBUTORS\nBACK INTO THE WHITE HOUSE IN THE '90s.\nAT SOME POINT, YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK CROOKED TO SOMEBODY.\n>> BUT THIS IS IMPORTANT, CHRIS. HE IS NOT THE CANDIDATE.\nHILLARY CLINTON IS THE CANDIDATE.\n>> WELL, SHE -- >> THE LAST SORT OF DUSTUP\nAROUND THIS APPEARED WHEN SHE HAD VISITED --\n>> SO SHE'S CLEAN? I'M JUST ASKING?\nIS SHE CLEAN? >> AGAIN, NOT FOR ME TO JUDGE.\nAND IT IS FOR YOU TO JUDGE. >> SHE DID NOT MEET WITH PEOPLE\nFROM THE CLINTON FOUNDATION SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WERE DONORS.\nLIKE BILL GATES AND MELINDA GATES.\nTHESE ARE PEOPLE WHO LEGITIMATELY HAD BUSINESS BEFORE\nTHE SECRETARY OF STATE AND THEY WERE ALSO CONTRIBUTORS.\n>> SO HOW DO YOU READ, BEFORE I GO TO HOWARD, HOW DO YOU READ\nTHIS WHOLE THING? THIS DEBATE BETWEEN -- ON ONE\nSIDE, YOU'VE GOT JOHN PODESTA AND CHELSEA CLINTON CHALLENGING\nTHE WAY THINGS ARE BEING DONE AND ON THE OTHER SIDE DEFENDING\nTHEM. THAT SEEMS TO BE THE WAY IT'S\nGOING, BETH. >> WELL, YOU KNOW, CHELSEA\nCLINTON, YOU KNOW, LOOKS LIKE KIND OF THE HERO HERE.\nLOOKS LIKE THE PERSON WHO IS STEPPING IN THERE, MAKING SURE\nHER FATHER'S NAME ISN'T BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY SOMEBODY\nWHO MEANS WELL, BUT -- >> SHE SAYS HE WAS HUSTLING.\n>> SHE DOES SEEM TO GUEST THAT. SHE STEPS IN TO MAKE SURE THAT\nWAS NOT HOW THINGS WERE GOING TO CONTINUE.\nAND SURE ENOUGH, DOUG BAND LEFT SHORTLY AFTER THOSE MEMOS WERE\nRELEASED. >> HOWARD, HOW DO YOU READ THIS?\nTHE ONE THING GREAT ABOUT LIFTING UP THIS ROCK IS YOU SEE\nTHE BUG LIFE UNDER THE ROCK. AND YOU SEE ABOUT ALL THIS STUFF\nTHAT NEVER GETS OUT PUBLICLY, I GUESS, WITH THANKS TO THE\nRUSSKIS AND WIKILEAKS, WE NOW GET A VIEW WE NORMALLY DON'T GET\nOF POLITICIANS IN ACTION. >> CHRIS, I'VE BEEN COVERING THE\nCLINTONS SINCE THEY WERE IN LITTLE ROCK.\nAND WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS, AND\nTHROUGH ALL OF HIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS AND HILLARY'S ENTIRE\nCAREER, THEIR WHOLE LIFE IS BUILT ON THE COMBINATION OF\nPUBLIC OFFICE AND MONEY. AND THE CLINTONS DIDN'T HAVE ANY\nMONEY. THEY DIDN'T START OUT WITH ANY\nMONEY. THEY'RE NOT LIKE THE BUSH FAMILY\nOR SOME OTHER PEOPLE -- >> OR THE TRUMP FAMILY.\n>> RIGHT, OR THE TRUMP FAMILY. AND THEY'RE DOWN THERE IN LITTLE\nROCK, AND THEY WANT TO PLAY ON THE NATIONAL STAGE, AND IT\nQUICKLY BECOMES APPARENT TO THEM THAT THEY'VE GOT TO GET IN ON\nTHE MONEY ACTION. NOT SO MUCH, I THINK, BECAUSE\nTHEY'RE PEOPLE, THEY WANT TO BE AROUND THE MONEY, IN ORDER TO\nPLAY IN THE BALL GAME OF POLITICS IN THE WAY IT EXISTS.\n>> WHY DID HILLARY CLINTON DEMAND $250,000 TO GIVE AN\nHOUR-LONG SPEECH. THE SAME SPEECH SHE GIVES OVER\nAND OVER AGAIN. THAT'S NOT ABOUT CAMPAIGNING.\n>> IT'S NOT ABOUT CAMPAIGNING, BUT IT'S ABOUT -- MAYBE I'M\nBEING TOO GENEROUS HERE, BUT THEY SPENT THEIR WHOLE LIVES\nTRYING TO GET CONTRIBUTIONS FROM RICH PEOPLE.\nTHEY'VE IMMERSED THEMSELVES IN THAT, GOING BACK TO RENAISSANCE\nWEEKEND AND THAT NETWORKING BY THE SEA BACK IN THE '80s AND\n'90s. THE BIG DONORS, THE SOFT MONEY\nDONORS. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THEY SPENT\nTHEIR LIVES AROUND, THEY WANT TO BE LIKE THOSE PEOPLE.\nTHEY WANT TO BE LIKE THOSE PEOPLE.\nBECAUSE IT'S DEMEANING TO HAVE TO DO THAT ALL THE TIME.\nTHEY GOING TO BE ON THAT LEVEL, GET THE CASH FOR THEMSELVES.\nMORE IMPORTANT, THEY'RE GOING TO GET THE CASH FOR CAMPAIGN\nCONTRIBUTIONS, FOR PAC CONTRIBUTIONS, FOR THE\nFOUNDATION THAT MAKES THE CLINTONS FEEL GOOD, LIKE THEY'RE\nDOING GOOD IN THE WORLD. IT'S LIKE A CONTINUOUSLY MOVING\nCAR SELL OF ACCESS AND MONEY. NONE OF IT SPECIFICALLY ILLEGAL,\nBUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE TOTALITY OF IT, IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE\nSPENT THEIR WHOLE LIVES SEARCHING FOR CASH, AND USING\nPOWER TO GET IT, TO GET MORE MONEY, TO GET MORE POWER.\nTO GET MORE MONEY. AND THEY HAVE NOT SAID THEY'RE\nGOING TO SHUT DOWN THE CLINTON FOUNDATION THE HILLARY BECOMES\nPRESIDENT. WHAT THEY'VE SAID IS, THEY WILL\nNO LONGER TAKE ANY FOREIGN DONATIONS.\nAND BY THE WAY, CHELSEA CLINTON WASN'T COMPLAINING THAT BILL\nCLINTON -- ABOUT BILL CLINTON LOOKING BAD, FORGETTING CASH FOR\nSPEECHES. SHE WAS COMPLAINING THAT DOUG\nBAND WAS USING THE FOUNDATION TO GET MONEY FOR HIMSELF.\n>> YEAH. >> IT WAS NOT SOME PRINCIPLED\nOBJECTION TO PROTECT HER DAD FROM LOOKING BAD.\nTHEY WANTED AS MUCH MONEY AS THEY COULD GET.\nI MEAN, TWO DAYS AFTER SHE WAS DECLARING HER CANDIDACY IN IOWA,\nHILLARY CLINTON WANTED TO GIVES A SPEECH TO JPMORGAN.\nUNTIL THEY TOLD HER, YOU CAN'T DO IT.\n>> YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK? I'M GOING TO BE MORE JUDGMENTAL\nTHAN BETH WHO'S A STRAIGHT REPORTER.\nI'LL MAKE A JUDGMENT. EVERY TIME I'VE WATCHED A\nPOLITICIAN ENGAGE IN A CERTAIN PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR BEFORE THEY\nGO TO THE WHITE HOUSE, THEY CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN THAT\nPATTERN AFTERWARDS. PEOPLE DON'T CHANGE BECAUSE WE\nSWEAR THEM INTO THE WHITE HOUSE. THEY BECOME THAT PERSON\nBIG-TIME. AND THE CLINTONS WERE RAISING\nMONEY LIKE THIS HAND OVER  MOTEL 6.\nTHEY WERE PULLING THEM IN BY TRAIN LOADS OF CONTRIBUTORS AND\nLETTING THEM SIT IN THE LINCOLN BEDROOM FOR A WHILE AND CHARGING\nTHEM BY THE HOUR. YOU CAN STILL VOTE FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON, BUT REMEMBER, YOU'RE GETTING THIS AS PART OF THE\nPACKAGE, BECAUSE THAT'S, THEIR PATTERN.\nBETH FOUHY, THANK YOU. YOU'RE SO NICE TO THESE PEOPLE.\nUP NEXT, THE CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE HOPING TO KEEP DONALD\nTRUMP FROM WINNING DEEP RED UTAH, EVAN McMULLEN.\nHE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN UTAH.\nIS HE RUNNING ANYWHERE ELSE? THIS IS \"HARDBALL,\" THE PLACE\nFOR POLITICS.",

NO, LISTEN, THERE ARE THINGS\nTHAT BOTH CANDIDATES SAY AND DO THAT I DON'T APPROVE OF.\nI DON'T ADOPT EVERYTHING THAT DONALD TRUMP SAYS OR DOES.\nBUT I'M CONFRONTED WITH A CHOICE BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY\nCLINTON. AND I LOOK AT SOME OF THE\nSCANDALS, THE CORRUPTION, THE DISHONESTY THAT COMES FROM\nMRS. CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN, AND I'LL TAKE A GUY LIKE DONALD\nTRUMP, WHO EVEN TALKS ABOUT A RIGGED ELECTION.\nI DON'T KNOW IF HE GOT PHONE CALLS FROM PEOPLE IN TEXAS ABOUT\nTHOSE MACHINES THAT -- I'M NOT THOSE PHONE CALLS OR IN THE\nCAMPAIGN, YOU KNOW, CONTROL CENTER.\nBUT, AMERICANS ARE CONFRONTED WITH WHO IS A BETTER CHOICE?\nAND I THINK THROUGH THIS ELECTION, I DON'T THINK PEOPLE\nARE REALLY INSPIRED BY EITHER CHOICE BUT THEY HAVE TO ANALYZE\nWHO IS THE BEST CANDIDATE WHO IS GOING TO GROW OUR ECONOMY.\nGIVE US RISING WAGES. CRUSH AND DEFEAT ISIS, SECURE\nOUR BOARD HE, ALL ISSUES THAT WE CARE ABOUT IN WISCONSIN.\nAND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS COMES DOWN TO.\nSO YOU SEE THINGS HAPPENING FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE CAMPAIGNS THAT\nWE MIGHT NOT APPROVE OF AS AMERICANS BUT THE BOTTOM LINE\nIS, WHO IS THE BEST ONE TO LEAD THE COUNTRY FORWARD?\n>> PAUL RYAN WHO IS A FRIEND OF YOURS AND YOU KNOW HIM FELLOW\nWISCONSINERNESS, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, WON'T CAMPAIGN FOR TRUMP\nTHERE HE'S DOING THE DOWN BALLOT RACES MAKING SURE THE PARTY\nSTAYS IN CONTROL OF THE HOUSE HOPEFULLY THE SENATE AS WELL I'M\nSURE HE IS DOING THAT. WHY?\nBECAUSE HE SAYS IN SO MANY WORDS THAT HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO LIVE\nWITH THIS DECISION AFTERWARDS. HOW ARE YOU WITH THAT,\nCONGRESSMAN? ARE YOU CONFIDENT THAT DONALD\nTRUMP WILL NOT SAY OR DO SOMETHING IF PRESIDENT OF THE\nUNITED STATES THAT WILL MAKE YOU REGRET WHAT YOU'RE DOING RIGHT\nNOW TO PUT HIM IN THAT POSITION? >> I'LL COME BACK TO PAUL RYAN\nIN A SECOND. BUT I CAN'T SAY THAT I COULD\nVOTE FOR HILLARY CLINTON AND SHE WON'T SAY AND DO THINGS THAT\nLEAD ME TO BELIEVE THAT SHE USES THE POWER OF THE PRESIDENCY TO\nPERSONALLY BENEFIT HER OWN FAMILY.\nOR THAT SHE'S GOING TO KEEP OUR TOP SECRET INFORMATION SAFE.\nTHOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT WE'RE CONFRONTED WITH.\nBUT BACK TO PAUL RYAN, I MEAN PAUL IS CONFRONTED NOT JUST\nRUNNING FOR CONGRESS IN SOUTHEAST WISCONSIN, PAUL IS\nRESPONSIBLE AS THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF DRIVING A MESSAGE\nABOUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT IDEAS ARE WE BRINGING TO THE AMERICAN\nPEOPLE THAT CAN FIX THE BIG ISSUES THAT CONFRONT OUR COUNTRY\nTODAY? YOU KNOW THIS AND YOU REPORTED\nIT, WE'VE HAD A LOT MORE RACES THAT HAVE COME IN TO PLAY IN\nTHIS OCTOBER, IN THE HOUSE. AND IT'S PAUL'S RESPONSIBILITY\nTO GO OUT THERE AND RAISE MONEY AND MAKE SURE HE BRINGS BACK A\nTEAM THAT IS GOING TO FIGHT FOR COMMONSENSE PRINCIPLES TO REDUCE\nREGULATION, FIX OUR TAX CODE, AND -- AND SO I THINK IT'S\nSMART, HEY I'M GOING TO PIVOT AWAY FROM MR. TRUMP AND FOCUS ON\nMY JOB AS A SPEAKER AND AS A REPUBLICAN MEMBER OF CONGRESS TO\nRAISE MONEY AND FIGHT FOR MY MEMBERS, TO MAKE SURE THEY GO --\n>> YOU KNOW IT'S MORE THAN THAT. YOU KNOW BETTER THAN I DO.\nYOU KNOW HIM WELL. YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS ABOUT\nCONSCIENCE VERSUS CONVENIENCE. YES, YOU SHOULD BACK YOUR\nNOMINEE. THAT'S EASIER.\nIT'S GOING TO BE EASIER WITHIN THE PARTY ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG\nSTARS LIKE YOU. YOU KNOW WHO DOESN'T WANT YOU\nKNOW WHO WHO'S THERE'S NO REASON FOR YOU WANT TO MAKE TROUBLE FOR\nYOURSELF THAT YOU DON'T CREATE YOURSELF.\nBUT HE'S MAKING A DIFFERENT DECISION.\nHE'S SAYING NO I DON'T BUY IT. I DON'T WANT TO OWN IT.\nI DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT I'M ABOUT THE SAME THINGS THAT\nDONALD TRUMP IS. I'M GOING TO BE FOR MY PARTY AND\nTHOSE IDEAS. YOU'RE NOT DOING THAT.\n>> HOLD ON. NO, NO, NO.\nSO PAUL RYAN HASN'T WITHDRAWN HIS SUPPORT OR ENDORSEMENT --\n>> NO BUT HE WON'T CAMPAIGN FOR HIM.\nI MEAN WHEN DOES THAT HAPPEN >> HOLD ON.\nIN WISCONSIN WE HAVE A GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY FROM THE SCOTT\nWALKER -- >> TRUE --\n>> -- BEST PARTY IN THE STATE. IN THE COUNTRY.\nAND PAUL RYAN HAS DRIVEN A MILLION DOLLARS INTO OUR GET OUT\nTHE VOTE OPERATION THAT HELPED SENATOR RON JOHNSON BUT ALSO\nHELPED DONALD TRUMP. PAUL IS DOING THINGS THAT TRULY\nHELP GET OUT OUR VOTE THAT HELP DONALD TRUMP.\nNOW HE MIGHT NOT BE HITTING THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL WITH HIM, BUT THE\nTHINGS THAT HE DOES, IS HELPING OUR TICKET UP AND DOWN FROM THE\nTOP TO THE SENATE, TO HOUSE RACES.\nAND AGAIN, IT'S EASY TO COME AT MAE AND SAY, HEY, DUFFY WHY ARE\nYOU SUPPORTING TRUMP LOOK AT ALL THESE BAD THINGS THAT HE SAYS\nAND DOES. WE ALSO HAVE TO BE CONFRONTED\nWITH LOOK AT ALL THE BAD THINGS THAT HILLARY CLINTON DOES.\nYET, DONALD TRUMP HAS THINGS THAT MAKE THE HAIR ON THE BACK\nOF MY NECK STAND UP. BUT HILLARY CLINTON IS CORRUPT,\nUSING AMERICAN POWER FOR HER OWN PERSONAL GAIN.\nTHAT'S AN AFFRONT TO THE AMERICAN SYSTEM.\nYOU MIGHT DISAGREE WITH PEOPLE ON POLICY, AND DECISIONS THAT\nTHEY MAKE, BUT YOU WOULD -- BUT THAT YOU WOULD BRING WEALTH TO\nYOUR FAMILY FROM A POSITION THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE GAVE YOU, I\nTHINK, AMERICANS COMPLETELY REJECT AND I THINK DEMOCRATS\nSHOULD BE CONFRONTED WITH, YOU KNOW, THOSE QUESTIONS.\nI WOULD LOVE PEOPLE TO ASK MORE HOW COULD YOU -- HOW COULD YOU\nSUPPORT A CANDIDATE LIKE HILLARY CLINTON?\nWHO WOULD DESTROY 33,000 E-MAILS, ONE E-MAILS THAT ARE\nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE'S E-MAILS, BUT AFTER YOU GOT A PRESERVATION\nORDER FROM THE CONGRESS TO KEEP THEM AND TURN THEM OVER, SHE\nDESTROYED THEM WITH A BLEACH BIN -- SHE DESTROYED HER CELL\nPHONE. SO WE COULDN'T RECOVER THAT\nINFORMATION. THIS GOES TO THE HEART OF WHO\nSHE IS AS A PERSON -- >> CONGRESSMAN, YOU DO KNOW THAT\nTHE FBI -- YOU DO KNOW THAT THE FBI FOUND HILLARY CLINTON HAD\nNOTHING TO DO WITH STROIG THE E-MAILS THAT WAS DONE BY AN\nINDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR WHO WAS TOLD TO PRESERVE THEM WHO WAS\nTOLD TO DESTROY THEM EARLIER -- >> OH, COME ON, CHRIS.\n>> HEY THEY DID THE INVESTIGATION.\nI'M NOT LOVING A POLITICAL ARGUMENT.\nI LOVE TO SEE PROSECUTIONS, I'M A LAWYER.\nI'M SAYING THEY FOUND IT. THEY GAVE THE GUY AN IMMUNITY\nDEAL HOPING HE WOULD SAY WHAT YOU JUST SAID AND HE DIDN'T.\nTHAT'S WHY THEY COULDN'T BRING A CASE.\nI'M JUST POINTING OUT FACT. >> CHRIS, WHO -- WHOSE E-MAILS\nARE THEY AND WHOSE CELL PHONE WAS IT?\n>> HEARSE. >> HOW DID THIS PERSON GET HER\nPERSONAL CELL PHONE. >> HEARSE.\n>> THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO DESTROY.\nAND IT WAS MULTIPLE CELL PHONES. AND IF YOU WANT TO GO TO THAT\nEXTENT EVEN WITH THE FBI SHE CAME TO CONGRESS, AND SHE TOLD\nUS THAT SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY SECURE PRIVATE INFORMATION ON\nHER SERVER. RIGHT?\nNO AMERICAN SECRETS. WELL, COMEY CAME IN AND SAID NO,\nNO, SHE DID HAVE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION ON HER SERVER.\n>> RIGHT. >> SO SHE LIED TO THE CONGRESS.\nTHAT'S A CRIME. I'M NOT SAYING SHE SHOULD BE\nPROSECUTED. BUT I'M SAYING, LISTEN, WE HAVE\nREAL ISSUES HERE.

TRUMP PLEASE STOP TALKING ABOUT A RIGGED ELECTION.\nWE HAVE REACHED OUT TO ELECTIONS OFFICIALS IN OHIO, PENNSYLVANIA\nAND TEXAS. THERE IS ZERO EVIDENCE OF A\nRIGGED ELECTION. HERE'S WHAT TRUMP SUPPORT AND\nOHIO SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN HUSTED TOLD ME.\n>> I'LL SAY A COUPLE THINGS. FIRST OF ALL, I CAN REASSURE\nDONALD TRUMP I AM IN CHARGE OF ELECTIONS IN OHIO AND THEY'RE\nNOT GOING TO BE RIGGED. I'LL MAKE SURE OF THAT.\nOUR INSTITUTIONS LIKE OUR ELECTIONS SYSTEM IS ONE OF THE\nBEDROCKS OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY. WE SHOULD NOT QUESTION IT.\n>> TALK OF A RIGGED ELECTION UNDERMINES AMERICA'S DEMOCRACY,\nAND NO, IT IS NOT PATRIOTIC TO THREATEN THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE\nIF MR. TRUMP DOES NOT CONVINCE ENOUGH AMERICANS TO CAST A\nBALLOT FOR HIM. LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS NOW.\nREBECCA BURGH IS WITH ME A NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER FOR\nREAL CLEAR POLITICS. ERR ROLL LEWIS IS HERE, AND ANN\nSTELTER IS PRESIDENT OF THE POLLING FIRM STELTER AND COMPANY\nA VERY WELL RESPECTED POLLING FIRM I MIGHT ADD.\nANN MY FIRST QUESTION TO YOU. OFFICIALS IN YOUR HOME STATE OF\nIOWA ISSUED A STATEMENT REFUTING TRUMP'S CLAIMS, AND SAYING\nTHERE'S BEEN NO EVIDENCE OF TAMPERING WITH THE PROCESS.\nWHAT ARE YOU HEARING FROM IOWANS?\n>> WELL, I CAN TELL YOU THAT SEVERAL YEARS AGO THE FORMER\nSECRETARY OF STATE LAUNCHED A MASSIVE INVESTIGATION INTO WHAT\nWAS HAPPENING WITH VOTER FILES, DID THEY MATCH UP WITH THE\nPEOPLE WHO WERE ACTUALLY ELIGIBLE TO VOTE.\nKIND OF HOPING TO FIND THAT THERE WERE PROBLEMS WITH THE\nFILE. BUT WE GOT THE GOOD HOUSEKEEPING\nSEAL OF APPROVAL. THAT IS OUR FILES ARE CLEAN.\nAND WE KEEP THEM CLEAN. AND THERE -- SO THERE'S JUST, IN\nTHAT WAY THAT YOU CAN DEFINE RIGGING, NO EVIDENCE THAT THAT'S\nREALLY POSSIBLE IN IOWA. >> SO, ERROL, FORMER GOP\nCONGRESSMAN JOE WALSH OF ILLINOIS, WHO IS KNOWN FORIBLE\nFLAPPER TO LANGUAGE IS RAISING EYEBROWS AFTER TWEETING THIS.\nQUOTE, ON NOVEMBER 8th, I'M VOTING FOR TRUMP.\nON NOVEMBER 9th, IF TRUMP LOSES I'M GRABBING MY MUSKET.\nYOU IN? HE ENDED THE TWEET LIKE THAT.\nWALSH DEFENDS HIS COMMENTSLE IN A CNN INTERVIEW THIS MORNING.\n>> WHEN I SAY GRAB YOUR MUSKET, MAN AND LET'S GO TO WAR, IF\nHILLARY WINS, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S GOING TO BE IN OUR\nSIGHTS. BECAUSE ALL THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE\nPISSED OFF AGAIN AT WHAT WE BELIEVE, CHRIS, IS A CORRUPT\nPOLITICAL SYSTEM, WE'RE AS ANGRY AT REPUBLICANS AS WE ARE AT\nDEMOCRATS. EVEN IF TRUMP LOSES, FAIR AND\nSQUARE, CHRIS, THE ANGER IS NOT GOING TO GO ANYWHERE.\n>> SO, ERROL, WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT HE MEANS BY THAT?\n>> I'LL TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD THAT GRAB YOUR MUSKET MEANS\nATTACKING FELLOW REPUBLICANS AND TRYING TO SORT OF CHANGE THE\nPARTY AROUND BY LEGAL MEANS. IT'S THAT KIND OF ROUGH TALK,\nTHOUGH, IT'S THAT KIND OF SORT OF BORDERLINE VIOLENT TALK WITH\nTHESE SORT OF INTIMATIONS THAT CAN CROSS THE LINE BETWEEN BEING\nPASSIONATE AND COLORFUL AND BEING SORT OF MENACING AND\nTHREATENING. AND I THINK THERE'S BEEN A LOT\nOF DISCUSSION, PEOPLE SEEM TO BE A LITTLE BIT UNEASY ABOUT THE\nPROSPECT OF THAT. I PERSONALLY DON'T FEEL THAT\nWAY. I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR LAW\nENFORCEMENT, FOR THE MILITARY, FOR THE CUSTOMS AND TRADITIONS\nTHAT HOLD THE COUNTRY TOGETHER. IF A FEW PEOPLE WANT TO REALLY\nSERIOUSLY ACT OUT, I THINK IN ALMOST EVERY JURISDICTION IN\nTHIS COUNTRY THERE'S SOMEBODY THERE WHO IS READY TO SORT OF\nGET THEM BACK WITHIN THE LINES IF THEY REALLY WANT TO SORT OF\nACT CRAZY. YOU KNOW, THE REALITY IS ONE OF\nTHE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS OF DEMOCRACY IS THAT SOMETIMES YOU\nLOSE. SOMETIMES YOUR CANDIDATE LOSES.\nNOT THAT YOU DID ANYTHING WRONG. NOT BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE\nBEST IDEAS BUT BECAUSE WE DO OPERATE ON A SYSTEM THAT\nINVOLVES THE MAJORITY SORT OF MAKING A DETERMINATION AND\nTHAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE HAPPEN ON NOVEMBER 8th.\n>> REBECCA, THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THE ANGER WILL REMAIN, YOU\nKNOW, IF DONALD TRUMP LOSES. RIGHT?\nIF HILLARY CLINTON BECOMES PRESIDENT.\nTHERE WILL BE ANGER THERE. AND THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH\nACTS OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT, THAT\nHAPPENS ALL THE TIME IN OUR COUNTRY.\nBUT THE WAY IT'S BEING DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW IS DISTURBING.\n>> ABSOLUTELY. AND IT MATTERS.\nTHESE WORDS MATTER ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE COMING FROM PUBLIC\nOFFICIALS OR FORMER PUBLIC OFFICIALS WHO HAVE A MEG APHONE\nWHO HAVE A LARGER PLATFORM THAN SOMM SOMEONE ON FACEBOOK OR\nTWITTER WOULD HAVE AS EVIDENCED BY THE FACT WE'RE INTERVIEWING\nJOE WALSH, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS.\nIT MATTERS THAT THEY USE THESE WORDS.\nAND SO THERE IS THE RISK OF, YOU KNOW, HOW ARE PEOPLE GOING TO\nACT OUT ON THEIR ANGER AFTER THIS ELECTION?\nWHO ARE THEY GOING TO DIRECT THEIR ANGER AT?\nDONALD TRUMP IS ALREADY OUT THERE TALKING AS WE KNOW ABOUT\nTHIS RIGGED ELECTION. ARE THEY GOING TO DIRECT THEIR\nANGER AT ELECTION OFFICIALS IN THE STATES?\nARE THEY GOING TO DOUBT THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION?\nTHESE ARE ALL REALLY RELEVANT QUESTIONS AT THIS POINT AND THIS\nISN'T REALLY A SCENARIO WE HAVE FACED TO THIS EXTENT IN RECENT\nELECTIONS. >> BUT I JUST WANT TO GO BACK TO\nTHIS NOTION OF A RIGGED ELECTION, THAT THERE'S MASSIVE\nVOTER FRAUD ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY.\nBECAUSE -- AND I JUST WANT TO LOOK AT THIS LOGICALLY RIGHT\nNOW. SO LET'S LOOK AT THE STATE OF\nTEXAS, WHERE MR. TRUMP IS SAYING THAT THERE ARE INSTANCES OF\nVOTER FRAUD AND HE'S AFRAID THAT HE'S GOING TO LOSE THE ELECTION\nTHERE. YES, THERE WERE A HANDFUL OF\nSUSPECT BALLOTS IN TEXAS. IT HAPPENS.\nNO SYSTEM IS PERFECT. BUT LET'S ASSUME THE PROBLEM IS\nRAMPANT. TEXAS HAS A REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR,\nA REPUBLICAN SECRETARY OF STATE, BOTH U.S. SENATORS ARE\nREPUBLICANS, 25 TEXAS REPUBLICANS WERE ELECTED TO THE\nHOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, INCLUDING MANY TRUMP SUPPORTERS,\nYES MR. TRUMP DID NOT WIN TEXAS DURING THE PRIMARY BUT ANOTHER\nREPUBLICAN NATIVE SON DID AND THAT WOULD BE TED CRUZ.\nSO, IF INDEED THERE IS WIDESPREAD VOTER FRAUD IN TEXAS,\nWHY ARE THERE SO MANY REPUBLICANS IN OFFICE?\n>> YOU'RE COMING TO ME FOR THAT? >> YES.\n>> I THINK THE ANSWER IS THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF\nMONITORING OF BOTH PARTIES, IN THE ACTUAL PROCESS.\nAND I THINK IN 2, ONE OF THE REASONS THAT IT IS SO REPUBLICAN\nDOMINATED HAS TO DO WITH THE WAY THE CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS ARE\nDRAWN. AND WHEN YOU HAVE CONTROL OF ONE\nPARTY WHO THEN CONTROLS THAT PROCESS, YOU END UP WITH A LOT\nOF PEOPLE FROM THAT PARTY ELECTED TO OFFICE.\nI THINK, YOU KNOW, THE QUESTION REALLY WHEN YOU HEAR THE WORD\nRIGGED, PEOPLE IMMEDIATELY THINK THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE SHOWING UP\nIN PERSON TO VOTE WHO ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO VOTE.\nAND I DON'T THINK ANYWHERE WE HAVE FOUND THAT -- THAT THERE'S\nEVIDENCE OF THAT. BUT THERE ARE MANY OTHER PARTS\nOF THE SNAKE THAT IS THE PROCESS OF VOTING AND COUNTING THOSE\nVOTES. AND SO I THINK, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE\nWORRIED ABOUT WHETHER IT'S -- YOU CAN HACK INTO THAT SYSTEM.\nWHETHER PUBLIC OFFICIALS COULD CHANGE NUMBERS IN THE TALLIES.\nAGAIN, THERE ARE OBSERVERS FOR ALL OF THESE PROCESSES IF IT'S\nMORE SUN LIGHT THAN ANYTHING ELSE, SO, IT WILL BE INTERESTING\nTO SEE IF THERE END UP BEING CREDIBLE CHALLENGES TO RIGGING.\nIT SEEMS LIKE THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED AGAINST RIGGING.\n>> OH, I LIKE THAT. VERY FUN.\nERROL LEWIS, REBECCABERG, ANY SELTZER, THANKS SO MUCH FOR\nJOINING ME THIS MORNING. NOW TO MIKE PENCE'S HARROWING\nLANDING. CNN'S DEBORAH FEYERICK IS LIVE\nAT LaGUARDIA TO TELL US MORE ABOUT THAT.\nHI, DEBORAH. >> HEY THERE, CAROL.\nWELL IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME A PLANE HAS ACTUALLY SKIDDED OFF\nTHE RUNWAY HERE AT LaGUARDIA AIRPORT.\nWHAT MAKES IT UNIQUE IS THE FACT THAT THIS WAS A PLANE BELONGING\nTO THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE.\nNOW OFFICIALS SAY THAT IT OVERSHOT THE RUNWAY AND LANDED\nWAY TOO QUICKLY. PEEL ON BOARD THE PLANE SAY IT\nHAPPENED SO FAST, THAT THEY DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE THE PLANE\nWAS ON THE GRASS UNTIL AFTER THEY GOT OFF THAT PLANE.\n>> WE HAVE A EMERGENCY IN THE AIRPORT.\n>> A FRIGHTENING EXPERIENCE FOR DONALD TRUMP'S RUNNING MATE MIKE\nPENCE. >> WHEN WE LANDED IT WAS OBVIOUS\nTHAT THE PILOTS WERE BREAKING VERY AGGRESSIVELY ON THE RUNWAY.\nWE COULD FEEL THAT. AND THEN, WE BEGAN TO FEEL THE\nPLANE FISHTAIL A LITTLE BIT. >> FLYING IN FROM FORT DODGE,\nIOWA, THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN'S CHARTER PLANE CARRYING THE\nINDIANA GOVERNOR SKIDDING OFF THE RUNWAY UPON LANDING AT NEW\nYORK'S LaGUARDIA AIRPORT. >> WE WERE MOVING DOWN THE\nRUNWAY MUCH MORE QUICKLY THAN A PLANE SHOULD BE GOING IF IT'S\nLANDING. >> Reporter: INVESTIGATORS WILL\nBE LOOKING AT A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING WEATHER.\nONE LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCE TELLING CNN IT APPEARS PENCE'S\nPLANE CAME IN TOO FAST AND LANDED TOO LATE ON A RAIN-SOAKED\nRUNWAY. THE PLANE WAS SLOWED THANKS TO\nCEMENT BLOCKS INSTALLED AT THE END OF THE RUNWAY, PREVENTING\nTHE PLANE FROM CAREENING ONTO A MAJOR HIGHWAY.\n>> THE PLANE ENDED UP IN THE ARRESTER BED AT THE END OF THE\nRUNWAY, DESTROYED ABOUT 80 ARRESTER BED BLOCKS.\n>> Reporter: THE PLANE, COMING TO A STOP DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO\nTRAFFIC. A SAFETY LAYER ON THE RUNWAY\nTORN UP, AVOIDING A CATASTROPHE. >> EASTERN STOP, STOP.\nGO AROUND. GO AROUND JET BLUE 1640.\n>> AUDIO FROM THE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL TOWER CAPTURING THE\nTENSE MOMENTS WITH CREWS ARRIVING ON SCENE WITHIN ONE\nMINUTE. >> WE'RE GETTING HELP FOR YOU.\n>> Reporter: OFFICIALS SAY PENCE WAS REASSURED BY FLASHING LIGHTS\nUPON EXITING THE PLANE. LATER TWEETING SO THANKFUL\nEVERYONE ON OUR PLANE IS SAFE. TRUMP REACTING TO THE SCARE AT A\nRALLY. >> I JUST SPOKE TO MIKE PENCE,\nAND HE'S FINE. >> AND YOU HEARD MIKE PENCE\nDISCUSS THE LIGHTS THAT HE SAW BY THE PLANE.\nEMERGENCY VEHICLES NEXT TO THAT PLANE WITHIN MOMENTS OF THIS ALL\nHAPPENING. THEY ACTUALLY PRACTICED FOR\nTHOSE KINDS OF ACCIDENTS OR INCIDENTS I SHOULD SAY TO\nHAPPEN. THE NTSB IS COMING IN FROM\nWASHINGTON TO INVESTIGATE WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE AND WHY\nTHIS OCCURRED. IN THE MEANTIME, A NEW PLANE\nCHARTERED BOEING 737 IS BEING FLOWN UP IN THE SAME COMPANY AND\nMIKE PENCE WILL BE ON THAT PLANE TO CAMPAIGN.\nHE WILL BE LEAVING THIS TIME OUT OF NEWARK.\nCAROL? >> ALL RIGHT, DEBORAH FEYERICK\nREPORTING LIVE FOR US. THANKS SO MUCH.\nSTILL TO COME IN THE \"NEWSROOM,\" THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE FOR VOTERS\nIS THE ECONOMY, STUPID. AND IS IT FINALLY ABOUT TO BE\nFRONT AND CENTER ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL?

LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID JUST LAST\nNIGHT. >> YOU LOOK AT TEXAS, A LOT OF\nCALLS WERE MADE FROM TEXAS, AN INCREDIBLE PRALACE, I LOVE TEXA.\nTHE LINES ARE MASSIVE AND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT FRLIPPING,\nWHERE THEY PRESS A BUTTON FOR ME AND ANOTHER NAME COMES UP.\n>> DO WE HAVE ANY DATA, ANY FACTS ON THAT?\n>> NO, THEY JUST CALL IN. >> SO THE TEXAS OFFICIAL WHO IS\nIN CHARGE OF THAT PARTICULAR AREA WHERE THAT ALLEGED INCIDENT\nTOOK PLACE, SHANNON LACKEY IS THE ELECTION ADMINISTRATOR FOR\nRANDALL COUNTY, TEXAS. HERE'S WHAT -- THE STATEMENT\nTHAT CAME OUT FOR THAT. ABSOLUTELY NOT.\nIT IS NOT HAPPENING IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM.\nI STAND 100% BEHIND WHAT I DO. I STAND BEHIND MY MACHINES, MY\nSTAFF. AGAIN, THAT COMING FROM SHANNON\nLACKEY, THE ELECTION ADMINISTRATOR FROM RANDALL\nCOUNTY, TEXAS. ALSO, WE SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT\nTHAT THE FIRST LADY WAS OUT CAMPAIGNING FOR CLINTON.\nTHIS ALSO HAPPENING YESTERDAY. THERE'S BEEN SOME TALK OF VOTER\nSUPPRESSION BY THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN ALLEGEDLY TRYING TO SUPPRESS THE VOTERS OF\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS AND YOUNG WOMEN.\nTHE FIRST LADY SPEAKING OUT ABOUT THAT JUST YESTERDAY.\n>> SO WHEN YOU HEAR FOLKS TALKING ABOUT A GLOBAL\nCONSPIRACY AND SAYING THAT THIS ELECTION IS RIGGED, UNDERSTAND\nTHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO GET YOU TO STAY HOME.\nTHEY ARE TRYING TO CONVINCE YOU THAT YOUR VOTE DOESN'T MATTER,\nTHAT THE OUTCOME HAS ALREADY BEEN DETERMINED AND YOU\nSHOULDN'T EVEN BOTHER MAKING YOUR VOICE HEARD.\nTHEY ARE TRYING TO TAKE AWAY YOUR HOPE.\n>> IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT A NUMBER OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS THAT\nI HAVE SPOKEN TO REALLY DO BELIEVE WHAT TRUMP IS SAYING.\nTHEY DO BELIEVE THAT THIS ELECTION IS SOMEHOW RIGGED IN\nSOME WAY, SHAPE OR FORM, ONCE AGAIN EVEN THOUGH THERE IS NO\nEVIDENCE FOR THAT. BUT AGAIN, THESE TWO CANDIDATES\nARE GOING TO BE BATTLING UNTIL THE VERY VERY LAST MOMENT.\nTRUMP FOR HIS PART IS GOING TO BE OUT IN PLACES LIKE IOWA.\nHE'S GOING TO BE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.\nHE'S GOING TO BE IN MAINE, MAKING THREE STOPS.\nTRUMP -- CLINTON FOR HER PART, SHE'S NOT GIVING UP ON IOWA,\nEITHER, MAKING TWO STOPS THERE. THE PRESIDENT WILL BE\nCAMPAIGNING FOR HER TODAY IN FLORIDA.\n>> JASON, THANKS SO MUCH. LET'S TALK ABOUT ALL OF THIS.\nBECAUSE THERE IS A LOT TO TALK ABOUT THIS MORNING.\nWITH ME, JACKIE KUCINICH, POLITICAL ANALYST AND WASHINGTON\nBUREAU CHIEF OF THE DAILY BEAST AND DAVID SWORDLICH, ASSISTANT\nEDITOR AT \"THE WASHINGTON POST.\" LET'S START WITH JOE BIDEN.\nSO SOMEBODY WITHIN THE CLINTON CAMP FLOATED JOE BIDEN'S NAME\nOUT THERE. ANY IDEA WHAT THE REASON IS?\n>> I MEAN, THIS DOES SEEM LIKE A TRIAL BALLOON.\nI THINK ELISE HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD.\nTHERE'S A LONG LIST OF PEOPLE AND YOU DO START, THIS IS VERY\nCOMMON AT THIS STAGE OF THE CAMPAIGN, YOU DO START HEARING\nNAMES OF PEOPLE THAT WILL BE IN POSITIONS OF POWER.\nJOE BIDEN HAS CAMPAIGNED VERY HARD FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nHAS REALLY PUT HIMSELF OUT THERE FOR HER.\nAND THE CLINTONS REALLY LIKE LOYALTY SO IT'S NOT COMPLETELY\nOUT OF THE REALM OF POSSIBILITY, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE PROBABLY A LOT\nOF PEOPLE ARE BEING VETTED AT THIS POINT FOR THOSE SENIOR\nPOSITIONS IN THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION SHOULD HILLARY\nCLINTON WIN. >> SO YOU KNOW WHAT SOME PEOPLE\nARE GOING TO SAY, THEY ARE GOING TO SAY WELL, SHE'S ALREADY\nNAMING HER CABINET POSITIONS, THIS IS KIND OF ARROGANT.\nOTHER PEOPLE WILL SAY YOU KNOW WHAT, FLOATING JOE BIDEN'S NAME\nOUT THERE MIGHT ATTRACT BLUE COLLAR VOTERS HILLARY CLINTON\nNEEDS TO WIN THE ELECTION. >> YEAH.\nTHERE IS A CERTAIN SEGMENT THAT REALLY LIKES JOE BIDEN.\nI AGREE WITH JACKIE THAT THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF AN OUTSIDE THE\nBOX PICK BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS THE FORMER CHAIR OF THE\nSENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE AND THE CURRENT VICE\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SO HE CERTAINLY HAS THE RESUME.\nYEAH, THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN DOES NOT WANT TO GET TOO FAR AHEAD OF\nITSELF BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I THINK LIKE JACKIE SAID, THIS IS\nA TRIAL BALLOON OF A KNOWN FIGURE, SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN OUT\nON THE TRAIL FOR CLINTON IN THE PAST FEW DAYS SO I'M NOT\nCOMPLETELY SURPRISED. >> SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS\nNOTION OF A RIGGED ELECTION. YOU HEARD WHAT MICHELLE OBAMA IS\nSAYING. SHE SAYS DONALD TRUMP IS SAYING\nTHIS TO SUPPRESS THE VOTE. WHAT IS THE STRATEGY THERE?\n>> YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING STRATEGY BECAUSE MOST VOTERS ARE\nSEEING IN POLLS THE LAST COUPLE DAYS DON'T NECESSARILY BELIEVE\nTHIS. PR\n'TRUMP VOTERS TEND TO BELIEVE IT MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE.\nTHE INTERESTING THING IS YOU DO SEE A DISCONNECT BETWEEN WHAT\nDONALD TRUMP IS SAYING AND WHAT HIS RUNNING MATE IS SAYING, MIKE\nPENCE. HE SAID THIS MORNING HE BELIEVES\nIN THE SYSTEM. ALSO, PARTICULARLY WITH THIS\nTEXAS ARGUMENT, TEXAS IS RUN BY REPUBLICANS.\nTHE GOVERNOR IS REPUBLICAN, THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR IS\nREPUBLICAN, SECRETARY OF STATE IS REPUBLICAN.\nTHE IDEA THAT EVERYONE WOULD BE COLLUDING TO ELECT HILLARY\nCLINTON IS A LITTLE BEYOND THE REALM.\n>> JUST GOING MORE ALONG THOSE LINES, BECAUSE NO SYSTEM IS\nPERFECT, RIGHT? THERE'S GOING TO BE MISTAKES\nMADE. THERE'S MISTAKES MADE BUT THEY\nARE USUALLY CAUGHT AND THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT THERE'S\nWIDESPREAD FRAUD IN ANY STATE IN AMERICA WHEN IT COMES TO GOING\nTO THE POLLS AND VOTING. BUT GOING BACK TO TEXAS,\nJACKIE'S RIGHT, HAS A REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR, REPUBLICAN SECRETARY\nOF STATE, BOTH U.S. SENATORS ARE REPUBLICAN, 25 TEXAS REPUBLICANS\nWERE ELECTED TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES INCLUDING MANY\nTRUMP SUPPORTERS. SO IT DEFIES LOGIC, DOESN'T IT?\n>> WELL, LOOK, THE ALLEGATIONS OR THE CONCERNS SHOULD BE LOOKED\nINTO AND THE TEXAS OFFICIALS APPARENTLY DID LOOK INTO IT AND\nSAID THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.\nBUT YEAH, AS YOU SAY, TEXAS IS RUN BY REPUBLICANS SO IT WOULD\nBE HARD TO IMAGINE THE FIX IS IN FOR A DEMOCRAT.\nLOOK, WE HAVE A 50-STATE REPUBLIC HERE.\nEVERY STATE, EVERY COUNTY RUNS IT A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY.\nEVERY CONCERN ABOUT IRREGULARITIES SHOULD BE\nEVALUATED BUT WHEN TRUMP IS MAKING THIS ARGUMENT THAT\nTHERE'S A SYSTEMIC FIX IN FOR SECRETARY CLINTON MY RESPONSE TO\nTHAT IS SIMPLY SHOW US THE EVIDENCE.\nHE MADE THIS POINT ON BILL O'REILLY LAST NIGHT, NOT JUST\nSAYING THAT THERE'S VOTER FRAUD HERE OR THERE BUT THAT THE\nWHOLE -- HE'S GONE AND SAID THIS THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS, THAT IT'S\nNOT THE SPECIFIC STATES THAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT, IT'S THAT\nIT'S THE SYSTEM, THE MEDIA AND THE POLITICAL CLASS BUT HE'S\nOFFERED NO EVIDENCE AND AS I HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR THE PAST\nSEVERAL DAYS, LOOK, TRUMP CAMPAIGN, YOU KNOW, THE MEDIA\nHAS COVERED THIS CAMPAIGN CLOSELY FOR A YEAR AND A HALF.\nTHERE'S PLENTY OF INFORMATION OUT THERE ABOUT DONALD TRUMP,\nABOUT SECRETARY CLINTON, FOR VOTERS TO MAKE AN INFORMED\nCHOICE IN THIS RACE. THINGS HAVE NOT BEEN HIDDEN IN\nTHIS RACE. IT'S BEEN CLOSELY COVERED AND\nVOTERS WILL HAVE THEIR SAY IN A FEW DAYS.\n>> YOU KNOW, I'M WITH YOU. I DON'T THINK VOTERS ARE STUPID.\nI THINK THEY CAN MAKE UP THEIR OWN MINDS.\nTO ASSUME THAT WE ARE FORCE-FEEDING THEM THINGS AND\nBRAINWASHING THEM IN SOME WAY IS A DISSERVICE TO AMERICAN VOTERS,\nIN MY MIND. I WILL LEAVE IT THERE.\nTHANKS SO MUCH.",

ALL OF THEM.\n13 DAYS LATER, THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS RELEASED NO\nEVIDENCE ABOUT ANY OF THOSE ACCUSATIONS.\nAND NOW, WITH JUST 11 DAYS LEFT IN THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, A\n12th WOMAN HAS COME FORWARD, ACCUSING DONALD TRUMP OF\nGRABBING HER. NINY LOCHSANEN SAYS HE GRABBED\nHER MOMENTS BEFORE SHE APPEARED ON THE LATE SHOW WITH DAVID\nLETTERMAN. HE OWNED THE PAGEANT AT THAT\nTIME. NBC NEWS HASN'T CONFIRMED THESE\nNEW ALLEGATIONS. SHY ALSO TOLD A FINNISH\nNEWSPAPER, SOMEBODY TOLD ME THERE THAT TRUMP LIKED ME,\nBECAUSE I LOOKED LIKE MELANIA, WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER.\nIT LEFT ME DISGUSTED. IN AN INTERVIEW TAPED BEFORE THE\nLATEST ACCUSATIONS FROM THE FORMER MS. FINLAND, MELANIA\nTRUMP SAID THIS. >> THEY WERE, THEY WERE LIES.\nAND, AS I SAID BEFORE, ALL THE ACCUSATIONS, THEY SHOULD BE\nHANDLED IN A COURT OF LAW. >> SO YOU BELIEVE THE LAWSUIT\nSHOULD GO FORWARD? >> YES, I BELIEVE THAT, AND\nBECAUSE TO ACCUSE SOMEBODY WITHOUT EVIDENCE, IT'S VERY\nHURTFUL, AND IT'S VERY DAMAGING AND UNFAIR.\n>> THE LAWSUITS THAT GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS REFERRED TO OF\nCOURSE WERE THE ONES DONALD TRUMP THREATENED TO SUE HIS\nACCUSERS. ATTORNEY GLORIA ALLRED\nREPRESENTS THREE OF THOSE SUPPORTERS, ALSO IS A HILLARY\nCLINTON SUPPORTER.

HAS HE NEVER HEARD OF THE FIRST\nAMENDMENT? HAS HE NEVER HEARD OF FREE\nSPEECH? THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO\nCOME TO THIS COUNTRY, BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO EXERCISE\nTHE FREE SPEECH THAT THEY CANNOT EXERCISE IN MANY PARTS OF THE\nWORLD. IN FACT, IF THEY DO EXERCISE IT\nAND CRITICIZE THEIR PRESIDENT OR EVEN SOMEONE WHO MIGHT WISH TO\nBE PRESIDENT, THEY FACE POSSIBLE ARRESTS, POSSIBLE PROSECUTION.\nWE HAVE THAT WONDERFUL FIRST AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES\nCONSTITUTION, FREE SPEECH, AND MR. TRUMP HAS TO UNDERSTAND THAT\nHE SHOULD NOT BE THREATENING ANYONE WHO JUST DISPLEASES HIM,\nCRITICIZES HIM, HE NEEDS TO GET OVER IT.\nLET HIM GIVE HIS DEFENSE WITHOUT BULLYING HIS WAY INTO THE WHITE\nHOUSE AND THEN SPENDING HIS TIME, IF GOD FORBID, HE GETS\nTHERE, SITTING IN DEPOSITIONS AS YOU JUST SAID, WITH ALL OF THE\nPEOPLE THAT HE'S SUED. I MEAN, HOW IS HE GOING TO DEAL\nWITH ANY MAJOR CRISIS OF OUR NATION IF THERE IS ONE, IF HE'S\nSITTING IN A DEPOSITION AND TRYING TO DEFEND THE LAWSUITS,\nWHICH, BY THE WAY, MIGHT BE FILED AGAINST HIM OR IF HE DOES\nFILE AGAINST THE WOMEN WOULD HE MIGHT FACE A LAWSUIT THEN, A\nCROSS COMPLAINT, BECAUSE HE'S ALLEGED ACTIONS THAT ARE, HE'S\nALLEGED THAT THEY HAVE DEFAMED HIM, AND THEY MAY ALLEGE THAT HE\nDEFAMED THEM, BY CALLING THEM LIARS, BY SAYING THEIR CLAIMS\nARE FABRICATION, THAT IT'S FICTION.\nBE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR, MR. TRUMP, BECAUSE YOU JUST\nMIGHT GET IT. >> LET ME GET YOUR REACTION TO\nTHIS LATEST THREAT ISSUED IN THE LAST HOUR AND A HALF OF SUING\nNBC FOR THE RELEASE OF THE ACCESSION HOLLYWOOD VIDEO.\nCAN YOU SEE ANY CAUSE OF ACTION IN THAT?\n>> WELL, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL THE TRUE FACTS ARE,\nLAWRENCE. AND I CERTAINLY DON'T GET MY\nFACTS FROM DONALD TRUMP. GIVEN THE LIST OF LIES THAT HE\nHAS SAID ABOUT SO MANY PEOPLE, THEY'RE ALL LISTED ON THE\nINTERNET, I MEAN, YOU CAN'T EVEN KEEP UP WITH THEM.\nSO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE KNEW THAT HIS MIC WAS HOT.\nI DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CONTRACTS SAY, IF ANYTHING, ABOUT WHETHER,\nWHAT HE WAS SAYING WHEN HE WAS MIKED, COULD BE USED AT ANY\nOTHER TIME. I DON'T KNOW HOW THOSE TAPES\nULTIMATELY BECAME PUBLIC, WHETHER NBC HAD ANYTHING TO DO\nWITH THEM, HOW IT CAME INTO POSSESSION OF SOMEONE.\nTHESE ARE JUST UNKNOWN FACTS, SO I CAN'T SPECULATE.\nUNLIKE DONALD TRUMP, UNLESS I HAVE THE TRUE FACTS, I DON'T\nDRAW CONCLUSIONS. BUT WHY DON'T YOU, NBC, JUST SAY\nGAME ON, DONALD TRUMP, IF THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS TO DO, IF HE WANTS\nTO FIGHT IT OUT IN A LAWSUIT, OKAY, HE'LL FIGHT IT OUT IN A\nLAWSUIT. >> QUICKLY BEFORE WE GO, WHAT\nWOULD BE YOUR DEFENSE STRATEGY IF DONALD TRUMP DID FILE ONE OF\nTHESE LAWSUITS? >> WELL, I CAN TELL YOU THAT\nHE'S NOT GOING TO MAKE WOMEN COWER.\nTHOSE DAYS OF BULLYING WOMEN, AND MANY WOMEN ARE STILL BEING\nBULLIED AT HOME, IN THEIR WORKPLACE, IN THEIR COMMUNITY,\nAND WE'RE JUST NOT GOING TO TAKE IT ANYMORE.\nTHESE WOMEN, IF THEY ARE SUED BY DONALD TRUMP, AT LEAST THE ONES\nTHAT I REPRESENT, WE HAVE A, I'M GOING TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND THEM.\nWE HAVE ARMIES OF ATTORNEYS WHO ARE GOING TO BE AVAILABLE TO\nEVEN REPRESENT PERHAPS THOSE WOMEN THAT I DON'T REPRESENT.\nTHERE'S GOING TO BE A WELL-FUNDED DEFENSE.\nSO ALL YOUR ATTEMPTS TO MAKE WOMEN COWER IN FEAR, MR. TRUMP,\nARE GOING TO BE COMPLETE LAY UNSUCCESSFUL, AS TO ME, AS I\nHAVE SAID, SMARTER, RICHER AND MORE FAMOUS PEOPLE THAN YOU, MR.\nTRUMP, HAVE TRIED TO THREATEN ME AND FAILED.\n>> YOU SOUND EAGER TO GET HIM UNDER OATH IN A DEPOSITION.\n>> IT WOULD BE MY PLEASURE. >> THANK YOU FOR JOINING US\nTONIGHT, REALLY APPRECIATE IT.",

TOTAL FABRICATION.\nTHE EVENTS NEVER HAPPENED. NEVER.\nALL OF THESE LIARS WILL BE SUED AFTER THE ELECTION IS OVER.\n>> SO THAT RAISES THE QUESTION, WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN NOW AND\nTHEN?

I CAN'T IMAGINE A MORE BLATANT\nVIOLATION OF THE SPIRIT OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND THE\nCONSTITUTION. THE STATEMENT HE PLAYED HE SAID\nWE WILL SEE.

HE'S A PUBLIC FIGURE, PROBABLY\nTHE MOST FAMOUS PERSON PERSON IN THE WORLD.\nTHE LIBEL STANDARD UNDER THE CASE CREATE A TREMENDOUS BURDEN.\nHE'D HAVE TO PROVE KNOWLEDGE OF FALSITY BY THE INDIVIDUALS.\nHE'D HAVE TO PROVE RECKLESS DISREGARD OF THE TRUTH.\nTHE STANDARDS ARE INSURMOUNTABLE FOR HIM.\nMRS. TRUMP SAID THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THERE'S EVIDENCE.\nTHE WOMEN HAVE COME FORWARD IN VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES AND\nTOLD THEIR STORIES AND THEIR -- WHAT THEY SAID HAPPENED.\nTHAT'S EVIDENCE. THAT'S DIRECT EVIDENCE.\nHE WOULD HAVE TO COUNTERTHAT WITH HIS OWN CLEAR AND\nCONVINCING EVIDENCE I DON'T THINK HE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO\nTHAT. HE WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH\nDEPOSITIONS.

A CAMPAIGN'L FOR THE PRESIDENCY.\nTHAT'S WHERE THE FIRST AMENDMENT PROTECTIONS OF FREE SPEECH ARE\nAT THE HIGHEST, STRICTEST LEVEL. AT BOTTOM, THE FIRST AMENDMENT\nIS PROTECTING THE PEOPLE'S RIGHTS TO GATHER INFORMATION SO\nTHEY CAN GOVERN THEMSELVES. HERE WHERE WE HAVE A CAMPAIGN\nGOING, THESE ARE INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS SPEAKING OUT DURING AN\nELECTION. THEY HAVE EVERY FUNDAMENTAL\nRIGHT TO DO THAT. JUST TO CALL SOMETHING SLANDER\nTO DENY IT DOES NOT MEAN IT IS PROTECTED SPEECH.\nTHE CONSTITUTION CREATES WHAT THE SUPREME COURT HAS CALLED\nBREATHING SPACE AND TOLERATES CAUSTIC DEBATE, CRITICISM,\nPARTICULARLY OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, PARTICULARLY OF\nWEALTHY, POWERFUL INDIVIDUALS WHO WANT TO BE PRESIDENT.\nSO THIS IS THE ESSENCE OF WHAT THE FRAMERS OF OUR CONSTITUTION\nHAD IN MIND IN TERMS OF THE KIND OF DEBATE AND ARGUMENT ABOUT WHO\nSHOULD BE PRESIDENT. MR. TRUMP'S IN THE POSITION TO\nRESPOND. HE COULD LAY OUT HIS SIDE OF THE\nFACTS INSTEAD OF BRANDING PEOPLE LIARS.\nHELP HAS THE POWER AND ABILITY AND PLATFORM TO RESPOND WITH HIS\nOWN SPEECH. >> QUICKLY, HOW MANY OTHER\nLAWYERS HAVE SIGNED UP FOR THIS AND WHAT MESSAGE ARE YOU SENDING\nTO MR.

I MEAN THAT LITERALLY.\nWIN OR LOSE HER CAMPAIGN SAYS SHE WILL MAKE A SPEECH FROM\nJAVITZ CONVENTION CENTER AND WIN OR LOSE, HER CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN\nHISTORIC. IT'S A BIT JARRING TO THINK THAT\nJUST 45 YEARS AGO, THIS WAS ACTUALLY HAPPENING IN MAJOR\nAMERICAN NEWSROOMS. >> THAT WAS ME.\nHE DID WRITE A COURT STORY. I REWROTE IT.\n>> GIRLS DO NOT DO REWRITES. >> WHY NOT?\n>> THAT'S SIMPLY HOW WE DO THINGS HERE.\nWE HAVE RULES, PROTOCOL. >> THOSE RULES ARE DUMB.\nIF COPY'S GOOD, IT'S GOOD. >> THAT'S A CLIP FROM THE NEW\nAMAZON SERIES \"GOOD GIRLS REVOLT.\"\nIT'S FICTION BUT BASED ON THE REAL STORY OF 46 WOMEN WHO SUED\n\"NEWSWEEK\" FOR SEX DISCRIMINATION IN 1970.\nLYNN POVICH WAS ONE OF THOSE WOMEN, AND AUTHOR OF THE BOOK\nTHE NEW SERIES IS BASED ON. \"THE GOOD GIRLS REVOLT, HOW THE\nWOMEN OF NEWSWEEK SUED THEIR BOSSES AND CHANGED THE\nWORKPLACE.\" NICE TO HAVE YOU HERE.\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT SCENE, WHAT GOES THROUGH YOUR MIND?\n>> YOU KNOW, WE WERE TOLD STRAIGHT OUT IF YOU WANT TO\nWRITE GO SOME PLACE ELSE. WOMEN DON'T WRITE AT \"NEWSWEEK.\"\nSO PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO WRITE ACTUALLY LEFT VERY EARLY, WAY\nBEFORE THIS SERIES TAKES PLACE BECAUSE SHE KNEW SHE WANTED TO\nBE A WRITER AND WOULDN'T GET PROMOTED.\n>> BUT THERE WERE OTHER WOMEN IN THE NEWSROOM LIKE YOU WHO FOUGHT\nTHE GOOD FIGHT. BUT STILL, IT MUST HAVE TAKEN A\nLOT OF COURAGE TO LAUNCH THIS LAWSUIT AGAINST \"NEWSWEEK.\"\n>> IT DID. IT WAS ALSO A MATTER OF WHEN WE\nRO REALIZED IT WAS ILLEGAL.\nFOR SOME REASON FIVE YEARS AFTER THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT WE DIDN'T\nREALIZE IT WAS ILLEGAL TO SEGREGATE JOBS BY GENDER.\nI THINK THAT MOTIVATED A LOT OF US.\nIT'S NOT JUST BAD, IT'S ACTUALLY ILLEGAL.\nWE DID ORGANIZE AND HAD TO DO IT SECRETLY BECAUSE WE WERE AFRAID\nOF GETTING FIRED AT ANY MOMENT. >> EVEN IF THE LAWSUIT WAS\nSUCCESSFUL THERE'S A CHANCE YOU WOULD STILL LOSE YOUR JOB,\nRIGHT? >> THEY CAN'T FIRE YOU AFTER YOU\nFILE SUIT BUT THEY CAN CERTAINLY FREEZE YOU OUT.\nUNFORTUNATELY, IT HAPPENED TO TOO MANY WOMEN.\n>> WE WERE LOOKING AT PICTURES OF YOU FROM WHEN YOU WORKED\nTHERE. YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS READING\nABOUT THIS AND WATCHING PARTS OF THE NEW SERIES, IT BROUGHT ME\nBACK TO 1983 WHEN I STARTED MY CAREER.\nI STARTED IN A TINY TOWN IN OHIO.\nI THINK I WAS THE FIRST FEMALE ANCHOR THAT STATION EVER HAD AND\nOF COURSE, I WAS ON THE WEEKENDS AND I ALSO HAD TO DO THE WEATHER\nAND I ALSO PRODUCED THE NEWSCAST AND I WAS VERY LOW PAID.\nI THINK THAT WOMEN STILL SUFFER FROM LOWER WAGES THAN MEN EVEN\nTODAY, AND THAT'S SOMETHING DIFFICULT FOR YOUNGER WOMEN TO\nFATHOM. >> IT IS.\nWOMEN ARE STILL LEARNING HOW TO NEGOTIATE FOR THEMSELVES BECAUSE\nTHEY ARE PENALIZED IF THEY ARE TOO TOUGH, THEY ARE PENALIZED.\nIF THEY GO IN WITH LOWER SALARIES IT AFFECTS THEIR SALARY\nFOR THE REST OF THEIR LIFE. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO LEARN\nHOW TO NEGOTIATE. >> LET'S TALK A LITTLE ABOUT\nHISTORY. HILLARY CLINTON IS THE FIRST\nWOMAN WHO WAS NOMINATED BY A MAJOR PARTY IN THE UNITED STATES\nAND YOU DO HEAR A LOT OF WOMEN SAY WE ARE GLAD THAT A WOMAN WAS\nNOMINATED BUT WHY DID IT HAVE TO BE THIS WOMAN.\n>> WELL, YOU KNOW, I THINK IN HILLARY'S DEFENSE, HILLARY HAS\nFOUGHT FOR THE ISSUES THAT WOMEN REALLY CARE ABOUT FOR A LONG\nTIME. JOE BIDEN SAID WHEN SHE WAS EVEN\nBEFORE PUBLIC OFFICE, SHE WAS WORKING ON WOMEN'S ISSUES, ON\nFAMILY ISSUES, ON REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES AND ALL THE THINGS THAT\nMANY OF US CARE A LOT ABOUT, AND THAT ARE NEVER RAISED IN\nPRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS. SO I GIVE HER A LOT OF CREDIT.\nI THINK OBAMA WAS RIGHT WHEN HE SAID SHE'S THE MOST QUALIFIED\nPERSON IN THE RACE. >> SOME OF THE NAMES SHE'S BEING\nCALLED, SHE'S BEING CALLED A CROOK, A LOT OF PEOPLE CHANT\n\"LOCK HER UP\" AND I THINK THAT MORE WOMEN DON'T ENTER THE WORLD\nOF POLITICS BECAUSE THEY DON'T REALLY WANT TO DEAL WITH THAT.\n>> YEAH. IT'S STILL A PROBLEM FOR WOMEN\nAND WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT SEXUAL ASSAULT WOULD DOMINATE\nOUR CONVERSATION IN A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION?\nSO ON THE ONE HAND, IT'S HORRIBLE AND HORRIFYING TO SEE\nTHAT IT STILL EXISTS. ON THE OTHER HAND, I DO THINK\nTHE SILVER LINING IS THIS MADE A LOT OF WOMEN MAD, PARTICULARLY\nYOUNGER WOMEN WHO MAY NOT HAVE WANTED TO BE CALLED FEMINISTS.\nTHEY GET IT. THEY ARE REALLY ANGRY NOW.\n>> SO IF THIS ELECTION DOES BOIL DOWN TO WOMEN VERSUS MEN AND\nWOMEN VOTERS REALLY DO DECIDE THE ELECTION, WHAT DOES THAT SAY\nABOUT WOMEN IN AMERICA? >> I THINK IT'S NOT JUST WOMEN\nVERSUS MEN. I THINK A LOT OF MEN WILL VOTE\nFOR HILLARY AS WELL. CERTAINLY DONALD TRUMP HAS SOME\nWOMEN SUPPORTERS. BUT I THINK FOR THE WHOLE\nCOUNTRY, WE ARE AT A VERY DIVISIVE POINT BETWEEN WHETHER\nYOU CALL THEM REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS OR MEN AND WOMEN, IT'S\nA VERY VOLATILE TIME. BUT YOU KNOW, I HAVE MY\nCONFIDENCE IN THE YOUNGER GENERATION AND I THINK YOUNGER\nMEN ACTUALLY GET IT AND WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN RAISING THEIR\nCHILDREN AND HAVE HAD NOT ONLY SISTERS BUT CO-ED ROOMMATES.\nI THINK THIS GENERATION OF MEN IS GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.\n>> LYNN POVICH, THANK YOU SO MUCH.\nAPPRECIATE YOU BEING WITH ME.",

WHAT DOES \"HAPPY DAYS\" HAVE TO\nDO WITH OUR MOST IMPORTANT NUMBER OF THE DAY?\nOUR IMPORTANT NUMBER OF THE DAY IS 72 AND IT COMES FROM A SURVEY\nTHAT HIGHLIGHTS ONE OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN\nDONALD TRUMP SUPPORTERS AND HILLARY CLINTON SUPPORTERS.\nIT ALSO HAS TO DO WITH THAT SLOGAN DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN\nSPOUTING FOR HIS WHOLE CAMPAIGN, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE ASKED, OKAY, WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT?\nWHEN WASN'T AMERICA GREAT? HERE'S AN ANSWER.\nIT HAS TO DO WITH THE 1950s. 72% OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS IN A NEW\nPOLL SAY THAT AMERICAN LIFE AND CULTURE HAS BEEN IN DECLINE\nSINCE THE 1950s. IT HAS GOTTEN WORSE.\nNOW, IF YOU THINK ABOUT THIS, DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTERS, THINK\nABOUT SOME OF THE CHARACTERISTICS WE KNOW ABOUT\nTHEM. WE KNOW THEY TEND TO BE A LITTLE\nBIT OLDER, SO A LOT OF TRUMP  SUPPORTERS WERE AROUND BACK IN\nTHE 1950s. FOR MANY IT WAS THEIR FORMATIVE\nYEARS. SOME PROBABLY HAVE WONDERFUL\nMEMORIES OF GROWING UP IN THE 1950s.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD ASSOCIATE THE 1950s WITH THAT POST-WAR\nBOOM, THERE WERE ALL SORTS OF NEW POSSIBILITIES, ALL SORTS OF\nNEW THINGS HAPPENING. THERE IS NOSTALGIA, MAYBE, FOR\nTRUMP SUPPORTERS. AND WHAT FOLLOWED WAS THE\nUPHEAVAL OF THE 1960s. IF YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER SIDE OF\nTHIS, 70% OF CLINTON SUPPORTERS SAY CULTURE HAS GOTTEN BETTER\nSINCE THE 1950s. WE KNOW CLINTON SUPPORTERS TEND\nTO BE YOUNGER, FIRST OF ALL, SO A LOT OF THEM DON'T HAVE\nFIRSTHAND MEMORIES OF THE 1950s. WE ALSO KNOW HILLARY CLINTON\nSUPPORTERS TEND TO BE RACIALLY AND ETHNICALLY DIVERSE MORE THAN\nTRUMP SUPPORTERS, AND WE DIDN'T HAVE A CIVIL RIGHTS ACT IN THIS\nCOUNTRY, THERE WAS STILL SEGREGATION IN THE SOUTH.\nYOU MIGHT REMEMBER, YOU MIGHT THINK OF, YOU MIGHT ASSOCIATE\nTHE 1950s WITH SOME VERY DIFFERENT MEMORIES, SOME VERY\nDIFFERENT NEWS ELEMENTS THAN A TRUMP SUPPORTER WOULD.\nSO THAT SLOGAN, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.\nTRUMP SUPPORTERS THINK THE '50s WERE GREAT, CLINTON SUPPORTERS\nNOT AS MUCH.",
