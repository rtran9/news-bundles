ALSO THE LARGEST DROP IN THE\nNUMBER OF AMERICANS LIVING IN POVERTY SINCE THE 1960s.\nTHESE ECONOMIC NUMBERS LIKE THESE -- ON THESE ISSUES,\nTHEY'RE SO MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN JUST THE STATE OF THE STOCK\nMARKET OR THE OVERALL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE BUT ACTUALLY,\nOH, BY THE WAY, THOSE ARE PRETTY GOOD NOW, TOO.\nCOMBINE THAT WITH THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA'S OWN APPROVAL\nRATING RIGHT NOW IS AT 58%. IT'S AS HIGH AS IT'S BEEN SINCE\nAFTER HE WAS SWORN IN.

AS IVANKA AND MR. TRUMP NOTED\nLAST NIGHT THE WAY THAT OUR TAX CODE WAS SET UP TO DEAL WITH\nCHILD CARE IS ALMOST 60 YEARS OLD, RIGHT?\nTHE MODERN WORK FORCE ISN'T DAD GOES TO WORK AND MOM SITS HOME.\nYOU NOW HAVE TWO WORKING PARENTS IN MOST CASES AND A LOT OF TIMES\nTHE WIFE BEING THE BREADWINNER. CHILD CARE IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST\nEXPENSES THAT FAMILIES HAVE TO DEAL WITH.\nI THINK WHAT WAS OUTLINED LAST NIGHT WAS A REALLY BOLD, FRESH\nPLAN THAT RECOGNIZES THE MODERN WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN NOW.\nTHAT ALLOW MIDDLE CLASS AND LOW-INCOME FAMILIES TO ADDRESS\nONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS THAT FAMILIES FACE.\nHOW TO PAY FOR CHILD CARE. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS\nREALLY INTERESTING ABOUT IT WAS THAT IT WASN'T JUST ABOUT CHILD\nCARE. IT TALKED ABOUT DEPENDENT CARE\nAND ELDER CARE, AS WELL AND RECOGNIZED THAT THE WORLD THAT\nWE LIVE IN NOW, SOMETIMES, IT'S A SICK INDIVIDUAL OR A FAMILY\nMEMBER, BUT IT'S ALSO MOM AND DAD NOW POTENTIALLY MOVING BACK\nIN, BECAUSE THEY NEED TO BE CARED FOR IN A LOT OF CASES.\nSO THE TAX CODE DOESN'T RECOGNIZE THAT ASPECT OF HOW WE\nLIVE OUR LIVES KNOW. AND IT ENSURES THAT WE HAVE THE\nABILITY TO CARE FOR OUR ELDER PARENTS OR FAMILY MEMBERS THAT\nNEED CARE. >> DEMOCRATS SAY THAT'S WHAT\nWE'VE BEEN TELLING YOU GUYS FOR TEN YEARS.\nCAN TRUMP GET HIS OWN PARTY -- >> NO, NO.\nBUT I THINK THE DIFFERENCE IS THE DEMOCRATS TALK ABOUT\nGOVERNMENT PROVIDING EVERYTHING. I THINK WHAT YOU SAW LAST NIGHT\nWAS A REALLY BOLD, FRESH, INNOVATIVE WAY OF ENSURING THAT\nIT'S PAID FOR, AND THAT -- AND THAT IT RECOGNIZES THE DIFFERENT\nFACETS OF HOW -- >> WHAT'S INNOVATIVE ABOUT HOW\nIT'S PAID FOR. HE SAID I'LL PAY FOR IT BY\nFINDING WASTE AND FRAUD AND ABUSE.\n>> LOOKING AT THAT UNEMPLOYMENT ASPECT OF IT.\nTHE DEMOCRATS JUST WANT TO ADD UP NEW SPENDING.\nI THINK THE DIFFERENCE IS WHAT TRUMP DID LAST NIGHT WAS MADE\nSURE THAT HE HAD A MECHANISM TO ADDRESS HOW TO PAY FOR IT.\n>> HE SAID I'LL FIND WASTE, FRAUD AND ABUSE.\n>> RIGHT. >> STEVE SAID HE'S NEVER SEEN\nTHAT WORK -- >> THAT'S THE PROBLEM.\nWHAT TRUMP IS TALKING ABOUT OVERALL IS SAYING WE'RE NOT\nGOING TO HAVE BUSINESS AS USUAL. WE'RE GOING TO GO TO WASHINGTON,\nWE'RE GOING TO MAKE CHANGE, AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO SETTLE FOR\nTHE STATUS QUO. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE STATE OF\nPLAY. HILLARY CLINTON SAYS 50% OF\nTRUMP SUPPORTERS ARE IN THE BASKET OF DEPLORABLES.\n>> RIGHT. AND THE OTHER 50% ARE DESPERATE.\nI MEAN LET'S NOT FORGET THAT. IT'S NOT JUST THAT 50% ARE\nDEPLORABLE. IT'S THAT IF YOU'RE NOT\nDEPLORABLE YOU'VE GOT TO BE DESPERATE.\n>> TRUMP PLAYS TO ADVANTAGE AND SAYS LOOK AT THE WAY SHE TALKS\nABOUT YOU HARD-WORKING AMERICAN. YOU CAN'T BE PRESIDENT WHEN YOU\nTALK LIKE THAT. WHEN HE SAYS HILLARY CLINTON HAS\nA HATE-FILLED CAMPAIGN A HYPOCRISY FLAG POPS UP AND\nSTARTS WAVING BACK AND FORTH. WHO IS DONALD TRUMP TO SAY THAT\nANYBODY IS A HATE FILLED CAMPAIGN WITH ALL THAT HE HAS\nSAID. >> LOOK, FIRST OF ALL, EVERY\nTIME THAT DONALD TRUMP OPENS HIS MOUTH HILLARY CLINTON AND EVERY\nOTHER DEMOCRATIC SUPPORTER AND COMMENTATOR GOES OFF ON DONALD\nTRUMP. SO HE CAN'T SAY THIS.\nWHEN HILLARY CLINTON DOES IT IT'S ALMOST LIKE IN A LOT OF\nCASES SHE GETS A PASS AND EVERYONE TRIES TO EXPLAIN WHAT\nSHE REALLY MEANT. THE REALITY IS, THIS ACHBS\nINSIGHT INTO WHAT SHE THINKS, NOT ABOUT ONE CANDIDATE OR\nANOTHER. IT'S ONE THING FOR CANDIDATES TO\nGO BACK AND FORTH. YOU AND I HAVE SEEN THAT.\nCANDIDATES GO AT EACH OTHER. IT'S ONE THING TO DESCRIBE THE\nENTIRE DEGREE OF SUPPORT THAT YOU'RE EITHER THIS OR YOU'RE\nTHAT -- >> NO BUT SHE DIDN'T --\n>> NO, NO, SHE DIDN'T. >> SHE SAID 50%, SHE THEN SAID\nTHAT WAS A MISTAKE AND SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT A SMALL NUMBER OF\nTHE ALT-RIGHT PEOPLE -- >> NO, NO, STOP.\n>> THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID -- >> LET'S TALK WHAT SHE LITERALLY\nSAID. SHE SAID DEPLORABLE HALF OF\nWHICH ARE RACIST, SEXIST -- >> SHE SAID HALF WAS TOO MUCH.\n>> AND THE OTHER HALF, AND THEN SHE SAID AND THE OTHER HALF WERE\nDESPERATE. OKAY.\nAND THEN SHE CAME BACK THE NEXT DAY AND SHE SAYS I REGRET USING\nTHE WORD HALF WHEN SPEAKING ABOUT DEPLORABLE.\nMEANING SHE STANDS BY THE FACT THAT SOME, A GOOD WHATEVER\nMAJORITY ARE STILL THAT BUT SHE NEVER ADDRESSED THE OTHER HALF.\n>> SO -- >> SHE NEVER ADDRESSED THAT\nSAYING THAT THE OTHER HALF ARE DESPERATE.\n>> UNDERSTOOD AND THAT'S A POINT FOR CRITICISM FOR HER.\nBUT HOW DO YOU SET THAT UP AGAINST THIS? >>> WHEN MEXICO SENDS ITS\nPEOPLE, THEY'RE NOT SENDING THEIR BEST.\nTHEY'RE BRINGING DRUGS, THEY'RE",

HERE WHAT HE SAID, PLUS YOU KNOW\nIT'S 2016 WHEN DR. OZ WILL BE HOSTING DONALD TRUMP TO TALK\nABOUT THE CANDIDATE'S MEDICAL RESULTS ON TELEVISION.\nWE'VE GOT ALL THAT FOR YOU. >>> NOVEMBER 8.\nIT'S OFFICIALLY LESS THAN TWO MONTHS TO GO.\nTHERE ARE STILL SERIOUS QUESTIONS ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL\nFOR BOTH HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP AND IT COMES DOWN\nTO TRANSPARENCY. FOR DONALD TRUMP IT'S HIS TAXES,\nHIS MEDICAL RECORDS, HIS FOUNDATION.\nFOR HILLARY CLINTON IT'S HER HEALTH, WHAT HER CAMPAIGN\nDECIDES TO RELEASE AND WHEN AND SOME QUESTIONS ON HER FOUNDATION\nAND THE E-MAILS. BACK IN THE HEADLINES TODAY, THE\nE-MAILS BECAUSE THIS ISSUE IS FRONT AND CENTER AGAIN IN\nCONGRESS, LET'S GO TO CNN'S SENIOR POLITICAL REPORTER MANU\nRAJU ON THE HILL FOR US. HOUSE REPUBLICANS NOT HAPPY WITH\nHOW THE HEARING WENT TODAY STARTING WITH -- TALK TO ME,\nM MANU, ABOUT THE NO SHOW.\n>> THAT'S RIGHT, BRIAN PAGLIANO, ONE OF TWO CLINTON AIDES WHO\nHELPED SET UP THAT PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER IN 2009 DIDN'T\nSHOW UP AT THE HEARING TODAY EVEN THOUGH HE WAS SUBPOENAED BY\nTHE HOUSE OVERSIGHT AND GOVERNMENT REFORM COMMITTEE TO\nSHOW UP AND TESTIFY. THIS IS THE SECOND TIME HE HAS\nINVOKED HIS FIFTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS NOT TO DISCUSS ANYTHING\nABOUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME HE DIDN'T\nSHOW UP AND HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN JASON\nCHAFFETZ, THE REPUBLICAN OF UTAH, WAS FURIOUS ABOUT THIS.\nHE SAID THAT IT'S NOT OPTIONAL. THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE SUBPOENA\nHAVE HAD TO SHOW UP AND THE COMMITTEE WOULD LOOK AT \"ALL\nOPTIONS\" IN ITS RECOURSE IN GOING AFTER MR. PAGLIANO.\nNOW DEMOCRATS SAY THE REASON WHY HE DIDN'T SHOW UP ACCORDING TO\nMR. PAGLIANO'S LAWYER IS THAT THEY BELIEVE IT'S A PARTISAN\nWITCH-HUNT AND THEY BELIEVE IT SERVES NO LEGISLATIVE PURPOSE\nAND THEY SAY THE AGREEMENT THAT MR. PAGLIANO REACHED WITH THE\nFBI FOR LIMITED IMMUNITY GIVES HIM PROTECTION IN NOT TO SHOW\nUP. ONE PERSON WHO DID SHOW UP WAS\nJUSTIN COOPER, ANOTHER CLINTON AIDE WHO SET UP THE PRIVATE\nE-MAIL SERVER, HE DIDN'T GIVE REPUBLICANS MUCH EXCEPT FOR\nTHIS, HE ADMITTED HE DIDN'T HAVE A SECURITY CLEARANCE WHEN\nSETTING UP THE PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER.\nAS WE KNOW, REPUBLICANS HAVE CRITICIZED CLINTON FOR PASSING\nON CLASSIFIED MARKED E-MAILS THAT WERE NOT SECURE SO CER\nCERTAINLY MORE FODDER FOR REPUBLICANS AS THEY TRY TO KEEP\nTHE ISSUE ALIVE. >> MANU RAJU ON THE HILL FOR US,\nWE'LL TALK MONEY NOW. THE SUPER PAC ALIGNED WITH HOUSE\nSPEAKER PAUL RYAN HAS TAKEN IN A RECORD-BREAKING HAUL THIS\nELECTION SEASON. THE REASON, REPUBLICAN DONORS\nWHO NORMALLY FOCUS THEIR CASH AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET ARE\nWORRIED ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AT THE TOP AND WANT TO MAKE SURE\nSPEAKER RYAN HANGS ON TO HIS GAVEL SO THEY'RE SENDING THEIR\nMONEY TO WHAT THEY HOPE WILL BE A REPUBLICAN FIREWALL I BELIEVE\nWAS THE WORD USED. JOINING US, A. B. STODDARD FROM\nREAL CLEAR POLITICS. LET ME GO TO PAUL RYAN AND\nMAKING SURE THE REPUBLICANS HANG ON TO THE MAJORITY.\nARE THERE WORRIES THAT THE REPUBLICANS COMING FORWARD DOING\nTHAT WOULD THEN SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP?\nWHAT'S YOUR READ ON THIS? >> WELL, PEOPLE WHO ARE WORRIED\nABOUT THE SENATE RACES AND TRYING TO PRESERVE THE SENATE\nMAJORITY FOR REPUBLICANS AND TRYING TO ACTIVELY SEARCH THE\nCOUNTRY FOR THE RESOURCES TO FUND THESE CAMPAIGNS ARE NOT\nCERTAIN WHAT THE TURNOUT MODEL WILL BE IN TERMS OF WHETHER\nTRUMP VOTERS TURN OUT FOR THESE CANDIDATES, WHETHER SOME\nDEMOCRATS VOTE FOR CLINTON AND INDEPENDENT VOTERS VOTE FOR\nTHOSE REPUBLICANS, EACH STATE IS DIFFERENT AS YOU KNOW.\nIN OHIO ROB PORTMAN IS RUNNING WAY AHEAD OF HIS DEMOCRATIC\nCHALLENGER. GOVERNOR KASICH IS NOT A BIG\nFRIEND OF DONALD TRUMP'S AND HIS REPUBLICAN MACHINE HAS REALLY\nACTIVELY BEEN WORKING TO HELP ROB PORTMAN WHO ALSO HAS JUST\nONE A REALLY, REALLY TERRIFIC CAMPAIGN FOCUSING ON ISSUESOVER\nIMPORTANCE TO OHIOANS AND NOT NATIONAL ISSUES AND TRYING TO\nAVOID THE NATIONAL DEBATE.

BUT I WOULD ALSO ADD THAT I\nTHINK THE REASON PRESIDENT OBAMA AND FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON ARE\nOUT THERE TRYING TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT SHE'S SORT OF THIS,\nSHE'S ANOTHER FOUR YEARS OF OBAMA, IS THAT THEY ARE WORRIED\nABOUT THE ENTHUSIASM FACTOR AND WORRIED A LOT OF DEMOCRATIC\nVOTERS WON'T TURN OUT. IF THEY THINK SHE'S IN SOME WAY\nCOMPROMISED OR IN SOME WAY IS A WEAKER CANDIDATE BECAUSE OF HER\nHEALTH, THAT THAT WILL BE A FURTHER EXACERBATION OF THE\nPROBLEM. I THINK THEY HAVE TO REMIND THE\nDEMOCRATIC BASE THAT IF YOU LIKE WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING, YOU HAVE\nTO TURN OUT IN NOVEMBER AND HELP RE-ELECT A DEMOCRAT.\n>> ALL RIGHT, GUYS, I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nTHE FAST-MOVING DEVELOPMENTS OUT OF THE FORMER DNC CHAIR CALLING\nFOR, JUST IN CASE, A HILLARY CONTINGENCY PLAN.\nIT WOULD BE UNPRECEDENTED TERRITORY WATCHING EXAMINERS\nTHERE. SARAH, WHAT ARE THEY TALKING\nABOUT? >> OBVIOUSLY HILLARY CLINTON'S\nHEALTH CONCERNS ARE RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER SHE CAN\nMAKE IT ALL THE WAY TO NOVEMBER. AND OBVIOUSLY THAT IS A REALLY\nUNLIKELY SCENARIO. THE DNC DOESN'T HAVE A MECHANISM\nTO FORCE HER OFF THE TICKET SO SHE WOULD HAVE TO STEP ASIDE\nVOLUNTARILY. IF SHE DID DO THAT, THEN THE DNC\nCHAIR NOW DONNA BRAZIL WOULD CALL A SPECIAL MEETING TO SELECT\nA NOMINEE WITH A MAJORITY VOTE OF ATTENDEES AT THAT MEETING,\nTHE DNC DOES NOT HAVE TO RECONVENE THE CONVENTION.\nSO TIM KAINE WOULD NOT AUTOMATICALLY BECOME THE\nPRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE. IF SOMEBODY ELSE WAS SELECTED\nLIKE JOE BIDEN OR BERNIE SANDERS, TIM KAINE WOULD STAY ON\nAS THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.\n>> ALL BETS WOULD BE OFF IF SOMETHING WERE TO JEOPARDIZE THE\nHEALTH OF THE CANDIDATE THEN AFTER THE ELECTION IT WOULD BE\nTHE RUNNING MATE OR THE VICE PRESIDENT TO MOVE UP.\nWE MENTIONED THE SUBJECT BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT BEEN HERE SINCE 1972\nWHEN GEORGE McGOVERN WITH HIS RUNNING MATE AND THE CONTROVERSY\nTHAT DEVELOPED AROUND SHOCK TREATMENTS.\nSENATOR TOM EAGLETON SWITCHED HIM OUT AND WENT WITH SERGEANT\nSHRIVER, BUT THAT'S THE CLOSEST I CAN SEE WHERE WE HAD A\nSITUATION WHERE THEY HAD TO CHANGE SOMETHING AFTER\nCONVENTION. >> RIGHT.\nTHIS IS TOTALLY UNCHARTERED TERRITORY FOR THE DEMOCRATIC\nPARTY. AND IT WOULD BE A REAL MESS,\nBECAUSE AS YOU KNOW, EARLY VOTING IS MUCH MORE PERVASIVE\nNOW. EARLY VOTING ALREADY STARTED IN\nNORTH CAROLINA AND WILL START IN ALABAMA LATER THIS WEEK.\nMILITARY AND OVERSEAS VOTES ARE MAILED 45 DAYS BEFORE THE\nELECTION. THAT'S TEN DAYS FROM NOW.\nAND OBVIOUSLY THE STATE BALLOTS ARE CLOSE TO GETTING A NEW NAME\nON THE BALLOT. SO IT WOULD BE A LOGISTICAL\nNIGHTMARE FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.\n>> DO THEY HAVE EITHER PARTY A PROCEDURE IN PLACE IF THE MAIN\nCANDIDATE FALLS ILL? WE CERTAINLY HAVE HEARD OF\nPRESIDENTS FALLEN WITH SECONDS OF TAKING OFFICE.\nA COUPLE NAMES COME TO MIND, EITHER WITH A LONG SPEECH,\nWITHOUT AN OVERCOAT, I DIGRESS TO MAKE THE POINT WE HAVE SEEN\nTHIS EARLY ON IN THE ADMINISTRATION, BUT I DON'T\nTHINK WE'RE PREPARED AS A COUNTRY OR THE PARTY IS FOR THE\nPOSSIBILITY THAT THEIR NOMINEE BECOMES A BIG HEALTH QUESTION\nMARK. >> EXACTLY.\nTHAT'S WHY YOU SAW FORMER DNC CHAIR DAN FOULER SAYING WE NEED\nTO HAMMER THIS OUT NOW ON THE VERY REMOTE POSSIBILITY\nSOMETHING DOES HAPPEN TO HILLARY CLINTON.\nWE DON'T WANT TO BE LEFT WITH NO OPTIONS AND JUST CEDING THE\nPRESIDENCY TO DONALD TRUMP. SO DEMOCRATS ARE STARTING TO\nHAVE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW THIS WOULD WORK.\nIF MOVING PIECES ACROSS 50 STATES IS NECESSARY, BUT\nOBVIOUSLY THIS WOULD BE THE WORST SAYS SCENARIO FOR\nDEMOCRATS. >> WHEN YOU HAVE TWO CANDIDATES\nAROUND 69 TO 70 YEARS OLD, MAYBE IT ANSWERS THE QUESTION WE\nSHOULD BE ASKING MORE REGARDLESS OF THE TREATIES OF THEIR HEALTH\nBEING FINE.

              "text": "ANNOUNCING SHE'LL RETURN TO THE\nCAMPAIGN TRAIL ON THURSDAY AFTER TAKING THREE DAYS OFF TO RECOVER\nFROM HER WELL PUBLICIZED BOUT WITH PNEUMONIA.\nPOLICE HAVE ARRESTED A MAN ACCUSED OF HITTING SEVERAL\nANTI-TRUMP PROTESTERS DURING A DONALD TRUMP RALLY LAST NIGHT.\nTHEY ALSO ISSUED A WARRANT FOR A DIFFERENT MAN WHO IS ACCUSED OF\nPUNCHING WHAT LOCAL NEWS REPORTS IDENTIFIED AS A 69-YEAR-OLD\nWOMAN OUTSIDE THE RALLY. SHE TOLD A REPORTER SHE WAS\nTHERE PROTESTING TRUMP AS WELL AND APPEARS IN THE PHOTO TO BE\nWEARING AN OXYGEN MASK. AFTER A WHIRLWIND FEW DAYS\nFOCUSED ON HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH AND DONALD TRUMP'S\nDEPLORABLES TODAY BROUGHT THE SINGLE-MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF\nELECTION NEWS THIS WEEK, POSSIBLY THE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN AND\nFOR ONCE THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH EITHER CANDIDATE.\nU.S. CENSUS BUREAU ANNOUNCING THAT REAL MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD\nINCOME INCREASED 5.2% UP TO $56,516.\nIT'S THE FIRST INCREASE IN HOUSEHOLD INCOME SINCE 2007\nBEFORE THE GREAT RECESSION, THE FASTEST GROWTH ON RECORD SINCE\nTHE CENSUS BUREAU STARTED KEEPING TRACK ALMOST -- MORE\nTHAN 40 YEARS AGO. THESE AREN'T JUST NUMBERS.\nTHEY MAKE A REAL DINS. THE AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD EARNED\nNEARLY $2800 MORE LAST YEAR THAN IT DID THE YEAR BEFORE.\nAND IF YOU CAN DISTILL THE TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN'S MESSAGE DOWN\nTO A SINGLE IDEA -- AMERICA IS A DISASTER, EVERYTHING IS\nTERRIBLE, HILLARY CLINTON WILL ONLY MAKE IT WORSE AND YOU MUST\nVOTE FOR TRUMP BECAUSE, AND I'M QUOTING, I ALONE CAN FIX IT.\n>> AND THINK OF THIS, MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME HAS FALLEN BY\nMORE THAN $4,000. $4,000.\nWE HAVE PEOPLE STANDING IN THIS ROOM WHO MADE MORE MONEY IN REAL\nWAGES 18 YEARS AGO THAN THEY'RE MAKING TODAY.\nTHEY DIDN'T WORK AS HARD. THEY WERE A HELL OF A LOT\nYOUNGER. IT SHOULD BE THE OTHER WAY\nAROUND. AND WE LOST OUR JOBS, WE LOST\nOUR COMPANIES, AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET IT HAPPEN ANYMORE.\nWE'RE GOING TO GET OUR JOBS BACK.\nWE'RE GOING TO BRING OUR COMPANIES BACK.\n>> TODAY'S NEWS, AND MORE SPECIFICALLY AND IMPORTANTLY,\nTHE REALITY REFLECTS UNDERCUTS TRUMP'S DOOM AND GLOOM MESSAGE.\nWHILE CLINTON WASN'T ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL TODAY TO POINT\nTHAT OUT, SHE HAPPENED TO HAVE THE PERFECT SURROGATE OUT THERE\nMAKING THE CASE THE ECONOMY IS THRIVING.\nTHE TIME HAD COME FOR HIM TO PASS HER THE BATON.\n>> REPUBLICANS DON'T LIKE TO HEAR GOOD NEWS RIGHT NOW, BUT\nIT'S IMPORTANT JUST TO UNDERSTAND IS A BIG DEAL.\nMORE AMERICANS ARE WORKING. MORE HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE.\nINCOMES ARE RISING. POVERTY IS FALLING.\nAND GAS IS $2 A GALLON. I DIDN'T EVEN -- THANK YOU FOR\nREMINDING ME. THANKS, OBAMA.\n>> CRUCIALLY THE ECONOMIC GAINS WE'RE SEEING AREN'T JUST GOING\nTO PEOPLE AT THE TOP OF THE ECONOMIC SPECTRUM WHICH HAS BEEN\nTHE CASE FOR MOST OF THE RECOVERY.\nIT WAS THE LOWEST EARNING AMERICANS ON THE LEFT WHO ARE\nSEEING THE BIGGEST GROWTH IN PERCENTAGE TERMS IN THEIR REAL\nHOUSEHOLD INCOME. IN A SPEECH TODAY, THE PRESIDENT\nDIDN'T JUST MAKE A CASE FOR CLINTON AND CONTINUED DEMOCRATIC\nPARTY POLICIES, HE ALSO MOCKED TRUMP FOR CASTING HIMSELF AS A\nCHAMPION OF THE WORKING CLASS. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT MR. TRUMP.\nHE'S NOT REALLY A PLANS GUY, A FACT GUY.\nHE CALLS HIMSELF A BUSINESS GUY. BUT AMERICA'S GOT A LOT OF\nBUSINESSMEN AND WOMEN WHO SUCCEEDED WITHOUT HIDING THEIR\nTAX RETURNS OR LEAVING A TRAIL OF LAWSUITS OR WORKERS WHO\nDIDN'T GET PAID. PEOPLE FEELING LIKE THEY GOT\nCHEATED. I MEAN, LOOK, YOU KNOW, I KEEP\nON READING THIS ANALYSIS THAT, WELL, YOU KNOW, TRUMP'S GOT\nSUPPORT FROM LIKE WORKING FOLKS. REALLY?\nLIKE THIS IS THE GUY YOU WANT TO BE CHAMPIONING WORKING PEOPLE?\nTHIS GUY WHO SPENT 70 YEARS ON THIS EARTH SHOWING NO CONCERN\nFOR WORKING PEOPLE. THIS GUY'S SUDDENLY GOING TO BE\nYOUR CHAMPION? I MEAN, HE SPENT MOST OF HIS\nLIFE TRYING TO STAY AS FAR AWAY FROM WORKING PEOPLE AS HE COULD.\nAND NOW THIS GUY'S GOING TO BE THE CHAMPION OF WORKING PEOPLE?\nI MEAN, HE WASN'T GOING TO LET YOU ON HIS GOLF COURSE.\nHE WASN'T GOING TO LET YOU BUY IN HIS CONDO.\nAND NOW SUDDENLY THIS GUY'S GOING TO BE YOUR CHAMPION?\n>> HERE WITH ME NOW MICHELLE GOLDBERG, A COLUMNIST FOR SLATE\nAND A REPORTER FOR \"THE NEW YORK TIMES.\"\nWE'VE GOT DONALD TRUMP MAKING A SPEECH TONIGHT ON POLICY.\nTHERE'S BEEN A REAL POLICY TURN FROM DONALD TRUMP WHICH HAS BEEN\nINTERESTING. HE WAS QUOTED BY SAYING IT'S\nJUST BUREAUCRATS PUTTING TOGETHER PAPER.\nIT DOESN'T MATTER. HOW KELLYANNE CONWAY SAYING\nSHE'S PROUD OF HOW POLICY FOCUSED THE CAMPAIGN IS.\nULTIMATELY THIS QUESTION IS DUE TO HOW MUCH OF THE FUNDAMENTALS\nMATTER. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR\nFUNDAMENTALS, THIS SAZ IMPORTANT AS FUNDAMENTALS NEWS GETS.\n>> THIS IS VERY GOOD NEWS TO WORKING FAMILIES.\nIT DOES UNDERCUT TRUMP. BUT THE GAINS IN THESE ARE NOT\nWILDLY -- ARE SOMEWHAT NARROW. RURAL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY,\nWHICH ARE TRUMP PARTS ARE NOT FEELING IT.\nTHINGS ARE NOT AS GOOD AS THEY WERE AT THE PEAK OF THE 1990s.\nTHE QUESTION IS WHO IS FEELING WHICH PART OF IT?\nWHO IS FEELING THE GOOD NEWS AND THE BAD NEWS AND HOW DO THEY\nVOTE? >> NOBODY CHANGES THEIR VOTE ON\nTHE BASIS OF THESE CENSUS FIGURES, RIGHT?\n>> NO, NO. >> SO IF YOUR OWN SITUATION\nFEELS VERY PRECARIOUS, YOU KNOW, AND YOU HAVE A LOT OF ANXIETY,\nMAYBE IT COULD EASE YOUR ANXIETY A LITTLE BIT BUT PEOPLE ARE\nBASING THESE THINGS ABOUT THEIR SITUATION AND THEIR NEIGHBOR'S\nSITUATION. SO THE KIND OF UNOFFICIAL SLOGAN\nOF A LOT OF THIS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN NOTHING MATTERS, RIGHT?\nAND PEOPLE SAY THAT EVERY TIME TRUMP SAYS SOMETHING THAT\nDOESN'T DISQUALIFY HIM PEOPLE SAY NOTHING MATTERS.\nTHIS IS THE TEST. WILL THIS PUNCTURE TRUMP'S\nMESSAGE OF KIND OF AMERICA IN FREEFALL?\nOR DOES TRULY NO EMPIRICAL FACT KIND OF PUNCTURE THE BUBBLE THAT\nHE AND HIS ARE LIVING IN? AND I THINK HE'S TRYING TO\nEXTEND INTO AS MANY SWING VOTERS AS POSSIBLE.\nI GUESS THAT'S WHAT MATTERS. >> THE QUESTION HERE, RIGHT, SO\nYOU HAVE THE PRESIDENT COMING OUT BEING -- FIRST OF ALL,\nYOU'VE ALSO GOT HILLARY CLINTON SORT OF ON THE BENCH BECAUSE OF\nTHE PNEUMONIA DIAGNOSIS, THEN YOU'VE GOT -- I THINK THE\nPRESIDENT WAS PRETTY HAPPY TO BE OUT ON THIS DAY WHEN THE NEWS\nCAME OUT. IT WAS SUFFUSED THROUGH HIS\nENTIRE BEARING. SOMEONE YELLED $2 GAS.\nIT REMINDED ME OF THE FACT THAT I WAS GOING BACK THROUGH DUMB\nLITTLE CAMPAIGN MICRO CONTROVERSIES, SOMEONE REMINDED\nME IN 2008 WHEN GAS WAS HIGH THAT YOU SHOULD CHECK THAT YOUR\nTIRES ARE FULLY INFLATED BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY REDUCES GAS MILEAGE.\nTHERE WAS A POINT WHEN JOHN McCAIN WAS HANDING OUT TIRE\nGAUGES. GAS WAS $4 A GALLON THEN.\nTHIS MESSAGE ABOUT WHO IS IN AND WHO IS OUT ULTIMATELY LOOKS LIKE\nTHE DEFINING FUNDAMENTAL STRUCTURAL PART OF THIS\nCAMPAIGN. WE'VE GOT POLLING OUT OF MAINE,\nWHICH IS NOT DOING VERY WELL, SAYING THAT THE RACE IS TIGHT.\nWE'VE GOT VIRGINIA AND COLORADO, STATES THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN\nSWING STATES THAT LOOK LIKE RUNAWAYS FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\n>> THERE ARE RIGHT-LEANING SWING STATES THAT ARE IN DOUBT FOR\nTRUMP AND LEFT-LEANING SWING STATES THAT ARE FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON. AND AS EVERYONE SAYS, THE SENSE\nOF SECURITY THE NEXT PAYCHECK, THE LAST, IS THE FUTURE GOING TO\nBE BETTER THAN THE PAST? THE REAL BIG SENSATIONS ON WHAT\nPEOPLE BASED A VOTE ON AND IT'S NOT THE GDP OR THE AVERAGE\nHOUSEHOLD INCOME. >> NOT JUST THE NEXT PAYCHECK,\nBECAUSE TRUMP VOTERS ARE ACTUALLY DOING PRETTY WELL AND\nDOING WELL RELATIVE TO VOTERS RELATIVE TO SANDERS VOTERS, BUT\nWHEN IN PUBLIC OPINION SURVEYS THEIR KIDS AREN'T DOING WELL,\nTHEIR COMMUNITIES ARE IN DISREPAIR.\nTHAT KIND OF DOESN'T CHANGE BECAUSE THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE\nIMPROVING. >> I WANT TO PLAY THIS BIT OF\nSOUND BECAUSE THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT CHILD CARE TONIGHT,\nMATERNITY LEAVE. THERE'S THE SOUND OF TRUMP\nTALKING ABOUT HOW HE VIEWS MEN AND WOMEN'S ROLES IN CARING FOR\nA BABY. I WANTED TO GET MICHELLE AND\nYOUR RESPONSE. >> YOU'RE GOING TO BE A NEW\nFATHER AGAIN IN THE NEAR FUTURE. >> I AM.\nI AM. >> DO YOU ACTUALLY CHANGE\nDIAPERS? >> NO, I DON'T DO THAT.\n>> NOT ONE, RIGHT? >> NO.\nI DON'T DO IT. IT'S NOT MY THING.\nI'M A GOOD FATHER, BUT THAT'S NOT MY THING.\n>> IT'S NOBODY'S THING. YEAH, BUT IT'S NO ONE'S THING.\n>> YEAH, BUT SOME WOMEN -- WELL, IT'S UP TO THE WOMEN.\nTHERE'S A LOT OF WOMEN OUT THERE THAT DEMAND THAT THE HUSBAND ACT\nLIKE THE WIFE AND, YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT OF HUSBANDS THAT\nLISTEN TO THAT. >> YOU HIRE ONE PERSON TO BE THE\nDIAPER CHANGER? >> NO, MELANIA IS GOING TO BE\nFANTASTIC. SHE'S GOING TO BE A FANTASTIC\nMOTHER. AND BY THE WAY, IF I HAD A\nDIFFERENT TYPE OF WIFE, I PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE A BABY.\nBECAUSE THAT'S JUST NOT MY THING.\nI'M REALLY LIKE A GREAT FATHER, BUT CERTAIN THINGS YOU DO AND\nCERTAIN THINGS YOU DON'T AND IT'S JUST NOT FOR ME.\n>> I THINK WE'VE SEEN THE FACT THAT IT'S INTERESTING, THIS IS\nNOT FAMILY LEAVE, THIS IS SPECIFICALLY MATERNITY LEAVE.\n>> THE PROBLEM WITH THE ECONOMY RIGHT NOW IS THAT IT'S ACTUALLY\nSET UP FOR FAMILIES WHO ARE KIND OF ARRANGED THEIR DUTIES THE WAY\nTHAT TRUMP DOES. >> DIVISION OF LABOR.\n>> AND WE LOOK AT THAT AND IT SEEMS LIKE SO INCREDIBLY RETRO,\nRIGHT? IT'S ALMOST KIND OF KITSCH, WHAT\nA CHAUVINIST HE IS. EVEN IF IT'S TRUMP, FINE.\nTRUMP HAS INCREDIBLY RETROGRADE IDEAS ABOUT WOMEN IN HIS\nPERSONAL LIFE. TO ME, HE'S INCREDIBLY\nRETROGRADE ABOUT WORKING WOMEN IN HIS PUBLIC LIFE.\nNONE OF US WILL REMEMBER HOW DISGUSTING HE FOUND IT WHEN\nSOMEBODY WAS PUMPING BREASTMILK DURING A DEPOSITION.\nTHIS IS SOMEONE WHO IS HOSTILE TO WOMEN WHEN HE HAS TO WORK\nWITH THEM, WORKING MOTHERS. >> TAKE A LOOK AS DONALD TRUMP\nCONTINUES TO LAY OUT HIS POLICY AGENDA IN THIS AREA.\nTAKE A LISTEN. >> THIS SOLUTION WILL RECEIVE\nSTRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. DO YOU AGREE WITH IT?\nDO YOU THINK? WHEN YOU GO TO THE OTHER SIDE,\nTHEY'LL BE OK? I'M HEARING THEY WILL BE.\nWE'LL GET THEM TO BE OKAY, RIGHT?\nAND WE'LL BE COMPLETELY SELF-FINANCING.\nI THINK YOU WILL. YOU'LL HAVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT.\nBY RECAPTURING FRAUD AND IMPROPER PAYMENTS IN THE\nUNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM, WE CAN PROVIDE SIX WEEKS OF PAID\nMATERNITY LEAVE TO ANY MOTHER WITH A NEWBORN CHILD WHOSE\nEMPLOYER DOES NOT PROVIDE THE BENEFIT.\n>> JOINING ME NOW, BETSY STEVENSON, FORMER MEMBER OF\nPRESIDENT OBAMA'S COUNCIL. WE WERE LUCKY TO GET THE\nSOUNDBITE, LIVE, WHEN WE WENT TO IT.\nTHAT'S THE TWEET-LENGTH VERSION OF THIS POLICY.\nYOU KNOW, MY FIRST THOUGHT WHEN I WOKE UP THIS MORNING AND SAW\nTHEY WERE ROLLING THIS OUT, WE HAVE BIPARTISAN CONTENDERS ON\nMATERNITY LEAVE. WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHTS?\n>> I DO THINK WE'RE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.\nTHIS IS A REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE STANDING UP AND SAYING WE'RE\nGOING TO NEED TO PROVIDE SOME FORM OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE.\nUNFORTUNATELY, I THINK HE'S PROPOSING THE POLICY THAT MAYBE\nWE SHOULD HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT 30 OR 40 YEARS AGO.\nBUT TODAY WE ACTUALLY IN MANY FAMILIES IF NOT MOST FAMILIES\nHAVE BOTH MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE ACTIVE CARE-TAKERS SO PROVIDING\nA POLICY FOR PAID MATERNITY LEAVE WITHOUT ANY PLAN FOR\nFATHERS TO TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE AND TO BE ABLE TO TAKE TIME OFF\nTO DO THAT IS REALLY ABSURD IN 2016.\nHE WON'T GET BIPARTISAN SUPPORT ON THAT.\n>> I WANT TO STOP YOU THERE. BECAUSE THERE'S A DISTINCTION.\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS A PAID LEAVE PORTION TO HER WEBSITE, ALSO\nCHILD CARE, BUT THE WAY THIS IS TALKED ABOUT IN HILLARY\nCLINTON'S CAMPAIGN AND THE DEMOCRATIC POLICY IS PAID FAMILY\nLEAVE AND ONE OF THE THINGS I READ THAT I THOUGHT WAS\nINTERESTING WAS THERE'S EVIDENCE IF YOU MAKE IT JUST MATERNITY\nLEAVE YOU END UP HURTING WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE BECAUSE\nEMPLOYERS THINK TO THEMSELVES OH, MAN, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO\nDEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM OF THEM TAKING LEAVE WHEREAS PAID FAMILY\nLEAVE DOES A BETTER JOB OF SORT OF LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD IN\nTHAT RESPECT? >> THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE.\nONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT BEING THE LAST DEVELOPED COUNTRY\nTO IMPLEMENT ANY KIND OF PAID MATERNITY, PATERNITY, FAMILY\nLEAVE IS WE'VE LEARNED A LOT FROM OTHER COUNTRIES.\nWHEN YOU ONLY OFFER MATERNITY LEAVE, TWO THINGS HAPPEN.\nONE EMPLOYERS BECOME MORE SKEPTICAL AND MORE LIKELY TO\nDISCRIMINATE AGAINST WOMEN BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT THEY'RE\nGOING TO DISAPPEAR FOR MATERNITY LEAVE AND THEY DON'T HAVE THAT\nFEAR FOR MEN. BUT THE SECOND THING IS THAT\nFAMILIES MAKE THAT DECISION THAT WOMEN ARE MORE LIKELY TO TAKE\nTIME OFF BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES WHOSE TIME OFF IS FUNDED,\nTHEN THAT PERPETUATES INEQUALITY WITHIN THE HOUSEHOLD WHICH MAKES\nIT HARDER FOR WOMEN TO PLAY AN EQUAL ROLE IN THE WORKFORCE.\nTHAT PROBLEM REINFORCES ITSELF OVER THE NEXT 18 YEARS.\n>> DO YOU THINK -- CAN YOU IMAGINE A UNIVERSE IN WHICH\nTHERE IS ACTUAL -- I MEAN, I JOKED TODAY THAT NOW THAT WE\nHAVE SOME BIPARTISAN BUY-IN FOR THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE, EVEN IF\nHILLARY CLINTON WINS, OBVIOUSLY, REPUBLICANS WILL HELP HER GET\nTHIS POLICY DONE. I WAS SORT OF TONGUE IN CHEEK.\nBUT DO YOU THINK THAT'S A PLAUSIBLE SCENARIO?\n>> THE COUNTRY HAS MOVED VERY SHARPLY AND VERY QUICKLY TOWARDS\nTHE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE SUPPORTING A PLAN FOR PAID\nFAMILY LEAVE. AND I THINK IT IS THE SMART\nTHING AND THE RIGHT THING FOR REPUBLICANS TO GET ON BOARD.\nI DO THINK WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO COME UP WITH A TRULY\nBIPARTISAN WAY TO GET THE LEGISLATION DONE.\nBUT I DO NOT THINK THAT TRUMP HAS PROPOSED ANYTHING THAT'S\nCLOSE TO BIPARTISAN. WE HAVEN'T EVEN TALKED ABOUT HIS\nABSURD PLAN TO PAY FOR IT. BUT I DO THINK THAT WE'RE GOING\nTO MOVE TO WHERE THERE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT\nBECAUSE BOTH REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC VOTERS WANT PAID\nFAMILY LEAVE. >> ALL RIGHT.\nTHANKS FOR YOUR TIME. I SHOULD NOTE THAT PRESIDENT --\nPRESIDENT? DONALD TRUMP MENTIONED IN HIS\nSPEECH THAT HILLARY CLINTON DOES NOT HAVE A POLICY ON THIS.\nSHE VERY MUCH DOES. IT'S RIGHT THERE.\nTHIS IS ON EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION WHERE SHE TALKED ABOUT\nPAID LEAVE AND THERE'S ALSO CHILD CARE ALL OF WHICH ARE\nTHEMES TONIGHT. THOSE HAVE BEEN LAID OUT BY\nHILLARY CLINTON I THINK BACK IN JUNE 2015, IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN.\nSTILL TO COME, SOME PROFESSIONAL REPUBLICANS ARE STARTING TO\nTHINK DONALD TRUMP JUST MIGHT WIN THIS THING AND THEY'RE\nPANICKING. THEY'RE FREAKING OUT.\nDETAILS AHEAD.",

SHE CALLED THESE AMERICANS EVERY\nNAME IN THE BOOK. RACISTS, SEXISTS, SXENOPHOBIC,\nISLAMOPHOBIC.

A FEW THINGS HE'S SAID ABOUT\nMEXICANS AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN PEOPLE, JUST TO REFRESH YOUR\nMEMORY. >> WHEN MEXICO SENDS ITS PEOPLE,\nTHEY'RE NOT SENDING THEIR BEST.

TRUMP TREATED THE PRESS\nDEPLORABLE, PENNED US UP, BLACKBALLED PEOPLE WHO ASKS\nQUESTIONS HE DOESN'T THINK IS FAIR.\nHILLARY CLINTON, NO PROTECTION IN EITHER OF THEIR CAMPS AND\nJUST LAST WEEK WHEN A PRESS PERSON DARED TO TALK ABOUT THE\nCOUGHING, THE QUOTE FROM THE CAMPAIGN IS, \"GET A LIFE.\"\nNOT PARTICULARLY GOOD BEHAVIOR ON EITHER OF THEIR PARTS.\n>> NOT AT ALL, BUT ASHLEIGH, I THINK THE KEY ISSUE IS THIS --\nBOTH OF THESE CAMPAIGNS ARE GOING TO TREAT THE PRESS AS\nBADLY AS THEY'RE ALLOWED TO AND AS BADLY AS THE VOTERS ALLOW\nTHEM TO. THE CLINTONS HAVE BEEN\nSECRETIVE, SOMETIMES THEY'RE DOING BAD THINGS, SOMETIMES\nBECAUSE THEY'RE PARANOID. TRUMP THREATENED PEOPLE,\nSNATCHED PRESS CREDENTIALS PEOPLE I KNOW AFTER THEY'VE\nREGISTERED FOR THINGS AND MORE SO, WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT HIS\nHEALTH, HE'LL TALK TO DR. OZ, NOT A JOURNALIST.\nIT'S ABOUT BOTH CANDIDATES REALIZING I CAN TREAT THE PRESS\nHOWEVER I WANT, THE VOTERS AREN'T GOING TO MIND.\nWE NEED ANSWERS FROM BOTH OF THESE CANDIDATES BEFORE WE GO TO\nTHE VOTING BOOTH SO THAT IS UNFORTUNATE.\n>> AND LET ME BRING YOU BACK ON THE DIVISIVENESS.\nTHERE WERE SUPPORTERS BROUGHT UP ONSTAGE WITH TRUMP LAST NIGHT.\nI THINK A COUPLE OF EDUCATORS. AVERAGE AMERICANS WHO GOT UP ON\nTHAT STAGE AND SPOKE TO THAT CROWD SAYING I'M THE TRUMP\nSUPPORTER AM I ONE OF THE ONES IN THAT BASKET OF DEPLORABLES?\n>> IT'S VERY INTERESTING. THIS IS A STAGE OF THE CAMPAIGN\nAND A CONTROVERSY THAT BOTH CAMPAIGNS WANT TO TALK ABOUT.\nTHE DEPLORABLES ISSUE ALLOWS DONALD TRUMP, AS YOU SAID, TO\nPOSE AS THINK CHAMPION OF HEARTLAND, BLUE COLLAR VOTERS,\nTO RE-CREATE THAT PERSONA THAT HELPED HIM WIN THE PRIMARY RACE\nAND PORTRAY HILLARY CLINTON AT THE ELITE FROM THE EAST.\nA GOOD MESSAGE IN SWING STATES, MAY HELP SLIGHTLY AMONG VOTERS\nPERHAPS ON THE FENCE, BUT HAVE GREAT SUSPICIONS OF WASHINGTON\nAND GREAT IS A PSUSPICIONS OF T MEDIA AND DEMOCRATS.\nIT MAY PUSH VOTES IN THIS DIRECTION.\nAT THE SAME TIME, THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS ENGAGING ON THIS.\nIS IT ABOUT WHETHER TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN IS AN XENOPHOBES AND\nBIGOTS, SEXISTS, THAT'S GOOD FOR THEM.\nTHE WAY HILLARY CLINTON WINS THE GENERAL ELECTION IS DRIVE OUT\nTHE OBAMA COALITION FROM 2008 AND 2012 NAP IS THE KIND OF\nMESSAGE THAT COULD GET PEOPLE TO THE POLLS OR PERHAPS SORT OF\nWORRIED ABOUT WHETHER, AM I GOING TO VOTE FOR HILLARY?\nSHOW UP, OR NOT? >> SO, LARRY, YOU KNOW, IF YOU\nWERE WATCHING LAST NIGHT, A LOT OF VIDEO OF A TRUMP SUPPORTER IN\nTHE CROWD WHO APPEARED TO ATTACK A PROTESTORS.\nREALLY PHYSICALLY. I MEAN CHOKE AND PUNCH ONE OF\nTHE PROTESTORS. WE'VE SEEN THIS IN THE PAST.\nIT DOESN'T SEEM TO GET A LOT OF PLAY AFTER ABOUT TWO, THREE\nWEEKS, BUT HERE WE ARE AGAIN WITH NEW VIDEO OF IT.\nI'M WONDERING IF YOU HAVE THAT KIND OF THING COMPARED TO A\nVIDEO OF HILLARY CLINTON CALLING, YOU KNOW, HALF OF TRUMP\nSUPPORTERS A BASKET OF DEPLORABLES.\nWHAT HAPPENS WITH THE UNDECIDED VOTERS?\nWHAT IN THIS ELECTION CYCLE, AND IT'S HARD, BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO\nCOMPARE THIS TO ANY ELECTION CYCLE.\nWHAT HAPPENS WITH UNDECIDED VOTER WHO SEE UGLINESS LIKE THIS\nON BOTH SIDES? >> WELL, THEY MAY VOTE FOR GARY\nJOHNSON, THE LIBERTARIAN OR JILL STEIN, ANOTHER PARTY CANDIDATE.\nTHEY ARE POLLING TOGETHER AT LEAST 150 PER10% OF VOTE, UNUSU\nHIGH FOR INDEPENDENTS. THE TRUTH IS, WE TALK ABOUT\nTHESE INDEPENDENTS, DEPENDS HOW YOU DEFINE THEM, BUT I WOULD\nARGUE THERE ARE ACTUALLY 10% OR LESS THAT ARE TRULY UNDECIDED.\nMAYBE EVEN MID TO LOW SINGLE DIGITS.\nMOST PEOPLE KNOW HOW THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE.\nTHEY'RE LEANING, OR THEY HAVE FIRMLY DECIDED.\nIT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO BE UNDECIDED IN THIS PARTICULAR\nELECTION. MOST PEOPLE HAVE STRONG\nFEELINGS. >> SO I WANT TO PLAY SOMETHING\nTHAT HAPPENED ON THE MORNING SHOW HERE ON CNN, ON \"NEW DAY\nTODAY,\" BECAUSE SOMETIME THIS WEEK WE'RE EXPECTING AT LEAST\nMORE INFORMATION ABOUT HEALTH, MAYBE FROM BOTH OF THE\nCANDIDATES, MAYBE HILLARY WILL RETURN TO THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\nSHE SAID SHE'LL RELEASE MORE INFORMATION.\nDONALD TRUMP SAID HE GOT ANOTHER CHECKUP FROM HIS DOCTOR AND\nPLANS TO RELEASE MORE INFORMATION AND KELLYANNE CONWAY\nWAS ASKED ABOUT THAT ORIGINAL DOCTOR'S LETTER THAT MADE SO\nMANY OUTRIGHT LAUGH, THE ASTASTON\nINGISHINGLY GOOD HEALTH RECORD. >> AS FAR AS I CAN SEE THERE ARE\nTWO MAJOR PARTY CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AND ONLY\nONE HAS PNEUMONIA AND LIED ABOUT IT, ESPECIALLY TO THE PRESS.\nSHE ALWAYS THINKS SHE, TREATS YOU ALL LIKE SECOND-CLASS PRESS\nCONFERENCES. WON'T HAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE\nAND UPLIFTS, ASPIRATIONAL AND GOES ON TO ATTACK TENS OF\nMILLIONS OF AMERICANS THE VERY NEXT DAY.\n>> WELL, THAT SORT OF MIGRATED AWAY FROM THE HEALTH QUESTION\nAND I THINK THE HEALTH QUESTION REMAINS BIG.\nJASON, THE BIG PART OF IT IS, WILL THIS END UP BEING BATTLE OF\nTHE EXPERTS? BATTLE OF THE DOCTORS?\nWHOSE DOCTOR IS MORE CREDIBLE WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT THE\nCAMPAIGNS ARE GOING TO RELEASE? >> ACTUALLY I THINK IT'S A\nMATTER, ASHLEIGH, OF VOTER PERCEPTION.\nA GENDER ASPECT, AN HON NEFRTES ASPECT.\nA LONG TIME TRUMP SURROGATES HAVE SAID HILLARY'S SICK,\nUNHEALTHY. SHE'S GOT A BODY DOUBLE.\nBASICALLY SAYING THAT THE DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGN IS \"WEEKEND\nAT BERNIE'S.\" PASSED AWAY MONTHS AGO AND\nTHEY'RE PROPPING HER UP TO WIN THE WHITE HOUSE.\nTHIS PLAYS UP TO A NOTION OF A DISHONEST FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\nTHAT WORKS FOR DONALD TRUMP. ON A PRACTICAL LEVEL, MOST DON'T\nCARE. THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T HAVE TO\nLEAD US AGAINST THE WAR OF THE VIKINGS.\nAS LONG AS IT'S NOT CANCER OR LIFE-THREATENING, I DON'T THINK\nVOTERS WILL CHANGE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.\nIF HILLARY CLINTON COLLAPSES DURING A DEBATE, THAT'S ONE\nTHING. IF SHE CAN CONTINUE TO CAMPAIGN\nIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS, I DON'T THINK IT WILL CHANGE\nANYTHING. >> JASON JOHNSON WITH THE NEW 70\nIS THE NEW 50.

JOINING US FROM CLEVELAND,\nKYLE, WHO WORKS FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA\nCENTER FOR POLITICS. YOU GUYS ARE ALSO ANALYZING\nTHE ELECTORAL COLLEGE. ARE YOU ON THE SAME TRACK AS\nFOX NEWS IS? >> YEAH.\nWE DO THINK THAT CLINTON HAS GOT A LITTLE BIT OVER 270\nPRETTY SOLID ELECTORAL VOTES.\nTHERE IS AN ADDITIONAL GROUP OF 70 ELECTORAL VOTES WHERE\nCLINTON IS LEADING BUT WHERE TRUMP IS VERY COMPETITIVE.\nTHE STATE OF OHIO WHERE I AM RIGHT NOW IS VERY\nCOMPETITIVE. BUT I THINK CLINTON HAS A\nSMALL LEAD. FLORIDA, IOWA, NORTH\nCAROLINA WHICH MITT ROMNEY WON.\nI THINK IN ORDER TO WIN, TRUMP NEEDS TO PUT AWAY\nSTATES LIKE OHIO, FLORIDA, AND IOWA AND THEN START\nEATING INTO THE TRADITIONAL DEMOCRATIC STATES MAYBE A\nPENNSYLVANIA OR A WISCONSIN OR ONE OF THEM.\nBUT, SO FAR. >> HE SEEMS TO BE CLOSE IN\nWISCONSIN.

I DON'T BELIEVE IT HOLDS.\n>> THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE FOR THAT.\n>> RIGHT. >> SO JUST TODAY WE HAD A\nPOLL JUST CAME OUT FROM THE \"BOSTON GLOBE\" SHOWING\nCLINTON ONLY UP IN THREE IN MAINE WHICH OBAMA WON BY 16.\nANOTHER POLL CAME OUT SHOWING THAT TRUMP WAS ONLY\nUP 6 IN TEXAS. ROMNEY WON TEXAS BY 16.\nSO THERE IS SOME WEIRD THINGS GOING ON OUT THERE.\n>> HERE'S THE REASON. HILLARY CLINTON IS A\nSUSPICIOUS CANDIDATE. THAT'S THE BEST WORD.\nI'M NOT SAYING THIS IN ANY CONDEMNATION OR ANY KIND OF\nIDEOLOGICAL WAY. MANY AMERICANS ARE\nSUSPICIOUS OF HER. OKAY?\nSO YOU DIDN'T HAVE THAT WITH GORE OR KERRY OR OBAMA.\nPEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE THEM OR LIKE THEIR POLICIES OR\nWHATEVER. THERE IS A PERSONAL\nSUSPICION SURROUNDING HILLARY CLINTON NOW THAT IS\nUNIQUE IN MY LIFETIME. REMEMBER, RICHARD NIXON\nDIDN'T HAVE THAT UNTIL AFTER HE WAS IN OFFICE.\nON THE OTHER SIDE, DONALD TRUMP IS LARGELY HATED OR\nLOVED, ALL RIGHT? BUT THOSE WHO LOVE HIM, THEY\nARE COMING OUT. TRUMP CAMPAIGN BELIEVES THEY\nWILL POLL PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN OUT BEFORE\nBECAUSE HE ENGENDERS THAT KIND OF EMOTION.\nEITHER LOATHING OR LOVE. AND THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nVOTE, IF IT ISN'T MOBILIZED AT THE SAME EXTENT THAT\nBARACK OBAMA SAW, IS -- WILL BRING HILLARY CLINTON DOWN 2\nOR 3 PERCENTAGE POINTS. THIS MODEL THIS YEAR IS\nTOTALLY DIFFERENT THAN ALL THE OTHER YEARS.\n>> WELL, DO I AGREE THAT IF THE DEMOCRATS HAVE A\nPROBLEM, I THINK IT IS AN ENTHUSIASM PROBLEM\nPARTICULARLY AMONGST THE YOUNGEST VOTERS WHICH IS THE\nMOST UNRELIABLE GROUP OF VOTERS AND ALMOST THE MOST\nDIVERSE. THINK ABOUT A STATE LIKE\nOHIO, THERE ARE A LOT OF BIG UNIVERSITIES IN OHIO.\nCLINTON IS GOING TO NEED OPTIMAL TURNOUT IN THOSE\nPLACES AND A LOT OF PLACES WHERE BERNIE SANDERS DID\nWELL IN THE PRIMARY. WE ALSO SEE THAT\nPARTICULARLY THE YOUNGEST VOTERS 18 TO 24, A LOT OF\nTHEM ARE SAYING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO SUPPORT GARY\nJOHNSON OR JILL STEIN. >> TICK OFF 10% JOHNSON.\n>> SURE. >> HILLARY CLINTON HAS A\nVERY GOOD GET OUT THE VOTE ORGANIZATION IN ALL OF THESE\nSTATES. >> RIGHT.\n>> WHEREAS TRUMP IS RELYING MORE ON HIS PERSONAL\nCHARISMA TO CARRY THE DAY. >> RIGHT.\n>> SO ON ELECTION DAY, IF TRUMP DOES WELL IN DEBATES,\nTHIS IS THE BIG CAVEAT. IF SHE HOLDS HER OWN WITH\nTRUMP, IS HE NOT GOING TO WIN.\n>> I AGREE. >> IF HE WINS, IF HE DEFEATS\nHER ON THE DEBATE ON POLICY, CAN'T CALL HER CROOKED\nHILLARY, CAN'T MAKE FUN OF HER PANTS SUITS.\nWHEN SHE STARTS COUGHING THROW WATER ON HER.\nTHAT WAS NOT GOOD. HE CANNOT DO THAT.\n>> AND BILL, ONE OTHER THING STILL A PRETTY BIG MAJORITY\nOF THE PUBLIC DOESN'T THINK THAT TRUMP IS QUALIFIED FOR\nTHE JOB. >> HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO\nPROVE THAT. >> THAT'S WHERE THE DEBATES\nCOME IN. THE SPEECH HE GAVE TONIGHT\nABOUT CHILD CARE POLICY. THAT IS A STEP HIS CAMPAIGN\nWAS TRYING TO TAKE. >> HE IS GOING TO DO ANOTHER\nONE THIS WEEK ON HIS ECONOMIC PLAN.\nIS HE READING OFF THE PROMPTER.\nWHOLE DIFFERENT BALLGAME WHEN YOU ARE TALKING THAN\nWHEN YOU ARE READING.

WHAT DO YOU DO HERE?\nSOMETIMES THE CASE IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.\nTHAT WAS TODAY WHEN I LISTENED TO MONEY MANAGER BILL MILLER AT\nDELIVERING ALPHA. I STILL REGARD THAT AS A GREAT\nBENCHMARK, HE DID SOMETHING BECAUSE THE TEN-YEAR BOND\nYIELDED 9% AND SIX-MONTH TREASURY BILL WORTH 6%.\nTHESE DAYS, FIXED INCOME, ACCOUNT STOCKS, DIFFERENT\nPICTURE. UNCOMPETITIVE 1.73% AND\nSIX-MOBILE .53%. EVEN THOUGH THE SAIP 500 IS MORE\nEXPENSIVE NOW THAN A PRICED EARNINGS BASIS THEN, HE TOLD THE\nCROWD THAT STOCKS ARE, AND I QUOTE, STUPIDLY CHEAP WHILE\nBONDS ARE RIDICULOUSLY OVERPRICED.\nHE REMINDED US, AND I QUOTE AGAIN, OUTLOOK FOR THE U.S.\nECONOMY IS SOLID. AMONG THE BEST IN THE WORLD.\nLOW INFLATION AND LOW UNEMPLOYMENT.\nRECORD PRODUCTS, RECORD GDP, RECORD HOUSEHOLD NET WORTH,ANT\nQUOTE. HE WANTS TO SELL BONDS AND BUY\nSTOCKS FOR THOSE REASONS.

RIGHT NOW I PREFER TO HAVE A\nHIGHER CASH POSITION AS I HAVE FOR MY CHARITABLE TRUST.\nYOU CAN FOLLOW ALONG ON IT.

INSTEAD, TAKE OUR CUE FROM THE\nVALUE THAT STOCKS ARE OFFERING AND BY THE WAY, AS THEY COME\nDOWN, THEY GET CHEAPER. NOT MORE EXPENSIVE.\nJANICE IN TEXAS, JANICE? >> HEY, JIM.\n>> HEY, JANICE. >> YAHOO!

So when my asthma symptoms kept\n          coming back     on my long-term control\n           medicine.    I talked to my doctor and\n     found a missing piece   in my asthma treatment with\n             BREO. Once-daily BREO prevents asthma\n          symptoms.        BREO is for adults with asthma not well controlled  on a long-term asthma control\n           medicine, like an inhaled corticosteroid.   BREO won't replace a rescue\n            inhaler for sudden breathing problems.      BREO opens up airways to help improve breathing for a\n         full 24 hours. BREO contains a type of medicine that increases the risk of death       from asthma problems    and may increase the risk\n     of hospitalization in children and adolescents. BREO is not for people whose    asthma is well controlled\n             on a     long-term asthma control\n           medicine,         like an inhaled\n        corticosteroid.     Once your asthma is well\n          controlled,        your doctor will\n         decide if you          can stop BREO\n        and prescribe a     different asthma control\n           medicine,         like an inhaled\n        corticosteroid.    Do not take BREO more than\n          prescribed.       See your doctor if\n          your asthma        does not improve\n         or gets worse.   Ask your doctor if 24-hour\n              BREO    could be a missing piece\n            for you.  See if you're eligible for  12 months free at myBREO.com.",

THE STORY OF THE DAY, THE DOW\nLOSING 258 POINTS AND REALLY STARTED WITH THE BOND MARKET.\nCHECK OUT THE YIELD. THIS IS WHY IT MATTERS TO\nSTOCKS. 7 OF THE 10 S&P SECTORS\nCURRENTLY YIELD MORE THAN THE TEN-YEAR BOND.\nINVESTORS BUYING STOCKS BECAUSE THEY ARE THE NEW BONDS.\nHOW BIG OF A PROBLEM IS THIS? BK.\n>> WELL, LISTEN, WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS.\nI MEAN, IT'S MADE ME SICK, WE TALKED ABOUT IT SO MUCH.\nTHIS IS WHAT IS GOING ON. PEOPLE ARE BUYING BONDS.\nWE'RE BUYING BONDS FOR CAPITAL APPRECIATION AND STOCKS FOR\nYIELD. IT'S AN UPSIDE DOWN MARKET.\nIT'S AN UPSIDE DOWN WORLD. NOW IT'S STARTING TO COME HOME\nTO ROOST. THE VOLATILITIES INCREASED.\nAND THE OTHER THING YOU NEED TO KNOW, THERE IS SOME UNDERLYING\nKRENTSZ. SOME STRATEGIES OUT THERE THAT\nBUY BOTH STOCKS AND BONDS. AND WHEN THE VOLATILITY IS LOW,\nTHEY GET BIGGER IN THEIR STOCK POSITIONS.\nWHEN THE VOLATILITY GOES HIGH, THEN THEY HAVE TO SELL THOSE\nSTOCK POSITIONS AND SELL THE BOND POSITIONS.\nSO THAT'S WHY YOU'RE STARTING TO SEE BOTH OF THESE COME DOWN.\nAND I WOULD SAY, IF YOU'RE A BULL, YOU WANT TO ROOT FOR LOWER\nRATES, BECAUSE HIGHER RATES ARE NOT GOOD FOR THIS STOCK MARKET.\n>> THOSE SO-CALLED RISK PAR ITY FUNDS.\nOUR FRIEND FROM JPMORGAN. WHAT WAS SO STUNNING ABOUT THE\nSELLOFF TODAY, ACROSS THE BOARD. DIDN'T MATTER WHAT ASSET\nCLASSES, BONDS, STOCKS, GOLD. >> RIGHT.\n>> AND THEN AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE DOLLAR REVERSED AS\nWELL. >> SOME OF THAT ENDS UP BEING\nPANIC AND WE HEAR ABOUT IT ALL OF THE TIME.\nWHEN PEOPLE ARE FEELING THE PAIN IN CERTAIN PLACES, THEY GO TO\nTHE PLACES WHERE THEY HAVE HAD WINNERS AND START TO TAKE SOME\nOF THAT OFF, AS WELL. SO I THINK THAT COMBINATION IS\nWHY WE SAW THIS JUST FOLLOW THROUGH AT THE VERY END OF THE\nDAY. WE ACTUALLY DROPPED ANOTHER 40\nPOINTS FROM WHERE WE WERE TRADING IN THE LAST MAYBE 15\nMINUTES OF THE DAY. WE HAVE BEEN TALKING FOR A\nREALLY LONG TIME ABOUT  SINCE THE MIDDLE OF JULY,\nSOMEWHERE BETWEEN 11 AND 13. NOW THESE BIG SPIKES IN\nVOLATILITY. THE OPPORTUNITY WAS, EITHER YOU\nWANT TO PROTECT OR YOU DO STOCK REPLACEMENT.\nWE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT TIME AND TIME AGAIN.\nONE OF THESE DAYS, PEOPLE WILL START LISTENING.\nBUT THEY OFTENTIMES DON'T, BECAUSE THEY GET VERY, VERY\nBULLHEADED IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY THINK IS REALLY GOING TO HAPPEN\nAND HOW LONG IT'S GOING TO EXTEND.\nSOONER OR LATER THAT ENDS. IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S ENDING RIGHT\nNOW AND VOLATILITY, BREAKING ABOVE THE 200-DAY MOVING AVERAGE\nFOR THE VIX, PRETTY IMPRESSIVE. PRETTY HEALTHY MOVE WHEN YOU\nLOOK AT A WEEK OR SO AGO, TRADING IN THE 12TH AND NOW\nWE'RE 18s AND IN THE 20s. INCREDIBLE HOW MUCH VOLATILITY\nCAN REALLY EXPLODE IN TIMES LIKE THIS WHEN PEOPLE SEE PANIC.\nTHAT DOESN'T MEAN THERE IS NOT OPPORTUNITIES OUT THERE.\nA FEW THINGS I WAS ABLE TO BUY TODAY.\nI ACTUALLY ADDED TO APPLE. I ALSO BOUGHT INTO LULULEMON.\nAND I ALSO LOOKED AT A FEW OTHER NAMES I THOUGHT WERE VERY, VERY\nINTERESTING. JETBLUE BEING ONE OF THEM IN THE\nAIRLINE INDUSTRY. >> HERE'S THE THING.\nPETE JUST LAID OUT THE VOLATILITY PICTURE.\nSIX OR SEVEN WEEKS, IT WAS BORING.\nHAD TO MAKE STORIES UP HERE AND THERE.\nBUT HERE ALL OF A SUDDEN NOW WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE RATES ARE\nMOVING, STOCKS ARE MOVING, IT'S ALL HAPPENING VERY SHORT PERIOD\nOF TIME. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO\nREMEMBER, THE LAST TIME THE FED RAISED INTEREST RATES, LAST\nDECEMBER, THE FIRST TIME IN NINE YEARS, THE YIELD IN THE TEN-YEAR\nTREASURY 2.2%. HERE WE ARE AT 1.73 AND PEOPLE\nARE PANICKING IN THE STOCK MARKET A LITTLE BIT AS WE'RE UP\nFROM 1.31 A COUPLE MONTHS AGO HERE.\nAND I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE REASON TO PANIC.\nBECAUSE WE HAVE INTEREST RATES MOVING HIGHER, WE KNOW THAT THE\nFED IS NOT GOING TO BE RAISING RATES UNTIL DECEMBER.\nIN SOME WAYS -- >> I DON'T KNOW IF WE KNOW THAT.\n>> WE KIND OF DO. THEY MADE A FAIRLY CLEAR OVER\nTHE LAST COUPLE DAYS THAT THEY MAY GO IN SEPTEMBER.\n>> NOT A CHANCE. >> I'M NOT SURE IT'S AS CLEAR.\nI DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD. BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT\nCLEAR. >> WHEN THE FED LOWERS RATES,\nTHEY WANT TO SURPRISE THE MARKET AND THEY WANT TO HAVE THAT\nEFFECT ON THE STOCK MARKET OR ON RISK ASSETS IN GENERAL.\nTHEY DON'T WANT TO DO IT THE OTHER WAY, RIGHT?\n>> THEY DON'T -- IF THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT RAISING RATES,\nTHEY DON'T WANT TO SHOCK YOU ON IT.\nTHAT'S WHY THEY HAVE COME OUT OVER THE LAST WEEK AND SAID\nTHAT. >> THE FUTURES ARE PRICEY --\n>> THEY'RE TRYING TO MANIPULATE THAT MARKET.\nTHEY'RE TRYING TO GET THAT MARKET --\n>> WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT? >> THEY DON'T WANT TO RAISE\nRATES. >> GOING BACK TO 1994, GOLDMAN\nSACHS RESEARCH FROM MAY. WHEN THEY LOOKED AT THE 31 RATE\nINCREASES, OKAY? DURING THAT TIME PERIOD, 50%,\nOKAY -- 50% PROBABILITY OF A RATE HIKE 30 DAYS PRYER.\nTHEY DON'T LIKE TO SURPRISE. >> THAT'S MY POINT.\n>> THIS IS WHAT WE'VE GOT. WE GOT THAT ON FRIDAY, THE\nREACTION TODAY. YOU KNOW WHAT'S STRIKING ABOUT\nFRIDAY AND TODAY? >> TELL ME, PLEASE.\n>> THE S&P 500 CLOSED -- WE'RE A FEW POINTS AWAY FROM WHERE WE\nACTUALLY CLOSED ON FRIDAY. THAT'S WHAT THE DAMAGE HAS BEEN.\nROUND TRIP. >> TOTAL ROUND TRIP.\nTO ME THE DAMAGE STARTED WITH SOVEREIGN BONDS.\n>> YES, DEFINITELY. >> IT'S INTERESTING.\nWE HAD KEVIN O'LEARY ON I FORGET WHAT NIGHT LAST WEEK, TALKED\nABOUT WHY HE WANTED TO BE IN EUROPEAN STOCKS BECAUSE THE ECB\nHAD HIS BACK. THE NEXT DAY, THE ECB BASICALLY\nCAME OUT AND SAID, GUESS WHAT, KEVIN O'LEARY, WE NO LONGER HAVE\nYOUR BACK. AND IF YOU LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENED\nTO INTEREST RATES SINCE THEN, THEY HAVE ALL GONE UP IN A\nSIGNIFICANT FASHION. SO I THINK U.S. RATES ARE MORE\nFUNCTION OF WHAT'S HAPPENING OVERSEAS.\nDOESN'T MATTER. GETS YOU TO THE SAME PLACE.\n>> INCLUDING THE GERMAN IT TEN-YEAR BOND.\nWE SAW THAT RISE FROM NEGATIVE. >> NEGATIVE YIELDING BONDS ARE A\nBUBBLE. ALMOST BY DEFINITION.\nIT'S -- IT'S NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.\nAND IT'S -- IT'S HAPPENING NOW. YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE LONG.\nTHOSE TYPE OF FIXED INCOME. I COULD MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT\nON A SELLOFF YOU WANT TO START BUYING TLT ON A RELATIVE VALUE\nBASIS. >> BUYING --\n>> THAT'S WHAT I WOULD DO. I HAVE ABOUT A THIRD OF A\nPOSITION IN TLT RIGHT NOW. AND IF WE GET, LET'S SAY BACK TO\nMAYBE -- IF WE GET TO 180-ISH ON THE TEN-YEAR, I'LL PROBABLY ADD\nA LITTLE MORE TLT, BECAUSE WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THE\nFUNDAMENTALS OF THE ECONOMY ARE DETERIORATING, EVEN IF THE FED\nRAISES. THEN PEOPLE ARE STILL GOING TO\nWANT TO BUY TLT, BECAUSE THE DOLLAR IS GOING TO GO UP.\nWHICH HAS BEEN HAPPENING FOR THE LAST YEAR OR SO.\nSO ON THESE PULL BACKS, THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.\n>> SO THE CROSS CURRENT COMING OUT OF DELIVERING ALPHA TODAY,\nSAYING SELL G 7 BONDS. >> I WOULD RATHER SELL GERMAN\nBONDS AND ITALIAN BONDS. >> I THINK THEY'RE STILL A SAFE\nHAVEN. >> WHAT DO YOU THINK?\n>> I THINK YOU CAN BUY U.S. TREASURIES, DO THE TLT CLOSER TO\n130. I DON'T THINK THAT THEY'RE GOING\nTO GO IN SEPTEMBER OR NOVEMBER. AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT --\nTHEY'VE ALREADY PRICED IN A 25 BASIS POINT MOVE SINCE THE FED\nSTARTED TALKING A LITTLE BIT MORE --\n>> SHORT-TERM BUY ON THE MARKET OVERALL?\nYOU THINK THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GO IN SEPTEMBER --\n>> 2050 IN THE S&P. HIGHER THAN IN MID DECEMBER WHEN\nTHEY DID THE RAISE. AND WE ARE AT 3% FROM THE HIGHS.\nI THINK IF YOU GET THAT SORT OF FIBER CENT PULL BACK --\n>> YOU KNOW WHAT STOOD OUT TODAY?\n>> WHAT STOOD OUT TODAY, MELISSA?\n>> TECHNOLOGY. >> YOU HEARD PETEY OVER THERE\nTALKING ABOUT -- APPLE HAD A HUGE PART OF THAT, NO QUESTION\nABOUT IT. WHAT I THOUGHT ALSO IS\nINTERESTING TODAY. NOT TO -- YOUR QUESTION WAS\nFINANCIALS UNDERPERFORMED, RIGHT?\nYOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT ON A DAY LIKE TODAY, FINANCIALS WOULD BE\nDOWN, BUT NOT DOWN NEARLY AS MUCH.\nI DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS BUT DEFINITELY TOOK OUT.\n>> THE YIELD CURVE STEEPENED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF JULY.\n>> WELLS FARGO. AND THEN I WOULD ADD IN OIL,\nTOO. RIGHT?\nWE KNOW THAT AT SOME POINT OIL STOCKS ARE BECOMING -- NOT A 45,\nPROBABLY BELOW 40. YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME PEOPLE\nTAKING PROFITS IN ANTICIPATION OF THAT.\n>> ALL RIGHT. IT HAS BEEN A BUMPY RIGHT FOR\nINVESTORS IN SEPTEMBER, TO SAY THE LEAST.\nIF YOU WOULD HAVE LISTENED OH OUR NEXT GUEST, YOU WOULD HAVE\nMADE SOME MONEY. THERE IS CLEARLY A CASE WE COULD\nGET AN UPSIDE BREAK OUT HERE, BUT WITH THE LONG STOCK GOING\nINTO THE WORST MONTH SEASONALLY SPEAKING, I THINK THE BIGGER\nTRADE IS TO THE DOWN SIDE. THE NECK LINE HERE, 2130, THAT'S\nTHE POINT YOU DO NOT WANT TO GO BENEATH.\n>> 2130. WE'RE AT 2127 ON THE CLOSE HERE.\nSO IS THE CORRECTION COMING? RICH ROSS OF ISI IS BACK.\nWHAT DO YOU SAY, RICH? >> YEAH, MELISSA.\nTHANKS FOR THAT. YOU'RE TOO KIND.\nOBVIOUSLY THE PROBLEM FOR STOCKS IS BONDS.\nIT'S NOT THE ONLY PROBLEM, BUT LET'S FOCUS ON THAT TODAY.\nTHIS IS YOUR TEN-YEAR YIELD. WE SEE YOU'RE STILL IN A DOWN\nTREND, THIS IS A BIG MOVE IN TERMS OF YIELD FROM 135 ALL THE\nWAY BACK UP TO 175, 176. I HEARD BK REFERENCE THIS.\nYOUR 200-DAY. 180.\nABOVE 180, FORGET ABOUT IT. HERE'S THE CHART THAT MAKES IT\nREAL INTERESTING. THE WEEKLY, THE BIG DOUBLE\nBOTTOM HERE, A FALSE BREAKDOWN TO AN ALL-TIME LOW IN YIELD IS\nTHE MIRROR IMAGE OF THE FALSE BREAKOUT TO AN ALL-TIME HIGH IN\nSTOCKS. JULY OF 2012, THE LAST BOTTOM,\nJULY OF 2016. JULY, BAD TIME FOR A BOTTOM IN\nYIELDS AND A -- >> SORRY TO INTERRUPT.\nWE'RE AWAITING SOME NEWS OUT OF DELIVERING ALPHA.\nBOTTOM LINE, THOUGH, CORRECTION? WHAT DO YOU SEE FOR STOCKS?\n>> BOTTOM LINE, YES. 2050, 2,000 IS WHERE I BECOME\nEXTREMELY INTERESTED. 2050, YOU PROBABLY GET A BOUNCE.\n>> THANKS, RICH ISI. WE WANT TO LISTEN IN ON CARL\nICAHN BEING INTERVIEWED BY SCOTT WAPNER.\n>> INTERESTING DAY. DOW DOWN 260 POINTS.\nAND WE'VE HEARD FROM SOME OF THE WORLD'S BEST INVESTORS AND\nBRIGHTEST INVESTORS TODAY WHO SAY THAT TIMES ARE DANGEROUS.\nPAUL SINGER, WHO YOU LISTENED TO BACK IN YOUR OFFICE, SAID THAT\nIT WAS A DANGEROUS TIME. RAY DAHL OWARNED IF THE FED\nRAISES INTEREST RATES, YOU COULD HAVE ASYMMETRIC RISKS.\nARE YOU STILL AS NEGATIVE TODAY AS YOU HAVE BEEN FOR THE BETTER\nPART OF THE LAST YEAR? >> YEAH.\nI MEAN, I DON'T KNOW IF NEGATIVE IS THE RIGHT WORD, EXACTLY.\nBUT I THINK THERE ARE TREMENDOUS RISKS.\nAND -- BUT I THINK ANYONE THAT IS GOING TO TELL YOU IT'S GOING\nTO GO DOWN TOMORROW, NEXT WEEK, EVEN NEXT MONTH OR NEXT YEAR,\nIT'S SORT OF GUESSING GAME. BUT YOU COULD LOOK AT THE\nENVIRONMENT AND I THINK IT'S VERY DANGEROUS.\nIN OTHER WORDS, YOU ARE WALKING ON A LEDGE, AND YOU MIGHT MAKE\nIT TO THE END. BUT, HEY, YOU FALL OFF THAT\nLEDGE, YOU'RE GOING TO REALLY SEE TROUBLE.\nAND I THINK THAT COULD WELL BE. >> WHAT PUSHES YOU OFF THE\nLEDGE? IS IT THE FED RAISING INTEREST\nRATES? YOU THINK THEY SHOULD?\nJAMIE DIMON YESTERDAY SAID THEY SHOULD.\nTODAY RAY DAHL OSAID THEY SHOULDN'T.\nWHAT DOES CARL ICAHN SAY? >> I REALLY WILL TELL YOU I\nDON'T THINK IT MATTERS. BECAUSE EITHER WAY, THERE'S A\nPROBLEM. IF YOU DON'T RAISE INTEREST\nRATES, I THINK WE'RE IN A MAJOR BUBBLE.\nYOU CAN'T -- I THINK CIGNA SAID IT RIGHT.\nI HEARD HIM FOR A WHILE. AND HE IS A VERY SMART GUY.\nI'VE KNOWN HIM FOR YEARS. I THINK HE'S SMART, DESPITE THE\nFACT THAT HE'S NOT FOR TRUMP. I THINK HE'S SMART.\nSO, YEAH. HE TOLD ME THAT.\nYOU KNOW. NO UNCERTAIN TERMS.\nI JUST SAW HIM -- I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM FOR A FEW MONTHS.\nHE TAKES IT REALLY SERIOUSLY. AND HE SAYS ME SOMEWHERE, AND HE\nLOOKS AT ME, \"CARL -- SORT OF COMPLIMENTARY.\nHE SAID, YOU'RE A SMART GUY, YOU'RE A SUPER SMART GUY.\nAND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE'S GOT THIS RAGE.\nHOW CAN YOU BE FOR TRUMP! AND FIRST I WAS LAUGHING.\nAND THEN I SAID, RELAX, RELAX, PAUL.\nAND HE REALLY -- BUT HE'S A VERY -- HE IS A VERY SMART GUY.\nAND HE'S ONE OF THE FEW GUYS I REALLY RESPECT ON WALL STREET.\nAND I THOUGHT -- I LISTENED TO HIM TODAY, AND I HONESTLY -- A\nLOT OF THE THINGS HE SAID I COULDN'T HAVE SAID IT BETTER\nMYSELF. AND THAT'S SAYING A LOT.\nHE -- HE WAS RIGHT ON. YOU KNOW WHAT HE WAS REALLY ON\nAND -- WE GET INTO THESE REGULATORY AGENCIES.\nAND THERE ARE GOOD REGULATORY AGENCIES THAT DO GOOD JOBS, GOOD\nREGULATORS. BUT THERE ARE SO MANY THAT --\nHIS WORDS WERE RIGHT ON. AMAZINGLY ARREST FWANT WHEN YOU\nTALK TO THEM. AND --\n>> YOU'VE TAKEN ON THE EPA. >> IT'S NOT EVEN TAKING ON.\nA WOMAN IN THE EPA, LOOK, I'M TOO OLD NOT TO BE POLITICALLY\nCORRECT. THIS WOMAN, JANET McCABE.\nAND YOU KNOW, SHE'S NUMBER TWO SOMETHING OR OTHER.\nAND SHE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MOST IDIOTIC -- AND, LOOK, I\nHAVE AN AGENDA HERE. BUT THE REASON I'M BRINGING IT\nUP IS IT FITS INTO WHAT IT IS WRONG WITH OUR ECONOMY.\nPEOPLE LIKE HER. AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY.\nNO, SERIOUSLY. AND EVERYBODY IS AFRAID TO SAY\nANYTHING ABOUT. OH, DON'T SAY ANYTHING, THERE\nWILL BE REPRISAL. I'M TOO OLD FOR THAT.\nLET THEM DO REPRISAL. WE OWN A REFINERY.\nREFINERIES, A COUPLE OF THEM. AND HERE'S WHAT THEY DO.\nAND HERE'S HOW IRRATIONAL IT IS. AND SHE'S RUNNING THIS PROGRAM.\nAND GET THIS. IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE.\nIT'S LIKE OUT OF \"ALICE IN WONDERLAND.\"\nTHEY HAVE THIS PROGRAM WHERE -- I'M NOT AGAINST THE RFS, AND I'M\nNOT -- I'M CERTAINLY NOT AGAINST ETHANOL OR FOR ETHANOL OR CLEAN\nAIR. I LIKE CLEAN AIR, I THINK IT'S\nGREAT. BUT THE WHOLE POINT OF WHAT I'M\nSAYING IS, THAT A FEW YEARS AGO, THEY PASSED THE CLEAN AIR ACT,\nAND RENEWABLE FUEL STANDARDS. AND THAT'S FINE.\nAND THEN THEY COME TO THE -- THEY COME TO THIS POINT, THEY GO\nTO THE EPA AND SAY, IN ALL YOUR WISDOM.\nAND I WILL SAY THIS. I MEAN, JANET McCABE, I'M\nCERTAIN SHE IS A SMART WOMAN AND NICE WOMAN.\nNEVER RUN A BUSINESS, NO BUSINESS BACKGROUND.\nAND THEY SAY, YOU OR WHOEVER DID THIS, YOU ARE GOING TO POLICE\nTHE FACT THAT IN THE CLEAN AIR ACT -- I'M GOING TO MAKE IT\nSIMPLE, BECAUSE I KNOW SCOTT IS GOING TO PUSH ME OFF IN A\nMINUTE, BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS MUCH.\nBUT,",

NASDAQ GIVING UP 56.\nDOWN ABOUT 1.1% TO 5155. WE WILL HAVE MORE ON ALL OF THIS\nPLUS MOVES ON OIL AND BONDS. IT IS ANOTHER BUSY HOUR FROM\nDELIVERING ALPHA. WE WILL SPEAK TO BILL MILLER\nLIVE FROM THE CONFERENCE AND STEVE SCHWARZMAN AND CARL ICAHN\nBOTH SET TO TAKE THE STAGE LATER THIS HOUR.\nJOINING ME ON THE PANEL TODAY WE HAVE SENIOR MARKET COMMENTATOR\nMIKE SAN THOLE HERE. WELCOME, GUYS.\nFOR MORE ON TODAY'S MARKET ACTION THERE IS SO MUCH TO GET\nHERE. WHAT DO YOU THINK IN A NUT SHELL\nHAS HAPPENED? >> CONTINUING FROM FRIDAY IS\nTHIS BACK UP IN BOND YIELDS WE HAVE HAD GLOBALLY.\nIT IS GIVING A LITTLE BIT OF A SHOCK TO THE PREMISE OF A LOT OF\nSTOCK OWNERSHIP. LOWER FOR LONGER WITH RATES.\nIT ALLOWS YOU TO PAY MORE. IT ALLOWS YOU TO JUSTIFY HIGHER\nVALUEUATIONS. THAT IS THE IMMEDIATE OVERLAY OF\nWHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING HERE. ONCE YOU HAVE THAT BUYER STRIKE\nI DON'T THINK IT IS MOSTLY ABOUT THE FED.\nTHE FED IS LOOKING TOWARDS DECEMBER.\nIT IS JUST ABOUT WHY OUR BOND INVESTORS ARE GETTING COLD FEET.\nWE HAVE NOT MADE NET PROGRESS SINCE JULY 8.\nDOESN'T MEAN IT IS THE WHOLE STORY.\nTHAT IS WHAT I THINK UPSET THE STOCK SIDE.\n>> ANOTHER FASCINATING DEVELOPMENT THAT MAYBE PLAYS\nINTO THIS, MAYBE IT DOESN'T. WE FOUND OUT IN 2015 THAT\nHOUSEHOLD MEDIAN INCOME DROPPED 5%.\nMEDIAN IS A LITTLE BIT LOWER. POINT BEING YOU HAVE ACTUALLY\nVERY GOOD NEWS ABOUT WAGES. MAYBE IT'S ENOUGH TO KEEP GOING.\nMAYBE IT IS JUST ENOUGH FOR PEOPLE TO THINK THE BOND MARKETS\nARE MISPRICED. >> IT IS A LITTLE BIT BACKWARD\nLOOKING. IT TELLS YOU IT IS NOT JUST THAT\nWAGES ARE UP. THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD THINGS.\nIT WIPLAY INTO THE CAMPAIGN. YOU HAVE TO ASSUME MAYBE AMERICA\nISN'T AS BAD AS MR. TRUMP SAYS IT IS.\nIT WILL HELP CLINTON. GOING BACK TO TODAY'S MARKET\nTHERE IS NOTHING, NO SINGLE THING YOU CAN SAY THAT IS WHAT\nFREAKED US OUT. IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN HANG IT ON\nNORTH KOREA BLOWING SOMETHING UP.\nIF ANYTHING YOU CAN PROBABLY SAY IT IS BECAUSE YOU HAD THESE\nAMAZING PEOPLE AT YOUR PANEL TODAY.\nI WAS WATCHING SO MANY OF THESE BILLIONAIRE INVESTORS KIND OF\nREALLY WORRIED MORE THAN THEY WERE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT WHAT IS\nGOING ON. I DON'T KNOW -- I DON'T KNOW\nTHAT PLAYED INTO IT. >> WE CAN SHOW A CHART OF THE\nTEN YEAR, GUY. CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT YOU THINK.\nIT IS ONE THING TO KNOW THERE ARE THESE BEARS OUT THERE.\nANOTHER THING TO HEAR PAUL SINGER MAKE A CASE FOR WHY THE\nPARADIGM MIGHT BE SHIFTING HERE. >> I HAVE BEEN, AS YOU KNOW, I\nHAVE BEEN A STEADFAST BOND BULL FOR QUITE SOME TIME.\nYOU CAN'T BE DOGMATIC IN VIEWS. IF THE MARKET STARTS TO TELL YOU\nSOMETHING HAS CHANGED YOU SORT OF HAVE TO LISTEN TO IT.\nLAST WEEK WE FOUND OUT MAYBE THE ECB DOESN'T HAVE THE MARKETS\nBACK. I THINK PEOPLE SORT OF PUSH PAST\nTHAT. SOMEBODY LIKE JAMIE DIMON SAYING\nTHE FED WILL LOSE -- UNDERSTANDING THAT HE HAS A\nVESTED INTEREST FOR HIS COMPANY HE SAID HE THOUGHT THE FED WOULD\nLOSE CREDIBILITY IF THEY DIDN'T RAISE RATES.\nNOW YOU HAVE THE VOICES TODAY TALKING ABOUT MISSTEPS IN THE\nFED AND ALL THINGS THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT.\nI THINK THAT IS WHAT LEADS YOU DOWN THIS PATH.\nI THINK TO MIKE'S POINT I DON'T THINK IT IS NECESSARILY A U.S.\nBOND MOVE. I THINK IT IS MORE PREDICATED ON\nWHAT IS GOING ON OVERSEAS. IT WILL DRAG U.S. RATES HIGHER,\nAS WELL. IN TERMS OF BROADER MARKET THIS\nIS JUST SORT OF THE -- THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IN THE WAKE OF WHAT\nWE ARE SEEING. THAT BOND MOVEMENT FROM THE LOWS\nWE SAW 135 TO NUMBERS WE ARE SEEING NOW PERCENTAGE WISE IS A\nPRETTY STAGGERING MOVE. >> SO THE QUESTION IS WHEN IT\nCOMES TO BRING US BACK TO THE STOCK MARKET WHICH IS SELLING DO\nYOU BUY THE DIPS WHICH HAS BEEN THE RIGHT STRATEGY TO THIS\nPOINT? PEOPLE BLINK AND MISS THE SELL\nOFFS AND THEN WE CONTINUE TO RECOVER AND MOVE HIGHER.\nDO YOU DO THAT AGAIN OR SIT OUT AND THINK THIS TIME SOMETHING IS\nDIFFERENT. >> I'M NOT BREAKING ANY NEWS\nHERE. THE ENTIRE WAY UP I HAVE BEEN\nSKEPTICAL AND ALL ALONG I HAVE SAID MY SKEPTMISM.\nEVERY PULL OFF WE HAVE SEEN IN THE LAST SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS\nHAS BEEN A BUYING OPPORTUNITY. IS THIS GOING TO BE THE\nDIFFERENT ONE? I WISH I WAS SMART ENOUGH TO\nANSWER THAT QUESTION. I WILL SAY THE LONGER THE MARKET\nSTAYS BELOW THE 2,135 LEVEL IN THE S&P THE MORE CAUTIOUS I\nBECOME. I THINK A HUGE LEVEL WILL FIND\nITSELF AT 2050. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR CRITICAL\nSUPPORT THAT IS WHERE IT COMES. IF YOU CONTINUE TO SEE THESE\nPRETTY AMAZING MOVES IN BOND MARKETS GLOBALLY AGAIN THAT\nUNCERTAINTY DOESN'T LEND ITSELF TO A STABLE STOCK MARKET IN MY\nOPINION. >> IT WAS INTERESTING THIS\nHAPPENED ON A DAY -- THIS IS MUCH-ANTICIPATED EVENT OF THE\nWEEKEND. SHE WAS DOVISH WHICH IS CONTRARY\nTO WHAT WAS BUILT UP TO BE. SHE COMES OUT AND INSTEAD HAS A\nVERY DOVISH MESSAGE. IS THAT LOST?\nDO PEOPLE NOT CARE? DOES IT NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO\nWITH WHY BONDS ARE SELLING -- >> I THINK IT WAS A FACTOR\nYESTERDAY TO THE REBOUND. I THINK TODAY WE WOKE UP TO THE\nWALL STREET SAYING YOU HAVE A CONFLICTED FED NOT LIKELY TO\nMOVE IN SEPTEMBER. IF I'M JUST TRYING TO PUT THE\nMARKET ON THE COUCH A LITTLE BIT IT DEFINITELY FEEDS INTO THE\nIDEA THAT HAS BEEN BUILDING UP THAT CENTRAL BANKS ARE FATIGUED.\nTHEY DON'T THINK THE MARGINAL ADVANTAGE OF DOING ANYTHING MORE\nTHAN THEY HAVE DONE IS REALLY THERE.\nSO THAT IS TO ME WHERE IT FITS IN.\nNOT SO MUCH RATES ARE GOING UP ON US BUT WE JUST DON'T KNOW.\nI THINK STOCKS NEED A NEW STORY IF THEY ARE GOING TO GO HIGHER.\nIT IS NOT JUST ABOUT LOWER FOR LONGER.\n>> GOOD PLACE TO SWITCH GEARS. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.\n>> LATER. >> THERE IS MUCH MORE COMING UP\nAT FAST. CARL ICAHN WILL BE TALKING\nEVERYTHING FROM THE ECONOMY TO FED AND MARKETS.\nTHAT WILL BE HAPPENING WITHIN THE NEXT HOUR.\nBILL MILLER SPOKE EARLIER TODAY SHARING HIS BEST IDEA FOR THE\nMARKET. HE SAID HE IS LONG THE S&P AND\nSHORT TEN YEAR. WITH US TO EXPLAIN WHY IS BILL\nMILLER, CHAIRMAN AND CIO OF LMN, LLC.\nWELCOME. ASSUMING YOU HEARD SOME\nCONVERSATION WE WERE HAVING EXPLAIN THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE\nFED AND HAVING CONFIDENCE IN THE FED OR ANTICIPATING THEIR NEXT\nMOVES FITS IN WITH YOUR BEST IDEA HERE TO GO LONG STOCKS AND\nSHORT BONDS. >> BEING SHORT BONDS HAS BEEN A\nTERRIBLE TRADE FOR THE LAST 35 YEARS.\nI THINK THAT RIGHT NOW IT'S PROBABLY A GOOD TIME TO PUT THAT\nTRADE ON. AND THE REASON I SAY THAT IS\nTHAT YOU ARE IN A PERIOD NOW WHERE INTEREST RATES ARE ABOUT\nAS LOW AS THEY ARE GOING TO GO. WE HAVE SEEN A BACK UP IN GLOBAL\nYIELDS. MAYBE MOST IMPORTANTLY WE HAD AN\nINTERESTING THING TODAY HAPPEN WHICH IS FOR MOST OF THIS YEAR\nWHENEVER STOCKS SOLD OFF BONDS HAVE RALLIED.\nWE HAVE SEEN STOCKS SELLING OFF AND BONDS SELLING OFF.\n>> AND SO PAUL SINGER'S POINT WAS IF BOTH STOCK AND BOND\nPRICES ROSE TOGETHER DURING RECOVERY NOW THEY CAN BOTH FOLD\nTOGETHER. THAT MIGHT BE WHAT WE ARE\nSEEING. YOUR POINT OF VIEW YOU ARE\nSAYING BOND PRICES WILL FALL BUT YOU KEEP BUYING STOCKS.\n>> I THINK OVERALL VALUATIONS WHILE HIGH COMPARED TO HISTORIC\nNORMS THOSE NORMS WERE PERIODS WHERE AVERAGE BOND YIELD IS\nABOUT 6%. AVERAGE BOND YIELD IS 1.7% AND\nHAVE DIVIDEND GROWTH RATE AND WE CAN FIND REALLY GOOD VALUE IN\nTHE MARKET SHORT TERM CORRECTIONS IN THE MARKET REALLY\nI THINK ARE NOT TO BE TOO CONCERNED ABOUT.\n>> WHY IS THAT? MAKE THE CASE FOR SOMEBODY WHO\nHAS BEEN LISTENING TO THE TALK OF DELIVERING ALPHA OR\nCONTEMPLATING THIS MOVE WITH THE BOND MARKET AND SAYING IF YIELDS\nARE GOING HIGHER THAN STOCK PRICES MUST HAVE TO FALL LOWER\nAND MAYBE BE RE-VALUED. WHY DO YOU WANT TO BE LONG\nSTOCKS IN THIS ENVIRONMENT? >> I THINK IT IS A VALUATION\nCALL. IF YOU GO BACK 30 YEARS TO 1987\nSO SEPTEMBER 1987 THE MONTH BEFORE THE MARKET CRASHED YOU\nHAVE THE EXACT OPPOSITE SITUATION WHERE YIELDS HAVE BEEN\nRISING BUT STOCKS WERE CONTINUING TO RISE AND THE FED\nHAD BEEN TIGHTENING. THE 30-YEAR TREASURY YOU GOT TO\n10% IN OCTOBER OF '87. AND YET WHAT YOU HAD WAS STOCK\nMARKET GOES AROUND 18 TIMES EARNINGS AND WITH 3% YIELD.\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT STOCKS VERSUS BONDS IT MADE NO SENSE BECAUSE\nYOU HAVE 3% IN STOCKS AND DIVIDEND YIELD AND 5% GROWTH\nRATE WHICH MEANT YOU CAN ONLY MAKE 8% IN STOCKS WHERE TREASURY\nGAVE YOU 9% FOR 30 YEARS. SO THE VALUATION CASE WAS\nCOMPELLING. RIGHT NOW IT IS THE EXACT\nOPPOSITE WHICH IS IT IS HARD TO SEE.\nI THINK THE BOND MARKET MADE A DOUBLE TOP ONE IN 2012 AND THE\nOTHER JULY OF THIS YEAR. BONDS AROUND 135 LEVEL WITH BOND\nYIELDS THE LOWEST IN HISTORY AND STOCK VALUATIONS ARE CERTAINLY\nNOT DEMANDING COMPARED TO BONDS. IT IS VERY EASY TO SEE HOW A\nDECENT -- LONG TERM IT IS HARD TO SEE HOW IF YOU THREW A DART\nAND JUST CONTINUE TO HOLD IT YOU WILL GET 4% OR 5% GROWTH RATE IN\nDIVIDENDS. THAT WILL HAVE TO KILL BONDS.\n>> WHAT IS YOUR ANTICIPATION HERE?\nIS THIS PREDICATED ON THEY ARE GOING TO KEEP RAISING RATES?\nAT THIS POINT DOES IT MATTER WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY PULL A 180\nAND SAY FORGET IT? >> YOU KNOW, I THINK AT THE END\nOF THE DAY THE CENTRAL BANKS AROUND THE WORLD AT LEAST IN A\nRETHINK ABOUT THE ABILITY OF LOWER RATES TO MAKE ANY\nDIFFERENCE IN THE OVERALL ECONOMY.\nWHAT WE HAVE NOW IS THERE IS A MUCH DIMINISHED MARGIN OF\nUTILITY. THERE AREN'T PROJECTS ON HOLD\nBECAUSE RATES ARE TOO HIGH. WHAT IS HAPPENING IS IT IS\nPUTTING PRESSURE ON THE BANKING SYSTEM AND RAISING PRESENT VALUE\nOF LIABILITIES AND I DO THINK MAYBE MOST IMPORTANTLY THE U.S.\nECONOMY IS CHUGGING ALONG AT 1.5% TO 2%.\nTHAT IS FAST ENOUGH TO BRING DOWN THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE.\nWE ARE APPROACHING FULL EMPLOYMENT.\nYOU JUST -- ALL OF THAT WOULD TEND TO SAY YOU DON'T NEED\nEXTRAORDINARY ACCOMMODATION. REMOVING ACCOMMODATION SOME CALL\nIT TIGHTENING. AND I DOENGT HU IT CAUSES A LOT\nOF PROBLEMS FOR THE STOCK MARKET EXCEPT NEAR TERM AS MONEY GETS\nREALLOCATED. UNDERLYING VALUES DON'T REALLY\nCHANGE. >> MIKE SANTOLI.\nTHE FED CALLS IT REMOVAL OF ACCOMMODATION.\nIT SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE. TO YOUR POINT THAT YOU MENTIONED\nIN THE SHORT TERM WHEN YOU HAVE MARKETS ADJUSTING TO GENERAL\nRISE IN BOND YIELDS AS TREASURY MARKET PERHAPS SELLS OFF FURTHER\nOR TO THE FED DOING WHAT IT IS GOING TO DO.\nWHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR IN THAT ADJUSTMENT PROCESS?\nWHAT KINDS OF STOCKS SHOULD PERFORM WELL IN THAT\nENVIRONMENT? IS THAT WHAT TRADITIONAL GROWTH\nIS GOING TO DO BETTER? WHAT ARE YOU FINDING THAT IS\nCOMPELLING? FOR EXAMPLE, THOSE DEPENDENT ON\nTHE CREDIT MARKET, ARE THEY GOING TO BE OKAY, AS WELL?\n>> WE TEND NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT IN THE SENSE OF GROWTH DOING\nBETTER OR VALUE DOING BETTER. WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR IS WHERE\nPRICES OF INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES CHANGE FAR MORE THAN WARRANTED\nBY CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES OR DROP IN THE OVERALL MARKET.\nWE ARE TRYING TO LOOK FOR DISLOCATION AND VALUEUATION\nACROSS THE BOARD. IF THE YIELD CURVE IS SHIFTING\nUP THEN THAT IS GOOD FOR BANKS AND FINANCIALS AND CREDIT\nSENSITIVE NAMES. BUT BROADLY SPEAKING IT WOULD\nTEND TO BE GOOD FOR FINANCIALS. 100 BASIS POINT MOVE IN FED\nFUNDS RATE IS PROBABLY 4 TO $5 BILLION OF PRETAX EARNINGSISM WE\nCAN LOOK THERE. IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT LIKE A JP\nMORGAN WITH LOW PAYOUT RATIO. WE THINK THOSE CAN GROW FAR\nFASTER THAN THE MARKET. THEY ARE ABOVE MARKET.\n>> JUST A QUICK QUESTION. DO YOU HAVE -- WHAT ABOUT DEEP\nVALUE? I MENTION FINANCIALS DEUTSCHE\nBANK AT 30%. I LOOK AT THESE MORE DISTRESSED\nSITUATIONS LIKE",

IT WAS A LITTLE BETTER ABOUT AN\nHOUR AGO. BUT ESSENTIALLY COMING BACK TO\nTHE DOWNSIDE AGAIN. VOLUME IS VERY HEAVY TODAY.\nPROBABLY 4 BILLION SHARES AT THE NYSE.\nVOLATILITY HAS BEEN SPIKING AGAIN TODAY, TWO THINGS OF IT\nMATTERING, INTEREST RATES IN OIL, LOOK AT THE TEN YEAR.\nEARLIER ON DELIVERING ALPHA PULSINGER FROM L.A.

NONE OF THE OIL STOCKS HAVE DONE\nANYTHING ALL DAY. ALL BIG NAMES DOWN 2%, 3%.\nTHEY'RE ALL TRADING TOWARDS THE LOWER END OF THE RECENT RANGE IN\nTHE LAST THREE OR FOUR MONTHS. HERE IS THE S&P 500, YO-YO, AS\nWE LIKE TO CALL IT. DOWN 1.5% TODAY.\nUP 1.5% YESTERDAY, DOWN 2.5% ON FRIDAY.\nAND, MELISSA, THE GENERAL FEELING FOR THE NEXT SEVEN OR\nEIGHT DAYS UNTIL THE FED MEETING THIS IS THE KIND OF VOLATILITY\nWE'RE LIKELY TO SEE.

WHAT HAPPENED?\n>> YOU HAVE A LOT OF STRATEGIES THAT HAVE EVOLVED IN THE LAST\nSEVERAL YEARS THAT ARE ACTUALLY DEPENDENT ON VOLATILITY THAT ARE\nVOLATILITY TRADES. SO WHEN YOU GET VERY HEAVY\nVOLATILITY, A LOT OF THESE STRATEGIES HAVE TO SELL STOCKS\nOR SELL BONDS TO MAINTAIN A CERTAIN LEVEL OF VOLATILITY.\nIT IS CALLED RISK PARITY TRADE. THAT'S CONTRIBUTING TO IT.\nLOW VOLATILITY IS GREAT, THE FED IS ON YOUR SIDE, WE'LL KEEP\nTHINGS CALM, BUT HAD THEY START ACTING LIKE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO\nKEEP THINGS CALM, THAT UPSETS A LOT OF TRADING STRATEGIES.\nTHAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW.\n>> THAT'S THE CTA PART OF THE MARKET.\nIN TERMS OF WHAT RETAIL INVESTORS ARE IN, A LOT OF MONEY\nHAS BEEN POURING INTO LOW VOLATILITY FUNDS.\nSO WE'RE SEEING THESE YIELDS SPIKE, THEN UTILITIES, THEY\nDON'T LOOK AS ATTRACTIVE ON A YIELD BASIS ANYMORE.\n>> THAT'S RIGHT. LOW VOLATILITY HAS DONE VERY\nWELL. THE FED HAS ESSENTIALLY TOLD\nEVERYONE, WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO KEEP THINGS QUIET.\nWHEN THEY TRY TO CHANGE THE UPON, THAT'S WHEN THE THINGS\nREALLY FALL APART A BIT AND WE'RE SEEING THAT LOW VOLATILITY\nFUND DEFINITELY UNDER PERFORM RECENTLY.\n>> ALL RIGHT, BOB, THANK YOU. BOB PISANI.\n>> ALL RIGHT, WELL, GENERALLY WE GET A LOT OF BAD NEWS ABOUT THE\nECONOMY, NOT GROWING AS FAST AS WE WANT, LABOR FORCE\nPARTICIPATION RATE IS DOWN. GUESS WHAT, WE HAVE GOOD NEWS\nTODAY. SOMETHING IS HAPPENING TO\nAMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS THAT IS NOT HAPPENED SINCE THE FINANCIAL\nCRISIS EIGHT YEARS AGO. EAMON JAVERS.\n>> THIS IS IS ROBUST DATA, THE HOUSEHOLD INCOME DATA FROM THE\nCENSUS BUREAU. THESE ARE NUMBERS FROM 2015, AND\nIT IS A BIG ANNUAL GAIN, THE  DATA TODAY.\nIT IS THE BIGGEST ANNUAL GAIN SINCE THE CENSUS BUREAU BEGAN\nRELEASING THAT DATA BACK IN 1967.\nLOOK AT SOME OF THE INTERESTING SUBSETS OF THIS DATA, NO INCOME\nRISE, THOUGH, OUTSIDE OF METROPOLITAN AREAS.\nWOMEN WERE UP 2.7%. MEN UP 1.5%.\nAND THE 2015 RATE IS STILL 1.6% BELOW THE 2007 LEVEL.\nTHAT GIVES YOU A SENSE THAT STILL HAVE SOME GROUND TO MAKE\nUP, GOING BACK TO THE GREAT RECESSION.\nTHE LARGEST INCREASE HERE WAS IN THE BOTTOM FIFTH OF EARNERS,\nINCOMES DECLINED FOR THOSE IN THE TOP FIFTH, NONCITIZEN\nINCOMES WERE UP 10.5% TO AN AVERAGE OF $45,100.\nAND NATIVE BORN INCOMES UP 4.4%. IT IS VERY ROBUST DATA FOR\nHOUSEHOLD INCOME IN 2015 AND BEING DOWN HERE IN WASHINGTON, I\nLOOK AT THAT THROUGH A LITTLE BIT OF A POLITICAL LENS AND LOOK\nAT SOME OF THE DEMOGRAPHIC BREAKOUTS, PARTICULARLY THE\nMETROPOLITAN REGION, NONMETROPOLITAN REGION AND START\nTO WONDER, DOES THAT HAVE SOME BEARING ON THE POLITICS THAT\nWE'RE SEEING PLAYING OUT IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA RIGHT\nNOW, BRIAN. >> HOW COULD IT NOT?\n>> RIGHT. YEAH, LOOK, I MEAN, WHERE YOU\nSTAND, YOU KNOW, DEPENDS WHERE YOU SIT IN MANY CASES AND WHERE\nYOU LIVE. AND POLITICALLY WE'RE SEEING\nTHIS RURAL URBAN DIVIDE PLAYING OUT, WE'RE SEEING A TOP BOTTOM\nDIVIDE PLAYING OUT, WE'RE SEEING A CITIZEN, NONCITIZEN DIVIDE\nPLAYING OUT AND YOU DO SEE ALL THOSE DIVIDES HERE IN THE\nNUMBERS. IT WOULD TAKE A TRAINED POLLSTER\nTO GO THROUGH THEM IN MORE DETAIL THAN WE HAVE SO FAR TO\nREALLY TEASE OUT THE CONNECTIONS HERE.\nJUST ON THE SURFACE, SOME OF THESE DEMOGRAPHIC SPLITS YOU SEE\nREALLY MIRROR A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING TRENDWISE IN THE\nPOLITICAL SEASON. >> LET'S BRING IN STEVE LIESMAN\nAS WELL TO TALK MORE ABOUT THIS. STEVE, LISTEN, IT IS SORT OF\nUNCOOL TO BE POSITIVE. EVER, RIGHT?\nSPECIAL THE LAST FEW YEARS. YOU GET ATTENTION BY BEING\nNEGATIVE AND EVERYONE WANTS TO SLAM THE ECONOMY, EVERYTHING IS\nTERRIBLE ALL THE TIME. I KNOW THERE IS GOING TO ALWAYS\nBE PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING IN AMERICA.\nBUT THIS IS -- I MEAN, IS THERE ANY WAY TO SPIN THIS NEGATIVELY?\nTHIS IS FUNDAMENTALLY GOOD NEWS. >> WELL, NO, I THINK THE WAY IT\nWOULD BE SPUN NEGATIVELY IS IT HAS TAKEN A LONG TIME.\nTHAT'S, I THINK, ACKNOWLEDGED BY BOTH SIDES IN THIS DEBATE, THAT\nTHERE WAS ONE OF THE SLOWEST RECOVERIES WE HAVE HAD HAD TO\nGET INCOME BACK UP TO THE LEVELS BEFORE THE CRISIS.\nBUT WHAT IS INTERESTING IS EMAN TALKED ABOUT A POLLSTER ON THIS,\nWE DO OUR ALL AMERICA POLL AND THIS -- THESE NUMBERS HELP\nEXPLAIN SOMETHING UNIQUE WE HAVE SEEN.\nWHEN YOU ASK PEOPLE ABOUT THE OVERALL U.S. ECONOMY, THEY SAY\nIT IS TERRIBLE. THEY ALSO SAY THE POLITICAL\nSYSTEM IS TERRIBLE. WE ASK ABOUT THE PERSONAL\nFINANCIAL SYSTEM, THEY SAY IT IS PRETTY GOOD.\nA LOT OF CURRENCY GIVEN TO A SPECIFIC SET OF NUMBERS THAT\nSHOW WE HAD NEGATIVE INCOME GROWTH FROM '02 TO 2014.\nWHAT I TRIED TO COME ON AND ARGUE REPEATEDLY IS THOSE\nNUMBERS IGNORE TWO PRETTY DECENT YEARS WE THINK WE HAD HAD, 2015\nAND 16. THESE NUMBERS SHOW AT LEAST PART\nOF THAT. AND IT ALSO GETS TO THEM IN WHY\nARE DONALD TRUMP'S NUMBERS SEEM TO BE SORT OF CAPPED, AND IT MAY\nBE BECAUSE THE ECONOMIC DISSATISFACTION ONLY GOES SO FAR\nAND SOME OF IT, SOME OF IT HAS REVERSED.\n>> SO, STEVEN, YOU MADE THE POINT ABOUT PEOPLE ANSWERING ON\nAN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, THEIR SITUATION SAY, OKAY, BY WHAT\nTHEY SEE ON THE BROADER BASIS, NOT SO MUCH.\nWHY IS THAT DIVIDE AND HOW DO REGULATOR OR NOT REGULATORS,\nPOLICYMAKERS SUS THAT OUT, DIFFERENTIATE THE TWO POINTS OF\nVIEWS? >> WELL, VERY QUICKLY, I MEAN,\nIT IS A VERY COMPLICATED SITUATION.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HURT BY THINGS LIKE TRADE, THINGS\nLIKE TECHNOLOGY. AND THEY ARE SERIOUSLY\nECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED, HARD FOR THEM TO GET IT BACK, BUT\nTHERE IS ANOTHER GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE DONE WELL IN THIS\nECONOMY AND YOU SEE THAT PLAYING OUT ESSENTIALLY IN THE POLITICAL\nECONOMIC DEBATE GOING ON RIGHT NOW.\n>> ALL RIGHT, STEVE, THANKS SO MUCH.\n>>> WELL, TODAY, DELIVERING ALPHA, JIM CHANOS, THE NOTED\nSHORT SELLER, CONTINUING TO EXPRESS HIS DOUBTS OVER TESLA\nAND ITS TAKE ON ELON MUSK, OTHER",

IT DOES LOOK TO ME LIKE THEY'RE\nNOT OUT OF BULLETS, THEN THEY'RE CERTAINLY STRAINING, AND IT'S\nGOING TO BE A BIT OF A PROBLEM. I WOULD KEEP MY EYE ON THE YIELD\nAND SEE IF THAT'S GOING TO CAUSE FURTHER PRESSURE.\n>> FINALLY, WHEN DALIA REITERATES HIS LONG-TERM OPINION\nON THE DEBT CYCLE, ARE YOU CONVINCED?\n>> HE IS AN ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT MAN, BUT I'M NOT AS CONVINCED\nTHAT IT'S -- WHAT DID HE CALL IT -- A BEAUTIFUL DELEVERAGING.\nDOESN'T LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL TO ME. MAYBE BEAUTY IS IN THE EYE OF\nTHE BEHOLDER, BUT THIS LOOKS LIKE A STRUGGLE.\n>> ART, THANKS. ART CASHIN HERE.\nA LOT MORE FROM DELIVERING ALPHA, AND BACK IN JUST A\nMOMENT. DON'T GO AWAY.",

              "text": ">>> GUYS, THANKS SO MUCH.\nWELCOME TO \"THE HALFTIME REPORT.\"\nI'M SCOTT WAPNER LIFE TODAY FROM CNBC. SIXTH ANNUAL DELIVERING ALPHA\nCONFERENCE TODAY IN NEW YORK CITY.\nCARL ICAHN TO RAY DALIO ARE SHARING THEIR IDEAS RIGHT HERE.\nWITH US FOR THE HOUR JOE TERRA NOVA, JOSH BROWN, AND STEVEN\nWEISS. MARKETS, AS YOU KNOW, ARE HAVING\nA VERY DIFFICULT DAY. THE DOW HAS BEEN DOWN ABOUT 250\nPOINTS. DOW AND THE S&P LOOKING AT THEIR\nFOUR OUT OF FIVE DOWN DAYS NOW. THERE'S THE DOW DOWN CURRENTLY\n246. THE S&P AND THE NASDAQ AND THE\nRUSSELL, WHICH IS DOWN 2% TAKING A LITTLE BIT HARDER TODAY.\nGIVE YOU A CHECK ON OIL AND GOLD AND BONDS TOO.\nTHERE'S SO MUCH CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT THE FED MAY DO.\nEVEN HERE AT DELIVERING ALPHA HAVE YOU HEARD FROM SOME OF THE\nLARGEST AND MOST RESPECTED MONEY MANAGERS IN THE WORLD WITH THEIR\nCOMMENTARY ON THE FED AND THE MARKETS.\nWE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT. ALSO WORD TODAY THAT ATLANTA FED\nPRESIDENT DENNIS LOCKHART IS STEPPING DOWN FROM HIS POST IN\nFEBRUARY. THAT IS BIG NEWS.\nTHAT'S WHY WE HAVE SENIOR ECONOMICS REPORTER STEVE LIESMAN\nJOINING US ON SET AS WELL. LET'S DISCUSS WHAT'S TAKING\nPLACE IN THE MARKET. IT'S BEEN AN INTERESTING FEW\nDAYS. JOSH, VOLATILITY IS BACK, AND IT\nIS BACK IN A BIG WAY. >> NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.\nYOU HAD THESE GIANT BULLISH CANDLES EVERYWHERE YESTERDAY.\nWE HAD ERASED ALL OF THE LOSS, AND IN SOME AREAS WE WERE\nACTUALLY GAINING FROM THURSDAY NIGHT'S CLOSE.\nWHEN YOU SEE THAT KIND OF ACTION AND THEN THE NEXT DAY IT'S\nCOMPLETELY NEGATED AS THOUGH IT NEVER HAPPENED, THAT TELLS YOU\nSOMETHING BIG IS GOING ON. WE LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF THESE\nKINDS OF MINUS ONE, PLUS ONE, MINUS ONE AGAIN DAYS NEAR\nALL-TIME HIGHS. THIS HAS ONLY HAPPENED FIVE\nTIMES. I DON'T KNOW 100% WHAT IT MEANS,\nBUT WHEN YOU SEE THE TLT LOOKING AWFUL BACK INTO THE POST-BREXIT\nGAP, AND YOU SEE VAN GARDE REAL ESTATE DOWN 8.5% FROM THE HIGHS,\nYOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS AS A RATE-RELATED ADJUSTMENT BECAUSE\nTHE CUES, THE GROWTH STOCKS, ARE HANGING IN MUCH BETTER THAN THE\nYIELD PROXIES. >> IT MEANS BUCKLE UP.\nI MEAN, INVESTORS, JOE, NEED TO BUCKLE THEIR SEAT BELTS, PUT\nTHEIR SHOULDER STRAP ON. I MEAN, MAYBE IF YOU ARE A RACE\nCAR DRIVER, YOU NEED TO HARNESS IN TOO BECAUSE IT COULD GET EVEN\nMORE VOLATILE FROM HERE. >> I DESCRIBED YESTERDAY AS A\nTRADING EVENT, AND WE'VE NOW GRAVITATED TOWARDS IF YOU ARE A\nMONEY MANAGER, YOU NEED TO BE PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT'S GOING\nON TODAY. IF YOU DID NOT LIKE FRIDAY, YOU\nDO NOT LIKE TODAY. I THINK THE PROBLEM WAS WAKING\nUP THIS MORNING AT 4:30 AND LOOKING AT THE ASIAN MARKETS AND\nSEEING THEM REALLY GIVE UP THE STRONG GAMES.\nTHERE WAS NO REBOUNDS OVERSEAS. PEOPLE REALLY DON'T WANT\nEQUITIES UNLESS THEY'RE DOMESTICALLY FOCUSED.\nTHAT'S WHERE I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A PROBLEM GOING FORWARD.\nWE'RE IN A VACUUM PERIOD. THE RIGHT STRATEGY IS TO RAISE\nCASH LEVELS RIGHT NOW. YOU TAKE YOUR EQUITY HOLDINGS\nBACK. PROBABLY SOMEWHERE AROUND 20% IN\nCASH. YOU HAVE TO CLEARLY PAY\nATTENTION TODAY. AS I SAID YESTERDAY, IT WAS A\nTRADING EVENT. I THINK I MIGHT BE WRONG ABOUT\nTHAT. I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING BIGGER\nTHAT'S DEVELOPING HERE. BILL MILLER WAS ON THE STAGE\nLESS THAN FIVE MINUTES AGO SAYING THAT HIS BEST IDEA RIGHT\nNOW IS LONG THE S&P 500 AND SHORT TREASURIES.\nYET, YOU'VE HEARD OTHER OPINIONS FROM THE LIKES OF PAUL SINGER\nAND RAY DALIO PERHAPS. WE'LL HEAR FROM THEM IN A\nMOMENT. YOUR THOUGHTS FIRST.\n>> THAT WAS SURPRISING. JOSH AND I WERE BOTH STANDING\nTHERE WATCHING BILL MILLER, AND I THINK HE WERE WITH BOTH\nSURPRISED THAT THAT WAS HIS BEST IDEA TO COME OUT.\nNOT THE OTHER SIDE. NOT THE SELL BONDS SIDE, BUT THE\nS&P SIDE. I THINK WHAT PAUL SINGER CAME\nOUT AND SAID WAS MUCH MORE TYPICAL OF WHAT I HAVE HEARD IN\nMY CONVERSATION AND OTHER CONFERENCES I HAVE BEEN AT,\nWHICH IS HIS BEST IDEA WAS TAKE RISK OFF.\nSELL G-7 LONG DURATION BONDS. I'VE DONE WHAT JOE HAS\nSUGGESTED, WHICH I MENTIONED YESTERDAY.\nI'VE TAKEN CAPITAL OFF. ONE OF MY CONCERNS HAS BEEN\nCOMPLACE ENSY IN THE MARKETS, AND I THINK WE'RE SEEING THAT\nCOMPLACE ENSY COME OUT AGAIN TODAY.\nIF YOU HAD ASKED ME YESTERDAY AFTER BRAINERD CAME OUT AND\nTRIED TO THROW COLD WATER ON IT, I WONDER IF YELLIN PUT HIM UP ON\nIT OR NOT, I HAVE TAKEN DOWN MY ODDS OF A TIGHTENING LATER THIS\nMONTH. I STILL THINK IT WILL HAPPEN.\nI WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE MARKET WOULD HAVE HAD SOME\nFOLLOW-THROUGH TODAY. HOWEVER, WE'RE BACK TO THE\nCORRELATION WITH CRUDE. CRUDE SELLS OFF MEANINGFULLY\nOVER 3%, AND THE MARKET TAKES A DIVE.\nI THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO POINT TO.\nTHE OTHER THING -- I THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT -- IS THAT YOU\nCAN'T DISASSOCIATE POLITICS AND THE POLLS GETTING TIGHTER AND\nHILLARY NOW BECOMING -- YOU KNOW, THE PNEUMONIA WITH WHAT'S\nHAPPENING IN THE MARKETS. IT'S BECOMING MORE OF A REALITY.\nI THINK THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO DRIVE THE VOLATILITY AND\nCONTINUE TO DRIVE IT THROUGH ELECTIONS.\n>> WE'VE REFERENCED PAUL SINGER A COUPLE OF TIMES NOW.\nWE MIGHT AS WELL LISTEN TO THE SOUND THAT HE HAD TODAY.\nOF COURSE, THE FAMED HEDGE FUND MANAGER HAD ALREADY SAID THAT\nWE'RE IN THE MIDST OF THE BIGGEST BOND BUBBLE IN HISTORY,\nBUT HERE'S WHAT HE SAID ABOUT HOW HE VIEWS THE WORLD RIGHT\nNOW, AND A DANGEROUS ONE AT THAT.\n>> WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IS CREATED A TREMENDOUS INCREASE IN\nHIDDEN RISK. A RISK THAT INVESTORS DON'T\nEXACTLY KNOW OR HAVE FACED ABOUT THEIR HOLDINGS, AND I THINK IT'S\nA VERY DANGEROUS TIME IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND GLOBAL\nFINANCIAL MARKETS. >> THAT'S PAUL SINGER RIGHT\nTHERE. I GOT STEVE LIESMAN NEXT TO ME\nTOO. THEY BEING IN PART, THE FED.\nNOT JUST THE FED, BUT CENTRAL BANKS AROUND THE WORLD.\nTHE ACTIONS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE, IT'S JUST A DANGEROUS\nTIME RIGHT NOW GIVEN THE THREAT OF PULLING THAT AWAY.\n>> TREASURIES ARE NOT THE RISK-FREE ASSET, AND THAT\nCREATES -- >> SAFE HAVENS AREN'T SUCH.\n>> THERE'S NO SAFE IN THE HAVEN THERE OR NO HAVEN IN THE SAFE.\nIT CREATES A GROUNDLESS INVESTMENT MATRIX IN THAT ALL\nINVESTMENTS ARE JUDGED FROM THE RISK-FREE RETURN.\nIT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO KNOW IF STOCKS ARE OVER OR UNDER VALUED\nRELATIVE TO WHAT COULD BE A VERY POTENTIALLY VOLATILE MOVEMENT IN\nLONG BONDS WHEN IT COMES TO THE YIELD.\nWHAT TROUBLES ME, THOUGH, IS I THINK SINGER IS A LITTLE BIT\nMORE PESSIMISTIC THAN HE OUGHT TO BE IN THAT I THINK THAT MORE\nOR LESS, THE RETURNS ON THE TEN-YEAR ARE AT LEAST TO A 70 OR\n80% DEGREE DETERMINED BY THE MARKET.\nIF THE FED WERE TO STOP REALLY TRYING TO KEEP INTEREST RATES\nDOWN, I DON'T THINK THEY WOULD SKYROCKET TO 3%.\n>> ONE OF THE POINTS THAT HE MADE WAS THAT YOU COULD HAVE\nBOTH STOCKS AND BONDS FALLING TOGETHER, AND THAT WOULD BE A\nREVERSAL OF WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON NOW WHERE STOCKS AND BONDS HAVE\nGONE UP. >> AND THEN THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT\nCENTRAL BANK POLICIES HAVE DONE. IT HAS MADE A MONEY MANAGER VERY\nUNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE YOU ARE TAKING CORRELATIONS BACK TO\nWHERE EVERYTHING IS CLOSE TO ONE.\nEVERYTHING GOES UP TOGETHER. EVERYTHING GOES DOWN TOGETHER\nLIKE IT IS TODAY. THAT'S THE PROBLEM LOOKING\nFORWARD BECAUSE YOU LOSE THE HEDGING OPTIONS.\nIT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON TODAY IN\nOIL AND THINK ABOUT LAST WEEK. WHERE WE ARE ON THURSDAY WITH\nTHE NUMBER THEY CAME OUT AND EVERYONE SAYING, OH, LOOK AT\nOIL. THE BIGGEST DRAWDOWN SINCE 1999,\nGOING THROUGH 50. EVERYONE POSITIONED THE WRONG\nWAY. BRINGING IN THE CORRELATION TO\nONE. >> I ALWAYS PUZZLE OVER IT, ASK\nAPPROXIMATE PEOPLE SAY, OH, THEY GET IT.\nTO ME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE GREED TRADE AND THE FEAR TRADE\nARE SIMULTANEOUSLY OVERVALUED. YOU HAVE A TON OF PEOPLE WHO\nHAVE PILED INTO BONDS IN PART BECAUSE THEY'RE SCARED OF\nSTOCKS, THEY'RE SCARED OF THE FUTURE.\nTHEY'RE LOOKING FOR A RISK-FREE ASSET.\nAS A RESULT, THEY'VE CREATED A NON-RISK-FREE ASSET, AND VERY\nFEW PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO GO WITH THE STOCKS.\n>> I DON'T KNOW IF I AGREE IT'S A NONRISK-FREE ASSET.\nWHEN PEOPLE USE THE BLANKET TERM TREASURIES, WHAT ARE WE TALKING\nABOUT? T-BILLS ARE ACTING AS A RISK-OFF\nRIGHT NOW. THEY'RE DOING THEIR JOB.\nIF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 20-YEAR PLUS, NO, YOU SHOULDN'T EXPECT\nTHAT TO BE THE RISK-FREE IF, IN FACT, LONG-TERM BOND YIELDS ARE\nAT THE FOCAL POINT OF WHAT PEOPLE ARE PANICKING OVER.\n>> LET'S MAKE IT ACTIONABLE THEN.\nIF YOU CAN'T INVEST IN STOCKS BECAUSE THEY LOOK EXPENSIVE AND\nTHEY COULD GO DOWN IF THE FED HIKES AND YOU MAY NOT WANT TO\nINVEST IN BONDS BECAUSE YOU ARE AFRAID THAT THEY GO DOWN AND\nRATES COULD GO UP IF THE FED HIKES, WHAT DO YOU DO?\n>> YOU ENDURE -- LISTEN, YOU ENDURE SOME DEGREE OF SHORT-TERM\nVOLATILITY. IT'S THE ONLY ANSWER.\nTHE OTHER ANSWER IS YOU TRY TO MARKET TIME WITHIN AN ENTIRE\nPORTFOLIO, WHICH YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO.\n>> ONE OF THE THINGS YOU CAN DO IS YOU COULD PLAY FOR VOLATILITY\nTO INCREASE, BUT, AGAIN, THE THING THAT IS MAKING EVERYONE\nUNCOMFORTABLE RIGHT NOW IS AS A MONEY MANAGER, HOW DO YOU LAY\nOFF YOUR RISK? THAT'S THE FIRST MANDATE YOU\nHAVE WHEN YOU ARE MANAGING MONEY.\nYOU ANALYZE YOUR RISK. HOW DO I LAY OFF MY RISK?\nTHAT'S THE CHALLENGE FOR YOU RIGHT NOW BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DO\nIT USING THE HISTORICAL ASSET CLASSES.\nYOU CAN'T DO IT LAYING OFF ON THE CURRENCY MARKET OR LAYING IT\nOFF IN TREASURIES. YOU CAN LOOK AT VOLATILITY RIGHT\nNOW. >> IT ALSO DEPENDS WHAT YOUR\nBASIS IS, TAX BASIS IS. YOU CAN'T GO TO CASH IF YOU HAVE\nA LOW TAX BASIS AND PAY TAXES. FOR NEW CAPITAL, I COULD WAIT\nFOR -- >> I WANT TO REPRESENT BECAUSE\nWHAT SCOTT LEFT OUT OF HIS EQUATION THERE, WHICH HAS TO BE\nPART OF THE CONVERSATION IS YOU CAN'T GO INTO STOCKS BECAUSE --\nYOU ALSO CAN'T BE IN CASH. YOU LOST ALL OF THE RETURN.\nLET ME EXPLAIN. THIS IS IMPORTANT.\nFOR EIGHT OR NINE YEARS IF YOU HAD THIS PESSIMISTIC VIEW ON HOW\nIT WAS ALL GOING TO END UP WITH THE FED, YOU LOST A LOT OF\nMONEY. YOU ARE WELL BEHIND THE CURVE\nBECAUSE OF THAT REAL FEAR THAT YOU HAD, AND I THINK THAT\nREMAINS AN ISSUE. >> THIS CONVERSATION IS NOT\nABOUT SHOULD YOU GO INTO EQUITIES.\nIT'S IF YOU ARE IN EQUITIES, WHAT DO YOU DO NOW?\nMOST OF OUR VIEWERS AND MOST OF THOSE HERE TODAY, THEY'RE FULLY\nINVESTED IN EQUITIES THEY'VE BEEN ENJOYING THIS SEVEN-YEAR\nRIDE HIGHER. WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THAT?\n>> THERE ARE THOSE -- ON THAT POINT I WAS GOING TO SAY PEOPLE\nLIKE CARL ICAHN AND THIS WHOLE NOTION OF TINA.\nTHERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE. HIS THING IS THAT'S MALARKEY.\nYOU COULD BE IN CASH. BEING IN CASH IN A LOW RATE\nENVIRONMENT IS BETTER THAN LOSING IN EQUITY.\nIF THE MARKET IS GOING TO HAVE AN ASYMMETRIC DISLOCATION, THEN\nBEING IN CASH IS OKAY. >> THE MAJORITY OF INVESTORS\nALREADY AGREE TO THAT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT FLOWS, WHEN YOU\nLOOK AT WHERE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES, FINANCIAL\nADVISORS, PLANNERS, WHERE ARE THEY ALLOCATING, THEY'RE NOT\nTHROWING MONEY AT THE SPY. THEY'RE IN VARIOUS STRATA OF\nBOND PRODUCTS. PRIME FUNDS, SHORT-TERM\nTREASURIES, ET CETERA. NOBODY THINKS NOW IS THE TIME TO\nBE 100% STOCKS. >> THERE'S NO SIZE FITS ALL.\nIT DEPENDS ON YOUR AGE, YOUR RISK TOLERANCE, YOUR VOLATILITY\nTOLERANCE. >> LET ME GET TO THE OTHER NEWS\nOF THE DAY, AS IF IT'S AN AFTERTHOUGHT, WHICH IT'S NOT,\nAND THAT'S DENNIS LOCKHART. >> THIS IS A PROFOUND\nCONVERSATION. THIS REALLY GETS AT THE HEART OF\nTHE QUANDRY OF INVESTMENT. PART OF BEING A D.A. HERE --\n>> LOCKHART IS LEAVING IN FEBRUARY.\n>> LOCKHART IS LEAVING IN FEBRUARY.\nHE IS A CENTRIST ON THE BOARD. ONE OF THE FEW NON-ECONOMISTS\nOUT THERE. THERE'S NO TIMETABLE TO APPOINT\nHIM. WE'RE GOING TO LEARN A LITTLE\nBIT MORE ABOUT THE PROCESS IN OCTOBER.\nI GUESS IT'S A COUPLE OF WEEKS FROM NOW.\nLOCKHART HAS BEEN AT THE FED SINCE 2007.\nHE IS A GUY I HAVE KNOWN FOR A VERY LONG TIME.\nA GUY WHO YOU FOLLOW WHEN YOU WANT TO KNOW IF IT'S A CLOSE\nDECISION. IF DENNIS IS LEANING TOWARDS A\nHIKE, IT'S LIKELY GOING TO BE A HIKE BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE A",

JOINING ME NOW SAM SEDER.\nI FOUND THIS SORT OF DEPLORABLE STATEMENT, I LIKE THE FACT THAT\nPENCE SAYS I WON'T USE THAT WORD BECAUSE IT VALIDATES WHAT SHE\nSAID, WHICH IS, OF COURSE, THE POINT.\n>> YEAH. WELL, THAT'S NOT THE ONLY WORD\nIN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE THAT YOU CAN USE TO DESCRIBE AN AVOWED\nRACIST, RIGHT? HE COULD SAY REPREHENSIBLE,\nDESPICABLE. LOOK, IT'S VERY HARD TO BUY MIKE\nPENCE'S ARGUMENT THAT HE THINKS NAME CALLING IS SO DESTRUCTIVE\nTO THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN THIS COUNTRY BASED UPON WHOSE\nTICKET HE'S ON.

HE SAID -- THINGS HE SAID SR.\nPROTOTYPE RACIST, BUT HE'S NOT DRAWING THAT CONNECTION.\nAND THERE'S A REASON WHY HE DOES THAT.\nTHAT'S BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP'S VOTERS ARE PAUL RYAN'S VOTERS\nAND THERE'S A REASON WHY MIKE PENCE WON'T SAY THAT ABOUT DAVID\nDUKE BECAUSE DAVID DUKE'S PEOPLE ARE MIKE PENCE VOTERS.\n>> THERE'S TWO THINGS HAPPENING HERE.\nONE LEVEL YOU'RE SEEING REAL PARTISAN SORTING HAPPENING.\nTHE POLLS SHOW IT. CLINTON'S AND TRUMP'S NUMBERS\nARE GOING UP TO NORMAL LEVELS WITH THEIR PARTY.\nREPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS.

THEY ALWAYS WERE, RIGHT?\nBUT ALL OF THE DISTANCING FROM TRUMP HAS ESSENTIALLY GONE AWAY.\nAND SO THE QUESTION OF LIKE HOW THIS ENDS UP AFFECTING THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY AS A BRAND BECOMES PRETTY INTERESTING.\nBECAUSE IT USED TO BE, OH, THERE'S TRUMP AND THEN THERE'S\nTHE OKAY REPUBLICANS.

AND ON THAT NOTE I AM JOINED BY\nOUR POLITICAL PANEL. DAVID CHALIAN AND REBECCA BURKE.\nI'M NOT GOING TO ASK YOU TO WEIGH IN ON GOVERNOR PERRY'S\nWHATEVER YOU CALL THAT. DAVID, LET ME ASK YOU, PRESIDENT\nOBAMA, IN PHILLY TODAY, IN PENNSYLVANIA.\nPENNSYLVANIA, A STATE THAT HAS NOT VOTED FOR A REPUBLICAN FOR\nPRESIDENT SINCE 1988. DOES THE FACT THAT HE WENT TO\nPENNSYLVANIA SUGGEST THAT THAT STATE IS IN PLAY?\n>> WELL, IT DEFINITELY SUGGESTS THAT.\nTHERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. ALSO, WHERE HE WENT SPECIFICALLY\nIN PHILADELPHIA IS WITH A TASK AT HAND BECAUSE THERE ARE\nCERTAIN PARTS OF THE OBAMA COALITION THAT RIGHT NOW HILLARY\nCLINTON IS UNDERPERFORMING WITH IN A LOT OF BATTLE GROUND STATE\nPOLLS. SPECIFICALLY WITH LATINOS AND\nYOUNG PEOPLE. SO GOING TO A MINORITY HEAVY\nCOMMUNITY LIKE PHILADELPHIA WHERE IT ALSO HAS A LOT OF YOUNG\nPEOPLE, HE IS THERE TO ACTUALLY TURN OUT THE COALITION.\nBUT MORE BROADLY TO PENNSYLVANIA AND YOUR POINT, I THINK\nPENNSYLVANIA MAY END UP BEING ONE OF THE KEYS TO THIS\nELECTION. DONALD TRUMP'S PATH, AS WE'VE\nTALKED ABOUT, IT IS NARROW. IT'S A TOUGH CLIMB TO GET --\n>> HE HAS TO RUN THE TABLE REALLY.\n>> HE DOES. PENNSYLVANIA IS A TRIGGER FOR\nHIM. IF HE CAN'T MAKE AN INROAD THERE\nAND ACTUALLY CONVERT THAT STATE, HIS ABILITY TO GET TO 270\nBECOMES MUCH MORE COMPLICATED. HE HAS TO PUT LIKE SEVEN OTHER\nREALLY COMPETITIVE STATES ON HIS SIDE.\nPENNSYLVANIA, IF HE CAN WOO IT TO HIS SIDE, OPENS UP A PATH TO\n270. >> I AGREE IT'S KEY.\nHE IS GOING THERE THIS EVENING TO PRESENT HIS PLAN FOR PAID\nMATERNITY LEAVE. REBECCA, I WONDER, OTHER\nREPUBLICANS IN THE PAST, EVERYONE ALWAYS TALKS ABOUT\nGOING AFTER PENNSYLVANIA THE SAME WAY DEMOCRATS ALWAYS TALK\nABOUT MISSOURI. AND AT THE END OF THE DAY,\nTHREE, FOUR WEEKS OUT I THINK HE MEANS IT.\nMR. TRUMP I THINK WILL BE CAMPAIGNING THERE UNTIL THE VERY\nEND. >> THE REASON HE IS DOING FAIRLY\nWELL IN PENNSYLVANIA AND MAYBE BETTER THAN WE WOULD EXPECT IS\nBECAUSE, AS YOU KNOW, THE WHITE WORKING CLASS -- THERE IS A\nHIGHER PROPORTION THAN IN OTHER STATES.\nTHAT'S WHY TRUMP IS DOING WELL IN IOWA WHICH OBAMA WON BY FIVE\nPOINTS IN 2012. BECAUSE HE WAS ABLE TO WIN OVER\nTHE WHITE WORKING CLASS IN A WAY HILLARY CLINTON IS NOT.\nDONALD TRUMP IS COMPLETELY CONSOLIDATING THIS DEMOGRAPHIC.\nIN STATES WITH A HIGHER PROPORTION OF WHITE WORKING\nCLASS, A LOWER PROPORTION OF COLLEGE-EDUCATED VOTERS, HE HAS\nA REALLY GOOD CHANCE. WITH THE NEW MESSAGE HE IS\nLOOKING TO BRING NEW VOTERS IN HIS FOLD.\nSUBURBAN WHITE WOMEN. WITH THE PAID MATERNITY PUSH.\nIT'S NOT A CONVENTIONAL REPUBLICAN POSITION.\nIT'S ONE SOME OF TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS IN THE PAST LIKE\nLAURA INGRAM AND SEAN HANNITY HAVE MOCKED.\n>> IT'S A DEMOCRAT POSITION, BASICALLY TO HAVE SIX WEEKS PAID\nMATERNITY LEAVE FOR MOMS. DAVID, LET ME ASK YOU, THE\nATTEMPT TO GO AROUND THE COLLAR OF PHILADELPHIA AND WINNING OVER\nTHE MOMS. WHEN MIKE PENCE REFUSES TO USE\nTHE WORD \"DEPLORABLE\" TO TALK ABOUT DAVID DUKE AND IT COMES IN\nTHE CONTEXT OF A LOT OF RATHER DEPLORABLE PEOPLE BEING VERY\nVOCAL TRUMP SUPPORTERS, NOT A MAJORITY, NOT HALF, BUT A LOT OF\nTHEM. AND I JUST WONDERED, DOES THAT\nHURT THAT ATTEMPT TO GO INTO THE COLLAR, TO GO INTO MONTGOMERY\nCOUNTY AND THE OTHER SUBURBS OUTSIDE PHILLY AND TO OTHER\nWOMEN? >> IT'S WHY WE SEE -- YOU KNOW,\nWHEN DONALD TRUMP WAS OUT COURTING THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nVOTE, GOING -- YOU REMEMBER HE WENT TO MICHIGAN, HE WENT TO\nOTHER PLACES. EVEN THOUGH HE WAS TALKING TO\nLARGELY WHITE CROWDS INITIALLY BEFORE THE DETROIT TRIP, HE WAS\nTALKING ABOUT HIS WOOING OF THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE AND HOW\nWELL HE THOUGHT -- WE TALKED THEN, IT WASN'T ABOUT JUST\nTRYING TO DIG INTO HILLARY CLINTON'S ENORMOUS ADVANTAGE\nWITH AFRICAN-AMERICANS. PART OF THAT WAS TO APPEAL TO\nWHITE SUBURBANITES AS A MORE TOLERANT PERSON THAN THEY THINK\nHE IS. THAT HE IS WILLING TO DO THE\nOUTREACH. THAT WAS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF\nWHAT HE WAS DOING. WHEN MIKE PENCE DOESN'T WANT TO\nUSE THE WORD \"DEPLORABLE\" AND WON'T USE THAT AND SAY DAVID\nDUKE IS DEPLORABLE AND THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN MAKES HAY OF\nTHAT, THE FIRST PLACE THAT WILL BE FELT IS IN THESE SUBURBAN\nAREAS. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN PEOPLE WHO\nMAY BE ON THE FENCE, IF THEY THINK THE TRUMP/PENCE CAMPAIGN\nIS TOLERANT OF THIS HATRED, IT BECOMES A HUGE TURNOFF.\n>> YOU DON'T WANT TO USE THE SAME WORD AS HILLARY CLINTON.\nWHY NOT JUST SAY IT'S DISGUSTING, RACIST, I HATE IT, I\nDON'T WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO IT.\nWE'VE SEEN THIS DONALD TRUMP RETWEETING WHITE SUPREMACISTS,\nPEOPLE WITH THE NAME \"WHITE GENOCIDE\" IN THEIR HANDLE.\nEXPLAIN TO ME WHAT YOU THINK IS GOING ON.\n>> IT'S A LITTLE CONFUSING BECAUSE MIKE PENCE WILL GO OUT\nTHERE AND SAY WE DON'T WANT HIS SUPPORT, WE DON'T WANT THE\nSUPPORT OF PEOPLE WHO THINK THE WAY THAT DAVID DUKE THINKS.\nBUT THEN GOING ONE STEP FURTHER TO SAY DEPLORABLE IS A LINE HE\nWON'T CROSS. PART OF THIS CALCULATION, I\nTHINK, IS THAT THEY RECOGNIZE THEIR CORE SUPPORTERS ARE\nCOMPRISED, IN PART, BY THESE ALT-RIGHT PEOPLE, BUT PEOPLE WHO\nHAVE THESE WHITE NATIONALIST VIEWS.\nAND THEY DON'T WANT TO TURN OFF ANY CORE SUPPORTERS IN THE LAST\n55 DAYS OF THIS ELECTION. BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO JUST AN\nADMISSION BY THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN THAT THIS IS NOT TURF THAT'S\nFAVORABLE TO THEM. THEY WANT TO MOVE THE\nCONVERSATION IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION.\nTHAT'S WHY I AM REALLY INTERESTED BY THIS TACTIC,\nFOCUSING ON THE BASKET OF DEPLORABLES COMMENT.\nBECAUSE TRUMP SEEMS TO THINK THAT THIS IS A GOOD -- IT'S A\nGOOD PIECE OF TURF FOR HIM, THAT HE CAN ENERGIZE HIS SUPPORTERS,\nSAY HILLARY CLINTON WAS INSULTING YOU, GET THEM RILED UP\nA LITTLE BIT. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THEN THE\nCONVERSATION IS, HOW MANY OF TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS ARE IN THE\nBASKET OF DEPLORABLES? >> IT'S NOT HALF.\nIS IT A THIRD, A QUARTER? >> AS YOU SAID, THEY HAVE\nDISAVOWED DAVID DUKE. DONALD TRUMP HAS DONE IT ON\nMULTIPLE OCCASIONS. YOUR INTERVIEW WITH HIM BACK IN\nFEBRUARY, IT WAS, I GUESS, WAS THE KICKOFF OF THAT NO DOUBT.\nBUT THEY HAVE DISAVOWED IT AS YOU'VE SAID.\nTHEY SAY WE ARE NOT INTERESTED IN THE SUPPORTERS.\nI THINK IT'S A PURE POLITICAL. THEY WANT THE WORD \"DEPLORABLE\"\nTO BE COMPLETELY OWNED BY HILLARY CLINTON NOW BECAUSE OF\nHER MISTAKE. >> TUNE INTO CNN TOMORROW NIGHT\nAT 9:00 P.M.

SHE SAID THAT AT THE TIME HALF\nOF THE PEOPLE SUPPORTING DONALD TRUMP AND I WERE IRREDEEMABLE,\nWERE NOT AMERICAN AND, FRANKLY, I'VE NEVER HEARD A MAJOR PARTY\nCANDIDATE IN THE UNITED STATES SPEAK ABOUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\nWITH SUCH CONTEMPT. I'M OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL\nEVERY DAY. I'M CAMPAIGNING WITH DONALD\nTRUMP AND FOR DONALD TRUMP. AND WHAT HILLARY CLINTON\nAPPARENTLY DOESN'T KNOW IS THE PEOPLE SUPPORTING THIS CAMPAIGN\nARE HARD-WORKING AMERICANS WHO COME OUT TO OUR RALLIES, STOP US\nIN DINERS, VISIT WITH US AT MEETINGS AT FACTORIES.\nTHEY'RE PEOPLE THAT WORK WITH THEIR HANDS.\nTHEY'RE PEOPLE WHO RUN BUSINESSES.\nTHEY'RE VETERANS. LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.\nMOMS AND DADS AND FORMERS. FOR HILLARY CLINTON TO EXPRESS\nSUCH DISDAIN FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICANS I THINK IS ONE MORE\nREASON THAT DISQUALIFIED HER TO SERVE IN THE HIGHEST OFFICE OF\nTHE LAND. ANYONE WHO HAS THAT LOW AN\nOPINION OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SHOULD NEVER SERVE AS PRESIDNT\nOF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AS I SAID THIS WEEKEND, I'LL SAY\nAGAIN, DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTERS ARE NOT A BASKET OF ANYTHING.\nTHEY ARE AMERICANS AND THEY DESERVE THE RESPECT OF THE\nDEMOCRAT NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nDONALD TRUMP I SAID HIS AMBITION IS TO BE PRESIDENT OF ALL THE\nPEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\nAS HE SAID THIS WEEKEND, WE BELIEVE FROM OUR HEART, EVEN\nTHOUGH WHO DID NOT SUPPORT US, EVEN THOSE WHO ARE CRITICAL OF\nUS OR HAVE STRONGLY DIFFERENT VIEWS HAVE OUR RESPECT BECAUSE\nTHEY ARE AMERICANS AND WE RESPECT THEIR RIGHT TO THEIR\nVIEWS AND IT WOULD BE THE HIGHEST HONOR OF OUR LIFE TO\nSERVE THEM. NOW, WITH REGARD TO YOUR\nQUESTION, I WILL TELL YOU, A QUESTION I CONTINUE TO -- FOR\nALL THE WORLD, I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THIS MAN KEEPS COMING UP.\nI MEAN, DONALD TRUMP AND I HAVE DENOUNCED DAVID DUKE REPEATEDLY.\nWE HAVE SAID THAT WE DO NOT WANT HIS SUPPORT.\nAND WE DO NOT WANT THE SUPPORT OF PEOPLE WHO THINK LIKE HIM.\nAND YESTERDAY I WAS -- I WAS ASKED A QUESTION ABOUT THAT.\nI REPEATED THAT AGAIN. AND THE SIMPLE FACT IS I'M NOT\nIN THE NAME CALLING BUSINESS. MY COLLEAGUES KNOW I BELIEVE\nCIVILITY IS ESSENTIAL. I'M ALSO NOT GOING TO VALIDATE\nTHE LANGUAGE THAT HILLARY CLINTON USED TO DESCRIBE THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE. I MEAN, LOOK, MILLIONS OF\nAMERICANS KNOW AND FRANKLY YOU ALL KNOW HILLARY CLINTON WASN'T\nTALKING ABOUT THAT BAD MAN. SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE ALL\nACROSS THIS COUNTRY. WHO ARE COMING OUT IN RECORD\nNUMBERS TO STAND BY DONALD TRUMP AND TO STAND WITH HIM IN HIS\nVISION TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.\nWE'LL CALL ON HER AGAIN. TO APOLOGIZE AND RETRACT HER\nCOMMENTS. THE ONLY THING SHE SAID SO FAR\nIS SHE WAS WRONG ABOUT THE MATH I GUESS AND SHE'S SORRY SHE SAID\nHALF. THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS HER\nREMARKS WERE DEEPLY INSULTING TO SINCERE PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THIS\nCOUNTRY WHO KNOW WE CAN DO BETTER WHO KNOW WE CAN BE\nSTRONGER, AND WE CALL ON HILLARY CLINTON AND HER CAMPAIGN ONCE\nAGAIN TO FULLY RETRACT THOSE OFFENSE ITCH STATEMENTS AND\nAPOLOGIZE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AS SHE SHOULD.\n>> GOVERNOR, DO YOU HAVE ANY CONCERNS THAT -- WHETHER IT'S\nDAVID DUKE OR OTHERS WHO HOLD VIEWS THAT ARE CONSIDERED RACIST\nOR MISOGYNIST OR ANY OF THOSE THINGS, THAT THEY ARE ATTRACTED\nTO YOUR CAMPAIGN AND WANT TO ATTACH THEMSELVES TO YOU?\nAGAIN TODAY DAVID DUKE TALKED ABOUT YOU SPECIFICALLY.\nARE YOU CONCERNED THAT THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE TRUMP/PENCE\nCANDIDACY IN THESE POLITICAL TIMES AND THE RHETORIC THAT'S\nBEEN USED THAT DRAWS THEM TO YOU?\n>> LOOK, WE LIVE IN A FREE COUNTRY AND PEOPLE OF ILL\nMOTIVES CAN ASSOCIATE THEMSELVES WITH POLITICS.\nI WOULD DRAW NO MORE CONCLUSION OF THAT MAN'S EX-EXPRESSIONS OF\nSUPPORT THAN I WOULD THE FACT THAT THE FATHER OF A TERRORIST\nWHO KILLED 49 AMERICANS WAS SEEN AT A HILLARY CLINTON RALLY\nCHEERING HER ON AND SAID HE WAS THERE BECAUSE SHE WAS IF ON\nNATIONAL SECURITY. I MEAN, LOOK, FOLKS, THERE ARE\nTWO PEOPLE ON THE BALLOT HERE. HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD\nTRUMP. ONE OF THEM IS GOING TO BE\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\nAND I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU THIS IS ALL A DISTRACTION.\nI GET IT. I UNDERSTAND WHY HILLARY CLINTON\nAND HER CAMPAIGN WANT TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT AFTER THAT SPEECH ON\nFRIDAY NIGHT. WE ALL HAVE RECOGNIZED.\nYOU IN THE MEDIA HAVE VRECOGNIZD THIS WAS A CATASTROPHIC INSULT\nTO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT\nPEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY KNOW THIS WAS A PREPARED SPEECH.\nTHIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME SHE CALLED MILLIONS OF AMERICANS A\nBASKET OF DEPLORABLES.

WE HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP\nWITH THE NCAA IT AND DONALD TRUMP AND I SIMPLY BELIEVE THAT\nTHESE DECISIONS ARE BEST MADE AT THE STATE LEVEL BY THE PEOPLE\nAND WHERE DISPUTES ARISE THEY SHOULD BE RESOLVED IN THE\nCOURTS. >> LAST QUESTION.\n>> GOVERNOR PENCE -- >> THIS GUY RIGHT HERE.\nHE WAS PATIENT AND HE WASN'T SCREAMING SHOUTING OUT SO --\n>> THANK YOU.

I CAN TELL WHERE YOU'RE GOING.\n>> SPEAKER RYAN HAS REPEATEDLY AND AT TIMES FORCEFULLY REBUKED\nDONALD TRUMP FOR SOME OF HIS REMARKS.\nI'M WONDERING IF THAT MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR YOU AS YOU REACH\nOUT TO REPUBLICANS ON THE FENCE AND IF THAT'S BEEN HURTFUL TO\nTHE CAMPAIGN. >> MY AND DONALD TRUMP'S RESPECT\nAND APPRECIATION FOR SPEAKER PAUL RYAN IS BOUNDLESS.\nLOOK, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE -- IN A MAJORITY PARTY, YOU'RE GOING\nTO HAVE DIFFERENCE OF OPINIONS BUT YOUR GOALS ARE IDENTICAL.\nMEETING I HAD WITH THIS SPEAKER IS HOW MUCH CONSISTENCY THERE IS\nBETWEEN DONALD TRUMP'S VISION TO REBUILD OUR MILITARY, REVIVE THE\nAMERICAN ECONOMY, UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW.\nAND THE AGENT TA THAT HOUSE REPUBLICANS HAVE PUT FORWARD IN\nTHE BETTER WAY. I REALLY DO BELIEVE WE HAVE AN\nHISTORIC OPPORTUNITY BEFORE US TODAY WITH THE ENORMOUS TALENT\nHERE IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES LED BY SPEAKER\nPAUL RYAN WITH THE ENERGY AND THE VISION OF A PRESIDENT DONALD\nTRUMP AND RE-ELECTED REPUBLICAN SENATE TO TURN THIS COUNTRY\nAROUND. AND TO TURN IT AROUND VERY\nQUICKLY. I MEAN, I SAID TO THE CONFERENCE\nTODAY, THIS IS THE MOST DRAMATIC CHOICE IN AN ELECTION IN MY\nLIFETIME. THIS IS NOT A CHOICE BETWEEN ONE\nCANDIDATE WHO WILL GROW AMERICA THIS MUCH AND ANOTHER CANDIDATE\nWHO WILL GROW AMERICA THIS MUCH. THIS LITERALLY SAY CHOICE\nBETWEEN WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO GO DOWNHILL TO A\nWEAKER AMERICA AT HOME AND ABROAD.\nWHETHER WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WALK AWAY FROM THE\nCONSTITUTIONAL LIBERTIES ENSHRINED IN THE INTERPRETATION\nOF THOSE BY OUR SUPREME COURT. WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO WALK AWAY\nFROM THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF INTEGRITY OF THE HIGHEST OFFICE\nOF THE LAND. WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO PLANT OUR\nFEET AND START TO MARCH BACKUP HILL TOWARDS GREATER STRENGTH\nAND GREATER PROSPERITY. HOUSE REPUBLICANS, SENATE\nREPUBLICANS ARE DEEPLY COMMITTED TO MARCHING UP THAT HILL.\nWHEN WE ELECT DONALD TRUMP AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES OF AMERICA, THEY WILL HAVE A TEAM AND A PARTNER IN THE\nWHITE HOUSE TO MARCH BACK UP TO A STRONGER AND GREATER AMERICA.\nALL RIGHT. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT WAS\nSAID AT THIS GOP LEADERSHIP PRESSER.\nWE'LL HEAR FROM MANU RAJU WHO WAS IN THAT ROOM IN A MOMENT.\nWHY WAS MIKE PENCE THERE? >> FIRST AND FOREMOST, REALLY\nWANTS TO MAKE THIS CONSERVATIVES FEEL THIS RACE IS NOT SLIPPING\nAWAY FROM THEM. MAKE HOUSE REPUBLICANS FEEL\nDESPITE WHAT THEY MAY SEE IN THE PRESS OR HEAR FROM THE\nCONSTITUENTS THAT THE TOP OF THE TICKET IS FINE AND WITH THEM.\nDONALD TRUMP IS SIMPLY NOT ONE OF THEM.\nTHESE HOUSE REPUBLICANS WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR OWN MAJORITY\nWANT SOME COMFORT. MIKE PENCE SERVED IN THAT BODY\nFOR 12 YEARS. HE'S SOMETHING LIKE XANAX I\nTHINK FOR THESE CONSERVATIVES WHO ARE JITTERY, WORRIED ABOUT\nWHAT DONALD TRUMP MAY DO TO THE TOP OF THE TICKET.\nHE'S THERE TO REASSURE PEOPLE, SORT OF GIVE THEM SOME MARCHING\nORDERS HERE ON WHAT THEY SHOULD BE GOING AFTER AND THAT IS\nHILLARY CLINTON'S DEPLORABLE LINE.\n>> MIKE PENCE HELD A PRIVATE MEETING WITH THE GOP LEADERSHIP\nAND HE TOLD MANY, MANY PERSONAL STORIES ABOUT DONALD TRUMP.\nSAID HE JUST WISHED THE HOUSE LEADERSHIP COULD KNOW DONALD\nTRUMP AS MIKE PENCE DOES BECAUSE HE'S SUCH A WARM HUMAN BEING.\nWHY TELL PERSONAL STORIES LIKE THAT?\n>> I THINK AS JEFF WAS SAYING, HE DEFINITELY HAS SOME CLOUD\nWITH HOUSE REPUBLICANS THERE. I THINK IT MAKES THEM AS A\nTICKET CERTAINLY MORE RELATABLE. HE HAD RELATIONSHIPS POINT BLANK\nON CAPITOL HILL THAT TRUMP DOES NOT HAVE.\nHIM BECOMING SOMETHING OF A CHARACTER WITNESS FOR DONALD\nTRUMP IS AN IMPORTANT ROLE THAT HE WILL PLAY NOT ONLY THE\nCAMPAIGN TRAIL. WE'VE STARTED TO SEE HIM DO THAT\nALL AROUND THIS COUNTRY. BUT ESPECIALLY ON CAPITOL HILL\nWHERE THERE ARE SOME REPUBLICANS WHO ARE STILL UNSURE OF DONALD\nTRUMP AND UNSURE OF THEM AS A TICKET.\nSO MIKE PENCE CERTAINLY PLAYING HIS ROLE HERE AS HIS RUNNING\nMATE. >> I KNOW -- I'M SURE THE WORD\n\"UNITY\" CAME UP MANY TIMES IN THAT CLOSED DOOR MEETING TOO.\nOF COURSE REPORTERS ASKED MIKE PENCE ABOUT DAVID DUKE.\nWHEN PENCE WAS ON WOLF'S SHOW YESTERDAY, HE DID NOT\nDENOUNCE -- WE, HE DENOUNCED DAVID DUKE BUT HE DIDN'T SAY HE\nWAS DEPLORABLE. LET'S LISTEN TO WHAT MIKE PENCE\nSAID TODAY. >> DAVID DUKE REPEATEDLY WE HAVE\nSAID THAT WE DO NOT WANT HIS SUPPORT AND WE DO NOT WANT THE\nSUPPORT OF PEOPLE WHO -- >> WE HAD A TECHNICAL PROBLEM\nTHERE, BUT MIKE PENCE AGAIN SAID HE'S INTO CIVILITY, LARRY, HE\nDOESN'T LIKE TO CALL PEOPLE NAMES.\nHE SAID DONALD TRUMP AND HIMSELF DENOUNCED DAVID DUKE MANY TIMES.\nWAS IT A FAIR QUESTION? >> OH, ABSOLUTELY.\nBECAUSE, AGAIN, JUST TO REFRESH PEOPLE'S MINDS, SOME MONTHS AGO,\nDONALD TRUMP DID NOT IMMEDIATELY DENOUNCE DAVID DUKE.\nHE TENDED TO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HIS EAR PIECE, HIS IFB, AND\nCLAIMED HE DIDN'T HEAR THE NAME DAVID DUKE.\nTHE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, AND WHETHER VICE PRESIDENTIAL\nNOMINEE MIKE PENCE ADMITS IT OR NOT, THERE ARE A LOT OF THESE\nWHITE NATIONALISTS WHO HAVE SEIZED UPON THE TRUMP CANDIDACY\nAND USED IT IN THEIR OWN WAYS TO PROMOTE THEIR AGENDA.\nTHEY'RE ALL OVER TWITTER. SO IT IS A PROBLEM.\nI THINK FRANKLY TRUMP AND PENCE WOULD DO WELL TO DENOUNCE THESE\nPEOPLE IN THE STRONGEST NATURAL TERMS.\nMAYBE THEY'RE NOT DEPLORABLE. I WOULD SAY DEPLORABLE IS TOO\nNICE A TERM FOR THEM. >> HE COULD HAVE COME UP WITH\nANOTHER ADJECTIVE. LET'S CHECK IN WITH MANU RAJU.\nHE WAS LISTENING AS THAT PRESS CONFERENCE WAS GOING ON.\nPENCE CLEARLY KNEW HE WAS GOING TO BE ASKED THAT QUESTION.\nHE WAS READY, MANU. >> YEAH, HE WAS.\nACTUALLY IN THIS MEETING THAT HAPPENED RIGHT BEFOREHAND, I WAS\nTOLD THIS REALLY DID NOT COME UP.\nTHIS IS AN HOUR-LONG MEETING HE HAD WITH HOUSE REPUBLICANS AFTER\nHE MET WITH SPEAKER PAUL RYAN. IN THAT MEETING, ACTUALLY,\nCAROL, IT WAS MORE OF A PEP RALLY MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE.\nTHEY TALK ABOUT UNITY, TALKING ABOUT HOW THE PARTY IS DOING\nBETTER. PENCE TRYING TO MAKE THE CASE\nACTUALLY TO HIS COLLEAGUES THAT THEY HAVE MOMENTUM BEHIND THE\nTOP OF THE TICKET. EVEN HOUSE REPUBLICANS, I'M\nTOLD, THE LEADER OF THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN EFFORT TO KEEP THE\nHOUSE MAJORITY SAID -- PRESENTED POLLING SHOWING THAT MIKE PENCE\nAND DONALD TRUMP AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET ACTUALLY ARE NOT\nHURTING DOWN TICKET CANDIDATES, ACTUALLY MAY BE HELPING IN SOME\nAREAS. WHEN MIKE PENCE CAME HERE AND\nADDRESSED THE PRESS, OF COURSE HE EXPECTED THAT QUESTION.\nHE REALLY DIDN'T DEVIATE FROM WHAT HE SAID YESTERDAY.\nTRYING TO MAKE CLEAR HE DENOUNCES DAVID DUKE.\nHE MAY NOT USE THE SAME TERMINOLOGY AS HILLARY CLINTON.\nSAYS HE'S NOT A NAME CALLER. BUT REALLY VIEWS IT AS A\nDISTINCTION WITHOUT A DIFFERENCE.\nTRYING TO DENOUNCE HIM. WHAT HE VIEWS AS THE STRONG ET\nPOSSIBLE TERMS. WHAT WILL BE INTERESTING TO HEAR\nIS WHETHER OR NOT PAUL RYAN WOULD ALSO AGREE WITH THAT.\nHE WOULD CALL DAVID DUKE DEPLORABLE.\nTHEY DID NOT TAKE MANY QUESTIONS.\nWE WEREN'T ABLE TO GET THAT QUESTION TO HIM.\nBUT CLEARLY THIS WAS AN EFFORT BY MIKE PENCE TO SHOW THAT THE\nPARTY IS UNITED BEHIND THE TICKET.\nHE WAS ASKED SPECIFICALLY ALSO WHETHER OR NOT PAUL RYAN'S\nCRITICISM OF DONALD TRUMP HAS HURT THE TOP OF THE TICKET.\nMIKE PENCE MAKING CLEAR THAT'S FINE.\nTHERE ARE DISAGREEMENTS ALL THE TIME WITHIN A PARTY.\nAND EXPRESSING HIS APPRECIATION FOR PAUL RYAN.\nA MUCH DIFFERENT MOOD HERE IN SEPTEMBER THAN IT WAS IN JULY\nWHEN DONALD TRUMP CAME TO MEET WITH HOUSE REPUBLICANS AND ONE\nREASON WHY, CAROL, POLL NUMBERS IMPROVING, HELPING THOSE\nBATTLEGROUND STATES. REPUBLICANS A LITTLE MORE\nCONFIDENT OF KEEPING THE MAJORITY IN CONGRESS AND ALSO\nDONALD TRUMP'S CHANCES IN NOVEMBER.\n>> OF COURSE DURING THIS PRESS CONFERENCE, THE REPUBLICAN\nLEADERSHIP ALSO BROUGHT UP THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY.\nTHEY SAID THE ECONOMY WAS GOING NOWHERE.\nBUT THE CENSUS DATA CAME OUT AND SHOWNED THE MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD\nINCOME ROSE TO $56,516 A YEAR. THAT'S UP 5.2% OVER THE LAST\nYEAR. SO MEDIAN INCOMES ARE RISING.\nTHE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS 4.9%. SO, JEFF, CAN THEY REALLY MAKE\nTHE CASE THAT THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO SINK?\nOH, BY THE WAY, PRESIDENT OBAMA'S APPROVAL RATING IN AN\nABC/\"WASHINGTON POST\" POLL IS NOW AT 58%.\n>> IT GETS HARDER FOR THEM TO MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT THINGS\nARE TERRIBLE HERE IN THE COUNTRY.",

INSTEAD IT WON'T BE ABOUT\nTRUMP'S HEALTH, IT WILL BE ABOUT TRUMP'S BUSINESS DEALINGS.\nBUT UNTIL IT COMES OUT, WHICH SHOULD EITHER BE OVERNIGHT SOME\nTIME TONIGHT OR TOMORROW, WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE.\nBUT IF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WHO WORKS IN THE NEWS BUSINESS AND\nTHEIR PHONES START GOING OFF LIKE THE FINALE IN A REALLY BIG\nFIREWORKS DISPLAY AROUND 4:00, 5:00 TODAY, THAT'S WHY.\nANTICIPATION ABOUT THAT \"NEWSWEEK\" STORY.\nTHAT COVER STORY WILL PROBABLY BE OUT, I'M GUESSING BY DAWN\nTOMORROW AT THE LATEST. MY EXPECTATION IT WILL PROBABLY\nBE EARLIER THAN THAT. BUT WE SHALL SEE.\nON THIS ISSUE OF THE CANDIDATE'S HEALTH, THOUGH, PRESIDENT OBAMA\nGAVE A LONG, VERY ENERGETIC SPEECH TODAY IN PHILLY ON BEHALF\nOF HILLARY CLINTON. IT WAS KIND OF A HOT AND SWEATY\nDAY IN PHILLY. THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH WENT ON\nFOR A WHILE VERY ENTHUSIASTIC CROWD.\nLOTS OF APPLAUSE BREAKS. IT WAS ALSO A LONG SPEECH.\nBUT SURE ENOUGH AT THIS EVENT IN PHILLY, SOMEBODY FAINTED.\nAND BY NOW FOR BETTER OR WORSE, FAINTING IS A PHENOMENON AT THE\nCENTER OF OUR POLITICAL DIALOGUE.\nWHEN IT HAPPENED AT THIS SPEECH TODAY IN PHILLY, PRESIDENT OBAMA\nVERY CLEARLY HAD AN ACTION PLAN AND SOME CONSTRUCTIVE\nSUGGESTIONS IS FOR THE REST OF THE CROWD.\n>> DEMOCRACY WORKS, BUT HERE'S THE THING.\nHERE -- WE HAVE SOMEBODY WHO FAINTED.\nTHIS IS WHAT HAPPENS. THEY'LL BE OKAY.\nJUST GIVE THEM A LITTLE ROOM. EVERYBODY BEND THEIR KNEES ONE\nTIME. JUST DON'T LOCK YOUR KNEES.\nKEEP ON BENDING THEM A LITTLE BIT.\nWE'LL DO A LITTLE EXERCISE RIGHT NOW.\nEMS FOLKS, THEY'RE RIGHT IN FRONT, IF YOU CAN FIND SOMEBODY.\nDRINK SOME WATER. I LOVE YOU, TOO.\nBUT BEND YOUR KNEES. >> I LOVE THE WHOLE CROWD KIND\nOF BOBBING ALONG WITH HIM. PRESIDENT OBAMA SPEAKING TODAY\nIN PHILADELPHIA LEADING THE CROWD IN SOME ANTI-FAINTING\nEXERCISES. THIS IS ACTUALLY OVERALL PRETTY\nREMARKABLE CAMPAIGN APPEARANCE FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA TONIGHT,\nSOMETHING WE HAVEN'T QUITE SEEN YET FROM HIM.\nWE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE ON THAT COMING UP TONIGHT.\nON THIS HEALTH ISSUE, THOUGH, WE'VE ALSO GOT SOME STRANGE,\nEVEN KIND OF BAFFLING NEW REPORTING, NEW INFORMATION ABOUT\nTHE HEALTH RECORDS OR AT LEAST THE HEALTH INFORMATION WE'RE\nABOUT TO GET FROM OUR TWO PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES.\nBOTH OF THEM ARE IN A STRANGE, IF NOT UNPRECEDENTED, POSITION\nON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. THIS IS USUALLY THE LEAST\nCONTROVERSIAL THING IN MY CAMPAIGN.\nBUT THIS YEAR IT'S DIFFERENT. ON HILLARY CLINTON'S SIDE, IT'S\nDIFFERENT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE SHE HAD THAT HEALTH EPISODE IN\nPUBLIC ON SUNDAY AT THE 9/11 MEMORIAL.\nTODAY WILL BE HER SECOND DAY OFF THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL RESTING AND\nRECOVERING FROM WHAT HER CAMPAIGN SAYS WAS A PNEUMONIA\nDIAGNOSIS. AS I MENTIONED AT THE TOP OF THE\nSHOW, SHE'S NOW ANNOUNCED DISHTS'S NOW ANNOUNCED BY THE\nCAMPAIGN THAT SHE'LL BE BACK ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL BY THURSDAY\nNIGHT IN NORTH CAROLINA. SO IN TERMS OF HER MEDICAL\nRECORDS AND US EXPECTING ADDITIONAL MEDICAL INFORMATION\nFROM HER AT THIS POINT IN THE CAMPAIGN, I MEAN, THIS HAD BE A\nSECOND RELEASE OF MEDICAL RECORDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE\nCAMPAIGN AFTER SHE SAID SHE WOULDN'T RELEASE ANY FURTHER\nMEDICAL RECORDS BEYOND THE DOCTOR'S LETTER SHE PUT OUT LAST\nSUMMER, BUT SHE'S IN AN UNUSUAL POSITION TO REVISE HER EARLIER\nSTATEMENT. ESSENTIALLY IN A WAY THAT'S\nGOVERNED BY NECESSITY BECAUSE SHE HAD THAT INCIDENT IN PUBLIC\nON SUNDAY AFTERNOON. THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE\nCLINTON SIDE. ON THE TRUMP SIDE, HE IS ALSO IN\nA VERY UNUSUAL POSITION WHEN IT COMES TO HIS HEALTH BECAUSE HIS\nFORTHCOMING DISCLOSURE OF ADDITIONAL MEDICAL INFORMATION,\nTHAT'S NECESSITATED ON HIS SIDE MOSTLY BY THE FACT THAT THE\nINITIAL DOCUMENT HE PUT OUT TO ATTEST TO HIS HEALTH WAS SUCH A\nWEIRD DOCUMENT. >> I'VE BEEN THE PERSONAL\nPHYSICIAN OF MR. DONALD J. TRUMP SINCE 1980.\nHIS PREVIOUS POSITION WAS MY FATHER DR. JACOB BORNSTEIN.\nI'M PLEASED TO REPORT THAT MR. TRUMP HAS HAD NO SIGNIFICANT\nMEDICAL PROBLEM. HE'S HAD A RECENT COMPLETE EXAM\nTHAT SHOWED ONLY POSITIVE RESULTS.\nSENTENCE IS PROBABLY NOT RIGHT. BUT WRITTEN CORRECTLY.\nBUT I GOT A \"D\" IN GERMAN. HIS PULP IS 110/65 AND HIS\nLABORATORY TESTS ARE ASTONISHINGLY EXCELLENT.\nHIS PHYSICAL STRENGTH AND STAMINA ARE EXTRAORDINARY.\nIF ELECTED, I CAN SAY HE'LL BE THE HEALTHIEST INDIVIDUAL EVER\nELECTED TO THE PRESIDENCY. >> DR. BORNSTEIN, PHRASES LIKE\nASTONISHINGLY EXCELLENT SEEM A LITTLE BIT OVER THE TOP TO SOME\nPEOPLE. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?\nIS THAT THE WAY THAT YOU WRITE MOST OF YOUR MEDICAL LETTERS?\n>> NO, BUT FOR MR. TRUMP I WROTE THAT LETTER.\n>> THAT'S DONALD TRUMP'S GASTROENTEROLOGIST READING OUT\nLOUD PORTIONS OF THIS UNUSUAL LETTER THAT HE SIGNED HIS NAME\nTO WHICH REMAINS THE ONLY PUBLIC DOCUMENTATION THAT DONALD TRUMP\nHAS RELEASED TO DESCRIBE HIS OWN HEALTH STATUS.\nIT HAS BEEN WIDELY NOTED THAT PHRASES LIKE ASTONISHINGLY XENLT\nAND EXTRAORDINARY STRENGTH AND HIM BEING THE HEALTHIEST\nINDIVIDUAL EVER ELECTED TO THE PRESIDENCY, WIDELY NOTED, WIDELY\nLITIGATED. PHRASES LIKE THAT ARE WEIRD FOR\nA MEDICAL DOCUMENT LET ALONE A DOCUMENT SAYING THAT ALL OF HIS\nTEST RESULTS WERE POSITIVE. THAT'S NOT USUALLY A GOOD THING\nWHEN ALL YOUR TEST RESULTS ARE POSITIVE.\nBUT LOST IN THE DISCUSSION OF THAT DOCUMENT, I THINK, IT'S\nALSO WORTH NOTING, PARTICULARLY AT THIS TIME WHEN THERE'S SO\nMUCH RENEWED FOCUS ON THIS ISSUE, IT'S WORTH NOTING WHEN\nNBC NEWS WAS ABLE TO DO A FOLLOW-UP INTERVIEW, HE DIDN'T\nJUST EXPLAIN HIMSELF ABOUT THAT HYPERBOLIC AND SOMEWHAT\nUNPROFESSIONAL LANGUAGE, HE ALSO REALLY QUALIFIED AND DIALED BACK\nAND GOT MUCH LESS AMBITIOUS IN TERMS OF WHAT HE WAS WILLING TO\nSAY ABOUT HOW HEALTHY DONALD TRUMP IS.\n>> DO YOU HAVE ANY MEDICAL CONCERNS ABOUT HIM?\n>> MEDICAL CONCERNS? I GUESS YOU HAVE THE SAME\nAVERAGE MEDICAL CONCERNS YOU HAVE FOR A 70-YEAR-OLD MAN.\n>> THE ONLY OTHER QUESTION THAT I THINK PEOPLE ARE CURIOUS ABOUT\nIS HE WOULD BE THE MOST -- THE HEALTHIEST PERSON EVER TO TAKE\nOFFICE. >> WELL, I THINK MOST OF THE\nPRESIDENCY SINCE WOODROW WILSON WAS WALKING AROUND WITH AZ\nHEMORRHAGE IN HIS BRAIN AND EISENHOWER, ONE ANSWERED THE\nOTHER, WE HAVE NOT HAD VERY -- THESE PEOPLE ARE OLDER AND THEY\nDEVELOP ADULT ILLNESSES. I DON'T THINK HE'S THE\nHEALTHIEST PERSON EVER ELECTED. YOU COULD ELECT A 22-YEAR-OLD.\n>> HOW DO YOU KNOW HE WOULD BE IN THE BEST HEALTH OF ANY\nPRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES?\n>> I LIKED THAT SENTENCE. I LIKE THAT SENTENCE, TO BE\nQUITE HONEST WITH YOU. AND ALL THE REST OF THEM, WE'VE\nHAD EVERYTHING AS PRESIDENT. PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA AND PEOPLE\nWITH TUMORS. WE'VE HAD EVERYTHING AS\nPRESIDENT. WE'VE HAD PSYCHOTIC AND\nPARANOIDS AND WE'VE HAD ALL IN MY OWN LIFETIME.\nWE'VE HAD PLENTY OF VERY DISTURBED PEOPLE IN THERE AND\nTHEY'VE USUALLY BEEN FORTUNATE TO BE HELD IN CHECK.\n>> AND DO YOU THINK HE WOULD BE FIT TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE\nUNITED STATES? >> YES, I THINK HE WOULD BE FIT\nAS ALL THE REST. WHO IS FIT OUT ON THE STREET IN\nTHERE'S AN INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE OF DISEASE.\nTHE INCIDENCE OF DISEASE IS WHAT'S OUT THERE, THE PREVALENCE\nIS WHAT WALKS INTO THE OFFICE. WHO KNOWS?\n>> WHO KNOWS? HE'S AS FIT AS ANY OF US.\nI MEAN -- WHEN INTERVIEWED BY NBC NEWS, WHEN ASKED TO\nELABORATE ON HIS SORT OF OVER THE TOP, UNUSUAL LETTER\nATTESTING TO DONALD TRUMP'S SUPERHUMAN HEALTH, WHICH AGAIN\nAS OF THIS POINT IS ALL WE'VE GOT ABOUT TRUMP'S HEALTH, THE\nDOCTOR WHO WROTE THAT EVALUATION WAS NOT NEARLY AS MUCH OF A\nBOOSTER OF DONALD TRUMP'S HEALTH AS THE LETTER HAD MADE HIM SEEM.\nJUST ONE LAST PIECE OF THIS. IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT THE\nDOCTOR SAID HE WAS RUSHED INTO WRITING THAT LETTER, THAT IT WAS\nNOT PROOFREAD, THAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN ONLY GAVE HIM FIVE\nMINUTES TO WRITE IT. THEY HAD A CAR WAITING OUTSIDE\nWHILE HE COMPLETED IT. THE DOCTOR'S WIFE WHO WORKS IN\nTHE OFFICE RAISED THE PROSPECT THAT THAT WHOLE ASTONISHINGLY\nEXCELLENT LINE ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S HEALTH, THAT MIGHT HAVE\nACTUALLY BEEN MEANT AS A JOKE. >> THE LETTER DOES SOUND\nPECULIAR. I KNOW THERE WAS A PHYSICIAN ON\nTELEVISION ON ANOTHER NETWORK WHO WAS SAYING NO ONE WOULD SAY\nPOSITIVE RESULTS -- >> YOU KNOW WHAT?\n>> HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU HAVE TO SIT HERE IN FIVE MINUTES?\nAND I GOT FIVE MINUTES TO WRITE THAT LETTER.\n>> OKAY. AND --\n>> UNPROOFREAD. IT WAS NEVER PROOF READ.\nI HAD FIVE MINUTES TO SIT AT THAT DESK AND WRITE THAT LETTER\nWHILE THE DRIVER WAITED FOR IT. >> SO YOU GOT A REQUEST FROM MR.\nTRUMP TO PLEASE HAVE A LETTER -- >> EVERYBODY NEEDS A LETTER.\nEVERYBODY NEEDS A LETTER. HILLARY NEEDED A LETTER.\nAND DONALD NEEDED A LETTER. >> SO HE CAME TO YOU -- HE SAID\nDR. BORNSTEIN. >> I'M HIS DOCTOR AND HE NEEDED\nA LETTER. AND MY HUSBAND DOES HAVE A SENSE\nOF HUMOR. AND SO THE ASTONISHING WORD\nCOULD SOUND HOWEVER YOU INTERPRET IT, DR. BORNSTEIN WO\nTHAT. THIS IS DR. BORNSTEIN WITH HIS\nLONG HAIR AND HIS EARRINGS. YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT WHO HE IS.\n>> MY HUSBAND DOES HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR, SO THAT ASTONISHING\nWORD, THAT IS THE ORIGIN OF ALL OF THE MEDICAL INFORMATION THAT\nWE'VE GOT RIGHT NOW ON THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR\nPRESIDENT WHO WOULD BE THE OLDEST PERSON EVER SWORN IN FOR\nA FIRST TERM AS PRESIDENT IF HE IS ELECTED.\nAND SO YEAH, THAT'S WHY THAT NEEDS TO BE CLEANED UP ON THE\nREPUBLICAN SIDE. WELL, WE HAVE NOW GOT THE PRESS\nRELEASE FOR THE DR. OZ SHOW ANNOUNCING THAT THE DAY AFTER\nTOMORROW DONALD TRUMP WILL REVEAL HIS OWN PERSONAL HEALTH\nREGIMEN ON THAT DAYTIME TV SHOW, QUOTE, DR. OZ ONE ON ONE WITH\nDONALD TRUMP, A NO HOLDS BARRED CONVERSATION YOU'LL BE TALKING\nABOUT. THEY PUT OUT THE PRESS RELEASE A\nCOUPLE OF DAYS AGO. TODAY WE GOT ELABORATION ON JUST\nHOW NO HOLDS BARRED THAT CONVERSATION WILL BE.\nTURNS THE OUT QUITE A FEW HOLDS WILL BE BARRED IN THAT\nCONVERSATION. >> THEN BE ARE GOING TO HAVE THE\nRELEASE OF THE DONALD TRUMP RECORDS.\nHE'S ALREADY TAKEN THE EXAM LAST WEEK.\nAND YOU ARE GOING TO GO OVER THE RESULTS WITH HIM LIVE ON\nTELEVISION? OR TAPED ON TELEVISION?\n>> WE HAVEN'T TAPED THE SHOW YET.\nWE'RE GOING TO TAPE IT ON WEDNESDAY TO AIR ON THURSDAY.\nIT'S REALLY HIS DECISION, HIS PERSONAL RECORDS.\nI WILL ASK HIM POINTED QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS HEALTH.\n>> WHAT IF THERE'S EMBARRASSING THINGS?\n>> I BET HE WON'T RELEASE THEM. >> IT WILL STILL BE HIS\nDECISION? >> HIS DECISION.\nTHE METAPHOR FOR ME IS THIS IS A DOCTOR'S OFFICE, THE STUDIO.\nI'M NOT GOING TO ASK HIM QUESTIONS THAT HE DOESN'T WANT\nTO HAVE ANSWERED. >> A NO HOLDS BARRED\nCONVERSATION EXCEPT I'M NOT GOING TO ASK HIM QUESTIONS HE\nDOESN'T WANT ANSWERED. WHAT IF THERE'S EMBARRASSING\nTHINGS ON THERE? I BET HE WON'T RELEASE HIM.\nIT IS GOING TO BE HIS DECISION? IT'S HIS DECISION.\nDONALD TRUMP WON'T BE ASKED ANY QUESTIONS HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE\nANSWERED AND ANYTHING EMBARRASSING OR TROUBLING IN HIS\nMEDICAL RECORDS JUST WON'T BE INCLUDED IN IT.\nTHIS IS WHAT THEY'RE DOING THE AS THEIR FULL REVEAL OF DONALD\nTRUMP'S MEDICAL HISTORY. AND IT'S NOT LIKE DONALD TRUMP\nIS BEING EXAMINED BY THIS DOCTOR WHO HAS THE TV TALK SHOW.\nIT'S SOMEBODY ELSE WHO DID THE MEDICAL EXAM APPARENTLY LAST\nWEEK. HE APPEARED TO HAVE DITCHED HIS\nTRAVELING PRESS POOL AND GOTTEN A PHYSICAL EXAM SOMEWHERE, BUT\nREPORTERS DIDN'T WITNESS HIM GOING TO ANY DOCTOR.\nWE DON'T KNOW WHERE THE MEDICAL EXAM WAS OR WHO DID IT.\nIT IS NOT CLEAR IF WE'RE EVER GOING TO FIND THAT OUT.\nTHERE WERE THREE DIFFERENT DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THAT TODAY.\nONE WAS WITH DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER WHEN\nINTERVIEWED BY ANDREA MITCHELL WHO ASKED KELLYANNE CONWAY IF\nTHIS REPORT IS GOING TO BE REVEALED ON TV AND IF IT WAS\nDONE BY THE GUY WHO WROTE THE INITIAL SORT OF CRAZY LETTER\nABOUT TRUMP'S HEALTH WHO SAID PART OF IT WAS JOKING AND HE\nWROTE IT IN FIVE MINUTES. ANDREA ASKED IS IT THAT SAME\nDOCTOR WHO DID THE EXAM? DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER\nSAYS SHE DOESN'T KNOW. >> SO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO LEARN\nABOUT THE MEDICAL CONDITION, HIS HEALTH REPORT TOMORROW FROM\nDONALD TRUMP? >> WELL, MR. TRUMP HAD A\nPHYSICAL LATE LAST WEEK, ANDREA. HE BELIEVES THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR\nTHE PUBLIC TO KNOW WHAT HIS BASIC HEALTH CONDITION IS.\nAND HE HAS SAID THAT THE DOCTOR IS PREPARING HIS REPORT AND THAT\nIT WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE THIS WEEK.\n>> AND WAS IT WITH DR. BORNSTEIN?\n>> THAT I DON'T KNOW. I WAS NOT PRESENT FOR HIS\nPHYSICAL. >> ON THE ONE HAND I'M GLAD THAT\nCANDIDATES DON'T HAVE TO BRING THEIR CAMPAIGN MANAGER INTO THE\nPHYSICAL. THERE'S ENOUGH REASON NOT TO RUN\nFOR OFFICE. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, WHO DID\nTHE PHYSICAL? IT MATTERS GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW\nABOUT THE FIRST ATTESTATION THAT WE GOT TO DONALD TRUMP'S HEALTH\nAND HOW HIS DOCTOR APPROACHED THAT LETTER.\nIT MATTERS. A DISCUSSION ON THAT POINT WAS\nON FOX NEWS IN ADVANCE OF THEIR INTERVIEW WITH THE TV DOCTOR IN\nWHICH ONE OF THE HOSTS SUGGESTED IT WASN'T DR. BORNSTEIN WHO DID\nTHE EXAM, IT WAS A DIFFERENT DOCTOR, BUT WE DON'T KNOW.\n>> IS DONALD TRUMP'S DOCTOR THAT'S EXAMINING HIM NOW AND HIS\nSPECIMEN NOW IS THAT THE SAME DOCTOR THAT SAID HE WAS TOTALLY\nFIT, THE MOST HEALTHIEST TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT?\n>> THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. I THINK IT'S A DIFFERENT DOCTOR.\n>> YOU THINK IT'S A DIFFERENT DOCTOR.\nWELL, IS IT A DIFFERENT DOCTOR? LET'S ASK THE TV GUY.\n>> WHEN I SEE WHAT YOU DO ON THURSDAY, WILL I FEEL LIKE I\nKNOW WHAT DONALD TRUMP'S HEALTH IS BY THE END OF YOUR SHOW?\n>> YOU SHOULD. THAT'S THE GOAL.\n>> IF HE TELLS YOU DON'T SAY THIS, DON'T SAY THAT, DON'T SAY\nTHIS, YOU WON'T. WILL YOU SAY THAT YOU DID NOT\nWANT ME TO SAY MY BLOOD PRESSURE, YOU DON'T WANT ME TO\nTALK ABOUT MY -- >> IF HE PUTS LIMITATIONS ON,\nI'LL ACKNOWLEDGE THEM. >> BUT YOU'RE NOT DOING THE\nEXAM? >> I'M NOT DOING THE EXAM.\nI DON'T WANT TO BE HIS DOCTOR. >> WILL YOU TALK TO HIS DOCTOR?\n>> I WILL TALK TO HIS DOCTOR IF THEY ALLOW ME TO.\nAT THIS POINT THEY SAY ASK WHATEVER QUESTIONS YOU WANT.\n>> OF DONALD. >> OF DONALD.\n>> WILL YOU ASK TO GET ACCESS TO HIS DOCTOR?\n>> I HAVE NOT ASKED TO ACCESS THAT DOCTOR.\n>> I HAVEN'T ASKED. TO BE CLEAR AT A POINT WHEN THE\nHEALTH OF TWO CANDIDATES AND THEM RELEASING THEIR MEDICAL\nRECORDS IS OVERT AS IT HAS BEEN THIS LATE IN A PRESIDENTIAL\nELECTION, WE ARE WAITING ON THE HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN TO\nRELEASE HER MEDICAL RECORDS. WE DON'T KNOW HOW COMPREHENSIVE\nIT WILL BE, IN WHAT FORM THOSE WILL BE DELIVERED.\nTRUST ME, I PERSONALLY HAVE PRESSED TO TRY TO GET THAT\nINFORMATION IN TERMS OF WHAT WE SHOULD EXPECT.\nALL THEY'LL TELL US IS WHATEVER WE'RE GOING TO GET, IT WILL COME\nBY THE END OF THE WEEK. THAT'S ALL WE KNOW.\nON THE DONALD TRUMP SIDE OF IT, WHAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS\nDECIDED TO DO IS MAKE A SPECTACLE OF IT.\nTHEIR CANDIDATE GO ON A TV TALK SHOW TO HAVE A TV DOCTOR REVEAL\nTO THE STUDIO AUDIENCE WHAT'S IN NOTES FROM A PHYSICAL EXAM TAKEN\nBY AN UNDISCLOSED DOCTOR WHO MAY OR MAY NOT BE THE DOCTOR WHOSE\nPREVIOUSLY LETTER WAS INTENDED AT LEAST PARTIALLY AS A JOKE.\nDONALD TRUMP WILL NOT INCLUDE ANYTHING EMBARRASSING OR THAT HE\nDOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IN THOSE RECORDS THAT WILL BE\nREVEALED ON TV AND HE'LL NOT BE ASKED TO TALK ABOUT ANYTHING HE\nDOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT AND NOTHING WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE\nDISCUSSION THAT MAKES DONALD TRUMP THE LEAST BIT UNHAPPY.\nWE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO KNOW NOR WILL ANYBODY DIRECT ANY\nQUESTIONS TO THE ACTUAL DOCTOR WHO DID THIS SUPPOSED MEDICAL\nEXAM THAT HAPPENED IN SECRET AFTER TRUMP DITCHED REPORTERS TO\nDO IT. SO GOOD.\nWE'RE GOING TO GET ALL THAT CLEARED UP THEN, WE'LL BE ABLE\nTO MOVE RIGHT ON. ASTONISHING INDEED.\nTHERE'S A LOT GOING ON TONIGHT.

JUST PUTTING THAT OUT THERE.\n>> PRECISELY. >> THE WHOLE IDEA OF CHARITABLE\nCONTRIBUTIONS ON THE PART OF DONALD TRUMP.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA WENT AFTER HIM TODAY IN HIS SPEECH IN\nPHILADELPHIA. DEMOCRATS ON THE HOUSE JUDICIARY\nCOMMITTEE WANT TO HOLD HEARINGS ON TRUMP'S DONATIONS TO FLORIDA\nATTORNEY GENERAL PAM BONDI. THEY WANT TO PRESS TRUMP INTO\nRELEASING INFORMATION ABOUT HIS CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS.\nWILL THEY SUCCEED? >> THEY'RE TRYING TO GET THEM TO\nSTICK WITH VOTERS. THE IDEA THAT HOUSE DEMOCRATS\nWILL BE ABLE TO HAVE HEARINGS OVER THIS, TA IT WON'T HAPPEN.\nTHEY DON'T HAVE THE POWER. THEY'RE IN THE MINORITY.\nWE HAVE TALKED ABOUT HOW TRUSTWORTHINESS IS HILLARY\nCLINTON'S BIGGEST ACHILLES' HEEL.\nAS WE CLOSE INTO THE CAMPAIGN'S FINAL DAYS, DONALD TRUMP, I\nTHINK THIS WILL TURN OUT TO BE AN ACHILLES' HEEL FOR HIM AS\nWELL. THE IDEA HE SAYS HE CANNOT\nRELEASE THE TAX BECAUSE HE IS UNDER AUDIT WE KNOW IS FALSE.\nHE COULD CERTAINLY RELEASE SOME INFORMATION.\nWE'LL SEE WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION HE RELEASES FROM HIS\nMEDICAL RECORD AS WELL, WOLF. WILL IT BE AS DETAILED AS WE\nWANT IT? PROBABLY NOT.\nI THINK WE CAN, YOU KNOW, FORECAST THAT AHEAD.\nHE IS ALSO GOING ON THE DR. OZ SHOW, A REALITY TELEVISION SHOW\nIN MANY WAYS, TO DO SO. WHILE WE DO CRITICIZE HILLARY\nCLINTON OR AT LEAST TALK ABOUT HER WEAKNESS IN HONEST AND\nTRUSTWORTHINESS, I DO THINK THAT DONALD TRUMP IS DEALING WITH THE\nSAME ISSUE AS WELL. >> YOU KNOW -- YOU'VE BEEN\nLOOKING INTO THE WHOLE NOTION. HE HAD HIS PHYSICAL, DONALD\nTRUMP, LAST WEEK. SAID HE'LL RELEASE THE RESULTS\nLATER THIS WEEK, NOW WE ARE LEARNING HE'LL DO IT AS MARK\nJUST SAID ON THE DR. OZ PROGRAM. >> THAT'S RIGHT.\nAND YOU KNOW, I GUESS THE QUESTION IS HOW ARE VOTERS GOING\nTO RECEIVE THIS. WELL, A LOT OF PEOPLE WATCH THE\nSHOW, SO THEY MIGHT RECEIVE IT VERY WELL.\nBUT JUST JUDGING BY WHAT DR. OZ SAID IN AN INTERVIEW ABOUT\nTALKING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP ABOUT THIS, PERHAPS THEY SHOULD NOT.\nBECAUSE HE ACTUALLY SAID, YOU KNOW, I CALLED THE STUDIO THE\nDOCTOR'S OFFICE AND HE SAID I'M NOT GOING TO ASK HIM QUESTIONS\nHE DOESN'T WANT TO HAVE ANSWERED.\nTHIS ISN'T THE SAME AS BEING INTERVIEWED BY A DOCTOR WHO ALSO\nWEARS THE HAT OF JOURNALIST. HE ALSO WEARS THE HAT OF\nENTERTAINER AND HAS MADE IT CLEAR HE WON'T ASK QUESTIONS\nTHAT DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T WANT TO ANSWER.\n>> THIS REMINDS ME OF THE TAX RETURN PLAYBOOK.\nINITIALLY HE SAID I'M GOING TO RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS.\nTHEY'RE BIG AND BEAUTIFUL AND GREAT.\nTHEN HE SAID I AM UNDER AUDIT. I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO DO\nIT. NOW HE SAYS ONCE I AM DONE BEING\nAUDITED I'LL RELEASE THEM. THIS IS KIND OF THE SAME AS THE\nMEDICAL RECORDS. HE SAYS HE'LL RELEASE THEM AND\nNOW HE SAYS HE'LL RELEASE PART OF THEM.\nNOW HIS CAMPAIGN MANAGER, KELLYANNE CONWAY, TALKS ABOUT\nPRIVACY. UNLESS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YOUR\nFAMILY AND KIDS, PRIVACY IS CANCELED.\n>> YOU WANT TO BE PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS.\nTHAT'S THE HISTORY. >>> STAND BY.\nWORD OF AN ALARMING NEW",

THEY'RE BOTH AGING, IT'S NOT\nINAPPROPRIATE TO ASK IF THEY CAN HANDLE THE GRUELLINGNESS OF THIS\nJOB AND I DON'T THINK EITHER OF THEM HAVE BEEN WILLING.\n>> I AGREE BOTH CANDIDATE SHOULD RELEASE EVERY DETAIL OF THEIR\nMEDICAL RECORDS TO US, WE DESERVE TO KNOW.\nTWO, HILLARY CLINTON HAS RELEASED MORE THAN DONALD TRUMP\nAND WILL RELEASE MORE. THREE, WHY DR. OZ?\nBECAUSE IT'S A SCAM. WE'RE NOT GOING TO LEARN\nANYTHING. THE NEXT TIME I GO TO MY DOCTOR\nFOR A CHECKUP I'M GOING TO GIVE HIM A LIST OF QUESTION THAT HE'S\nALLOWED TO ASK BUT DON'T YOU ASK ANYTHING THAT'S NOT ON THE LIST.\n>> WE HAVE NO REASON TO QUESTION DONALD TRUMP'S HEALTH.\nNO REASON.

TAX RETURNS I THINK MATTER\nBECAUSE IT SAYS WILL DONALD TRUMP SCAM MIDDLE-CLASS VOTERS\nTHE WAY WE THINK HE'S SCAMMED THE IRS OR NOT?\nI THINK WHAT THIS ELECTION IS GOING TO END UP BEING ABOUT AND\nWHAT I HOPE WE'RE GOING TO SEE IN THE DEBATES IS HOW DOES THIS\nACTUALLY AFFECT EVERYDAY AMERICANS WHO I THINK WE HAVE\nTHE CANDIDATES WE'RE, YOU KNOW, THEY ARE AS HEALTHY AS THEY'RE\nGOING TO BE AND I DON'T HAVE ANY DOUBT THAT EITHER ONE OF THEM\nWILL BE HEALTHY ENOUGH TO BE PRESIDENT.\nWHAT I DO HAVE DOUBTS IS IS WHAT KIND OF PRESIDENTS THEY'LL BE\nAND WE WOULD ALL DO WELL TO SPEND MORE TIME TALKING ABOUT\nWHAT THEY'LL DO FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE INSTEAD OF HOW WE'LL\nCREATE AS MANY GOTCHA MOMENTS. >> HE HAS NOT SCAMMED THE IRS.\nHE'S PAID WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF THE LAW, VOTERS KNOW THAT.\n>> A. B., LET ME END WITH THIS. >> PROVE IT, KAYLEIGH, YOU CAN'T\nPROVE IT. >> MY QUESTION IS, S.E HIT ON\nTHIS, GOING BACK TO PRESIDENT OBAMA FULL CIRCLE WHEN SOMEBODY\nSHOUTED IN PHILADELPHIA \"$2 A GALLON FOR GAS.\"\nAND HE SAID \"THANKS, OBAMA.\" [ LAUGHTER ]\nTHEN HE TOUTED HEALTH CARE, TOUTED UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION\nGAYS CAN SERVE IN THE MILITARY. S.E CALLED IT GLIB.\nHOW DID YOU HEAR THAT? >> WELL, OBAMA'S APPROVAL\nNUMBERS HAVE CREPT INTO SPACE WE COULDN'T IMAGINE A YEAR AND A\nHALF AGO. IN 2014 OBAMA COULDN'T HELP\nDEMOCRATS CAMPAIGN FOR REELECTION IN THE MIDTERM\nELECTIONS AND HE'S NOW BY SOME POLLS WELL OVER 50% BUT EVEN AT\n58% BUT SORT OF AROUND 52% 5, 4% APPROVAL.\nSO AND SO I THINK HE'S IN HIS FINAL DAYS MAKING THIS LAP,\nVICTORY LAP AND TAKING CREDIT FOR THINGS AS HE TRIES TO WORK\nTO ELECT HILLARY CLINTON AND HE'S HOPING IT'S GOING TO HELP\nHER OBVIOUSLY WITH SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE SORT OF UNDECIDED,\nDEFINITELY WILL OPPOSE TRUMP BUT DON'T KNOW IF THEY'LL TURN OUT\nFOR HILLARY TO TELL THEM THINGS ARE BETTER THAN THEY SOUND.\nNO TRUMP SUPPORTER WILL EVER LISTEN TO A WORD HE SAYS.\nTHEY ALL THINK THE COUNTRY IS ON A TERRIBLE TRACK.\nBUT HE'S HOPING THERE ARE SOME INDEPENDENTS LEFT OR CENTRIST\nLEAN EITHER WAY VOTERS WHO ARE SKEPTICAL OF HILLARY BUT MAYBE\nTHEY WON'T COME AROUND ON ELECTION DAY AND HE CAN CONVINCE\nTHEM THINGS ARE GOOD ENOUGH AND SHE CAN CONTINUE WHAT HE'S DONE.\n>> ALL RIGHT. A. B. AND HILARY, KAYLEIGH, BILL\nAND S.E, THANK YOU. >>> COMING UP NEXT, HILLARY\nCLINTON IS NOT BACKING OFF HER COMMENTS THAT AT LEAST SOME OF\nDONALD TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS ARE RACIST, SEXIST AND XENOPHOBIC.\nMY NEXT GUEST SAYS HE HAS PROOF IN HIS INBOX.\nSTAY HERE. >>> CRITICS HAVE CALLED OUT\nHILLARY CLINTON FOR BEING POLITICALLY INCORRECT BUT SHE\nWASN'T WRONG, THEY SAY, WHEN SHE DESCRIBED HALF OF DONALD TRUMP'S\nSUPPORTERS AS BELONGING IN A BASKET OF DEPLORABLES.\nTRUMP'S CAMPAIGN DEMANDED A FULL APOLOGY FROM THE FORMER\nSECRETARY OF STATE AND MY NEXT GUEST SAYS THERE'S NO WAY TO\nQUANTIFY HOW MANY TRUMP SUPPORTERS FIT THIS DEPLORABLE\nDESCRIPTION BUT HE SAYS HE KNOWS THEY'RE OUT THERE BECAUSE HE HAS\nHEARD FROM THEM PERSONALLY.

I'VE BEEN REPORTING AND WRITING\nFOR 15 YEARS AND MY NAME APPEARS WITH ALL OF MY STORIES BUT I'VE\nNOTICED AN UPTICK COVERING THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, COVERING\nDONALD TRUMP AND THE E-MAILS THAT I'M GETTING, THE TWEETS I'M\nGETTING ARE TAKING ON A TONE -- THEY'RE PARROTING A LOT OF\nDONALD TRUMP'S GREATEST HITS, I'VE HAD PEOPLE TELL ME I SHOULD\nBE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL.\nI HAD A READER TELL ME I SHOULD BE DISQUALIFIED FROM COVERING\nTHE ELECTION BECAUSE OF MY ETHNICITY WHICH MIRRORS WHAT\nDONALD TRUMP SAID ABOUT THE JUDGE WITH THE UNIVERSITY CASE.\nAND A LOT OF THEM ADMIT THEY ARE TRUMP SUPPORTERS AND THEY ARE\nUSING HIS LANGUAGE AND BORROWING FROM THE SAME THINGS HE'S\nSAYING. >> AND YOU THINK THIS IS BECAUSE\nYOUR LAST NAME IS GOMEZ? >> IT'S OUT THERE ON MY BYLINE\nAND THEY HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING THIS OTHER THAN MY LAST NAME.\nI AM OF MEXICAN HERITAGE, I'M ALSO OF ITALIAN, GERMAN, AND\nIRISH HERITAGE BUT IT'S GOMEZ THAT APPEARS IN THE PAPER AND\nTHE E-MAILS AND TWEETS EMPHASIZE THE LAST NAME, THEY EMPHASIZE\nGOMEZ, THEY SAY I SHOULD GO BACK, MEAN DOG BACK TO MEXICO.\nSO IS IT TRUE I HAVE ANCESTORS FROM MEXICO, I'M PROUD OF THAT\nFACT. BUT THAT'S THE THING READERS ARE\nFIXING ON. >> WHICH MAKES IT A CHALLENGE,\nAS YOU DESCRIBED IN YOUR PIECE, OF COVERING THIS ELECTION.\nLET ME QUOTE YOU. \"IT STRIKES ME THAT TRUMP\nWHETHER HE MEANS TO OR NOT HAS FOSTER ADD HOSTILE MOMENT IN HIS\nPOLITICS WHEN HIS SUPPORTERS FEEL ENTITLED TO RACIALLY\nDENIGRATE OTHERS, SADLY, SIMPLY BEING A GOMEZ IS ENOUGH TO MAKE\nYOU A TARGET.\" LAST QUESTION, HENRY.\nHOW DO YOU THINK THIS ELECTION HAS CHANGED RACE RELATIONS IN\nAMERICA? >> WELL, I THINK YOU NAILED IT\nRIGHT THERE, HIS SUPPORTERS MAY HAVE FELT THIS WAY ALL ALONG BUT\nBECAUSE OF THE THINGS DONALD TRUMP IS SAYING THEY FEEL\nEMPOWERED AND EMBOLDENED TO SAY THIS OUT LOUD OR ATTACK\nSOMEBODY. IT'S NOT JUST REPORTERS, IT'S\nOTHERS, I FEEL THAT'S DIFFERENT. I COVERED THE ELECTION FOUR\nYEARS AGO AND NEVER RECEIVED THIS LEVEL OF VITRIOL FROM MY\nREADERS. THAT'S THE ONE THING THAT HAS\nCHANGED THIS YEAR AND I WONDER IF IT'S SOMETHING WE'LL SEE FOR\nYEARS TO COME IN PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS.\n>> FROM JOURNALIST TO JOURNALIST, I'M SORRY BUT KEEP\nCOVERING THIS ELECTION.

HOW BIG AN UPGRADE IS THIS?\nWHO SHOULD UPGRADE? >> WELL, I MEAN, I THINK --\nLOOK, THEY'VE -- IT'S AN EXCELLENT PHONE.\nIT WAS AN EXCELLENT PHONE LAST YEAR.\nIT WAS AN EXCELLENT PHONE THE YEAR BEFORE.\nIT'S PRETTY MUCH THE SAME EXTERIOR AS THOSE TWO, AS YOU\nKNOW, JOHN. THEY'VE ACTUALLY ADDED ON THE\nINSIDE A WHOLE BUNCH OF SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS, WHICH\nI WON'T RUN THROUGH ALL OF THEM. BATTERY LIFE, WATER RESISTANCE.\nMORE MEMORY AT EVERY PRICE POINT.\nBUT WHAT REALLY HANGS ME UP ON THIS THIS YEAR ARE TWO THINGS.\nONE IS THAT WE KNOW, OR AT LEAST THEY'RE STRONGLY HINTING THAT A\nBIG, RADICAL, AWESOME RESIGN OF THE KIND THAT WE HAVE BEEN USED\nTO COMING FROM APPLE FOR YEARS IS COMING NEXT YEAR.\nTHE REASON IT LOOKS THE SAME THIS YEAR, THEY WANTED TO TAKE\nTWO CYCLES TO DO SOMETHING FANTASTIC.\nSO, WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO BUY THIS ONE WHEN YOU MIGHT WANT TO\nWAIT TILL NEXT YEAR? THE SECOND THING IS -- AND WE'VE\nTALKED TO DEATH ABOUT THIS. BUT THEY'VE REMOVED THE\nHEADPHONE JACK. FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE, THAT'S A\nPAIN IN THE NECK T MEANS ALL THE HEADPHONES AND EAR BUDS THAT\nTHEY OWN WILL NO LONGER WORK OR WILL REQUIRE AN ADAPTER.\nTHEY'RE TRYING TO MOVE THE WORLD TO WIRELESS.\nTHEY'VE INVENTED THEIR OWN WIRELESS.\nI'M WEARING ONE OF THEM. IT'S THIS EAR POD THING.\n>> VERY FASHIONABLE, JUST TO HAVE IT IN ONE EAR.\n>> THAT'S THE POINT. IT LOOKS KIND OF LIKE A PLASTIC\nEARRING. BE HONEST WITH ME HERE.\n>> WELL -- >> AND IF THAT'S YOUR STYLE,\nTHAT'S COOL. FOR ALL I KNOW, MAYBE IT WILL\nBECOME SOMETHING EVERYONE WILL WANT TO WEAR.\nIT'S GOING TO COST $159 AND GIVE YOU TWO HOURS OF PHONE TALKING\nTIME BETWEEN CHARGES AND YOU'LL HAVE TO PUT THEM BACK IN THIS\nLITTLE CASE TO RECHARGE. THEY RECHARGE QUICKLY.\n>> HERE IS MY ISSUE WITH THE WAY APPLE HAS APPROACHED THIS\nHEADPHONE SOCKET THING AND THE WIRELESS THING.\nI APPRECIATE THAT THEY'VE GOT THIS W1 CHIP TO MAKE WIRELESS\nWORK MORE EASILY WITH FUTURE VERSIONS.\nTHEY'RE INTRODUCING THIS NEW CHIP AND TAKING THE HEADPHONE\nSOCKET OUT AT THE SAME TIME. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE IF THEY\nINTRODUCED IT A CYCLE AGO AND THEN TAKE IT AWAY, THE\nHEADPHONES, ONCE THEY'VE PROVEN THIS OUT.\nTO DO BOTH AT ONCE, ISN'T THAT KIND OF JARRING?\n>> I COMPLETELY AGREE.

WE AGREE WITH THEM THAT FIRMS\nSHOULD PAY THEIR TAXES. WHEN IT'S U.S. INCOME, WE THINK\nTHAT TAX SHOULD BE PAID IN THE UNITED STATES.\n>> MEANTIME, iPHONE 7 REVIEWS ARE OUT.\nAND THE VERDICT IS -- WELL, IT'S PRETTY MIXED.\nLIP TO THE 7 MAY BE WISE FOR SOME.\nUSA TODAY SAYS IF YOU CAN HOLD OUT, YOU SHOULD.\nSENIOR WRITER AND TONY SAKINATI. DEMAND IS FOUR TIMES THE\nPREVIOUS iPHONE. IS THAT PROOF POSITIVE, THAT\nTHIS WILL BE A REALLY BIG DEAL FOR APPLE?\n>> I THINK YOU HAVE TO KEEP THOSE DATA POINTS IN CONTEXT BUT\nTHEY'RE CLEARLY POSITIVE. FIRST, THERE ARE ONLY TWO\nCARRIERS. SECONDLY, ALL THE U.S. CARRIERS\nARE RUNNING VERY AGGRESSIVE PROMOTIONS WHERE YOU CAN TRADE\nIN AN OLD PHONE AND GET AN iPHONE 7 FOR FREE.\nWE DIDN'T SEE THESE KIND OF PROMOTIONS LAST YEAR.\nSO THE COMPARABLES A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.\nALL THAT SAID SPRINT AND T-MOBILE MIGHT ACCOUNT FOR 5% OF\nFLOEBL VOLUMES FOR APPLE. AFTER THE FIRST FOUR DAYS TO\nHAVE THOSE UP THREE TIMES ON 5% OF YOUR BASE IS CERTAINLY\nENCOURAGING. IT'S EARLY DAYS AND THE\nPROMOTIONS ARE DIFFERENT. >> AND BECAUSE WE WON'T GET MUCH\nSALES DATA FROM APPLE, IT WILL BE IMPORTANT TO DEDUCE FROM\nTHESE. WE JUST SPOKE TO WALT MOSSBERG\nABOUT THIS. THE APPEARANCE ISN'T THAT\nDIFFERENT. THE BIG FEATURES ARE THE CAMERA\nAND THINGS INSIDE. IF PEOPLE CAN'T SEE THE\nDIFFERENCE, CAN'T FEEL IT, WILL THAT BE AN OBSTACLE FOR THEM?\n>> YEAH, I HAVE TO SAY I LIKED HIS ONE EARRING LOOK WITH THE\nSINGLE EAR BUD. IT'S INTERESTING THAT THE\nBIGGEST DIFFERENCE IS ONE THAT'S GETTING A LOT OF SORT OF\nAMUSEMENT AND PUZZLEMENT, WHICH ARE THESE WIRELESS HEADPHONES OR\nEAR BUDS. I THINK THE BIGGEST THING GOING\nFOR IT IS THAT ITS PATRYS DON'T EXPLODE.\nTHAT DOESN'T BODE SO WELL. AS MOSSBERG SAID EARLIER, I\nTHINK PEOPLE ARE HOLDING OUT FOR WHAT GOING TO COME NEXT YEAR.\nEARLY NUMBERS, JUST LIKE TONI SAID, THEY'RE FROM T-MOBILE,\nSPRINT. IT DOESN'T ACCOUNT FOR SUCH A\nLARGE PERCENTAGE AND CUSTOMERS ARE BASICALLY BE ASKED TO SELL\nTHEIR SOULS FOR ANOTHER TWO YEARS TO DO THIS TRADE-IN.\nNOT SURE WHAT TO MAKE OF THE EARLY NUMBERS QUITE YET.\n>> GIVEN THAT THE 6S UPDATE WASN'T THAT HUGE JUST IN TERMS\nOF THE GROWTH THAT APPLE SAW FROM ONE GENERATION TO THE NEXT,\nIS THE BAR MAYBE NOT THAT HIGH FOR THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE 7?\nREVIEWS SAID IF YOU'RE HAPPY WITH THE 6, YOU DON'T HAVE TO\nUPGRADE TO THE 6S. THE REVIEWS SAY IF YOU'RE HAPPY\nWITH WHAT YOU HAVE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO UPGRADE TO THE 7.\nPEOPLE'S PHONES ARE GETTING OLD. MIGHT WE FINALLY GET THAT BUMP\nFROM THE UPGRADERS WHETHER THERE'S THAT REVIEW OR NOT?\n>> WE COULD. THAT'S THE MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR\nQUESTION. PHONES THAT ARE USED AND HAVE\nBEEN RESOLD. THAT INSTALL BASE IS 50% HIGHER\nENTERING THE iPHONE 7 CYCLE THAN IT WAS TWO YEARS AGO, ENTERING\nTHE iPHONE 6 CYCLE. CERTAINLY THE INSTALL BASE IS\nMUCH BIGGER. OUR BELIEF IS OVER TIME YOU\nSHOULD HAVE MORE iPHONE UNIT SALES.\nIT'S TRICKY TO KNOW HOW MANY MIGHT UPGREAT THIS YEAR AND HOW\nMANY MIGHT WAIT. TODAY IT'S ABOUT 80% ARE\nUPGRADING. THE DYNAMIC OF THE COMPOSITION\nOF WHO IS BUYING PHONES, TODAY IT'S ALL REPLACEMENT.\nFIVE YEARS AGO IT WAS LARGELY FIRST-TIME BUYERS.\n>> I HAVE TO SAY I'M ALMOST EMBARRASSED TO ADMIT THIS, BUT I\nAM STILL ON AN iPHONE 5. I WILL BE UPGRADING, BUT IT'S\nNOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE I'M THAT EXCITED ABOUT THIS NEW PHONE.\nI TOTALLY FIT INTO THAT DEMOGRAPHIC.\nIT'S EMBARRASSING AAS A TECH WRITER.\n>> SHE HAS A POINT. THAT LEADS TO MY FOLLOW-UP.\nWHY IS IT THAT PEOPLE UPGRADE TO THE 6S OR SE INSTEAD OF THE 7?\nANY WAY YOU HAVE OF CALCULATING THAT?\n>> AS FAR AS APPLE IS CONCERNED, PEOPLE BUYING NEW PHONES IS GOOD\nFOR THEIR BUSINESS. WHETHER THEY UPGRADE TO A 7 OR\niPHONE 6S, THE MARGINS ARE LIKELY PRETTY SIMILAR.\nTHE PLUS MODELS TEND TO HAVE BETTER MARGINS.\nTHE REVENUES ARE A BIT BETTER ON THE iPHONE 7 OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE\nOF THE HIGHER PRICES. BUT FOR APPLE AND FOR THE\nINVESTMENT COMMUNITY, IT'S REALLY NUMBER OF UNITS SOLD.\nAND I THINK APPLE HAS INCREASINGLY TRIED TO PROVIDE\nALTERNATIVES FOR CONSUMERS, WHETHER IT BE THE SE,\nONE-YEAR-OLD PHONE OR CURRENT MODEL PHONE.\nTHAT'S GOING TO BE THE DOMINANT DRIVER OF ITS ECONOMICS LESS SO\nTHE MYTHS. >> LEGAL BATTLE TO COME BETWEEN\nAPPLE AND THE EU. TREASURY SECRETARY WEIGHING IN\nTODAY. HE'S STARTING TO USE APPLE AS A\nCARROT FOR TAX REFORM. SURE IT'S A CONSUMER-FACING\nCOMPANY. IT HAS HOUSEHOLD NAME\nRECOGNITION. DO YOU THINK IT WILL WORK?\n>> I THINK IT COULD, ACTUALLY. I THINK IT'S REALLY INTERESTING\nTHAT, YOU KNOW, APPLE, WHICH WE USED TO LOOK AT JUST AS PRODUCT\nINNOVATION, RIGHT? THAT'S WHERE IT WAS TREND\nSETTING. NOW THE ATTENTION HAS BEEN MUCH\nMORE ON APPLE VERSUS THE FBI AND APPLE VERSUS THE EU.\nTHERE'S STILL A LOT THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN.\nI THINK IT WILL BE A TREND-SETTER IN TERMS OF TAX\nREFORM. SO, YES, A LOT COULD HAPPEN JUST\nBECAUSE OF WHAT APPLE HAS SORT OF STARTED AGAIN.\nTHIS TIME AROUND IT'S NOT ON THE PRODUCT INNOVATION SIDE, WHICH\nIS KIND OF FUNNY. >> TO BE CONTINUED.\nMICHAL LEV-RAM AND TONI, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.\n>>> WELLS FARGO ANNOUNCING BIG CHANGES FOR RETAIL BANKERS.\nTHE STOCK IS TAKING A HIT.",

THE FIRST WOULD BE THE MONTHLY\nREPORT TAKING DEMAND FORECASTS DOWN NOT JUST FOR THIS YEAR BUT\nNEXT YEAR, AS WELL. THE WALL STREET THESIS FOR THIS\nREBOUND THAT IS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN DEPENDS ON DEMAND STAYING\nAT LEAST FLAT OR TICKING UP. SO THAT'S NOT REALLY A GOOD\nSIGN. THE EQUITY PLUNGED TODAY AND\nALSO A LITTLE BIT OF STRENGTH IN THE DOLLAR NOT GOOD SIGNS FOR\nCRUDE OIL. INVENTORIES TOMORROW.\nREMEMBER LAST WEEK WE SAW A DRAW DOWN OF 14 MILLION BARRELS.\nSOME ARE LOOKING FOR A PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL BUILD.\nTHOSE ARE THE ONES WHO THINK LAST WEEK'S ACTION WAS A ONE OFF\nEVENT. THE BUILD FACTOR BEING PRICED\nINTO OIL PRICES TODAY. AS YOU CAN SEE THE EFFECT THAT\nIT HA. ONE REASON THAT WILL HOLD THE\nALGERIA MEETING. IT'S THE WILDCARD.\nBACK TO YOU. >> THANK YOU.\nKEEPING AN EYE ON THOSE CRUDE PRICES BELOW $45 A BARREL.\nTRACKING HIS BROADER SELL OFF AGAIN HERE.\n>> THIS IS ALL ABOUT WORRIES ABOUT THE FED POSSIBLY RAISING\nRATES. WE HAVE A RISK OFF DAY.\nWE HAVE A DOUBLE WHAMMY HITTING OIL STOCKS.\nWE HAVE GENERAL RISK OFF DAY. EXXON GETTING HIT.\nIT HAS BEEN A STALWART RECENTLY BUT BREAKING DOWN.\nIT IS AT THE LOWEST LEVEL SINCE APRIL.\n$85 YOU SEE RIGHT THERE. YOU WANT TO SEE A RISK OFF DAY?\nYOU HEARD THE TEN YEAR YIELD DROPPED OFF.\nNORMALLY THIS WOULD BE A BIG HELP TO BANK STOCKS.\nTHEY WOULD MOVE UP ON THAT. HOW MUCH IS THIS DEBATE WITH THE\nFED FREAKING OUT? IT HAS GONE 11 TO 18.\nLOOK AT THAT AT 18. HERE ARE THE SPEECHES FOR\nOCTOBER AND NOVEMBER. IT'S WHERE THE CASH IS RIGHT\nNOW. THAT'S A HUGE INCREASE IN THE\nVIX. WE HAVE FLATTENING IN THE VIX.\nWE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT IN A VERY LONG TIME.\nBACK TO YOU. >> BOB, THANK YOU.\nLET'S GET TO THE KEY POINT IN THE LAST COUPLE OF SESSIONS\nGOING BACK TO FRIDAY STOCKS AND BONDS BOTH SELLING OFF.\nI SAT DOWN WITH PAUL SINGER EARLIER TODAY AT DELIVERING\nALPHA AND SPOKE ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY FOR SELL OFF IN\nTANDEM TO CONTINUE. >> IT'S BEEN SO LONG IN THE\nMAKING THAT THE BOND PRICES ARE SO HIGH, INTEREST RATES ARE SO\nLOW THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO ASCERTAIN WHAT CHANGE IN\nTHINKING WILL GENERATE A GROUP THINK WITH A DIFFERENT VECTOR,\nTHINKING THAT BONDS ARE NOT THE SAFE HAVEN THAT BOTH STOCKS AND\nBONDS CAN GO DOWN. I THINK GO DOWN TOGETHER.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT AND WHAT HE SAID IN OUR \"CLOSING\nBELL\" EXCHANGE. MICHAEL FAR JOINS US FROM D.C.\nKEITH IS HERE AT POST NINE AND JACK BERUZIAN.\nTYPICALLY STOCKS GO DOWN AND THAT MEANS BONDS GO UP BECAUSE\nIT IS TAKING MONEY OUT OF ONE ASSET CLASS AND PUTTING IT IN\nANOTHER. >> PRETTY SIGNIFICANT ON THE\nSHORT TERM MOVE BASIS. ON THE LONGER TERM WE HAVE TO\nGET BACK TO A VERSION ON RELATIONSHIPS WE HAVE COME TO\nUNDERSTAND OVER THE LAST FIVE, TEN YEARS.\nTHEY HAVE DEFINITELY GOTTEN OUT OF WHACK.\nMR. SINGER IS RIGHT ON THAT. ON A SHORT TERM BASIS YOU ARE\nSEEING BOTH GO DOWN BECAUSE MARKETS ARE SO TEMPERAMENTAL.\nPART OF THAT IS WHAT MR. SINGER IS SAYING IS THAT ANY LITTLE\nMATCH OR FUSE WILL SET THEM OFF IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.\nYOU TAKE A LOOK AT OIL PRICES GOING DOWN, EQUITIES GOING DOWN,\nBONDS GOING DOWN. THAT IS A CLASSIC CONCERN STORY\nAND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE SEEING. THE MOVEMENTS HAVE BEEN SO\nDRAMATIC. ON FRIDAY WE HAD MARKETS.\nTHE VIX OVERBOUGHT. TODAY WE HAD THEM GETTING BACK\nTO NEUTRAL. TODAY THEY ARE VASTLY OVERSOLD.\nI THINK SHORT TERM THIS IS A VERY GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO START\nNIBBLING AROUND THE EDGES. >> WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THIS\nENVIRONMENT? >> HOLDING MY BREATH AND SEEING\nWHICH WAY THIS IS GOING TO SHAKE OUT.\nWE STARTED LAST WEEK AND THE MARKET DECLINED ON THE FED NEWS.\nI NEVER BELIEVED IT. I WROTE THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO\nHAVE A RATE HIKE BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR.\nI CONTINUE TO HOLD THAT POSITION.\nI THINK THAT THE UNCERTAINTY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEK IS\nPROBABLY MORE POLITICAL. I THINK THAT THE EXPECTATIONS\nFOR A CLINTON PRESIDENCY MIGHT HAVE BEEN UPSET SOME OVER THE\nWEEKEND AND I THINK THAT YOU ARE SEEING SOME TRADERS BEGIN TO\nVOTE WITH THEIR FEET. PARTICULARLY WITH MR. TRUMP'S\nCRITICISM OF FED CHAIRMAN YELLEN.\nWALL STREET HAS A LOT TO DIGEST COMING INTO THE BEGINNING OF\nTHIS WEEK. >> THERE WAS A BIT OF A DEBATE\nON FRIDAY ABOUT THE SELLOFF THAT DAY WHETHER IT WAS ABOUT THE FED\nOR ABOUT NORTH KOREA. NOW WE THINK MAYBE THE ELECTION.\nWE'RE AT 173 ON THE TEN YEAR. WHAT IS THAT ALL ABOUT?\n>> COMBINATION OF ALL OF THE ABOVE.\nONE OF THE SOUND BYTES IS WHEN SINGER SAID NOTHING IS WORKING\nWHEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT CENTRAL BANKS.\nI THINK THAT WAS SO INSIGHTFUL. RIGHT NOW THAT SEEMS TO BE ONE\nOF THESE OPINIONS THAT IS CREEPING INTO THE MENTALITY OF\nTHE INVESTING PUBLIC. OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST\nCOUPLE OF MONTHS WE HAVE GONE THROUGH THE LOW VOLATILE\nENVIRONMENT. WE SAW PEOPLE CHASING RETURNS,\nCHASING YIELD AND STARTED GETTING INTO STOCKS, TREATING\nTHEM LIKE BONDS. NOW THEY ARE GETTING THE\nVOLATILITY BACK AND WHEN MICHAEL FAR SAID IS RIGHT.\nTHEY START TO SMELL THE ELECTION AND ALL OF THOSE UNCERTAINTIES.\nBEFORE YOU KNOW IT WE HAVE A BIG MOVE IN THE MARKETS.\nI THINK FRIDAY WAS THE BEGINNING OF SOMETHING.\nFRIDAY MIGHT BE THE START OF WHAT IN HIND SIGHT WE WILL LOOK\nAT AS THE BEGINNING OF A MOVE DOWN.\nIT STARTED AROUND THIS LEVEL LAST YEAR.\nWE MADE A HIGH OF 2135. WE ARE RIGHT THERE AGAIN NOW.\nLET'S SEE IF I'M RIGHT Y. HAVE A FEELING.\nI HAVE A FEELING THESE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS CAN BE VERY\nDANGEROUS. >> PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TELLING US\nFOR SOME TIME IF INTEREST RATES MOVE HIGHER IT COULD HELP THE\nSTOCK MARKET. IF THE TEN YEAR MOVES UP TO 2%\nDO YOU EXPECT STOCKS WOULD FIND THEIR FOOTING OR IS THIS THE\nKIND OF ENVIRONMENT WE HAVE BEEN LAYING OUT WHERE UNFORTUNATELY\nTHEY WOULD BE SELLING OFF IN THAT ENVIRONMENT?\n>> ONLY IF MOVE TO 2% IS BASED ON ECONOMIC FUNDAMENTALS.\nONE THOUGHT I DIDN'T COMPLETE WAS ONE REASON THAT YOU ARE\nSEEING THE MARKET GO DOWN WHILE THE TEN YEAR YIELD IS GOING UP\nIS THAT IT IS A GLOBAL GROWTH CONCERN STORY BUT ALSO A CONCERN\nTHAT CENTRAL BANKS ARE TAPPED OUT AND JUST CAN'T DO MORE.\nTHAT IS WHAT JACK WAS ALLUDING TO.\nTHAT IS WHERE YOU ARE GETTING THE STORM HAPPENING TODAY.\nI WILL GO BACK AND SAY FOR THE LONGER TERM I THINK WE WILL SEE\nWEAKNESS IN THIS. SEPTEMBER IS ALWAYS A VOLATILE\nMONTH. ON THE SHORTER TERM I THINK\nTHERE ARE EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITIES TO STEP IN HERE.\nNEXT WEEK WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT RAISING RATES AND GOING TO\nGIVE US DOVISH LANGUAGE THEN YOU SEE THE MARKET RALLY AGAIN.\n>> WE HAVE A LOT TO GET TO. THANK YOU ALL.\nGOOD TO SEE YOU. >> FROM THE MACRO TO MICROSAYS\nHE IS SHORTING ALIBABA. TAKE A LISTEN.\n>> PEOPLE HAVE COMPARED AMAZON TO ALIBABA AND IT COULDN'T BE\nFURTHER FROM THE TRUTH.

SPECIFIC TO THE QUESTIONS AND\nCRITICISM THIS IS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY.\n>> THE PROBLEM IS HE DOESN'T SEEM TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE\nBUSINESS AND TRY TO APPRECIATE THE POWER OF THE DIGITAL ECONOMY\nIN CHINA. AND YOU CAN LAY A LOT OF CLAIMS\nAND ACCUSATIONS ON OUR BUSINESS. ON THE LOGISTICS BUSINESS WE\nMADE FULL DISCLOSURE ON THE PROFITS, LOSS, REVENUES, ASSETS,\nLIABILITIES OF THE BUSINESS.

THERE WE GO.\nSO DAVID AND JIM JUST SAT DOWN WITH MR. SY.\nLET'S GO TO DELIVERING ALPHA AND LISTEN IN.\n>> NOTED SHORT TELLER. >> WAS HE HERE?\n>> HE WAS HERE. AND HE'S -- HE'S BEEN GOING\nAFTER ALIBABA A BIT AND I WOULD LOVE TO GET YOUR RESPONSE.\nTHIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT.\nOFTENTIMES, JOE, WE INTERVIEW YOU FROM FAR AWAY WITH A LONG\nDELAY. THIS IS REFRESHING TO HAVE SOME\nTIME TO HAVE A CONVERSATION. >> RIGHT.\n>> SPECIFIC TO THE OWNERSHIP STAKE THAT YOU HAVE IN THE\nDELIVERY BUSINESS, WHICH HE CALLS IT BEING UNCONSOLIDATED,\nI'M QUOTING HERE, THEY ONLY 48 OR 49% OF IT, BUT THAT'S EVEN\nDECEPTIVE BECAUSE THE ACTUAL COMPANIES THAT -- IT IS THE\nCHINESE MODEL, YOU NEVER SEE EVERYTHING, AND YET WHAT YOU DO\nSEE IS THE CASH GOING OUT THE DOOR, NOT COMING IN THE DOOR,\nAND ACCELERATING GOING OUT THE DOOR RELATIVE TO THE SIZE OF\nTHE, QUOTE, EVEN THOUGH THE BUSINESS IS GROWING.\nAND THAT'S CONCERNING. WHAT IS THE RESPONSE FROM\nALIBABA WHEN YOU HEAR SOMETHING LIKE THAT FROM SOMEBODY WHO HAS\nA FOLLOWING ON WALL STREET? >> IS HE STILL HERE?\nDO I SEE HIM? >> HE'S NOT.\n>> ANYWAY -- >> HE'S LEFT THE BUILDING.\n>> SO I THINK WHEN YOU'RE IN THE SHORT SELLING BUSINESS, IT IS A\nI HAVE TOUGH BUSINESS. WHEN YOU'RE WRONG, THE -- THE\nDOWNSIDE IS UNLIMITED. I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR JIM\nCHANOS, ALL RIGHT. BUT I THINK THE PROBLEM IS, HE\nDOESN'T SEEM TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE BUSINESS AND TRY\nTO APPRECIATE THE POWER, THE DIGITAL ECONOMY IN CHINA.\nAND YOU CAN LAY A LOT OF CLAIMS, A LOT OF ACCUSATIONS ON OUR\nBUSINESS, THE BOTTOM LINE IS ON THE LOGISTICS BUSINESS, WE MADE\nFULL DISCLOSURE ON THE PROFITS, LOSS, REVENUES, ASSETS,\nLIABILITIES OF THE BUSINESS. SO INVESTORS CAN DO THEIR OWN\nMATH. WHETHER YOU'RE CONSOLIDATED OR\nNOT CONSOLIDATED. YOU TALK ABOUT CASH FLOW, WE\nOVER THE LAST 12 MONTHS BOUGHT BACK $5 BILLION OF STOCK, OUR\nOWN STOCK, AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S CASH THAT WE -- REAL CASH WE\nRETURN TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. SO I THINK WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED\nTHAT OUR BUSINESS IS EXTREMELY CASH FLOW GENERATIVE.\nTHAT WE'RE GOOD STEWARDS OF CAPITAL.\nI WOULD LIKE TO INVITE JIM CHANOS TO COME AND SEE OUR\nCAMPUS, SEE OUR BUSINESS SO WE CAN REALLY EXPLAIN OUR BUSINESS\nTO HIM. I THINK, YOU KNOW, THE PROBLEM\nWITH WHAT IS GOING ON IS SINCE HE'S BEEN TALKING DOWN OUR STOCK\nSEVERAL MONTHS AGO OR LAST YEAR, OUR STOCK HAS BEEN UP 50%.\n>> IT HAS. >> YOU GOT TO PAY A LOT OF\nRESPECT TO HIM, YOU ANY, TO WITHSTAND THAT KIND OF PAIN.\n>> IT IS NEVER EASY TO BE SHORT. AND IN THAT CASE AS WELL.\nHE DID MAKE THE CORRELATION TO EBAY, WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THE\nONE MADE IN THE BARON STORY, THAT YOU GUYS VERY STRONGLY\nREBUTTED AND I WOULD ARGUE SUCCESSFULLY GIVEN WHAT YOU JUST\nPOINTED OUT IS THE VERY STRONG PERFORMANCE OF THE STOCK.\nWHY, THOUGH, IS THAT NOT A CORRECT PARALLEL TO MAKE IN\nTERMS OF MULTIPLE, IN TERMS OF A BISSETING, GETTING TOGETHER\nBUYERS AND SELLERS AS EBAY DOES HERE.\n>> LAST QUARTER WE GREW 59% OF REVENUES.\nWHAT IS EBAY'S GROWTH RATE, SINGLE DIGITS, THAT MAKES ALL\nTHE DIFFERENCE. WE'RE IN A MARKET IN THE\nCONFLUENCE OF HIGH GROWTH OF THE CHINESE ECONOMY, AS WELL AS, YOU\nKNOW, TECHNOLOGY. AND THAT'S VERY, VERY EXCITING\nFOR US. SO IN CHINA TODAY, WHAT YOU'RE\nSEEING IS CONSUMERS ARE SHIFTING THEIR PURCHASES ONLINE, BUT\nTHERE IS GOING TO BE MORE GROWTH IN CONSUMPTION BECAUSE CHINA HAS\nA RELATIVELY LOW PERCENTAGE OF GDP THAT IS LEVERAGED TO\nCONSUMPTIONS, ABOUT 40%. THE MORE DEVELOPED THE ECONOMIES\nARE 60%, 70%, AND IF YOU LOOK AT AVERAGE CHINESE CONSUMER,\nTHEY'RE IN NET CASH POSITION. THERE IS NET NET 4.6 TRILLION\nU.S. DOLLARS OF NET CASH SAVINGS ON THE BALANCE SHEET OF CHINESE\nHOUSEHOLDS. TO GIVE YOU A CONTEXT TO THAT\nNUMBER, THE AVERAGE AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD AN AGGREGATE HAS $11\nTRILLION OF MORTGAGE DEBT. SO WE'RE LEVERAGED TO THE\nCONSUPTION AND ECONOMY AND THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE\nLOW GROWTH AND ENVIRONMENT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES.\n>> WE WANT TO GET TO BROADER DISCUSSION OF CHINA AND KNOW MY\nPARTNER HERE HAS A LOT OF QUESTIONS.\nON THIS QUESTION OF CONSOLIDATING OUR NOT THE\nDELIVERY BUSINESS, AMAZON IS A NAME WE WOULD IMMEDIATELY THINK\nOF AS FULL CONTROL OVER ITS DISTRIBUTION.\nWHY NOT CONSOLIDATE? WHY NOT OWN IT OUTRIGHT?\nWHAT IS THE STRATEGY THERE BY WHICH YOU DO OWN 48 OR 49?\n>> IF WE OWNED THE WHOLE BUSINESS OUTRIGHT, WE WOULD HAVE\nTO MANAGE ABOUT 2 MILLION PEOPLE.\nAND WE JUST DON'T THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT A TECHNOLOGY\nCOMPANY SHOULD DO. OKAY.\nSO CURRENTLY, YOU KNOW, IF YOU HAVE TO APPRECIATE THE SCALE OF\nOUR BUSINESS. ON A DAILY BASIS, OUR PLATFORMS\nGENERATE ABOUT 40 MILLION PACKAGES PER DAY THAT NEED TO BE\nDELIVERED. JUST TO PUT THAT NUMBER IN\nCONTEXT, I THINK AMAZON IN THE UNITED STATES HANDLES SOMEWHERE\nAROUND 5 MILLION TO 6 MILLION PACKAGES, OKAY.\nAND SOY LOOK AT TWO MILLION PEOPLE IN OUR ESKOU SYSTEM THAT\nARE MANAGING THE WAREHOUSES AND ALSO DELIVERING PACKAGES ON THE\nSTREETS, IF YOU COMBINE THE ENTIRE WORKFORCE OF FEDEX AND\nU.P.S., THAT'S 600,000 PEOPLE. SO DO YOU WANT TO GO OUT AND BUY\nFEDEX AND U.P.S.? I DON'T THINK SO.\nWE'RE A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY. WE'RE NOT A LABOR INTENSIVE\nCOMPANY. >> ALL RIGHT, LET ME GO INTO\nMORE THAN JUST CHANOS. >> WE HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO JOE\nTSAI, RESPONDING DIRECTLY TO SHORT SELLER JIM CHANOS' SHORT\nPOSITION IN THE COMPANY. WE SHOULD REMIND YOU THAT\nALIBABA SHARES ARE UP 54% OVER THE PAST 12 MONTHS.\nMORE VE DEVELOPMENTS AS THEY CO. >>> TREASURY SECRETARY JACK LEW\nWEIGHED IN THIS MORNING FROM DELIVERING ALPHA.\n>> IT IS BAD BEHAVIOR, THEY WERE",

HIS COMMENTS AND THE CFO'S\nCOMMENTS YESTERDAY MORNING ON A CONFERENCE CALL SUGGEST THIS WAS\nLOWER LEVEL EMPLOYEES WHO DID WRONG.\nTHEY DIDN'T WANT IT TO HAPPEN. >> BUT WHO WAS SUPERVISING?\n>> THAT'S THE POINT. THEY'RE NOT SAYING WE NEED TO\nGIVE BACK CHUNKS OF THE BONUS AND THINGS LIKE THAT.\n>> JIM ASKED ABOUT THAT. HE WOULDN'T GO THERE.\nHE SAID IT IS A BOARD MATTER SAYING MAYBE THERE WAS SOME\nDISCUSSION ABOUT THAT. >> SO MAYBE NOT A FULL MEA\nCULPA, BUT HE SAID THE BUCK STOPS WITH ME.\nWE'LL BE UNDER MORE PRESSURE NEXT WEEK.\nHE SAID HE WILL GO TO THAT SENATE HEARING.\nTHIS STORY WILL NOT END. THE PREMARKET AT LEAST, THEIR\nSHARE PRICE IS UP. >> JACK LEW SAYING -- HE\nWOULDN'T COMMENT TOO MUCH, SAID THE CLAW BACK WAS A CONSUMER\nPROTECTION ISSUE, BUT THAT IT WAS A WAKE-UP CALL TO THE\nPERSONS OF THIS ISSUE OF DODD-FRANK, AND SOME SAYING IT\nSHOULD BE ABOLISHED BUT IT WAS ALSO CULTURE PROBLEMS AT WELLS\nFARGO. >> HE ALSO SAID NO ONE IS TOO\nBIG TO JAIL AS WELL. NOT SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT\nTHIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. BUT SOMETHING TO BE AWARE OF.\n>> GIANTS OF INVESTING BUSINESS AND POLICY HAD WARNINGS FOR\nINVESTORS AT THE DELIVERING ALPHA CONFERENCE IN NEW YORK\nYESTERDAY. PAUL SINGER, PRESIDENT OF\nELLIOTT MANAGEMENT, ARGUING THAT CENTRAL BANKERS ARE TO BLAME FOR\nTHE SLOW ECONOMY.  >> EIGHT YEARS OF EVER-DECLINING\nRATES AND EVER-INCREASING RADICALISM IN OTHER MONETARY\nPOLICIES HAVE NOT CREATED A SUSTAINABILITY ACCELERATING\nUPTICK IN GROWTH WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IS CREATED A TREMENDOUS\nINCREASE IN HIDDEN RISK. RISK THAT INVESTORS DON'T\nEXACTLY KNOW OR FACED ABOUT THEIR HOLDINGS.\nI THINK IT'S A DANGEROUS TIME IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND GLOBAL\nFINANCIAL MARKETS. >> BLACKSTONE'S CEO STEVEN\nSWARTZMAN OFFERING A LESS THAN OPTIMISTIC STONE SAYING STOCKS\nARE OVERVALUED HERE AS INTEREST RATES GIVE THEM A LIFT.\nHE ALSO JOKED AROUND WHEN GIVING HIS PREDICTION THAT FED\nPOLICYMAKERS MAY REACT SOON OUT OF BOREDOM.\n>> PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS ON TELEVISION FOR SO\nMANY YEARS, THAT THE FED MAY DO SOMETHING OUT OF THE BOREDOM OF\nIT ALL. >> WE'RE DARING THEM.\n>> RIGHT. YOU'RE DARING THEM REPEATEDLY,\nEVENTUALLY THEY'LL GIVE UP AND DO SOMETHING.\n25 BASIS POINTS WILL MOVE MARKETS ONLY BECAUSE YOU ALL\nHAVE BECOME A PROXY FOR THE MARKETS.\nYOU WANTED TO MOVE SOMETHING. OR ELSE THERE'S NO NEWS. AND -- BUT IT WON'T MAKE A\nDIFFERENCE TO THE U.S. ECONOMY. >> WE ALSO HEARD FROM RAY DALIO\nWHO SAID THE DEBT MARKET IS IN A DANGEROUS SITUATION AS CENTRAL\nBANKS AROUND THE WORLD LOSE THEIR ABILITY TO STIMULATE\nGROWTH. >> THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH YOU CAN\nSQUEEZE OUT OF A DEBT CYCLE. WE'RE THERE GLOBALLY.\nWHEN YOU CAN'T LOWER INTEREST RATES ANYMORE, WE KNOW THE POWER\nOF HAVING THE EFFECT ON ASSET PRICE IS GOING UP BECAUSE\nINTEREST RATES GO DOWN. IN OTHER WORDS, THEY HAVE A\nPRESENT VALUE EFFECT THAT CAUSES INTEREST RATES TO CAUSE ASSET\nPRICES, AND WE'RE REACHING THAT LIMIT.\nTHE INABILITY TO PRODUCE STIMULATION BY LOWERING INTEREST RATES IS AT A LIMIT.\n>> THE HEAVY HITTERS WITH A HEAVY DOSE OF ECONOMIC\nPESSIMISM. A LOT OF BLAME ON CENTRAL BLANKS\nFOR WHAT PAUL SINGER CALLED CENTRAL BANK EXTREMISM.\nWHAT DO YOU DO WITH THAT INFORMATION?\nSINGER SAID YOU AVOID G-7 BONDS. THEY ARE NOT SAFE.\nTHE IDEA THAT THEY'RE SAFE HAVENS IS COMPLETELY WRONG.\nIT ALMOST FELT LIKE YOU NEEDED A CENTRAL BANKER THERE TO DEFEND\nTHEMSELVES AGAINST THE BIG HEDGE FUND PLAYERS.\n>> RAY DALIO'S POINT IS THE BEARISH ONE.\nWE WERE TOUCHING ON IT EARLIER LOOKING AT THE BOND YIELD\nCHARTS. HE'S SAYING THAT'S DUE TO THE\nLACK OF EFFICACY NOW THAT THE CENTRAL BANK'S ABILITY TO DO\nANYTHING IS SLIPPING AWAY. IN THE U.S., IF YIELDS ARE\nTICKING UP BECAUSE RATES ARE GOING UP, THAT'S LESS OF A\nWORRY, BUT HE'S SUGGESTING THAT'S NOT THE REASON BUT THAT\nCENTRAL BANKS HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO DO.\nTHE SINGER AND DALIO AGREEMENTS AGREE WITH WHAT TRUMP WAS\nSAYING, THAT THEY PROPPED UP THE MARKETS ARTIFICIALLY.\n>> I HAVE TO SAY, THERE WAS MORE WARNINGS AND WORRY FROM THESE\nHEDGE FUND MANAGERS ABOUT SLOW GROWTH AND LACK OF EFFICACY FROM\nCENTRAL BANKERS THAN THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT IN THE\nU.S. DONALD TRUMP, WE TRIED TO GET\nTHAT OUT OF A LOT OF OUR PANELISTS, BUT WE DIDN'T GET TOO\nMUCH. DON FITZPATRICK SAID WE NEED TO\nPAY MORE TO THE ELECTIONS HERE THAN THE CENTRAL BANKS\nOBSESSIONS. >> WE'LL BRING YOU MORE OPINIONS\nFROM YESTERDAY THROUGHOUT THE SHOW.\n>>> STOCKS TO WATCH TODAY.",

SINGER AND KELLY.\n>> HOW SERIOUS IS THE SITUATION TODAY?\n>> I THINK WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF CLOSE TO A 40-YEAR EXPERIMENT\nIN HOW LEVERAGED CAN A SYSTEM BE AND IN HOW MANY WAYS.\nTHE GLOBAL DERIVITIVES MARKET IS SOMETHING LIKE $700 TRILLION.\nOF COURSE, THAT DOESN'T EXACTLY REPRESENT A PROXY FOR RISK.\nBETWEEN THE FACT THAT 75% OF THAT IS INTEREST RATE\nDERIVITIVES AND THAT IN 5,000-ISH YEARS OF HISTORY THERE\nHAVE NEVER BEEN INTEREST RATES REMOTELY CLOSE TO WHERE WE ARE\nNOW CAUSES ME TO THINK THAT THIS LONG DOWN TREND IN INTEREST\nRATES, WHICH NOW HAVE SOMETHING LIKE 30% FIXED INCOME TRADING AT\nZERO OR WEIRDLY BELOW DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT HASN'T WORKED.\nTHEY SAY IT HAS WORKED AND WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT IT, MEANING\nCENTRAL BANKERS AND THOSE WHO APOLOGIZE AND THOSE WHO SUPPORT\nAND CHEER ON CENTRAL BANKERS, THEY SAY, WELL, GROWTH HASN'T\nREALLY PICKED UP. BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF WHAT WE'RE\nDOING, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT WORSE.\nI DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S POSSIBLY RIGHT AS FAR AS IT\nGOES. WHAT I MEAN BY FISCAL, I'LL\nEXPLAIN. FISCAL POLICIES THAT WOULD\nRESTORE LEVELS OF GROWTH SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THOSE\nDESCRIBED BY RAY DALIO AND TIM GEITNER, RESTORE THAT TO THE\nDEVELOPED WORLD IN THE ABSENCE OF FISCAL POLICIES IN TAX\nREGULATION, TRADE, EDUCATION POLICIES THAT WOULD DEAL WITH\nTHE CONSEQUENCES OF TECHNOLOGICAL -- IN THE ABSENCE\nOF THOSE POLICIES, SURE. MONETARY POLICY IS THE ONLY GAME\nIN TOWN. BUT EIGHT YEARS OF EFFORT\nEVER-DECLINING RATES AND EVER-INCREASING RADICALISM IN\nOTHER MONETARY POLICIES HAVE NOT CREATED A SUSTAINABLE,\nACCELERATING UPTICK IN GROWTH. WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IS CREATED A\nTREMENDOUS INCREASE IN HIDDEN RISK, RISK THAT INVESTORS DON'T\nEXACTLY KNOW OR HAVE FACED ABOUT THEIR HOLDINGS.\nAND I THINK IT'S A VERY DANGEROUS TIME IN THE GLOBAL\nECONOMY AND GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS.\n>> AND BY WAY OF REMINDING PEOPLE AS WELL OF 2007, WHEN I\nREAD IN JULIAN TUTT'S ACCOUNT, YOU SAT WITH THE G7, CORRECT,\nAND TOLD THEM OF YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE MARKET AT THAT POINT\nAND SAID WE LOOK AT A LOT OF THESE EXOTIC MORTGAGE\nINSTRUMENTS AND LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENING AND THINK THE BANKS\nARE ULTIMATELY GOING TO HAVE HUGE PROBLEMS AND THEY'RE\nOVERLEVERAGED AND WE WANT TO WARN YOU ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN.\nGEITNER AND OTHERS WERE IN THE ROOM, AS I UNDERSTAND, AND SORT\nOF SAID OKAY. SO, EVEN FOR PEOPLE TODAY, WHO\nMIGHT HAVE HEARD YOUR WARNINGS BEFORE, WOULD YOU SAY NOW WE'RE\nAT A POINT LIKE IN '07 WHEN THAT INDEX WAS CRACKING, WHEN YOU SEE\nBOND MARKETS CRACKING? IS NOW THAT POINT?\nIS THAT ENOUGH TO WARN PEOPLE TODAY LIKE YOU WOULD HAVE WANTED\nTO WARN THEM BACK IN 2007? >> A COMMENT OR TWO ABOUT THAT\nTIME AND THAT EPISODE. IT WASN'T JUST MYSELF AND JIMMY\nCHANOS. I PERMANENTLY WENT TO GERMANY\nBECAUSE WE HAD SEVERAL RELATIONSHIPS IN THE FINANCE, IT\nWAS PRACTITIONORS THAT HAD A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE\nTHE FINANCIAL SYSTEM WAS IN TERMS OF RISKS.\nTHE SECOND THING THAT STRUCK ME ABOUT THAT IS THE AMAZING\nARROGANCE OF THE POLICY MAKERS. THEY DIDN'T LISTEN.\nTHEY TREATED US AS IF WE WERE IGNORANT CHILDREN AND, OF\nCOURSE, THEY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. NEITHER DID THE GERMAN POLICY\nMAKERS, PARENTHETICALLY. BUT AFTER THE CRASH, IT'S ALL\nBEEN ONE WAY. THE EMERGENCY ACTION FOLLOWING\nTHE CRASH DESPITE THE FACT THAT CENTRAL BANKERS, INCLUDING, OF\nCOURSE, THE FED, HAD NO IDEA OF THE RISKS THAT WERE BUILDING,\nHAD NO IDEA OF THE VULNERABILITY OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO\nTHE CONFLUENCE OF THESE RISKS, THE STRUCTURED PRODUCTS, REAL\nESTATE BOOM ALL IN SORT OF A SELF REINFORCING DANCE, THEY HAD\nNO IDEA ABOUT THAT AND SO, TO ME, THE CREDIBILITY OF THE FED\nAND THE TREASURY, BUT THE FED GOING FORWARD WAS SEVERELY\nCHALLENGED. BUT THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF\nTHE CRASH POLICY WAS APPROPRIATE, REDUCE INTEREST\nRATES SHARPLY. STAND READY TO SUPPLY LIQUIDITY\nIN THE MIDST OF A CRASH. WELL, THE CRASH PERIOD, YOU\nKNOW, OCCURRED OVER A PERIOD OF ITS MOST INTENSE PHASE, IN A\nPERIOD OF WEEKS OR MONTHS. BY THE MIDDLE OF 2009, IT WAS\nTIME FOR A PIVOT. AND NO COUNTRY IN THE DEVELOPED\nWORLD -- AND I'M TALKING ABOUT JAPAN, EUROPE, THE UK, THE\nUNITED STATES. NO COUNTRY ACTUALLY MADE THE\nPIVOT TO THE OTHER POLICIES THAT COULD MAKE THE ECONOMY -- THAT\nCOULD RESTORE GROWTH, THAT COULD CURE THE STRUCTURAL IMPEDIMENTS\nTO GROWTH AND BRING GROWTH BACK TO SOMETHING CLOSE TO THE\nPREVIOUSLY EXPERIENCED LEVELS OF GROWTH.\nI BELIEVE THAT -- I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT IT'S JUST NOT THE\nCASE THAT THE DEVELOPED WORLD -- LET'S TALK ABOUT THE UNITED\nSTATES -- IS LIMITED TO AN ASSUMPTION OF 1 1/2 OR 2% PER\nYEAR REAL GROWTH GOING FORWARD. AND I CERTAINLY DON'T BELIEVE\nTHAT IF IT IS LIMITED IT'S BECAUSE OF DEMOGRAPHICS.\n>> SO YOU THINK IT COULD GROW AT 4% TO 5%?\n>> NO, BUT SOMETHING MORE THAN THIS 2% THAT AMERICA IS STUCK\nIN. >> ARE WE POSSIBLY AT THAT PIVOT\nPOINT IN THE U.S. NOW, FISCALLY SPEAKING?\nSHOULD DONALD TRUMP BE ELECTED PRESIDENT?\n>> WELL, I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT POLITICS AT THIS JUNCTURE.\nIN TWO MONTHS OR SO, WE'LL KNOW THE ANSWER TO THE -- WHICH\nENVELOPE OR IF BOTH OF THESE PEOPLE ARE STILL ON THE STAGE AT\nTHAT TIME. BUT WHAT I DO BELIEVE IS THAT\nPRO GROWTH POLICIES ARE POLICIES THAT COULD AND WOULD INCREASE\nGROWTH. FOR EXAMPLE, I BELIEVE IT WOULD\nHAVE BEEN VASTLY DIFFERENT FOR THE GROWTH RATE OF THE AMERICAN\nECONOMY AND THE PROBLEM OF UNDEREMPLOYMENT AND UNEMPLOYMENT\nAND THE REDUCTION IN THE LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION RATE, WHICH\nIS EVERY BIT AS IMPORTANT, PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE\nHEADLINE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, HAD MITT ROMNEY BEEN ELECTED\nPRESIDENT. THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A NUMBER\nOF POLICIES IN TAX REGULATION AND THINGS THAT I TALKED ABOUT A\nCOUPLE OF MINUTES AGO, THAT WOULD HAVE GENERATED A HIGHER\nRATE OF GROWTH AS DISTINGUISHED FROM THE CONTINUATION --\n>> FASCINAING DISCUSSION WITH ELLIOTT SINGER, TALKING ABOUT\nTHE CREDIBILITY OF THE FED, VARIOUS POLICIES THAT HE\nBELIEVED MIGHT HAVE TAKEN US -- AND MIGHT STILL TAKE THE ECONOMY\nTO A HIGHER GROWTH RATE THAN IT CURRENTLY HAS.\nARGUING ALSO THAT THE ARGUMENT FROM POLICY MAKERS THAT THINGS\nWOULD HAVE BEEN WORSE HAD THEY NOT ACTED AS THEY HAD, IN HIS\nWORDS PERHAPS IS NOT EXACTLY RIGHT.\nDOW CONTINUES IN THE SELLOFF DOWN 234.\nWHEN WE COME BACK, A LOT MORE FROM DELIVERING ALPHA, INCLUDING\nBEST IDEAS PANEL FROM SOME OF THE TOP NAMES IN INVESTING.\nMORE ON APPLE, SOME PREORDER NUMBERS ARE OUT.\nSECRETARY LEW MAKING HEADLINES ON EU TAXES AND MORE.\nDON'T GO AWAY.",

ALL RIGHT, LET'S START WITH --\nFORGET THE FOUNDATION FOR A SECOND.\nTHE BEGINNING OF THIS WAS A SIMPLE QUESTION, DONALD TRUMP'S\nA BILLIONAIRE, A RICH GUY. RICH PEOPLE TEND TO GIVE MONEY\nTO CHARITY WHETHER THEY'RE GENEROUS OR NOT, JUST A THING\nTHAT RICH PEOPLE DO.

I'VE CALLED THOSE GROUPS.\nTHAT'S HOW WE STARTED. >> YOU'RE 1 FOR 326 ON THAT, AM\nI RIGHT ABOUT THAT? >> YES.\n>> CAN YOU SHOW US THE NOTEPAD. YOU'VE BEEN TRACKING THIS ON\nTHIS WEIRDLY ICONIC NOTEPAD.

LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PAINTING\nFIRST. YOU TALKED ABOUT THIS A BIT, BUT\nHOW DID FOUNDATION MONEY FROM OTHER PEOPLE END UP IN A\nPAINTING OF DONALD TRUMP? >> WELL, IN 2007, DONALD TRUMP\nGOES TO A PARTY AT MAR-A-LAGO, HIS CLUB IN FLORIDA.\nAND THE ENTERTAINMENT FOR THE NIGHT -- THIS WAS A CHARITY\nGALA, A GALA PUT ON BY A CHARITY.\nTHE ENTERTAINMENT FOR THE NIGHT IS A SPEED PAINTER.\nHE PAINTS ONE PAINTING EVERY FIVE MINUTES.\nA FRENETIC SHOW. IN THE END HE FLIPS THE PAINTING\nOVER, YOU FIND OUT WHO HE'S BEEN PAINTING.\nBOOM, IT'S DONALD TRUMP. THEN THEY AUCTION OFF THE\nPAINTING. NOBODY BUT MELANIA TRUMP BIDS.\n$10,000. NOBODY ELSE IS CHALLENGING HER\nFOR THIS PAINTING. THE AUCTIONEER SAID, HEY, YOU\nSHOULD REALLY BID $20,000. YOU'RE MELANIA TRUMP.\nSHE GETS THE SIX-FOOT-TALL PAINTING OF DONALD TRUMP.\nLATER WHEN THE TIME COMES TO PAY, DONALD TRUMP PAYS USING THE\nTRUMP FOUNDATION'S MONEY. SO HE USED MONEY MEANT FOR\nCHARITY IN 2007, ALMOST ALL OF THE MONEY IN THAT FOUNDATION WAS\nFROM OTHER PEOPLE. ANYWAY, ONCE IT GOES IN, IT'S\nSUPPOSED TO BE USED FOR CHARITY. HE USES IT TO BUY A PAINTING FOR\nHIMSELF, WHICH IS AGAINST THE LAW.\nYOU CAN'T USE YOUR CHARITY'S MONEY TO BUY ITEMS FOR YOURSELF.\n>> NOW, IN TERMS OF CLEARING ALL THIS UP, RIGHT, THIS IS SOMEONE\nWHOSE FINANCIAL DEALINGS ARE COMPLICATED.\nARE THERE DOCUMENTS YOU COULD SEE THAT WOULD JUST SORT OF MAKE\nALL THIS CRYSTAL CLEAR JUST TO CLEAR UP THIS SORT OF WEIRD\nINQUIRY YOU'VE NOW FOUND YOURSELF IN?\n>> YEAH.

THERE'S A LOT OF WAYS TO CLEAR\nTHIS UP. WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN ANY OF THEM\nYET. THIS IS SOMEONE WHO -- SAY THESE\nWERE $10 BILLION. YOU FOUND SO FAR A $10,000\nDONATION OUT OF HIS OWN POCKET OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS.\nTHEY COULD JUST TELL YOU WHO HE'S GIVEN MONEY TO, RIGHT?\n>> THEY COULD.

WHAT IS VERY IMPORTANT HERE IS\nTHIS IS ALL PREMISED ON \"THE WASHINGTON POST\" STORY WHICH WAS\nORIGINALLY WRITTEN, AND THAT \"WASHINGTON POST\" STORY\nSPECIFICALLY OUTLINED THREE FOUNDATIONS THAT CLAIMED DONALD\nTRUMP MADE A CONTRIBUTION TO AND THOSE FOUNDATIONS SAID THEY\nDIDN'T RECEIVE THE MONEY UNTIL CNN WENT BACK AND DID RESEARCH\nAND FOUND THEY ACTUALLY RECEIVED THE MONEY ON EACH OF THOSE\nOCCASIONS, AND \"THE WASHINGTON POST\" SAYS WE STAND BY OUR\nSTORY. NOW YOU HAVE SCHNEIDERMAN WHO\nSOLICITED CONTRIBUTIONS FROM DONALD TRUMP AND IVANKA AND HIS\nSON-IN-LAW TO HELP HIS CAMPAIGN IN THE FUTURE NOW USING HIS \u00e2\u0096\nOFFICE FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES TO GO AFTER A FOUNDATION.\n>> THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS ACTUALLY HARSHER, IT SAYS THE\nATTORNEY GENERAL IS A PART SAN WHO HAS TURNED A BLIND EYE TO\nTHE CLINTON FOUNDATION FOR YEARS AND ENDORSED HILLARY CLINTON FOR\nPRESIDENT. THIS IS NOTHING MORE THAN\nANOTHER LEFT WING HIT JOB DESIGNED TO DISTRACT FROM\nCROOKED HILLARY CLINTON'S DISASTROUS WEEK.\nWHY ARE YOU NOT SURPRISED THEY'RE OPENING AN INVESTIGATION\nINTO THE TRUMP FOUNDATION? >> WELL, THERE HAVE BEEN THREE\nKNOWN ILLEGAL ACTS BY THE TRUMP PERSONAL, HE GIVES PERSONAL\nDONATIONS. WHAT WE SAW THIS YEAR ALONE IS\nWHEN DONALD TRUMP RAISED $6 MILLION FOR THE VETERANS HE\nWROTE A PERSONAL ONE MR$1 MILLI ACCOUNT TO THE MARINE CORPS\nFOUNDATION, AND HE WILL AGREE THAT HAS BEEN RECEIVED.\nWE KNOW DONALD TRUMP HAS NOT DONATED TO HIS CHARITY SINCE\n2008 BECAUSE HE HAS CHOSEN TO GIVE THE MONEY PERSONALLY, TENS\nOF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. >> UNLESS HIS RETURNS ARE\nRELEASED YOU DON'T SEE THAT. THIS IS A YEAR HE IS RUNNING FOR\nPRESIDENT SO HE'S GOING TO MAKE A BIG DEAL THAT HE HAS GIVEN TO\nCHARITY. THERE IS NO PROOF.\n>> HE SAID HE WILL RELEASE HIS TAXES AS SOON AS THE AUDIT IS\nCOMPLETED BUT WE KNOW HE HAS GIVEN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS\nPERSONALLY, AND WE KNOW THAT \"THE WASHINGTON POST\" STORY\nWHICH SAYS HE DIDN'T GIVE TO THE --\n>> YOU MADE YOUR POINT, BUT LET'S SAY THIS.\nWE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING TRANSPARENCY AND WE TALKED ABOUT\nIT LAST NIGHT, ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF WHAT HAPPENED THIS\nWEEKEND WITH SECRETARY CLINTON.

IT IS COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT.\n>> NOT REALLY. >> YOU KNOW WHAT WE LEARNED FROM\nMIKE PENCE'S TAXES, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.\n>> HE RELEASED THEM. >> HE RELEASED TEN YEARS OF\nTAXES. >> HE RELEASED THEM BECAUSE\nTHERE'S NOTHING IN THERE. THE QUESTION IS --\n>> AND I RESPECT MIKE PENCE. >> BUT PEOPLE ARE SAYING DONALD\nTRUMP IS NOT RELEASING TAX RETURNS EVEN THOUGH THE IRS AND\nATTORNEYS SAID IF THERE'S NOTHING HE CAN RELEASE THEM.\nTHAT'S BULL TO SAY THAT, THAT'S A TALKING POINT TO SAY HE CAN'T.\n>> HIS ACCOUNTANT AND ATTORNEYS HAVE SAID OUR BEST ADVICE TO YOU\nIS AS YOU ARE UNDER AUDIT FROM THE IRS YOU SHOULD NOT RELEASE\nYOUR TAX RETURNS.

THE TRUMP FOUNDATION REPORTED\nTHAT THEY HAD GIVEN TO FRIENDS OF VETERANS IN VERMONT.\nWELL, THE FOLKS IN VERMONT DIDN'T GET $1,000, BUT THE\nFRIENDS OF VETERANS IN PALM BEACH IN FLORIDA DID.\nSO ON THOSE THREE DIFFERENT CASES IT SEEMS THAT TRUMP MAY\nHAVE A POINT, THAT THERE'S SOME INACCURACIES IN THE REPORTING.\nBUT AS I SAID, OVERALL, WE'RE LOOKING FOR TENS OF MILLIONS OF\nDOLLARS AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT COLLECTIVELY $21,000 HERE.\n>> I WANT TO BRING IN DAVID FAHRENTHOLD FROM \"THE WASHINGTON\nPOST\" WHO, AS DREW POINTED OUT, HAS DONE EXHAUSTIVE RESEARCH ON\nTRUMP'S FOUNDATION.

I TALKED TO 326 CHARITIES THAT\nLOOKED TO BE SORT OF THE CLOSEST TO TRUMP.\nAND IN THE PERIOD BETWEEN 2008 AND THIS MAY, I FOUND ONE GIFT\nFROM BACK IN 2009 THAT WAS GIVEN OUTSIDE THE FOUNDATION.\nSO AS FAR AS I CAN TELL, THE TRUMP FOUNDATION SUCH AS IT IS\nIS THE PUBLIC EVIDENCE OF TRUMP'S CHARITY IN THE LAST FEW\nYEARS. >> KELLYANNE CONWAY STATED THAT\nDONALD TRUMP HAS DONATED TO CHARITIES WITH HIS OWN, QUOTE,\nOWN MONEY AND HIS FOUNDATIONING MONEY, WHICH IS HIS MONEY, END\nQUOTE.

I ALSO WANT TO FIND THE\nLOCATIONS OF A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT TRUMP SEEMS TO HAVE BOUGHT\nFOR HIMSELF WITH MONEY FROM THE TRUMP FOUNDATION.\n>> LIKE A SIX-FOOT-TALL PAINTING OF HIMSELF?\n>> A 6-FOOT-TALL PAINTING OF HIMSELF HE BOUGHT IN 2007, WITH\n$20,000 FROM THE TRUMP FOUNDATION.\nSO THAT'S ONE THING. I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT WHERE\nTHAT IS. HE'S SUPPOSED TO HAVE KEPT IT OR\nUSED IT FOR CHARITABLE PURPOSES. HE CAN'T JUST USE IT TO DECORATE\nA GOLF CLUB. WE HAVEN'T FOUND THAT.\nTHERE'S ALSO A TIM TEBOW HELMET HE BOUGHT IN 2012 WITH MONEY\nFROM THE FOUNDATION. >> AND DAVID, AS COMPARED TO\nOTHER, YOU KNOW, FOUNDATIONS FOUNDED BY VERY WEALTHY PEOPLE,\nTHINK ABOUT GATES OBVIOUSLY, OPRAH WINFREY HAS A FOUNDATION.\nHER FOUNDATION HAS SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN\nIT, I BELIEVE, AND HER NET WORTH IS SUPPOSED TO BE LESS THAN\nDONALD TRUMP'S, RIGHT? >> \"FORBES\" SAYS HER NET WORTH\nIS 3 BILLION VERSUS 4.5 BILLION FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nAND SHE SAID AS YOU SAID MORE THAN $100 MILLION IN HER\nFOUNDATION.

TRUMP\nIN AUGUST 2013 BECAUSE, AS SET FORTH IN GREAT DETAIL IN THE\nPAPERS WE FILED WITH THE COURT, HE -- TRUMP UNIVERSITY WAS A\nSCHEME TO FLEECE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ALL OVER AMERICA OUT OF\nMILLIONS OF DOLLARS, INCLUDING A LOT OF PEOPLE IN FLORIDA.\nI AM THE ONLY STATE ACTOR SO FAR TO SUE TRUMP UNIVERSITY.\nSO ATTORNEY GENERAL BONDI IS NOT ALONE.\nBUT WE -- MY INTEREST IN THE -- THIS ISSUE REALLY IS IN MY\nCAPACITY AS REGULATOR OF NON-PROFITS IN NEW YORK STATE.\nWE'VE BEEN CONCERNED THAT THE TRUMP FOUNDATION HAS ENGAGED IN\nIMPROPRIETY IN THAT WAY. WE'VE BEEN LOOKING INTO THE\nTRUMP FOUNDATION TO MAKE SURE IT'S COMPLYING WITH THE LAWS\nGOVERNING CHARITIES IN NEW YORK. >> WERE YOU SURPRISED WHEN\nFLORIDA DIDN'T JOIN THE LAWSUIT? >> I CAN'T SAY I WAS SURPRISED\nBECAUSE NEITHER HAS ANYBODY ELSE.\nYOU KNOW, THIS IS ONE WHERE MR. TRUMP HAS A CLASS ACTION -- TWO\nCLASS-ACTIONS PENDING AGAINST HIM, PRIVATE PARTIES REPRESENTED\nBY CLASS-ACTION ATTORNEYS IN CALIFORNIA, BUT THE ONLY LAW\nENFORCEMENT OFFICER TO PURSUE HIM IS ME.\nIT WAS PURPORTED TO BE A NEW YORK UNIVERSITY, AND WE DO HAVE\nPRETTY STRICT RULES ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO TO BE A\nUNIVERSITY IN NEW YORK STATE.

THEY ALL JOIN ME HERE IN THE\nSTUDIO. IT IS A PLEASURE HAVING YOU ALL\nON. HILLARY CLINTON IS OFF THE\nCAMPAIGN TRAIL, BARAK OBAMA STEPPING IN TODAY.\nTHE PRESIDENT STEPPING IN TODAY TO HELP HER IN THE KEY\nBATTLEGROUND STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA.\nMARK, I AM COMING TO YOU BUT I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO A BIT OF\nWHAT THE PRESIDENT HAD TO SAY. >> SO YOU WANT DEBATE\nTRANSPARENCY, YOU'VE GOT ONE CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE WHO HAS\nRELEASED DECADES WORTH OF HER TAX RETURNS.\nTHE OTHER CANDIDATE IS THE FIRST IN DECADES WHO REFUSES TO\nRELEASE ANY AT ALL. YOU WANT TO DEBATE FOUNDATIONS\nAND CHARITIES? ONE CANDIDATE'S FAMILY\nFOUNDATION HAS SAVED COUNTLESS LIVES AROUND THE WORLD.\nTHE OTHER CANDIDATE'S FOUNDATION TOOK MONEY OTHER PEOPLE GAVE TO\nHIS CHARITY AND THEN BOUGHT A SIX-FOOT TALL PAINTING OF\nHIMSELF. >> I THINK YOU WILL AGREE AS\nOTHERS, EVEN ON THE OTHER SIDE THAT SAY THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA IS\nA GIFTED CAMPAIGNER, BUT HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK THIS IS GOING\nTO IMPACT HER CAMPAIGN? IS IT GOING TO HELP HER?\n>> QUITE A BIT. LOOK, HE IS ONE OF THE MOST\nGIFTED POLITICIANS OF OUR TIME. NOW, LET'S GO BACK AND WHO WAS\nTHAT PERSON BEFORE BARAK OBAMA? WAS BILL CLINTON, RIGHT?\nSOMEBODY WHO COULD DELIVER A SPEECH, BE SERIOUS YET\nINTERTWINE AND WEAVE IN PARABLES AND STORIES AND ALSO TAKE SUBTLE\nJABS. >> I WAS WALKING NIMA HENDERSON\nWATCHING THE PRESIDENT SAYING THAT BARAK OBAMA IS NOW HILLARY\nCLINTON'S BILL CLINTON. >> AND KNEEA IS RIGHT.\nHERE IS THE THING ABOUT BARAK OBAMA, HE WILL NOT BE ON THE\nCAMPAIGN TRAIL THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS.\nHE IS STILL PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, BUT COME OCTOBER\nHE WILL BE ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, OUT THERE FOR HER, IN\nSTATES SUCH AS NORTH CAROLINA AND FLORIDA, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE\nDON'T REALIZE THERE ARE AFRICAN-AMERICAN AMERICANS IN\nKEY STATES SUCH AS OHIO, MICHIGAN AND IN PENNSYLVANIA.\nWE SAW HIM IN PHILADELPHIA TODAY.\nBARAK OBAMA COULD BE A GREAT HELP.\nSOMEONE SAID THIS EARLIER AND THEY'RE RIGHT, WHEN IS THE LAST\nTIME WE HAVE SEEN A SITTING PRESIDENT CAMPAIGN SO HARD ON\nBEHALF OF THEIR NOMINEE? >> SMART MOVE TO HAVE HIM OUT\nTHERE? >> UNQUESTIONABLY.\nTHE GUY IS POPULAR, WHICH IS NOT ALWAYS COMMON FOR BARAK OBAMA\nMUCH LESS PRESIDENTS. YOU KNOW, THE NEW POST ABC POLL\nHAD 58% APPROVAL WHICH I THINK IS A LITTLE HIGH, BUT EVERYBODY\nELSE HAS 50%. HE IS WELL LIKED, A GOOD\nCAMPAIGNER. WE SAW CHICK DATA THAT SHOWED\nINCOMES ROSE BY 2% ACROSS THE COUNTRY.\nTHERE'S GOOD NEWS BEHIND BARAK OBAMA AND BARAK OBAMA IS A GOOD\nADVOCATE. THERE'S A STRONG CORRELATION\nBETWEEN HAVING A. LAR PRESIDENT AND THE PARTY\nDOING WELL IN A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.\nIT IS WIN, WIN, WIN. >> WATCHING AND LISTENING TO HIM\nTODAY I WAS THINKING THIS MAN IS GOING TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO\nGET HILLARY CLINTON ELECT BECAUSE IT IS PERSONAL FOR HIM,\nAND NOT ONLY THAT IT IS LEGACY AS WELL.\n>> IT IS ABSOLUTE LEGACY. GOING TO YOUR POINT ABOUT THE\nECONOMIC DATA, YOU CAN LOOK AND SAY WE HAVE JUST HAD THE BIGGEST\nJUMP IN MEDIAN INCOMES IN THIS COUNTRY IN 50 YEARS.\nTHAT'S A NICE PIECE OF ECONOMIC DATA TO GO OUT WITH.\n>> DOES IT HELP OR HURT -- FOR LEGACY, BUT DOES IT HELP OR HURT\nIN THIS CAMPAIGN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC DATA AND PEOPLE\nSAY, WELL, I DON'T FEEL IT? >> WELL, YOU KNOW, IT IS\nINTERESTING BECAUSE THIS LAST BIT OF DATA SHOWS THAT INCOMES\nARE FINALLY STARTING TO RISE AT THE BOTTOM AND AT THE MIDDLE.\nSO YOU'RE FINALLY STARTING TO GET A LITTLE BIT OF THAT, YOU\nKNOW, GAP STARTING TO SHRINK. I THINK PEOPLE THIS YEAR DID\nSTART TO FEEL A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN THEY HAVE CERTAINLY IN THE\nPAST SIX OR SEVEN YEARS. I THINK WE ARE AT A TURNING\nPOINT. >> AND IT WOULD BE INTERESTING\nFOR HIM TO HAVE DONALD TRUMP BE THE RECIPIENT OF THAT IF THIS\nCONTINUES TO GO IN THAT DIRECTION INSTEAD OF HILLARY\nCLINTON, WHICH WOULD HELP HIS LEGACY.\nSO IT MEANS EVEN MORE TO HIM. >> THAT'S RIGHT.\n>> PHILIP BUMP, IVANKA TRUMP WAS ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL WITH HER\nDAD TONIGHT AND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT PROMOTING MIDDLE\nCLASS FAMILIES, HOW TO HELP MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES,\nESPECIALLY TO PAY FOR CHILD CARE.\nLISTEN TO THIS. >> THE UNITED STATES IS THE ONLY\nINDUSTRIALIZED NATION IN THE WORLD THAT DOES NOT PROVIDE NEW\nMOTHERS WITH PAID MATERNITY LEAVE.\nMY FATHER'S POLICY WILL GIVE PAID LEAVE TO MOTHER'S WHOSE\nEMPLOYERS ARE AMONG THE 90% OF BUSINESSES WHO DO NOT OFFER THIS\nBENEFIT. >> THIS IS STRAIGHT POLITICS.\nHE NEEDS WOMEN, HE IS GOING AFTER THEM.\n>> HE HAS IVANKA OUT THERE WHO IS A GREAT REPRESENTATIVE,\nFAIRLY WELL LIKED, ESPECIALLY BY STANDARDS OF THIS EE LK SHON\nCYCLE. IT IS ONE OF FIST TIMES WE SAW\nDONALD TRUMP LAYOUT A CONCRETE POLICY PROPOSAL WITH DETAILS.\nHE HASN'T DONE IT AT ALL. HE OF COURSE SAID HILLARY\nCLINTON HASN'T RELEASED A CHILD CARE PLAN, WHICH SHE HAD, WHICH\nIS TRUMPY, BUT IT IS A UNIQUE THING FOR HIM AND HIS CANDIDACY.\nOBVIOUSLY WE COULD TALK ABOUT THE POLICY ITSELF, AND I'M SURE\nTHEY WILL, BUT THEY ARE DETAILED AND NUANCED.\nIT IS UNUSUAL. >>S HE SAID IT IS VERY TRUMPY, I\nLIKE THAT EXPRESSION. ISN'T THE IRONONY ABOUT THE\nDETAILS IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE HER POLICY, IT WAS HER DRIVING FORCE\nBEHIND HER FATHER TO PUT THIS POLICY INTO PLACE?\n>> YES. >> AND TO MAKE SURE THE BUILDING\nBLOCKS WERE THERE. >> AND IT IS IN LINE WITH A LOT\nOF OTHER POLICIES. IT DOES FAVOR MIDDLE CLASS AND\nUPPER MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE. IT IS NOT A POLICY THAT'S GOING\nTO HELP -- >> HOW SO?\n>> IT IS REGRESSIVE, BUT MOST BENEFITS FROM THE KIND OF PLAN\nTHAT THEY'RE PROPOSING WOULD FLOW TO THE PEOPLE WITH THE MOST\nINCOME. SO IT IS NOT REALLY GOING TO\nHELP WORKING CLASS AMERICANS, MIDDLE CLASS AMERICANS, LOWER\nMIDDLE CLASS AMERICANS WHO REALLY DO NEED CHILD CARE THE\nMOST. >> WHAT DO WE KNOW, MARK, IF\nANYTHING ABOUT HOW HE HANDLED THESE SIMILAR ISSUES IN HIS OWN\nCOMPANIES, PAID FAMILY LEAVE, CHILD CARE, THAT SORT OF THING?\n>> WELL, THEY PUT A STATEMENT OUT TODAY AND THEY SAID THE\nTRUMP CORPORATION, THAT THEY FEEL VERY GOOD ABOUT THE\nPOLICIES THAT THEY HAVE DONE. LOOK AT, I'M NOT A LABOR EXPERT\nSO, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT ONE TO SPEAK OF THAT.\nI DO THINK IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT, AND LET'S ASSUME\nTHERE ARE HOLES IN IT. IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO\nBE TALKING ABOUT THIS WITHOUT THEM HAVING SOME BUTTONED UP\nAPPROACH FOR THEIR OWN COMPANY. >> THE QUESTION IS ALWAYS, RON,\nHOW ARE GUG TO PAY FOR THIS. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE RUNNING FOR\nPRESIDENT PROPOSE, HOW IS HE GOING TO PAY FOR THIS?\n>> THAT'S WHAT WE HAVEN'T HEARD ENOUGH ABOUT.\nTO YOUR POINT, THIS IS SORT OF CLASSIC TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS,\nA LOT OF THIS STUFF, TAX CUTS, TAX BREAKS, WITHOUT PLANS ABOUT\nHOW TO PAY FOR THEM. AND A LOT OF ECONOMISTS THINK\nTHAT SPENDING AND THE DEFICIT WOULD GO WAY UP BASED ON WHAT\nLITTLE WE'VE SEEN SO FAR OF SOME OF THE TRUMP --\n>> IS IT AN ISSUE THAT CONSERVATIVES AND REPUBLICANS\nTAKE ON? HOW IS THIS GOING TO BE\nRECEIVED? >> I WAS LOOKING AT A TWEET\nBEFORE I CAME OUT HERE, AT BRIGHT BART.COM WHICH HAS BEEN\nSTRONGLY PRO TRUMP HAD A STORY IN 2015 LAMENTING BARAK OBAMA\nWAS PROPOSING PAID CHILD LEAVE. AND THEN THEY HAD AN ARTICLE\nSAYING HOW GREAT IT WAS. IT IS NOT TYPICAL --\n>> ARE YOU SURPRISED? >> NO COMMENT ON THAT.\nIT IS NOT TYPICAL. IT IS AN AREA WHERE BOTH IVANKA\nGOT HER FATHER TO MAKE A CHANGE, BUT ALSO AN AREA WHERE HE CAN BE\nSORT OF A DIFFERENT TYPE OF CANDIDATE BECAUSE HE'S NOT\nBEHOLD ENTO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, TO THE TRADITIONAL\nREPUBLICAN POLITICS. HAD HE BEEN DOING STUFF LIKE\nTHIS ALL ALONG HE WOULD BE IN A SLIGHTLY BETTER POSITION.\n>> LET'S TALK MORE ABOUT THE ECONOMY.\nHERE'S THE PRESIDENT. >> LET'S FACE IT, REPUBLICANS\nDON'T LIKE TO HEAR GOOD NEWS RIGHT NOW, BUT IT IS IMPORTANT\nJUST TO UNDERSTAND THIS IS A BIG DEAL.\nMORE AMERICANS ARE WORKING. MORE HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE.\nINCOMES ARE RISING. POVERTY IS FALLING.\nAND GAS IS $2 A GALLON. THANK YOU FOR REMINDING ME.\nTHANKS, OBAMA. >> HE WAS SAYING THANKS, OBAMA\nBECAUSE EARLIER ON THEY WERE SAYING, THANK YOU, OBAMA, WHAT\nHAVE YOU DURING THIS PIECE. THEY WERE CHANTING THAT.\nYOU KNOW, DONALD TRUMP HAS SAID THE ECONOMY IS A MESS, AND HE\nDID SAY -- HE SAID THAT ECONOMIC STATISTICS ARE RIGGED, HE\nACCUSED FEDERAL RESERVE JANET YELLEN OF KEEPING INTEREST RATES\nLOW TO HELP OBAMA. HOW IS ALL OF THIS INCOME AND\nALL OF THAT, HOW IS IT GOING TO PLAY OUT IN PUBLIC?\nBECAUSE IT IS ACTUALLY GOOD NEWS.\n>> EXACTLY. WHAT IS KIND OF IRONIC IS IF YOU\nLOOK AT REALLY WHO HAS DONE THE MOST FOR THE ECONOMY IN THE LAST\nEIGHT YEARS, IT'S BEEN THE FED. IT IS FUNNY TRUMP WAS TAKING ON\nJANET YELLEN BECAUSE IF ANYBODY HAS DONE ANYTHING FOR THE\nECONOMY, FED KEPT RATES LOW. THE FACT WE HAVE LOW INFLATION\nIS ONE OF THE REASONS MEDIAN INCOMES HAVE BEEN RISING.\nI THINK IT IS HARD TO SAY THIS NEWS IS NOT GOOD NEWS.\nTHAT SAID THERE ARE SOME NUANCES.\nTHE DATA IS BETTER BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE JOBS OUT THERE, BUT\nWAGES AS A WHOLE ARE REALLY NOT GROWING AS FAST AS THEY SHOULD\nAT THIS STAGE IN A RECOVERY. THAT'S BEEN TRUE FOR THE LAST\nFEW REKOEFRS, EACH ONE HAS TAKEN LONGER AND BEEN WEAKER THAN THE\nLAST. >> THANK YOU ALL.\nI APPRECIATE IT. WHEN WE COME BACK NEW YORK\nATTORNEY'S GENERAL SAYS HE IS INVESTIGATING THE TRUMP\nFOUNDATION. THE CAMPAIGN CALLS IT A LEFT\nWING HIT JOB. WE HAVE THE STORY COMING UP.",

FOR ANYBODY WHO HAS WON THE\nPRESIDENCY TWICE AS HE HAS, TAKES ENORMOUS TALENT.\nSEEN WHAT TALENT HE HAS AS CAMPAIGNER AND GOVERNING LEADER.\nAS WE COME TO THE END OF HIS SECOND TERM WE SEE HOW MUCH HE\nHAS TO BE PROUD OF AND SEE THE POLICIES THAT HE'S INSTITUTED\nARE REALLY WORKING. THAT'S PROBABLY THE BEST SELLING\nPOINT TO HILLARY CLINTON. >> QUESTION IS HOW TRANSFERRABLE\nIS HIS POPULARITY. AND WE DON'T REALLY KNOW THE\nANSWER TO THAT. WHAT HE CAN DO IS START GETTING\nPEOPLE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON WHICH HAS BEEN A\nREAL PROBLEM FOR HER AMONG DEMOCRAT.\n>> POINT HOW THE HOW HIS MESSAGE IS OUT OF TOUCH WITH HOW PEOPLE\nFEEL.

CNN SENIOR POLITICAL REPORTER\nNIA-MALIKA HENDERSON. CRISCO ADVANTAGE WHO SUPPORTS\nDONALD TRUMP. HILARY ROSEN A, A DEMOCRATIC\nSTRATEGIST WHO SUPPORTS HILLARY CLINTON AND WITH ME HERE ON SET\nWHO COVERED OBAMA THE LAST COUPLE OF ROUNDS JEFF ZELENY.\nSUSAN PAGE, I DEFER TO YOU AS YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH AS WE\nMENTIONED, WHAT, NINE ELECTIONS AND LISTENING TO PRESIDENT ON\nHIS TALK OF TRANSPARENCY, OF A DOUBLE STANDARD, WHAT JUMPED OUT\nAT YOU? >> I'VE COVERED NINE, THIS IS MY\nTENTH. NEVER IN THOSE CAMPAIGNS HAVE\nYOU HAD AN INCUMBENT PRESIDENT CAMPAIGN WITH THAT KIND OF\nENTHUSIASM FOR HIS PARTY'S NOMINEE TO SUCCEED.\nFOR VARIOUS REASONS AL GORE DIDN'T WANT BILL CLINTON OUT\nTHERE. JOHN McCAIN DID NOT WANT GEORGE\nW. BUSH OUT THERE. THIS IS A CASE WHERE BARACK\nOBAMA ALIGNS WITH HILLARY CLINTON'S POSITION.\nHE WANTS YOUNGER VOTERS AND AFRICAN-AMERICANS TO TURN OUT IN\nSIGNIFICANT NUMBERS. YOU SAW HIS POWER TO DO THAT IN\nTHAT RALLY WE JUST WATCHED IN PHILADELPHIA.\n>> NIA, WHAT DID YOU ANY WHY IS HE IN PHILADELPHIA, TOO?\n>> PHILADELPHIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN GOOD TO DEMOCRATS.\nYOU THINK ABOUT 2008, BARACK OBAMA DREW 35,000 FOLKS THERE IN\n2004 JOHN KERRY WAS THERE WITH BILL CLINTON, DREW A CROWD OF\nLIKE 100,000. IT'S THE CENTER OF THAT\nPENNSYLVANIA GETOUT-THE-VOTE MACHINE FOR DEMOCRATS AND\nDEMOCRATS NEED TO WIN PENNSYLVANIA THIS GO ROUND IF\nTHEY'RE TO CONTINUE OBAMA'S LEGACY AND HAVE HILLARY CLINTON\nTAKE THE WHITE HOUSE. HE WAS FEELING IT OUT THERE.\nTHIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO HAS A 58% APPROVAL RATING ACCORDING TO\nTHIS \"WASHINGTON POST\" POLL THAT CAME OUT JUST RECENTLY.\nAND I THOUGHT HE VERY EFFECTIVELY PICKED APART SOME OF\nDONALD TRUMP'S ARGUMENTS. HE WAS MOCKING HIM.\nHE TALKED ABOUT THE BIZARRENESS, HE FRAMED IT THAT WAY, OF DONALD\nTRUMP SEEING PUTIN AS A ROLE MODEL.\nHE TALKED ABOUT THIS IDEA OF DONALD TRUMP BEING A CHAMPION OF\nWORKING CLASS. AMERICANS, BUT YET SOMEONE WHO\nWOULDN'T LET WORKING CLASS AMERICANS IN HIS BUILDINGS OR\nSOMEONE WHO WOULDN'T LET WORKING CLASS AMERICANS ON TO HIS GOLF\nCOURSES. I THOUGHT HE WAS SO EFFECTIVE\nHERE IN THIS CROWD TODAY AND I AM SURE THE HILLARY CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN IS PLEASED AND WANTS TO SEE HIM OUT THERE MORE AND MORE\nAND IN OCTOBER HE WILL BE OUT THERE MUCH MORE.\n>> HIS LINE -- HE WAS SORT OF ON A ROLL GETTING THE CROWD TO\nLAUGH, TALKING ABOUT -- WHEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT VLADIMIR PUTIN\nAS A ROLE MODEL AND TALKING ABOUT SADDAM HUSSEIN AND SAYING,\nLISTEN, IF YOU JAIL DISSIDENTS AND YOU CONTROL THE MEDIA, YOU'D\nHAVE A 90% APPROVAL RATING, TOO. CHRIS KOVAC, TO YOU.\nWE HEARD ABOUT THIS TRANSPARENCY WHEN HILLARY CLINTON WAS ON THE\nPHONE WITH ANDERSON COOPER, WE HEARD IT WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA,\nTHIS LACK OF TRANSPARENCY WHEN IT COMES TO YOUR CANDIDATE.\nDO YOU AGREE WITH THAT? WE JUST DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP. >> WELL, I MEAN, I THINK THAT'S\nA HARD CHARGE FOR THE HILLARY CAMPAIGN AND BY EXTENSION\nPRESIDENT OBAMA TO MAKE, TOO, BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL OF THE\nDESTROYED E-MAILS ON HILLARY'S PART AND THE LACK OF\nTRANSPARENCY -- >> TAX RETURNS, MEDICAL RECORDS,\nTWO EXAMPLES THEY WOULD THROW BACK AT YOU.\n>> RIGHT, BUT I'M SAYING -- RIGHT, EXACTLY.\nTHERE'S NO QUESTION TRUMP HAS SAID YOU WILL SEE THE TAX\nRETURNS AFTER THE AUDIT IS DONE. I'M SURE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WILL\nBE HAPPY TO PUT OUT MEDICAL RECORDS IN LIGHT OF THE RECENT\nDIFFICULTIES WITH .\nI DON'T THINK THERE WILL BE A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY THERE.\nI'LL SAY THIS ABOUT OBAMA -- >> HANG ON.\nWHEN YOU BRING UP THE MEDICAL RECORDS.\nDO WE KNOW HOW FAR BACK, HOW DETAILED THE TRUMP MEDICAL\nRECORDS WILL BE WHEN THEY'RE RELEASED THIS WEEK?\n>> I DON'T KNOW HOW FAR. I HAVEN'T GOTTEN ANY INFORMATION\nON THAT. BUT I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IN\nTHEY'RE PRETTY SIGNIFICANT. LET ME SAY THIS.\nI THINK HAVING OBAMA SPEAK ON BEHALF OF HILLARY WAS A SMART\nMOVE BECAUSE ONE OF THE MAIN PROBLEMS WE'VE SEEN IN THIS\nENTIRE CAMPAIGN YEAR FOR THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS AN\nENTHUSIASM GAP. REMEMBER IN THE REPUBLICAN\nPRIMARIES TRUMP BROUGHT ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE OUT OF THE\nWOODWORK AND HAD HUGE RECORD-SETTING NUMBERS.\nON THE DEMOCRAT SIDE YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT.\nSO OBAMA HAS THE ABILITY TO MOTIVATE PEOPLE AND GET THEM\nEXCITED FOR HILLARY, THE BASE, THAT IS, PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY\nTHINKING ABOUT VOTING FOR HILLARY BUT IT'S A DOUBLE-EDGED\nSWORTD BECAUSE IT REINFORCES HILLARY WILL BE A THIRD OBAMA\nTERM AND I DON'T THINK THEY'RE RUNNING AWAY FROM THAT ANYMORE\nIN THE HILLARY CAMPAIGN AND THAT PLAYS INTO TRUMP'S ARGUMENT\nTHAT, LOOK, I CAN BLAME THE WAGE STAGNATION ON HILLARY, I CAN\nBLAME THE POOR ECONOMY, OUR WEAKNESS ABROAD ON HILLARY\nBECAUSE SHE'S EMBRACING THE IDEA THAT SHE WILL BE THE THIRD OBAMA\nTERM. SO IT HAS A NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCE\nFOR THE CAMPAIGN. >> I THINK ON ECONOMICS, HE\nBROUGHT UP THE NEW NUMBERS WITH REGARD TO THE MEDIAN INCOME\nGOING UP TO $56,000. HIS LINE WAS REPUBLICANS DON'T\nLIKE TO HEAR GOOD NEWS RIGHT NOW.\nSO HILARY ROSEN, I WANT YOU TO RESPOND TO THAT BUT I WANT YOU\nTO RESPOND TO OBAMA'S POINT WHEN HE WAS SAYING HILLARY CLINTON IS\nSUBJECTED TO MORE SCRUTINY, MORE CRITICISM, THAT THERE IS A\nDOUBLE STANDARD. >> AND LET'S REMEMBER THAT\nPRESIDENT OBAMA HAS A MAJORITY APPROVAL RATING IN THIS COUNTRY,\nMUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT SO IF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WILL TRY TO HANG\nHIM AROUND HILLARY'S NECK THEY'LL BE SURPRISED BECAUSE\nHE'S QUITE POPULAR, PARTICULARLY IN THE STATES DONALD TRUMP HAS\nTO WIN TO OVERCOME HER LEAD. I THINK WE GET TO THIS POINT NOW\nIN THE RACE WHERE HILLARY CLINTON IS GOING TO BE MORE\nPROACTIVE, MORE POSITIVE ABOUT THE CHANGES SHE'S GOING TO MAKE\nIN THIS COUNTRY AND I THOUGHT PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS VERY\nARTICULATE IN SAYING ESSENTIALLY LOOK AT DONALD TRUMP'S RECORD.\nHE'S CHEATED PEOPLE, HIS FOUNDATION DIDN'T JUST TAKE\nOTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY BUT IT BOUGHT A SIX-FOOT-TALL PAINTING\nOF HIMSELF. THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF GIEP\nWHO'S GOING TO COME UP WITH POLICIES TO HELP YOU, THE\nMIDDLE-CLASS, IN PENNSYLVANIA. >> ON THE ENTHUSIASM POINT,\nTHOUGH, LET ME BOUNCE BACK WHEN KRIS MENTIONED THAT, THAT'S A\nVALID CRITICISM OF HILLARY CLINTON THUS FAR, ESPECIALLY\nAMONG SOME YOUNG FOLKS. JEFF ZELENY, YOU SAW PRESIDENT\nOBAMA, YOU COVERED HIM, YOU WERE SHOWING ME A PICTURE IN '08 AND\nYOU REMEMBER THESE SIMILAR CHORUSES WHICH BROUGHT ABOUT\nENTHUSIASM, ESPECIALLY FROM YOUNG PEOPLE \"YES, WE CAN.\"\n>> WITHOUT A DOUBT. HE'S HOPING THE RESPONSE IS THE\nSAME. YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THERE ARE\nSO MANY MILLENNIALS WHO DIDN'T GET THE CHANCE TO VOTE FOR HIM\nSO HE'S OFFERING THEM A CHANCE TO VOTE FOR THIS THIRD TERM.\nI COULD NOT V IMAGINED SITTING HERE A YEAR OR SO AGO THINKING\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN WOULD HAVE BEEN OKAY RUNNING FOR A THIRD\nOBAMA TERM. AND NOW THEY ARE BECAUSE OF THE\nECONOMIC NUMBERS AND OTHER THINGS AND BECAUSE HE'S SO\nDIFFERENT THAN MR. TRUMP. BUT WHAT'S STRIKING HERE IS\nWE'VE NEVER SEEN IF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S TRANSLATES TO OTHER\nCANDIDATES BEFORE. IT DIDN'T IN 2010 WHEN HE LOST\nCONTROL OF THE SENATE. IT CERTAINLY DIDN'T IF 2014.\nTHIS IS A BIGGEST TEST, I THINK, OF HIS TRANSFERABILITY HERE.\nCAN SOME OF THOSE VOTERS -- WILL THEY FOLLOW HIM AND JOIN HIM?\nHE DOESN'T NEED TO GET EVERYONE, HE JUST NEEDS TO GET THAT OLD\nBAND BACK TOGETHER, THE OBAMA COALITION OF VOTERS.\nTHOO'S WHY HE'S IN PHILLY REGISTERING PEOPLE TO VOTE.\nTHAT'S WHY HE'S HERE AND MICHELLE OBAMA IS IN VIRGINIA ON\nFRIDAY. HE'S THE MOST VALUABLE PLAYER IN\nTHIS CAMPAIGN BUT IT'S A BIG TEST FOR HIM AND HIS LEGACY AS\nWELL. >> JUST ONE QUICK THING ON THE\nENTHUSIASM GAPS WHICH THAT, YOU KNOW, NO ONE, MILLENNIALS OR\nSENIOR CITIZENS, COULD BE WATCHING THIS CAMPAIGN AND JUST\nFEEL GOOD ABOUT IT. THIS IS NOT A CAMPAIGN THAT'S\nTALKING ABOUT DIRECTLY ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY.\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS TO DO EVERYTHING SHE CAN TO MAKE IT BE\nABOUT THAT BUT THIS HAS BEEN FOR THE LAST 15 MONTHS ON THE\nREPUBLICAN SIDE AND WE'VE NOW BROUGHT IT INTO THE GENERAL A\nCAMPAIGN OF INSULTS, OF RACE BAITING, OF RELIGION BAITING.\nIT'S JUST AN UNPLEASANT THING TO EXPERIENCE, I KNOW FOR THOSE OF\nUS SITTING AROUND THAT STUDIO AND SO I CAN ONLY IMAGINE IN SO\nMANY WAYS HOW IT FEELS TO PEOPLE WHO REALLY WANT PROGRESS IN THIS\nCOUNTRY, WHO WANT TO BUILD ON THE PROGRESS OF THIS COUNTRY.\n>> ON PROGRESS, JUST QUICKLY, WE HEARD AND MENTIONED A MOMENT AGO\nHOW OBVIOUSLY PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS TOUTING THE POSITIVE\nECONOMIC NUMBERS TODAY. AS WE WERE LISTENING TO THE\nPRESIDENT, DONALD TRUMP WAS SPEAKING AS WELL.\nHE JUST SPOKE ABOUT THE ECONOMY, LET'S HEAR WHAT HE SAID.\n>> ONE IN FIVE AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS DO NOT HAVE A SINGLE\nHELP IN THE LABOR FORCE. ANOTHER 14 MILLION PEOPLE LEFT\nTHE LABOR FORCE SINCE 2009 AND THE NATIONAL DEBT HAS DOUBLED TO\nNEARLY $20 TRILLION DURING THE OBAMA YEARS.\n>> SO, ALL RIGHT, SUSAN PAGE, COMING TO YOU ON YOUR 10th\nPRESIDENTIAL ELECTION YOU'RE COVERING.\nHERE'S MORE NUMBERS JUST TO CONFUSE EVERYONE BUT IT'S\nSIGNIFICANT. THIS IS THE NEWS THAT CAME OUT\nTODAY. THIS IS FROM THE U.S. CENSUS\nBUREAU. MEDIAN INCOME IN THE U.S. GREW\nTO $56,516, THAT REPRESENTS A 5.2% RAISE FOR AMERICAN WORKERS,\nTHE FIRST GAIN SINCE 2007, ADDITIONALLY THE POVERTY RATE\nALSO DECLINED, ALL OBVIOUSLY POSITIVE NEWS, WE HEARD THE\nPRESIDENT OUT THING  TOUTING TH HE SAID YES IT TOOK TIME FOR\nCHANGE. HOW DO YOU HEAR TRUMP JUXTAPOSED\nWITH THE POSITIVE NEWS TODAY? >> THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT\nSTATISTICS FOR THE DEMOCRATS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE\nUNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS GONE DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY, DOWN BELOW 5%,\nCUT IN HALF DURING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S TENURE BUT THE STAG\nSTATION OF WAGES HAS BEEN A BIG PROBLEM FOR AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS,\nTHIS MEANS MORE AMERICANS CAN FEEL THE ECONOMY IS REALLY IN\nTHAT RECOVERY THAT WE'VE TECHNICALLY BEEN IN FOR SOME\nTIME BUT WHICH A LOT OF PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES AND\nHOUSEHOLDS HAVEN'T FELT. DEFINITELY IMPORTANT STATISTIC.\nBUT YOU SEE TWO DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF AMERICA FROM THESE\nTWO CAMPAIGNS AND WE SAW THAT IN THE TWO CONVENTIONS IN JULY, A\nMUCH MORE UPBEAT VERSION OF WHERE THE COUNTRY IS HEADED\nAMONG CLINTON SUPPORTERS AND DEMOCRATS THAN TRUMP SUPPORTERS.\nWE FOUND IN OUR LATEST POLL THAT ABOUT 6 IN 10 CLINTON SUPPORTERS\nTHINK THE COUNTRY IS HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.\n90% OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS THINK THE NATION IS HEADED IN THE\nWRONG DIRECTION. THIS MAY BE THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL\nDIVIDE BETWEEN THESE TWO CAMPAIGNS.\nKRIS KOBACH, I WANT TO PLAY THIS SOUND.\nTHIS IS FROM TRUMP TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMY, TALKING ABOUT THE\nDIFFERENT PARTIES. THIS IS FROM 2004.\n>> IT JUST SEEMS THAT THE ECONOMY DOES BETTER UNDER THE\nDEMOCRATS THAN THE REPUBLICANS. NOW IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT WAY BUT\nIF YOU GO BACK, IT JUST SEEMS THE ECONOMY DOES BETTER UNDER\nTHE DEMOCRATS BUT WE'VE HAD SOME PRETTY BAD DISASTER UNDER THE\nREPU REPUBLICANS.\n>> IT JUST SEEMS THE ECONOMY DOES BETTER UNDER THE DEMOCRATS.\nTHIS IS SOMETHING THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN GRABBED ON TO WHEN THEY\nTWEETED OUT TODAY, KRIS. >> IT IS INTERESTING.\nIF YOU LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC EBBS AND FLOWS, THE UPS AND DOWNS OF\nGDP, SOMETIMES A DEMOCRAT IS IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND SOMETIMES A\nREPUBLICAN IS BUT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME PERIODS WHEN DEMOCRATS\nHAVE BEEN IN THE WHITE HOUSE BUT I THINK WE HAVE THIS PROBABLY\nFALSE CONCEIT IN AMERICA THAT WHOEVER IS PRESIDENT HAS THE\nABILITY TO JUST BY THEIR OWN WILL SOMEHOW CHANGE THE ECONOMY,\nWE KNOW THAT IT'S A COMBINATION OF WHAT ARE THE TAX POLICIES\nCOMING OUT OF CONGRESS, WHAT IS THE PRESIDENT DOING?\nSO IT'S A VARIETY OF THINGS. >> BUT TRUMP WASN'T SAYING THAT.\nI HEAR YOU ON THE NUANCE AND THE DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATIONS BUT\nTRUMP IS SPEAKING IN A BIT MORE GENERAL TERMS SAYING IT JUST\nSEEMS THE ECONOMY DOES BETTER UNDER THE DEMOCRATS.\nWE'VE HAD SOME PRETTY BAD DISASTERS UNDER THE REPUBLICANS.\nHIS OWN WORDS. >> I THINK HE WAS PROBABLY\nTALKING ABOUT THE WAY I READ IT, WHEN A DEMOCRAT IS SITTING IN\nTHE WHITE HOUSE BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE THE SECOND TERM OF THE\nCLINTON ADMINISTRATION YOU HAD REPUBLICANS BALANCING THE BUDGET\nIN CONGRESS, CLINTON SIGNING THAT BUDGET AND SO YOU HAD SOME\nGOOD YEARS BUT A LOT OF IT HAD TO DO WITH REPUBLICAN FISCAL\nCONSERVATISM. SO IT'S HARD TO GENERALIZE LIKE\nTHAT. BOTTOM LINE IS TRUMP IS -- GO\nAHEAD. >> GO AHEAD, HILLARY.\n>> I WAS GOING TO SAY MUCH OF IT HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT\nWHEN THE REPUBLICANS WERE IN CHARGE THEY DROVE UP THE\nDEFICITS BY CREATING HUGE TAX CUTS ACROSS THE BOARD.\nCREATING A BIG VACUUM IN THE ECONOMY AND ESSENTIALLY CRASHING\nTHE LABOR FORCE. AND SO THAT IS -- AND THEN, YOU\nKNOW, TRUMP STARTED TO MAKE MORE MONEY WHEN DEMOCRATS CAME INTO\nOFFICE. THAT'S WHAT HE'S SAYING AND YET\nWHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO NOW IS TO SUGGEST THAT IS THOSE SAME\nPOLICIES, THOSE SAME ADVISORS, THOSE SAME ACROSS-THE-BOARD TAX\nCUTS ARE SOMEHOW GOING TO CREATE A DIFFERENT SITUATION FOR THE\nMIDDLE-CLASS VOTER, IT'S NOT TRUE.\n>> I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING, PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS QUESTIONING\nHOW DONALD TRUMP WOULD BE CHAMPIONING WORKING CLASS\nPEOPLE, NIA, TO YOU. QUESTIONING THE APPEAL OF\nWORKING AMERICANS TO MR. TRUMP. SEEMED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT.\n>> I THINK THAT WAS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE LINES IN HIS\nSPEECH TODAY, ESSENTIALLY TAKING ONE OF TRUMP'S ARGUMENTS AND HIS\nSELLING POINT THAT HE ALONE CONDITIONED K DO IT AND HE IS\nTHE VOICE FOR SO MANY VOICELESS AND SAYING WELL, WHAT HAVE YOU\nDONE SO STAR IN THAT REGARD AND I THINK DONALD TRUMP AND HIS\nSUPPORTERS WILL SAY LISTEN, HE'S CREATED X NUMBER OF JOBS AS A\nBUSINESSMAN BUT I DO THINK IT'S FAIR TO LOOK AT THOSE BUSINESS\nPRACTICES, TO SEE IF HE'S INVESTED.\nFOR INSTANCE, HE'S GOING TO DETROIT SAYING HE WANTS TO\nINVEST IN THOSE COMMUNITIES, WELL HE HADN'T DONE THAT ALREADY\nAS A BUSINESS PERSON SO I THINK OBAMA'S TONE, THE KIND OF\nMOCKERY AND THE QUESTIONING I THINK IS A SMART ONE AND I THINK\nEVEN THIS AD THAT YOU SEE TODAY WITH DONALD TRUMP SAYING\nDEMOCRATS DO IT BETTER, HE SOUNDS LIKE BILL CLINTON'S\nSPEECH FROM 2012 AND YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT IF YOU'RE A\nDEMOCRAT YOU'LL MAKE THAT INTO AN AD BECAUSE THERE YOU HAVE\nDONALD TRUMP ARGUING THE DEMOCRATIC POLICIES ARE BETTER\nFOR THE ECONOMY. >> FINAL QUESTION, JEFF ZELENY,\nTO YOU. SHE MENTIONED BILL CLINTON IN\nTERMS OF PEOPLE ON THE TRAIL THIS WEEK BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY\nHILLARY CLINTON IS RECOUPING FROM PNEUMONIA, HER HUSBAND WILL\nBE AT FUND-RAISERS IN BEVERLY HILLS, WHO ARE THE BIG NAMES?\n>> THE BIGGEST NAME IS THE ONE WE SAW RIGHT THERE IN\nPENNSYLVANIA BUT TIM KAINE WAS IN MICHIGAN, CHELSEA CLINTON HAS\nTWO STOPS TODAY IN NORTH CAROLINA SO REALLY THE ENTIRE\nDEMOCRATIC BENCH HAS BEEN OUT THERE AND HILLARY CLINTON HAS\nBEEN UP WITH ADS BUT I THINK THE KEY TAKEAWAY HERE, PRESIDENT\nOBAMA I AM TOLD BY HIS ADVISORS IS SO SERIOUS ABOUT THIS, AND WE\nHEARD HIM SAY HE'S LIKE I AM REALLY, REALLY, REALLY INTO\nELECTING HER. HE IS PRETTY MUCH CLEARING HIS\nCALENDAR TO THE EXTENT HE CAN IN OCTOBER TO CAMPAIGN FOR HER AND\nI THINK THAT HE MAKES PROBABLY THE BEST ARGUMENT.\nWE SAW IN 2012 AT THE CONVENTION HOW BILL CLINTON MADE THE\nARGUMENT FOR BARACK OBAMA, MADE THE ECONOMIC CASE FOR THAT.\nBARACK OBAMA IS HILLARY CLINTON'S BILL CLINTON, IF YOU\nWILL.

BECAUSE OF OUTRAGEOUS COMMENTS\nLIKE THOSE OF A CANADIAN FEDERAL COURT JUDGE NOW FACING REMOVAL\nFROM THAT FEDERAL BENCH. HERE'S HOW BAD IT IS --\nIF YOU GOT KIDS IN THE ROOM WITH YOU RIGHT NOW, AND YOUR TV IS ON\nME, YOU NEED TO EITHER TURN ME OFF, WHICH I REALLY HOPE YOU\nDON'T DO, BECAUSE YOU NEED TO HEAR WHAT'S COMING, OR TAKE THE\nNEXT FIVE SECONDS TO GET THOSE KIDS OUT OF THE ROOM.\nNOT KIDDING. UNBEARABLE LANGUAGE.\nREADY? GOOD.\nTHE JUDGE IN A RAPE CASE ASKED THE WOMAN WHO WAS A RAPE VICTIM,\n\" -- I DON'T WANT TO GET THIS WRONG -- \"WHY COULDN'T YOU JUST\nKEEP YOUR KNEES TOGETHER?\" THE JUDGE'S NAME IS ROBIN CAMP.\nHE IS RIGHT NOW IN THE MIDDLE OF A WEEK-LONG JUDICIAL COUNCIL\nHEARING THAT IS GOING TO DETERMINE WHETHER THAT MAN STAYS\nIN THAT ROBE OR STAYS ON THAT BENCH, OR GETS THE BOOT.\nIT ALL STEMS FROM THIS 2014 CASE, THE RAPE VICTIM WAS A\n19-YEAR-OLD WOMAN. SHE HAD BEEN RAPED OVER A\nBATHROOM SINK, SHE SAID, DURING A HOUSE PARTY.\nTHE COURT RECORDS SHOW THAT JUDGE CAMP HAD PLENTY OF ADVICE\nFOR THE ACCUSER, AND THEN FOR THE MAN WHO WAS CHARGED WITH THE\nCRIME AS WELL. SO LET'S START WITH THE ADVICE\nHE HAD FOR THE WOMAN IN HIS COURTROOM.\nWHY DIDN'T SHE \"JUST SKEW HER PELVIS OR PUSH HER BOTTOM TO THE\nSINK TO AVOID PENETRATION?\" AND THEN HIS ADVICE FOR THE MAN\nIN THE COURTROOM, AFTER HE ACQUITTED HIM, \"I WANT YOU TO\nTELL YOUR FRIENDS, YOUR MALE FRIENDS, THAT IS, THAT THEY HAVE\nTO BE FAR MORE GENTLE WITH WOMEN.\nTHEY HAVE TO BE FAR MORE PATIENT, AND THEY HAVE TO BE\nVERY CAREFUL TO PROTECT THEMSELVES.\"\n\"THEY HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL.\" AND THEN LISTEN TO THESE\nCOMMENTS IN GENERAL. JUST FOR THE REST OF US.\n\"YOUNG WOMEN WANT TO HAVE SEX, PARTICULARLY IF THEY'RE DRUNK.\nSOME SEX AND PAIN, SOMETIMES GO TOGETHER, AND THAT'S NOT\nNECESSARILY A BAD THING.\" I DON'T KNOW OFF THE TOP OF YOUR\nHEAD, IF IT'S POPPED OFF, BUT MINE DID, THE FIRST TIME I SAW\nTHIS. AND THEN I READ ABOUT THE\nVERDICT. SO THAT VERDICT WAS ACTUALLY\nOVERTURNED ON APPEAL. THIS IS A BRAND NEW TRIAL\nSCHEDULED FOR NOVEMBER ARE AND THE JUDGE HAS SINCE APOLOGIZED.\nAPPARENTLY A COUPLE OF TIMES. HE'S APOLOGIZED.\nTHAT GUY, YOU KNOW, WHO WAS IN HIS COURT THAT WAS ACQUITTED IS\nOUT THERE SOMEWHERE, BUT THE JUDGE APOLOGIZED.\nCNN'S LEGAL ANALYST DANNY SAVALAS AND JOEY JACKSON ARE\nWITH ME NOW AND BLANK FACED BECAUSE I THINK THEY HAD THE\nSAME REACTION I DID. DOES THIS HAPPEN IN AMERICA?\nYES, THAT'S CANADA, AND THIS JUDGE IS ONLY 64.\nNOT A WHOLE LOT OLDER THAN I AM. >> HOW MANY TIMES, JOEY JACKSON,\nHAVE YOU BEEN SITTING IN COURT WATCHING ANOTHER CASE AND TURNED\nTO ANOTHER LAWYER AND SAY, DID YOU JUDGE JUST SAY THAT ON THE\nRECORD? >> MULTIPLE.\n>> I THINK THIS HAPPENING MORE OFTEN THAT YOU THINK.\nTHE REALITY, IT JUST GOES INTO THE EITV ETHER, EVEN IF PRERECO\nIN A PRE-VIRAL SOCIETY DIDN'T MAKE IT INTO THE PUBLIC.\nI THINK IT HAPPENS FAIRLY OFTEN. ALL JUDGES HAVE TO DO IS STICK\nTO THE SCRIPT. RECITE SENTENCING GUIDELINES.\nTHEY ONLY GET IN TROUBLE WHEN THEY GO OFF-SCRIPT AND DO IMPROV\nAND EDITORIALIZING. THERE'S RARELY A REASON FOR THIS\nKIND OF COLLOQUY EVEN ON THE RECORD.\nIT BAFFLES AND YOU'D BE DISAPPOINTED TO FIND IT HAPPENS\nMORE OFTEN THAN YOU THINK. >> WERE YOU SURPRISED HE WAS 64\nAND NOT JUST TO SUGGEST IT SHOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE, BUT\nSOMETIMES IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE?\nHE WASN'T 84, HE WASN'T 94. HE WAS 64?\n>> NO, I WASN'T SURPRISED ABOUT THAT.\nI WAS SURPRISED MORE ABOUT WHAT HE DID IRRESPECTIVE OF HISSAGE\nAND SURPRISED ALSO THAT HE GOT, AFTER THIS, ON TO THE FEDERAL\nBENCH. IF YOU DO THIS IN 2014, BUT THEN\nYOU ARE ESCALATED AND ELEVATED TO THE FEDERAL BENCH THEREAFTER\nWHAT MESSAGE DOES THAT SEND? IN ADDITION TO THAT THE EXCUSE,\nWHEN I WAS AN ATTORNEY I ONLY DID CONTRACTS AND DIDN'T DO\nBANKRUPTCY. WELL, IF YOU RAILROAD\nCOMFORTABLE HANDLING A CRIMINAL CASE OF THIS MAGNITUDE, DON'T DO\nIT. >> CAN I ACTUALLY READ THE QUOTE\nHE GAVE AS HIS EXCUSE FOR THE KIND OF GARBAGE THAT WENT INTO\nTHE COURTROOM AND ACROSS THE AIRWAVES?\n\"MY COLLEAGUES KNEW MY KNOWLEDGE OF CANADIAN LAW WAS VERY\nMINIMAL. IT WAS NON-EXISTENT\" SAID IT\nFRIDAY IN A HEARING. PLEASE REMEMBER I WASN'T IN THIS\nCOUNTRY THROUGH THE '60s, '70s AND '80s, CALLING HIS COMMENTS\nRUDE AND INSULTING BUT EXCUSE, WASN'T IN CANADA IN THE '60s,\n'70s AND '80s. HE'S SOUTH AFRICAN.\n>> THE PROBLEM, THIS DOESN'T GO TO KNOWLEDGE OF LAW.\n>> KNOWLEDGE OF HUMANITY? >> EXACTLY.\nIT ISN'T SOMETHING YOU CAN BLAME ON HAVING A FAILED UNDERSTANDING\nOF APPLYING THE LAW. THIS HAS TO DO WITH YOUR VALUES\nAND BELIEFS CONCERNING MEN AND WOMEN IN RELATIONSHIPS'S I DON'T\nKNOW -- WELL, I DO KNOW THAT EXCUSE IS UNACCEPTABLE.\nWHETHER IT BE CANADA OR NEW YORK, THE QUESTION IS WHAT YOU\nDO ABOUT IT. DANNY, YOU'LL SPEAK ABOUT THE\nJUDICIAL COUNCIL ISSUE, HERE ALSO THERE ARE GOVERNING BODIES\nTO REGULATE CONDUCT LIKE THIS. IT'S A MASSIVE JOB TO BE A\nJUDGE. A GREAT DEAL OF DISCRETION OVER\nPEOPLE'S LIVES, DECISIONS OF VALUE, AND THOSE DECISIONS NEED\nTO BE TRUSTED BY THE PUBLIC AND A SYSTEM PEOPLE BUY INTO.\nWHEN YOU DO THIS, PEOPLE DON'T. >> A COUPLE SECONDS LEFT.\nCANADA IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN THE UNITED STATES.\nYOU DON'T ELECT JUDGES AT ANY LEVEL.\nAND, YES, THE COUNCIL YOU TALKED ABOUT.\nTHE JUDICIAL COUNCIL THAT MAY SLAP HIM IN NEW ONE AND SEND HIM\nFLYING, BUT WHAT ABOUT THE WOMAN AND WHAT ABOUT THE GUY WHO WAS\nACQUITTED? IF HE OFFENDS AT SOME POINT, IS\nTHERE ANY RECOURSE? IS THERE ANY LIABILITY THAT THE\nSYSTEM, THE GOVERNMENT, THE PEOPLE WHO PUT HIM IN PLACE THAT\nHE HIMSELF MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE? BECAUSE OF THE WAY HE, FIRST OF\nALL, DISPENSED WITH THIS CASE AND SECOND OF ALL ADMITTED,\nWELL, I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING.\nI DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW THE LAW? >> AS IN THE UNITED STATES,\nJUDGES IN CANADA ENJOY IMMUNITY FROM THEIR DECISIONS.\nTHEY CAN'T BE SUED LATER ON IF THEY ALLOW A CRIMINAL TO GO FREE\nEARLY, OR ACQUIT THEM, FIND THEM NOT GUILTY.\nSO IT'S NOT LIKELY THAT THIS JUDGE COULD BE CIVILLY LIABLE\nBASED ON THE LAW, BOTH HERE IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN CANADA.\nHE MAY POTENTIALLY BE REMOVED FROM OFFICE UNDER CANADIAN LAW,\nBUT STATISTICALLY EVEN THAT IS UNLIKELY.\nIT'S HAPPENED IN THE LAST 50 YEARS UNDER THE LAW, MY\nUNDERSTANDING, IT'S HAPPENED TWICE.\nTHAT THE CJC, THE CANADIAN JUR ADDITIONAL COUNCIL RECOMMENDED\nFOR REMOVAL. >> WOW.\nJUST MAKES ME WONDER IF HE'D EVER HAD A MALE -- RAPE\nCOMPLAINANT IN HIS CASE, WOULD HE EVER UTTERED THE WORDS, WHY\nCOULDN'T YOU JUST KEEP YOUR KNEES TOGETHER?\n>> HE WOULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING WORSE, ACTUALLY IN THAT\nSITUATION. >> I DON'T KNOW.\nI REALLY DON'T. HONESTLY I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT\nELSE TO SAY. LEAVE IT THERE.\nWE'LL WATCH THE CASE AND FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS TO JUDGE ROBIN\nCAMP. >> AND WHAT HAPPENS DURING THE\nACTUAL RETRIAL, SINCE SHE WAS OVERTURNED AND THIS PERSON HAS\nTO BE IN COURT AGAIN TO FACE REAL JUSTICE.\n>> AND HOPEFULLY THINGS ARE GOING GENTLE WITH HI FRIENDS.\nAPPALLING WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT",

SO WHAT CAN VIEWERS EXPECT WHEN\nTHE SPARKS FLY BETWEEN HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP?\nLET'S BRING IN JAMES FALLOWS A FORMER CHIEF SPEECHWRITER FOR\nFORMER PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER. HE'S ALSO THE AUTHOR OF THIS\nMONTH'S COVER STORY, AND IT IS A LONG ONE, FOR \"THE ATLANTIC\" ON\nTHESE DEBATES. JIM, GREAT TO SEE YOU THIS\nMORNING ON \"NEW DAY.\" THANKS FOR BEING HERE.\n>> MY PLEASURE. IT'S LONG, BUT THOROUGH AND\nINTERESTING, RIGHT? >> IT IS REALLY INTERESTING.\nI WAS WONDERING WHAT WAS WEIGHING MY BAG DOWN LAST NIGHT\nIT WAS SO HEAVY ON MY ARM. IT WAS YOUR ARTICLE WHEN I\nFISHED IT OUT IT'S LIKE FIVE POUNDS.\nBUT, BUT JIM ARE WE OVERSTATING IT TO SAY THAT THIS COULD BE ONE\nOF THE MOST WATCHED TELEVISION EVENTS EVER?\n>> CERTAINLY THE ODDS ARE IN THAT FAVOR.\nREMEMBER THE CONTROVERSY A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO WHEN THE\nSCHEDULE WAS ANNOUNCED BY THE TRUMP TEAM, THEY SAID OH, NO\nTHESE ARE AGAINST NFL GAMES. HISTORICALLY DEBATES HAVE WAY\nOUTDRAWN EVEN THE NFL BY A FACTOR OF ABOUT THREE TO ONE.\nTHE STAKES FOR THIS ONE, THE FIRST TIME WE'LL EVER SEE\nHILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP FACE TO FACE WHERE THEY'RE SO\nDIFFERENT IN THEIR STYLES, THEIR POLITICS, THEIR INTELLECTUAL\nAPPROACH AND EVERYTHING ELSE, I THINK MANY PEOPLE I INTERVIEWED\nSAID THIS PROBABLY WILL EXCEED M.A.S.H. AND THE O.J. CHASE AS\nTHE BIGGEST AUDIENCE WORLDWIDE. >> OH, MY GOSH.\nTHAT IS HUGE. I MEAN PUTTING IT IN THAT\nPERSPECTIVE. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT FROM YOUR\nRESEARCH AND ALL OF THE EXPERTS YOU'VE TALKED TO, THE WAY THAT\nCLINTON CAN WIN THE DEBATE, AND THE WAY THAT TRUMP CAN WIN THE\nDEBATE. LET ME PUT UP A COUPLE OF POINTS\nFOR OUR VIEWERS. IN TERMS OF HOW SHE WINS.\nSHE IS OBVIOUSLY SEEN AS THIS KIND OF TITAN OF DEBATE PROWESS.\nSO THE ODDS ARE, I MEAN CONVENTIONAL WISDOM SAYS THAT\nSHE TROUNCES HIM. BUT NOT SO FAST.\nLET'S LOOK AT WHAT WE THINK WHAT YOU SAY COULD HELP HER GET THE\nADVANTAGE. SHE'S HAD MANY ONE-ON-ONE\nDEBATES IN HER CAREER. TRUMP, OF COURSE, HAS HAD NO\nONE-ON-ONE DEBATES. THE DEPTH OF HER POLICY\nKNOWLEDGE, SHE'S CONSIDERED A WONK SO SHE HAS SPECIFICS ON\nEXECUTING PLANS, HE AVOIDS DETAILS ON PLANS.\nWHAT ELSE DO YOU THINK WE MIGHT SEE ON THAT STAGE IN TERMS OF\nHER ADVANTAGE? >> HER ADVANTAGES ARE, AS YOU\nSAID, THIS IS SOMETHING SHE HAS DONE MANY TIMES BACK WITH BARACK\nOBAMA EIGHT YEARS AGO WHEN SHE RAN FOR THE SENATE IN 2000 WITH\nBERNIE SANDERS, AND THERE'S A VERY PARTICULAR SKILL TO DOING\nTHESE HEAD-TO-HEAD DEBATES WHERE YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED TO FILL\nA COUPLE OF MINUTES ON TALKING ABOUT HOW YOU'RE GOING TO FUND\nTHINGS. YOU KNOW, WHAT YOUR -- THE\nDETAILS OF YOUR FOREIGN POLICY WILL BE.\nIT'S QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE PRIMARY CYCLE AND DONALD TRUMP\nWAS GOING AGAINST, YOU KNOW, EIGHT OR TEN OTHER PEOPLE ON THE\nSTAGE, AND YOU JUST HAD TO GET IN SOME KIND OF ZINGER, AS WHAT\nWE'LL DISCUSS. SO I THINK THE MAIN CHALLENGE\nFOR HILLARY CLINTON IS LIKELY TO BE EXACTLY THIS EXPECTATIONS\nGAME. THIS IS SO MUCH IN THE\nWHEELHOUSE OF WHAT SHE HAS DONE THAT PEOPLE MIGHT THINK THAT IF\nDONALD TRUMP COMES OUT EVEN LOOKING VAGUELY ALIVE, THEN HE\nWILL HAVE DEFLECTED SOMETHING WHERE YOU WOULD EXPECT HER TO BE\nDOMINANT. >> OKAY LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT\nSOME OF YOUR OTHER EXPERTS SAY ABOUT HOW HE WINS THAT NIGHT ON\nTHAT STAGE. SO, WE'LL PULL THAT UP FOR OUR\nVIEWERS. IF HE -- HE'S WITTY, HE'S\nUNAFRAID OF SHOCK VALUE SO HE CAN HAVE SOME MEMORABLE LINES.\nSHE'S MORE CALCULATED AND CAUTIOUS.\nKEEPING IT SIMPLE IS TO HIS ADVANTAGE.\nHE HAS USES EASY-TO-UNDERSTAND LANGUAGE THAT DOES SPEAK TO THE\nVOTERS ON SORT OF A VISCERAL GUT LEVEL.\nSHE HAS YEARS OF GOVERNMENT JARGON THAT SHE MIGHT FALL INTO.\nWHAT ELSE? >> AND I THINK THAT IT'S\nIMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT WHILE WE CALL THESE DEBATES,\nTHEY HAVE NOTHING AT ALL TO DO WITH COLLEGE DEBATES OR HIGH\nSCHOOL DEBATES, OR LEGAL APPEALS DEBATES OR THINGS WHICH ARE\nFUNDAMENTALLY INTELLECTUAL. THESE ARE FUNDAMENTALLY, IN\nTHEIR EFFECT, NOT JUST -- NOT EMOTIONAL SO MUCHES AKIND OF\nHUMAN VIBE. IT'S HOW PEOPLE END UP FEELING\nABOUT THESE TWO CANDIDATES WHO ARE BEFORE THEM, ONE OR THE\nOTHER IS GOING TO BE THE PRESIDENT.\nAND IF SOMETHING IN DONALD TRUMP'S VERY UNUSUAL BEARING ON\nTHE STAGE CATCHES HILLARY CLINTON UNPREPARED, IF IT\nPROVOKES HER INTO A SLUG FOR SLUG, INSULT FOR INSULT MATCH\nWITH HIM OR MAKES HER SEEM -- IF SHE SEEMS TO BE TOO JARGON\nBOUND, OR INDIRECT OR EVASIVE IN DEALING WITH HIS VERY BLUNT,\nVERY SIMPLE STATEMENTS, THAT COULD MAKE HER LOOK BAD.\nTHE MAIN THING WHICH IS NOT MAYBE INSPIRING TO KNOW ABOUT\nTHESE DEBATES BUT SEEMS TO BE TRUE IS THE WAY THAT PEOPLE\nLOOK. HOW DO WE FEEL ABOUT THEM?\nEVEN IF YOU TURNED OFF THE SOUND ON THE TV, HOW WOULD YOU THINK\nABOUT THAT PERSON'S BEARING, CONFIDENCE, EASE, SENSE OF\nHUMOR? SO IF DONALD TRUMP CAN MAKE\nHILLARY CLINTON LOOK ON THE BAD SIDE OF THOSE SORTS OF\nCALCULATIONS, THAT WOULD BE THE WIN FOR HIM.\n>> AND VERY QUICKLY, JIM, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT EACH OF THEIR\nKRYPTONITE IS. AND I THINK THAT FROM YOUR\nARTICLE WHAT YOU'VE SAID IS THAT IF SHE GOES AFTER HIS WEALTH, IF\nSHE POKES FUN AT MAYBE IT NOT BEING AS MUCH AS HE HAS TOUTED\nIT, THAT COULD BE AN AWKWARD MOMENT FOR HIM.\nWHAT'S HER KRYPTONITE? >> I THINK HER KRYPTONITE WOULD\nBE SOMETHING THAT, THAT IF THE MAIN OPPONENT ARGUMENT AGAINST\nHER IS THAT SHE IS, QUOTE, EVASIVE, UNQUOTE.\nIF HE OR THE MODERATOR POSES QUESTIONS TO HER THAT SHE SEEMS\nINDIRECT OR BEATING AROUND THE BUSH IN ANSWERING, THAT IS THE\nWAY THAT SHE COULD MAKE HER SITUATION WORSE.\n>> JAMES FALLOWS, IT IS A FASCINATING READ.\nGREAT TO HAVE YOU SHARE ALL OF YOUR REPORTING WITH US.\nTHANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING ON \"NEW DAY.\"\n>> MY PLEASURE.

A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK TO\nMAKE UP AMONG WOMEN, EVEN THOUGH HE MAY BE LEADING WITH MARRIED\nWOMEN. A LOT OF WHITE WOMEN WHO VOTE\nFOR REPUBLICANS ARE SIDING WITH HER AT THE MOMENT.\n>> MARK, DOES THIS SHOW HOW INFLUENTIAL IVANKA IS IN HIS\nCAMPAIGN?

IF YOU REMEMBER BACK TO THE\nCONVENTION, IVANKA TRUMP WAS TALKING ABOUT THE TRUMP\nORGANIZATION AS IF IT WAS THE SISTERS OF MERCY.\nSOCIAL JUSTICE WAS THE MAIN GOAL OF THE ORGANIZATION.\nAND I THINK EVERYBODY UNDERSTOOD THAT WAS PROBABLY A BIT OF AN\nEXAGGERATION. >> DAVID, LET'S MOVE ON AND TALK\nABOUT PRESIDENT OBAMA TAKING TO THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL TO DESCRIBE\nHILLARY CLINTON. HE DESCRIBES HIMSELF AS FIRED UP\nAS HE LAYS OUT THE CASE FOR HER. LISTEN TO THIS.\n>> I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY WANT TO ELECT HILLARY CLINTON.\nAND SOMETIMES, SOMETIMES FOLKS, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE KIND OF\nSURPRISED BY THAT BECAUSE THEY REMEMBER, MAN, YOU GUYS HAD A\nTOUGH EIGHT YEARS AGO. IT WAS TOUGH BECAUSE HILLARY IS\nTOUGH. EVERY TIME I THOUGHT I HAD THAT\nRACE WON I WAS GOING UP THE ROCKY STEPS.\nI WAS ABOUT TO CELEBRATE AND THEN I LOOK AND SHE'S RIGHT\nTHERE. BUT I HAD SEEN WHAT SHE COULD\nHAVE ACCOMPLISH. I HAD SEEN HOW SMART AND SAVVY\nAND TOUGH SHE WAS. SO, I ASKED HER, I SAID, JOIN MY\nTEAM. >> SO, DAVID, WHAT CAN PRESIDENT\nOBAMA DO FOR HILLARY CLINTON THAT SHE CAN'T DO FOR HERSELF ON\nTHE TRAIL? >> HE'S A SITTING PRESIDENT WHO\nHAS GOT A HIGH ENOUGH APPROVAL RATING, LITTLE BIT SOUTH OF 50%,\nBUT STILL HIGH ENOUGH TO BE EFFECTIVE, WHICH SAYS HOW\nPOPULAR THE DEMOCRATIC BRAND IS IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY.\nAS WE SAID MANY TIMES BEFORE, HE'S SO IMPORTANT TO TRY TO\nRALLY THAT OBAMA COALITION OF '08 AND '12 YOUNGER PEOPLE,\nMINORITIES THAT DELIVERED HIM INTO THE WHITE HOUSE NOT ONCE,\nBUT TWICE. THAT'S SO IMPORTANT.\nIF YOU TALK TO DEMOCRATIC FUND-RAISERS AND OTHER\nDEMOCRATIC SUPPORTERS IN GENERAL THEY HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER\nTHAT BASE IS GOING TO SHOW UP AND THE KIND OF NUMBERS IT\nSHOWED UP FOR BARACK OBAMA. >> DAVID, KEEP MAKING YOUR\nPOINT. LET'S THROW UP THE VOTER\nENTHUSIASM NUMBERS. THEY'RE ACCENTING EXACTLY WHAT\nYOU'RE SAYING. >> I THINK THAT'S WHAT IS SO\nIMPORTANT. WHERE IS THE ENTHUSIASM AND\nSHE'S GOT TO KEEP DOING THAT. NOW, LOOK, SHE CAN DO A COUPLE\nTHINGS AT ONCE. SHE CAN HAVE SURROGATES THAT CAN\nWORK THE BASE AND THEN HAVE DISCLOSURES LIKE COLIN POWELL\nCOMING OUT AND I'M SURPRISED WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM POWELL BEFORE\nAND I'M SURPRISED WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM CONDOLEEZZA RICE AND\nTHE BUSH ADMINISTRATION IMPUGNED IN THEIR OWN FOREIGN POLICY WHO\nCAN MAKE THE CASE HE'S DANGEROUS ON THE WORLD STAGE AND WEFULLY\nUNPREPARED. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE\nGOING TO SEE TOMORROW. A TELEVISION SPECTACULAR ON \"DR.\nOZ\" DONALD TRUMP SAYS HE'S GOING TO REVEAL HIS MEDICAL RECORDS WE\nDON'T KNOW IF THAT MEANS FROM HIS LATEST CHECKUP OR DECADES\nWORTH OF MEDICAL RECORDS. HERE'S HOW DR. OZ DESCRIBES HOW\nHE WILL OR WILL NOT CONFRONT DONALD TRUMP ABOUT WHATEVER\nINFORMATION IS REVEALED. LISTEN TO THIS.\n>> LOOK, THE METAPHOR FOR ME, IS THIS A DOCTOR'S OFFICE A STUDIO.\nI DON'T WANT TO ASK QUESTIONS THAT HE DOESN'T WANT TO ANSWER.\n>> THAT'S NOT HOW A DOCTOR'S OFFICE WORKS, BY THE WAY.\nI WAS JUST IN THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE, AND THE DOCTOR SAYS, 228\nPOUNDS AND I SAID THAT IS PRETTY GOOD, RIGHT?\nSHE SAID, NO, YOUR BMI IS HIGH YOU'RE OBESE.\n>> LET'S HOPE HE'S DRESSED DIFFERENTLY THAN IN A DOCTOR'S\nOFFICE. >> THAT'S GOOD, TOO.\n>> WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN HERE IN THIS TV REVEAL?\n>> MADE FOR TV MOMENT, NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.\nIF ANYONE IS PUTTING MONEY DOWN THAT THEY THINK THEY'RE GOING TO\nGET INTRICATE DETAILS, YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE THE LOSE THE BET.\n48 MINUTES OF BACK AND FORTH. DONALD TRUMP TALKING ABOUT HOW\nHEALTHY HE IS AND I THINK DR. OZ MIGHT ASK HIM WHY HE EATS A LOT\nOF FAST FOOD AND THAT IS GOING TO BE IT.\nMORE QUESTIONS THAT COME OUT OF THIS THAN ARE ACTUALLY ANSWERED.\n>> IS THIS POLITICAL GENIUS TO MAKE IT INTO AN EVENT?\nHOW MUCH CAN OZ TAKE? HE'S A REAL DOCTOR, IT'S A TV\nSHOW. >> NORMALLY WHAT YOU'D DO IS\nHAVE SOME SORT OF A DISCLOSER AND THEN THE NEWS REPORTERS\nWOULD POUNCE ON IT AND WE THE COMMENTATORS WOULD COME IN AND\nTHEN FILTERS OUT TO THE PUBLIC. HE WANTS TO BYPASS ALL OF THAT.\nLET DR. OZ BASICALLY ENDORSE IT JUST BY ALLOWING HIM ON THE SHOW\nAND NOT CHALLENGING HIM AT EVERY TURN AND THEN THE MESSAGE GOES\nOUT AS TRUMP WOULD HAVE IT GO OUT.\nIT'S A PRETTY LOW BAR THAT I THINK MARK IS RIGHT TO SUGGEST.\nHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO CLEAR AND THEN THE REST OF US WILL SORT OF\nCOME AND KIND OF RING OUR HAND AND SAY IF ONLY A REAL POLITICAL\nREPORTER HAD BEEN THERE. DR. OZ HAS A LOT OF\nRESPONSIBILITY. >> LET ME JUST SAY, WE HAVE TO\nSTAND UP FOR TRANSPARENCY HERE AND THIS IS WHAT A FREE PRESS\nSHOULD BE DOING. THIS IS A MAN WHO STILL BELIEVES\nTHAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS NOT AN AMERICAN\nCITIZEN. HAS NOT RELEASED HIS INCOME TAX\nRETURNS WHICH EVERY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HAS DONE GOING BACK TO\nNIXON AND HAS NOT BEEN TRANSPARENT ABOUT HIS MEDICAL\nRECORDS.

IS HE GOING TO GIVE A MAJOR\nPOLICY SPEECH ON CHILD CARE. HE PREVIEWED THE SPEECH A\nLITTLE EARLIER TODAY. TAKE A LISTEN.\n>> TONIGHT, I'M GOING TO ROLL OUT A PLAN TO HELP OUR\nMOTHERS AND OUR FAMILIES GET AFFORDABLE, QUALITY CHILD\nCARE FOR THEIR CHILDREN. AND MY DAUGHTER IVANKA IS\nGOING TO BE INVOLVED. SHE'S THE ONE.\n[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SHE IS THE ONE THAT HAS BEEN\nPUSHING FOR IT SO HARD. DADDY, DADDY, WE HAVE TO DO\nTHIS. AND IT'S TRUE.\nSHE IS VERY SMART AND SHE'S RIGHT.\n>> SOME DETAILS OF THAT PLAN HAVE ALREADY BEEN RELEASED.\nIT INCLUDES SIX WEEKS OF PAID MATERNITY LEAVE,\nDEDUCTING CHILD CARE COSTS FROM INCOME TAX.\nCREATING DEPENDENT DEBT CARE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS AS THEY ARE\nCALLED AND ADDING INCENTIVES FOR EMPLOYERS TO PROVIDE\nCHILD CARE. EARLIER TODAY HILLARY\nCLINTON OFFERED UP PREEMPTIVE REBUTTAL WITH A\nPAIR OF RADIO ADS HIGHLIGHTING HER COMMITMENT\nTO CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. >> SHE TAKES MULTIPLE\nMEDICATIONS A DAY. ONE MEDICINE IS OVER $1,000\nA MONTH. >> AS FIRST LADY, HILLARY\nCLINTON WORKED WITH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TO\nPASS THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM, EXTENDING\nHEALTHCARE TO OVER 8 MILLION CHILDREN, INCLUDING KAYLA.\n>> CHIP HAS BEEN A LIFESAVER FOR US, FOR HILLARY CLINTON\nTO STAND UP FOR CHILDREN'S HEALTH IS HUGE.\n>> POLITICAL PANEL IS BACK AGAIN, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\"\nAARON BLAKE AND POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT MARA LIASSON.\nYOU HEARD ME FUSS WITH NEWT GINGRICH ABOUT W. THIS\nEARLIER. WHAT IS THE POLITICAL EFFECT\nIN YOUR ESTIMATION, AARON, OF DONALD TRUMP COMING OUT\nWITH THIS KIND OF PLAN AT THIS STAGE?\n>> WELL, I THINK HE CERTAINLY IS TRYING TO SHOW\nTHAT HE IS, YOU KNOW, WORKING ON BEHALF OF WOMEN\nVOTERS WHO HE STRUGGLED WITH THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN.\nIS HE SENSITIVE TO THEIR CONCERNS AND THE CONCERNS OF\nWORKING CLASS AMERICANS WHO STRUGGLE TO PAY FOR CHILD\nCARE. I THINK THIS IS MORE OF AN\nEFFORT FOR HIM TO KIND OF TRY AND EXPAND HIS APPEAL TO\nGROUPS THAT MAYBE FEEL ALIENATED BY HIS PRIMARY\nCAMPAIGN. I DO THOUGH THINK THAT THIS\nIS A PLAN THAT IS GOING TO COME UP SHORT OF WHAT\nHILLARY CLINTON IS PROPOSING ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE.\nIT'S GOING TO BE FEWER WEEKS OF CHILD CARE.\nIT'S GOING TO BE, YOU KNOW, BASICALLY LESS THAN THE\nDEMOCRATS ARE OFFERING SO THE QUESTION IS THIS\nSOMETHING THAT REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO\nCOMPETE WITH HILLARY CLINTON ON?\nAND CERTAINLY THE FACT THAT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS\nTALKING ABOUT THIS ALREADY SUGGEST THEY WANT TO HAVE\nTHAT DEBATE. >> YOU KNOW, OF ALL THE MANY\nBEDROCK PRINCIPLES OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THAT DONALD\nTRUMP HAS LAID WASTE TO, SMALL GOVERNMENT\nCONSERVATISM IS ONE OF THEM. HERE HE IS WITH A NEW TITLEMENT.\nMORE GOODIES. I THOUGHT THIS IS WHAT THE\nCONSERVATIVES DIDN'T WANT. PAYS WITH AGE OLD CHESTNUT\nGETTING RID OF WASTE, FRAUD AND ABUSE.\n>> IN WHAT PROGRAM? WHERE IS HE GOING TO LOOK\nFOR THE WASTE? >> CRACK DOWN ON FRAUD IN\nUNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. >> AND APPARENTLY WHEN THE\nESTIMATES ON HOW MUCH WASTE, FRAUD, AND ABUSE THERE IS\nJUST A TINY OF FRACTION OF WHAT THIS THING IS GOING TO\nCOST. >> IF HE GOT INTO IT AND GOT\nINTO IT ALL IT WOULDN'T COVER THE COST OF IT.\n>> WHAT'S SO INTERESTING IS PEOPLE HAVE ACCUSED DONALD\nTRUMP OF BEING STUCK IN THE 80'S IN MANY WAYS FROM\nHAIRSTYLES TO MARRIAGES TO HIS POLICIES.\nWASTE, FRAUD,ENED A ABUSE IS SOMETHING PEOPLE HAVEN'T\nBELIEVED IN SINCE THE 1980S. >> IT WAS ACTUALLY KIND OF A\nJOKE WHY SHOULD NOTED BY THE WAY AS WE ARE SPEAKING HERE\nTHIS EVENT IS NOT IMMEDIATELY GOING TO GET\nUNDERWAY BECAUSE MR. TRUMP AND HIS DAUGHTER IVANKA ARE\nPARTICIPATING IN A ROUND TABLE DISCUSSION.\nIT IS ALSO A STAPLE OF CAMPAIGNS ABOUT THIS VERY\nISSUE. >> NEW FOR TRUMP.\n>> THIS IS VERY MUCH TRADITIONAL CAMPAIGNING.\nAND SPEAKING OF WHICH, YOU KNOW, HE HAS BEEN MUCH MORE\nCONVENTIONAL IN HIS CAMPAIGNING IN RECENT DAYS\nAND WEEKS. >> DISCIPLINED EVEN.\n>> INDEED EVEN DISCIPLINED. DISIKING TO HIS SCRIPTS AND\nSO ON. DOES THAT SEEM IN YOUR\nJUDGMENT TO BE HELPING HIM, MARA.\n>> I THINK IT IS. >> IF YOU LOOK AT THE SPEECH\nHE GAVE ON MONDAY WHERE HE TALKED ABOUT CLINTON'S\nDEPLORABLES COMMENT, I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY WELL\nCRAFTED. I THOUGHT HE HIT ALL THE\nPOINTS HE NEEDED TO. NOW, HE WAS NOT UP THERE\nAD-LIBBING. THIS WAS A SPEECH GIVEN FOR\nHIM DIFFERENT THAN WE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO.\nTHERE ARE FLASHES ALONG THE WAY OF DONALD TRUMP BEING\nDISCIPLINED AND STICKS TO THE THE SCRIPT AND\nDELIVERING A WELL-RECEIVED PROMPTER SPEECH AND THEN A\nCOUPLE DAYS LATER HE CAN'T RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO\nCREATE THAT YOU CONTROVERSY AND SHIFT THE FOCUS BACK TO\nHIM. >> HE HASN'T DONE THAT\nLATELY. >> YES.\nSHE STOOD UP AND SHOCKED SOMEONE IN FRONT OF 20,000\nPEOPLE SHE WOULDN'T BE PROSECUTED MAYBE THAT WAS\nTAME COMPARED TO HIS OTHER DEPARTURES FROM THE SCRIPT.\n>> HE DOES SEEM TO BE IF NOT RISING IN THE POLLS.\nHE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE SINKING IN THE POLLS AS HE\nONCE WAS. IS HE LETTING HER TROUBLES\nBE HER TROUBLES WITHOUT GETTING IN THE MIDDLE OF\nTHEM. >> THAT IS SOMETHING HE\nWASN'T ABLE TO DO BEFORE. HE WOULD TAKE VICTORY AND\nTHROW IT INTO DEFEAT AND GOING ON A TANGENT ABOUT A\nMEXICAN AMERICAN JUDGE. WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE\nPOLLS IS SHE HAS COME DOWN AND HE HAS STAYED RELATIVELY\nFLAT. HE HAS BEEN AT LEAST SENATOR\nENOUGH TO STEW IN HER OWN JUICE.\n>> DON'T GO AWAY AS WE AWAIT FOR THIS SPEECH BY IVANKA\nTRUMP. CAN SHE SELL WHAT SOUNDS\nLIKE A NONCONSERVATIVE IDEA TO REPUBLICANS.\nWE WILL GET A SENSE OF THAT NEXT.      e.                        Hi, John.

IS THAT OUT OF CONTROL?\n>> IT IS OUT OF CONTROL. BUT THE THING ABOUT IT IS THERE\nARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD ENOUGH TIME TO LISTEN TO BOTH\nCANDIDATES DISCUSS THEIR ISSUES AND HEARD THE CONTRADICTIONS TO\nTHE DISCUSSION TO THE POINT THAT PEOPLE HAVE MADE THEIR MINDS UP\nAS IT RELATES TO TRUSTING THEM FOR OVERALL HONESTY ON ONE SIDE\nOR THE OTHER. WHERE I THINK IT IS REALLY\nFRAGMENTED IS WE DON'T KNOW WHO THE TRUST, NOT JUST WHO BUT\nWHAT. BECAUSE WE HAVE SPENT SO MUCH\nTIME TALKING ABOUT THE PERSONALITIES AND NOT DELVING\nINTO THE POSSIBILITIES. I WOULD LIKE TO GET AWAY FROM\nTHE LARGER-THAN-LIFE PERSONALITIES RATHER THAN WHAT\nTHEY ARE GOING TO DO SPECIFICALLY.\nWE ARE GETTING SOME OF IT BUT NOT ENOUGH OF IT.\nAND THOSE OF US WHO UNDERSTAND WE NEED LEADERSHIP THAT IS\nPREPARED TO DEAL WITH THE KINDS OF CRISES WE JUST MEMORIALIZED\nON 9/11, WE REALLY WANT TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE\nTHEIR POLICIES, WHAT ARE THEIR LEADERSHIP SKILLS AND\nSPECIFICALLY WHAT LEVEL OF EXPERIENCE THEY BRING TO THE\nTABLE.

AND HE HAS A DIFFERENT RULE BOOK\nFROM HILLARY CLINTON WHO APPROACHES THIS LIKE A\nPOLITICIAN. AND THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT RULE\nBOOKS.
