I CAN TELL YOU, WOLF WHAT HAS\nSTUCK OUT TO INVESTIGATORS IS THE FACT THAT THE BOMBING\nSUSPECT DID VERY LITTLE TO COVER HIS TRACKS.\nIN FACT, ACCORDING TO THE CRIMINAL COMPLAINT, 12\nFINGERPRINTS WERE RECOVERED FROM THAT PRESSURE COOKER THAT NEVER\nWENT OFF ON 27th STREET, AND INVESTIGATORS SAY THOSE\nFINGERPRINTS BELONG TO THAT BOMBING SUSPECT.\nWOLF? >> ALL RIGHT, PAMELA, THANK YOU.\nPAMELA BROWN WITH THE LATEST INFORMATION.\nBRINGING IN CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TOM FUENTES, FORMER\nASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF THE FBI. WHEN YOU SAW THIS ANNOUNCEMENT\nPUT OUT FOUR DAYS INTO THIS INVESTIGATION, WHY DID IT TAKE\nSO LONG FOR THE FBI TO SHOW THE PICTURES OF THESE TWO\nINDIVIDUALS SAYING THESE ARE WITNESSES, MAY HAVE GOOD\nINFORMATION? CLEARLY THEY WANT TO INSPECT\nTHAT BAG THEY FOUND. WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG TO PUT\nTHEIR PICTURES UP? >> I THINK THEY THOUGHT WE HAVE\nHAVE LOCATED IN BEFORE NOW. LOOKING FOR THEM THE FIRST TIME,\nSATURDAY NIGHT WHEN IT CAME OUT TWO INDIVIDUALS REMOVED THE\nCONTENTS OF THE DUFFEL BAG. TURNED OUT TO BE THE PRESSURE\nCOOKER BOMB IN THE WHITE PLASTIC BAG.\nTHEY WOULD BE IMMEDIATELY LOOKING FOR THEMA POSSIBILITY\nSTANDING AROUND ON A STREET CORNER CHATTING WHEN RAHAMI\nBROUGHT THAT DUFFEL BAG UP AND SET IT ON THE SIDEWALK AND WOULD\nHAVE BEEN ABLE TO DESCRIBE HIM RIGHT AWAY EVEN BEFORE THEY EVER\nHAD ANYBODY'S VIDEOS INCLUDING RAHAMI'S.\nWOULD HAVE BEEN KEY WITNESSES RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING OF\nTHIS. WHY THEY WAITED THIS WAY I'M\nSURE THEY HAD A REASON OTHER THAN, YOU KNOW, HOPING THEY\nWOULD COME IN OR MIGHT, NOT BE FRIGHTENED AND MAKE IT LOOK LIKE\nYOU KNOW, THEY MIGHT GET ARRESTED AND THROWN AWAY IN\nJAIL. >> HOPING THESE TWO GUYS WHO\nKNEW THEY FOUND THAT BAG WOULD JUST SAY YOU KNOW WHAT?\nMAYBE WE HAVE INFORMATION. MAYBE THERE ARE FINGERPRINTS ON\nTHAT BAG THAT WOULD BE USEFUL TO THE FBI INVESTIGATION.\nLET'S GO REPORT IT OURSELVES. >> EXACTLY.\n>> SAY WE FOUND THIS BOMB. DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS A BOMB BUT\nSAW THE SUITCASE AND TOOK THE SUITCASE.\nI ORIGINALLY THOUGHT WHEN I HEART ABOUTED TWO INDIVIDUALS,\nFOUND A BOK INSIDE THE PLASTIC BAG, THE TWO HUMBLEST GUISE JUST\nWANTED TO TAKE THE BAG FOR WHATEVER REASON.\nSO THE VIEWERS THE PICTURE. THESE TWO GUYS DO NOT LOOK LIKE\nHOMELESS GUYS. THEY'RE PRETTY WELL DRESSED,\nCASUALLY DRESSED, WALKING AROUND THE STREETS OF NEW YORK CITY.\nSO CLEARLY THESE ARE NOT TWO HOMELESS MEN.\n>> NO. THEY DON'T APPEAR TO BE AT ALL.\n>> AT LEAST THEY DON'T APPEAR TO BE.\nTHEY BAREAPPEAR TO BE TWO GUYS. LAW ENFORCEMENT, JUST WANTS\nWITNESSES, QUESTION THEM, GET EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS.\nI READ THE POSTER SEEKING INFORMATION, UNKNOWN\nINDIVIDUALS. FBI'S ASKING FOR THE PUBLIC'S\nASSISTANCE IN LOCATING THESE TWO UNKNOWN INDIVIDUALS.\nCLOSED-CIRCUIT TELEVISION RECORDERS INDICATE THESE\nINDIVIDUALS LOCATED LUGGAGE ON THE SIDEWALK REMOVE PD AND\nIMPROVISED DEVICE FROM THE LUGGAGE AND LEFT THE VICINITY\nLEAVING THE DEVICE BEHIND, BUT TAKING THE LUGGAGE, AND\nDESCRIBED WHERE THIS ALL TOOK PLACE.\nBUT WHAT SORT OF JUMPED OUT AT ME, YOU'RE AN FBI EXPERT, SERVED\nIN THE FBI HOW MANY YEARS? >> 30.\n>> 30. A FORMER ASSISTANT DIRECTOR.\nEND OF THE NOTICE, IF YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION CONCERNS THIS\nCASE PLEASE CONTACT THE FBI TOLL-FREE TIPLINE,\n1-800-CALL-FBI. YOUR LOCAL FBI OFFICE.\nTHESE WORDS JUMPED OUT AT ME. TELL ME IF THIS IS ROUTINE OR\nNOT. OR THE NEAREST AMERICAN EMBASSY\nOR CONSULATE. DO THEY ROUTINELY NAUG LY IN IF\nLOOKING FOR GUYS IN THE UNITED STATES?\n>> ON OCCASION. ONE REASON THIS WEEKEND,\nTHOUSANDS OF VISITORS ARE IN NEW YORK FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY ON A\nREGULAR, DAILY BASIS. THOUSANDS MORE HAD COME IN LAST\nWEEK FOR THE UNITED NATIONS FESTIVITIES, AND HAVING WORKED\nINTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, RUN THE OPERATIONS MY LAST FIVE\nYEARS, ON THE BOARD OF INTERPOL, I WOULD HEAR THIS ALL OVER THE\nWORLD THAT INDIVIDUALS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD FEAR THEIR\nPOLICE. THEY FEAR THAT IF THEY GO TO THE\nPOLICE DON'T WANT TO BE WITNESSES, DON'T WANT TO BE\nANYTHING BECAUSE THEY MIGHT GET THROWN IN JAIL AND NEVER HEARD\nOF AGAIN. THERE'S THAT INTERNATIONAL FEAR\nAND THAT'S WHY, PUT A COMMENT IN THERE IF YOU'RE WORRIED, CONTACT\nYOUR CONSULATE, FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY, CONTACT YOUR EMBASSY,\nMAKE SURE YOU'RE PROTECTED AND YOUR RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED.\nIT'S A CAUTIONARY NOTE FOR OUTSIDERS TO NOT FEAR U.S. LAW\nENNOERSMENT. >> SORT OF JUMPED OUT ALSO WAS,\nIT'S BEEN FOUR DAYS SINCE THAT WHOLE INCIDENT, ON SATURDAY.\nAND MAYBE THESE TWO GUYS LEFT THE UNITED STATES BY NOW AND ARE\nMAYBE SOMEPLACE OUT OF THE COUNTRY AND IF PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF\nTHE COUNTRY KNOW THESE GUYS, RECOGNIZE, BEING WATCHED AROUND\nTHE WORLD NOW, YOU CAN CONTACT YOUR NEAREST AMERICAN EMBASSY\nFOR CONSULATE. LOTS OF QUESTIONS.\nPOLICE SAYING THEY'RE WITNESSES, JUST WANT TO QUESTION THEM.\nTHE RIGHT NOW THEY'RE NOT SEEN AS SUSPECTS OR ANYTHING ALONG\nTHAT LINE. THEY WANT THEM TO VOLUNTARILY\nCOME TO THE POLICE AND REPORT WHAT THEY KNOW AND ESPECIALLY\nHAND OVER THAT BAG. >> AND EVEN IF TOTALLY INNOCENT,\nMIGHT HAVE SEEN RAHAMI, AT THE TIME, HAVE A DESCRIPTION OR NOW\nHAVE INFORMATION RAHAMI GOT IN THE CAR AND CAN DESCRIBE A\nVEHICLE, WITH OTHER INDIVIDUALS. SO THEY COULD STILL HAVE GREAT\nINFORMATION OF VALUE EVEN THOUGH THEY WEREN'T INVOLVED.\n>> TOM, THANKS.",

ALL SHOULD BE IMMENSELY THANKFUL\nAND GRATEFUL TO THE TIRELESS AND SEAMLESS WORK OF THE FBI, NYPD,\nJTTF, LINDEN POLICE DEPARTMENT AND OTHER COUNTLESS AGENCIES WHO\nGOT US TO THE FINISH LINE THERE AND I WANT TO TAKE THE\nOPPORTUNITY TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND THANK THE WORK OF THE\nINVESTIGATORS AND PROSECUTORS IN MY OWN OFFICE WHO WORKED ON THIS\nINVESTIGATION AROUND THE CLOCK. LIKE MANY AGENTS AND OFFICERS AT\nTHE JTTF HAVE BARELY SLEPT SINCE SATURDAY AND CONTINUING TO WORK\nHARD ON THE INVESTIGATION. ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEYS.\nTHEIR SUPERVISOR. AS WELL AS INVESTIGATORS.\nTHANKS TO THEIR WORK YESTERDAY EVENING, WE FILED A FOUR-COUNT\nCRIMINAL CLOMPLAINT CHARGING HA RAMI AGAINST ACTS OF TERRORISM,\nWEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION, BOMBINGS OF A PLACE OF PUBLIC\nUSE AND DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY FOR THE CHELSEA BOMBING.\nFEDERAL CHARGES ALSO BROUGHT AGAINST HIM IN NEW JERSEY AS\nWELL AS FOR THE BOMBS RAHAMI ALLEGEDLY PLANTED IN SEASIDE\nPARK AND ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY. THE FIRST CASE TO PROCEED WILL\nBE THE FEDERAL CASE BROUGHT YESTERDAY IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL\nCOURT. WE HAVE FILED A WRIT FOR RAHAMI\nWITH THE U.S. MARSHAL'S SERVICE. AND SOON BROUGHT INTO THIS\nDISTRICT. THE CHARGES UNSEALED LAY OUT\nCONSIDERABLE EVIDENCE THE FBI AND NYPD WERE ABLE TO GANGER IN\nA LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME. THE EVIDENCE INCLUDES 12\nFINGERPRINTS RECOVERED FROM THE UNDETONATED BOMB.\nINCLUDING ON THE PRESSURE COOKER, DUCT TAPE AND THE\nTRIGGERING CELL PHONE. SURVEILLANCE VIDEO OF RAHAMI\nALLEGEDLY NEAR THE 23rd STREET BOMB.\n27 MINUTES BEFORE THE EXPLOSION. SURVEILLANCE VIDEO OF RAHAMI\nWALKING WITH A SUITCASE NEAR 27th STREET MINUTES AFTER THE\nEXPLOSION. FOUR BLOCKS SOUTH.\nLICENSE PLATE READERS SHOWING A CAR TIED TO RAHAMI'S RESIDENCE\nENTERING MANHATTAN THROUGH THE LINCOLN TUNNEL ABOUT TWO HOURS\nBEFORE THE EXPLOSION. AND LEAVING MANHATTAN ABOUT TWO\nHOURS AFTER. AND ALSO A HANDWRITTEN JOURNAL\nFOUND ON RAHAMI AT THE TIME OF HIS ARREST TALKING ABOUT AMONG\nOTHER THINGS JIHAD, PIPE BOMBS, A PRESSURE COOKER BOMB, AND THE\nSOUNDS OF BOMBS HEARD IN THE STREET, AS WELL AS LAUDATORY\nREFERENCES TO ANWAR AL AWLAKI AND OSAMA BIN LADEN.\nTHIS WEEKEND AS YOU ALL APPRECIATE THE AMERICAN WAY OF\nLIFE WAS ATTACKED, AND EVERY DAY ROUTINES SHAKEN BY EXPLOSIONS IN\nCHELSEA AND SEASIDE PARK. THE RESPONSE TO THESE MISGUIDED\nACTS OF TERROR HAS BEEN CLASSICALLY AMERICAN.\nAND WHAT WE HAVE COME TO EXPECT IN OUR CITY FROM NEW YORKERS.\nCARE FOR THE VICTIMS, CALM IN THE MIDST OF CHAOS AND SWIFT\nACTION. NOW THANKFUL TO THAT RESPONSE\nRAHAMI FACES FEDERAL TERRORISM CHARGES IN A COURT OF LAW.\nLET ME TURN NOW TO WHAT WE CAME HERE TO TALK ABOUT.\nSHOWING IN SOME WAYS DIVERSITY OF OUR DOCKET.\nSOMETIMES LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES US SO PROUD AS WE SAW THIS WEEK.\n>> ALL RIGHT IN RESPECT HE IS.

BIN LADEN, REFERENCES TO FORT\nHOOD, TEXAS, THE TERROR ATTACK REFERENCES TO THE BOSTON\nMARATHON. THESE ARE SERIOUS CHARGES THAT\nHAVE BEEN LEVELLED AGAINST THIS INDIVIDUAL.\n>> RIGHT. WHY HE WENT INTO SUCH DETAIL TO\nDESCRIBE WHAT GOES INTO THOSE CHARGE, WHAT THE PREDICATES WERE\nAND REQUESTING THAT RAHAMI BE BROUGHT TO MANHATTAN AND HOUSED\nIN THE FEDERAL LOCKUP BECAUSE THEY WANT THOSE CHARGES TO\nSUPERSEDE THE LOCAL CHARGES, SERIOUS ENOUGH, SHOOT OUTWITH\nPOLICE THERE, THE MORE SERIOUS CHARGES ARE THE TERRORISM\nCHARGES. >> CHARGED IN NEW JERSEY LOCALLY\nWITH ATTEMPTED MURDER OF A POLICE OFFICER, A SERIOUS CHARGE\nAS WELL. SEVERAL OTHER COUNTS IN NEW\nJERSEY, BUT YOU'RE SAYING THE FEDERAL CHARGES WOULD TAKE\nPRECEDENCE OVER THE LOCAL CHARGES?\nHE WOULD THEN BE BROUGHT TO NEW YORK WHERE HE WOULD AWAIT TRIAL\nON THE FEDERAL CHARGES? >> RIGHT.\nHE'S MAKING THE REQUEST THAT THE MARTIAL'S GO PICK HIM UP AND\nBRING HIM TO MANHATTAN AND HOPING NEW JERSEY OFFICIALS WILL\nACQUIESCE AND SAY JUST TAKE HIM. >> NORMALLY THEY WOULD.\n>> YES. >> A LOT OF NEWS WE'RE\nFOLLOWING.

THE SECOND NIGHT OF PROTETSS.\nTHE DESCRIPTION OF THE INCITING INCIDENT.\nTHE FAMILY OF SCOTT SAYS HE WAS KILLED BY POLICE READING A BOOK\nTHEY SAY AND WAITING FOR HIS SON TO COME HOME FROM SCHOOL.\nPOLICE SAY HE HAD A GUN AND NOT A BOOK.\nPOLICE WERE ONLY THERE BECAUSE THEY WERE TRYING TO SERVE\nANOTHER MAN, NOT TO SCOTT. AND NOW HERE WE ARE WAITING TO\nSEE IN TONIGHT'S PROTESTS WELL-BEING AS SEVERE AS LAST\nNIGHT. DESCRIBE THE SCENE AROUND YOU.\nHOW LARGE THIS R THOSE PROTESTS? >> Reporter: THEY STARTED\nROUGHLY BEFORE 7:00 P.M. ABOUT A HUNDRED PEOPLE OR SO\nOUTSIDE THE POLICE STATION. MOSTLY PEACEFUL.\nA COUPLE OF ENCOUNTERS WITH A OFFICERS ON THEIR BICYCLES\nOUTSIDE THE POLICE STATION BLOCKING THE DOORS.\nTHEY HAVE SINCE MOVED ON AND STARTED CIRCLING DOWNTOWN\nCHARLOTTE. AT OTHER POINTS THEY HAVE\nSTOPPED AT INTERSECTIONINTERSEC. SO FAR POLICE HAVE NOT GIVEN US\nAN INDICATION AS TO WHEN THEY MIGHT RA TRY WRAP THIS UP.\nTHEY ARE HEADING BACK TO THE POLICE STATION AND THE CROWD IS\nGROWING. IT'S ABOUT MAYBE 300 RIGHT NOW\nAND AS MORE AND MORE PEOPLE COME OUT THE CHANTS CONTINUE TO YOU.\nMOSTLY PEACEFUL BUT THERE IS AN AIR OF TENSION IN THE AREA.\nYOU CAN TELL POLICE OFFICERS ARE UNCOMFORTABLE.\nBUT SO FAR THEY HAVE REMAINED PEACEFUL.\nNO FIST FLYING. NOTHING BEING THROWN AT POLICE\nSO FAR. AGAIN WE'LL KEEP IT UPDATED AS\nTHIS CONTINUES. >> AND IS THE POLICE PRESENCE\nSTRONG THERE ON THE STREETS? >> Reporter: SO FAR TO BE HONEST\nIT DOES NOT MATCH THE CROWD. WHAT WE SAW AT THE POLICE\nSTATION WERE SEVERAL DOZEN POLICE OFFICERS LINED UP OUTSIDE\nTHE KPITD. HERE THIS DOWNTOWN HANDFULS OF\nTHE POLICE OFFICERS AND SECURITY OFFICERS MOSTLY.\nWALKING THROUGH AN OUTDOOR MALL AND THAT IS THE CROWD THAT WAS\nWATCHING THEM. THERE ARE NO MORE THAN HALF A\nDOZEN. NOW AS THEY ARE HEADING BACK TO\nTHE POLICE DEPARTMENT, I'M EXPECTING THERE WILL BE MORE OF\nA POLICE PRESENCE THERE AS WE WALK THROUGH THESE POLICE\nOFFICERS YOU CAN SEE THEM START TO MOBILIZE HEADING IN THAT\nDIRECTION. AND AFTER WHAT WE SAW LAST NIGHT\nTHEY WERE LIKELY VERY PREPARED ANDERSON.\n>> APPRECIATE IT. TONIGHT IS THE SECOND NIGHT OF\nPRETTIES AS A LONG TIMES SOMETIMES VIOLENT SEEN ON THE\nSTREETS LAST NIGHTS SOMETHING REPORTING FROM CHARLOTTE.\n>> Reporter: VIOLENT PROTESTS ERUPTED ON THE STREETS OF\nCHARLOTTE HOURS OF KEITH LAMONT SCOTT WAS SHOT AND KILLED BY\nPOLICE. 16 OFFICERS INJURED.\nTEAR GAS USED TO CONTROL THE CROWDS.\nSOME PROTESTERS THREW ROCKS AND BOTTLES AND TRIED TO BLOCK\nROADWAYS. FIVE PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED.\nSHOOTING AFTERMATH CAPTURE ON A FACEBOOK LIVE STREAM BY HIS\nDAUGHTER. THIS IS WHEN SHE DISCOVERS HER\nFATHER IS DEAD. >> THEY JUST SHOT MY [ BLEEP ]\nDAD. THEY JUST SHOT MY DADDY.\nHE'S DEAD. >> THE DAUGHTER LASHES OUT AT\nTHE OFFICERS ON THE SCENE ACCUSING THEM OF PLANTING A\nHANDGUN AT THE SCENE. >> SITTING FROM A CAR READING A\n[ BLEEP ] BOOK. HE AIN'T GOT TO [ BLEEP ] GUN.\n>> Reporter: CHARLOTTE POLICE SAY THERE WAS NO BOOK AND SCOTT\nCAME OUT OF A CAR TWICE WITH A HANDGUN.\nA TEAM OF FOUR OFFICERS ARRIVED IN THE APARTMENT COMPLEX TO\nSERVE A WARRANT TO ANOTHER MAN AND THAT IS WHEN THEY CROSSED\nPATHS WITH SCOTT. >> IT IS TIME TO CHANGE THE\nNARRATIVE. BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU FROM THE\nFACTS THAT THE STORY IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT AS TO HOW IT'S\nBEEN PORTRAYED SO FAR ESPECIALLY THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA.\nSO CHARLOTTE, THE CHALLENGE IS OURS.\nI THINK THE FUTURE CAN BE BRIGHT.\nBUT THE WORK HAS TO BE DONE BY ALL OF US.\n>> BRANTLY VINCENT, THE OFFICER WHO FIRED THE DEADLY SHOTS IS\nALSO AN AFRICAN AMERICAN. HE'S BEEN PLACED ON\nADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE. A YOUNG OFFICER, JOINED THE\nPOLICE FORCE IN 2014, GRADUATED FROM LIBERTY UNIVERSITY WHERE HE\nSTUDIED CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND PLAYED FOO",

POLICE SAY A CIVILIAN SHOT\nANOTHER CIVILIAN DURING A SECOND NIGHT OF PROTEST.\nPOLICE USED TEAR GAS TO DISPERSE THE CROWDS.\nONE POLICE OFFICER HAS BEEN INJURED.\nSCOTT'S WIFE IS CALLING FOR PEACEFUL PROTEST.\nEXPLAIN THE TACTICS THE RIOT POLICE HAVE BEEN USING TO TRY TO\nRECLAIM THE STREETS AND CLEAR THE PROTESTERS.\nRIGHT NOW IT SEEMS IT IS WORKING.\n>> IT IS WORKING. THEY HAD A WHETHER ITLE\nDIFFICULTY DURING THE EARLY PART OF THE TIGHT BUT THEY MAINTAINED\nTHEIR POSTURE AND TRAINING. THEY APPEAR TO HAVE STAYED\nPROFESSIONAL, VERY FOCUSED ON THE MISSION AND THAT WAS TO KEEP\nPEOPLE SAFE AS BEST THEY COULD. I THINK THEY DID AN OUTSTANDING\nJOB TONIGHT CONSIDERING THE NUMBER OF PROTESTERS THAT YOU\nHAD OUT THERE THAT TURNED VIOLENT.\nSO I THINK WE HAVE TO COMMEND THEM ON THE WORK THEY HAVE DONE.\nKEEPING THAT AND DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO KEEP THE\nCOMMUNITY SAFE THERE IN CHARLOTTE.\n>> IT HAS BEEN DANGEROUS WORK FROM WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE\nCHARLOTTE POLICE. THEY JUST PUT OUT NEW\nINFORMATION. WE ARE HEARING THAT FOUR POLICE\nOFFICERS HAVE BEEN INJURED IN THE PAST FEW HOURS.\nTHERE WE ARE. ALL OF THE INJURIES ARE\nNONLIFE-THREATENING. THE PEACEFUL PROTESTERS HAVE NOW\nLEFT. HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE ONES\nSTILL OUT THERE? >> YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A FEW\nTHAT WILL LINGER AROUND BUT OVER TIME THEY WILL MOVE ON, AS WELL.\nTHE POLICE THERE WILL MAINTAIN THEIR PROFESSIONAL POSTURE UNTIL\nTHOSE STREETS ARE CLEARED. A LOT OF WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE\nTHROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE NIGHT.\nTHERE WILL BE PEOPLE RETURNING BACK TO THOSE COMMUNITIES TO\nWORK IN THE MORNING AND TO LIVE. THE COMMUNITY WILL REMAIN SAFE.\nIT WILL STAND SAFE. BUT IT'S A CHALLENGING TIME AT\nTHIS PARTICULAR MOMENT IN CHARLOTTE.\nWE'VE SEEN THESE VIDEO IMAGES BEFORE FOLLOWING THESE TYPES OF\nEVENTS, BUT CHARLOTTE IS A VERY STRONG COMMUNITY AND HAS VERY\nGOOD LEADERSHIP THERE IN THEIR POLICE DEPARTMENT.\nIT'S WITHOUT QUESTION -- I HAVE NO CONCERN THEY WILL PULL THIS\nTOGETHER AND THEY WILL GET THROUGH THIS.\nTHEY IT WILL BE TOUGH BUT THEY WILL GET THROUGH THIS CHALLENGE.\n>> THERE'S BEEN TALK OF DECLARING A CURFEW IN CHARLOTTE.\nDO YOU THINK THAT IS NEEDED RIGHT NOW?\n>> THAT'S A DETERMINATION IN WHICH THE LEADERSHIP THERE, THE\nELECTED OFFICIALS IN THAT STATE AND CITY WILL HAVE TO MAKE.\nTHEY HAVE SOMETIMES CURFEWS WORK.\nTHEY DID NOT WORK VERY WELL IN FERGUSON.\nI KNOW THAT FOR A FACT HAVING BEEN ON THE GROUND IN FERGUSON\nWHEN THE GOVERNOR PUT CURFEWS IN TO PLACE THERE IN MISSOURI THEY\nDIDN'T WORK AT ALL. BECAUSE YOU WILL FIND THOSE WHO\nARE OUT TO DESTROY PROPERTY AND TO NOT EXERCISE THE FIRST\nAMENDMENT RIGHT THE WAY IN WHICH IT WAS WRITTEN.\nTHEY DON'T CARE ANYTHING ABOUT CURFEWS WHATSOEVER.\nIT JUST BECOMES MORE OF A CHALLENGE FOR THE POLICE.\nTHAT WILL BE A DECISION THEY WILL HAVE TO MAKE.\n>> JUST CLEAR SOMETHING UP FOR ME.\nWE SAW A LOT OF CANISTERS BEING FIRED AND WHAT LOOKED LIKE TEAR\nGAS BUT IT IS NOT ALWAYS TEAR GAS.\nSOMETIMES THE POLICE WILL FIRE SMOKE IN TO THE CROWD.\nCAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY THAT IS? >> I THINK WHAT WE SAW TONIGHT\nWAS TEAR GAS UTILIZED. WE ALSO HEARD A NUMBER OF\nFLASH-BANGS THAT WERE USED,ER AS WELL, TO DISRUPT CROWDS AND MOVE\nTHEM ALONG. IT HAS SOMEWHAT OF A SHOCKING\nEFFECT. I THINK WHAT WE SAW TONIGHT WAS\nNOT JUST SMOKE BUT POTENTIALLY TEAR GAS THAT WE USED TO MOVE\nTHE CROWD. IF YOU NOTICED, WHEN THEY\nDEPLOYED TEAR GAS THE CROWDS DID MOVE AWAY.\nAS SOON AS THE TEAR GAS EVAPORATED IN TO THE NIGHT THEY\nCAME BACK. THEY HAD TO REPEAT THE SCENARIO\nA NUMBER OF TIMES BEFORE THEY RECEIVED ANY REAL RESULTS.\n>> OKAY. WE WILL LEAVE IT THERE.\nTHANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. >> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.\n>> MANY NFL PLAYERS HAVE REFUSED TO STAND FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM\nTHIS SEASON TO PROTEST WHAT THEY CALL RACIST POLICE TACTICS.\nTWO OF THEM SAID ON WEDNESDAY, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.\n>> THE REASON THESE GUYS ARE KNEELING, THE REASON WE ARE\nLOCKING ARMS IS TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER TO MAKE PEOPLE AWARE\nTHIS IS NOT RIGHT. IT IS NOT RIGHT FOR PEOPLE TO BE\nKILLED IN THE STREET. >> I'M AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN.\nI'M NOT HAPPY WHAT OR HOW THE JUSTICE HAS BEEN KIND OF DEALT\nWITH OVER THE YEARS, THE STATE OF OPPRESSION IN OUR COMMUNITY,\nBUT WE ALSO, AS BLACK PEOPLE HAVE TO DO RIGHT BY OURSELVES.\nWE CAN'T BE HYPOCRITES. >> SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS\nQUARTERBACK COLIN KAEPERNICK STARTED THE MOVEMENT.\nHE SAID HE IS NOW RECEIVING DEATH THREATS.\nBACK TO CHARLOTTE, AFTER A QUICK BREAK.\nYOU ARE WATCHING CNN.

THE PROTESTERS ARE DEMANDING\nJUSTICE AFTER POLICE SHOT AND KILLED AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN\nON TUESDAY. THE FAMILY OF KEITH LAMONT SCOTT\nSAID HE WAS UNARMED. CNN IS LIVE FROM CHARLOTTE WITH\nAN UPDATE ON THE LATEST. THE QUESTION MANY PEOPLE WOULD\nLIKE TO KNOW. HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ON THE\nSTREETS AND HOW LONG IS THIS EXPECTED TO GO ON FOR?\n>> IT HAS NO END IN SIGHT AT THIS POINT.\nTHERE ARE QUITE A FEW PROTESTERS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET.\nTHEY DISPERSED. WE CAME AROUND AND FOUND POCKETS\nOF MORE. THERE ARE SEVERAL DOZEN PEOPLE\nHERE. I WANT TO SHOW YOU OVER ON THE\nLEFT SIDE WE ARE SEEING REINFORCEMENTS, MORE POLICE\nOFFICERS IN RIOT GEAR COMING FOR THE PROTESTERS TRYING TO MOVE\nTHEM OUT OF THE WAY. THINGS HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY\nPEACEFUL HERE. 20 MINUTES OR SO THERE WAS\nANOTHER AGITATOR THAT GOT CLOSE TO POLICE AND TAKEN BEHIND THE\nLINE AND ARRESTED. THEY HAD TWO LOUD FLASH-BANGS,\nEXEMP EXPLOSIONS BEHIND ME.\nWE HAVE SEEN SEVERAL SUVS DRIVE BY, SLOW DOWN IN FRONT OF THE\nCOPS, MAKE A COUPLE OF LOOPS AND TURN AROUND.\nIT'S A SITUATION THAT IS TENSE. NOT AS INTENSE AS BEFORE WHERE\nTHERE WERE REGULAR ROUNDS OF TEAR GAS AND PEPPER PRAY BEING\nUSED TO GET THE CROWD TO MOVE. RIGHT NOW THERE IS A LINE OF\nPOLICE OFFICERS TO THE LEFT COMING OFF A CITY BUS.\nIT LOOKS LIKE THEY WILL TRY TO FORCE THESE FOLKS TO DISPERSE.\nWE HAVE HEARD OVER A LOUD SPEAKER SEVERAL TIMES, NOT AT\nTHIS CORNER BUT IN OTHER AREAS THIS MORNING TELLING PEOPLE THEY\nHAVE TO LEAVE AND GET OUT OF THE WAY.\nTHEY ARE ASKING FOLKS TO DO SO PEACEFULLY OR TO RISK, YOU KNOW,\nPHYSICAL FORCE. WE ALREADY SEEN THEM SHOOT\nNON-LETHAL PELLETS AT PEOPLE. ONE OF OUR SECURITY PEOPLE GOT\nHIT BY ONE. THE SITUATION STILL UNFOLDING\nHERE. NOT NEARLY AS DESTRUCTIVE AS\nWHAT WE SAW BEFORE. WE WERE STANDING OUTSIDE OF A\nHOTEL WHERE WE SAW SEVERAL PEOPLE THROWING ROCKS THROUGH\nWINDOWS. AT ONE POINT, FROM WHAT WE\nUNDERSTAND, SOME PROTESTERS GOT INSIDE THE HOTEL AND PUNCHED\nSOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE TAKING CARE OF THE HOTEL, WHO\nWERE WORKING THERE. WE HAVE SEEN REPORTERS GET\nKNOCKED DOWN TO THE GROUND, WE HAVE SEEN FIRES SET IN THE\nSTREETS AND ROCKS AND TEAR GAS CANISTERS THAT POLICE ARE\nTHROWING AT PROTESTERS THROWN BACK AT THEM.\nIT HAS BEEN CHAOS HERE. IT IS APPEARS IT IS STARTING TO\nSLOW DOWN BUT I'M TELLING YOU THINGS MAY GET HEATED AGAIN AS\nWE WATCH THESE OFFICERS GET CLOSER TO THE CROWD.\nTHEY ARE GOING TO TRY TO FORCE THESE FOLKS TO MOVE OUT OF THE\nWAY. THIS CROWD HAS BEEN VERY, VERY\nHEATED. THEY HAVE GONE BACK AND FORTH\nYELLING AT THE POLICE AND THROWING THINGS AT THEM.\nWE ARE GOING TO KEEP AN EYE ON WHAT IS GOING ON HERE.\nLOOKS LIKE THEY ARE GOING TO TRY TO FORCE THESE FOLKS OFF THE\nSTREET CORNER. THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY WITH THEIR\nHANDS UP, NOT MOVING. MANY OF THEM ARE ON THEIR PHONES\nFILMING THIS FOR SOCIAL MEDIA. THAT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE SEEN A\nLOT OF TONIGHT.

BUT OBVIOUSLY POOE POLICE FORCED\nTHE DEMONSTRATORS OFF THE CORNER.\nAS THEY SHOOT HANDS UP DON'T SHOOT.\n>> BORIS, ARE YOU STILL THERE? IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON,\nDO YOU KNOW WHY POLICE DECIDED TO MOVE NOW OR IS THAT PART OF\nTHE PROTEST GOING ON FOR SEVERAL HOURS NOW TO TIGHTEN THE CIRCLE\nAROUND THE PROTESTERS TO CLEAR THE CITY?\n>> I'M SORRY, JOHN, I MISSED THE FIRST PART OF YOUR QUESTION.\nTHE PROTESTERS ARE GETTING VERY LOUD AND POLICE ARE MOVING\nCLOSER TO THE CENTER OF THE INTERSECTION.\nTHEY REALLY WANT THESE FOLKS TO GO HOME.\nOBVIOUSLY WE KNOW SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HURT TONIGHT.\nTHERE HAS BEEN EXTENSIVE PROPERTY DAMAGE.\nTHEY ARE TRYING TO GET THEM TO GO HOME.\nTHIS STARTED 6:30. THERE ARE 100 PEOPLE IN FRONT OF\nA POLICE STATION AND IT WAS A PEACEFUL PROTEST, SOME PEOPLE\nHAVING CONVERSATION, EMOTIONAL DRAMATIC CONVERSATIONS WITH\nOFFICERS BUT IT QUICKLY ESCALATED AND NOW AS WE GET\nCLOSER TO 2:00 A.M., WE ARE WATCHING THE REMNANTS OF THIS\nVERY VIOLENT DEMONSTRATION SLOWLY STARTING TO WITHER DOWN.\nTHE DANGER IS STILL VERY REAL. AS I MENTIONED, THERE ARE SUVS\nTHAT KEEP PASSING BY. HERE COMES ANOTHER ONE.\nTHEY START TO DO LOOPS IN FRONT OF THE POLICE.\nOBVIOUSLY THAT'S A CONCERN. CONSIDERING THE EVENTS WE HAVE\nSEEN THAT HAVE UNFOLDED IN BATON ROUGE A FEW WEEKS AGO, THE\nATTACK ON POLICE IN DALLAS, AS WELL IT HAS TO BE HARROWING FOR\nTHE POLICE OFFICERS AND PROTESTERS, AS WELL.\nSOME WERE HERE TO DEMONSTRATE PEACEFULLY.\nI WOULD SAY MOST OF THE FOLKS DEMONSTRATING PEACEFULLY HAVE\nGONE HOME NOW. WE HAD THREATS AGAINST US.\nMY COLLEAGUE GOT SHOVED TO THE GRUND.\nTHE DANGER IS REAL ALTHOUGH THERE ARE ONLY A COUPLE DOZEN\nPROTESTERS LEFT ON THIS CORNER. >> BORIS, WE APPRECIATE THE\nUPDATE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR WHAT\nIS HAPPENING AT YOUR LOCATION. IN THE MEANTIME, THERE'S LIVE\nPICTURES. I WANT TO BRING IN CRIMINAL\nDEFENSE ATTORNEY AND SOCIAL COMMENTATOR.\nOFTEN WHEN THESE PROTESTERS TURN VIOLENT MANY PEOPLE ASK HOW IT\nHELPS THE CAUSE, DAMAGING CARS, LOOTING STORES THIS IS WHAT\nCHARLOTTE'S MAYOR HAD TO SAY. >> THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE\nPROTESTING PEACEFULLY. THERE ARE FOLKS WHO ARE WORKING\nHARD TO GET THEIR MESSAGE OUT WITHOUT CREATING VIOLENCE AND\nDESTROYING THINGS. I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO REMEMBER\nIS THAT THIS IS A SMALL SECTION OF A POPULATION.\n>> OKAY. LET ME SEND IT TO YOU.\nARE THESE PROTESTS, VIOLENT CLASHES, ARE THEY A DISTRACTION\nHERE? >> IT'S NOT JUST A DISTRACTION.\nONE PERSON CAN'T DO -- THIS IS A MOB MACHINE TALLTY.\nIT IS ALMOST THE MIRROR IMAGE OF WHAT THE PROTESTER THES ARE\nCLAIMING THE POLICE TO BE. IT'S NOT ONE BAD COP.\nIT IS WHICH ENTHESE COPS ARE ALLOWED TO KILL PEOPLE IN THE\nPOLICE AND POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND PRECINCTS CONTINUE TO NOT\nPROSECUTE THEM. SO IF PROTESTERS, VIOLENT\nPROTESTERS CAN BE DISPERSED WITH TEAR GAS AND NON-LETHAL BULLETS\nAND A MOB OF PEOPLE, HOW CAN INDIVIDUALS BE SHOT DEAD IN THE\nSTREET? >> BRIAN, TO THAT POINT?\n>> I THINK THE PROBLEM WE HAVE IN DEALING WITH ANY PROTEST\nAFTER A LAW ENFORCEMENT KILLS A BLACK MAN IS IT'S COMBUSTION.\nYOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE FRUSTRATED.\nTHEY WANT ANSWERS QUICKLY, BUT THE PROBLEM IS YOU ARE NOT GOING\nTO GET ANSWERS QUICKLY. I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN PLENTY\nOF POLICE SHOOTING CASES. SOMETIMES IT CAN TAKE SIX TO\nEIGHT MONTHS TO COMPLETE A COPIOUS INVESTIGATION.\nWHEN PEOPLE WANT ANSWERS QUICKLY.\nTHAT I WANT TRANSPARENCY AND DON'T GET IT THEY RUN TO THE\nSTREET. >> YOU CAN ALSO SAY THIS IS THE\nEND RESULT OF WHAT MANY PEOPLE IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN CALL\nSYSTEMIC RACISM IN A CITY OF LIKE CHARLOTTE.\nFOUR OF THE SIX PEOPLE KILLED BY POLICE THIS YEAR IN CHARLOTTE\nHAVE BEEN BLACK. WE LOOK AT THE NUMBERS AND\nBLACKS ARE OVERWHELMINGLY STOPPED, DETAINED, HAVE FORCE\nUSED AGAINST THEM BY THE VIOLENCE.\n>> AND THE BEHAVIOR TONIGHT IS NOT THE RESULT OF ONE SHOOTING\nTHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY. IT IS THE RESULT OF MANY YEARS.\n>> SYSTEMIC RACISM THAT THESE PEOPLE -- LOOK, THERE'S NO\nWELL-THINKING BLACK PERSON THAT IS FOR VIOLENT PROTESTS THAT\nWANTS TO SEE BLACK FACES THAT LOOK LIKE MINE JUMPING ON THE\nROOFS OF POLICE CARS BUT THAT PERSON ON THE ROOF OF THE POLICE\nCAR WENT HOME THAT NIGHT. HE WASN'T KILLED.\nHOW CAN A GUY WITH HIS HANDS UP GET KILLED?\nTHAT'S THE FRUSTRATION. >> A LOT OF PEOPLE MAKE THE\nPOINT THE POLICE OFFICER CARRIED OUT THE SHOOTING WAS A BLACK\nPOLICE OFFICER WHO KILLED A PA BLACK MAN AND THAT IS PROOF THIS\nWASN'T RACIALLY MOTIVATED. >> WE MUST FIRST OF ALL SEPARATE\nTHE POWER STRUCTURE OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AN THE COLOR\nTHING TEMPERATURE I'VE SAID BEFORE ON THE SHOW, IT'S NOT --\nIT'S NOT A BLACK-WHITE ISSUE OR THAT ALL COPS OR ALL BLACK\nPEOPLE ARE BAD. THIS IS POLICE DEPARTMENTS NOT\nWEEDING OUT BAD APPLES AND NOT TRAINING THEM PROPERLY AND YOU\nARE SEEING FRUSTRATION OUT OF THEM NOT BEING TRAINED PROPERLY.\n>> A WE WATCH THE PICTURES IN NORTH CAROLINA WE CAN SEE POLICE\nARE STILL OUT THERE. IT IS 1:40 IN THE MORNING RIGHT\nNOW. WE HAVE SEEN POLICE WITH RIOT\nGEAR MOVING IN, USING TEAR GAS. A POSSIBILITY THEY COULD USE\nTEAR GAS AGAIN TO TRY TO CLEAR THE STREETS.\nBRIAN, MUCH OF THE ANGER IN CHARLOTTE CENTERS ON THE POLICE\nDECISION NOT TO RELEASE THE VIDEO FROM THE BODY CAM AND THE\nDASH CAM. THEY SAID THE INVESTIGATION IS\nUNDERWAY. THIS IS A STATE THAT JUST PASS\nPD LAW THAT WILL MAKE IT ILLEGAL NEXT MONTH FOR THE POLICE TO\nRELEASE THIS VIDEO. THIS IS A STATE THAT MANY SAY IS\nNOT MOVING TOWARD TRANSPARENCY BUT AWAY FROM IT.\n>> WE NEED TRANSPARENCY. WE HAVE VIDEO CAMS ON POLICE\nOFFICERS SO THE PUBLIC CAN SEE WHAT IS IN THE VIDEO.\nTHAT IS A BIG PROBLEM WHAT WE ARE SEEING HERE TONIGHT.\nIF WE HAD THAT VIDEO, IT SPEAKS THE TRUTH.\nYOU CAN GLEAN A LOT OF INFORMATION FROM THAT VIDEO.\nTHE PROBLEM WE HAVE THIS IN COUNTRY IS FROM STATE TO\nSTATE -- I'VE GOT A CASE RIGHT NOW, I REPRESENT A HISPANIC MAN\nBEATEN BY A POLICE OFFICER. THE POLICE OFFICER PLED GUILTY\nTO ASSAULT. THAT WAS TWO YEARS AGO.\nI STILL DON'T HAVE THE IT WAS VIDE\nVIDEOTAPED. I STILL DON'T HAVE IT.\n>> A LOT OF PEOPLE, A LOT OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS TO YOUR POINT\nHAVE SAID HOW CAN A TERRORIST IN NEW JERSEY BE TAKEN ALIVE AFTER\nLEAVING BOMBS PLANTED IN TWO STATES AND YET A GUY WITH HIS\nHANDS UP IS KILLED. >> IT IS NOT A SUSPECTED\nTERRORIST. HE WAS IN A FIRE FIGHT.\nIN THE BOSS ON THIS MARATHON BOMBING AND THE NEW YORK BOMBING\nTHEY WERE IN FIRE FIGHTS AND BOTH CAPTURED AND THEY WERE\nALIVE TO BE QUESTIONED. HOW CAN A BLACK MAN WITH HIS\nHANDS UP IN TULSA, OKLAHOMA OR LYING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE\nSTREET HELPING AN AUTISTIC KID IN FLORIDA BEING SHOT WHEN THEY\nARE UNARMED. AGREE THAT BLACK PEOPLE CAN'T BE\nHYPOCRITES. I PAY THESE POLICE OFFICERS TO\nPROTECT AND SERVE. DO BETTER OR CHARLOTTE WILL LOOK\nLIKE BATON ROUGE, FERGUSON, MISSOURI, DALLAS, AND WE WILL GO\nCITY AFTER CITY AFTER CITY SEEING THE SAME THING.\n>> THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. WE WILL TAKE A BREAK.\nWE WILL KEEP AN EYE ON THE IMAGES FROM CHARLOTTE, NORTH\nCAROLINA. YOU CAN SEE THE POLICE IN RIOT\nGEAR. A SMALL NUMBER OF PROTESTERS ON\nTHE STREETS AFTER HOURS OF VIOLENCE THERE.\nA LOT MORE IN JUST A MOMENT. YOU ARE WATCHING CNN.",

ONE PERSON IS IN A CRITICAL\nCONDITION AFTER HE WAS SHOT BY A CIVILIAN.\nDEMONSTRATORS THREW ROCKS AND BOTTLES AT POLICE, INJURING\nLEAST FOUR POLICE OFFICERS. PROTESTERS ALSO ATTACKED A TV\nREPORTER AND A CAMERAMAN THAT WERE TAKEN TO HOSPITAL AND\nTREATED THERE. DEMONSTRATORS SMASHED WINDOWS OF\nA HYATT HOTEL AND ATTACKED TWO EMPLOYEES INSIDE.\nTHE PROTESTS STARTED ON TUESDAY NIGHT AFTER POLICE FATALLY SHOT\nAN AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN.  TRUMP OR HILLARY CLINTON TONIGHT\nIN RESPONSE TO THE VIOLENCE. NOT SURPRISING BUT WE HEARD FROM\nBOTH CANDIDATES EARLIER THIS DAY.\nDONALD TRUMP TALKED ABOUT THE VICTIM IN TULSA, OKLAHOMA SHOT\nBY POLICE. HE SAID SEEMED LIKE A GOOD MAN\nAND HE QUESTIONED THE ACTION OF THE POLICE OFFICER INVOLVED.\n>> HANDS UP, HE WAS DOING EVERYTHING HE WAS SUPPOSED TO\nDO, EVERYTHING. AND A YOUNG POLICEMAN SHOT THIS\nMAN. I DON'T GET IT.\nYOU CAN COME -- I DON'T CARE WHERE YOU ARE COMING FROM,ER\nTHERE WAS SOMETHING REALLY BAD GOING ON.\n>> HAD HIS HANDS UP. >> I DON'T KNOW IF HE CHSHE\nCHOKED. SOMETHING REALLY BAD HAPPENED.\n>> THE LAW AND ORDER CANDIDATE THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN THAT\nSEEMS TO BE A SIGNIFICANT DEPARTURE.\n>> DURING HIS RALLY HE SAID LET'S BE TOUGH, LET'S GO BE\nVIOLENT AND LET THERE BE CASUALTIES MENTALITY.\nALL OF A SUDDEN HE IS PIVOTING TO THE MIDDLE TO TRY TO ADVOCATE\nTO MINORITIES. I'M NOT SURE IF THAT WILL WORK\nFOR HIM. >> THIS IS THE SCENE RIGHT NOW\nIN CHARLOTTE. WE CAN SEE THE RIOT POLICE ARE\nMOVING IN TOWARDS THE PROTESTERS.\nTHIS GROUP OF PROTESTERS SEEM TO BE THE LAST OF AS MANY AS 1,000\nPROTESTERS AT ONE STAGE THAT CLASHED VIOLENTLY WITH THE RIOT\nPOLICE EARLIER IN THE EVENING. AS WE CAN SEE, THIS IS WHAT HAS\nBEEN HAPPENING THE LAST HOUR HOUR OR SO.\nPOLICE ARE MOVING IN, CLOSING OFF THE AREA THE PROTESTERS CAN\nOCCUPY IN DOWNTOWN CHARLOTTE. AGAIN, WE WILL CONTINUE TO WATCH\nTHAT AND TALK ABOUT THE POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE\nPOLICE SHOOTING AND THE VIOLENCE WE'VE SEEN.\nTRUMP'S WEBSITE DOES NOT HAVE A SINGLE DETAIL ON POLICE REFORM.\nINSTEAD WE HEAR FROM HIM OFTEN THE POLICE DON'T GO FAR ENOUGH,\nTHEY NEED TO HARDEN UP. >> THAT'S NOT SURPRISING.\nHE'S NEVER BEEN BIG ON DETAILS. HE CAN PIVOT ALL HE WANTS TO\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS AND LA TEENS. THIS IS THE CHAMPION OF STOP AND\nFRISK A NATIONAL PROGRAM. I HEAR DONALD TRUMP WITH HIS\nCOMMENTS ABOUT TULSA BUT I'M NOT BUYING IT AND NEITHER ARE THE\nMAJORITY OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS. >> I WANT TO HOLD THE DISCUSSION\nFOR NOW. BECAUSE BORIS SANCHEZ IS LIVE IN\nCHARLOTTE WITH AN UPDATE OF WHAT IS GOING ON THERE.\nTELL US THE LATEST, PLEASE. >> WE HAVE OUR GAS MASKS READY\nFIRST AND FOREMOST. WE HEARD ANOTHER ANNOUNCEMENT\nFROM POLICE OVER LOUD SPEAKER SAYING THEY WERE GETTING READY\nTO THE EMPLOY WHATEVER MEANS NECESSARY TO GET PEOPLE OFF OF\nTHE STREET. WE SAW TWO OR THREE DOZEN\nPROTESTERS BUT IT WAS THE LAST HANDFUL OF PROTESTERS.\nTHEY WERE FORCED DOWN THIS STREET AND THAT STREET, AS WELL.\nTHEY HAVE DISPERSED. WHAT I CAN SEE BEHIND ME,\nTHERE'S FEWER THAN TEN PEOPLE LEFT AND THEY ARE FAR FROM THE\nPOLICE OFFICERS. FORTUNATELY, IT APPEARS THE\nSITUATION AT THIS STREET CORNER ENDED MUCH MORE PEACEFULLY THAN\nWHAT WE SAW TONIGHT. EVEN THOUGH I WAS INTENSE AT\nSOME POINTS WITH PEOPLE THROWING OBJECTS A THE POLICE, YELLING AT\nTHEM. THE SUVS I MENTIONED EARLIER,\nCIRCLING THE INTERSECTION. HAD TO MAKE THE OFFICERS NERVOUS\nKNOWING SOME OF THE INCIDENTS WE HAD SEEN PREVIOUSLY.\nYOU CAN SEE SOME OF THE OFFICERS BLOCKING THE STREET.\nWE HAD A DIFFICULT TIME GETTING TO THIS INTERSECTION, PARTLY\nBECAUSE THERE WERE SO MANY ROAD CLOSURES AND IT GIVES YOU AN\nIDEA AS TO THE PROTESTERS MENTALITY.\nTHEY OVERCAME SEVERAL ROAD BLOCKS, SEVERAL HURDLES TO BE\nOUT HERE AT THIS TIME. MANY HOURS AFTER THE INITIAL\nPEACEFUL PROTEST BEGAN ROUGHLY 6:00, 6:30 THIS EVENING OUTSIDE\nOF A POLICE STATION THAT'S A MILE OR SO AWAY FROM WHERE WE\nARE RIGHT NOW. IT MOVED FROM THERE TO A PARK.\nTHE PEACEFUL ATTITUDE WAS MORE LESS IN TACT THERE.\nTHERE WERE PEOPLE PRAYING AND CHANTING SLOGANS.\nTHINGS ESCALATED WHEN WE CAME DOWN.\nTHINGS CAM CALMING DOWN NOW. BACK TO YOU.\n>> GREAT, BORIS, WE APPRECIATE THE UPDATE.\nTHE LATEST ON WHAT APPEARS TO BE THE END OF THE PROTESTS.\nEVERYONE SEEMS TO BE HEADING HOME.\nON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SITUATION, HILLARY CLINTON WAS\nON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND SAID THE SHOOTINGS WERE UNBEARABLE\nBUT DID NOT EXPLICITLY BLAME THE POLICE.\n>> EVERY DAY POLICE ACROSS OUR COUNTRY ARE SERVING WITH\nEXTRAORDINARY HONOR, COURAGE AND SKILL.\nWE SAW THIS THIS WEEKEND IN NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY AND MINNESOTA.\nOUR POLICE HANDLED THE TERRORIST ATTACKS EXACTLY RIGHT AND LIKELY\nSAVED A LOT OF LIVES. >> AGAIN, THIS SEEMS TO BE A\nDELIBERATE DECISION BY THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN.\nDONALD TRUMP SEEM TO REPRESENT THAT.\nI THINK WHEN IT COMES TO STYLE HILLARY CLINTON WINS.\n>> I DON'T THINK SO. I MEAN DONALD TRUMP HE WANTS TO\nMAKE STOP AND FRISK A NATIONAL POLICY.\nTHIS IS FROM A MAN WHO JUST TRIED TO GIVE AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nVOTER OUTREACH TO VOTER AUDIENCE.\n>> EVEN KEEL. >> LOVE IT.\n>> I THINK SHE DID THE RIGHT THING.\nTHERE ARE THOUSANDS OF OFFICERS IN THIS COUNTRY WHOEVER DAY DO\nTHE RIGHT THING.

WE WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME OUR\nVIEWERS IN THE UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE WORLD.\nI'M JOHN VAUSE LIVE IN LOS ANGELES WHERE IT HAS JUST GONE\n11 P.M. AND WE ARE FOLLOWING BREAKING NEWS IN CHARLOTTE,\nNORTH CAROLINA. FOR THE SECOND NIGHT PROTESTERS\nHAVE CLASHED VIOLENTLY WITH POLICE.\nTHE CROWDS ARE STARTING TO CLEAR THE STREETS NOW, BUT THE\nSITUATION IS STILL ONGOING. ONE PERSON HAS BEEN SHOT.\nCRITICALLY WOUNDED DURING THESE DEMONSTRATIONS.\nPOLICE SAY THE VICTIM WAS SHOT BY ANOTHER CIVILIAN, NOT BY\nPOLICE. FOUR OFFICERS HAVE ALSO BEEN\nHURT. THE PROTESTS WERE SPARKED BY THE\nPOLICE SHOOTING OF AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN ON TUESDAY.\nLET'S BRING IN BORIS SANCHEZ, WHO IS LIVE IN CHARLOTTE.\nHE IS ON THE LINE. I SEE IT'S RONNIE KARAOKE WHO\nWAS ON THE SCENE A SHORT TIME AGO.\nHE HEARD THE NATIONAL GUARD IS MOVING IN.\nTELL US WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS.\n>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON. I SAW LIKE A LOT OF STUFF GOING\nDOWN UPTOWN IN CHARLOTTE. THIRST OFF, THERE WAS FOUR\nGIGANTIC LINES OF POLICE OFFICERS AND RIOT UNIFORMS\nCREATING HUMAN BARRICADES TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM GETTING INTO\nTHIS I THINK THEY HAD A SAFE ZONE GOING ON.\nEVERYWHERE YOU WENT, THERE WAS BROKEN FWLAS, PEOPLE PROTESTING,\nEVEN PROTESTERS PROTESTING OTHER PROTESTERS.\nLIKE PEOPLE AGAINST WHAT -- YOU KNOW, WHAT SOME OF THE OTHER\nPEOPLE WERE TRYING TO SAY. AND ALL AREN'T IT WAS JUST KIND\nOF HECTIC. NO MATTER WHERE YOU WENT, LIKE\nYOU GO DOWN A COUPLE OF BLOCKS AND IT'S JUST THE SAME THING\nOVER AND OVER AGAIN. IT WAS REALLY WILD OUT THERE\nTONIGHT. >> CAN YOU PUT YOUR FINGER --\nCAN YOU POINT THE ONE THING THAT MAY HAVE TRIGGERED THE VIOLENCE?\n>> I WOULD DEFINITELY SAY IT WAS DUE TO THE DEATH OF KEITH SCOTT\nYESTERDAY. HE WAS -- LAST NIGHT WAS\nACTUALLY MUCH WORSE THAN TONIGHT.\nBUT I'D SAY THAT WAS DEFINITELY THE CATALYST THAT STARTED\nEVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON TONIGHT.\nDEFINITELY, FOR THE MOST PART, PEOPLE WERE KIND OF ANGRY\nTOWARDS POLICE TONIGHT, I COULD SEE.\nAND THEY EVEN STARTED THROWING THINGS.\nSOME PEOPLE STARTED THROWING WATER BOTTLES AT POLICE\nOFFICERS. AND THAT WAS MET WITH TEAR GAS\nAND RUBBER BULLETS THAT THEY SHOT BACK.\nLUCKILY, I WASN'T HIT BY ANYTHING.\nME AND MY FRIEND WERE DOWN THERE.\nBUT WE LEFT PRETTY, PRETTY OKAY. BUT, YEAH, THERE WAS DEFINITELY\nSOME PEOPLE LIKE REALLY UP IN THE OFFICERS' FACES GETTING\nREALLY KIND OF BELLIGERENT. >> AND HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE\nTHE REACTION BY THE POLICE WHEN THE PROTESTERS, AS YOU SAY, WERE\nUP IN THEIR FACE? >> IT WAS VERY, VERY CALM, VERY\nCOOL. LIKE I SAID, THEY ONLY EVER\nRETALIATED WHEN THEY WERE LIKE, YOU KNOW, LIKE ATTACKED FIRST.\nOTHER THAN THAT, I EVEN TALKED TO ONE OF THE OFFICERS.\nI ASKED HIM HOW HE WAS DOING. HE SAID THAT HE WAS JUST TRYING\nTO DO HIS JOB. DIDN'T WANT TO BE OUT THERE BUT\nYOU KNOW, HE HAD TO BE OUT THERE.\nI DON'T KNOW. IT REALLY WASN'T -- IT REALLY\nWASN'T MUCH THAT THEY WERE DOING AGAINST ANYONE OUT THERE.\nIT WAS MORE OF LIKE TRYING TO KEEP EVERYONE UNDER CONTROL.\nTRYING TO MAKE SURE LIKE NO ONE -- NO ONE IS GETTING TOO\nWILD OUT THERE TONIGHT. >> OKAY.\nSO I UNDERSTAND YOU ARE BACK ON CAMPUS RIGHT NOW?\nHAVE YOU BEEN TALKING TO ANY OF YOUR FRIENDS, ANYONE THERE?\nWHAT HAS EVERYONE BEEN SAYING ABOUT THE VIOLENT PROTESTS?\n>> YEAH. I GOT BACK A COUPLE -- ABOUT AN\nHOUR AGO. AND THE FIRST THING PEOPLE SAID\nTO ME BECAUSE LIKE WHY WERE YOU OUT THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE?\nIT'S CRAZY OUT THERE. BUT IT WASN'T AS BAD AS I\nTHOUGHT IT WOULD BE. MOST PEOPLE WERE JUST CONCERNED\nABOUT -- THERE WAS APPARENTLY A SHOOTING TONIGHT.\nSOMEONE WAS KILLED BY ANOTHER CIVILIAN.\nOR HAEB NOT KILLED. BUT I THINK THEY ARE LIKE IN\nINTENSIVE CARE RIGHT NOW. AND THAT WAS THE MAIN CONCERN\nPEOPLE HAD TONIGHT. WHEN I GOT BACK ON CAMPUS, YEAH,\nMOSTLY PEOPLE JUST WONDERING ABOUT THE SHOOTING.\nAND ABOUT HOW THE OFFICERS ARE TREATING THE REST OF US OUT\nTHERE. JUST YOU KNOW, TRYING TO WATCH,\nSEE WHAT WAS GOING DOWN. >> HOW",

HOW MANY PROTESTERS REMAIN ON\nTHE STREETS THERE? >> Reporter: ROSEMARY, IT WAS\nCERTAINLY AN UGLY NIGHT HERE IN DOWNTOWN SHCHARLOTTE.\nWHAT BEGAN AT 7:00 P.M. OR 8:00 P.M. LOCAL TIME TURNED\nVIOLENT QUICKLY. IT WAS IN THE MATTER OF THE LAST\nHOUR OR SO THAT THE FINAL PROTESTERS DISPERSED AND A\nSEMBLANCE OF PEACE RETURNED TO THE DOWNTOWN AREA.\nTHIS IS THE AFTERMATH. WE WANT TO WALK AND WE CAN SHOW\nYOU THIS IS ONE OF THE PROPERTIES HEAVILY DAMAGED.\nWINDOWS SMASHED OUT. THE GENERAL MANAGER OF THIS\nHOTEL IS HAVING TO CLEAN UP AFTER THE MESS HERE.\nMATT, YOU WANT TO TALK TO CNN HERE QUICK AND TELL US WHAT\nHAPPENED LAST NIGHT? WHAT DID YOU GUYS GO THROUGH?\n>> WE HAD A LOT OF PROTESTERS THAT CAME OUT, AND IT WAS A\nLITTLE FRIGHTENING. OUR BIGGEST GOAL IS THE SAFETY\nOF OUR GUESTS AND EMPLOYEES AND REALLY EVERYBODY HERE IN THE\nCITY. SO I HATE TO SEE SOMETHING LIKE\nTHIS HAPPEN IN OUR CITY, BUT I STILL LOVE CHARLOTTE.\n>> WHY HAYAT? IT'S JUST WHERE IT IS IN\nPROXIMITY TO THE DEMONSTRATIONS? >> IT WAS EVERY BUSINESS ON THE\nBLOCK. THEY HIT THE TEAM STORE, THE\nEPICENTER. A LOT OF DAMAGE UP AT THE NASCAR\nHALL OF FAME, A LOT OF THE RESTAURANTS.\n>> Reporter: FROM WHAT YOU SAW, WE WERE TALKING TO DEMONSTRATORS\nAND THEY SAID IT DIDN'T TURN VIOLENT UNTIL THE TEAR GAS.\nWHAT DID YOU SEE? >> EARLY ON IN THE NIGHT, IT WAS\nPEACEFUL. THEY SEEMED LIKE THEY WERE IN\nGOOD SPIRITS. THERE SEEMED TO BE GOOD\nCAMARADERIE, AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.\nTHEY MARCHED UP THE STREET A LITTLE BIT, AND THEN THINGS GOT\nUGLY FAST. >> WE KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT OF\nWORK. TAKE IT EASY.\nWE HAVE TO WATCH OURSELVES. LOTS OF GLASS HERE ON THE\nSTREETS. ROSEMARY, TEAR GAS CANISTERS.\nTHERE WERE RUBBER DEVICES FIRED. THE PROTESTS WERE UP AND DOWN\nABOUT A HALF MILE UP THE STREET. IT'S THE SITE OF ONE OF THE MAIN\nSTADIUMS FOR THE SPORTS TEAMS IN THE CHARLOTTE AREA.\nWHEN WE GOT OUT ON THE STREETS AT 2 A.M., THINGS STARTED TO\nCALM DOWN. THERE'S A HEAVY POLICE PRESENCE.\nYOU SEE MEMBERS OF THE NORTH CAROLINA HIGHWAY PATROL WITH\nLONG GUNS, RIOT GEAR. WE WITNESSED AT LEAST ONE\nARREST. ONE INDIVIDUAL SAID HE WAS JUST\nTAKEN INTO CUSTODY. I'M SURE THE POLICE HAVE A\nDIFFERENT STORY ABOUT THAT. FOUR OFFICERS INJURED OVERNIGHT,\nAND NEWS CREWS AS WELL WERE ATTACKED.\nOUR OWN CNN CORRESPONDENT WAS KNOCKED OVER BY A DEMONSTRATOR\nWHO TOLD HIM TO TELL THE TRUTH BEFORE HE KNOCKED HIM DOWN.\nTHERE WAS A LOCAL AFFILIATE CREW ASSAULTED.\nTHOSE TWO MEMBERS ARE IN THE HOSPITAL FROM OUR UNDERSTANDING.\nTHERE WAS A BIT OF A INDICATION EARLY ON YESTERDAY THAT THERE\nWOULD NOT BE A DEMONSTRATION AND LOCAL COMMUNITY LEADERS WOULD\nFOCUS ON A COMMUNITY TOWN HALL. THAT WAS NOT THE CASE.\nLAST NIGHT WAS JUST AS VIOLENT, PERHAPS EVEN MORE VIOLENT THAN\nTHE FIRST NIGHT. THIS IS ALL SURROUNDING THE\nSHOOTING DEATH OF KEITH SCOTT, A 43-YEAR-OLD BLACK MAN SHOT BY\nPOLICE ON TUESDAY AFTERNOON. PEOPLE HERE, INDIVIDUALS,\nFRUSTRATED OVER WHAT THEY SAY IS A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY BY THE\nPOLICE DEPARTMENT. NO ONE HAS SEEN THE BODY CAM\nFOOTAGE FROM THAT SHOOTING. THAT RESULTED IN A GROWING ANGER\nTOWARD THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. A LIVE STREAM VIDEO BY HIS\nDAUGHTER IN THE MOMENTS AFTER WHERE SHE ALLEGED HER FATHER DID\nNOT HAVE A GUN, WAS CARRYING A BOOK.\nINVESTIGATORS SAY THEY DID NOT FIND THAT BOOK ON THE\nINDIVIDUAL. RATHER, THEY DID FIND A HANDGUN.\nTHEY SAY HE WAS ARMED WHEN THEY OPENED THE FIRE.\nTHE FAMILY TELLING A DIFFERENT STORY.\nTHAT ENCOURAGED DEMONSTRATORS TO COME OUT AND CONFRONT POLICE\nOFFICERS AND LAST NIGHT WE SAW MORE VIOLENCE ON THE STREETS OF\nCHARLOTTE. >> NICK JOINING US FROM THE\nSTREETS OF CHARLOTTE IN NORTH CAROLINA.\nWE'RE GOING TO CATCH UP WITH YOU AGAIN JUST IN THE SECOND PART OF\nTHIS SHOW. SO STAND BY.\nCHRISTIAN SUMMERS WAS AN EYEWITNESS AT THE SCENE FOR\nSEVERAL HOURS. HE'S A STUDENT AT THE UNIVERSITY\nOF NORTH CAROLINA, CHARLOTTE, AND IS BACK ON CAMPUS.\nHE JOINS ME NOW. CHRISTIAN YK THANK YOU FOR\nSTAYING UP LATE TO CHAT WITH US. >> ANY TIME.\n>> WHAT ALL DID YOU WITNESS WHILE YOU WERE OUT ON THE\nSTREETS DURING THE PROTESTS? >> IT WAS AN INTERESTING NIGHT.\nI GOT IN TO WHAT IS IT CALLED, CALDWELL AND EAST TRADE STREET.\nBY THE ARENA AROUND 8:45. WHEN I GOT THERE, THIS WAS TWO\nHOURS AFTER DEMONSTRATORS STARTED SHOWING UP FOR THE\nINITIAL PROTEST. EVERYBODY WAS PRETTY PEACEFUL.\nAND THEN AS I KEPT AWALKING UP TOWARD COLLEGE STREET, TOWARD\nTHE EPICENTER, THERE WERE WAVES OF PEOPLE JUST RUNNING AND\nYELLING AFTER LOUD NOISES AND STUFF LIKE THAT.\nPEOPLE THROWING -- THE POLICE THROWING TEAR GAS.\n>> SO YOU'RE SAYING EVERYTHING WAS PEACEFUL UNTIL THE TEAR GAS\nWAS DISPERSED? >> YES.\nBUT THE PEOPLE WERE RUNNING AND SAYING SOMEONE HAD BEEN SHOT,\nBUT SOMEBODY IS DEAD IN THE STREET.\nAT THIS POINT LIVING IN CHARLOTTE, THE PAST TWO DAYS\nEVERYBODY HAS BEEN REALLY DOWNTRODDEN BECAUSE OF THE\nEVENTS, BECAUSE OUR COMMUNITY OF COLOR -- LIKE, THE PEOPLE OF\nCOLOR IN OUR COMMUNITY ARE JUST BEATEN.\nIT'S JUST ANOTHER HASH TAG, SERIOUSLY.\nWE CAN'T STOP THIS, BUT IT'S ACTUALLY COME TO OUR CITY.\n>> SO WERE YOU THERE AT THE WORST OF THIS WHEN THE PROTESTS\nGOT VIOLENT? >> I WAS THERE -- I DON'T\nUNDERSTAND WHAT EVERYBODY IS REFERRING TO AS THE VIOLENCE.\nI ACTUALLY HAD SEEN NOT IN PERSON BUT ON CNN REPORTS, LIKE\nREPORTERS GETTING TACKLED AND THAT'S NOT COOL, BUT FROM WHERE\nI WAS, I HAVE NOT -- >> RIGHT, BUT THE BREAKING OF\nGLASS FOR MANY OF THESE BUSINESSES.\n>> THE VANDALISM OF THE BUSINESSES AND THE STREETS AND\nLANDSCAPE AND STUFF LIKE THAT, THAT HAPPENED, AND I WITNESSED\nTHAT. I WAS WALKING PAST A RITZ\nCARLTON TOWARD, LIKE, WHAT IS IT, PRETTY MUCH THE CENTER OF\nWHERE EVERYTHING WAS GOING ON WHERE I SAW THE LINE OF POLICE\nAND RIOT GEAR AND A LOT OF PROTESTERS.\nI WAS STANDING ON AN ELEVATOR NEXT TO THE EPICENTER TAKING\nVIDEO, AND THEY STARTED THROWING TEAR GAS.\nEVERYBODY WANTED TO GET OUT. I'M RUNNING BACK.\nPEOPLE ARE STOPPED AND ALL KIND OF JUST SORT OF, HEY, THAT'S IT.\nSO THE LOOTING STARTED THERE, I THINK UNLESS THERE WAS OTHER\nLOOTING SOMEWHERE ELSE. IT WAS LIKE THIS -- ABOUT AT THE\nEPICENTER, AND THERE WAS TALKING, A PERIOD WHERE I WAS\nDOING A LOT OF TALKING BETWEEN THAT AND RIGHT BEFORE THEY WENT\nTO THE TEAM SHOP AT THE HORNETS THING, AND IT WAS AN INTERESTING\nSITUATION, FOR SURE. >> SO, CHRISTIAN, WHY DID YOU\nDECIDE TO BE A PART OF THIS PROTEST, AND WHAT DO YOU THINK\nTHEY'VE ACHIEVED HERE? >> AS FAR AS THE MORE PEACEFUL\nEND OF THE PROTEST THAT WAS GOING ON EARLIER, I THINK THAT\nOUR COMMUNITY IS TRYING TO ACHIEVE -- IT COULD BE A LOT OF\nTHINGS. PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE REALLY JUST\nTRYING TO ATTAIN AWARENESS AND ATTENTION AT SOMETHING THAT'S\nBEEN GOING ON SO LONG AND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN GIVING THEM THE BOOT\nAND NOT LISTENING TO THEIR NEEDS AND WANTS.\nBUT INSTEAD, PEOPLE ARE -- THEY HAVE AN ISSUE OF SPEAKING FOR\nPEOPLE OF COLOR AND ON THE EXPERIENCES OF PEOPLE OF COLOR\nWHICH THEY DON'T HAVE. I'M SORRY.\nI JUST LOST MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT, BUT I DON'T KNOW.\nMY GOAL WAS TO GO THERE AND JUST SHOW MY SUPPORT FOR THE BLACK\nCOMMUNITY AND THE BLACK LIVES MATTER MOVEMENT, BECAUSE BLACK\nLIVES MATTER. IT'S NOT THAT COMPLICATED.\nEVERYBODY SAYS ALL LIVES MATTER. BLACK LIVES ARE A PART OF THAT.\nALL LIVES CAN'T MATTER IF BLACK LIVES DON'T.\n>> ALL RIGHT. CHRISTIAN SUMMERS, THANK YOU SO\nMUCH FOR TALKING WITH US, AN EYEWITNESS THERE AT THE SCENE OF\nTHE PROTESTS.",

WHERE SHE AND HER ALLIES HAVE\nOUTSPENT TRUMP AND HIS BACKERS BY NEARLY A FOUR TO ONE MARGIN\nIN THE STATE. >> THE GOALS WE WILL STRIVE FOR,\nTHE PRINCIPLES WE WILL LIVE BY --\n>> Reporter: SHERRY IS A LONGTIME REPUBLICAN.\nVOTING FOR REAGAN, McCAIN, ROMNEY.\nBUT SHE CAN'T VOTE FOR TRUMP. >> HILLARY IS A SMART WOMAN, AND\nTRUMP IS JUST -- HE'S JUST -- I HATE TO SAY IT, I -- I -- HE'S A\nMANIAC. >> Reporter: ANOTHER MORE HIGH\nPROFILE REPUBLICAN IS ALSO NOT COMMITTING TO VOTE FOR TRUMP.\nPOPULAR OHIO GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH.\nBUT THE KEY NOW IS TURNING OUT THE VOTE.\nAND ORGANIZATIONALLY CLINTON SEEMS TO HAVE THE EDGE WITH 55\nFIELD OFFICES AND PLANS FOR TWO DOZEN MORE COMPARED TO TRUMP'S\n31 SO-CALLED VICTORY OFFICES. EARLY VOTING IN OHIO STARTS IN\nLESS THAN FOUR WEEKS. PLENTY OF TIME, POLITICAL\nEXPERTS SAY, FOR THINGS TO CHANGE FOR EITHER CANDIDATE.\n>> NOBODY'S GOT THIS STATE WRAPPED UP.\n>> I DON'T THINK SO. >> THE REAL QUESTION NOW IS NOT\nWHICH CANDIDATE VOTERS MAY GO FOR, BUT WILL VOTERS ACTUALLY\nVOTE AT ALL. AN EARLY INDICATION YOU COULD\nLOOK AT THE APPLICATIONS FOR ABSENTEE BALLOTS IN THE STATE.\nWELL OVER A HALF MILLION HAVE BEEN FILED.\n40,000 AHEAD OF THIS SAME PERIOD IN 2012.\nALISYN AND CHRIS? >> MARTIN THANK YOU.\n>> APPRECIATE IT, PAL. OUR BATTLEGROUND SERIES\nCONTINUES TOMORROW. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE YOU TO THE\nTIGHT RACE IN NORTH CAROLINA. CLINTON LOOKING TO MAKE SOME\nHISTORY THERE. WE HAVE MUCH MORE ON OUR\nBREAKING COVERAGE OF THE VIOLENCE IN CHARLOTTE.\nLET'S GET TO IT. >> THIS IS CNN BREAKING NEWS.\n>> GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE. WELCOME TO YOUR \"NEW DAY.\"\nWE DO HAVE SOME BREAKING NEWS FOR YOU BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A\nSECOND NIGHT OF VIOLENT PROTESTS ERUPTING IN CHARLOTTE AS ANGER\nBUILDS OVER THE DEADLY POLICE SHOOTING OF A BLACK MAN.\nNORTH CAROLINA'S GOVERNOR DECLARING A STATE OF EMERGENCY\nTHERE. BECAUSE RIOTS HAVE BROKEN OUT IN\nTHE CITY'S BUSINESS DISTRICT AS YOU CAN SEE ON YOUR SCREEN.\nCLASHING WITH POLICE THERE. >> THERE WERE PROTESTERS,\nLEGITIMATE ONES BUT ALSO VANDALS SHATTERING WINDOWS OF DOWNTOWN\nBUSINESSES THAT LEAD TO ONE PERSON CRITICALLY WOUNDED AND\nFOUR OFFICERS WERE ALSO HURT. THE BIG QUESTION IN CHARLOTTE\nIS, WHY WON'T OFFICIALS RELEASE VIDEO THAT THEY SAY -- THAT THEY\nSAY, PROVES THEIR ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS SHOOTING\nOF KEITH LAMONT HILL SCOTT THAT HE HAD A GUN?\nWE'RE GOING TO TALK WITH SOMEBODY WHO HAS SEEN THAT DASH\nCAM VIDEO. WHAT DOES HE SEE?\nWE HAVE EVERY ANGLE COVERED. LET'S BEGIN WITH NICK VALENCIA\nLIVE IN DOWNTOWN CHARLOTTE. >> GOOD MORNING, CHRIS.\nTHE RIOTS LAST NIGHT WERE RESTRICTED TO DOWNTOWN CENTRAL\nBUSINESS DISTRICT. THE NEIGHBORHOODS SEEM TO HAVE\nBEEN SPARED BUT NOT THE BUSINESSES HERE, ESPECIALLY ON\nTHIS STREET. BEHIND ME YOU COULD SEE THE\nAFTERMATH LOOTERS TARGETING THIS SOUVENIR SHOP.\nPOLICE UNFORTUNATELY ANTICIPATE MORE OF THE SAME TONIGHT.\nOVERNIGHT A STATE OF EMERGENCY DECLARED IN CHARLOTTE.\nTHE GOVERNOR DEPLOYS THE NATIONAL GUARD.\n>> WE CANNOT TOLERATE VIOLENCE, THE DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY, AND\nWILL NOT TOLERATE THE ATTACKS TOWARD OUR POLICE OFFICERS.\n>> Reporter: VIOLENT PROTESTS ERUPT FOR A SECOND NIGHT.\nIN THE CHAOS A MAN LAYS BLEEDING ON THE GROUND FROM HIS HEAD.\nAUTHORITIES SAY ONE PERSON WAS SHOT BY ANOTHER CIVILIAN OUTSIDE\nTHE CITY'S OMNI HOTEL. THAT PERSON IS ON LIFE SUPPORT\nAND IN CRITICAL CONDITION. POLICE DESCEND ON DEMONSTRATORS\nIN RIOT GEAR, FIRING FLASH GRENADES AND DEPLOYING TEAR GAS\nTO DISPERSE CROWDS. BORIS SANCHEZ IN THE MIDDLE OF\nTHE INTENSE SCENE. >> THIGH CLEARLY WANT US OUT OF\nHERE. >> Reporter: ED LAVANDERA CAUGHT\nIN THE FRAME. KNOCKED OVER BY A PROTESTER\nWHILE REPORTING ON LIVE TV. THE PROTESTER LATER APOLOGIZED.\n>> TAKEN OUT THEIR FRUSTRATIONS ON ME.\n>> Reporter: POLICE CONFIRM SEVERAL POLICE OFFICERS SUFFERED\nINJURIES. CHARLOTTE SAYS THEY'LL EXPLORE\nOTHER OPTIONS INCLUDING CURFEWS TO KEEP PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS.\n>> WE ARE WORKING VERY HARD TO BRING PEACE AND CALM BACK TO OUR\nCITY. WE KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT WHO\nCHARLOTTE IS. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE.\n>> COMPLICATING THINGS ARE THESE COMPETING THREADS OF\nINFORMATION, KEITH SCOTT'S FAMSLY SAYS HE WAS UNARMED WHEN\nHE WAS SHOT. POLICE SAY THAT IS NOT TRUE,\nTHEY FOUND A WEAPON ON HIM AND THE REASON THAT HE WAS SHOT WAS\nBECAUSE HE DID NOT COMPLY WITH DEMANDS BY OFFICERS TO DROP HIS\nWEAPON. CHRIS?\nYOU HAVE CALLS FOR JUSTICE IN THE SHOOTING.\nYOU NOW HAVE CALLS FOR WHAT HAPPENED BEHIND NICK VALENCIA.\nSO MORE STORES DAMAGED. THE POLICE CHIEF IS VOWING THAT\nTHE INVESTIGATION INTO KEITH LAMONT SCOTT'S SHOOTING WILL BE\nHANDLED TRANSPARENTLY. BUT THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT\nVERSION VERSIONS.\nTHE POLICE HAVEN'T RELEASED THE VIDEO.\nWE HAVE POLO SANDOVAL LIVE WITH MORE ON THAT ASPECT.\n>> GOOD MORNING. MIXED IN THE GROWING CALL YOU\nJUST MENTION IS ALSO THE GROWING CALL TO SEE SOME OF THOSE VIDEO\nCLIPS THAT WERE SHOT THE DAY OF THE SHOOTING.\nPOLICE DASH CAM FOOTAGE POSSIBLY EVEN SOME OF THE BODY CAMERAS\nTHAT WERE BORN BY SOME OF THE OFFICERS.\nBUT AGAIN AUTHORITIES ARE CITING",

ANOTHER NIGHT OF VERY, VERY BAD\nVIOLENCE ON THE STREETS OF CHARLOTTE NOT FAR FROM WHERE WE\nARE RIGHT NOW, LOOTING, LOT OF PUSH AND PULL WITH THE POLICE,\nARRESTS MADE. WE WILL HOPEFULLY GET SOME\nINFORMATION SOON ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED LAST NIGHT.\nWE ALSO HOPE TO HEAR ABOUT THE CONDITION OF THOSE FOUR POLICE\nOFFICERS WHO WERE INJURED AND OF THE MAN WHO WAS SHOT LAST NIGHT.\nANOTHER PIECE OF INFORMATION THAT THE MAYOR WILL PUT OUT\nHOPEFULLY SOON HERE IS WHETHER SHE WILL INSTITUTE A CURFEW\nTONIGHT AND THAT MAY AFFECT THE BEHAVIOR OF THE POLICE, OF\nCOURSE, AND THE CITIZENRY AS WE LOOK AHEAD TO WHO WILL SHOW UP\nON THE STREETS TONIGHT IN CHARLOTTE.\nNOW WITH THE INJURIES THAT OCCURRED LAST NIGHT AND\nOVERNIGHT TO THE POLICE OFFICERS, THAT MAKES 20 POLICE\nOFFICERS WHO HAVE BEEN INJURED OVER THE PAST TWO NIGHTS IN\nCHARLOTTE. DOES THAT CHANGE THE BEHAVIOR OF\nPOLICE ON THE STREET? WILL THEY BE MORE EDGY, LITTLE\nLESS TOLERANT OF PEOPLE, WILL THEY BE MORE QUICK TO MAKE\nARRESTS AND PULL PEOPLE BEHIND THEIR LINES AS THEY WERE DOING\nSPORADICALLY LAST NIGHT? WILL THEY FIRE TEAR GAS AND THE\nSTUN GRENADES THEY WERE FIRING LAST NIGHT WITH MORE FREQUENCY.\nTHAT IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING WE WILL WATCH TONIGHT AS WE LEARN\nMORE INFORMATION ABOUT JUST WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT, THE ARRESTS\nAND SOME OF THE INJURIES. >> WELL, THE COMMUNITY IS\nESPECIALLY EAGER FOR THIS VIDEOTAPE AND WHETHER THE MAYOR\nWILL VIEW THAT VIDEOTAPE LATER THIS MORNING, THEN MAKE THE\nDECISION TO SHOW AT LEAST SOME OF IT TO THE PUBLIC.\n>> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT. AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS\nGOING TO BE A VERY CRITICAL BREAK IN THIS CASE, BECAUSE A\nLOT OF PEOPLE HERE OF COURSE WANT TO SEE THAT VIDEOTAPE.\nTHEY ARE SKEPTICAL OF THE POLICE CLAIM THAT KEITH LAMONT SCOTT\nHAD A FIREARM ON HIM WHEN HE EMERGED FROM THAT CAR AND WAS\nSHOT. THEY SIMPLY DON'T BELIEVE THE\nPOLICE ACCOUNT THAT HE HAD A GUN.\nTHE RELEASE OF THAT TAPE WILL BE VERY CRUCIAL.\nWE WILL SEE HOW THE POLICE AND MAYOR HANDLE THAT IN A FEW\nMINUTES. >> ALL RIGHT.\nSTAND BY, BRIAN TODD.

AT THIS POINT WE UNDERSTAND A\nMAJORITY OF THOSE INJURIES, ESPECIALLY THE POLICE OFFICERS,\nTHEY WERE SIMPLY TREATED AT THE SCENE.\nTHOSE INJURIES RELATIVELY MINOR. NOT COMPARED TO THAT CIVILIAN\nWHO WAS SHOT BY A FELLOW CIVILIAN.\nWE ARE TOLD HE IS STILL IN CRITICAL CONDITION.\nTHAT DOES GO TO SHOW, THOUGH, THE STORY IS IN THE NUMBERS WHEN\nYOU BEGIN TO SEE SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN HURT,\nPARTICULARLY THAT INDIVIDUAL, THAT CIVILIAN.\nTHINGS DID GET EXTREMELY VIOLENT LAST NIGHT AND OF COURSE, THE\nPICTURES ALSO TELL A BULK OF THE STORY AND OUT HERE THIS MORNING,\nI CAN TELL YOU THERE IS A SENSE OF NORMALCY THAT HAS BEEN\nRESTORED BUT THERE IS ALSO SOME OF THE RESIDUAL EFFECTS STILL AT\nTHIS HOUR OF PEOPLE WHO DECIDED TO STAY HOME BECAUSE THEIR\nEMPLOYER SIMPLY SAID STAY HOME. THAT INCLUDES BANK OF AMERICA\nTHAT EMPLOYS HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE HERE IN CHARLOTTE.\nAGAIN, WHAT WE DO EXPECT IN THE NEXT 30 MINUTES OR SO IS TO HEAR\nFROM CITY OFFICIALS AS WE HOPE TO HEAR WHEN AND IF THE CITY\nMAYOR HAS SEEN THAT VIDEO YOU MENTIONED A FEW MOMENTS AGO THAT\nIS CRITICAL TO THE INVESTIGATION, AND ALSO CRITICAL\nTO THE GROWING CALL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND\nTRANSPARENCY OF THIS COMMUNITY AND ALSO WE EXPECT TO HEAR MORE\nABOUT WHAT COULD BE DONE TONIGHT TO TRY TO KEEP THINGS FROM\nSPIRALING OUT OF CONTROL AS WE SAW THE LAST TWO NIGHTS.\n>> ALL RIGHT. THANKS SO MUCH.\nI WANT TO BRING IN SOMEONE WHO WITNESSED LAST NIGHT'S CHAOS,\nREVEREND JAY LEACH, SENIOR MINISTER AT UNITARIAN UNIVERS\nUNIVERSALIST CHURCH OF CHARLOTTE.\nHE WAS STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO THE MAN WHO WAS SHOT.\nHE JOINS ME NOW BY PHONE. WELCOME, SIR.\nTHANK YOU FOR BEING WITH ME THIS MORNING.\n>> THANK YOU. >> SO HOW DID THIS SHOOTING GO\nDOWN LAST NIGHT? >> WELL, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT\nTO KNOW THAT THIS WAS IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT HAD BEEN TO THAT\nPOINT A PEACEFUL PROTEST THAT INCLUDED A LOT OF PEOPLE OF MANY\nDIFFERENT AGES, INCLUDING FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN WHO WERE\nOUT, HAD PASSED BY, ENGAGED WITH A LOT OF POLICE WITHOUT ANY\nINCIDENT. THE POLICE HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT\nJOB AND AS CLERGY, AND THERE WERE A LOT OF CLERGY ON THE\nSTREETS, WE HAVE GREAT APPRECIATION FOR WHAT THEY'RE\nTRYING TO DO. THEY FORMED A LINE OF RIOT\nPOLICE IN FULL RIOT GEAR AND THAT REALLY CHANGED THE TONE OF\nWHAT WAS GOING ON. THE PROTESTERS BEGAN ENGAGING\nWITH THE POLICE IN A MUCH MORE NEGATIVE WAY.\nTHE POLICE THEN BROKE THEIR RANKS AND STARTED WALKING UP THE\nSTREET AND OF COURSE, THE CROWD FOLLOWED THEM.\nAS WE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED. WE WERE VERY CONCERNED THE\nCLERGY WERE TRYING TO STAND BETWEEN THE PROTESTERS AND THE\nPOLICE, AND THE POLICE FOR REASONS WE STILL DON'T\nUNDERSTAND, OPTED TO GO INTO THE ENTRANCE TO A HOTEL GARAGE, A\nVERY NARROW SPACE, A VERY LARGE CROWD WITH VERY HIGH EMOTIONS ON\nALL PARTS. WE NEVER HEARD ANY WORDS FROM\nTHE POLICE, STAND DOWN, BACK UP, DON'T FOLLOW US.\nWE NEVER HEARD ANY OF THAT. WE WERE STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO\nTHEM. I SAID TO MY COLLEAGUE THIS IS\nNOT GOING TO BE A GOOD SCENE, WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE, WE ARE\nNOT SAFE, AND WE TURNED TO WALK AWAY.\nAS WE DID, I HEARD THE GUNSHOT AND LOOKED OVER TO MY RIGHT AND\nTHE MAN FELL TO THE SIDEWALK. HE WAS IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDED BY\n20 OR SO PEOPLE AND THEN A LARGE CROWD CAME RUNNING OUT OF THE\nENTRANCE TO THE GARAGE. THERE WAS SMOKE BOMBS, THERE WAS\nTEAR GAS. I WANT TO CHALLENGE THE CLAIM\nTHAT THIS WAS A CIVILIAN SHOOTING IN PART AND WE HAVE MET\nWITH CITY OFFICIALS, CLERGY WERE MEETING EARLY THIS MORNING WITH\nCITY OFFICIALS, AND SAYING WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL WITH THAT\nNARRATIVE. >> WAIT A MINUTE, REVEREND.\nREVEREND, LET ME BACK UP. BECAUSE POLICE ARE SAYING THAT A\nCIVILIAN SHOT THIS MAN. THE BULLET DID NOT COME FROM A\nPOLICE OFFICER'S GUN. ARE YOU DISPUTING THAT?\n>> WHAT WE SAID TO THE MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCIL IS WHOEVER IS\nCLAIMING TO KNOW WHO SHOT THIS GENTLEMAN NEEDS TO PRODUCE\nEVIDENCE. THE SCENE WAS COMPLETELY\nCHAOTIC. HOW ANYONE WOULD KNOW WITH\nABSOLUTE ASSURANCE WHERE THE SHOT CAME FROM, I DON'T KNOW.\nI WAS RIGHT THERE AND I COULDN'T TELL YOU.\nTHE SCENE WAS COMPLETELY CHAOTIC.\nWHAT THE CLERGY HAVE SAID IS IF POSSIBLE, WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE A\nBALLISTICS TEST SO WE CAN CONFIRM THE STORY THAT THIS\nDOESN'T COME FROM A POLICE FIREARM.\n>> YOU ARE MEETING WITH THE MAYOR LATER TODAY WITH REFERENCE\nTO THIS ISSUE? >> THIS WAS EARLY THIS MORNING.\n>> WHAT DID THE MAYOR SAY? >> I THINK THEY ARE STILL IN THE\nINFORMATION GATHERING STAGE ABOUT THE WHOLE SCENARIO.\nWE RECOGNIZE THEY ARE HEARING FROM MANY DIFFERENT VOICES AND\nWE JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THOSE OF US WHO WERE ON THE\nSTREETS TRYING TO BE A PEACEFUL PRESENCE WERE ALSO HEARD FROM.\nAGAIN, I'M NOT SUGGESTING AT ALL, AT ALL, I WANT TO\nUNDERSCORE, I'M NOT SUGGESTING AT ALL THAT THIS WAS A POLICE\nSHOOTING. I DO NOT KNOW.\nI WAS RIGHT THERE. WHAT I AM SAYING IS THE ABSOLUTE\nASSURANCE THAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING THIS WAS CIVILIAN ON CIVILIAN,\nMY QUESTION IS, HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT.\nBY WHAT MEASUREMENT ARE YOU MAKING THAT CLAIM?\n>> WE MAY FIND OUT SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THAT IN THIS\nPRESS CONFERENCE THAT'S DUE TO HAPPEN JUST 20 MUINUTES FROM NO.\nONE MORE QUESTION FOR YOU BECAUSE THEY TRYING TO KEEP THE\nPEACE LATER TONIGHT. THE NATIONAL GUARD HAS BEEN\nCALLED OUT. YOU SAY THE POLICE IN RIOT GEAR\nKIND OF INFLAMED PASSIONS. DO YOU THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO\nDEPLOY THE NATIONAL GUARD? SHOULD POLICE NOT BE IN RIOT\nGEAR? WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING?\n>> WELL, I'M NOT A POLICING EXPERT.\nIT'S NOT MY AREA OF EXPERTISE. WE ARE TRYING TO BE OUT THERE AS\nA PEACEFUL PRESENCE. WHAT I WITNESSED LAST NIGHT IS\nONCE THE POLICE WERE IN THE RIOT GEAR, THE WHOLE TONE OF WHAT WAS\nHAPPENING CHANGED COMPLETELY. THAT'S WHAT I WITNESSED.\nI KNOW OTHER CITIES HAVE SEEN THIS, WHEN THE POLICE SHOW UP IN\nA HIGHLY MILITARIZED FASHION AND WHEN THE POLICE SEND THE\nNARRATIVE WE'RE PREPARING FOR THE VERY WORST, IT DOES STOKE\nTENSION IN A DIFFERENT WAY, NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.\nDOES THAT MEAN THEY SHOULDN'T DO THAT?\nI'M NOT THE ONE THAT CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION.\n>> ALL RIGHT. REVEREND JAY LEACH, THANKS FOR\nSHARING YOUR STORY. REALLY FASCINATING INFORMATION\nIN THERE. YOU STAY SAFE BECAUSE I KNOW YOU\nWILL BE OUT AGAIN TONIGHT PUTTING YOURSELF BETWEEN THE\nPROTESTERS AND POLICE.",

              "text": ">>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE POLICE\nRESPONSE LAST NIGHT IN CHARLOTTE BECAUSE WE LEARNED SOME\nINTERESTING INFORMATION BEFORE THE BREAK.\nI'M JOINED BY CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST CEDRIC\nALEXANDER AND CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST AND FORMER\nFBI ASSISTANT DIRECTOR, TOM FUENTES.\nTOM, REVEREND JAY LEACH WAS RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE\nPROTEST LAST NIGHT, STANDING RIGHT -- HE WAS STANDING VERY\nNEAR TO THE MAN WHO GOT SHOT. HE SAID ONCE THE POLICE APPEARED\nIN RIOT GEAR AND STARTED LIKE THROWING FLASH GRENADES INTO THE\nCROWD AND USING TEAR GAS, THE MOOD OF THE CROWD CHANGED.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? >> I THINK THE PROBLEM, CAROL,\nIS THAT IF YOU ARE THE COMMANDER IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT, YOU\nHAVE YOUR OFFICERS ON THE STREET AND THEY START TO FEAR THAT THEY\nARE GOING TO BE RECEIVING BOTTLES, CANS AND BRICKS AND\nROCKS THROWN AT THEM OR WORSE, THEN YOU REALLY HAVE A\nRESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT YOUR PEOPLE.\nTHEY ARE NOT, YOU KNOW, OUT THERE FOR TARGET PRACTICE FOR\nTHE PUBLIC TO TAKE SHOTS AT AND BE UNPREPARED.\nI THINK IF I WAS A COMMANDER IN THAT SITUATION, AND HAD THE\nFACTS THAT THEY HAD, I WOULD BE FEARFUL FOR MY OFFICERS AND I\nWOULD WANT THEM IN SOME TYPE OF PROTECTIVE GEAR, AND THE EXCUSE\nTHAT OH, WELL, IT UPSETS THE CROWD AND MAKES THEM VIOLENT, I\nWOULD SAY THAT'S UNFORTUNATE BUT YOU NEED TO PROTECT YOUR\nOFFICERS. YOU DON'T NEED TO SACRIFICE THEM\nON THE STREET JUST TO SATISFY A MOB.\n>> CEDRIC, DO YOU AGREE? >> WELL, I MEAN, LET ME FRAME IT\nA LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY. SEVERAL NIGHTS AGO, COUPLE OF\nNIGHTS AGO WHEN THIS ALL BEGAN, I THINK UP TO THIS POINT, WE\nHAVE HAD 16 POLICE OFFICERS THAT HAVE BEEN INJURED, AND THEY WERE\nINJURED WITH PROTECTIVE GEAR ON. I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE IS\nTHAT THOSE OFFICERS WENT OUT THERE THE LAST COUPLE OF NIGHTS,\nTHEY HAVE CONDUCTED THEMSELVES VERY PROFESSIONALLY, THEY HAVE\nBEEN VERY TEMPERATE, VERY MEASURED.\nYOU HAVE NOT HEARD COMPLAINTS IN TERMS OF THEIR ACTION NOR HAVE\nYOU HAD NEGATIVE FOOTAGE AS IT RELATES TO THEIR ACTIONS.\nI THINK THEY HAVE CONDUCTED THEMSELVES IN A VERY\nPROFESSIONAL MANNER IN LIGHT OF ALL THE VIOLENCE THAT THEY HAD\nTO CONFRONT. I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO\nNOTE IN ALL OF THIS, IS THAT WHEN YOU HAVE SUCH A CROWD WHO\nIS ANGRY, AND ANGRY BASED ON THINGS WHICH NONE OF US CAN\nCONTROL, AND MANY OF US UNDERSTAND WHERE THAT ANGER\nCOMES FROM, BUT IT CANNOT BE TOLERATED BECAUSE YOU WILL HAVE\nLOSS OF LIFE AND PROPERTY. SO THOSE OFFICERS DID AN\nOUTSTANDING JOB. THEY NEED TO BE PROTECTED, THEY\nSHOULD HAVE ON PROTECTIVE GEAR. THAT GEAR IS NOT WHAT'S CREATING\nTHAT TYPE OF BEHAVIOR THAT WE HAVE SEEN FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF\nNIGHTS. THOSE ARE JUST FOLKS WHO ARE OUT\nTHERE TRYING TO CREATE AND TAKING AWAY FROM WHAT THE REAL\nNARRATIVE IS AND UNFORTUNATELY, THAT'S WHAT WE BEGAN TO FOCUS ON\nAND WE LOSE SIGHT OF WHAT THE WHOLE FIRST AMENDMENT\nOPPORTUNITY THAT WE ALL ARE PRIVILEGED TO HAVE IS ABOUT.\n>> SO TOM, THE OTHER THING REVEREND LEACH TOLD ME, HE WAS\nSTANDING VERY NEAR TO THE MAN WHO GOT SHOT, A MAN WHO IS IN\nVERY CRITICAL CONDITION IN THE HOSPITAL THIS MORNING.\nPOLICE IN CHARLOTTE SAY THAT MAN WAS SHOT BY ANOTHER CIVILIAN,\nSOMEBODY ON THE STREET. THE BULLET DID NOT COME FROM A\nPOLICE GUN. REVEREND LEACH SAYS HE WANTS TO\nSEE PROOF BECAUSE HE SAID IT WAS SO CHAOTIC, HE FEARS THAT, HE\nWONDERS HOW CAN POLICE KNOW THAT.\n>> WELL, THE POLICE WOULD KNOW INDIVIDUALLY, OBVIOUSLY, WHETHER\nTHEY HAD A GUN DRAWN OR WHETHER THE GUNS WERE STILL IN THEIR\nHOLH HOLSTERS AND PRESUMABLY THE\nLEADER OF THE POLICE IN THAT SCENE IN THE MIDST OF THE CHAOS\nWOULD HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHETHER HIS\nPEOPLE WERE UNDER CONTROL, WHETHER OR NOT THE OFFICERS DREW\nWEAPONS, BECAUSE THEY FEARED FOR THEIR LIVES AND POSSIBLY SHOT A\nWEAPON IN THE CHAOS. YOU KNOW, THE REVEREND COULD BE\nRIGHT THAT IN THAT CHAOS A POLICE OFFICER FIRED A WEAPON\nBUT THE POLICE OFFICERS AT THE TIME COULD NOT ACCOUNT FOR\nANYONE THAT THEY KNEW OF THAT FIRED A WEAPON AND THAT'S WHERE\nTHAT NARRATIVE WOULD COME AS FAR AS THE POLICE ARE CONCERNED.\n>> I GUESS IT JUST ILLUSTRATES THE DISTRUST THERE IS IN THE\nCOMMUNITY TOWARD THE POLICE, CEDRIC.\n>> YES, IT IS DISTRUST, AND OFTENTIMES THERE'S A LOT OF\nMISINFORMATION THAT IS REPORTED AND IT GETS OUT INTO THE\nCOMMUNITY AND IT BECOMES SOMETHING THAT HAS NOT BEEN\nVALIDATED. I THINK WE HAVE TO BE VERY\nCAREFUL IN TERMS OF THE STATEMENT THAT WE JUST HEARD\nMADE BY REVEREND LEACH, BECAUSE THAT NEEDS TO BE CEMENTED IN\nSOME FACT. BUT THIS WHOLE IDEA OF DOING A\nBALLISTIC TEST ON OVER 300 POLICE OFFICERS THAT ARE OUT\nTHERE THAT NIGHT, ASSUMING THAT ONE OF THEM FIRED A ROUND, I'M\nJUST NOT GOING TO GO ALONG WITH THAT.\nCHARLOTTE POLICE DEPARTMENT IS A PROFESSIONAL DEPARTMENT AND IT'S\nA DEPARTMENT THAT HAS CHALLENGES.\nIT'S LIKE MANY OF US DO ACROSS THIS COUNTRY.\nBUT THAT'S A STRETCH. IF THEY NEED TO INVESTIGATE IN\nTHAT CITY, HE DID DO THE RIGHT THING BY REPORTING IT TO THE\nLEADERSHIP, AND THE LEADERSHIP WOULD FOLLOW UP ON IT, BUT I\nTHINK WE HAVE TO TREAD VERY CAUTIOUSLY HERE WHEN WE START\nHEARING THOSE KIND OF STATEMENTS THAT DON'T HAVE ANY VALIDITY TO\nIT AT THIS POINT. >> ALL RIGHT.\nI HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE.",

TWO FORMER WHITE HOUSE ETHICS\nATTORNEYS RICHARD PAINTER AND NORMAN EISMAN WRITE THIS.\nCOUNSEL FOR A PRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON WOULD HAVE TO ADDRESS\nACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS POSED BY THE CLINT FOUNDATION\nBUT THOSE HAVE BEEN DISCLOSED AND PUBLICLY VETTED.\nTHEY ARE NOWHERE NEAR AS OBSCURE, PROFOUND AND DANGEROUS\nAS TRUMP'S. >> PAINTER WAS THE CHIEF WHITE\nHOUSE ETHICS LAWYER UNDER GEORGE W. BUSH.\nHE HAS ENDORSED HILLARY CLINTON. THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH\nUS, SIR. YOU HAVE CONCERNED ABOUT\nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST THAT DONALD TRUMP MIGHT HAVE.\nWHAT ARE YOUR BIGGEST CONCERNS? >> WELL, I THINK THERE ARE TWO\nTHINGS THAT DONALD TRUMP NEEDS TO DO TO ADDRESS FINANCIAL\nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST. FIRST, HE NEEDS TO DISCLOSE HIS\nTAX RETURNS. AND HE HAS NOT YET DONE THAT.\nWE NEED TO KNOW WHAT LOOPHOLES HE'S TAKING ADVANTAGE OF.\nWHICH PROVISIONS OF THE TAX CODE BENEFIT HIM.\nBECAUSE HE'S GOING TO HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL INFLUENCE OTHER THE\nTAX CODE AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nWE ALSO NEED TO KNOW WHERE HIS INCOME IS COMING FROM AROUND THE\nWORLD. HE HAS INVESTMENTS ALL OTHER THE\nWORLD. HOW MUCH OF THE INCOME IS COMING\nFROM THE UNITED STATES AND HOW MUCH IS COMING FROM OUTSIDE THE\nUNITED STATES IN PLACES LIKE CHINA AND MEXICO AND ALL OVER\nTHE WORLD. THE SECOND THING HE NEEDS TO DO\nIS DIVEST ALL OF HIS BUSINESS EMPIRE AND GET HIMSELF AND HIS\nFAMILY OUT OF IT. IT DOES NOT WORK FOR HIM SIMPLY\nTO TURN MANAGEMENT OF THE TRUMP BUSINESS ENTITIES OVER TO HIS\nSON OR HIS DAUGHTER AND RETAIN OWNERSHIP.\nTHE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST ARE WAY TOO VAST.\n>> THAT'S INTERESTING, BECAUSE ON THAT POINT, HE ALONG WITH HIS\nKIDS DON'T THING THAT IS A PROBLEM.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS SAID HE WILL PUT HIS BUSINESSES IN A BLIND\nTRUST AND HIS KIDS WOULD RUN IT. THEY ALL THINK THAT IS FINE.\nWHY IS IT NOT? FROM YOUR ETHICS STANDPOINT?\n>> WELL, THERE'S NOTHING BLIND ABOUT TURNING ASSETS OVER TO\nYOUR CHILDREN WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT THE ASSETS ARE AND THEN HAVING\nYOUR CHILDREN MANAGE THE ASSETS. THAT'S NOT BLIND AT ALL.\nIT'S LIKE PUTTING A DIAMOND RING IN A SHOE BOX AND PRETENDING YOU\nDON'T KNOW IT'S THERE. A BLIND TRUST IS A VERY\nDIFFERENT SITUATION. SELL ALL THE ASSETS FOR CASH,\nTURN IT OVER TO A TRUSTEE. AND THE INDEPENDENT TRUSTEE\nINVEST IT IN SOMETHING ELSE. AND THAT'S NOT WHAT HE'S TALKING\nABOUT HERE. >> DO YOU WORRY THOUGH THIS\nSENDS A MESSAGE TO OTHER BUSINESSPEOPLE OR FOLKS IN THE\nBUSINESS COMMUNITY WHO MIGHT WANT TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT ONE\nDAY? DOES THIS PRECLUDE THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF OTHER BUSINESS MEN WHO MAY NOT HAVE AS MANY\nETHICAL ISSUES FOR TRYING FOR THE WHITE HOUSE?\n>> NOT AT ALL. WE HAVE MANY VERY SUCCESSFUL\nBUSINESSPEOPLE COME INTO THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION FOR\nEXECUTIVE BRANCH POSITIONS. THEY ARE REQUIRED UNDER FEDERAL\nLAW TO AVOID FINANCIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS.\nIT WOULD BE FOR THEM A CRIPP OFFENSE TO CREATE A CONFLICT OF\nINTEREST WITH THEIR JOB AND THE GOVERNMENT.\nWE'VE RECRUITED VERY MANY SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSPEOPLE.\nTHE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SHOULD BEHAVE HIMSELF OR\nHERSELF IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE OTHER MEMBERS OF HIS OR HER\nADMINISTRATION. >> CAN YOU VERY QUICKLY JUST SUM\nUP WHY THIS SHOULD MATTER TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE?\n>> WELL, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SHOULD CARE ABOUT HAVING A\nPRESIDENT WHOSE LOYALTIES ARE FIRST AND FOREMOST TO THE UNITED\nSTATES. AND TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED\nSTATES. NOT TO HIS OR HER OWN BUSINESS\nINTERESTS. AND THE PRESIDENT SHOULD\nDISCLOSE WHERE HE OR SHE IS GETTING THEIR INCOME.\nWHETHER IT'S COMING FROM THE UNITED STATES OR ELSEWHERE IN\nTHE WORLD. AND WE SHOULD KNOW THAT.\nAND WE SHOULD ALSO KNOW THAT THE FINANCIAL CONFLICTS WILL BE\nAVOIDED. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING\nUS, APPRECIATE YOUR TYPE, SIR. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING\nUS AT THIS HOUR. >> \"LEGAL VIEW\" WITH ASHLEIGH\nBANFIELD LIVE FROM CHARLOTTE STARTS NOW. >> THEY JUST STARTED SHOOTING\nTEAR GAS. OH, MAN.\nOH, MY EYES. >> IT'S A TRAGIC TIME FOR OUR\nCITY. I'M ASKING FOR CALM.\n>> WE RESPONDED IN A WAY THAT WAS FRUSTRATED AND UPSET,\nTELLING AMERICA THIS IS ENOUGH. >> STARTED AS A PEACEFUL\nPROTEST. PEOPLE ARE NOW KICKING THE TEAR\nGAS AT THE POLICE OFFICERS. BREAKING NEWS.\n>> HELLO, EVERYONE, I'M ASHLEIGH BANFIELD LIVE IN CHARLOTTE,\nNORTH CAROLINA. WELCOME TO \"LEGAL VIEW.\"\nWE ARE ON LOCATION BECAUSE YET AGAIN A TOXIC BLEND OF\nRESENTMENT AND FEAR AND DISTRUST ON THE PARTS OF SOME CITIZENS\nTOWARDS THEIR POLICE FORCE. AND IT HAS BLOWN UP INTO\nVIOLENCE. THIS TIME, IT'S CHARLOTTE.\nA MAJOR MODERN AMERICAN CITY UNDER AN OFFICIAL STATE OF\nEMERGENCY. AFTER A SECOND NIGHT OF RAGE\nARISING FROM THE SHOOTING DEATH OF AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN BY\nTHE CHARLOTTE POLICE. FOR ROUGHLY SEVEN HOURS LAST\nNIGHT AND EARLY THIS MORNING, PROTESTERS IN THE CITY'S UPTOWN\nDISTRICT THREW ROCKS, SET FIRES, SMASHED WINDOWS, SMASHED CARS\nAND POLICE FOUGHT BACK WITH TEAR GAS.\nONE PERSON WAS SHOT UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES NOT YET CLEAR, AND\nIS SAID TO BE IN CRITICAL CONDITION.\nPOLICE SAY TWO OFFICERS SUFFERED RELATIVELY MINOR EYE INJURIES.\nWE HEARD FROM CHARLOTTE'S MAYOR AND POLICE CHIEF LATE THIS\nMORNING. I WANT YOU TO HEAR WHAT CHIEF\nKERR PUTNEY SAID",

AROUND 4:00 YESTERDAY, POLICE\nWENT INTO AN APARTMENT COMPLEX PARKING HOT LOOKING FOR A MAN\nWITH AN ARREST WARRANT THAT WAS OUT.\nAND THEY FOUND A MAN IN A CAR WHO GOT OUT.\nALLEGEDLY HE HAD A GUN. HE GOT BACK INTO HIS CAR.\nHE GOT OUT OF HIS CAR, THIS POLICE SAYING HE GOT OUT OF HIS\nCAR, HAD HIS GUN. THEY TOLD HIM TO PUT IT DOWN.\nHE DID NOT PUT ITOWN AND THEY SHOT AND KILLED THE 43-YEAR-OLD\nBLACK MAN. THE FAMILY SAYS THE 43-YEAR-OLD\nWAS WAITING FOR HIS SON TO COME HOME FROM SCHOOL AND WHAT POLICE\nTHOUGHT WAS A GUN, THEY SAY WAS A BOOK.\nWE HAVE TWO DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT STORIES GOING ON THAT\nLED TO THESE PROTESTS HERE TONIGHT.\nTHE SECOND NIGHT WE HAVE STEVE HARRIGAN ON THE SCENE IN\nCHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA. IT'S NOW 12:30 THERE.\nWHAT IS THE LATEST? >> Reporter: ABOUT FOUR AND A\nHALF HOURS IN, SOME VIOLENCE HAS DIED DOWN AND CLEAN UP AS BEGUN.\nYOU CAN SEE WORKERS SWEEPING UP BROKEN GHAS.\nMANY HOTELS HERE WERE VANDALIZED.\nWINDOWS, SMASHED. FIRST BLACK LIVES MATTER WAS\nPAINTED OVER THE WINDOWS AND THEY'RE SMASHED.\nWE SAW POLICE VEHICLES SMASHED, AS WELL AS LUXURY VEHICLES\nSMASHED, TOO. AS FAR AS VIOLENCE GOES IT WAS A\nBACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE POLICE AND THE PROTESTORS.\nPROTESTORS OFTEN HURLING BEER BOTTLES AND ROCKS AT THE POLICE.\nSO FAR TONIGHT AS FAR AS PROTESTORS GO, ONE MAN, SHOT,\nAND NEAR DEATH RIGHT NOW. AND ONE MAN SERIOUSLY WOUNDED.\nRIGHT NOW, WE'RE SEEING SMALL SPARKS OF CONFRONTATION BETWEEN\nPROTESTORS THAT ARE ANGRY, OTHERS TRYING TO KEEP THE PEACE.\nIT'S BEEN THE FIRST TIME THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO CATCH A BIT OF A\nBREATHER. THEY HAVE MASKS UP.\nSOME TAKING A KNEE, GETTING WATER.\nNUMBERS ABOUT 800 ANDY JUST A HANDFUL DOWN HERE NOW.\nTHERE HAVE BEEN PROET YEFS AROUND OTHER PARTS OF THE CITY,\nINCLUDING IN ON HIGHWAY 277. THE REPORTS IN SEEING THOSE\nIMAGES, YESTERDAY, PART OF I-85 WAS BLOCKED OFF AND ONE TRACTOR\nTRAILER WAS LOOTED AND SET ON FIRE.\nSO CONCERNS ON THE ROADS AND HIGHWAYS SURROUNDING THE AREA.\nWE'VE HEARD OF A STATE OF EMERGENCY SO WE DO EXPECT MORE\nRESOURCES TO BE AVAILABLE, PERHAPS MUCH GRANDER SCALE\nTOMORROW TO TRY TO GET A NIGHT OF PEACE AFTER TWO NIGHTS OF\nVIOLENCE HERE IN CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA.\n>> WE'RE GETTING REPORTS, SEVEN POLICE OFFICERS BEING TREATED\nNOW FOR WHAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE MINOR INJURIES AND ONE PERSON,\nAS MENTIONED ON LIFE SUPPORT. >> OUR CAMERA MAN WAS RIGHT\nTHERE AT THE SCENE WHEN IT HAPPENED AND YOU CAN SEE BLOOD\nOUT OF THE BACK OF THE MAN'S HEAD.\nIT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT HE WAS SHOT WITH.\nWHETHER A BULLET OR WHAT HIT HIM.\nTHE CITY OF CHARLOTTE SAYING IT WAS A CIVILIAN ON CIVILIAN\nATTACK, THAT POLICE DID NOT FIRE BULLETS.\nTHE POLICE DID USE A VARIETY OF NONLETHAL FORCE THROUGHOUT THE\nFOUR HOURS HERE. BEAN BAGS, PAINT BALL, AND MACE.\nEACH TIME THE POLICE WOULD FIRE IT WOULD MOVE THE CROWD BACK\nSLOWLY. BUT REALLY REMARKABLY LITTLE PRO\nGRESS AFTER FOUR HOURS, IT TOOK THE POLICE FORCE FOUR HOURS TO\nCONTROL ABOUT FOUR BLOCKS AGAINST THESE PROTESTORS SO\nPERHAPS, TOMORROW, WE'RE GOING TO SEE MORE MAN POWER AND A MORE\nEFFECTIVE OPERATION AGAINST THESE DEMONSTRATORS WHO WILL BE\nLIKELY OUT AGAIN, IN FORCE. >> SOUNDS LIKE NONLETHAL FORCE.\nDID YOU SEE POLICE OFFICERS DRAW GUNS?\n>> NO. WE DIDN'T.\nBUT THIS WERE A LOT OF WAYS TO GET INJURED WHENEVER TEAR GAS\nWAS FIRED, PEOPLE WOULD TAKE OFF AND RUN WHEN CONCUSSION GRENADES\nWERE THROWN, THEY MAKE A TREMENDOUS BOOM AND SHAKE THE\nAIR. SO IT SCARES PEOPLE WHO AREN'T\nFAMILIAR WITH THEM. PEOPLE TAKE OFF PANICKED IN A\nRUN. SO THERE IS A LOT OF WAYS FOR\nMINOR INJURIES. THERE IS STILL TEAR GAS\nLINGERING IN THE AIR HERE, BUT NONLETHAL FORCE AND A LOT OF\nPATIENCE BY POLICE, WHO WERE SWORN AT AND HAD JUST ABOUT\nEVERYTHING THROWN AT THEM THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT.\n>> STEVE HARRIGAN, THANK YOU FOR BEING WITHOUT THERE.\nWE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.\nYOU'RE LOOKING AT IMAGES FROM CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA.",

THERE WERE STREET BATTLES GOING\nON JUST OUTSIDE OF THE RITZ-CARLTON.\nA NUMBER OF CARS SMASHED. THERE WERE TWO STORIES.\nFIRST WAS THE PROTEST THAT STARTED AROUND 6:00 OR 7:00\nTONIGHT. MOSTLY PEACEFUL.\nTHEN BY 8:30 THERE WAS A SHOOTING WITH ONE PERSON\nCRITICALLY WOUNDED NOW ON LIFE SUPPORT.\nAND THEN IT REALLY BEGAN TO SORT OF FLY WITH ROCKETS, TEAR GAS,\nBOTTLES, FIREWORKS. EVERYTHING GOING BACK AND FORTH\nBETWEEN THESE POLICE AND WHAT HAD REALLY BECOME RIOTERS.\nTHERE WERE A NUMBER OF ARRESTS ABOUT 12:30 IS WHEN THE POLICE\nDECIDED TO FINALLY GO HANDS ON, IF YOU WILL, AND STOP THE\nLOOTING THAT HAD BEEN OCCURRING ALL OVER THIS CITY.\nTHE ONE THING THE PROTESTERS SAY IS, THEY'RE JUSTIFIED.\n>> WHETHER I'M HERE, I'M IN SCHOOL, I'M IN MY CAR, YOU SAID\nOKAY A MAN GOT SHOT OVER HERE, RIGHT?\nYOU SAID WHY WOULD I PUT MY WAY IN DANGER'S WAY?\nGUESS WHAT. I COULD BE AT MY WORK, AT\nSCHOOL, IN MY CAR, I COULD STILL GET SHOT BY THE POLICE.\n>> Translator: >> Reporter: YOU CAN SENSE THE\nEMOTION PL THIS MAN WAS KILLED BY POLICE.\nTHE NARRATIVE FROM SOCIAL MEDIA SAYS HE WAS KILLED WHILE SITTING\nIN HIS CAR WAITING FOR HIS SON TO GET OUT OF SCHOOL WHILE\nHOLDING A BOOK. THE POLICE AND THERE ARE\nPICTURES AND WITNESS ACCOUNTS TO BACK THIS UP SAY HE HAD A GUN\nWITH HIM. HE GOT THE GUN OUT OF THE CAR\nAND APPROACHED OFFICERS. THAT'S WHEN HE WAS SHOT.\nIS THIS ABOUT NO JUSTICE, NO PEACE, THESE PROTESTS AND THE\nHIGH YACHTS. OR IS IT ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE?\nONE OF THE MANY STORES LOOTED, PEOPLE ARE ASKING IS THIS ABOUT\nNO JUSTICE, NO PEACE OR NO JUSTICE NO FREE SNEAKERS.\nCAN'T FORGET THAT NORTH CAROLINA IS A SWING STATE.\nWE'RE LESS THAN 50 DAYS TO THE ELECTION AS THE NATIONAL GUARD\nIS EXPECTED ON THE STREETS HERE. >> THAT'S A GOOD POINT.\n>> SO TROUBLING. AND THERE WERE SOME OTHER\nBUSINESSES AS YOU MENTIONED. THE NASCAR HALL OF FAME I\nBELIEVE WAS ONE WHERE THEY LOOTED THAT STORE.\nALSO THE WESTON HOTEL, I UNDERSTAND.\n>> Reporter: THERE WERE A NUMBER OF PLACES THAT WERE LOOTED.\nTHEY TRIED TO BREAK INTO THE  BUFFALO WILD WINGS WHERE THEY\nTRIED TO GRAB LIQUOR BOTTLES. THEY GRABBED HUNDREDS OF\nTHOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF CIGARETTES OUT OF A SOUVENIR\nSHOP. THE SOUVENIR SHOPS ARE SMALLER\nSTORES. THESE ARE PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOODS.\nWE SAW THE SAME THING IN BALTIMORE AS THESE LOOTERS FOR\nNO OTHER IDEA THAN TAKING THE FIVE FINGER DISCOUNT TAKING\nPEOPLE'S LIVELIHOODS. >> AND THEY'RE VANDALIZING THEIR\nOWN STORES THAT THEY RELY ON FOR THEIR LIVES.\nLELAND LIVE FOR US IN NORTH CAROLINA.\nTHANK YOU. >> THANK YOU.\nSO TROUBLING. AND CERTAINLY NOT A\nREPRESENTATION OF THE TOWN I GREW UP IN.\nHERE NOW TO WEIGH IN IS FORMER HOMICIDE DETECTIVE ROD WHEELER.\nTHANK YOU FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING.\n>> SURE, GOOD MORNING. ABSOLUTELY.\n>> LET'S BEGIN WITH YOUR INITIAL THOUGHTS.\nYOU'VE BEEN AT THE SCENE OF SOME OF THE OTHER RIOTS THAT HAVE\nOCCURRED ACROSS THE COUNTRY. YOUR TAKE ON WHAT'S TRANSPIRING\nIN CHARLOTTE? >> WHAT WE SEE HAPPENING IN\nCHARLOTTE IS ALMOST INDICATIVE OF WHAT WE SAW IN FERGUSON,\nMISSOURI, AND BALTIMORE, MARYLAND.\nBUT WHAT CAN THE CITY DO TO QUELL THE VIOLENCE THERE?\nTHERE ARE THREE THINGS THEY CAN DO.\nNUMBER ONE, DON'T STOP COMMUNICATING.\nTHE POLICE CHIEF HAS BEEN COMMUNICATING EVER SINCE THIS\nINCIDENT BEGAN NAP IS A GOOD THING.\nYOU HAVE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE COMMUNITY.\nNUMBER TWO, THE INVESTIGATION HAS TO BE TRANSPARENT.\nIT HAS TO BE WIDE OPEN SO PEOPLE CAN SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.\nAND THEN NUMBER THREE, HEATHER, THE INVESTIGATION NEEDS TO BE\nSWIFT. IT DOESN'T NEED TO TAKE THREE TO\nFOUR WEEKS TO INVESTIGATE A POLICE SHOOTING.\nIF THEY CAN DO THOSE THINGS AND AGAIN KEEP COMMUNICATING, THEN\nMAYBE THAT WILL BEGIN TO QUELL THE PROTESTERS.\n>> YEAH. THAT IS A CONCERN THAT THIS WILL\nEND UP TURNING INTO SOMETHING LIKE A FERGUSON.\nSO THEY HAVE CALLED IN THE NATIONAL GUARD NOW.\nAT WHAT POINT DO THEY MAKE THAT CALL TO SAY THIS IS BIG ENOUGH\nTO CALL IN THE NATIONAL GUARD AND HOW HELPFUL IS THAT GOING TO\nBE ONCE THEY GET THERE? >> ABSOLUTELY.\nTHOSE ARE EXCELLENT QUESTIONS. IS IT THAT PROMPTED THE GOVERNOR\nTO DECIDE TO CALL IN THE NATIONAL GUARD?\nWELL, WE'RE MOVING CLOSER TOWARDS THE WEEKEND.\nANY TIME YOU HAVE A SITUATION LIKE WE SEE IN CHARLOTTE WHEN\nIT'S CONTINUING TO EXPLODE, YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE\nRE-ENFORCEMENTS TO THE LAW ENFORCEMENT.\nTHAT'S WHY THEY DECIDED TO CALL IN THE NATIONAL GUARD.\nTHE NATIONAL GUARD IS GOING TO REALLY BE PLACED ON STANDBY.\nWE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE THEM ON THE FRONT LINES LIKE WE SEE THE\nCHARLOTTE POLICE OFFICERS, BUT IF THE SITUATION DOES GET OUT OF\nCONTROL, THEN YOU'RE GOING TO SEE MORE ACTION ON BEHALF OF THE\nNATIONAL GUARD. I THINK IT'S A GOOD THING,\nTHOUGH, HEATHER, THAT THEY ARE CALLING THEM IN.\n>> LET'S TALK A LULT BIT MORE ABOUT THE TRANSPARENCY ISSUE YOU\nBROUGHT UP. JUST THIS PAST JULY, THE\nGOVERNOR THERE PASSED A LAW I THINK IT'S HB-972.\nAND IT BLOCKS THE RELEASE OF VIDEO FROM POLICE BODY CAMERAS,\nALSO AUDIO AS WELL. IS THAT A GOOD IDEA RIGHT NOW?\nSHOULD THEY HAVE RELEASED THAT ALREADY?\n>> NO, THEY NEED TO RELEASE THAT VIDEO.\nBECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO BE CRITICAL.\nTHAT'S WHY THE COMMUNITY IS IN AN UPROAR.\nLOOK, THERE'S BEEN TWO DIFFERENT STORIES THAT HAVE COME OUT OF\nCHARLOTTE AS LELAND JUST PROPERLY REPORTED.\nTHE ONE SIDE OF THE STORY FROM THE POLICE IS THAT THE SUSPECT\nHAD A WEAPON. THE FAMILY IS SAYING THE SUSPECT\nHAD A BOOK. WELL, LISTEN, IF THERE'S VIDEO\nTO SUBSTANTIATE EITHER POINT, SHOW US THE VIDEO.\nYOU'VE GOT TO BE TRANSPARENT. ONCE THAT VIDEO IS RELEASED, I\nBELIEVE IT'S GOING TO SUPPORT THE POLICE OFFICER.\nBUT THEN THINGS SHOULD BEGIN TO QUIET DOWN AT THAT POINT.\nSO ANY INVESTIGATION LIKE THIS HAS TO BE VERY TRANSPARENT.\nOTHERWISE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE ALL KIND\nOF NARRATIVES OUT THERE ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND THAT'S GOING TO\nKEEP THE FLAMES BURNING IN CHARLOTTE.\nTHAT'S RIGHT. >> WELL, QUICKLY BEFORE WE LET\nYOU GO, IF YOU'RE THE POLICE CHIEF, WHAT ARE YOU DOING AT\nTHIS MOMENT? WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT?\n>> YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW YOU'RE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD.\nYOU'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW YOU'RE GOING TO WORK WITH THE\nCOMMUNITY. THIS WILL EVENTUALLY QUIET DOWN,\nBUT YOU GOT TO BE THERE IN CHARLOTTE.\nYOU GOT TO WORK WITH THE COMMUNITY.\nAND LIKE I SAID EARLIER, YOU HAVE TO CONTINUE TO COMMUNICATE.\n>> AND WE HAVE A CIVILIAN SHOT BY ANOTHER CIVILIAN WHO'S NOW IN\nTHE HOSPITAL IN CRITICAL CONDITION AS A RESULT OF ALL\nTHIS. >> THAT'S RIGHT.\nTHERE WERE WEAPONS OUT THERE. THERE WERE WEAPONS OUT THERE\nLAST NIGHT. IT'S GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE\nGOING FORWARD. BUT WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE\nWHAT HAPPENS. >> WE APPRECIATE YOUR INSIGHT\nTHIS MORNING. THANKS FOR BEING WITH US.\n>> ABSOLUTELY, GUYS.",

LELAND, GOOD MORNING.\n>> Reporter: STEVE, AINSLEY, PETE, GOOD MORNING TO YOU GUYS.\nA LIGHT RAIN NOW COMING DOWN, AND THERE ARE SOME JOGGERS OUT\nON THE STREETS BRAVING THE RAIN THAT IS KIND OF WASHING AWAY THE\nSMELL OF TEAR GAS HERE IN DOWNTOWN CHARLOTTE.\nSTILL THERE'S A NUMBER OF COMPANIES, BANK OF AMERICA,\nWELLS FARGO, DUKE ENERGY, THE HUGE POWER COMPANY DOWN HERE,\nSAYING THEY DON'T BELIEVE DOWNTOWN CHARLOTTE IS SAFE\nBECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED TONIGHT.\nDON'T BOTHER COMING TO WORK TODAY.\nTAKE A LOOK AT ONE OF THE LOOTED STORES.\nEVIDENTLY THE RIOTERS WANTED RED BULL AND CIGARETTES AND TOOK THE\nFIVE-FINGER DISCOUNT HERE DURING THE RIOTS.\nFOUR POLICE OFFICERS ARE INJURED AND NOW THE CAVALRY IS COMING\nIN, THE NATIONAL GUARD COMING IN TO TRY TO RESTORE ORDER.\nWE HAVE ALSO SEEN THE NORTH CAROLINA HIGHWAY PATROL AND\nSTATE TROOPERS ON THE STREETS AS WELL WITH DIFFERENT RULES OF\nENGAGEMENT THAN WHAT WE SAW LAST NIGHT FROM THE CHARLOTTE POLICE.\nAND THE POLICE REALLY LET THINGS GET OUT OF HAND BETWEEN 8:00 TO\n9:30 WHEN ONE PERSON WAS SHOT. HE'S IN CRITICAL CONDITION.\nHE WAS SHOT BY ANOTHER PROTESTOR.\nTAKE A LISTEN TO THE CHIEF OF POLICE DESCRIBING THE SITUATION\nAS IT WAS HAPPENING. >> WE WERE TRYING TO DISPERSE\nTHE CROWD. WE HAVE BEEN VERY PATIENT BUT\nNOW THEY HAVE BECOME VERY AGRANDSONSIVE THROWING BOTTLES\nAND SO FORTH AT MY OFFICERS. SO IT IS TIME FOR US NOW TO\nRESTORE ORDER. >> Reporter: THIS HAS ALL KICKED\nOFF IN ABOUT 36 HOURS WITH THE POLICE SHOOTING OF KEITH SCOTT.\nA MAN IN HIS 40s THAT WAS SHOT BY POLICE.\nACCORDING TO HIS FAMILY, KEITH SCOTT JUST HAD A BOOK IN HIS\nHAND. ACCORDING TO POLICE AND PICTURES\nPUT OUT THERE, KEITH SCOTT HAD A GUN IN HIS HAND.\nAND SINCE RACE HAS BECOME SUCH A BIG ISSUE IN THIS STORY, IT'S\nIMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT OFFICER BRENTLEY VINCENT WHO SHOT KEITH\nSCOTT IS BLACK AS WELL. PROTESTORS ARE OUT HERE ON THE\nSTREETS SAYING THAT DOESN'T MATTER.\nAND THEN THEY TURN INTO RIOTERS AND SAY ESSENTIALLY WE DON'T\nCARE WHO SHOT WHO. WE JUST WANTED AN EXCUSE TO BE\nANGRY. YOU HAVE TO PUT THAT INTO\nCONTEXT. NORTH CAROLINA, AN EARLY VOTING\nSTATE, NOW THIS VIOLENCE ON THE STREET AND THE DYNAMIC THAT'S\nCREATING HERE AND IN CHARLOTTE WITH THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nCOMMUNITY. THOSE OUTSIDE OF THE CITY ARE\nLOOKING INTO WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE.\n>> LELAND VITTERT IS LIVE. THANK YOU.\n>> OLIVIA KING IS THE NIECE OF DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. AND A\nFOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR. AND IN TOWN TO ATTEND THE EVENT\nON STATEN ISLAND TO REPRESENT UNBORN CHILDREN.\n>> THAT IS RIGHT. I'M THE DIRECTOR OF CIVIL RIGHTS\nFOR THE UNBORN AT CREASED -- CHRIST CHURCH.\n>> THIS IS A BLACK ON BLACK ISSUE.\nAND WE ARE HEARING THIS IS ALL ABOUT ANGER.\n>> IT IS ABOUT ANGER. AND I BELIEVE BECAUSE I HAVE SO\nMANY FRIENDS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT OF EVERY ETHNICITY.\nTHE HEART OF THE RESTAURANT -- IF IT TURNS OUT THAT THE OFFICER\nWAS FOLLOWING PROCEDURE, THAT'S A DIFFERENT THING.\nBUT THE CLIP WHERE THE MAN SAYS ALL WHITE PEOPLE ARE DEVILS.\nNO, ALL BLACK PEOPLE ARE NOT ANGELS.\nIF YOU LOOK AT THAT AND SEE THE MATTER OF THE HEART, NOT THE\nSKIN COLOR. SO MARTIN LUTHER WOULD SAY,\nUNDER ONE BLOOD, GOD MADE ALL PEOPLE.\nSO WE ARE BROTHERS AND SISTERS. >> HERE IS A MAN WHO IDENTIFIED\nHIMSELF AS KEITH LAMONT SCOTT'S BROTHER.\n>> OKAY, IF. >> JUST KNOW THAT ALL WHITE\nPEOPLE ARE [ BLEEP ] DEVILS. ALL WHITE COPS AND ALL WHITE\nPEOPLE ARE [ BLEEP ] DEVILS. >> ALL WHITE COPS AND ALL WHITE\nPEOPLE ARE NOT DEVILS. THESE PEOPLE ARE ANGELS.\nYOU HAVE PEOPLE FROM EVERY ETHNICITY WHO GO TO CHURCH AND\nPRAY AND GO TO WORK AND SCHOOL. SO THEIR OWN PIECE IS BEING\nDISTURBED BY PROTESTOR BUT BY RIOTERS.\nCOME FORTH OUTSIDE OF THE FOUR WALLS OF THE CHURCH, GO TO\nCHURCH, BUT THERE ARE SEVEN DAYS IN A WEEK.\nAND TO COME OUTSIDE THE FOUR WALLS AND CALL FOR PEACE AND\nJUSTICE. LET IT BE RIGHT.\nEACH IN OUR OWN NETWORK HAS A MINI TERRITORY.\nWE HAVE LEADERSHIP POTENTIAL WITH SPIRITUAL LEADERS COMING\nFORTH. YOU HAVE TO LEAVE YOUR HOUSE.\n>> PROTESTORS ARE FRUSTRATED JUST TRYING TO DO THEIR JOBS.\nAND THE LAST COUPLE YEARS THEY HAVE BEEN WALKING ON EGG SHELLS\nBECAUSE SOMEONE HAS A CAMERA TAPING THEM DOING SOMETHING.\nNEXT THING YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE LOST ALL -- THE LAW ENFORCEMENT\nOFFICERS, YOU CAN HAVE A BAD APPLE IN THE BARREL.\nTAKE THE APPLE OUT BUT DON'T THROW THE BARREL AWAY.\nAND THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

THERE IS SOME IMAGERY.\nTHERE IS SOME VIDEO OF THE ALTAR INDICATION.\nWE DON'T KNOW HOW EXCULPATORIY OR DAMNING IT WOULD BE, ZPENDING\nON HOW YOU SLOUGH IT. THE MAYORS AND OTHERS ARE GOING\nTO VIEW IT TOMORROW. NO ONE'S HAVING A REAL\nDISCUSSION ABOUT HOW AND WHEN TO RELEASE IT.\nPRESUMABLY WHAT WE HEAR ABOUT IT WILL BE THROUGH LAW ENFORCEMENT\nAND MAYBE ELECTED CITY OFFICIALS.\nTAMMY LIGHTER IN HAS BEEN AMONG OUR CORRESPONDS AT STREET LEVEL\nAND HAS HER ENCOUNTERS WITH PROTESTERS, POLICE AND TEAR GAS.\nTAMMY, WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE NOW?\n>> BRIAN, THERE ARE STILL ABOUT 75 PROTESTERS OUT HERE.\nYOU CAN HEAR THEM CHANTING \"HANDS UP, DON'T SHOOT.\nKWOILTS THE RIOT POLICE HAVE BEEN SLOWLY ADVANCING FOR THE\nLAST 15 MINUTES. THEY'RE ABOUT # 5 YARDS FROM US\nRIGHT NOW AND THEY'VE MANAGED TO MOVE DOWN THE ENTIRE BLOCK.\nTHEY FIRED OFF A FLASH GRENADE MAYBE TWO OR THREE MINUTES AGO.\nIT WAS A LOUD BOOM. A FLASH.\nIT'S MEANT TO STUN PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE MOVING\nFORWARD. THERE HAVE BEEN CONTINUAL PEPPER\nFIRES TIRED OFF. IF YOU GET HIT WITH THEM THEY\nHURT REALLY BAD. NO TO MENTION THEY PUT PEPPER\nSPRAY ALL OVER YOUR CLOTHING. WE'VE SEEN A FEW PEOPLE BENLTD\nOVER WHEEZING AND CAUSING THAT HAVE INHALED SOME OF THOSE\nPEPPER BALLS. BRIAN?\n>> JIM CAVANAUGH CONTINUES TO WATCH WITH US.\nJIM, IT WON'T SURPRISE YOU TO LEARN THAT THE ELECTRONIC AVENUE\nTHROUGH WHICH I WAS LISTENING TO THE CHARLOTTE MECKLENBURG POLICE\nSCANNER HAS GONE DOWN. THEY'VE TAKEN THE FREQUENCY DOWN\nSO PEOPLE LIKE ME WON'T BE ABLE TO LISTEN TO IT.\nPRIOR TO THAT HAPPENING, I DID HEAR AN ANNOUNCEMENT THAT ALL\nTACTICAL CALLS, IE, WHEN TO FIRE FLASH-BANG GRENADES, PEPPER\nBALLS, AND WHEN TO ADVANCE WOULD COME FROM A SPECIFIC LIEUTENANT\nON THE FORCE TOMORROW, I'M GUESSING KIND OF THE ON-SCENE\nSHIFT COMMANDER. JIM, YOU THINK THIS KIND OF\nTHING WILL MOVE SLOWLY, BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO RAMP THE\nEXCITEMENT, THE ANGER LEVEL BACK UP?\n>> YEAH. THEY'VE DONE SUCH A GOOD JOB\nSINCE THE WHOLE NIGHT, REALLY, SINCE THE REPORT OF THIS\nSHOOTING, WHICH IS PERSONS IN CRITICAL CONDITION AND, YOU\nKNOW, WE SAW THE BEARCAT MOVE UP.\nWE SAW MORE OFFICERS DEPLOYED. THEY REALLY HANDLED THIS VERY\nMETHODICALLY. THEY'VE HAD A NUMBER OF OFFICERS\nINJURED. THEY'VE MADE SOME ARRESTS.\nBUT ANYONE WHO WATCHES THIS SEES A VERY PROFESSIONAL FORCE HERE\nLETTING DEMONSTRATORS DEMONSTRATE.\nCERTAINLY THEY'VE EMPLOYED SOME GAS, PEPPER BALLS, MAYBE SOME\nFLASH-BANGS BUT THESE ARE THE TOOLS THAT ARE USED TO DISBURSE\nCROWDS IN CITIES IN AMERICA TODAY.\nSO THE POLICE ARE LIMITED AS WELL.\nTHEY'RE NOT MAGICIANS. THEY HAVE CERTAIN TOOLS TO USE\nTO DISBURSZ THE CROWD. IF THEIR APPEARANCE AND FORCE\nDOESN'T DO IT, THEY HAVE TO GO TO THE TOOLS WE'VE DISCUSSED ALL\nEVENING, AND THAT'S TEAR GAS AND SMOKE AND SO.\nTHEY'VE USED THOSE THINGS. THEY'VE NOT OVERLY USED THEM.\nYOU DON'T SEE ANY IMAGES OF OFFICERS WILDLY STRIKING PEOPLE\nWITH BATONS AND JUST -- NO. THIS IS A VERY CONTROLLED\nPROFESSIONAL FORCE. IT'S UNDER TIGHT COMMAND.\nAS YOU POINT OUT, THE LIEUTENANT WILL BE ON THE ON-SCENE\nCOMMANDER MAKING THE DECISIONS, SO INDIVIDUAL UNITS OR OFFICERS\nAREN'T GOING TO START USING GAS OR PEPPER BALLS UNLESS THE\nCOMMANDERS DECIDE. THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.\nTHE THING YOU POINTED OUT EARLIER I THINK IS AS IMPORTANT\nAS WELL. THE CHARLOTTE OBSERVER WILL\nPROBABLY HAVE IT ALL IN THE MORNING.\nWHAT'S HAPPENED IN OTHER PRECINCTS IN THE CITY?\nHAS THERE BEEN SOME VIOLENCE ACTIVITY, LOOTING OR ANYTHING\nELSE? BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN SOME\nREPORTS OF THAT. THAT WILL PROBABLY COME TO LIGHT\nTOMORROW MORNING. HAS ANYBODY BEEN INJURED.\nBEFORE I FINISH, BRIAN, I'D JUST LIKE TO SAY WHAT A GREAT JOB\nTAMMY LIGHTNER AND GABE HAVE DONE.\nYACHT THINK THEY COULD HAVE GOTTEN ANY CLOSER.\nTHEY'RE RIGHT UP THERE. THEY'VE BEEN THERE ALL NIGHT,\nTHEY'VE BEEN GETTING GASSED. JUST SUPER REPORTING ALL\nEVENING. >> I'M DUTY BOUND AS HONORARY TV\nPARENTS TO SAY THAT THEY'VE NOT BEEN AS CAUTIOUS AS THEY SHOULD\nHAVE BEEN AT TIMES. BUT WE'VE BEEN THE RECIPIENTS OF\nTHEIR UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL REPORTING BOTH WHEN THEY'VE BEEN\nDOING THE TALKING AND WHEN OUR CAMERAS GOT IN WHEN WE HEARD\nFROM MANUEL WHO WE ASSUME HAS BEEN SWEPT UP, ABSORBED AS WE\nHEARD ITS PUT TONIGHT, ARRESTED AS THE POLICE LINE ADVANCED.\nJIM CAVANAUGH, OUR THANKS TO YOU AS WELL.\nDR. GOFF, WE MADE THE ECONOMIC POINT.\nYOU CORRECTLY RAISED FERGUSON, THAT KIND OF STRIP OF URBAN\nHIGHWAY CULTURE THAT WAS DOING POORLY ON A GOOD DAY, STRUGGLING\nBUSINESSES, MOM AND POP PLACES. HAIR SALONS, PACKAGE GOODS,\nCHECK CASHING. THAT BECAME, YOU KNOW, HIGHWAY 1\nIN VIETNAM LOCALIZED. THAT BECAME A WAR ZONE FOR THOSE\nDAYS OF PROTESTS. IT GOT CHEWED UP, BURNED UP.\nTHIS GREEMG DOWNTOWN CHARLOTTE, QUITE DIFFERENT AND A QUITE\nDIFFERENT POLICE STANCE. >> YEAH.\nIT HAS BEEN. I DO HAVE TO SAY, AGREEING WITH\nJIM, HEARING THAT THEY HAVE TAKEN COMMAND UP TO COMMAND\nSTAFF, THAT THE LIEUTENANT IS GOING TO BE THE ONE WHO'S GOING\nTO BE THE ARBITER OF WHEN FORCE IS USED, THAT IS THE SIGN OF A\nPROFESSIONAL POLICE DEPARTMENT. JIM, WHO HAS BEEN ON POINT ALL\nNIGHT IS SAYING WHAT YOU DON'T WANT IS THESE LAST PROTESTERS,\nTAMMY SAYING 57, A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER, BUT STILL, THE LAST OF\nTHEM WHO HAVE BEEN HERE AND HAVE OUTLASTED PEPPER SPRAY, PEPPER\nBALLS AND THE OTHER SETS OF THINGS THEY'VE BEEN SUBJECTED TO\nAND IT'S GETTING LATE IN THE EVENING, THEY MAY BE DECIDING TO\nTRY AND PROVOKE. YOU DON'T WANT AN INDIVIDUAL\nOFFICER WHO'S TIRED, WHO'S HAD A ROUGH DAY, WHOSE PROFESSION THEY\nFEEL LIKE IS UNDER SIEGE TO BE DECIDING, YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?\nIT'S TIME. IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO GO AHEAD\nAND MOVE OUT OF THE WAY. SO THAT MOMENT, HEARING THAT,\nHELPS ME FEEL LIKE WE STARTED WITH A GOOD NEWS STORY, RIGHT.\nI THINK WE CAN END THIS WITH A GOOD NEWS STORY AS WELL.\nI'M SEEING TAMMY THERE. >> YEAH.\nI ALSO WANT THE FOLKS WATCHING, THE FIREFIGHTERS, CHARLOTTE\nMECKLENBURG, FIRE ON THE SCANNER TONIGHT.\nTHEY'VE BEEN BUSY. THEY ARE DIFFERENT IN THAT\nPOLICE ARE OUTFITTED FOR THIS. FIREFIGHTERS ARE RESPONDING TO\nPUT OUT FIRES. THEY HAVE NO OFFENSIVE WEAPONS.\nTHEIR TRUCKS ARE NOT MEANT AS DEFENSIVE VEHICLES.\nTHEY'VE HAD TO ROLL THROUGH THIS AND AROUND THIS AND THEY HAVE\nDONE IT TONIGHT AS THEY DID LAST NIGHT.\nTHERE WERE PICTURES OF AN ENGINE COMPANY GOING RIGHT THROUGH THE\nHEART OF THE PROTESTS RESPONDING TO A CALL.\nTHEY HAVE, AS USUALLY, AN CALL LARGE AND PROFESSIONAL\nDEPARTMENT IN THIS AREA, 17th LARGEST CITY IN THE UNITED\nSTATES. TAMMY, CAN WE GET AN UPDATE FROM\nYOUR CAMERA LOCATION, WHAT YOU'RE SEEING?\n>> YEAH. BRIAN.\nSO THEY'RE AT A BIT OF A STAND STILL.\nTHEY HAVE NOT MOVED FORWARD IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MINUTES.\nTHERE IS I WOULD SAY MAYBE A HUNDRED RIOT POLICE OFFICERS\nLINED UP HERE. THE LINE GOES BACK A COUPLE\nDEEP. THERE'S PROBABLY STILL 75\nPROTESTERS OUT HERE ON EACH CORNER.\nONE THING I WANTED TO NOTE. YOU GUYS HAS MENTIONED EARLIER\nHOW PATIENT THESE POLICE OFFICERS HAVE BEEN.\nI'VE SEEN PEOPLE THROW THINGS AT THEM.\nI'VE SEEN THEM BLOW SMOKE IN THEIR FASHION.\nI'VE SEEN THEM YELL OBSCENITIES AT THEM AND THEY'VE STOOD THERE\nAND BEEN VERY PROFESSIONAL AND VERY RESPECTFUL WITH THE\nPROTESTERS. >> WE WATCHED FLOWER POTS BEING\nTOSSED AT THEM IN FRONT OF THE OMNI.\nWE WATCHED PIECES OF DEBRIS PICKED UP AND TOSSED AT THEM.\nLOOK. AS YOU REPORTED TONIGHT, TEMPERS\nHAVE BEEN HOT. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE COVERING\nTONIGHT IS A CROWD AGGRIEVED BECAUSE OF YET ANOTHER\nPOLICE-INVOLVED SHOOTING IN THIS COUNTRY.\nAND THE LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT SAYING, NO, WE NEED TO GET\nCONTROL OF THESE CITY STREETS. >> ABSOLUTELY.\nBRIAN, I WANT TO REMIND YOU, THIS STARTED AS A VIGIL AROUND\n6: 30 TONIGHT, ABOUT 12 BLOCKS FROM HERE.\nTHERE WERE ABOUT TWO OR 300 PEOPLE OUT THERE AND NOW, THIS\nIS WHAT IT'S TURNED INTO. WE'VE HAD POLICE OFFICERS\nINJURED. WE HAVE RIOT POLICE THAT HAVE\nBEEN OUT HERE FOR HOURS. AND THINGS HAVE ESCALATED.\nAS YOU CAN TELL, EVERYBODY HAS AN OPINION.\nPEOPLE ARE VERY PASSION AIT OUT HERE.\n>> TAMMY, THANK YOU. WE KEEP TALKING ABILITY IF OUR\nVIEWERS HAVE BEEN WITH US FOR A WHILE.\nMANUEL. THERE WAS THIS MOMENT WHERE\nTHANKS TO TAMMY AND HER CREW, TAMMY WAS ABLE TO WALK UP DURING\nA SILENT STANDOFF. MANUEL WAS A HANDFUL OF ONE OF\nTHE THE PROTESTERS STANDING INCHES OW H AWAY FROM POLICE IN\nRIOT GEAR. IT WAS PROBABLY AN HOUR AGO NOW\nAND MANUEL HAS BEEN SUBASSUMED BY THE ADVANCING LINE OF POLICE.\nBUT LET'S PLAY FOR YOU THE PASSION OF MANUEL AS HE WAS\nTALKING ABOUT THE KAZ TONIGHT TO THESE PEACEFUL PROTESTERS.\n>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE TONIGHT?\n>> WE'RE OUT HERE TO SEND A MESSAGE THAT WE WILL NOT ALLOW\nPEOPLE TO KEEP BEING KILLED BY POLICE OFFICERS.\nIT'S NOT GOING TO BE ALLOWED ANYMORE.\nTHERE HAS TO BE A SENSE OF ACCOUNTABILITY ON ALL SIDES.\nESPECIALLY FOR THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND ESPECIALLY WHEN\nTHERE'S PEOPLE BEING KILLED AND THERE'S NO ONE BEING HELD\nACCOUNTEDBLE FOR IT. >> MANUEL, I NOTICE YOU'VE BEEN\nSTANDING HERE ABOUT TWO FEET AWAY FROM THE RIOT OFFICERS WITH\nYOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK. WHAT MESSAGE ARE YOU SENDING?\n>> IT'S NOT ABOUT VIOLENCE. IT'S ABOUT STANDING AND NOT\nBACKING DOWN. THE MOMENT THEY SAY LEAVE, I'M\nNOT TAKING A STEP BACK. >> ARE YOU PREPARED TO GET\nARRESTED TONIGHT? THAT MAY BE WHAT HAPPENS.\n>> THAT WILL BE WHAT HAPPENS. IF SOMEONE DOES NOT STAND, WE\nARE GIVING GROUND. WE CANNOT GIVE GROUND.\nWE'RE NOT HERE FOR VIOLENCE BUT WE'RE HERE TO SEND A MESSAGE\nTHAT WE WILL NOT BE PUSHED BACK ANY LONGER.\nWE ARE HERE TOGETHER AND WE WILL STAND TOGETHER AND AS ONE WE\nWILL PERSEVERE. >> AND AS WE HEARD, SOMEONE SAID\nMANUEL WAS ABSORBED BY THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AS IT\nADVANCED. MANUEL ENDED UP BEING ONE OF\nTHREE LONE NOOELG PROTESTERS LINKED BY THEIR RAISED HANDS\nTOGETHER. WE HAVE EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE\nTHEY WERE GRABBED FAIRLY GENTLY, ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL, AND\nCUFFED AND ARRESTED, BUT YOU HEARD MANUEL FORTHRIGHTLY SAY HE\nWAS WILLING TO BE ARRESTED FOR THE CAUSE.\nNOT ALL THE PROTESTERS BROUGHT THE HEART AND MIND AND ATTITUDE\nTHAT MANUEL BROUGHT TO THIS TONIGHT, SOME RESORTED TO\nVIOLENCE. SOME HAVE RESORTED TO ABUSE OF\nTHE POLICE OFFICERS. THEY WERE FACING.\nYOU SEE THE GENTLEMAN THERE TAKING PART IN THE HANDS\nUP-DON'T SHOOT MOVEMENT. A COUPLE OF HEADLINES FOR THOSE\nJUST JOINING US AT 13 MINUTES AFTER THE START OF THIS NEW HOUR\nTONIGHT. WE HAVE AT LEAST ONE CIVILIAN IN\nCRITICAL CONDITION. WE LATER LEARNED TONIGHT AFTER\nREPORTING THERE HAD BEEN A FATALITY, THAT WAS LONG WRONG\nAND WE ARE PULLING FOR REPORTS THAT THIS CIVILIAN IS ALIVE.\nALL BEE IT ON LIFE SUPPORT. WE HAVE SEVERAL WOUNDED AND\nREASON TO BELIEF THAT ON BOTH SIDES, POLICE AND CIVILIAN,\nSEVERAL WOUNDED. WE HAVE ARRESTS PROBABLY\nSTARTING AT A DOZEN AND GOING MUCH HIGHER WHEN IT'S ALL\nCOUNTED UP AND WE'VE HAD DAMAGE TO MUNICIPAL AND PRIVATE\nPROPERTY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO STORES, HOTELS,\nAPARTMENT BUILDINGS, AND EVEN LANDSCAPING AND PUP AREAS IN\nFRONT OF THE OMNI. THE STATE HAS DECLARED A STATE\nOF EMERGENCY FOR THE CITY OF CHARLOTTE.\nTHAT'S GOING TO GIVE THESE STREETS A DIFFERENT LOOK,\nPROBABLY STARTING IN THE DARK TONIGHT BUT WHEN SUN COMES UP\nTOMORROW WE'RE GOING TO SEE THE CHARACTERISTICS LOOK WE SAW.\nWE'VE SEEN IT IN HURRICANE KATRINA, FERGUSON, THE NAFGS\nCOMES OUT. THEY COME OUT WITH VEHICLES.\nTHEY COME OUT WEARING CAMEO.

S&P 500 UP BY 13.5 POINTS.\nBOB, UTILITIES SPIKING ON THE BACK OF THIS, FINANCIALS A\nLITTLE BIT OF SELLING PRESSURE THERE.\n>> I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING IS THE FED DELIVERED ESSENTIALLY\nEXACTLY WHAT THE MARKET WAS POSITIONED FOR.\nWHAT WAS THE MARKET POSITIONED FOR?\nNO RATE HIKE, THEY GOT THAT. A SLIGHTLY MORE HAWKISH\nSTATEMENT, THE CASE FOR AN INCREASE IN THE FEDERAL FUNDS\nRATE HAS INCREASED. THERE IS YOUR SLIGHTLY MORE\nHAWKISH STATEMENT. BALANCE OF RISK ROUGHLY\nBALANCED, THEY SAID. THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE WAS\nANTICIPATING. AS MODEST UPGRADE TO THE\nECONOMIC OUTLOOK. LABOR MARKET HAS CONTINUED TO\nSTRENGTHEN AND GROWTH OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY PICKED UP FROM\nTHE MODEST PACING IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR.\nTHAT'S A MODEST UPGRADE TO THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK.\nTHIS IS WHAT EVERYONE WAS ANTICIPATING.\nYOU SAW MARKETS UP, BOND YIELDS MOVING DOWN A BIT.\nWE'RE UP 6, 7 POINTS FROM WHERE WE WERE, FOUR POINTS INTO THAT.\nLOOK AT THE KBE. AND HOPES OF AN INCREASE IN THE\nSTRENGTH OF THE YIELD CURVE. THEY WOULD GO UP.\nYOU SEE IT MOVING DOWN. OTHER INTEREST RATE SENSITIVE\nGROUPS THAT COMPETE AGAINST TREASURIES, FOR EXAMPLE, REAL\nESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS, FOR EXAMPLE, OR UTILITIES.\nTHOSE STOCKS MOVED UP A BIT. THERE IS THE NEW REAL ESTATE OF\nTHE 11th SECTOR FOR THE S&P 500. I GUESS THE ONE QUESTION THAT\nPEOPLE HAVE DOWN HERE AND MAYBE STEVE IS THERE, COULD ANSWER\nTHIS, ABOUT WHY THE TEN-YEAR YIELDS HAVE BEEN MOVING UP SO\nAGGRESSIVELY RECENTLY, MAYBE. AND IF STEVE IS NOT THERE, MAYBE\nONE OF THE PANELISTS CAN ANSWER, WHY WE MOVED UP 20 BASIS POINTS,\nMAYBE BECAUSE OF OTHER EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK OR THE BANK OF\nJAPAN LOWERING EXPECTATIONS OF MORE QUANTITATIVE EASING.\nBUT THAT'S BEEN A BIG DEBATE DOWN HERE.\nBACK TO YOU. >> ALL RIGHT, HEY, BOB, THANK\nYOU VERY MUCH. GO CHECK ON THE OTHER SIDE, RICK\nSANTELLI AND THE BOND MARKET IN CHICAGO.\n>> ANYBODY OUT THERE REALLY THINKS THEY'RE GOING TO RAISE IN\nNOVEMBER? COME ON.\nDOLLAR INDEX. THAT'S WHERE THE MOST VOLATILITY\nIS. IT WAS DOWN ABOUT 11, NOW DOWN\n41. THE TWO-YEAR, AND THE TEN-YEAR,\nEVERYBODY IS TALKING LIKE THEY MOVED A LOT.\nMAYBE IT IS THREE OR FOUR BASE POINTS, 81, NOW AT 76 ON 2s.\n170, 166 ON 10s. WE'RE HOVERING AT THE TOP OF THE\nREINS. THE NERVOUS NELLY COMPONENT\nBEFORE ANY MEETING. HAD A HANDFUL OF CLOSES OF THIS\nCYCLE ABOVE 170. THIS IS MORE MEAN REVERSION THAN\nIT IS A RESPONSE TO THE FED. DATA DEPENDENCE, SCOTT WAS\nSAYING DATA DEPENDENT. THE FED READS, REGARDING THE\nECONOMY, VERY JOLLY BUT THE NUMBERS IN THE PITS.\nDOESN'T ADD UP TO BE DATA DEPENDENT AND IN TERMS OF THE\nDOTS, THEY HAD SOME OF THESE ISSUES REGARDING FED FUNDS,\nWHAT, 2 1/2, 3, 3 1/2 PERCENT. SO SMASHING THE DOTS IS TRYING\nTO COME TO A REALITY BECAUSE THE SCENE OF THE FUTURE IS A CLOUDY\nCRYSTAL BALL AT BEST. EVERYBODY AGREES THEY CAN ALWAYS\nFIGHT INFLATION LATER. LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.\nTHEY'RE COMPLETELY FLEXIBLE ON COMING UP WITH ANY EXCUSE NOT TO\nRAISE RATES. BUT THEY'RE INFLEXIBLE ON ANY NEW MEDICINE.\nIT IS ALL ABOUT DATA. IF WE HAD THREE MORE TENTHS OF\nINFLATION, WE COULD RAISE AND EVERYTHING WOULD BE HUNKY-DORY.\nFANTASY STATEMENT, CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR THE PRESS CONFERENCE.\nBACK TO YOU. >> THANK YOU, RICK SANTELLI.\n>> HOW DOES HE REALLY FEEL? >> I WONDER.\n>> HARD TO ARGUE WITH THAT. >> YOU AGREE WITH HIM?\n>> A LOT OF WHAT HE SAYS IS TRUE.\nTHE FED, THE DOTS HAVE BEEN A JOKE.\nTHE FED, YOU KNOW, HAS CLEARLY HAS AN EASY BIAS TO IT.\nAND THE DOVES WILL COME UP WITH ANY REASON TO TRY TO KEEP, YOU\nKNOW, RATES WHERE THEY'RE AT AND, YOU KNOW, AND THE DATA\nDEPENDENCY GIVES THEM THE ULTIMATE OUT AT EVERY MEETING.\n>> I THINK WE SHOULD SEND RICK OFF TO WASHINGTON FOR THE PRESS\nCONFERENCE. THAT WOULD SET OFF SOME\nFIREWORKS. >> I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT.\n>> DIFFERENT QUESTIONS. >> MAYBE NEXT TIME.\n>> ON THE WORD OF JACK NICHOLSON, I DON'T THINK THEY\nCOULD HANDLE SANTELLI. >> THANKS, RICK.\nRICK SANTELLI, THE ONE AND ONLY. THAT DECISION NOW OUT OF THE\nWAY. WE'RE CLOSE TO SESSION HIGHS\nHERE WITH THE S&P UP BY 10 POINTS.\nCOUNTING DOWN TO JANET YELLEN'S NEWS CONFERENCE AT THE BOTTOM OF\nTHE HOUR.

IS THAT BACK ON?\n>> NO, I THINK THE OVERALL EQUITY MARKET WILL BE SUPPORTED.\nRATES WILL HAVE A HARD TIME FALLING MUCH FROM HERE GIVEN THE\nSTRENGTH OF THE ECONOMY AND GIVEN CORE INFLATION IS RISING\nHERE. BUT WITH REGARD TO STOCKS\nOVERALL, I MEAN, IT IS NOT A PRETTY HOUSE NOW.\nBUT IT IS THE PRETTIEST HOUSE IN A BOMBED OUT NEIGHBORHOOD.\nTHERE IS NO YIELD ON CASH AND YIELD ON BONDS AROUND THE\nDEVELOPED WORLD ARE SO LOW THAT THAT IS GOING TO FUNNEL MONEY\nTOWARDS THE EQUITY MARKET. I WOULD BE OVER EQUITIES IN THE\nDEVELOPED WORLD NOW, EVEN THOUGH I THINK I WOULD RATHER GO WITH\nCYCLICALS RATHER THAN DEFENSES NOW.\n>> TO YOUR POINT, IN A WORLD WHERE BOND MARKETS ARE BEING\nJURY RIGGED BY CENTRAL BANKS, CAN WE SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE\nFUTURE OF BOND YIELDS? IT IS, YOU KNOW, IT IS VERY HARD\nFOR ME TO GET BEARISH ON BONDS WHEN WE HAVE JAPAN AND HAD THAT\nTRANSLATES INTO DIVIDEND PAYING STOCKS, RIGHT?\n>> THERE HAS BEEN UNUSUAL BEHAVIOR IN THE MARKETS OF LATE\nWHEN STOCKS ARE GOING DOWN AND BOND YIELDS ARE GOING UP AT THE\nSAME TIME, BOTH MARKETS HAVE BEEN THROWING UP IN TANDEM WHEN\nTHAT HAPPENS. IT IS --\n>> CAN WE QUICKLY THROW UP BEST TEAM IN THE BUSINESS, BY THE\nWAY, THANKS FOR ROLLING ON THE FLY.\nCAN WE THROW UP THE GDX, GOLD MINER.\nI WANT TO ASK YOU, I KNOW YOU HAVE LIKED GOLD IN THE PAST.\nTHE GDX IS SPIKING. LOOK AT THE CHART.\nHARD TO SEE ON THE SIDE FROM THE RADIO, THE GDX UP 5%.\nIT TOOK OFF WHEN THE FED DECISION -- 6% NOW.\nTHANK YOU, PAUL, PRODUCER. ARE YOU STILL A BUYER OF GOLD\nAND GOLD MINERS? >> GOLD AND GOLD MINERS FOR THE\nLONG-TERM PLAY, BRIAN. WE KNOW WHERE THE STORY ENDS AT\nTHE END OF THE DAY. >> WHERE IS THAT?\nIT IS A CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE AND, LIKE, MY\nCHARACTER JUST DIED. >> INFLATION IS THE ANSWER?\n>> LOOK, YOU KNOW, YOU LOOK AT REINHART AND ROGOFF'S WORK,\nGOVERNMENTS THAT GET THEMSELVES HEAVILY INDEBTED DO ONE OF THREE\nTHINGS, DEFAULT, RESTRUCTURE OR --\n>> SO YOU BUYING GOLD IS A BUNKER TRADE?\nBOTTOM LINE? >> ULTIMATE SAFE.\n>> IT IS A SAFE TRADE. >> STEVE, YOU'VE SEEN BOND\nYIELDS ACROSS THE CURVE GO DOWN. PRETTY SHARPLY.\nTEN-YEAR, 1.66 NOW, IT WAS 1.7ISH.\n>> I THINK THERE WAS SOMETHING BAKING IN A LITTLE BIT, THOSE\nWHO WERE THINKING IT COULD BE A SURPRISE THERE.\nI WAS GOING TO SAY FOR NEXT MONTH OR SO, PUT YOUR SEAT BELT\nON. THIS A RECIPE FOR VOLATILITY.\nWHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE IS A LOT OF COMMENTARY THAT WILL BE ALL\nOVER THE MAP, THE CHAIR DOES NOT HAVE A CONSENSUS ON HER\nCOMMITTEE ABOUT POLICY. AND THERE IS GOING TO BE GUYS\nOUT THERE THAT WILL BE SPEAKING. AND THEY'LL BE MOVING THE\nMARKETS AND THE DATA WILL BE COMING IN IN THE NEXT MONTH OR\nSO. IF IT IS STRONG, I THINK\nNOVEMBER REMAINS A POSSIBILITY. IT IS -- THE FED WOULD HAVE TO\nHIDE BEHIND POLITICAL CURTAIN THERE TO SAY WE ARE NOT RAISING\nBECAUSE OF THE ELECTION. AND THINK I THINK THEY WOULD BE\nAT PAINS TO SAY THEY DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.\nI THINK WHAT THEY WANT TO DO HERE IS YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT\nA RATE HIKE AS SOON AS NOVEMBER, LIKELY IN DECEMBER.\n>> I KNOW YOU GOT TO GET IN QUICKLY.\nDON'T WANT TO GIVE IT AWAY. CAN YOU GIVE US A HINT WHAT YOU\nWILL ASK CHAIR YELLEN? >> WELL, THERE IS THIS\nPARTICULAR PARAGRAPH THAT SAYS BUT DECIDED TO WAIT FOR THE TIME\nBEING FOR FURTHER EVIDENCE. I DON'T -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT\nTHAT FURTHER EVIDENCE WOULD BE, A NATURAL QUESTION, I WOULD\nTHINK, NO? >> GREAT QUESTION.\nSTEVE, THANK YOU. >> AND WHAT IS ON OR OFF PRESS\nCONFERENCES. >> THEY COULD ANNOUNCE AT PRESS\nCONFERENCE IN NOVEMBER TODAY. >> I WON'T ASK.\nTHEY ANSWERED THAT ALREADY. >> LEAVE IT THERE.\nTHANKS SO MUCH TO ALL OF OUR PANEL HERE.\nWE ARE AT SESSION HIGHS RIGHT NOW.\nS&P 500 UP BY 13.5 POINTS. BOB, UTILITIES SPIKING ON THE\nBACK OF THIS, FINANCIALS A LITTLE BIT OF SELLING PRESSURE\nTHERE. >> I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING\nIS THE FED DELIVERED ESSENTIALLY EXACTLY WHAT THE MARKET WAS\nPOSITIONED FOR. WHAT WAS THE MARKET POSITIONED\nFOR? NO RATE HIKE, THEY GOT THAT.\nA SLIGHTLY MORE HAWKISH STATEMENT, THE CASE FOR AN\nINCREASE IN THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE HAS INCREASED.\nTHERE IS YOUR SLIGHTLY MORE HAWKISH STATEMENT.\nBALANCE OF RISK ROUGHLY BALANCED, THEY SAID.\nTHAT'S WHAT EVERYONE WAS ANTICIPATING.\nAS MODEST UPGRADE TO THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK.\nLABOR MARKET HAS CONTINUED TO STRENGTHEN AND GROWTH OF\nECONOMIC ACTIVITY PICKED UP FROM THE MODEST PACING IN THE FIRST\nHALF OF THE YEAR. THAT'S A MODEST UPGRADE TO THE\nECONOMIC OUTLOOK. THIS IS WHAT EVERYONE WAS\nANTICIPATING. YOU SAW MARKETS UP, BOND YIELDS\nMOVING DOWN A BIT. WE'RE UP 6, 7 POINTS FROM WHERE\nWE WERE, FOUR POINTS INTO THAT. LOOK AT THE KBE.\nAND HOPES OF AN INCREASE IN THE STRENGTH OF THE YIELD CURVE.\nTHEY WOULD GO UP. YOU SEE IT MOVING DOWN.\nOTHER INTEREST RATE SENSITIVE GROUPS THAT COMPETE AGAINST\nTREASURIES, FOR EXAMPLE, REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS, FOR\nEXAMPLE, OR UTILITIES. THOSE STOCKS MOVED UP A BIT.\nTHERE IS THE NEW REAL ESTATE OF THE 11th SECTOR FOR THE S&P 500.\nI GUESS THE ONE QUESTION THAT PEOPLE HAVE DOWN HERE AND MAYBE\nSTEVE IS THERE, COULD ANSWER THIS, ABOUT WHY THE TEN-YEAR\nYIELDS HAVE BEEN MOVING UP SO AGGRESSIVELY RECENTLY, MAYBE.\nAND IF STEVE IS NOT THERE, MAYBE ONE OF THE PANELISTS CAN ANSWER,\nWHY WE MOVED UP 20 BASIS POINTS, MAYBE BECAUSE OF OTHER EUROPEAN\nCENTRAL BANK OR THE BANK OF JAPAN LOWERING EXPECTATIONS OF\nMORE QUANTITATIVE EASING. BUT THAT'S BEEN A BIG DEBATE\nDOWN HERE. BACK TO YOU.\n>> ALL RIGHT, HEY, BOB, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nGO CHECK ON THE OTHER SIDE, RICK SANTELLI AND THE BOND MARKET IN\nCHICAGO. >> ANYBODY OUT THERE REALLY\nTHINKS THEY'RE GOING TO RAISE IN NOVEMBER?\nCOME ON. DOLLAR INDEX.\nTHAT'S WHERE THE MOST VOLATILITY IS.\nIT WAS DOWN ABOUT 11, NOW DOWN 41.\nTHE TWO-YEAR, AND THE TEN-YEAR, EVERYBODY IS TALKING LIKE THEY\nMOVED A LOT. MAYBE IT IS THREE OR FOUR BASE\nPOINTS, 81, NOW AT 76 ON 2s. 170, 166 ON 10s.\nWE'RE HOVERING AT THE TOP OF THE REINS.\nTHE NERVOUS NELLY COMPONENT BEFORE ANY MEETING.\nHAD A HANDFUL OF CLOSES OF THIS CYCLE ABOVE 170.\nTHIS IS MORE MEAN REVERSION THAN IT IS A RESPONSE TO THE FED.\nDATA DEPENDENCE, SCOTT WAS SAYING DATA DEPENDENT.\nTHE FED READS, REGARDING THE ECONOMY, VERY JOLLY BUT THE\nNUMBERS IN THE PITS. DOESN'T ADD UP TO BE DATA\nDEPENDENT AND IN TERMS OF THE DOTS, THEY HAD SOME OF THESE\nISSUES REGARDING FED FUNDS, WHAT, 2 1/2, 3, 3 1/2 PERCENT.\nSO SMASHING THE DOTS IS TRYING TO COME TO A REALITY BECAUSE THE\nSCENE OF THE FUTURE IS A CLOUDY CRYSTAL BALL AT BEST.\nEVERYBODY AGREES THEY CAN ALWAYS FIGHT INFLATION LATER.\nLET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. THEY'RE COMPLETELY FLEXIBLE ON\nCOMING UP WITH ANY EXCUSE NOT TO RAISE RATES.\nBUT THEY'RE INFLEXIBLE ON ANY  IT IS ALL ABOUT DATA.\nIF WE HAD THREE MORE TENTHS OF INFLATION, WE COULD RAISE AND\nEVERYTHING WOULD BE HUNKY-DORY. FANTASY STATEMENT, CAN'T WAIT TO\nHEAR THE PRESS CONFERENCE. BACK TO YOU.\n>> THANK YOU, RICK SANTELLI. >> HOW DOES HE REALLY FEEL?\n>> I WONDER. >> HARD TO ARGUE WITH THAT.\n>> YOU AGREE WITH HIM? >> A LOT OF WHAT HE SAYS IS\nTRUE. THE FED, THE DOTS HAVE BEEN A\nJOKE. THE FED, YOU KNOW, HAS CLEARLY\nHAS AN EASY BIAS TO IT. AND THE DOVES WILL COME UP WITH\nANY REASON TO TRY TO KEEP, YOU KNOW, RATES WHERE THEY'RE AT\nAND, YOU KNOW, AND THE DATA DEPENDENCY GIVES THEM THE\nULTIMATE OUT AT EVERY MEETING. >> I THINK WE SHOULD SEND RICK\nOFF TO WASHINGTON FOR THE PRESS CONFERENCE.\nTHAT WOULD SET OFF SOME FIREWORKS.\n>> I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT. >> DIFFERENT QUESTIONS.\n>> MAYBE NEXT TIME. >> ON THE WORD OF JACK\nNICHOLSON, I DON'T THINK THEY COULD HANDLE SANTELLI.\n>> THANKS, RICK. RICK SANTELLI, THE ONE AND ONLY.\nTHAT DECISION NOW OUT OF THE WAY.\nWE'RE CLOSE TO SESSION HIGHS HERE WITH THE S&P UP BY 10\nPOINTS. COUNTING DOWN TO JANET YELLEN'S\nNEWS CONFERENCE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HOUR.\nBILL GROSS JOINS US NEXT.",

THAT'S THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH\nTHE FED. THEY'RE USING COMMUNICATION AS A\nPOLICY TOOL AND THERE'S NOT A CONCERTED EFFORT TO GO INTO THE\nSAME DIRECTION. CLEARLY OVER THE NEXT THREE\nMONTHS, EVERY TIME THERE'S A MEETING, WE'LL TRY TO FIGURE OUT\nWHAT SIGNAL IS BEING SENT AND THE CREDIBILITY ISSUE AS WELL.\nJACKSON HOLE, JANET YELLEN WALKED THE FINE LINE.\nSTANLEY FISCHER SAID TWO RATE HIKES BEFORE THE END OF THE\nYEAR.

MORE COMMUNICATION OR LESS.\nI WOULD LEAN TOWARDS LESS AND ACTION.\n>> I WOULD DO YOU THINK THEY DIDN'T HIKE?\nWHY WEREN'T MORE ON THE SIDE OF THE THREE DISSENTERS?\n>> THIS IS SOMETHING THEY TALKED ABOUT, THE ASYMMETRIC IMPACT OF\nWHAT THEY DO. THERE ARE MORE DANGERS IN MOVING\nTOO SON THAN STAYING TOO LONG. THEY THINK IF THEY MOVE TOO SOON\nTHEY COULD TIGHTEN MARKETS. I DISAGREE.\nI THINK IF YOU HIKE RATES, IT SHOWS A DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE IN\nTHE U.S. ECONOMY. ONE THING I'M GLAD ABOUT IS THAT\nTHEY DIDN'T REFER TOO MUCH TO THE WEAKENING OF THE DATA WE SAW\nIN AUGUST. IT WAS AUGUST.\nYOU DO TEND TO SEE WEAKER DATA IN AUGUST.\nI WAS DISAPPOINTED ABOUT THEIR MEDIUM TO LONG-TERM PROJECTIONS\nCOMING DOWN. >> WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE U.S.\nEQUITY MARKETS NOW, TALKING ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY, TOO, DO\nYOU THINK THERE'S ENOUGH MOMENTUM TO CONTINUE TO PUSH\nTHEM HIGHER AND LET'S ADD THE DOLLAR INTO THAT BAG, TOO.\nARE WE GOING TO CONTINUE TO SEE MOMENTUM HERE?\n>> I THINK SO. A QUESTION I WAS GETTING IN\nAUGUST FROM CLIENTS IS ABOUT THE BEAR MARKET.\nWILL WE MOVE INTO BEAR MARKET TERRITORY?\nI DON'T THINK SO. WE'VE GOT THE LEADING ECONOMIC\nINDICATORS TODAY, WHICH ARE TEN DIFFERENT INDICATORS WHICH SHOW\nTHE ECONOMY IS CONTINUING TO POWER UP.\nAND EARNINGS HOPEFULLY WILL BREAK THAT SIX QUARTERS OF\nNEGATIVE EARNINGS WE'VE SEEN. MAYBE NOT QUITE IN THIS QUARTER\nBUT POSSIBLY IN THE NEXT. THAT COULD OFFER ANOTHER\nTAILWIND TO THE STOCK MARKET. >> HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT BONDS?\nFITCH SAYING THE GLOBAL UNIVERSE OF NEGATIVE YIELDING SOVEREIGN\nDEBT FELL TO ONLY $10.9 TRILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 12.\nLEADS FOR LONGER, DATA DEBT HAVE BEEN PICKING UP BECAUSE OF THE\nSTEEPENING OF THE YIELD CURVE. PEOPLE SAY THAT MIGHT BE A\nHARBINGER OF THE BOND BUBBLE BURSTING.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK? >> WE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO BE AT\nTHE LONGER END, AND THERE ARE OTHER ASSET CLASSES WHERE IT'S\nEASIER TO MAKE MONEY. >> WHAT ABOUT CREDIT?\n>> CREDIT, AGAIN, WITH THE QUESTION ABOUT THE FED MOVING\nSTILL OPEN, CREDIT IS STILL QUESTIONABLE AS WELL.\nI WOULD STICK WITH THE STOCKS AT THE MOMENT.\n>> ARE YOU SURE? ON THE OTHER HAND WE SEE WAGES\nRISING IN THE U.S., THAT MEANS PROFIT MARGINS WILL BE\nDEPRESSED. IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT\nPICTURE IN EUROPE, BECAUSE WAGES ARE NOT RISING BY AS MUCH.\n>> THEY ARE RISING FROM A LOW BASE AND THEN DEMAND RAISING AS\nWELL. CONSUMER SPENDING WAS WEAK FOR\nAUGUST AND JULY. BUT THAT WAS A TEMPORARY BLIP.\nAS DEMAND PICKS UP, AS YOU SEE COSTS START TO RISE, COMPANIES\nWILL BE ABLE TO MAKE THEM. >> YOU REFERENCED THE GENERAL\nFROTH STORY, WHEN YOU TALK TO CLIENTS AT THE MOMENT, IT DOES\nSEEM FUND MANAGERS ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE DO WE GET THE\nBEST AMOUNT OF YIELD AT THE MOMENT?\nWILL WE CONTINUE TO SEE THIS MONEY PILING INTO THE BOND\nMARKET? WHAT ARE YOUR CLIENTS SAYING?\nWHAT'S THE GENERAL MOOD? ARE THEY WANTING TO INVEST?\nARE THEY SITTING TIRED OR ON CASH?\n>> WE REPRESENT INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS AND WE HEAR I'M\nWAITING. WE KEEP ASKING WHAT ARE YOU\nWAITING FOR? AND A NEW TERM I LEARNED IS\nT.I.N.A., THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE.\nI WOULD FIND IT HARD FROM A RISK/REWARD PROFILE TO FIND\nANOTHER ALTERNATIVE TO U.S. STOCKS RIGHT NOW.\nFROM A RISK/REWARD PROFILE I THINK U.S. STOCKS IS A PLACE TO\nBE. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\n>> THANK YOU.",

PEOPLE SAYING IT'S NOT JUST SO\nSIMPLE, HAWKISH VERSUS DOVISH, ALL SORTS OF INTELLECTUAL\nDISAGREEMENTS. >> I THINK THAT'S GOOD.\nJANET YELLEN ADDRESSED THAT, SHE SAID WE DON'T WANT EVERYBODY ON\nTHE SAME PAGE. THE THREE DISSENTS CAME FROM\nTHREE FED PRESIDENTS, NOT GOVERNORS OF THE FED.\nTHE GOVERNORS ARE MORE CLOSELY IN HER CIRCLE.\nTHAT WOULD BE A BIGGER DEAL AND REAL SIGN THAT THERE IS\nDISAGREEMENT. WE KNEW THE REGIONAL FED\nPRESIDENTS WOULD DISAGREE. THAT'S WHY THE MARKETS WERE SO\nCONFUSED IN THE COMMENTARY IN THE LEAD-UP.\n>> ALL SECTORS WERE UP, CONSUMER STAPLES AND BANKS WERE THE\nLAGGARDS BUT STILL IN POSITIVE TERRITORY.\nIT WAS APPLAUDED BY MARKETS, BUT NOT TOO POSITIVELY.\nLET'S LOOK AT TODAY'S OTHER TOP STORY.\nWE'VE HAD A SECOND NIGHT OF VIOLENT PROTESTS IN CHARLOTTE,\nNORTH CAROLINA FOLLOWING THE FATAL POLICE SHOOTING OF A BLACK\nMAN ON TUESDAY. POLICE FIRING TEAR GAS AT\nDEMONSTRATORS. ONE PERSON IS IN CRITICAL\nCONDITION AFTER BEING SHOT BY ANOTHER CIVILIAN.\nNORTH CAROLINA'S GOVERNOR DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY.\nWE'LL HAVE A LIVE REPORT FROM CHARLOTTE IN A BIT.\n>> LET'S CHECK IN ON THE GLOBAL MARKETS.\nAS FOR THE EUROPEAN MARKETS, THE EUROPEAN EQUITY TRADE JUST\nGETTING GOING HERE. LOOKING POSITIVE.\nENERGY PRODUCERS AND MATERIALS ARE LEADING GAINS IN EUROPE TOAD\nON THE BACK OF HIGHER OIL PRICES.\nTHE GERMAN DAX UP 1.3%. THE FTSE 100 IN THE UK IS\nLAGGING ON THE SECOND THE ONLY ONE OF THE GROUP NOT UP MORE\nTHAN 1%. IT HAS BEEN OUTPERFORMING SO FAR\nLATELY. ITALY AND SPAIN BOTH HIGHER BY\nMORE THAN 1%. JAPANESE MARKETS IN ASIA WERE\nCLOSED FOR THE AUTUMNAL EQUINOX HOLIDAY.\n>> YOU CAN SAY IT. >> MAYBE IN JAPAN THAT'S WHAT IT\nIS CALLED. THEY'VE BEEN CELEBRATING AUTUMN\nA LOT LATELIMENT. >> THEY HAVE A LOT OF AUTUMN\nDAYS OFF. >> WHY DON'T WE HAVE A FALL DAY\nOFF? >> WE HAVE THANKSGIVING.\nYOUR FIRST THANKSGIVING. WE SEE GAINS ACROSS THE BOARD\nAFTER THE FED STAYED ON HOLD. THAT EASES SOME PRESSURE FOR\nEMERGING MARKETS, EVEN IF IT'S IN THE NEAR-TERM.\nWE'RE SEEING CURRENCIES RALLY. >> WHEN IT COMES TO THANKSGIVING\nIN A WORK CONTEXT, WHAT WILL YOU BE MOST THANKFUL FOR?\n>> YOU AND MY 3:00 A.M. WAKEUP. >> DON'T SOUR IT.\nJUST FOR ME. PERFECT, LIKEWISE.\nLET'S LOOK AT BROADER MARKETS QUICKLY.\nOIL PRICES STRONG YESTERDAY UP AGAIN TODAY.\nOF COURSE THE DOLLAR SOFTENING IN REGARDS TO THE FED DECISION\nHAS HELPED ALL COMMODITIES INCLUDING OIL PRICES.\nTHE DOLLAR DID SLIP A HALF PERCENT YESTERDAY AGAINST A\nBROAD BAKET OF CURRENCIES. OIL PRICES TODAY, 45.8 FOR WTI.\nUP THE BEST PART OF 1%. THE DOLLAR, LET'S LOOK AT THAT.\nBROADER INDEX DOWN ABOUT A HALF PERCENT.\nA BIT MORE MOVEMENT TODAY IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.\nTHE DOLLAR BOUNCING BACK AGAINST THE YEN.\nUP A HALF PERCENT. IT IS, THOUGH, HOWEVER A LITTLE\nWEAKER AGAINST THE EURO AND THE POUND.\nSO, SOME MORE CONFUSING MOVEMENT THERE.\n>> DOLLAR/YEN HAS BEEN ALL OVER THE PLACE.\n1% MOVES IN BOTH DIRECTIONS AFTER THE BOJ WENT INTO\nCONFUSING UNCHARTED TERRITORY, BEGGING THE YIELD CURVE.\nWE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. A LOT OF COMMENTARY OVERNIGHT\nTHINKS IT'S CREATIVE AT LEAST THAT THEY'RE GETTING AWAY FROM\nTRADITIONAL POLICY LEVERS WHICH HAS NOT SEEMED TO WORK, BUT THEY\nNEED FISCAL POLICY, STRUCTURAL CHANGES, IS ANYTHING GOING TO\nWORK? >> THE RESPONSE BY MARKETS HAS\nBEEN BETTER THAN SOME OTHERS. YOU REMEMBER THE TEMPER TANTRUM\nWHEN THE FED TRIED TO FINESSE THINGS, THE MARKETS DIDN'T\nWELCOME THAT. STILL NEED TO SEE IF THIS FEEDS\nTHROUGH TO THE ACTUAL ECONOMY IN JAPAN.\nA LOOK AT OIL PRICES WHICH HAVE PERFORMED WELL IN RECENT DAYS.\n>> LET'S FOCUS IN ON THE TOP STORY.\nTHE FED DECISION. JANET YELLEN TELLING THE MARKET\nSHE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE A RATE HIKE THIS YEAR EVEN THOUGH THEY\nPAUSED IN YESTERDAY'S MEETING. OUR SENIOR ECONOMICS REPORTER,\nSTEVE LIESMAN JOINS US WITH HIS VIEW.\nYOU HAD A CHANCE TO DIGEST EVERYTHING.\n>> WILL YOU WRITE DOWN THE BIG NUMBERS OF 3, 2, 1 1/2.\n>> HE'S WRITING IT. >> I'LL ASK YOU WHAT THOSE THREE\nNUMBERS REPRESENT. HERE'S WHAT THE FED DID, THEY\nGAVE A GENERALLY UPBEAT VIEW ON THE ECONOMY SAYING JOB GAINS\nWERE SOLID, HOUSEHOLD SPENDING GROWING STRONGLY.\nTHE CASE HAD GROWN STRONGER FOR A RATE HIKE BUT HELD OFF ON\nRAIDING RATES FOR THE TIME BEING.\n>> MOST OF US JUDGE THAT THE CASE FOR AN IMMEDIATE INCREASE\nIN THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE IS STRONGER BUT THAT IT WOULD BE\nSENSIBLE GIVEN THE FINDING OF A BIT MORE RUNNING ROOM TO WAIT TO\nSEE SOME CONTINUED PROGRESS, EVIDENCE THAT WE CONTINUE TO\nPROGRESS TOWARDS OUR OBJECTIVES. SO, FOR THE TIME BEING, WE ARE\nGOING TO WATCH INCOMING EVIDENCE AND YOU CAN SEE FROM THE S&P\nTHAT MOST PARTICIPANTS DO EXPECT THAT ONE INCREASE IN THE FEDERAL\nFUNDS RATE WILL BE APPROPRIATE THIS YEAR.\n>> THE FED'S CASE WITH ROOM TO RUN COMES FROM THIS CHART IT\nSHOWS JOB GROWTH HAS BEEN STRONG OVER THE PAST YEAR, ALMOST\nDOUBLE WHAT THE FED THINKS IS NEEDED TO BRING DOWN THE\nUNEMPLOYMENT RATE. BUT THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS\nBARELY MOVED, HOVERING AROUND 4.9%.\nTHIS HAPPENED BECAUSE 2.4 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE COME BACK TO\nTHE WORK FORCE IN THE PAST YEAR. SOME COMING YOU A THE SIDELINES\nWHO HAVE DROPPED OUT. THE FED WANTS TO SEE HOW FAR\nTHIS PROCESS CAN RUN. JOB GAIN WITH NO TIGHTENING IN\nTHE JOB MARKET. SO THAT COULD MEAN A RATE HIKE\nIN DECEMBER. BUT MAYBE NOT.\nNOW BACK TO THE THREE NUMBERS, DID YOU FIGURE IT OUT?\n>> THE NUMBER OF HIKES FROM LAST YEAR HAS BEEN FALLING?\n>> NO. THEY ARE THE BENCHMARK RATES OF\nTHE FOLLOWING CENTRAL BANKS, THE PHILIPPINES AT 3%, NEW ZEALAND\nAT 2, AUSTRALIA AT 1.5. ALL THREE BANKS STOOD FIRM IN\nTHE WAKE OF THE FED'S DECISION. >> NORWAY THIS MORNING ALSO\nSTOOD PAT. >> I DON'T KNOW NORWAY'S\nBENCHMARK RATE, DO YOU? >> IT'S HIGHER.\n>> I KNOW THEY DIDN'T CHANGE IT TODAY.\n>> THAT'S A BONUS QUESTION I DIDN'T HAVE ON THE SYLLABUS.\n>> THERE YOU GO. >> THE FED IS NOT IN A VACUUM,\nEVERYBODY IS LOOKING TO THEM. >> REACTING.\n>> THEY'RE REACTING. IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE IN A POST QE\nWORLD. I'M NOT SURE WHAT THAT IS.\nTHEY'RE STILL BEING EASY BUT WANT TO TRANSITION NO SOMETHING\nNORMAL. IF YOU'RE A LONG-TERM INVESTOR\nGLOBALLY HOW DO YOU NAVIGATE THESE WATERS?\n>> I THINK IT'S WORTH WHILE LOOKING AT WHAT WAS THOUGHT TO\nBE THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION. THE OUTLOOK HAS COME DOWN\nSUBSTANTIALLY A QUARTER POINT FOR '16, 50 BASIS POINTS FOR\n'17. 50 FOR '18.\nTHAT ORANGE LINE NOW WHERE THE FED IS IS WHERE THE CNBC FED\nSURVEY WAS. THE FED HAS FOLLOWED THE MARKET\nLOWER. I THINK YOU CAN RELY ON BANKS\nBEING LOW AND RISING GRADUALLY OVER THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS.\nANOTHER GREAT QUESTION AT THE FED YESTERDAY, OTHER THAN MINE,\nHOW DO YOU HAVE RATES GOING UP SO MUCH WHEN YOU HAVE GROWTH\nCOMING DOWN SO MUCH. EVEN THAT NEW LOWER CHART MAY\nNOT BE ACCURATE AS TO WHERE IT IS.\nIT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF THE MARKET STEPS DOWN AGAIN AND\nDECIDES IF THE FED IS HERE, I'M GOING TO BE HERE AGAIN.\n>> THE OTHER THING THAT CHART SAYS IS THE ONLY PLACE TO WATCH\nPREVIEW AND ANALYSIS OF THE FED IS CNBC.\n>> GREAT POINT, WILLFRED. EXCELLENT POINT.\n>> I WAS READING PAUL DONOVAN'S ANALYSIS, HE SAID THE MOST\nINTERESTING THING WAS THE DEPTH OF DIVISION.\nAND AS WE LOOK AHEAD TO 2017, I HARDER TO PREDICT HOW THEY'LL\nACT IN EACH MEETING. AND WE SHOULD TRY TO STEP BACK\nFROM IT ALL. IT'S VERY UNCLEAR HOW THEY'RE\nALL MAKING THEIR INDIVIDUAL MINDS UP NOW.\n>> I'M NOT SURE THAT'S RIGHT. SOMETIMES DISSENT LEADS YOU\nASTRAY. SOMETIMES DISSENT LEADS THE WAY.\nIT'S POSSIBLE IN THIS CASE THAT DISSENT IS LEADING THE WAY.\nMAYBE THEY DIDN'T GET ENOUGH IN THE STATEMENT.\nBUT WHAT THAT MEANS AND TELLS YOU IS THE NEXT MOVE IS GOING TO\nBE A RATE HIKE. TWO DIFFERENT METRICS HERE.\nIT'S BEEN SINCE 2014 THAT WE HAD THREE DISSENTS.\nI READ SOMEPLACE ELSE, I HAVEN'T CHECKED THIS, IT'S BEEN FIVE\nYEARS SENSE WE HAD THREE HAWKISH DISSENTS.\nIT'S BEEN QUITE AWHILE. THE DISSENT IN 2014 WAS LAKOTA\nDISSENTING IN A DOVISH WAY AND FISHER FROM DALLAS AND PLUSSER\nFROM PHILADELPHIA DISSENTING IN A HAWKISH WAY.\nMY CONSENSUS IS MOVING TOWARDS A RATE HIKE, BUT WE HAVE TO FIGURE\nOUT THIS NEW METRIC ROOM TO RUN. HOW DO YOU MEASURE IF WE CAN\nKEEP BRINGING PEOPLE INTO THE WORK FORCE AND NOT LOWER THE\nUNEMPLOYMENT RATE? WE'LL BE LOOKING AT WAGES AND\nINFLATION. TO ME IT PUTS THE FED GOVERNOR\nAT THE CENTER HERE. SHE MADE THE MAJOR SPEECH ON\nTHIS A WEEK OR SO AGO, AND THIS SEEMS TO BE ANIMATING THE\nFEDERAL RESERVE. >> TODAY'S TWITTER QUESTION IS\nTHE FED HOLDS OFF FOR NOW BUT WILL IT HIKE IN 2016, YES\nNOVEMBER, YES DECEMBER, NO, NOT AT ALL THIS YEAR WHAT SAY YOU?\n>> I THINK THEY'LL GO IN DECEMBER IF THE DATA REMAINS\nREASONABLY POSITIVE ON THE JOB MARKET.\n>> YOU AND 45% CURRENTLY OF THE TWITTER UNIVERSE.\nSTEVE LIESMAN, THANK YOU.",

THAT'S GOOD NEWS.\n>> THERE IT WAS. SHE SAID IT, I DIDN'T MAKE IT\nUP. ROOM TO RUN.\nMOST ECONOMISTS NOW PEGGING DECEMBER AS THE LIKELY TIME FOR\nTHE NEXT FED RATE HIKE. THE FED MARKET SEES A 12% CHANCE\nFOR NOVEMBER AND AT 50% IN DECEMBER.\nAT OXFORD, THEY'RE SAYING IT WAS WITH SEVERAL KEY INDICATIONS AND\nINDICATIONS FROM CHAIR YELLEN SUGGESTS THE FED IS STRONGLY\nPOISED TO RAISE RATES IN DECEMBER.\nNOT SO MUCH BELIEF OVER THERE BY MIKE ENGLAND.\nHE SAYS THE THREE DISSENTS SUGGESTS THE FED IS ON THE BRINK\nOF TAKING ACTION PERHAPS THUMBING THEIR NOSE AT A NEW\nADMINISTRATION IN NOVEMBER AFTER ALL.\nINSISTED YESTERDAY THE FED NOT MOTIVATED BY POLITICS IN THIS\nDECISION, GUYS. >> WHY DOESN'T SHE JUST RAISE IN\nNOVEMBER? >> THAT WOULD BE SIX DAYS BEFORE\nTHE ELECTION. >> SHE'S NOT MOTIVATED BY\nPOLITICS. >> IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO\nSEE IF THEY COME UP WITH ANOTHER REASON NOT A HIKE.\nTHERE ARE THOSE WHO ACCUSE THE FEDERAL RESERVE OF MOVING THE\nGOAL POSTS YET AGAIN. >> CAN I WIND BACK TO THE BREXIT\nVOTE AGAIN? DO YOU REMEMBER HOW THE FED\nDELAYED THE RATE MOVE BECAUSE OF THE BREXIT ISSUE OR RATHER\nBECAUSE OF FEARS OF TURMOIL IN THE MARKETS?\nTHIS COULD PLAY OUT AGAIN COME NOVEMBER.\nIF THERE IS GOING TO BE A CLOSE RACE, IF THERE ARE SIGNS OF\nMARKET TURMOIL, THAT'S GOING TO BE YET ANOTHER REASON FOR THE\nFED TO SIT ON ITS HANDS. >> SHE WAS ASKED ABOUT THAT\nYESTERDAY AND I THINK IF THERE IS ACTUAL VOLATILITY IN THE\nMARKET, IF THERE'S A BIG SELLOFF IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER,\nREMEMBER THE FED MEETS BEFORE THE ELECTION.\nSO IT'S REALLY HARD IN MY OPINION FOR THE FED TO SAY WE\nARE NOT HIKING BECAUSE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN AMERICA.\nI THINK THAT'S A REALLY TROUBLESOME EXCUSE FROM THE\nCENTRAL BANK. >> BUT IT CAN CERTAINLY SAY\nWE'RE NOT HIKING BECAUSE WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE MARKET\nVOLATILITY AND WE DON'T WANT TO ADD TO IT.\n>> WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE THIS FED CONVERSATION IN JUST A\nMINUTE. ACTUALLY WE'RE GOING TO DO\nHEADLINES BUT MAYBE WE'LL CONTINUE RIGHT THIS MINUTE\nBECAUSE DEAN IS HERE TO TALK ABOUT THIS.\nDEANO IS BANK EXECUTIVE HAVEN'T. BOTH PREVIOUSLY WORKED AT THE\nFED. STEVE IS GOING TO STICK AROUND.\nI HAVE ONE QUESTION -- WE CAN FOLLOW UP ON WHAT WAS JUST BEING\nSAID HERE. ON THE POLITICAL FRONT, I\nTHOUGHT ONE OF THE MOST FASCINATING THINGS THAT WAS SAID\nWAS SHE SAID, LOOK, WHEN TRANSCRIPTS OF ALL OF THIS COME\nOUT FIVE YEARS FROM NOW, I ASSURE YOU YOU WILL NOT FIND ANY\nPOLITICAL INFLUENCE. I AGREE.\nI IMAGINE IN FIVE YEARS WE WON'T SEE ANYTHING IN THE TRANSCRIPT.\nBUT MY QUESTION IS SINCE YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN PART OF THIS, ARE\nTHERE PHONE CALLS GOING ON OR OTHER THINGS THAT WOULDN'T BE\nRECORDED IN THE TRANSCRIPT WHERE PEOPLE ARE SAYING, LOOK, WE\nSHOULD JUST NOT TALK ABOUT POLITICS?\n>> YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. THE PEOPLE KNOW THAT THEY'RE\nBEING RECORDED. THERE'S OTHER THINGS THAT MIGHT\nBE SAID BEHIND THE SCENES IN PHONE CALLS, SIDE BARS, ET\nCETERA. AND THEY'RE AWARE OF THE\nPOLITICAL CALENDAR. AND TO JULIANNE'S POINT, THEY'RE\nAWARE OF THE VOLATILITY. IT'S NOT ABOUT THE ELECTION.\nIT'S NOT ABOUT THE OUTCOMES. IT'S ABOUT HOW THE MARKET MIGHT\nREACT. IT'S A READY MADE EXCUSE FOR\nNOVEMBER. YOU'RE ASKING FOR MY OPINION, I\nWOULD SAY YES. >> YES THEY STAND FAST.\nSO NOTHING IN '16? >> THAT'S MY VIEW.\nAGAIN, IT'S LIKE -- YOU KNOW, IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE THREE\nDISSENTS, TO ME THAT'S YELLEN PUTTING A STAKE IN THE GROUND.\nSHE WAS WILLING TO TAKE THE THREE DISSENTS BECAUSE SHE HAD\nCONVICTION. SHE WANTED TO STAY WHERE SHE WAS\nWILLING TO TAKE THE THREE DISSENTS.\nTHEREFORE NOW THAT THOSE GUYS HAVE PLAYED THEIR HAND, THOSE\nTHREE PRESIDENTS, THEY PLAYED THEIR HAND.\nNOW WHAT? >> IS THERE A NEW METRIC OUT\nTHERE. THEY SAID WE HAVE A JOBS AND\nINFLATION. WE'VE DONE IT ON JOBS WAITING\nFOR INFLATION TO COME UP. NOW WE'RE BACK LOOKING AT THE\nJOBS MANDATE BECAUSE THERE'S THIS NOTION OF ROOM TO RUN.\nIS THAT A NEW METRIC OUT THERE FOR THE FED?\nAND HOW DO YOU WORK WITH THAT? >> YOU KNOW, HOW MANY METRICS\nHAVE WE HAD OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS?\nEVERY YEAR THIS SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A NEW METRIC.\n>> EVERY MONTH MAYBE. >> I DON'T WANT TO EXAGGERATE,\nBUT CERTAINLY THERE'S BAN NEW METRIC.\nWE'VE BEEN FOCUSED ON DIFFERENT METRICS OVER DIFFERENT TIMES THE\nLAST FEW YEARS. SO ABSOLUTELY, THAT IS AN ISSUE\nWITH MOVING GOAL POSTS. >> IF I COULD JUMP IN FOR A\nSECOND. I THINK YOU'RE OVERDOING THE\nMOVING THE GOAL POST MOVE. IT'S MAXIMUM EMPLOYMENT AND\nPRICE STABILITY DEFINED AS 2% INFLATION.\nPEOPLE ONLY LOOKING AT PAYROLLS HAVE BEEN MISSING THE LARGER\nPOINT WHICH IS THAT UNEMPLOYMENT HASN'T DECLINED THIS YEAR.\nTOTAL HOURS WORKED HAVE BARELY MOVED SINCE FEBRUARY.\nAT THE SAME TIME CORE PC INFLATION, SAME AS IT WAS IN\nFEBRUARY. INFLATION EXPECTATIONS STILL\nSOFT. AND THEN THE MOST RECENT RUN OF\nTHE DATA, A LITTLE SOGGY. IT'S PERFECTLY REASONABLE AND\nCONSISTENT IN THIS SITUATION TO LET THE ECONOMY RUN A BIT MORE,\nLET THIS SECOND HALF PLAY THROUGH AND MOVE AT THE END OF\nTHE YEAR. WHICH I'M CONFIDENT THEY WILL\nDO. >> THIS IS PETER.\nTHE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS FALLEN FROM 10% TO 5% ESSENTIALLY.\nCORE PCI IS HIGH FOR TEN STRAIGHT MONTHS AND HIVE RAISED\nONCE. >> CAN I COMMENT ON THAT?\nI WENT BACK THIS MORNING AND LOOKED AT CHAIR YELLEN'S SPEECH\nIN AUGUST AT JACKSON HOLE AND I LOOKED AT HER TESTIMONY.\nTHIS NOTION THAT SE POSSIBILITY THAT THERE'S MORE LABOR SHOULD\nDETERMINE POLICY IS NONEXISTENT IN BOTH OF THOSE TWO SPEECHES.\n>> SO I THINK IT'S FAIR, STEVE, TO SAY THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS\nDRAWN TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO THE PAYROLL NUMBERS THEMSELVES\nRATHER THAN LOOKING AT THE BROADER PICTURE OF THE LABOR\nMARKET AS WELL AS THE FACT THAT THERE STILL ISN'T THE PROGRESS\nYET DEFINITIVE PROGRESS THAT THEY'D LIKE TO SEE ON THE\nINFLATION SIDE OF THE MANDATE. BUT WE KNOW WHAT THE MANDATE IS.\nWE KNOW WHAT THE DATA IS. IT WOULD BE CURIOUS TO PUSH\nRATES HIGHER IN AN EFFORT TO RAISE INFLATION AND INFLATION\nEXPECTATION. THAT'S YOUR GOAL WITHOUT A VERY\nCONVINCING BACKDROP OF FIRMING UP IN THE LABOR MARKET.\n>> GIVEN WHAT YOU JUST SAID, WHAT ARE YOU TELLING YOUR\nCLIENTS? WHAT DO THEY RAISE IF THEY RAISE\nEVER? >> I THINK THEY ARE RAISING 60%,\n65% PROBABILITY THEY'RE RAISING IN DECEMBER.\n>> GIVE ME A REASON WHY YOU THINK THAT.\n>> BECAUSE I HAVE REASON TO BE OPTIMISTIC FOR THE SECOND\nBALANCE OF THE YEAR. >> CAN I FOLLOW UP ON THAT?\nI WANT A NUMBER THAT I CAN FOLLOW TO TRY TO GET A SENSE OF\nWHAT THE FED'S GOING TO DO. DO YOU NEED TO SEE THE\nUNEMPLOYMENT RATE DECLINE? OR SOME FORM OF THE DECLINE AND\nEVEN THE U-6 WHICH IS THE BROADER MEASURE OF LABOR SLACK\nIN ORDER FOR THE FED TO GET CONVINCED THAT THE AMOUNT OF JOB\nGROWTH OUT THERE IS ACTUALLY TIGHTENING UP THE LABOR MARKET?\n>> AS YOU WELL KNOW, STEVE, IT'S NEVER DOWN TO ANY ONE SINGLE\nMETRIC WHICH WAS THE MISTAKE OF FOCUSING EXCLUSIVELY ON PAYROLLS\nIN THIS DEBATE. BUT CERTAINLY I THINK IF THEY\nWERE TO SEE A COMBINATION OF STRENGTH IN THE PAYROLLS -- THE\nLAST PAYROLL REPORT WAS A BIT SOGGY.\nWIER SEEING A LITTLE BIT MORE FIRMING IN THE PRIVATE PAYROLLS\nCOMBINED WITH, YOU KNOW, A TENTH DOWN OR SO RESUMPTION OF\nDECLINES. THIS IS THE LARGER PICTURE YOU\nWANT TO SEE. YOU ALSO WANT TO SEE THIS SECOND\nHALF GROWTH FINALLY PLAYED THROUGH.\nIT'S A SENSE OF THE MOMENTUM HERE THAT'S PUSHING YOU.\nGIVES YOU MORE CONFIDENCE ON THE INFLATION FRONT.\nREMEMBER WE STILL NEED THAT PROGRESS ON INFLATION.\n>> DINO DOES -- KRISHNA HAS HIS REASONING OR UNDERSTANDING.\nON THE OTHER HAND IS THE FED UNDERMINING ITS CORRECT GOING TO\nWHAT APPEARS TO SOME AS NEW METRICS HERE?\n>> I THINK THE CREDIBILITY OF THE ARGUMENT IS OVERDONE.\nTHEY CAN SAY, LOOK, WE'RE BEING ANALYTICAL.\nWE ARE ADJUSTING TO A NEW ENVIRONMENT AND TRYING TO FIND\nMETRICS TO SUIT THAT NEW ENVIRONMENT.\nI'M NOT SO MUCH CONCERNED ABOUT THAT SPECIFIC ASPECT ABOUT\nCREDIBILITY. YOU KNOW, I THINK THE QUESTION\nIS, YOU KNOW, WHAT -- WHERE ARE THEY RIGHT NOW WITH THEIR POLICY\nMIX? WHERE ARE THEY GOING?\nYOU KNOW, HAVE THEY CLEARLY ARCTICALLY WHAT IS DRIVING THE\nFUNCTION BECAUSE YOU COULD MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT ALL AS HAS\nBEEN SAID, YOU KNOW, ALL OF THE GOAL POSTS THAT THEY SET OUT\nSOME TIME BACK HAVE BEEN MET. THE EMPLOYMENT, THE PICTURE\nWHERE THE ECONOMY IS RELATIVE TO POTENTIAL.\nTHAT'S ALL BEEN MET. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THEY\nCLEARLY WANT COMING OUT OF THE CRISIS STILL THAT THEY WANT TO\nBE SURE. THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE A BOJ\nSTYLE REVERSAL AND GO BACK TO ZERO.\nAND THAT'S REALLY THE STRATEGIC ASSET.\n>> THIS DEBATE IS GOING TO CONTINUE, GUYS.\nWE GOT TO LEAVE IT THERE. WE APPRECIATE IT.\nDINO, THANK YOU.",

IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU THIS\nMORNING, SIR. >> THANKS, YOU TOO.\n>> SO WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT THE FED SAID YESTERDAY?\nBECAUSE JANET YELLEN DID SAY A RATE HIKE IS LIKELY THIS YEAR.\nTHEN SHE LAID OUT THREE CONTINGENCIES THAT SHE'D NEED TO\nSEE. JOBS, GROWTH CONTINUING.\nNEED TO BE LOOKING AT UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DOWN.\nIN ORDER FOR ALL OF THIS TO STAY IN WHAT SHE'S CALLING FOR FAIR\nBALANCE. HOW LIKELY IS IT THAT YOU DO SEE\nA RATE HIKE THIS YEAR? >> I THINK IT'S QUITE LIKELY.\nWHAT WE'RE SEEING IS JANET YELLEN THREADING A NEEDLE.\nTHAT FOR RISK MANAGEMENT REASONS, FOR INTERNATIONAL\nREASONS YOU NEED TO REALLY HOLD OFF A LONG TIME ON RATE\nINCREASES. AND SHE'S TRYING TO KEEP THIS\nCOMMITTEE TOGETHER. THIS IS A GROUP OF POLICY MAKERS\nAND IT'S CLEAR THE MOVE IS GOING IN DECEMBER BARRING SOME REAL\nSETBACK. >> SHE DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE\nBOUGHT INTO WHAT ERIC ROSENGREN HAS BEEN BUYING EITHER WHICH IS\nTHIS IS DANGEROUS TO KEEP RATES AT THESE LEVELS.\nIT HURTS RETIREES, PENSION COMPANIES, AND THE LONGER YOU\nKEEP IT HERE THE MORE PAIN YOU COULD INFLICT.\n>> YEAH. I THINK THAT'S TELLING.\nERIC ROSENGREN WAS DOVISH JUST THREE YEARS AGO.\nNOW HE'S HAWKISH. IF YOU LOOK AROUND THE SYSTEM,\nTHE ADVOCATES FOR KEEPING LOW LONGER ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN.\nKEEPING THAT POLICY IN PLACE, IT'S TAKING EVERY BIT OF KIND OF\nMANEUVERING THAT JANET YELLEN HAS ON A COMMITTEE.\n>> STEVE, I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU A QUESTION AND MAYBE NEIL WOULD\nLIKE TO COME IN HERE AS WELL. WE'VE SEEN THE RECENT ELECTION\nTHAT DONALD TRUMP HAS DIRECTLY ATTACKED JANET YELLEN AND IN A\nSENSE POLITICIZED THE FED. HOW DO YOU THINK THIS IS GOING\nTO PLAY INTO THE FED'S DECISION MAKING PROCESS IN THE COMING\nMONTHS? >> WELL, IT'S AN INTERESTING\nQUESTION BECAUSE IT'S ONE THING TO SAY THEY'RE NOT POLITICAL.\nBUT THAT'S TO SAY THEY'RE NOT HUMAN BEINGS.\nTHE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW THEY CAN BE -- THEY CAN LIVE IN THE\nVACUUM AND MAKE POLICY IN THE VACUUM IS JUST NOT CREDIBLE.\nTHEY HAVE TO BE AWARE IN HOW THEIR POLICY PLAYS.\nIF NOTHING ELSE IN ORDER TO SECURE THE FUTURE OF THE\nINSTITUTION. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS TO\nPLAY INTO IT. I THINK THAT ULTIMATELY THEY\nWOULD PREFER NOT TO HAVE ANY ROLL IN IT.\nI THINK THEY DON'T WANT TO BE BLAMED FOR HAVING AN INFLUENCE\nSUCH THAT THEY CAN SAY THE FED HIKE, THE MARKET TANKED, TRUMP\nWAS ELECTED. OR THE IDEA THAT THEY HELD.\nTHE WAY TRUMP HAS SET IT UP FOR BETTER OR WORSE, IT'S A DAMNED\nIF YOU DO, DAMNED IF YOU DON'T DECISION.\n>> I TEND TO AGREE WITH THAT. BUT I DO THINK THERE'S A WAY\nTRUMP IS SO CRITICAL SAYING THESE LOW INTEREST RATE POLICIES\nARE ABOUT TRYING TO GET HILLARY CLINTON ELECTED OR HELP OBAMA I\nTHINK THAT CAN CREATE A COUNTER REACTION.\nIF ANYTHING I WOULD IMAGINE THAT IT INCREASES THE RESOLVE TO\nSTICK WITH THE POLICY THEY'VE LAID FORTH AND TIGHTEN WHEN THEY\nTHINK IT'S TIME. >> I THINK THE CONVERSATION ON\nTIGHTENING HAS CHANGED HERE. IN THE DATA DEPENDENCY WE'VE\nBEEN POUNDING IN OUR HEADS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS.\nTHE DATA HAS DETERIORATED OVER THE PAST MONTHS.\nNOW WE'RE HEARING THEY WANT TO RAISE RATES.\nI THINK IT'S SHIFTED TO OH MY GOD WE'VE RAISED RATES ONCE IN\nTEN YEARS. WE HAVE ALL THESE EXCESSES THAT\nHAVE BEEN BUILDING FOR YEARS. WE'VE REACHED AN INFLECTION\nPOINT. OH, MY GOD.\nAND THAT'S A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION.\nOH, WE'RE DATA DEPENDENT AND FOCUSED ON THAT.\n>> THERE IS SOMETHING BOTH CAMPS CAN POINT TO.\nFIRST OF ALL, CAN YOU REALLY BE SITTING AT ZERO INTEREST RATES\nTHIS FAR AFTER A FINANCIAL CRISIS WHEN IT SEEMS LIKE THE\nAPPROPRIATE TIME TO BE AT ZERO? SECOND OF ALL, CAN YOU RAISE\nRATES WHEN THE ECONOMY IS ON WOBBLY GROUND?\n>> IT IS THE ABSOLUTE SCENARIO FOR THE FED.\nTRYING TO IMAGINE A ROOM WITH DONALD TRUMP AND JANET YELLEN\nFACING EACH OTHER OFF AND TALKING ABOUT THIS.\nTHE MIND BOGGLES. >> I WANT TO JUST INTERRUPT THAT\nTHOUGHT FOR A SECOND. LOOK.\nEVERYBODY ALWAYS SAYS THE FED IS IN A BOX.\nGUESS WHAT. THAT'S THEIR JOB.\nTHEIR JOB IS ALWAYS TO BE IN THE BOX SOMEWHERE BETWEEN MAXIMUM\nEMPLOYMENT AND STABLE INFLATION. THAT CREATES AN ONGOING DILEMMA.\nAND EVERY FOUR YEARS, THAT BOX INCLUDES A POLITICAL DILEMMA.\nSO IT'S NOT A NIGHTMARE SCENARIO.\nIT'S A SCENARIO. IT'S A RATHER NORMAL AND REGULAR\nSCENARIO. >> THIS IS NO USUAL BOX THEY PUT\nTHEMSELVES IN. THIS IS A CORNER THAT THEY PUT\nTHEMSELVES IN. ONE THING TO REMEMBER, EIGHT\nYEARS INTO A RECOVERY. >> LOOK.\nTHE ONE THING OF ALL THINGS YELLEN WANTS TO AVOID IS THE\nSCENARIO OF HIKING AND HAVING TO GO BACK.\nIF NOTHING ELSE IS CONSISTENT IN FED POLICY, IT'S THE NEED OR THE\nDESIRE TO AVOID THAT. >> TRYING TO AVOID THE FINANCIAL\nCRISIS? MAYBE THAT'S THE TOP PRIORITY.\n>> MAYBE AFTER AVOIDING THE NEXT FINANCIAL CRISIS.\n>> I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE LAST WORD, NEIL.\nIT'S HARD TO EDGE IN WHEN YOU'RE NOT SITTING AT THE TABLE.\n>> ONE THING TO REMEMBER, IF YOU WENT BACK IN TIME AND TOLD\nYELLEN YOU'D BE CHAIRWOMAN THERE WOULD BE 0% OR 0.5% RATES, WHAT\nWOULD YOU DO? SHE'S SAY TIGHTENING.\nTHEY'RE MOVING GRADUALLY DESPITE THE ECONOMICS.\n>> THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.",

WE LOVE THESE STORIES.\nFROM SELLING T-SHIRTS ON THE STREET TO EARNING OVER $100\nMILLION IN REVENUE, ONE COMPANY HAS FOUND SUCCESS IN BUILDING A\nBRAND OF OPTIMISM. JOINING US NOW IS THE COFOUNDER\nOF LIFE IS GOOD. GOOD MORNING.\nJOHN, CAN YOU HEAR US? >> YEAH, ANDREW.\nHOW ARE YOU? >> HOW ARE YOU DOING?\n>> I'M DOING WELL. >> TELL US FOR THOSE UNINITIATED\nHOW YOU STARTED YOUR COMPANY AND WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT.\n>> WELL, THAT'S -- THE SHORT VERSION IS MY BROTHER AND I\nWANTED TO CONVERT ART AND BUSINESS SOMEHOW.\nWE FOUND T-SHIRTS TO DO THAT. WE BASICALLY LIVED OUT OF A VAN\nFOR FIVE YEARS TRYING TO SELL SHIRTS TO KIDS IN COLLEGE DORMS\nWITHOUT MUCH SUCCESS. FINALLY WE LANDED ON SOMETHING\nAFTER SOME BEING WILDLY UNSUCCESSFUL.\nWE FOUND THIS ONE SHIRT THAT SAID LIFE IS GOOD WITH THIS\nCHARACTER NAMED JAKE. AND THAT CHANGED OUR LIVES\nFOREVER. THAT SHIRT TOOK OFF AND WE\nSTARTED BUILDING ON THAT. OVER THE YEARS WE BUILT SO MUCH\nFROM OUR CUSTOMERS ON THAT MESSAGE.\nTHAT LIFE ISN'T EASY, LIFE ISN'T PERFECT.\nTHE PEOPLE THAT ARE MOST LOYAL TO OUR BRAND ARE THE ONES THAT\nHAVE BEEN THROUGH THE MOST ADVERSITY.\n>> AND WHAT WAS IT ABOUT THAT MOMENT?\nWAS IT JUST THE T-SHIRT ITSELF? WAS THERE A MARKETING\nOPPORTUNITY AROUND IT? WHAT WAS THE INFLECTION POINT\nTHERE? >> IT WAS ACTUALLY A\nCONVERSATION WE HAD A LOT ABOUT HOW PEOPLE GET FED A LOT OF\nNEGATIVE NEWS AND IT'S HARD TO NAVIGATE AND WE WONDERED HOW TO\nCREATE A RALLYING CRY FOR OPTIMISTS.\nTHAT'S WHERE THE FIRST LIFE IS GOOD SHIRT CAME FROM.\nPEOPLE WE'VE REALIZED SINCE THEN WHETHER IT'S A WARTIME, WHETHER\nTHE ECONOMY IS STRUGGLING, PEOPLE WANT SOMETHING POSITIVE\nTO RALLY AROUND. AND FORTUNATELY OUR BRAND HAS\nBECOME ONE OF THOSE THINGS. >> IT'S ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS\nABOUT AMERICA, ISN'T IT? I'VE NOTICED IN THE PAST THAT\nPESSIMISM SELLS IN EUROPE AND OPTIMISM SELLS IN AMERICA.\nBUT I'M CURIOUS ARE YOU SEEING AT THE MOMENT MORE DEMAND FOR\nOPTIMISM AMONGST THE CONSUMERS YOU'RE SELLING TO GIVEN THE\nGLOOMY TONE OF THE ELECTION AND ALL THE FEAR AMONGERING AND\nSTUFF? >> WE ACTUALLY ARE, ABSOLUTELY.\nAND WE'VE SEEN IT AS I MENTIONED IN WARTIME.\nAND AT FIRST WHEN SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAPPENS IN THIS\nCOUNTRY, LET'S SAY 9/11, WE DIDN'T KNOW IF IT WAS PROBABLY\nTO SEND OUT. BUT THEY WANT IT MORE THAN EVER.\nTO A LESSER DEGREE RIGHT NOW, IT'S A STRANGE YEAR AND THERE'S\nA LOT OF TENSION ON DIFFERENT LEVELS.\nAND PEOPLE THAT THE DEMAND IS HIGHER.\nAND I THINK PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO RISE ABOVE THE NOISE\nAND THE MUD SLINGING. AND WE'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE\nTHAT. WE STARTED SOMETHING MONDAY\nCALLED POSITIVE STATE. AND WE'RE HIGHLIGHTING PEOPLE\nTHAT ARE DOING GOOD IN EVERY STATE IN THE 50 DAYS LEADING UP\nTO THE ELECTION AND WE'RE GIVING OUT GRANTS TO PEOPLE IN EVERY\nSTATE TO HELP THEM GROW GOOD IN THEIR COMMUNITY.\n>> THAT'S ANOTHER QUESTION I HAD.\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT YOUR CONSUMERS, IS THERE A PARTICULAR\nDEMOGRAPHIC THAT IS HUNGRY FOR OPTIMISM OR A PARTICULAR PART OF\nTHE COUNTRY? AND IS IT CORRELATED TO\nSUNSHINE? >> WE ACTUALLY -- IT'S NOT A\nDEMOGRAPHIC BASED ON AGE OR BACKGROUND.\nIT'S REALLY, YOU KNOW, IT'S ABOUT OPTIMISTS AND THEN AST\nABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO HELP CONVERT TO OPTIMISM.\nIT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT. >> JOHN, THIS IS A BUSINESS\nQUESTION. MAYBE IT'S A HARD BUSINESS\nQUESTION. WHAT'S THE DEFENSIBILITY OF A\nT-SHIRT COMPANY IN THIS DAY AND AGE WHEN I IMAGINE IF MANY OF US\nHAD A GREAT SLOGAN AND I CAN'T CLAIM I HAVE ONE AT THE MOMENT\nCOULD START A T-SHIRT COMPANY TOMORROW?\n>> IT'S A LOW BARRIER TO ENTRY. SO ABSOLUTELY.\nIT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WE JUMPED IN.\nFORTUNATELY WE FOUND SOMETHING WITH MUCH GREATER DEPTH THAN A\nTRENDY SLOGAN. WE LEARNED THAT FROM OUR\nCUSTOMERS. WE DIDN'T KNOW AT THE BEGINNING\nWE'RE TRYING TO CELEBRATE THE GOOD, HELP PEOPLE FOCUS ON THE\nGOOD. WE LEARNED SOMETHING MUCH\nGREATER WHICH IS LIFE ISN'T EASY, LIFE ISN'T PERFECT, LIFE\nIS GOOD. AND AGAIN, PEOPLE SEEM TO BE\nDRAWN TO OUR BRAND EVEN MORE WHEN THEY GO THROUGH DIFFICULT\nADVERSITY. >> JOHN, WE LOVE THE MESSAGE OF\nOPTIMISM. ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE DOOMSDAY\nSCENARIOS TALKED ABOUT AT THIS TABLE.\nAND IT'S GREAT SEEING A SUCCESS STORY LIKE YOURS.\nWISH YOU A LOT OF LUCK AT THE CONFERENCE TODAY AND WITH YOUR\nBUSINESS. THANKS.\n>> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING US ON.\n>> GREAT TO SEE YOU.",

GIGI HADID, I WAS WITH HER\nMOMENTS AGO AND TEAMED UP WITH MAXMARA.\nSHE HAS 22 MILLION FOLLOWERS ON INSTAGRAM, SO THIS BUSINESS\nCOUNTS ON THIS TYPE OF VISIBILITY THEY'RE GETTING.\nTHE ITALIAN FASHION SYSTEM HAS TO DEAL WITH THAT.\nWHILE BUSINESS IS GROWING UP 2.5% FROM LAST YEAR, THE FIRST\nSIX MONTHS OF THIS YEAR UP 2. %. EXPORTS GROWING BY 2.8%.\nSTILL MEANS WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE.\nIT'S A DIFFICULT TIME ECONOMICALLY SPEAKING IN ITALY\nAND GLOBALLY, BUT THE SECTOR IS UNDERGOING A DEEP\nTRANSFORMATION. FOR ITALY THIS MEANS AFTER MANY\nBRANDS SOLD IN THE LAST YEARS, BETWEEN 2000 AND 2010, ALL OF\nTHESE BRANDS SELLING OFF TO BIGGER GROUPS, NOW BRANDS LEFT\nHAVE TO GO THROUGH GENERATIONAL CHANGES AND HAVE TO WORK HARD ON\nHOW TO GET THROUGH THIS DIFFICULT TIME.\nONE OF THE BRANDS IS ROBERTO CAVALLI, AND THE NEW CREATIVE\nDIRECTOR, WE MET WITH HIM. THIS IS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY ABOUT\nTHE COLLECTION THAT WENT ON YESTERDAY.\n>> MILAN HAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST TEXTILE INDUSTRIES IN THE WORLD.\nOF COURSE IT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT IF NOT THE MOST\nIMPORTANT. THERE'S A NEW ENERGY HERE, I'M\nHAPPY TO BE A PART OF IT. >> YOU'RE ONE OF THE NEW\nDESIGNERS, ONE OF THE YOUNG TALENTS.\nHOW DO YOU SEE THE CHANCE FOR YOUNG TALENTS TO EMERGE MANY\nTHIS CONTEXT? >> I THINK IT'S A REALLY GREAT\nTIME TO BE A NEW DESIGNER OR SOMEBODY WHO IS PART OF A NEW\nGENERATION, IF YOU WILL. IT'S LIKE YOU KIND OF READY\nAGAIN TO SEE NEW THINGS, SEE A NEW ENERGY.\nSEE NEW NAMES AS WELL. >> SO, AS FOR THE BUSINESS OF\nFASHION, WE'RE SEEING AGAIN, AS I WAS SAYING, MANY ITALIAN\nBRANDS GOING THROUGH TRANSFORMATION, LIKE VERSACE AND\nVALENTINO TALKING ABOUT POSSIBLE IPO IN 2017, PUTTING OFF FROM\nTHE ORIGINAL DATE OF 2016. WHILE ITALIAN FASHION STOCKS\nHAVE BEEN ON BOTH SIDES OF THE FENCE, MT. CLAIRE UP 20%,\nFERRAGAMO FLAT, AND TOTHS LOSING SOME.\nJUST A PLAIN FUN OF IT HERE, SO FAR JUST SO YOU GIRLS KNOW, BACK\nIN LONDON THE BIG SHOW THAT EVERYONE WAS EXCITED ABOUT WAS GUCCI, THAT COLLECTION GETTING A\nLOT OF GOOD REVIEWS HERE IN MILAN.\n>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT. >> GUCCI ALWAYS SOUNDS GOOD.\n>> MAKE A NOTE TO SELF.",

THEY'RE GOING AT YOUR DECISIONS\nAND YOUR TAX STRUCTURE. >> JOHN, I WONDER IF THERE'S AN\nIRONY IN ALL THIS. WE'VE WATCHED AMERICAN COMPANIES\nPURSUE INVERSIONS, TAKE THEIR BUSINESS ABROAD BECAUSE THEY\nTHOUGHT THE TAX RATES WERE GOING TO BE LOWER OR ENVIRONMENT MORE\nHOSPITABLE. WE'VE ARGUED IN THE UNITED\nSTATES THAT WE NEED TO CHANGE THINGS HERE BECAUSE OUR POLICIES\nARE NOT CONDUCIVE ENOUGH TO BUSINESS.\nI WONDER WHETHER THIS DECISION IN PART CHANGES THE CALCULUS\nWHICH IS TO SAY TO JILLIAN'S POINT WHETHER AMERICAN COMPANIES\nPLAN TO DECIDE TO PUT THOSE ON HOLD AND WHETHER IT TAKES ANY\nPRESSURE OFF ODDLY ENOUGH CONGRESS OR OTHERS IN WASHINGTON\nTO ACTUALLY MAKE SOME OF THE HARD DECISIONS WE'VE TALKED\nABOUT. BECAUSE THEY SAY TO THEMSELVES,\nACTUALLY, THIS IS A PRETTY ATTRACTIVE ENVIRONMENT RELATIVE\nTO THE POSSIBILITY THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET SUED AND FIND OUT\nRETROACTIVELY THAT YOUR TAX BILL IS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU\nTHOUGHT IT WAS. >> THAT'S AN INTERESTING\nQUESTION. I ACTUALLY THINK IT UPS THE ANTE\nHERE IN WASHINGTON. REMEMBER, WE'VE STILL GOT MORE\nTHAN $2 TRILLION TRAPPED OFFSHORE.\nAND I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT MONEY COME HOME.\nI'D LIKE TO SEE THE U.S. MAKE THE POLICY DECISION -- I'D HOPE\nTHE NEW ADMINISTRATION MIGHT THINK THIS.\nWE OUGHT TO BE A MAGNET FOR ALL HEADQUARTERS TO BE HERE.\nLET'S FIX OUR TAX CODE AND THEN HAVE A PREDICTABLE, RELIABLE,\nSET OF ADMINISTRATABLE FOLLOWONS AND IT CAN BE ATTRACTIVE AGAIN.\nI DON'T THINK ANY WOULD LIKE TO BE PREFERS ELSEWHERE IN THE U.S.\nTHE TAX CODE WE HAVE TODAY HAS DICTATED THAT IF YOU WANT TO GET\nYOUR FOREIGN EARNINGS HOME. >> THERE HAVE BEEN SUGGESTIONS\nTHAT THE U.S. FINE THAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR OF DEUTSCHE BANK IS\nTIT FOR TAT IN THIS. THE NUMBER IS RIGHT AT $14\nBILLION BOTH. ANY TRUTH TO THAT?\n>> I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT. BUT THESE BOXCAR SIZED FINES\nTHAT WE'RE SEEING, I'M NOT SURE THEY'RE REALLY HELPING ANYBODY\nGET THEIR ECONOMIES STRAIGHTENED OUT.\nI REALLY THINK BACK TO FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TAX POLICY,\nRIGHT ECONOMIC STRATEGIES AND THE WHOLE WORLD WOULD BE BETTER\nOFF WITH GREATER GROWTH. >> DO YOU THINK THAT THE\nRELATIONS -- TRADE RELATIONS BETWEEN US AND THE EU, TRADE\nRELATIONS BETWEEN US AND CHINA AND OTHER PLACES, ARE THEY UNDER\nMORE STRAIN THAN RECENTLY? OR AM I READING THE TEA LEAVES\nWRONG? >> NO.\nYOU'RE READING THOSE  WE'VE SEEN SOME OF THE EUROPEAN\nREACTION TO THE NEGOTIATIONS IN PRETTY EARLY STAGES.\nAND CLEAR LE AREN'T GOING TO GET ACROSS THE FINISH LINE BEFORE\nTHE END OF THIS YEAR. THEN THE PROBLEMS WE'RE HAVING\nIN TRYING TO GET TPP WHICH HAS BEEN SIGNED, AGREED TO, PASSED\nBY THE CONGRESS, WE STILL HOPE THAT THAT CAN HAPPEN AT THE END\nOF THE YEAR. BUT BOY, TRADE PRESSURE AROUND\nTHE WORLD IS I THINK PROBABLY AS TOUGH AS IT'S BEEN.\n>> WHAT ODDS WOULD YOU PUT ON TPP ACTUALLY GETTING PASSED\nHERE? >> YOU KNOW --\n>> IF YOU'RE BETTING YOUR MONEY? >> LOOK, LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS\nIN THE ELECTION. LET'S SEE WHERE WE GO.\nI THINK THERE'S -- SENATOR HATCH WAS ENCOURAGING A WEEK AGO.\nTHE PIECES ARE IN PLACE. I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION'S\nWORKED HARD. AND THE PUBLIC SUPPORT, THAT'S\nIMPORTANT.

              "text": "THEM.\nJOINING US IS THE REPORTER BEHIND THAT STORY, JULIA ENGLAND\nOF REPUBLICA, OUR OWN COURTNEY REAGAN JOINING THE CONVERSATION\nAS WELL. JULIA, HOW DID YOU DECIDE TO\nDELVE INTO THIS ISSUE, AND WHAT EXACTLY DID YOU FIND?\n>> HI, THERE. THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON.\nWE ARE DOING A SERIES ABOUT THE IMPACT OF ALGORITHMS ON OUR\nLIVES, BASICALLY COMPUTERS MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT THINGS\nFOR US. AND TRUTHFULLY, THE AMAZON\nALGORITHM IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S A $100\nBILLION COMPANY AND IF THEY CHOOSE TO SHOOT SALES TO ONE\nVENDOR OR ANOTHER, THAT CAN MAKE OR BREAK A COMPANY.\nSO WE CHOSE TO LOOK AT THE ALGORITHM THEY HAVE TO CHOOSE\nWITH COMPANY IS THE DEFAULT SELLER.\nWHEN YOU GO TO A PRODUCT ON AMAZON, YOU MIGHT NOT REALIZE\nTHERE ARE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE TRYING TO SELL IT TO YOU AND\nAMAZON'S ALGORITHM PICKS THE ONE VENDOR TO SHOW TO YOU.\n>> THIS IS AN ACTUAL ALGORITHM THAT IS ORDERING THEM IN A\nCERTAIN WAY, NOT JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT LOGGED IN AS A PRIME\nCUSTOMER, IT'S SORT OF GIVING YOU MASH-UP OF ALL THE PRODUCTS.\n>> RIGHT. WE DID OUR TESTING LOGGED IN AS\nA NONPRIME MEMBER, SO THIS IS ALL WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN\nYOU'RE NOT PRIME. ALTHOUGH WE DID CHECK, IT LOOKS\nTHE SAME WHEN YOU'RE PRIME, IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THERE'S A\nDIFFERENCE. >> COURTNEY, I'M TORN HERE,\nBECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND, THIS SEEMS SIMILAR TO A RETAIL STORE\nEND CAP, WHERE IF YOU -- AS A SUPPLIER, PAY MARKETING TO THE\nSTORE, YOU GET BETTER POSITION IN IT.\nI MEAN, ON THE OTHER HAND, PEOPLE MIGHT EXPECT BETTER\nPRICING TO GET PRIORITY. THEN THERE'S THE SHIPPING ISSUE.\nSOMETIMES THE CHEAP ESTROVEN DOR IS GOING TO TAKE A WEEK TO SHIP\nSOMETHING WHEREAS FROM AMAZON OR FULFILLED BY AMAZON IT MIGHT\nCOME IN A COUPLE DAYS EVEN IF IT COSTS MORE.\nWHAT'S THE FAIR WAY DO YOU THINK FOR AMAZON TO BE TRANSPARENT\nABOUT HOW IT'S RANKING THINGS? >> THIS IS A TOUGH ISSUE BECAUSE\nOF THE WAY THEIR BUSINESS MODEL WORKS.\nAS YOU KNOW, THEY OWN SOME INVENTORY AND SHIPS SOME\nINVENTORY. IT ALSO HAS INVENTORY IT\nFULFILLS ON BEHALF OF THIRD-PARTY SELLERS.\nTHEN IT HAS THIRD-PARTY SELLERS THAT AMAZON NEVER SEES OR\nTOUCHES THAT INVENTORY WHATSOEVER.\nTHERE COULD BE IDENTICAL PRODUCTS OF COURSE LISTED BY\nDIFFERENT SELLERS, AND SO THEN HOW THEY'RE RANKED AND HOW THEY\nSHOW UP AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT COMES THROUGH IN AN ALGORITHM.\nI DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY WHAT'S FAIR, BUT I KNOW THAT IN A TEST\nTHAT WE DID, A VERY SMALL-SCALE TEST EARLIER IN AUGUST, WE SAW\nSOME INTERESTING THINGS WITH PAMPERS DIAPERS.\nIF YOU TAKE A LOOK HERE, NONPRIME MEMBERS SAW A PRICE\nTHAT WERE ACTUALLY MUCH HIGHER THAN WHAT THE PRIME MEMBERS SAW\nSO THAT PRIME MEMBERS WERE GIVEN THE LOWEST POSSIBLE PRICES, AND\nIT SAYS EXCLUSIVE TO PRIME MEMBERS.\nSO THEN WE WERE FORCED TO CHOOSE FROM A THIRD PARTY SELLER WITH\nSIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PRICES. THAT'S WHAT WE FOUND AS\nINTERESTING. >> BUT PEOPLE PAY A LOT OF MONEY\nFOR PRIME, AND ISN'T IS BUSINESS'S RIGHT TO OFFER A\nPREMIUM PRODUCT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO PAY FOR IT?\n>> I THINK WHAT YOU'RE TRIBING ABOUT THE END CAP AND IT'S\nTOTALLY TRUE THAT AM SONL HAS THE RIGHT TO DO WHATEVER IT\nWANTS. IT'S ITS STORE.\nBUT AMAZON HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR AND CONSISTENT SAYING THIS\nALGORITHM IS VERY OBJECTIVE. AND JEFF BEZOS SAID REPEATEDLY\nWE'RE WILLING TO LOSE A SALE IF WE CAN GET A CUSTOMER A BETTER\nDEAL. THEY'VE MADE A LOT OF PROMISES\nABOUT HOW OBJECT THEY'VE ALGORITHM IS AND WHAT IT TAKES\nTO WIN IT. THE THINGS THEY SAY TO WIN IT\nARE LOW PRICE, GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE, FAST SHIPPING.\nTHEY DON'T SAY ACTUALLY THE BEST WAY TO WIN IT IS TO BE AMAZON OR\nFULFILLED BY AMAZON, WHICH IS WHAT OUR TEST FOUND.\nTHREE-QUARTERS OF THE TIME WHEN A PRODUCT WAS MORE EXPENSIVE BUT\nDID WIN THAT DEFAULT POSITION, IT WAS AMAZON OR FULFILLED BY\nAMAZON PARTNER. THIS IS A QUESTION MORE ABOUT\nWHAT THEY SAY AND WHAT THEY DO AS OPPOSED TO WHETHER IT'S RIGHT\nIN SORT OF THE ABSTRACT. >> I 100% AGREE WITH THAT.\nAND SORT OF OUR OBSERVATIONS FROM, AGAIN, OUR SMALL-SCALE\nTESTS, TOO, WAS THAT YOU SEEMED TO GET PREFERENTIAL PRODUCT\nPLACEMENT SERVICE, PRICES, SHIPPING, IF YOU ARE A PRIME\nMEMBER. YOUR SCREEN TENDED TO LOOK A\nLITTLE DIFFERENT AND/OR YOU ARE GIVEN THOSE FULFILLED BY AMAZON\nPRODUCTS, WHICH ARE OFTEN CHEAPER RIGHT AT THE TOP OF THE\nSEARCH. >> CUSTOMERS KEEP BUYING THE\nSTOCK JUST BREAKING THROUGH $800 A SHARE, SO WE'LL SEE WHERE IT\nGOES. >> IT'S TRUE.\n>> OUR THANKS TO BOTH OF YOU.",

LOOK AT THAT.\nTODAY THE CHIEF OF POLICE SAYING IT IS TIME TO GET THE STORY\nSTRAIGHT. >> I CAN TELL YOU FROM THE FACTS\nTHAT THE STORY'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT AS TO HOW IT'S BEEN\nPORTRAYED SO FAR. ESPECIALLY THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA.\n>> JONATHAN CIERI JOINS US LIVE FROM CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA,\nJONATHAN, THERE ARE DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF WHAT HAPPENED,\nDEPENDING ON WHO YOU TALK TO. BREAK IT DOWN FOR US.\n>> Reporter: EXACTLY. WELL FRIENDS OF KEITH LAMONT\nSCOTT, THE MAN SHOT BY OFFICERS SAY HE WAS UNARMED AT THE TIME\nHE WAS SHOT AND SIMPLY WAITING AROUND FOR HIS SON TO COME HOME\nFROM SCHOOL. SOME SAY HE WAS READING A BOOK\nAT THE TIME. BUT POLICE INSIST HE WAS\nCARRYING A HANDGUN AND THAT OFFICERS HAD GOOD REASON TO FEEL\nTHREATENED. LISTEN.\n>> MR. SCOTT, AS I SAID, EXITED HIS VEHICLE ARMED WITH A\nHANDGUN, AS THE OFFICERS CONTINUED TO YELL AT HIM TO DROP\nIT. HE STEPPED OUT, POSING A THREAT\nTO THE OFFICERS, AND OFFICER BRENTLY VINSON SUBSEQUENTLY\nFIRED HIS WEAPON, STRIKING THE SUBJECT.\n>> WE'RE WATCHING OUR BLACK MEN, THIS WEEK, BEING GUNNED DOWN AND\nTHERE'S NO REDRESS FOR OUR GRIEVANCES OF BLACK PEOPLE BEING\nKILLED WITH OUR BROTHER SCOTT, THEY SAID HE HAD A GUN, SOMEBODY\nSAID HE HAD A BOOK. >> Reporter: POLICE\nINVESTIGATORS SAY THEY DID FIND A GUN AT THE SCENE AFTER THE\nSHOOTING, BUT THEY DID NOT FIND A BOOK.\nMELISSA. >> AND WHAT ARE POLICE EXPECTING\nIS GOING TO HAPPEN TONIGHT? >> Reporter: WELL, PROTEST\nORGANIZERS HAVE ALREADY ANNOUNCED THEY'RE PLANNING A\nDEMONSTRATION THIS EVENING HERE IN MARSHALL PARK.\nTHIS PARK IS NEAR THE CHARLOTTE MEK LEARNBURG GOVERNMENT\nBUILDING AS WELL AS AS POLICE HEADQUARTERS, WHICH OBVIOUSLY IS\nAT THE CENTER OF ALL OF THIS CONTROVERSY, BUT BOTH CITY\nOFFICIALS AND PROTEST ORGANIZERS ARE CALLING ON EVERYONE TO\nREMAIN CALM AND TRY TO DISCUSS MATTERS RATHER THAN RESORTING TO\nTHE VIOLENCE THAT WE SAW HERE IN CHARLOTTE LAST NIGHT.\nMELISSA. >> ALL RIGHT.\nTHANK YOU FOR THAT REPORT. POLICE SHOOTINGS, TERROR\nBOMBINGS, TWO BIG STORIES THAT WE ARE FOLLOWING.\nAS WE AWAIT DONALD TRUMP TO TAKE THE STAGE IN TOLEDO, OHIO, AND\nHILLARY CLINTON IN ORLANDO, FLORIDA.\nHOW WILL THEY HANDLE THESE TWO TOPIC KPS JOINING ME NOW IS\nCHRIS WALLACE. ANCHOR OF \"FOX NEWS SUNDAY\"\nHE'LL MODERATE THE THIRD AND FINAL PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE NEXT\nMONTH, SIR, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.\nLET'S START WITH THE CASES IN NEW YORK AND JERSEY, THESE\nTERROR BOMBINGS. I MEAN, THIS IS PRIME FOUGHTER\nIT SEEMS FOR DONALD TRUMP. DO YOU THINK HE'LL MAKE COMMENTS\nTODAY? >> WELL, THE ANSWER IS I DON'T\nKNOW WHETHER HE WILL. HE CERTAINLY HAS BEEN TALKING\nABOUT IT A EVER SINCE THE EXPLOSION OVER THE WEEKEND.\nAND YOU'RE RIGHT, MELISSA, BECAUSE THIS SPEAKS TO HIS IDEAS\nABOUT GETTING TOUGHER IN THE FIGHT ON TERROR, GETTING TOUGHER\nIN TERMS OF VETTING WHO'S ALLOWED INTO THIS COUNTRY.\nNOT QUITE SURE HOW THAT WOULD APPLY WHEN HE WAS SEVEN YEARS\nOLD. BACK IN THE '90s, SO YOU CAN'T\nGO BACK IN TIME TO THAT. AND HE WAS A NATURALIZED U.S.\nCITIZEN, BUT IT CERTAINLY DOES SPEAK TO THE ISSUE OF WHO WE LET\nINTO THE COUNTRY. CLINTON HAS TAKEN A DIFFERENT\nPOSITION ON THIS, TALKING MORE ABOUT WORKING WITH THE IS MUSLIM\nCOMMUNITY, MORE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND\nMUSLIMS AND TRYING TO GET EARLY WARNING SYSTEM IN THESE\nCOMMUNITIES IF THERE'S SOMEBODY WHO SHOWS SOME KIND OF CHANGE IN\nBEHAVIOR OR BECOMING MUCH MORE OF A RADICAL.\nSO IF THEY HAVE DIFFERENT APPROACHES AND WHETHER THEY\nDISCUSS IT TODAY OR NOT, THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT'S GOING\nTO COME OUT OVER THE COMING WEEKS AND ESPECIALLY IN THE\nFIRST. >> NOW IN TERMS OF POLICE\nSHOOTINGS, I SAW HILLARY CLINTON TWEET PRETTY QUICKLY AND TALK\nABOUT, WOW, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO.\nESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF KEITH LAMONT SCOTT AND SHE'S TALKING\nABOUT THE DIFFERENT NINGS HOW DOES SHE PLAY THIS ONE, CHRIS?\n>> THIS ONE'S TOUGHER. THE ONE IN TULSA, THE FELLOW,\nTERRENCE CRUTCHER WHO HAD HIS ARMS AND MUCH MORE QUESTIONABLE\nSHOOTING OF HIM, ALTHOUGH THE POLICE SAY THEY WERE WORRIED\nTHAT HE WAS REACHING INTO A CAR, THAT ONE SHE'S ALREADY REACHED\nOUT AND SAID, THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF WHAT SHE BELIEVES IS\nIMPROPER POLICE SHOOTING. AND IN HER EFFORT TO REACH OUT\nTO THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND GET THEM\nMOBILIZED, SHE'S OBVIOUSLY, I SUSPECT, GOING TO BE TALKING\nABOUT THIS. SHE HAS SAID SHE IS GOING TO\nTALK ABOUT BOTH CASES TODAY IN HER RALLY IN FLORIDA.\nOBVIOUSLY AS WE JUST HEARD AND THE KEITH SCOTT CASE, IT'S MUCH\nMORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE THERE WAS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN POLICE\nOFFICER WHO SHOT HIM, AND HE SAYS THAT SCOTT WAS CARRYING A\nGUN. SHO SO THAT BECOMES A MUCH MORE\nDIFFICULT CASE TO WEIGH IN ON. >> ALTHOUGH, ACTIVISTS IN THE\nAREA -- >> QUICKLY, LET ME QUICKLY SAY\nTRUMP HAS RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TULSA CASE AND SAY GEE, IT\nSEEMED LIKE IT SHOULD BE DOING EVERYTHING HE SHOULD WITH HIS\nHANDS RAISED. HE'S ALSO RAISED QUESTIONS --\n>> LET ME STOP YOU THERE. WE HAVE A SOUND BYTE.\nAND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT. THIS IS WHAT DONALD TRUMP HAD TO\nSAY. >> I WATCHED THE SHOOTING IN\nPARTICULAR IN TULSA. AND THAT MAN WAS HANDS UP, THAT\nMAN WENT TO THE CAR, TO ME LOOKED LIKE, YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY\nTHAT WAS DOING WHAT THEY WERE ASKING HIM TO DO.\nAND THIS YOUNG OFFICER -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE WAS\nTHINKING. I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE WAS\nTHINKING. BUT I'M VERY, VERY TROUBLED BY\nTHAT. >> OH CHRIS, HIS HANDLERS HAD TO\nBE NERVOUS WHEN HE WEIGHED INTO THAT TERRITORY.\nTHAT WAS DANGEROUS GROUND, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF WHAT HE SAID\nTHERE? >> I THINK IT'S NOT UNLIKE WHAT\nCLINTON HAS SAID WHICH IS THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE VIDEO,\nOBVIOUSLY WE'RE NOT THERE ON THE GROUND, IT'S EASY TO SECOND\nGUESS FROM THE 30,000 FEET, BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE VIDEO AND\nYOU SEE A GUY WHO MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN RESPONDING TO EVERY\nPOLICE DEMAND, IN FACT THE POLICE SAY HE WASN'T, BUT DID\nHAVE HIS HANDS UP, IT BECOMES A LOT MORE QUESTIONABLE AS WHY YOU\nNEED A DEADLY FORCE BECAUSE THE POLICE OFFICER, THE WOMAN WHO\nSHOT HIM AND KILLED HIM, IT WAS JUST AT THE SAME TIME THAT\nSOMEBODY HAD FIRED A TASER ON HIM TO DISABLE HIM AND YOU\nWONDER WHY THAT WASN'T ENOUGH AT A TIME -- AND OF COURSE THIS\nFELLA DID TURN OUT TO BE UNARMED, NO GUN ON HIM OR IN THE\nCAR. >> YEAH.\nMEANWHILE, POLLS SHOWING A CLEAR TIGHTENING IN THE PAST FEW\nWEEKS. I'M LOOKING AT THIS 538.COM\nGIVING HILLARY 56.8% CHANCE OF WINNING, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF\nTHIS ONE? >> WELL THE THING THAT'S\nINTERESTING THERE, THIS 538, THEY'VE GOT A REMARKABLY GOOD\nRECORD IN PREDICTING WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN ELECTIONS.\nI THINK IN 2012 THEY PREDICTED EVERY ONE OF THE TEN OR 12\nSO-CALLED TOSS-UP STATES AS TO HOW IT WAS GOING TO TURN OUT.\nWHILE CLINTON STILL HAS A LEAD. THIS IS THE CLOSEST THAT DONALD\nTRUMP HAS EVER BEEN IN THE 538 SURVEY OF STATES.\nI THINK THEY HAVE CLINTON AT 277 WHICH IS SEVEN OVER WHAT SHE\nNEEDS AND TRUMP AROUND 250 SOMETHING.\nSHE STILL HAS AN EASIER PATH BECAUSE HE'D HAVE TO WIN ALL OF\nTHE TOSS-UP STATES AND FLIP ONE STATE THAT NOW IS LEANING\nCLINTON AND SHE HAS A LOT OF VARIETY.\nSHE COULD LOSE ONE OF THE STATE THAT'S LEANING HER WAY AND PICK\nUP ONE OF THE OTHER TOSS-UP STATES AND STILL SAY OVER 270.\nAS WE HEAD INTO THE FIRST DEBATE.\nTHIS IS QUITE A CLOSE RACE, A LOT OF THE KEY TO-UP STATES LIKE\nOHIO AND FLORIDA AND NORTH CAROLINA WELL WITHIN THE MARGIN\nOF ERROR. SO DEPENDING ON WHAT HAPPENS IN\nTHE DEBATE, THE COMPLEXION OF THIS RACE COULD BE CHANGED\nDRAMATICALLY EITHER CLOSER OR ONE STRINGING OUT TO MORE OF A\nLEAD. >> IT'S SO INTERESTING WHEN YOU\nWATCH THE COMMENTS AROUND THOSE REPORTS.\nPEOPLE WHO DON'T BELIEVE IT'S AS CLOSE AS IT LOOKS RIGHT THERE.\nSTILL SAYING FLOST WAY SHE'S GOING TO RUN AWAY WITH IT.\nIT'S FASCINATING TO WATCH THE CONVERSATION, IN THE MEANTIME,\nCHRIS, WHAT DO YOU HAVE COMING UP ON FOX NEWS SUNDAY?\n>> WELL, SUNDAY, OF COURSE, WILL BE JUST 24 HOURS BEFORE THE\nFIRST DEBATE. WE'LL BE ALL ABOUT THAT.\nWE KNOW THAT ONE OF THE GUESTS FROM THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WILL BE\nDONALD TRUMP'S RUNNING MATE, GOVERNOR MIKE PENCE OF INDIANA,\nME WILL BE OUR GUEST ON SUNDAY. AND WE'RE STILL TALKING TO THE\nCLINTON CAMP ABOUT WHO THEY'RE GOING TO PUT IT OUT TO TALK.\nAND WE DID FIND OUT TODAY, THE COMMUNICATIONS CHIEF SAYS THAT\nSOMEBODY IS PLAYING DONALD TRUMP IN THE MOOK DEBATES, BUT WE\nSTILL DON'T KNOW WHO IT IS. AND BOY, THIS IS LIKE DEEP\nTHROAT BECAUSE WE STILL HAVEN'T FOUND OUT WHO IT IS THAT PLAYING\nDONALD TRUMP. AND I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS\nTHEY'RE KEEPING IT SO SECRET, MELISSA, IS BECAUSE IF WE KNEW\nWHO IT IS, WE HAVE A SENSE WHAT HAVE THEY THINK IS GOING TO BE\nTHE KIND OF PERSONALITY THAT DONALD TRUMP WILL BRING TO THIS\nDEBATE. >> I MEAN, I GUESS FAR WHILE\nTHEY WERE SAYING IT WAS MARK CUBAN, MAYBE THAT'S GONE AWAY\nAND HE'S DENIED OR WHATEVER. MAYBE IT'S ME AND I'M JUST NOT\nTELLING YOU -- NO, OF COURSE NOT.\nCHRIS WALLACE, THANK YOU SO MUCH.\nWE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT SHOW.",

WHILE CLINTON STILL HAS A LEAD.\nTHIS IS THE CLOSEST THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS EVER BEEN IN THE 538\nSURVEY OF STATES.

A LOT OF GOOD DETAILS THERE.\nLET'S LOOK AT MORE OF THIS LIST OF ITEMS THAT RAHAMI BOUGHT\nONLINE, KATHERINE JUST MENTIONED THIS.\nA -PFIOUVENDACK P OFITRI CC ACID DESCRIBED AS GREAT FOR BATH\nBOMBS. 10 PCP PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARDS.\n200 HARDENED LEAD MILLING BALLS. 100 E MATCH ELECTRIC IGNITERS\nAND 25 LEAD BALL BEARINGS. JOINING ME NOW, FORMER\nPROSECUTOR AND DEFENSE ATTORNEY. JOE, A FORMER ATTORNEY AND\nFORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR. THANKS FOR JOINING US.\nJOHNNA, WHEN I LOOK AT THAT LIST, I HAVE A HARD TIME BUYING\nOVER THE COUNTER ALLERGY MEDICINE AT CVS WITHOUT AN ID,\nTHEY'LL GIVE YOU ONE, BUT YOU GO ON EBAY, NO ONE SAID WHAT IS\nTHIS GUY DOING? >> NO, BECAUSE APPARENTLY IT IS\nLEGAL, NOT ONLY TO BUY BOMB-MAKING MATERIAL, BUT PEOPLE\nPUT MANIFESTOS ON HOW TO CREATE THE BOMBS ONLINE AND WE DO\nNOTHING ABOUT IT. AND I FELT THE SAME WAY, I CAN'T\nGO TO ANY WEBSITE AND THEN NOT GET FOLLOWED BY THAT WEBSITE\nEVERYWHERE ELSE I GO. WEFT TECHNOLOGY TO KNOW WHAT\nEVERYBODY IS DOING EVERY SECOND ONLINE, AND WHEN IT COMES TO\nTERRORISM, WHY ARE WE NOT CRACKING DOWN?\n>> YEAH, JOE, WHAT ABOUT THIS? I MEAN, IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS\nWHERE AT FIRST THEY SAY, NO ONE KNEW, THEN ALL OF THESE CLUES\nTURN UP, AND YOU SAY THIS MAN WAS DOING MANY, MANY THINGS THAT\nWOULD HAVE LEAD PEOPLE TO BELIEVE THERE WAS SOMETHING\nCOMING UP. >> THIS IS ONE OF THE SERIES OF\nCASES IN WHICH THE FBI HAD INFORMATION, WAS ASKED TO\nINTERVIEW PEOPLE AND DO THINGS AND DIDN'T DO IT.\nWHY DIDN'T THEY DO IT? BECAUSE THE GUIDE LIONELS THAT\nTHE FBI HAS, DO NOT ALLOW THEM TO GO BEYOND A CERTAIN POINT\nWITHOUT A CERTAIN EVIDENCE. NOW THE QUESTION IS, WHY HAS THE\nFBI DIRECTOR NOT ASKED THAT THOSE GUIDELINES BE CHANGED?\nIT IS HIS RESPONSIBILITY TO GIVE HIS AGENTS THE TOOLS TO DO THIS.\nI DON'T BLAME THE AGENTS WHO INITIALLY GOT THE INFORMATION\nFROM THE FATHER FOR NOT GOING FURTHER.\nTHEY WERE PROHIBITED FROM DOING SO BY THE FBI'S OWN GUIDELINES.\nMY QUESTION, WHY HASN'T JAMES COMEY CHANGED THE GUIDELINES OR\nFORCED THEM TO BE CHANGED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE?\n>> JOHNNA, THIS IS THE ARGUMENT, ON ONE HAND, THERE WAS ALL THIS\nEVIDENCE WHY DIDN'T DO SOMETHING?\nON THE OTHER HAND, YOU ALWAYS HEAR THE RESPONSE, IT IS\nDIFFICULT, YOU CAN'T ARREST SOMEONE FOR A CRIME THEY HAVEN'T\nCOMMITTED YET. >> THAT IS CORRECT.\nUNFORTUNATELY, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED HERE.\nBUT I HAVE TO DISAGREE WITH ONE THING THAT YOU SAID, AND THAT\nIS, IF YOUR OWN FATHER REPORTS YOU TO THE FBI AND SAYS, LISTEN,\nI KNOW THIS, THIS, AND THIS ABOUT MY SON THAT NOBODY ELSE\nKNOWS. AND THE FBI STANDS THERE WITH\nTHEIR HANDS AND SAYS I'M SORRY, I CAN'T DO IT.\nWE HAVE A PROBLEM THERE. NOT ONLY DO WE NEED TO CHANGE\nTHAT, WE NEED TO CHANGE THE LAWS THAT DON'T ALLOW US TO ARREST\nTHE BOMB MAKING MATERIALS ONLINE.\nTHANKS TO BOTH OF YOU. DONALD TRUMP AT THE PODIUM THERE\nIN STAUL, OKLAHOMA. LET'S LISTEN IN.\n>> WE'RE UP FIVE IN OHIO. IN CNN.\n[ APPLAUSE ] CNN, WE'RE UP THREE IN FLORIDA.\nNOW LEAD NEVADA, OHIO, WE LEAD IN NORTH CAROLINA, THE L.A.\nTIMES HAS US FOUR OR FIVE POINTS UP.\nSO, IT'S REALLY BEEN AMAZING. ON NOVEMBER 8th, WE'RE GOING TO\nWIN THIS STATE, WE'RE GOING TO WIN THE WHITE HOUSE.\nWE'RE GOING TO WIN IT BACK. WEIR GOING TO WIN IT BACK.\nTHIS IS A MOVEMENT, AND WE'RE TAKING OUR COUNTRY BACK FOR THE\nPEOPLE. WE'RE TAKING IT BACK.\nIT'S BEEN A LONG TIME. AS I TRAVEL THE COUNTRY, THE\nCROWDS GET BIGGER AND THE ENTHUSIASM GROWS.\nTHOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE, THEY JUST LEFT BECAUSE THEY\nFIGURE, WE CAN'T GET IN. UNLESS SOMEBODY -- WOULD ANYBODY\nLIKE TO GIVE UP THEIR SEAT? I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY\nTHAT. BUT THERE'S SO MUCH LOVE IN THE\nROOMS, THE WASHINGTON INSIDERS, THEY'RE PANICKING, THEY ARE VERY\nCONCERNED. THEY'RE LOOKING AT WHAT'S GOING\nON WITH THE POLLS AND THEY'RE SAYING, WHAT'S HAPPENING?\nTHIS WASN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN. IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN IN\nTHE PRIMARIES, AND THIS WASN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN, BUT IT'S\nHAPPENING, AND I THINK WE'RE GOING BRING IT ALL THE WAY.\n[ APPLAUSE ] WE ARE GOING TO REPLACE OUR\nFAILED AND CORRUPT ESTABLISHMENT WITH A NEW GOVERNMENT THAT\nSERVES YOU, YOUR FAMILY, THE COUNTRY, YOU'RE GOING TO BE\nHAPPY. THE CHANGE IS GOING TO BE TO\nBEGIN RIGHT AWAY. THE SKI NOVEMBER 8th, IF YOU CAN\nGET IN THERE A LITTLE EARLIER, THAT'S OKAY TOO.\nNOVEMBER 8th. MY ECONOMIC AGENDA CAN BE SUMMED\nUP IN THREE VERY BEAUTIFUL WORDS.\nJOBS, JOBS, JOBS. [ APPLAUSE ]\nWE HAVE TO BRING OUR JOBS BACK. ON MY FIRST DAY IN OFFICE, I'M\nGOING TO ORDER A REVIEW OF EVERY SINGLE REGISTRATION AND CHECK TY\nORDER ISSUED BY PRESIDENT OBAMA. ALL JOB KILLING REGULATIONS AND\nALL ILLEGAL EXECUTIVE ORDERS WILL BE IMMEDIATELY TERMINATED.\nEXCESSIVE REGULATION COSTS OUR ECONOMY $2 TRILLION YEARLY.\nCAN THAT YOU BELIEVE? $2 TRILLION A YEAR.\nI WANT TO PUT THAT MONEY BACK INTO THE POCKETS OF THE AMERICAN\nPEOPLE WHERE IT BELONGS. I AM GOING TO DIRECT THE\nDEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE TO IDENTIFY EVERY SINGLE VIOLATION\nOF OUR TRADING RULES BY OUR FOREIGN COMPETITORS WHO, IN MANY\nCASES, CHEAT. WE WILL APPLY EVERY LAWFUL\nREMEDY TO END THESE TRADE ABUSES ONCE AND FOR ALL.\nWE HAVE NO CHOICE. WE'RE GOING TO END THEM.\nTRADE WILL BE FAIR AND RESIP RI CALL AND PRODUCTS WILL BE MADE\nIN AMERICA AND SOLD ALL AROUND THE WORLD, LIKE WE USED TO DO\nIT. YOU KNOW, WHEN WE WERE SMART.\nWE'RE GOING TO PASS ONE OF THE BIGGEST AND BOLDEST TAX RUMPLE\nREFORMS AND TAX REDUCTIONS IN AMERICAN HISTORY.\nIT'S GOING TO INCLUDE A 15% TAX RATE FOR ALL BUSINESSES, SMALL\nAND LARGE, MAKING OUR COUNTRY A MAGNET FOR NEW JOBS.\nTHAT'S 15% DOWN FROM 35%. [ APPLAUSE ]\nINCOME TAXES WILL BE CUT DRAMATICALLY FOR THE WORKERS.\nWORKERS, AND I MEAN THE REALLY HARD WORKERS.\nYOU'RE PAYING TOO MUCH TAX, FOLKS.\nEVERYBODY KNOWS IT. SO FOR THE WORKERS, THE MIDDLE\nCLASS, FAMILIES, EVERYBODY, WE'RE HAVING A MAJOR, MAJOR TAX\nREDUCTIONS AND I WILL TELL YOU, IVANKA TRUMP WANTS CHILD CARE\nTAKEN CARE OF, AND WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT, OKAY.\nON MY FIRST DAY, IMMEDIATELY SEND ME A BILL TO REPEAL AND\nREPLACE OBAMACARE. [ APPLAUSE ]\nPREMIUMS IN OHIO HAVE INCREASED MORE THAN 80% SINCE OBAMACARE\nWAS PASSED. 80%.\nHAVE YOU NOTICED? IT'S NOT A PRETTY PICTURE,\nRIGHT? 80%.\nPREMIUMS HAVE GONE UP ALMOST $5,000 NATIONWIDE SINCE DWYANE.\nMORE THAN TWO-THIRDS OF OUR NATION'S COUNTIES AND THINK OF\nTHIS, HAVE LOST. EVERY DAY I'M READING ANOTHER\nONE LEFT, ALL THE BIG ONES, THEY'RE ALL LEAVING.\nIT'S FALLING ANYWAY, WE'RE GOING TO REPLACE AND TERMINATE IT.\nEVEN IF WE DIDN'T, IT'S NOT MAKING IT JUST SO YOU\nUNDERSTAND. WE'RE GOING TO REPLACE\nGOVERNMENT RUN BOEMTCARE WITH REFORMS --\n>> WE'RE GOING TO DIP INTO HILLARY CLINTON RIGHT NOW.\nSHE IS SPEAKING AT THE SAME TIME, BUT SHE IS ADDRESSING\nTHOSE RECENT SHOOTINGS. LET'S LISTEN INTO THAT FOR A\nMOMENT. >> POLICE OFFICERS IN\nPHILADELPHIA LAST WOKE AND LAST NIGHT IN CHARLOTTE, 12 OFFICERS\nWERE INJURED IN DEMONSTRATIONS FOLLOWING KEITH LAMONT SCOTT'S\nDEATH. EVERY DAY POLICE OFFICERS ACROSS\nOUR COUNTRY ARE SERVING WITH EXTRAORDINARY COURAGE, HONOR,\nAND SKILL. WE IS THAT TRUE AGAIN THIS\nWEEKEND IN NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY, AND MINNESOTA.\nOUR POLICE HANDLED THOSE TERRORIST ATTACKS EXACTLY RIGHT.\nAND THEY LIKELY SAVED A LOT OF LIVES.\nI'VE SPOKEN TO MANY POLICE CHIEFS AND OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT\nLEADERS WHO ARE AS DEEPLY CONCERNED AS I AM, AND DEEPLY\nCOMMITTED AS I AM TO REFORM. WHY?\nBECAUSE THEY KNOW IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE SAFETY OF OUR\nCOMMUNITIES AND OUR OUFRSS. WE ARE SAFER WHEN COMMUNITIES\nRESPECT THE POLICE AND POLICE RESPECT COMMUNITIES.\n[ APPLAUSE ] I'VE ALSO BEEN PRIVILEGED TO\nSPEND A LOT OF TIME WITH MOTHERS WHO'VE LOST CHILDREN AND YOUNG\nPEOPLE WHO FEEL THAT AS FAR AS THEIR COUNTRY'S CONCERNED, THAFR\nLIVES SEEM DISPOSABLE. WE'VE GOT TO DO BETTER.\nAND I KNOW WE CAN. AND IF I'M ELECTED PRESIDENT, WE\nWILL. AND WE WILL DO IT EXACTLY\nTOGETHER. WHICH IS THE ONLY WAY IT CAN BE\nDONE. LOOK.\nI KNOW I DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS.\nI DON'T KNOW ANYONE WHO DOES. BUT THIS IS CERTAIN, TOO MANY\nPEOPLE HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES WHO SHOULDN'T HAVE.\nSABRINA FULTON HAS BECOME A FRIEND OF MINE.\nHER SON, TRAYVON MARTIN -- >> OKAY.\nWE ARE LISTENING TO HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP BACK TO\nBACK THERE. SO WE TO WANT BRING IN OUR\nPOLITICAL PANEL FOR SOME QUICK REACTION TO WHAT WE HEARD SO\nFAR. A.J.DELGATTO, LES SI MARSHALL,\nSHE IS A FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR, THANKS TO BOTH OF YOU FOR\nJOINING US. LESLIE, LET ME START BE YOU, YOU\nHEARD HILLARY CLINTON, CLEVER. SHE'S PUTTING TOGETHER THE GOOD\nPOLICE WORK THAT WE SAW IN NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY OVER THE\nWEEKEND, AND AT THE SAME TIME PUTTING IT SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE\nOTHER THINGS WE'VE SEEN GOING ON WITH THE SHOOTINGS MORE RECENTLY\nIN THE PAST DAY OR SO. IS IT GOOD TO PUT THOSE TWO\nTHINGS TOGETHER TO KIND OF SHOW THAT SHE RECOGNIZES BOTH THE\nGOOD AND THE QUESTIONABLE AND THE MAYBE BAD?\n>> ABSOLUTELY. BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT VOTERS,\nESPECIALLY THAT POOL OF INDEPENDENTS, WHICH IS WHAT SHE\nOR DONALD TRUMP NEED TO GET THE VOTES ON NOVEMBER 8, YOU NEED TO\nSHOW THAT LOOK. I'M NOT POINTING FINGERS OF\nBLAME. WE HAVE SOME PROBLEMS ON THE\nSIDE OF THE POLICE. WE HAVE SOME PROBLEMS ON THE\nSIDE OF THE CITIZENS AND I LOVE THE FACT THAT SHE WAS HUMBLE\nWHEN SHE SAID SHE DID NOT HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS\nA VERY DIFFERENT TYPE OF CANDIDATE THAN DONALD TRUMP.\nI ALSO LIKE THE FACT THAT SHE BRINGS IN THE MOTHER ASPECT AND\nTHE PERSONAL ASPECT, THE HUMAN ASPECT.\nBECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE ALL WANT SAFER COMMUNITIES.\nSO I LIKED WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY. >> YEAH.\nA.J., LET ME TAKE YOU OVER TO DONALD TRUMP.\nYOU KNOW, HE SAID THAT HE HAS HIS AGENDA, ECONOMIC AGENDA CAN\nBE SUMMED UP WITH THREE BEAUTIFUL WORDS, JOBS, JOBS,\nJOBS, TALKING ABOUT THE NUMBER WE HEAR A LOT OF TIMES FROM\nTHINK TANKS ABOUT HOW MUCH REGULATION COSTS EVERY YEAR $2\nTRILLION SAYING HE WANTS TO TAKE THE CORPORATE TAX RATE DOWN.\nTHAT WOULD BRING JOBS IN. HE ALSO WANTS TO PROVIDE CHILD\nCARE, WHAT DID YOU THINK OF WHAT HE HAD TO SAY?\nDID HE HIT THE RIGHT NOTES. >> HE DID.\nI THINK IT'S ALSO VERY TELLING THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS IN A WAY\nKIND OF SLAMMING POLICE OFFICERS RIGHT NOW WHILE MR. TRUMP IS\nSPEAKING ABOUT JOBS. LISTEN, HE'S ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.\nWE HEAR BOTH CANDIDATES TALK ABOUT THE NEED TO STOP\nOUTSOURCING OF JOBS. DONALD TRUMP SPEAKS MORE ABOUT\nTHIS THAN HILLARY CLINTON. SHE'S ON RECORD SPEAKING OF IT\nFAVORABLY IN INDIA AT LEAST TWICE.\nHOW DO WE DO THAT? IT'S ONLY MR. TRUMP'S PLAN THAT\nCAN PROVIDE US A WAY TO DO THAT. HE'S TALKING ABOUT REGULATION,\nHOW MUCH THAT STIFLES COMPANIES ABILITY TO PRODUCE, TO\nMANUFACTURE HERE -- >> I MEAN --\n>> AND THE TAX RATE. THE CORPORATE TAX RATE HAS TO BE\nLOWER. IT'LL REDUCE --\n>> VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT THAT. I'M GOING TO ASK YOU BOTH TO\nSTAND BY FOR A SECOND. WE'RE GOING LISTEN BACK INTO\nDONALD TRUMP. HE'S TALKING ABOUT IMMIGRATION\nNOW, LET'S LISTEN. >> TERRORISM-RELATED ACTIVITIES.\nBAD ONES. THE STATE DEPARTMENT\nADMINISTRATES THE REFUGEE PROGRAM.\nHILLARY HAD THE CHANCE TO PUT THE NEEDED PROTECTIONS IN PLACE\nAND SHE DIDN'T DO IT. NOW SHE'S RUNNING.\nSHE'S GOING TO BE SO TOUGH. SHE'S GOING TO BE SO TOUGH.\nNOT GOING TO BE TOUGH. NOT GOING TO BE TOUGH.\nHILLARY CLINTON WON'T EVEN SAY THE WORDS RADICAL ISLAMIC\nTERRORISM. SHE WON'T SAY THE WORDS.\nHILLARY CLINTON, SHE TALKS TOUGH.\nABOUT MY SUPPORTERS. THAT'S WHAT SHE DOES.\nBUT SHE DOESN'T WANT TO THE TALK ABOUT ISLAMIC TERRORISTS.\nSHE CALLS THE PATRIOTIC AMERICANS WHO SUPPORT OUR\nCAMPAIGN MANY OF THEM COPS AND SOLDIERS, DEPLORABLE.\nAND IR REDEEMABLE. SHE WON'T USE THE SAME WORDS TO\nDESCRIBE ISLAMIC EXTREISTS WHO BELIEVE IN THE OPPRESSION OF\nWOMEN, GAYS, AND PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT FAITHS, BUT OUR\nPEOPLE, YOU, YOU, I GUESS ME, PROBABLY ME MORE THAN ANYBODY\nACCORDING TO HER. OUR PEOPLE, SHE HAS NO PROBLEM\nWITH. HILLARY CLINTON THINKS HARD\nWORKING, PATRIOTIC AMERICANS LIKE YOU ARE THE PROBLEM.\nSHE DOESN'T GET IT. AND SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND HOW\nDEMOCRACY WORKS, BELIEVE ME. PUBLIC SERVANTS ARE JUST THAT.\nTHEY'RE THERE TO SERVE YOU. THE EVER SERVED ARE THE SPECIAL\nINTERESTS AND HER DONORS. AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW HER\nCAMPAIGN, 50 TO ONE IN ADVERTISING.\n50 TO 1, AND I THINK WE'RE ACTUALLY WINNING.\nI ACTUALLY THINK WE'RE WINNING. 50-1.\nOUR CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT BREAKING UP THE SPECIAL INTERESTS KNOW\nMONOPOLY IN WASHINGTON, D.C. WE'RE TRYING TO DISRUPT -- THANK\nYOU. WE'RE TRYING TO DISRUPT THE\nCOLLUSION BETWEEN THE WEALTHY DONORS, THE LARGE CORPORATIONS,\nAND THE MEDIA EXECUTIVES. THEY'RE ALL PART OF THE SAME\nPOLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT. >> OKAY, LET'S SNEAK OUR PANEL\nBACK IN TO WHAT WE JUST HEARD. A.J., I'LL START WITH YOU.\nI MEAN, HE HIT ON THAT POINT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR AGAIN.\nSHE DOESN'T WANT TO DO ESSENTIALLY NAME-CALLING AS SHE\nCALLS IT WHEN IT COMES TO ISLAMIC RADICAL TERROR, BUT SHE\nWILL CALL HIS SUPPORTERS NAMES AS INDEPLORABLES.\nTHIS IS SOMETHING WE'LL HEAR FROM THE REST OF THE CAMPAIGN,\nDON'T YOU THINK. >> NOT JUST DEPLORABLES.\nAND IR REDEEMABLE. WHICH IS A HARSH WORD.\nWHEN WAS THE LAST TIME WE HEARD HILLARY CLINTON REFER TO\nTERRORISTS WITH THAT CHOICE OF LANGUAGE?\nAND MR. TRUMP IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT ON THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE,\nON NATIONAL SECURITY. IMMIGRATION IS A NATIONAL\nSECURITY ISSUE. IT'S A SAFETY ISSUE.\nIF YOU GO TO HILLARY CLINTON'S WEBSITE, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY\nNOTHING ON THERE ABOUT THE BORDER.\nABOUT EVEN VISA TRACKING WHICH ISN'T A CONTROVERSIAL POSITION.\nIT'S QUITE FRIGHTENING TO LIVING IN THIS DAY AND THAJ WE ARE\nEXPERIENCING TERRORISM ALMOST ON A WEEKLY, MONTHLY BASIS, THAT\nMISS CLINTON HAS SUCH LITTLE REGARD OR CONCERN IT SEEMS ABOUT\nIT. >> LESLIE, IT IS THIS IS\nSOMETHING WE'RE GOING HEAR TO THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN.\nSHE DESERVES HER NAME-CALLING FOR FOR HIS FOLLOWERS AND\nSUPPORTERS, THAT'S NOT A GOOD ANGLE.\n>> FIRST OF ALL, SHE'S",

JUST HIS CAMPAIGN CAME OUT WITH\nA CLARIFICATION AND SAYS HE WAS REFERRING TO THE SITUATION IN\nCHICAGO. >> YEAH.\nBUT THIS IS PROBLEMATIC, BECAUSE HIS WORDS -- IF YOU HAVE TO\nCLARIFY WORDS, EACH TIME THAT SOMEONE SPEAKS, IT CREATES\nPROBLEMS. AND WHEN YOU'RE PRESIDENT OF THE\nUNITED STATES, IT'S PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATICAL.\nSO LET'S SET THAT ISSUE ASIDE FOR A SECOND.\nI DON'T KNOW HOW DOMINANT THIS WILL BE IN THE DEBATE ON MONDAY.\nONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO YOU KNOW, I SIT WITH YOU ON A\nREGULAR BASIS, AND THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING HAPPENING THAT\nSEEMS AT THE MOMENT LIKE THE DEFINING ISSUE OF THE CAMPAIGN.\nAND THERE ARE VERY FEW REAL DEFINING ISSUES OF THE CAMPAIGN.\nSO WE'LL SEE MONDAY NIGHT WHAT SURFACES.\nBUT, ONE THING THAT -- ONE QUESTION I HAVE IS, DOES ANY OF\nTHIS IMPACT ON THE LEVEL OF INTEREST IN VOTING IN MINORITY\nCOMMUNITIES? BECAUSE ONE OF THE CHALLENGES\nFOR HILLARY CLINTON IS GOING TO BE TO GET THE KIND OF TURNOUT\nTHAT SHE NEEDS IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY, IN THE HISPANIC\nCOMMUNITY, SO IS THIS A GALVANIZING ISSUE FOR VOTERS\nTHERE OR NOT? >> HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THIS\nLINE OF UNITY, UNIFYING VERSUS PANDERING?\nON EACH SIDE. SO CLINTON COMES OUT AND SHE\nSAYS ON A SHOW THAT I'M GOING TO SPEAK DIRECTLY TO WHITE PEOPLE\nAND SAY THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE. THAT RAISED EYEBROWS, YOU KNOW,\nWHY SAY IT THAT WAY? IS THAT A WAY OF PANDERING TO A\nBLACK AUDIENCE SIMILARLY, YOU HAVE TRUMP WHO ON THE ONE HAND\nSAYS THAT THIS COP CHOKED, DID THIS COP CHOKE?\nWHICH IS OBVIOUSLY INCENDIARY AND GETTING BEFORE THE FACTS.\nTHEN HE SAYS THE THING ABOUT STOP AND FRISK.\nYOU KNOW. HE SEEMS TO BE HAVING IT BOTH\nWAYS. SHE SEEMS TO BE PLAYING A LITTLE\nBIT OF A SIMILAR GAME. NO?\n>> YEAH. YOU KNOW, THIS IS SUCH A\nVOLATILE QUESTION, CHRIS, THAT'S PROBABLY BEST RESOLVED OUTSIDE\nTHE CAULDRON OF A CAMPAIGN. WHAT'S REALLY NEEDED IS A BRIDGE\nBETWEEN COMMUNITIES. BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS THAT A LOT\nOF THESE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN VICTIMIZED BY EXCESSIVE\nFORCE ARE ALSO COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN VICTIMIZED BY\nEXCESSIVE CRIME. AND THEY NEED STRONG POLICING\nAND THEY NEED SECURITY BUT IT CAN'T HAPPEN IF THERE'S NO BOND\nOF TRUST. AND WHAT YOU NEED FROM LEADERS\nIS TO SPEAK TO THIS ISSUE, RATHER THAN TO TRY AND TAKE\nADVANTAGE OF ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER.\nAND, SO WE'LL SEE WHAT PEOPLE -- WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY IN THE\nCOMING DAYS. AND IF IT COMES UP IN THIS\nDEBATE. >> WELL LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT.\nALL EYES ON MONDAY NIGHT WHEN OBVIOUSLY IT WILL BE THE FIRST\nDEBATE. SOME PEOPLE PREDICT IT WILL BE\nTHE MOST WATCHED TV NEWS EVENT EVER, IF NOT TV EVENT ACTUALLY\nEVER. AND SO --\n>> YES. >> DOES THE NEWS CYCLE DICTATE\nWHAT WE WILL HEAR THERE I MEAN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT EVERY EVERY\nWEEK WE SEEM TO THINK THERE'S A NEW DEFINING MOMENT.\nTHIS IS ONE IN TERMS OF THE TENSION BETWEEN POLICE IN\nCOMMUNITIES THAT CERTAINLY KEEPS COMING UP OVER THE YEAR.\nSO, WILL THIS BE FRONT AND CENTER?\n>> YES, IT'S -- IT MAY -- IT MAY WELL COME UP, I'M CERTAIN THAT\nTHE INCIDENT -- THE TERRORIST ATTACK OF LAST WEEKEND WILL BE A\nENTREE INTO THAT DISCUSSION. THESE ISSUES WILL COME UP.\nBUT THE LARGER ISSUES THAT WILL BE RESOLVED OR THE LARGER\nQUESTIONS THAT ARE TO BE RESOLVED IN THIS DEBATE ARE THE\nQUESTIONS THAT CANDIDATES HAVE -- THAT VOTERS HAVE ABOUT\nTHE CANDIDATES, IS DOES DONALD TRUMP HAVE THE TEMPERAMENT AND\nDEPTH OF KNOWLEDGE TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nIS HILLARY CLINTON STRAIGHTFORWARD ENOUGH,\nCONNECTING ENOUGH WITH PEOPLE TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES. I DON'T THINK VOTERS ACTUALLY\nSCORE THESE DEBATES BASED ON ANSWERS ON ANY PARTICULAR ISSUE.\nBUT THEY DRAW IMPRESSIONS OF THE CANDIDATES FROM THESE DEBATES\nWHICH ARE PRESSURE FILLED TESTS, ORAL EXAMS, AND SO THEY'RE\nLOOKING AT THE TOTAL PACKAGE. HOW DO THESE CANDIDATES DEAL\nWITH THAT PRESSURE. HOW DO THEY RESPOND TO THESE\nQUESTIONS. NOT JUST IN TERMS OF THE\nSUBSTANCE, BUT IN TERMS OF THEIR BEARING.\nAND SO, YOU KNOW, I -- IT WILL BE REALLY, REALLY INTERESTING.\nAS YOU POINT OUT, THIS WILL BE THE TELEVISION EXTRAVAGANZA OF\nALL TIME. I'M SURE DONALD TRUMP HAS TAKEN\nGREAT PRIDE IN THAT BECAUSE HE'S BIG ON RATINGS.\nTHIS ONE'S GOING TO DO VERY WELL.\n>> WELL, LOOK, I MEAN IF IT SUGGESTS AN ENGAGEMENT WITH THIS\nRACE, WHICH I THINK IT DOES, AND WHICH WE'VE SEEN ALL YEAR,\nTHAT'S A GOOD THING. >> TRUE.\nHE SAID THIS MORNING IT IS -- THE QUESTION IS -- GO AHEAD,\nDAVID. GO AHEAD.\n>> GO AHEAD, CHRIS. >> NO --\n>> I WAS GOING TO SAY IT'S INTERESTING THAT WE EXPECT A\nLARGE AUDIENCE. BUT THE POLLING SHOWS A LACK OF\nGREAT ENTHUSIASM ABOUT THE RACE. >> YES.\n>> SO -- >> THAT IS A --\n>> WITH THESE RATINGS PORTEND A BIG TURNOUT, OR ARE PEOPLE\nWATCHING BECAUSE IT'S JUST KIND OF THAT YOU KNOW, LIKE THEY\nWOULD WATCH NASCAR OR SOMETHING TO SEE IF SOMEONE HITS A WALL.\n>> ALL RIGHT. DAVID AXELROD THANK YOU FOR THAT\nANALOGY AND FOR BEING HERE. BACK TO OUR -- OUR TOP STORY AND\nTHAT IS THE TRUTH ABOUT KEITH LAMONT SCOTT'S DEATH.\nIN THE HANDS OF POLICE IN CHARLOTTE.\nWILL THE CITY DECIDE TO RELEASE THE DASH CAM AND THE BODY CAM\nVIDEO THAT SHOWS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED DURING THAT DEADLY\nENCOUNTER?

HE REACTS QUICKLY.\nHE IS GOOD ON THE STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS.\nTHINGS COME TO HIS MIND. SHOULD SHE DUKE IT OUT WITH HIM\nIF HE STARTS GETTING TO BE A SMART ALEC?\n>> I THINK SHE HAS TO. FIRST OF ALL, IT IS WHAT HER\nBASE IS EXPECTING. WE'VE TALKED MILLION TIMES ABOUT\nTHE ENTHUSIASM AMONG DEMOCRATS. THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE HER GO ON\nTHE OFFENSIVE. >> HAS ANYBODY EVER BEAT TRUMP\nAT HIS GAME? I'M THINKING OF LITTLE MARCO AND\nSLEEPY HEAD JEB AND LOW ENERGY JEB.\nIF HE CAN GET YOU ON THE STREET CONNER DOING A LOT OF TRASH\nTALKING, THAT SEEMS TO BE HIS HOME.\n>> SHE CAN'T DO THE TRASH TALKING.\nSHE HAS TO GO ON THE ATTACK. WE SAW THIS, CHRIS, IF YOU LOOK\nAT HER PAST DEBATE PERFORMANCES. SHE DIDN'T JUST STAND BY AND NOT\nATTACK BERNIE SANDERS IN THE FIRST DEBATE.\nAND SHE CAME OUT QUITE SUCCESSFULLY AS WELL.\nSHE HAD THESE SURGICAL STRIKES ON ISSUES LIKE GUNS.\nESPECIALLY WHEN IT IS UNCLEAR HOW MUCH ACTUAL FACT CHECKING\nAND PUSH BACK THE MODERATORS THEMSELVES WILL BE DOING IN THIS\nDEBATE. I THINK HILLARY CLINTON HAS TO\nBE PREPARED TO DO THAT JOB HERSELF.\nOF COURSE THIS IS A CERTAIN RICK OF ATTACK TOO MUCH AND BEING\nOVERLY AGGRESSIVE AND ALLOWING TRUMP TO COUNTER PUNCH LIKE\nTHAT. IF HE STARTS NAME CALLING, I\nDON'T THINK THAT WILL PLAY AS WELL ON THIS DEBATE STAGE WHERE\nTHE ONLY OTHER OPPONENT IS A WOMAN THAN IT DID ON THIS ALPHA\nMAIL CAGE MATCH STAGE THAT WE SAW DURING THE REPUBLICAN\nPRIMARY. >> SO CHARLES, I GIVE THE\nQUESTION TO YOU. CAN YOU GO BACK AT HER EVEN\nTHOUGH SHE'S A WOMAN CANDIDATE. THE BIRTHER COMMENTS.\nHOW COME YOUR PEOPLE WERE OUT PUSHING IT FIRST?\nHOW TOUGH WOULD YOU BE WHACKING BACK IF YOU WERE TRUMP?\n>> I SUSPECT WE'RE GOING TO SEE A SOFTER DONALD TRUMP, AT LEAST\nAT THE BEGINNING OF THE DEBATE. IF HE IS WISE, HE WILL COME OFF\nAS TOO SHRILL. IF HE COMES OUT PUNCHING AWAY\nLIKE A RIGHT-WING FANATIC, HE SUCCEEDS BEST WHEN WE SEE THAT\nDONALD TRUMP THAT REVEALS THE CLEVER CRAFTY BUSINESSMAN WHO\nBUILT UP A FORTUNE WITH ONLY A MERE MILLION DOLLARS OR SO TO\nSTART WITH. AND WAS ABLE TO GET TO WHERE HE\nIS WHERE HE HAS DEFIED ALL PREDICTIONS AS FAR AS BEING ON\nTHE BRINK OF POSSIBLY WINNING THE WHITE HOUSE.\nTHIS IS A TIME WHEN HE IS BEST CONTROLLING HIS TEMPER AND\nSAVING HIS BEST VERBAL SHOTS, HIS BEST TRASH TALKING FOR OTHER\nKEY MOMENTS. >> THANK YOU.\nI'LL ASK YOU A TACTICAL QUESTION.\nIF YOU'RE HILLARY AND YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE TRUMP AN OPENING.\nYOU DON'T SLAM HIM, HE'LL COME BACK AND HIT YOU HARD AND YOU\nDON'T DEFEND YOURSELF. YOU SAY, I'LL DO A LITTLE\nROPE-A-DONE HERE, PEOPLE WILL REALIZE, HE IS JUST PUNCHING ME.\nHE'S GOT NOTHING POSITIVE TO SAY.\nPROTECT YOURSELF. PUT YOUR AMS UP AND GO AHEAD AND\nSAY, KEEP DOING THAT. PEOPLE WILL ONLY SEE DONALD\nTRUMP SMASHING AWAY AT ME AND AFTER A WHILE THEY'LL GO, THIS\nGUY IS A BULLY. SHE'S TALKING POSITIVELY AND\nHE'S DOING CHEAP SHOTS.

BUT I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO THE\nATTACKS ON REAL ISSUES LIKE POLICY, LIKE HER POLICY ON IRAQ\nOR SYRIA, THINGS LIKE THAT, SHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO COME BACK\nAND HAVE A PRETTY STRONG ANSWER ON THAT.\nIT'S WHEN HE GOES LOW TO THE PERSONAL STUFF.\nI DO THINK TO A CERTAIN EXTENT SHE MIGHT JUST LET HIM PLAY IT\nOUT. >> CAN YOU WIN THIS DEBATE BY\nNOT GOING LOW? AND TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE\nCOUNTRY? A REAL HARD FELT LOVE FOR YOUR\nCOUNTRY IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK YOU NEED TO DO TO GET THROUGH\nPROBLEMS. WITH A HEART FELT APPEAL BE AS\nIMPRESSIVE AS PUGILISTICS? >> IT IS INTERESTING, YOU TALK\nABOUT THE IMPRESSION. THIS IS A GAME OF IMPRESSIONS\nREALLY. THESE AREN'T DEBATES FOR ISSUE\nTO ISSUE. THAT WOULD PEOPLE TO SLEEP, AS\nIT WERE. BUT THAT IS HILLARY CLINTON'S\nSTRENGTH. AND DONALD TRUMP'S BIG WEAKNESS.\nIT'S NOT A WHOLE LOT ABOUT THE FACTS.\nBUT IF THE SMARTER PERSON AUTOMATICALLY WON, WE WOULD HAVE\nPRESIDENT GORE, PRESIDENT DUKAKIS.\nAS A MATTER OF FACT, THIS IS SOMETHING WHERE PEOPLE WANT TO\nKNOW IS THIS PERSON, IS HE OR HER ON MY SIDE?\nWILL THEY BE OUT THERE FIGHTING FOR ME AND MY INTERESTS?\nSO HOW WELL YOU COME OFF AS BEING A REAL PEOPLE PERSON CAN\nMAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE. >> I THINK THE TRUE PATRIOT.\nTHE PERSON THAT SHOWS THEY TRULY LOVE THIS COUNTRY WILL WIN THE\nDEBATE. I THINK YOU'LL SAY THAT PERSON\nIS MY HEART. WE'LL SEE.\nTHANK YOU. I SURPRISED YOU WITH THAT,\nDIDN'T I? UP NEXT, PICE SHOT AND KILLED\nAN AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN.

IT HAS NOT TO DO WITH\nHILLARY CLINTON, BUT I'M JUST NERVOUS.\nAT THE END OF THE DAY, I ASK WOULD I REAL BE ME OR MY\nOPPONENT? I WOULD RATHER BE\nHILLARY CLINTON AND HER CAMPAIGN RIGHT NOW.\nSHE IS AHEAD INLE POLL. >> SO ON THE MECHANICS OF A\nCAMPAIGN, SHE'S CONNECTING, HE'S NOT? I WOULD OPEN UP WITH --\n>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING OUT THERE.\nI WILL DEFER IT TO YOU AND MAKE POLITICO, BUT I DO THINK THAT\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS GOT MORE IMMEDIATE PROBLEMS DOMESTICALLY.\nTHAT'S GALVANIZING HER FORCES, ESPECIALLY WHEN THOSE WHO LIKE\nHER COMPLIMENT HER BEFORE LARGE CROWDS.\nCHARLIE CRIST, RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR IN FLORIDA, TAKE A\nLISTEN. >> THE THING I LIKE MOST ABOUT\nHER IS I BELIEVE SHE IS STEADY. I BELIEVE SHE IS STRONG.\nI BELIEVE HE IS HONEST, AND I LOOK FORWARD TO VOTING FOR HER.\n>> ALL RIGHT. NOW, POLITICS IS ALWAYS ABOUT\nSNIDE COMMENTS AND REACTIONS, BUT -- BUT THAT'S FLORIDA, A\nMUST-WIN STATE FOR HER, MAYBE NOT.\nWHAT DID YOU THINK? >> FLORIDA IS A VERY CLOSE RACE.\nBUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MACRO ENVIRONMENT, YOU JUST HAD IT IN\nTHE SEGMENT BEFORE ME, IT IS INDISPUTABLE THAT\nHILLARY CLINTON'S PATH TO THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS MUCH EASIER\nTHAN DONALD TRUMP'S -- >> YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT.\nI'M NOT DENYING THAT YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT HER PAST, IT'S STILL\nEASIER, BUT NOT AS EASY. ALL OF A SUDDEN IN ALTERNATES\nMORE THAN TWO OR THREE WEEKS, IT'S LIKE THAT EASY MATH HAS\nIMPLODED ON ITSELF. NOW, HE'S GOT A FIGHT, YOU'RE\nQUITE RIGHT. >> HE'S GOT IT DOWN TO LOW\nSINGLE DIGITS, WINNING SOME OF THEM NOW, AND THALGTS ASSIST\nMORE THAN 2 1/2 WEEKS, IS THAT A CASE OF YOUR CANDIDATE IMPLODING\nOR HIM JUST GETTING LUCKY? I THINK THIS ELECTION IS\nACTUALLY BEGINNING TO RESEMBLE THE OBAMA/ROMNEY ELECTION IN\n2012. YOU'RE ASKING A CERTAIN GRAVITY\nTHAT SETS IN, AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO HAVE THE SAME OUTCOME.\nI THINK HILLARY CLINTON WILL BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES, BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS -- WHICH MEANS YOU\nHAVE TO GO OUT AND EARN THE VOTES, KNOCKING ON DOORS, AND\nGOING ON THE AIR, AND THOSE ELEMENTS HAVE REALLY BEEN\nDEFICIENT, AND HILLARY CLINTON IS ON HER GAME.\n>> JUST FOR THE RECORD, YOU LIKE HILLARY CLINTON AND NOT\nDONALD TRUMP? >> YOU COULD SURMISE THAT.\n>> DULY NOTED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH,\nCONGRESSMAN.",

THE ECONOMIC NUMBERS WERE A\nLITTLE BIT BETTER WHEN THEY CAME OUT A FEW DAYS AGO.\nTHAT'S IT. IT'S THE REASON WHY SHE'S DUMPED\nALL THIS MONEY. OUT SPENT TRUMP BY AN\nUNBELIEVABLE AMOUNT.

WHAT IS THERE TO SAY?\nWHICH MEANS IN THE END THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE DEBATES IS\nGOING TO EXCEED THE IMPORTANCE OF ANY DEBATES IN ANY RACE THAT\nWE HAVE EVER SEEN. >> HE IS OUT AND ABOUT IN\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. LAST NIGHT HE SAID THIS ABOUT\nBLACK COMMUNITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY.\n>> REBUILD OUR INNER CITIES BECAUSE OUR AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nCOMMUNITIES ARE ABSOLUTELY IN THE WORST SHAPE THAT THEY HAVE\nEVER BEEN IN BEFORE, EVER, EVER, EVER.\n>> TODAY, HE WAS CAMPAIGNING AND WENT TO A CHURCH WITH DON KING\nWHO RAISED EYEBROWS IN WHAT HE SAID.\nTHE WORDS HE CHOSE.

WHAT ABOUT THIS OUTREACH?\nIS IT HAVING AN AFFECT, DO YOU THINK?\n>> I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO PLAY THAT.\nWE DON'T SEE ANY SIGNS IN THE POLLS IT'S HAVING AN AFFECT\nAMONG AFRICAN-AMERICANS. WHEN REPUBLICANS CAMPAIGN IN\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO SHOW IS\nTO MODERATE SUBURBAN VOTERS I'M NOT DIVISIVE, I'M NOT RACIST.\nI AM INCLUSIVE. BUT THE DON KING CHOICE WAS\nINTERESTING. DON KING WAS BARRED BY THE RNC\nFROM SHOWING UP AT THE CONVENTION BECAUSE HE IS A\nCONVICTED FELON. SERVED TIME FOR MURDER, I THINK,\nOR MANSLAUGHTER. HE NOT ONLY MADE A GAFF, BUT THE\nPICTURE WAS OF DONALD TRUMP LAUGHING AND A COUPLE WHITE\nPEOPLE LAUGHING IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN CHURCH.\nYOU SEE ONE AFRICAN-AMERICAN GUY HOLDING UP THE CELL PHONE.\n>> WE SHOULD POINT OUT HE CAMPAIGNED WITH HILLARY CLINTON\nAND SENATOR REED TWO YEARS AGO. >> THAT'S RIGHT.\nTHAT WAS A BAD CHOICE ALSO. I WOULD SAY THE OUTREACH EFFORT\nNOT SHOWING BIG RESULTS. BUT DONALD TRUMP MUST BE DOING\nSOMETHING RIGHT. HE IS COMING UP IN THE POLLS.\n>> THAT'S KIND OF -- THIS IS KIND OF ONE OF THE WAYS THAT\nDONALD TRUMP IS BREAKING ALL THE MOLDS IN POLITICS AND MAYBE\nIT'S -- CAUSED PEOPLE TO CRINGE. IT MIGHT NOT BE A TERRIBLE\nTHING. DON KING WAS TRYING TO BE -- HE\nWAS TRYING TO SORT OF BE DANGEROUS.\n>> SUCCEEDED. >> EXACTLY.\nAND THEN -- YOU KNOW, IF KANYE WEST HAD SAID THAT AT A RALLY\nFOR OBAMA, I DON'T THINK PEOPLE WOULD BE SO UPSET ABOUT IT.\n>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. STIRRING UP THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nCOMMUNITY, HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN OUT.\nWE WILL SEE THE PRESIDENT OUT MUCH MORE.\nWE ARE HEARING TWO DAYS A WEEK FROM NOW UNTIL ELECTION.\nIS THAT GOING TO FIRE THEM UP? CAN HE PASS THE BATON TO HER?\n>> YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN SAYING THIS A LONG TIME.\nHILLARY CLINTON IS GOING TO HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME RECREATING THE\nOBAMA COALITION. FIRST OF ALL, RACE AND GENDER\nPLAY DIFFERENTLY FOR GOOD REASONS AND FOR BAD.\nTHEY ARE DIFFERENT THINGS IN OUR CULTURE.\nHILLARY CLINTON IS A KNOWN QUANTITY.\nBARACK WAS A CHARISMATIC GUY. WHAT THEY WILL HAVE DO IF THEY\nARE GOING TO GIN UP NOT JUST THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN BUT THE\nMILLENNIAL VOTE, IS THEY HAVE TO DEMONIZE DONALD TRUMP EVEN MORE.\nTHE PROBLEM THERE IS THAT A LOT OF THAT STUFF JUST DOESN'T SEEM\nTO WORK BECAUSE PEOPLE PRICED IT INTO TRUMP.\nSOME PEOPLE THINK IT'S ALL FUN AND GAMES.\nOTHER PEOPLE TAKE IT SERIOUSLY. I DON'T KNOW THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON IS A GOOD MESSENGER FOR THAT.\nBARACK OBAMA MIGHT BE. >> LAST WORD HERE, NORTH\nCAROLINA IS UNIQUE. DEMOCRATS SEE AN OPENING THERE.\nTHERE'S THE TRANSGENDER BATHROOM BILL ISSUE.\nTHERE'S A HIGH LEVEL OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN SUPPORT FOR\nDEMOCRATS IN NORTH CAROLINA. NOW YOU HAVE THIS SHOOTING IN\nCHARLOTTE THAT IS OBVIOUSLY CAUSING A LOT OF CONTROVERSY\nDOWN THERE. >> GIVEN THE BUILT-IN ADVANTAGE\nYOU MENTION, THE FACT THAT SHE'S SLIPPING BEHIND IS OMINOUS FOR\nHER, ESPECIALLY AFTER ALL THE MONEY THAT SHE'S SPENT ON ADS.\nTHE RACE ISSUE, THE RIOTS, THE SHOOTINGS I THINK WILL PLAY.\nIT'S A VERY DELICATE ISSUE. IT CAN BE PLAYED BOTH WAYS IN\nTERMS OF WHO IT HELPS. TRUMP I THINK PROBABLY GETS THE\nADVANTAGE. PEOPLE HAVE A SENSE, WE THOUGHT\nTHERE WOULD BE AN IMPROVEMENT BUT THE DEMOCRATS AND\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN IN THE WHITE  YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL.\nIT CAN GO EITHER WAY. I'M NOT SURE THAT WILL TILT THE\nVOTE IN NORTH CAROLINA. I THINK IT IS MORE THE DEBATES\nAND JUST THE PERSONAL IMPRESSION THAT'S GOING TO BE LEFT.\nAND HERE HILLARY IS SETTING UP A DYNAMIC WHERE SHE KEEPS\nDEMONIZING TRUMP AND HE COMES OUT THERE AND HE SORT OF IS\nNORMAL. HE WINS.\n>> I JUST THINK THAT YOU CAN BE MISLED BY THE FACT THAT TRUMP\nHAD A GOOD TEN DAYS. ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL, YOU\nWOULD RATHER HAVE HILLARY CLINTON'S NUMBERS THAN DONALD\nTRUMP'S. SHE HAS THE BETTER PATH TO THE\nNOMINATION.",

IF I WERE ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN,\nI WOULD BE EXCITED. ONE QUESTION I HAVE IS IN THE\nFOUR-WAY RACE WITH JOHNSON AND STEIN, THAT'S 12% OF THE  ELECTORATE.\nNEITHER ARE IN THE DEBATES. IT DOES SEEM LIKE A LOT OF THEIR\nVOTES ARE COMING OUT -- BOTH OF THEIR VOTES ARE COMING OUT OF\nHILLARY'S SIDE. IF HALF, A QUARTER OF THEM\nREVERT BACK TO THE ANTI-TRUMP VOTE, THAT'S BAD NEWS FOR TRUMP.\nAT THE END OF THE DAY, I THINK IT'S A CONTEST BETWEEN TRUMP'S\nBASE OF ENTHUSIASM VERSUS HILLARY'S GROUND GAME.\n>> YOU KNOW, THE REASON SHE HASN'T SEIZED THE METHOD IS\nBECAUSE SHE DOESN'T HAVE A MESSAGE.\nWE SAW IT IN THAT AD. WHAT WAS THAT?\nI LIKE CHILDREN. I WILL FIGHT FOR CHILDREN.\nTHERE IS NEVER BEEN A MORE BENAL MESSAGE.\nSHE'S A CONTINUATION OF OBAMA WHO IS REASONABLY POPULAR.\nSHE HAS THAT ADVANTAGE. THE ECONOMIC NUMBERS WERE A\nLITTLE BIT BETTER WHEN THEY CAME OUT A FEW DAYS AGO.\nTHAT'S IT. IT'S THE REASON WHY SHE'S DUMPED\nALL THIS MONEY. OUT SPENT TRUMP BY AN\nUNBELIEVABLE AMOUNT. A RATIO OF FIVE TO ONE?\nFIVE TO ONE. IT LEAVES NO IMPRESSION.\nI THOUGHT THE MOST IMPRESSIVE OF ALL THE NUMBERS WAS CERTAIN OF\nYOUR CHOICE. THEY ARE BOTH OVER 90%.\n>> ALL THREE ARE IMPRESSIVE. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT.\nTHE FIRST ONE MOST IMPRESSIVE BECAUSE YOU GET TO SEE IT.\n>> IT'S GROWING IN IMPRESSIVENESS.\nYOGI SAID IT GETS LATE EARLY HERE.\nIT'S GETTING LATE EARLY, ESPECIALLY FOR HER.\nSHE'S BEEN KNOWN FOR 30 YEARS. HE HAS BEEN UBIQUITOUS ON THE\nAIR FOR 15 MONTHS. PEOPLE KNOW WHO THEY ARE.\nI'M NOT SURE WHAT HER ADVERTISING ADVANTAGE IS GOING\nTO AT THIS POINT. WHAT IS THERE TO SAY?\nWHICH MEANS IN THE END THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE DEBATES IS\nGOING TO EXCEED THE IMPORTANCE OF ANY DEBATES IN ANY RACE THAT\nWE HAVE EVER SEEN. >> HE IS OUT AND ABOUT IN\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. LAST NIGHT HE SAID THIS ABOUT\nBLACK COMMUNITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY.\n>> REBUILD OUR INNER CITIES BECAUSE OUR AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nCOMMUNITIES ARE ABSOLUTELY IN THE WORST SHAPE THAT THEY HAVE\nEVER BEEN IN BEFORE, EVER, EVER, EVER.\n>> TODAY, HE WAS CAMPAIGNING AND WENT TO A CHURCH WITH DON KING\nWHO RAISED EYEBROWS IN WHAT HE SAID.\nTHE WORDS HE CHOSE. A COUPLE OF JOKES FROM THE\nPASTOR THERE. WHAT ABOUT THIS OUTREACH?\nIS IT HAVING AN AFFECT, DO YOU THINK?\n>> I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO PLAY THAT.\nWE DON'T SEE ANY SIGNS IN THE POLLS IT'S HAVING AN AFFECT\nAMONG AFRICAN-AMERICANS. WHEN REPUBLICANS CAMPAIGN IN\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO SHOW IS\nTO MODERATE SUBURBAN VOTERS I'M NOT DIVISIVE, I'M NOT RACIST.\nI AM INCLUSIVE. BUT THE DON KING CHOICE WAS\nINTERESTING. DON KING WAS BARRED BY THE RNC\nFROM SHOWING UP AT THE CONVENTION BECAUSE HE IS A\nCONVICTED FELON. SERVED TIME FOR MURDER, I THINK,\nOR MANSLAUGHTER. HE NOT ONLY MADE A GAFF, BUT THE\nPICTURE WAS OF DONALD TRUMP LAUGHING AND A COUPLE WHITE\nPEOPLE LAUGHING IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN CHURCH.\nYOU SEE ONE AFRICAN-AMERICAN GUY HOLDING UP THE CELL PHONE.\n>> WE SHOULD POINT OUT HE CAMPAIGNED WITH HILLARY CLINTON\nAND SENATOR REED TWO YEARS AGO. >> THAT'S RIGHT.\nTHAT WAS A BAD CHOICE ALSO. I WOULD SAY THE OUTREACH EFFORT\nNOT SHOWING BIG RESULTS. BUT DONALD TRUMP MUST BE DOING\nSOMETHING RIGHT. HE IS COMING UP IN THE POLLS.\n>> THAT'S KIND OF -- THIS IS KIND OF ONE OF THE WAYS THAT\nDONALD TRUMP IS BREAKING ALL THE MOLDS IN POLITICS AND MAYBE\nIT'S -- CAUSED PEOPLE TO CRINGE. IT MIGHT NOT BE A TERRIBLE\nTHING. DON KING WAS TRYING TO BE -- HE\nWAS TRYING TO SORT OF BE DANGEROUS.\n>> SUCCEEDED. >> EXACTLY.\nAND THEN -- YOU KNOW, IF KANYE WEST HAD SAID THAT AT A RALLY\nFOR OBAMA, I DON'T THINK PEOPLE WOULD BE SO UPSET ABOUT IT.\n>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. STIRRING UP THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nCOMMUNITY, HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN OUT.\nWE WILL SEE THE PRESIDENT OUT MUCH MORE.\nWE ARE HEARING TWO DAYS A WEEK FROM NOW UNTIL ELECTION.\nIS THAT GOING TO FIRE THEM UP? CAN HE PASS THE BATON TO HER?\n>> YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN SAYING THIS A LONG TIME.\nHILLARY CLINTON IS GOING TO HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME RECREATING THE\nOBAMA COALITION. FIRST OF ALL, RACE AND GENDER\nPLAY DIFFERENTLY FOR GOOD REASONS AND FOR BAD.\nTHEY ARE DIFFERENT THINGS IN OUR CULTURE.\nHILLARY CLINTON IS A KNOWN QUANTITY.\nBARACK WAS A CHARISMATIC GUY. WHAT THEY WILL HAVE DO IF THEY\nARE GOING TO GIN UP NOT JUST THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN BUT THE\nMILLENNIAL VOTE, IS THEY HAVE TO DEMONIZE DONALD TRUMP EVEN MORE.\nTHE PROBLEM THERE IS THAT A LOT OF THAT STUFF JUST DOESN'T SEEM\nTO WORK BECAUSE PEOPLE PRICED IT INTO TRUMP.\nSOME PEOPLE THINK IT'S ALL FUN AND GAMES.\nOTHER PEOPLE TAKE IT SERIOUSLY. I DON'T KNOW THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON IS A GOOD MESSENGER FOR THAT.\nBARACK OBAMA MIGHT BE. >> LAST WORD HERE, NORTH\nCAROLINA IS UNIQUE. DEMOCRATS SEE AN OPENING THERE.\nTHERE'S THE TRANSGENDER BATHROOM BILL ISSUE.\nTHERE'S A HIGH LEVEL OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN SUPPORT FOR\nDEMOCRATS IN NORTH CAROLINA. NOW YOU HAVE THIS SHOOTING IN\nCHARLOTTE THAT IS OBVIOUSLY CAUSING A LOT OF CONTROVERSY\nDOWN THERE. >> GIVEN THE BUILT-IN ADVANTAGE\nYOU MENTION, THE FACT THAT SHE'S SLIPPING BEHIND IS OMINOUS FOR\nHER, ESPECIALLY AFTER ALL THE MONEY THAT SHE'S SPENT ON ADS.\nTHE RACE ISSUE, THE RIOTS, THE SHOOTINGS I THINK WILL PLAY.\nIT'S A VERY DELICATE ISSUE. IT CAN BE PLAYED BOTH WAYS IN\nTERMS OF WHO IT HELPS. TRUMP I THINK PROBABLY GETS THE\nADVANTAGE. PEOPLE HAVE A SENSE, WE THOUGHT\nTHERE WOULD BE AN IMPROVEMENT BUT THE DEMOCRATS AND\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN IN THE WHITE  YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL.\nIT CAN GO EITHER WAY. I'M NOT SURE THAT WILL TILT THE\nVOTE IN NORTH CAROLINA. I THINK IT IS MORE THE DEBATES\nAND JUST THE PERSONAL IMPRESSION THAT'S GOING TO BE LEFT.\nAND HERE HILLARY IS SETTING UP A DYNAMIC WHERE SHE KEEPS\nDEMONIZING TRUMP AND HE COMES OUT THERE AND HE SORT OF IS\nNORMAL. HE WINS.\n>> I JUST THINK THAT YOU CAN BE MISLED BY THE FACT THAT TRUMP\nHAD A GOOD TEN DAYS. ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL, YOU\nWOULD RATHER HAVE HILLARY CLINTON'S NUMBERS THAN DONALD\nTRUMP'S. SHE HAS THE BETTER PATH TO THE\nNOMINATION.",

NOW, HE -- UNLIKE IN FULL CA\nWHERE YOU CLEARLY HAD A BLACK MAN WHO WAS NOT ARMED AND SHOT\nAND KILLED BY A POLICE OFFICER, ALTHOUGH WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE A\nFACTS THERE EITHER, YOU HAVE TWO VERY DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS HERE OF\nWHAT HAPPENED TO KEITH SCOTT AND WHETHER OR NOT HE DID HAVE A GUN\nOR DID NOT AS SOME EYEWITNESSES SAY.\nI DETECT SOMETIMES THERE'S A NATURAL TENDENCY BY TOO MANY IN\nTHE PROFESSION TO SAY, WELL, THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF COPS\nOUT OF CONTROL, AND OTHERS SAY, WELL, THIS IS, YOU KNOW, THESE\nPEOPLE OFTEN HAVE CRIMINAL RECORDS, AND TO TRY TO PUT THE\nFAULT ON THEM. WE DON'T KNOW THE FULL STORY\nHERE, AND I DID SEE MORE RESTRAINT -- AT LEAST IN THE\nINITIAL COVERAGE -- THAN WE'VE SEEN IN SOME OF THESE OTHER\nCASES. I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING\nBECAUSE IT CAN LOOK VERY DIFFERENT EVEN FROM A PIECE OF\nVIDEO WHEN MORE EVIDENCE COMES IN.\nBILL: WE'RE ALL HOPING FOR THE BEST TONIGHT.\nHOWARD KURTZ FROM WASHINGTON, D.C., THANK YOU.\nMARTHA.

YEAH, SURE.\nALL THESE NUMBERS ARE OPEN TO INTERCEPTION.\nOUR MODEL SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THE UP SHOT'S MODEL.\nIF YOU COMPARE OUR MODEL AND UP SHOT'S MODEL WE SEE A TIGHTENING\nRACE. >> WHAT SEEMS TO ME IS WHEN YOU\nAGGREGATE IT ALL OUT, THINGS ARE PRETTY CLEAR.\nTHE RACE GETS TIGHTER DURING THE KA SEAR KHAN IT WAS CLEAR THE\nRACE WAS OPENING UP IN THE WAKE OF HER ALMOST FAINTING AT THE\n9/11, THE RACE HAS TIGHTENED. >> RIGHT.\n>> HERE'S WHAT'S FASCINAING TO ME NOW.\nNEW FOX NEWS POLLS. TRUMP UP IN NEVADA, NORTH\nCAROLINA, AND OHIO. A WORLD IN WHICH HILLARY CLINTON\nIS UP SIX POINTS NATIONALLY AND DOWN FIVE IN OHIO IS A HARD\nWORLD TO MAKE SENSE OF UNLESS SOMETHING VERY SIGNIFICANT IS\nHAPPENING IN A KIND OF REALIGNMENT SENSE OF WHAT'S\nHAPPENING IN THIS ELECTION. >> I THINK THERE ARE TWO THINGS\nAND YOU CAN SPLIT THE BABY IN TWO.\nI THINK OHIO HAS MOVED TO THE RIGHT COMPARED TO FOUR YEARS AGO\nBUT I ALSO THINK THAT PROBABLY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE LEADING\nBY FIVE IN OHIO AND DOWN SIX NATIONALLY AS IN THE NBC NEWS\nPOLL. YOU HAVE A MODEL AND WHAT YOU\nCOME OUT WITH IN A MODEL WHETHER YOU LOOK AT UP SHOT OR OUR OWN\nTHAN CLINTON IS AHEAD BUT BY A SHRINKING MARGIN.\n>> THERE'S A QUESTION OF WHAT STATES WILL PUT HER OVER THE\nTOP. THE REASON FOR THE NEW HAMPSHIRE\nPOLL IS LIKE BACK IN 2004, OHIO WAS EVERYTHING, RIGHT?\nTHIS TIME IF SHE HOLDS COLORADO, VIRGINIA, AND WISCONSIN, SHE CAN\nACTUALLY LOSE BOTH FLORIDA AND OHIO WHICH WAS NOT A SITUATION\nJOHN KERRY WAS IN BACK IN 2004. >> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.\nBARACK OBAMA DIDN'T NEED TO CARRY OHIO.\n>> QUICKLY, HERE'S 2012, FASCINATING.\nTHIS IS THE FINAL RCP AVERAGE, OBAMA OUTPERFORMING AN AVERAGE\nOF THREE POINTS. THAT'S A BIG DIFFERENCING,\nRIGHT? IS THAT TURNOUT BUMP IN YOUR\nMODEL OR IS THAT JUST ESSENTIALLY A QUESTION MARK?\n>> IT'S A QUESTION MARK. WE DON'T TRY TO PATROL WHICH WAY\nIT'S GOING TO GO. IT WAS REPUBLICANS WHO DID.\nWE'RE NOT TRYING TO GUESS WHICH WAY.\n>> RIGHT NOW YOUR MODEL IS NOT -- THAT DATA IS EXTERIOR TO THE\nMODEL, RIGHT? YOU'RE USING IT JUST OFF THE\nPOLLS. ITSELF COULD BE THE CASE FOR\nEITHER SIDE, RIGHT? >> RIGHT.\n>> THE OPERATION WHO SAW A GOOD TURNOUT PROBABLY NETTED THEM A\nBUNCH OF STATES. >> EXACTLY.\nI WOULD KEEP MY EYE ON NORTH CAROLINA, THE EARLY VOTING DATA\nCOMING FROM THERE. THE DEMOCRATS ARE DOING WELL.\nBUT IT'S EARLY. >> IT'S A SMALL SAMPLE BUT IT'S\nTHE FIRST HARD DATA WE'RE GETTING ON VOTES IN THIS\nELECTION.

THOSE ARE THE FOUNDATIONS OF\nHILLARY CLINTON'S STRENGTH. IT'S HEADING INTO THE DEBATE\nNEXT WEEK.

THE NUMBERS COME ALL NECK AND\nNECK, AND SOME SAY TRUMP HAS A LEGITIMATE CHANCE.\n>> HE STILL HAS A CHANCE, HOWEVER NOT ALL POLLS ARE\nCREATED EQUAL. OUR POLL, I'M BIASED BECAUSE I\nWORKED WITH IT FOR 25 YEARS. I THINK OUR POLL IS AMONG THE\nVERY SMALL NUMBER OF ELITE POLLS.\nSOME NATIONAL POLLS YOU CAN THROW OUT.\nSECONDLY, THE DAY-TO-DAY FLUCTUATIONS IN HEADLINES HAVE\nLESS EFFECT THAN WE TYPICALLY ASSIGN THEM.\nHILLARY CLINTON'S LEAD GOT TOO BIG.\nGOT BIGGER THAN COULD BE SUSTAINED.\nDONALD TRUMP HAD SOME REPUBLICANS COME HOME.\nOUR POLL IN THE TWO-WAY SHOWS HER LEAD DOWN FROM 9 TO 7.\nA SHRINKAGE. >> WHEN WERE THE POLLS?\n>> SEPTEMBER 16th TO 19th. THE LAST DAY OF POLLING WAS\nMONDAY. THE FIRST DAY WAS FRIDAY.\nWHAT ABOUT STATES LIKE OHIO, PENNSYLVANIA, FLORIDA?\nIF YOU LOOK AT THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE, THEY'LL MAKE ALL THE\nDIFFERENCE. >> DONALD TRUMP IS DOING WELL IN\nOHIO. HE'S LEADING MANY OHIO.\nHE'S VERY CLOSE IN FLORIDA. THAT LOOKS LIKE AN EVEN RACE.\nWE HAD A POLL THAT SHOWED THIS WEEK DONALD TRUMP BEHIND BY ONE\nIN FLORIDA. OTHERS HAVE SHOWN HIM AHEAD.\nTHREE POLLS YESTERDAY BY FOX SHOWED HIM LEADING NORTH\nCAROLINA, THOUGH THERE WAS A NEW ONE OUT THIS MORNING SHOWING HER\nAHEAD. NORTH CAROLINA, NEVADA, DONALD\nTRUMP HAD A LEAD AS WELL AS OHIO.\nHERE'S THE THING. BECAUSE OF THE PATTERNS OF\nSUPPORT WE'VE SEEN IN PAST ELECTIONS, DONALD TRUMP COULD\nWIN OHIO, FLORIDA, AND NEVADA AND STILL LOSE THIS RACE IF\nHILLARY CLINTON CAN WIN COLORADO AND VIRGINIA.\nTHERE WAS A POLL THAT SHOWED HILLARY CLINTON UP NINE IN NEW\nHAMPSHIRE. A NEW POLL OUT JUST A FEW\nMINUTES AGO THAT SHOWED HER UP NINE IN COLORADO.\nSHE'S GOT THE ADVANTAGE. NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.\nTHERE'S ALWAYS A QUESTION ABOUT MARGIN.\nTHERE'S A THREE-POINT ERROR MARGIN IN OUR POLL.\nNEVERTHELESS, SHE HAS GOT AN EDGE AND THIS SHOWS IT'S FAIRLY\nSTABLE. >> JOHN, THANK YOU FOR THIS.\nWE'LL CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION NOW.\nFOR MORE ON THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, LET'S BRING IN BEN\nWHITE, CNBC CONTRIBUTOR. WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT IN THAT\nPOLL AND IN MANY POLLS, WHAT HAS BEEN POLLED WHICH IS THE\nENTHUSIASM GAP, WHICH IS TO SAY WHO WILL SHOW UP AT THE POLL\nULTIMATELY. IT'S ONE THING TO TELL A\nPOLLSTER ON THE PHONE HOW YOU FEEL.\nIT'S ANOTHER TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE AND WAIT ON LINE.\n>> THAT'S TRUE. THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS TO\nCONTEND WITH THAT. HAS TO GET THEIR VOTE OUT.\nTHEY HAVE TO DRIVE UP BIG MARGINS IN URBAN AREAS,\nPARTICULARLY IN PLACES LIKE NORTH CAROLINA TO OVERCOME\nTRUMP'S STRENGTH. HE HAS MOTIVATED SUPPORTERS,\nPARTICULARLY IN RURAL AREAS WITH LESS EDUCATED WHITE VOTERS.\nA LOT OF THEM WILL TURN OUT. THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS WORKING\nHARD ON TURNOUT MODELS, WHAT THE ELECTORATE WILL LOOK LIKE AND\nGETTING THOSE PEOPLE TO THE POLLS.\nTHE ADVANTAGE SHE HAS THERE OVER TRUMP, SHE HAS MASSIVE\nORGANIZATION IN ALL OF THESE SWING STATES.\nHE DOESN'T. THEY HAVE MUCH MORE MONEY.\nTHEY HAVE A LOT MORE TV ADS ON THE AIR.\nIN ADDITION TO EVERYTHING JOHN TALKED ABOUT, ALL THOSE\nADVANTAGES, PARTICULARLY THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE WHICH TILTS IN\nHER FAVOR, THEY HAVE A STRUCTURAL ORGANIZATIONAL\nADVANTAGE. >> BASED ON JOHN'S POLL, DOES\nTHAT ASSUME HILLARY SURVIVED THE DEPLORABLES COMMENT?\n>> I THINK SHE SURVIVED IT. AND HE MADE THE POINT THAT A LOT\nOF THESE HEADLINES THAT PEOPLE IN THE MEDIA SAY THIS WILL SHIFT\nTHE RACE THAT WILL SHIFT THE RACE, THEY DON'T SHIFT THE RACE\nTHAT MUCH. WE HAVE A TRADITIONAL DEMOCRAT\nVERSUS REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, DESPITE ALL THE\nCRAZINESS. DESPITE ALL THE STUFF DONALD\nTRUMP SAYS. HE IS CLOSE, BUT NOT CLOSE\nENOUGH TO WIN. HER ADVANTAGE IS SUCH IN THE\nSTATES THAT GETTING OVER THE TOP WILL BE HARD FOR HIM.\n>> THIS ISSUE OF ENTHUSIASM OR WHAT PEOPLE CALL INTENSITY OF\nELECTORAL INTENTIONS, IT'S FASCINATING.\nIT'S SOMETHING THAT POLLSTERS CANNOT MEASURE ACCURATELY.\nIF YOU LOOK BACK AT THE BREXIT VOTE, IT CAN MATTER ENORMOUSLY.\nONE OF THE REASONS WHY BREXIT HAPPENED IS BECAUSE IT TURNED\nOUT THE PRO BREXIT CAMP WERE THAT MUCH MORE INTENSE AND\nCOMMITTED TO GETTING TO THE POLLS, EVEN ON A RAINY DAY.\n>> YOU HEAR A LOT FROM CLINTON SUPPORTERS ABOUT BREXIT AND ARE\nWE IN FOR A BIG SURPRISE LIKE BREXIT.\nI DON'T THINK WE ARE, PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE ORGANIZATIONAL\nADVANTAGE THAT DEMOCRATS HAVE. MAYBE THERE'S NOT THE SAME\nENTHUSIASM FOR CLINTON AS THERE WAS FOR OBAMA --\n>> JACK WELCH WAS ON EARLIER THIS WEEK.\nDID KELLYANNE CONWAY TWEET IT OUT?\n>> WAS A CNBC.COM ARTICLE. >> I CAN'T TELL YOU -- WHEN I\nTELL YOU THE RABID FOLLOWING TO WATCH WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT, IT\nWAS ASTONISHING TO ME IN TERMS OF THE ENTHUSIASM, WHICH I DON'T\nBELIEVE WOULD HAVE HAD HAD WE HAD A GUEST COME ON AND SAY\nSIMILAR THINGS ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON.\n>> THAT'S TRUE. HIS SUPPORTERS ONLINE --\n>> I'M NOT SAYING TWITTER IS REPRESENTATIVE.\nBUT IT SUGGESTS SOMETHING -- >> THERE'S AN INTENSITY THERE.\nNO QUESTION. NO QUESTION.\nHIS RALLIES ARE HUGE. HERS ARE NOT.\nHE HAS AN INTENSITY OF SUPPORT. WE DON'T KNOW THE EXTENT TO\nWHICH THAT WILL TRANSLATE INTO ELECTION DAY.\nGILLIAN IS RIGHT WE CAN'T TEST IT.\nTHERE'S AN UNKNOWN FACTOR THAT MAYBE THERE ARE SECRET TRUMP\nVOTERS WHO SHOW UP AND BLOW HER OUT IN PLACES LIKE PENNSYLVANIA.\n>> IN MORNING MONEY THIS IS ABOUT ELIZABETH WARREN AND HOW\nFAR LEFT SHE CAN PULL HILLARY CLINTON.\nSHE SAID SHE IS WARNING ON WALL STREET PICKS THIS REVOLVING DOOR\nISSUE, YOU SAY IF YOU GET INTO OFFICE THERE WILL BE NOBODY FROM\nTHE FINANCIAL SECTOR -- >> IS ALLOWED.\n>> I FIND THIS ODD. >> DO YOU WANT EXPERTS?\n>> THIS IS THE HEART SURGEON ARGUMENT.\nYOU'RE HAVING HEART SURGERY, YOU'RE NOT GOING A PSYCHOLOGIST.\n>> THERE'S ALSO THE ARGUMENT THAT PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE\nINDUSTRY SOMETIMES ARE TOUGHER ON IT THAN PEOPLE WHO NEVER\nWERE. GARY GINSLER IS A PERFECT\nEXAMPLE OF THAT. HE'S A HERO ON THE LEFT.\nHE WAS AT GOLDMAN FOREVER. BUT SHE WILL PUT PRESSURE ON\nPEOPLE LIKE LARRY FINK, BECAUSE THEY WORKED IN THESE PLACES THEY\nON A BLACK LIST. >> I KNOW THEY'RE PLAYING THE\nMUSIC. DONALD TRUMP TALKING ABOUT HIS\nSUPPORT FOR STOP AND FRISK AT THE SAME TIME THAT HE IS\nCOURTING THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE.\nHOW DOES THAT WORK? >> BADLY.\nIT'S NOT GOING TO WORK OUT WELL FOR HIM.\nHIS AFRICAN-AMERICAN OUTREACH IS QUESTION THE PRESIDENT'S BIRTH,\nTALK ABOUT STOP AND FRISK THIS WON'T TAKE HIM FROM THE 1% WHERE\nHE IS RIGHT NOW WITH AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND MAY TAKE\nHIM TO ZERO.",

AND IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS WE\nLET 4 MILLION WOMEN FALL INTO POVERTY.\nTHAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD BE SCARED OF WHICH IS THE STATUS QUO WHICH\nIS WHAT HILLARY CLINTON IS PROMISING US.\n>> CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE TEMPERAMENT ISSUE?\nI HAVE TO IMAGINE THERE ARE COMMENTS THAT HE HAS MADE DURING\nTHIS CAMPAIGN THAT YOU WOULD NOT BE PROUD TO SAY OUT OF YOUR\nMOUTH. >> HE'S A DIFFERENT PERSON.\nI'M A DIFFERENT PERSON. HE'S HAD A BUSINESS CAREER\nTHOUGH. AND LOOK AT THE STARK CONTRAST\nBETWEEN THESE TWO CANDIDATES. ON THE ONE HAND WE'VE GOT A\nPERSON WHO'S A DERIVATIVE OF THE POLITICAL BUBBLE WHO IN SOME\nCASES IN MY MIND BELIEVES SHE'S ABOVE THE LAW.\nTHEN AN OUTSIDER GUY, A BUSINESS GUY WHO'S BEEN A FIGHTER HIS\nENTIRE CAREER AND IS LISTENING TO THE PEOPLE BACK HOME.\nI THINK WE'VE GOT A STARK CONTRAST OF TWO INDIVIDUALS.\nI'M EXCITED ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN OVER THE NEXT FEW\nWEEKS. >> WOULD YOU DO BUSINESS WITH\nDONALD TRUMP? >> I HAVE, ABSOLUTELY I WOULD.\n>> YOU HAVE AND YOU DID. >> YES.\nTHIS IS A GUY IN THE REAL WORLD. THIS IS WHAT WASHINGTON MISSES.\nPEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IN WASHINGTON, NEVER BEEN IN THE\nENTERPRISE WORLD IN THE REAL WORLD HAVE NO CLUE IN WHAT'S\nHAPPENING IN CAPITAL EMPLOYEEING PEOPLE.\n>> DO YOU THINK IT WAS A MISTAKE FOR MACY'S TO STOP DOING\nBUSINESS WITH HIM? >> I'M SORRY.\n>> DO YOU THINK IT WAS A MISTAKE FOR MACY'S, FOR EXAMPLE --\nTHERE'S A LIST OF COMPANIES THAT STOPPED DOING BUSINESS WITH\nDONALD TRUMP FOR DOING -- >> MACY'S SAID IT WAS BECAUSE HE\nWAS RUNNING FOR CAMPAIGN. >> THAT'S PART OF IT.\n>> I THINK WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO DO IS LOOK AT EACH SITUATION.\nTHE BIGGER PICTURE HERE -- >> SOME WAS THE INFLAMMATORY\nLANGUAGE. NBC UNIVERSAL STOPPED BECAUSE OF\nTHE INFLAMMATORY LANGUAGE. >> THAT'S THEIR DECISION.\nIF YOU NEED SOMEBODY TO GET THIS COUNTRY GOING, MANY THINK\nREREALLY -- THEY'RE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR OWN\nSECURITY. IF YOU LOOK AT THE NATIONAL\nSECURITY SITUATION, THE TWO GO HAND IN GLOVE.\nBECAUSE OF AUR DEBT SITUATION WE'RE NOT REALLY ABLE TO DEFEND\nOUR COUNTRY THE WAY WE NEED TO RIGHT NOW.\nI THINK DONALD TRUMP IS TALKING ABOUT GETTING THE ECONOMY GOING\nAND DEVELOPING A LONG-TERM STRATEGY TO BECOME RESPONSIBLE\nAGAIN FINANCIALLY. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE DEBT\nBECAUSE THE COMMITTEE FOR A RESPONSIBLE FEDERAL BUDGET, THIS\nIS THE GROUP. THE BIPARTISAN GROUP THAT HAD\nBEEN GOING AROUND TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO COME TO THE TABLE AND\nDEAL WITH THAT THEY SAY LOOKING AT THE LATEST NUMBERS CLINTON\nHAS RELEASED AND THE NUMBERS THAT TRUMP HAS RELEASED, THEY'RE\nNOW EXPECTING THAT CLINTON'S PLANS WOULD BE OVER THE CURRENT\nLAW LEVELS. THEY WOULD NOW, THAT'S DOWN FROM\nWHAT THEY WERE EXPECTING BEFORE. WHAT DO YOU THINK WHEN YOU SEE\nNUMBERS LIKE THAT THAT ARE ASSESSED AND TOSSED AROUND?\n>> SEE, THE MEDIA LOOKS AT NUMBERS LIKE THAT AS ABSOLUTE.\nI'M A BUSINESS GUY. I UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN\nYOU ADJUST THE TAX RATES, WHEN YOU GET AFTER REGULATION, THEN\nYOU UNLEASH THIS ENERGY BOOM. WHAT AN EFFECT THAT WILL HAVE ON\nTHE ECONOMY. THAT'S A FORECASTING MODEL I'M\nNOT SURE I AGREE WITH THESE PEOPLE WITH AN INCREASE.\n>> IT'S HARD -- GRANTED, IT IS REALLY HARD WHEN YOU LOOK AT\nDYNAMIC SCORING AND SAY, YOU KNOW, I'M GOING TO GET 5.5%\nGROWTH OF GDP WHICH IS QUITE A BIT HIGHER THAN WE'VE SEEN FOR A\nVERY LONG TIME. YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE LOWEST GDP\nWE'VE SEEN IN YEARS RIGHT NOW. OBVIOUSLY REGULATORY STRIPPING\nAWAY SOME OF THAT WOULD PROBABLY HELP.\nA LOT OF THESE THINGS TO UNLEASH IT.\nBUT IT'S HARD TO COME UP WITH A WAY TO SCORE THE GROWTH YOU'RE\nGOING TO GET OUT OF THESE THINGS.\n>> OF COURSE IT IS. >> REMEMBER WHEN RONALD REAGAN\nCUT TAXES IN THE '80s. NOBODY THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD\nIDEA AND IT WORKED. WE HAVE THE HIGHEST CORPORATE\nTAX RATE BOTH NOMINAL AND EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN THE WORLD.\nWE KNOW WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT.\nWE'VE GOT A LOT OF REGULATIONS RIGHT NOW THAT ARE SUCKING THE\nVERY LIFE OUT OF OUR ECONOMY. WE KNOW WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH\nTHAT. WHAT HILLARY CLINTON IS TALKING\nABOUT IN HER MODEL IS BASICALLY A CONTINUATION OF THESE FAILED\nPOLICIES WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST EIGHT YEARS.\nTHE LAST THING THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY WANTS TO SEE IN MY\nOPINION IS A CONTINUATION OF THIS ENVIRONMENT THAT FRANKLY IS\nSHUTTING US DOWN. LET ME PUT OUT A WARNING HERE.\nWE DON'T TALK ABOUT THIS A LOT, BUT CHINA RIGHT NOW HAS A LARGER\nECONOMY. WHEN YOU HAVE PARITY THAN THE\nUNITED STATES. THEY'RE INFORMSING $300 MILLION\nIN THEIR MILITARY WHICH ON PAPER IS HALF OF WHAT WE'RE SPENDING.\nBUT THEY'RE ABOUT THE SAME AS WE ARE.\nWE'RE MOVING INTO A SITUATION WHERE CHINA COULD DO TO US OVER\nTHE NEXT DECADE WHAT WE DID TO THE SOVIET UNION AND THAT IS\nBANKRUPT THEM TRYING TO DEFEND THEIR COUNTRY.\nI THINK WE'RE IN A DANGEROUS TIME RIGHT NOW.\nI REALLY WANT SOMEBODY IN THE WHITE HOUSE WHO UNDERSTANDS OUR\nFREE ENTERPRISE SYSTEM AND WANTS A DIFFERENT DIRECTION FOR OUR\nCOUNTRY. >> SENATOR PERDUE, THANK YOU FOR\nYOUR TIME TODAY.",

TWO MINUTES AFTER THE TOP OF THE\nHOUR, LET'S BRING IN DONALD TRUMP.\nHE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nHE HAS A A DEBATE IN A COUPLE OF NIGHTS.\nGOOD MORNING. >> GOOD MORNING.\n>> AS YOU LOOK WHAT HAPPENED DOWN IN CHARLOTTE, WHAT ARE YOUR\nTHOUGHTS? >> IT'S WOW, HERE WE GO AGAIN.\nIT'S VERY SAD. IT'S VERY DIVIDED, OUR COUNTRY,\nAND IT'S GETTING WORSE, SO I'M NOT OVERLY SURPRISED TO SEE IT,\nBUT IT'S HAPPENING. >> WHY DO YOU THINK IT'S GETTING\nWORSE? >> IT JUST SEEMS THAT THERE'S A\nLACK OF SPIRIT BETWEEN THE WHITE AND THE BLACK.\nI MEAN, IT'S A TERRIBLE THING THAT WE'RE WITNESSING.\nYOU ARE SEEING IT. I'M SEEING IT, AND YOU LOOK AT\nWHAT WENT ON LAST NIGHT IN CHARLOTTE, A GREAT PLACE, AND\nYOU JUST SEE IT. THERE'S SOMEWHAT -- AND I SEE IT\nEVEN GOING OUT. THERE'S SUCH A LACK OF --\nTHERE'S A LACK OF SPIRIT. THERE'S A LACK OF SOMETHING,\nSOMETHING THAT'S GOING ON THAT'S BAD AND WHAT'S GOING ON BETWEEN\nPOLICE AND OTHERS IS GETTING WORSE.\n>> MR. TRUMP, WHAT WOULD THE MESSAGE BE OF A PRESIDENT TRUMP\nTO THESE RIOTERS, TO THE ANTI POLICE PROTESTERS.\n>> YOU HAVE TO HAVE LAW AND ORDER, AND AT THE SAME TIME YOU\nHAVE TO HAVE A CERTAIN SPIRIT AND UNITY.\nTHERE'S NO UNITY. YOU LOOK AT THE LEVEL OF HATRED,\nTHE ROCKS BEING THROWN AND EVERYTHING HAPPENING.\nIT'S SO SAD TO SAY. YOU KNOW THIS IS THE UNITED\nSTATES OF AMERICA, IT'S SO SAD TO SEE.\nTHERE'S NO UNITY. THERE HAS TO BE A UNITY MESSAGE\nTHAT HAS TO GET OUT AND IT STARTS WITH LEADERSHIP.\n>> MR. TRUMP, DON'T YOU THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A DIALOGUE, A\nDIALOGUE BETWEEN THE POLICE AND THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY HELP\nKEEP THE LAWS IN? YOU CAN'T ROLL UP WHEN THERE'S\nTROUBLE. YOU GOT TO HAVE A DIALOGUE WITH\nTHE FOLKS EVERY DAY. >> WELL, THAT'S TRUE IF YOU LOOK\nAT DALLAS, THERE WAS A DIALOGUE, THEY PROVIDED HIM RECEIVES --\nTHEMSELVES ON DIALOGUE, AND THEY WERE CONSTANTLY TALKING AND\nMEETING AND HAVING COMMUNITY GROUPS AND THAT WAS A PRETTY\nTOUGH SITUATION TO PUT IT MILDLY, A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE\nSITUATION. SO YOU KNOW THAT SOUNDS GOOD.\nIT SOUNDS RIGHT, BUT THERE'S SOMETHING DEEPER THAN THAT.\n>> I WAS GLAD TO KNOW THAT YOU HAD A DIALOGUE WITH HUNDREDS OF\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY LEADERS.\nYOU HAD THAT YESTERDAY. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO AIR LAST\nNIGHT, AND THEN -- FOR HANNITY FOR THE TOWN HALL, HANNITY\nDIDN'T AIR THAT BECAUSE HE WAS LIVE ON HIS SHOW FOR TWO HOURS\nLAST NIGHT. IT'S GOING TO AIR LAST NIGHT.\nWHAT WAS THAT DIALOGUE LIKE? BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR --\nIT'S EASY FOR US TO SAY WHAT WE NEED TO DO AS WHITE INDIVIDUALS.\nWE'RE SITTING ON THIS COUCH. BUT WHAT IF THE BLACK COMMUNITY\nWANT FROM THE WHITE COMMUNITY? HOW CAN WE WORK TOGETHER AS A\nCOUNTRY? >> WELL, WE WENT TO CLEVELAND\nAND IT WAS REALLY BEAUTIFUL. PASTOR DARREL SCOTT WHO WAS A\nGREAT GUY, HIS CHURCH. WE HAD A TREMENDOUS GROUP OF\nPEOPLE THERE, IT WAS AMAZING. IT WAS GOING TO BE ON HANNITY\nLAST NIGHT, BUT UNFORTUNATELY THIS PREEMPTED IT.\nIT WILL BE ON TONIGHT. IT WAS AN AMAZING COUPLE OF\nHOURS THAT WE SPENT AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, SOMETHING THAT\nCAN HAPPEN FAST AND IT CAN HAPPEN THAT'S VERY GOOD BUT\nRIGHT NOW THERE'S NOT -- THAT'S NOT TAKING PLACE.\nTHERE WAS GREAT LOVE IN THAT ROOM YESTERDAY.\nYOU SEE PICTURES OF IT. YOU SEE IT ON THAT SHOW.\nTHERE WAS A VERY FEELING IN THAT ROOM.\nSOMETHING CAN HAPPEN WITH THE RIGHT LEADERSHIP.\n>> I KNOW, I READ A REPORT THAT APPARENTLY THERE IN THAT BLACK\nCHURCH IN CLEVELAND YOU WERE ASKED WHAT WOULD YOU DO ABOUT\nBLACK ON BLACK CRIME, YOU SAID MAYBE IT'S TIME TO BRING BACK\nSTOP AND FRISK. INSTEAD OF CRITICIING NEW YORK\nPOLICE CHIEF RAY KELLY. >> NEW YORK WAS NOT A CHICAGO\nSITUATION, BUT IT WAS REALLY IN TROUBLE.\nWITH ALL THE SHOOTINGS AND EVERYTHING, RUDELY JEWELALLY --\nRUDY GIULIANI DID A GREAT JOB, AND MAYOR BLOOMBERG, THEY STOP\nIT. STOP AND FRISK WORKED.\nWE HAD TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF SHOOTINGS.\nNOW CHICAGO WAS OUT OF CONTROL. I WAS REFERRING TO CHICAGO STOP\nAND FRISK. THEY ASKED ME ABOUT CHICAGO.\nI WAS ASKING ABOUT STOP AND FRISK FOR CHICAGO.\nTHEY HAD 3,000 FROM JANUARY 1st. YOU CAN'T LET THE SYSTEM GO THE\nWAY IT'S GOING BUT I SUGGESTED STOP AND FRISK AND SOME PEOPLE\nTHINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA AND SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT, BUT WHEN\nYOU HAVE 3,000 PEOPLE SHOT AND SO MANY PEOPLE DYING, IT'S WORSE\nTHAN SOME OF THE PLACES WE'RE HEARING ABOUT LIKE AFGHANISTAN,\nYOU KNOW, THE WAR-TORN NATIONS. IT'S MORE DANGEROUS.\n>> IT DOES SOUND, MR. TRUMP, THAT CHICAGO I THINK I READ BS\n1,000 POLICE OFFICERS, YOU GOT MORE COPS ON THE STREETS.\nUNLESS YOU GET THEM THE TOOLS, WHAT DO YOU DO?\n>> I THINK CHICAGO NEEDS STOP AND FRISK.\nPEOPLE CAN CRITICIZE ME IF THEY LIKE.\nWITH GOOD, STRONG, LAW AND ORDER.\nYOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. IT CAN'T CONTINUE THE WAY IT'S\nGOING. >> CAN YOU EXPLAIN IT TO WHAT IT\nIS TO MY FOLKS DOWN IN SOUTH CAROLINA?\n>> YOU HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS. YOU HAVE SOMEBODY COMING UP WHO\nIS THE EXPERT ON IT BUT BASICALLY THEY WILL -- IF THEY\nARE PROACTIVE AND THIS SEE A PERSON POSSIBLY WITH A GUN OR\nTHEY THINK MAY HAVE A GUN, THEY WILL SEE THE PERSON AND THEY\nWILL LOOK AND THEY WILL TAKE THE GUN AWAY.\nTHEY WILL STOP, THEY WILL FRISK, AND THEY WILL TAKE THE GUN AWAY\nAND THEY WON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO SHOOT WITH.\nHOW IT'S NOT BEING USED IN CHICAGO IS -- TO BE HONEST WITH\nYOU, IT'S QUITE UNBELIEVABLE, AND YOU KNOW THE POLICE, THE\nLOCAL POLICE, THEY KNOW WHO HAS A GUN WHO SHOULDN'T BE HAVING A\nGUN. THEY UNDERSTAND THAT.\n>> STOP AND FRISK FOR THE MOST PART IS WHEN YOU GIVE COPS MORE\nPOWER TO QUIZ PASSERSBY? >> IN NEW YORK, THE NUMBERS WERE\nUNBELIEVABLY CHANGED. NOT JUST A A LITTLE BIT.\nIT WAS MASSIVELY CHANGED. IT BECAME FROM A SAFE CITY.\nFROM AN UNSAFE CITY TO A SAFE CITY.\n>> YOU MUST HAVE BEEN PLEASED TO SEE A SET OF THREE NEW FOX POLLS\nCOMING OUT OF THE BATTLEGROUND STATES OF NEVADA, AND OHIO, AND\nNORTH CAROLINA. IN NEVADA YOU LEAD 43 TO 40 AND\nIN OHIO, HOLDING AT 43 TO 37 AND YOUR REACTION TO WHAT APPEARS TO\nBE A VERY STRONG SURGE IN THESE IMPORTANT STATES?\n>> IT'S GREAT. I FEEL REALLY GOOD ABOUT THAT.\nI SAW THAT LAST NIGHT. I'M SPENDING A LOT OF TIME IN\nNORTH CAROLINA, OHIO, NEVADA, FLORIDA, DIFFERENT PLACES.\nWE'RE DOING WELL IN FLORIDA ALSO.\nREALLY GOOD. I THINK WE'RE DOING WELL IN NEW\nHAMPSHIRE. I WAS UP THERE A LOT AND WE SEEM\nTO REALLY RESONATE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.\nIT'S A GREAT PLACE, SO I THINK -- OVERALL, I THINK WE'RE\nDOING VERY WELL. >> MR. TRUMP, COMING UP ON\nMONDAY NIGHT ON ALL THE CHANNELS WILL BE THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL\nDEBATE. I NOTE IN THE MEDIA THEY HAVE\nBEEN TALKING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE MODERATOR, IN THIS CASE,\nLESTER HOLT, SHOULD HE BE A MODERATOR AND ASK QUESTIONS OR\nSHOULD HE BE A FACT CHECKER AND IF SOMEBODY SAYS SOMETHING THAT\nHE THINKS IS WRONG, HE WILL INTERRUPT AND CORRECT IT.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK? >> I THINK HE HAS TO BE A\nMODERATOR. IF HE SHE MAKES A MISTAKE OR I\nMAKE A MISTAKE, WE'LL TAKE EACH OTHER.\nI CERTAINLY DON'T THINK YOU WANT CANDY CROWLEY AGAIN.\n>> SHE WAS WRONG. >> I REALLY DON'T THINK THAT YOU\nWANT THAT. THAT WAS A PIVOTAL MOMENT IN\nTHAT DEBATE AND IT REALLY THREW THE DEBATE OFF AND IT WAS\nUNFAIR. SO I DON'T THINK YOU WANT THAT.\nNO, I THINK YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMEBODY THAT'S JUST LET'S THEM\nARGUE IT OUT AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF PRESSURE ON LESTER.\nI THINK LESTER IS A VERY GOOD PERSON, A VERY GOOD MAN.\nI THINK THERE'S A LOT OF PRESSURE ON HIM BECAUSE OF MATT\nLAUER. WHEN I HAD THETON HALL --TON\nTOSH TOWN HALL WITH MATT LAUER, I DID VERY WELL.\nTHEY WENT AFTER MATT LAUER. I THINK MY QUESTIONS WERE HARDER\nTHAN HER QUESTIONS, IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH, AND A LOT OF\nPRESSURE IS BEING PUT ON LESTER HOLT, AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S BOBBY\nKNIGHT-TYPE PRESSURE WITH THE REFs.\nTHAT'S WHAT THEY ARE DOING WITH LESTER HOLT.\nTHAT'S VERY UNFAIR. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WATCHING TO\nSEE IF HE SUCCUMBS. >> THERE ARE TWO PRESIDENTIAL\nDEBATES. >> THREE.\n>> THE FOURTH ONE IS THE VICE-PRESIDENTIAL.\n>> FOUR. >> WHO IS DOING THE ONE IN THE\nMIDDLE? >> ANDERSON COOPER AND YOU HAVE MARTHA.\n>> MR. TRUMP IS GOING TO STICK AROUND THROUGH THIS COMMERCIAL\nBREAK AND HE'S GOING TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU'VE GOT ABOUT\nTHE DEBATE AHEAD OF MONDAY'S SHOWDOWN.\nYOU CAN EMAIL AT FOX AND",

              "text": ">>> THE ISSUE OF CRIME AND\nPOLICING NOW AT THE FOREFRONT THIS MORNING OF THE 2016\nCAMPAIGN FOLLOWING POLICE SHOOTINGS IN CHARLOTTE AND\nTULSA. DONALD TRUMP FAVORS STOP AND\nFRISK. HE CALLS THE CONTROVERSIAL\nPOLICY UNDER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR GIULIANI AN UNQUALIFIED SUCCESS.\nTHE CURRENT MAYOR DOES NOT AGREE.\nMAYOR BILL DE BLASIO ENDORSES HILLARY CLINTON FOR PRESIDENT.\nLET'S TALK ABOUT THE VIOLENCE WE SAW OVERNIGHT.\n>> VIOLENCE IS NEVER ACCEPTABLE, LET'S BE CLEAR.\nPEOPLE WANT TO PEACEFULLY PROTEST, THAT'S THEIR RIGHT.\nLET'S GO TO THE UNDERLYING CAUSES.\nPEOPLE ARE VERY FRUSTRATED BECAUSE POLICE COMMUNITY IS NOT\nWHAT IT SHOULD BE IN MOST PARTS OF THIS COUNTRY.\nTHIS IS REALLY THE WORK OF OUR TIME COMBINE POLICE AND\nCOMMUNITY TOGETHER. THAT HAPPENS THROUGH\nNEIGHBORHOOD POLICING THROUGH CONNECTING PEOPLE VERY\nPERSONALLY, SO POLICING COMMUNITY GET TO KNOW EACH\nOTHER. IT CERTAINLY IS NOT THROUGH\nPOLICIES LIKE STOP AND FRISK WHICH CREATED A REAL WEDGE\nBETWEEN COMMUNITY AND CREATED THE VISION.\nIT'S NOT REALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT, IT'S NOT SOMETHING NEW TO\nUNDERSTAND THAT WE NEED A KIND OF COMMUNICATION TO KIND OF\nUNDERSTAND POLICE AND COMMUNITY. OUR POLICE COMMISSIONER AND THE\nNEIGHBORHOOD POLICING AND BILL BRATTON JUST LEFT OFFICE HERE,\nTHE GREATEST POLICE LEADER OF OUR TIME BELIEVED THAT THE WAY\nFORWARD FOR ALL AMERICAN POLICE DEPARTMENTS WAS TO DEEPEN THAT\nRELATIONSHIP. THIS IS WHERE WE HAVE TO GO.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT STOP AND FRISK BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE\nSAID IT WAS EFFECTIVE. YOU MAY NOT HAVE LIKED IT, BUT\nIT WAS EFFECTIVE. THE CRIME RATE PLUMMETED FROM\nWHAT IT WAS IN NEW YORK CITY IN THE '80s AND EARLY '90s TO THEN\nIN 2011, IT DROPPED BY MORE THAN 75%.\nIT WAS PROACTIVE INSTEAD OF REACTIVE.\n>> I UNDERSTAND PEOPLE SAY THAT. THAT IS JUST NOT THE HISTORY.\nBILL BRATTON CAME IN IN 1994 AND INSTITUTED A SYSTEMATIC\nSTRATEGIC APPROACH TO POLICING THAT'S WHAT REALLY STARTED THE\nCHANGE EVEN BEFORE DAVID DECREASED THE POLICE FORCE HERE.\nSTOP AND FRISK WAS INTENSIFIED FOR A LIMITED PERIOD OF OTIME IN\nTHE LAST DECADE, IN PARTICULAR. AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS IT\nCREATED A HUGE AMOUNT OF DIVISION BETWEEN POLICE AND\nCOMMUNITY. WE ENDED THAT UNCONSTITUTIONAL\nUSE OF STOP AND FRISK. THAT OVERUSE OF STOP AND FRISK.\nWHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE THREE YEARS SINCE WE MADE THE CHANGE?\nCRIME HAS GONE DOWN CONSISTENLY SINCE WE ACTUALLY STOPPED USING\nIT. BILL BRATTON WOULD SAY THAT WHAT\nWE NEED TO DO IS BRING POLICE AND COMMUNITY CLOSER TOGETHER.\nTHAT'S WHAT PROVED TO BE THE CASE.\nSO, YOU KNOW, DONALD TRUMP TALKS ABOUT STOP AND FRISK LIKE HE\nKNOWS THE FACTS. HE HAS HAD NO EXPERIENCING WITH\nPUBLIC SAFETY AND HE SHOULD REALLY BE CAREFUL.\nIF WE REINSTUTED STOP AND FRISK AROUND THIS COUNTRY.\nYOU'LL SEE MORE TENG BETWEEN POLICE AND COMMUNE.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE TERROR ATTACK WE SAW HERE IN NEW YORK\nAND NEW JERSEY OVER THE WEEKEND. RAHAMI WAS THE SUSPECT AND HE\nWAS TAKEN IN ALIVE AFTER A GUNFIGHT WITH POLICE.\nDO YOU KNOW WHAT HIS STATUS IS? IF HE'S TALKING YET TO POLICE?\n>> POLICE, FBI, EVERYONE WANTS TO GET MORE INFORMATION FROM\nHIM, BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO SAY HERE IS NYPD, FBI,\nALL OUR PARTNERS DID AN EXTRAORDINARY JOB OF FINDING HIM\nVERY, VERY QUICKLY. AND WE'VE GOT MORE WORK TO DO.\nA COUPLE PEOPLE OF INTEREST OUT THERE THAT WE'D LIKE TO TALK TO.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THOSE GUYS. PUTTING OUT THE PICTURE, FIRST,\nOF RAHAMI WORKED. WE GOT IT OUT ON TV AND WE GOT\nHIM IN SHORT ORDER. TELL ME ABOUT THE TWO GUYS THAT\nYOU'RE ASKING FOR THE YEEMEDIA' HELP.\nWE USED A BROAD MESSAGING SYSTEM.\nWE SENT TO EVERY CELL PHONE AND EVERY DEVICE IN THE NEW YORK\nMETROPOLITAN AREA A MESSAGE THAT THIS GUY WAS ON THE LOOSE.\nTHAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS BECAUSE IT WAS OUT THERE SO\nBROADLY. >> AND HE HAD BEEN WATCHING,\nCNN, BY THE WAY. AND HE RECOGNIZED RAHAMI ACROSS\nTHE STRAET. >> WE THANK CNN.\nWE HAVE TWO INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE.\nWE DON'T KNOW IF THEY HAVE AN INVOLVEMENT OR NOT.\n>> WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THEY HAVE AN INVOLVEMENT?\n>> BY THE VIDEO, OBVIOUSLY A QUESTION IF THEY WERE SOMEHOW\nASSOCIATED. WE WANT TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT\nTHIS. IT IS NOT CONFIRMATION THEY WERE\nINVOLVED BUT MAY KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE DEVICES THAT WERE USED\nAND PEOPLE WERE STOPPING BY, BUT STILL GIVE US SOME CONTEXT TO\nWHAT THEY KNOW. A LOT MORE WORK TO DO.\nHERE IS THE THING, IT ALL ADDS UP THE SAME WAY.\nTHE FAMOUS PHRASE, IF YOU SEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING.\nI HOPE THIS IS THE ULTIMATE ILLUSTRATION TO THE PEOPLE IN\nTHIS COUNTRY THAT EVERYONE CAN SUPPORT LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH\nTHEIR VOICE PICKING UP THAT PHONE AND GOING OVER TO AN\nOFFICER AND SAYING YOU SAW SOMETHING.\nIN THIS CASE, HOW MANY LIVES WERE SAVED BECAUSE ONE GUY\nFOLLOWED THROUGH AND ACTUALLY -- >> IT REALLY WORKED.\nIN THIS CASE, IT REALLY WORKED. SO MANY PEOPLE.\nWE TALKED TO THE WOMAN WHO SAW THE PRESSURE COOKER.\nSHE CALLED 911 AND THEY WERE ABLE TO LIFT THE FINGERPRINTS\nOFF THAT AND FIND DNA ON THERE. IT WORKED ON EVERY SINGLE LEVEL.\nIS YOUR LATEST THINKING THAT THIS GUY ACTED ALONE OR SOME\nSORT OF HEALTH OR EVEN CELL HERE IN NEW YORK OR NEW JERSEY?\n>> HEY, THIS IS ALL PRELIMINARY. LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL DEFINE THE\nST STATE.\nSO, THEY'LL TELL US, BUT WHAT I CAN TELL YOU SO FAR IS WE DON'T\nHAVE SPECIFIC EVIDENCE OF A CELL.\nWE ARE CONCERNED TO KNOW THAT THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE.\nWE JUST DON'T HAVE A FINAL ANSWER ON THAT YET.\nTHIS HAS TO BE DONE VERY METICULOUSLY AND VERY CAREFULLY.\nDON'T JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS UNTIL WE HAVE THE FACTS.\nI GET THOSE TWO GUYS IN. HUGE INVESTIGATIONS GOING ON AND\nA SEAMLESS INVESTIGATION. THE FBI, NYPD, ALL OUR OTHER\nPARTNERS VERY MUCH WORKING TOGETHER TO FIND OUT WHAT WE\nNEED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS CASE. >> DOES IT WORRY YOU THAT THIS\nWASN'T STOPPED BEFOREHAND? >> SOMETHING TO LEARN ABOUT EACH\nAND EVERY SITUATION. WHAT THAT EARLIER CONTACT WITH\nTHE FBI WAS. BUT IT'S NOT RIGHT, AGAIN, TO\nJUMP TO CONCLUSIONS. A HUGE VOLUME THAT THE FBI HAS\nTO HANDLE. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND\nSPECIFICALLY WHAT DID THEY KNOW? HOW DID THEY FOLLOW UP AND WHAT\nCAN WE LEARN FOR THE FUTURE? THIS IS A PART OF OUR LIVES\nTODAY. BUT THE REASON I MAINTAIN A LOT\nOF HOPE IS EXTRAORDINARY INTELLIGENCE GATHERING CAPACITY\nAND NYPD HAS IT, AS WELL. CONSISTENTLY, WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO\nFIND THINGS AND STOP THEM WITH VERY FEW EXCEPTIONS.\nBUT EVEN WITH THE EXCEPTIONS WHAT WE LEARN AFTER THE FACT IS\nTHAT PEOPLE KNEW. PEOPLE KNEW IF THEY HAD SIMPLY\nCALLED IN, IT COULD HAVE MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE.\nI THINK THIS IS ABOUT DEEPENING THE PUBLIC'S UNDERSTANDING THAT\nTHEY HAVE TO BE A PART OF THIS. THEY HAVE TO BE PARTNERS WITH\nLAW ENFORCEMENT. >> HIS FATHER TRIED.\nHIS FATHER TRIED TO ALERT AUTHORITIES.\n>> THAT'S IMPORTANT. WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED\nTHERE AND I'M NOT FOR A MOMENT SAYING THERE AREN'T SOME THINGS\nTO LEARN FROM THIS AND SOME THINGS MAY NOT HAVE BEEN DONE\nRIGHT. I WILL SAY THIS, WE ARE LEARNING\nEVERY DAY IN THIS AGE WHERE THERE ARE LONE WOLF.\nWE UNDERSTAND THAT. SOMETIMES WE GET THE KIND OF\nPRIOR INFORMATION WE WANT AND INTELLIGENCE GATHERING IS THE\nNUMBER ONE DEFENSIVE FOOL. BUT WE ALSO LEARN IN NEW YORK\nCITY, YOU NEED A BIG, ROBUST FORCE.\nTHE BIGGEST ANTI-TERRORISM FORCE WE INSTITUTED IN THE LAST YEAR.\nA LOT OF INVOLVEMENT FROM THE PUBLIC.\nTHAT WILL GIVE YOU THE BEST CHANCE OF STOPPING THESE THINGS\nBEFORE THEY START. >> GREAT TO HAVE YOU ON \"NEW\nDAY.\" >> THANK YOU.\n>> LET'S GET OVER TO CHRIS.",

IS TELLING US THAT, WELL, THE\nMIDDLE MAN MAKES MORE THAN WE DO.\n>> NOW, BRESCH ACTUALLY RESPONDING TO THAT WITH SEVERAL\nLARGE POSTER BOARD CHARTS, TRYING TO EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE\nBETWEEN THE GENERIC PRODUCT, THE BRANDED PRODUCT, WHAT THEY HAVE\nDONE WITH THE PRICE TO TRY TO HELP PATIENTS AFFORD THE DRUG.\nAND IN A HEATED EXCHANGE WITH REPRESENTATIVE DE CHALET, SHE\nTRIED TO EXPLAIN SHE THOUGHT THE $600 PRICE FOR A TWO-PACK WAS\nFAIR. LISTEN TO THIS.\nWE'RE SUPPOSED TO FEEL GOOD, BECAUSE YOU'VE TAKEN A DRUG\nYOU'RE OVERCHARGING SIX TIMES WHAT IT'S WORTH AND YOU'RE GOING\nTO DROP THE PRICE TO $300. >> SIR, WE WERE RECEIVING 274\nOUT OF THE 6 -- >> DO YOU THINK YOU WERE\nCHARGING TOO MUCH AT 600? >> SIR, THE -- WE BELIEVE IT WAS\nA FAIR PRICE, AND WE HAVE JUST NOW LOWERED THAT PRICE BY HALF.\n>> WHY DID YOU LOWER IT BY HALF IF YOU THOUGHT IT WAS FAIR?\nIF YOU THOUGHT IT WAS FAIR, LEAVE IT WHERE IT'S AT.\n>> NOW, OF COURSE, BRESCH WASN'T THE ONLY ONE TESTIFYING TODAY.\nALSO THE FDA RECEIVING A LOT OF HEATED QUESTIONS.\nABOUT WHY THERE ISN'T MORE COMPETITION FOR THE EPIPEN.\nTHIS IS GOING TO CONTINUE FOR AT LEAST PROBABLY ANOTHER HOUR OR\nTWO, COMES BACK AT 6:30. SO GOING ON QUITE INTO THE OKAY,\nMELISSA. CERTAINLY NOT LETTING UP AT ALL\nON THE MYLAN CEO. >> ALL RIGHT, MEG, THANK YOU.\nMEG TERRELL IN WASHINGTON FOR US.\nI GO TO PETE STRAIGHTAWAY. YOU ACTUALLY BOUGHT MYLAN.\n>> TODAY, YES. FROM?\n>> WHAT I SAW -- >> AWFUL.\n>> AWFUL. >> THE BLOOD IS IN THE STREET.\nIT SEEMS LIKE THEY HAVE ABSOLUTELY COME AFTER THEM LIKE\nTHE PITCHFORKS ARE OUT, RIGHT? WELL, THIS IS -- ABOUT AS BAD AS\nTHINGS CAN GET. MAYBE THEY GO A LITTLE BIT\nWORSE. WHEN I LOOK AT THE OPTION\nVOLATILITY IN THERE AND I SEE IT VERY, VERY LOW, AS A MATTER OF\nFACT, UNDERNEATH WHAT'S NORMAL, AND THIS IS A STOCK TRADING 50\nAND NOW DROPPED BY SEVERAL DOLLARS, I THINK IT'S AN\nOPPORTUNITY. THAT'S WHY I WAS IN THERE TODAY.\n>> PLUS, THE PRICE IN THE STOCK RIGHT NOW, JUST TECHNICAL.\nFORGET EVERYTHING GOING ON. I AGREE WITH PETE THAT USUALLY\nTHAT'S THE PINNACLE OF THE CELL PRESSURE.\nYOU SEE WHEN THEY'RE UP ON CAPITOL HILL.\nBUT 39-ISH GOES BACK A COUPLE YEARS.\n>> WOULD YOU RATHER IN TERMS OF BELEAGUERED STOCKS BECAUSE OF\nWASHINGTON, D.C., WELLS FARGO OR MYLAN?\n>> MYLAN. >> MYLAN.\n>> YEAH, I MEAN, IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT -- AND, AGAIN, THE\nSTREET HAS ALREADY COME OUT AND PUT A -- ROUGHLY 50% COMES FROM\nTHE PERSONALTY PRODUCTS. THEY HAVE SHOWN A SALES LOSS AND\nYOU END UP AT WHATEVER -- 55, $65 TARGET.\nTHE POINT IS, UNLIKE THE REGULATORY BULLS-EYE, I THINK\nYOU HAVE A CASE WHERE THESE FINANCIALS -- THIS IS\nSOMETHING -- THESE GUYS CAN PLAY THROUGH THIS.\n>> UP NEXT, THE MAN KNOWN AS THE BOND KING, DOUBLE END CAPITAL\nJEFFREY GUNDLACH, A FED CRITIC WHO OVERSEES $100 BILLION,\nCALLED IT RIGHT. SO THE FED WOULD NOT HIKE TODAY.\nDOES HE THINK THEY WILL PULL THE TRIGGER IN DECEMBER AND WHAT'S\nHE TELLING HIS CLIENTS RIGHT NOW?\nHE'LL JOIN US EXCLUSIVELY RIGHT AFTER THIS BREAK.",

THE OTHER ISSUE IS THERE'S\nPRESSURE ON THE FDA. THEY NEED TO START LOOKING AT\nSOME OF THESE AREAS WHERE YOU HAVE THESE DRUGS THAT HAVE NO\nCOMPETITION. IS THAT A MESSAGE YOU THINK IS\nGETTING THROUGH ON THE HILL TOO? >> I THINK THE MAIN FOCUS WAS ON\nHEATHER BRESCH.

BUT WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHY\nTHE TEVA GENERIC WAS TURNED DOWN.\nWE HAVEN'T SEEN EXACTLY WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THEIR APPLICATION.\nWHY IT WASN'T IDENTICAL. BUT THIS MORNING RONNY GAL PUT\nOUT A WORD SAYING THE SANOFI PRODUCT, THERE WAS A LOT OF TALK\nABOUT WHETHER IT COULD COME BACK ON.\nTHEY DISCONTINUED THAT PRODUCT BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY DEAD.\nANOTHER SMALL COMPANY HAS REACQUIRED THE LICENSE TO THAT\nPRODUCT AND THERE'S QUESTIONS OVER WHETHER THAT WILL COME\nBACK.

THE PUBLIC IS NOT VERY HAPPY\nABOUT THESE KINDS OF STORIES. AND I THINK IT FEEDS INTO THE\nPERCEPTION THAT BUSINESS IS OUT FOR GREED.\nWITH THE WELLS FARGO CASE, IT'S VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE THIS HAS\nBEEN GOING ON FOR FIVE YEARS. HE WAS ASKED A LOT OF QUESTIONS.\nAND WHAT COMES ACROSS WITH JOHN STUMPF IS THAT HE WAS TALKING\nLIKE A POLITICIAN OR HE'D BEEN COACHED BY ATTORNEYS OR PR\nPEOPLE. >> MARY, HOW DO YOU COMPARE THE\nTWO? HOW DO YOU COMPARE THE HEATHER\nBRESCH PERFORMANCE TO THE DEGREE THESE ARE PERFORMANCES --\n>> WELL -- I THINK THAT JOHN STUMPF DIDN'T COME ACROSS AS\nVERY SINCERE. HE LOOKED NON-EMOTIONAL.\nI THINK THAT HEATHER BRESCH ON THE OTHER HAND TRIED TO TAKE A\nDIFFERENT TACT. SHE AT LEAST TRIED TO TIE IT\nMORE TO DATA, FIGURES, NUMBERS. AND I THINK SHE WAS TRYING TO\nLINK IT TO A HIGHER PURPOSE. WHETHER SHE WAS SUCCESSFUL AT\nTHAT, I DON'T THINK THAT SHE WAS.\n>> AND IF YOU WERE JOHN STUMPF, WHAT COULD HAVE, SHOULD HAVE YOU\nSAID AND NOW THE DAMAGE IS DONE IF YOU THINK IT'S DONE.\nIS THERE ANYTHING HE COULD SAY NOW?\n>> WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR IS FIRST THEY WANT TRANSPARENCY.\nBUT IN ADDITION TO TRANSPARENCY, THEY WANT TO HEAR A SENSE OF\nREMORSE. AND THEY WANT TO KNOW THAT THESE\nEXECUTIVES UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE DEALING WITH.\nTHIS RAISES AGAIN THE ISSUE OF EXECUTIVE PAY AND THE EXTREME\nDISPARITY BETWEEN PEOPLE, THE WORKING PEOPLE AND THE\nEXECUTIVES WHO WERE PAID EXORBITANT AMOUNTS OF MONEY.\nSO WHEN THOSE QUESTIONS GET ASKED ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY\nTHEY'RE PAID, THEY DON'T ANSWER THAT.\nTHEY TRY TO SIDE TRACK TO ANOTHER ISSUE.\nSO YOU HEARD JOHN STUMPF TALK ABOUT THE BOARD AND THE BOARD\nWOULD MAKE A DECISION. AND YOU HEAR THE MASSIVE NUMBERS\nCOMING IN IN TERMS OF PAY. AND YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS COMING\nOFF THE BACKS OF WORKERS OR OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO TAKE\nCARE OF THEIR KIDS. >> MARY, I WAS PRETTY SHOCKED BY\nTHE PERFORMANCE OF JOHN STUMPF IN CONGRESS.\nAND I'M CURIOUS, IF HE'D GONE INTO THAT HEARING AND SAID I'M\nGOING TO GIVE UP MY BONUS, I'M DEEPLY SORRY.\nI KNOW WE'VE MESSED UP AND I KNOW I HAVE TO TAKE A PERSONAL\nFINANCIAL HIT, DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD HAVE HELPED AT ALL?\n>> I THINK -- IT'S ALWAYS TRICKY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT AN APOLOGY\nOR A PERSON TAKING RESPONSIBILITY.\nI THINK WHAT WAS SO DIFFICULT FOR JOHN STUMPF WAS HE SAID I\nTAKE RESPONSIBILITY YET HE SHOWED NO SIGN OF THAT AT ALL.\nI DO THINK THAT WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR MORE THAN AN APOLOGY IS\nA SENSE OF UNDERSTANDING. THAT EXECUTIVES REALIZE THAT\nTHERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING.\nAND FOR THEM THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S BEEN -- THAT'S GOING\nACROSS THE TABLE HERE IS JUST EXORBITANT.\n>> LET ME ASK YOU THIS. IF YOU THINK ABOUT -- AND I\nDON'T MEAN TO DESCRIBE THESE THINGS AS WITCH HUNTS BECAUSE\nBAD THINGS HAVE TAKEN PLACE. BUT TO THE EXTENT THESE THINGS\nARE THEATER AND IF YOU ARE A SENATOR OR CONGRESS PERSON, YOU\nWANT TO GET YOUR SOUND BITE. AND SO THERE IS A QUESTION, I\nIMAGINE, GOING INTO A HEARING LIKE THIS.\nDO YOU SAY I'M NOT ONLY GOING TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY, I'M TAKING\nBACK THE MONEY, I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE A SALARY.\nDO YOU STILL GET THE SAME SOUND BITE?\nMEANING, DOES IT TAKE THE STING OUT OF IT OR NOT?\n>> OF COURSE THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT.\nAND IT IS THEATER AND WE SEE THE CONGRESSMEN WHO ARE TRYING TO\nMAKE THIS POLITICAL THEATER. BUT I THINK IT COMES DOWN TO\nREALLY AN ISSUE, WE TALK ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE\nEXECUTIVES BUT THERE'S A HIGHER LEVEL QUESTION HERE.\nAND THAT IS REALLY ABOUT THE PURPOSE OF BUSINESS.\nAND WHAT THE PURPOSE OF BUSINESS IS.\nWHAT COMES ACROSS TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IS THAT THE\nPURPOSE OF BUSINESS IS TO MAKE MORE AND MORE MONEY.\nI THINK AS A BUSINESS SCHOOL PROFESSOR, I SEE THIS QUITE\nOFTEN. IT'S FRUSTRATING FOR ME BECAUSE\nI SEE THE BENEFITS THAT IT OFFERS.\nBUT WHEN WE SEE CASES LIKE THIS AND THEY'RE SO EXTREME AND SO\nEXCESSIVE, IT MAKES OTHERS GO AFTER BUSINESS.\nAND SO IT MAKES IT MUCH HARDER FOR BUSINESSES TRYING TO DO\nGOOD. >> MARY, WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME\nTHIS MORNING. THANKS.\n>> THANK YOU.",

WHAT HAPPENED?\nBUT MAYBE PEOPLE LIKE THAT, PEOPLE THAT CHOKE, PEOPLE THAT\nDO THAT, MAYBE THEY CAN'T BE DOING WHAT THEY'RE DOING, OKAY?\nTHEY CAN'T BE DOING WHAT THEY'RE DOING.\nSO WE ALL RESPECT OUR POLICE GREATLY.\nAND THEY WILL JUST HAVE TO GET BETTER AND BETTER AND BETTER.\n>> WELL, DONALD TRUMP WAS SPEAKING AT A PREDOMINANTLY\nBLACK CHURCH TO A GROUP OF PASTORS.\nANYWAY, TRUMP DEFENDING SAYING AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS, WHAT DO\nYOU HAVE TO LOSE BY VOTING FOR HIM?\nLET'S WATCH THAT PART. >> I TALKED ABOUT THE CRIME, I\nTALKED ABOUT THE LACK OF EDUCATION, THE BAD SCHOOLS, AND\nI TALKED ABOUT JOBS. THE JOBS ARE -- AND I SAID IT\nTHREE, FOUR, FIVE TIMES AND THEN ONE DAY I SAID, WHAT DO YOU HAVE\nTO LOSE? I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO\nLOSE? AND SOMEHOW THAT RESONATED.\nSOME PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE IT. BUT I SAID, WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES\nIT MAKE? I MEAN, IT'S TRUE.\nWHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? >> TRUMP WAS SBRUSED BY DON\nKING, YOU SAW IN THE PICTURE, HE CALLED TRUMP THE ONLY GLADIATOR\nTO TAKE ON THE SYSTEM. AND HE GOT THE ATTENTION FROM\nTHE LANGUAGE HE USED. YOU WATCH, YOU DECIDE.\n>> NOW, AMERICA NEEDS DONALD TRUMP.\nWE NEED DONALD TRUMP. ET CETERA SPECIALLY BLACK\nPEOPLE. I TOLD MICHAEL JACKSON, YOU'RE A\nPOOR NEGRO. I WOULD USE THE N-WORD, BUT IF\nYOU ARE A RICH NEGRO, IF YOU ARE DANCING AND SLIDING --\n[ BLEEP ], YOU ARE A DANCING AND SLIDING NEGRO.\nSO DO NOT ALIENATE BECAUSE YOU CANNOT ASSIMILATE.\nSO YOU ARE GOING TO BE A NEGRO UNTIL YOU DIE.\n>> JOINING ME IS PASTOR DARYL. GIVE US WHAT YOU THOUGHT OF\nDONALD TRUMP'S PERFORMANCE TODAY.\nIF YOU KEEP VOTING FOR ME -- GIVE ME WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE\nN-WORD, WHAT DO YOU THINK? >> WE HAD A TREMENDOUS TIME\nTODAY. WE HAD AN OUTSTANDING TIME.\nMR. TRUMP WAS VERY COMFORTABLE AND HE WAS ABLE TO OPEN HIS\nHEART AND SHARE WHAT THE PASTORS THAT WERE THERE, WE ASKED THEM\nSOME QUESTIONS ABOUT SUPREME COURT AND THE SCHOOL CHOICE AND\nRELIGIOUS LIBERTIES AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.\nAND WE HAD A GREAT TIME. WE HAD A VERY GREAT TIME.\nDON KING HAS BEEN A FRIEND OF HIS FOR OVER 30 YEARS.\nAND IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, DON KING FLEW IN WITH HIM FROM NEW\nYORK. AND AS A SPECIAL FRIEND OF MR.\nTRUMP'S, WE ALLOWED HIM TO INTRODUCE HIM.\nWE ALL KNOW THAT DON KING IS FLAMBOYANT, HE'S COLORFUL, HE'S\nOUTSPOKEN, HE'S BOY STROUS AND IS SHARING PERSONAL INSIGHT FROM\nHIS CONVERSATION WITH MICHAEL JACKSON.\nI DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS AN ACCIDENT OR ACCIDENTALLY ON PURPOSE, BUT A CERTAIN ADJECTIVE\nSLIPPED OUT. I WASN'T OFFENDED AND THE CROWD\nWASN'T OFFENDED. IT IS JUST SOMETHING THAT THE\nMEDIA WANTS TO HARP UPON. >> I'M ASKING YOU ABOUT IT.\nLET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THE MOOD IN YOUR COMMUNITY AND YOUR\nCONGREGATION, WHERE DOES IT STAND IN EVERYBODY IS TALKING\nABOUT IT, TRUMP VERSUS CLINTON. WHAT ARE YOU HEARING OUT THERE\nIN THE PEWS? >> SUNDAY FOR ME IS CHURCH TIME\nAND GOD'S TIME. I DON'T USE THE WORD GOD HAS\nGIVEN ME TO SPEAK FOR HIS POLITICS, AND I DON'T TRY TO\nINFLUENCE THEM IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.\nMY CONGREGATION KNOWS I SUPPORT TRUMP BUT DO NOT TRY TO\nINFLUENCE THEIR POLITICS. I JUST TRY TO MAKE AN EDUCATED\nDECISION AND DON'T LET PEOPLE THINK FOR YOU.\nHOWEVER N THE BLACK COMMUNITY TRUMP'S MESSAGE IS BEGINNING TO\nRESONATE MORE AND MORE AND MORE. I TALKED TO A LOT OF PEOPLE,\nTHERE WAS A YOUNG DELIVERY MAN THAT CAME TO MY HOUSE, HE WAS A\nMILLENIAL IN HIS MID TO LATE 20s, THERE WAS TWO OF THEM, AND\nHE DIDN'T KNOW WHO I WAS OR KNOW I HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH MR.\nTRUMP. AND I ASKED HIM WHO DO YOU LIKE\nFOR THE ELECTION? AND HIS REPLY TO ME WAS, HEY,\nMAN, THERE'S SOMETHING FISHY ABOUT HILLARY.\nI SAID, WHAT DO YOU MEAN? HE SAID, THERE'S SOMETHING FISHY\nABOUT HILLARY, SHE'LL SAY ANYTHING TO GET A VOTE.\nAND I SAID, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT TRUMP?\nHE SAID, I THINK TRUMP KEEPS IT REAL.\nHERE'S THIS GUY IS HIS MID-20s. MILLENIALS ARE SUSPECT AS FAR AS\nHILLARY IS CONCERNED AND WOULD RATHER HAVE SOMEONE SPEAK TO\nTHEM THAT THEY CAN PERCEIVE AS SPEAKING REALISTICALLY.\nSO I THINK THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF UNDERCOVER, I CALL THEM THE\nINCOGNEGROS THAT SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP BUT DON'T SUPPORT HIM\nOPENLY BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO EXPERIENCE THE BACKLASH FROM\nOUR COMMUNITY. >> I UNDERSTAND.\nLET ME ASK YOU ABOUT DONALD TRUMP -- PASTOR, ONE OF THE\nTRUMP COMMENTS TODAY WAS THAT THE BLACK COMMUNITY OF\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE WORSE OFF THAN THEY HAVE EVER BEEN.\nIS THAT A FAIR ASSESSMENT OF HOW THINGS STAND IN 2016?\n>> HE WAS SAYING SOME SEGMENTS OF THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nCOMMUNITY ARE. I MEAN, ALL AFRICAN-AMERICANS\nAREN'T DOING BAD, EVERYONE ISN'T DO BAD OR LIVING IN A DEPRESSED\nCOMMUNITY, BUT THERE IS A SEGMENT OF OUR COMMUNITY AND\nIT'S THAT SEGMENT THAT HE WAS MAKING THAT STATEMENT.\nTO BE HONEST, WHEN YOU HEAR A NUMBER OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS\nTALK, WE ALL TALK ABOUT HOW BAD THINGS ARE FOR US RIGHT NOW.\nI MEAN, OUR GRADUATION RATE IS LOWER THAN IT HAS BEEN SINCE\n1963. IT'S HARDER FOR US TO FIND\nEMPLOYMENT. WE'RE HAVING RIOTS IN THE\nSTREET. WE'RE GETTING BEAT UP OR KILLED\nBY THE POLICE. THESE CONDITIONS HAVEN'T EXISTED\nSINCE THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT OF THE '60s.\nSO FOR A LOT OF US, THINGS ARE REALLY BAD.\nSO IF THIS IS HAPPENING UNDER AN EIGHT-YEAR DEMOCRATIC\nADMINISTRATION AND WE'RE SAYING THAT HILLARY CLINTON WILL BE\nSIMPLY AN EXTENSION OF THESE PRIOR EIGHT YEARS, WE'RE LOOKING\nAT FOUR MORE YEARS OF THE SAME. SO WHAT DO WE HAVE TO LOSE?\nWE'RE GAMBLING WITH HOUSE MONEY. GIVE HIM A SHOT, GIVE HIM A\nCHANCE, SEE IF HE CAN IMPROVE IT.\nIF HE CAN'T IMPROVE IN FOUR YEARS, VOTE HIM OUT.\n>> YOU SAID WE'RE GETTING KILLED BY POLICE.\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL THESE CASES, THEY ARE ALL A LITTLE\nDIFFERENT, BUT THERE IS A PATTERN.\nWHAT IS IT, ARE THEY TRIGGER HAPPY?\nSOME OF THE POLICE ARE AFRICA AN AMERICAN POLICE THEMSELVES, DOWN\nIN CHARLOTTE, BUT WHAT IS IT, IS IT MORE TRIGGER HAPPY, ARE THEY\nSCARED? IS THIS SOMETHING THAT WENT ON\nBEFORE WE HAD VIDEOTAPES BEFORE PEOPLE HAD CELL PHONES AND TOOK\nPICTURES? HAS IT ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THIS?\nIT'S IN THE NEWS ALL THE TIME. WHAT IS GOING ON?\n>> SOME ARE TRIGGER HAPPY, SOME ARE SCARED.\nBUT THEY ARE ONLY TRIGGER HAPPY WHEN IT COMES TO BLACKS.\nSOME ARE AFRAID OF BLACKS. YOU'RE RIGHT, WE'RE SEEING IT\nMORE AND MORE BECAUSE OF THE ADVENT OF VIDEO CAMERAS.\nLISTEN, I WAS RAISE IN THE '60s. MY VERY FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH\nPOLICE WHEN I WAS NOT A TEENAGER YET WAS I GOT BEAT UP BY COPS.\nBUT WHAT IS FUNNY IN THAT TIME IN THE EARLY '70s WE GOT BEAT UP\nBY POLICE, IT WAS NOT UNUSUAL BECAUSE I HAD A LOT OF FRIENDS\nBEAT UP BY WHITE POLICE, TOO. I HAD FRIENDS IN THE '70s KILLED\nBY THE POLICE. I HAVE TWO FRIENDS THAT I WENT\nTO HIGH SCHOOL WITH, VERY LOUD-MOUTH GUYS, CRIMINALS, BUT\nTHEY WERE ARRESTED AND HUNG THEMSELVES IN JAIL.\nBUT WE KNEW THEY HAD BEEN HANGING THEMSELVES.\nTHAT WAS A NORM IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY EVEN WHILE I WAS\nGROWING UP. IT IS THE VERY REAL THRILL OF\nGETTING BEAT UP OR KILLED BY POLICE, IT WAS A REALITY THEN\nAND IS A REALITY NOW. IT'S SIMPLY CAUGHT ON VIDEOTAPE\nNOW. IT HAS TO STOP.\nIT DOES, INDEED, HAVE TO STOP. >> YOUR VOICE IS POWERFUL, THANK\nYOU, PASTOR DARRELL SCOTT. LET'S BRING IN RNC CHAIR MICHAEL\nSTEELE. YESTERDAY HILLARY CLINTON TALKED\nABOUT THE NEED TO IMPROVE POLICING IN THE RECENT SHOOTINGS\nOF AFRICAN AMERICANS. LET'S LISTEN IN, SECRETARY\nCLINTON RIGHT NOW.",

WE PLAN TO DO THAT THIS TIME.\nI THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE DO SEE THE EVIDENCE AND\nTHAT WE'RE GOING TO WORK WITH THIS ACTIVE INVESTIGATION TO\nMAKE SURE PEOPLE GET THE ACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT\nREALLY HAPPENED. IT'S A TRAGIC TIME FOR OUR CITY.\nI AM ASKING FOR CALM.

I HAVE TALKED TO MANY LEADERS IN\nOUR COMMUNITY WHO ARE UNDERSTANDABLY UPSET, AND WE ARE\nHOPING THAT THEY WILL WORK WITH US AS WE BRING ALL THESE FACTS\nTO LIGHT. >> MADAM MAYOR, THE POLICE\nCHIEF, I BELIEVE HE COULDN'T SAY FOR SURE IF SCOTT POINTED HIS\nGUN TOWARDS POLICE. DOES THAT MATTER LEGALLY, OR IS\nTHE PRESENCE OF A GUN ENOUGH? >> WELL, WHAT I HAVE HEARD OUR\nCHIEF TALK ABOUT IS THE OFFICER HAS TO PERCEIVE A REAL IMMINENT\nTHREAT. AND THERE ARE PROTOCOLS THEY GO\nTHROUGH. THERE IS EXTENSIVE TRAINING THAT\nTHEY GO THROUGH. AND THIS IS NOT ANYTHING TO BE\nTAKEN LIGHTLY.

WE'VE HAD OUR LOCAL, OUR COUNTY,\nOUR STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENGAGED.\nWE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE GETTING GOOD INFORMATION TO\nPEOPLE.

LET ME EXPRESS ALL OF OUR BEST\nWISHES FOR WHAT HAPPENS IN CHARLOTTE IN THE COMING DAYS.\nHAVE YOU SEEN ANY PARTS OF THIS VIDEO THAT SHOWS THE SHOOTING OF\nKEITH LAMONT SCOTT? >> I HAVE NOT SEEN THE VIDEO\nMYSELF, AND I KNOW THAT IN THE PAST WE'VE HAD INCIDENTS LIKE\nTHIS AND THE CHIEF IS VERY OPEN TO SHOWING THAT VIDEO TO -- NOT\nJUST TO ELECTED OFFICIALS BUT ALSO TO COMMUNITY LEADERS.\nWE HAVE DONE THAT IN THE PAST. WE PLAN TO DO THAT THIS TIME.\nI THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE DO SEE THE EVIDENCE AND\nTHAT WE'RE GOING TO WORK WITH THIS ACTIVE INVESTIGATION TO\nMAKE SURE PEOPLE GET THE ACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT\nREALLY HAPPENED. IT'S A TRAGIC TIME FOR OUR CITY.\nI AM ASKING FOR CALM. I AM ASKING FOR THE COMMUNITY TO\nHAVE PEACEFUL PROTESTS AND TO LET OUR OFFICERS AND OUR\nCOMMUNITY DO ITS WORK OF FINDING OUT THE REAL TRUTH AND MAKING\nSURE WE DO HAVE EVIDENCE THAT EXPLAINS THAT AND SHOWS THAT.\n>> I THINK EVERYBODY WOULD AGREE THAT, IF THE EVIDENCE AND THE\nVIDEO SHOWS THAT THE OFFICER'S VERSION OF EVENTS IS THE CORRECT\nONE, THAT THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT THING TO COME TO THE\nPUBLIC. HAVE YOU SPOKEN WITH ANYBODY WHO\nHAS SEEN THE VIDEO? >> I HAVE SPOKEN TO THE CHIEF.\nAND AGAIN, THERE ARE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES AND DIFFERENT\nVIDEOS. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT\nBODY CAMERAS. THERE WERE SOME DASH CAMERAS.\nTHERE MAY BE SOME COMMUNITY VIDEOS.\nAND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE, WHEN YOU SEE ALL THE\nPERSPECTIVES, THAT WE HAVE A COMPLETE PICTURE OF WHAT\nHAPPENED. AND AGAIN, WE HAVE A TRADITION\nOF BEING TRANSPARENT. WE HAVE A TRADITION OF BEING\nTHOROUGH IN OUR INVESTIGATIONS. WE ABSOLUTELY TEND TO WORK WITH\nTHE COMMUNITY. I HAVE TALKED TO MANY LEADERS IN\nOUR COMMUNITY WHO ARE UNDERSTANDABLY UPSET, AND WE ARE\nHOPING THAT THEY WILL WORK WITH US AS WE BRING ALL THESE FACTS\nTO LIGHT. >> MADAM MAYOR, THE POLICE\nCHIEF, I BELIEVE HE COULDN'T SAY FOR SURE IF SCOTT POINTED HIS\nGUN TOWARDS POLICE. DOES THAT MATTER LEGALLY, OR IS\nTHE PRESENCE OF A GUN ENOUGH? >> WELL, WHAT I HAVE HEARD OUR\nCHIEF TALK ABOUT IS THE OFFICER HAS TO PERCEIVE A REAL IMMINENT\nTHREAT. AND THERE ARE PROTOCOLS THEY GO\nTHROUGH. THERE IS EXTENSIVE TRAINING THAT\nTHEY GO THROUGH. AND THIS IS NOT ANYTHING TO BE\nTAKEN LIGHTLY. WE ARE WORKING VERY HARD ON OUR\nCOMMUNITY POLICING RELATIONSHIPS WHERE OUR OFFICERS ARE IN OUR\nCOMMUNITIES, PLAYING BASKETBALL WITH OUR KIDS, WHERE THEY KNOW\nOUR COMMUNITIES, WHERE THE COMMUNITIES KNOW THEM.\nWE HAVE WORKED MANY YEARS TO BUILD THAT RELATIONSHIP HERE IN\nCHARLOTTE. >> HOW QUICKLY WOULD YOU LIKE TO\nSEE THE VIDEO RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC, SHOWN TO THE FAMILY AND\nCOMMUNITY LEADERS? >> OBVIOUSLY AS QUICKLY AS\nPOSSIBLE. I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THAT\nVERY SOON. WE'VE HAD A LOT OF COMMUNICATION\nGOING ON TODAY. WE'VE HAD OUR LOCAL, OUR COUNTY,\nOUR STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENGAGED.\nWE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE GETTING GOOD INFORMATION TO\nPEOPLE. AND WE DO WANT PEOPLE TO NOT\nJUMP TO CONCLUSIONS BASED ON PARTIAL INFORMATION OR INCORRECT\nINFORMATION. WE HAD SOME INCORRECT\nINFORMATION OUT EARLIER ABOUT THE RACE OF THE OFFICER.\nAGAIN, THIS INFORMATION ABOUT A BOOK.\nI MEAN, THERE ARE SO MANY STORIES.\nWE WANT TO HAVE CLEAR, IRREFUTABLE EVIDENCE.\nWE'RE WORKING VERY HARD TO MAKE THAT ACCESSIBLE.\n>> ALL RIGHT, MAYOR. JENNIFER ROBERTS, THANK YOU SO\nMUCH.",

WHAT [ BLEEP ] HE HAD?\nHE IN THE CAR READING [ BLEEP ] YOU ALL MUST [ BLEEP ] BECAUSE\nHE BLACK. >> CHARLOTTE POLICE HAVE NOT\nRELEASED THE VIDEO, BUT MAINTAINED THE EVIDENCE\nRECOVERED AT THE SCENE PROVES THEIR STORY.\n>> A WEAPON WAS SEIZED. A HANDGUN.\nI CAN ALSO TELL YOU WE DID NOT FIND A BOOK THAT HAS BEEN MADE\nREFERENCE TO. >> Reporter: THESE CONFLICTING\nACCOUNTS OFFERING LITTLE COMFORT TO SCOTT'S WIFE ISSUED A\nSTATEMENT LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS\nASSERTING, QUOTE, AFTER LISTENING TO REMARKS MADE BY\nCHARLOTTE MECKLENBURG POLICE CHIEF TODAY WE HAVE MORE\nQUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS ABOUT KEITH'S DEATH.\nREST ASSURED, WE WILL WORK DILIGENTLY TO GET ANSWERS TO OUR\nQUESTIONS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.\nTHE ACLU HAS CALLED FOR CHARLOTTE POLICE TO RELEASE THE\nOFFICER'S VIDEO DESPITE A NEW LAW THAT THE CITY SAYS PROHIBITS\nTHEM FROM RELEASING IT. BUT THE NOW LAW DOESN'T GO INTO\nEFFECT FOR ANOTHER WEEK. CHARLOTTE'S MAYOR TELLING CNN\nLAST NIGHT, SHE WILL REVIEW THE VIDEO TODAY.\n>> THERE ARE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES AND DIFFERENT\nVIDEOS. THERE ARE A COUPLE DIFFERENT\nBODY CAMERAS AND SOME DASH CAMERAS.\nTHERE MAY BE SOME COMMUNITY VIDEOS.\nWE WANT TO HAVE CLEAR, IRR IRREFUTABLE EVIDENCE.\nWE'RE WORKING VERY HARD TO MAKE THAT ACCESSIBLE.\n>> SO WHEN OR EVEN IF THAT VIDEO WILL ACTUALLY BE RELEASED, THAT\nIS STILL A QUESTION HERE ON THE STREETS OF CHARLOTTE,\nPARTICULARLY AFTER THE MAYOR ACTUALLY GETS TO SEE THAT\nFOOTAGE FIRSTHAND, SPEAK TO PEOPLE OTHER, ALISYN, THERE ARE\nHIGH HOPES THAT WHEN THAT FOOTAGE IS RELEASED IT COULD\nCALM SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS, BUT THEN YOU HEAR PEOPLE ON THE\nOTHER SIDE OF THE SPECTRUM WHO WORRY THAT IF IT DOES, IN FACT,\nSUPPORT THIS CLAIM FROM OFFICERS, THAT IT COULD JUST\nFUEL SOME OF THE FLAMES AND EVEN SOME OF THOSE FRUSTRATIONS AS\nPROTESTERS ARE EXPECTED TO BE ON THE STREETS AGAIN TONIGHT.\n>> OKAY, POLO WE'RE ABOUT TO GET SOME ANSWERS.\nWE'RE ABOUT TO SPEAK TO A MAN WHO HAS SEEN THAT VIDEO THAT HAS\nNOT BEEN RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC. WHAT DOES IT SHOW?\nTODD WALKER IS A SPOKESPERSON FOR THE CHARLOTTE FRATERNAL\nORDER OF POLICE. HE JOINS US NOW.\nTHANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. >> GOOD MORNING, ALISYN.\n>> WE JUST HEARD FROM THE MAYOR THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT\nVIDEOS. THERE ARE SOME DASH CAM VIDEOS,\nTHERE WERE SOME BODY CAMERA VIDEOS.\nMIGHT HAVE BEEN SOME SURVEILLANCE VIDEOS FROM AROUND\nTHE PARKING LOT. WHICH ONE DID YOU SEE?\n>> WELL, ALISYN, WHAT I CAN SAY IS I HAVE SEEN ONE OF THE DASH\nCAM VIDEOS. THE SAME ONE THAT OUR CHIEF HAS\nALSO VIEWED. >> AND WHAT DID IT SHOW YOU?\n>> WELL, WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT THIS IS STILL AN ACTIVE\nINVESTIGATION, LIKE THE CHIEF HAS ECHOED.\nTHERE'S SOME INFORMATION THAT JUST CANNOT BE RELEASED BECAUSE\nIT IS STILL AN ACTIVE INVESTIGATION.\nI CAN CONFIRM EXACTLY WHAT CHIEF PUTNY HAS SAID, MR. SCOTT WAS\nARMED WHEN HE EXITED THE VEHICLE.\nA WEAPON WAS RECOVERED. A HANDGUN WAS RECOVERED ON THE\nSCENE NEXT TO MR. SCOTT. AND THAT'S EXACTLY THE SAME\nTHING THAT I SAW WHAT STEVE PUTNY SAW.\n>> MR. WALTHER TAKE US THROUGH IT BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF\nQUESTIONS ABOUT THE DETAILS. WAS MR. SCOTT SITTING IN HIS CAR\nWHEN OFFICERS APPROACHED HIM ON THE VIDEO?\n>> WELL, AGAIN, ALISYN, WITH THE INVESTIGATION GOING ON, I CAN'T\nGO INTO DETAIL FROM MY VIEW WHAT I SAW ON THE VIDEO.\nI DON'T WANT TO HARM THE INVESTIGATION IN ANY WAY.\nBECAUSE WE WANT TO BE JUST AND RIGHT IN THIS INVESTIGATION.\n>> WELL LOOK MR. -- >> I CAN ONLY ECHO AGAIN WHAT'S\nALREADY BEEN SAID IS HE WAS SEATED IN WHEN HE WAS APPROACHED\nBUT WHEN HE EXITED THAT VEHICLE, HE WAS GIVEN CLEAR COMMANDS TO\nDROP THE WEAPON, AND HE DID NOT DO THAT.\n>> AND, AND -- >> SO HE WAS ARMED WHEN HE CAME\nOUT OF THAT VEHICLE AND REFUSED TO LISTEN TO OFFICERS.\n>> CAN YOU TELL US EXACTLY WHAT THE OFFICERS SAID TO HIM WHEN HE\nGOT OUT OF THE VEHICLE? >> WELL, IT'S COMMON PRACTICE\nACROSS THE COUNTRY. YOU IDENTIFY YOURSELF AS A\nPOLICE OFFICER, IF THERE'S ANY TYPE OF WEAPON, THESE OFFICERS\nWERE TELLING MR. SCOTT TO DROP THE WEAPON.\nJUST LIKE THROUGH ANY KIND OF TRAINING ACROSS THE COUNTRY,\nIT'S CLEAR, IT'S LOUD, THERE'S NO MISTAKING OF WHAT HE'S BEING\nTOLD TO DROP THE WEAPON. >> WHAT DID MR. SCOTT SAY TO THE\nOFFICERS? >> THAT I DON'T KNOW.\nTHERE IS NO -- I COULDN'T HEAR ANYTHING OF THAT.\nBUT LIKE I SAID, IT'S STILL PART OF THE INVESTIGATION.\nOUR INVESTIGATION TEAM IS VERY PROFESSIONAL.\nTHEY'RE GOING TO DO A GREAT JOB AND LOOK INTO EVERY DETAIL.\nTHEY'RE INTERVIEWING EVERYBODY OUT THERE.\nAND, YOU KNOW, THIS IS NOT CHARLOTTE.\nTHIS IS OUTSIDE -- THESE ARE CRIMINALS COMING IN DOING THIS\nVIOLENCE. THEY CAN'T BE CALLED PROTESTERS.\nTHESE ARE CRIMINALS THAT ARE DOING THIS VIOLENCE.\n>> MR. WALTHER HERE'S AN IMPORTANT POINT THAT WE'RE\nHOPING YOU CAN ANSWER. WAS THE APPROACHING OFFICER, THE\nFIRST OFFICER WHO APPROACHED MR. SCOTT, WAS HE A PLAINCLOTHED\nPOLICE OFFICER? OR WAS HE IN UNIFORM?\n>> NO, ALL THE OFFICERS OUT THERE, BOTH UNIFORM, WERE\nUNIFORMED AND THEY WERE IDENTIFIED BY A VEST OR JACKET,\nIDENTIFYING THEMSELVES AS OFFICERS.\nPOLICE JUST LIKE THE CHIEF SAID IN HIS PRESS CONFERENCE, THAT\nHAD A BIG LOGO ACROSS THEIR CHEST OF POLICE,\nCHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG POLICE DEPARTMENT.\nTHERE'S NO MISTAKING OF WHO THEY WERE.\n>> OKAY BECAUSE WE HAD HEARD CONFLICTING REPORTS OF THIS.\nIN FACT WE HAD HEARD THAT THE POLICE OFFICER WHO ACTUALLY SHOT\nMR. SCOTT WAS NOT IN UNIFORM, BECAUSE HE WASN'T WEARING A BODY\nCAM. AND THE REASON HE WASN'T WEARING\nA BODY CAM WAS BECAUSE HE WAS NOT IN UNIFORM, HE WAS IN PLAIN\nCLOTHES. SO YOU'RE SAYING NO, NOT AN\nUNDERCOVER OFFICER? >> THEY MAY HAVE BEEN IN PLAIN\nCLOTHES IS WHAT I'M SAYING. SOME OF THE OFFICERS WERE.\nBUT THEY WERE STILL WEARING WHAT WE CALL A FLAK VEST OVER THAT\nSHIRT OR COAT, WHICH IDENTIFIES THEM AS AN OFFICER.\nHAS POLICE WRITTEN RIGHT ACROSS THE CHEST, AND RIGHT ACROSS THE\nBACK OF IT. THERE'S NO MISTAKING THAT THESE\nWERE OFFICERS. >> SO THAT -- AND YOU SAY THAT\nYOU SAW MR. SCOTT ON THE VIDEO WITH A GUN.\nTHAT GUN, POLICE SAY, HAS BEEN RECOVERED.\nCAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT GUN. IS IT -- WAS IT REGISTERED TO\nMR. SCOTT? >> THAT'S INFORMATION I JUST\nDON'T HAVE, ALISYN. I CAN -- AND EVEN IF I DID, IT'S\nPART OF THE INVESTIGATION THAT THE DEPARTMENT CAN'T RELEASE.\n>> MR. WALTHER IT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT THIS\nVIDEO IS SO UNEQUIVOCAL, THAT IF IT WERE RELEASED, TO THE PUBLIC,\nOR TO THE MEDIA, OR CERTAINLY TO MR. SCOTT'S FAMILY, THAT IT\nACTUALLY COULD ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS.\nAND IT COULD, PERHAPS, JUSTIFY WHAT THE POLICE DID.\nSO WHY NOT RELEASE THIS VIDEO SO THAT EVERYBODY CAN SEE IT?\n>> WELL THAT'S -- THAT'S A DECISION THAT'S ABOVE ME.\nTHAT WILL HAVE TO BE DISCUSSED THROUGH THE CITY ATTORNEYS --\n>> BUT DO YOU SUPPORT -- YOU WERE THE FORM PRESIDENT OF THE\nFRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE. DO YOU SUPPORT RELEASING THIS\nVIDEO TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS? >> TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS, IT\nCOULD, YES. WHAT I WOULD SAY, THOUGH, IS\nTHAT YOU'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE THAT ENTITY THAT'S GOING TO PICK\nTHE VIDEO APART, AND PUT IT OUT THERE THAT THIS WAS DONE WRONG\nOR THAT WAS DONE WRONG. THE CLEAR FACTS WILL COME OUT,\nAND THE TRUTH WILL COME OUT. >> AND, AND, MR. WALTHER --\n>> IT'S UNFORTUNATE TO SAY THAT WE HAVE TO BE PATIENT.\nBUT THAT'S THE WAY IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE.\n>> DO YOU SEE SOMETHING DONE WRONG WHEN YOU WATCH THAT VIDEO?\n>> NO. I DO NOT.\n>> MR. WALTHER -- >> I THINK THAT EVERYTHING -- GO\nAHEAD. >> WELL, LOOK, I MEAN I DON'T\nHAVE TO TELL YOU YOU'RE STANDING IN FRONT OF A VANDALIZED\nBUILDING. THIS COULD HELP QUELL THE\nVIOLENCE IF BEAM WERE ABLE TO GET SOME ANSWERS.\nPART OF THE PROBLEM IS THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY.\nCAN YOU PRESS THE POLICE TO RELEASE THE VIDEO?\n>> WE WILL STAND BEHIND AND SUPPORT CHIEF PUTNY AND THE\nCITY'S DECISION. WHETHER OR NOT THEY RELEASE IT\nOR DO NOT RELEASE, THAT'S THE FOP STAND AT THIS POINT.\nI'LL ECHO AND SAY AGAIN THAT THIS DAMAGE AND VIOLENCE IS\nBEING DONE BY CRIMINALS FOR THE MAJORITY THAT ARE COMING\nOUTSIDE. THESE ARE NOT PROTESTERS.\nPROTESTERS HAVE A CAUSE TO -- FOR COMMUNICATION.\nAND TRANSPARENCY. THESE ARE NOT PROTESTERS.\nTHESE ARE CRIMINALS THAT ARE COMING OUT AND DOING THE DAMAGE\nHERE IN CHARLOTTE. MOST OF THEM HAVE -- I MEAN WHY\nARE YOU LOOTING A STORE? THAT'S NOT GETTING YOUR MESSAGE\nACROSS. THAT'S STEALING.\nTHAT'S DOING DAMAGE TO A COMMUNITY HERE.\nTHESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT FROM CHARLOTTE THAT'S DOING\nTHIS. >> YEAH.\nYES. MR. TODD WALTHER FROM THE\nCHARLOTTE FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE.\nTHANK YOU FOR COMING ON AND SHARING WHAT YOU'VE SEEN WITH\nUS. >> THANK YOU, ALISYN.\n>> LET'S GET TO CHRIS. >> THE PROBLEM IS TWO THINGS\nCOULD BE TRUE. YOU CAN HAVE RIOTERS WHO AREN'T\nTHERE FOR LEGITIMATE PROTEST PURPOSE WHO ARE LOOTING, AND,\nAND, YOU CAN HAVE A HUGE BREACH IN TRUST BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF\nTRANSPARENCY WITH THAT COMMUNITY.\nLET'S DISCUSS THAT WITH BALTIMORE MAYOR STEPHANIE\nRAWLINGS-BLAKE LAST YEAR AS YOU'LL REMEMBER HER CITY SAW\nVIOLENT PROTEST AND RIOTS AFTER A BLACK MANFREDEE GRAY DIED IN\nPOLICE CUSTODY. MAYOR, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US\nTHIS MORNING. THE VIDEOTAPE MATTERS.\nYOU JUST HEARD THE SPOKESPERSON FOR THE FRATERNAL ORDER OF\nPOLICE IN CHARLOTTE SAYING YOU PUT IT OUT, IT GETS PICKED APART\nWE WANT THIS TO COME OUT THE RIGHT WAY AT THE RIGHT TIME.\nWHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THE TRANSPARENCY VALUE OF VIDEO AND\nWHEN IT SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE?\n>> I THINK YOUR QUESTION SPEAKS TO A LARGER ISSUE.\nAND THAT'S THE FACT THAT THERE'S JUST NO TRUST.\nTHERE'S A LOT OF ANGER. OUR COUNTRY IS AT A BOILING\nPOINT WHEN IT COMES TO RACE RELATIONS WHEN IT COMES TO\nCOMMUNITY POLICE RELATIONS. AND THERE'S NO TRUST.\nPEOPLE DON'T TRUST THE POLICE. PEOPLE DON'T TRUST POLITICIANS.\nPEOPLE DON'T TRUST THE MEDIA. AND WHEN YOU MIX ALL OF THOSE\nTHINGS TOGETHER, IN A VERY VOLATILE SITUATION, LIKE WE HAVE\nIN BALTIMORE, LIKE WE HAD IN -- LIKE WE HAVE IN CHARLOTTE WE'VE\nSEEN IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY IT'S JUST NO GOOD FOR\nANYONE. WHAT I CAN SAY IS WHAT I'VE\nHEARD REPEATEDLY FROM THE FAMILIES OF THOSE -- OF THE\nVICTIMS IN CUSTODY THAT -- OR YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WHO'VE LOST A\nFAMILY AT THE HANDS OF THE POLICE IS THEY WANT PEACE.\nTHEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO PEACEFULLY DETERMINE THE FACTS.\nAND LET THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM PLAY ITS COURSE.\nAND THAT'S WHAT I WOULD ASK FOR -- THAT'S WHAT I ASK IN\nBALTIMORE. AND THAT'S WHAT I ASK IN\nCHARLOTTE. BECAUSE ONCE THESE THINGS ARE\nDESTROYED YOU'RE STROIG THE BUSINESSES, YOU'RE DESTROYING\nTHE STORES. IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT THAT\nDAMAGE IS DONE AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE AWHILE FOR THE COMMUNITY TO\nREPAIR ITSELF. >> RIGHT.\nBUT YOU GET TO THE HOW. HOW, HOW, HOW DO YOU REPAIR\nTRANSPARENCY SEEING IT FOR YOURSELF.\nTHIS ISN'T LIKE FREDDIE GRAY. YOU HAD CELL PHONE VIDEO THERE\nTHAT BASED ON WHAT YOU SAW RENDERED BY THE JUSTICE SYSTEM\nGAVE A DECEPTIVE NOTION OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND WHAT HIS\nDISTRESS WAS AND WHAT IT WAS CAUSED BY IF YOU LOOK AT THE\nOUTCOMES OF THE TRIALS THAT YOU'VE HAD TO THIS POINT.\nBUT HERE, THIS IS VERY FACT SENSITIVE.\nTHIS IS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT HE HAD A GUN ON A VERY BASIC LEVEL.\nTHE VIDEO WOULD SHOW THAT. DO YOU NOT BELIEVE THAT THE\nVALUE OF THAT DISCLOSURE WOULD REQUIRE THE AUTHORITIES TO PUT\nTHE VIDEO OUT? >> I THINK WE'RE ALL SPECULATING\nAS TO WHAT THE VIDEO WILL ACTUALLY SHOW.\nBUT WHAT I'M -- WHAT I'M CONTINUE TO EMPHASIZE IS JUST\nLIKE THE FOP REPRESENTATIVE SAID, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN SEE\nDIFFERENT THINGS DIFFERENT WAYS. BUT AT THE BOTTOM OF IT IS THE\nFACT THAT THERE'S -- WE LIVE IN A TIME WHEN THERE'S SO LITTLE\nTRUST. SO SOMEONE CAN LOOK AT A VIDEO\nAND SEE SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN SOMEONE ELSE.\nBUT WE HAVE TO LET THE -- THE SYSTEM PLAY ITSELF OUT.\nI DON'T KNOW WHAT THE VIDEO SHOWS.\nYOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE VIDEO SHOWS.\nTHE OFFICER THAT SPOKE ONLY KNOWS WHAT ONE OF THE VIDEOS\nSHOWS. BUT WHEN YOU -- WHEN YOU ARE\nEXISTING IN THE -- THESE CONDITIONS AS WE HAVE NOW, IT'S\nA TINDER BOX AND I THINK THE MAYOR ROBERTS IS DOING A GREAT\nTIME TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT SHE WANTS TRANSPARENCY.\nSHE WANTS TO GET THOSE THINGS OUT.\nBUT SHE'S ALSO GOING TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT HOW SHE DOES IT.\nSHE UNDERSTANDS AS I DID IN BALTIMORE THAT IT'S A VOLATILE\nSITUATION EVERY MINUTE OF THE DAY WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS\nGOES ON. >> RIGHT.\nBUT HOW DOES CONTROLLING TRANSPARENCY INCREASE TRUST?\n>> IT'S NOT CONTROLLING TRANSPARENCY.\nTHEY'RE LOOKING THROUGH THE VIDEO.\nTHERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT -- WE'VE HEARD FROM THE POLICE\nCHIEF, FROM THE MAYOR, FROM THE POLICE UNION, AND YOU'VE\nACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT VIDEOS.\nTHEY ARE ANALYZING IT. THEY ARE DOING THE\nINVESTIGATION. THE PRIMARY FOCUS SHOULD BE ON\nMAKING SURE THAT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM HAS WHAT THEY\nNEED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE DETERMINATION ABOUT WHAT STEPS\nSHOULD BE TAKEN NEXT. >> RIGHT BUT IT'S NOT -- IT'S\nNOT THAT SIMPLE AS A THOROUGHNESS ANALYSIS HERE\nBECAUSE UNLIKE IN BALTIMORE YOU HAVE A STATE LAW PASSED HERE IN\nNORTH CAROLINA TO NOT ALLOW PUBLIC DISSEMINATION OF THE\nVIDEOS WHICH SOME ARGUE WAS A NOD TO THE POLICE ALTHOUGH I\nKNOW MANY POLICE WHO WANT VIDEO BROUGHT OUT THEY THINK IT HELPS\nTHEIR CASE. THAT LAW DOESN'T GO IN EFFECT\nUNTIL OCTOBER 1st. SO THERE'S NO OFFICIAL\nRESTRICTION ON THIS AND AGAIN, I KNOW PEOPLE CAN SEE THINGS\nDIFFERENT WAYS. WE DEAL WITH IT WITH EYEWITNESS\nTESTIMONY ALL THE TIME LET ALONE VIDEO.\nBUT THIS IS ABOUT TWO VERY DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS.\nONE IS HE'S READING A BOOK WAITING FOR HIS KID.\nTHE OTHER IS HE EXITED THE VEHICLE WITH A WEAPON.\nTHAT IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULDN'T BE SLICED SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS\nBY PERSPECTIVE, NO? >> I DON'T DISAGREE.\nBUT WE'RE ALSO PRESUPPOSING WHAT THAT VIDEO WILL SHOW.\nWHAT I'M SUGGESTING IS THAT THE -- THE -- THE -- WHERE WE\nARE AS A COUNTRY REQUIRES US TO DO THE WORK UNDERNEATH OF ALL OF\nTHAT. YES, WE NEED TO SEE THE VIDEO.\nYES, YOU KNOW, I DON'T HAVE AN OPINION ON THE LAW IN NORTH\nCAROLINA BECAUSE YOU KNOW IN BALTIMORE WE WORKED VERY HARD TO\nPUT BODY CAMERAS IN PLACE. WE WORKED TO MAKE SURE WORKED\nWITH THE ACLU WORKED WITH THE FOP WORKED WITH COMMUNITY GROUPS\nTO MAKE SURE THAT OUR RULES AND REGULATIONS ABOUT THOSE VIDEOS\nMADE IT POSSIBLE FOR THERE TO BE THE TYPE OF TRANSPARENCY THAT WE\nWANT TO SEE NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE.\nBUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT T THE -- THE FACT THAT WE ARE\nLIVING IN TIMES WHERE IT'S SO VOLATILE, WE HAVE TO GET WORKING\nON THOSE UNDERLIKE ISSUES IN ORDER TO PREVENT NUMBER ONE\nSOMETHING LIKE THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN, BUT WHAT ARE WE\nDOING ABOUT USE OF FORCE NATIONALLY?\nWHAT ARE WE DOING TO BRING COMMUNITY AND THE FOP TOGETHER\nAT THE TABLE TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE CAN WORK BETTER TOGETHER SO\nWE CAN HAVE THE SAFE COMMUNITIES THAT WE WANT.\nWE HAVE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS IN THIS COMMUNITY AROUND RACE\nAROUND POLICE COMMUNITY RELATIONS, AND IF WE'RE GOING TO\nCONTINUE TO PLAY THESE SORT OF THESE BLAME GAMES AND FOLLOW OH,\nIT'S TRANSPARENCY HERE. IT'S YOU KNOW, IT'S, IT'S THIS\nISSUE HERE INSTEAD OF REALLY FOCUSING ON THE SYSTEMIC ISSUES,\nWE'VE GOT TO GET TO WORK AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY BUT\nTHAT'S GOING TO BE HOW WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT THESE THESE\nINCIDENTS DON'T HAPPEN AGAIN IN THE FUTURE.\n>> THERE'S NO QUESTION MAYOR THAT EVERY TIME WE HAVE ONE OF\nTHESE CASES THEY'RE A REFLECTION OF A LOT OF OTHER PROBLEMS THAT\nLIE UNDERNEATH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR\nPERSPECTIVE. >> THANK YOU.\n>> DONALD TRUMP DRAWING CRITICISM FOR SAYING BLACK\nCOMMUNITIES ARE IN THEIR WORST SHAPE EVER.\nSO WE'LL LOOK AT THE FACTS. DOES HE HAVE A POINT OR IS HE\nFLAT WRONG?",

WELCOME AND THANK YOU SO MUCH\nFOR BEING WITH ME THIS MORNING. >> THANK YOU.\n>> THERE, THERE IS A FEAR THAT THIS RIOTING WILL HAPPEN AGAIN\nTONIGHT IN CHARLOTTE. SO WHAT DO YOU SAY AS MAYOR OF A\nCITY TO CALM THINGS DOWN? >> IT'S A VERY TOUGH SITUATION\nFOR ANY MAYOR TO BE IN. PARTICULARLY IN TODAY'S SOCIETY.\nWE KNOW THAT OUR COUNTRY IS AT A BOILING POINT WHEN IT COMES TO\nRACE RELATIONS. WHEN IT COMES TO POLICE\nCOMMUNITY RELATIONS. AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO STRIKE\nTHAT RIGHT BALANCE. THAT YOU WANT PEACE.\nYOU WANT THERE TO BE ORDER. AND YOU ALSO HAVE TO HONOR THE\nREQUEST OF THE FAMILIES. AND MR. SCOTT'S CASE THE FAMILY\nIS ASKING FOR PEACE. THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO LET THIS\nPROCESS, THE INVESTIGATION, MOVE FORWARD WITHOUT DESTRUCTION.\nI -- I PRAY, AND YOU KNOW, I BEG FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO WANT SOCIAL\nJUSTICE AND WANT PROGRESS THAT THAT THE -- THAT THEY ALLOW THAT\nPROCESS TO HAPPEN WITHOUT DESTROYING THE FABRIC OF THEIR\nCOMMUNITY. BECAUSE IN BALTIMORE WE SAW WHAT\nHAPPENED. SO MANY THINGS WERE DESTROYED,\nAND IT TOOK A LOT OF TIME AND A LOT OF MONEY AND A LOT OF\nHEARTACHE FROM COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO WERE UNABLE TO GET THEIR\nPRESCRIPTIONS. UNABLE TO GET FOOD.\nBECAUSE THE STORES WERE LOOTED. AND THEN THOSE -- THE LOOTERS\nARE GONE, AND THE COMMUNITY IS LEFT TO REBUILD.\nAND I JUST HOPE THAT -- THAT THERE'S PEACE IN CHARLOTTE SO\nTHE PROCESS CAN RUN ITS COURSE. AND SO WE CAN WORK AS A\nCOMMUNITY TO MAKE THINGS BETTER IN OUR COUNTRY.\n>> CHARLOTTE'S MAYOR JENNIFER ROBERTS, SHE'S GOING TO VIEW THE\nPOLICE VIDEO OF MR. SCOTT'S DEATH LATER TODAY.\nYOU ALSO DEALT WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS.\nWHAT WILL GO IN TO THE DECISION TO RELEASE THIS VIDEO?\n>> SO THEY'RE DEALING WITH LAWS THAT ARE DIFFERENT THAN\nBALTIMORE'S. I'M NOT SURE WHAT WOULD GO IN TO\nWHETHER OR NOT THEY WILL RELEASE IT.\nBASED ON THOSE LAWS. BUT I CAN SAY IN BALTIMORE WE\nWORK VERY HARD ON OUR BODY CAMERA POLICY WITH COMMUNITY\nLEADERS. WITH THE ACLU.\nWITH THE FOP, AND WITH OTHER ELECTED OFFICIALS TO MAKE SURE\nTHAT OUR REGULATIONS WHEN IT COMES TO THE BODY CAM VIDEO\nLEADS US TO A BETTER SENSE OF TRANSPARENCY.\nTHIS IS ALL ABOUT DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO REPAIR THE\nBROKEN RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE POLICE AND THE COMMUNITY AND\nANYTHING WE CAN DO IN BALTIMORE, IN CHARLOTTE, IN, YOU KNOW, IN\nCHICAGO, IN L.A., IN NEW YORK, EVERYWHERE ACROSS THIS COUNTRY\nTHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP REPAIR THAT RELATIONSHIP WE ARE GOING\nTO BE BETTER FOR IT. >> AND, AND, AND SOME SAY\nRELEASING THIS VIDEOTAPE IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF\nTRANSPARENCY, EARLIER THIS MORNING WE TALKED TO THE\nSPOKESPERSON FOR THE FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE TOM WALTHER, THE\nFRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE IN CHARLOTTE, HE ACTUALLY WACHLD\nTHE VIDEO OF WHAT WENT DOWN WITH MR. SCOTT, AND HERE'S WHAT HE\nHAD TO SAY ABOUT THAT VIDEO. >> MR. SCOTT WAS ARMED WHEN HE\nEXITED THE VEHICLE. A WEAPON WAS RECOVERED.\nA HANDGUN WAS RECOVERED ON THE SCENE NEXT TO MR. SCOTT.\nHE WAS SEATED IN WHEN HE WAS APPROACHED BUT WHEN HE EXITED\nTHAT VEHICLE, HE WAS GIVEN CLEAR COMMANDS TO DROP THE WEAPON, AND\nHE DID NOT DO THAT. SO HE WAS ARMED WHEN HE CAME OUT\nOF THAT VEHICLE AND REFUSED TO LISTEN TO OFFICERS.\n>> SO MR. SCOTT'S FAMILY IS SAYING, MR. SCOTT WAS SITTING IN\nHIS CAR AND HE WAS READING A BOOK AND HE DID NOT HAVE A GUN.\nSO UNLESS POLICE RELEASE THIS VIDEO HOW DO YOU GET PEOPLE IN\nCHARLOTTE, THOSE WHO ARE REALLY ANGRY, TO BELIEVE WHAT THE\nPOLICE ARE SAYING? >> SO WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE\nMULTIPLE VIDEOS, AND THE OFFICER THAT YOU JUST SPOKE TO SAW ONE\nVERSION OF THAT. WE TALK ABOUT THE VIDEO AND THE\nTRANSPARENCY AS THIS -- YOU KNOW, THIS WOULD BE MAGICALLY\nSOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS. IT WON'T.\nWE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE UNDERLIKE ISSUES.\nTHE SOCIAL JUSTICE ISSUES. THE FACT THAT IN TOO MANY\nCOMMUNITIES THERE IS A CLEAR SENSE THAT THERE IS A BIAS, A\nRACIAL BIAS, AGAINST AFRICAN-AMERICANS.\nWE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THOSE ISSUES IF WE THINK WE'RE GOING\nTO PREVENT SUCH VIOLENCE FROM ERUPTING IN THE FUTURE.\nPEOPLE HAVE TO HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT NO MATTER WHAT THE VIDEO\nSHOWS THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE JUSTICE.\nMY HOPE IS THAT LIKE AS I SAID IN CITIES ACROSS OUR COUNTRY WE\nCAN HAVE A NATIONAL DISCUSSION ABOUT THINGS LIKE RACIAL BIAS.\nABOUT THINGS LIKE USE OF FORCE POLICY IN OUR POLICE FORCE.\nIT IS THOSE BROADER ISSUES, THE UNDERLYING ISSUES THAT ARE\nFUELLING A LOT OF THE DISTRUST AND THE PUSH.\nYOU'RE SAYING IT'S THE CALL FOR THE VIDEO.\nIT'S REALLY A CALL FOR JUSTICE. A CALL FOR BLIND JUSTICE.\nIF YOU ARE INVOLVED IN A POLICE INTERACTION, THAT THAT\nINTERACTION SHOULDN'T BE SHADED BY THE SHADE OF YOUR SKIN.\nDLAT YOU WILL BE TREATED EQUALLY.\nWE CAN'T LOSE SIGHT OF THE NEED TO DO THE WORK IN THOSE AREAS.\n>> JUST A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU BEFORE YOU\nHAVE TO GO. YOU ISSUED A CURFEW IN\nBALTIMORE. THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT DOING\nTHAT IN CHARLOTTE. THE NATIONAL GUARD HAS BEEN\nCALLED IN TO CHARLOTTE BUT HASN'T BEEN ACTIVATED AS FAR AS\nI KNOW. THE NATIONAL GUARD WAS CALLED IN\nTO THE CITY OF BALTIMORE. ARE THOSE THE RIGHT MOVES MOVING\nFORWARD FOR THE CITY OF CHARLOTTE.\n>> I REFUSE TO SECOND-GUESS MAYOR ROBERTS.\nSHE IS ON THE GROUND. SHE HAS ACCESS TO INFORMATION\nTHAT THE MEDIA DOESN'T HAVE, THE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND DON'T HAVE.\nTHE SAME THING HAS HAPPENED IN BALTIMORE.\nYOU HAVE TO MAKE THOSE BEST JUDGMENTS BASED ON YOUR\nEXPERIENCE AND BASED ON WHAT YOU THINK IS BEST FOR THE CITIZENS\nTHAT YOU SERVE, AND YOUR COMMUNITY.\nI CAN SAY ASKING FOR IMPLEMENTING A CURFEW IS TOUGH.\nIT DEFINITELY QUELLED THE VIOLENCE AND GOT PEACE ON THE\nSTREETS IN BALTIMORE. BUT IT CAME AT A SIGNIFICANT\nCOST. THE COST TO THE COMMUNITY,\nWHETHER IT'S PEOPLE WHO COULDN'T GET TO AND FROM WORK OR\nBUSINESSES THAT HAD TO CLOSE AND THAT IMPACTED PEOPLE'S ABILITY\nTO PROVIDE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES, THERE ARE REAL\nCOSTS WHEN YOU DO THAT. AND THAT'S WHY I PRAY THAT THE\nPROTESTERS WHO WANT BETTER, LISTEN TO THE WORDS OF THE\nFAMILIES, THERE'S NEVER BEEN A FAMILY THAT HAS BEEN IMPACTED BY\nTHIS VIOLENCE OR IN CUSTODY DEATHS OR DEATH AT THE HANDS OF\nPOLICE WHO'VE ASKED FOR LOOTING. WHO'S ASKED FOR VIOLENCE.\nTHEY WANT PEACE. THEY WANT -- THEY WANT PEACEFUL\nPROTESTS SO WE CAN GET TO A BETTER PLACE.\nIT'S -- IT BREAKS MY HEART TO SEE THE DESTRUCTION THAT IS DONE\nIN THE CITY BECAUSE THAT DOESN'T DO ANY -- IT MAKES A BAD\nSITUATION A LOT A LOT WORSE. >> MAYOR STEPHANIE\nRAWLINGS-BLAKE OF BALTIMORE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH\nME THIS MORNING.",

OFFICERS IN RIOT GEAR FIRING\nFLASH GRENADES AT TEAR GAS FILLING THE AIR POLICE SAY ONE\nMAN WAS SHOT BY SOMEONE IN THE CROWD.\nHE REMAINS IN THE HOSPITAL THIS MORNING CLINGING TO LIFE.\nBUSINESSES IN THE HEART OF CHARLOTTE SUSTAINED DAMAGE.\nSOME WORKERS TOLD TO STAY HOME THIS MORNING.\nNORTH CAROLINA'S GOVERNOR DECLARING A STATE OF EMERGENCY.\n>> THEIR GOAL IS NOT TO CONTRIBUTE TO A DISCUSSION.\nTHEIR GOAL IS DESTRUCTION. AND ANARCHY AND THAT IS\nSOMETHING OUR NATION CANNOT ACCEPT.\n>> FOUR OFFICERS WERE HURT IN THE CHAOS LAST NIGHT.\nTHE QUESTION NOW HOW TO PREVENT ANOTHER NIGHT OF VIOLENCE.\nCNN'S POLO SAND VALVE IS AT POLICE HEADQUARTERS IN\nCHARLOTTE. THE MAYOR IS EXPECTED TO VIEW\nTHE TAPE VERY SOON YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WHAT WENT DOWN WHEN KEITH\nSCOTT WAS SHOT. WHEN MIGHT SHE VIEW THAT TAPE,\nPOLO? >> THAT'S STILL UNCLEAR.\nIN ABOUT AN HOUR OR SO YOU WILL HEAR FROM THE CITY'S MAYOR, THE\nCITY'S POLICE CHIEF, AND ALSO SEVERAL COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND\nTHAT IS ONE OF THE KEY QUESTIONS.\nHAS SHE ACTUALLY SEEN THAT FOOTAGE.\nWE UNDERSTAND AT LEAST ONE ANGLE THAT WE KNOW OF SO FAR WHICH IS\nTHE DASH CAM ANGLE OF THE ACTUAL SHOOTING THERE OF MR. SCOTT HERE\nAND WHEN YOU GET TO SPEAK TO SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS HERE IN THE\nCOMMUNITY INCLUDING AT LEAST ONE INDIVIDUAL WHO HAPPENS TO BE A\nMEMBER OF A POLICE UNIT THEY WILL TELL YOU THAT THE VIDEO\nTHERE DOES THAT LEAST GO ALONG WITH THE CLAIMS FROM THE POLICE\nDEPARTMENT, WHAT THEY CLAIM ACTUALLY TOOK PLACE, THAT\nMR. SCOTT WAS NOT COMPLYING. BUT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY\nWANT TO SEE THAT FOOTAGE FOR THEMSELVES BECAUSE YOU STILL\nHAVE TWO COMPETING VERSIONS OF THE STORY OF WHAT TOOK PLACE\nEARLIER THIS WEEK. AND SO UNTIL THAT HAPPENS, MANY\nIN THE COMMUNITY SAY THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO SEE THAT CALL\nFOR JUSTICE AND OF COURSE, THAT CALL TO HAVE THAT VIDEO SO AS WE\nWAIT TO HEAR FROM CITY OFFICIALS WE'LL BE WAITING TO SEE REALLY\nTO CONFIRM WHETHER OR NOT THAT FOOTAGE HAS ACTUALLY BEEN SEEN.\nWILL IT BE SEEN BY ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC, POSSIBLY A MEMBER OF\nSCOTT'S",

THE NFL TEAM THERE.\nTHE STADIUM IS LOCATED VERY NEAR WHERE THESE PROTESTS WENT DOWN\nLAST NIGHT AND THE NIGHT BEFORE. NOW THE CAROLINA PANTHERS ARE\nWONDERING IF THEY SHOULD MOVE THE GAME THAT IS SCHEDULED FOR\nSUNDAY AWAY FROM THE CHARLOTTE AREA.\nCAROLINA SET TO PLAY THE MINNESOTA VIKINGS.\nTHIS IS A STATEMENT FROM THE PANTHERS' PRESIDENT, WHO SAYS\nQUOTE, WE ARE IN CONTACT WITH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.\nTHE CHARLOTTE MECKLENBURG POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE NFL.\nWE ARE CONTINUING TO MONITOR EVENTS AS WE PREPARE FOR\nSUNDAY'S HOME GAME. SO NO DECISION YET BUT THEY ARE,\nOF COURSE, TRYING TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY SHOULD HOLD THE\nGAME IN DOWNTOWN CHARLOTTE. ALL RIGHT.\nWITH ME NOW IS FORMER PHILADELPHIA MAYOR MICHAEL\nNUTTER. HE'S DEALT WITH THESE KINDS OF\nPROBLEMS BEFORE IN THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA.\nI'M EAGER TO GET YOUR PERSPECTIVE.\nFIRST, LET'S START WITH THIS BREAKING NEWS THAT THE CAROLINA\nPANTHERS ARE ACTUALLY THINKING ABOUT MOVING THE GAME.\n>> WELL, YOU KNOW, I'M CERTAINLY IN NO POSITION TO ADVISE THE NFL\nBUT OBVIOUSLY, THESE ARE THE KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS THAT YOU\nHAVE TO HAVE, PRIMARILY FOR PUBLIC SAFETY PURPOSES, AT THE\nEND OF THE DAY THE NFL WILL FIGURE OUT HOW TO HAVE A GAME.\nWHAT WE ARE REALLY TALKING ABOUT IS COMMUNITY UNREST, LEGITIMATE\nCONCERNS THAT PEOPLE IN THE CHARLOTTE COMMUNITY HAVE WITH\nREGARD TO THEIR INTERACTION, THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR\nPOLICE DEPARTMENT. THESE ISSUES PLAY OUT ALL ACROSS\nTHE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE LARGER ISSUES HERE OF COURSE\nARE DO PEOPLE HAVE FAITH AND TRUST IN THEIR POLICE\nDEPARTMENT, WHEREVER THEY MAY LIVE.\nAND HOW DO THE POLICE VIEW PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY.\nFIRST AND FOREMOST, THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF OUR\nCITIZENS I THINK IN ANY CITY WANT TO HAVE GOOD, HONEST,\nPROFESSIONAL POLICE OFFICERS AS CIVILIANS WE DEPEND ON THE\nPOLICE TO DO THEIR JOB AND CERTAINLY TO PROTECT US WHEREVER\nWE MAY LIVE. AT THE SAME TIME, CERTAINLY THE\nOFFICERS OVERWHELMING MAJORITY WANT TO DO A GOOD JOB.\nTHEY WANT TO PROTECT AND SERVE. THEY WANT TO KNOW AT THE END OF\nTHE DAY THAT THEY MADE THEIR COMMUNITY SAFE, THEY SAVED\nSOMEONE'S LIFE, THEY PROVIDED SOME SERVICE.\nBUT IT IS CLEAR ACROSS AMERICA THAT THERE ARE CHALLENGES IN\nRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY AND THE POLICE AND\nTHAT'S WHERE BRINGING TOGETHER IN ANY CITY THE POLICE\nCOMMUNITY, THE RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY, THE BUSINESS\nCOMMUNITY, THE POLITICAL COMMUNITY, THE CIVIC COMMUNITY,\nTHE PHILANTHROPY COMMUNITY AS WELL, HOW DO YOU REBUILD ON ANY\nFOUNDATION OF TRUST SO THAT IF SOMETHING DOES HAPPEN, WE CAN\nCOMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER AND NOT HAVE FURTHER EITHER INJURY,\nLOSS OF LIFE, DAMAGE TO PROPERTY --\n>> IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO -- >> -- THE KIND OF THINGS GOING\nON. IT DOES BUT YOU HAVE TO START.\n>> IN YOUR MIND, WHAT SHOULD THE MAYOR SAY?\n>> WELL, AGAIN, I DON'T USUALLY GIVE MAYORS ADVICE ON\nTELEVISION. MAYOR ROBERTS, YOU KNOW, RAN FOR\nOFFICE, SHE'S IN OFFICE AND CERTAINLY KNOWS WHAT TO DO.\nIN PHILADELPHIA, IN MANY INSTANCES WHERE WE FACED SOME\nCHALLENGES, YOU HAVE TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER.\nPEOPLE WANT TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE LAYING OUT ALL THE FACTS,\nCERTAINLY AS YOU KNOW THEM. YOU CAN RELEASE WHATEVER\nINFORMATION YOU CAN AT THE TIME. EVERY JURISDICTION HAS DIFFERENT\nRULES AND REGULATIONS. BUT WHAT PEOPLE WANT IS THE\nTRUTH. THEY WANT THE HONEST FACTS AND\nTHEN WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO NEXT, HOW DO YOU BRING PEOPLE\nBACK TOGETHER. AS YOU SAID, YES, IT DOES TAKE\nSOME TIME BUT AS I SAY, A JOURNEY OF A THOUSAND MILES\nBEGINS WITH ONE STEP. YOU HAVE TO START THAT PROCESS,\nCONTINUE THAT PROCESS AND DEMONSTRATE TO PEOPLE THAT YOU\nREALLY DO CARE ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON BUT THAT YOU ARE ALSO\nLISTENING, LISTENING TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE OUT IN THE STREET.\nWHAT ARE YOUR REAL CONCERNS, HOW CAN WE BE HELPFUL.\nOBVIOUSLY WE ARE NOT GOING TO TOLERATE DAMAGE AND VIOLENCE AND\nINJURY AND THOSE KINDS OF BEHAVIORS, BUT HOW CAN WE BEST\nPARTNER, HOW CAN WE WORK TOGETHER AND HEAL OUR PARTICULAR\nCOMMUNITIES. >> WOULD A FIRST STEP BE TOTAL\nTRANSPARENCY AS FAR AS RELEASING THAT VIDEOTAPE OF THAT INITIAL\nINCIDENT BETWEEN POLICE AND MR. SCOTT?\nWOULD THAT BE A GOOD FIRST STEP? >> AGAIN, NOT KNOWING THE RULES\nAND WHERE THEY ARE IN THEIR INVESTIGATION PROCESS, BUT\nCLEARLY, IT WILL BE HELPFUL WHETHER THEY DO IT TODAY OR\nTOMORROW OR WHENEVER THEY ARE ALLOWED TO DO IT OR CAN DO IT,\nRELEASING VIDEO OFTEN HELPS TO AT LEAST ANSWER SOME INITIAL\nQUESTIONS BUT I HAVE ALSO SEEN SITUATIONS WHERE THE RELEASE OF\nVIDEO THEN JUST RAISED MORE QUESTIONS FOR WHICH YOU MAY NOT\nHAVE ANSWERS AT THAT MOMENT. MORE OFTENTIMES THAN NOT, IT IS\nHELPFUL TO RELEASE WHAT YOU CAN RELEASE TO THE PUBLIC SO PEOPLE\nKNOW THAT YOU ARE BEING OPEN, BEING HONEST, ARE GOING TO BE\nHELD TO A STANDARD OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND YOU ARE GOING\nTO HOLD YOUR GOVERNMENT TO ACCOUNTABLE LEVELS AS WELL.\n>> THIS IS THE LEVEL OF DISTRUST IN THE COMMUNITY RIGHT NOW.\nSOMEBODY ON THE STREET WAS SHOT LAST NIGHT.\nHE'S IN THE HOSPITAL IN CRITICAL",

SEVERAL HUNDRED MORE PEOPLE.\nYES. >> WE WILL TAKE TWO MORE\nQUESTIONS. >> Reporter: YOU SAID SEVERAL\nTIMES TODAY THAT SAFETY IS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY [ INAUDIBLE ].\nWHAT DO YOU SAY TO PEOPLE, HOW DO YOU ASSURE THEM THE SAME\nTHING ISN'T GOING TO HAPPEN TONIGHT?\n>> I THINK YOU HEARD THE CHIEF SAY VERY CLEARLY WE HAVE\nADDITIONAL RESOURCES ON THE GROUND THAT WE ARE WORKING ON AS\nNEW STRATEGIC RESPONSE WILL ENSURE THAT SAFETY, EVERY\nSITUATION IS VOLATILE AND WE WILL DO AS MUCH AS WE CAN TO\nENSURE THAT SAFETY. WE CAN'T GUARANTEE, NOT KNOWING\nWHAT INCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN, WHAT GROUPS WILL BE GATHERED, BUT WE\nHAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE THAT WE ARE GOING TO PUT THE RESOURCES\nIN PLACE THAT ARE REQUIRED AND NEEDED, AND IT IS MY SINCERE\nHOPE, I REACH OUT TO THE COMMUNITY, I ASK FOR CONTINUED\nCONVERSATION, ALL THOSE LEADERS WHO HAVE REACHED OUT TO ME\nPERSONALLY, YOU ARE AMAZING AND THE MESSAGE YOU ARE CARRYING\nABOUT NON-VIOLENCE.

THANK YOU.\n>> JOHN BERMAN ALONG WITH KATE BOLDUAN, WATCHING A NEWS\nCONFERENCE FROM CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA.\nMAYOR JENNIFER ROBERTS ALONG WITH POLICE CHIEF PUTNEY\nUPDATING THE SITUATION IN THAT CITY AFTER A NIGHT OF VIOLENCE\nAND PROTESTS. THERE WILL BE AN INCREASED LAW\nENFORCEMENT PRESENCE ON THE STREET TONIGHT.\nTHAT WAS A BIG PART OF WHAT THEY SAID BUT ALSO A COUPLE OTHER\nMAJOR HEADLINES. NUMBER ONE, THE FAMILY OF MR.\nSCOTT, THE MAN WHO WAS KILLED BY A POLICE OFFICER, HAS REQUESTED\nTO SEE THE VIDEO OF THIS SHOOTING AND THE POLICE CHIEF\nINDICATED THAT THEY ARE LOOKING TO ACCOMMODATE THAT REQUEST.\n>> ALSO, ANOTHER BIG HEADLINE COMING OUT FROM THE POLICE\nCHIEF, HE SAYS THE VIDEO THAT HE HAS SEEN IN HIS WORDS, DOES NOT\nGIVE ABSOLUTE DEFINITIVE VISUAL EVIDENCE THAT WOULD CONFIRM A\nPERSON WAS POINTING A GUN. THAT MAY BE A VERY BIG POINT OF\nCONTENTION AND A VERY BIG PART OF THE CONVERSATION GOING\nFORWARD. HE ALSO SAID THAT AT THIS POINT\nTHEY DO NOT SEE THE NEED TO SHUT DOWN THE CITY OR PUT IN PLACE A\nCURFEW AS THEY ANTICIPATE EVENTS.\n>> OR RELEASE THE VIDEO PUBLICLY.\nWE SHOULD SAY THAT, TOO. THEY WANT TO ACCOMMODATE THE\nFAMILY'S REQUEST BUT NO PLANS TO MAKE WHATEVER VIDEO EVIDENCE\nTHERE IS AVAILABLE TO THE WIDER PUBLIC.\n>> FACING TOUGH QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT.\nLET'S DISCUSS THIS, KIND OF WHAT WE JUST HEARD IN THIS PRESS\nCONFERENCE, IN THIS UPDATE, WITH THE FORMER MAYOR OF\nPHILADELPHIA, MAYOR MICHAEL NUTTER, WHO IS JOINING US NOW.\nMAYOR, WE WANTED TO GET YOUR TAKE ON HOW YOU THINK THE CITY'S\nHANDLING THIS SO FAR. >> WELL, KATE AND JOHN, THANKS\nFOR HAVING ME. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A TOUGH AND\nCOMPLICATED SITUATION. I DO WANT TO SAY I THINK THAT\nMAYOR ROBERTS AND CHIEF PUTNEY, WITH REGARD TO ACCOMMODATING THE\nFAMILY'S REQUEST TO SEE THE VIDEO, ABSOLUTE RIGHT DECISION,\nAND YOU KNOW, THE CHIEF DESCRIBED WHAT HE SAW AND YOU\nKNOW, IF THE FAMILY SEES THE SAME THING, IT MAY NOT PROVIDE\nTHEM WITH ANY DEFINITIVE CLOSURE TO WHAT HAS HAPPENED BUT AT\nLEAST THEY WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THE SAME\nTHING THAT THE CHIEF HAS SEEN. THESE KINDS OF SITUATIONS ARE\nTHE TOUGHEST. THEY ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS\nTHAT MAYORS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY WORRY ABOUT EVERY DAY.\nANY OF US KNOW THAT ON ANY GIVEN DAY, IN ANY GIVEN INCIDENT,\nTHINGS CAN QUITE HONESTLY GO SIDEWAYS OR HAYWIRE AND YOU CAN\nEND UP IN ONE OF THESE TOUGH SITUATIONS.\nSO AS THE CHIEF INDICATED, THERE MAY BE AN OUTSIDE INVESTIGATION\nWHICH IN THIS KIND OF CIRCUMSTANCE, IS THE APPROPRIATE\nWAY TO GO. I DON'T KNOW THE RULES IN\nCHARLOTTE OR IN NORTH CAROLINA OR WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\nMAY REQUIRE IF THE FEDS ARE THE OUTSIDE THIRD PARTY TO\nINVESTIGATE. ON THE ONE HAND, YOU NEED TO\nFOLLOW THE RULES AND REGULATIONS.\nON THE OTHER HAND, OBVIOUSLY THE PUBLIC AND THE MEDIA WANT AS\nMUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE. >> MR. MAYOR, AS YOU HEAD INTO\nTHURSDAY NIGHT AFTER TWO NIGHTS OF VIOLENCE THERE, WE LEARNED\nTHAT THEY HAVE NO PLANS AS OF NOW TO INSTITUTE A CURFEW,\nALTHOUGH THE CHIEF SAID IT'S SOMETHING THEY MAY DO LATER ON.\nWHAT GOES INTO A DECISION LIKE THAT, AND DO YOU THINK IT'S\nSOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE DONE? >> THERE'S TOO MUCH ADVICE ON\nTELEVISION BUT THAT IS A TOUGH CALL, AND YOU KNOW, THEY ARE\nGOING TO HAVE MUCH MORE INFORMATION ON THE GROUND\nCERTAINLY THAN ANY OF US WOULD HAVE IN OUR CONVERSATION.\nBUT I THINK AFTER SEEING WHAT'S HAPPENED THE LAST COUPLE NIGHTS,\nANTICIPATING NOW WITH THE STATE DECLARATION, STATE OF EMERGENCY,\nNATIONAL GUARDSMEN, STATE TROOPERS, I UNDERSTAND, OR\nHIGHWAY PATROL, THOSE OFFICERS, BRINGING IN THAT LEVEL OF\nADDITIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENGAGEMENT WILL UNFORTUNATELY\nPOSSIBLY INSPIRE SOME TO DO EVEN MORE THINGS.\nI THINK AS THE MAYOR INDICATED, SHE SAID A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS\nARE TAKING PLACE RIGHT NOW WITH MANY, MANY COMMUNITY LEADERS.\nI'M SURE THEY WILL HAVE MORE DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT THEY\nSHOULD REALLY DO FOR LATE THIS AFTERNOON, EARLY EVENING AND\nTHEY MAY WANT TO REVISIT A LOT OF THAT DISCUSSION AND\nDECISION-MAKING. MAKING SURE THAT THE PUBLIC IS\nSAFE. MAKING SURE THAT THE OFFICERS\nARE SAFE. AND THEN OF COURSE, PROPERTY AND\nPROPERTY DAMAGE, ET CETERA, ET CETERA, ARE ALL THE FACTORS IN\nTRYING TO MAKE THAT VERY VERY TOUGH CALL.\nI THINK PUBLIC SAFETY ALWAYS HAS TO BE THE NUMBER ONE LEADING\nCHOICE IN TERMS OF THAT DECISION.\n>> MAYOR, STAND BY. LET'S GO TO BRIAN TODD, OUR\nCORRESPONDENT, WHO WAS IN THAT PRESS CONFERENCE THERE IN\nCHARLOTTE. BRIAN, YOU WERE THERE AND YOU\nHEARD OBVIOUSLY EVEN MORE OF THE QUESTIONS THAN WE COULD HEAR\nBECAUSE THERE WAS SOME, YOU KNOW, YOU COULDN'T HEAR THEM OFF\nMIC BUT THE MAYOR AND THE POLICE CHIEF FACED SOME VERY TOUGH\nQUESTIONS ABOUT WHY RELEASE, WHY NOT RELEASE THIS VIDEO TO THE\nPUBLIC. >> Reporter: THEY FACED VERY\nTOUGH QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT. MY COLLEAGUE NICK VALENCIA AND I\nPRESSED THEM ON IT REPEATEDLY. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO RELEASE\nTHE VIDEO, THEY HAVE NO PLANS TO RELEASE IT PUBLICLY, THEY SAY\nTHEIR POLICY IS NOT TO RELEASE THE VIDEO.\nAT ONE POINT, THE CHIEF HINTED THAT HE MAY HAVE A THIRD PARTY\nINDIVIDUAL LOOK AT IT AND MAYBE TRY TO DISSEMINATE THAT FOR THE\nPUBLIC BUT HE WAS NONCOMMITTAL ON THAT.\nWE PRESSED HIM ON THAT AS WELL AND HE BASICALLY SAID DON'T\nEXPECT THE VIDEO TO BE RELEASED. WE PRESSED HIM, LOOK, JUST TELL\nUS WHAT'S ON IT IF YOU CAN. HE WOULDN'T DO THAT.\nMY COLLEAGUE NICK VALENCIA SAID HIS TEAM INTERVIEWED AN OFFICIAL\nWHO LOOKED AT THE VIDEO, WHO SAID THERE WAS A CLEARLY\nTHREATENING MOVE MADE BY KEITH LAMONT SCOTT THAT AFTERNOON, AND\nTHAT HE HAD AN ANKLE HOLSTER. WE ASKED THE CHIEF ABOUT THAT.\nHE WOULDN'T COMMENT ABOUT ANY OF THAT.\nTHE HEADLINE HERE, THEY ARE BEING VERY CLOSE-MOUTHED THIS\nMORNING ABOUT WHAT'S ON THE VIDEO AND THEY DO NOT PLAN TO\nRELEASE IT. THE CHIEF ALSO NOTABLY SAYING\nTHAT HE DOES NOT PLAN ON USING THE CURFEW BUT HE WILL LEAVE\nTHAT OPEN LATER ON, HE MAY HAVE TO MAKE THAT CALL LATER.\nWE ARE WONDERING JUST HOW MUCH LATER HE WOULD MAKE IT BECAUSE\nIT SEEMS LIKE THEY WERE LATE IN ASKING FOR ASSISTANCE FROM OTHER\nPOLICE AGENCIES AS WELL TO COME IN AND HELP QUELL THE VIOLENCE\nOVERNIGHT. >> BRIAN TODD, STAND BY FROM\nTHAT BRIEFING ROOM. WANT TO BRING IN ART RODERICK,\nCNN LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST, FORMER ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF THE\nU.S. MARSHAL'S SERVICE. WE HEARD FROM BRIAN RIGHT THERE,\nSOURCES WERE TELLING CNN THAT KEITH LAMONT SCOTT MADE SOME\nKIND OF THREATENING MOVE. THAT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT THE\nPOLICE CHIEF SAID JUST THERE. WHAT HE SAID IS HE LOOKED AT THE\nVIDEO AND THERE WAS NO ABSOLUTE EVIDENCE HE SAW THAT MR. SCOTT\nPOINTED A GUN. IS THERE AN IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE\nBETWEEN SEEING HIM POINT A GUN AND HAVING A GUN?\n>> WELL, IF HE HAD THE GUN IN HIS HAND AND EVEN THOUGH HE\nDIDN'T POINT IT, TO ME IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE.\nUNFORTUNATELY, WE HAVE HEARD SOME CONFLICTING VIEWS OF WHAT\nIS ACTUALLY ON THIS VIDEO. WE HAVE ONE OFFICIAL SAYING HE\nMADE A THREATENING MOVE INITIALLY WHEN WE HEARD THE\nCHIEF COME OUT A COUPLE DAYS AGO, I BELIEVE THERE WAS\nREFERENCE TO A GUN IN HIS HAND. SO I'M NOT QUITE SURE IF THIS\nVIDEO, THE RELEASE OF THE VIDEO IS GOING TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS\nAT ALL OR RAISE MORE QUESTIONS. I THINK REALLY, I THINK THE\nCHIEF IS IN SOME OF THE SPEAKERS I HAVE HEARD EARLIER ARE\nPROBABLY CORRECT THAT EVEN IF THEY RELEASE THE VIDEO AT THIS\nPOINT IT'S NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO WHAT HAPPENS IN\nTHE CITY OF CHARLOTTE AND TO THE COMMUNITY AT THIS POINT IN TIME.\nWOULD IT HAVE -- WOULD THE RELEASE OF THE VIDEO EARLIER ON\nDONE SOMETHING? I DON'T THINK WE ARE GOING TO\nKNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION.\n>> A LOT MORE QUESTIONS SWIRLING RIGHT NOW THAN THERE ARE\nANSWERS. ART, IF YOU CAN STAND BY AS\nWELL. WE WANT TO GO TO PAOLO SANDOVAL\nWHO HAS BEEN FOLLOWING THIS STORY FROM THE BEGINNING.\nHE HAS NEW INFORMATION ABOUT KEITH LAMONT SCOTT, THE MAN WHO\nWAS KILLED BY POLICE. >> Reporter: RIGHT.\nIT CAN AT LEAST HELP US BUILD A BETTER PICTURE HERE OF KEITH\nSCOTT. WE CAN NOW CONFIRM AFTER TAKING\nA CLOSER LOOK AT COURT RECORDS THAT SCOTT DID IN FACT HAVE A\nCRIMINAL HISTORY. HE DID SERVE TIME AFTER BEING\nCONVICTED OF AGGRAVATED ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY WEAPON AND ALSO\nEVADING ARREST. A CLOSER LOOK AT THE COURT\nRECORDS SHOWING THAT SCOTT ACTUALLY PLEADED NO CONTEST TO\nSHOOTING A MAN IN TEXAS BACK IN 2002.\nA JUDGE EVENTUALLY SENTENCED SCOTT TO SEVEN YEARS IN PRISON\nFOR THAT ASSAULT CHARGE AND ABOUT A YEAR IN PRISON OR SO FOR\nTHAT EVADING ARREST CHARGE. WE ARE DISCUSSING THIS FOR TWO\nREASONS. BECAUSE IT NOW TELLS US THAT\nSCOTT DID IN FACT AT LEAST HAVE A PAST AS A VIOLENT OR AT LEAST\nA VIOLENT CONVICTION IN HIS CRIMINAL HISTORY AND IT ALSO IS\nIMPORTANT HERE BECAUSE STATE LAW PREVENTS OR AT LEAST IT CALLS IT\nUNLAWFUL FOR A CONVICTED FELON TO BE IN POSSESSION OF A\nFIREARM. WE NOW HAVE SEVERAL VERSIONS NOW\nSUGGESTING THAT THERE WAS A GUN AT THE SCENE, THAT MR. SCOTT DID\nHAVE IN HIS POSSESSION. OBVIOUSLY THAT WOULD BE\nIMPORTANT. IT DOES NOT, HOWEVER, JUSTIFY\nTHE DEATH OF THIS INDIVIDUAL BY ANY MEANS.\nTHIS IS SIMPLY ONE OF SEVERAL PIECES IN WHAT IS A VERY\nCOMPLEX, VERY EMOTIONAL PUZZLE HERE.\nTHE OTHER PIECE OF COURSE, THAT VIDEO THAT WE MAY NOT\nNECESSARILY EVER SEE PUBLICLY. SO THIS AGAIN, IT'S IMPORTANT TO\nKEEP IN MIND WE NOW KNOW KEITH SCOTT DID HAVE AT LEAST A\nVIOLENT PAST GOING BACK TO 2002 WHEN HE WAS CONVICTED OF\nAGGRAVATED ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY WEAPON.\n>> BUT JOHN, AS YOU WELL POINT OUT, THIS IS A VERY SENSITIVE\nISSUE, WHEN A RECORD HAS COME UP IN THE PAST REGARDING SOMEONE'S\nPAST RECORD AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THEM IN THE PRESENT.\n>> LET'S PUT THAT QUESTION TO CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST,\nCEDRIC ALEXANDR, WHO JOINS US RIGHT NOW.\nYOU HEARD THAT REPORT FROM POLO BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS,\nWE HAVE NO EVIDENCE THAT THE POLICE WHO PULLED INTO THAT\nPARKING LOT HAD ANY IDEA WHAT KEITH SCOTT'S PAST WAS.\nWE HAVE NO NOTION THAT THEY HAD ANY IDEA THAT HE HAD BEEN A\nFELON AND SHOULDN'T HAVE A WEAPON, IF HE DID.\nTHEY HAD A WARRANT FOR SOMEONE ELSE.\nTHAT'S NOT WHY THEY WERE THERE. THAT DOES NOT SPEAK TO THEIR\nSTATE OF MIND WHEN THEY PULLED THAT TRIGGER AND SHOT HIM, DOES\nIT? >> NO, IT DOES NOT.\nLET ME SAY THIS. BEING A CHIEF OF POLICE\nADMINISTRATOR IN THIS ENVIRONMENT IS VERY TOUGH AND\nCERTAINLY IT'S TOUGH THERE FOR THAT CHIEF IN CHARLOTTE AND\nACROSS THE COUNTRY. BUT WHEN WE START TO RECEIVE\nINFORMATION ABOUT SOMEONE'S CRIMINAL PAST, WE HAVE TO BE\nVERY, VERY CAREFUL WHEN WE INSERT THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE\nIT COMES ACROSS AS BEING DEFENSIVE.\nWE DON'T WANT TO COME ACROSS AS BEING DEFENSIVE.\nTHAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU GUYS ARE ALLUDING TO.\nTHAT'S WHAT YOU OFTENTIMES HEAR, PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY SAY.\nWE HAVE A CASE INVOLVING A SUBJECT BUT THEN SOMEHOW, THE\nCRIMINAL PAST IS BROUGHT INTO PLAY.\nNOW, IN TERMS FROM AN INVESTIGATIVE POINT OF VIEW,\nTHAT IS -- COULD BE CERTAINLY VERY RELEVANT INFORMATION.\nHOWEVER, WHEN WE ARE TRYING, THROUGH THE COURSE OF THIS\nINVESTIGATION, WHERE IT'S BEING VIEWED OUT HERE IN THE PUBLIC\nBOTH IN CHARLOTTE AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD,\nWHEN YOU INSERT THAT TYPE OF INFORMATION, YOU HAVE TO BE VERY\nCAREFUL TO SEPARATE IT FROM WHAT WE KNOW HAPPENED UP TO THIS\nPOINT BECAUSE THE PERCEPTION IS GOING TO BE FROM A GROUP OF\nPEOPLE WHO ARE VERY FRUSTRATED, VERY ANGRY, VERY MAD ABOUT\nWHAT'S GOING ON ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND QUITE FRANKLY, VERY\nFRIGHTENED BECAUSE INSERTING THAT IS TO SAY HEY, HE WAS A\nCRIMINAL ANYWAY, AND HE MAY HAVE HAD A CRIMINAL PAST BUT WE HAVE\nTO LOOK AT THE RELEVANCY OF THESE CASES AND WHEN WE INSERT\nTHAT INFORMATION. SO THAT EVERYTHING MAINTAINS A\nSENSE OF BALANCE AND TRANSPARENCY.\n>> IT'S IMPORTANT, WHAT HE WAS OR WAS NOT DOING AT THAT MOMENT\nAND WHAT THE POLICE THERE WERE OR WERE NOT DOING AT THAT\nMOMENT. CEDRIC ALEXANDER, IMPORTANT\nCONTEXT. THANKS SO MUCH.\n>> THANK YOU. >> LET'S GO TO RYAN YOUNG, ON\nTHE GROUND IN CHARLOTTE. WHAT ARE YOU SEEING?\nWE HAVE HEARD FROM THE GOVERNOR THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE\nMOBILIZING THE NATIONAL GUARD. WHERE IS THE NATIONAL GUARD\nPRESENCE? ARE YOU SEEING IT NOW?\n>> Reporter: WE HAVEN'T SEEN THEM JUST YET.\nWE ARE TOLD THEY WILL PROTECT INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEY WILL\nSHOW UP EN MASSE SO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT\nWILL NOT HAPPEN. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS HEAVY\nPOLICE PRESENCE YOU CAN SEE AT ALMOST EVERY CORNER.\nWE HAVE SEEN THEM GROUPED AND GATHERED AND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN\nTALKING TO THEM SAYING HELLO AND YOU HAVE SEEN DISCUSSIONS\nBETWEEN THE POLICE OFFICERS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT STICKS\nOUT TO US, YOU STILL SEE PEOPLE WALKING DOWN THE STREETS WITH\nSIGNS LIKE THIS. THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THEIR\nVOICES ARE HEARD. THIS HAS NOT GONE AWAY IN TERMS\nOF THE CONVERSATION THAT'S BEING HAD IN THIS COMMUNITY.\nTHEN WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT A BUILDING LIKE THIS THAT WAS\nLOOTED, YOU CAN SEE HOW THIS STORE WAS DAMAGED AND THE PEOPLE\nWHO WERE INSIDE, WHO OWN THIS PLACE, THEY HAVE HAD THIS HAPPEN\nTO THEM BEFORE. IN FACT, IT HAPPENED TO THEM\nWHILE THEY WERE IN L.A. NOW THEY HAVE HAD THIS HAPPEN\nAGAIN. PEOPLE FROM THE COMMUNITY HAVE\nACTUALLY SHOWN AUP AND TRIED TO HELP.\nTALKING TO SOMEONE ELSE WHO WAS TRAPPED INSIDE A BAR LAST NIGHT,\nHE SAID THEY THOUGHT THEY HEARD GUN SHOTS AND HAD TO LOCK THE\nDOOR. ABOUT 25 PEOPLE GOT DOWN ON THE\nGROUND AND MADE SURE THEY WERE SAFE FOR THE NIGHT.\nONCE AGAIN, THE CONVERSATION IS STILL HAPPENING IN THIS CITY.\nPEOPLE ARE KIND OF BRACING THEMSELVES TO SEE WHAT WILL\nHAPPEN OVERNIGHT. >> COULD BE A LONG NIGHT AGAIN.\nRYAN YOUNG IN CHARLOTTE, THANKS",

ABSOLUTELY, MA'AM.\nSEVERAL HUNDRED MORE PEOPLE, YES.\n>> TWO MORE QUESTIONS, JIM. [INAUDIBLE]\n>> YOU SAID SEVERAL TIMES TODAY THAT SAFETY IS THE HIGHERS\nPRIORITY -- [INAUDIBLE]\n>> WHAT DO YOU SAY TO PEOPLE -- >> I THINK YOU'VE HEARD OUR\nCHIEF SAY CLEARLY WE HAVE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ON THE\nGROUNDS THAT WE ARE WORKING ON AS NEW STRATEGIC RESPONSE THAT\nWILL ENSURE THAT SAFETY. EVERY SITUATION IS VOLATILE AND\nWE WILL DO AS MUCH AS WE CAN TO ENSURE THAT SAFETY.\nWE CAN'T GUARANTY NOT KNOWING WHAT INCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN, WHAT\nGROUPS WILL BE GATHERED, BUT WE HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE THAT WE\nARE GOING TO PUT THE RESOURCES IN PLACE THAT ARE REQUIRED AND\nNEEDED AND IT IS MY SINCERE HOPE.\nI REACH OUT TO THE COMMUNITY, I ASK FOR CONTINUED CONVERSATION,\nALL LEADERS THAT HAVE REACHED OUT TO ME, YOU'RE AMAZING AND\nTHE MESSAGE THAT YOU'RE CARRYING ABOUT NONVIOLENCE AND I HAVE\nFAITH THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO PROGRESS.\n[INAUDIBLE] >> WE HAVE SEEN SOCIAL MEDIA\nTHAT HAS MADE THOSE IMITATIONS, I DON'T HAVE ANY WAY TO EVALUATE\nHOW MUCH THAT WAS A PART OF WHAT WENT ON.\nWE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO GET INFORMATION ON THAT.\n>> FINAL QUESTION, ERIC.

MARTHA: WE JUST HEARD FROM THE\nMAYOR AND POLICE CHIEF AFTER A NIGHT OF PROTEST THAT THEN\nTURNED INTO RIOTS AND VIOLENCE AS WELL.\nA FEW HEADLINES FROM THE PRESS CONFERENCE TODAY.\nNO CURFEW IN CHARLOTTE TONIGHT ALTHOUGH THERE WERE 44 ARRESTS\nLAST NIGHT AND THE POLICE CHIEF SAID THEY WILL BE MORE ACTIVE\nTONIGHT TO KEEP CONTROL OF THE STREETS IN CHARLOTTE.\nIN THE MEANTIME THE OTHER HEADLINE, THE VIDEO THAT WAS\nDASH CAM, THE POLICE SAID WILL NOT BE RELEASING TO THE PUBLIC\nBEFORE SHOWING TO THE FAMILY. WE HAVE HEARD FROM POLICE THAT\nHE HAD A GUN BUT NOW APPARENTLY IT DOES NOT SHOW HIM POINTING\nTHE GUN. WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE\nWHAT EXACTLY THE VIDEO SHOWS IF THE POLICE CHIEF, INDEED,\nBELIEVES SHE WILL RELEASE IT LATER ON.\nMORE ON WHAT'S TRANSPIRING TODAY, JONATHAN.\n>> HI, JENNA, WELL, TODAY BUSINESS OWNERS ARE COMING BACK\nAND INSPECTING THE DAMAGE BEHIND THESE FAMILY-OWNED VARIETY STORE\nTHAT WAS HIT OVERNIGHT. FORTUNATELY NO ONE INSIDE OF THE\nSTORE BUT THE OWNERS WANTED TO WAIT UNTIL DAYLIGHT, MOST THINGS\nOF VALUE WERE TAKEN OVERNIGHT. OTHER BUSINESSES WERE HIT AS\nWELL DURING THE PROTEST, THE PROTEST HAD STARTED OUT AS A\nPEACEFUL RALLY IN MARSHALL PARK AND THE PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATORS,\nMANY OF THEM WENT TO LOCAL CHURCH, OTHER PROTESTORS STAYED\nBEHIND PROTESTING IN THE STREETS AND SMALLER GROUP OF THEM\nCLASHING WITH POLICE. NOW, ALL OF THE PROTESTS STEM\nFROM THE TUESDAY POLICE SHOOTING OF KEITH LAMONT SCOTT AND WHAT'S\nEMERGED FROM THIS IS TWO VERY DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF REALITY.\nSOME OF THE PROTESTORS CLAIM THAT IT WAS A WHITE COP SHOOTING\nA BLACK MAN WHO WAS UNARMED. POLICE, THOUGH, SAY THAT IT WAS\nAN AFRICAN-AMERICAN POLICE OFFICER WHO SHOT IN\nSELF-DEFENSE, THAT THIS WAS AN ARMED MAN THREATENING OFFICERS.\nTHEY SAY THERE WAS DASH CAM VIDEO AND POLICE BODY CAM VIDEO\nTHAT CORROBORATES. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO RELEASE TO\nGENERAL PUBLIC BUT THEY ARE TRYING TO HAVE A VIEWING FOR\nFAMILY MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY THAT WAS SHOT TO GRANT THEIR\nREQUEST. I HAVE STILL PICTURES THAT WERE\nTAKEN OUTSIDE OF THIS BUSINESS WHERE WE ARE.\nTHIS MORNING CHARLOTTE MECKLENBURG POLICE OFFICERS CAME\nTO THIS BUSINESS INITIALLY TO ASK QUESTIONS TO TRY TO FIND OUT\nWHO IS RESPONSIBLE AND WHEN THEY COMPLETED THE INVESTIGATION,\nOFFICERS, THEY GOT OUT A BROOM AND THEY BEGAN REPAIRING THE\nWINDOWS, THE DOORS OUT IN FRONT AND IF YOU COME BACK TO MY LIVE\nSHOT, YOU CAN SEE THERE ARE STILL TWO OFFICERS INSIDE THIS\nBUSINESS TRYING TO HELP THIS FAMILY REPAIR ALL THE DAMAGE\nFROM LAST NIGHT. JENNA.\nJENNA: BIG QUESTION ABOUT WHAT IS NEXT.\nJONATHAN, ONE OF THE BIG STORIES OF THE DAY.  INVESTIGATION IS\nONGOING AND GREG IS WITH US ON HAPPENING NOW.\nYOU WERE LISTENING TO THE POLICE CHIEF WITH YOUR LAW BACKGROUND.\nWHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS VIDEO NOT BEING RELEASED AND KEPT AT\nLEAST FROM THE PUBLIC FOR NOW? >> WELL, MAYBE A MISTAKE BECAUSE\nTHE POLICE CHIEF WAS QUESTIONED ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS DURING\nTHAT NEWS CONFERENCE WHY DON'T YOU RELEASE THE VIDEO TAPE AS\nSOON AS POSSIBLE TO AVOID AND DETER ANY FURTHER VIOLENCE.\nREMEMBER, THERE'S A MAN LYING LN HOSPITAL BED, SHOT LAST NIGHT IN\nCRITICAL CONDITION, HAD THAT VIDEO TAPE BEEN RELEASED EARLIER\nIN THE DAY YESTERDAY, ALL OF THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AVOIDED.\nCAMERAS DON'T GENERALLY LIE UNLESS THEY'RE ALTERED IN SOME\nFORM, ASSUMING THIS HASN'T BEEN, IT MIGHT PROVE THE POLICE THEORY\nTHAT THIS WAS A SHOOTING.\nREMEMBER, JUST HAVING A FIREARM IS NOT A CRIME.\nJENNA: ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT THAT NOW THAT PERHAPS THAT COULD\nBE IT, THAT IT DOESN'T SHOW ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY THE SHOOTING?\n>> AND THAT MAY BE WHY THE CHIEF OF POLICE IS RESDICENT.\nJENNA: INTERESTING. AT THIS TIME WE HAVE NO MORE\nINFORMATION OTHER THAN WHAT THE POLICE HAVE TOLD US.\nWE ARE GOING TO GO ON THAT AND CONTINUE TO WATCH THE SITUATION\nIN CHARLOTTE. IN THE MEANTIME, WE ARE GOING TO\nHAVE A FORMER MEMBER OF THE FBI JOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCE JOIN\nNEWS JUST A FEW MINUTES TALKING ABOUT THE STORY AND OTHER NEWS\nWE HAVE TODAY. >> WELL, WE ARE GOING TO MOVE\nONTO POLITICS NOW. HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP\nGO HEAD TO HEAD IN JUST A FEW DAYS AND THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL\nDEBATE IS SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE WATCHED VERY CLOSELY, BOTH\nNOMINEES HAVE BEEN PREPARING FOR WEEKS.\nIN FACT, HILLARY CLINTON ISN'T CAMPAIGNING TODAY IN ORDER TO\nPREP. ACCORDING TO NEXT GUEST, CLINTON\nWILL LIKELY FOCUS PERSUADING VOTERS TO BACK HER INSTEAD OF\nTHIRD-PARTY CANDIDATE, PERHAPS NOT MANY, BUT CERTAINLY A\nSEGMENT. IN THE END, HOW MUCH DO THE\nDEBATES MATTER? THERE'S BEEN AT LEAST ONE\nTELEVISED PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE EVERY FOUR YEARS, BEGAN IN 1976,\nEVERY FOUR YEARS THE DEBATE SEEMED IMPORTANT, WHETHER THEY\nARE OR NOT ARE OPEN TO DEBATE. LARRY, DIRECTOR AT THIS\nUNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. I DIDN'T ADD FOR DRAMATIC\nEFFECT. TRADITIONALLY YOU DON'T SEE\nDEBATES AS MOVING THE NEEDLE AT ALL?\n>> WELL, SOMETIMES THEY MOVE THE NEEDLE BUT OFTEN THEY MOVE IT\nONLY FOR A FEW DAYS OR A WEEK OR TEN DAYS AND THEN IT GOES BACK,\nTHE CAMPAIGN GOES BACK TO WHERE IT WAS AT LEAST IN THE POLL OR\nPOLLING AVERAGES. JENNA, I HAVE TO SAY ONE THING,\nTHOUGH, THE CANDIDATES ALWAYS TRY TO ANTICIPATE THE QUESTIONS\nAND COME UP WITH A BLOCKBUSTER ANSWER.\nWHILE I THINK EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IS\nGOING TO BE, MAYBE THE FIRST QUESTION.\nWE SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN CHARLOTTE, WE'VE SEEN WHAT'S\nHAPPENED NOW FOR MANY, MANY MONTHS.\nI WOULD BE SURPRISED IF THE MODERATOR LESTER DID NOT ASK A\nQUESTION EITHER AT THE TOP OR EARLY ON ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR\nSUBJECT. SO THE CANDIDATES KIND OF GOT A\nHEADS UP HERE. JENNA: THE STORY IS CHANGING\nQUICKLY. WE WILL SEE WHERE WE ARE FOUR\nDAYS FROM NOW. THERE'S A SPECIAL BURDEN YOU SAY\nON THE MODERATORS THIS YEAR, WHAT IS THAT?\n>> WELL, THE MODERATORS ARE BEING PUSHED BY MANY PEOPLE TO\nFACT-CHECK THE CANDIDATES WHICH, OF COURSE, CALLS FOR A LOT OF\nKNOWLEDGE ON THEIR PART ABOUT MANY, MANY DIFFERENT SUBJECTS.\nIT'S ALSO A DANGEROUS TERRAIN FOR THEM BECAUSE IF THEY APPEAR\nTO BE SIDING WITH ONE CANDIDATE OR THE OTHER, LET'S JUST SAY\nTHEY WILL GET THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF EMAILS AND TWEETS\nAND LETTERS AND CALLS. I WOULD RATHER THINK THEY WOULD\nLIKE TO AVOID THAT. ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE ARE\nPEOPLE WHO ADVOCATE THAT MODERATORS SHOULD MINIMIZE THEIR\n-- THEIR ROLE IN THE DEBATE. THEY SHOULD LET THE CANDIDATES\nCONDUCT THE FLOW OF THE DISCUSSION, KEEPING OBVIOUSLY\nSOME KIND OF TIME COUNT TO MAKE SURE THAT BOTH CANDIDATES HAVE A\nREASONABLE CHANCE TO MAKE THEIR CASE.\nJENNA: INTERESTING, WE WILL WATCH FOR HOW TO MODERATORS\nHANDLE IT. YOU SEE THAT CLINTON NEEDS TO\nPERSUADE YOUNGER VOTERS AND ALSO NEEDS TO PULL A FEW PERCENTAGE\nPOINTS WORTH OF ANTITRUMP REPUBLICANS.\nI'M CURIOUS ABOUT THAT SECOND SEGMENT.\nCAN CLINTON WIN IF SHE DOESN'T WIN THOSE REPUBLICANS OVER?\n>> WELL, SHE CAN. OBVIOUSLY SHE WOULD LIKE FOR\nTHERE TO BE ENOUGH OF AN EDGE THAT IT BRINGS A DEMOCRATIC\nSENATE. SHE DOES GET ELECTED PRESIDENT,\nPRESIDENCY WILL BE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT AND BOTH HOUSES OF\nCONGRESS ARE CONTROLLED BY REPUBLICANS.\nI THINK THAT'S PART OF THINKING. LOOK, THERE'S BEEN ONE SURVEY\nOUT, JENNA, SUGGESTING THAT MILLENNIALS ARE THE LEAST LIKELY\nSEGMENT OF THE ELECTORATE TO WATCH THIS DEBATE WHICH\nDISAPPOINTS ME AS A COLLEGE PROFESSOR.\nI'M TRYING TO GET ALL OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE TO WATCH.\nTHERE'S SOMETHING I'VE LEARNED OVER THE YEARS ABOUT YOUNG\nPEOPLE, THEY'RE ALWAYS BUSY, JENNA.\nJENNA: WHAT ARE THEY DOING, LARRY, THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO\nKNOW? >> I'M AFRAID TO KNOW.\n[LAUGHTER] JENNA: INTERESTING QUESTION\nABOUT DEBATES, WHETHER OR NOT -- NOT WHETHER THEY MATTER BUT\nWHETHER THEY MATTER TO THE GROUPS OR CANDIDATE THAT IS THEY\nREALLY NEED. JUST FINISHING UP, ONE OF THE\nTHINGS YOU SAID ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, WE'RE IN UNPRECEDENTED\nTERRITORY. YOU'RE NOT CLOSING THE DOOR ON\nGOOD DEBATE FOR HIM AND REALLY PUSHING HIM TO A NATIONAL LEAD?\n>> OH, SURE, HE IS THE TELEVISION PROFESSIONAL BETWEEN\nTHOSE TWO CANDIDATES. HE IS MORE RELAXED ON TV, HE'S\nUSED TO TELEVISION, HE'S MUCH MORE SPONTANEOUS THAN CLINTON\nIS. CLINTON SOMETIMES IS LAWYER IN\nCHIEF AND THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY COME ACROSS WELL IN\nA DEBATE. I THINK WHAT SHE HAS TO DO IS,\nYOU KNOW, OCCASIONALLY SHOW SOME HUMOR, SHOW SOME PERSONAL SIDE\nOF HERSELF IN HER ANSWERS. IF SHE WANTS TO CONNECT WITH\nPEOPLE INSTEAD OF MAKE DEBATING POINTS.\nJENNA: WE WILL SEE WHAT THEY END UP DOING.\nAS WE'VE NOTICED AND SEEN OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS, NEWS CAN\nCHANGE QUICKLY. WE WILL SEE WHAT WE ARE TALKING\nABOUT BY THEN. LARRY, GREAT TO SEE YOU, THANK\nYOU.",

AGAIN, THIS MONEY FROM TRUMP'S\nFOUNDATION BEING USED NOT FOR CHARITY BUT TO SETTLE LAWSUITS\nAGAINST BUSINESSES OWNED BY TRUMP.\nTHAT'S ILLEGAL. ASKED ABOUT THE STORY ON THIS\nNETWORK, MIKE PENCE CLAIMED THE WASHINGTON POST GOT IT WRONG.\n>> I THINK WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT THERE'S A NUMBER OF FACTUAL\nERRORS IN THAT STORY AS THERE WERE IN PREVIOUS STORIES ABOUT\nTHE TRUMP FOUNDATION. I'M CONFIDENTIALITY THEY'LL BE\nABLE TO ADDRESS THOSE AND NON THAT THEY FULLY SUPPLIED WITH --\nCOMPLIED WITH THE LAW. >> TO BACK UP JUST A MINUTE.\nDO YOU KNOW WHAT THE FACTUAL ERRORS WHERE?\n>> I THINK THE FOUNDATION WILL BE ABLE TO LAY THOSE OUT.\n>> THE POST REPORT IS PEPPERED WITH INACCURACIES FROM A BIASSED\nREPORTER. THEY DID NOT DETAIL WHAT WAS\nINACCURATE AND OH MIDDED AND THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN DID NOT RESPOND.\nTRUMP HIMSELF DIDN'T OFFER CLARITY WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE\nSTORY TODAY. >> CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE WHY\nYOU MAY HAVE USED CHARITABLE DONATIONS FOR PERSONAL USES?\n>> WELL, THE FOUNDATION IS REALLY THERE AND THE MONEY GIVES\nMONEY TO VETS AND IT'S BEEN DOING A GOOD JOB.\nI THINK WE CAN PUT THAT TO SLEEP BY PUTTING OUT THE LAST REPORT.\n>> AT A CAROLINA RALLY. HE EXTOLLED THE GENERAL BENEFITS\nOF USING OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY. >> WE'RE GOING TO GET THE GULF\nSTATES TO SAFE FOR SAFE STUCH. WE DO IT -- THERE'S NOTHING LIKE\nDOING THINGS WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY.\n>> JOINING ME, NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER DAVID FARENTHAL WHO HAS\nCOVERED THE TRUMP FOUNDATION AND BROKE YESTERDAY'S STORY.\nWHAT ARE THE INACCURACIES OR OMISSIONS ARE IN YOUR REPORTING\nTHAN TOPIC? >> NO.\nIN THIS CASE WE HAD SENT A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS BEFORE THAT\nSTORY RAN, SORT OF LAYING OUT ALL THE DIFFERENT SCENARIOS WE\nWERE GOING TO DESCRIBE AND THEN WE GOT NO RESPONSE AT ALL.\nAFTER THE STORY RAN YOU SAW THE STATEMENT COMING OUT 12 HOURS\nLATER. SINCE THEN NOBODY'S HEARD\nANYTHING ABOUT SPECIFIC THINGS THEY BELIEVE ARE WRONG.\n>> THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF -- IT APPEARED A BREAK IN THE CASE\nTODAY. YOU'VE GOT THIS FOUNDATION.\nTHE FOUNDATION HAS FOR A PUBLIC AND CHARITABLE PURPOSE AND LAWS\nREQUIRE THAT YOU CAN'T USE IT TO BENEFIT YOURSELF.\nIN THE DES MOINES REGISTER, THIS WAS LYNN PATTON, AN AIDE, SHE'S\nSORT OF AN ASSISTANT TO THREE OF THE TRUMP CHILDREN.\nSHE SAYS THAT BIFFLE THE MONEY SHOULD COUNT AS TRUMP'S MONEY.\nA LOT OF TIMES HE'LL GIVE A SPEECH SOMEWHERE OR RAISE MONEY.\nHE'LL ASK THE ORGANIZATION TO CUT IT TO HIS CHARITY.\nIT WOULD OTHERWISE BE IN HIS OWN ACCOUNT.\nEELGTS HIS MONEY, NO IFs, ANDs OR WAYS ABOUT IT.\nWHAT DO YOU MAKE ABOUT THAT? >> IT'S INTERESTING IN THAT IT\nDOESN'T REALLY -- A LOT OF MORE RECENT CONTRIBUTIONS HAVE BEEN\nMYSTERIOUS. VINCE McMAHON, THE WRESTLING\nMOGUL, RICHARD HEBERS DON'T WANT TO EXPLAIN.\nIT'S POSSIBLE THAT THAT IS SOME INCOME THEY OWED TO DONALD TRUMP\nAND HE SAID PUT IN IT MY FOUNDATION.\nTHOSE PEOPLE HAVEN'T COMMENTED. IF YOU LOOK BACK FURTHER IN THE\nTRUMP 23R5IGS WHERE IT SEEMS LIKE IN TRUTH SOMEBODY PAID\nMONEY TO TRUMP'S FOUNDATION INSTEAD OF TO HIM.\nONE EXAMPLE IS THE COMEDY CENTRAL ROAST IN 2011.\nTRUMP SAID HE GAVE A $400,000 APPEARANCE FEE TO CHARITY.\nSHE'S TALKING ABOUT A BROADER PATTERN.\nNOBODY ELSE HAS IDENTIFIED THAT SO FAR.\n>> HAS THERE BEEN ANY FOLLOW-UP? TO ME, THE SMOKING GUN ASIDE\nFROM THE ENTERTAINMENT VALUE OF THE PAINTINGS AND THE TIM\nTHIBAULT HELL NET IS THE TWO LEGAL SETTLEMENTS USED MONEY OUT\nOF THE TRUMP FOUNDATION. HAS THERE BEEN ANY FURTHER\nDEVELOPMENTS ON THAT? >> NO.\nKELLY ANN CONWAY HAS MADE SOME REFERENCES IN SOME INTERVIEWS TO\nMAYBE THERE BEING MORE TO ONE OF THESE STORIES.\nTHERE'S A CASE WHERE SOMEBODY SUED TRUMP'S GOLF CLUB AFTER\nBEING OFFERED A MILLION DOLLAR HOLE IN ONE PRIZE.\nTHE HOLE IN ONE'S FOUNDATION, THAT MONEY WAS PAID BY THE TRUMP\nFOUNDATION AND NOT TRUMP'S GOLF COURSE.\nKELLY ANN CON WAY SAID THAT WAS A CLERICAL ERROR ON THEIR PARTS.\n>> I JUST WANT TO ZOOM OUT HERE AND BE CLEAR.\nYOU'VE TRIED TO LOCATE PERSONAL DONATIONS FROM THE POCKET BANK\nACCOUNT OF DONALD TRUMP. YOU'VE ONLY FOUND ONE $10,000\nCHECK, IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN. HE'S GIVEN SOME MONEY TO HIS\nFOUNDATION BUT STOPPED IN 2008 AND SAID WE HAVE A BIG POT OF\nMOIRCH. HE HAS IN CLEAR INSTANCES USED\nTHE POT OF MONEY IN WAYS THAT BENEFIT HIM.\nTHAT'S THE STORY. >> THERE'S.\n>> ALL RIGHT. DAVID FARENTHAL, THANKS FOR\nBEING WITH ME. >> THANK YOU.\n>> STILL AHEAD, EVEN AFTER STAGING A BIG ROLL OUT OF\nCHILDCARE, IT'S DIFFICULT TO PIN DOWN TRUMP'S POSITION.\nWHAT WE KNOW. FIRST, TONIGHT'S THING ONE,\nTHING TWO AFTER THIS BREAK.                             TO\n      THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE,",

HILLARY CLINTON STILL VASTLY\nOUTSPENDING HIM WITH $50 MILLION IN AUGUST.\nNOW, HIS BIGGEST EXPENSE WAS $11 MILLION TO GILES PARSCALE THAT\nDOES WORK FOR TRUMP'S PRIVATE COMPANIES.\nTO DATE HIS CAMPAIGN HAS SPENT MORE THAN $8 MILLION ON HIS OWN\nBUSINESSES LIKE HIS GOLF COURSES, HIS OFFICE TOWER RENT,\nAND THAT AIRCRAFT COMPANY THAT HE OWNS.\nBUT THAT AMOUNT DROPPED DRAMATICALLY IN AUGUST.\nONLY ABOUT HALF A MILLION DOLLARS WENT TO TRUMP AND HIS\nCOMPANY. MOST OF THAT WAS GOING TO TAG\nAIR, THAT'S THE AIRCRAFT COMPANY HE OWNS.\nHE'S NOW CHATTERING PLANES FROM A NEW HAMPSHIRE COMPANY CALLED\nPRIVATE JET SERVICES.

THE CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAW NEVER\nPONDERED THE IDEA YOU COULD HAVE A CAMPAIGN BENEFIT SOMEONE'S\nCOMPANY. THE LAWS ARE PREVENTED FROM A\nCORPORATION TO BRIBE A CAMPAIGN. SO THE LAWS NEVER ENVISIONED\nTHAT SOMEONE COULD USE THEIR OWN CAMPAIGN TO BENEFIT THEIR OWN\nCOMPANIES. AND THAT'S THE ISSUE BOTH WITH\nTHIS AND THE FOUNDATION.

WE KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT WHO WE\nARE, AND WE ARE THINKING OF THE WORDS OF THE FAMILY OF THE SCOTT\nFAMILY WHEN THE WIFE AND FAMILY HAVE SAID TO PLEASE HAVE\nPEACEFUL PROTESTS, FOR PEOPLE NOT TO BE VIOLENCE, THAT\nVIOLENCE WILL NOT HELP BRING OUR COMMUNITY TOGETHER, AND WE'RE\nURGING PEOPLE TO STAY HOME AND STAY OFF THE STREETS.\nWE ARE URGING PEOPLE TO LISTEN TO THEIR COMMUNITY LEADERS, TO\nTHEIR FAITH LEADERS. THERE WAS A STATEMENT RELEASED\nTHAT SAID WE DO NOT SUPPORT VIOLENT PROTESTS.\n>> YOU SAID EARLIER THAT YOU WANTED COMMUNITY LEADERS TO BE\nABLE TO VIEW THE VIDEO OF THE SHOOTING SO EVERYONE WOULD HAVE\nTHE SAME INFORMATION. HAS THAT HAPPENED?\n>> WE INTEND TO DO THAT TOMORROW.\n>> HAVE YOU SEEN THE VIDEO YOURSELF IN.\n>> I WILL BE SEEING IT TOMORROW. >> WHEN SHE SAYS TOMORROW, SHE\nMEANS THURSDAY, JUST A FEW HOURS.\nIT'S 3:00 IN THE MORNING OR JUST AFTER 3:00 IN THE MORNING ON THE\nEAST COAST. SO WE'LL JUST HEAR MORE ON THIS\nIN A FEW HOURS FROM NOW. AND DON LEMON ALSO SPOKE WITH\nNORTH CAROLINA'S GOVERNOR ABOUT THE BODY CAM VIDEOS.\nHE WARNED THEY DON'T ALWAYS TELL THE WHOLE STORY.\n>> THE ONE THING I'VE LEARNED IN THIS BUSINESS FOR NOW 25 YEARS\nAS THE CITY COUNCILMAN, CHAIRMAN OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE,\nAS A MAYOR FOR 14 YEARS AND A GOVERNOR FOR THREE.\nONE VIEWPOINT OF A VIDEO DOESN'T ALWAYS TELL THE WHOLE STORY.\nTHE ANGLES CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE, AND NOT HEARING\nOFTEN IN THE VIDEO -- THE COMPLEXITY, THE VIDEO IS ONE\nPIECE OF EVIDENCE, AND WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL, AND THEN I\nGO BACK TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF OUR POLICE OFFICERS.\nWHICH YOU ALSO HAVE TO PROTECT. >> YEAH.\n>> AND IT'S A VERY DELICATE LINE THAT WE AS A SOCIETY ARE DEALING\nWITH WITH ALL THE NEW MEDIA THAT IS AVAILABLE.\nIN ONE RESPECT IT CAN BE USED TO A VERY GREAT, POSITIVE THING FOR\nOUR PUBLIC, IN THE OTHER WAY THE VIDEO CAN ALSO BE ABUSED.\n>> YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS VIDEO HAVE YOU, GOVERNOR?\n>> NO, SIR. >> THE NORTH CAROLINA GOVERNOR\nTHERE SPEAKING TO DON LEMON EARLIER.\nAND AS WE MENTIONED, PEOPLE ARE ANGRY OVER THE DECISION NOT TO\nRELEASE THE VIDEO OF THE SHOOTING OF KEITH SCOTT.\nIN TULSA, OKLAHOMA, AUTHORITIES ALMOST IMMEDIATELY MADE PUBLIC\nVIDEO OF AN OFFICER SHOOTING AND KILLING AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN.\nIN THAT VIDEO, TERRENCE CRUTCHER CAN BE SEEN WITH HIS HANDS ABOVE\nHIS HEAD BEFORE HE WAS SHOT IN FACT JOINING ME NOW IS A\nCRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY AND CONSTITUTIONAL ATTORNEY PAIGE\nPATE. THANK YOU FOR COMING IN AND\nTALKING WITH US. AS WE'VE BEEN SAYING, THESE NEW\nPROTESTS ON THE STREETS OF CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA,\nPEOPLE ARE ANGRY. PROTESTERS ARE ON THE STREETS\nSHOWING ENOUGH IS ENOUGH AS FAR AS IT COMES WITH THE POLICE\nSHOOTINGS OF BLACK MEN, AND WE SAW WITH KEITH LEMONT SCOTT, THE\nSITUATION IS THAT WE'RE GETTING TWO NARRATIVES HERE.\nTHE POLICE ARE INSISTING HE WAS ARMED, AND WITNESSES AND HIS\nFAMILY AND THOSE OTHERS WHO WERE PRESENT THERE ARE INSISTING HE\nWASN'T ARMED THAT INSTEAD HE ACTUALLY HAD A BOOK.\nHOW DO YOU RECONCILE THOSE DIFFERENT STORIES?\n>> I THINK THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN RECONCILE THE STORIES IS TO LOOK\nAT THE EVIDENCE. I UNDERSTAND THERE'S AT LEAST\nONE VIDEO OF WHAT HAPPENED, BUT THE POLICE WILL NOT RELEASE THAT\nTO US YET. TO ME, THAT SUGGESTS THAT THE\nVIDEO DOES NOT NECESSARILY SUPPORT THE POLICE'S VERSION OF\nWHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED. WHILE THE POLICE DO NOT HAVE TO\nRELEASE VIDEO EVIDENCE WHEN A CASE IS UNDER INVESTIGATION, IN\nMANY JURISDICTIONS, THEY'LL DO THAT, ESPECIALLY IF THEY THINK\nRELEASING THE VIDEO WILL REDUCE THE TENSIONS, ANSWER SOME OF THE\nQUESTIONS AND PERHAPS PROVE THE OFFICER WAS ASKING REASONABLY AT\nTHE TIME HE USED EXCESSIVE FORCE.\n>> THAT'S INTERESTING. THE DAY BEFORE, AND WE WERE\nCOVERING THIS IN TULSA, OKLAHOMA, WE SAW THE POLICE\nSHOOTING, ANOTHER BLACK MAN, TERRENCE CRUTCHER.\nTHERE WAS A LOT OF VIDEO. FROM THE HELICOPTER, VIDEO FROM\nTHE GROUND LEVEL, AND PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO MAKE AN ASSESSMENT\nOF WHAT HAD HAPPENED. NOW, AGAIN, DIFFERENT VERSIONS\nOF EVENTS. POLICE INSISTING THAT HE WAS\nREACHING THROUGH THE WINDOW TO GET A GUN AND SO THE OFFICER\nSHOT HIM. WE CAN SEE, AND AS HIS ATTORNEYS\nPOINTED OUT, WE CAN SEE THE WINDOW WAS CLOSED.\nIN THAT INSTANCE WHERE YOU HAVE THAT FOOTAGE, PEOPLE CAN MAKE\nTHEIR OWN CONCLUSIONS. BUT, AGAIN, HOW DO YOU RESOLVE\nTHAT SITUATION? >> IT IS SO DIFFERENT NOW THAN\nIT USED TO BE. BEFORE WE HAD VIDEO EVIDENCE OF\nWHAT HAPPENED. JUST SEVERAL YEARS AGO BEFORE\nYOU WOULD SEE ALL OF THIS ON A PATROL CAMERA OR BODY CAMERA OR\nHELICOPTER CAMERA, YOU WOULD JUST HAVE THE OFFICER'S WORD,\nFOR THE MOST PART OVER WHAT HAPPENED.\nAND THE OFFICER WOULD SAY WELL, THE PERSON HAD A FIREARM OR I\nTHOUGHT HE MAY HAVE HAD A FIREARM.\nI WAS IN FEAR FOR MY SAFETY. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE END OF\nTHE STORY. MOST PEOPLE WOULD HAVE ACCEPTED\nTHE OFFICER'S VERSION OF WHAT HAPPENED AND WOULD NOT HAVE MADE\nANY FURTHER INQUIRINQUIRIES. NOW PEOPLE CAN SEE FOR\nTHEMSELVES WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED ON THE SCENE, AND\nTHEY'RE SECOND GUESSING THE OFFICER.\nTHAT CAN BE GOOD AND BAD. AS AN OFFICER YOU HAVE TO MAKE A\nSPLIT SECOND DETERMINATION WHETHER TO USE DEADLY FORCE OR\nNOT, AND AFTER THE FACT YOU'RE GOING TO BE JUDGED ON WHETHER\nYOUR DECISION WAS REASONABLE BASED ON WHAT WAS HAPPENING.\nNOW OTHER PEOPLE CAN SEE THAT. WE CAN INVESTIGATE IT AND HOLD\nOFFICERS RESPONSIBLE WHEN THEY JUMP THE GUN OR WHEN THEY ACTED\nINAPPROPRIATELY. AND PERHAPS THROUGH THESE VIDEOS\nAND LOOKING AT THIS EVIDENCE, WE CAN IMPROVE POLICE ZIT ACCIDENT\nENCOUNTERS TO THE EXTENT THEY'RE NOT AS DEADLY AS IN THE PAST.\nRIGHT NOW THE PENDULUM IS SWINGING TO THE OPPOSITE END.\nWE'VE ATTENTIVE AND RESPONSIVE TO THE INCIDENTS, AND HOPEFULLY\nWE'LL REACH A MIDDLE GROUND WHERE OFFICERS BEHAVE\nAPPROPRIATELY AND CITIZENS REACTING BEHAVE APPROPRIATELY.\n>> ANALYSTS POINTED OUT THE DISCREPANCY.\nWHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE WAKE OF THE NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY\nBOMBINGS, AND WITH AHMAD KHAN RA RAHMMY, THEY NEEDED HIM ALIVE.\nTHEY NEEDED TO QUESTION HIM AND SEE IF HE HAD LINKS TO LARGER\nTERRORIST CELLS. PEOPLE ARE SAYING WHY NOT DO THE\nSAME THING WHEN IT COMES TO BLACK MEN GETTING SHOT AND\nKILLED BY POLICE? WHY IS THE SAME EFFORT NOT\nAPPLIED? >> I THINK IN SOME SITUATIONS\nYOU HAVE INVESTIGATORS WHO ARE BETTER TRAINED.\nYOU HAVE FEDERAL AGENTS FOCUSSED ON TERRORIST INVESTIGATIONS.\nTHEY'RE WORKING TOWARD THE SAME GOAL.\nTHEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO AND SHARE A COMMON\nOBJECTIVE INTO GETTING THE PERSON IN CUSTODY, INVESTIGATING\nWHAT HAPPENED AND FINDING OUT AS MUCH AS THEY CAN.\nON THE FLIP SAID PATROL OFFICERS MAY NOT BE THAT EXPERIENCED OR\nPROPERLY TRAINED JUST ACTING INSTINCTIVELY.\nTHAT'S NOT A GOOD THING IN LAW ENFORCEMENT.\nWHEN YOU'RE ENCOUNTERING SOMEONE IN AN INVESTIGATION, YOU HAVE TO\nRELY ON TRAINING AND NOT NECESSARILY SPLIT INSTANT SORT\nOF REACTIONS BASED ON FEAR OR INSECURITY.\nSO I THINK WE'RE MISSING OUT ON THE TRAINING FROM FORCES ACROSS\nTHE COUNTRY THAT WE HAVE IN THE FEDERAL LEVEL.\nI KNOW HILLARY CLINTON PROPOSED TODAY THE IDEA OF NATIONAL\nSTANDARDS FOR POLICE OFFICERS IN USE OF FORCE CASES.\nTHAT WOULD BE A WELCOME CHANGE. WE DON'T HAVE THAT NOW.\nWE HAVE A TON OF DIFFERENT POLICIES AROUND THE COUNTRY, AND\nWHAT MAY BE OKAY IN ONE JURISDICTION IS NOT OKAY IN\nANOTHER. >> PAGE, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR\nTALKING WITH US. APPRECIATE IT.\n>> THANK YOU, ROSEMARY. >> WE'LL TAKE A SHORT BREAK.\nSTILL TO COME THE CONTROVERSY OTHER POLICE SHOOTINGS IS A TOP\nTALKING POINT FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES.\nWHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY STILL TO COME.",

THIS FOLLOWS THE SHOOTING OF AN\nUNARMED BLACK MAN IN TULSA, OKLAHOMA.\nRACE AND POLICING AT THE CENTER OF THIS NATIONAL DISCUSSION.\nSO JOINING US NOW IS RETIRED LAPD POLICE SERGEANT AND NYPD\nPOLICE DETECTIVE. GREAT TO HAVE BOTH OF YOU WITH\nALL OF YOUR VAST EXPERIENCE. SHERYL YOU HAVE A BLACK WOMAN,\nLAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. LET'S START WITH TULSA.\nBECAUSE THAT CASE IS POSSIBLY MORE DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN.\nTHAT WAS DEFINITELY AN UNARMED MAN.\nHE WAS HAVING CAR TROUBLE WHEN POLICE PULLED UP ON HIM AND\nWITHIN THE SPACE OF JUST A FEW SHORT MINUTES, HE HAD BEEN SHOT.\nWHEN YOU WACHD THAT VIDEO OF HIM WITH HIS ARMS UP, AS HE WALKED\nBACK TO HIS CAR, WHEN WE BELIEVE THEY WERE ISSUING ORDERS FOR HIM\nTO STAY STILL, OR TO MAYBE DROP TO THE GROUND, THEY SAID HE WAS\nREACHING FOR SOMETHING IN HIS CAR.\nYOU DO SEE HIS HAND NEAR HIS DOOR BUT THE WINDOW WAS SHUT.\nWHAT DO YOU SEE HERE? >> WELL, YOU KNOW, WE'RE\nASSUMING THAT HE WAS RETURNING TO THE CAR AGAINST ORDERS.\nBUT HE COULD HAVE VERY WELL BEEN RETURNING TO THE CAR BECAUSE\nTHEY ASKED HIM TO GO GET HIS IDENTIFICATION, OR HIS\nREGISTRATION AND INSURANCE, RIGHT?\n>> RIGHT. WE DON'T KNOW.\nAND WE DON'T HEAR THE AUDIO. >> SO THAT'S -- THAT'S THE FIRST\nTHING THAT COMES TO MIND. AND THEN THE SECOND THING FOR ME\nTHAT'S VERY TROUBLING IS IF THIS OFFICER BY HER OWN ADMISSION IS\nSCARED MORE THAN SHE'S EVER BEEN IN HER LIFE, WHY ARE YOU CHASING\nHIM? WHY ARE YOU FOLLOWING HIM?\nWHY ARE YOU RUNNING UP ON HIM IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING.\nTHE BEST THING SHE COULD HAVE DONE FOR HERSELF IN THAT MOMENT\nWAS TO TAKE CONCEALMENT AND COVER, AND GIVE HIM SOME\nCOMMANDS AND WAIT FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES.\n>> BUT DOES THIS SITUATION AS YOU SEE IT, OBVIOUSLY WE WEREN'T\nTHERE. BUT WE DO HAVE A FEW DIFFERENT\nANGLES OF IT, THE AERIAL FROM THE CHOPPER RIGHT THERE THAT\nWE'RE LOOKING AT NOW, DOES THIS WARRANT BEING MORE SCARED THAN\nYOU EVER HAVE BEEN IN YOUR WHOLE LIFE AS A POLICE OFFICER?\n>> LISTEN, SCARY THINGS HAPPEN. IT'S INHERENT TO POLICE WORK,\nRIGHT? PEOPLE DON'T COOPERATE.\nPEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS COME TO US WHEN WE TELL THEM.\nPEOPLE DON'T STOP. IT'S INHERENT TO WHAT WE DO.\nAND YOU DON'T GET TO USE YOUR WEAPON AS A BULLYING TOOL AS AN\nINTIMIDATION TOOL TO COMPEL SOMEONE TO STOP.\nTO COME HERE. RIGHT?\nIF YOU'RE AFRAID, TAKE COVER AND CONCEALMENT.\nTHERE'S NO URGENCY. THERE'S NO EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCE\nTO ACT NOW. WAIT UNTIL YOU HAVE THE\nRESOURCES AND MAKE THAT SITUATION SAFE FOR YOU AND THE\nSUSPECT. >> HARRY, TULSA POLICE SAY THAT\nTHEY FOUND PCP IN THE CAR AND THE POLICE OFFICER, AT LEAST\nREPORTS WE'VE HEARD, REPORTS SHE BELIEVED THAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN\nON SOMETHING. HE HAD A VACANT STARE.\nDOES THAT CHANGE THE EQUATION FOR YOU?\n>> WELL, NO. I MEAN, THE FACT DID THE FACT IS\nHERE JUST BECAUSE HE MIGHT BE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF SOME KIND\nOF DRUG DOESN'T GIVE YOU THE REASON TO SHOOT SOMEBODY.\nYOU'VE GOT TO -- YOU'VE GOT TO FEEL THAT EITHER YOUR LIFE OR\nANOTHER OFFICER'S LIFE IS IN DANGER.\nAND WHAT SHERYL SAID BEFORE YOU KNOW I AGREE WITH HER TACTICS.\nTHOSE ARE TACTICS THAT SHE COULD HAVE DONE.\nBUT, IF YOU LOOK AT THE VIDEO, BACK UP ARRIVED PRETTY QUICKLY.\nSO BACKUP DID ARRIVE. ALL RIGHT.\nAND THE FACT IS, THAT THERE'S A LOT OF RHETORIC OUT THERE SAYING\nTHAT THIS MAN WAS SHOT WITH HIS HANDS UP.\nI STUDIED THAT VIDEO. HIS HANDS WERE NOT UP WHEN HE\nWAS SHOT. >> THIS VIDEO?\n>> EXACTLY. >> I'VE LOOKED AT IT AS WELL.\nIT LOOKS TO ME LIKE ONE HAND WAS UP, AND ONE HAND WAS DOWN.\n>> THEN AS YOU CAN SEE, WATCH WHEN HE GOES OVER TO THE DOOR,\nHIS HANDS ARE DOWN. NOW, AT THAT POINT -- I DON'T\nKNOW WHAT THE OFFICER IS TELLING HIM TO DO OR WHAT TO DO.\nALL RIGHT. BUT WHAT HAPPENS IS AT THE SAME\nEXACT TIME WHEN SHE FIRES IT APPEARS FROM INFORMATION THAT I\nHAVE READ, THAT HE ALSO FIRED THE TASER AT THE SAME TIME.\n>> A DIFFERENT OFFICER FIRED THE TASER.\n>> HE ALSO SAID IF HE HAD HIS WEAPON IN HIS HAND HE WOULD HAVE\nSHOT HIM ALSO AT THAT TIME. THAT IS A STATEMENT MADE BY ONE\nOF THE OFFICERS. NOW LOOKING AT THAT -- ALL I CAN\nSAY IS THAT THE OFFICER SHOT THEM MAYBE WE CAN'T REALLY 23E8\nIF THAT WINDOW IS UP OR DOWN. IT COULD BE THE BACK SEAT THAT\nWE'RE LOOKING AT -- >> THE FAMILY'S ATTORNEY SAYS\nTHE WINDOW WAS UP AND SHOWED A PICTURE OF BLOOD SMEAR -- HE\nBLEW IT UP AND HE LOOKED -- >> I SAW THAT.\n>> YOU CAN SEE THE WINDOW AND THERE'S A BLOOD SMEAR ON IT SO\nTHE WINDOW WAS UP WHEN HE WAS SHOT.\n>> I DIDN'T SEE THE BLOOD SMEAR ON THE WINDOW AT ALL.\nI SAW THE BLOOD SMEAR ON THE BOTTOM PART OF THE DOOR AND I\nLOOKED AT THAT PICTURE VERY CLOSE UP.\nIT LOOKS LIKE MAYBE THE WINDOW IS UP BUT MAYBE ALSO THE WINDOW\nIS DOWN. THAT LITTLE SHINE THAT YOU SEE\nIN THE WINDOW THAT YOU THINK IS A REFLECTION-\n>> THIS RAISES THE QUESTION JUST BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S NOT COMPLYING\nTHEY CAN BE SHOT? >> NO, NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M\nSAYING. WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE DONE IS MADE\nWHAT'S CALLED A FURTHERIVE MOVE. LISTEN.\nI TELL YOU KEEP YOUR HANDS OUT OF YOUR POCKET AND KEEP YOUR\nHANDS UP AND I'VE GOT A GUN ON YOU.\nALL RIGHT. YOU AND I WHAT ARE WE GOING TO\nDO? WE'RE GOING TO KEEP OUR HANDS\nUP. THIS MAN DID NOT.\nOKAY THE FACT IS THAT MAYBE NOW, WHY, AS A POLICE OFFICER YOU'RE\nTHINKING WHY IS THAT MAN NOT KEEPING HIS HANDS UP?\nRIGHT? IS HE GOING TO REACH FOR A\nWEAPON? >> GO AHEAD CHERYL.\n>> I UNDERSTAND ALL OF THAT. WHAT'S PROBLEMATIC FOR ME IS\nTHAT SHE HAD HER WEAPON OUT IN THE FIRST POLICE.\nWHO PULLS A WEAPON OUT ON A STRANDED MOTORIST FOR ANY\nREASON. AND IF YOU THINK SOMETHING, YOU\nNEED TO KNOW. IF YOU'RE GOING TO DISCHARGE A\nFIREARM. YOU NEED TO BE ABSOLUTELY SURE.\n>> WHAT ABOUT THE DRUG CONNECTION?\nWHAT ABOUT IF -- YOU KNOW I MEAN THEIR THINKING IS THAT IF HE IS\nVACANT, IF HE'S NOT FOLLOWING COMMANDS, IF HE'S ON PCP THAT\nANYTHING CAN HAPPEN. THEY, THEY KNOW THAT THERE'S\nVIOLENCE PEOPLE. PEOPLE ARE NOT EXERCISING THEIR\nBEST JUDGMENT. >> ISN'T THAT CONVENIENT NOW TO\nSAY THAT HE WAS ON PCP WHEN SHE HAD JUST RECEIVED THIS\nSTRANDING. I'VE ALSO BEEN TRAINED ON\nRECOGNIZING SOMEONE WHO IS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF PCP AND THERE'S\nSOMETHING CALLED NYSTAGMUS AND 245E9S WHEN YOUR EYEBALL DOES\nNOT HAVE SMOOTH PURSUIT. TO SAY THAT HE HAD A BLANK STARE\nAND WAS ON PCP ABSENT NYSTAGMUS BECAUSE PCP IS THE ONLY THING\nTHAT CAUSES THAT IS PROBLEMATIC FOR ME.\nAND SO I THINK THAT OFFICER SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO ARCTIC\nLIGHT EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS THAT MADE HER FEARFUL OTHER THAN I\nTHOUGHT SOMETHING THAT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN OCCURRING.\nBECAUSE WHAT WE UNDERSTAND IS THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO\nARGUE WITH AN OFFICER, WHAT IS IN THEIR HEAD.\n>> PEOPLE -- >> THE PERCEPTION OF DANGER IS\nDIFFERENT IN EACH OFFICER. BECAUSE, IN EACH SITUATION IS\nDIFFERENT. YOU CAN'T COMPARE THIS INCIDENT\nTO ANOTHER INCIDENT. EACH ONE ITSELF IS DIFFERENT IN\nITS OWN WAY. AND THAT OFFICER PERCEIVED A\nDANGER. I'M TELLING YOU TO SAY AWAY FROM\nTHE CAR. I'M TELLING YOU KEEP YOUR HANDS\nOUT OF YOUR POCKET AND YOU KEEP ON GOING FOR IT.\nWHY? >> HARRY HOUCK, CHERYL DORSEY\nTHANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR EXPERTISE.\n>> ALL RIGHT, PRESIDENT OBAMA AS YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE.\nI THINK. HOW DID THE PRESIDENT AND\nANTHONY BOURDAIN WIND UP TOGETHER IN VIETNAM?\nTONY BOURDAIN IS HERE WITH THE DELICIOUS STORY.\nNEXT. DON'T FALL ASLEEP.",

THERE IS AN INVESTIGATION ON\nTHAT. NOW WE'RE REJOINING DAVID BRUNO.\nYOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW HOMICIDE INVESTIGATION TAKES\nTIME. >> WE'RE IN LIGHTNING SPEED NOW.\nTHE GOVERNOR TELLING AND TALKING ABOUT THE 24 HOUR NEWS MEDIA AS\nWELL AS SOCIAL MEDIA. PEOPLE ARE SIDING WITH WHAT THEY\nSEE ON SOCIAL MEDIA. HOW DO AUTHORITIES DEAL WITH\nTHAT? >> IT'S A BATTLE AND GOING TO BE\nA BATTLE MOVING FORWARD. BUT WHEN ARE WE GOING TO LEARN?\nWE HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE. BALTIMORE IS AN EXAMPLE.\nFERGUSON IS AN EXAMPLE. WHEN I HEARD THERE WAS A GUN\nENSOLVED TODAY I HAD TO THINK ABOUT DWYANE JOHNSON AND HIS\nFIRST ACCOUNT OF THE MICHAEL BROWN INCIDENT.\nHE SAID MICHAEL BROWN HAD HIS HANDS UP.\nTHAT WAS A NARRATIVE THAT WAS ADOPTED IN FACT IT WAS A\nMOVEMENT. HANDS UP, DON'T SHOOT.\nIN REALITY, THE EVIDENCE SHOWED THAT THAT WASN'T TRUE AND\nMICHAEL BROWN WAS CHARGING DARREN WILSON.\nWHEN PEOPLE FIRST FOUND OUT AN INDIVIDUAL WAS SHOT AS A\nPROTESTOR, I'M SURE PEOPLES' FIRST IMPRESSION AND THOUGHT IS\nTHAT IT WAS ANOTHER POLICE SHOOTING.\nAND IT COULD HAVE AGITATED PROTESTORS AND THE CROWD.\nTHAT WAS NOT TRUE. IT WAS ANOTHER, IT WAS A\nPROTESTOR ON PROTESTOR. CIVILIAN ON CIVILIAN.\nNOT A POLICE SHOOTING. IT WAS GOING TO BE A BATTLE.\nAND THE GRAND JURY INVESTIGATION INTO THE MICHAEL BROWN CASE SAID\nTHAT NEVER HAPPENED. IT IS OUT THERE AND BELIEVED IT\nCAN, AS A NATION CAN THERE WITH A COOLING OFF?\nAND HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THIS IN TERMS OF A COUNTRY?\nBETWEEN THOSE WHO ARE ONE ON SIDE OF DEALING WITH THIS AS\nWELL AS POLICE? >> I HOPE WE CAN GET PAST THIS.\nBUT TO BE HONEST, I THINK THAT THE MOVEMENT, THE BLK LIVES\nMATTER, THE PROTESTORS NEED TO BE GETTING BEHIND THE RIGHT\nCASES. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS I SEE IS\nTHAT THEY'RE GETTING BEHIND THE LOSERS.\nTHE ZIMMERMAN CASE, THE BALTIMORE CASE.\nIT MAY BE THIS CASE AS WELL. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE PROTEST\nAS A RESULT OF A LAWFUL POLICE SHOOTING.\nSOMEBODY DID NOT COMMIT A CRIME. SO THAT IS PHASE ONE, I BELIEVE.\nIT'S GETTING BEHIND THE RIGHT CASES BECAUSE THERE ARE BAD\nPOLICE OFFICERS OUT THERE. IT IS NOT A MAJORITY.\nTHAT THEY SHOULD BE PROSECUTED AND GIVING BACK TO MY POINT,\nTHAT TAKES TIME. SOME UNFORTUNATELY, I KNOW YOU\nDIDN'T MEAN IT IN THIS MANNER. AND THAT IS WHAT I MEANT.\nTHEY'RE GETTING BEHIND THIS NARRATIVE AND SO THE EVIDENCE\nSHOWS IT WAS INACCURATE. AND THERE IS SYSTEMIC HISTORY\nHERE OF RACISM. THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.\nOKAY? BUT THERE ARE CASES WHERE\nPEOPLE, POLICE OFFICERS, USE LAWFUL FORCE AND FOR THOSE\nCASES, WHEN THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THEY'RE USING FORCE\nLAWFULLY, THAT IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN SOME OF THE EARLIER\nIMPRESSIONS AND AND IN THIS SENSE, IT DOES THE MATTER, MANY\nSEE THE ENEMY IS BLUE. >> RIGHT.\nTHAT IS, I THINK THE ISSUE. IT'S BLACK AND WHITE, AND ALSO,\nBLUE. THIS INDIVIDUAL IS A POLICE\nOFFICER. SO THERE IS STILL GOING TO BE\nCRITICISM OF THE ACTIONS OF A POLICE OFFICER.\nNOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT HE'S AFRICAN AMERICAN.\nAND THIS IS THE REACTION THAT I THINK UNFORTUNATELY WE CAN\nEXPECT MOVING FORWARD. WHEN WE HEAR OF SHOOTINGS LIKE\nTHIS, THE FIRST QUESTION IS GOING TO BE WAS THE POLICE\nOFFICER BLACK OR WHITE? IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT WAY.\n>> THE BEGINNING TO CLEAN UP AS YOU CAN SIGH HERE, THANKFULLY.\nWE'RE CONTINUING THIS EVENING.

THEY DID LAST NIGHT FOR THE\nSECOND NIGHT OF VIOLENCE AND CHAOS.\n>> I SERVE A PURPOSE. I'M HERE, GUESS WHAT, WHETHER\nI'M IN SCHOOL, I'M IN CAR, YOU SAID, OKAY, A MAN GOT SHOT OVER\nHERE RIGHT, SO YOU BASICALLY SAID WHY WOULD I PUT MYSELF IN\nDANGER? >> EXACTLY.\n>> I COULD BE AT WORK, AT SCHOOL, IN MY CAR, I CAN STILL\nGET SHOT BY THE POLICE. I CAN GET SHOT ANYWHERE.\n>> THE RIOTERS AND PROTESTERS PROTESTING TWO RECENT\nPOLICE-INVOLVED SHOOTINGS ONE IN CHARLOTTE AND IN TULSA A COUPLE\nOF DAYS AGO. HERE TO REACT IS FORMER D.C.\nHOMICIDE DETECTIVE AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR ROD WHEELER.\nGOOD MORNING. >> GOOD MORNING, STEVE.\n>> WE'RE LOOKING AT WHAT HAPPENED IN TULSA AND CHARLOTTE.\nLET'S START WITH THE CHARLOTTE STORY.\nHERE'S A STORY. THE COPS WENT INTO A\nNEIGHBORHOOD. THEY WERE LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY\nELSE. THEY SAW THIS GUY GET OUT OF A\nCAR. HE HAD A GUN.\nHE GOT BACK IN THE CAR. GOT OUT OF THE CAR.\nTOLD HIM TO PUT IT DOWN. HE WAS SHOT.\n>> THAT'S RIGHT. AND THERE'S VIDEO, ACCORDING TO\nTHE POLICE CHIEF IN CHARLOTTE, TO SUBSTANTIATE THE POLICE\nOFFICER'S ACTIONS. NOT ONLY DO THEY HAVE VIDEO,\nSTEVE, BUT THEY ALSO HAVE INDEPENDENT EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS,\nSO RIGHT NOW IT SOUNDS AS THOUGH THIS IS WHAT WE CALL A GOOD\nPOLICE SHOOTING, MEANING IT WAS AN APPROPRIATE POLICE SHOOTING.\nTHE ONLY CONCERN I HAVE A LITTLE BIT IS THE FACT THAT THIS\nOFFICER THAT DID THE SHOOTING HERE, HE'S ONLY BEEN OUT OF THE\nACADEMY LESS THAN A YEAR. HE HAS TWO YEARS TOTAL ON THE\nJOB AND THEIR ACADEMY THERE IN CHARLOTTE IS ONLY SIX TO EIGHT\nMONTHS. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE AMOUNT\nOF TIME THAT AN OFFICER HAS ON THE JOB WHEN HE HAS A SHOOTING\nLIKE THAT. OVERRULE, IT -- OVERALL, IT\nLOOKS LIKE A DP SHOOTING. THE POLICE CHIEF HAS\nCOMMUNICATED WITH THE COMMUNITY IN CHARLOTTE.\nTHAT IS A GOOD THING. YOU HAVE TO CONTINUE TO\nCOMMUNICATE AND THE OTHER TWO THINGS YOU HAVE TO DO, IS YOU\nHAVE TO HAVE A VERY TRANSPARENT INVESTIGATION AND THEN THE\nINVESTIGATION NEEDS TO BE SWIFT. >> ON THE OTHER SIDE, TULSA, THE\nDETAILS SEEM TO BE A BIT MURKY EVEN THOUGH THERE IS VIDEO\nEVIDENCE. YOU'VE GOT A STALLED VEHICLE IN\nTHE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC. POLICE PULLS UP, WANTS TO GET A\nSENSE OF WHAT'S GOING ON AT WHAT POINT YOU SEE A FEMALE OFFICER\nDRAWS HER WEAPON, AN INDIVIDUAL HAS GOT HIS HANDS UP, IS\nAPPROACHING HIS VEHICLE. >> SHE FELT HE WAS ACTING ODDLY.\n>> HE CONTINUED TO WALK. >> THERE'S CONTROVERSY ABOUT\nWHETHER HE PUT HIS ARM DOWN OR NOT.\nYOU SEE THAT CASE DIFFERENTLY. >> RIGHT.\nYOU KNOW, I DO SEE THAT CASE DIFFERENTLY.\nREAL QUICKLY, PETE, NOW, HERE YOU HAVE A UNIFORMED OFFICER,\nFIVE YEARS ON THE JOB. THE PROBLEM HERE IS I THINK THIS\nWOMAN HAS VERY LITTLE EXPERIENCE IN DEALING WITH AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nMALES AND ESPECIALLY AFRICAN-AMERICAN MALES OF HEAVY\nSTATURE. IT JUST APPEARED TO ME AS THOUGH\nSHE EVEN SAID HERSELF SHE WAS SCARED TO DEATH OF THIS MAN.\nTHE MAN NEVER EVEN CAME AT HER, SO I DO LOOK AT THIS SHOOTING A\nLOT DIFFERENTLY. I THINK SHE'S GOING TO NEED TO\nBE RETRAINED IF SHE EVER GO -- GOES BACK TO THE POLICE FORCE.\n>> SHE SHAWTH HE WAS PUTTING HIS HANDS IN THE SUV.\n>> AND I CAN'T SEE THAT IN THE VIDEO BECAUSE THE HELICOPTER\nVIDEO DOESN'T SHOW THAT SIDE OF CAR.\n>> I HAVE TO ASK, NONCOMPLIANCE, HOW SIGNIFICANT IS NONCOMPLIANCE\nIN BOTH OF THESE ISSUES. IF AN OFFICER IS SAYING STOP OR\nDON'T DO THAT? THAT'S A PRETTY BIG WARNING\nSIGN, ISN'T IT? >> WELL, IT IS.\nWHEN AN OFFICER TELLS A PERSON TO STOP AND PUT THEIR HANDS UP,\nWE EXPECT PEOPLE TO COMPLY. LET ME JUST SAY THIS, PETE, MANY\nYEARS ON THE STREET AS A COP MYSELF, I WAS IN SITUATIONS DAY\nIN AND KAY OUT WHERE PEOPLE DID NOT COMPLY WITH OUR ORDERS.\nYOU DON'T SHOOTING THOSE FOLKS. THERE'S OTHER WAYS THAT WE ARE\nTRAINED TO TAKE A PERSON DOWN, SIGH LOT OF THIS MAY EVEN COME\nBACK TO PROPER TRAINING AND MORE TRAINING FOR POLICE OFFICERS.\n>> WHEN I SAW THIS VIDEO THAT WE'RE ABOUT TO SHOW THE\nAUDIENCE, IF YOU ARE JUST WAKING UP, YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET, I\nWAS APPALLED AT WHAT THIS GUY SAID.\nTHIS IS ALLEGEDLY THE BROTHER. HE CLAIMS TO BE THE BROTHER OF\nKEITH LAMONT SCOTT. LISTEN TO WHAT HIS BROTHER SAID.\nWE WANT TO GET YOUR REACTION. >> JUST NOTE THAT ALL WHITE\nPEOPLE ARE [ B >> MAKE SURE YOU AIR THAT ONE.\n>> AIR THAT [ BLEEP ]. ALL WHITE COPS ARE [ BLEEP ]\nDEVILS AND WHITE PEOPLE. WHAT'S YOUR REACTION?\n>> I THINK THAT YOUNG MAN WAS SPEAKING FOR A NUMBER OF\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN MALES. VERY FRUSTRATED.\nLOOK, RACISM IS ALIVE AND WELL IN THE UNITED STATES.\nWE KNOW THAT. THAT'S WHY IT'S GOING TO TAKE\nALL OF US WORKING TOGETHER TO TRY TO ERADICATE IT.\nEVEN MORE THAN RACISM, OUR COUNTRY IS SUFFERING FROM HUGE\nECONOMIC DOWN FALLS. WE DON'T HAVE ANY JOBS IN THESE\nCOMMUNITIES. THE SCHOOL SYSTEMS ARE HORRIBLE\nAND THAT'S WHY IT'S GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT AND I WANT THE\nLISTENERS TO GET THIS, THIS NEXT ELECTION, WE SELECT SOMEONE TO\nBE PRESIDENT THAT'S GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE WHEN IT COMES\nTO OUR ECONOMY AND PROVIDING JOBS IN OUR COMMUNITY.\n>> ONE PLACE IT NEEDS MORE JOB AND MORE SECURITY IS WHERE YOU\nARE SITTING RIGHT NOW IS IN CHICAGO.\nTHANK YOU FOR JOIN US ON THIS THURSDAY.",

SHE HAS NO EXPERIENCE IN LAW\nENFORCEMENT EXCEPT FOR BEING INTERVIEWED BY THEM.\nSHE HAS NO BACKGROUND OR EXPERIENCE ON HOW TO DEAL WITH\nTHESE ISSUES AND IT IS JUST A DISGRACE.\nAS SOMEONE WHO SPENT SEVEN YEARS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT, SHE'S\nEXACTLY THE KIND OF POLITICIAN THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT LOATHES,\nLOATHES HER. BECAUSE, SHE JUMPS TO\nCONCLUSIONS FOR POLITICAL GAIN AND DOESN'T CARE WHAT CAREERS OR\nLIVES SHE RUINS IN THE PROCESS. >> WELL, STEPHANIE, THE QUESTION\nI HAVE TO ASK AND MICHAEL TO YOU, WHAT IS SECRETARY CLINTON\nTALKING ABOUT WHEN SHE TALKS ABOUT IMPLICIT BIAS AND WHAT\nWOULD THAT MEAN? POLICE OFFICERS ARE IMPLICITLY\nBIASED? IS THAT THE ARGUMENT SHE'S\nMAKING NOW? >> WELL, CHRIS, I THINK WHAT\nYOU'RE HEARING FROM SECRETARY CLINTON IS WHAT YOU'RE HEARING\nFROM AMERICANS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, WHICH IS THERE'S REALLY\nSOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO BE ADDRESSING HERE.\nHILLARY HAS SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH THE MOTHERS OF THE\nMOVEMENT. AND HAS HEARD SO MANY OF THEIR\nSTORIES HAS TRAVELED WITH THEM. THERE IS A RECOGNITION THAT\nCONVERSATION AND CHANGES NEED TO BE MADE.\nAND SHE REALLY WANTS TO GET TO THE HEART OF ALL OF THIS.\n>> WHAT IS THE IMPLICIT BIAS? POLICE OFFICERS, MEN AND WOMEN\nIN BLUE, OR IS IT WHITE PEOPLE? I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT EXACTLY\nWHAT SHE WAS TARGETING THERE. >> WELL, I CAN'T SPEAK EXACTLY\nTO WHAT SHE WAS TARGETING THERE EITHER.\nTHEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SPECIFICALLY.\nI THINK WHAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT IS STEPPING BACK AND HEARING THE\nENTIRE PIECE, WHICH IS SO MANY OF OUR POLICE OFFICERS DO\nFABULOUS, FABULOUS WORK EVERY DAY.\nIT IS SUCH A HARD JOB. THAT BEING SAID, WE ARE\nCONTINUING TO SEE THING THAT IS WE SHOULD NOT BE SEEING IN THIS\nCOUNTRY. AND WE REALLY NEED TO GET TO THE\nBOTTOM OF THIS. WE HAVE LOST TOO MANY MEN AND\nWOMEN AT THE HANDS OF POLICE OFFICERS.\nAND WE REALLY NEED TO GET ON TOP OF THIS.\nIT'S TIME. IT'S WAY BEYOND TIME.\nIT IS DECADES BEYOND TIME. >> MICHAEL, YOUR THOUGHTS ON\nWHAT HILLARY CLINTON SAID AND CHRIS CHRISTIE SAID BACK AND\nFORTH. IT'S THE POLITICAL SEASON.\nWE KNOW DONALD TRUMP IS TRYING TO WIN THE SUPPORT FROM THE\nWHITE SUBURBS. WE KNOW HILLARY CLINTON WOULD\nLIKE TO ENERGIZE THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY.\nI HAVE NO OBJECTION WITH WHAT SHE'S SAYING, BUT I KNOW THE\nPOLITICAL REALITIES HERE AT WORK AND WHAT THEY ARE THINKING IN\nTERMS OF RIGHT AND WRONG. IT'S ALL MIXED IN TOGETHER.\nYOUR THOUGHTS. >> IT IS.\nCHRIS, I THOUGHT THEY WERE TALKING PAST EACH OTHER.\nI THINK HILLARY CLINTON WAS TALKING ABOUT RACE ALTHOUGH SHE\nDIDN'T WANT TO SAY THAT TERM OR PUT IT IN RACIAL CONTEXT WITH\nRELATIVE TO THE POLICE. AND I THINK THAT CHRIS CHRISTIE\nWAS TALKING ABOUT THE POLICE, INTERPRETING WHAT SHE SAID WAS\nSOMEHOW SPEAKING AGAINST THE POLICE.\nAND THAT IS THE VERY NATURE OF OUR PROBLEM.\nTHIS IS VERY MUCH ABOUT RACE. IT IS VERY MUCH ABOUT POLICING.\nIT IS VERY MUCH ABOUT CULTURE. IT IS VERY MUCH ABOUT\nCOMMUNICATION. IF YOU STEP BACK AND LISTEN TO\nTHE VIDEO OF THE COPTER POLICE OFFICER IN THE HELICOPTER, HOW\nHE DESCRIBES THE GENTLEMAN AS HE APPROACHES HIS CAR, IT'S NOT A\nPERSON, IT'S A THING. YOU KNOW, THERE IS THIS GROWING\nATTITUDE OR VIEW WITHIN THE BLACK COMMUNITY THAT WE'RE NO\nLONGER PERCEIVED AS HUMAN BEINGS.\nTHAT WHEN A COP COMESES UP TO US AND APPROACHES US, THAT THEY ARE\nREACTIONARY BECAUSE THEY DON'T SEE US AS SOMEONE\nNONTHREATENING. THEY SEE US AUTOMATICALLY AS A\nTHREAT. THAT IS NOT A PERCEPTION FOR\nBLACK PEOPLE, THAT'S A REALITY. AND HERE WE ARE TODAY --\n>> TRUMP DESCRIBED THE SITUATION IN TULSA SAYING THE PERSON HAD\nTHEIR HANDS UP IN THE AIR, THAT WAS DEALING WITH THE POLICE\nOFFICER, THAT THE POLICE OFFICER DIRECTED HIM TO DO AND HE STILL\nWINDS UP DEAD. >> SO YOU DO WHAT THEY TELL YOU\nTO DO WITH YOUR HANDS UP AND GET SHOT.\nYOU'RE HANDCUFFED YOU GET SHOT. YOU'RE DOWN ON THE GROUND AND\nTHEY ARE STANDING ON YOUR NECK, YOU GET SHOT.\nOR ARMED. YOU'RE IN THE BACK OF A POLICE\nWAGON, YOU WIND UP DEAD. SO YOU TELL ME WHAT ENVIRONMENT\nIS SAFE FOR AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN MALE WHEN IT COMES IN TO CONTEXT\nWITH THE POLICE? BECAUSE I CAN NO LONGER -- I\nDON'T EVEN KNOW IF TELLING MY KIDS, DO THE 10-2, TURN THE\nLIGHTS ON IN THE CAR, ROLL DOWN THE WINDOWS, DO EVERYTHING THE\nOFFICER SAYS IS GOING TO COME OUT ON A GOOD END OR NEGATIVE\nEND. THAT IS THE FRUSTRATION THAT YOU\nHEAR AND ARE SEEING NOW EXPRESSED MORE AND MORE OPENLY\nBY BLACK FOLKS. YOU TELL ME WHAT WE NEED TO DO\nAND WE'LL DO THAT. >> STEPHANIE, I'M IMPRESSED WITH\nWHAT MICHAEL SAID. WEREN'T YOU IMPRESSED BY WHAT\nDONALD TRUMP SAID TODAY USING THE SUSPECT, THE POLICE TERM,\nTHAT GUY HAD HIS HANDS IN THE AIR AND WAS DOING WHAT HE WAS\nTOLD BY THE POLICE OFFICER AND WAS STILL SHOT AND KILLED.\nWAS HE RIGHT IN SAYING THAT? >> WELL, I THINK WE HAVE SEEN --\n>> IS TRUMP RIGHT IN SEEING THAT?\n>> WITH REGARD TO THE VIDEO, IT DEFINITELY LOOKED LIKE SOMETHING\nWENT VERY AWRY. IT SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED.\nIT SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED. >> WAS TRUMP RIGHT IN SAYING\nTHAT? >> I MEAN, YES.\nI THINK SO. BUT FOR ALL OF US, WE ARE SEEING\nSO MANY VIDEOS. AND AFTER LISTENING TO THE\nPASTOR JUST EARLIER THAT YOU INTERVIEWED TALKING ABOUT\nGROWING UP IN THE 1970s AND WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW AND THE\nFACT THAT ALL OF -- ME, THIS KID WHO GREW UP IN A VERY SAFE\nMIDDLE CLASS FAMILY IN MONTANA, NOW IS SEEING THINGS THAT I\nNEVER SAW. AND IT IS HORRIFYING.\nIT IS HORRIFYING. AND AS I HAVE SEEN HILLARY TALK\nABOUT IT AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICANS ARE SAYING ENOUGH.\nWE HAVE TO COME UP WITH SOME SOLUTIONS HERE.\nAND THIS IS REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT.\nAND I CERTAINLY HOPE WE CAN GET THERE.\n>> ONE LAST WORD, QUICKLY, MICHAEL.\n>> I THINK WE NEED TO STEP THIS AWAY A LITTLE BIT FROM THE\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES AND THE HIGH LEVEL.\n>> IT'S HARD. >> IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT\nMAYORS, GOVERNORS, CITY COUNCILMEN AND WOMEN AND LOCAL\nPOLICE AND COMMUNITY LEADERS HAVE TO DEAL WITH, ARE YOU JUST\nGOING TO GET THE PLATITUDES AND THE WARM WORDS AND THE CONCERN\nAT THE FEDERAL LEVEL? WE NEED TO GET OUR HANDS DIRTY\nON THIS ISSUE. AND THAT ONLY HAPPENS WHEN\nYOU'RE ON THE GROUND IN THOSE COMMUNITIES.\nTHAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE. >> MAYBE WE SHOULD URGE OUR KIDS\nTO BECOME POLICE OFFICERS. MAYBE WE NEED BETTER COPS.\nI'M TELLING YOU, IT'S A SCARY JOB IN SOME CASES AND I LIKE THE\nWAY TRUMP HANDLED IT TONIGHT. YOU DO EVERYTHING RIGHT AND YOU\nSTILL GET KILLED, SOMETHING IS WRONG.\nTHANK YOU FOR COMING ON.",

ONE CIVILIAN SHOT ANOTHER\nCIVILIAN AND THAT CIVILIAN IS ON LIFE SUPPORT.\n>> THIS ALL STARTED BECAUSE OF A POLICE SHOOTING AND THERE ARE\nVERY DIFFERENT STORIES EMERGING OF HOW KEITH LAMONT SCOTT DIED.\nHIS FAMILY SAID HE WAS UNARMED READING A BOOK IN HIS CAR.\nTHE POLICE CHIEF SAID SCOTT GOT OUT OF THE SCAR WITH A GUN AND\nINVESTIGATORS FOUND NO BOOK AT ALL.\nTHIS MORNING, DEMANDS ARE GROWING FOR THE RELEASE OF\nPOLICE VIDEO OF THE SHOOTING. THE GOVERNOR WHO HAS NOT SEEN\nTHE VIDEO SAYS HE HAS CONCERNS ABOUT THAT.\nONE VIEWPOINT OF A VIDEO DOESN'T EVEN TELL THE WHOLE STORY.\nTHE ANGLES CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE.\nNOT HEARING OFTEN IF THE VIDEO SAYS THE COMPLEXITY -- THE VIDEO\nWE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WITH ALL OF THE NEW MEDIA THAT IS\nAVAILABLE. IN ONE RESPECT, IT CAN BE USED\nTO A VERY GREAT POSITIVE THING FOR OUR PUBLIC AND IN ANOTHER\nWAY, THE VIDEO CAN BE ABUSED. >> REPORTING FROM THE GROUND NOW\nIN CHARLOTTE IS OUR NICK VALENCIA.\nNICK, ANYMORE PROTESTS AT THIS HOUR?\n>> Reporter: NO, WE DON'T SEE ANYMORE DEMONSTRATORS OR\nPROTESTERS. THAT HAS BEEN A COUPLE OF HOURS\nSINCE THINGS DISBURSED ON THE STREETS OF CHARLOTTE.\nTHERE ARE SOME RESIDENTS TO SEE THE AFTERMATH AND SEE WHAT\nHAPPENED TO THE STREETS OF DOWNTOWN CHARLOTTE WHICH WAS\nTORN FROM WITHIN BY RIOTERS. THE PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATIONS\nSTARTED AT 6:00, BUT ESCALATED INTO SOMETHING WORSE.\nAGITATORS LED TO POLICE WITH TEAR GAS.\nSOME SAID IT WASN'T UNTIL THE TEAR GAS THAT THINGS GOT\nVIOLENT. YOU SEE BEHIND ME, A SOUVENIR\nSTORE, THE AFTERMATH OF RIOTERS. WE SAW INVESTIGATORS HERE\nSTARTING TO TAKE PICTURES AND A SHORT TIME AGO BEFORE WE STARTED\nOUR BROADCAST HERE. A LOT OF BUSINESSES ARE MORE OF\nTHE SAME. THIS STRING OF BUSINESSES THAT\nARE LINING THE THOROUGHFARE IN CHARLOTTE WITH GRAFFITI AND\nSMASHED WINDOWS. YOU CAN SEE \"BLM\" SPRAY PAINTED\nON AN ATM. THERE ARE SIMILAR -- EXCUSE ME.\nSPRAY PAINTED THROUGHOUT CHARLOTTE.\nWE HEARD FROM A NATIONAL CONGRESS MEMBER IN THE STATE OF\nNORTH CAROLINA WHO ASKED WHERE THE NATIONAL LEADERSHIP WAS\nWITHIN THE BLACK LIVES MATTER MOVEMENT.\n>> WHAT WE SEE NOW IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE.\nWHERE IS MARTIN LUTHER KING TODAY?\nWHERE IS THE SPIRIT OF MARTIN LUTHER KING?\nWE CHERISH HIM AND HIS MEMORY EVERY FEBRUARY AND HONOR HIM.\nWHERE IS THE SPIRIT OF THAT? WHERE IS THE LEADERSHIP?\nTHIS IS NONSENSE. WE NEED FOR TRUTH TO PREVAIL AND\nTRUTH TO COME OUT. WE NEED PEOPLE TO WALK IN\nINTEGRITY AND FOR THOSE WHO HAVE COME IN NOW TO AGITATE AND TRY\nTO BRING DISORDER AND MORE OF THE VIOLENCE AND RAISE THE LEVEL\nOF CONCERN. WHERE IS THE MEASURED VOICES OF\nTHE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES?\nWHERE IS THE MEASURED VOICE OF THE HEAD OF THE JUSTICE\nDEPARTMENT OR ATTORNEY GENERAL? THESE ARE LEADERS FOR THE\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY. WHERE IS THE THOUGHTFUL RESPONSE\nTO BRING CALM AND BRING AS ASSU\nASSURANCE? >> Reporter: THINGS WERE\nANYTHING BY CALM LAST NIGHT. WHAT IS THE ISSUE HERE IS THE\nTHREADS OF INFORMATION RELEASED BY THE FAMILY AND POLICE.\nKEITH SCOTT'S FAMILY SAID HE WAS UNARMED AND WAITING FOR HIS SON\nTO GET OFF THE SCHOOL BUS WITH A BOOK.\nPOLICE DID FIND A GUN ON HIM AND OFFICERS FEARED FOR THEIR LIVES\nWHICH IS WHY THEY HAD TO OPEN FIRE.\nTHE FRUSTRATION FUELED BY THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY.\nTHEY WANT TO SEE BODY CAM FOOTAGE AND DASH CAM FOOTAGE.\nBECAUSE THAT IS PART OF THE INVESTIGATION, IT WON'T BE\nRELEASED ANYTIME SOON. JOHN, CHRISTINE.\n>> NICK, YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THE AUTHORITIES ARE TRYING TO FIGURE\nOUT WHAT TO GET OUT QUICKLY. WE HAVE SEEN IN CASES BEFORE, IF\nYOU ALLOW THE TWO COMPETING STORY LINES TO FLOURISH, PEOPLE\nMAY NOT BELIEVE THAT VIDEO OR NOT BELIEVE THE OUTCOME OF THE\nINVESTIGATION IF IT TAKES TOO LONG.\n>> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT. IT SEEMS THERE IS AN INTENSE\nAMOUNT OF PUBLIC DISTRUST OF POLICE OFFICERS HERE IN\nCHARLOTTE AMONG THE COMMUNITY. A LOT OF THE CONFRONTATION BY\nDEMONSTRATORS BY POLICE IS FUELED BY THE FACEBOOK LIVE\nSTREAM VIDEO BY KEITH SCOTT'S DAUGHTER AFTER SCOTT WAS SHOT TO\nDEATH BY POLICE. IN IT, SHE DISCOVERED HER FATHER\nWAS SHOT AND KILLED. IT IS RAW AND EMOTIONAL.\nBY NOW IT HAS BEEN VIEWED HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF TIMES\nAS THE VIDEO WAS VIEWED MORE AND MORE, PEOPLE SPILLED INTO THE\nSTREETS. POLICE BRACING FOR POSSIBLY MORE\nPROTESTS TONIGHT. THEY ARE PREPARED AND THE\nNATIONAL GUARD HAS BEEN CALLED IN TO HELP.\nCHRISTINE. >> NICK VALENCIA ON THE GROUND\nFOR NEWS CHARLOTTE. BEFORE THE NIGHT OF VIOLENCE,\nTHE WIFE OF KEITH SCOTTI ISSUEDA STATEMENT.\nAS A FAMILY, WE RESPECT THE RIGHTS OF THOSE WHO WISH TO\nPROTEST, BUT WE ASK YOU PROTEST PEA\nPEACEFULLY. DO NOT DAMAGE PROPERTY OR TAKE\nTHINGS IN THE NAME OF PROTESTING.\n>> WE SPOKE EARLIER WITH MARCUS DIPAOLA.\nHE DESCRIBED HOW THINGS UNFOLD THE IN DOWNTOWN CHARLOTTE.\n>> AFTER 8:00 TO MIDNIGHT, I REALLY DID NOT HAVE A CHANCE TO\nTAKE OFF BY GAS MASK FOR MORE THAN A COUPLE SECONDS AT A TIME.\nPROTESTERS WERE SMASHING GLASS EVERYWHERE.\nI REMEMBER WHAT I NOW ASSUME WAS THE RESTAURANT MANAGER OR OWNER\nSCREAMING AT PROTESTERS FOR WRECKING WINDOWS.\nONE OF THE MOST STRIKING VISUALS THAT I REMEMBER AND I HAVE NOT\nLEFT YET BECAUSE I FINISHED COMPILING THE FOOTAGE.\nPROTESTERS GOT ON THE HIGHWAY. POLICE GOT IN A SINGLE FILE LINE\nAND SHOT PEPPER BALLS AT THEM TO GET OFF THE HIGHWAY.\nTHIS WAS A REALLY BAD NIGHT FOR THE CITY.\nI WAS PUSHED TO THE GROUND TWICE AND SO WERE MY CREW.\n>> MARCUS, YOU WERE OUT THERE OVERNIGHT.\nDO YOU HAVE ANY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT TONIGHT, THURSDAY\nNIGHT, WON'T BE LIKE THIS AGAIN? >> YEAH.\nI DID NOT SEE HUGE AMOUNT OF ORGANIZATION ON EITHER THE PART\nOF THE POLICE OR PROTESTERS. IT LOOKED LIKE POLICE LOST\nCONTROL OF THE SITUATION. I THINK NOW THAT BOTH POLICE AND\nPROTESTERS WILL HAVE A GOOD SIX-TO-EIGHT HOURS OF DAYLIGHT,\nEVERYBODY WILL HAVE TIME TO ORGANIZE.\nI'M REALLY NERVOUS ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN TONIGHT EVENING\nTHURSDAY NIGHT BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL HAVE TIME TO ORGANIZE.\n>> THANKS TO MARCUS DIPAOLA FOR",

IT STARTED PEACEFULLY AT 6:00\nLAST NIGHT AND IT TURNED UGLY QUICKLY.\nIT DEPENDS ON WHO YOU ASK AS FAR AS WHO IS TO BLAME FOR THAT\nCHAOS THAT ENSUED LAST NIGHT. POLICE BLAME AGITATE ORS FOR\nSTARTING IT. OF COURSE, I TALKED TO\nDEMONSTRATORS TODAY AND THEY SAID THEY DID NOT TURN VIOLENT\nUNTIL THE TEAR GAS CANS STARTED.

HOW DO THEY RELEASE INFORMATION?\nTHERE IS A SHOOTING INVESTIGATION AT THE VERY\nBEGINNING OF THE THING. IN MOST ORGANIZATIONS, ONCE THAT\nHAPPENS, IT IS CLOSED AND CLOISTERED ENVIRONMENT.\nTHERE MAY BE A NECESSITY TO COME OUT AND SAY SOMETHING TODAY.\n>> THE PROBLEM IS THERE WAS A GUN OR THERE WASN'T A GUN.\nTHERE WAS A BOOK OR THERE WASN'T A BOOK.\nBECAUSE OF THE WAY IT UNFOLDED, I THINK THERE ARE CONCERNS OF\nWHATEVER THE FACTS, ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER, THEY WILL NOT BELIEVE\nIT. >> THE POLICE CHIEF SAID THERE\nWAS NO BOOK.

IT SHINES MORE OF A SPOTLIGHT ON\nTHE PROBLEM. IT IS NOT MEANT TO BE\nCOMFORTABLE. THE PROTESTER -- AGAIN, I'M NOT\nADVOCATING VIOLENCE. VANDALISM IS AWFUL.\nWHEN PROTESTS BECOME VIOLENT, IT IS A REAL PROBLEM.\nHOWEVER, AS CHRISTINE POINTS OUT, MARTIN LUTHER KING SAID\nRIOTING IS THE LANGUAGE OF THE UNHEARD.\n>> IT IS USEFUL TO DISSEMINATE PROPERTY DAMAGE AND DAMAGE TO\nLIVES. WE SAW ONE LIFE ALMOST TAKEN\nLAST NIGHT. A PERSON IN CRITICAL CONDITION.\nTHERE IS A DIFFERENCE WITH THE STORE BROKEN INTO AND CASH\nREGISTERS STOLEN AND PROPERTY DAMAGE HAS SEVERE CONSEQUENCES.\nIT IS DIFFERENT THAN THE LOSS OF A LIFE.\nI KNOW THAT WE SEE THAT COMMENTARY ONLINE EVERY TIME\nSOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS.
