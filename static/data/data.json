SPEAKING IN COLORADO SATURDAY\nNIGHT, TRUMP TOOK TO THE STAGE AND ANNOUNCED THE BOMBING TO THE\nCROWD ADDING, QUOTE, NOBODY KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING ON.\nASKED BY NBC NEWS TO RESPOND, TRUMP IS ALSO CALLING THE\nEXPLOSION OF THE BOMBING SAYING IT WAS TOO EARLY TO JUMP TO\nCONCLUSIONS. SHE LATER RELEASED A STATEMENT\nCONDEMNING THE APPARENT TERRORIST ATTACKS.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE OF NBC NEWS IS IN WASHINGTON, D.C. AND JOINS US\nNOW. EDWARD, WHAT IS THE LATEST?\nAND WHAT ARE PEOPLE'S RESPONSES, WHAT HAVE THEY BEEN TO DIFFERING\nINITIAL COMMENTS BY THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES?\n>> WELL, LOUISA, THERE'S 50 DAYS LEFT UNTIL THE ELECTION AND\nFOLKS HAVE TO DECIDE WHO THEY WANT AS PRESIDENT.\nBOTH OF THE CANDIDATES ARE CAMPAIGNING TODAY AND WILL BE IN\nBATTLEGROUND STATES. DONALD TRUMP TWEETED OUT TRYING\nTO USE THE BOMBING ATTACKS AND THE STABBING THAT HAPPENED TO\nSEPARATE HIMSELF FROM HILLARY CLINTON.\nHE TWEETED OUT SAYING THAT THE FAILED OBAMA/CLINTON POLICIES\nWILL NOT KEEP US SAFE. HIS CAMPAIGN MANAGER SAYS THAT\nVOTERS WANT TO TALK ABOUT ISSUES LIKE SAFETY AND SECURITY AND\nMOVE ON FROM THE BIRTHER CONTROVERSY, WHICH DOMINATED THE\nNEWS ON FRIDAY. NOW HILLARY CLINTON RESPONDED TO\nTHE ATTACKS ALSO. SHE SAID THAT WE HAVE TO SUPPORT\nOUR FIRST RESPONDERS. CLINTON ALSO SAYING WE NEED TO\nPRAY FOR THE VICTIMS IN THIS CASE, SECURITY IS LIKELY TO\nBECOME AN ISSUE THIS WEEK IN THE CAMPAIGNS.\nCLINTON'S RUNNING MATE SENATOR TIM KAINE SAID THAT HE CALLED\nTHE COMMENTS FROM DONALD TRUMP ASKING THE SECRET SERVICE AGENTS\nWHO PROTECT HILLARY CLINTON TO DISARM THEMSELVES, DANGEROUS.\nHE SAID IT SHOWS INDIFFERENCE TO VIOLENCE THAT MAY OCCUR TO THE\nCANDIDATE. NOW DONALD TRUMP MADE THOSE\nCOMMENTS BECAUSE OF HILLARY CLINTON'S STANCE ON GUN CONTROL.\nIT'S A VERY TESTY ELECTION. THE POLLS ARE NARROWING.\nIN FACT, CLINTON IS LOSING GROUND AMONG YOUNGER VOTERS.\nFOR EXAMPLE, IN MICHIGAN, THE NEWEST OR LATEST POLLS SHOW THAT\nCLINTON'S LEAD IS NOW JUST SEVEN POINTS OVER DONALD TRUMP AMONG\nVOTERS UNDER 35 YEARS OLD. LOUISA, CAROLIN.\n>> EDWARD LAWRENCE JOINING US",

HE DOES DIFFERENT THINGS AND\nDEFIES. PART OF HIS PATTERN IS THAT HE\nKIEPD KIND OF STAYS ON MESSAGE FOR A WHILE.\nHE AVOIDS SAYING INFLAMMATORY THINGS AND HIS POLL NUMBERS GO\nUP AND THEN HE GETS SLOPPY AND SAYS SOMETHING REALLY\nINFLAMMATORY AND ALUNATES A LOT OF PEOPLE AND HIS POLL NUMBERS\nFALL. IT IS WHERE ARE WE IN THAT\nCYCLE?

SO YES, YOU'RE AT RISK FOR\nPERHAPS BEING EXPOSED AS YOU SAID BECAUSE THE MODERATOR AND\nYOUR OPPONENT ARE GOING TO PUSH DEEPER AND DEEPER.\nIT'S NOT JUST ONE SOUND BITE AND MOVE ON.\nTHE WAY THESE DEBATE RULES ARE SET UP IS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT\n15 MINUTES DEDICATED TO A SPECIFIC TOPIC YAIR.\nAND IT'S ALL ABOUT DIGGING DEEPER.\nWE HAVEN'T SEEN DONALD TRUMP DO THAT A TON THROUGHOUT THIS\nELECTION AND YET -- >> A TON.\n>> -- IT COULD BE -- BUT IT COULD BE, CHRIS, THAT HIS -- HIS\nQUALITIES OF BEING SEEN AS THE STRONGER LEADER, AS BEING SEEN\nAS BETTER ON TERRORISM, JUST BECAUSE OF HIS RHETORICS, COULD\nBE STILL QUITE APPEALING ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF A\nRECENT ATTACK. >> WE HAVE A SHORT EXAMPLE OF\nTHE CANDIDATES' DIFFERENT STYLES WHEN THEY GOT THIS NEWS THAT\nTHERE WAS A BOMBING IN NEW YORK AND THIS THREAT THEY BOTH MADE\nSTATEMENTS AND THEY WERE QUITE DIFFERENT.\nTAKE A LISTEN TO THIS. >> JUST BEFORE I GOT OFF THE\nPLANE, A BOMB WENT OFF IN NEW YORK.\nWE BETTER GET VERY TOUGH, FOLKS. WE BETTER GET VERY, VERY TOUGH.\n>> I THINK IT'S ALWAYS WISER TO WAIT UNTIL YOU HAVE INFORMATION\nBEFORE MAKING CONCLUSIONS. >> SORT OF SEE THEIR SIGNATURE\nSTYLES THERE, UNDERSTATED, VERSUS, YOU KNOW, DONALD TRUMP\nJUST SORT OF SIZING IT ALL UP, EVEN WITHOUT THE DETAILS.\n>> YEAH, LISTEN, I THINK HILLARY CLINTON IT WAS APPARENT HAD A\nVERY CLEAR INTENT ON SATURDAY NIGHT TO WANT TO DRAW THAT\nCONTRAST ALISYN WITH DONALD TRUMP.\nYOU KNOW, SAYING I THINK YOU HAVE TO WAIT TO GET INFORMATION.\nTRYING AGAIN TO PORTRAY HIM AS JUST TOO RISKY, NEVER MIND THAT\nIT MIGHT BE SEEN AS SOME EMPTY RHETORIC AND HE DOESN'T HAVE THE\nPOLICY GOODS TO BACK IT UP. BUT TOO RISKY BECAUSE HE'S TOO\nQUICK TO JUMP ON SOMETHING WITHOUT ALL THE INFORMATION.\nI HAVE LITTLE DOUBT THAT TODAY ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL BOTH\nCANDIDATES OBVIOUSLY WILL ADDRESS THIS.\nBUT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN WANT TO DRAW\nTHIS CONTRAST AGAIN JUST LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO SEE DONALD TRUMP\nAS HE WAS TWEETING LAST NIGHT TRYING TO SAY THAT THE\nOBAMA/CLINTON POLICIES HAVE ALLOWED US TO GET TO THIS\nMOMENT. >> CONFIDENCE VERSUS COMPETENCE.\nTHAT'S WHAT YOU SEE IN THE TWO APPROACHES.\n>> INTERESTING WAY TO SIZE IT UP.\nDAVID CHALIAN, THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE WITH YOUR\nPERSPECTIVE. >> THANKS, GUYS.\n>> MUCH MORE OF CNN'S BREAKING COVERAGE WILL CONTINUE WHEN\n\"NEWSROOM\" WITH CAROL COSTELLO BEGINS AFTER THIS VERY SHORT\nBREAK.

HE SAID HE'S BEYOND REPAIR,\nTRUMP, UNFIT TO BE COMMANDER IN CHIEF.\nHOW DOES TRUMP DEAL WITH THIS KIND OF CRITICISM, HOW CAN HE\nOVERCOME IT IN ORDER TO GET HIMSELF ELECTED?\n>> WELL, WE'VE SEEN HOW HE'S TRIED TO DEAL WITH IT.\nHE BLOWS IT OFF AND BELITTLES THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING AFTER\nHIM. AND YOU KNOW WHAT, CERTAINLY BOB\nGATES IS NOT THE FIRST PERSON TO HAVE BEEN IN THE JOB, WHETHER IT\nWAS UNDER THE REPUBLICAN -- MOST RECENT REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT\nGEORGE W. BUSH OR PRESIDENT OBAMA WHO HAVE SAID THAT HE IS\nNOT THE RIGHT GUY TO BE COMMANDER IN CHIEF.\nAND IF YOU'RE THE KIND OF PERSON OUT THERE WHO DAVID JUST\nDESCRIBED, WHO HE'S APPEALING TO, THE KIND OF PERSON WHO LOOKS\nAT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE WORLD, IS FRIGHTENED FOR EXACTLY WHAT\nWE SAW OVER THE WEEKEND, THEN IF YOU HEAR OF PEOPLE LIKE BOB\nGATES OR OTHER FORMER OFFICIALS, IT'S JUST LIKE NOISE TO THEM.\nAND DONALD TRUMP CAN AND IS TURNING IT INTO WHY ARE YOU\nGOING TO LISTEN TO THESE GUYS WHO GOT US INTO THE PROBLEMS\nTHAT WE'RE IN? AND BY THE WAY, HILLARY CLINTON\nWAS PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION THAT KIND OF ALLOWED ISIS TO\nSTART. I MEAN, YOU HEARD THAT OVER AND\nOVER AGAIN FROM DONALD TRUMP AND CERTAINLY MORE SO TODAY.\nSO, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT SURE THAT IT REALLY MATTERS THAT MUCH IN\nTHE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS, BECAUSE THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO\nA LOT OF VOTERS ARE LOOKING AT SAYING, MORE OF THE SAME.\nTHAT'S WHY THEY WANT DONALD TRUMP.\n>> YOU KNOW, BRIANNA, ONE WEEK FROM TONIGHT IS THE FIRST\nPRESIDENTIAL DEBATE AT HOFSTRA UNIVERSITY ON LONG ISLAND ISLAND\nIN NEW YORK. WE NOW HAVE BEEN TOLD THE DEBATE\nMODERATOR, LESTER HOLT, OF NBC NEWS, HAS CHOSEN SECURING\nAMERICA AS ONE OF THREE OVERARCHING THEMES IN THE\nDEBATE. OBVIOUSLY THAT'S VERY TIMELY\nGIVEN WHAT'S HAPPENED OVER THE WEEKEND.\n>> IT IS, AND -- OF COURSE, IT IS, BUT I THINK THERE'S ALSO\nTHIS QUESTION OF ARE VOTERS REALLY CARING ABOUT THAT, RIGHT?\nTHAT'S SORT OF THE QUESTION. HERE WE ARE, WE'RE SO CLOSE TO\nTHE ELECTION, BUT I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ALSO STRUCK BY\nEVENTS LIKE THIS HAPPENING AND VERY QUICKLY IN THE\nCONSCIOUSNESS OF VOTERS, IT KIND OF TAPERS OFF.\nYOU KNOW, MAYBE IF IT HAPPENED VERY CLOSE TO THE ELECTION, BUT\nHERE WE ARE TWO MONTHS OUT AND YOU WONDER IF SOMETHING LIKE\nTHIS IS GOING TO STICK. IT DOES SEEM, AND IT SEEMS LIKE\nTHE CANDIDATES ARE PLAYING MORE TO THE EMOTIONS, THE THINGS LIKE\nTHIS EVOKE. HILLARY CLINTON IS SAYING DO YOU\nWANT SOMEONE WHO IS DANGEROUS? DONALD TRUMP IS SAYING DO YOU\nWANT SOMEONE WHO IS WEAK? DONALD TRUMP IS SORT OF\nAPPEALING I THINK TO PEOPLE AT THE GUT LEVEL.\nHE'S SAYING, AS YOU SAID, DEAL WITH THE REFUGEE ISSUE, BUT WHEN\nYOU TALK TO SECURITY EXPERTS, THEY SAY EVEN THOUGH WHEN YOU\nLOOK AT WHO HAS COMMITTED ACTS OF TERROR IN THE U.S. AND YOU\nSEE THAT IT'S -- YOU SEE THAT IT'S NOT REALLY PEOPLE WHO ARE\nON VISAS LIKE THEY WERE FOR 9/11, ACTUALLY THAT'S WHERE THE\nGAPING SECURITY HOLE IS. THAT'S WHY YOU HEARD HILLARY\nCLINTON TODAY SAYING WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THE VISA PROGRAM.\nSO SHE'S KIND OF TARGETING MORE THE BRAIN AND HE'S TARGETING\nMORE THE GUT. I THINK THAT'S WHAT VOTERS WILL\nBE DECIDING IN SORT OF A MORE -- I THINK IT WILL COME DOWN TO\nSOMETHING A LITTLE MORE GENERAL AND SORT OF A FEELING, NOT JUST\nPOLICY. >> FIRST DEBATE ONE WEEK FROM\nTONIGHT, OF COURSE, WE'LL HAVE EXTENSIVE ALL-DAY COVERAGE OF\nTHAT.",

THE CHALLENGE FOR MRS. CLINTON\nIS SHE IS KNOWN BY ABOUT 70% OF AMERICAN VOTERS TO BE SERIALLY\nDISHONEST, AND WHEN YOU HAVE THAT KIND OF REPUTATION, VOTERS\nDON'T BELIEVE YOU ON ANYTHING, SO THERE IS A HUGE AMOUNT OF\nSKEPTICISM. AS TO WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE\nGETTING THE TRUTH, WHOLE TRUTH, AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH ABOUT\nHER CURRENT HEALTH. THE CONCERNS ARE THREEFOLD,\nNUMBER ONE, ARE WE GETTING EVERYTHING OR IS THERE SOMETHING\nMORE SERIOUS WRONG WITH HER AND DO WE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW THAT.\nSECONDLY, ALL THE STATEMENTS FROM HER DOCTORS ARE CURRENT\nSTATEMENTS ABOUT ALLERGIES AND SO ON.\nVOTERS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HER PAST, THE CONCUSSION, THE\nANTICOAGULANT TREATMENT AND SO ON.\nI THINK DEMANDING A FULL NEUROLOGICAL WORK UP AND REPORT\nIS NOT UNREASONABLE GIVEN HER HEALTH, AND FINALLY PEOPLE ARE\nWORRIED ABOUT THE WOODROW WILSON INCIDENT, WHETHER SHE'S ELECTED\nAND INCAPACITATED IN SOME WAY -- >> WOW, YOU'RE REALLY RUNNING\nWITH THIS ONE. >> THOSE CONCERNS ARE REALLY OUT\nTHERE. >> WE SHOULD POINT OUT DONALD\nTRUMP IS ONLY GIVING HIS CURRENT HEALTH REPORT, AS WELL, AND HE'S\nNOT GOING BACK OVER HIS HISTORY, EVEN THOUGH THERE'S NOTHING WE\nKNOW ABOUT PRIOR INCIDENTS.

THIS WAS, IN ADDITION TO WHAT IT\nSHOWED ABOUT HIS VIEWS OF THE CANDIDATE, FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE\nOUT THERE IN AMERICA, WAS A WINDOW ON THE WASHINGTON\nESTABLISHMENT, HOW THEY CHAT AMONGST THEMSELVES AND WHAT\nREALLY CONCERNS THEM, AND IT WAS A PICTURE OF A RATHER PETTY AND\nGOSSIPY WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT.\n>> LET'S TURN TO THE FIRST DEBATE, WHICH STARTS, WHICH\nHAPPENS A WEEK FROM TOMORROW.

SHE'S DOING A LOT OF PREPARING\nAND, FRANKLY, HILLARY CLINTON TENDS TO DO WELL IN FORUMS LIKE\nTHIS WHERE YOU CAN PREPARE, WHERE THE SITUATION IS\nCONTROLLED. I THINK IT'S WORTH NOTING SHE'S\nPROBABLY MORE EXPERIENCED DOING PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES THAN JUST\nABOUT ANYONE ELSE IN THE COUNTRY, SHE DID THEM IN 2008,\nSHE DID THEM AGAIN IN THIS PRIMARY, SO THIS IS A FORUM THEY\nEXPECT SHE CAN DO WELL, THE WILD CARD HERE, OF COURSE, IS DONALD\nTRUMP. THEY SIMPLY DON'T KNOW WHICH\nDONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO SHOW UP, THE ONE WHO'S READING FROM\nTHE TELEPROMPTERS AND FOLLOWING ADVICE OF HIS AIDES, OR THE ONE\nGOING OFF MESSAGE, SO I THINK SHE'S PREPARING FOR BOTH\nPOSSIBILITIES. >> KARL, AS THE ONE PERSON AT\nTHE TABLE THAT'S HELPED SOMEONE PREPARE FOR A PRESIDENTIAL\nDEBATE AND DONE IT SEVERAL TIMES, WHAT SHOULD THEY BE\nFOCUSING ON ONE WEEK OUT? >> WELL, ACTUALLY, TWO THINGS.\nONE IS, WHAT IS THE IMPRESSION THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE OF\nTHE CANDIDATE, GOOD OR BAD, AND SECOND, HOW CAN THEY FURTHER THE\nBETTER ASPECTS OF THAT IN THE DEBATE BY THEIR PERFORMANCE.\nTHESE DEBATES DON'T TEND TO DRIVE THE RACE IN ENTIRELY\nDIFFERENT DIRECTION, AT LEAST NOT UNLESS WE HAVE A TRAIN\nWRECK, THEY TEND TO CONFIRM THINGS PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT\nCANDIDATES, GOOD OR BAD. SO TRY AND FIND GOOD POINTS AND\nEMPHASIZE THOSE GOOD POINTS. >> IF YOU WERE IN THE CORNER,\nWHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO HILLARY CLINTON AND WHAT WOULD YOU SAY\nTO DONALD TRUMP? >> I'D SAY TO HILLARY CLINTON\nYOU'VE BEEN EMPHASIZING A VISION FOR THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY,\nSHARE THINGS IN A WAY THAT HELP PEOPLE WALK AWAY SAYING I CAN\nSEE HER IN THE OVAL OFFICE AND SHE'S GOT A VISION.\nFOR DONALD TRUMP, IT IS SIMILAR. STAY AWAY FROM THE AD HOC AND\nIMPROMPTU. HIS GOAL, HER JOB IS TO\nPERSUADE. IN A TIME YOU WANT CHANGE, YOU\nWANT ME, STABILITY AND CONTINUITY.\nFOR HIM IT IS, REASSURANCE THAT I REPRESENT CHANGE, YOU ALL KNOW\nTHAT, BUT IN A TIME YOU'RE A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT ME, I\nWANT TO COME OFF AS THE GUY WHO HAD THAT NEWS CONFERENCE IN\nMEXICO CITY, OR WENT TO DETROIT AND MET WITH PEOPLE AT THE BLACK\nCHURCH, AND THE GUY WHO READS OFF THE TELEPROMPTER, NOT THE\nGUY WHO TELLS BOB COSTAS, I DON'T KNOW, OR SAYS ON -- IN\nMIAMI, TAKE AWAY HER SECURITY DETAILS, GO AHEAD AND SEE WHAT\nHAPPENS. >> AND WHAT IF, AND YOU HAVE TO\nASSUME AT SOME POINT THE MODERATOR IS GOING TO BRING UP\nTHE THINGS, THE TERRIBLE THINGS THEY'VE SAID ABOUT EACH OTHER.\nWHAT'S THE DANGER TO THE DEGREE -- THEY'VE BOTH SAID THE\nOTHER ONE IS UNFIT. >> WELL, LOOK, AGAIN, WHAT'S\nYOUR GOAL? YOUR GOAL OUGHT TO BE, OF COURSE\nWE SAY TOUGH THINGS. THAT'S THE WAY AMERICAN POLITICS\nIS. >> DO YOU NOT WANT TO MAKE THE\nCONTRAST AT ALL? >> YOU WANT THE CONTRAST BY\nBEING MORE ABOUT YOU THAN THEM. YOU WANT TO SPEND MORE TIME\nEMPHASIZING WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT RATHER THAN WHAT THEY'RE ABOUT.\n>> WOW. THAT SOUNDS LIKE A REALLY BIASED\nDEBATE. >> IT WILL BE QUIETER THAN THE\nONES IN THE PRIMARIES. IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE\nHOW DONALD TRUMP PERFORMS WHERE THERE'S NO AUDIENCE TO EGG HIM\nON AND CHEER AND ROAR. >> THERE'S AN AUDIENCE, BUT I\nWILL TELL YOU, THEY ARE STRICTLY TOLD QUIET.\nDON'T SAY ANYTHING AND LEAVE IT TO THE MILLIONS OF AMERICAN\nVOTERS TO WATCH AND DECIDE. THANK YOU, PANEL.\nSEE YOU NEXT SUNDAY.",

UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF OBAMA\nAND CLINTON AMERICANS HAVE EXPERIENCED MORE ATTACKS AT HOME\nTHAN VICTORIES ABROAD. TIME TO CHANGE THE PLAYBOOK.\nSEVEN DAYS BEFORE DEBATE NUMBER ONE.\nNOW A SIGNIFICANT NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE.\nKATIE, START. ABOUT CHANGING THE PLAYBOOK.\nHOW FAR DOES THAT GO? >> YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND\nHILLARY CLINTON IS PART OF BARACK OBAMA FOREIGN POLICY.\nFOR THE SECOND HALF OF HIS TERM AT SECRETARY OF STATE.\nTHE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION LIED TO THE AMERICAN VOTER WHEN THEY\nSAID AL QAEDA WAS ON THE RUN. THEY SIGNIFICANTLY DOWNPLAYED\nTHE THREAT FROM ISIS IN THE UNITED STATES BY HAVING\nINTELLIGENCE REPORTS SCRUBBED AND PAINT A ROSIER PICTURE SO\nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE FELT THERE WASN'T SO MUCH OF A THREAT.\nHILLARY CLINTON ISSUED A STATEMENT SAYING THE APPARENT\nTERRORIST ATTACKS IN NEW JERSEY AND NEW YORK.\nWHY ARE WE STILL NOT CALLING THE ENEMY WHAT IT IS AND SAYING WHAT\nWE ARE DEALING WITH.

THE TOUGH THING FOR HER RIGHT\nNOW IS TODAY SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO KICK OFF THIS APPEAL TO\nMILLENNIALS. SHE'S IN A BOX.\nSHE WOULD HAVE BEEN TOUGHER ON ASSAD, SHE WOULD HAVE TAKEN A\nDIFFERENT ATTACK ON SYRIA AND ATTACK.\nWE KNOW THAT FROM HER OWN BOOK, FROM EVERYBODY WHO SAID THEY\nDISAGREED WITH OBAMA. SHE CAN AFFORD TO BE MORE TOUGH\nSOUNDING. BUT THAT'S FROM ME.\nI'M NOT HER AUDIENCE. THE MILLENNIALS ARE HER AUDIENCE\nFOR THIS WEEK IN PARTICULAR. THEY ARE AFRAID OF HER\nHAWKISHNESS. >> SHE'S MORE HAWKISH THAT\nOBAMA. >> THAT'S THE THING THAT\nMILLENNIALS DON'T LIKE ABOUT HER.\nOR TUCKER. >> TUCKER DOESN'T LIKE THAT?\n>> I DON'T SEE HOW ANY NORMAL PERSON COULD LOOK AT LIBYA AND\nSAY, IF YOU ARE GOING TO KNOCK OFF THE LEADER OF THIS COUNTRY,\nAND HOPE THAT SOMETHING GOOD HAPPENS, ESPECIALLY AFTER\nWATCHING WHAT HAPPENED IN IRAQ. WHO WOULD REACH THAT CONCLUSION?\nNOT A WISE PERSON. I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR TO BLAME\nISIS ON HER EXCLUSIVELY. BUT THAT DID MAKE THE WORLD\nWORSE. SHE'S NEVER ACCOUNTED FOR IT.\nTHAT'S A -- >> ARAB SPRING.\n>> LET ME LOOK AT THE NUMBERS. THE NUMBERS ARE THAT THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE TRUST REPUBLICANS MORE IN DEALING WITH\nTERRORISM, ABOUT 51/45 IN GENERAL.\nWHEN IT COMES TO THE BETTER CANDIDATE TO BE IN COMMANDER IN\nCHIEF, IT'S 50/40, CLINTON OVER TRUMP.\n>> LOOK, SHE SOUNDS KIND OF A LITTLE BIT -- I DON'T KNOW, LOW,\nKIND OF NOT VERY KIND OF UP ON THINGS.\nI DON'T KNOW HER. HER AFFECT SEEMS DEPRESSED.\nSHE CAN SHOW A LITTLE BIT MORE KIND OF OUTRAGE OR SOMETHING.\nI HEAR WHAT DANA IS SAYING ABOUT THE MILLENNIALS.\nBUT I THINK THERE'S OTHER PEOPLE OUT THERE.\nIF SHE WANTS TO HOLD ON TO MILLENNIALS BUT WHAT ABOUT THE\nINDEPENDENTS, WHAT ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER VOTERS SHE COULD TRY\nTO PICK OFF IN BATTLEGROUND STATES?\nSHE'S IN A TOUGH POSITION. THIS IS NOT WHERE SHE WANTED TO\nBE 50 DAYS OUT. >> SHE SAYS SHE HAS THE RESOLVE\nAND KNOW HOW, THE EXPERIENCE. TRUMP CLEARLY HAS A STYLE THAT\nAPPEALS TO ANYBODY WHO SAYS GO GET THOSE BAD GUYS.\n>> I'M SORRY, SHE LOOKED WEAK. SHE'S PROJECTING THE IMAGE OF AN\nOUT OF TOUCH BUREAUCRAT. WHEN SHE WAS ON THAT PLANE,\nSHE -- HER HEAD WAS IN THE CLOUDS.\nTHIS ISN'T ABOUT YOGA. WHEN YOU SEE HER GET ANGRY ABOUT\nSTUFF AND HER VOICE GOES UP, IT'S NEVER ABOUT THIS STUFF.\nIT'S ALWAYS ABOUT IDENTITY OR OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT.\nBUT IT'S NEVER ABOUT THE THREATS AGAINST THE UNITED STATES.\nTHE WORLD IS SHAPING THIS ELECTION.\nIT MAY NOT BE THAT AMERICA REJECTS HILLARY.\nIT'S THAT THE WORLD IS REJECTING HILLARY.\nTHE EVENTS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE RIGHT NOW ARE BASICALLY SAYING,\nWE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS PERSON.\nWE NEED SOMEBODY WHO PROJECTS STRENGTH, EVEN IF IT'S JUST A\nPERCEPTION. >> I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THE\nSTRENGTH. I WOULD UNDERSTAND THIS F THAT\nWAS TO GO AFTER ISIS WHERE THEY ARE OR LIBYA.\nIF YOU ARE GOING TO USE THE MILITARY, WHAT COMES AFTER THAT?\nIN THE MEANTIME, RAHAMI, HE LIVES HERE.\nHE IS A NATURALIZED AMERICAN. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO SHOOT HIM\nFULL OF BULLETS. >> I'M TALKING ABOUT THE\nPERCEPTION OF HILLARY. >> YOU LIKE THE --\n>> I'M SAYING, I DON'T LIKE -- >> SHE SEEMS OUT OF IT.\n>> I DON'T THINK SHE'S A WEAK PERSON.\n>> SHE SE SEEMS OUT OF IT.",

AND IN THIS ELECTION,\nHILLARY CLINTON IS SORT OF RUNNING AS THE INCUMBENT.\nSO TO THE EXTENT THAT SHE IS INHERITING THE MANTEL OF\nINCUMBENCY HERE SHE HAS TO INHERIT WHAT PEOPLE THINK IS\nWRONG WITH THE COUNTRY AS FAR AS DEFENDING AMERICAN\nCITIZENS AND AMERICAN SOIL FROM TERRORISM.\nON THE OTHER HAND, SHE DOESN'T REALLY POSSESS THE\nSAME PERSONAL POLITICAL SKILLS AS BARACK OBAMA.\nSO SHE GETS ALL THE WARTS OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION\nFAILURES AS PEOPLE PERCEIVE IT BUT SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE\nSAME POLITICAL SKILLS TO OVERCOME IT THAT HE DID IN\nTWO ELECTIONS. >> SO YOUR THOUGHT WOULD BE\nTHAT WHEN THE POLLING COMES OUT THAT BEGINS TO REFLECT\nWHAT HAPPENED OVER THE WEEKEND, IT IS LIKELY TO ADD\nTO DONALD TRUMP'S MOMENTUM? >> I THINK SO.\nIF YOU LOOK INSIDE THE RECENT FOX NEWS POLL, YOU\nSEE THAT THEY ARE IN A VIRTUAL DEAD HEAT ON WHO\nVOTERS TRUST TO HANDLE TERRORISM.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS NO -- >> ONE POINT.\n>> HE HAS NO EXPERIENCE AT ALL DEALING WITH THIS.\nSHE WAS SENATOR DURING 9/11. AND UNITED STATES SECRETARY\nOF STATE. AND, YET, VOTERS HAVE A ONE\nPOINT DIFFERENCE IN WHO THEY TRUST TO HANDLE TERRORISM.\nTHAT TELLS ME THEY ARE NOT PUTTING MUCH INTO STOCK INTO\nHER EXPERIENCE WHEN IT COMES TO TOGETHER WITH THESE\nMATTERS. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE WORLD\nFEELS OUT OF CONTROL, LESS THAN 50 DAYS BEFORE AN\nELECTION, I THINK THAT HELPS TRUMP BECAUSE THEY'RE LIKELY\nTO BLAME THE OBAMA CLINTON ADMINISTRATION FOR THE\nFAILURES THAT ARE LEADING TO THE FEELING OF US BEING OUT\nOF CONTROL. >> WHAT ABOUT THE FACT THAT\nHER PLAN FOR ADDRESSING THIS PROBLEM OF TERRORISM IS MORE\nFLUSHED OUT. MORE DETAILED THAN\nMR. TRUMP'S? THE TRUMP PLAN HE LIKES TO\nSAY THAT HE DOESN'T WANT TO GIVE IT AWAY BECAUSE HE\nDOESN'T WANT TO LET THE ENEMY KNOW WHAT HE IS GOING\nTO BE UP, TO BUT WON'T PEOPLE -- AREN'T PEOPLE\nLIKELY TO EXPECT MORE THAN A RATHER GENERAL PLAN?\n>> I THINK THEY WILL EXPECT MORE.\nAND HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO COME UP WITH MORE DETALTD\nANSWERS A WEEK FROM TONIGHT IN THE FIRST DEBATE.\nTHE TROUBLE WITH HILLARY'S PLAN IT IS LARGELY THE SAME\nPLAN THAT OBAMA HAS BEEN RUNNING.\nIF YOU ARE SOMEONE WHO THINKS THE COUNTRY IS OFF ON\nTHE WRONG TRACK, WHICH IS A VAST MAJORITY OF LIKELY\nVOTERS IN EVERY SURVEY OUT THERE, THEN YOU THINK THE\nTERRORISM PLAN THAT OBAMA HAS BEEN RUNNING AND THAT\nCLINTON IS ENDORSING IS NOT WORKING.  SO IT STRIKES ME\nTHAT HER CHALLENGE IS TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING\nDIFFERENT THAN WHAT THEY HAVE ALREADY BEEN DOING.\nAND TRUMP'S CHALLENGE IS TO COME UP WITH MORE SPECIFICS\nAND BOTH OF THESE THINGS ARE GOING TO COME TO A HEAD A\nWEEK FROM TONIGHT IN THE FIRST DEBATE.\n>> NOW, WHAT ABOUT THAT IN YOUR JUDGMENT?\nIT'S NOT SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON NATIONAL SECURITY\nAS ONE OF THE LATER KEY BAITS WILL BE.\nBUT IT'S OBVIOUSLY GOING TO COME UP, PARTICULARLY IN\nLIGHT OF THIS WEEKEND'S TERRORIST BOMBINGS.\nCOULD SHE REVERSE THE POSSIBLE ADVANTAGE?\nMIGHT SHE WITH HER MUCH DEEPER KNOWLEDGE OF THESE\nEVENTS HAVING LIVED THEM TO SO LONG PEOPLE HAVE WITH\nCOURSE OF EVENT? >> SHE IS GOING TO HAVE TO\nCOME UP WITH SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN PEOPLE HAVE\nBEEN HEARING. ONE OF THE THINGS HURTING\nTHE DEMOCRATIC TICKET AND REALLY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY\nIN THIS YEAR'S ELECTION IS THAT PEOPLE HAVE COME TO\nHEAR THESE THINGS AS PAN PABLEM WE DON'T CALL IT WHAT IT IS.\nTHERE IS A LOT OF PABLEM. YOU HEAR THESE THINGS OVER\nAND OVER AGAIN AND YOU TUNE IT OUT.\nI HAVE HEARD IT BEFORE AND DON'T FEEL ANY SAFER.\nSHE HAS TO COME UP WITH DIFFERENT LANGUAGE AND WAY\nTO DESCRIBE WHAT SHE WANTS TO DO AND NEW TWIST ON HOW\nTO FIGHT TERRORISM. RIGHT NOW, GIVEN WHAT'S IN\nTHE NEWS, PEOPLE ARE JUDGING THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS\nSIMPLY NOT WORKING. WE HAVE EIGHT YEARS OF THIS\nPLAN THAT SHE IS ENDORSING. WE DON'T FEEL ANY SAFER.\nWE HAVE ATTACKS ON AMERICAN SOIL AS WE ARE ON THE CUSP\nOF A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. IT'S REALLY EASY FOR DONALD\nTRUMP TO HIT THOSE SOFTBALLS OUT OF THE PARK.\nALTHOUGH YOU CAN'T HIDE IN A TWO PERSON DEBATE.\nHE HAVE TO COME UP WITH MORE SPECIFICS NEXT MONDAY NIGHT\nAND IN THE FUTURE DEBATES THAT ARE FOCUSED ON THIS\nISSUE. IT WON'T BE ENOUGH TO SAY\nWHAT HE IS SAYING. RIGHT NOW HE HAS GOT THE\nADVANTAGE BECAUSE CLINTON IS DEFENDING A RECORD THAT\nSEEMS TO BE FAILING AS WE WATCH THE NEWS OF EVENTS\nUNFOLD. >> SCOTT, THANKS VERY MUCH.\nAND IN RESPONSE -- YOU BET. AND IN RESPONSE TO THE\nBOMBINGS IN NEW YORK CITY AND NEW JERSEY AND THE ISIS\nSTABBING IN MINNESOTA, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY JOSH\nEARNST DECLARED THAT THE U.S. LOCKED IN WHAT HE\nCALLED A NARRATIVE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS.\nWATCH. >> WHEN IT COMES TO ISIL, WE\nARE IN A FIGHT, A NARRATIVE FIGHT WITH THEM.\nA NARRATIVE BATTLE. ISIL IS TRYING TO ASSERT A\nNARRATIVE THAT THEY REPRESENT THE RELIGION OF\nISLAM IN A WAR AGAINST THE WEST AND IN A WAR AGAINST\nTHE UNITED STATES THAT IS A MITTOLOGY.\nTHAT IS A FALSEHOOD. >> JOSH EARNST MADE A\nSIMILAR ARGUMENT ON SEVERAL OTHER NETWORKS THIS MORNING.\nRIGHT NOW, LET'S SPEED READ SOME OTHER NEWS FROM THE\nWORLD OF POLITICS. PRESIDENT OBAMA URGED THE\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY TO PRESERVE HIS LEGACY BY\nTURNING OUT TO VOTE FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nOVER THE WEEKEND, THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS\nDINNER, THE PRESIDENT SAID IT WOULD BE A PERSONAL\nINSULT THAT THE BLACK COMMUNITY IS NOT ACTIVE IN\nTHE 2016 ELECTION. SENATE MINORITY LEADER HARRY\nREID WILL STILL NOT BACK DOWN FROM HIS 2012 LIE ON\nTHE SENATE FLOOR THAT MITT ROMNEY DID NOT PAY TAXES FOR\nDECADES. NEW INTERVIEW REID EVEN SAID\nQUOTE IT'S ONE OF THE BEST THINGS I HAVE EVER DONE.\nROMNEY DID RELEASE TAX RETURNS THAT SHOW HE DID,\nINDEED, PAY TAXES. TROUBLE FOR NEW JERSEY\nGOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE, PROSECUTORS NOW SAY CHRISTIE\nKNEW THAT HIS CLOSE ASSOCIATES WERE INVOLVED IN\nA 2013 PLAN TO SHUT DOWN LANES ONTO THE GEORGE\nWASHINGTON BRIDGE. THE PLAN LOCAL MAYOR\nDECLINED TO SUPPORT CHRISTIE.\nCHRISTIE SAID HE HAD NO IDEA ABOUT THE PLOT THAT HAPPENED\nUNTIL AFTER. THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS\nSPENDING AD MONEY LIKE CRAZY BUT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS\nDOING THE EXACT OPPOSITE. WHICH ONE IS DOING THE RIGHT\nTHING THIS YEAR? EXPERT PANEL IS NEXT.\nGOVERNOR MIKE PENCE WILL BE HERE IN A FEW MINUTES.\nHE JUST NAMED HIS VICE PRESIDENTIAL ROLE MODEL.\nWHO IS IT? THAT'S COMING UP.",

AND, YET, WHY DOES IT SEEM\nTO ROLL OFF HIM? >> I THINK HER ADS ARE\nBRUTAL AND I BET SHE HAS DISSUADED SOME REPUBLICANS,\nESPECIALLY WOMEN WHO REALLY YOU KNOW, RESIST DONALD\nTRUMP AND ARE INCREASINGLY WE PELLED BY DONALD TRUMP.\nAND I THINK THOSE ADS ARE GOOD TO SOLIDIFY THAT GROUP\nOF PEOPLE. BUT, SHE DOESN'T HAVE A\nMESSAGE FOR HERSELF RIGHT NOW THAT'S DRIVING HER OWN\nCANDIDACY AND SELLING HER.

THAT IS THE BATCH OF RAIN THAT'S\nACTUALLY MOVING OUT OF NEW YORK\nRIGHT NOW ON TRACK TO ARRIVE IN BOSTON AROUND 11:00 A.M.

THE NEXT BATCH OF RAIN TO WATCH\nWILL BE THIS MASS JUST ARRIVING\nIN CONNECT AND THE TRAJECTORY OF THAT WILL BRING INTO BOSTON LIKE\nI SAID JUST BEFORE LUNCH TIME\nTODAY. SO DOPPLER RADAR IS LOOKING\nPRETTY UGLY.\nTHERE YOU GO NORTH OF THE MASS PIKE, ONE SWATH OF RAIN AND DOWN\nACROSS THE RAIN ANOTHER SWATH\nARRIVING ON OUTER CAPE PROVINCETOWN AND FUTURE CAST NOT\nQUITE WET ENOUGH IN MY OPINION,\n10:00 A.M.

I'M GEORGE HOWELL.\nTHE FBI SAYS THAT ITS AGENTS AND POLICE MADE A TRAFFIC STOP\nSUNDAY NIGHT IN THAT BOMBING INVESTIGATION IN THE CHELSEA\nNEIGHBORHOOD. NO ONE HAS BEEN ARRESTED OR\nCHARGED, THOUGH, AS OF THIS POINT.\nALSO, INVESTIGATORS SAY THEY ARE LOOKING FOR A MAN THAT WAS SEEN\nIN SURVEILLANCE VIDEO AT THE SITE OF SATURDAY'S EXPLOSION AND\nNEAR WHERE POLICE FOUND THIS, A PRESSURE COOKER THAT WAS\nDISCOVERED JUST FOUR BLOCKS AWAY.\nWE'RE ALSO MONITORING NEWS OF A SUSPICIOUS PACKAGE THAT WAS\nFOUND IN ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY. THAT IS WHERE RACHEL CRANE IS\nLIVE AND JOINS US WITH THE VERY LATEST.\nRA RACHEL, WHAT MORE DO YOU KNOW?\n>> WELL, GEORGE, I JUST SPOKE WITH THE MAYOR OF ELIZABETH WHO\nDESCRIBED WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE THIS EVENING.\nHE SAID THAT TWO MEN FOUND A BACKPACK IN A TRASH CAN CLOSE TO\nTHE TRAIN STATION HERE. THEY LOOKED INSIDE THAT BACKPACK\nTHINKING THEY WERE GOING TO FIND SOMETHING PERHAPS VALUABLE.\nTHAT'S WHEN THEY SAW SOMETHING SUSPICIOUS.\nWHAT HE DESCRIBED AS MULTIPLE DEVICES.\nTHEY THEN DROPPED THE BACKPACK, WENT AROUND THE CORNER TO A\nNEARBY POLICE STATION WHERE THEY NOTIFIED THE AUTHORITIES OF WHAT\nTHEY HAD FOUND. THAT'S WHEN THE POLICE WENT TO\nTHE BACKPACK, AGREED THERE WAS SOMETHING SUSPICIOUS IN THERE.\nAND NOW THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES RESPONDED AS WELL AS THE FBI.\nTHE MAYOR ALSO TOLD US THAT THEY WERE UP TO FIVE DEVICES FOUND IN\nTHAT BACKPACK. HE SAID THAT THERE WAS NO TIMER\nON THOSE DEVICES, NO CELL PHONE ON THOSE DEVICES.\nHE ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THIS IS THE PERFECT EXAMPLE OF IF YOU\nSEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING. BECAUSE IT IS BECAUSE OF THOSE\nTWO INDIVIDUALS FINDING THIS BACKPACK, GOING TO THE POLICE\nTHAT THEY WERE ABLE TO RESPOND. NOW HE ALSO POINTED OUT THAT ONE\nOF THOSE DEVICES IN THAT BACKPACK WAS DETONATED.\nHE SAID THAT WAS BY ACCIDENT. ONE OF THE ROBOTS WAS TRYING TO\nCUT ONE OF THE WIRES AND THAT'S WHEN ONE OF THE DEVICES WENT\nOFF. ALL THE STREETS AND THE\nSURROUNDING AREA HAVE BEEN CLOSED DOWN.\nTHE NORTHEAST CORRIDOR HAS BEEN CLOSED DOWN BETWEEN NEWARK\nLIBERTY AIRPORT AS WELL AS HERE IN ELIZABETH.\nUNCLEAR OF WHEN THAT SERVICE WILL BE RESTORED.\nGEORGE? >> RACHEL, IS THERE A SENSE\nGIVEN WHAT HAPPENED? IS THERE A SENSE THAT THERE\nCOULD BE FURTHER INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS\nANYTHING ELSE OUT THERE TO DISCOVER?\n>> WELL, GEORGE, OF COURSE NEW YORK AND THE SURROUNDING AREA\nAND HERE IN NEW JERSEY, EVERYBODY IS ON THE HEIGHTEN\nALERT BECAUSE OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED RECENTLY.\nIT'S TOO EARLY TO SPECULATE WHETHER OR NOT THIS INCIDENT\nHERE IN ELIZABETH IS CONNECTED TO ANY OF THE OTHER INCIDENTS IN\nSEASIDE AND ALSO IN NEW YORK CITY.\n>> RACHEL, GIVE US A SENSE ALSO. THIS HAS BEEN A BUSY NIGHT FOR\nSURE. WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD FROM PEOPLE\nIF YOU HAD A CHANCE TO TALK TO PEOPLE, GIVEN THE NEW NEWS THAT\nYOU DISCOVERED THERE. PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THAT\nNEIGHBORHOOD, THE SENSE THAT THEY'RE FEELING?\n>> YOU KNOW, GEORGE, GEORGE, WE JUST GOT HERE MOMENTS AGO.\nTHE FIRST THING WE DID IS SPEAK TO THE MAYOR.\nHE DID SAY THAT IT'S SUNDAY EVENING.\nTHAT THIS HAS BEEN A RELATIVELY QUIET NIGHT.\nTHAT TRASH CAN WHERE THE BACKPACK WAS LOCATED, HE POINTED\nOUT IS CLOSE TO A LOCAL PUB. BUT HE SAID THAT IT'S NOT\nHEAVILY TRAFFICKED THIS EVENING BECAUSE IT IS LATE ON A SUNDAY\nNIGHT. SO AS I POINTED OUT, WE'VE ONLY\nHAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK WITH THE MAYOR AT THIS POINT.\nBUT HE DID SAY THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT NO MAYOR WANTS TO\nHAVE TO DEAL WITH, THAT THIS IS OBVIOUSLY VERY TRYING TIMES.\nAND THAT THE CITY OF ELIZABETH IS ON ALERT.\nHE ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THEY DID A SECONDARY SEARCH OF THE\nSURROUNDING AREA TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WERE NO OTHER\nADDITIONAL DEVICES. AND HE SAID THAT THAT SWEEP\nTURNED OUT NEGATIVE. AND THAT IT HAS BEEN FULFILLED.\nTHAT THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE SUSPICIOUS OTHER THAN THIS\nBACKPACK WITH MULTIPLE DEVICE, UP TO FIVE DEVICE, GEORGE.\n>> RACHEL, WE KNOW YOU AND YOUR TEAM HAVE BEEN MOVING QUICKLY TO\nGET THIS INFORMATION AND TO GET TO IT AIR WITH US.\nWE APPRECIATE THAT. WE ALSO WANT TO ASK BEFORE WE\nLEAVE YOU HERE, WE WANT TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR TO OUR VIEWERS,\nTHAT THIS SITUATION HERE, THERE IS NO CONNECTION TO THE\nSITUATION IN NEW YORK, CORRECT? >> NO, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO\nCONNECTION BETWEEN THIS INCIDENT HERE IN ELIZABETH AND THE\nINCIDENT THAT WE SAW YESTERDAY IN NEW YORK CITY.\nIT IS FAR TOO EARLY IN THIS INVESTIGATION TO BEGIN TO\nSPECULATE ABOUT THAT. RIGHT NOW WE ARE JUST DEALING\nWITH THE SITUATION HERE IN ELIZABETH.\nAND ONCE AGAIN, FAR TOO EARLY IN THIS INVESTIGATION TO SPECULATE\nOF ANY CONNECTIONS.

THE FBI CALLING THE WEEKEND\nSTABBING SPREE AT A MINNESOTA SHOPPING MALL, \"A POTENTIAL ACT\nOF TERRORISM.\" AN ISIS-LINKED NEWS AGENCY IS\nPRAISING THE ATTACKER AS A \"SOLDIER OF THE ISLAMIC STATE.\"\nROSA IS LIVE IN ST. CLOUD, MINNESOTA.\nWHAT IS THE LATEST, ROSA? >> CHRIS, GOOD MORNING.\nLET ME GET YOU UP TO SPEED HERE. ACCORDING TO POLICE ONE MAN\nUSING A PRIVATE SECURITY COMPANY UNIFORM WALK UNDER TO THE MALL\nTHAT YOU SEE BEHIND ME, MADE A REFERENCE TO ALLAH AND ASKED A\nCOUPLE OF PEOPLE IF THEY WERE MUSLIM BEFORE ATTACKING THEM\nWITH A KNIFE. NOW, AUTHORITIES ARE NOT\nIDENTIFYING THIS MAN AT THIS TIME, BUT SATURDAY NIGHT BY THE\nEND OF THE NIGHT HE HAD STABBED NINE PEOPLE.\nTHREE OF THEM ARE STILL IN THE HOSPITAL.\nONE WITH LIFE-THREATENING INJURIES.\nNOW, AUTHORITIES SAY THAT THIS COULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH WORSE.\nOFFICIAL OS WHO HAVE SEEN THE SURVEILLANCE VIDEO SAY THAT ONE\nMAN IS HAILED A HERO. OFF-DUTY POLICE OFFICER JASON\nFALCONER. THEY SAY HE SHOT AND KILLED THE\nSUSPECT IN THIS CASE AND EVEN SHOOTING HIM DOWN WHEN THIS\nSUSPECT WAS LUNGING AT HIM. NOW, LIKE YOU MENTIONED, A NEWS\nAGENCY LINKED TO ISIS HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY CALLING\nTHIS SUSPECT A SOLDIER OF THE ISLAMIC STATE.\nNOW, CNN CANNOT INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRM THOSE DETAILS, BUT, OF\nCOURSE, AS YOU MENTIONED, THE FBI IS INVESTIGATING THIS AS A\nPOSSIBLE ACT OF TERRORISM. >> ROSA, THANK YOU FOR ALL OF\nTHAT. LET'S DISCUSS ALL OF THE\nDEVELOPMENTS WITH JULIET, OUR CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST,\nPHIL MUDD AND FORMER COUNTERTERRORISM OFFICIAL AND\nMICHAEL WEISS CO-AUTHOR OF \"ISIS INSIDE THE ARMY OF TERROR.\"\nTHANKS FOR ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE.\nLET'S TALK ABOUT THESE THREE LOCATIONSS OF ALL THESE DIFFERET\nBOMBS. THE MOST RECENT ELIZABETH AT\nTHIS TRAIN STATION FOUND LAST NIGHT AND THE CHELSEA\nNEIGHBORHOOD IN MANHATTAN AND SEASIDE PARK IN NEW JERSEY ALONG\nTHE ROUTE OF WHAT WAS A CHARITY RUN.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK THE SIGNIFICANCE IS DO YOU THINK\nTHEY ARE COORDINATED? >> I THINK WE DON'T KNOW YET.\nI'LL TAKE THE FACTS AND TELL YOUR VIEWERS ABOUT THE\nCONNECTION. I THINK NO QUESTION IF WE JUST\nSTART FROM THE BEGINNING OR START FROM THE MIDDLE, WHICH IS\nTHE NEW YORK ATTACKS ON 23rd AND 27th.\nYOU HAVE THE SAME INDIVIDUAL AND VERY SIMILAR BOMBS.\nGOING BACK A DAY TO NEW JERSEY. STARTING THE WEEKEND, ALL WE\nHAVE HEARD IS THAT THERE ARE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN NEW JERSEY\nAND NEW YORK. BUT WE DON'T KNOW IF MATERIALS\nFOUND IN THE BOMBS ON SATURDAY ARE THE SAME IN NEW YORK ARE THE\nSAME AS THOSE IN NEW JERSEY. THOSE INCLUDE ALUMINUM POWER AND\nT T\nTANARITE AND THOSE ARE THINGS THAT ARE EASILY PURCHASED\nANYWHERE. WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THE\nEXPLOSIVES BUT COINCIDENCES LIKE THIS DON'T HAPPEN VERY OFTEN.\nIF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS IN THE TOTALITY, YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IT\nOVER THE COURSE OF THE WEEKEND. WHAT WE HAVE ON THE\nINVESTIGATION SIDE IS, OBVIOUSLY, THE SAME PERSON ON\nSATURDAY NIGHT, AS YOU GUYS REPORTED LAST NIGHT.\nAND VIDEO SURVEILLANCE AT VARIOUS PLACES THAT MAY HELP.\nRIGHT NOW INVESTIGATORS ARE DEPENDENT ON MATERIALS IN TERMS\nOF CONNECTING THE THINGS AND SURVEILLANCE.\nAND THAT'S ESSENTIALLY HOW THIS WILL UNFOLD.\nYOU KNOW, THERE'S THESE GUYS THAT ARE NOW JUST STOPPED IN THE\nCAR AND WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH TO SIMPLY MAKE SPECULATION OF WHAT\nTHAT IS. THAT'S WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW.\n>> MOVING VERY QUICKLY. DIFFERENT STATES, OBVIOUSLY, ALL\nWORKING IN COORDINATION WITH THE FEDS ON THIS.\nTHEY DO BELIEVE THERE'S SIMILARITIES AND DETONATION\nTECHNIQUES VERY CRUDE ONES FOUND ON THE INTERNET OR MAGAZINE\nWHERE YOU CAN FIND TO DO THIS KIND OF STUFF.\nYOU HAVE THREE PHASES. HOW THE PROSECUTORS ARE LOOKING\nAT IT, WHICH IS WHERE YOUR MIND GOES.\nHOW THE INVESTIGATORS LOOK AT THIS AND WE HAVE PHIL MUDD FOR\nTHAT AND THE LARGER MOTIVATIONS HERE AND WE HAVE MICHAEL FOR\nTHAT. PHIL, WHEN YOU'RE SIZING UP THIS\nINVESTIGATION, MULTIPLE EVENTS POPPING UP AND SIMILAR IN TERMS\nOF WHAT THESE PEOPLE DID TO PUT THE BOMBS AND HOW THEY LOOK.\nWHAT ARE THE PHASES? >> LOOK, THE FIRST PHASE IS\nOPENING UP THE FACTS. I THIRD PEOPLE, FOR EXAMPLE,\nTALK ABOUT THIS IS TERRORISM. THAT IS NOT A FACT, CHRIS.\nTHE FACT IS WE HAVE DEVICES AND THE FBI LABS SHOULD BE ABLE TO\nTELL VERY QUICKLY WHETHER, FOR EXAMPLE, THE WIRING IN THOSE\nDEVICES INDICATES THE SAME INDIVIDUAL WIRED BOTH OF THEM.\nWE HAVE VIDEO AND WE HAVE CALL INS.\nYOU MIGHT HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT A STOP OF SOME SUSPECTS OR PERSONS\nOF INTEREST. AND LICENSE PLATES FROM VEHICLES\nTHAT WERE GOING THROUGH THE AREA.\nSO, WE'RE SPECULATING ON WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED HERE BUT\nINSIDE THIS GAME INVESTIGATORS IF YOU LISTEN TO THE LAST MOMENT\nOF CONVERSATION, INVESTIGATORS HAVE A LARGE VOLUME OF DATA THAT\nTHEY'RE ALREADY STARTING TO SORT THROUGH.\nTHAT WILL TAKE THEM A COUPLE DAYS, CHRIS, BEFORE THE FACTS\nNARROW DOWN. >> HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT\nBECAUSE COMMON SENSE TELLS YOU, SOMEBODY'S DOING THIS TO DISRUPT\nOUR WAY OF LIFE. IT'S A HOMICIDAL ACT WITHOUT A\nSPECIFIC TARGET. IT'S TERRORISM.\nYOU'RE SAYING, NO. IS THAT THE MIND OF THE\nINVESTIGATOR BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO MAKE A CASE AS SUCH?\n>> NO, IT'S BECAUSE TERRORISM REQUIRES A POLITICAL MOTIVATION\nAND I DON'T KNOW THE MOTIVATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL.\nLET'S ASSUME, FOR EXAMPLE, A MALE WHO LOST HIS GIRLFRIEND AND\nWANT TO BLOW UP A BLOCK. IF YOU WANT TO TELL ME YOU KNOW\nWHAT THIS PERSON WAS TRYING TO DO, I WOULD TELL YOU, HOW WOULD\nYOU KNOW THAT? I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT THE\nMOTIVATION WAS AND WHETHER THIS WAS AN ACT OF TERROR BEFORE I\nUNDERSTAND WHAT WAS IN HIS MIND OR HER MIND.\n>> MICHAEL, NO CLAIM OF RESPONSIBILITY FROM ISIS.\nWHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO YOU? >> NOTHING.\n>> THIS COULD BE, AS PHIL WAS POINTING OUT, SOME GRIEVED\nLUNETIC WHO WANTED TO KILL AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT\nANY POLITICAL MOTIVATION. IF IT WAS JIHADIISIS HAS TWO\nMAIN TACTICS THEY CHOOSE FROM. ONE IS THE ISIS DIRECTED ATTACK\nSUCH AS PARIS AND BRUSSELS AND NICE AND THE OTHER IS THE\nISIS-INSPIRED ATTACK OR THE LONE  THE ISIS SPOKESMAN THAT THE\nCOALITION KILLED A COUPLE WEEKS IN 2014 CAME OUT WITH THIS,\nBASICALLY A GLOBAL INJUNCTION TO ALL MUSLIMS TO KILL THE INFIDEL\nWHEREVER YOU TAKE HIM. DRIVE OVER HIM, TAKE A KNIFE AND\nSTAB HIM. THESE ARE THE INDIVIDUAL\nSOLDIERS OF IT. NOW, ISIS MAY NOT KNOW IF THIS\nWAS ISIS-INSPIRED YET. THEY DID COME OUT OR CLAIM\nRESPONSIBILITY. THEY ARE NOT THE ONLY JIHADIST\nORGANIZATION. WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH YET ABOUT\nNEW YORK. MINNESOTA, I'M MORE INCLINED TO\nSAY IT'S -- >> LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.\nTHAT WAS A MALL ATTACK THAT SOMEBODY CLAIMED -- I THINK THAT\nIS ISIS-INSPIRED AND HE WAS ABLE TO STAND MULTIPLE PEOPLE BEFORE\nBEING KILLED. >> THAT IS MORE ISIS-DIRECTED.\nHE CAME OUT AND SAID HE'S A SOLDIER OF AN ISLAMIC STATE THAT\nSUGGESTS THEY PROBABLY KNEW AND WHAT WORRIES ME IS I INTERVIEW\nPEOPLE WITHIN ISIS AND A FEW MONTHS AGO A GUY I PROFILED IN\n\"THE DAILY BEAST\" A MEMBER OF THEIR SPY SERVICE, THE STATE\nSECURITY OR THE FBI OF ISIS HAS INFORMANTS PLACED WITHIN ISIS\nINCLUDING IN THE FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE BRANCH WHICH PLANS\nTHESE ATTACKS OVERSEAS. HE TOLD ME IN THE NEXT THREE\nMONTHS OR SO THEY'RE PLANNING SOMETHING IN MINNESOTA.\nSPECIFICALLY GOING BE FROM THE SOMALI, WE CAN'T CONFIRM THIS,\nBUT LOCAL REPORTING IN MINNESOTA SUGGESTS THIS GUY WAS A\n22-YEAR-OLD AND BORN IN KENYA BUT OF SOMALI BACKGROUND.\nI SHARE THIS INFORMATION WITH THE FBI AND THEY SAID, THANKS,\nWE'LL LOOK INTO IT AND NEVER REALLY HEARD BACK FROM THEM.\n>> YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS IN DIFFERENT PHASES.\nI GET THAT IT'S FRUSTRATING FOR PEOPLE.\nEVEN THIS TERRORISM QUESTION. IT'S A VERY STRAIGHT SHOT FOR\nPHILIP MUDD. JULIET, WE DEAL WITH THIS ALL\nTHE TIME AND WE GET IT. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO\nNONINVESTIGATIVE PEOPLE. WHO ELSE PLANTS BOMBS IN RANDOM\nAREAS WHERE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE OTHER THAN SOMEBODY WHO IS UP\nTO NO GOOD AND AFFECT OUR WAY OF LIFE.\nWHY ISN'T THAT ENOUGH? IS THE DISTINCTION BECAUSE\nYOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO INTO COURT AND MAKE A CASE AND IT\nCAN'T BE IT FEELS LIKE SOMETHING?\n>> IT'S ALL OF THE ABOVE. LOOK, NONE OF US ARE QUESTIONING\nTHE TERROR OCCURRED IN PARTICULAR.\nYOU KNOW, ON SATURDAY MORNING, SATURDAY NIGHT AND FEAR OF\nTERROR. THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN A\nPROSECUTOR NEEDING TO MAKE A TERRORISM CASE AND REITERATING\nWHAT WE SAID ALL WEEK. WE DON'T KNOW WHO THE CULPRITS\nARE. A NUMBER OF MOTIVATIONS.\nTHEY MAY SEEM OBVIOUS TO US THAT THIS IS A POLITICALLY MOTIVATED.\nWE TALK ABOUT STAITERROR AND IS AND YOU DON'T WANT INVESTIGATORS\nGOING INTO AN INVESTIGATION ASSUMING TOO MUCH BECAUSE YOU'RE\nGOING TO MISS CLUES. THAT'S WHY YOUR ANALYSTS ARE\nSAYING, LOOK AT THE FACTS. THE FACTS GIVE YOU A LOT AND\nTHEN WE GO FROM THERE. >> PANEL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH\nFOR ALL OF YOUR EXPEER RTEXPERT. WE WILL HAVE NEW INFORMATION AS\nIT DEVELOPS THROUGHOUT THE HOUR.",

HE ATTENDED COLLEGE LOCALLY IN\nSAINT CLOUD AND WORKED AS A PRIVATE SECURITY FORM.\nADAN STABBED NINE PEOPLE BEFORE AN OFF DUTY POLICE OFFICER NAME\nJASON FALCONER SHOT HIM TO DEATH.\nFALCONER IS A FORMER POLICE CHIEF IN ALBANY.\nHE NOW WORKS IN THE NEARBY TOWN OF AVON.\nTHE MINNEAPOLIS STAR TRIBUNE SAYS THIS OFFICER IS A MEDAL\nWINNING MARKSMAN.

WELCOME.\n>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. >> THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.\nDO YOU KNOW THIS SUSPECT? >> I DO NOT KNOW HIM PERSONALLY.\n>> DO YOU KNOW OF HIM? >> WELL, YES, I KNOW HIM THROUGH\nTHE COMMUNITY, WHAT I'M HEARING FROM THE COMMUNITY LEADERS,\nNEIGHBORS FROM THE CITY OF SAINT CLOUD.\nA LOT OF NEIGHBORS KNEW HIM AS A QUIET PERSON, WHO REALLY WAVED\nAT THEM AND DIDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS AT ALL.\n>> AND I ASK YOU THESE QUESTIONS BECAUSE WE OFTEN HEAR, YOU KNOW,\nIN REGARDS TO MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF CRIMES, CRIMES\nCOMMITTED BY MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF PEOPLE, THAT PEOPLE\nKNEW OF THE SUSPECT, BUT THEY NEVER REALLY THOUGHT ANYTHING\nWAS WRONG, AND, AND THEY WERE SURPRISED BY HIS ACTIONS.\nARE YOU SURPRISED? >> I'M VERY SURPRISED.\nAND ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU KNOW SOMEONE THROUGH OTHER PEOPLE\nTHAT THAT PERSON HAD NO TROUBLE COMMUNICATING WITH NEIGHBORS.\nHE WAS VERY NICE PERSON, AS THEY SAID.\nI KNOW THAT HE KNEW OF HIM AS -- SO THROUGH THAT YES I AM\nSURPRISED. ALSO, THERE ARE SOME RUMORS NOW\nIN OUR COMMUNITY OF SOME PEOPLE WHO KNEW HIM AND SAYING PROBABLY\nHE MIGHT HAVE SOME SORT OF A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE.\nALL KIND OF THINGS ARE FLYING AROUND ABOUT HIS IDENTITY.\n>> COMMUNITY LEADERS SAY THEY FEAR BACKLASH.\nCAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT THAT? >> YES.\nREALLY, THERE IS A BIG CONCERN OF BACKLASH.\nWE OFTEN FIND OURSELVES IN THIS KIND OF SITUATION, IN A POSITION\nWHERE WE ARE AS A COMMUNITY GENERALIZED AS A BAD PEOPLE.\nAND THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME.

AND LATER ON WE LEARNED THAT\nTHERE WAS A BIG RECRUITMENT HAPPENING TO OUR YOUNG,\nVULNERABLE MEN, AND THAT FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS WE'VE BEEN\nENGAGED IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND THE BIGGEST SUPPORT OF\nFIGHTING RADICALIZATION IN MY COMMUNITY CAME FROM THE SOMALI\nAMERICAN COMMUNITY. THOSE WHO WERE PAID FOR IT,\nSUPPORTED, AND WERE CONCERNED AND AFRAID FOR THEIR KIDS.\nAND THE REASON BEING IS THIS COMMUNITY IS VERY FOND OF THEIR\nNEW HOME OF AMERICA, AND THEY ARE REALLY VERY BUSY CHASING THE\nAMERICAN DREAM AND TRYING HARD TO RAISE THEIR KIDS WITH\nSUCCESS.

HI, ROSA.\n>> Reporter: GOOD MORNING, CAROL.\nA LOT OF DEVELOPMENTS HERE. LET ME START WITH THE LATEST\nFROM POLICE. THEY, OF COURSE, HAVE BEEN\nINVESTIGATING THIS STABBING SPREE OVER THE WEEKEND ON\nSATURDAY. JUST IMAGINE, POLICE SAY THAT A\nMAN DRESSED IN A PRIVATE SECURITY FIRM UNIFORM ENTERED\nINTO THE MALL AND MADE SOME SORT OF REFERENCE TO ALLAH, ASKED\nSEVERAL PEOPLE IF THEY WERE MUSLIMS AND THEN STARTED\nATTACKING PEOPLE AT THAT MALL WITH A KNIFE.\nNOW, POLICE ARE NOT IDENTIFYING HIM JUST YET, BUT, HOWEVER,\nCOMMUNITY LEADERS HERE IN MINNESOTA WHO ARE IN CONTACT\nWITH THE FAMILY HAVE RELEASED HIS NAME.\nAND AS CAROL MENTIONED, HIS NAME IS DAHIR ADAN.\n22 YEARS OLD. HE WENT TO SCHOOL IN THIS\nCOMMUNITY, HE WORKED IN THIS COMMUNITY FOR A PRIVATE SECURITY\nFIRM. BUT WE HAVE TO ADD THIS, THAT\nAUTHORITIES BELIEVE THAT THIS SITUATION WOULD HAVE BEEN SO\nMUCH WORSE IF IT WASN'T FOR A HERO THAT WAS ON SITE.\nA POLICE OFFICER THAT THEY ARE IDENTIFYING AS JASON FALCONER\nFROM A NEARBY TOWN WHO WAS AT THE MALL WHO RESPONDED QUICKLY.\nACCORDING TO SURVEILLANCE VIDEO, OFFICIALS SAY AFTER WATCHING THE\nSURVEILLANCE VIDEO SAY HE REACTED VERY QUICKLY, EVEN WHEN\nTHE ATTACKER WAS LUNGING AT HIM. HE WENT AHEAD AND TOOK OUT HIS\nWEAPON, FIRED A SHOT AND KILLED THE SUSPECT.\nCAROL? >> ALL RIGHT, ROSA FLORES\nREPORTING LIVE FROM ST. CLOUD, MINNESOTA, THIS MORNING.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH. I WANT TO BRING BACK IN MY\nPANEL, WITH ME KAREN GREENBERG, DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER OF\nNATIONAL SECURITY AT FORDHAM UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL AND A\nTERRORIST ANALYST. A LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINER AND\nFORMER NYPD SERGEANT. WELCOME BACK.\nSO, KAREN, I WANT TO START WITH YOU AND THIS YOUNG MAN IN\nMINNESOTA. WE DON'T KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT\nHIM, BUT THE SOMALI COMMUNITY IN MINNESOTA KNOWS OF THE FAMILY,\nTHE FAMILY IS WELL-KNOWN. >> YEAH.\nI MEAN, THIS IS THE FIRST ATTACK IN THE UNITED STATES THAT A\nSOMALI-AMERICAN HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN.\nTHERE WAS A PLOT YEARS AGO BUT THIS IS THE FIRST ONE.\nSO I THINK THAT IS ALSO A THRESHHOLD.\nTHE SOMALI-AMERICAN COMMUNITY THAT HAS BEEN ATTRACTED TO ISIS\nHAS LARGELY WANTED TO GO ABROAD TO FIGHT EITHER WITH AL-SHABAAB\nOR IN SYRIA. BUT LET MEL THE YOU IN TERMS OF\nWHO THE INDIVIDUALS ARE COMPARED TO THE 110 CASES OF ISIS\nINDIVIDUALS IN THE UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW OVER THE PAST TWO\nYEARS. MOST OF THEM ARE 20, FOR THE\nMOST PART, WHEN APPREHENDED AND ARRESTED.\nBUT THOSE WHO CARRY OUT ATTACKS TEND TO BE OLDER LIKE THE\nINDIVIDUAL THEY ARE LOOKING FOR IN THE NEW YORK AREA RIGHT NOW.\nTHEY TEND TO BE IN THEIR LATE 20s.\nALSO, THE SAN BERNARDINO ATTACK, THE ORLANDO ATTACK, A NUMBER OF\nTHE SERIOUS THREATS TO NEW YORK CITY WERE FROM PEOPLE WHOSE\nBACKGROUND WAS IN AFGHANISTAN. SO THAT REALLY BRINGS IN THE\nLARGER PICTURE OF WHAT ACTUALLY ARE THE DISLOCATING ELEMENTS\nHERE. AND FINALLY, THERE IS OFTEN SOME\nPERSONAL TRAUMA THAT PROCEEDS THESE ATTACKS.\nWHO KNOWS WHAT IT WILL BE. WE HEAR THAT THE INDIVIDUAL\nTHERE IS LOOKING FOR AND WAS IN NEW JERSEY.\n>> THE THING IS WITH THE ATTACK IN MINNESOTA, ISIS CLAIMED\nRESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT. >> ISIS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY\nAFTER THEY HEARD THAT THE NAME OF THE PERSON WAS MUSLIM.\nWHO KNOWS WHAT MEANS FOR THE CALL TO RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT.\nWE DON'T KNOW. AND THEY MAY CLAIM\nRESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS. >> BUT THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY\nMEAN THAT THEY ORDERED IT FROM THESE OTHER COUNTRIES.\n>> OF COURSE NOT. WE HAVE NOT FOUND WITH THE\nEXCEPTION OF SOME INTERNET CASES THAT HAVE CALLED FOR THINGS OVER\nTHE INTERNET THAT HASN'T BEEN REALIZED.\nWE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT KIND OF CONNECTION AS I SEE BEFORE WITH\nAL QAEDA. WHAT IT MEANS TO BE INSPIRED BY\nISIS IN MORE WAYS IS UNSETTLING. IF YOU ARE REALLY FEELING THAT\nYOU'RE MISTREATED AND AREN'T AS SUCCESSFUL AS OTHER INDIVIDUALS,\nHERE'S WHAT YOU CAN DO ANYWHERE ANY TIME.\nBUT IS THAT A DIRECT MISSION OR DIRECT MESSAGE?\nI DON'T THINK SO. >> SO JOE, WE ARE SEPARATING OUT\nTHE MINNESOTA ATTACK BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT CONNECTING THAT TO\nTHE BOMBINGS HERE ON THE EAST COAST, RIGHT?\nSO WHY -- IS IT REALLY A TERROR CELL OR IS IT THESE GROUPS OF\nDISENFRANCHISED YOUNG MEN GETTING TOGETHER TO CAUSE\nTROUBLE? >> WELL, APPARENTLY IT SEEMS TO\nBE GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE HAD A HATRED FOR THE UNITED\nSTATES, A HATRED FOR OUR WAY OF LIFE, AND THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE\nIT TO US WITH THE BOMBS AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF DEVICES THEY\nARE GOING TO USE. I MEAN, WE USED A KNIFE IN THE\nMINNESOTA AREA, THE PRESSURE COOKERS HERE.\nNO GUNS INVOLVED IN THIS, WHICH IS UNUSUAL WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK\nAT IT, BUT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS A TOUGH JOB AHEAD OF IT.\nBECAUSE WE WANT TO GAIN THE VENLS BUT WE HAVE TO DO IT\nWITHIN THE BOUND RIS OF THE CONSTITUTION.\nAND THIS IS WHERE THAT WHOLE SHARE IS THAT WE HAVE A PROBLEM\nWITH. IT IS DIFFICULT TO INVOKE\nTERRORISM BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO I THINK FRINGE RIGHTS AND THAT IS\nWHAT THE PROBLEM IS. >> PUT THIS INTO PERSPECTIVE, IT\nCAUSES ONE TO FREAK OUT TO KNOW THERE WAS AN ATTACK IN\nMINNESOTA, RIGHT? THERE WAS AN ATTACK IN SEASIDE,\nNEW JERSEY. THERE WERE BOMBS FOUND IN\nELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY, AND THEN IN CHELSEA THE TWO PRESSURE\nCOOKER BOMBS. SO IS IT THIS WAVE OF TERRORISM\nROLLING OVER THE COUNTRY. LIKE PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE FOR\nME. IT'S THE WEEK OF 9/11.\nTHIS IS THE WEEK AFTER 9/11 THAT THE ATTACKS OCCURRED IN.\nIF THERE WAS A SENSE OF LET'S DO SOMETHING TO DESTABILIZE PEOPLE,\nTHAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD PICK. TO SEE A WAVE OF TERRORISM AS WE\nHAVE IN THE PAST WOULD BE WITH EXPANDING THAT.\nPEOPLE DID NOT DIE IN NEWS ATTACKS.\nTHE ABILITY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS TO CARRY OUT ATTACKS IN A\nSOPHISTICATED, EFFECTIVE, COORDINATED WAY HAS BEEN\nMINIMIZED. THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE LAW\nENFORCEMENT EFFORTS THAT HAVE VAST.\nAND IT'S ADEPT AT UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE THREAT IS.\nBUT IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF SIMILARITIES ISSUE.\nI THINK THAT IT IS MORPHING. THE MAY NOT BE USING THE WORD\nTERRORIST FOR THIS DOWN THE ROAD.\n>> I HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR STICKING\nAROUND. I DO APPRECIATE IT.\nTHANK YOU FOR JOINING ME.

A WING OF ISIS IS CLAIMING\nSTABBINGS AT A MINNESOTA MALL, CALLING THE MAN HERE, DAHIR\nADAN, A SOLDIER OF THE STATE. BUT AT THIS POINT CNN CANNOT\nCONFIRM SIGS WAS BEHIND THE ATTACK.\nTHEY SAY ADAN WAS IN A SECURITY UNIFORM WHEN HE ENTERED THE\nMALL, SLASHING VICTIMS. SOME OF HIS VICTIMS TRIED TO\nATTACK BACK. >> I WAS FACING HIM HEAD-ON AND\nHE HAD ONE FIST UP AND I KNEW HE WAS GOING TO STRIKE ME SO I\nTRIED TO BRACE MYSELF FOR IT. HE JUST DID ONE FAST MOTION TO\nTHE SIDE OF MY HEAD. I HAD A HAT ON EVERYTHING.\nAND YOU COULD SEE WHERE THE BLADE WENT THROUGH THE HAT.\nPULLED OUT THE BLADE. I FELL TO THE GROUND AND HE JUST\nKEPT PUSHING TO WHATEVER HIS OBJECTIVE WAS.\nHE LOOKED JUST BLANK IN THE EYES, LIKE HE WASN'T EVEN THERE.\n>> DURING THE ATTACK POLICE AND WITNESSES SAY ADAN MADE\nREFERENCES TO ALLA'A AND ASKED AT LEAST ONE PERSON IF HE OR SHE\nWAS MUSLIM BEFORE HE BEGAN STABBING.\nTHIS MAN ALSO WAS SHOT AND KILLED DURING A RAMPAGE BY AN\nOFF-DUTY POLICE OFFICER AT THE MALL.\nLET'S GO TO ROSA FLORES FOLLOWING THE INVESTIGATION FROM\nST. CLOUD, MINNESOTA. THE QUESTION IS, WHY?\nI MEAN, DO YOU KNOW ANY MORE INTO THE MOTIVATION HERE?\n>> Reporter: YOU KNOW, BROOKE, WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO COMMUNITY\nLEADERS HERE WHO HAVE BEEN TALKING TO THE FAMILY WHO IS\nTELLING A LITTLE MORE BUT IS ALSO BEING VERY RESERVED.\nTHE FAMILY TELLS THESE LEADERS THAT ON SATURDAY ADAN WAS\nACTUALLY TRYING TO JUST BUY A CELL PHONE AT THIS MALL.\nSO, YOU'RE RIGHT TO ASK THE QUESTION, WHY?\nHOW DO WE GO FROM AN INDIVIDUAL GOING TO BUY A CELL PHONE TO\nCOMMITTING THIS ACT? WE'RE ALSO LEARNING MORE ABOUT\nHIM, ABOUT ADAN. HE'S 22 YEARS OLD.\nPEOPLE HERE IN THE COMMUNITY TELL US THAT HE WENT TO COLLEGE\nHERE. HE WORKED HERE.\nHE WORKED FOR A PRIVATE SECURITY FIRM HERE.\nAND HE'S PART OF THE SOMALI COMMUNITY.\nNOTICE, HEAR THIS, THESE COMMUNITY LEADERS ARE VERY\nCONCERNED BECAUSE THEY SAY THEY'VE BEEN BUILDING BRIDGES\nFOR 30 YEARS TO TRY TO INTEGRATE THE SOMALI COMMUNITY WITH\nMINNESOTANS AND THEY'RE AFRAID THIS WILL SHATTER ALL OF THEIR\nEFFORTS. TAKE A LISTEN.\n>> WE'VE BEEN A PEACEFUL COMMUNITY.\nWE'VE WORKED VERY HARD TO BUILD BRIDGES.\nTHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANYTHING.\nTHE IDEA THAT PEOPLE LIKE ISIS WILL CLAIM THIS RESPONSIBILITY,\nFOR ME- FOR US, IS RIDICULOUS, BECAUSE ANYTHING -- YOU KNOW,\nTHEY LIKE CLAIMING THINGS. SPECTACULAR ATTACKS OR THINGS\nTHAT HAPPEN. THEY LIKE TO SAY, WE -- BUT\nAGAIN, THE FACTS HAVEN'T BEEN KNOWN YET.\nTHERE'S NO CONNECTION BETWEEN ISIS AND DAHIR.\nONCE THAT CONNECTION IS MADE, WHATEVER IT IS, THEN AS A\nCOMMUNITY WE'RE GOING TO RESPOND.\n>> Reporter: HERE'S THE LATEST FROM THE POLICE CHIEF.\nHE SAYS THAT WHILE WARRANTS HAVE BEEN EXERCISED AND INVESTIGATORS\nARE SIFTING THROUGH ALL OF THE EVIDENCE THEY'VE COLLECTED, THEY\nDO NOT FIND AT THIS MOMENT, BROOKE, ANY CONNECTION TO ISIS.\n>> TELL ME MORE JUST QUICKLY, ROSA, THE HERO OFF-DUTY POLICE\nOFFICER? >> Reporter: YOU KNOW, WE DO\nKNOW MORE ABOUT HIM. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT\nINVESTIGATORS TELL US AND REMIND US ABOUT IS THAT HE IS ALSO A\nVICTIM IN THIS STABBING. HE WAS AT THE MALL.\nHE'S AN OFF-DUTY POLICE OFFICER FROM A NEARBY TOWN CALLED AVON.\nHE JUST HAPPENED TO BE THERE. NOW, HE ALSO HAPPENED TO BE A\nFORMER POLICE CHIEF, FIREARMS INSTRUCTOR AND OFF-DUTY POLICE\nOFFICER ALL THE SAME TIME. HE HAD HIS WEAPON, PULLED OUT\nTHAT WEAPON AND SHOT AND KILLED HIM.\nHE'S BEEN TALKING TO THE GOVERNOR.\nNOT TALKING TO THE MEDIA JUST YET.\nTALKING TO THE GOVERNOR. HE IS OKAY.\nTHEY DO REMIND US THAT HE IS ALSO A VICTIM, NOT JUST A HERO\nIN THIS CASE. >> YES, ROSA, THANK YOU IN\nMINNESOTA.",

THE FBI SAYS HE'S A NATURALIZED\nU.S. CITIZEN BORN IN AFGHANISTAN.\nWE'RE BACK WITH CARSON IN INDIANA.\nHE'S A MEMBER OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE.\nTHERE WAS ANOTHER DISTURBING INCIDENT OVER THE WEEKEND IN ST.\nCLOUD, MINNESOTA, A SHOPPING MALL.\nA 22-YEAR-OLD AMERICAN BORN IN KENYA, DAHIR ADAN, WAS MAKING A\nSECURITY GUARD UNIFORM AND HE SIMPLY WENT ON A RAMPAGE AND\nSTARTED SLASHING PEOPLE SERIOUSLY WITH A KNIFE,\nSCREAMING OUT ALLAH, ASKING PEOPLE IF THEY WERE MUSLIM, AND\nIF THEY SAID NO, HE WOULD GO AHEAD AND CUT THEM AND SLASH\nTHEM. HE WAS LATER SHOT BY AN OFF-DUTY\nPOLICE OFFICER. ALL THESE INCIDENTS, THEY RAISE\nSO MUCH CONCERN AND ANXIETY. WHAT'S YOUR REACTION WHEN YOU\nHEAR THAT? >> WELL, I THINK IT'S VERY\nUNFORTUNATE.

I'M A FORMER POLICE OFFICER AND\nI KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE TO RESPOND TO AN EMERGENCY WHEN\nYOU'RE OFF DUTY SO I COMMEND HIM.\nI THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT THE GROWING MUSLIM COMMUNITY IN THIS\nCOUNTRY, MOST OF US LOVE THIS COUNTRY.\n99.99 LOVE THIS COUNTRY.

YOU HAVE WHITE SUPREMACIST\nGROUPS COMMITTING ACTS OF VIOLENCE REGULAR UNTIL THIS\nCOUNTRY. AND YOU HAVE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS\nWHO USE REALLY JUST LANGUAGE, BE IT CHRISTIANITY OR ANY OTHER\nFAITH, AND THEY SUPPORT RADICAL ACTS.\nSO IT'S UNFORTUNATE TO SAY THAT THIS REPRESENTS ISLAM BECAUSE IT\nDOES NOT. I COMMEND THE ADMINISTRATION FOR\nTHEIR CVE EFFORTS. I'LL SAY IT AGAIN AND AGAIN,\nCOUNTER AND VIOLENT EXTREMISM, THOSE EFFORTS ARE VERY\nIMPORTANT.

HIS NAME IS AHMAD KHAN RAHAMI.\nHE COULD BE ARMED AND DANGEROUS, AND IS WANTED FOR QUESTIONING.\nTHIS AS ANOTHER BOMB EXPLODES OVERNIGHT IN NEW JERSEY.\n>> THAT WAS DETONATED BY ROBOT. THAT BLAST AT A NEW JERSEY TRAIN\nSTATION. FIVE PIPE BOMBS WERE FOUND IN\nTOTAL AND ALL MORNING LONG, POLICE, FBI, ATF HAVE BEEN\nRAIDING AN APARTMENT ATOP A RESTAURANT A FEW MILES AWAY.\nIT'S UNCLEAR WHAT IF ANY CONNECTION THAT BOMB HAS TO THAT\nTHE NEW YORK BLAST. THERE WAS ANOTHER DETONATION IN\nTHE BRONX ON PURPOSE TO FIND OUT ABOUT THE SECOND BOMB THAT DID\nNOT GO OFF. THEY HAD TO BLOW THAT ONE UP AS\nWELL. >> THAT'S NOT THE ONLY ATTACK\nBEING INVESTIGATED RIGHT NOW. ISIS TAKING CREDIT FOR A\nSTABBING THAT HAPPENED ON A MINNESOTA MALL ON SATURDAY.\n>> THIS AS WE LEARN THE 22-YEAR-OLD SLASHER IN THAT CASE\nWAS BORN IN SOMALIA. HAS BEEN HERE FOR 15 YEARS.\nWAS SHOUTING ALLAH WHILE ASKING HIS VICTIMS INSIDE THE MALL IF\nTHEY WERE MUSLIM. JOINING US LIVE WITH THE LATEST\nON THE INVESTIGATION IS POLICE CHIEF WILLIAM MAYOR ALONG WITH\nMAYOR, DAVID CLIES. THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.\n>> GOOD MORNING. >> WHAT'S THE LATEST\nINFORMATION? NEW INFORMATION FOR OUR\nAUDIENCE. >> NOTHING NEW AT THIS\nPARTICULAR TIME. OF COURSE, OUR INVESTIGATION\nCONTINUES AND WE'RE TRYING TO LEARN AS MUCH ABOUT THE SUSPECT\nAS POSSIBLE. WE'RE WORKING IN CON JUNCTION\nWITH THE FBI AND WE'RE WORKING WITH THE MEDICAL EXAMINER AND\nTHERE ARE A LOT OF MOVING PARTS RIGHT NOW BUT OUR INVESTIGATION\nCONTINUES. >> MR. MAYOR, WE KNOW HE'S A\n22-YEAR-OLD SOMALI. CAME HERE AS A YOUNG KID.\nISIS IS TAKING CREDIT FOR HIM. SAYS HE'S ONE OF OUR SOLDIERS.\nWHAT COULD YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT?\n>> I CAN TELL YOU THERE'S NO JUSTIFICATION FOR THE EVIL THAT\nWAS THE INTENTION OF THIS INDIVIDUAL AND IF NOT FOR THE\nBRAVERY OF AN OFF DUTY POLICE OFFICER, HE COULD HAVE HAD\nADDITIONAL VICTIMS AND POTENTIALLY LOSS OF LIFE FOR\nTHOSE, BUT FORTUNATELY THE OFFICER WAS ABLE TO TAKE HIM\nDOWN AND PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING.\nWE'LL ALLOW THE INVESTIGATION TO TAKE PLACE, BUT CLEARLY HE HAD\nAN EVIL INTENT AND HE WAS TAKEN DOWN BY SOMEBODY THAT HAPPENED\nTO BE AT THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME.\n>> HE WAS AT THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME, MAYOR.\nOFTENTIMES WE HEAR PEOPLE SAY YOU GOT TO TAKE GUNS AWAY FROM\nPEOPLE. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE INSTANCES\nWHERE THERE COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT MORE PEOPLE HURT HAD THIS\nOFF DUTY POLICE OFFICER NOT BEEN THERE WITH HIS GUN WHICH HE KNEW\nHOW TO USE AND TAKE CARE OF THE GUY.\n>> THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE. I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THE\nVIDEOTAPE THAT WAS OF HIS TAKING DOWN THE SUSPECT AND CLEARLY TO\nME, IT WAS LIKE A TRAINING VIDEO FOR POLICE.\nTHE ATTACKER CAME -- LUNGED AT HIM THREE SEPARATE TIMES.\nTHE FIRST TIME HE ACTUALLY IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS A POLICE\nOFFICER. TOLD HIM TO GO DOWN.\nAS HE WENT DOWN, HE LUNGED FORWARD AND LESS THAN A SECOND,\nWENT 20 FEET, IF NOT FOR THE OFFICER'S ACTION, THE OFFICER'S\nLIFE CERTAINLY WAS IN DANGER, BUT THE ENDANGERMENT OF THE REST\nOF THE PEOPLE IN THAT MALL WAS CLEARLY THERE IF NOT FOR HIS\nSWIFT ACTION. >> THAT WAS OFF DUTY POLICE\nOFFICER JASON FALCONER AND HE HAD A GUN.\nDO YOU BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING SOMETHING MORE ESPECIALLY\nWITH THE MAULS YOU GUY HAVE IN YOUR REGION BY PUTTING ARMED\nOFFICERS IN THERE? >> WELL, WE'VE ACTUALLY\nINCREASED SECURITY PRESENCE TODAY.\nTHE MALL WILL OPEN UP TODAY. WE'LL HAVE OFFICERS IN THE MALL.\nADDITIONAL SECURITY WILL BE OUT TALKING.\nIT'S A SITUATION NOT ONLY FOR THE VICTIMS THAT WERE ACTUALLY\nATTACKED BUT PEOPLE WHO WORK AT THE MALL, PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE,\nYOUNG CHILDREN THAT HAD TO WITNESS THIS HORRIFIC ACT, SO\nWE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE\nTHERE, AND WE'LL HAVE ADDITIONAL PRESENCE THERE IN THE MALL TODAY\nFROM OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT. >> GOOD.\nDONALD TRUMP RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, HE WAS ON OUR\nPROGRAM, GUYS, JUST ABOUT AN HOUR AGO, AND WE WERE TALKING\nABOUT THE STABBING AT THE MALL. HE HAD THIS TO SAY.\nLISTEN TO THIS. THE GUY IN MINNESOTA IS GOING\nAROUND, SCREAMING HIS WORDS, SLASHING PEOPLE, KNIFING PEOPLE,\nVICIOUSLY SLASHING PEOPLE. IT'S CRAZY HOW THEY CAME INTO\nTHE COUNTRY IN THE FIRST PLACE IS BEYOND BELIEF.\nTHEY ARE HERE. I'VE BEEN SAYING THIS IS GOING\nTO BE LIKE THE TROJAN HORSE. WE'RE LETTING TENS OF THOUSANDS\nOF PEOPLE FLOW INTO THIS COUNTRY AND THEY ARE BRINGING IN IN MANY\nCASES THIS IS CANCER FROM WITHIN.\nTHIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE SO TOUGH AND YOU KNOW THEY\nSTAY TOGETHER, SO NOBODY REALLY KNOWS WHO IT IS, WHAT'S\nHAPPENING. THEY ARE PLOTTING.\n>> SO CHIEF, AS YOU LISTEN TO DONALD TRUMP TALKING ABOUT, OF\nCOURSE, HE WOULD LIKE EXTREME VETTING GOING FORWARD.\nI KNOW THERE ARE CLOSE TO 6,000 SOMALIS WHO LIVE IN THE SAINT\nCLOUD AREA. DO YOU SHARE HIS CONCERN ABOUT\nWHO IS COMING INTO THE COUNTRY? >> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, MY JOB IS\nPUBLIC SAFETY. IT'S NOT IMMIGRATION POLICY.\nI CAN TELL YOU THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF ALL OF OUR CITIZENS,\nNO MATTER THEIR ETHNICITY ARE FINE, HARD WORKING PEOPLE AND\nNOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR US TO BE DIVISIVE.\nWE ALREADY HAVE A VERY COHESIVE COMMUNITY AND I EXPECT THAT THIS\nWILL DRAW US EVEN CLOSER TOGETHER, BUT AT THE END OF THE\nDAY, OUR JOB IS PUBLIC SAFETY, PERIOD.\n>> CHIEF, HOW DO YOU WORK WITH THE SOMALIAN COMMUNITY THERE?\nDO YOU STAY IN TOUCH WITH THE IMAMs, SINCE 2007 MORE THAN\n202,000 MEN WHO -- 2,000 MEN HAVE LEFT MINNESOTA TO FIGHT\nWITH THE ISLAMIC STATE IN IRAN? HOW DO YOU FIGHT THIS?\nIT'S A MENTALITY THAT THEY ARE LEARNING BEHIND CLOSED DOORS.\n>> WE ACTUALLY WORK VERY WELL. NOT JUST WITH OUR EAST AFRICAN\nCOMMUNITIES BUT ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES.\nYOU KNOW, WE MEET REGULARLY WITH ANY NUMBER OF PEOPLE, WHETHER\nTHEY ARE ADVOCATES FOR SPECIFIC ETHNICITY OR DIFFERENT CAUSE.\nIT'S ONE OF THINGS THAT MAKES SAINT CLOUD A WONDERFUL PLACE TO\nLIVE AND I KNOW THAT MIGHT SOUND CORNY, BUT IT'S THE TRUTH.\nWE HAVE ESTABLISHED AND MAINTAINED A VERY GOOD RAPPORT\nWITH OUR EAST AFRICAN COMMUNITY AND OUR COMMUNITY AT LARGE.\n>> ALL RIGHT. CHIEF, MAYOR, THANK YOU VERY\nMUCH. WE KNOW YOU GOT A BUSY DAY.\nTHANKS FOR STOPPING BY AND TELLING US YOUR STORY.\n>> THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU.\nYOU BET.",

OUR CNN INVESTIGATIVE PRODUCER\nHAS BEEN WORKING THE SCENE NOW EVER SINCE THE STORY BROKE AND\nYOU'RE STILL TALKING WITH SOURCES.\nWHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THIS TRAFFIC STOP AND WHAT PERHAPS\nWERE THEIR SUSPICIONS? >> WE FIRST LEARNED OF THIS\nMAYBE AROUND AN HOUR OR SO AGO. A LOCAL STATE SENATOR HAD\nTWEETED THAT SOME -- ABOUT FIVE PEOPLE WERE QUESTIONED BY THE\nFBI. THEY WERE TAKEN INTO CUSTODY AND\nTHE FBI, THE ONLY THING THAT WE'RE CONFIRMING AT THIS HOUR IS\nTHAT THEY DID, IN FACT, STOP A CAR.\nTHEY WANTED TO QUESTION, THEY DID PULL THEM OVER AND THEY DID\nQUESTION THEM. WE BELIEVE THEY HAVE BEEN TAKEN\nBACK TO THE FBI OFFICES AND THE FBI STRESSED TO US THAT YES\nWHILE IT IS RELATED TO THE EXPLOSION THAT OCCURRED HERE IN\nMANHATTAN THE MEN HAVE NOT BEEN CHARGED AND NO ONE HAS BEEN\nARRESTED. >> WHILE YOU WERE TALKING WE\nWERE SHOWING VIDEO OF POLICE SURROUNDING A CAR THAT HAD BEEN\nROPED OFF WITH POLICE TAPE. THAT'S NOT THE CAR THEY PULLED\nOVER, RIGHT? THEY'RE INVESTIGATING A CAR THEY\nFOUND PARKED SOMEWHERE IN MANHATTAN.\n>> YEAH.

SO WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE\nRELATIONSHIP IS TO THE CAR AND THE CRIME SCENE.\nAND THEY FELT LIKE THEY NEEDED TO TAKE IT BACK TO EXAMINE IT\nFURTHER BUT BESIDES THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY FURTHER\nINFORMATION. >> DO WE KNOW IF THERE'S STILL\nROADS SHUTDOWN IN THIS AREA? CLOSED OFF?\nWE'RE ABOUT TO HIT A MONDAY HORNG IN NEW YORK CITY.\n>> I THINK WE EXPECT ALL THE ROADS TO BE OPEN BY TOMORROW\nMORNING OR BY THE MORNING I SHOULD SAY.\nTRAFFIC IS SLOWLY BEING REOPENED AND LIFE IS, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE\nTRYING TO SORT OF RESTORE LIFE BACK IN THIS COMMUNITY AND LET\nPEOPLE GET BACK INTO THEIR HOMES AND LIVE THEIR LIVES.\nSORT OF I GUESS RESTORE SOME KIND OF NORMALCY BUT EVERYTHING\nSHOULD BE REOPENED BY TOMORROW. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT LAW\nENFORCEMENT IS GOING TO LEAVE THE AREA.\nTHEY'RE STILL TALKING TO THEM INSIDE THE BUILDING.\nI THINK LAW ENFORCEMENT IS GOING TO REMAIN THERE BUT IT'S A\nQUESTION OF HOW MUCH LONGER BUT I THINK THE STREETS WILL ALL BE\nREOPENED BY TOMORROW. >> ONE OF OUR EXPERTS SAID\nPERHAPS THEY'RE NOT RELEASING THIS VIDEO BECAUSE THEY HAVE\nENOUGH TO GO ON RIGHT NOW.

ON THE U.S. EAST\nCOAST. WE CONTINUE FOLLOWING THE\nBREAKING NEWS FROM SATURDAY NIGHT'S BOMBING IN NEW YORK.\nTHE FBI AND NEW YORK POLICE MADE A TRAFFIC STOP SUNDAY NIGHT IN\nTHIS INVESTIGATION. AND WE'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT\nANOTHER SITUATION PLAYING OUT RIGHT NOW IN NEW JERSEY.\nLET'S GO LIVE TO OUR CNN CORRESPONDENT DEBORAH FEYERICK\nFOLLOWING DEVELOPMENTS IN NEW YORK.\nDEBORAH, IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.\nWHAT MORE HAVE YOU LEARNED. >> THERE ARE A COUPLE OF\nINCIDENTS HAPPENING ACROSS BOTH MANHATTAN AND NEW JERSEY.\nWE'RE TOLD NOW THAT THE MAYOR OF ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY TWEETED\nTHAT FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS ARE ON SCENE OF A\nSUSPICIOUS PACKAGE AT A TRAIN STATION IN ELIZABETH, NEW\nJERSEY. RIGHT NOW THEY'RE SAYING THERE\nIS NO THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY AS THE PACKAGE IS SECURED AND ALSO\nINVESTIGATED. ANOTHER INCIDENT ALSO HAPPENING\nNEAR THE NORTHEAST CORRIDOR AND NORTH JERSEY COASTLINE RAIL\nSERVICE. THAT HAS BEEN SUSPENDED BETWEEN\nNEW YORK AND LIBERTY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT AND\nELIZABETH STATIONS BECAUSE POLICE ACTIVITY IN THE ELIZABETH\nAREA. WHENEVER YOU HAVE INCIDENTS LIKE\nWHAT HAPPENED IN NEW YORK CITY AND ALSO IN NEW JERSEY,\nOBVIOUSLY EVERYBODY GETS ON THE HEIGHTENED STATE OF ALERT.\nSO THEY TAKE ALL CALLS SERIOUSLY.\nTHE ISSUE THAT HAPPENED EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON AT A BRIDGE\nCONNECTING STATEN ISLAND AND NEW YORK, THAT THE FBI PUT OUT A\nSTATEMENT SAYING IT WAS CONNECTED TO WHAT HAPPENED IN\nMANHATTAN. BUT THE OTHERS SEEM TO BE\nSEPARATE THERE IS NOTHING LINKING THEM TO ANY OF THE\nINCIDENTS THAT HAPPENED. BUT IT'S ALL VERY EARLY.\nTHIS IS ALL PART OF A LARGER INVESTIGATION.\nAND SO YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF AUTHORITIES PAYING VERY CLOSE\nATTENTION TO ANY POTENTIAL CALL THAT IS MADE.\nBUT THEY'RE ALSO DOING A LOT OF INVESTIGATIVE WORK.\nAND SOME OF THIS INVESTIGATIVE WORK MAY BE LEADING TO TIPS THAT\nARE CAUSING THEM TO TAKE ACTION AND LOOK MORE CLOSELY AT WHAT\nWOULD ORDINARILY BE FOR EXAMPLE NORMAL VEHICLES.\n>> JUST LIKE WHAT WE SAW. JUST 24 HOURS AGO WHEN WE WERE\nCOVERING THE EXPLOSION AND THEN THE PRESSURE COOKER THAT WAS\nDISCOVERED. AND THEN INVESTIGATORS THOUGHT\nTHAT THERE WAS A THIRD DEVICE, THAT'S JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE ON\nTHAT HEIGHTENED ALERT, SWEEPING THE STREETS OF LOWER MANHATTAN.\nBUT IT TURNED OUT TO BE JUST GARBAGE.\nBUT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR EVERYTHING AS YOU RIGHTLY POINT\nOUT. WHAT ELSE CAN YOU TELL US ALSO,\nDEB, ABOUT THIS TRAFFIC STOP THAT INVESTIGATORS HAVE MADE?\n>> WELL, WHAT WE CAN TELL YOU IS THAT THIS TRAFFIC STOP, IT\nHAPPENED AT ABOUT 8:45 THIS EVENING.\nTHE FBI AND NYPD CONDUCTED WHAT THEY CALL A STOP OF A VEHICLE OF\nINTEREST TO THE INVESTIGATION INTO SATURDAY'S BOMBING IN\nMANHATTAN. BUT THEY'RE NOT TELLING --\nTHEY'RE NOT GIVING ANY OTHER SPECIFICS.\nTHERE IS NO INDICATION, FOR EXAMPLE.\nAND THERE IS REASON FOR THIS. THE HEAD OF THE FBI HERE IN NEW\nYORK SAID THEY'RE REALLY FOCUSED ON OPERATIONAL SECURITY.\nTHEY'RE MAKING SURE THAT NOTHING LEAKS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY\nCOMPROMISE THIS INVESTIGATION. IN ANY SERIOUS WAY.\nTHERE HAS ALREADY BEEN SOME INFORMATION THAT HAS BEEN\nRELEASED THAT IS A CAUSE OF CONCERN OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE THERE\nARE PEOPLE WHO ARE AT LARGE. THERE IS CERTAINLY ONE PERSON\nWHO IS AT LARGE, POSSIBLY MORE. AND YOU NEVER WANT TO GIVE\nANYONE THE HEADS UP AS TO WHAT IT IS INVESTIGATORS ARE\nDISCOVERING. BUT THEY DID RELEASE A PICTURE\nOF THAT PRESSURE COOKER. ON THAT PRESSURE COOKER THERE\nWAS A CELL PHONE. SO OBVIOUSLY IF YOU'VE GOT A\nCELL PHONE, YOU WANT TO SEE IF ANYBODY CALLED THAT CELL PHONE,\nPOSSIBLY, TO DETONATE THE DEVICE.\nAND IF SO, OFFICIALS CAN TRIANGULATE ONE PHONE TO THE\nOTHER AND GET SOME GOOD INFORMATION, SOME GOOD\nINTELLIGENCE. AGAIN, EVERYTHING IS BEING\nLOOKED AT. BUT THEY'RE REALLY TRYING TO BE\nVERY CAREFUL. YOU CAN SEE THE DEVICE THERE.\nTHAT'S THE ONE THAT DID NOT EXPLODE.\nAND GEORGE, LET ME TELL YOU, THE NYPD BOMB SQUAD, THEY WERE ABLE\nTO RENDER THAT SAFE THIS AFTERNOON.\nSO NOW THAT IS IN QUANTICO. IT'S GOING TO BE ANALYZED VERY,\nVERY CLOSELY. BECAUSE THERE MIGHT BE SOME SORT\nOF DNA ON THAT DEVICE. MAYBE A FINGERPRINT.\nIT MAY BE A HAIR. IT MAY BE SOMETHING THAT WILL\nGIVE INFORMATION AS TO WHO MADE THAT DEVICE.\nAND IF THAT PERSON IS IN A SYSTEM, SOME SORT OF A\nGOVERNMENT DATABASE, THAT CAN BE VERY HELPFUL INFORMATION.\nBUT THEY'RE LOOKING AT IT VERY CLOSELY.\n>> DEB, AND YOU SET ME UP FOR THE NEXT THING.\nI WANT TO TALK TO OUR GUEST ABOUT IT.\nBUT THE SIMPLE FACT THAT WHEN PEOPLE SET THESE DEVICES OUT,\nYOU KNOW, A LOT OF TIMES THEY'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT\nYES, FINGERPRINTS ARE LEFT OVER, ESPECIALLY IF THAT DEVICE\nDOESN'T DETONATE. DEBORAH FEYERICK LIVE FOR US IN\nNEW YORK, WE'LL STAY IN TOUCH WITH US THROUGH THE NIGHT AS YOU\nCONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE WORK OF THESE INVESTIGATORS.\nLET'S NOW BRING IN OUR STEVE MOORE, CONTRIBUTING WITH US.\nLAW ENFORCEMENT CONTRIBUTOR. HE IS A RETIRED SUPERVISORY\nSPECIAL AGENT WITH THE FBI LIVE VIA SKYPE IN LOS ANGELES.\nI WANT TO TALK THAN. AND I HEARD YOU SPEAKING WITH MY\nCOLLEAGUE NATALIE ALLEN EARLIER ABOUT IT.\nBUT THE SIMPLE FACT THAT THEY HAVE THIS DEVICE THAT DID NOT\nDETONATE. AND NOW INVESTIGATORS WILL BE\nABLE TO GLEAN SOME INFORMATION FROM IT, STEVE.\n>> YES, THEY WILL. WHEN YOU'RE PUTTING A BOMB TO OR\nAN IED TOGETHER, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SPEND A LOT OF PRIME\nMINISTER WORRYING WHETHER YOU LEAVE FINGERPRINTS ON IT, OR\nWHETHER YOU HAVE TOUCHED THE PHONE THAT YOU'RE TAPING TO THE\nDEVICE BECAUSE YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO BE BLOWN INTO\nITTY-BITTY LITTLE PIECES. AND WHEN IT'S NOT, THAT\nINFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE TO THE FBI AND NEW YORK JOINT\nTERRORISM TASK FORCE. THE OTHER THING IS IT'S GOT A\nCELL PHONE ON IT. AND IF THAT CELL PHONE WAS ON\nAND PART OF THE SYSTEM, MEANING THAT IT WAS PINGING CELLS, YOU\nCOULD TRACK IT BACK FOR TWO WEEKS AND FIND OUT WHERE IT\nSPENDS ITS NIGHTS. SO THAT CELL PHONE IS A GOLD\nMINE. >> ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE\nFACT THAT -- AND AGAIN, THIS IS UNRELATED.\nBUT THESE OFFICERS, THESE INVESTIGATORS HAVE FOUND A\nSITUATION IN NEW JERSEY THAT THEY'RE LOOKING INTO.\nWHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT? WE UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'RE\nLOOKING FOR EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW.\nTHIS HEIGHTENED SENSE OF ALERT. >> WELL, WE WON'T KNOW OBVIOUSLY\nFOR A LITTLE WHILE, GEORGE. AND YOU'RE RIGHT TO ASK THE\nQUESTION. IT COULD BE JUST AN ABUNDANCE OF\nCAUTION. THIS LOOKS SUSPICIOUS.\nAND WE SHOULD BE CHECKING THESE THINGS OUT.\nBUT I DON'T KNOW RIGHT NOW WHETHER I WOULD PUT MUCH\nCREDENCE IN IT. I THINK THIS GROUP WANTED TO\nATTACK NEW YORK. IT'S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE.\nI MEAN, THEY HIT NEW JERSEY, I BELIEVE, BEFORE THE MARINE CORPS\nCHARITY RUN. SO IT COULD BE SOMETHING.\nI WOULDN'T PUT A LOT OF STOCK IN IT RIGHT NOW.\n>> I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS TRAFFIC STOP.\nPOINTING OUT TO VIEWERS NO ONE HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH ANYTHING.\nBUT THIS TRAFFIC STOP THAT HAS BEEN MADE IN CONNECTION WITH\nWHAT HAPPENED IN NEW YORK. OBVIOUSLY, AS YOU POINTED OUT.\nINVESTIGATORS CAN DETERMINE FINGERPRINT INFORMATION FROM,\nYOU KNOW, THINGS THAT DIDN'T DETONATE, THINGS THAT WERE LEFT\nOVER. SO TELL US WHERE WE ARE WITH\nTHAT. >> WELL, THE FBI DOESN'T PATROL.\nTHE JOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCE ISN'T OUT LOOKING FOR PEOPLE\nRANDOMLY. THAT WAS A TARGETED TRAFFIC\nSTOP. AND THE FACT THAT THEY DID IT ON\nA BRIDGE IS INTERESTING TO ME. THAT LOWERS THE RISK OF ANYBODY\nGETTING OUT AND RUNNING BECAUSE THERE IS NOT VERY FAR TO RUN.\nSO I THINK IT WAS CALCULATED. I THINK THE STOP ON THE BRIDGE\nWAS CALCULATED. BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO\nTHAT BECAUSE IT'S -- UNLESS YOU HAVE TO BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO\nJAM TRAFFIC UP. AND THAT'S NOT A GOOD THING.\nTHE FACT THAT THEY -- THE PEOPLE IN THE CAR, THERE WERE FIVE IN\nTHE CAR. THAT'S INTERESTING.\nAND NOW THEY'RE ALL AT FBI HEADQUARTERS.\nTHAT'S INTERESTING TOO. THEY MAY NOT BE UNDER ARREST.\nTHEY MAY NOT EVEN BE UNDER INVESTIGATIVE DETENTION.\nBUT THEY ARE BEING QUESTIONED. >> I WANT YOU TO HELP ME TO\nSQUARE THE CIRCLE. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ASKING THIS\nQUESTION THERE IS CONFUSION ABOUT THE SIMPLE WORD TERRORISM.\nWE KNOW THE GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK HAS COME OUT TO SAY THAT THIS IS\nTERRORISM. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THE MAYOR\nHAS INDICATED THAT THERE IS NO NEXUS TO INTERNATIONAL\nTERRORISM. AT THE SAME TIME THE CITY, NOT\nLOOKING AT THIS AS TERRORISM. >> THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION,\nGEORGE. AND I BELIEVE THE FACT THAT THE\nJOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCE IS STILL WORKING ON IT.\nPROBABLY INDICATE WHERE THIS IS GOING TO GO.\nHOWEVER, YOU'RE CORRECT. THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT KINDS\nOF TERRORISM. YOU COULD HAVE A DOMESTIC\nTERRORIST. YOU COULD HAVE SOMEBODY WHO IS A\nWHITE SUPREMACIST. YOU COULD HAVE SOME INDEPENDENCE\nGROUP FROM PUERTO RICO. I MEAN, I'M NOT SAYING THAT\nTHAT'S LIKELY. BUT THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT\nTYPES OF TERRORISM. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO MEAN ISLAMIC\nTERRORISM. ISIS, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.\n>> STEVE MOORE LIVE FOR US IN LOS ANGELES.\nSTEVE, WE APPRECIATE YOUR INSIGHT.\nWE'LL STAY IN TOUCH WITH YOU. I'M SURE PLENTY OF QUESTIONS\nAHEAD AS WE SEAL TO BE STARTING A BUSY NIGHT WITH INVESTIGATORS\nON THE JOB.",

THE FBI SAID IT MADE A TRAFFIC\nSTOP WITH POLICE ON SUNDAY OF A VEHICLE OF INTEREST IN THE CASE.\nAS OF NOW WE'RE TOLD THERE ARE NO ARRESTS, NO CHARGES AND THE\nINVESTIGATION IS ON GOING. >> THERE MAY BE ANOTHER CLUE AS\nWELL TO TALK ABOUT.

IT DID NOT EXPLODE AND THEY TOOK\nIT APART. WE'RE ALSO FOLLOWING A SEPARATE\nDEVELOPMENT NOW IN NEW JERSEY. POLICE DETONATED THIS RIGHT\nHERE, IT'S STILL NEW YORK CITY BUT WE'LL GET TO THE NEW JERSEY\nVIDEO IN A MOLT. DETONATED A SUSPICIOUS DEVICE\nFOUND IN A WASTE PASS KET. IT WAS ONE OF UP TO FIVE DEVICES\nDISCOVERED IN A BACKPACK AND THE MEN THAT FOUND IT SAW WIRES AND\nA PIPE AND CONTACTED AUTHORITIES.\nTHE STATE POLICE ARE INVESTIGATING AND I BELIEVE THEY\nWERE FOUND NEAR A TRAIN STATION? >> NEAR A TRAIN STATION AND\nTRAIN SERVICE HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE.\nIT'S THAT OLD SAYING SEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING.\n>> THEY'RE ALERT RIGHT NOW. INVESTIGATORS THEY ARE ON HIGH\nALERT LOOKING FOR ANYTHING AND CERTAINLY OUR CORR ADDRESS\nSPONTANEOUS DENS WE ARE OUT IN FULL FORCE.\nFOLLOWING THE DEVELOPMENTS IN NEW YORK.\nALSO RACHEL CRANE IS IN ELIZABETH NEW JERSEY WITH MORE\nON THAT SUSPICIOUS PACKAGE THAT WAS FOUND.\nLET'S GO TO RACHEL FIRST. >> WELL, GEORGE, WE'RE HERE IN\nHE ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY. WE JUST SPOKE TO THE MAYOR ABOUT\nTHIS ON GOING SITUATION. HE DESCRIBED WHAT HAPPENED HERE\nTHIS EVENING. HE SAID THAT TWO GENTLEMEN SAW A\nBACKPACK IN A TRASH CAN VERY CLOSE TO A LOCAL PUB AND ALSO\nVERY CLOSE TO THE TRAIN STATION HERE.\nTHEY OPENED THE BACKPACK THINKING THEY WOULD FIND\nSOMETHING VALUABLE AND INSTEAD THEY FOUND A VERY SUSPICIOUS\nLOOKING DEVICE WITH WIRES COMING OUT OF IT.\nTHAT'S WHEN THEY DROPPED THAT BACKPACK AND WENT AROUND THE\nCORNER TO THE LOCAL POLICE STATION.\nTHE LOCAL AUTHORITIES RESPONDED AND THAT'S WHEN THEY ALSO\nCONFIRMED THAT PACKAGE WAS SUSPICIOUS LOOKING.\nAS YOU CAN SEE THIS WAS OBVIOUSLY STILL AN ON GOING\nSITUATION. THAT'S WHEN THEY ALSO THEN THE\nLOCAL AUTHORITIES CALLED IN THE BOMB SQUAD AS WELL AS THE FBI.\nNOW THE MAYOR ALSO TOLD US THAT THAT BACKPACK, THE DEVICES\nINSIDE UP TO FIVE DEVICES BUT ALSO DESCRIBED TO US WHEN ONE OF\nTHE ROBOTS ACCIDENTALLY DETONATED ONE.\nTAKE A LISTEN. >> THE ROBOTS THAT WERE GOING IN\nTO DISARL IT CUT A WIRE AND IT EXPLODED.\nAND I KNOW THERE'S OTHER DEVICES.\nI DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR MADE UP OF BUT THEY'LL HAVE TO BE\nREMOVED. ALL THE FRAGMENTS IN THE OTHER\nPIECE HAVE TO BE PICKED UP SO THE FBI CAN INVESTIGATE THIS\nFULLY. >> THEY WENT ON TO SAY THERE'S\nNO TIMER AND NO CELL PHONE CONNECTED TO THOSE DEVICES.\nNOW THE AREA HERE, THE STREETS HAVE ALL BEEN CLOSED DOWN.\nTRAIN SERVICE HAS BEEN SUSPENDED BETWEEN NEW YORK HIBERTY AIRPORT\nAND ELIZABETH NEW JERSEY. UNCLEAR WHEN IT WILL BE RESTORED\nBUT CERTAINLY EVERYBODY HERE IN HE ELIZABETH NEW JERSEY, ALL THE\nLOCAL AUTHORITIES RESPONDING TO THE SITUATION AND ON HEIGHTENED\nALERT. >> YEAH AND IT'S ABOUT TO BE A\nMONDAY MORNING COMMUTER TIME SO THIS IS ANOTHER DISRUPTION.\nHOW FAR IS ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY FROM MANHATTAN?\n>> IT TOOK US ABOUT 30 MINUTES TO GET HERE NATALIE THIS\nEVENING. THAT OBVIOUSLY WITH NO TRAFFIC.\nSO IT'S NOT TOO FAR BUT IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT A STONE'S THROW\nAWAY. >> OKAY.\nRACHEL CRANE FOR US THERE. OBVIOUSLY VERY ACTIVE SCENE AT\nTHE INVESTIGATION WITH THE FIRE TRUCK GOING RIGHT PAST HER AS\nSHE SPOKE. >> ALSO IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT\nTHAT SITUATION IN NEW JERSEY NOT BEING CONNECTED AT THIS POINT TO\nTHE SITUATION IN MANHATTAN AND THAT'S WHERE WE WANT TO GO NOW\nLIVE TO DEBORAH FOLLOWING THE INVESTIGATION IN NEW YORK.\nDEBORAH, SO, YOU KNOW, TALK TO US, IF YOU COULD ABOUT THE\nLATEST, WE UNDERSTAND THIS TRAFFIC STOP WAS MADE ON A\nBRIDGE THAT HAS BEEN CONNECTED TO THE BOMBING INCIDENT.\nTHE EXPLOSION. >> WELL THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.\nIT'S UNCLEAR WHAT SPECIFICALLY LEAD INVESTIGATORS BOTH FROM THE\nFBI AND THE NYPD TO MAKE THIS PARTICULAR TRAFFIC STOP BUT THEY\nWERE STOPPED ON THE BRIDGE AND THAT BRIDGE CONNECTS STATEN\nISLAND WITH BROOKLYN BUT IF YOU GO IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION YOU\nCAN GET TO NEW JERSEY. SO THERE'S LINKS BETWEEN THE\nDIFFERENT AREAS WHERE THESE DEVICES SEEM TO BE SHOWING UP\nAND YOU GOT LAW ENFORCEMENT, HUNDREDS OF MEN AND WOMEN WHO\nARE REALLY THINKING ABOUT WHAT THESE DEVICES ARE AND HOW THEY\nCOULD POTENTIALLY BE CONNECTED AND THIS IS ALL PUT OF THE\nINVESTIGATION. WE CAN TELL YOU YOURS IS IN\nTOTALITY. YOU HAD THREE DEVICES FOUND\nYESTERDAY, SATURDAY. TWO IN MANHATTAN.\nONE IN NEW JERSEY. ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF FROM\nTHE LOCATION OF THE OTHER DEVICES BUT NOW YOU GOT THESE IN\nELIZABETH NEW JERSEY AND JUST TO PUT IT IN CONTEXT, HE LIZ PELTH,\nNEW JERSEY IS ABOUT FIVE MILES FROM NEWARK AIRPORT AND THAT'S\nWHY YOU HAVE THAT STRETCH FROM ELIZABETH TO NEWARK CLOSE DOWN\nRIGHT NOW BUT THEY'RE LOOKING AT ALL OF THIS TO SEE WHETHER\nTHERE'S SIMILARITIES IN THE DEVICES.\nWE DO KNOW THE DEVICES APPEAR TO HAVE HAD A CELL PHONE ATTACHED\nTO THEM. BUT THE ONES IN NEW JERSEY WERE\nONLY ONE OF THE THREE PIPE BOMBS DETONATED YESTERDAY.\nAND THESE ARE THE COMMONALITIES AND IT HAPPENS TO MAKE A GREAT\nCONSEQUENCE AND I SPOKE TO A SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL\nEARLIER TODAY. WHEN YOU HAVE THESE YOU HAVE TO\nLOOK MORE DEEPLY BECAUSE IT DOESN'T USUALLY BREAK THAT WAY.\n>> WE'RE SEEING THIS CAR THAT THEY WERE INVESTIGATING AND I\nKNOW YOU WERE STANDING THERE EARLIER REPORTING ON WHAT WAS\nGOING ON. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT.\n>> THERE'S THE FACT THAT THIS CAR HAD NEW JERSEY LICENSE\nPLATES. YESTERDAY IN NEW JERSEY THE\nQUESTION WAS COULD THAT BE CONNECTED?\nAND WHY IS IT IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA OF WHERE THESE DEVICES\nFOUND IN MANHATTAN. IT COULD ALSO BE THAT THIS CAR\nHAS SHRAPNEL IN IT. CLEARLY THERE'S EVIDENCE.\nYOU CAN SEE THERE WAS A WOMAN THERE TAKING A LOT OF\nPHOTOGRAPHS AND WORKING AT DIFFERENT MARKS AND THINGS IN\nTHE CAR AND TOOK IT AWAY FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS.\nSO THAT WAS A PARTICULAR INTEREST.\nTHE FACT THAT IT WAS PARKED ON 23rd STREET JUST A BLOCK FROM\nWHERE THAT DEVICE DETONATED THAT IS ALSO OF INTEREST.\nHOW IT ENDED UP THERE. SO INVESTIGATORS NOW ARE GETTING\nENOUGH CLUES AND ENOUGH DETAILS THAT THEY CAN BEGIN TO SORT OF\nSPIDER OUT FROM THERE AND LOOK AT HOW THE THREADS CONNECT.\n>> AND THEY HAVE THAT VIDEO SURVEILLANCE AS WELL.\nIT'S CERTAINLY ON GOING. >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR REPORTING.\nRACHEL CRANE ON THE SCENE IN ELIZABETH NEW JERSEY.\nWE'LL STAY IN TOUCH WITH YOU BOTH.\n>> JUST BEFORE THAT EXPLOSION WENT OFF AT NEW YORK STABBINGS\nAT A SHOPPING MALL IN STFLT CLOUD, MINNESOTA.\nWOUNDED AT LEAST 9 PEOPLE. ONE CRITICALLY.\nTHE FBI IS INVESTIGATING THAT INCIDENT AS A POTENTIAL ACT OF\nTERROR. ONE WITNESS THAT WORKED AT THE\nMALL DESCRIBED WHAT SHE SAW. LISTEN.\n>> ALL OF A SUDDEN CHAOS JUST BROKE OUT.\nTHERE IS A BUNCH OF PEOPLE RUNNING INTO THE JCPENNEY MALL\nENTRANCE AND THEY WERE JUST SCREAMING THAT SOMEONE WAS GOING\nAROUND THE MALL STABBING PEOPLE AND THAT THERE WAS BLOOD\nEVERYWHERE. AND IT WAS JUST HONESTLY A\nREALLY SCARY THING AND TROPICAL WAVED EVERYTHING AND BOOKED IT\nBACK TO MY CO-WORKER TO NOTIFY HER WHAT WAS GOING ON.\nI RAN OUT A DIFFERENT EXIT OUT OF OUR JCPENNEYS THAT LEAD\nSTRAIGHT TO THE PARKING LOT AND I JUMPED INTO MY CAR AND RAN OFF\nAS FAST AS I COULD. >> THAT HAD TO BE TERRIFYING.\nPOLICE SAY THE ATTACKER APPEARS TO HAVE ACTED ALONE.\nTHE CITY'S MAYOR PRAISED THE OFF DUTY POLICE OFFICER THAT SHOT\nAND KILLED THE ATTACKER. >> HE CLEARLY PREVENTED\nADDITIONAL INJURIES AND LOSS OF LIFE.\nHIS HEROIC ACTIONS OR HAVING WITNESSED WHAT HE DID AND THE\nSUSPECT IS LUNGING WITH HIM AND NOT ONLY DID HE FIRE BUT THE\nSUSPECT WENT DOWN AND CAME BACK UP ON THREE DIFFERENT OCCASIONS.\n>> SO IF YOU'RE COUNTING THERE'S A SITUATION THERE IN MINNESOTA.\nTWO SITUATIONS IN NEW JERSEY. AND WE'RE DISCOVERING TONIGHT\nAND ALSO CERTAINLY NEW YORK. FRONT AND CENTER.\nTHERE WAS NO CLEAR LINK BETWEEN ALL THE ATTACKS THROUGHOUT THE\nU.S. IT'S THE TIMING RAISING A LOT OF\nCONCERN. >> WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE TIMING\nTHAT IS INTERESTING TO YOU? >> FIRST OF ALL IT'S ALL\nHAPPENING SO FAST. ALL WITHIN THE PERIOD OF 24\nHOURS THIS IS ALL TAKING PLACE AND ORDINARILY I WOULD PUT THE\nTIMING TO OCTOBER AND OCTOBER WAS ALWAYS THE MONTH WHERE WE\nWERE NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE AS MUCH LOCATION.\nTIME OFF WAS LIMITED AND YOU COULDN'T SCHEDULE THINGS BECAUSE\nOF THE GENERAL IS SEMIBLI. AND MOVING ALL AROUND THE CITY\nSO YOU HAVE EXTRA SECURITY FROM THOSE COUNTRIES COMING IN.\nYOU HAVE EXTRA SECRET SERVICE. A STATE DEPARTMENT DIPLOMATIC\nSECURITY AND IT WAS A HUGE COORDINATION EFFORT AND THEN\nWHEN YOU HAVE THESE THINGS TAKING PLACE AT THE SAME TIME\nTHAT JUST HEIGHTENED EVERYBODY'S AWARENESS.\n>> I'D LIKE TO GET YOUR SENSE OF THINGS SO I'M SURE YOU HEARD OUR\nCORRESPONDENT REPORTING THERE AND WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?\n>> I'M SURE THAT THERE ARE ALL OF THESE INCIDENCES PROPERLY\nBEING WORKED CLOSELY TOGETHER. AND IT'S PROBABLY IN CONSTANT\nCONTACT WITH THE JTTF IN NEW YORK AND THEY'RE PROBABLY\nTRADING IN NEW YORK. ALL OF THEM WILL GO QUICKLY TO\nBE EXAMINED IF FOR COMMONALITIES AND THEY'LL KNOW IT AS QUICKLY\nAS THEY CAN GET IT DOWN THERE. NOBODY WILL REST.\nEVERYBODY WILL BE WORKING ON THIS THING CONSTANTLY BUT AS\nIT'S MOVING FORWARD MORE INCIDENTS KEEP HAPPENING AS WE\nSPEAK SO IT'S GOING TO BE A BUSY TIME.\n>> CERTAINLY AND THE PRESSURE IS ON TO TRY TO BRING THIS TO A\nCONCLUSION. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE FACT\nTHAT THEY HAVE SURVEILLANCE VIDEO.\nTHEY HAVE SOMEONE SUSPICIOUS IN THE VIDEO BUT THEY'RE NOT\nRELEASING IT TO THE PUBLIC FOR ANY HELP.\n>> I THINK THAT MIGHT INDICATE THAT THEY HAVE WHAT THEY FEEL IS\nENOUGH TO PROVIDE THEM WITH WHAT THEY NEED TO IDENTIFY THE PERSON\nSO IN OTHER WORDS YOU ONLY GO OUT TO THE PUBLIC IF YOU NEED TO\nGO OUT TO THE PUBLIC. IF THERE'S ENOUGH IN THAT VIDEO\nFOR THEM TO IDENTIFY THE INDIVIDUAL OR IF THEY CAN TO IT\nIN A LESS PUBLIC WAY, THEY CAN TWO TO CERTAIN PEOPLE THAT THEY\nTHINK MIGHT KNOW THAT INDIVIDUAL THEN THEY CAN DO THAT.\nTHE LESS YOU CAN MAKE PUBLIC IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ADDITIONAL\nCO-CONSPIRATORS IT'S DIFFERENT AT THAT POINT.\n>> I WANT TO GET SOME CONTEXT FROM YOU GIVEN YOUR EXPERIENCE\nIN THIS ARENA. THE PRECISION THAT GOES INTO A\nTRAFFIC STOP THAT HAPPENS ON A BRIDGE, TALK TO US ABOUT THAT.\nAND NO ONE HAS OPINION CHARGED WITH ANYTHING BUT WE DO\nUNDERSTAND THIS IS BEING CON NECKED TO THE SITUATION, THAT\nEXPLOSION IN NEW YORK. >> CLEARLY SOMETHING LEAD THEM\nTO THAT VEHICLE AND THEN THEY GOT ON TO THE VEHICLE AND\nTRAFFIC STOPS ARE ALWAYS A DANGEROUS THING FOR ANY POLICE\nOFFICER TO ENGAGE IN. THE BRIDGE MAY HAVE BEEN THE\nPERFECT TIME TO DO IT BECAUSE YOU HAVE MORE CONTROL OVER WHERE\nTHE CAR IS GOING TO GO. THEY MIGHT HAVE COVERAGE AT BOTH\nENDS OF THE BRIDGE. THEY CAN DELAY TRAFFIC IN THE\nAREA EASILY. MORE EASILY ON A BRIDGE.\nSO IT'S A MORE CONTROLLED VIERLT WHEN YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING LIKE\nTHAT AND THE FACT THAT THE NYPD AND THE FBI WERE DOING IT\nTOGETHER JOINTLY ADDS TO THE SAFETY FACTOR FOR THE OFFICERS\nINVOLVED. >> WE APPRECIATE YOU JOINING US\nTO HELP US UNDERSTAND THIS PROCESS.\nTHANK YOU BOBBY. >> BOBBY, THANK YOU.\nYOU'RE WATCHING CNN NEWSROOM. WE CONTINUE FOLLOWING THE BREAK\nNEWS OUT OF NEW YORK AND OUT OF NEW JERSEY BUT OTHER STORIES\nWE'RE FOLLOWING AND AHEAD THIS HOUR, A THRIVING CITY BEFORE\nTHOUSANDS LEFT IT. WE GO INSIDE OF ALEPPO TO SEE\nHOW SYRIANS THAT STAYED BEHIND THERE ARE HANGING ON.\n>> ALSO AHEAD, AN ARMY BASE COMES UNDER ATTACK WITH DEADLY\nCONSEQUENCES. THIS IS A FLASHPOINT REGION AND\nTHERE IS REASON FOR CONCERN THAT IT IS HEATING UP.\nWE'LL BE BACK WITH THAT AS WELL.                                .",

DEBRA, AS FAR AS WE KNOW THERE\nWAS A TRAFFIC STOP THAT HAPPENED ON A BRIDGE.\nWHAT MORE CAN YOU TELL US? >> Reporter: AT ABOUT 8:45\nSUNDAY EVENING, THIS WAS A VEHICLE OF INTEREST.\nTHAT'S HOW THE FBI DESCRIBED. BUT THEY ALSO SAY THAT NO ONE\nHAS BEEN CHARGED WITH ANY CRIME. OBVIOUSLY, A LOT OF QUESTIONS.\nHOW DID THIS VEHICLE BECOME A VEHICLE OF INTEREST?\nINVESTIGATORS RIGHT NOW FOLLOWING A LOT OF THREADS, A\nLOT OF REALLY STRONG CLUES THAT THEY DEVELOPED OVER THE COURSE\nOF THE LAST 24 HOURS. WE CAN TELL YOU SOURCES NOW TELL\nCNN LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS SURVEILLANCE VIDEO OF THE MAN\nTHEY BELIEVE WAS NEAR BOTH THE DUMPSTER BUT ALSO THE SECOND\nLOCATION. NOW, THE MAN WAS ROLLING A BLACK\nDUFFEL BAG. HE IS SEEN AT THE DUMPSTER ON\nWEST 23rd STREET. HE THEN MAKES HIS WAY NORTH UP\nTO 27th STREET, FOUR BLOCKS, LEAVES THE DUFFEL BAG AND THEN\nWALKS AWAY. TWO MEN SUBSEQUENTLY COME UP,\nOPEN THE DUFFEL BAG, TAKE OUT THE DEVICE, AND WALK AWAY WITH\nTHE DUFFEL BAG. IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT CONNECTION\nTHEY HAVE TO THIS PARTICULAR INCIDENT WHETHER THEY JUST\nWANTED TO TAKE THE DUFFEL BAG, BUT 40 MINUTES ELAPSES FROM THE\nTIME THAT MAN IS IDENTIFIED ON THE SURVEILLANCE VIDEO TO THE\nTIME THE BOMB DETONATES. AND INVESTIGATORS DID FIND A\nCELL PHONE ON THE DEVICE THAT DID NOT DETONATE.\nTHAT IS A CRUCIAL PIECE OF EVIDENCE THEY'RE LOOKING AT VERY\nCLOSELY TO SEE WHETHER ANY CALLS WERE MADE INTO THAT PHONE\nBECAUSE THAT COULD LEAD THEM TO IDENTIFY WHO MAY HAVE BEEN IN\nTHAT AREA AND WHAT NUMBER THEY MAY HAVE BEEN CALLING FROM, A\nSOURCE EARLIER TELLING ME THAT THE FACT THAT THERE'S A CELL\nPHONE INVOLVED COULD SUGGEST THAT IT WAS USED AS A DETONATOR\nTO EXPLODE THE DEVICE, AND THE CALL COULD HAVE BEEN MADE FROM\nANYWHERE. NOW POLICE OFFICERS DID FIND\nTHAT SECOND DEVICE. THEY WERE DOING A SWEEP OF THE\nAREA. ONCE THE FIRST BOMB EXPLODED.\nAND THAT'S WHEN HAD HE FOUND THAT.\nTHE NEW YORK BOMB SQUAD WAS ABLE TODAY TO RENDER THE DEVICE SAFE.\nTHAT MEANS THEY WERE ABLE TO SEND IT DOWN TO THE FBI LAB IN\nQUANTICO FOR A MORE THOROUGH ANALYSIS.\nBUT THE TWO BIG QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW, WHO DID THIS, WHY DID THEY\nDO THIS, AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT MULTIPLE CONNECTIONS TO MULTIPLE\nINCIDENTS THAT SEEM TO BE OCCURRING REALLY IN THIS NOW\n36-HOUR SPAN, BUT KEEP IN MIND, DOLLARS THE UNITED NATIONS\nGENERAL ASSEMBLY THAT'S GOING TO BE IN NEW YORK CITY THIS WEEK.\nA LOT OF WORLD LEADERS ARE COMING TO TOWN.\nSECURITY WAS ALREADY TIGHT. IT'S GOING TO BE EVEN TIGHTER AS\nTHE FBI, THE NYPD, ATF, ALL OF THEM WORK VERY CLOSELY TOGETHER\nIN ORDER TO TRY TO FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING ON HERE.\n>> ABSOLUTELY, SOME VERY BUSY TIMES THERE.\nWE WANT TO SAY THE GOOD NEWS IS THE PEOPLE THAT WERE WOUNDED ARE\nNOW ALL OUT OF THE HOSPITAL AND DOING OKAY.\nTHAT'S THE ONE GOOD THING WE HAVE THAT VERY MUCH GRATEFUL FOR\nTHAT. THANK YOU, DEBORAH IN NEW YORK.\n>> ALL OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS COME AFTER ANOTHER INCIDENT IN\nNEW JERSEY ON SATURDAY. THIS WAS AN EXPLOSION IN A TRASH\nCAN.

AND IN THIS CRIME\nSCENE THEY FOUND THIS DINGY THING WITH A SERIAL NUMBER ON IT\nAND TRACED IT BACK TO A PLACE IN GERMANY AND SOLVED THAT CASE.\n>> SINCE NO ARRESTS HAVE BEEN MADE YET, NEW YORK\nLEADERS ARE TAKING NO CHANCES. >> WE WILL BE DEPLOYING CLOSE TO\nAN ADDITIONAL 1,000 NEW YORK STATE POLICE AND NATIONAL GUARD\nPEOPLE TO POLICE THE BUS TERMINAL AND AIRPORTS AND SUBWAY\nSTATIONS. I WANT NEW YORKERS TO BE\nCONFIDENT WHEN THEY GO BACK TO WORK ON MONDAY.\n>> WE'VE SPOKEN TO THE WOMAN WHO FOUND THE SECOND IED AND CALLED\nIT IN. HER NAME IS JANE SHRIVNER AND\nSHE'S 66 YEARS OLD. SHE SAW A PRESSURE COOKER AND\nKNEW IT COULD BE USED TO BUILD A BOMB AND HER CALL THAT GOT A\nBOMB SQUAD THERE WITHIN MINUTES LIKELY SAVED A LOT OF PEOPLE\nFROM SERIOUS INJURY OR WORSE. BRET.\n>> WE'LL FOLLOW THIS INVESTIGATION CLOSELY.\nA LOT OF VIDEO CAMERAS IN THAT AREA.\nAND WE'LL SEE WHAT INVESTIGATORS HAVE.\nBUT HAVE THEY, PETER, DIRECTLY DISCOVERED A CONNECTION BETWEEN\nTHE BOMBINGS IN NEW YORK CITY AND NEW JERSEY EARLIER\nYESTERDAY? >> NOT YET, BRET.\nTHERE ARE OBVIOUS SIMILARITIES IN PROXIMITY.\nA TWO-HOUR DRIVE BETWEEN THE BLAST LOCATIONS.\nAND TIMING, JUST ABOUT 11 HOURS APART, BUT THERE ARE DIFFERENCES\nAS WELL. IN NEW JERSEY IT WAS PIPE BOMBS\nAND HERE IS WAS PRESSURE COOKER BOMBS AND AT THIS HOUR WE STILL\nDO NOT KNOW IF THERE IS A COMMON PERSON AT THE TWO LOCATIONS OR\nIF THERE IS ANYTHING THAT LINKS THE TOWN IN NEW JERSEY TO THE\nSPOTS IN CHELSEA.

THEN YOU MOVE TO LOWER MANHATTAN\nWHERE THE BOMBS WENT OFF. SUNDAY NIGHT FIVE PEOPLE WERE\nARRESTED IN BROOKLYN. THEY ARE BEING HELD FOR\nQUESTIONING. ALSO THE TRAIN STATION IN\nELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY WHERE FOUR OF THE FIVE PIPE BOMBS WERE\nDISCOVERED. LET'S GO FURTHER IN MANHATTAN.\nTHIS WOULD BE NORTH, SOUTH, THAT WOULD BE WEST AND EAST.\nTHIS IS WEST 23rd STREET IN LOWER MANHATTAN WHERE THE FIRST\nEXPLOSION WENT OFF AT 8:30 AT NIGHT.\n3 HOURS LATER THE SECOND DEVICE FOUND IN A PLASTIC BAG SITTING\nON THE STREET ON 27th STREET. WHAT'S THE SIGNIFICANCE BETWEEN\nTHE TWO? THEY ARE CONNECTED, THEY ARE\nTIED TOGETHER. THIS STREET RUNS ONE WAY\nEAST-WEST. 23rd STREET GOES IN THE BOTH\nDIRECTIONS. SO WHETHER THEY WERE DROPPED OFF\nBY SOMEONE WALKING OR IN A VEHICLE, WE DON'T KNOW.\nMAYBE THAT'S SIGNIFICANT, MAYBE IT'S NOT.\nROB, LET'S START WITH YOU TODAY. WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN AND WHAT'S\nHAPPENING. >> WE ARE AT THE SCENE OF THAT\nEXPLOSION SATURDAY NIGHT IN CHELSEA.\n28-YEAR-OLD AHMAD KAHN RAHAMI IS THE MAN POLICE AND F.B.I. ARE\nLOOKING FOR. HE'S OF AFGHAN DESCENT,\nNATURALIZED IN THE UNITED STATES.\nLIVING WITH HIS FAMILY IN NEW JERSEY.\nNEIGHBORS SAY HE WORKED AT A CHICKEN RESTAURANT OWNED BY THE\nFAMILY. HE WORKED BEHIND THE COUNTER.\nF.B.I. AGENTS RAIDING RAHAMI'S APARTMENT.\nA MILE AWAY FROM THERE BOMBS WERE FOUND IN A BACKPACK.\nONE WENT OFF AS POLICE TRIED TO DISARM IT.\nLOOK AT THE POWER OF THAT BLAST. THERE IT IS.\nJUST MOMENTS AGO, A LINE OF F.B.I. EVIDENCE GATHERERS TRYING\nTO FIND SOMETHING ON THE STREET. MAYBE SOMETHING SMALL NECESSITY\nMISSED. F.B.I. AGENTS DID PULL OVER A\nCAR OR TRUCK IN BROOKLYN ON THE BELT PARKWAY THAT HAD FIVE\nPEOPLE INSIDE OF IT, ALL CONSIDERED TO BE PERSONS OF\nINTEREST AND THEY MAY HAVE LED THE F.B.I. AND POLICE TO KAHN IN\nNEW JERSEY. YOU CAN SEAT PANIC IN CHELSEA\nAND SEE PEOPLE RUNNING FOR THEIR LIVES.\nPEOPLE WERE TERRIFIED, A MORE ICIAL SCENE, THANK THINK NOBODY\nWAS KILLED. BILL: THERE IS A REPORT FROM\nRIGHTERS THAT MORE PEOPLE WERE INVOLVED THAN THE PICTURE OF THE\n28-YEAR-OLD WE PUT ON THE AIR. REPORTER: INVESTIGATORS ARE\nSAYING THERE IS GOING TO BE MORE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THIS.\nTHEY ARE STILL LOOK FOR MORE PEOPLE.\nWE HAVE VIDEO OF WHAT COULD BE TWO PEOPLE GETTING INTO THAT BAG\nYOU MENTIONED. THAT BOMB FOUR BLOCKS THAT\nDIDN'T GO OFF. TWO PEOPLE GOT THAT BAG, SO\nTHAT'S AT LEAST 6. IT COULD BE A CELL OR A NETWORK.\nBUT WITH THE U.N. IN TOWN, RAHAMI IS SOMEBODY THEY WANT TO\nGET CAUGHT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. BILL: THANKS, ROB.\nMARTHA: JOINING US NOW IS RETIRED NAVY LIEUTENANT\nCOMMANDER STEVE ROGERS. HE'S A FORMER MEMBER OF THE\nJOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCE. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE\nRESPONSE? TERMS OF HOW THE PUBLIC HAS\nRESPONDED. IT SEEMS MUTED IN SOME WAYS.\nYOU WONDER IF WE ARE JUST GETTING USED TO THIS.\n>> WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS A COORDINATED WAR BEING WAGED\nAGAINST THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE BEEN ATTACKED BEFORE.\nBUT THIS SEEMS LIKE A COORDINATED ATTEMPT TO STRIKE AT\nUS. THIS IS SOMETHING WE FEARED.\nBUT WE KNEW AT SOME POINT IN TIME IT WOULD HAPPEN.\nLET'S TALK ABOUT THAT RESPONSE. THE RESPONSE EXTRAORDINARY.\nNO QUESTION ABOUT IT. RESPONSE FROM THE PUBLIC.\nWE SAY IF YOU SEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING.\nMOST OF THESE LEADS HAVE BEEN GIVEN BY PEOPLE MONTH WHO SAW\nSOMETHING AND SAID SOMETHING. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE RESPONSE\nFROM THE WHITE HOUSE. HE HASN'T SPOKEN TO GOVERNOR\nCUOMO YET, I DON'T KNOW IF HE TALKED TO GOVERNOR CHRISTIE.\nSOME OF OUR NATIONAL REPRESENTATIVES CAN'T COME TO\nGRIPS WITH THE FACT THIS IS A TERRORIST ATTACK.\nWE ARE SEEING A WAR BEING WAGED AGAINST THIS COUNTRY AND OUR\nLEADERS NEED TO STEP UP. MARTHA: THIS DEVICE COULD BE A\nFLOWN WOLF. I READ AT STATEMENT PUT OUT IN\nONE OF THE ISIS PUBLIC RELATIONS FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD\nMISSIVE WHICH SAYS IF YOU CAN'T COME HERE, YOU HAVE TO DO\nSOMETHING AT HOME. WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT TO TIE\nTHIS TO SOMETHING THAT IS LARGER THAN POTENTIALLY ONE CRAZY GUY\nAND RELATIVES IN NEW JERSEY. >> WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE WHAT WE\nCALL HUMAN INTELLIGENCE TO GET THAT INFORMATION OUT OF\nSOMEBODY, YOU DON'T KNOW. HOWEVER, SAYING THAT, WE KNOW\nTHERE ARE SIX PEOPLE AT A MINIMUM INVOLVED.\nIT MAY BE A CELL OR NETWORK. WHAT WE HAVE TO KNOW IS IF IN\nFACT THIS WAS A TERRORIST ACT BY OVERSEAS DIRECTION, THIS CELL\nGET DIRECTIONS FROM AN OVERSEAS ENTITY?\nAND IF THEY DID, WHETHER IT BE ISIS OR ANOTHER TYPE OF\nORGANIZATION OVERSEAS, WE MAY HAVE MORE CELLS READY TO BE\nACTIVATED. THESE ARE COMING CLOSER\nAND CLOSER TO OUR ELECTION. IT APPEARS THEY MAY BE TARGETING\nOUR ELECTION TO DISRUPT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THIS COUNTRY\nIN NOVEMBER. IT'S A DIFFICULT AND DAUNTING\nTASK. WE HAVE TO STOP THE POLITICAL\nCORRECTNESS AND SANITIZING INFORMATION FROM OUR LEADERS.\nWE NEED TO MAKE SURE THE TRUTH BE TOLD.\nMARTHA: EVERYBODY WATCHED THIS UNFOLD SATURDAY NIGHT.\nTHERE WAS A BOMB DEVICE FOUND IN AND TRASH CAN AND TWO THAT ARE\nBLOCKS APART IN MANHATTAN, AND PEOPLE ARE TELLING YOU, WE DON'T\nSEE ANY CONNECTION. EVERYBODY WATCHING ARE SAYING\nHOW COULD IT NOT BE CONNECTED? IT'S OBVIOUS.\n>> THOSE OF US WHO MADE A CAREER OUT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND\nINTELLIGENCE. WE KNEW RIGHT AWAY.\nYOU HAVE A COOKER PRESSURE. THEN AND BOMB ON 23rd.\nTHEN IT'S AN UNKNOWN FACTOR, THE INCIDENT IN MINNESOTA.\nTHE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, WE ARE AT WAR AND WE START -- WE\nBETTER START FIGHTING THIS AS A WAR.\nMARTHA: IN TERMS OF THE DEVICES, SIMILAR TO WHAT WE SAW AND\nCONSTRUCTION AND ANYBODY'S ABILITY TO MAKE IT?\n>> THE PRESSURE COOKER. YOU CAN GET ON THE INTERNET AND\nLEARN HOW TO MAKE THESE DEVICES OFF ANY INTERNET-TYPE ENTITY.\nBUT WHAT WE HAVE IS THE COORDINATION OF THIS ATTACK.\nTHIS IS A WELL-COORDINATED ATTACK.\nMY CONCERN IS THERE ARE MORE OUT THERE.\nTHEY HAVE GOT TO GET THIS GUY. IN REGARDS TO THE SEARCH WARRANT\nEXECUTED THIS MORNING. THE TIMING IS INTERESTING.\nBUT THE STOP THE POLICE MADE LAST NIGHT, IT SEEMS TO ME THEY\nDID GET SOME CRITICAL INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION THAT\nALLOWED THEM TO GET ENOUGH PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THE JUDGE TO\nAGREE TO A SEARCH WARRANT. THAT WAS GOOD POLICE WORK.\nMARTHA: AND GOOD CIVILIAN WORK, THE GUISE WHO SPOTTED THE\nBACKPACK IN THE GARBAGE CAN. EVERYBODY HAS TO BE SO HYPER\nALERT. >> IF YOU SEE THIS GUY OR ANYONE\nYOU THINK IS INVOLVED IN TERRORISM, DO NOT TAKE THE LAW\nINTO YOUR OWN HANDS. THESE ARE DANGEROUS PEOPLE.\nTHEY MAY END UP MARTYRING THEMSELVES.\nMARTHA: YOU KNOW IN BOSTON, THE TSARNAEV BROTHERS, THE F.B.I.\nPUT THEIR PICTURES UP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nBILL: THE NATION ON EDGE. WHAT IS THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING\nSO FAR. MARTHA: THE PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATES WITH DIFFERENT TAKES WHEN THIS WAS UNFOLDING.\nDONALD TRUMP SLAMMING HILLARY CLINTON SAYING THIS IS NO TIME\nTO WORRY ABOUT WHAT HE CALLS POLITICAL CORRECTNESS.\n>> DO WE REALLY HAVE A CHOICE? WE ARE TRYING TO BE SO\nPOLITICALLY CORRECT IN OUR COUNTRY.\nAND THIS IS ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE.\nTHIS ISN'T GOING TO GET BETTER. THIS IS ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE.",

HE'S BASICALLY SAYING, LISTEN,\nTHESE ARE ALL GOOD, BUT I RECOGNIZE, YES, FACEBOOK'S\nOPPORTUNITY TOTAL ADJUSTMENT FOR FACEBOOK IS NOT AS BIG AS FOR\nAMAZON, I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT.\nA LOT OF RETAILERS TRADING UP THERE.\n>> FACEBOOK WITH AN EMMY WIN LAST NIGHT AS WELL.\nSOMETHING NEW FOR THEM. MEANWHILE, DOW'S UP ABOUT 93\nPOINTS. BOB PISANI'S ON THE FLOOR.\nHEY, BOB. >> AND A NICE START TO THE WEEK,\nCARL. HAPPY MONDAY MORNING.\nDOW'S UP 90 AS YOU MENTIONED. EUROPE'S UP AS WELL AFTER A\nLOUSY WEEK LAST WEEK, AND FORGET ABOUT THAT ONE.\nWE'RE DOING ALL RIGHT OVER IN EUROPE.\nMOST OF THE BANKS ARE UP. SOME OF THE ITALIAN BANKS ARE\nUP, UNICREDIT, BANCO SANTANDER, DEUTSCHE BANK IS UP, TOTAL IS UP\nAND AUTOS WHICH WERE A BIG LEADING INDICATOR, LIKE DIAMLER,\nALSO ON THE UPSIDE. SECTORS HERE IN THE U.S. WITH\nOIL UP NICELY HERE ON MORE RUMORS ABOUT SOME SUPPLY\nCONSTRAINTS, PERHAPS. ENERGY IS UP.\nBANK STOCKS ARE DOING BETTER HERE.\nTECH, WHICH WAS THE BIG MARKET LEADER LAST WEEK, PARTICULARLY\nAPPLE. AND THERE IT IS THE S&P 500 REAL\nESTATE SECTORS, WE TALKED ABOUT ALL LAST WEEK, THERE IS NOW AN\nELEVENTH SECTOR. THIS IS THE FIRST MORNING IT\nSTARTED TRADING. YOU CAN SEE IT'S UP\nFRACTIONALLY. REITs GOT HIT LAST WEEK ON RATE\nCONCERNS, BUT OVERALL THEY'VE OUTPERFORMED THIS YEAR.\nREITs ARE UP ABOUT 6% OR 7%, OUTPERFORMING THE S&P BY ABOUT\nTWO PERCENTAGE POINTS. WE HAD LONG TERM INTEREST RATES\nSTAYING LOW. THAT HELPS REITs.\nWE HAD HIGH DIVIDENDS TYPICALLY PAYING 4%.\nAND THIS TALK ABOUT THIS NEW CREATION OF THIS NEW SECTOR HAS\nALSO DRIVEN SOME INTEREST AS WELL HERE.\nBEST PERFORMERS IN THE REITs, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I KNOW YOU'LL\nFIND THIS AMAZING, BUT RETAIL REITs HAVE DONE VERY WELL\nBECAUSE THE BIGGEST AND THE BEST GUYS OUT THERE, YOUR EQUITY\nONES, YOUR KIMCOS, SIMON PROPERTIES, THEY HAVE ACCESS TO\nTHE VERY BEST REAL ESTATE AND VERY BEST RETAIL PEOPLE OUT\nTHERE. SO THE TOP END MALLS ARE AMONG\nTHE BEST PERFORMERS. IT'S THE LOWER END MALLS, THE\nSTRIP MALLS HAVING TROUBLE. YOU'LL SEE A LOT OF THEM GET\nBULLDOZED OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS, I PREDICT, OVERALL.\nNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ASKING WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU OWN THE\nFINANCIALS IN THE S&P 500 BECAUSE THE REITs ARE GONE OUT?\nAND THE ANSWER IS THAT YOU GET A DISTRIBUTION.\nTHAT'S WHY YOU HAVE THE XLF, THEY'RE GOING TO BE DISTRIBUTING\nPARTS OF THE XLF, WHICH WERE REITs, SPINNING IT OFF OF COURSE\nINTO A SEPARATE SECTOR FOR HOLDERS OF THE ETF.\nTHAT'S WHY YOU'LL SEE THESE GYRATIONS IN THE S&P FINANCIAL\nSECTOR THIS WEEK BECAUSE OF THE DISTRIBUTION THAT'S GOING ON.\nWHEN IT'S ALL OVER, REITs WILL BE 3% OF THE S&P, ABOUT THE SAME\nAS MATERIAL STOCKS, ABOUT THE SAME AS TELECOM STOCKS.\nTALK MORE ABOUT THAT LATER. I JUST WANT TO SHOW YOU GM\nTHOUGH WHICH IS UP NICELY. GM HAS NOT HAD A GOOD YEAR\nOBVIOUSLY. AUTOS DOWN ABOUT 6% ON THE YEAR.\nI THOUGHT IT WAS A BOLD CALL BY THE ANALYSTS AT MORGAN STANLEY\nHERE WITH THEIR NUMBERS BECAUSE BY AND LARGE MOST OF THE\nESTIMATES FOR SEPTEMBER HAVE BEEN COMING DOWN.\nAND IF YOU TAKE A LOOK HERE WHAT'S GOING ON, ONLY SEVEN\nANALYST HAVES A BUY ON THIS RIGHT NOW.\nTEN HAVE A HOLD. AND NONE HAVE A SELL.\nYOU KNOW IT'S 70%, 80% BUY FOR MOST OF THE ANALYSTS ON ALL THE\nSTOCKS, THIS IS A PRETTY PESSIMISTIC GROUP IN GM.\nTHAT'S WHY I LOVE THE GUY FOR MAKING A BOLD CALL.\nAS FOR THE FED, THIS IS A TOUGH ONE BECAUSE THE ODDS SAY 15%,\n20%, AND YET WHY IS THE ANXIETY LEVEL SO HIGH DOWN HERE THAT THE\nFED MIGHT IN FACT TRY TO DO SOMETHING?\nA LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL THE FED REALLY DOES AND THEY'RE GOING TO\nTRY TO SURPRISE PEOPLE. SO THERE'S THIS SORT OF\nPARALYSIS MODE GOING ON. NOBODY BELIEVES THE 15% CHANCE\nAND THEY THINK THEY COULD GET SURPRISED IN OFF SIDES ON THE\nMARKET HERE. BEST BET AVERAGE PERSON DOWN\nHERE THINKS NO HIKE, BUT A LOT OF HAWKISH TALK AGAIN ABOUT\nDECEMBER, WHICH ALSO CREATES A LITTLE MORE ANXIETY.\nGUYS, I'VE NEVER SEEN IT SO ANXIOUS DOWN HERE ON A RATE HIKE\nTHAT NOBODY BELIEVES IS ACTUALLY GOING TO HAPPEN.\nIT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A STRANGE PSYCHOLOGICAL SITUATION TO BE\nIN. RIGHT NOW THE DOW UP 88 POINTS.\nBACK TO YOU. >> BOB, THANKS A LOT.\nBOB PISANI. MEANWHILE, WE ARE WATCHING OIL\nPRICES. JACKIE DEANGELIS AT THE NYMEX\nTHIS MORNING. HEY, JACKIE.\n>> GOOD MORNING TO YOU, CARL. THAT'S RIGHT, OIL PRICES TRADING\nHIGHER THIS MORNING, BUT STILL WELL UNDER THAT $45 A BARREL\nMARK. NOW, SOME MIXED MESSAGES FROM\nOPEC OVER THE WEEKEND. THE SECRETARY GENRE MINDING\nEVERYBODY THAT THE ALGERIA MEETING IS INFORMAL.\nSO THE LOGICAL INFERENCE THERE IS NO DECISION IS REALLY\nEXPECTED. MEANTIME YOU HAVE THE\nVENEZUELANS OUT SAYING A DEAL COULD BE VERY CLOSE.\nSO YOU SEE THIS FRAGMENTATION GOING ON WITHIN THE CARTEL.\nTHEN OF COURSE SOME CHATTER IN THE MARKETPLACE ABOUT AN\nEMERGENCY MEETING, MAYBE SOMETHING MORE FORMAL AFTER\nALGERIA, TO FINALIZE SOME SORT OF A PLAN.\nSO A LOT OF UNKNOWNS WHEN IT COMES TO OPEC.\nMEANTIME, I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT RBOB GASOLINE THIS MORNING, IT'S\nTRADING DOWN DESPITE THE FACT CRUDE IS COMING UP.\nWE HAVE AN UPDATE ON THE COLONIAL PIPELINE IINCIDENT.\nTHE COMPANY IS WORKING ON A BYPASS TO HELP DELIVER SUPPLIES\nTO SOME OF THE STATES IN THE SOUTHEAST THAT SUFFERED THIS\nWEEKEND. AND THEY SAW GAS PRICES SPIKE AT\nTHE PUMP. SO THIS IS SOMETHING TO WATCH,\nBUT THE EXPECTATION IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME\nRESOLUTION BY THE END OF THE WEEK AND THAT THIS WAS A\nTEMPORARY BLIP. BACK TO YOU, CARL.\n>> JACKIE, THANKS SO MUCH. WHEN WE COME BACK, THE LEGENDARY\nJIM BURROWS DIRECTED SHOWS LIKE \"CHEERS,\" \"FRIENDS,\" WILL &\nGRACE,\" WE'LL GET HIS TAKE ON THE EMMYS LAST NIGHT.\nAND ALSO JON FORTT IN SAN FRANCISCO WHERE HE'LL TALK WITH\nORACLE'S MARK HURD.

SIMPLE.\nEVERY TIME OIL GOES DOWN TO THE LOW 40s, LIKE IT DID LAST WEEK\nAFTER A PERSISTENT HAMMERING, WE GET A RUMOR FROM OIL PRODUCERS\nTHAT A PRODUCTION FREEZE IS IMMINENT.\nSURE ENOUGH, THIS WEEKEND THE DESPERATE BUT VERY SHREWD OIL\nMINISTERS PLAYED THEIR PARTS TO THE HILT IN MANIPULATING OIL\nUPWARDS. HERE'S HOW IT WORKS IN THE FACE\nOF A MOUNTAIN OF OIL SWIRLING. FIRST TAKE A LOOK AT A ROIT\nSTORY THAT RAN UNDER THE HEADLINE, VENEZUELA SAID OPEC\nNON-OPEC OIL STABILIZING DEAL CLOSE.\nWITH A DATE LINE OF MARGARITA ISLAND, WHERE THERE WAS A SUMMIT\nOF THE NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT. THE STATEMENT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN\nMORE DEFINITIVE AND I QUOTE AGAIN.\nVENZ WAY LN PRESIDENT SAID ON SUNDAY THAT OPEC AND NON-OPEC\nCOUNTRIES WERE CLOSE TO REACHING A DEAL TO STABILIZE OIL MARKETS\nAND HE AIMED FOR A DEAL THIS MONTH.\nTHAT'S ALWAYS PART ONE OF THE RUMOR.\nA STATEMENT FROM THE MAN WHO NEEDS OIL TO GO HIGHER MORE THAN\nANY 0 LEADER IN THE WORLD, THE PRESIDENT OF VENEZUELA, WHOSE\nCOUNTRY IS FALLING APART BEFORE OUR VERY EYES.\nNEXT WE NEED A CALL TO ACTION FROM SOMEONE ELSE BESIDES THE\nTOTALLY LACKING CREDIBILITY VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT.\nSURE ENOUGH WHO WEIGHS IN RIGHT ON CUE?\nIN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH OF THE STORY, OPEC'S SECRETARY GENERAL,\nWHO GETS QUOTED AS SAYING, AND I QUOTE, OPEC MEMBERS MAY CALL AN\nEXTRAORDINARY MEETING TO DISCUSS OIL PRICES IF THEY REACH\nCONSENSUS AT AN INFORMAL GATHER IN ALGIERS THIS MONTH.\nWAIT A SECOND. THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.\nWE NEED ONE MORE THING. WE NEED ANOTHER PARTY THAT MIGHT\nBE ABLE TO TALK CUTBACK. SURE ENOUGH, GUESS WHO WAS AT\nTHE NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT SUMMIT AT MARGARITA ISLAND, WHICH BY\nTHIS TIME IS TURNING INTO MARGARITAVILLE FOR THE\nPRODUCERS, NONE ON THAT THE IRANIAN PRESIDENT, ANOTHER MAN\nWHO DESPERATELY NEEDS OIL TO GO HIGHER.\nROUHANI MADE IT CLEAR THAT TEHRAN SUPPORTS ANY MOVE TO\nSTABILIZE THE GLOBAL OIL MARKET AND LIFT PRICES.\nNOW, FINALLY WE NEED -- WHAT DO WE NEED?\nWE GOT THE GUY CALL, WE GOT A SECOND GUY.\nWE GOT A THIRD. WE NEED A VENUE.\nWE GOT THAT TOO. WITH A WELL-TIMED QUOTE AT THE\nEND OF THE ARTS CAL. OPEC MEMBERS WILL MEET ON THE\nSIDELINES OF THE INTERNATIONAL ENERGY FORUM WHICH GROUPS\nPRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS IN ALGERIA FROM SEPTEMBER 26th TO\nSEPTEMBER 28th. LET'S SEE.\nNOW WE'VE GOT VENEZUELA ON RECORD WANTING SOMETHING GOOD TO\nHAPPEN WITH OIL PRICES, SAME WITH IRAN.\nTHE FORMULA TO GET OIL UP NEEDS A BIG -- SURE ENOUGH, THIS STORY\nHAS EVERYTHING. NON-OPEC PRODUCER RUSSIA IS ALSO\nATTENDING THE FORUM, END QUOTE. VOILA.\nTHERE WE GO. OIL HEADS RIGHT BACK UP ON THE\nNEWS, RAMPING 90 CREPTS, TAKE THE DOW JONES AVERAGE RIGHT UP\nTRIPLE DIGITS AT THE OPENING. USUAL ALGORITHMS SAY IF YOU\nTHINK OIL IS GOING HIGHER, BUY STOCKS.\nMAYBE THE MARKET IS GETTING A LITTLE SMARTER.\nSTILL WE HAVE TO ASK HOW COME THIS KNEE JERK RALLYING KEEPS\nHAPPENING? THAT'S SIMPLE.\nTHE NATIONS INVOLVED, EVERYONE THAT I JUST MENTIONED ALL WANT\nOIL TO GO HIGHER BUT NOBODY WANTS TO CUT BACK PRODUCTION AND\nRISK LOSING MARKET SHARE TO THE U.S., WHICH IS READY TO TAKE\nADVANTAGE OF ANY PRODUCTION FREEZE THAT RAISES PRICE.\nSO THEY GO THROUGH THE CHARADE. THE OIL MARKET BUYS INTO IT AND\nTHEY GET THE JOB DONE. ONCE AGAIN, WITHOUT EVER REALLY\nHAVING TO CUT PRODUCTION, AND EVERYBODY SWALLOWS IT FROM THE\nJOURNALISTS TO THE STOCK TRADERS TO THE FUTURES TRADERS IN THE\nOIL PIT. ACCORDING TO MY COUNT, THIS IS\nTHE SIXTH TIME THIS GAME HAS PLAYED OUT ALREADY THIS YEAR.\nSIX! IT USUALLY WORKS LIKE A CHARM\nUNTIL WE RUN INTO AN UNMOVEABLE OBJECT LIKE WEDNESDAY'S ACTUAL\nPHYSICAL OIL INVENTORY NUMBER OR, GET THIS, THE REAL OPEC\nMEETING THAT COMES AND GOES WITH NO RESULTS WHATSOEVER, WHICH\nALWAYS SEEMS TO BE THE CASE ANYWAY.\nTHIS KIND OF RUMOR MONGERING STILL DOES EXACTLY WHAT THE\nWORLD'S OIL MINISTERS WANT.

YOU HAD A VERY AGGRESSIVE,\nSHARP, FLAT ANYTHING OF THE YIELD CURVE WITH FINANCIAL\nSTOCKS, IF PARTICULAR. SO I THINK THAT POLICY\nEXPERIMENT, IT HAS PROVED CHALLENGING.\nI'M NOT SURE I WOULD PROVE MONETARY POLICY IS OFF THE BACK\nOF THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS WE MAY WELL\nGET THIS WEEK FROM THE BANK OF JAPAN IS ANOTHER CUT IN TERMS OF\nINTEREST RATES FOR THE NEGATIVE TERRITORY.\nBUT AT THE SAME TIME, AND THIS IS WHAT IS INTERESTING FOR ME\nCOMING OUT OF THE CENTRAL BANK IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS, WE HAVE A\nCENTRAL BANK EXPLICITLY STATING SOMETHING DIFFERENT WHICH IS\nUNUSUAL. AND IT WILL GET ANCHORED FURTHER\nINTO NEGATIVE TERRITORY, BUT IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT\nTHEY DO TO HOLD UP THE LONG END. ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS OUT THERE\nIS THAT WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE COMMITMENT TO FISCAL\nSUPPORT. SO MAYBE NOT OFFICIAL\nRECOGNITION OF HELICOPTER MONEY AS SUCH BUT SOMETHING CLOSER TO\nTHAT. AND THAT, IN TURN, IS GIVING\nJAPAN BOTH THE SHORT-TERM EASE WITH SHORT-TERM RATES COMING UP,\nBUT ALSO A STEEPER YIELD CURVE TO HELP THE FINANCIALS, IN\nPARTICULAR. >> HOW DO YOU THINK THAT'S GOING\nTO PLAY OUT IN TERMS OF ANTICIPATED MONEY FLOW?\nAND HOW IS IT GOING TO PLAY OUT FOR THE UK AS WELL, IF WE DO SEE\nTHE STEEPENING IN. >> FRANKLY, WHERE WE SIT TODAY\nON MONDAY WITH THE NEXT FED MEETING IN A COUPLE DAYS, IT IS\nQUITE UNCERTAIN WHAT WE GET FROM THE BANK OF JAPAN.\nTHERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DIVIDE ON THE BOARD ITSELF, WHICH IS\nCOMPLICATED OR PROPAGATED MATTERS TO MAKE IT HARDER TO\nREAD. NOW IN OUR PORTFOLIOS WE ARE\nLONG JAPANESE EQUITIES, WE SEE THEM SLOWLY IMPROVING, BUT WE\nALSO ARE WATCHING CORPORATE GOVERNORS, ALL OF THAT.\nSO WE LIKE JAPANESE EQUITIES, BUT WE ALSO HAVE BEEN WATCHING\nTHE GENERAL ALONGSIDE THAT POSITION, WHICH HAS BEEN QUITE\nHELPFUL. >> AND THAT EXTRAORDINARY RUN IN\nTHE YEN NEAR 100, 125 OR SO -- >> AND THEN ALL THE WAY BACK\nDOWN. >> YES.\nIF WE SEE A MOVE FROM THE FED AND SEE DOLLAR REPOSITIONING, IS\nTHAT TREND GOING TO START -- HOW MUCH IS THAT GOING TO PLAY\nAGAINST WHAT THE BANK OF JAPAN IS DOING?\n>> THE YEN IS REALLY TRICKY TO CALM.\nBECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND YOU HAVE A VERY CHEAP CURRENCY, YOU HAVE\nAN ACCOUNT SURPLUS, BOTH OF WHICH ARE HELPFUL FOR THE\nCURRENCY, BUT AGAINST THAT YOU HAVE THE PROSPECT.\nAND AT THE MOMENT IT'S THE PROSPECT OF A REGIME SHIFT IN\nJAPAN AND HOW JAPANESE POLICY IS RUN.\nAND THAT IS THE SUPPORT THAT IS THE OPPOSITE.\nTHE DOLLAR/YEN IS UP TO 120 OR 140 WHERE YOU GET OFFICIAL\nHELICOPTER MONEY. BUT I SUPPOSE OUR BASE FEES STAY\nCLOSER TO WHERE WE ARE NEAR 100 AND 102.\nBECAUSE THE BALANCE OF OTHER FORCES DOES SUPPORT A YEN\nSTRONGER. AND ON THE FED, IF WE ARE QUITE\nSKEPTICAL THAT YOU WILL GET A RATE HIKE THIS WEEK FROM THE\nFED, IT WILL MOST LIKELY HAPPEN IN DECEMBER, SO I'M NOT SURE YOU\nGET THE DOLLAR LEG SUPPORTING HIGHER IN THE DOLLAR/YEN EITHER.\n>> ON FRIDAY GOLDMAN DOWNGRADED THE EQUITY BOND TO NEUTRAL, BUT\nSPECIFICALLY ON EUROPE, WHERE DO YOU STAND?\n>> SO WE ARE NEUTRAL EUROPEAN EQUITIES OVERALL.\nWE FAVORED EUROPEAN EQUITIES BUT IN EARLY JULY WE DOWNGRADED\nEQUITIES OVERALL. AT THE SAME TIME, WE SORT OF\nREDUCED OUR REGIONAL SECONDS, WE OVERWEIGHT THE UK AND PULLED\nBOTH OF THOSE BACK INTO THE UNDER EMERGING MARKETS IN THE\nU.S. WE ARE BROADLY NEUTRAL OF\nEUROPEAN EQUITIES HERE, BUT SOME OF THE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE LAST\nFEW MONTHS ARE MORE POSITIVE FOR EUROPE.\nAND IN PARTICULAR, WE HAVE THE CENTRAL BANK EASING.\nBUT WE ALSO HAD A SHARP CONTRACTION IN FED WITH\nCORPORATE BORROWING COSTS. THAT COULD BE QUITE HELPFUL FOR\nEUROPEAN COMPANIES IN THE MONTHS AHEAD.\nSO WE'RE EXPECTING EARNINGS OF ABOUT 5% TO 10% NEXT YEAR IN\nEUROPE, WHICH I BELIEVE IS SLIGHTLY AHEAD.\n>> MAYA, PLEASURE TO SPEAK TO YOU.\nTHE MULTIASSET MANAGER AT THREADNEEDLE INVESTMENTS.\nSEND US YOUR E-MAIL, LET US KNOW WHAT THE BIG EVENT IS FOR YOU\nTHIS WEEK.

YOU SAID EARLIER WE'RE SCRAPING\nTHE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL. WE ARE SCRAPING THE BOTTOM OF\nTHE JAM JAR, IF WE CAN GET ENOUGH JAM FOR A CRUMPET BUT NOT\nFOR A MEAL. >> THAT'S A GREAT BRITISH\nANALOGY THERE. >> WE ARE WORKING HARD TO KEEP\nTHE BRITISH THEME GOING THIS MORNING.\nBUT THE KEY THING FOR ME IS THE SENSE OF THE TEN-YEAR U.S.\nTREASURY YIELDS GOING TO BE HEADING UP TOWARDS 2% OR\nCERTAINLY BACK TOWARDS 1.5%. AND I THINK THAT ANYTHING THE\nFED RESERVE DOES, WHICH MAKES IT CLEAR THAT, YEAH, WE'RE STILL\nGOING HIGHER, YEAH, AS OF THE CENTRAL BANK RUNNING OUT OF\nAMMUNITION, WE THINK THE MARKETS SHOULD BE PRICING IN A MOVE IN\nDECEMBER. I THINK THAT KEEPS BOND MARKETS\nON THE BACK FOOT AND THAT IS WHERE THE DANGER IS FOR RISK\nSENTIMENT RIGHT ACROSS THE WORLD.\n>> IS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT THE FED JUST DOES IT, JUST RAISES\nRATES AND SAYS, YES, THERE IS A TREND WITH IT WEAKENING A BIT,\nBUT THEY ARE STILL POINTING TO A HEALTHY RECOVERY WITH INFLATION\nMOVING TO THE TARGET. UP EMPLOYMENT CONTINUES TO\nIMPROVE AND WE'RE GOING TO RAISE RATES.\n>> YEAH, THE LAST TIME THE FED REALLY SURPRISED MARKETS BY\nRAISING RATES WHEN IT WASN'T EXPECTED WAS IN 1994.\nBUT EVER SINCE THEN IT'S KIND OF BEEN RECEIVED WISDOM FOR FOLKS\nLIKE ME THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO DO THAT AGAIN.\nBUT THIS IS THE MOST CAUTIOUS FOMC SINCE THEN FOR SURE,\nPOSSIBLY FOR EVEN LONGER, I DON'T KNOW.\nSO INCREDIBLY CAUTIOUS. I THINK IT IS MORE LIKELY THAT\nTHEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MARKET IS READY FOR THEM TO\nMOVE, IF THE DANGER IN THE NEXT SIX WEEKS ARE FINE, AND TO GO\nAGAIN BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR RATHER THAN RISK THE REACTION OF\nGOING WHEN THEY HAVEN'T GOT THE MARKET IN THE RIGHT PLACE.\nBUT THIS IS ALL GUESSING AT THIS POINT IN TIME IN TERMS OF THAT.\nBUT IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT IS MORE LIKELY.\n>> KIT, WE HAVE SEEN YIELDS TICK UP ALTHOUGH EXPECTATIONS OF A\nRATE HIKE HAVE BEEN PUSHED BACK, WHAT LEVEL OF YIELDS HAVE WE HIT\nFOR EXAMPLE IN THE TEN-YEAR WOULD YOU START TO GET SERIOUSLY\nWORRIED ON THAT THIS WAS THE BURSTING OF THE BOND BUBBLE IN\nTHE RECENT YEARS? >> WELL, I THINK YOU WOULD HAVE\nTO GET WELL ON THE SIDE OF 2%. IN A SENSE, IT'S NOT -- IT'S NOT\nSO MUCH BURSTING A BUBBLE AT THIS POINT IN TIME, IT'S FATIGUE\nTHAT -- WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO OWN GOVERNMENT BONDS ANYWHERE\nWITH NEGATIVE YIELDS INSTEAD OF PUTTING YOUR MONEY IN CASH?\nWHAT CAN CENTRAL BANKS DO IF WE KNOW THEY WOULD LIKE STEEPER\nYIELD CURVES TO KEEP THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM VIABLE?\nTHOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS WE ASK AROUND.\nGENERALLY, WE SEE THAT THE SUPPORT FOR GLOBAL BOND MARKETS\nIS FADING A LITTLE BIT. IF WHAT WE DO, WE HAVE SEEN THE\nLOW IN TREASURY YIELDS AND THE TEN-YEAR YIELD IS, SOMEWHERE AT\nONE POINT, SOMEWHERE BELOW 2%. BIG DEAL.\nIT'S AN OVERSHOOT SPIKE SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE THAT THAT\nWOULD HAVE MUCH MORE COLLATERAL DAMAGE.\nBUT I DON'T SEE A BIG BEAR MARKET IN BONDS.\nI JUST THINK WE HAVE SEEN THE LOW IN YIELDS FOR QUITE A LONG\nTIME. >> WHAT ABOUT THE DOLLAR?\nWHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE DOLLAR, ARE YOU BUYING IT INTO THE FED\nMEETING WHETHER OR NOT THEY RAISE RATES SEPTEMBER, DECEMBER\nOR MAYBE EARLY NEXT YEAR? >> YEAH, I THINK THE DOLLAR,\nWHICH HAS BEEN LARGELY MOVING SIDEWALKS AGAINST THE EURO AND\nYEN FOR MONTHS NOW, WHICH HAS LOST GROUND OVER THE SUMMER, ALL\nTHOSE LAZY, THOSE COMFORTABLE EASY CARRY TRADES THAT WE SAW AS\nPEOPLE WERE HUNTING YIELD OVER THE SUMMER.\nI THINK WE CAN STILL UNWIND MORE OF THAT IF MARKETS ARE\nENCOURAGED TO PRICE IN A RATE HIKE DOWN THE ROAD WITH MORE\nCONVICTION. I THINK THOSE TRENDS CAN BE\nTAKEN OFF AS PEOPLE TAKE BETS OFF.\nA MUCH SHARPER DOLLAR MOVE SEEMS UNLIKELY AT THIS POINT, WE'RE\nNOT -- WE'RE FINE-TUNING A FED STORY AND WE'RE TRYING TO COPE\nWITH THE END OF THE CYCLE IN MONETARY POLICY OVER THE BANK OF\nJAPAN. >> KIT, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US\nTHIS MORNING.

AND AHEAD OF A VERY BIG CENTRAL\nBANK DECISION FROM THE FED, JOINING US FROM CHARLOTTE IS\nJOHN SILVIA AT WELLS FARGO SECURITY.\nGOOD MORNING TO YOU, JOHN. >> Reporter: GOOD MORNING.\n>> IS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT THE FED COULD PULL A RATE HIKE\nSURPRISE THIS WEEK? >> A VERY SMALL CHANCE.\nI THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION AND RETAIL\nSALES NUMBERS LAST WEEK, THEY WERE KIND OF DISAPPOINTING.\nTHIS WEEK WE SEE BETTER HOUSING DATA.\nAND OVERALL, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OVERALL FLOW OF THE ECONOMY,\nDOMESTIC SALES IS PRETTY GOOD. INFLATION IS CREEPING UP.\nBUT THERE IS REALLY NO INCENTIVE TO MOVE QUITE YET, ESPECIALLY IN\nFRONT OF AN ELECTION. >> JOHN, WHAT CAN WE EXPECT THEN\nIN TERMS OF MARKETS BETWEEN NOW AND SAY DECEMBER, THE NEXT\nMEETING WHEN THIS WILL BE A QUESTION AGAIN?\nBECAUSE WE SAW A LOT OF ROTATION IN THE SUMMER EXPECTING A HIKE,\nAND NOW THAT IS A DRAWN LINE AGAIN.\n>> YEAH, THAT IS ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF BEING SO DATA\nDEPENDENT ON SHORT-RUN DATA. SO YOU GET THIS ROLLER COASTER\nOF VOLATILITY AS SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY, BUT THAT WOULD BE MY\nEXPECTATION IN THE MARKETPLACE FOR THE REST OF THIS YEAR.\nPLUS, THE SENSE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET SLIGHTLY BETTER\nECONOMIC DATA THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.\nSO MAYBE TEN-YEAR YIELDS MOVE UP A LITTLE BIT.\nAND THEN FINALLY BEYOND THE FED, LOOK AT THE BANK OF JAPAN THIS\nWEEK. YOU PROBABLY KNOW RATE CHANGE.\nI THINK THAT THERE'S A SENTIMENT THAT NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES AND\nRATE CHANGES AREN'T GOING TO DO IT.\nBUT THERE MAY BE MORE BOND PURCHASES IN THE FUTURE OR ETF\nFUTURES PERHAPS IN THE FUTURE BY THE BANK OF JAPAN.\nTHAT MAY INFLUENCE MARKETS. BUT I THINK YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT,\nA LOT OF THE VOLATILITY IN THE MARKETPLACE THROUGHOUT THE REST\nOF THE YEAR. AGAIN, IN RESPECT TO AND IN\nADDITION TO THE ELECTION. >> I WAS JUST GOING TO ASK ABOUT\nTHAT WITH 50 DAYS TO GO, JOHN, HOW YOU THINK THE RECENT SURGE\nIN MOMENTUM OF DONALD TRUMP AS A FRONT-RUNNER IN THE PRESIDENTIAL\nELECTION WILL IMPACT THE MARKET AND THE ECONOMY INTO THE\nELECTION. >> WELL, I WOULD SAY ANTICIPATE\nCHANGE. FOR HILLARY, THERE'S PROBABLY A\nLITTLE BIT OF A CONTINUATION, TO SOME EXTENT, PRESIDENT OBAMA'S\nPOLICIES. BUT WHENEVER WE HAVE A CHANGE IN\nPOLICY, I THINK ANALYSTS, ECONOMISTS LIKE MYSELF, FIXED\nANALYSTS, THEY STEP BACK TO SAY, WHAT ARE THE REASONABLE POLICY\nCHANGE THAT IS CAN BE PUT IN PLACE THAT WILL CHANGE OUR\nEXPECTED FUTURE PATH FOR EITHER INTEREST RATES AND/OR CORPORATE\nPROFITS. AND I THINK CHANGE IS THE BIG\nSTORY. WE NEED TO TAKE IT INTO OUR\nCALCULUS IN TERMS OF THE GATHERING MOMENTUM FOR DONALD\nTRUMP AT THIS POINT. >> JOHN, EITHER WAY, BOTH THE\nCANDIDATES ARE TALKING ABOUT SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE\nSPENDING AND FISCAL POLICY STIMULUS.\nIS THAT SOMETHING THAT MEANS ONCE WE GET OVER THIS\nUNCERTAINTY IN TERMS OF WHO THE CANDIDATE WILL BE, THE PRESIDENT\nWILL BE, THAT IF EITHER OF THEM DELIVERS A FISCAL POLICY\nSTIMULUS THAT THE ECONOMY SHOULD PICK UP SIGNIFICANTLY NEXT YEAR?\n>> YEAH, I THINK THERE ARE TWO LINES OF THINKING HERE.\nONE, OVER THE LAST THREE TO FIVE YEARS, IT'S BECOME MORE AND MORE\nAPPARENT TO PEOPLE THAT WE NEED SOME FISCAL STIMULUS.\nTHE MONETARY POLICY CAN ONLY GO SO FAR.\nAND I THINK A SECOND ASPECT IS, YES, SOME INFRASTRUCTURE\nSPENDING WELL THOUGHT OUT, NOT JUST SPEND MONEY, BUT LOOK AT\nTHE BENEFIT COST ANALYSIS, WILL ADD TO ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE\nNEXT YEAR OR TWO. CERTAINLY IN SOME MORE\nINDUSTRIAL AREAS, AREAS THAT HAVEN'T REALLY PARTICIPATE IN\nTHE OVERALL GROWTH OF THE ECONOMY.\n>> YEAH, I MEAN, IT DEPENDS ON WHAT HAPPENS WITH CONGRESS AND\nWHETHER THEY WILL EVEN PASS THAT AND WHO GETS THAT.\nBUT JOHN, QUICKLY, THIS WEEK WE HAVE A LOT OF HOUSING DATA.\nQUICKLY, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT? >> CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT.\nCONTINUED SENSE THAT BETTER JOB GROWTH, LOW INTEREST RATES\nREALLY HELP THE HOUSING MARKET OVERALL FOR THE ECONOMY.\n>> ALL RIGHT. WE'LL SEE WHAT THE NUMBERS SHOW\nSTARTING WITH THE SURVEY OF HOME BUILDERS TODAY.\nJOHN SILVIA, THANK YOU. >> QUICKLY, WHAT ARE YOU\nWATCHING? >> TECH BECAUSE THAT WAS THE\nOUTPERFORMER LAST WEEK. WE SAW THE TECH MARKET JUMP\nOVERNIGHT WITH APPLE STILL RIDING THE WAVE.\n>> I'M WATCHING THE BANKS. WELLS FARGO WAS THE WORST\nPERFORMER LAST WEEK.

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN APPLE'S\nONE YEAR PERFORMANCE AND THE S&P PERFORMANCE, AND THE OTHER THING\nIS IT'S A CHEAP STOCK AS EVERYBODY REMINDS YOU AND YET IT\nHAS KIND OF A HIT DRIVEN BUSINESS AND BASICALLY OPERATES\nBY GROWTH COMPANY RULES. IT'S RARE TO SEE AN ENORMOUS\nCOMPANY THAT EVERY YEAR HAS TO WOW THE WORLD.\nI THINK THAT ACCOUNTS FOR A LOT OF THE DEPRESSURED VALUATION.\nAND THEN THE LEGION OF STEADY FANS OUT THERE IN THE WORLD, AND\nALSO UNDER OWNED, AND I THINK THAT'S BEHIND WHAT THE LATEST\nMOVE IS ABOUT. YOU HAD THEM SELL DOWN THE STOCK\nIN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR, AND THE TOP THREE HOLDERS OF\nRECORD ARE INDEX FUND MANAGERS AND IT SEEMS AS IF IT WAS THE\nPASSIVE HOLDER'S HANDS. YOU HAVE TO OWN SOME.\nTHAT'S WHY IT'S A BIT OF A MISFIT AND RUNS IN THE STREETS.\nIT HAS HAD 20 OR 30% MOVES ABOVE AND BELOW THE STARTING POINT.\n>> MIKE, STICK AROUND. WE WILL TALK MORE ABOUT THAT.\nBUT THE REASON DAVID IS HERE TODAY IS TALKING ABOUT A NEW\nSECTOR S&P IS ADDING TODAY. 28 REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS\nTHAT USED TO FALL UNDER FINANCIALS AND THEY WILL BECOME\nTHE NEW REAL ESTATE SECTOR. AND JOINING US TO TALK ABOUT\nTHAT MOVE IS DAVID BLITZER. DAVID, THIS IS UNUSUAL.\nTEN SECTORS WE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING FOR A LONG TIME AND\nYOU ARE ADDING AN 11th, AND WHY BREAK OUT REAL ESTATE?\n>> WELL, I THINK TWO OR THREE THINGS HAPPENED.\nREAL ESTATE USED TO BE TUCKED INTO FINANCIALS AND REAL ESTATE\nESPECIALLY READS DON'T BEHAVE THE SAME WAY FINANCIALS DO AT\nALL. BECAUSE THEY HAVE BETTER\nDIVIDENDS, ABOUT ONE-THIRD LARGER THAN FINANCIALS AND THE\nYIELD WILL GO DOWN ABOUT A QUARTER OF A POINT BECAUSE OF\nTHE CHANGE. SECOND OF ALL REAL ESTATE RATES\nHAVE BECOME MORE POPULAR OVER THE LAST 16 YEARS SINCE WE\nCREATED -- >> THE GLOBAL STANDARD.\n>> IT WAS CREATED TO USE WITH ALL OF THE MCI USES IT WITH\nTHEIRS SOERBGS WE CAN ANALYZE AND FOLLOW THE MARKET, AND WE\nCAN FIND OUT WHICH SECTOR IS NOT MOVING BECAUSE APPLE IS NOT IN\nIT AND ALL THOSE OTHER ISSUES. >> THERE'S A WARNING ABOUT NEW\nBUBBLES CREATED BY THE FED'S NEW RATE POLICY.\nIS THAT SOMETHING THAT COMES AS A RISK IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT\nTHIS AS A SECTOR, HOW BUBBLISHOUS DOES IT FEEL?\n>> ONE OF THE THING ONE CAN DO IS USE THE NEW SECTOR TO TRACK\nTHAT SECTOR OF THE MARKET AND SEE IF THEY ARE OUT OF LINE.\nHAD WE HAD A CLEAR TECHNOLOGY SECTOR BACK IN THE 1990s, WE\nPROBABLY WOULD HAVE SEEN IT GO TO THE MOON, AND WE WERE\nTRACKING THE PROPORTION OF TECH STOCKS AND WE KNEW WE WENT 15%\nTO 16% TO ONE-THIRD OF THE INDEX BY 2000.\n>> WOULD WE BE ABLE TO LOOK BACK AT HISTORICAL IF THERE HAD BEEN\nTHIS SECTOR IN PARTICULAR AND WE COULD SEE WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER\nTHE LAST TEN YEARS? >> NOT AT THIS POINT THERE'S NOT\nAN OFFICIAL REAL ESTATE SECTOR HISTORY, HOWEVER ONE GOES INTO\nGICS IN ONE LEVEL DETAIL, AND ONE CAN PULL OUT THE REAL ESTATE\nBY LOOKING AT THE EIGHT-DIGIT CODES AND TAKE A LOOK AT THAT.\nWHAT WE SEE IS THE FIRST READ IN THE 500 WAS OCTOBER OF 2001, AND\nTHEY HAVE GROWN VERY RAPIDLY SINCE THEN AND THEY MOVED UP\nBEFORE OCTOBER 2001, AND THERE WERE NO READS AND IT WAS\nPROBABLY DIFFICULT TO BUY REAL ESTATE IN THE EQUITY MARKETS 15\nOR 20 YEARS AGO. >> WHAT WILL AN INVESTOR OR FUND\nTHAT HAS BEEN TRACKING FINANCIALS NOTICE THAT IS\nDIFFERENT IN THEIR PORTFOLIO TODAY DIFFERENTLY?\n>> WELL, FIRST, THEY WILL LOOK AT THE NUMBERS AND THEY WILL SEE\nTHE PERCENTAGE OF FINANCIALS LOOKS SMALLER BY THREE POINTS\nBECAUSE WE PULLED OUT REAL ESTATE.\nSECOND, WHAT THEY MAY NOTICE IN A LOT OF ACTIVITY MANAGED FUNDS,\nLAST WEEK THEY PROBABLY THOUGHT THEY WERE WEIGHTED IN FINANCIALS\nAND THIS WEEK THEY MY FIND OUT THEY ARE UNDER WEIGHTED IN REAL\nESTATE, AND SOME OF THE STORIES WE HEARD IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS\nTHERE ARE A LOT OF ACTIVE FUNDS THAT WILL HAVE TO GO OUT AND BUY\nTO BOOST THEIR REAL ESTATE EXPOSURE, AND IF THAT'S A\nACCURATE CASE, WE WILL FIND OUT OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS.\n>> WHAT IS INTERESTING, DAVID, WHEN YOU SEPARATE THIS OUT YOU\nHAVE WHAT IS NOW THE FINANCIAL SECTOR A GOOD DEAL SMALLER THAN\nTHE COMBINATION OF REAL ESTATE, CONSUMER STAPLES, AND UTILITIES,\nWHICH ARE THE YIELD SECTORS, AND THAT SHOWS YOU THE INDEX AS A\nWHOLE IS KIND OF MORE PERHAPS SENSITIVE TO RISING RATES THAN A\nBENEFICIARY. >> WHAT JUMPED OUT AT YOU?\nWHAT ARE THINGS YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING?\n>> UP UNTIL ABOUT A WEEK AGO, WE HAD VICK SITTING THERE AT 13 OR\n14, AND IT LOOKED LIKE IT DIED AND NOTHING HAPPENED AND WE HAD\nEVERYBODY SORT OF LIKE, WHEN IS SOMETHING GOING TO HAPPEN KIND\nOF STUFF, AND THEN WE HAD VOLATILITY AND I THINK WE ARE IN\nFOR A LOT MORE VOLATILITY, AND THIS WEEK ALONE BETWEEN THE U.N.\nAND EVERYBODY MAKING NOISE AND THEN THE FED ON WEDNESDAY, AND\nEVEN WITHOUT THE UNFORTUNATE NEWS ABOUT THE BOMBING IN\nCHELSEA, AND THIS WEEK COULD BE AN EXCITING WEEK THAT WILL KEEP\nALL OF US BUSY, AND -- >> DO YOU THINK THE VOLATILITY\nIS RELATED TO THE ELECTION AT ALL?\n>> YES, I DO. I THINK IF YOU LOOK BACK AT\nELECTIONS, YOU GET PAST LABOR DAY AND THE RACE ALWAYS TIGHTENS\nUP, NO MATTER WHO WINS, AND IT'S NOT A RECOMMENDATION FOR EITHER\nCANDIDATE, THINGS ALWAYS TIGHTEN UP AND THERE'S A LOT OF NOISE\nAND NEWS MEDIA FOCUSES MORE BECAUSE FOR A LONG TIME IT HAS\nNOT BEEN EXCITING AND IT GETS EXCITING, SO THAT IS DRIVING IT.\nWITH THINGS LIKE THIS WEEKEND IN NEW YORK, THERE WILL BE A LOT\nMORE ATTENTION AS TO WHAT CANDIDATES SAY WHAT SHOULD BE\nDONE NOW AND WHO SCREAMS LOUD WUR.\n>> THANK YOU FOR COMING IN.",

FBI PUTTING OUT A WANTED POSTER\nTHIS MORNING AND THE MANHUNT IS ONGOING AT THIS HOUR.\nTHERE'S ALSO THE SEARCH CONTINUING IN ELIZABETH, NEW\nJERSEY, AT THE FAMILY HOME THERE.\nTHEY WANT TO KNOW IF THAT WAS THE BOMB FACTORY WHERE THE BOMBS\nWERE BUILT OR IF THERE'S ANY  LEAD THEM TO THIS SUSPECT OR TO\nWHERE THE BOMBS WERE BUILT.

FOR THAT WE'LL GO BACK TO SEEMA\nMODY FOR HIGHLIGHTS. >> ONE DAY AHEAD OF A BOJ\nMEETING, THE PRIME MINISTER OF JAPAN SHINZO ABE MAKING THE CASE\nFOR ABENOMICS JAPAN IS USING. >> Translator: THERE'S NO DOUBT\nABENOMICS HAVE IMPROVED JAPAN'S INVESTMENT ENVIRONMENT.\n-- TELL US THAT JAPAN RANKS NUMBER ONE AS A BASE FOR BOTH R\n& D AND MARKETING. >> BUT THE ECONOMIC REALITY THAT\nJAPAN IS FACING IS THAT IT'S DEALING WITH CHRONIC DEFLATION\nAND TEPID GROWTH. IN FACT, THE NOMINAL GDP OF\nJAPAN IN 2015 WAS ROUGHLY THE SAME AS IT WAS 20 YEARS AGO.\nJUST HIGHLIGHTING THE STAGNATION THAT THE WORLD'S THIRD LARGEST\nECONOMY IS DEALING WITH. THAT'S WHY THERE'S SO MUCH FOCUS\nBEING PUT ON THIS CENTRAL BANK MEETING IN JAPAN THAT KICKS OFF\nTOMORROW WHERE THE CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR KURODA IS EXPECTED TO\nUNVEIL FURTHER EASING MEASURES IN AN ATTEMPT TO RESUSCITATE\nJAPAN'S ECONOMY POTENTIALLY LOWERING RATES INTO FURTHER\nNEGATIVE TERRITORY. THERE'S ALSO SOME SPECULATION\nOUT THERE THAT JAPAN MAY ADJUST ITS BOND BUYING PROGRAM.\nTHAT'S WHY WE'RE KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON THE 10-YEAR AND 30-YEAR\nJAPANESE BOND YIELDS. A LOT OF FOCUS ON WHAT\nHARUHIKA KURODA WILL HAVE TO SAY.\nPRIME MINISTER ABE ALSO ADDRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF TPP,\nAND THAT IS LIKELY TO BE THE TOPIC HE DISCUSSES WITH\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HILLARY CLINTON LATER THIS AFTERNOON.\nBACK TO YOU. >> SEEMA, THANK YOU FOR THAT.\nSEEMA MODY WATCHING ABE'S COMMENTS.\nMEANWHILE, THE OFFICIAL COUNTDOWN HAS BEGUN, JUST 50\nDAYS UNTIL THE NOVEMBER 8th PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.\nOUR JOHN HARWOOD JOINS US WITH THE LATEST FROM THE CAMPAIGN\nTRAIL. GOOD MORNING, JOHN.\n>> GOOD MORNING, CARL. START THAT COUNTDOWN CLOCK, 50\nDAYS TO GO. ONE WEEK UNTIL THE FIRST DEBATE,\nWHICH IS REALLY GOING TO TELL THE COUNTRY THAT WE'RE ON THE\nVERGE OF A BIG DECISION. BUT I JUST WANTED TO AS WE BEGIN\nTHE COUNTDOWN TAKE A LOOK AT THE ELECTORAL BATTLEGROUND HERE.\nBECAUSE WE'VE SEEN THE NATIONAL POLLING TIGHTEN, AND THAT HAS AN\nEFFECT WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW THE ELECTORAL VOTES ARE FALLING.\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT WHERE THEY STAND RIGHT NOW, THE NATIONAL\nRACE WITH HILLARY CLINTON JUST A COUPLE POINTS AHEAD OF DONALD\nTRUMP. YOU CAN SEE THAT SHE'S GOT ABOUT\n200 ELECTORAL VOTES THAT ARE SOLIDLY BLUE, THAT ARE LIKELY TO\nBE IN HER COLUMN. DONALD TRUMP HAS GOT 164.\nWHAT THAT LEAVES IS A DOZEN OR SO BATTLEGROUND STATES LEFT TO\nBE CONTESTED. THREE PARTICULAR CLUMPS OF THOSE\nSTATES, THERE'S ONE IN THE MIDWEST MOST PROMISING FOR\nDONALD TRUMP, PENNSYLVANIA, OHIO, IOWA, MICHIGAN, WISCONSIN.\nTHEN THERE'S A CHUNK IN THE SOUTHEAST, VIRGINIA, NORTH\nCAROLINA AND FLORIDA. AND YOU GOT THREE OUT WEST WHERE\nTHE LATINO VOTE'S GOING TO COME IN PLAY IN A VERY BIG WAY,\nARIZONA, NEVADA AND COLORADO. THOSE ARE WHERE THE CANDIDATES\nARE GOING TO INVEST THEIR MONEY, INVEST THEIR TIME, THEIR\nSTRATEGIC RESOURCES IN TERMS OF VOTER TURNOUT AND VOTER\nTARGETING AND IDENTIFICATION. THAT'S WHERE THE THING'S GOING\nTO BE DECIDED 50 DAYS FROM NOW WE'LL KNOW THE ANSWER, GUYS.\n>> JOHN, THANK YOU FOR THAT. AND FOR MORE ON THIS LET'S BRING\nIN FROM WASHINGTON FORMER CRUZ CAMPAIGN SPOKESMAN RICK TYLER\nAND POLITICO ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENT AND CNBC\nCONTRIBUTOR BEN WHITE. GENTLEMEN, GOOD MORNING TO YOU\nBOTH. >> GOOD MORNING.\n>> BEN, ONCE AGAIN WE'RE SORT OF LEFT WITH THE PUZZLE OF WHY THE\nMARKET IS, I WOULDN'T SAY RALLYING, BUT AT LEAST GREEN IN\nTHE FACE OF AN EVENT LIKE WHAT WE SAW OVER THE WEEKEND.\nWHY IS THAT? >> WELL, I WOULD THINK THAT, YOU\nKNOW, THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A CONCERN THAT YOU HAVE AFTER AN\nEVENT LIKE THIS PEOPLE ARE NERVOUS.\nBUT THERE HASN'T BEEN TREMENDOUS DAMAGE FROM IT.\nWE SEEM TO HAVE A TARGET IN MIND, A PERSON WHO IT LOOKS LIKE\nIS BEHIND THESE ATTACKS. AND MY GUESS IS MARKETS ARE\nANTICIPATING THE FED THIS WEEK. THE FED STAYING ON HOLD, NOT\nRAISING INTEREST RATES, THAT'S OBVIOUSLY GOOD FOR MARKETS.\nTHIS IS A DISTURBING EVENT BUT NOT ONE THAT WOULD SHAKE\nMARKETS. THAT'S WHAT WE'VE SEEN SO FAR.\n>> THEN OF COURSE WE HAD THE SECRETARY SPEAK A FEW MOMENTS\nAGO, RICK, IN WHICH SHE RELIES ON AN ARGUMENT BASED ON HER\nEXPERIENCE. I KNOW HOW TO DO THIS.\nI WAS IN THE SITUATION ROOM. OF COURSE THE NATURAL RESPONSE\nIS, WELL, WHAT DO WE HAVE TO SHOW FOR IT AFTER THIS WEEKEND,\nRIGHT? >> YEAH, I THINK THAT'S THE\nCENTRAL ARGUMENT. I WATCHED HER PRESS CONFERENCE\nAND SHE COMPETENTLY DELIVERED A CONFIDENT AND CONFIDENCE MESSAGE\nTHAT IN THESE SITUATIONS SHE'S BEEN THERE BEFORE, SHE'S BEEN IN\nTHE SITUATION ROOM, SHE'S CONTRIBUTED TO DECISION MAKING\nTHAT HAS LED TO THE DEFEAT OF TERRORISM.\nBUT AT THE SAME TIME ISIS REALLY WAS AN OUTGROWTH OF THE ONE\nWOULD ARGUE THE OBAMA/CLINTON FOREIGN POLICY.\nIT DID NOT EXIST BEFORE HILLARY CLINTON WAS SECRETARY OF STATE.\nTHAT'S NOT TO SAY SHE'S ENTIRELY RESPONSIBLE FOR IT, BUT THE\nMIDDLE EAST WHERE TERRORISM HAS EXISTED SHE CERTAINLY WAS AT THE\nHEAD -- SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE DURING THAT TIME.\nI DO THINK THAT SHE DID FOCUS ON RIGHTLY AND HAS NOT BEEN ENOUGH\nIS TO COUNTER THESE PERSUASIVE ONLINE SOCIAL MEDIA NETWORKING\nTHAT ISIS USES VERY EFFECTIVELY. EFFECTIVELY MEDIA COMPANIES\nRECRUITING AND PERSUADING PEOPLE WHO LIKE PERHAPS RAHAMI WILL\nFIND OUT WHETHER THEY WERE PERSUADED BY THOSE KINDS OF\nVIDEOS AND BECAME RADICALIZED HERE IN THE UNITED STATES.\n>> YEAH, THAT INTELLIGENCE SURGE THAT SHE TALKED ABOUT.\nBEN, WE DO HAVE THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE UNITED NATIONS\nHERE IN NEW YORK. IT'S A REMINDER THAT THE U.S.\nRELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER WORLD LEADERS MATTER.\nWHO SHOULD SECRETARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP BE FOCUSED ON WHEN\nIT COMES TO THE FIGHT ON TERROR, WHICH IS NOW FRONT AND CENTER?\n>> RIGHT, WELL, CERTAINLY OUR ALLIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST YOU'LL\nSEE BOTH OF THESE CANDIDATES MEETING WITH THE EGYPTIAN\nLEADERS. AND IT'S, YOU KNOW, ALSO ACROSS\nEUROPE THERE'S REALLY NO ONE AMONG THESE WORLD LEADERS AT THE\nU.N. WHO WOULD NOT BE BENEFICIAL FOR THESE PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATES TO MEET WITH TO TALK ABOUT OUR EFFORTS TO FIGHT\nTERRORISM BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND ABROAD.\nBUT IT'S REALLY CRITICAL FOR THEM TO ESTABLISH RELATIONS WITH\nOTHER MIDDLE EASTERN LEADERS WHO ARE OUR PARTNERS IN THE WAR ON\nTERROR AND TRYING TO STOP THESE TYPES OF EVENTS IN THE UNITED\nSTATES. BUT I THINK WHAT THIS SHOWS US\nTHESE BOMBINGS IN NEW YORK IS THAT THIS IS AN UNSETTLED\nPRESIDENTIAL RACE THAT IS SUBJECT TO OUTSIDE SHOCKS FROM\nHERE ON OUT. YOU KNOW, DONALD TRUMP'S\nCAMPAIGN IS BASED IN PART ON A MESSAGE OF CRACKING DOWN ON\nIMMIGRATION, IF IT TURNS OUT THIS WAS INDEED AN AFGHANI WHO\nIMMIGRATED TO THE UNITED STATES FAIRLY OR UNFAIRLY, THAT PLAYS\nINTO THE TRUMP NARRATIVE THAT WE HAVE TO BE TOUGHER AND CRACK\nDOWN HARDER. I THINK SECRETARY CLINTON DID A\nFINE JOB IN HER PRESS CONFERENCE, BUT SHE WAS SLIGHTLY\nON THE DEFENSIVE THERE WITH QUESTIONS SAYING DOESN'T THIS\nPLAY INTO DONALD TRUMP'S NARRATIVE AND MESSAGE?\nAND TO A DEGREE I THINK IT DOES, AND THESE THINGS WILL CONTINUE\nTO PLAY OUT AND DEBATES WILL BE CRITICAL.\nBUT WE HAVE AN UNSTABLE AND VERY CLOSE PRESIDENTIAL RACE SUBJECT\nTO OUTSIDE INFLUENCE. >> YEAH.\nIT'S TRUE. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT\nBIRTHER CONTROVERSY OR THAT ECONOMIC SPEECH FROM LITERALLY\nJUST DAYS AGO. GUYS, WE HAVE TO CUT IT SHORT\nTODAY. BUSY DAY AS YOU UNDERSTAND.\nTHANKS SO MUCH BEN WHITE AND",

HE LET'S TRY AND PIVOT FROM WHAT\nHAPPENED OVER THE WEEKEND AND THE NEWS OF THE ARREST TO THE\nNEWS OF THE WEEK WHEN IT COMES TO INVESTORS, THE MARKET, AND I\nKNOW WHAT ALL OF YOU ARE FOCUSED ON AS WELL.\nWHAT DO YOU EXPECT THIS WEEK? >> I EXPECT HAWKISH LANGUAGE.\nI THINK SOME OF THE RISE IN FINANCIALS IN THE LAST COUPLE OF\nWEEKS, WHETHER YOU WANT TO STAY WITH THE FINANCIALS OR NOT,\nWE'LL GET INTO THAT IN A MINUTE, BUT I THINK SOME OF THE\nAPPRECIATION IS ATRIT OUTABLE TO THE FACT THAT WE EXPECT THE\nFEDERAL RESERVE NOT TO DO ANYTHING AT THIS MEETING, BUT TO\nTALK ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO AND INDICATE TO THE\nMARKETS THAT THEY WILL BE DOING SOMETHING IN DECEMBER.\nLET ME ALSO JUST SAY I THINK IT WAS VERY SURPRISING LAST NIGHT\nWHEN YOU TURNED ON THE SCREEN AT 6:00 AND YOU SAW THE S&P EIGHT\nHANDLES HIGHER. I THINK THAT'S JUST INDICATIVE\nOF THE ENVIRONMENT THAT'S SO DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND RIGHT\nNOW. >> YOU WOULD HAVE EXPECTED OR\nUNDERSTOOD IF THE MARKET HAD A MORE NEGATIVE VIEW.\n>> ESPECIALLY HEARING THE PRICE ACTION LAST WEEK AND WHERE WE\nWENT OUT ON FRIDAY. IT WAS AN UGLY DAY.\n>> KEVIN O'LEARY, I KNOW YOU ARE WITH US FROM L.A.\nTHANKS FOR BEING HERE TODAY. WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?\nWHAT ARE YOU DOING IN ADVANCE OF WHAT THE FED MAY OR MAY NOT DO\nCOME MIDDLE OF THE WEEK? >> SO I'M TRIMMING FINANCIALS.\nI KIND OF AGREE WITH JOE. THIS WILL BE THE -- IF WE DON'T\nGET -- I ASSUME NO RATE HIKE IN SEPTEMBER, BUT I THINK BAKED IN\nIS 25 BASIS POINTS IN DECEMBER. IF THAT DOESN'T APPEAR, IT WILL\nBE THE FIFTH HEAD FAKE IN THIS CYCLE.\nTHOSE THAT ARE LONG WITH ANTICIPATION AND IT'S FINALLY\nTIED FOR FINANCIALS TO PERFORM, THEY ARE GOING TO LOSE 4% TO\n10%. JUST LIKE THEY DID FOUR TIMES IN\nA ROW. IT JUST MAY BE THAT WE'RE IN A\nPERPETUAL LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT, AND THIS IS A\nSECTOR THAT IS JUST GOING TO CONTINUE TO FIBULATE.\nIT'S A NASTY LITTLE SECTOR. I WOULDN'T BE LONG HERE.\nYOU COULD REALLY LOSE SOME MONEY.\n>> YEAH. THERE'S SOME INTERESTING TRADES\nTO THINK ABOUT, JIM, WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE FED MAY OR MAY\nNOT DO, AND FINANCIALS HAVE BEEN KIND OF THE PLACE TO BE IF YOU\nTHOUGHT RATES WERE GOING TO GO UP AND MAYBE NOW IS THE TIME TO\nWORRY ABOUT THAT TRADE IN CASE THEY DON'T MOVE AT ALL.\n>> WELL, I THINK IF YOU ARE IN FINANCIALS BECAUSE YOU ARE\nEXPECTING A RATE HIKE ON WEDNESDAY, YOU HAVE GOT THE\nWRONG TRADE ON. I DON'T COMPLETELY AGREE WITH\nKEVIN. I DO THINK THAT FINANCIALS HAVE\nHAD A VERY NICE RUN OFF OF THE FEBRUARY LOWS, AND THEY MAY HAVE\nA LITTLE MORE IN THEM. I JUST DON'T THINK THAT ANYBODY\nRIGHT NOW IS PRICING IN A RATE HIKE ON WEDNESDAY, SO IF IT\nDOESN'T HAPPEN, I'M NOT SURE I SEE THAT 4% SELL-OFF IN THE XLF.\n>> THE BIG DEAL OF WHETHER IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN OR NOT, LET'S\nBRING IN FORMER FED INSIDER RICHARD FISHER.\nHE, OF COURSE, THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE\nBANK OF DALLAS. RICHARD, IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU\nON THE HALFTIME SHOW. WELCOME.\n>> THANKS. >> LET ME GET YOUR OPINION HERE.\nWHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THIS WEEK?\nDOES THE FED MOVE OR NOT? >> I THINK JOE NAILED IT.\nTHEY'LL PROBABLY CHANGE THE LANGUAGE.\nWITH REGARD TO THE FOOTBALLS. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE\nPOLICY THAT THEY'VE PURSUED IS THEY'VE BEEN GUTTING THE BANKS,\nTHE NET INTEREST MARGINS ARE NIL.\nINSURANCE COMPANIES. STATE PENSION FUNDS.\nOTHER FORMS OF SAVINGS FORMATS ARE REALLY BEGINNING TO FEEL\nTHREATENED AND ARE IN NEED OF SOME RELIEF.\nHAVING SAID ALL THAT, I DO EXPECT THEM TO CONTINUE TO\nEMPHASIZE THE FACT THEY'RE GOING TO REINVEST THE SYSTEM OPEN\nMARKET ACCOUNT PORTFOLIO. THEY HAVE 1.1 TRILLION MATURING\nBETWEEN 2016 AND 2019. THE REAL KEY TO MONETARY\nACCOMMODATION IS WHAT DO THEY DO WHEN THEY ROLL OVER THE\nPORTFOLIO AND REINVEST, AND THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE 35% OF ALL\nTREASURIES BEYOND A FIVE-YEAR MATURITY, THEY HAVE A LOT TO\nPLAY WITH. >> MAYBE RICHARD THEY NEED TO\nRETHINK THE WHOLE THING AS FORMER FED CHAIR BEN BERNANKE\nWROTE IN HIS MOST RECENT LOG. MAYBE AS HE SAID YOU CAN'T GO\nHOME AGAIN. MAYBE THEY NEED TO RETHINK THE\nENTIRE EXIT STRATEGY. THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW MUCH\nDAMAGE THEY'VE DONE TO THE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THE\nBANKS. WE SAW AN ARTICLE IN THE BIG\nGERMAN NEWSPAPER LAST WEEK ABOUT THE THREAT TO THEIR INSURANCE\nINDUSTRY HERE. THESE ARE THE SAVINGS MEDIA THAT\nMOST OF THE PEOPLE, 90% IN THE UNITED STATES, THAT HAVE SOME\nMONEY IN THE BANK, LOOK TO, AND FOR FINANCIAL SECURITY.\nON THE ONE HAND -- I THINK THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE WRONG\nPLACE, BY THE WAY, AT THE FOMC, THE FEDERAL COMMITTEE.\nTHEY HAVE THEIR BLINDERS ON, FOCUSED ON THE TWO CRITERIA.\nEMPLOYMENT. >> IF YOU WERE IN THE ROOM THIS\nWEEK I HEAR YOU SAYING YOU WOULD NOT VOTE TO RAISE RATES, EVEN A\nQUARTER POINT AT THIS MEETING. >> I WOULD ADVOCATE RAISING\nRATES. I DON'T THINK IT DOES MUCH\nDAMAGE IN THE ECONOMY. IT ALSO GIVES BREATHING ROOM TO\nTHOSE KEY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT WE NEED TO BE PROSPEROUS.\nI DON'T THINK THEY'LL DO IT. I WOULD HAVE ARGUED THIS QUITE A\nBIT BECAUSE AS ERIC ROZENGRIN, A DOVISH CHARACTER BUT A GOOD MAN.\nHE IS BEGINNING TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE SUSTAINED\nTHIS FINANCIAL DOUBLE. THERE'S ANOTHER ASPECT.\nTHAT'S A BY-PRODUCT OF ZERO INTEREST RATES AND NEGATIVE\nINTEREST RATES IN THE CASE OF JAPAN AND GERMANY AND ELSEWHERE.\nIT DOESN'T WORK. >> WE'VE BEEN ENTERTAINING AND\nHEARING FROM SOME OF THE BIGGEST INVESTORS IN THE WORLD WHO SAY\nLOOK WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO VIEWS LIKE YOURS, THE MARKET IS\nNOT READY. NOR IS THE ECONOMY READY.\nWE'VE HEARD IT FROM SCOTT MINOR TO GUGGENHEIM YET AGAIN TODAY\nWITH A SERIES OF TWEETS THAT SAYS THE MARKET IS NOT EXPECTING\nA RATE INCREASE IN SEPTEMBER. YOU'VE HEARD FROM RAY DALIO AT\nOUR OWN DELIVERING ALPHA. YOU HEARD FROM TIMOTHY GEITHNER.\n>> I THINK JOE HIT IT RIGHT IN HIS FIRST COMMENT, AND THAT'S TO\nEXPECT LANGUAGE TO HOPEFULLY FIRM UP AND APPOINT THE WAY TO\nTHE END OF THE WEEK, AND I THINK THAT'S ABOUT AS MUCH AS YOU CAN\nEXPECT. AT THIS JUNCTURE, IF I WERE IN\nTHEIR SHOES AT THIS JUNCTURE, I WOULD BE SUPPORTING THAT.\nI DON'T THINK THEY HAVE MUCH OF A CHOICE.\n>> IT'S JOSH BROWN. ED, WHO IS A STRATEGIST HERE ON\nTHE STREET AND A NOTED FET WATCHER, SAID OVER THE WEEKEND\nTHAT THE U.S. DOLLAR BEING UP 19% SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2014\nIS THE EQUIVALENT OF A 200 BASIS POINT RATE HIKE IN TERMS OF ITS\nAFFECT ON THE ECONOMY. DO YOU BUY THAT?\nHAVE WE HAD A TIGHTENING IN ALL BUT DEED?\n>> WE THINK OF IT IN TERMS OF MARKET, YOU'RE RIGHT.\nSINCE WE IMPORT MORE THAN WE EXPORT AND CONSUME MORE, IT'S A\nPLUS. >> THAT VOICE YOU HEARD TRYING\nTO GET IN ON THE CONVERSATION WAS KEVIN O'LEARY FROM SHARK\nTANK, OF COURSE. OUR RESIDENT SHARK WHO SAYS THE\nMARKET IS READY FOR A HIKE. I KNOW YOU SAY THEY'RE NOT.\nMAYBE YOU GUYS CAN DUKE IT OUT BY SETTLING.\n>> I WANTED TO ASK RICHARD. HE USES THE WORDS GUTTING THE\nINSTITUTIONS, BUT I LOOK AT IT NOT JUST ON THE FACT THAT THEY\nCAN'T MAKE MONEY WITH THE INTEREST RATES WHERE THEY'RE AT,\nBUT WE DON'T TALK ENOUGH ABOUT THE REGULATORY VOOIMT\nENVIRONMENT, WHICH IS EXTREMELY PUNITIVE.\n>> THIS IS WHERE THE HARD-WORKING MIDDLE INCOME --\nTHIS IS WHERE THEY LOOK TO TO HARBOR THEIR SAVINGS AND FEEL\nSAFE AND WE'RE GUTTING THOSE INSTITUTIONS WITH POLICY\nREGULATION. >> THE GUYS HAVE TO PUT MONEY TO\nWORK. ALL OF THE AUM THAT YOU HAVE.\nWHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU LISTEN TO COMMENTS FROM RICHARD FISHER\nAND KEVIN O'LEARY? >> I THINK THE FED WOULD SAY,\nHEY, AT THIS POINT LET'S NOT DO IT NOW.\nWHAT I WOULD BE INTERESTED TO ASK A QUESTION IS DO YOU THINK\nTHAT MAYBE AFTER THE ELECTIONS THEY COULD GO?\nTHEY DON'T HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL DECEMBER.\nYOU HAVE A PERIOD OF TIME WHERE YOU INDICATE NOW YOU BECOME\nHAWKISH LIKE JOE SAID AND YOU CAN DO IT AND YOU CAN SET THE\nTONE FROM THERE. >> DOES ANYBODY AT THE DESK\nTHINK THEY'RE GOING TO GO? IF THEY DO, YOU WOULD BE TOTALLY\nCAUGHT BY SURPRISE. >> EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING IN\nTHAT ENVIRONMENT IS GOING DOWN. BONDS, COMMODITIES.\n>> I THINK THAT WOULD BE THE BEST, AND THAT COULD HAPPEN.\nTHEY DO IT. THEY REASSERT THEMSELVES.\nTHEY STOP TALKING ABOUT IT AFTERWARD.\nWE HAVE A 10% CORRUPTION. I HOPE THEY DO.\n>> RICHARD, DO YOU THINK THE FED IS TOO DEPENDENT ON HOW THE\nMARKET REACTS OR WHAT THE MARKET WANTS THE FED TO DO.\nTHAT'S BEEN THE NARRATIVE FOR MONTHS.\n>> I THINK THE -- YOU HAVE A REVERSE.\nTHE MARKET IS TOO DEPENDENT ON THE FED.\nWE DON'T HAVE STRONG EARNINGS. WE HAVE MODEST GROWTH.\nECONOMIC GROWTH. IT'S FED, FED, FED, CENTRAL\nBANK, CENTRAL BANK, CENTRAL BANK.\n>> AGREE. >> THIS IS THE PROBLEM.\nTHESE LOW RATES AND ZERO INTEREST RATES HAVE UNDERWRITTEN\nA MASSIVE PRICING OF THE MARKET RELATIVE TO UNDERLYING VALUE,\nAND I THINK IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND.\nNOT THE WAY YOU STATED. >> I MEAN, YOU KNOW, LOOK, I'M\nNOT SURPRISED YOU MAYBE WOULD TAKE THAT OPINION, BUT\nRESPECTFULLY WHEN THE FED HAS SAID THAT THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT\nDOING IT OR AT LEAST LED US TO BELIEVE IF THE MARKET HAS HAD A\nFIT OR A TANTRUM, THE FED HAS BACKED OFF.\n>> I WORRY ABOUT THAT. WE TALKED ABOUT THAT WHILE I WAS\nTHERE. >> YOU MENTION 10%.\nWE TALK ABOUT 10% TO 30%. DOES IT AFFECT THE REAL ECONOMY.\nWE HAD A CORRECTION. NO REAL IMPACT.\nWE HAD A CORRECTION IN 1987. WE HAD A CORRECTION AT DOT-COM.\nNO REAL IMPACT. WE'VE HAD SERIOUS REVERSALS.\n37, FOR EXAMPLE. IT'S A YEAR YOU ALWAYS HEAR\nABOUT. THIS IS A DEBATE THAT TAKES\nPLACE AT THE TABLE. YOU CAN HAVE A CORRECTION THAT\nDOES AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF HARM, AND THAT'S A JUDGMENT CALL\nTHEY'LL HAVE TO MAKE. >> HOW MANY PEOPLE IN THE ROOM\nNEED TO BE DISENTERS, IF YOU WILL, OR AGAINST THE CROWD.\n>> IS SHE A VOTING MEMBER? >> SHE'S ALWAYS A VOTING MEMBER.\nSHE'S A G. THE GOVERNORS ARE VOTING\nMEMBERS. THE PRESIDENTS ALTERNATE NATURE.\n>> SHE'S NOT GOING TO GO FOR A HIKE.\nHOW MANY WOULD IT TAKE? >> WELL, TYPICALLY OTHER THAN\nWHEN PAUL VOLCKER WAS THERE, THE RECENT CHAIRS HAVE REALLY SORT\nOF GAGGED AT THREE. TWO IS ALL THEY'LL TOLERATE.\nIF IT GETS TO THREE, IT'S VERY AWKWARD FOR THE CHAIR.\nIT UNDERMINES THEIR POSITION OF AUTHORITY AND LEADERSHIP.\nI DON'T THINK ANY CHAIR REALLY WANTS TO HAVE THREE DISENTS, BUT\nI CAN'T IMAGINE THEM HAVING THREE DISENTERS ON THIS.\n>> THE MARKETS HAVE LOST, I DON'T KNOW, HALF THEIR GAINS\nSINCE WE BEGIN THIS CONVERSATION, RICHARD.\n>> I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REST OF THE PANEL.\nAND YOU. >> WE'LL SEND YOU ABILL.\n>> MAYBE THE SUGGESTION THAT THE LANGUAGE IS GOING TO CHANGE IF\nNOTHING ELSE AND IT'S GOING TO SET US UP FOR A HIKE THIS YEAR\nTHAT THE MARKET PERHAPS DOESN'T LIKE AND IS NEVER GOING TO COME\nTO GRIPS WITH. >> BY THE WAY, I DON'T THINK\nTHEY WOULD DO AN INTERIM MOVE BETWEEN THE NOVEMBER 1K3 2\nMEETING AND DECEMBER MEMBER. IMAGINE IF THEY CALLED A SUDDEN\nPRESS CONFERENCE. IT WOULD BE UPSETTING.\nIT WOULD LEAD TO GREAT VOLATILITY.\nYOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE DECEMBER MEETING.\nIF THEY DON'T MOVE IN SEPTEMBER. WE'LL HAVE ON TO SEE WHAT THEY\nCONTAIN. >> IN 2007 YOU'RE IN THE ROOM.\nYOU WARNED ALL OF THEM ABOUT THE HOUSING MARKET AND THE\nENVIRONMENT. IF YOU WERE IN THE ROOM RIGHT\nNOW, WHAT WOULD YOU BE WARNING THE FEDERAL RESERVE ABOUT?\n>> WELL, WHAT I WAS WARNING THEM ABOUT UP UNTIL 2015 WHEN I\nDEPARTED IN MARCH, WHICH IS WE HAVE EXCESSIVE VALUATION\nRELATIVE -- OR EXCESSIVE PRICING RELATIVE TO PRICING VALUATION\nAND EQUITIES IN BONDS, AND VERY IMPORTANTLY, IN THE WAY WE'VE\nDRICHK DOWN CAP RATES OR THEY HAVE DRIVEN DOWN CAP RATES IN\nTHE REAL ESTATE AREA, GENERALLY SPEAKING ACROSS THE BOARD, THERE\nWAS NEWS TODAY ABOUT HOW THEIR INVESTMENTS ARE FLOWING INTO\nCOMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE THAT THE BANKS JUST WON'T TOUCH.\nTHE BANKS HAVE BEEN FAIRLY LENIENT ON THIS FRONT.\nI THINK THEY'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO DEFLATE THIS BUBBLE\nWITHOUT CREATING THE KIND OF VOLATILITY AND CORRECTION THAT\nCOMES BACK TO BITE THE ECONOMY ON THE REAREND.\nI'M ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT MY DEAR FRIEND SAID WHO WAS A LATE\nCONVERT TO MY VIEWS, BUT I THINK HE HAS IT RIGHT.\n>> HE MAY BE -- HE IS MAKING THE FRONT PAGE OF \"THE JOURNAL.\"\nMONEY AND INVESTING SECTION TODAY.\nHE QUESTIONS HOW MUCH OF A DOVE HE IS REMAINING.\n>> HE IS A GOOD GUY, BY THE WAY. HE CAME OUT THROUGH THE\nREGULATORY AND SUPERVISORY SIDE. >> I APPRECIATE THE\nCONVERSATION. IT'S OUR MAIDEN VOYAGE.\nI'M GLAD YOU'RE ON THE SHIP TODAY.\n>> AS AN OEL NAVY MAN, I AAPPRECIATE THE ANALOGY.\n>> KEVIN, YOU KNOW, PART OF THIS MOVE IN THE MARKET AND MAYBE\nMORE SUBSTANTIVE THAN SOME OF THE THINGS THAT RICHARD FISHER\nHAD TO SAY IN THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT THE FED, APPLE IS LOSING A\nLITTLE BIT OF STEAM AND MAYBE THAT IS HURTING THE DOW AS WELL.\nTHE OVERALL MARKET WAS REALLY COMING DOWN DURING OUR\nCONVERSATION. WE'VE BEEN ASKING YOU, ARE YOU\nGOING TO GET BACK INTO THE STOCK BECAUSE IT'S HAD THIS INCREDIBLE\nRUN. SOME SAY TOO FAR TOO FAST.\nI JUST WANT YOU TO GET READY BECAUSE WE'RE COMING TO YOU\nNEXT. I WANT TO FIND OUT IF YOU WANT\nTO GET BACK INTO IT OR NOT. THAT'S A TEASER THERE.\nTHERE ARE SHARES. OUR OWN STEVE WEISS HAS BEEN\nSAYING THE STOCK WAS GOING TO SOAR.\nWE'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT HE IS DOING NEXT WITH HIS SHARES ON\nTHE HALFTIME REPORT.",

AND THAT, AT LEAST SO FAR, NO\nINDICATION THERE IS A TERRORISM CELL OPERATING IN THE CITY.\nIN REGARDS TO THE MASS MOBILE ALERT SENT OUT THIS MORNING,\nOFFICIALS SAYING THIS TOOL AIDED IN THE HELP OF THE APPREHENSION\nOF THAT SUSPECT, RAHAMI, AND BACK HERE ON 23rd STREET, WHERE\nA BOMB EXPLODED SATURDAY NIGHT, THE INVESTIGATION IS STILL\nONGOING. YOU CAN SEE BEHIND ME, THE FBI\nIS STILL ON THE SCENE AND THE NEW YORK FIRE DEPARTMENT IS HERE\nON THE STREET, WHICH IS STILL CLOSED DOWN AS WELL.\nGUYS, BACK OVER TO YOU. >> THANK YOU, MORGAN BRENNAN, IN\nMANHATTAN, WITH THE LATEST ON THAT STORY.\nLET'S GET MORE ON WHAT IS FUELING THE WEAKNESS ON THE\nMARKET NOW. GOOD TO SEE YOU.\nMARK, I'LL START WITH YOU. YOU AS WELL AS MANY OTHER MARKET\nWATCHERS OUT THERE THINK NOTHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN ON WEDNESDAY.\nBUT AT THE SAME TIME, EVEN THOUGH THERE IS AN EXPECTATION\nNOTHING IS HAPPENING, WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS THE TEN YEAR YIELD\nIS CREEPING HIGHER. WE HAVE -- AND THE DOLLAR INDEX\nIS UP BY 1.4%. SO ISN'T THE FED'S WORK BEING\nDONE IN A WAY. >> IN A WAY, IT IS.\nI THINK OUR BOND YIELDS ARE MOVING UP, SPREADS REMAIN\nRELATIVELY EVEN WITH OTHER BONDS AROUND THE WORLD THAT HAVE BEEN\nBACKED UP HERE, PARTICULARLY THE TEN-YEAR GERMAN BUND AND\nJAPANESE GOVERNMENT BOND. ALL ON THE SUSPICION THEIR\nCENTRAL BANKS MAY BE LIMITED IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY CAN DO OR ARE\nOUT OF BULLETS. BUT THE STRENGTH OF THE DOLLAR\nIS DOING THE FED'S HEAVY LIFTING, IS CURBING INFLATION\nAND ACTING AS A GOVERNOR IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY.\nIT IS A FEEDBACK LOOP THE FED IS CAUGHT IN, EVERY TIME THEY LEAN\nHAWKISH, IT STRENGTHENS THE DOLLAR AND IT IS PRODUCTIVE TO\nONE OF THE DUAL MANDATES THEY CONTINUE TO WHIFF ON, PRICE\nSTABILITY MEASURED BY 2% INFLATION RATE.\n>> HOW DOES THAT INFLUENCE THE MARKETS AND YOUR VIEW OF THE\nMARKETS GOING INTO YEAR END? >> THE STRONGER DOLLAR MEANT\nWEAKNESS FOR THE EQUITY MARKETS. THERE IS A NUMBER OF CROSS\nCURRENTS. YOU CONTINUE TO HAVE LOW RATES,\nSTIMULATIVE MONETARY POLICY, LOW INFLATION, ALL OF THESE ARE\nREASONABLY POSITIVE FOR THE EQUITY MARKETS.\nTHE OTHER THING IS, WE HAVE SEEN THE PRETTY MEANINGFUL INVENTORY\nCORRECTION AND WE HAVE RELATIVELY LOW EARNINGS\nEXPECTATIONS FOR THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.\nAGAIN, FAIRLY POSITIVE FOR THE NEAR TERM MARKET ACTIVITY.\nTHE BIGGEST UNCERTAINTY IN THE NEGATIVE IS 2017.\nIF WE DON'T SEE RESURGENCE OF CAPITAL SPENDING, IF WE DON'T\nSEE PICKUP IN NEW BUSINESS FORMATION, I THINK MARKETS COULD\nRUN OUT OF STEAM, BUT FOR THE NEAR TERM, STILL LOOKS PRETTY\nGOOD. >> SOUNDS LIKE YOU THINK THERE\nCOULD BE A GLIDE PATH SETTING UP FOR STOCKS IN THE NEXT FEW\nMONTHS OR SO? SAFE TO BE IN THE MARKET SO TO\nSPEAK? >> THE MARKET HAS BEEN VERY MUCH\nIN THE RISK ON, RISK OFF TYPE OF VOLATILE ENVIRONMENT, SO TO SAY\nIT IS SAFE, I WOULDN'T DESCRIBE IT THIS WAY.\nBUT AT THIS POINT, I THINK THERE ARE MORE TAILWINDS THAN HEAD\nWINDS, BUT AS WE APPROACH 17, THE DANGER SIGNS START TO FLASH\nMUCH MORE LOUDLY. >> GIVE EN YOUR VIEW OF WHERE\nRATES WILL BE, WHERE THEY ARE TODAY, DOES THAT -- IN THE VIEW\nTHERE IS THIS FREE AREA HERE FOR THE MARKET TO GO HIGHER, IS IT\nBETTER -- IF YOU HAD HAD TO INVEST THE DOLLAR TODAY OR\nWHATEVER AMOUNT IT IS TODAY IN DIVIDEND YIELDING STOCKS, SAFETY\nPLAYS THAT HAD BEEN IN FAVOR FOR SO LONG, THE FAVORITES OF LOW\nVOLATILITY FUND ETFs AND ACTIVE FUNDS OUT THERE OR IN GROWTH,\nLIKE TECHNOLOGY? >> A LITTLE OF BOTH.\nI THINK THAT WHILE WE HAVE SEEN A BACKUP IN THE INTEREST RATE\nSENSITIVE SECTORS HERE, TEN YEAR BOND YIELDS BOUNCED SOMEWHAT, I\nSUSPECT THERE IS A CERTAIN SELF-LIMITING CHARACTERISTIC\nABOUT THE MARKET THAT THE ECONOMY CAN'T TOLERATE\nSIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER RATES. SO WHILE I DO EXPECT THE FED TO\nBE ON HOLD THIS MEETING, THEY'LL USE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SIGNAL\nTHAT A RATE HIKE IN DECEMBER IS A VERY HIGH PROBABILITY AND AS\nTHE MARKET BAKES THAT IN, THEY THINK THE FED WILL FEEL MORE\nCOMFORTABLE IN GOING FORWARD WITH THAT DECISION AND THEREFORE\nI STILL THINK WE WANT TO BE IN GROWTH SECTORS THAT WILL DO WELL\nREGARDLESS OF THE UNDERPINNINGS ECONOMICALLY AND IN OR ON THE\nRATES SIDE AND BE SENSITIVE TO THE INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY OF\nTHE CLASSIC DEFENSES BUT THE FACT THEY HAVE BEEN BID UP TO\nTHE POINT WHERE THE VALUATIONS TOLERATE LITTLE ROOM FOR ERROR.\n>> GUYS, LEAVE IT THERE.",

AND I DON'T CARE WHETHER YOU'RE\nDEALING WITH AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNMENTS LIKE RUSSIA OR CHINA\nOR THE DEMOCRACIES IN THE WEST, STRUCTURAL CHANGES AREN'T FORTH\nCOMING. SO THE CENTRAL BANKS ARE THE\nONES THAT ARE TRYING TO GET US OUT OF THIS PROBLEM.\nAND TO ME, WITH INTEREST RATES WHERE THEY ARE RIGHT NOW, YOU\nKNOW, THEY'RE NOT PROVIDING MUCH JUICE.\n>> LET'S BRING IN CHARLES RYANHARD AT MAINSTAY\nINVESTMENTS. WELCOME.\nGOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. LAST WEEK, ONE OF THE THREADS OF\nCONVERSATION AT OUR DELIVERING ALPHA CONVERSATION WAS THAT OUR\nMONETARY POLICY HAS SORT OF RUN ITS COURSE.\nIN OTHER WORDS, THAT IT CAN'T DO WHAT IT USED TO DO OUT OF\nBULLETS, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CHOOSE YOUR METAPHOR.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK? THAT'S WHAT MR. PAULSON SEEMS TO\nBE SAYING? >> BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAD\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND BECAUSE WE HAD NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES\nIN PARTS OF THE WORLD, WE ARE FURTHER ALONG THAT CHANNEL.\nNOT AT THE MORE EFFECTIVE STAGE, MORE POTENT PHASE OF MONETARY\nPOLICY WHEN LIFTING LOWERING RATES FROM A HIGHER LEVEL.\nWE'RE WAY BEYOND THAT NOW. IT IS HELPFUL TO LOOK AT OTHER\nSOLUTIONS TO TRY TO REVIVE -- >> WE HAVE NOT SEEN A LOT IN\nTHIS COUNTRY CERTAINLY. FISCAL STIMULUS, EITHER THROUGH\nTAX CUTS OR HEIGHTENED SPENDING. IS THAT WHAT IT WILL TAKE TO GET\nTHE ECONOMY MOVING FROM THAT 2% TRAJECTORY HIGHER, NUMBER ONE.\nNUMBER TWO, WILL IT TAKE WHAT MR. PAULSON WAS TALKING ABOUT,\nSTRUCTURAL CHANGE, MAJOR TAX REFORM AMONG OTHER THINGS?\n>> BOTH. I WAS HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH\nONE OF OUR PORTFOLIO MANAGERS ON OUR GLOBAL EQUITY YIELD STRATEGY\nLAST WEEK AND ASKED HIM WHAT WOULD BE A POSITIVE BLACK SWAN,\nSOMEONE THAT HAS LOW PROBABILITY BUT HIGH IMPACT IF IT WERE TO\nHAPPEN, HE SUGGESTED ENOUGH INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING AROUND\nTHE WORLD TO LIFT GLOBAL GROWTH BY 1%.\nTHE CASE OF REFORM, THE STEPS THAT WE NEED TO TAKE HAVE TO BE\nSTEPS THAT CAN IMPROVE THE LEVEL OF PRODUCTIVITY OR THE LABOR\nFORCE GROWTH RATE. AND SO TO THE DEGREE THAT YOU\nCAN CREATE YOUR FORM THAT CREATES INCENTIVES THAT ALLOWS\nFOR PRODUCTIVITY TO ENHANCE, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN HAVE A\nSUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC IMPACT. >> WHAT IF THE FED RAISES RATES?\n>> THAT WOULD NOT HELP THEM ACHIEVE THEIR GOAL.\n>> WHAT IS THEIR GOAL? >> THEIR GOAL IS MAXIMUM\nEMPLOYMENT AND 2% INFLATION. >> HOW IS THE HIKE GOING TO\nIMPACT EMPLOYMENT? >> NOT VERY MUCH.\nTHE IDEA IS IF YOU'RE DECIDING IF YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE AN\nIRREVERSIBLE DECISION, LIKE OPENING UP A NEW PLANT OR HIRING\nNEW PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT SEEMS MORE UNPREDICTABLE TO YOU\nBECAUSE YOU WERE CONDITIONED TO THINK IT MIGHT BE LATER IN THE\nYEAR THAN RIGHT NOW, WE NEVER THOUGHT THAT THIS FED RATE\nHIKE -- >> YOU THINK BUSINESS OWNERS ARE\nTHAT OBSESSED WITH THE FED AS WE ARE?\n>> THEY WANT TO SEE A FULL ORDER BOOK BEFORE THEY EXPAND AND WANT\nTO ALSO KNOW THAT THEY WANT TO GET THE SENSE THAT THEY\nUNDERSTAND THE ENVIRONMENT WITH WHICH THEY'RE OPERATING IN.\nAT THIS POINT, THE FED IS DATA DEPENDENT AND THE MORE RECENT\nDATA HASN'T BEEN STRONG ENOUGH, THEY HAVEN'T POSITIONED THE\nMARKET AND THE ECONOMY FOR IT. THAT BEING SAID, WE DO THINK\nULTIMATELY THEY'LL RESUME, THEY'LL RAISE RATES.\nAGAIN, NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A SPRINT.\nWE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A MARATHON.\n>> YOU AGREE WITH WHAT MARK CONCLUDED BY SAYING AND THAT IS\nTHAT NO ACTION THIS TIME, BUT SOME WORDS THAT INDICATE THEY'RE\nREADY TO GO IN THE FUTURE. >> THEY WANT TO LEAVE THE DOOR\nOPEN. I AGREE WITH VADIM ON WHAT HE\nTELESCOPED THE TAILWINDS AND HEAD WINDS OF THE MARKET AS\nWELL. >> ARE YOU THINKING DECEMBER AND\nTHEN MORE INTEREST RATE HIKES IN 2017?\nOR IS IT A ONE AND DONE OR ONE AND WAIT?\n>> I THINK ONE AND -- PROBABLY ONE AND WAIT.\nWE THINK THE ODDS ARE 50/50, MAYBE BETTER AROUND DECEMBER.\nTHEY'LL GO AGAIN, BUT VERY SLOW TIGHTENING CYCLE.\nTHERE ARE THINGS THAT CONSUMERS CAN DO IN THE MEANTIME.\n>> LIKE CORPORATES. >> THERE ARE TREMENDOUS\nOPPORTUNITIES IN CREDIT. IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO GENERATE\nINCOME AND ELECTION PROOF YOUR PORTFOLIO HEADING INTO THE\nELECTIONS, ONE GREAT WAY TO DO THAT IS ANCHOR WITH MUNICIPAL\nBONDS. WE LIKE THE TEN YEARS, NOW PART\nOF THE CURVE. WE LIKE TRANSPORTATION BONDS.\nWE SPOKE ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE EARLIER.\nTHERE WAS A TRANSPORTATION BILL THAT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW NOT\nTHAT LONG AGO THAT WOULD BE AN EXAMPLE.\nWE LIKE TRANSPORTATION BONDS, ESPECIALLY IN PARTS OF THE STATE\nTHAT WHERE, LIKE, TEXAS AND OTHER AREAS AND EDUCATION BONDS.\nTHINKING ABOUT EQUITIES FOR A MOMENT, YOU ASKED A QUESTION\nEARLIER ABOUT DIVIDENDS OR GROWTH.\nWELL, WHAT WE LIKE, ONE OF THE STRATEGIES WE REALLY LIKE IS TO\nFIND COMPANIES THAT ARE GROWING, THAT THEY'RE VERY GOOD STEWARDS\nOF CAPITAL AND GOOD AT WEIGHING DECISIONS SHOULD I GET A GOOD\nRETURN ON INVESTMENT IF I DO REINVEST IN MY BUSINESS OR\nSHOULD I BE RETURNING TO SHAREHOLDERS.\nWE LIKE COMPANIES THAT ARE MAKING GOOD CAPITAL ALLOCATION\nDECISIONS -- >> SUCH AS?\n>> VERIZON AND THESE ARE THE NAMES YOU KNOW.\nTHEY ALSO HAVE THE YIELDS YOU NEED.\nTHESE WOULD BE NAMES LIKE VERIZON OR NATIONAL GRID, AND\nTHESE ARE COMPANIES THAT ARE GROWING THEIR CASH FLOW STREAMS,\nIN CASES REINVESTING IN BUSINESS, LIKE VERIZON, TO KEEP\nUP BEST IN CLASS NETWORK, DOING SMART THINGS LIKE PAYING DOWN\nDEBT OR PAYING DIVIDENDS AND GROWING THEM IN ORDER TO RETURN\nCASH TO SHAREHOLDERS.

LET'S BRING IN NELEH RICHARDSON.\nHOW DO WE DIG INTO THE NUMBERS? THEY SEEM GOOD, BUT ARE THEY?\n>> YES, THEY ARE GOOD. WHAT IT SHOWS IS THE HOUSING\nMARKET ON NEW CONSTRUCTION IS GOING TO PERFORM MUCH BETTER IN\nTHE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR THAN IT DID IN THE -- BEFORE.\nWE ARE STILL 36% DOWN FROM WHERE WE WERE IN 2007 IN TERMS OF\nSINGLE FAMILY CONSTRUCTION. DEMAND HAS NEVER BEEN HIGHER.\nFUNDAMENTALS FOR DEMAND ARE STRONG.\nWE HAVE GREAT JOB GROWTH, LOW INTEREST RATES.\nHOUSEHOLD FORMATION. THESE FUNDAMENTALS ARE STRONGER\nTHAN THEY HAVE BEEN SINCE 2007 AND YET WE STILL DON'T HAVE\nCONSTRUCTION THAT MEETS THAT DEMAND.\nON THE DEMAND SIDE, THINGS LOOK GREAT.\nIT IS THE SUPPLY SIDE THAT STILL IS SHOWING WORK.\nBUT THAT SHOWS THAT THEY ARE TILTED TOWARDS THE STRONG DEMAND\nBECAUSE THEY FEEL MORE ENCOURAGED BY THAT THAN THE\nBLOCKS IN SUPPLY. >> FORTUNE MAGAZINE CALLED YOU\nTHE INTERNET'S TRUTH TELLING ECONOMIST.\nSMALL TOWN, INDIANA GIRL, MADE GOOD.\nTELL US SOME TRUTH ABOUT THE HOUSING MARKET THAT WE'RE NOT\nTALKING ABOUT, THE QUESTIONS THAT MAYBE WE'RE NOT ASKING\nRIGHT NOW. >> WHAT SURPRISES ME THE MOST\nABOUT THIS ELECTION SEASON IS THE FOCUS ON ECONOMY THE\nECONOMICS ON THE ECONOMY, ON INCOMES, AND THE LACK OF FOCUS\nON HOUSING. HOUSING IS SOME PLACE THAT\nEVERYBODY HAS IN COMMON. ONE THING EVERYONE SHARES.\nTHE LACK OF IT IS A CAUSE FOR CONCERN.\nHAVING IT IS CAUSE FOR ATTENTION.\nAND YET WE DON'T SEE A LOT OF TALK ABOUT IT.\nWE ARE IN A HOUSING SHORTAGE AFFORDABILITY CRISIS IN MANY\nCITIES. WE HAVE 50% OF RENTERS PAYING\nMORE THAN 30% OF THEIR INCOMES ON THEIR RENT.\nHOUSING IS SO LINKED TO YOUR OPPORTUNITIES, TO WHAT SCHOOL\nYOU GO TO, THE CRIMES YOU'RE INVOLVED WITH AND YET WE'RE NOT\nHEARING IT. SO I THINK THIS IS THE PLACE\nWHERE TRUTH IS MEETING. THE ROLE OF HOUSING AND THIS\nELECTION CYCLE, AND HOW THINGS LIKE IMMIGRATION REFORM WILL\nAFFECT HOUSING GOING FORWARD. >> I'M CURIOUS, BECAUSE WE HAVE\nSO MANY FED DISCUSSIONS NOW, THE FED MEETING COMING UP ON\nWEDNESDAY, AND ALL WE HEAR IS SLOW LACKLUSTER GROWTH.\nTHEN YOU SEE THE HOUSING PICTURE AND I THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT\nTWO SEPARATE ECONOMIES. HAVE WE BEEN IN THIS SITUATION\nWHERE HOUSING AND THE HOUSING MARKET SHOWS HYPERGROWTH AND\nOTHERS SAYING LACKLUSTER GROWTH? >> THERE HAS BEEN BASICALLY A\nBIPOLAR NATURE BETWEEN THE MARKETS AND HOUSING MARKET SINCE\nTHE BUST. EVERY GOOD NEWS IN TERMS OF\nINTEREST RATES WERE READ ONE WAY IN THE STOCK MARKET AND ANOTHER\nWAY IN HOUSING. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS\nHOUSING HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR LIFTING THE ECONOMY OUT OF\nRECESSION AND EVERY PREVIOUS RECESSION EXCEPT THIS ONE.\nIT HAS BEEN SLOW TO LIFT OFF, SLOW TO RECOVER.\nAND NOW IT SEEMS TO HAVE LEGS WHILE THE REST OF THE ECONOMY IS\nSLOWING. THE QUESTION IS WHO WILL WIN THE\nHORSE RACE, THE MARKETS, THE REAL ECONOMY?\nMY BET IS ON THE REAL ECONOMY. >> ONE QUICK QUESTION HERE, HOW\nMUCH DO YOU THINK PEOPLE WILL REACT TO HIGHER INTEREST RATES?\nI THINK PEOPLE, WHEN THEY BUY A HOUSE, THEY BUY THE PAYMENT, NOT\nTHE PRICE OF THE HOUSE. >> THAT'S RIGHT.\n>> THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT THEY'LL PAY FOR MONTH.\nAND IF THE PAYMENTS GO UP WHAT DOES THAT DO?\n>> THEY'RE NOT CHECKING THE INTEREST RATE EVERY SINGLE DAY\nWHEN DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT THEY NEED A NEW HOME FOR THE\nNEXT TRIAL. CONSUMERS ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE\nPAYMENT. THE INTEREST RATE WILL AFFECT\nTHE SIZE OF THE HOME THEY GET, MIGHT AFFECT THE LOCATION.\nBUT IT DOESN'T GENERALLY STOP THEM FROM BUYING A HOUSE.\nTHAT BEING SAID, WE HAVE A WHOLE GENERATION OF HOME BUYERS,\nMILLENNIALS, WHO NEVER HAVE SEEN AN INTEREST RATE OVER 5%.\nWE'RE IN NEW TERRITORY. >> I WANT THEM TO FEEL THAT\nPAIN. >> THEY'RE FEELING OTHER KINDS\nOF PAIN, BRIAN, BELIEVE ME. >> DO NOT ASSOCIATE BRIAN\nWITH -- >> I'M THE NICE ONE.\nHE'S A REDSKIN FAN, ALL SHAKEN UP TODAY BECAUSE THEY STINK.\n>> BABY BOOMER, ALL THAT BUSINESS.\n>> NELEH RICHARDSON TELLING SOME TRUTH, TYLER IS MEAN.\n>> THANK YOU, GUYS.",

I DON'T LIKE THEM AND I'M NOT\nSURE IT MATTERS WHAT DOES HAPPEN TOMORROW.\nBUT JUST TO PUT THE NUMBERS IN CONTEXT, THIS IS THE\nPERFORMANCE, I HAVE TWO PANELS HERE.\nFIRST WHEN THE FED RAISES AND THEN WHAT WH THEY CUT THE FED\nFUNDS CART RATE. THIS IS ON THE NEXT DAY.\nONE WEEK AND ONE MONTH. WHEN THEY RAISE.\nAND OBVIOUSLY IT IS DOWN. AS WOULD BE EXPECTED.\nAND THE PERCENTAGE IT WILL BE DOWN IS ALMOST 60%.\nBY CONTRA DISTINCTION, WHEN IT LOWERS, THIS IS THE PERFORMANCE\nOF HOME BUILDERS. THIS IS OBVIOUS STUFF.\nBUT DO THEY LOOK GOOD TECHNICALLY AND THEY DON'T.\nLET'S LOOK AT A FEW CHARTS. SO S&P 500, YOUR BLUE LINE, THIS\nIS THE ETF THAT MEASURES HOME BUILDERS AND OTHER THINGS LIKE\nHOME DEPOT AND LOWE'S AND THE GREEN LINE AND THAT IS ALL\nPUBLICLY TRADED HOME BUILDING STOCKS, AND THERE ARE 26 OF\nTHEM. AND WHAT YOU SEE HERE IS THE\nUNDERPERFORMANCE OF THE GREEN LINE RELATIVE TO THE ETF\nRELATIVE TO THE MARKET. AND THAT IS KIND OF THE PROBLEM.\nTHEY JUST ARE NOT DOING WELL. AND RELATIVE PERFORMANCE AND\nSTRENGTH MATTERS A LOT. HERE IT IS ON A THREE-YEAR\nBASIS. YOU COULD SEE THE GROUP OF 26\nNAMES PLOTTED EQUAL WEIGHT. IT IS NOT GOOD.\nNOW WHAT MIGHT BE COMING? THIS IS THAT GROUP ON ITS OWN,\nTHE 26 STOCKS. I THINK YOU COULD DRAW THE LINES\nLIKE THIS. WE WORKED OURSELVES INTO A\nPOSITION WHERE WE WILL BREAK BELOW THIS WELL-DEFINED LINE AND\nIT LOOKS IMMINENT. TO PUT THIS IN CONTEXT, I WANT\nTO TALK ABOUT THE ACTUAL NUMBERS.\nTHERE ARE 26 PUBLICLY TRADED STOCKS.\nD.R. HORTON IS 11 BILLION AND IF YOU ADD THEM UP THAT IS 66\nBILLION AND ALL PUBLICLY TRADED HOME BUILDERS ARE 66 BILLION AND\nTHE STOCKS COMPARE TO THAT. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT ONE-THIRD\nOF 1%. IT DOESN'T MATTER FOR THE\nMARKET. WE KNOW IT A BIG THING FOR THE\nECONOMY AND EMPLOYMENT AND HOME BUILDING BUT AS IT RELATES TO\nTHE IMPACT, IT IS NOT THAT BIG. I THINK HOME BUILDERS TRADE\nLOWER. >> TRADE LOWER.\n>> I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS. >> CARTER, COME ON OVER.\nASHLEY, BRING ON THE CHAIR. HERE WE GO.\n>> YOU WERE LOOKING AT A CHART. >> YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE\nHOME BUILDING AND YOU DID A GREAT JOB, BUT THERE IS A LOT OF\nEQUIPMENT GUYS IN THERE. THERE IS HOME DEPOT IN THERE AND\nA LOT OF STUFF IN THERE BUT NONE OF THAT ACTS PARTICULARLY WELL.\nAND I WAS LOOKING AT TOLL BROTHERS TODAY, BACK IN LATE\nAUGUST THEY REPORTED A BEAT AND A RAISE AND THE STOCK RALLIED 9%\nTHE DAY OF THAT AND IT HAS GIVEN ALL OF THAT BACK AND I'VE\nLEARNED THAT RELATIVE IMPORTANCE IS IMPORTANT AND THE SECTOR IS\nBAD AND IF YOU GET INTO THE MINDSET WHERE THE RAISE IS GOING\nTO RAISE AT SOME POINT IN DECEMBER, I THINK THEY BREAK THE\nLEVELS YOU TALK ABOUT. >> I THINK IT IS TOTALLY THE\nOPPOSITE. LOOK AT THE CHART ON PULTE, I\nLIKE THAT YOU'VE BEEN TRADING BETWEEN A PREDICTABLE RANGE AND\nTHEY HAVEN'T BROKEN OUT BUT THE HOUSING DATA IS CONTINUING TO\nGET BETTER AND WE'RE AT ALL TIME LOWS IN TERMS OF HOME OWNERSHIP\nAND SEEING SOME RECOVERY. >> THAT IS OUT THERE.\nNOT SAYING THAT YOU ARE SAYING SOMETHING THAT IS OBVIOUS, BUT\nWHY ARE THEY NOT COMING UP WITH THE MARKET ON A BASIS WHEN RATES\nARE THIS LOW FOR THIS LONG. AND EVEN AS THE EARNINGS HAVEN'T\nBEEN GOOD. >> RATES ARE TOO LOW.\nBANKS DON'T WANT TO LEND MONEY OUT.\nWHY WOULD A BANK WANT TO LEND MONEY OUT TO THE HOUSING MARKET\nWHEN THEY COULD GIVE IT BACK TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND COLLECT\nA CHECK.

WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S GOING TO\nDO. HE IS THE WILD CARD HERE AND HE\nMEANS VOLATILITY. >> I THINK WE'VE HAD VOLATILITY.\nAND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE CORRELATION AND THE HORRIFIC\nEVENTS IN NEW YORK OVER THE WEEKEND ADD TO TRUMP FERVOR OR\nWHATEVER THIS IS THAT IS DRIVING PEOPLE OUT OF THIS CAMPAIGN.\nI THINK ABOUT THE ECONOMY AND WE ALL KNOW THAT THE DEFICIT\nPERSPECTIVE THAT NEITHER HILLARY OR TRUMP ARE ATTRACTIVE FOR THE\nDEFICIT. BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE ONE\nFUNDAMENTAL THING TRUMP MEANS FOR THE ECONOMY OR COMPANIES IN\nTHE MARKET IN THE NEXT PHASE IF HE'S ELECTED IS THE TAX ISSUE.\nAND I THINK OFF SHORE REPATRIATION AND ALSO THOSE\nCOMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN UNWILLING TO INVEST.\nSOMEBODY LIKE GE, THEY ARE WAITING FOR ANIA NEW\nADMINISTRATION TO GO HARDER. AND APPLE AND GOOGLE, A LOT OF\nCASH TO BRING BACK. >> AND THERE ARE A COUPLE OF\nTHINGS. BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM IS IF TRUMP\nIS IN, YOU WILL GET A STRONG DOLLAR WHICH WILL HURT THE\nEXPORTERS. AND ON THE OTHER SIDE, THIS IS\nMY VIEW ON WHY WALL STREET HAS NOT PANICKED, BECAUSE WITH TRUMP\nYOU KNOW YOU WILL GET A MASSIVE FISCAL SIMULUS WHICH WILL HELP\nOUT THE ECONOMY IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER AND THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE\nARE BALANCING. THAT BEING SAID, I STILL THINK\nLEADING UP IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS, MASSIVE --\n>> AND HOW ABOUT IF TRUMP TAKES THE LEAD AND STARTS GOING ON,\nAND REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID ABOUT FED CHAIRMAN YELLEN AND I'M DEAD\nWOMAN WALKING HERE IF HE WINS THIS THING, YOU KNOW WHAT -- YOU\nSAID YOU ARE ASHAMED AT WHAT I'VE DONE WITH RATES, MAYBE 50\nBIPS, THAT FIRST ONE, HOW ABOUT ANOTHER 25 ON THE WAY OUT.\nYOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

MARKETS HAVE HAD THE RUN-IN.\nWHOEVER IS IN THE WHITE HOUSE, I THINK WE'RE DISAPPOINTED IN\nNOVEMBER. AND I THINK TRUMP WOULD BE\nTERRIBLE FOR THE DOLLAR. IF YOU GET WALLS AND TRADE PACS\nARE CUT BUT THE REALITY IS WE HAVE A DEFICIT, WE ARE RAISING\nTHE DOLLAR LEVELS, IT IS NEGATIVE.\n>> TOSS A COIN IN THE AIR. MARKETS ARE MORE FOCUSED ON WHAT\nWILL HAPPEN IN JAPAN AND WITH THE FED RIGHT NOW.\nTHAT IS WHAT THE NEAR TERM FOCUS IS IN THE MARKET.\nBUT IF TRUMP DOES GET ELECTED, HOW DO YOU INVEST.\nWHAT DO YOU LOOK AT? I'M STILL STOCK SPECIFIC.\nYOU WILL SEE SECTORS TRADE IN VERY DIFFERENT RANGES.\nI DON'T NECESSARILY BELIEVE THAT A CLINTON PRESIDENCY, THAT SHE'S\nGOING TO BE ABLE TO GET A LOT DONE, A LOT MORE DONE THAN\nOBAMA. I LOOK AT A TRUMP PRESIDENCY AND\nSAY WE MAY TAKE A NEAR TERM PULLBACK.\n>> WHO RUR VOTING FOR. >> MEXICO CEMENT, THEY WILL HAVE\nA BIG CONTRACT. >> IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE\nBULLISH -- >> WE NEED TO PAY SOMEBODY --\n>> SOMEBODY HAS TO PAY FOR -- FOR THE WALL.\n>> I'M NOT A STATUS QUO. I LOOK AND SEE WHAT DO WE NEED.\nWE NEED TO SHAKE UP WASHINGTON, D.C.\n>> OH, STOP IT. >> SO THINK ABOUT THE POSITIVE\nFOR THE ECONOMY. >> SO TRUMP IS -- WHAT IS THE\nBOTTOM LINE. TRUMP WILL BE GOOD?\n>> NEAR TERM TRUMP IS NOT NECESSARILY GOOD FOR THE\nMARKETS. LONGER TERM, HOWEVER, AFTER HE\nSEES -- I'M TELLING YOU, YOU WILL LOOK BACK SIX MONTHS AFTER\nHE'S ELECTED AND GETS ON THE RIGHT PATH AND DOESN'T SAY\nANYTHING STUPID, THE MARKET CHANGES GEARS AND GOES INTO THE\nUPSWING.

THEY ARE ON TAPE.\nSTILL AHEAD, BIOTECH CONTINUING TO SURGE HIGHER TODAY BUT COULD\nTHE RUN SOON COME TO A SCREECHING HALT.\nWE'LL TAKE YOU BEHIND THE TRADE THAT SAYS TROUBLE COULD BE\nBREWING IN BIOTECH.

THAT HAS NOT STARTED YET.\nWE'LL BRING YOU THE HEADLINES AS THEY COME.\nBACK OVER TO YOU. >> DO WE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE\nCONDITION OF THE OFFICERS, TWO WERE STRUCK, ARE THEIR WOUNDS\nLIFE THREATENING OR DO YOU KNOW? >> STILL GETTING A LOT OF\nDETAILS, BUT WE DO KNOW FROM OUR -- FROM NBC IS THAT BOTH HAD\nSTILL BEEN ALIVE, BUT I HAVE TO GET MORE DETAILS BEFORE I START\nSPEAKING ON THAT. >> ALL RIGHT.\nGOOD TO SAY NOTHING WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE THE ABSOLUTE DETAILS\nTHERE IN FRONT OF YOU.",

MORE ON THAT IN A MOMENT.\nTHIS MORNING HOURS AFTER IDENTIFYING AHMAD KHAN RAHAMI AS\nA PERSON OF INTEREST AND TAKE THE EXTRAORDINARY STEP OF ASKING\nTHE PUBLIC FOR HELP VIA TEXT ERT, POLICE RESPONDED TO A\nCALL THAT A MAN SLEEPING IN THE DOORWAY OF A BAR IN LINDEN, NEW\nJERSEY. WHEN OFFICERS AARRIVED, HE\nOPENED FIRE. RAHAMI ORIGINALLY FROM\nAFGHANISTAN WAS STRUCK BY MULTIPLE POLICE BULLETS AND\nAPPREHENDED JUST AFTER 11:00. REPORTEDLY CONSCIOUS AND AWAKE.\nTHROUGH AN INCREDIBLY FORTUNE SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES, WHAT COULD\nHAVE BEEN A MASS CASUALTY EVENT ULTIMATELY TOOK A MUCH MILDER\nHUMAN TOLL. A CHAIN OF EVENTS BEGAN AFTER\n9:30 ON SATURDAY MORNING WHEN A PIPE BOMB EXPLODED IN SEASIDE\nPARK, NEW JERSEY, ALONG THE ROUTE OF A CHARITY RACE\nBENEFITTING THE MARINE CORPS. THE START OF THE RACE WAS\nDELAYED AND NO ONE WAS INJURED.  WEST 23rd STREET IN MANHATTAN\nWOUNDING 29 PEOPLE IN THE AREA. ALL OF THEM ARE ALREADY OUT OF\nTHE HOSPITAL AND MIRACULOUSLY NOT A SINGLE PERSON WAS KILLED.\nLESS THAN THREE HOURS LATER, A SECOND SIMILAR DEVICE APPARENTLY\nA PRESSURE COOKER BOMB WAS DISCOVER ON 27th STREET.\nTHAT DEVICE WAS TAKEN INTO POLICE CUSTODY AND LATER TURNED\nOVER TO THE FBI. AND LAST NIGHT AT A TRAIN\nSTATION IN NEW JERSEY, TWO HOMELESS MAN FOUND A BACKPACK IN\nA GARBAGE CAN CONTAINING FIVE UNDETONATED BOMBS.\nONE OF THE DEVICES EXPLODED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AS IT\nWAS BEING EXAMINED BY A BOMB ROBOT.\nNO ONE WAS HURT. PRESIDENT OBAMA IN NEW YORK CITY\nFOR THE U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY THANKED LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT\nFOR SAFELY BRINGING THE SUSPECT INTO CUSTODY.\n>> FOR US TO BE ABLE TO APPREHEND A SUSPECT IN JUST A\nLITTLE OVER 24 HOURS AFTER AN EVENT TAKES PLACE LIKE THIS IS\nOUTSTANDING POLICE WORK, OUTSTANDING LAW ENFORCEMENT\nWORK. I IN PARTICULAR WANT TO GIVE A\nHEARTFELT THANKS TO THE NEW JERSEY POLICE OFFICERS WHO WERE\nABLE TO APPREHEND THIS INDIVIDUAL.\nI HAD A CHANCE TO TALK TO THEM BRIEFLY BEFORE I CAME DOWN TO MY\nMEETINGS HERE. THEY WERE IN GOOD SPIRITS AND I\nCOMMUNICATED TO THEM HOW APPRECIATIVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\nWERE AS WELL AS PEOPLE IN THE REGION.\n>> JOINING ME NOW IS FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT YMAN MOHYELDIN.\nHOW WERE THEY ABLE TO APPREHEND THIS INDIVIDUAL?\n>> Reporter: CHRIS, BY ANY MEASURE OF THE WORD, THIS WAS A\nLIGHTNING FAST INVESTIGATION. REALLY WITH TWO PARTS.\nONE, IDENTIFYING THE SUSPECT, IDENTIFYING THE MAN THAT THEY\nWANTED. TWO, ULTIMATELY APPREHENDING HIM\nON THE STREET BEHIND ME. THE FIRST PART OF THAT WAS\nTREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF INTELLIGENCE WORK, INVESTIGATIVE\nWORK, STARTING FROM THE SCENE OF THE EXPLOSIONS WITH THINGS LIKE\nTHE SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE THAT PUT AHMAD KHAN RAHAMI ON THE\nSCENE OF THAT BLOCK WHERE THE TWO EXPLOSIVES WERE IDENTIFIED,\nTHAT PRESSURE COOKER AND THE EXPLOSION THAT DETONATED.\nALSO FINGERPRINTS, A CELL PHONE PING THAT TRACED BACK TO ONE OF\nHIS CELL PHONES LED POLICE TO IDENTIFY HIM AS A PERSON OF\nINTEREST. ULTIMATELY, WHEN THEY WENT TO\nHIS HOUSE IN ELIZABETH NOT TOO FAR AWAY, SPOKE TO HIS FAMILY\nTHAT WAS LEAVING OR TRYING TO CROSS THE BRIDGE.\nTHEY WERE ABLE TO GET MORE INTELLIGENCE, MORE INFORMATION\nTHAT LED THEM TO PUT OUT THAT ALL NOTICE BULLETIN, IF YOU\nWILL, TO POLICE DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE TRI-STATE AREA.\nTHAT WAS THE FIRST PART OF THE INVESTIGATION.\nTHE SECOND PART REALLY ALMOST HAPPENED BY CHANCE ON THE STREET\nHERE RIGHT BEHIND ME. THAT WAS BECAUSE A BAR OWNER\nCOMING TO THAT BAR EARLY THIS MORNING SAW A MAN THAT WAS\nSLEEPING IN HIS DOORWAY. HE THOUGHT HE WAS A HOMELESS\nPERSON. HE CALLED THE POLICE.\nTHE POLICE SHOWED UP AT THE DOORWAY AND THE POLICE OFFICER\nTHAT ARRIVED THERE IMMEDIATELY KNEW THAT THAT WAS A SUSPECT\nTHEY WERE LOOKING FOR. .\nE HE SAID HE RECOGNIZED HIM BECAUSE OF HIS BEARD.\nHE SAID TO SHOW HIM HIS HANDS. WHEN THE MAN THAT WAS LYING ON\nTHE GROUND REACHED FOR HIS JACKET AND PULLED OUT A GUN,\nSHOT THE POLICE OFFICER TWICE, THE POLICE OFFICER THEN RANG OUT\nSHOTS FIRED ON THE RADIO AND THAT TRIGGERED A MASSIVE POLICE\nCRUSH ON THE TO THE AREA WHERE A SHOOTOUT ENSUED LEADING TO THE\nAPPREHENSION OF AHMAD KHAN RAHAMI.\n>> AYMAN MOHYELDIN, THANK YOU FOR THAT UPDATE.\nREALLY APPRECIATE IT.",

A POLICE CAR PULLED UP TO THAT\nMAN AND HE SAID THAT MAN FIRED FOUR TO SIX SHOTS AT THE POLICE\nCAR AND THAT'S WHEN THEY STARTED RUNNING AND MORE POLICE FOLLOWED\nAND THAT'S WHEN THERE WAS A SHOOTOUT.\nJENNA: YOU ALSO HEARD FROM THE MAYOR'S OFFICE IN LYNDON, NEW\nJERSEY THAT THERE ARE REPORTS THAT AN OFFICER MAY HAVE BEEN\nINJURED IN ALL OF THIS. WE ARE GOING TO LOOK TO CLARIFY.\nI WANT TO REFER TO SOME REPORTING WE HAVE FROM OUR VERY\nOWN KATHERINE WHO IS REPORTING ON THIS SECOND TO NONE.\nSHE HAS INFORMATION ON WHAT HAPPENED TO MINNESOTA AS WELL AS\nTHE NEW YORK SUSPECT. LET'S START WITH THE NEW YORK\nSUSPECT FIRST BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT\nINFORMATION. ACCORDING TO HER FEDERAL LAW\nENFORCEMENT SOURCE, RAHAMI WAS NOT UNKNOWN, APPARENTLY THERE\nHAD BEEN PRIOR CONTACT WITH AUTHORITIES BUT HAPPENED SOME\nTIME AGO BUT WAS NOT RECENT. WE WILL GET MORE INFORMATION ON\nTHAT TIMELINE. WHAT RECENT IN ALL OF THIS MEANS\nWILL MATTER. SHE ALSO HAD ADDITIONAL SOURCE\nTHAT HE WAS NOT IN THE TERROR WATCH LIST.\nHERE IS WHAT WE ARE LEARNING FROM HER.\nDID THEY KNOW ABOUT RAHAMI AND THIS IS PERHAPS WHY WE WERE ABLE\nTO IDENTIFY THE SUSPECT AS EARLY AS LAW ENFORCEMENT WAS ABLE TO\nAFTER BREAKING NEWS ON SATURDAY. HERE WE ARE MONDAY MORNING.\nIT LOOKS LIKE HE IS IN CUSTODY. OF COURSE, WE WANT TO BE CAREFUL\nWITH THAT UNTIL WE GET CONFIRMATION FROM THE POLICE\nDEPARTMENT. NO THE MEANTIME, I WANT TO ADD\nTHIS, AS THERE'S ALL SORTS OF ALLEGATIONS BUT THERE'S ALL\nSORTS OF DESCRIPTIONS, WE DON'T KNOW IF HE'S LINKED TO ISIS OR\nANY ORGANIZATION AT THIS POINT. WE DO KNOW THAT ISIS IS CLAIMING\nRESPONSIBILITY IN MINNESOTA FOR THE STABBING ATTACKS THAT\nHAPPENED THERE AND ACCORDING TO KATHERINE, LAW ENFORCEMENT SAID\nTHAT THE SUSPECT WAS NOT ON THE FED'S RADAR WHICH IS AN\nINTERESTING TWIST AS WE SEE WHO THE GOVERNMENT IS AWARE OF AND\nWHO THEY'VE NOT AWARE OF. >> WAS HE POTENTIALLY\nSELF-RADICALIZED, IS HE PART OF OTHERS?\nTHERE WAS AN ARREST OF FIVE MEN POTENTIALLY HEAD TO GO JFK\nINTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. NEW JERSEY HAS BEEN A HOT BED OF\nRADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR, HIS FOLLOWERS SHOT FIRST RADICAL\nISLAMIST TERRORIST ATTACK IN THE UNITED STATES ON NOVEMBER 5TH,\n1990, THEY WENT ON THE BOMB THE WORLD TRADE CENTER IN '93,\nLANDMARK PLOT TO BOMB LANDMARKS IN NEW YORK CITY INCLUDING\nUNITED NATIONS AND ONE OF THE TANLS BEFORE THEY WERE\nPROSECUTED. THAT ALL HAPPENING IN THE SAME\nNORTHERN NEW JERSEY AREA FROM A MOSQUE IN NEWARK.\nTHAT RAISES MANY QUESTIONS WHETHER THERE'S BEEN TERROR PLOT\nPERHAPS AND RAMANI WAS POTENTIALLY ONE OF THE MEMBERS.\nJENNA: BIG QUESTION NOW, WHO IS HE WORKING WITH, IF ANYBODY.\nTHAT WILL ONLY TAKES US SO FAR. EXCELLENT JOURNALIST WITH\nBREAKING NEWS IS TELLING US AS WELL THAT MULTIPLE LAW\nENFORCEMENTS ARE TELLING HIM THAT THE SUSPECT IS, INDEED,\nCUSTODY AFTER THE SHOOTOUT WITH POLICE IN LINDEN, NEW JERSEY.\nI WANT TO TALK TO TOM JOSSLYN. TOM, YOU'LL BE FAMILIAR IS WITH\nTHE FOUNDATION FOR DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACIES SENIOR EDITOR WHICH\nIS AN EXCELLENT SOURCE AS WELL FOR ANYTHING TERROR RELATED.\nTOM, EVERYBODY IS LOOKING FOR CONNECTIONS, WHERE IS HE, WHERE\nDOES HE COME FROM? WHAT'S GOING TO YOUR HEAD AS YOU\nLISTENING TO THE NEWS AS THEY BREAK?\n>> UNTIL WE GET SPECIFIC DATA WE DON'T REALLY -- JENNA: DOES IT\nMATTER WHO HE IS CONNECTED TO IF HE WANTS TO KILL OR INJURY\nAMERICANS? >> I MEAN, IT DOESN'T MATTER IN\nTERMS OF THE END PROTECT OF TRYING TO KILL OR WOUND\nAMERICANS BUT MATTERS IN TERMS OF INVESTIGATING THE\nORGANIZATIONS POSSIBLE AT PLAY, FOR SURE.\nRAHAMI WAS WELL KNOWN TO FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT, YOU THINK SAN\nBERNARDINO, BOSTON BOMBERS, IN EACH CASE THERE WERE KNOWN\nSUSPECTS WHO CARRIED OUT ATTACKS, THEY WERE IDENTIFIED BY\nLAW ENFORCEMENT AS BEING THREAT BEFOREHAND AND WENT ONTO CARRY\nAN ATTACK. THEY SPEAK TO THE FACT THAT\nTHERE ARE MORE THREATS THAN EVER AND BASICALLY THE FBI ARE\nTRACKING MORE INDIVIDUALS THAN EVER, WHAT IT MEANS THAT THE\nLONE WOLVES GET THROUGH. JENNA: WE ARE LOOKING AT ANY\nPARALLELS BETWEEN ATTACKS, WE DON'T THINK THEY'RE CONNECTED\nBUT WE DO KNOW ABOUT RAHAMI THAT HE HAS REACHED TO AFGHANISTAN.\nWE KNEW ABOUT OMAR MATEEN AS WELL, CONNECTIONS TO AFGHANISTAN\nAND WHEN WE LOOK AT SAN BERNARDINO, THERE'S CONNECTIONS\nBACK TO AFGHANISTAN, PAKISTAN REGION AS WELL.\nWHAT DO YOU MAKE OF JUST THOSE TIES TO THAT PARTICULAR PART OF\nTHE WORLD, TOM? >> WELL, AFGHANISTAN AND\nPAKISTAN HAS BEEN THE EPICENTER BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS IT\nDOESN'T SURPRISE THAT IMMIGRANT, PEOPLE TIE TODAY THAT REGION ARE\nTIED TO JIHADI ETIOLOGY. THERE'S A LOT WE STILL HAVE TO\nLEARN ABOUT RAHAMI AND WHAT WENT DOWN BUT SHOULDN'T SURPRISE IF\nHE HAS TIES TO ORGANIZATIONS OVERSEAS.\nJENNA: CONNECTIONS ONLINE, WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD BY WAY OF\nCHATTER, WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN OVER THIS WEEKEND, NOT ONLY FROM WHAT\nWE ARE SEEING IN THE NEW YORK AREA BUT ATTACKS IN MINNESOTA?\n>> I THINK THERE'S A DIFFERENCE FROM THE CHATTER I HAVE SEEN IN\nNEW JERSEY, I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY SPECIFIC CLAIMS OF\nRESPONSIBILITY. THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN\nMINNESOTA, A MOCK NEWS AGENCY, CHIEF PROPAGANDA ARMS OF ISLAMIC\nSTATE, ISIS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT\nOPERATION AND SAID IT WAS A SOLDIER OF CALIPHATE THAT\nCARRIED IT OUT. WHEN THEY CLAIM SOMETHING,\nTHERE'S A LEAD THERE, A TIE THERE BACK TO THE MOTHERSHIP AND\nSO THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND.\nTHAT'S A BIG DISTINCTION. IN MINNESOTA WE HAVE A SPECIFIC\nCLAIM RESPONSIBILITY THAT NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED FURTHER BUT I\nWOULD SAY THE EVIDENCE OF THE PROBABILITY IS THERE'S MORE TO\nTHAT STORY. HERE WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR\nSUCH A CLAIM TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER OR NOT THIS GUY HAS TIED\nTO ORGANIZATION. JENNA: YOU JUST SAW REPORTER\nFROM ANOTHER STATION POP UP, WE ARE USING AS MUCH LIFE FEEDS WE\nCAN TO SHOW YOU OF THE SCENE AND PERHAPS CATCH ANYTHING OF WHAT\nUNFOLDED THERE. ACCORDING TO EYEWITNESS REPORTS,\nAGAIN, AN EYEWITNESS REPORTS NOTORIOUSLY UNRELIABLE BUT THEY\nGIVE US CONTEXT, PERHAPS OF WHAT HAPPENED ON THIS VERY STREET.\nTHAT THERE SHALL THERE WAS A MAN WALKING DOWN THE STREET WITH A\nGUN IN HIS HAND, A POLICE CAR PULLED UP NEXT TO THE MAN AND\nTHE MAN TOOK FOUR TO SIX SHOTS TO THE POLICE CAR.\nTHAT'S OUR FIRST ACCOUNT AS TO HOW MAYBE THE POLICE WERE ABLE\nTO FIND THE WITNESS, THE ALLEGED SUSPECT IN THE MANHATTAN-NEW\nJERSEY BOMBINGS. WE ARE GETTING CONFIRMATION THAT\nTHE SUSPECT IS IN CUSTODY AND WE ARE WORKING AS WELL TO GET\nIMAGES AND WHAT WE CAN TO SHOW YOU EXACTLY WHAT HAS TRANSPIRED\nIN A RAINY DAY IN NEW JERSEY, JUST IN THE NEIGHBORING TOWN\nFROM ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY WHERE RAHAMI LIVED.\nERIC, YOU HAVE MORE INFORMATION? >> THEY QUOTE, GOT HIM AND THEY\nSAY THE SUSPECT HAS BEEN SHOT IN THE SHOULDER AND THAT TWO POLICE\nOFFICERS HAD BEEN SHOT. ONE SAVED BY THE VEST,\nPOTENTIALLY ANOTHER ONE IN MORE SERIOUS CONDITION BUT WE DON'T\nHAVE ANY OTHER DETAILS ON THAT. JENNA: INTERESTING THAT HE WOULD\nBE WALKING DOWN THE STREET IF EYEWITNESS REPORT IS TRUE.\nAT LEAST A LOT MORE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS.\nTHAT'S WHAT WE HAVE NOW. MICHAEL IS BACK WITH US.\nFORMER HOMELAND SECURITY ADVISER.\nTHIS GUY IS PROBABLY KNOWN TO LAW ENFORCEMENT IF WE HAVE AN\nIMAGE AND A NAME SO QUICKLY. >> THAT'S RIGHT.\nTHAT INDICATES THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT WAS ABLE TO AT LEAST\nIDENTIFY HIM QUICKLY BASED UPON PRIOR INFORMATION.\nWE DON'T KNOW WHEN THAT SURVEILLANCE WAS.\nWE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT TOOK BUT THAT'S ONE OF THE KEY\nINDICATIONS BECAUSE OF THE SPEED AT WHICH THEY IDENTIFIED WHERE\nTHE INDIVIDUAL LIVED, THEIR BUSINESS AND WE WERE ABLE TO\nTRACK DOWN THIS VEHICLE WHICH WE ARE LEARNING MORE ABOUT AS IT\nWAS HEADING OVER HORIZONTAL BRIDGE, PERHAPS TO AIRPORT BUT\nHASN'T BEEN CONFIRMED, IN FACT, THEY DID HAVE MORE INFORMATION\nON THE INDIVIDUAL. SO NOW THE QUESTION IS WHERE DID\nHE GET THE GUN, WHERE WAS HE GOING, WHO WAS HE GOING TO TALK\nTO AND WHAT TYPE OF SUPPORT DID HE HAVE AND WHAT WAS THE NET\nWORTH OUTSIDE OF INDIVIDUALS? JENNA: ACCORDING TO REPORTS ON\nTHE GROUND, THIS IS THE BALANCE THAT HAS THE SUSPECT INSIDE.\nACCORDING TO WHAT WE ARE HEARING HE WAS B, INDEED, SHOT BY POLICE\nAND POLICE WERE ALSO WOUNDED IN ALL OF THIS.\nMICHAEL, IT'S IMPORTANT TO MENTION HE'S ALIVE.\nSO AT THIS POINT, NOW WHAT, WHEN DO INVESTIGATORS GET TO TALK TO\nAND ANSWER QUESTIONS THAT YOU'RE POSING AS WELL?\n>> OBVIOUSLY HE'S GOING TO HAVE HIS RIGHTS AND OPPORTUNITY TO\nHAVE COUNSEL. OBVIOUSLY READ MIRANDA RIGHTS\nAND TRY TO GET AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE.\nI HAVE TO TAKE A MOMENT WHAT AMAZING POLICE WORK THIS HAS\nBEEN TO HAVE THE EVENT ON SATURDAY AND THEN GO AND GET THE\nGUY, IF IN FACT, THIS IS THE GUY, RIGHT NOW MONDAY MORNING,\nTHAT'S AMAZING AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD REALLY\nTAKE OUR HATS OFF TO A COORDINATED MULTIAGENCY EFFORT\nHERE. THE JOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCE,\nCITY OF NEW YORK PD, NEW JERSEY, EVERYBODY WORKING TOGETHER.\nTHAT'S THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO WORK.\nJENNA: IT IS GREAT AND SO GRATEFUL FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT,\nMIELLAL, THIS IS INDEED THE CASE, WE CONCLUDE THE CHAPTER AS\nTO THE SUSPECT WHO ACTUALLY PLACED THE BOND IN THE EFFORT TO\nKILL -- TO KILL AMERICANS. >> THAT APPARENTLY IS THE\nSUSPECT RIGHT THERE. >> HE VERY MUCH RESEMBLES IN\nTERMS OF THE MUG SHOT. MAYBE WE CAN GET THE MUG SHOTS\nSO WE CAN COMPARE ON THIS TAPE. >> LOOKS LIKE IT'S MATCHING THE\nDESCRIPTION WE ARE RECEIVING FROM THE MAYOR'S OFFICE FROM\nEYEWITNESSES. HERE IT IS AGAIN TORGT TO AN\nEYEWITNESS THIS IS OUR FIRST DESCRIPTION OF WHAT HAPPENED, A\nMAN -- THIS MAN WAS WALKING DOWN THE STREET WITH A GUN AND\nSTOPPED BY POLICE AND ENGAGED THE POLICE, THERE WAS A SHOOTOUT\nTHAT TOOK PLACE, ONE OFFICER WAS SHOT, APPARENTLY SAVED BY HIS\nVEST, ANOTHER OFFICER WAS INJURED BY FRAGMENTS.\nBY THE WAY, WILL GET THE BEST TREATMENT AVAILABLE.\nWE WILL BE ALLOWED, OF COURSE, AS THE RIGHT OF EVERY AMERICAN\nTO GET REPRESENTATION. >> MICHAEL, DO YOU THINK HE'S\nGOING TO TALK? SO OFTEN TIMES THEY ARE SO\nDEDICATED, THEY ARE SO IN THE IDEOLOGY OF ISLAM, DO YOU THINK\nHE'S GOING TO GIVE UP ANYTHING OR KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT?\n>> OBVIOUSLY DEPENDING ON WHAT STATE OF MIND HE WAS.\nTHE FACT THAT HE WAS CARRYING A WEAPON, HE WAS LOOKING DEATH BY\nPOLICE OFFICER, DEATH BY COP, LOOKING TO PERHAPS END IT.\nNOBODY WALKS WITH A WEAPON AND DOESN'T EXPECT TO GET PICKED UP.\nTHAT'S PROBABLY THE STATE OF MIND THAT YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE A\nLOOK AT. WHAT INVESTIGATORS ARE GOING TO\nDO IS ISOLATE HIM AND TALK TO EVERYBODY AROUND HIM AND FIND\nLEVERAGE POINTS TO GET TO HIM. BUT THERE IS A LOT OF PRESSURE\nRIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE ARE OTHER CELLS OUT\nTHERE. JENNA: YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT\nTO COMPLEMENT LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE ARE SO GRATEFUL IF WHAT YOU\nARE ABLE TO SEE OR HEAR WHICH IS INCREDIBLE WORK OF MULTIPLE LAW\nENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. IT BEGS THE QUESTION ABOUT WHAT\nELSE, WHO IS NEXT? IF THIS GUY WAS, INDEED,\nWATCHED, WHY WEREN'T WE ABLE TO GET BEFORE HE PLACED THE BOMB IN\nNEW JERSEY AND BEFORE HE PLACED IT IN CHELSEA AND POTENTIALLY\nKILLED PEOPLE THERE, THANKFULLY NOBODY AT THAT TIME?\n>> JENNA, THAT IS ALWAYS A QUESTION THAT'S PRESENT NOW\nSINCE THE MISSION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS CHANGED.\nIT'S NO LONGER ABOUT INVESTIGATING AN ACT ARRESTING\nAN INDIVIDUAL AND BRINGING THEM TO JUSTICE, IT'S NOW ABOUT\nPREVENTING THE ACT BUT WE HAVE FOUND SO MUCH IS THAT\nINTELLIGENCE, YOU AND I TALKED ABOUT THIS IN MANY OCCASIONS,\nINTELLIGENCE IS NOT A SIGN IT'S AN ART FORM.\nPICK THE RIGHT ONE, WATCH THE RIGHT PERSON AND POUNCE ON THEM\nRIGHT BEFORE THEY'RE ABOUT TO DO THEIR ACT IS INCREDIBLY COMPLEX,\nDIFFICULT AND THIS IS THE PRESSURE THAT MEN AND WOMEN WHO\nWORK IN A JOINT TERRIFIC -- TERRORISM TASK FORCE, I WAS ON\nTHE LIR COMING INTO NEW YORK, LONG ISLAND RAILROAD AND\nEVERYBODY'S CELL PHONE WENT OFF WITH A BE ON THE LOOK OUT.\nJENNA: WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT? THAT'S THE FIRST WE HAVE SEEN\nSOMETHING LIKE THAT. >> ALERT SYSTEM SET UP WHERE\nTHEY ARE DOING DIGITIZED, BE ON THE LOOK OUT FOR.\nIT WAS AN AMAZING EVENT. EVERYBODY IN THE TRAIN CAR GOT\nIT. SOME PEOPLE RECOGNIZED ME, WHAT\nIS THIS, NOW THE ALERT THAT WE ARE GOING TO GET ON THE PHONES\nAND SO IT'S -- IT HAD THE INDIVIDUAL'S PICTURE.\nTHAT'S NOW THE KIND OF DIGITAL NET WE CAN THROW OVER TO TRY AND\nGET A SUSPECT AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.\n>> MICHAEL, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE FACT THAT VERY SIMILAR TO\nTHE TSARNAEV BROTHERS, ALLEGEDLY WALKING DOWN THE STREET BEFORE A\nSHOOTOUT. >> WHY DID THEY PICK THAT AREA,\nIT'S NOT ICONIC, IT WAS NOT -- A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE STREET BUT\nNOT CERTAINLY LIKE TIME SQUARE WOULD BE.\nTHAT INDICATES TO ME THEY WE WANTED TO ESCAPE BECAUSE THEY\nCOULD PUT DEVICE AND GET AWAY SAFELY BUT TO HAVE A WEAPON, HE\nFIGURED IT'S UP I MIGHT AS WELL GO OUT WITH A BLAZE OF GLORY.\n>> THE NUMBER OF BOMBS? >> THAT MEANS THAT THEY REALLY\nMEANT TO SPREAD THE CARNAGE AND LOOKING FOR SOFT SITES BUT IF,\nIN FACT, THE MARINE CORPS RUN IS IMPLICATED IN THIS, IT'S NOT\nBEEN CONFIRMED BUT THAT'S A PART OF THE PLAY BOOK THAT WE HAVE\nSEEN SINCE 9/11 OF TRYING TO -- >> THAT CERTAINLY SHOWS A\nPOTENTIAL MOTIVE GOING AFTER OUR MILITARY.\nWE ARE GOING TO THROW TO OUR COLLEAGUE WITH THE LATEST ON THE\nDEVELOPING STORY. >> THANKS, ERIC, JENNA, THE NEWS\nTHAT WE HAVE AT THIS HOUR COMING IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES UAHMED\nIS IN CUSTODY AFTER SHOOTOUT WITH POLICE.\nTHIS IS THE PICTURE OF THIS SUSPECT TAKEN INTO CUSTODY A\nSHORT TIME AGO IN NEARBY LINDEN, NEW JERSEY.\nAS YOU KNOW, THE AUTHORITIES HAD SENT OUT TEXT MESSAGES WITH ALL\nOF THESE PICTURES TO MILLIONS OF RESIDENTS IN THE AREA AND IT WAS\nAFTER THAT RELEASE OF THESE PICTURES THAT THE SUSPECT\nSOMEHOW CAME INTO CONTACT WITH POLICE.\nNOW, WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER POLICE APPROACHED HIM AND THERE\nWAS A SHOOTOUT, WHETHER HE RECOGNIZED POLICE IN THE AREA\nWHERE HE WAS AND BEGAN TO ENGAGE THOSE POLICE, BUT WE DO KNOW THE\nFOLLOWING FROM MULTIPLE REPORTING ON SCENE, MULTIPLE\nOFFICERS ENCOUNTERED THIS MAN. ONE OFFICER WAS SHOT, ACCORDING\nTO AUTHORITIES ON SEEN, THOUGH HE WAS WEARING A BULLET PROOF\nVEST. DETAIL OF INJURIES ARE NOT\nAVAILABLE TO US BUT WE DO KNOW THE BULLET PROOF WAS IN PLACE\nAND MAY HAVE BEEN IN -- OF HELP. AN EXPLOSION IN CHELSEA\nNEIGHBORHOOD OF NEW YORK CITY. THIS WAS IN THE EARLY TO MID\nEVENING HOURS THERE AROUND 23RD STREET SUBWAY STATION, SOME\nWHERE AROUND 26TH STREET, THERE WAS ONE EXPLOSION, THE ENTIRE\nAREA OFF AND A SHORT TIME LATER ANOTHER DEVICE FOUND INSIDE I\nBELIEVE A TRASH CAN SEEN WITH WIRES, ET CETERA, COMING OFF OF\nIT, IT APPEARED TO BE A PIPE BOMB.\nTHIS IS THE MAN WHO HAS BEEN BROUGHT INTO CUSTODY.\nTHIS IS HE ON THE STRETCHER, VIDEO OBTAINED BY FOX NEWS, HE\nHAS THEN BEEN TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL, LIVE NEWS CONFERENCE\nGOING ON ABC TELEVISION, THIS IS THE MAYOR OF LINDEN OF NEW\nJERSEY, LET'S LISTEN. >> WE WERE ABLE TO ACTUALLY TAKE\nHIM DOWN. >> IS HIS CAR DOWN THE STREET?\nI KNOW WE ARE A LITTLE BIT AWAY FROM WHERE THIS WAS GOING ON,\nEVERYBODY WAS LOOKING FOR HONDA 2003?\n>> OUR INVESTIGATION WAS TURNED TO THE FBI.\nTHEY ARE THE LEAD ON THIS. THE FBI IS THE LEAD ON THEM I'M\nSURE THEY'RE LOOKING TO ASPECTS OF THIS.\nI'M NOT PRIVY TO ANY DETAILS AT THIS POINT.\n>> HE WAS SHOT WHERE, THE ARM, THE LEG, I KNOW HE WAS HE WAS\nSHOT SEVERAL TIMES AND CONSCIOUS AND AWAKE ON THE GROUND, ONE\nSHOT IN THE LEG AND MAYBE A SHOT IN THE ARM BUT HE WAS CONSCIOUS\nAND AWAKE WHEN HE WAS TAKEN IN CUSTODY.\n>> THEY ARE WORKING ON CHARGES. >> MORE THAN ONE.\nWE DON'T KNOW THE NUMBER. >> WE DON'T KNOW THE NUMBER.\nSEVERAL SHOTS. >> AND THE OFFICERS ARE OKAY?\n>> THE OFFICERS APPEAR TO BE OKAY.\nWE HAD THREE OFFICERS WHO WERE TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL, ONE WITH\nBULLET FRAGMENT WHICH HIT HIM IN THE HEAD AND THE OTHER SHOT IN\nTHE VEST AND ONE OF OUR OFFICERS, I THINK, HE HAS HIGH\nBLOOD PRESSURE, HE'S BEEN EVALUATED AS WELL.\n>> FOR STRESS? >> YES, I WOULD SAY.\n>> TRAUMATIC EVENT, ABSOLUTELY. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH.\n>> ABOUT 10:30 THIS MORNING. WE HAD A GENTLEMAN THAT WAS\nSLEEPING IN THE DOORWAY OF A LOCAL BUSINESS, A BAR, THE CALL\nCAME IN FROM THE OWNER OF THE BAR WHO WAS OUTSIDE THE\nBUSINESS, OUR OFFICERS RESPOND TODAY CHECK OUT THIS PERSON.\nAT THAT POINT THE OFFICER WAS APPROACHING HIM AND TRYING TO\nROUSE HIM. THE OFFICER TOLD THE PERSON TO\nSHOW ME YOUR HANDS, THE GENTLEMAN HAD HIS HAND AND\nSOMETHING ON THE SIDE OF THE BODY AND PULLED OUT A HANDGUN\nAND FIRED A SHOT AT THE OFFICER STRIKING HIM IN THE ABDOMEN.\nTHEY WERE PREPARING HIM TO BE REMOVED FROM THE SCENE.\nLIKE I SAID, THE FBI WAS ON THE SCENE AND THEY'RE DOING THEIR\nINVESTIGATION. I'M SORRY?\n>> TO WHAT HOSPITAL? >> I DON'T KNOW, WE ARE JUST\nASSISTING THEM AT THIS POINT. >> THE GUN WAS RECOVERED?\n>> THE GUN THAT HE HAD? >> AS FAR AS I KNOW, YES.\n>> ANY OTHER WEAPONS OR BOMBS? >> NOT THAT I'M AWARE.\nIT'S A VERY ACTIVE CRIME SCENE. >> DO YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF GUN\nHE HAD? >> POSSIBLY AN AUTOMATIC\nHANDGUN. THAT'S ALL I KNOW.\nJUST LISTENING TO THE TRANSMISSION THAT IS HE WAS\nDISCHARGING WEAPON. THAT'S CORRECT.\n[INAUDIBLE] >> FIRING THE WEAPON, POSSIBLY\nAT PASSING VEHICLES. >> AND THE ONE THAT GOT SHOT IN\nTHE ABDOMEN OR CHEST -- >> THE ABDOMEN AREA.\n>> HE HAD HIS BULLET PROOF VEST ON SO SHAKEN UP BUT HE WILL BE\nOKAY. THE OTHER OFFICER SUSTAINED SOME\nTYPE OF INJURY TO FACIAL AREA SO WE ARE HOPING HE WILL BE OKAY\nAND THE THIRD OFFICER WAS COMPLAINING OF BLOOD PRESSURE\nISSUES SO HE WAS TRANSPORTED TO BE EVALUATED.\n>> WAS HE SLEEPING IN THE HONDA? >> I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT A\nHONDA, I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT A VEHICLE AT THIS POINT.\nI WAS TOLD HE WAS SLEEPING IN THE DOORWAY OF A LOCAL BUSINESS,\nTHAT'S ALL I KNOW. >> CAN WE GIVE THE NAME AND\nTITLE FOR THE RECORD? >> THE POLICE CAPTAIN AND MAYOR\nGIVING US NEWS AND WELCOME INFORMATION TODAY.\nIF YOU SEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING WORKED TODAY IN\nLINDEN, NEW JERSEY FOR THE GREATER TRI STATE AREA FOR\nLINDEN AND AMERICANS FROM COAST TO COAST, A RESTAURANT OWNER\nAPPARENTLY SAW A MAN SLEEPING ACCORDING TO WITNESSES OF THE\nAUTHORITIES YOU JUST HEARD SLEEPING IN THE DOORWAY OF SOME\nSORT OF BUILDING, HE NOTIFIED AUTHORITY THAT IS THERE WAS A\nSUSPICIOUS MAN THERE.

SIMPSON\" RECEIVED NINE EMMYS\nINCLUDING WINS FOR BEST LIMITED SERIES, WRITING AND THREE STARS.\nEARLY IN THE EVENING, HOST JIMMY KIMMEL JOKED ABOUT A RULES\nCHANGE WITH THE EMMYS. >> WE'RE GOING TO DO THINGS A\nLITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY THIS YEAR.\nTHIS YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, YOU MUST BE PRESENT TO\nWIN. IF WE CALL YOUR NAME AND YOU ARE\nNOT HERE TO ACCEPT, THE EMMY GOES TO THE NEXT NAME ON THE\nLIST. IT'S CALLED THE MAGGIE SMITH\nRULE. AND THIS, IF YOU DON'T KNOW\nMAGGIE SMITH, SHE HAS BEEN NOMINATED FOR THE EMMY NINE\nTIMES, WON THREE TIMES. HOW MANY TIMES DO YOU THINK\nSHE'S SHOWN UP TO GET THE EMMY? NO TIMES.\nTHIS YEAR, SHE HAD A SUNDAY CERAMICS CLASS SHE COULDN'T GET\nOUT OF. >> AND THE EMMY GOES TO MAGGIE\nSMITH, \"DOWNTON ABBEY.\" >> MAGGIE COULDN'T BE HERE\nTONIGHT SO ACCEPTING THE AWARD ON --\n>> NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. WE'RE NOT MAILING THIS TO HER.\nMAGGIE, IF YOU WANT THIS, IT WILL BE IN THE LOST AND FOUND.\n>> TO BREAK IT DOWN FOR US, LET'S BRINGING IN KIM SERAFIN,\nTHE SENIOR EDITOR OF IN TOUCH WEEKLY AND JOINS FROM US\nLOS ANGELES. IT'S ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO HAVE\nYOU WITH US. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHO THE BIG\nWINNERS WERE AND WHO WAS EXPECTED TO TAKE HOME THE MOST\nTROPHIES. >> YEAH, WITH THE EMMYS, WHAT\nHAPPENS EVERY YEAR, THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF REPEAT WINNERS\nDESERVEDLY. BUT THEY SEEM TO REPEAT AND WIN\nAGAIN AND AGAIN. I THINK EVERYONE EXPECTED, FOR\nEXAMPLE, \"GAME OF THRONES\" TO WIN FOR BEST DRAMA SERIES.\nIT DEFINITELY DESERVED TO WIN, ONE OF THE MOST TALKED ABOUT\nSHOWS WITH A VERY PASSIONATE FAN BASE.\nTHIS WAS A VERY GOOD WIN FOR BEST DRAMA AND \"VEEP\" WON FOR\nBEST COMEDY YEAR. THIS IS ANOTHER SHOW THEY HAD A\nREALLY, REALLY GOOD YEAR, A REALLY GOOD SEASON.\nI THINK IN A POLITICAL YEAR, I THINK PEOPLE EXPECTED \"VEEP\"\nWOULD WIN AGAIN. AT LEAST IT'S NOT \"MODERN\nFAMILY\" WINNING FOR I THINK FIVE YEARS IN A ROW.\n\"VEEP\" COULD BECOME THE SHOW THAT WINS OVER AND OVER AGAIN.\nJULIETTE LOUIS-DREYFUS WON FOR \"VEEP\" AGAIN BUT SHE HAD A FAK\nYEAR. AND JEFFREY TAM BORE WON FOR\n\"TRANSPARENT\" AGAIN. SO MUCH SO PEOPLE EXPECTED HIM\nTO WIN, JIMMY KIMMEL GAVE HIM HIS AWARD BEFORE THEY EVEN\nSTARRED PASSING OUT AWARDS, HE GAVE HIM HIS AWARD BECAUSE\nEVERYONE ASSUMED HE WOULD PROBABLY WIN AND HE DID.\n>> YOU WOULD THINK WITH ALL OF THE POLITICAL HEADLINES THAT\nWE'RE COVERING HERE THAT PEOPLE WOULD GET ENOUGH WITH POLITICS\nBUT YEAH, \"VEEP\" DOING PRETTY WELL.\nPEOPLE LIKE THOSE POLITICAL SHOWS ESPECIALLY THAT'S WHAT\nPEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. THERE WERE ALSO SOME SURPRISES\nAND NEW FACES. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THOSE?\n>> YEAH, IT WAS FLEISS TO SEE A FEW NEWCOMERS WIN IS ALWAYS\nGREAT. RAMI MALIK WON FOR \"MR. ROBOT.\"\nPEOPLE EXPECTED HIM TO WIN BECAUSE HE'S GOTTEN SO MUCH\nATTENTION. EVERYONE ASSUMED HE WOULD WIN\nAND YOU DON'T HAVE JON HAMM ANYMORE WHO PEOPLE WERE ALWAYS\nTALKING ABOUT SO A LOT OF PERENNIAL WINNERS WEREN'T THERE.\nHE WON DESERVEDLY FOR MR. ROBOT. TATIANA WON FOR ORPHAN BLACK.\nFOR SO MANY YEARS, SHE WAS NEVER EVEN NOMINATED.\nPEOPLE WOULD SAY WHERE IS TATIANA MASANI.\nSHE PLAYS CLONES. SHE'S GOT A REALLY, REALLY TOUGH\nJOB. THIS MADE SENSE SHE FINALLY WON\nAND IT WAS NICE TO SEE TWO NEW FACES.\nALTHOUGH HER NAME WAS KIND OF MISPRO NOUNSDS WHEN SHE WON.\nHOPEFULLY NOW PEOPLE WILL BECOME MORE FAMILIAR WITH HER.\n>> WHAT ABOUT THE NOMINATION OF TRACEE ELLIS ROSS.\n>> THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT TO SEE HER WIN.\n\"BLACK-ISH\" IS SUCH A POPULAR SHOW.\nTHE SHOW WAS NOMINATED. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT TO SEE\nIT NOMINATED. EVEN JIMMY KIMMEL MADE A COMMENT\nABOUT THE DIVERSITY IN THE EMMY NOMINATIONS AS OPPOSED TO WHAT\nPEOPLE TALKS ABOUT WITH THE OSCARS SO WHITISH.\nYOU REALLY DO SEE A LOT OF DIVERSITY WITH THE EMMYS.\nA LOT OF TV SHOWS REFLECT REAL LIFE.\nSO HOPEFULLY, TRACEE ELLIS ROSS WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO WIN.\nBLACKISH IS ON THE AIR FOR A LONG TIME.\nPEOPLE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEE IT WIN THIS TIME AROUND.\nITS TIME WILL BE COMING FOR SURE.\n>> KIM SERAFIN SENIOR EDITOR FROM \"INTOUCH WEEKLY,\" THANK YOU\nSO MUCH.",

THIS MORNING I TALKED ABOUT THE\nFACT THAT THERE WAS A PERSON OF INTEREST THAT THE FBI AND LAW\nENFORCEMENT HAD IDENTIFIED WITH RESPECT TO THE BOMBS THAT HAD\nBEEN PLANTED IN THE NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY AREA.\nAS EVERYBODY IS NOW AWARE, THAT INDIVIDUAL HAS BEEN APPREHENDED.\nI JUST WANT TO START BY COMMENTING ON THE EXTRAORDINARY\nWORK AND COORDINATION THAT'S TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN THE FBI AND\nLOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. FOR US TO BE ABLE TO APPREHEND A\nSUSPECT IN JUST A LITTLE OVER 24 HOURS AFTER AN EVENT TAKES PLACE\nLIKE THIS, IT IS OUTSTANDING POLICE WORK, OUTSTANDING LAW\nENFORCEMENT WORK. I, IN PARTICULAR, WANT TO GIVE A\nHEARTFELT THANKS TO THE NEW JERSEY POLICE OFFICERS WHO WERE\nABLE TO APPREHEND THIS INDIVIDUAL.\nI HAD A CHANCE TO TALK TO THEM BRIEFLY BEFORE I CAME DOWN TO MY\nMEETINGS HERE. THEY ARE GOING TO BE FINE.\nTHEY'VE SUSTAINED SOME MODEST INJURIES BUT ONES THAT THEY'LL\nRAPIDLY RECOVER FROM. THEY WERE IN GOOD SPIRITS.\nAND I COMMUNICATED TO THEM HOW APPRECIATIVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\nWERE, AS WELL AS PEOPLE IN THE REGION.\nIT'S JUST ONE MORE REMINDER OF THE KPRAERD SKILL AND SACRIFICE\nENKURNLD AND WHAT THEY PUT ON THE LINE EVERY SINGLE DAY TO\nMAKE SURE WE'RE SAFE. OBVIOUSLY INFORMATION IS STILL\nUNFOLDING ABOUT WHAT MIGHT MOT\nMOTIVATE. I WILL ALSO COMMENT ON THE FACT\nTHAT WITH RESPECT TO THE MINNESOTA STABBINGS THAT\nOCCURRED, I HAD A CHANCE TO TALK TO THE OFF-DUTY POLICE OFFICER\nTHERE WHO UNDOUBTEDLY SAVED A LOT OF LIVES AND PREVENTED\nFURTHER INJURY BECAUSE OF HIS QUICK AND EFFECTIVE ACTION.\nAND I TOLD HIM THAT ONCE AGAIN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE\nAPPRECIATIVE OF HIS WORK AND HIS HEROISM.\n>> SO THERE'S THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES MAKING HIS\nLATEST STATEMENT ON THESE TERROR INCIDENTS IN NEW YORK AND NEW\nJERSEY, ALSO SPEAKING ABOUT THE SLASHING THAT OCCURRED AT A MALL\nIN MINNESOTA. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MUCH MORE ON\nALL OF THIS. REPRESENTATIVE ANDRE CARSON A\nMEMBER OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE IS STILL WITH\nUS. THE SOURCE OF A LOT OF CONCERN\nRIGHT NOW, WE'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT THIS INDIVIDUAL, AHMAD\nKHAN RAHAMI, THAT HE NOT ONLY VISITED AFGHANISTAN, WHICH IS\nUNDERSTANDABLE, HIS FAMILY IS FROM AFGHANISTAN, HE WAS BORN IN\nAFGHANISTAN, HE'S A NATURALIZED NEW YORK CITIZEN.\nBUT SIDE TRIPS HE THEN MADE TO PAKISTAN, INCLUDING ONE VISIT\nFOR ALMOST A YEAR IN PAKISTAN. HE COMES BACK TO THE UNITED\nSTATES, HE HAS SECONDARY INTERVIEWS AND NO FLAGS WERE\nRAISED. IT'S NOT A CRIME TO GO TO SOUTH\nASIA. WHAT IS A PROBLEM IS THAT YOU\nHAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO FEEL DISILLUSIONED AND THEY NEED\nSOMEONE TO BLAME. THIS IS A TOUGH TIME FOR LAW\nENFORCEMENT AND I THINK THE BRAVERY THAT WAS SHOWN BY THE\nUNDERCOVER OFFICER THE OTHER DAY EXEMPLIFIES THE NEED FOR US TO\nSUPPORT OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY.\nTHEY'RE WORKING DILIGENTLY ALONG WITH THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY\nIN TRYING TO MAKE THE CONNECTIONS NECESSARY TO RID\nOURSELVES OF THIS GROWING TERRORIST THREAT.\n>> THE PROBLEM IS WE NOW KNOW HE SPENT ALMOST A YEAR IN PAKISTAN,\nINCLUDING SPENDING TIME IN AREAS THAT ARE HEAVILY CONTROLLED BY\nTHE TALIBAN. THAT WOULD RAISE A LOT OF RED\nFLAGS, AT LEAST TO ME, IF I WERE TALKING TO HIM UPON HIS RETURN.\n>> IT SHOULD RAISE MANY FLAGS, BUT WE CAN'T JUMP TO\nCONCLUSIONS. WHAT IS CLEAR IS THAT HE IS\nRESPONSIBLE FOR INJURING NUMEROUS AMERICANS AND HE NEEDS\nTO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT. >> HIS FRIENDS SAID UPON HIS\nRETURN HE SEEMED A DIFFERENT KIND OF PERSON.\nGREW A BEARD. SEEMED TO BE MORE RADICALIZED.\nI GUESS NOBODY PAID ATTENTION, OR AT LEAST ENOUGH ATTENTION TO\nTHAT. >> WOLF, AS YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT A\nCRIME TO HAVE A BEARD. >> NO.\n>> WHAT DOES HAPPEN WHEN WE START TO CAST ASPERSIONS ON\nPEOPLE BECAUSE OF THESE INCIDENCES.\nI THINK AS HUMAN BEINGS WE TEND TO PLACE HUMAN BEINGS IN BOXES.\nTHAT'S UNFORTUNATE. THERE ARE MUSLIMS IN LAW\nENFORCEMENT COMMUNITIES. I WAS ONE OF THEM, WORKED FOR\nTHE HOMELAND SECURITY AND WANTED TO MAKE AMERICA A SAFER PLACE.\nBUT WHAT IS CLEAR IS THAT MUSLIM LEADERS ARE FINDING THEMSELVES\nWANTING TO SPEAK UP. UNFORTUNATELY, YOU HAVE A GREAT\nDISTASTE OF THE GOVERNMENT. BUT NOW IS THE TIME TO PUSH THE\nEXTREMISM CATEGORY AND SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.\n>> BASED ON THE INFORMATION YOU'RE GETTING, DID HE WORK\nALONE, OR WERE THERE OTHERS, WHERE ARE THOSE INVESTIGATIONS\nAS FAR AS YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW? >> I'M NOT AT LIBERTY TO TALK\nABOUT ANYTHING, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN HE WAS ALONE, HE'S\nPROBABLY INSPIRED RECALLED. >> AGAIN, THE BOMB THAT WAS PUT\nTOGETHER IS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO A MAN OUTLINED.\n>> THERE IS AN ARTICLE ABOUT HOW TO BUILD A BOMB IN THE KITCHEN\nOF YOUR MOM. WE'RE GETTING MORE BREAKING\nNEWS. WE'LL TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND BE\nRIGHT BACK.",

AS SOON AS YOU FIND THOSE AND\nINVESTIGATE THEM, THERE WILL BE ENTER\nENTER VIEWERS OUT ACROSS NEW JERSEY AND NEW YORK.\nWE SHOULD KNOW PRETTY QUICKLY. >> WHAT CAN WE LEARN ABOUT THIS\nINVESTIGATION INTO THE WAY THE BOMBS WERE BUILT?\n>> QUITE A LOT, WOLF. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS\nREALLY CAUGHT THE ATTENTION OF THE INVESTIGATORS IS THE USE OF\nHMTD WHICH IS THIS EXPLOSIVE THAT WE SAW USED IN THE 2005\nLONDON BOMBINGS. THAT IS NOT EASY TO MAKE AND\nIT'S AN EXPLOSIVE THAT'S A LOT LIKE TATP WHICH WE'VE HEARD A\nLOT MORE ABOUT AND IT'S BEEN COMMONLY USED BY JIHADISTS DOING\nBOMBINGS. HMTD IS SOMETHING THAT YOU MIGHT\nHAVE LEARNED, IF YOU GOT SOME TRAINING, FOR INSTANCE, IN A\nJIHADI CAMP IN PAKISTAN. THAT REALLY IS WHAT IS CATCHING\nTHE ATTENTION OF INVESTIGATORS SIMPLY BECAUSE WE NOW KNOW THAT\nTHIS SUSPECT IS, RAHAMI, DID TRAVEL BACK TO AFGHANISTAN WHERE\nHIS FAMILY IS FROM. HE ALSO TRAVELED TO PAKISTAN, HE\nTRAVELED TO KREDA, AS PAMELA BROWN REPORTED THIS HOUR.\nALL OF THIS IS COMING TOGETHER TO REALLY BASICALLY RAISE NEW\nQUESTIONS IN THE MINDS OF INVESTIGATORS AS TO WHETHER OR\nNOT THERE WAS SOMETHING HERE, PERHAPS SOME TRAINING THAT HE\nGOT DURING THOSE TRIPS BACK TO PAKISTAN THAT THEY NEED TO NOW\nTAKE A LOOK AT. AGAIN, THAT'S THE BEGINNING OF\nTHIS INVESTIGATION. WE'RE ONLY AT THE BEGINNING OF\nTHIS AND WE'RE GOING TO LEARN A LOT MORE IN WEEKS TO COME.\n>> PETER BERGEN, YOU STUDIED TERRORISM FOR A LONG TIME.\nNOT ONLY DID HE GO TO AFGHANISTAN A NUMBER OF TIMES,\nHIS FAMILY WAS BORN THERE, BUT WE ALSO LEARNED HE SPENT MOST OF\nA YEAR IN PAKISTAN, INCLUDING A HOTBED OF THE TALIBAN.\nHE MARRIED A PAKISTANI WOMAN. WE DON'T KNOW HER WHEREABOUTS.\nHE CAME BACK TO THE UNITED STATES FOLLOWING ALL THESE\nTRIPS, HAD SECONDARY INTERVIEWS AT THE AIRPORT BUT WAS TOLD, GO\nHOME, ALL IS COOL. IS THERE A PROBLEM HERE?\n>> WELL, WE DON'T KNOW, BUT THIS IS REMINISCENT OF AN AMERICAN\nCITIZEN WHO TRIED TO BLOW UP BOMBS IN THE MANHATTAN SUBWAY IN\n2009. HE WAS ALSO FROM THE NEW YORK\nAREA. LUCKILY HE WAS APPREHENDED, BUT\nHE DID GET TRAINING FROM AL QAEDA IN PAKISTAN, SO IT'S\nCERTAINLY AN AREA YOU WOULD WANT TO INVESTIGATE RATHER THOROUGHLY\nWHEN YOU'RE TALKING TO THIS GUY. >> PHIL, A LOT OF US ARE SMARTER\nWITH HINDSIGHT, BUT APPARENTLY HE WAS ON NO ONE'S TERROR WATCH\nLIST. >> I THINK ONE OF THE QUESTIONS\nYOU HAVE TO ASK IS NOT ONLY WAS THERE A CO-CONSPIRATOR OR WAS\nSOMEONE AWARE HE WAS BEING RADICALIZED.\nIT'S NOT WHETHER OR NOT YOU WERE RESEARCHING BOMB DEVICES ON THE\nINTERNET, IT'S WHETHER SOMEONE IN THE COMMUNITY IS AFRAID TO\nCALL LAW ENFORCEMENT, BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID LAW ENFORCEMENT\nHAS TWO CHOICES, LET HIM GO OR ARREST HIM.\n>> IF HE'S ON A TERROR LIST, HE COULD BE ARRESTED WITHOUT BEING\nON THE WATCH LIST, RIGHT? >> IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT\nEVERYBODY WHO EVER WENT TO PAKISTAN OR WHOEVER GREW A BEARD\nOR COMMITTED VIOLENCE ON THEIR SPOUSE AND ALL THAT.\nTHAT'S A PROBLEM TRYING TO KEEP A DATABASE THAT'S MANAGEABLE AND\nYOU CAN DO SOMETHING WITH THAT. JUST PUTTING EVERYBODY'S NAME ON\nTHERE ISN'T NECESSARILY GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM.\n>> THE LOCATION OF THESE BOMBS IN NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY, TWO\nIN NEW YORK CITY ON 23rd STREET, 27th STREET IN CHELSEA.\nONE IN NEW JERSEY SEASIDE PARK, ANOTHER ONE IN ELIZABETH, NEW\nJERSEY. SEASIDE PARK THERE WAS A 5K RUN.\nIT WAS DELAYED. FORTUNATELY NO ONE WAS HURT.\nWHAT ARE YOU LEARNING ABOUT THE DECISION, WHERE THESE BOMBS WERE\nAPPARENTLY PLACED AT THESE VARIOUS LOCATIONS?\n>> THAT'S VERY PUZZLING, WOLF. AT THIS POINT THEY REALLY DON'T\nHAVE MUCH OF AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHY HE CHOSE THIS\nNEIGHBORHOOD. ON 23rd STREET, THERE IS AN\nENTRANCE TO THE PATH TRAIN WHICH WOULD ALLOW YOU TO BE ABLE TO\nESCAPE BACK TO NEW JERSEY, WHICH IS WHERE HE LIVED.\nSO PERHAPS THAT MIGHT BE THE EXPLANATION.\nWE DON'T KNOW WHY HE CHOSE 27th STREET WHICH IS NOT A MAJOR\nSTREET DOWN THERE IN CHELSEA. IT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF A\nNONDESCRIPT BLOCK. NOT A RITZY NEIGHBORHOOD.\nIT'S JUST BY LUCK THAT HE CHOSE THAT, PERHAPS.\nTHE EARLIER LOCATION IS POSSIBLY MORE SYMBOLIC BECAUSE OF THE\nMARINE CORPS MARATHON THAT WAS GOING ON THAT DAY.\n>> MAYBE HE WAS TRYING TO EMULATE, WE DON'T KNOW THIS,\nWHAT HAPPENED IN BOSTON AT THE BOSTON MARATHON.\nTHAT'S A COPYCAT POTENTIAL. EVERYONE STAY WITH US.\nWE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK.\nMUCH MORE ON THE BREAKING NEWS. THE BOMBINGS PUT TERRORISM FRONT\nAND CENTER IN THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.\nUP NEXT, THE VERY DIFFERENT",

CLEARLY THERE ARE THESE KINDS OF\nATTACKS, PEOPLE WILL TRY TO GENERATE THEM.\nONE THING, FOR EXAMPLE, WE KNOW THIS FELLOW TRAVELLED TO\nPAKISTAN AND AFGHANISTAN.

THE QUESTION IS, WHEN HE CAME\nBACK, DID HE DO ANYTHING THAT WOULD HAVE TRIGGERED FURTHER\nANALYSIS OR INVESTIGATION. >> WHY HAVEN'T WE HEARD ANY\nCLAIM OF RESPONSIBILITY? >> PROBABLY BECAUSE HE DID THIS\nON HIS OWN.

I MEAN, WE DON'T REALLY KNOW\nYET. THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO\nKIND OF TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND GENERATE AND DEAL WITH THE FACTS\nAS THEY COME FORWARD. >> ANY EVIDENCE THAT WHAT WAS A\nCELL, THAT HE HAD ACCOMPLICES WHO HELPED HIM TO BUILD THE\nBOMBS? >> THERE WAS TALK OF THAT FIRST.\nI HAVEN'T HEARD ANY OF THIS LATER TODAY.\nTHE FACT THAT IT WAS HIS FINGERPRINTS THAT WERE FOUND ON\nTHE OTHER BOMBS INDICATE THAT -- IT INDICATES -- THAT'S A KEY\nWORD, INDICATES. DOESN'T PROVE BUT INDICATES THAT\nHE WAS ACTING ALONE. WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING THAT\nLEADS US TO BELIEVE.

SOMEONE PICKED IT UP.\nAPPARENTLY THOUGHT PERHAPS TO STEAL IT AND MAY HAVE DISTURBED\nTHE BOMB. THAT MAY BE ONE REASON WHY IT\nDID NOT GO OFF. THESE -- THERE WERE TWO PEOPLE,\nACTUALLY, WHO SAW THE DUFFEL BAG.\nTHEY PICKED IT UP. THEY REMOVED WHAT BECAME THE\nBOMB AND LEFT IT ON THE SIDEWALK.\nAND, YOU KNOW, IT TURNS OUT THAT PERHAPS THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN\nLUCKY. THEY COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED BY\nHANDLING IT. >> THE TWO PEOPLE WHO OPENED THE\nBAG, THEY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BOMB, ITSELF?\n>> THE INVESTIGATORS ARE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO THEY\nARE, TRY TO FIND THEM. THEY WOULD LOVE TO TALK TO THEM.\nTHEY DO NOT AT THIS POINT BELIEVE THEY HAD ANYTHING TO DO\nWITH THEM. MIGHT IS BEEN HOMELESS PEOPLE,\nMIGHT HAVE BEEN SOMEONE WHO WAS SIMPLY TRYING TO STEAL A BAG.\n>> I REMEMBER AFTER THE BOSTON BOMBING, THERE WAS A LOT OF TALK\nOF COULD IN THAT CASE, YOU KNOW, THE TWO BROTHERS, OR ONE OF\nTHOSE BROTHERS, IN THE BOSTON BOMBING CASE, HAVE LEARNED HOW\nTO MAKE A DEVICE LIKE THIS JUST FROM THE INTERNET WITHOUT\nACTUALLY PRACTICING IT, WITHOUT ACTUALLY EXPLODING IT?\nI GUESS THE SAME QUESTION IS ON THIS, COULD HE HAVE JUST\nPICKED -- I KNOW ON SOME OF THESE TERROR WEBSITES AND THE\nLIKE, OR JIHADIST WEBSITES, THAT THEY HAVE INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO\nMAKE IT. WOULD YOU NEED TO ACTUALLY\nPRACTICE? >> EXACTLY.\nTHOSE ARE EXACTLY THE SAME QUESTIONS THAT AUTHORITIES ARE\nASKING AT THIS MOMENT. YES, THERE ARE RECIPES FOR THIS\nTYPE OF BOMB. WE KNOW THAT INCLUDED IN THE\nCOMPONENTS WERE ALUMINUM POWDER, AMMONIUM NITRATE, HTMD.\nTHE LAST ONE, HTMD, IS ONE WE HAVEN'T SEEN VERY MUCH.\nTHE LAST ONE WE CAN REMEMBER A PROMINENT BOMBING WAS THE 2005\nLONDON BOMBINGS. MORE COMMONLY SEE TATP USED IN\nPARIS ATTACKS AND OTHER MORE RECENT ATTACKS.\nTHE QUESTION IS WHERE DID THEY LEARN TO DO THIS?\nWAS WHERE SOME TRAINING? DID THEY PRACTICE IT?\nYOU CAN FIND THIS ON THE INTERNET BUT IT'S ALSO SOMETHING\nTHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN TRAINED, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE\nWE'RE TALKING ABOUT AT LEAST TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF BOMBS.\nSO WHOEVER -- HOWEVER LONG HE'S BEEN TRYING TO MAKE THESE, HE\nDID HAVE SOME KIND OF EXPERTISE. >> BUT IMMEDIATELY RIGHT NOW,\nTHEY BELIEVE HE WAS ACTING ALONE BUT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR ANY\nKIND OF WIDER NETWORK. >> ABSOLUTELY.\nTHEY DON'T BELIEVE RIGHT NOW THERE'S ANOTHER BOMB MAKER OUT\nTHERE, BUT THEY DO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S SOMEBODY WHO MIGHT HAVE\nPROVIDED SOME HELP, PERHAPS SOME TRAINING AND THAT'S WHERE THE\nFOCUS IS RIGHT NOW. >> EVAN PEREZ.\nTHANK YOU.

THE FBI LABORATORY HAS\nINVESTIGATIONS OF BOMBINGS AROUND THE WORLD FOR THE LAST\nDECADE SO THEY KNOW EVERY LITTLE THING ABOUT HOW A BOMB IS PUT\nTOGETHER. WHETHER IT'S A LONE WOLF TYPE\nPERSON OR THE SIGNATURE OF A BOMB MAKER.\nTHEY KNOW WHERE ALL THESE EXPLOSIVES COME FROM, WHERE THEY\nARE SOLD, WHAT THE WIRES ARE, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.\nI COULD GO ON AND ON AND ON. WITH UNEXPLODED DEVICES, THEY'RE\nGOING TO GET DNA FOUND. >> THIS IS KAYLA.\nONE OF THE KEY QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THIS\nMORNING IS WHETHER THIS SUSPECT POTENTIALLY WAS ACTING ALONE OR\nWHETHER THIS IS PART OF A SMALL TERROR CELL.\nON ONE HAND, WE HAD A FORMER FBI OFFICIAL SAYING THE DIVERSITY OF\nTHE DEVICES WOULD LEAD YOU TO BELIEVE THERE WERE MORE THAN ONE\nPRN. HE WASN'T GETTING ANY HELP WITH\nHIS GET-AWAY PLAN. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?\n>> I THINK IT'S MUCH TOO EARLY TO SPECULATE ON ALL OF THAT\nSTUFF, QUITE FRANKLY. THE EARLY SPECULATION IS USHLGLY\nWRONG. YOU CAN TELL A LOT FROM DEVICES\nAND THE SOPHISTICATION OF THEM, BUT, YOU KNOW, I THINK THE NEW\nNORMAL, UNFORTUNATELY, IS GOING TO BE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE\nTERRIBLY SOPHISTICATED. THEY'RE GOING TO BE DROP AND RUN\nTYPE DEVICES. I HOPE I'M WRONG, BUT THE\nREALITY IS WE DON'T HAVE A CLUE WHO COMES AND GOES INTO THE\nUNITED STATES. THE FBI, I HAVE BEEN TALKING\nABOUT THIS FOR A LONG, LONG TIME.\nTHEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM WE'RE\nFACING TODAY. THE CONGRESS AND THE WHITE HOUSE\nREFUSES TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.\nTHE BORDER IS WIDE OPEN. YOU CAN DRIVE MACK TRUCKS OVER\nIT ALL DAY. >> I THINK WE HAVE TOUCHED ON\nTHAT IN THE PAST. UNFORTUNATELY, SURROUNDING\nEVENTS LIKE THIS. JAMES, THE PRESIDENT JUST SAID\nHE DOES NOT BELIEVE THERE'S A CONNECTION BETWEEN WHAT HAPPENED\nHERE IN THE NORTHEAST AND WHAT HAPPENED IN IF ST. CLOUD.\nI WONDER WHETHER YOU BELIEVE THERE'S ANY URGENCY FOR THOSE\nTHAT WANT TO DO HARM? >> YEAH.\nI MEAN, IT VERY WELL COULD. A LOT OF THESE GUYS ARE BEING\nINFLUENCED BY WHAT THEY SEE ON THE INTERNET.\nFROM THAT STANDPOINT, THERE MIGHT BE UNIFORMITY TO THIS.\nYEAH, IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THAT MAD MAN OUT THERE IN THE MALL\nTHAT GUY COULD BE INFLUENCED BY THE SAME THING OF THIS GUY.\n>> FORMER FBI ASSISTANT DIRECTOR.\nAPPRECIATE YOUR TIME SO MUCH.

CLINTON N THE MEANWHILE, WANTED\nTO WAIT FOR MORE INFORMATION BEFORE DRAWING CONCLUSIONS.\nGIVEN THE NEW INFORMATION THAT WE'VE GOTTEN OVER THE WEEKEND,\nWE'LL SEE HOW MUCH FURTHER SHE GOES THAN THE STATEMENT THAT SHE\nRELEASED YESTERDAY WHERE SHE DID ACTUALLY CALL THE INCIDENTS\nAPPARENT TERRORIST ATTACKS. NO DOUBT ABOUT IT, SHE'LL BE\nTRYING TO DRAW A CONTRAST BETWEEN HERSELF AND DONALD TRUMP\nON THE ISSUE OF TERRORISM AND FOREIGN POLICY.\nCAROL? >> MJ LEE, WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU\nWHEN HILLARY CLINTON BEGINS SPEAKING.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH. MR. TRUMP ON HIS PART SPOKE\nABOUT IT OVER THE WEEKEND, AS DID HILLARY CLINTON, BUT MR.\nTRUMP APPEARED ON \"FOX & FRIENDS\" THIS MORNING AND DID\nCOMMENT ON THE BOMBINGS OVER THE WEEKEND.\nHE SLAMMED PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HILLARY CLINTON'S TERROR EFFORTS\nOVERSEAS IN PART FOR THE BOMBINGS HERE IN NEW YORK CITY\nAND IN NEW JERSEY. AND HE SUGGESTED THAT LOCAL\nPOLICE GET TOUGH AND DISPENSE WHAT IS BEING POLITICALLY\nCORRECT. LET'S LISTEN.\n>> THE LOCAL POLICE, THEY KNOW WHO A LOT OF THE PEOPLE ARE.\nTHEY ARE AFRAID TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT\nTO BE ACCUSED OF PROFILING. AND THEY DON'T WANT TO BE\nACCUSED OF ALL SORTS OF THINGS. IN ISRAEL, THEY PROFILE, THEY\nHAVE DONE AN UNBELIEVABLE JOB, BUT ISRAEL HAS DONE AN\nUNBELIEVABLE JOB AND THEY PROFILE.\nTHEY SEE SOMEBODY SUSPICIOUS, THEY WILL PROFILE AND WILL TAKE\nTHAT PERSON IN AND CHECK OUT. DO WE HAVE A CHOICE?\nLOOK WHAT IS GOING ON, DO WE REALLY HAVE A CHOICE?\nWE ARE TRYING TO BE SO POLITICALLY CORRECT IN OUR\nCOUNTRY, AND THIS IS ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE.\n>> ALL RIGHT. SO THAT'S WHAT HE SAID ON \"FOX &\nFRIENDS\" THIS MORNING. HERE TO DISCUSS, NIA MALIK\nHENDERSON AND DAVID CANTANESE. WELCOME TO YOU BOTH.\nDAVID, WHAT WAS MR. TRUMP SUGGESTING THROUGH?\n>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW. I THINK THAT NEEDS MORE PROBING.\nHE'S BASICALLY -- I KNOW HE HAS SUGGESTED DOING THIS IN THE\nPAST, BUT IF HE'S OUTLINING A POSITION OF PROFILING, I THINK\nMORE QUESTIONS HAVE TO BE ASKED OF HIM.\nHOW EXACTLY WOULD HE PROFILE? WHAT STANDARDS WOULD HE USE?\nAND I THINK IN THE LIGHT OF THE INCIDENTS OVER THE WEEKEND, HE\nIS CERTAINLY GOING TO BE ASKED EXACTLY WHAT HE MEANS BY THOSE\nCOMMENTS. AND I CAN'T IMAGINE SECRETARY\nCLINTON AGREEING WITH THAT. >> YEAH, AND NIA MA LIKA, I SAY\nTHAT BECAUSE JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO THEY HAD TO WORK OUT A DEAL\nWITH THIS PROBLEM OF RACIAL PROFILING.\n>> HE'S SAYING THE POLICE AREN'T DOING THEIR JOB BECAUSE THEY ARE\nADP ADPRKS -- AFRAID OF THE\nCONSEQUENCES. I DON'T SUSPECT HE HAS MUCH\nEVIDENCE TO SUGGEST TO LOCAL POLICE THAT THEY AREN'T DOING\nTHEIR JOBS TO THE FULLEST THEY CAN WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF THE\nLAW. SO YEAH, HERE WE GO TALKING\nABOUT TERRORISM AGAIN. I THINK THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM\nIS THAT TERRORISM, WHEN AN INCIDENT LIKE THIS HAPPENS, THAT\nIT BENEFITS DONALD TRUMP. I DON'T THINK THERE'S MUCH\nEVIDENCE THAT THAT IS ACTUALLY TRUE.\nHE DOES LEAD ON TERRORISM IN TERMS OF ASKING PEOPLE WHO WILL\nBE TOUGHER ON HIM. TERRORISM AND ISIS, I THINK\nHILLARY CLINTON HANDLES THE FOREIGN POLICY MORE BROADLY.\nWE'LL SEE WHAT HILLARY CLINTON SAYS TODAY IN THE PRESS\nCONFERENCE. >> BUT AGAIN, DAVID, IT'S THE\nBIG BOLD STATEMENT. HE COMES OUT AND SAYS SOMETHING.\nAND HILLARY CLINTON WILL BE MUCH MORE NUANCED IN HER COMMENTS.\nDOESN'T THAT RESONATE WHEN THINGS LIKE THIS HAPPEN IN OUR\nCOUNTRY? >> WELL, IT USUALLY DOES BECAUSE\nPEOPLE GET SCARED AND SEE THE HEADLINE COMES OUT, THIS IS\nABSOLUTELY FRIGHTENING THIS CAN HAPPEN ON A SIDEWALK OR STREET\nCORNER AT ANY GIVEN, POINT IN TIME.\nLOOK AT THE ROLLING INFORMATION WE GOT OVER THE WEEKEND.\nTHE OTHER PROBLEM WITH THESE EVENTS IS WE HAVE NEVER HAD AS\nMUCH INFORMATION AS WE REQUIRE POLITICIANS TO HAVE WHEN THEY\nMAKE THESE STATEMENTS. I MEAN, ORIGINALLY THEY DIDN'T\nHAVE ANY CONNECTION. YOU HAD POLITICIANS COMING OUT\nTO SAY THERE WAS NO CONNECTION TO THE EVENTS IN NEW JERSEY AND\nNEW YORK. THEN IT WAS UNCLEAR.\nYOU'RE STILL GETTING MIXED SIGNALS ABOUT THIS FROM THE\nSTATE OF NEW YORK AND MAYOR DE BLASIO ABOUT WHETHER THIS WAS\nTERRORISM, WHETHER IT WAS INTENTIONAL.\nIT CHANGED THROUGHOUT THE WEEKEND.\nEVEN OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS THE INFORMATION ON THIS.\nTHEN WE REQUIRE A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE TO COME OUT WITH\nSTATEMENTS ON WHAT THEY WOULD DO.\nAND FRANKLY, THEY'RE NOT GETTING THIS INFORMATION MUCH QUICKER\nTHAN WE ARE. AND TRUMP IS IMPULSIVE.\nHE'S GOING TO BE THE TOUGH GUY TO SLAM DOWN HARD ON THE\nPERPETRATORS, ON THE TERRORISTS. HILLARY CLINTON, THIS IS -- SHE\nIS INHERENTLY MORE CAUTIOUS AND I THINK WLL SEE THAT AGAIN\nTODAY. I THINK SHE WANTS THAT CONTRAST\nWITH DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE SHE THINKS, EVEN IF IT DOESN'T\nBENEFIT HER IN THE SHORT-TERM WHERE PEOPLE WANT A MORE\nEMPHATIC REACTION, THEY TRUST HER MORE IN THE LONG-TERM.\nI THINK THAT IS HER BET. >> WE'LL JUST HAVE TO WAIT AND\nSEE WHAT SHE SAYS, THOSE COMMENTS COMING FROM HILLARY\nCLINTON AT ANY MOMENT. NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON AND DAVID\nCANTANESE, THANK YOU. THE NEXT HOUR OF \"CNN NEWSROOM\"\nBEGINS RIGHT NOW. I'M CAROL COSTELLO.\nOFFICIALS ARE NOW SAYING IT IS POSSIBLE AN ACTIVE TERROR CELL\nCOULD BE OPERATING IN THE NEW YORK/NEW JERSEY AREA AFTER A\nSPRING OF WEEKEND BOMBINGS.

TO ME, THAT'S AN ESSENCE OF\nTERRORISM. >> GET OFF THE STREET!\n>> Reporter: ONE BOMBING, TWO VERY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES AND\nBEHIND THE SCENES, QUESTIONS OF WHY.\nIT WAS AN APPROACH AT LEAST ON ITS FACE DESIGNED TO RATCHET\nBACK THE KINDS OF CONCERNS THAT WOULD LEAD TO PANIC AND ALSO\nURGE CAUTION ABOUT JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS, THE MAYOR SAID.\nHE WAS BACKED BY THE CITY'S NEW POLICE COMMISSIONER.\n>> IF IT'S ACT OF TERRORISM, WE'RE GOING TO COME OUT AND SAY\nIT. >> Reporter: SOURCES TELL CNN IT\nWAS A PERSONAL ONE FOR de BLASIO WHEN TIED TO THE LEGAL\nDEFINITION OF THE WORD AND ONE THE MAYOR WOULD NOT LET GO OF.\nHE STUCK BY THE POSITION EVEN AMID AN INTERNAL DEBATE WITH LAW\nENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS OVER THE RELUCTANCE TO SAY THE EVENTS\nWERE BEING INVESTIGATED AS A POSSIBLE ACT OF TERROR.\nIT WAS A RELUCTANCE, LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS NOTED, NOT\nSHOWN BY OFFICIALS IN AN UNRELATED ATTACK THIS WEEKEND.\nTHE DEBATE RENDERED MOOT, AN ARREST AND DEFINITIVE ANSWER\nTHAT IT WAS, INDEED, AN ACT OF TERROR.\nAS TO THE PERCEIVED SPLIT LEADING UP TO THAT POINT --\n>> FRANKLY, IT'S SEMANTICS. THE MAYOR AND I VIEWED THE SITE\nTOGETHER. WE HAVE THE SAME INFORMATION.\nTHE SAME OBSERVATION AND THE SAME CONCLUSIONS.\n>> THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE TRYING TO BRUSH OVER IT AND MAKE\nIT NICE. I MEAN --\n>> A LITTLE BIT. >> NOT SEMANTICS.\n>> NO, NOT AT ALL. THE ISSUE HERE, WHEN YOU LOOK AT\nIT, THIS WAS A SPLIT, ABSOLUTELY A SPLIT AND IT WAS A VERY PUBLIC\nSPLIT. IT WAS ONE THAT WAS BASED ON AS\nI STATED IN THE PIECE, THE MAYOR BEHIND THE SCENES.\nTHERE ARE LEGAL CONNOTATIONS THAT COME WITH THE WORD, TERROR.\nTHEY DID NOT WANT TO TRIGGER THAT, de BLASIO'S TEAM UNTIL\nTHEY HAD THEIR HANDS AROUND THE INVESTIGATION.\nTHIS ALL HAPPENED VERY, VERY FAST OVER THE COURSE OF 24\nHOURS. THEY WEREN'T TOTALLY SURE OF THE\nMOTI MOTIVATIONS.\nTHAT'S WHY THEY HELD OFF. THE REALITY IS WHEN YOU TALK TO\nLAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS, OTHER PUBLIC OFFICIALS, THERE'S A WAY\nTO HEDGE THIS ANSWER AND MENTION TERRORISM WITHOUT KIND OF\nTRIGGERING EVERYTHING. THAT WOULD MAKE THIS NOT AN\nISSUE ANYMORE. IT BECAME AN ISSUE.\nBECAME AN ISSUE THAT GOT A LOT OF ATTENTION.\nAT LEAST FOR A LITTLE BIT. THE CONCERN WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT\nOFFICIALS IS THIS WOULD BECOME THE ISSUE, NOT THE\nINVESTIGATION. AT LEAST FOR A PERIOD, IT WAS.\n>> OF COURSE, THE PUBLIC, NO QUESTION ABOUT WHAT AN ACT OF\nTERROR IS. PRETTY CLEAR.\nAND THIS FIT THAT DEFINITION.",

AT THE MARGIN YOU CAN MOVE S&P\nFUTURES WITH AN ALGARHYTHM THAT'S PROGRAMMED TO PICK UP ON\nSPEECHES BEING GIVEN, CERTAIN CUES BEING GIVEN BY DIFFERENT\nFED OFFICIALS. THE JURY IS STILL OUT AS TO\nWHETHER OR NOT THAT ACTUALLY WORKS AS A TRADING STRATEGY, BUT\nIN TODAY'S DAY AND AGE THERE'S A LOT OF IT OUT THERE.\n>> THIS IS MAN VERSUS MACHINE. THAT'S THE CONVERSATION.\n>> MACHINE VERSUS MACHINE. >> MACHINE VERSUS MACHINE WITH\nMAN JUST STANDING IN THE CORNER LIKE, HELP.\n>> WELL, MAN REPORTING ON IT, I GUESS.\n>> IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK THIS IS?\n>> I THINK JOSH IS VERY ACCURATE AND HIS ANALYSIS OF WHAT WENT ON\nAND HOW ALGAS WILL WORK. THEY'RE INTENSIFY THEIR\nATTENTION. THEY KNOW THE LIQUIDITY IS RIGHT\nNOW REALLY NOT VERY MANY PEOPLE ARE SITTING AT THEIR DESK\nWILLING TO PICK UP THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT.\nYOU HAVE AN ALGO THAT'S GOING TO PICK UP ON COMMENTS THAT ARE\nSAYING HAWKISHNESS, THEY'RE SAYING VALUATION RICH, THEN\nCLEARLY YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THE TYPE OF S&P FUTURE ACTION THAT\nYOU HAVE SEEN. >> KEVIN, LET'S JUST SAY THAT\nRICHARD FISHER DID MOVE THE MARKET BY SUGGESTING THAT THE\nLANGUAGE IS GOING TO BECOME MORE HAWKISH WITH THIS MEETING FROM\nJANET YELLIN HERSELF, AND THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE A MOVE IN\nRATES. YOU HAVE MADE THE ARGUMENT THAT\nTHE MARKET IS READY FOR A HIKE. WOULDN'T THAT SUGGEST OTHERWISE?\n>>. >> I GO BACK IN HISTORY AND LOOK\nAT FED HIKES THAT ARE FAR MORE DRAMATIC THAN THIS.\nIT WOULD BE AN EXTREME RANDOM OUTCOME IF THEY WENT MORE THAN\n25 BASIS POINTS. THE REASON YOU'RE MOVING RATES\nIS ENHANCED ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, WHICH MANIFESTS ITSELF TO\nENHANCED EARNINGS JUST A YEAR FROM NOW OR MAYBE 18 MONTHS.\nIT QUICKLY RESUMES ITS CLIMB HIGHER.\nI DON'T THINK A FED HIKE IS GOING TO BE A PROBLEM.\nTHE QUESTION IS WHY ARE THEY DOING IT?\nARE THEY DOING IT JUST TO SHOW THEY'RE STILL IN CONTROL AND\nTHEN ONE AND DONE? THAT'S NOT EXCITING.\n25, EVEN 50 BIPS DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING FOR FINANCIALS.\nFINANCIALS ARE STILL THE BEST WAY TO TRADE FED HIKES TO THE\nBULL OR BEAR SIDE. CAN YOU SEE NOBODY KNOWS WHAT'S\nGOING TO HAPPEN HERE. EVERYBODY ASSUMES IT'S THE WORST\nIS OVER, BUT THE -- THE RETURN ON ASSETS FOR THESE BANKS ARE\nTHE WORST I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY INVESTING LIFETIME.\nTHEY ARE JUST BRUTALLY BAD. NOW ON TOP OF THAT, ALL THE\nREGULATORS HATE THEM. EVEN THE PEOPLE HATE THEM.\nTHEY'VE BEEN VILIFIED. I'M NOT EXCITED ABOUT THIS\nSECTOR, AND I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU CAN OUTPERFORM\nTHE MARKET BY BEING UNDERWEIGHT FINANCIALS, EVEN DURING A RATE\nHIKE BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THE EARNINGS ARE INCREASINGLY GOING\nUP WITH 25, EVEN 50 BIPS. THEY USED TO BE SO BIG IN THE\nS&P. NOW THEY'RE, LIKE, IN THE\nD-LEAGUE. I FEEL SORRY FOR THOSE GUYS.\n>> I HAVE NOBODY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT.\n>> I'M ON THE OTHER SIDE. I THINK USING THE TERMS BANKS\nAND FINANCIALS INTERCHANGEABLY PRESENTS A LITTLE BIT OF A\nMISLEADING PICTURE ON WHAT'S GOING ON.\nTHERE ARE NONBANK FINANCIALS THAT ARE SHOOTING THE LIGHTS OUT\nIN TERMS OF EARNINGS AND STOCK PERFORMANCE.\nTAKE A LOOK AT A CHART OF MASTER CARD.\nSTOCK JUST BROKE $1 00 THIS MORNING FOR THE THIRD TIME.\nHOPEFULLY THIRD TIME IS THE CHARM OF 2016.\nTHIS IS NOT A STOCK THAT'S DEPENDENT ON RATE HIKES.\nRATE HIKES WOULD NOT HURT. TAKE A LOOK AT CME GROUP.\nTHIS IS A FINANCIAL. IT'S NOT A BANK.\nKILLING IT RIGHT NOW. ALL OF THE VOLATILITY AROUND\nINTEREST RATES, AROUND CURRENCIES, BENEFITTING CME'S.\nI THINK KEVIN WOULD AGREE. LET'S SEPARATE BANKS THAT ARE\nDESPERATE FOR SOME NET INTEREST MARGIN TO COME BACK VERSUS OTHER\nFINANCIALS THAT ARE EARNING A HEALTHY RETURN ON ASSETS,\nRETURNING DIVIDENDS. THERE ARE TWO THINGS GOING ON\nHERE IN THE SAME SECTOR. >> I AGREE.\n>> YEAH. OKAY.\nI'M SORRY. KEVIN, FINISH YOUR THOUGHT.\n>> I AGREE. YOU REMEMBER, MOST PEOPLE OWN\nTHE FINANCIALS THROUGH SOME KIND OF INDEX OR ETF.\nMOST OF THE MARKET CAP IS STILL A MONEY SET OR BANKS.\nIF YOU'RE A STOCK PICKER, IF YOU CAN BE A STOCK PICKER AND GET\nTHE FINANCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE STROKS LIKE CREDIT CARDS, SAYS\nYOU WILL SHINE IF YOU GET IT RIGHT.\nAS A SECTOR, IT'S JUST GOING NOWHERE.\n>> YEAH. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT, YOU KNOW,\nAPPLE LOSING 1% OR SO, AND WE'RE GOING TO GET TO MORE OF THAT.\nI KNOW I DO WANT AND I KNOW PEOPLE DO WANT YOUR THOUGHTS\nTHERE. LET'S TALK ABOUT SHARES OF A\nSTOCK THAT IS JUST EXPLODING TODAY.\nSAREPTA AFTER THE COMPANY APPROVED -- STEVE WEISS OWNS THE\nSTOCK. HE JONES US NOW ON THE PHONE.\nARE YOU THERE? >> I'M HERE.\nI'M HERE. >> UNBELIEVABLE MOVE, STEVE.\n90%. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU ARE OUT\nTHROWING A PARTY FOR YOURSELF THIS MORNING AS A RESULT OF THIS\nMOVE, BUT WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE STOCK TODAY?\nMORE IMPORTANTLY. >> WELL, I A LOT OF NAY SAYERS.\nWE HAD THREE FIRM THAT IS WERE OUT THERE.\nJEFFREYS JUST LAST WEEK CAME OUT AND SAID, HEY, AFTER FARCUS\nRESIGNED FROM THE BOARD AND WAS THE MAIN ADVERSARY, HE SAID\nDON'T GET TOO EXCITED. THIS IS TYPICAL OF BIOTECH\nSTOCKS WHERE IT'S VERY, VERY DANGEROUS FOR SOMEBODY.\nIN FACT, SOMEBODY LIKE ME WHO IS NOT A SCIENTIST, WHO IS NOT\nPLUGGED IN. IF YOU RECALL, WE HAD JOE\nADELMAN COME ON THE SHOW. HE WRITES PERCEPTIVE ADVISORS.\nWE ARE INVESTED, IN FULL DISCLOSURE, IN HIS HEDGE FUND,\nAND HE IS PURE AND SIMPLY THE BEST OUT THERE AND DOES THE BEST\nWORK ON IT. THE DRUG HAD BEEN DECLINED IN\nTERMS OF APPROVAL BE THE ADVISORY BOARD, AND JANET\nWOODCOCK HAD GIVEN SIGNALS THAT, YES, IT WOULD BE APPROVED, AND\nTHIS IS A DRUG THAT GOES RIGHT TO PEDIATRIC MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY\nPATIENTS WHICH IS A VERY SMALL SUBSET OF MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY\nPATIENTS, BUT IS SORELY NEEDED. THE BIG DRUG COMPANIES DON'T GO\nAFTER BECAUSE THERE AREN'T ENOUGH PATIENTS OR REVENUES.\nSHE DID THE RIGHT THING. IT'S VERY, VERY ENCOURAGING TO\nSEE THAT REGULATORS CAN BE SORT OF BEATEN BY OTHER REGULATORS,\nAND YOU CAN DO THE RIGHT THING. THE STOCKS ARE WORKING OUT.\nIT'S VERY EXCITING. I THINK IT WORKS FROM HERE\nSTILL. THEY'LL GET THE MARKET AS SOON\nAS THEY CAN. THERE ARE SOME STRINGS ATTACHED.\nTHEY HAVE TO DO A BROADER STUDY AND GET IT TO THE FDA IN TWO\nYEARS. THEY SHOULD GET IT THROUGH.\n>> I KNOW YOU ARE GOING TO -- I KNOW YOU ARE GOING TO SAY I JUST\nANSWERED YOUR QUESTION WHEN I ASKED YOU THE NEXT ONE, BUT FROM\nA TRADE SCHOOL STANDPOINT, IF NOTHING ELSE, STOCK POPS NEARLY\n100%, AND YET, YOU ONLY SELL HALF.\nI AM JUST CURIOUS HOW YOU GET THAT THOUGHT INTO YOUR LADY NOT\nTO JUST SELL THE WHOLE THING AND BE HAPPY WITH WHAT YOU HAVE MADE\nSO FAR. >> WELL, YOU KNOW, I MAY BE OUT\nOF IT. I WANT TO DIGEST IT A LITTLE\nBIT, AND I MAY BE OUT BY THE END OF THE DAY.\nI MAY BE OUT BY TOMORROW. I LIKE THE WAY IT'S TRADING\nHERE. I WAS HEDGED OUT, COMPLETELY\nHEDGED OUT ON THE STOCK.

WE'RE READY TO LAUNCH.\nWE HAVE SALES FORCE. WE HAVE DISTRIBUTION CENTERS\nREADY TO GO. WE HAVE REIMBURSEMENT PEOPLE\nTHAT ARE ACTIVE AND IN CAMBRIDGE AND READY TO WORK.\nSO THAT WILL BE THE FIRST FOCUS AND MAKING SURE EVERYBODY WHO\nWANTS THE DRUG CAN GET IT. THE NEXT THING WE'RE DOING IS\nMAKING SURE THAT WE'RE WORKING ON OUR OTHER PRODUCTS THAT CAN\nADDRESS MANY MORE BOYS WITH MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY AND IN THE\nPIPELINE AND WE'RE TRYING TO GET THOSE OUT AND WE HAVE A NEXT\nGENERATION THERAPY THAT WE ARE WORKING ON.\nSO WE HAVE A LOT OF PROGRAMS, WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT IT.\nWE'VE BEEN WAITING A VERY LONG TIME TO GET THIS DONE.\nAND WE BELIEVE THAT THE PATIENTS ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING\nACCESS TO THE THERAPY. >> I'VE HEARD FROM SOME OF THE\nPATIENTS TODAY AND THEY ARE SAYING THEY COULD BREATHE AGAIN.\nIT IS AMAZING HEARING FROM THE PATIENT COMMUNITY.\nAT THE SAME TIME THIS WAS A SURPRISE TO THE INVESTOR\nCOMMUNITY AND THE BIOTECH ANALYST COMMUNITY.\nTHE NOTES COMING OUT, RBC CALLING THIS ONE OF THE MOST\nPERPLEXING AND CALLING IT EXTREMELY UNPRECEDENTED, WHAT DO\nYOU SAY TO THE PEOPLE THAT THIS WAS A BAD DECISION BY THE FDA\nAND THERE WASN'T ENOUGH DATA AND THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE APPROVED\nTHIS. >> WELL, I THINK WE'RE IN A NEW\nERA OF REALLY INTERESTING SCIENCE, PERSONALIZED GENETIC\nMEDICINE.

AND REMEMBER, THERE IS A LOT OF\nLEGISLATION THAT HAS CHANGED FOR ORPHAN DISEASES.\nAND MAKING SURE THAT YOU COULD INCLUDE ALL OF THE DATA.\nREMEMBER THESE ARE VERY SMALL POPULATIONS.\nTHEY ARE COMPLICATES SCIENCE AND PERSONALIZED GENETIC MEDICINE\nAND SO I THINK THE FDA USED THE FLEXIBILITY THAT IS IN THE LAW\nTO TRY TO GET THIS APPROVED. SO I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO SEE\nIN THE FUTURE IS MANY OTHER COMPANIES LIKE SAREPTA THAT ARE\nTRYING TO PUSH THE ENVELOPE SCIENTIFICALLY AND TO TRY TO USE\nTHE LAW AS IT WAS DESIGNED -- AND REALLY THE PURPOSE IS TO GET\nTHERAPY TO PATIENTS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.\nAND SO I THINK THE FDA FOLLOWED THE MANDATE THAT THEY WERE GIVEN\nAND THEY WORKED VERY HARD -- AND I COMMEND THEM ON GETTING THIS\nDONE. >> AND DR. KAYE, LAST WEEK ONE\nOF YOUR BIGGEST CRITICS ON THE FDA RESIGNED.\nDID THAT PROVIDE THE CLEAR PATH FOR THIS DRUG -- IS IT A\nCOINCIDENCE THIS GUY RESIGNS LAST WEEK AND THE DRUG IS\nAPPROVED THIS WEEK? >> YOU KNOW, WE DON'T HAVE\nREALLY ANY INSIGHT INTO THAT WHOLE PROCESS.\nAND I THINK DR.

THE ONLY PAN LIFT I CAUGHT UP\nWHO WAS REALLY POUNDING THE CHEST OUTRIGHT BULLISH ON THE\nMARKET, AND HIS IDEA? BUY AMAZON.\nI THINK IT'S WORTH GOING OVER SUGGESTIONS BECAUSE FRANKLY THEY\nREALLY MAKE SENSE TO ME AS A PLACE TO GO AFTER THE FED\nMEETING. MILLER, A FAMOUS STOCK PICKER,\nSTARTED BY SAYING HE LIKED FACEBOOK, GOOGLE, AND AMAZON.\nI THINK HE PICKED ALL THREE FOR TWO REASONS.\nONE BEING THAT HE WANTED TO MAKE CLEAR HIS GROWTH BONA FIDES.\nBUT, TWO, HE ALSO KNEW THEY WERE PROBABLY ALL REVILED BY THE\nAUDIENCE BECAUSE THEY'RE OBVIOUS AND BELOVED BY RETAIL INVESTORS.\nHENCE WHY THEY'RE DESPISED BY THE HEDGE FUND INTELLIGENTSIA IN\nTHE ROOM. I'M ONLY BEING HALF FA SEESHOUS\nOR SARCASTIC OR SARDONIC. YOU TAKE YOUR PICK.\nWHY DOES MILLER LIKE ONE OBVIOUS NAME, AMAZON OVER THE OTHER TWO?\nBECAUSE THE LATTER TWO ARE BOTH GOING AFTER THE SAME\n$500 BILLION ADVERTISING MARKET, AND EVEN THOUGH THAT'S A HUGE\nPIE THEY'RE SPLITTING, HE POINTED OUT THAT AMAZON HAS ITS\nSIGHTS SET MUCH HIGHER. THE $5 TRILLION RETAIL MARKET.\nSO, THEREFORE, IT'S INHERENTLY BETTER STORY.\nBIGGER TAM, TOTAL ADDRESSABLE MARKET.\nAT ONE POINT THERE WAS A TIME WHEN AMAZON WAS PRIMARILY A BOOK\nSELLER. IS THERE ANY DOUBT NOW THAT ALL\nRETAIL IS VULNERABLE TO AMAZON? I MEAN ALL OF IT.\nI MEAN WHAT IS IT THAT THEY CAN'T SELL AND MAYBE SELL BETTER\nTHAN ANY OF THE BRICKS AND MORTAR PLACES?\nTHERE'S A HANDFUL OF THINGS, YOU ABOUT THEY MAY NOT EVEN MATTER.\nIT'S NOT JUST THE SIZE OF THE COMPANY THE MARKET WANTS TO\nDOMINATE. IT'S HOW FAST AMAZON PLANS ON\nDOING. MILLER SAID, WE'VE NEVER SEEN\nA -- THAT IS PEOPLE. THAT IS STUNNING.\nTHEN THERE'S THE WEB SERVICES DIVISION WHICH POWERS THE\nFULFILLMENT BUSINESS. 30% MARGINS AND THEY'RE GROWING.\nMILLER MADE A COMMENT I SHOULD HAVE ASKED HIM ABOUT WHICH WAS\nHIS ASSERTION THAT AMAZON HAS A THREE-YEAR LEAD.\nI WHICH I HAD ASKED HIM OVER WHO.\nLAST WEEK ORACLE SAID IT OFFERS A SUPERIOR CLOUD MARKET.\nAND WALMART HAS ACQUIRED BARGAIN BASEMENT JET.COM.\nTHAT DEAL CLOSES ON WEDNESDAY, THIS WEEK.\nIN AN EFFORT TO CATCH UP. >> AND I LIKE THAT DEAL.\nI THINK THAT NOLAN HAS A LOT OF GOOD THINGS TO SAY.\nHOW ABOUT AMAZON'S BLEEDING FOR RAY INTO THE REST OF THE WORLD.\nBILL MILLER POINTS OUT THAT THE MARGINS ARE AT ZERO FOR ITS\nINTERNATIONAL BUSINESS. HOWEVER, HE THINKS THEY'RE\nHEADED TO 7%. THAT WILL BE GIGANTIC FOR\nAMAZON. IF THINGS DON'T DEGRADE, IF THEY\nKEEP AT THESE LEVELS, MILLER SAID THE STOCK COULD -- I ALMOST\nHESITATED TO SAY IT -- DOUBLE. DOUBLE IN THREE YEARS.\nTHAT'S RIGHT. 775 GOES TO 1550.\nTHREE YEARS. THIS IS A SERIOUS FUND MANAGER.\nI BET THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN THAT ROOM JUST LIKE SO MANY\nOTHER BIG TIME MONEY MANAGERS JUST DISMISSED THIS IDEA AS\nCOCKAMAMY. WHAT DOES AMAZON HAS TO DO WITH\nWHEN JANET YELLEN PUTS THAT QUARTER POINT RATE HIKE THROUGH?\nWHEN THESE MANAGERS SPEAK OF THE EQUITY MARKETS BEING SUBJECT TO\nA SENT TRAL BANK CRUSHING, ISN'T AMAZON THE KIND OF EQUITY\nTHEY'RE TALKING ABOUT? HERE'S THE WHOLE POINT OF THE\nEXERCISE I'M BRINGING TO YOU TODAY.\nTHE REASON YOU WANT TO BUY AMAZON IS PRECISELY BECAUSE IT\nHAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FED, NOTHING.\nAMAZON IS SOMETHING THAT MANY PEOPLE LOVE, AND THEY CAN'T SEEM\nTO LIVE WITHOUT, PARTICULARLY PRIME.\nHOWEVER IF THESE FUND MANAGERS IN THAT BIG ROOM, ALL THAT GOOD\nWORK BY JEFF BEZOS MEANS NOTHING BECAUSE ALL THEY CAN SEE IS A\nSERIES OF RATE HIKES THAT WILL CRATER EVERYTHING IN ITS PATH.\nSO THEY DON'T TRY TO DISTINGUISH AMONG COMPANIES.\nME, I DISTINGUISH. I THINK BILL MILLER HAS GOT IT\nRIGHT. AMAZON'S WHAT WINS, NOT LOSES ON\nA RATE HIKE BECAUSE OF ITS LACK OF EXPOSURE TO THE FED.\nIT'S NOT A BOND MARKET EQUIVALENT.\nYOU WON'T MEET A RETAILER WHO DOESN'T STAY UP AT NIGHT\nWORRYING ABOUT AMAZON REGARDLESS OF FED, AND THAT WANT CHANGE\nAFTER WEDNESDAY. I HAVE A WHOLE HOST OF EXAMPLES\nOF HOW MUCH MONEY COULD HAVE BEEN MADE IF YOU WEREN'T SO\nWORRIED ABOUT WEDNESDAY'S MEETING.\nTHERE'S TECH DATA AT A TIME WHEN COMPONENTS ARE EXPERIENCING AN\nUPDATE, TODAY TECH DATA SPENT $2.6 BILLION IN -- ONE WHOLE\nPRODUCT LINE THAT IT HAS. HOW DID TECH DATA DO?\nIT'S UP 22% ON THE NEWS. I LIKE THAT.\nTHEN THERE'S SAREPTA THERAPIES. FDA FOR APPROVAL OF A DRUG.\nOR INFO BLOCKS WHICH RALLIED 15%.\nHOWEVER, THESE ARE RELATIVELY UNKNOWN OR SMALL COMPANIES, SO I\nCAN UNDERSTAND YOU DON'T WANT TO MESS WITH THOSE AHEAD OF THE\nFED. BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE WITH THE\n$367 BILLION CAPITALIZATION THAT IS AMAZON.\nTHIS IS AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN GET TO BEING IMMUNE TO THE FED.\nTHE BOTTOM LINE IS YOU CAN BE PARALYZED.\nYOU CAN BE SIDELINED. YOU CAN DREAD THE FUTURE OR YOU\nCAN FIND SITUATIONS RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU THAT CAN BE BOUGHT.\nTHIS CAN BE BOUGHT BOTH BEFORE OR AFTER THE FETE IMMEDIATING\nJUST IN CASE THE FED DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AS LONG AS\nYOU AREN'T SO SCARED THAT YOU CAN'T THINK OR SO FRIGHTENED\nTHAT YOU REFUSE EVEN TO TRY TO MAKE MONEY ON WHAT YOU SEE, ON\nWHAT YOU KNOW, AND ON WHAT YOU LOVE.\nDARRYL IN CALIFORNIA. DARRYL.\n>> Caller: HI. I'VE OWN DISNEY STOCK FOR A FEW\nYEARS AND YOU HAVE SAID OWN IT, DON'T TRADE IT.\nWHAT DO YOU SAY NOW? >> I AM NOT DEVIATING FROM THAT.\nI THINK THAT ONE DAY DISNEY WILL GET OUT FROM UNDER THIS ESPN\nCONUNDRUM THAT PEOPLE ARE CUTTING THE CORD.\nWHY? BECAUSE THEY HAVE GOOD\nMANAGEMENT AND GOOD PROPERTIES. NOW, I AM SAYING NEAR TERM I\nDON'T SEE A CATALYST, OKAY? WE'VE HAD A LOT OF CATALYSTS.\nI'M NOT BEING OBLIVIOUS.

              "text": ">>> DID YOU SEE SAREPTA\nTHERAPEUTICS ROCKETING HIGHER TODAY?\nTHE SMALL CAP BIOTECH STOCK WAS CATAPULTED INTO THE\nSTRATOSPHERE, RALLYING NEARLY 74% ON NEWS THAT THE FDA HAD\nAPPROVED THEIR TREATMENT FOR MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, A GENETIC\nCONDITION THAT CAUSES MUSCULAR DEGENERATION AND KILLS MOST\nPATIENTS BY THE AGE OF 30. HERE'S THE THING ABOUT THE\nSTOCK. IT WAS OBLITERATED IN JANUARY\nWHEN THE FDA EXPRESSED DOUBTS ABOUT THE EFFICACY OF THE SAME\nDRUG. THAT NEWS CAUSE THE 9 STOCK TO\nPLUMMET DOWN TO $14 IN A SINGLE SESSION.\nNOW IT'S JUST UNDER 50 BUCKS, AND AFTER A YEAR WHERE\nEVERYTHING BIOTECH GOT HAMMERED BASES ON FEARS THAT WASHINGTON\nMIGHT TRY TO REGULATE DRUG PRICES, THE BULLS FINALLY HAD\nTHE LAST LAUGH HERE. I MENTION IT BECAUSE WHAT\nHAPPENED TO THIS COMPANY TODAY IS WHAT I CALL THE BEST CASE\nSCENARIO IN YOU'RE INVESTING IN A SPECULATIVE BIOTECH STOCK. FINALLY GOT FDA APPROVAL FOR\nSOME WONDER DRUG, WHICH THE COMPANY WILL ALWAYS BE ABLE TO\nMAKE A FORTUNE SELLING IT. I HEARD ABOUT PEOPLE TALKING\nABOUT IT AS A TAKEOVER TARGET. BUT NOT EVERY DEVELOPMENTAL\nSTAGE BIOTECH STORY PLAYS OUT THIS WAY.\nIN FACT, SOMETIMES THE DATA TURNS OUT TO BE DISAPPOINTING OR\nEVEN EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING, OR THE FDA BLOCKS A COMPANY'S KEY\nDRUG AND ITS STOCK GOES INTO FREE FALL.\nTHAT'S THE WORST CASE SCENARIO. THAT'S WHY THESE EARLY STAGE\nBIOTECHS ARE INHERENTLY SPECULATIVE.\nTHAT'S WHY I ALWAYS WARN YOU ABOUT THEM.\nSO LET'S CONSIDER A CASE THAT MANY OF YOU KNOW.\nLET'S CONSIDER SERI SERKS THERAPEUTICS.\nWE KNOW IT AS THE MICRO, MCRB IS THE LETTERS FOR THE SYMBOL.\nWE HAD SERIES ON A BUNCH OF TIMES.\nIPO, SUMMER OF 2015. I WAS IMPRESSED WITH THEIR\nSCIENCE. NOW, SERIES SPENT THE FIRST\nSEVEN MONTHS OF 2016 BOUNCING BETWEEN THE MID-20s AND THE\nMID-30s. BUT THEN DISASTER STRUCK.\nNEAR THE END OF JULY, SERE SERKS REPORTED SOME DISAPPOINTING\nCLINICAL TRIAL DATA FOR ITS KEY DRUG AND IN ONE DAY -- ONE\nDAY -- THE STOCK LOST NEARLY 70% OF ITS VALUE.\nIT PLUNGED FROM $35 DOWN TO $10 AND CHANGE.\nSINCE THEN, SERES HAS WORKED ELTHS WAY BACK UP TO $10.55, BUT\nTHE STOCK IS STILL DOWN HUGE FROM WHERE IT WAS TRADING TWO\nMONTHS AGO. SO WHAT REALLY WENT WRONG HERE\nWITH THIS ONCE PROMISING BIOTECH NAME THAT I KNOW A LOT OF YOU\nFELT WERE -- WELL, LET'S SAY PROMISING AS I DID?\nAND IS THERE ANY WAY IT CAN GET BACK ON TRACK?\nBEFORE WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO WITH THING, YOU HAVE TO\nUNDERSTAND WHAT THE COMPANY DOES.\nTO SIMPLIFY A COMPLICATED SUBJECT, IT'S FOCUSED ON\nCREATING A WHOLE NEW CLASS OF MEDICINES TO TREAT DISEASES\nCAUSED BY BIOCYSTS, WHICH IS THE TECHNICAL TERM FOR WHEN THE\nBACTERIAL ECOSYSTEM LIVING IN YOUR BODY SOMEHOW BECOMES\nIMBALANCED. YOU'VE GOT TRILLIONS OF\nDIFFERENT BACTERIA LIVING INSIDE YOU IN YOUR DIGESTIVE PACKS.\nYOU SEE THOSE FLORA DRUGS THAT MAKE YOUR DIGESTIVE TRACK RIGHT,\nWELL, THERE ARE BILLIONS IN THERE.\nTHEY'RE ESSENTIAL TO YOUR HEALTH THAT THEY WORK WELL.\nBUT WHEN THAT ECOSYSTEM GETS OUT OF WHACK, MAYBE YOU'VE GOT TOO\nMANY OF ONE KIND OF BACTERIA, TOO FEW OF ANOTHER, IT CAN MAKE\nYOU VERY SICK. SO SERES IS DEVELOPING\nCOMBINATIONS OF MICROBES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO MAKE THIS\nINTERNAL ECOSYSTEM HEALTHY AGAIN.\nTHE COMPANY'S LEAD DRUG, THE ONE THAT CAUSED THE STOCK TO IMPLODE\nOVER THE SUMMER, IS A SINGLE-DOSE PILL THAT PREVENTS\nRECURRENT CDI, AND THAT'S AN INFLAMMATION OF THE LARGE\nINTESTINE THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF HOSPITAL ACQUIRED\nINFECTIONS IN THE U.S. AND THIS TERRIBLE DISEASE KILLS\n29,000 AMERICANS A YEAR. NOW, SERES CAME UP WITH A\nTREATMENT THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE REVOLUTIONARY.\nRIGHT NOW IF YOU GET CDI, YOUR DOCTOR GIVES YOU ANTIBIOTICS BUT\nTHE ANTIBIOTICS ALSO DISRUPT THE HEALTHY BACTERIA IN YOUR GUT,\nMAKING IT LIKELY YOU'LL GET INFECTED ALL OVER AGAIN.\nIN OTHER WORDS, THE CURRENT STANDARD OF CARE CAN MAKE THIS\nDISEASE GO AWAY, BUT IT CAN'T MAKE THE DISEASE STAY AWAY.\nSERES THINKS THEY'VE COME UP WITH A WAY TO PREVENT CDI FROM\nOCCURRING BY GETTING YOUR GUT BACTERIA INTO HEALTHY\nEQUILIBRIUM. THIS DRUG IS CURRENTLY IN PHASE\nTWO CLINICAL TRIALS AND WITH SOME PRELIMINARY DATA FROM THIS\nTRIAL THAT CAUSED EVERYTHING TO GO WRONG FOR THE STOCK.\nWHAT HAPPENED? SERES TREATMENT WAS SUPPOSED TO\nREDUCE THE RELATIVE RISK OF CZI RECURRENCE, BUT AT EIGHT WEEKS\nIT HAD FAILED TO MEET ITS END POINT.\nWHILE THEIR DRUG DID DO BETTER THAN THE PLACEBO, THE DIFFERENCE\nWASN'T STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT, AND THAT'S WHAT\nCAUSED THE STOCK TO LOSE NEARLY 70% OF THE VALUE IN ONE DAY.\nALSO IT REALLY DOESN'T LOOK GOOD, I KNOW MANY OF YOU TOLD ME\nON TWITTER THAT THE CEO AND TWO OTHER EXECUTIVES SOLD BIG SLUGS\nOF STOCK RIGHT BEFORE THE NEWS BROKE.\nI SHOULD POINT OUT THAT THE SALES WERE MADE ON WHAT'S KNOWN\nAS A PREPROGRAMMED TRADING PLAN, AND THEREFORE IT'S UNRELATED TO\nTHE SUBOPTIMAL FINDINGS BUT I KNOW THAT DOESN'T MAKE YOU FEEL\nANY LESS AGGRIEVED. BUT -- THIS IS A VERY BIG BUT.\nTHE CEO REPEATEDLY STRESSED THE TRIAL DATA IS ONLY PRELIMINARY.\nTHE STUDY REMAINS ONGOING. IT'S SUPPOSED TO LAST 24 WEEKS,\nWHICH MEANS IT'S POSSIBLE THE FINAL DATA COULD LOOK A LOT\nBETTER, PARTICULARLY SINCE THE RESULTS IN THE PREVIOUS CLINICAL\nTRIAL WERE SO STRONG. SADLY, THAT WASN'T ENOUGH TO\nPREVENT THE ANALYSTS FROM GANGING UP ON THE STOCK.\nTHEY THINK IT'S LESS LIKELY THE DRUG WILL BE APPROVED.\nEVEN IF EVERYTHING DOES WORK OUT, THEY EXPECT THE PROCESS TO\nTAKE LONGER AFTER THE SET BACK. MANAGEMENT SAID THEY'RE\nCONDUCTING AN INTENSIVE ANALYSIS.\nI THINK THEY'RE BEING PRETTY RIGOROUS ABOUT IT.\nAT THE TIME SERES HAS OTHER BUT THEY'RE STILL IN PHASE ONE AND\nWE KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE YEARS BEFORE WE SEE ANYTHING.\nNOT A REASON TO OWN THE STOCK. SO WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?\nGENERALLY SPEAKING, NOTHING IS MORE BINARY THAN AN INFANT\nBIOTECH STOCK. EITHER YOUR DRUG GETS APPROVED\nOR IT FAILS. BINARY.\nEITHER YOU'RE ROCKETING TO THE SKY LIKE SAREPTA, OR YOU'RE\nPLUMMETING IN THE ABYSS LIKE  LIKELY GET FULL CLINICAL TRIAL\nRESULTS BY THE END OF THE YEAR AND AT THIS POINT IT SEEMS LIKE\nA NEGATIVE OUTCOME MAY BE BAKED INTO THE STOCK PRICE WHICH MEANS\nLIKE IF ANYTHING GOES RIGHT HERE, THEN SERES COULD HAVE\nTREMENDOUS UPSIDE. IF THE DATA REMAINS UGLY, THE\nSTOCK ALREADY HAS BEEN CRUSHED. SERES HAS A CLEAN BALANCE SHEET,\nNO DEBT, 211 MILLION IN CASH. THAT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS I\nTHOUGHT THEY HAD SUCH HIGH HOPES.\nNESTLE CLEARLY HAD CHECKED IT OUT.\nNESTLE IS A BIG TICKETED PARTNER.\nLET ME GIVE YOU THE BOTTOM LINE. I KNOW THERE'S NOT MUCH TO LIKE\nABOUT SERES THERAPEUTIC DOWN HERE.\nBUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING SOMETHING TO SPECULATE ON, I THINK THE\nRISK IS A LOT BETTER THAN WITH MANY OTHER BIOTECHS BECAUSE THIS\nONE HAS ALREADY BEEN LAID TO WASTE AND ANY GOOD NEWS WILL\nSEND IT SOARING. THIS IS FOR SFEKLATION ONLY, NOT\nAN INVESTMENT, WHICH MEANS YOU SHOULD ONLY PUT MONEY IN SERES\nOR SIMILAR EARLY-STAGE BIOTECHS IF IT'S MONEY YOU'RE WILLING TO\nLOSE. \"MAD MONEY\" IS BACK AFTER THE\nBREAK. >> IT IS TIME!\nIT'S TIME FOR THE LIGHTNING ROUND!\nWHEN YOU HEAR THIS SOUND -- [ BUZZER ]\n-- THEN THE LIGHTNING ROUND IS OVER.\nARE YOU READY, SKEE-DADDY? IT'S TIME FOR THE LIGHTNING\nROUND ON CRAMER'S \"MAD MONEY.\" LET'S START WITH LEE IN\nCALIFORNIA. LEE.\n>> Caller: BOOYAH. >> BOOYAH.\n>> Caller: BUY, SELL, OR HOLD COLOR AX?\n>> I'D LIKE TO HOLD IT. CLOROX IS DOING DOWN 18 STRAIGHT\nPOINTS FROM ITS HIGH. I DON'T KNOW, IF THAT STOCK\nBREAKS 120 AND GETS TO BE ALMOST A 3% YIELD, THEN I SAY WITHOUT\nHESITATION RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THAT GROUP IS REALLY UNDER\nPRESSURE. ALEX IN FLORIDA.\nALEX. >> Caller: HEY, JIM, BOOYAH, HOW\nARE YOU? >> ALL RIGHT.\nHOW ARE YOU? >> Caller: HEY, I'M GOOD.\nI GOT A REQUEST ON ENERGY NRP. I GOT THIS BACK IN MAY WHEN IT\nHIT ABOUT 16 AND STARTED GOING BACK UP, DROPPED OFF ABOUT A\nMONTH LATER AND THEN -- >> IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.\nTHIS THING IS LIKE $12, $11. I GOT TO TELL YOU I THINK IT'S\nWORTH MORE BUT THAT BALANCE SHEET IS NOT THAT GOOD.\nI DON'T WANT TO SELL IT DOWN HERE, BUT I GOT TO TELL YOU IF\nIT DOES GO BACK TO $16, $17, SELL, SELL, SELL.\nBARRY IN NEW YORK. BARRY.\n>> Caller: TEVA, BUY, HOLD OR SELL.\n>> THEY ARE FRONT AND CENTER. FRONT AND CENTER IN THE WAR.\nI WOULDN'T TOUCH THAT STOCK UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION.\nANDY IN CALIFORNIA. ANDY.\n>> Caller: HEY, JIM. A BIG LASD BOOYAH.\nHOW ARE YOU DOING? >> I DON'T KNOW THE SKEE-DADDYS.\n>> Caller: AK STEEL, ARE YOU STILL A BELIEVER?\n>> THIS THING IS UNBELIEVABLE. THEY GOT CUT IN HALF EVEN THOUGH\nI KNOW THAT -- THERE'S A SERIES OF PRICE CUTS NOW IN STEEL, BUT\nAT $4, I AM NOT A SELLER OF AK. NEW CORPS DID CUT ITS EARNINGS\nESTIMATES LAST WEEK AND THAT WAS VERY JARRING TO ME.\nSAMMY IN LOUISIANA, SAMMY. >> Caller: BOOYAH, JIM.\nYOU'RE ALWAYS GOING TO BE THE GREATEST NO MATTER WHAT.\n>> OH, SAMMY, THANK YOU. I MISS LOUISIANA.\nI'D LOVE TO GO BACK. WHAT'S HAPPENING?\n>> Caller: COME BY SHREVEPORT ONE DAY.\nTHAT WOULD BE COOL TOO. >> I'VE BEEN THERE MANY TIMES.\nTHE HOSPITALITY IS INCREDIBLE. HOW CAN I HELP?\n>> Caller: WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE STOCK KELLOGGS?\n>> THIS THING HAS GOT THREE DOWN AND FIVE UP.\nTHAT'S NOT THAT GREAT. THIS STOCK ACTS MUCH BETTER\nTHAN -- TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED WITH CAMPBELLS. KRAFT HEINZ TODAY JUST GOT\nCRASHED. I DO THINK THERE'S A BETTER RISK\nREWARD. LET'S GO TO HANS IN FLORIDA.\n>> Caller: I BOUGHT TRACTOR SUPPLY STOCKS IN MAY.\nSINCE THEN, IT HAS DROPPED 30% TO DATE, AND IT'S BASICALLY 20%\nDROP IN SEPTEMBER. >> I THINK IT'S WAY OVERDONE\nHANS. I REALLY HAVE TO TELL YOU I\nTHOUGHT THAT THE COMPANY -- I KNOW THE WEATHER WAS REALLY BAD.\nTHIS IS A WELL RUN COMPANY. I'M NOT GOING TO SELL THAT STOCK\nIN THE 60s. THAT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IS\nTHE CONCLUSION OF THE LIGHTNING",
