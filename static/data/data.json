HILLARY CLINTON SEEMED INFIRM\nAND HE WANTED TO SAY HOW LOOK HOW ROBUST I AM.\nTHE WAY HE'S DOING IT IS RAISING QUESTIONS.\nHE WENT ON DAYTIME TALK SHOW DR. OZ AND TALKED TO THE HOST ABOUT\nHIS HEALTH. THE INTERVIEW IS SET TO AIR\nTODAY. WE ALREADY DO KNOW ONE POINT.\nTRUMP USED THAT SAME CONTROVERSIAL DOCTOR, DR.\nBORNSTEEN TO REPORT HIS FINDINGS.\nTHE PRIMARY QUESTION, HOW HEALTHY IS THE 70-YEAR-OLD\nREPUBLICAN NOMINEE? FOR THAT SARAH MARIE IS LIVE IN\nNEW YORK WHERE TRUMP IS SCHEDULED TO SPEAK LATER TODAY.\nWHAT DO WE KNOW? >> WELL, GOOD MORNING, CHRIS.\nLOOK, WE KNOW THAT DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T EXERCISE ALL THAT MUCH.\nWE KNOW HE WANTS TO LOSE ABOUT 15 POUNDS.\nBUT WE DON'T KNOW A WHOLE LOT OF DETAILS AND THAT'S LARGELY\nBECAUSE EVEN THOUGH HE RELEASED THE RESULTS OF HIS RECENT\nPHYSICAL, HE HASN'T MADE THEM PUBLIC.\nHE DID RELY ON A LITTLE REALITY TELEVISION FLARE IN TERMS OF\nREVEALING ON TELEVISION. >> WHY NOT SHARE YOUR MEDICAL\nRECORDS? >> I REALLY HAVE NO PROBLEM IN\nDOING IT. I HAVE IT RIGHT HERE.\nSHOULD I DO IT? I DON'T CARE.\nIT'S TWO LETTERS. ONE IS THE REPORT AND THE OTHER\nIS FROM LENNOX HILL HOSPITAL. >> MAY I SEE THEM?\n>> YEAH, SURE. >> NOW, OF COURSE, ALL OF THIS\nCOMES AS THERE IS A MUCH BIGGER FOCUS ON TRANSPARENCY IN TERMS\nOF THE HEALTH OF BOTH OF THOSE CANDIDATES AND WHILE DONALD\nTRUMP HAS BEEN TAKING A RESPECTFUL TONE WHEN IT COMES TO\nNAVIGATING HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH ISSUES AT THE 9/11\nSERVICE, HE COULDN'T AVOID GETTING IN A DIG WHEN HE WAS\nCAMPAIGNING IN OHIO LAST NIGHT TAKING A SWIPE AT HILLARY\nCLINTON'S STAMINA. >> YOU THINK THIS IS SO EASY.\nIN THIS BEAUTIFUL ROOM THAT IS 122 DEGREES.\nI DON'T KNOW, FOLKS, DO YOU THINK HILLARY WOULD BE ABLE IS\nTO STAND UP HERE FOR AN HOUR AND DO IT?\nI DON'T THINK SO. >> STILL GOING TO BE RELATIVELY\nLIMITED INFORMATION, NOT A COMPLETE MEDICAL HISTORY LIKE\nWE'VE SEEN PREVIOUS NOMINEES PROVIDE.\nTHEY DON'T FEEL THE NEED TO RELEASE MUCH MORE BEYOND THAT.\nTRUMP SWITCHING GEARS ENTIRELY AND HERE AT THE WARDOLF\nHISTORIA. HOW HE IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE\nMANY PLANS HE RUPPROPOSED. >> THANKS FOR THAT REPORTING.\nLET'S DISCUSS EVERYTHING WE LEARNED WITH MARK PRESTON,\n\"WASHINGTON POST\" POLITICAL REPORTER AND DR. SANJAY GUPTA.\nGREAT TO HAVE ALL OF YOU HERE. THERE IS POLITICS AND HEALTH.\nLET ME START WITH YOU, SANJAY, ABOUT HER HEALTH.\nTWO-PAGE LETTER THAT HILLARY CLINTON'S DOCTOR RELEASED.\nFILLED WITH LAB RESULTS AND THE VITAMINS SHE'S ON AND WHAT SHE'S\nNOT DEFICIENT IN. WHAT DID YOU SEE IN READING THIS\nLETTER? >> FIRST OF ALL, IT'S A LETTER.\nIT'S NOT MEDICAL RECORDS. ALL THIS TALK WHETHER MEDICAL\nRECORDS ARE GOING TO BE RELEASED.\nNEITHER ONE HAD MEDICAL RECORDS RELEASED.\nTHE BIGGER THING WAS A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT HAPPENED TO\nTHE RECENT HEALTH EPISODE. THE PNEUMONIA.\nSHE GOT A C.A.T. SCAN TO DIAGNOSE THAT AND PUT ON\nANTIBIOTICS. TEN DAYS OF AN ANTIBIOTIC KNOWN\nAS LEVIQUIN. THROUGHOUT THE YEAR SHE HAD\nSEVERAL SCANS. CT SCAN OF HER SINUSES AND BRAIN\nAND CT SCAN OF HER LUNGS. >> BECAUSE SHE HAS SEASONAL\nALLERGIES AND SISINUSITIS. SOMETIMES YOU'LL DO THAT AND THE\nBRAIN SHOWED NO ABNORMALITIES WHICH IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE GOING\nBACK TO 2012 THERE WAS ALL THESE QUESTIONS WAS THERE SOME SORT OF\nINJURY TO THE BRAIN. THE CT HAS REPORTED NO EVIDENCE\nOF ABNORMALITIES. >> YOU'RE SATISFIED WITH THIS\nLETTER? >> WE'RE READING A SUMMARY OF\nSOMEONE'S INTERPRETATION OF ALL THE MEDICAL RECORDS.\n>> WHAT DO WE USUALLY GET? WHAT ARE WE COMPARING THIS TO AS\nA STANDARD? >> THIS IS TYPICALLY WHAT WE\nGET. IN 2008 JOHN McCAIN RELEASED HIS\nMEDICAL RECORDS ABOUT 1,000 PAGES AND I GOT A CHANCE TO LOOK\nAT THOSE, BUT, TYPICALLY, IT'S A LETTER LIKE THIS AND SOME TYPE\nOF SUMMARY BY A PHYSICIAN WHO HAS BEEN TREATING THE PERSON FOR\nA LONG TIME. >> HOW IS THIS PLAYING\nPOLITICALLY IN TERMS OF WHO LOOKS KN IN THIS AND WHO\nDOESN'T? >> SORT OF HARD TO SAY.\nI LIKE TO LOOK AT THE POLL NUMBERS AND THERE REALLY ISN'T\nPOLLING ON THIS YET. HOW MUCH INFORMATION WE EXPECT\nFROM OUR CANDIDATES. ONE THING THAT WE'RE SEEING OR\nBEING REINFORCED HERE IS A PARTISAN INTERPRETATION TO THAT.\nPEOPLE WHO LIKE DONALD TRUMP THINK HE HAS GIVEN ENOUGH\nINFORMATION ON HIS TAXES AND ENOUGH INFORMATION IN GENERAL\nAND PEOPLE FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHE QUESTION THAT IS REALLY INTERESTING UNDERCUTTING ALL\nTHIS IS WHAT IS THE STANDARD? SHOULD WE GIVE THOUSANDS OF\nPAGES OR IS A LETTER OF A SUMMARY ENOUGH?\nWHETHER SUCH A LETTER IS ENOUGH, PARTICULARLY WHEN THERE IS AN\nACUTE INCIDENT THAT HAPPENS. BUT, I THINK THAT MOSTLY VOTERS\nARE GOING TO LOOK AT THIS THROUGH THE LENS AT WHICH THEY\nLOOK AT THE CANDIDATES, EITHER POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY.\n>> HILLARY HAS THIS DOCTOR WHO, BY ALL ACCOUNTS, IS A REAL\nDOCTOR. TRUMP GOES ON DR. OZ AND, ONCE\nAGAIN, USES HIS DR. BORSTEIN. HE IS CONTROVERSIAL BY ANY\nMEASURE AND HE WROTE A LETTER THAT WAS RIDICULOUS THE FIRST\nTIME PUTTING OUT HIS FINDINGS. SO, THEY DID IT IN DIFFERENT\nWAYS. DOES ANY OF THAT MATTER?\n>> HONESTLY, I DON'T REALLY THINK SO.\nIF YOU ASK SOMEONE WHO IS A FERVENT TRUMP SUPPORTER HOW THEY\nFEEL ABOUT THE LETTER, THEY WOULD DISAGREE WITH YOUR\nASSESSMENT. A LOT OF OPRAISES IN THERE.\n>> THAT ENDS THE ANALYSIS OF THE LETTER.\nDOCTORS DON'T WRITE HYPERBOLIC LETTERS THAT ARE FILLED WITH\nCRAZY ASSESSMENTS OF WHAT SOMEBODY'S SUPREME HEALTH IS.\n>> SURE. >> DOESN'T MATTER HOW YOU FEEL\nABOUT IT. THAT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT DR.\nSANJAY GUPTA DOES IN A REAL LETTER ABOUT ANYTHING.\nAM I WRONG ABOUT THIS? >> LACKED IN OBJECTIVE DATA, AS\nWELL. IT DIDN'T HAVE SOME SIMPLE\nOBJECTIVE DATA THAT YOU WOULD LOOK AT FOR SOMEONE'S RISK OF\nHEART DISEASE AND DIFFERENT THINGS.\n>> DR. TRUMP'S HEALTH AND IT WAS NOT A REAL DISCLOSURE OF HIS\nMEDICAL RECORDS. HE HAD IN HIS POCKET ONE-PAGE\nLETTER THAT HE REVEALED ON DR. OZ AND DR. OZ GOT TO TAKE A LOOK\nAT. SO, DOES THAT POLITICALLY ANSWER\nANY LINGERING QUESTIONS? >> NO.\nLOOK, PHILIP IS RIGHT. WHAT A MADE FOR TV MOMENT WHEN\nHE SITS DOWN AND TELLS DR. OZ, WE'RE NOT GOING TO DISCUSS\nSPECIFICS OR SPECIFICS ABOUT IT AND SITS DOWN AND PULLS OUT THE\nPIECE -- LOOK WHAT I HAVE IN MY HAND HERE.\n>> IT'S GOOD TV. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT POLITICS.\nTHE POLITICS OF IT, THOUGH, HE IS TRYING TO REACH A\nCONSTITUENCY THAT HE'S NOT DOING GREAT WITH NOW.\nTHAT IS WOMEN. HE'S DOING WELL WITH MARRIED\nWOMEN, BUT NOT DOING WELL WITH SINGLE WOMEN.\nSO, WHEN HE GOES ON DR. OZ, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A\nCONSTITUENCY OF VIEWERSHIP THAT IS LARGELY COMPRISED OF WOMEN.\nTHAT'S WHY HE DID THAT. AND, GUESS WHAT, WE'RE GOING TO\nBE TALKING ABOUT IT ALL DAY TODAY, AS WELL.\nTO HIS POINT, HE THINKS THAT HE IS NOT ONLY HITTING THAT\nCONSTITUENCY, BUT HITTING THE MAIN STREAM MEDIA.\nIT IS WORTH NOTING, THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME THAT WE'VE HAD A\nPOLITICIAN GO ON A PROGRAM THAT IS NOT MAIN STREAM MEDIA\nNECESSARILY, RIGHT? WE'VE SEEN THE OBAMAS DO IT ALL\nTHROUGH -- >> CLINTON JUST WENT ON KIMMEL\nYOU KNOW IN THIS FIRST BRUSH ABOUT HEALTH AND SHE WAS JOKING\nABOUT IT. >> THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT\nVENUES, BUT CLEARLY A STUNT. >> HERE IS A MOMENT FROM DR. OZ\nAND DONALD TRUMP'S EXCHANGE. WATCH THIS.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT STAMINA. YOU USE THAT WORD A LOT.\nYOU MADE IT AN ISSUE IN THIS CAMPAIGN.\nYOU ARGUE THAT A PRESIDENT HAS TO HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF\nSTAMINA. IF ELECTED AT AGE 70 YOU WILL BE\nTHE OLDEST PERSON TO EVER ENTER THE OVAL OFFICE.\nWHY DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE THE STAMINA FOR THE JOB?\n>> JUST ABOUT THE SAME AGE AS RONALD REAGAN AND HILLARY IS A\nYEAR BEHIND ME. JUST BASED ON MY LIFE, I\nACTUALLY, I DON'T KNOW IF THIS MAKES SENSE, I FEEL AS GOOD\nTODAY AS I DID WHEN I WAS 30. >> SANJAY, WHAT ELSE WAS\nREVEALED ON THE SHOW ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S HEALTH?\n>> FIRST, I WISH I FELT AS GOOD AS I DID WHEN I WAS 30.\nWE'RE GOING TO, OBVIOUSLY, SEE THE FULL SHOW WHEN HE HAS THE\nRESULTS RELEASED LATER TODAY. I TALKED TO DR. OZ YESTERDAY AND\nASKED ABOUT THIS. ONE THING HE ZEROED IN ON WAS\nHEART. DR. OZ IS A HEART SURGEON.\nHE HAD A CT OF HIS HEART LOOKING FOR CALCIUM.\nTHAT LOOKED GOOD. ALSO AN ECOCARDIOGRAM OF HIS\nHEART AND VARIOUS LAB TESTS. HOW DR. OZ SORT OF SUMMARIZED IT\nFOR ME IS HE SAID THOSE TESTS ALL LOOK GOOD FOR A MAN OF HIS\nAGE. >> HIS WEIGHT WAS A QUESTION.\n>> HIS WEIGHT IS A QUESTION BECAUSE WE'RE NOT EXACTLY SURE\nWHAT HIS WEIGHT IS I HEARD 236 AND I HEARD 267 AND AUDIENCE\nMEMBERS HEARD THAT AND HE IS 6'3\" IN HEIGHT.\n>> THAT WOULD BE OVERWEIGHT. IF IT WERE 267 AND HE'S 6'2\" OR\n6'3\", HE WOULD BE OOBESE. >> BMI OF ANYTHING OVER 30 IS\nCONSIDERED OBESE. IF HE WAS 236 HE WOULD BE\nOVERWEIGHT. >> NOW, WE ALL RESPECT THE\nMEDICAL PROFESSION VERY MUCH, BUT THESE NUMBERS THAT WE'RE\nGETTING FROM THEM, WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE THAT THESE ARE THE\nNUMBERS, RIGHT? BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GETTING ANY\nRAW MATERIAL. HOW MUCH SKEPTICISM DO YOU FEEL\nCOMFORTABLE PUTTING INTO THIS? THIS ISN'T AN ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTHAT HAS FORENSICALLY GONE OVER DATA.\nDOCTORS WHO SANJAY HAS SAID IN THE PAST, A CULIE COLIEGEALITY .\nHOW MUCH BACKUP SHOULD WE ASK FOR WHEN WE HAVE NOT GOTTEN\nBACKUP BEFORE EXCEPT FOR McCAIN? >> I THINK THE QUESTION HERE IS\nA FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION OF BOTH TRUST OF THE CANDIDATE TO, YOU\nKNOW, A SECONDARY DEGREE TRUST TO THE PEOPLE THEY'RE HIRING TO\nPROVIDE THE INFORMATION. THAT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL\nQUESTION. IF YOU THINK DONALD TRUMP IS\nSOMEONE WHO SAYS HE WEIGHS 236 POUNDS INSTEAD OF 267.\nHE COULD STAND ON A SCALE -- >> THAT IS A DIFFERENT SHOW.\nTHAT IS \"THE BIGGEST LOSER\" SHOW.\n>> HE WOULD NEVER BE ON THAT SHOW.\nJUST THE TITLE ALONE. >> SO MANY QUESTIONS IN THIS\nCAMPAIGN WHERE WE HAVE TO TAKE THE CANDIDATES ON TRUST.\nMORE OF AN ISSUE THIS YEAR THAN WE HAVE SEEN IN PAST CAMPAIGNS\nBECAUSE SO MUCH OF THIS CAMPAIGN HAS QUESTIONED THE EXTENT TO\nWHICH WE CAN TRUST CANDIDATES IN GENERAL, MUCH LESS THESE TWO\nCANDIDATES. >> HE'S PLAYING TO AN ADVANTAGE\nHERE ANY WAY YOU LOOK AT IT. HILLARY CLINTON HAD THE EPISODE\nWHERE SHE FAINTED AND FELL ON TO THAT VAN.\nSHE HAD THE 2012 EPISODE AND NOT HIM.\nNEVER A CHECK ON HIS HEALTH. HE EATS McDONALD'S AND RUNS\nAROUND LIKE A MACHINE. >> THEY BOTH RUN AROUND LIKE A\nMACHINE IN TERMS OF THEIR STAMINA.\nI'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH VOTERS WANT TO HEAR ABOUT COLONOSCOPY\nRESULTS. >> ALL DAY.\n>> I LOOK AT THOSE IN MY FREE TIME.\nFORGET ABOUT WORK TIME. >>> DONALD TRUMP IS NOW ON TOP\nIN SEVERAL BATTLEGROUND STATE",

LET'S START OFF WITH THE FACT\nYOU JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH DR. OZ.\nHE TOLD YOU WHAT HE WAS SHOWN BY DONALD TRUMP.\n>> DR. OZ IS A CARDIO THORACIC SURGEON.\nWE DRILL DOWN ON THE HEART STUFF SPECIFICALLY.\nTHAT'S THE BIGGEST CONCERN FOR MOST PEOPLE IS HEART HEALTH.\nHE HAD A CORONARY CALCIUM SCAN. HE HAD EKGs AND AN ECHO\nCARDIOGRAM, DONALD TRUMP.

NEITHER ARE ENOUGH PROBABLY BUT\nWITH SECRETARY CLINTON'S REPORT, YOU DID GET A MORE DETAILED\nACCOUNTING, NOT ONLY OF SOME SPECIFIC HEALTH RETURNS BUT THE\nCT SCAN OF THE HEART, BRAIN, LUNGS THE MEDICATION SHE'S BEEN\nON AND SHE IS ON A BLOOD THINNER LOOKING AT HOW THEY ARE\nESTABLISHING WHAT BLOOD THINNER SHE SHOULD BE ON AND WHAT THE\nTEST RESULTS ARE HAVE BEEN. YOU DID GET A COMPLETE PICTURE.\nWE WILL SEE IF THERE IS MORE ON THE SHOW TOMORROW.\nRIGHT NOW THERE IS MORE INFORMATION ABOUT SECRETARY\nCLINTON THAN MR.

THIS IS VERY TRUMPIAN TO DO\nTHIS. DONALD TRUMP WAS THE HOST OF THE\nREALITY TV SHOW.

LET'S GO \"OUTFRONT.\"\n\u00e2\u0099\u00aa .\n>> HILLARY CLINTON RELEASING A MEDICAL STATEMENT.\nOFF THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL FOR A THIRD DAY IN A ROW AFTER NEARLY\nCOLLAPSING. THE OFFICIAL DIAGNOSIS IS MILD\nNON CONTAGIOUS BACTERIAL PNEUMONIA.\nCLINTON'S DOCTOR REVEALING SHE EXAMINED THE CANDIDATE MULTIPLE\nTIMES OVER THE PAST WEEK. CLINTON UNDERWENT A CAT SCAN TWO\nDAYS BEFORE THIS VIDEO NOW SEEN AROUND THE WORLD WAS CAPTURED.\nTHE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE TRYING TO GET INTO HER VAN AFTER LEAVING\nTHAT 9/11 MEMORIAL EVENT. DONALD TRUMP IN THE MEANTIME\nALSO SAW THE DOCTOR TODAY, TAPING THE DR. OZ TELEVISION\nSHOW. SURPRISING DR. OZ AND HIS STUDIO\nAUDIENCE WITH THIS. >> WHY NOT SHARE YOUR MEDICAL\nRECORDS? >> WELL I HAVE NO REALLY PROBLEM\nIN DOING IT. I HAVE IT RIGHT HERE?\nSHOULD I DO IT? I DON'T CARE.\nSHOULD I DO IT? IT'S TWO LETTERS.\nONE IS THE REPORT.

WE DIDN'T FIND OUT UNTIL SUNDAY\nWHEN YOU SAW THAT VIDEO YOU JUST PLAYED THAT SE HAD BEEN\nDIAGNOSED ON FRIDAY AND SHE'D SPENT THE WEEK PRIOR BEING MORE\nACCESSIBLE TO REPORTERS WITH THIS SORT OF TRYING TO CREATE\nMORE OF AN AIR OF TRANSPARENCY. SO SHE REALLY UNDERCUT HERSELF.\nSO HER CAMPAIGN TRYING TO MAKE SOME AEMDS THERE.\nPUTTING OUT SOME INFORMATION PEOPLE WERE DEMANDING.\nA COUPLE THINGS WE LEARNED THAT WERE INTERESTING, ONE WAS THAT\nSHE HAD HAD SYMPTOMS A WEEK PRIOR TO HER PNEUMONIA\nDIAGNOSIS. SO A FULL NINE DAYS BEFORE WE\nFOUND OUT. THAT SHE WAS AND THEN WE ALSO\nLEARNED THAT BACK IN JANUARY SHE HAD HAD SINUSITIS AND AN EAR\nINFECTION THAT GOT BAD ENOUGH WITH FLUID IN HER EAR THAT SHE\nHAD TO HAVE A TUBE INSERTED INTO HER LEFT EAR.\nTHAT IS LEAD UP TO THE IOWA CAUCUSES FULL STEAM AHEAD ON THE\nCAMPAIGN TRAIL AND SHE WENT THROUGH THAT.\nALL OF THIS INFORMATION COMING OUT BRINGS HER TO THE STANDARD\nOF MITT ROMNEY AND BARACK OBAMA IN 2012.\nNOT CERTAINLY TO THE STANDARD OF JOHN McCAIN WHERE REH EHNEHE RE\nPAGES OF MEDICAL RECORDS. BUT SHE HAS A LOT MORE OUT THERE\nTHAN DONALD TRUMP AND WE'VE KNOWN A LOT MORE ABOUT HER\nMEDICAL HISTORY OVER THE LAST YEAR THAN DONALD TRUMP.\nA DEEP VAIN THROMBOSIS. AND THE 2012 CONCUSSION SHE\nSUFFERED AFTER FAINTING THAT LED TO THE BLOOD CLOT BETWEEN HER\nSKULL AND BRAIN. >> DR. SANJAY GUPTA JOINS US\nNOW. AN EVALUATION OF WHAT YOU\nLEARNED. >> WE GOT A MUCH BETTER\nEXPLANATION AS BRIANNA SAID ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED OVER THE\nPAST FEW DAYS. THIS PNEUMONIA THAT WAS\nDIAGNOSED BY A CAT SCAN AS WELL. THIS YEAR IT IS INTERESTING\nSHE'S HAD A SCAN OF HER BRAIN, HER LUNGS AND OF HER HEART AS\nWELL. SHE HAS A HISTORY OF HEART\nDISEASE IN HER FAMILY. AND ALL THOSE LOOKED GOOD.\nKNOWING THAT HER BRAIN SCAN NOW LOOKS GOOD WAS AN IMPORTANT\nPOINT AFTER THE CONCUSSION. THIS IS NOT A FULL RELEASE OF\nMEDICAL RECORDS BY BIANY MEANS BUT AS BRIANNA SAID THIS IS MORE\nTHAN WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST AND CERTAINLY MORE THAN WE'VE SEEN\nFROM MR. TRUMP. >> AND ON THAT NOTE, TONIGHT WE\nARE LEARNING SOME NEW INFORMATION ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S\nHEALTH. BECAUSE HE GAVE THE RESULTS OF\nHIS RECENT PHYSICAL TO TV'S DR. OZ DURING A TAPED INTERVIEW.\nDR. OZ TELLING NBC NEWS HE WAS ACTUALLY CAUGHT OFF GUARD BY\nWHAT TRUMP REVEALED. HE DIDN'T EXPECT DONALD TRUMP TO\nHAND HIM THAT SHEET OF PAPER WITH THE DETAILS.\nHERE IS HOW HE PUT IT. >> I WAS, YOU KNOW, SURPRISED.\nI LOOKED AT THEM AND TRY TO PROCESS IT PRETTY QUICKLY.\nAND IF I WAS A DOCTOR, IF HE WAS MY PATIENT ARE THEY ARE GOOD FOR\nA MAN OF HIS AGE. >> WHAT DID IT SAID.\n>> DETAILS FROM A COLONOSCOPY HE HAD A FEW YEARS AGO.\nA CALCIUM SCAN OF HIS HEART THAT WAS DONE THAT LOOKED GOOD.\nHE HAD RESULTS FROM CHEST X-RAIES AND EKGS AND THE LABOTT\nRESULTS FROM LAST WEEK. >> TYPICALLY NOT THE WAY WE SEE\nCANDIDATES RELEASE THAT KIND OF INFORMATION AND THE DRAMA REALLY\nHEIGHTENED THIS MORNING BECAUSE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN SAYING NO\nTRUMP IS NOT GOING TO RELEASE THE RESULTS OF HIS PHYSICAL\nTODAY ON THE DR. OZ SHOW AND HEENEDED UP DOING JUST THAT,\nPULLING IT OUT OF HIS POCKET AND GIVING IT TO DR. OZ.\nTHIS IS JUST A ONE-PAGE SUMMARY OF THE PHYSICAL THAT HE HAD LAST\nWEEK. AND IT HAS NOT YET BEEN PUBLICLY\nRELEASED. THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN SAYS THEY\nWILL GET TO THAT TOMORROW. THEY LIKELY WILL RELEASE THAT\nTOMORROW. BUT CNN WAS OUTSIDE OF THE SHOW.\nWE TALKED TO MANY AUDIENCE MEMBERS WHO WERE INSIDE FOR THE\nTAPING AND -- SMALL PICTURE OF WHAT DONALD TRUMP'S HEALTH\nREALLY LOOKS LIKE. -- AUDIENCE MEMBER WHO SAYS SHE\nWEIGHS 236 POUNDS. HE SAYS HE DOES NOT EXERCISE AND\nTHAT HE WOULD LIKE TO LOSE BETWEEN 15 AND 20 POUNDS AND HE\nIS ON STATINS, DRUGS THAT HELP LOWER CHOLESTEROL LEVELS.\nTOMORROW WHEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS ANTICIPATED TO RELEASE THIS\nMEDICAL SUMMARY FROM HIS POSITION, IT SHOULD BE NOTED\nTHAT THIS STILL IS NOT ONE THE RESULT OF WHAT THAT PHYSICAL WAS\nLIKE BUT TWO NOT A FULL DISCLOSURE OF HIS MEDICAL\nHISTORY AND DOCUMENTS THAT WOULD BE MORE IN LINE WITH PREVIOUS\nPRESIDENTIAL NOMINEES. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nAND OUT FRONT NOW, PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FORMER DOCTOR.\nAND -- MAGGIE, JUST IN TERMS OF STYLE\nTODAY. YOU GET THE LETTER AND THE LIST\nOF THINGS FROM HILLARY CLINTON TODAY.\nDONALD TRUMP GOING OUT ON DR. OZ, AND I'VE GOT IT.\nHERE IT IS. AND NOW EVEN NOW WE'RE NOT\nGETTING THE FORMAL RESULTS PUBLICLY TILL TOMORROW.\n>> WHAT HAVE WE GOT? WE KNOW WHAT HE WEIGHS.\nTHAT IS THE NEW THING WE LEARNED.\nWE KNEW HE WAS ON STATIN BEFORE, A FORM OF, FROM THE VERY UNUSUAL\nLETTER HIS DOCTOR WROTE A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO.\nWE ALSO KNOW FROM THAT NOTE THAT THE DOCTOR SAID IN THAT LETTER\nTHAT TRUMP HAD LOST 15 POUNDS OVER THE PREVIOUS YEAR.\nI DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS TRUMP WEIGHED BEFORE.\nI DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS NOW.\nHE DID THIS WITH HIS USUAL STYLE.\nHE WASN'T GOING TO RELIES T. HE IS GOING TO RELIES IT.\nTHAT OBSCURES THE FACT THIS IS STILL A PRETTY LOW LEVEL OF\nDISCLOSURE FOR A PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE.\nAND I DON'T KNOW HOICH MORE WE'RE GOING SEE WHEN THEY MAKE\nTHE RELEASE LATER THIS WEEK. >> AND SANJAY, IN TERMS OF WHAT\nWE'RE GOING TO GET, ONE COULD PRESUME THE THINGS THAT WERE\nDISCUSSED IN THIS INTERVIEW WITH DR. OZ, CHOLESTEROL, STATINS,\nBLOOD PRESSURE, BUT WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE WHAT ELSE.\n>> AND I TALKED TO DR. OZ A LITTLE TODAY AS WELL.\nAND YOU HEARD HIM TALK ABOUT. HE'S A CARDIO THORACIC SURGEON\nSO CERTAINLY SOMETHING HE WAS LOOKING FOR WAS A HEART.\nAND EKGS AND THE CONNECTICUT -- CT SCAN OF THE HEART.\nTHOSE COULD BE IMPORTANT TESTS TO RELAY ANY CONCERNS ABOUT\nHEART DISEASE. >> WHEN HE ADMITS HE DOESN'T\nEXERCISE AND HE'S OVERWEIGHT. >> AND A STATIN DRUG.\nAND THAT IS WHAT YOU WOULD REALLY WANT TO ZERO O IN ON.\n>> AND DOCTOR, FIRST OF ALL, YOU ARE SUPPORTING HILLARY CLINTON.\nBUT YOU HAVE TOLD ME ON THE SHOW THAT YOU WANTED A FULL\nNEUROLOGICAL EXAM. YOU WANTED THOSE RESULTS.\nOBVIOUSLY WE'RE NOT GETTING A FULL MEDICAL HISTORY HERE IN\nEITHER CASE. WE CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE THAT ON\nTHE NEURALLOGICAL SIDE. ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH WHAT YOU\nNOW HAVE. >> I WAS VERY IMPRESSED SHE GOT\nA CT SCAN. BY THAT ALONE I'M VERY IMPRESSED\nWITH HER DOCTOR. BUT I THINK BOTH KLDS SHOULD\nHAVE WHAT WE CALL NEUROPSYCHOLOGIC TESTING.\n-- BOTH CANDIDATES. I THINK SHE NEEDS\nNEUROPSYCHOLOGIC TESTING JUST TO SEE THERE'S NO NEUROLOGIC\nSEQUELAE FROM HER INJURY. AND TRUMP I THINK NEEDS A\nNEUROPSYCHOLOGIC BECAUSE OF HIS ERRATIC BEHAVIOR.\nIF SOMEBODY CAME INTO MY OFFICE WITH THAT KIND OF -- THE KIND OF\nTHINGS THAT HE DOES, I WOULD REALLY BE WONDERING ABOUT THE\nPERSONALITY. I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S -- WE KNOW\nHE'S GOT A NARCISSISTIC PERSONALITY DISORDER AT THE VERY\nLEAST. BUT I SOMETIMES WONDER IF HE\nWOULD EVEN BE HYPOMANIC. BUT I THINK PSYCHOLOGIC TESTING\nWOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR HIM. IS SOMETHING I THINK MAYBE\nSHOULD BE FOR ALL CANDIDATES. >> WHEN YOU SAY ALL CANDIDATES\nAND OBVIOUSLY THERE IS SOME SPECULATION IF WHAT THE DOCTOR\nWAS SAYING THERE. GOING THIS IS GOING TO BE THE\nFINAL POINT OF THIS. WE'RE NOT GOING GET A DEEP\nMEDICAL HISTORY FROM EITHER ONE. >> OF COURSE NOT.\nTHERE IS NO LAW THAT REQUIRES ANY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE NEEDS\nTO PUT ANY RECORDS OUT QUITE FRANKLY.\nAS FAR AS ANY KIND OF MENTAL TESTING.\nLAST TIME I THINK WE EVEN SAW THAT WAS BACK IN McGOVERN IN\n'72. AND [INDISCERNIBLE]\n. WHAT WE SAW TODAY WAS A MADE FOR\nTV MOMENT THAT DONALD TRUMP CREATED AND HE DID IT ON A SHOW\nTO TRY TO REACH A CERTAIN VOTER, WHICH WAS WOMEN.\nAND AS MAGGIE SAID, IT WAS A GAME FOR DONALD TRUMP.\n>> BUT THAT IS THE AUDIENCE HE NEEDS TO REACH.\nAND THAT IS THE AUDIENCE OF THAT SHOW.\n>> IT IS THE AUDIENCE HE NEEDS TO REACH IT'S INTERESTING\nBECAUSE WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS A SUMMARY THAT SOMEONE ELSE HAS\nPUT TOGETHER, USUALLY WITH INPUT FROM THE CAMPAIGN OF THE MEDICAL\nRECORDS BY SOMEONE WHO MAY ALSO BE A FRIEND OR AT LEAST HAVE A\nCOLLEGIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CANDIDATE.\nYOU HAVE TO TAKE ALL THAT INTO ACCOUNT.\nPART OF THE REASON YOU ASK FOR THE MEDICAL RECORDS.\nSO YOU CAN GET DISPASSIONATE REVIEW.\nBUT THE POINT IS WE DON'T KNOW EVEN WHAT WE DON'T KNOW.\nNOT TO SUGGEST THERE IS SOMETHING THERE.\nWE DON'T KNOW. THAT IS SORT OF THE POINT.\nI DON'T KNOW THAT WE SHOULD BE MAKING DIAGNOSES, EVEN\nPSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSES FROM ITHE. IT WAS INTERESTING AT THE END OF\nSECRETARY CLINTON'S NOTE THE DOCTOR WROTE \"I BELIEVE HER\nMENTAL HEALTH IS GOOD\". >> SHE'S NOT A PSYCHIATRIST.\n>> RIGHT. >> IN BOTH CASES THEY ARE\nGETTING LETTERS FROM DOCTORS WHO HAVE KNOWN THEM AND WORKED WITH\nTHEM FOR MANY, MANY YEARS.

THAT WAS AUGUST 24th.\nKELLYANNE CONWAY WAS TELLING ME, YES, PERHAPS, DONALD TRUMP\nSHOULD RELEASE MORE COMPLETE MEDICAL INFORMATION.\nTHAT WAS AUGUST 24th. TWO DAYS LATER, AUGUST 26th, NBC\nNEWS SCORED AN INTERVIEW WITH THAT DOCTOR WHO HAD RELEASED A\nLETTER. IN THAT INTERVIEW, DONALD\nTRUMP'S GASTROINTEROLOGIST SAID THAT HE WROTE THAT LETTER IN\nABOUT FIVE MINUTES WHILE A DONALD TRUMP STAFFER STOOD\nOUTSIDE AND WAITED FOR IT. HE SAID SOME OF THE MORE OVER\nTHE TOP STATEMENTS IN THAT LETTER, THE ASTONISHINGLY\nHEALTHY LAB RESULTS, THAT WAS MEANT AS A JOKE.\nTWO DAYS AFTER THAT, DONALD TRUMP TWEETED THAT HE AGREED, HE\nSHOULD RELEASE MORE DETAILED MEDICAL RECORDS.\nAND THEN A WEEK LATER, DONALD TRUMP TOLD ABC NEWS THAT HE\nWOULD RELEASE FURTHER INFORMATION ON HIS HEALTH\nWHETHER OR NOT HILLARY DID AS WELL.\n>> DO YOU THINK HILLARY CLINTON DESERVES TO HEAR MORE ABOUT YOU.\n>> I WOULD LOVE TO GIVE SPECIFICS, AS FAR AS I'M\nCONCERNED AND IF SHE WANTS TO GO FIRST --\n>> WHY DON'T YOU GO FIRST? >> NOW THAT YOU ASK, I THESE I\nWILL DO THAT. >> NOW THAT YOU ASK -- BY THE\nEND OF THAT WEEK, WHICH IS LAST WEEK, WE GOT THIS ANNOUNCEMENT\nFROM THIS DAYTIME TV SHOW, THE DR. OZ SHOW ANNOUNCING THAT\nDONALD TRUMP WOULD BE APPEARING ON THAT DAYTIME TV SHOW WITH\nTHAT TV DOCTOR TO TALK ABOUT MR. DONALD TRUMP'S HEALTH.\nYESTERDAY THE HOST OF THAT DAYTIME TALK SHOW DR. OZ WENT ON\nFOX NEWS RADIO AND SAID TRUMP WOULD BE ACTUALLY HANDING OVER\nHIS MEDICAL RECORDS TO DR. OZ, TO THE HOST OF THAT TV SHOW LIVE\nON TV. THE MEDICAL RECORDS WOULD BE\nREVEALED ON TV. THEN INTERESTINGLY THIS MORNING\nTHAT WAS OFF. TRUMP TELLING REPORTERS THEY HAD\nBASICALLY CHANGED THEIR MIND, THEY WOULD NOT BE HANDING OVER\nTHEIR MEDICAL RECORDS OVER ON YOUR TV SHOW.\n>> JOHN ROBERTS JUST REPORTED A LITTLE WHILE AGO THAT HE'S GOING\nTO GO ON DR. OZ TODAY, BUT THAT HE IS NOT GOING TO RELEASE THE\nRESULTS OF HIS PHYSICAL, WHY IS THAT?\n>> ON A TV SHOW? I DON'T THINK THAT --\n>> THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL PLAN, WASN'T IT?\n>> UH, NO. >> UH, YES.\n>> THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN FOLLOWED THAT UP TODAY, THAT APPEARANCE\nBY THE CAMPAIGN MANAGER THIS MORNING ON FOX, NO, THAT WAS\nNEVER THE PLAN, WE WERE NEVER GOING TO DO THAT, FOLLOWING UP\nBY INSISTING TO REPORTERS THAT IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS THAT TRUMP\nWAS NOT GOING TO RELEASE HIS MEDICAL RECORDS OR THE RESULTS\nOF HIS LAB TESTS ON THAT TV SHOW, NEVER.\nAND TODAY WENT ON THAT TV TALK SHOW, AND SURPRISE, WITH A\nFLOURISH, HE HANDED OVER WHAT HE SAID WERE HIS MEDICAL RECORDS,\nOR AT LEAST THE DESCRIPTION OF HOW HE DID AT HIS RECENT\nPHYSICAL. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE.\nNO REPORTERS WERE AT IT THE TAPING, NOTHING HAS BEEN\nRELEASED PUBLICLY, WE'RE TOLD THAT WHAT HE HANDED OVER ON TV\nWAS A ONE PAGES MEDICAL SUMMARY FROM OUR OLD FRIEND DR.\nBORNSTEIN. I'M NOT SURE IF THERE ARE JOKES\nIN THIS ONE TOO. WE CAN REPORT THAT THE HOST OF\nTHE TV SHOW, DR. OZ HAD NEVER SEEN THAT DOCUMENT, WHAT WAS IT\nWAS BEFORE DONALD TRUMP HANDED IT TO HIM.\nSO IT'S NOT LIKE HE DID A LOT OF READING ABOUT WHAT HE HAD FOUND.\nIN THEIR VIEW THE WHOLE SPECTACLE DONALD TRUMP HAS\nCREATED ARRANGE THIS WHOLE ISSUE IS IN THAT WORDS RIDICULOUS.\nACCORDING TO THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN, DONALD TRUMP IS,\nQUOTE, MAKING A MOCKERY OF THIS. AND SO, ULTIMATELY, BOTTOM LINE,\nWE HAVE STILL GOT NOTHING. AND MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T CARE.\nBUT THE DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN REMAINS THE ONLY PRESIDENTIAL\nCAMPAIGN IN U.S. HISTORY TO HAVE MADE SUCH A HASH AND SUCH A\nBIZARRE SPECTACLE OUT OF WHAT IS USUALLY A TOTALLY RUN OF THE\nMILL PART OF THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.\nAND THERE'S ALL THESE SERIOUS CONCERNS SWIRLING AROUND THE\nTRUMP FOUNDATION AND HOW TRUTHFUL TRUMP AND HIS CAMPAIGN\nHAVE BEEN ABOUT THAT FOUNDATION AND WHOSE MONEY THAT FOUNDATION\nIS GIVING AWAY ANYWAY. AND WITH THIS NEW DAMMING\nDOCUMENT SITUATION, UNLESS HE DRASTICALLY SERVED HIMSELF FROM\nHIS LIFE EELS WORK AND HIS BUSINESS INTERESTS, TODAY\nBASICALLY GETTING THE HOOK AND GETTING YANKED OFF STAGE IN\nFLINT, MICHIGAN TONIGHT BY THAT PASTOR, IF YOU'RE GOOD AT BEING\nA SHOWMAN, YOU CAN DISTRACT FROM ALL THAT, BY SHOWING A SHOWMAN'S\nSERVICE. A REAL SHOWMAN CAN -- THERE'S\nBEEN NO RELEASE OF INFORMATION ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S HEALTH.\nNOBODY OTHER THAN THAT GUY ON TV HAS SEEN ANYTHING NEW ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP'S HEALTH TODAY, EVEN THOUGH A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE\nCONVINCED THEMSELVES THAT HE'S MADE SOME NEW DISCLOSURE ABOUT\nHIS HEALTH. A GREAT SHOWMAN CAN PICK ANY ONE\nTHING AND BE SO RIDICULOUS ABOUT IT THAT EVERYBODY STOPS WHATEVER\nTHEY WERE PAYING ATTENTION TO BEFORE AND PAYS ATTENTION TO\nTHAT RIDICULOUS CIRCUS INSTEAD, AND NOT ONLY DO WE PAY FOR THE\nPRIVILEGE OF PAYING ATTENTION TO IT.\nTHAT'S WHAT SHOWMANSHIP IS, IT'S A CON, BUT IT'S VERY COMPELLING.\nTHIS IS A WEIRD DAY IN THE NEWS, BUT A LOT OF WHAT HAPPENED IN\nTODAY'S NEWS MAKE ME FEEL LIKE I NEED TO WASH.\nWE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. >> WHY NOT SHARE YOUR MEDICAL\nRECORDS? WHY NOT --\n>> I HAVE NO REAL PROBLEM IN DOING IT.\nI HAVE IT RIGHT HERE? SHOULD I DO IT?\nI DON'T CARE. >>> IF ELECTED AT AGE 70, YOU\nWILL BE THE OLDEST PERSON TO EVER ENTER THE OVAL OFFICE.\n>> JUST ABOUT THE SAME AGE AS RONALD REAGAN AND HILLARY'S A\nYEAR BEHIND ME.

REALLY HOW GREAT DO YOU FEEL?\nDONALD TRUMP APPEARING ON A DAYTIME TV SHOW, EARLIER TAPED\nTODAY, IT'S DUE TO AIR TOMORROW. DURING THAT TAPING MR. DONALD\nTRUMP HANDED OVER WHAT HE SAID WERE SOME KIND OF MEDICAL RECORD\nPREPARED BY HIS DOCTOR WHO HE SAYS GAVE HIM A PHYSICAL EXAM\nLAST WEEK. JOINING US NOW IS OUR MEDICAL\nNEWS CONTRIBUTOR. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.\n>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME. >> DID WE ACTUALLY LEARN ANY\nSUBSTANTIVE MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT DONALD TRUMP TODAY OR ARE\nWE SORT OF WAITING FOR A DOCUMENT?\n>> WE'RE STILL WAITING TO ACTUALLY VISUALIZE THE DOCUMENT\nTHAT DR. OZ HIMSELF SAW TODAY. WHAT I STILL DIDN'T HEAR IS A\nLIST OF MEDICAL PROBLEMS. IT'S JUST -- WE LIKE TO BE\nSYSTEMATIC ABOUT THESE THINGS, WHAT WE KNOW ARE THE MEDICINES\nTHAT HE TAKES, AND FROM THAT YOU CAN INFER WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS\nHE HAS. BUT I THINK WHAT WAS IN THE\nLETTER TODAY WERE SOME RESULTS OF PREVIOUS EKGs, CHEST X RAY,\nCOLONOSCOPY, LABS FROM LAST WEEK, WHICH WERE REPORTEDLY\nNORMAL. HE WAS EXAMINED LAST WEEK AND\nACCORDING TO THE IMPRESSION FROM DR. OZ, THERE WAS NOTHING\nUNTOWARD ABOUT HIS PHYSICAL EXAM.\nWE DID HEAR ABOUT HIS WEIGHT AND",

AFTER THAT SHE'S GOING TO SPEND\nTHE NEXT FEW DAYS HERE IN WASHINGTON.\nAND SHE DID RELEASE THAT TWO-PAGE -- I SHOULD SAY THAT\nEXTENSIVE LETTER FROM HER DODGE TORE SAYING A NUMBER OF THINGS\nSAYING SHE HAS BEEN ON A BLOOD THINNER TO MAKE SURE SHE'S SAFE\nFROM BLOOD CLOTS WHICH SHE HAS SUFFERED FROM IN THE PAST.\nSHE HAS LOW CHOLESTEROL, ACCORDING TO HER DOCTOR, AND IS\nNOT ONLY HEALTHY AND FIT TO SERVE, BUT THIS WAS AN\nINTERESTING NOTE, IS MENTALLY IN EXCELLENT CONDITION SHE NOTED\nTHAT LETTER. THEN THERE'S DONALD TRUMP WHO\nDID THAT PIECE YOU SAW IN \"THE DR. OZ SHOW\" THAT EVERYONE ELSE\nWILL SEE TODAY WHERE HE RELEASED NOT NECESSARILY DETAILED MEDICAL\nHISTORY BUT CERTAINLY THE MOST RECENT SCREENINGS THAT HE'S HAD\nALONG WITH SOME A LITTLE BIT BEFORE THAT WHERE DR. OZ SORT OF\nQUICKLY LOOKED THROUGH THEM. HE TOLD US IN AN INTERVIEW LATER\nHE DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO REVIEW THEM IN ADVANCE, SO HE'S QUICK\nLIG LOOKING THROUGH THEM. HE THINKS HE'S IN EXCELLENT\nSHAPE, COULD STAND TO EXERCISE AND EAT A LITTLE BETTER.\nHE LIKES FAST FOOD. AS YOU SAID, LOSE A FEW POINTS.\nWHAT'S INTERESTING IS 70 YEARS OLD AND 68 YEARS OLD.\nDONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON, THE TWO OLDEST IF\nELECTED TO EVER TAKE OFFICE. AND THIS HEALTH ISSUE HAS BECOME\nA REAL ISSUE FOR BOTH OF THEM. >> TRACIE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nTRACIE POTTS FROM NBC NEWS. I COULDN'T DO WHAT THEY'RE\nDOING. >> DO YOU WANT TO COME TO WORK\nLIKE THAT EVERY DAY? >> IT'S GRUELING.\nABSOLUTELY GRUELLING. >> THEY'RE THE OLDEST AS TRACIE\nSAID. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO RELEASE\nEVERYTHING. IMAGINE YOU'VE GOT 90 WARTS ON\nYOUR HAND. >> WHAT IMPACT WILL TRUMP HAVE\nON THE ECONOMY ACCORDING TO ONE, TRUMP COULD WIPE A TRILLION FROM\nTHE ECONOMY.

TWO DAYS LATER, AUGUST 26th, NBC\nNEWS SCORED AN INTERVIEW WITH THAT DOCTOR WHO HAD RELEASED A\nLETTER. IN THAT INTERVIEW, DONALD\nTRUMP'S GASTROINTEROLOGIST SAID THAT HE WROTE THAT LETTER IN\nABOUT FIVE MINUTES WHILE A DONALD TRUMP STAFFER STOOD\nOUTSIDE AND WAITED FOR IT. HE SAID SOME OF THE MORE OVER\nTHE TOP STATEMENTS IN THAT LETTER, THE ASTONISHINGLY\nHEALTHY LAB RESULTS, THAT WAS MEANT AS A JOKE.\nTWO DAYS AFTER THAT, DONALD TRUMP TWEETED THAT HE AGREED, HE\nSHOULD RELEASE MORE DETAILED MEDICAL RECORDS.\nAND THEN A WEEK LATER, DONALD TRUMP TOLD ABC NEWS THAT HE\nWOULD RELEASE FURTHER INFORMATION ON HIS HEALTH\nWHETHER OR NOT HILLARY DID AS WELL.\n>> DO YOU THINK HILLARY CLINTON DESERVES TO HEAR MORE ABOUT YOU.\n>> I WOULD LOVE TO GIVE SPECIFICS, AS FAR AS I'M\nCONCERNED AND IF SHE WANTS TO GO FIRST --\n>> WHY DON'T YOU GO FIRST? >> NOW THAT YOU ASK, I THESE I\nWILL DO THAT. >> NOW THAT YOU ASK -- BY THE\nEND OF THAT WEEK, WHICH IS LAST WEEK, WE GOT THIS ANNOUNCEMENT\nFROM THIS DAYTIME TV SHOW, THE DR.

OZ WENT ON\nFOX NEWS RADIO AND SAID TRUMP WOULD BE ACTUALLY HANDING OVER\nHIS MEDICAL RECORDS TO DR. OZ, TO THE HOST OF THAT TV SHOW LIVE\nON TV. THE MEDICAL RECORDS WOULD BE\nREVEALED ON TV. THEN INTERESTINGLY THIS MORNING\nTHAT WAS OFF. TRUMP TELLING REPORTERS THEY HAD\nBASICALLY CHANGED THEIR MIND, THEY WOULD NOT BE HANDING OVER\nTHEIR MEDICAL RECORDS OVER ON YOUR TV SHOW.\n>> JOHN ROBERTS JUST REPORTED A LITTLE WHILE AGO THAT HE'S GOING\nTO GO ON DR.

I DON'T THINK THAT --\n>> THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL PLAN, WASN'T IT?\n>> UH, NO. >> UH, YES.\n>> THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN FOLLOWED THAT UP TODAY, THAT APPEARANCE\nBY THE CAMPAIGN MANAGER THIS MORNING ON FOX, NO, THAT WAS\nNEVER THE PLAN, WE WERE NEVER GOING TO DO THAT, FOLLOWING UP\nBY INSISTING TO REPORTERS THAT IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS THAT TRUMP\nWAS NOT GOING TO RELEASE HIS MEDICAL RECORDS OR THE RESULTS\nOF HIS LAB TESTS ON THAT TV SHOW, NEVER.\nAND TODAY WENT ON THAT TV TALK SHOW, AND SURPRISE, WITH A\nFLOURISH, HE HANDED OVER WHAT HE SAID WERE HIS MEDICAL RECORDS,\nOR AT LEAST THE DESCRIPTION OF HOW HE DID AT HIS RECENT\nPHYSICAL. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE.\nNO REPORTERS WERE AT IT THE TAPING, NOTHING HAS BEEN\nRELEASED PUBLICLY, WE'RE TOLD THAT WHAT HE HANDED OVER ON TV\nWAS A ONE PAGES MEDICAL SUMMARY FROM OUR OLD FRIEND DR.\nBORNSTEIN. I'M NOT SURE IF THERE ARE JOKES\nIN THIS ONE TOO. WE CAN REPORT THAT THE HOST OF\nTHE TV SHOW, DR. OZ HAD NEVER SEEN THAT DOCUMENT, WHAT WAS IT\nWAS BEFORE DONALD TRUMP HANDED IT TO HIM.\nSO IT'S NOT LIKE HE DID A LOT OF READING ABOUT WHAT HE HAD FOUND.\nIN THEIR VIEW THE WHOLE SPECTACLE DONALD TRUMP HAS\nCREATED ARRANGE THIS WHOLE ISSUE IS IN THAT WORDS RIDICULOUS.\nACCORDING TO THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN, DONALD TRUMP IS,\nQUOTE, MAKING A MOCKERY OF THIS. AND SO, ULTIMATELY, BOTTOM LINE,\nWE HAVE STILL GOT NOTHING. AND MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T CARE.\nBUT THE DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN REMAINS THE ONLY PRESIDENTIAL\nCAMPAIGN IN U.S. HISTORY TO HAVE MADE SUCH A HASH AND SUCH A\nBIZARRE SPECTACLE OUT OF WHAT IS USUALLY A TOTALLY RUN OF THE\nMILL PART OF THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.\nAND THERE'S ALL THESE SERIOUS CONCERNS SWIRLING AROUND THE\nTRUMP FOUNDATION AND HOW TRUTHFUL TRUMP AND HIS CAMPAIGN\nHAVE BEEN ABOUT THAT FOUNDATION AND WHOSE MONEY THAT FOUNDATION\nIS GIVING AWAY ANYWAY.

AND YOU WONDER WHAT KIND OF\nPRESSURE THIS IS GOING TO PUT ON HILLARY CLINTON AND HER CAMP TO\nRELEASE MORE OF HER MEDICAL HISTORY BECAUSE ACCORDING TO DR.\nOZ, HE WENT THROUGH A FULL REVIEW OF TRUMP'S SYSTEMS, AND\nLAUNDRY LISTED NERVOUS SYSTEM, HEAD AND NECK, HORMONE LEVELS,\nCARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH.

SO SHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO GO ON\nSOME REALITY TV SHOW AND RELEASE ALL OF HER -- SERIOUSLY\nSPEAKING, SHE IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE MORE FORTHCOMING\nPARTICULARLY AFTER THIS HEALTH SCARE OVER THE WEEKEND.\n>> ABOUT THE WEIGHT LOSS YOU HEARD, APPARENTLY DONALD TRUMP\nSAID TO DR. OZ HE WOULD LIKE TO LOSE 15 TO 20 POUNDS, DR. OZ\nAGREED IS WHAT DR. OZ'S SHOW HAS TOLD US.\nFORMER SECRETARY OF STATE COLON POWELL REVEALING, CHRIS, HOW HE\nREALLY FEELS ABOUT BOTH OF THESE CANDIDATES.\nHACKERS LEAKING COLON POWELL'S PRIVATE E-MAILS.\nPOUFL WAS CALLING TRUMP A NATIONAL DISGRACE AND AN\nINTERNATIONAL PARIAH. HE ALSO SLAMS CLINTON FOR TRYING\nTO MAKE HIM A SCAPEGOAT IN THE HER E-MAIL SCANNEDING SAYING I\nTOLD HER STAFF THREE TIMES. I HAD TO THROW A MINI TANTRUM TO\nGET THEIR ATTENTION. SHE KEEPS TRIPPING INTO THESE\nCHARACTER MINE FIELDS. WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THESE\nE-MAIL REVELATIONS, CHRIS? >> WELL, I HAVE TO SAY, I MAKE\nMORE OF WHAT POWELL IS SAYING ABOUT CLINTON.\nPOWELL HAS BECOME A REPUBLICAN IN NAME ONLY.\nIF YOU REMEMBER HE SUPPORTED BARACK OBAMA AGAINST McCAIN IN\n2008, OBAMA AGAINST ROMNEY IN 2012, SO NO SURPRISE THAT HE\nWOULD NOT -- THE LANGUAGE IS KIND OF TOUGH, BUT NO SURPRISE\nTHAT HE WOULDN'T HAVE MUCH USE FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nBUT YOU CAN TELL, HE IS GENUINELY UPSET BY THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGNS. AND IT HAS BEEN AN EFFORT ON\nTHEIR PART TO SAY WELL SHE WAS JUST FOLLOWING THE ADVICE OF\nCOLON POWELL WHEN SHE SAID UP THIS PRIVATE SYSTEM.\nTHE FACT IS, THEY WERE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS.\nPOWELL DIDN'T HAVE A PRIVATE SERVER IN HIS BASEMENT, HE WAS\nUSING AOL.COM BACK IN 2005, OR 2000 RATHER, BACK WHEN THE WHOLE\nE-MAIL SYSTEM AND THE INTERNET WAS ALL COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.\nSO, YOU KNOW, I THINK WITH SOME JUSTICE, HE IS UPSET AT THE\nIDEAS. HE IS TRYING TO DRAG HIM INTO\nTHIS AND MAKE IT SEEM LIKE HE WAS THE REASON THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON SET UP THE PRIVATE SERVER.\n>> THERE WAS ALSO AN E-MAIL EXCHANGE WITH A DEMOCRATIC E\nMEGA DONOR, JEFFREY LEADS WAS IN THERE DEPICTING HER AS A SORE\nLOSER WHEN SHE LOST TO BARACK OBAMA SAYING SHE HATES THAT THE\nPRESIDENT KICKED HER BUTT IN 2008.\nSHE USED A DIFFERENT WORD THERE, BUT HE WENT ON TO SAY NO ONE\nLIKES HER AND THE CRIMINAL THING AIN'T OVER.\nI DON'T THINK THE PRESIDENT WOULD WEEP IF SHE FOUND HERSELF\nIN REAL LEGAL TROUBLE. WAS THIS ALSO VERY REVEALING OF\nTHE JITTERS THAT THE PARTY, THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN GENERAL IS\nFEELING RIGHT NOW OVER HILLARY CLINTON AND RECENT POLLING?\n>> OH SURE. LOOK, THIS RACE IS TIGHTENING,\nAND IT'S TIGHTENING I THINK FOR TWO REASONS.\nONE, DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN A MORE DISCIPLINED, BETTER\nCANDIDATE OVER THE LAST THREE, FOUR WEEKS SINCE HIS NEW TEAM\nTOOK OVER, AND AGAIN, THIS GOES TO THE PERSONALITY TRANSPLANT.\nHE IS DELIVERING MORE SPEECHES ON TELEPROMPTER, MORE POLICY IN\nHIS SPEECHES. YOU KNOW, THERE'VE BEEN SOME\nBUMPS IN THE ROAD, FOR INSTANCE GOING DOWN TO MEXICO, HAVING\nTHAT MEETING WITH THE MEXICAN PRESIDENT, THEN COMING BACK AND\nSEEMING TO GO BACK ON THE IDEA HE WAS GOING TO SOFTEN HIS\nPOSITION ON IMMIGRATION AND IN FACT DELIVERING A HARD LINE\nPOSITION, BUT MEANWHILE, THE NEWS HAS BEEN ALMOST ALL BAD FOR\nHILLARY CLINTON FOR SEVERAL WEEKS NOW.\nMORE REVELATIONS ABOUT THE E-MAIL, THE FBI 15,000 E-MAILS\nTHEY WERE ABLE TO RECOVER, THE COZY CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION, THE STATE DEPARTMENT, NOW THE HEALTH\nSCARE. SO NOT SURPRISINGLY ALL OF THIS\nHAS LED TO HIS RISE IN THE POLLS AND HER DECLINE.\nSTILL, VERY MUCH SHE'S STILL THE FAVORITE, BUT IF HE IS AHEAD BY\nFIVE POINTS IN OHIO, THAT'S A VERY TELLING SIGN.\nTHAT IS A, YOU KNOW, THE SWINGINGEST OF SWING STATES AND\nONE THAT THE REPUBLICANS ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO HAVE.\n>> THERE IS SO MUCH GOING ON IN THIS HORSE RACE AND YOU HAVE\nINTERESTING GUESTS ON FOX NEWS SUNDAY.\nWHO DO YOU HAVE? >> TOP OFFICIALS OF BOTH THE\nTRUMP AND CLINTON COMPANIES, BUT ALSO WE'RE GOING TO TALK TO\nGEORGE CLOONEY AND JOHN PRENDERGST.\nFASCINATING INVESTIGATION THEY'VE UNDERTAKEN.\nTHE HUMAN RIGHTS IN AFRICA, THEY HAVE SET UP SOMETHING CALLED THE\nCENTURY WHICH IS UNCOVERED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THEFT AND\nCORRUPTION IN SOUTH SUDAN. THE NEWEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD\nWITH MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN THAT COUNTRY BEING CAUGHT IN THE\nCROSS FIRE. WE'LL BE TALKING GEORGE CLOONEY\nABOUT THAT AND ALSO TALK SOME POLITICS, ALL COMING UP ON FOX\nNEWS SUNDAY. >> VERY GOOD STUFF, CHRIS\nWALLACE, THANKS FOR JOINING THUS AFTERNOON, GOOD TO HAVE YOU.\n>> YOU BET.",

THEY SAY THEY'LL BE PUTTING OUT\nA DETAILED ACCOUNT OF HER HEALTH BUT THEY'VE RELEASED SOME BULLET\nPOINTS NOW. THEY SAY IN TERMS OF HER\nPNEUMONIA DIAGNOSIS LAST FRIDAY, HILLARY CLINTON HAD A\nNON-CONTRAST CHEST CT SCAN THAT WAS PERFORMED LAST FRIDAY.\nTHE RESULTS REVEALED A SMALL RIGHT MIDDLE LOBE PNEUMONIA.\nTHEY ALSO SAY THIS WAS A MILD, NON-CONTAGIOUS BACTERIAL\nPNEUMONIA. THEY SAY SECRETARY CLINTON WAS\nTREATED WITH LEVAQUIN WHICH SHE WAS ADVISED TO TAKE FOR 10 DAYS.\nSHE HAD A NORMAL BREAST ULTRASOUND AND HILLARY CLINTON\nREMAINS FIT TO SERVE FOR THE UNITED STATES.\nWE'LL HAVE THAT LETTER AS SOON AS THEY PUT THAT OUT AS WELL.\n>> THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS ABOUT THIS\nMcCAIN STANDARD FOR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES, FOR MAYBE TAKING A\nSMALL GROUP OF REPORTERS OR AN EXPERT, OPENING UP YOUR MEDICAL\nRECORDS AND HAVING A LOOK. ANY SIGN THAT WE'RE GOING\nTHROUGH SOMETHING LIKE THAT HERE?\n>> IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE THAT. BOTH CANDIDATES HAVE BEEN\nHESITANT TO PUT OUT BLANK STATEMENTS ABOUT THEIR MEDICAL\nRECORDS.

I THINK IF ANYTHING IT POINTS\nMORE TO THE VICE PRESIDENT. IF THE PRESIDENT ELECT WERE TO\nHAVE ANY KIND OF HEALTH ISSUE, VOTERS WANT TO LOOK AT THE VICE\nPRESIDENTIAL CHOICE AS WELL, AND THAT CHOICE IS OUT THERE AS WELL\nFOR VOTERS TO MAKE A DETERMINATION.\n>> IT'S ALSO ABOUT TRANSPARENCY, AND I GUESS THAT'S THE ISSUE A\nLOT OF REPORTERS HAD WHEN THIS HAPPENED ON SUNDAY WHICH WAS,\nWHY DON'T YOU TELL US EITHER WHEN YOU GET THE PNEUMONIA\nDIAGNOSIS IN THE FIRST PLACE OR TELL US WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS\nHAPPENS WHY THERE'S BEEN AN INCIDENT.\n>> RIGHT, LIMITED HISTORY GIVEN OUT OVER THE WEEKEND.\nIT WASN'T UNTIL HILLARY CLINTON'S WOBBLY MOMENT AT THE\n9/11 CEREMONY ON SUNDAY THAT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN FINALLY SAID,\nYES, SHE'S BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA.\nAFTER THAT THEY GAVE DIFFERENT  SINCE THE PNEUMONIA DIAGNOSIS,\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF, HAS BEEN VERY HANDS OFF\nIN TERMS OF HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT, I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO\nTHAT. I WISH HER WELL AND HOPE SHE CAN\nGET BACK ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. SO A DIFFERENT TACTIC HERE THAN\nYOU MIGHT EXPECT FROM THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WHICH MAY BE THINKING\nTHAT THIS STORY IS PLAYING OUT ON ITS OWN AND WE BETTER JUST\nLEAVE IT ALONE FOR NOW. >> WE'LL SEE WHAT WE FIND OUT\nFROM DONALD TRUMP WHEN HE VISITS",

AND AS WE KNOW, HILLARY CLINTON\nIS 69. THE ISSUE OF HEALTH IS REALLY\nIMPORTANT. OF COURSE, IT HAS BEEN\nHIGHLIGHTED MOST RECENTLY BY THE CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING CLINTON\nAND THE PNEUMONIA DIAGNOSIS AND TIME SHE DISCLOSED IT.\nTHAT'S WHAT PUT IT FRONT AND CENTER THIS WEEK.\nAS WE KNOW, CANDIDATES TRADITIONALLY HAVE BEEN SLIGHTLY\nMORE FORTHCOMING IN TERMS OF THEIR MEDICAL HISTORY.\nCLINTON HAS BEEN MORE FORTH COMING THAN DONALD TRUMP HAS.\nWE KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S MEDICAL HISTORY.\nREMEMBER IN 2008, JOHN McCAIN KIND OF SET THAT STANDARD OF\nRELEASING 1200 PAGES OF DOCUMENTS THAT REPORTERS --\n>> A LOT OF GOOD THAT DID JOHN McCAIN.\nRIGHT? HE HAD DOCTORS POURING OVER THE\nINFORMATION. THEY COULDN'T LEAVE A ROOM.\nTHEY CONVEYED THAT TO JOURNALISTS COVERING THE\nCAMPAIGN.

AND ONE E-MAIL I'LL READ MORE\nFULL FOR THE VIEWERS. I WOULD RATHER NOT DEVOTE FOR\nHER. AL SHOW THEIST A FRIEND.\nLONG TRACK RECORD. UNBRIDLED AMBITION.\nGREEDY. NOT TRANSFORMATIONAL.\nTHE SENTENCE CONCLUDES WITH A LEWD REFERENCE TO BILL CLINTON'S\nINFIDELITIES WHICH I'M NOT GOING READ ON NATIONAL TELEVISION.\nBUT BASICALLY ATTACKING CLINTON AND HER HUSBAND.\n>> SAY WHAT YOU WILL ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON.\nWHAT HE DID NOT DO SPECIFICALLY WAS QUESTION HER CREDIBILITY\nWITH INTERNATIONAL LEAD TERMS. HER POPULARITY.\n-- >> -- CAME WITH A DEFENSE --\n>> OR IN IN ADDITION SHE DOESN'T HAVE THIS STRANGE BROMANCE, OR\nROMANCE I GUESS IN HER CASE, WITH RUSSIA AND PUTIN IN\nGENERAL. AND THAT IS AT THE HEART OF ALL\nOF THESE LEAKS AND E-MAILS IS THE FACT THAT TRUMP IS VERY\nCLOSE WITH RUSSIA. RUSSIA STATE ACTORS ARE KNOWN TO\nTHE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY FOR HACKING GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTS.\nTRUMP THEN EGGED ON BACK IN JULY, CALLING OUT RUSSIA TO\nCONTINUE TO LEAK AND SEE WHAT YOU CAN FIND.\nAND THAT IS NOT THE STATURE OR TYPE OF BEHAVIOR WE SHOULD BE\nEXPECTING FROM A COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND NOTZ SOMETHING THAT\nCOLIN POWELL OR ANYBODY ELSE HAS EVER ACCUSED HILLARY CLINTON.\n>> ONE THING ALSO IN HERE. OF COURSE HE TOOK ISSUE WITH HER\nBLAMING HIM FOR HER E-MAIL CHOICES.\nYOU KNOW, SORT OF BLAMING THE CLINTON MAFIA WERE THE WORDS HE\nUSED. >> YOU KNOW, I THINK THERE IS A\nLOT LITTLE BIT OF CYA GOING ON HERE WITH COLIN POWELL.\nWHEN THE FIRST STORY ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON ATTACHING COLIN\nPOWELL TO THE STORY. HE DENIED IT.\nAND FEW WEEKS LATER IT TURNED OUT HE WAS MORE INVOLVED THAN HE\nADMITTED. I'M SURE HE'S TRYING TO PROTECT\nHIS LEGACY ALONG THIS STORY AS WELL BUT THE DAMMING THING TO\nME. IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT A\nREPUBLICAN WOULD SAY CRITICAL THINGS ABOUT THE DEMOCRATIC\nPRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE. WHAT IS SURPRISING IS THAT A\nREPUBLICAN, SECRETARY OF STATE OF STATE, IS CONDEMNING IN THE\nHARSHEST THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES. >> VOTED FOR OBAMA TWICE.\n>> LET ME JUST FINISH THIS. >> WELL KNOWN REPUBLICAN FIGURE.\n>> LET ME JUST FINISH THIS STATEMENT.\nWHAT WE HAVE A UNPRECEDENT. NOT A SINGLE SECRETARY OF STATE\nOR FORMER PRESIDENT ON THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WHO HAS\nENDORSED DONALD J. TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nTHAT IS A SHOCKING CONDEMNATION. >> WE HAVE MORE BREAKING NEWS\nABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S HEALTH. INCLUDING SOMETHING HE JUST SAID\nIN CANTON OHIO. A NEW CLIP HAS JUST BEEN\nRELEASED FROM DR. OZ. TRUMP IS TALKING ABOUT HIS STAM\nNASMT LET ME PLAY THAT FIRST. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT STAMINA.\nYOU HAVE USED THAT WORD A LOT. YOU MADE AN ISSUE IN THE\nCAMPAIGN. YOU ARGUE THE PRESIDENT HAS TO\nHAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF STAMINA.\nIF ELECTED AT AGE 70 YOU WILL BE THE OLDEST PERSON TO EVER ENTER\nTHE OVAL OFFICE. WHY DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE THE\nSTAMINA FOR THE JOB? >> JUST ABOUT THE SAME AGE AS\nRONALD REAGAN. AND HILLARY IS A YEAR BEHIND ME.\nI WOULD JUST SAY BASED ON MY LIFE.\nI'VE HAD -- AND ACTUALLY AND I DON'T KNOW IF THIS MAKES SENSE.\nI FEEL AS GOOD TODAY AS I DID WHEN I WAS 30.\n>> SO BETSY HE JUST SAID THAT. >> I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT.\nBECAUSE 70 IS THE NEW 50. DEVELOPMENTS IN CARDIOVASCULAR\nMEDICINE AND FITNESS MEDICINE OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS CLEARLY\nCAN BE VERIFIED THAT A 70-YEAR-OLD MAN TODAY HAS SEVEN\nYEARS MORE LIFE EXPECTANCY THAN SOMEONE IN 1970 DID.\nIN OTHER WORDS WE HAVE GAINED SO MUCH NOT JUST IN LIFE EXPECTANCY\nBY THE WAY BUT ALSO IN QUALITY OF LIFE.\nSO THAT WHEN YOU COMPARE AGE 70 WITH PREVIOUS PRESIDENT,\nESPECIALLY FROM A CENTURY AGO. >> WHICH MAY BE FAIR.\nBY THE WAY IS ACTUALLY A DEFENSE OF BOTH OF THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE\nACTUALLY ONE YEAR APART. BUT DONALD TRUMP CAME OUT A\nMOMENT AGO IN CANDIDATEN OHIO. AND HE'S BEEN VERY QUIET ABOUT\nIN THIS WEEK. BUT HE'S SPECIFICALLY TALKING\nABOUT HER STAMINA. HERE SE.\n>> I DON'T KNOW FOLKS. DO YOU THINK HILLARY WOULD BE\nABLE TO STAND UP HERE FOR AN HOUR AND DO THIS?\nI DON'T KNOW. >> OBVIOUSLY HE'S TALKING TO HIS\nSUPPORTERS THERE. BUT IS THAT APPROPRIATE IN A\nWEEK WHERE HE'S TRIED TO BE QUIET ABOUT HER HEALTH TO\nBASICALLY SAY SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STRENGTH TO STAND.\n>> -- SHE'S IN OUR PRAYERS W E WANT HER THE DGET BETTER.\nWHAT HE'S REPEATEDLY DONE LONG BEFORE THE HEALTH CONSPIRACY\nTHEORIES AND WHAT NOT GOING BACK TO LAST YEAR, HE'S CONTRASTED\nHIS WORK ETHIC WITH HER WORK ETHIC.\nHE TOOK UEFA NEARLY 14 KAYS IN -- HE'S BEEN OUT ON THE TRAIL\nFAR MORE THAN SHE HAS. >> IF YOU LOOK AT HER LONG\nHISTORY AS SECRETARY OF STATE HE'S TRAVELED FAR MORE\nINTERNATIONALLY THAN ANY PREDECESSORS, INCLUDING\nPRESIDENTS. SHE'S BEEN OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN\nTRAIL. IT IS PRIVATE MEETINGS.\nINDIVIDUAL FUNDRAISERS. SHE'S NON STOP.\nHER WORK ETHIC SHOULD NEVER BE QUESTIONED AND SECONDARILY SHE\nREVEALED FAR MORE ON HER HEALTH RECORDS, CHOLESTEROL, BLOOD\nPRESSURE THAN JUST A PIECE OF PAPER HANDED OVER TO DR. OZ.\nRIGHT NOW WE'RE EXPECTED TO TAKE DONALD TRUMP'S WORD ABOUT HIS\nOWN STAMINA AND HOW HE FEELS -- >> -- ONLY ONE WAY WE'RE GOING\nTO KNOW AND THAT IS IF TOMORROW HE ACTUALLY RELEASED THAT PAPER\nAND WE SEE WHAT'S ON IT.

YOU CAN BE PHOTOGRAPHED\nABOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE AND PEOPLE CAN LISTEN TO YOUR\nPRIVATE CONVERSATIONS WHILE YOU ARE IN YOUR HOME USING\nTECHNOLOGY. WHAT AN AWFUL SITUATION.\nENTER COLIN POWELL ONE OF THE SAVVIEST POLITICAL\nPLAYERS IN AMERICA. THE FORMER SECRETARY OF\nSTATE PLAYS BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE AND HAS SUCCEEDED\nIN DOING THAT FOR DECADES. NOW HACKERS HAVE ATTACKED\nHIM AND THE PRESIDENTIAL VOTE MAY BE AFFECTED.\nSPEAKING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP IN AN EMAIL, POWELL SAID\nTHIS QUOTE:  THERE IS NOTHING HE CAN SAY THAT WILL\nSWAY BLACK VOTERS. HE TAKES US FOR IDIOTS.\nTHE WHOLE BIRTHER MOVEMENT WAS RACIST.\nAND FOR TRUMP TO SAY YESTERDAY THAT WITHIN FOUR\nYEARS HE WOULD HAVE 9 5% OF BLACKS VOTING FOR HIM IS\nSCHIZO FANTASY, UNQUOTE. THAT SHOULD COME AS NO\nSURPRISE, COLIN POWELL HAS NEVER BEEN A FAN OF DONALD\nTRUMP. EVEN THOUGH HE IS A\nREPUBLICAN, IS HE MORE FAVORABLE TOWARDS HILLARY\nCLINTON OR SO IT SEEMED. THE HACKERS PUT THIS OUT\nTHERE, QUOTE:  SAD THING HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON COULD\nHAVE KILLED THIS TWO YEARS AGO BY MERELY TELLING\nEVERYONE HONESTLY WHAT SHE HAD DONE ABOUT THE EMAILS.\nAND NOT TIE ME INTO IT. I TOLD HER STAFF THREE TIMES\nNOT TO TRY THAT GAM BIT. I HAD TO THROW A MINI\nTANTRUM AT A PARTY TO GET THEIR ATTENTION.\nPOWELL AS YOU MAY KNOW USED PRIVATE EMAIL HIMSELF AS\nSECRETARY OF STATE BUT NOT NEARLY TO THE EXTENT\nMRS. CLINTON DID. THE GENERAL CONTINUED WITH\nANOTHER EMAIL QUOTE. BEEN HAVING FUN WITH EMAIL\nGATE. HILLARY'S MAFIA KEEPS TRYING\nTO SUCK ME IN TO IT. NOW, A GUY LIKE COLIN POWELL\nCAN BE HACKED, ANYBODY CAN THE EFFECT ON THE VOTE WILL\nPROBABLY BE MINIMAL. BUT WE CAN EXPECT MORE\nHACKING STUFF BETWEEN NOW AND ELECTION DAY.\nHACKING ASIDE, DONALD TRUMP SEEMS TO BE GAINING IN THE\nRACE RIGHT NOW. AT LEAST TWO NEW POLLS SAY\nTHAT ACCORDING TO REUTERS, HILLARY CLINTON'S SUPPORT IS\nNOW 40%, TRUMP 39% AMONG LIKELY VOTERS.\nTHE \"L.A. TIMES\" DAILY TRACKING POLL HAS IT 47% FOR\nTRUMP. 42 FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nMUST BE GOING NUT OUT THERE IN HILLARY CLINTON.\nALSO, NEW BLOOMBERG POLL HAS TRUMP UP BY 5 IN OHIO.\nAND MONMOUTH POLL OUT TODAY OF NEVADA VOTERS HAS TRUMP\nUP 44%, CLINTON 42. BACK IN JULY CLINTON WAS UP\nIN NEVADA BY 4. WHILE MID SEPTEMBER POLLS\nARE INTERESTING THE FIRST DEBATE SEPTEMBER 26TH IS\nLIKELY TO CHANGE THINGS. BOTH CANDIDATES KNOW IF THEY\nLOSE THAT DEBATE THEY COULD VERY WELL LOSE THE ELECTION.\nSUMMING UP, NO PRIVACY ON THE PLANET ANYMORE.\nCOLIN POWELL IS EMBARRASSED. THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE VERY\nTIGHT. AND THAT'S THE MEMO.\nNOW FOR THE TOP STORY, REACTION WITH US HERE IN NEW\nYORK CITY, KARL ROVE. ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT THE\nHACKING THING? I MEAN, THIS COULD CHANGE\nEVERYTHING ABOUT POLITICS. COULD IT NOT?\n>> YEAH. I MEAN, THERE ARE THINGS\nTHAT YOU CAN DO TO PROTECT AGAINST IT AND I SUSPECT\nPOLITICIANS OVER TIME WILL AVAIL THEMSELVES WITH THOSE\nTOOLS. I THINK YOUR POINT WAS\nRIGHT. IN THIS WORLD TODAY YOU\nSHOULD HAVE NO EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY BECAUSE THE\nTECHNOLOGIES EXIST TO ALLOW ORDINARY PEOPLE TO INTRUDE\nINTO EVERYBODY'S LIFE. >> THAT MAKES IT VERY, VERY\nDIFFICULT FOR ANYBODY TO EVEN HAVE A PRIVATE\nCONVERSATION. AT ALL ABOUT ANYTHING.\n>> SURE. >> SHOULD LAWS NOW, NEW LAWS\nBE PUT INTO EFFECT TO STOP ALL THIS?\n>> I DON'T KNOW. I THINK WE NEED TO BE VERY\nCAREFUL ABOUT IT THERE ARE LAWS, FOR EXAMPLE, ON\nCONVERSATIONS IN SYMPTOM STATES IT'S LEGAL TO TAPE A\nCONVERSATION WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF A PARTY TO IT\nBUT IN A LOT OF STATES IT'S ILLEGAL TO TAPE A\nCONVERSATION WITHOUT ALL PARTIES.\n>> TWO PARTIES KNOWING. >> EXACTLY.\n>> I I JUST THINK THAT THIS IS A CHILLING TIME WITH THE\nTECHNOLOGY OVERWHELMING BASIC CIVILITY.\nTHINK ABOUT IT ALMOST EVERY AREA TECHNOLOGY IS\nOVERWHELMING CIVILITY. THERE IS NO HONOR ANYMORE.\nIT'S AMAZING. WE LIVE IN AN ERA IN WHICH\nWE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT OUR PRIVACY AND SO MUCH OF WHAT\nWE DO ON FACEBOOK AND TWITTER AND SNAP CHAT AND\nINSTAGRAM IS TO GIVE UP PART OF OUR PROBLEMS.\nSOMETHING VERY INTERESTING HERE.\nAMONG TRUMP VOTERS, PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPORTING DONALD\nTRUMP, 66% SAY THEY MAINLY VOTING AGAINST HILLARY\nCLINTON.

OHIO NOW IN THIS NEW POLL IS\n48-43, A FIVE-POINT LEAD FOR DONALD TRUMP OVER HILLARY\nCLINTON. >> VERY GOOD NEWS IN THE POLL\nFOR DONALD TRUMP AND HIS CAMPAIGN.\nTHERE WAS A CBS POLL THAT HAD HILLARY CLINTON UP SEVEN POINTS.\nONE THING ABOUT THE BLOOMBERG POLL IT WAS DURING THE NEWS\nABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH SCARE.\nIT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF THE NUMBERS CONTINUE AFTER SHE\nGETS BACK ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL TOGETHER.\nALSO GOING INSIDE THE NUMBERS. THE POLL WAS VERY REPUBLICAN\nHEAVY. HAD A PLUS 7 FOR REPUBLICANS.\nINTERESTINGLY THE CBS POLL HAD A BIG DEMOCRATIC ADVANTAGE.\nMY BOTTOM LINE IS THIS IS A TOSS UP RACE.\nWHEN YOU SEE POLLING RESULTS ONE WAY OR THE OTHER, NORMALLY YOU\nSHOULD END UP CIRCLING IT AS A TOSS-UP.\nTHAT'S THE BEST DESIGNATION NOW FOR OHIO.\n>> IN FACT, I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE TRAVEL SCHEDULES UNTIL\nHILLARY CLINTON BECAME ILL WE WERE IN OHIO ONCE OR TWICE A\nWEEK THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN. THE BUS TRIP TO OHIO.\nSHE'S SO FOCUSED ON OHIO. IT'S TO TAKE AWAY A PATH TO\nVICTORY FOR DONALD TRUMP. WITHOUT OHIO, ARGUABLY WITHOUT\nPENNSYLVANIA, DONALD TRUMP REALLY DOESN'T HAVE AN EASY\nPATH. >> EXACTLY.\nWELL, IF YOU GIVE HILLARY CLINTON VIRGINIA OR COLORADO,\nDONALD TRUMP HAS TO RUN THE TABLE IN OHIO, FLORIDA,\nPENNSYLVANIA, AND NORTH CAROLINA.\nSO HE HAS TO START MOVING THE NUMBERS MORE IN HIS FAVOR.\n>> JEAN CUMMINGS, WE ARE ALSO LEARNING THAT DONALD TRUMP\nHANDED SOME RESULTS, A PAPER WITH RESULTS -- I THINK A\nONE-SHEET -- TO DR. OZ REPORTING THAT HE WAS IN EXCELLENT SHAPE.\nTHIS IS, AGAIN, FROM THE DR. BORNSTEIN EXAMINATION AND DR. OZ\nAPPARENTLY VALIDATING THAT AND SAYING IF YOU WERE MY PATIENT, I\nWOULD BE VERY HAPPY. THIS IS ON A SHOW WE HAVEN'T\nSEEN BASED ON AN EXAMINATION WITH A DOCTOR WHO HAS NOT\nINDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED ANY OF THIS EXCEPT THE INTERVIEW HE HAD\nWITH NBC NEWS A FEW WEEKS AGO. A LOT OF CAVEATS.\n>> THERE ARE A LOT OFCAVEATS. IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF\nEITHER CAMPAIGN ALLOWS THEIR DOCTOR TO TAKE QUESTIONS.\nONE THING THEY SAY HILLARY CLINTON SHOULD HAVE DONE WHEN IT\nCAME APPARENT ON SUNDAY SHE WAS SICKER THAN SHE MIGHT HAVE\nTHOUGHT, THAT IF SHE HAD LET HER DOCTOR SPEAK THEN, YOU KNOW,\nTHAT WOULD HAVE REASSURED PEOPLE IN A MORE FUNDAMENTAL WAY THAT,\nINDEED, JUST A CASE OF PNEUMONIA.\nLET'S MOVE ON. SHE'LL BE FINE.\n>> JEANNE AND MARK, THANK YOU SO MUCH.\nIT IS NOT ONLY COLIN POWELL'S E-MAILS THAT WERE HACKED BUT\nALSO A SERIES OF HIGH PROFILE CYBER ATTACKS IN THE LAST 24\nHOURS. MORE DOCUMENTS INCLUDING WHAT\nAPPEAR TO BE THE PERSONAL CELL PHONE NUMBER OF TIM KAINE WHEN\nHE WAS DNC CHAIR AND POSSIBLY TODAY.\nALSO RELEASED BY THE HACKER OR HACKERS WHO CLAIM TO HAVE BROKEN\nINTO THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE.\nANOTHER CYBER ATTACK TARGETING THE WORLD ANTI-DOPING AGENCY\nEXPOSED CONTROVERSIAL MEDICAL RECORDS OF SEVERAL STAR OLYMPIC\nATHLETES. PETE WILLIAMS JOINS ME WITH\nMORE. TO SAY NOTHING OF HOW UPSETTING\nIT IS BUT THE LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS AND THE SECURITY\nQUESTIONS. WE HAVE THAT 22 MILLION-PERSON\nHACKING INTO THE OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT OF ANYONE\nWHO HAS APPLIED FOR A JOB AND CLEARANCE BY THE FEDERAL\nGOVERNMENT. WHERE DOES IT END?\n>> Reporter: IT PROBABLY WON'T END FOR A LONG TIME.\nIF THERE IS A LESSON OUT OF THE POWELL E-MAILS IT'S NEVER ASSUME\nYOUR E-MAILS ARE PRIVATE. BUT THE CHINESE APPEAR TO BE\nBEHIND THE OPM HACK. THERE SEEMS TO BE LITTLE DOUBT\nIT WAS RUSSIAN ENTITIES BEHIND THE LATEST ATTACKS AND THE DNC\nATTACKS. THE COLIN POWELL E-MAILS CAME\nOUT ON DCLEAKS.COM WHICH MANY CYBER SECURITY EXPERTS HAVE\nCONCLUDED HAS TIES TO RUSSIAN ENTITIES.\nI SAY RUSSIAN ENTITIES BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES HAS NEVER SAID\nWHETHER IT BELIEVES THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT IS DOING THIS,\nWHETHER IT IS RUSSIAN PEOPLE ALTHOUGH THERE IS EVIDENCE IT IS\nGOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS IF YOU LOOK AT THE TIMES WHEN THE HACKS\nTAKE PLACE IT APPEARS TO BE DURING THE RUSSIAN WORK DAY.\nIN ANY EVENT THE QUESTION IS WHAT WILL THE UNITED STATES DO\nABOUT IT? WE HAVE BEEN TOLD BY SEVERAL\nOFFICIALS THERE ARE NO CRIMINAL CHARGES IMMINENT HERE.\nWE DON'T EXPECT CHARGES TO BE FILED AGAINST THE RUSSIAN\nENTITIES BUT WILL THE UNITED STATES PUBLICALLY SAY THAT THEY\nBELIEVE THE RUSSIANS ARE BEHIND IT?\nTHEY HAVE NEVER SAID IT. WILL THERE BE A SHAMING THING?\nWILL THERE BE SOME GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT EXCHANGE ABOUT THIS?\nTHAT'S THE LARGER QUESTION ABOUT WHICH THERE APPEARS TO BE NO\nANSWER NOW. >> AT THE SAME TIME, WE DO KNOW\nFROM AN INTERVIEW I DID AND FROM OTHER CONVERSATIONS THAT YOU\nHAVE HAD WITH JEH JOHNSON OF HOMELAND SECURITY SAID HE'S\nTASKING PEOPLE TO HELP WORK WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO MAKE SURE\nTHE ELECTION SYSTEM IS SAFE FROM HACKING AND FROM INTERFERENCE.\n>> THAT'S A VERY DIFFERENT QUESTION.\nOF COURSE IT APPEARS TO BE THAT THE GENERAL BELIEF IS THAT THE\nHACKS ARE INTENDED TO UNDERCUT CONFIDENCE IN THE U.S.\nELECTIONS. BUT THE SAME OFFICIALS SAY THEY\nDOUBT THE RUSSIAN ENTITIES COULD HAVE ANY EFFECT ON THE ACTUAL\nVOTE COUNT. >> PETE WILLIAMS, THANK YOU VERY\nMUCH. THANKS FOR BEING WITH US.\nMORE AHEAD ON \"ANDREA MITCHELL REPORTS.\" >>> THAT DOES IT FOR A BUSY\nEDITION OF \"ANDREA MITCHELL REPORTS.\"\nTHANKS FOR BEING WITH US. TUNE IN TONIGHT FOR THE 11th\nHOUR WITH BRIAN WILLIAMS.

THIS HOUR.\nFOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE NEW INFORMATION ON DONALD TRUMP'S\nMEDICAL STATUS. INFORMATION HE'S REVEALED IT ON\nTHE DR. OZ SHOW AFTER A BACK AND FORTH AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THAT\nWOULD HAPPEN. WE DIG INTO THE DETAILS COMING\nUP. PLUS THIS HOUR, ONE OF OUR\nREPORTERS IS TALKING WITH NEW YORK'S ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO\nLAUNCHED AN INQUIRY INTO TRUMP'S NONPROFIT.\nTHE NOMINEE'S BUSINESS DEALINGS UNDER A MICROSCOPE TODAY.\nA NATIONAL DISGRACE, THAT'S HOW FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE COLIN\nPOWELL DESCRIBED DONALD TRUMP IN A SERIES OF LEAKED E-MAILS.\nHE ALSO HAD STRONG WORDS ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHE FOUR-STAR GENERAL TELLS NBC NEWS THE HACKERS HAVE A LOT\nMORE. WE HAVE IT COVERED FROM THE TEAM\nOF REPORTERS ON THE GROUND. I WANT TO START NOW WITH NBC'S\nPETER ALEXANDER JOINING ME NOW.

MARIS, I'LL START WITH YOU. ONE OF THE FUNDS YOU RUN IS THE\nGLOBAL ALPHA EQUITY STRATEGY. SO YOU'RE COMMITTED TO\nDELIVERING ALPHA. PEOPLE SOUNDED FEARFUL YESTERDAY\nTHAT THE END OF THE CREDIT CYCLE WAS APPROACHING AN END.\nARE YOU AS WORRIED AS THEY ARE? >> YOU KNOW, I'M NOT REALLY.\nI THINK THERE IS A CROWDED TRADE THAT IS OUT THERE, IT IS IN THIS\nLOW VOLATILITY SAFETY TRADE AND YOU SEE AN INCREDIBLE RUSH OF\nCAPITAL TO THIS. AND WHAT THAT HAS MEANT IS THAT\nSTOCKS AREN'T BEING PRICED FOR GROWTH.\nYOU KNOW, THERE IS GROWTH, WHERE IT IS OPEN ENDED AND SECULAR.\nAT THE SAME TIME, YOU'VE GOT STOCKS THAT ARE REFLECTING\nDISTRESS ASSET PRICES. WHEN THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE\nDRAMATICALLY BETTER. FOR MY VIEW, WE'RE FINDING GREAT\nOPPORTUNITIES BOTH IN GREAT SECULAR GROWTH STORIES AROUND\nTHE WORLD, AS WELL AS REALLY INTERESTING DEEP VALUE STOCKS\nTHAT ARE -- WHERE THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY\nBETTER THAN THE SHARE PRICES REFLECT.\n>> BREXIT, NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES, POPULISM, THE RISE OF THE\nRIGHT WING, WE GOT ALL THESE THINGS, GEORGE THAT HAVE NEVER\nHAPPENED BEFORE. IS THERE ANY HISTORICAL GUIDE?\nCAN YOU LOOK BACK AT ANY TEXTBOOK AND SAY THIS IS WHAT I\nSHOULD DO NOW? >> NO.\nSO I THINK THAT'S WHAT HAS GOT EVERYONE SO UNEASY.\nALL OF THESE THINGS PUT US IN A PLACE WE HAVE NEVER BEEN BEFORE,\nTHAT'S WHAT CREATED THIS ANXIETY.\n>> HERE IS WHAT I FOUND INTERESTING, ESPECIALLY BILL\nMILLER SAID LONG THE S&P, SHORT THE TEN-YEAR TREASURY, HE SAID\nTHE TEN-YEAR WAS SO OVERVALUED, IT REMINDED HIM OF STOCKS IN\nSEPTEMBER OF 1987, JUST BEFORE THE CRASH.\nIT WAS THAT -- SO HUGE. HERE IS WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.\nIF YOU THINK BONDS ARE IN A BUBBLE, INTEREST RATES ARE GOING\nTO RISE. ISN'T THAT GOING TO BE BAD FOR\nSTOCKS. >> THAT'S THE HISTORICAL PLAY\nBOOK. IF WE WERE PLAYING OFF\nHISTORICAL PARADIGM, THAT'S WHAT WOULD HAPPEN.\nTHAT'S NOT THE CASE NOW. THE REASON RATES ARE SO LOW IS\nBECAUSE THERE ARE ALL THESE CONCERNS ABOUT NO GROWTH IN THE\nENVIRONMENT, NO INFLATION. IF WE GET RATES GOING UP, IT IS\nA SIGN OF GROWTH, A SIGN OF INFLATION.\nTHAT'S ACTUALLY VERY HEALTHY FOR EQUITIES.\n>> IF YOU LOOK, JACK, I'LL BRING YOU IN HERE ON THIS\nCONVERSATION, YOU KNOW, THIS NOTION THAT PEOPLE ARE LOOK FOR\nYIELD, RIGHT, THAT'S WHY PEOPLE WENT INTO DIVIDEND YIELDING\nSTOCKS, LOOK AT THE SECTORS IN THE S&P 500, EIGHT OF THE TEN\nARE YIELDING HIGHER THAN THE TEN-YEAR YIELD.\nSO WHEN YIELDS GO UP, THERE IS GOING TO BE THIS RUSH OF MONEY.\nGEORGE HAD MENTIONED THE LOW VOLATILITY FUNDS.\nTHOSE ARE THE FUNDS IN THIS PARTICULAR TRADE.\nAREN'T THINGS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THIS TIME IN TERMS OF WHAT HAS\nGOTTEN US HERE AS PEOPLE SEARCH FOR YIELD AND PUSH THE\nVALUATIONS HIGHER ON THESE SECTORS LIKE UTILITIES AND\nTELECOMS AND STAPLES? >> I THINK IT IS A CONSEQUENCE\nOF, YOU KNOW, WE HANDED OFF TO THE CENTRAL BANKS TO SAY, HERE,\nFIX IT, WE GOT LOW GROWTH AND WANT HIGHER GROWTH.\nAND, YOU KNOW, IN MANY RESPECTS, JUST LIKE PUTTING SAND IN THE\nSHORE AND GETTING STYMIED WHEN THE TIDE COMES BACK IN.\nI THINK WHAT IT HAS DONE HAS CERTAINLY CREATED A WEDGE\nBETWEEN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND THE -- AND MAINSTREAM.\nAND SO AS A RESULT OF THAT, INVESTORS ARE LOOKING FOR\nYIELD -- WILLING TO TAKE MORE RISKS THAT THEY'RE ACCUSTOMED TO\nTAKING. WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND, ANY\nCRISIS THAT RESULTS FROM THIS IS REALLY A CONTRIVED CRISIS.\nTHIS ISN'T A METEOR COMING OUT OF OUTER SPACE AND HITTING THE\nEARTH THAT WE CAN'T GET OUT IN FRONT OF.\nTHIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN CREATED BY THE CENTRAL BANKS AND\nWE HAVE TO WORK OUR WAY OUT. I DON'T THINK THIS IS\nNECESSARILY THE NEXT, YOU KNOW, CRISIS THAT IS GOING TO CREATE A\nHUGE CRATER. >> ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT I\nHEARD YESTERDAY AND I BELIEVE IT WAS PAUL SINGER WHO MADE IT AND\nALSO MR. DALIO WHO MADE IT AND THAT WAS THAT WHAT THE CENTRAL\nBANKS HAVE DONE IS TRY TO CREATE GROWTH BY KEEPING INTEREST RATES\nLOW. IT HASN'T WORKED OR ARGUABLE\nTHEY HAVE CREATED GROWTH. BUT IT IS NOT ARGUABLE THAT THEY\nHAVE NOT SUPPORTED THE PRICES OF ASSETS, BONDS AND STOCKS.\nAND IF THOSE -- IF THEY STOP DOING THAT, WHAT DOES THAT SAY\nABOUT THE VALUES OF STOCKS AND BONDS?\n>> PERFECT, I AGREE. STOCKS AND BONDS ARE EXPENSIVE.\nTHERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. THE FACT IS THAT McDONALD'S WAS\nABLE TO ISSUE A TEN-YEAR NOTE IN EUROPE AT 0.75% A FEW MONTHS\nAGO. I CAN ASSURE YOU, NO -- GIVEN\nTHAT McDONALD'S BONDS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE TRADING AT NEARLY 3%\nFOR THE SAME MATURITY, WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO BUY A McDONALD'S\nBOND AT 0.75%, BECAUSE THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK IS BUYING\nIT ALL. INVESTORS AREN'T BUYING THAT.\nAND McDONALD'S IS TAKING THAT MONEY BACK HERE AND BUYING BACK\nTHEIR OWN SHARES. SO THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT\nCENTRAL BANKS RUNNING INTERFERENCE AND CREATING HIGH VALUATIONS, BUT THE FACT IS,\nTHEY'RE NOT GOING TO NECESSARILY TURN OFF THE SPIGOT AND RUN\nAWAY. THEY RECOGNIZE THAT, YOU KNOW,\nTHERE IS AN ADDICTION HERE, AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SLOWLY\nGET OFF OF THIS LIQUIDITY, BUT DO IT IN A GRADUAL WAY.\n>> MICHELLE HAD MENTIONED GOING LONG STOCKS, AND SHORT G-7\nBONDS, BUT WHEN THIS -- WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT STOPS, WHEN\nTHE MERRY-GO-ROUND STOPS, WON'T ALL ASSET CLASSES GO DOWN?\nTHERE IS A BANK OF AMERICA, MERRILL LYNCH FUND SURVEY\nRELEASED YESTERDAY, 54% OF FUND MANAGERS SAY BOTH STOCKS AND\nBONDS ARE OVERVALUED AT THIS POINT.\nAND WE'RE JUST LAYING OUT, YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE LOW\nVOLATILITY FUNDS, PUSHING UP THE VALUATIONS.\nTHERE IS THIS THOUGHT THERE IS NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE ESSENTIALLY\nPUSHING THAT TRADE HIGHER. HOW IS IT GOING TO END?\nARE WE GOING TO SEE A REVERSION WHERE WE HAVE THAT BREAK IN\nCORRELATION? >> I THINK YOU CAN HAVE, YOU\nKNOW, SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN FIXED INCOME MARKETS AND EQUITY\nMARKETS AND HAVE EQUITY SECTORS DO VERY WELL.\nYOU HARKEN BACK TO THE YEAR 2000, WHEN THE MARKETS WERE TO\nBE KIND A DISASTER, FINANCIALS WERE UP 50% THAT YEAR.\nSO YOU CAN HAVE SECTORS THAT HAVE BEEN OVERSOLD OR\nUNDERAPPRECIATED DO EXTREMELY WELL IN A DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT.\nYOU TALK ABOUT EQUITY MARKETS OVERVALUED, 17 TIMES EARNINGS\nFOR THE S&P 500, HISTORICALLY THAT'S VERY, VERY HIGH.\nIT IS NOT HIGH RELATIVE TO FIXED INCOME AT THIS CURRENT TIME.\nAND AT THE SAME TOKEN, THERE IS SECTORS WITHIN THE S&P 500 THAT\nARE EXTRAORDINARILY CHEAP. YOU CAN LOOK AT FINANCIALS THAT\nARE TRADING DISTRESS BUT AREN'T. OR LOOK AT CHINESE INTERNET\nPLAYS. ALIBABA TRADES AT THE SAME\nMULTIPLE AS THE REGULATED U.S. UTILITY, THAT DOESN'T MAKE\nSENSE. SO YOU CAN SEE THIS UNWIND OF\nTHE SAFETY, THIS LOW VOLATILITY TRADE, CREATING TREMENDOUS\nOPPORTUNITIES IF YOU'RE ACTIVE. >> JAY JACK, YESTERDAY, MAY NOT\nHAVE SEEMED LIKE SOME SORT OF A RED LETTER DAY, BUT TO ME AND\nSOME OTHERS, VERY INTERESTING MOVES BECAUSE IT DOESN'T GET A\nLOT OF ATTENTION, NOT SEXY, DOESN'T SCREAM AT YOU, THE\nTEN-YEAR YIELD ROSE BY 3%, THE S&P FELL BY 1%, A VERY RARE DIVERSION.\nDID YESTERDAY ESTABLISH SOMETHING NEW?\n>> I DO THINK THAT FAIR VALUE FOR THE TEN-YEAR TREASURY IS\nHIGHER IN YIELD THAN WHERE IT IS RIGHT NOW.\nIF YOU LOOK AT NOMINAL GDP, WHICH IS RELATIVELY LOW, THAT'S\nAT 2.7%, NOT 1.7%. THAT'S HISTORICALLY BEEN A\nPRETTY GOOD PROXY FOR WHERE THE TEN-YEAR TREASURY OUGHT TO BE.\nSO, YEAH, I WOULD SAY WE COULD GET 100 BASIS POINT RISE OUT OF\nTHE TEN-YEAR TREASURY AND THAT IT WILL CERTAINLY CREATE SOME\nDISRUPTION. BUT, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT\nSUGGESTING THAT -- OR I DON'T THINK ANYONE IS SUGGESTING THAT\nFAIR VALUE FOR THE TEN-YEAR IS 3.5% OR 4% OR SOMETHING LIKE\nTHAT. >> GEORGE MARIS, JACK, THANK YOU\nBOTH VERY MUCH. APPRECIATE IT.\n>> PLEASURE, THANKS. >> IF YOU ARE IN PITTSBURGH AND\nYOU HAIL AN UBER TODAY, IT COULD ARRIVE WITHOUT A DRIVER.\nTHE QUESTION IS, WOULD YOU STILL GET IN?\nTHE COMPANY TESTING OUT ITS AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE PROGRAM.\nWE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE DETAILS. >>> AND MAKING THE CASE TO BUY\nVALEANT STOCK, A BOLD CALL FROM ONE OF THE MOST LEGENDARY STOCK\nINVESTORS.",

IT WAS PRETTY MUCH IDENTICAL\nSPEECHES. AND WHAT THAT TOLD ME IS THEY'RE\nBEGINNING TO COME AROUND TO KIND OF A NEW WAY OF THINKING ABOUT\nTHE WORLD WHICH IS ACTUALLY VERY SIMILAR TO THE OLD WAY OF\nTHINKING ABOUT THE WORLD AND SO MAYBE WE'RE MOVING BACK INTO A\nPERIOD WHERE WE'LL BE ABLE TO PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY.\n>> SO THE BOND MARKET PREDICTS THEY ACTUALLY RAISE RATES NEXT\nWEEK?

NEXT I LOOK AT HOUSING.\nHOUSING DEMAND REMAINS STRONG IN THIS COUNTRY.\nWE'RE TALKING TO TOLL BROTHERS LATER TONIGHT AND THEIR VIEW IS\nPRETTY POSITIVE ON THAT LATEST CONFERENCE CALL.\nWHEN HOUSING IS ROBUST, THAT MEANS SPENDING TO FIX UP A HOUSE\nIS STRONG, AND THAT'S A MAJOR PIECE OF OUR HUGE RETAIL\nECONOMY. HOW ABOUT NON-REALLY\nCONSTRUCTION? BIG CHUNK.\nBIG CHUNK OF THE BUSINESS. I SPEAK TO SEVERAL COMPANIES IN\nEVERY SILO OF NON-REALLY FROM THE CONSTRUCTION LOANS IN ALL\nGEOGRAPHIES TO THE MATERIALS NEEDED TO ERECT BUILDINGS TO THE\nFIXTURES, HEATING, AIR-CONDITIONING, LIGHTING,\nVENTILATION COMPANIES. MY JUDGMENT?\nTHINGS ARE PRETTY GOOD. WHILE I DON'T LIKE THE\nAUTOMOBILE STOCKS BECAUSE THE WORLDWIDE ENTERPRISE ISN'T AS\nHEALTHY AS I'D LIKE AS I JUST SAID, THE DEMAND IN THE U.S. IS\nSTRONG WITH SUVs AND TRUCKS SELLING VERY WELL.\nAEROSPACE, STRONG OUT OF BOEING TODAY.\nAT THE ACTUAL STORE LEVEL, IT IS MIXED, NOT TERRIBLE.\nCASUAL DINING IS NOT GOOD. LOOK AT CRACKER BARREL DOWN $10\nTODAY. BUT SOME OF THAT IS BECAUSE IT'S\nJUST A LOT CHEAPER TO STAY HOME THANKS TO THE DECLINE IN THE\nPRICE OF FOOD MENTIONED ON THE CRACKER BARREL CALL.\nI BELIEVE THERE'S ALSO BEEN A TAMPING OF DEMAND FROM INCREASED\nHEALTH CARE BILLS. RETAILERS, HIT OR MISS.\nWE SEE STRENGTH OF WALMART AND AMAZON WHICH ARE A HUGE PART OF\nTHE RETAIL EQUATION. DEPARTMENT STORES, NOT GREAT ALL\nWE WE HAD A KEY UP GRADE AT MACY'S TODAY.\nBACK TO SCHOOL, NOT BAD AT ALL. GO --\nAND THEN THERE'S PERHAPS THE MOST OVERLOOKED GAUGE OF DEMAND\nIN THIS COUNTRY, AND THAT'S THE HUGE AND, YES, ENTIRELY\nUNEXPECTED INCREASE IN ORDERS FOR APPLE'S SUPPOSEDLY BLAH\niPHONE 7. WHEN YOU HAVE SPRINT AND\nT-MOBILE SAYING THEY HAVE OFF THE CHART DEMANDS FOR THE PHONE,\nWHEN AT&T TELLS US TODAY THAT DEMAND IS BETTER THAN EXPECTED\nAND VERIZON SAYS IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE PREDICTIONS CEO LOWELL\nMcADAM MADE ON THIS SHOW, THAT THE iPHONE IS INDEED SELLING\nVERY WELL, THEN IT'S AN ACTUAL NEEDLE MOVER.\nHENCE THE TERRIFIC RUN IN APPLE STOCK.\nTHE SESSION'S LEADER. WE KNOW THAT MILLENNIALS NOW\nREPRESENT ABOUT HALF THE CONSUMER DEMAND IN THIS COUNTRY\nAND THEY SPEND ON WAY DIFFERENT THINGS THAN OTHER GENERATIONS\nINCLUDING MY OWN. THEY LIKE EXPERIENCES.\nTHEY LIKE GAMES. WHAT CAN YOU PLAY THE MOST\nHIGH-POWERED GAMES ON? THE iPHONE 7.\nHOW DO YOU SHARE YOUR EXPENSES BEST?\nWITH BEAUTIFUL PICTURES TAKEN ON YOUR BRAND-NEW iPHONE.\nYOU HAVE A BILLION iPHONE USERS AND THEY'RE WILLING TO SPEND\nHUNDREDS OF DOLLARS ON THEIR PHONES, THESE NEW ONES THAT THEY\nOTHERWISE WOULD SPEND ON SOMETHING ELSE BECAUSE THEY WANT\nTHE PROCESSING POWER. THEY WANT THE SPEED.\nTHAT'S PURE DEMAND. NOW, I KNOW THAT MY MOSAIC SEEMS\nNOTHING BUT A SERIES OF ANECDOTES.\nWE WANT SOMEONE FROM A -- WE WANT A COMMERCE DEPARTMENT\nNUMBER TO CAPTURE WHAT I JUST PUT TOGETHER.\nWE WANT SOME GRAND INQUISITOR TO ASK QUESTIONS AND MAKE SENSE OF\nEVERYTHING AND THEN MIND MELD IT WITH AN ALGORITHM THAT SHOWS US\nWHAT THE ECONOMY WILL DO GIVEN THAT SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES.\nTHAT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN. YOU'RE STUCK WITH MY ANECDOTES.\nHERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE, THOUGH. THE PLURAL OF ANECDOTE IS DATA,\nAND BASED ON THE DATA, I THINK WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH DEMAND TO\nKEEP THE MARKET FROM GOING LOWER.\nBUT WE DO HAVE ENOUGH DEMAND TO CONTAIN THE DECLINE TO LEVELS\nTHAT AREN'T DANGEROUS. THAT'S WHY I KEEP TELLING YOU TO\nSTAY THE COURSE, BECAUSE IT WILL ULTIMATELY BE TOO HARD TO GET\nOUT AND THEN GET BACK IN AT LOWER LEVELS.\nDEPESH IN TENNESSEE, DEPESH? >> Caller: YES, MR. CRAMER.\nTHANKS FOR TAKING MY CALL. I HAVE A QUICK QUESTION ABOUT\nMONSANTO.  TRADING AT 106 AND 107.\nIS THE RIGHT TIME TO BUY? >> NO, I DON'T WANT TO BUY\nBECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE THE DEAL IS GOING TO GO THROUGH.\nI THINK THE FARMERS WILL FIGHT IT, AND THE COMPANIES THEMSELVES\nMAY BE MISJUDGING THE OPPOSITION BY THE FARMERS.\nMIKE IN MONTANA, MIKE. >> Caller: THANKS FOR TAKING MY\nCALL. >> OF COURSE.\n>> Caller: I'M AN INVESTOR IN MET LIFE, AND THEY ARE SEEKING\nTO EXIT A U.S. RETAIL UNIT. THEY WANT TO DO IT BY SPINOFF OR\nAN IPO. WHAT WOULD BE THE EFFECT OF THE\nSTOCK IF THEY DO? >> I THINK IT'S BAKED INTO THE\nSTOCK AND YOU'VE GOT A 3.65% YIELD.\nIT'S JUST AN OKAY INSURER. IT'S NOT FABULOUS.\nWHAT CAN I SAY? THAT'S MY JUDGMENT.\nJERRY IN ARIZONA. JERRY.\n>> Caller: MR. CRAMER, STOCK SYMBOL, AMBA HAD EARNINGS LAST\nWEEK AND AFTERWARDS IT GOT HIT HARD.\nAT THIS POINT WOULD YOU CONSIDER THIS A BUY, SELL OR HOLD.\n>> I WAS ON THE -- LOOK, THE BUSINESS IS GOOD, BUT THE\nSTOCK'S VERY EXPENSIVE. I DON'T WANT TO OWN AMBRELLA\nSTOCK. I'VE GOT TOO MANY HIGH QUALITY\nSTOCKS THAT ARE N THE SEMICONDUCTORS BUSINESS THAT I\nTHINK ARE DOING TERRIFIC STUFF, ALL THIS DRONE STUFF.\nIT'S TOO HOT FOR THIS GUY. ME NO LIKE HOT.\nALL RIGHT. THERE'S NO GLOBAL DEMAND NUMBER.\nNO HERE'S WHERE THE WORLD ECONOMY IS HEADED ALGORITHM.\nYOU GOT TO FIND THE CLUES, FIGURE OUT THE ANSWERS AND RIGHT\nNOW THINGS DON'T LOOK GREAT. BUT THEY'RE FAR FROM BAD ENOUGH\nTO HAVE ME TELLING YOU TO RUN FOR THE HILLS.\nI SAY STAY THE COURSE. TONIGHT, THE POLITICAL RHETORIC\nAGAINST DRUG PRICES HAS BEEN TOUGH.\nAN INVESTMENT IN ONE MAJOR DRUG COMPANY.\nNO, NOT YET. BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHICH PLAY I\nTHINK LOOKS COMPELLING JUST AHEAD.\n>>> THEN IT MAY BE FASHION WEEK IN NEW YORK CITY, BUT THE\nRETAILS HAVEN'T BEEN EN VOGUE ON",

              "text": "AND WHAT'S THE PRICE TO\nINNOVATION. AND PRICE CONTROLS HAVE NEVER\nWORKED. NOBODY IN THE WORLD HAS OUR\nINNOVATION ECOSYSTEM. SO I'D BE VERY, VERY CONCERNED\nIF THERE WERE ANY HEAVY HANDED MOVES TO TRY TO CHANGE THE KEY\nELEMENTS OF WHAT I'D CALL THE INNOVATION ECOSYSTEM WHICH\nAPPLIES TO MORE THAN BIOPHARMACEUTICALS.\nI THINK THE HEART OF AMERICAN COMPETITIVENESS.\n>> AND I'VE WATCHED AMGEN ALL THE WAY THROUGH FROM THE -- I\nREMEMBER WHEN I WAS A STOCKBROKER WHEN IT PUBLISHED.\nI REMEMBER AMGEN IS THE ENVY OF THE WORLD IN THE WAY IT'S\nBEEN -- IT CAME FROM NOTHING, THE WAY IT'S OPERATED.\nHERE'S THE ARGUMENT THAT CAN BE MADE, KEVIN.\nAND THAT IS I WATCHED AMGEN GO FROM $1 A SHARE TO PROBABLY\n$2,000. YOU AS A CEO AND AS A COMPANY,\nYOU FOUGHT TOOTH AND NAIL TO KEEP OUT COMPETITORS.\nAND YOU WERE JUSTIFIED IN DOING SO, OBVIOUSLY.\nBUT THE MARKET CAP GAINS WERE, SOME WOULD SAY, ON THE LEFT AT\nTHE EXPENSE OF THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM.\nAND THEY DIDN'T NEED TO HAVE 50%, 70% MARGINS IF THERE HAD\nBEEN COMPETITION THE ENTIRE TIME.\nMAYBE AMGEN WOULDN'T HAVE GONE FROM $1 TO $2,000 BUT MAYBE THE\nCOST INFLATION OF THE ENTIRE HEALTH CARE WOULD HAVE BEEN KEPT\nLOWER. >> I HAVE A DIFFERENT POINT OF\nVIEW, OF COURSE. WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT NUPOGEN\nCONTINUES TO PROVIDE ENORMOUS VALUE TO PATIENTS.\nAMGEN LED THE TALK IN THE BIO -- >> YOU'RE PREACHING TO THE\nCHOIR. I UNDERSTAND THAT.\nYOU SEE THE POINT I'M MAKING. I APPRECIATE THAT.\n>> AND THE MONEY FROM NUPOGEN AND EPOGEN WENT TO FUND OVER\nTIME WHICH HAVE RESULTED IN ANY NUMBER OF AND WE DON'T HAVE TIME\nTODAY. I COULD GO THROUGH THEM.\nBREAKTHROUGH MEDICINES. I THINK THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\nGOT A GOOD VALUE FOR WHAT THEY PAID.\nTHE SOCIAL CONTRACT IS HIGH MARGINS, HIGH INNOVATION, TAKE\nHIGH RISK. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES\nTO INNOVATE. >> BUT PEOPLE LOOKING FOR PURE\nCOMPETITION DON'T SEE IT. AND THIS IS THE ROAD I'M JUST\nSAYING. YOU'RE PREACHING TO THE CHOIR\nHERE. I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING YOU SAID\nABOUT AMGEN. IT'S THE APPLE OF OUR EYE IN\nTHIS COUNTRY IN TERMS OF INNOVATION.\nBUT THAT'S GOING TO BE THE ARGUMENT.\nTHAT THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED A FAIR PRICE THAT ISN'T REFLECTED\nWHEN YOU HAVE 17-YEAR PATENT PROTECTION AND THE COMPANY\nBENEFITS -- AND ALSO, KEVIN. YOU LOOK AT THE PHARMACEUTICAL\nINDUSTRY. THEY GET A PATENT THEN DO\nEXTENDED RELEASE. SPEND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF\nDOLLARS TO GET NEW PATENT PROTECTION TO EXTEND IT.\n>> I'M NOT GOING TO DEFEND EVERY SINGLE THING THAT EVERY COMPANY\nDOES TO IN SOME CASES GAIN THE PATENT SYSTEM.\nWE COULD PROBABLY AGREE ON SOME OF THE DETAILS.\nBUT I THINK IN THE MAIN, A STRONG PATENT PROTECTION SYSTEM\nIS CENTRAL TO THE SYSTEM. AND AMGEN WAS CENTRALLY INVOLVED\nIN TRYING TO STRENGTHEN THE PATENT LAW AND I'M PROUD OF WHAT\nWE DID. THE TECH INDUSTRY WANTED TO\nWEAKEN PATENTS AND WE THOUGHT THAT PATENTS REALLY, REALLY\nMATTERED. AND IN COUNTRIES THAT DON'T HAVE\nPATENTS, INNOVATION DOESN'T HAPPEN.\n>> ZERO. >> IS IT PERFECT?\nNO, IT'S NOT PERFECT. BUT IN THE MAIN, I THINK THE\nEXPERIENCE OF AMGEN AND OTHER COMPANIES IS THAT THE MONEY THAT\nWE MAKE ON THE WINNERS FUNDS RND AND IT'S A RISKY BUSINESS.\nTHE WHOLE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY HAS BEEN WORKING FOR 19\nYEARS TO TRY TO CURE ALZHEIMER'S AND THAT'S EXPENSIVE.\nTHAT'S WHERE THE CURE'S GOING TO COME FROM.\nI THINK IT'S A MATTER OF DEGREE, NOT A MATTER OF FUNDAMENTALS.\n>> KEVIN, IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. I NOTICED THE OTHER DAY --\n>> GOOD TO SEE YOU. >> -- THE CEO OF ALLERGAN\nOPPOSED A PRICE CEILING ON HIS PRODUCTS.\nAND THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY WELL ACCEPTED POLITICALLY.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT IN TERMS OF THE HEALTH OF THE\nINDUSTRY? OF THE INDUSTRY?\n>> WELL, I THINK, LARRY, THAT THERE'S DANGER IN THAT.\nWE HAVE SOME BIOPHARMACEUTICAL DRUGS THAT ARE PRICED AT\nASTRONOMICAL LEVELS TO TREAT VERY, VERY SMALL POPULATIONS, AS\nMUCH AS $250,000 A YEAR FOR SEVERAL THOUSAND PEOPLE\nPOPULATIONS. AND THAT'S A GOOD BARGAIN,\nBECAUSE IT DOESN'T COST THE SYSTEM MUCH AND THOSE PEOPLE\nOTHERWISE WOULDN'T BE HELPED. I THINK THERE ARE REAL ISSUES IN\nSOME OF THE CANCER THERAPIES THAT ARE $100,000 A YEAR THAT\nPROVIDE WHAT I WOULD CALL INVEST MARGINAL BENEFIT.\nWHEN I WAS IN THE SEAT, I USED TO THINK THE SPEED OF SOUND WAS\nA SIX-FIGURE ANNUAL PRICE. SO I DON'T LIKE PRICE CONTROLS\nIN ANY FORM. BUT I THINK THE DIALOGUE WE'RE\nHAVING NATIONALLY, AND FRANKLY, SHAMING COMPANIES WHICH SHOULD\nBE SHAMED LIKE MYLAN FOR WHAT THEY DID, IS A GOOD WAY TO\nDISCIPLINE PEOPLE. AND I THINK THE FREE MARKET AND\nOUR NOISY DEMOCRACY IS THE BEST WAY TO DO IT.\n>> KEVIN, I'M ANYTHING BUT YOUR BOSS.\nBUT I WAS HONORED BY THAT STATEMENT.\nI THINK, YOU KNOW, IF WE STEP BACK, OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN\nTERMS OF THE VALUE COST BENEFIT IS ACTUALLY A COMPETITIVE\nWEAKNESS OF THE UNITED STATES. IT SHOWS UP IN ALL OUR SURVEYS.\nIT'S JUST VERY, VERY EXPENSIVE. IT CREATES THE HIGH COST OF\nDOING BUSINESS IN THE U.S. SO I THINK YOU AND I, WE WOULD\nALL AGREE IF WE CAN BRING DOWN THAT COST AND STILL INNOVATE AND\nDELIVER GREAT VALUE TO THE PATIENTS, THAT'S A GOOD THING.\nAND I THINK PART OF THAT IS COMPETITION IN THE PHARMA\nINDUSTRY. BUT PART OF IT IS FOR THE\nDELIVERY SYSTEM TO RAISE THE BAR, TO BETTER MEASURE OUTCOMES,\nTO UNDERSTAND, YOU KNOW, WHICH DRUGS REALLY WORK AND WORK THE\nBEST WAY. >> I COMPLETELY AGREE, MIKE.\nI THINK AS YOU AND I HAVE WORKED ON THIS TOGETHER THAT FIRST FACT\nIS THE BIOPHARMACEUTICAL PART OF THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS 10%,\nTHAT'S THE 10% OF THE TOTAL COST.\nSO IF WE'RE GOING AFTER THE 17% OF GDP THAT THE HEALTH CARE\nSYSTEM REPRESENTS, IT'S GOT TO BE WHERE THE DOLLARS ARE.\nAND WE'VE GOT TO SHIFT FROM WHAT I CALL A TONNAGE SYSTEM, PAY FOR\nACTIVITY, TO A VALUE SYSTEM WHICH MEANS PAY FOR RESULTS AND\nOUTCOMES. AND I THINK THAT GOES ACROSS THE\nSPECTRUM. I THINK WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN\nOVER TIME IS EVEN IN DRUGS SAFETY AND EFFICACY ARE NOT\nGOING TO BE ENOUGH. THEY'RE GOING TO BE TABLE STAKES\nVALUE. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET INTO\nTHE IDEA OF VALUE. IT'S A COMPLEX SUBJECT, BUT\nWE'VE GOT TO GET THERE. I THINK THE OTHER THING IS THAT\nRICH SHIFTING TO PROVIDERS IS GOING TO HAVE TO HAPPEN TOO.\nALL THESE THINGS ARE HAPPENING NOW.\nIT'S JUST SLOW AND COMPLEX. BUT I THINK THAT'S WHERE IT\nGOES. PAY FOR VALUE.\nAND I THINK IT'S RISK SHARING. >> KEVIN, THANK YOU FOR YOUR\nTIME TODAY. WE APPRECIATE IT.\nUP NEXT, WE HAVE JIM CRAMER ON TODAY'S TOP STORIES.        Do I look smarter?         Yeah, a little. JIM CRAMER JOINS US NOW.\nWE'VE HAD A LITTLE MORE TO WATCH OVER THE PAST WEEK ANYWAY, JIM,\nRIGHT? >> YEAH, LOOK, WE'VE GOT SOME\nOTHER FACTORS. I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS PEOPLE\nARE NOT FOCUSED ON ENOUGH IS WHAT DOES APPLE'S SELLING OF ITS\n7 MEAN FOR THE ACTUAL DEMAND. PEOPLE HAVE TO REMEMBER PEOPLE\nBUY A LOT OF STUFF ON AMAZON AND THIS IS A HUGELY EXPENSIVE\nPHONE. AND PEOPLE MAY THINK AUGUST\nSALES WERE BAD, AND I UNDERSTAND THAT.\nSTEVE LIESMAN IS RIGHT, AUGUST WAS WEAK.\nBUT WHEN I LOOK AT THESE NUMBERS, LOOK WHAT PEOPLE SPEND\nON, I DON'T THINK THIS IS A TRADITION LIKE BUYING SHIRTS AT\nMACY'S. THIS IS A NEW WAY TO SPEND AND\nPEOPLE HAVE A LOT MORE MONEY THAN -- DISPOSABLE INCOME\nBECAUSE THESE PHONES ARE  >> SO ARE WE GOING TO HAVE TO DO\nONE OF THOSE OCTOBER SELLOFF, LOWS THINGS OR ARE WE GOING TO\nAVOID IT? >> I KIND OF THINK WE HAVE TO.\nWHETHER IT BE THE FED OR SOME EVENT, I THINK THERE'S JUST A\nLOT OF JITTERS, PEOPLE SAYING I'VE MADE MONEY THIS YEAR IN\nSOME OF THE HIGH FLIERS AND THE STOCKS THAT ARE WINNING ARE\nSTOCKS NOT NECESSARILY SUSTAINABLE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE\nTHEY'RE TECHNOLOGY AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU BOTH.\nIT'S WONDERFUL TO SEE YOU. >> THANK YOU.\nWONDERFUL TO BE HERE.

WE SAW WHERE THE STOCK PRICE WAS\nLAYING AROUND AND THIS YEAR WAS THE TIME TO BUY A WHOLE BUNCH\nBACK. >> WE HAVE A LOT OF RETAIL\nINVESTORS. WHEN YOU SAY BOOK VALUE, WHAT\nYOU'RE SAYING IS BASICALLY WHAT THIS COMPANY IS WORTH, ITS LAND,\nITS PROSPECTS. >> THAT'S RIGHT.\nIF WE HAVE THE LEADING MARGIN IN THE INDUSTRY, YOU WOULD THINK\nOUR BOOK IS PRETTY SECURE. >> YES.\nTHAT'S WHAT'S CONFUSING ME. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANT TO\nGO OVER, YOU MENTIONED ABOUT THE HIGH END.\nWHAT IS THE SENSITIVITY BOTH TO THE HIGH END BECAUSE THAT'S\nWHERE YOU ARE, AND THEN TO THE OTHER END WHERE SOME OF THESE\nSTOCKS ARE DOING MUCH BETTER THAN YOURS, BUT I CAN'T FIGURE\nIT? AN INCREASE, SAY, OF A HALF A\nPOINT IN MORTGAGE RATES. WHO DOES IT HURT MORE?\n>> IT HURTS THE LOWER END MORE BECAUSE IT COMES DOWN TO\nAFFORDABILITY. IT COMES DOWN TO DOLLARS AND\nCENTS OF WHAT THEY CAN AFFORD IN A GIVEN MONTH.\nDO THEY CONTINUE TO RENT, OR IS THE RATE SUCH THAT THEY CAN\nAFFORD TO OWN? OUR BUYERS DON'T MAX OUT THEIR\nMORTGAGES. OUR AVERAGE LTV IS 70 PSHSZ, 20%\nOF OUR BUYERS ARE ALL CASH. THIS IS THEIR SECOND, THIRD,\nFOURTH HOME THEY'RE BUYING IN THEIR LIFE.\nWHILE A MAJOR MOVE IN RATE WOULD HURT US, A SMALL TICK WILL HAVE\nNO IMPACT. I'VE ALWAYS SAID I WILL TAKE A\nRATE THAT'S 4%, 4.25% IN A STRONG ECONOMY OVER 3.5% RATE\nWHERE WE'VE BEEN FOR A LONG TIME.\n>> RIGHT. >> IN AN ECONOMY THAT IS NOT AS\nGOOD. SO WHEN THE FED TALKS ABOUT\nMAYBE THERE'S A RATE INCREASE AND THE BUILDERS SELL OFF, THAT,\nTO ME IS GOOD NEWS THERE MIGHT BE A SMALL RATE INCREASE BECAUSE\nTHE ECONOMY IS STRONG, YET THE MARKET IS REACTING SHORT TERM\nWITH A SELL. >> ARE YOU STILL BUYING STOCK?\n>> WE HAVEN'T BOUGHT ANY YET THIS QUARTER.\n>> OKAY. >> BUT WE WILL CERTAINLY\nCONTINUE TO BE IN THE MARKET, AND YOU WILL SEE US CONTINUE\nWHEN THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTS ITSELF TO BUY STOCK BACK.\n>> IS THERE NEWS THAT IS GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO BUY IT?\n>> WE'RE ALWAYS BOUNCING LAND OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE WITH THE\nMONEY WE HAVE BECAUSE THAT'S OUR GROWTH.\n>> RIGHT. >> VERSUS STOCK BUY BACK, AND WE\nWILL CONTINUE TO BALANCE. >> LET'S TALK AROUND THE\nCOUNTRY. CALIFORNIA, HOW IS IT.\n>> FABULOUS. >> REALLY?\n>> FABULOUS. WE'RE IN COASTAL CALIFORNIA,\nNORTHERN AND SOUTHERN. WE'RE NOT INLAND.\n>> OKAY. >> WE DID A HUGE DEAL TWO YEARS\nAGO WHEN WE BOUGHT CHAPPELLE, $1.6 BILLION, WHICH IT\nTRANSFORMED THE COMPANY. WE NOW HAVE 25% OF OUR BUSINESS\nCOMING OUT OF CALIFORNIA. ORANGE COUNTY, L.A. COUNTY,\nVENTURA COUNTY, SOUTH BAY AND EAST BAY OF SAN FRANCISCO,\nFABULOUS. >> AVERAGE PRICE OF THOSE\nPLACES? >> 1.2 MILLION TO 1.5 MILLION ON\nAVERAGE. >> THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM?\n>> WE'RE KILLING. >>.\n>> HOW ABOUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY?\n>> OUR BEST MARKET IS DETROIT. NOT A LOT OF JOB GROWTH IN THE\nMIDWEST. WE'RE ALSO IN MINNEAPOLIS,\nCHICAGO. WE LIKE WHAT'S GOING ON IN\nMICHIGAN. THERE'S BEEN MORE JOB GROWTH AS\nTHE AUTO COMPANIES HAVE DONE BETTER, BUT THAT'S NOT A BIG\nGROWTH TERRITORY FOR US. >> FLORIDA?\n>> FLORIDA IS GOOD. WE NEED MORE LAND.\nVERY HARD TO FIND LAND. WE'RE DOING VERY WELL IN\nJACKSONVILLE. WE'RE DOING VERY WELL IN\nORLANDO, WHICH TEND TO BE PRIMARY HOME MARKETS.\nAND THEN THE SECOND HOME MARKET AND THE RETIREMENT AREAS OF THE\nGOLD COAST OF THE EAST AND THE WEST COAST, THEY'RE GOOD.\nWE JUST NEED MORE LAND. >> THEN ROUND CIRCLE FROM WHAT\nHA BEEN NOT THAT GREAT, NORTHEAST, GREAT.\n>> NORTHEAST IS GREAT. YOU KNOW, WE DOMINATE BOSTON TO\nWASHINGTON. THAT'S OUR HOME TURF.\nWE'RE OUT OF PHILADELPHIA. VERY FEW BIG NATIONAL BUILDERS\nARE THERE, SO WE TEND TO DOMINATE THE LAND BUYING.\nWE HAVE A GREAT BRAND BECAUSE WE GREW UP THERE.\n>> RIGHT. >> IT'S HARD TO FIND LAND.\nIT'S HARD TO GROW BECAUSE IT'S SO DIFFICULT TO GET LAND\nENTITLED. IT MAY TAKE FIVE YEARS IN NEW\nJERSEY TO GET A FARM APPROVED FOR HOUSES.\nWHEN YOU GET IT, IT'S GOLD. >> I WANTED TO ASK YOU, I'VE\nBEEN LOOKING AT THIS APPLE HOME KIT.\nIS THAT SOMETHING -- IS IT TOLL BROTHERS OUTFITTED\nELECTRONICALLY TO BE ABLE TO DO THE KIND OF HOME KIT THINGS THAT\nWE SEE? >> WE DO A LOT OF IT.\nWE DON'T USE APPLE RIGHT NOW. WE'RE LOOKING INTO THAT.\nWE USE ANOTHER COMPANY CALLED CONTROL 4.\nBUT WE'RE ALL OVER IT. >> LAST QUESTION.\nTHE FORTUNE RANKINGS WERE PRETTY AMAZING.\nTELL PEOPLE WHAT YOU ARE AND HOW THAT HAPPENED.\n>> \"FORTUNE\" MAGAZINE RANK TSZ THE MOST ADMIRED COMPANIES BY\nINDUSTRY AND WE'VE BEEN WINNING IN HOME BUILDING.\nTHEN THEY RANK WORLDWIDE OF ALL INDUSTRIES FOR THE QUALITY OF\nPRODUCT. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN LITTLE TOLL\nBROTHERS OUT OF PHILADELPHIA IS NUMBER 6 ON THIS LIST WORLDWIDE.\nTHE ONLY COMPANIES IN THE WORLD AHEAD OF US ARE APPLE, AMAZON,\nNORDSTROM, GOOGLE, AND DISNEY. THAT'S IT.\nAND THEN TOLL. >> I THOUGHT THAT WAS AMAZING.\nYOU'RE THE MOST OPTIMISTIC I'VE HEARD YOU, AND I HEAR YOU IN ALL\nDIFFERENT VENUES, THAT I CAN RECALL.\n>> YOU KNOW, JIM, WE ANNOUNCED THREE WEEKS AGO, THREE WEEKS\nINTO OUR NEW QUARTER, THAT OUR DEPOSITS, WHICH IS AN INDICATOR\nOF WHAT'S COMING BECAUSE IT'S WHEN SOMEBODY PUTS A CHECK DOWN\nON A LOT, WERE UP 23% FOR THOSE THREE WEEKS.\nWE'RE NOW THREE WEEKS FURTHER IN.\nWE ARE UP 25%. >> THAT'S GREAT NEWS.\nTHAT'S NEWS. >> WE'RE ROLLING.\n>> ALL RIGHT.

JUST BECAUSE T-MOBILE, THE\nTHIRD-LARGEST CARRIER IN THE U.S. SAYS THEY'RE UP FOR X --\nTHERE ARE SUBSCRIBERS WHO HAVE GONE FROM $23 MILLION IN 2013 TO\n$31 MILLION. THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR\nTHEM TO GET PEOPLE TO SWITCH FROM OTHER CARRIERS.\nAND THEY'RE DOING TRADE-INS, ALL OF THIS STUFF.\nTO ME, THAT'S ALL GOOD FOR APPLE.\nBUT IT'S NOT -- EASY, I THINK, TO EXTRAPOLATE TO WHAT'S\nREQUESTING GOING ON WITH 150 MILLION SUBS THAT AT&T AND\nVERIZON HAVE. >> ONE OTHER THING, THOUGH.\nWE TALKED ABOUT THE DISCIPLINE OF NOT PUTTING SO MUCH EFFORT\nINTO THE CAR -- THE CAR BUSINESS, I THINK, IS SMART.\n>> SO COST DISCIPLINE. YEAH.\n>> AND PART OF THE ARGUMENT TODAY, WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT\nRBCs PUT OUT THERE -- THIS IS SOMETHING WE HAVE BEEN POUNDING\nTHE TABLE FOR A LONG TIME. PARTIALLY THE ECOSYSTEM, AS\nWELL. ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT ELEMENTS\nTO WHAT APPLE IS DOING. I'M NOT PUTTING ALL THAT MUCH ON\nTHE T-MOBILE THING. I'M SAYING IT'S INTERESTING,\nBECAUSE EVERYBODY WENT INTO THIS AND SAID THIS IS A DUD.\nTHERE IS NOTHING THERE. AND MEANWHILE, ONE OF THE CHIP\nMAKERS THAT SUPPLY TO APPLE, WHAT HAVE THEY SAID SINCE THE\nEND OF JULY? JUST ABOUT EVERY ONE OF THEM\nTHAT'S VERY DEPENDENT ON APPLE, SOME OF THESE SKYWORKS, YOU LOOK\nAT WHAT THEIR NUMBERS ARE AND YOU SAY, HOLY SMOKES, THEY HAVE\nBEEN TELLING US THAT DEMAND FROM APPLE IS STRONG.\nAND SO IF THAT'S THE CASE, AND WE ALL KNOW THAT TLS, WHEN YOU\nLOOK AT SOME OF THE NUMBERS COMING OUT OF THOSE CHIP MAKERS,\nTHAT SAYS A LOT ABOUT WHERE THIS PHONE IS, AS WELL.\nSO TO YOUR POINT SAYING, WELL, AT&T -- I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO\nBE VERY, VERY SURPRISED WHEN THE NUMBERS ACTUALLY COME OUT.\n>> I THINK THIS IS A MARKET PHENOMENON.\nTHIS IS TOTALLY A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE -- OVERWHELMED BY\nVALUATIONS. EVERYONE IS TELLING THEM HOW\nCOULD YOU OWN STOCKS, HOW COULD YOU OWN BONDS?\nI GET BACK TO WHAT I SAID. PLUS YOU ADD IN THE PART --\nTHINK ABOUT WHERE APPLE IS IN ITS PRODUCT CYCLE AND CALENDAR.\nWE'RE GOING IN THE BEST TWO QUARTERS.\nNO REASON WHY APPLE SHOULD HAVE BEEN RALLYING THE LAST SIX\nMONTHS. IT'S NOT THAT IT WAS AN\nUNDERWHELMING iPHONE 7. >> WASN'T A GREAT PERIOD FOR\nAPPLE AND ALL THESE OTHER -- STARS ARE ALIGNING.\n>> SO IF THE CAMERA IS A LITTLE BIT LATER, WHAT I'VE ALWAYS\nSAID, A MASSIVE REFRESH BASE AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S ALWAYS\nA WIND. >> IF YOU WERE SELLING AT STOCK\nAT 103 MONDAY MORNING, THE IDEA OF BUYING AT 111 RIGHT NOW\nDOESN'T MAKE A HECK OF A LOT OF SENSE.\nI HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS FOR A WHILE.\nI WAS VERY WRONG ON NEAR-TERM PRICE ACTION A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.\nI TOOK IT OFF TODAY. WHEN YOU SEE THE PRICE ACTION\nTHAT IT HAD HERE, YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE BETTING AGAINST IT.\nI WOULD BE REALLY SHOCKED AND I KNOW PETE SAW THIS ACTION.\nTHE MOST ACTIVE OPTIONS IN APPLE TODAY, THE OCTOBER 130 CALLS.\nMANY BEING BOUGHT. THIS IS A VERY LOW PROBABILITY\nBET. THINK ABOUT WHAT THE HIGH IN\n2014 WAS. IT WAS BACK AT 133, 134.\nAND IT'S AN EASY WAY TO LEVER OFF AN EXISTING LONG POSITION.\nBUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S GOING STRAIGHT BACK THERE, JUST\nBECAUSE IT'S -- >> IS THIS THE LAW OF LARGE\nNUMBERS FOR THE STOCK IN? I KIND OF FEEL LIKE YOU'VE HAD\nTHIS MARKET CAP MOVE. THAT'S A HUGE MOVE.\nI'M SAYING THIS IS IT. >> CONTINUE OR WHAT?\n>> I'M VERY -- I'M VERY NEUTRAL. IF MILDLY BULLISH ON APPLE.\nI'M JUST TELLING YOU, AFTER THIS MOVE AT 114, YOU HAVE MASSIVE\nRESISTANCE. JUST GOTTEN THROUGH AT LEAST THE\nBEST WEEK.

RELATIVE TO OTHER TECH TITANS.\nWE'RE GOING TO PLAY OUR FAVORITE GAME.\n\"WOULD YOU RATHER.\" WOULD YOU RATHER AMONGST TECH\nTITANS. APPLE OR FACEBOOK?\nPETE. >> RIGHT NOW, I SAID AT THE VERY\nTOP OF THE SHOW, I DON'T THINK IT'S A MUST-BUY, NECESSARILY.\nI DID BUY T BECAUSE I LIKE IT. BUT IF YOU GIVE ME THE CHOICE\nBETWEEN THOSE TWO NAMES RIGHT NOW, I THINK THERE IS MORE\nMOMENTUM UNDER ZUCKERBERG. MORE THINGS IN THE PIPELINE\nUNDER ZUCKERBERG. THE ACQUISITIONS HE'S MADE, I\nWOULD GO WITH FACEBOOK. >> FOR MY BOOK, A MUCH BIGGER\nBET IN FACEBOOK BY A LOT THAN APPLE.\nFOR -- >> ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THAT,\nI DON'T OWN FACEBOOK, AND I HAVE OWNED APPLE AND CONTINUE TO\nOWN -- ADDED TO APPLE. SO I GUESS I'M TALKING AGAINST\nMY BOOK RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE I SHOULD BE MORE\nPOSITIONED IN FACEBOOK THAN I AM.\n>> WHY ISN'T YOUR BOOK ALIGNED WITH WHAT YOU JUST SAID?\n>> BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE RUN THAT FACEBOOK HAD, JUST LIKE\nAPPLE, THIS RUN HAS BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY FAST UP TO THESE\nPARTICULAR LEVELS, CALL IT 130. SO THAT'S BEEN A FAST RUN TOO.\nI EXPECT SOME SORT OF A PULLBACK OUT OF FACEBOOK, AS WELL.\nTIM IS TALKING ABOUT APPLE, MAYBE AS IF PEAKING OUT.\nI DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE. BECAUSE WHEN I LOOK AT APPLE,\nTHE ONE DIFFERENCE IS VALUATION. BUT I THINK IN TERMS OF THE MOST\nMOMENTUM, I THINK YOU LOOK AT FACEBOOK.\n>> NEXT UP HERE, WOULD YOU RATHER APPLE OR GOOGLE?\nTIM. >> GOOGLE.\nAND MY BOOK SAYS THAT. I'M LONG GOOGLE.\nI DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON APPLE.\nI THINK GOOGLE IN THIS ENVIRONMENT, WHERE PEOPLE ARE\nSTRING GENTLY LOOKING AT STOCKS, A PHENOMENAL BALANCE SHEET.\nBUT IN TERMS OF INVASION AND PLACES WHERE YOU CAN HAVE UP\nSIDE AND YOUTUBE AS WE SAID ALL THESE THINGS ABOUT FACEBOOK, I\nTHINK YOU'VE GOT THAT SAME EXPOSURE WITH GOOGLE.\nAND YET YOU'VE GOT A CORED CASH GENERATED BUSINESS LIKE APPLE.\nMAYBE PRICED IN RELATIVE GROWTH TERMS, ACTUALLY, BETTER THAN\nAPPLE. SO GOOGLE.\n>> DAN? >> I AGREE WITH THAT.\nI THINK GOOGLE, YOU KNOW, RELATIVE TO THEIR EXPECTED\nGROWTH, NORTH OF 20% FOR EPS AND SALES TOO AT -- WHERE IT'S\nTRADING HERE TO ME, MAKES TOTAL SENSE.\nTHAT BEING SAID, I'M GOING TO TELL YOU GUYS THIS.\nYOU MAY FALL OFF YOUR CHAIRS HERE.\nI WAS VERY NEAR READY TO BUY APPLE.\n>> WHEN? >> IF IT GOT TO A NINE HANDLE.\n>> WHY DIDN'T YOU, THOUGH? WHY --\n>> CAN I JUST SAY SOMETHING? AND I MEAN THIS SERIOUSLY.\nI AM NOT ALL HYPED UP ABOUT THIS CYCLE.\nI THINK WHAT'S REALLY GOING TO HAPPEN, IF THEY EVER HAVE A HIT\nON THE WEARABLE FRONT AND THEN WE GET TOWARDS THAT TEN-YEAR\nANNIVERSARY OF THE iPHONE, THAT'S GOING TO BE A BIG FOCUS.\nI DO NOT THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE A BIG UPGRADE CYCLE.\nSO I WOULD NOT BE BEING IT AT 112, 113, AND CLOSED AT 111.\nGOOGLE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BREAK OUT.\nI DO THINK THAT APPLE HAS THE -- THE POTENTIAL TO DISAPPOINT AND\nGO BACK BELOW 100 BUCKS, WHERE IT ALMOST WAS MONDAY MORNING.\n>> LAST UP, APPLE OR MICROSOFT. PETE.\n>> I STILL THINK HE'S GOT A FEW THINGS UP HIS SLEEVE.\nI WOULD SAY -- CAN I GO RIGHT BACK TO THE GOOGLE?\nI'LL TAKE APPLE OVER GOOGLE. AND THE REASON I SAY THAT ONE --\nSORRY. I KNOW --\n>> YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY \"WOULD YOU RATHER.\"\n>> LOOKING AT THIS VALUATION -- MONEY, THEY'VE GOT IT.\nGROWTH, ECOSYSTEM. SO FOR ALL THOSE REASONS THAT\nNAME IS BETTER. MICROSOFT, STILL WITH NADELLA\nEARLY IN HIS TENURE, A BETTER NAME RIGHT NOW.\n>> WHAT DO YOU SAY? >> TO ME, THIS IS A TIME RISE IN\nTRADE. I ACTUALLY THINK THAT APPLE\nMAYBE HAS SOME MORE ROOM TO RUN. IF WE'RE QUESTIONING WHERE\nMICROSOFT HAS SHOWN AND PRICED INTO SATYA THAT DELL'S CLOUD.\nI THINK MICROSOFT HAS ACTUALLY GOTTEN THEMSELVES INTO A NEW\nPOSITION WHERE THEY HAVE CASH COWS AND RELEVANCY THEY DIDN'T\nHAVE. >> DAN?\n>> I PROBABLY WOULD GO WITH APPLE OVER MICROSOFT.\nAND TO ME, I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING YOU'RE SAYING.\nBUT WHEN I THINK ABOUT OFFICE 365 AND AZURE, I DON'T REALLY\nTHINK OF THESE AS THE NEXT LEG OF GROWTH.\nTO ME, ESPECIALLY WITH OFFICE 365, A REPOSITIONING OF THEIR\nEXISTING PRODUCT LINE. AZURE, SO FAR BEHIND.\n>> BUT -- >> IRRELEVANT.\n>> I KNOW IT IS, BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE\nTO COMPETE WITH AMAZON. I WOULD RATHER OWN APPLE THAN\nMICROSOFT. >> LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.\nBASICALLY, EXCEPT IN YOUR SHORT-TERM SCENARIO, EVERYBODY\nWOULD RATHER OWN THE OTHER CHOICE OVER APPLE.\n>> UH -- WELL, MAYBE NOT -- I FIND MYSELF IN THE UNUSUAL\nSITUATION OF AGREEING WITH EVERYTHING DAN JUST SAID\nREGARDING MICROSOFT VERSUS APPLE.\nBUT YEAH, GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK -- I WOULD RATHER OWN THEM AND I DO\nRATHER OWN THEM. >> YOU DO.\n>> I DO. >> I JUST THINK IF YOU -- FIRST\nOF ALL, HOW CAN WE SIT HERE AND SAY WE LOVE APPLE WHEN THREE\nWEEKS AGO, WHEN APPLE WAS TRADING AT 98, 95, 98 BUCKS, WE\nWERE, YOU KNOW, NOT ALL THAT BULLISH.\nI THINK WE WERE POINTING OUT HEADWINDS.\nI WASN'T RUNNING FOR COVER ON THE STOCK.\nI ACTUALLY FELT LIKE THERE WAS OPPORTUNITIES AND AS WE GET INTO\nTHIS REFRESH CYCLE, PLACES FOR IT TO OUTPERFORM.\nI THINK IT'S DISINGENUOUS TO SAY LET'S BUY APPLE NOW, ESPECIALLY\nAFTER IT'S GONE FROM -- TO 114. >> WE'RE GOING TO SAY -- iPHONE\n7 WAS GOING TO BE A TERRIBLE PHONE WITH NO INNOVATION, AND\nHERE WE ARE SAYING IT'S BETTER THAN EXPECTED.\n>> DAN SAID THAT. >> AND SHOWS THAT APPLE CAN, IN\nFACT, INNOVATE. >> HERE'S THE THING.\nAND I THINK THIS IS A CONSENSUS AMONG EVEN THE MOST PESSIMISTIC\nPEOPLE. WHAT THEY HAVE IN THAT PHONE IS\nOBVIOUSLY -- THE BEST SMARTPHONE ON THE MARKET RIGHT NOW.\nIT'S JUST NOT THAT EXCITING. THIS IS A COMPANY THAT'S MADE\nTHEIR BONES WITH INDUSTRIAL DESIGN.\nNOTHING HAS CHANGED, RIGHT? AND THEY'RE NOT CONVINCING US\nBASED ON A TRICKED OUT NEW CAMERA THAT THIS -- YOU HAVE TO\nGO OUT AND SPEND $750 TO UPGRADE.\nI'M TELLING YOU, WHAT HAPPENED THIS WEEK, THERE IS NO NEW NEWS.\nTHIS PHONE IS GOOD. AND PEOPLE EXPECTED IT TO BE\nGOOD. WHAT ABOUT THIS -- THE WATCH?\nTHAT WASN'T IT PARTICULARLY EN NOVATIVE, AND ANYTHING STICKILY\nINTERESTING. THE EAR BUDS, I KNOW THAT PEOPLE\nARE SAYING THIS IS -- >> IT'S NOT ABOUT THE WATCH.\nNEVER HAS BEEN. >> BUT, TIM, IT'S 70% OF THEIR\nSALES ARE COMING FROM ONE PRODUCT.\nWHICH IS WHAT HER CONCERN IS, A VALUE BUYER OF A COMPANY THAT\nTRADES, 12 TIMES EARNINGS. IT REALLY HAS TO BE ABOUT\nSOMETHING ELSE. IF YOU TALK ABOUT LAW OF LARGE\nNUMBERS -- >> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SERVICES.\n>> SERVICES. >> SERVICES.\n>> AND GROWTH. >> 19% LAST QUARTER AND 12% OF\nTHEIR OVERALL SALES. BETTER START TO HAPPEN.\nSO APPLE MUSIC HAS 17 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS.\nYOU KNOW WHAT SPOTIFY JUST ANNOUNCED TODAY?\n40 MILLION. >> HOW MANY USERS DO THEY HAVE,\nTHOUGH? >> NOT THE KEY TO THE WHOLE --\n>> THE USERS ARE THE SERVICES. >> HUGE PART OF THEIR ECOSYSTEM,\nTIM. >> APPLE PAY -- I THINK IT'S THE\nENTIRE LOYALTY OF THE BRAND THAT HOWS PEOPLE TO MONETIZE\nTHROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM. AND SO APPLE MUSIC ISN'T A\nTERRIBLY EXCITING THING, EXCEPT FOR THE FACT APPLE HAS 1 BILLION\nSUBS. >> YOU GUYS WERE FALLING OUT OF\nYOUR CHAIRS WHEN CHINA WAS GROWING -- SERVICES IN THE LAST\nQUARTER GREW 19%. >> WE'VE GOT TO GO.\n>> 19%. >> I'LL TAKE 19%.\n>> ALL RIGHT. UP NEXT --\n>> HUGE BASE. >> BAD NEWS -- CONTINUING -- I\nAM TALKING, PEOPLE! >> SORRY.\n>> BAD NEWS JUST KEEPS ON COMING FOR WELLS FARGO AND FEDERAL\nPROSECUTORS. >>> PLUS, OFFICIALLY GAME DAY\nFOR TWITTER WITH THE LAUNCH OF",

SO, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS\nCAMPAIGN AND BOTH CANDIDATES, WHAT HAVE BEEN THE FIVE THINGS\nTHAT SHOW REALLY GLARING ERRORS WHEN IT COMES TO HAVING A\nRELATIONSHIP WITH THE TRUTH? WE'VE GOT ANSWERS FOR YOU.\nJOINING US RIGHT NOW TO GEOVER WHAT THE CANDIDATES ARE SAYING\nAND WHAT'S TRUE? POLITIFACT EDITOR ANGIE.\nSO, YOU'VE GIVEN US YOUR TOP FIVE AND YOU COULD HAVE TOP 55,\nBUT LET'S DO 5 AND WE'LL START WITH DONALD TRUMP AND MEXICO.\nDONALD TRUMP SAYS THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT, THEY SEND THE BAD\nONES OVER. THAT'S WHAT HE SAYS.\nTHAT CLAIM, HOW DID YOU JUDGE IT?\n>> WE RATED THIS ONE PANTS ON FIRE.\nTHAT MEANS, INACCURATE AND RIDICULOUS.\nTHERE'S NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THIS.\nMOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME OVER FROM MEXICO ARE LOOKING FOR\nJOBS AND WORK. AND THAT'S WHY WE SAW ILLEGAL\nIMMIGRATION DROP PRECIPITOUSLY DURING THE RECESSION.\nSO, WE TALKED TO A LOT OF EXPERTS WHO STUDY THE BORDER AND\nMIGRATION PATTERNS AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND THEY SAID THIS IS A\nMYTH. SO, PANTS ON FIRE.\n>> ALSO IGNORES THE CONTEXT THAT MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE\nILLEGALLY OVERSTAY VISAS AFTER FLOWN TO THE COUNTRY.\nNOT ALL RUNNING ACROSS THIS BORDER THAT ALLEGEDLY NEEDS A\nWALL. SO, NOW, HILLARY CLINTON.\nFBI DIRECTOR COMEY CALLED HER COMMENTS ABOUT E-MAIL TRUTHFUL.\n>> COMEY WAS CAREFUL TO STEER AWAY FROM ANY ENDORSEMENT LIKE\nTHAT. HE SAID HER ACTIONS WERE\nCARELESS. SO, THIS ONE, NOT TRUE.\nWE RATED IT PANTS ON FIRE. >> NOW, THE CONFUSION WE GET\nINTO AND I'M SURE YOU DO, TOO. SHE DID SOMETHING ILLEGAL.\nIT WAS ILLEGAL. SHE BROKE THE LAW.\nHOW DO YOU HANDLE THAT CLAIM? >> YOU KNOW, SHE HAS NOT BEEN --\nTHE FBI DECLINED TO BRING ANY CASE AGAINST HER.\nSO, AS FAR AS THE LEGAL SYSTEM GOES, THAT'S NOT, THAT'S NOT\nRIGHT NOW. AND, YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOME\nOTHER SENSE THAT THE EXPERTS WE TALKED TO SAID THIS WAS BAD FOR\nARCHIVING PURPOSES. IT WAS BAD FOR TRANSPARENCY\nPURPOSES. BUT ILLEGAL, THE GOVERNMENT\nPROSECUTORS DIDN'T MAKE THAT CASE.\n>> ALL RIGHT, BACK TO DONALD TRUMP.\nTRUMP SAYS HE OPPOSED THE IRAQ WAR.\nAS YOU KNOW, THIS HAS BEEN A BIG ONE ON THIS SHOW.\nI OFFER PEOPLE A \"NEW DAY\" MUG WHICH IS A COVETED ITEM, IF THEY\nCAN SHOW US ANY PROOF THAT TRUMP WAS AGAINST THE WAR BEFORE IT\nACTUALLY WAS WELL UNDER WAY. HOW DO YOU RATE IT?\n>> WE RATED THIS FALSE. IT'S NOT ACCURATE.\nHE KEEPS SAYING IT. WE'VE BEEN FACT CHECKING THIS\nONE ALONG WITH ALL THE OTHER FACT CHECKERS FOR MONTHS.\nHE POINTS TO AN \"ESQUIRE\" ARTICLE THAT WAS PUBLISHED WELL\nAFTER THE WAR STARTED. SO, THIS ONE IS JUST WRONG, TOO.\n>> HE HAS THAT TRANSCRIPT THAT HIS SUPPORTERS REFER TO THAT\nDOES NOT HELP HIS CAUSE. SO, HILLARY CLINTON SAID SHE\nNEVER SENT OR RECEIVED CLASSIFIED INFO VIA E-MAIL.\nWHAT DO YOU HAVE? >> WE RATED THIS ONE FALSE.\nTHERE WAS CLASSIFIED INFORMATION IN HER E-MAIL AND SOME WAS\nMARKED. THE CLINTON TEAM WILL ARGUE IT\nWASN'T MARKED PROPERLY WITH HEADERS AND THAT IS FINE.\nBUT THERE WAS CLASSIFIED INFORMATION IN THE E-MAIL AND\nCOMEY'S REPORT SAID SHE SHOULD HAVE REALIZED THIS.\n>> OKAY. THEN TRUMP ON TAX RETURNS.\nDONALD TRUMP SAYS HIS FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES MORE THAN MAKE UP\nFOR LACK OF RELEASING TAX RETURNS.\nWHAT DO YOU SAY? >> TOTALLY FALSE.\nHE SAYS HE HAS ALL THIS DISCLOSURE.\nACTUALLY, THE TAX RETURNS ARE HUGE AREA WHERE WE DON'T HAVE\nANY TRANSPARENCY. THE TAX RETURNS WOULD SHOW WHICH\nOF HIS ASSETS PRODUCED INCOME. THEY WOULD SHOW SOME OF HIS\nFINANCIAL TIES. AND THEY WOULD SHOW HOW MUCH HE\nGIVES TO CHARITY. THAT'S BECOME AN ISSUE IN RECENT\nWEEKS. ABOUT THE TAX RETURNS ARE NOT\nRELEASED SO THERE ARE ALL THESE THINGS THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP'S FINANCES THAT WE NORMALLY KNOW ABOUT THE MAJOR\nCANDIDATES. >> WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON HOW\nDIFFICULT THE CLIMATE IS RIGHT NOW?\nYOU HAVE CLINTON GIVES OUT 40 YEARS OF TAXES AND FRUMP WON'T\nGIVE OUT ANY BECAUSE HE'S UNDER PROOF OF AUDIT.\nHE COULD GO BACK 30 YEARS IN TAXES, IF HE WANTED.\nHIS OPPONENT WENT 40. YOU CAN'T GET THE INFORMATION\nUNLESS HE GIVES IT TO YOU. HOW HARD IS IT TO FACT CHECK?\n>> IT'S CHALLENGING, BUT THERE IS SOME THINGS WE KNOW ABOUT\nTRUMP'S FINANCIAL RECORDS. SOME THINGS WE KNOW ABOUT HIS\nBUSINESS BACKGROUND AND THAT SORT OF THING IS BEING REVEALED.\nI WOULD EXPECT DONALD TRUMP TO BE CHALLENGED ON THIS DURING THE\nDEBATES. THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES\nRELEASING THEIR TAX RETURNS. NOT THAT THEY ARE REQUIRED TO,\nBUT THEY ALWAYS DO. IT'S LIKE A CULTURAL NORM.\nSO, HE'S BREAKING WITH THIS. NOW, SOMETIMES THE CANDIDATES\nDECIDE TO DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY, THE CLIMATE CHANGES, BUT THIS IS\nA BIG THING. THIS IS SIGNIFICANT INFORMATION\nTHAT'S NOT AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC.\n>> YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK THIS SHOULD BE AN ISSUE, ABOUT\nTRUMP'S WIFE. BILL CLINTON WAS DIFFERENT, HE\nWAS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nBUT SHE GIVES HER IMMIGRATION INFORMATION TO IMMIGRATION\nLAWYER AND HE PUTS OUT A LETTER VETTING IT AND THAT IS NOT\nHELPFUL TO US BECAUSE HE CAN ONLY JUDGE AS A LAWYER, NOT AS\nSOME INDEPENDENT BODY WHAT HE GAVE HER.\nTHIS HAS LITTLE TRICKY. >> WE ALWAYS WANT TO VERIFY\nINFORMATION AND WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT IT OURSELVES.\nOUR FACT-CHECKING REPORTS WE LIST ALL THE SOURCES AND IF THE\nINFORMATION IS ONLINE WE LINK TO IT.\nNOT JUST JOURNALISTS, BUT THE PUBLIC.\nTHEY DON'T WANT TO TAKE PEOPLE'S WORD FOR IT.\nTHEY WANT TO SEE THE EVIDENCE AND THE DOCUMENTATION FOR\nTHEMSELVES. >> NOW WE HAVE THIS ISSUE WITH\nTRUMP AND HIS BUSINESS DEALINGS NOT TO SUGGEST THAT THEY ARE\nBAD, BUT HE DOES SO MUCH INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS, WE\nSHOULD SHOW WHAT IT IS. THAT INFORMATION IS LARGELY\nUNDER HIS OWN CONTROL. AS IT BECOMES PUBLIC WE KNOW\nYOU'LL BE ON IT AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING YOU BACK ON\nTHE SHOW.

THERE IS MORE INFORMATION.\nWHEN SHE SAYS TRANSPARENT, THERE ARE -- SHE'S GIVEN OVER HER\nTAXES.

THEY ARE BOTH GOING TO THEIR\nPERSONAL PHYSICIANS, AND YOUR PERSONAL PHYSICIAN IS YOUR\nADVOCATE. NO DOCTOR IS GOING TO SAY, MY\nPATIENT REALLY TREATS THEIR BODY LIKE A SPRING-BRAKE RENTAL CAR.\nTHAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. VOTERS ARE GOING TO LOOK AT WHAT\nTHEY SEE AND EYEBALL IT AND MAKE THAT DETERMINATION FOR\nTHEMSELVES. >> THEY NEED TO DO SOMETHING IN\nORDER TO DO THAT. >> ULTIMATELY, WE'RE THE ONES\nTHAT DECIDE IF THEY'RE FIT ENOUGH TO BE PRESIDENT.\nIT WAS RELEVANT IN '92, WHEN PAUL SONG WAS RUNNING FOR\nPRESIDENT AND HE WAS BATTLING CANCER AND SAID HE WAS GIVEN A\nCLEAN BILL OF HEALTH, RELEVANT WITH JOHN McCAIN, AFTER SPENDING\nALL OF THOSE YEARS AT THE HANOI HILTON, SO VOTERS WILL MAKE THAT\nDETERMINATION. >> BAKARI SELLERS, DO YOU AGREE\nWITH THAT? >> YEAH, BECAUSE IT'S RELEVANT\nNOW, DONALD TRUMP WILL BE THE OLDEST SITTING PRESIDENT IF HE'S\nELECTED AND HILLARY CLINTON WILL BE THE SECOND OLDEST.\nSO IT'S VERY RELEVANT TODAY.

I MEAN, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT\nVOTERS NEED TO SEE, AND DESERVE TO KNOW.\n>> WITH THE TACO BOWL AND THE McDONALDS.\nLET ME SAY THIS. IN ALL SERIOUSNESS, THIS IS WHAT\nHE SAID.

OZ HE SAID HE DIDN'T\nEXERCISE AND SAID HE WANTS TO LOSE AT LEAST 15 POUNDS AT LEAST\nAND HE'S ON MEDICATION TO CONTROL HIS CHOLESTEROL.\nTHAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THE HEALTHIEST INDIVIDUAL, IF YOU'RE\nDOING THAT. AS A MATTER OF FACT, HE SAID\n236, THE AUDIENCE MEMBER SAYS 267.\nIF HE'S ANYWHERE IN THAT RANGE, FOR A 6'3\" MAN, HE'S OVER WEIGHT\nIF HE'S AT 236, AND IF HE'S AT 260, HE'S OBESE.\nTHAT DOESN'T SOUND, ANDY, AS THE MOST HEALTHIEST AND FIT PERSON.\n>> DON, FIRST, LOOK, HE LOOKS FANTASTIC TO ME AND I'LL TELL\nYOU THIS, HE IS GETTING EXERCISE IN THE SENSE HE'S FLYING TO TWO\nOR THREE DIFFERENT STATES A DAY AND HE WALKS THESE LINES AND\nSHAKES VOTERS' HANDS AND HE'S MOVING HIS ARMS UP AND DOWN.\nHE MAY NOT BE DOING THE BOWFLEX. >> ANDY, ARE YOU REALLY SAYING\nTHAT.

IF SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN SORT OF\nON BOTH SIDES OF PARTIES AND HAS BEEN SORT OF NONPARTISAN TO SOME\nDEGREE, HE HAS WATCHED HER IN THE ROLE THAT HE HAD AND HE'S\nDETERMINED SHE SCREWS UP EVERYTHING --\n>> COLIN POWELL -- >> WITH ARROGANCE.\nWITH ARROGANCE. >> COLIN POWELL GETS TO CAST THE\nDECIDING VOTE FOR PRESIDENT, I'LL TAKE THAT.\n>> SERIOUSLY? >> I THINK NOW WE SEE WHY HE HAS\nHESITATED IN COMING OUT TO ENDORSE WHEN YOU READ SOME OF\nWHAT HE SAYS IN THE E-MAILS. >> LET'S NOT FORGET ACCORDING TO\nBUZZFEED WHICH GOT SOME MORE HACKED E-MAILS, HE ALSO CALLED\nBENGHAZI THE CONTROVERSY OVER BENGHAZI, I'M QUOTING HERE, A\nSTUPID WITCH HUNT. WHICH WOULD NOT MAKE A LOT OF\nREPUBLICANS WHO HAVE SPENT AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME AND MONEY IN\nCONGRESS PURSUING BENGHAZI. >> THIS IS ALL A RUSSIAN LEAK TO\nDAMAGE THE DEMOCRATS, THAT DOESN'T EXACTLY DAMAGE THE\nDEMOCRATS HERE. >> NO.\nBUT THERE'S A REASON I THINK THEY ARE TARGETING GENERAL\nPOWELL, THAT THEY TARGETED THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, THEY TARGETED\nI GUESS A VARIETY OF DEMOCRATS. >> INCLUDING TIM KAINE.\n>> IS THAT RIGHT? >> HIS CELL PHONE NUMBER WAS\nRELEASED. >> THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON\nHERE. I'M NOT AN INTELLIGENCE PERSON.\nI JUST READ THE PAPERS. THE REPORTS THE INTEL FOLKS ARE\nGIVING TO THE PRESS SAY THIS ALL POINTS BACK TO RUSSIA.\nFOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFETIME WE HAVE A MAJOR PARTY\nNOMINEE WHO IS OPENLY PRO-RUSSIAN AND THE RUSSIAN\nGOVERNMENT NOT VERY FRIENDLY TO AMERICA.\nIT'S AN ASTONISHING DEVELOPMENT. EXCUSE ME IF I THINK VOTERS WILL\nSTITCH THOSE TWO THINGS TOGETHER AND BE VERY TROUBLED.\n>> WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT IS THIS HIGHLIGHTS HOW IMPORTANT\nSECURITY OF CLASSIFIED AND REGULAR GENERAL COMMUNICATIONS\nARE. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THAT ISSUE,\nYOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO HILLARY CLINTON AND HOW NEGLIGENT AND\nCARELESS SHE WAS WHEN SHE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROTECT AND\nSAFEGUARD HER OWN E-MAILS. >> WE DON'T HAVE HACKED E-MAILS\nFROM HILLARY CLINTON. WE HAVE HACKED E-MAILS THAT\nPOINT TO RUSSIA. >> -- WHICH COLIN POWELL BY THE\nWAY TOLD HER NOT TO DO. >> WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT\nSOMETHING ELSE. THERE'S A BIG STORY IN\n\"NEWSWEEK\" WHO GOES EXTENSIVELY INTO THE TRUMP CORPORATION,\nTRUMP INC., AND TALKS ABOUT ENTANGLEMENTS OVERSEAS AND WHAT\nTHAT MAY MEAN FOR THE WHITE HOUSE.\n>> A VERY COMPLICATED STORY. SOMETHING THAT WE HAVEN'T\nINVESTIGATED VERY THOROUGHLY BUT ARE SEEING IT IN TODAY'S\n\"NEWSWEEK\" ARTICLE. WE ARE SEEING THAT THE TRUMP\nORGANIZATION HAS BUSINESS TIES ALL AROUND THE GLOBE WITH VERY\nPOWERFUL BUSINESSMEN. THESE BUSINESSMEN AT SOME TIMES\nHAVE, THEY ARE AT ODDS WITH THEIR GOVERNMENT.\nTHE QUESTION IS RIGHT NOW FOR DONALD TRUMP, WHO HAS ALL OF\nTHIS BUSINESS WITH THESE FOREIGN COUNTRIES, WILL FOREIGN LEADERS\nNOW MAKE DECISIONS BASED UPON DONALD TRUMP'S WANTING FOR HIS\nPRIVATE BUSINESS HOPING TO INFLUENCE U.S. FOREIGN POLICY\nWHICH IS A VERY VERY BIG QUESTION.\nALSO, THE QUESTION IS, WHEN DONALD TRUMP SAID THAT HE WOULD\nHAND THIS OVER IN A BLIND TRUST TO HIS FAMILY, THEY POINT OUT\nTHAT DOESN'T MATTER. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS IF\nTRUMP'S FAMILY IS RUNNING THE COMPANY, THERE IS STILL GOING TO\nBE AN EFFORT BY THESE FOREIGN LEADERS TO TRY TO INFLUENCE U.S.\nFOREIGN POLICY ON SOME MAJOR DECISIONS, KNOWING FULL WELL HIS\nCOMPANY WOULD BENEFIT FINANCIALLY FROM IT.\nWHAT IS REALLY TROUBLING IS IN THE CASE OF TURKEY RIGHT NOW,\nWHERE YOU HAVE THE PRESIDENT OF TURKEY WHO IS NOT VERY HAPPY\nWITH DONALD TRUMP, AND EICHENWALD SAYS HE'S BEEN TOLD\nBY TURKISH LEADERS THAT IF TRUMP WERE ELECTED PRESIDENT, THEN IN\nFACT, WE COULD IMPERIL THE USE OF THE U.S. AIR BASE THAT IS\nBEING USED RIGHT NOW BY U.S. BOMBERS TO TARGET ISIS.\nIT'S DEFINITELY A VERY COMPLICATED THING AND CERTAINLY\nANOTHER ISSUE, MAJOR ISSUE, ONLY 55 DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION.\n>> IN AN UNCOMPLICATED WAY, YOU SAID IT REALLY WELL.\nHE CONTINUES TO POINT TO PUTTING IT INTO A BLIND TRUST, HIS\nDAUGHTER EVEN THIS MORNING SAYS AND WE WOULD RUN IT.\nTHAT'S KIND OF UNBLIND TRUST OF THE BLIND TRUST.\n>> RIGHT. IT SEEMS COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE\nIN A WAY TO DISENTANGLE YOURSELF, YOUR BUSINESS, YOUR\nFAMILY, GIVEN THESE INTERNATIONAL CONFLICTS, FROM\nBECOMING -- FROM BEING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nIT'S VERY DIFFICULT. NOW, WE HAVE HEARD DONALD TRUMP\nTALK ABOUT SHUTTING DOWN THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nSHUT IT DOWN. WELL, DEMOCRATS CAN NOW RAISE\nTHE POINT SHUT THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION DOWN IF THEY WANT,\nIF MORE REPORTING SHOWS, AND THIS IS WELL REPORTED BUT IF\nMORE REPORTING COMES OUT THAT THERE IS SUCH A DEEP\nENTANGLEMENT HERE THAT HOW WOULD YOU POSSIBLY TAKE YOURSELF AND\nYOUR FOREIGN POLICY OUT OF THAT WHOLE MIX?\n>> LOOK, IF TRUMP'S SAYING WITH THE CLINTON FOUNDATION SHUT IT\nDOWN NOW, DIDN'T HE SET HIMSELF UP FOR EXACTLY THAT REQUEST?\n>> I WOULD VENTURE TO SAY HILLARY CLINTON WOULD NOT SAY\nSHUT IT DOWN AND PUT WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS THOUSAND PEOPLE\nOUT OF BUSINESS. >> THAT WOULD PUT A LOT OF\nPEOPLE OUT OF BUSINESS IF THEY SHUT DOWN THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION. >> I DON'T THINK AS MUCH.\nTHEY SAID OTHER NONPROFITS WOULD BE IN POSITION TO TAKE OVER SOME\nOF THE GOOD WORK THE CLINTON FOUNDATION HAS DONE.\n>> THE ISSUE IS THIS. DOESN'T THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN OWE\nIT TO VOTERS TO EXPLAIN TO THEM HOW THERE WOULD BE A DIVISION\nBETWEEN THE TRUMP CORPORATION AND THE WHITE HOUSE?\n>> I'M GLAD YOU ASKED THAT. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAME UP\nIN THE PRIMARY AS EARLY AS I THINK I WANT TO SAY JANUARY OR\nFEBRUARY. HE'S ALWAYS BEEN CONSISTENT AND\nSAID LOOK, I KNOW, I'M TELLING YOU I HAVE AN EMPIRE OF\nPROPERTIES ALL OVER THE WORLD AND WHEN I DO BECOME PRESIDENT I\nHAVE TO DISMANTLE IT. >> THAT'S NOT DISMANTLED --\n>> PASS IT OFF TO MY CHILDREN AND HAVE THEM RUN THE COMPANY\nAND HE HAS SAID HE'S NOT GOING TO TAKE A ROLE IN THE COMPANY.\nTHAT HAS BEEN THE POSITION -- >> HOW DOES THAT INOCULATE HIM?\nTHEY ARE HIS KIDS AND ARE SOME OF HIS CHIEF POLICY ADVISERS\nRIGHT NOW. >> I DON'T THINK IF THEY WOULD\nBE HIS CHIEF POLICY ADVISERS AND HAVE A FIDUCIARY DUTY.\n>> IVANKA TRUMP HAS CONCEPTUALIZED THE CHILD CARE\nPOLICY. YOU DON'T THINK THERE WOULD BE A\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST IF THEY RAN THESE COMPANIES AND ARE THE\nARCHITECTS OF THESE POLICIES? >> LET'S BE OBJECTIVE.\nTRUMP HAS BEEN KIND OF TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE SINCE HE GOT\nINTO THE ELECTION. PEOPLE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT IT.\nTHIS IS NOT -- I MEAN, I GUESS IT'S A NEW NEWS STORY BUT THIS\nIS REHASHING SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED ALREADY.\n>> IF THERE WAS A CLEAR ANSWER ON HOW IT WOULD BE DISMANTLED OR\nSHUT DOWN OR DIVIDED THE STORY WOULD BE OVER.\n>> PAUL, YOU GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS?\n>> OH, YEAH. HE NEEDS TO RELEASE HIS TAX\nRETURNS. THIS IS WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT.\nIF YOU TELL ME WHO YOU OWE MONEY TO, I WILL TELL YOU WHO YOU ARE\nGOING TO OWE LOYALTY TO. WE DON'T KNOW WHO TRUMP IS IN\nBUSINESS WITH, WE DON'T KNOW WHO IS FINANCING HIM.\nWE DON'T KNOW. VOTERS HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW.\nMR. TRUMP HAS DECIDED THEY DON'T.\nTHAT MAKES THIS A REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE.\nTHIS IS A REALLY CLEAR ONE. HILLARY HAD A BRIEF MEDICAL\nRELEASE WE TALKED ABOUT. TRUMP HAD AN EVEN BRIEFER ONE.\nOKAY. SLIGHT WIN FOR --\n[ SPEAKING SIMULTANEOUSLY ] >> -- OBAMA --\n>> CHARITY WATCH INDEPENDENT GROUP THAT RATES THESE THINGS.\nHEAD OF CHARITY WATCH SAYS THIS IS ONE OF THE GREAT FOUNDATIONS\nOF OUR GENERATION. THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.\nNOT ME. THE GUY WHO RATES THESE THINGS.\nTHE TRUMP ORGANIZATION IS FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT.\nIT'S FOR PROFIT, TO BEGIN WITH. IT'S NOT TRANSPARENT.\nHE HAS GOT TO RELEASE THE TAXES. OVER 60% OF AMERICANS, DOESN'T\nMATTER WHAT I      [ \"On The Road Again,\"\n       by Willie Nelson ]\n     \u00e2\u0099\u00aa On the road again \u00e2\u0099\u00aa                     the 2017\n                    Passat S                   for just $199\n                     a month.
