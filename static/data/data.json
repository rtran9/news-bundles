THAT WAS IN REFERENCE TO MITT\nROMNEY'S 47% COMMENT.

IT'S NEVER A GOOD IDEA.\nHAVING SAID THAT, IT IS TOO SIMPLE TO DESCRIBE THIS AS A\nGAFFE THAT WOULD HURT HER. THE FUNDAMENTAL DIVIDING LINE\nBETWEEN THE TWO COALITIONS IS -- IT IS OVERWHELMINGLY COMPOSED OF\nTHE GROUPS MOST COMFORTABLE WITH THE INCREASINGLY DIVERSE\nCULTURALLY AND RACIAL SOCIETY WE'RE EVOLVING INTO AND TAKING\nON THIS FIGHT, HILLARY CLINTON IS PORTRAYING HERSELF AS\nDEFENDING THOSE VALUES AGAINST A CANDIDATE THAT THEY VIEW AS\nUNIQUELY THREATENING TO THOSE VALUES.\nSO IN THE SAME WAY THAT THIS IS I THINK DONALD TRUMP IS GOING\nTO, YOU KNOW, BAT, YOU KNOW, BANG ON THIS TO MOBILIZE HIS\nBASE, IT IS SOMETHING THAT UNIFIES THE MODERN DEMOCRATIC\nCOALITION. HIS KEY COMPONENTS\nOVERWHELMINGLY. FOR EXAMPLE, ABC/\"WASHINGTON\nPOST\" POLL VIEW TRUMP AS BI BIASED --\n>> MIKE PENCE WAS ON WITH WOLF AND ASKED ABOUT THE KKK, FORMER\nKKK GRAND MASTER DAVID DUKE AND WHETHER HE'S DEPLORABLE.\nSO HE WENT OUT, HE SAID I DISAVOW HIM, WE DON'T WANT HIS\nSUPPORT.",

DAVID, LET ME ASK YOU, PRESIDENT\nOBAMA, IN PHILLY TODAY, IN PENNSYLVANIA.\nPENNSYLVANIA, A STATE THAT HAS NOT VOTED FOR A REPUBLICAN FOR\nPRESIDENT SINCE 1988. DOES THE FACT THAT HE WENT TO\nPENNSYLVANIA SUGGEST THAT THAT STATE IS IN PLAY?\n>> WELL, IT DEFINITELY SUGGESTS THAT.\nTHERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. ALSO, WHERE HE WENT SPECIFICALLY\nIN PHILADELPHIA IS WITH A TASK AT HAND BECAUSE THERE ARE\nCERTAIN PARTS OF THE OBAMA COALITION THAT RIGHT NOW HILLARY\nCLINTON IS UNDERPERFORMING WITH IN A LOT OF BATTLE GROUND STATE\nPOLLS. SPECIFICALLY WITH LATINOS AND\nYOUNG PEOPLE. SO GOING TO A MINORITY HEAVY\nCOMMUNITY LIKE PHILADELPHIA WHERE IT ALSO HAS A LOT OF YOUNG\nPEOPLE, HE IS THERE TO ACTUALLY TURN OUT THE COALITION.\nBUT MORE BROADLY TO PENNSYLVANIA AND YOUR POINT, I THINK\nPENNSYLVANIA MAY END UP BEING ONE OF THE KEYS TO THIS\nELECTION. DONALD TRUMP'S PATH, AS WE'VE\nTALKED ABOUT, IT IS NARROW. IT'S A TOUGH CLIMB TO GET --\n>> HE HAS TO RUN THE TABLE REALLY.\n>> HE DOES. PENNSYLVANIA IS A TRIGGER FOR\nHIM. IF HE CAN'T MAKE AN INROAD THERE\nAND ACTUALLY CONVERT THAT STATE, HIS ABILITY TO GET TO 270\nBECOMES MUCH MORE COMPLICATED. HE HAS TO PUT LIKE SEVEN OTHER\nREALLY COMPETITIVE STATES ON HIS SIDE.\nPENNSYLVANIA, IF HE CAN WOO IT TO HIS SIDE, OPENS UP A PATH TO\n270. >> I AGREE IT'S KEY.\nHE IS GOING THERE THIS EVENING TO PRESENT HIS PLAN FOR PAID\nMATERNITY LEAVE. REBECCA, I WONDER, OTHER\nREPUBLICANS IN THE PAST, EVERYONE ALWAYS TALKS ABOUT\nGOING AFTER PENNSYLVANIA THE SAME WAY DEMOCRATS ALWAYS TALK\nABOUT MISSOURI. AND AT THE END OF THE DAY,\nTHREE, FOUR WEEKS OUT I THINK HE MEANS IT.\nMR. TRUMP I THINK WILL BE CAMPAIGNING THERE UNTIL THE VERY\nEND. >> THE REASON HE IS DOING FAIRLY\nWELL IN PENNSYLVANIA AND MAYBE BETTER THAN WE WOULD EXPECT IS\nBECAUSE, AS YOU KNOW, THE WHITE WORKING CLASS -- THERE IS A\nHIGHER PROPORTION THAN IN OTHER STATES.\nTHAT'S WHY TRUMP IS DOING WELL IN IOWA WHICH OBAMA WON BY FIVE\nPOINTS IN 2012. BECAUSE HE WAS ABLE TO WIN OVER\nTHE WHITE WORKING CLASS IN A WAY HILLARY CLINTON IS NOT.\nDONALD TRUMP IS COMPLETELY CONSOLIDATING THIS DEMOGRAPHIC.\nIN STATES WITH A HIGHER PROPORTION OF WHITE WORKING\nCLASS, A LOWER PROPORTION OF COLLEGE-EDUCATED VOTERS, HE HAS\nA REALLY GOOD CHANCE. WITH THE NEW MESSAGE HE IS\nLOOKING TO BRING NEW VOTERS IN HIS FOLD.\nSUBURBAN WHITE WOMEN. WITH THE PAID MATERNITY PUSH.\nIT'S NOT A CONVENTIONAL REPUBLICAN POSITION.\nIT'S ONE SOME OF TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS IN THE PAST LIKE\nLAURA INGRAM AND SEAN HANNITY HAVE MOCKED.\n>> IT'S A DEMOCRAT POSITION, BASICALLY TO HAVE SIX WEEKS PAID\nMATERNITY LEAVE FOR MOMS. DAVID, LET ME ASK YOU, THE\nATTEMPT TO GO AROUND THE COLLAR OF PHILADELPHIA AND WINNING OVER\nTHE MOMS. WHEN MIKE PENCE REFUSES TO USE\nTHE WORD \"DEPLORABLE\" TO TALK ABOUT DAVID DUKE AND IT COMES IN\nTHE CONTEXT OF A LOT OF RATHER DEPLORABLE PEOPLE BEING VERY\nVOCAL TRUMP SUPPORTERS, NOT A MAJORITY, NOT HALF, BUT A LOT OF\nTHEM. AND I JUST WONDERED, DOES THAT\nHURT THAT ATTEMPT TO GO INTO THE COLLAR, TO GO INTO MONTGOMERY\nCOUNTY AND THE OTHER SUBURBS OUTSIDE PHILLY AND TO OTHER\nWOMEN? >> IT'S WHY WE SEE -- YOU KNOW,\nWHEN DONALD TRUMP WAS OUT COURTING THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nVOTE, GOING -- YOU REMEMBER HE WENT TO MICHIGAN, HE WENT TO\nOTHER PLACES. EVEN THOUGH HE WAS TALKING TO\nLARGELY WHITE CROWDS INITIALLY BEFORE THE DETROIT TRIP, HE WAS\nTALKING ABOUT HIS WOOING OF THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE AND HOW\nWELL HE THOUGHT -- WE TALKED THEN, IT WASN'T ABOUT JUST\nTRYING TO DIG INTO HILLARY CLINTON'S ENORMOUS ADVANTAGE\nWITH AFRICAN-AMERICANS. PART OF THAT WAS TO APPEAL TO\nWHITE SUBURBANITES AS A MORE TOLERANT PERSON THAN THEY THINK\nHE IS. THAT HE IS WILLING TO DO THE\nOUTREACH. THAT WAS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF\nWHAT HE WAS DOING. WHEN MIKE PENCE DOESN'T WANT TO\nUSE THE WORD \"DEPLORABLE\" AND WON'T USE THAT AND SAY DAVID\nDUKE IS DEPLORABLE AND THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN MAKES HAY OF\nTHAT, THE FIRST PLACE THAT WILL BE FELT IS IN THESE SUBURBAN\nAREAS. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN PEOPLE WHO\nMAY BE ON THE FENCE, IF THEY THINK THE TRUMP/PENCE CAMPAIGN\nIS TOLERANT OF THIS HATRED, IT BECOMES A HUGE TURNOFF.\n>> YOU DON'T WANT TO USE THE SAME WORD AS HILLARY CLINTON.\nWHY NOT JUST SAY IT'S DISGUSTING, RACIST, I HATE IT, I\nDON'T WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO IT.\nWE'VE SEEN THIS DONALD TRUMP RETWEETING WHITE SUPREMACISTS,\nPEOPLE WITH THE NAME \"WHITE GENOCIDE\" IN THEIR HANDLE.\nEXPLAIN TO ME WHAT YOU THINK IS GOING ON.\n>> IT'S A LITTLE CONFUSING BECAUSE MIKE PENCE WILL GO OUT\nTHERE AND SAY WE DON'T WANT HIS SUPPORT, WE DON'T WANT THE\nSUPPORT OF PEOPLE WHO THINK THE WAY THAT DAVID DUKE THINKS.\nBUT THEN GOING ONE STEP FURTHER TO SAY DEPLORABLE IS A LINE HE\nWON'T CROSS. PART OF THIS CALCULATION, I\nTHINK, IS THAT THEY RECOGNIZE THEIR CORE SUPPORTERS ARE\nCOMPRISED, IN PART, BY THESE ALT-RIGHT PEOPLE, BUT PEOPLE WHO\nHAVE THESE WHITE NATIONALIST VIEWS.\nAND THEY DON'T WANT TO TURN OFF ANY CORE SUPPORTERS IN THE LAST\n55 DAYS OF THIS ELECTION. BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO JUST AN\nADMISSION BY THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN THAT THIS IS NOT TURF THAT'S\nFAVORABLE TO THEM. THEY WANT TO MOVE THE\nCONVERSATION IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION.\nTHAT'S WHY I AM REALLY INTERESTED BY THIS TACTIC,\nFOCUSING ON THE BASKET OF DEPLORABLES COMMENT.\nBECAUSE TRUMP SEEMS TO THINK THAT THIS IS A GOOD -- IT'S A\nGOOD PIECE OF TURF FOR HIM, THAT HE CAN ENERGIZE HIS SUPPORTERS,\nSAY HILLARY CLINTON WAS INSULTING YOU, GET THEM RILED UP\nA LITTLE BIT. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THEN THE\nCONVERSATION IS, HOW MANY OF TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS ARE IN THE\nBASKET OF DEPLORABLES? >> IT'S NOT HALF.\nIS IT A THIRD, A QUARTER? >> AS YOU SAID, THEY HAVE\nDISAVOWED DAVID DUKE. DONALD TRUMP HAS DONE IT ON\nMULTIPLE OCCASIONS. YOUR INTERVIEW WITH HIM BACK IN\nFEBRUARY, IT WAS, I GUESS, WAS THE KICKOFF OF THAT NO DOUBT.\nBUT THEY HAVE DISAVOWED IT AS YOU'VE SAID.\nTHEY SAY WE ARE NOT INTERESTED IN THE SUPPORTERS.\nI THINK IT'S A PURE POLITICAL. THEY WANT THE WORD \"DEPLORABLE\"\nTO BE COMPLETELY OWNED BY HILLARY CLINTON NOW BECAUSE OF\nHER MISTAKE. >> TUNE INTO CNN TOMORROW NIGHT\nAT 9:00 P.M. EASTERN FOR \"ALMOST PRESIDENT, THE AGONY OF DEFEAT.\"\nTHEY WERE IN CHARGE OF HILLARY CLINTON'S PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVERS\nAND NOW THEY ARE NOT SAYING A WORD TO CONGRESS.\nONE DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER SHOWING UP ON CAPITOL HILL TODAY.\nTHAT STORY NEXT.",

              "text": ">>> WELL, DONALD TRUMP HAS\nPRESERVEN IF YOU ATTACK HIM, HE WILL NOT LET IT GO AND HE WILL\nFIGHT BACK. HE'S STILL GOING AFTER HILLARY\nCLINTON FOR CALLING HALF OF HIS SUPPORTERS A BASKET OF\nDEPLORABLES, QUOTE/UNQUOTE. IN NORTH CAROLINA HE ACCUSED\nMRS. CLINTON OF RUNNING A HATE-FILLED CAMPAIGN AND DIDN'T\nSTOP THERE. HAVE A LISTEN.\n>> SHE TALKS ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE THEY'RE OBJECTS, NOT HUMAN\nBEINGS. SHE CALLED THESE AMERICANS EVERY\nNAME IN THE BOOK. RACISTS, SEXISTS, SXENOPHOBIC,\nISLAMOPHOBIC. NEVER IN HISTORY HAS A MAJOR\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SO VICIOUSLY DEMONIZED THE AMERICAN\nVOTER. >> I THINK HE MEANT TO SAY\nXENOPHOBIC. FUNNY HE MENTIONED DEMONIZING\nAND HATE-FILLED SPEECH, BECAUSE THAT'S HOW HI CAMPAIGN IS\nDESCRIBED BY A LOT OF PEOPLE. A FEW THINGS HE'S SAID ABOUT\nMEXICANS AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN PEOPLE, JUST TO REFRESH YOUR\nMEMORY. >> WHEN MEXICO SENDS ITS PEOPLE,\nTHEY'RE NOT SENDING THEIR BEST. THEY'RE BRINGING DRUGS.\nTHEY'RE BRINGING CRIME. THEY'RE RAPISTS, AND SOME, I\nASSUME, ARE GOOD PEOPLE. >> IT IS A DISASTER, THE WAY\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE LIVING IN MANY CASES, AND IN MANY CASES\nTHE WAY HISPANICS ARE LIVING. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE?\nI WILL STRAIGHTEN IT OUT. I WILL BRING JOBS BACK.\nWE'LL BRING SPIRIT BACK. WE'LL GET RID OF THE CRIME.\nYOU'LL BE ABLE TO WALK DOWN THE STREET WITHOUT GETTING SHOT.\n>> THIS JUDGE IS GIVING US UNFAIR RULES.\nI'M BUILDING A WALL. OKAY?\nAND IT'S A WALL BETWEEN MEXICO -- NOT ANOTHER COUNTRY --\n>> IT'S NOT -- HE'S FROM INDIANA.\n>> HE IS OF MEXICAN HERITAGE AND VERY PROUD OF IT.\n>> I WANT TO BRING BACK MY PANEL.\nCNN STEPHEN COLONSON, AND POLITICS EDER AT THE ROOT DOT\nCOM JASON JOHNSON AND UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, LARRY SABATO.\nJASON BEFORE THE BREAK I TOLD YOU I WANTED TO GET INTO THE\nTHIS AND THAT AND HOW THEY TREAT THE PRESS, BECAUSE A LOT OF\nTIMES HOW THEY TREAT THE SPRES HOW THEY TREAT THE PUBLIC.\nWE'RE ASKING QUESTIONS ON BEHALF OF THAT PESKY PUBLY, SO WE ARE A\nPESKY PRESS. TRUMP TREATED THE PRESS\nDEPLORABLE, PENNED US UP, BLACKBALLED PEOPLE WHO ASKS\nQUESTIONS HE DOESN'T THINK IS FAIR.\nHILLARY CLINTON, NO PROTECTION IN EITHER OF THEIR CAMPS AND\nJUST LAST WEEK WHEN A PRESS PERSON DARED TO TALK ABOUT THE\nCOUGHING, THE QUOTE FROM THE CAMPAIGN IS, \"GET A LIFE.\"\nNOT PARTICULARLY GOOD BEHAVIOR ON EITHER OF THEIR PARTS.\n>> NOT AT ALL, BUT ASHLEIGH, I THINK THE KEY ISSUE IS THIS --\nBOTH OF THESE CAMPAIGNS ARE GOING TO TREAT THE PRESS AS\nBADLY AS THEY'RE ALLOWED TO AND AS BADLY AS THE VOTERS ALLOW\nTHEM TO. THE CLINTONS HAVE BEEN\nSECRETIVE, SOMETIMES THEY'RE DOING BAD THINGS, SOMETIMES\nBECAUSE THEY'RE PARANOID. TRUMP THREATENED PEOPLE,\nSNATCHED PRESS CREDENTIALS PEOPLE I KNOW AFTER THEY'VE\nREGISTERED FOR THINGS AND MORE SO, WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT HIS\nHEALTH, HE'LL TALK TO DR. OZ, NOT A JOURNALIST.\nIT'S ABOUT BOTH CANDIDATES REALIZING I CAN TREAT THE PRESS\nHOWEVER I WANT, THE VOTERS AREN'T GOING TO MIND.\nWE NEED ANSWERS FROM BOTH OF THESE CANDIDATES BEFORE WE GO TO\nTHE VOTING BOOTH SO THAT IS UNFORTUNATE.\n>> AND LET ME BRING YOU BACK ON THE DIVISIVENESS.\nTHERE WERE SUPPORTERS BROUGHT UP ONSTAGE WITH TRUMP LAST NIGHT.\nI THINK A COUPLE OF EDUCATORS. AVERAGE AMERICANS WHO GOT UP ON\nTHAT STAGE AND SPOKE TO THAT CROWD SAYING I'M THE TRUMP\nSUPPORTER AM I ONE OF THE ONES IN THAT BASKET OF DEPLORABLES?\n>> IT'S VERY INTERESTING. THIS IS A STAGE OF THE CAMPAIGN\nAND A CONTROVERSY THAT BOTH CAMPAIGNS WANT TO TALK ABOUT.\nTHE DEPLORABLES ISSUE ALLOWS DONALD TRUMP, AS YOU SAID, TO\nPOSE AS THINK CHAMPION OF HEARTLAND, BLUE COLLAR VOTERS,\nTO RE-CREATE THAT PERSONA THAT HELPED HIM WIN THE PRIMARY RACE\nAND PORTRAY HILLARY CLINTON AT THE ELITE FROM THE EAST.\nA GOOD MESSAGE IN SWING STATES, MAY HELP SLIGHTLY AMONG VOTERS\nPERHAPS ON THE FENCE, BUT HAVE GREAT SUSPICIONS OF WASHINGTON\nAND GREAT IS A PSUSPICIONS OF T MEDIA AND DEMOCRATS.\nIT MAY PUSH VOTES IN THIS DIRECTION.\nAT THE SAME TIME, THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS ENGAGING ON THIS.\nIS IT ABOUT WHETHER TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN IS AN XENOPHOBES AND\nBIGOTS, SEXISTS, THAT'S GOOD FOR THEM.\nTHE WAY HILLARY CLINTON WINS THE GENERAL ELECTION IS DRIVE OUT\nTHE OBAMA COALITION FROM 2008 AND 2012 NAP IS THE KIND OF\nMESSAGE THAT COULD GET PEOPLE TO THE POLLS OR PERHAPS SORT OF\nWORRIED ABOUT WHETHER, AM I GOING TO VOTE FOR HILLARY?\nSHOW UP, OR NOT? >> SO, LARRY, YOU KNOW, IF YOU\nWERE WATCHING LAST NIGHT, A LOT OF VIDEO OF A TRUMP SUPPORTER IN\nTHE CROWD WHO APPEARED TO ATTACK A PROTESTORS.\nREALLY PHYSICALLY. I MEAN CHOKE AND PUNCH ONE OF\nTHE PROTESTORS. WE'VE SEEN THIS IN THE PAST.\nIT DOESN'T SEEM TO GET A LOT OF PLAY AFTER ABOUT TWO, THREE\nWEEKS, BUT HERE WE ARE AGAIN WITH NEW VIDEO OF IT.\nI'M WONDERING IF YOU HAVE THAT KIND OF THING COMPARED TO A\nVIDEO OF HILLARY CLINTON CALLING, YOU KNOW, HALF OF TRUMP\nSUPPORTERS A BASKET OF DEPLORABLES.\nWHAT HAPPENS WITH THE UNDECIDED VOTERS?\nWHAT IN THIS ELECTION CYCLE, AND IT'S HARD, BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO\nCOMPARE THIS TO ANY ELECTION CYCLE.\nWHAT HAPPENS WITH UNDECIDED VOTER WHO SEE UGLINESS LIKE THIS\nON BOTH SIDES? >> WELL, THEY MAY VOTE FOR GARY\nJOHNSON, THE LIBERTARIAN OR JILL STEIN, ANOTHER PARTY CANDIDATE.\nTHEY ARE POLLING TOGETHER AT LEAST 150 PER10% OF VOTE, UNUSU\nHIGH FOR INDEPENDENTS. THE TRUTH IS, WE TALK ABOUT\nTHESE INDEPENDENTS, DEPENDS HOW YOU DEFINE THEM, BUT I WOULD\nARGUE THERE ARE ACTUALLY 10% OR LESS THAT ARE TRULY UNDECIDED.\nMAYBE EVEN MID TO LOW SINGLE DIGITS.\nMOST PEOPLE KNOW HOW THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE.\nTHEY'RE LEANING, OR THEY HAVE FIRMLY DECIDED.\nIT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO BE UNDECIDED IN THIS PARTICULAR\nELECTION. MOST PEOPLE HAVE STRONG\nFEELINGS. >> SO I WANT TO PLAY SOMETHING\nTHAT HAPPENED ON THE MORNING SHOW HERE ON CNN, ON \"NEW DAY\nTODAY,\" BECAUSE SOMETIME THIS WEEK WE'RE EXPECTING AT LEAST\nMORE INFORMATION ABOUT HEALTH, MAYBE FROM BOTH OF THE\nCANDIDATES, MAYBE HILLARY WILL RETURN TO THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\nSHE SAID SHE'LL RELEASE MORE INFORMATION.\nDONALD TRUMP SAID HE GOT ANOTHER CHECKUP FROM HIS DOCTOR AND\nPLANS TO RELEASE MORE INFORMATION AND KELLYANNE CONWAY\nWAS ASKED ABOUT THAT ORIGINAL DOCTOR'S LETTER THAT MADE SO\nMANY OUTRIGHT LAUGH, THE ASTASTON\nINGISHINGLY GOOD HEALTH RECORD. >> AS FAR AS I CAN SEE THERE ARE\nTWO MAJOR PARTY CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AND ONLY\nONE HAS PNEUMONIA AND LIED ABOUT IT, ESPECIALLY TO THE PRESS.\nSHE ALWAYS THINKS SHE, TREATS YOU ALL LIKE SECOND-CLASS PRESS\nCONFERENCES. WON'T HAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE\nAND UPLIFTS, ASPIRATIONAL AND GOES ON TO ATTACK TENS OF\nMILLIONS OF AMERICANS THE VERY NEXT DAY.\n>> WELL, THAT SORT OF MIGRATED AWAY FROM THE HEALTH QUESTION\nAND I THINK THE HEALTH QUESTION REMAINS BIG.\nJASON, THE BIG PART OF IT IS, WILL THIS END UP BEING BATTLE OF\nTHE EXPERTS? BATTLE OF THE DOCTORS?\nWHOSE DOCTOR IS MORE CREDIBLE WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT THE\nCAMPAIGNS ARE GOING TO RELEASE? >> ACTUALLY I THINK IT'S A\nMATTER, ASHLEIGH, OF VOTER PERCEPTION.\nA GENDER ASPECT, AN HON NEFRTES ASPECT.\nA LONG TIME TRUMP SURROGATES HAVE SAID HILLARY'S SICK,\nUNHEALTHY. SHE'S GOT A BODY DOUBLE.\nBASICALLY SAYING THAT THE DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGN IS \"WEEKEND\nAT BERNIE'S.\" PASSED AWAY MONTHS AGO AND\nTHEY'RE PROPPING HER UP TO WIN THE WHITE HOUSE.\nTHIS PLAYS UP TO A NOTION OF A DISHONEST FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\nTHAT WORKS FOR DONALD TRUMP. ON A PRACTICAL LEVEL, MOST DON'T\nCARE. THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T HAVE TO\nLEAD US AGAINST THE WAR OF THE VIKINGS.\nAS LONG AS IT'S NOT CANCER OR LIFE-THREATENING, I DON'T THINK\nVOTERS WILL CHANGE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.\nIF HILLARY CLINTON COLLAPSES DURING A DEBATE, THAT'S ONE\nTHING. IF SHE CAN CONTINUE TO CAMPAIGN\nIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS, I DON'T THINK IT WILL CHANGE\nANYTHING. >> JASON JOHNSON WITH THE NEW 70\nIS THE NEW 50. I SAY WE CAN DO 68 AND 70,\nPEOPLE STARTING TO ASK ABOUT ALL SORTS OF THINGS.\nTHANK YOU OFTEN. APPRECIATE IT.\nTHANK YOU, GUYS.",

WE'VE ALREADY MET A HIGH\nSTANDARD OF TRANSPARENCY. WE KNOW THE LEAST ABOUT DONALD\nTRUMP OF ANY CANDIDATE IN RECENT AMERICAN HISTORY.\nKNOW VIRTUALLY NOTHING ABOUT HIS BUSINESS ENTANGLEMENTS, HIS\nFOREIGN INVESTORS. IT'S REALLY PAST TIME FOR HIM TO\nBE HELD TO THE SAME STANDARD NOT JUST AS ME BUT OF EVERYBODY ELSE\nWHO HAS SOUGHT THIS JOB. >> OKAY.\nSO WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING A LOT ABOUT TRANSPARENCY THIS\nMORNING. DONALD TRUMP HAS RELEASED FOUR\nPARAGRAPHS ON HIS MEDICAL RECORDS.\nSHE'S RELEASED TWO PAGES. IS THIS ENOUGH?\nWHAT DO VOTERS -- >> WELL, THEY DIDN'T COME FROM\nTRUMP. THEY CAME FROM THE DOCTOR.\n>> THAT'S RIGHT. WHO SAID HE'S IN ASTONISHING\nHEALTH. WE'LL GET TO ALL OF THAT.\nDONALD TRUMP, MEANWHILE, TAKING IT EASY ON CLINTON'S HEALTH, BUT\nHE IS POUNCING ON HER BASKET OF DEPLORABLES COMMENT, SAYING SHE\nHAS CONTEMPT FOR VOTERS. MIKE PENCE REFUSES TO CALL DAVID\nDUKE DEPLORABLE. SUNLEN SERFATY IS LIVE.\n>> Reporter: THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN TRYING TO KEEP THE SPOTLIGHT\nFOCUSED SQUARELY ON HILLARY CLINTON'S GAFFE.\nTRUMP ELEVATING THIS REALLY ONE STEP FARTHER LAST NIGHT AT HIS\nRALLY. HE CALLED UP A GROUP OF\nSUPPORTERS ON THE STAGE TO GIVE TESTIMONIALS AS IT WHY THEY\nTHINK THEY ARE NOT DEPLORABLE. HERE'S TRUMP LAST NIGHT.\n>> AFTER MONTHS OF HIDING FROM THE PRESS, HILLARY CLINTON CAME\nOUT AND FINALLY TOLD THE WORLD HOW SHE FEELS ABOUT THE PEOPLE\nOF THIS COUNTRY. SHE SAID TENS OF MILLIONS OF\nPATRIOTIC AMERICANS ARE A BASKET OF DEPLORABLES.\nHOW CAN YOU BE PRESIDENT -- HOW CAN YOU BE PRESIDENT FOR SO MANY\nPEOPLE? SHE TALKS ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE\nTHEY'RE OBJECTS, NOT HUMAN BEINGS.\n>> NOW, THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN TRIES TO GO ON THE OFFENSIVE ON THIS.\nHIS RUNNING MATE MIKE PENCE IS REALLY CAUSING THEM TO HAVE TO\nPLAY SOME DEFENSE. PENCE GETTING A LITTLE HEAT FOR\nHIS INTERVIEW YESTERDAY ON CNN WHEN HE WAS ASKED ABOUT SOME OF\nTHE SUPPORT THEIR CAMPAIGN HAS ATTRACTED FROM WHITE\nNATIONALISTS, INCLUDING FROM DAVID DUKE, A FORMER KKK LEADER.\nWELL, PENCE DISAVOWED DAVID DUKE'S SUPPORT, BUT HE REFUSED\nTO CALL HIM DEPLORABLE. HERE'S WHAT HE TOLD WOLF\nBLITZER. >> I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHY THE\nMEDIA KEEPS DROPPING DAVID DUKE'S NAME.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS DENOUNCED DAVID DUKE REPEATEDLY.\nWE DON'T WANT HIS SUPPORT, AND WE DON'T WANT THE SUPPORT OF\nPEOPLE LIKE HIM. >> SO YOU WOULD CALL HIM A\nDEPLORABLE? >> I'M NOT IN THE NAME CALLING\nBUSINESS, WOLF. YOU KNOW ME BETTER.\n>> Reporter: AND THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS POUNCED ONLY THAT,\nTWEETING OUT, QUOTE, IF YOU WON'T SAY THE KKK IS DEPLORABLE,\nYOU HAVE NO BUSINESS RUNNING THIS COUNTRY.\nSO THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN THERE, ALISYN AND CHRIS, CLEARLY\nSENSING SOME SMALL OPENING. >> OKAY.\nTHANKS SO MUCH FOR ALL OF THAT. LET'S DISCUSS IT WITH OUR PANEL.\nWE HAVE CNN'S SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST AND SENIOR EDITOR FOR\n\"THE ATLANTIC, RON BROWNSTEIN. GREAT TO HAVE ALL OF YOU HERE.\nRON, WHAT DO VOTERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW?\nDO THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW IF ONE OF THE CANDIDATES IS\nSUFFERING FROM PNEUMONIA? >> I THINK THEY HAVE THE RIGHT\nTO KNOW MORE THAN THEY KNOW. IT'S EXTRAORDINARY DECISION BY\nHILLARY CLINTON TO DECIDE ON FRIDAY AFTER DIAGNOSIS OF\nPNEUMONIA THAT, THAT DID NOT MEET THE STANDARD OF SOMETHING\nTHE PUBLIC SHOULD KNOW. AS ALWAYS, ON MANY FRONTS IN\nTHIS CAMPAIGN, HER BEST COMPARISON IS WITH DONALD TRUMP,\nWHO'S PROVIDED US WITH LESS INFORMATION BOTH ABOUT HIS\nHEALTH AND MORE EGREGIOUSLY ABOUT HIS TAXES THAN ANY\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE EVER BEFORE.\nWE HAVE TWO OF THE OLDEST CANDIDATES THAT HAVE EVER RUN\nFOR PRESIDENT. THERE SHOULD BE MORE RATHER THAN\nLESS DISCLOSURE. JOHN McCAIN BENT OVER BACKWARDS\nTO PROVIDE MEDICAL RECORDS IN 2008.\nI THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE UNQUESTIONABLE PRESSURE FOR THEM\nTO GIVE US MORE THAN THEY HAVE SO FAR, BUT IT WON'T BE AS MUCH\nAS MANY ARE HOPING. >> EXCUSE IS THE SYSTEM.\nTHERE ARE NO RULES THAT COMPEL ANYTHING MORE THAN THEY WANT TO\nDO. WE CAN PRESSURE THEM TO DO.\nI HOPE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE REALIZING WHEN THEY SAY THEY\nWANT TO KNOW MORE, THAT'S WHAT EMPOWERS THE MEDIA.\nTHERE'S THIS FICTION RIGHT NOW THAT SOMEHOW THE MEDIA HAS ITS\nOWN INDEPENDENT POWER. WE'RE ONLY AS GOOD AS WHAT THE\nPEOPLE WANT. IN YOUR REPORTING, WHAT HAVE YOU\nENCOUNTERED IN TERMS OF TRYING TO GET DISCLOSURE ONFOUNDATION.\nTHE PUSHBACK TO HER POINT IS NOBODY'S BEEN MORE TRANSPARENT\nTHAN ME. YEAH, BUT YOU HAVE TO BE\nINVESTIGATED FOR THE TRANSPARENCY TO COME OUT.\nNOW WITH TRUMP, WHAT'S BEEN YOUR EXPERIENCE?\n>> THEY'RE TRYING TO FOCUS SO MUCH ON HOW DONALD TRUMP ISN'T\nPUTTING OUT INFORMATION RATHER THAN HITTING A STANDARD THAT\nOTHER PREVIOUS PRESIDENTS AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES HAVE\nMET. ONE OF THE BIG DEBATES THAT\nTHEY'VE HAD IN THE CAMPAIGN IS WHETHER TO PUT HER DOCTOR ON THE\nPHONE WITH REPORTERS, WHETHER TO PUT OUT ALL OF THE SORT OF\nMEDICAL RECORDS, THE PAGES THAT, YOU KNOW, JOHN McCAIN, JOHN\nKERRY, AL GORE, GEORGE W. BUSH PUT OUT AND SORT OF CREATE, GIVE\nVOTERS A SENSE OF THE PHYSICAL HEALTH OF THE CANDIDATE.\nWHAT THEY'RE COMING BACK AGAINST, I THINK, IS HER DESIRE\nFOR PRIVACY, FOR PUTTING OUT AS LITTLE INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE,\nYOU KNOW, WHICH HAS BEEN A PATTERN OF SECRETARY CLINTON'S\nGOING BACK TO THE '90s. >> ZELENY REPORTED THAT HER OWN\nSTAFF, SOME OF THEM DIDN'T KNOW SHE HAD PNEUMONIA.\n>> DIDN'T KNOW. WE DID A LOOK THIS MORNING,\nGOING BACK AND LOOKING AT THE DECISION MAKING.\nSHE FOUND OUT FRIDAY MORNING SHE HAD THIS DIAGNOSIS OF PNEUMONIA\nAND DECIDED TO KEEP THE INFORMATION TO A REALLY TIGHT\nCIRCLE OF FAMILY MEMBERS, CLOSEST AIDES, PEOPLE WHO FOR\nYEARS AND DECADES IN SOME CASES HAVE KIND OF REINFORCED HER\nINSTINCT FOR PRIVACY, FOR HUNKERING DOWN BECAUSE OF THE\nBELIEF THAT INFORMATION CAN SO EASILY BE MANIPULATED BY\nCONSPIRACY THEORISTS, PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AGAINST HER.\n>> THIS IS ALSO JUST HER PERSONALITY.\nSHE DOESN'T OVERSHARE. SHE DOESN'T SHARE SITUATION\nOTHER PEOPLE WOULD. SHE SAID IN THAT INTERVIEW WITH\nANDERSON, I THOUGHT I WOULD JUST MUSCLE THROUGH IT.\nTHAT'S SORT OF A METAPHOR FOR HOW SHE'S HANDLED A LOT OF\nTHINGS IN LIFE. >> IT WASN'T A BIG DEAL TO HAVE\nANOTHER DEVICE WHEN SHE HAD HER E-MAILS.\nIT WASN'T A BIG DEAL NOT TO TELL PEOPLE SHE HAD PNEUMONIA UNTIL\nTHEY GET CAUGHT, UNTIL THERE BECOMES A COMPELLING REASON FOR\nTHESE THINGS TO BE OUT THERE. THAT'S WHY THERE'S THIS TRUST\nDEFICIT WITH HILLARY CLINTON. THIS WHOLE INCIDENT, ALL THE\nHEALTH CONCERNS ASIDE, JUST MADE PEOPLE REMEMBER THAT AGAIN, WHY\nTHEY MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO TRUST HILLARY CLINTON.\n>> LET'S SWITCH OVER TO TRUMP HERE.\nDO WE HAVE THE SOUND OF TRUMP TALKING ABOUT WHAT CLINTON SAID\nABOUT VOTERS? >> I THINK WE DO.\nLET'S PLAY THAT. >> I ASK YOU BECAUSE YOU KNOW.\n>> SHE CALLED THESE AMERICANS EVERY NAME IN THE BOOK.\nRACIST, SEXIST, XENOPHOBIC, ISLAMOPHOBIC.\nSHE SAID THEY WERE NOT EVEN AMERICAN.\nRIGHT. ANYBODY XENOPHOBIC?\nI DON'T THINK SO. I DON'T THINK SO.\nNEVER IN HISTORY HAS A MAJOR PARTY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SO\nVICIOUSLY DEMONIZED THE AMERICAN VOTER.\n>> RON, EXCEPT FOR HIM. WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?\n>> SOMETIMES IT'S JUST LIKE SOMETHING SCREAMS OUT BS ALERT.\n>> THIS IS WHERE DONALD TRUMP KIND OF CHALLENGES CONVENTIONAL\nJOURNALISM. WHEN YOU SAY SOMETHING THAT IS\nJUST SIMPLY THAT SEPARATED FROM THE FACT, THIS IS A CANDIDATE\nWHO CAME DOWN THE ESCALATOR AND TALKED ABOUT UNDOCUMENTED\nIMMIGRANTS AS RAPISTS, WHO SAID THAT A U.S.-BORN FEDERAL JUDGE\nCOULD NOT DO HIS JOB PRECISELY BECAUSE OF HIS ETHNIC HERITAGE.\nIT IS EXTRAORDINARY FOR HIM TO BE SAYING THAT, YOU KNOW, SHE'S\nTHE UNIQUE LY DEMONIZING LARGE GROUP OF AMERICANS.\n>> XENOPHOBIC IS FEAR OF OUTSIDERS.\n>> IN POLLING, THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT THE DONALD TRUMP\nCOALITION IS MUCH MORE HOSTILE TO THE IMPACT -- HE'S A MUCH\nMORE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF IMMIGRANTS.\nALWAYS A MISTAKE FOR A CANDIDATE TO ATTACK THE MOTIVATIONS OF\nPEOPLE. THERE ARE LOTS OF REASONS WHY\nPEOPLE ARE NOT VOTING FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nIT'S WRONG TO SIMPLY ATTRIBUTE IT TO KIND OF, YOU KNOW, BAD\nMOTIVES. BUT IT IS NOTEWORTHY THAT FOR\nTHIS MODERN DEMOCRATIC COALITION, DIVERSITY, TOLERANCE,\nINCLUSION ARE CORE VALUES. IN THIS DISPUTE, SHE IS\nPORTRAYING HERSELF AS SOMEONE WHO WILL STAND UP FOR THAT.\nIN THE SAME WAY THIS MOTIVATES THE TRUMP COALITION, I THINK IT\nALSO MOTIVATES THE CLINTON COALITION.\n>> THIS IS ALSO THE PLACE WE'RE HOPING TO GET THE TRUMP/PENCE\nTICKET INTO, WHICH WAS NOT FOCUS ON THE HALF THE VOTERS BUT ON\nTHE DEPLORABLES SO THEY HAVE TO END UP DEFENDING OR LOOK LIKE\nTHEY'RE DEFENDING PEOPLE LIKE DAVID DUKE.\nTHIS WAS SORT OF THE IDEA OF LIKE, OKAY, DONALD TRUMP, MIKE\nPENCE STAND UP FOR THE VOTERS WHO ARE SUPPORTING YOU, DEFEND\nWHAT THEY SAY, WHAT THEY DO. >> THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE\nDEMOCRATIC PARTY AND HILLARY CLINTON WANT TO CAST A BIG TENT\nFOR ALL OF THEM, EXCEPT REPUBLICANS, WHO SHE SAYS ARE\nDEPLORABLES. HERE'S MY QUESTION.\nWAS THAT INTENTIONAL, OR DID SHE MISSPEAK?\nTHERE'S A BIG DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER THAT IS THE MESSAGE THAT\nSHE'S TRYING TO SEND OUT TO EVERYONE.\nWE DON'T EVEN WANT THEM. WE DON'T LIKE THEM.\nOR WAS THAT JUST SHE JUST WENT OVERBOARD.\n>> IT SEEMS LIKE SHE DOESN'T WANT PEOPLE TO FEEL LIKE THEY'RE\nASSOCIATED WITH THE DEPLORABLES. SHE DOESN'T WANT PEOPLE TO WANT\nTO BE PART OF THAT CLUB. I WOULD \u00e2\u0096\u00a0ISAGREE THATSHE\nDOESN'T WANT REPUBLICANS. THEY'VE ACTUALLY TRIED TO\nRECRUIT, PARTICULARLY ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS, WHO\nHAVE BEEN RAGING AGAINST TRUMP THIS ENTIRE TIME.\n>> MY POINT IS, IS THAT THE WAY TO DO IT?\nCALL HALF OF DONALD TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS --\n>> NO, BECAUSE THIS COULD AFFECT THE BLUE-COLLAR VOTERS THAT HER\nHUSBAND AND JOE BIDEN HAVE BEEN WORKING SO HARD TO RECRUIT.\nIN PLACES LIKE PENNSYLVANIA, OHIO, IN THE RUST BELT.\nIF THEY HEAR THIS OUT OF CONTEXT, THEY COULD BE LISTENING\nTO TRUMP AND THINKING HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH.\n>> AS JACKIE NOTED, THE FLIPSIDE IS IN REALITY, THEIR SURER PATH\nTO VICTORY IS THROUGH THOSE WHITE-COLLAR SUBURBS.\nI THINK SHE WENT TOO FAR AND PHRASED IT IN A WAY THAT'S\nUNNECESSARILY POLARIZING AND OFFENSIVE TO VOTERS.\nI THINK AS JACKIE WAS SUGGESTING, THEY WANT THOSE\nVOTERS TO QUESTION WHETHER THIS IS A POOL YOU REALLY WANT TOP\nJUMP IN. IS THIS WHERE YOU SEE YOURSELF\nCUL CULTURALLY, OR DO YOU FEEL\nALIENATED FROM IT. AS YOU KNOW IN POLLING, TODAY\nSHE'S AHEAD AMONG COLLEGE EDUCATED WHITE VOTERS, WHICH NO\nDEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HAS EVER WON IN THE\nHISTORY OF POLLING. >> WE ALSO KNOW THE ANSWER TO\nYOUR QUESTION IS, YES, IT WAS INTENTIONAL, BECAUSE SHE HAD\nSAID THIS BEFORE ABOUT THE NATURE AND CHARACTER OF SOME OF\nHIS SUPPORTERS. THE 50% WAS NEW.\nTHAT WAS THE MISTAKE. SHE OVERREACHED.\n>> PANEL, STICK AROUND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\n>>> SO BILL CLINTON AND MIKE",

SHE ATTENDS MANY FUNDRAISERS.\nIN FACT, THAT'S WHY SHE WAS GOING TO CALIFORNIA.\nTHE MINUTE DONALD TRUMP DARES TO STEP IN A STATE, ALISYN, THAT'S\nEITHER OVERLY RED OR 0E6R8LY BLUE, THE MEDIA CNN SAYS WHY IS\nHE IN A NONSWING STATE? SHE GOES TO CALIFORNIA TO\nHOLLYWOOD TO RAISE MONEY. DID IT TWICE, SUPPOSED TO BE\nTHERE NOW. DID IT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO,\nTHEN SHE WENT TO HAMPTONS, MARTHA'S VINEYARD, NONE OF WHICH\nIS ARE SWING STATES. THAT'S OKAY.\nWHERE ARE HER RALLIES? PENSACOLA, FLORIDA, 12,500\nPEOPLE, 8, 10,000 PEOPLE WAITING OUTSIDE TO GET IN.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S TAX RECORDS.\nWHEN CAN WE EXPECT TO SEE THEM? >> WHEN HIS LAWYERS AND HIS\nACCOUNTANTS TELL THEM HE SHOULD RELEASE THEM WHEN HE'S NO LONGER\nUNDER AUDIT. HE'S VERY CLEAR.\n>> HAS DONALD TRUMP OR WILL HE RELEASE ANYTHING FROM THE IRS,\nPROVING THAT HE'S UNDER AUDIT? >> I'M SORRY?\n>> WILL DONALD TRUMP RELEASE ANYTHING FROM THE IRS PROVING\nTHAT HE'S UNDER AUDIT? >> ARE YOU CALLING HIM A LIAR?\nWE'RE TAKING HER WORD THAT SHE WAS OVERHEATED, DIDN'T HAVE\nPNEUMONIA. SHE'S GOING TO START TALKING TO\nTHE PRESS AGAIN. SERIOUSLY, WE'RE RUNNING AGAINST\nA CLINTON AND WE'RE GOING TO CHALLENGE SOMEONE'S VORACITY.\n>> THE LEADER OF LINKED-IN IS GOING TO GIVE VETERANS $5\nMILLION IF DONALD TRUMP RELEASES HIS TAX RETURNS.\nTHAT'S A CAUSE CLOSE TO MR. TRUMP'S HEART.\nWILL THIS BE AN IMPETUS FOR HIM DESPITE WE KNOW WHAT HIS LAWYERS\nHAVE SAID. THE IRS SAID HE CAN RELEASE IT.\nTEY WILL NOT PUNISH HIM. LOTS OF TAX ATTORNEYS SAID THEY\nCAN. WILL HE RELEASE IT NOW GIVEN\nTHIS MOTIVATION? >> NO.\nI HOPE THAT THAT MAN THINKS SO MUCH OF THE VETERANS THAT HE\nWOULD GIVE THEM $5 MILLION WHETHER OR NOT MR. TRUMP DEFIES\nTHE ADVICE OF HIS LAWYER AND HIS ACCOUNTANT AND RELEASES HIS\nTAXES. I ALSO WOULD LOVE TO TELL YOU,\nI'VE LOOKED AT CNN POLLING, EVERYBODY'S POLLING, OUR OWN\nPOLLING I CAN'T FIND WHERE THIS IS A BURNING ISSUE TO MOST OF\nTHE AMERICANS. IT GOES BACK TO WHAT HILLARY\nCLINTON SAID. TO BE SO DISMISSIVE OF TENS OF\nMILLIONS OF AMERICANS ALSO MEANS THAT PEOPLE -- PEOPLE AROUND\nHERE AND ELSEWHERE THINK THAT SOMEHOW THE ISSUES THAT ARE\nVEXING AMERICANS ARE NOT ECONOMY, JOBS, TERRORISM, HEALTH\nCARE, IMMIGRATION, EDUCATION. EXACTLY WHAT WE TELL THE CNN\nPOLLSTERS. WHY DON'T WE HAVE A DISCUSSION\nABOUT THAT? WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT TAXES?\nWHAT WILL OUR TAX BURDEN BE UNDER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP?\nHE HAS GIVEN A 4 OR 5 POINT MIDDLE CLASS TAX RELIEF PLAN.\nWE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT TAX REFORM IN PENNSYLVANIA.\nACTUALLY, A VERY EXCITING ASPECT OF IT.\nTHEN HE'LL BE AT THE ECONOMIC -- >> THE ISSUE GOES TO\nTRANSPARENCY. THE ISSUE GOES TO TRANSPARENCY\nAND IF VOTERS CAN BANK ON WHAT THEY ARE VOTING ON AND KNOWING\nYOUR CANDIDATE. FOR INSTANCE, MIKE PENCE, VP\nNOMINEE, SAID YESTERDAY THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS GIVEN AWAY TENS\nOF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO CHARITY, BUT INVESTIGATIONS\nCAN'T FIND HIS PERSONAL MONEY THAT HAS -- IS IN THE TENS OF\nMILLIONS. DO YOU STAND BY THE TENS OF\nMILLIONS NUMBER? >> DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN\nINCREDIBLY GENEROUS OVER THE COURSE OF HIS OWN LIFE?\n>> WITH HIS OWN MONEY WHICH IS HIS MONEY.\n>> NO, THE FOUNDATION'S MONEY ARE OTHER PEOPLE'S.\n>> OKAY. HE'S BEEN INCREDIBLY GENEROUS.\n>> ARE WE GOING TO ACTUALLY QUESTION HILLARY CLINTON AND HER\nHUSBAND MADE ALMOST A QUARTER OF A BILLION AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO\nJUST QUESTION -- AND THAT'S OKAY.\nIT'S OKAY THAT -- >> BUT WHY ISN'T HE A\nBILLIONAIRE. DONALD TRUMP HAS TAUTED IT TOO.\nWHY IS THAT A SHORT COMING? >> EXCUSE ME?\nIT'S NOT A SHORT COMING. I'M A CAPITALIST.\nI WISH SHE WOULD RESPECT THE HARD WORKING MEN AND WOMEN WHO\nSHE THINKS ARE UNEDUCATED RUDES COMING DOWN FROM THE HILLS.\nTHEY NEED TO BE SCHOOLED BY THIS PRECIOUS WOMAN IN NEW YORK AT\nTIPRIANNI WHO ARE LAUGHING AT AMERICANS.\nDO WE REALLY WANT A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO LAUGHS AT\nAMERICANS? I DON'T.\nI FIND IT DISGRACEFUL. I GREW UP AROUND LABOR BORE\nLISTS. I THINK HER INSULTING TENS OF\nMILLIONS OF AMERICANS JUST BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A YALE\nLAW DEGREE LIKE SHE DOES, JUST BECAUSE THEIR HUSBAND DOESN'T\nMAKE A HALF MILLION TO GIVE A SPEECH 45 MINUTES SOMEWHERE,\nJUST BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GIVE MINERAL RIGHTS TO THEIR FRIENDS\nIN FAR AWAY COUNTRIES WHEN THEY ARE SECRETARY OF STATE AND THE\nOTHER PART OF HER COMMENT WAS ALSO OFFENSIVE.\nLET'S TALK ABOUT THE OTHER HALF OF THE HALF, ALISYN SAYING\nPEOPLE ARE DESPERATE FOR CHANGE. BOY, DO I AGREE WITH HER.\nVERY DESPERATE FOR CHANGE. WHO'S BEEN IN CHARGE OF THE\nECONOMY FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS.\n>> PART OF WHY PEOPLE ARE CALLING FOR HIM TO RELEASE HIS\nTAXES SO WE DO KNOW HOW MUCH HE HIMSELF HAS GIVEN TO CHARITY.\nWILL YOU OR THE CAMPAIGN RELEASE EXACTLY WHAT THAT NUMBER IS?\nAND THE REASON I ASK -- >> I DOUBT IT.\n>> WHY WOULD YOU DOUBT IT? >> I DOUBT IT.\nTHIS IS LIKE BADGERING. I DON'T SEE IT AS JOURNALISM, I\nSEE IT AS BADGERING. WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION SO\nMANY DIFFERENT TIMES ON SO MANY DIFFERENT NETWORKS YET WE'RE NOT\nHAVING CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT THE MIDDLE CLASS TAX RELIEF\nWOULD MEAN FOR PEOPLE'S WAGE STAGNATION.\n>> WE DO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AT OTHER TIMES BUT HOW IS IT\nBADGERING TO ASK FOR THE EVIDENCE OF A CLAIM?\nIF MIKE PENCE IS SAYING TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM DONALD\nTRUMP, SHOULDN'T WE SEE THE EVIDENCE?\n>> DID ANYBODY ASK HILLARY CLINTON FOR EVIDENCE THAT SHE\nWAS OVER HEATED AND DEHYDRATED? IS ANYBODY ASKING HER FOR\nEVIDENCE OF WHY SHE THINKS SHE'S SO PRECIOUS AND SPECIAL THAT SHE\nWOULD HAVE THE SECRET SERVICE BREAK PROTOCOL AT GROUND ZERO ON\nSUNDAY, ALISYN, AND TAKE HER TO HER DAUGHTER'S APARTMENT RATHER\nTHAN A HOSPITAL? WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE.\nTHIS NETWORK AND OTHER NETWORKS WHERE PRESUMPTIVELY PROTECTING\nHER -- >> THAT'S NOT FAIR, KELLYANNE.\nANDERSON COOPER GOT THE EXCLUSIVE.\nI DON'T BUY THAT. WE ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS OF THE\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN BUT WHEN YOU'RE HERE REPRESENTING THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN WE ASK THESE QUESTIONS. YOU CAN'T MAKE CLAIMS AND EXPECT\nEVERYONE TO ACCEPT IT. SO THE IDEA THAT --\n>> I THINK DONALD TRUMP'S A VERY GENEROUS MAN.\n>> YES, AND WHAT'S THE EVIDENCE? >> TO HAVE EMPLOYED TENS OF\nTHOUSANDS OF PEOPLE FROM MANY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, BOTH\nGENDERS CERTAINLY, FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE.\nOVER THE YEARS. >> SURE, BUT THAT'S NOT CHARITY.\nEMPLOYMENT IS NOT CHARITY. >> IT'S PRETTY DARN IMPRESSIVE\nAND IT ISN'T THE POLITICAL RESUME THAT HIS OPPONENT HAS.\nI WOULD RESPECTFULLY PLAY. WE LOVE TO PLAY A PARLOR GAME AT\nTRUMP TOWERS. IT TAKES THE AVERAGE CLINTON\nSURROGATE OR CAMPAIGN STAFFER TEN SECONDS OR TEN WORDS TO TALK\nABOUT DONALD TRUMP WHEN YOU ASK THEM A QUESTION ABOUT HILLARY\nCLINTON AND I CAN'T BLAME THEM. IF SHE WERE MY CANDIDATE, I\nWOULDN'T WANT TO TALK MUCH ABOUT HER EITHER.\n>> BUT YOU ARE TALKING A LOT ABOUT HER.\n>> YOU'RE DARN RIGHT. SO AT LEAST WE HEAR ABOUT HER\nTODAY. TRANSPARENCY AND TRUSTWORTHINESS\nARE HER TWO PILLAR PROBLEMS AND SHE DID NOTHING THE WHOLE LAST\nWEEK. I THINK SHE HAD A TERRIBLE WEEK.\nSHE CERTAINLY HAD A TERRIBLE WEEKEND.\nNOT BECAUSE SHE'S SICK. LET ME REPEAT.\nWE'RE GLAD SHE SAID SHE'S FEELING BETTER.\nWE HOPE SHE'S FULLY RECOVERING AND COMES BACK TO THE CAMPAIGN\nTRAIL. WHY THE CONCEALMENT?\nWHAT'S THE BIG DEAL JUST TO SAY, I HAVE PNEUMONIA AND I'M ON\nANTIBIOTICS. WHY DIDN'T SHE TELL HER RUNNING\nMATE. WHAT AN EMBARRASSMENT FOR HIM TO\nCOME OUT. TUESDAY I READ ON THE HILL, SHE\nDOECHT NEED TO APOLOGIZE FOR HER COMMENT.\nIT'S SO ODD THEY CAN'T LET THE RUNNING MATE KNOW WHAT'S GOING\nON. WHY IS THAT?\n>> SHOULD DONALD TRUMP'S RUNNING MATE MIKE PENCE HAVE SAID THAT\nDAVID DUKE IS DEPLORABLE? >> HE SHOULD -- SURE.\nSO THAT -- SO THAT HE DOESN'T GET HEADLINES SAYING MIKE PENCE\nWILL NOT SAY DONALD TRUMP IS DEPLORABLE AND PEOPLE CAN GET\nSATISFIED? CAN PEOPLE PLAY THE ENTIRE CLIP.\nTHANK YOU FOR PLAYING THAT ENTIRE CLIP.\nWE DON'T WANT TO SUPPORT. WE DON'T LIKE WHAT HE STANDS FOR\nOR PEOPLE STAND FOR IN THE KKK. HE HAS ANOTHER POIBL.\nTHERES A CERTAIN OBSESSION ABOUT CONSTANTLY RAISING ISSUES AND\nRAISING PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT PART OF OUR CAMPAIGN THAT WE HAVE\nSAID AND REINCE PRIEBUS, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN\nNATIONAL COMMITTEE HAS SAID, WE DON'T WANT HIS SUPPORT.\nWE DON'T WANT PEOPLE LIKE THAT. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.\nWILL HILLARY CLINTON DISAVOW -- DOES SHE THINK KERMIT GOSSELIN\nIS DEPLORABLE? KILLING BLACK BABIES IN\nPHILADELPHIA. DOES SHE THINK PEOPLE CALLING\nCOPS PIGS IN A BLANKET AND ASKING FOR THEIR DEATH\nDEPLORABLE? I SHOULD DO.\nWE CAN GO NAME AFTER NAME. I'LL SIT HERE BETWEEN NOW AND\nELECTION DAY. WE WON'T GET TO THE TENS OF\nMILLIONS OF PEOPLE HILLARY CLINTON WAS REFERRING TO BY\nCALLING THEM DEPLORABLE. SHE WAS REFERRING TO HARD\nWORKING MEN AND WOMEN. IT WASN'T A GAFFE.\nPLEASE, PRINT JOURNALISTS, STOP CALLING IT A GAFFE.\nSHE WAS READING IT FROM PREPARED REMARKS AS SHE ALWAYS DOES.\n>> KELLYANNE ARE YOU SATISFIED ABOUT THE LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY\nFROM YOUR CANDIDATE? >> I AM REALLY SATISFIED WITH\nIT. I AM SATISFIED THAT HE IS OUT\nTHERE WITH VOTERS EVERY DAY. THEY EXPECT HIM.\nTHEY DESERVE IT. I TRAVEL WITH HIM.\nTHE COUNTY FAIR HE AND GOVERNOR PENCE WERE TOGETHER IN OHIO.\nIT WAS ASTONISHING TO SEE PEOPLE EIGHT AND TEN DEEP AT A COUNTY\nFAIR TO SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, THEY DON'T SAY MAY I HAVE YOUR\nAUTOGRAPH, THEY SAY I LOVE YOU, WILL YOU SAVE MY COUNTRY.\nTHEY SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING THE SACRIFICE OF RUNNING.\nYOU KNOW WHAT I APPRECIATE, I APPRECIATE THAT I'M RUNNING FOR\nA PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WHO'S NOT A POLITICIAN, WHO DID NOT\nNEED TO DO THIS. PEOPLE IN POLITICS RUN FOR FAME,\nFORTUNE, STATUS, HE HAD ALL OF THAT.\nHE HAS ALL OF THAT. IT'S A TREMENDOUS SACRIFICE FOR\nHE AND HIS FAMILY TO DO THAT. THAT'S ONE OF THE UNTOLD\nSTORIES. WHO THINKS THEY'VE EARNED IT,\nDESERF IT, IT'S THEIR TURN. DARN IT, YOU BETTER GET BEHIND\nME. I'M QUALIFIED.\nYOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS A QUALIFICATION?\nINTEGRITY AND TRANSPARENCY. >> YES, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT\nTRANSPARENCY, A LOT THIS MORNING, AND DEMANDING IT FROM\nBOTH CANDIDATES. >> THANK YOU.\n>> THANKS FOR BEING HERE. >> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.\n>> LET'S GET THE OTHER SIDE. JOINING US NOW IS CLINTON\nSUPPORTER AND FORMER NATO SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER GENERAL\nWESLEY CORK. ALWAYS A PLEASURE.\nI DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE MILITARY SPECIFICALLY.\nTHE CAMPAIGN, WE WERE TRYING TO GET THEM ON TO COUNTER WHAT'S\nOUT THERE RIGHT NOW IN THE STATE OF PLAY AND WE GOT YOU SO I'VE\nGOT TO PUT TWO HATS ON YOU THIS MORNING.\nIS THAT OKAY? >> FINE.\nI'M NOT WORKING WITH THE CAMPAIGN ON THESE ISSUES.\n>> RIGHT. >> BUT I'M A VERY ACTIVE\nSUPPORTER OF HILLARY CLINTON. I'VE KNOWN HER FOR YEARS.\nI THINK SHE HAS HIGH INTEGRITY. I THINK SHE'LL BE A GREAT\nPRESIDENT. WE HAVE TO GET HER INTO OFFICE.\n>> KELLYANNE CONWAY USED AN INTERESTING WORD, FURTIVE.\nDO YOU THINK THAT APPLIES TO HILLARY CLINTON?\n>> ABSOLUTELY NOT. EVERY PERSON WHEN YOU GET UP IN\nTHE MORNING, IS THIS GOING TO BE A GOOD DAY, A BAD DAY, HOW DO\nYOU FEEL? WHEN YOU'RE IN A POLITICAL\nCAMPAIGN YOU'RE USUALLY TIRED. MAYBE DONALD TRUMP ISN'T TIRED\nBECAUSE HE'S COMING BACK TO NEW YORK AND TAKING IT EASY EVERY\nNIGHT. THAT'S WHAT WE HEAR.\nBUT HILLARY CLINTON'S WORKED HER REAR END OFF FOR THE LAST YEAR\nAND A HALF ON THIS CAMPAIGN AND I KNOW I DID THIS FOR FIVE\nMONTHS. I KNOW HOW TIRED I WAS AND I\nKNOW SHE'S TIRED. AND SO SHE'S NOT GOING TO GET UP\nEVERY MORNING, GEE, TODAY I FEEL 86% TIRED.\nYESTERDAY I WAS 84% TIRED. AND SHE'S NOT GOING TO SAY THOSE\nTHINGS. SO OF COURSE SHE TRIED TO POWER\nTHROUGH THIS. >> YOU'VE MAINTAINED MILITARY\nDISCIPLINE. YOU'RE IN GREAT SHAPE.\nDON'T YOU THINK THESE CANDIDATES SHOULD BE MORE FORTHCOMING ABOUT\nTHEIR MEDICAL HISTORY GIVEN THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE THE MOST\nPOWERFUL PERSON IN THE WORLD? >> SHE'LL RELEASE HER MEDICAL\nRECORDS, BUT I THINK MR. TRUMP REALLY OUGHT TO BE MORE\nFORTHCOMING ABOUT HIS TAX RETURNS AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY.\nTHIS IS THE BIGGEST ISSUE. BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE PRESIDENT OF\nTHE UNITED STATES THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT YOU TO HAVE ONE\nOVERRIDING INTEREST AND PRIORITY AND THAT'S THE GOOD OF THE\nCOUNTRY. AND WHEN I RAN FOR OFFICE I HAD\nTO GIVE UP ALL MY BOARDS, ALL MY PAID ENGAGEMENTS, EVERYTHING.\nSO THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO PERCEPTION, NO CHANCE OF A\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST. TRUMP'S STILL IN BUSINESS.\nWE KNOW FROM RIDING THE RECORDS A LOT OF THOSE BUSINESSES HAVE\nHAD RUSSIAN MONEY IN THEM APPARENTLY.\nAND MAYBE THE RUSSIANS HAVE LOANED HIM MONEY.\nIF IT'S A LOT OF MONEY, MAYBE IT STAYS UP TO MR. PUTIN.\nWE DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS CONNECTIONS ARE WITH RUSSIA.\nAS SOMEONE WHO SERVED IN THE MILITARY SINCE THE 1960s AND WAS\nTHERE DURING THE COLD WAR, I WAS THE NATO COMMANDER TURNED OUT WE\nHAD A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH RUSSIA DURING THE OPERATION TO\nSTOP ETHNIC CLEANSING IN KOSOVO. WHAT IS THE CONNECTION?\nWHERE ARE MR. TRUMP'S LOYALTIES AND IF HE WANTS TO CLEAR THOSE\nUP, HE NEEDS TO RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS.\n>> HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS HE HAS THE BIGGEST ADVANTAGE IN BEING\nPRESIDENT VERSUS HILLARY CLINTON WHEN IT COMES TO INTEGRITY.\nDO YOU ACCEPT THAT GIVEN THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT\nRIGHT NOW AND ABOUT PUTIN BEING A BETTER LEADER THAN OBAMA.\nDO YOU BELIEVE THAT'S HIM BEING A TRUTH TELLER?\nDO YOU BELIEVE THAT GIVES HIM THE ADVANTAGE OF INTEGRITY?\n>> LET'S LOOK AT MR. PUTIN FIRST, THE FACTS.\nTHIS IS A GUY WHO JAILS HIS OPPONENTS, KEEPS THEM OUT OF\nCONGRESS. PEOPLE GET KILLED.\nMAYBE HE'S WORTH $200 BILLION. HOW DO YOU MAKE $200 BILLION IF\nYOU'RE THE LEADER OF A COUNTRY? SO WHAT KIND OF INTEGRITY IS\nTHAT ON THE PART OF MR. PUTIN. THEN IF YOU'RE THE PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATE, HE'S A GREAT LEADER BUT HE'S CERTAINLY NOT THE KIND\nOF LEADER AMERICA WANTS. YOU BELIEVE HE'S GOT 82% -- IF I\nWERE IN RUSSIA I'D SAY PUTIN WAS A GREAT LEADER, TOO, BECAUSE I\nWOULDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER AND I'D BE AFRAID.\nIT'S ABOUT INTEGRITY. IT'S ALSO ABOUT JUDGMENT AND\nIT'S ABOUT HIDDEN MOTIVES. THAT'S FINE COMING BACK TO THE\nTAX ISSUE. YOU WON'T RELEASE YOUR TAX\nRETURNS, CHRIS, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING\nWHAT ARE THE OTHER POLLS ON YOU? HE SHOULD BE OUT OF HIS\nBUSINESS. MR. TRUMP SHOULD BE SAYING,\nLOOK, I WANT TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nHERE'S MY TAX RETURNS. LOOK AT THEM.\n>> AND THE CRITICISM OF CLINTON ON THE SAME LEVEL OF\nTRANSPARENCY IS WE ONLY KNOW THINGS WHEN CONGRESS\nINVESTIGATES, OTHERWISE THE CAMPAIGN OR HILLARY CLINTON\nHERSELF OR THE CLINTONS TOGETHER WON'T LET YOU KNOW THINGS THAT\nDO SPEAK TO THE INTEGRITY OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN\nLEADERSHIP, I.E.,, AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE SAW WITH THE FOUNDATION.\n>> WAIT A MINUTE WAIT A MINUTE. I'VE BEEN WITH THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION AND THE CLINTON GLOBAL INITIATIVE SINCE IT\nSTARTED. I'VE BEEN TO EVERYONE OF THESE\nMEETINGS, I'VE MET ALL OF THESE PEOPLE.\nIT'S A WONDERFUL GATHERING OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO DO THINGS\nTOGETHER TO CHANGE THE WORLD AND IT'S PUT TENS OF MILLIONS OF\nDOLLARS INTO THINGS LIKE HEALTH CARE AND CHILDREN'S EDUCATION.\n>> AND TREATMENT FOR 2/3 WHO RECEIVE IT.\n>> BILL CLINTON GETS NOTHING FROM TNCHTS THERE ARE DIFFERENT\nARMS TO IT. IF YOU WERE SECRETARY OF STATE\nWOULD YOU HAVE HAD THAT KIND OF CONNECTION ACCEPTING MONEY FROM\nFOREIGN ACTORS THE WAY IT WAS WITH CLINTONS.\n>> HILLARY CLINTON WAS SECRETARY OF STATE, BILL CLINTON WAS\nRUNNING THE FOUNDATION. SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO\nWITH THE FOUNDATION OTHER THAN COMING THERE AT THE CLINTON\nGLOBAL INITIATIVE ONCE OR TWICE OR GIVING A SPEECH.\n>> YOU WOUND UP HAVING THE SAME PEOPLE IN BOTH PLACES, RIGHT?\n>> THOSE PEOPLE WERE NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS AND THEY WEREN'T DOING\nBUSINESS WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE COME IN AND TALK TO PEOPLE IN THE STATE\nDEPARTMENT. THAT AP STORY YOU'RE REFERRING\nTO, CHRIS, EVERYBODY WHO'S LOOKED AT THAT STORY SAID THE\nHEADLINES WERE -- >> THEY OVER REACHED.\n>> THEY PULLED IT BACK. >> ABSOLUTELY.\nIT DOESN'T MEAN THE QUESTIONS DON'T EXIST, THAT'S WHY I'M\nASKING YOU, GENERAL. ALSO, THE IDEA OF --\n>> I THINK THE ANSWER TO THOSE QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN OUT THERE.\nTHEY'VE BEEN SET ASIDE. I MEAN, IT'S TIME TO MOVE PAST\nTHOSE QUESTIONS. I WANT TO GET BACK TO THE REAL\nISSUES OF THE CAMPAIGN. AS AN AMERICAN I WANT TO KNOW\nWHAT THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY LOOKS LIKE AND WHAT WE'VE HAD\nFROM MR. TRUMP IS NOT A REAL COHERENT VIEW OF FOREIGN POLICY\nAND THE ECONOMIC PROGRAM, THEY JUST DON'T MAKE SENSE.\nHE TALKS ABOUT TAX CUTS. LET'S TALK ABOUT TAX CUTS.\nWHEN KENNEDY CUT TAXES IN 19 -- IN THE EARLY 1960s, THE TOP\nMARGINAL TAX RATE WAS 91%. HE CUT IT TO 70.\nTHAT'S A LOT DIFFERENT THAN WE ARE TODAY.\nWE'RE ALREADY RUNNING A BUDGET DEFICIT.\nWE'VE GOT OUR MILITARY THAT THE MONEY IS SEE QUESTERED IN THERE.\nTHE MILITARY NEEDS MORE FUNDS. YOU CAN'T KEEP CUTTING TAXES,\nDON'T WORRY, IT'S MAGIC. THE ECONOMY WILL GROW.\nWHY IS MR. TRUMP REPEATING THE SAME OLD TIRED FORMULA THAT\nWE'VE DISPROVED TIME AND AGAIN. IT DOESN'T WORK.\nWHEN YOU TAKE THESE BIG TAX CUTS LIKE PRESIDENT GEORGE W BUSH DID\nIN 2003 AND SAY, THIS IS YOUR MONEY, I'M GIVING IT BACK TO\nYOU, DON'T WORRY, YOUR ECONOMY WILL OUT GROW IT.\nYOU'LL GET MORE TAX RETURNS. NICE THEORY.\nDOESN'T WORK. DISPROVED BY ALL THE FACTS.\nLET'S MOVE FORWARD, ASK THE CANDIDATES THEIR REAL PLANS.\nI THINK HILLARY HAS A REAL PLAN. THE INVESTMENT AND\nINFRASTRUCTURE IS WHAT THIS COUNTRY REALLY NEEDS.\n>> BOTH CANDIDATES HAVE PLANS FOR THAT, THE QUESTION IS WHICH\nONE CAN GET IT DONE. THAT IS A CERTAINLY LEGITIMATE\nBASIS OF APPRAISAL. CHARACTER COUNTS, GENERAL CLARK,\nTHANK YOU FOR MAKING THE CAMPAIGN FOR THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN THIS MORNING. APPRECIATE IT.\n>>> FORMER PRESIDENT BILL",

FOR HILLARY CLINTON TO EXPRESS\nSUCH DISDAIN FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICANS I THINK IS ONE MORE\nREASON THAT DISQUALIFIES HER TO SERVE IN THE HIGHEST OFFICE OF\nTHE LAND. >> HE ALSO CALLED HER COMMENTS\nCATASTROPHIC. >> OUTSIDE PHILLY IS WHERE TRUMP\nHAS A SPEECH SCHEDULED FOR THIS EVENING.\nI GUESS IT'S COME TO THIS, KARL, IT'S ALL DOWN THERE.\n>> Reporter: PNEUMONIA VERSUS DEPLORABLE.\nNOT EXACTLY. TRUMP HAS BEEN STEERING CLEAR OF\nHILLARY CLINTON'S ILL HEALTH. BUT, ONLY RHETORICALLY, IN FACT\nWHAT HE'S BEEN DOING SINCE SHE TOOK SICK, HE HAS BEEN POUNDING\nHER HORRIBLY PARTICULARLY ON THE DEPLORABLES.\nSHE IS NOT OUT HERSELF AND THE PRESIDENT IS A PRETTY GOOD PROXY\nAND TIM KAINE TRIES BUT PRETTY MUCH THE WAY PENCE HAS A HARD\nTIME FIT INTO THE SHOOTS OF DONALD TRUMP IT IS HARD FOR HIM.\nTRUMP CONTINUES TO HAMMER IT. HIS AIDES HAVE MADE IT VERY\nCLEAR THAT WHILE SHE'S AT HOME RECUPERATING HE HAS AN\nOPPORTUNITY TO TRY TO TATTOO HER WITH THIS PERHAPS INDELIBLY,\nEVERY SINGLE DAY COUNTS. THESE ARE A CRUCIAL FOUR DAYS.\n>> HE REALLY NEEDS WOMEN AND TONIGHT HE'S GOING TALK ABOUT\nCHILD CARE. DO WE KNOW ANY DETAILS ON WHAT'S\nCOMING THERE? >> Reporter: THERE ARE A NUMBER\nOF THINGS THAT HE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT.\nTHIS IS SOMETHI GUN TO TALK ABOUT IN THE INNER -- BEGUN\nTO TALK ABOUT IN THE INNER CITIES.\nHE WOULD CREATE A DEPENDENT SAVINGS ACCOUNT TO PUT MONEY\nAWAY FOR TAX DEDUCTION AND USE IT FOR CHILD CARE OR ELDER CARE\nIF YOU HAVE A SENIOR IN THE HOUSE, IT'S A WAY TO SAVE MONEY.\nTHERE WOULD ALSO BE A CHILD SAVINGS ACCOUNT WHERE FAMILIES\nCOULD GET TAX DEDUCTIONS FOR VIRTUALLY EVERY SINGLE CHILD\nEXPENSE, THAT, TOO WOULD BE TAX   IT'S EXPENSIVE.\nAND HE WOULD MAKE MATERNITY LEAVE PAID FOR SIX WEEKS AND\nESSENTIALLY CHANGE UNEMPLOYMENT RULES SO SOME OF THAT MONEY\nCOULD BE USED TO PROVIDE MATERNITY CARE FOR MOM ON SIX\nWEEKS OF PAID LEAVE. THIS IS A LOT OF SOCIAL\nSPENDING. A LOT OF VERY GOOD SOCIAL\nPROGRAMS THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO THINK WOW, THAT'S GREAT FOR\nME, MY NEIGHBORS BUT NOT FOR THE BUDGET AND FISCAL CONSERVATIVES\nIN WASHINGTON HAVE BEEN AGAINST IT WITH SHUT DOWN POLITICS AND\nFISCAL CLIFFS IT IS HARD TO PICTURE SOCIAL SPENDING, BUT\nTRUMP IS BRINGING HIS DAUGHTER ALONG, PARTICULARLY CHILD CARE\nISSUES, VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO HER AND THERE'S A DISTINCT\nPOSSIBILITY THAT SHE WILL NOT JUST JUMP ON THE STAGE AND WAVE\nBUT WILL MAKE SOME REMARKS",

DONALD TRUMP IS 70.\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS A COMPLICATED MEDICAL HISTORY.\nAND I THINK THAT GIVEN THAT CASE, WE OUGHT TO KNOW MORE.\nAND I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, WE FELL DOWN ON THE JOB, I WOULD\nARGUE NOW LOOKING BACK ON IT WITH BARACK OBAMA, WHO WAS YOUNG\nAND VIGOROUS WHEN HE RAN, WE DIDN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT HIS\nHEALTH EITHER. AND MITT ROMNEY, 65 YEARS OLD,\nYOU KNOW THE PICTURE OF HEALTH, WE DIDN'T KNOW MUCH BEYOND A\nDOCTOR'S LETTER EITHER. I THINK THAT WE SHOULD KNOW\nMORE. >> DO YOU THINK WE WILL KNOW\nMORE LATER, THIS WEEK WHEN HILLARY CLINTON'S MEDICAL REPORT\nCOMES OUT, BE IT WILL DETAILED SPECIFIC WITH A LOT MORE\nINFORMATION, WILL WE KNOW A LOT MORE ABOUT HIS HEALTH WHEN HE\nRELEASES THE RESULTS OF HIS PHYSICAL?\n>> WE'LL KNOW MORE THAN WE KNOW TODAY, THAT'S FOR SURE.\nI DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH MORE, BUT WE DO KNOW THAT DONALD TRUMP\nSAID HE HAD A PHYSICAL, A COMPLETE PHYSICAL LAST WEEK.\nHILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER SAID SHE'S EXPECTED TO\nHAVE A COMPLETE PHYSICAL THIS WEEK.\nTHE RESULTS OF THEIR CURRENT STATE OF THEIR HEALTH WILL COME\nOUT IN SOME MORE DETAIL THAN WE HAVE FROM EITHER ONE OF THEM\nTHAT'S A GOOD THING. I DO THINK WE ARE AT THIS PHASE\nNOW WHERE THESE CANDIDATES ARE REALLY TRYING TO CLOSE A SALE\nWITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. I THINK AMERICAN PUB HICK HAS TO\nBE ABLE TO ASSESS WHAT THEY'RE PURCHASING IN THIS.\nAND I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT. >> I AGREE WITH THAT.\nI JUST THINK IF THAT'S THE STANDARD, WE HAVE TO DO A BETTER\nJOB. IF IT'S A MARCO RUBIO RUNS FOR\nPRESIDENT, THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE SAME SCRUTINY.\n>> I AGREE. AND I AGREE THAT THE KIND OF\nSCRUTINY SHOULD BE ON YOUR TAX RETURNS, AS WELL AS ON YOUR\nHOUSE. AND THERE IS NOT AN EQUIVALENCY\nTHERE BETWEEN WHAT HILLARY CLINTON AND DISCLOSED AND WHAT\nDONALD TRUMP HAS DISCLOSED, YOU KNOW, BEYOND HIS ELECTION\nRECORDS. >> YOU GUYS IN THE NEWS MEDIA,\nHE'S SAYING YOU'RE THE ONLY ONES INTERESTED.\nIT NEVER COMES UP ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\nNOBODY IS INTERESTED. YOU MAKE THIS A BIG ISSUE.\nWHAT IS YOUR ANSWER? >> WE ARE INTERESTED IN THIS ON\nBEHALF OF THE AMERICAN VOTERS.

JUST THAT ONE LITTLE SHOCKER AT\nTHE END OF WHAT HILLARY CLINTON SAID SHOULD REALLY SET EVERYBODY\nON EDGE. 120 FOREIGN DEALS.\nDEALS WITH WHO? I MEAN, HIS MOST LUCRATIVE REAL\nESTATE DEAL I THINK ASIDE FROM TRUMP TOWER IN NEW YORK CITY IS\n40 WALL STREET. WE DON'T KNOW WHO HE CO-OWNS 40\nWALL STREET WITH. I MEAN, THIS IS REALLY, REALLY\nBASIC STUFF AND IT SHOULD BE STARTLING TO PEOPLE THAT HE WILL\nNOT TELL US WHO HE CO-OWNS BUSINESSES WITH, WHO HE OWES HIS\nESTIMATED $650 MILLION TO, HIS BUSINESSES ARE CARRYING A LOT OF\nDEBT. HE'S DOING OVER 100 FOREIGN\nDEALS AND HE WANTS TO BE BOTH THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND THE\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE WORLD FOR THE UNITED STATES.\nIT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE AS FAR AS -- YOU KNOW, I MEAN, THE DIFFERENCE\nBETWEEN TELLING SOMEBODY YOU HAD PNEUMONIA ON SUNDAY INSTEAD OF\nFRIDAY IS NOT EVEN IN THE SAME LEAGUE REALLY.\n>> WELL, DAVID, WE DO KNOW THAT CLINTON DID RELEASE HER TAXES\nFOR THE PAST 40 YEARS. WE KNOW SHE TAKES BLOOD\nTHINNERS, THAT SHE HAD A CONCUSSION, THAT SHE TAKES\nTHYROID MEDICATION. SHE EVEN TALKED TO CNN ABOUT\nMONICA LEWINSKY. WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HIS\nMEDICAL HISTORY, HIS TAX RETURNS OR HIS MARRIAGE.\nDO YOU AGREE WITH ERROLL? >> WELL, I CERTAINLY AGREE THAT\nDONALD TRUMP HAS NOT BEEN AS TRANSPARENT ABOUT HIS HEALTH\nRECORDS, RIGHT? HIS DOCTOR RELEASED THAT LETTER\nTHAT EVERYONE HAS TALKED ABOUT THAT SAID HE'S THE HEALTHIEST\nINDIVIDUAL EVER HE LEEKTED TO THE PRESIDENCY WHICH I THINK IS\nALMOST CARTOONISH IN ITS DESCRIPTION OF DONALD TRUMP.\nDONALD TRUMP SHOULD LEASE MOR ROBUST AND MORE COMPLETE HEALTH\nRECORDS. SECRETARY CLINTON SHOULD RELEASE\nMORE ROBUST AND MORE COMPLETE HEALTH RECORDS IF THAT'S WHAT\nTHE PUBLIC DEMANDS. I THINK IT'S REASONABLE FOR THE\nPUBLIC TO DEMAND THAT WHEN ANYONE SEEKS THE OFFICE OF THE\nPRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES, COMMANDER IN CHIEF, LEADER OF\nTHE FREE WORLD, IF YOU WILL. THAT SAID, I THINK THE STANDARD\nHAS TO BE APPLIED FAIRLY BOTH TO SECRETARY CLINTON AND TO DONALD\nTRUMP, WHICH IT HASN'T SO FAR. I THINK GOING FORWARD IN THE\nFUTURE THE STANDARD CAN'T BE AGEIST, RIGHT?\nJUST BECAUSE SHE'S 69 AND HE'S 70 DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULD PUT\nEXTRA SCRUTINY ON THEM. IF THE OFFICE IS THAT IMPORTANT,\nWHICH IT IS, THEN GOING FORWARD IN THE FUTURE IN 2020 IF A MUCH\nYOUNGER CANDIDATE, SENATOR RUBIO, SENATOR CRUZ RUNS WE\nSHOULD DEMAND THE SAME AMOUNT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR HEALTH\nAS WELL. >> OKAY.\nSO ON THE SUBJECT OF MRS. CLINTON'S PNEUMONIA AND DONALD\nTRUMP'S HEALTH RECORDS, KE KELLYANNE CONWAY WAS ON AND THIS\nIS WHAT SHE SAID ABOUT IT. >> ALISYN, THIS IS WHAT I EXPECT\nFROM THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN. I REALLY DON'T EXPECT IT FROM\nJOURNALISTS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HILLARY\nCLINTON AND HER PNEUMONIA AND WHAT HAPPENED ON 9/11 WHICH WE\nALL SAW WITH OUR OWN TWO EYES. IT TAKES US ABOUT TEN WORDS TO\nGET TO DONALD TRUMP. HE HAD A PHYSICAL LAST WEEK.\nHE'LL RELEASE THEM PROBABLY THIS WEEK OR WHENEVER THE DOCTOR HAS\nTHE REPORT PREPARED. >> SO I WOULD SAY THAT KELLYANNE\nCONWAY DOES NOT AGREE WITH ERROLL OR DAVID AND SHE CAN'T\nBELIEVE THEY'RE SAYING SUCH THINGS.\n>> AND WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH HIM RELEASING WHATEVER\nINFORMATION HE'S GOING TO RELEASE, THESE NUMBERS FROM HIS\nPHYSICAL. PART OF THE INFORMATION IS IT\nDOESN'T TELL YOU MUCH. IT'S JUST A SNAPSHOT OF WHATEVER\nYOUR CHOLESTEROL LEVEL IS OR WHATEVER YOUR HEART RATE IS OR\nYOUR BLOOD PRESSURE. SO THAT'S NOT GOING TO, I THINK,\nGIVE A REALLY COMPLETE PICTURE. I THINK THE STANDARD SHOULD BE\nAS DAVID SAID FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST PEOPLE WHO ARE OVER 65,\nSHOULD BE WHAT JOHN McCAIN, WE SAW HIM DO IN 2008 WHERE PEOPLE\nREALLY HAD A VERY WIDE ACCESS, REPORTERS DID, TO HIS HISTORY OF\nMEDICAL RECORDS AND THEY WERE ABLE TO POUR THROUGH THEM.\nSO THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK WE PROBABLY WON'T SEE.\nWE'LL SEE WHAT HILLARY CLINTON RELEASES IN THE NEXT DAYS, BUT I\nTHINK -- GO AHEAD. >> HERE'S THE OTHER THING THAT I\nFIND INTERESTING. THAT DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO\nAPPEAR ON THE DR. OZ SHOW ON THURSDAY.\nI GUESS THIS WAS PRE-ARRANGED. HE MAY OR MAY NOT TALK ABOUT THE\nRESULTS OF HIS PHYSICAL. THIS IS WHAT DR. OZ SAID ABOUT\nMR. TRUMP'S APPEARANCE YESTERDAY.\n>> HE'S COMING ON THE SHOW, AND I -- YOU KNOW, I KNOW THAT THIS\nHAS BECOME A BIG ISSUE FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES.\nI'VE INVITED BOTH. I KNOW THAT BOTH CANDIDATES ARE\nTALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THEIR HEALTH ISSUES BUT BECAUSE IT'S\nCOME UP IN A BIG CHARGED TOPIC, I THINK IT MAKES SENSE FOR THEM\nTO TALK ABOUT IT. I'M NOT TRYING TO PRY OR PROBE,\nI'M TRYING TO HEAR WHAT'S GOING ON IN THEIR LIVES.\n>> ERROLL, IS THAT A GOOD FORUM FOR DONALD TRUMP TO TALK ABOUT\nHIS HEALTH? BY THE WAY, HIS DAUGHTER IVANKA\nIS GOING TO APPEAR WITH HIM ON THE DR. OZ SHOW.\n>> I DON'T THINK IT'S THE RIGHT FORUM.\nNO DISRESPECT TO DR. OZ WHO PROBABLY MAKES MORE ON THIS SHOW\nTHAN ALL OF US COMBINED BUT I THINK WE JUST SAW IN THE MOST\nRECENT COMMANDER IN CHIEF FORUM WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEONE WHO IS\nNOT AN EXPERIENCED INVESTIGATIVE OR POLITICAL REPORTER TAKES A\nWHACK AT TRYING TO SORT OF GET INFORMATION OUT OF PEOPLE WHO\nARE TRYING TO BE EVASIVE. AND POLITICIANS, ESPECIALLY WHEN\nTHE STAKES ARE HIGH AS THEY ARE RIGHT NOW, CAN BE QUITE EVASIVE.\nI WOULD NOT EXPECT DR. OZ TO ASK THE RIGHT KINDS OF QUESTIONS TO\nGET TO THE BOTTOM OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE.\nAND UNFORTUNATELY I WOULD EXPECT HIM TO GET STEAM ROLLED, TO HAVE\nA BUNCH OF UNCHALLENGED ASSERTIONS TO COME OUT OF THE\nMOUTH OF THE CANDIDATE AND THEN WE'RE LEFT WITH MORE CONFUSION\nAND LESS INFORMATION THAN EVER. I MEAN, I HOPE DR. OZ'S\nPRODUCERS ARE WATCHING THIS AND MAYBE KNOW THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE\nARE RELYING ON THEM TO CARRY SOME IMPORTANT WEIGHT FOR THE\nPUBLIC WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING SOME REALLY IMPORTANT CHOICES IN\nTHE NEXT 50 DAYS. >> SO, DAVID, I CAN HEAR TRUMP\nSUPPORTERS SAYING THINGS LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT, HILLARY CLINTON'S\nTHE ONE WHO GOT SICK ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND SHE GOT\nPNEUMONIA. DONALD TRUMP SEEMS TO BE GOING\nSTRONG. SO WHY ARE WE ALL MAKING SUCH A\nBIG DEAL OF HIM RELEASING HIS MEDICAL RECORDS?\n>> WELL, WE'RE MAKING A BIG DEAL OUT OF IT AGAIN BECAUSE OF WHAT\nWE'VE ALL BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS, THAT\nTHE POSITION OF PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS TOO IMPORTANT\nFOR THE PUBLIC NOT TO HAVE AN IDEA OF THIS PHYSICALLY AND\nMENTALLY FOR ANY OF THE CANDIDATES TO BE ABLE TO DO THE\nJOB OF COMMANDER IN CHIEF IF THEY'RE ELECTED.\nIN TERMS OF THE STANDARD BEING HELD TO SECRETARY CLINTON, THERE\nARE ANY NUMBER OF ISSUES WHERE YOU COULD CRITICIZE SECRETARY\nCLINTON ON THE ISSUE OF TRANSPARENCY.\nTHE WAY SHE TALKED ABOUT THE MISHANDLING OF HER E-MAILS, SOME\nOF THE ISSUES SURROUNDING THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nI HAPPEN TO THINK THE ISSUE OF HER PNEUMONIA IS RELATIVELY LOW\nDOWN ON THAT LIST. A LOT OF JOURNALISTS DISAGREE\nAND REASONABLE MINDS CAN DISAGREE.\nIF SHE GETS A DIAGNOSIS ON FRIDAY THAT SAYS SHE HAS\nPNEUMONIA AND MAKES A DECISION TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE DEBATE, TWO\nMONTHS BEFORE THAT SHE WANTS TO POWER THROUGH AND GO THROUGH THE\n9/11 MEMORIAL, SHE'S ENTITLED TO MAKE THAT DECISION.\nONCE SHE HAD THAT EPISODE AND SHE HAD TO TO GO CHELSEA\nCLINTON'S APARTMENT, YES, IT'S IMPORTANT TO DISCLOSE WHY.\nPEOPLE ARE ASKING AND THEY WANT TO KNOW.\nTHEY CAME OUT A LITTLE TOO LATE TO BE FULLY TRANS PARENT.\nTHEY FIRST SAID SHE WAS OVER HEATED BUT EVENTUALLY SAYING SHE\nHAD PNEUMONIA IF, IN FACT, THAT IS ALL THAT'S AT ISSUE HERE,\nTHEN I THINK THE LESSON LEARNED IS MORE TRANSPARENCY AND MOVE\nFORWARD. >> ALL RIGHT.\nNIA-MALIKA, YOU'RE GOING TO JOIN US NEXT HOUR.\n>>> STILL TO COME IN THE \"NEWSROOM,\" ACCUSATIONS FLY AND\nTEMPERS BOIL OVER AS DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON HEAD\nFOR THE HOME STRETCH.",

BUT THAT'S THE THING READERS ARE\nFIXING ON. >> WHICH MAKES IT A CHALLENGE,\nAS YOU DESCRIBED IN YOUR PIECE, OF COVERING THIS ELECTION.\nLET ME QUOTE YOU. \"IT STRIKES ME THAT TRUMP\nWHETHER HE MEANS TO OR NOT HAS FOSTER ADD HOSTILE MOMENT IN HIS\nPOLITICS WHEN HIS SUPPORTERS FEEL ENTITLED TO RACIALLY\nDENIGRATE OTHERS, SADLY, SIMPLY BEING A GOMEZ IS ENOUGH TO MAKE\nYOU A TARGET.\" LAST QUESTION, HENRY.\nHOW DO YOU THINK THIS ELECTION HAS CHANGED RACE RELATIONS IN\nAMERICA? >> WELL, I THINK YOU NAILED IT\nRIGHT THERE, HIS SUPPORTERS MAY HAVE FELT THIS WAY ALL ALONG BUT\nBECAUSE OF THE THINGS DONALD TRUMP IS SAYING THEY FEEL\nEMPOWERED AND EMBOLDENED TO SAY THIS OUT LOUD OR ATTACK\nSOMEBODY. IT'S NOT JUST REPORTERS, IT'S\nOTHERS, I FEEL THAT'S DIFFERENT. I COVERED THE ELECTION FOUR\nYEARS AGO AND NEVER RECEIVED THIS LEVEL OF VITRIOL FROM MY\nREADERS.

AND HE HAS -- TRUMP HAS BRAGGED\nOR SAID, AT LEAST, THAT HE TRIES VERY HARD TO KEEP HIS TAX RATE\nAS LOW AS POSSIBLE AND WE FIGHT FIND HE'S PAYING A VERY, VERY\nSMALL AMOUNT OF TAX. I THINK THAT'S OF GREAT INTEREST\nTO AMERICAN CITIZENS AS IS IS CHARITABLE GIVING.\n>> AS IS MEDICAL RECORDS AS WELL AS A MEDIA COLUMNIST I'M SURE\nYOU'LL BE WATCHING DR. OZ WITH CLOSER SCRUTINY AS WE KNOW\nDONALD TRUMP HAS CHOSEN THAT AS THE MEDIUM FROM WHICH TO, I\nGUESS, TELL THE WORLD IF HE'S HEALTHY OR NOT.\nWE'LL BE WATCHING.

SHE DIDN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND THE\nBACKLASH UNTIL THE FOLLOWING DAY.\n>> KARINE, I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE COME FORWARD.\nTHE NEXT DAY SHE SAID, LOOK, I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID HATLF.\n>> 60% OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT WAS BORN\nNOT IN THIS COUNTRY, RIGHT? THIS IS WHAT DONALD TRUMP USED\nTO FORAY HIMSELF INTO THE POLITICAL -- IT'S TRUE U.\nIT'S TRUE. THIS IS WHAT THE POLLS SAY.\nIN 2011, THAT'S WHAT DONALD TRUMP USED TO GET INTO THE\nPOLITICAL LANDSCAPE. AND SO THIS IS -- THIS IS THE\nREALITY THAT WE'RE IN NOW. 35% OF VOTERS BELIEVE TRUMP IS A\nRACIST. 56% OF VOTERS BELIEVE THAT HE\nHAS NEGATIVE FEELINGS ABOUT MINORITIES, WOMEN AND\nIMMIGRANTS. >> AND TRUMP IS STILL WINNING\nINDEPENDENTS BY 20 POINTS, TRUMP IS WINNING MARRIED WOMEN BY 10\nPOINTS. HE'S STILL CONTINUING TO WIN\nTHIS ELECTION BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON IS SO UNTRUSTWORTHY.\nSHE TALKED TODAY -- >> THEY'RE BOTH -- I MEAN,\nTHAT'S NOT -- >> -- ABOUT E-MAILS.\nIT'S AMAZING SHE RAISED THAT ISSUE.\nSHE SAID PEOPLE HAVE READ MY E-MAILS.\nTHEY'VE READ NOT THE 15,000 SHE WITHHELD.\n>> THEY CERTAINLY BOTH HAVE ISSUES ON THE QUESTION OF\nTRUST -- >> THAT'S NOT EVEN THE ARGUMENT\nTHERE. LOOK, THE QUESTION I HAVE IS\nWHEN IS DONALD TRUMP GOING TO DISAVOW THE PEOPLE, THE ELEMENT,\nRIGHT, IN HIS CAMPAIGN AND HIS SUPPORTERS THAT ARE DEPLORABLE?\nTHE PEOPLE THAT WE JUST TALKED ABOUT.\nTHE DAVID DUKES OF THE WORLD. >> MIKE PENCE DID THAT TODAY.\n>> THE WHITE SUPREMACISTS. >> MIKE PENCE DID THAT TODAY AND\nDONALD TRUMP HAS DONE IT ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS.\nUNLESS YOU'RE CALLING MIKE PENCE A RACIST, WHICH I DON'T THINK\nYOU ARE -- >> I NEVER SAID THAT.\nI NEVER SAID THAT. DAVID DUKE WHO IS A FORMER GRAND\nWIZARD OF THE KKK THAT TERRORIZED --\n>> HE HAS SAID HE -- >> YEAH, BUT HE IS DEPLORABLE.\nTHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE. DAVID DUKE IS ACTUALLY\nDEPLORABLE. THE KKK IS DEPLORABLE.\nWHITE SUPREMACY -- ROBERT BYRD APOLOGIZED.\nHE APOLOGIZED. >> OKAY TO SAY I'M SORRY.\n>> WE GOT TO LEAVE IT THERE. EVERYBODY, THANK YOU.\n>>> JUST AHEAD, THE PAST COUPLE DAYS UNDERSCORED SOMETHING\nHILLARY CLINTON, DONALD TRUMP HAVE IN COMMON, NEITHER TRAVELS\nWITH A PROTECTED POOL, A GROUP",

THIS AS TRUMP RUNNING MATE MIKE\nPENCE REFUSES TO CALL FORMER KKK LEADER DAVID DUKE DEPLORABLE.\nSUNLEN SERFATY IS LIVE IN WASHINGTON WITH MORE.\n>> Reporter: WELL, THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN THERE REALLY TRYING TO\nKEEP THE SPOTLIGHT VERY SQUARELY FOCUSED ON HILLARY CLINTON'S\nGAFFE. TRUMP ELEVATING THIS ONE STEP\nFARTHER AT HIS RALLY LAST NIGHT WHERE HE CALLED A GROUP OF\nSUPPORTERS UP ON TO STAGE TO GIVE SOMEWHAT OF TESTIMONIALS AS\nTO WHY THEY THINK THEY'RE NOT DEPLORABLE.\nHERE'S DONALD TRUMP LAST NIGHT. >> AFTER MONTHS OF HIDING FROM\nTHE PRESS, HILLARY CLINTON CAME OUT AND FINALLY TOLD THE WORLD\nHOW SHE FEELS ABOUT THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY.\nSHE SAID TENS OF MILLIONS OF PATRIOTIC AMERICANS ARE A BASKET\nOF DEPLORABLES. HOW CAN YOU BE PRESIDENT -- HOW\nCAN YOU BE PRESIDENT FOR SO MANY PEOPLE?\nSHE TALKS ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE THEY'RE OBJECTS, NOT HUMAN\nBEINGS. >> Reporter: AND AS THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN TRIES TO GO ON THE OFFENSIVE, HIS RUNNING MATE MIKE\nPENCE IS CAUSING THEM TO PLAY SOME DEFTS.\nPENCE GETTING A LITTLE HEAT FOR HIS INTERVIEW ON CNN WHERE HE\nWAS ASKED ABOUT SOME OF THEIR SUPPORT THE CAMPAIGN HAS\nATTRACTED FROM WHITE NATIONALISTS, INCLUDING FROM\nDAVID DUKE, A FORMER KKK LEADER. NOW, PENCE DID DISAVOW DAVID\nDUKE SUPPORT, BUT HE REFUSED TO CALL HIM DEPLORABLE.\nHERE'S WHAT HE TOLD WOLF BLITZER.\n>> I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHY THE MEDIA KEEPS DROPPING DAVID\nDUKE'S NAME. DONALD TRUMP HAS DENOUNCED DAVID\nDUKE REPEATEDLY. WE DON'T WANT HIS SUPPORT.\nAND WE DON'T WANT THE SUPPORT OF PEOPLE WHO THINK LIKE HIM.\n>> SO YOU YOU WOULD CALL HIM A DEPLORABLE?\n>> NO, I'M NOT IN THE NAME CALLING BUSINESS, WOLF.\nYOU KNOW ME BETTER THAN THAT. >> Reporter: AND THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN HAS POUNCED RIGHT ON THAT, TWEETING OUT, QUOTE, IF\nYOU WON'T SAY THE KKK IS DEPLORABLE, YOU HAVE NO BUSINESS\nRUNNING THE COUNTRY. AND A TRUMP CAMPAIGN OFFICIAL\nTELLS ME THAT DONALD TRUMP WILL KEEP UP THESE ATTACKS ON HILLARY\nCLINTON OVER THIS DEPLORABLE COMMENT.\nTODAY AT HIS EVENT IN IOWA AND LATER TODAY WE WILL SEE THE\nRETURN OF HIS DAUGHTER IVANKA TRUMP.\nSHE'LL BE BACK OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL CAMPAIGNING WITH\nHIM IN PENNSYLVANIA. CHRIS, THIS IS ONE OF HER FIRST\nBIG APPEARANCES SINCE HER CONVENTION SPEECH.\n>> ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nLET'S DISCUSS THESE BIG IDEAS THAT ARE GOING ON IN THE\nCAMPAIGN WITH CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR AND TRUMP SUPPORTER\nKAYLEIGH McNENNE AND CHRISTINE QUINN.\nONE FOR EACH OF YOU. FIRST YOU, CHRISTINE.\nLET'S PUT THAT AXELROD TWEET BACK UP.\nOBVIOUSLY NOT AN ENEMY OF THE CLINTONS.\nHE RAN THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN AGAINST HER IN 2008.\nANTIBIOTICS CAN TAKE CARE OF PNEUMONIA.\nTRUE, DEPENDING WHAT KIND. WHAT'S THE CURE FOR AN UNHEALTHY\nPENSION FOR PRIVACY THAT REPEATEDLY CREATED UNNECESSARY\nPROBLEMS? MY SUGGESTION IS THIS IS NOT\nABOUT HER HEALTH. WE HAVE NO PROOF TO QUESTION HER\nHEALTH IN ANY LEGITIMATE WAY. HOWEVER, WE HAVE A LOT OF PROOF\nTO QUESTION THE NATURE OF TRANSPARENCY WITH THIS CANDIDATE\nAND HER CAMPAIGN. YOU ONLY GET TO KNOW WHAT THEY\nWANT YOU TO KNOW WHEN THEY WANT YOU TO KNOW IT.\nFAIR CRITICISM? >> WELL, I THINK YOU COULD SAY\nTHE FINAL PART OF WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT MOST CANDIDATES OUT THERE,\nRIGHT, THAT THEY TELL US THE INFORMATION.\nI THINK IF ANYBODY HEARD SECRETARY CLINTON LAST NIGHT ON\nANDERSON COOPER, SHE MADE SOME VERY GOOD POINTS.\nSHE DIDN'T THINK THIS WAS A BIG DEAL.\nSHE THOUGHT SHE COULD POWER THROUGH IT.\n>> SAID THE SAME THING ABOUT THE SERVER.\nJUST SAYING, JUST FOR AN ANALOGY.\nYOU KNOW, I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE, I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS THAT\nBIG A DEAL, THE CONTROL OF INFORMATION, THE CONCERN OF\nWHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO HER IF IT GETS OUT FUELS ALMOST A\nPARANOIA. THAT'S THE CRITICISM.\n>> BUT LET ME JUST SAY ONE THING.\nI RESPECT HILLARY CLINTON IN SAYING, I'M GOING TO GO TO THE\n9/11 MEMORIAL, EVEN THOUGH MAYBE THE DOCTORS SAID I SHOULD REST.\nI THINK THAT'S SOMETHING TO BE RESPECTED.\n>> ME TOO. I DID THE INTERVIEW WITH HER ON\nFRIDAY. WE TALKED ABOUT HEALTH.\nWE'RE BOTH ALLERGY SUFFERERS. SHE DIDN'T MENTION PNEUMONIA.\n>> SHE MAY NOT HAVE KNOWN. >> SHE'S GOT A GREAT ENGINE.\nI'M NOT DISPUTING THAT. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE\nTRANSPARENCY. >> I BELIEVE AS SECRETARY\nCLINTON SAID LAST NIGHT, WHETHER IT'S ALL OF THE E-MAILS THAT ARE\nNOW OUT, WHETHER IT'S THE MEDICAL INFORMATION SHE'S PUT\nOUT FROM A DOCTOR WHO HAS ACTUAL PRIVILEGES IN NEW YORK CITY,\nWHICH YOU CANNOT SAY ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S DOCTOR, ALL OF\nTHE TAXES, ALL OF THAT THAT'S OUT THERE IS BEYOND IN SOME\nCASES AN ETHIC STANDARD OF WHAT'S EXPECTED OF A\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. AND YOU CANNOT SAY THAT ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP. JUST TO TELL YOU, WE SEE REPORTS\nIN \"THE WASHINGTON POST\" OF PHANTOM DONATIONS FROM THE TRUMP\nFOUNDATION. >> WE'LL COVER THAT.\nWE HAVE THE WRITER FOR \"THE WASHINGTON POST\" ON SHOW TODAY.\n\"NEW DAY\" HAS BEEN ALL OVER THIS STORY.\nWHAT ARE YOU TAKING EXCEPTION TO?\n>> TO THE FACT SHE SELECTIVELY DISCLOSES WHAT IS IN HER\nINTERESTS. BUT THINGS SHE'S REQUIRED BY LAW\nTO DISCLOSE, THE FEDERAL RECORDS ACT REQUIRES SHE PRESERVES HER\nE-MAILS, HER AIDES TOOK HAMMERS TO THE BLACKBERRIES AND BLEACHED\nTHE SOFTWARE FROM HISTORY. SHE CAN SELECTIVELY DISCLOSE\nTHINGS. SHE'S NOT REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE\nHER MEDICAL RECORDS. WHY DESTROY DOCUMENTS YOU'RE\nREQUIRED BY LAW TO PRESERVE? >> USING THE PHRASE REQUIRED BY\nLAW WOULD IMPLY THAT SOME LAW HAD BEEN BROKEN.\n>> THE FEDERAL RECORDS ACT WAS BROKEN.\n>> WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, AS A LAWYER, THE HEAD OF THE FBI, A\nMAN WHO YOU CANNOT QUESTION HIS RECORD, HAS SAID NO LAW WAS\nBROKEN. >> HOLD ON.\nLET ME PAUSE. JUST FOR YOU AT HOME WHO ARE\nFOLLOWING THIS, YOU'RE IN LAW SCHOOL, YOU'RE A LAWYER.\n>> I'M NOT A LAWYER. >> I'M A LAWYER.\nJUST SO YOU KNOW. THE FEDERAL RECORDS ACT WAS\nARGUABLY VIOLATED BY WHAT SHE DID.\nTHAT IS A STATE DEPARTMENT GUIDELINE THAT THEY WOULD\nENFORCE. SHE WAS OUT OF OFFICE WHEN ALL\nTHIS CAME OUT. SO THEY COULD NOT ENFORCE THAT.\nIT BEING ILLEGAL IS A TERM OF ART THAT WOULD APPLY TO THE\nFEDERAL. THAT'S WHAT THE FBI WAS LOOKING\nAT. THEY FOUND NO BASIS TO PROSECUTE\nTHIS CASE. IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A COME PLEK\nISSUE. >> YES, ABSOLUTELY.\nBUT I WANT TO BE CLEAR. THE DIRECTOR HAS SAID, THE FBI\nDIRECTOR, NO LAWS WERE BROKEN. >> HE CALLED HER EXTREMELY\nCARELESS. >> BEYOND THAT, LOOK AT HIS\nRECORD. WHAT IS NECESSARY FOR\nPRESIDENTIAL DISCLOSURE, WHICH IS A GREAT LITTLE TWIST THERE BY\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, IS NOT THE SAME THING AS A LEGAL STANDARD.\nSINCE RICHARD NIXON, EVERY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HAS\nDISCLOSED THEIR TAXES. I'M NOT SAYING DONALD TRUMP IS\nLEGALLY BOUND TO DO THAT. I'M SAYING HE'S ETHICALLY BOUND\nTO DO THAT. >> LET'S PICK UP THAT PART OF\nTHE BALL. LET'S TAKE THIS IN PIECES.\nWITH THESE TWO CAMPAIGNS, THERE'S A LOT TO TALK ABOUT WHEN\nIT COMES TO TRANSPARENCY. LET'S NOT OVERWHELM THE\nAUDIENCE. FAIR CRITICISM, TRUMP HAS NOT\nGIVEN THE KINDS OF DISCLOSURES WE'RE USED TO SEEING.\nTHE DEFENSE IS, HE'S A PRIVATE CITIZEN.\nI FIND THAT UNSATISFYING. THE FOUNDATION GOING ON RIGHT\nNOW, THE CRITICISM, HE COULD DUMP A TON OF INFORMATION TO\nPROVE WHAT MIKE PENCE IS SAYING. ALL HE HAS TO DO IS RELEASE HIS\nTAXES. CHARITABLE GIVING WOULD BE IN\nTHERE. HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO IT.\nIS HE TO BLAME FOR QUESTIONS OF HIS OWN TRANSPARENCY?\n>> NO, I DON'T THINK SO. HE'S NOT REQUIRED TO RELEASE HIS\nTAXES. IF HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO SO, HE\nDOESN'T HAVE TO. WE KNOW HE'S PAID TAXES WITHIN\nTHE BOUNDS OF LAW. >> HOW DO WE KNOW?\n>> HE SURVIVED NEARLY A DOZEN AUDITS.\n>> WHY ARE THEY AUDITING HIM IF IT'S SUCH A CLEAR QUESTION?\n>> MANY BILLIONAIRES AND MILLIONAIRES ARE AUDITED.\n>> MANY OF THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO CHEAT THE SYSTEM.\n>> DONALD TRUMP HAS SURVIVED NEARLY A DOZEN AUDITS.\nHE'S PAYING TAXES WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF THE LAW.\n>> BY THE WAY, HAVE YOU SEEN PROOF HE'S BEING AUDITED RIGHT\nNOW? >> NO, WE DON'T KNOW THAT, BUT\nWE TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD. >> DO YOU THINK THAT'S ODD?\nSHOW US THE IRS LETTER. >> I CAN PROMISE YOU THIS.\nTHE POLITICIZED IRS WHO WENT AFTER TEA PARTY GROUPS USING THE\nFEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD SOMEHOW FIND A WHAAY TO LET US KNOW.\n>> SHE SAID DONALD TRUMP DISCLOSES WHAT HE WANTS TO.\nHE'S NOT LEGALLY BOUND TO DISCLOSE HIS TAXES.\nSO THE QUESTION POPS INTO MY MIND.\nWHAT IS HE HIDING IF HE DOESN'T DISCLOSE THEM?\nAND WHY DOES HE ONLY TELL US WHAT HE WANTS US TO KNOW AND\nCLAIMS HE'S TRANSPARENT? >> THAT'S THE SAME QUESTION\nPEOPLE HAVE ABOUT YOUR CANDIDATE.\n>> SHE'S DISCLOSED 40 YEARS OF HER TAXES.\n>> BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING SHE WANTED US TO KNOW.\n>> YOU CANNOT SAY DONALD TRUMP IS GIVING EVERYTHING IF YOU THEN\nSAY HE ONLY GIVES WHAT HE WANTS, WHICH IS WHAT IS IN HIS BEST\nINTEREST. LET'S GO TO HIS FOUNDATION.\nTHIS IS AN ENTITY WE DON'T -- WE BELIEVE HE'S GIVEN NO MONEY TO,\nBUT WE DON'T KNOW THAT BECAUSE HE WON'T TELL US, SINCE 2008.\nTHE FOUNDATION GAVE AN ILLEGAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE FLORIDA\nATTORNEY GENERAL WHO THEN STEPPED DOWN ON HER\nINVESTIGATIONS INTO TRUMP UNIVERSITY.\nTHERE ARE NOW REPORTS IN \"THE WASHINGTON POST\" THAT HE USED\nFOUNDATION FUNDS TO BUY ITEMS FOR HIMSELF, WHICH IS ILLEGAL,\nAT BEST. >> WE'RE GOING TO PICK THIS UP\nLATER IN THE SHOW. A QUICK REBUTTAL FROM YOU.\n>> \"WASHINGTON POST,\" THIS IS PROOF OF HORRENDOUS JOURNALISM.\nYOU HAVE THE REPORTER COMING ON. THAT MONEY WENT TO BREAST\nCANCER, WHICH I THINK IS A GREAT CAUSE AN A WORTHY CAUSE FOR A\nFOUNDATION TO DONATE TO. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FIVE\nDISCLOSURES WITHIN HIS FOUNDATION, MANY OF WHICH CAN BE\nPROVEN OFF AS MERELY CLERICAL ERRORS, VERSUS THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION, WHERE SHE MET HALF OF THE DONORS IN NONGOVERNMENT\nMEETINGS. IT WAS A REVOLVING DOOR OF\nCORRUPTION. IF YOU DONATED TO THE\nFOUNDATION, YOU GOT ACCESS TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT.\n>> CORRUPTION IMPLIES THAT WE HAVE PROVEN OR SHOWN PAY FOR\nPLAY. THIS IS ANOTHER SITUATION THAT\nWAS INVESTIGATED BY THE FBI, WHICH IS PART OF THE CLINTON\nDEFENSE. MY GET INVESTIGATED ALL THE TIME\nABOUT STUFF. TRUMP NEVER HAS.\nWHAT IF IT WERE ON HIM? THEY FOUND NO PROOF OF WHAT YOU\nCALL CORRUPTION. CORRUPTION MEANS SOMETHING.\nIT DOESN'T MEAN SMELLS BAD. MEANS IT IS BAD.\n>> SINCE CHRISTINE BRINGS UP THE FBI AND LOVES THE DIRECTOR SO\nMUCH, THE FBI DIRECTOR HAS RECOMMENDED ONE FOUNDATION BE\nINVESTIGATED. THAT'S THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nTHE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DECLINED TO INVESTIGATION.\nTHE FBI RECOMMENDED INVESTIGATION OF THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION. >> WE DON'T KNOW WHO IN THE N\nBI. LET'S GO BACK TO THE SUSAN G.\nKOMEN THING. I DON'T WANT TO THROW AROUND\nBREAST CANCER SURVIVORS AS SOME CLOAK FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nHE WAS TOTALLY ALLOWED TO GIVE FOUNDATION MONEY TO A GOOD\nGROUP, BUT HE DOESN'T GET TO TAKE THE ITEM.\n>> WE DON'T KNOW IF HE HAS THE ITEM.\nHAVE YOU SEEN THE ITEM? >> HE PURCHASED THE ITEM.\nTHIS IS A PATTERN OF ILLEGAL OF WHAT APPEARS TO BE ILLEGAL\nACTION IN THE TRUMP FOUNDATION. YOU CAN'T COVER IT UP.\nTHERE'S NONE OF HIS MONEY THERE SINCE 2008.\nSO HE'S PERFECTLY HAPPY TO GIVE OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY AWAY TO\nCANDIDATES, THE FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL, WHICH IS CLEARLY\nSOMETHING NOT ALLOWED, AND HE WAS FINED FOR THAT\nSIGNIFICANTLY. >> ALL RIGHT.\nON THE FOUNDATION AGAIN, \"NEW DAY\" IS TAKING THIS UP WITH THE\nWRITER FROM \"THE WASHINGTON POST.\"\nWE'LL VET THAT STORY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR MAKING\nTHE CASES FROM THE RESPECTIVE CAMPAIGNS.\nALISYN? >> WELL, HILLARY CLINTON AND\nDONALD TRUMP ARE IN THE FINAL STRETCH OF THE 2016 RACE.\nSO WHAT DO EACH OF THE CAMPAIGNS NEED TO DO TO WIN?\nMICHAEL SMERCONISH HAS SOME FREE ADVICE NEXT.

WELCOME TO \"LEGAL VIEW.\"\nIF YOU THINK YOU'VE SEEN IT ALL IN THE 2016 RACE FOR PRESIDENT,\nA RACE WITH JUST 56 DAYS REMAINING, WE GOT NEWS FOR YOU.\nLITERALLY ON CNN. YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IT ALL.\nTHE NEXT HOUR YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A FIRST.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA CAMPAIGNING SOLO FOR THE WOMAN HE DEARLY HOPES\nWILL SUCCEED HIM IN THE BATTLEGROUND STATE OF\nPENNSYLVANIA. DONALD TRUMP WILL SPEAK FOR\nHIMSELF. NEXT HOUR, IN THE BATTLEGROUND\nSTATE OF IOWA. TONIGHT JOINED BY HIS DAUGHTER\nIVANKA, WHILE HILLARY CLINTON IS GOING TO SPEND YET ANOTHER DAY\nNURSING THE PNEUMONIA THAT TRUMP CAMP MANAGED TO USE AGAINST HER,\nWHILE PUBLICLY SENDING THEIR VERY BEST WISHES FOR A SPEEDY\nRECOVERY. MY CNN COLLEAGUE JASON CARROLL\nSON THE OUTSKIRTS OF DES MOINES WHERE DONALD TRUMP IS DUE TO\nSPEAK ABOUT 1:00 EASTERN TIME AND JEFF ZELENY IS HERE WITH ME\nLIVE IN NEW YORK. JEFF, SPEAKING WITH YOU FIRST,\nBECAUSE WE ARE NOW DAY TWO OF A THE TRAIL AND 56 DAYS TO GO, YOU\nDON'T WANT TO BE OFF THE TRAIL, YOU DON'T.\nDEFINITELY SHE HAS A SCHEDULE AND IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER SHE\nWAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN LOS ANGELES TODAY RAISING MONEY AND\nBILL CLINTON IS FILLING IN FOR HER DOING THAT.\nSHE IS I'M TOLD, SPEND TIME PREPARING FOR THE DEBATE IN 13\nDAYS. I DON'T THINK IT'S AS MUCH OF A\nCRISIS TO HAVE HER OFF THE TRAIL AT THIS MOMENT AS THEY TRY AND\nDEAL WITH THIS TRANSPARENCY. THE BIGGER QUESTION, WORRIES\nINSIDE HER CAMPAIGN THAT THIS IS SORT OF CREATED SOMETHING THAT\nTHEY THOUGHT THEY'D COOLED DOWN. THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT HER\nTRANSPARENCY AND HER HONESTY AND THING, BUT THEY ARE TRYING TO\nFIGURE OUT HOW TO GET HER BACK ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\n>> WHEN? >> HEALTH IS ACTUALLY A SERIOUS\nCONCERN. I WAS HEARING POTENTIALLY COULD\nBE ON THE ROAD AS EARLY AS TOMORROW, POSSIBLY IN\nPHILADELPHIA. NOW, IT MAY BE LATER IN THE\nWEEK. SHE'S DEFINITELY AT LEAST\nSCHEDULED TO BE IN WASHINGTON FOR A CONGRESSIONAL HISPANIC\nCAUCUS DINNER THURSDAY AND SPEAKING AGAIN IN WASHINGTON\nFRIDAY, BUT SHE ACTUALLY IS FOLLOWING DOCTORS' ORDERS, OR AT\nLEAST UNDER THEM AND HAS NOT GONON A GREEN LIGHT TO GO AHEAD\nAND START CAMPAIGNING AGAIN. >> JASON CARROLL, YESTERDAY\nMIGHT HAVE BEEN WHAT SOME WOULD CALL A BIT OF A GIFT FOR THE\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON TOOK IT ON THE CHIN FOR\nTRANSPARENCY, ALL THE WHILE, PESKY QUESTIONS ABOUT TAX\nRETURNS HAVE NOT BEEN ANSWERED, OR HAVE BEEN ANSWERED IN A WAY\nTHAT SEEM UNSATISFYING TO SOME. I WANT TO PLAY FOR YOU, JASON,\nIF I CAN, MIKE PENCE, TRUMP'S RUNNING MATE, GRILLED BY WOLF\nBLITZER ABOUT THE TAX RETURNS, AND ABOUT THE RELEASE OF THE TAX\nRETURNS. HERE'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY TO\nWOLF. >> I THINK THE COMMITMENT DONALD\nTRUMP HAS MADE IS ONCE THE ROUTINE AUDIT IS DONE HE'LL\nRELEASE THE TAX RETURNS IN TOTALITY AND NOT PARCH THEM OUT\nPIECE BY PIECE AS YOU MIGHT SUGGEST.\n>> THE QUESTION, WHY ISN'T HE LIVING UP TO THE MIKE PENCE\nSTANDARD? >> WELL, DONALD TRUMP MADE IT\nVERY CLEAR. HE HAS LIVED IN THE PUBLIC EYE A\nLONG TIME, IS FULLY TRANSPARENT ABOUT HIS FINANCIAL DEALINGS AS\nTHE LAW REQUIRES, IN HIS FEDERAL FILINGS, AND THOSE TAX RETURNS\nWILL BE OUT WHEN THAT ROUTINE AUDIT IS DONE.\n>> FULLY TRANSPARENT IN HIS FINANCIAL DEALINGS AS THE LAW\nREQUIRES, JASON, BUT NOT AS TRADITIONAL CAMPAIGNING\nREQUIRES. ARE THEY AVOIDING THIS QUESTION\nOUT THERE WHERE YOU ARE, OR ARE YOU ABLE TO GET CLOSE ENOUGH TO\nTHAT COMPLAIN TO PRESS CONSTANTLY ON TAX RETURNS?\n>> Reporter: LOOK, BE CLEAR. TRUMP, FOR HIS PART HARKS SAID\nREPEATEDLY CLINTON IS THE ONE NOT TRANSPARENT, NOT TRANSPARENT\nABOUT HER HEALTH. NOT TRANSPARENT ABOUT HER\nE-MAILS. BUT, LOOK, AS YOU KNOW, HE HAS\nTAKEN HEAT HIMSELF FOR NOT RELEASING HIS TAX RETURNS AND\nSAID REPEATEDLY HE'S NOT GOING TO DO IT BECAUSE HE'S UNDER IRS\nAUDIT, THOUGH THE IRS MADE IT CLEAR BECAUSE YOU'RE UNDER AUDIT\nTHAT DOES NOT PREVENT YOU FROM RELEASING RETURNS.\nWHEN YOU SPEAK TO FOLKS HERE, I HAVE TO SOME, SOME FEEL THIS IS\nIMPORTANT. IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF\nTRANSPARENCY FOR TRUMP TO DO THIS.\nPENCE HAS SAID REPEATEDLY THAT THIS IS NOT REALLY AN ISSUE WITH\nVOTERS AT LARGE, AND I HAVE TO SAY, IN SPEAKING TO A NUMBER OF\nFOLKS OUT HERE, EVEN THOUGH SOME SAY HE SHOULD RELEASE HIS TAX\nRETURNS, THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF FOLKS, TRUMP\nSUPPORTERS, WHO SAY THEY DON'T REALLY FEEL AS THOUGH IT'S\nIMPORTANT. MORE FOCUSED ON THINGS LIKE THE\nECONOMY, NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES, DEALING WITH THINGS LIKE\nTHAT, OR EVEN HEALTH CARE. SO I DON'T THINK THIS IS\nSOMETHING THAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN ULTIMATELY, ASHLEIGH,\nIS GOING TO BUDGE ON. IT'S NOT AN ISSUE THEY ARE GOING\nTO ADDRESS, EVEN THOUGH THE PRESS BRINGS IT UP.\nI WOULD NOT LOOK FOR DONALD TRUMP TO RELEASE TAX RETURNS\nANYTIME SOON. >> THE FOLKS IN THE ROOM MAY NOT\nCARE ABOUT THEM, BUT THE FOLKS IN THE BIG AMERICAN ROOM DO CARE\nABOUT THEM TO THE TUNE OF 74% OF VOTERS POLLED WANT TO SEE THEM.\nBREAK IT DOWN TO REPUBLICANS, MAYBE DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTER,\n62% OF REPUBLICANS WANT TO SEE THE TAX RETURNS.\nHOLD ON, JASON, BECAUSE THIS AND THAT AND THE TIT FOR TAT IS\nGOING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THESE CAMPAIGNS AND WHILE\nHILLARY CLINTON IS IN BED TRYING TO GET BETTER, PRESIDENT OBAMA\nAND HER DAUGHTER CHELSEA AND HUSBAND BILL ARE THE ONES WHO\nARE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE TO THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND TALK TO THE\nREAL PEOPLE OUT THERE AND DO SOME OF THAT WORK FOR HER, AND\nIN THAT EFFORT, THE HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS ALSO\nRELEASED AN AD, AND IT'S ANSWERING TO DONALD TRUMP SAYING\nTO HER THAT WHEN YOU CALL PEOPLE A BASKET OF DEPLORABLES, WELL\nHILLARY CLINTON'S AD IS SUGGESTING HERE'S WHAT YOU'VE\nCALLED PEOPLE. HAVE A LOOK. \u00e2\u0099\u00aa\n>> HOW STUPID ARE THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY?\n>> WE'RE BUILDING A WALL. HE'S A MEXICAN.\n>> YOU GOT TO SEE THIS GUY, AH -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SAID.\nAH -- I DON'T REMEMBER! >> YOU'RE LIVING IN POVERTY.\nYOUR SCHOOLS ARE NO GOOD. YOU HAVE NO JOBS.\n>> WHAT THE -- >> JEFF ZELENY, AS SHE GETS\nPREPARED TO HEAD BACK ON THE TRAIL, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, OR\nWHICH SHE'S WELL ENOUGH TO DO SO, HOW DO HER SURROGATES, THOSE\nCHIEF SURROGATES, PRESIDENT OBAMA, HER DAUGHTER, HER\nHUSBAND, HOW DO THEY TAKE THIS MESSAGE?\nBECAUSE THIS IS UGLY STUFF. >> NO DOUBT.\nAND THEY'RE DOING IT TODAY. SHE IS UP ON THE AIR IN\nBATTLEGROUND STATES, SOMETHING TRUMP IS NOT.\nYES, PROBABLY PREFER TO BE OUT CAMPAIGNING.\nIF THERE OR NOT, THAT AD IS RUNNING AND THEY'RE TRYING TO\nMAKE DNT'S OLD WORDS THE SOUND TRACK OF THIS CAMPAIGN.\nCHELSEA CLINTON HAS TWO EVENTS. PRESIDENT OBAMA MORE\nSIGNIFICANTLY THAN ANYONE DOING A SOLO EVENT IN PHILADELPHIA.\nGUESS WHY PHILADELPHIA? IT'S FOUR WEEKS FROM TODAY WHERE\nVOTER REGISTRATION ENDS. TRYING TO FIRE UP THAT OBAMA\nCOALITION, NOT AS EXCITED FOR HILLARY CLINTON AS IT WAS FOR\nHIM. WHY MICHELLE OBAMA IS GOING OUT\nON THE ROAD AS WELL ON FRIDAY. IT REALLY TAKE AS VILLAGE, TO\nUSE HER EXPRESSION, AND SHE'S TRYING TO USE THAT DEMOCRATIC\nVILLAGE TO SORT OF BUILD HER UP HERE, BUT THAT AD -- IS A\nCENTRAL SIGN YET AGAIN THAT DONALD TRUMP CAN SAY WHATEVER HE\nWANTS NOW. THE WORDS HE SAID UP TO THIS\nPOINT ARE REVERBERATING, AT LEAST THEY HOPE THEY WILL BE.\n>> JEFF ZELENY, KEEP AN EYE ON THINGS.\nIF YOU GET A BREAK ON THE DATA WE'LL BREAK IN AND COVER THAT.\nJASON CARROLL AS WELL DOING A JOB FOR US ON THE TRUMP CAMP.\nAPPRECIATE THAT. I WANT TO TALK MORE ABOUT THE\nWHOLE TRANSPARENCY THING, BECAUSE IT SPEAKS TO BOTH OF\nTHESE CAMPAIGNS AND I GOT THE THINK TANK FOR THIS.\nCNN POLITICS REPORTER STEPHEN WITH ME AND PROFESSOR IN\nPOLITICS EDITOR AT THE ROOT.COM JASON JOHNSON IS HERE AND FROM\nCHARLOTTESVILLE, VIRGINIA, DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR\nPOLITICS AT UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, LARRY SALVEBATOW WHO W\nAS THING OR TWO ABOUT POLLING FOR THE PRESIDENCY.\nMY COLLEAGUE ANDERSON KEEPER HAD A NICE EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH\nHILLARY CLINTON AS SHE WAS RECUPERATING BUT DIDN'T GO EASY\nON HER ON THE DELAY OF REVEALING THIS PNEUMONIA ISSUE.\nSPEAK WHAT'S YOU HAVE BEEN WRITING ABOUT, THE TRANSPARENCY\nPROBLEM. HAVE A LISTEN TO ANDERSON'S\nQUESTION. >> DOESN'T YOUR HANDLING -- OF\nTHIS, IN YOUR CAMPAIGNS, YOU KNOW, REFUSAL TO ACKNOWLEDGE\nWHAT HAPPENED UNTIL REALLY AFTER THAT VIDEO WAS CIRCULATED\nCONFIRM SUSPICION TO VOTERS YOU'RE NOT TRANSPARENT OR\nTRUSTWORTHY? >> OH, MY GOODNESS, ANDERSON.\nYOU KNOW, COMPARE EVERYTHING YOU KNOW ABOUT ME WITH MY OPPONENT.\nI THINK IT'S TIME HE MET THE SAME LEVEL OF DISCLOSURE THAT I\nHAVE FOR YEARS. YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT A MEDICAL\nREPORT ON ME THAT MEETS THE SAME STANDARD AS MITT ROMNEY AND\nBARACK OBAMA. DONALD TRUMP'S DOCTOR SAID HE'D\nBE THE HEALTHIEST PRESIDENT IN HISTORY.\nTHAT'S NOT EVEN SERIOUS. AND I'VE RELEASED NEARLY 40\nYEARS OF TAX RETURNS. HE HASN'T RELEASED ONE.\nTHIS IS A MAN WITH UNKNOWN NUMBERS, OF PARTNERS AND\nINVESTORS, WHO SAYS HE'S DOING 120 FOREIGN DEALS.\nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE TO KNOW WHAT HE'S UP TO AND WHAT HE\nIS HIDING. >> SO STEPHEN, THIS IS HARD\nSTUFF TO MEASURE, BUT IF ONE WOULD HAVE TO MEASURE IT, DOES\nDID ONLY GO THROUGH THE PRISM OF WHO YOUR GUY IS, OR CAN THIS BE\nMEASURED, CAMPAIGNED OUT GET TO WHO'S BEING LESS TRANSPARENT?\n>> ULTIMATELY UP TO THE CAMPAIGNS TO DISCLOSE.\nHILLARY CLINTON IS CORRECT. SHE HAS ISSUED MORE FINANCIAL\nINFORMATION THAN DONALD TRUMP, HAS ISSUED MORE MEDICAL\nINFORMATION THAN DONALD TRUMP. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS THAT,\nYOU KNOW, SHE'S NOT PERHAPS THE BEST MESSENGER FOR THAT MESSAGE.\nWE KNOW FROM THE POLLS AND HER OWN POLITICAL HISTORY VOTERS DO\nHAVE PROBLEMS WITH HER HONESTY. THEY BELIEVE SHE IS NOT SOMEONE\nTHAT ALWAYS COMES FORWARD AND DISCLOSES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.\nTHAT'S WHY IT'S A DIFFICULT POLITICAL ISSUE TO GAME OUT.\nYOU KNOW, IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THIS UNFORTUNATE HEALTH INCIDENT\nWITH HILLARY CLINTON, WE COULD BE HEADING INTO THIS ELECTION\nWITH A MEDICAL STATEMENT FROM HILLARY CLINTON, WHICH IS MORE\nTHAN A YEAR OLD, HER TAX RETURNS GRANTED, BUT A LAUGHABLY SORT OF\nCONCISE STATEMENT ON DONALD TRUMP'S MEDICAL HISTORY FROM HIS\nDOCTORS AND NO TAX RETURNS. THAT WOULD BE UNPRECEDENTED.\n>> SO, LARRY, I WANT TO BRING YOU IN ON THIS WITH NUMBERS, IF\nI CAN. I'M SURE YOU LISTENED IN TO THE\nINTERVIEW WITH OUR CORRESPONDENTS PRIOR TO THIS,\nAND YOU KNOW, JASON CARROLL NAILED IT.\nHE SAID, NO ONE IN THIS HALL REALLY SEEMS TO CARE ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP'S FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY.\nTHOSE TAX RETURNS, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE ACTUAL POLLING, I\nSAID IT BEFORE. I'M GOING TO SAY IT AGAIN.\n74% OF ALL VOTERS ASKED SAY THEY DO WANT TO SEE THOSE TAX RETURNS\nAND AMONG THOSE, 62% OF REPUBLICANS ASKED, SAID THEY\nWANT TO SEE THOSE TAX RETURNS. CAN DONALD TRUMP IGNORE THOSE\nWIDER NUMBERS? I DON'T THINK THAT MAN LIVES IN\nTHE BUBBLE OF HIS ARENA THAT LOVE HIM?\nCAN HE IGNORE OR BULLY OR CAMPAIGN HIS WAY OUT OF THOSE\nNUMBERS? >> WELL, HE MIGHT DO JUST THAT.\nTHE TRAGEDY IS THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS BROKEN A 40-YEAR PACT THAT\nCANDIDATES HAVE HAD WITH THE AMERICAN ELECTORATE TO RELEASE\nAT LEAST SOME OF THEIR TAX RETURNS, AND THOSE RETURNS ARE\nCRITICAL TO UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT A CANDIDATE HAS DONE, WHAT\nA CANDIDATE'S VALUES ARE. WHO A CANDIDATE, PERHAPS, IS\nINDEBTED TO. THERE ARE LOTS OF PIECES THAT\nCOME INTO FOCUS WHEN YOU HAVE THOSE TAX RETURNS.\nWHAT DEPRESSES ME, THAT 74% NUMBER, OR WHATEVER IT WAS,\nOUGHT TO BE 100%, BECAUSE SOONER OR LATER, THE REPUBLICANS ARE\nGOING TO FIND THEY'LL BE A DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE WHO WILL CITE\nTHE DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENT, PRECEDENT, AND WON'T RELEASE HIS\nOR HER TAX RETURNS. >> ALL RIGHT.\nSTAND BY, IF YOU WILL. WHEN WE COME BACK, JASON, I'M\nGOING TO ASK YOU SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE HEALTH REQUIREMENTS,\nAND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SAID.\nWE PUT IT TO THE CAMPAIGN TODAY ABOUT THAT DOCTOR'S LETTER THAT\nCAME FROM THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, SAYING THINGS LIKE, DONALD'S\nHEALTH IS ASTONISHINGLY EXCELLENT AND HE'D BE THE\nHEALTHIEST PERSON EVER ELECTED PRESIDENT.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE HAD A GOOD CHUCKLE OVER THAT.\nYOU SHOULD HEAR WHAT THE CAMPAIGN HAS TO SAY ABOUT ALL OF\nTHOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE LAUGHING.",

HE WAS VERY WELL VERSED IN THE\nCOMMANDER-IN-CHIEF FORUM WE SAW ON NBC LAST WEEK WHEN HE WAS\nTALKING ABOUT TRUMP NOT BEING PRESSED ON HIS STATED PRE-IRAQ\nWAR OPPOSITION WHICH IS COUNTERFACTUAL FROM WHAT HE TOLD\nHOWARD STERN SO WHAT JUMPED OUT TO ME WAS THE PRESIDENT IS\nKEENLY AWARE OF THE CAMPAIGN DEVELOPMENTS AND IS WATCHING THE\nCAMPAIGN COVERAGE PRETTY CLOSELY OVER THE LAST WEEK, THIS GUY IS\nDIALLED INTO THIS RACE BECAUSE CLEARLY IT IS HIS LEGACY THAT IS\nON THE LINE HERE THAT IS ONE REASON HE FEELS SO INVESTED IN\nHILLARY CLINTON AND THE OTHER AS WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST COUPLE\nMONTHS, HE IS SOMEWHAT ALARMED AT TRUMP'S CANDIDACY AND THOSE\nWERE CLEARLY PRESENT ON THE STUMP TODAY.\n>> HE MENTIONED THE \"T\" WORD BEING TRANSPARENCY.\nKAYLY, I WANT TO COME TO YOU, IF YOU FLICKED ON CNN.COM THE\nHEADLINE WAS LIKE THE LEAST TRANSPARENT ELECTION OF ALL\nTIME. YOU HAD HILLARY CLINTON WITH\nANDERSON SAYING \"I'VE GIVEN MY MEDICAL RECORDS, I'M GIVING MORE\nTHIS WEEK, I'VE GIVEN MY TAX RETURNS FOR A DECADE PLUS.\"\nWHY DON'T WE KNOW MORE ABOUT DONALD TRUMP?\n>> I THINK WE KNOW A LOT ABOUT DONALD TRUMP.\nHE'S BEEN THE MOST ACCESSIBLE CANDIDATE IN POLITICAL HISTORY\nGIVING INTERVIEWS TO FRIENDLY NEWS STATIONS, UNFRIENDLY NEWS\nSTATIONS. HE'S BEEN VERY TRANSPARENT.\n>> AN INTERVIEW IS AN INTERVIEW AND WE'RE GRATEFUL BUT IT'S NOT\nMEDICAL RECORDS OR TAX RETURNS OR PROOF OF AN AUDIT TO GET TAX\nRETURNS. >> YOU'RE NOT REQUIRED BY LAW TO\nRELEASE YOUR TAX RETURNS LIKE WISE YOU'RE NOT REQUIRED TO\nRELEASE YOUR MEDICAL RECORDS, WHAT YOU ARE REQUIRED TO RELEASE\nAND PRESERVE ARE DOCUMENTS WITHIN THE REALM OF THE FEDERAL\nGOVERNMENT, THE FEDERAL RECORDS ACT REQUIRES THAT AND IT'S HARD\nFOR THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION OR FUTURE HOPING TO BE CLINTON\nADMINISTRATION TO MAKE A TRANSPARENCY ARGUMENT WHEN THEY\nTOOK HAMMERS TO BLACKBERRIES, WHEN THEY USED A SOFTWARE\nPROCESS TO BLEACH E-MAILS THAT THEY WERE TO PRESERVE.\n>> VALID CONCERN AND AN ISSUE ON HER TRUSTWORTHINESS BUT I'M\nLOOKING AT YOUR CASE. >> WHEN YOU CAN'T DEFEND YOUR\nATTACK -- AND THIS'S WHAT KAYLEIGH IS DOING.\nHILLARY CLINTON AND BILL CLINTON RELEASED THEIR TAX RETURNS FOR\n2015 WHICH MEANS THEY'VE RELEASED THEIR TAX RETURNS FOR\nTHE LAST 39 YEARS. AND FROM DONALD TRUMP BIG FAT\nZERO. I HAVE A BIG QUESTION -- WHY IS\nDONALD TRUMP SPENDING SO MUCH TIME PRAISING VLADIMIR PUTIN?\nDOES HE HAVE SOME HOTEL DEAL IN MOSCOW?\nWE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE HE WON'T RELEASE HIS TAX RETURN.\nYOU WANT TRANSPARENCY, SEE THE TAX RETURN.\nWHICH MIKE PENCE DID FOR HIS RETURNS.\n>> EXACTLY RIGHT AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT FROM DONALD TRUMP.\n>> THIS IS WHY I AM WHERE I AM SUPPORTING NEITHER CANDIDATE.\nIT'S A RACE TO THE BOTTOM. >> YOU'RE NOT ALONE.\n>> WHEN IT COMES TO TRANSPARENCY AND WHEN IT COMES TO HONESTY AND\nTRUSTWORTHINESS. IT'S APPLES AND ORANGES ON THIS\nISSUE. MAYBE HE WINS ON THIS ONE, MAYBE\nSHE WINS BUT THESE ARE TWO WOULD HAVE THE LEAST-LIKED CANDIDATES\nWE'VE EVER HAD RUN FOR PRESIDENT.\nTHEY'S A REASON WHY. THEY MIGHT NOT BE COMPARABLE, I\nHAPPEN TO THINK THEY'RE NOT BUT THERE'S A REASON WHY ONLY 10% OF\nTHE AMERICAN ELECTORATE NOMINATED THESE TWO PEOPLE TO BE\nTHEIR NOMINEES AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE SITTING AT HOME ARE\nWATCHING SOMEONE LIKE PRESIDENT OBAMA DO A GREAT JOB.\nHE'S VERY CHARMING, VERY GOOD AT CAMPAIGNING BUT MAKING FUN OF\nDONALD TRUMP AND THINKING THIS IS SERIOUS.\nBOTH OF THESE CANDIDATES ARE TERRIBLE.\nWHO AM I GOING TO VOTE FOR? YOU'RE NOT TAKING THIS CANDIDATE\nSERIOUSLY. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE GIVEN\nHILLARY CLINTON A RIDE, A FREE PASS FOR TOO LONG.\nSO THERE ARE A LOT OF FRUSTRATED PEOPLE LIKE ME WITH NOWHERE TO\nGO. >> GO AHEAD HILARY ROSEN ON THE\nFREE PASS. I HEAR YOU MOANING.\n>> I DON'T THINK ANYONE THINKS HILLARY CLINTON HAS GOTTEN A\nFREE PASS, IF ANYTHING I THINK PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO MAKE\nEQUIVALENT TO ARGUMENTS LIKE WE JUST HEARD KAYLEIGH DO ABOUT\nTHEIR PERSONAL ACTIVITIES OVER THE YEARS BUT HERE'S THE\nINTERESTING THING BECAUSE I HEAR MY FRIEND S.E'S FRUSTRATION IN\nHER VOICE WHICH IS ONE OF MY OTHER FAVORITE LINES OF\nPRESIDENT OBAMA THIS YEAR WAS WHEN HE GAVE A SPEECH RECENTLY\nAND SAID \"NOW SOME PEOPLE MIGHT WANT TO PICK SOMETHING OFF THE\nMENU BUT WE GOT FISH OR WE GOT STEAK, YOU HAVE TO PICK ONE, YOU\nHAVE TO ENGAGE.\" THAT'S WHY HIS ARGUMENT TODAY\nABOUT THIS IS -- DEMOCRACY IS NOT A SPECTATOR SPORT, YOU HAVE\nTO GET INTO THE ARENA, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE STAKES THAT\nARE IN PLAY HERE AND FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING TO MATTER THE\nMOST. SO IF YOU'RE FOR NOT RAISING THE\nMINIMUM WAGE, IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THE PROGRESS AND DECISIONS\nTHE SUPREME COURT HAVE MADE, IF YOU WORRY ABOUT HEALTH CARE\nYOU'RE GOING TO BE FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS PROMISED TO BRING PEOPLE BACKWARDS ON THE\nECONOMY, ON PROGRESSIVE ISSUES, ON LEGAL AND EQUAL RIGHTS SO\nIT'S FISH OR STEAK, THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE.\nELECTIONS ARE ABOUT CHOICES. >> ON THE ECONOMY WHEN YOU\nLISTEN TO THESE TWO DIFFERENT CANDIDATES AS WE HAVE FROM\nMONTHS AND MONTHS THEY PAINT TWO VERY DIFFERENT PICTURES OF\nAMERICA BUT DAVID CHALIAN IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT THE FACTS WE\nGOT FROM THE U.S. CENSUS BUREAU, THIS IS SOMETHING THE PRESIDENT\nTOUTED AS HE SAID CHANGE WOULD COME AND IT'S POSITIVE NEWS FOR\nHIM AND THE PRO SERB Y'ALL THIRD TERM IF THERE WERE TO BE A\nPRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON THAT THE MEDIAN INCOME IN THE U.S. IS\nUP. YOU HAVE TO NUMBERS ON THE\nSCREEN. HOW WILL THIS PLAY FOR THE\nDEMOCRATS? >> SO YOU SEE THE TREND THAT IT\nHAD BEEN TRENDING UP, RIGHT? WHAT YOU SEE THERE, THAT LINE.\nNOW IT'S AT A LEVEL WHERE, YOU KNOW, IT WAS HIGHER, IT'S THE\nFASTEST WE'VE SEEN IT CLIMB IS WITH THE STATISTIC.\nMY QUESTION IS ARE PEOPLE FEELING THAT?\nWE'VE TALKED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THESE ECONOMIC STATISTICS\nWE'VE SEEN, MONTH-TO-MONTH UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, WHAT HAVE\nYOU, YET WE KNOW THERE IS A TON OF ECONOMIC STRIFE IN THE\nCOUNTRY AND PEOPLE AREN'T NECESSARILY FEELING IT.\nNOW THAT THE MEDIAN INCOME IS ON THE RISE, ARE PEOPLE FEELING\nTHAT IN A WAY? I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THAT\nANSWER BUT THAT IS THE POTENTIAL FOR A ELECTORAL IMPACT.\n>> ON DAVID'S POINT, THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.\nTHERE WAS A MOMENT DURING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S CAMPAIGN RALLY\nWHERE HE SAID $2 NATIONAL GAS, THANKS, OBAMA.\nAND IT'S A CUTE LINE AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE APPRECIATE $2\nGLASS BUT IT'S ALSO GLIB WHEN I DON'T THINK EVERYONE FEELS THE\nEFFECT OF AN IMPROVING ECONOMY AND I THINK OBVIOUSLY IN HILLARY\nCLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP PEOPLE ARE FRUSTRATED.\n>> MORE THAN TWO-THIRDS OF AMERICANS THINK WE'RE ON THE\nWRONG TRACK.

              "text": ">>> KEEPING AN EYE ON TWO BIG\nSTAGES, ONE IN IOWA, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DONALD\nTRUMP IS SET TO SPEAK LITERALLY AT ANY MOMENT.\nTHE OTHER IN PHILADELPHIA, WHERE PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA HITS THE\nCAMPAIGN TRAIL THIS HOUR IN SUPPORT OF HIS PARTY'S\nCANDIDATE, HILLARY CLINTON. ALL OF THIS WITH JUST UNDER 56\nDAYS TO GO UNTIL THE U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.\n13 DAYS OUT FROM THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE.\nTHE TWO CAMPAIGNS ARE IN VERY DIFFERENT FOOTING RIGHT NOW.\nDONALD TRUMP IS ON THE OFFENSIVE TAKING SHOTS AT HILLARY CLINTON\nOVER HER CALLING HALF OF HIS SUPPORTERS, I'M QUOTING NOW,\nDEPLORABLES. THAT HAS BECOME THE NEXUS OF HIS\nLATEST ATTACKS. >> WE HAVE EVERYBODY SUPPORTING\nUS, FOLKS. EVERYBODY.\nWE HAVE PEOPLE -- WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL.\nWE HAVE SOME THAT HAVEN'T QUITE BEEN AS SUCCESSFUL.\nLET ME TELL YOU, WE HAVE EVERYBODY, BECAUSE EVERYBODY\nKNOWS WHAT A MESS OUR COUNTRY IS IN.\nSHE LOOKS DOWN ON THE PEOPLE WHO COOK HER MEALS, DRIVE HER CARS\nAND DIG THE COAL THAT POWER HER ELECTRICITY.\n>> ON THE OTHER SIDE, YOU HAVE THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN RIGHT NOW\nHILLARY CLINTON IS SCHEDULED TO GET BACK INTO THE CAMPAIGN GAME\nBY THURSDAY, AND A CONGRESSIONAL HISPANIC CAUCUS EVENT HERE IN\nWASHINGTON. FOR NOW SHE'S OBEYING HER\nDOCTORS' ORDERS ARE GETTING SOME REST WHILE SHE DEALS WITH A BOUT\nOF PNEUMONIA THAT HAS PUT CLINTON AND HER CAMPAIGN ON THE\nDEFENSE, SPENDING THE MAJORITY OF THEIR TIME EXPLAINING HER\nILLNESS AND THE REASON HER DIAGNOSIS WASN'T REVEALED RIGHT\nAWAY. >> I JUST DIDN'T THINK IT WAS\nGOING TO BE THAT BIG A DEAL. YOU KNOW, I KNOW CHUCK SAID\nTODAY, HE DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY. IT'S JUST THE KIND OF THING IF\nIT HAPPEN TO YOU AND YOUR A BUSY, ACTIVE PERSON, YOU KEEP\nMOVING FORWARD, AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY, ANDERSON\nTHAT PEOPLE KNOW MORE ABOUT ME THAN ALMOST ANYONE IN PUBLIC\nLIFE. IT'S SO STRANGE THAT WITH ALL OF\nTHAT INFORMATION OUT THERE, AND AS SOON AS IT BECAME CLEAR I\nCOULDN'T POWER THROUGH, WE, YOU KNOW, WE SAID WHAT WAS GOING ON.\n>> I THINK EVERYTHING'S A CAMPAIGN ISSUE.\nI THINK HER LIFESTYLE AND HER UNDERLYING INDICATOR FROM BLOOD\nPRESSURE TO AMOUNT OF EXERCISE TO EVERYTHING ELSE MEANS IT'S\nALMOST CERTAIN SHE'S IN BETTER HEALTH THAN HER OPPONENT, BUT WE\nDON'T KNOW, BECAUSE HE HASN'T DISCLOSED.\n>> THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS PUSHING FOR MORE TRANSPARENCY\nFROM DONALD TRUMP, FROM MEDICAL RECORDS TO TAX RECORDS TO\nCHARITABLE FOUNDATION RECORDS, BUT FOR DONALD TRUMP, HE'S GOT\nHIS FOOT ON THE GAS NOW FULL SPEED AHEAD WITH HIS ATTACKS\nAGAINST HILLARY CLINTON. OUR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT JASON\nCARROLL IS IN IOWA RIGHT NOW AT THE TRUMP EVENT.\nOUR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT MICHELLE KACZYNSKI IS WITH THE\nPRESIDENT IN PHILADELPHIA FOR THE CLINTON EVENT LATER THIS\nHOUR. WE'LL HAVE COVERAGE OF BOTH.\nSTAND BY FOR THAT. JASON, SHOULD WE EXPECT DONALD\nTRUMP TO KEEP FOCUSING IN ON THAT NARRATIVE AND CLINTON'S\nDEPLORABLES COMMENT? >> Reporter: WITHOUT QUESTION,\nWOLF. LOOK, EVEN BEFORE I WALKED INTO\nTHIS VENUE I RAN INTO A WOMAN WEARING AN \"I LOVE DEPLORABLES\"\nT-SHIRT. SHE MADE IT HERSELF.\nONE OF THE SPEAKERS JUST UP A SHORT WHILE AGO REACHED OUT AND\nSAID WHAT A GREAT LOOKING GROUP OF DEPLORABLES, AND THE CROWD\nERUPTED WITH APPLAUSE. SOMETHING, WOLF, THAT TOUCH ADD\nNERVE WITH A NUMBER OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS.\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN KNOWS THAT. TRUMP CRITICIZED CLINTON FOR\nTHIS LAST NIGHT. HE'S GOING TO DO IT AGAIN TODAY\nWHEN WHEN HE TAKE AS STAGE A FEW MOMENTS FROM NOW.\nEXPECT MORE CRITICISM. HE SAYS IT'S MORE EVIDENCE THAT\nHILLARY CLINTON IS OUT OF TOUCH WITH WORKING-CLASS VOTERS.\nSO MORE CRITICISM OF CLINTON TODAY.\nTONIGHT, THOUGH, WOLF, WE SHOULD TELL YOU, TRUMP WILL BE TALKING\nPOLICY WHEN HE'S IN PENNSYLVANIA.\nHE'LL BE UNVEILING HIS CHILD CARE AFFORDABILITY PLAN, HIS\nDAUGHTER IVANKA TRUMP PLANNING TO JOIN HIM.\nSHE'S BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN PUTTING TOGETHER THIS PLAN.\nSO TONIGHT IT'S GOING TO BE POLICY, BUT TODAY HERE IN IOWA,\nIT'S GOING TO BE ALL THAT CRITICISM AND HILLARY CLINTON\nAND THAT DEPLORABLES COMMENT. WOLF?\n>> WE'RE TOLD HE'LL HIT THE HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN VERY\nHARD. MICHELLE, YOU'RE THERE IN\nPHILADELPHIA. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES IS SPEAKING LATER THIS HOUR THERE.\nWE'RE TOLD HE'LL BE HITTING DONALD TRUMP PRETTY HARD AS\nWELL. WHAT ARE YOU HEARING ABOUT THE\nTONE, THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT WILL SAY?\n>> Reporter: WE KNOW GENERALLY THE PRESIDENT LIKES TO STAY OUT\nOF THE FRAY. HE DOESN'T LIKE TO, EVEN MENTION\nHIS NAME, WHEN OUT IN A PUBLIC EVENT LIKE THIS.\nHE WILL REFER, THOUGH, TO THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE.\nIN A SETTING LIKE THIS HE LIKES TO GIVE THESE KINDS OF DIGS,\nSOMETIMES USING HUMOR TO GET THE CROWD GOING.\nKIND OF LIKE AN ASIDE. HINT, HINT, WE ALL KNOW WHO I'M\nTALKING ABOUT, RIGHT? IT'S A PRESS CONFERENCE SETTING\nHE IS ASKED QUESTIONS DIRECTLY ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS DONALD\nTRUMP HAS SAID THAT HE GETS MORE CUTTING.\nTHAT HE REALLY GETS CRITICAL. RECENTLY WE HEARD HIM SAY THAT\nDONALD TRUMP IS NOT QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES. AND THE PRESIDENT SAID HE PROVES\nTHAT EVERY TIME HE OPENS HIS MOUTH.\nI DON'T KNOW HE'S GOING TO BE THAT CRITICAL HERE.\nI MEAN, AT AN EVENT LIKE THIS, WHERE HE HAS HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE\nGATHERED, HERE IN PHILADELPHIA, AT THE ART MUSEUM, THE STEPS,\nKNOWN AS THE ROCKY STEPS, E HAD LIKES TO KEEP THE TONE POSITIVE.\nLIKES TO BOOST HILLARY CLINTON. TRY TO REV THE BASE UP, GET\nPEOPLE OUT TO VOTE. THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE WHITE\nHOUSE SEES PRESIDENT OBAMA'S NUMBER ONE GOAL BEING.\nNOT NECESSARILY TO TRY TO WIN VOTERS AWAY FROM DONALD TRUMP.\nI MEAN, LOOK AT THIS. OBVIOUSLY HE'S PREACHING TO THE\nCHOIR, BUT THEY SEE HIM AS MOTIVATING PEOPLE TO GET THE\nVOTE OUT. THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY GOING TO BE\nCRITICAL, OF COURSE IN THIS TIGHT RACE, WOLF.\n>> THIS IS THE FIRST TIME, MICHELLE THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS\nGONE OUT ON HIS OWN, SOLO, TO CAMPAIGN FOR HILLARY CLINTON,\nBUT WHAT DO WE EXPECT IN THE WEEKS TO COME BETWEEN NOW AND\nNOVEMBER 8th, THE DAY OF THE ELECTION?\n>> Reporter: I MEAN, WE DID EXPECT TO SEE MORE.\nREMEMBER A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO TALKING HOW PRESIDENT OBAMA\nWOULD LIKELY BE THE MOST ACTIVE PRESIDENT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL\nIN HISTORY, BUT WE REALLY HAVEN'T SEEN THAT.\nMAINLY BECAUSE OF HIS SCHEDULE. REMEMBER THAT FIRST EVENT\nPLANNED WITH HILLARY CLINTON HAD TO BE POSTPONED BECAUSE OF THE\nORLANDO SHOOTINGS. SO SOME UNFORESEEN EVENTS GOT IN\nTHE WAY AS WELL. THAT WAS SUCH A DIFFICULT TIME\nTHAT HE HAD TO FOCUS ON AND KIND OF COOL THINGS OFF A LITTLE BIT.\nAND WE SAW HIM OUT WITH HILLARY IN JULY AND, OF COURSE, TWO\nMONTHS AGO ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL THAT SEEMS LIKE AN ETERNITY, BUT\nHIS SCHEDULE IS STILL DIFFICULT THIS MONTH.\nWE JUST GOT BACK FROM A FOREIGN TRIP.\nHE HAS THE U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY COMING UP.\nIT'S REALLY GOING TO BE OCTOBER THAT WE SEE HIM ACTIVE.\nAND WE'VE SEEN REPORTS OUT THERE AND PEOPLE SPECULATING THAT HE\nMIGHT SPEND VIRTUALLY THE ENTIRE MONTH OUT ON THE TRAIL.\nOUR SOURCES SAY THAT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE POSSIBLE, FOR IT\nTO BE THAT THAT EXTENT, WE SURELY CAN EXPECT TO SEE MUCH,\nMUCH MORE OF HIM AS SOON AS WE SEE OCTOBER, WOLF.\n>> LIVE COVERAGE OF HIS REMARKS COMING UP.\nMICHELLE KACZYNSKI, THANK YOU. AND JASON CARROLL WITH DONALD\nTRUMP EXPECTED TO SPEAK MOMENTARILY.\nTHANK YOU TO YOU AS WELL. TRADING BLOWS OVER WHOSE\nCAMPAIGN IS LESS TRANSPARENT. IN AN INTERVIEW WITH CNN'S\nRNDSON COOPER, HILLARY CLINTON TRIED TO TURNTA THE TABLES ON\nTRUMP. >> YOU'VE GOT A MEDICAL REPORT\nON ME THAT MEETS THE SAME STANDARD AT MITT ROMNEY AND\nBARACK OBAMA. DONALD TRUMP'S DOCTOR SAID HE'D\nBE THE HEALTHIEST PRESIDENT IN HISTORY.\nTHAT'S JUST NOT EVEN SERIOUS. AND I'VE RELEASED NEARLY 40\nYEARS OF TAX RETURNS. HE HASN'T RELEASED ONE.\nTHIS IS A MAN WITH UNKNOWN NUMBERS OF PARTNERS AND\nINVESTORS WHO SAYS HE'S DOING 120 FOREIGN DEALS.\nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE TO KNOW WHAT HE'S UP TO AND WHAT HE\nIS HIDING. >> LET'S BRING IN OUR PANEL, OUR\nSENIOR POLITICAL REPORTER WITH US, \"TIME\" MAGAZINE POLITICAL\nREPORTER ZEKE MILLER AND \"WASHINGTON POST\" REPORTER ED\nO'KEEFE. THANKS FOR JOINING US.\nIS THIS AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY WE SAW HER DISPLAY LAST NIGHT IN\nTHE PHONE INTERVIEW WITH ANDERSON COOPER?\n>> I THINK SO. WE OBVIOUSLY KNOW SHE HAS\nTRANSPARENCY PROBLEMS AND THEY SHOW UP IN TRUSTWORTHY NUMBERS,\nIN THIS EPISODE WITH THE HEALTH ISSUE MAGNIFIED NAP IN TURNS THE\nTABLES ON DONALD TRUMP SHE HAS TO MAKE SURE HE'S GETTING\nQUESTIONS ABOUT HIS TAX RETURNS, THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN PUSHED THIS IDEA LONG AGO THAT DONALD TRUMP\nDOESN'T HAVE, ISN'T JUDGED BY THE SAME STANDARDS.\nRIGHT? THAT HE GETS A PASS ON MANY OF\nTHESE THINGS. THE PRESS SOMETIMES LET'S HIM\nGET A PASS. SO I THINK IN TRYING TO TURN THE\nCONVERSATION TO DONALD TRUMP, IT IS AFFECTED, AND WE'VE SEEN\nDONALD TRUMP TRYING TO DO THE SAME THING WITH HER.\nI THINK IT ALSO WATERS DOWN HIS KEY ARGUMENT ABOUT HER WHICH IS\nTHAT SHE'S THE ONE WHO'S GOT SOMETHING TO HIDE, SHE'S THE ONE\nLOOKING IN TRANSPARENCY. I THINK WE'LL CONTINUE TO SEE\nHER DO THAT AND DONALD TRUMP. >> HE'S UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE,\nZEKE TO RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS. SAYS HE CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE\nHE'S STILL UNDER IRS AUDIT. EARLIER THIS MORNING ON CNN'S\n\"NEW DAY\" ALISON CAM WRK ALSOAL CAMEROTA SAID --\n>> ARE YOU CALLING HIM A LIAR? >> TAKING HIS WORD FOR.\n>> IT AND TAKING HILLARY CLINTON'S WORD SHE WAS\nOVERHEATED AND DIDN'T HAVE PNEUMONIA OR IS GOING TO BE\nASPIRATIONAL, UPLIFTING, START TALKING TO THE PRESS.\nSERIOUSLY, WE'RE RUNNING AGAINST A CLINTON AND GOING TO CHALLENGE\nSOMEONE'S VERACITY? >> THAT WAS CAMPAIGN MANAGER\nKELLYANNE CONWAY BASICALLY SAYING HE'S UNDER AUDIT.\nARE YOU CALLING HIM A LIAR, IF YOU WANT PROOF.\nTHIS IS A SENSITIVE ISSUE FOR BOTH OF THESE CAMPAIGNS BUT\nHILLARY CLINTON RELEASED 20 YEARS OF HER IRS RETURNS.\n>> A LOT OF PLACE, IT'S BEEN A RACE TO THE BOT WHUM IT COMES TO\nPRESS ACCESS, TRANSPARENCY, VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE OF ANY SORT\nOF INFORMATION. FOR INSTANCE, THE BASKET OF\nDEPLORABLES COMMENT AT A FUND-RAISER HILLARY CLINTON HAD.\nTRADITIONALLY THESE, SPEAKING OF BREAKING WITH THE PRESIDENT FROM\nMITT ROMNEY AND PRESIDENT OBAMA, HILLARY CLINTON GENERALLY\nDOESN'T ALLOW PRESS IN HER FUND-RAISERS.\nIN TERMS OF GETTING INFORMATION OUT TO THE PRESS IN A TIMELY\nMANNER, SUNDAY MORNING, THE HEALTH EPISODE, SHE WAITED A\nWHILE BEFORE TELLING THE PRESS ABOUT IT.\nDONALD TRUMP AND TAX RETURNS, YES, ASKING PEOPLE TO TRUST HIM,\nAND YES, HE DOES GET A BUSINESS OF A PASS, MOSTLY FROM VOTERS,\nNOT THE PRESS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS NOW.\nHIS VOTERS RIGHT NOW DON'T CARE HE'S NOT RELEASING TAX RETURNS.\n>> THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES ARRIVING IN PHILADELPHIA,\nJUST MOMENTS AGO. HE'LL SPEAK SHORTLY, LATER THIS\nHOUR, IN PHILADELPHIA TO CAMPAIGN RALLY IN SUPPORT OF\nHILLARY CLINTON. ED, IS THERE ANY INDICATION AT\nALL YOU COVERED THIS VERY WELL, THAT DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO\nRELEASE AT LEAST SOME ASPECTS OF HIS TAX RETURNS?\nEASTERN THE YEARS THAT ARE, THAT ALREADY HAVE BEEN AUDITED?\nUP TO 2008. HE COULD RELEASE THOSE.\nHE COULD ALSO JUST RELEASE THE PERCENTAGE OF TAX HE PAID THE\nCHARITIABILITY CONTRIBUTIONS HE MADE.\nHE COULD RELEASE THAT KIND OF INFORMATION WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING\nHIS AUDIT? >> I'D SAY THE \"WASHINGTON POST\"\nHAS BEEN LOOKING AT THIS SPECIFICALLY, MY COLLEAGUE WOULD\nBE THRILLED TO SEE ALL THAT INFORMATION, BECAUSE IT'S LED TO\nREAMS OF REPORTING THAT INCLUDE NO COMMENT FROM THE CAMPAIGN,\nAND THUS LEAVES ALL OF THESE QUESTIONS OPEN.\nHE ABSOLUTELY COULD, AND MEDICAL INFORMATION AS WELL.\nTHE EXCUSE OF, WE, I MAY NOT HAVE GIVEN ANYTHING, BUT HE'S\nWORSE. SORRY.\nEVERYONE AT THIS TABLE, EVERYONE IN THIS BUILDING AND EVERY NEWS\nORGANIZATION SHOULD BE FURIOUS WITH BOTH OF THESE CAMPAIGNS FOR\nBEING SO SECRETIVE, FRANKLY, ABOUT THIS STUFF, AND IT WAS\nENCOURAGING TO SEE THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN ADMIT OVER THE WEEKEND\nPERHAPS THEY STUMBLED A BIT INFORMING US'S ALL OF THESE\nTHINGS BUT NO EXCUSE. THIS PERSON WANTS TO BE THE MOST\nPOWERFUL PERSON IN THE WORLD. VOTERS TRADITIONALLY WANT THIS.\nSUPPORTER",

WE'VE ALREADY MET A HIGH\nSTANDARD OF TRANSPARENCY AND WE KNOW THE LEAST ABOUT DONALD\nTRUMP OF ANY CANDIDATE IN RECENT AMERICAN HISTORY.\nKNOW VIRTUALLY NOTHING ABOUT HIS BUSINESS ENTANGLEMENTS, HIS\nFOREIGN INVESTORS. YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY PAST TIME\nFOR HIM TO BE HELD TO THE SAME STANDARD, NOT JUST AS ME, BUT OF\nEVERYBODY ELSE WHO HAS SOUGHT THIS JOB.\n>> THE FINAL QUESTION, I KNOW BOTH YOUR SUPPORTERS AND\nPROBABLY THOSE WHO ARE OPPOSED TO YOU WANT TO KNOW THE ANSWER\nTO IS, HOW QUICKLY, WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO GET BACK ON THE\nCAMPAIGN TRAIL? >> WELL, IT WILL BE THE NEXT\nCOUPLE OF DAYS. OBVIOUSLY, I WAS SUPPOSED TO\nREST FIVE DAYS. THAT'S WHAT THEY TOLD ME ON\nFRIDAY, AND I DIDN'T FOLLOW THAT VERY WISE ADVICE.\nSO I JUST WANT TO GET THIS OVER AND DONE WITH AND GET BACK ON\nTHE TRAIL AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. >> SECRETARY CLINTON, WE WISH\nYOU THE BEST AND A SPEEDY RECOVERY.\nTHANKS TO YOU SO MUCH FOR SPEAKING WITH US.\n>> THANK YOU. GOOD TO TALK TO YOU, ANDERSON.\nTHANKS A LOT. >> SECRETARY CLINTON IN HER\nFIRST INTERVIEW SINCE THE INCIDENT YESTERDAY.\nA LOT TO TALK ABOUT. WITH ME, FORMER MITT ROMNEY\nCAMPAIGN ADVISER, STUART STEVENS.\nCOREY LEWANDOWSKI. CLINTON SUPPORTER, NATIONAL\nMOVEON.ORG SPOKESPERSON, KARINE JEAN-PIERRE.\nAND GLORIA BORGER. KARINE, DO YOU THINK THIS HAS\nLASTING REPERCUSSIONS FOR SECRETARY CLINTON?\nIT DOES PLAY INTO, YOU KNOW, SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS AND\nNARRATIVE THAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING FROM DONALD TRUMP AND\nTHE DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN. DOES IT HAVE LASTING\nREPERCUSSIONS? >> I THINK IT HAS A -- IT'S A\nDISTRACTION, RIGHT, BUT NO LASTING EFFECT.\nLOOK, SHE HAS A COMMON ILLNESS THAT 5 MILLION TO 10 MILLION\nAMERICANS GET EVERY DAY, RIGHT, AND IN THE SHORT TERM SHE'LL GET\nOVER THIS AND SHE'LL MOVE ON. >> ISN'T IT MORE ABOUT HOW THE\nCAMPAIGN HANDLED IT AND NOT DISSEMINATING THE INFORMATION\nEVEN ON THAT DAY AFTER PEOPLE KNEW SOMETHING WAS GOING ON?\n>> THE CAMPAIGN HAS SAID THEMSELVES, LOOK, THEY COULD\nHAVE HANDLED THIS A LOT BETTER. THEY'RE RIGHT.\nTHEY COULD HAVE DONE THAT. ONE THING I WANTED TO POINT OUT,\nYOU HAD SANJAY GUPTA IN THE 8:00 HOUR.\nHE WAS ABLE TO LIST OUT ALL OF THE MEDICATIONS THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON TAKES AND THE REASON WHY IS BECAUSE SHE ACTUALLY PUT OUT\nA MEDICAL REPORT. ARE WE ABLE TO DO THAT FOR\nTRUMP? NO.\nWE CAN'T. BECAUSE WHAT HE PUT OUT ACTUALLY\nHAS NO SUBSTANCE. SO THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF A\nDOUBLE STANDARD HERE. >> COREY, THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN\nCERTAINLY IS TRYING TO SWITCH THIS TO FOCUS ON DONALD TRUMP,\nAND THE DISPARITIES BETWEEN WHAT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS\nRELEASED AND WHAT, YOU KNOW, THEIR VIEW OF WHAT DONALD TRUMP\nHAS RELEASED. >> LOOK, WHAT THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN DOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT, AT A PRIVATE FUND-RAISER\nON FRIDAY NIGHT, SHE CALLED PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP\nA BASKET OF DEPLORABLES. THAT'S 14 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE\nPRIMARY. >> SHE DID APOLOGIZE, THE FACT\nSHE SAID NOT HALF. >> WHICH MEANS -- IT'S A GROSS\nGENERAL STATION. IF THIS STORY WASN'T DOMINATING\nTHE NEWS COVERAGE RIGHT NOW WHICH IS HER ALMOST PASSING OUT\nAT THE 9/11 MEMORIAL, THAT'S WHAT YOU'D BE TALKING ABOUT\nTODAY. REALLY THAT'S AKIN TO MITT\nROMNEY'S 47% STATEMENT THAT WAS MADE FOUR YEARS AGO AND WHAT IT\nIS IS IT'S A GROSS GENERALIZATION, SOMETHING THAT\nREALLY ISN'T APPROPRIATE SO I THINK AS MUCH AS THE HILLARY\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN DOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE HEALTH ISSUE, I\nTHINK THEY'D RATHER BE TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE THAN THE\nSTATEMENT SHE MADE FRIDAY NIGHT ABOUT THE PEOPLE SUPPORTING THE\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN. >> IT'S NOT THE SAME.\nTHE 40% WAS BASICALLY A NARRATIVE THAT TOLD HOW MITT\nROMNEY WAS RICH AND DISCONNECTED, RIGHT?\nIT WAS ABOUT THE WEALTHY. WHAT SHE TALKED ABOUT,\nDEPLORABLES, WAS ABOUT THE BIGOTRY OF DONALD TRUMP.\nHOW THAT NARRATIVE IS, RELATES TO HIM.\nLOOK, SO, LOOK, LET'S BE CLEAR HERE, THERE IS AN ELEMENT,\nRIGHT, OF DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTERS THAT ARE DEPLORABLE,\nRIGHT? >> THAT'S EGREGIOUS.\nTHEY'RE NOT. YOU KNOW WHAT --\n>> THEY ARE. THEY ARE.\nWHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT GETTING DAVID DUKE SUPPORT --\n>> HE DOESN'T HAVE DAVID DUKE SUPPORT.\nHE DOESN'T WANT DAVID DUKE SUPPORT.\n>> WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE AT HIS RALLIES WHO ARE TALKING ABOUT\nWHITE POWER, WE'VE SEEN THIS FOOTAGE SAYING, YELLING WHITE\nPOWER. WHEN YOU HAVE CONFEDERATE\nFLAG -- >> YOU HAVE AT A HILLARY CLINTON\nRALLY DIRECTLY BEHIND HER THE FATHER OF THE LARGEST MASS\nMURDERER IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA'S HISTORY.\n>> THAT WAS ONE -- >> SHE ACCOUNTABLE FOR HIM?\n>> LET ME BRING IN STUART AND GLORIA.\nSTUART, I MEAN, CLEARLY THIS HAS TAKEN THE ATTENTION AWAY FROM\nWHAT HILLARY CLINTON SAID ON FRIDAY ABOUT HALF THE TRUMP\nSUPPORTERS BEING THIS BASKET OF DEPLORABLES.\n>> WELL, IT'S AN ELOQUENT THEORY THAT SHE GOT SICK TO TAKE THE --\n>> OF COURSE NOT. IT WASN'T INTENTIONAL, BUT --\n>> I -- I -- YOU KNOW, LISTEN, CAMPAIGNS USUALLY AREN'T\nAFFECTED BY THESE STORIES ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.\nWE TALK ABOUT THE 47% STORY. IT WAS A BIG STORY.\nTHERE'S REALLY NO EVIDENCE WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT, IF IT HADN'T\nHAPPENED THAT MITT ROMNEY WOULD HAVE WON.\nYOU KNOW, WHEN YOU GET IN THESE CAMPAIGNS, YOU HAVE TO REALLY\nTREAT IT THE SAME WAY NFL QUARTERBACKS TREAT THROWING\nINTERCEPTIONS. YOU THROW INTERCEPTIONS.\nYOU JUST PLAY THE NEXT PLAY. NO CAMPAIGN DOESN'T MAKE\nMISTAKES. IT'S A MATTER OF PUSHING THROUGH\nAND BEING ABLE TO TRY TO COMMUNICATE WITH AS MANY VOTERS\nAS YOU CAN WHY YOU THINK YOU SHOULD BE PRESIDENT.\nI DON'T THINK THESE LITTLE THINGS ARE GOING TO MAKE THAT\nMUCH DIFFERENCE. >> GLORIA, TO STUART'S POINT,\nWE'RE FOCUSED ON THE MINUTIA OF WHAT'S HAPPENING EVERY SECOND.\n>> RIGHT. >> I HAVE NO LIFE, THIS IS WHAT\nI DO. I'M NOT GOING TO SPEAK TO\nEVERYBODY ELSE ON THE PANEL. >> YOU CAN.\n>> YOU SEEM TO HAVE MORE LIVES THAN I DO.\nMOST PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY HAVE REAL JOBS UNLIKE ME AND ARE OUT\nTHERE WORKING HARD AND HAVE KIDS AND A MILLION THINGS THEY GOT TO\nTAKE CARE OF AND ARE NOT FOLLOWING THE MINUTIA LIKE I AM\nAND MANY OF US ARE. I GUESS TO STUART'S POINT, DOES\nTHIS REALLY MATTER? >> I THINK WHAT IT DOES IS IT\nAFFIRMS HOW YOU FEEL OR DON'T FEEL ABOUT SOMEBODY.\nI DON'T THINK HILLARY CLINTON'S BOUT WITH PNEUMONIA IN AND OF\nITSELF IS GOING TO CHANGE ONE VOTE AT ALL.\nBUT I DO BELIEVE THAT IF YOU BELIEVE SHE HAS A PENCHANT FOR\nSECRECY AND WANTS TO KEEP THINGS FROM THE AMERICAN PUBLIC AND\nHIDES THINGS AND IS DEVIOUS, YOU WILL SAY THIS IS PART OF THAT\nWHOLE NARRATIVE. AND, YOU KNOW, THE MOST\nINTERESTING THING TO ME ABOUT ALL OF THIS IS THAT WE DON'T\nHAVE DONALD TRUMP OUT THERE TALKING ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S\nHEALTH WHICH HE'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN.\nINSTEAD, WHEN THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT SHE HAD A HEALTH ISSUE, THE\nPNEUMONIA, AND THAT THE PRESS WAS KEPT AWAY FROM KNOWING ABOUT\nIT, WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT? HE'S TALKING ABOUT WHAT WORKS\nFOR HIM WHICH IS WHAT COREY WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT.\nAND WHICH IS THE BASKET OF DEPLORABLES BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT\nWILL MOTIVATE HIS BASE TO GET OUT AND VOTE.\nSO, YOU KNOW, AT THIS POINT -- >> WELL, ALSO IT'S THE AGE-OLD,\nYOU KNOW, POLITICAL IDEA OF WHEN THE OTHER CAMPAIGN IS STUMBLING,\nYOU JUST STEP OUT OF THE WAY. ALLOW THEM TO KIND OF, YOU KNOW,\nCONTINUE TO STUMBLE. YOU DON'T NEED TO ADD TO IT\nBECAUSE, IN FACT, YOU COULD, YOU KNOW, STOP THE STUMBLE.\nWE GOT TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK. >> RIGHT.\n>> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE WITH THE PANEL AHEAD.\nDONALD TRUMP WRAPPED UP A RALLY IN NORTH CAROLINA EARLIER\nTONIGHT. AS WE MENTIONED, HE WAS SLAMMING\nCLINTON ON HER COMMENT ABOUT SOME OF HIS SUPPORTERS.\nWHAT HE SAID TONIGHT, AHEAD.",

HE TWEETED, \"ANTIBIOTICS CAN\nTAKE CARE OF PNEUMONIA, WHAT'S THE CURE FOR AN UNHEALTHY\nPENCHANT FOR PRIVACY THAT REPEATEDLY CREATES UNNECESSARY\nPROBLEMS?\" WHY NOT JUST SAY ON FRIDAY AS\nYOU SAID APPARENTLY TO SENATOR SCHUMER ON SUNDAY, YOU KNOW, I\nHAVE PNEUMONIA, FOLKS, I'M GOING TO POWER THROUGH IT.\nWHY KEEP IT A SECRET? >> WELL, I JUST DIDN'T THINK IT\nWAS GOING TO BE THAT BIG A DEAL.

ALL KINDS OF PERSONAL DETAILS.\nAND, YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST SO -- IT'S SO STRANGE THAT WITH ALL OF\nTHAT INFORMATION OUT THERE, AND AS SOON AS IT BECAME CLEAR I\nCOULDN'T POWER THROUGH, WE, YOU KNOW, WE SAID WHAT WAS GOING ON.\n>> YEAH, BUT WHEN YOU -- >> DONALD TRUMP IS --\n>> SORRY. >> WHAT?\n>> WHEN YOU LEFT YOUR DAUGHTER'S APARTMENT, YOU SAID YOU WERE\nFEELING GREAT.

I THINK IT'S TIME HE MET THE\nSAME LEVEL OF DISCLOSURE THAT I HAVE FOR YEARS.\nYOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT A MEDICAL REPORT ON ME THAT MEETS THE SAME\nSTANDARD AS MITT ROMNEY AND BARACK OBAMA.\nDONALD TRUMP'S DOCTOR SAID HE'D BE THE HEALTHIEST PRESIDENT IN\nHISTORY. THAT'S JUST NOT EVEN SERIOUS.\nAND I'VE RELEASED NEARLY 40 YEARS OF TAX RETURNS.\nHE HASN'T RELEASED ONE. THIS IS A MAN WITH UNKNOWN\nNUMBERS OF PARTNERS AND INVESTORS WHO SAYS HE'S DOING\n120 FOREIGN DEALS.

              "text": ">>> GUYS, THANKS SO MUCH.\nWELCOME TO \"THE HALFTIME REPORT.\"\nI'M SCOTT WAPNER LIFE TODAY FROM CNBC. SIXTH ANNUAL DELIVERING ALPHA\nCONFERENCE TODAY IN NEW YORK CITY.\nCARL ICAHN TO RAY DALIO ARE SHARING THEIR IDEAS RIGHT HERE.\nWITH US FOR THE HOUR JOE TERRA NOVA, JOSH BROWN, AND STEVEN\nWEISS. MARKETS, AS YOU KNOW, ARE HAVING\nA VERY DIFFICULT DAY. THE DOW HAS BEEN DOWN ABOUT 250\nPOINTS. DOW AND THE S&P LOOKING AT THEIR\nFOUR OUT OF FIVE DOWN DAYS NOW. THERE'S THE DOW DOWN CURRENTLY\n246. THE S&P AND THE NASDAQ AND THE\nRUSSELL, WHICH IS DOWN 2% TAKING A LITTLE BIT HARDER TODAY.\nGIVE YOU A CHECK ON OIL AND GOLD AND BONDS TOO.\nTHERE'S SO MUCH CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT THE FED MAY DO.\nEVEN HERE AT DELIVERING ALPHA HAVE YOU HEARD FROM SOME OF THE\nLARGEST AND MOST RESPECTED MONEY MANAGERS IN THE WORLD WITH THEIR\nCOMMENTARY ON THE FED AND THE MARKETS.\nWE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT. ALSO WORD TODAY THAT ATLANTA FED\nPRESIDENT DENNIS LOCKHART IS STEPPING DOWN FROM HIS POST IN\nFEBRUARY. THAT IS BIG NEWS.\nTHAT'S WHY WE HAVE SENIOR ECONOMICS REPORTER STEVE LIESMAN\nJOINING US ON SET AS WELL. LET'S DISCUSS WHAT'S TAKING\nPLACE IN THE MARKET. IT'S BEEN AN INTERESTING FEW\nDAYS. JOSH, VOLATILITY IS BACK, AND IT\nIS BACK IN A BIG WAY. >> NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.\nYOU HAD THESE GIANT BULLISH CANDLES EVERYWHERE YESTERDAY.\nWE HAD ERASED ALL OF THE LOSS, AND IN SOME AREAS WE WERE\nACTUALLY GAINING FROM THURSDAY NIGHT'S CLOSE.\nWHEN YOU SEE THAT KIND OF ACTION AND THEN THE NEXT DAY IT'S\nCOMPLETELY NEGATED AS THOUGH IT NEVER HAPPENED, THAT TELLS YOU\nSOMETHING BIG IS GOING ON. WE LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF THESE\nKINDS OF MINUS ONE, PLUS ONE, MINUS ONE AGAIN DAYS NEAR\nALL-TIME HIGHS. THIS HAS ONLY HAPPENED FIVE\nTIMES. I DON'T KNOW 100% WHAT IT MEANS,\nBUT WHEN YOU SEE THE TLT LOOKING AWFUL BACK INTO THE POST-BREXIT\nGAP, AND YOU SEE VAN GARDE REAL ESTATE DOWN 8.5% FROM THE HIGHS,\nYOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS AS A RATE-RELATED ADJUSTMENT BECAUSE\nTHE CUES, THE GROWTH STOCKS, ARE HANGING IN MUCH BETTER THAN THE\nYIELD PROXIES. >> IT MEANS BUCKLE UP.\nI MEAN, INVESTORS, JOE, NEED TO BUCKLE THEIR SEAT BELTS, PUT\nTHEIR SHOULDER STRAP ON. I MEAN, MAYBE IF YOU ARE A RACE\nCAR DRIVER, YOU NEED TO HARNESS IN TOO BECAUSE IT COULD GET EVEN\nMORE VOLATILE FROM HERE. >> I DESCRIBED YESTERDAY AS A\nTRADING EVENT, AND WE'VE NOW GRAVITATED TOWARDS IF YOU ARE A\nMONEY MANAGER, YOU NEED TO BE PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT'S GOING\nON TODAY. IF YOU DID NOT LIKE FRIDAY, YOU\nDO NOT LIKE TODAY. I THINK THE PROBLEM WAS WAKING\nUP THIS MORNING AT 4:30 AND LOOKING AT THE ASIAN MARKETS AND\nSEEING THEM REALLY GIVE UP THE STRONG GAMES.\nTHERE WAS NO REBOUNDS OVERSEAS. PEOPLE REALLY DON'T WANT\nEQUITIES UNLESS THEY'RE DOMESTICALLY FOCUSED.\nTHAT'S WHERE I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A PROBLEM GOING FORWARD.\nWE'RE IN A VACUUM PERIOD. THE RIGHT STRATEGY IS TO RAISE\nCASH LEVELS RIGHT NOW. YOU TAKE YOUR EQUITY HOLDINGS\nBACK. PROBABLY SOMEWHERE AROUND 20% IN\nCASH. YOU HAVE TO CLEARLY PAY\nATTENTION TODAY. AS I SAID YESTERDAY, IT WAS A\nTRADING EVENT. I THINK I MIGHT BE WRONG ABOUT\nTHAT. I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING BIGGER\nTHAT'S DEVELOPING HERE. BILL MILLER WAS ON THE STAGE\nLESS THAN FIVE MINUTES AGO SAYING THAT HIS BEST IDEA RIGHT\nNOW IS LONG THE S&P 500 AND SHORT TREASURIES.\nYET, YOU'VE HEARD OTHER OPINIONS FROM THE LIKES OF PAUL SINGER\nAND RAY DALIO PERHAPS. WE'LL HEAR FROM THEM IN A\nMOMENT. YOUR THOUGHTS FIRST.\n>> THAT WAS SURPRISING. JOSH AND I WERE BOTH STANDING\nTHERE WATCHING BILL MILLER, AND I THINK HE WERE WITH BOTH\nSURPRISED THAT THAT WAS HIS BEST IDEA TO COME OUT.\nNOT THE OTHER SIDE. NOT THE SELL BONDS SIDE, BUT THE\nS&P SIDE. I THINK WHAT PAUL SINGER CAME\nOUT AND SAID WAS MUCH MORE TYPICAL OF WHAT I HAVE HEARD IN\nMY CONVERSATION AND OTHER CONFERENCES I HAVE BEEN AT,\nWHICH IS HIS BEST IDEA WAS TAKE RISK OFF.\nSELL G-7 LONG DURATION BONDS. I'VE DONE WHAT JOE HAS\nSUGGESTED, WHICH I MENTIONED YESTERDAY.\nI'VE TAKEN CAPITAL OFF. ONE OF MY CONCERNS HAS BEEN\nCOMPLACE ENSY IN THE MARKETS, AND I THINK WE'RE SEEING THAT\nCOMPLACE ENSY COME OUT AGAIN TODAY.\nIF YOU HAD ASKED ME YESTERDAY AFTER BRAINERD CAME OUT AND\nTRIED TO THROW COLD WATER ON IT, I WONDER IF YELLIN PUT HIM UP ON\nIT OR NOT, I HAVE TAKEN DOWN MY ODDS OF A TIGHTENING LATER THIS\nMONTH. I STILL THINK IT WILL HAPPEN.\nI WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE MARKET WOULD HAVE HAD SOME\nFOLLOW-THROUGH TODAY. HOWEVER, WE'RE BACK TO THE\nCORRELATION WITH CRUDE. CRUDE SELLS OFF MEANINGFULLY\nOVER 3%, AND THE MARKET TAKES A DIVE.\nI THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO POINT TO.\nTHE OTHER THING -- I THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT -- IS THAT YOU\nCAN'T DISASSOCIATE POLITICS AND THE POLLS GETTING TIGHTER AND\nHILLARY NOW BECOMING -- YOU KNOW, THE PNEUMONIA WITH WHAT'S\nHAPPENING IN THE MARKETS. IT'S BECOMING MORE OF A REALITY.\nI THINK THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO DRIVE THE VOLATILITY AND\nCONTINUE TO DRIVE IT THROUGH ELECTIONS.\n>> WE'VE REFERENCED PAUL SINGER A COUPLE OF TIMES NOW.\nWE MIGHT AS WELL LISTEN TO THE SOUND THAT HE HAD TODAY.\nOF COURSE, THE FAMED HEDGE FUND MANAGER HAD ALREADY SAID THAT\nWE'RE IN THE MIDST OF THE BIGGEST BOND BUBBLE IN HISTORY,\nBUT HERE'S WHAT HE SAID ABOUT HOW HE VIEWS THE WORLD RIGHT\nNOW, AND A DANGEROUS ONE AT THAT.\n>> WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IS CREATED A TREMENDOUS INCREASE IN\nHIDDEN RISK. A RISK THAT INVESTORS DON'T\nEXACTLY KNOW OR HAVE FACED ABOUT THEIR HOLDINGS, AND I THINK IT'S\nA VERY DANGEROUS TIME IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND GLOBAL\nFINANCIAL MARKETS. >> THAT'S PAUL SINGER RIGHT\nTHERE. I GOT STEVE LIESMAN NEXT TO ME\nTOO. THEY BEING IN PART, THE FED.\nNOT JUST THE FED, BUT CENTRAL BANKS AROUND THE WORLD.\nTHE ACTIONS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE, IT'S JUST A DANGEROUS\nTIME RIGHT NOW GIVEN THE THREAT OF PULLING THAT AWAY.\n>> TREASURIES ARE NOT THE RISK-FREE ASSET, AND THAT\nCREATES -- >> SAFE HAVENS AREN'T SUCH.\n>> THERE'S NO SAFE IN THE HAVEN THERE OR NO HAVEN IN THE SAFE.\nIT CREATES A GROUNDLESS INVESTMENT MATRIX IN THAT ALL\nINVESTMENTS ARE JUDGED FROM THE RISK-FREE RETURN.\nIT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO KNOW IF STOCKS ARE OVER OR UNDER VALUED\nRELATIVE TO WHAT COULD BE A VERY POTENTIALLY VOLATILE MOVEMENT IN\nLONG BONDS WHEN IT COMES TO THE YIELD.\nWHAT TROUBLES ME, THOUGH, IS I THINK SINGER IS A LITTLE BIT\nMORE PESSIMISTIC THAN HE OUGHT TO BE IN THAT I THINK THAT MORE\nOR LESS, THE RETURNS ON THE TEN-YEAR ARE AT LEAST TO A 70 OR\n80% DEGREE DETERMINED BY THE MARKET.\nIF THE FED WERE TO STOP REALLY TRYING TO KEEP INTEREST RATES\nDOWN, I DON'T THINK THEY WOULD SKYROCKET TO 3%.\n>> ONE OF THE POINTS THAT HE MADE WAS THAT YOU COULD HAVE\nBOTH STOCKS AND BONDS FALLING TOGETHER, AND THAT WOULD BE A\nREVERSAL OF WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON NOW WHERE STOCKS AND BONDS HAVE\nGONE UP. >> AND THEN THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT\nCENTRAL BANK POLICIES HAVE DONE. IT HAS MADE A MONEY MANAGER VERY\nUNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE YOU ARE TAKING CORRELATIONS BACK TO\nWHERE EVERYTHING IS CLOSE TO ONE.\nEVERYTHING GOES UP TOGETHER. EVERYTHING GOES DOWN TOGETHER\nLIKE IT IS TODAY. THAT'S THE PROBLEM LOOKING\nFORWARD BECAUSE YOU LOSE THE HEDGING OPTIONS.\nIT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON TODAY IN\nOIL AND THINK ABOUT LAST WEEK. WHERE WE ARE ON THURSDAY WITH\nTHE NUMBER THEY CAME OUT AND EVERYONE SAYING, OH, LOOK AT\nOIL. THE BIGGEST DRAWDOWN SINCE 1999,\nGOING THROUGH 50. EVERYONE POSITIONED THE WRONG\nWAY. BRINGING IN THE CORRELATION TO\nONE. >> I ALWAYS PUZZLE OVER IT, ASK\nAPPROXIMATE PEOPLE SAY, OH, THEY GET IT.\nTO ME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE GREED TRADE AND THE FEAR TRADE\nARE SIMULTANEOUSLY OVERVALUED. YOU HAVE A TON OF PEOPLE WHO\nHAVE PILED INTO BONDS IN PART BECAUSE THEY'RE SCARED OF\nSTOCKS, THEY'RE SCARED OF THE FUTURE.\nTHEY'RE LOOKING FOR A RISK-FREE ASSET.\nAS A RESULT, THEY'VE CREATED A NON-RISK-FREE ASSET, AND VERY\nFEW PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO GO WITH THE STOCKS.\n>> I DON'T KNOW IF I AGREE IT'S A NONRISK-FREE ASSET.\nWHEN PEOPLE USE THE BLANKET TERM TREASURIES, WHAT ARE WE TALKING\nABOUT? T-BILLS ARE ACTING AS A RISK-OFF\nRIGHT NOW. THEY'RE DOING THEIR JOB.\nIF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 20-YEAR PLUS, NO, YOU SHOULDN'T EXPECT\nTHAT TO BE THE RISK-FREE IF, IN FACT, LONG-TERM BOND YIELDS ARE\nAT THE FOCAL POINT OF WHAT PEOPLE ARE PANICKING OVER.\n>> LET'S MAKE IT ACTIONABLE THEN.\nIF YOU CAN'T INVEST IN STOCKS BECAUSE THEY LOOK EXPENSIVE AND\nTHEY COULD GO DOWN IF THE FED HIKES AND YOU MAY NOT WANT TO\nINVEST IN BONDS BECAUSE YOU ARE AFRAID THAT THEY GO DOWN AND\nRATES COULD GO UP IF THE FED HIKES, WHAT DO YOU DO?\n>> YOU ENDURE -- LISTEN, YOU ENDURE SOME DEGREE OF SHORT-TERM\nVOLATILITY. IT'S THE ONLY ANSWER.\nTHE OTHER ANSWER IS YOU TRY TO MARKET TIME WITHIN AN ENTIRE\nPORTFOLIO, WHICH YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO.\n>> ONE OF THE THINGS YOU CAN DO IS YOU COULD PLAY FOR VOLATILITY\nTO INCREASE, BUT, AGAIN, THE THING THAT IS MAKING EVERYONE\nUNCOMFORTABLE RIGHT NOW IS AS A MONEY MANAGER, HOW DO YOU LAY\nOFF YOUR RISK? THAT'S THE FIRST MANDATE YOU\nHAVE WHEN YOU ARE MANAGING MONEY.\nYOU ANALYZE YOUR RISK. HOW DO I LAY OFF MY RISK?\nTHAT'S THE CHALLENGE FOR YOU RIGHT NOW BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DO\nIT USING THE HISTORICAL ASSET CLASSES.\nYOU CAN'T DO IT LAYING OFF ON THE CURRENCY MARKET OR LAYING IT\nOFF IN TREASURIES. YOU CAN LOOK AT VOLATILITY RIGHT\nNOW. >> IT ALSO DEPENDS WHAT YOUR\nBASIS IS, TAX BASIS IS. YOU CAN'T GO TO CASH IF YOU HAVE\nA LOW TAX BASIS AND PAY TAXES. FOR NEW CAPITAL, I COULD WAIT\nFOR -- >> I WANT TO REPRESENT BECAUSE\nWHAT SCOTT LEFT OUT OF HIS EQUATION THERE, WHICH HAS TO BE\nPART OF THE CONVERSATION IS YOU CAN'T GO INTO STOCKS BECAUSE --\nYOU ALSO CAN'T BE IN CASH. YOU LOST ALL OF THE RETURN.\nLET ME EXPLAIN. THIS IS IMPORTANT.\nFOR EIGHT OR NINE YEARS IF YOU HAD THIS PESSIMISTIC VIEW ON HOW\nIT WAS ALL GOING TO END UP WITH THE FED, YOU LOST A LOT OF\nMONEY. YOU ARE WELL BEHIND THE CURVE\nBECAUSE OF THAT REAL FEAR THAT YOU HAD, AND I THINK THAT\nREMAINS AN ISSUE. >> THIS CONVERSATION IS NOT\nABOUT SHOULD YOU GO INTO EQUITIES.\nIT'S IF YOU ARE IN EQUITIES, WHAT DO YOU DO NOW?\nMOST OF OUR VIEWERS AND MOST OF THOSE HERE TODAY, THEY'RE FULLY\nINVESTED IN EQUITIES THEY'VE BEEN ENJOYING THIS SEVEN-YEAR\nRIDE HIGHER. WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THAT?\n>> THERE ARE THOSE -- ON THAT POINT I WAS GOING TO SAY PEOPLE\nLIKE CARL ICAHN AND THIS WHOLE NOTION OF TINA.\nTHERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE. HIS THING IS THAT'S MALARKEY.\nYOU COULD BE IN CASH. BEING IN CASH IN A LOW RATE\nENVIRONMENT IS BETTER THAN LOSING IN EQUITY.\nIF THE MARKET IS GOING TO HAVE AN ASYMMETRIC DISLOCATION, THEN\nBEING IN CASH IS OKAY. >> THE MAJORITY OF INVESTORS\nALREADY AGREE TO THAT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT FLOWS, WHEN YOU\nLOOK AT WHERE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES, FINANCIAL\nADVISORS, PLANNERS, WHERE ARE THEY ALLOCATING, THEY'RE NOT\nTHROWING MONEY AT THE SPY. THEY'RE IN VARIOUS STRATA OF\nBOND PRODUCTS. PRIME FUNDS, SHORT-TERM\nTREASURIES, ET CETERA. NOBODY THINKS NOW IS THE TIME TO\nBE 100% STOCKS. >> THERE'S NO SIZE FITS ALL.\nIT DEPENDS ON YOUR AGE, YOUR RISK TOLERANCE, YOUR VOLATILITY\nTOLERANCE. >> LET ME GET TO THE OTHER NEWS\nOF THE DAY, AS IF IT'S AN AFTERTHOUGHT, WHICH IT'S NOT,\nAND THAT'S DENNIS LOCKHART. >> THIS IS A PROFOUND\nCONVERSATION. THIS REALLY GETS AT THE HEART OF\nTHE QUANDRY OF INVESTMENT. PART OF BEING A D.A. HERE --\n>> LOCKHART IS LEAVING IN FEBRUARY.\n>> LOCKHART IS LEAVING IN FEBRUARY.\nHE IS A CENTRIST ON THE BOARD. ONE OF THE FEW NON-ECONOMISTS\nOUT THERE. THERE'S NO TIMETABLE TO APPOINT\nHIM. WE'RE GOING TO LEARN A LITTLE\nBIT MORE ABOUT THE PROCESS IN OCTOBER.\nI GUESS IT'S A COUPLE OF WEEKS FROM NOW.\nLOCKHART HAS BEEN AT THE FED SINCE 2007.\nHE IS A GUY I HAVE KNOWN FOR A VERY LONG TIME.\nA GUY WHO YOU FOLLOW WHEN YOU WANT TO KNOW IF IT'S A CLOSE\nDECISION. IF DENNIS IS LEANING TOWARDS A\nHIKE, IT'S LIKELY GOING TO BE A HIKE BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE A",

              "text": "SEVERE, NOT QUITE AS SEVERE AS\nFRIDAY. THIS WOULD BE THE THIRD IN A\nROW. AT ONE POINT A FEW MOMENTS AGO\nON THE S&P 500, THERE WERE 16 -- THAT'S ONE SIX -- COMPONENTS IN\nTHE GREEN. OIL, BY THE WAY, DOWN 3%, TOO.\n>> OIL AND FOCUS YET AGAIN. WE JUST DIPPED BELOW 30 A\nBARREL. IEA FORECAST WAS NOT WHAT\nINVESTORS WERE HOPING FOR. WE'LL SEE HOW THE OPEC LEADERS\nAND ALL THEIR JOB EARNING OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS CAN\nDIRECTIONALLY MOVE THE MARKET. 45 BUCKS, THOUGH, IS WHAT A LOT\nOF PRODUCERS, BETWEEN 45 AND 50, A SWEET SPOT FOR WHETHER THEY'RE\nACTUALLY ABLE TO MAKE MONEY. >> JIM'S POINT, OF COURSE, IN\nTHE 9:00 AM SHOW, AS YOU ENTER THIS BLACKOUT WINDOW LEADING UP\nTO THE FED MEETING, OIL DOES REALLY DRIVE THE NARRATIVE.\nAND THAT RESULTED IN YESTERDAY'S RALLY.\nWE CERTAINLY DO NOT HAVE BRAINARD SPEAKING TODAY.\nDAVID IS BACK WITH A LOT MORE ON A BUSY DAY.\nHEY, DAVID. >> HEY, CARL, THAT'S RIGHT.\nBREAK GOING ON HERE. YOU CAN HEAR THE SOUND BEHIND\nME. STOCKS IN THE RED AS OIL PRICES\nCONTINUE TO SLIDE, CAUSING THE DOW, S&P AS WELL DOWN WELL OVER\n1%. FED OFFICIALS REMAINING DIVIDED\nAHEAD OF THE NEXT POLICY MEETING THAT STARTS NEXT TUESDAY.\nWHAT AREA SHOULD INVESTORS BE FOCUSING THEIR ATTENTION ON?\nDAWN FITZPATRICK, GLOBAL HEAD OF AT ASSET MANAGEMENT AND MOST 21\nPOWERFUL WOMEN IN FINANCE. THAT'S OKAY, TOO.\nLOT OF GUYS AND LADIES SHOWING UP SAYING WHY THEY CAN'T DELIVER\nALPHA. DOES THAT CONTINUE?\n>> THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE ALPHA IN THE MARKETS.\nI THINK WHAT WE'VE SEEN OF LATE IS THAT ALPHAS ARE DOMINATED BY\nTHE MACRO. CERTAIN HEDGE FUND STRATEGIES WE\nSAW CROWDING. INVESTOR MONEY RETURNS AND MOST\nHEDGE FUND STRATEGIES ARE RELATIVE VALUE.\nYOU GET AN EXCESS RETURN, FLOOD OF MONEY AND THE RETURN GOES\nAWAY AND THE MONEY LEAVES AND THEN THE RETURNS COME BACK.\n>> PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PREDICTING THE DEMISE OF THE HEDGE FUND\nINDUSTRY FOR SOME TIME. THAT HASN'T HAPPENED.\nASSETS HAVE ACTUALLY MOVED IN. THIS YEAR, CERTAINLY ANOTHER ONE\nWHERE ACTIVELY MANAGED HEDGE FUNDS, CERTAINLY THE LONG/SHORT\nVARIETY ARE UNDERPERFORMING THEIR BENCHMARKS AND WELL SO.\nIS THERE EVER GOING TO BE SOME SORT OF A TIPPING POINT WHERE\nFEES COME UNDER SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE AND ASSETS REALLY DO\nSTART TO MOVE OUT OF THIS AREA AS SOME OF THE INSTITUTIONS AND\nOTHERS WHO INVEST IN HEDGE FUNDS SAY WHAT ARE WE DOING?\n>> I DO THINK HEDGE FUND FEES WILL COME DOWN.\nINVESTORS ARE GETTING A LOT SMARTER ABOUT DECOMPOSING ALPHA\nAND BETA. IN OTHER WORDS, THE MAJORITY OF\nHEDGE FUNDS ARE TYPICAL EQUITY LONG HEDGE FUNDS WHERE THE\nUNDERPERFORMANCE HAS BEEN THE MOST PRONOUNCED.\nWHAT INVESTORS ARE STARTING TO DO, THEY CAN BUY BETA FOR A\nCOUPLE OF BASIS POINTS. THEY WANT TO PAY FOR THE EXCESS\nRETURN. SO I THINK THAT KIND OF\nDELINEATION WILL PUT FEE PRESSURE ON THE INDUSTRY.\nBUT I'M REALLY IN THE CAMP THAT THE HEDGE FUND INDUSTRY TWO\nYEARS FROM NOW WILL BE LARGER, NOT SMALLER.\n>> WHY? >> BECAUSE IT'S REALLY\nIMPORTANT. IF DONE RIGHT, IT'S A REALLY\nIMPORTANT DIVERSIFIER IN THE CONTEXT OF AN OVERALL PORTFOLIO.\nAGAIN, THE OTHER THING YOU'LL START TO SEE IS DIVERGENCE OF\nRETURNS ACROSS TRADITIONAL ASSET CLASSES.\nHAVING SOMEONE WHO CAN ACTIVELY ALLOCATE AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF\nOPPORTUNITIES, I THINK, IS GOING TO ADD VALUE AND BE REALLY\nIMPORTANT ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE RETURN TARGETS OF, YOU\nKNOW, 7% TO 8%. >> DOES IT SAY SOMETHING ABOUT\nYOUR VIEW ON THE OVERALL MACRO AND MARKET ENVIRONMENT, THAT YOU\nEXPECT HEDGE FUNDS TO GROW THE NEXT FEW YEARS IN TERMS OF WHAT\nYOUR EXPECTATIONS ARE FOR RETURNS AND VARIOUS ASSET\nCLASSES? >> YEAH.\nI THINK RETURNS ARE GOING TO BE CHALLENGED ACROSS ASSET CLASSES\nAND OVERALL RETURN EXPECTATIONS, ABSOLUTELY, ARE GOING TO COME\nDOWN. YOU KNOW, AGAIN, THAT SAID I DO\nTHINK THERE ARE GOING TO BE POCKETS OF GREAT OPPORTUNITIES\nIN THE HEDGE FUND SPACE RIGHT NOW.\nONE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES I THINK IS REALLY ATTRACTIVE IS MERGR\nARBITRAGE. >> NO KIDDING.\nWHY IS THAT? >> CLASSIC SUPPLY AND DEMAND\nBALANCE. ACTIVITY DOWN A LITTLE BIT FROM\nLAST YEAR BUT THE NUMBER OF DEALS OVER $10 MILLION IS\nACTUALLY UP 50% FROM THE LAST CYCLE AND LARGEST TRADITIONAL\nPLAYERS AND MERGER SPREADS WERE THE INVESTMENT BANKPRIEARY\nTRADING DESKS. YOU HAVE MICROSOFT, LINKED IN,\nAND THAT'S BEEN OVER 10% ANNUALIZED.\n$26 BILLION DEAL. IF THAT WAS A $2 BILLION DEAL,\nTHE SPREAD WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER.\nSO, PLACES LIKE THAT ARE REALLY INTERESTING.\n>> ONE OF MY MERNLER FRIENDS ARE HAPPY TO HEAR THAT, HOPING THAT\nWILL BE THE CASE. IT'S NOT BEEN WITHOUT ITS\nPITFALLS. IN TERMS OF THE RISK, AS YOU\nWELL KNOW, DAWN, THE NUMBER OF DEALS THAT WAS NOT EXPECTED YOU\nHAVE TO PICK THE RIGHT MANAGER. DON'T YOU?\n>> IT'S A SHORT TAIL STRATEGY. YOU CAN STEP ON A LAND MINE.\nTHE KEY IS HAVING A SMART MANAGER AND HAVING A DIVERSIFIED\nPORTFOLIO. >> BEYOND DEALS, DAWN WHAT IS\nYOUR OUTLOOK ON THE CURRENT POLITICAL RISK THAT MANY PEOPLE\nHERE AGREE IS ELEVATED, ESPECIALLY HERE IN THE UNITED\nSTATES, HEADING INTO THE ELECTION?\nTHIS MARKET, WHICH IS BEING SORT OF JERKED AROUND BY VARIOUS FED\nSPEAKERS INTO A VERY IMPORTANT MEETING NEXT WEEK.\n>> IT'S BEEN REALLY INTERESTING TO ME.\nIT FEELS LIKE THE MARKETS ARE VERY CENTRAL BANK FIXATED AND\nNOT PAYING ENOUGH ATTENTION TO THE POLITICAL ANGLE THAT YOU'RE\nTALKING ABOUT WITH THE U.S. ELECTIONS, WITH REFERENDUM IN\nITALY. AND I THINK THAT'S GOING TO\nDRIVE MORE OF THE MARKET VOLATILITY GOING FORWARD.\nAND I THINK WHAT WE'VE SEEN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS IN MARKETS,\nTHERE'S A LOT OF DEBATE GOING ON IN TERMS OF THE DIMINISHING\nRETURNS FROM CENTRAL BANK POLICY AND ALSO KIND OF THE FORTITUDE\nOF THE BANKS TO STAY THE COURSE. >> THANK YOU FOR RUSHING OVER\nHERE FROM THE PANEL. APPRECIATE IT.\n>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> DAWN FITZPATRICK, HEAD OF\nGLOBAL EQUIIES AND MANAGEMENT. LOT HERE TO COME FROM DELIVERING\nALPHA. I'M OFF TO A PANEL.\nWE'LL BE TALKING TO THE EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF ALIBABA.\nRIGHT NOW OVER TO CARL AND THE GANG AT NYSE.\nCARL? >> THANK YOU.\nGOOD MORNING, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO A SPECIAL EDITION OF\n\"SQUAWK ALLEY.\" I'M CARL QUINTANILLA.\nOBVIOUSLY AN IMPORTANT DAY, BIG DAY.\nCNBC, INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR HOSTING THE SIXTH ANNUAL\nDELIVERING ALPHA CONFERENCE IN NEW YORK CITY, BRINGING HEDGE\nFUND TITANS AND INVESTORS TOGETHER, OFFERING THEIR VIEWS\nON POLICY, THE ECONOMY, POLITICS AND INVESTING.\nIN JUST A FEW MOMENTS WE'LL HEAR FROM ELLIOTT MANAGEMENT'S PAUL\nSINGER. THAT'S A BIG ONE.\nFIRST, BRIDGE WATER ASSOCIATES MAKING NEWS A MOMENT AGO,\nTALKING ABOUT RATES ALONG WITH FORMER SECRETARY TIM GEITNER.\nTAKE A LISTEN. >> WHEN JAMIE DIMON SAYS TO\nRAISE INTEREST RATES YOU THINK THAT'S WRONG?\n>> THAT'S RIGHT. I THINK THAT'S WRONG.\nAT THIS STAGE, THE RISKS ARE SO  THERE'S NO DOUBT YOU CAN SLOW\nTHE ECONOMY, WORLD ECONOMY, U.S. ECONOMY.\nLOOK AT THE INFLATION PRESSURES, IT'S A HORRIBLE THING.\nYOU LOOK AT THE DEMOGRAPHICS. ALL OF THOSE THINGS MEANS THAT\nTHE RISKS ARE SO MUCH MORE ON THE DOWNSIDE.\n>> WITH ALL OF THAT SEEMINGLY APPROPRIATE, WE DO HAVE A\nSELLOFF TODAY, DOW DOWN 212, PRETTY MUCH SESSION LOWS.\nS&P IS DOWN ALMOST 30 POINTS WITH HORRIBLE BREDTH ALL MORNING\nLONG.  YOU HAVE TO SELL OFF, RIGHT?\nIN THIS BLACKOUT WINDOW BEFORE THE FED.\nMOOD DELIVERING ALPHA HAS CHALLENGED.\nWE HAVE THESE MEDIAN INCOME NUMBERS FOR 2015.\nARE WE TOO SKEPTICAL OR TOO BULLISH ON THE OVERALL\nENVIRONMENT RIGHT NOW, JAN? >> I THINK WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN\nEDGING A LITTLE TOO BULLISH. THAT'S PROBABLY THE REASON\nMARKETS ARE STRUGGLING IN THE NEAR TERM.\nWE GOT TO A POINT WHERE 57% OF ADVISERS WERE SUGGESTING THEY\nWERE BULLISH ON THE OUTLOOK. THAT'S PEAKISH LEVELS.\nLONGER TERM THERE'S STILL A VERY HEALTHY DEGREE OF SKEPTICISM,\nRIGHT? SHORT-TERM MOVES, WE GET REALLY\nBULLISH. WE GOT UP TO NEW HIGHS IN JULY,\nBUT LONGER TERM IT'S REALLY HARD TO GET A VERY STRONG LONG BULL\nCASE IN THE FACE OF TREMENDOUSLY SLOW ECONOMIC GROWTH AND A FED\nTHAT IS INCHING TOWARD TIGHTER POLICY AND A LACK OF BELIEF THAT\nOTHER CENTRAL BANKS CAN REALLY CONTINUE TO ACCOMMODATE TO\nINFLATE MULTIPLES. >> WHEN YOU SAY IT'S HARD TO\nFIND A LONG BULL CASE, YOU MEAN LONG THE MARKET OR LONG TERM?\n>> LONG TERM. >> IF SO HOW LONG TERM?\n>> LONGER TERM. WE'RE SO MANY YEARS INTO THIS\nCYCLE, RIGHT? THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY HAS GONE\nON SINCE 2010. THE MARKET HAS BEEN RECOVERING\nSINCE 2009. YOU GET LONG IN THE TOOTH.\nINVESTORS START TO GET NERVOUS. AT THE SAME TIME, MONETARY\nPOLICY GETTING TIGHTER, INVESTORS ARE A BIT NERVOUS.\nWE'RE ULTIMATELY GOING TO FALL INTO RECESSION THE NEXT THREE TO\nFIVE YEARS. AND HOW DO YOU POSITION FOR\nTHAT? WE'VE ALREADY SEEN SUCH A\nLONG-TERM BULL MARKET. HOW DO YOU CONTINUE TO ADOPT\nTHAT LONGER-TERM TREND? THAT'S WHAT'S CREATING THIS SORT\nOF SKEPTICISM. >> COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO\nLOOK AT THAT, THOUGH. ONE THING IS TO SAY THINGS\nOVERALL ARE GOING TO GET WORSE. YOU KNOW, THE CONSUMER ISN'T\nFEELING THESE NUMBERS THAT WE SEE FROM 2015 THAT SUGGEST, YOU\nKNOW, INCOME UP 5.2%. PRETTY GOOD.\nANOTHER WAY TO LOOK AT IT, THE CONSUMER IS GOING TO FEEL IT\nSOON. THERE'S ALL THIS PESSIMISM\nAROUND THE ELECTION CYCLE. POLITICIANS ARE TRYING TO DRUM\nTHIS UP. REALLY THINGS AREN'T THAT BAD\nAND IT'S GOING TO SHOW UP LATER. WHICH WAY DO YOU LEAN?\n>> CASH STORY IS SO IMPORTANT. TOO MANY INVESTORS ARE HOLDING\nCASH AND THE FED ISN'T MAKING IT EASY ON ANYONE.\nFRIDAY THERE ARE RISKS TO WAITING TOO LONG AND THE NEXT\nTRADING DAY, THERE ARE RISKS TO GOING TOO SOON.\nTHAT'S THE SAME THING, RIGHT? THAT'S NOT MAKING IT EASY.\nFOR US, GOVERNMENT YIELDS ARE PROBABLY TOO LOW.\nCREDIT STILL LOOKS OKAY. AND FOR FOLKS THAT WERE TEASED\nINTO THE FACT THAT VALUE STOCKS MAY BE SAFE, THAT'S THE RICHEST\nPART OF THE MARKET, RIGHT? THAT'S THE MARKET WE'RE TELLING\nFOLKS TO HAVE SOME CAUTION ON. BUT FOR US, FROM AN ASSET\nALLOCATION PERSPECTIVE, THE FED IS NOT MAKING IT EASY.\nIN THE NEAR TERM THEY'RE GOING TO GO THIS YEAR.\nIN THE LONGER TERM THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GO AS MUCH.\nTHAT'S THE KEY FOR THINGS LIKE THE DOLLAR, MERGING MARKETS,\nWHICH MAKE US BULLISH NOW. >> WHEN YOU SAY THEY'RE GOING TO\nGO THIS YEAR, YOU'RE NOT BANKING ON SEPTEMBER OR ARE YOU?\n>> SOME PEOPLE WERE SAYING SAME OLD JETS OVER THE WEEKEND, SAME\nOLD FED. THE FED HAS ALWAYS WAITED A\nQUARTER WHEN THEY -- WHEN FOLKS THINK THEY WANT IT TO GO.\nLOOK AT LAST YEAR. SEPTEMBER WASN'T REALLY 50%\nPRICING. SOME PEOPLE WERE SAYING YES.\nTHEY POINTED TO DECEMBER AS GOING.\nI THINK THAT'S WHAT THEY DO. THEY GO IN DECEMBER, NOT IN\nFRONT OF THE ELECTION. BUT ULTIMATELY, THAT LEVEL OF\nFED FUND RATE, PACE IS GOING TO BE LOWER.\n>> ARE YOU ON BOARD WITH DECEMBER?\n>> WE THINK DECEMBER AS WELL. THERE'S NO JUSTIFICATION TO GO\nIN SEPTEMBER GIVEN THE WEAKENING IN DATA AND LABOR MARKET INDEX\nIS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT THING.\n>> THAT WON'T STOP PEOPLE FROM TALKING ABOUT IT.\n>> ABSOLUTELY. >> IF JANET YELLIN WERE A REAL\nLEADER SHE WOULD CUT OFF THE MIKES RIGHT NOW.\nSHOULD SHE BE STIFLING THIS COMMENTARY?\n>> LIKE GREENSPAN BEFORE HER. HE NEVER ALLOWED THIS TO HAPPEN.\nIT'S CONFUSING FOR THE MARKETS. NEXT TRADING DAY YOU HAD\nSOMEBODY OFFSET WHAT WAS SAID BEFORE.\nWAY TOO MUCH INFORMATION. FED GOT THEMSELVES INTO THIS BY\nPUBLISHING ALL THIS TRANSPARENCY, DOTS, INFLATION\nFORECASTS. I THINK THAT'S PUT THEM IN A\nTOUGH SITUATION. >> WE ASKED FOR TRANSPARENCY.\nWE GOT T I CAN TELL YOU THAT. >> UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.\n>> FOR BETTER OR WORSE. GINA, PHIL, THANK YOU FOR THAT.\nGOOD TO SEE YOU. >>> WE CONTINUE TO WATCH THE\nMARKETS. DOW IS DOWN 211.\nWE ARE GETTING BREAKING NEWS.",

SINGER AND KELLY.\n>> HOW SERIOUS IS THE SITUATION TODAY?\n>> I THINK WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF CLOSE TO A 40-YEAR EXPERIMENT\nIN HOW LEVERAGED CAN A SYSTEM BE AND IN HOW MANY WAYS.\nTHE GLOBAL DERIVITIVES MARKET IS SOMETHING LIKE $700 TRILLION.\nOF COURSE, THAT DOESN'T EXACTLY REPRESENT A PROXY FOR RISK.\nBETWEEN THE FACT THAT 75% OF THAT IS INTEREST RATE\nDERIVITIVES AND THAT IN 5,000-ISH YEARS OF HISTORY THERE\nHAVE NEVER BEEN INTEREST RATES REMOTELY CLOSE TO WHERE WE ARE\nNOW CAUSES ME TO THINK THAT THIS LONG DOWN TREND IN INTEREST\nRATES, WHICH NOW HAVE SOMETHING LIKE 30% FIXED INCOME TRADING AT\nZERO OR WEIRDLY BELOW DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT HASN'T WORKED.\nTHEY SAY IT HAS WORKED AND WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT IT, MEANING\nCENTRAL BANKERS AND THOSE WHO APOLOGIZE AND THOSE WHO SUPPORT\nAND CHEER ON CENTRAL BANKERS, THEY SAY, WELL, GROWTH HASN'T\nREALLY PICKED UP. BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF WHAT WE'RE\nDOING, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT WORSE.\nI DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S POSSIBLY RIGHT AS FAR AS IT\nGOES. WHAT I MEAN BY FISCAL, I'LL\nEXPLAIN. FISCAL POLICIES THAT WOULD\nRESTORE LEVELS OF GROWTH SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THOSE\nDESCRIBED BY RAY DALIO AND TIM GEITNER, RESTORE THAT TO THE\nDEVELOPED WORLD IN THE ABSENCE OF FISCAL POLICIES IN TAX\nREGULATION, TRADE, EDUCATION POLICIES THAT WOULD DEAL WITH\nTHE CONSEQUENCES OF TECHNOLOGICAL -- IN THE ABSENCE\nOF THOSE POLICIES, SURE. MONETARY POLICY IS THE ONLY GAME\nIN TOWN. BUT EIGHT YEARS OF EFFORT\nEVER-DECLINING RATES AND EVER-INCREASING RADICALISM IN\nOTHER MONETARY POLICIES HAVE NOT CREATED A SUSTAINABLE,\nACCELERATING UPTICK IN GROWTH. WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IS CREATED A\nTREMENDOUS INCREASE IN HIDDEN RISK, RISK THAT INVESTORS DON'T\nEXACTLY KNOW OR HAVE FACED ABOUT THEIR HOLDINGS.\nAND I THINK IT'S A VERY DANGEROUS TIME IN THE GLOBAL\nECONOMY AND GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS.\n>> AND BY WAY OF REMINDING PEOPLE AS WELL OF 2007, WHEN I\nREAD IN JULIAN TUTT'S ACCOUNT, YOU SAT WITH THE G7, CORRECT,\nAND TOLD THEM OF YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE MARKET AT THAT POINT\nAND SAID WE LOOK AT A LOT OF THESE EXOTIC MORTGAGE\nINSTRUMENTS AND LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENING AND THINK THE BANKS\nARE ULTIMATELY GOING TO HAVE HUGE PROBLEMS AND THEY'RE\nOVERLEVERAGED AND WE WANT TO WARN YOU ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN.\nGEITNER AND OTHERS WERE IN THE ROOM, AS I UNDERSTAND, AND SORT\nOF SAID OKAY. SO, EVEN FOR PEOPLE TODAY, WHO\nMIGHT HAVE HEARD YOUR WARNINGS BEFORE, WOULD YOU SAY NOW WE'RE\nAT A POINT LIKE IN '07 WHEN THAT INDEX WAS CRACKING, WHEN YOU SEE\nBOND MARKETS CRACKING? IS NOW THAT POINT?\nIS THAT ENOUGH TO WARN PEOPLE TODAY LIKE YOU WOULD HAVE WANTED\nTO WARN THEM BACK IN 2007? >> A COMMENT OR TWO ABOUT THAT\nTIME AND THAT EPISODE. IT WASN'T JUST MYSELF AND JIMMY\nCHANOS. I PERMANENTLY WENT TO GERMANY\nBECAUSE WE HAD SEVERAL RELATIONSHIPS IN THE FINANCE, IT\nWAS PRACTITIONORS THAT HAD A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE\nTHE FINANCIAL SYSTEM WAS IN TERMS OF RISKS.\nTHE SECOND THING THAT STRUCK ME ABOUT THAT IS THE AMAZING\nARROGANCE OF THE POLICY MAKERS. THEY DIDN'T LISTEN.\nTHEY TREATED US AS IF WE WERE IGNORANT CHILDREN AND, OF\nCOURSE, THEY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. NEITHER DID THE GERMAN POLICY\nMAKERS, PARENTHETICALLY. BUT AFTER THE CRASH, IT'S ALL\nBEEN ONE WAY. THE EMERGENCY ACTION FOLLOWING\nTHE CRASH DESPITE THE FACT THAT CENTRAL BANKERS, INCLUDING, OF\nCOURSE, THE FED, HAD NO IDEA OF THE RISKS THAT WERE BUILDING,\nHAD NO IDEA OF THE VULNERABILITY OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO\nTHE CONFLUENCE OF THESE RISKS, THE STRUCTURED PRODUCTS, REAL\nESTATE BOOM ALL IN SORT OF A SELF REINFORCING DANCE, THEY HAD\nNO IDEA ABOUT THAT AND SO, TO ME, THE CREDIBILITY OF THE FED\nAND THE TREASURY, BUT THE FED GOING FORWARD WAS SEVERELY\nCHALLENGED. BUT THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF\nTHE CRASH POLICY WAS APPROPRIATE, REDUCE INTEREST\nRATES SHARPLY. STAND READY TO SUPPLY LIQUIDITY\nIN THE MIDST OF A CRASH. WELL, THE CRASH PERIOD, YOU\nKNOW, OCCURRED OVER A PERIOD OF ITS MOST INTENSE PHASE, IN A\nPERIOD OF WEEKS OR MONTHS. BY THE MIDDLE OF 2009, IT WAS\nTIME FOR A PIVOT. AND NO COUNTRY IN THE DEVELOPED\nWORLD -- AND I'M TALKING ABOUT JAPAN, EUROPE, THE UK, THE\nUNITED STATES. NO COUNTRY ACTUALLY MADE THE\nPIVOT TO THE OTHER POLICIES THAT COULD MAKE THE ECONOMY -- THAT\nCOULD RESTORE GROWTH, THAT COULD CURE THE STRUCTURAL IMPEDIMENTS\nTO GROWTH AND BRING GROWTH BACK TO SOMETHING CLOSE TO THE\nPREVIOUSLY EXPERIENCED LEVELS OF GROWTH.\nI BELIEVE THAT -- I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT IT'S JUST NOT THE\nCASE THAT THE DEVELOPED WORLD -- LET'S TALK ABOUT THE UNITED\nSTATES -- IS LIMITED TO AN ASSUMPTION OF 1 1/2 OR 2% PER\nYEAR REAL GROWTH GOING FORWARD. AND I CERTAINLY DON'T BELIEVE\nTHAT IF IT IS LIMITED IT'S BECAUSE OF DEMOGRAPHICS.\n>> SO YOU THINK IT COULD GROW AT 4% TO 5%?\n>> NO, BUT SOMETHING MORE THAN THIS 2% THAT AMERICA IS STUCK\nIN. >> ARE WE POSSIBLY AT THAT PIVOT\nPOINT IN THE U.S. NOW, FISCALLY SPEAKING?\nSHOULD DONALD TRUMP BE ELECTED PRESIDENT?\n>> WELL, I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT POLITICS AT THIS JUNCTURE.\nIN TWO MONTHS OR SO, WE'LL KNOW THE ANSWER TO THE -- WHICH\nENVELOPE OR IF BOTH OF THESE PEOPLE ARE STILL ON THE STAGE AT\nTHAT TIME. BUT WHAT I DO BELIEVE IS THAT\nPRO GROWTH POLICIES ARE POLICIES THAT COULD AND WOULD INCREASE\nGROWTH. FOR EXAMPLE, I BELIEVE IT WOULD\nHAVE BEEN VASTLY DIFFERENT FOR THE GROWTH RATE OF THE AMERICAN\nECONOMY AND THE PROBLEM OF UNDEREMPLOYMENT AND UNEMPLOYMENT\nAND THE REDUCTION IN THE LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION RATE, WHICH\nIS EVERY BIT AS IMPORTANT, PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE\nHEADLINE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, HAD MITT ROMNEY BEEN ELECTED\nPRESIDENT. THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A NUMBER\nOF POLICIES IN TAX REGULATION AND THINGS THAT I TALKED ABOUT A\nCOUPLE OF MINUTES AGO, THAT WOULD HAVE GENERATED A HIGHER\nRATE OF GROWTH AS DISTINGUISHED FROM THE CONTINUATION --\n>> FASCINAING DISCUSSION WITH ELLIOTT SINGER, TALKING ABOUT\nTHE CREDIBILITY OF THE FED, VARIOUS POLICIES THAT HE\nBELIEVED MIGHT HAVE TAKEN US -- AND MIGHT STILL TAKE THE ECONOMY\nTO A HIGHER GROWTH RATE THAN IT CURRENTLY HAS.\nARGUING ALSO THAT THE ARGUMENT FROM POLICY MAKERS THAT THINGS\nWOULD HAVE BEEN WORSE HAD THEY NOT ACTED AS THEY HAD, IN HIS\nWORDS PERHAPS IS NOT EXACTLY RIGHT.\nDOW CONTINUES IN THE SELLOFF DOWN 234.\nWHEN WE COME BACK, A LOT MORE FROM DELIVERING ALPHA, INCLUDING\nBEST IDEAS PANEL FROM SOME OF THE TOP NAMES IN INVESTING.\nMORE ON APPLE, SOME PREORDER NUMBERS ARE OUT.\nSECRETARY LEW MAKING HEADLINES ON EU TAXES AND MORE.\nDON'T GO AWAY.",

TRUMP IS SAYING WHAT A LOT OF\nPEOPLE BELIEVE. IT'S RIGGED.\nTHEY'RE ALL IN ON IT IN WASHINGTON.\nTHE RATES ARE LOW. THE UNEMPLOYMENT IS REALLY 40%,\nNOT 4%. THEY'RE TRYING TO GET OVER ON\nUS, AND HE'S A TRUTH TELLER. WHAT DO YOU SAY?\n>> WRONG. I WOULD SAY THAT THE FED IS ONE\nOF THE LEAST POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS IN WASHINGTON RIGHT\nNOW. YOU KNOW, FED GOVERNORS HAVE\nLONG TERMS. THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS SET UP TO\nMAKE IT LESS POLITICAL. THE ONLY REASON THAT SOME PEOPLE\nSAY THAT THE FED HAS KEPT RATES LOW, THAT'S A POLITICAL MOVE, IS\nTHAT THEY'RE THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO\nANYTHING OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS TO GOOSE THE ECONOMY\nBECAUSE OF CONGRESSIONAL GRIDLOCK.\nIF REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS HAD BEEN ABLE TO AGREE AND WE'D GOT\nAN BIGGER FISCAL STIMULUS PLAN THROUGH, RATES PROBABLY WOULDN'T\nBE SO LOW AT THIS POINT. BUT THE FED IS WATCHING THE\nECONOMY. THEY'RE NOT SEEING A LOT OF\nINFLATION. THEY'RE SEEING KIND OF SIDEWAYS\nGROWTH. IT'S STILL ABOUT 2%.\nTHERE'S A LOT OF REASONS TO KEEP RATES LOW STILL.\n>> AND THEY DID JUST RAISE RATES.\nTHERE'S SPECULATION ABOUT WHAT THEY'LL DO GOING FORWARD.\nALL RIGHT. MAYBE YOU GET THAT POINT.\nBUT HOW ABOUT THIS, THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE.\nIT'S NOT 4%. HOW ABOUT ALL THE NUMBER WHO\nHAVE LEFT THE WORK FORCE? HOW ABOUT THE PEOPLE IF LOUSY\nJOBS. THAT RATE IS ACTUALLY 40%, TRUMP\nSAYS HE'S HEARD. >> HE'S HEARD PEOPLE SAY IT'S\n40%. IT'S NOT 40%.\nHE'S ALSO SAID IT'S DEPRESSION ERA UNEMPLOYMENT.\nIT'S NOT. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS 4.9%.\nTHE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE MEASURES PEOPLE WHO HAVE A JOB OR ARE\nLOOKING FOR A JOB. WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT ARE ALL\nTHE PEOPLE WHO AREN'T LOOKING. THERE ARE A LOT OF REASONS,\nCHRIS, WHY PEOPLE AREN'T LOOKING.\n10,000 BABY BOOMERS A DAY HIT 65 YEARS OLD.\nSOME OF THEM ARE NOT LOOKING BECAUSE THEY'RE RETIRED.\nMY GRANDMA IS NOT LOOKING FOR A JOB BECAUSE HE'S 88.\nSOME PEOPLE ARE HOME TAKING CARE OF THEIR KIDS BECAUSE CHILDCARE\nCOSTS AS MUCH AS COLLEGE. SO THERE ARE A LOT OF POLICY\nDRIVEN THINGS WE CAN DO TO ADDRESS THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN\nLEFT BEHIND BY THE LABOR MARKET, BUT PRESIDENT UNEMPLOYMENT RATE\nIS NOT 40%. >> SO WHY DO YOU ECONOMIST TYPES\nGET IN HIGH DUJEN OVER THIS? THIS ISN'T JUST POLITICAL TALK.\nTHIS IS WHAT HE DOES ON A RANGE OF ISSUES.\nWHY DOES IT MATTER MORE WHEN HE DOES IT ABOUT THE ECONOMY?\n>> WELL, INTEREST RATES MATTER HUGELY.\nTHIS IS WHAT YOU PAY ON YOUR HOUSE, ON YOUR CAR.\nALSO, CONFIDENCE IN THE ECONOMY. WHEN HE COMES IN AND SAYS THE\nFED IS POLITICAL, THE FED IS MANIPULATING, THAT'S A\nCONFIDENCE ISSUE. THAT CAN REALLY SHAKE INVESTORS.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL THAT THERE'S A BUBBLE IN THE STOCK\nMARKET RIGHT NOW. THAT'S WORTH SAYING.\nLOW RATES HAVE DEFINITELY HELPED PUSH STOCKS UP.\nTHERE'S A DIVIDE BETWEEN WHAT PEOPLE ARE FEELING AND THE REAL\nECONOMY ON MAIN STREET AND STOCKS.\nTHAT'S A CONVERSATION THAT WE HAVE BEEN HAVING FOR SEVERAL\nYEARS NOW. THAT'S NOT ABOUT THE FED BEING\nPOLITICAL. >> NOW, MARK CUBAN, WE ALL KNOW\nWHO HE IS. HE TWEETED ABOUT THIS.\nHE SEES IT AS A BIG DEAL. TRUMP'S COMMENT ON THE FED IS\nEXACTLY WHY THE MARKET WILL TANK IF HE IS ELECTED.\nASK HIM IF HE UNDERSTANDS HOW THE FED WORKS.\nALL RIGHT. LET'S PUT THE SECOND PART ASIDE,\nHOW THE FED WORKS. THE FIRST PART, IS CUBAN GUILTY\nOF POLITICAL HYPERBOLE? IS THERE ANY REASON TO BELIEVE\nMARKETS WOULD TANK IF TRUMP CAME IN?\n>> WHEN YOU TALK TO PEOPLE IN THE MARKETS, IF DONALD TRUMP\nWERE ELECTED PRESIDENT, MARKET PARTICIPANTS THINK IF HE DID THE\nTHINGS HE SAYS HE WANTS TO DO, BUILD A WALL, HAVE A TRADE WAR\nWITH CHINA, THAT WOULD UNDERMINE CONFIDENCE IN AMERICAN\nCOMPANIES, UNDERMINE CONFIDENCE IN THE ECONOMY, AND HURT THE\nSTOCK MARKET. THAT IS THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM\nTHERE. THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP, THERE IS THIS CONVENTION, AND DONALD TRUMP\nDEFIES ALL CONVENTIONS. YOU DON'T TALK UP OR DOWN THE\nECONOMY, AND YOU DON'T ATTACK THE FED.\nTHE FED IS MANIPULATING INTEREST RATES.\nTHAT ITS JOB. IT'S BEEN DOING THAT IN THE\nABSENCE OF ANY KIND OF CONCRETE POLICY IN WASHINGTON TO GROW THE\nAMERICAN ECONOMY OVER THE PAST EIGHT YEARS.\n>> IT'S INTERESTING. RECENTLY IN MEETINGS, JANET\nYELLEN AND OTHER FED GOVERNORS HAVE BEEN KIND OF IN VEILED\nLANGUAGE SAYING, YOU KNOW WHAT, WASHINGTON, WE NEED SOME FISCAL\nSTIMULUS. WE NEED YOU TO DO SOME OF THE\nHEAVY LIFTING. WE HAVE BEEN DOING IT FOR SO\nLONG. >> SO HE SAID THEY'RE TRYING TO\nHELP THE DEMOCRATS. THAT'S THE LAST OF HIS\nALLEGATIONS. THEY'RE DOING EXACTLY WHAT YOU\nSAY, THAT CONGRESS ISN'T GIVING OBAMA WHAT HE WANTS, SO THEY\nWILL. JUICE THE SYSTEM TO MAKE IT LOOK\nGOOD WHEN IT ISN'T. >> THERE'S A VERY VIGOROUS\nDEBATE GOING ON IN THE FED RIGHT NOW.\nIT'S ABOUT HALF AND HALF ON WHETHER TO RAISE RATES OR NOT.\nIT'S NOT AS THOUGH EVERYBODY IN THE FED IS SAYING WE GOT TO KEEP\nRATES LOW TO HELP THE DEMOCRATS.

SO INVESTORS CAN DO THEIR OWN\nMATH. WHETHER YOU'RE CONSOLIDATED OR\nNOT CONSOLIDATED. YOU TALK ABOUT CASH FLOW, WE\nOVER THE LAST 12 MONTHS BOUGHT BACK $5 BILLION OF STOCK, OUR\nOWN STOCK, AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S CASH THAT WE -- REAL CASH WE\nRETURN TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS.

WE'RE IN A MARKET IN THE\nCONFLUENCE OF HIGH GROWTH OF THE CHINESE ECONOMY, AS WELL AS, YOU\nKNOW, TECHNOLOGY. AND THAT'S VERY, VERY EXCITING\nFOR US. SO IN CHINA TODAY, WHAT YOU'RE\nSEEING IS CONSUMERS ARE SHIFTING THEIR PURCHASES ONLINE, BUT\nTHERE IS GOING TO BE MORE GROWTH IN CONSUMPTION BECAUSE CHINA HAS\nA RELATIVELY LOW PERCENTAGE OF GDP THAT IS LEVERAGED TO\nCONSUMPTIONS, ABOUT 40%. THE MORE DEVELOPED THE ECONOMIES\nARE 60%, 70%, AND IF YOU LOOK AT AVERAGE CHINESE CONSUMER,\nTHEY'RE IN NET CASH POSITION. THERE IS NET NET 4.6 TRILLION\nU.S. DOLLARS OF NET CASH SAVINGS ON THE BALANCE SHEET OF CHINESE\nHOUSEHOLDS. TO GIVE YOU A CONTEXT TO THAT\nNUMBER, THE AVERAGE AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD AN AGGREGATE HAS $11\nTRILLION OF MORTGAGE DEBT.

JUST TO PUT THAT NUMBER IN\nCONTEXT, I THINK AMAZON IN THE UNITED STATES HANDLES SOMEWHERE\nAROUND 5 MILLION TO 6 MILLION PACKAGES, OKAY.\nAND SOY LOOK AT TWO MILLION PEOPLE IN OUR ESKOU SYSTEM THAT\nARE MANAGING THE WAREHOUSES AND ALSO DELIVERING PACKAGES ON THE\nSTREETS, IF YOU COMBINE THE ENTIRE WORKFORCE OF FEDEX AND\nU.P.S., THAT'S 600,000 PEOPLE.

HE WILL JOIN OUR SHOW LIVE FOR\nMORE IDEAS AND WILL BRING YOU HIGHLIGHTS OF INTERVIEWS WITH\nOTHERS. LIVE FROM DELIVERING ALPHA IN\nNEW YORK CITY. LET'S START WITH THE PRICE OF\nOIL REVERSING GAINS. JACKIE DEANGELES HAS DETAILS.\n>> GOOD AFTERNOON. 3% SELL OFF TODAY AND CLOSING AT\n$44.90. THREE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS\nIMPACTING OIL PRICES. THE FIRST WOULD BE THE MONTHLY\nREPORT TAKING DEMAND FORECASTS DOWN NOT JUST FOR THIS YEAR BUT\nNEXT YEAR, AS WELL. THE WALL STREET THESIS FOR THIS\nREBOUND THAT IS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN DEPENDS ON DEMAND STAYING\nAT LEAST FLAT OR TICKING UP. SO THAT'S NOT REALLY A GOOD\nSIGN. THE EQUITY PLUNGED TODAY AND\nALSO A LITTLE BIT OF STRENGTH IN THE DOLLAR NOT GOOD SIGNS FOR\nCRUDE OIL. INVENTORIES TOMORROW.\nREMEMBER LAST WEEK WE SAW A DRAW DOWN OF 14 MILLION BARRELS.\nSOME ARE LOOKING FOR A PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL BUILD.\nTHOSE ARE THE ONES WHO THINK LAST WEEK'S ACTION WAS A ONE OFF\nEVENT. THE BUILD FACTOR BEING PRICED\nINTO OIL PRICES TODAY. AS YOU CAN SEE THE EFFECT THAT\nIT HA. ONE REASON THAT WILL HOLD THE\nALGERIA MEETING. IT'S THE WILDCARD.\nBACK TO YOU. >> THANK YOU.\nKEEPING AN EYE ON THOSE CRUDE PRICES BELOW $45 A BARREL.\nTRACKING HIS BROADER SELL OFF AGAIN HERE.\n>> THIS IS ALL ABOUT WORRIES ABOUT THE FED POSSIBLY RAISING\nRATES. WE HAVE A RISK OFF DAY.\nWE HAVE A DOUBLE WHAMMY HITTING OIL STOCKS.\nWE HAVE GENERAL RISK OFF DAY. EXXON GETTING HIT.\nIT HAS BEEN A STALWART RECENTLY BUT BREAKING DOWN.\nIT IS AT THE LOWEST LEVEL SINCE APRIL.\n$85 YOU SEE RIGHT THERE. YOU WANT TO SEE A RISK OFF DAY?\nYOU HEARD THE TEN YEAR YIELD DROPPED OFF.\nNORMALLY THIS WOULD BE A BIG HELP TO BANK STOCKS.\nTHEY WOULD MOVE UP ON THAT. HOW MUCH IS THIS DEBATE WITH THE\nFED FREAKING OUT? IT HAS GONE 11 TO 18.\nLOOK AT THAT AT 18. HERE ARE THE SPEECHES FOR\nOCTOBER AND NOVEMBER. IT'S WHERE THE CASH IS RIGHT\nNOW. THAT'S A HUGE INCREASE IN THE\nVIX. WE HAVE FLATTENING IN THE VIX.\nWE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT IN A VERY LONG TIME.\nBACK TO YOU. >> BOB, THANK YOU.\nLET'S GET TO THE KEY POINT IN THE LAST COUPLE OF SESSIONS\nGOING BACK TO FRIDAY STOCKS AND BONDS BOTH SELLING OFF.\nI SAT DOWN WITH PAUL SINGER EARLIER TODAY AT DELIVERING\nALPHA AND SPOKE ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY FOR SELL OFF IN\nTANDEM TO CONTINUE. >> IT'S BEEN SO LONG IN THE\nMAKING THAT THE BOND PRICES ARE SO HIGH, INTEREST RATES ARE SO\nLOW THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO ASCERTAIN WHAT CHANGE IN\nTHINKING WILL GENERATE A GROUP THINK WITH A DIFFERENT VECTOR,\nTHINKING THAT BONDS ARE NOT THE SAFE HAVEN THAT BOTH STOCKS AND\nBONDS CAN GO DOWN. I THINK GO DOWN TOGETHER.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT AND WHAT HE SAID IN OUR \"CLOSING\nBELL\" EXCHANGE. MICHAEL FAR JOINS US FROM D.C.\nKEITH IS HERE AT POST NINE AND JACK BERUZIAN.\nTYPICALLY STOCKS GO DOWN AND THAT MEANS BONDS GO UP BECAUSE\nIT IS TAKING MONEY OUT OF ONE ASSET CLASS AND PUTTING IT IN\nANOTHER. >> PRETTY SIGNIFICANT ON THE\nSHORT TERM MOVE BASIS. ON THE LONGER TERM WE HAVE TO\nGET BACK TO A VERSION ON RELATIONSHIPS WE HAVE COME TO\nUNDERSTAND OVER THE LAST FIVE, TEN YEARS.\nTHEY HAVE DEFINITELY GOTTEN OUT OF WHACK.\nMR. SINGER IS RIGHT ON THAT. ON A SHORT TERM BASIS YOU ARE\nSEEING BOTH GO DOWN BECAUSE MARKETS ARE SO TEMPERAMENTAL.\nPART OF THAT IS WHAT MR. SINGER IS SAYING IS THAT ANY LITTLE\nMATCH OR FUSE WILL SET THEM OFF IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.\nYOU TAKE A LOOK AT OIL PRICES GOING DOWN, EQUITIES GOING DOWN,\nBONDS GOING DOWN. THAT IS A CLASSIC CONCERN STORY\nAND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE SEEING. THE MOVEMENTS HAVE BEEN SO\nDRAMATIC. ON FRIDAY WE HAD MARKETS.\nTHE VIX OVERBOUGHT. TODAY WE HAD THEM GETTING BACK\nTO NEUTRAL. TODAY THEY ARE VASTLY OVERSOLD.\nI THINK SHORT TERM THIS IS A VERY GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO START\nNIBBLING AROUND THE EDGES. >> WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THIS\nENVIRONMENT? >> HOLDING MY BREATH AND SEEING\nWHICH WAY THIS IS GOING TO SHAKE OUT.\nWE STARTED LAST WEEK AND THE MARKET DECLINED ON THE FED NEWS.\nI NEVER BELIEVED IT. I WROTE THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO\nHAVE A RATE HIKE BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR.\nI CONTINUE TO HOLD THAT POSITION.\nI THINK THAT THE UNCERTAINTY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEK IS\nPROBABLY MORE POLITICAL. I THINK THAT THE EXPECTATIONS\nFOR A CLINTON PRESIDENCY MIGHT HAVE BEEN UPSET SOME OVER THE\nWEEKEND AND I THINK THAT YOU ARE SEEING SOME TRADERS BEGIN TO\nVOTE WITH THEIR FEET. PARTICULARLY WITH MR. TRUMP'S\nCRITICISM OF FED CHAIRMAN YELLEN.\nWALL STREET HAS A LOT TO DIGEST COMING INTO THE BEGINNING OF\nTHIS WEEK. >> THERE WAS A BIT OF A DEBATE\nON FRIDAY ABOUT THE SELLOFF THAT DAY WHETHER IT WAS ABOUT THE FED\nOR ABOUT NORTH KOREA. NOW WE THINK MAYBE THE ELECTION.\nWE'RE AT 173 ON THE TEN YEAR. WHAT IS THAT ALL ABOUT?\n>> COMBINATION OF ALL OF THE ABOVE.\nONE OF THE SOUND BYTES IS WHEN SINGER SAID NOTHING IS WORKING\nWHEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT CENTRAL BANKS.\nI THINK THAT WAS SO INSIGHTFUL. RIGHT NOW THAT SEEMS TO BE ONE\nOF THESE OPINIONS THAT IS CREEPING INTO THE MENTALITY OF\nTHE INVESTING PUBLIC. OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST\nCOUPLE OF MONTHS WE HAVE GONE THROUGH THE LOW VOLATILE\nENVIRONMENT. WE SAW PEOPLE CHASING RETURNS,\nCHASING YIELD AND STARTED GETTING INTO STOCKS, TREATING\nTHEM LIKE BONDS. NOW THEY ARE GETTING THE\nVOLATILITY BACK AND WHEN MICHAEL FAR SAID IS RIGHT.\nTHEY START TO SMELL THE ELECTION AND ALL OF THOSE UNCERTAINTIES.\nBEFORE YOU KNOW IT WE HAVE A BIG MOVE IN THE MARKETS.\nI THINK FRIDAY WAS THE BEGINNING OF SOMETHING.\nFRIDAY MIGHT BE THE START OF WHAT IN HIND SIGHT WE WILL LOOK\nAT AS THE BEGINNING OF A MOVE DOWN.\nIT STARTED AROUND THIS LEVEL LAST YEAR.\nWE MADE A HIGH OF 2135. WE ARE RIGHT THERE AGAIN NOW.\nLET'S SEE IF I'M RIGHT Y. HAVE A FEELING.\nI HAVE A FEELING THESE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS CAN BE VERY\nDANGEROUS. >> PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TELLING US\nFOR SOME TIME IF INTEREST RATES MOVE HIGHER IT COULD HELP THE\nSTOCK MARKET. IF THE TEN YEAR MOVES UP TO 2%\nDO YOU EXPECT STOCKS WOULD FIND THEIR FOOTING OR IS THIS THE\nKIND OF ENVIRONMENT WE HAVE BEEN LAYING OUT WHERE UNFORTUNATELY\nTHEY WOULD BE SELLING OFF IN THAT ENVIRONMENT?\n>> ONLY IF MOVE TO 2% IS BASED ON ECONOMIC FUNDAMENTALS.\nONE THOUGHT I DIDN'T COMPLETE WAS ONE REASON THAT YOU ARE\nSEEING THE MARKET GO DOWN WHILE THE TEN YEAR YIELD IS GOING UP\nIS THAT IT IS A GLOBAL GROWTH CONCERN STORY BUT ALSO A CONCERN\nTHAT CENTRAL BANKS ARE TAPPED OUT AND JUST CAN'T DO MORE.\nTHAT IS WHAT JACK WAS ALLUDING TO.\nTHAT IS WHERE YOU ARE GETTING THE STORM HAPPENING TODAY.\nI WILL GO BACK AND SAY FOR THE LONGER TERM I THINK WE WILL SEE\nWEAKNESS IN THIS. SEPTEMBER IS ALWAYS A VOLATILE\nMONTH. ON THE SHORTER TERM I THINK\nTHERE ARE EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITIES TO STEP IN HERE.\nNEXT WEEK WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT RAISING RATES AND GOING TO\nGIVE US DOVISH LANGUAGE THEN YOU SEE THE MARKET RALLY AGAIN.\n>> WE HAVE A LOT TO GET TO. THANK YOU ALL.\nGOOD TO SEE YOU. >> FROM THE MACRO TO MICROSAYS\nHE IS SHORTING ALIBABA. TAKE A LISTEN.\n>> PEOPLE HAVE COMPARED AMAZON TO ALIBABA AND IT COULDN'T BE\nFURTHER FROM THE TRUTH. AMAZON IS A FREE CASH FLOW\nMACHINE BEGINNING IN 2002 AND HAS BEEN.\nTHIS IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF IT.\nIT IS JUST BURNING CASH IN A DRAMATIC RATE.\n>> ALIBABA IS LOWER TODAY. DAVID FAVOR JUST FINISHED A\nDELIVERING ALPHA DISCUSSION WITH ALIBABA EXECUTIVE VICE CHAIRMAN\nWHO HAS WORDS I CAN IMAGINE. >> WELL, IT'S AN INTERESTING\nOPPORTUNITY TO HEAR SORT OF BOTH SIDES.\nTHE EXECUTIVE VICE CHAIRMAN OF ALIBABA RIGHT THERE AT THE\nFOUNDING OF THE COMPANY BACK IN 1999 AND DISPUTES A LOT OF WHAT\nHE WOULD SAY AND POINTS OUT THAT DESPITE THAT DROP TODAY OF 1%\nTHE STOCK HAS BEEN A VERY STRONG PERFORMER OVER THE COURSE OF\nTHIS YEAR, HELPED IN PART BY THE NUMBERS A FEW WEEKS BACK WHERE\nIT DELIVERED TOP LINE GROWTH. SPECIFIC TO THE QUESTIONS AND\nCRITICISM THIS IS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY.\n>> THE PROBLEM IS HE DOESN'T SEEM TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE\nBUSINESS AND TRY TO APPRECIATE THE POWER OF THE DIGITAL ECONOMY\nIN CHINA. AND YOU CAN LAY A LOT OF CLAIMS\nAND ACCUSATIONS ON OUR BUSINESS. ON THE LOGISTICS BUSINESS WE\nMADE FULL DISCLOSURE ON THE PROFITS, LOSS, REVENUES, ASSETS,\nLIABILITIES OF THE BUSINESS. INVESTORS CAN DO THEIR OWN MATH.\nWHETHER YOU CONSOLIDATED OR NOT. >> SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT\nTHE 48 OR SO PERCENT OF THE DELIVERY BUSINESS THAT ALIBABA\nOWNS. IT DOESN'T CONTROL.\nMR. TSAI WENT ON EXPLAINING THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE CONTROL OF A\nCOMPANY THAT HAS AROUND 2 MILLION EMPLOYEES AS DOES THE\nDELIVERY OF WHAT IS 40 MILLION PACKAGES A DAY IN CHINA BY, OF\nCOURSE, WHAT IS THE LARGEST ONLINE COMMERCE PLATFORM IN THE\nWORLD. >> IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT JIM\nCHANOS. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SHORT\nALIBABA FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS ABOUT ACCOUNTING AND STRUCTURE\nAND HOW YOU CAN TRADE SHARES AND HAVE OWNERSHIP.\nI THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING THE WAY TSAI WAS SAYING\nFUNDAMENTALLY OUR TOP LINE JUST KEEPS GROWING.\n>> AND IT DOES. THERE IS NO REAL QUESTIONING\nTHAT ALTHOUGH THEY ARE ACTUALLY ELIMINATING ANY SORT OF REAL\nFOCUS ON MERCHANDISE VALUE. TO YOUR POINT THE TOP LINE LAST\nQUARTER ACCELERATED AND THAT IS THE OVERALL THEME THAT YOU GET\nFROM ALIBABA EXECUTIVES LIKE MR. TSAI IS WE ARE PLAYING TO THE\nGROWTH OF THE CHINESE CONSUMER AS THE ECONOMY CHANGES THAT WILL\nONLY CONTINUE AND WE HAVE THE WIND AT OUR BACKS.\nTHERE ARE NO SHORTAGES OF POTENTIAL CRITICS IN TERMS OF\nACTUAL NUMBERS AND SOME FREE CASH FLOW NUMBERS.\n>> THE BIGGEST IPO IN HISTORY. >> AND JUST IN THE LAST YEAR UP\n54%. MUCH TO THE CHAGRIN OF JIM\nCHANOS. >> WE HAVE 48 MINUTES.\nTHIS IS AN INTERESTING LAST HOUR OF TRADE.\nTHE DOW DOWN ALMOST 300",

I THINK FIRST WHAT YOU HAVE TO\nDO IS WHAT SECRETARY LEW SUGGESTED, UNDERSCORE THE\nIMPORTANCE OF THE CONSUMER PROTECTION BUREAU IN PROTECTING\nCONSUMERS. WITHOUT THEIR EFFORTS, WITHOUT\nTHE EFFORTS OF LOCAL CALIFORNIA AUTHORITIES, THOUSANDS OF\nCUSTOMERS WOULD HAVE BEEN DUPED. THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN STEPS, BUT\nWE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THEIR ACCOUNTABILITY IS NOT\nTRANSITORY, THAT IN FACT THEY TRULY RECOGNIZE WHAT THEY DID\nAND THAT THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE FURTHER STEPS AND ALSO THERE IS\nAN ISSUE OF HOW FAR THE ACCOUNTABILITY GOES UP AND WILL\nIT BE SUSTAINED OR IS THIS JUST A WAY TO STOP A BAD STORY AND\nMOVE ON. >> YOU WANT THEM TO SAY THEY'RE\nSORRY? >> NO, I WANT THEM TO SAY,\nFRANKLY, WHAT THEY DID, EXPLAIN IT TO THEM, HOW THEY FOUND OUT,\nHOW THEY WEREN'T AWARE OF IT BEFORE, WHICH BROUGHT THEIR\nATTENTION, WHAT ABOUT THEIR INCENTIVE STRUCTURE, DID THIS\nCONTRIBUTE TO THIS BEHAVIOR, IS THAT STRUCTURE BEEN CHANGED.\nWHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO IN FUTURE TO PREVENT THIS AND THERE\nIS A WHOLE SERIES OF STEPS AND NOT JUST ABOUT WELLS FARGO,\nABOUT THE INDUSTRY IN GENERAL. I THINK ONE OF THE CRITICISMS\nPEOPLE HAD ABOUT CONGRESS, FRANKLY, IS THAT WE HAVE NOT\nFOCUSED ENOUGH ON MAKING SURE THAT COMPANIES ARE HELD\nACCOUNTABLE AND THEY PERFORM TO THE BENEFIT OF CONSUMERS, NOT\nJUST STOCK HOLDERS. >> IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE YOU\nWOULD CALL JOHN STUMPF TO THE HILL, BUT YOU PLAN ON CALLING ON\nOTHER CEOs OF OTHER BANKS. THE MORE PROACTIVE THING TO DO\nWOULD BE TO SEE IF THIS IS GOING ON AT OTHER BANKS TO PROTECT\nOTHER CONSUMERS WHO MAY NOT KNOW THIS IS GOING ON.\nWELLS FARGO SEEMS TO BE ADDRESSING IT, AT LEAST AT THIS\nPOINT. WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT CUSTOMER\nAT ANOTHER BANK IS GOING THROUGH THE SAME THING.\n>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, BY CALLING ATTENTION TO IT, THE\nINDUSTRY IS AWARE THAT WE ARE TAKING THIS NOT ROUTINELY, BUT\nTAKING IT VERY SERIOUSLY. AND, SECOND, WE WOULD LIKE TO\nSEE, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE RICH CORDRAY AND THE CURRENCY UP\nHERE, BECAUSE THEY COULD COMMENT UPON WHAT THEIR PERCEPTION IS IN\nGENERAL OF THE REST OF THE INDUSTRY.\nSO IT IS NOT JUST THE CEO OF WELLS FARGO, I THINK IT IS\nGETTING A PANEL THAT WILL FOCUS WIDER THAN JUST ONE INSTITUTION.\nBECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THIS TO BE SOMETHING THAT WE FOUND A\nSHORTCOMING, ONE INSTITUTION, BUT PERSISTENT IN OTHERS.\n>> SO ANY PLANS AT THIS POINT, YOU SAID YOU CALL UP THE HEAD OF\nTHE CONSUMER PROTECTION BUREAU, YOU ALSO CALL UP THE OTC, BUT NO\nPLANS AT THIS POINT TO ACTUALLY CALL ON OTHER BANK EXECUTIVES\nTHAT HAVE THEM ANSWER AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE SIMILAR\nCOMPENSATION SCHEMES IN PLACE? >> I THINK FRANKLY, FIRST OF\nALL, CALLING THESE HEARINGS IS A FUNCTION OF CHAIRMAN SHELBY.\nSECOND, WE WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR AT LEAST ONE\nWITNESS, BUT I THINK THE BEST PLACE TO BEGIN IN TERMS OF\nLOOKING AT THE SECTOR OVERALL IS GETTING THE EXPERT VIEWS OF THE\nREGULATORS. AND IF THEY ARE ABLE TO SUGGEST\nTHAT THERE ARE ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS, BUT THE OTHER\nTHING TO DO AND I THINK IT IS NOT THE APPROPRIATE THING TO DO\nIS SIMPLY CALL PEOPLE UP FOR A HEARING AND JUST ASK GENERALIZED\nQUESTIONS. I THINK IT HAS TO HAVE A FACTUAL\nPREDICATE. THIS ONE DOES.\nWELLS FARGO HAS ADMITTED THIS BEHAVIOR.\nTHIS IS VERY SURPRISING BEHAVIOR.\nTHE CENTRAL ASPECT OF BANKING IS TRUST BY THE DEPOSITORS AND THE\nCUSTOMERS AND THIS SEEMED TO BE A VIOLATION OF TRUST.\n>> ABSOLUTELY. WOULD YOU RULE OUT, DO YOU THINK\nWHAT SHOULD BE PUT ON THE TABLE, AT LEAST, FOR CONSIDERATION, IS\nA CEO WELLS FARGO STEPPING DOWN? >> AGAIN, I THINK THIS IS\nSOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN, YOU\nHAVE TO GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO INDICATE THE STEPS\nTHAT ARE TAKEN. MORE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT WENT ON\nWITH THE HELP, THAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS HEARING.\nTHEN, AGAIN, I THINK IT IS SOMETHING -- A DECISION THAT THE\nINSTITUTION WILL MAKE BEFORE WE EVER GET AROUND TO IT.\n>> WHERE DOES 100 MILLION GO, WHERE DOES IT GO?\nWHO GETS IT? >> IT WOULD GO BACK INTO THE\nTREASURY, ESSENTIALLY. THAT'S WHERE THE FINES FROM CFPD\nGO. THERE IS SOME, I BELIEVE, SOME\nREIMBURSEMENT TO THE CUSTOMERS, THE ACTUAL LOSSES THEY\nSUSTAINED. BUT THE FINE LIKE MOST FINES\nGOES TO THE GENERAL TREASURY. >> SENATOR, WE'LL LEAVE IT\nTHERE, THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.\nSENATOR JACK REED OF RHODE ISLAND.\nWE'LL HAVE MUCH MORE ON THE WELLS FARGO ACCOUNT SCANDAL ON\nCLOSING BELL AT 3:00 P.M. WITH SENATOR BOB MENENDEZ AND ON MAD\nMONEY AT 6:00 P.M., AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH WELLS FARGO CEO\nJOHN STUMPF. IOS 10 IS OUT, NUT MOBILE\nOPERATING SYSTEM. BUT NOW SEEING SOME REPORTS THAT\nINSTALLING THIS NEW SOFTWARE IS LEADING SOME DEVICES USELESS.\nI DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE THIS HERE.\nBUT MY FRIEND ENA FREED GAVE ME THIS.\nYOU CAN SEE WHAT HAPPENED WHEN SHE TRIED TO INSTALL IOS 10 ON\nHER DEVICE. NOT MANY DETAILS NOW.\nREACHED OUT TO APPLE FOR COMMENT.\nWE KNOW THIS IS HAPPENED BEFORE. SOME LEVELS OF GLITCHES AND BUGS\nINITIALLY, WHY PEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS IF UPDATE IMMEDIATELY.\nDON'T HAVE A NUMBER YET IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF VERIFIED\nCOMPLAINTS OUT THERE.

HOW DO WE HAVE SAFE GUARDS TO\nNOT LET THIS HAPPEN AGAIN? AND HOW PERVERSE IS THIS\nTHROUGHOUT THE INDUSTRY? >> WE HAD ROBERT CORDRAY ON\nYESTERDAY. THEY FINE THEM $100 MILLION.\nIT IS THE BIGGEST FINE THAT THAT OFFICE HAS EVER IMPOSED BUT YET\n$100 MILLION TO WELLS FARGO IS VERY LITTLE WHEN YOU CONSIDER\nTHE SCOPE OF THIS. DO YOU THINK THEY WERE FINED\nENOUGH? >> LOOK, I RESPECT WHAT THE\nCONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BOARD HAS DONE HERE, LARGEST\nFINE EVER. I AM A BIG ADVOCATE FOR THEM\nBECAUSE WE NEED A COP ON THE BEAT.\nI WAS AN ADVOCATE FOR THEM WHEN WE WROTE DODD-FRANK.\nI HAVE TO BELIEVE IN CONTEXT HERE $100 MILLION THE COST OF\nDOING BUSINESS. OBVIOUSLY, THERE WAS A CULTURE\nHERE AS IS EXHIBITED BY THE FACT THAT THE CEO TODAY SAID THEY ARE\nGOING TO END THEIR INCENTIVES WHICH OBVIOUSLY WERE PERVERSE\nTHAT DROVE THESE INDIVIDUALS TO DO WHAT THEY DID THAT ALLOW OR\nCREATED THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THIS COULD TAKE PLACE.\nSO YOU HAVE TO SAY TO YOURSELF $100 MILLION IF THAT IS THE COST\nOF DOING BUSINESS THEN IT IS NOT A DETERRENT.\nAND THE PURPOSE OF A FINE IS NOT SIMPLY TO COLLECT MONEY.\nTHE PURPOSE OF A FINE IS TO HAVE AN INDUSTRY-WIDE MESSAGE THAT\nTHIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE AND HAVE A MEANINGFUL CONSEQUENCE SO THEY\nCHANGE THEIR CULTURE CHANGE AND PRACTICE.\nI DON'T THINK THE $185 MILLION TOTAL COST IS REALLY GOING TO\nCHANGE THAT. THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT\nTO ASK THE CEO OF WELLS FARGO. WE DON'T NEED THE STORY.\nWE NEED THE TRUTH. >> IT IS ALSO A QUESTION OF\nWHETHER THE BANK ITSELF SHOULD BE FINED IN A WAY THAT MAKES IT\nMORE MEANINGFUL OR WHETHER YOU ARE LOOKING FOR INDIVIDUALS TO\nBE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. THIS GOES BACK TO THE FINANCIAL\nCRISIS. IN THIS CASE THERE IS AN\nINDIVIDUAL WHO HAS NOT BEEN SPECIFICALLY NAMED BUT IN PRESS\nREPORTS IS SAID TO HAVE RESPONSIBILITY AND MAYBE TAKING\nHOME IN EXCESS OF $100 MILLION WHILE THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING.\nIS THIS ABOUT ISOLATING THE INDIVIDUALS WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN\nMORE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS THAN JUST TRYING TO HAVE THE BANK\nWHICH IS SO ENORMOUS BE THE ONE THAT IS BEARING THE BRUNT OF THE\nOUTRAGE? >> FOR ME IT IS NOT JUST BEARING\nTHE BRUNT OF THE OUTRAGE. IT IS ENDING SUCH PRACTICES AND\nSENDING AN INDUSTRY WIDE MESSAGE THAT SUCH PRACTICES ARE NOT\nACCEPTABLE. THAT CAN BE DONE BY SIGNIFICANT\nFINES. IT SEEMS TO ME AND WE DON'T KNOW\nTHIS, IF THERE IS ANY CRIMINAL ACTION PERFORMED BY ANYBODY IN\nTHE PROCESS OF THIS IF THERE WAS A COORDINATEDEFT TO DO THIS AND\nSYSTEMIC EFFORT TO DO THIS THEN THAT NEEDS TO BE PROSECUTED\nBECAUSE BIG BANKS SHOULD NOT BE TOO BIG TO BE PROSECUTED AND TO\nBE JAILED IN TERMS OF INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY.\nI DON'T KNOW YET BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE FACTS BUT\nWHEN YOU HAVE THE PERSON WHO HEADED THIS DIVISION ULTIMATELY\nWALK AWAY WITH $124 MILLION AND YOU ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT\nCLAWBACK SOMETHING IS WRONG. >> WHAT MORE CAN BE DONE TO\nREGULATE THE INDUSTRY SO SOMETHING LIKE THIS DOESN'T\nHAPPEN? ALREADY DODD-FRANK YOU HAVEN'T\nBEEN ABLE TO ENACT ALL OF DODD-FRANK.\nIT IS STILL UNFOLDING AS WE SPEAK.\nIS THERE SOMETHING ELSE THAT YOU CAN DO TO TRY AND KEEP THAT KIND\nOF BEHAVIOR FROM HAPPENING AGAIN?\n>> WELL, LOOK, WE NEED TO STRENGTHEN THE CONSUMER\nFINANCIAL PROTECTION BOARD. I KNOW MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES\nWANT TO SLAY IT, KILL ITS BUDGET AND AUTHORITY.\nHERE IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHY YOU NEED A COP ON THE BEAT.\nYOU NEED TO AS YOU LEARN THE LESSONS THINK ABOUT WHAT\nREGULATORY AND/OR LEGISLATIVE KAF GUARDS YOU CAN CREATE.\nI WOULD HOPE THAT THE INDUSTRY WOULD COME FORWARD AND SAY WE\nLEARNED FROM THIS AND AS A RESULT OF THIS WE ARE NOT GOING\nTO DO PERVERSE INCENTIVES SO THAT THEY CAN COME FORWARD AND\nBE PART OF THE SOLUTION AND THEN IT IS THE PUNISHMENT SIDE OF\nTHIS. IF, IN FACT, YOU ARE CAUGHT HERE\nTHE PUNISHMENT HAS TO BE SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH THAT YOU\nDON'T THINK IT IS THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS OTHERWISE WE WILL\nSEE ACTIONS LIKE THESE TAKE PLACE TIME AND TIME AGAIN.\nTHAT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE TO CONSIDER.\n>> THANK YOU, SIR. >> YOU ARE WATCHING THAT SENATE\nBANKING COMMITTEE HEARING NEXT TUESDAY.\nBIG INTERVIEW TONIGHT WELLS FARGO CHAIRMAN JOHN STUMPF WILL\nBE ON MAD MONEY.

AND TO BE -- TO BE AT THE HOUSE\nREPUBLICAN CONFERENCE TODAY WAS A GREAT PRIVILEGE.\nPARTICULARLY WANT TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO PAUL RYAN.\nHIS DEVELOPMENT OF THE BETTER WAY AGENDA.\nSO ALIGNS WITH DONALD TRUMP'S VISION TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT\nAGAIN. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SHOULD BE\nCONFIDENT THAT 56 DAYS FROM NOW, WE CAN ELECT A PRESIDENT AND\nRE-ELECT MAJORITIES IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE THAT WILL BE READY ON\nDAY ONE TO RESTORE AMERICAN STRENGTH AT HOME AND ABROAD.\nTHE HOUSE'S COMMITMENT TO AND PLANS TO REBUILD OUR MILITARY,\nREDUCE TAXES, END THE WAR ON AMERICAN ENERGY, ROLL BACK JOB\nKILLING REGULATIONS, REPEAL OBAMACARE AND SUPPORT THE KINDS\nOF POLICIES THAT WILL RESULT IN A STRONGER MORE PROSPEROUS\nAMERICA. REPRESENTS AN EXTRAORDINARY\nSTART ON THE IMPORTANT WORK WE HAVE TO DO AS A COUNTRY.\n7 1/2 YEARS OF THE LEADERSHIP OF BARACK OBAMA AND HILLARY CLINTON\nDURING HER YEARS AS SECRETARY OF STATE HAVE WEAKENED AMERICA'S\nPLACE IN THE WORLD AND STIFLED AMERICA'S ECONOMY.\nWITH THE STRONG LEADERSHIP DONALD TRUMP WILL BRING TO THE\nWHITE HOUSE WITH OUR STRONG PARTNERS IN THE HOUSE AND THE\nSENATE, LEADERS, MEMBERS OF WHICH I'LL BE MEETING WITH LATER\nTODAY. WE'RE VERY CONFIDENT WE CAN\nBRING REAL CHANGE IN REAL TIME TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\nI LEAVE HERE TODAY WITH A GRATEFUL HEART TO BE AMONG MY\nFRIENDS AND THOSE MEN AND WOMEN THAT I HOPE AND PRAY WE HAVE THE\nOPPORTUNITY TO WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THIS COUNTRY GREAT AGAIN.\nQUESTIONS. >> SIR, YOU'RE AN --\n>> HEY, HEY, WE DON'T DO IT THAT WAY.\nWE DON'T DO IT THAT WAY. GO AHEAD.\n[ INAUDIBLE QUESTION ] >> LET ME SAY FIRST AND FOREMOST\nI THINK MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WERE SHOCKED AND SADDENED TO SEE\nHILLARY CLINTON REFER TO PEOPLE ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AS A BASKET\nOF DEPLORABLES IN A PREPARED SPEECH BEFORE WEALTHY DONORS IN\nNEW YORK CITY ON FRIDAY NIGHT. SHE SAID THAT AT THE TIME HALF\nOF THE PEOPLE SUPPORTING DONALD TRUMP AND I WERE IRREDEEMABLE,\nWERE NOT AMERICAN AND, FRANKLY, I'VE NEVER HEARD A MAJOR PARTY\nCANDIDATE IN THE UNITED STATES SPEAK ABOUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\nWITH SUCH CONTEMPT. I'M OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL\nEVERY DAY. I'M CAMPAIGNING WITH DONALD\nTRUMP AND FOR DONALD TRUMP. AND WHAT HILLARY CLINTON\nAPPARENTLY DOESN'T KNOW IS THE PEOPLE SUPPORTING THIS CAMPAIGN\nARE HARD-WORKING AMERICANS WHO COME OUT TO OUR RALLIES, STOP US\nIN DINERS, VISIT WITH US AT MEETINGS AT FACTORIES.\nTHEY'RE PEOPLE THAT WORK WITH THEIR HANDS.\nTHEY'RE PEOPLE WHO RUN BUSINESSES.\nTHEY'RE VETERANS. LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.\nMOMS AND DADS AND FORMERS. FOR HILLARY CLINTON TO EXPRESS\nSUCH DISDAIN FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICANS I THINK IS ONE MORE\nREASON THAT DISQUALIFIED HER TO SERVE IN THE HIGHEST OFFICE OF\nTHE LAND. ANYONE WHO HAS THAT LOW AN\nOPINION OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SHOULD NEVER SERVE AS PRESIDNT\nOF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AS I SAID THIS WEEKEND, I'LL SAY\nAGAIN, DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTERS ARE NOT A BASKET OF ANYTHING.\nTHEY ARE AMERICANS AND THEY DESERVE THE RESPECT OF THE\nDEMOCRAT NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nDONALD TRUMP I SAID HIS AMBITION IS TO BE PRESIDENT OF ALL THE\nPEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\nAS HE SAID THIS WEEKEND, WE BELIEVE FROM OUR HEART, EVEN\nTHOUGH WHO DID NOT SUPPORT US, EVEN THOSE WHO ARE CRITICAL OF\nUS OR HAVE STRONGLY DIFFERENT VIEWS HAVE OUR RESPECT BECAUSE\nTHEY ARE AMERICANS AND WE RESPECT THEIR RIGHT TO THEIR\nVIEWS AND IT WOULD BE THE HIGHEST HONOR OF OUR LIFE TO\nSERVE THEM. NOW, WITH REGARD TO YOUR\nQUESTION, I WILL TELL YOU, A QUESTION I CONTINUE TO -- FOR\nALL THE WORLD, I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THIS MAN KEEPS COMING UP.\nI MEAN, DONALD TRUMP AND I HAVE DENOUNCED DAVID DUKE REPEATEDLY.\nWE HAVE SAID THAT WE DO NOT WANT HIS SUPPORT.\nAND WE DO NOT WANT THE SUPPORT OF PEOPLE WHO THINK LIKE HIM.\nAND YESTERDAY I WAS -- I WAS ASKED A QUESTION ABOUT THAT.\nI REPEATED THAT AGAIN. AND THE SIMPLE FACT IS I'M NOT\nIN THE NAME CALLING BUSINESS. MY COLLEAGUES KNOW I BELIEVE\nCIVILITY IS ESSENTIAL. I'M ALSO NOT GOING TO VALIDATE\nTHE LANGUAGE THAT HILLARY CLINTON USED TO DESCRIBE THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE. I MEAN, LOOK, MILLIONS OF\nAMERICANS KNOW AND FRANKLY YOU ALL KNOW HILLARY CLINTON WASN'T\nTALKING ABOUT THAT BAD MAN. SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE ALL\nACROSS THIS COUNTRY. WHO ARE COMING OUT IN RECORD\nNUMBERS TO STAND BY DONALD TRUMP AND TO STAND WITH HIM IN HIS\nVISION TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.\nWE'LL CALL ON HER AGAIN. TO APOLOGIZE AND RETRACT HER\nCOMMENTS. THE ONLY THING SHE SAID SO FAR\nIS SHE WAS WRONG ABOUT THE MATH I GUESS AND SHE'S SORRY SHE SAID\nHALF. THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS HER\nREMARKS WERE DEEPLY INSULTING TO SINCERE PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THIS\nCOUNTRY WHO KNOW WE CAN DO BETTER WHO KNOW WE CAN BE\nSTRONGER, AND WE CALL ON HILLARY CLINTON AND HER CAMPAIGN ONCE\nAGAIN TO FULLY RETRACT THOSE OFFENSE ITCH STATEMENTS AND\nAPOLOGIZE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AS SHE SHOULD.\n>> GOVERNOR, DO YOU HAVE ANY CONCERNS THAT -- WHETHER IT'S\nDAVID DUKE OR OTHERS WHO HOLD VIEWS THAT ARE CONSIDERED RACIST\nOR MISOGYNIST OR ANY OF THOSE THINGS, THAT THEY ARE ATTRACTED\nTO YOUR CAMPAIGN AND WANT TO ATTACH THEMSELVES TO YOU?\nAGAIN TODAY DAVID DUKE TALKED ABOUT YOU SPECIFICALLY.\nARE YOU CONCERNED THAT THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE TRUMP/PENCE\nCANDIDACY IN THESE POLITICAL TIMES AND THE RHETORIC THAT'S\nBEEN USED THAT DRAWS THEM TO YOU?\n>> LOOK, WE LIVE IN A FREE COUNTRY AND PEOPLE OF ILL\nMOTIVES CAN ASSOCIATE THEMSELVES WITH POLITICS.\nI WOULD DRAW NO MORE CONCLUSION OF THAT MAN'S EX-EXPRESSIONS OF\nSUPPORT THAN I WOULD THE FACT THAT THE FATHER OF A TERRORIST\nWHO KILLED 49 AMERICANS WAS SEEN AT A HILLARY CLINTON RALLY\nCHEERING HER ON AND SAID HE WAS THERE BECAUSE SHE WAS IF ON\nNATIONAL SECURITY. I MEAN, LOOK, FOLKS, THERE ARE\nTWO PEOPLE ON THE BALLOT HERE. HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD\nTRUMP. ONE OF THEM IS GOING TO BE\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\nAND I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU THIS IS ALL A DISTRACTION.\nI GET IT. I UNDERSTAND WHY HILLARY CLINTON\nAND HER CAMPAIGN WANT TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT AFTER THAT SPEECH ON\nFRIDAY NIGHT. WE ALL HAVE RECOGNIZED.\nYOU IN THE MEDIA HAVE VRECOGNIZD THIS WAS A CATASTROPHIC INSULT\nTO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT\nPEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY KNOW THIS WAS A PREPARED SPEECH.\nTHIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME SHE CALLED MILLIONS OF AMERICANS A\nBASKET OF DEPLORABLES. I JUST -- AS I SAID, I THINK\nANYONE THAT'S GOT THAT LOW OF AN OPINION OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\nSHOULD NEVER SERVE IN THE HIGHEST OFFICE OF THE LAND.\nJUAN. [ INAUDIBLE ]\n>> IT'S KIND OF NICE FOR A CHANGE.\nGO AHEAD. >> -- ON THE NCAA DECISION TO\nBAN SOME OF ITS CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES OUT OF NORTH CAROLINA\nOVER WAYS PERCEIVED AS AN ANTI-LGBT LAW?\nTHE NBA HAS DONE SOMETHING SIMILAR WITH THE ALL-STAR GAME.\n>> I JUST HEARD ABOUT THAT THIS MORNING AND WOULDN'T HAVE THE\nDETAILS TO COMMENT OTHER THAN TO SAY THE NCAA IS BASED IN\nINDIANAPOLIS. WE HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP\nWITH THE NCAA IT AND DONALD TRUMP AND I SIMPLY BELIEVE THAT\nTHESE DECISIONS ARE BEST MADE AT THE STATE LEVEL BY THE PEOPLE\nAND WHERE DISPUTES ARISE THEY SHOULD BE RESOLVED IN THE\nCOURTS. >> LAST QUESTION.\n>> GOVERNOR PENCE -- >> THIS GUY RIGHT HERE.\nHE WAS PATIENT AND HE WASN'T SCREAMING SHOUTING OUT SO --\n>> THANK YOU. GOVERNOR PENCE, SPEAKER RYAN\nHAS -- >> OKAY, SOMEBODY ELSE.\nTHANKS, MAN. YEAH, YEAH.\n>> -- MORE DIFFICULT -- >> I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T HEAR THE\nQUESTION. >> I DIDN'T HEAR THE QUESTION\nEITHER. I CAN TELL WHERE YOU'RE GOING.\n>> SPEAKER RYAN HAS REPEATEDLY AND AT TIMES FORCEFULLY REBUKED\nDONALD TRUMP FOR SOME OF HIS REMARKS.\nI'M WONDERING IF THAT MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR YOU AS YOU REACH\nOUT TO REPUBLICANS ON THE FENCE AND IF THAT'S BEEN HURTFUL TO\nTHE CAMPAIGN. >> MY AND DONALD TRUMP'S RESPECT\nAND APPRECIATION FOR SPEAKER PAUL RYAN IS BOUNDLESS.\nLOOK, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE -- IN A MAJORITY PARTY, YOU'RE GOING\nTO HAVE DIFFERENCE OF OPINIONS BUT YOUR GOALS ARE IDENTICAL.\nMEETING I HAD WITH THIS SPEAKER IS HOW MUCH CONSISTENCY THERE IS\nBETWEEN DONALD TRUMP'S VISION TO REBUILD OUR MILITARY, REVIVE THE\nAMERICAN ECONOMY, UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW.\nAND THE AGENT TA THAT HOUSE REPUBLICANS HAVE PUT FORWARD IN\nTHE BETTER WAY. I REALLY DO BELIEVE WE HAVE AN\nHISTORIC OPPORTUNITY BEFORE US TODAY WITH THE ENORMOUS TALENT\nHERE IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES LED BY SPEAKER\nPAUL RYAN WITH THE ENERGY AND THE VISION OF A PRESIDENT DONALD\nTRUMP AND RE-ELECTED REPUBLICAN SENATE TO TURN THIS COUNTRY\nAROUND. AND TO TURN IT AROUND VERY\nQUICKLY. I MEAN, I SAID TO THE CONFERENCE\nTODAY, THIS IS THE MOST DRAMATIC CHOICE IN AN ELECTION IN MY\nLIFETIME. THIS IS NOT A CHOICE BETWEEN ONE\nCANDIDATE WHO WILL GROW AMERICA THIS MUCH AND ANOTHER CANDIDATE\nWHO WILL GROW AMERICA THIS MUCH. THIS LITERALLY SAY CHOICE\nBETWEEN WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO GO DOWNHILL TO A\nWEAKER AMERICA AT HOME AND ABROAD.\nWHETHER WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WALK AWAY FROM THE\nCONSTITUTIONAL LIBERTIES ENSHRINED IN THE INTERPRETATION\nOF THOSE BY OUR SUPREME COURT. WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO WALK AWAY\nFROM THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF INTEGRITY OF THE HIGHEST OFFICE\nOF THE LAND. WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO PLANT OUR\nFEET AND START TO MARCH BACKUP HILL TOWARDS GREATER STRENGTH\nAND GREATER PROSPERITY. HOUSE REPUBLICANS, SENATE\nREPUBLICANS ARE DEEPLY COMMITTED TO MARCHING UP THAT HILL.\nWHEN WE ELECT DONALD TRUMP AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES OF AMERICA, THEY WILL HAVE A TEAM AND A PARTNER IN THE\nWHITE HOUSE TO MARCH BACK UP TO A STRONGER AND GREATER AMERICA.\nALL RIGHT. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT WAS\nSAID AT THIS GOP LEADERSHIP PRESSER.\nWE'LL HEAR FROM MANU RAJU WHO WAS IN THAT ROOM IN A MOMENT.\nWHY WAS MIKE PENCE THERE? >> FIRST AND FOREMOST, REALLY\nWANTS TO MAKE THIS CONSERVATIVES FEEL THIS RACE IS NOT SLIPPING\nAWAY FROM THEM. MAKE HOUSE REPUBLICANS FEEL\nDESPITE WHAT THEY MAY SEE IN THE PRESS OR HEAR FROM THE\nCONSTITUENTS THAT THE TOP OF THE TICKET IS FINE AND WITH THEM.\nDONALD TRUMP IS SIMPLY NOT ONE OF THEM.\nTHESE HOUSE REPUBLICANS WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR OWN MAJORITY\nWANT SOME COMFORT. MIKE PENCE SERVED IN THAT BODY\nFOR 12 YEARS. HE'S SOMETHING LIKE XANAX I\nTHINK FOR THESE CONSERVATIVES WHO ARE JITTERY, WORRIED ABOUT\nWHAT DONALD TRUMP MAY DO TO THE TOP OF THE TICKET.\nHE'S THERE TO REASSURE PEOPLE, SORT OF GIVE THEM SOME MARCHING\nORDERS HERE ON WHAT THEY SHOULD BE GOING AFTER AND THAT IS\nHILLARY CLINTON'S DEPLORABLE LINE.\n>> MIKE PENCE HELD A PRIVATE MEETING WITH THE GOP LEADERSHIP\nAND HE TOLD MANY, MANY PERSONAL STORIES ABOUT DONALD TRUMP.\nSAID HE JUST WISHED THE HOUSE LEADERSHIP COULD KNOW DONALD\nTRUMP AS MIKE PENCE DOES BECAUSE HE'S SUCH A WARM HUMAN BEING.\nWHY TELL PERSONAL STORIES LIKE THAT?\n>> I THINK AS JEFF WAS SAYING, HE DEFINITELY HAS SOME CLOUD\nWITH HOUSE REPUBLICANS THERE. I THINK IT MAKES THEM AS A\nTICKET CERTAINLY MORE RELATABLE. HE HAD RELATIONSHIPS POINT BLANK\nON CAPITOL HILL THAT TRUMP DOES NOT HAVE.\nHIM BECOMING SOMETHING OF A CHARACTER WITNESS FOR DONALD\nTRUMP IS AN IMPORTANT ROLE THAT HE WILL PLAY NOT ONLY THE\nCAMPAIGN TRAIL. WE'VE STARTED TO SEE HIM DO THAT\nALL AROUND THIS COUNTRY. BUT ESPECIALLY ON CAPITOL HILL\nWHERE THERE ARE SOME REPUBLICANS WHO ARE STILL UNSURE OF DONALD\nTRUMP AND UNSURE OF THEM AS A TICKET.\nSO MIKE PENCE CERTAINLY PLAYING HIS ROLE HERE AS HIS RUNNING\nMATE. >> I KNOW -- I'M SURE THE WORD\n\"UNITY\" CAME UP MANY TIMES IN THAT CLOSED DOOR MEETING TOO.\nOF COURSE REPORTERS ASKED MIKE PENCE ABOUT DAVID DUKE.\nWHEN PENCE WAS ON WOLF'S SHOW YESTERDAY, HE DID NOT\nDENOUNCE -- WE, HE DENOUNCED DAVID DUKE BUT HE DIDN'T SAY HE\nWAS DEPLORABLE. LET'S LISTEN TO WHAT MIKE PENCE\nSAID TODAY. >> DAVID DUKE REPEATEDLY WE HAVE\nSAID THAT WE DO NOT WANT HIS SUPPORT AND WE DO NOT WANT THE\nSUPPORT OF PEOPLE WHO -- >> WE HAD A TECHNICAL PROBLEM\nTHERE, BUT MIKE PENCE AGAIN SAID HE'S INTO CIVILITY, LARRY, HE\nDOESN'T LIKE TO CALL PEOPLE NAMES.\nHE SAID DONALD TRUMP AND HIMSELF DENOUNCED DAVID DUKE MANY TIMES.\nWAS IT A FAIR QUESTION? >> OH, ABSOLUTELY.\nBECAUSE, AGAIN, JUST TO REFRESH PEOPLE'S MINDS, SOME MONTHS AGO,\nDONALD TRUMP DID NOT IMMEDIATELY DENOUNCE DAVID DUKE.\nHE TENDED TO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HIS EAR PIECE, HIS IFB, AND\nCLAIMED HE DIDN'T HEAR THE NAME DAVID DUKE.\nTHE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, AND WHETHER VICE PRESIDENTIAL\nNOMINEE MIKE PENCE ADMITS IT OR NOT, THERE ARE A LOT OF THESE\nWHITE NATIONALISTS WHO HAVE SEIZED UPON THE TRUMP CANDIDACY\nAND USED IT IN THEIR OWN WAYS TO PROMOTE THEIR AGENDA.\nTHEY'RE ALL OVER TWITTER. SO IT IS A PROBLEM.\nI THINK FRANKLY TRUMP AND PENCE WOULD DO WELL TO DENOUNCE THESE\nPEOPLE IN THE STRONGEST NATURAL TERMS.\nMAYBE THEY'RE NOT DEPLORABLE. I WOULD SAY DEPLORABLE IS TOO\nNICE A TERM FOR THEM. >> HE COULD HAVE COME UP WITH\nANOTHER ADJECTIVE. LET'S CHECK IN WITH MANU RAJU.\nHE WAS LISTENING AS THAT PRESS CONFERENCE WAS GOING ON.\nPENCE CLEARLY KNEW HE WAS GOING TO BE ASKED THAT QUESTION.\nHE WAS READY, MANU. >> YEAH, HE WAS.\nACTUALLY IN THIS MEETING THAT HAPPENED RIGHT BEFOREHAND, I WAS\nTOLD THIS REALLY DID NOT COME UP.\nTHIS IS AN HOUR-LONG MEETING HE HAD WITH HOUSE REPUBLICANS AFTER\nHE MET WITH SPEAKER PAUL RYAN. IN THAT MEETING, ACTUALLY,\nCAROL, IT WAS MORE OF A PEP RALLY MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE.\nTHEY TALK ABOUT UNITY, TALKING ABOUT HOW THE PARTY IS DOING\nBETTER. PENCE TRYING TO MAKE THE CASE\nACTUALLY TO HIS COLLEAGUES THAT THEY HAVE MOMENTUM BEHIND THE\nTOP OF THE TICKET. EVEN HOUSE REPUBLICANS, I'M\nTOLD, THE LEADER OF THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN EFFORT TO KEEP THE\nHOUSE MAJORITY SAID -- PRESENTED POLLING SHOWING THAT MIKE PENCE\nAND DONALD TRUMP AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET ACTUALLY ARE NOT\nHURTING DOWN TICKET CANDIDATES, ACTUALLY MAY BE HELPING IN SOME\nAREAS. WHEN MIKE PENCE CAME HERE AND\nADDRESSED THE PRESS, OF COURSE HE EXPECTED THAT QUESTION.\nHE REALLY DIDN'T DEVIATE FROM WHAT HE SAID YESTERDAY.\nTRYING TO MAKE CLEAR HE DENOUNCES DAVID DUKE.\nHE MAY NOT USE THE SAME TERMINOLOGY AS HILLARY CLINTON.\nSAYS HE'S NOT A NAME CALLER. BUT REALLY VIEWS IT AS A\nDISTINCTION WITHOUT A DIFFERENCE.\nTRYING TO DENOUNCE HIM. WHAT HE VIEWS AS THE STRONG ET\nPOSSIBLE TERMS. WHAT WILL BE INTERESTING TO HEAR\nIS WHETHER OR NOT PAUL RYAN WOULD ALSO AGREE WITH THAT.\nHE WOULD CALL DAVID DUKE DEPLORABLE.\nTHEY DID NOT TAKE MANY QUESTIONS.\nWE WEREN'T ABLE TO GET THAT QUESTION TO HIM.\nBUT CLEARLY THIS WAS AN EFFORT BY MIKE PENCE TO SHOW THAT THE\nPARTY IS UNITED BEHIND THE TICKET.\nHE WAS ASKED SPECIFICALLY ALSO WHETHER OR NOT PAUL RYAN'S\nCRITICISM OF DONALD TRUMP HAS HURT THE TOP OF THE TICKET.\nMIKE PENCE MAKING CLEAR THAT'S FINE.\nTHERE ARE DISAGREEMENTS ALL THE TIME WITHIN A PARTY.\nAND EXPRESSING HIS APPRECIATION FOR PAUL RYAN.\nA MUCH DIFFERENT MOOD HERE IN SEPTEMBER THAN IT WAS IN JULY\nWHEN DONALD TRUMP CAME TO MEET WITH HOUSE REPUBLICANS AND ONE\nREASON WHY, CAROL, POLL NUMBERS IMPROVING, HELPING THOSE\nBATTLEGROUND STATES. REPUBLICANS A LITTLE MORE\nCONFIDENT OF KEEPING THE MAJORITY IN CONGRESS AND ALSO\nDONALD TRUMP'S CHANCES IN NOVEMBER.\n>> OF COURSE DURING THIS PRESS CONFERENCE, THE REPUBLICAN\nLEADERSHIP ALSO BROUGHT UP THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY.\nTHEY SAID THE ECONOMY WAS GOING NOWHERE.\nBUT THE CENSUS DATA CAME OUT AND SHOWNED THE MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD\nINCOME ROSE TO $56,516 A YEAR. THAT'S UP 5.2% OVER THE LAST\nYEAR. SO MEDIAN INCOMES ARE RISING.\nTHE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS 4.9%. SO, JEFF, CAN THEY REALLY MAKE\nTHE CASE THAT THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO SINK?\nOH, BY THE WAY, PRESIDENT OBAMA'S APPROVAL RATING IN AN\nABC/\"WASHINGTON POST\" POLL IS NOW AT 58%.\n>> IT GETS HARDER FOR THEM TO MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT THINGS\nARE TERRIBLE HERE IN THE COUNTRY.",

DID YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO SPEAK\nWITH HILLARY CLINTON THERE BEFORE SHE LEFT?\nAND IF YOU DID, HOW DID SHE SEEM TO YOU AT THAT EVENT?\n>> WOLF, SHE SEEMED GOOD. I SPOKE TO HER FOR A WHILE.\nIT WAS A VERY CROWDED SPACE, VERY HOT, AND PEOPLE WERE COMING\nUP TO HER, CONVERSATION AFTER CONVERSATION.\nSHE SEEMED GOOD. I'VE KNOWN HILLARY FOR 16 YEARS,\nSHE HAS EXTRAORDINARY STAMINA. EXTRAORDINARY WORK ETHIC.\nIT DOES NOT SURPRISE ME ONE BIT THAT EVEN THOUGH SHE WASN'T\nFEELING WELL, AND SHE COULD HAVE SAID HEY, I NEED A FEW DAYS\nDOWN, IT'S NOT LIKE HER. SHE TRIES TO WORK THROUGH\nEVERYTHING. SHE WAS GREETING EVERYONE,\nPERFECTLY ENERGETIC. BUT LOOK, THE BOTTOM LINE HERE\nIS, WE KNOW A LOT ABOUT HILLARY CLINT\nCLINTON'S HEALTH. SHE'S HAD SOME CHALLENGES,\nADDRESSED THEM. AS SECRETARY OF STATE, SHE DID\nAN AMAZING JOB ON CRISIS AFTER CRISIS.\nWE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S HEALTH EXCEPT A\nLETTER WHERE HIS PHYSICIAN SAID HE WOULD BE THE HEALTHIEST\nPRESIDENT WE'VE EVER HAD.

HE HASN'T RELEASED HIS TAXES.\n>> WE'LL SEE IF HE DOES RELEASE THE RESULTS OF THE PHYSICAL,\nWHAT ELSE RERELEASES AND WHAT STANDARD BOTH OF THESE\nCANDIDATES WILL RELEASE INFORMATION.\nSHOULDN'T HILLARY CLINTON HAVE BEEN TRANSPARENTED AND RELEASED\nTHE FACT THAT SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA RIGHT AWAY?\n>> I DON'T THINK HAVING A DIAGNOSIS LIKE THAT REQUIRES\nPUBLIC DISCLOSURE. SHE HAD EVERY RIGHT TO SPEND A\nFEW DAYS RECUPERATING, JUST LIKE ANYONE ELSE.\nSHE HAD ALLERGY ISSUES, SHE WAS TAKING ANTIHISTAMINES FOR THAT.\nI DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO ALERT THE PUBLIC EVERY TIME THAT\nYOU'RE SICK, YOU GO TO THE DOCTOR AND THEY SAY HERE'S A\nMEDICATION YOU HAVE TO TAKE. THAT'S MORE OF A PERCEPTION\nQUESTION THAN A VALUES QUESTION. THE BOTTOM LINE HERE, IS SHE\nSOMEONE READY FOR THE RIGGORS O THE PRESIDENCY?\nTHERE'S NO QUESTION SHE'S READY FOR IT.\nAND THE WAY SHE'S BEEN COMPORTING HERSELF ON THIS\nCAMPAIGN NOW, A YEAR AND A HALF CRISSCROSSING THE COUNTRY.\nDONALD TRUMP IS TRYING TO CREATE A HEALTH SCARE AROUND HILLARY\nCLINTON.

SO SOME OF THIS IS THE POSTURING\nOF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN THAT'S CAUGHT A LITTLE FIRE NOW.\nBUT I DON'T THINK THE ESSENTIAL TRUTH IS ACTUALLY A CONCERN.\nWE KNOW A LOT ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON.\nWE KNOW SHE'S HEALTHY. >> BUT WE WERE ALL ALARMED WHEN\nWE SAW THAT VIDEO. I'M SURE YOU WERE AALARMED, AS\nWELL. SHE LEFT THE 9/11 EVENT EARLY,\nSHE WAS BEING ESCORTED. AS SHE WALKS INTO THAT VAN, SHE\nCOLLAPSES. THERE YOU'LL SEE IT RIGHT THERE.\nSHE GOES DOWN. THEY CARRY HER INTO THE VAN.\nWE SAW THAT VIDEO. I'M SURE YOU AGREE, IT WAS VERY,\nVERY DISTURBING. >> WELL, WOLF, YOU KNOW, WE'VE\nSEEN OVER THE YEARS LEADERS WHO WERE DEHYDRATED AND I REMEMBER\nONCE WHEN GEORGE H.W. BUSH WAS ON THAT PRESIDENTIAL TRIP TO\nJAPAN AND HAD AN EPISODE AT A STATE DINNER IN JAPAN.\nIT'S NOT UNHEARD OF FOR PEOPLE WHO WORK THIS HARD TO HAVE THESE\nMOMENTS. BUT AS YOU SAW AN HOUR OR TWO\nLATER, SHE WAS OUT WAVING TO THE CAMERAS AND HER OLD SELF.\nTEN MINUTES EARLIER, I WAS RIGHT NEXT TO HER AT THE TIME SHE LEFT\nTHE EVENT AND SHE WAS CHATTING WITH EVERYONE.\nI JUST THINK THE HEAT GOT TO HER AND SHE WAS DEALING WITH THIS\nCONDITION FOR A FEW DAYS. BUT WE SHOULDN'T MAKE MORE OF\nIT. WE HAVE TO GET TO THE CORE ISSUE\nHERE. IS SHE SOMEONE WELL QUALIFIED TO\nBE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES?\nIN EVERY SENSE, PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST QUALIFIED EVER,\nINCLUDING EXHIBITED THE STAMINA YOU NEED FOR THAT JOB.\nSHE'S A KNOWN QUANTITY. MY QUESTION IS, SINCE DONALD\nTRUMP HAS NEVER BEEN IN PUBLIC SERVICE, HE'S LIVERED A VERY\nPAMPERED LIFESTYLE, CAN HE KEEP ONE THE RIGORS OF THE\nPRESIDENCY? WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF EVIDENCE\nABOUT THAT. >> BACK IN 2008, JOHN McCAIN\nALLOWED REPORTERS TO REVIEW EIGHT YEARS' WORTH OF HIS\nMEDICAL RECORDS. HE WAS 70-YEAR-OLD OLD AT THE\nTIME. REPORTERS WERE ALSO ALLOWED TO\nINTERVIEW HIS DOCTORS. SHOULD HILLARY CLINTON, WHO IS\nALMOST 69, AND DONALD TRUMP WHO IS 70, DO THE SAME THING RIGHT\nNOW TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC, THE VOTERS OUT\nTHERE WHO HAVE TO ELECT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES\nTHAT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE? >> LOOK, I THINK DISCLOSURE IS\nALWAYS HELPFUL. I THINK THERE'S STILL SOME\nISSUES OF PRIVACY THAT PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO, EVEN WHEN THEY\nRUN FOR OFFICE. IT'S DIFFERENT THAN TAXES.\nOBVIOUSLY, HILLARY CLINTON HAS RELEASED HER TAX RETURNS GOING\nMANY YEARS BACK. DONALD TRUMP HAS NOT.\nON HEALTH RECORDS, HILLARY CLINTON'S ALREADY PROVIDED THE\nLEVEL OF HEALTH RECORDS THAT WE HAVE SEEN FROM REPUBLICAN AND\nDEMOCRATIC NOMINEES FOR PRESIDENTS IN RECENT YEARS.\nAND SHE SAID THAT MORE IS COMING AND I BELIEVE HER.\nSHE HAS A HISTORY OF PROVIDING THESE RECORDS.\nI THINK WE'LL HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION WE NEED.\nTHE QUESTION IS, AGAIN, I DON'T TAKE IT ON FACE VALUE DONALD\nTRUMP WILL RELEASE ANYTHING. IT'S AN OPEN QUESTION.\nAND HE HAS NO EXPERIENCE WITH HAVING TO BE TRANSPARENT,\nBECAUSE HE'S BEEN SOMEONE WHO, IN ALL OF HIS BUSINESS DEALINGS,\nBENEFITED FROM KEEPING THINGS SECRET AND LIVED THE LIFE AGAIN\nOF A BILLIONAIRE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR.\nI THINK WE KNOW A LOT ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHE BIG QUESTION FOR ME, WHAT IS THE TRUTH ABOUT DONALD TRUMP?\n>> WE'LL SEE WHAT HE RELEASES LATER THIS WEEK.\nAS FAR AS SHE'S CONCERNED, DOES IT HURT HER WITH VOTERS WHO -- A\nLOT OF WHOM ARE HAVING TROUBLE TRUSTING HER, FOR EXAMPLE, IF\nSHE ISN'T MORE FORTHCOMING, SHE'S FORTHCOMING ON HER TAX\nRETURNS. SHE'S RELEASED 20 YEARS WORTH OF\nHER TAX RETURNS. BUT WITH HER HEALTH, SHOULD SHE\nBE MORE FORTH COMING? >> THERE'S A LEVEL OF\nTRANSPARENCY THAT HELPS BUT STILL A RIGHT OF PRIVACY THAT\nEVERY PERSON HAS. IT WAS VERY GOOD WHEN THIS CAME\nUP TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SHE WAS SUFFERING FROM PNEUMONIA AND\nMEDICATION SHE WAS TAKING. OBVIOUSLY, WE EXPECT A QUICK\nRECOVERY. THE BOTTOM LINE ON ALL OF THESE\nTHINGS IS HOW DO WE GET TO KNOW A CANDIDATE AND WHAT THEY'RE\nGOING TO DO FOR US? ONE OF THE THINGS WE SEEN ABOUT\nHILLARY CLINTON IS SHE'S GOT A CHALLENGE.\nIF THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH HILLARY CLINTON, IT IS SHE WORKS\nTOO HARD. SHE DOESN'T TAKE THE TIME\nALWAYS. I CAN SAY THIS FROM PERSONAL\nEXPERIENCE, SHE DOESN'T ALWAYS TAKE THE TIME SHE SHOULD FOR\nHERSELF. IT'S NOT SURPRISING SHE TRIED TO\nPOWER THROUGH THIS. AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES, MY ADVICE WOULD BE, YOU DESERVE A LITTLE DOWNTIME.\nBUT I WOULD RATHER HAVE SOMEONE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT WHOSE\nPROBLEM IS THEY WORK TOO HARD AND WHO TRIES TO POWER THROUGH A\nDISEASE AND KEEP DOING WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING.\nI THINK THAT'S A VERY PRESIDENTIAL ATTRIBUTE.\nAND I HAVE A LOT OF FAITH SHE'S READY TO RUN THIS COUNTRY.\n>> MAYOR, WE HAVE MORE TO DISCUSS, INCLUDING HILLARY\nCLINTON'S USE OF THE PHRASE \"BASKET OF DEPLORABLES.\"\nSTICK AROUND. WE'LL CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION\nRIGHT AFTER THIS QUICK BREAK.",

IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION\nBECAUSE WE KNOW SHE HAD PNEUMONIA IT IS EASY TO GET\nDEHYDRATED. WHETHER YOU ARE ACTUALLY\nFAINTING OR FAINTING IT IS BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GETTING\nENOUGH OXYGEN TO YOUR BRAIN. WITH A NEW MOAN YA' DIAGNOSIS,\nTHERE ARE A FEW FACTORS, MAYBE YOU ARE NOT EATING OR DRINKING\nAS MUCH. PLUS BEING SICK YOU BURN MORE\nFLUIDS, MORE CALORIES, YOUR METABOLISM GOES UP SO YOU CAN\nHAVE THAT EFFECT YOU.

COULD HER PNEUMONIA BE CONNECTED\nTO THE ISSUES SHE HAS HAD. >> SHE HAD A COUGH A COUPLE OF\nWEEKS BEFORE. THE PNEUMONIA IS NOT EASY TO\nDIAGNOSE IN THE BEGINNING BECAUSE IT DOES HAVE SYMPTOMS\nSIMILAR TO A COMMON COLD OR ALLERGIES.\nONCE THE DIAGNOSIS WAS MADE AND SHE HAD THE STUMBLING SHE HAD TO\nBRING IT OUT, BUT I UNDERSTAND WHY SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD POWER\nTHROUGH IT AND NOT TALK ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT WASN'T THAT BIG A\nDEAL TO HER OR HER DOCTORS. >> DONALD TRUMP RELEASED A FOUR\nPARAGRAPH LETTER WHERE HIS DOCTOR SAYS HE IS ASTONISHINGLY\nHEALTHY AND HE WOULD BE THE HEALTHIEST INDIVIDUAL ELECTED TO\nPRESIDENT.

I DON'T THINK THE LETTER SHOULD\nBE GIVEN CREDENCE AT ALL, BUT I AGREE A MEDICAL RECORD IS NOT\nTHE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING.

THEY SAID, OH, SHE WAS\nDEHYDRATED, SHE LEFT ON HER OWN ACCORD AND THEY SORT OF SEEMED\nTO SAY THAT EVERYTHING WAS FINE AND MAYBE EVERYTHING WAS FINE,\nBUT THE SORT OF SEVERITY OF THE SITUATION WAS ONLY REVEALED\nREALLY BECAUSE OF THAT VIDEO. >> AND HAD -- YOU KNOW, I ASKED\nHER ABOUT THIS WHEN SHE LEFT HER DAUGHTER'S APARTMENT, SHE SAID,\nYOU KNOW, I'M FEELING GREAT AND, YOU KNOW, I SORT OF CHALLENGED\nHER ON THAT TONIGHT, LIKE, YOU COULDN'T HAVE BEEN REALLY\nFEELING GREAT. SHE SAID ACTUALLY I WAS FEELING\nGREAT. IF SHE WAS FEELING GREAT, YOU\nTHINK SHE COULD HAVE GONE UP TO THE PROTECTIVE POOL AND SAID,\nYOU KNOW WHAT, I ACTUALLY GOT DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA ON\nFRIDAY BUT I WANTED TO POWER THROUGH IT AS OPPOSED TO KIND OF\nNOT UNTIL THE NEXT DAY. LATER THAT NIGHT.\n>> YOU CAN MAKE THE ARGUMENT, SOME OF HER SUPPORTERS HAVE,\nTHEY WANTED TO WAIT UNTIL SHE WAS CHECKED OUT AGAIN TO KNOW\nWHAT THEY WERE DEALING WITH, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, THEY HAVE\nBEEN THROUGH HEALTH ISSUES WITH HER IN THE PAST.\nOBVIOUSLY, WHAT HAPPENED IN 2012 WITH HER CONCUSSION WAS VERY\nDIFFERENT THAN WHAT APPEARS TO BE HAPPENING HERE.\nBUT THERE HAVE BEEN ISSUES BEFORE OF TRYING TO GET\nINFORMATION FROM PEOPLE AROUND CLINTON ABOUT HER HEALTH AND NOT\nALWAYS BEING MET PROMPTLY WITH IT.\nSO WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS, IF IT'S JUST PNEUMONIA, THERE ISN'T\nA REASON TO NOT REALLY JUST SAY UPFRONT, ESPECIALLY WHEN WHAT\nHER POINT IS CORRECT, YOU KNOW, SHE IS WORKING THROUGH THIS.\nWE'VE HAD -- ONE OF THE RULES OF A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN IS\nEVERYBODY GETS SICK. YOU ARE ON THESE PLANES, YOU ARE\nIN THESE BUBBLES. EVERYBODY GETS SICK.\nIT'S UNDERSTANDABLE. BUT IT'S HARDER TO SAY AFTER THE\nFACT, LOOK, SHE'S POWERING THROUGH THIS, WHEN THEY HAVE\nSORT OF MINIMIZED IT OVER MANY, MANY HOURS.\nIT WASN'T JUST 90 MINUTES. THE PNEUMONIA PIECE DIDN'T COME\nOUT UNTIL THE AFTERNOON. >> THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO WALK\nTHIS LINE BETWEEN FEEDING THESE CONSPIRACY THEORIES THAT ARE OUT\nTHERE AND PROVIDING MORE INFORMATION.\nBY ERRING ON THE SIDE OF NOT WANTING TO FEED THE CONSPIRACY\nTHEORIES THEY'VE MADE IT WORSE. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO\nACKNOWLEDGE, LOOK, WE DIDN'T DO THAT RIGHT BECAUSE THEY WERE\nAFRAID OF FEEDING THAT BEAST. EIGHT HOURS TRANSPIRED FROM THE\nTIME SHE GET INTO THAT VAN WITH ASSISTANCE TO THE TIME THEY PUT\nOUT THE PRESS RELEASE ON PNEUMONIA.\nTHAT IS A LONG TIME. >> THE VIDEO WAS SCARY LOOKING,\nTO ABBY'S POINT. THAT IS WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE WHEN\nYOU'RE FAINTING. WHEN ALL YOU'VE BEEN TOLD IN THE\nMORNING IS SHE OVERHEATED, LEFT AND FEELING MUCH BETTER NOW AND\nSEE THAT VIDEO, I THINK IT WAS JARRING FOR PEOPLE.\nI THINK THE VOTERS CARE ABOUT THE HEALTH OF PRESIDENTIAL\nNOMINEES. >> WE MAKE A LOT ABOUT THE\nTRANSPARENCY ISSUE IN RELATION TO THIS.\nOBVIOUSLY DONALD TRUMP ALSO HAS REAL QUESTIONS ABOUT\nTRANSPARENCY, TAX RETURNS BUT JUST, YOU KNOW, THE SAME\nPROTECTIVE POOL. ALL THAT SORT OF STUFF.\nI MEAN, YOU THINK BACK TO THE CONVENTION, YOU KNOW, WE HEARD\nMULTIPLE THINGS COMING OUT OF THE CAMPAIGN FOR, SOMETIMES IT\nWOULD GO ON FOR DAYS, CONFLICTING THINGS COMING OUT.\n>> HE DOESN'T HAVE A PROTECTIVE POOL.\nI WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS. THIS IS NOT A BOTH SIDES ISSUE.\nCLINTON'S CAMPAIGN IS MUCH MORE OPEN ON THIS IN TERMS OF THE\nPRESS. THEY BASICALLY HAVE A FULL\nPROTECTIVE POOL. NOT TOTALLY.\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN DOES NOT. THEY ARE TRYING TO WORK ON\nEXPANDING SOME OF THESE THINGS, BUT THEY ARE NOT THERE.\nTHIS IS A CAMPAIGN THAT HAD UNTIL RECENTLY BANNED NEWS\nOUTLETS. >> RIGHT.\nTHE \"WASHINGTON POST.\" >> INCLUDING THE \"WASHINGTON\nPOST.\" THIS SHOULD NOT BE TREATED LIKE\nIT'S ALL ON A CURVE WITH THIS. I KNOW WE SAY THAT A LOT ABOUT\nVARIOUS ISSUES WITH TRUMP. THERE IS SOMETHING TO THE FACT\nTHAT NEITHER OF THEM HAS DONE A FULL ACCOUNTING OF MEDICAL\nRECORDS, BUT HERS GENERALLY SPEAK ON DISCLOSURES ARE DEEPER.\n>> WE HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE. THANK YOU.\nDR. SANJAY GUPTA WILL LOOK BACK >>> THE BREAKING NEWS, HILLARY\nCLINTON SAYS SHE'S FEELING BETTER.\nSHE DIDN'T THINK HER PNEUMONIA DIAGNOSIS WAS THAT BIG A DEAL\nAND WANTED TO POWER THROUGH IT. I TALKED TO HER EARLIER THIS\nEVENING. SHE FELT DIZZY, LOST HER BALANCE\nFOR A MOMENT. HER DOCTOR RELEASED A STATEMENT\nSAYING CLINTON HAD BECOME DEHYDRATED.\nTODAY THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN SAID THEY'D RELEASE MORE MEDICAL\nINFORMATION ABOUT CLINTON IN THE NEXT DAYS.\nCHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT DR. SANJAY GUPTA REPORTS.\n>> Reporter: SHE DOESN'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IT BUT HILLARY\nCLINTON'S HEALTH HISTORY HAS BEEN UNDER SCRUTINY EVER SINCE\nSHE WAS FIRST LADY IN THE 1990s.\nIN 1998, SHE EXPERIENCED A DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS, A BLOOD CLOT IN\nHER RIGHT LEG. AT THE TIME, SHE DESCRIBED THE\nEXPERIENCE AS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT HEALTH SCARE SHE HAS\nEVER HAD. THE BIG CONCERN, BLOOD CLOTS,\nWHILE TREATABLE, CAN LEAD TO COMPLICATIONS, EVEN DEATH IF THE\nCLOT MOVES INTO THE LUNGS OR THE HEART.\nIN 2009, SHE HAD ANOTHER BLOOD CLOT, THE LOCATION STILL\nUNKNOWN, AND WAS NOT MADE PUBLIC UNTIL SHE LAUNCHED HER MOST\nRECENT BID FOR THE NOMINATION. CLINTON HAS BEEN ON BLOOD\nTHINNERS EVER SINCE. THAT SAME YEAR WELL EN ROUTE TO\nMEET WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA, CLINTON SLIPPED IN THE BASEMENT\nOF THE STATE DEPARTMENT FRACTURING HER RIGHT ELBOW AND\nREQUIRING SURGERY, BUT IT WAS A CONCUSSION IN DECEMBER 2012\nWHICH CLINTON SUSTAINED WHILE BATTLING A STOMACH VIRUS,\nFAINTING THEN FALLING IN HER HOME THAT CAUSED THE MOST\nCONCERN. PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON SAYING\nAFTER THE FACT HER RECOVERY TOOK SOME TIME.\n>> REQUIRED SIX MONTHS OF VERY SERIOUS WORK TO GET OVER.\n>> Reporter: THE GLASSES SHE WORE AFTER THE CONCUSSION FITTED\nWITH SPECIAL PRISM LENSES TO HELP CORRECT DOUBLE VISION GAVE\nSOME INDICATION AS TO HOW SERIOUS THE CONCUSSION WAS AND A\nSCAN TAKEN RIGHT AFTER THE CONCUSSION REVEALING YET ANOTHER\nBLOOD CLOT. THIS TIME IN BETWEEN HER SKULL\nAND THE BACK OF HER BRAIN. THE BIG CONCERN HERE IS THAT THE\nCLOT COULD PREVENT BLOOD FROM DRAINING PROPERLY FROM THE BRAIN\nCAUSING SWELLING AND POSSIBLY LEADING TO A STROKE.\nFOLLOW-UP EXAMS SUGGESTED NO LONG-TERM BRAIN INJURY AND THE\nCLOT EVENTUALLY DISSOLVED. JUST OVER A YEAR AGO, HER DOCTOR\nRELEASED A HEALTH CARE STATEMENT STATING IN PART THAT SHE'S IN\nEXCELLENT PHYSICAL CONDITION AND FIT TO SERVE AS PRESIDENT OF THE\nUNITED STATES. SHE OPENED UP ABOUT HER HEALTH\nTO ABC'S DIANE SAWYER IN 2014. >> HOW IS YOUR HEALTH?\n>> IT'S VERY GOOD, THANK YOU. >> HOW SERIOUS WAS IT?\n>> IT WAS, YOU KNOW, IT WAS, I THINK, A SERIOUS CONCUSSION.\n>> THE CLOT IN ADDITION -- >> YES.\n>> IF THE CLOT HAD DISLODGED -- >> WELL, CAN I TELL YOU, THAT\nWAS A SCARY POINT. >> YOU HAD TROUBLE WITH VISION.\n>> I HAD -- BECAUSE OF THE FORCE OF THE FALL, I HAD SOME -- I HAD\nDOUBLE VISION FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND I HAD SOME\nDIZZINESS. >> DID YOU HAVE TROUBLE TALKING?\n>> NO. I HAD NO PROBLEMS.\nTHE ONLY THING I HAD --",

ARE YOU SUGGESTING SHE DIDN'T\nHAVE PNEUMONIA OR SOMETHING WORSE?\n>> I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW.\nI JUST AM SAYING AS A GRANDMOTHER, I SAW THAT AND I\nTHOUGHT, YOU WOULD GO TO THE HOUSE WITH THE BABIES IN IT IF\nYOU HAD PNEUMONIA? IF I THINK I'VE GOT A COLD, I'M\nVERY CAREFUL ABOUT HOW I INTERACT WITH MY GRAND BABIES.\n>> ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S TAXES. IS IT TIME FOR HIM TO RELEASE\nHIS TAXES? >> WELL, TRUMP HAS FILED ALL OF\nHIS FINANCIAL PAPERWORK WITH THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION.\nTHAT'S A REQUIREMENT. HE'S MET EVERY DEADLINE THERE.\nI THINK IT IS FAIR TO SAY GIVE US SOME GENERAL OUTLINES SO THAT\nWE KNOW A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THAT.\nPEOPLE ARE CURIOUS ABOUT THAT. I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE THAT MR.\nTRUMP IS GOING TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION.\n>> TO RELEASE HIS TAXES. YOU HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE HE'LL\nRELEASE HIS TAXES? >> THERE ARE AUDITS GOING ON,\nBUT I THINK THE INFORMATION THAT PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT\nMORE ABOUT, I THINK THERE ARE WAYS TOO TO DO THAT AND THAT\nFINANCIAL DISCLOSURE IS ONE OF THOSE.\nI THINK THERE WILL BE OTHERS. >> JUST BECAUSE THIS CAME UP\nTHIS MORNING ON OUR SHOW, HOW DO YOU KNOW, IN FACT, THAT HE'S\nUNDER AN AUDIT? HE HASN'T EVEN RELEASED THE\nLETTER FROM THE IRS SAYING HE'S UNDER AN AUDIT.\n>> YEAH, I HEARD YOU ALL SAYING, TALKING ABOUT THAT.\nTHAT IS A QUESTION THAT PEOPLE HAVE.\nHOW EXTENSIVE IS THE AUDIT, HOW MANY YEARS?\nI DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT. I DO KNOW THAT MANY TIMES\nINDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SELF-EMPLOYED, SMALL BUSINESSES,\nINDIVIDUALS THAT OWN PRIVATELY HELD COMPANIES, THEY DO HAVE A\nTENDENCY TO FACE MORE AUDITS AND OF COURSE THE IRS COMMISSIONER\nAT THIS POINT IN TIME HAS BEEN A LITTLE LESS THAN FAIR.\nTHAT'S WHY THERE'S DISCUSSION ABOUT IMPEACHING THE IRS\nCOMMISSIONER. >> ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH THE\nLEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS PROVIDED FOR\nHIS FINANCIALS? >> SURE.\nI THINK YOU CAN GO LOOK AT HIS FEC FILINGS AND GET A GOOD\nPICTURE OF WHAT IS THERE. >> CONGRESSWOMAN DINGELL, IS\nHILLARY CLINTON NOW GOING TO RELEASE A MORE FULSOME PICTURE\nOF HER MEDICAL RECORDS? >> MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT\nSHE'S GOING TO BE RELEASING MORE THIS WEEK.\nI HOPE THAT DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO RELEASE MORE AND LET US\nSEE THOSE RECORDS. I WOULD SAY WITH ALL DUE RESPECT\nTO MY COLLEAGUE, WHO I REALLY LIKE WORKING FOR, I DON'T THINK\nWE'RE SEEING ANYTHING FROM THE DONALD TRUMP SIDE.\nWE DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS HOLDINGS ARE.\nWE DON'T KNOW WHO HE'S DOING BUSINESS WITH.\nIF HE'S COMPLETED AUDITS IN THE PAST, GIVE US A TAX RETURN FROM\nYEARS PAST SO WE CAN SEE WHAT IT WAS AT SOME POINT.\nLET'S TREAT BOTH CANDIDATES WITH THE SAME LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY.\nTHEY BOTH NEED TO GET IT. WE CARE ABOUT EVERYTHING IN\nTHEIR LIFE. WE NEED TO SEE EVERYTHING.\nI THINK YOU SEE ONE CANDIDATE BEING MUCH MORE FORTHCOMING IN\nRELEASING RECORDS THAN WE'VE SEEN THE OTHER SIDE.\nLET'S TREAT THEM TO BOTH EQUALLY.\n>> CONGRESSWOMAN DIRNGELL, ARE YOU SATISFIED DONALD TRUMP HAS\nGIVEN TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, AS MIKE PENCE SAID, TO\nCHARITY? BECAUSE WE'RE NOT SEEING\nEVIDENCE OF THAT. >> YOU KNOW, I THINK ALL OF US\nNEED TO GIVE AT THE LEVEL WE CAN AFFORD TO.\nI DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S GIVEN BECAUSE WE WON'T MAKE HIS TAX\nRETURNS PUBLIC. WE WON'T SHOW US WHAT HE'S DONE.\nI JUST THINK THAT'S WHY I'M SAYING IF HILLARY HADN'T MADE\nHERS, WE WOULD BE SCREAMING EQUALLY.\n>> HOW ABOUT THAT, CONGRESSWOMAN BLACKBURN?\n>> MANY TIMES PEOPLE LIKE GIVING MONEY ANONYMOUSLY.\nWE DON'T KNOW WHO MR. TRUMP HAS GIVEN TO.\nI THINK JUST KNOWING AND BEING AWARE HE HAS GIVEN THIS MONEY,\nHE HAS PARTICIPATED AND SUPPORTED CHARITIES, THAT'S A\nVERY GOOD THING. >> BUT WE DON'T KNOW IF HE'S\nGIVEN HIS OWN MONEY, ACTUALLY. >> SOME OF THE STORIES OF HIS\nGENEROSITY ARE OUT AND ABOUT, ALISYN.\nI THINK THAT MORE OF THOSE WILL BE COMING OUT OVER THE NEXT 56\nDAYS AS WE APPROACH ELECTION DAY.\nOF COURSE PEOPLE LIKE TO KNOW THAT CANDIDATES GIVE BACK.\nIT'S A GOOD THING TO GIVE BACK MORE THAN YOU TAKE.\nI THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT TO SEE LEADERSHIP THAT WILL\nBEGIN TO DO THAT. WASHINGTON IS PRIMARILY -- AND\nDEBBIE AND I HAVE SEEN THIS. PEOPLE THINK OF WASHINGTON AS A\nGREEDY TOWN WHERE PEOPLE ARE ALL ABOUT THEMSELVES AND CRONYISM\nRUNS RAMPANT. SO WHAT THEY WANT IN LEADERSHIP\nIS TO UNDERSTAND A FEW THINGS, THAT YOU DO GIVE THINGS BACK,\nYOU GIVE BACK MORE THAN YOU TAKE, LEAVE THINGS IN BETTER\nT SHAPE THAN YOU.\nFOUND THEM. >> SURE.\nTHEY ALSO SEEM TO WANT TRANSPARENCY SO THEY CAN KNOW\nHOW MUCH THEIR LEADERS HAVE GIVEN.\n>> YOU'RE RIGHT. >> TAX RETURNS, THEY COULD\nREVEAL HOW MUCH HE'S GIVEN TO CHARITY BECAUSE \"THE WASHINGTON\nPOST\" SAYS THAT IN THE PAST EIGHT YEARS THAT THEY STUDIED IN\nTHEIR INVESTIGATION, THEY CAN FIND ONLY $10,000 OUT OF HIS OWN\nPOCKET. WOULD THAT BE ENOUGH,\nCONGRESSW CONGRESSWOMAN BACKBURN?\n>> I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT \"THE WASHINGTON POST\" AND THEIR\nSTORY. LET'S LEAVE THIS TO THE C\nCAMPAIGN. THAT'S A QUESTION FOR THEM.\nI KNOW MR. TRUMP HAS BEEN VERY GENEROUS WITH HIS TIME AND HIS\nABILITIES, AS HAVE HIS CHILDREN. I KNOW THE CLINTON FOUNDATION\nHAS HAD A HISTORY OF NOT REPORTING FOREIGN CONTRIBUTIONS,\nOF NOT FILING 990s, OF SPENDING ONLY 13% OF WHAT THEY BRING IN.\n>> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THEIR OWN PERSONAL DONATIONS.\n>> THAT IS THEIR FOUNDATION. >> THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE\nTRUMP FOUNDATION AND WHAT THEY'VE GIVEN TO AS WELL. CONGRESSWOMAN, THANK YOU VERY\nMUCH FOR MAKING THE CASE. >> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.\n>> YOU TOO. THANK YOU FOR MAKING THE CASE\nFOR YOUR CANDIDATES. CHRIS?\n>> UP NEXT, A DOSE OF REALITY. THESE TWO CANDIDATES ARE TWO OF\nTHE OLDEST THAT WE'VE HAD. SO WHAT SHOULD BE THE STANDARD,\nNOT THE LAW, BECAUSE WE CAN'T GET ANY LAWS PASSED RIGHT NOW,\nBUT WHAT SHOULD BE THE STANDARD? WHAT SHOULD YOU KNOW ABOUT\nCANDIDATES AND THEIR HEALTH? WE HAVE AN EXPERT NEXT. >>> ALL RIGHT.\nTHE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE PRESSURE IS ON BOTH CANDIDATES\nTO RELEASE MORE INFORMATION,",

THERE ARE NO OTHER UNDISCLOSED\nCONDITIONS. THERE'S NOTHING THAT HAPPENED\nYESTERDAY THAT WAS CAUSED BY OR RELATED TO WHAT HAPPENED IN\n2012. >> HOW ARE YOU FEELING?\n>> NOW, THE CAMPAIGN IS SAYING THAT CLINTON IS GOING TO BE\nRELEASING MORE MEDICAL INFORMATION THIS WEEK, ERIN.\nIT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE AS BILL CLINTON IS GOING TO BE\nFILLING IN FOR HIS WIFE AT SOME OF THESE FUND-RAISERS, SHE IS\nTONIGHT GOING TO BE ADDRESSING DONORS VIA A TELECONFERENCE, SO\nTRYING TO KIND OF MAKE HER PRESENCE KNOWN.\nAND ALSO BILL CLINTON DID JUST SPEAK A SHORT TIME AGO TO\nCHARLIE ROSE IN AN INTERVIEW THAT'S GOING TO AIR IN ITS\nENTIRETY A LITTLE LATER. IN IT, HE ACTUALLY SAYS OVER THE\nYEARS ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION, HILLARY CLINTON HAS GOTTEN\nDEHYDRATED AS WE SAW YESTERDAY. AND HE SAYS THAT WHEN PRESSED,\nTHAT THIS WAS DEHYDRATION, NOTHING MORE.\nHE SAID IF IT'S MORE THAN THAT, IT'S NEWS TO HIM.\n>> ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, BRIANNA.\n\"OUTFRONT\" NOW DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT,\nPRACTICING NEUROSURGEON. DAVID GERGEN WHO SERVED AS\nADVISER TO FOUR PRESIDENTS, REAGAN AND CLINTON AMONG THEM.\nBRIANNA JUST REFERENCING WHAT I MENTIONED AT THE TOP OF THE\nSHOW, BILL CLINTON SAYING THIS HAD HAPPENED BEFORE.\nLET ME JUST PLAY FOR YOU EXACTLY HOW HE SAID IT IN THAT\nCONVERSATION WITH CHARLIE ROSE. >> WELL, IF IT IS, IT'S A\nMISTERY TO ME AND ALL OF HER DOCTORS.\nRARELY, MORE THAN ONE OCCASION OVER THE LAST MANY, MANY YEARS,\nTHE SAME SORT OF THING HAPPENED TO HER WHERE SHE GOT SEVERELY\nDEHYDRATED. SHE WORKED AS A DEMON AS YOU\nKNOW AS SECRETARY OF STATE AND AS A SENATOR AND IN THE YEARS\nSINCE. >> BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, SHE'S\nON A GRUELING CAMPAIGN. >> YEAH.\n>> AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE.\n>> I DO. >> SHE'S OLDER THAN YOU WERE\nWHEN YOU RAN. >> SHE HAD 2 1/2 HARD DAYS\nBEFORE THE DAY WHEN SHE GOT DIZZY.\nTODAY SHE MADE A DECISION, WHICH I THINK WAS CORRECT, TO CANCEL\nHER CAMPAIGN DAY. >> RIGHT.\n>> TO TAKE ONE MORE DAY TO REST. >> IS IT POSSIBLE SHE WILL BE\nAWAY FOR WEEKS FROM THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL?\n>> NO, NOT A SHOT. >> SANJAY, SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?\nI MEAN, OPERATIVE LINE THERE IS, OVER THE LAST MANY, MANY YEARS,\nTHE SAME SORT OF THING'S HAPPENED TO HER WHEN SHE GOT\nSEVERELY DEHYDRATED. SORT OF SAYING DON'T WORRY ABOUT\nIT BECAUSE IT'S HAPPENED BEFORE? >> I THINK THAT'S WHAT HE'S\nSAYING, SAYING, LOOK, IT'S NOT AS BIG A DEAL, THIS HAS HAPPENED\nBEFORE, SHE'S OBVIOUSLY RECOVERED.\nAT THE SAME TIME, HE'S SAYING, LOOK, THIS HAS HAPPENED BEFORE.\nTHE IMAGE PEOPLE ARE LEFT WITH OF HER TRYING TO GET INTO THAT\nVAN. THE FACT THAT THAT'S HAPPENED\nBEFORE IS PROBABLY NOT EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS TRYINGING  INING TO\nTHIS WASN'T AS BIG A DEAL I THINK AS PEOPLE MAY THINK.\n>> WHAT ELSE DO WE NEED TO KNOW? I'M SURE YOU HAVE A LOT OF\nQUESTIONS. ESPECIALLY NOW THAT HE'S COMING\nOUT AND SAYING THIS HAS HAPPENED BEFORE.\n>> THERE'S NOT A LOT OF INFORMATION HERE.\nTHAT'S THE STRIKING THING. SOMETIMES WITHIN MEDICINE, YOU\nKNOW, YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE GETTING INSIDE BASEBALL A LITTLE\nBIT BUT WE KNOW SHE HAS PNEUMONIA.\nWE FOUND THAT OUT TWO DAYS AFTER SHE WAS DIAGNOSED.\nWE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT TYPE OF PNEUMONIA SHE HAS.\nTHAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT CAN BE -- THERE'S PNEUMONIAS THEN\nTHERE ARE PNEUMONIAS, CAN BE MUCH MORE SERIOUS DEPENDING ON\nWHAT THE CAUSE OF THE PNEUMONIA IS.\nDID SHE HAVE A CHEST X-RAY? HOW MUCH OF HER LUNG IS ACTUALLY\nINVOLVED? FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON IS\nSAYING SHE'LL BE BACK IN A DAY BASED ON WHAT?\nBASED ON IS THERE SOME SORT OF MEDICAL CRITERIA FOR THAT?\nSHE'S BEING TREATED WITH AN ANTIBIOTIC.\nWHAT IS THIS ANTIBIOTIC? THOSE BECOME RELEVANT, ERIN,\nWHEN TRYING TO DETERMINE HOW SOMEONE IS GOING TO RECOVER,\nWHEN SHE'S GOING TO RECOVER. I HAVE NO DOUBT THIS IS\nTREATABLE. IT'S VERY TREATABLE.\nBUT THE REAL QUESTION IS HOW'S IT GOING TO BE TREATED, HOW LONG\nIS IT GOING TO TAKE? >> WHAT'S THE IMPACT, THEN, RON,\nOF THE INCIDENT, ITSELF, AND LOOK, YOU KNOW, JOIN GO THROUGH\nTHE HISTORY HERE, WE KNOW SHE'S HAD BLOOD CLOTS BEFORE THREE\nTIMES. BILL CLINTON WAS THE PERSON WHO\nCAME OUT LAST TIME AND OBVIOUSLY SAID IT TOOK HER SIX MONTHS TO\nRECOVER FROM ONE THAT WAS IN HER SKULL.\nTHE VIDEO, LOOK, IT'S STARTLING AND IT'S UPSETTING.\nOKAY? WE'VE ALL SEEN IT.\nI SORT OF WATCHED IT AGAIN AND AGAIN.\nYOUR HEART GOES OUT TO SOMEBODY. YOU THINK WHAT IS WRONG?\nTHIS IS SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO BE COMMANDER IN CHIEF.\nEVERY LEVEL, IT'S STARTLING. RON, DOES THIS EPISODE HURT HER\nWITH VOTERS. >> I THINK IF THIS IS IT, NOT\nMUCH, OR AT ALL, REALLY. IF SHE'S SICK, HAS PNEUMONIA,\nSHE GETS TREATED AND SHE'S BETTER, WE MOVE ON.\nIF THERE'S NR INDICATIONS OF ILL HEALTH AS THE CAMPAIGN GOES ON,\nTHIS RAISES THE STAKES. BILL CLINTON'S LANGUAGE IS VERY\nSTRANGE. THEY ARE ATTRIBUTING WHAT WE SAW\nTO PNEUMONIA. DEPENDING HOW YOU INTERPRET WHAT\nHE SAID, HE'S SAYING SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAS HAPPENED BEFORE.\nPRESUMABLY, SHE'S NOT HAD PNEUMONIA BEFORE.\nTHERE'S ANOTHER ROUND OF QUESTIONS BASED ON WHAT HE SAID.\nIF YOU HAVE ONE CANDIDATE, 69 ON ELECTION DAY, INAUGURATION DAY,\nANOTHER CANDIDATE WHO'S GOING TO BE 70 ON INAUGURATION DAY, THERE\nIS CLEARLY A NEED FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR HEALTH\nTHAN WE HAVE RECEIVED SO FAR. IF NOTHING ELSE, THIS IS GOING\nTO CATALYZE THAT. >> SANJAY, WHAT DO YOU SAY\nBEFORE I BRING IN -- SAYING IT HAPPENED BEFORE, PRESUMABLY NOT\nLINKED TO PNEUMONIA, DOES THAT RAISE MORE QUESTIONS\nNEUROLOGICALLY? >> THERE ARE DIFFERENT REASONS\nPEOPLE BECOME DEHYDRATED CLEARLY.\nRON BRINGS UP A GREAT POINT, THIS TIME IT WAS RELATED TO A\nM PNEUMONIA.\nSHE'S ON A THYROID MEDICATION.A YOUR BODY.\nTHERE ARE OTHER REASONS FOR IT. IT DIDN'T SEEM TO ANY THE FORMER\nPRESIDENT WAS SUGGESTING SHE'D HAD PNEUMONIA MANY TIMES.\n>> NO, NO. >> THIS IS A LITTLE UNCLEAR BY\nWHAT HE MEANT EXACTLY WHEN HE SAID THIS HAS HAPPENED BEFORE.\n>> RIGHT. >> DOES HE MEAN THE KIND OF, YOU\nKNOW, THE WOBBLY INCIDENT? >> RIGHT.\nEXACTLY WHAT IS IT THAT HAS HAPPENED BEFORE?\n>> RIGHT. WHAT IS IT?\nWE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THAT TOMORROW I GUESS.\n>> I'M SURE WE ARE. DAVID GERGEN, WHEN YOU PUT ALL\nTHIS IN CONTEXT, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP SAYING HE HAD HIS\nPHYSICAL, GOING TO PUT OUT THE DETAILED NUMBERS.\nHIS TESTS WERE FRIDAY. HE OBVIOUSLY NOW MUST DO THAT.\nRIGHT? THERE IS NO QUESTION.\nI MEAN, OBVIOUSLY BOTH OF THEM TO NEED TO DO IT.\nHE HAS TO DO IT WHATEVER THE RESULTS ARE.\n>> BOTH OF THEM ARE IN A RACE TO CLEAR THE RECORD.\n>> YEAH. >> THERE ARE REALLY TWO STORIES\nHERE WITH REGARD TO HILLARY CLINTON.\nONE IS THE STORY OF -- ABOUT HER PNEUMONIA, IS SHE GOING TO GET\nBACK ON HER FEET QUICKLY? WILL SHE BE BACK ON THE CAMPAIGN\nTRAIL? WHAT WILL WE SEE?\nTHERE'S THE SECOND BIGGER STORY, THAT IS, ARE WE GOING TO KNOW\nTHE TRUTH ABOUT HER LARGER MEDICAL SITUATION?\nAND WILL THEY BE GIVING -- THEY SAID THEY WERE GOING TO DISCLOSE\nSOME RECORDS NOW. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT RECORDS.\nI THINK THE NEXT BIG MILESTONE IS WHEN THEY RELEASE THOSE\nDOCUMENTS AND MAKE THEM AVAILABLE AND THEN WE CAN LISTEN\nTO SANJAY AND HE CAN TELL US, WE HAVE ENOUGH TO MAKE SERIOUS\nJUDGMENTS ABOUT HER OVERALL HEALTH OR WE DON'T.\nIF PEOPLE LIKE SANJAY CONCLUDE WE DON'T, SHE'S GOING TO HAVE A\nREAL SERIOUS POLITICAL PROBLEM EVEN THOUGH SHE MAY BY ALL\nAPPEARANCES LOOK GOOD. >> IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE I\nTHINK THE BIGGEST HEALTH ISSUE I THINK DAVID IS REFERRING TO\nPROBABLY DATES BACK TO 2012 AND THIS INJURY TO HER HEAD.\n>> THE CONCUSSION. >> THE CONCUSSION.\nA BRAIN INJURY. THAT ALSO LED TO THIS BLOOD\nCLOT, AS YOU MENTIONED, BETWEEN HER SKULL AND HER BRAIN.\nI MEAN, CERTAINLY SOMEONE WHO HAS A BRAIN INJURY LIKE THIS,\nYOU DO WORRY, IS IT GOING TO HAVE ANY LONG-TERM IMPACT?\nWHAT WE HEAR FROM HER DOCTORS, WHAT IS IN HER MEDICAL LETTERS,\nTHAT WAS TESTED A YEAR LATER, HER BRAIN FUNCTION WAS TESTED.\nEVERYTHING RETURNED TO NORMAL AND THAT THAT CLOT THAD R HAD R,\nA SUMMARY BASED ON THE DOCTOR'S INTERPRETATIONS.\nI THINK WHEN YOU RELEASE ALL THE MEDICAL RECORDS, REALLY DIVE\nINTO THIS AND SEE HOW DO THEY TEST THIS, WHAT DO THEY FIND,\nWHAT'S THE IMPACT? LIKELY IT'S GOING TO BE NOTHING\nBECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HER DOCTOR WHO KNOWS HER BEST TO THIS POINT\nHAS CONCLUDED. I THINK, YOU KNOW, BEING ABLE TO\nSEE THIS WILL BE IMPORTANT. >> WE KNOW LESS ABOUT DONALD\nTRUMP'S HEALTH AT THIS POINT. >> THAT'S RIGHT.\nOF COURSE, WE'LL SEE WHAT NUMBERS WE GET THIS WEEK.\nTHAT PROBABLY WILL ONLY JUST START TO ANSWER SOME OF THE\nSERIOUS QUESTIONS PEOPLE HAVE. THANK YOU, ALL.\n>>> NEXT, NEW QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TRUMP FOUNDATION.\nDID THE TRUMPS USE $20,000 OF",

IN MY OPINION.\nHER YALE LAW SCHOOL CLASSMATE WAS LANNIE DAVIS.\nHE WROTE A GREAT BOOK ABOUT CRISIS MANAGEMENT WITH THREE\nMANTRA IN IT, WHICH WAS TO SAY TELL IT EARLY, TELL IT ALL, AND\nTELL IT YOURSELF. SHE'S VIOLATED THAT CODA.\nI DON'T KNOW HOW SHE MADE IT THROUGH THAT INTERVIEW WITH\nCHRIS, BY THE WAY. BUT THEN TO SET UP THE SCENARIO\nWHERE ON FRIDAY WE ALL LEARNED THE DETAILS AND NOT UNTIL HOURS\nAFTER. SHE'S HER OWN WORST ENEMY IN\nCIRCUMSTANCES LIKE THIS. AND WHAT IT DOES IS REINFORCES\nTHE LIABILITIES THAT HER CAMPAIGN POSSESSES ABOUT LACK OF\nTRUSTWORTHINESS. BY THE WAY, ONE FINAL POINT.\nEVERYTHING SHE SAID TO ANDERSON LAST NIGHT ABOUT TRUMP IS TRUE.\nHE OUGHT TO RELEASE HIS TAXES. HE OUGHT TO RELEASE HIS HEALTH\nRECORDS. THEY BOTH SHOULD.\n>> SO WHY DOESN'T SHE GO THE FULL BERNSTEIN?\nWE HAD CARL BERNSTEIN ON THE SHOW.\nHE SAYS THE REMEDY FOR HILLARY AND WHAT WOULD HURT TRUMP THE\nMOST IS GO FULL TRANSPARENCY. HOLD THESE PRESS CONFERENCES OUT\nTHE WAZOO. GIVE THE SPEECHES FROM WALL\nSTREET. GIVE EVERYTHING AND SHOW THIS IS\nTHE KIND OF PRESIDENT I'LL BE. THE SUSPICION IS YOU CAN'T TRUST\nME. HERE.\nHERE'S EVERYTHING. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW, AND\nI'LL GIVE IT TO YOU. TRUMP WON'T.\nWHY DOESN'T SHE PLAY IT THAT WAY IF YOU'RE GOING TO ASK THEM TO\nDO IMPOSSIBLE THINGS? >> FIRST OF ALL, I LIKE CARL'S\nADVICE. I AGREE WITH IT.\nI THINK IT RUNS CONTRARY TO HER DNA AND PROBABLY TO HIS AS WELL,\nMEANING BILL'S. THEY REALLY ARE OF A MIND SET\nTHERE'S A VAST RIGHT-WING CONSPIRACY.\nPART OF THAT IS TRUE. THERE IS, BUT IT GETS FUELED BY\nTHE WAY IN WHICH THEY HANDLE THESE SORT OF CIRCUMSTANCES.\nI THINK THAT'S PROBABLY A BRILLIANT STRATEGY THAT SHE\nIMMEDIATELY NOW BE FORTHCOMING WITH EVERYTHING AND SHINE THE\nSPOTLIGHT BACK ON HIM. >> ALL RIGHT, MICHAEL.\nTHANKS. ALWAYS GREAT TO GET YOUR TAKE ON\nALL OF THIS. THANKS FOR BEING HERE.\n>> SO LET'S GO INTO THIS IDEA THAT MICHAEL WAS TEEING UP FOR\nUS HERE ABOUT THE TRANSPARENCY AND THE NATURE OF THESE\nCANDIDATES. LET'S LOOK AT IT IN THE CONTEXT\nOF HISTORY. THERE'S NO QUESTION THERE'S\nSTILL MAJOR QUESTIONS ABOUT BOTH TRUMP AND CLINTON.\nARE THEY GOING TO BE MORE OPEN AFTER THE SCRUTINY OF THIS WEEK?\nTWO OF THEIR SUPPORTERS FROM CONGRESS ARE GOING TO DEBATE\nWHETHER OR NOT THESE TWO ARE THE LEAST TRANSPARENT CANDIDATES\nWE'VE EVER HAD. >>> WELL, I JUST DIDN'T THINK IT\nWAS GOING TO BE THAT BIG A DEAL. COMPARE EVERYTHING YOU KNOW\nABOUT ME WITH MY OPPONENT. I THINK IT'S TIME HE MET THE\nSAME LEVEL OF DISCLOSURE THAT I HAVE FOR YEARS.\n>> QUESTIONS OF TRANSPARENCY PLAGUING BOTH CANDIDATES.\nHILLARY CLINTON UNDER FIRE FOR NOT DISCLOSING HER PNEUMONIA\nDIAGNOSIS WHILE DONALD TRUMP HAS REFUSED TO RELEASE ANY MEDICAL\nRECORDS OR TAX RETURNS. LET'S DEBATE THIS WITH TENNESSEE\nCONGRESSWOMAN MARSHA BLACKBURN AND DEBBIE DINGELL.\nGREAT TO SEE BOTH OF YOU. YOU'RE BOTH GOING TO MAKE YOUR\nCASE FOR YOUR CANDIDATE. CONGRESSWOMAN DINGELL, LET ME\nSTART WITH YOU. SHOULD HILLARY CLINTON HAVE\nDISCLOSED TO THE PRESS AND THE PUBLIC ON FRIDAY THAT SHE WAS\nDEALING WITH PNEUMONIA? >> SHE PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE IN\nRETROSPECT. I HOPE SHE REALIZES THAT.\nBUT I'M ALSO GOING TO SAY TO YOU, I THINK THAT WE'RE MAKING\nMUCH ADO ABOUT A LOT RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF HER ACTUAL HEALTH.\nI'M A WOMAN OF HER GENERATION, A FEW YEARS YOUNGER.\nI'M TELLING YOU THAT FOR MY ENTIRE CAREER, YOU POWER\nTHROUGH. IF I WAS SICK, I MEAN, I HAD\nMAJOR SURGERY AND WAS BACK AT WORK IN THREE OR FOUR DAYS\nBECAUSE THAT'S JUST WHAT YOU DO. AND, YOU KNOW, STEPPING UP INTO\nVANS, I TRIP GETTING INTO THE STOOL HERE THAT I'M SITTING IN\nBECAUSE IT'S HIGH. SO YES, SHE'S GOT TO JUST\nUNDERSTAND EVERYBODY'S MICROMANAGING WHAT HER HEALTH\nIS. BUT I ALSO WANT TO KNOW WHY\nWE'RE NOT SCREAMING AS LOUD ABOUT DONALD TRUMP.\nSHE HAS MADE MORE RECORDS AVAILABLE THAN ANY CANDIDATE IN\nHISTORY. WE DON'T KNOW DONALD TRUMP'S\nMEDICAL HISTORY. >> HOLD ON.\nSHE HASN'T MADE MORE MEDICAL RECORDS.\nI'M HOLDING WHAT SHE'S MADE AVAILABLE.\nIT'S TWO PAGES. EVERY ONE OF THE PREDECESSORS\nHAS MADE MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE MEDICAL RECORDS AVAILABLE THAN\nSHE HAS. >> SHE HAS OVER THE YEARS.\nNOW SHE GETS IT. SHE'S GOING TO BE RELEASING\nMORE. DONALD TRUMP'S WAS LIKE A\nNANOSECOND WORTH. AND NOT EVEN A REPORT ON WHAT\nHIS HEALTH REALLY IS. SO I THINK BOTH OF THEM NEED TO\nBE HELD TO THE SAME STANDARD. IF SHE SNEEZES, SHE NEEDS TO\nTELL US IT'S A SNEEZE OR AN ALLERGY OR WHATEVER IT IS.\n>> CONGRESSWOMAN BLACKBURN, LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS LETTER\nDONALD TRUMP RELEASED. ONE PAGE, FOUR PARAGRAPHS.\nHOW IS THIS TRANSPARENT? >> WELL, I THINK ONE OF THE\nTHINGS THAT YOU ARE SEEING IS THAT IN THIS DAY AND AGE,\nALISYN, PEOPLE ARE WANTING TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT\nARE ON THE BALLOT. THAT CAN BE A VERY GOOD THING.\nI UNDERSTAND THAT MR. TRUMP HAS SAID HE HAS RECENTLY HAD A\nMEDICAL EXAM AND IS GOING TO RELEASE THAT INFORMATION, BUT\nGOING BACK TO HILLARY CLINTON, I DO THINK WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS\nTHROUGH THE YEARS THERE HAS BEEN THIS PATTERN OF, IF YOU WILL, A\nDECEPTIVE ATTITUDE OF HIDING THINGS, WHETHER IT'S THE CLAINTN\nFOUNDATION OR THE E-MAILS AND WHAT TRANSPIRED THERE OR THE\nBENGHAZI SITUATION.

IS THAT OUT OF CONTROL?\n>> IT IS OUT OF CONTROL. BUT THE THING ABOUT IT IS THERE\nARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD ENOUGH TIME TO LISTEN TO BOTH\nCANDIDATES DISCUSS THEIR ISSUES AND HEARD THE CONTRADICTIONS TO\nTHE DISCUSSION TO THE POINT THAT PEOPLE HAVE MADE THEIR MINDS UP\nAS IT RELATES TO TRUSTING THEM FOR OVERALL HONESTY ON ONE SIDE\nOR THE OTHER. WHERE I THINK IT IS REALLY\nFRAGMENTED IS WE DON'T KNOW WHO THE TRUST, NOT JUST WHO BUT\nWHAT. BECAUSE WE HAVE SPENT SO MUCH\nTIME TALKING ABOUT THE PERSONALITIES AND NOT DELVING\nINTO THE POSSIBILITIES. I WOULD LIKE TO GET AWAY FROM\nTHE LARGER-THAN-LIFE PERSONALITIES RATHER THAN WHAT\nTHEY ARE GOING TO DO SPECIFICALLY.\nWE ARE GETTING SOME OF IT BUT NOT ENOUGH OF IT.\nAND THOSE OF US WHO UNDERSTAND WE NEED LEADERSHIP THAT IS\nPREPARED TO DEAL WITH THE KINDS OF CRISES WE JUST MEMORIALIZED\nON 9/11, WE REALLY WANT TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE\nTHEIR POLICIES, WHAT ARE THEIR LEADERSHIP SKILLS AND\nSPECIFICALLY WHAT LEVEL OF EXPERIENCE THEY BRING TO THE\nTABLE.

AND FROM MY VIEW, DONALD TRUMP\nSPEAKS FROM A CORPORATE LEVEL, A BUSINESS LEVEL, HE APPROACHES\nPOLITICS AS IF IT WERE AN ACQUISITION OF A PIECE OF\nPROPERTY. AND HE HAS A DIFFERENT RULE BOOK\nFROM HILLARY CLINTON WHO APPROACHES THIS LIKE A\nPOLITICIAN. AND THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT RULE\nBOOKS. AND I THINK IT HAS THROWN ALL OF\nUS OFF IN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE REALLY HANDLE THE\nNUANCES OF THE VERY UNIQUE SITUATION THAT I CAN'T REMEMBER,\nAT LEAST IN MY LIFETIME, IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY, WHERE\nWE CAN NOW GO BACK AND LOOK AT HOW SAY, FOR INSTANCE, DONALD\nTRUMP HAS VOTED AS A SENATOR OR IN THE PAST POLITICAL SYSTEM WE\nHAVE TO GO AND LOOK AT HIS RECORD AS A BUSINESS PERSON\nBECAUSE WE HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO GO ON.\nAND THEN TO LOOK AT HILLARY AND HER BACKGROUND AND HOW\nCONSISTENT SHE IS ON CERTAIN ISSUES AND INCONSISTENT ON\nOTHERS IS REALLY JUST A QUAGMIRE FOR WHICH WE ARE IN A VERY\nUNIQUE SITUATION.

              "text": ". .   IT'S A VERY SPECIFIC MOMENT,\n  THE LAUNCH WINDOW.   WE HAVE TO BE VERY PRECISE.  IF WE'RE NOT READY WHEN THE\n PLANETS ARE PERFECTLY ALIGNED,            THAT'S IT.      WE NEED REALLY TIGHT\n     TEMPERATURE CONTROLS.    ENGINEERING, AERODYNAMICS-     A SPLIT SECOND TOO LONG     COULD MEAN SCRAPPING IT\n    ALL AND STARTING OVER. PROPULSION, STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS-      MAPLE BOURBON CARAMEL.      THAT'S WHAT WE'RE\n     WORKING ON RIGHT NOW.  FROM DESIGN THROUGH PRODUCTION,\n SIEMENS TECHNOLOGY     HELPS MANUFACTURERS MEET\n    CRITICAL DEADLINES.      I THINK THIS'LL BE OUR\n     BIGGEST FLAVOR YET. WHEN YOU ONLY HAVE ONE SHOT, YOU\nNEED A WHOLE LOT OF INGENUITY. IS >> THAT WAS FAST.\n>> YES IT WAS. HILLARY'S CAMPAIGN SHOULD HAVE\nBEEN HONEST FROM THE GET-GO. THAT THIS EPISODES POINTS TO A\nLARGER QUESTION OF TRUST. >> I THINK THIS IS ANOTHER CASE\nOF THE COVER-UP BEING WORSE THAN THE CRIME.\nIF IT IS WHAT THEY SAY IT IS, THIS IS TOTALLY BENIGN, THEY\nSHOULD HAVE EXPLAINED IT RIGHT AWAY, AND THIS AS EVERYBODY CAN\nSEE, IT JUST ADDS TO THE IMPRESSION THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE\nSIMPLY INCAPABLE OF TELLING THE TRUTH, THE SIMPLE TRUTH.\nSANDRA: SO LET'S GO BACK, BILL, TO HILLARY CLINTON SAYING I JUST\nDIDN'T THINK IT WAS GOING TO BE THIS BIG OF A DEAL.\n>> I THINK SHE WANTED TO POWER THROUGH.\nI THINK SHE HAS BEEN PROBABLY DOING THAT FOR A LONG TIME.\nWE WITHIN OUR OWN JOBS WANT TO FIND STRENGTH TO GET THROUGH THE\nDALE. THIS IS REALLY GRUELING STUFF.\nMEGHAN, I WAS WITH YOUR FATHER EIGHT YEARS AGO IN\nNEW HAMPSHIRE, JUST TO SEE WHAT YOU DO, YOU REALLY GOT TO WANT\nIT. >> PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA.\nA SCHEDULE UNLIKE AN OLYMPIAN. GET UP IN THE MORNING, DON'T GET\nHOME UNTIL MIDNIGHT AND MEETING PEOPLE AT EVENTS ALL DAY.\n>> JOHN KERRY IN IOWA, 2004, HE HAD A GAP HE NEEDED TO CLOSE,\nRENTED A HELICOPTER AND FLEW ALL OVER THE STATE.\nHE HIMMED IN THERE SUNDAY NIGHT AND HIS VOICE WAS HOARSE AND HE\nWON. THAT IS SOMETHING YOU NEED TO\nDO. WITH REGARD TO HILLARY, SHE\nCOMES BACK AT THE END. WEEK, SHOWS STRENGTH, THIS WILL\nBEHIND HER. IF SHE COMES BACK AND THERE IS\nANOTHER EPISODE, IT COULD BE BIG.\nSANDRA: HOW DIFFERENT, LIZ, WOULD TODAY BE, IF CHARLES\nKRAUTHAMER SUGGESTED THEY SHOULD HAVE TOLD THE TRUTH FROM THE\nBEGINNING, IF IT WAS INDEED PNEUMONIA, THAT HER DOCTOR\nDIAGNOSED HER ON FRIDAY, HOW DIFFERENT WOULD TODAY BE IF THEY\nTOLD EVERYBODY THAT ON FRIDAY? >> REMEMBER.\nSHE WASN'T GOING TO A LOT OF CAMPAIGN EVENTS RECENTLY.\nTHEREFORE LETTING THIS NARRATIVE TAKE HOLD ABOUT THE EMAIL AND,\nSERVER IN THE BASEMENT OF THE HOME WITHOUT ANSWERING THE\nQUESTIONS ABOUT THAT. DID SHE LOSE SOME GROUND GAME TO\nTRUMP? POSSIBLY.\nSO INSTEAD OF TRANSPARENT, SAY I'M SICK, THEN VOTER, MEDIA SAY,\nSHE IS SICK, GIVE HER SOME LEEWAY ON IT.\nBUT ISSUE, WHAT IF THE SMARTPHONES WEREN'T THERE?\nWHAT IF NOBODY EVEN SAW THAT VIDEO AND KNEW ABOUT IT?\nWOULD WE KNOW SHE HAD PNEUMONIA NOW IF IT WASN'T THERE IF.\nSANDRA: THAT LEAVES ONLY ROOM FOR MORE SPECULATION AS\n\"NEW YORK POST\" COVER TODAY, THROW IT UP THERE, IT SAYS\nILLARY THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU LEAVE THAT MUCH ROOM FOR\nSPECULATION, RIGHT, HARRIS? >> WHAT IS INTERESTING OTHERS\nCOMING ON BOARD SAYING HOW SICK THEY HAVE BEEN.\nCHUCK SCHUMER RECENTLY HAD PNEUMONIA.\nNOT SAYING THAT HE FEELS FOR HER, NOT JUST HAVING EMPATHY, I\nWAS KIND OF IN THE SAME BOAT. THIS IS HOW YOU GET THROUGH IT\nAND HOW LONG IT TAKES. IT CAUSES PEOPLE TO COME TO HER\nSIDE. SO THEN I START TO QUESTION,\nWELL, IF YOU HAD TO CHANGE THE NARRATIVE FROM THE EMAILS AND\nYOU MIGHT BE SEEN AS A SYMPATHETIC FIGURE, WHY NOT EVEN\nTELL THEM YOU HAD PNEUMONIA ON FRIDAY?\nI GUESS SHE COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN THIS.\nSANDRA: THERE IS THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE MEDICAL\nRECORDS AND HOW MUCH HAS BEEN RELEASED, HOW MUCH MORE SHOULD\nBE RELEASED. HOW THOROUGH WE SHOULD LOOK AT\nTHEIR MEDICAL HISTORY. MEGHAN, HOW IMPORTANT, GOING\nBACK TO YOUR POINT ABOUT THE GRUELING SCHEDULE, YOU'RE\nTALKING ABOUT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.\nWHAT ABOUT ACTUALLY BEING PRESIDENT?\nHOW IMPORTANT IS IT FOR VOTERS TO SEE THE HEALTH OF THE\nCANDIDATE? >> I THINK HEALTH IS INCREDIBLY\nIMPORTANT IF YOU'RE NOT PHYSICALLY CAPABLE OF BEING\nPRESIDENT THIS IS SOMETHING THE AMERICAN VOTER SHOULD KNOW.\nTHIS BLOWS MY MIND TRUMP AND HILLARY HAVEN'T RELEASED MEDICAL\nRECORDS. THIS IS SOMETHING THE AMERICAN\nPUBLIC NEED TO KNOW. PIVOTING, OFF THIS, BILL, I\nTHINK IS MUCH BIGGER DEAL. COUGHING FIT.\nONE TIME LOOKING A LITTLE SICK IN THE DEBATES.\nSOMETIMES SHE LOOKS FATIGUED THREE HOURS THROUGH, THE\nAMERICAN PUBLIC WILL BE SHE IS NOT PHYSICALLY UP TO THIS.\nHARRIS: WE TALK ABOUT THE 55 DAYS UNTIL THE ELECTION.\nTHE NEXT BIG POINT, UNDER HOT LIGHTS FOR THE STAGE 90 MINUTES.\nINCREDIBLE PRESSURE. YOU'RE WITH DONALD TRUMP.\nDON'T KNOW WHICH DIRECTION. HE IS NOT TRADITIONAL TYPE OF\nCANDIDATE YOU WOULD HAVE DEBATED.\nSHE HASN'T EXPERIENCED WHAT THE 15, 16 OTHER GUYS EXPERIENCED.\nMEGHAN: ANOTHER QUESTION ABOUT THE CAPABILITY TO LEAD IS PEOPLE\nSURROUNDING HERSELF BY. IF THIS WERE MY FATHER ON THE\nCAMPAIGN AND HIS STAFF DIDN'T IMMEDIATELY TAKE HIM TO THE\nHOSPITAL. HARRIS: SOMEONE IS MISSING.\nHUMA ABEDIN. MEGHAN: DOESN'T MATTER.\nIF ONLY ONE WOMAN CAN HANDLE",
