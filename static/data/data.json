MY GOODNESS, HE'S HAD QUITE THE\nJOB AND I'M CURIOUS WHAT'S HIS REACTION WHEN YOU HAVE RUMP\nGOING OFF ON THE PARTY WHO NOMINATED HIM AND ON THE SPEAKER\nOF THE HOUSE AND DOING IN THE SUCH A PUBLIC FASHION, RANDY?\n>> I THINK HE'S TRYING TO GET THEM BOTH TO FOCUS ON HILLARY\nCLINTON. SHE HAS MADE THE CASE THAT\nDONALD TRUMP IS CRUDE, DONALD TRUMP AND PAUL RYAN HAVE TO MAKE\nTHE CASE THAT SHE'S CORRUPT. I THINK YOU'LL SEE THAT STEADY\nSTART WITH THE WIKILEAKS. YOU'LL SEE THIS STEADY DIET OF\nTHE LEAKS OF THE E-MAILS SHOWING FAVORITISM IN HAITI, SHOWING AN\nOPEN BORDER THROUGHOUT THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE.\n>> SO WILL HE LISTEN, THOUGH? WILL IT BE MORE ON HILLARY\nE-MAILS AND STOP IT WITH THE ATTACKS ON THESE REPUBLICANS?\n>> I'M NOT GOING TO PRETEND TO KNOW HOW DONALD TRUMP'S MIND\nWORKS. YOU AND I TALKED ABOUT IN THE\nTHE PRIMARIES, I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW HE WAS WINNING\nBUT I KNEW HE WAS WINNING. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE STRATEGY\nTODAY OR THIS PAST WEEKEND BUT I KNOW WHATEVER IT IS IT TENDS TO\nWORK AND HE TENDS TO WIN SO YOU DON'T MESS WITH A BATTER'S SWING\nIF THEY'RE HITTING THE BALL. >> QUICKLY, DO YOU THINK IF\nTHERE ARE ENOUGH DEFECTIONS DO YOU THINK PAUL RYAN'S JOB COULD\nBE ON THE LINE COME JANUARY IF YOU HOLD ON THE THE HOUSE?\n>> AS YOU KNOW, I WAS THE COUNCIL TO THE SPEAKERS OF 104th\nTO 109th CONGRESS AND, YOU KNOW, THE ROLL -- THE OFFICE OF THE\nSPEAKER IS ALWAYS AT PLAY. THERE WAS A COUP ATTEMPT AGAINST\nNEWT AND THERE WAS A -- CERTAINLY A LOT OF PRESSURE ON\nBOEHNER WHICH LED TO HIS RESIGNATION SO YOU'RE NEVER\nSECURE WHEN YOU'RE IN THE HAOFFE OF THE SPEAKER BECAUSE YOU HAVE\nSUCH A DIVERSITY OF OPINION AMONG YOUR CAUCUS MEMBERS SO I\nWOULD SAY HE WOULD BE ALWAYS IN JEOPARDY OF LOSING HIS JOB EVEN\nWITHOUT THE DONALD TRUMP FACTOR. >> REAL QUICKLY, I'M FROM\nGEORGIA, YOU'RE A GEORGIA BOY. I WAS CURIOUS TO READ POTE\nPOTENTIALLY WITH THE CLINTON CAMP FOCUSING THEIR ATTENTION ON\nGEORGIA AND ARIZONA, HOW REALISTIC IS IT, DO YOU THINK,\nTHAT THE DEMOCRATS COULD TURN BOTH OF THOSE STATES BLUE?\n>> COMPLETELY UNREALISTIC. WE HEARD THE SAME THING IN THE\nLAST CYCLE WHEN MICHELLE NUNN AND JASON CARTER AND THEIR\nFAMOUS PARENTS JIMMY CARTER AND SAM NUNN RAN.\nIT WAS GOING TO BE A PURPLE STATE, IT WAS GOING TO BE CLOSE.\nWE HAD AN ELECTION DAY, IT WASN'T COMPETITIVE.\nI DON'T THINK IT WILL BE COMPETITIVE THIS TIME, EITHER.\nJOHNNY ISAACSON WILL WIN BY AN OVERWHELMING MARGIN.\nDONALD TRUMP WILL CARRY GEORGIA. >> SINCE YOU SEEM TO SEE THE\nFUTURE. WHEN WE TALK FOUR MONTHS FROM\nNOW RANDY EVANS WHAT WILL WE BE TALKING ABOUT?\n>> I THINK WE'LL TALK ABOUT BASICALLY THE TRANSFORMATION\nINTO THREE POLITICAL PARTIES. I THINK WE'LL HAVE THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY, THE DEMOCRAT PARTY AND THE TRUMP PARTY AND I\nTHINK THE TRUMP PARTY WILL HAVE MANY THINGS IN COMMON WITH THE\nREPUBLICANS, IT'S GOING TO HAVE A FEW THINGS IN COMMON WITH\nDEMOCRATS BUT IT WILL BE A COALITION OF THOSE WHO WANT\nCHANGE FROM TOP TO BOTTOM AND UNFORTUNATELY IF YOU'RE AT THE\nTOP IN THE HOUSE OR THE SENATE AND CHANGE COMES, IT SOMETIMES\nCATCHES YOU UP IN IT. >> OKAY, WE'LL TALK IN FOUR\nMONTHS, HOPEFULLY BEFORE THEN, RANDY EVAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH.\n>> THANK YOU.",

WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT HILLARY\nCLINTON WOULD DO WITH IT UNLESS WE READ HER WEBSITE OR HER BOOK\nBECAUSE NOBODY ASKS HER.

I THINK DONALD TRUMP IS AT HIS\nBEST WHEN HE IS TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUES BECAUSE WE OWN THE\nISSUE SET. WE'RE VERY MUCH ON THE SIDE OF\nMOST AMERICANS ON THOSE ISSUES, WHICH IS WHY HILLARY CLINTON\nDOESN'T TALK ABOUT THEM. WHEN HE ATTACKS HILLARY\nCLINTON'S RECORD. THERE IS SO MUCH THERE, YOU\nCAN'T EVEN UNPACK IT ALL IN ONE CAMPAIGN.\nSHE HAS A TERRIBLE RECORD AS SECRETARY OF STATE.\nSHE OWNS LIBYA, BENGHAZI. SHE SHOULD OWN SYRIA, WHAT'S\nHAPPENING THERE. INCREDIBLY SAD TO ALL OF US\nREGARDLESS OF PARTY AFFILIATION. SHE OWNS THE RUSSIA RESET WHERE\nSHE DID THE GOOFY THING WALKING OVER AND HANDING SOMEBODY A\nDEVICE.

HE IS DOING A LOT TO HELP THERE\nBE ONE. >> BY ATTACKING THE SPEAKER OF\nTHE HOUSE? >> MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF\nDOLLARS. THAT MONEY GOES TO THE RNC --\n>> HOW IS ATTACKING THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE HELPFUL TO HIM --\n>> YOU KEEP SAYING HE IS ATTACKING THE SPEAKER OF THE\nHOUSE.

IS HE DONE ATTACKING THE HOUSE\nSPEAKER THEN? >> WHAT HE'S DOING IS WHAT HE'S\nALWAYS DONE, WHICH IS HE GIVES THESE LONG --\n>> YOU JUST SAID HE'S DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT.\nYOU ARE SAYING HE'S DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT FOR NOT\nAATTACKING THE SPEAKING. >> I CAN'T HEAR YOU.\n>> YOU SAID HE'S DOING WHAT HE ALWAYS DOES.\nYOU JUST SAID A THAT WHAT JIM ACOSTA REPORTED, WHICH WAS THAT\nHE DID NOT ATTACK PAUL RYAN AT THE SECOND OF TWO EVENTS TODAY,\nTO BE CLEAR, HE DID ATTACK PAUL RYAN AT THE EARLIER EVENT.\nSO WHAT I AM ASKING YOU, THEN, IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD\nEXPECT MORE OF? HAS HE FINISHED WITH ALL OF THE\nTWEETS AND THE COMMENTS ABOUT PAUL RYAN?\nIS HE NOW TURNING OFF THE SPIGOT ON THAT?\n>> THE SPIGOT? DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE THEME OF\nTHE FIRST SPEECH EVEN WAS? HAS CNN COVERED IT?\nIT HAD A THING. I BET YOU DON'T BECAUSE CNN\nDOESN'T COVER IT. IT'S DID HE ATTACK SOMEBODY?\nDID HE TWEET? YOU'RE DOING A DISSERVICE TO THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE BY NOT TELLING THEM EXACTLY EVERYTHING, FULLY\nAND FAIRLY, OF WHAT ONE OF THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ACTUALLY\nTHE ONLY ONE WHO GOES OUT AND TALKS TO VOTERS ON A DAILY BASIS\nABOUT ISSUES. >> YOU'RE NOT PUTTING WORDS IN\nHIS MOUTH, . >> WHAT DID HE TALK ABOUT TODAY?\nWHAT'S THE THEME OF HIS SPEECH TOMORROW.\n>> WHAT DID HE TALK ABOUT LAST WEEK.\nYOU CAN'T TELL ME BECAUSE HE DIDN'T COVER IT.\n>> HE UPSTAGES HIMSELF. HE UPSTAGES THE THEMES OF ALL OF\nHIS SPEECHES, ALMOST. >> NO.\nYOU CHERRY-PICK WHAT HE SAYS AND WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT FOR DAYS\nON END WITH A BREAKING NEWS CAPTION.\nI DON'T THINK IT QUALIFIES AS BREAKING NEWS TO TALK ABOUT THE\nSAME THING EVERY SINGLE HOUR. ON THIS ONE HE'LL DO WHAT HE HAS\nTO DO. I WOULD POINT OUT BREAKING NEWS\nTODAY, THAT YOU HAVE AT LEAST THREE UNITED STATES SENATORS AND\nA COUPLE OF CONGRESSMAN THAT WE KNOW ABOUT WHO NOW HAVE TAKEN\nBACK THEIR SORT OF I GUESS THEIR NON-ENDORSEMENT OR THEIR\nCRITICISM FROM OVER THE WEEKEND AND THEY'VE DECIDED THAT YOU\nCOULD STILL, AS I HAVE, AS MELANIA TRUMP, AS MIKE PENCE AND\nDONALD TRUMP HAS, CRITICIZED AND FIND REPREHENSIBLE WHAT DONALD\nTRUMP SAID IN THE VIDEO AND ACCEPT HIS APOLOGY AND STILL\nSUPPORT HIM. THE PEOPLE WHO SAID THEY WEREN'T\nGOING TO SUPPORT HIM NOW TURNED AROUND AND SAID THEY ARE.\nI GUESS THEY HEARD FROM THEIR VOTERS.\nTHAT THEY WANT THEM TO RUN AS A TICKET.\n>> WE'VE BEEN SAYING THAT THERE ARE FOLKS WHO, ON A CALL WITH\nHOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN TOOK ISSUE WITH THIS, THEY WANT HIM\nTO SUPPORT -- THEY WANT HIM TO SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP.\nTHEY'RE LOOKING AT THE POLL NUMBER THAT SHOWS A MAJORITY OF\nREPUBLICANS WANT THERE TO BE THAT SUPPORT OF DONALD TRUMP.\nWE HAVE REPORTED THAT. I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT\nTHAT. BUT WHEN YOU HAD DONALD TRUMP\nMAKING A PLAN TO APPEAR WITH PAUL RYAN IN WISCONSIN, JUST\nDAYS AGO, AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HE NOW SAYS HE IS A WEAK\nAND INEFFECTIVE LEADER, THAT HAPPENED AFTER HE DENOUNCED THIS\nVIDEOTAPE WHERE DONALD TRUMP WAS BRAGGING ABOUT GROPING WOMEN.\nWHY DOES HE -- >> MAKE SURE YOU GET THAT IN\nTHERE. >> I MEAN, I AM JUST REPORTING\nTHE FACTS OF IT. WHY IS IT NOT -- HOW IS THAT NOT\nJUST SORT OF SOUR GRAPES? >> HOW IS IT SOUR GRAPES?\nHE DIDN'T GO TO THE EVENT. ACTUALLY, HIS VICE PRESIDENTIAL\nRUNNING MATE DIDN'T GO TO THE EVENT.\nI GUESS THE CALCULATION WAS IF YOU'RE NOT WELCOME, I AM NOT\nWELCOME. LOOK, I WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH\nANOTHER WISCONSINITE, REINCE PRIEBUS, WHO IS THE HEAD OF THE\nRNC, AND WHO IS HELPING US MIGHTILY TO WIN THIS ELECTION.\nTHE RNC HAS BEEN GREAT TO US. THE CAMPAIGN AND THE RNC WORK\nVERY WELL TOGETHER. REINCE PRIEBUS AND PAUL RYAN ARE\nFRIENDS. I'VE CONSIDERED PAUL RYAN A\nFRIEND. I RESPECT HIM AS THE SPEAKER OF\nTHE HOUSE AND THAT HIS HOUSE MEMBERS HAVE ELECTED HIM AS\nSUCH. HE HAS MADE CLEAR THAT HIS JOB\nIS FRANKLY WHAT JOHN BOEHNER'S JOB WAS IN 2012 WHICH IS TO KEEP\nTHE HOUSE MAJORITY. I DON'T REMEMBER ANYBODY RUNNING\nANY STORIES -- WHY WOULD THEY -- THAT JOHN BOEHNER, THE SPEAKER\nOF THE HOUSE IN 2012 ISN'T ON THE PLANE OR BUS WITH MITT\nROMNEY EVERY DAY CAMPAIGNING. IT'S NOT WHAT THEY DO.\nTHEY GO AROUND AND THEY RAISE MONEY, AND THEY HELP TO SUPPORT,\nPROTECT THEIR MAJORITY, MAYBE INCREASE THEIR MAJORITY,\nPARTICULARLY THOSE MEMBERS, BRIANNA, WHO ARE IN TOUGH\nRE-ELECTION RACES AND THE OPEN SEATS THAT PERHAPS ARE THE FIRST\nOPPORTUNITIES IN MANY, MANY CYCLES TO WIN A REPUBLICAN SEAT.\nTHAT'S WHAT THE SPEAKERS OF THE HOUSE DO.\nI WILL REPEAT, THOUGH, DONALD TRUMP HAS NOT STOPPED RAISING\nMONEY. HE RAISED $5 MILLION PLUS\nYESTERDAY. SOME OF THAT MONEY GOES TO THE\nCOMMITTEES AND IT GOES TO THE COMMITTEES TO HELP THE\nDOWN-BALLOT RACES, OSTENSIBLY EVEN THOSE WHO AREN'T SUPPORTING\nHIM. >> STAY WITH ME.\nWE'LL TALK MORE AFTER A QUICK BREAK.\nRIGHT BACK WITH DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER.\nKELLYANNE CONWAY.",

DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER\nJUST NOW IN \"THE SITUATION ROOM\" DEFENDING HER BOSS' AGGRESSIVE\nATTACKS ON HILLARY CLINTON BUT DISMISSING HIS CONTINUING\nATTACKS ON HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN.\nI WANT TO BRING IN OUR POLITICAL EXPERTS.\nOKAY. FIRST I WANT TO TALK ABOUT\nSOMETHING DONALD TRUMP SAID TODAY, EARLIER TODAY.\nHE SAID \"SHE'S GOT TO GO TO JAIL\" ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON.\nHE HAD SAID IN THE DEBATE, WH HE SHE SAID, WELL, WE'RE LUCKY\nDONALD TRUMP ISN'T IN CHARGE OF THE LAWS IN THE COUNTRY.\nHE SAID, YOU KNOW, THAT YOU WOULD BE IN JAIL.\nKELLYANNE CONWAY HAS BEEN ARGUING THAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT\nTHE PROCESS. THEN SHE SEEMED TO ADMIT HE WAS\nTALKING ABOUT THE END RESULT. IT SEEMS LIKE HE IS TALKING\nABOUT A SUSPENSION OF LAW AND THAT, IF HE WERE PRESIDENT, SHE\nSHOULD BE IN JAIL. >> IT'S LIKE A BANANA REPUBLIC\nAS SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID. THAT'S NOT THE WAY OUR\nDEMOCRATIC SYSTEM WORKS. THERE IS A PEACEFUL TRANSITION\nOF POWER AND NO ROUNDING UP OF POLITICAL OPPONENTS.\nI THINK INITIALLY, IN TALKING TO SOME TRUMP SURROGATES, THEY\nSEEMED TO SUGGEST, OH, HE WAS JOKING.\nIT WAS A SARCASTIC THING HE SAID IN THE DEBATE.\nHERE HE'S DOUBLING DOWN AND ECHOING THE CRIES OF HIS\nSUPPORTERS WITH THE LOCKUP RALLYING CRY.\n>> HE IS NOT KIDDING. IT'S' BEEN SAYING THIS OVER AND\nOVER AGAIN. WHEN HE SAID IT ON THE DEBATE\nSTAGE IN FRONT OF 65 MILLION PEOPLE HE MEANT IT.\nHE SAID I'M GOING TO HAVE A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR.\nRUDY GIULIANI, HIS TOP SURROGATE WHO KNOWS SOMETHING ABOUT THE\nLAW SAID IT AS WELL. SO HE DID MEAN IT.\n>> AT THE RALLY TODAY HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE\nUNEQUIVOCAL. SHE HAS TO GO TO JAIL.\nTHE CROWD ATE IT UP. FOR KELLYANNE CONWAY TO COME ON\nAND SAY THAT HE SHOULDN'T BE TAKING THAT LITERALLY --\n>> IT SOUNDS VERY LITERAL. >> SHE IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE\nSTRAIGHT TALKER. IS HE NOT TALKING STRAIGHT?\n>> IT BRINGS UP THE QUESTION ABOUT HIS TEMPERAMENT.\nWE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS, REBECCA.\nIF HE IS TRYING TO PROVE TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS\nABOUT HIS TEMPERAMENT -- THE POLLS SHOW THAT -- WHY IS HE\nTALKING LIKE THAT. I ASKED KELLYANNE CONWAY ABOUT\nTHAT AND SHE SAID HILLARY CLINTON HAS PROBLEMS WITH THAT\nTOO. HE NEEDS TO WORK ON THIS.\n>> HAVING BEEN AT HIS RALLY IN THE PITTSBURGH AREA ON MONDAY.\nI SAW IT FIRSTHAND. THEY DO BELIEVE, AS TRUMP IS\nSAYING, THAT HILLARY CLINTON SHOULD BE IN JAIL.\nBUT FOR HIM TO BE USING HIS PLATFORM AS A PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATE TO BE SENDING THAT MESSAGE WHILE IT DOES ELECTRIFY\nMAYBE HIS CORE SUPPORTERS WHO WOULD BE VOTING FOR HIM IN THIS\nELECTION NO MATTER WHAT, IT'S NOT REASSURING PEOPLE WHO\nHAVEN'T DECIDED WHO THEY ARE VOTING FOR, AND IT ISN'T SENDING\nA GOOD MESSAGE ABOUT HIS TEMPERAMENT.\nWHAT WE ARE SEEING FROM DONALD TRUMP TIME AND AGAIN IS,\nWHENEVER SOMEONE UPSETS HIM, HE SEEKS RETRIBUTION ONE WAY OR\nANOTHER, EITHER VERBALLY OR A THREATENING ACTION LIKE THIS.\nWE'RE SEEING IT ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE NOW TOO.\n>> TOTALLY. EXACTLY.\nHE'S BEEN TAKING ON HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN.\nWHEN I BROUGHT IT UP WITH KELLYANNE CONWAY SHE SAID, WELL,\nHE DIDN'T JUST DO IT. MAYBE NOT AT THIS RALLY LATER IN\nTHE DAY. EARLIER IN THE DAY HE DID.\nI DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH CREDIT YOU GIVE SOMEONE FOR TALKING ABOUT\nSOMETHING EARLIER IN THE DAY AND THEN MAYBE NOT MENTIONING IT ONE\nTIME. WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND FOR\nDONALD TRUMP IS THAT, IF HE WERE TO WIN, HE WOULD NEED A\nREPUBLICAN CONGRESS. WHAT IS HE DOING THAT IS SO\nSELF-DESTRUCTIVE? >> IF THEY WERE TO WIN AND THE\nREPUBLICANS KEPT CONTROL OF THE CONGRESS, THEY WOULD FIGURE OUT\nA WAY TO WORK TOGETHER. PROBABLY BE MORE TRANSACTIONAL\nAND ALL THESE ATTACKS WOULD GO BY THE WAYSIDE.\nMAYBE. >> WHO KNOWS.\n>> YOU ASKED KELLYANNE CONWAY SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE\nCONFERENCE CALL THAT THEY HAD TODAY WITH TRUMP SUPPORTERS ON\nCAPITOL HILL WHO ACTUALLY EXPLICITLY SAID, YOU SHOULD --\nTHAT DONALD TRUMP SHOULD FOCUS ON HILLARY CLINTON.\nNOT PAUL RYAN. >> RIGHT.\n>> WHEN YOU ASKED HER ABOUT IT, SHE SIDE-STEPPED THAT AS WELL.\nNOT CLEAR IF SHE CAN CONTROL THE CANDIDATE.\nTHAT'S THE REAL ISSUE FOR KELLYANNE CONWAY.\nSHE MAY SAY HE'LL STOP ATTACKING PAUL RYAN.\n>> I ASKED HER IF SHE WAS THE END OF IT.\nSHE WOULDN'T SAY THAT. BECAUSE IT SEEMS SHE CAN'T\nGUARANTEE THAT. >> PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST\nCRINGE-WORTHY PARTS OF THE INTERVIEW IS WHEN WE RAN THE\nCLIPS OF THE FORMER MISS UNIVERSE AND TEEN PAGEANT\nFOLKS -- >> THAT HE WAS BASICALLY PEEPING\nON THEM IN VARIOUS STAGES OF UNDRESS.\n>> AND BRAGGED ABOUT IT. KELLYANNE, WE KNOW HER\nPERSONALLY. SHE IS A GOOD MOTHER AND HAS\nGOOD VALUES. SHE SAYS SHE CAN'T COMMENT ON\nWHAT THIS WOMAN IS SAYING. I WASN'T THERE TEEN YEARS AGO.\nI DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT ME TO SAY.\nWHAT THE WOMAN WAS SAYING WAS PRETTY GRAPHIC IN DETAIL.\nA REALLY TOUGH POSITION FOR HER TO BE IN OR ANYBODY, QUITE\nFRANKLY, WHO WORKS FOR A POLITICIAN THAT HAS SAID THINGS\nIN THE PAST THAT ARE SO DAMAGING AND DAMNING THAT TEN YEARS LATER\nTHEY STILL HAVE RADIOACTIVE RESONANCE.\n>> IT'S HARD TO DEFEND THE INDEFENSIBLE.\nTHANK YOU FOR BEING PART OF THE PANEL TODAY.\nI APPRECIATE IT.

WHAT ARE THEY SAYING ABOUT THIS\nWAR BETWEEN RYAN AND TRUMP? >> CONCERN ON BOTH SIDES.\nONE SIDE HOUSE RICEPUBLICANS BELIEVES RYAN ESSENTIALLY\nABANDONED TRUMP AT A TIME WHEN THE PARTY SHOULD BE UNITING.\nON THE CALL MONDAY -- IN THE WAKE OF THAT LEWD ACCESS\nHOLLYWOOD VIDEO. TODAY CONGRESSMAN JIM\nBRANDONSTEIN BECAME THE FIRST --.\nRYAN CAN'T AFFORD MANY DEFECTIONS IN ORDER TO KEEP THE\nSPEAKERS GAVEL. ON THE OTHER SIDE A NUMBER OF\nPRO TRUMP REPUBLICANS SIMPLY THINK DONALD TRUMP IS MAKING A\nMAJOR ERROR BY FOCUSING ALL OF HIS ATTACKS ON RYAN.\nTHEY TOLD KELLYANNE CONWAY HE SHOULD BE FOCUSES ON HILLARY\nCLINTON, NOT PAUL RYAN. >> TRUMP SUGGESTION THAT HOUSE\nSPEAKER RYAN IS INVOLVED IN A SINISTER DEAL COMES AS --.\nTHE HILL REPORTS THAT STEVE BANNON TOLD BRIGHT BART\nSTAFFERS, WHICH WAS THE CONSERVATIVE WEBSITE THAT HE\nUSED TO RUN. HE TOLD THEM, PAUL RHINE IS THE\nENEMY. IS HE BEHIND TRUMP'S\nANTI-ESTABLISHMENT WAR? SUNLAND SURFATI IS \"OUTFRONT.\"\n>> THERE IS A WHOLE SINISTER DEAL GOING ON.\n>> Reporter: DONALD TRUMP'S SCORCHED EARTH, TAKE NO\nPRISONERS STRATEGY AGAINST HIS OBSERVE PARTY.\n>> WE DON'T GET THE SUPPORT FROM GUYS LIKE PAUL RYAN.\nSO LOOK, I DON'T KNOW I DON'T WANT HIS SPORT.\nI DON'T CARE ABOUT HIS SUPPORT. >> SEEMS TO BE COVERED IN THE\nFINGERPRINTS OF THIS MAN STEVE BANNON WHO'S LONG TIME MISSION\nTO TARGET THE ESTABLISHMENT WING OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY MAY BE\nEGGING ON TRUMP'S ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT TEAR.\n>> THE SHACKLES ARE SOME OF THE ESTABLISHMENT PEOPLE THAT ARE\nWEAK AND IN EFFECTIVE PEOPLE WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY,\nSENATORS AND OTHERS AND PAUL RYAN LED TO A CERTAIN EXTENT BY\nPAUL RYAN -- >> Reporter: -- IN AUGUST FROM\nTHE FAR RIGHT CONSERVATIVE WEBSITE BRIGHT BART NEWS.\n>> WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS BITCH SLAP THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND\nGET THESE GUYS HEEDING TOO. AND IF WE HAVE TO WE'LL TAKE IT\nOVER. >> Reporter: A NO HOLDS BAR\nSTANCE OF HIS OWN. >> IF YOU ARE FIGHTING TO TAKE\nTHE COUNTRY BACK IT IS NOT GOING TO BE SUNSHINE PATRIOT.\nIT IS PEOPLE WHO WANT TO FIGHT. ANDREW BREITBART WAS ALL ABOUT\nTHE FIGHT. IN FACT WE CALL OURSELVES\nINTERNALLY THE FIGHT CLUB. >> TAKING AIM AT THE\nESTABLISHMENT WING OF THE PARTY. >> WE DON'T REALLY BELIEVE THERE\nIS A FUNCTIONAL CONSERVATIVE PARTY IN THE COUNTRY.\nWE CERTAINLY DON'T THINK THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THAT.\n>> BAN STEAMS TO HAVE BEEN ONING TO TAKE HIM DOWN FOR SOME TIME.\nE-MAILS OBTAINED BY THE HILL NUMBER SHOW BANNAN TELLING HIS\nBREITBART STAFF THE LONG GAME IS TO HAVE RYAN GONE BY SPRING.\nBREITBART PRODUCING HEAD LINES AGAINST RYAN OVER THE YEARS,\nDESPERATE, FAILING AND RUNNING SCARED.\nA FOE AND A FIGHT WHICH TRUMP IS TAGGING INTO THE RING NOW, EVEN\nSUGGESTING IF HE BECOMES PRESIDENT, RYAN'S SPEAKERSHIP\nMIGHT BE IN JEOPARDY. >> I WOULD THINK THAT RYAN MAYBE\nWOULDN'T BE THERE. MAYBE HE'LL BE IN A DIFFERENT\nPOSITION. >> AND THOSE ATTACKS ON PAUL\nRYAN IS SOMETHING TRUMP DID KEEP UP TODAY GOING AFTER RYAN BY\nNAME, BASHING RYAN FOR CRITIQUING HIM RATHER THAN\nPRAISING HIM AFTER LAST WEEK'S DEBATE.\n>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MY PANEL IS BACK WITH ME.\nNIA, TO YOU FIRST. WHAT TO YOU MAKE OF BANNAN'S\nSTRATEGY? >> IT IS NOT SURPRISING.\nIF YOU LOOK AT BREITBART THEY ALSO HAD AN ANTI-BOEHNER\nSTRATEGY AS WELL. AND WERE VERY MUCH THE VOICE OF\nCONSERVATIVES WHO DIDN'T LIKE THE ESTABLISHMENT.\nTHEY THOUGHT THE ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS WERE TOO POLITE THEY\nDIDN'T FIGHT IN A BARE KNUCKLED WAY AND DIDN'T GET ANYTHING DONE\nEVEN THOUGH THEY WERE VOICING OPPOSITION TO OBAMA THROUGHOUT\nTHE LAST EIGHT YEARS. SO YEAH, YOU HAVE THIS, I THINK\nTHE EMERGENCE OF A REAL, YOU KNOW -- A REAL PARTNERSHIP HERE\nON ONE HAND, YOU KNOW, DONALD TRUMP IN SOME WAYS ISN'T AS\nDISCIPLINED. HE'S ALL ID AND EMOTION AND THEN\nYOU HAVE IN BAN THIS PERSON WHO HAS A MEDIA PLATFORM WITH\nBREITBART. VERY MUCH KNOWS HOW TO PUNCH\nMESSAGES THROUGH. SO YOU HAVE THIS REAL DYNAMIC\nDUO. AND AGAIN HE'S BEEN AROUND\nCONSERVATIVE CIRCLES FOR YEARS. HE AT SOME POINT WAS WHISPERING\nINTO THE EAR OF SARAH PALIN WHEN SHE WAS AT HER MOST POWERFUL.\nSHE'S CONTINUING THAT SARAH PALIN LINE THROW DONALD TRUMP\nAND THIS COULD WORK. HE'S INFLICTING ALL SORTS OF\nDAMAGE ON PAUL RYAN WHO'S ANGLING IN MANY WAYS FOR 2020.\n>> YOU HAVE REPUBLICANS WHO CAME OUT OVER THE WEEKEND AND SAID\nTHEY COULDN'T VOTE FOR TRUMP AND SOME ARE COMING BACK.\n>> RIGHT. I DON'T UNDERSTAND.\n>> THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING TO TRUMP'S SIDES ON THIS.\nTHIS IS FAR FROM A DONE DEAL PAUL RYAN WILL WIN THIS.\n>> WHAT WE'RE WATCHING IS THE VENGEANCE OF THE NIHILISM.\nHE WANTS TO BURN EVERYTHING. WANTS TO DESTROY ALL THE\nINSTITUTIONS AND IF YOU COMPARE WHAT HE SAID IN TERMS OF RYAN\nBEING SIBSER AND LANGUAGE HE USED AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON IN\nTHE DEBATE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND.\nTHIS IS A DANGEROUS TIME IN POLITICS BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP'S\nBACK IS UP AGAINST THE WALL AND WHO KNOWS WHERE HE GOES FROM\nHERE. AND THAT IS REALLY SCARY.\nIF I WERE GOING TO BE UNSELFISH FOR A SECOND.\nI WOULD RATHER REPUBLICANS UNITE AGAINST HIM THAN BE ON THE\nFENCE. WE HAVE HAVE A DONALD TRUMP\nPRESIDENT I UNROLL ALL THE GAINS WE'VE MADE AND ROLL THEM BACK.\n>> WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT? IS THIS PAUL RYAN DOING A DEAL\nWHERE HILLARY CLINTON OR WHAT IS DONALD TRUMP INCINERATES.\n>> I THINK SEEMS THAT THERE ARE FOLKS ON THE HILL, ELECTED\nOFFICIALS THE BLISHLT WHO ARE ALIGNED AGAINST HIM.\nAND IT'S BEEN HAPPENING FROM DAY ONE WHEN THEY WERE TRYING TO\nKEEP HIM FROM 1237. THERE ARE FOLKS IN WASHINGTON\nDEAD SET AGAINST HIM BECAUSE HE'S AGAINST WASHINGTON.\nDONALD TRUMP IS ABOUT EMPOWERING THE PEOPLE AND PUSHING DOWN THE\nESTABLISHMENT COUNTRY CLUB ELITE IN BOTH PARTIES.\nTHAT SEEMS TO INCLUDE PAUL RYAN NOW.\nA LOT OF REPUBLICANS SITTING BACK CRITICIZING PAUL RYAN LONG\nBEFORE DONALD TRUMP CAME. >> SINISTER DEAL.\nWHAT DOES IT MEAN? >> I THINK WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT\nSTEVE BANNON AND OTHERS BELIEVE THAT PAUL RYAN AND HILLARY\nCLINTON ARE BOTH POLICY WONKS AND THEIR POLICIES ARE CLOSER\nTOGETHER THAN RYAN AND TRUMP. AND THAT HE BELIEVES THEY WOULD\nBE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER MORE EASILY THAN RYAN AND TRUMP.\nTHE OTHER THING ABOUT STEVE BANNON IS HE IS AS, YOU KNOW,\nWANTING DONALD TRUMP TO COME OUT HARD AGAINST HILLARY.\nSO HE'S HITTING RYAN AND HILLARY CLINTON.\nAND YOU SAW THAT IN THE DEBATE WHEN DONALD TRUMP CALLED HILLARY\nTHE DEVIL. AND THEN HE CALLED HER --\n>> CALLED HER HEART -- >> AND THAT'S THE PART OF THE\nPROBLEM. >> SO TIM WE'RE TALKING TONIGHT\nABOUT THE \"NEW YORK TIMES\" REPORTING, THE ALLEGATION OF TWO\nMORE WOMEN AGAINST DONALD TRUMP. THERE WAS A POLL THAT CAME OUT\nTODAY. HAD HIM AHEAD STILL IN MISSOURI.\nANOTHER POLL FROM WISCONSIN HAS CLINTON AHEAD BY SEVEN POINTS.\nOVER THE PAST FOUR DAYS, HE WAS AHEAD BY ONE POINT ON THURSDAY.\nBEFORE THE TAPE. AFTER THE TAPE ON FRIDAY CLINTON\nWAS AHEAD BY SIX. SATURDAY AND SUNDAY 19 POINTS.\nSETTLED THOUGH AT SEVEN. SO YOU COULD LOOK AT THAT EITHER\nWAY. HE'S DEAD OR HE'S COMING BACK.\n>> COUPLE OF THINGS. ONE THIS IS -- WHAT'S\nUNPRECEDENTED IS YOU HAVE A FRINGE ELEMENT IN AMERICAN\nPOLITICS WHO ARE CONTROLLING THE MESSAGING OF A MAJOR POLITICAL\nPARTY. WE HAVEN'T HAD ANYTHING CLOSE TO\nTHIS SINCE THE CPUSA, THE COMMUNIST PARTY IN THE UNITED\nSTATES IN 1948. THIS IS A FRINGE MOVEMENT\nDIRECTING THE MESSAGING OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\nBREITBART DOES NOT REPRESENT THE THINKING OF MOST CONSERVATIVES\nIN THE UNITED STATES. LET ALONE CENTRISTS AND OF\nCOURSE NOT LIBERALS. WHAT'S REMARKABLE HERE IS THERE\nIS NO THOUGHT TO GOVERNING. LET'S SAY HE WINS.\nHOW DO YOU GOVERN WITH AN ELECTION -- HOW DO YOU GOVERN\nWHEN YOU HAVE BASICALLY TORN DOWN ABSOLUTELY EVERYBODY IN\nYOUR PARTY WHO'S NOT SLAVISHLY COMMITTED TO YOU?\nTHAT IS THE CHALLENGE HERE. THAT IS WHY THE TEMPERAMENT TEST\nIS SO INTERESTING. THIS IS THE TIME FOR HIM TO FIND\nCOMMON CAUSE WITH RYAN. NOT THE TIME TO DESTROY THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY. >> -- OPPORTUNITIES TO DO --\n>> ALL OF YOU ARE GOING TO STAY WITH ME NEXT THE BREAKING NEWS\nOF TWO WOMEN COMING FORWARD TONIGHT SAYING DONALD TRUMP\nTOUCHED THEM INAPPROPRIATELY. THIS COMES AS CNN UNCOVERS MORE\nTAPES OF TRUMP BRAGGING ABOUT SEEING WOMEN NAKED AT BEAUTY\nPAGEANTS. WE'RE GOING TO PLAY THAT NEXT.\nAND TRUMP SUPPORTERS AND EVANGELICAL LEADER JERRY FALWELL\nJR. IS COMING OUT TO TALK ABOUT ALL THIS, TO ANSWER TO THESE\nTHINGS FOR DONALD TRUMP WHOM HE SUPPORTS.\nHE'LL BE MY GUEST NEXT. P",

LET'S BEAT HER.\nWE'VE GOT TO STOP IT. THERE'S WHOLE DEAL GOING ON\nTHERE, SO YOU KNOW, THERE'S WHOLE DEAL GOING ON AND WE'RE\nGOING TO FIGURE IT OUT. I ALWAYS FIGURE THINGS OUT.\nBUT THERE'S WHOLE SINISTER DEAL GOING ON.\n>> SO, JOHN, DOES HE HAVE A POINT?\nDO YOU AGREE THE PARTY'S INTENTIONALLY TRYING TO DAM AGE\nHIS CHANCES OF WINNING? >> NO, I THINK THAT'S\nRIDICULOUS. IN FACT, IF YOU LOOK AT THE\nCHAIRMAN OF THE PARTY, THERE WAS A SCHEDULED EVENT SATURDAY PAUL\nRYAN WAS GOING TO BE WITH DONALD TRUMP BEFORE THESE NEW REMARKS\nCAME OUT FRIDAY NIGHT, AND SO I JUST THINK IT'S UNFAIR TO ATTACK\nSOME OF THEM, I THINK THEY WANTED THE HELP, BUT I THINK\nTHEY SORT OF PUT THE PAUSE BUTTON ON AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND\nTHE STRATEGY. THE ONLY STRATEGY I CAN COME UP\nWITH IS TO SEND A MESSAGE TO CONGRESSMEN AND SENATORS AND\nCLOSE RACES THAT LOOK IF YOU DON'T ABANDON ME, OR MY\nFOLLOWERS WILL ABANDON YOU. THAT'S THE ONLY LOGIC FROM A\nPOLITICAL STANDPOINT OF THESE ATTACKS TODAY.\n>> DOUGLAS, IS THAT I'M GOING TO TAKE EVERYBODY DOWN WITH ME?\n>> YES, THAT WAS CLASSIC JOE MCCARTHY YOU JUST HEARD WHEN\nGOING AFTER EISENHOWER, TREASURING DWIGHT EISENHOWER,\nWHEN THE PARANOIA STARTS FILLING UP, EVERYBODY'S OUT TO GET YOU,\nAND YOU'RE WATCHING A SICK MELTDOWN OF DONALD TRUMP.\nHE'S GOING TO HAVE NOBODY LEFT TO SHOOTO AT ANYMORE, BUT I THIK\nHE SEEING HIMSELF AS GOING TO BECOME THE KING OF THE\nALTERNATIVE RIGHT AND ULTIMATELY, HE'S BEEN A\nTHIRD-PARTY CANDIDATE ALL ALONG, SO IF YOU'RE NOT WITH HIM,\nYOU'RE AGAINST HIM, AND IF YOU'RE NOT FULLY WITH HIM,\nYOU'RE AGAINST HIM AND THE FACT HE'S WILLING TO TOSS MCCAIN AND\nRYAN AND DENOUNCE THEM, HE'S DENOUNCED REPUBLICANS ALL YEAR\nLONG. I THINK IT'S JUST THE REPUBLICAN\nPARTY IS SICK OF HIM AND YOU'RE WATCHING PEOPLE DEFECT TO\nHILLARY CLINTON OR A THIRD-PARTY IN UTAH OR THE LIBERTARIAN\nPARTY, BUT TRUMP'S LOSING PEOPLE ALMOST ON AN HOURLYREBECCA, WHO\nNOW? IS IT DONALD TRUMP'S PART?\nIS IT PAUL RYAN'S PARTY? WHOSE IS IT?\n>> THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. IT IS REPUBLICAN PRIMARY VOTERS\nWHO ELEVATED DONALD TRUMP TO WIN THE NOMINATION AND SO HE IS THE\nLEADER OF THE PARTY RIGHT NOW, AND YET YOU STILL HAVE, IN TERMS\nOF PROFESSIONAL REPUBLICANS AND MODERATE REPUBLICAN VOTERS, THIS\nTUG IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION, SO IT'S REALLY NOT CLEAR WHAT IS\nGOING TO HAPPEN TO THE PARTY AFTER NOVEMBER, AND I KNOW\nALREADY MANY REPUBLICANS WITHIN THE PARTY ARE STARTING TO THINK\nTHROUGH WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE AND WHAT STEPS THEY'RE\nGOING TO NEED TO TAKE POTENTIALLY TO REBUILD IF DONALD\nTRUMP LOSES, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, YOU KNOW, THERE STILL IS A\nPOSSIBILITY THAT HE COULD WIN EVEN THOUGH BASED ON RECENT\nPOLLING, THE ODDS OF THAT HAVE DIMINISHED GREATLY AND IF HE\nWERE TO WIN, HE'S GOING AROUND INSULTING THE ALLIES HE WOULD\nNEED TO WORK WITHIN CONGRESS ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE AND IT\nDOESN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE FROM A STRATEGIC STANDPOINT IT.\nREALLY SUGGESTS TO ME AT LEAST DONALD TRUMP IS LAYING THE\nGROUNDWORK TO EXPLAIN HOW AND WHY HE LOST THIS ELECTION.\n>> OKAY. WHO AGREES WITH THAT?\nWAS THAT YOU, DOUGLAS? >> I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THAT.\nTHAT'S WHAT HE'S DOING RIGHT NOW.\nHE'S INCAPABLE. IT WILL BE THE ELITES, PAUL\nRYAN, JOHN MCCAIN, ANYBODY BUT HIMSELF, HIS OWN BOOFOONERY IS\nWHY HE LOST, BUT HE'S INCAPABLE OF RECOGNIZES HIS SHORT COMINGS.\nONE OF THE PROBLEMS OF TRUMP IS HE NEVER HAS A POLITICAL RECORD,\nAND HOW GREAT IT IS TO NOT HAVE ONE, BUT THESE SHOULD HAVE COME\nOUT YEARS AGO, BUT THEY'RE RAINING DOWN ON HIM SPECIAL IT'S\nALMOST PAINFUL TO WATCH HIM GO THROUGH THE LAST FEW WEEKS.\n>> REBECCA SAID THE ODDS ARE DIMINISHING.\nWHAT ARE THE ODDS WHEN IT COMES TO\nDONALD TRUMP? HE'S DEFIED THE ODDS.\n>> THE GREAT SAVIOR IS HILLARY CLINTON, WHO I THINK A LOT OF\nPEOPLE WOULD ARGUE IS MAYBE THE WORST CANDIDATE RUNNING FOR THE\nSECOND TIME IN THE HISTORY OF PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS WHO HAS\nHER OWN FAULTS AND PROBLEMS AND SCANDALS.\nTHAT IS THE ONE SAVING GRACE. THERE WAS A PENNSYLVANIA POLL\nTHAT SHOWED IT A FOUR POINT RACE IN WHAT REALLY IS A STATE THAT\nSHOULD BE STRONG DEMOCRAT.

              "text": "MAKE SURE EVERY PERSON WHO LIKES\nDONALD TRUMP SHOWS UP AT THE POLLS.\nTHERE IS LITTLE HOPE OF EXPANDING HIS TENT RIGHT NOW AND\nFINING A WAY TO REACH OUT TO MINORITY VOTERS AND MODERATE GOP\nVOTERS EVEN THOUGH CONSERVATIVE VOTERS AND OF COURSE WOMEN.\nRIGHT NOW THE BIGGEST SIGN OF WEAKNESS IS IN UTAH.\nHILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP IS TIED IN THE POLLS RIGHT NOW.\nTHIS IS DONALD TRUMP SHOWING THAT HE CANNOT HOLD ON TO\nPOTENTIALLY A VERY RED STATE. HE IS NOT ABLE TO DO THAT, IT'S\nHARD TO SEE HOW HE CAN WIN IN NOVEMBER.\nI'M NOT SURE IF HE CAN HEAR IT, BUTCHANTING CNN SUCKS\nABOUT TALKING ABOUT HOW HILLARY CLINTON COULDN'T GET ELECTED\nWITHOUT THE MEDIA. SAYING THE GOP IS UNDER MINING\nAND HIM AND FOLKS LIKE AND RYAN AND THE MEDIA IS UNDERMINING HIM\nAND REFUSING TO MITIGATE HIS MESSAGE AND HIS TONE AWAY FROM\nTHE PRIMARIES THAT WOULD HAVE SEEN MORE PEOPLE OVER AND DECIDE\nTHEY LIKE DONALD TRUMP. >> I DON'T WANT TO PUT THE CART\nBEFORE THE HORSE AND THE POLLS ARE THE POLLS.\nWHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF THIS MESSAGE AND DONALD\nTRUMP DELIVERING THE SUPPORTERS. IS HE SETTING HIMSELF UP FOR\nAFTER THE ELECTION IF HE LOSES? >> IF DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT WIN,\nARE THEY GOING TO STOKE THE IDEA THAT THE ELECTION WAS RIGGED AND\nTHERE WAS AN ESTABLISHMENT EXPERIENCE OUT TO TAKE DONALD\nTRUMP DOWN? THAT'S WHAT WE ARE HEARING AND\nNOT ALL OF THEM. A GOOD PORTION OF THEM THAT\nBELIEVE THIS IS RIG AND THERE MIGHT BE DEAD PEOPLE VOTING OR\nVOTER FRAUD IS AN ISSUE THEY KEEP BRINGING UP.\nIF HILLARY CLINTON WINS, GOVERNOR PENCE TOLD HER NOT TO\nSAY THAT. THERE WILL BE NO ACCEPTED OUT\nCOME OTHER THAN DONALD TRUMP WINNING.\n>> KATIE IS IN LAKELAND, FLORIDA.\nTHE DONALD TRUMP RALLY CONTINUES.\nAS KATIE WAS TALKING ABOUT, THE QUESTION IS\nARTHE MESSAGE HE IS DELIVERING ABOUT THAT WAR HE IS LOCKED IN\nWITH THE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP AND WHAT MESSAGE ARE HIS\nSUPPORTERS RECEIVING? IN SOME WAYS THEY ARE MORE FIRED\nUP THAN EVER IN THE WAKE OF WHAT HAS BEEN A TUMULTUOUS WEEK.\nSOME PROMISING TO REVOLT IF DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T WIN THE\nELECTION. THEY ARE PUTTING THAT IDEA TO\nMIKE PENCE LAST NIGHT. >> FOR ME PERSONALLY, IF HILLARY\nCLINTON GETS IN, I MYSELF, I'M READY FOR A REVOLUTION.\nWE CAN'T HAVE HER IN. I'M JUST SAYING IT.\n>> THERE IS A REVOLUTION COMING OUT.\n>> KELLY O'DONNELL IS ON THE TRAIL TALKING TO TRUMP\nSUPPORTERS. KELLY, THERE IS MIKE PENCE BEING\nCONFRONTED WITH THE IDEA OF FIGHTING THIS THING PAST\nNOVEMBER 8th IF WE LOSE. HE TRIES TO TAMP THAT DOWN, BUT\nIS THAT THE SPIRIT YOU ARE PICKING UP ON FROM TRUMP VOTERS?\n>> I CAN TELL YOU THERE IS THAT ANGER THAT HAS BEEN THE VOICE ON\nTHE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. ESPECIALLY WHEN IT AM CANS TO\nMIKE PENCE WHO IS DRAWN TO SEE HIM WHO IS PERPLEXED AND\nUNCOMFORTABLE WITH SOME OF WHAT IS GOING ON WITH DONALD TRUMP.\nFOR EXAMPLE, GOVERNOR PENCE AND HIS WIFE MAKING A STOP FOR\nLUNCH. ONE PERSON SHOUTING THAT DONALD\nTRUMP IS DESPICABLE AND ANOTHER URGING HIS RUNNING MATES TO\nFOCUS MORE. THIS IS THAT KIND OF ELECTION\nWHERE PEOPLE ARE CERTAINLY MORE VOCAL THAN IN CYCLES PAST,\nCHALLENGING THE CANDIDATES. THE LINE SEEMS TO HAVE MOVED\nQUITE A BIT WITH WHERE PEOPLE ARE COMFORTABLE.\nTHERE IS AN ANGER AND SOMETIMES EVEN DIRECTED AT THE FACT THAT\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS CRITICIZED FOR NOT BEING MORE EFFECTIVE AND\nTHEY WAGED THIS CAMPAIGN AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON FOR THOSE\nREPUBLICANS WHO BELIEVE THAT SHE COULD BE BEATABLE AND WOULD BE\nBEATABLE AND HAS NOT EARNED A PLACE TO SERVE.\nTHOSE WHO FEEL A REPUBLICAN SHOULD WIN.\nTHEY GET A CHANCE OF BOTH. THE REPUBLICANS WHO ARE\nUNCOMFORTABLE AND THOSE WHO ARE VOICING THAT ANGER THAT WAS\nEXPRESSED BY THAT WOMAN. INTERESTING TO ME THAT SOME OF\nPEOPLE THAT WE HEAR SHOUTING AT THESE EFFECTS IS A WOMAN'S VOICE\nWITH LOCK HER UP OR TRAITOR. THOSE ARE TWO INSTANCES WHERE I\nHEARD THAT WHICH MAY SURPRISE PEOPLE.\nIN ADDITION THAT, I HAVE MIKE PENCE TRYING TO ARGUE A MORE\nMUTED WAY TO SAY THAT REVOLUTION SHOULD BE THROUGH THE BALLOT AND\nNOT WANTING TO INSIGHT ANY OF THAT.\nAND ALSO THOSE WHO ARE UNEASY AND THE WHITE HOUSE WOULD BE\nBETTER TO REFLECT THAT WHEY WANT AND THEY SHOULD NOT FLINCH.\nKNOWING ALL THE CRITICISM. THE WAY HE CONDUCTED HIMSELF.\nAND INSTEAD FOCUSING ON THE ULTIMATE CHOICE.\nTHE CLINTON WHITE HOUSE AND A TRUMP-PENCE WHITE HOUSE, HE\nALWAYS INCLUDES HIS NAME AND TO SAY THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO WITH\nSTAND THE PRESSURE OF THE CRITICISM NOW.\nIT IS A COMPLICATED PICTURE FOR VOTERS FROM ANGER TO DISMAY.\nSTEVE? >> IN LYNCHBURG, VIRGINIA WHERE\nMIKE PENCE WAS. WE ARE GOING TO DIG DEEPER ON\nWHAT HAS BEEN THE STORY OF THE WEEK IN TERMS OF HIS OWN PARTY'S\nLEADERSHIP. THEY HAVE BEEN WITH HOUSE\nSPEAKER PAUL RYAN. ALL BUT UNENDORSING DONALD\nTRUMP. \"USA TODAY\" FOUND ONE QUARTER --\nTHAT'S THE WRONG GRAPHIC, BUT A QUARTER OF REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF\nCONGRESS REFUSED TO ENDORSE DONALD TRUMP.\nMORE THAN A QUARTER OF REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS\nAND GOVERNORS ARE NOT ENDORSING DONALD TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT.\nWHAT LOOKED LIKE A FULL-SCALE STAMPEDE FOR THE EXITS BY\nPANICKED REPUBLICANS, THAT NOW SEEMS TO HAVE SLOWED TO A HALT\nDUE TO THE DEBATE ON SUNDAY WHICH SEEMS TOED TO GO OVER\nWELL. YOU CAN SEE REPUBLICANS ARE\nRALLYING AROUND AFTER THAT DEBATE.\nTHEN THERE IS ALSO THIS. A NEW POLL THAT SHOWS DONALD\nTRUMP IS MUCH MORE POPULAR WITH REPUBLICAN VOTERS THAN PAUL\nRYAN. 74-26 FAVORABLE FOR TRUMP.\n54-31 FOR THE HOUSE SPEAKER. THIS IS THE PROBLEM FOR THE\nREPUBLICAN ELECTED OFFICIALS. MANY ARE PROFOUNDLY\nUNCOMFORTABLE WITH TRUMP. THAT IS CLEARLY NOT WIDESPREAD\nWHEN IT COMES TO ACTUAL REPUBLICAN VOTERS.\nTHE PEOPLE THAT REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS ULTIMATELY ANSWERED\nTO. WHAT WE ARE SEEING NOW, THE\nREPUBLICANS WHO BOLTED ON TRUMP ARE NOW STARTING TO COME BACK.\nREPUBLICAN SENATOR FROM NEBRASKA NOW SUPPORTS HIS DECISION TO\nSTAY IN THE RACE AND SAID SHE WILL VOTE FOR HIM.\nTHE REPUBLICAN OF THE YEN LEADERSHIP CALLED ON TRUMP TO\nGET OUT OVER THE WEEKEND AND NOW HE SAID HE IS STILL VOTING FOR\nTRUMP. MORE THAN EVER THE QUESTION\nLOOMS. WHOSE PARTY IS THIS?\nWE WILL BRING IN A FORMER REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN FROM\nMINNESOTA AND THANK YOU FOR TAKING A FEW MINUTES.\nLET ME START WITH THAT BASIC QUESTION WITH THE NUMBERS WE\nSHOWED. IS IT FAIR TO SAY THIS PARTY IS\nMUCH MORE DONALD TRUMP'S PARTY THAN PAUL RYAN'S PARTY?\n>> I HATE TO SAY IT, BUT I'M AFRAID THAT'S RIGHT.\nTRUMP WON FAIR AND SQUARE. HE DIDN'T GET A MAJORITY OF\nVOTES, BUT HE GOT MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE.\nWE SEE IN POLL AFTER POLL, SOME OF THE MORE OBNOXIOUS POSITIONS\nOF DONALD TRUMP ON TRADE AND IMMIGRATION ARE INDEED SUPPORTED\nBY A PLURALITY OR MAJORITY OF THE REPUBLICAN ELECTORATE.\nTHE NUMBERS ON PAUL RYAN I PUT IN A DIFFERENT CATEGORY.\nTHAT'S A REFLECTION OF PEOPLE DISGUSTED WITH CONGRESS AND A\nREFLECTION ON PAUL PERSONALLY. TRUMP WON THE NOMINATION AND HE\nRALLIED A LARGE AND GROWING FACTION WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN\nPARTY. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE HE\nBROADENED OUT AND IS ABLE TO APPEAL WHAT REPUBLICANS NEED TO\nAPPEAL TO IF THEY ARE EVER TO TAKE BACK THE WHITE HOUSE.\n>> LET ME RUN THROUGH THE SCENARIOS AFTER THE NOVEMBER\nELECTION. IF DONALD TRUMP COMES BACK AND\nWINS THIS ELECTION, HE SAID WHETHER IT'S PAUL RYAN OR JOHN\nMcCAIN OR ANY OF THE REPUBLICANS HE IS AT ODDS WITH, THEY WILL\nALL COME AROUND AND BE WITH HIM IF HE IS PRESIDENT.\nDO YOU THINK THAT'S RIGHT? >> IT'S NOT ENTIRELY.\nIT DEPENDS ON WHAT HE WANTS TO DO.\nPAUL RYAN AND HOUSE REPUBLICANS HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE LEGISLATIVE\nAGENDA ON NATIONAL SECURITY AND POVERTY AND ECONOMICS.\nTHEY WILL TRY TO DRIVE THE AGENDA AND EXPECT TRUMP TO\nACCEPT THEIR AGENDA. THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF THAT\nSHOULD HE BE ELECTED, BUT THE MORE CONTROVERSIAL THINGS HE\nTALKS ABOUT, DEPORTING 11 MILLION PEOPLE THAT ARE HERE\nWITHOUT PAPERS, BUILDING THE WALL, SOME OF HIS FOREIGN POLICY\nIDEAS, HE MAY HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT TIME GETTING\nREPUBLICANS AND CONGRESS TO GO ALONG WITH HIM.\nTHE TRADE DEALS ARE VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE.\nI DON'T THINK HE WILL GET FREE TRADERS TO GO ALONG WITH THE\nRADICAL CHANGE IN DIRECTION. >> HERE'S WHAT MAY BE THE MORE\nCOMPLICATED AND MORE LIKELY SCENARIO.\nIF DONALD TRUMP LOSES, ALL OF THOSE VOTERS WE SHOWED, THE\nREPUBLICAN VOTERS WHO ARE LOYAL TO HIM RIGHT NOW, WHAT DO YOU\nTHINK HAPPENED? DO YOU THINK THEY BLAME THE\nESTABLISHMENT FOR SABOTAGING THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN?\nWHAT WILL THAT DO TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IF HE LOSES?\n>> WE WILL HAVE A BIG FIGHT WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IF\nHE LOSES OR WINS TO. I EXPECT HIM TO LOSE AND THINK\nHE SHOULD LOSE AND I THINK WE WILL HAVE A BIG FIGHT IN THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU AVOID THAT.\nHE LAID OUT A VISION FOR THE COUNTRY THAT MOST REPUBLICANS\nCANNOT ACCEPT. THERE IS LOTS OF US.\nHIS PEOPLE ARE RALLIED TO HIS VISION OF AMERICA ON THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY. WE TALKED ABOUT THE PEOPLE AT\nTHE RALLIES CALLING FOR A REVOLUTION IN THE EVENT HE\nLOSES. I DON'T THINK THERE WILL BE A\nBLOODY REVOLUTION ON THE STREET. THAT WILL CONTINUE WITH THE\nFIGHT AFTER THE ELECTION. >> THIS STORY ONLY BEGINS ON\nNOVEMBER 8th. VIN WEBBER, THANKS FOR THE TIME.\nAPPRECIATE IT. WE HAD DONALD TRUMP SPEAKING A\nFEW MINUTES AGO AND NOW HILLARY CLINTON HAS JUST TAKEN THE STAGE\nIN PUEBLO, COLORADO. KRISTEN?\n>> Reporter: YOU CAN HEAR THE CROWD IS FIRED UP AND THEY ARE\nENERGIZED IN COMING TO THIS BATTLE GROUND STATE.\nTHEY GET THEM TO THE POST AND MAKE SURE THEY ARE REGISTERED TO\nVOTE. SHE IS GOING TO CONTRAST HER\nMESSAGE TODAY WITH SOMETHING THAT DONALD TRUMP IS DOING.\nHE WAS GOING TO TRY TO ARGUE THAT SHE WILL BE THE PRESIDENT\nFOR ALL AMERICANS. IN DOWN BALLOT RACES AND\nCONTRASTED HIMSELF TO OVER HERE, THEY RESPONDED TO CRITICISM WITH\nMORE PACKED E-MAILS WITH WIKILEAKS INCLUDING AN E-MAIL\nTHAT SEEMS TO SUGGEST SHE MADE DISPARAGING COMMENTS ON\nCATHOLICS. TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT SHE HAD TO\nSAY. >> YOUR E-MAIL ABOUT CATHOLICISM\nAND SOME OF THEM ARE SAYING YOU SHOULD STEP DOWN.\nDO YOU HAVE REACTION TO THAT? I'M A CATHOLIC.\n>> DON'T RECOGNIZE THAT E-MAIL. THIS IS LED BY THE RUSSIANS.\n>> WITH THE E-MAILS, POINTING THE FINGER AT RUSSIA.\nRUSSIA IS IN EFFECT TRYING TO DISTRACT FROM THE NEGATIVE\nHEADLINES. WITH THE CAMPAIGN NOW, SHE IS\nSKMEER IT HAS BEEN ALL OVER THE PLACE.\nTHE LATEST POLLS SHOW SHE IS UP AND SOME SHOW SHE IS UP BY\nDOUBLE-DIGITS. BACK TO YOU.\n>> AT THAT CLINTON RALLY IN PUEBLO.\nWE WILL LISTEN TO HER GOING THROUGH A THANK YOU OF DIFFERENT\nDIGNITARIES. WE WILL KEEP AN EYE ON IT.\nNEW POLLING IN THE LAST 24 HOURS SHOWS DONALD TRUMP AT RISK OF\nLOSING SOME DEEP RED STATES. HOW BAD IS IT GETTING FOR HIM?\nTHAT'S THE QUESTION. WE HAVE A NEW ROUND OF POLLING.\nWE WILL DO A TRIAGE OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.\n>> MY FOREFATHERS DIED TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO EXERCISE OUR VOTE.\nI WANT TO DO IT EARLY AND GET OUT OF THE WAY AND GET AS MANY\nPEOPLE DOWN HERE AS POSSIBLE. >> EARLY VOTING IS BIGGER AND\nBIGGER EVERY FOUR YEARS. IT IS ALREADY KICKING OFF TODAY\nIN THE MAJOR SWING STATE OF OHIO.\nWE WILL GO LIVE TO CLEVELAND WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN LINING UP\nTHROUGHOUT THE DAY. HOW MANY VOTES HAVE ALREADY BEEN\nCAST IN THIS ELECTION?",

OUR STORY BOOK ADVENTURE\nTONIGHT. WE'LL HAVE AN EVANGELICAL STORY\nAND TIME TRAVEL. TALKING ABOUT TIME TRAVEL IN\nTHREE STATES, UTAH, GEORGIA AND ARIZONA, THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE\nIS TRIPLING DOWN ON HIS WHOLE CROOKED HILLARY MOTOR EVEN.\nTODAY HE UNLEASHED A NEW AD ABOUT ALLEGED CORRUPTION IN\nCLINTON WORLD. TO SAY SHE ONLY CARES ABOUT\nMONEY, POWER AND HERSELF. TRUMP AND HIS TEAM HAVE BEEN\nHAMMERING AWAY ON THIS MESSAGE THE PAST 24 HOURS.\nTHE CANDIDATE HAS ALSO BEEN DIRECTING A STREAM OF EVEN MORE\nCRACKLING FIRE TOWARD HIS OWN PARTY AND SUGGESTING THAT A D.C.\nINSIDER'S CONSPIRACY IS AFOOT. >> THE SHACKLES ARE SOME OF THE\nESTABLISHMENT PEOPLE THAT ARE WEAK AND INEFFECTIVE PEOPLE\nWITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. SENATORS AND OTHERS AND PAUL\nRYAN. THEY DON'T GIVE THE SUPPORT THAT\nWE REALLY NEED. I THINK WE SHOULD GET SUPPORT\nAND WE DON'T GET SUPPORT FROM PAUL RYAN.\nHE HAD SUPPORT, WITH CONGRESSMEN, HUNDREDS OF THEM\nAND THEY PRACTICALLY RIOTED AGAINST HIM ON THE PHONE.\nONE PERSON STUCK UP FOR HIM. I'M TIRED OF NONSUPPORT.\n>> ALREADY THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE HAS A MASSIVE\nDISADVANTAGE. AND ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE THE\nLEADERS NOT PUTTING THEIR WEIGHT BEHIND THE PEOPLE.\nWOULDN'T YOU THINK THAT PAUL RYAN WOULD CALL AND SAY GOOD\nGOING? IN FRONT OF JUST ABOUT THE\nLARGEST AUDIENCE FOR SEEK NIGHT DEBATE IN THE HISTORY OF THE\nCOUNTRY. YOU THINK THEY WOULD SAY GREAT\nGOING, LET'S GO. LET'S BEAT THIS CROOK.\nSHE'S A CROOK.

YESTERDAY WE HAD A NICE LONG\nTALK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT HIS FIGHT WITH HIS OWN PARTY IS A\nSTRATEGY THAT WILL BE A WINNING ONE FOR HIM.\nTHE QUESTION I HAVE TO ASK YOU, WHAT DO YOU THINK THE\nIMPLICATIONS FOR THEM, IF TRUMP KEEPS GOING DOWN THIS PATH?\n>> I THINK THE IMPLICATIONS ARE SOWING THE SEEDS.\nA BITTER HARVEST. IF HE KEEPS GOING, 20 ODD DAYS\nBEFORE THE ELECTION. THERE WILL BE A MASSIVE AMOUNT\nOF FINGER POINTING. AND WHAT HE IS DOING NOW IS\nGOING TO EXACERBATE THE TENSION AND THE ACRIMONY TEN FOLD.\nYOU SAW AFTER MITT ROMNEY'S LOSS IN 2012.\nTHERE WERE DIVERGENT SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT.\nHE WASN'T CONSERVATIVE ENOUGH. HE DIDN'T HAVE THE BASE.\nWITH TRUMP, ONCE AGAIN THERE WILL BE LITIGATION.\nBECAUSE THE BREAK HAS HAPPENED BEFORE THE ELECTION.\nTHE NOTION THAT THE WAGONS CAN CIRCLE AND THERE CAN BE A SORT\nOF TRIBAL GATHERING THAT WILL RESULT IN A NEW RESHAPED, BETTER\nSTRONGER REPUBLICAN PARTY, THAT",

BECAUSE THEIR VIEW IS, AND THE\nPOLL ZPIRS STRATEGISTS AROUND THEM.\nIF HE IS TRASHING REPUBLICANS, IT WON'T HELP.\nBUT A LOT OF THESE VOTERS HEARING THIS.\nTHEIR ATTITUDE WILL BE, DO YOU KNOW WHAT?\nI'M NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR TRUMP. IF I'M NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR\nTRUMP, I'M GOING TO STAY HOME. ANY OF THESE OTHER REPUBLICAN\nSENATORS IN TOUGH RACES. SO THEY'RE WORRIED THAT TURNOUT.\nTHAT TRUMP WILL DRIVE AWAY THE VOTES THEY NEED ON WIN THEIR\nRACES. AND THAT IS CAUSING, WE'VE SEEN\nTHIS PANIC HAPPENING ALL WEEK. THAT'S A LARGE PART OF IT.\nNOT JUST THAT THEY'LL TO HAVE DEAL WITH THE CONTROVERSIAL\nSTATEMENTS BUT HE WILL HURT THEM BY DRIVING AWAY VOTERS, KEEPING\nTHEM HOME THAT THEY NEED. >> I WONDER WHAT THE CALCULATION\nIS COMING OUT WITH YOUR DISAVOWING.\nDOES THAT EVEN WIN YOU -- IT IS OCTOBER.\nTHEY'VE HAD MOMENTS LIKE THIS. FOR A REPUBLICAN VOTER, IS\nTAKING STAND AT THIS POINT IN TIME MEANINGFUL?\n>> THERE ARE 27 DAYS LEFT. WILL TRUMP DO OTHER THINGS THAT\nYOU'LL TO HAVE DEAL WITH? EITHER DISAVOW OR NOT.\nTHINGS COULD GET A LOT WORSE. >> HOW IS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY\nRESPONDING TO POST DEBATE TRUMP? WELL, IT'S COMPLICATED.\nAS YOU MAY RECALL OVER THE WEEKEND A NUMBER OF OFFICIALS\nPUBLICLY BROKE WITH THEIR PARTY'S NOMINEE AND SAID TRUMP\nSHOULD LEAVE THE TICKET. APPARENTLY SOME OF THEM HAVE HAD\nA CHANGE OF HEART. DAYS AGO THE THIRD RANKING\nREPUBLICAN IN THE SENATE, JOHN THUNE OF SOUTH DAKOTA, CALLED\nFOR TRUMP TO STEP ASIDE AND CALLED THE THINGS HE SAID ABOUT\nWOMEN IN 2005 MORE OFFENSIVE THAN ANYTHING I'VE EVER SEEN.\nAND YET TODAY -- THUNE SUGGESTED THAT HE WAS STILL GOING TO VOTE\nFOR TRUMP. TELLING RAPID CITY JOURNAL, I'M\nCERTAINLY NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nAND HE WASN'T THE ONLY ONE. NEBRASKA SENATOR DEBBY FISHER\nAND BRADLEY BURN ALSO REVERSED THEIR DISENDORSEMENTS OF TRUMP\nIN THE PAST 24 HOURS. OTHERS ARE STICKING TO THEIR\nGUNS FOR NOW. HAS HAS SENATORS LISA MURKOWSKI,\nTHE LATEST REPUBLICANS TO HURL THEMSELVES OFF THE TRUMP TRAIN\nGOING AS FAR AS QUIT GO THEIR POSITIONS IN THE STATE PARTY IN\nPROTEST OF THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE.\nALL RIGHT. SO OF ALL THE REPUBLICANS THAT\nNOW HAVE REANNOUNCED TRUMP, THERE IS A FORK IN THE ROAD.\nTO STAY AS SOMEONE WHO HAS NOT ENDORSED HIM, TO REENDORSE HIM.\nWHERE DO THEY GO FROM HERE IN. >> IT SEEMS LIKE THERE SHOULD BE\nA FORK IN THE ROAD. HE SAID THESE THINGS.\nHE SAID THIS IS DISGUSTING AND DISGRACEFUL, WHICH IT IS.\nAND I CAN NO LONGER TOLERATE ENDORSING DONALD TRUMP WILL I'M\nNOT GOING TO VOTE FOR HIM. HE HAS TO GET OFF THE TICKET.\nWHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST 72 TO 96 HOURS THAT MAKES YOU\nTHINK, ACTUALLY, I'M BACK WITH HIM AGAIN.\nTHEY ARE PROFILES HAD ANTI-COURAGE AND STUPIDITY.\nIT IS NOT JUST THAT THEY'RE BEING COWARDLY AND TIMID,\nTHEY'RE LOOKING LIKE GOONS. >> POLITICALLY CRAVEN.\nWHAT IS UNDER THE AUSPICES OF PRINCIPLED STAND CLEARLY BECOMES\nTRANSPARENTLY. THE IDEA THAT YOU WILL SAY THIS\nIS SO WRONG AND MORALLY REPREHENSIBLE AND THEN WITHIN\nTHE SAME WEEK, TURN AROUND AND SAY BUT I'M NOT RESCINDING MY\nENDORSEMENT. >> I THINK IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN.\n>> YOU THINK THEY'LL REUNENDORSE HIM?\n? >> WE DON'T KNOW IF HE WILL RISE\nIN THE POLLS. WE SAW HIM TAKE DIP OVER THE\nWEEKEND. THERE HAS BEEN SOME VERY LIMITED\nPOLLING DATA. IN THE MID TO HIGH 30s.\nIF HE STARTS TO CREAM UP TO 41, 43 AGAIN, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY\nHAS BEEN TOTALLY CRAVEN AROUND HIM ALL TOGETHER.\nI THINK THIS WILL BE PEOPLE, OH, YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO GET BACK\nWITH THIS GUY. >> FOREMOST, THE REPUBLICAN\nEVANGELICALS, CHRISTIAN CONSERVATIVES WHO ARE BEING\nFORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN VOTING AS THEY ALMOST ALWAYS DO FOR A\nREPUBLICAN CANDIDATE. AND ON THE OTHER HAND, SEEMING\nTO CONDONE DONALD TRUMP'S SCREAMINGLY HIGH PROFILE\nBEHAVIOR. SOME LIKE JERRY FALWELL JR. HAVE\nSTUCK BY THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE SO FAR SO DONALD TRUMP'S RUNNING\nMATE WAS IN FRIENDLY TERRITORY WHEN HE VISITED THE UNIVERSITY'S\nCAMPUS AND SAID HE SHOULD BE ABSOLVED OF HIS PAST PROBLEMS.\n>> I WAS ASKED HOW I AS A CHRISTIAN COULD MOVE BEYOND\nTHOSE MOMENTS AND ACCEPT AN APOLOGY.\nAND I WAS HAPPY TO EXPLAIN THAT TO THE TELEVISION HOST.\nYOU SAID, AS BELIEVER, WE'RE CALL TO ASPIRE TO LIVE GODLY\nLIVES. BUT ALSO, WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE\nALL FALL SHORT. IT IS NOT ABOUT CONDONING WHAT\nIS SAID AND DONE. IT IS ABOUT BELIEVING IN GRACE\nAND FORGIVENESS. WE ARE CALLED TO FORGIVE.\n>> SO NOT ALL EVANGELICALS AGREE MIKE PENCE' SENTIMENT.\nCHRISTIAN MAGAZINE WROTE THAT SEXUAL IMMORALITY, LUST, EVIL\nDESIRES AND GREED ARE AN INCREDIBLY APT SUMMARY OF DONALD\nTRUMP'S LIFE TO DATE. HE IS AN EYE DOLLTER IN MANY\nWAYS. HE HAS GIVEN NO EVIDENCE OF\nHUMILITY. HE WANTONLY CELEBRATES STRONGMEN\nAND TAKES EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO HUMILIATE AND DEMEAN THE\nVULNERABLE. NECESSARY SHORT THE VERY\nEMBODYMENT OF WHAT THE BIBLE CALLS A FOOL.\n>> BUT WHAT DO YOU REALLY THINK? >> THAT IS A SERIOUSLY HARSH\nATTACK. CHRISTIANITY TODAY.\nWHO KNEW THEY COULD THROW HEAT QUITE THAT WAY?\nSO EVANGELICALS, ALMOST ALWAYS REPUBLICANS ON ELECTION DAY,\nWHAT WILL THE STORY BE? WILL TRUMP HAVE THE NORMAL\nEVANGELICAL TURNOUT? >> I THINK HE WILL LOSE A LOT OF\nEVANGELICAL WOMEN IN THE SAME WAY THAT HE WILL LOSE A LOT OF\nWOMEN OVERALL OF I THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME EVANGELICALS WHO\nWILL STICK WITH HIM ON THE SINGULAR BASIS OF THE SUPREME\nCOURT AND THEIR DESIRE TO SEE ROW V. WADE OVERTURNED.\nIT IS A FLAG PLANTING ISSUE THAT THEY WILL, I GUESS, STOMACH THAT\nREST IT. AND PULL THE LEVER FOR TRUMP.\nTHIS WAS A REPUBLICAN ON TELEVISION LAST NIGHT ASKING, IF\nHE CAME OUT AND ANNOUNCED THAT HE ENJOYED RAPE.\nAND THE CONGRESSMAN, I DON'T REMEMBER WHICH ONE IT WAS.\nHE SAID I HAVE TO THINK THAT OVER.\nI FIND IT INCREDIBLY PUZZLING. I UNDERSTAND THAT CHRISTIAN\nCONSERVATIVES CARE A LOT ABOUT THE SUPREME COURT AND ROE V.\nWADE TO TRY TO END ABORTION ENTIRELY.\nBUT I FIND IT AMAZING HOW MANY OF THEM HEAR WHAT TRUMP HAS SAID\nAND ADMITTED AND BOASTED ABOUT, AND SEEMED TO HAVE ALMOST NO\nCARE FOR IT WHATSOEVER. SEEM TO PRETEND THAT NECESSARY\nSOME WAY GENUINELY SOUGHT FORGIVENESS AND GRACE.\nI FIND IT INCREDIBLY WEIRD THAT THEY DON'T EVEN SEEM TO BE\nSTRUGGLING WITH THE MORAL IMPLICATIONS OF BACKING THIS GUY\nWHO HAS DONE SO MANY THINGS THAT ACCORDING TO THEIR THEOLOGY ARE\nJUST SINFUL. >> WELL, THE INVOCATION OF FAITH\nIS STRONG IN THE CHRISTIAN FAITH.\nWE WILL DISCUSS HOW THE CHRISTIAN CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN\nRESPONDING TO THESE DISCLOSURES WHEN WE COME RIGHT BACK.",

PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT IS\nHIS POINT? HILLARY CLINTON IS PART OF A\nCORRUPT CULTURE. I DON'T RECALLING HIM DOING THAT\nWITH ANYTHING. EVEN IN THE DEBATE I THOUGHT HE\nWAS TOO SPECIFIC AND CONCRETE. >> I THINK WITH WIKILEAKS, HE\nHAS SOME CONCRETE EVIDENCE OF THE NARRATIVE THAT HE IS TRYING\nTO PUSH FORWARD. THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS WORKING\nBEHIND THE SCENES. NOT IN YOUR BEST INTERESTS BUT\nHER OWN. SHE IS SOMEBODY OVER HUNGRY FOR\nPOWER, FOR THE PRESIDENCY. HE GOT IT A LITTLE MORE, HE HIT\nIT A LITTLE HARDER BUT HE IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH IT AT ALL.\nAND HE SAYS IT SO SPORADICALLY THAT IT DOESN'T ALLOW THE\nMIDEAST TO SAY, HEY, HERE'S THE MESSAGE THAT DONALD TRUMP IS\nGOING ON. INSTEAD, HE IS TALKING -- THE IT\nDOESN'T DO ANYTHING TO GET HIM THE ATTENTION IN THE NATIONAL\nMEDIA THAT HE IS LOOKING FOR. HE IS CONSTANTLY DOING AND\nSAYING THINGS THAT DISTRACT FROM THAT MESSAGE.\n>> YOU MENTION WILL EARLIER, THAT THEY ARE MORE UPLIFTED AND\nEARLY ON. MY SENSE IS FROM WATCHING.\n>> ALL RIGHT. SO IT LOOKS LIKE WE'VE LOST MARK\nAND KATY. MAYBE THAT THUNDERSTORM WAS MORE\nSEVERE THAN WE THOUGHT. THOSE WITH ARE HAVING THIS\nDISCUSSION ABOUT HOW THIS IS PAYING OUT.\nREALLY DISARRAY. IT LOOKED LIKE THE POSSIBILITY\nTHAT THE PARTY WOULD WHOLESALE ABANDON TRUMP.\nNOW YOU HAVE VERY DISTINCT FACTIONS ALL TRYING TO FIGURE\nOUT, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO HERE?\nWHAT ARE THE RISKS? WHAT ARE THE TRAPS?\n>> YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A CANDIDATE WHO HAS BEEN VERY\nUNDISCIPLINED. GIVEN THAT THE WIKILEAKS CAME\nOUT ON FRIDAY IN A FORTUITOUS BIT OF TIMING.\nTHIS COULD BE THE WEEK WHERE THERE IS MUCH MORE EXPLANATION\nABOUT THE PRECISE CONTENT OF WIKILEAKS AND INSTEAD, WE'RE\nTALKING ABOUT INFIGHTING IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\nTHERE WAS NO NEED FOR THIS TO HAPPEN.\nONE WONDERS WHAT THE RELATIONSHIP IS BETWEEN PAUL\nRYAN AND DONALD TRUMP IS. WHERE RYAN COULD HAVE BEEN\nBROUGHT BACK FROM THE LEDGE IF THERE HAD BEEN A PHONE CALL.\nI DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT RELATIONSHIP IS LIKE AND WHETHER\nIT IS BEYOND REPAIR. THEIR A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THAT\nTRUMP UNDERSTANDS WHY HE IS GOING TO LOSE AND IF HE IS\nSETTING UP FOR A MEDIA EMPIRE. IF YOU THINK ABOUT HIM TALKING\nABOUT THE ELECTION BEING STOLEN, HIM BLAMING THE MEDIA AND THE\nREPUBLICAN BLIMT. HE IS STARTING TO LAY OUT A READ\nTHAT CAT. >> ALL THAT STUFF.\nIT IS BALL SAYING HERE'SY LOST AND HERE'S WHY YOU SHOULD STAY\nANGRY ABOUT THIS.

HE'S TELLING HIS SUPPORTERS THAT\nHE'S ONLY LOSING BECAUSE OF -- THAT HE'S NOW SEEKING TO\nDISCREDIT, DELEGITIMIZE AND STROIZ.\nTODAY HE LASHED OUT AT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY LEADER WHO\nREFUSES TO DEFEND HIM.

NO, HE DOESN'T DO THAT.\nTHERE'S A WHOLE DEAL GOING ON, WE'RE GOING TO FIGURE IT OUT.\nI ALWAYS FIGURE THINGS OUT. BUT THERE'S A WHOLE SINISTER\nDEAL GOING ON. >> IT'S JUST NOT PAUL RYAN THAT\nHE'S OUT TO -- IT'S THE POLLSTERS, HE CASTS AS CORRUPT.\nTHE MEDIA OUTLETS HE MONNIZES OVER AND OVER.\nAND PEOPLE AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF OUR GOVERNMENT WHO HE\nSUGGESTS ARE INVOLVED IN COLLUSION ON A MASS SCALE, TO\nKEEP CLINTON FROM GOING TO JAIL AND KEEP TRUMP OUT OF THE WHITE\nHOUSE. >> THIS CORRUPTION AND COLLUSION\nIS JUST ONE MORE REASON WHY I WILL ASK MY ATTORNEY GENERAL TO\nAPPOINT A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR. BUT WE HAVE TO ALSO, REMEMBER\nTHIS, REMEMBER THIS, THIS IS MAYBE IN A SENSE EVEN MORE\nIMPORTANT, WE HAVE TO INVESTIGATE THE INVESTIGATION.\nBUT WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU HAND THEM OVER TO THE FBI AND THE\nJUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND THAT'S THE END OF IT?\nWE HAVE NEVER BEEN IN A POSITION LIKE THIS, I'M SO EMBARRASSED BY\nWHAT'S TAKEN PLACE AND I'M VERY, VERY DISAPPOINTED IN CONGRESS\nBECAUSE OUR PEOPLE, OUR POLITICIANS, I DON'T KNOW, DO\nTHEY MAKE A DEAL WHERE EVERYBODY PROTECTS EACH OTHER IN\nWASHINGTON? MAYBE THAT'S IT.\nI REALLY BELIEVE IT. I REALLY BELIEVE IT.\nSHE DELETED THE E-MAILS, SHE HAS TO GO TO JAIL.\n>> DONALD TRUMP'S LASHING OUT, HIS WILLINGNESS TO DEMONIZE OUR\nMOST IMPORTANT INSTITUTIONS IN A DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO HELP\nHIMSELF HAS CONSEQUENCES, YET A TRUMP SUPPORTER SAID SHE WANTS A\nRE-LOOSE. LAST NIGHT NBC NEWS ASKED A\nDONALD TRUMP SUPPORTER WHO'S ACT WHAT HAPPENS IF DONALD TRUMP\nLOSES. >> I THINK PEOPLE ARE GOING TO\nRISE UP, BECAUSE WE'RE TIRED OF TAKING IT, WE'RE TIRED OF BEING\nDEPLORABLE. WE WANT TO BE THOUGHT OF AS\nAMERICANS INSTEAD OF JUST HER STEPPINGSTONE, SO YES, PEOPLE\nWILL PROBABLY RISE UP. WE WILL DEFEND OURSELVES AND\nMAKE SURE THAT THE LAWS THAT NEED TO BE INSTATED IN THIS\nCOUNTRY BE INSTATED AND NOT JUST FORGOTTEN.\nTAKE IT AS IT IS. YOU'RE IN THE SOUTH.\nWE'RE ALL SECOND AMENDMENT PROS. WE WANT OUR COUNTRY BACK, I CAN\nJUST SAY THAT. AND SHE'S NOT GOING TO GIVE IT\nTO US. >> FORMER WHITE HOUSE COUNCIL\nJOHN DEAN, AND A MAN WHO HAS EXPERIENCED SOME OF THE MOST\nHIGH STRESS SORT OF HIGH STAKE TESTS OF AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS\nOF DEMOCRACY, GIVEN THAT EXPERIENCE, WHAT'S GOING THROUGH\nYOUR HEAD AS YOU'RE WATCHING DONALD TRUMP INCREASINGLY MAKE\nTHIS CASE TO LAY THE GROUND WORK FOR A STORY SHOULD HE LOSE OF\nHOW THAT LOS IS ILL LEGITIMATE? >> I SEE A LOT OF SIMILARITIES\nBETWEEN NIXON AND TRUMP, THEY'RE BOTH AUTHORITARIAN\nPERSONALITIES, THE THING IS THAT TRUMP IS ACTUALLY AT THE EXTREME\nEND OF THAT. HE TAKES IT MUCH FURTHER THAN\nTHAT. HE MAKES NIXON SOMETHING OF A\nCHOIR BOY, I DON'T KNOW OF NIXON BEING A SEXUAL PREDATOR IN HIS\nTIME. BUT WHAT I SEE IS TYPICAL OF AN\nAUTHORITARIAN TYPE PERSONALITY. THEY CAN DO NO WRONG, EVERYBODY\nAROUND THEM IS WRONG. THEY'LL DO WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO\nWIN AT ALL COSTS, THAT'S WHAT NIXON DID TRYING TO WIN THE\nELECTION, HE SUCCEEDED THEN HE GOT CAUGHT AND HE TRIED TO USE\nTHE SYSTEM IN ANY WAY HE COULD TO PROTECT HIMSELF BUT IT DIDN'T\nWORK AND WHEN THE FINAL, REALLY THE FINAL LIE GOT TOLD AND WAS\nPUT TO HIM, HE ACTUALLY WENT WILLINGLY, HE SAID, YOU KNOW,\nIT'S UP AND HE WALKED AWAY FROM IT, WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN ONE OF\nHIS GRANDER MOMENTS BECAUSE HE HAD THE ARMY ON HIS SIDE.\n>> THIS IS THE KEY TO ME, BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT HOW\nDEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS FUNCTION, THEY FUNCTION\nESSENTIALLY ON NORMS OF CONDUCT. AND ULTIMATELY WHEN HE IS\nCONFRONTED BY BARRY GOLDWATER AND OTHERS, AFTER THE FAMOUS\nMIDNIGHT MASSACRE AND SAID YOU GOT TO GO.\nHE DIDN'T ORDER THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO ARREST THEM, OR\nTHE MILITARY TO GO INTO A STATE OF EMERGENCY WHICH IS WHAT COULD\nHAVE HAPPENED AND HAPPENS IN PLACES AROUND THE WORLD ALL THE\nTIME. THIS QUESTION OF WHAT TRUMP DOES\nSHOULD HE LOSE WITHOUT THE POWER OF PRESIDENCY, IN TERMS OF\nEATING AT THAT INSTITUTIONAL LEGITIMACY.\n>> CHRIS, WHAT HE REALLY IS, HE'S SORT OF THE PRODUCT OF\nWHAT'S BEEN GOING ON IN THE DEVELOP FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS,\nAYE WRITTEN ABOUT IT AT SOME LENGTH BECAUSE I FIND IT\nSURPRISING AND SOMEWHAT DISTRESSING IS THEY'RE GAMING\nTHE S DEMOCRAT MOCK I IS FRAGILE AND IT DOES BASE ITSELF ON\nPEOPLE PERFORMING IN A NORM CONSISTENT WAY AND NOT MISTREAT\nTHE SYSTEM BY MISBEHAVING, THE FACT THAT HE'S TRYING TO WIN THE\nELECTION BY OFFENDING AS MANY DEMOCRATIC VOTERS AS HE CAN SO\nTHEY'LL BE SO EXHAUSTED THEY WON'T WANT TO SHOW UP AT THE\nPOLLS AND HIS SUPPORTERS WILL SUPPORT HIM UNTIL THE END.\nI FIND IT DISQUIETING, AND IT'S THE FIRST ELECTION IN MY LIFE\nTHAT I FELT UNEASY. I THINK SENATOR GOLDWATER, I\nWASN'T WORRIED ABOUT HIM DOING SOMETHING LIKE STARTING A\nNUCLEAR WAR, IN FACT AS HE SAID TO MANY PEOPLE, I WOULDN'T VOTE\nFOR MYSELF GIVEN THE PORTRAIT OF WHO I WOULD BE PORTRAYED AS IN\nTHE MEDIA. THAT ISN'T THE CASE WITH DONALD\nTRUMP, HE'S REVEALING HIMSELF AND NOT BEING FALSELY PORTRAYED\nBY THE MEDIA. >> SO ONE OF THE KEY POINTS I\nTHINK ABOUT NIXON AND WATERGATE IS AT THE END OF THAT THERE WAS\nA KIND OF NATIONAL CONSENSUS, THERE REALLY WAS, THAT CRIMES\nHAD BEEN COMMITTED, THE PRESIDENT STEPPING DOWN WAS\nNECESSARY AND THE RIGHT THING TO DO, THAT THIS WAS -- YOU KNOW,\nTHE QUESTION IS CAN TRUMP SUPPORTERS, HIS CORE, TENS OF\nMILLIONS OF AMERICANS, DO WE HAVE THE MEDIA INSTITUTIONS OR\nANY OTHER INSTITUTIONS TO CONVINCE THEM THAT THE REJECTION\nOF HIM WAS RIGHT FOR THE COUNTRY.\n>> ONLY IF THE VOTE IS OVERWHELMING ENOUGH.\nIF IT'S AT ALL CLOSE, THEY'LL SAY IT WAS RIGGED AND THEY'LL\nFIGHT IT. IF IT WAS PRETTY OVERWHELMING,\nTHEY'LL HAVE TROUBLE DOING THAT. IF THE POLLS PARTICULARLY IN THE\nELECTION SHOW THAT HE'S LOSING, THAT WILL TEMPER THEM AND GIVE\nTHEM SOME ANTICIPATION OF WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.\n>> YOU THINK THE MARGINS MATTER A LOT IN TERMS OF THE LEGITIMACY\nOF WHAT HAPPENS ON ELECTION DAY? >> I THINK THIS GROUP WOULD SAY\nIT'S A FIX IF IT WASN'T SOMETHING REALLY OVERWHELMING,\nYES.",

HE TROTTED OUT SOME WOMEN, YOU\nKNOW, THAT HE CLAIMS BILL CLINTON HAD RELATIONSHIPS WITH.\nTHAT ALREADY RAISED THE TENSION AMONG OTHER WOMEN.\nTHE COUNTRY DOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS AND DURING THE DEBATE\nHE DENIED HE EVER ACTED THAT WAY.\nWHAT YOU HAVE IS ALL OF THESE WOMEN HAVE COME OUT NOW TO SAY,\nWAIT A MINUTE, OF COURSE YOU ACTED THIS WAY.\nTHEY WOULD HAVE BEEN QUIET, KATRINA, HAD HE NOT SAID HE HAD\nNEVER DONE ANYTHING. THAT'S WHAT EVERY ONE OF THEM\nHAD SAID. I DON'T THINK ANY ONE OF THESE\nPEOPLE WOULD BE OUT THERE THIS WEEK TELLING THEIR STORY.\n>> THAT'S NOT TRUE. >> THAT'S WHY THEY ALL SAID THEY\nCOME FORWARD. >> THAT'S NOT TRUE, HILLARY.\n>> WE DISCUSS AFTER THE BREAK.

NOW, THE WORD GROPED SHOULD\nIMPLY THAT THERE WASN'T CON SENT, BUT JUST BE EXTRA SURE WE\nALL KNOW WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE.\nLET'S JUST SAY I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO THE TIME WHEN\nCOVERING NATIONAL POLITICS NO LONGER HAS TO INCLUDE A WARNING\nTO GET THE KIDS OUT OF THE ROOM, BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET, SO I'LL\nGIVE YOU A SECOND TO PUT HEADPHONES ON JUNIOR.\nOKAY, SINCE LAST FRIDAY, SINCE THE RELEASE OF THE 2005 TAPE\nFROM ACCESS HOLLYWOOD, SHOWING LEWD AND FRANKLY PREDATORY\nREMARKS FROM DONALD TRUMP, BEHIND THE SCENES AT A\nCALIFORNIA TV SHOOT. THAT TAPE RECORDING ABOUT\nGRABBING WOMEN IN THE GENITALS AND KISSING THEM WITHOUT THEIR\nCONSENT AND GETTING AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE HE'S A STAR.\nEVER SINCE FRIDAY, THE HUNT HAS BEEN ON FOR MORE TAPES IN TV\nSHOW ARCHIVES MORE TAPES WRCHB DONALD TRUMP HAD A HABIT OF\nTALKING THAT WAY. BUT WHAT HAPPENED TONIGHT IS\nWOMEN COMING FORWARD ON THEIR OWN TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY SAY\nIS DONALD TRUMP'S PAST BEHAVIOR TOWARD THEM.\nIN REAL LIFE, NOT TALKING ABOUT STUFF, NOT THINGS HE SAID, BUT\nPHYSICAL ACTIONS HE ALLEGEDLY TOOK TOWARD THE VARIOUS WOMEN\nWHO ARE SPEAKING OUT TONIGHT. THE \"NEW YORK TIMES\" POST THIS\nLATE THIS EVENING, IT'S AN ACCOUNT FROM TWO DIFFERENT WOMEN\nWHO SAY THEY WERE GROPED BY DONALD TRUMP YEARS AGO.\nONE OF THE WOMEN WORKED AT A REAL ESTATE COMPANY THAT WAS\nHEADQUARTERED AT DONALD TRUMP TOWERS IN 2005.\nI'M JUST GOING TO READ YOU EXACTLY THE WAY THE \"NEW YORK\nTIMES\" REPORTED THIS THIS EVENING.\nSHE NAMED HERSELF TO THE TIMES, SHE IS NAMED RACHEL CROOKS, MS.\nCROOKS WAS A 22-YEAR-OLD RECEPTIONIST AT AN INVESTMENT\nAND REAL ESTATE COMPANY WHEN SHE ENCOUNTERED MR. TRUMP OUTSIDE\nTHE BUILDING ONE MORNING IN 2005, AWARE THAT HER COMPANY DID\nBUSINESS WITH MR. DONALD TRUMP, SHE TURNED AND INTRODUCED\nHERSELF TO HIM, SHE SHOOK HIS HAND BUT HE WOULD NOT LET GO.\nTHEN SHE SAID HE STARTED KISSING ME ON THE CHEEK.\nTHEN HE KISSED ME DIRECTLY ON THE THE MOUTH, IT DIDN'T FEEL\nLIKE AN ACCIDENT, IT FELT LIKE A VIOLATION.\nSHE IMMEDIATELY CALLED HER SISTER AND TOLD HER WHAT\nHAPPENED. THAT'S ONE OF THE ACCOUNTS\nTHAT'S IN THE \"NEW YORK TIMES\" TONIGHT.\nI MENTIONED THAT CALL TO HER SISTER IN OHIO BECAUSE THIS IS\nCLEARLY THE WAY THAT THE TIMES IS TRYING TO CORROBORATE SOME OF\nTHESE ALLEGATIONS. WHETHER THE WOMAN IN QUESTION\nTOLD OTHER PEOPLE ABOUT IT AT THE TIME.\nOBVIOUSLY IT'S TO A CERTAIN EXTENT GOING TO BE HE SAID SHE\nSAID, IF DONALD TRUMP DENIES THAT THIS HAPPENED.\nBUT THEY'RE LOOKING IN TERMS OF CHECKING OUT THE VORACITY OF\nTHIS ACCOUNT IF THERE IS ANYTHING CONTEMPORANEOUS.\nHERE'S THE SECOND ONE FROM THE SAME \"NEW YORK TIMES\" ACCOUNT,\nTHIS IS FROM JESSICA LEADS, MORE THAN THREE DECADES AGO, WHEN SHE\nWAS A TRAVELING BUSINESS WOMAN IT AT A PAPER COMPANY, JESSICA\nLEEDS SAYS SHE SAT BESIDE TRUMP IN A FIRST CLASS CABIN.\nTHEY HAD NEVER MET BEFORE. ABOUT 15 MINUTES AVENUE TAKEOFF,\nMR. DONALD TRUMP LIFTED THE ARMREST AND BEGAN TO TOUCH HER.\nMR. DONALD TRUMP GRABBED HER DRESS AND TRIED TO PUT HIS HANDS\nUP HER SKIRT. HE WAS LIKE AN OCTOPUS, HIS\nHANDS WERE EVERYWHERE. SHE FLED TO THE BACK OF THE\nPLANE. MS. LEADS TOLD THAT STORY TO AT\nLEAST FOUR PEOPLE CLOSE TO HER WHO ALSO SPOKE TO THE \"NEW YORK\nTIMES.\" CAN I JUST ASK IF WE HAVE THAT\nVIDEO THAT WE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE?\nWE HAVE A LITTLE CLIP OF A VIDEO THAT WAS POSTED BY THE \"NEW YORK\nTIMES,\" THESE ARE TWO NAMED WOMEN WHO SPOKE WITH THE \"NEW\nYORK TIMES\" TONIGHT, BOTH RECOUNTING INCIDENTS THAT\nHAPPENED A LONG TIME AGO. HERE'S ONE OF THE WOMEN\nEXPLAINING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.\n>> IF HE HAD STUCK WITH THE UPPER PART OF THE BODY, I MIGHT\nNOT HAVE GOTTEN -- I MIGHT NOT HAVE GOTTEN THAT UPSET.\nBUT IT'S WHEN HE STARTED PUTTING HIS HAND UP MY SKIRT, AND THAT\nWAS IT. THAT WAS IT.\nI -- I WAS OUT OF THERE. >> AGAIN, THAT'S ONE OF THE\nWOMEN WHO MADE THESE ALLEGATIONS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S BEHAVIOR\nTONIGHT IN THE \"NEW YORK TIMES.\" THERE'S TWO THINGS THAT I WANT\nTO TELL YOU ABOUT THIS \"NEW YORK TIMES\" REPORT THIS EVENING.\nAND THE FIRST ONE IS THAT DONALD TRUMP IS QUITE EMPHATICALLY\nDENYING THESE ALLEGATIONS. LET ME TELL YOU AGAIN EXACTLY\nHOW THE \"NEW YORK TIMES\" CHARACTERIZED HIS DENIAL\nTONIGHT. AND THIS ITSELF IS SORT OF --\nIT'S AT LEAST INTERESTING. QUOTE, IN A PHONE INTERVIEW ON\nTUESDAY NIGHT, A HIGHLY AGITATED MR. TRUMP DENIED EVERY ONE OF\nTHE WOMEN'S COMPLAINTS, NONE OF THIS EVER TOOK PLACE, HE WAS\nSHOUTING AT THE \"NEW YORK TIMES\" REPORTER, HE SAID THAT THE TIMES\nWAS MAKING UP THINGS NORD TO HURT HIM.\nHE SID, QUOTE, YOU ARE A DISGUSTING HUMAN BEING HE TOLD\nHER AS SHE QUESTIONED HIM ABOUT THE WOMEN'S CLAIMS.\nTHE OTHER THING I WANT TO TELL YOU IS THAT NBC NEWS, AND MSNBC\nWE HAVE NOT YET TALKED TO THESE WOMEN.\nTHE TIMES HAS DONE THE LEG WORK OF TALKING TO OTHER PEOPLE THAT\nTHESE WOMEN TOLD THESE STORIES TO.\nWE HAVE NOT CONFIRMED THESE REPORTS DIRECTLY WITH THESE\nWOMEN THEMSELVES.

              "text": "WANT HEADS TO ROLL.\nYOU GO TO THE VERY TOP. I UNDERSTAND WHAT DAN IS TALKING\nABOUT NOW. THEY'RE JUST LOOKING FOR\nSOMETHING. THEY NEED CHANGE.\nAND PEOPLE WERE VERY, VERY ANGRY, YOU COULD TELL BY THE\nREACTION THROUGHOUT THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS.\nAND WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON THERE. THEY WERE LOOKING FOR ANYTHING\nAND ANYBODY OF POSITION TO BE REMOVED, BECAUSE THAT WAS ONE OF\nTHE BIGGEST COMPLAINTS. THEY DIDN'T FEEL LIKE HIGH\nENOUGH FOLKS UP THERE ON THE LADDER WERE BEING TAKEN DOWN.\nTHEY JUST WENT TO THE TOP. THE TOP MAN IS NOW GONE.\n>> BUT THE OPTICS, HE'S RETIRING.\n>> CALL IT WHAT YOU WANT. I MEAN, IT'S FINE.\n>> NOT FIRED. >> UH --\n>> WHATEVER. >> NO, I GET IT -- BUT IN TERMS\nOF THE OPTICS. IF YOU WANT HEADS TO ROLL, YOU\nFIRE THE GUY. I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU KNOW,\nHE'S OUT -- HE'S OUT. >> HE'S OUT, HE'S OUT.\nOKAY. THAT'S FINE.\nI DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. RETIRED, WHATEVER IT IS.\nBUT I THINK IT'S ONE -- LISTEN, THIS IS ONE STEP CLOSER TO BEING\nABLE TO BE LONG WELLS FARGO. TO YOUR POINT, LISTEN, IS THERE\nLITIGATION RISK DOWN THE ROAD? I'M SURE -- I'M CERTAIN THERE\nIS. IS THIS QUARTER GOING TO BE SORT\nOF THE KITCHEN SINK QUARTER? I THINK IT'S ON FRIDAY, RIGHT?\nPROBABLY. BUT, YOU KNOW, NOW YOU HAVE TO\nSAY TO YOURSELF, HAS ENOUGH BAD NEWS BEEN PRICED IN THE STOCK\nWHERE IF YOU CAN GET THROUGH THIS QUARTER AT 11 TIMES OR SO\nFORWARD EARNINGS, WELLS FARGO IS INTERESTING.\nTO ME, THIS IS AN IMPORTANT -- I THINK IT'S A PRETTY IMPORTANT\nFIRST STEP. SO I'M MORE INCLINED TO BE LONG\nTHE STOCK TODAY AFTER THIS NEWS TH YESTERDAY.\n>> IN TERMS OF VALUATION, YOU MAKE THE POINT REPEATEDLY WELLS\nFARGO STILL TRADES AT A PREMIUM AND A ONE-PRICED BOOK.\n>> THE IRONY, THIS MAKES JPMORGAN LOOK FANTASTIC.\nAS PETE SAID, THEY WANT TO GO AFTER PEOPLE AND SOMEBODY\nSOMEWHERE, MAYBE EVERYBODY EVERYWHERE, WANTS CULPRITS AND\nSCAPEGOATS FOR EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED AFTER 2008.\nTHERE HAS BEEN ROUGH PATCHES FOR JPMORGAN, BUT HERE'S A GUY WHO\nCONTINUES TO SHOW UP EVERY DAY, TALK TO REGULATORS, THE BANK\nSECOND QUARTER, THEIR LOAN GROWTH IS THERE, A DIVERSIFIED\nMODEL. IT PUTS MORE OF A PREMIUM ON A\nDIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT, BOTH REGULATORY AND MARKET WISE, I\nTHINK JPMORGAN GETS A BENEFIT FROM THIS.\n>> JPMORGAN TRADING ROUGHLY AT 1.1 PRICE TO BOOK VERSUS 1.3 FOR\nWELLS FARGO VERSUS .86 OR .68, EXCUSE ME, FOR BANK OF AMERICA.\n>> AND THE OTHER THING YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER, GOING BACK AND\nI KNOW WE HAVE TALKED AT THE BREAKFAST MANY TIMES.\nBUT THE IDEA THAT JAMIE DECIDES TO GO IN AND SUDDENLY IT'S THE\nJAMIE BOTTOM. HE PUT A COMMITMENT DOWN WE\nDIDN'T SEE OUT OF A LOT OF THE OTHER BANKERS.\nI THINK THAT WAS VERY CRITICAL, AS WELL.\n>> WE'VE GOT SOME MORE DEVELOPMENTS.\nLET'S GO BACK TO DOM CHU IN THE NEWS ROOM.\n>> SO MELISSA, GUYS, WE NOW HAVE CONFIRMATION FROM WELLS FARGO IN\nA PRESS RELEASE, WELLS FARGO GOES THROUGH THE HEADLINES THAT\nWE JUST BROUGHT YOU. THE FACT THAT CHAIRMAN AND CEO,\nJOHN STUMPF, HAS INFORMED THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS HE'S RETIRING\nFROM THE COMPANY EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY.\nTHE BOARD HAS ELECTED TIM SLOAN, THE COMPANY'S PRESIDENT AND COO\nTO SUCCEED HIM. STEVEN SANGER, ITS LEAD\nDIRECTOR, WILL SERVE AS THE BOARD'S NONEXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN\nAND INDEPENDENT ELECTOR LIZ BREATHE DUKE, VICE CHAIR.\nJUST SOME QUOTES WITH REGARD TO JOHN STUMPF.\nSTUMPF SAYING HE WAS GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE LED\nWELLS FARGO AND ALSO VERY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT ITS FUTURE\nBECAUSE OF THE TALENTED AND CARING TEAM MEMBERS AND THE\nSTAGECOACH WITH TENSE OF MILLIONS OF CUSTOMERS.\nTHEY HAVE BEEN COMMITTED AND IS FOCUSED ON MANAGING THE COMPANY.\nI HAVE DECIDED IT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE COMPANY I STEP\nASIDE. I KNOW NO BETTER INDIVIDUAL TO\nLEAD THIS COMPANY FORWARD THAN TIM SLOAN.\nALSO GOING ON TO SAY SOME MORE WORDS ABOUT THE HISTORY OF HIS\nTIME THERE. THE IMMEDIATE AND HIGHEST\nPRIORITY IS TO RESTORE ITS TRUST IN WELLS FARGO.\nA TREMENDOUS RESPONSIBILITY, ONE WHICH I LOOK FORWARD TO TAKING\nON, SAID TIM SLOAN, THE NEW COO ELECT HERE.\nWILL WORK TIRELESSLY TO BUILD A STRONGER AND BETTER WELLS FARGO\nFOR GENERATIONS TO COME. SO, AGAIN, THOSE SHARES, THEY\nHAVE HELD FAIRLY STEADY. YOU CAN SEE THE SPIKE THERE, 2%.\nBUT NOW IT'S ON THE RECORD. WELLS FARGO SAYING THAT JOHN\nSTUMPF HAS DECIDED TO RETIRE AND WILL BE SUCCEEDED BY TIM SLOAN\nAS THE CEO. STEVEN SANGER BECOMES THE\nNONEXECUTIVE CHAIRPERSON THERE, AND DIRECTOR ELIZABETH DUKE THE\nVICE CHAIR. SHE IS ONE OF THE LEAD\nINDEPENDENT DIRECTORS, AND INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR NOW\nELIZABETH DUKE, VICE CHAIR. SO A LOT OF DEVELOPMENTS, A LOT\nOF PEOPLE MOVING AROUND HERE. BUT STILL, PERHAPS NOT A\nSURPRISE TO SOME, MELISSA, ABOUT JOHN STUMPF.\nBUT STILL, THIS NEWS IS SENDING THOSE SHARES HIGHER.\nWE SHOULD NOTE THAT THE SHARES WERE DOWN ABOUT 14% DURING THIS\nKIND OF MELEE DURING THE CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS AND WHAT\nNOT. THEY HAVE STARTED TO MOVE A\nLITTLE HIGHER IN JUST THE LAST COUPLE DAYS.\n>> WE SHOULD ALSO -- YOU'VE GOT TO WONDER, DOM, IN TERMS OF THE\nWORDING OF HIM STEPPING DOWN, HIM RETIRING VERSUS HIM BEING\nRELEASED, OR HIM BEING FIRED, COULD VERY WELL BE AN EFFORT TO\nPRESERVE SOME SORT OF GOLDEN PARACHUTE OR SEPARATION\nAGREEMENT SO HE WILL WALK AWAY WITH SOME SORT OF SEVERANCE.\n>> THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHAT THE OPERATION PACKAGE WILL END\nUP BEING. WE KNOW THEY HAVE ALREADY -- A\nGROUP OF PEOPLE HAVE FORFEITED SOME PORTIONS OF THEIR BONUSES\nOR SALARIES OR UNVESTED STOCK OPTIONS IN THE COMPANY OR\nRESTRICTED STOCK IN THE COMPANY. STILL, THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE\nIT APPEARS AS THOUGH JOHN STUMPF IS BEING GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY\nTO LEAVE ON HIS OWN TERMS, TAKING THIS TYPE OF RETIREMENT\nROUTE AS OPPOSED TO BEING OUSTED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.\nBUT EFFECTIVELY, WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE -- AND SAID IT IN THE\nRELEASE, IT'S PARTY FOR HIM TO KIND OF MOVE ON AND FOR TIM\nSLOAN TO TAKE OVER THE REIGNS AND RESTORE WHAT'S GOING TO\nHAPPEN TO WELLS FARGO'S REPUTATION.\n>> LAST TRADE, $46.30, $3 OFF THE 52-WEEK LOW.\n>> THIS IS A $230 BILLION MARKET COMPANY, WITH 270,000 EMPLOYEES,\nLESS THE 5,300 THEY FIRED LAST MONTH.\nI HAVE TO THINK THE COO, PRESIDENT, WHO IS NOW THE CEO,\nWAS MORE INVOLVED WITH WHATEVER THE PRACTICES WERE GOING ON.\nSO TO ME, I FIND THIS TO BE LIKE A HALF MEASURE.\n>> TO BE FAIR, DOES IT -- HE BECAME PRESIDENT AND COO IN\nNOVEMBER OF 2015. SO WAS IN PLACE WHEN THE -- WHEN\nTHE PRACTICES WERE GOING ON. BUT NOT FOR THE ENTIRE TIME WHEN\nTHE \"L.A. TIMES\" FIRST UNSURFACED THESE ALLEGATIONS.\n>> A BUNCH OF SENIOR POSITIONS, FOR 29 YEARS.\nAND TWO DAYS AGO MADE A BUNCH OF MANAGEMENT CHANGES THAT PAVED\nTHE WAY FOR THIS. TWO DAYS AGO, BIG ARTICLES, WE\nSOLIDIFIED THE FOUNDATION UNDER TIM SLOAN.\nIT ALL COMES AT A TIME WHEN THERE IS A PRETTY INTERESTING\nCHANGE GOING ON IN WEALTH MANAGEMENT AND ASSET MANAGEMENT,\nPERIOD. A LOT OF CONTROVERSY WHETHER\nPEOPLE -- ACCOUNTS SHOULD BE CHARGED ON THE WAYSIS  BASIS OF\nTHEIR ASSETS, FEES. MORGAN STANLEY DISPUTED THAT,\nWELLS FARGO. SO THERE IS A LOT OF -- AT A\nTIME WHEN PEOPLE ARE IN UPROAR OVER THIS SITUATION BECAUSE IT'S\nGOING ON ALL OVER THE INDUSTRY, I THINK THE WHOLE INDUSTRY IS\nGOING TO BE UNDER FIRE. >> OH, DEFINITELY.\nLET'S GET TO CNBC'S, WILL FORD FROST ON THE FAST LINE,\nFOLLOWING THIS STORY FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.\nWHAT CAN YOU TELL US? >> HEY, MELISSA.\nI JUST WANTED TO ADD SOME MORE CONTEXT TO THIS.\nAS YOU GUYS HAVE ALREADY DISCUSSED VERY MUCH THIS BEING\nFRAMED AS A RETIREMENT, NOT BEING FIRED.\nSTEVEN SANGER, NONEXECUTIVE BOARD SAYING IN A STATEMENT\nWHICH YOU GUYS HAVE ALREADY COVERED THAT HE, JOHN STUMPF,\nFELT IT WAS TIME TO MOVE ON, AND HE ALSO SAID THAT MR. STUMPF HAD\nDEDICATED HIS PROFESSIONAL LIFE TO BANKING, LEADING WELLS FARGO\nTHROUGH THE CRISIS. MR. STUMPF IN A STATEMENT SAYING\nI'M GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE\nOF THE BANK. VERY MUCH FRAMED AS A\nRETIREMENT. IN TIMES -- IN TERMS OF THE\nTIMING OF THIS, IS IT STILL IS A SURPRISE.\nYES, WE HAD THE ANNOUNCEMENT EARLIER THIS WEEK SOLIDIFYING\nTIM SLOAN'S ROLE AS COO AND DIRECTLY REPORTING TO MR.\nSTUMPF. HE HAS BEEN IN THAT ROLE, AS UP\nSINCE DECEMBER OF 2015, ALSO HEAD OF BANKING UNTIL THIS WEEK.\nSO THAT REMOVAL PERHAPS PAVED THE A WAY A LITTLE BIT.\nKMEBTSZ REPORTED BY THE \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" EARLIER THIS\nWEEK HAD HIM SAYING HE WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO THE EARNINGS\nCALL, WHICH IS THIS FRIDAY. AND SETTING OUT THE PLAN FOR THE\nCOMPANY MOVING FORWARD. SO IT DOES COME AS A SURPRISE,\nAND, OF COURSE, JUST TWO WEEKS AGO AT THE SENATE HEARING, MR.\nSTUMPF COMMITTED, HE BEING THE PERSON THAT WANTED TO LEAD THIS\nFORWARD. CLEARLY, THE PRESSURE HAS GOT\nTOO MUCH. FRAMED AS A RETIREMENT.\nBUT NO DOUBT THE PRESSURE INTERNALLY AND EXTERNAL ALSO\nFORCING THE HAND IN TERMS OF THE DECISION TO MOVE ON.\nGUYS? >> WILL, THANK YOU SO MUCH.\nWILFRED FROST JOINING US. AND SHARES NOW UP BY 1.5%.\nFIRST ANALYST TO SLAP A SELL RATING ON THE STOCK, DICK, GREAT\nTO HAVE YOU WITH US. DOES ITS REMOVAL MAKE YOU\nINCLINED TO RETHINK YOUR SELL RATING?\n>> NO, A SELL IS A SELL AND A SELL IS BASED UPON THE FACT THE\nFUNDAMENTALS OF THIS COMPANY DO NOT MERIT THE PREMIUM IT SELLS\nRELATIVE TO BOOK VALUE. IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE\nPRETAX, PRE -- YOU KNOW, PROVISION EARNINGS OF THIS\nCOMPANY, FROM 2009 TO THE PRESENT, THEY HAVE NOT GONE UP\nYOU. 100% OF THE INCREASE IN EARNINGS\nAT WELLS FARGO HAS COME FROM THE REDUCING THE RESERVE.\nZERO PERCENT OF THE INCREASE IN THE PRETAX EARNINGS HAVE COME\nFROM AN INCREASE IN THEIR OPERATING BUSINESS.\nTHE COMPANY NOT ONLY HAS NOT SHOWN ANY IMPROVEMENT IN ITS\nPROFITS, AS I WOULD TELL ABOUT THEM -- PRETAX, PREPROVISION.\nBUT IT PUT ALL THE EXTREME SALES EFFORT, BECAUSE IT NEEDED TO TO\nBUILD THE BUSINESS, WHICH WASN'T GROWING.\nTHE FACT THAT JPMORGAN HAS SHOWN CONTINUOUS GROWTH IN EARNINGS\nTHROUGH THIS PERIOD, AND WELLS FARGO HAS SHOWN NO GROWTH IN\nEARNINGS WOULD TELL YOU THAT THIS COMPANY DOES NOT DESERVE\nTHE PREMIUM, JPMORGAN DOES. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE THE\nPREMIUM TO JPMORGAN, THEN YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE THIS COMPANY DOWN TO\nWHERE JPMORGAN IS SELLING, WHICH IS SOMEWHERE AROUND 110% OF\nBOOK. IN TERMS OF THE FUTURE, THIS\nCOMPANY IS FACING SOME MAJOR, MAJOR CHANGES.\nTHE FIRST ONE WOULD SAY INDICATED A COUPLE DAYS AGO WHEN\nTHEY SUGGESTED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO MOVE FROM DE\nCENTRALIZED OPERATION TO A CENTRALIZED OPERATION.\nTHAT IS ENORMOUSLY EXPENSIVE. IT WILL ADD TO THE COST OF\nRUNNING THIS BUSINESS. THEY PUT 2,000 PEOPLE IN PLACE\nWHO ARE GOING TO BE GOING OUT TO THESE BRANCHES, LOOKING OVER THE\nSHOULDERS OF MANAGERS, TELLING THEM NOT TO DO BAD THINGS,\nWHATEVER BAD THINGS MIGHT BE. >> SO DICK --\n>> THAT IS GOING TO SLOW DOWN THE REVENUES OF THE COMPANY AND\nFURTHER INCREASE THE COST OF RUNNING THE BUSINESS.\nSTOCK IS A SELL. >> SO YOU DON'T LIKE THE\nCOMPANY'S RESTRUCTURING, YOU DON'T LIKE THE FUNDAMENTALS OF\nTHE BUSINESS. YOU DOUBT THE EARNINGS QUALITY\nOF THE COMPANY -- IF WE CAN JUST ISOLATE FOR THIS PARTICULAR\nDEVELOPMENT IN THE STORY, ISOLATE THE HEADLINE RISK TO THE\nBANK FROM CONGRESS. DOES THIS AMELIORATE THE RAGE OF\nTHE SENATORS AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE?\n>> IT CERTAINLY REDUCES THE FACTUAL GET FROM PEOPLE LIKE\nSENATOR WARREN. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, THE\nBIG ISSUE THE CONGRESS IS GOING TO BE DEALING WITH IS NOT, YOU\nKNOW, WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CUSTOMERS WHO PAID 25 BUCKS\nTHERE WAS AN ACCOUNT THAT WAS OPEN.\nBUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE EMPLOYEES?\nIN OTHER WORDS, IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE STORIES\nCOMING IN TO ME, AND I WOULD ASSUME EVERYBODY ELSE, GIVING AN\nEXAMPLE -- THERE WAS THIS WOMAN WHO WORKED FOR WELLS FARGO FOR\nFIVE YEARS. SHE WAS TOLD IF SHE DIDN'T MEET\nTHESE SALES GOALS, YOU KNOW, SHE WOULD BE FIRED AND WELLS FARGO\nWOULD MAKE SURE THAT SHE WAS NEVER HIRED AGAIN IN BANKING.\nSHE ULTIMATELY WAS FIRED, THEY PUT SOMETHING ON HER U-5, WHICH\nIS LIKE THE U-4 IN OUR BUSINESS, AND SHE, IN FACT, WAS INDICATED\nSHE WAS FIRED FOR CAUSE, AND SHE WAS NEVER -- SHE NEVER GOT\nANOTHER JOB IN BANKING. IT'S THE TREATMENT OF THOSE\nPEOPLE WHICH IS GOING TO BE A SOURCE OF -- IF YOU WILL,\nCONGRESSIONAL INQUIRY. >> ARE WE GOING TO GET A NEXT\nLEG OF SCRUTINY ON WELLS FARGO? I MEAN, ARE WE GOING TO HEAR\nTHAT JOHN STUMPF HAS QUOTE, UNQUOTE, RETIRED SO THEREFORE HE\nWALKS AWAY WITH A PAY PACKAGE, YOU KNOW, X NUMBER OF DOLLARS\nBIG? I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT\nSTUMPF AND THE SORTS OF AGREEMENTS HE MIGHT HAVE TO\nPRESERVE SOME SORT OF SEVERANCE? >> MY FEELING IS THAT THE -- YOU\nKNOW, IF YOU WILL, CONCENTRATION ON JOHN STUMPF IS TOTALLY\nMISPLACED. YOU KNOW, HE MAY WALK AWAY WITH\nA NICE PACKAGE. IN MY VIEW, HE DID A LOT OF VERY\nGOOD THINGS WHEN HE WAS AT WELLS FARGO.\nTHE ACQUISITION OF WACHOVIA WAS A BIG SUCCESS.\nTHE ABILITY TO MOVE THE COMPANY INTO THE CAPITAL MARKETS AREA\nWAS A BIG SUCCESS. THE ABILITY TO CONTROL EXPENSES\nWAS A BIG SUCCESS. SO JOHN STUMPF WAS NOT A BAD\nGUY. HE DID A LOT OF GOOD THINGS FOR\nTHIS COMPANY. AND THE FACT HE MAY WALK AWAY\nWITH A NICE PAY PACKAGE IS IRRELEVANT.\nWHAT IS RELEVANT, IF I'M BUYING THE STOCK, IS NOT HOW MUCH MONEY\nJOHN STUMPF IS GETTING. IT'S HOW MUCH MONEY DO I MAKE IF\nI OWN THE STOCK? AND IT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH\nJOHN STUMPF ON HIS WALK-AWAY PACKAGE.\nEVERYTHING TO DO WITH WHETHER THIS COMPANY CAN SHOW INCREASED\nEARNINGS OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS AND I DON'T THINK IT CAN.\n>> OKAY. DICK, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR\nPHONING IN. DICK BOVE.\nI BRING UP THE PAY PACKAGE ONLY BECAUSE IF THIS MOVE WAS IN PART\nTO SORT OF MOVE THE SCRUTINY AWAY FROM WELLS FARGO FROM A\nREGULATORY STANDPOINT, A GIANT SEVERANCE PACKAGE IS NOT --\nCOMPLETELY GET WHAT HE'S SAYING ABOUT THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE\nCOMPANY. BUT IF YOU HAVE THE BUCKET OF\nTHE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE COMPANY AND THE BUCKET OF THE OPTICS ON\nTHE COMPANY, THESE ARE TWO THINGS THAT NEED TO SORT OF --\n>> THE OPTICS AREN'T GREAT, BUT I LIKE WHAT DICK WAS SAYING.\nHE IS SAYING WHAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE ALSO SAID ABOUT THE\nCOMPANY, THE EARNINGS HAVEN'T BEEN THAT GREAT.\nTHEY DON'T DESERVE THE PREMIUM THEY HAD.\nTHAT'S DOUBLE PRESSURE, ESPECIALLY AT A TIME WHEN, AS\nYOU SAID, THE OPTICS AREN'T SO GOOD.\n>> SO NOW I THINK WARREN BUFFETT HAS BEEN QUIET, EXCEPT HE HASN'T\nSAID ANYTHING. YOU WONDER TOMORROW OR LATER\nTHIS AFTERNOON, DOES HE MAKES COMMENTS ABOUT WHAT HE FEELS\nABOUT HIS INVESTMENT GOING FORWARD BASED ON THE NEWS WE\nHEARD. HE HAS BEEN SURPRISINGLY QUIET.\nONE HAS TO WONDER, DOES HE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO INCREASE?\nIN OTHER WORDS, I'M NOT SURE WHAT HIS RESTRICTIONS ARE.\nBUT IF SO, DOES THIS OPEN UP HIS WALLET TO BUY MORE WELLS FARGO\nSTOCK? >> ALL RIGHT.\nWE'VE GOT TO TAKE A BREAK HERE. LET'S TAKE A CHECK ON SHARES OF\nWELLS FARGO. WE HAD SEEN IT MOVE AS HIGH\nAS -- MORE THAN 2% IN THE AFTER HOURS SESSION, NOW UP BY 1.5%.\nIN CASE YOU'RE JUST JOINING US, THE BREAKING NEWS THAT HAPPENED\nIN THE PAST 17 MINUTES, JOHN STUMPF ANNOUNCING HIS\nRETIREMENT, EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY.\nIT IS THE STORY OF THE HOUR. IT WILL BE THE STORY TOMORROW,\nAS WELL. WE'LL BRING YOU MORE BREAKING\nCOVERAGE AS IT DEVELOPS.",

NO EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT,\nSEVERANCE AGREEMENTS OR GOLDEN PARACHUTE AGREEMENTS ARE PART OF\nTHIS AS PER THEIR PROXY. WE'LL TRY TO GO INTO MORE DETAIL\nABOUT THIS. THAT'S WHAT WELLS FARGO'S\nPOSITION IS RIGHT NOW WITH REGARD TO WHETHER OR NOT HE WILL\nGET A GOLDEN PARACHUTE. THEY SAY NO, BUT WE'LL BRING IN\nMORE DETAILS AS THINGS DEVELOP ON OUR SIDE OF THINGS, MELISSA.\nBACK OVER TO YOU GUYS AT THE NASDAQ.\n>> THANK YOU SO MUCH, DOM CHU. SO HERE ARE THE HIGHLIGHTS.\nNO GOLDEN PARACHUTE HERE. PETE, YOU'RE MAKING THE POINT\nHE'S NOT THE ONLY CEO WHO MADE SOME WELL-TIMED TRANSACTIONS\nSURROUNDING HIS OWN STOCK. >> IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS, WE\nHAVE SEEN SOME PRETTY BIG TRANSACTIONS FROM MR. STUMPF AND\nSOME. INSIDERS --\n>> IT COULD BE A PLANNED SALE. >> COULD BE AND EXERCISING\nOPTIONS. BUT WELL-TIMED, GIVEN WHERE THEY\nWERE SELLING AT IN TERMS OF THE PRICE OF THE STOCK.\nAND WHERE THE STOCK IS NOW, AND OBVIOUSLY THE CIRCUMSTANCES THEY\nFACE NOW. >> ALL RIGHT.\nYOU MAY REMEMBER OUT THERE WE INTERVIEWED JAMIE DIMON ON\n\"POWER LUNCH\" AND HE ADDRESSED WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH WELLS\nFARGO AND SPECIFICALLY MR. STUMPF.\nTAKE A LISTEN. >> JOHN STUMPF IS A QUALITY\nHUMAN BEING AND A FRIEND OF MINE.\nAND I HOPE WELLS GET THIS PROBLEM -- OBVIOUSLY, THESE\nPROBLEMS HAPPEN. EVERY BANK IS QUESTIONED ABOUT\nTHEIR PRACTICE AND EVERY BANK IS GOING TO COOPERATE.\nWHICH THEY SHOULD. AND IN DUE COURSE, PEOPLE\nJUST -- DISCLOSE THE POSITIVE PROCEDURES.\nI THINK COOL HEADS SHOULD PREVAIL SOMETIMES.\n>> WHATEVER HEAD PREVAILED HERE, AGAIN, JOHN STUMPF RETIRING,\nEFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY. IN TERMS OF THE FALLOUT FOR THE\nENTIRE SECTOR, JAMIE DIMON REFERENCED SCRUTINY.\nAND YOU HAVE TO WONDER IN TERMS OF REGULATIONS, PARTICULARLY\nDURING AN ELECTION SEASON WHERE THERE IS TALK ABOUT\nSTRENGTHENING DODD/FRANK, WHETHER OR NOT THERE WOULD BE\nSOME ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS PUT ON BANKERS FOR PRODUCTS THAT\nSHOULD BE BOUGHT AND NOT SOLD. IF THERE COULD BE A FIDUCIARY\nREQUIREMENT PLACED ON RETAIL BANKERS, WHICH WOULD COMPLETELY\nCHANGE THE TRAINING PROCESS, THE RECRUITMENT PROCESS, THE PAY FOR\nTHESE WORKERS. >> WHO LOOKS LIKE A RABID DOG\nWHEN STUMPF WAS ON THE HILL, ELIZABETH WARREN.\nIF DEMOCRATS TAKE THE SENATE WHICH IT LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE, IS\nSHE GOING TO BE THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE BANKING COMMITTEE AND IS\nTHIS A HEADWIND GOING FORWARD FOR THE BANKING SECTOR.\nTO ME -- I THINK THAT WAS NOT SOMETHING PEOPLE WERE\nCONSIDERING JUST A MONTH AGO. >> THE FACT THAT THIS IS\nAFFECTING RETAIL CUSTOMERS DIRECTLY AS OPPOSED TO AN\nINVESTMENT BANKING ELEMENT I THINK IS GOING TO MAKE THIS A\nLOT WORSE. THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN BULLYING\nPEOPLE FOR A LONG TIME AND THEY'LL GET WHAT THEY HAVE\nCOMING TO THEM. EARNINGS SEASON IS RIGHT BACK\nUPON US. THE EQUITY CAPITAL MARKETS\nBUSINESS AND SOME OF THE UNDERWRITING ON THE DEBT SIDE\nHAS BEEN VERY, VERY GOOD. I THINK THERE WILL BE A\nSURPRISE. REMEMBER THE SECOND QUARTER.\n>> IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF ANYBODY COMMENTS ON WHAT\nTHEIR -- THEY'RE GOING TO GET THE QUESTION ON THE CONFERENCE\nCALL ABOUT INCREASED REGULATION. >> NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.\nAND THE POLITICAL SEASON, DAN POINTS OUT.\nTHAT REALLY IS A GAME-CHANGER AND COULD CHANGE OPINIONS, I\nTHINK, AS WE GET INTO NOVEMBER IN TERMS OF MY OWN POSITIONS IN\nSOMETHING LIKE A BANK OF AMERICA OR WHATEVER.\nBUT YOU LOOK AT WHAT JPMORGAN WHEN THEY REPORT, I THINK\nTHEY'LL REPORT SOME PRETTY INTERESTING NUMBERS, IN\nPARTICULAR STRONGER NUMBERS THAN WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT NOW JUST\nBASED UPON HOW LOW THE BAR IS SET.\n>> OCTOBER 14th, AS WELL? SO IF KAREN WERE HERE, SHE WOULD\nSAY, AND I'M GIVING PROPS. IF THEY HAVE EVERY REASON TO\nKITCHEN SINK -- TO EXTENT THEY CAN -- NO IDEA IF THEY CAN OR\nNOT. TO THE EXTENT THEY CAN, THIS\nWOULD BE A GREAT QUARTER TO KITCHEN SINK.\n>> WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR THE TRADE?\n>> YOU HAVE TO SEE HOW THE STOCK REACTS IF THEY DO THAT KITCHEN\nSINK. IF IT'S NOT A DISASTER IN TERMS\nOF STOCK PERFORMANCE, THEN MAYBE WE CAN SIT HERE AND SAY, LISTEN,\nWE KNOW ALL OF THE HEAD WINDS THERE --\n>> THIS GETS YOU BACK TO A COMPANY THAT MAYBE DIDN'T\nDESERVE TO TRADE AT THOSE MULTIPLES EVER.\nAND, AGAIN, THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS WE JUST TALKED ABOUT,\nDICK BOVE BROUGHT IT UP. YOU CAN GO BACK FIVE EARNINGS ON\nTHE EARNINGS AND SAY THIS IS ABOUT LOAN/LOSS PROVISIONS.\nWE KNOW THE DEPOSIT BASE ISN'T THE SAME. MAYBE NOT ROBUST AFTER THIS, AS\nWELL. >> RIGHT.\n>> I'LL JUST SAY THIS. 40% OF THE XLF IS REPORTING,\nFRIDAY MORNING. SO THE WAY I SEE IT, THE XLF IS\nA DIFFERENT PERCENT -- IT HAS LAGGED THE S&P AND YOU MAY GET\nGOOD RESULTS OUT OF JPMORGAN AND IT'S ALSO UP FROM THE 52-WEEK\nLOWS. WHAT IF WE JUST GET ONE RATE\nINCREASE IN DECEMBER LIKE LAST YEAR, AND IT JUST DOESN'T SET UP\nGREAT FOR THE BANKS. MAYBE JPMORGAN MAKES A NEW HIGH.\nWELLS FARGO WAS THE ONLY BANK, THE ONLY MEGA CAP BANK THAT MADE\nA NEW HIGH FOLLOWING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND LOOK WHERE\nIT IS NOW. SO I DON'T THINK THE BANKS ARE\nTHAT COMPELLING. >> IN TERMS OF THE SCANDAL\nSPECIFICALLY FOR WELLS FARGO, HOW MUCH DOES JOHN STUMPF'S\nRESIGNATION, RETIREMENT, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT,\nHOW MUCH DOES THAT PUT IT IN THE REAR-VIEW MIRROR?\nHAS MUCH CHANGED? >> I THINK IT HAS CHANGED.\nI THINK -- TIM POINTS OUT THE RETAIL CUSTOMERS.\nI THINK THE RETAIL CUSTOMERS -- DAN IS TALKING ABOUT THIS\nGENTLEMEN -- AND BY THE WAY, HE'S BEEN THERE 9 YEARS.\nSO IT'S NOT LIKE HE'S BRAND NEW TO WELLS FARGO.\n>> DON'T YOU MAYBE WANT SOMEBODY BRAND-NEW?\n>> MAYBE. BUT OPTICALLY THEY WANT TO SEE\nSOMEBODY GET TAKEN DOWN THAT AND WILL BE DECENT.\n>> SO FOR YOU, THE SCANDAL HAS RECEDED.\n>> VERY MUCH. >> ARE YOU LEFT WITH TAKING A\nLOOK AT THE COMPANY WHOSE FUNDAMENTALS ARE IN QUESTION,\nWHOSE PRICE TO BOOK MAY BE TOO HIGH?\n>> YES. I AGREE WITH ALL OF THAT.\nBUT IF THEY CAN COME OUT OF THIS THING OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF\nQUARTERS, THAT WOULD BE VERY, VERY IMPRESSIVE.\nAND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD BE\nWILLING TO BET ON, GIVEN WHERE THEY ARE.\nAND IT'S NOT FUNDAMENTALLY BROKEN.\nIT'S JUST MAYBE AHEAD OF ITSELF. >> ONE THING ABOUT ALL OF THESE\nREGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS AND WHAT'S GOING ON HERE -- I'M NOT\nGOING TO SAY THIS IS WHAT'S  CRIMINAL CHARGES IS EXACTLY WHAT\nTHEY WANT TO SEE IN WASHINGTON, MAIN STREET, AND LET'S FACE IT,\nWE GOT OUT OF THE 2008 CRISIS. WHO IS WHO OF BIG NAME CEOs WERE\nREPLACED. THIS IS PART DEAX.\n>> HOW IS SLOAN NOT ON THAT MENU?\nI DISAGREE WITH YOU. >> OPTICALLY, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN\nBETTER. BUT FROM\nSTANDPOINT -- >> JUST BRING IN ALL NEW?\nAND WHAT TYPE OF TRANSITION/ -- >> YOU AND I WILL BE BUDDIES --\nIF YOU GAVE THE OVER/UNDER IN TWO YEARS --\n>> STUMPF -- >> MUCH BETTER CHANCE OF US NOT\nBEING BUDDIES. >> FOCUS, PEOPLE!\nFOCUS! >> THE FOCUS IS THIS.\nTHE STOCK NOT TRADING WELL SINCE THE MIDDLE OF LAST YEAR.\nTHIS WAS A $58 STOCK IN THE MIDDLE OF 2015.\nWHICH ON A DECENT TAPE, SIDEWAYS TAPE, HAS BEEN SLOWLY BLEEDING\nTO THE DOWN SIDE. I UNDERSTAND VALUATIONS ARE\nSTRETCHED, MAYBE STILL. BUT IF THEY COME OUT KITCHEN\nSINK THIS QUARTER ON FRIDAY AND THE STOCK DOESN'T PERFORM\nTERRIBLY, MAYBE THAT'S A SELL YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR.\n>> TO DAN WHO WE MIGHT NOT BECOME FRIENDS AFTER THIS -- I\nDON'T CARE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. THE -- WHO CARES OFF THE 52-WEEK\nLOW. GETTING PUSHED AROUND FOR OIL\nCREDIT CONCERNS, PUSHED AROUND FOR THINGS THAT REALLY WERE I\nTHINK BOTH ERRONEOUS AND ULTIMATELY AT A PLACE THEY MADE\nVERY GOOD MONEY IN THE SECOND QUARTER.\nTHE VALUATIONS AS CHEAP AS THEY HAVE EVER BEEN RELATIVE TO THE\nEARNINGS POWER. SORRY.\n>> ALL RIGHT. IF YOU ARE JUST JOINING US, HERE\nIS THE BOMBSHELL THAT HAPPENED JUST ABOUT 40 MINUTES AGO.\nCEO JOHN STUMPF OF WELLS FARGO RETIRING IMMEDIATELY, WILL NOT\nRECEIVE ANY SEVERANCE OR RETIREMENT PACKAGE, ACCORDING TO\nTHE BANK. THE STOCK IS HIGHER IN THE AFTER\nHOURS SESSION, ALTHOUGH OFF THE HIGHS.\nSTILL UP 1.6%. MUCH MORE COVERAGE OF THIS STORY\nRIGHT AFTER THIS.",

I THINK IT'S FROM THE OPTIC\nPERSPECTIVE OF PEOPLE LOOKING FOR A HEAD TO ROLL THAT'S AT THE\nVERY TOP.

AND ULTIMATELY, WHEN THE\nSTOCKSTILL HAS A FAIR AMOUNT OF ISSUES HANGING OVER IT AND SOME\nQUESTIONS WHETHER THE NUMBERS WERE GOING TO BE AS GOOD AS THEY\nWERE IF THEY WEREN'T AS AGGRESSIVE AS THEY WERE WITH\nPEOPLE. I WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING.\n>> YEAH. WHAT IF WE DO SEE A DOWNDRAFT?\nLET'S SAY IT IS A KITCHEN SINK QUARTER?\nWHY WOULDN'T A NEW CEO DO THAT? THEY SHOULD THROW EVERYTHING OUT\nTHERE. >> THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY.\nA COUPLE THINGS. I GOT AN E-MAIL FROM DOUG.\nI MENTIONED WARREN BUFFETT ABOUT HIM POTENTIALLY COMMENTING.\nDOUG JUST SAID THAT BUFFETT WOULDN'T COMMENT ON WELLS FARGO\nUNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION. DOES THIS CHANGE?\nI HAVE NO IDEA. NUMBER TWO, IF THEY KITCHEN SINK\nIT AND IF THE STOCK DOESN'T TRADE TERRIBLY, IT'S ALL ABOUT\nTELL. MAYBE THAT'S THE TELL YOU'VE\nBEEN LOOKING FOR FOR WELLS FARGO.\nI POINTED OUT, THE STOCK HAS BEEN GOING OTHER FOR THE LAST\nYEAR. >> THERE IS NO KITCHEN SINK,\nIT'S NOT HAPPENING FRIDAY MORNING.\n>> WHY? >> LISTEN, THEY NEED TO SHOW\nCONFIDENCE IN THEIR FRANCHISE, IN THEIR BUSINESS.\nSO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO JUST DO THIS OPTICALLY TO SAY -- IT'S\nNOT A BLOODLETTING, AND, AGAIN, I'M GOING TO SAY IT.\nSLOAN IS NOT ENOUGH. HE'S NOT THE RIGHT CHOICE HERE.\nSO TO ME IF THEY CHOSE A GUY WHO HAS BEEN WORKING AT THE BANK\nTHREE DECADES -- >> THE CONSPIRACY THEORY WOULD\nBE HE RESIGNED EFFECTIVE -- AHEAD OF EARNINGS.\n>> AS A TRADER, IF YOU SOLD EVERY CONSPIRACY THEORY YOU EVER\nHEARD, YOU WOULD MAKE MONEY. I'M JUST TELLING YOU, DON'T WAIT\nFOR IT. >> THEY HAVE ALREADY HAD AN\nINTERNAL CALL WITH THE TOP 500 MANAGERS AND ALREADY INDICATED\nTHEY EXPECT -- >> BANKS ONLY TRADE WHERE THEY\nDO BECAUSE OF CONFIDENCE, RIGHT? AND IF THEY'RE GOING TO JUST GO\nOUT AND HAVE SOME ERRATIC SORT OF SITUATION HERE -- WE ALREADY\nKNOW WHAT THEIR SETTLEMENT WAS.

MR. SLOAN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH\nFOR YOUR TIME THIS EVENING. I WANTED TO ASK, IF I MAY, TO\nSTART, IF I MAY, BY ASKING WHETHER YOU FEEL MR. STUMPF'S\nDEPARTURE FROM WELLS FARGO IS A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR THE\nCOMPANY TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD?\n>> THANKS FOR THE QUESTION, WILFRED.\nJOHN CERTAINLY DID. I THINK JOHN'S DECISION TO\nRETIRE IS ONE THAT, YOU KNOW, IS CLEARLY SAD FOR ALL OF US AT\nWELLS FARGO, BECAUSE WE THINK SO HIGHLY OF JOHN AND HIS\nLEADERSHIP IN THE COMPANY OVER THE LAST DECADE.\nAND LONGER. BUT HE CONCLUDED THAT THIS WAS\nTHE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR THE COMPANY TO ALLOW IT TO MOVE\nFORWARD, BECAUSE HE FELT THAT THE FOCUS ON HIM WAS BECOMING A\nDISTRACTION AND HINDRANCE TO THE OPERATIONS OF THE BUSINESS.\n>> DO YOU FEEL SORRY FOR HIM? HAS HE BEEN MADE A SCAPEGOAT,\nEVEN THOUGH HE MADE THIS DECISION HIMSELF?\n>> WILFRED JOHN IS A FRIEND OF MINE, AND I HAVE BEEN PRIVILEGED\nTO WORK WITH HIM AND FOR HIM FOR A GOOD PORTION OF MY CAREER.\nSO THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT I FEEL SORRY FOR HIM.\nAND -- BUT HAVING SAID THAT, HE WOULDN'T WANT ANY OF US TO FEEL\nSORRY FOR HIM, BECAUSE HIS FIRST -- YOU KNOW, HIS FOCUS\nHERE WAS TO DO THE RIGHT THING FOR WELLS FARGO, AND THAT'S WHY\nHE DECIDED TO RETIRE. >> SO YOU SAID HE FELT IT A\nNECESSARY CONDITION. IS IT A SUFFICIENT CONDITION, IN\nYOUR EYES, OF THE COMPANY TO MOVE FORWARD?\nOR IS THERE MORE TO BE DONE? >> OH, THERE IS A LOT TO BE\nDONE. WELLS FARGO IS A COMPANY THAT'S\nMADE UP OF 268,000 TEAM MEMBERS, ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND ALL\nACROSS THE WORLD. AND NO ONE INDIVIDUAL IS\nNECESSARILY GOING TO MAKE THE DIFFERENCE.\nWE ALL HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO RESTORE THE REPUTATION OF THE\nCOMPANY, TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON MOVING THE COMPANY FORWARD.\nSO ONE PERSON, WHETHER IT'S JOHN STUMPF OR CANDIDLY, ME, IS NOT\nGOING TO MAKE THE DIFFERENCE. >> WITH THAT IN MIND, WHAT ARE\nYOU PLANNING TO DO, PERSONALLY? BECAUSE CLEARLY, IN THE EYES OF\nTHE PRESS AND LAWMAKERS, PARTICULARLY, NOT ENOUGH HAD\nBEEN DONE SO FAR. THERE WAS STILL A LOT OF\nPRESSURE ON YOU AS A COMPANY. WHAT MORE DO YOU PLAN TO DO THAT\nMR. STUMPF HASN'T YET? >> WELL, JOHN SET IN MOTION A\nSIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CHANGES, SOME OF WHICH WE HAVE ANNOUNCED,\nSPECIFIC, FOR EXAMPLE, IN OUR RETAIL BANKING BUSINESS, WE HAVE\nMADE SOME CHANGES IN TERMS OF OUR MANAGEMENT THERE.\nMARY MACK, WHO REPORTS TO ME IS HEAD OF THE COMMUNITY BANKING\nBUSINESS. WE HAVE MADE CHANGES IN TERMS OF\nOUR INCENTIVE SYSTEM. WE HAVE REACHED OUT TO OUR\nCUSTOMERS TO MAKE SURE THEY KNOW IF THEY HAVE ANY CONCERNS HOW\nTHEY CAN CONTACT US. WE HAVE REMEDIATED AND CORRECTED\nANY ERRORS THAT WE HAVE MADE FOR ANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS THAT WE'RE\nAWARE OF, AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON OUR\nCUSTOMERS AS WE HAVE FOR 164 YEARS TO BRING THEM THE BEST\nPRODUCTS AND SERVICE AND CONVENIENCE THAT WE CAN.\n>> WE EXPECT, OF COURSE, BOTH THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE TO\nSTILL PUSH FOR MORE ANSWERS. THEIR INVESTIGATIONS ARE NOT\nOVER YET. ARE YOU EXPECTING TO HAVE TO GO\nIN FRONT OF CONGRESS IN PLACE OF MR. STUMPF, WHO WAS GOING TO BE\nCALLED BACK? >> I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO\nTHAT, WILFRED. BUT YOU ARE CORRECT.\nTHERE HAVE BEEN SOME ADDITIONAL REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION BY BOTH\nTHE HOUSE AND THE SENATE. AND WE ARE CONTINUING TO COMPLY\nWITH PROVIDING THEM ANSWERS TO WHATEVER QUESTIONS THEY HAVE.\n>> DO YOU FEEL THE LAWMAKERS -- AT TIMES HAVE BEEN A BIT OVER\nTHE TOP, PARTICULARLY THAT SECOND HEARING AT TIMES WERE --\nWERE THINGS WERE SHOUTED AT MR.  THAN QUESTIONS ASKED?\n>> I THINK WE WERE DISAPPOINTED THAT THE HEARINGS TURNED INTO A\nSITUATION IN WHICH THERE WERE MORE SPEECHES GIVEN THAN\nQUESTIONS ASKED. BECAUSE WE FELT LIKE THERE WAS\nMORE ANSWERS THAT WE COULD HAVE PROVIDED.\nBUT, YOU KNOW, THOSE HEARINGS ARE OVER WITH, AND WE'RE MOVING\nON. >> MAY I JUST ASK, WHEN DID YOU\nPERSONALLY FIND OUT ABOUT THIS SCANDAL, CLEARING AS YOUR ROLE,\nHEAD OF BANKING. DID YOU FIND OUT AT THE SAME\nTIME MR. STUMPF IN 2013? >> YOU KNOW, WILFRED, THERE IS\nAN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION GOING ON ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD.\nAND I THINK -- AND I WANT TO BE VERY DEFERENTIAL TO THEIR\nPROCESS. >> SURE.\n>> I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT JOHN HAS MADE A VERY\nIMPORTANT DECISION FOR THE COMPANY TO RETIRE.\nAND I'M IN A NEW ROLE, AND WE'RE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD.\n>> MR. SLOAN, MY COLLEAGUE, MELISSA, IN THE STUDIO, HAS A\nQUESTION FOR YOU BEFORE -- A COUPLE CLOSING QUESTIONS.\n>> SURE, THAT'S FINE. >> TIM, JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON\nWILFRED'S POINT, DID THE FORMER HEAD OF RETAIL BANKING, CARRIE\nTOLSTEDT, DID SHE EVER REPORT DIRECTLY TO YOU?\n>> SHE DID. I WAS NAMED PRESIDENT AND CHIEF\nOPERATING OFFICER IN NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR, AND AT THAT POINT,\nCARRIE REPORTED DIRECTLY TO ME. >> I PRESUME YOU DID READ \"THE\nLOS ANGELES TIMES\" BACK IN 2013, SO YOU WERE AWARE OF WHAT WAS\nGOING ON ALLEGEDLY AT THE BANK. >> CORRECT.\nI RECALL THAT STORY. THAT'S CORRECT.\n>> DID YOU THINK THAT IT WAS SOMETHING THAT -- I MEAN, YOU'RE\nA 29-YEAR VETERAN AT WELLS FARGO, AND I ASK THIS QUESTION,\nMAINLY BECAUSE INVESTORS ARE WONDERING IF YOUR APPOINTMENT AS\nCEO DOES TURN THE PAINFUL  PAGE ON THE SCANDAL, TIM.\n>> I THINK THE ANSWER TO THAT IS WE'RE GOING TO DETERMINE IN A\nFEW MONTHS AND A FEW YEARS FROM NOW.\nI DON'T THINK ONE DAY OR AN HOUR AFTER THIS WAS ANNOUNCED THAT IS\nGOING TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. SO WE'LL SEE.\n>> MR. SLOAN, IF I JUMP BACK IN AGAIN, I SUPPOSE I WANTED TO ASK\nWHETHER YOU'RE HOPEFUL THAT THE EARNINGS THAT YOU'LL BE\nRELEASING ON FRIDAY WILL HELP YOU TO DRAW A LINE UNDER THE\nSHARE PRICE PRESSURE YOU'VE FELT.\nBECAUSE CLEARLY, THIS HAS BEEN A MASSIVE PR ISSUE FOR YOU, SO\nFAR. BUT DO YOU HOPE THAT FRIDAY WILL\nPROVE THIS ISN'T A NUMBERS AND EARNINGS ISSUE FOR YOU.\nOF. >> WELL, I DO.\nBUT I NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL, BECAUSE WE'RE TWO DAYS BEFORE WE\nANNOUNCE OUR EARNINGS, AND ANYIN TONATION IN MY VOICE OR\nEXCITEMENT OR DISAPPOINTMENT MAY LEAD ANYBODY TO CONCLUDE\nSOMETHING INAPPROPRIATE. YOU WILL FIND OUT FRIDAY\nMORNING. WE LOOK FORWARD TO TALKING TO\nOUR INVESTORS, JUST LIKE WE DO EVERY QUARTER.\n>> AND ONE -- TWO MORE FINAL QUESTIONS.\nIF THERE ARE FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS, PARTICULARLY\nINTO MR. STUMPF, POSSIBLY CRIMINAL, AS HAS BEEN CALLED FOR\nBY MR. SENATORS, DOES THE BANK'S OPTED DEPARTURE CAUSE YOU TO\nSTAND CLOSELY BY HIM, OR IS HE ON HIS OWN?\n>> I THINK THAT IS A TOPIC TO -- FOR THE BOARD TO REVIEW.\nI'M NOT AWARE OF ANY CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE GOING ON\nRIGHT NOW. TO MR. STUMPF.\n>> MY FINAL QUESTION FOR YOU, MR. SLOAN.\nYOU SAID IN A PRESS RELEASE IT WAS, QUOTE, A PRIVILEGE TO HAVE\nTHE OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST STORIED\nCOMPANIES. IS THIS A PROUD MOMENT FOR YOU\nOR A SAD MOMENT FOR YOU? >> IT'S A SAD -- THAT'S A VERY\nFAIR QUESTION. IT'S A SAD MOMENT, BECAUSE JOHN\nSTUMPF IS RETIRING IN A SITUATION THAT I THINK HE WOULD\nHAVE NEVER IMAGINED. AND HE HAS DONE SUCH A GREAT JOB\nIN MANAGING THIS COMPANY, NOTWITHSTANDING SOME OF THINGS\nTHAT I THINK HE WISHED HE WOULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY.\nTHAT'S WHAT MAKES IT SAD. HAVING SAID THAT, I FEEL A GREAT\nRESPONSIBILITY, AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING CEO OF THIS\nCOMPANY. WE HAVE AN AMAZING -- 164-YEAR\nHISTORY. AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO TO\nALLOW THE LAST FIVE WEEKS TO DEFINE THE SUCCESS -- THE FUTURE\nSUCCESS OF A VERY WELL REGARDED AND WELL KNOWN 164-YEAR-OLD\nCOMPANY. >> MR. SLOAN, THANK YOU VERY\nMUCH FOR YOUR TIME. WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE CALL.\nCONGRATULATIONS ON THE APPOINTMENT ALBEIT IN THOSE SAD\nCIRCUMSTANCES YOU MENTIONED. MR. SLOAN, CEO OF WELLS FARGO\nJOINING US. MELISSA, I'LL SEND IT BACK TO\nYOU. >> THANK YOU.\n>> TIM SLOAN, THE NEW CEO OF WELLS FARGO AND OF COURSE OUR\nOWN WILFRED FROST FOR BRINGING THAT EXCLUSIVE TO \"FAST MONEY.\"\nWHAT DO WE MAKE OF MR. SLOAN'S PERFORMANCE HERE?\n>> I THOUGHT HE WAS VERY DIPLOMATIC, AND I THOUGHT HE DID\nA NICE JOB, FRANKLY, OF NOT SELLING PEOPLE DOWN THE RIVER.\nI THINK IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT TIME, AND I THINK THE NEXT\nQUESTION ALSO -- I'M NOT SURE HOW HE ANSWERS THIS, BUT THIS IS\nIS KIND OF WHAT WAS ADDRESSED DOWN IN FRONT OF FOLKS IN\nWASHINGTON, IS THIS SOMETHING THAT'S ENDEMIC IN THE ENTIRE\nINDUSTRY? I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING PEOPLE\nWANT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF. >> I WOULD JUST SAY NAILED IT.\nDID CARRIE TOLSTEDT, THE WOMAN WHO RAN THE PHONY ACCOUNT UNIT,\nWAS SHE A DIRECT REPORT TO SLOAN?\nHE SAID YES. I BELIEVE IT'S NOT ENOUGH.\nTHESE GUYS ARE PROBABLY REALLY GOOD BANKERS, BUT THERE WAS A\nSCANDAL HERE, YOU KNOW? AND IN SOME WAYS THERE WAS\nPROBABLY SOME RELATIVELY CRIMINAL ACTIVITY.\nSO I'M NOT SURE HIM AS A REPLACEMENT IS THE PROPER\nREPLACEMENT. >> YOU GOT TO THINK IF HE GOES\nUP ON CAPITOL HILL, THE TONE AND TENOR OF THOSE QUESTIONS ARE\nGOING TO BE JUST AS -- >> AGGRESSIVE.\n>> -- FIERCE AND AGGRESSIVE AS THEY WERE THE FIRST TIME AROUND.\nIF WE'RE ASKING QUESTIONS WITHIN AN HOUR AFTER THE NEWS BREAKS,\nTHESE SENATORS, THESE CONGRESSPEOPLE HAVE DAYS, WEEKS\nTO PREPARE THEY'RE LINE OF QUESTIONING.\nYOU GOT TO THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE TEN TIMES HARDER.\n>> DOESN'T GO AWAY. I MEAN I DON'T THINK ANY OF US\nSAID IT'S GOING AWAY. WHAT I THINK A LOT OF US SAID IS\nIT'S ONE STEP CLOSER TO BEING RESOLVED, ALBEIT WE'RE STILL A\nLONG WAY AWAY. BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT FIRST\nSTEP, I BELIEVE. TO PETE'S POINT EARLIER, YOU\nCAN'T BLOW EVERYBODY OUT AND BRING IN A WHOLE NEW MANAGEMENT\nTEAM BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT WORKS EITHER.\nI THINK DAN MAKES A FAIR POINT. YOU'RE REPLACING A PERSON THAT'S\nBEEN THERE FOR DECADES WITH ANOTHER PERSON THAT'S BEEN THERE\nFOR THREE DECADES. DOES THAT SOLVE ANYTHING?\nNO. I DO THINK THEY'RE WORKING TO\nGET THEIR ARMS AROUND IT AND THE GUY WITHIN A HALF HOUR, 45\nMINUTES, THIS MAN IS WILLING TO COME ON AND DO AN INTERVIEW WITH\nWILFRED AND YOU. >> ALTHOUGH HE DID A PRETTY NICE\nJOB OF SORT OF SIDE STEPPING AROUND WHAT YOU WERE TALKING\nABOUT. AND I THINK THAT WAS THE RIGHT\nQUESTION TO ASK HIM RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE.\nWHO DID SHE REPORT TO? IT WAS HIM.\nSO YOU KIND OF GOT TO WONDER WHY OVER TIME THAT DIDN'T GET\nADDRESSED MUCH QUICKER THAN IT HAS NOW FINALLY.\nAND I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE AN OVERHANG.\nBUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE VERY STOP, THE TOP MAN WHO WAS IN",

WILFRED SPOKE TO NEW CEO TIM\nSLOAN IN AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW. HERE'S WHAT HE SAID ABOUT MOVING\nTHE COMPANY FORWARD. >> WELLS FARGO IS A COMPANY\nTHAT'S MADE UP OF 268,000 TEAM MEMBERS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY\nAND WORLD. NO ONE INDIVIDUAL IS NECESSARILY\nGOING TO MAKE THE DIFFERENCE. WE ALL HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO\nRESTORE THE REPUTATION OF THE COMPANY TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON\nMOVING THE COMPANY FORWARD. SO ONE PERSON IS NOT GOING TO\nMAKE THE DIFFERENCE. >> JOINING US NOW IS MIKE MAYO\nFROM CLSA. GOOD MORNING TO YOU.\nDOES THIS DO THE TRICK? WHAT IS THIS -- HOW DOES THIS\nCHANGE THE GAME? >> WELL, IT WELLS FARGO\nMOVE TO THE NEXT CHAPTER. THE OLD CHAPTER, I STILL CAN'T\nBELIEVE WHAT'S TAKEN PLACE IN THE LAST 34 DAYS SINCE WELLS\nFARGO HAD THE REGULATORY SETTLEMENT.\nTHEY STRUCK OUT LOOKING. THEY DIDN'T SWING THE BAT.\nI MEAN, THE APPEARANCE BEFORE THE BANKING COMMITTEE, BEFORE\nTHE HOUSE, THE REACTIONARY MANNER THEY BEHAVED IN, IT JUST\nMADE THE OLD CEO JOHN STUMPF A DISTRACTION.\nAND, YOU KNOW, WELLS FARGO IS BIGGER THAN THE CEO, BIGGER THAN\nANY ONE PERSON. TURN THE PAGE, NEW CHAPTER.\nMOVE AHEAD. >> THE QUESTION IS DOES THE PAGE\nREALLY GET TURNED OR ARE WE STILL GOING TO HEAR ABOUT THE\nDOJ, S.E.C., ARE THERE GOING TO BE CLAWBACKS PERHAPS ON JOHN\nSTUMPF'S INCOME FROM BEFORE? IS IT REALLY OVER?\n>> WELL, THEY ADDRESSED MANY OF THE CONCERNS I RAISED ON YOUR\nSHOWS A FEW WEEKS AGO. >> WHEN YOU RIPPED UP HIS\nTESTIMONY. >> WHAT WAS AMAZING ABOUT THAT,\nWHEN I RIPPED UP THE CEO'S TESTIMONY, I WOULD HAVE DONE THE\nSAME THING AFTER THE HEARING. THAT'S WHAT I MEAN ABOUT\nSTRIKING OUT BY NOT EVEN SWINGING THE BAT.\nLOOK AT WHAT WELLS FARGO HAS DONE SINCE THEN.\nTHEY DID CLAWBACK $41 MILLION FROM THE CEO.\nTHEY ARE NOW THE ONLY TOP 30 BANK WITH AN INDEPENDENT\nCHAIRMAN AND INDEPENDENT VICE CHAIRMAN.\nSO THEY'VE CHANGED THE BOARD. THEY'VE CHANGED SENIOR\nMANAGEMENT. AND WE THINK THEY'RE POISED FOR\nA PLAN \"B.\" AHEAD OF DELIVERY ON PAR WITH\nTHE HEAD OF COMMUNITY BANKING. I THINK THEY'RE POISSED FOR A\nPLAN \"B\" AT THE NEXT CHAPTER HERE.\n>> THAT'S YOUR POINT YOU'VE MADE IN A COUPLE OF NOTES RECENTLY.\nTHAT THERE COULD BE A POSITIVE -- NOT JUST FOR WELLS\nBUT FOR THE INDUSTRY -- OUT OF ALL OF THIS.\nTHEY USE IT AS AN EXCUSE TO SHUT DOWN SOME OF THE BRANCHES.\nMAYBE AREN'T AS NECESSARY TODAY IN THE HEAD COUNT WITHIN THEM AS\nIT WAS A DECADE AGO. >> WHY IS THE BANKING INDUSTRY\nNEEDING 87,000 BRANCHES? IF YOU TAKE THE LEVEL OF\nBRANCHES BACK TO THE 1950s, YOU'D HAVE A 40% REDUCTION IN\nBRANCHES. WELLS FARGO, THEY STILL HAVE\n6,000 BRANCHES. BANK OF AMERICA HAD 7,000 AND\nNOW THEY HAVE 4,700. WE THINK WELLS FARGO COULD\nREDUCE A THOUSAND BRANCHES. AS PAINFUL AS IT IS, THEY MIGHT\nREDUCE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES THERE.\nSO WHAT HAPPENED HERE IS WELLS FARGO'S REVENUES HAVEN'T GROWN\nTHIS DECADE. OKAY?\nREVENUES ARE STILL AROUND $89 BILLION.\nCOMMUNITY BANKING REVENUES HAVEN'T GROWN.\nTHEIR CROSS SELL DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE MUCH.\nRATHER THAN TRYING TO SQUEEZE BLOOD FROM A STONE, YOU SAY\nLET'S REDUCE THE NUMBER OF BRANCHES, EASE UP ON THE\nPRESSURE WE'RE PUTTING ON THE FRONT LINE EMPLOYEES, AND GET\nOUR EARNINGS GROWTH BY BECOMING MORE EFFICIENT.\n>> RIGHT. IS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT STUMPF\nIS A SCAPEGOAT FOR THE SORT OF LARGER ISSUE?\n>> WELL, YOU KNOW ABOUT THE FINANCIAL CRISIS.\nAND ANALYTICAL TERM IS TRANSFERENCE.\nSO I THINK WE HAVE COLLECTIVE TRANSFERENCE OF EMOTIONS.\nNO EXCUSES FOR HIM. BUT THE DEGREE OF THE REACTION,\nSPEED OF THE REACTION, MAGNITUDE OF IT I THINK RESULTS FROM\nLEFTOVER EMOTIONS. >> SHEILA BAIR TOLD US MUCH THE\nSAME THING A COUPLE WEEKS AGO. SHE THOUGHT HE WAS BEING A FALL\nGUY HERE. >> WELL, THERE'S NO EXCUSE.\nHE KNEW ABOUT THE PROBLEMS IN 2013 AND WELLS FARGO DIDN'T FIX\nTHIS PROBLEM. THAT'S STILL ONE QUESTION I\nHAVE. THE LAST 34 DAYS, THERE WAS NO\nCONFERENCE CALL FOR ANALYSTS. LOOK AT WHAT JAMIE DIMON DID.\nHE IMMEDIATELY HELD A CONFERENCE.\n>> WAS THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM IN A WEIRD WAY THE RESPONSE TO THE\nPROBLEM? >> WELL, THE PROBLEM ITSELF BUT ABSOLUTELY.\nTHIS IS THE WORST CRISIS MANAGEMENT I'VE SEEN IN MY THREE\nDECADES IN THE BANKING INDUSTRY. >> IF WE LOOK AT EARNINGS,\nCLEARLY DEFINED $185 MILLION FINE WAS TAKEN INTO THE Q2\nNUMBERS. ARE THERE GOING TO BE MORE\nNUMBERS RELATING TO THIS THAT WE HEAR ABOUT TOMORROW?\nOR IS THIS STILL JUST A PR ISSUE AND IT'S NOT GOING TO COME UP IN\nTHE NUMBERS TOMORROW? >> IT'S MORE THAN PR.\nREPUTATION IS VERY IMPORTANT. I THINK YOU'LL SEE THE BENEFITS\nOF WELLS FARGO BEING THE LARGEST MORTGAGE COMPANY AT A TIME WHEN\nMORTGAGE HAS PERFORMED BETTER. THEY MIGHT HAVE TO HAVE ONE OFF\nCHARGES HERE AND THERE. BUT WE THINK THE BASIS IS QUITE\nSTICKY. BUT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY.\nHERE'S MY SOLUTION OR ONE OF MANY SOLUTIONS.\nNEW CEO TIM SLOAN STAND UP THERE AND SAY WE'RE GOING TO MAKE 1\nMILLION PHONE CALLS TO EVERY IMPACTED CUSTOMER.\nWE'RE GOING TO GIVE $100 MILLION TO EVERY IMPACTED CUSTOMER.\nTHAT WOULD BE -- >> FOR EACH?\nTOTAL? >> $100 MILLION WOULD MATCH THE\nFINE THEY PAID THE CFPB. IT WOULD GIVE $1,000 TO EACH\nIMPACTED CUSTOMER THAT WAS CHARGED A FEE.\nTHEN YOU SAY 100% ACCOUNTABILITY GOING AHEAD.\nIF WE DO THIS AGAIN, YOU'LL GET QUADRUPLE THE CHARGES.\nTHEY'RE A GREAT MARKETING COMPANY BUT THEY'VE BEEN SILENT\nFOR THE LAST 35 DAYS. COME OUT THERE AND SWING THE BAT\nA FEW TIMES HERE. IT'S STALE GOOD COMPANY.\nBY THE WAY, CROSS SELLING IS OKAY IF DONE CORRECTLY.\nSAY WE HAVE GOOD BUSINESS AND IN RELATION TO THAT -- THEY NEED TO\nCOME OUT WITH A MORE POSITIVE MESSAGE.\nTHEY'VE BEEN QUIET THE LAST 35 DAYS.\n>> WHAT'S BEEN THE IMPACT ON THE OTHER BANKS WITH THINGS GOING ON\nAROUND THE CROSS SELLING BROADLY?\nYOU'RE SEEING MASSACHUSETTS AND OTHERS, NOW THEY THROW CROSS\nSELLING INTO ANY LAWSUIT. JUST THE PHRASE.\n>> I SAW THE CRUCIBLE ON BROADWAY A COUPLE WEEKS AGO, I\nHOPE IT'S NOT A WITCH HUNT. THEY HAD THE MOST FOCUSED CROSS\nSELLING CULTURE. IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE\nRESOURCES FOCUSED ON TRYING TO FIND THE NEXT BANK THAT DID\nTHIS, YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT MIGHT BE A WASTE OF TIME.\nLOOK. YOU NEVER HAVE A ZERO DEFECT\nRATE. WE DON'T WANT OUR BANKS TO\nFUNCTION FOR ZERO DEFECT. CLEARLY WELLS FARGO IS HIGH.\nTHEY SHOULD HAVE SHUT THAT DOWN SOONER.\nCAN YOU FIND ISOLATED CASES? I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING TO\nFIND ANYTHING CLOSE TO THIS MAGNITUDE.\n>> GOING INTO TOP EARNINGS SEASON, YOUR TOP PICK?\n>> WELL, LOOK. WELLS FARGO WITH THIS NICE\nDIVIDEND YIELD IS A NICE DEFENSIVE NAME ON A DAY LIKE\nTODAY. BUT CITIGROUP NEEDS TO TURN\nAROUND HERE AND THEY'RE TREATED LIKE IT'S STILL A FINANCIAL\nCRISIS AND IT'S NOT. WE STILL LIKE CITIGROUP HERE.\n>> BOTH AT 8:00 A.M. TOMORROW.

SO A LOT WE DON'T KNOW THERE\nOUTSIDE OF MAYBE PERSONAL FRUSTRATION BUT IT WOULD HINT AT\nMAYBE A DISTURBANCE OR A FIGHT BETWEEN THE CREW.\nSO MUCH WE DON'T KNOW, BUT YOU DO THEN, STEPPING BACK FROM\nTHIS, HAVE TO WONDER ABOUT PRIVATE AIRCRAFT, RIGHT?\n>> WELL, YOU DO. WE'VE HAD TO WORRY ABOUT PRIVATE\nAIRCRAFT GOING BACK A LONG TIME AND CERTAINLY, YOU KNOW, WITH\n9/11 AS A TRIGGERING POINT. BUT YOU RECALL SOMETIME BACK A\nPRIVATE PILOT IN TEXAS TOOK UP HIS OWN PERSONAL PLANE AND FLEW\nIT INTO AN IRS BUILDING AND DID GREAT DAMAGE, KILLED HIMSELF AND\nKILLED AN EMPLOYEE IN THAT FACILITY.\nTHAT WAS ON ITS FACE A SUICIDE. YOU KNOW, IT DOES SHOW THE HARM\nTHAT CAN BE DONE WITH THESE SMALL AIRCRAFT, PARTICULARLY IF\nTHEY'RE LOADED UP WITH FUEL. BUT IT'S CURIOUS TO ME BECAUSE\nHERE IS SOMEBODY WHO WAS LICENSED TO FLY I BELIEVE A\nSINGLE-ENGINE PLANE. HE COULD HAVE DONE A HECK OF A\nLOT MORE DAMAGE THAN WAS DONE HERE.\nWAS THE DAMAGE MITIGATED BY THE ACTION OF THE LICENSED PILOT WHO\nWAS FIGHTING HIM OFF AND THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THIS 200 YARD\nHAR GIN TO PRATT AND WHITNEY. IS PRATT AND WHITNEY REALLY A\nVIABLE TARGET? IS THIS SUICIDE?\nIS THIS EMPLOYMENT FRICTION? IS IT SOMETHING ELSE?\nWE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE.\n>> PRATT AND WHITNEY ALSO A MAJOR MILITARY AIRCRAFT MAKER ON\nTOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE. A LOT WE DON'T KNOW, RON.\nTHANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE'LL MONITOR THAT PRESS\nCONFERENCE. IF ANYTHING SIGNIFICANT COMES\nALONG, WE'LL LET YOU KNOW, BUT OBVIOUSLY SOME SCARY\nDEVELOPMENTS SINCE YESTERDAY WHEN THIS CRASH WAS FIRST\nREPORTED AND IT DOES OPEN UP, YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY SOME\nDISTURBING POSSIBILIPOSSIBILITI.",

IT WAS A MOTHER AND HER THREE\nDAUGHTERS AGE 17, 15, AND 5. ALL HAVE BEEN RELEASED FROM THE\nHOSPITAL AND OTHER THAN BEING CLEARLY SHAKEN BY THE INCIDENT\nTHEY'RE OTHERWISE DOING ALL RIGHT.\nAS FAR AS THE SCENE HERE ON MAIN STREET, WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE\nMIGHT BE ABLE TO OPEN IT AS SOON AS LATER THIS EVENING.\nIT'S IN THE FINAL STAGES OF EVIDENCE COLLECTION, AND THE\nPOWER COMPANY NATURALLY NEEDS TO COME IN AND FINISH DOING SOME OF\nTHEIR UPDATES AND CORRECTIONS TO THE POWER GRID IN THAT AREA.\nDEP IS ALSO ON SCENE FINISHING SOME OF THE HAZMAT CLEANUP.\nONCE THAT'S CLEAR WE CAN OPEN UP MAIN STREET AND TRY TO GET\nTHINGS BACK TO NORMAL.

BUT I WANT TO BE CRYSTAL CLEAR.\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND THAT ARE STILL BEING INVESTIGATED.\nCIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND THE CRASH AS FAR AS WHO WAS THE PILOT,\nWHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE THAT LED TO IT BEING INTENTIONAL, ALL\nWINDOWS ARE OPEN AT THIS POINT. THERE'S NO CLEAR INDICATION AS\nFAR AS ANY MOTIVE. THIS IS STILL EARLY IN THE\nINVESTIGATION AT THIS POINT. THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE\nON THAT, SO WE'RE NOT DRAWING ANY CONCLUSIONS IN ANY WAY,\nSHAPE, OR FORM AT THIS POINT. IT DOES APPEAR TO BE\nINTENTIONAL, BUT BEYOND THAT THE INVESTIGATION IS CONTINUING.\nTHERE HAS BEEN SOME INFORMATION THAT WAS RELEASED EARLIER\nINDICATING THAT THE FBI WAS THE LEAD INVESTIGATOR IN THIS.\nTHERE'S BEEN SOME UPDATES WITH THAT.\nIT IS STILL A JOINT INVESTIGATION BETWEEN THE FBI\nAND THE NTSB IN COOPERATION WITH NATURALLY THE EAST HARTFORD\nPOLICE DEPARTMENT, CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE, THE FAA AND OUR\nPARTNER AGENCIES. MAIN STREET IS STILL CLOSED AT\nTHIS POINT BUT WE ANTICIPATE BEING ABLE TO OPEN IT IN THE\nNEAR FUTURE.

THE CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND IT\nBEING DETERMINED -- IT APPEARS -- EXCUSE ME, INTENTION,\nI CAN'T COMMENT. NOTHING IS OFF THE TABLE AT THIS\nPOINT. >> HOW ABOUT TERRORISM?\n>> I'M SORRY? >> CAN YOU CONFIRM WHETHER\nYOU'RE INVESTIGATING SOME SORT OF ARGUMENT MIDAIR BETWEEN THE\nSTUDENT AND THE FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR?\n>> I CAN'T CONFIRM THOSE DETAILS AT THIS TIME.\nNOTHING IS OFF THE TABLE AT THIS POINT.\n>> CAN YOU GIVE US AN INDICATION OF WHAT IT LEADS YOU TO CONCLUDE\nTHAT -- >> I CAN'T PROVIDE THOSE\nSPECIFIC DETAILS AT THIS TIME.

THEY'RE GETTING THAT FROM THE\nPILOT OF THAT PLANE. THE CO-PILOT, 28-YEAR-OLD FERRIS\nWHO ENTERED THE U.S. IN 2012 ON AN M-1 VISA WAS STARTING TO GET\nFLYING LESSONS AND THEN ACQUIRED AN F-1 VISA FOR LANGUAGE SCHOOL.\nTHERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT EITHER THE PILOT OR THE CO-PILOT\nHAD AN ARGUMENT BUT THE SURVIVING PILOT SAID THIS WAS INTENTIONAL.\nTHERE'S NOTHING MORE THE AUTHORITIES CAN SAY ABOUT\nWHETHER THAT FIGHT OR DISAGREEMENT IF IT EVEN AMOUNTED\nTO THAT PROMPTED THE CRASH ITSELF OR WHETHER PRATT AND\nWHITNEY, WHICH WAS LITERALLY 200 YARDS AWAY FROM THE CRASH SITE A\nMAJOR AIRCRAFT MAKER, PARTICULARLY MILITARY AIRCRAFT\nMAKER WAS THE TARGET. NO WAY TO TELL.\nIT IS STILL EARLY.

SHE SAID SHE INTRODUCED HERSELF\nTO TRUMP OUTSIDE OF AN ELEVATOR. HE KISSED HER ON THE CHEEK AND\nTHEN FULL, DIRECTLY ON THE MOUTH.\nIT SOUNDS FAMILIAR TO WHAT DONALD TRUMP BOASTS ABOUT ON THE\n\"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD\" HOT MIKE TAPE.\nLISTEN TO THAT. >> MAYBE DIFFERENT ONE.\n>> BETTER NOT BE. IT'S HER.\n>> THAT'S HER. WITH THE GOLD.\nI GOT TO USE SOME TIC-TACS IN CASE I START KISSING HER.\nI'M AUTOMATICALLY ATTRACTED TO BEAUTIFUL.\nI JUST START KISSING AND WHEN YOU ARE A STAR YOU CAN DO IT.\nTHEY LET YOU DO ANYTHING. GRAB THEM BY THE PUSSY.\nDO ANYTHING. >> ALL YOU CAN SEE IS THE LEGS.\n>> LOOKS GOOD. >> OH, NICE LEGS.\n>> GET OUT OF THE WAY. .\n>> WHAT IS INTERESTING, IT STARTINGLY CLOSE TO WHAT HE SAYS\nON THE TAPE AND WHAT THESE WOMEN SAY HAPPENED.\nHOW DOES THIS AFFECT THE RATINGS.\n>> ONE THING DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO DO.\nHE HAS THE CORE SUPPORT HE HAS HAD.\nHE THINK THIS IS THE MEDIA OUT TO GET HIM.\n>> WE CAN SAY IT IS NOT. ONE OF THESE WOMEN TOLD THE\nSTORY TO FRIENDS RIGHT AFTER IT HAPPENED DECADES AGO.\n>> EXACTLY. >> SO WHAT WE SAW IS AFTER THAT\nTAPE THAT WE WATCHED CAME OUT WE SAW A COUPLE OF POLLS THAT\nDAMAGED DONALD TRUMP WITH WOMEN. FOR EXAMPLE A POLL SUGGESTED HE\nDROPPED 24 POINTS WITH WOMEN BETWEEN THURSDAY AND THE WEEKEND\nBECAUSE THE TAPE. WE SAW HIM BUILD THAT UP IN PART\nBECAUSE HE DENIED THE ALLEGATIONS.\n>> SAME EFFECT. >> SO, DONALD TRUMP HAS THIS\nCORE BASE OF SUPPORT. HE'S TRIED TO EXPAND IT WITHOUT\nSUCCESS. WOMEN WHO ARE MODERATE\nREPUBLICANS, WHITE COLLEGE EDUCATED WOMEN HAVE BEEN\nSKEPTICAL OF DONALD TRUMP IF THEY WERE GIVING HIM A THIRD\nCHANCE AFTER WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE DEBATE.\n>> IT IS BECAUSE SO MANY WOMEN EXPERIENCED THE BEHAVIOR THESE\nWOMEN ARE DESCRIBING, NOT FROM DONALD TRUMP BUT IN THEIR\nDAY-TO-DAY LIVES, SOMETIMES DECADES AGO AND SOMETIMES MORE\nRECENTLY. SOME WOMEN HAVE NEVER TOLD\nPEOPLE ABOUT IT. IF YOU WERE TO CONDUCT A POLL OF\nAMERICAN WOMEN, MOST WOULD SAY THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED HARASSMENT\nVERBALLY OR PHYSICALLY. >> SOME MEN MAY NOT BE AWARE.\nSOME MEN ARE BUT -- >> DONALD TRUMP'S REACTION TO\nTHE \"NEW YORK TIMES\" WAS TO YELL AT THE FEMALE REPORTER.\n>> I WANT TO GET HIS REACTION. WHAT IS THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN\nSAYING ABOUT THE NEW ALLEGED INCIDENTS?\n>> THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN CAME OUT WITH A STATEMENT DENIES THE\nALLEGATIONS AND CALL IT ENTIRELY FALSE.\nTHEY BELIEVE THE REPORTS ARE POLITICALLY MOTIVATED.\nI WANT TO READ YOU JASON MILLER, SENIOR COMMUNICATIONS ADVISER\nFOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, HIS ENTIRE STATEMENT.\nHE SAID \"FOR THE \"NEW YORK TIMES\" TO LAUNCH A FALSE\nCOORDINATED CHARACTER ASSASSINATION ON MR. TRUMP ON A\nTOPIC LIKE THIS IS DANGEROUS. TO REACH BACK DECADES IN AN\nATTEMPT TO SMEAR MR. TRUMP TRIVIALIZES SEXUAL ASSAULT.\nAND IT SETS A NEW LOW FOR WHERE THE MEDIA IS WILLING TO GO IN\nITS EFFORTS. IT IS ABSURD TO THINK THAT ONE\nOF THE MOST RECOGNIZABLE BUSINESS LEADERS ON THE PLANET\nWITH A STRONG RECORD OF EMPOWERING WOMEN WOULD DO THIS\nIS RIDICULOUS. FURTHER THE TIMES STORY BURIES\nTHE PRO CLINTON FINANCIAL AND SOCIAL MEDIA ACTIVITY ON BEHALF\nOF HILLARY CLINTON'S CANDIDACY, REINFORCING THIS TRULY IS\nNOTHING MORE THAN A POLITICAL ATTACK.\nAND HE ENDS SAYING, THIS IS A SAD DAY FOR THE TIMES.\nOF COURSE, AS BRIAN NOTED EARLIER, TRUMP ON TUESDAY NIGHT\nIN TALKING TO THE \"NEW YORK TIMES\" REPORTER ACCORDING TO THE\n\"NEW YORK TIMES\" SAYS NONE OF THIS TOOK PLACE IS WHAT HE TOLD\nHER. >> EITHER BLAME THE MEDIA AND\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN. I WILL GET TO JEFF ZELENY IN A\nMOMENT ABOUT WHAT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS SAYING.\nWHY ARE YOU SHAKING YOUR HEAD? >> PARTICULARLY THE POINT\nSOMEONE SO RECOGNIZABLE WOULD DO THIS.\nIN THE ERA OF BILL COSBY THAT'S A BAD DEFENSE.\nWE SAW WOMEN SIT FOR DECADES UNCOMFORTABLE TALKING ABOUT WHAT\nHAPPENED WITH BILL COSBY. DONALD TRUMP TWEETED WITH BILL\nCOSBY. SAYING IF HE IS NOT TALKING HE\nCAN'T BE INNOCENT. THAT'S THE PARALLEL.\nAS SOON AS I HEAR THAT IT IS 2016.\nTHAT'S NO LONGER THE CASE. >> COSBY AND ROGER AILES, WHO IS\nA LONG-TIME FRIEND OF DONALD TRUMP AND ADVISER OF DONALD\nTRUMP WHO MAY BE GIVING HIM ADVICE ABOUT THIS.\nHE'S BEEN ACCUSED BY 20 WOMEN OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT.\n>> CLINTON CAMPAIGN, WHAT'S THEIR RESPONSE?\nARE THEY SAYING ANYTHING? >> HILLARY CLINTON WAS FLYING TO\nLAS VEGAS WHERE I AM NOW. SHE WILL BE HOLDING A RALLY ANY\nMOMENT FLYING HERE FROM COLORADO EARLIER THIS EVENING WHEN THIS\nREPORT CAME ACROSS. I'M TOLD SHE DID READ THIS\nREPORT AND SHE WAS SHOCKED BY IT, LIKE MANY OTHER PEOPLE WERE.\nWE HAVE A STATEMENT FROM HER COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR,\nJENNIFER PAUL MARY WHO I TALKED TO A SHORT WHILE AGO.\nIT SAYS THIS DISTURBING STORY SADLY FITS EVERYTHING WE KNOW\nABOUT THE WAY DONALD TRUMP HAS TREATED WOMEN.\nTHESE REPORTS SUGGEST HE LIED ON THE DEBATE STAGE AND THE\nDISGUSTING BEHAVIOR HE BRAGGED ABOUT ON THE TAPE IS MORE THAN\nJUST WORDS. THAT'S A COMMUNICATION FROM HER\nCOMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR. I AM TOLD HE DOESN'T PLAN TO\nADDRESS IT AT THE RALLY OR IN THE COMING DAYS NECESSARILY.\nBUT WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO GET THEIR HANDS AROUND HERE IS THAT,\nYOU KNOW, THIS IS A DIFFERENT MOMENT AND PHASE OF THE\nCAMPAIGN. WITH EVERY NEW THING THAT\nHAPPENS, THEY ARE ACTUALLY WORRIED ABOUT THIS BECOMING A\nSCORCHED EARTH CAMPAIGN, IN SECRETARY CLINTON'S WORDS THAT\nWILL DEPRESS VOTER TURNOUT AT ALL.\nTHEY ARE WATCHING IT CAREFULLY. THIS REPORT IN THE TIMES, AS\nWELL AS OTHER REPORTS IN NEWSPAPERS, IN OTHER PARTS OF\nTHE COUNTRY TONIGHT ABOUT ALLEGATION AGAINST DONALD TRUMP.\nTHIS IS JUST BEGINNING WITH SOME 27 DAYS TO GO IN THIS CAMPAIGN.\n>> JOHN PODESTA SAID HE BELIEVES IT IS AN EFFORT TO SUPPRESS THE\nVOTE, BY GOING TO THE BOTTOM. BRIAN MENTIONED ONE OF THE\nALLEGED INCIDENTS, ONE IN 2005 THAT WASN'T REPORTED TO THE\nPOLICE OR PRESS, BUT THEY TOLD OTHERS A THE TIME.\nDOES THAT HELP TO CORROBORATE THEIR STORY?\n>> I THINK IT DOES. THE \"NEW YORK TIMES\" APPARENTLY\nSPOKE TO SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAD SPOKEN TO THESE WOMEN\nCONTEMPORANEOUSLY. ONE WOMAN SAID AS TRUMP'S\nCAMPAIGN PROGRESSED SHE STARTED TO TELL THE STORY MORE AND MORE.\nTHE IDEA THIS IS SOMEHOW COORDINATED BY THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN OR THE MEDIA,ER THE \"WASHINGTON POST\" WAS LEAKED\nTHIS SNIPPET OF VIDEO FROM NBC. IT CAME UP AT THE DEBATE.\nWOMEN SAW HIS RESPONSE AT THE DEBATE.\nTHEY RESPONDED BY REACHING OUT TO THE MEDIA.\nTHAT'S THE STORY THAT MAKES SENSE.\n>> THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.\n>> I HAVE LIMIT TIME. IS HE THREATENING TO SUE THE\n\"NEW YORK TIMES\"? DIDN'T HE THREATEN A REPORTER ON\nTHE PHONE. >> ON THE PHONE HE THREATENED A\nLAWSUIT. >> WHAT ARE THEY SAYING.\n>> THERE IS A LAWSUIT BEING DRAFTED RIGHT NOW.\nI HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR COMMENT BUT THEY HAVEN'T CONFIRMED IT.\nIF THEY DO SUE IT WOULD OPEN TRUMP UP TO DISCOVERY.\nIT WOULD BE SURPRISING IF HE WOULD WANT TO DO THAT.\nTHE \"NEW YORK TIMES\" SAYS THEY ARE ON SOLID GROUND AND THE\nSTORY WAS NEWSWORTHY. >> THE \"NEW YORK TIMES\"\nREPORTING THAT TWO WOMEN ARE ACCUSING DONALD TRUMP OF\nINAPPROPRIATE TOUCHING.

IT IS GOING TO LEAD TO MORE\nDISTRUST TOWARD MAIN STREAM MEDIA.\nAND I THINK THEY'RE HOPING TO GET MORE TAPES ON TRUMP SO THEY\nCAN TAKE THE SPOT HEIGHT OFF THEMSELVES.\nAS USUAL, THE FINGERS ARE POINTED PACK.\n>> THE OTHER THING IS SHE ADMITS SHE IS ONE PERSON IN PUBLIC AND\nA TOTALLY DIFFERENT PERSON BEHIND THE SCENES.\nAND FOR EXAMPLE SHE SUPPORTS OPEN TRADE.\nSHE WANTS AN OPEN HEMISPHERE. SEX HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE CAN\nCOME IN HERE SHELF HAS FRIENDS EVERYWHERE COVERING UP FOR HER.\nSHE HAS A PUBLIC POSITION AND A PRIVATE POSITION SHELF SUPPORTS\nFRACTIONING, SHE DOESN'T SUPPORT FRACKING.\nSHE SUPPORTS KEYSTONE, SHE DOESN'T SUPPORT KEYSTONE.\nIT IS THE PROPAGANDA AND I DON'T KNOW IF THE PUBLIC CAN ABSORB\nIT. THE MOST IMPORTANT THEY KNOW IS\nTO NOT REPORT IT AT ALL. IF AN IMPORTANT STORY HAPPENS\nAND THE PRESS IGNORES IT, DID IT ACTUALLY HAPPEN?\nFOR EXAMPLE WE'VE JUST SEEN FIVE SEPARATE WIKILEAKS DOCUMENT\nDUMPS IN THE LAST 24 HOURS. SOME OF THEM DEEPLY REVEALING.\nYOU GO ON THE \"WASHINGTON POST\" WEBSITE, ONE OF THE MOST\nIMPORTANT PAPERS IN THE WORLD AND THERE ARE NO STORIES ABOUT\nIT ON THE FRONT PAGE. THE ONLY STORY THAT EVEN REFERS\nTO IT IS THE UTTERLY CAMPAIGN THAT THIS IS PART OF A RUSSIAN\nPROPAGANDA EFFORT. THEY DON'T KNOW IF IT IS TRUE.\nTHAT'S THE ONLY THING. OVER AT VOX, A VERY HIGHLY\nVALUED WILL HE BE RAL NEWS SITE. THERE ARE NO STORIES OTHER THAN\nJOHN PODESTA'S STORY. ALL THE REST, COMPLETELY\nIGNORED. THE PRESS BY DOING IT DEVALUES\nITS OWN CURRENCY. THIS WILL BE OVER IN A MONTH.\nWHERE WILL THEY BE THEN? THIS HURTS THEM.\nTHIS IS SHORT SIGHTED AND DUMB AND I THINK IT IS THE BEGINNING\nOF THE END OF THE OLD MEDIA ORDER.\n>> YOU'RE RIGHT. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE TRUST\nTHOSE OUTLETS. POOR CHELSEA CLEANSE HAD ENOUGH\nSENSE TO REALIZE THE SIGNIFICANCE AND SERIOUSNESS OF\nTHE PAY TO PLAY AND ACCESS TO HER MOTHER WHEN SHE WAS\nSECRETARY OF STATE. SHE WAS CALLED THE SPOILED BRAT\nFOR REVEALING IT. THEN WITH THE MONEY THEY WERE\nRAISING FOR THE CLINTON FOUNDATION FOR HAITI, THEY'RE\nLITERALLY SEPARATING OUT THE CLINTON DONORS AND FRIENDS OF\nBILL TO GIVE THEM ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE MONEY.\n>> THIS IS WHAT ALL OF US THOUGHT ALL ALONG.\nWHEN THE CLINTON FOUNDATION RAN DOWN TO DO ALL THAT WORK IN\nHAITI, AND MUCH OF IT HAS BEEN CALLED INTO QUESTION.\nHOW IS THIS ALL WORKING? AND IT TURNS OUT ON A FEW\nOCCASIONS, AND I IMAGINE THIS IS THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG.\nTHE OTHER ISSUE I THOUGHT AS A ROMAN CATHOLIC I FOUND TO BE SO\nDISTURBING IS THE JENNIFER PALMIERI COMMENT AND THE PODESTA\nCOMMENT ABOUT CATHOLICS. ESPECIALLY MORE TRADITIONAL\nCATHOLICS LIKE MYSELF. THEY DIDN'T MENTION PEEL BY\nNAME. THE MOST DERICIVE AND DISMISSIVE\nAND NASTY COMMENTS. >> THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT\nINFILTRATING THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WITH LEFT WING IDEOLOGY.\nGET THIS. TO FOMENT REVOLUTION.\nWHO THINKS LIKE THIS UNLESS YOU'RE A MARXIST DISCIPLE.\n>> WE KNOW, WE MERGED HILLARY HATES EVERY DAY AMERICANS\nBETWEEN PODESTA AND PALMIERI. WE KNOW, TUCKER, THEY SAID I\nKNOW SHE'S BEGUN TO HATE EVERYDAY AMERICANS.\nBUT I THINK WE SHOULD USE IT ONCE.\nWE TALK ABOUT INFILTRATING THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.\nAND THEY KNEW THAT SAUDI ARABIA AND QATAR ARE FUNDING ISIS.\nSHE STILL TOOK THEIR MONEY. >> WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING?\nIT'S NOT FUNNY. >> IT IS EVERY SUSPICION YOU\nEVER HAD. I WONDER WHAT THEY'RE TALKING\nABOUT OVER THIS AT THE CENTRAL FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS.\nTHEIR FIGHTING ABOUT MOAN BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL GETTING\nRICH. >> THEY'RE ATTACKING NORMAL\nPEOPLE. RELIGIOUS PEOPLE.\nPEOPLE OF FAITHFUL AND THEY'RE ALSO BASICALLY LYING ABOUT THEIR\nMOTIVATIONS, ABOUT EVERYTHING. AND NOW WE RIP OFF THE COVERS\nAND IT TURNS OUT TO ALL BE TRUE. >> IT'S ABOUT, AS IT ALWAYS IS\nABOUT WITH THE CLINTONS. IT IS ABOUT POWER AND IT IS\nABOUT MONEY. THEY HAVE A LOT OF MONEY.\nALMOST $170 MILLION. THEY ALWAYS WANT TO HOLD ON TO\nTHE POWER AND THEY DOLE OUT THE GOODIES TO THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN\nGOOD OVER THE YEARS. >> WE'LL THINK ABOUT THIS.\n>> YOU HAVE THE REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT, THE THE\nCONTRACTIC ESTABLISHMENT, THE MEDIA ESTABLISHMENT AGAINST\nTHEM, EVEN THE U.N. ESTABLISHMENT, GLOBALIST\nESTABLISHMENT. CAN ANYBODY OVERCOME THAT UNITED\nGROUP OF POWER? IF THEY'RE ALL OPPOSING YOU?\nIT IS NOT EASY. >> NO.\nTHAT'S WHY MOST PEOPLE BECOME MEMBERS OF THE ESTABLISHMENT.\nIT IS A LOT EASIER. AND YOU GO TO BETTER PARTIES.\nI DON'T LIKE THOSE PARTIES ANYWAY SO IT NEVER BOTHERED ME.\nHE WILL HAVE A HEART TO HEART. IF ANYBODY CAN DO IT, I THINK HE\nCAN. HE IS SWINGING FOR THE FENCES.\nHE NOW HAS TO BRING ALL OF THIS TOGETHER.\nI THINK IT IS TIME TO GO BACK TO THE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES HE\nWENT TO IN AUGUST. >> TUCKER, NICE OF YOU TO COME\nBACK. >> ARE YOU KIDDING?\nI LOVE IT. >> YOU'VE BEEN MIA.\n>> I'VE BEEN TRYING TO ELBOW MY",

DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT.\nSHE BRAGGED ABOUT THIS. THE 2013 WALL STREET SPEECH\nWHERE SHE MADE A LOT OF MONEY. THE CLINTONS HAVE MADE IT CHEER\nTHEY DON'T CARE MUCH FOR THE AVERAGE EVERYDAY AMERICANS.\nBUT FIRST THE RELEASED E-MAILS REVEAL MAJOR CONTRIBUTIONS FROM\nHILLARY ON KEY POLICIES AND TOPICS.\nSHE SAID SHE WANTS A 550% INCREASE OF SYRIAN MIGRANTS\nCOMING INTO AMERICA. BUT ACCORDING TO A SPEECH SHE\nACTUALLY ADMITTED WHAT DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN SAYING.\nTHAT REFUGEES CANNOT BE PROPERLY VETTED AND COULD PUT COUNTRIES\nTHEY ENTER AT RISK. IS SHE WILLING TO GAMBLE WITH\nYOUR LIFE? IS THAT WHAT SHE'S SAYING?\nSHE SAID SHE WANTS A NO-FLY ZONE IN YEARS.\nI CAN'T BUT THE E-MAIL SAYS SHE WAS SKEPTICAL ABOUT IT DURING A\nSPEECH TO GOLDMAN SACHS. AND SHE WAS ALSO UNSURE ABOUT\nSUPPORTING OR OPPOSING THE KEY STONE PIPELINE.\nNOW BEING A SO-CALLED CHAMPION OF CLIMATE CHANGE.\nSHE IS A FIERCE CRITIC OF BIG BANKS BUT SHE PRAISED THE\nACTIONS. SHE FAVORED A MAN THAT WOULD CUT\nSOCIAL SECURITY. AND SHE SAID THE OPPOSITE TO YOU\nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND CLINTON SUPPORTED OPEN\nBORDERS AND OPEN TRADE. SHE SAID SHE WOULD LIKE THE SEE\nTHE U.S. MOVE TOWARD A SOCIALIZED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM\nJUST LIKE WHAT THEY HAVE IN CANADA.\nSINGLE PAYER. BUT THERE ARE ISSUES ABOUT HOW\nTHE CLINTONS REALLY FEEL ABOUT YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\nNOW WIKILEAKS UNCOVERED THAT CLINTON HATED USING THE PHRASE\nEVERY DAY AMERICANS DURING SPEECHES AND SHE WAS FAR REMOVED\nFROM THE STRUGGLES OF THE MIDDLE WHICH IS A.\nHER CAMPAIGN SPOKESWOMAN VICIOUSLY ATTACKED AND MOCKED\nCATHOLICS. AND THE CLINTON ACTIVIST ASKED\nJOHN PODESTA, WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE PEOPLE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE?\nTHIS WAS JUST BEFORE CLINTON LOST THE PRIMARY TO BERNIE\nSANDERS SHELF ALSO REFERRED TO THEY WILL AS A BASKET OF\nDEPLORABLES. HERE'S WHAT TRUMP SAID\nYESTERDAY. >> IT IS WHAT I GREW UP IN.\nI'M BASICALLY YOUR STANDARD RED NECK.\n>> THE CONTROL OF OF CROWD PACK, THE ADVISER TO DAVID CAMERON.\nAND FROM THE AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION.\nTHE CHAIRMAN. I WANT TO ASK YOU IN THE\nCONTEXT, I LOOK AT THE POLLS. WE DON'T HAVE POLLING POST\nSECOND DEBATE. WE DON'T HAVE POLLING POST\nWIKILEAKS. SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE POLL\nNUMBERSFUL ARE NOBODY KNOWS. YOU WENT THROUGH THIS WITH\nBREXIT. DO YOU SEE SIMILARITIES?\n>> THERE ARE SO MANY SIMILARITIES.\nONE OF THEM IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING HERE WHICH IS THE\nCOMPLETE UNITY OF THE ESTABLISHMENT.\nTHE MEDIA ESTABLISHMENT. THE POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT.\nTHEY SAID IF YOU SUPPORT LEAVE, YOU'RE DEAN IS PHONETIC AND\nYOU'RE A RACIST AND YOU HAVE TO BE ON THE SIDE OF THE EU.\nYET THE PEOPLE REJECTED THAT AND THEY SAID NO, WE'RE SICK AND\nTIRED OF BEING TOLD WHAT TO THINK.\nA LOT OF TIME PEOPLE WOULDN'T ADMIT.\n>> WHAT WAS THE DISPARITY IN THE POLLS?\n>> JUST BEFORE THE VOTE. EVEN ON THE DAY.\nTHEY WERE PREDICTING. DAVID CAMERON HIMSELF WAS GIVEN\nA PREDICTION ON THE DAY OF THE VOTE THAT HE WOULD WIN BY ABOUT\n5 POINTS. IT TURNED OUT TO BE THE OTHER\nWAY. HE WAS REALLY FAR OFF.\nTHE OTHER THEY KNOW IS THE TOTAL CYNICISM OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN\nWASHINGTON AND WITH THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN.\nAND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WILL REALLY GET PEOPLE\nFIRED UP AND ANGRY. AND AS LONG AS THE FOCUS CAN BE\nON THAT, I THINK THERE'S EVERYTHING TO MAY FOR.\n>> THERE ARE THOSE SIMILARITIES. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY\nESTABLISHMENT, THEY'RE AGAINST TRUMP.\nEVERY DEMOCRAT, THEY'RE AGAINST TRUMP.\nWE JUST EXPOSED THAT. YOU HAVE EVEN THE U.N.\nI MEAN, YOU HAVE EVERY SINGLE MAJOR CONGLOMERATE POWER BROKER\nAT EVERY LEVEL NOW AGAINST DONALD TRUMP.\nJUST LIKE BEFORE THE BREXIT VOTE.\nDID YOU THINK THERE WAS THEIR WOULD BE A WE KNOW IS IN THE\nPOLLS? >> I THINK YOU'RE SWIT.\nBE VERY DUBIOUS ABOUT WHAT WAS RELEASED AND THE WELL\nORCHESTRATED TAKE DROP. AND I THINK IT WAS A GANG BUSTER\nDEBATE PERFORMANCE. WHAT HILLARY CLINTON IS\nREMINDING US IS THE DISDAIN FOR THE AVERAGE WORKING PERSON IN\nTHIS COUNTRY. WHEN YOU PUT IT ALL TOGETHER, I\nDON'T THINK YOU CAN TRUST THESE NUMBER FOR SEVERAL DAYS TO COME.\nMAYBE A WEEK OR SO. >> DO YOU THINK IN 27 DAYS, THIS\nLEVEL OF CONTEMPT, THE EXPOSURE OF CORRUPTION AND COLLUSION\nBETWEEN THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN AND THE MEDIA, THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN\nAND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN AND THE\nWHITE HOUSE THE LET'S TAKE ONE POSITION PRIVATELY.\nDO YOU THINK PEOPLE ABSORB ALL THIS IN TIME?\n>> I WORRY ABOUT THAT, BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THIS.\nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GETTING THE HONEST TRUTH.\nWHEN THE CAMERAS ARE OFF AND THE DOORS ARE SHUT.\nAND HILLARY CLINTON AND HER SENIOR ADVISERS REALLY TALK\nABOUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT CATHOLICS\nIS REPUGNANT. IT IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH\nAMERICAN VALUES. THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT MAKES\nAMERICA GREAT. THOSE ARE THE THEMES THAT COME\nOUT BROADLY. I THINK IT IS WHY THEY WANT TO\nMAKE CHANGES. >> I HAVE TO ROLL.\nTHANK YOU.

WE'VE SEEN FIVE SEPARATE\nWIKILEAKS DOCUMENT DUMPS IN THE LAST 48 HOURS.\nAN E-MAIL, SOME OF THEM NOT INTERESTING.\nSOME OF THEM ARE DEEPLY REVEALING.\nYOU GO ON THE WASHINGTON POST WEBSITE, ONE OF THE BIGGEST\nNEWSPAPERS IN THE WORLD. AS OF THIS AFTERNOON, THERE ARE\nNO STORIES ABOUT IT ON THE FRONT PAGE.\nTHE ONLY STORY THAT REFERS TO IT IS AN UNSUB SUBSTANTIATED CLAIM\nTHAT THIS IS PART OF A RUSSIAN. ALL THE REST OF THE STUFF\nCOMPLETELY IGNORED. THE PRESS BY DOING THAT OR NOT\nDEVALUES ITS OWN CURRENCY. THIS IS GOING TO BE OVER IN A\nMONTH. WHERE ARE THEY GOING TO BE THEN?\nNO CREDIBILITY. THIS HURTS THEM.\nIT'S SHORTSIGHTED AND DONE. I THINK IT'S THE BEGINNING OF\nTHE END OF THE OLD MEDIA ORDER. >> I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.\nI THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE TRUST THOSE OUTLETS WHEN THEY\nSHOULDN'T BE TRUSTED. THEY'RE AN EXTENSION OF THE\nCAMPAIGN. CHELSEA CLINTON HAD ENOUGH SENSE\nTO RECOGNIZE THE PAY TO PLAY SERIOUSNESS.\nSHE WAS CALLED A SPOILED BRAT FOR REVEALING IT, BUT THEN WE\nFIND OUT AS IT RELATES TO THE MONEY THEY WERE RAISING INTO THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION FOR HAITI THAT THEY'RE SEPARATED OUT THE\nCLINTON DONORS AND FRIENDS OF BILL TO GIVE THEM ACCESS FOR\nOPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE MONEY. >> AGAIN, THIS IS WHAT ALL OF US\nTHOUGHT ALL ALONG. WHEN THE CLINTON FOUNDATION RAN\nDOWN TO DO WORK IN HAITI AND MUCH OF IT HAS BEEN CALLED INTO\nQUESTION, WE WONDERED AT THE TIME, IS THIS STATE DEPARTMENT\nCONTRACTS? IT TURNS OUT ON A FEW OCCASIONS,\nAND I IMAGINE THIS IS JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG, THAT CLINTON\nFRIENDS GOT PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT.\nAND THEN THE COMMENTS ABOUT CATHOLICS, ESPECIALLY MORE TRADITIONAL CATHOLICS, BUT THE\nMOST, I THINK, DERISIVE AND DISMISSIVE --\n>> IT'S WORSE THAN THAT. YOU GOT JOHN PEDESTA TALKING\nABOUT INFILTRATING THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.\nWHO THINKS LIKE THIS UNLESS YOU'RE A STATIST MARXIST, A\nREALLY RADICAL PERSON. LET ME GIVE YOU A FEW MORE\nQUICKIES. WE LEARNED THAT HILLARY HATES\nEVERYDAY AMERICANS BETWEEN PEDESTA AND ANOTHER WE KNOW THEY\nSAID I KNOW SHE'S BEGUN TO HATE EVERYDAY AMERICANS, BUT I THINK\nWE SHOULD USE IT ONCE. SERIOUSLY?\nAND THEN WE'VE GOT WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT, INFILTRATING THE\nCATHOLIC CHURCH, AND THEY KNEW SAUDI ARABIA AND QATAR ARE\nFUNDING ISIS, BUT SHE STILL TOOK THEIR MONEY.\nIT'S BREATHTAKING WHAT WE'RE LEARNING.\nWHY ARE YOU LAUGHING? IT'S NOT FUNNY.\n>> IT'S OVER SUSPICION YOU EVER HAD ABOUT THE CLINTONS.\nI WONDER WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT?\nTHEY'RE FIGHTING ABOUT MONEY BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL GETTING RICH\nAND NEEDLING EACH OTHER BEHIND THE SCENES AND SAYING NASTY\nTHINGS OVER THE SPOILS. THEY'RE ATTACKING NORMAL PEOPLE,\nRELIGIOUS PEOPLE, PEOPLE OF FAITH, RIGHT?\nAND THEY'RE ALSO BASICALLY LYING ABOUT THEIR MOTIVATIONS ABOUT\nEVERYTHING. AND NOW WE RIP OFF THE COVERS\nAND IT TURNS OUT TO ALL BE TRUE. WE'RE PRETTY PRECIOUS, I GUESS.\n>> IT'S ABOUT AS IT ALWAYS IS WITH THEM, IT'S ABOUT POWER AND\nMONEY.

IT'S NOT EASY.\n>> NO. THAT'S WHY MOST PEOPLE BECOME\nMEMBERS OF THE ESTABLISHMENT. IT'S A LOT EASIER.\nIT'S A LOT MORE CONVENIENT, AND YOU GO TO A LOT BETTER PARTIES.\nI DON'T LIKE THEM, SO IT NEVER BOTHERED ME.\nHE'S GOING TO HAVE A HARD SLOG, BUT IF ANYONE CAN DO IT, HE CAN.\nHE'S SWINGING FOR THE FENCES. HE HAS TO DO EVENTS THAT BRING\nALL OF THIS TOGETHER AND WHETHER IT'S RELIGIOUS LIBERTY SPEECH OR\nREALLY HIGHLIGHTING THE CORRUPTION BEYOND JUST THE\nRALLIES, I THINK IT'S TIME FOR HIM TO GO BACK TO SOME OF THE\nCOMMUNITIES J UNDERSERVED, THAT HE DID IN AUGUST.\n>> TUCKER, THANK YOU FOR STAYING UP LATE.\nI SAW YOU ON \"FOX AND FRIENDS.\" NICE OF YOU TO COME BACK.\n>> I LOVE IT. >> YOU'VE BEEN MIA.\n>> I WAS TRYING TO ELBOW MY WAY IN.\n>> COMING UP WITH WIKILEAKS E-MAIL DUMP SHOWS HOW HILLARY\nCLINTON THINKS SHE CAN ACT DIFFERENTLY IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE.\nPLUS TONIGHT. >> CROOKED HILLARY WANTS TO END\nFOREVER THE AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE THAT OUR FOUNDERS\nGAVE US.

LOOK, THE WORD ETHICS AND\nJOURNALIST SHOULD NEVER BE USED IN THE SAME SENTENCE.\nTHE CORRUPTION IS ABOUND. ALL OUR INSTITUTIONS OF\nGOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN INFECTED BY THIS CORRUPTION, AND PUT HILLARY\nCLINTON WILL CONTINUE IT. WHEN LORETTA LYNCH MEETS BILL\nCLINTON ON A TARMAC DAYS BEFORE THEY MAKE THE DECISION NOT TO\nCHARGE MRS. CLINTON WITH A MOUND OF EVIDENCE OF CRIMINAL\nACTIVITY. WHEN ERIK HOLDER WOULDN'T TURN\nOVER PAPERS TO CONGRESS WHICH HE WAS SUPPOSED TO DO BY LAW.\nHE'S BEEN THE ONLY ATTORNEY GENERAL TO BE FOUND IN CONTEMPT\nOF CONGRESS. YOU LOOK AT THE IRS WITH WHAT'S\nGOING ON THERE WITH THE ATTACKS ON CONSERVATIVE 5013 Cs.\nIT GOES ON. THEY THUMB THEIR NOSE AT THE\nRULE OF LAW. THE LAW ONLY PERTAINS TO, LIKE\nYOU SAID, YOU AND I, AND THE LITTLE GUY, THE EVERYDAY DAY.\nBUT IT DOESN'T APPLY TO THEM. THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS.\nTHIS IS VERY DISHEARTENING. IT IS ALL THROUGHOUT THE FEDERAL\nGOVERNMENT. ONLY DONALD TRUMP GIVES US A\nCHANCE TO BREAK UP THIS WASHINGTON CARTEL AND RETURN\nPOWER TO THE STATES AND THE PEOPLE.\n>> AS A PASTOR, REVEREND SCOTT, WHEN WE SEE JOHN PEDESTA IS\nTALKING ABOUT INFILTRATION OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, THEY WANT\nTO INFILTRATE THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WITH THEIR IDEOLOGY FOR\nTHE PURPOSE OF FAUX MEANTING A REVOLUTION.\n>> I'M AMAZED BUT NOT SURPRISED. THE BIBLE SPEELKS OF DEEDS BEING\nDONE AND DARKNESS BEING BROUGHT TO LIGHT.\nTHESE ARE DARK DEEDS BEING BROUGHT TO THE LIGHT.\nIF DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN HASN'T DONE ANYTHING, IT HAS\nEXPOSED THIS CORRUPTION THAT EXISTS NOT ONLY IN THE UPPER\nLEVELS OF GOVERNMENT BUT FILTERING DOWN THROUGH THE MEDIA\nAS WELL. LIKE YOU SAID, SHE WON'T SAY\nRADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORIST. TRUMP SAID IT TO HER, SHE WOULD\nNOT SAY THOSE WORDS. BUT THEY TALKED ABOUT THE\nBASTARDIZATION OF OUR FAITH, AND THEY TALKED ABOUT THEY\nDOWNGRADED CATHOLICS AND EVANGELICALS.\nTHOSE ARE THE REAL BIGOTS. WE SEE IT.\nHILLARY CLINTON IS A BIGOT, AND SHE'S A BIGOT THAT TRIES TO PLAY\nTHE RACE CARD. BUT SHE'S THE ONE THAT'S GUILTY\nOF IT. SHE LOOKS DOWN ON BLACKS.\nSHE'S ANTI-CHRISTIAN, ANTI-CATHOLIC, ANTI-EVANGELICAL.\nBUT IF SHE CAN HOODWINK US FOR USING US FOR HER PURPOSES, SO BE\nIT. >> THANK YOU.\nCOMING UP NEXT RIGHT HERE ON \"HANNITY.\"\n>> I WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE TO THOSE TRAMPS THAT HAVE SLEPT\nWITH MY HUSBAND. >> THE VIEW'S JOY BAY HAR CALLS\nCLINTON'S ACCUSERS TRAMPS. SHE APOLOGIZED LATER.\nUP NEXT, REACTION AS WE CONTINUE.",

THE LATEST POLL HAS HIM UP OVER\nDEMOCRAT PATRICK MURPHY BY JUST TWO POINTS AND THAT WAS TAKEN\nBEFORE THE RELEASE OF THE AUDIO TAPE.\n>> RUBIO WITH FLORIDA BEING THE BIGGEST SWING STATE, WE KNOW\nTHEY DIDN'T WANT TO REPRESENT IT.\nHE DECIDED TO DO IT AT THE LAST EMPTY.\nIT SEEMS OB TUNISTIC AND THEY WILL RUN FOR PRESIDENT AGAIN.\nHE IS STARTING A LITTLE BIT ON A BAD NOTE.\nHE IS RUNNING AGAINST A DEMOCRAT.\nWITH INFLATION OF HIS RESUME. IT LOOKED FOR A WHILE.\nALL THAT TURBULENCE AROUND TRUMP IS AFFECTING RUBIO.\n>> YOU DON'T SEE RUBIO SHOWING UP, DO YOU?\n>> IN NEW HAMPSHIRE WITH A CLOSE RACE AS WELL.\nSHE IS ONE THAT HAS BEEN GOING AROUND ABOUT TRUMP.\nFIRST SHE SAID SHE WOULD VOTE FOR HIM AND NOT ENDORSE HIM AND\nSHE SAID SHE WOULDN'T VOTE FOR HIM, BUT DAYS BEFORE IN A DEBATE\nWITH THE OPPONENT, SHE WAS PRESSED ON WHETHER SHE THOUGHT\nTRUMP WAS A ROLE MODEL AND SAID SHE DID AND THE NEXT DAY SAID I\nDIDN'T MEAN IT AND I DON'T LIKE HILLARY CLINTON EITHER.\nSHE HAS TWISTED IT AROUND LIKE A PRETZEL.\nTHAT IS ABOUT AS CLOSE TO CALL AS THE PRESIDENTIAL BATTLE\nGROUND. PROBABLY THE WAY IT WILL GO FOR\nTRUMP MIGHT DECIDE THE RACE AS WELL.\n>> TIME FOR ONE MORE? YEAH, LET'S DO ONE MORE.\nPENNSYLVANIA. PAT TOOMEY AND OUR POLL UP FOUR\nPOINTS. THAT WAS THE VERY, VERY TIGHT\nRACE. THE INCUMBENT HAS KEPT HIS\nDISTANCE FROM TRUMP AND SAYING I WON'T UNENDORSE HIM, BUT I WON'T\nENDORSE HIM. PUBLICLY KEEPING HIS DISTANCE\nTHAT. OF COURSE IS ONE OF THE BIG BATTLE GROUNDS AT THE\nPRESIDENTIAL LEVEL AS WELL. TRUMP'S FORTUNE LIKELY TO AFFECT\nTHE OUT COME IN THE SENATE RACE AS WELL.\n>> WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.",

HILLARY CLINTON ON THE LEFT IS\nIN PUEBLO, COLORADO AND DONALD TRUMP IS IN LAKELAND, FLORIDA.\nWE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND BRING YOU ANY NEWS THAT COMES\nOUT OF THEM. WHILE WE MONITOR, WE WILL CHECK\nIN WITH MY FAVORITE THING IN THE ELECTION SEASON.\nTHE BIG BOARD. THE RACE TO 270.\nWE USUALLY TELL YOU DONALD TRUMP IS BEHIND IN THE RACE, BUT\nHERE'S WHAT HIS PATH LOOKS LIKE TO GET TO 270.\nWE HAVE BEEN GETTING NEW POLL NUMBERS SINCE THE RELEASE OF\nTHAT TAPE LAST FRIDAY THAT SUGGESTS MAYBE WE NEED TO TAKE A\nSTEP BACK FOR A MINUTE BECAUSE THE STORY IS NOT NECESSARILY\nABOUT HOW CLOSE TO 270 DONALD TRUMP COULD GET.\nTHE STORY MIGHT BE HOW FAR HE DROPS FROM THE 192 WE HAVE HIM\nAT RIGHT NOW. LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN.\nTHESE RED STATES WERE ALL MITT ROMNEY STATES IN 2012.\nYOU HAVE TO WIN THEM ALL AS A STARTING POINT.\nYOU HAVE TO WIN EVERYTHING THAT IS RED PLUS NORTH CAROLINA.\nWE KNOW IT'S A TOSS UP RIGHT NOW.\nTHE PROBLEM FOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS INDICATIONS THAT\nSOME OF THESE RED STATES COULD BE COMING LOOSE.\nI WILL SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN. IN THE SHOW ME STATE OF\nMISSOURI, DONALD TRUMP IS AHEAD. MITT ROMNEY WON BY AND THE\nMARGIN IS FIVE. IT'S BETTER TO BE FIVE POINTS\nAHEAD THAN FIVE POINTS BEHIND, BUT WHEN YOU ARE ONLY SITTING ON\nA FIVE-POINT LEAD, YOU MAY END UP WORRYING ABOUT MISSOURI.\nOTHER WARNING SIGNS IN VERY UNLIKELY PLACES.\nCHECK THIS OUT. UTAH.\nROMNEY WON BY 48 POINTS. IT HAS GONE FOR A DEMOCRAT SINCE\n1964. HE IS TIED WITH HILLARY CLINTON\nWITH 26%. WE WILL SHOW YOU WHY THAT'S\nHAPPENING LATER. UTAH IS VERY MUCH A STATE RIGHT\nNOW IF YOU ARE TRUMP THAT YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT.\nYOU MAY END UP HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT MISSOURI AND BELIEVE IT OR\nNOT, ALASKA. BEFORE THE VIDEOTAPE CAME OUT, A\nPOLL WAS OUT THAT HAD DONALD TRUMP AHEAD BY FIVE POINTS.\nLOOK AT GARY JOHNSON THE LANEITARIAN HERE.\nALASKA COULD BE A STATE HE WORRIES ABOUT.\nARIZONA COULD BE A PROBLEM. THERE IS CLOSE POLLS THERE.\nLET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. GEORGIA IS ANOTHER STATE THAT\nCOULD COST TRUMP THERE. HE STARTED AT 192.\nHE MAY HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE REPUBLICAN STATES.\nTHE RED STATES WE WERE ALL ASSUMING HE WOULD WIN.\nDONALD TRUMP IS IN A SITUATION WHERE THE FIRST THING HOE HAS TO\nDO IS SHORE UP EVERYTHING I JUST PUT GRAY ON THIS MAP.\nTHEN HE HAS TO WIN NORTH CAROLINA.\nONLY THEN WOULD HE HAVE THE COM ME IN STATE AND STILL BE A WAYS\nUP. THEN WE CAN TALK ABOUT STATES\nLIKE OHIO AND FLORIDA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE.\nLET ME SHOW YOU MORE. HERE'S A STATE HE WOULD NEED TO\nFLIP. ONE OF THE BEST CHANCES IS\nWISCONSIN. THESE NUMBERS ARE REVERSED.\nIT WAS 44% FOR CLINTON AND 37% FOR TRUMP.\nDON'T LET THAT BE MISLEADING. CLINTON IS UP SEVEN IN\nWISCONSIN. HE HAD A LONG WAY TO GO TO GET\nTO 270 BEFORE THAT TAPE CAME OUT.\nHE HAS A LONGER WAY TO GO RIGHT NOW.\nHE HAS MORE HEADACHES AND MORE LAND MINES AND MORE THINGS TO\nWORRY ABOUT AND LESS THAN A MONTH TO TAKE CARE OF ALL OF IT.\nTHAT'S THE SITUATION THE CAMPAIGN IS IN.\nDONALD TRUMP DOING HIS BEST TO STAY POSITIVE AND SHOW HIS\nVOTERS HE IS STILL CONFIDENT. >> I'M ASKING YOU TO BUILDING IN\nTHE AMERICAN DREAM ONCE AGAIN. IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.\nTHE DEADLINE HAS BEEN EXTENDED. MAKE SURE TO REGISTER.\nI THINK WE WILL HAVE A BREXIT COMING UP IN NOVEMBER.\n>> MIKE, YOU HAVE BEEN A STUDENT OF DONALD TRUMP FOR MANY YEARS.\nHIS PSYCHOLOGIST IS AN INTERESTING PART.\nTRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HE IS THINKING AND WHAT HIS\nCALCULATION IS AND WHAT HIS STRATEGY IS.\nIF THERE IS ONE. DO YOU GET THE SENSE THIS IS A\nGUY WHO REALIZES THE HOLE HE IS IN OR DOES HE BELIEVE THAT\nEVERYTHING IS GOING FINE? >> THERE IS A FLAT EARTH SOCIETY\nQUALITY TO SOME OF THESE RALLIES RIGHT NOW.\nSHE PREACHING TO THE CHOIR IN ANY ONE OF THE RALLIES.\nHE CANNOT IN HIS MIND BE THE THING HE CALLED ABOUT EVERYONE\nON THE PLANET WHICH IS A LOSER. HE IS SETTING UP A NARRATIVE\nTHAT EVEN WHEN HE LOSES, HE WON'T HAVE LOST.\nHE WILL BLAME IT ON US AND PAUL RYAN AND HE IS GOING TO BLAME IT\nON THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. I THINK WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT HE\nDOES START HIS OWN NETWORK. THAT NETWORK BECOMES DONALD\nTRUMP'S OWN SHADOW GOVERNMENT. I THINK IT WILL START VERY\nQUICKLY AFTER THE ELECTION EXCEPT IF HE STARTS CONTESTING\nTHE RESULT. IF YOUR MATH IS RIGHT, HOW IS HE\nGOING TO SAY THAT THEY STOLE IT FROM HIM IF HE ENDS UP GETTING\n170? >> IF THE MARGIN IS MORE THAN\n100 AND YOU ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT A FLORIDA 2000 SITUATION,\nTHAT'S THE OTHER QUESTION. I TALKED TO PEOPLE WHO KNOW HIM\nBETTER AND WATCHED HIM THROUGH THE YEARS AND SAID HEY, HE\nDIDN'T GET IN WITH A GRAND PLAN. HE LIKED THE IDEA OF WINNING.\nHE DIDN'T LIKE THE IDEA OF SERVING AS PRESIDENT.\nDO YOU THINK THERE IS A PART THAT WOULD BE RELIEVED TO GET\nTHE POLITICS THING OVER WITH? >> HAVING KNOWN HIM A LONG TIME,\nI CAN'T IMAGINE HIM SITTING IN A POLICY MEETING ABOUT CLIMATE\nCHANGE OR ANYTHING ELSE. I THINK THIS HAS BEEN FUN.\nHE HAS BEEN CARRIED ALONG BY THE NARCOTIC OF THE CAR OF THESE\nCROWDS. AT SOME POINT, IT MAKES YOU\nTHINK OF THE OLD LINE THAT RICHARD PRYOR USED TO HAVE\nSAYING HOW HE GOT CAUGHT WITH ANOTHER WOMAN BY HIS WIFE AND HE\nSAID WHO ARE YOU GOING TO BELIEVE, ME OR YOUR LYING EYES?\nSOMETIMES WHAT HE IS SAYING DOESN'T BEAR UP WITH ANY OF THE\nNUMBERS YOU SHOW DAY AFTER DAY. IT'S LIKE BIRTHERISM HAS GIVEN\nWAY TO TRUMPERISM. SOMEHOW THERE IS AN ALTERNATE\nREALITY GOING ON HERE. I REALLY BELIEVE THAT MAYBE IT'S\nIN THE BEST INTEREST OF SOME OF THE HIS FAN BOYS AT FOX NEWS TO\nSUPPORT THIS CANDIDACY. IF HE LOSES, THEY MIGHT END UP\nLOSING. THE TRUMP NEWS NETWORK OR\nWHATEVER HE IS GOING TO CALL IT WILL BE A FORCE OF NATURE IN\nTHIS COUNTRY. >> THAT'S MY OTHER QUESTION.\nSO MUCH OF THE TRUMP IMAGE AND MESSAGES THAT I'M A WINNER AND\nEVERYBODY IS A LOSER. THINKING BACK TO THE REPUBLICAN\nPRIMARIES AND EVERY DEBATE. RUBIO AND BUSH SAID THEY CAN'T\nBEAT HILLARY. ONLY I CAN BEAT HILLARY.\nROMNEY CHOKED. I WON'T CHOKE.\nTHE TRUMP VOTERS ARE GOING TO GO ALONG WITH WHAT HE DESCRIBES.\nIF HE LOSES DO YOU THINK THEY BUY INTO IT?\n>> I THINK THEY WILL BUY INTO IT.\nTHAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ISSUE THE CANDIDATE IN THE FROM\nTHE REPUBLICAN PARTY. HE IS FROM THE PARTY OF TWITTER.\nHE IS FROM THE PARTY OF FACEBOOK.\nOBVIOUSLY IN A DOWN YEAR, IF HE SAID DOWN IS UP, OFTEN ENOUGH\nIT'S CLEAR THAT HE IS GETTING ENOUGH PEOPLE TO BELIEVE IT.\nIT'S QUITE REMARKABLE. >> IF HE DOES TAKE THIS MEDIA\nROUTE, THIS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED. THAT KEEPS HIM A RELEVANT PLAYER\nINTO THE NEXT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.\n>> HE BECOMES OUTSIDE OF GOVERNMENT THE MOST POWERFUL\nPOLITICAL FIGURE IN THE COUNTRY WITHOUT ANY OF THE\nRESPONSIBILITIES OF ACTUALLY BEING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES. >> THE NEWS THAT HOUSE SPEAKER\nPAUL RYAN WOULD BE HAPPY TO HEAR.\nDAILY NEWS, MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR. COMING UP NEXT, MORE REACTION TO\nTHIS NEW UNSHACKLED DONALD TRUMP.\n>> IF YOU SNEEZE, HE CALLS UP AND ANNOUNCES THIS IS A TERRIBLE\nTHING. I DON'T WANT HIS SUPPORT AND I\nDON'T CARE ABOUT HIS SUPPORT. >> TRUMP TALKING ABOUT PAUL\nRYAN. A POLL OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS\nFINES THAT TRUMP IS MORE POPULAR THAN PAUL RYAN TO DISCUSS THE\nWAR ON THE PARTY'S LEADERSHIP WITH THE PANEL AND THE EFFECT IT\nCOULD HAVE ON ELECTION DAY.

NOT ONLY DO WE NOT SEE ANY MORE\nDOING THAT, BUT WE HAD TWO WHO CAME BACK.\nIT SEEMS THAT TRUMPO HOLD IS AFFECTING THE PARTY LEADERS.\n>> THAT'S HUGELY SIGNIFICANT AND HIS PERSONAL AMBITIONS IN TERMS\nOF HOW THEY HAD TO MOVE WITH A GALVANIZING DEBATE BEHIND TRUMP.\nNOT ONLY IN THE WAKE OF PAUL RYAN, BUT THE ATTACKS IN THE\nPAST. THEY WILL CONTINUE ON BOTH\nFRONTS. THEY ARE RIGHT.\nTHE MATH IS NOT THERE. HE IS ONLY GOING TO COUNT ON\nTURNING OUT HIS BASE VOTERS AND HE GOT THEM AND THAT'S ONLY\nABOUT 40%. THAT'S NOT GOING TO HELP HIM GET\nOVER THE LINE IN SWING STATES HE NEEDS.\nTHIS BORAGE OF VICIOUS PERSONAL ATTACKS ON THE CLINTONS IS GOING\nTO GET THE VOTES ON THE FAR SIDE AMONG THE DEMOGRAPHICS THAT A\nALIGNED SO HEAVILY BEHIND HER. LATINOS AND AFRICAN-AMERICANS\nAND YOU DON'T SEE WHERE THE STRATEGY HAS ANY PLAYOFF.\n>> THE FULL ON ATTACKS IN THE DEBATE ON SUNDAY NIGHT.\nTHIS CATCHING ATTENTION TODAY.

RUDY GIULIANI THE MAYOR ON 9/11\nAND FAMOUS FOR LEADERSHIP THAT DAY AND IN THE AFTERMATH, HE WAS\nNOT SAYING BACK THEN ATTACKING HILLARY CLINTON OVER WHAT SHE\nWAS DOING THAT DAY. TAKE I LISTEN.\n>> I HEARD HER SAY I WAS THERE THAT DAY.\nI DON'T REMEMBER SEEING HILLARY CLINTON THERE.\nTHAT WAS LIKE WHEN SHE SAID SHE HAD A RUN THROUGH GUNFIRE.\nTHAT TURNED OUT TO BE WHAT DO WE CALL IT?\nA LIE. >> AND THAT IS STRIKING TO SEE\nJUST GIVEN RUDY GIULIANI'S REPUTATION FROM 9/11.\nWHATEVER YOU THINK OF HIM, THAT REPUTATION THAT FORGED HAD\nNOTHING TO DO WITH PARTISANSHIP AND EVERYTHING TO DO WITH\nWORKING ACROSS THE AISLE. NOW IT'S A POLITICAL WEAPON.\n>> IT IS AND I THINK RUDY GIULIANI HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY\nFOR VENT TO SAY THE LEAST IN HIS SUPPORT OF DONALD TRUMP AND NOT\nREALLY PAYING TRIBUTE. AS TO BE FAIR, HE HAS DONE AT\nTIMES IN THE PAST SAYING SHE WORKED HARD ON BEHALF OF\nFAMILIES WHO WERE BEREAVED ON 9/11 AND OTHER GENERALLY\nPOSITIVE SENTIMENTS LIKE THAT. GIULIANI AND OTHERS ARE PART OF\nTHIS STRATEGY THAT IS ALL ABOUT GOING FULL BORE AGAINST HILLARY\nCLINTON AND TRYING TO UNDER CUT HER IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE.\nTO CIRCLE BACK TO A POINT, ONE OF THE DANGERS IS THAT IT\nMOTIVATES OR POTENTIALLY MOTIVATES DEMOCRATS WHO ARE NOT\nIN LOVE WITH HILLARY CLINTON TO COME OUT AS IT WERE IN DEFENSE\nOF HER. I UNDERSTAND WHY TRUMP DID IT IN\nTHE DEBATE AND HE NEEDED TO SHORE UP HIS BASE AND IT'S A\nSTRATEGY THAT HAPPENS WITH RISKS.\n>> I WANT TO SHOW YOU WE TALKED ABOUT THIS A MINUTE AGO, BUT THE\nREACTION OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS AND HOW THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT THIS\nWAR WITH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND THE AFTERMATH OF THE\nELECTION IF THEIR CANDIDATE LOSES.\nHERE'S TWO OF THEM TALKING ABOUT THE IDEA OF REVOLT.\nTAKE A LISTEN. >> THE REPUBLICANS VOTERS ARE\nNOT GOING TO STAND FOR THIS.

WE ARE TIRED OF TAKING IT.\nWE ARE TIRED OF BEING DEPLORABLE.\n>> WHAT DONALD TRUMP STIRRED UP COMES TO THE REPUBLICAN BASE,\nIT'S NOT GOING TO GO AWAY AFTER THE ELECTION.\nIS IT? >> OH, NO.\nTHIS IS NOT A TEMPORARY PHENOMENON AND WE SHOULD REMIND\nPEOPLE THIS IS A PHENOMENON THAT HAPPENED IN OTHER COUNTRIES AS\nWELL. THIS RIGHT WING POPULOUS HAS\nTAKEN HOLD OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY REGARDLESS OF THE RESULTS\nOF THIS ELECTION. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY FROM ANY COHESIVE ALLIANCE BEHIND THE\nPRINCIPALS AND THE VALUES AND THE THINGS THEY HAVE ALWAYS\nSTOOD FOR AND PAUL RYAN IN PARTICULAR IS AN INCREDIBLY\nDIFFICULT SITUATION. IT IS FASCINATING TO WATCH HIM\nRUNNING ADS ABOUT HOPE AND OPTIMISM AND THE FUTURE BASED ON\nPOOR CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPALS AND POSITIVE GOOD FUTURE AND WAGING\nTHE CAMPAIGN THAT IS ALL BASED ON A FUTURE THAT IS FAR MORE\nDARK AND HE IS THE ONLY PERSON WHO CAN GRAB AHOLD OF THAT AND\nWAGE IT BY ANY STRETCH ONE OF THE MOST NEGATIVE AND VICIOUS\nCAMPAIGNS WE HAVE SEEN IN PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS IN A LONG,\nLONG TIME. IF HE ONLY COUNTS ON TRUMP\nSUPPORTERS, THAT WILL BE A LOSING BATTLE.\nHE IS GOING TO SEE HEMORRHAGING OF WOMEN AND AMONG\nCOLLEGE-EDUCATED VOTERS WHERE HE WAS HOLDING OFF IN STATES.\nHOW HE GETS THE NUMBERS HE NEEDS TO GET ACROSS THE LINE IS\nIMPOSSIBLE TO SEE WITH THIS STRATEGY.\nUNLESS WE ARE UNDER COUNTING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THIS\nCAMP RIGHT NOW AND MOST OF THE POLLING IS DEAD WRONG.\n>> JOINING US ON THE PHONE, WE WILL GET TO YOU IN THE STUDIO\nNEXT TIME, I PROMISE. THANKS FOR JOINING US AND NEW\nNUMBERS SHOW ABOUT A HALF MILLION AMERICANS HAVE ALREADY\nVOTED.

LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THE\nVIDEO AND THEN FROM THE VIDEO TO THE DEBATE.\nHE HAD A GREAT NIGHT. HE'S UP TWO POINTS.\nSOMETHING ELSE COULD HAPPEN AND WE COULD BE DOWN FIVE POINTS.\nIT'S A CONSTANT FLUCTUATION. THE IMPORTANT THING TO LOOK AT\nIN POLLS IS FOR MOMENTUM.

THERE'S A VERY NARROW PATH TO\nVICTORY AND I DON'T THINK IT'S JUST AS SIMPLE AS HIM HAVING A\nGREAT DEBATE PERFORMANCE. I DO THINK HE'S GOT TO PICK UP\nAND APPEAL TO MORE PEOPLE. HE'S GOT TO WIN SOME WOMEN BACK.\nHE CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE ANY OF THE ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS\nWHICH AT THE END OF THE DAY, I HAVE BEEN HAVING CONVERSATIONS\nAND FOCUS GROUPS AND THROUGH OTHER MEDIUMS WITH TRADITIONAL\nREPUBLICANS OR MORE CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS WHO ARE SAYING I\nHATE THIS, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY I HAVE TO VOTE FOR THE\nPOLICY, NOT NECESSARILY THE PERSON.\nSO IF MORE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SEPARATE HIMSELF,\nTHEN HIS POLL NUMBERS SHOULD COME UP AGAIN.\nIT'S REALLY UNPREDICTABLE AT THIS POINT BECAUSE OF WHAT WE\nKNOW MIGHT STILL BE COMING.

THEY DON'T CARE FOR THE AVERAGE\nEVERYDAY AMERICANS, THE PEOPLE THAT MAKE THIS COUNTRY GREAT.\nWE'LL HAVE MORE ON THAT IN A SECOND.\nALSO RELEASED E-MAILS REVEAL MAJOR CONTRADICTIONS ON KEY\nTOPICS. SHE WANTS AN INCREASE OF SYRIAN\nMIGRANTS COMING INTO AMERICAN, BUT ACCORDING TO THE E-MAILS IN\nA 2013 SPEECH, CLINTON ACTUALLY ADMITTED WHAT DONALD TRUMP HAS\nBEEN SAYING, THAT REFUGEES CANNOT BE PROPERLY VETTED AND\nCOULD PUT COUNTRIES THEY ENTER AT RISK.\nIS SHE WILLING TO GAMBLE WITH YOUR LIFE?\nNOW CLINTON ALSO SAYS SHE WANTS A NO FLY ZONE IN SYRIA, BUT THE\nE-MAILS SHOW SHE WAS SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE IDEA DURING A SPEECH\nFOR GOLDMAN SACS. SHE WAS ALSO UNSURE ABOUT\nSUPPORTING OR OPPOSING THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE, AND ALSO\nPRAISED FRACKING DESPITE NOW BEING A SO-CALLED CHAMPION OF\nCLIMATE CHANGE. SHE'S A CRITIC OF WALL STREET,\nBIG BANKS AND PUBLIC, BUT SHE PRAISED THEIR ACTIONS AFTER THE\n2007 FINANCIAL COLLAPSE. SHE FAVORED A PLAN THAT WOULD\nCUT SOCIAL SECURITY AND SHE SAYS THE OPPOSITE TO THE AMERICAN\nPEOPLE. AND UNLIKE WHAT SHE SAYS NOW IN\nPAID SPEECHES, CLINTON SUPPORTED OPEN BORDERS AND OPEN TRADE.\nSHE ALSO SAID SHE LIKED TO SEE THE U.S. MOVE TOWARD A\nSOCIALIZED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM JUST LIKE WHAT THEY HAVE IN\nCANADA.

IT TURNED OUT TO BE THE OTHER\nDAY. IT WAS REALLY FAR OFF.\nI THINK THE OTHER THING THAT WE'RE SEEING WITH THIS IS JUST\nTHE TOTAL CYNICISM OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN WASHINGTON AND WITH\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN.

THEY SAID ABOUT CATHOLICS THAT'S\nREPUGNANT. THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT MAKES\nTHIS COUNTRY GREAT, AND I THINK IF THOSE ARE THE THEMES THAT\nCOME OUT BROADLY FROM THE LEAKS, I THINK IT SETS INTO THE VOTER\nWHY THEY WANT TO MAKE CHANGE, AND DONALD TRUMP IS THE\nCANDIDATE OF THAT CHANGE. >> I GOT TO ROLL.\nTHANK YOU.",

NOT ONE.\nPEOPLE LIVING HERE HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING ECONOMICALLY FOR A\nLONG TIME AND THEY STILL ARE, SO THE QUESTION IS, WILL THEY COME\nOUT IN DROVES FOR HILLARY CLINTON THE WAY THEY DID FOR\nPRESIDENT OBAMA? >> HILLARY!\n>> HILLARY IS THE BEST CANDIDATE.\n>> THAT'S A NO BRAINER. >> THERE HAVE BEEN DECADES OF\nECONOMIC DESPAIR AND A DWINDLING FAITH THAT POLITICIANS WILL\nHELP. >> I THINK THE DEMOCRATIC\nPLATFORM IS SAYING THE SAME THING WE HAVE HEARD FOR ABOUT\nTHE PAST 50 YEARS. >> OVER AND OVER.\n>> OVER AND OVER. >> SINCE THE WAR ON POVERTY WAS\nDECLARED. >> YES.\n>> JEFF CROSBY USED TO BE IN GANGS.\nTHAT LANDED HIM IN PRISON. NOW HE'S WORKING TO KEEP KIDS\nFROM THE SAME LIFE HE LIVED. >> IT'S ONE OF THE HIGHEST CRIME\nAREAS IN CLEVELAND. >> Reporter: THIS IS?\n>> YES, ABOUT 10 GANGS OVER HERE.\nWHAT'S UP? >> WHAT'S UP?\n>> YOU GOOD? >> YEAH.\n>> Reporter: I THINK THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS TAKEN US\nFOR GRANTED. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY LITERALLY\nIGNORES US, EXCEPT FOR TRUMP. TRUMP IS STRIVING TO MAKE\nINROADS BUT HE IS A POLARIZING FIGURE.\n>> I DON'T TRUST DONALD, THAT'S ALL.\n>> BECAUSE HE GOT MONEY? THAT AIN'T EVERYTHING.\n>> I'M WILLING TO VOTE FOR A CLOWN BEFORE DONALD TRUMP.\n>> Reporter: REALLY? >> YES.\nWITH A RED NOSE. I DO AGREE WITH REPUBLICANS\nSOMETIMES, BUT I DON'T AGREE WITH NOTHING THAT DONALD TRUMP\nSTANDS FOR. >> Reporter: AND THAT BRINGS US\nTO THE SECOND PART OF THIS OHIO CHAPTER, 200 MILES SOUTH.\nWE'RE IN PIKE COUNTY, OHIO, AND THIS PLACE MATTERS A LOT, NOT\nFOR THE NUMBER OF VOTES HERE BUT BECAUSE OF WHAT IT REPRESENTS.\nIT USED TO BE SOLIDLY BLUE BUT IT'S BEEN MOVING MORE AND MORE\nRED. IN 2012 THAT WAS THE CLOSEST\nCOUNTY IN THE COUNTRY. MITT ROMNEY WON HERE BY A SINGLE\nVOTE, JUST ONE VOTE. IT'S 96% WHITE, LARGELY\nBLUE-COLLAR AND UNEMPLOYMENT HERE IS HIGH.\nTHESE ARE EXACTLY THE VOTERS DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN SPEAKING\nTO, SO IF HIS MESSAGE ISN'T RESONATING HERE, HE'S IN\nTROUBLE. >> I'D SAY RIGHT NOW YOU'RE\nLOOKING AT A COIN TOSS. >> A COIN TOSS AMONG UNION\nWORKERS WHO UNTIL NOW HAVE BEEN SOLIDLY BLUE.\nHAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT BEFORE?\n>> NO. NO.\n>> Reporter: DONALD TRUMP SAYS HE'S THE ONE TO BRING THESE JOBS\nBACK. HE'S THE ONE TO BUILD UP YOUR\nINDUSTRY. >> DONALD TRUMP IS SAYING THAT,\nTHAT'S TOTAL PROPAGANDA. WHERE'S HIS MERCHANDISE MADE?\nWHAT DOES HE HAVE TO OFFER TO AMERICAN INDUSTRY?\nNOTHING. >> Reporter: MANY HERE DO\nBELIEVE TRUMP AND SEE HIM AS THEIR BEST SHOT AT GETTING\nAHEAD. SINCE 2000, OHIO HAS LOST NEARLY\nA THIRD OF ITS MANUFACTURING JOBS.\n>> HE GETS A LOT OF THINGS THAT IS AMAZING THAT HE WAS TELLING\nUS HE CAN DO FOR US. >> Reporter: ANGIE SHANKS RUNS A\nSUCCESSFUL REAL ESTATE FIRM HERE.\n>> IT NEEDS MORE JOBS, MORE BETTER-PAYING JOBS.\n>> Reporter: YOU VOTED FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA IN 2008.\n>> YES, I DID. >> Reporter: BUT HER FAITH IN\nTHE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS FADED.\n>> I THINK TRUMP IS A BUSINESSMAN AND THE COUNTRY IS A\nBUSINESS AND IT NEEDS TO BE RUN AS A BUSINESS.\n>> Reporter: WHEN WE MET ANGIE SHE WAS LEANING TOWARDS TRUMP.\nNOW, AFTER THE \"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD\" TAPE SURFACED SHE'S\nRECONSIDERING. YOU'RE A LIFE LONG DEMOCRAT?\n>> YES. >> Reporter: SO YOU'RE VOTING\nFOR HILLARY THIS TIME AROUND? >> NO, I'M NOT.\n>> Reporter: NO? >> MY DAD WAS A COAL MINER.\nTHEY PUT THE COAL MINERS OUT OF WORK.\n>> Reporter: WE LEFT OHIO ASKING THIS QUESTION -- WHY DOES\nECONOMIC PAIN FROM ONE TOWN TO THE NEXT PUSH SOME PEOPLE LEFT\nAND OTHERS RIGHT? >> POPPY HARLOW, YOU GOT SUCH A\nGREAT CROSS SECTION OF VOTERS IN OHIO AND WHAT STRUCK ME\nLISTENING TO THOSE UNION GUYS WHO ARE NORMALLY SO SOLIDLY\nDEMOCRATS, THEY'RE -- >> YEAH SOME ARE BUT SOME ARE\nNOW IN THE TRUMP CAMP. DO YOU REMEMBER IN THE CNN TOWN\nHALL SIX MONTHS AGO WHEN HILLARY CLINTON SAID \"I'M GOING TO PUT A\nLOT OF COAL MINERS OUT OF WORK\" THEY STILL REMEMBER THAT AND\nQUOTE HER ON THAT. THEY THINK ABOUT THAT AND TALK\nABOUT THAT MORE THAN HER E-MAILS OR BENGHAZI AND THAT HAS STUCK\nWITH THEM AND TRUMP'S MESSAGE, THE BOILER MAKERS WE INTERVIEWED\nTHERE, THE UNION, THEY ARE NOT ON THE TRUMP TRAIN BUT WHEN YOU\nPULL IN SOME OF THEIR COLLEAGUES ARE BECAUSE THERE'S A BIG SIGN\nTHAT SAID \"FOREIGN MADE VEHICLES AND PRODUCTS NOT APPRECIATED ON\nTHIS PROPERTY.\" AND THIS IS BEFORE THAT \"ACCESS\nHOLLYWOOD\" TAPE SURFACED. >> SO THAT'S IMPORTANT.\nWE FILMED THIS OVER THE LAST TWO MONTHS UP UNTIL RIGHT BEFORE THE\n\"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD\" TAPE CAME OUT WITH DONALD TRUMP SAYING THOSE\nSEXUALLY AGGRESSIVE REMARKS ABOUT WOMEN SO WE CALLED BACK\nEVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT IS BACKING TRUMP AND OUT OF ALL 26\nPEOPLE WE INTERVIEWED WHO ARE SOLIDLY BEHIND TRUMP, ALMOST ALL\nOF THEM STILL ARE, ONE OF THEM TOLD US THEY'RE NOT ANYMORE, THE\nOTHER TWO ARE ON THE FENCE BUT YOU SEE THE LOYALTY THERE, EVEN\nAFTER THAT THEY ARE STANDING BY HIM.\n>> POPPY, THANK YOU. WE'LL WATCH SO MUCH MORE OF THIS\nTHIS WEEKEND. WATCH MY FRIEND POPPY HARLOW ON\n\"YOUR MONEY, YOUR VOTE\" SATURDAY",

HE'S ACTING LIKE HE DID IN THE\nREPUBLICAN PRIMARY, IN THE FACE OF GREAT ADVERSITY RIGHT NOW,\nNOT THE BEST POLLING. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN HIS MESSAGE\nGETTING THROUGH, AND RESONATING WITH PEOPLE.\nHE'S RETREATING BACK TO HIS COMFORT ZONE.\nAND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW.\nTHAT'S NOT NECESSARILY A GREAT GENERAL ELECTION STRATEGY.\n>> THIS IS THE PLACE DONALD TRUMP, I THINK AS A CANDIDATE,\nTHAT'S A PLACE WHERE HE'S COMFORTABLE IN.\nGOING ON THE ATTACK. IT MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST\nPOLITICAL STRATEGY, BY IT'S SOMETHING THAT HE LIKES TO DO.\n>> WE HAVE TWO CANDIDATES IN THIS ELECTION.\nTHEY HAVE THEIR COMFORT ZONE CANDIDATES.\nI WANT TO TALK ABOUT UTAH. TRUMP IS ONLY  FIVE\nPOINTS, THAT IS STUNNING. AND CHECK OUT THIS POLL WHERE\nWE'RE LOOKING AT UTAH. YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP AND\nHILLARY CLINTON TIED. THAT IS FASCINATING.\nEVAN McMULLEN, WHO IS A MORMON, BYU GRAD, FORMER CIA OPERATIVE,\nGIVING THEM A RUN FOR THEIR MONEY AT 22%.\n>> SO IN MISSOURI, THE FIVE-POINT LEAD IS SHOCKING.\nTHER EVEN CAN THE MARGIN OF ERROR,\nCLINTON WOULD BE TIED. THAT'S STUNNING IN WAYS.\nIN UTAH, I DON'T THINK IT'S ALL JUST THE MORMON VOTE, BUT\nMORMONS, DONALD TRUMP HAS NOT POLLED WELL WITH MORMONS, EVEN\nIN THE PRIMARIES AND MORMONS TEND TO BE REPUBLICAN VOTERS.\nAND IT'S BEEN MORMON POLITICIANS, MITT ROMNEY, OTHERS\nWHO HAVE BEEN REALLY CRITICAL AND SCRUTINIZED TRUMP.\n>> YOU KNOW WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THAT, BRIANNBRIANNA, TRUM\nSUPPORT HAS HELD UP PRETTY WELL IN THE EVANGELICAL COMMUNITY,\nEVEN THOUGH HE'S HARDLY AN EVANGELICAL HIMSELF.\nBUT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN MORMONS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN SYMPATHETIC\nTO HIM. YOU HAVE THE ENTIRE UTAH\nDELEGATION IN THE SENATE, IN THE HOUSE SAYING WE'RE NOT\nSUPPORTING DONALD TRUMP ANYMORE. IT'S THE ONLY STATE WHERE ALL\nTHE REPUBLICANS ARE UNITED IN THAT WAY.\nIT'S JUST A -- IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK WE'LL BE\nLOOKING BACK ON, ON THIS ELECTION THAT MORMONS AND\nEVANGELICALS HAD BEEN ALLIED IN VIRTUALLY ALL RECENT\nPRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, MUCH LESS SO THIS TIME.\n>> IF WE COULD GO BACK TO THE MISSOURI POLL.\nTHAT'S SO INTERESTING, BECAUSE IT'S REALLY A SIGNAL OF WHERE\nTHIS RACE MIGHT BE GOING. THE LAST TIME MISSOURI WAS\nCOMPETITIVE AT THE PRESIDENTIAL LEVEL WAS IN 2008 WHEN BARACK\nOBAMA LOST THE STATE BY ONLY -- LESS THAN A POINT.\nHE ENDED UP CAMPAIGN THING IN THE FINAL DAYS OF THAT RACE, AND\nOBVIOUSLY HE WON THAT RACE BY A HUGE MARGIN OVER JOHN McCAIN.\nSO IF MISSOURI IS IN PLAY, WE ARE LOOKING AT THAT SORT OF\nOUTCOME IN THIS ELECTION. >> I WONDER WHAT YOU THINK -- I\nWANT TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT, BECAUSE JOHN PODESTA, YOU'VE GOT\nTHESE E-MAILS OF HIS THAT HAVE BEEN HACKED.\nYOU HAD ON FRIDAY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT POINTING A FINGER AT\nRUSSIAN HACKERS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT WE'VE SEEN AS A LOT OF\nCYBER ATTACKS. JOHN PODESTA IS GOING FURTHER\nTHAN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, SUGGESTING THAT THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN IS ACTIVELY WORKING WITH WIKILEAKS TO TIME THE\nRELEASE OF THESE E-MAILS. IS THERE ANYTHING TO BACK THAT\nUP? >> WELL, THERE IS SOME TWEET BY\nROGER STONE, HIM INTIMATING THERE WOULD BE E-MAILS COMING\nOUT. CERTAINLY FOR THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN, THEIR STRATEGY IS TO TIE IT TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN TO\nSUGGEST WRONGDOING ON THEIR PART.\nBUT THIS KIND OF INTRODUCES THE SPECTER THAT COME NOVEMBER, IS\nTHE ELECTION GOING TO TURN OUT -- IS IT GOING TO BE -- AS A\nVOTER, THERE'S SOME NERVOUSNESS GOING IN.\n>> IT SEEMS LIKE THE TRUTH HAS BEEN SO STRETCHED IN THIS\nELECTION BETWEEN JOHN PODESTA SAYING IT'S HARD TO SEE EXACT\nWILL YOU WHERE THE BASE IS. CLEARLY IT'S THEIR STRATEGY.\nFOR DONALD TRUMP AT THE DEBATE, RAISING THE QUESTION WHETHER\nTHERE WAS EVEN A HACKING PERIOD. SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS, WHAT\nDOES THIS DO TO VOTERS OTHER THAN UNDERMINE THEIR BELIEF THAT\nANYTHING CAN BE TRUE, THAT THEY CAN BELIEVE ANYONE, ANY\nINSTITUTION? >> I THINK IF THERE WERE SOME\nINTERFERENCE WITH ACTUAL VOTING ON ELECTION DAY, YOU ARE GOING\nTO SEE AN INTERFERENCE OR AN EFFECT ON OUR WHOLE PROCESS.\nBUT THERE'S BEEN SUCH A FLOOD OF INFORMATION ABOUT LEAKS AND\nRUSSIA AND SERVERS AND VLADAMIR PUTIN THAT I DON'T KNOW IT'S\nSEEPING INTO THE AVERAGE VOTER AT THIS POINT.\n>> BRIANNA, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE POLITICS ARE ULTIMATELY\nGOING TO BE OF THIS WIKILEAKS LEAK OF JOHN PODESTA'S E-MAIL.\nBUT TO THINK WE NOW LIVE IN A SOCIETY WHERE PRIVATE E-MAILS\nESSENTIALLY DON'T EXIST, WHETHER YOU WORK AT SONY PICTURES OR\nWHETHER YOU WORK FOR A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.\nTHAT'S A VERY DIFFERENT WORLD THAN WE'RE USED TO.\nAND I DON'T THINK IT'S A VERY GOOD ONE.\nI'M A JOURNALIST. I LIKE TO SEE WHAT THESE E-MAILS\nLOOK LIKE. BUT THE IDEA THAT E-MAILS ARE NO\nLONGER PRIVATE IS A SCARY THOUGHT.\n>> JEFFREY, VERY GOOD POINT. I'VE GOT TO GET A BREAK IN HERE.\nGUYS, THANKS SO MUCH.

YOU JUST PLAYED THEM ACCURATELY.\nTODAY I'M CALLING FOR HIM TO BE CANNED.\nNOW WE HAVE A MUCH, MUCH MORE SERIOUS DEVELOPMENT.\nNOW WE HAVE JOHN PODESTA IN CONVERSATION WITH SANDY NEUMAN,\nA LEFT WING FELLOW TRAVELER SO TO SPEAK, ARGUING THAT WE NEED A\nREVOLUTION WITHIN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH TO WHICH PODESTA SAYS,\nYES, I'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT. THAT'S WHY WE CREATED CATHOLIC\nUNITED AND CATHOLICS FOR THE COMMON GOOD.\nTHAT'S TWO PHONY CATHOLIC ORGANIZATIONS WHICH I HAVE BEEN\nAT WAR WITH FOR YEARS FUNDED BY GEORGE SOROS WAS CREATED BY JOHN\nPODESTA CREATED LIKE TERMITES TO EAT AWAY AT THE FOUNDATION OF\nTHE CATHOLIC RELIGION. SOROS PROVIDES THE MONEY, THE\nPOINT MAN IS DOUGH PODESTA. CATHOLICS UNITED IN 2008 LEAKED\nDOCUMENTS OVER TO CNN. WHEN I WENT ON TELEVISION WITH\nTHEM THAT NIGHT TO TRY AND GET ME KICKED OFF THE AIR BECAUSE I\nWAS TOO HARSH ON THE DEMOCRATS. ONE MONTH LATER, RIGHT AROUND\nTHANKSGIVING IN 2008, THOSE SAME DOCUMENTS WHICH BY THE WAY\nSOMEBODY AT CNN WAS GRACIOUS ENOUGH TO LEAK THEM TO ME,\nTHAT'S WHY I KNEW THEM, I GET A SUMMONS FROM THE IRS SAYING I'M\nUNDER INVESTIGATION BECAUSE I'M TOO CRITICAL OF VIOLATING THE\nIRS CODE. IT WAS STRIKINGLY SIMILAR.\nIT WAS GEORGE SOROS' MONEY BEHIND CATHOLIC UNITED WITH\nCHRIS KORZIN WHO CONTACT THE CNN TRYING TO GET ME OFF CNN.\n>> WHAT'S TRUE IN THE LIGHT OF THE E-MAIL IS THEIR DISREGARD,\nEVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT GETTING INTO THE WEEDS HERE, THEIR\nDISREGARD FOR CONSERVATIVE CATHOLICS VERSUS MORE LIBERAL\nCATHOLICS QUOTING FROM THESE E-MAILS.\nMANY OF THE MOST POWERFUL ELEMENTS OF THE CONSERVATIVE\nMOVEMENT ARE ALL CATHOLIC. MANY ARE CONVERTS FROM THINK\nTANKS TO THE MEDIA AND SOCIAL GROUPS.\nIT'S AN AMAZING BASTARDIZATION OF THE FAITH.\nTHEY MUST BE ATTRACTED TO THE SYSTEMATIC THOUGHT AND SEVERELY\nBACKWARDS GENDER RELATIONS. MUST BE TOTALLY UNAWARE OF\nCHRISTIAN DEMOCRACY, AND I WAS THINKING TO MYSELF AS I WAS\nREADING THAT, WHAT IF THEY WERE SAYING THAT OF THE MUSLIM FAITH\nAND HOW MUSLIM WOMEN ARE TREATED AND SHARIA LAW AND ALL OF THIS.\nI'M THINKING, MAN, OH, MAN, THAT WOULD BE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT.\nTHAT WOULD GET SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT COVERAGE.\n>> AND MALE CLERGY. YOU LOOK AT ORTHODOX JEWS, MORMONS, AND A LOT OF THEM HAVE\nTHE SAME IDEA OF SEXUAL RETICENCE WHICH IS TAUGHT BY THE\nCATHOLIC CHURCH. I CAN PUT UP WITH SOME STUPID\nCOMMENTS MADE BY THESE PEOPLE. WHAT I CANNOT PUT UP WITH BEYOND\nTHE BIGOTRY IS WHEN THERE'S AN INTEGRAL PLAN SETTING UP PHONY\nORGANIZATIONS TO CREATE A REVOLUTION, WHICH IS THEIR TERM,\nWITHIN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. JOHN PODESTA HAS TO GO.\nHILLARY CLINTON IS NOW IMPLICATED.\nTHAT'S HER CAMPAIGN MANAGER. NO OTHER RELIGION WOULD PUT UP\nWITH THIS AND CATHOLICS AREN'T EITHER.\n>> IT'S NOT JUST CATHOLICS. IT'S EVANGELICALS, THOSE WHO\nHAVE SOME VALUES THAT THEY THINK ARE NOT IN LOCK STEP WITH THE\nLIBERAL MOVEMENT. THEY ALL BUT SAY THAT.\nTHEY CAN DISMISS IS SAYING WE'RE NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT\nBECAUSE THE RUSSIANS ARE LEAKING THEM.\nWHAT'S CLEAR IS THE DISMISSIVE VIEW OF THE VERY RELIGIOUS, MORE\nTO THE POINT THE CONSERVATIVE RELIGIOUS.\n>> THAT'S TRUE, THAT THEY'RE DISDAINFUL OF EVANGELICALS AND\nDISPARAGES OF CATHOLICCATHOLICSE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS WHICH I JUST\nPOSTED AN HOUR AGO SHOW THERE'S A CONCERTED EFFORT AND HAS BEEN\nFOR YEARS ON THE PART OF JOHN PODESTA TO CREATE PHONY CATHOLIC\nORGANIZATIONS. CATHOLICS IN NAME ONLY, TO\nCREATE DISSENT, MANIPULATE THE PUBLIC OPINION, AND WORK AGAINST\nTHE CATHOLIC CHURCH. THIS IS FAR BEYOND ANY KIND OF\nBIGOTED COMMENT. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ONE MORE\nPERSON TELL ME ABOUT SOMEONE SPEAKING IN VULGAR TERMS.\nIT'S NOW OUT IN THE OPEN.

IT'S REGARDING SOME WIKILEAKS\nE-MAILS RELEASED, IN PARTICULAR THIS CONVERSATION BETWEEN TWO\nHILLARY CLINTON STAFFERS ABOUT CATHOLICS AND WHETHER THIS IS\nTRUE OR NOT, I GUESS, REMAINS A QUESTION.\nHERE IS APPARENTLY WHAT THE E-MAILS THAT WERE RELEASED SAID.\nBASICALLY SAYING THAT, CATHOLICS HAVE A BABASTARDIZATION.\nTHEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT WHEN THEY TALK\nABOUT -- IT GETS A LITTLE COMPLICATED AND DETAILED.\nYOU CAN READ THE E-MAILS. WE WILL HAVE THEM FOR YOU ON OUR\nFACEBOOK PAGE. THEY HAVE BEEN TALKED ABOUT ALL\nDAY. THE CATHOLICS -- YOU GREW UP\nCATHOLIC BUT YOU DO NOT PROFESS TO BE A PART OF IT ANYMORE.\n>> RIGHT. >> ONE OF THE STAFFERS ON THIS\nSAYS SHE DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE E-MAIL.\nIN FACT, I THINK WE HAVE HER ON TAPE SAYING THAT EARLIER TODAY.\n>> I'M A CATHOLIC. I DON'T RECOGNIZE THAT E-MAIL\nTHAT WE SAW. WE'RE NOT GOING TO FACT CHECK\nTHE E-MAILS THAT WERE STOLEN, HACKED BY IN AN EFFORT TO --\n>> WE HAVE A SITUATION WITH WIKILEAKS PUTTING OUT A BUNCH OF\nINFORMATION. IT'S BASICALLY FINDING-MAILE-MA\nTHEM. THEY ARE SAYING THIS IS\nDEPLORABLE TO DO TO THE CATHOLIC RELIGION.\n>> IT'S TWO STORIES. DOES ANYBODY BELIEVE THIS IS\nCOMING FROM WIKILEAKS? THAT'S LIKE A CHILD WHO THINKS\nMONEY ORIGINATES FROM HER DAD'S WALLET.\nIT DOESN'T. IT'S BEING SENT TO THEM AND THEY\nRELEASE IT. IF IT'S RUSSIA, IT'S SOMETHING\nTHAT WE AS A COUNTRY SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT.\nJUST BECAUSE IT HAPPENS TO TARGET A CANDIDATE YOU DON'T\nLIKE ISN'T ENOUGH FOR ME.

CATHOLIC FOR 12 YEARS.\nBUT I CAN TELL THE BASE IN THE MEDIA GENERALLY THEY SEE PEOPLE\nWHO ARE RELIGIOUS AS MARTIANS. THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.\n>> THE INTERESTING THING -- I LOOK BACK ON NUMBERS.\nCATHOLICS AS A GROUP HAVE NOT VOTED FOR A REPUBLICAN AS A\nMAJORITY SINCE 1984. THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN DID JUMP ON\nTHIS TODAY I THINK TRYING TO SAY, LOOK, THIS IS HOW THEY TALK\nABOUT YOU BEHIND CLOSED DOORS. DO YOU THINK THEY CAN TURN THAT\nAROUND WITH THE CATHOLICS? >> FIRST OF ALL, I'M A CATHOLIC\nAND I'M HIGHLY OFFENDED BY THE COMMENDS, HIGHLY OFFENDED.\nPRACTICING EVERY DAY. I THINK WHAT THEY -- THE THEORY\nWAS -- I THINK WHAT THEY WERE GOING FOR WAS TO DIVIDE AND\nCONCUR. DIVIDE CATHOLICS FROM\nEVANGELICALS OR A SUBSET OF CHRISTIANS WHO ARE BASTARDIZING\nCHRISTIANITY. THAT'S OFFENSIVE.\nI THINK IF YOU ARE UNDECIDED AND EVEN IF YOU ARE CHRISTIAN, YOU\nHAVE TO TAKE OFFENSE TO THIS. HERE IS WHY.\nIF PRESIDENT CLINTON, HILLARY CLINTON IS GOING TO STACK THE\nSUPREME COURT AND THE FEDERAL JUDICIAL SYSTEM, WILL YOUR\nRELIGIOUS FREEDOMS COME UNDER ATTACK?\nA LOT OF CATHOLICS AND CHRISTIANS BELIEVE UNDER CLINTON\nTHAT MAY BECOME AN ISSUE AT THE SUPREME COURT LEVEL.\nI WOULD SAY, THIS IS A NEGATIVE FOR HILLARY CLINTON BIG TIME.\n>> I SAW FATHER JONATHAN MORRIS SPEAK ON FOX ABOUT THIS.\nHE WAS VERY PASSIONATE AND ELOQUENT TALKING ABOUT THE\nIMPORTANCE OF FREEDOM OF RELIGION AND WHAT WE SEE\nHAPPENING THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. YOU SEE GENOCIDE AGAINST\nCHRISTIANS. THIS IS A TIME THAT THE UNITED\nSTATES SHOULD BE LEADING AND PROTECTING FAITH AND RELIGIOUS\nFREEDOMS WITH EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE IN OUR CONSTITUTION.\nSO THESE E-MAILS I THINK ARE VERY DAMAGING.\nI DO NOT BELIEVE HER WHEN SHE SAYS SHE DID NOT SEND THEM.\nI THINK IT'S CONVENIENT FOR THEM TO BLAME IT ON THE RUSSIANS\nBECAUSE THAT TIES TRUMP INTO PUTIN.\nIT'S CLEVER. BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IT WHEN I\nHEAR HER SAY IT AND I SAW HER SAYING IT.\nI DON'T KNOW. IT JUST SEEMS VERY CONVENIENT.\nTHE WIKILEAKS WENT THROUGH AND EDITED HOW MANY -- 20,000\nSOMETHING PLUS E-MAILS, MAYBE MORE.\nIT'S A BIT MUCH TO SWALLOW. AS A CATHOLIC, TOO.\nBUT THIS IS NOT A SURPRISE TO ME.\n>> YOU DON'T THINK THE RUSSIANS ARE INVOLVED?\n>> I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S RUSSIANS, CHINESE OR --\n>> DOESN'T THAT BOTHER YOU? >> OF COURSE IT DOES.\nOF COURSE IT DOES. >> IT BOTHERS ME --\n>> LET'S GET JUAN -- >> IT BOTHERS ME IF IT'S\nSOMEBODY HERE DOING IT. >> LET ME TELL YOU, THIS IS A\nBIZARRE CONVERSATION. SHE DIDN'T WRITE THE E-MAIL.\nTHE E-MAIL COMES TO HER FROM A GUY WHO IS INTERESTED IN THE\nRELATIONSHIP OF CATHOLICS AND POLITICS AND ESPECIALLY BIG\nDONORS AND THE LIKE. HE IS SAYING THIS.\nJENNIFER DIDN'T SAY IT. NOBODY IN THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN\nSAYS IT. SHE RESPONDS AND SAYS SOMETHING\nABOUT MAYBE THE FOLKS WHO ARE BECOMING ROMAN CATHOLIC DON'T\nWANT TO BECOME EVANGELICALS BECAUSE THEIR RICH FRIENDS\nWOULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT. THAT'S ALL THAT SAID.\nALL THIS STUFF ABOUT I'M OFFENDED --\n>> IF SOMEBODY SAYS SOMETHING RACIST TO ME, I SAY THAT'S --\n>> THIS IS NOT RACIST. THIS IS NOT ANTI-CATHOLIC.\n>> I DON'T CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION.\n>> THIS IS NOT ANTI-CATHOLIC. THIS IS SAYING -- WE HAVE THESE\nFREEDOMS IN OUR COUNTRY. IF YOU HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF\nPERSPECTIVE OR THEOLOGY, YOU CAN EXPRESS IT.\nYOU CAN SAY, SOMEBODY IS PLAYING A SOCIAL STATUS GAME IN TERMS OF\nSAYING THEY ARE COMFORTABLE BECOMING A CATHOLIC AS OPPOSED\nTO BECOMING AN EVANGELICAL. IF THEY ARE REALLY HAVING THIS\nCONVERSION, WHY DON'T THEY BECOME AN EVANGELICAL?\nIT LOOKS LIKE YOU ARE TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING TO GIVE --\n>> HE HAS A RIGHT TO BE -- HE HAS A RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO SAY IF\nHE FINDS THAT OFFENSIVE. JUST LIKE I DO.\n>> LET'S BE CLEAR, JENNIFER -- SHE DID NOT WRITE IT.\n>> IF I'M HAVING A CONVERSATION -- A CUP OF COFFEE\nWITH SOMEONE ON THE CORNER WHO HAPPENS TO BE THROWING OUT\nRACIAL EPITHETS LEFT AND RIGHT AND I CONTINUE THAT\nCONVERSATION, DON'T YOU SAY, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?\n>> THERE WERE NO EPITAPHS. THE MAN WAS EXPRESSING --\n>> I FEEL BEING CALLED BASTARDIZING --\n>> THERE'S A KEY DIFFERENCE THAT SOMEONE HAS TO MAKE CLEAR AT THE\nEND OF THE SEGMENT. RELIGION IS A SET OF IDEAS.\n>> RIGHT. >> RELIGION -- WHETHER IT'S\nISLAM, BUDDHIST, IT'S A SET OF IDEAS.\nIT'S NOT RACE. >> THANK GOD.\n>> AND IT'S -- NOBODY ON HER CAMPAIGN ACTUALLY WROTE THE\nBASTARDIZATION. THAT WAS SOMEONE FROM OUTSIDE.\n>> THANK YOU. >> I'M SUGGESTING THAT WAS THE\nCOMMENT THAT WAS MADE AND WHOEVER IT WAS, THE CAMPAIGN\nCONTINUED AN E-MAIL CONVERSATION WITH SOMEONE WHO WAS SAYING\nHIGHLY OFFENSIVE THINGS TO A GROUP THAT I'M PART OF.\n>> COMING UP, DID WIKILEAKS REVEAL MEDIA BIAS.\nWE WILL HAVE DETAILS NEXT.",

SHE'S PART OF THE ESTABLISHMENT.\nYOU KNOW, THE FACT THAT SHE WOULD SAY THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE\nCATHOLICS NOT BECAUSE THEY HAVE SINCERELY-HELD BELIEFS, BUT\nBECAUSE BE BEING AN EVANGELICAL WOULD BE NOT ACCEPTABLE BY THEIR\nRICH FRIENDS IS JUST FURTHER PROOF OF HER, OF HER VIEW OF THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE. AND SHE, YOU KNOW, THERE'S A\nLONG PATTERN OF HER SAYING THAT, YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO HAVE ONE\nPOSITION PUBLICLY, I'VE SEEN THIS IN THE E-MAILS RECENTLY,\nAND ONE POSITION PRIVATELY. IMPLYING THAT THE AMERICAN\nPEOPLE, THE AVERAGE AMERICAN IS TOO DUMB TO UNDERSTAND WHY SHE\nHAS TO HAVE ONE POSITION FOR THE ELITES AND ONE FOR EVERYBODY\nELSE. AND IT'S WHY SHE'S, IT'S WHY ALL\nTHESE ACCUSATIONS ARE BEING THROWN AGAINST DONALD TRUMP,\nBECAUSE THEY WANT TO STEER THE PUBLIC AWAY FROM ALL OF THESE\nREVELATIONS IN THESE E-MAILS, THE, YOU KNOW, THE DREAM OF HER\nHAVING OPEN BORDERS IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE --\nMARTHA: GOTCHA. >> -- FOR 600 MILLION PEOPLE.\nTHE HAITI PAY-FOR-PLAY AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE THERE.\nTHE COLLISION -- HER COLLUSION WITH THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THAT\nYOU WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT.

BUT IN 1989 WE WERE TRYING TO DO\nONLY REFINANCING OF THE UNIVERSITY WITH STEVENS INC. OF\nLITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS, AND THEY BROUGHT WITH THEM THE ROSE LAW\nFIRM.

I'VE GOT THE WHOLE GROUP, AND\nTHEY WERE THE MOST CONDESCENDING, RUDE GROUP OF\nPEOPLE I'VE EVER DEALT WITH IN MY PROFESSIONAL CAREER.\nAND IT'S JUST PAR FOR THE COURSE.\nMARTHA: YEAH. >> THESE PEOPLE LOOK DOWN THEIR\nNOSES AT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND THAT'S WHY TRUMP HAS DONE SO\nWELL. HE'S -- IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A\nGRASSROOTS MOVEMENT WITH TRUMP. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE\nREPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT DOES, TRIES TO DO TO DONALD TRUMP,\nBECAUSE THEY'RE NOT WHERE HE GOT HIS POWER --\nMARTHA: LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION --\n>> HE'S ALL ABOUT THE PEOPLE. YES.\nMARTHA: IN TERMS OF THE EVANGELICAL VOTE, I THINK AMONG\nSOME TRUMP SUPPORTERS NOW THERE'S SOME CONCERN THAT GIVEN\nTHESE STORIES THAT ARE GOING OUT, THAT THEY ARE GOING TO\nQUESTION WHETHER OR NOT MORALLY IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO.\nAND SOME OF THEM MAY DECIDE TO STAY HOME.\nWHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT? >> UNLIKE HILLARY CLINTON, I\nHAVE FAITH IN THE INTELLIGENCE AND THE SAVVY OF THE AMERICAN\nPEOPLE, OF EVANGELICALS. AND THEY BETTER THAN ANYBODY\nELSE UNDERSTAND THAT CHRISTIANITY IS ABOUT\nFORGIVENESS, IT'S ABOUT REPENTANCE, AND THEY'VE SEEN THE\nCHANGE IN DONALD TRUMP. I'VE SEEN IT PERSONALLY.\nHE'S NOT THE SAME PERSON HE WAS ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE\nYEARS AGO. HE'S, HE'S LEARNED SO MUCH FROM\nTHE PEOPLE. SINCE HE'S BECOME A POLITICIAN,\nHE'S SEEN THE SUFFERING OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\nTHAT'S POSITIVELY INFLUENCED HIM.\nAND I TALKED TO HIM LAST NIGHT.

THAT'S WHY HE RELEASED A\nSTATEMENT LAST NIGHT THAT -- CATEGORICALLY DENYING ALL THE\nACCUSATIONS. MARTHA: YEAH.\n>> BUT HE'S A DIFFERENT MAN THAN THE MAN YOU SAW ON THAT\nVIDEOTAPE A FEW YEARS AGO, 11 YEARS AGO.\nAND HE TRULY WANTS WHAT'S BEST FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, I\nBELIEVE STRONGLY.

THIS IS THE ONE, THOUGH,\nCONGRESSMAN THAT REALLY DOES SEEM TO BE BUSYING THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN RIGHT NOW. AND THERE'S ACTUALLY A STATEMENT\nNOW FROM HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN.\nHE'S TALKING ABOUT AN E-MAIL THAT WAS IN THIS BATCH OF WHAT\nWAS HACKED WHERE YOU HAVE THE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR THE\nCAMPAIGN YEARS BEFORE THIS CAMPAIGN STARTED TALKING ABOUT\nCATHOLICISM AND HOW THIS IS A MORE SOCIALLY ACCEPTED CHOICE,\nBASICALLY FOR REPUBLICANS OR FOR CONSERVATIVES THAN EVANGELICALS,\nBECAUSE THEIR RICH FRIENDS WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND IF THEY\nBECAME EVANGELICALS. SOMEONE ELSE E-MAILS TO JOHN\nPODESTA THAT IT'S A BASTARDIZATION OF THE FAITH.\nSO THIS GIVES PAUL RYAN, A CATHOLIC, THE MOST PROMINENT\nMEMBER OF CONGRESS, FODDER FOR SURE.\nAND HE SAYS, THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN'S DISDAIN FOR THE\nCATHOLIC FAITH AND CHRISTIAN EVANGELICALS IS STAGGERING.\nTHESE STATEMENTS REVEAL THEIR HOSTILE ATTITUDE OF PEOPLE OF\nFAITH IN GENERAL. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF\nAMERICA. ALL AMERICANS OF FAITH SHOULD\nTAKE A LONG, HARD LOOK AT THIS AND DECIDE IF THESE THERE VALUES\nWE WANT TO BE REPRESENTED IN OUR NEXT PRESIDENT.\nIF HILLARY CLINTON CONTINUES TO EMPLOY PEOPLE WITH BIASED AND\nBIGOTED VIEWS, IT'S CLEAR WHERE HER PRIORITIES LIE.\nHOW DO YOU THINK THE CAMPAIGN SHOULD APPROACH THIS?\n>> WELL, SPEAKER RYAN CLEARLY IS GRASPING FOR STRAWS.\nHE'S HAD A ROUGH COUPLE OF DAYS IN TERMS OF THE BACK AND FORTH\nWITH DONALD TRUMP AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AS WE KNOW IT\nIS IMPLODING. I DO THINK TO THE EXTENT WE CAN\nCONFIRM THAT THERE WAS AN E-MAIL THAT WAS WRITTEN DISCUSSING\nCATHOLICISM AND/OR EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANS IN SUCH AN\nINSENSITIVE WAY, I WOULD ENCOURAGE THEM TO TAKE ACTION AT\nTHE STAFFERS. I THINK WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO\nCELEBRATION RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE AND DIVERSITY.\nBY THE WAY, IT'S QUITE IRONIC, BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN\nPERHAPS THE MOST RELIGIOUSLY INTOLERANT PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATE IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY.\n>> BUT CERTAINLY THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT HILLARY CLINTON\nWANTS TO BE, YOU KNOW, THAT'S REALLY -- SHE'S PROBABLY TRYING\nTO SET HER OWN BAR WHEN SHE COMES TO THIS.\nSHE IS A WOMAN OF FAITH. YOU'RE A MAN OF FAITH.\nSO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS, WHERE DO YOU THINK THE CONVERSATION\nSHOULD BE? YOU SAY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT\nSHOULD BE BROUGHT UP WITH THE STAFFER, BUT HOW SHOULD THE\nCAMPAIGN DEAL WITH THIS IN A WAY THEY MAY BE TURNING OFF PEOPLE\nOF FAITH THAT READ THIS, AND THEY FEEL EXCLUDED AND LIKE\nTHEY'RE BEING BASICALLY TOLD BY SOMEONE WHO MAY BE TALKING ABOUT\nBEING SORT OF ELITIST THAT THEIR RELIGION DOESN'T MATTER AS MUCH\nOR DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IN THE POLITICAL SCHEME OF THINGS.\n>> WELL, I HAVE EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE CAMPAIGN WILL\nTAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO THE STAFF MEMBER ON\nQUESTION ON THIS ISSUE. IF YOU THINK ABOUT HILLARY\nCLINTON'S LIFE JOURNEY, SHE'S BEEN ALL ABOUT DIVERSITY,\nRELIGIOUS, RACIAL, ETHNIC TOLERANCE, AND EMBRACING WHAT'S\nGOOD IN AMERICA AND A LARGE PART OF THAT IS OUR TREMENDOUS\nDIVERSITY. IT'S A GREAT STRENGTH.\nI THINK WHAT WE HAVE WITH SPEAKER RYAN, HE'S TRYING TO\nCHANGE THE SUBJECT BECAUSE HIS MAJORITY IS IN PERIL RIGHT NOW,\nAND IF YOU ACTUALLY EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TRUMP AND\nWHAT HE SAID AND HOUSE REPUBLICANS AND WHAT THEY'VE\nDONE, IT'S A VERY CLOSE PARALLEL.\nDONALD TRUMP TALKS RECKLESSLY, BUT IT WAS THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN\nMAJORITY THAT ACTUALLY RECKLESSLY SHUT DOWN THE\nGOVERNMENT FOR 16 DAYS AND COST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE $24 BILLION\nIN LOST ECONOMIC PRODUCTIVITY. DONALD TRUMP TALKS ABOUT\nBUILDING A WALL AND KEEPING THE MUSLIMS AND MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS\nOUT. THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY\nHAS ACTUALLY STOPPED BIPARTISAN, COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM\nFROM MOVING FORWARD. ON ISSUE AFTER ISSUE, WE LOOK AT\nGUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION LEGISLATION.\nTHE HOUSE REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE HAS ACTED LIKE A WHOLLY OWNED\nSUBSIDIARY OF THE NRA BECAUSE THEY'VE STOPPED THINGS LIKE\nUNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE EMBRACE.\nSO WE CAN HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE, BUT\nPAUL RYAN IS TRYING TO CHANGE THE TOPIC.\n>> I WANT TO ADD THAT THE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR WHO\nSPOKE ABOUT THE PART OF CATHOLICISM BEING MORE SOCIALLY\nACCEPTABLE POLITICALLY FOR CONSERVATIVES.\nI JUST WANT TO POINT OUT SHE HAS RESPONDED TO THIS, SAYING SHE\nDOESN'T RECOGNIZE THE E-MAIL AND POINTS OUT THAT SHE'S CATHOLIC.\nI WANT TO ASK YOU, THE GOVERNOR OF MINNESOTA SAID TODAY THAT THE\nAFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS NO LONGER AFFORDABLE.\nIS HE WRONG? >> HE'S ABSOLUTELY WRONG.\nFIRST OF ALL, THERE ARE MORE THAN 20 MILLION PREVIOUSLY\nUNINSURED PEOPLE WHO HAVE AFFORDABLE HEALTH COVERAGE\nBECAUSE OF THE ACA. THE ENTIRE NATION NOW DOESN'T\nHAVE TO WORRY ABOUT BEING DENIED COVERAGE AS A RESULT OF A\nPREEXISTING CONDITION -- >> AREN'T SOME PEOPLE --\n>> IT IS A REASONABLE DISCUSSION FOR US TO HAVE WHEN THIS\nPRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS OVER AND WE CONVENE THE NEXT CONGRESS\nON JANUARY 3rd, AS TO HOW WE CAN BUILD UPON THE SUCCESS OF THE\nACA AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS. THAT WAS DONE WITH SOCIAL\nSECURITY OVER THE YEARS. THAT WAS DONE WITH MEDICARE AND\nMEDICAID. IT'S REASONABLE TO SAY IT SHOULD\nBE DONE WITH THE ACA. BUT THE FOUNDATION OF THE LAW IS\nSOLID AND IT'S BEEN A BENEFIT TO AMERICAN PEOPLE.\n>> CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US HERE IN \"THE\nSITUATION ROOM.\" AND FOR BEING SO GENEROUS WITH\nYOUR TIME WITH US. WE APPRECIATE IT.\n>> THANK YOU.",

WE'VE SEEN THIS AS A PATTERN.\nTHE WAY HE DESCRIBES WHAT IS IN THE WIKILEAKS E-MAILS IS MUCH\nMORE SENSATIONAL AND MUCH MORE OFFENSIVE THAN THEY ACTUALLY\nREAD ON PAPER. I THINK THIS IS, WE ALLUDED TO\nSEVERAL OF THE PEOPLE ON THAT E-MAIL CHAIN BEING CATHOLICS\nTHEMSELVES. I THINK PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THEIR\nOWN FAITH IN PRIVATE DIFFERENTLY THAN YOU WOULD THINK A\nPOLITICIAN TO TALK ABOUT IT IN PUBLIC.\nDONALD TRUMP IS UNDERPERFORMING PAST REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL\nNOMINEES WITH THE CATHOLIC VOTE WHICH IS A REALLY SERIOUS\nPROBLEM, PARTICULARLY IN THE MID-WESTERN STATE WHERE HE BET\nTHE WHOLE FARM OF HIS CAMPAIGN.

THIS ISN'T THE WIKILEAKS STUFF,\nTHIS IS ABOUT A FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST THAT CAME\nFORWARD AND THIS, ONCE AGAIN, APPEARS TO SHOW THAT THERE WAS\nNOT A FIREWALL BETWEEN THE CLINTON FOUNDATION AND THE STATE\nDEPARTMENT. DURING THE HAITI EARTHQUAKE, THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION WAS TRYING TO FLAG THE STATE DEPARTMENT TO GET\nATTENTION FOR FRIENDS OF BILL CLINTON SO THAT THEY COULD BE\nFIRST IN LINE. FOR WHAT?\nMAYBE FOR AID TO HAITI, MAYBE IT WAS FOR TRAVEL TO HAITI.\nBUT EITHER WAY A STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL RESPONDED\nTHIS WAY. NEED YOU TO FLAG WHEN PEOPLE ARE\nFRIENDS OF WILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON.\nMOST I COULD PROBABLY ID, BUT NOT ALL.\nJACKIE, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS, THAT, ONCE AGAIN, IT DOES\nSHOW COLLUSION OR A COZY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO.\n>> YEAH, THIS ISN'T GOOD. THIS GOES BACK TO WHAT WE'VE\nBEEN DISCUSSING ABOUT THE CLINTON STATE DEPARTMENT,\nCLINTON FOUNDATION NARRATIVE THIS ENTIRE TIME.\nIT DOES LOOK LIKE PEOPLE THAT WERE CLOSE TO THE CLINTONS WERE\nGETTING BETTER ACCESS TO PEOPLE WITH POWER.\nAND PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THAT. IT'S NOT PLAYING BY THE NORMAL\nRULES AND THAT'S SOMETHING THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS EFFECTIVELY\nUSED AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON. SO, YOU HAVE TO WONDER IF\nTHEY'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THIS MORE TODAY.\nBUT THIS CONTINUES -- THIS IS WHY THE E-MAILS ARE A PROBLEM\nFOR HILLARY CLINTON, MUCH MORE SO THAN SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS\nTHAT ARE COMING OUT OF THE WIKILEAKS.\n>> WE'LL BE FOLLOWING IT, PANEL.",

SHE DIDN'T TAKE IT HEAD ON.\nSHE DIDN'T WANT TO DEAL WITH THAT ISSUE.\nWHAT ABOUT THIS? >> I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT\nTHING ABOUT A CAMPAIGN IS MAKE IT ABOUT THE VOTERS, NOT\nYOURSELF OR EVEN YOUR OPPONENT. THE TRUTH IS THESE ARE COMING\nOUT BECAUSE IT CAME FORWARD. THE WORST THING THAT DONALD\nTRUMP HAS DONE FOR AMERICA IS HIJACKING OUR ELECTION.\nWE HAVE REAL NEEDS IN THIS COUNTRY.\nREAL NEEDS. AND WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT\nTHEM. >> BUT DO YOU IGNORE WOMEN\nCOMING FORWARD WITH ALLEGATIONS? DOES THAT MAKE HER INSENSITIVE\nTO WHAT THE CLAIMS ARE? >> I'M SURE YOU CAN'T NOT\nREFERENCE IT. MY OWN COUNSEL WOULD BE WHOEVER\nGETS BACK TO ISSUES FIRST WINS. TALK ABOUT PEOPLE'S LIVES.\nAND OTHERS, LOOK AT JOE BIDEN. HE WROTE THE VIOLENCE AGAINST\nWOMEN'S ACT TWO DECADES AGO WHEN HE WAS A SENATOR.\nHE HAS A TRACK RECORD ON THIS AND PEOPLE LIKE THAT MAY BE ABLE\nTO. BUT I DON'T THINK SHE OUGHT TO\nBE JUMPING UP AND DOWN ON THIS. I THINK SHE OUGHT TO GET BACK TO\nTALKING ABOUT HER ISSUES. >> SO, COREY, WILL DONALD TRUMP\nCONTINUE TATALK ABOUT THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST BILL\nCLINTON? >> I THINK WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT\nTHE ISSUES AND TALK ABOUT THE WIKILEAKS WHERE HILLARY CLINTON\nHAS A PUBLIC FACE AND A PRIVATE FACE.\nWALL STREET IS BEST TO REGULATE ITSELF.\nWHAT WE KNOW FOR ONE THING MINIMUM, CHAIRMAN PODESTA NEEDS\nA BETTER JOB OF CONTROLLING HIS TWITTER ACCOUNT.\nTHIS GUY IS AT THE CENTER OF EVERY SINGLE DISCUSSION AND HE\nIS ULTIMATELY AWARE AND ACUTELY AWARE OF THE SPEECHES THAT\nHILLARY CLINTON HAVE MADE TO WALL STREET WHICH IS CONTRARY TO\nWHAT SHE SAYS PRIVATELY. >> YOU BLAME JOHN PODESTA FOR\nBEING CARELESS WITH HIS E-MAILS BUT DO YOU BLAME THE RUSSIANS --\n>> THE U.S. GOVERNMENT SAY IT'S THE RUSSIANS.\nWAIT, HOLD ON A SECOND. >> IF THAT'S THE CASE, THAT'S\nTHE CASE. I DON'T KNOW.\n>> HERE'S THE QUESTION. WHY WOULD YOU RESIST THAT?\n>> I DON'T CARE WHO DID IT. >> IT LOOKS BAD FOR YOUR\nCAMPAIGN THAT YOU GUYS DON'T LIKE TO GIVE NEGATIVE ATTENTION\nTO THE RUSSIANS. >> I DON'T CARE IF IT'S THE\nRUSSIANS, IT THE VIETNAMESE. I KNOW THIS.\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS NEVER SAID THESE ARE NOT AUTHENTIC\nE-MAILS. NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT THIS.\nIF THIS WAS A MUSLIM D-- >> WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO BE A\nCATHOLIC, TOO? LET'S READ THE E-MAIL AND LET\nPEOPLE DECIDE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S DISENINGENUOUS TO PLAY\nRELIGION YOU'RE USING SOMETHING AS A FLASH POINT FOR PEOPLE AND\nLISTEN TO WHAT THEY SAID. LISTEN TO WHAT THEY SAID.\n>> THE CONTEXT IS THAT JOHN HALPIN THE CENTER OF AMERICAN\nPROGRESS IS TRYING TO WRITE TO THE CLINTON PAMCAMPAIGN AND TALG\nABOUT RUPERT MURDOCH WHO HAS DECIDED --\n>> DECIDED TO RAISE HIS KIDS CATHOLIC AND DONE IT WITH A HIGH\nMASS. >> MANY OF THE MOST POWERFUL\nELEMENTS OF THE CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT ARE ALL CATHOLIC.\nMANY CONVERTS. IT'S AN AMAZING BASTARDIZATION\nOF THE FAITH. THEY MUST BE ATTRACTED TO THE\nSYSTEMMATIC THOUGHT AND SEVERELY BACKWARDS GENDER RELATION.\nAND THEN THE COMMUNICATION DIRECTOR OF THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN\nJENNIFER PALMIERI RESPONDS, \"I IMAGINE THEY THINK IT IS THE\nMOST SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE POLITICALLY CONSERVATIVE\nRELIGION. >> THEIR RICH FRIENDS?\nI DON'T HAVE ANY RICH FRIENDS. >> THEY'RE NOT ATTACKING\nCATHOLICISM. YOU KNOW IT.\nYOU SAY YOU WANT TO GET BACK TO ISSUES AND YOU RAISE THIS\nNONSENSE. >> THE ISSUES ARE OPEN BORDER.\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS SAID IN THESE E-MAILS VERY CLEAR.\n>> DO THAT. DON'T TALK ABOUT THE CATH\nCATHOLICISM, THAT'S NOT REAL. >> THERE'S NO POLICY THAT\nCLINTON IS SUGGESTING TO, FOR INSTANCE, BAN ALL CHRISTIANS\nFROM COMING INTO THE COUNTRY. SO, THIS IS AN E-MAIL EXCHANGE\nMAYBE IT IS MALIGNING A CERTAIN RELIGION, BUT NOT A POLICY.\n>> THESE ARE THE PEOPLE SHE'S SURROUNDING HERSELF WITH THAT\nARE MALIGNING CATHOLICS. >> THEY'RE NOT MALIGNING\nCATHOLICS. >> DO YOU SEE THIS AS MALIGNING\nCATHOLICS? >> NO, OF COURSE IT'S NOT.\nTHESE ARE FAITHFUL CATHICS. I DON'T HALPIN, BUT PEOPLE WHO\nHAVE CONVERTED OR RAISED THEIR CHILDREN AND IT'S THE KIND OF\nTHING PEOPLE SAY IN PRIVATE. I WANT TO GET BACK TO THE\nRUSSIANS, THOUGH. I THINK IT'S VERY INTERESTING\nTHAT COREY SLIPPED, THE RUSSIANS COMMITTED A CRIME.\nTHEY HACKED HILLARY OR JOHN PODESTA'S E-MAILS AND DOING IT\nTO HELP TRUMP. >> THERE IS NO PROOF THAT\nTHEY'RE DOING THIS TO HELP -- >> THERE IS PROOF THAT TRUMP IS\nRUNNING THIS NEW AD THAT THROWS THESE THREATS TO AMERICA.\nA PRO-DEMOCRACY ACTIVIST FROM RUSSIA.\nHE SAID, YOU NOTICE WHAT'S NOT IN THERE?\nRUSSIA. A GREAT THREAT TO AMERICA.\nTRUMP IS PRO-PUTIN AND PRO-RUSSIAN AND OVERRUN HIS OWN\nRUNNING MATE AND SIDED WITH PUTIN OVER PENCE.\nWHY IS HE DOING THAT? WHY IS PUTIN INVOLVED IN OUR\nELECTION? >> LAST WORD, COREY.\n>> A PERSON THAT -- >> VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS DIRECT\nKNOWLEDGE OF THIS -- >> YOU THINK THAT RUSSIA WOULD\nHACK AND THAT PUTIN WOULDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT?\n>> THAT THIS IS DESIGNED TO HELP DONALD TRUMP.\n>> WHY ARE YOU DEFENDING THIS SITUATION SO MUCH?\nYOU CALL THIS ANTI-CATHOLIC RHETORIC WITH NO BASIS BUT PUTIN\nYOU GIVE HIM A HARD DEFENSE. >> WHY DON'T WE TALK ABOUT WHAT\nIS IN THE WIKILEAKS SHE IS OPEN BORDERS WHICH FOR 18 MONTHS SHE\nSAID, NO, NO, NO, I'M NOT FOR OPEN BORDERS AND THEN WE SEE SHE\nIS FOR OPEN BORDERS. >> GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE TO GO.\nCOREY, PAUL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\n>> MAYBE WE'LL CONTINUE OVER COFFEE.\n>> DECAF.",

RICHARD?\n>> Reporter: WELL, GOOD MORNING. THIS IS A FAIRLY COMPLICATED\nSTORY THAT GOES BACK OVER A YEAR.\nBUT WHICH ESCALATED QUITE DRAMATICALLY OVERNIGHT.\nWHAT HAPPENED OVERNIGHT IS THE U.S. NAVY FIRED TOMAHAWK CRUISE\nMISSILES. THE PENTAGON IN A STATEMENT SAID\nSEVERAL TOMAHAWK MISSILES WERE LAUNCHED TO DESTROY RADAR\nINSTALLATION IN REBEL-HELD AREAS OF YEMEN.\nTHESE ARE RELATIVELY REMOTE AREAS ACCORDING TO THE PENTAGON.\nNOT AREAS WHERE YOU WOULD EXPECT TO SEE MANY CIVILIANS OR\nPOTENTIALLY CIVILIAN CASUALTIES. BUT THE REASON I SAID IT'S\nCOMPLICATED IS YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING IN\nTHE LARGER CONTEXT. FOR OVER A YEAR, THERE HAS BEEN\nA WAR BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA AND REBELS IN YEMEN.\nTHE UNITED STATES IS BACKING THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT IN THAT WAR.\nAND BECAUSE OF THAT SUPPORT FOR SAUDI ARABIA IN REBEL HELD AREAS\nOF YEMEN, THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF ANTI-SAUDI, ANTI-AMERICAN\nSENTIMENT. THAT SENTIMENT BOILED UP.\nTHE REBELS FIRED FIRST OVER THE WEEKEND.\nA FAILED ATTACK ON U.S. WARSHIPS IN THE RED SEA.\nAT THE TIME THE U.S. SAID IF THIS HAPPENS AGAIN, THERE WOULD\nBE A RESPONSE. IT DID HAPPEN AGAIN YESTERDAY.\nTHERE WAS ANOTHER FAILED ATTACK FROM THE YEMENI COAST ON U.S.\nWARSHIPS. AND THEN IN THE EARLY MORNING\nHOURS WE SAW THIS RESPONSE WITH TOMAHAWK CRUISE MISSILES BEING\nLAUNCHED. >> RICHARD, IS THIS IN ANY WAY\nRELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENTS IN SYRIA OVER THE LAST MONTH OR SO.\nAND IF IT'S NOT RELATED, GAUGE FOR US THE LEVEL OF IMPORTANCE\nVERSUS THOSE DEVELOPMENTS. >> Reporter: IT'S NOT RELATED.\nIT'S RELATED ONLY IN SO MUCH THAT THE -- IT'S ANOTHER\nCONFLICT IN THE MIDDLE EAST. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE CONFLICT\nIN SYRIA, SO YOU HAVE THE CONFLICT IN SYRIA BEING LED BY\nTHE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT BASHAR AL ASSAD BACKED BY\nRUSSIA. AND THAT ALLIANCE HAS RECEIVED\nWORLDWIDE CONDEMNATION BECAUSE OF THE MOUNTING CIVILIAN\nCASUALTIES. WELL, THERE IS ALSO A PARALLEL\nWAR GOING ON WITH THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT ATTACKING THE REBELS\nAND KILLING MANY CIVILIANS IN YEMEN.\nEXCEPT, IN YEMEN IT IS THE UNITED STATES BACKING THE SAUDI\nGOVERNMENT. AND THERE ARE SOME IN THE U.S.\nWHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT THIS ALLIANCE.\nWORRIED THAT THERE COULD BE LEGAL IMPLICATIONS BECAUSE THE\nSAUDI GOVERNMENT IS USING AMERICAN-MADE WEAPONS TO CARRY\nOUT THIS CAMPAIGN. SO IT IS A PARALLEL WAR, BUT A\nWAR WHERE MANY CIVILIANS ARE DYING IN WHICH JUST ESCALATED\nTHIS MORNING WITH THE U.S. TAKING OVER THIS MILITARY\nACTION. >> SHOULD THE U.S. EXPECT ANY\nKIND OF RESPONSE, EITHER FROM THIS COUNTRY DIRECTLY OR ANY OF\nITS PATRONS? >> IT'S\nTHEM TO LAUNCH MORE ATTACKS ON U.S. WARSHIPS BECAUSE THESE\nRADAR SYSTEMS THAT WERE TARGETED, THESE THREE RADAR\nSYSTEMS THAT WERE ALLEGEDLY DESTROYED ACCORDING TO THE\nMILITARY IN REBEL-HELD TERRITORY WERE THE SAME RADAR SYSTEMS THAT\nWERE USED TO TARGET THE AMERICAN WARSHIPS.\nSO NOW THAT THE RADAR SYSTEMS ARE GONE, ONE WOULD ASSUME IT\nWOULD BE MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO LAUNCH THE ATTACKS.\nBUT IT IS CERTAINLY NOT OVER. WILL WE SEE MORE OF AN\nESCALATION IS AN OPEN QUESTION. ANOTHER THING TO KEEP IN\nCONTEXT, THERE WAS A PARTICULAR INCIDENT IN YEMEN OVER THE\nWEEKEND THAT SEEMS TO HAVE TRIGGERED ALL OF THIS.\nTHERE WAS A SAUDI AIR STRIKE THAT KILLED 140 PEOPLE AT A\nFUNERAL. SAUDI ARABIA LATER SAID IT\nREGRETTED THE INCIDENT, HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH SAID IT'S A\nPOSSIBLE WAR CRIME. AND IT WAS RIGHT AFTER THAT\nINCIDENT WHICH OUTRAGED MANY PEOPLE IN YEMEN THAT THE YEMENI\nREBELS LAUNCHED THEIR FIRST FAILED ATTACK ON THE U.S.\nWARSHIP. AND THEN AGAIN LAUNCHED THE\nOTHER ONE. SO PERHAPS THIS IS A LIMITED\nINCIDENT, A RESPONSE TO THAT VERY VIOLENT INCIDENT, A VERY\nRISKY AND AGGRESSIVE RESPONSE FROM THE YEMENI REBELS.\nBUT MAYBE THERE WOULD BE MORE. >> OPPOSED TO AN ESCALATION.\nRICHARD, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING.\nTHAT'S RICHARD ENGEL.",

BUT I'M HAPPY TO DISCUSS THE\nE-MAILS, BECAUSE I THINK, ONE, IF YOU ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE BACK\nAND FORTH BETWEEN PODESTA AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE CAMPAIGN,\nTHAT'S THE NORMAL GIVE AND TAKE THAT OCCURS IN TERMS OF TRYING\nTO DETERMINE WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE STRATEGY IN THE\nCONTEXT OF A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN WHERE YOU HAVE AN\nINTENSE MEDIA SPOTLIGHT AND YOU'RE RUNNING FOR THE MOST\nDIFFICULT JOB IN THE WORLD. AND SO IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME THAT\nTHERE'S ANYTHING THAT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN SHOULD BE\nDEFENSIVE ABOUT OR HAS BEEN DEFENSIVE ABOUT IN TERMS OF\nTHESE E-MAILS. >> I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT SOME\nOF THEM, THOUGH. BECAUSE SOME OF THEM WE SEE THE\nTOPICS OF THE SPEECHES THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN GIVING,\nAND QUITE FRANKLY, A LOT OF THEM SHOW HER SUCKING UP TO WALL\nSTREET, AS SHE SPEAKS BEFORE PEOPLE IN SPEECHES WHERE SHE'S\nBEING PAID HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS,\nTALKING ABOUT HOW DODD-FRANK WAS PASSED AND NEEDED TO BE DONE,\nTHAT IS THE FINANCIAL REFORM BILL THAT PASSED AFTER THE\nECONOMY NEARLY COLLAPSED. SHE ALSO SAID TO PEOPLE ON WALL\nSTREET, YOU HAVE TO KEEP LOOKING OVER THE HORIZON.\nSHE GAVE THEM SOME CREDIT FOR INVENTING PRODUCTS THAT NOBODY\nHAS INVENTED. I MEAN, WHEN YOU THINK OF\nPRODUCTS NOBODY HAD INVENTED, AT ONE POINT, THAT WAS THE MORTGAGE\nBACKED SECURITY THAT LED TO THIS ECONOMIC DISASTER IN THE\nCOUNTRY. VOTERS ARE SEEING THIS, AND\nTHEY'RE DRAWING CONCLUSIONS ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON BEING TOO\nCUDDLY WITH WALL STREET. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE VOTERS\nWHO ARE UNDECIDED IN THIS ELECTION AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT\nTHIS? >> I WOULD SUGGEST THAT PEOPLE\nACTUALLY LOOK AT HILLARY CLINTON'S TRACK RECORD.\nSHE WENT EIGHT YEARS IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE WHERE SHE\nWAS REPRESENTING WALL STREET. CASE IN POINT, AFTER GEORGE BUSH\nWAS RE-ELECTED IN 2004, HIS TOP POLITICAL PRIORITY WAS\nPRIVATIZING SOCIAL SECURITY, WHICH OBVIOUSLY WOULD HAVE BEEN\nA BOOM TO WALL STREET, BECAUSE YOU WOULD HAVE HAD BILLIONS, IF\nNOT TRILLIONS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN MANAGED BY WALL STREET\nFOLKS. HILLARY CLINTON, ALONG WITH\nOTHER MEMBERS, DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES\nSENATE, STOOD UP AND PUSHED BACK AND ACTUALLY STOPPED THAT.\nON THE ISSUE OF TRADE, WHICH MANY PEOPLE ON WALL STREET\nSUPPORT, THIS WAS ONLY ONE MAJOR FREE TRADE AGREEMENT THAT CAME\nBEFORE HILLARY CLINTON DURING THE EIGHT YEARS THAT SHE WAS A\nMEMBER OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE, THAT WAS KAFTA.\nAND HILLARY CLINTON VOTED NO. AND SO I'M VERY COMFORTABLE WITH\nTHE FACT THAT HILLARY CLINTON, AS PRESIDENT, WILL CONTINUE TO\nSTAND UP ON THE SIDE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, BECAUSE THAT'S\nEXACTLY WHAT SHE DID DURING HER EIGHT YEARS IN THE UNITED STATES\nSENATE ON ISSUE AFTER ISSUE. >> IN THE DISCUSSION OF TRADE,\nKAFTA IS SMALL TRY COMPARED TO NAFTA WHICH SHE SUPPORTED AND\nTHE TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP, REALLY THE TRADE ACCOMPLISHMENT\nTHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS HOPING FOR DURING HIS TIME IN THE WHITE\nHOUSE. AND SHE REPEATEDLY, DOZENS OF\nTIMES, PUSHED IT AS SECRETARY OF STATE, ONLY FLIP-FLOPPING ON HER\nPOSITION ONCE SHE WAS A CANDIDATE.\nAND IT APPEARED THERE WASN'T AN APPETITE FOR IT AMONG HER\nELECTORATE. >> ACTUALLY, YOU'VE GOT THREE\nIMPORTANT TRADE AGREEMENTS THAT YOU JUST LAID OUT.\nTHE FIRST ONE WAS NAFTA. THAT'S BILL CLINTON'S.\nSHE WAS THE FIRST LADY -- >> SHE SUPPORTED IT.\n>> SHE SUPPORTED IT, AND THAT'S PART OF THE RECORD.\nBUT SHE WAS THE FIRST LADY AT THE TIME.\nKAFTA IS A SIGNIFICANT TRADE AGREEMENT, A VERY CLOSE SECOND\nTO NAFTA. AND SHE VOTED NO.\nWITH RESPECT TO THE TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP, WHICH IS A VERY\nSIGNIFICANT AGREEMENT, WHEN SHE WAS PART OF THE OBAMA\nADMINISTRATION, IF YOU ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT THE TIMING OF HER\nWORDS, WHAT SHE WAS SUGGESTING IS THAT THE NEGOTIATION THAT IS\nTAKING PLACE WOULD BE A GOLD STANDARD HOW -- AT A TIME WHEN\nWHAT WAS ON THE TABLE REALLY WAS PROVIDING THE PRESIDENT WITH\nFAST TRACK AUTHORITY. WHEN IT WAS TIME FOR THE UNITED\nSTATES CONGRESS TO ACTUALLY VOTE ON THAT FAST-TRACK AUTHORITY,\nWHEN WE HAD SOME SENSE OF WHAT THAT FRAMEWORK LOOKED LIKE, WHEN\nTHERE WAS SOME MEAT THAT WAS PUT ON THE BONES, SHE CAME OUT\nAGAINST IT. I THINK THAT'S A REASONABLE\nPOSITION. IT'S VERY HARD TO TAKE A\nPOSITION AGAINST SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE NOT SEEN, AND SO, WHEN\nYOU THINK ABOUT THE TIMING AS IT RELATES TO TPP, I'M VERY\nCOMFORTABLE IN HER POSITION. >> I WILL ADD THAT HER SUPPORT\nFOR IT AS SECRETARY OF STATE SHE NEVER SAID WAS CONTINGENT ON THE\nOUTCOME. BUT THAT IS YOUR OPINION, AND\nI'M HERE STATING THE FACTS AS WE SEE THEM ABOUT HER STATEMENTS.\nI DO WANT TO HAVE YOU HANG AROUND, CONGRESSMAN.\nWE HAVE A LOT MORE TO TALK ABOUT.\nHOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN JUST WEIGHED IN ON ONE OF THESE\nE-MAILS REVEALED IN THIS RUSSIAN HACKING OF THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN'S CHAIRMAN'S E-MAILS. WE'LL TELL YOU WHAT HE SAID AND\nDISCUSS THAT AFTER A BREAK.",

AND THEN I PUT IT IN CONTEXT AND\nSAID, WELL, IT'S PROBABLY TRUE AND THE FACT THAT HE WOULD BRAG\nABOUT IT JUST IS CONSISTENT WITH HIS OTHER BEHAVIOR THAT I HAD\nSEEN BEFORE. >> SO, AGAIN, YOU DID NOT SEE\nANY PHYSICALLY AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR, BUT YOU DID SEE SEXIST\nBEHAVIOR FROM HIM? WHAT WAS YOUR EXPERIENCE?\n>> INITIALLY LIKE I SAID IT WAS PRETTY GOOD BUT AFTER A WHILE WE\nSTARTED TALKING ABOUT WOMEN IN A DIFFERENT WAY.\n>> SUCH AS? >> WELL, HE WOULD SAY THAT THIS\nWOMAN IS VERY HOT AND SHE WANTS ME AND THAT KIND OF THING.\nBUT THEN HE GOT WEIRD. I MEAN, WE HAD A MEETING WITH AN\nARCHITECT ONCE WHICH WAS REALLY SHOCKING TO ME, OUT OF NO WHERE,\nHE STARTED TALKING ABOUT WOMEN HAVE TO WORK HARDER AND THEIR\nBODIES, HE DESCRIBED THEIR BODIES AS BEING TIGHTER AND\nSTUFF LIKE THAT. THE ARCHITECT AND I LOOKED AT\nEACH OTHER AND WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE THIS CAME FROM.\nBUT, YOU KNOW, AT THE TIME I THOUGHT HE IS HAVING THIS BREAK\nDOWN BECAUSE HIS EMPIRE IS FALLING APART AND MAYBE, YOU\nKNOW, IT'S JUST A TEMPORARY THING.\nBUT, OBVIOUSLY, IT GOT WORSE. >> AND, YET, I WANT TO ASK YOU\nABOUT THE MEMOIR IN 2013 THAT YOU WROTE BECAUSE YOU TALKED\nABOUT HIM AND YOUR TAKE ON HIM WAS DIFFERENT THEN.\nLET ME READ IT FOR EVERYONE. DONALD, FOR ALL OF HIS\nWOMANIZING AND COMMENTARY WAS THE LEAST SEXIST BOSS I EVER\nHAD. AS FAR AS TRUSTING ME AND\nVIEWING ME EQUALLY WITH ALL THE MEN WE ENCOUNTERED IN OUR MUTUAL\nDEALINGS. EXPOUND ON THAT.\n>> THAT'S AN HONEST STATEMENT. HE DID NOT TREAT ME.\nHE DID NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ME AND I DIDN'T SEE HIM\nDSCRIMINATING AGAINST, ALL THE WOMEN HE HIRED WERE VERY\nBEAUTIFUL. BUT AS FAR AS TRUSTING ME, HE\nTRUSTED ME. HE TREATED ME LIKE THE MAN.\nHE YELLED AT ME LIKE HE YELLED AT THE MEN AND CURSED AT ME.\nBUT HE RESPECTED ME. SO, THAT WAS NOT SEXIST.\nHOWEVER, HAVING SAID THAT AND I COULD STILL SAY THAT STATEMENT\nIS TRUE. BASED ON WHAT I KNOW NOW AND\nWHAT I SAW OF HIS COMMENTS IN WRITING AND IN THE PRESS AND THE\nTHINGS THAT HE SAID TO HOWARD STERN, I COULD NEVER SAY THAT HE\nWASN'T A SEXIST BECAUSE HE IS SUCH A BLATANT SEXIST.\nI WOULD JUST RETRACT THAT STATEMENT.\n>> YOU'RE SAYING THAT IN YOUR EXPERIENCE HE TREATED YOU LIKE\nONE OF THE GUYS AND TRUSTED YOU WITH ALL THE HARD WORK, BUT NOW\nTHAT NEW INFORMATION HAS COME OUT, GIVEN WHAT YOU HEARD HIM\nSAY, AS WELL AS ALL THE NEW AUDIOTAPES YOU RES HAVE YOUR\nV VIEW OF HIM.\n>> DON'T FORGET, I WAS IN CONSTRUCTION.\nTHAT'S SUCH A SEXIST BUSINESS. A LOT OF STUFF WENT RIGHT PAST\nME. I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT IT.\nI SPOKE TO SOME WOMEN THAT WORKED THERE AT THE TIME AND I\nWAS REMINDED OF THINGS THAT HE DID AND THE WAY HE LOOKED AT\nWOMEN. HE DID LEER AT WOMEN, NO\nQUESTION ABOUT IT. HE EVEN LEERED AT ME ONCE AT A\nBLACK TIE DINNER. I TOOK IT IN MY STRIDE.\nI DIDN'T SAY, OH, MY GOD, HE'S DOING THIS.\nIT WAS JUST, WELL, HE NEVER SAW ME LIKE THIS.\nI WAS ALWAYS IN CONSTRUCTION CLOTHES OR BUSINESS CLOTHES.\n>> IT WAS A DIFFERENT TIME. EVERYTHING HAS TO BE LOOKED AT\nTHAT OF IT BEING THE '80s. IT WAS A DIFFERENT TIME.\nSO, YOU SUPPORT HILLARY CLINTON? >> I ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT HER.\n>> YOU DO NOT SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP.\nYOU SAY IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE HE'S SEXIST.\nIT'S FOR OTHER REASONS THAT YOU KNOW.\n>> FIRST OF, ALL HE HAS NO EXPERIENCE.\nTHE IDEA THAT HE WOULD BE PRESIDENT IS JUST REDEICULOUS.  I HAVE OTHER DEVELOPERS I\nWORKED FOR AND, I MEAN, YOU NEED TO HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE AND SOME\nKNOWLEDGE OF GOVERNMENT. THE WAY HE SHOWS HIMSELF, HE\nDOESN'T EVEN SEEM TO KNOW BASIC CIVICS.\nBUT THE WORST THING ABOUT TRUMP AND THE REASON NOT TO VOTE FOR\nHIM FOR PRESIDENT IS HIS TEMPERAMENT.\nHE FLIES OFF THE HANDLE AND HE ATTACKS VICIOUS.\nYOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE SHOOTING SOMEONE AND HAVING A NUCLEAR\nBOMB COME BACK AT YOU. HE'S VINDICTIVE AND HE'S\nDISHONEST. HE ALWAYS WAS DISHONEST ALL THE\nTIME I WORKED FOR HIM. WE NEVER KNEW WHEN HE WAS\nTELLING THE TRUTH AND WHEN HE WASN'T.\nAND I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT WE NEED IN A PRESIDENT.\n>> BARBARA RES, WE APPRECIATE GETTING YOUR PERSONAL STORY\nHAVING WORK WOULD HIM FOR SO LONG.\nTHANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.",

THEN IT EVENED OUT OVER SATURDAY\nAND SUNDAY TO 56%-23%. IF YOU LOOK AT THE GENDER GAP IN\nALL THE STATES, THE 538 BLOCK PUT THIS TOGETHER TODAY.\nAND YOU CAN SEE, SHE'S KILLING HIM WITH WOMEN.\nHE'S BEATING HER WITH MEN.

THE CATHOLIC CHURCH NEEDS TO BE\nSHAKEN UP BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO FAR IN THE DARK AGES ESSENTIALLY\nIS WHAT THEY ARE SAYING? >> IN 2012, THERE WAS A BIG\nPLATFORM FIGHT BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO REMOVE ALL VESTIGES IN\nFAITH IN GOD. THEY ARE IN DIRECT OPPOSITION TO\nTHE WORD OF GOD, KNOWING IF THEY CAN GET PEOPLE TO ACCEPT THAT,\nTHEN THEY COMPLETELY OBLITERATE GOD IN OUR SOCIETY.\nTHAT'S THE REAL GOAL. >> YOU BRING UP AA GOOD POINT.\nWHY DONALD TRUMP IS GOING AFTER PAUL RYAN AND THE REST OF\nREPUBLICANS MAKES NO SENSE TO YOU.\n>> NO. WELL, YOU KNOW, THAT'S ENERGY\nTHAT COULD BE EXPENDED, YOU KNOW, EDUCATING THE PEOPLE ABOUT\nTHE PLATFORMS. TO GET ANYBODY TO READ THE\nDEMOCRATIC PLATFORM REPUBLICAN PLATFORM, I THINK THE VAST\nMAJORITY OF AMERICANS WOULD BE APPALLED AT THE DEMOCRATIC\nPLATFORM, BUT KEEPING PEOPLE IGNORANT AND FEETING -- FEEDING\nPROPAGANDA, THAT'S THE MECHANISM THAT THEY LOOK.\n>> YOUR CAMP SAYS ANY REPUBLICAN WHO DOES NOT VOTE FOR DONALD\nTRUMP, ESSENTIALLY THAT'S A VOTE FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\n>> IT IS AND PEOPLE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT YOU ARE VOTING\nAGAINST YOUR CHILDREN AND THEIR FUTURE.\nTHAT IS REALLY THE KEY.

YOU'VE GOT PUTIN TODAY.\nI HAVE SEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THIS.\nIT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT CAN'T POSSIBLY BE TRUTH.\nIF SOMEONE IS UNDERGOING SORT OF SYSTEMATIC ESPIONAGE, IT REALLY\nDOES MATTER WHO IT IS OR WHY THEY'RE DOING IT.\n>> I THINK BOTH ARE TRUE. >> YOU KNOW YOU DON'T KNOW WHO\nSECHT YOU THIS TAX RETURN, YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU BROKE THE LAW\nWHEN THEY STOLE IT AND SEPTEMBER IT TO YOU, AS A JOURNALIST, I\nDON'T CARE IF THEY BROKE THE LAW, AS A JOURNALIST, ALL YOU\nCARE ABOUT REPORTING THE MATERIAL INDEPENDENT OF THE\nSOURCE, BUT IT'S ALSO OBVIOUSLY AN IMPORTANT STORY TO FIND OUT\nWHO IS THE STORY WHO'S HACKING ALL THESE E-MAILS, THAT IS A\nSEPARATE STORY. >> IN THE CASE OF BARSTOW,\nYOU'VE GOT THE \"NEW YORK TIMES,\" SO THERE'S THREE PAGES OF ONE\nTAX RETURN IN 19 # 6, IF IT WAS, HERE'S THE BACK AND FORTH WITH\nIVANKA, ABOUT PEOPLE SHE DOESN'T LIKE.\nTHAT'S WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW AND WE HAVE NEWS CYCLES THAT ARE\nBEING DRIVEN, PRETTY CLEARLY WITH THE INTENT TO DO THIS.\nWHOEVER DID IT REALLY DID WANT TO HAVE THE EFFECTS THEY'RE\nHAVING. >> RIGHT, BUT CHRIS, I MEAN,\nTHIS IS A PRETTY COMMON PROBLEM IN JOURNALIST, WHEN DANIEL\nELSEBURG LEAKED THE PENTAGON PAPERS, HE DIDN'T PICK WHAT TO\nLEAK. THE SAME WITH THE SNOWEDEN\nARCHIVE, WE CURATED IT, WE WENT THROUGH IT CAREFULLY.\nSOURCES GIVE THE INFORMATION, THE PENTAGON PAPERS WERE TAKEN\nWITHOUT AUTHORIZATION, THEY WERE STOLEN AND NO ONE WOULD STAY THE\n\"NEW YORK TIMES\" SHOULDN'T PUBLISH THEM.\n>> THERE'S SNOWEDEN REVELATIONS, THERE'S THE WHISTLE PLOWER\nCATEGORY, CONSCIENCE, THEN THERE'S A CATEGORY OF THE SONY\nHACK, PRETTY CLEARLY SOMEONE WANTED TO HACK SONY TO PUNISH\nTHEM FOR RELEASING A FILM IT BE NORTH KOREA AND IT MASSIVELY\nEMBARRASSED THEM. YOU'VE GOT THE CLIMATEGATE HACK,\nIN WHICH RANDOM SCIENTISTS ARE HACKED TO DISCREDIT THEIR WORK\nAND NOW THIS, IT SEEMS LIKE THE PRESS HAS A DIFFERENT ROLE TO\nPLAY, BECAUSE IT'S SEEMS LIKE THERE'S AN ALLEY-OOP BEING\nPLAYED FOR AN ACTOR WHO'S UP TO SOMETHING THAT'S NEFARIOUS.\n>> THERE ARE TWO REALLY IMPORTANT VALUES, ON THE ONE\nHAND THE NEED TO IMPOSE TRANSPARENCY ON POWERFUL ACTORS,\nAND ARGUABLY EVEN HIGH LEGAL SONY OFFICIALS, AND ON THE OTHER\nHAND TO NEED THE PROTECT PRIVACY.\nTHE IMPORTANT TRADEOFF AS JOURNALISTS THAT YOU HAVE TO\nASSESS IS THIS PERSON POWERFUL ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY THE INVASION\nOF PRIVACY FOR PUBLISHING OR IS THE MATERIAL ENOUGH IN THE\nPUBLIC INTEREST. AND EVERY JOURNALIST IS GOING TO\nGRAPPLE WITH THIS QUESTION. >> DOES JOHN PEDESTA HAVE A\nRIGHT TO PRIVACY? >> I THINK HE HAS A LESSER RIGHT\nTO PRIVACY THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON ON THE STREET, BY VIRTUE\nOF THE FACT THIS HE CEASE ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL PEOPLE ON THE\nPLANET. HE'S GOING TO BE IN THE WHITE\nHOUSE IN A FEW MONTHS, IN TERMS OF HOW HE SHAPES PUBLIC OPINION\nAND WHAT THEY'RE TELLING THE PUBLIC AND NOT TELLING THE\nPUBLIC, THESE ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THING, OF COURSE\nEVERYONE WOULD SAY THE MORE POWERFUL YOU ARE THE LES PRIVACY\nYOU HAVE. IT DOESN'T MEAN HE HAS NO\nPRIVACY, SOME OF THAT STUFF SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED.\nBUT OF COURSE THE MORE POWERFUL YOU ARE, THE MORE TRANSPARENCY\nYOU DESERVE. >> IF THIS ACCELERATES, THIS IS\nNOW A PLAY BOOK, TO ME THE SONY HACK WAS REALLY A TURNINGING\nPOINT. LIKE SONY EXECUTIVES ARE\nPOWERFUL. BUT IT WAS CLEARLY DONE WITH\nTHIS GOAL THAT ACTUALLY ENDED UP WORKING.\nIS THERE AN ANALOGY WITH THE WAY THAT THE MEDIA HAS BEEN\nPROPAGATING ISIS? THERE IS NEWS, THEY HAVE\nMURDERED THIS PERSON IN A HORRIBLE WAY.\nAT FIRST IT WAS LIKE WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE COMPLICIT IN THIS\nESSENTIALLY AWFUL ACT THAT THEY WANT US TO PUBLISH THESE THINGS,\nEVEN THOUGH FRANKLY THERE'S AN ARGUMENT THAT AN ISIS SNUFF FILM\nIS NEWSWORTHY. >> AGAIN, IT'S A BALANCING\nPROCESS, TO SEE SOMEONE FROM ISIS TO CUT THEIR THROAT OFF FOR\nTHE 100th TIME HAS LITTLE NEWS VALUE.\nIT HAS A LITTLE BIT.",

NOW, IT'S A QUOTE, TOTAL\nMELTDOWN, AND THE PIECE'S CO-AUTHOR, WASHINGTON\nCORRESPONDENT FOR \"TIME\" MAGAZINE, ALEX ALTMAN, JOINS US,\nALONG WITH NANCY GIBBS. ALSO AT THE TABLE, AUTHOR AND\nCOLUMNIST FOR THE NEW YORK DAILY NEWS AND MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR, MIKE\nLUPICA. >> NANCY, WHAT WAS THE EDITORIAL\nDECISION TO DO THIS? >> THIS HAS BEEN TRUE ALL YEAR,\nWHERE WE SAY IT CAN'T GET WORSE, CAN'T GET LOWER, NOTHING CAN\nFALL APART, AND THEN IT GETS WORSE.\nBUT THIS WEEK, WHERE HE HIMSELF IS TALKING ABOUT A SCORCHED\nEARTH TO THE MATTRESSES KIND OF CAMPAIGN, IT REALLY IS LIKE\nNOTHING WE HAVE SEEN. THE MELTDOWN IS NOT ONLY HIM.\nIT'S HIS PARTY. IT'S THE OPEN WARFARE.\nTHREE WEEKS IN FRONT OF AN ELECTION.\nIT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET YOUR HEAD AROUND IN HISTORICAL TERMS\nQUITE APART FROM IN REAL TIME. >> ALEX, ANY EVIDENCE HE HAD NO\nCHOICE BUT TO BASICALLY GO TO THE MAP HERE?\n>> WELL, I THINK CERTAINLY HE FEELS HE'S PINNED INTO A BOX,\nTHAT HE IS CERTAINLY ON A TRAJECTORY TO LOSE, AND I THINK\nWHAT HE'S LOOKING TO DO IN A WAY IS LAY SOME, WE CALL IT\nEXCULPATORY GROUNDWORK, TO SAY THAT THE ELECTION WAS RIGGED.\nMY PARTY ABANDONED ME. AND TO NURTURE HIS BASE AT THE\nEXPENSE OVTRYING TO BUILD HIS COALITION.\n>> MIKE, WHAT'S THE LONG-TERM PLAY?\n>> YOU PUT THOSE TWO COVERS TOGETHER, AND IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S\nTHE WICKED WITCH OF THE WEST, AND HE'S SHRINKING AND MELTING\nAT THE SAME TIME. TO ME, IT'S EXTREMELY SYMBOLIC.\nTHIS HAS TURNED INTO POLITICAL PORN.\nI MEAN, FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS OF THIS CAMPAIGN, IT'S GOING TO\nBE BILL CLINTON'S ACCUSERS AGAINST DONALD TRUMP'S ACCUSERS.\nAND IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE THIS CONGA LINE OF ACCUSATIONS.\nAND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WIKILEAKS STUFF, IT'S LIKE HIS\nRUNNING MATE ISN'T PENCE ANYMORE.\nIT'S JULIAN ASSANGE. >> LET ME ASK YOU THIS. DO PEOPLE AT THE END JUST TUNE\nIT ALL OUT? IF IT'S JUST ONE ACCUSATION\nAFTER ANOTHER ACCUSATION AFTER ANOTHER ACCUSATION?\n>> NO, I DON'T THINK THEY DO. I DO THINK THAT THERE'S A\nGENERAL LEVEL OF NOISE THAT YOU'RE UNABLE TO DIFFERENTIATE\nANYMORE WHAT'S IMPORTANT, WHAT'S NOT IMPORTANT.\nAND THE TRICK FOR MR. TRUMP, AS I SEE IT GOING FORWARD, HOW DOES\nHE SAY THAT HIS ACCUSERS ARE NOT CREDIBLE AND THE ACCUSERS OF\nBILL CLINTON ARE CREDIBLE? THAT'S A PRETTY TOUGH TIGHTROPE\nTO WALK. >> THAT IREEITH YOU.\nI THINK IT'S ALSO A TOUGH TIGHTROPE, WILLIE, FOR HILLARY\nTO WALK, SAYING THAT BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF\nDOING THIS, HE'S UNFIT TO SERVE AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES, AS SHE SAID AFTER THE TAPE CAME OUT, WHEN SHE\nCAMPAIGNED PRETTY HARD FOR ANOTHER GUY WHO WAS ACCUSED OF\nDOING THE SAME THING OR WORSE. >> YEAH, IT'S AN UGLY STEW.\nLET'S BE HONEST. IT JUST IS.\n>> YOU THINK? >> LOOK AT IT.\nHERE, WE HAVE A PICTURE, ARTIST RENDERING OF THE STEW RIGHT\nHERE. >> IT GOES WAY, WAY BACK, BUT\nPARTICULARLY JUST THIS WEEK. NANCY, STARTING WITH FRIDAY, THE\n\"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD\" TAPES, THE DEBATE QUESTION SET UP WHERE\nANDERSON COOPER SAID DID YOU DO ANYWAY OF THE THINGS YOU TALKED\nABOUT? AND HE SAID, NO, I DID NOT.\nTHAT ENCOURAGD MANY WOMEN WHO CAME OUT LAST NIGHT, THEY WERE\nMOTIVATED BY HIM SAYING THAT AT THE DEBATE.\n>> THIS ISSUE ALSO HAS 53 PAGES OF ARGUMENTS AND ANALYSIS ABOUT\nTHE POLICY ISSUES THAT WHOEVER WINS IS GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL\nWITH. IT'S FROM TAXES AND DEBT TO THE\nOPIOID EPIDEMIC AND PAYING FOR COLLEGE.\nAND WHAT I THINK IS ESPECIALLY DISCOURAGING TO VOTERS IS THE\nFACT THAT EVERYTHING THAT IS HAPPENING IN FRONT OF US MAKES\nIT HARDER ALMOST BY THE MINUTE FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD.\nIN ANY PRODUCTIVE WAY. >> NANCY, DO YOU FIND WITH THESE\nCOVERS, WHICH ARE DRAMATIC AND TERRIFIC, ARE THEY SELLING?\nARE THEY MOVING THE NEEDLE? BECAUSE JOE AND MIKA WERE SAYING\nTHIS ALL THE TIME, ARE PEOPLE STILL PAYING ATTENTION?\nDO YOU FIND THAT THEY'RE ENGAGED?\n>> THIS IS WHAT'S FASCINATING. PEOPLE ARE MORE ENGAGED, AND WE\nHAVE SEEN THIS BY EVERY METRIC, MORE INTERESTED IN THIS ELECTION\nTHAN ANY IN 20 YEARS. THEY'RE WATCHING DEBATES IN\nHIGHER NUMBERS. PAYING ATTENTION IN HIGHER\nNUMBERS AND OVERWHELMINGLY, THEY'RE DISAPPOINTED BY IT.\nTHEY CAN'T TAKE THEIR EYES OFF IT, IT IS KIND OF A CAR WRECK,\nBUT IT ALSO IS MAKING THEM DEEPLY UNHAPPY AND DISCOURAGED\nAT THE SAME TIME. >> ALEX, CAN YOU PREDICT THE\nNEXT COVER? >> I SHUDDER TO THINK THINGS GO\nLOWER, HOW WE'LL RENDER IT ARTISTICALLY.\n>> WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FROM YOUR REPORTING OVER THE NEXT TWO\nWEEKS. >> THEY SHOULD BE PREPARED FOR\nTHINGS TO GET EVEN UGLIER. I THINK THAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN\nHAS DECIDED THAT, AGAIN, THEIR BEST WAY TO WIN IS PROBABLY TO\nDRIVE DOWN TURNOUT. TO COUNT ON THEIR BASE, AND\nBASICALLY TO GOOSE THEM BY TROTTING OUT A PARADE OF\nACCUSERS OF BILL CLINTON. THEY SIGNALED LAST NIGHT IN AN\nARTICLE IN BUSINESSWEEK THAT THEY HAVE MORE READY TO GO.\nI DON'T THINK THIS IS GOING TO TURN INTO A HIGH-MINDED DEBATE\nON POLICY ISSUES OVER THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS.\nI THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A BARRAGE OF CHARACTER ATTACKS\nCOMING FROM TRUMP TOWARDS CLINTON, AND CLINTON TRYING TO\nFLOAT ABOVE THE FRAY. >> SO MIKE, WE STARTED THIS\nCAMPAIGN WITH THE TWO MOST UNPOPULAR NOMINEES IN AMERICAN\nPOLITICAL HISTORY. AND IT LOOKS BECAUSE OF THE WAY\nTHE CAMPAIGN IS GOING TO END THAT NOBODY IS GOING TO GET OUT\nOF HERE ALIVE. BE IT DONALD TRUMP OR HILLARY\nCLINTON, WHO IS ELECTED AT THE END, THEY'RE GOING TO START WITH\nRICK SCOTT APPROVAL RATINGS. HE STARTED AT GOVERNOR ON THE\nDAY HE WAS SWORN IN WITH LIKE 34%, 35% APPROVAL RATING, AND\nIT'S HARD TO RECOVER. >> THE NEXT COVER WILL BE LIKE\nAN ORANGE SPOT ON YOUR TIE. WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME IS WHAT\nNANCY SAID, PEOPLE ARE MORE ENGAGED AND INTERESTED IN THIS\nCAMPAIGN THAN ANY OTHER IN HISTORY, BUT PART OF THE PLAN\nFOR TRUMP NOW IS TO DRIVE DOWN VOTER TURNOUT.\nDOESN'T IT SEEM LIKE THOSE TWO THINGS ARE COUNTERINTUITIVE?\n>> IT DOES. >> ALEX AND NANCY, THANK YOU\nVERY MUCH. WE'LL LOOK FOR THE NEW ISSUE OF\n\"TIME\" MAGAZINE. A FOLLOW UP TO THE AUGUST ISSUE.\n>> VERY EXCITED TO READ, AND I'M SERIOUS, ABOUT THE POLICY.\nYOU GO THROUGH THE POLICIES, WHETHER IT'S CHILD CARE, HEALTH\nCARE. LOOKING FORWARD TO READING THAT.\n>> MIKE LUPICA, THANK YOU AS WELL.\nWE'RE BACK IN A MOMENT WITH MORE \"MORNING JOE.\"ny                 ,",

I GUESS A BARREL OF BAD NEWS\nTHIS MORNING, JIM? >> WELL, LOOK, I JUST THINK\nTHERE'S A LOT OF NEGATIVITY. IT STARTED IN CHINA.\nNOT GETTING GOOD NUMBERS OUT OF THE EUROPE, BANK STOCKS LOOKING\nBAD. CONGRATULATIONS TO WILFRED ON\nTHE INTERVIEW WITH TIM SLOAN. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ENOUGH.\nIMPORTANT CAVEAT IF SLOAN'S UP FROM A DIFFERENT SIDE OF THE\nBANK. AT THE SAME TIME I DON'T KNOW IF\nCONGRESS WILL UNDERSTAND THOSE SUBTLETIES AND IT IS A SUBTLETY.\nTHERE'S JUST A LOT OF WHAT I REGARD AS BEING SUBOPTIMAL NEWS\nOUT THERE AT A TIME WHEN I STILL THINK PEOPLE WERE KIND OF HOPING\nTHIS PERIOD WOULD BE THE BEGINNING OF A GOOD FEELING\nGIVEN THE FACT I THOUGHT EARNINGS WOULD START OUT OKAY.\nTHEY'RE NOT. >> JIM, THE STOCK OF WELLS FARGO\nCERTAINLY RELATIVE TO WHAT FUTURES ARE DOING IS LOOKING\nPRETTY GOOD OVERNIGHT. AND OF COURSE THEY REPORT\nNUMBERS TOMORROW. EVEN IF POLITICIANS STILL KEEP\nTHE PRESSURE ON THEM, DO YOU THINK THIS COULD BE THE START OF\nTHE END OF THE ISSUES FOR THE STOCK PRICE AT LEAST?\n>> WELL, I THINK SO. GREAT POINT.\nLOOK, THE STOCK PRICE IS HOSTAGE TO FED.\nAND THE MORE FED HIKE TALK YOU GET, THE HIGHER WELLS IS GOING\nTO GO. THAT'S FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAN\nWHATEVER THEY'RE GOING TO DO CROSS SELLING.\nCROSS SELLING WAS JUST SOMETHING THAT KIND OF WE NEVER REALLY\nVALUED AS MUCH AS I THINK THAT THE COMPANY ITSELF VALUED.\nWHAT DOES MATTER IS THE MORTGAGE MARKET, HOW MUCH THEY HAVE OF IT\nAND WHY THEY WERE UNIQUELY POSITIONED FOR RATE RISE.\nTHAT WAS THE POINT OF ALL THE DIFFERENT ACQUISITIONS THEY\nMADE. SO IN A CERTAIN ONE WE'RE NOT\nGOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THIS, ELIZABETH WARREN WILL BE TALKING\nABOUT IT BECAUSE IT'S GREAT FODDER.\nEVERYONE HATES THE BANKS. TERRIFIC STORY.\nEVERYONE UNDERSTANDS, SOMEONE RIPPED YOU OFF.\nOFTENTIMES IT'S ATHEER YAL TO KNOW WHAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT\nWAS DOING ON THE MORTGAGE DEPARTMENT.\nTHIS ISN'T. THEY PUT MONEY IN YOUR ACCOUNT,\nTHEY TOOK IT OUT. NOBODY LIKES IT.\n>> JIM, I KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THESE CONCERNS ABOUT\nEARNINGS SEASON GETTING OFF TO A POOR START, BUT LOOK AT CSX AND\nDELTA. IS THERE SOME GOOD NEWS TO BE\nGLEANED HERE? A SHIFT IN A TREND MAYBE, OR NO?\n>> I'D LIKE TO HEAR MORE FROM THE COMPANIES ITSELF.\nI THINK YOU PICKED TWO INDUSTRIES, ONE CSX, THE\nRAILROADS HAVE BEEN ON FIRE AND THEY DIDN'T GIVE MORE REASON TO\nBE ABLE TO HATE THEM. DELTA IS DOWN 22% FOR THE YEAR\nAND INEXPENSIVE MULTIPLE. I THINK CSX COAL DIDN'T GO UP, I\nTHOUGHT COAL WOULD GO UP OR STABILIZE BECAUSE OF CHINA.\nDELTA, STILL JUST THE SAME OLD BAD.\nTHE MOST IMPORTANT NUMBER THIS MORNING IS ULTA.\nI'VE GOT ULTA ON TONIGHT, MARY DILLON, BECAUSE THERE THE GUIDE\nUP WAS SIGNIFICANT. AND RETAIL LED YESTERDAY.\nTHERE'S REALLY NOT THAT MUCH THAT'S EXCITING.\n>> AMAZING TO SEE ULTA CONTINUE TO EXECUTE.\n>> MARY IS THE BEST. >> PEOPLE GO IN AND PUT ON THE\nMAKEUP, THEY LOVE IT. >> IT'S A SELFIE GENERATION.\nI LIKE GOING OUTSIDE, NO ONE CARES.\nMOST PEOPLE GO OUTSIDE FIRST THING THAT HAPPENS THEY'RE\nTAKING PICTURES FOR FACEBOOK, SNAPCHAT -- SNAP, NOT SNAPCHAT\nANYMORE.
