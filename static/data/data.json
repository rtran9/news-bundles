THAT WAS HILLARY CLINTON.\nNUMBER TWO, DONALD TRUMP SAID HE PUT THIS TO REST.\nHILLARY CLINTON COULDN'T CLOSE IT, GET THE INFORMATION, AND HE\nDID. YOU HEARD HIM SAY THAT PRESIDENT\nOBAMA WAS BORN IN THIS COUNTRY, PERIOD, AND HE'S MOVING ON.\n>> WELCOME BACK TO \"AM JOY.\" THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS STICKING\nTO ITS GUNS THAT HILLARY CLINTON AND HER 2008 CAMPAIGN STARTED\nTHE BIRTHER CONTROVERSY, WHICH OF COURSE IS NOT TRUE.\nDAVID FROM OF THE ATLANTIC. OKAY, GUYS.\nI KNOW THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT LOW IN YOUR EARS.\nWHAT WAS BEING SAID BY KELLYANNE CONWAY THERE IS THAT NOT ONLY IS\nSHE DOUBLING DOWN ON THE IDEA THAT IT IS HILLARY CLINTON'S\nCAMPAIGN THAT STARTED THE BIRTHERISM, SHE SAID, IN FACT,\nTHEY SENT SOMEONE TO AFRICA TO CHECK IT OUT.\nTRUMP WAS NOT RUNNING FOR POTUS AGAINST BARACK OBAMA IN A VERY\nBRUISING PRIMARY IN 2008. THAT WAS CLINTON.\nTRUMP SAID HE PUT THIS TO REST, CLINTON COULDN'T CLOSE IT.\nHE SAID OBAMA WAS BORN IN THE U.S.\nYOUR THOUGHTS? THEY SENT SOMEONE TO AFRICA TO\nCHECK IT OUT. >> BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP AND HIS\nCAMPAIGN -- DONALD TRUMP IS A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR.\nHIS CAMPAIGN IS FILLED WITH PATHOLOGICAL LIARS.\nI WANT PROOF OF THAT STATEMENT THAT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN\nSENT -- >> ISN'T THAT WHO WENT TO --\n>> WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO, THEY'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO\nBASICALLY SHIFT THE ATTENTION FROM DONALD TRUMP SAYING IT WAS\nHILLARY. NO, LET'S KEEP THEM HONEST.\nFOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS, YOU'VE BEEN SAYING THE PRESIDENT OF THE\nUNITED STATES IS -- IS NOT LEGITIMATE BECAUSE HE COMES --\nBECAUSE HE, QUOTE, COMES FROM AFRICA AND MAY BE A MUSLIM.\nWE CAN'T LET HIM GET AWAY WITH THIS.\nLET'S ACTUALLY KEEP THEM HONEST. YOU STARTED THE BIRTHER\nMOVEMENT. OWN IT.\n>> YOU'VE HAD A FORMER MEMBER OF THE DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN, WHO\nI'M GOING TO ASK MY PRODUCERS TO KINDLY REMIND ME OF HIS NAME.\nHE OWNED THE FACT THAT THIS WAS A CAMPAIGN STRATEGY, \"NEW YORK\nTIMES\" PIECE THAT QUOTES HIM SAYING, WE DECIDED TO LATCH ONTO\nTHIS BIRTHER IDEA AS A STRATEGY TO LAUNCH HIM AS A NATIONAL\nFIGURE. WHY ARE THEY SUDDENLY ATTEMPTING\nTO LIE ABOUT IT WHEN THEY'VE OWNED IT IN THE PAST?\n>> DONALD TRUMP IS A VERY AMERICAN CHARACTER.\nTHE PERSON WHO PLAYS ON THE WEAKNESSES AND INSECURITIES OF\nOTHERS TO SELL THEM THINGS THEY WOULDN'T OTHERWISE BUY.\nTHAT'S SOMETHING VERY SOVIET ABOUT HIS CAMPAIGN.\nTHE CONSTANTLY CHANGING LIES AND THE NEED TO SAY, FOR KELLYANNE\nCONWAY, A FORMERLY RESPECTED FIGURE IN AMERICAN POLITICS, TO\nSAY ONE THING ONE DAY AND A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THING THE\nNEXT DAY. THE HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN DID\nGET UP TO A LOT OF MISCHIEF ON THIS FRONT.\nBUT IT WAS KNOWN, MARK PENN'S FAMOUS MEMO WAS PUBLISHED ON THE\nATLANTIC WEBSITE IN 2008. IT'S STILL THERE IF YOU WANT TO\nREAD IT. SYDNEY BLOOMENTHAL, THAT WAS\nREPORTED IN 2009 AND 2010. IT IS VERY HARD TO IMAGINE THAT\nHE COULD BE SHOPPING A STORY TO DOZENS OF REPORTERS AND IT\nREMAIN A SECRET FOR EIGHT YEARS LATER.\nIF HE SHOPPED DOZENS OF REPORTERS AS HE SHOPPED THE\nWHITEY TAPE STORY, THOSE REPORTERS WOULD KNOW ABOUT IT.\nEVEN IF THEY WERE SWORN TO SECRECY DURING THE CAMPAIGN, IT\nWOULD BE IN THEIR POST-CAMPAIGN BOOKS.\n>> ABSOLUTELY. >> SO THE IDEA THAT EIGHT YEARS\nLATER BECAUSE ONE PERSON HAD THIS RECOLLECTION YOU\nNECESSARILY BELIEVE IT. ONE MORE THING ABOUT SENDING THE\nPERSON TO AFRICA. I THINK KELLYANNE CONWAY THERE\nHAS MISTAKEN SOMETHING THAT DID ACTUALLY HAPPEN.\nIT WAS TRUE THAT THE OLD NEWSPAPER -- THEY HAD A NAIROBI\nBUREAU. YOU GET THIS STORY IN 2008.\nIT'S NOT CRAZY YOU WOULD CALL UP YOUR NAIROBI BUREAU CHIEF AND\nSAY LOOK INTO THIS. A HEAVILY PREGNANT WOMAN GOT ON\nA PROP PLANE IN HAWAII AND SPENT A YEAR'S INCOME IN ORDER TO FLY\nFROM L.A. TO NEW YORK AND FROM ROME TO NAIROBI IN ORDER TO GIVE\nHER CHILD THE ADVANTAGES -- [ LAUGHTER ]\n>> FOR THE PURPOSES OF MAKING A PERSON NAMED BARACK HUSSEIN\nOBAMA PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nNONE OF THIS MAKES ANY SENSE. >> THAT'S INCREDIBLE FORESIGHT\nRIGHT. WHAT DAVID WAS SAYING, WE HAVE\nTO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CONTINUE HOLDING THEM ACCOUNTABLE.\nIT'S INCREASINGLY LOOKING LIKE A THIRD WORLD BANANA REPUBLIC\nELECTION WHERE PEOPLE ARE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO INSTIGATE\nAND CAUSE FEAR BY LYING. >> HAVING WRITTEN A BOOK BY THE\nWAY ON THIS -- NOT PLUGGING MY OWN BOOK.\n>> CALLED FRACTURE. >> THIS IS INCIDENT PLAY INTO\nIT. EVERYBODY WHO'S WRITTEN A BOOK\nABOUT HILLARY CLINTON IN ANY SHAPE OR FORM COULD HAVE FOUND\nTHE INFORMATION OUT HAD HER CAMPAIGN BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR\nBIRTHERISM. IT WOULD BE IN MY BOOK, EVERY\nSINGLE BOOK ABOUT THAT CAMPAIGN. LET'S MOVE ONTO THE NEXT THING.\n. YOU TALKED ABOUT THE SOVIET\nNATURE OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. THIS PRESS CONFERENCE THAT TOOK\nPLACE NOT FAR FROM HERE AT DONALD TRUMP'S NEW WASHINGTON,\nD.C. HOTEL. IT WAS NOT A PRESS CONFERENCE.\nIT WAS A COMMERCIAL FOR HIS COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE THAT\nTURNED INTO A 37-SECOND STATEMENT AND A 7-SECOND\nRETRACTION OF BIRTHERISMBIRTHER. THIS IS KELLYANNE CONWAY ON\n\"MEET THE PRESS\". >> I CAN'T BELIEVE SOME OF YOU\nIN THE MEDIA WERE SUPPOSE SET THAT THEY HAD TO GIVE 25 MINUTES\nOF COVERAGE TO THESE INCREDIBLE VETERANS AND MILITARY HEROS WHO\nTOOK THE STAGE. DON'T THEY DESERVE 25 MINUTES OF\nCOVERAGE? PEOPLE GET THEMSELVES UP IN THIS\nTIZZY AND PROJECT ONTO OUR CAMPAIGN.\n>> JONATHAN, I'M GOING TO ASK YOU THIS BECAUSE YOU WORK FOR\nTHE \"WASHINGTON POST.\" IF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAD SAID\nWE'D LIKE YOU TO COME TO A PRESS CONFERENCE ABOUT MILITARY\nVETERANS, WOULD THE POST HAVE SAID ABSOLUTELY NOT?\nIS THE ONLY WAY TO HAVE GOTTEN THEM THERE TO TRICK THEM INTO\nSAYING HE WAS GOING TO RESPOND ON BIRTHERISM?\n>> NO. DONALD TRUMP IS A REPUBLICAN\nNOMINEE. IF HE'S DOING AN EVENT, THE\n\"WASHINGTON POST\" WOULD GO, ASSUMING HE'D LET US IN.\nREMEMBER, ALL THAT MORNING, THE CAMPAIGN WAS TELEGRAPHING MAJOR\nANNOUNCEMENT FROM DONALD TRUMP. EVERYONE THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO\nBE ON BIRTHERISM. AT NO POINT DID I KNOW OR ANYONE\nKNOW THAT THERE WERE GOING TO BE 20 VETERANS ON THAT STAGE WITH\nHIM.",

WHAT SHOULD A PRESIDENT DO TO\nTRY TO DEAL WITH, WITH THIS, WITH THIS THREAT THAT IS NOW\nHITTING THE HOMELAND? >> WITH WELL, CHUCK, IT IS\nREALLY IMPORTANT, AND I WOULD SAY EXPERIENCE REALLY MATTERS.\nAS YOU KNOW, HILLARY CLINTON WAS NEW YORK'S SENATOR ON 9/11 AND\nAT THE WORLD TRADE CENTERS AS THEY WERE LOOKING FOR SURVIVORS\nAND SHE HAS BEEN THROUGH IT, AND IT IS A SEARING EXPERIENCE IN\nHER LIFE AND PART OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM THAT\nWORKED TOGETHER TO REVIVE THE HUNT AND WIPE OUT BIN LADEN AND\nSO IT IS AN IMPORTANT TIME TO HAVE EXPERIENCE.\nYOU HAVE TO SUPPORT THE MILITARY WHICH IS IMPORTANT, BUT ON THESE\nINSTANCES WHETHER THEY ARE IN OUR CITIES OR THE EUROPEAN\nCITIES, THE KEY IS TO HAVELE INTELLIGENCE AND STRONG\nALLIANCES WHERE YOU CAN SHARE THE INTELLIGENCE.\nTHAT IS THE WAY THAT YOU STOP ONE-OFF ATTACKS IS THROUGH THE\nINTELLIGENCE SHARING.

BUT THE CHALLENGE IS THAT AS\nISIS REALIZES THAT THEY ARE LOSING GROUND, THEN THEY SEE\nWHETHER THEY CAN EXPLOIT WEAKNESSES ELSEWHERE.\nSO THE MILITARY STRENGTH TO SHRINK ISIS ON THE GROUND, AND\nTHEN CONTINUE MILITARY STRIKES. >> AND YOU CALLED THE CHOICE\nBETWEEN DONALD TRUMP IN NEW HAMPSHIRE THE OTHER DAY, BETWEEN\nDONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON NEAR EXISTENTIAL, AND IS THAT\nHYPERBOLE, AND DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE EXISTENCE IS AT STAKE\nHERE? >> I THINK THAT, I THINK THAT\nTHE FIDELITY TO THE VALUES IS AT STAKE, CHUCK.\nLET ME ADD THAT I DO THINK THAT IT IS A CONTRAST IN THE VISION,\nAND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I HAVE BEEN DOING ON THE TRAIL IN\nTHE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS IS TO SHOWING THE TWO BOOKS.\nHILLARY HAS A BOOK FILLED WITH ALL OF OUR CAMPAIGN PLATFORMS\nAND POLICIES AND WE CALL IT \"STRONGER TOGETHER.\"\nAND DONALD TRUMP WROTE A BOOK WHEN HE DECIDED TO RUN FOR\nPRESIDENT, AND THE BOOK IS CALLED \"CRIPPLED AMERICA.\"\nTHAT IS THE VISION CHOICE THAT AMERICANS HAVE IN THIS ELECTION,\nAND LET'S JUST USE ONE EXAMPLE. THE EQUALITY PRINCIPLE.\nDONALD TRUMP FOR FIVE YEARS WAS PUSHING THE COMPLETELY FALSE\nNOTION THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA WASN'T BORN IN THE UNITED STATES\nAND WASN'T AN AMERICAN CITIZEN, AND CHUCK IT IS IMPORTANT TO\nKNOW HOW PAINFUL THAT IS TO SO MANY PEOPLE, BECAUSE AS YOU\nKNOW, FROM THE TIME THAT AFRICAN-AMERICANS CAME HERE TO\nJAMESTOWN IN 1619 THROUGH THE DRED SCOTT DECISION IN THE\n1850s, IF YOU WERE AFRICAN-AMERICAN IN THIS\nCOUNTRY, YOU COULD NOT BE A CITIZEN WHETHER YOU WERE SLAVE\nOR FREE OR BORN HERE OR ELSEWHERE, AND YOU COULD NOT BE\nA CITIZEN. AND WE HAD TO FIGHT A CIVIL WAR\nAND CHANGE THE CONSTITUTION TO CHANGE THAT, AND SO WHEN DONALD\nTRUMP FOR FIVE YEARS HAS BEEN PROMOTING THE NOTION THAT AN\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT IS NOT A CITIZEN, THAT IS EXTREMELY\nPOWERFUL AND PAINFUL TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND OOTHERS\nWHO KNOW THIS PAINFUL CHAPTER IN AMERICAN HISTORY.\n>> WHY IS THIS ELECTION SO CLOSE, AND WHY IN THE SUDDEN IN\nTHE LAST THREE WEEKS THE ELECTION HAS GONE WHERE YOU GUYS\nHAD A DURABLE LEAD AND WE CAN DEBATE THE MARGIN OF IT TO NOW\nWHERE HE HAS A VIABLE PATH TO THE PRESIDENCY THAT FRANKLY\nDIDN'T SEEM TO EXIST. HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?\nIF EVERYTHING THAT YOU ARE SAYING IS TRUE, HOW DID THIS\nHAPPEN? >> I U THINK IT IS BECAUSE WE\nARE A CLOSE NATION. YOU KNOW, CHUCK, I COME FROM\nVIRGINIA AND I HAVE BEEN IN CLOSE RACES AND I ENCOURAGED\nSECRETARY CLINTON TO RUN IN APRIL OF 2014 AND I SAID THAT\nYOU WILL BE THE UNDERDOG UNTIL YOU ARE THE WINNER.\nWE CAME IN ESSENTIALLY TIED BUT WENT OUT TO THE PHILADELPHIA\nCONVENTIONS WITH A TIGHT LEAD, BUT IT SETTLED DOWN AFTER THAT\nLEAD, AND IT IS GOING TO BE CLOSE, AND WE HAVE TO MAKE OUR\nCASE EVERY DAY ABOUT THE BASIC PILLARS OF THE CAMPAIGN AND THE\nECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR ALL AND SAFER THROUGH STRONGER ALLIANCES\nAND BUILDING A COMMUNITY OF RESPECT RATHER THAN DISRESPECT.\n>> CLEARLY ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS THAT YOU ARE STRUGGLING TO\nREBUILD THE OBAMA COALITION, AND VOTERS UNDER 35.\nTHIS IS -- I WANT YOU TO TAKE A LISTEN TO SUPPORTERS THAT WE\nTALKED TO YESTERDAY WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO VOTE FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON. >> I THINK IT IS A LACK OF\nTRUST, AND ARE FROM THE RELEASING TRANSCRIPTS AND THE\nBIG SPEECHES ON WALL STREET, AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT BERNIE,\nHIMSELF, BROUGHT OUT IN THE DEBATES AND THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE\nARE STILL HOLDING ON TO, AND THAT IS WHAT I AM HOLDING ON FOR\nA LITTLE BY. >> PEOPLE WHO WERE SO SUPPORTIVE\nOF BERNIE FEEL OFFEND AND BETRAY AND IT IS GOING TO BE TAKING A\nWHILE TO EARN BACK THE TRUST. >> THE MESSAGE WAS NOT DIRECTED\nTOWARDS MILLENNIALS AND THOSE IN COLLEGE AND I THINK THAT BERNIE\nCAN HELP HER WITH THAT. >> AND THE NUMBE",

HIS CAMPAIGN MANAGER SAYS THAT\nVOTERS WANT TO TALK ABOUT ISSUES LIKE SAFETY AND SECURITY AND\nMOVE ON FROM THE BIRTHER CONTROVERSY, WHICH DOMINATED THE\nNEWS ON FRIDAY. NOW HILLARY CLINTON RESPONDED TO\nTHE ATTACKS ALSO. SHE SAID THAT WE HAVE TO SUPPORT\nOUR FIRST RESPONDERS. CLINTON ALSO SAYING WE NEED TO\nPRAY FOR THE VICTIMS IN THIS CASE, SECURITY IS LIKELY TO\nBECOME AN ISSUE THIS WEEK IN THE CAMPAIGNS.\nCLINTON'S RUNNING MATE SENATOR TIM KAINE SAID THAT HE CALLED\nTHE COMMENTS FROM DONALD TRUMP ASKING THE SECRET SERVICE AGENTS\nWHO PROTECT HILLARY CLINTON TO DISARM THEMSELVES, DANGEROUS.\nHE SAID IT SHOWS INDIFFERENCE TO VIOLENCE THAT MAY OCCUR TO THE\nCANDIDATE. NOW DONALD TRUMP MADE THOSE\nCOMMENTS BECAUSE OF HILLARY CLINTON'S STANCE ON GUN CONTROL.\nIT'S A VERY TESTY ELECTION. THE POLLS ARE NARROWING.\nIN FACT, CLINTON IS LOSING GROUND AMONG YOUNGER VOTERS.\nFOR EXAMPLE, IN MICHIGAN, THE NEWEST OR LATEST POLLS SHOW THAT\nCLINTON'S LEAD IS NOW JUST SEVEN POINTS OVER DONALD TRUMP AMONG\nVOTERS UNDER 35 YEARS OLD. LOUISA, CAROLIN.\n>> EDWARD LAWRENCE JOINING US",

CARL, GREAT TO SIGHEE YOU.\nWE WERE JUST HEARING FROM GARY JOHNSON.\nI WAS CURIOUS FOR YOUR IMPRESSIONS.\nDO YOU BELIEVE THAT HE SHOULD BE ON THE DEBATE STAGE IN EIGHT\nDAYS? WE KNOW HE WON'T GET AN\nINVITATION. >> NO, THERE ARE RULES AND HE\nHASN'T MET THE 15% THRESHOLD. AND I WAS THE ONE THAT FIRST\nREPORTED I THINK THAT BILL WELD I BELIEVE IS THINKING ABOUT\nDROPPING OUT OF THIS RACE IF IT LOOKS LIKE HE AND GARY JOHNSON\nMIGHT GET DONALD TRUMP ELECTED. WELD DECEZ SPICES TRUMP.\nI DON'T THINK HE'S MADE UP HIS MIND, BUT IT'S CERTAINLY A POINT\nIF IT LOOKS LIKE SPICES TRUMP. I DON'T THINK HE'S MADE UP HIS\nMIND, BUT IT'S CERTAINLY A POINT IF IT LOOKS LIKESPICES TRUMP.\nI DON'T THINK HE'S MADE UP HIS MIND, BUT IT'S CERTAINLY A POINT\nIF IT LOOKS LIKEZES TRUMP. I DON'T THINK HE'S MADE UP HIS\nMIND, BUT IT'S CERTAINLY A POINT IF IT LOOKS LIKESES TRUMP.\nI DON'T THINK HE'S MADE UP HIS MIND, BUT IT'S CERTAINLY A POINT\nIF IT LOOKS LIKE THAT IT WOULD HELP TOUCHDOWN AND HE WOULD GO\nHELP HILLARY CLINTON. SO STAY TUNED ON THAT.\n>> INTERESTING. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE LAST SEVEN\nDAYS OF HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN.\nHER NEAR COLLAPSE LAST SUNDAY. OFF THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL FOR\nSEVERAL DAYS AND NOW BACK ON. HAS SHE FULLY RECOVERED IN A\nPOLITICAL AND MEDIA SENSE FROM WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEKEND?\n>> I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION BECAUSE THERE IS A\nMUCH LARGER QUESTION ABOUT THE OVERALL COVERAGE OF THIS\nCAMPAIGN BY THE ELECTRONIC MEDIA, BY CABLE AND NETWORK\nNEWS. WE'VE BEEN TERRIFIC AT\nINTERPRETATION AT GIVING EXTRA TIME TO DEBATE PANELS.\nBUT WE'VE BEEN POSITIVELY AWFUL IN TERMS OF REPORTING IN A\nCOHERENT WAY THE STORY OF WILL THIS CAMPAIGN, THE REAL EXISTING\nLIFE AND RECORD OF DONALD TRUMP. THE NEW YORK TIMES, \"WASHINGTON\nPOST,\" THE \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" HAVE DONE FABULOUS REPORTING ON\nTHIS. AND WE GIVE SNIPPETS OF IT.\nWE NEED TO BE DOING AN HOUR, TWO HOURS A NIGHT OF REAL BIOGRAPHY,\nRUNNING IT OVER AND OVER OF WHAT TRUMP'S LIFE AND RECORD HAVE\nBEEN ABOUT BECAUSE THEY'RE AT ABSOLUTE ODDS WITH THE MYTHICAL\nAND LYING STORY THAT HAS TOLD US.\nHE'S A CON MAN. IT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED.\nAND ALSO HE HAS PRESIDED OVER A COVER UP OF HIS OWN LIFE.\nAND WE HAVE ALLOWED IT IN CABLE NEWS AND NETWORK NEWS\nPARTICULARLY. >> HERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT.\nAND I HAVE TO PUSH BACK A LITTLE BIT.\nI SEE COMMENTS LIKE YOURS EVERY DAY AND YET YOU COULD SAY IT'S\nALL COMING FROM LIBERALS WHO DON'T WANT TO SEE TRUMP E ELECT.\nISN'T THERE A VISCERAL HATE OF TRUMP BY THE JOURNALISTS AND\nISN'T THAT SEEPING THROUGH IN THE COVERAGE?\n>> I WOULDN'T CALL IT HATRED. I THINK THAT THERE IS\nREALIZATION AND IT'S NOT JUST LIBERALS, I THINK IT'S\nCONSERVATIVE, TOO, THERE IS REALIZATION THAT TRUMP IS A CON\nMAN. AND THAT THAT IS A BIG PART OF\nTHE STORY. LOOK, WE HAVE REPORTED AND\nNOBODY HAS BEEN TOUGHER ON HILLARY CLINTON ESPECIALLY ON\nTHE SERVER QUESTION THAN I, I'VE SAID IT'S INDEFENSIBLE WHAT SHE\nDID WITH IT, AND WE HAVE REPORTED ON HER WHOLE LIFE.\nSHE HAS BEEN AROUND FOR 25, 30 YEARS IN PUBLIC ON THE PUBLIC\nSTAGE. AND WE KNOW HER EVERY POSITION\nAND RECORD AND HER LIFE. TRUMP IS DIFFERENT.\nHE'S A NEW KID ON THE BLOCK IN TERMS OF BEING IN A PRESIDENTIAL\nCAMPAIGN. WE NEED TO DO WHAT THE\n\"WASHINGTON POST\" AND \"NEW YORK TIMES\" AND THE OTHER PRINT PRESS\nOR OLD FASHIONED MEDIA HAS DONE, WHICH IS TO REPORT THE REAL\nEXISTING RECORD REPEATEDLY. THAT IS THE STORY HERE.\nAND THAT IS WHERE THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS A REALLY GOOD BEEF\nAGAINST THE MEDIA. WE HAVEN'T -- IT'S NOT EQUAL.\nIT'S DISEQUAL THAT WE HAVE ALLOWED DONALD TRUMP TO PLAY US\nLIKE THIS AND WE FOCUS ON HIS OUTRAGEOUS STATEMENTS WHICH WE\nDO EVERY DAY AND WE GIVE EQUAL TIME TO THOSE ON HIS SIDE AND\nHILLARY'S SIDE DEBATING THESE CRAZY STATEMENTS AND POSITIONS\nTHAT HE CHANGES EVERY DAY. AND WE ANALYZE THAT, BUT DO WE\nGO BACK AND LOOK AT HIS WHOLE BUSINESS RECORD?\nNO. WE DON'T.\nHOW ABOUT A REAL INVESTIGATIVE BIOGRAPHY ON MSNBC, ON CNN THAT\nRUNS EVERY NIGHT ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON,\nABOUT THEIR TWO LIVES? PUT THEM SIDE BY SIDE AND RUN IT\nEVERY NIGHT UNTIL THE DEBATES. >> LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT WHAT\nNICK KRISTOF WROTE IN THE \"NEW YORK TIMES.\"\nI THINK HE WAS CHANNELING A LOT OF THE FRUSTRATIONS SOME FEEL.\nHE SAID WHERE HE SHOULD BE GUAR, NOT LAP DOGS.\nFOR MY PART, I'VE NEVER MET A NATIONAL POLL COITICIAN AS I WI\nINFORMED AND DECENT SIF AS TRUMP.\nHE'S NOT NORMAL. AND SOMEHOW THAT IS WHAT OUR\nBARKS NEED TO C CONVEY. HE'S AN OPINION JOURNALIST, BUT\nDO YOU THINK JOURNALISTS WHO TRY TO BE FAIR TO BOTH SIDES ARE\nFAILING BY NOT CALLING THIS STUFF OUT?\n>> I THINK AGAIN THE QUESTION OF DONALD TRUMP'S STABILITY,\nPREPARATION, KNOWLEDGE, IGNORANCE IF IT WERE THAT, IS A\nBIG PART OF THE STORY. WE'VE NEVER HAD A CANDIDATE\nBEFORE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT CERTAINLY IN THE MODERN AGE WHO\nTHERE ARE SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS STABILITY.\n>> HOLD ON. ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT HIS MENTAL\nSTABILITY? WHAT ARE YOU SAYING THERE?\n>> ABOUT HIS ABILITY TO DEAL WITH PROBLEMS IN A LEVEL-HEADED\nWAY, THE PROBLEMS OF THE KIND THAT THE PRESIDENCY THROWS AT\nSOMEONE. IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT RESPONDING.\nBUT AGAIN, LET'S LOOK AT HIS RECORD.\n>> BUT I CAN HEAR TRUMP SUPPORTERS YELLING AT THE TV\nRIGHT NOW SAYING THAT YOU AND I AND EVERYBODY ON CNN IS PART OF\nTHE PROBLEM. THAT'S WHY TRUMP ATTACKS CNN ON\nTWITTER ALL TIME. HE THINKS WE'RE RELENTLESSLY\nAGAINST HIM. >> FIRST OF ALL, LOOK AT HOW WE\nGAVE HIM ALL THE AIR TIME WE HAVE AND PARTICULARLY DURING THE\nPERIOD WHEN HE WAS SEEK THE NOMINATION.\nWE GAVE HIM MORE FREE AIR TIME THAN ANY CANDIDATE HAS RECEIVED\nIN HISTORY. WE DID NOT GIVE HILLARY CLINTON\nEQUAL AMOUNTS OF TIME. LOOK, I'M SAYING PUT THE TWO OF\nTHEM UP THERE NEXT TO EACH OTHER IN TERMS OF THEIR RECORD, THEIR\nLIVES. DO IT AS DOCUMENTARY FORM.\nAND THAT IS FAIR, IT IS, QUOTE, OBJECTIVE, IT'S WHAT WE NEED TO\nBE DOING BECAUSE HIS LIFE IS THE NEW REAL STORY AND HIS BUSINESS\nRECORD. >> CARL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR\nSHARING THESE THOUGHTS. PLEASE STICK AROUND.\nUP NEXT HERE THOUGH, WHY SO MANY AMERICANS THINK THAT WE ARE UP\nRELIABLE SOURCES. A NEW POLL SHOWS RECORD LOW\nLEVEL TRUST OF MEDIA AND GUESS WHO IS TAKING CREDIT FOR THAT.\nWE'LL TALK ABOUT WHAT REPORTERS CAN DO TO TURN IT AROUND.                \u00e2\u0099\u00aa\u00e2\u0099\u00aa",

AND YOU CAN SEE WHY HERE.\nONLY 14% OF REPUBLICANS SAYING THAT THEY TRUST THE NEWS XWLEED\nIN YEAR. THAT NUMBER IS A BIG DROP FROM\nLAST YEAR. A RECORD LOW OF ABOUT 30%.\nIT WON'T SURPRISE YOU TO HEAR THAT TRUMP IS TAKING CREDIT FOR\nTHAT DROP IN TRUST. SO I'LL BRING BACK OUR PANEL TO\nTALK MORE ABOUT THIS. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY TALK ABOUT\nWHAT JOURNALISTS, WHAT COMMENTATOR, WHAT WE CAN ALL DO\nTO GET THE NUMBER BACK UP. EVERY DAY WE CAN EITHER REGAIN\nPEOPLE'S TRUST OR LOSE EVEN MORE OF.\nBACK WITH ME, LYNN SWEDE, S.E.CUPP AND DAVE FARENHOLT WHO\nHAS BEENHEROIC WORK. SOME SAY IT'S POLL LIT ZER\nWORTHY. ESSENTIALLY WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN\nDOING IS GOING TO ALL THE CHARITIES AND ASKING THEM IF\nTHEY HAVE RECEIVED DONATIONS FROM TRUMP.\nWHY ARE YOU GOING TO THE CHARITIES AND NOT TRUMP\nDIRECTLY? >> ACTUALLY DID GO TO TRUMP IN\nTHE BEGINNING. WE WANTED TO -- TRUMP SAYS HE\nGIVES TENS OF MILLIONS TO CHARITY, SO WE ASKED PROVIDE\nPROOF. SHOW US HOW MUCH DID HE GIVE.\nAND HE WON'T GIVE US THAT PROOF. SO I SET OUT TO TRY TO PROVE HIM\nRIGHT AND I WANTED TO MAKE MY SEARCH AS OPEN AND AS\nTRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE. SO I MADE A LIST OF ALL THE\nCHARITIES I THOUGHT TRUMP SEEMED THE CLOSEST TO, ONES MOST LIKELY\nTO GET HIS MONEY. AND I STARTED CAUSING THOSE\nPEOPLE AND POSTING MY RESULTS ONLINE, ON TWITTER.\nAND THAT'S WHAT I'VE TRIED DO. BOTH BECAUSE I WANT TRUMP TO\nKNOW THAT I'M OUT THERE LOOKING TRYING TO PROVE HIM RIGHT AND\nALSO BECAUSE I WANT THE PUBLIC TO SEE WHAT I'M DOING AND IF\nTHEY HAVE IDEAS TO SEND THEM TO ME.\n>> SO YOU'VE BEEN WRITING STORY AFTER STORY.\nAND TELL ME THE BEHIND OF SCENES STORY BECAUSE I THINK IT MIGHT\nBE P ONE SMALL WAY VERSUS TRYING TO REGAIN PEOPLE'S TRUST.\nWHAT YOU'RE DOING IS SHOWING YOUR WORK.\nAND THE REACTION. TELL ME ABOUT THE REACTION\nYOU'VE GOTTEN FROM READERS. >> IT'S BEEN GREAT.\nAND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN REACHING OUT\nAND SAYING, HEY, HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THIS, HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT\nTHAT. FOR INSTANCE, THIS WEEK WE'RE\nLOOKING FOR PORTRAIT, 6-FOOT THE TALL PORTRAIT OF DONALD TRUMP\nTHAT HE BOUGHT HIMSELF BUT USED $20,000 OF HIS CHARITY'S MONEY\nTO PAY FOR. AND I NEED TO KNOW WHERE IT IS\nBECAUSE I NEED TO KNOW WHETHER ITS FOUND A CHAIRABLE THE USE\nFOR IT. AND THIS WEEK A READER ON\nTWITTER SPOTTED ANOTHER MESSAGE ON FACEBOOK THAT SENT IT ME THAT\nHELPED ME TRACK DOWN AN IMPORTANT CLUE WHERE IT WENT.\n>> AND LYNN, DO YOU THINK I'M BEING TOO OPTIMISTIC OR IS IT\nPOSSIBLE THAT BY DOING THIS KIKIND\nEVER INVESTIGATING THAT WE CAN START TO WIN BACK SOME OF THE\nPEOPLE WHO SAY WE DON'T TRUST THE MEDIA TODAY?\n>> I DON'T KNOW, BUT WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT WE CAN'T STOP DOING\nTHE WORK JUST BECAUSE WE'RE AT THIS ALL-TIME LOW.\nI MEAN, THIS IS WHAT GALLUP CALLED A STUNNING DEVELOPMENT\nFOR AN INSTITUTION DESIGNEDED TO  I WAS AT A FOCUS GROUP AND I\nASKED TO DO YOU BELIEVE IN FACT CHECKS THAT THE MEDIA PROVIDES.\nAND THEY SAID, AND THIS IS PART OF WHAT WE'RE GRAPPLING WITH,\nWELL, WE DON'T TRUST THE MEDIA, SO WHY WOULD WE TRUST WHAT THEY\nCONCLUDE. THAT SHOWS HOW HIGH THE BAR IS\nNOW. AND DAVID, I COMMEND YOU BECAUSE\nYOU'RE PUTTING OUT THINGS THAT WE MIGHT ALL AGREE ARE FACT.\nWE HAVE TO RESPECT THAT PEOPLE DON'T SEE THINGS THE WAY WE\nMIGHT. AND JUST KEEP WORKING IN OUR\nCRAFT TO MAKE OUR CASE WHEN WE HAVE IT AND THIS IS TRUE OF A\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DOWN TO AN ALDER MAN TO MAKE IT AS\nSIMPLE AS AS AIR TIGHT AS POSSIBLE AND UNDERSTANDABLE TO\nPEOPLE WITH EVIDENCE WHICH WE CAN LINK TO NOW THAT WE HAVE ALL\nKINDS OF SOCIAL MEDIA. SO I THINK THE POLL -- YEAH,\nIT'S BAD FOR YOU BUT IT SHOULDN'T STOP US FROM THE GUM\nCHU HAS GONE REPORT ERTZERS ALW DO.\nWE HAVE 50 DAYS LEFT SO WE SHOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT OUR OWN\nPOLL NUMBERS. >> DONALD TRUMP NOTICED THE\nNUMBERS AND HE SAID HE BELIEVES HE IS PARTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR\nTHAT DECLINE IN TRUST PARTICULARLY AMONG REPUBLICANS.\nLET ME ASK YOU, S.E., IS IT DANGEROUS FOR DONALD TRUMP TO BE\nHELPING UNDERMINE AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS EVEN ONES LIKE THE\nMEDIA THAT WEREN'T VERY POPULAR TO BEGIN WITH?\n>> OF COURSE IT IS. AND THERE IS ALWAYS SOME\nCONSTERNATION OVER THE MEDIA. EVERY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.\nUSUALLY IT'S REPUBLICANS GRIPING ABOUT DEMOCRATIC BIAS IN THE\nMEDIA, LIBERAL BIAS, BUT THERE IS ALWAYS SOME.\nNEVER BEFORE HAVE WE SEEN A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT NOT ONLY\nTELLING PEOPLE TO BE SKREPTICAL BUT TO HIT US AS A BODY.\nTHERE IS NO NUANCE FOR THE ROLE OF JOURNALISM.\nTRUMP FUNDAMENTALLY SHOWS OVER AND OVER AGAIN HE DOESN'T\nUNDERSTAND. >> YOU DON'T THINK HE\nUNDERSTANDS OR DO YOU THINK IT IS ALL AN ACT?\nBECAUSE THE ONE TIME I SAW HIM IN YEAR, HE IS SO KIND, SO\nFRIENDLY, SO CHARMING. YOU DON'T THINK HE'S JUST DOING\nIT FOR SHOW? >> NO, HE'S A CHARMING GUY, BUT,\nNO, WE'VE SEEN TOO MANY REVEALS. HE GAVE SOME CHARITABLE AMOUNT I\nTHINK TO THE VETS THAT ONE TIMET THE COVERAGE HE WANTED.\nHE SAID THE MEDIA SHOULD BE CONGRATULATING ME.\nAND THIS IS JUST NOT FUNDAMENTALLY THE JOB OF THE\nMEDIA.

WE BETTER GET VERY TOUGH, FOLKS.\nVERY TOUGH. >> CLINTON ON THE OTHER HAND,\nMORE MEASURED. SHE TOLD REPORTERS WHEN SHE WAS\nIN TOUCH -- THAT SHE WAS IN TOUCH WITH OFFICIALS FROM NEW\nYORK. THEN SHE SAID THIS ON HER PLANE\nLAST NIGHT. >> I THINK IT'S ALWAYS WISER TO\nWAIT UNTIL YOU HAVE INFORMATION BEFORE MAKING CONCLUSIONS.\nBECAUSE WE ARE JUST IN THE BEGINNING STAGES OF TRYING TO\nDETERMINE WHAT HAPPENED. >> WHAT DO THESE TWO\nDRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT RESPONSES TO THE SAME EVENT TELL US?\nABOUT HOW TRUMP OR CLINTON MAY LEAD OUR NATION, ESPECIALLY\nAFTER A MOTION LIKE THIS, IN FOUR SHORT MONTHS.\nONE WILL BE DOING JUST THAT. HERE TO DISCUSS, WE HAVE OUR\nWASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT FOR THE NEW YORKER.\nAND THE SENIOR EDITOR OF THE \"ATLANTIC.\"\nRON, I THINK WE GOT THE RESPONSES THAT THE PUBLIC WOULD\nEXPECT FROM DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON.\nYES, THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT. WHICH ONE THOUGH DO YOU BELIEVE\nIS THE MOST INDICATIVE OF HOW THEY WOULD ACTUALLY ACT AS A\nCOMMANDER IN CHIEF? THERE IS ONE THING, THE\nRHETORIC, AND WHAT YOU SAY AHEAD OF AN ELECTION TO GET VOTES, AND\nONE THING ABOUT HOW YOU'D ACT IN THE OVAL OFFICE.\n>> I THINK THEY WERE BOTH VERY REVEALING.\nI THINK YOU SAW AN INCREDIBLE DISTILLATION OF MUCH OF THE\nCHOICE IN THE ELECTION IN THE 40 SECONDS OF CONTRASTING VIDEO.\nTRUMP'S GREATEST STRENGTH IS THAT MANY VOTERS VIEW HIM AS\nLIKELY TO BRING CHANGE. HE SAYS WHAT HE MEANS.\nHE WILL BE SOMETHING DIFFERENT. HE WILL NOT BE A TYPICAL\nPOLITICIAN. HE WILL KIND OF GO OUT AND SAY\nWHAT HE BELIEVES AND, NOT INCIDENTALLY, GIVEN HIS\nCOALITION, THAT HE'LL CRACK DOWN ON ALL THE FOREIGN FORCES AND\nINFLUENCES THAT THEY BELIEVE ARE UNDERMINING MANY OF THE VARITIES\nOF AMERICAN LIFE. ON THE OTHER HAND, WHAT YOU SAW\nFROM CLINTON IS HER COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE IN THIS RACE.\nSHE IS A MORE SOBER, YOU KNOW, KIND OF DELIBERATE LEADER, AND\nVOTERS OVERWHELM DINGLY SEE THA. VOTERS SEE TRUMP LIKELY TO BRING\nCHANGE. OTHERS SAY CLINTON IS QUALIFIED\nTO BE PRESIDENT AND COMMANDER IN CHIEF, AND MORE QUALIFIED TO\nHANDLE FOREIGN POLICY. YOU GOT A VERY GOOD SUMMARY OF\nTHE CONTRASTING STYLES AND ARGUMENTS THAT THEY'RE BRINGING\nTO THE VOTERS NOW AND WOULD N LIKELIHOOD, BRING TO THE OVAL\nOFFICE IF ELECTED. >> RYAN, THE ARGUMENT IS OVER.\nDID TRUMP SPEAK TOO SOON BEFORE AUTHORITIES SAID SOMETHING.\nTHE POINT IS HE WAS CORRECT. THIS WOULD BE A DIFFERENT\nSITUATION IF IT WAS NOT A BOMBING.\nASIDE FROM THAT, LISTEN TO WHAT HIS RUNNING MATE, MIKE PENCE,\nSAID ABOUT THE BOMBINGS IN NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY AND THE\nSTABBING IN MINNESOTA TODAY. LISTEN.\n>> AS A GOVERNOR AND A CANDIDATE FOR NATIONAL OFFICE, IT WOULD\nNOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR ME TO COMMENT ON AN ONGOING\nINVESTIGATION, OTHER TO SAY THEY ARE THANKFUL IN OUR HEARTS THAT\nTHERE IS NO LOSS OF LIFE AS A RESULT OF THESE HORRIFIC\nATTACKS. >> SO HE SAYS IT WOULDN'T BE\nAPPROPRIATE FOR HIM TO COMMENT. THAT IS DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT\nTHAN WHAT HIS RUNNING MATE SAID. WHO HANDLED IT IN A WAY THAT IS\nMORE EFFECTIVE IN TERMS OF GARNERING THE VOTES AND THE\nSUPPORT OF THE UNDECIDES THEY NEED?\n>> YOU GET THE SENSE THAT TRUMP AND PENCE ARE NOT ON THE PHONE\nCOORDINATING THEIR RESPONSE TO THIS.\nTHEY ARE SORT OF RUNNING SEPARATE CAMPAIGNS IN A SENSE.\nTHEIR RESPONSES WERE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.\nPENCE'S WAS MORE LIKE CLINTON, WHICH IS WHAT MOST POLITICAL\nLEADERS DO IN A BREAKING NEWS SITUATION.\nFRANKLY, MOST JOURNALISTS, COMMENTATO\nCOMMENTATORS, ANYONE IN THE PUBLIC EYE, WHEN A MAJOR,\nBREAKING NEWS EVENT, WHERE NONE OF US ACTUALLY HAVE THE FACTS,\nYOU TEND TO BE CAREFUL. IF YOU ARE A POLITICAL LEADER,\nIT'S EVEN MORE IMPORTANT TO DO THAT BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO\nSAY SOMETHING THAT GET S AHEAD F THE FACTS.\nPENCE AND CLINTON, LONG-TIME POLITICIANS BOTH KNOW THAT'S THE\nWAY TO OPERATION. TRUMP, YEAH, I PERSONALLY GOT\nTHE SENSE FROM TRUMP THAT -- EVERY TIME THERE HAS BEEN AN\nINCIDENT LIKE THIS, SOME KIND OF TERRORIST ATTACK, HE JUMPS ON IT\nVERY QUICKLY AND HE WANTS TO BE OUT THERE SPEAKING ABOUT IT.\nWHETHER HE KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED OR NOT.\nAT THE TIME HE SPOKE LAST NIGHT, IT WAS NOT KNOWN WHETHER THIS\nWAS TRULY A BOMB. SO HE WAS GETTING AHEAD OF\nHIMSELF. I THINK IF YOU WERE PRESIDENT,\nYOU'D HOPE THAT HE WOULD HAVE PEOPLE AROUND HIM THAT WOULD\nSORT OF CONTAIN THAT UM -- IMPULSE TO SPEAK BEFORE THE\nFACTS ARE THERE. >> WE DIDN'T KNOW.\nTHE MEDIA, THE PUBLIC. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TRUMP OR\nCLINTON OR PRESIDENT OBAMA KNEW. HE SAID, RON, WE BETTER GET\nTOUGH, FOLKS. WE KEPT SAYING, WE'RE GOING TO\nGET TOUGH AND SMART AND VIGILANT.\nHE USED THAT AS AN OPPORTUNITY, WITHOUT, YOU KNOW, CERTAINLY AT\nLEAST KNOWING WHO WAS BEHIND THE ATTACKS BECAUSE THAT'S STILL NOT\nPUBLIC, THAT THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION'S POLICIES AREN'T\nWORKING. THAT'S WHAT HE WAS SAYING.\n>> RIGHT. TWO BIG POINTS, I THINK, ARE\nIMPORTANT HERE. ONE, YOU KNOW, THESE KIND OF\nATTACKS, UNFORTUNATELY, HAVE BECOME A DRUM BEAT IN AMERICAN\nLIFE. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THE\nAMERICAN PUBLIC IS BEING KNOCKED TRULY OFF BALANCE BY THEM.\nPEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT TERROR.\nTHEY SEE A SENSE FOR VIGILANCE. BUT OPINIONS ARE NOT RADICALLY\nSHIFTING AS A RESULT OF THIS. TRUMP GOT A BOOST LAST FALL IN\nTHE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY AROUND THE PARIS AND SAN BERNARDINO\nATTACKS. IN THE GENERAL ELECTION\nATTITUDES, LIKE BANNING MUSLIM IMMIGRATION, IT HAS NOT\nRADICALLY CHANGED MONTH BY MONTH ON THIS.\nTHE SECOND POINT, IT IS STRIKING TRUMP MADE THE COMMENTS YOU\nSITED ON THE SAME DAY THAT ROBERT GATES, THE CIA DIRECTOR,\nDEFENSE SECRETARY FOR GEORGE W. BUSH AND BARACK OBAMA, JOINED A\nLIST OF 50 OTHER SECURITY OFFICIALS IN SAYING HE VIEWED\nTRUMP AS UNFIT AND UNQUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT.\nTHE SAME KIND OF SHOOT FROM THE HIP, YOU KNOW, THAT WE SAW\nYESTERDAY THAT DOES APPEAL TO A SEGMENT OF THE ELECELECTORATE,\nBELIEVES THEY'VE BEEN FAILED. EVEN GOLDWATER IN 1964 DID NOT\nFACE AS MUCH DEFECTION FROM REPUBLICAN NATIONAL SECURITY\nLEADERS AS TRUMP HAS FROM THE LONG TIME OF FORMER CABINET\nOFFICIALS AND OTHERS WHO DO NOT BELIEVE HE'S QUALIFIED TO BE\nPRESIDENT. >> THIS IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF\nRESPONSE TO AN INCIDENT THAT PEOPLE LIKE GATES AND THE SORT\nOF NATIONAL SECURITY ESTABLISHMENT OF THE REPUBLICAN\nPARTY WOULD POINT TO AS, WAIT A SECOND, THIS IS NOT HOW YOU\nOPERATE WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS -- WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS\nGOES DOWN. >> BUT AS WE SAW THOUGH ON THIS\nSHOW YESTERDAY, HE DOES HAVE THE SUPPORT OF FORMER CIA DIRECTOR\nWHO SERVED UNDER PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON.\nTHAT IS ONE NAME IN DEFENSE HE DOES HAVE.\nTHANK YOU. I HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE.\nTHANK YOU VERY MUCH.",

HILLARY CLINTON AND HER CAMPAIGN\nOF 2008 STARTED THE BIRTHER CONTROVERSY.\nI FINISHED IT. I FINISHED IT.\nYOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA WAS BORN\nIN THE UNITED STATES, PERIOD. >> AND HE WALKED OFF WITHOUT\nTAKING QUESTIONS. JOINING ME NOW, KELLY RIDDELL.\nAND JOE TRIPPY, THE DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST AND FOX NEWS\nCONTRIBUTOR. ERIN, JOURNALISTS WERE REALLY\nANGRY, SOME OF THEM WERE STANDING ON CHAIRS AND SHOUTING\nQUESTIONS AT TRUMP AS HE WALKED AWAY.\nDID TRUMP DO A BAIT AND SWITCH TO DRAW THAT ALMOST NONSTOP\nCABLE COVERAGE FOR WHAT WE THOUGHT WERE MAJOR REMARKS ON\nTHE BIRTHER ISSUE? >> HE SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID HE WAS\nGOING TO TAKE QUESTIONS AND THEN NOT TAKE QUESTIONS.\n>> I'M NOT SURE HE WAS SAYING THAT.\n>> CNN LOOKED ESPECIALLY WHINEY BECAUSE ALL THEIR ANCHORS WERE\nSAYING WE WERE DUPED. FOR AT LEAST A YEAR THE NETWORKS\nHAVE BEEN TAKING TRUMP'S EVENTS LIVE.\nTHEY COULD HAVE DECIDED TO GO INTO THE EVENT WHEN DONALD TRUMP\nSTARTED SPEAKING ABOUT THE BIRTHER COMMENTS.\nTHEY DIDN'T HAVE TO TAKE THE WHOLE EVENT LIVE.\nTHE OTHER THING I WOULD POINT OUT, DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN\nSMEARED THROUGH THE PRESS FOR BEING THE KING OF TAX BREAKS FOR\nALL KIND OF OTHER PROBLEMS HE'S HAD WITH HIS HOTEL CHAINS.\nHERE HE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY WITH TWO MONTHS LEFT TO GO BEFORE\nELECTION DAY TO REMIND EVERYTHING OF THE SUCCESS HE'S\nHAD. WHY PEOPLE LIKE HIM IN THE FIRST\nPLACE. I THOUGHT IT WAS A SMART PUBLIC\nRELATIONS MOVE ON HIS POINT. >> NOBODY FORCED THE CABLE\nNETWORKS TO STAY WITH THAT EVENT UNTIL HE GOT TO THE MAIN TOPIC,\nBUT WAS DONALD TRUMP, IN EFFECT, FORCED, PRESSURED TO DO THIS BY\nTHE MEDIA BECAUSE HIS TOP SURROGATES, RUDY GIULIANI AND\nKELLYANNE CONWAY WENT ON AND SAID WE BELIEVE OBAMA WAS BORN\nIN THE UNITED STATES, THEN PEOPLE ASKED WHY ISN'T HE\nSAYING? >> HE TWEETED EARLIER DON'T\nBELIEVE ANYONE YOU HEAR OTHER THAN ME, I'M THE OFFICIAL WORD\nON EVERYTHING, SO, YES, I THINK HE HAD TO COME OUT AND PUT THIS\nISSUE TO REST, BECAUSE IT WAS PERCOLATING IN THE PRESS AND NOW\nHE CAN SAY I BELIEVE OBAMA IS A U.S. CITIZEN AND THAT'S\nIMPORTANT IN HIS REHABILITATION EFFORT.\nI WOULD SAY WHAT I FOUND VERY APPALLING ABOUT THE MEDIA\nCOVERAGE AT THIS WAS THE DEBATE OF DONALD TRUMP IS HE CORRECTED\nONE FALSEHOOD, BUT THEN GAVE TWO OTHERS.\nNOW, THERE IS INDISPUTABLE, FACT CHECKERS HAVE SAID HILLARY\nCLINTON DIDN'T START THE 2007 BIRTHER RUMOR, BUT SHE, IN FACT,\nDID. STARTED WITH A MARK PENN MEMO IN\n2007. >> SHE DIDN'T PERSONALLY.\n>> HER CAMPAIGN DID. HE SAID SHE AND HER CAMPAIGN.\nTHEN HER CAMPAIGN MANAGER WENT ON CNN ON FRIDAY, YEAH, WE HAD A\nSTAFFER WHO SENT A BIRTHER E-MAIL OUT AND WE FIRED THEM.\nTHAT CAME FROM THE CAMPAIGN. >> LET ME GET YOU IN ON THIS,\nTHE STAFFER WAS A VOLUNTEER THAT WAS FIRED, INTERNAL MEMO, DIDN'T\nTALK ABOUT OBAMA'S CITIZENSHIP, BUT TALKED ABOUT PAINTING HIM AS\nAN OTHER AND A REPORTER NOW SAYS BLUMENTHAL ACTUALLY TOLD THIS\nREPORTER THAT OBAMA MIGHT HAVE BEEN BORN ELSEWHERE,\nBLUMENTHALEN DENIES THAT. IS THE PRESS HOLDING TRUMP\nACCOUNTABLE FOR MAKING THIS CHARGE AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON\nHIMSELF IN THE SAME TWO SENTENCES WHERE HE'S SAYING I\nACCEPT OBAMA IS AMERICAN? >> YEAH, THEY ARE.\nLET'S GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL THING, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE\nMANIPULATING THE MEDIA TO GET COVERAGE, I'M SHOCKED ABOUT\nTHAT. SO I AGREE ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THAT\nTHEY'VE GOT DUPED INTO IT, BUT THEN THEY WENT WITH IT AND\nSTAYED WITH IT. ON THIS ISSUE, THOUGH, LOOK,\nTHERE WERE VOLUNTEERS IN THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN SPREAD\nSOMETHING OR SOMEBODY NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.\nTHIS IS A GUY WHO RAN FOR PRESIDENT, IS RUNNING FOR\nPRESIDENT, AND THE REASON HE GOT THE NOMINATION, BIG PIECE OF IT,\nWAS HIM PLAYING TO THE BIRTHER MOVEMENT AND THE COVERAGE HE GOT\nABOUT THAT. SO TO SHOW UP FIVE YEARS LATER\nAND JUST SORT OF, LIKE, HEY, I FINISHED IT, IT'S OVER --\n>> WE'LL GET INTO THIS MORE LATER IN THE PROGRAM, BUT THERE\nALSO SEEMS TO BE A THEME IN THE MEDIA THAT HE DIDN'T APOLOGIZE,\nHE NEEDED TO APOLOGIZE BECAUSE HE DID PUSH THIS BEGINNING FIVE\nYEARS AGO. FAIR OR UNFAIR?\n>> HAS HE EVER APOLOGIZED FOR ANYTHING?\nOF COURSE HE WASN'T GOING TO APOLOGIZE.\n>> THAT'S NOT HIS STYLE. >> STOP COMPLAINING ABOUT IT.\n>> WHAT DID YOU THINK IN MY INTERVIEW WITH HIM AS HE TALKED\nABOUT THE DISGUSTINGLY DISHONEST MEDIA THAT HE IS SAYING IN\nADVANCE, THE DEBATE MOD RATE TORS WILL ALL BE UNFAIR,\nPREEMPTIVE STRIKE? >> I THINK THAT STARTED EARLIER\nWITH THE MATT LAUER INTERVIEW WHEN HILLARY CLINTON STARTED\nFUNDRAISING OFF OF THE FACT THAT MATT LAUER WAS SO UNFAIR TO HER\nIN THAT, AND ALL OF HER SURROGATES WENT ON TV AND SAID\nMATT LAUER DID NOT HIT DONALD TRUMP LIKE HE NEEDED TO, DIDN'T\nFACT CHECK ON THE SPOT, AND THAT WAS CIG FALLING TO LESTER HOLT,\nTO CHRIS WALLACE, TO THE MODERATORS, YOU BETTER, YOU\nBETTER GO AFTER DONALD TRUMP AND YOU BETTER, PERHAPS, LAY OFF\nHILLARY CLINTON OR WE'RE GOING TO QUESTION YOUR CREDIBILITY.\n>> THAT ASSUMES THESE ARE NOT JOURNALISTS THAT CAN WITHSTAND\nPRESSURE AND I WILL WITHHOLD JUDGMENT UNTIL WE SEE THESE\nDEBATES.

A REPORTER ASKED CLINTON ABOUT\nHOW THAT WAS MISHANDLED AND ABOUT HER DEFENSIVENESS WITH THE\nPRESS. >> CAN YOU BE A LITTLE BIT MORE\nSPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO AND DID VOTERS GET\nA SENSE OF SOME OF THAT IN THE WAY YOUR CAMPAIGN HANDLED THE\nEVENTS OF YOUR ILLNESS OVER THE WEEKEND?\n>> YOU KNOW, MY CAMPAIGN SAID THEY COULD HAVE BEEN FASTER, AND\nI AGREE WITH THAT, BUT I HAVE TO SAY, FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, I\nTHOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE FINE, AND I THOUGHT THAT THERE WASN'T\nREALLY ANY REASON TO MAKE A BIG FUSS ABOUT IT.\n>> BOTH CANDIDATES PUTTING OUT BRIEF LETTERS FROM THEIR\nPHYSICIANS, TRUMP RELEASED HIS WITH DR. OZ.\n>> HOW DO YOU STAY HEALTHY ON A CAMPAIGN TRAIL?\n>> WELL, IT'S A LOT OF WORK, YOU KNOW, WHEN I'M SPEAKING IN FRONT\nOF 15,000 AND 20,000 PEOPLE AND UP THERE USING A LOT OF MOTION,\nI GUESS IN ITS OWN WAY IT'S PRETTY HEALTHY ACT.\n>> TRUE IF YOU'RE AN ANCHOR, TOO.\nKELLY RIDDELL, IS THE MEDIA OVERPLAYING THE HILLARY CLINTON\nPNEUMONIA STORY, OR DID CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN KIND OF TURN\nTHIS INTO A CRISIS THROUGH HOW THEY DEALT WITH THE MEDIA?\n>> THEY TURNED IT INTO A CRISIS WITH HOW THEY DEALT WITH THE\nMEDIA, FOR SURE. IF SHE HAD PNEUMONIA DIAGNOSED\nON FRIDAY, AS SOON AS SHE HAD TO LEAVE THAT CEREMONY EARLY AND\nDODGE HER PRESS POOL, THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED,\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS PNEUMONIA AND IS NOT FEELING WELL, SHE'S\nGOT TO STEP OUT. EVERYONE WOULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD,\nTHE STORY WOULD HAVE BEEN OVER, BUT NO, SHE HAD TO WAIT EIGHT\nHOURS LATER IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT ANNOUNCEMENT AND THAT JUST\nRAISES SUSPICIONS. >> SOME CLINTON DEFENDERS ARE\nSAYING THIS IS SEXIST, A WOMAN BEING PORTRAYED AS FRAIL, CAN'T\nA GIRL HAVE A SICK DAY, SHE ASKS, AS IF THE ONLY QUESTION\nWAS ABOUT HER GETTING SICK AS OPPOSED TO NOT RELEASING THE\nINFORMATION ABOUT THE EARLIER DIAGNOSE OF PNEUMONIA.\n>> THAT'S ALL TRUE, ALL OF IT. I AGREE WITH KELLY.\nTHE THING HERE IS, LOOK, FROM BEING IN A PRESIDENTIAL\nCAMPAIGN, I'VE NEVER BEEN IN ONE WHERE PNEUMONIA OR SOMETHING\nLIKE IT DIDN'T SWEEP THROUGH THE PLANE.\n>> CANDIDATES GET SICK, STAFFERS GET SICK.\n>> NO ONE, NOT ONE OF THEM, WOULD HAVE BEEN ANNOUNCED IT\nBEFORE THE CANDIDATE WENT DOWN. I MEAN, THAT WOULD NOT HAVE\nHAPPENED. THE WHOLE THING WITHIN THE\nCAMPAIGN IS KEEP PUSHING FORWARD, BUT ONCE SHE HAD TO\nLEAVE THAT EVENT EARLY, THAT CAMPAIGN, IF IT WANTED TO AVOID\nANY OF THIS, HAD TO IMMEDIATELY GO OUT AND SAY SHE HAD BEEN\nDIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA. >> RARE MOMENT OF CONVERGENCE,\nAGREEMENT BETWEEN THESE TWO. ERIN McPIKE, WHAT ABOUT THE\nCONTRAST WITH DONALD TRUMP WHO DID HIS THING WITH A RATHER\nFRIENDLY DR. OZ, DO YOU THINK THAT GENERATED MORE POSITIVE OR\nNEGATIVE COVERAGE FOR HIM DOING IT IN THAT FORUM?\n>> ALTHOUGH THE PRESS RIDICULED IT, CONSIDER THE ALTERNATIVE, IN\nMAY OF 2008 WHEN JOHN McCAIN WAS 71 YEARS OLD, HE ALLOWED A\nSELECT SMALL GROUP OF REPORTERS INTO A COLD, DARKROOM FOR THREE\nHOURS TO VIEW THOUSANDS OF PAGES OF MEDICAL RECORDS AND WHAT HE\nGOT WAS A COUPLE OF STORIES, LENGTHY STORIES, ABOUT SOME OF\nTHE HEALTH ISSUES HE'S HAD, BUT HE'S HEALTHY, BORING.\nDONALD TRUMP TAKING A PAGE FROM BARACK OBAMA, WHO'S GONE ON LATE\nNIGHT TELEVISION TO SLOW JAM THE NEWS ON POLICY, REALIZES HE\nCOULD GET POSITIVE PRESS WITH SUPPORTERS FOR THIS.\nI THINK FOR HIM IT WAS A GOOD MOVE.\n>> INTERESTING, KELLY, I THINK THE PRESS CORPS WAS PRETTY TOUGH\nON HILLARY CLINTON OVER THIS WHOLE PNEUMONIA INCIDENT, IN\nPART BECAUSE I THINK THE PRESS FELT MISLED AND AS YOU SAID, THE\nPRESS POOL WAS THERE. IN \"THE NEW YORK TIMES,\" PRIVACY\nBACKFIRED, HER TENDENCY TO HUNKER DOWN THREATENS TO MAKE\nHER LOOK AGAIN AS IF SHE HAD SOMETHING TO HIDE.\nWHEN IT COMES TO THE COMMENT SHE LATER REGRETTED SAYING HALF OF\nTRUMP'S SUPPORTERS ARE DEPLORABLES, ET CETERA, THE\nTIMES PUTS TOGETHER TWO PARAGRAPHS AT THE END OF A\nSTORY. WHAT ABOUT THAT CONTRAST?\n>> I MEAN, IT'S JUST BIAS. DONALD TRUMP IS RIGHT WHEN HE\nSAYS THERE'S A CERTAIN LEVEL OF BIAS.\nSHE AND HER DEPLORABLES STATEMENT DIDN'T GET NEARLY AS\nMUCH COVERAGE AS ROMNEY'S 47% COVERAGE DID.\nTHAT LASTED WEEKS ON END. WE'VE ALL HEARD THE END OF THE\nDEPLORABLES COMMENT. YOU HEARD IN AN INTERVIEW WITH\nMIKE PENCE AND DONALD TRUMP EARLIER TODAY WAS CRITICIZED FOR\nNOT USING THE WORD DEPLORABLE AGAINST DAVID DUKE AND THE\nCAMPAIGN HAS REPEATEDLY DENOUNCED DAVID DUKE AND DAVID\nDUKE IS A RACIST, HE'S NOT  >> HE COULD BE BOTH.\n>> HE COULD BE BOTH. >> LET ME GET JOE IN, BECAUSE\nSOME IN THE MEDIA REACTED AND I WANT TO PLAY A LITTLE SOUND\nHERE, BY KIND OF DEFENDING THE POINT HILLARY CLINTON WAS MAKING\nABOUT TRUMP SUPPORTERS. LET'S ROLL THAT.\n>> DID SHE ACTUALLY NEED TO APOLOGIZE FOR THAT?\nWHEN YOU THINK ABOUT MANY OF THE ARCHITECTS BEHIND THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN WHO COME FROM THE ALT-RIGHT UNIVERSE, ONE COULD\nSAY HER DEPLORABLE. >> AS A MATTER OF STATISTICS,\nIT'S PROBABLY TRUE PEOPLE EXPRESSING RACIST SENTIMENT\nCONSTITUTE MORE THAN HALF OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS.\n>> SO WE'RE HEARING A LOT OF, YEAH, HILLARY CLINTON WAS RIGHT,\nBY PEOPLE IN THE PRESS WHO THINK HALF OR MORE OF DONALD TRUMP\nSUPPORTERS ARE TERRIBLE PEOPLE. >> I DON'T THINK -- WHO KNOWS\nHOW MANY ARE. THAT'S WHAT GOT HER IN THE WHOLE\nTROUBLE IN THE FIRST PLACE. >> YOU'VE BEEN IN CAMPAIGNS, IS\nIT SMART TO ATTACK THE OPPONENT'S VOTERS WHEN THOSE\nVOTERS MAY BE TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS?\n>> IT'S NOT, BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SLAMMED THE DOOR ON\nTHAT WAS TRUMP'S BIRTHER COMMENTS.\nHE HAD HER SORT OF TRYING TO EXPLAIN AWAY THE DEPLORABLE\nTHING, WHICH PUT THE QUESTION OF RACE AND BIGOTRY AND STUFF OUT\nTHERE, AND THEN HE COMES IN AND BY TRYING TO SLAM THE DOOR ON\nBIRTHERS, SORT OF REIGNITED A BIT.\n>> THAT WAS INTERESTING. >> THE COVERAGE, I THINK, HE\nTURNED THE COVERAGE WAS GOING AGAINST HER AND TURNED IT ON\nHIMSELF. >> HERE'S THE THING, WHEN I\nINTERVIEWED DONALD TRUMP, HE'S ON THE THREE-WEEK STRETCH OF\nBEING MORE SCRIPTED AND RESTRAINED, THEN WE HAD THE\nBIRTHER EVENT AND ALSO DONALD TRUMP SAYING THIS ABOUT HILLARY\nCLINTON AND HER BODY GUARDS. >> I THINK THAT HER BODY GUARDS\nSHOULD DROP ALL WEAPONS. THEY SHOULD DISARM.\nI THINK THEY SHOULD DISARM. IMMEDIATELY.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK, YES? YES.\nYEAH. TAKE THEIR GUNS AWAY.\nSHE DOESN'T WANT GUNS. TAKE THEM.\nLET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO HER. >> SO, GUN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS ALSO\nMAKE THE POINT THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE OPPOSED TO GUN RIGHTS, THEY\nHAVE SECURITY, IT'S KIND OF A TALKING POINT.\nTHE PRESS IS PLAYING THIS AS AN OUTRAGEOUS STATEMENT.\nCERTAINLY UNUSUAL FOR A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE TO SAY\nABOUT HIS OPPONENT. >> IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE PRESS\nTO COVER IT BECAUSE EVERYTHING A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SAYS IS\nIMPORTANT AND SPEAKS TO THEIR TEMPERAMENT.\n\"THE WASHINGTON POST,\" ERIN BLAKE THE REPORTER, ACTUALLY\nUNPACKED THE COMMENT HE MADE AND SAID HE'S MADE THE COMMENT MANY\nTIMES BEFORE AND IS JUST GIVING HIS SENTIMENT ON THE SECOND\nAMENDMENT. >> \"NEW YORK TIMES\" SAYS TRUMP\nRAISED THE SPECTRUM OF VIOLENCE AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON.\n>> I THINK THIS ONE IS REALLY DANGEROUS TERRITORY FOR HIM AND\nTHE PRESS TO GO DOWN, NOT BECAUSE OF WHAT HE SAID, BUT\nBECAUSE OF SOMEBODY OUT THERE WHO MIGHT HEAR IT AND ACT ON IT\nAND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES AND THE PRESS, I THINK, HAVING BEEN\nIN ALL THESE CAMPAIGNS WHERE THESE THREATS ARE REAL, YOU HAVE\nTO BE CAREFUL ABOUT IT. >> I JUST THINK THAT WE SHOULD\nBE DEBATING THE GUN POLICY. SECOND AMENDMENT POLICY BETWEEN\nHILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP.\nTHERE'S A DISTINCT DIFFERENCE. LET'S FOCUS ON THE POLICY.\nTHIS IS A GOOD WAY TO BRING THAT ISSUE FORWARD AND WE'RE NOT\nTALKING ABOUT IT. >> CAN I SAY ONE THING ABOUT THE\nDEPLORABLES COMMENT, THE DIFFERENCE WITH MITT ROMNEY IS\nMITT ROMNEY TRIED TO EXPLAIN HIS COMMENT ON 47% AWAY FOR WEEKS\nAND DIDN'T APOLOGIZE RIGHT AWAY, WHEREAS HILLARY CLINTON, THE\nREASON I THINK THE COVERAGE WENT AWAY --\n>> SHE APOLOGIZED FOR SAYING HALF.\n>> I'VE GOT TO MOVE ON. INTERESTINGLY, TRUMP IS LIKING\nCOMMENTS MORE ENDOWED, NOW CALLING HER CRAZY, WHACKY, AND\nNEUROTIC DOPE. SHE'S, I THINK, OFF THE\nCHRISTMAS CARD LIST.",

THE FACT DONALD TRUMP HAD A\nSTRONGER RESPONSE THAN HILLARY CLINTON IN THE SITUATION, AND BY\nTHE WAY SHE ALSO LABELED THE ATTACK AS A BOMBING, HER\nATTEMPTS TO REVERSE THAT NOW LOOK COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY\nPOLITICALLY STUPID. >> EVEN THE GOVERNOR OF NEW\nYORK, DEMOCRAT HIMSELF, CALLING IT TERRORISM, OBVIOUSLY TERROR,\nSAYING WE WON'T LET THEM WIN AND SCARE US, DIFFERENT, MUCH MORE\nFORCEFUL RESPONSE THAN HILLARY CLINTON HAD LAST NIGHT.\nWE'LL SEE IF HILLARY CLINTON COMES OUT WITH SOMETHING ON\nTWITTER OR SOMEWHERE ELSE. APPRECIATE BOTH OF YOU GUYS\nBEING HERE, THANKS. >> THANKS FOR HAVING US.\n>> ALL THE BEST.",

THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE SEEING\nFROM HILLARY CLINTON. EARLIER IN THIS HOUR YOU TALKED\nABOUT POLLING THAT SAID THAT PEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONS WHETHER OR\nNOT DONALD TRUMP CAN BE PRESIDENTIAL.\nYOU CAN'T HAVE KNEE JERK REACTIONS TO THIS TYPE OF STUFF.\nTHIS IS LIFE AND DEATH MATTERS. THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE WHERE\nDONALD TRUMP IS JUMPING AHEAD MAKING RIDICULOUS STATEMENTS AND\nHILLARY CLINTON IS SHOWING A RESERVED PRAGMATIC APPROACH.\n>> I'M PRETTY SURE WHEN YOU PUT A BUNCH OF WIRES AND EXPLOSIVE\nDEVICES INSIDE A PRESSURE COOKER, IT'S ACCURATE TO CALL IT\nA BOMB. THAT'S WHAT DONALD TRUMP DID.\nIT WAS A BOMB. WE'RE PRETTY SURE IT WASN'T PUT\nTHERE BY THE VIENNA BOYS CLUB. THIS IS SOME TERRORIST ACTIVITY\nEVENT THAT TOOK PLACE IN NEW YORK AND DONALD TRUMP'S REACTION\nWAS RIGHT AND I THINK HILLARY CLINTON -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE\nWAS ON LAST NIGHT, BUT SHE WAS LOW ENERGY I THINK TO SAY THE\nLEAST. >> IT DID NOT EXACTLY SEEM LIKE\nA -- SHALL WE SEE SAY, IF A COMFORTER IN CHIEF, TALKING\nABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER AND BECOME\nSTRONGER TOGETHER DESPITE THAT BEING HER CAMPAIGN SLOGAN.\nYOU TALKED ABOUT THAT POLL THAT WE DISCUSSED EARLIER IN THE\nSHOW. WE'LL PUT IT BACK UP ON THE\nSCREEN SO VIEWERS CAN TAKE A LOOK.\nCLINTON 59%, YES. TRUMP, 59% NO.\nTHIS GOES TO AN ISSUE FOR YOU IN MISSOURI, A SWING STATE AND\nOBVIOUSLY NOW THAT TRUMP IS A REPUBLICAN NOMINEE THE POLLS ARE\nTIGHTER IN MISSOURI THAN ANYBODY EVER THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.\nIS THE ISSUE OF TEMPERAMENT A PROBLEM FOR SOME MISSOURI VOTER\nSNZ. >> IT'S AN ISSUE, ONE OF A\nNUMBER OF ISSUES IN THE ELECTION.\nTHE TRUTH IS DONALD TRUMP'S NUMBERS ARE GETTING STRONGER ALL\nTHE TIME IN MISSOURI. THERE WAS A STATE POLL RELEASED\nTHIS MORNING THAT SHOWS HIM WITH AN 8-POINT LEAD AND GROWING.\nA LOT OF TRENDS YOU'VE BEEN SEEING NATIONALLY WITH A RACE\nTIGHTENING UP HAS BEEN WORKING IN MISSOURI WHERE TRUMP HAS\nGAINED MOMENTUM AND HILLARY CLINTON HAS HAD A DIVE OVER THE\nLAST THREE WEEKS. IT'S GOING TO BE A CLOSE RACE.\n>> THE REALITY IS THIS SHOULD BE A LAY-UP FOR REPUBLICANS IN\nMISSOURI. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS,\nDONALD TRUMP'S BEHAVIOR AND THE WAY HE HAS KNEE-JERK RESPONSES\nTO THINGS, JUST LIKE YOUR POLLING IS SHOWING, IS MAKING\nTHIS RACE MUCH CLOSER THAN IT NEEDS TO BE FOR REPUBLICANS AND\nTHAT MEANS RESOURCES ARE COMING INTO MISSOURI AND ROY BLUNT IS\nLIKELY IN TROUBLE AS A RESULT OF IT.\n>> YOU'VE GOT THE FIRST WORD, I'M GOING TO GIVE JOHN THE LAST\nWORD ON THAT ISSUE. YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT TEMPERAMENT\nIS NEEDED. THIS IS THE SAME MESSAGE DONALD\nTRUMP GAVE AND ANDREW CUOMO ON THE STREETS OF NEW YORK TODAY, A\nDEMOCRAT GETTING UP THERE AND SAYING WE'RE GOING TO BE STRONG\nAND NOT GOING TO LET THEM WIN. IT WAS A MUCH TOUGHER MESSAGE\nFROM THE GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK THAN YOU GOT FROM A PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATE. YOU'VE GOT TO AT LEAST SEE THAT\nAS A VULNERABILITY? >> NO, I THINK TRUMP'S RESPONSE\nWAS GOOD. HE SAID LOOK WE'VE GOT TO GET\nTOUGH ON THESE PEOPLE AND GET BETTER INTELLIGENCE AND TAKE THE\nFIGHT TO THEM. WE'VE GOT TO WEED THESE THINGS\nOIT BEFORE THEY HAPPEN. I THINK TRUMP'S TONE ON\nTERRORISM THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN, THIS GUY WILL CALL IT\nWHAT IT IS, RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM, THE WHITE HOUSE CAN'T\nSEEM TO FIGURE THAT OUT. I THINK ON TERRORISM ON NATIONAL\nSECURITY, I THINK DONALD TRUMP SCORES VERY WELL WITH THE\nVOTERS. >> THE FBI HAD A HARD TIME\nCALLING IT TERRORISM TODAY IN MINNESOTA DESPITE THE ALLAH\nAKBAR AND ASKING PEOPLE IF THEY WERE MUSLIM BEFORE STABBING\nTHEM. WE'LL SEE WHAT THE PRESIDENTND A INY LL STOCLBOAYNUT A IT GOG FORWARD.\nALWAYS GREAT TO HAVE YOU ON THE PROGRAM.\nTHANKS FOR COMING IN AND STAYING LATE.\n>> TAKE IT EASY. >> SEE YOU GUYS.\n>> PRESIDENT OBAMA HAMMERS OUT A MULTIBILLION DOLLAR DEAL WITH\nISRAEL. BUT SOME LAWMAKERS SAY IT'S FULL\nOF DETAILS THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY GOOD ONES FOR ONE OF\nOUR CLOSEST ALLIES. WHAT SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM TOLD\nME ABOUT THE MEETING WITH NETANYAHU COMING UP.",

I WANT YOU TO SEE THIS, BECAUSE\nTHIS IS WORTH TALKING ABOUT, ACTUALLY, WE HAVE FRESH NUMBERS\nFROM THE FOX NEWS POLL THAT ARE SO GOOD.\nHERE IS WHO IS QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT AND THAT IS HILLARY\nCLINTON, 61% TO TRUMP'S 45% AND THEN WE LOOK AT THE OTHER ONE\nWHICH IS PROBABLY EVEN MORE IMPORTANT IN THIS QUESTION, HAS\nTHE TEMPER MEANT TO THE 39ESIDENT, 59% FOR CLINTON AND\nR % LDDOFONA T.RUMP\nCK  MHI HAVE HAD THE TEMPERAMENT\nOF A DRUGGED ZOO ANIMAL BUT IT WAS MORE PRESIDENTIAL AND CALMER\nTHAN TRUMP WHICH SHE WOULD HAVE TO HOPE FOR.\n>> THAT POLL WAS TAKEN BEFORE YESTERDAY.\n>> WE DID NOT CONDUCT THAT PRESIDENT OVERNIGHT.\nWE DID NOT DO THIS OVERNIGHT. THAT IS TRUE.\nTHE POINT IS WHEN BAD THINGS HAPPEN, THE PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT\nTRUMP ITEM SAY, ONLY AS TRUMP SAID, ONLY TRUMP CAN FIX.\nTHE PEOPLE WOULD SUPPORT HILLARY CLINTON SAY ONLY HILLARY CLINTON\nCAN FIX.

THAT IS WHAT HILLARY CLINTON\nBASICALLY IS SAYING LET'S STAY THE COURSE, AND THE QUESTION ON\nTHIS, WHAT TERRORISTS WANT TO DO IS THEY WANT TO CHANGE YOUR WAY\nOF LIFE, THEY WANT TO INSTILL FEAR AND HAVE DOUBT AND SHE IS\nTRYING TO BE VERY CALM AND DONALD TRUMP IS SAYING I WILL DO\nSOMETHING ABOUT IT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY CAN DO.\n>> IN THERE WAS AN EFFORT BY PRESIDENT OBAMA THAT WAS\nSUCCESSFUL, IN TERMS OF COMMUNICATION AND POLITICAL\nCOMMUNICATION IT WAS GETTING AMERICANS TO EXPECT LESS ON THIS\nQUESTION. AMERICAN USE WILL RECALL WHEN\nYOU WERE IN THE HOUSE, WHAT WAS THE LINE?\nWE HAVE TO BE RIGHT EVERY TIME, THE TERRORISTS ONLY HAVE TO BE\nRIGHT ONCE. IN THE TIME OF LONE WOLF\nDOMESTIC TERRORISM, AMERICANS IN THIS ERA, WE TALK ABOUT\nDWAYNEING DEVIANTSCY DOWN, IT IS NOW THE NEW NORMAL EVERY SIX\nMONTHS EVERY SO OFTEN AND WE DO NOT KNOW THE FACTS.\n>> WHAT IS TROUBLING, THE NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS SAID\nIN THE PAST FEW HOURS THE FIVE BOMBS THAT WENT OFF IN NEW\nJERSEY YESTERDAY, ARE RELATED, TO THE ONES THAT WENT OFF HERE\nIN NEW YORK. .WOULD DO YOU THAT?\nA DRY RUN? THE UNIDENTIFIED MALE CAMING\nSUNDAY SAYING THERE WILL BE MORE, MY POINT ON THIS THE\nPOLITICS SIDE, IS THAT DONALD TRUMP HAD A CHOICE, REALLY, HE\nIS THE OUTPARTY CANDIDATE, HE WILL BE DIFFERENT.\nHOW MUCH DIFFERENT CAN HE BE THAT WOULD ACTUALLY AFFECT\nCHANGE AND PROTECT PEOPLE? >> HOW MUCH HAY DID OBAMA MAKE\nNOT FOUR MORE YEARS OF BUSH. >> EIGHT YEARS OUT OF THAT?\n>> RIGHT. AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES. AS IT TURNS OUT.\nTHE BEST POSITION FROM WHICH TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT, AMERICA, IS\nTHE POSITION IN WHICH YOUR PARTY IS NOT IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND\nYOU ON THE OUTSIDE. BECAUSE YOU CAN SAY ANYTHING.\nYOU CAN -- PRESIDENT OBAMA COULD SAY, THERE WAS NEVER FOREIGN\nPOLICY BEFORE 2000. EVERYTHING SINCE 2000 WAS WRONG\nAND EVERYTHING AFTER WILL BE RIGHT.\n>> YOU ARE SAYING JOHN McCAIN HAD A SIMILAR PROBLEM AND\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS THE PROBLEM NOW.\n>> IN SPADES. OF COURSE WITH JOHN McCAIN HE\nHAD IRAQ WAR TO DEFEND. >> NOT TO MENTION THE FINANCIAL\nCRISIS. >> YOU MEAN --.\n>> LET'S NOT GO DOWN MEMORY LAY. >> I DON'T WANT TO RELIVE THAT\nIT HAS TAKEN ME EIGHT YEARS TO RECOVER THE HIGHS ARE JUST NOW\nGOING DOWN FROM EXPECT OF 2008.

IS THAT WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN?\n>> I THINK IT COULD. WE'VE SEEN THAT -- WE SAW THE\nIMPACT AFTER SAN BERNARDINO. >> SADLY.\n>> AND THE EFFECT ON THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE --\n>> IN ORLANDO -- >> AND ORLANDO.\nAND THIS IS A POSSIBILITY. YOU HAVE A VERY DEEP DIVISION IN\nWHICH THE REPUBLICANS AND DONALD TRUMP ARE WILLING TO IDENTIFY\nTHE MORE LIKELY ASPECTS OF THIS, WHICH IS TERRORISM AND ISLAMIC\nEXTREME TERRORISM. DEMOCRATS AND OTHERS SEEM TO BE\nRELUCTANT -- THEY STILL DON'T WANT TO USE THOSE WORDS AND THEY\nKEEP SAYING IT COULD BE ANYTHING BUT IT ALWAYS ENDS UP BEING THE\nSAME, LIKE IN MINNESOTA. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, PEOPLE HAVE\nGOT TO ASK, I WAS HERE IN NEW YORK LAST NIGHT, NEAR THAT PLACE\nAFTER IT HAPPENED, WALKING. YOU KNOW, IT IS A SHOCK TO YOU.\nBECAUSE YOU GOT A BOMB, THEN YOU HAVE ANOTHER ONE THAT DIDN'T GO\nOFF. YOU HAVE THE ONE IN NEW JERSEY,\nWHICH WAS FORGOTTEN FOR A WHILE DOWN THERE.\n>> ON THE SHORE DOWN THERE. >> AND THE THREE BOUND TOGETHER\nAND DIDN'T GO OFF. SO THEY ARE NOT QUITE GETTING\nTHE BOMBING TOGETHER. BUT YOU HAVE TO THINK THESE ARE\nNOT ISOLATED INCIDENTS UNLESS YOU THINK, BOY, THAT IS A BIG\nCOINCIDENCE. CLEARLY THE ONE IN MINNEAPOLIS,\nISIS CLAIMS CREDIT. IT IS A SOLDIER.\nTHAT IS THE WAY THEY DO IT. PEOPLE HAVE GOT TO SAY, THIS IS\nHAPPENING AGAIN. AND WE HAVE ALL SAID ALL ALONG,\nTHIS IS THE KIND OF EVENT THAT CAN INFLUENCE A RACE FOR TRUMP\nBECAUSE I THINK HE'S PROBABLY VIEWED AS MUCH TOUGHER ON THE\nSTUFF. >> INTERESTING.\nSO EARLIER IN THE HOUR, JOHN, I SHARED WITH EVERYBODY, WE SAW\nHILLARY CLINTON'S COMMENTS RIGHT AFTER THE EXPLOSIONS LAST NIGHT.\nBUT THEN TODAY, JUST ABOUT THREE HOURS AGO, ISSUED A STATEMENT,\nISIS HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK IN MINNESOTA.\nIT GOES ON TO SAY SHE HAS A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO TAKE OUT\nISIS. AND AGAIN, WE DON'T KNOW ALL --\nWHAT IS HAPPENING IN NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY.\nBUT WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT THE QUESTION OF WHO KEEPS US SAFE?\n>> WELL, I GUESS IT IS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER.\nTHE TRUMP PEOPLE ALREADY THINK HE'LL KEEP US SAFE.\nTHE HILLARY PEOPLE THINK SHE WILL.\nWE'RE HERE TALKING ABOUT 15% OF THE VOTERS, I THINK, THAT ARE\nEITHER UNDECIDED OR SOFT AND COULD --\n>> IS THAT A BIG NUMBER TO YOU. >> YEAH, IT IS A BIG NUMBER.\n20. CALL IT 20.\n>> SECRETARY CLINTON DOESN'T WANT TO BE BEHIND THE CURVE.\nASKING OUT LOUD WHAT HAPPENED WHEN IT IS PRETTY CLEAR, AS PAT\nSUGGESTED, THAT THERE IS -- >> SO YOU THINK THAT STATEMENT\nWAS POLITICAL. >> I THINK THE SECOND STATEMENT\nWAS DEFINITELY POLITICAL BECAUSE SHE IS SCARED TO DEATH TO BE\nBEHIND THE CURVE. >> THE FIRST STATEMENT WAS\nTERRIBLE, I THOUGHT. IT WAS HER GOING, ON THE ONE\nHAND AND DONALD TRUMP CAME OUT AND SAID IT IS A BOMBING AND\nEVERYBODY WATCHING TV KNEW, HEY, THOSE EXPLOSION AND PEOPLE HURT\nAND THAT IS A BOMBING AND HE GET AS TACK BY THE MEDIA SAYING OH,\nHE JUMPED TO CONCLUSION. NO, HE SEEMS TO BE AHEAD OF THE\nCURVE ON IT AND THAT IS WHY THEY ARE TRYING TO CATCH UP.\n>> ONE THING IS FOR SURE, THE FACTS THAT WE DO KNOW ARE BOTH\nCANDIDATES ARE GETTING NATIONAL SECURITY BRIEFINGS.\n>> RIGHT. >> RIGHT.\nSO THEY ARE GOING TO SEE THINGS THAT THE PUBLIC DON'T KNOW ABOUT\nOR DON'T KNOW IF IT WILL HAVE WITH REGARD TO ANYTHING\nHAPPENING IN THE LAST 24 HOURS BUT CERTAINLY IN TOTAL.\n>> LET ME GO BACK. I DON'T THINK THAT WE'VE HAD\nLEON, PARIS, SAN BERNARDINO HERE AT HOME AND NOW THIS THING HERE,\nI DON'T THINK ANY OF THESE HAVE ALTERED THE RACE.\nI DON'T THINK TRUMP HAS GAINED AT ALL AFTER THOSE INCIDENTS.\nI THINK WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THIS RACE IS THEY ARE EACH\nSHOOTING THEIR FEET OFF AND THAT IS WHAT CHANGES THE RACE.\nHILLARY HAS THREE BAD WEEKS WHERE ALL OF THE LIES ABOUT\nE-MAILS AND THE SERVER COME OUT. THIS -- THIS HORRIBLE COMMENT\nABOUT A BASKET OF DEPLORABLES, SHE GOES DOWN.\nTRUMP HAS REPEATEDLY SHOT HIS FEET OFF AND YET --\n>> YOU ARE REFERRING TO THE BIRTHER COMMENT.\n>> OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST YEAR.\nTHERE HAVE BEEN THINGS THAT HE SAID THAT INTERRUPT HIS OWN\nMOMENTUM. >> BY THE WAY, I LOOK AT --\n>> EVERYBODY WANTS CHANGE AND HE HARNESSES THE CHANGE AND HE\nRISES A LITTLE BIT AND THEN SAYS SOMETHING AND STOPS HIS\nMOVEMENT. IT HURTS --\n>> AND THIS IS MY QUESTION. BECAUSE YOU KNOW, YOU MAY LOOK\nAT IT NEGATIVELY, BUT HE CONTROLS THE NEWS CYCLE A LOT OF\nTIMES WITH THE THINGS THAT LOOK LIKE HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO CLEAN\nIT UP. >> AS THE BIRTHER THING ON\nFRIDAY WAS BAD. >> HOW DID IT GO FOR HIM, DO YOU\nTHINK? >> BAD.\n>> BADLY. BECAUSE HE IS BACK AND FORTH --\n>> YOU DON'T THINK HE PUT IT TO BED FACING A NEW WEEK?\n>> NO. >> WILL IT COME UP AGAIN THIS\nWEEK. >> TODAY IT WAS ON ALL OF THE\nSHOWS AND THEY WERE ALL ABOUT BIRTHERS.\n>> THEY MAY NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT TERRORISM.\n>> WELL, BUT THEY -- >> I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU MEAN BY\n\"THEY\". >> THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA SHOWS.\n>> AND THE QUESTION IS, IT IS A WEEK AWAY.\nI WOULD BE SURPRISED IF -- I THINK IT IS --\n>> IF LESTER HOLT DOESN'T RAISE IT, BUT IF THAT HAPPENS IT IS A\nDETRIMENT FOR TRUMP. >> IT IS NOT THE MESSAGE MAKING,\nPOLITICS NECESSARILY OUT OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED BUT THE QUESTION IS\nWHO KEEPS US SAFER. >> I GUESS.\n>> AND TRUMP AND HILLARY BOTH HAVE TO DEVELOP A COHERENT\nNARRATIVE. >> AND ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION.\n>> AND WHAT YOU ARE SAYING, WHEN TRUMP GOES OFF AN A TANGENT, HE\nWEAKENS THAT ARGUMENT. >> AND THEN HE'S HAD NOW, LET'S\nMAKE IT CLEAR, THERE ARE SEVERAL TIMES WHEN HE CAME OUT OF THE\nPUBLIC CONVENTION AND HAD MOMENTUM.\n>> WE HAD TO GO.

BUT HERS ARE ABOUT 10 OR 11\nPOINTS WORSE IN MARGIN THAN TRUMPS AND THAT IS SHOWING UP ON\nOTHER QUESTIONS LIKE WHO WILL TELL THE TRUTH AND THINGS LIKE\nTHAT. HE'S NOT IN GREAT SHAPE.\nBUT IT IS IMPORTANT. SHE HAS, AS YOU TALKED ABOUT\nEARLIER, EXPERIENCE. THE FAVOR ABILITY RATINGS ARE\nVERY EVEN. THE RACE IS HANGING ON, AS DOUG\nSAID, WHO WILL GRAB THE NARRATIVE.\nWHO -- IS THIS A RACE ABOUT WHO SHOULD BE PRESIDENT,\nPERSONALITY-WISE OR IS THIS ABOUT CHANGING THE COUNTRY.\nNEITHER OF THEM HAVE SEEN -- >> I'VE GIVEN UP, PAT.\nWE HAVE SAT HERE, THE THREE OF US --\n>> OVER AND OVER. >> FOR A YEAR AND SAY GRAB THE\nPOSITIVE NARRATIVE AND TAKE THE COUNTRY ALONG WITH YOU, WE WON'T\nDO IT IN THE LAST SEVEN WEEKS.

BECAUSE THIS ELECTION ULTIMATELY\nIS A -- A RARE FRIEND OF MINE, THE INCUMBENT AND SECRETARY\nCLINTON.

I SOMETIMES THINK IF THEY CALL\nIT TERRORISM IT MEANS THEY ARE NOT WINNING THE FIGHT AGAINST\nTHIS ISLAMIC TERRORISM AND THE VIOLENT EXTREMISM AS THEY CALL\nIT.

THEY WANT WASHINGTON SHAKEN UP.\nHILLARY CLINTON DOESN'T OFFER ANY TYPE OF CHANGE.\nSHE HAS TO CONVINCE PEOPLE WHO ARE HAPPY WITH THE WAY THE\nCOUNTRY IS GOING SHE HAS TO MOTIVATE THEM TO VOTE AND TO\nSOMEHOW MAKE DONALD TRUMP LOOK UNACCEPTABLE TO UNDECIDED\nVOTERS. TRUMP NEEDS TO CONTINUE AS HE\nHAS DONE THIS WEEK SHOWING MOMENTUM IN THE POLLS.\nWHY? BECAUSE LATE DECIDERS WANT TO BE\nWITH THE WINNER. AND THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE\nBEST WEEKS FOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN BECAUSE HE HAS CLOSED\nTHE GAP IN MANY STATES AND IN SOME STATES HE IS NOW ACTUALLY\nUP. AND FOR LATE DECIDERS THEY WANT\nTO BE WITH A WINNER AND THE MOMENTUM HE HAS RIGHT NOW WILL\nDO A LOT FOR HIM TO GET UNDECIDED VOTERS AND KEEP HIS SUPPORTERS MOTIVATED.\n>> WHAT IS INTERESTING IS THAT AS THE MAPS ARE COMING OUT AND\nWITH THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE, ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT STATES IS\nFLORIDA. AND IT APPEARS THAT ACCORDING TO\nCERTAIN POLLS THEY DO EACH OF THEM IN FLORIDA VIEW TRUMP AND\nHILLARY AS EQUALLY UNFAVORABLE.

AND ANOTHER BIG NUMBER THAT CAME\nOUT FOR TRUMP THIS WEEK, 51% OF AMERICANS THINK HE WOULD DO A\nBETTER JOB THAN HILLARY CLINTON WOULD AT CREATING JOBS AND\nIMPROVING THE ECONOMY. WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT, JUDGE?\nIF YOU LOOK AT THE CROSS TABS ON HOW TRUMP GOT THE NOMINATION AND\nHOW HE DID WELL AMONG EVANGELICALS AND FIRST-TIME\nREPUBLICANS AND LONG-TIME REPUBLICANS.\nHE WON THE CATEGORY BECAUSE PEOPLE SAID THEY LIKED HIS\nPOSITION ON CREATING JOBS AND GETTING THE ECONOMY MOVING.\n>> HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN STRONG ON THAT.\nTHANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH US THIS EVENING.\n>> THANKS, JUDGE.",

THE BLAST RIPPED THROUGH THE\nBUSY CHELSEA NEIGHBORHOOD AROUND 8:30 P.M., INJURING 29 PEOPLE,\nONE OF THEM SERIOUSLY. CAMERAS IN A GYM ACROSS THE\nSTREET, YOU ARE SEEING WHAT IT CAUGHT ON TAPE OF THE EXPLOSION.\nTHE FORCE WAS ENOUGH TO SHATTER THE GYM'S GLASS DOORS.\nJUST A FEW BLOCKS AWAY, POLICE THEN DISCOVERED A SECOND\nSUSPICIOUS DEVICE, A PRESSURE COOKER OUTFITTED WITH EXTRA\nWIRES AND A CELL PHONE. THAT SETUP WAS REMOVED FROM THE\nSCENE. IT WAS TAKEN TO A FACILITY FOR\nANALYSIS. IN A NEWS CONFERENCE A SHORT\nTIME AGO, GOVERNOR CUOMO TOLD NEW YORKERS, DON'T BE AFRAID.\n>> WHOEVER PLACED THESE BOMBS, WE WILL FIND AND THEY WILL BE\nBROUGHT TO JUSTICE. PERIOD.\nTHIS IS FREEDOM, THIS IS DEMOCRACY.\nAND WE'RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW THEM TO TAKE THAT FROM US.\n>> AS WE AWAIT THE NEWS CONFERENCE, WE HAVE A NUMBER OF\nREPORTS COVERING THE NEWEST ANGLES ON THIS STORY.\nTHAT NEWS CONFERENCE SET TO BEGIN SHORTLY.\nPETE WILLIAMS IS IN WASHINGTON ON THE INVESTIGATION.\nHALLIE JACKSON AND KRISTIN WELKER HAVE REACTION FROM THE\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES. WHAT ARE WE EXPECTED TO HEAR AT\nTHE BRIEFING? >> Reporter: WE'RE EXPECTING TO\nHEAR MORE DETAILS ABOUT THOSE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES.\nWE DID LEARN NEW INFORMATION FROM THE GOVERNOR WHO ABOUT AN\nHOUR AGO HE WALKED THE SCENE AND HE SAID THAT BOTH OF THE\nBUILDINGS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE EXPLOSION SEVERE DAMAGE.\nHE SAID BASED ON THE DAMAGE THAT HE SAW, HE WAS SURPRISED NOBODY\nWAS MORE SEVERELY INJURED. AS YOU RECALL, 29 PEOPLE\nINJURED. HE SAYS ALL OF THE PEOPLE HAVE\nBEEN RELEASED FROM THE HOSPITAL. HE ALSO TELLS US THAT BOTH OF\nTHE DEVICES -- THE ONE THAT WENT OFF AS WELL AS THE ONE THAT DID\nNOT DETONATE -- WHICH WAS THE PRESSURE COOKER, THEY WERE\nSIMILAR IN DESIGN AND WILL BE PROCESSED.\nHE ALSO SAID AS WELL, THE EXPLOSIVE DEVICE THAT WENT OFF\nYESTERDAY MORNING IN SEASIDE PARK, AN HOUR AND A HALF OUTSIDE\nOF THE CITY, THAT WILL BE SENT TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY LINK.\nTHERE IS NO FURTHER THREAT HERE IN NEW YORK CITY.\nBUT THEY ARE PUTTING OUT 1,000 EXTRA NEW YORK STATE POLICE\nOFFICERS AS WELL AS THE NATIONAL GUARD.\nTHEY WILL BE AT AIRPORTS, BUSES, SUBWAY STATIONS.\nLET'S LISTEN IN TO A LITTLE BIT MORE OF WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAD TO\nSAY. >> AS GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK, THIS\nIS MY WORST NIGHTMARE. RIGHT?\nMY WORST NIGHTMARE IS THE PHONE RINGS LATE AT NIGHT AND THERE'S\nSOME TERRORIST ATTACK, EMERGENCY, FLOOD, HURRICANE, ACT\nOF MOTHER NATURE, THAT PUTS LIVES IN PERIL.\nSO THIS IS THE NIGHTMARE SCENARIO.\nWHEN YOU SEE THE DAMAGE, I THINK WE WERE FORTUNATE THAT THERE\nWERE NO FATALITIES. AND WHEN YOU SEE THE SITE\nITSELF, IT JUST CONFIRMS THAT. THIS WAS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF\nDAMAGE. >> Reporter: SOMETHING THAT\nCOULD TURN OUT TO BE A KEY PIECE OF EVIDENCE, THERE IS VIDEO OF A\nMAN PUTTING SOMETHING IN THAT TRASH DUMPSTER BEFORE THE\nEXPLOSION. THEY ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF\nTHIS MAN HAS ANY CONNECTION, WHO HE IS AND WHAT HE WAS DOING IN\nTHE AREA BEFORE THE EXPLOSION. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH.\nWE AWAIT THE NEWS CONFERENCE COMING OUR WAY ANY MINUTE NOW.\nLET'S GO TO NBC NEWS JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT PETE WILLIAMS IN\nWASHINGTON FOR US. A GOOD DAY TO YOU.\nWHAT ARE YOUR SOURCES TELLING YOU ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION?\n>> Reporter: THE KEY THING HERE WILL BE INSPECTING ALL THESE\nBOMB PARTS. THE DEVICE IN NEW JERSEY DIDN'T\nGO OFF COMPLETELY. IT'S LARGELY INTACT.\nTHE DEVICE IN NEW YORK ON 27th STREET IS COMPLETELY INTACT.\nTHEN, OF COURSE, YOU HAVE PIECES FROM WHAT WAS FOUND ON 23rd\nSTREET IN NEW YORK, THE ONE THAT DID GO OFF.\nTHIS IS THE INTACT ONE WITH THE HOLE DRILLED IN THE TOP, SOME\nKIND OF TIMER. THIS SORT OF METHOD OF APPROACH\nIS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT HAS BEEN OUT THERE ON THE INTERNET FOR\nTHE LAST SIX YEARS ON HOW TO BUILD A DEVICE IN A PRESSURE\nCOOKER. IT WAS FOLLOWED LARGELY BY THE\nBOSTON MARATHON BOMBERS. IT'S NOT DISTINCTIVE.\nWHAT THE FBI AT QUANTICO WILL LOOK AT AS THEY COMPARE ALL THE\nEXPLOSIVE DEVICES AND THE PIECES FROM NEW YORK IS, ARE THERE\nCOMMONALITIES IN THE WAY THE THINGS WERE CONSTRUCTED IN\nPRECISELY HOW THE HOLES WERE DRILLED, HOW THE WIRES WERE\nCONNECTED, WHAT KINDS OF TIMERS, WHAT KINDS OF CELL PHONES WERE\nUSED, WHAT WAS THE EXPLOSIVE MATERIAL INSIDE THEM, DO THEY\nHAVE THAT IN COMMON? AS OPPOSED TO THE ONE IN NEW\nJERSEY WHICH WAS PIPE BOMBS. THREE PIPE BOMBS WRAPPED\nTOGETHER. ONE OF WHICH WENT OFF.\nIT MAY NOT HAVE GONE OFF COMPLETELY.\nALSO FOLLOWING SIMILAR INSTRUCTIONS THAT ARE ON THE\nINTERNET. THAT'S ONE KEY THING THAT THE\nINVESTIGATORS ARE FOLLOWING. WE STILL AREN'T 100% POSITIVE BY\nTHE WAY, ALEX, BECAUSE WE HAVE STILL CONFLICTING INFORMATION\nFROM THE AUTHORITIES WHETHER THE DEVICE IN NEW YORK ON THE 23rd\nSTREET LOCATION THAT DID BLOW UP WITH SUCH TREMENDOUS FORCE,\nWHETHER IT WAS ACTUALLY PLAYED IN THE DUMPSTER OR NEAR TO IT.\nIF IT'S IN THE DUMPSTER, WELL, THAT SUGGESTS SORT OF SIMILAR\nAPPROACH TO NEW JERSEY. THE ONE IN NEW JERSEY WAS IN A\nPLASTIC GARBAGE CAN ALONG THE ROUTE.\nTHESE ARE ALL QUESTIONS THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT.\nTHEN, OF COURSE THE ADDITIONAL FACTOR THAT YOU HAVE ALL THIS\nSURVEILLANCE VIDEO FROM NEW YORK.\nSO YOU CAN LOOK AT, FOR EXAMPLE, THE VIDEO OF SOMEBODY THROWING\nSOMETHING IN THE DUMPSTER AND THEN GO AROUND TO SURVEILLANCE\nCAMERAS THAT ARE FURTHER AWAY FROM THE SITE.\nTHAT PERSON APPROACHED FROM SOMEWHERE.\nDID THE CAMERAS PICK THAT PERSON UP FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE?\nHOW FAR OUT CAN THAT BE TRACED TO GIVE THEM MORE INFORMATION\nABOUT WHO THAT PERSON WAS? WHETHER THAT'S SOMEBODY DUMPING\nGARBAGE INTO THE DUMPSTER OR PLACED THE BOMB.\n>> LET ME ASK YOU THIS. WE ARE LOOKING AT VIDEO AT\nDIFFERENT POINTS THAT WE HAVE GOTTEN ACCESS TO, THIS\nSURVEILLANCE VIDEO. HOW MUCH MORE IS THERE OUT THERE\nTHAT YOU BELIEVE POLICE MAY HAVE THEIR HANDS ON?\nHOW MUCH MORE CAN THEY LEARN FROM THAT?\n>> Reporter: WELL, I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH MORE THEY HAVE. UNDOUBTEDLY, IT'S MORE THAN WE\nARE ABLE TO SHOW. WHAT WE ARE SHOWING IS WHAT THE\nSTORES AND BUSINESSES LIKE THIS GYM, FOR EXAMPLE, HAVE GIVEN US\nDIRECTLY. BUT THEY WILL GO TO ALL THE\nSURVEILLANCE CAMERAS. THERE ARE SO MANY OF THEM IN NEW\nYORK CITY. THIS WAS ONE OF THE IMPORTANT\nTHINGS IN INVESTIGATING BOSTON MARATHON BOMBING.\nIT'S THAT PIECING TOGETHER OF MOVEMENTS THAT WILL BE\nIMPORTANT. THEY WILL WORK OUT IN CIRCLES\nAWAY FROM THE SCENE ON 23rd STREET AND ON 27th STREET, TOO.\nTHEY WILL WANT TO SEE WHO PLACED THAT, WAS THAT PICKED UP BY A\nCAMERA. CAN YOU LOOK AT NEARBY CAMERAS\nAND TRACE THE MOVEMENTS OF THAT PERSON?\nAS THEY APPROACH THE SCENE. THAT'S THE ADVANTAGE OF THE\nVIDEO, NOT JUST WHAT YOU FIND AT THE SCENE ITSELF, BUT CAN YOU\nNOW TRACE THAT PERSON'S MOVEMENTS USING OTHER CAMERAS?\nTHAT'S A BIG PART OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING NOW.\n>> OKAY. PETE WILLIAMS IN WASHINGTON WITH\nTHE LATEST. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT.\nLET ME BRING IN FORMER ASSISTANT SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE OF THE\nFBI JOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCE JOHN BERELLI.\nA COUPLE OF THINGS I WANT TO GO OVER.\nTHE GOVERNOR CAME AND SAID THAT HE DOES NOT BELIEVE THIS WAS\nLINKED TO INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.\nBUT IT'S STILL VERY EARLY ON IN THIS INVESTIGATION.\nCAN ANYTHING REALLY BE RULED OUT AT THIS POINT?\nWOULD HE BE SAYING THAT BECAUSE THERE'S NO -- SOMEONE TAKING\nRESPONSIBILITY OR NOTE OR ANYTHING?\n>> I THINK THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO RESPONSIBILITY CLAIMED YET\nIS WHY PEOPLE ARE SAYING THIS ISN'T AN INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM\nINCIDENT LIKE ISIS-INSPIRED ORDER AL QAEDA THING.\nI THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT THIS IS AN ACT OF TERRORISM.\nBY JUDICIAL STATUTE, YOU HAVE A WEAPON OF MASS DESTRUCTION THAT\nWAS USED, THIS BOMB. SO THAT FALLS INTO TERRORISM.\nWHAT THE INSPIRATION, DOMESTIC, INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM,\nWHATEVER YET TO BE DETERMINED. THE AUTHORITIES ARE ACTING UNDER\nTHE UMBRELLA THIS IS AN ACT OF TERRORISM.\n>> HERE WE ARE 16 HOURS LATER SINCE THE FIRST INCIDENT.\nWHERE IS THE INVESTIGATION AT THIS STAGE?\n>> MULTIPLE TRACKS. YOU HAVE YOU HAVE A LOT OF\nANALYSIS OF VIDEO BEING DONE. CAN THEY GET AN IMAGE OF A\nPERSON OR PERSONS RESPONSIBLE FOR PUTTING THESE DEVICES IN\nPLACE? THEN YOU'VE GOT THE COLLECTED\nEVIDENCE, THE UNEXPLODE AND REMNANTS OF THE EXPLODED DEVICE\nTHAT ARE AT QUANTICO. THEY WILL BE LOOKING FOR\nTHINGS -- LIKE FINGERPRINTS, HAIR AND FIBER.\nTHEY WILL LOOK AT THE COMPONENTS.\nWAS THIS SOPHISTICATED OR AMATEUR DEVICE?\nIS THERE DATA THAT CAN BE EXPLOITED TO SAY WHAT CELL\nTOWERS? DID IT START IN NEW YORK?\nDID IT COME FROM NEW JERSEY? THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION OUT\nTHERE. IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME TO PUT\nIT TOGETHER. AS OF RIGHT NOW, THERE'S A GOOD\nAMOUNT OF LEADS FOR INVESTIGATORS TO FOLLOW.\n>> YOU MENTIONED NEW JERSEY. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED\nIN SEASIDE PARK PREVIOUSLY YESTERDAY EARLIER IN THE DAY\nWHERE AN EXPLOSION WENT OFF. FORTUNATELY, NOBODY WAS INJURED\nBECAUSE IT DIDN'T GO OFF WHEN PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN RUNNING\nBY IN THIS 5K RUN. ARE THERE THINGS ABOUT THAT THAT\nLEAD YOU INSTINCTIVELY TO BELIEVE IT'S CONNECTED OR NOT\nCONNECTED? >> AS OF NOW -- WE DON'T KNOW\nALL THE FACTS. MY GUT TELLS ME, PROBABLY NOT\nCONNECTED. THE REASON IS, YOU HAVE JUST\nSUCH DIFFERENT DEVICES. YOU HAD THE PIPE BOMBS THAT WERE\nWRAPPED TOGETHER VERSUS THIS PRESSURE COOKER.\nGENERALLY WHEN A PERSON IS A BOMB MAKER, THEY USUALLY HAVE A\nSIGNATURE. THEY FIGURE OUT THE WAY THEY\nLIKE TO CONSTRUCT A DEVICE AND FOLLOW THAT SAME PATTERN EVERY\nTIME. INVESTIGATORS AT THE FBI HAVE\nBEEN FOLLOWING FOR YEARS PATTERNS OF BOMB MAKERS.\nTHERE ARE PEOPLE THAT PRACTICE AND GET THEIR FINGERS BLOWN OFF.\nNOW, IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THE INCIDENTS AREN'T CONNECTED.\nBUT KIND OF INSTINCTIVELY, I WOULD SAY, PROBABLY NOT AT THIS\nPOINT. >> ANYTHING IN TERMS OF\nLISTENING TO NETWORKS, TALKING ABOUT CHATTER, POSSIBLE ATTACKS\nIN THE AREA? WE HAVE THE PRESIDENT, HE WILL\nBE HERE. IT'S THE U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY.\nWE HAVE FOREIGN DIGNITARIES HERE IN NEW YORK CITY.\n>> THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS TO CONSIDER RIGHT NOW.\nOF COURSE, SOCIAL MEDIA INVESTIGATORS AND THE\nINTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, THEY WILL LOOK AT CHATTER OR ANYBODY\nONLINE WITH A CLAIM OF RESPONSIBILITY.\nTHEY WILL LOOK, DOES SOMEBODY SAY SOMETHING ONLINE THAT LEADS\nINVESTIGATORS TO BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE MORE KNOWLEDGE THAN\nWHAT'S BEEN PUBLICALLY RELEASED? YOU HAVE THE U.N. RIGHT NOW, ALL\nTHE DELEGATIONS ARRIVING. WAS THIS JUST SOMETHING TO\nDIVERT RESOURCES FROM THE WEST SIDE OF MANHATTAN TO THE EAST\nSIDE WHERE ALL THE U.N. PEOPLE ARE?\nWAS IT DESIGNED TO LOOK AT THE POLICE RESPONSE AND THEN TAKE\nNOTES AND THEN THE NEXT ONE MAYBE BE MORE LETHAL?\nTHERE'S SO MANY THINGS TO CONSIDER.\nWHO KNOWS RIGHT NOW? >> I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO STAY\nWITH ME IN THE STUDIO. WE ARE AWAITING THIS NEWS\nCONFERENCE. THIS IS GOING TO BE FROM MAYOR\nBILL de BLASIO AND THE NEWLY CORONATED, IF YOU WILL, NYPD\nCOMMISSIONER, JAMES O'NEILL. TALK ABOUT ONE WAY TO GET\nSTARTED ON THE JOB. HE TOOK OVER FRIDAY WHEN BILL\nBRATTON RESIGNED. OR RETIRED, WE SHOULD SAY.\nANYWAY, WE ARE GOING TO STAY ON THIS AND TAKE A SHORT BREAK HERE\nAND BRING YOU BACK WITH THE NEWS ERCON HEE SIDE.\nSTAY WITH US.",

              "text": "NOBODY IS REALLY GOING TO GO OUT\nON A LIMB AND SAY IT WAS LINKED TO THESE THINGS.\nLEGALLY, THIS CAN FALL UNDER THE DEFINITION OF TERRORISM.\nYOU HAVE THIS PRESSURE COOKER BOMB THAT WAS -- THE LEGAL\nDEFINITION OF A WEAPON OF MASS DESTRUCTION, WHICH IS A\nTERRORISM LAW. IT'S A FEDERAL LAW ON THE BOOKS.\nI THINK KIND OF IN GENERAL, YOU COULD SAY THAT THIS IS AN ACT OF\nTERRORISM. YOU CAN'T SAY WHAT THE\nMOTIVATION IS. WHAT'S THE SOCIAL OR POLITICAL\nAGENDA BEHIND IT? >> INTENTIONAL, VIOLENT,\nCRIMINAL AND BOMBING, THAT CERTAINLY IS NOT UP FOR DEBATE.\nTHOSE THINGS ARE CORRECT. WITH REGARD TO THE POLICE\nPRESENCE THAT'S GOING TO BE OUT AND ABOUT HERE, I CAN SAY COMING\nINTO WORK TODAY, THIS ON THE EVE OF THE U.N. AGAIN ASSEMBLY\nBEGINNING, I CAME THROUGH A GROUP OF SEVERAL HUNDRED POLICE\nOFFICERS ALL IN UNIFORM, CLEARLY A STAGING AREA.\nIT WASN'T THAT FAR FROM SPECIFIC HOTELS WHERE A LOT OF OUR\nFOREIGN DIGNITARIES WILL STAY AND THE U.N. ISN'T ALL THAT FAR\nFROM HERE. HOW MUCH SHOULD PEOPLE EXPECT TO\nSEE AND NOT SEE IN THE DAYS AHEAD?\n>> YOU WILL SEE AND NOT SEE A LOT.\nDURING THE UNITED NATIONS, THERE'S ALWAYS COMMAND POSTS SET\nUP. YOU WILL SEE RESOURCES.\nYOU WILL SEE VANS, SPECIALIZED UNITS, BOMB DOGS, ROBOTS, THINGS\nLIKE THAT. IT'S NOT JUST THE NYPD.\nTHERE'S FEDERAL ASSETS THAT ARE BROUGHT TO BEAR DURING THIS\nWEEK. IF YOU ADD THE BOMB INCIDENT\nTHAT TOOK PLACE LAST NIGHT, YOU ARE GOING TO SEE EVEN MORE\nRESOURCES. CERTAINLY THE FEDS ARE GOING TO\nHAVE MORE RESOURCES BROUGHT, THE PD, THEY WILL HAVE THEIR\nCOUNTERTERRORISM UNITS OUT TO SHOW THAT DISPLAY OF FORCE.\nI THINK PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN NEW YORK WON'T BE SURPRISED.\nA LOT OF WHAT'S NOT SEEN IS ALL THE VIDEO AND SOME OF THE\nSPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT, THE CAMERAS AND THE LIKE.\nTHERE WILL BE A LOT OF RESOURCES BROUGHT TO BEAR ON THIS.\n>> BEYOND JUST WHETHER OR NOT THE MAYOR IS GOING TO BE\nCOMFORTABLE USING THE WORD TERRORISM, WHAT WAS IT YOU TOOK\nAWAY FROM THIS? I KNOW SOMETHING THAT I TOOK,\nTHE VIDEO, THE FACT THAT WE HAVE PROBABLY NOT SEEN -- THE PD HAS\nPROBABLY NOT SEEN ALL THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE TO THEM.\nOBVIOUSLY, THEY WERE VERY GUARDED.\nI'M SURE THERE'S A LOT MORE INFORMATION AND DIFFERENT\nINVESTIGATIVE THEORIES THAT ARE BEING RUN AGROUND AS WE SPEAK.\nNOBODY IN THAT PRESS CONFERENCE IS GOING TO GO ON AND DISCLOSE\nANY OF THAT INFORMATION, BECAUSE IT COULD JEOPARDIZE THE\nINVESTIGATION. CERTAINLY, THERE'S INFORMATION\nOUT THERE ONLINE THAT THEY MUST BE LOOKING AT.\nTHERE MAY BE EVEN PEOPLE THAT HAVE CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY BUT\nTHAT NEEDS TO BE VETTED. YOU CERTAINLY DON'T WANT OTHER\nCOPYCATS TO DO THAT AND THEN DISRUPT THE FLOW OF THE\nINVESTIGATION. >> I'M LOOKING AT THE TIME LINE.\nIT'S BEEN ABOUT 12 HOURS SINCE THE SECONDARY DEVICE WAS\nDISCOVERED ON 27th STREET, TWO HOURS LATER, IT WAS TAKEN AWAY\nFOR ANALYSIS. PUTTING THAT TOGETHER, IT'S BEEN\nTEN HOURS OR SO. ARE YOU SURPRISED THAT WE'RE NOT\nHEARING ANYTHING DEFINITIVE ABOUT WHETHER THAT WAS A LIVE\nBOMB, THAT PRESSURE COOKER, WHETHER IT WAS EMPTY?\nWE DON'T KNOW. >> WE DON'T KNOW.\nI'M NOT SURPRISED. IT'S IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF AN\nINVESTIGATION WITH MULTIPLE CRIME SCENES, WITH AN ACTUAL\nEXPLOSION, WITH AN UNEXPLODED DEVICE, IT'S STILL VERY EARLY\nON. KIND OF THE TIME LINE OF THESE\nTHINGS. THERE MAY BE SOME REALLY GOOD\nLEADS THAT THE NYPD AND THE FBI ARE EXPLORING RIGHT NOW, BUT\nTHEY DON'T WANT TO GO AND GIVE THAT TOO MUCH INFORMATION TO THE\nPUBLIC AT THIS POINT BECAUSE IT MIGHT JEOPARDIZE THE\nINVESTIGATION. WE JUST DON'T KNOW.\nEVERYBODY WANTS ANSWERS, BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE\nPATIENT. >> YOU MENTIONED THE PUBLIC.\nIT SEEMS TO BEAR REPEATING THAT IT REALLY -- A LOT OF THIS CAN\nFALL ON THE SHOULDERS OF THE PUBLIC, WHAT THEY HAVE SEEN,\nWHAT THEY KNOW. EVEN JUST A SENSE.\n>> ABSOLUTELY. WE SAW WHAT CROWD SOURCING DID\nFOR THE BOSTON MARATHON INVESTIGATION.\nIT WOULD BE GREAT IF THEY ARE ABLE TO RECOVER SOME VIDEO AND\nSOME PHOTOS. IF, IN FACT, THEY DON'T HAVE ANY\nGOOD LEADS AND GET THAT INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC, CROWD\nSOURCE THING. I'M SURE THAT'S A BIG COMPONENT\nOF WHAT THEY'RE DOING NOW. THE CHIEF TALKED ABOUT SOME OF\nTHESE CAMERAS AND THE CHIPS AND VARIOUS -- WHEREVER THESE IMAGES\nARE STORED MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE YET BECAUSE IF THEY ARE\nPROPRIETARY, THEY BELONG TO A STORE OWNER.\nWE WILL SEE. >> WHAT DO YOU THINK THE TIME\nFRAME IS FOR ACCESSING ALL OF THIS VIDEO, GETTING THE\nINVESTIGATORS TO LOOK THROUGH EVERYTHING AND FIGURE OUT IF\nTHEY SEE SOMETHING AS THAT ONE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER\nSUGGESTED, YOU HAVE TO LOOK BEFORE THE BOMBING.\n>> THEY WILL PUT A LOT OF RESOURCES ON THAT.\nIT WILL BE, I WOULD ASSUME, WITHIN THE NEXT 12 TO 24 HOURS\nTHEY WILL HAVE BASICALLY COMPILED EVERY BIT OF DIGITAL\nEVIDENCE POSSIBLE AND TRY TO PUT THAT TOGETHER AND IF THEY CAN\nGET SOMEBODY ARRIING AND AFTER AND -- JUST LIKE THEY DID FOR\nBOSTON AND LIKE THEY HAVECRIMES. YOU CAN'T WALK FIVE FEET WITHOUT\nBEING ON SOMEBODY'S CAMERA. IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME TO\nFIGURE OUT WHAT'S RELEVANT AND WHAT'S NOT.\n>> I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME TO OUR CONVERSATION, JIM CAVANAUGH.\nAS YOU JOIN ME HERE, LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR TAKEAWAY, THE BIGGEST\nTHING YOU TOOK AWAY FROM THE NEWS CONFERENCE.\n>> WELL, I THINK THEY ARE PROBABLY COMING OFF WE DON'T\nTHINK IT'S TERRORISM SHORTLY AND PROBABLY TODAY.\nLET'S LOOK AT FACTS HERE. AL QAEDA'S \"INSPIRE\" MAGAZINE,\nTHE FIRST EDITION, THEY HAD A PRE-EDITION AS WELL, THE FIRST\nEDITION ON PAGE 40 SPECIFICALLY SAYS, YOU MAKE PIPE BOMBS, YOU\nHAVE THREE PIPE BOMBS. THEY HAVE A PHOTOGRAPH.\nYOU EXTERNALLY WIRE THE PIPE BOMBS FOR AFFECT.\nI CAN TELL YOU IN 40 YEARS OF BOMB INVESTIGATION BASICALLY --\nI WAS A DEPUTY OF CHIEF OF EXPLOSIVES.\nI TRAINED A BOMB INVESTIGATORS. I KNEW VIRTUALLY EVERY BOMB IN\nTHE COUNTRY. WE RAN THE BOMB SYSTEMS.\nBOMBS THAT ARE EXTERNALLY FUSED WITH ELECTRIC WIRE, PIPE BOMBS\nLIKE THAT, HAPPEN SOMETIMES. BUT THEY ARE UNUSUAL EVENTS.TEL\nUNUSUALLY DIFFUSED BOMB IN SEASIDE PARK.\nTHE NEXT PARAGRAPH IN THE MAGAZINE SAYSEFFECTIVE\nWAY IS WITH A PRESSURE COOKER. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS --\nCOMMANDERS HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS FORMULA THAT'S LATE OUT IN\n\"INSPIRE\" MAGAZINE. WE HAVE THE BOMB THAT TARGETS\nTHE MARINE RUN. IT SORT OF MALFUNCTIONS.\nONE DEVICE GOES OFF. PROBABLY BLOWS THE OTHER TWO\nLOOSE. THE BOMBER DOES NOT ACHIEVE THE\nGOAL. THE BOMBER OR MORE LIKELY MORE\nTHAN ONE. A COUPLE MAYBE.\nWITHIN 11 HOURS, WE HAVE THESE INCIDENTS IN NEW YORK CITY.\nTHAT'S ONLY A TWO-HOUR DRIVE. ON A SATURDAY, IT'S 80 MILES\nFROM SEASIDE PARK TO CHELSEA. IT'S 80 MILES FOR PEOPLE WHO\nDON'T LIVE IN THE AREA SO THEY UNDERSTAND.\nON A SATURDAY, THERE'S NOT COMMUTER TRAFFIC.\nYOU CAN GET THERE PRETTY QUICK. THIS COULD BE A RELATED ACT.\nIT'S NOT TRUE -- I CAN -- I CAN CITE YOU CHAPTER AND VERSE IN\nCASES THAT I WAS INVOLVED IN THAT BOMBERS ALWAYS MAKE THE\nSAME BOMB. THAT'S NOT THE CASE.\nSOMETIMES THERE'S SIGNATURES THAT RUN THROUGH BOMBS.\nTHAT'S TRUE. I WOULD BE NOT SURPRISED TO SEE\nTHE SAME WIRE, TAPE IN BOTH OF THOSE CASES, NEW YORK AND\nSEASIDE PARK. WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME AT ALL.\nEVEN THE SAME TOOL MARKS. BOMBERS DON'T ALWAYS MAKE THE\nSAME BOMB.  FIVE DIFFERENT BOMBS.\nREMOTELY DETONATED. TIMER DETONATED.\nGASOLINE, DYNAMITE. YOU WOULD SAY THEY'RE NOT THE\nSAME BOMBER AND YET THEY WERE WHEN WE CAUGHT THEM.\nTHAT DOESN'T ALWAYS HOLD TRUE. IF PEOPLE LOOK AT THE PRESSURE\nCOOKER AND SAY THAT'S A PIPE BOMB, THAT'S THE WRONG ANALYSIS.\nTHE ANALYSIS HERE IS THIS FORMULA IS ON PAGE 40 OF\n\"INSPIRE\" MAGAZINE. RIGHT EXACTLY DOWN THE ROAD.\nWHOEVER DID THAT BOMBING IN SEASIDE PARK -- I KNOW THAT\nCOMMUNITY. BEEN THERE MANY TIMES.\nTHERE'S 2200 PEOPLE LIVE THERE. IT'S A SHORE TOWN.\nTHOSE HOUSES ARE EXPENSIVE. THOSE BOMBERS DON'T LIVE THERE.\nTHE BOMBERS DON'T LIVE THERE. THEY WENT THERE.\nTHEY WENT THERE TO TARGET THE MARINE RUN.\nBUT FOR THE RUN WAS DELAYED, WE WOULD HAVE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE\nHURT. BUT FOR THE BOMB MALFUNCTIONED.\nANOTHER THING I WOULD ADD IN MY ANALYSIS -- WE HAVE A LITTLE\nMORE ROOM TO MAKE AN ANALYSIS, BECAUSE WE ARE NOT DIRECTING THE\nCASE. I SALUTE CHIEF O'NEILL AND THE\nFBI ASSISTANCE DIRECTOR AND THE MAYOR.\nTHEY ARE DOING WHAT I HAD TO DO FOR MANY YEARS.\nYOU HAVE TO BE MORE CLOSE CROPPED WHEN YOU ARE THE\nCOMMANDER. WHEN WE'RE AN ANALYST FOR NBC,\nWE CAN TALK WIDER. THAT'S WHAT THE VIEWERS WANT.\nTHEY WANT TO KNOW, WHAT'S YOUR EXPERIENCE TELL YOU?\nHERE ARE SOME BOMBS -- THIS BOMB -- THIS SECOND BOMB AT 27th\nSTREET, IF IT TURNS OUT TO BE A REAL BOMB -- WE HEARD IT BOTH\nWAYS. IF IT TURNS OUT TO BE REAL, THE\nBOMB MALFUNCTIONED. IF IT'S A REAL BOMB, THE BOMB\nMALFUNCTIONED. IT MALFUNCTIONED BECAUSE A\nPERSON WHO IS LEAVING A BOMB IN A CROWDED NEW YORK CITY STREET\nIS NOT LEAVING A BOMB FOR SHOW. IT'S NOT LEAVING A BOMB FOR YOU\nTO FIND IT. IT MALFUNCTIONED.\nTHE BOMB IN NEW JERSEY ALSO MALFUNCTIONED.\nYOU HAVE SOME AMATEUR -- IF THEY ARE CONNECTED.\nIT'S POSSIBLE. I'M NOT SAYING THEY ARE\nDEFINITELY. IT'S POSSIBLE.\nMALFUNCTIONS, ATTEMPTS. YOU MAY HAVE SOME INSPIRED\nACTORS HERE. READING \"INSPIRE\" MAGAZINE, A\nCOUPLE OF BOMBS THAT MALFUNCTIONED.\nTHEY HAVE A LOT OF DESIRE. THEY HAVE A LOT OF EFFORT.\nI WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE THE EXPLOSIVE FILLER MATCH IN\nTHOSE CASES. THEY ARE SO CLOSE IN PROXIMITY,\nIN TIME. THEY ARE OFF THE ONE PAGE 40 OF\nTHE MAGAZINE. WHEN BOMBERS FAIL, THEY KEEP\nGOING. THEY KEEP GOING.\nTHEY PROGRESS. THEY WANT -- THESE ARE -- EVEN\nIF THEY ARE SEPARATE BOMBERS, WHICH IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE,\nTHEY FAILED BOTH TIMES. THEY FAILED TO KILL PEOPLE IN\nNEW JERSEY AND IN NEW YORK. THEIR GOAL IS MURDER.\nTHEY ARE FAILING. >> BUT THEY DID HAVE ONE\nEXPLOSION THAT WAS PRETTY DARN POWERFUL.\nTHEY DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY. BY ALL ACCOUNTS, ALL 29 PEOPLE\nTHAT WERE INJURED ARE OUT OF THE HOSPITAL.\nWE DON'T HAVE ANY REPORT WITH LIFE-THREATENING CONDITIONS.\nI'M SURE THEY WOULD BE IN THE HOSPITAL WERE THAT TO BE THE\nCASE. THEY DID SUCCEED WITH ONE.\n>> WELL, I THINK YOU ARE RIGHT. THEY INJURED SOME PEOPLE.\nBUT THEIR GOAL IS MURDER. MASS MURDER.\nTHEY DIDN'T ACHIEVE THAT. THAT'S THE REAL GOAL.\nTHEY PROBABLY FAILED THERE IN THE PLACEMENT.\nWHEN THEY PUT IT INTO THE TRASH BIN, THAT ACTED AS A TOTAL\nCONTAINMENT VESSEL LIKE THE BOMB SQUAD TOOK AWAY TO ROBIN'S NECK.\nIT ACTED LIKE THAT. THEY THOUGHT IT MIGHT ENHANCE\nTHE BLAST. BECAUSE THE EXPLOSIVE CHARGE WAS\nNOT LARGE ENOUGH, IT MOSTLY CONTAINED THE FRAGMENTATION FROM\nWHATEVER THEIR BOMB CONTAINER WAS.\nOTHERWISE, WE WOULD HAVE HAD PIECES OF THE PRESSURE COOKER,\nIF THAT'S WHAT IT WAS, FLUNG ALL OVER 23rd STREET AND WE WOULD\nHAVE MORE DEVASTATING INJURIES. IT ACTED AS A BOMB CONTAINMENT\nVESSEL. THAT'S PROBABLY THE FAILURE OF\nTHEM WHEN THEY PUT IT IN THERE. THE BOMB ON 27th STREET WAS JUST\nA PLASTIC BAG AND ON THE SIDEWALK.\nIT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE DEVASTATING.\nI BELIEVE THAT PROBABLY MALFUNCTIONED IF IT'S REAL.\n>> JIM AND DON, CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH.\nI THINK JIM YOU PUT IT APTLY THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO BRING YOUR\nEXPERTISE TO OUR BROADCAST AND LET US KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.\nSPECULATION AND IT HELPS GET US THROUGH.\nTHANK YOU VERY MUCH. APPRECIATE THAT.\nWE ARE APPROACHING THE TOP OF THE HOUR.\nSTAY WITH US FOR MORE ON THIS BREAKING NEWEVELOPMENTS HERE\nON MSNBC AT THE TOP OF THE HOUR.",

BUT I WILL SAY THAT THIS DOESN'T\nSEEM TO BE THE KIND OF ATTACK THAT ONE WOULD STAGE IF YOU ARE\nWANTING TO KILL MANY PEOPLE. PUTTING A BOMB IN THE DUMPSTER\nOR PUTTING IT BY WITH THE TIMER BY A AREA IS NOT WHAT WE HAVE\nSEEN WHERE PEOPLE OPEN FIRE WITH ASSAULT RIFLES AND THINGS LIKE THAT.\n>> RICHARD ENGEL JUST HAPPENED TO BE THERE AT THE SCENE.\nAND THAT EXPLOSION AS RICHARD WAS REFERRING TO WAS NOT THE\nONLY EVENT YESTERDAY.

AND SO LET ME START WITH PETE.\nLET ME START WITH THE NEW YORK INCIDENT, AND THE MAYOR BILL De\nBLASIO SAID IT IS NOT CLEAR IT IS A TERROR INCIDENT, BUT WHAT\nDID HE MEAN? IT IS AN INTENTIONAL DEVICE, AND\nWE ARE PARSING THE WORDS. >> YES, WHEN HE WAS SPEAKING, HE\nSAID THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO SAY WHETHER IT IS A\nTERRORIST INCIDENT OR NOT. BUT THERE IS A CONSIDERABLE ALT\nOF LUCK HERE, CHARLES. THE BOMB WENT OFF BEFORE THE\nRACE STARTED AND THE RACE WAS DELAYED AND THATIS LUCK NUMBER\nONE. AND SECONDLY, THE DEVICE IN NEW\nJERSEY WHICH IS THREE PIPE BOMBS TAPED TOGETHER DIDN'T GO OFF\nENTIRELY. AND SO A LOT OF EVIDENCE WAS\nLEFT BEHIND. THAT IS THE SECOND PIECE OF GOOD\nLUCK. AND THE THIRD PIECE OF GOOD\nLUCK, THE PRESSURE COOKER IN NEW YORK ALSO DID NOT GO OFF, SO\nTHERE IS A LOT OF EVIDENCE FOR THE INVESTIGATORS THE LOOK AT,\nAND ONE BIG QUESTION, WHAT IS IN COMMON WITH THE TWO DEVICES, THE\nONE IN NEW JERSEY AND THE ONE IN NEW YORK ASSUMING THEY CAN\nULTIMATE I WILL SEE. >> SO THE INVESTIGATES ARE\nWORKING NEW JERSEY AND NEW YORK AS POTENTIALLY ONE GROUP?\n>> WELL, THEY WANT TO KNOW IF THERE IS A CONNECTION OR SAME\nPERSON OR GROUP, AND BROADLY SPEAKING, SIMILARITIES.\nELECTRONIC TIMERS AND CELL PHONE ON BOTH OF THESE THING, BUT\nTHESE ARE THE INSTRUCTIONS THAT ARE WIDELY AVAILABLE.\nTHE AL QAEDA MAGAZINE \"INSPIRE\" THEY HAVE RUN ARTICLES ON HOW TO\nTHE BUILD SIMILAR DEVICES. SO THEY ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING\nAT THE MICROSCOPICS OF HOW THEY ARE CONNECT AND THAT SORT OF\nTHING. >> AND IN MINNESOTA?\nARE THEY DEFINITELY CONNECTED OR SOME REASON TO THINK?\n>> WELL, THERE IS NO REASON, BUT IT APPEARS TO BE A COINCIDENCE\nOF THE TIMING, AND NOTHING SIMILAR AT ALL.\nTHEY WILL BE LOOKING AT THE MAN'S PAST THAT WAS SHOT AND\nKILLED IN THE MINNESOTA INCIDENT AND LOOKING AT THE RESIDENCE TO\nSEE IF HE WAS INSPIRED BY ISIS PROPAGANDA OR WHATEVER.\n>> AND GOING BACK THE TO NEW YORK CITY, AND MORE CAMERA IN\nNEW YORK CITY THAN ANY CITY IN THE WORLD.\n>> RIGHT. >> I ASSUME THAT THEY HAVE TO --\nTHEY MAY ALREADY THINK THAT THEY HAVE SUSPECTS IN MIND OR THE\nIT APPEARS THAT THE DEVICE THAT WENT OFF WAS DROPPED IN A\nDUMPSTER AND THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE OF NEW YORK AND NEW\nJERSEY, CAMERAS EVERYWHERE IN NEW YORK, AND NOT SO MUCH IN NEW\nJERSEY FINDING THE SURVEILLANCE VIDEO BEFORE, BUT THAT IS A\nPRODUCTIVE LINE OF INQUIRY FOR THEM.\n>> PETE WILLIAMS, I KNOW THAT YOU ARE WORKING THE STORY, AND\nWHEN WE GET MORE, YOU WILL",

WE ARE STANDING BY FOR A NEWS\nCONFERENCE WHERE NEW YORK CITY'S MAYOR AND NEW YORK CITY POLICE\nOFFICIALS WILL UPDATE US ON THE INVESTIGATION INTO LAST NIGHT'S\nEXPLOSION IN MANHATTAN. 29 PEOPLE WERE INJURED IN THE\nBLAST, WHICH NEW YORK MAYOR BILL de BLASIO DESCRIBES AS AN\nINTENTIONAL ACT. POLICE FOUND A SECOND DEVICE, A\nPRESSURE COOKER CONNECTED TO A CELL PHONE JUST BLOCKS AWAY.\nA SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL TELLS CNN INVESTIGATORS\nHAVE NOT YET FOUND ANY GOOD SURVEILLANCE VIDEO FROM EITHER\nLOCATION. GOVERNOR ANDREW CUOMO BRIEFED\nREPORTERS A SHORT TIME AGO. >> AT THIS TIME THERE'S NO\nEVIDENCE OF AN INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM CONNECTION WITH THIS\nINCIDENT. >> CRIME LAB INVESTIGATORS ARE\nCHECKING TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN THE MANHATTAN\nBLAST AND AN EXPLOSION IN NEW JERSEY YESTERDAY.\nSOMEONE THERE IN THE GARDEN STATE PLANTED THREE PIPE BOMBS\nIN A TRASH CAN ALONG THE ROUTE OF A CHARITY MARINE CORPS RACE\nON THE JERSEY SHORE. ONLY ONE OF THE DEVICES\nDETONATED AND FORM NO ONE WAS INJURED, LIKELY BECAUSE A\nDELAYED START IN THE RACE MEANT THE RUNNERS HAD NOT YET GATHERED\nWHEN THE BOMB WENT OFF. THERE'S ALSO SOME BREAKING NEWS\nIN THE INVESTIGATION INTO YESTERDAY'S ATTACK AT A\nMINNESOTA SHOPPING MALL. A STATEMENT POSTED ONLINE TODAY\nBY A MEDIA WING OF ISIS CLAIMS THAT THE ATTACKER WAS, QUOTE, A\nSOLDIER OF THE ISLAMIC STATE. WITNESSES SAY THAT THE MAN ASKED\nAT LEAST ONE OF HIS VICTIMS IF HE OR SHE WERE MUSLIM BEFORE HE\nATTACKED. AN OFF-DUTY OFFICER KILLED THE\nMAN, WHO POLICE SAY WAS KNOWN TO THEM.\nONE OF THE EIGHT PEOPLE WOUNDED IN THE ATTACK REMAINS\nHOSPITALIZED. THE OTHERS HAVE BEEN RELEASED.\nAS WE AWAIT THIS PRESS CONFERENCE FROM THE NYPD AND\nFROM NEW YORK CITY MAYOR BILL de BLASIO LET'S BRING IN JESSICA\nSCHNEIDER. JESSICA, NEW YORK GOVERNOR CUOMO\nJUST TOLD REPORTSER THERE IS FAR THEY DO NOT KNOW OF ANY LINK\nWITH INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. WAS THERE ANY OTHER NEW\nINFORMATION HE SHARED? >> Reporter: YOU KNOW, GOVERNOR\nCUOMO, JAKE, SAID THAT THE PROPERTY DAMAGE AT THE BUILDING\nWHERE THIS EXPLOSION OCCURRED IS SIGNIFICANT.\nTHE EXPLOSION OCCURRING JUST DOWN WEST 23rd STREET NEAR 6th\nAVENUE. THE GOVERNOR SAYING BECAUSE OF\nTHAT SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY DAMAGE, IT'S LUCKY THAT THERE\nWERE NO FATALITIES HERE. THERE WERE, IN FACT, 29 PEOPLE\nINJURED, BUT ALL 29 OF THESE PEOPLE WHO WERE TREATED AT LOCAL\nHOSPITALS HAVE ALL BEEN TREATED AND RELEASED.\nSO NO MAJOR INJURIES. NOW, AS FOR THE INVESTIGATION,\nIT'S PRETTY MUCH TWOFOLD. IT'S FOCUSED ON FORENSICS AND\nSURVEILLANCE. THE EXPLOSIVE DEVICE THAT WENT\nOFF JUST DOWN THE STREET HERE AS WELL AS THAT PRESSURE COOKER\nTHAT WAS FOUND FOUR BLOCKS NORTH OF HERE ON WEST 27th, BOTH OF\nTHOSE AND THE DEBRIS FROM IT HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO FBI LAB.\nTHE FBI LAB DOWN IN QUANTICO, VIRGINIA.\nTHEY'LL BE ANALYZED. BUT GOVERNOR CUOMO SAYING IT\nDOES NOT LOOK LIKE THE DEVICES HERE IN MANHATTAN WERE AT ALL\nCONNECTED TO THE ONES DOWN IN SEASIDE PARK, NEW JERSEY, OR ONE\nOF THOSE PIPE BOMBS THAT WENT OFF BEFORE THE MARINE CORPS\nCHARITY RUN. IN ADDITION, THE INVESTIGATORS\nARE LOOKING AT THE SURVEILLANCE VIDEO.\nTHIS IS A VERY BUSY AREA OF MANHATTAN ON A SATURDAY NIGHT.\nINVESTIGATORS ARE SIFTING THROUGH SOME OF THE SURVEILLANCE\nVIDEO. WE'VE LEARNED THAT THEY HAVE\nSPOTTED AN INDIVIDUAL IN THAT SURVEILLANCE VIDEO WHO WAS IN\nTHE APPROXIMATE LOCATION OF THE VIDEO BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR IF THE\nPERSON IS CONNECTED TO THE EXPLOSION.\nSOME OF THE OTHER VIDEO A BIT GRAINY AND NOT OFFERING A LOT OF\nCLUES AS OF YET AS TO HOW EXACTLY THIS TRANSSPPIRED AND W\nMAY BE RESPONSIBLE. >> I'M JOINED BY CNN JUSTICE\nCORRESPONDENT EVAN PEREZ. EVAN, BAD NEWS ABOUT THE\nSURVEILLANCE VIDEO APPARENTLY RIGHT NOW, BUT I KNOW LAW\nENFORCEMENT IS HOPING THAT THAT SECOND PRESSURE COOKER MIGHT\nPROVIDE SOME CLUES. WHAT ARE YOUR SOURCES TELLING\nYOU? >> THAT'S RIGHT.\nI THINK THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT TO WORK WITH, JAKE.\nONE OF THE THINGS THAT, FRANKLY, IS LUCKY HERE, THERE'S NO DEATHS\nTHAT HAVE RESULTED FROM THIS, BUT THE DEVICE THAT WAS\nRECOVERED IS ON ITS WAY TO QUANTICO WHERE THEY WILL BE ABLE\nTO RECOVER A LOT OF INFORMATION, NOT ONLY PERHAPS WHERE THE\nPRESSURE COOKER WAS BOUGHT, WHICH IS ONE WAY YOU CAN MAYBE\nTRACE TO SEE WHO MIGHT HAVE BOUGHT THIS AND MIGHT HAVE HAD\nSOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS, BUT ALSO IF THAT HE IS ANY DNA THAT\nWAS LEFT BEHIND BY THE BOMBMAKER.\nTHE STATEMENT SING W-- SAME THIH THE ONE IN SEASIDE PARK.\nONE DEVICE WENT OFF, TWO DID NOT.\nTHE MAKEUP IS BEING LOOKED AT BY THE FBI.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MINNESOTA ATTACK BECAUSE ISIS'\nMEDIA ARM CLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY SAYING THAT THIS\nINDIVIDUAL WAS A SOLDIER OF THE ISLAMIC STATE, WAS AN ISIS\nTERRORIST. WHAT MORE DO WE KNOW ABOUT THIS?\n>> WELL, I THINK WHAT THE FBI HAS AT THIS POINT IS THERE'S NO\nREASON TO DOUBT WHAT THE ISIS MEDIA PEOPLE SAY, AND THE\nLANGUAGE THEY USE, WHICH IS A SOLDIER OF THE ISLAMIC STATE, IS\nTHE TYPICAL LANGUAGE THEY USE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE INSPIRED.\nIN OTHER WORDS, THEY'RE NOT DIRECTED.\nTHIS IS THE LANGUAGE THEY USE WHEN THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO MAY\nHAVE SENT SOME KIND OF MESSAGE RIGHT BEFORE THEY CARRIED OUT\nTHEIR ATTACK. THEY MIGHT HAVE POSTED SOMETHING\nSOMEWHERE SAYING I'M DOING THIS IN THE NAME OF AND THEN THEY GO\nOUT AND DO THEIR THING. IT APPEARS TO BE THAT WOULD BE\nTHE CASE. AGAIN, THERE'S TONS OF THESE\nPEOPLE OUT THERE WHO COULD BE INSPIRED TO ACT WITHOUT ANYONE\nKNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT IT BEFORE HAND.\n>> IT SEEMS HARD TO BELIEVE ALL THREE INCIDENTS HAPPENING ON THE\nSAME DAY WOULD BE JUST A COINCIDENCE.\n>> RIGHT, EXACTLY. THIS IS WHAT ISIS HAS BEEN\nFRANKLY PRODDING ITS MEMBERS TO DO OR ITS SUPPORTERS TO DO.\nIF YOU'RE IN THE WEST, ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THEY'RE\nLOSING TERRITORY AND IT'S HARDER FOR THEM TO -- FOR THEIR\nRECRUITS TO GET THERE. ALMOST WEEKLY YOU SEE THOSE\nMESSAGES OUT THERE. THIS IS WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING\nFOR. THEY SEE ONE THING GO OFF, IT'S\nALMOST LIKE A CALL FOR THEM TO GO OUT AND DO SOMETHING AT THE\nSAME TIME. >> INTERESTING.\nMAYBE THE FIRST ONE CREATED A TEMPTATION --\n>> VERY MUCH THE MODUS OPERANDI. >> LET'S BRING IN OUR EXPERTS\nRIGHT NOW. WE HAVE WITH US JULIETTE KAYYEM,\nA FORMER ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND\nSECURITY. ALSO TOM FUENTES, A CNN NATIONAL\nSECURITY ANALYST AND FORMER FBI ASSISTANT DIRECTOR.\nWE ALSO HAVE WITH US FORMER CIA OPERATIVE BOB BAER WHO WAS WITH\nTHE CIA AND IS A CNN INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY\nANALYST. BOB, LET ME JUST START WITH YOU.\nDO YOU THINK, I MEAN, WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING, BUT IS IT LIKELY\nTHAT THESE THREE INCIDENT ALL HAPPENING THE SAME DAY WOULD BE\nRELATED EVEN IF JUST THE FIRST ONE INSPIRED THE OTHER TWO TO\nACT? >> WELL, JAKE, IT'S A LITTLE TOO\nMANY COINCIDENCES FOR ME. I MEAN, YOU HAVE NEW JERSEY\nLATER THAT NIGHT, NEW YORK, TWO BOMBS, AND THEN MINNESOTA.\nTHERE COULD BE SOME CALL OUT THERE BY THE ISLAMIC STATE, BUT\nIN THE NEW YORK BOMBING, THE PRESSURE COOKER, THERE'S BEEN NO\nCLAIM. THESE THINGSHE'SY TO MAKE.\nIT COULD BE ANYTHING FROM A PSYCHOPATH TO A DOMESTIC GROUP.\nTHE IMPORTANT THING IS TO CHECK THE WIRING, AND THAT WILL TELL\nUS A LOT. IT WILL LINK US TO THE BOSTON\nBOMBINGS IN 2013 OR MAYBE NOT. SO WE REALLY HAVE TO WAIT FOR\nTHE FORENSICS WHETHER YOU CAN EVEN BEGIN TO CALL THIS\nINTERNATIONAL TERRORISM OR SOMETHING DOMESTIC.\n>> AND JULIETTE KAYYEM, EVAN PEREZ SAYING ISIS USING THE\nLANGUAGE, A SOLDIER OF THE ISLAMIC STATE, SUGGESTS THAT\nTHIS INDIVIDUAL WHO CARRIED OUT THESE HORRIFIC STAPINGS IN\nMINNESOTA YESTERDAY WAS INSPIRED BY ISIS BUT NOT NECESSARILY\nTRAINED OR SENT BY ISIS. >> RIGHT.\nAND THAT'S THE MORE TYPICAL SORT OF INCIDENT THESE DAYS.\nACTUALLY, WE TEND TO TALK ABOUT ISIS DIRECTED AND ISIS INSPIRED.\nWE ACTUALLY ARE BEGINNING TO SEE A THIRD WAVE.\nI CALL IT ISIS JUSTIFIED. PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO CONNECT WITH\nISIS BUT AT THE LAST MOMENT SAY I'M A MEMBER OF ISIS OR, YOU\nKNOW, I SUPPORT ISIS AND THEN DO SOMETHING VIOLENT AND ATTACK.\nI HAVE TO SAY BECAUSE MINNESOTA SAID THIS GUY WAS ON SOME SORT\nOF RADAR SCREEN, THEY WERE POSSIBLY MONITORING HIM AS\nPOTENTIALLY ISIS INSPIRED BUT NO EVIDENCE OF ISIS DIRECTED, THIS\nIS THE COMMON SORT OF M.O. OF BOTH ISIS BUT THOSE WHO ARE\nFOLLOWING THEM ONLINE AND THEN DO, YOU KNOW, SERIOUS INJURY TO\nOTHERS. >> AND TOM FUENTES, AS A FORMER\nFBI TOP OFFICIAL, TELL US WHAT YOU THINK IS GOING ON RIGHT\nTHERE, RIGHT NOW AT THE FBI IN TERMS OF THEIR CONCERN.\nTHREE ATTACKS. THANKFULLY AS OF NOW NO\nFATALITIES OF INNOCENT PEOPLE, BUT THIS HAS GOT TO BE A\nCONCERN. >> IT IS, JAKE.\nAND BESIDES THE REGULAR INVESTIGATION, THE FORENSICS AND\nTHE DEVICE THAT IS WILL BE CONDUCTED AT QUANTICO, THE OTHER\nEXAMINATION IS GOING TO BE EXTENSIVE ON SOCIAL MEDIA.\nDID A CALL GO OUT? PAUL CRUICKSHANK CNN TERRORISM\nANALYST REMINDED ME THAT YESTERDAY WAS THE ANNIVERSARY OF\nTHE SIGNING OF THE U.S. CONSTITUTION.\nMAYBE THERE'S MESSAGES THAT WENT OUT BY ISIS CALLING FOR AN\nATTACK YESTERDAY OF ANYBODY OUGHT THERE THAT WAS LISTENING.\nIT'S POSSIBLE THAT'S THE COINC\nCOINCIDENCE. EVEN IF IT'S NOT THE SAME\nINDIVIDUAL OR GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS, THEY WERE LED TO DO\nTHESE ATTACKS ON THE SAME DAY. >> BOB, WHAT IS THE LIKELIHOOD\nDO YOU THINK THAT THERE IS EVIDENCE ON ANY OF THE THREE\nREMAINING DEVICES THAT DID NOT GO OFF.\nTHE TWO IN NEW JERSEY, THE ONE IN NEW YORK, THAT WOULD ALLOW\nCOUNTER TRIRMOS TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHO DID THIS EVEN\nWITHOUT ANY DEFEND SURVEILLANCE VIDEO?\n>> OH, JAKE, I THINK SO FOR SURE.\nONCE IT'S IN THE HANDS OF THE FBI, THEIR EXPERTS, THEY KNOW\nWHAT THEY'RE DOING. THEY WILL BE ABLE TO TELL US\nWHETHER IT'S TAKEN OFF THE INTERNET OR IF THERE'S A\nSIGNATURE THAT SUGGESTS A GROUP. I THINK WE'LL GET OUR BEST\nINFORMATION FROM THAT ANALYSIS AND, YOU KNOW, CONNECTED\nANYWHERE ELSE FROM, YOU KNOW, PRESSURE COOKERS IN STOCKHOLM TO\nPARIS AND THE REST OF THEM, WHAT BOMBS DIDN'T GO OFF.\nTHIS IS GOING TO BE KEY IN THE INVESTIGATION.\n>> AND WHAT, JULIETTE, CAN BE DONE IF THESE THREE INCIDENT\nWERE ALL INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE ISIS INSPIRED?\nTHAT IS TO SAY, INDIVIDUALS THAT HAD NEVER REALLY COMMUNICATED\nWITH ANY TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS, INDIVIDUALS WHO\nHAD NEVER TRAVELED ABROAD. IF THEY ARE JUST HOME GROWN\nTERRORISTS ACTING ALONE TAKING INFORMATION OFF THE INTERNET,\nWHAT MORE CAN BE DONE TO PREVENT THAT TYPE OF ATTACK?\n>> THAT'S THE CHALLENGE THAT WE ARE CONFRONTING OVERALL NOT JUST\nIN WHAT HAPPENED IN THE LAST 24 HOURS.\nSO THERE'S TWO PIECES TO IT. ONE IS IN ALMOST ALL THESE CASES\nSOMEONE KNOWS. SO THIS IS WHAT WE CALL\nENCOUNTERING VIOLENT EXTREMISM, WORKING WITH COMMUNITIES THAT\nMAY KNOW THESE INDIVIDUALS AND HAVING THEM FEEL COMFORTABLE\nCOMING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER PIECE\nWHICH IS JUST ACCESS TO BOMBMAKING MATERIAL, GUNS,\nWHATEVER IS BEING USED BY THOSE WHO ARE PERFORMING THIS KIND OF\nVIOLENCE. YOU WANT TO GET THE IDEOLOGY AND\nTHE MEANS SIMULTANEOUSLY. BUT AS YOU KNOW, NO SECURITY\nAPPARATUS, I CAN'T SAY THIS ENOUGH, NO SECURITY APPARATUS IS\nGOING TO BE ABLE TO STOP THE NEXT 22-YEAR-OLD GUY OR WHOEVER\nIT IS GETTING RADICALIZED, GETTING WEAPONS, AND GOING TO\nANY NUMBER OF SOFT TARGETS. LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN\nCHELSEA AND A SUBURBAN SHOPPING MALL IN MINNESOTA.\nSO THAT'S THE CHALLENGE THAT WE CONFRONT OVERALL.\nAND I HAVE TO SAY AGAIN WE DON'T KNOW WHAT EACH OF THESE\nINCIDENTS ARE OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS.\n>> AND TOM FUENTES, THE PRESSURE COOKER BOMBS THAT WERE BUILT TO\nKILL THE THREE INNOCENT PEOPLE AT THE BOSTON MARATHON BOMB M\nBOMBING IN 2013, THE INSTRUCTIONS WERE SAID TO HAVE\nCOME FROM ONE OF THE ISIS AFFILIATED PUBLICATIONS ONLINE.\n>> AL QAEDA. >> AL QAEDA?\n>> \"INSPIRE\" MAGAZINE, AN ARTICLE THEY PUT OUT CALLED\nMAKING A BOMB IN THE KITCHEN OF YOUR MOM.\n>> THAT'S THE ONE THE TSARNAEV BROTHERS USED?\n>> YES. THAT'S BEFORE ISIS EVEN EXISTED.\n>> THE QUESTION I WANT TO ASK THOUGH IS WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT\nTHAT KIND OF INFORMATION OUT THERE ON THE INTERNET?\nOBVIOUSLY YOU CAN'T TAKE IT DOWN.\nIT JUST WILL POP UP SOMEWHERE ELSE.\n>> NO. >> IS COUNTERTERRORISM, IS LAW\nENFORCEMENT MONITORING WHO IS LOOKING AT IT?\nARE THEY WATCHING PEOPLE ALONG THOSE LINES OR DO YOU NEED TO\nGET A SPECIAL WARRANT FOR THAT SORT OF THING?\n>> WELL, THERE'S TENS OF THOUSANDS OF THESE MESSAGES\nGOING OUT EVERY DAY FROM ISIS AND BEFORE THAT A CERTAIN AMOUNT\nFROM AL QAEDA. IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO\nMONITOR WHO IS ON THE RECEIVING END OF ALL OF THAT.\nWHO HAS INTERNET ACCESS OR ACCESS TO MAGAZINES THAT ARE\nSTILL AVAILABLE EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE MADE BY AL AWLAKI IN YEMEN.\nTHEY'RE STILL OUT THERE AND GOING TO BE OUT THERE.\nIT'S HARD AND VERY HARD FOR THE BUREAU TO READ THE MIND WHO IS\nLOOKING AT THAT AND DECIDING TO PUT A DEVICE LIKE THAT TOGETHER.\nTHIS IS NOT A NUCLEAR WEAPON. THESE ARE READILY AVAILABLE\nCOMPONENTS YOU CAN GET IN AN APPLIANCE STORE.\nYOU CAN ORDER EVERYTHING. >> Narrator: L-- ONLINE EXCEPT\nTHE BLACK POWDER AND THAT'S READILY AVAILABLE AS WELL.\nEVERYTHING THAT'S NEEDED A READILY AVAILABLE OR LES EYE\nMANUFACTURED. >> AND THAT'S WHY THIS BECOMES\nMORE OF AN INTELLIGENCE CHALLENGE THAN A LAW ENFORCEMENT\nCHALLENGE BECAUSE YOU CANNOT BAN THE SALE OF PRESSURE COOKERS AND\nMANY COMMON CHEMICALS. >> YEAH, JAKE, EXACTLY.\nBUT ALSO YOU DON'T NEED A WHOLE LOT OF TRAINING IN MAKING ONE OF\nTHESE THINGS. THEY'RE VERY EASY.\nTHEY'RE BASED ON ENERGY BUILDUP INSIDE THE PRESSURE COOKER.\nBLACK POWDER, FLASH POWDER, IT DOESN'T MATTER.\nEASY TO GET. THE DETONATOR IS EASY TO MAKE.\nTHE CELL TELEPHONE CONNECTION IS EASY.\nTHE ONLY GOOD NEWS ABOUT THESE BOMBS IS THE KILL RADIUS IS SO\nSMALL THAT",

WE'RE WAITING FOR A LIVE PRESSER\nTO TAKE PLACE ON THE STABBING SDWINT AND OF COURSE WE'LL BRING\nTHAT TO YOU. THERE ARE THE LIVE PICTURES AT\nST. CLOUD. WHEN IT HAPPENS, WE'LL TAKE YOU\nTHERE. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT ALL OF THIS\nWITH OUR PANEL OF EXPERTS. MATTHEW HORACE FORMER ATF\nEFFECTIVE, ART RODERICK AND RETIRED U.S. MARSHAL, TOM\nFUENTES AND FORMER FBI ASSISTANT DIRECTOR, AND JULIET CAYENNE.\nGOOD TO SEE ALL OF YOU. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MINNESOTA\nCASE FIRST. WE'RE STILL AWAITING THE PRESS\nCONFERENCE OUT OF SAINT CLOUD, THE SHOPPING MALL TERRORIZED BY\nTHE SUSPECT WHO WAS WEARING A PRIVATE SECURITY FIRM UNIFORM\nSAY POLICE. AND STABBED UPWARDS OF NINE\nPEOPLE BEFORE AN OFF DUTY POLICE OFFICER SHOT AND KILLED HIM.\nSO I ONE EWONDER, MATTHEW, HOW THEY GO ABOUT DETERMINING\nWHEREIN DEED HE IS A SOLDIER OF ISIS AS ISIS HAS CLAIMED THIS\nSUSPECT TO BE? HOW DO THEY GO ABOUT DETERMINING\nWHETHER HE WAS ON A MISSION ORDERED BY ISIS?\n>> AS YOU KNOW, EARLY ON IN INVESTIGATIONS, INFORMATION IS\nCOMING IN FAST AND FURIOUSLY. AND AS THINGS EVOLVE, THINGS\nCHANGE HAVERY QUICKLY. FBI WILL BE CHECKING SOCIAL\nMEDIA, SPEAKING TO HIS FAMILY, TRYING TO DETERMINE IF HE'S A\nSYMPATHIZER, SUPPORTER OR MAYBE NOT INVOLVED AT ALL.\nSO EARLY INDICATION SOMETIMES CHANGE.\nTHEY WILL DETERMINE IT OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS.\n>> AND FROM WHAT WE UNDERSTAND IN OUR REPORTING, HE WENT TO\nVARIOUS SECTIONS OF THE SHOPPING MALL AND STABBED PEOPLE BEFORE\nTHIS OFF DUTY OFFICER THEN SHOT AND KILLED HIM.\nWHAT MORE WILL INVESTIGATORS BE TRYING TO COMB THROUGH, WHAT\nKIND OF INFORMATION WOULD THEY BE ABLE TO ASCERTAIN FROM THAT\nSHOPPING MALL, THE SCENE OF THE CRIME?\n>> A LOT LESS THAN I THINK WHAT WILL BE AT HIS HOME.\nSO -- BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO GET THE ISIS CONNECTION.\nICE HAS CLAIMED CREDIT THAT THEY INSPIRED HIM, SO IT WILL BE\nSOCIAL MEDIA, WHO HE HAS TALKED TO, EITHER OPEN SOURCE OR BACK\nSOURCE INFORMATION. THE ATTACK ITSELF IS NOT\nSOPHIS SOPHISTICATED.\nA KNIFE IN A SHOPPING MALL, YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET\nTARGETS. AND I THINK THAT IT'S JUST A\nREMINDER TO ALL OF US, WHETHER THESE ISSUES -- WHETHER THESE\nATTACKS ARE RELATED OR NOT OVER THE COURSE OF 24 HOUR, THEY HAVE\nA COMMONALTY WHICH IS OUR HOMELAND SECURITY APPA RAT\nTUESDAY IS LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS.\nAND EMERGENCY MANAGERS AND PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS.\nTHERE IS NO COUNTERTERRORISM OR HOMELAND SECURITY GROUP OUT\nTHERE WAITING FOR SOMETHING BAD  ITS 'S FIRST RESPONDERS IN PLAC\nTHAT WE'VE NEVER HEARD OF. >> AND TOM, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO\nHEAR OUT OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE?\n>> I THINK I'D LIKE TO HEAR THAT THEY HAVE SPECIFIC INFORMATION\nABOUT WHETHER OR NOT HE WAS TIED TO OTHER INDIVIDUALS, EITHER BY\nCOMMUNICATION OR SOCIAL MEDIA AS JULIET MENTIONED.\nAND JUST SEE. IS HE A LOAN NE WOLF AND TRY TO\nFIGURE OUT IF THERE IS ANYWAY TO DETERMINE YET HOW LONG THE\nRADICALIZATION PERIOD WAS IF IN FACT HE'S RADICALIZED.\nAND AT THIS POINT THEY MAY NOT FULLY KNOW ALL THIS INFORMATION\nYET. BUT THOSE ARE AMONG THE\nQUESTIONS ESPECIALLY IS HE TRULY A LONE WOLF.\nAND IF HE IS, THEN THERE MAY NOT BE A CONTINUING THREAT.\nIF HE ISN'T, THEN IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THERE ARE OTHERS OUT\nTHERE WHO HE MAY IS BEEN IN COMMUNICATION WITH OR SEPARATELY\nMAY HAVE BEEN PLANNING EVENTS LIKE THIS.\n>> AND WHILE NO ONE IS LINKING ALL OF THESE INCIDENTS THAT HAVE\nTAKEN PLACE IN THIS WEEKEND, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MINNESOTA,\nNEW JERSEY WITH THE DEVICES FOUND THERE AND THEN IN THE\nCHELSEA SECTION OF LOWER MANHATTAN, HOW DO YOU SEE THIS\nAS PURELY COINCIDENTAL OR DO YOU BELIEVE IN SOME WAY THERE A\nCOMMON THREAD OR CONNECTION WITH THESE INCIDENTS?\n>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, IF YOU TAKE A STEP BACK AND LOOK AT\nTHIS, NUMBER ONE, LAW ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATORS COME\nNOT BELIEVE IN COINCIDENCES. SO THAT NUMBER ONE TO ME.\nWHAT STRUCK ME, TWO MASS CASUALTY EVENTS, THIRD ONE COULD\nHAVE BEEN IF THE RACE HAD GONE OFF ON TIME.\nAND BY THE GRACE OF GOD, WE HAVE AN OFF DUTY POLICE OFFICER THAT\nWAS ABLE TO STOP THE FIRST MASS CASUALTY EVENT.\nYOU HAVE THIS BOMB GOING OFF IN NEW YORK CITY, LUCKILY NOBODY\nWAS KILLED. SO WE DONED A LOT OF BULLETS\nHERE. AND IN THAT TO ME WHEN HE TAKE A\nSTEP BA STEP BACK YOU HAVE THE INCIDENT\nIN MINNESOTA, SIMILAR TO SOME OF THE ATTACKS THAT HAVE OCCURRED\nIN ISRAEL IN TERMS OF STABBINGS. YOU HAVE HIM ASKING INDIVIDUALS\nARE YOU MUSLIM. YOU HAVE THE ATTACKS GOING ON,\nPOSSIBLE ATTACK IN NEW JERSEY. AND WHAT HAPPENED IN NEW YORK.\nMAYBE NOT GREDIRECTLY, BUT WHY THEY OCCUR WITHIN 24 HOURS, WAS\nTHERE A CALL OUT BY ISIS? IS IT LONE WOLF?\nYOU PUT ALL IT TOGETHER, THERE IS JUST NO -- TO ME, NO\nCOINCIDENCE THAT THESE THREE EF\nEVENTS OCCURRED IN A 24 HOUR TIME PERIOD.\n>> ALL RIGHT, WE HAVE NEW INFORMATION THAT NOW AN\nINVESTIGATION IS UNDER WAY TO PERHAPS HELP SUBSTANTIATE\nWHETHER THERE IS INDEED A CONNECTION BETWEEN WHAT HAPPENED\nIN NEW JERSEY, THE DEVICES FOUND DURING THAT 5 K MARINE CORPS RUN\nAND WHAT HAPPENED IN LOWER MANHATTAN IN CHELSEA.\n>> THAT'S RIGHT. THEY HAVE FOUND SOME\nSIMILARITIES IN THE CELLPHONES THAT WERE USED TO PERHAPS\nDETONATE THE DEVICES. SO THAT'S WHAT INVESTIGATORS ARE\nBE LOOKING AT, FOR SOME CLUES. THERE IS NOTHING TO SAY THAT THE\nINCIDENTS IN NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY ARE DIRECTLY LINKED, BUT\nDEFINITELY THEY ARE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE SIMILARITIES.\nOTHER THAN THAT, THERE ARE NO SIMILARITIES.\n>> SO EVEN THOUGH INITIALLY THESE WERE DETERMINED THAT THERE\nWERE PIPE BOMB, AT LEAST ONE PIPE BOMB IN NEW JERSEY IN THE\nSEASIDE PACK AREA, VERSUS PRESSURE COOKERS, OR AT LEAST\nONE INTACT PRESSURE COOKER IN CHE\nCHELSEA? >> RIGHT.\nTHEY BELIEVE THERE WAS AT LEAST ONE PRESSURE COOKER WHICH THEY\nFOUND ON 27th STREET. THE DEVICES THAT THEY FOUND IN\nNEW JERSEY ARE PIPE BOMBS. SO, YES, THAT'S A DIFFERENCE.\nTHAT IS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE.\nBUT WHAT WAS USED TO DETONATE THE PIPE BOMB THEY BELIEVE WAS A\nCELLPHONE WITH LIKE A SORT OF -- WHICH WAS BEING USED AS A TIMER\nTO SORT OF DETONATE IT. SO PERHAPS MAYBE LIKE THE ALARM\nWAS USED ON THE PHONE SET TO A CERTAIN TIME, AND THEN IT WOULD\nHAVE CAUSED THE EXPLOSION.",

CLOUD,\nMINNESOTA, WHERE AUTHORITIES ARE TALKING ABOUT NOW A DEAD\nSUSPECT, SOMEONE WHO UNLEASHED TERROR IN A SHOPPING MALL,\nSTABBING NINE PEOPLE BEFORE BEING TAKEN OUT BY AN OFF DUTY\nPOLICE OFFICER AND OF COURSE O, INVESTIGATIONS GOING ON IN THE\nCHELSEA COMMUNITY OF NEW YORK CITY WHERE A A EXPLOSIVE DEVICE\nWENT OFF INJURYING 29 PEOPLE AND THEN AN UNEXPLODED PRESSURE\nCOOKER LOCATED JUST BLOCKS AWAY AND THEN A THIRD START WORY WE'\nFOLLOW NG NEW JERSEY, WHICH IS A DEVICES THAT WERE LOCATED THERE\nON THE WEEKEND OF WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A 5K RUN.\nLET'S TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS FIRST TO ST. CLOUD.\nNICK IS VOL FOL LOWING THAT. AND NICK, IT WAS CLEAR THAT\nINVESTIGATORS WANTED TO SPEND LESS TIME ON THE SUSPECT AND\nMORE ON THE HEROICS OF THE OFF DUTY POLICE OFFICER.\nWOINT REVEAL THE IDENTITY OF THE SUSPECT, BUT HE HAS BEEN TAKEN\nOUT. >> WE'VE REACHED OUT TO MR.\nFAULKNER TO GET COMMENT, BUT HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO GET IN TOUCH\nWITH HIM, BUT PHENOMENAL DETAILS PROVIDED THAT MR. FAULKNER, THIS\nOFFICER WHO WAS OFF DUTY BUT AT MALL, ENGAGING THIS SUSPECT,\nSHOOTING HIM MULTIPLE TIMES. GETTING UP THREE TIMES BEFORE\nBEING SHOT DEAD. THIS SUSPECT NOW, THE ONLINE\nMEDIA WING OF ISIS CALLED -- HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY.\nSO FAR CNN HAS BEEN UNABLE TO AWE AUTHENTICATE THIS CLAIM, BUT\nIT FOLLOWS A -- CLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR INDIVIDUALS\nINSPIRED BY ISIS. JUST A SHORT TIME AGO, THE\nSPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE THERE, RICK THORNTON, SAYING THIS ACT\nIS BEING INVESTIGATED AS A POTENTIAL ACT OF TERRORISM.\nHOWEVER, THEY ARE UNSURE IF THIS SUSPECT HAD ANY COMMUNICATION\nWITH THE TERROR GROUP. THEY DID MENTION THEY'VE\nEXECUTED AT LEAST TWO SEARCH WARRANTS AT ONE RESIDENTS OF\nTHIS INDIVIDUAL. HIS CAR ALSO FOUND IN THE\nPARKING LOT IMPOUNDED. THERE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE A\nTHREAT TO THE COMMUNITY THERE, BUT THEY DID MENTION WILLIAM\nANDERSON, THE LOCAL POLICE CHIEF THERE, AN IRONY THAT THIS\nHAPPENED ON THE SAME DAY OF EXPLOSIONS IN NEW YORK AS WELL\nAS NEW JERSEY, WE KNOW FROM OUR SHIMONE, THAT VEST GARRETTS ARE\nLOOKING AT CLUES THERE IN NEW JERSEY AND NEW YORK FOR\nSIMILARITIES, PERHAPS IF THERE'S ANY COINCIDENCES.\nALSO BROUGHT UP AT THIS PRESS CONFERENCE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY\nCONNECTION ON WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY ON WHAT TURNED OUT TO\nBE HORRIFIC TRAGIC NIGHT THAT COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT WORSE.\n>> KEEP US POSTED ON THE INVESTIGATION IN ST. CLOUD,\nMINNESOTA. LET'S TALK ABOUT NOW, WHAT CNN\nIS REPORTING AS SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THESE EXPLOSIONS ON THE\nLEFT, YOU'RE SEEING IN CHELSEA, THIS IS THE DUMPSTER AT WEST\n23rd AND 6th AVENUE. IT CAUSED SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE\nTHERE AND INJURED 29 PEOPLE. ALL OF WHOM HAVE BEEN RELEASED\nFROM THE HOSPITAL. THEN TO YOUR RIGHT, YOU'RE\nSEEING THE REMNANTS, THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY ANOTHER EXPLOSIVE\nDEVICE IN SEASIDE, NEW JERSEY, OVER THE WEEKEND.\nABOUT THE TIME WHEN A 5K RUN WAS SUPPOSED TO TAKE PLACE THERE.\nI'VE GOT THE PANEL BACK WITH ME. YOU'VE SEEN THEM ALL AFTERNOON\nLONG. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THROUGH YOUR\nSOURCES, THAT YOU'RE LEARNING THERE ARE SIMILARITIES\nINVESTIGATORS ARE LOOKING AT BETWEEN WHAT HAPPENED IN ENERGY\nAND IN NEW YORK. >> RIGHT.\nLET'S GO THROUGH THOSE. FIRST OF ALL, THE CELL PHONE,\nWHICH WAS THE DETONATOR USED IN THE DEVICES IN NEW JERSEY.\nTHREE OF THEM. ONLY ONE WENT OFF.\nIT WAS AN OLDER MODEL TYPE CELL PHONE AND WE'RE TOLD IT'S A VERY\nSIMILAR TYPE OF BRAND OF CELL PHONE.\nWAS ALSO FOUND IN THE TWO INCIDENTS IN NEW YORK.\nTHE BOMB THAT DID GO OFF ON 23rd STREET, AS WELL AS THE PRESSURE\nCOOKER DEVICE FOUND ON 27th STREET.\nWE KNOW THAT THE AUTHORITIES HAVE ESTABLISH THAT HAD THE 27th\nSTREET DEVICE DID NOT EXPLODE. THE ONE FOUND ON THE STREET WAS\nA DEVICE THAT COULD HAVE KILLED PEOPLE.\nIT WAS A REAL BOK. IT WAS SOMETHING STILL UP IN THE\nAIR LAST NIGHT. SO, WE KNOW THAT THESE DEVICES,\nTHE TYPE OF DETONATOR WAS USING A CELL PHONE AS SOME TYPE OF AN\nALARM R OR A TIMING DEVICE, SO THERE WASN'T ANY PHONE CALL TO\nDETONATE. THIS WASN'T SET OFF BY MAKING A\nPHONE CALL AS PERHAPS SOME MIGHT ASSUME.\nIF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A CELL PHONE INSTEAD, IT WAS SIMPLY A\nTIMING DEVICE. THERE'S RECIPES THAT HAVE THIS\nTYPE OF DEVICE, WE'VE LEARNED FROM TALKING TO SOURCES THAT THE\nFOUND O USE OF BLACK POWDER. THAT'S A VERY COMMON INGREDIENT.\nYOU CAN BUY AT ANY HARD WEAR STORE, AT WALL MRT, AROUND THE\nCOUNTRY. A VERY COMMON TYPE OF EXPLOSIVE\nDEVICE THAT YOU CAN USE, MAKE AT HOME.\nCLEARLY, THERE WAS SOME EXPERTISE HERE.\nBECAUSE A COUPLE OF THESE WERE ABLE TO GO OFF AND HURT PEOPLE\nIN NEW YORK, BUT SOME DID NOT GO OFF.\nSO PERHAPS WHOEVER WAS BEHIND THIS, IF THERE WERE MULTIPLE\nPEOPLE HERE BEHIND THESE THINGS, THERE WERE SOME JUST LIMITED\nEXPERTISE IN PUTTING THEM TOGETHER.\n>> AND WHILE THERE ARE SIMILARITIES UNDERSCORED BY THE\nCELL PHONES, THERE ARE GREAT DIFFERENCE IN THESE DEVICES, BUT\nHOW MIGHT THAT FURTHER COMPLICATE THINGS FOR\nINVESTIGATOR SNS. >> WELL, I THINK WHAT'S, IT\nCO COMPLICATES THEM BECAUSE THEY\nCAN'T FIND A DIRECTION LINK. NO ONE HAS TOLD US THERE'S\nDIRECT LINK. CERTAINLY, IT'S RAISED SOME\nSUSPICIOUS AMONG INVESTIGATORS, WHY WOULD YOU HAVE A SIMILAR\nPHONE ON THESE THREE DEVICES. SO THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE FOCUSING\nON RIGHT NOW. THE MATERIAL IN THE BOMBS ON\n23rd STREET AND 27th STREET. DOESN'T NECESSARILY MATCH WHAT'S\nIN NEW JERSEY, SO THAT'S DIFFERENT.\nTHE CELL PHONE IS THE KEY. THAT'S ABOUT THE ONLY THING THAT\nLINKS THESE DEVICES. RIGHT NOW, THEY'RE GOING TO RUN\nTHROUGH SYSTEMS NOW TO FIND OUT WHERE SOME OF THIS MATERIAL WAS\nPURCHASED. THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON NOW.\n>> DO YOU SEE SIGNIFICANCE IN THESE SIMILARITIES AND\nDIFFERENCE? NEW JERSEY AND NEW YORK?\nSFWL TO ME, THE DIFFERENCE MEANS TL MAYBE MORE THAN ONE\nINDIVIDUAL THAT CREATES A MORE SCARIER SCENARIO, BUT I THINK\nFROM AN INVESTIGATE, PURELY AN INVESTIGATIVE STANDPOINT, YOU\nHAVE TO ASSUME THERE'S SOME CONNECTION AND LAW ENFORCEMENT\nWILL GATHER EVIDENCE TO SHOW THERE'S NOT A CONNECTION BUT\nTHAT THERE IS A CONNECTION. IF YOU DO IT THE OTHER WAY\nAROUND AND LOOK AT THESE TWO INCIDENTS IN A VACUUM, YOU COULD\nMISS SOME INFORMATION HERE, SO YOU'VE GOT THE JTTF IN NEW YORK\nCITY. THE JTTF IN NEW JERSEY WORKING\nTOGETHER AND I BELIEVE THEY'RE COORDINATING WITH THE JTTF IN\nMINNESOTA TO SEE IF THERE'S A CONNECTION.\n>> WOER GOING CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION.\nGOING TO TAKE A SHORT BREAK. WE'LL BE BACK WITH COVERAGE.",

ISIS NOW CLAIMING THE AIT CAN\nWAS CARRIED OUT BY A QUOTE SOLDIER OF THE ISLAMIC STATE.\nTHE SUSPECT WAS SHOT DEAD BY AN OFF DUTY POLICE OFFICER AND\nPOLICE NOW SAYING THEY HAVE FOUND SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE\nDEVICE THAT EXPLODE D IN NEW YOK CITY LAST NIGHT AND THE ONE THAT\nEXPLODED IN SEASIDE PARK, NEW JERSEY, BEFORE A MARINE CORPS 5K\nCHARITY RUN, HOWEVER, IT'S NOT BEEN CONCLUDE THAT HAD THE\nINCIDENTS ARE CONNECTED. JESSICA SCHNEIDER IS FOLLOWING\nALL OF THAT FOR US. JESSICA?\n>> THIS INVESTIGATION VERY WIDE RANGING.\nYOU CAN SEE A FLURRY OF ACTIVITY BEHIND ME AS POLICE VEHICLES\nCOME IN AND OUT OF WHAT WAS A CRIME SCENE.\nWE'RE AT WEST 23rd STREET WHERE THE EXPLOSION WENT OFF AT 8:30.\nTHE COMMISSIONER SAYING ONE OF THE KEY COMPONENTS IS VIDEO.\nJAMES O'NEILL SAYING THAT THEY HAVE OBTAINED SURVEILLANCE VIDEO\nFROM ALL AROUND THIS AREA FROM THE TWO DISTINCT CRIME SCENES,\nWHERE THE UNEXPLODED PRESSURE COOKER WAS FOUND.\nTHE COMMISSIONER SAYING THEY ARE LOOKED AT THE VIDEO AND WE'VE\nGOTTEN A LOOK AS WELL. THIS IS A VERY BUSY BUSINESS\nDISTRICT WITH BARS, RESTAURANT, BUSINESSES, A LOT OF THEM.\nMOST HAVING SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS SO, WHAT WE'VE SEEN, WE SEE\nMOMENTS WHEN THE EXPLOSION WENT OFF, YOU SEE THE BURST OF LIGHT\nFROM THE EXPLOSION. YOU ALSO SEE THE REACTION FROM\nTHE PEOPLE ON THE STREET HERE. THIS HAPPENED AT 8:30 ON A\nSATURDAY NIGHT. THIS IS A VERY BUSY DISTRICT.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE LIVE HERE. THEY COME HERE FOR\nENTERTAINMENT. THERE'S CLUBS AND RESTAURANTS\nAND BARS. YOU CAN SEE FROM INSIDE ONE OF\nTHE BUSINESSES, THE SHATTERED GLASS OF O WINDOWS AND DOORS AND\nTHEN STARTLED AND DISTURBED AND UPSET REACTION FROM THE PEOPLE\nWHO ARE ON THE STREET, ON WEST 23rd RIGHT HERE.\nAS THEY SCATTER AND MOVE TO GET OUT OF THE WAY.\nTO FLEE THIS EXPLOSION SITE. SO NOW, INVESTIGATORS ARE\nLOOKING AT THIS VIDEO, PIECING IT TOGETHER.\nTHEY'RE ASKING WITNESSES FOR ADDITIONAL VIDEO AS WELL AND\nWE'RE LEARNING ONE OF THOSE VIDEOS THAT THEY GOT A HOLD OF\nDOES FEATURE AN INDIVIDUAL IN THE GENERAL AREA OF THIS\nEXPLOSION. INVESTIGATORS ARE TRYING TO\nFIGURE OUT IF THE INDIVIDUAL IS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EXPLOSION,\nTRYING TO IDENTIFY THIS INDIVIDUAL AS WELL.\nTHE OTHER KEY COMPONENT IN ADDITION TO THE VIDEO IS ALSO\nFORENSICS. THE STATE POLICE HAVE ALSO TAKEN\nTHE REMNANTS OF EXPLOSIVE DEVICE.\nALSO, THAT UNEXPLODED PRESSURE COOKER STATE POLICE ARE K LOOING\nAT THAT, THE BOMB SQUAD IS LOOKING AT THAT, BUT IT'S ALSO\nBEING LOOKED AT IN QUANTICO, VIRGINIA, SO MANY DIFFERENT\nAG AGENCIES.\nTHE FBI FIELD OFFICE HERE IN NEW YORK SAYING THIS CRIME SCENE\nWILL BE AS SUCH UNTIL WELL INTO THIS EVENING.\nTHESE STREET IN THE CHELSEA NEIGHBORHOOD WILL BE LOCKED DOWN\nFOR SOME TIME TODAY. GOVERNOR CUOMO WAS HEREEARLIER,\nSAID THE SUBWAYS SHOULD BE RUNNING TOMORROW.\nHE ALSO STRESSES HE'LL BE DEPLOYING 1000 GUARD MEMBERS\nINTO THE SUBWAY TERMINAL, BUS TERMINALS AND AT THE AIRPORT, SO\nOBVIOUSLY A WIDE RANGING INVESTIGATION.\nWITH A LOT OF PRECAUTIONS. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH.\nWE'LL CHECK BACK WITH YOU. LET ME BRING BACK OUR PANEL NOW.\nWE'VE GOT EVAN PEREZ, ART, MATTHEW, SHIMONE AND PAUL.\nWE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE REPORTED SIMILARITIES FROM\nSHIMONE AND EVAN'S REPORTINGING. SIMILARITIES OF CELL PHONES\nWITHIN THESE DEVICES, BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENCES IN THE\nDEVICES IN NEW JERSEY AND NEW YORK, SO MATTHEW, WE'RE TALKING\nABOUT SOME OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE SUBSTANCES, SUBSTANCES,\nTHINGS SEEM LIKE THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT AND WE'RE TALKING\nABOUT PRESSURE COOKER VERSUS ANOTHER DEVICE.\n>> NUMBER ONE, BLACK POWDER, COMMONLY USED IN THE USE OF PIPE\nBOMBS. FIRST RESPONDERS ARE PEOPLE\nWITNESSING INCIDENTS, THEY MAY SEE WE SAW A CHIT WHITE CLOUD OF\nSMOEX WHEN THE EXPLOSION OC OCCURRED.\nINVESTIGATORS KNOW BLACK POWDER MAY HAVE BEEN USED.\nTHE PRESSURE COOKER HAS BEEN SEPTEMBER LAB.\nTHEY CAN DETERMINE WHAT TYPE OF EXPLOSION WAS USED.\nTHE OTHER THING IS THE FRAGMENTS FROM THE PIPE BOMB THAT EXPLODED\nAND THE ONES THAT EXPLODED IN NEW YORK WILL BE EXAMINED TO TRY\nTO DETERMINE WHAT TYPE OF EXPLOSIVES IS ON THE INSIDE OF\nTHOSE PIECES AND THEY'LL PULL THIS TOGETHER FAIRLY QUICKLY FOR\nUS. >> ARE THESE ALL THINGS THAT CAN\nBE HOMEMADE, WHICH WOULD MAKE IT THAT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO\nTRACE? THE COMPONENTS, THE PURCHASE OF\nTHESE COMPONENTS TO FIND THE SUSPECTS?\n. >> WEAPONS OR NIGS, THE KEY PART\nHERE THAT I FIND INTERESTING WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE EVENTS IS\nTHAT WE HAD A GOOD COMBINATION OF POLICE WORK, LUCK AND MAYBE\nINCOMPETENCE ON THE PART OF THE BOMBMAKERS EITHER REPLACE M OF\nTHE BOMBS OR THINKING THERE WOULD BE A SYRUP THETIC\nEXPLOSION WITH THE DEVICE IN ENERGY, WHERE ONLY ONE OF THE\nPIPE BOMBS WENT OFF, THE OTHER TWO DIDN'T.\nTHAT'S KEY. THOSE OTHER TWO WERE ATTACKED.\nTHAT'S ANOTHER KEY PART, AS WELL AS THE OTHER DEVICE THAT DIDN'T\nGO OFF UP IN NEW YORK CITY. SO YOU'VE GOT GREAT POLICE WORK,\nA LITTLE BIT OF LUCK AND MAYBE INCOMPETENCE ON THE BOMB MAKER'S\nPART, ALL COMING TOGETHER TO REALLY MAKE THIS AN EVENT WHERE\nWE COULD HAVE HAD A LOT OF FATALITIES AND DID NOT.\n>> THERE MAY WITH A THINK THAG BECAUSE DEVICES ARE SO DIMPBTS,\nTHEY CAN'T BE FROM THE SAME GROUP OF INFLUENCE S. THAT\nREALLY THE CASE? >> I WOULD SAY I DON'T THINK\nANYONE REALLY KNOWS. I THINK SOME FOLKS WHO WE'VE\nTALKED SO, WE JUST DON'T KNOW. THAT'S PROBABLY THE BEST THING\nTO DO NOW. SOME ARE SAYING THIS COULD GO ON\nFOR WEEKS. >> A VERY BUSY WEEK IN NEW YORK.\nMEET THG WEEK AND NOW, THIS. >> THEY'RE ADDING EXTRA, EXTRA\nLAYERS AND SUBWAYS ALL OVER THE CITY.\nA LOT OF IT IS TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL SAFE, TOO.\nAND THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF WORK.\nI'M JUST SORT OF LOOKING AT 23rd STREET AND WHERE THE BLAST\nOCCURRED IN CHELSEA. IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THEY\nHAVE NOT FOUND ANY GOOD U SURVEILLANCE VIDEO TO SEE WHO\nDID THIS. IT'S CRAZY TO THINK THAT, BUT\nTHAT'S WHERE WE ARE NOW. JUST DON'T HAVE ANY GOOD LEADS\nOF WHO WAS BEHIND THIS. THERE'S A LOT OF WORK.\n>> AND PAUL, YOU'VE GOT THREE, THREE PIVOTAL INCIDENTS\nHAPPENING THIS WEEKEND. MINNESOTA, WE HEARD THE\nINVESTIGATEORS THERE. THE SUSPECT, THEY'RE LOOKING\nFURTHER INTO THEM. ISIS CLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY,\nCALLING HIM A SOLDIER. IT'S SILENT.\nAS IT PERTAINS TO WHAT TOOK PLACE IN NEW JERSEY AND NEW\nYORK, DOES THAT SAY ANYTHING, INDICATE ANYTHING TO YOU?\n>> MAYBE. INCIDENTS IN NEW JERSEY, IN NEW\nYORK. THEY WOULD LOVE TO CLAIM SOME\nKIND OF OWNERSHIP BEFORE WORLD LEADERS COME TO NEW YORK.\nSO FAR, THEY HAVE PUT OFF NO PRIOR STATEMENT AT ALL SUGGESTS\nTHEY SAY THE INDIVIDUAL WAS RADICALIZED.\nTHAT MAY CHANGE IN THE HOURS AHEAD.\nBUT IF THEY HAD ANY INKLING THAT THIS GUY WAS DOING IT IN THEIR\nNAME, I THINK WE WOULD HAVE HAD A STATEMENT OUT THEM ALREADY.\nEVERY HOUR THAT GOES PAST AND THERE'S THO CLAIM FROM A DPROUP\nLIKE ISIS, WILL TELL US SOMETHING.\n>> GOT A LOT GOING ON.

CLOUD, MINNESOTA,\nSAYING THEY ARE INVESTIGATING THE STABBING OF NINE PEOPLE AT A\nMALL AS A POTENTIAL ACT OF TERRORISM.\nISIS NOW CLAIMING THE ATTACK WAS CARRIED OUT BY A SOLDIER OF THE\nISLAMIC STATE. THE SUSPECT WAS SHOT DEAD BY AN\nOFFICE DUTY POLICE OFFICER. WE NOW HAVE BRAND-NEW VIDEO OF\nTHE MOMENT THAT EXPLOSION ROCKED THE NEW YORK CITY NEIGHBORHOOD\nOF CHELSEA. TAKE A LOOK.\nYOU'RE GOING TO SEE THAT CAR THAT IS STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF\nTHE STREET, AN EXPLOSION RIGHT THERE.\nTHEN YOU'LL SEE PEOPLE SCATTERING JUST AS YOU SEE THE\nDEBRIS SCATTERING. PEOPLE RUNNING AWAY.\nCARS SPEEDING. INVESTIGATORS ARE NOW SAYING\nTHEY HAVE FOUND SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THAT DEVICE IN NEW YORK\nAND THE ONE THAT EXPLODED IN SEASIDE PARK, NEW JERSEY, ON THE\nSAME DAY THIS WEEKEND BEFORE A MARINE CORPS CHARITY 5K RUN.\nTHE INVESTIGATORS HAVE NOT CONCLUDED THE EVENTS IN NEW YORK\nAND NEW JERSEY ARE CONNECTED. MORE ON THE BREAKING NEWS OUT OF\nNEW YORK, I'LL BRING IN CNN'S DEB FEYERICK.\nWHAT MORE HAVE YOU LEARNED? >> ONE THING WE CAN IDENTIFY IS\nTHE SECOND DEVICE ON 27th STREET, THAT HAD A CELL PHONE\nATTACHED TO IT. WHAT THAT SUGGESTS ACCORDING TO\nEXPERTS IS THAT THERE WAS A HIGHER LEVEL OF SOPHISTICATION\nIN ORDER TO MAKE THAT DEVICE. THE BOMB SQUAD HAS BEEN HANDLING\nIT ALL AFTERNOON BECAUSE THAT DEVICE, BECAUSE IT DIDN'T\nEXPLODE, COULD HAVE ADDITIONAL CLUES.\nA FINGERPRINT. A PIECE OF HAIR.\nSOME OTHER SORT OF DNA THAT CAN HELP IDENTIFY WHO WAS\nRESPONSIBLE FOR THAT DEVICE. IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER THAT PERSON\nAND THE PERSON WHO PLANTED THE DEVICE HERE ON 23rd STREET, JUST\nBEHIND ME, WHETHER THEY ARE ONE AND THE SAME.\nALL OF THAT RIGHT NOW UNDER INVESTIGATION.\nI WALKED BY THERE A LITTLE WHILE AGO, AND YOU'VE GOT TEAMS OF\nFORENSIC INVESTIGATORS FROM THE FBI AND NYPD.\nTHEY'RE LOOKING AT EVERYSHRAPNE. TRYING TO IDENTIFY IF ANY OF IT\nIS FROM THE DEVICE OR WHETHER IT WAS COLLATERAL FROM THE IMPACT\nOF THE BLAST EXPLOSION. NOW, WE CAN TELL YOU THAT RIGHT\nNOW, THEY DON'T KNOW WHO IS RESPONSIBLE.\nNOBODY HAS STEPPED FORWARD TO CLAIM ANY RESPONSIBILITY.\nNOR DO THEY KNOW WHY IT WAS PLACED HERE IN CHELSEA.\nBUT THE NYPD HAS A VERY SOPHISTICATED SURVEILLANCE,\nSECURITY SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM THROUGHOUT THE CITY.\nTHEY'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT ALL VIDEO.\nIT'S NOT JUST VIDEO FROM STORES, BUT IT'S ALSO VIDEO THAT IS SORT\nOF STRATEGICALLY PLACED THROUGHOUT.\nSO THEY CAN MORE TORRNITOR WHAT GOING ON.\nTHIS IS VERY ACTIVE RIGHT NOW. YOU A LOT OF PEOPLE WORKING ON A\nLOT OF DIFFERENT COMPONENTS. AS FAR AS THIS OPERATIONAL\nSECURITY, THEY'RE NOT SAYING A LOT ABOUT WHAT THEY DO HAVE, BUT\nTHEY ARE MAKING EVERY EFFORT TO PROCESS EVERY PIECE OF EVIDENCE\nAS QUICKLY AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN, FREDRICKA.\n>> DEB, WE KNOW THE BLOCKADE IS UP.\nWE SEE THE POLICE VEHICLES BEHIND YOU.\nWE ALSO JUST SAW A MAN AND WOMAN WITH A STROLLER, BABY STROLLER,\nWALKING BEHIND YOU. THIS IS COMPLICATED PAUSE THIS\nIS A VERY RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITY. LOTS OF BUSINESSES, TOO.\nBUT HOW ARE PEOPLE ABLE TO LIVE THERE WITH THIS INVESTIGATION\nUNDERWAY, AND THE PROMISE OF A NEW WORK WEEK STARTING TOMORROW?\n>> WELL, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.\nTHAT'S AN EXCELLENT POINT. IT ALMOST REMINDS ME OF 9/11,\nWHEN IN ORDER TO GET ANYWHERE, YOU HAD TO SHOW IDENTIFICATION,\nSAYING YOU LIVED IN A CERTAIN PART OF TOWN.\nTHAT IS HAPPENING HERE. WE'VE SEEN A COUPLE OF PEOPLE\nWHO HAD TO SHOW A LICENSE TO INDICATE THAT THEY DO LIVE ON\n23rd STREET. THEY'RE NOT JUST LETTING ANYONE\nGO IN AND OUT. THEY'RE TRYING TO KEEP THIS\nSCENE AS SORT OF CALM AND AS PURE AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN.\nTHAT SPECIFICALLY IS TRUE FOR WHERE THEY'RE DOING THE MAJORITY\nOF WORK. IT HAS BEEN A DISRUPTION IN THIS\nENTIRE AREA. THE TIMING OF THIS DEVICE, ALSO\nVERY QUESTIONABLE. WHY THEY DID IT, YOU KNOW, AT\n8:00 ON A SATURDAY NIGHT IN AN AREA, WHILE THERE WERE A LOT OF\nPEOPLE, THERE WERE AREAS CLOSE BY THAT HAD EVEN MORE PEOPLE.\nWHY WAS IT IN A DUMPSTER? USUALLY, WHEN A BOMB SQUAD FINDS\nSOMETHING, IF THERE IS A THREAT OF DETONATION, THE FIRST THING\nTHEY'LL LOOK FOR IS A DUMPSTER THAT THEY CAN PUT IT IN IN ORDER\nTO BLUNT THE IMPACT. THAT MAY HAVE BEEN WHY SOME OF\nTHE INJURIES, FREDRICKA, WERE LESS THAN THEY OTHERWSE WOULD\nHAVE BEEN, HAD THAT DUMPSTER NOT BLUNTED THE IMPACT.\nALL OF THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT AUTHORITIES ARE LOOKING INTO AS\nTHEY TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHO DID IT AND WHY.\nTHE CELL PHONE, VERY DISCONCERNING.\nTHAT MEANS UNLIKE THE BOSTON MARATHON, WHERE THE BOMBERS WERE\nCLOSE TO THE DEVICE, WITH A CELL PHONE, YOU CAN BE A GREAT\nDISTANCE FROM THE DEVICE. THAT RAISES A LOT OF ADDITIONAL\nCONCERNS, AS WELL, FREDRICKA. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH.\nKEEP US POSTED THERE.",

POLICE NOW SAYING THEY FOUND\nSIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE BOMB THAT WENT OFF IN NEW YORK CITY\nLAST NIGHT AND THE BOMB THAT WENT OFF IN SEASIDE PARK, NEW\nJERSEY. HOWEVER, INVESTIGATORS HAVE NOT\nCONCLUDED THAT THE INCIDENTS ARE CONNECTED.\nLET ME BRING BACK OUR PANEL OF EXPERTS TO DISCUSS THE\nDEVELOPMENTS. TOM FUENTES.\nMATTHEW AND ART. WE'RE AWAITING THE PRESS\nCONFERENCE AS IT GETS UNDERWAY IN MINNESOTA.\nWE'LL BREAKAWAY. SOMALI COMMUNITY LEADERS IS ALL\nWE'RE BEING TOLD WILL BE CARRYING OUT THE PRESS\nCONFERENCE. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT TOOK PLACE\nIN NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY. TOM, NO DEFINITIVE CONNECTION\nYET FROM AUTHORITIES. ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCES, THERE\nARE SIMILARITIES IN THE WAY OF THE CELLULAR PHONE USE.\nHOW MUCH OF A FINGERPRINT ARE ON THE DEVICES?\n>> THE ONLY INFORMATION INVESTIGATIVELY IS YOU HAVE\nPEOPLE LOOKING AT VARIOUS WEBSITES ON THE INTERNET ON HOW\nTO CONSTRUCT THE DEVICES. GOING TO LIBRARIES AND DOING\nRESEARCH ON THAT. IF YOU'RE GOING TO USE A CELL\nPHONE AS A DETONATING DEVICE OR TIMING DEVICE FOR IT, THEN YOU\nWOULD SEE THAT SIMILARITY IN, YOU KNOW, THE MAKING OF THE\nDEVICE. IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT\nIT WAS THE SAME INDIVIDUAL THAT MADE THE DEVICES OR THE SAME\nBOMB SCHOOL, OTHER THAN IT WAS BEING TALKED ABOUT OR PROMOTED\nAS ONE WAY TO MAKE A DEVICE ON THE INTERNET.\nSIMILAR PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, WITH THE SAME MINDSET, SAW THAT\nINFORMATION. >> ART, IS THIS A COINCIDENCE?\nIS THERE SOMETHING SINISTER IN THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE THREE\nPOSSIBLE TERROR ATTACKS. AGAIN, NOT DEFINITIVELY HAVE\nFE OFFICIALS CALLED ALL OF THE\nINCIDENTS TERROR ATTACKS BUT THE FBI IS SAYING A POSSIBLE TERROR\nATTACK AS IT PERTAINS TO MINNESOTA.\nIS THIS A COINCIDENCE, OR MIGHT BE THERE A LINK?\n>> FRED, FROM A PURELY INVESTIGATIVE STANDPOINT, WHEN\nYOU INVESTIGATE, YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN THE KOINSS.\nTHREE ATTACKS IN A 24 HOUR TIME PERIOD.\nYOU HAVE GOOD POLICE WORK IN THE RESPONSE TO OFFICER FALKNER IN\nMINNESOTA. WE HAVE LUCK IN THE FACT THAT\nTHE BOMBERS WERE SORT OF INEPT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE\nBETWEEN THE EXPLOSION IN SEASIDE, WHERE IT BLEW THE\nBOTTOM OFF OF THE PLASTIC TRASH RECE\nRECEPTACLE, AND YOU SAW TWO TRASH RECEPTACLES NEXT TO IT\nTHAT WERE IN TACT. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE\nEXPLOSION IN CHELSEA, THERE IS A DIFFERENCE THERE.\nI THINK YOU HAVE THE INEPTNESS ON THE BOMB MAKER'S PART AND THE\nPLACEMENT OF THE DEVICE THAT SAVED A LOT OF PEOPLE IN BOTH\nOCCURRENCES. >> SO SAVED A LOT OF PEOPLE,\nMATTHEW, BUT MIGHT IT HAVE BEEN THE INTENT THAT IT WOULD BE USED\nTO INTENSIFY THE ATTACK? THAT IT WOULD LAUNCH ADDITIONAL\nSHR SHRAPNEL?\n>> SURE. EVERY BOMBER HAS A UNIQUE\nSIGNATURE. IN THIS CASE, WE'RE SEEING\nEVIDENCE NOW TO TELL US BOTH OF THE DEVICES THAT WENT OFF HAVE\nSIMILARITIES. THE PRESSURE COOKER BOMB DIDN'T\nGO OFF BUT IT MIGHT BE SIMILAR. >> THE ONLY SIMILARITY, THE CELL\nPHONE. >> YES.\n>> THE WIRING IS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE'VE UNDERSTOOD IN OUR\nINITIAL INFORMATION. ONE IS A PIPE BOMB.\nONE IS A PRESSURE COOKER. THERE ARE DYNAMICS.\nWHAT IS FUELING THE EXPLOSIVES MIGHT BE DIFFERENT, TOO.\n>> VERY WELL MIGHT BE. >> BLACK POWDER IN AT LEAST ONE.\n>> THE ONE WE SAW THE VIDEO OF EARLIER, CLEARLY A PLUME OF\nWHITE SMOKE. >> IN NEW YORK.\n>> IT TELLS US BLACK POWDER OR LITTLE EXPLOSIVE MIGHT HAVE BEEN\nUSED. THE OTHER CASES, THE\nSIMILARITIES BE COME. THE INVESTIGATORS WILL RUN DOWN\nTHE LEADS AND CONTINUE DOWN THE ROAD.\n>> WE'RE LOOKING AT VIDEO THAT WE RECEIVED ONLY WITHIN THE LAST\nHOUR AND A HALF OR SO. DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE OF THE\nEXPLOSION AT 8:30 LAST NIGHT IN CHELSEA THERE.\nYOU SEE EVERYONE IS GOING ABOUT BUSINESS AS USUAL.\nTHEN ONE OF THE CARS STOPS. THEN YOU SEE AN EXPLOSION BEHIND\nHIM. THEN YOU SEE PEOPLE, DEBRIS, ALL\nOF THAT KIND OF, YOU KNOW, IN RAPID MOTION THERE.\nART, DOES ANYTHING STAND OUT IN PARTICULAR AS YOU GET ANOTHER\nCHANCE TO LOOK AT THIS VIDEO IN TERMS OF HOW IT MIGHT REDIRECT\nTHIS INVESTIGATION? >> IT WAS A PRETTY INTENSE\nEXPLOSION, COMPARED TO WHAT HAPPENED AT SEASIDE.\nYOU SEE THE DEBRIS IMMEDIATELY FLYING AROUND.\nI THINK THE KEY PART HERE IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO PUT THIS\nDEVICE TOGETHER AND MAKE A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE OTHER\nDEVICE THAT WAS FOUND ON 27th STREET.\nTAKE A LOOK AT THE SIMILARITY IN THOSE TWO DEVICES.\nMORE THAN LIKELY, THEY WERE VERY SIMILAR.\nBUT THAT'S A PRETTY INTENSE EXPLOSION YOU'RE SEEING THERE.\nBLOWING WINDOWS OUT AND CREATING DAMAGE TO THE BUILDING THAT IT\nWAS NEAR. SO THAT'S AN INTENSE, INTENSE\nBLAST. VERY LUCKY THAT NOBODY LOST\nTHEIR LIVES DURING THIS EXPLOSION.\n>> TOM, YOUR OBSERVATION? >> WELL, I THINK IN LOOKING AT\nTHAT, IT ALMOST LOOKS TO ME LIKE THE CONCUSSION FROM THE BLAST\nMIGHT HAVE BLOWN LOOSE LEAVES OFF THE TREES.\nSOME OF WHAT WE SEE FALLING ON THE SIDEWALK, TO ME, APPEARS TO\nBE LEAVES FALLING DOWN. IT IS, YOU KNOW, AUTUMN NOW.\nWE'RE ABOUT TO HAVE THE LEAVES COME DOWN ON THEIR OWN.\nBUT THEY MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN A LITTLE BOOST FROM THE CONCUSSION\nOF THE BLAST. >> GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH.\nTOM, ART AND MATTHEW, THANK YOU SO MUCH.\nWE'LL PICK UP OUR CONVERSATION. WE'LL BE BACK IN A MOMENT.",

FRIGHTENED PEOPLE ON THE\nSIDEWALKS RUNNING FOR SAFETY NOT KNOWING IF ANOTHER EXPLOSION WAS\nABOUT GO OFF. INVESTIGATORS SAY THAT BOMB AND\nAN EXPLOSION EARLIER HAVE THINGS IN COMMON.\nNO OFFICIAL CONNECTION AT THIS HOUR BUT THE FBI SAYS THEY ARE\nSIMILAR IN DESIGN. THE BOMBING IN NEW YORK CITY\nINJURED 29 PEOPLE. THANKFULLY, WE HAVE LEARNED THEY\nARE ALL OUT OF THE HOSPITAL. POLICE FOUND THE SECONDARY\nEXPLOSIVE DEVICE, A PRESSURE COOKER JUST FOUR BLOCKS FROM THE\nEXPLOSION SITE THAT DID NOT DETONATE.\nAS THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUES, IN MINNESOTA, AN ISIS LINKED\nNEWS AGENCY SAYS MAN WHO STABBED NINE PEOPLE WAS A SOLDIER IN THE\nISLAMIC STATE. THAT MAN IS DEAD, SHOT BY AN OFF\nDUTY POLICE OFFICER. MUCH MORE ON THAT THIS HOUR.\nWE BEGIN IN NEW YORK WHERE CITY AND STATE OFFICIALS ARE\nPROMISING THAT NEW YORK CITY WILL BE BACK TO QUOTE, BUSINESS\nAS USUAL TOMORROW AS THE WORKWEEK BEGINS.\nALSO AS GLOBAL LEADERS DESCEND ON THE CITY.\nSOME STREETS BLOCKED OFF WHILE OFFICIALS CONTINUE TO COMB THE\nAREA FOR CLUES. I UNDERSTAND THERE'S SOME\nACTIVITY BEHIND YOU. WHAT DO YOU SEE?\n>> Reporter: A LITTLE BIT OF ACT\nACTIVITY. YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO SEE THE TWO\nOFFICERS FROM THE NYPD INVESTIGATORS.\nTHEY ARE LOOKING AT A SUBARU THERE TO THE LEFT.\nTHERE'S ONE SQUAD CAR WITH POLICE OFFICERS.\nTHEY SEEM TO BE KEEPING AN EYE ON IT.\nUNCLEAR WHAT THAT CAR IS. WE KNOW THAT IT DOES HAVE NEW\nJERSEY PLATES. INVESTIGATORS ARE LOOKING FOR A\nPOSSIBLE CONNECTION BETWEEN THAT DEVICE THAT DETONATED IN NEW\nJERSEY AND THE ONE THAT DETONATED HERE YESTERDAY EVENING\nAT 8:30 ON WEST 23rd STREET. THE INVESTIGATION VERY MUCH IN\nFULL SWING. EVIDENCE BEING COLLECTED.\nINVESTIGATORS ARE LOOKING FOR ANY POSSIBLE CLUE, A WIRE, A\nDETONATOR, BOMB RESIDUE. ANYTHING THAT CAN GIVE THEM A\nBETTER PICTURE OF WHAT THAT DEVICE WAS MADE OF THAT\nEXPLODED. A KEY PIECE OF EVIDENCE WILL BE\nTHE DUMPSTER BECAUSE THE DUMPSTER WOULD HAVE ABSORBED A\nLOT OF IMPACT OF THE BLAST. SOMEBODY WHO SAID EARLIER SAID\nIF THEY FIND A BOMB, ONE THING THEY DUE IS THROW IT INTO A\nDUMPSTER BECAUSE THEY WANT TO MINIMIZE INJURIES.\nWE KNOW THEY ARE LOOKING AT THE DEVICE THAT WAS ON WEST 27th\nSTREET. THAT IS MORE CRITICAL BECAUSE IT\nWAS INTACT. THERE COULD BE SOME SORT OF DNA,\nA FINGER PRINT, HAIR. THEY ALSO KNOW HOW THE BOMB AND\nTHE DEVICE WAS MADE BECAUSE THERE WAS A CELL PHONE ATAMPED\nTO IT. SOMEONE I SPOKE TO SAID CELL\nPHONE IS A BIT TROUBLING BECAUSE IT SUGGESTS THAT WHOEVER MADE IT\nDID NOT HAVE TO BE CLOSE TO IT IN ORDER FOR IT TO DETONATE.\nTHEY COULD PLACE A CALL AND HAD IT GO OFF.\nIT'S DIFFERENT TO THE BOSTON MORTON BOMBING WHERE THE TWO IN\nTHAT PARTICULAR CASE WERE REALLY IN THE VICINITY OF THAT\nEXPLOSIVE DEVICE. ALL OF THAT RIGHT NOW UNDER\nREVIEW OF THE CELL PHONE. CRITICAL IN TERMS OF WHAT THE\nINVESTIGATION SUGGESTS. >> THEY'RE STILL ASKING ANYONE\nIN THE AREA IF THEY HAVE ANY VIDEO, OVERHEARD ANY\nCONVE CONVERSATION, ANYTHING AT ALL TO\nCALL THE TIPS NUMBER TO HELP POLICE GET TO THE BOTTOM OF\nTHIS. THEY DON'T KNOW THE MOTIVE AND\nTHEIR NOT NAMING ANYONE. LET'S BRING IN OUR PANEL.\nTHE FBI IS CALLING THIS THE THREE BOMBS IN NEW YORK SIMILAR.\nLET'S TALK TO ED DAVIS. HE WAS THE COMMISSIONER BACK IN\n2013 DURING THE BOSTON MARATHON BOMBING.\nALSO WITH ME CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST.\nTHANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. JUST TO BEGIN WITH YOU, LET'S\nCOMPARE YOUR REACTION IN THE FIRST HOURS AFTER THE HORRIFIC\nBOMBING IN BOSTON. THEY SAID IT WAS INTENTIONAL BUT\nDID NOT LICNK IT TO TERRORISM. WHAT WOULD MAKE THINK NOT MAKE\nTHE JUMP? >> I WAS IN NEW YORK ON FRIDAY\nNIGHT WITH THE COMMISSIONER AND I CAN TELL YOU THEY ARE DOING\nTHE SAME THING WES DID FOLLOWING THE MARATHON.\nTHEY ARE LOOKIN INAT THE EVIDEN. THERE IS A HESITANCE TO USE THE\nTERRORISM WORD. THERE'S A LOT OF POLITICAL\nREASONS FOR THAT. I THINK IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE\nTHERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES THAT MIGHT DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN WHAT\nWE WERE SEEING HERE IN NEW YORK AND WHAT HAPPENED IN THE\nMARATHON. I HAD TWO POWERF FUL BLASTS.\nI HAD A NUMBER OF VICTIMS, OVER 200 VICTIMS.\nI HAD SHRAPNEL ON THE GROUND. I HAD THESE GOING OFF IN CLOSE\nPROXIMITY IN TIME AND SPACE. WE BELIEVE THERE HAD TO BE TWO\nPEOPLE. THERE WAS A LOT OF INFORMATION\nTHAT WE HAD THAT MADE IT REALLY STRAIGHTFORWARD.\nI THINK MOSTLY, I SAT DOWN WITH RICK WHO WAS THE SPECIAL AGENT\nIN CHARGE OF THE FBI AND WE ALL HAD THE SAME FEELING.\nI THINK AT THAT POINT EVEN GOVERNOR PATRICK SAID THIS\nSHOULD GO TO THE FBI VERY QUICKLY.\nLITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT SITUATION IN NEW YORK BUT\nCLEARLY IT'S A DIFFICULT DECISION TO MAKE.\n>> THEY PUT THESE PIPE BOMBS IN A GARBAGE CAN.\nIN NEW JERSEY ONLY ONE DETONATED AND THEY PUT THIS IN A DUMPSTER\nIN NEW YORK. WHY?\n>> PROBABLY TO THWART THE EFFORTS OF IF YOU SEE SOMETHING,\nSAY SOMETHING. WHO'S GOING TO LOOK IN THE\nDUMPSTER OR INSIDE A TRASH CAN OR PLASTIC GARBAGE BAG THAT MAY\nBE INSIDE A BIGGER CONTAINER. IF YOU HAVE A LOOSE CONTAINER ON\nTHE SIDEWALK IT'S GOING TO BE MORE SUSPICIOUS.\nIT'S MORE LIKELY TO HAVE SOMEBODY CALL THE POLICE AND\nREPORT IT COMPARED TO DEBRIS THAT'S THROWN INTO A DUMPSTER OR\nA NORMAL TRASH CAN. >> OUR VIEWERS ARE LOOKING AT\nLIVE PICTURES OUT OF NEW YORK CITY TONIGHT JUST ALMOST 24\nHOURS AFTER THE BOMB EXPLODED ON WEST 23rd.\nTHEY HAVE POLICE TAPE AROUND THIS VEHICLE.\nWE DON'T KNOW WHY. THEY ARE SCOURING THE AREA FOR\nANY CLUES. THERE COULD BE THREE SEPARATE\nACTS IN ONE DAY. HERE IS SOME THINGS POSITIVE.\nIS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE EXEMPLOYES YESTERDAY MORNING WAS\nCALL TO ACTION FOR ANY SYMPATHIZERS?\n>> VERY WELL COULD BE. I DON'T WANT TO CLOSE OFF ANY\nPOSSIBILITY. I WOULD SAY THE NEW JERSEY\nBOMBINGS WERE PRETTY UNSUCCESSFUL.\nTHEY WEREN'T EVEN LEADING THE NEWS FOR MOST OF YESTERDAY.\nIN TERMS OF BEING CALL TO ACTION, IT'S A PRETTY SUBTLE OR\nUNSUCCESSFUL ONE. I'M DEFINITELY MUCH FOR SAYING\nTHAT THE TIES BETWEEN NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY MIGHT BE MORE\nLIKELY. LET'S BE CLEAR HERE, THOSE\nDEVICES ARE PRETTY RUDIMENTARY. THE INFORMATION IS OUT THERE ON\nTHE WEB FOR ANY GROUP TO TAKE. ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I'VE BEEN\nSORT OF MORE COMFORTABLE WAITING ON THE TERRORISM WORD,\nUNDERSTANDING THAT THERE'S TERROR OUT THERE IS BECAUSE THE\nINFORMATION RIGHT NOW IS CUTTING IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT\nDIRECTIONS. THERE'S PIECES THAT AREN'T\nMAKING A LOT OF SENSE TO US THAT KNOW THE CASES.\nTHE INVESTIGATORS SHOULD CONTINUE WITH THE OPEN\nINVESTIGATION UNTIL THEY CAN NARROW IT DOWN.\n>> WAS IT FOR YOU AND YOUR TEAM AND THE FBI IN BOSTON WAS THE\nMOST HELPFUL TO IDENTIFYING THE SARNAEV BROTHERS WHERE THE BOMBS\nWENT OFF IN BOSTON AND THE BOMB WENT OFF HERE IN NEW YORK CITY\nLAST NIGHT. OBVIOUSLY, A LOT OF CAMERAS IN\nTHE AREA. WHAT WAS THE SINGLE MOST HELPFUL\nTHING IN IDENTIFYING THE BROTHERS?\n>> THE FORENSIC EVIDENCE IS IMPORTANT.\nYOU HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT DEVICES WERE USED.\nTHE BIGGEST BREAK CAME FROM VIDEO.\nIT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE. THIS DIGITAL EVIDENCE THAT WE\nCAN ACCESS NOW IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF\nEVIDENCE. I SPOKE TO THE POLICE\nCOMMISSIONER IN LONDON AFTER THE BOMBINGS AND HE TOLD ME HE WOULD\nNOT HAVE SOLVED THE CASE IF IT WASN'T FOR VIDEO.\nNEW YORK IS SET UP IN A FAMILIAR FASHION AS FAR AS CITY OWNED\nVIDEO THAT'S AVAILABLE ON THE STREET.\nTHEY JUST HAVE TO PROCESS THAT. IT TAKES A LONG TIME.\nTHERE ARE NO SYSTEMS AVAILABLE TO DO IT AUTOMATICALLY.\nIT TAKES DAYS AND SOMETIMES WEEKS BEFORE THEY CAN GET TO THE\nRIGHT PLACE. YOU'RE ALREADY SEEING SOME\nMOVEMENT IN THAT AREA. THAT'S BEGIGOING TO BE THE SING\nMOST IMPORTANT THING. >> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE FACT\nTHAT MINNESOTA HAS HAD SOMEONE CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE\nINSPIRATION OF THE ATTACK THERE. THAT BEING ISIS.\nWHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE FACT THAT IN NEW JERSEY AND HERE IN\nNEW YORK ALMOST 24 HOURS LATER NO CLAIM OF RESPONSIBILITY?\n>> ISIS DOESN'T ALWAYS COME OUT IMMEDIATELY EVEN IN AN ISIS\nINSPIRED ATTACK. PART OF THE REASON MIGHT BE THE\nWAY THIS WAS INITIALLY REPORTED ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY SAID THE\nACT WAS INTENTIONAL BUT THEY WEREN'T GOING TO LINK IT TO\nTERRORISM THAT ISIS MAY HAVE BEEN A LITTLE CAUTIOUS THINKING\nTHIS COULD BE A PSYCHOPATH WHO LEARNED HOW TO MAKE A BOMB AND\nDECIDED TO DETONATE IT AND HARM PEOPLE AND GET ATTENTION AND\nISN'T REALLY A TRUE SOLDIER OF THE ISLAMIC STATE UNLIKE THE\nSITUATION IN MING YAP LIS WHERE THERE WAS MORE INFORMATION TO\nINDICATE IT PROBABLY WAS SOMEBODY INSPIRED BY ISIS.\n>> STAY WITH ME BECAUSE I WANT TO TAKE US BACK TO DEBRA ON THE\nGROUND TONIGHT. YOU HAVE POLICE VEHICLE IN FRONT\nOF THIS SUBARU THAT THEY ARE LOOKING AT.\nDO WE KNOW WHY? >> WE DON'T.\nIT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A FORENSIC INVESTIGATOR FROM THE NYPD.\nSHE'S TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS. IT LOOKS LIKE RIGHT NOW SHE IS\nSCRAPING OR TRYING TO GATHER EVIDENCE FROM THE VEHICLE.\nTHEY JUST BROUGHT IN THAT LARGE VEHICLE JUST MOMENTS AGO.\nTHIS CAR IS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST TO THEM.\nIT'S ALSO GOT NEW JERSEY PLATES ON IT.\nWHETHER THEY HAVE DETERMINED THERE'S A CONNECTION BETWEEN\nTHIS NEW JERSEY CAR AND PERHAPS THE INNOCENT THAT HAPPENED HERE\nON WEST 23rd STREET AND THE INCIDENT THAT HAPPENED OUT IN\nNEW JERSEY, WE DON'T KNOW. WE CAN ALSO SEE A COUPLE OF FIRE\nTRUCKS BEHIND US. WE DID CHECK WITH THE FIRE\nDEPARTMENT TO SEE IF IT WAS CONNECTED TO THE DISCOVERY OF\nTHIS VEHICLE. WE'RE TOLD THEY HAVE FIRE TRUCKS\nON SCENE. >> JUST SET UP FOR US WHERE YOU\nARE. IF WE CAN SEE THE RELATION OF\nWHERE YOU ARE TO THAT VEHICLE. WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME IS\nTHEY'RE NOT CLEARING YOU OUT. WE SAW THE 27th STREET LOCATION\nTHEY PUSHED RICHARD QUEST VERY QUICK VERBALLY SAYING MOVE OUT\nOF WAY. MOVE OUT OF WAY.\nWE KNOW THAT'S BECAUSE THE PRESSURE COOKER BOMB WAS THERE.\nYOU'RE A QUARTER OF A BLOCK AWAY AND THEY'RE NOT DOING THAT.\n>> THEY'RE NOT DOING THAT AT ALL.\nWE WERE QUITE CLOSE TO THE CAR. ONE THING I LEARN FRD THE BOSTON\nMARATHON IS IF YOU CAN SEE THE BOMB, THE BOMB CAN SEE YOU.\nTHE INVESTIGATORS THAT ARE WORKING THAT CAR AND TRYING TO\nGATHER EVIDENCE ARE NOT WEARING ANY PROTECTIVE GEAR.\nWHATEVER THEY HAVE DONE SUGGESTS THAT THEY DO NOT NEED TO BE\nWEARING SOME SORT OF PROTECTIVE GEAR.\nTHEY ARE BRINGING IN THAT SECOND TRUCK.\nWE CAN'T QUITE TELL -- THEY'RE OPENING THE BACK.\nWE CAN'T TELL WHAT THEY'RE DOING.\nTHAT CAR IS OF DEFINITE INTEREST, POPPY.\n>> THANK YOU. STAY WITH ME.\nWHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS? A LOT OF DETAILS WE DON'T KNOW.\nDEB MADE AN IMPORTANT POINT. THEY ARE LETTING HER STAY CLOSE\nTO THIS AND THEY'RE NOT WEARING ANY PROTECTIVE GEAR, THE\nINVESTIGATORS. >> FRANKLY, ANY CAR WITH A NEW\nJERSEY PLATE ON IT IN THE PROXIMITY OF THIS INCIDENT IN\nLIGHT OF WHAT HAPPENED IN NEW JERSEY EARLIER IN THE DAY WOULD\nBE CAUSE FOR THIS TYPE OF LOOK. THEY WOULD BE EVACUATING THE\nAREA AS IMMEDIATE FIRST",

WHAT'S NOTABLE TO YOU, DEB?\n>> Reporter: WHAT WE TELL YOU IS THAT THAT TRUCK THAT'S PARKED IN\nFRONT OF IT IS A FLAT BED WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THEY WANT TO MOVE\nTHAT CAR OFF THIS STREET AND GET A CLOSER LOOK AT IT.\nYOU MAY BE ABLE TO SEE A DETECTIVE THERE OR INVESTIGATOR\nWITH A CAMERA. THEY HAVE BEEN TAKING MULTIPLE\nPICTURES OF THAT CAR FROM THIS ANGLE.\nI WAS LOOKING AROUND TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY VIDEO CAMERAS\nBELONGING TO THE NYPD. THERE IS ONE AT THIS BUSY\nINTERSECTION. I DON'T KNOW SORT OF THE\nRESOLUTION WHETHER THEY WERE ABLE TO SEE SOMETHING THAT\nPERHAPS ALLOW THEM TO IDENTIFY THIS CAR AS THE PARTICULAR\nVEHICLE OF INTEREST. THE STATIONED MARKED POLICE CAR\nRIGHT NEXT TO IT. THIS IS CLEARLY SOMETHING THAT\nMIGHT HAVE SOME INFORMATION. THEY ARE CURIOUS ABOUT AND THE\nFACT IT HAS NEW JERSEY PLAITS. EXTREMELY SIGNIFICANT IF THEY\nCAN MAKE SOME CONNECTION BETWEEN THE DEVICE EXPLODED HERE AND THE\nDEVICE THAT EXPLODED IN SEA VIEW, NEW JERSEY YESTERDAY.\nWE'RE HOPING TO GET A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION ON THAT CAR.\nRIGHT NOW WE BELIEVE THEY WILL TAKE IT AWAY, CERTAINLY WITHIN\nTHE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS. >> STAND BY.\nLET'S BRING BACK TOM FUENTES.

DEBRA, AS FAR AS WE KNOW THERE\nWAS A TRAFFIC STOP THAT HAPPENED ON A BRIDGE.\nWHAT MORE CAN YOU TELL US? >> Reporter: AT ABOUT 8:45\nSUNDAY EVENING, THIS WAS A VEHICLE OF INTEREST.\nTHAT'S HOW THE FBI DESCRIBED. BUT THEY ALSO SAY THAT NO ONE\nHAS BEEN CHARGED WITH ANY CRIME. OBVIOUSLY, A LOT OF QUESTIONS.\nHOW DID THIS VEHICLE BECOME A VEHICLE OF INTEREST?\nINVESTIGATORS RIGHT NOW FOLLOWING A LOT OF THREADS, A\nLOT OF REALLY STRONG CLUES THAT THEY DEVELOPED OVER THE COURSE\nOF THE LAST 24 HOURS. WE CAN TELL YOU SOURCES NOW TELL\nCNN LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS SURVEILLANCE VIDEO OF THE MAN\nTHEY BELIEVE WAS NEAR BOTH THE DUMPSTER BUT ALSO THE SECOND\nLOCATION. NOW, THE MAN WAS ROLLING A BLACK\nDUFFEL BAG. HE IS SEEN AT THE DUMPSTER ON\nWEST 23rd STREET. HE THEN MAKES HIS WAY NORTH UP\nTO 27th STREET, FOUR BLOCKS, LEAVES THE DUFFEL BAG AND THEN\nWALKS AWAY. TWO MEN SUBSEQUENTLY COME UP,\nOPEN THE DUFFEL BAG, TAKE OUT THE DEVICE, AND WALK AWAY WITH\nTHE DUFFEL BAG. IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT CONNECTION\nTHEY HAVE TO THIS PARTICULAR INCIDENT WHETHER THEY JUST\nWANTED TO TAKE THE DUFFEL BAG, BUT 40 MINUTES ELAPSES FROM THE\nTIME THAT MAN IS IDENTIFIED ON THE SURVEILLANCE VIDEO TO THE\nTIME THE BOMB DETONATES. AND INVESTIGATORS DID FIND A\nCELL PHONE ON THE DEVICE THAT DID NOT DETONATE.\nTHAT IS A CRUCIAL PIECE OF EVIDENCE THEY'RE LOOKING AT VERY\nCLOSELY TO SEE WHETHER ANY CALLS WERE MADE INTO THAT PHONE\nBECAUSE THAT COULD LEAD THEM TO IDENTIFY WHO MAY HAVE BEEN IN\nTHAT AREA AND WHAT NUMBER THEY MAY HAVE BEEN CALLING FROM, A\nSOURCE EARLIER TELLING ME THAT THE FACT THAT THERE'S A CELL\nPHONE INVOLVED COULD SUGGEST THAT IT WAS USED AS A DETONATOR\nTO EXPLODE THE DEVICE, AND THE CALL COULD HAVE BEEN MADE FROM\nANYWHERE. NOW POLICE OFFICERS DID FIND\nTHAT SECOND DEVICE. THEY WERE DOING A SWEEP OF THE\nAREA. ONCE THE FIRST BOMB EXPLODED.\nAND THAT'S WHEN HAD HE FOUND THAT.\nTHE NEW YORK BOMB SQUAD WAS ABLE TODAY TO RENDER THE DEVICE SAFE.\nTHAT MEANS THEY WERE ABLE TO SEND IT DOWN TO THE FBI LAB IN\nQUANTICO FOR A MORE THOROUGH ANALYSIS.\nBUT THE TWO BIG QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW, WHO DID THIS, WHY DID THEY\nDO THIS, AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT MULTIPLE CONNECTIONS TO MULTIPLE\nINCIDENTS THAT SEEM TO BE OCCURRING REALLY IN THIS NOW\n36-HOUR SPAN, BUT KEEP IN MIND, DOLLARS THE UNITED NATIONS\nGENERAL ASSEMBLY THAT'S GOING TO BE IN NEW YORK CITY THIS WEEK.\nA LOT OF WORLD LEADERS ARE COMING TO TOWN.\nSECURITY WAS ALREADY TIGHT. IT'S GOING TO BE EVEN TIGHTER AS\nTHE FBI, THE NYPD, ATF, ALL OF THEM WORK VERY CLOSELY TOGETHER\nIN ORDER TO TRY TO FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING ON HERE.\n>> ABSOLUTELY, SOME VERY BUSY TIMES THERE.\nWE WANT TO SAY THE GOOD NEWS IS THE PEOPLE THAT WERE WOUNDED ARE\nNOW ALL OUT OF THE HOSPITAL AND DOING OKAY.\nTHAT'S THE ONE GOOD THING WE HAVE THAT VERY MUCH GRATEFUL FOR\nTHAT. THANK YOU, DEBORAH IN NEW YORK.\n>> ALL OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS COME AFTER ANOTHER INCIDENT IN\nNEW JERSEY ON SATURDAY. THIS WAS AN EXPLOSION IN A TRASH\nCAN.

THIS IS NEW YORK'S FIFTH AVENUE.\nTHIS HAS BEEN OPEN TO TRAFFIC. YOU CAN SEE THE PEDESTRIANS, THE\nVEHICLES STOPPED AT LIGHT HERE. TAKE A LOOK AT 23rd STREET,\nWHICH IS RIGHT BEHIND ME. YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS AREA IS\nTILL SEALED OFF. ABOUT A BLOCK AND A HALF DOWN\nTHE STREET. IT IS STILL AN ACTIVE CRIME\nSCENE.

BUT THIS BLAST COULD HAVE BEEN\nDEADLY. THE EXPLOSIVE DEVICE WAS FOUND\nIN OR NEAR A DUMPSTER. AUTHORITIES SAY IT DID EXTENSIVE\nDAMAGE TO NEARBY BUILDINGS, SHATTERING WINDOWS, EVEN SENDING\nA CHANDELIER CRASHING TO THE FLOOR.\nTHEN THREE HOURS LATER, THERE WAS A DEVICE FOUND FOUR BLOCKS\nNORTH OF HERE. ACCORDING TO PUBLISHED REPORTS,\nIT WAS A PRESSURE COOKER WITH A CELL PHONETA .CHATED\nNE  GOVERNOR AND ROW CUOMO\nSAYS THE PRESSURE COOKER DEVICE RESEMBLED THE DEVICE THAT\nACTUALLY EXPLODED. GOVERNOR CUOMO JOINED BY NEW\nYORK MAYOR BILL de BLASIO JUST A FEW MOMENTS AGO TOURED THE SITE.\nHERE'S WHAT GOVERNOR CUOMO SAID A SHORT TIME EARLIER ABOUT A\nPOSSIBLE MOTIVE. >> A BOMB EXPLODING IN NEW YORK\nIS OBVIOUSLY AN ACT OF TERRORISM, BUT IT'S NOT LINKED\nTO INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. IN OTHER WORDS, WE FIND NO ISIS\nCONNECTION, ET CETERA. BUT A BOMB GOING OFF IS\nGENERICALLY A TERRORIST ACTIVITY.\n>> Reporter: AND NOW ANOTHER PIECE OF THE PUZZLE.\nEARLY SATURDAY MORNING, A PIPE BOMB EXPLODED IN SEASIDE PARK,\nNEW JERSEY, AT A CHARITY EVENT FOR MARINES AND SAILORS.\nGOVERNOR CUOMO SAID THIS DEVICE, A PIPE BOMB, APPEARED TO BE VERY\nDIFFERENT THAN THE TWO DEVICES THAT WERE FOUND HERE IN NEW YORK\nCITY. ALL THREE OF THEM NOW BEING SENT\nFOR EXAMINATION TO AN FBI LAB. LASTLY, NEW YORKERS REMAIN ON\nEDGE. THERE HAVE BEEN AT LEAST A\nCOUPLE REPORTS, FALSE ALARMS OF SUSPICIOUS OBJECTS THAT HAVE\nBEEN FOND. AUTHORITIES IN AND AROUND THIS\nNEIGHBORHOOD HAVE BEEN POSTING SIGNS, OFFERING AS MUCH AS $2500\nFOR TIPS LEADING TO INFORMING THAT HELPS STOP A CRIME.\nWE EXPECT TO GET A GREAT DEAL MORE INFORMING WHEN A NEWS\nCONFERENCE BEGINS WITH BILL DE  THEY HAVE IN THE IDENTIFIEDIN\nYET AS POSSIBLE SUSPECT.

ERIC?\n>> NOW TO FRESH CONCERNS CONCERNING TERRORISM IN THE\nHEARTLAND. IN MINNESOTA, MEDIA CLAIMED THAT\nKNIFE-WIELDING SUSPECT THAT WENT ON A STABBING FREE AT A MALL,\nISIS CLAIMS HE WAS, QUOTE A SOLDIER OF THE ISLAMIC STATE.\nTHIS AS THE FBI IS NOW ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THE INVESTIGATION\nTHERE. DAN SPRINGER IS FOLLOWING THE\nSTORY FROM LOS ANGELES. HI, DAN.\n>> Reporter: YEAH, HEY, ERIC. IT WAS JUST WITHIN THE LAST HOUR\nTHAT ISLAMIC STATE CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK IN\nST. CLOUD. THE ISIS NEWS AGENCY PUT OUT A\nSTATEMENT SAYING THE EXECUTER OF THE ATTACKS IN MINNESOTA\nYESTERDAY WAS A SOLDIER OF THE ISLAMIC STATE AND CARRIED OUT\nTHE OPERATION IN RESPONSE TO CALLS TO TARGET CITIZENS OF\nCOUNTRIES BELONGING TO THE CRUSADER COALITION.\nNOW, THE FBI IS INVOLVED IN THE INVESTIGATION, AS YOU SAID, BUT\nTHEY HAVE NOT YET LABELED THIS AS AN ACT OF TERRORISM.\nALL SIGNS ARE POINTING IN THAT DIRECTION.\nOF COURSE, THE ATTACKER WHOSE NAME HAS NOT BEEN RELEASED, WAS\nRIGHT IN A BUSY SECK OF THE CROSSROADS MALL IN ST. CLOUD,\nWHICH IS ABOUT AN HOUR FROM MINNEAPOLIS.\nHE WAS DRESSED LIKE A PRIVATE SECURITY OFFICER, HAD A KNIFE,\nAND JUST STARTED STABBING PEOPLE.\nACCORDING TO POLICE, HE SEEMED TO BE TARGETING NON-MUSLIMS.\n>> AT PRKLY 8:00, AN ARMED SUSPECT ENTERED THE CROSSROADS\nMALL. THAT INDIVIDUAL MADE SOME\nREFERENCES TO ALLAH. WE HAVE CONFIRMED HE ASKED AT\nLEAST ONE PERSON IF THEY WERE MUSLIM BEFORE HE ASSAULTED THEM.\n>> Reporter: EIGHT PEOPLE WERE INJURED.\nFORTUNATELY, NONE OF THE INJURIES ARE LIFE THREATENING.\nSEVEN OF THE EIGHT HAVE ALREADY BEEN RELEASED.\nPOLICE EVENTUALLY SHOT AND KILLED THE ATTACKER, WHOSE NAME\nHAS NOT BEEN RELEASED. WE SHOULD BE HEARING MORE FROM\nPOLICE TODAY. RIGHT NOW THE MALL REMAINS SHUT\nDOWN AS A CRIME SCENE. THIS HAPPENED JUST MONTHS AFTER\nTHREE SOMALI MEN WERE CONVICTED ON TERROR CHARGES IN\nMINNEAPOLIS. SIX OTHER MUSLIMS PLED GUILTY.\nTHE ARREST WERE PART OF A FEDERAL EFFORT CALLED COUNTERING\nVIOLENT EXTREMISM. AT TIME, THE FBI SAID THE LARGE\nSOMALI COMMUNITY IN MINNEAPOLIS HAD BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY\nRECRUITED BY TERRORIST RECRUITERS.\nAGAIN, WE EXPECT TO HEAR MORE FROM THE FBI AND LOCAL\nAUTHORITIES LATER TODAY. ERIC?\n>> ALL RIGHT, DAN. WE'LL BE WAITING FOR THAT NEWS\nCONFERENCE. OF COURSE, WE'LL BRING IT TO YOU\nLIVE HERE ON THE FOX NEWS CHANNEL.\nTHANK YOU. >> MEANWHILE, WE'RE GOING TO BE\nWAITING FOR THAT NEWS CONFERENCE WITH MAYOR de BLASIO.\nWE HAVE REACTION ON THAT EXPLOSION IN NEW YORK CITY.\nBOTH DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON WEIGHING IN ON THE BLAST\nIN DIFFERENT WAYS. ELIZABETH PRAN IS LIVE IN\nWASHINGTON WITH THAT PART OF THE STORY.\n>> Reporter: YOU'RE RIGHT. THE CAN DID THES AND THEIR\nSURROGATES AND RUNNING MATES ARE GETTING PUSHED TO REACT.\nWHAT THEY'RE DOING SIMILARLY IS CRITICIZING EACH OTHER.\nWE HEARD FIRST FROM DONALD TRUMP.\nHE SPOKE IN COLORADO IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE NEWS BROKE, CALLING\nTHE EXPLOSION A BOMB. HIS REACTION IS GETTING PRAISE\nFROM HIS SUPPORTERS. >> BOY, WE ARE LIVING IN A TIME.\nWE BETTER GET VERY TOUGH, FOLKS. WE BETTER GET VERY, VERY TOUGH.\nJUST HAPPENED, SO WE'LL FIND OUT, BUT IT'S A TERRIBLE THEY\nTHINK GOING ON IN OUR WORLD AND IN OUR COUNTRY.\nAND WE ARE GOING TO GET TOUGH AND SMART AND VIGILANT.\n>> I THINK WHAT DONALD DID WAS PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE TO TELL\nTHAT GROUP OF COLORADO SPRINGS THAT A BOMB HAD EXPLODED.\nTHIS IS TYPICAL MRS. CLINTON. SHE HAS ABSOLUTELY NO BASIS TO\nBE CRITICAL OF WHAT HE DID YESTERDAY.\nBUT SINCE HER CAMPAIGN IS ONLY BASED UPON THAT, THAT'S THE\nONLY, YOU KNOW, ISSUE SHE COULD GO TO.\n>> Reporter: LET'S GO TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE.\nWE SAW HILLARY CLINTON RESPOND DIFFERENTLY AS THE CAN IT THE\nTOLD REPORTERS MORE INFORMATION IS NEEDED BEFORE SHE RESPONDED.\nSHE WAS PRAISE BID HER RUNNING MATE AFTER THOSE COMMENTS WERE\nMADE ABOARD HER AIRPLANE. >> I THINK IT'S ALWAYS WISER TO\nWAIT UNTIL YOU HAVE INFORMATION BEFORE MAKING CONCLUSIONS\nBECAUSE WE ARE JUST IN THE BEGINNING STAGES OF TRYING TO\nDETERMINE WHAT HAPPENED. >> THE MAIN FEELING WE HAVE IS\nCONCERN FOR THE VICTIMS, AND FOR AN EXPLOSION OF THAT SIZE, THE\nFACT THERE ARE NO FATALITIES YET IS POSITIVE.\nIN TERMS OF THE DETAILS, IT'S UNCLEAR.\nAND I KNOW EVERYONE IS LOOKING TO SEE WHAT THE CAUSE WAS.\nCOULD IT POTENTIALLY BE CONNECTED TO TERRORISM?\nNO EVIDENCE YET, BUT I KNOW THAT'S GOING TO BE LOOKED AT\nVERY, VERY CLOSELY. >> Reporter: WE OFTEN SEE BOTH\nCANDIDATES HEAD TO TWITTER. DONALD TRUMP WRITING IN PART,\nI'D LIKE TO EXPRESS MY WARMEST REGARDS AND CONDOLENCES TO ALL\nOF THE FAMILIES AND VICTIMS OF THE HORRIBLE BOMBING IN NYC.\nWE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY UPDATES TO CLINTON'S TWITTER FEED JUST YET.\n>> THANKS SO MUCH, ELIZABETH. NOW LET'S BRING IN STEVE ROGERS,\nFORMER MEMBER OF THE FBI'S JOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCE AND RETIRED\nLIEUTENANT COMMANDER FROM THE OFFICE OF NAVAL INTELLIGENCE.\nGOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE ON THIS BUSY MORNING.\nSO MANY QUESTIONS. I WANT TO START HERE, THAT\nTHEY'RE GOING TO BE SENDING, I GUESS, PIECE OF THAT PRESSURE\nCOOKER THAT CAUSE THE THE EXPLOSION ON WEST 23rd STREET IN\nCHELSEA TO QUANTICO, THE FBI LAB IN VIRGINIA.\nWHAT COULD THEY BE LOOKING FOR? I UNDERSTAND THEY'RE LOOKING FOR\nFORENSICS. >> THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE THE\nBOMB FRAGMENTS FROM WHAT OCCURRED IN NEW JERSEY, THE\nFRAGMENTS AND EVIDENCE THEY GATHERED IN NEW YORK, AND\nTHEY'RE GOING TO MAKE A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS TO SEE IF\nTHERE'S ANY CONNECTION TO THOSE THINGS.\nI'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, WE ARE UNDER ATTACK.\nNEW YORK, NEW JERSEY, MINNESOTA. WHEN I SAY WE, IN THE\nINTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, HAVE SAID ALL ALONG THE BATTLEFIELD\nWAS GOING TO BE MOVED FROM THE MIDDLE EAST TO THE STREETS OF\nTHE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE DON'T NEED POLITICIANS WHO\nARE POLITICALLY CORRECT AND ARE GOING TO GIVE US SANITIZED\nEXPLANATIONS TO EXPLAIN TO US WE'RE NOT UNDER ATTACK.\nWE SEE IT, WE BELIEVE IT, AND NOW AS DONALD TRUMP SAID, WE\nHAVE TO BE VIGILANT. RVELT STEVE, TELL ME WHAT THAT\nMEANS, IF YOU'RE SAYING THAT WE, THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY,\nYOU'RE SAYING THAT WE ARE RND ATTACK.\nTHAT IS THE SENTIMENT AMONGST YOUR COLLEAGUES.\nWHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN TERMS OF HOW WE FIGHT THIS FIGHT AGAINST\nTERRORISM? >> TO BEGIN WITH, OBVIOUSLY\nTHERE WILL HAVE TO BE A STRONG MILITARY RESPONSE IN THE\nMID-EAST WHERE COMMAND AND CONTROL HEADQUARTERS ARE.\nCUT THEM OFF AT THE HEAD. SECONDLY, MORE IMPORTANT IN THE\nHOMELAND, THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY HAS TO START\nFUNDING LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND GIVE THESE OFFICERS IN EVERY\nPOLICE DEPARTMENT ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO\nCOLLECT AND GATHER INTELLIGENCE. THAT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT.\n>> OKAY. MEANWHILE, GOVERNOR CUOMO,\nGOVERNOR OF NEW YORK, SAID THIS MORNING AT A PRESS CONFERENCE\nTHAT 1,000 STATE POLICE OFFICERS AS WELL AS NATIONAL GUARD FORCES\nWILL BE DEPLOYED HERE IN NEW YORK CITY, SEARCHING, YOU KNOW,\nBUS TERMINAL, SEARCHING THE SUBWAY STATIONS.\nOBVIOUSLY THE TRASH CANS AND THINGS LIKE THAT ACROSS THE\nCITY. HOW DOES THIS HELP THE\nINVESTIGATION HERE IN NEW YORK CITY AT PRESENT?\n>> WELL, BASICALLY IT'LL HELP THIS INVESTIGATION IF THEY FIND\nANYTHING ELSE AND GRAB THAT EVIDENCE BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE\nHAPPENS. YOU COULD SEND THOUSANDS OF\nPEOPLE INTO THE CITY, LAW ENFORCEMENT PEOPLE, TO LOOK\nAROUND AND TO SEARCH. WE'VE GOT START THINKING ABOUT\nFIGHTING THIS WAR FROM AN INTELLIGENCE GATHERING\nMETHODOLOGY. THIS IS THE ONLY WAY WE'RE\nGOING TO PREVENT A NUMBER OF ATTACKS\nFROM OCCURRING. >> IN TERMS OF COLLECTING DATA\nFROM THE INTELLIGENCE STANDPOINT, WHAT'S GOING RIGHT,\nBUT WHAT'S MISSING AS WELL? >> WELL, A COUPLE THINGS ARE\nMISSING. FIRST OF ALL, THE NEW YORK CITY\nPOLICE DEPARTMENT, BEST IN THE WORLD.\nTHEY'RE DOING A GREAT JOB. NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.\nWHAT'S MISSING IS GIVING LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS AROUND THE\nCOUNTRY THE TRAINING THEY NEED TO SHARE WITH THEM WHAT TO LOOK\nFOR, WHAT TO GATHER, WHAT TO SEND UP THE CHAIN.\nWE ALSO NEED THIS. AND I GOT A LOT OF HEAT FOR\nSAYING THIS, BUT WE NEED TO GIVE THE NSA POWER BACK THAT THEY\nNEED IN ORDER TO TAP INTO A LOT OF CHATTER THAT'S GOING ON\nAROUND THE WORLD. DON'T FORGET, THE WHITE HOUSE\nHAS RESTRICTED THEM TO SOME DEGREE TO DOING THE JOB THEY\nNEED TO DO TO PREVENT ANOTHER ATTACK.\n>> ALL RIGHT, STEVE. I HAVE MORE QUESTIONS.\nSTAND BY AS WE AWAIT THIS NEWS CONFERENCE FROM MAYOR BILL de\nBLASIO. WE'LL GET MORE DETAILS FROM THAT\nPRESSER. WE'LL BRING IT TO YOU LIVE WHEN\nIT HAPPENS. MEANWHILE, ERIC --\n>> YOU KNOW, FROM THE SPREE OF TERRORIST BOMBINGS AND THE\nWEATHER UNDERGROUND REVOLUTION\nREVOLUTIONARIES, THERE WAS THE BOMBINGQUARTERS IN 1982.\nA BOMBING AT LAGARDE WHY AIRPORT IN 1975.\nTHAT'S WHEN TERRORISTS PUT A BOMB ACTUALLY IN A LOCKER, A\nBAGGAGE LOCKER AT LaGUARDIA AIRPORT.\nIT EXPLODED. 11 PEOPLE WERE KILLED.\nTHIS IS WHAT WE WENT THROUGH IN THIS COUNTRY FOR YEARS. 4,000 BOMBINGS IN 1969 ACROSS\nOUR COUNTRY. SEVERAL HUNDRED A YEAR JUST IN\nNEW YORK CITY. OF COURSE, THERE WAS THE MAD\nBOMBER BACK IN THE '50s WHO SET OFF 33 BOMBS AND KILLED --\nINJURED, NOT KILLED, 16 PEOPLE. WE'VE HAD THIS FOR YEARS.\nNOW SOME ARE WONDERING AND QUESTIONING IF WE'VE RETURNED TO\nA SPATE OF NEW TERRORIST BOMBINGS WITH THIS PRESSURE\nCOOKER AGAIN. >> ERIC, I'LL PICK UP THERE WITH\nSTEVE. AS WE AWAITED THIS PRESSER, I\nMAY HAVE TO JUMP IN.",

THANKFULLY THE RACE HAD NOT\nSTARTED. IT WAS DELAYED, SO NO ONE WAS\nHURT. IT WAS A CHARITY RACE, A 5K RUN\nBENEFITTING MARINES. NO ONE WAS HURT THERE.\nTHEN YOU HAVE THIS INCIDENT AT THE CROSSROADS MALL IN\nMINNESOTA, WHERE ISIS HAS NOW CLAIMED THAT THE STABBER AT THAT\nMALL WAS INSPIRED BY THEM, CALLING THE PERPETRATOR THE\nSOLDIER OF THE ISLAMIC STATE. SO WHY IS IT THE LABELING\nIMPORTANT IN TERMS OF PERHAPS FIENDING OUT IF THESE THINGS\nWERE CONNECTED OR THEY WERE ISOLATED INCIDENTS?\n>> IT'S IMPORTANT IT SEE IF THEY WERE CONNECTED.\nAPP REREHENDING AN INDIVIDUAL AND APPREHENDING HIM QUICKLY\nWILL PROBABLY GIVE YOU A MOTIVE. YOU GOT THE BEST LAW ENFORCEMENT\nAGENCY IN THE WORLD. I BELIEVE THEY'RE GOING TO\nAPPREHEND THE INDIVIDUAL. YOU NEED O INTERVIEW THAT\nINDIVIDUAL, AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU THE MOTIVE.\nYOU ASKED THE QUESTION, WHY THOSE LOCATIONS.\nMANY TIMES, AND I'VE LEARNED THIS FROM THE AL QAEDA TRAINING\nMANUAL YEARS AGO, THEY WILL PROBABLY FOR A GREATER AND A\nMORE INTENSE ATTACK. WHY THESE LOCATIONS?\nA LITTLE PUZZLING, BUT THEY COULD BE PROBING.\nTHEY COULD BE LOOKING AT RESPONSE TIME, HOW MANY PEOPLE\nARE GOING TO RESPOND, WHO'S GOING TO RESPOND.\nSO AT THIS POINT, CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO APPREHEND THE\nINDIVIDUAL OR INDIVIDUALS WHO COMMITTED THIS ACT.\n>> STEVE ROGERS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE WITH US.\nERIC, AS I TOSS IT OVER TO YOU, I TALKED TO YOU LAST NIGHT.\nI TOLD YOU HOW I WAS JUST THERE BLOCKS AWAY FROM THAT EXPLOSION.\nI FELT IT PIM HEARD IT. I WAS JUST ABOUT THREE BLOCKS\nAWAY. IT WAS PRETTY, YOU KNOW,\nUNNERVING, BUT AGAIN, NEW YORKERS, WE STAY STRONG, RESTAY\nRESILIENT AND MOVE FORWARD. THIS IS DEFINITELY A CONCERNING\nINCIDENT. >> THAT IS ASTOUNDING.\nAND AN INDICATION, I THINK, OF HOW TERRORISM, NO MATTER WHAT\nIT'S FROM, AFFECTS ALL OF US IN THIS COUNTRY IN SUCH A PERSONAL\nWAY.",

AT FIRST BLUSH THESE ARE\nDIFFERENT DEVICES. BUT A BIT OF A COINCIDENCE IT'S\nTHE SAME DAY AND SAME GENERAL VICINITY, GEOGRAPHICALLY, THAT\nSECTION OF THE COUNTRY. WHAT KIND OF LINKS WOULD YOU BE\nLOOKING FOR OR SOMETHING THAT WOULD RULE OUT A LINK?\n>> WELL, YOU MAKE SOME GOOD POINTS THERE, SHANNON, AND A\nCOUPLE OF THINGS ON THIS. FIRST, AS A FORMER FEDERAL\nINVESTIGATOR THAT'S BEEN INVOLVED IN THESE JOINT TERROR\nCASES, YOU WOULD ALMOST PREFER THE SEASIDE INCIDENT AND\nMAINTAIN INCIDENT WERE LINKED, BECAUSE IT WOULD BE ONE\nCOLLECTIVE BODY OR CELL OF TERRORISTS.\nIT'S EVEN MORE DISTURBING, THINK ABOUT THIS, YOUR VIEWERS HERE,\nIF YOU HAD TWO INDEPENDENT OPERATORS OPERATING IN NEW\nJERSEY AND NEW YORK, HAVING NOTHING TO DO WITH ONE ANOTHER,\nWHO MAY, WE DON'T KNOW YET THE MOTIVATION, BUT MAY HAVE BEEN\nMOTIVATED BY SOME TYPE OF TERRORIST PROPAGANDA, THAT'S A\nFRIGHTENING PROPOSAL, BUT WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING FOR?\nONE OF THE POSITIVES TO TAKE FROM THIS IS THEY GOT THE SECOND\nDEVICE BEFORE IT EXPLODED IN MANHATTAN AND EVERY DEVICE HAS A\nSIGNATURE, THE WAY IT'S CONSTRUCTED.\nTHERE MAY BE CLUES IN THAT, THAT COULD LINK THE TWO OR NOT.\n>> THERE HAS BEEN ONE REPORT, I'VE HEARD, MULTIPLE REPORTS,\nTHERE MAY HAVE BEEN A CELL PHONE CONNECTED TO THAT SECOND DEVICE\nTHAT DID NOT DETONATE. HOW VALUABLE COULD THAT BE?\n>> OH, THAT'S EXTREMELY VALUABLE, BECAUSE ALL THESE CELL\nPHONES HAVE ESNs, ELECTRONIC SERIAL NUMBERS, MOBILE\nIDENTIFICATION NUMBERS. IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO\nCOMPLETELY WIPE FREE AN EVIDENCE PATHWAY FROM WHERE THAT CELL\nPHONE WAS ACQUIRED. EVEN IF IT'S SOMETHING LIKE A\nCRICKET PHONE, LIKE A ONE-TIME USE, IT'S STILL POSSIBLE TO\nTRACK WHERE IT WAS SENT AND WHERE IT WAS SOLD AND THESE\nSTORES NOW HAVE SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS AND THINGS LIKE THAT, SO\nIT MAY CREATE SOME COMPLICATIONS IF IT'S A ONE-TIME THROW-AWAY\nPHONE, BUT IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO TRACK AT ALL.\nNOT LIKE A DOLLAR BILL WHICH PASSES THROUGH THOUSANDS OF\nHANDS BEFORE IT WINDS UP AT ITS END POINT.\n>> ALL OF US WHO SPEND TIME IN NEW YORK KNOW THERE ARE CAMERAS\nEVERYWHERE. THEY ARE ON BUILDINGS, THEY ARE\nON BUSINESSES, THEY ARE INSIDE BUSINESSES, OUTSIDE BUSINESSES.\nHOW HELPFUL DO YOU THINK THAT WILL BE IN HELPING TO BACKTRACK\nFROM THE EXPLOSION AND THE SECOND SITE WHERE THE DEVICE,\nTHE I.E.D., THE BOMB, DIDN'T GO OFF, WAS POSSIBLY PLANTED THE\nHOURS AHEAD OF THESE DISCOVERIES?\n>> RIGHT. YEAH, THAT'S A GREAT POINT YOU\nMAKE THERE. NOW, ONE OF THE DOWNSIDES TO THE\nCAMERAS BEING IN MANHATTAN IS, OBVIOUSLY, THE POPULATION\nDENSITY OF MANHATTAN IS OFF THE CHARTS.\nSO IF THIS WAS, SAY, A RURAL TOWN, YOU KNOW, SOMEWHERE UP IN\nNEW HAMPSHIRE OR WHEREVER IT MAY BE AND YOU HAD A NETWORK OF\nCAMERAS AROUND, YOU COULD PROBABLY TRACK EVERY SINGLE CAR\nTHAT DROVE ON TO AN AREA IN THAT SMALL TOWN EASILY.\nIT'S NOT THAT EASY IN MANHATTAN, BUT, SHANNON, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY\nRIGHT, THE NETWORK OF PRIVATE CAMERAS, OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE CELL\nPHONES WHO WERE TAKING SELFIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND NYPD\nCAMERAS, YOU CAN PROBABLY PUT TOGETHER IF YOU HAD A LOT OF\nPEOPLE WORKING ON IT A REALLY SOLID PICTURE OF JUST ABOUT\nEVERY PERSON AND EVERY CAR THAT TRAVERSED THE AREA AROUND THAT\nBOMB ATTACK. IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT\nOF WORK, BUT IT CAN DEFINITELY BE DONE.\nTHAT NETWORK OF CAMERAS IS PRETTY EXTENSIVE.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT KEEPS COMING UP AND JEH\nJOHNSON JUST RECENTLY TALKING ABOUT IT AGAIN, THIS ISSUE OF\nLONE WOLVES. RIGHT NOW AUTHORITIES ARE SAYING\nNO CONNECTION WITH ISIS, WE DON'T SEE ANYTHING, BUT DOES IT\nMATTER IF THERE'S A FORMAL CONNECTION?\nBECAUSE WE SEE THESE MAGAZINES THAT GO OUT FROM TERRORIST\nORGANIZATIONS THAT BASICALLY SHOW YOU HOW TO BUILD THESE\nBOMBS, USE HOUSEHOLD GOODS AND PUT THINGS TOGETHER TO HARM\nOTHERS. DOES IT MATTER IF THERE'S A\nFORMAL LINK AND HOW MUCH TOUGHER DOES IT MAKE IT FOR PEOPLE WHO\nDO THE JOB YOU DO, TO DO THAT JOB?\n>> I'M GLAD YOU'VE ASKED THAT, BECAUSE I'VE BEEN ON YOUR\nNETWORK FOR A LONG TIME TALKING ABOUT THE LONE WOLF ATTACK IS\nWHAT HORRIFIES AND TERRORIZES ME.\nYOU ALMOST WANT A FORMAL CONNECTION TO ISIS OR AL QAEDA,\nSHANNON, BECAUSE THAT FORMAL CONNECTION CREATES INVESTIGATIVE\nFINGERPRINTS AND BREAD CRUMBS FOR THOSE TO TRACK.\nWHEN YOU HAVE THESE LONE WOLF OPERATORS OUT THERE, WHO ARE\nSITTING IN FRONT OF THE COMPUTER AND BECOMING INSPIRED BY THIS\nSICK PROPAGANDA ON THE INTERNET, ON SOCIAL MEDIA PUT OUT THERE BY\nAL QAEDA AND ISIS, THOSE INVESTIGATIVE FOOTPRINTS LARGELY\nDISAPPEAR. THAT MAN OR WOMAN IS SITTING IN\nTHEIR APARTMENT AND THE CHANCES OF YOUR FINDING THEM ARE SLIM TO\nNONE. WHEN THEY ARE TRAVELING\nOVERSEAS, THEY ARE GETTING TRAINING, GETTING BACK ON A\nPLANE, THEY ARE AVAILABLE IN TEXT, ONE OF OUR SYSTEMS TO\nCHECK PEOPLE THAT TRAVEL OVERSEAS, WE CAN INTERCEPT THEM\nAND HOPEFULLY STOP THE TERRORIST ATTACK.\nTHE LONE WOLF ATTACKS ARE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO STOP AND\nTHEY DON'T COST ANYTHING AND REQUIRE ALMOST NO TRAINING TO\nIMPLEMENT, SADLY. >> THAT'S WHY WE ARE GRATEFUL\nFOR FOLKS WHO HAVE SERVED LIKE YOU AND THOSE IN THE\nINTELLIGENCE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY WHO ARE WORKING DAY\nAND NIGHT TO PROTECT US FROM THESE THINGS.\nDAN BOGNINO, THANK YOU.",

HAS ANYONE CLAIMED\nRESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACKS IN NEW JERSEY AND NEW YORK,\nPETER, THE WAY WE'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN SO FAR IN MINNESOTA?\n>> THERE HAS NOT, HARRIS, BEEN AN OFFICIAL CLAIM OF\nRESPONSIBILITY. BUT THERE HAS BEEN A THREAT OF\nMORE BOMBINGS BY SOMEBODY WHO PLACED A VERY SUSPICIOUS 911\nCALL HERE IN NEW YORK MINUTES AFTER THE FIRST EXPLOSION.\nWE HEARD -- WE FIRST HEARD ABOUT THIS CALL FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT\nSOURCES LAST NIGHT. NOW THE NEW YORK POST IS\nREPORTING THAT THE CALLER SAID, IN PART THAT, QUOTE, I'M LOOKING\nAT THE EXPLOSION DOWN THE BLOCK. THERE WILL BE MORE.\nAND WE ARE TOLD THERE IS A LOT OF VIDEO SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE\nFROM THE AREA WHERE THE BOMBS WERE PLANTED AND THERE IS MORE\nEVIDENCE AUTHORITIES HAVE THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT THEY\nARE TRYING TO KEEP IT QUIET AS NOT TO TIP OFF ANY POTENTIAL\nSUSPECTS. AT THIS HOUR, THOUGH, THEY ARE\nNOT RULING OUT ANYTHING. >> WE DON'T KNOW WHAT -- IF\nTHERE IS ANY POLITICAL OR SOCIAL MEDVATION BUT WE DEFINITELY HAD\nA BOMBING LAST NIGHT AT 23rd STREET AND WE HAD A SUSPICIOUS\nDEVICE ON 27th STREET. >> Reporter: THE MAYOR BILL DE\nBLASIO THINKS IT IS STILL TOO SOON TO KNOW IF THIS IS\nMOTIVATED BY A PERSONAL PROBLEM. BUT THE GOVERNOR ANDREW CUOMO, A\nLOT MORE DIRECT. HE SAID ANY TIME A BOMB EXPLODES\nIN NEW YORK CITY, IT IS TERRORISM AND JUST TO BE SAFE,\nTO MAKE SURE THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN AGAIN, OR AT LEAST TO\nMAKE IT HARDER FOR SOMEBODY TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT AGAIN,\nTHE GOVERNOR CUOMO IS DEPLOYING THE NATIONAL GUARD TO SOME\nTRANSIT HUBS STARTING TOMORROW. HARRIS.\n>> YOU TALK ABOUT JUST HOW PEOPLE FEEL AND THE SAFETY\nFACTOR AND ALL OF THAT. THOSE MOVES LIKE WHAT YOU JUST\nDESCRIBED MEAN A LOT TO PEOPLE HERE BECAUSE YOU HAVE SO MANY\nGATHERED ON THIS LAST WEEKEND OF THE SUMMER.\nHOW MANY HAVE INVESTIGATORS, PETER, BEEN ABLE TO LEARN ABOUT\nTHE DOM BOMBER FROM -- THE BOMBER FROM THE DEVICES LEFT\nBEHIND. >> THE SECOND DE -- DEVICE IS\nSOMETHING THEY LOOKED AT. AND FINALLY THIS AFTERNOON THEY\nDESTROYED IT IN A CONTROLLED DEMOLITION AT A FACILITY BUT\nTHEY HAD A LONG TIME TO LOOK AT IT AND FORENSIC EXPERTS ARE\nTELLING US THAT AUTHORITIES SHOULD BE ABLE TO LEARN A LOT\nFROM THE DEVICE BECAUSE THERE IS HARDLY EVER SUCH A SUBSTANTIAL\nAND IN-TACT PIECE OF EVIDENCE AFTER A BOMBING.\nAND THAT IS THE REASON WHY JIM CAL STROM WHO USED TO RUN THE\nFBI NEW YORK OFFICE DOESN'T THINK IT WILL TAKE VERY LONG FOR\nINVESTIGATORS TO FIGURE OUT WHO THE BOMBER OR BOMBERS ARE.\n>> SO YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT ONE DEVICE AND MANY PIECES AT THE\nDIFFERENT CRIME SCENES.

THERE WAS A REPORT FROM MAED\nGOMEZ WHO SAYS WE'RE AT A LEVEL OF ALERT THAT NEW YORK CITY\nHASN'T SEEN SINCE 9/11. DO YOU AGREE?\n>> SURE. YOU HAVE AN IED GO OFF IN\nMANHATTAN AND A SECOND IED BE DISCOVERED INMAN AND YOU DON'T\nKNOW WITH CERTAINTY WHO DID IT FOR A PERIOD OF HOURS, SO YOU\nCAN UNDERSTAND THAT THIS RACHETS UP WHAT'S GOING ON IN NEW YORK\nCITY AND CERTAINLY IN THE NORTHEAST AFTER THE SEASIDE PARK\nINCIDENT AND NOW IN ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY.\n>> JIM, WHAT'S YOUR REACTION TO ALL OF THIS?\n>> THINK THINK IT'S AMAZING THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS MANAGE TO\nGET A SUSPECT IN PLAY THIS QUICKLY.\nGIVEN THE FACT THAT THE NEW YORK POLICE HAVE BEEN FORCED TO STOP\nDOING SURVEILLANCE IN MOSQUES AND ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THE\nCOMMUNITY IN WHICH THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE OPERATING.\nYOU KNOW, THE SOMALI ATTACKER FROM THE MALL, CAIR, CAME OUT\nWITH A PRESS CONFERENCE YESTERDAY SAID THIS IS JUST AN\nINDIVIDUAL. IT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH\nISLAM. NO, HE'S AN INDIVIDUAL MUSLIM.\nHE'S CONDUCTING JIHAD AND HE'S SAYING ALLAH ABU AKBAR.\nWE NEED OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY TO LOOK AT THESE\nTHINGS BEFORE THESE THINGS HAPPEN.\n>> WHAT DOES IT SAY TO YOU HALF AN HOUR AGO THE FBI SENT OUT\nTHIS PICTURE AND SENT OUT A NOTIFICATION OF AN ALERT ON\nEVERYBODY'S SMART PHONE. LOOK OUT FOR THIS GUY.\nHE CAN BE ARMED AND DANGEROUS. DOES THAT SUGGEST TO YOU THAT HE\nMIGHT HAVE PLANNED SOMETHING THAT COULD BE COMING UP VERY\nSHORTLY? >> NOT NECESSARILY.\nYOU KNOW, IN THESE CASES, AND THE BOSTON MARATHON BOMBING WAS\nANOTHER EXAMPLE OF IT. THERE IS A TENSION GOING ON\nWITHIN THESE ORGANIZATIONS, LAW ENFORCEMENT, TO DETERMINE IS\nTHIS OUR SUBJECT, CAN WE PUT OUR HANDS ON HIM WITH STEALTH VERY QUICKLY, AND IF THE ANSWER TO\nTHAT IS NO, THEN THERE IS A PERCEIVED DUTY AND PERHAPS AN\nABSOLUTE DUTY TO NOTIFY THE PUBLIC AND SAY WE NEED YOUR\nHELP. HERE IS WHO WE'RE LOOKING FOR\nBECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL THAT HE'S OUT THERE RUNNING AROUND\nFOR 12, 24 HOURS A WEEK, AND BRINGING OTHER HARM.\n>> JIM, IF YOU LOOK AT THE FACT THAT THIS IS CHELSEA.\nTHIS ISN'T REALLY NESTLED IN A REMOTE AREA OF NEW YORK CITY.\nTHE FACT THAT IT WAS DONE TWICE IN AN AREA ON A SATURDAY NIGHT,\nWE'RE PRETTY MUCH WELL STOCK. THE FACT THEY ARE TRYING TO HIT\nNORTHERN NEW JERSEY AT THE SAME TIME, THERE MEANING BEHIND THE\nPLACES THEY ARE DOING IT? IS THERE MEANING BEHIND WHAT\nTHEY ARE DOING? THE CHOICE OF BOMB, THE CHOICE\nOF MATERIAL, THE CHOICE OF DETONATION?\nWHY NOT NOW, WHY NOW THEN AND WHY WHERE IT WAS HIT?\n>> THE WHY IS BECAUSE JIHAD IS COMMANDED.\nSO THEY ARE DOING WHAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO DO ACCORDING TO\nRADICAL ISLAM. THE QUESTION ABOUT WHERE AND WHY\nTHOSE PARTICULAR LOCATIONS, CHELSEA IS A PROMINENTLY GAY\nAREA. I THINK THERE'S A DECENT CHANCE\nTHIS MIGHT BE ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO ATTACK A GAY COMMUNITY.\nTHE TRAIN STATION IN NEW JERSEY, MASS TRANSIT IS SOMETHING SO\nMANY PEOPLE USE THAT IT'S A WAY TO STRIKE TERROR AND FEAR AND\nTHE FACT THAT THEY USED PRESSURE COOKERS ALLAH THE BOSTON\nMARATHON BOMBERS, WHO LEARNED THAT FROM AL QAEDA, THEIR\nJIHADIST MAGAZINE. >> WHAT DOES IT TELL YOU ABOUT\nTHE FACT THAT THE FIRST BOMB DID GO OFF IN THE CHELSEA AREA, NO\nONE WAS KILLED, THANK GOODNESS, DOES IT TELL YOU THAT THEY ARE\nLONE WOLVES AND THEY ARE LEARNING HOW TO MAKE THESE ON\nTHEIR OWN? BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T EFFECTIVE?\n>> I SUSPECT THEY HAVE TESTED THESE DEVICES FOR THEIR\nEFFECTIVENESS THAT THERE WAS A DARKER PLOT, CERTAINLY.\nI CANNOT ENVISION THEM WANTING THE SECOND PRESSURE COOKER\nDEVICE UNEXPLODED TO BE RECOVERED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT.\nTHAT GIVES LAW ENFORCEMENT A TREMENDOUS EXPLOITATION\nOPPORTUNITY. LOOK NO FURTHER THAN THE CELL\nPHONE ON TOP, WHERE WAS THAT CELL PHONE PURCHASED.\nWHAT PROVIDER WAS IT? WAS IT -- WAS THERE A CALL TO\nTEST THAT DEVICE, AND THAT CALL GOES RIGHT BACK TO THE PERSON\nWE'RE LOOKING FOR RIGHT NOW. THIS LITTLE DEVICE HERE CAN TELL\nUS A LOT ABOUT A PERSON, ABOUT THEIR NETWORK, ABOUT THEIR\nTACTICS. SO I DON'T THINK THEY INTENDED\nTHAT SECOND ONE NOT TO DETONATE. >> NOT TO WORK.\n>> LET ME ASK YOU THIS, RON, BECAUSE THEY DID PUT APPARENTLY\nIN THE SECOND ONE THEY FOUND BALL BEARINGS AND BBs TO INFLICT\nTHE MAXIMUM SHRAPNEL DAMAGE TO PEOPLE.\nWHY WOULD THEY PUT IT INSIDE A DUMPSTER?\n>> WELL, GOOD QUESTION. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE\nOUT OR LEARN FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT WHY THE ANSWERS.\nMAYBE THEY BELIEVED IT WAS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO CREATE\nADDITIONAL SHRAPNEL FROM THE DUMPSTER EXPLODING AND THAT'S\nGOING TO HAVE THAT EFFECT TOO. YOU SEE WHERE SOME OF THE\nSHRAPNEL PENETRATED THIS DUMPSTER.\nTHE FIRST ONE. >> PEOPLE SAY TOO, EXPERTS IN\nBOMBING I SAYING ONE OF THE BIG DIFFERENCE IS THE DETONATION.\nTHEY DID FLIP PHONES. THE OTHER ONES USED REMOTE\nCONTROL FROM -- BASICALLY REMOTE CONTROLLED CAR.\nTHE OTHER IS THE MATERIAL USED. THE IDIOTS FROM THE BOSTON\nBOMBING USED BLACK POWDER. THESE GUYS USED TANNORITE, WE\nIT'S INTENDED TO DETONATE WHEN SHOT BY HIGH VELOCITY BULLETS,\nWHY WOULD THEY USE THAT TYPE OF MATERIAL AND IS IT EASY TO GET?\n>> I'M CERTAIN THAT THESE GUYS LOOKED AT THEIR TACTICS, PREPPED\nFOR IT, UNDERSTOOD EXACTLY WHAT THEY WERE DOING.\nTHE FBI OVER A DOZEN YEARS AGO STARTED A COMPONENT CALLED THE TDAT.\nIT'S DOWN IN HUNTSVILLE, ALABAMA.\nTHE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN TAKING THIS OFF THE BATTLE FIELD AND\nSTUDYING THEM. TERRORISTS DO THE SAME THING.\n>> WHOEVER DID THIS ALSO USED CHRISTMAS LIGHTS AS THE FUSE AND\nTHAT'S WHAT THE FBI IS LOOKING AT.\nJIM AND RON, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US LIVE.\n>> THANK YOU.",

AND IT WILL GET ANCHORED FURTHER\nINTO NEGATIVE TERRITORY, BUT IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT\nTHEY DO TO HOLD UP THE LONG END. ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS OUT THERE\nIS THAT WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE COMMITMENT TO FISCAL\nSUPPORT. SO MAYBE NOT OFFICIAL\nRECOGNITION OF HELICOPTER MONEY AS SUCH BUT SOMETHING CLOSER TO\nTHAT.

AT THE SAME TIME, WE SORT OF\nREDUCED OUR REGIONAL SECONDS, WE OVERWEIGHT THE UK AND PULLED\nBOTH OF THOSE BACK INTO THE UNDER EMERGING MARKETS IN THE\nU.S. WE ARE BROADLY NEUTRAL OF\nEUROPEAN EQUITIES HERE, BUT SOME OF THE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE LAST\nFEW MONTHS ARE MORE POSITIVE FOR EUROPE.\nAND IN PARTICULAR, WE HAVE THE CENTRAL BANK EASING.\nBUT WE ALSO HAD A SHARP CONTRACTION IN FED WITH\nCORPORATE BORROWING COSTS.

WE HAVE BEEN GROWING 10% EACH\nYEAR ON THOSE BUSINESSES, AND HE WOULD BE VERY STRONG IN THOSE\nAREAS.

WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT\nTHING TO FOCUS ON THIS WEEK? >> WELL, WHICH IS MORE\nIMPORTANT? I GUESS DIRECTLY THE FED.\nTHE CHANCES ARE THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS HOW TO SET US\nUP. YOU SAID EARLIER WE'RE SCRAPING\nTHE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL. WE ARE SCRAPING THE BOTTOM OF\nTHE JAM JAR, IF WE CAN GET ENOUGH JAM FOR A CRUMPET BUT NOT\nFOR A MEAL. >> THAT'S A GREAT BRITISH\nANALOGY THERE. >> WE ARE WORKING HARD TO KEEP\nTHE BRITISH THEME GOING THIS MORNING.\nBUT THE KEY THING FOR ME IS THE SENSE OF THE TEN-YEAR U.S.\nTREASURY YIELDS GOING TO BE HEADING UP TOWARDS 2% OR\nCERTAINLY BACK TOWARDS 1.5%. AND I THINK THAT ANYTHING THE\nFED RESERVE DOES, WHICH MAKES IT CLEAR THAT, YEAH, WE'RE STILL\nGOING HIGHER, YEAH, AS OF THE CENTRAL BANK RUNNING OUT OF\nAMMUNITION, WE THINK THE MARKETS SHOULD BE PRICING IN A MOVE IN\nDECEMBER. I THINK THAT KEEPS BOND MARKETS\nON THE BACK FOOT AND THAT IS WHERE THE DANGER IS FOR RISK\nSENTIMENT RIGHT ACROSS THE WORLD.\n>> IS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT THE FED JUST DOES IT, JUST RAISES\nRATES AND SAYS, YES, THERE IS A TREND WITH IT WEAKENING A BIT,\nBUT THEY ARE STILL POINTING TO A HEALTHY RECOVERY WITH INFLATION\nMOVING TO THE TARGET. UP EMPLOYMENT CONTINUES TO\nIMPROVE AND WE'RE GOING TO RAISE RATES.\n>> YEAH, THE LAST TIME THE FED REALLY SURPRISED MARKETS BY\nRAISING RATES WHEN IT WASN'T EXPECTED WAS IN 1994.\nBUT EVER SINCE THEN IT'S KIND OF BEEN RECEIVED WISDOM FOR FOLKS\nLIKE ME THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO DO THAT AGAIN.\nBUT THIS IS THE MOST CAUTIOUS FOMC SINCE THEN FOR SURE,\nPOSSIBLY FOR EVEN LONGER, I DON'T KNOW.\nSO INCREDIBLY CAUTIOUS. I THINK IT IS MORE LIKELY THAT\nTHEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MARKET IS READY FOR THEM TO\nMOVE, IF THE DANGER IN THE NEXT SIX WEEKS ARE FINE, AND TO GO\nAGAIN BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR RATHER THAN RISK THE REACTION OF\nGOING WHEN THEY HAVEN'T GOT THE MARKET IN THE RIGHT PLACE.\nBUT THIS IS ALL GUESSING AT THIS POINT IN TIME IN TERMS OF THAT.\nBUT IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT IS MORE LIKELY.\n>> KIT, WE HAVE SEEN YIELDS TICK UP ALTHOUGH EXPECTATIONS OF A\nRATE HIKE HAVE BEEN PUSHED BACK, WHAT LEVEL OF YIELDS HAVE WE HIT\nFOR EXAMPLE IN THE TEN-YEAR WOULD YOU START TO GET SERIOUSLY\nWORRIED ON THAT THIS WAS THE BURSTING OF THE BOND BUBBLE IN\nTHE RECENT YEARS? >> WELL, I THINK YOU WOULD HAVE\nTO GET WELL ON THE SIDE OF 2%. IN A SENSE, IT'S NOT -- IT'S NOT\nSO MUCH BURSTING A BUBBLE AT THIS POINT IN TIME, IT'S FATIGUE\nTHAT -- WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO OWN GOVERNMENT BONDS ANYWHERE\nWITH NEGATIVE YIELDS INSTEAD OF PUTTING YOUR MONEY IN CASH?\nWHAT CAN CENTRAL BANKS DO IF WE KNOW THEY WOULD LIKE STEEPER\nYIELD CURVES TO KEEP THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM VIABLE?\nTHOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS WE ASK AROUND.\nGENERALLY, WE SEE THAT THE SUPPORT FOR GLOBAL BOND MARKETS\nIS FADING A LITTLE BIT. IF WHAT WE DO, WE HAVE SEEN THE\nLOW IN TREASURY YIELDS AND THE TEN-YEAR YIELD IS, SOMEWHERE AT\nONE POINT, SOMEWHERE BELOW 2%. BIG DEAL.\nIT'S AN OVERSHOOT SPIKE SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE THAT THAT\nWOULD HAVE MUCH MORE COLLATERAL DAMAGE.\nBUT I DON'T SEE A BIG BEAR MARKET IN BONDS.\nI JUST THINK WE HAVE SEEN THE LOW IN YIELDS FOR QUITE A LONG\nTIME. >> WHAT ABOUT THE DOLLAR?\nWHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE DOLLAR, ARE YOU BUYING IT INTO THE FED\nMEETING WHETHER OR NOT THEY RAISE RATES SEPTEMBER, DECEMBER\nOR MAYBE EARLY NEXT YEAR? >> YEAH, I THINK THE DOLLAR,\nWHICH HAS BEEN LARGELY MOVING SIDEWALKS AGAINST THE EURO AND\nYEN FOR MONTHS NOW, WHICH HAS LOST GROUND OVER THE SUMMER, ALL\nTHOSE LAZY, THOSE COMFORTABLE EASY CARRY TRADES THAT WE SAW AS\nPEOPLE WERE HUNTING YIELD OVER THE SUMMER.\nI THINK WE CAN STILL UNWIND MORE OF THAT IF MARKETS ARE\nENCOURAGED TO PRICE IN A RATE HIKE DOWN THE ROAD WITH MORE\nCONVICTION. I THINK THOSE TRENDS CAN BE\nTAKEN OFF AS PEOPLE TAKE BETS OFF.\nA MUCH SHARPER DOLLAR MOVE SEEMS UNLIKELY AT THIS POINT, WE'RE\nNOT -- WE'RE FINE-TUNING A FED STORY AND WE'RE TRYING TO COPE\nWITH THE END OF THE CYCLE IN MONETARY POLICY OVER THE BANK OF\nJAPAN. >> KIT, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US\nTHIS MORNING. MUCH APPRECIATED.\nKIT JUCKES.",

AND AHEAD OF A VERY BIG CENTRAL\nBANK DECISION FROM THE FED, JOINING US FROM CHARLOTTE IS\nJOHN SILVIA AT WELLS FARGO SECURITY.\nGOOD MORNING TO YOU, JOHN. >> Reporter: GOOD MORNING.\n>> IS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT THE FED COULD PULL A RATE HIKE\nSURPRISE THIS WEEK? >> A VERY SMALL CHANCE.\nI THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION AND RETAIL\nSALES NUMBERS LAST WEEK, THEY WERE KIND OF DISAPPOINTING.\nTHIS WEEK WE SEE BETTER HOUSING DATA.\nAND OVERALL, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OVERALL FLOW OF THE ECONOMY,\nDOMESTIC SALES IS PRETTY GOOD. INFLATION IS CREEPING UP.\nBUT THERE IS REALLY NO INCENTIVE TO MOVE QUITE YET, ESPECIALLY IN\nFRONT OF AN ELECTION. >> JOHN, WHAT CAN WE EXPECT THEN\nIN TERMS OF MARKETS BETWEEN NOW AND SAY DECEMBER, THE NEXT\nMEETING WHEN THIS WILL BE A QUESTION AGAIN?\nBECAUSE WE SAW A LOT OF ROTATION IN THE SUMMER EXPECTING A HIKE,\nAND NOW THAT IS A DRAWN LINE AGAIN.\n>> YEAH, THAT IS ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF BEING SO DATA\nDEPENDENT ON SHORT-RUN DATA. SO YOU GET THIS ROLLER COASTER\nOF VOLATILITY AS SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY, BUT THAT WOULD BE MY\nEXPECTATION IN THE MARKETPLACE FOR THE REST OF THIS YEAR.\nPLUS, THE SENSE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET SLIGHTLY BETTER\nECONOMIC DATA THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.\nSO MAYBE TEN-YEAR YIELDS MOVE UP A LITTLE BIT.\nAND THEN FINALLY BEYOND THE FED, LOOK AT THE BANK OF JAPAN THIS\nWEEK. YOU PROBABLY KNOW RATE CHANGE.\nI THINK THAT THERE'S A SENTIMENT THAT NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES AND\nRATE CHANGES AREN'T GOING TO DO IT.\nBUT THERE MAY BE MORE BOND PURCHASES IN THE FUTURE OR ETF\nFUTURES PERHAPS IN THE FUTURE BY THE BANK OF JAPAN.\nTHAT MAY INFLUENCE MARKETS. BUT I THINK YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT,\nA LOT OF THE VOLATILITY IN THE MARKETPLACE THROUGHOUT THE REST\nOF THE YEAR. AGAIN, IN RESPECT TO AND IN\nADDITION TO THE ELECTION. >> I WAS JUST GOING TO ASK ABOUT\nTHAT WITH 50 DAYS TO GO, JOHN, HOW YOU THINK THE RECENT SURGE\nIN MOMENTUM OF DONALD TRUMP AS A FRONT-RUNNER IN THE PRESIDENTIAL\nELECTION WILL IMPACT THE MARKET AND THE ECONOMY INTO THE\nELECTION. >> WELL, I WOULD SAY ANTICIPATE\nCHANGE. FOR HILLARY, THERE'S PROBABLY A\nLITTLE BIT OF A CONTINUATION, TO SOME EXTENT, PRESIDENT OBAMA'S\nPOLICIES. BUT WHENEVER WE HAVE A CHANGE IN\nPOLICY, I THINK ANALYSTS, ECONOMISTS LIKE MYSELF, FIXED\nANALYSTS, THEY STEP BACK TO SAY, WHAT ARE THE REASONABLE POLICY\nCHANGE THAT IS CAN BE PUT IN PLACE THAT WILL CHANGE OUR\nEXPECTED FUTURE PATH FOR EITHER INTEREST RATES AND/OR CORPORATE\nPROFITS. AND I THINK CHANGE IS THE BIG\nSTORY. WE NEED TO TAKE IT INTO OUR\nCALCULUS IN TERMS OF THE GATHERING MOMENTUM FOR DONALD\nTRUMP AT THIS POINT. >> JOHN, EITHER WAY, BOTH THE\nCANDIDATES ARE TALKING ABOUT SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE\nSPENDING AND FISCAL POLICY STIMULUS.\nIS THAT SOMETHING THAT MEANS ONCE WE GET OVER THIS\nUNCERTAINTY IN TERMS OF WHO THE CANDIDATE WILL BE, THE PRESIDENT\nWILL BE, THAT IF EITHER OF THEM DELIVERS A FISCAL POLICY\nSTIMULUS THAT THE ECONOMY SHOULD PICK UP SIGNIFICANTLY NEXT YEAR?\n>> YEAH, I THINK THERE ARE TWO LINES OF THINKING HERE.\nONE, OVER THE LAST THREE TO FIVE YEARS, IT'S BECOME MORE AND MORE\nAPPARENT TO PEOPLE THAT WE NEED SOME FISCAL STIMULUS.\nTHE MONETARY POLICY CAN ONLY GO SO FAR.\nAND I THINK A SECOND ASPECT IS, YES, SOME INFRASTRUCTURE\nSPENDING WELL THOUGHT OUT, NOT JUST SPEND MONEY, BUT LOOK AT\nTHE BENEFIT COST ANALYSIS, WILL ADD TO ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE\nNEXT YEAR OR TWO. CERTAINLY IN SOME MORE\nINDUSTRIAL AREAS, AREAS THAT HAVEN'T REALLY PARTICIPATE IN\nTHE OVERALL GROWTH OF THE ECONOMY.\n>> YEAH, I MEAN, IT DEPENDS ON WHAT HAPPENS WITH CONGRESS AND\nWHETHER THEY WILL EVEN PASS THAT AND WHO GETS THAT.\nBUT JOHN, QUICKLY, THIS WEEK WE HAVE A LOT OF HOUSING DATA.\nQUICKLY, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT? >> CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT.\nCONTINUED SENSE THAT BETTER JOB GROWTH, LOW INTEREST RATES\nREALLY HELP THE HOUSING MARKET OVERALL FOR THE ECONOMY.\n>> ALL RIGHT. WE'LL SEE WHAT THE NUMBERS SHOW\nSTARTING WITH THE SURVEY OF HOME BUILDERS TODAY.\nJOHN SILVIA, THANK YOU. >> QUICKLY, WHAT ARE YOU\nWATCHING? >> TECH BECAUSE THAT WAS THE\nOUTPERFORMER LAST WEEK. WE SAW THE TECH MARKET JUMP\nOVERNIGHT WITH APPLE STILL RIDING THE WAVE.\n>> I'M WATCHING THE BANKS. WELLS FARGO WAS THE WORST\nPERFORMER LAST WEEK.

THEY BOTH SEEMED CONCERNED ABOUT\nRAISING INTEREST RATES, AND HISTORICALLY YOU HAVE SUGGESTED\nYOU THINK THESE LOW INTEREST RATES MAY BE CREATING SOME\nADVERSE BUBBLES IN THE MARKETS. I WANT TO SEE WHERE YOU STAND\nTHESE DAYS? >> ANDREW, IT'S A COMPLICATED\nSITUATION. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE GOT GROWTH\nSTILL BUMPING ALONG IN THE U.S. AT, YOU KNOW, LESS THAN 2%.\nTHERE'S NO VISIBLE SIGNS OF INFLATION.\nWE HAVE GROWTH SLOWING AROUND THE WORLD.\nYOU HAVE GOT NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES IN EUROPE AND JAPAN AND\nELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD.

BUT THE SECOND ISSUE, WHICH IS\nOF EQUAL CONCERN TO ME, IS THAT WITH GROWTH SLOWING ALMOST\nEVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD, AND WITH INTEREST RATES\nEXTRAORDINARILY LOW, AND WITH DEBT INCREASING AT THE FEDERAL\nLEVEL AT A MUCH HIGHER LEVEL IN GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD,\nWHAT TOOLS ARE POLICYMAKERS GOING TO HAVE TO AVOID AND\nPREVENT A SLIDE INTO A RECESSION OR, GOD FORBID, PULL US OUT OF\nONE OR HELP US RESPOND TO A CRISIS?\nWE ARE IN UNCHARTERED ECONOMIC TERRITORY.\n>> THE QUESTION IS WHEN?

I DO RECOGNIZE THAT IF YOU ARE\nTHE CHAIRMAN OF THE FED AND YOU ARE LOOKING AT A SITUATION WHERE\nTHERE IS NO SIGN OF INFLATION, AND NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES IN\nJAPAN, IN EUROPE AND SWITZERLAND AND SWEDEN IN DENMARK, AND\nGROWTH DECLINING AROUND THE WORLD, IT SEEMS LIKE AND I GUESS\nIT'S A BIG DECISION, BUT AGAIN IT'S NOT THE BIG ISSUE.\nTHE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES ISSUE IS WHAT I HAVE JUST GONE\nTHROUGH. >> REALISTICALLY WHAT KIND OF\nGROWTH RATE DO YOU THINK YOU CAN SEE IN THIS COUNTRY, AND I ASK\nIN THE CONTEXT DONALD TRUMP SUGGESTED 4% IS NOT UNREALISTIC,\nWE COULD GET BACK THERE IF THE RIGHT STEPS WERE TAKEN IN\nWASHINGTON. >> LET ME SAY THIS, AND ONE\nTHING I DO BELIEVE IS WE ARE NOT GROWING AT ANYTHING NEAR OUR\nCAPACITY, SO WHETHER IT'S 3%, 3.5 OR 4%.\nWE ARE NOT GOING TO GET WHERE WE NEED TO GET UNLESS YOU SEE BIG,\nDIFFICULT STRUCTURAL REFORMS IN THE U.S.\n>> WHICH WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE THROUGH CONGRESS TO DO.\nNOW IT'S NOT JUST CONGRESS, IT'S THE GOVERNMENT RIGHT NOW.\nI MEAN, CONGRESS COULD WRITE A BEAUTIFUL TAX REFORM BILL THAT\nIS NEVER GOING TO GET SIGNED.

THE PROBLEM WITH TRADE IS SIMPLY\nTHIS. THE BENEFITS ARE SPREAD OVER THE\nENTIRE ECONOMY AND THERE ARE VERY REAL JOB LOSSES THAT COME\nFROM TRADE THAT HIT SPECIFIC SECTORS, BUT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM\nIS THAT MOST OF THE JOB LOSSES WE ARE SEEING TODAY IN MY\nJUDGMENT AREN'T COMING FROM TRADE BUT ARE COMING FROM\nODDMATION, ADVANCED IN TECHNOLOGY, WHICH BENEFIT THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE GREATLY AND IT BENEFITS SOCIETY, BUT ARE\nDEFINITELY DISRUPTING THE LABOR MARKETS AND DESTROYING MORE JOBS\nTHAN CREATING AND HOLLOWING OUT THE MIDDLE CLASS.\n>> THAT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE TAKING ONE ANIME AND\nSUBSTITUTING IT FOR ANOTHER? >> NO, I AM TAKING A FACT, OKAY?\nI AM TAKING A FACT THAT YOU LOOK AT ALMOST EVERY INDUSTRY TODAY,\nAND WHAT YOU SEE ARE -- WHETHER IT'S ARCHITECTURE, ENGINEERING,\nLAW, BUSINESS, ANYTHING THAT CAN BE AUTOMATED IS, AND IT IS\nCREATING DISRUPTIONS IN THE MARKETPLACE.\n>> WE HAVE SEEN IT FOR DECADES BUT IT'S HAPPENING FASTER?\n>> IT'S HAPPENING AT A MUCH FASTER CLIP, BUT I THINK WE HAVE\nTO DO A BETTER JOB OF EXPLAINING TRADE.\nIT'S NEVER BEEN EASY, AND IT'S NEVER BEEN POPULAR.\nI WAS VERY PLEASED TO SEE THAT THE WHITE HOUSE CALLED A MEETING\nON FRIDAY TO REALLY FOCUS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TRANCE PACIFIC\nPARTNERSHIP, TPP, BECAUSE THIS IS, AGAIN, HUGELY IMPORTANT,\nBECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I JUST MADE ARGUMENTS ABOUT TRADE, WHICH I\nREALLY BELIEVE IN, BUT THE TPP GOES BEYOND THAT BECAUSE OUR\nMARKETS ARE VERY OPEN, AND THEY ARE THE MOST OPEN IN THE WORLD.\nWE HAVE THE LOWEST TARIFFS, AND THE FEWEST TARIFFS.\nWHAT THE TPP DOES, EVEN IF PEOPLE ARE NOT ENTHUSIASTIC\nABOUT TRADE IN THE U.S. HOW COULD THEY OPPOSE TPP BECAUSE\nIT'S OPENING UP MARKETS AND FOR THE DIGITAL MARKET WHICH WILL\nBENEFIT YOU, AND GEOPOLITICALLY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT, BECAUSE\nTHE UNITED STATES -- IT'S ABOUT U.S. LEADERSHIP.\nTHE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA HAS SAID WE ARE GOING TO DO THIS\nAGREEMENT, AND WE HAVE OUR ALLIES, YOU KNOW, TRUSTING US,\nAND WE HAVE COUNTRIES LIKE VIETNAM AND MALAYSIA WILLING TO\nBREAK WITH THEIR PAST AND BECOME PART OF OUR SYSTEM, AND VIETNAM\nLOOKING AT CHANGING THEIR CONSTITUTION.\nIF WE CAN'T DELIVER ON THIS, HOW ARE WE AN ECONOMIC LEADER?\n>> THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T HAVE THE VOTES, IN HIS OWN PARTY HE\nDOESN'T HAVE THE VOTES. >> WE WILL HAVE TO GET THE VOTES\nBECAUSE IT'S JUST TOO IMPORTANT NOT TO, YOU KNOW.\n>> THE CHANCES ARE, WHAT AT THIS POINT?\n10%? >> I DON'T WANT TO, YOU KNOW --\nTRADE VOTES, JOE, ARE NEVER EASY.\nTHEY ARE NEVER EASY FOR REPUBLICANS AND THEY ARE NEVER\nEASY FOR DEMOCRATS, BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE STRONG, STRONG\nLEADERSHIP FROM THE WHITE HOUSE AND TAKE LEANING ON DEMOCRATS\nAND PRESIDENT CALLING IN SHIFTS AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO TAKE,\nI THINK, BUSINESS DOING A MUCH BETTER JOB OF GOING INTO\nINDIVIDUAL DISTRICTS SO THERE'S A COST THAT THE CONGRESSIONAL --\nTHE CONGRESSMEN HAVE FOR VOTING AGAINST TPP.\n>> YOU WROTE A VERY AGGRESSIVE, IF I COULD CALL IT THAT, OP ED\nIN THE WASHINGTON POST THIS YEAR ABOUT DONALD TRUMP.\nYOU ARE A REPUBLICAN AND WERE APPOINTED BY GEORGE W. BUSH AND\nHERE YOU WERE CALLING HIM A PHONEY AND IN THE RECESS SAYING\nYOU WERE VOTING FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nI WANT TO UNDERSTAND YOUR THINKING PROCESS AND WHAT THE\nREACTION HAS BEEN AMONG PEOPLE IN YOUR WORLD?\n>> FIRST OF ALL, THE REACTION -- LET ME JUST TELL YOU.\nPEOPLE IN GENERAL, WHAT YOU DO IS THE PEOPLE UNHAPPY YOU DON'T\nHEAR FROM, AND THE PEOPLE THAT LIKE IT SAY YOU ARE THE MAN,\nOKAY? IT'S THE SAME WITH THE T.A.R.P.\nI KNOW MOST OF THE PEOPLE ARE AGAINST THE ACTIONS WE HAVE\nTAKEN, AND I NEVER HAD A SINGLE PERSON COME UP TO ME AND SAY YOU\nARE A JERK FOR DOING THIS, AND THEY COME UP AND SAY THANK YOU\nFOR SAVING OUR COUNTRY AND THAT'S THE NATURE OF PEOPLE THAT\nARE POLITE.

I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT\nWE KEEP OUR LEADERSHIP POSITION THERE.\nTHE REASON I SAID I WAS GOING TO VOTE FOR HILLARY IS AS I LOOK AT\nTHE WORLD TODAY, I HAVE SAID REPEATEDLY, WE NEED BIG\nDIFFICULT STRUCTURAL REFORMS TO GET OUR U.S. ECONOMY GOING, AND\nI BELIEVE THAT THE BEST OPPORTUNITY TO GET THOSE IS WHEN\nYOU HAVE DIVIDED GOVERNMENT AND YOU NEED SOMEONE AS A LEADER WHO\nHAS A TEMPERAMENT THAT ALLOWS HIM OR HER TO COMPROMISE, TO BE\nABLE TO SAY, YOU KNOW, I UNDERSTAND THE OTHER SIDE, AND\nI'M NOT GOING TO DEMONIZE THEM AND FIND MIDDLE GROUND AND GET\nSOMETHING DONE AND THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN DO THAT, AND\nTHE PRESIDENT HAS TO LEAN ACROSS AND LEAN AGAINST THEIR PARTY.\n>> BUT SHE WOULD NEED TO DO THINGS DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED TO\nWHAT SHE BELIEVES. \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\"S WHICH\nHAS NOT BEEN POSITIVE ABOUT TRUMP AT ALL, AND CALLED HIS\nPOLICIES IN STARK CONTRAST OF WHAT HILLARY WANTED TO DO WITH\nTHE COUNTRY, TOTALLY DIFFERENT. 90% OF PAUL RYAN'S INITIATIVES\nHAVE BEEN HIJACKED BY DONALD TRUMP IN HIS SPEECH, AND YOU\nHAVE TEMPERAMENT CONDITIONS, AND 60% OF THE COUNTRY THINKS SHE IS\nUNTRUSTWORTHY, AND LOOKING AT POLICIES, REPUBLICAN POLICIES\nARE BEING PUT FORTH MUCH MORE READILY BY TRUMP THAN -- IT\nOCCURRED TO ME THAT IT'S DISINGENUOUS FOR YOU TO -- SHE\nWOULD HAVE TO TOTALLY CHANGE HER ECONOMIC POLICIES TO GET IN LINE\nWITH YOUR POLICIES? >> I DID NOT COME HERE TO DEBATE\nPOLITICS WITH YOU, BUT I WOULD SIMPLY SAY THAT I READ ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP'S SPEECH, YOU KNOW. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET ME TO\nSIGN ON TO ANY ECONOMIC POLICY THAT DOESN'T DEAL WITH OUR\nBALLOONING DEBT AND ENTITLEMENTS AND TAKES THE, YOU KNOW,\nEXORBITANT VIEWS BEING TAKEN THERE ON TRADE, BUT TO ME, TO\nME, IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO TWO THINGS.\nAS I SAID, IT COMES DOWN TO CHARACTER AND TEMPERAMENT AND AN\nABILITY TO WORK ACROSS THE AISLE, AND I WATCHED SECRETARY\nCLINTON WHEN SHE WAS A SENATOR DO THAT, OKAY?\nALSO, I WOULD TAKE -- YOU LEARN A LOT WHEN YOU ARE SECRETARY OF\nSTATE, AND I WOULD -- TO ME, I WOULD TAKE THAT EXPERIENCE ANY\nDAY. I SAID WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY\nABOUT DONALD TRUMP IN MY -- IN MY OP ED IN THE \"WASHINGTON\nPOST.\" I CAN'T SIGN ON TO THE SORT OF\nPOP POP YAO LIZAM, AND I AM WHERE I AM AND I AM A REPUBLICAN\nAND I AM HOPING WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A MAJORITY IN THE SENATE,\nAND I AM HOPING WE WILL HAVE A BIG MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE, AND I\nAM HOPING -- >> TO STOP HILLARY DOING\nANYTHING OF THE RAISING TAXES AND MAYBE THE REPUBLICANS WILL\nSTOP HER FROM DOING ALL THE THINGS WE KNOW SHE WILL DO THAT\nARE WRONG? >> MAYBE WE WILL COMPROMISE TO\nGET SOME OF THE BIG DIFFICULT THINGS DONE.\n>> OKAY. >> AND LASTLY, I HAVE GOT A\n94-YEAR-OLD MOTHER AND I HAVE THREE GRAND DAUGHTERS, AND I\nHAVE A WIFE THAT WOULD LIKE TO SEE A WOMAN PRESIDENT, AND YOU\nKNOW WHAT? I THINK I WILL THROW IN WITH\nTHEM. >> FAIR ENOUGH.\nBEFORE YOU GO YOU HAVE A NEW IMPORTANT PAPER OUT ON CHINA AND\nI WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT IT BEFORE WE GO.\nYOU TALK ABOUT THE IDEA THERE'S GOING TO BE MUCH MORE DIRECT\nINVESTMENT FROM CHINA INTO THE UNITED STATES IN THE COMING\nYEARS. HOW SHOULD WE AS A COUNTRY THINK\nABOUT THAT RELATIVE TO ALL OF THE ISSUES WE JUST TALKED ABOUT?\n>> WELL, THE FOREIGN INVESTMENT LIKE TRADE IS VERY UNPOPULAR AT\nTHE MACRO LEVEL. VERY POPULAR FOREIGNERS BUYING\nU.S. ASSETS. YOU ARE SHOWING LONG-TERM\nCONFIDENCE AND FOREIGN INVESTMENT HAS GOT THE\nPOTENTIAL, INCLUDING INVESTMENT FROM CHINA TO INCREASE JOBS AND\nMAINTAIN JOBS, AND SO TO ME, IN TODAY'S WORLD, YOU ARE GOING TO\nSEE INCREASINGLY FIERCE COMPETITION FOR INVESTMENT, AND\nIT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE WELCOME INVESTMENT THAT IS GOING\nTO HELP OUR ECONOMY. AND I LOOK AT -- I WROTE THAT\nPAPER BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE FUNDAMENTALS MEAN THERE WILL BE\nMUCH MORE OUTGOING INVESTMENT FROM CHINA, AND IT'S GOING TO BE\nMUCH MORE DRIVEN BY PRIVATE SECTOR COMPANIES COMPARED TO AS\nOPPOSED TO STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES, AND IT'S GOING TO\nBE FOCUSED ON -- IT GOING TO BE DRIVEN BY A NUMBER OF THINGS,\nCOMPANIES THAT HAVE BIG BUSINESS IN CHINA ARE LOOKING TO BECOME\nGLOBAL COMPANIES, AND LOOKING TO GET TO CONSUMERS, SERVICES, AND\nADVANCED MANUFACTURING, AND SO THEY ARE -- YOU ARE GOING TO SEE\nTHIS COMING TO THE UNITED STATES AND THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF MY\nPAPER WAS TO MAKE THE CASE THAT A LOT OF THIS IS INVESTMENT THAT\nWE SHOULD WELCOME. >> WE COULD COMPARE THAT TO THE\nJAPANESE WHEN THEY WERE BUYING PEBBLE BEACH THAT WAS UNPOPULAR.\n>> YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. WE HATE THE FACT, AND I REMEMBER\nWHEN THE JAPANESE INVESTMENT WAS COMING IN AND THEY WOULD BE VERY\nCONCERNED, PEBBLE BEACH AND ROCKEFELLER CENTER, AND I WOULD\nSAY THEY ARE GOING TO STAY IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\nAND WE ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE THEM TO JAPAN.\nWE HAVE GOT THEM AND THE CAPITAL.\nI THINK WHAT MAKES THIS MORE COMPLICATED IS BECAUSE PEOPLE\nARE RAISING ISSUES ABOUT CHINA, AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME\nACCESS, AND THERE ARE SUBSIDIES TO STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES AND\nDON'T PLAY ON A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD, AND IT'S A DANGEROUS\nTHING IF YOU START GOING DOWN A TIT FOR TAT APPROACH BECAUSE THE\nFACT IS REGARDLESS OF WHAT CHINA DOES, WE -- WHY SHOULD WE TURN\nOUR BACK ON INVESTMENT THAT HELPS THE UNITED STATES, NUMBER\nONE? NUMBER TWO, THIS INVESTMENT\nPROVIDES LINKS, AND THESE ECONOMIC LINKAGES ARE VERY\nIMPORTANT. THIRDLY, I AM IN SUPPORT OF THE\nBILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATY, BECAUSE WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO --\nTHE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS STILL VERY SERIOUS ABOUT NEGOTIATING\nTHIS WITH THE CHINESE AND MAKING PROGRESS, BECAUSE REFORMERS IN\nCHINA USE THE BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATY AS A LEVER TO\nOPEN UP THEIR PERFORMANCE AND LEVERAGE TO COMPETITION.\n>> HANK PAULSON, THANK YOU FOR TOUCHING ON SO MANY DIFFERENT\nSUBJECTS THIS MORNING. GOOD TO SEE YOU.\n>> THANK YOU.",

CLOUD,\nMINNESOTA. WE HEARD FROM THE FBI, THEY'RE\nINVESTIGATING THE INCIDENT AS A POTENTIAL ACT OF TERRORISM.\nISIS NOW CLAIMING THE ATTACK WAS CARRIED OUT BY A QUOTE, SOLGS OF\nT ISLAMIC STATE.\nPOLICE SAY THEY HAVE FOUND SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE BOMB\nTHAT WENT OFF IN NEW YORK CITY AND THE ONE IN SEASIDE PARK, NEW\nJERSEY. HOWEVER, THEY HAVE NOT CONCLUDED\nTHAT THE INCIDENTS ARE CONNECTED ACCORDING TO SOURCES TALKING TO\nOUR JOURNALISTS HERE. OUR EXPERT RS FOLLOWING THESE\nSTORIES. I WANT TO START WITH DEB\nFAYERICK AS SHE IS AT THE SUSTAIN OF THE YORK BOMBING.\nWHAT MORE ARE YOU LEARN SOMETHING.\n>> THE TWO BIG QUESTIONS ARE WHO AND WHY.\nTHERE ARE TWO SEPARATE CRIME SCENE, ONE HERE BEHIND ME.\nABOUT A BLOCK AND A HALF. YOU'VE GOT TEAMS OF FORENSIC\nINVESTIGATORS. I WALKED BY THEM EARLIER AND\nTHEY ARE COLLECTING EVIDENCE OF THE GROUND.\nTHEY HAVE NUMBERED PIECE OF SHARP NELL.\nTHAT'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE ANALYZED AT QUANTICO, WHERE IT'S\nBEING TAKEN TO DETERMINE IF IT WAS FROM THE RESULTING\nEXPLOSION. IT COULD BE SOMETHING RANDOM.\nTHINK ABOUT THE BOSTON MARATHON BOMBING WHEN WIRES WERE FOUND\nWITH PIECES OF THE PRESSURE COOKER.\nAS FAR AS THE 27th STREET INCIDENT, THE REASON THAT DEVICE\nWAS UNCOVERED IS BECAUSE AFTER THE EXPLOSION TOOK PLACE HERE,\nPOLICE DID A SWEEP OF THE ENTIRE AREA.\nAND TWO OFFICERS ON FOOT WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THAT GAS PRICE\nDWOOIS AND IT'S MORE CRITICAL ON SOME LEVELS BECAUSE IT DID NOT\nGO OFF. WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT WAS\nOPERATIONAL. IT COULD MEAN THERE'S DNA\nEVIDENCE, A FINGERPRINT, PIECE OF HAIR, SOMETHING ON THE TAPE\nOR WIRES USED TO CREATE THAT. SO THAT'S CRITICAL AND THE BOMB\nSQUAD HAS BEEN WORKING ON THAT DEVICE ALL AFTERNOON TO\nDETERMINE SPECIFICALLY WHAT IT WAS.\nAND SO, WE'RE WAITING FOR INFORMATION ON THAT.\nWE CAN TELL YOU POLICE KNOW THAT THIS WAS INTENTIONAL.\nTHEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE MOTIVATION IS.\nNOR DO THEY KNOW WHY IT HAPPENED HERE IN CHELSEA.\nAND POLICE ARE NOW LOOKING AT VIDEO SURVEILLANCE TAKEN FROM A\nLOT OF STORES, A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE BEEN WALKING BY AND\nSCENE SOMETHING. THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO\nDETERMINE. THEY DON'T KNOW WHY THE DEVICE\nWAS PLACED IN THE DUMPSTER AND SO THAT'S ALSO CRITICAL BECAUSE\nA SQUAD CAR MARKED SQUAD CAR WAS JUST A BLOCK AWAY WHEN THE\nDEVICE DETONATED, SO THEY DON'T KNOW WHO'S OUT THERE AND WHO MAY\nHAVE CONE THIS. THAT'S WHY THE FBI AND NYPD ARE\nPLAYING THIS VERY CLOSE BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO GIVE AWAY ANY\nCLUES ACCIDENTALLY THAT COULD PERHAPS LEAD THE PERSONS\nRESPONSIBLE TO REALIZE THAT THEY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN TERMS OF\nWHO THEY MIGHT BE LOOKING FOR. SECURITY HERE, ESPECIALLY TIGHT.\nTHE NEW COMMISSIONER SAYING THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY WAS EXPECTED\nSTARTING TOMORROW AND SO, SECURITY WAS GOING TO BE TIGHT\nANY WAY. BUT NOW, IT'S TO BE A LOT MORE\nIN TERMS OF THE LEVEL OF ALERTNESS BECAUSE THIS HAS\nHAPPENED. SO VERY ACTIVE KRAM SEEN.\nTHOSE INVESTIGATORS PICK I GUESS UP EVERY PIECE OF -- AND PERHAPS\nEVEN WHO THEY ARE. >> PICKING UP THE PIECES AS YOU\nSAY, LOOKING FOR ANY MORE FORENSIC EVIDENCE.\nOUR VEST INVESTIGATORS SAYING ANYTHING MORE ABOUT WHY THEY\nSUSPECT THIS AREA WAS TARGETED. >> WELL, AND THAT'S EXACTLY\nRIGHT. THAT IS THE BIG QUESTION.\nYOU KNOW, WE ARE JUST ABOUT A BLOCK AND A HALF AWAY FROM WHERE\nTHE DEVICE DETONATED AND EVEN THOUGH TCHELSEA ON A SATURDAY\nNIGHT IS VERY, VERY BUSY, THE AREA WHERE THE DUMPSTER WAS\nLOCATED AND DEVICE EXPLODED, IT'S A LOT LESS BUSY THAN THE\nAREA I'M AT RIGHT NOW. AND INTERESTINGLY, WHETHER THE\nPERSON WAS CARRYING OR PLACED IT THERE AND GOT SPOOKED, THAT'S\nUNDER VINVESTIGATION. THAT DUMPSTER MAY HAVE BLUNTED\nTHE IMPACT OF THE BOMB AND THEREFORE, CAUSED FEWER\nINJURIES. NOW, NOT MINIMIZING THE NUMBER,\nTHERE ARE ABOUT 29 PEOPLE WHO WENT TO BELLEVUE HOSPITAL, BUT\nBECAUSE IT EXPLODED IN A DUMPSTER AND NOT ON THE STREET,\nAGAIN, IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF EXPLOSION THAN IT MAY\nHAVE BEEN OTHERWISE. >> ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU SO MUCH.\nKEEP US POSTED. WE'RE ALSO NOW SEEING NEW\nPICTURES OF THE MOMENT OF THE AFTERMATH OF LAST NIGHT'S\nEXPLOSION. WHAT ARE WE SEEING?\n>> IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE AS LIFE KIND OF SLOWLY TURNS BACK\nTO NORMAL IN THAT VICINITY, BUSINESS OWNER RS GETTING BACK\nINTO THEIR STORES AND TURNING OVER THE SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE,\nWHICH WILL BE CRUCIAL TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INVESTIGATORS IN\nPUTTING THE PIECES OF THE PUZZLE TOGETHER AND WE JUST GOT FOOTAGE\nFROM A BUSINESS OWNER, A BARBERSHOP ON 23rd STREET AND IF\nYOU LOOK IT, YOU'LL SEE A WOMAN WHO IS CLEANING THERE.\nNOW, YOU'RE SEEING PEOPLE RUNNING LIKE SHE WAS CLEANINGING\nAND SHE'S GETTING UP, CLEARLY NOTICING THE EXPLOSION.\nAND THE PEOPLE SORT OF RUNNING AWAY FROM IT.\nIT GETS TO THIS IDEA OF THE CONFUSION ON THE GROUND, MOST\nPEOPLE YOU KNOW IN THE VICINITY WERE AT RISK OF BEING HIT BY THE\nDEBRIS AS A RESULT OF THE EXPLOSION.\nTHEY SUFFERED INJURY, YOU KNOW, BEING HIT WITH GLASS AND METAL\nTHAT FLEW OFF OF DOORS AND WINDOWS.\nTHOSE ARE WITH KINDS OF INJURIES WE WERE SEEING AND HEAR ING ABOT\nAT BELLEVUE EARLIER TODAY. ALSO, MY COLLEAGUE SPOKE TO A\nMAN WHO WAS DRIVING AND LOST CONTROL OF THE CAR AS A RESULT\nOF THE EDUCATION PLOEGS TAKE A LISTEN.\n>> I CAN TELL YOU VAGUELY WHAT I REMEMBER.\nDRIVING A CAR. AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW, I FELT\nAN EXPLOSION AND THE CAR JUST TILTED OVER.\nHALFWAY. CAME BACK DOWN.\nWHAT HAPPENED WAS I JUST BLACKED OUT.\nNEXT THING YOU KNOW, I'M IN AN AMBULANCE!\nWHAT ABOUT YOU? >> EVERYTHING WAS SO SUDDEN AND\nFAST. IT WAS MORE OF A SHOCK.\nTHAN I REMEMBER. >> HOW ARE YOU DOING NOW?\n>> PAIN. YOU KNOW, LITTLE TRAUMATIZED.\nI WAS CLOSE TO NOT ACTUALLY SEEING MY SON AGAIN.\nTHAT WAS THE SCARIEST PART OF THE NIGHT FOR ME.\n>> FRED RICKA, LUCKILY, MANY PEOPLE WALKED OUT OF THE\nHOSPITAL. IN FACT, SEVERAL HOURS AFTER\nTHAT INTERVIEW, GOVERNOR CUOMO SAID THAT ALL OF THE 24 PEOPLE\nTHAT WERE TREATED IN THE WERE SKENTLY RELEASEDED, WHICH IS\nQUITE REMARKABLE IF YOU THINK ABOUT HOW CROWDED, HOW POPULATED\nTHAT SPECIFIC SPECIFIC AREA IS AND THE FORCE THAT EXPLOSION\nTHAT THE DESTRUCTION THAT IT CAUSED BECAUSE OF THE FORCE.\nYOU PUT THESE TWO THINGS TOGETHER, YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT\nTHERE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE PEOPLE.\nLUCKILY, NEW YORKERS ARE VERY RELIEVED TONIGHT THAT THE DAMAGE\nIN TERMS OF PEOPLE AT LEAST IS MINIMAL.\n>> RIGHT. AND JUST LOOKING AT THE VIDEO\nHERE, CLEARLY, A VARIETY OF VICTIM FRS THE ELDERLY TO THE\nVERY YOUNG. VERY CLOSE CALL FOR SO MANY.\n29 INJURED AGAIN. ALL RELEASED FROM HOSPITALS.\nNONE LIFE THREATENING. THAT IS GOOD NEWS.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH. SO, THE FBI IS NOW CALLING THE\nSTABBING ATTACK AT A SHOPPING MALL IN ST. CLOUD, MINNESOTA, A\nPOTENTIAL ACT OF TERRORISM. NINE PEOPLE WERE STABBED.\nTHREE OF THEM REMAIN HOSPITALIZED.\nTHE SUSPECT WAS SHOT DEAD BY AN OFF DUTY POLICE OFFICER.\nISIS NOW CLAIMING THE ATTACK WAS CARRIED OUT BY A QUOTE, SOLDIER\nOF THE ISLAMIC STATE, END QUOTE. WITNESSES SAID HE WAS WEARING A\nPRIVATE SECURITY COMPANY UNIFORM.\nAND MADE REFERENCES TO ALLA DURING THE ATTACK.\nNICK VALENCIA IS FOLLOWING THIS FOR US.\nWHAT MORE ARE INVESTIGATORS WILLING TO SAY?\n>> THEY'RE HIGHLIGHTING THIS VALIANT EFFORT AND HEROICS OF\nTHE OFF DUTY POLICE OFFICER WHO ENGAGED THE SUSPECT, FIRING AT\nHIM MULTIPLE TIMES. THE SUSPECT GETTING UP ON THREE\nVARIOUS TIMES BEFORE HE WAS FINALLY NEUTRALIZED.\nTHE FBI UNWILLING TO CONFIRM THAT THIS IS AN ACT OF TERRORISM\nONLY INVESTIGATING IT SO FAR A AS A POTENTIAL ACT OF TERRORISM.\nWE HEARD ALSO FROM THE POLICE CHIEF THERE IN ST. CLOUD.\nMENTIONING THE IRONY THAT THIS ALSO TOOK PLACE ON THE SAME\nNIGHT WE SAW EXPLOSIONS IN NEW JERSEY AS WELL AS NEW YORK.\nTHERE IS NO APPARENT LINK SO FAR.\nBUT THEY ARE LOOK ING AT THE SIMILARITIES, THEY ARE LOOKING\nAT THE FACT THIS TOOK PLACE ON THE VERY SAME DAY.\nNOT MUCH KNOWN ABOUT THE SUSPECT.\nHE HAS NOT BEEN OFFICIALLY IDED, BUT HE HAS HAD THREE ENCOUNTERS\nIN PAST FOR POLICE OFFICER, ALL MINOR TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS.\nWE KNOW THAT WHILE HE WAS CARRYING OUT THESE STABBINGS, HE\nWAS ASKING ONE INDIVIDUAL IF HE WAS A MUSLIM BEFORE HE WAS\nSTABBEDED. ALSO MENTIONING ALLA.\nOF COURSE, THE MEDIA WING FOR ISIS ONLINE TAKING CREDIT FOR\nTHIS. SAYING HE WAS A SOLDIER OF ISIS.\nCNN HAS NO WAYS, IS UNABLE TO AUTHENTICATE THIS CLAIM, BUT I\nMENTIONED THE FBI IS INVESTIGATING THIS AS POSSIBLE\nPOTENTIAL ACT OF TERRORISM. EAR\nEARLIER, I SPOKE TO A WITNESS THERE AT THE MALL WHEN THIS\nATTACK HAPPENED. >> AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, CHAOS\nJUST BROKE OUT. THERE WAS A BUNCH OF PEOPLE\nRUNNING IN INTO THE J.C. PENNY MALL ENTRANCE AND THEY WERE JUST\nCREAM SKROOEM THAG SOMEONE WAS GOING AROUND THE MALL STABBING\nPEOPLE AND THAT THERE WAS BLOOD EVERYWHERE.\nAND IT WAS JUST HONESTLY A REALLY SCARY EXPERIENCE.\nI DROPPED EVERYTHING IN MY HANDS AND BOOKEDED IT BACK THE MY\nCO-WORKERS TO NOTIFY HER OF WHAT WAS GOING ON.\nI RAN OUT A DIFFERENT EXIT OUT OF OUR J.C. PENNY'S, WHICH LED\nSTRAIGHT TO THE PARKING LOT AND I JUST JUMPED IN MY CAR AND SPED\nOFF AS FAST AS I COULD. >> A WITNESS OF WHAT HAPPENED\nYESTERDAY IN ST. CLOUD, MINNESOTA, SHE SAID SHE'S HAD A\nLOT OF TROUBLE SLEEPING AFTER WITNESSES WHAT SHE SAW.\nNINE STABBED, THREE REMAIN HOSPITALIZED AND THEY RANGE IN\nAGE FROM 15 YEARS OLD TO 53 YEARS OLD.\nTHIS INVESTIGATE CONTINUES THERE AT THE MALL.\nIT REMAINS CLOSED. IT STILL IS AN ACTIVE CRIME\nSCENE. VEST DWATERS SAYING THEY\nDISCOVER IT HAD THE CAR OF THIS INDIVIDUAL IN THE PARKING LOT.\nTHEY'VE EXECUTED AT LEAST TWO SEARCH WARNS AT ONE RESIDENCE.\n>> THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE STABBINGS\nAND THE EXPLOSIONS IN NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY.\nWHAT ARE THE COMMON ALITICOMMON. THE SIMILARITIES AND\nDIFFERENCES. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.",

ONE IS TO HAVE IT PLANNED IN\nRAQQAH AS PART OF THE FOREIGN OPERATIONS.\nTHEY HAVE A WING WHICH IS RESPONSIBILITY FOR\nCONCEPTUALIZING ATTACKS. AND THE SECOND IS THE LONE WOLF\nOR STRAY DOG ATTACK.

CLOUD, MINNESOTA.\nWHAT IS THE LATEST, ROSA? >> CHRIS, GOOD MORNING.\nLET ME GET YOU UP TO SPEED HERE. ACCORDING TO POLICE ONE MAN\nUSING A PRIVATE SECURITY COMPANY UNIFORM WALK UNDER TO THE MALL\nTHAT YOU SEE BEHIND ME, MADE A REFERENCE TO ALLAH AND ASKED A\nCOUPLE OF PEOPLE IF THEY WERE MUSLIM BEFORE ATTACKING THEM\nWITH A KNIFE. NOW, AUTHORITIES ARE NOT\nIDENTIFYING THIS MAN AT THIS TIME, BUT SATURDAY NIGHT BY THE\nEND OF THE NIGHT HE HAD STABBED NINE PEOPLE.\nTHREE OF THEM ARE STILL IN THE HOSPITAL.\nONE WITH LIFE-THREATENING INJURIES.\nNOW, AUTHORITIES SAY THAT THIS COULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH WORSE.\nOFFICIAL OS WHO HAVE SEEN THE SURVEILLANCE VIDEO SAY THAT ONE\nMAN IS HAILED A HERO. OFF-DUTY POLICE OFFICER JASON\nFALCONER. THEY SAY HE SHOT AND KILLED THE\nSUSPECT IN THIS CASE AND EVEN SHOOTING HIM DOWN WHEN THIS\nSUSPECT WAS LUNGING AT HIM. NOW, LIKE YOU MENTIONED, A NEWS\nAGENCY LINKED TO ISIS HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY CALLING\nTHIS SUSPECT A SOLDIER OF THE ISLAMIC STATE.\nNOW, CNN CANNOT INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRM THOSE DETAILS, BUT, OF\nCOURSE, AS YOU MENTIONED, THE FBI IS INVESTIGATING THIS AS A\nPOSSIBLE ACT OF TERRORISM. >> ROSA, THANK YOU FOR ALL OF\nTHAT. LET'S DISCUSS ALL OF THE\nDEVELOPMENTS WITH JULIET, OUR CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST,\nPHIL MUDD AND FORMER COUNTERTERRORISM OFFICIAL AND\nMICHAEL WEISS CO-AUTHOR OF \"ISIS INSIDE THE ARMY OF TERROR.\"\nTHANKS FOR ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE.\nLET'S TALK ABOUT THESE THREE LOCATIONSS OF ALL THESE DIFFERET\nBOMBS. THE MOST RECENT ELIZABETH AT\nTHIS TRAIN STATION FOUND LAST NIGHT AND THE CHELSEA\nNEIGHBORHOOD IN MANHATTAN AND SEASIDE PARK IN NEW JERSEY ALONG\nTHE ROUTE OF WHAT WAS A CHARITY RUN.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK THE SIGNIFICANCE IS DO YOU THINK\nTHEY ARE COORDINATED? >> I THINK WE DON'T KNOW YET.\nI'LL TAKE THE FACTS AND TELL YOUR VIEWERS ABOUT THE\nCONNECTION. I THINK NO QUESTION IF WE JUST\nSTART FROM THE BEGINNING OR START FROM THE MIDDLE, WHICH IS\nTHE NEW YORK ATTACKS ON 23rd AND 27th.\nYOU HAVE THE SAME INDIVIDUAL AND VERY SIMILAR BOMBS.\nGOING BACK A DAY TO NEW JERSEY. STARTING THE WEEKEND, ALL WE\nHAVE HEARD IS THAT THERE ARE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN NEW JERSEY\nAND NEW YORK. BUT WE DON'T KNOW IF MATERIALS\nFOUND IN THE BOMBS ON SATURDAY ARE THE SAME IN NEW YORK ARE THE\nSAME AS THOSE IN NEW JERSEY. THOSE INCLUDE ALUMINUM POWER AND\nT T\nTANARITE AND THOSE ARE THINGS THAT ARE EASILY PURCHASED\nANYWHERE. WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THE\nEXPLOSIVES BUT COINCIDENCES LIKE THIS DON'T HAPPEN VERY OFTEN.\nIF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS IN THE TOTALITY, YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IT\nOVER THE COURSE OF THE WEEKEND. WHAT WE HAVE ON THE\nINVESTIGATION SIDE IS, OBVIOUSLY, THE SAME PERSON ON\nSATURDAY NIGHT, AS YOU GUYS REPORTED LAST NIGHT.\nAND VIDEO SURVEILLANCE AT VARIOUS PLACES THAT MAY HELP.\nRIGHT NOW INVESTIGATORS ARE DEPENDENT ON MATERIALS IN TERMS\nOF CONNECTING THE THINGS AND SURVEILLANCE.\nAND THAT'S ESSENTIALLY HOW THIS WILL UNFOLD.\nYOU KNOW, THERE'S THESE GUYS THAT ARE NOW JUST STOPPED IN THE\nCAR AND WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH TO SIMPLY MAKE SPECULATION OF WHAT\nTHAT IS. THAT'S WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW.\n>> MOVING VERY QUICKLY. DIFFERENT STATES, OBVIOUSLY, ALL\nWORKING IN COORDINATION WITH THE FEDS ON THIS.\nTHEY DO BELIEVE THERE'S SIMILARITIES AND DETONATION\nTECHNIQUES VERY CRUDE ONES FOUND ON THE INTERNET OR MAGAZINE\nWHERE YOU CAN FIND TO DO THIS KIND OF STUFF.\nYOU HAVE THREE PHASES. HOW THE PROSECUTORS ARE LOOKING\nAT IT, WHICH IS WHERE YOUR MIND GOES.\nHOW THE INVESTIGATORS LOOK AT THIS AND WE HAVE PHIL MUDD FOR\nTHAT AND THE LARGER MOTIVATIONS HERE AND WE HAVE MICHAEL FOR\nTHAT. PHIL, WHEN YOU'RE SIZING UP THIS\nINVESTIGATION, MULTIPLE EVENTS POPPING UP AND SIMILAR IN TERMS\nOF WHAT THESE PEOPLE DID TO PUT THE BOMBS AND HOW THEY LOOK.\nWHAT ARE THE PHASES? >> LOOK, THE FIRST PHASE IS\nOPENING UP THE FACTS. I THIRD PEOPLE, FOR EXAMPLE,\nTALK ABOUT THIS IS TERRORISM. THAT IS NOT A FACT, CHRIS.\nTHE FACT IS WE HAVE DEVICES AND THE FBI LABS SHOULD BE ABLE TO\nTELL VERY QUICKLY WHETHER, FOR EXAMPLE, THE WIRING IN THOSE\nDEVICES INDICATES THE SAME INDIVIDUAL WIRED BOTH OF THEM.\nWE HAVE VIDEO AND WE HAVE CALL INS.\nYOU MIGHT HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT A STOP OF SOME SUSPECTS OR PERSONS\nOF INTEREST. AND LICENSE PLATES FROM VEHICLES\nTHAT WERE GOING THROUGH THE AREA.\nSO, WE'RE SPECULATING ON WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED HERE BUT\nINSIDE THIS GAME INVESTIGATORS IF YOU LISTEN TO THE LAST MOMENT\nOF CONVERSATION, INVESTIGATORS HAVE A LARGE VOLUME OF DATA THAT\nTHEY'RE ALREADY STARTING TO SORT THROUGH.\nTHAT WILL TAKE THEM A COUPLE DAYS, CHRIS, BEFORE THE FACTS\nNARROW DOWN. >> HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT\nBECAUSE COMMON SENSE TELLS YOU, SOMEBODY'S DOING THIS TO DISRUPT\nOUR WAY OF LIFE. IT'S A HOMICIDAL ACT WITHOUT A\nSPECIFIC TARGET. IT'S TERRORISM.\nYOU'RE SAYING, NO. IS THAT THE MIND OF THE\nINVESTIGATOR BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO MAKE A CASE AS SUCH?\n>> NO, IT'S BECAUSE TERRORISM REQUIRES A POLITICAL MOTIVATION\nAND I DON'T KNOW THE MOTIVATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL.\nLET'S ASSUME, FOR EXAMPLE, A MALE WHO LOST HIS GIRLFRIEND AND\nWANT TO BLOW UP A BLOCK. IF YOU WANT TO TELL ME YOU KNOW\nWHAT THIS PERSON WAS TRYING TO DO, I WOULD TELL YOU, HOW WOULD\nYOU KNOW THAT? I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT THE\nMOTIVATION WAS AND WHETHER THIS WAS AN ACT OF TERROR BEFORE I\nUNDERSTAND WHAT WAS IN HIS MIND OR HER MIND.\n>> MICHAEL, NO CLAIM OF RESPONSIBILITY FROM ISIS.\nWHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO YOU? >> NOTHING.\n>> THIS COULD BE, AS PHIL WAS POINTING OUT, SOME GRIEVED\nLUNETIC WHO WANTED TO KILL AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT\nANY POLITICAL MOTIVATION. IF IT WAS JIHADIISIS HAS TWO\nMAIN TACTICS THEY CHOOSE FROM. ONE IS THE ISIS DIRECTED ATTACK\nSUCH AS PARIS AND BRUSSELS AND NICE AND THE OTHER IS THE\nISIS-INSPIRED ATTACK OR THE LONE  THE ISIS SPOKESMAN THAT THE\nCOALITION KILLED A COUPLE WEEKS IN 2014 CAME OUT WITH THIS,\nBASICALLY A GLOBAL INJUNCTION TO ALL MUSLIMS TO KILL THE INFIDEL\nWHEREVER YOU TAKE HIM. DRIVE OVER HIM, TAKE A KNIFE AND\nSTAB HIM. THESE ARE THE INDIVIDUAL\nSOLDIERS OF IT. NOW, ISIS MAY NOT KNOW IF THIS\nWAS ISIS-INSPIRED YET. THEY DID COME OUT OR CLAIM\nRESPONSIBILITY. THEY ARE NOT THE ONLY JIHADIST\nORGANIZATION. WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH YET ABOUT\nNEW YORK. MINNESOTA, I'M MORE INCLINED TO\nSAY IT'S -- >> LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.\nTHAT WAS A MALL ATTACK THAT SOMEBODY CLAIMED -- I THINK THAT\nIS ISIS-INSPIRED AND HE WAS ABLE TO STAND MULTIPLE PEOPLE BEFORE\nBEING KILLED. >> THAT IS MORE ISIS-DIRECTED.\nHE CAME OUT AND SAID HE'S A SOLDIER OF AN ISLAMIC STATE THAT\nSUGGESTS THEY PROBABLY KNEW AND WHAT WORRIES ME IS I INTERVIEW\nPEOPLE WITHIN ISIS AND A FEW MONTHS AGO A GUY I PROFILED IN\n\"THE DAILY BEAST\" A MEMBER OF THEIR SPY SERVICE, THE STATE\nSECURITY OR THE FBI OF ISIS HAS INFORMANTS PLACED WITHIN ISIS\nINCLUDING IN THE FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE BRANCH WHICH PLANS\nTHESE ATTACKS OVERSEAS. HE TOLD ME IN THE NEXT THREE\nMONTHS OR SO THEY'RE PLANNING SOMETHING IN MINNESOTA.\nSPECIFICALLY GOING BE FROM THE SOMALI, WE CAN'T CONFIRM THIS,\nBUT LOCAL REPORTING IN MINNESOTA SUGGESTS THIS GUY WAS A\n22-YEAR-OLD AND BORN IN KENYA BUT OF SOMALI BACKGROUND.\nI SHARE THIS INFORMATION WITH THE FBI AND THEY SAID, THANKS,\nWE'LL LOOK INTO IT AND NEVER REALLY HEARD BACK FROM THEM.\n>> YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS IN DIFFERENT PHASES.\nI GET THAT IT'S FRUSTRATING FOR PEOPLE.\nEVEN THIS TERRORISM QUESTION. IT'S A VERY STRAIGHT SHOT FOR\nPHILIP MUDD. JULIET, WE DEAL WITH THIS ALL\nTHE TIME AND WE GET IT. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO\nNONINVESTIGATIVE PEOPLE. WHO ELSE PLANTS BOMBS IN RANDOM\nAREAS WHERE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE OTHER THAN SOMEBODY WHO IS UP\nTO NO GOOD AND AFFECT OUR WAY OF LIFE.\nWHY ISN'T THAT ENOUGH? IS THE DISTINCTION BECAUSE\nYOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO INTO COURT AND MAKE A CASE AND IT\nCAN'T BE IT FEELS LIKE SOMETHING?\n>> IT'S ALL OF THE ABOVE. LOOK, NONE OF US ARE QUESTIONING\nTHE TERROR OCCURRED IN PARTICULAR.\nYOU KNOW, ON SATURDAY MORNING, SATURDAY NIGHT AND FEAR OF\nTERROR. THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN A\nPROSECUTOR NEEDING TO MAKE A TERRORISM CASE AND REITERATING\nWHAT WE SAID ALL WEEK. WE DON'T KNOW WHO THE CULPRITS\nARE. A NUMBER OF MOTIVATIONS.\nTHEY MAY SEEM OBVIOUS TO US THAT THIS IS A POLITICALLY MOTIVATED.\nWE TALK ABOUT STAITERROR AND IS AND YOU DON'T WANT INVESTIGATORS\nGOING INTO AN INVESTIGATION ASSUMING TOO MUCH BECAUSE YOU'RE\nGOING TO MISS CLUES. THAT'S WHY YOUR ANALYSTS ARE\nSAYING, LOOK AT THE FACTS. THE FACTS GIVE YOU A LOT AND\nTHEN WE GO FROM THERE. >> PANEL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH\nFOR ALL OF YOUR EXPEER RTEXPERT.

WELCOME TO AMERICA'S ELECTION\nHEADQUARTERS FROM WASHINGTON. ALREADY THERE'S A DEBATE BETWEEN\nTHE MAYOR AND GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK, WHETHER THESE BOMBINGS ARE\nINDEED TERRORISM.

THAT GIVES AN INDICATION HOW\nEARLY ON IN THE INVESTIGATION WE ARE.\nMAYOR BILL DE BLASIO AND ANDREW CUOMO VISITED THE SITE WHERE\nTHEY SAW THE DUMPSTER WHERE THIS IED WAS PLACED INSIDE THAT\nDUMPSTER. THEY TOOK A LOOK AND EVEN WENT\nINTO THE BUSINESSES, SPEAKING TO BUSINESS OWNERS TO REASSURE THEM\nEARLIER TODAY. IT GIVES YOU SOME IDEA OF THE\nEXTENT OF THIS BLAST.

EARLIER THAN THAT, NEW YORK\nGOVERNOR ANDREW CUOMO SAID THIS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THIS WAS A\nTERRORIST ATTACK. TAKE A LISTEN.\n>> IT DEPENDS ON YOUR DEFINITION OF TERRORIST.\nEXPLODING IN NEW YORK IS OBVIOUSLY AN ACT OF TERRORISM\nBUT IT'S NOT LINKED TO INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.\nWE FIND NO ISIS CONNECTION, ET CETERA.\n>> Reporter: NOW CUOMO SAID AND REITERATED THAT NEW YORKERS\nSHOULD FEEL SAFE. PERSON OR PERSONS WILL BE\nBROUGHT TO JUSTICE. MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO SAID NEW\nYORKERS CAN EXPECT SECURITY LIKE THEY'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.\nTHE U.N.

NO ONE WAS INJURED AND THE BOMB\nWAS IN A PLASTIC TRASH CAN AND EXPLODED.\nPOLICE SAY THEY DON'T FOR NOW HAVE ANY SUSPECTS IN CUSTODY.\n>> THE FBI IS OFFICIALLY INVOLVED IN THE ONGOING\nINVESTIGATION IN SAINT CLOUD WHERE A MAN DRESSED AS A\nSECURITY GUARD, WENT ON A STABBING RAMPAGE AT THE SHOPPING\nMALL INJURING NINE PEOPLE. THE SUSPECT MADE REFERENCES TO\nALLAH AND ASKED PEOPLE WHETHER THEY WERE MUSLIM BEFORE ATTACKING.\nISIS LINKED MEDIA SAY HE WAS A SOLDIER OF THE ISLAMIC STATE.\nDAN HAS THE LATEST. HI, DAN.\n>> HEY, SHANNON, WE JUST GOT NEW INFORMATION FROM POLICE IN A\nNEWS CONFERENCE A SHORT TIME AGO.\nIT WAS A TERRIFYING FIVE MINUTES IN THAT MINNESOTA MALL AND THE\nFBI SAYS THIS IS A POSSIBLE ACT OF TERRORISM.\nTHE JOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCE IS CONDUCTING THE INVESTIGATION\nALONG WITH THE STXT CLOUD POLICE DEPARTMENT.\nISIS MEDIA HAS PUT OUT THIS STATEMENT, THE EXECUTER OF THE\nATTACKS IN MINNESOTA YESTERDAY WAS A SOLDIER OF THE ISLAMIC\nSTATE AND CARRIED OUT THE OPERATION IN RESPONSE TO CALLS\nTO TARGET THE CITIZENS OF COUNTRIES BELONGING TO\nSADER COULD A LIGS. A MAN WEARING A SECURITY GUARD\nUNIFORM PULLED OUT A KNIFE AND STARTED STABBING PEOPLE.\nPOLICE SAY ONE PERSON WHO WAS ATTACKED WAS ASKED IF HE WAS A\nMUSLIM. OTHERS HEARD THE ATTACKER\nREFERENCE ALLAH. POLICE FOUND THE ATTACKERS CAR\nIN THE PARKING LOT AND CONDUCTED TWO PROPERTY SEARCHES.\nTHE SUSPECT LIVED IN SAINT CLOUD BUT HAD ONLY A FEW CONTACTS WITH\nPOLICE FOR MINOR THINGS LIKE TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS.\nTHEY HAVE NOT RELEASED HIS NAME. >> WE'RE CURRENTLY INVESTIGATING\nTHIS AS A POTENTIAL ACT OF TERRORISM.\nI DO SAY POTENTIAL. THERE'S A LOT WE DON'T KNOW AND\nWE DO NOT AT THIS POINT IN TIME KNOW WHETHER THE SUBJECT WAS IN\nCONTACT WITH HAD CONNECTIONS WITH, WAS INSPIRED BY, A FOREIGN\nTERRORIST ORGANIZATION. >> WE NOW KNOW NINE PEOPLE IN\nALL WERE STABBED, SEVEN MEN AND TWO WOMEN RANGING IN AGE FROM 15\nTO 55. THREE VICTIMS ARE STILL IN THE\nHOSPITAL WITH NONLIFE THREATENING INJURIES.\nPOLICE ARE CREDITING AN OFFDUTY OFFICER FOR SAVING LIVES.\nJASON FALKENER WAS SHOPPING AND ENDED UP SHOOTING AND KILLING\nTHE SUSPECT IN HEROIC FASHION. >> WE'RE A UNITED COMMUNITY AND\nTHERE IS IN THIS INDIVIDUAL EVIL ACT, UNJUSTIFIABLE IN ANY MEANS\nWILL NOT SHAKE THE RESOLVE OF THIS COMMUNITY.\n>> ST. CLOUD IS AN HOUR'S DRIVE FROM MINNEAPOLIS, WHICH HAS BEEN\nA MAJOR FOCUS OF FEDERAL TERROR INVESTIGATIONS DATING BACK\nYEARS. ITS HOME TO THE LARGEST MUSLIM\nSOMALI IN THE U.S., ISIS AND AL QAEDA HAVE DONE\nHEAVY RECRUITING IN THE AREA, NINE HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF\nTERROR RELATED CHARGES. WE'LL HAVE TO SEE IF THIS LATEST\nKNIFE WIELDING ATTACK IS RELATED IN ANY WAY.\n>> THANKS FOR THE UPDATE, DAN. >> NOW FOR MORE ON THIS, ROD\nWHEELER, FORMER WASHINGTON, D.C. METROPOLITAN DETECTIVE AND TALK\nRADIO HOST, APPRECIATE YOU BEING WITH US.\nWISH IT WAS UNDER BETTER CIRCUMSTANCES.\nROD, AS WE LISTEN TOGETHER TO THE NEWS CONFERENCE OUT OF\nMINNESOTA, IT WAS ALMOST SHOCKING TO HEAR THE FBI GUY GO\nTHIS IS A POTENTIAL ACT OF TERRORISM.\nTHEY HAVE HIM TALKING ABOUT ALLAH AND ASKING PEOPLE WHO\nSTABBED, ARE YOU MUSLIM BEFORE STABBING THEM AND ISIS SAYING HE\nWAS A SOLDIER OF THE CALIPHATE. WHAT ELSE DO THEY WANT?\n>> WHAT ELSE DO THEY WANT AND NEED?\nI DON'T LIKE TO SECOND GUESS OTHERS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT, NEVER\nHAVE, NEVER WILL. WE HAVE TO GET TO THE POINT\nLELAND IN THIS COUNTRY WHERE WE CALL SITUATIONS WHAT THEY ARE.\nI MEAN, IF ISIS THINKS THIS GUY IS PART OF THEIR ORGANIZATION,\nWHY DON'T WE THINK THAT? ISIS HAS ALREADY RELEASED A\nSTATEMENT SAYING THIS GUY IS A STUDENT OF THEM.\nWHY AREN'T WE CALLING THIS WHAT IT IS?\nTHEN WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE FACT THAT THIS GUY IS IN AN AREA,\nSAINT CLOUD, MINNESOTA, WHERE WE NODE, THERE'S GROUPS OF\nINDIVIDUALS THAT ARE MUSLIM -- SOMALIS HAVE TALKED ABOUT\nCAUSING HARM TO THE UNITED STATES BEFORE.\nTHERE'S BEEN NINE ARRESTS OVER THE LAST YEAR OR SO WHERE THE\nFBI HAS ARRESTED INDIVIDUALS KNOWN TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH ISIS\nAND OTHER GROUPS. YOU'RE RIGHT, IT'S ABOUT TIME WE\nSTART CALLING THIS WHAT IT IS. >> IT CERTAINLY SEEMS THAT WAY\nAND THERE'S A DEBATE IN NEW YORK WHETHER IT'S TERRORISM OR NOT.\nTHE GOVERNOR SAYS IT IS AND MAYOR SAYS HE DOESN'T KNOW.\nIF YOU TAKE OFF YOUR TALK RADIO HAT AND PUT ON LAW ENFORCEMENT\nHAT, YOU HAVE MINNESOTA, NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY.\nYOU'D HAVE TO BELIEVE IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS TO THINK\nTHAT ALL OF THESE HAPPENING ON THE SAME DAY JUST WAS SO\nCOINCIDENCE. >> YEAH, THERE'S SOME OTHER\nCOMMONALTIES HERE, THESE WERE FAIRLY KIND OF BRUT FORCE\nATTACKS. THESE WEREN'T -- DIDN'T SEEM TO\nBE VERY WELL THOUGHT OUT INCIDENTS.\nIF YOU LOOK AT THE MINNESOTA, IT WAS A KNIFE, DIDN'T HAVE A HIGH\nTECH WEAPON. IF YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER TWO IN\nNEW JERSEY OF THE THREE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES THEY USED,\nONLY ONE WENT OFF. IN NEW YORK OF THE TWO THEY\nUSED, ONLY ONE WENT OFF. WE SEE WHOEVER DID THIS WASN'T\nSOPHISTICATED AND TO ME THE COMMONALTY WASN'T A VERY\nSOPHISTICATED NOR EFFECTIVE ATTACK WHICH LEADS ME TO BELIEVE\nWE'RE LOOKING AT SOMEONE INSPIRED BY ISIS AS OPPOSED TO\nDIRECTLY ABLE TO USE THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND ABILITY.\n>> ROD, IN SOME WAYS IT'S COMFORTING THERE'S NOT A LARGE\nGROUP OF PEOPLE OUT HERE WHO HAVE CELLS OF WELL TRAINED\nHIGHLY SOPHISTICATED OPERATIVES TO CARRY OUT ANOTHER 9/11 ATTACK\nON OTHER HAND IT'S TERRIFYING YOU COULD HAVE ONE GUY IN A\nSHOPPING MALL IN MINNESOTA AND OTHER PEOPLE TINKERING AROUND\nWITH PRESSURE COOKERS IN THE BASEMENTS OFF OF WHAT THEY\nLEARNED IN THE INTERNET AND DO WHAT THEY DID ON SATURDAY NIGHT\nIN AMERICA. >> WE KNOW THE GUY IN THE MALL\nIN MINNESOTA, HE WAS PROBABLY INSPIRED.\nTHEN AGAIN, HE COULD HAVE BEEN AFFILIATED WITH SOME RECOGNIZED\nORGANIZATION. BUT I'VE GOT TO BEG THE\nDIFFERENCE WITH MY CO-PANELISTS IN TERMS OF THE LEVEL OF\nSOPHISTICATION OF THE NEW YORK BOMBING.\nHERE'S WHY I SAY THAT ENAND I'M SURE HE'LL RELATE TO THIS.\nTHESE INDIVIDUALS IN NEW YORK, WHOEVER DID THIS, THIS COULD\nHAVE VERY WELL LELAND HAD BEEN A DRY RUN.\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WAY HE OPERATES AND TYPE OF WEAPONS,\nTHESE ARE HOME MADE BOMBS THEY USE PRESSURE COOKER BOMBS.\nYOU CAN GET MATERIALS AT THE HARDWARE STORE.\nWHEN I LOOK AT THE TARGETS THEY SET OUT FOR LAST NIGHT, EVEN\nSEASIDE NEW JERSEY, IT TELLS ME BY THE FACT THIS WASN'T A\nMASSIVE EXPLOSION, THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT WASN'T SOPHISTICATED.\nWHAT IT MEANS THIS WAS A TEST IN WHAT YOU DO, THIS IS HOW THEY\nOPERATE. THEY TEST LIKE THIS ON A SMALLER\nSCALE AND IN TWO TO THREE WEEKS WE SEE THE REAL BIG BOOM.\n>> TO THAT POINT THAT ROD -- IF THIS WAS A DRY RUN, WHICH IS\nPOSSIBLE, WE DON'T KNOW. TWO OR THREE WEEKS, IS THAT LONG\nENOUGH TO WRAP THIS INVESTIGATION UP?\nYOU THINK ABOUT THE PRESSURE COOKER, MAJOR AMERICAN CITY, YOU\nHAVE BOSTON AS A SCRIPT IN TERMS OF HOW THIS INVESTIGATION COULD\nGO AND ADDED TO THAT THE BENEFIT OF HAVING ONE DEVICE THAT DIDN'T\nEXPLODE, GOT TO GIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT A PRETTY GOOD JUMP\nSTART, IF THIS CELL OR GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS PLANNING MORE\nATTACKS. >> YOU KNOW, YES, CERTAINLY IT'S\nPOSSIBLE THAT THEY ARE, AND I HAD ACTUALLY THOUGHT ABOUT THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF A DRY RUN, BUT IF YOU PUT ALL THREE OF THEM\nTOGETHER, I THINK THAT'S LESS LIKELY WE'RE GOING TO SEE A DRY\nRUN IN THREE CITIES, MAYBE IN ONE, BUT IT IS CERTAINLY\nPOSSIBLE IF THEY WEREN'T CONNECTED, ONE OF THE THREE WERE\nA DRY RUN. BUT I THINK AT ANY RATE, WE'RE\nLOOKING AT FOR THE MOST PART WHAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT IN\nTHE U.S. SO FAR, LONE WOLF ATTACKS AND THEY ARE GOING TO BE\nSPORADIC HERE AND THERE, I USED TO WORK WITH THE FBI JOINT\nTERRORISM TASK FORCE AND UNFORTUNATELY, ONE OF THE\nDISCUSSIONS THAT WE WOULD HAVE WAS THE REALITY THAT IF --\nTHERE'S REALLY LONE WOLF ATTACKERS ARE PRETTY MUCH\nGENERALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO STOP. >> SO DIFFICULT, ESPECIALLY AS\nTHEY CAN COMMUNICATE BACK WITH ISIS BY ENCRYPTED COMMUNICATIONS\nAND THOSE TYPE OF THINGS. THE FBI IS LOOKING AT THE GUY IN\nMINNESOTA'S ELECTRONIC DEVICES AND SOCIAL MEDIA.\nROD, APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE, GARLAN, THANKS FOR STICKING\nAROUND THROUGH THE 3:00 P.M. HOUR.\n>> MORE ON THE MINNESOTA MALL STABBING AS -- SALUTES THE\nATTACKERS, WE'LL TALK ABOUT A FORMER FBI DIRECTOR ABOUT WHAT'S\nNEXT IN THE INVESTIGATION AND IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO KEEP ISIS OUT\nOF THE U.S.      REMEMBER HERE AT ALLY,   NOTHING STOPS US FROM DOING\n  RIGHT BY OUR CUSTOMERS.          WHO'S WITH ME?               I'M IN.\n  I'M IN.\n                         I'M IN.

IF WE CALL YOUR NAME AND YOU ARE\nNOT HERE TO ACCEPT, THE EMMY GOES TO THE NEXT NAME ON THE\nLIST. IT'S CALLED THE MAGGIE SMITH\nRULE. AND THIS, IF YOU DON'T KNOW\nMAGGIE SMITH, SHE HAS BEEN NOMINATED FOR THE EMMY NINE\nTIMES, WON THREE TIMES. HOW MANY TIMES DO YOU THINK\nSHE'S SHOWN UP TO GET THE EMMY? NO TIMES.\nTHIS YEAR, SHE HAD A SUNDAY CERAMICS CLASS SHE COULDN'T GET\nOUT OF. >> AND THE EMMY GOES TO MAGGIE\nSMITH, \"DOWNTON ABBEY.\" >> MAGGIE COULDN'T BE HERE\nTONIGHT SO ACCEPTING THE AWARD ON --\n>> NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

IT'S ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO HAVE\nYOU WITH US. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHO THE BIG\nWINNERS WERE AND WHO WAS EXPECTED TO TAKE HOME THE MOST\nTROPHIES. >> YEAH, WITH THE EMMYS, WHAT\nHAPPENS EVERY YEAR, THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF REPEAT WINNERS\nDESERVEDLY. BUT THEY SEEM TO REPEAT AND WIN\nAGAIN AND AGAIN. I THINK EVERYONE EXPECTED, FOR\nEXAMPLE, \"GAME OF THRONES\" TO WIN FOR BEST DRAMA SERIES.\nIT DEFINITELY DESERVED TO WIN, ONE OF THE MOST TALKED ABOUT\nSHOWS WITH A VERY PASSIONATE FAN BASE.\nTHIS WAS A VERY GOOD WIN FOR BEST DRAMA AND \"VEEP\" WON FOR\nBEST COMEDY YEAR. THIS IS ANOTHER SHOW THEY HAD A\nREALLY, REALLY GOOD YEAR, A REALLY GOOD SEASON.\nI THINK IN A POLITICAL YEAR, I THINK PEOPLE EXPECTED \"VEEP\"\nWOULD WIN AGAIN. AT LEAST IT'S NOT \"MODERN\nFAMILY\" WINNING FOR I THINK FIVE YEARS IN A ROW.\n\"VEEP\" COULD BECOME THE SHOW THAT WINS OVER AND OVER AGAIN.\nJULIETTE LOUIS-DREYFUS WON FOR \"VEEP\" AGAIN BUT SHE HAD A FAK\nYEAR. AND JEFFREY TAM BORE WON FOR\n\"TRANSPARENT\" AGAIN. SO MUCH SO PEOPLE EXPECTED HIM\nTO WIN, JIMMY KIMMEL GAVE HIM HIS AWARD BEFORE THEY EVEN\nSTARRED PASSING OUT AWARDS, HE GAVE HIM HIS AWARD BECAUSE\nEVERYONE ASSUMED HE WOULD PROBABLY WIN AND HE DID.\n>> YOU WOULD THINK WITH ALL OF THE POLITICAL HEADLINES THAT\nWE'RE COVERING HERE THAT PEOPLE WOULD GET ENOUGH WITH POLITICS\nBUT YEAH, \"VEEP\" DOING PRETTY WELL.\nPEOPLE LIKE THOSE POLITICAL SHOWS ESPECIALLY THAT'S WHAT\nPEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. THERE WERE ALSO SOME SURPRISES\nAND NEW FACES. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THOSE?\n>> YEAH, IT WAS FLEISS TO SEE A FEW NEWCOMERS WIN IS ALWAYS\nGREAT. RAMI MALIK WON FOR \"MR. ROBOT.\"\nPEOPLE EXPECTED HIM TO WIN BECAUSE HE'S GOTTEN SO MUCH\nATTENTION. EVERYONE ASSUMED HE WOULD WIN\nAND YOU DON'T HAVE JON HAMM ANYMORE WHO PEOPLE WERE ALWAYS\nTALKING ABOUT SO A LOT OF PERENNIAL WINNERS WEREN'T THERE.\nHE WON DESERVEDLY FOR MR. ROBOT. TATIANA WON FOR ORPHAN BLACK.\nFOR SO MANY YEARS, SHE WAS NEVER EVEN NOMINATED.\nPEOPLE WOULD SAY WHERE IS TATIANA MASANI.\nSHE PLAYS CLONES. SHE'S GOT A REALLY, REALLY TOUGH\nJOB. THIS MADE SENSE SHE FINALLY WON\nAND IT WAS NICE TO SEE TWO NEW FACES.\nALTHOUGH HER NAME WAS KIND OF MISPRO NOUNSDS WHEN SHE WON.\nHOPEFULLY NOW PEOPLE WILL BECOME MORE FAMILIAR WITH HER.\n>> WHAT ABOUT THE NOMINATION OF TRACEE ELLIS ROSS.\n>> THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT TO SEE HER WIN.\n\"BLACK-ISH\" IS SUCH A POPULAR SHOW.\nTHE SHOW WAS NOMINATED. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT TO SEE\nIT NOMINATED. EVEN JIMMY KIMMEL MADE A COMMENT\nABOUT THE DIVERSITY IN THE EMMY NOMINATIONS AS OPPOSED TO WHAT\nPEOPLE TALKS ABOUT WITH THE OSCARS SO WHITISH.\nYOU REALLY DO SEE A LOT OF DIVERSITY WITH THE EMMYS.\nA LOT OF TV SHOWS REFLECT REAL LIFE.\nSO HOPEFULLY, TRACEE ELLIS ROSS WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO WIN.\nBLACKISH IS ON THE AIR FOR A LONG TIME.\nPEOPLE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEE IT WIN THIS TIME AROUND.\nITS TIME WILL BE COMING FOR SURE.\n>> KIM SERAFIN SENIOR EDITOR FROM \"INTOUCH WEEKLY,\" THANK YOU\nSO MUCH.",

THE LATEST ON THE INVESTIGATION\nAFTER THE BOMBING THE NEW YORK SATURDAY NIGHT.\n>> HELLO EVERYONE, I'M GNAT HE ALLEN LIVE IN ATLANTA.\nWE'RE GETTING MORE INFORMATION. THE FBI SAID IT MADE A TRAFFIC\nSTOP WITH POLICE ON SUNDAY OF A VEHICLE OF INTEREST IN THE CASE.\nAS OF NOW WE'RE TOLD THERE ARE NO ARRESTS, NO CHARGES AND THE\nINVESTIGATION IS ON GOING. >> THERE MAY BE ANOTHER CLUE AS\nWELL TO TALK ABOUT. INVESTIGATORS TELLING CNN THAT A\nMAN WAS SEEN IN SURVEILLANCE VIDEO AT THE SIGHT OF THAT\nEXPLOSION. >> AND NEAR WHERE POLICE FOUND A\nPRESSURE COOKER FOUR BLOCKS AWAY.\nIT WAS RIGGED WITH WIRES AND DUCT TAPE AND WHAT APPEARED TO\nBE A CELL PHONE. IT DID NOT EXPLODE AND THEY TOOK\nIT APART. WE'RE ALSO FOLLOWING A SEPARATE\nDEVELOPMENT NOW IN NEW JERSEY. POLICE DETONATED THIS RIGHT\nHERE, IT'S STILL NEW YORK CITY BUT WE'LL GET TO THE NEW JERSEY\nVIDEO IN A MOLT. DETONATED A SUSPICIOUS DEVICE\nFOUND IN A WASTE PASS KET. IT WAS ONE OF UP TO FIVE DEVICES\nDISCOVERED IN A BACKPACK AND THE MEN THAT FOUND IT SAW WIRES AND\nA PIPE AND CONTACTED AUTHORITIES.\nTHE STATE POLICE ARE INVESTIGATING AND I BELIEVE THEY\nWERE FOUND NEAR A TRAIN STATION? >> NEAR A TRAIN STATION AND\nTRAIN SERVICE HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE.\nIT'S THAT OLD SAYING SEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING.\n>> THEY'RE ALERT RIGHT NOW. INVESTIGATORS THEY ARE ON HIGH\nALERT LOOKING FOR ANYTHING AND CERTAINLY OUR CORR ADDRESS\nSPONTANEOUS DENS WE ARE OUT IN FULL FORCE.\nFOLLOWING THE DEVELOPMENTS IN NEW YORK.\nALSO RACHEL CRANE IS IN ELIZABETH NEW JERSEY WITH MORE\nON THAT SUSPICIOUS PACKAGE THAT WAS FOUND.\nLET'S GO TO RACHEL FIRST. >> WELL, GEORGE, WE'RE HERE IN\nHE ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY. WE JUST SPOKE TO THE MAYOR ABOUT\nTHIS ON GOING SITUATION. HE DESCRIBED WHAT HAPPENED HERE\nTHIS EVENING. HE SAID THAT TWO GENTLEMEN SAW A\nBACKPACK IN A TRASH CAN VERY CLOSE TO A LOCAL PUB AND ALSO\nVERY CLOSE TO THE TRAIN STATION HERE.\nTHEY OPENED THE BACKPACK THINKING THEY WOULD FIND\nSOMETHING VALUABLE AND INSTEAD THEY FOUND A VERY SUSPICIOUS\nLOOKING DEVICE WITH WIRES COMING OUT OF IT.\nTHAT'S WHEN THEY DROPPED THAT BACKPACK AND WENT AROUND THE\nCORNER TO THE LOCAL POLICE STATION.\nTHE LOCAL AUTHORITIES RESPONDED AND THAT'S WHEN THEY ALSO\nCONFIRMED THAT PACKAGE WAS SUSPICIOUS LOOKING.\nAS YOU CAN SEE THIS WAS OBVIOUSLY STILL AN ON GOING\nSITUATION. THAT'S WHEN THEY ALSO THEN THE\nLOCAL AUTHORITIES CALLED IN THE BOMB SQUAD AS WELL AS THE FBI.\nNOW THE MAYOR ALSO TOLD US THAT THAT BACKPACK, THE DEVICES\nINSIDE UP TO FIVE DEVICES BUT ALSO DESCRIBED TO US WHEN ONE OF\nTHE ROBOTS ACCIDENTALLY DETONATED ONE.\nTAKE A LISTEN. >> THE ROBOTS THAT WERE GOING IN\nTO DISARL IT CUT A WIRE AND IT EXPLODED.\nAND I KNOW THERE'S OTHER DEVICES.\nI DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR MADE UP OF BUT THEY'LL HAVE TO BE\nREMOVED. ALL THE FRAGMENTS IN THE OTHER\nPIECE HAVE TO BE PICKED UP SO THE FBI CAN INVESTIGATE THIS\nFULLY. >> THEY WENT ON TO SAY THERE'S\nNO TIMER AND NO CELL PHONE CONNECTED TO THOSE DEVICES.\nNOW THE AREA HERE, THE STREETS HAVE ALL BEEN CLOSED DOWN.\nTRAIN SERVICE HAS BEEN SUSPENDED BETWEEN NEW YORK HIBERTY AIRPORT\nAND ELIZABETH NEW JERSEY. UNCLEAR WHEN IT WILL BE RESTORED\nBUT CERTAINLY EVERYBODY HERE IN HE ELIZABETH NEW JERSEY, ALL THE\nLOCAL AUTHORITIES RESPONDING TO THE SITUATION AND ON HEIGHTENED\nALERT. >> YEAH AND IT'S ABOUT TO BE A\nMONDAY MORNING COMMUTER TIME SO THIS IS ANOTHER DISRUPTION.\nHOW FAR IS ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY FROM MANHATTAN?\n>> IT TOOK US ABOUT 30 MINUTES TO GET HERE NATALIE THIS\nEVENING. THAT OBVIOUSLY WITH NO TRAFFIC.\nSO IT'S NOT TOO FAR BUT IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT A STONE'S THROW\nAWAY. >> OKAY.\nRACHEL CRANE FOR US THERE. OBVIOUSLY VERY ACTIVE SCENE AT\nTHE INVESTIGATION WITH THE FIRE TRUCK GOING RIGHT PAST HER AS\nSHE SPOKE. >> ALSO IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT\nTHAT SITUATION IN NEW JERSEY NOT BEING CONNECTED AT THIS POINT TO\nTHE SITUATION IN MANHATTAN AND THAT'S WHERE WE WANT TO GO NOW\nLIVE TO DEBORAH FOLLOWING THE INVESTIGATION IN NEW YORK.\nDEBORAH, SO, YOU KNOW, TALK TO US, IF YOU COULD ABOUT THE\nLATEST, WE UNDERSTAND THIS TRAFFIC STOP WAS MADE ON A\nBRIDGE THAT HAS BEEN CONNECTED TO THE BOMBING INCIDENT.\nTHE EXPLOSION. >> WELL THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.\nIT'S UNCLEAR WHAT SPECIFICALLY LEAD INVESTIGATORS BOTH FROM THE\nFBI AND THE NYPD TO MAKE THIS PARTICULAR TRAFFIC STOP BUT THEY\nWERE STOPPED ON THE BRIDGE AND THAT BRIDGE CONNECTS STATEN\nISLAND WITH BROOKLYN BUT IF YOU GO IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION YOU\nCAN GET TO NEW JERSEY. SO THERE'S LINKS BETWEEN THE\nDIFFERENT AREAS WHERE THESE DEVICES SEEM TO BE SHOWING UP\nAND YOU GOT LAW ENFORCEMENT, HUNDREDS OF MEN AND WOMEN WHO\nARE REALLY THINKING ABOUT WHAT THESE DEVICES ARE AND HOW THEY\nCOULD POTENTIALLY BE CONNECTED AND THIS IS ALL PUT OF THE\nINVESTIGATION. WE CAN TELL YOU YOURS IS IN\nTOTALITY. YOU HAD THREE DEVICES FOUND\nYESTERDAY, SATURDAY. TWO IN MANHATTAN.\nONE IN NEW JERSEY. ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF FROM\nTHE LOCATION OF THE OTHER DEVICES BUT NOW YOU GOT THESE IN\nELIZABETH NEW JERSEY AND JUST TO PUT IT IN CONTEXT, HE LIZ PELTH,\nNEW JERSEY IS ABOUT FIVE MILES FROM NEWARK AIRPORT AND THAT'S\nWHY YOU HAVE THAT STRETCH FROM ELIZABETH TO NEWARK CLOSE DOWN\nRIGHT NOW BUT THEY'RE LOOKING AT ALL OF THIS TO SEE WHETHER\nTHERE'S SIMILARITIES IN THE DEVICES.\nWE DO KNOW THE DEVICES APPEAR TO HAVE HAD A CELL PHONE ATTACHED\nTO THEM. BUT THE ONES IN NEW JERSEY WERE\nONLY ONE OF THE THREE PIPE BOMBS DETONATED YESTERDAY.\nAND THESE ARE THE COMMONALITIES AND IT HAPPENS TO MAKE A GREAT\nCONSEQUENCE AND I SPOKE TO A SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL\nEARLIER TODAY. WHEN YOU HAVE THESE YOU HAVE TO\nLOOK MORE DEEPLY BECAUSE IT DOESN'T USUALLY BREAK THAT WAY.\n>> WE'RE SEEING THIS CAR THAT THEY WERE INVESTIGATING AND I\nKNOW YOU WERE STANDING THERE EARLIER REPORTING ON WHAT WAS\nGOING ON. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT.\n>> THERE'S THE FACT THAT THIS CAR HAD NEW JERSEY LICENSE\nPLATES. YESTERDAY IN NEW JERSEY THE\nQUESTION WAS COULD THAT BE CONNECTED?\nAND WHY IS IT IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA OF WHERE THESE DEVICES\nFOUND IN MANHATTAN. IT COULD ALSO BE THAT THIS CAR\nHAS SHRAPNEL IN IT. CLEARLY THERE'S EVIDENCE.\nYOU CAN SEE THERE WAS A WOMAN THERE TAKING A LOT OF\nPHOTOGRAPHS AND WORKING AT DIFFERENT MARKS AND THINGS IN\nTHE CAR AND TOOK IT AWAY FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS.\nSO THAT WAS A PARTICULAR INTEREST.\nTHE FACT THAT IT WAS PARKED ON 23rd STREET JUST A BLOCK FROM\nWHERE THAT DEVICE DETONATED THAT IS ALSO OF INTEREST.\nHOW IT ENDED UP THERE. SO INVESTIGATORS NOW ARE GETTING\nENOUGH CLUES AND ENOUGH DETAILS THAT THEY CAN BEGIN TO SORT OF\nSPIDER OUT FROM THERE AND LOOK AT HOW THE THREADS CONNECT.\n>> AND THEY HAVE THAT VIDEO SURVEILLANCE AS WELL.\nIT'S CERTAINLY ON GOING. >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR REPORTING.\nRACHEL CRANE ON THE SCENE IN ELIZABETH NEW JERSEY.\nWE'LL STAY IN TOUCH WITH YOU BOTH.\n>> JUST BEFORE THAT EXPLOSION WENT OFF AT NEW YORK STABBINGS\nAT A SHOPPING MALL IN STFLT CLOUD, MINNESOTA.\nWOUNDED AT LEAST 9 PEOPLE. ONE CRITICALLY.\nTHE FBI IS INVESTIGATING THAT INCIDENT AS A POTENTIAL ACT OF\nTERROR. ONE WITNESS THAT WORKED AT THE\nMALL DESCRIBED WHAT SHE SAW. LISTEN.\n>> ALL OF A SUDDEN CHAOS JUST BROKE OUT.\nTHERE IS A BUNCH OF PEOPLE RUNNING INTO THE JCPENNEY MALL\nENTRANCE AND THEY WERE JUST SCREAMING THAT SOMEONE WAS GOING\nAROUND THE MALL STABBING PEOPLE AND THAT THERE WAS BLOOD\nEVERYWHERE. AND IT WAS JUST HONESTLY A\nREALLY SCARY THING AND TROPICAL WAVED EVERYTHING AND BOOKED IT\nBACK TO MY CO-WORKER TO NOTIFY HER WHAT WAS GOING ON.\nI RAN OUT A DIFFERENT EXIT OUT OF OUR JCPENNEYS THAT LEAD\nSTRAIGHT TO THE PARKING LOT AND I JUMPED INTO MY CAR AND RAN OFF\nAS FAST AS I COULD. >> THAT HAD TO BE TERRIFYING.\nPOLICE SAY THE ATTACKER APPEARS TO HAVE ACTED ALONE.\nTHE CITY'S MAYOR PRAISED THE OFF DUTY POLICE OFFICER THAT SHOT\nAND KILLED THE ATTACKER. >> HE CLEARLY PREVENTED\nADDITIONAL INJURIES AND LOSS OF LIFE.\nHIS HEROIC ACTIONS OR HAVING WITNESSED WHAT HE DID AND THE\nSUSPECT IS LUNGING WITH HIM AND NOT ONLY DID HE FIRE BUT THE\nSUSPECT WENT DOWN AND CAME BACK UP ON THREE DIFFERENT OCCASIONS.\n>> SO IF YOU'RE COUNTING THERE'S A SITUATION THERE IN MINNESOTA.\nTWO SITUATIONS IN NEW JERSEY. AND WE'RE DISCOVERING TONIGHT\nAND ALSO CERTAINLY NEW YORK. FRONT AND CENTER.\nTHERE WAS NO CLEAR LINK BETWEEN ALL THE ATTACKS THROUGHOUT THE\nU.S. IT'S THE TIMING RAISING A LOT OF\nCONCERN. >> WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE TIMING\nTHAT IS INTERESTING TO YOU? >> FIRST OF ALL IT'S ALL\nHAPPENING SO FAST. ALL WITHIN THE PERIOD OF 24\nHOURS THIS IS ALL TAKING PLACE AND ORDINARILY I WOULD PUT THE\nTIMING TO OCTOBER AND OCTOBER WAS ALWAYS THE MONTH WHERE WE\nWERE NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE AS MUCH LOCATION.\nTIME OFF WAS LIMITED AND YOU COULDN'T SCHEDULE THINGS BECAUSE\nOF THE GENERAL IS SEMIBLI. AND MOVING ALL AROUND THE CITY\nSO YOU HAVE EXTRA SECURITY FROM THOSE COUNTRIES COMING IN.\nYOU HAVE EXTRA SECRET SERVICE. A STATE DEPARTMENT DIPLOMATIC\nSECURITY AND IT WAS A HUGE COORDINATION EFFORT AND THEN\nWHEN YOU HAVE THESE THINGS TAKING PLACE AT THE SAME TIME\nTHAT JUST HEIGHTENED EVERYBODY'S AWARENESS.\n>> I'D LIKE TO GET YOUR SENSE OF THINGS SO I'M SURE YOU HEARD OUR\nCORRESPONDENT REPORTING THERE AND WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?\n>> I'M SURE THAT THERE ARE ALL OF THESE INCIDENCES PROPERLY\nBEING WORKED CLOSELY TOGETHER. AND IT'S PROBABLY IN CONSTANT\nCONTACT WITH THE JTTF IN NEW YORK AND THEY'RE PROBABLY\nTRADING IN NEW YORK. ALL OF THEM WILL GO QUICKLY TO\nBE EXAMINED IF FOR COMMONALITIES AND THEY'LL KNOW IT AS QUICKLY\nAS THEY CAN GET IT DOWN THERE. NOBODY WILL REST.\nEVERYBODY WILL BE WORKING ON THIS THING CONSTANTLY BUT AS\nIT'S MOVING FORWARD MORE INCIDENTS KEEP HAPPENING AS WE\nSPEAK SO IT'S GOING TO BE A BUSY TIME.\n>> CERTAINLY AND THE PRESSURE IS ON TO TRY TO BRING THIS TO A\nCONCLUSION. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE FACT\nTHAT THEY HAVE SURVEILLANCE VIDEO.\nTHEY HAVE SOMEONE SUSPICIOUS IN THE VIDEO BUT THEY'RE NOT\nRELEASING IT TO THE PUBLIC FOR ANY HELP.\n>> I THINK THAT MIGHT INDICATE THAT THEY HAVE WHAT THEY FEEL IS\nENOUGH TO PROVIDE THEM WITH WHAT THEY NEED TO IDENTIFY THE PERSON\nSO IN OTHER WORDS YOU ONLY GO OUT TO THE PUBLIC IF YOU NEED TO\nGO OUT TO THE PUBLIC. IF THERE'S ENOUGH IN THAT VIDEO\nFOR THEM TO IDENTIFY THE INDIVIDUAL OR IF THEY CAN TO IT\nIN A LESS PUBLIC WAY, THEY CAN TWO TO CERTAIN PEOPLE THAT THEY\nTHINK MIGHT KNOW THAT INDIVIDUAL THEN THEY CAN DO THAT.\nTHE LESS YOU CAN MAKE PUBLIC IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ADDITIONAL\nCO-CONSPIRATORS IT'S DIFFERENT AT THAT POINT.\n>> I WANT TO GET SOME CONTEXT FROM YOU GIVEN YOUR EXPERIENCE\nIN THIS ARENA. THE PRECISION THAT GOES INTO A\nTRAFFIC STOP THAT HAPPENS ON A BRIDGE, TALK TO US ABOUT THAT.\nAND NO ONE HAS OPINION CHARGED WITH ANYTHING BUT WE DO\nUNDERSTAND THIS IS BEING CON NECKED TO THE SITUATION, THAT\nEXPLOSION IN NEW YORK. >> CLEARLY SOMETHING LEAD THEM\nTO THAT VEHICLE AND THEN THEY GOT ON TO THE VEHICLE AND\nTRAFFIC STOPS ARE ALWAYS A DANGEROUS THING FOR ANY POLICE\nOFFICER TO ENGAGE IN. THE BRIDGE MAY HAVE BEEN THE\nPERFECT TIME TO DO IT BECAUSE YOU HAVE MORE CONTROL OVER WHERE\nTHE CAR IS GOING TO GO. THEY MIGHT HAVE COVERAGE AT BOTH\nENDS OF THE BRIDGE. THEY CAN DELAY TRAFFIC IN THE\nAREA EASILY. MORE EASILY ON A BRIDGE.\nSO IT'S A MORE CONTROLLED VIERLT WHEN YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING LIKE\nTHAT AND THE FACT THAT THE NYPD AND THE FBI WERE DOING IT\nTOGETHER JOINTLY ADDS TO THE SAFETY FACTOR FOR THE OFFICERS\nINVOLVED. >> WE APPRECIATE YOU JOINING US\nTO HELP US UNDERSTAND THIS PROCESS.\nTHANK YOU BOBBY. >> BOBBY, THANK YOU.\nYOU'RE WATCHING CNN NEWSROOM.

THE NORTHEAST CORRIDOR IS A\nVERY, VERY BUSY TRANSPORTATION HUB.\nTHIS IS 750,000 PEEL TRAVELLED ON THE NORTHEAST CORRIDOR EVERY\nSINGLE DAY. TOMORROW IS MONDAY MORNING.\nI'M CLEAR OF WHEN THAT SERVICE WILL BE REINSTATED.\nAND THE STREETS ALL AROUND THE SURROUNDING AREA HAVE BEEN\nTURNED OUT. THEY ALSO TOLD US THEY DID A\nSECONDARY SWEEP OF THE SURROUNDING AREA MAKING SURE\nTHAT THERE WERE NO OTHER SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES FOUND AND\nSAID THERE WAS NOTHING FOUND AND THEY WERE JUST WORKING ON\nSECURING THIS AREA. ALSO IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT\nTHERE HAS BEEN NO CONNECTION MADE WITH ANY OF THE OTHER\nINSTANCES OF BOMBS EITHER DETONATING OR BEING FOUND YET\nBUT IT IS IS IMPORTANT TO ALSO POINT OUT THAT IN THE STATE OF\nNEW JERSEY THERE HAVE BEEN TWO BOMBS OBVIOUSLY THE ONE\nYESTERDAY THAT WAS FOUND IN THE TRASH CAN IN SEASIDE THAT\nDETONATED ALSO IN THAT TRASH CAN AND OBVIOUSLY NOBODY WAS\nINJURED. THAT WAS AT A MARINE CORPS RACE\nAND THEN HERE THIS WEEKEND, LUCKILY IN BOTH INSTANCES NOBODY\nWAS INJURED. GEORGE AND NATALIE.\n>> EARLY MORNING HERE FOR YOU. OBVIOUSLY THE INVESTIGATORS\nDISCOVERED THIS AFTER A TIP SOMEONE SAW SOMETHING.\nSOMEONE SAID SOMETHING. THAT IS THE SAYING AND IT WORKED\nOUT BUT ALL OF THIS HAPPENING AND EFFECTING TRAIN SERVICE.\nWILL THAT CONTINUE TO EFFECT PEOPLE AS WE AT SOME POINT GET\nINTO THE RUSH HOUR TIME. THE RUSH HOUR COMMUTE.\n>> WE DON'T YET KNOW WHEN THE TRAINS WILL BE UP AND RUNNING\nAGAIN. THIS IS NORTHEAST CORRIDOR.\n750,000 PEOPLE RIDE DAILY. SO CERTAINLY PEOPLE SHOULD CHECK\nINTO WHAT THEIR DAILY COMMUTE WILL BE LIKE AS IT PROBABLY WILL\nBE DISRUPTED BY THIS INCIDENT. >> I GOT A TEXT FROM A FRIEND ON\nTHE TRAIN FROM D.C. TO NEW YORK CITY AND DIDN'T MAKE IT TO\nMANHATTAN BUT THERE'S JUST ONE STORY THERE.\nTHANK YOU RACHEL. >> WELL, GOVERNORS IN SIX U. S.\nSTATES DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY OVER RISING GASOLINE\nPRICES. A PIPELINE THAT PROVIDES FUEL\nFOR ABOUT 50 MILLION AMERICANS EVERY DAY HAS BEEN SHUTDOWN\nAFTER A LEAK WAS FOUND IN ALABAMA.\n>> THIS COULD EFFECT A LOT OF PEEL.\nTHAT COMPANY THAT OPERATES THE PIPELINE SAYS THAT THE SPILL IS\nCONTAINED TO A POUND. SOME SERVICE STATIONS HAVE RUN\nOUT OF GAS. THE COMPANY SAYS IT IS BUILDING\nA BYPASS LINE TO GET THAT FUEL FLOWING AGAIN BUT A LOT OF\nPEOPLE GOT THIS NEWS AND THEY'RE CONCERNED THAT GAS PRICES COULD\nGO UP AND COULD BE HARD TO GET GAS SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS\nEFFECTING MANY PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT STATES.\n>> LOOK AT THE PICTURE. SO THERE'S AN ENVIRONMENTAL\nCONCERN AS WELL THERE. IF YOU HAVE A SAMSUNG PHONE YOU\nNEED A NEW ONE. SAMSUNG HAS BEGUN REPLACING IT'S\nGALAXY NOTE 7 SMARTPHONE. WAS FORCED TO RECALL DEVICES\nSOLD WORLDWIDE AFTER REPORTS OF BATTERY FIRES SURFACED ONLINE.\n>> HEY YOUTUBE. I JUST WANTED TO POST THIS AND\nSHARE WHAT JUST HAPPENED TO MY NOTE 7.\nAND A LITTLE BIT BEFORE I HAD CLASS.\n>> THAT KIND OF TELLS THE STORY. THERE'S A LOT OF STORIES LIKE\nTHAT BUT THAT SAYS IT ALL. THE PICTURE OF THAT ONE.\nPAULA HANDCOCKS IS LIVE WHERE THE COMPANY IS OFFERING A MAKE\nGOOD TO ITS CUSTOMERS. THAT IS THE HOME BASE FOR\nSAMSUNG. HELLO THERE PAULA.\n>> IT IS A VERY BIG WEEK AND YOU CAN'T UNDERESTIMATE THIS WEEK.\nTODAY MONDAY CUSTOMERS CAN COME INTO A SHOP LIKE THIS IN THE\nBUSINESS DISTRICT AND ACTUALLY EXCHANGE THEIR GALAXY NOTE 7 FOR\nA NEW ONE. YOU CAN SEE THE RESPONSE AT THIS\nONE IS UNDERWHELMING. IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT THERE'S\nHUNDREDS OF SHOTS AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT CAN EXCHANGE THEIR\nPHONES BUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE COMING IN ON\nTHE FIRST DAY WHICH YOU MIGHT EXPECT CONSIDERING REGULATORS\nHAVE ACTUALLY BANNED THIS PHONE FROM PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND ALSO\nPOWER DOWN THESE DEVICES UNTIL YOU'RE ABLE TO EXCHANGE THEM AND\nSAFETY CONCERNS. AND 4:00 IN THE AFTERNOON.\n3 PEOPLE SO FAR HAVE EXCHANGED THEIR PHONE HERE.\nMANY MORE HAVE COME IN TO SEE IF THEY CAN EXCHANGE THEIR PHONE.\nYOU HAVE TO GO TO THE PLACE WHERE YOU BOUGHT IT FROM WHICH\nMANY PEOPLE SEEM TO REALIZE. ONE WOMAN CAME IN AND BROUGHT IT\nONLINE AND YOU WERE TOLD YOU HAVE TO SEND IT BACK TO THE\nPACKAGES. YOU CAN'T JUST COME INTO ANY\nSHOP AROUND THE COUNTRY. WE ALSO HAD ONE MAN THAT BROUGHT\nIT FROM HERE AND TRIED TO EXCHANGE IT.\nHE BROUGHT IT LATER ON SO HE HAS TO WAIT ANOTHER FEW DAYS OR\nWEEKS UNTIL HE CAN GET HIS REPLACEMENT.\nTHERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF CONFUSION ON DAY ONE.\nBUT THEY'RE CERTAINLY HOPING THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE A\nTURNING POINT FOR THIS PR DISASTER THAT THEY HAVE\nUNDERGONE. WE HAVE SEEN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF\nLOYALTY FROM CUSTOMERS THAT HAVE COME IN HERE.\nYOU MIGHT EXPECT IT. THIS IS SOUTH KOREA.\nTHIS IS THE BIRTH PLACE AND AT LEAST THREE OR FOUR PEOPLE AND\nEVEN THOUGH THEY WERE ANNOYED THEY COULDN'T EXCHANGES THAT\nPHONE STRAIGHT AWAY. THEY STAYED WITH SAMPSON.\nTHEY HAVE THAT LOYALTY AND SHOULD BE INTERESTING OVER THE\nNEXT FEW DAYS IN EUROPE WHEN THOSE EXCHANGES HAPPENED WHETHER\nOR NOT THAT LOYALTY EXTENDS BEYOND THE HOME STATE OF\nSAMPSON. >> I'M SURE THOSE FEW REPORTS\nMEANS A LOT. AS YOU SAY THIS IS A POLITICAL\nPR NIGHTMARE. >> THANK YOU, PAULA HANDCOCK\nTHERE. >> IT'S GETTING EVEN BUSIER NOW.\nANOTHER TYPHOON IS HEADED TO THE REGION.\nOUR METEOROLOGIST IS LIVE. >> BACK TO BACK TYPHOONS.\n>> THIS HAS BEEN VERY, VERY BUSY IDENTIFIES.\nIT'S SOMETHING THAT'S GETTING A LOT OF PEOPLE CONCERNED BECAUSE\nTHEY'RE NOT GETTING A BREAK AND THIS PARTICULAR ONE AND IT'S\nCERTAINLY THE CASE. EQUIVALENT TO A CATEGORY 3\nFEATURE. I WANT TO SHOW YOU WHAT'S\nHAPPENING HERE. NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SIX\nSTORMS THAT MADE LAND FALL ACROSS PORTIONS OF JAPAN SINCE\nTHE FIFTH OF AUGUST. WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT AMOUNT OF\nDAYS AND THE DAMAGE THAT'S LEFT IN PLACE THE SOIL IS FULLY\nSATURATED AND CANNOT USE ANY MORE MOISTURE AND THIS WOULD\nMAKE LAND FALL. AND THE OVERNIGHT HOURS GOING\nINTO TUESDAY MORNING. AND ACTIVE WEATHER THIS TIME OF\nTHE YEAR. AND IT TAKES AN UNFORTUNATE\nTRACK IN THE SENSE THAT IT PARALLELS AND IMPACTS PARTS OF\nEASTERN JAPAN AND IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THESE PREFECTURES\nTHESE ARE THE MOST DENSELY POPULATED AREAS OF JAPAN AND\nTOKYO GETS THIS WHEN IT COMES TO HEAVY RAINFALL AND GUSTY WINDS\nAND 24 DEGREES. AND THE THEME IS VERY CLEAR.\nRAINFALL AND LOTS OF IT EACH OF THE NEXT FOUR TO FIVE DAYS\nACROSS THE REGION OF JAPAN. AND THIS IS WHAT IS LEFT OF THE\nTROPICAL STORM PAINE. IT'S EXPECTED TO WEAKEN AND THE\nSTORM SYSTEM PARALLELS BAJA CALIFORNIA AND ACTUALLY COULD\nBRING IN SOME RAINFALL ON THE FINAL DAY OF SUMMER.\nTHAT WOULD BE ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON ACROSS SAN DIEGO.\nAND INTO SOUTHERN ARIZONA AS WELL.\nAND THE LAST FEW DAYS OF SUMMER AND EASTERN UNITED STATES IN\nFACT FROM NEW YORK CITY OUT TOWARD WASHINGTON AND HEAVY\nRAINFALL GOING OUT THIS AFTERNOON AND COULD GET SOME\nVERY HEAVY RAINFALL AND THIS IS AN AREA STRICKEN BY DROUGHT AS\nMUCH AS THE EASTERN U.S. HAS AND ANY RAINFALL IS BENEFICIAL\nACROSS THIS REGION. LOOK AT THESE TEMPERATURES.\nWE GET THE RAIN THAT COMES IN MONDAY IN NEW YORK.\nAND TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 70s AND THEN A NICE BRIEF SPIKE\nTHERE IN TEMPERATURES GEORGE AND NATALIE.\nWE'RE TALKING MID 80s. SHOULD BE IN THE MID 70s TO A\nHOT WAY TO END WHAT HAS BEEN THE HOTTEST SUMMER ON RECORD WHEN\nIT'S ALL SAID AND DONE. >> NOT SURPRISING.\n>> LOOKED GOOD THOUGH TO SEE 70 DOESN'T IT.\n>> YES, YOU CAN FEEL IT IN THE AIR.\n>> THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU.\n>> THE UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY STOPS IN NEW YORK THIS WEEK AND ON THE\nSIDELINES WILL BE A FIRST OF ITS KIND GLOBAL SUMMIT.\n>> THAT SUMMIT AIMED AT ENDING SCENES LIKE THIS AND FINDING A\nBETTER WAY TO HANDLE THE MIGRANT AND REFUGEE CRISIS.\nWE'LL HAVE MORE ABOUT THAT COMING UP.",

JUST ONE.\nAT ONE POINT, JUST SEVERAL HOURS AGO, THEY WERE ABLE TO CONTAIN\nIT AND PUT IT IN A PROTECTIVE CONTAINER.\nIT IS SAFE.

POLICE AND THE FBI APPARENTLY\nMADE A TRAFFIC STOP SUNDAY NIGHT, A SHORT TIME AGO AND\nTHEIR INVESTIGATION OF THIS WEEKEND'S BOMBING ATTACK IN\nMANHATTAN. FIVE PEOPLE WERE PULLED OVER BUT\nAS OF NOW, WE'RE TOLD NO ARRESTS HAVE BEEN MADE.\nNO CHARGES FILED. 29 PEOPLE WERE INJURED IN\nSATURDAY'S EXPLOSION AS A RESULT NEW YORK'S GOVERNOR IS ADDING\n1,000 MORE POLICE AND TROOPS TO PATROL BUS TERMINALS, AIRPORTS\nAND SUBWAY STATIONS. BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL SOMEBODY\nOUT THERE AND PLACE THESE EXPLOSIONS AND THEY DON'T HAVE\nTHEM YET. OUR CNN INVESTIGATIVE PRODUCER\nHAS BEEN WORKING THE SCENE NOW EVER SINCE THE STORY BROKE AND\nYOU'RE STILL TALKING WITH SOURCES.\nWHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THIS TRAFFIC STOP AND WHAT PERHAPS\nWERE THEIR SUSPICIONS? >> WE FIRST LEARNED OF THIS\nMAYBE AROUND AN HOUR OR SO AGO. A LOCAL STATE SENATOR HAD\nTWEETED THAT SOME -- ABOUT FIVE PEOPLE WERE QUESTIONED BY THE\nFBI. THEY WERE TAKEN INTO CUSTODY AND\nTHE FBI, THE ONLY THING THAT WE'RE CONFIRMING AT THIS HOUR IS\nTHAT THEY DID, IN FACT, STOP A CAR.\nTHEY WANTED TO QUESTION, THEY DID PULL THEM OVER AND THEY DID\nQUESTION THEM. WE BELIEVE THEY HAVE BEEN TAKEN\nBACK TO THE FBI OFFICES AND THE FBI STRESSED TO US THAT YES\nWHILE IT IS RELATED TO THE EXPLOSION THAT OCCURRED HERE IN\nMANHATTAN THE MEN HAVE NOT BEEN CHARGED AND NO ONE HAS BEEN\nARRESTED. >> WHILE YOU WERE TALKING WE\nWERE SHOWING VIDEO OF POLICE SURROUNDING A CAR THAT HAD BEEN\nROPED OFF WITH POLICE TAPE. THAT'S NOT THE CAR THEY PULLED\nOVER, RIGHT? THEY'RE INVESTIGATING A CAR THEY\nFOUND PARKED SOMEWHERE IN MANHATTAN.\n>> YEAH. SO ALL DAY LONG THERE'S BEEN\nDIFFERENT CARS THEY HAVE INVESTIGATED.\nSOME OF THE CARS JUST HAPPENED TO BE HIT BY SHRAPNEL.\nAND WE DO NOT HAVE ANY INDICATION BY LAW ENFORCEMENT\nTHAT THE PEOPLE OR THE PERSON BEHIND THE EXPLOSION WAS DRIVING\nA CAR. SO WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE\nRELATIONSHIP IS TO THE CAR AND THE CRIME SCENE.\nAND THEY FELT LIKE THEY NEEDED TO TAKE IT BACK TO EXAMINE IT\nFURTHER BUT BESIDES THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY FURTHER\nINFORMATION. >> DO WE KNOW IF THERE'S STILL\nROADS SHUTDOWN IN THIS AREA? CLOSED OFF?\nWE'RE ABOUT TO HIT A MONDAY HORNG IN NEW YORK CITY.\n>> I THINK WE EXPECT ALL THE ROADS TO BE OPEN BY TOMORROW\nMORNING OR BY THE MORNING I SHOULD SAY.\nTRAFFIC IS SLOWLY BEING REOPENED AND LIFE IS, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE\nTRYING TO SORT OF RESTORE LIFE BACK IN THIS COMMUNITY AND LET\nPEOPLE GET BACK INTO THEIR HOMES AND LIVE THEIR LIVES.\nSORT OF I GUESS RESTORE SOME KIND OF NORMALCY BUT EVERYTHING\nSHOULD BE REOPENED BY TOMORROW. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT LAW\nENFORCEMENT IS GOING TO LEAVE THE AREA.\nTHEY'RE STILL TALKING TO THEM INSIDE THE BUILDING.\nI THINK LAW ENFORCEMENT IS GOING TO REMAIN THERE BUT IT'S A\nQUESTION OF HOW MUCH LONGER BUT I THINK THE STREETS WILL ALL BE\nREOPENED BY TOMORROW. >> ONE OF OUR EXPERTS SAID\nPERHAPS THEY'RE NOT RELEASING THIS VIDEO BECAUSE THEY HAVE\nENOUGH TO GO ON RIGHT NOW. WE HOPE THAT'S THE CASE BECAUSE\nEVEN THOUGH NEW YORKERS GET BACK IN THERE THERE CERTAINLY HAS TO\nBE TENSION OR WORRY THAT WHOEVER DID THIS HAS NOT BEEN INVOLVED\nAT THIS POINT. THANK YOU SO MUCH.\n>> THE SUMMER GAMES HAVE BEEN HANDED OVER TO TOKYO WITH THE\nCLOSING CEREMONY HAS JUST WRAPPED UP AND WE'LL TELL YOU\nHOW THEY FINISHED ON A POIGNANT NOTE.\nWE'LL HAVE THAT STORY RIGHT AFTER THIS.",

YOU ARE SO RIGHT THAT YOU NEED\nTO HAVE COMPENSATIONS STRUCTURES THAT ARE VALID AND ALLOW PEOPLE\nTO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY AND WHEN YOU BLOW IT WITH THINGS LIKE\nTHIS, YOU UNDERMINE WHAT IS VALID ABOUT CORPORATE\nCOMPENSATION. >> LET'S DIG INTO THE DETAILS\nWHY THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT STRUCTURES.\nEPIPEN ITSELF, THIS IS A SITUATION THAT WOULD COST, WHAT,\n$29 TO MAKE. >> $29 TO MAKE THE PEN, YES.\n>> AND IT GOT JACKED UP TO ABOUT $600 BECAUSE OF WHAT\nCOMPENSATION STRUCTURE? >> I THINK THAT WHEN YOU LOOK\nRIGHT AFTER WHAT THEY PUT IN FOR TOP EXECUTIVES, A COMPENSATION\nSTRUCTURE THAT WOULD ALLOW, YOU KNOW, BIG, BIG BONUSES IF THERE\nWERE PROFITS, AND THAT'S WHEN THEY MOVE FROM UPPING THE COST\nOF THE PEN A MODEST AMOUNT EACH YEAR TO DOING IT AS FAST AS THEY\nPOSSIBLY COULD. I DON'T THINK THEY WERE DOING IT\nFOR ANY OTHER REASONS THAN SIMPLY TO MAKE MORE MONEY RIGHT\nAFTER A BONUS STRUCTURE WENT IN THAT WOULD HAVE REWARDED THAT\nFOR THE BIG EXECUTIVES. >> JUST VERY QUICKLY, LET'S\nDESCRIBE THE WELLS FARGO COMPENSATION STRUCTURES AS WELL,\nAND I THINK THIS ONE IS PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC,\nBECAUSE THIS IS A STRUCTURE THAT WAS IN PLACE FOR OVER FIVE\nYEARS, AND PEOPLE WERE GETTING BIG BONUSES AND THE COMPANY\nALREADY ADMITTED THEY WERE FIRING 5,000 PEOPLE OVER THE\nFIVE YEARS WHICH SHOULD HAVE SET UP SIGNALS THERE WAS SOMETHING\nWRONG. >> AND THEN YOU GET THE BIG\nBONUSES FOR THE PEOPLE -- THE WOMAN WHO WAS RUNNING THE RETAIL\nDIVISION. YOU CAN ALWAYS SMELL THAT\nTHERE'S SOMETHING WRONG. THEY SHOULD HAVE SMELLED THERE\nWAS SOMETHING WRONG THERE, JUST LIKE EPIPEN AND MYLAN SHOULD\nHAVE SMELLED SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH THEIR DOING, AND JACKING UP\nSOMETHING KIDS NEED AND SHOULD HAVE IN THEIR NAP SACKS, AND\nWHEN YOU ARE DOING THINGS LIKE THAT, I WONDER, HOW DO YOU GO TO\nSLEEP THAT WELL AT NIGHT? >> WALTER IT'S HARD TO PLAY\nDEVIL'S ADVOCATE IN THIS SITUATION, BUT LET ME TRY IF YOU\nJUST INDULGE ME. ON THE EPIPEN PIECE IS THERE\nANYTHING TO BE SAID ABOUT THE REGULATORY COMPONENT AROUND\nCOMPETITION, AROUND THE FACT THERE WAS NOT COMPETITION FOR\nTHIS DEVICE THAT WOULD HAVE PERHAPS KEPT THE PRICE OF IT\nDOWN? ON THE WELLS FARGO PIECE IT'S\nMUCH HARDER TO ARGUE, BY THE WAY, AND AGAIN, IS THERE AN\nARGUMENT TO BE MADE THAT ULTIMATELY EMPLOYEES HAVE TO BE\nETHICAL?

SO ANYTHING IN WHICH YOU TRY TO\nUNDERMINE COMPETITION AND THEN PEOPLE MAKE USE OF THAT FACT TO\nREAP PROFITS THEY HAD NOT EARNED AND WOULD NOT HAVE IN A\nCOMPETITIVE MARKET UNDERMINES OUR ENTIRE SYSTEM OF THE\nMARKETPLACE. >> SO WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE\nADVISED HEATHER BRESCH IF THEY WERE THINKING ABOUT RAISING THE\nPRICE FOR EPIPEN AS THEY LOOKED AT THE MARKET?\nWHAT SHOULD HAVE CONVERSATION HAVE BEEN?\n>> LET'S THINK OF THE MANY STAKEHOLDERS AND NOT JUST THE\nSHORT TERM, BUT THE INTEREST OF THE QUARTER BUT THE LONG-TERM\nFOR THE COMPANY, AND ARE WE GOING TO END UP IN A BETTER\nREGULATORY ENVIRONMENT BASED ON THINGS WE DO?\nSECONDLY, LET'S LOOK AT OUR CUSTOMERS.\nYOU GO BACK TO STEVE JOBS AND HE DID A LOT OF THINGS AT APPLE AND\nHE SAID WHY ARE WE DOING THAT AND PUTTING THAT IN, AND HE SAID\nI AM DOING IT FOR THE CUSTOMER AND YOU LOOK IF THE CLIENTS AND\nCUSTOMERS TRUST YOU, AND STEVE JOBS SAID YOU WILL END UP MAKING\nMORE AND BEING A MORE VALUABLE COMPANY.\nTELL ME MYLAN IS A MORE VALUABLE COMPANY BECAUSE OF WHAT IT DID?\nOF COURSE NOT, AND NOT A MORE ETHICAL COMPANY FOR WHAT THEY\nDID. >> WHILE YOU ARE HERE I WANT TO\nTALK ABOUT THE CYBER SUMMIT COMING UP.\n>> WE WILL HAVE ANDREW THERE, AND BECKY AND JOE.\n>> ANDREW WILL INTERVIEW JOHN  AND I TALKED TO ADMIRAL ROGERS\nAND HE RUNS A CYBER AD AND HE WILL BE UP THERE.\nIT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT TIME FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR, THE BANKS\nAND THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WERE DOING IT AT M.I.T., AND WE\nARE DOING IT WHERE SOME OF THE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO REARCHITECT\nPARTS OF THE INTERNET, AND WE REALLY HAVE TO GET TO HOW CAN WE\nMAKE AN INTERNET THAT IS MORE VERIFIED AND MORE SECURE AND\nMORE TRUSTWORTHY WHEN WE ARE SEEING EVERYTHING FROM OUR BANKS\nTO OUR ELECTION INFRASTRUCTURE BEING THREATENED BY THIS SORT OF\nCORROSION OF THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE INTERNET.\n>> WALTER, WE HAVE TO GO.

AMBASSADOR FOR THE U.S. POINTED OUT, IS FAIRLY\nRIDICULOUS, BUT THIS ENTIRE EPISODE IS SORT OF BROUGHT TO\nBEAR THE ISSUES THAT THE UNITED STATES AND RUSSIAN SYRIAN REGIME\nHAVE, WHICH IS THE U.S. AND RUSSIA WERE TRYING TO INTRODUCE\nA CEASE-FIRE WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE THREE GROUPS TO TARGET ISIS\nAND AL-NUSRA IN SYRIA, BUT INSTEAD OF USHERING IN THIS\nJOINT ATMOSPHERE OF COOPERATION, IT IS BREAKING DOWN.\nWE'RE SEEING VIOLENCE POPPING UP IN NOT ONLY ALEPPO, WHERE THERE\nWERE SYRIAN AIR STRIKES AGAINST REBELS THERE, BUT A SYRIAN PLANE\nWAS BROUGHT DOWN, SO THIS ENTIRE THING, SHANNON, SEEMS TO BE\nUNRAVELING BEFORE OUR VERY EYES. >> CONN OR POWELL LIVE THERE IN\nTHE MIDDLE EAST, THANK YOU SO",

WE ALSO KNOW THAT THEY HAD\nRAIDED FOR SEARCHED THE HOME IN ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY OVERNIGHT.\nTHIS SEEMS TO BE CENTERED AROUND ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY RIGHT NOW.\nTHE REASON THEY'RE LOOKING FOR THIS INDIVIDUAL IS BECAUSE THEY\nBELIEVE, NOW THEY'RE CAUTIONING US, THEY BELIEVE HE IS THE MAN\nON THE VIDEO THAT WE HAVE BEEN DESCRIBING SINCE YESTERDAY IN\nCHELSEA, SEEN AROUND THE AREA WHERE THE EXPLOSION OCCURS, AND\nALSO SEEN AGAIN ON 27th STREET WITH THIS DUFFEL BAG WHERE THEY\nEVENTUALLY FOUND THE PRESSURE COOKER.\n>> WE HAVE BEEN WONDERING WHAT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS GUY IS.\nTHAT WOULD MAKE SENSE IF HE WAS THE ONE ON THE SURVEILLANCE\nVIDEO. ISIS NOT CLAIMING\nRESPONSIBILITY. HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THAT TO YOU?\n>> DEAFENING SILENCE FROM ISIS ON THIS ONE.\nSO FAR. AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE\nSUSPECT, HE WAS BORN IN AFGHANISTAN, CAME TO THE UNITED\nSTATES. IF THERE IS, INDEED, A OVERSEAS\nTERROR CONNECTION WE DO NOT KNOW THAT AT THIS POINT BOUGHT\nGOVERNOR CUOMO AT LEAST RAISED THE POSSIBILITY THIS MORNING.\nINVESTIGATORS WILL LOOK AT GROUPS LIKE THE PAKISTAN TALIBAN\nLIKE AL QAEDA. THE PAKISTANI TALIBAN WERE A\nGROUP THAT DIRECTED THE TIMES SQUARE ATTACK ATTEMPTED ATTACK\nIN MAY OF 2010. THIS MAY HAVE -- THIS MAY HAVE\nNO ISIS CONNECTION WHATSOEVER. BUT YET WE'VE YET TO HEAR ANY\nCLAIM FROM ANY OVERSEAS GROUP. AND INVESTIGATORS DON'T KNOW IF\nTHIS HAS A FOREIGN CONNECTION YET.\n>> FAISAL SHAZ ADD WAS A BIG WAKE-UP CALL.\nHE HAD A LEGITIMATE LIFE HERE AND TO THE SURPRISE OF EVERYBODY\nIN THAT MAN'S LIFE, INCLUDING HIS OWN FAMILY, HE WAS JUST\nWAITING TO BE ACTIVATED ALL ALONG.\nTOM FUENTES THAT TAX US TO THE CONCERN ABOUT HOW DOES IT GROW\nOUT FROM THIS MAN, THERE WAS REPORTING EARLY ON FROM\nAUTHORITIES WHEN THEY STOPPED THAT CAR ON THE VERRAZANO,\nTHERE'S A GROUP, THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A CELL IN ELIZABETH, NEW\nJERSEY. HOW DO THEY LOOK AT THAT TYPE OF\nINVESTIGATION? >> WELL IN THE FIRST PLACE,\nCHRIS, THEY'LL BE LOOKING AT WHATEVER COMMUNICATION DEVICES\nHE HAD. SO HIS CELL -- OR HAS, STILL\nHAS, CELL PHONES THAT HE MAY HAVE USED.\nIF THEY BELIEVE THAT THE DUMPSTER BOMB ON 23rd STREET,\nTHE FIRST BOMB EXPLODED IN NEW YORK, WAS DETONATED BY A CELL\nPHONE CALL, THEN THAT A CELL PHONE WENT THROUGH THE CHELSEA\nPHONE TOWERS, AT THAT TIME WHEN THAT BOMB WAS DETONATED.\nTHERE MAY HAVE BEEN ANOTHER ATTEMPT USING THAT PHONE TO\nDETONATE THE SECOND DEVICE ON 27th STREET AND AGAIN THE TWO\nINDIVIDUALS THAT REMOVED THAT PRESSURE COOKER FROM THE DUFFEL\nBAG MAY HAVE DISTURBED THE WIRING WHICH MAY HAVE CAUSED IT\nTO NOT DETONATE. THAT MAY HAVE BEEN DISABLED\nACCIDENTALLY BY THOSE GUYS. AND THAT'S WHY IT DIDN'T\nDETONATE. BUT THEY WOULD HAVE CELL PHONE\nCONNECTIONS TRYING TO DETONATE IT.\nSO THAT'S ONE ASPECT OF IT. AND THEN LOOKING AT DOES HE HAVE\nSOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS? WHO WAS HE IN COMMUNICATION WITH\nAND HOW? OR IS HE USING DARK APPS WHICH\nTHE FBI IS NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO PENETRATE AND IT'S MUCH MORE\nDIFFICULT FOR THE INVESTIGATION. THEN YOU'VE GOT ALL OF THE VIDEO\nCAMERAS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT AS SHIMON MENTIONED THAT HAVE\nHELPED IDENTIFY HIM AS CARRYING THE DUFFEL BAG OR DRAGGING THE\nROLLING DUFFEL BAG AROUND. BUT YOU ALSO HAVE ALL OF THE\nSTREET CAMERAS, THE TOLL BRIDGE AND TUNNEL CAM RAS THAT WOULD\nSHOW THE VEHICLES COMING AND GOING FROM NEW JERSEY AND\nPOSSIBLY FROM ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY.\nSO THEY'D BE TRYING TO PIECE TOGETHER ALL OF THE HIGHWAY\nVIDEO THAT'S AVAILABLE TO THE POLICE AND TO THE FBI, SHOWING\nTHE MOVEMENT OF IN PARTICULAR THAT SUBARU VEHICLE OR OTHER\nVEHICLES THAT MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH HIM.\n>> RIGHT. THAT BRINGS US TO THE TRAFFIC\nSTOP THAT WAS MADE NEAR THE VERRAZANO BRIDGE.\nDO WE KNOW AND THERE WERE I THINK FIVE PEOPLE QUESTIONED.\n>> YES. >> DO WE KNOW WHAT THAT GUY IN\nTHE WANTED POSTER'S CONNECTION IS TO THOSE PEOPLE?\n>> NO WE DON'T.

AGAIN, EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW\nSEEMS TO BE CENTERED AROUND ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY WHERE THE\nFBI IS CONDUCTING ITS SEARCH. PERHAPS MAYBE THIS GUY LIVED\nTHERE OR THEY THOUGHT HE WAS THERE AND THEY WENT IN AND HE\nWASN'T THERE SO THIS NOW HAS STARTED THIS MANHUNT.\n>> THIS IS THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL ATTACK IN NEW YORK CITY SINCE\nSEPTEMBER 11th. WE HEARD THAT FROM OUTGOING\nCOMMISSIONER BILL BRATTON. YOU KNOW IT'S AN INTERESTING\nREMINDER. TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY ON THE\nJOB FOR EE NEIL, THE NEW COMMISSIONER OF THE NEW YORK\nPOLICE DEPARTMENT. WHAT A DAY TO START YOUR JOB.\nSHOULD THIS BE SEEN AS A FAILURE IF THERE WAS AN OPERATION OF\nMORE THAN ONE INDIVIDUAL GOING ON MULTIPLE DEVICES LEFT IN\nMULTIPLE AREAS, AND THEY WERE NEVER EVEN ON THE RADAR, SHOULD\nTHAT BE A CONCERN? >> WELL WE'LL HAVE TO SEE HOW\nTHINGS SHAKE OUT. BUT CLEARLY FROM THE NYPD FBI\nPOINT OF VIEW THEY VIEW ANY ATTACK THAT COULD GET THROUGH AS\nA FAILURE TO SOME AGREE. THEY DON'T WANT ANY ATTACKS TO\nGET THROUGH. BUT WE'LL SEE WHETHER THERE WERE\nSORT OF ANY MISSED WARNING SIENZ.\nBUT THE TESTMENT THAT THE EFFORTS OF THE FBI AND NYPD OVER\nTHE YEARS THAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN OTHER ATTACKS AS THERE HAVE BEEN\nPLENTY OF PLOTS CHRIS. >> TOM, PAUL, SHIMON, THANK YOU\nVERY MUCH.",

SUSPECT RIGHT NOW, THE IMAGE HAS\nJUST BEEN RELEASED BY THE FBI. 28-YEAR-OLD AHMED KHAN.\nTHERE'S HIS PICTURE RIGHT THERE. >> FIRST OF ALL, I THINK WE ARE\nSO LUCKY THAT NO ONE WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED.\nIT'S UNBELIEVABLE, WITH THE STABBINGS, THE BOMBINGS.\nIT'S UNBELIEVABLE. [ MULTIPLE PEOPLE SPEAKING ]\n>> I THINK THE PEOPLE THAT WERE INJURED HERE IN NEW YORK CITY\nHERE, WE'RE LUCKY. THIS PROBLEM, WHEN WE TALK\nABOUT -- IT'S NOT OVER THERE ANY LONGER.\nTHIS PROBLEM IS RIGHT HERE. SO THIS RISE OF RADICAL ISLAMISM\nAND I REALLY -- I REALLY DO APPRECIATE GOVERNOR CUOMO'S\nCANDIDNESS. I SAW HIS INTERVIEW YESTERDAY\nWHEN I WAS UP HERE. I LISTENED TO YOUR INTERVIEW\nWITH DONALD TRUMP. I MEAN, THIS IS A VERY, VERY\nSERIOUS NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE AND NATIONAL SECURITY IS NOT\nJUST A FOREIGN POLICY AND HOW WE DEAL WITH THE THREATS AND\nCHALLENGES THAT WE FACE OVERSEAS, BUT IT'S NATIONAL\nSECURITY IS ALSO HOMELAND SECURITY AND THESE THINGS ARE\nSO -- SO LINKED TOGETHER, THESE DAYS, AND WE HAVE TO BE MUCH\nMORE SERIOUS ABOUT WHAT IT IS THAT WE'RE FACING, AND I THINK\nTHAT THE COMPONENT OF THE INTERVIEW THAT YOU DID WITH\nDONALD TRUMP ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, REFUGEE FLOW INTO\nTHIS COUNTRY, I MEAN, WHAT IS IT THAT IS GOING ON?\nTHAT'S THE BIG QUESTION, THAT'S GOING ON INSIDE OF THIS --\nINSIDE OF THIS COMMUNITY THAT IS INSPIRING THESE PEOPLE TO DO\nTHESE TYPES OF THGSES, AND -- THINGS.\nAND WHEN WE SAY WE'RE WINNING OVER THERE AND IT'S BRINGING THE\nPROBLEM OVER HERE, THAT MEANS WE'RE NOT WINNING.\nWE'RE NOT WINNING. THERE'S ONE THING I DISAGREE\nWITH EVERYBODY THAT I'VE HEARD TALKING THIS MORNING OR\nCERTAINLY WHAT -- SOMETHING THAT GOVERNOR CUOMO JUST SAID.\nWE'RE NOT WINNING. WE'RE NOT WINNING.\nAND WE HAVE TO FACE THE FACT THAT IN ORDER TO DEFEAT THIS\nENEMY, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE OTHER MEASURES AND SOME OF\nTHOSE MEASURES INCLUDE A WHOLE RANGE OF ACTIVITIES, WHETHER\nIT'S MILITARY, WHETHER IT'S GOING AFTER THEIR -- I MEAN,\nTHEY HAVE SOMETHING CALLED THE ISLAMIC CYBER ARMY.\nI SENT YOU SOMETHING THAT, YOU KNOW, AS YOUR TIME PERMITS,\nBRIAN TO READ, LESSONS LEARNED FROM NICE, FRANCE.\nIT'S STUNG -- STUNNING. IN THAT LESSONS LEARN THAT THEY\nPUT OUT TO THEIR GROUP OF PEOPLE, IT TALKS ABOUT EXACTLY\nWHAT WE JUST SAW. >> YOU MEAN THEY HAVE WHAT THEY\nLEARNED -- >> THE ENEMY CONSTANTLY LEARNS\nAND THEN THEY PUT OUT LESSONS LEARN.\nTHEY PUBLISH THE LESSONS LEARNED.\nTHEY HAVE A NEW MAGAZINE THAT'S PUBLISHED IN ABOUT EIGHT\nDIFFERENT LANGUAGES, ENGLISH, RUSSIAN, YUGHIR, PASHTO,\nFREMPLE -- FRENCH, ARABIC. >> THINK ABOUT MINNESOTA, WHAT\nHAPPENED IN THE MALL. YOU HAVE A GUY WHO WAS A REFUGEE\nHERE FROM SOMALIA, 15 YEARS AGO. THEN THERE WERE NO OFFICERS\nTHERE IN THE MALL PROTECTING THE INDIVIDUALS.\nTHIS WAS A GUY WHO HAD -- HE WAS OFF DUTY AND HE HAD A GUN ON HIM\nAND HE WAS THE ONE WHO KILLED THE GUY WITH THE KNIFE.\nTHAT WAS THE ONLY MAN WHO DIED IN THAT SITUATION.\nBUT WE HAVE ALL THESE RULES NOW. ALL THESE PEOPLE SPEAKING OUT\nAGAINST GUN CONTROL, IF IT WEREN'T FOR THIS GUY WITH A GUN,\nTHIS GUY WOULD STILL BE ON THE LOOSE.\n>> AND THE METAPHOR, LOOK AT THE FOUR OF US, WE'RE ON THE EDGE OF\nTHE SEATS OF THIS COUCH AND AMERICA IS ON THE EDGE OF ITS\nSEAT -- EDGE OF SEATS OF THEIR WITS, BECAUSE PEOPLE GETTING ON\nTRAINS, GOING TO THE MALL, LIKE I SAID YESTERDAY, THESE GUYS\nPUBLISHED A WEEK AGO, GO ATTACK CHILDREN.\nTHIS IS NOT A JV TEAM. THIS IS NOT AN ENEMY THAT WE CAN\nTAKE -- WE MUST TAKE THIS ENEMY VERY, VERY SERIOUSLY, AND WE\nHAVE TO REACH OUT TO THE MUSLIM WORLD.\nWE MUST REACH OUT TO THE MUSLIM WORLD IN A MUCH DIFFERENT WAY.\nAND I WILL TELL YOU A LOT OF LEADERS IN THE MUSLIM WORLD,\nTHEY ARE SCARED. THEY ARE AFRAID AND THEY KNOW\nTHAT THEY HAVE A PROBLEM. >> GENERAL, WE'VE GOT -- FOR\nFOLKS WHO ARE TUNING IN, THE FBI HAS RELEASED AN IMAGE OF A\n28-YEAR-OLD SUSPECT WHO IS WANTED IN CONNECTION.\nIT IS ON THE LEFT SIDE OF YOUR SCREEN.\nHIS NAME IS AHMAD KHAN RAMAHI. HE DOES RELATE TO THE ADDRESS ON\nTHE RIGHT SIDE OF THE HOME. IT'S LINK TO A PERSON WITH A\nSIMILAR NAME. IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S THE GUY THEY\nARE LOOKING FOR. THEY HAVE GONE TO HIS HOUSE --\n>> DO WE KNOW WHICH BOMBING HE'S CONNECTED TO?\n>> WE DON'T. THEY CAN BE THE SAME.\n>> SO GENERAL, I'M VERY CURIOUS TO SEE -- IS WE REMEMBER WHAT\nHAPPENED UNTIL TEXAS, WHEN THOSE GUYS SHOWED UP TO TAKE DOWN THE\nDRAW MOHAMMED SITUATION. THEY LEAVE FROM PHOENIX AND THEY\nGET GUNNED DOWN BY SECURITY. I'M SCURS IF HE'S ON ANYBODY'S\nRADAR. I'M CURIOUS IF WE WERE TRACKING\nHIM TO BEGIN WITH AND TRYING TO FIND OUT -- WERE WE JUST LUCKY\n7 1/2 YEARS AGO AND HAVE WE CHANGED OUR TACTICS NOW BECAUSE\nTHE NUMBER OF TERROR ATTACKS ARE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP UP\nWITH. >> I THINK FOR THE LAW\nENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY IN OUR COUNTRY, FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL\nLEVEL, THEY HAVE TO BE ALLOWED TO DO THE JOB THAT THEY ARE\nVERY, VERY CAPABLE OF DOING, AND WHEN THEIR HANDS ARE TIED BY\nPOLITICAL CORRECTNESS AND ALL THIS MADNESS THAT WE TALK ABOUT,\nYOU KNOW, IT'S TRESHL. IT'S TRESHL.\nAND YOU TELL YOUR LAW FIRM COMMUNITY THAT YOU HAVE MY\nFULL -- LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY THAT YOU HAVE MY FULL\nSUPPORT. >> GENERAL FLYNN, THANK YOU SO\nMUCH. >> A LOT GOING ON.\nPICTURE UP OF THE SUSPECT. 28RDS -- 28 YEARS OLD.\nWE HAVE MORE IN JUST A MOMENT.

IT'S BASICALLY A WORKING CLASS,\nLOWER MIDDLE CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD HERE IN ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY,\nJUST SOUTH OF NEW YORK CITY. YOU GET A SENSE OF STREETS.\nWUF GOT A BODEGA AND APARTMENTS AND HOUSES, BEAUTY SALONS.\nRESIDENTS ARE GOING TO BE FACING A LOT OF QUESTIONS IN TERMS OF\nWHO DID YOU KNOW, WHAT DID YOU SEE, WHAT DID YOU SEE IT.\nAS PEOPLE WAKE UP THIS MORNING, WE HAVE A LOT MORE FOLKS TO ASK.\nAS WE HAVE THE PICTURE FROM THE FBI, IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO\nSEE IF THEY RECOGNIZE THIS GUY AS SOMEBODY THEY EVER SAW.\n>> WE SHOULD POINT OUT AS WE LOOK AT THE IMAGE OF THE FBI AND\nTHAT'S THE MUGSHOT, THE WANTED POSTER.\n>> THE MAN THAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR.\n>> AHMAD KHAN RAHAMI. I'VE HAD A SMART PHONE FOR MANY,\nMANY YEARS, I HAVE NEVER GOTTEN ONE OF THESE FROM THE FBI.\nIT WENT OFF FIVE MINUTES AGO. EVERYBODY IN THE STUDIO GOT THE\nSAME EMERGENCY ALERT. IT SAYS THAT THIS GUY IS ARMED\nAND DANGEROUS, COULD BE. IT SAYS HE'S 5' 6\", ABOUT 2\nHUNDRED POUNDS. I WONDER WHY THEY WOULD PUT OUT\nAN EMERGENCY ALERT AT 5 MINUTES UNTIL 8:00 IN THE MORNING.\n>> HE'S SO DANGEROUS, AND YOU HAVE TO HAND IT TO OUR LAW\nENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. THIS ALL COULD BE A DIFFERENT\nSTORY THIS MORNING. OVER THE WEEKEND WE HAD TWO\nTHINGS GOING ON IN NEW YORK. WE HAD TWO THINGS GOING ON IN\nNEW JERSEY, AND NOW OFFICERS ARE ALREADY RAIDING THIS GUY'S\nAPARTMENT. THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHO HE IS AND\nTHEY ARE SHOWING US HIS PICTURE. >> LAST NIGHT, THEY WERE\nBRINGING US ALL THE LATEST NEWS. BRET JOINS US NOW GETTING SET\nFOR SPECIAL REPORT. BRET, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S\nUNFOLDING NOW. WE DO KNOW KNOW -- NOT KNOW HOW\nTHIS ENDS. >> GOOD MORNING.\nWE'RE FOLLOWING IT CLOSELY OBVIOUSLY AND THE FBI PUTTING\nOUT THAT ALERT FOR BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR THIS MAN IS\nSIGNIFICANT. ALSO HE IS A U.S. NATURALIZED\nCITIZEN FROM AFGHANISTAN. 28 YEARS OLD.\nAND MAY BE WORKING WITH OTHERS. WE HAVE SOME SOURCES SAYING THAT\nTHERE WERE VIDEOTAPES SHOWING OTHER PEOPLE IN AND AROUND\nTHERE, SO I THINK THAT THIS INVESTIGATION IS GOING TO MOVE\nQUICKLY AND WE'LL LEARN MORE THROUGHOUT THE DAY.\nTHE TIE TO NEW JERSEY, WHETHER IT WAS SIMILAR OR NOT, AND\nOBVIOUSLY ALL OF THE CONNECTIONS ALL HAPPENING IN THE SAME\nWEEKEND AS THE MINNESOTA STABBING, I THINK PEOPLE SAY,\nEXPERTS LOOK AT THIS AND SAY IT'S NOT ALL CONNECTED YET, BUT\nSOMETIMES THESE EVENTS TRIGGER OTHER EVENTS AROUND THE COUNTRY.\n>> BRET, BRIAN EARLIER IN THE SHOW WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW\nIMPORTANT IT IS TO INTERVIEW THESE INDIVIDUALS AND ASK THEM\nQUESTIONS AND WE WERE TOLD THAT THERE WERE FIVE MEN FROM\nAFGHANISTAN THAT WERE INTERVIEWED, THAT WERE TAKEN IN.\nTHEY WERE INTERVIEWED. THEY WEREN'T SUSPECTS, AND THEY\nWERE ASKING THEM QUESTIONS. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY SAID TO\nTHE OFFICERS, WHETHER OR NOT THEY TOLD THE FBI ABOUT THIS GUY\nOR IF THIS GUY WAS ONE OF THOSE FIVE.\nACTUALLY, WE KNOW HE'S NOT ONE OF FIVE.\nTHOSE FIVE ARE IN CUSTODY AND NOW WE'RE LOOKING FOR HIM.\nBUT IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO ASK QUESTIONS AND FOR PEOPLE TO STEP\nFORWARD AND COME OUT WITH ANY INFORMATION THEY KNOW ABOUT THIS\nINDIVIDUAL. >> WE DON'T INTERROGATE.\n>> IF YOU SEE IT, LOOKS SUSPICIOUS, CALL IT IN.\nTHAT'S PART OF THE DEAL. THE NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT\nIS ONE OF THE BEST IN THE COUNTRY TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW UP\nON THIS ALONG WITH THE FBI. THEY ARE WELL-POSITIONED, AND I\nBET YOU ARE GOING TO SEE MUCH MORE SECURITY PRESENCE ON THE\nSTREETS WITH THE U.N.GA IN TOWN. >> THERE WERE TWO PRESSURE\nCOOKER BOMBS. ONE EXPLODED ON 23rd STREET IN\nNEW YORK CITY, THE ONE ON 27th STREET DID NOT.\nAPPARENTLY, ACCORDING TO SOME OF THE LOCAL NEWS OUTLETS HERE IN\nNEW YORK, BRET, APPARENTLY THERE'S A HANDWRITTEN LETTER\nNEAR THE UNEXPLODED ONE, A PORTION OF IT WAS WRITTEN IN\nARABIC, WHICH MAKES YOU WONDER ALL SORTS OF THINGS.\nWE HAVE THE GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK STATE ON THE PROGRAM EARLIER AND\nASKED HIM ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF AN INTERNATIONAL CONNECTION\nAND THIS IS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY. >> TODAY, I BELIEVE, WE'RE GOING\nTO FIND OUT THAT IT WAS TARGETED BY A FOREIGN BODY, BUT YESTERDAY\nI SAID IT WAS A TERRORIST ACT. I BELIEVE IT WAS A TERRORIST\nACT. TODAY, I BELIEVE THAT WE'RE\nGOING TO FIND OUT THAT IT WAS INFLUENCED BY FOREIGN FORCES.\n>> INFLUENCED BY FOREIGN FORCES. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?\nYOU KNOW A LOT OF POLITICIANS. WHAT'S THAT MEAN?\n>> IT'S TIPTOEING THROUGH THE SEMANTICS OF WHAT IS TERRORISM,\nAND I THINK THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS\nTAPPED INTO, IS THE TALKING ABOUT THESE ACTS THAT SEEM\nCUT-AND-DRY AND SOMETIMES POLITICIANS BEING VERY HESITANT,\nESPECIALLY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND WHAT WE'VE\nSEEN SO FAR FROM HILLARY CLINTON, AND IT TAKES THEM A\nWHILE TO GET TO TERRORISM. I THINK THAT THE GOVERNOR GOT\nTHERE VERY QUICKLY, AND NOW HE'S SAYING THAT THERE MAY BE A\nBROADER, A BIGGER, KIND OF DIRECTIVE FROM SOME GROUP, ISIS,\nAL QAEDA, SOMEBODY, IN THIS CASE, AND IF THAT IS THE CASE,\nIT TAKES IT TO A DIFFERENT LEVEL THAN HOME GROWN AND INSPIRED\nISIS ATTACK. >> VERY TRUE. COUPLE STATS.\nTHERE HAVE BEEN 100,000 I UNDERSTAND SOMALIS IN OUR\nCOUNTRY SINCE 2011 AND ONE OUT OF FIVE HAVE BEEN SETTLED IN THE\nNEW YORK AREA. BY DEFINITION, WE DO NOT HAVE A\nPROPER SCREENING PROCESS TO GET THEM HERE.\nHOWEVER, DONALD TRUMP EARLIER WAS WITH US AND WE WERE TALKING\nABOUT THE DIFFERENT RESPONSE. LIKE IT OR NOT, POLITICS PLAYS A\nROLE HERE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO SEE IF THEIR NEXT\nPRESIDENT, HOW THEIR NEXT PRESIDENT WOULD HANDLE A TERROR\nATTACK. HERE'S DONALD TRUMP ON WHAT HE\nSAW FROM HILLARY. >> EVEN YOU ARE NOT GOING TO PUT\nTROOPS ON THE GROUND. YOU SHOULD NEVER SAY IT.\nSHE'S SAYING THAT BECAUSE SHE'S DESPERATE FOR VOTES.\nALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT HER POLL NUMBERS.\nIF YOU WANT WEAKNESS, SHE'S WEAK.\nI WATCHED HER IN THE AIRPLANE OVER THE WEEKEND TALKING AND I\nCOULDN'T -- I WOULD HATE TO SEE FOUR MORE -- FORGETTING ABOUT\nME, I WOULD HATE TO SEE FOUR MORE YEARS OF THOSE KIND OF\nANSWERS. >> SO THEY ARE POSTURING, RIGHT,\nBRET? >> YEAH.\nLISTEN, HE'S BOLD. IT'S WORKED FOR HIM THROUGHOUT\nTHE PRIMARY AND THE ELECTION SO FAR, SAYING IT LIKE IT IS, AND\nHILLARY WAS TRYING TO TONE THINGS THINGS DOWN, IT SEEMED,\nON THAT PLANE, TALKING TO REPORTERS AND BEING VERY, VERY\nMEASURED IN THOSE FIRST REMARKS. I DO THINK THAT SHE HAD TO CLEAN\nUP WHEN SHE SAID NO MORE U.S. TROOPS.\nTHE NEXT DAY, IF YOU REMEMBER, SHE HAD A NEWS CONFERENCE IN\nWHICH SHE SAID I'M FOR SPECIAL FORCES AND TRAINERS AND\nFACILITATORS, BUT JUST NOT MAJOR GROUND FORCES.\nTHAT WAS FROM THAT COMMANDER IN CHIEF FORUM.\nSO THIS WILL BE AN ISSUE, BRIAN, IN THE DEBATE ONE WEEK FROM NOW.\n>> ABSOLUTELY. >> WE HAD THE GOVERNOR ON\nEARLIER, BRET, AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN'T MAKE\nIT POLITICAL. HE CALLED IT TERRORISM RIGHT OUT\nOF THE GATE. THE MAYOR REFUSED TO CALL IT\nTERRORISM AND YOU HAVE TIM KAINE AND HILLARY CLINTON SAYING ISIS\nSTRIKES IN OUR CITIES MEANS WE'RE WINNING ABROAD.\n>> YEAH. IT'S A TOUGH ARGUMENT TO MAKE.\nIT MAY BE ACCURATE THAT THEY ARE BEING FORCED OUT OF CERTAIN\nAREAS OVERSEAS, BUT IT'S TOUGH FOR PEOPLE AT HOME, HOW THEY\nFEEL ABOUT THE THREAT OF TERRORISM.\nTHAT'S WHERE IT STACKS. IT IS VERY HIGH UP THERE.\nTERRORISM AND NATIONAL SECURITY, AND RIGHT NOW AS YOU MENTIONED,\nIT'S TIED BETWEEN THE TWO CANDIDATES.\nTHERE'S POLITICS IN EVERYTHING, BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS\nTHAT THEY GET THESE GUYS AND PROTECT THE STREETS OF NEW YORK\nAND NEW JERSEY. >> ABSOLUTELY.\nAND IT IS CURIOUS THAT THEY WOULD PUT OUT THE -- THE FBI\nWOULD PUT OUT THIS ALERT, WENT OFF ON OUR PHONES HERE IN THE\nSTUDIO.
