HE'S BEEN PUSHING THE STORY FOR\nYEARS AND ENDS IT IN 27 SECONDS. HE WAS MARRIED TO THIS THEORY,\nAND THEN IT'S LAKE A QUICKIE VEGAS DIVORCE LIKE, HEY, 27\nSECOND, WE'RE DONE, LET'S MOVE ON.\nAND IT'S SUCH AN ABOUTFACE. WHAT I THINK WOULD BE GREAT IS\nIF OBAMA DID EXACTLY THE SAME AND COMES ON AND SAYS, WAIT A\nSECOND, I WAS BORN IN KENYA. YOU KNOW, I GOT FOUR MONTHS\nLEFT, I WAS BORN IN KENYA WOULD BE HILARIOUS.\nI DON'T THINK HE WILL DO THAT. I DO THINK THAT --\n>> NO. >> HE REALLY DEBATED THIS --\n>> I DO THINK YOU HAVE TO BE -- THESE ARE COMPATIBLE STORIES.\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN DID HAVE A ROLE IN THIS.\nBUT YOU CAN'T EXCUSE DONALD FOR PUSHING THIS FOR A LONG TIME\nWITH VERY EXPLICIT AND VERY -- AND VERY COMPLETE TWEETS ABOUT\nHIM NOT BEING BORN IN THE UNITED STATES.\n>> YOU CAN'T EXCUSE DONALD TRUMP, BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S A\nCOINCIDENCE THAT THIS IS THE NARRATIVE THAT SHE'S USING AND\nLIBERALS ARE POUNCING ON.

I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHY THIS IS\nGOOD POLITICS FOR DONALD TRUMP AND WAS WELL PLAYED BY HIM.\n-- HIS BASE IS NOT GOING TO BAND HIM.\nTHE BASE THAT STILL BUYS INTO THE FACT THAT OBAMA WAS BORN\nELSEWHERE, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO LEAVE HIM FOR COMING OUT TODAY\nAND ACKNOWLEDGING THE TRUTH. BUT THIS IS WHERE IT'S GOOD FOR\nHIM. THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY\nNOW THAT ARE STILL TRYING TO DECIDE IS DONALD TRUMP A\nPRESIDENT OR A CRAZY CONSPIRACY THEORIST?\nAND FOR THOSE PEOPLE, THIS CAN KIND OF WORK AT HIS ADVANTAGE TO\nDISSIPATE SOME OF THAT BELIEF. NOW, ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON,\nTHOUGH, I HAD TO LAUGH WHEN SHE TALKED ABOUT HIM COMING FOR THE\nFIRST BLACK PRESIDENT. HILLARY CLINTON, YOU DID AND\nSAID EVERYTHING YOU POSSIBLY COULD TO MAKE SURE THAT BARACK\nOBAMA WOULD NOT BE AMERICA'S FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT, INCLUDING\nTHE FACT THAT HER SUPPORTERS -- IAN, YOU'RE RIGHT.\nTRUMP COULD PUT THIS TO BED AGAIN AND SAY YOU KNOW, HILLARY,\nMAYBE YOU DIDN'T SAY IT, BUT YOUR SUPPORTERS DID, YOUR\nVOLUNTEERS DID. THIS WAS NOT ORIGINATED\nCOMPLETELY BY ME. AND CALL HER OUT ON IT.\nI REMEMBER WHO HILLARY CLINTON SHOWED HERSELF TO BE IN 2007.\nAND I WILL NOT FORGET IT. PEOPLE WHO WANT TO SIT AND LOOK\nLIKE THEY HAVE AMNESIA NOW, THEY WILL DO SO AT THEIR OWN PERIL.\nSHE SHOWED EXACTLY WHO SHE WAS IN THE PRIMARY.\n>> THE CLIP WHERE SHE SAID \"AS FAR AS I KNOW,\" THAT'S LIKE\nSAYING I DON'T THINK HE MURDERED ANYONE, AS FAR AS I KNOW.\nTHAT'S NOT A GOOD -- >> SHE ALWAYS IT.\nTHAT'S WHO SHE WAS. FOR SOMEONE WHO WAS PAYING LIKE\nVERY -- I WAS LOOKING FOR WHO HER CORE WAS.\nI'VE HAD LONG SUSPICIONS AROUND HILLARY AND BILL CLINTON AND\nTHEIR TRUE NATURE OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BLACK\nCOMMUNITY. AND LIKE I SAID, SHE SHOWED ME\nEXACTLY WHAT SHE WAS DURING THAT PRIMARY.\n>> THAT'S INTERESTING. SO TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT, DO YOU\nTHINK ALSO IN TERMS OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES,\nSORTS OF A REMINDER THAT KIND OF THE -- THE DISPERSIONS THAT WERE\nCAST UPON PRESIDENT OBAMA THAT HER CAMP DIDN'T REALLY QUELL AT\nTHE TIME. >> THEY DIDN'T, KIMBERLY.\nTODAY TO THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS, MANY OF WHOSE MEMBERS I\nREMEMBER, BUT KIND OF RALLY AROUND HILLARY CLINTON AND BE\nPROTECTIONIST FOR HER ON THIS ISSUE IS ABSOLUTELY APPALLING TO\nME. YOU CANNOT ACT LIKE THIS WOMAN\nIS NOT DONE AND -- HAS NOT DONE AND SAID THINGS THAT SHE HAS IN\nREFERENCE TO THE PRESIDENT. IT'S IMPORTANT.\nI KNOW HOW MUCH SHE'S DEPENDED ON THE COALITION, THAT ALMIGHTY\nOBAMA COALITION TO SAVE THE DAY FOR HER.\nYOU'VE GOT TO BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT YOU'VE SAID AND DONE.\n>> THERE'S AN INTERESTING  THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN IS\nPRESIDENT OBAMA WHEN HE'S SENATOR RUNNING AGAINST SENATOR\nCLINTON SAID NASTY THINGS ABOUT HER.\nAND NOW IF YOU JUXTAPOSE WHAT HE SAID IN '07 AND '08 DURING THE\nCAMPAIGN TO WHAT HE'S SAYING NOW, IT'S VASTLY DIFFERENT.\nAT ONE POINT HE SAID SHE'S -- ONE OF THE MOST DISHONEST\nPOLITICIANS AROUND. AND WENTA, LONG THAT VEIN.\nNOW HE'S SAYING VOTE FOR HER. IT --\n>> HE'S GOT TO SEE THAT, BUT COLIN POWELL TOLD US ALL WHAT\nTHE REAL DEAL IS. AND I LOVED THOSE EMAILS FOR\nTHAT. LOOK, AGAIN, THAT NASTINESS THAT\nWENT DOWN IN THAT PRIMARY DOESN'T GO AWAY JUST BECAUSE.\nPOLITICAL CONVENIENCE. >> TRUE.\nTHERE'S ANOTHER AS PECK, TOO, ESPECIALLY WHEN SHE IS --\nASPECTS, TOO, ESPECIALLY WHEN SHE'S SAYING I'M THE CANDIDATE\nFOR YOU, I'M THE CHAMPION OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS, OF MINORITY\nCOMMUNITIES NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE 2008, OBAMA'S CAMPAIGN\nMANAGER ACTUALLY ACCUSED THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN OF SHAMEFUL,\nOFFENSIVE FEAR MONGERING WITH CIRCULATING THE POST.\nTHE PHOTO THAT TRIED TO SMEAR OBAMA --\n>> THAT WAS PLUTH. >> APPEARED ON \"THE DRUDGE\nREPORT\" FIRST, THE WEBSITE, WITH OBAMA DRESSED AS HE WAS A SOMALI\nELDER. YOU COUPLE THESE THINGS TOGETHER\n-- >> THAT WAS THE PLAN.\nTHEY WANTED TO CAST HIM AS AN OTHER.\n>> HERE'S THE THINGS -- YOU KNOW WHAT'S INTERESTING, TOO, IS THAT\nHILLARY IS DOING EXACTLY WHAT SHE'S ACCUSING TRUMP OF DOING\nWITH DAVID DUKE. EVERYBODY SAYING -- TRUMP, WHY\nDON'T YOU CONDEMN THE PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT YOU FOR WHAT THEY\nBELIEVE IN, LIKE WHEN -- WHEN DAVID DUKE -- BUT THEN SHE\nSHOULD BE CONDEMNING HER SUPPORTERS, THE PEOPLE IN HER\nCAMPAIGN THAT PUSHED THE BIRTHER IDEA.\nAND SHE DIDN'T BECAUSE THE BIRTHER IDEA, THE BIRTHER\nCONSPIRACY -- >> SERVED HER.\n>> AND YOUR FATHER WAS SO GRACEFUL --\n>> I WAS GOING TO SAY, NONE OF THESE CANDIDATES' HANDS ARE\nCLEAN.

HE WAS BORN IN PANAMA IN AN AIR\nFORCE BASE BASE. >> MY DAD, TED CRUZ, NOBODY'S\nBORN IN AMERICA. >> THAT'S TRUE.\n>> HERE'S THE POINT -- IF YOU BRING IT UP IN TERMS OF THAT, IT\nHAS NOTHING TO DO WITH RACE, IT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH\nLOCATION OF BIRTH. LOOK, HE CAN SAY HE DIDN'T SAY\nOR DID, HE ALSO SUGGESTED THAT TED CRUZ, IS HE A VIABLE\nCANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH RACE.\n>> TED CRUZ ISN'T TECHNICALLY A MAN OF COLOR, THOUGH.\n>> CUBAN. >> YEAH, HE'S CUBAN.\nI DO THINK THERE IS SOMETHING TO --\n>> MY GOD -- >> IS HE NOT?\n>> YES. >> OKAY.\n>> I DIDN'T THINK OF THAT. HE HAS --\n>> I'M JUST SAYING THAT THE LENS OF OTHERNESS, PEOPLE DO LIKE\nTHAT. I'M SAYING.\n>> TRUMP WENT AFTER CUBA, BUT WHAT WAS IT ABOUT -- NOT A LOT\nOF EVANGELICALS COME FROM CUBA. THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.\n>> YEAH. CRUZ IS FROM CANADA.\n>> THE CRITICISM ABOUT CONSPIRACY THEORIES WHEN -- I\nHATE CONSPIRACY THEORIES, BUT TO GO AFTER TRUMP ABOUT THAT --\n>> NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE MISSING. >> I KNOW.\n>> IT'S SO MUCH FUN. >> I'M TRYING TO SAY THAT THE\nLEFT, THE LEFT STARTED THE ART, THE FINE ART OF CONSPIRACY\nTHEORIES.

THIS MORNING ENDED WITH A\n40-SECOND SOUND BITE AND TOUCHED OFF A DAY OF POLITICAL FALLOUT\nTHAT HAS NOT STOPPED YET. WELCOME TO THE KELLY FILE\nEVERYONE, I'M MEGYN KELLY. AFTER FIVE YEARS OF RAISING\nQUESTIONS ABOUT EXACTLY WHERE PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA MAY HAVE\nBEEN BORN, DONALD TRUMP YESTERDAY DECLARED HE WOULD\nFINALLY PUT THE ISSUE TO REST. FIRST HE ANNOUNCED A NEWS\nCONFERENCE, THEN HIS CAMPAIGN FOLLOWED UP WITH A WRITTEN\nSTATEMENT, TRUMP HIT THE EARLY NEWS SHOWS PROMISING A MAJOR\nANNOUNCEMENT. AND BY 10:00 A.M. THIS MORNING,\nALL OF THE NATION'S MAJOR MEDIA OUTLETS WERE BREATHLESSLY\nGATHERED AWAITING THE CANDIDATE'S COMMENTS.\nAT 11:03 A.M. AN HOUR AFTER THE EVENT WAS SUPPOSED TO BEGIN, OUT\nWALKED TRUMP, SURROUNDED BY A GROUP OF VETERANS WHO PROVEEDED\nTO TAKE THE MICROPHONE IN TERMS PRAISING MR. TRUMP'S COMMITMENT\nTO THE MILITARY. SOME 90 MINUTES AFTER THE START\nOF NONSTOP LIVE COVERAGE BY ALL OF THE CABLE NETS, WE FINALLY\nGOT TO HEAR MORE ABOUT WHAT IS KNOWN NOW AS THE BIRTHER ISSUE.\nWATCH. >> HILLARY CLINTON AND HER\nCAMPAIGN OF 2008 STARTED THE BIRTHER CONTROVERSY.\nI FINISHED IT. I FINISHED IT.\nYOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA WAS BORN\nIN THE UNITED STATES, PERIOD. NOW WE ALL WANT TO GET BACK TO\nMAKING AMERICA STRONG AND GREAT AGAIN.\nTHANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nTHANK YOU. THANK YOU.\n>> AS SHORT AS THIS WAS, THERE'S A LOT TO UNPACK FROM IT.\nINCLUDING REACTIONS FROM REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS AND THE\nWHITE HOUSE, ALONG WITH TRUMP'S HISTORY ON THIS ISSUE AND THAT\nOF MRS. CLINTON. AND WE HAVE A POWERFUL LINEUP\nFOR YOU THIS EVENING, INCLUDING GOVERNOR MIKE HUCKABEE, BILL\nBENNETT, MARK McKINNON AND MARK HALPRIN.\nBUT FIRST WE GO TO TRACE GALLAGHER IN THE WEST COAST\nNEWSROOM TO WALK US THROUGH HOW WE GOT TO THIS MOMENT.\nTRACE? >> FROM OUR RESEARCH IT APPEARS\nTHAT DONALD TRUMP FIRST DIPPED HIS TOE IN THE BIRTHER ISSUE IN\n2011 WHEN HE WAS CONSIDERING RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN 2012.\nHE TOLD CPAC QUOTE OUR CURRENT PRESIDENT CAME OUT OF NOWHERE.\nTHE PEOPLE WHO WENT TO SCHOOL WITH HIM, THEY NEVER SAW HIM.\nTHEY DON'T KNOW WHO HE IS. IT'S CRAZY.\nA MONTH LATER HE TOLD BILL O'REILLY THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA\nDOESN'T HAVE A BIRTH CERTIFICATE AND LATER TOLD NBC NEWS THAT HE\nWAS SENDING A TEAM OF INVESTIGATORS TO HAWAII TO\nINVESTIGATE. IN APRIL OF 2011 PRESIDENT OBAMA\nWHO HAD ALREADY RELEASED A SHORT FORM BIRTH CERTIFICATE IN 2008\nDECIDED TO RELEASE THE LONG FORM SAYING IT WAS TIME TO PUT THE\nISSUE TO REST. AND EVEN THOUGH THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN IS NOW TAKING CREDIT FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA RELEASING\nHIS LONG FORM IN 2011, DONALD TRUMP CONTINUED FOR YEARS TO\nCLAIM THAT OBAMA WAS NOT A U.S. CITIZEN.\nAS LATE AS THE SUMMER OF 2015 TRUMP SAID HE DIDN'T KNOW IF\nOBAMA WAS BORN IN THE U.S. THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN ALSO BLAMES\nHILLARY CLINTON FOR RAISING THE BIRTHER ISSUE IN THE FIRST PLACE\nDURING HER 2008 CAMPAIGN, REFERRING TO THIS INTERVIEW ON\n\"60 MINUTES\" WHEN ASKED IF SHE THOUGHT BARACK OBAMA WAS MUSLIM.\nWATCH. >> YOU SAID YOU TAKE SENATOR\nOBAMA AT HIS WORD THAT HE'S A MUSLIM.\n>> NO. >> YOU DON'T BELIEVE HE'S A\nMUSLIM? >> NO.\nTHERE IS NOTHING TO BASE THAT ON AS FAR AS I KNOW.\n>> EVEN THOUGH FACT CHECK ORGANIZATIONS SAY CLINTON DIDN'T\nSTART THE BIRTHER ISSUE, THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HER \"60\nMINUTES\" INTERVIEW FANNED THE FLAMES.\nAND HER SUNTERS IN 2008 DID PROPAGATE IT.\nTODAY HILLARY CLINTON SAID THIS. >> FOR FIVE YEARS HE HAS LED THE\nBIRTHER MOVEMENT TO DELEGITIMIZE OUR FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT.\nHIS CAMPAIGN WAS FOUNDED ON THIS OUTRAGEOUS LIE.\n>> AND SOME POLITICAL ANALYSTS BELIEVE IT'S TOO LATE FOR TRUMP\nTO TALK HIS WAY OUT OF BIRTHERISM, A WASHINGTON POSTOP\nED READS IN PART, QUOTE, WHILE AVOIDING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE\nACT OF FEEDING THE CONSPIRACY IN THE FIRST PLACE AND WHILE\nCONTINUING TO WINK AT THE DEPLORABLES IN HIS BASE BY\nSIGNALING THAT THEIR BIRTHERISM IS NOT JUST PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE\nBUT ADMIRABLE. SO DESPITE SAYING PRESIDENT\nOBAMA WAS BORN IN THE U.S. PERIOD, THE STORY CONTINUES.\nMEGYN. >> TRACE, THANK YOU.\nIN THE MEANTIME MRS. CLINTON TODAY SAYS THERE IS NO ERASING\nTHE BIRTHER ISSUE FOR DONALD TRUMP EVEN IF HE SAYS IT'S\nBEHIND HIM. WITHIN A COUPLE OF HOURS OF HER\nREMARKS, THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS CAME OUT TO SUNT HER\nARGUMENT. WATCH THIS.\n>> THIS IS A DISGUSTING DAY. DONALD TRUMP IS A DISGUSTING\nFRAUD. >> WE'VE HAD ENOUGH AND WE'RE\nNOT GOING TO TAKE IT ANYMORE. WE WILL NOT ELECT A CHEEP BIGOT.\n>> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ALL ARE USED TO IN THIS BUSINESS IS\nDOG WHISTLES. BUT THE THING THAT WE'RE NOT\nUSED TO, AND I'M FINDING IT VERY DIFFICULT TO GET USED TO, ARE\nTHE HOWLS OF WOLVES. >> JOINING ME NOW TO RESPOND,\nDONALD TRUMP SUPPORTER AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR GOVERNOR MIKE\nHUCKABEE. GREAT TO SEE YOU.\n>> GREAT TO BE HERE. >> IT'S FASCINATING TO WATCH\nTHIS UNFOLD TODAY BECAUSE OUR FOLKS, OUR FRIENDS ON THE THE\nOTHER NETWORKS SAID NO WAY DID HE PUT THIS TO BED TODAY AND\nSAID EVERY STATEMENT HE SAID TODAY WAS A LIE.\nYOUR THOUGHTS. >> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I THINK\nTHE",

THERE'S NONE.\n>> THEY BELIEVE THE ATTEMPTED DELEGITIMIZE THE FIRST BLACK\nPRESIDENT IS IN ITSELF BIGOTED AND RACIST.\n>> IF THEY CAN PROVE WHAT HE WAS SAYING IS BECAUSE HE WAS BLACK,\nTHEN THEY'VE GOAT AN POINT. >> THE SUGGESTION IS THAT HE WAS\nBORN IN KENYA, NOT BORN IN AMERICA.\nTHAT'S WHERE THEY BRING THE RACE?\n>> TO SAY THAT HE'S A RACIST AND A BIGOT, THAT'S NONSENSE.\nTHERE'S AN OLD RULE ALL IS FAIR IN LOVE AND WAR AND POLITICS.\nTHIS IS NOT ALL THAT UNUSUAL. WHEN I HEAR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE\nAGAINST DONALD TRUMP, WHETHER IT'S HILLARY OR THE CAUCUS OR\nWHOEVER IT IS, OR THE MEDIA, BUT THEN AGAIN I REPEAT MYSELF, IT\nSOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE SUCKING FROM THE SAME HELIUM BALLOON BECAUSE\nTHEY ALL HAVE THE SAME SHRILL VOICE AND SAY THE EXACT SAME\nWORDS, AS IF THEY'RE READING A SCRIPT.\n>> GOT TO GO.",

IT'S CRAZY.\nA MONTH LATER HE TOLD BILL O'REILLY THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA\nDOESN'T HAVE A BIRTH CERTIFICATE AND LATER TOLD NBC NEWS THAT HE\nWAS SENDING A TEAM OF INVESTIGATORS TO HAWAII TO\nINVESTIGATE. IN APRIL OF 2011 PRESIDENT OBAMA\nWHO HAD ALREADY RELEASED A SHORT FORM BIRTH CERTIFICATE IN 2008\nDECIDED TO RELEASE THE LONG FORM SAYING IT WAS TIME TO PUT THE\nISSUE TO REST.

I THINK PARTS OF THAT IS NOT THE\nBASKET OF DEPLORABLES BUT THE FACT THAT SHE HAS JUSTICE NOT\nBEEN THERE. THIS IS EVEN BEFORE THE\nPNEUMONIA. THIS WAS LIKE OUT OF SIGHT, OUT\nOF MIND. AND HE HAS IMPROVED.\nHE'S IMPROVED NOT JUST IN STATES LIKE FLORIDA AND OHIO, BUT HE'S\nIMPROVED ACROSS THE BOARD AND IN SWING STATES WITH GROUPS LIKE\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS. AND I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT\nWE'RE SEEING HERE. IT'S ALMOST ANY TIME HE LOOKS\nAND ONE TIME RECENTLY HE HAD AS LOW AS 0% IN THE POLLS AMONG\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS VOTERS.

FINE, IF THEY HAD LEGITIMATE\nCONCERNS AT THE TIME AND TRUMP DID AND AMERICANS QUESTIONED\nWHETHER HE WAS AN AMERICAN CITIZEN, WHITE HOUSE CAME OUT,\nRELEASED THE BITTER CERTIFICATE. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN A DONE\nDEAL. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT NOW\nFOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THEY\nNEEDED TO STOP THIS NONSENSE AND MOVE ON, BACK TO THE POLICY\nDISCUSSION. IT'S WHERE DONALD TRUMP IS\nSTRONG RIGHT NOW, IT'S WHERE HE'S STARTING TO CONTINUE TO WIN\nTHE SUPPORT OF AMERICAN VOTERS AND WHY THE MOMENTUM IS SHIFTING\nIN HIS FAVOR. >> YEAH.\nTHE DISCIPLINE HAS PAID OFF FOR HIM FOR SURE.\nNOW THERE WAS PUSHBACK TODAY. HE HAD THIS BIG EVENT AT THE\nTRUMP HOTEL THAT OPENED HERE IN D.C.\nHE HAD A NUMBER OF MILITARY DISTINGUISHED GUESTS AND HEROES\nON STAGE. HE SAID THAT HE WAS GOING TO\nTALK ABOUT THE BIRTHER ISSUE. THAT WAS SUGGESTED.\nAS THE MEDIA STOOD BY, THEY HAD TO LISTEN TO PERSON AFTER PERSON\nAFTER PERSON, MILITARY -- YOU KNOW, ALL OF THEM PRAISING HIM.\nNOT EVERYONE IN THE MEDIA WAS HAPPY ABOUT THAT.\nHERE'S WHAT JAKE TAPPER SAID ABOUT THAT.\n>> WHILE WE GOT RICK ROLLED AND PLAYED IN TERMS OF ROLLING THE\nENDORSEMENTS FROM THOSE AMERICAN HEROES WHO CAME OUT TO TALK\nABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND WHY THEY SUPPORT HIM, MEDAL OF HONOR\nRECIPIENTS AND THE LIKE, WHAT'S LARGELY GOING TO BE COVERED IS\nTHESE -- ARE THE TWO SENTENCES, ONE OF WHICH IS COMPLETELY\nUNTRUE. >> THERE WAS QUITE THE LEAD UP,\nCHARMS. HE'S A SHOWMAN.\nHE SCRIPTED THIS TO HIS ADVANTAGE.\n>> THE ONLY THINGS MISSING FROM THAT EVENT WERE THE TRUMP\nSTEAKS. >> I THINK THEY WERE SERVED\nRIGHT AFTER FOR LUNCH. >> THE KITCHEN AND SHOW ALL\nTHOSE OTHER THINGS. LOOK, HE HAS A WAY OF\nATTRACTINGING THE PRESS AND MAKING THEM JUMP.\nTHEY JUMP, AND THEY CAME AND SHOWED WHAT HE WANTED THEM TO\nSHOW. BUT YOU KNOW, WHEN HE SAYS OR\nWHEN -- WHEN MERCEDES SAYS THAT THIS SHOULD HAVE ENDED IN 2011,\nTHE PERSON WHO DIDN'T END IT IN 2011 AND WHO COULD HAVE WAS\nDONALD TRUMP. ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS TO SAY THEN\nWHAT HE SAYS NOW, I DON'T THINK THE INFORMATION HAS CHANGED, THE\nPOLITICS HAVE CHANGED. AND HE WANTS TO GET THIS BEHIND\nHIM. BUT HE HAS SPOKEN ABOUT IT AND\nEXPRESSED HIS DOUBTS CONTINUOUSLY SINCE 2011.\nSO HE'S HARDLY INNOCENT ABOUT THE CONTINUATION OF THIS STORY.\nBUT I THINK THEY'RE SMART, I'M SURE THIS IS KELLYANNE CONWAY\nSAYING YOU'VE GOT TO SAY THE WORDS, HOWEVER MUCH IT HURTS.\nYOU SAY IT ONCE, ADD A PERIOD THAT MEANS I'M DONE TALKING\nABOUT THIS. AND I THINK HE WILL STOP TALKING\nABOUT IT.

THAT'S JUST HIS WHOLE THING.\n>> I WANT TO YOU TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT CONGRESSMAN GK\nBUTTERFIELD HAD TO SAY ABOUT THIS.\n>> BY ANY DEFINITION, DONALD TRUMP IS A DISGUSTING FRAUD.\nHE STARTED THIS SILLINESS YEARS AGO BY SAYING THAT PRESIDENT\nOBAMA IS NOT AN AMERICAN CITIZEN.\nHE HAD NO PROOF OF IT. HE WOULD NOT HAVE DONE THAT TO A\nMITT ROMNEY, HE WOULD NOT HAVE DONE THAT TO JOHN McCAIN OR ANY\nOTHER WHITE WHO WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\n>> ONE THING I WONDER IS AFTER TODAY, THERE WAS BIG DISCREPANCY\nIN VOTER ENTHUSIASM, MANY MORE REPUBLICANS EXCITED ABOUT VOTING\nFOR TRUMP THAN DEMOCRATS VOTING FOR HILLARY, BUT I WONDER IF\nDONALD TRUMP JUST ERASED THAT. >> IT'S COMPLETELY DISGUST ING\nAND THIS IS NOT ORIGINAL TO ME, SBU BUT SOMEONE MADE THE ANALOGY\nIN A IT'S LIKE A RACIST WHITE COP WHO STOPS AN\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN DRIVER WHO IS NOT DOING ANYTHING WRONG AND\nASKED FOR HIS I.D. OBVIOUSLY THAT IS HOW PROBLEM\nSEE PRESIDENT OBAMA SEES IT, TOO.\n>> YOU WRITE THAT DONALD TRUMP IS A CLINICAL NARCISSIST WITH A\nTHIN SKIN, TOUCH WHIDEMOCRATIC TEMPERAMENT AND TASTE FOR\nFLATTERY. WHAT KIND OF PRESIDENT DO YOU\nTHINK HE WOULD BE? >> MANY MODERN PRESIDENTS HAVE\nBEEN MEN TALLY UNBALANCED. LBJ'S AIDES USED TO ARGUE\nWHETHER HE WAS CLINICAL DEPRESSIVE.\nSO TRUMP CAN GET A JUMP ON IT AND SAY I'M ALREADY CRAZY, THE\nWHITE HOUSE WON'T DO TO ME. >> YOU ALSO OBVIOUSLY HAVE\nCOVERED THE CLINTONS SINCE THE 1990s.\nINCLUDING GOING BACK AND READING SOME OF THE FIRST THINGS YOU\nWROTE ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON WHICH SURPRISED YOU.\n>> IT'S LIKE I HAVE A GIRL CRUSH ON HER.\nTHEY ARE SO SPUUPPORTIVE BECAUSI DO THINK THAT THE WOMEN TO HAVE\nTHE SAME Y'QUALIFICATIONS AS THR HUSBAND TO GET IN TO THE ROAM AS\nFIRST LADY IS VERY HARD. I ALSO PRESENTED HILLARY WHEN\nSHE PRESENTED HEALTH CARE ON THE HILL AND CALLED HER PRESENTATION\nDAZZLING, BUT THEN IT WAS SCUTTLED BY HER PENSION FOR\nSECRECY AND DEFENSIVENESS AND LOCKING UP THE PRESS WHICH SHE\nHASN'T LEARNED FROM BECAUSE WE SAW IT AGAIN LAST WEEK WITH HER\nHEALTH ISSUE. I MEAN, EVERYONE WOULD\nUNDERSTAND IF SHE SAID SHE HAD PNEU\nPNEUMONIA. I THINK SHE AND TRUMP HAVE MORE\nSTAMINA THAN ANY 20-YEAR-OLDS I'VE EVER SEEN.\n>> PEOPLE WHO DON'T DO THIS FOR A LIVING DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW\nGRUELING IT IS. AND I REMEMBER IN 2000 COVERING\nJOHN McCAIN AND HE WAS UP AND AT THE IT BEFORE ANY OF US AND YOU\nHAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO BOTH CLINTON AT 68 AND TRUMP AT 70\nFOR DOING WHAT THEY DO. IT REALLY IS REMARKABLE.\n>> AND I INTERVIEWED TRUMP ABOUT THIS, TOO, AND HE WAS TRYING TO\nCOME UP WITH HIS NICKNAME FOR HILLARY AND HE STARTED WITH THE\nSTAMINA INSULT. AND I JUST SAID THAT'S\nRIDICULOUS. SHE HAS MORE STAMINA THAN ANYONE\nI'VE EVER SEEN. AND THEN HE DID THE CROOKED ONE.\nBUT THAT WAS HIS FIRST CHOICE. BUT I'M NOT SURE WHERE HE GOT\nIT. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.\n>> YOU HAVE BEEN CRITICAL OF HILLARY CLINTON.\nWHAT KIND OF PRESIDENT DO YOU THINK SHE WOULD BE?\n>> HILLARY CLINTON STARTED AS YOU KNOW AT WELLSLY AT THIS I\nDEAL POLICI-YEAR-OLD POLICE TIC WOMAN AND SHE DOES WANT TO MAKE\nTHE WORLD A BETTER PLACE. BUT UNFORTUNATELY, SHE ALSO HAS\nA DARK DEFENSIVE SIDE WHERE SOMETIMES SHE'S MAKING DECISIONS\nFROM A PLACE OF FEAR AND INSECURITY AND THAT SIDE CAN\nTRIP UP THE OTHER SIDE. I JUST HOPE THEY DON'T BRING\nBACK MOTEL 1600 WITH ALL THE CRAZY DONORS RUNNING AROUND THE\nLINCOLN BEDROOM. >> YOU THINK SHE WILL WIN?\n>> DID I USE THAT TENSE? >> I JUST HOPE THEY DON'T DO\nTHIS. >> NO, I REPORT, I DON'T --\n>> ALL RIGHT. THE BOOK IS \"THE YEAR OF VOTING\nDANGEROUSLY, THE DERANGEMENT OF AMERICAN POLITICS.\"\nTHE AUTHOR MAUREEN DOWD.

AND SO I'M TOLD THAT PEOPLE WHO\nARE CLOSE TO HIM, HIS ADVISERS, HIS FRIENDS, ANYBODY WHO COULD\nGET TO HIM SAID YOU GOT TO HE SAID THIS AND YOU GOT TO SAY THE\nWORDS THAT HE DID SAY TODAY, WHICH IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE\nUNITED STATES WAS BORN IN THE UNITED STATES.\nBUT IT WAS HARD TO GET HIM THIS I'M TOLD.\nAND BECAUSE OF THAT, THAT IS AS FAR AS HE WOULD GO.\nSO NEVER MIND AN APOLOGY, THERE WAS NO EXPLANATION FOR IT WHY HE\nGOT THERE, WHAT CHANGED, DID ANYTHING CHANGE.\nSF HE HAVE ANY REGRETS. ALL THE OBVIOUS QUESTIONS THAT\nEVERYBODY WOULD HAVE. SO HE LEFT MORE QUESTIONS THAN\nANSWER. AND SO WHAT IT MEANS IS THATS\nNEXT TIME HE'S IN FRONT OF A REPORTER, HARD TO IMAGINE HE\nWON'T BE ASKED THOSE QUESTION, NEVER MIND THE DEBATE A WEEK\nFROM MONDAY. AND I WAS TALKING TO A\nREPUBLICAN STRATEGIST WHO KNOWS A LOT ABOUT KIND OF HOW THESE\nTHINGS WORK WHO SAID REMEMBER, IT WAS JUST SIX WEEKS AGO DONALD\nTRUMP WOULD HAVE DONE THIS KIND OF THING AND PEOPLE WOULD HAVE\nGONE, OH, EITHER HE'S ANOTHER TERRORISMISM, BUT HE'S HAD A\nNORMAL CAMPAIGN, READING FROM PROMPTER, RELATIVELY ON MESSAGE\nFOR THE PAST MONTH OR SO AND THAT IS'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY\nTHIS IS SO JARRING. >> WHAT ARE YOU HEARING FROM\nYOUR DEMOCRATIC PARTY SOURCES ABOUT THE IMPACT OF ALL OF THIS,\nDEVELOPMENTS TODAY THAT IT WILL HAVE ON THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nVOTE INTERNALLY? >> ONE OF THE REASONS WHY\nREPUBLICANS WANTED TO DO THIS IS BECAUSE THEY SEE WHAT DEMOCRATS\nARE SEEING AS WELL XHRKS IS THE OLD OBAMA COALITION WHICH RELIED\nA LOT TO GETTING OUT THE VOTE IN BIG NUMBERS AND URBAN AREAS AND\nSWING STATES WAS NOT REALLY THERE FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nSO THE HOPE WAS THAT YOU KIND OF PUT THIS OFF THE TABLE AND MAYBE\nYOU CAN KEEP THAT SUPPRESSED, IF YOU WILL.\nBUT WHAT HAPPENED REALLY I THINK GENUINELY ORGANICALLY TODAY, WE\nSAW WITH THE PRESS CONFERENCE, MEMBERS OF THE CONGRESSIONAL\nBLACK CAUCUS AND OTHERS FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT IT WAS\nFIVE YEARS OF PENT UP ANGER AND FRUSTRATION THAT CAME BURSTING\nOUT FROM A LOT OF NEVER MIND BLACK VOTERS, BUT ACTIVISTS.\nSO THEY'RE HOPING THAT THEY CAN TURN WHAT REALLY HAS BEEN\nLACKLUSTER ENTHUSIASM FOR HILLARY CLINTON, THEY CAN HELP\nTHEM TO SAY, LOOK, YOU DON'T REALLY WANT THIS GUY DONALD\nTRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE, ESPECIALLY AFTER HAVING BARACK\nOBAMA FOR THE PAST EIGHT YEARS. BUT HERE IS THE BUT.\nI WAS TALK TOOK A GM DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST AND SAID THAT COULD\nBE HELPFUL. THE BIG ISSUE, MILLENNIAL T\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS. AND THEY'RE NOT SO SURE THAT THE\nBIRTHER ISSUE WILL COMPEL THEM TO GET OUT AND VOTE.\n>> WE DID SEE THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS LEADERSHIP COME OUT\nPASSIONATELY AND DENOUNCE DONALD TRUMP.\nTHANK YOU VERY MUCH. >>> JOINING US NOW, SEAN DUFFY,\nA DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTER.",

I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT\nTO HAVE THE QUESTION ANSWERED, DO YOU BELIEVE HE'S A ZINT OR\nNOT. AND TODAY HE DID WHAT HE HAD TO\nDO AND LOOKING AT DONALD TRUMP'S RECORD HE DID IT MORE QUICKLY\nTHAN HE NORMALLY WOULD AND SAID NO, THE PRESIDENT WAS BORN IN\nTHE UNITED STATES. THAT WAS THE RIGHT MOVE ON HIS\nPART AND I THINK THIS SHOULD BE PUT TO REST.\n>> IT'S TAKEN HIM FIVE YEARS. THAT'S NOT EXACTLY VERY QUICKLY\nTO ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT WE ALL KNOW ONCE HAWAII RELEASED THE\nOFFICIAL BIRTH CERTIFICATE. >> IF YOU LOOK BACK IN HISTORY,\nYOU MENTIONED THIS EARLIER, IT WAS A CLINTON CAMPAIGN STAFFER\nWHO PUSHED THIS STORY OUT IN THE '08 RACE.\nI DON'T KNOW THAT CLINTON CAME OUT AND APOLOGIZED FOR THAT\nSTAFFER TO BARACK OBAMA FOR PUSHING THAT STORY.\nAND SPREADING THAT MISTRUTH. AND --\n>> LET ME POINT OUT WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO BECAUSE WE DID\nSPEAK TO THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN MANAGER EARLIER TODAY IN WHICH\nSHE TOLD US THAT THERE WAS PRESUMABLY AN UNPAID YOUNG\nSTAFFER IN IOWA, MAY HAVE BEEN A VOLUNTEER, MAYBE NOT EVEN A\nSTAFFER, A VOLUNTEER WHO WAS SPREADING THIS KIND OF STUFF.\nONCE SHE FOUND OUT ABOUT IT, ONCE HILLARY CLINTON FOUND OUT\nABOUT IT, THEY IMMEDIATELY FIRED THIS INDIVIDUAL AND PATTI SOLIS\nDOYLE SAID SHE CALLED DAVID PLOUFFE TO OFFICIALLY APOLOGIZE.\nSO THERE REALLY WASN'T AFTERNOON EFFORT TO SPREAD THE BIRTH ERBI.\n>> BUT DID HILLARY CLINTON APOLOGIZE TO HILLARY CLINTON AND\nI DON'T BELIEVE THAT SHE DID. LOOK AT DONALD TRUMP, I AGREE,\nSOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY IT'S FINE FOR TRUMP TO PUSH THIS ISSUE\nUNTIL THE PRESIDENT CAME OUT AND SHOWED HIS BIRTH PRESENTED THE\nCERTIFICATE, THE ISSUE IS OVER, LEAVE IT ALONE.\nBUT -- >> THERE IS NO EVIDENCE AT ALL\nTHAT HILLARY CLINTON EVER RAISED THE BIRTH PLACE OF THEN SENATOR\nBARACK OBAMA. >> NO BUT HER TEAM DID.\nAND FRANKLY, IF IT'S SOMEONE WHO HAS A POSITION THAT --\n>> BUT THE TEAM DIDN'T. THERE WAS ONE VOLUNTEER IN IOWA\nWHO WAS FIRED FOR DOING THAT. BUT THERE WAS NEVER ANY TEAM\nEFFORT IF YOU WILL TO SMEAR THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATE. >> WOLF, WHEN WE LOOK AT TEAMS,\nWIN WE LOOK AT MANAFORT, PEOPLE FRIED TO THROW IT ON HIM.\nIT GOES BOTH WAYS. CANDIDATES HAVE TO BE\nRESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR TEAM MEMBER.\nI THINK THIS COMES -- THIS IS A BIG ISSUE BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP\nHAS BEEN MAKING UP NUMBERS WITH THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY.\nTHEY WANT JOBS AND THEY WANT OPPORTUNITY.\nAND HE'S BEEN DOING GREAT OUTREACH, GOING TO\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN CHURCHES. THIS STORY DOES A REAL NUMBER ON\nHIS ABILITY TO WIN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN --\n>> SO SHOULD HE APOLOGIZE TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES\nAND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE? >> NO, I DON'T THINK SO.\n>> WOULDN'T THAT HELP HIM? IF YOU SAY HE'S TRYING TO GET\nSUPPORT WITH AFRICAN-AMERICANS, WOULDN'T THAT GO FURTHER IN\nTRYING TO GET THAT KIND OF SUPPORT IF HE WERE TO SAY, YOU\nKNOW, WHAT I WAS MISTAKEN, HE WAS BORN IN THE UNITED STATES,\nLE LET ME TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO\nAPOLOGIZE TO THE PRESIDENT? >> IT WILL NEVER BE OVER, THAT\nWON'T BE ENOUGH FOR HILLARY CLINTON OR BARACK OBAMA.\nWE'RE IN CAMPAIGN SEASON. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU\nKILL THE STORY, YOU MAKE SURE YOU ARE DEAD CLEAR THAT BARACK\nOBAMA IS AN AMERICAN CITIZEN, BORN IN THE U.S., NOW LET'S GO\nTALK ABOUT THE REAL ISSUES THAT AMERICANS CARE ABOUT.\nI SAW A QUOTE THOUGH THAT CAME FROM BILL CLINTON WHEN HE WAS\nTALKING TO SENATOR KENNEDY. THIS IS SOME OFFENSIVE STUFF\nTHAT HILLARY HAS TO ANSWER FOR, AS WELL.\nBILL SAID A FEW YEARS AGO GO THIS GUY WOULD HAVE BEEN SERVING\nUS COFFEE IN REFERENCE TO BARACK OBAMAAGO GO THIS\nGUY WOULD HAVE BEEN SERVING US COFFEE IN REFERENCE TO BARACK\nOBAMA THERE ARE SOME REAL THINGS THAT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN WAS\nDOING IN THE '08 RACE THAT I THINK WOULD MAKE FOLKS SCRATCH\nTHEIR HEAD AND GO WHAT WAS HILLARY UP TO IN THE '08\nCAMPAIGN? >> I WANT TO REITERATE --\n>> LOOKING -- >> LET ME REITERATE THAT THERE\nIS NO EVIDENCE THAT HILLARY CLINTON HERSELF EVER DISCUSSED\nTHE SO-CALLED BIRTHER ISSUE AND WHEN HER CAMPAIGN FOUND OUT A\nVOLUNTEER WAS DOING SO THIS IOWA, THEY IMMEDIATELY FIRED\nTHAT VOLUNTEER, GOT RID OF THAT VOLUNTEER AND THE CAMPAIGN\nMANAGER FROM THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN FORMALLY CALLED UP THE\nCAMPAIGN MANAGER FROM THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN AND APOLOGIZED.\n>> AND I AGREE WITH THOSE FACTS, WOLF.\nYOU'RE RIGHT ON THAT. I WAS MAKING A NOTE THAT HILLARY\nNEVER MADE AN APOLOGY HERSELF FOR A TEAM MEMBER.\nYOUR VIEWERS WILL JUDGE THAT AND VOTERS WILL JUDGE THAT ON ITS\nMERITS. BUT GOING TO DONALD TRUMP, I\nTHINK HE KEPT THE STORY ALIVE WAY TOO LONG.\nNOW IT'S BECOME A POLITICAL LIABILITY FOR HIM.\nAND I THINK IT WAS SMART FOR HIM TO COME OUT AND SAY LISTEN,\nAGAIN, I DON'T BELIEVE WHAT I HAD THOUGHT BEFORE.\nTHE PRESIDENT IS A CITIZEN. AND LET'S PUT THIS STORY BEHIND\nUS AND TALK ABOUT ISSUES THAT CAN GROW THE ECONOMY AND KEEP US\nSAFE. >> DON'T YOU THINK HE SHOULD ARE\nGUN DONE THAT ONCE THE BIRTH\nCERTIFICATE CAME OUT? >> YES, AND HE KEPT THE STORY\nALIVE WAY TOO LONG, BUT I'M HAPPY THAT HE ENDED IT TODAY\nBECAUSE IT'S A NEGATIVE STORY FOR HIM.\n>> I NEED TO YOU STAND BY. WE HAVE MORE TO DISCUSS.\nTHERE IS A LOT GOING ON TODAY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

IT'S NOT ENOUGH.\nIT IS NOT ENOUGH TO OVERCOME FIVE YEARS OF PEDDLING THIS\nTHEORY OF HIS. IT IS INTEREST TO GO WATCH HOW\nHE DOES IT. HE DID THIS SEVERAL TIMES IN HIS\nINTERVIEW WITH YOU. HE LIKES TO SAY SOME PEOPLE WILL\nSAY, THIS IS HIS WAY OF PROPAGATING THESE THEORIES.\nTHE FACT THAT HE FINDS IT EXPEDIENT TO REPLACE ONE\nFALSEHOOD WITH ANOTHER FALSEHOOD IS SIMPLY CLASSIC TRUMP BUT IT'S\nAP APPALLING.\nI DON'T THINK TODAY OUGHT TO MITIGATE IN ANYWAY FIVE YEARS\nLEGITIMACY OF THE FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT.\n>> WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT HIM TO DO?\n>> I DON'T THINK THERE'S MUCH HE CAN DO.\nI WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM ADMIT AND EXPLAIN HIMSELF.\nHE IS NOT GOING TO DO THAT. I THINK HE MADE IT WORSE TODAY\nBY, AS I MENTIONED, REPLACING THIS FABRICATION WITH ANOTHER\nONE THAT HILLARY CLINTON GOT THIS WHOLE THING STARTED WHEN\nTHERE'S SO MUCH EVIDENCE THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN PEDDLING\nTHIS THEORY FOR YEARS. I'M NOT SURE THERE'S MUCH HE CAN\nDO. I FIND IT INSAULTING HE THINKS\nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE WOULD ACCEPT THIS VERY INSINCERE ABOUT FACE.\n>> HILLARY CLINTON IS COMING OFF A VERY SEVERAL ROUGH DAYS.\nSHE LOST HER LEAD OVER DONALD TRUMP.\nIT'S NECK AND NECK RIGHT NOW. WHY IS IT THIS CLOSE?\n>> I THINK AT HEART IT'S THIS CLOSE BECAUSE WE ARE A DEEPLY\nDIVIDED COUNTRY. I THINK IN ANY PRESIDENTIAL RACE\nYOU'LL HAVE A VERY DIVIDED ELECT\nELE ELECTORATE.\nTHAT'S WHERE WE ARE IN THE UNITED STATES.\nI DO THINK IT'S GOING TO OPEN UP AGAIN IN SECRETARY CLINTON'S\nFAVOR BUT WE ARE JUST TWO POLARIZED A COUNTRY TO WALK AWAY\nWITH A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. >> AS YOU KNOW, THERE'S THE\nISSUE OF TRUST OUT THERE. A LOT OF VOTERS OUT THERE SAY\nTHEY SIMPLY CAN'T TRUST HILLARY CLINTON.\nWHAT CAN SHE DO TO CHANGE THAT? >> YOU KNOW, THOSE OF US THAT\nKNOW THE SECRETARY AND HAVE SUCH GREAT CONFIDENCE FIND IT HARD.\nWE HAVE SEEN THOSE POLLS MANY TIMES.\nI THINK SHE IS DOING THE BEST THAT SHE CAN AND TRY TO GO WIN\nTHE CONFIDENCE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\nTHERE IS ONLY SO MUCH YOU CAN DO, PARTICULARLY IN THE LAST\nCOUPLE OF MONTHS BUT I THINK SHE IS MAKING THE CASE FOR WHY SHE\nIS THE BEST CANDIDATE, MAKING THE CASE WHY SHE IS THE MOST\nTRANSPARENT. IN LIGHT OF THIS NEWS WEEK\nARTICLE THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS THESE BUSINESS INTERESTS IN\nRUSSIA AND TURKEY AND ELSEWHERE THAT COULD INFLUENCE HIS\nDECISIONS IN THE OVAL OFFICE. I THINK THE LEVEL OF\nTRANSPARENCY CONTRASTED WITH THE OH PAGE QUALITY OF WHAT DONALD\nTRUMP RESPECTS IS A PRETTY PERSUASIVE COMPARISON FOR\nVOTERS. >> HE SAYS HE WILL HAVE A BLIND\nTRUST, HAND OVER THE BUSINESS TO HIS CHILDREN AND HAVE NOTHING TO\nDO WITH IT AT ALL. IS THAT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU?\n>> NO. AND I DON'T THINK ANYBODY REALLY\nBUYS THAT. HIS KIDS SEEK BUSINESS AS PART\nOF THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION IN RUSSIA.\nYOU HAVE SOMEBODY THAT WILL SPEAK FAVORABLY WHO IS INVADING\nHIS NEIGHBORS BECAUSE PUTIN SAYS SOMETHING NICE ABOUT DONALD\nTRUMP? HOW WILL HE FEEL IF HE FINDS\nDONALD TRUMP MILLIONS TO HIS OWN FAMILY.\nYOU IMAGINE HOW PERSUASIVE DONALD TRUMP WOULD FIND THAT AS\nOPPOSED TO A SIMPLE COMPLIMENT. THERE IS NO WAY TO DIVORCE\nHIMSELF UNLESS HE AND HIS FAMILY CUT THEIR TIES TO THIS BUSINESS.\nI FIND IT INTERESTING EVEN HERE, 60 DAYS OUT, HE IS PEDDLING HIS\nOWN HOTELS. HE CAN'T LET GO OF THE PERSONAL\nWEALTH PRIORITY. >> AND HERE IS A SOURCE OF\nCONCERN FOR THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN.\nCNN RELEASED BATTLEGROUND POLLS SHOWING TRUMP WITH THE LEAD IN\nFLORIDA, FOR EXAMPLE. HE IS UP BY 3 POINTS IN OHIO AND\nUP BY 5 POINTS. IF TRUMP WINS FLORIDA AND OHIO\nPOTENTIALLY HE IS ON HIS WAY TO THE WHITE HOUSE.\n>> I DON'T THINK HE IS GOING TO WIN FLORIDA.\nI THINK OHIO WILL BE VERY CLOSE. I THINK SECRETARY CLINTON WILL\nWIN THAT TOO. THESE ARE BATTLEGROUND STATES.\nTHESE ARE VERY TOUGH STATES. THEY WILL COME DOWN TO THE WIRE.\nI THINK YOU'LL SEE SECRETARY CLINTON PREVAIL IN BOTH BUT I\nFEEL VERY OPTIMISTIC AND I HAVE A LOT OF OPTIMISM ABOUT OHIO.\nTHIS IS I THINK WHAT WE EXPECTED TO SEE EARLY IN THE CAMPAIGN.\nAT SOME POINT THE POLLS WILL TIGHTEN AND IT WILL SHOW DONALD\nTRUMP AHEAD IN SOME STATES. I AM HOPING AND BELIEVE IT WILL\nBE AN ABERRATION FURTHER IN THE FALL.\n>> STAY WUITH US. A TOP LEADER KILLED IN ANOTHER\nU.S. DRONE STRIKE. WE'LL GET MORE FROM YOU ON THAT\nAND OTHER ISSUES WHEN WE COME BACK. >>> WOE'RE BACK.\nWE HAVE MORE BREAKING NEWS ABOUT THE DEATH OF ANOTHER ISIS\nLEADER.",

SHE DOESN'T WANT GUNS.\nTAKE THEIR -- LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO HER.\nTAKE THEIR GUNS AWAY. OKAY?\nIT WOULD BE VERY DANGEROUS. >> Reporter: AND IN THE WORDS OF\nREINCE PRIEBUS, THE RNC CHAIR WHO WAS ON THE STAGE WITH DONALD\nTRUMP EARLIER TONIGHT, DONALD TRUMP IS NOT ALWAYS POLITICALLY\nCORRECT. TRUER WORDS HAVE NOT BEEN\nSPOKEN. REINCE PRIEBUS LENDING HIS\nSUPPORT TO DONALD TRUMP ON WHAT WAS A VERY BIG, IMPORTANT DAY\nFOR HIS CAMPAIGN. HE TRIED TO PUT THE BIRTH\nCERTIFICATE ISSUE BEHIND HIM. IT IS UNCLEAR THAT IS WHAT\nHAPPENED AT ALL ERIN. >> THAW VERY MUCH.\nAND TO THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN. ZEF ZELENY IS THERE.\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN THINKS THE BIRTHER CONTROVERSY IS GOING\nHELP THEM IN A COUPLE OF WAYS. >> FIRST AND FOREMOST THIS OBAMA\nCOALITION WE TALK SO MUCH. LARGELY AFRICAN AMERICAN VOTERS.\nHISPANIC, YOUNG VOTERS THAT PROPELLED THE PRESIDENT TO\nVICTORY IN 2008 AND 12 IS SUPPORTIVE OF HILLARY CLINTON\nBUT NOT AS ENTHUSIASTICALLY. THEY BELIEVE THIS WHOLE TRUMP\nCONTROVERSY WILL HELP IN THIS REGARD AND THE EARLY INDICATIONS\nARE RIGHT. SO MUCH ANGER FROM MEMBERS OF\nCONGRESS. BLACK LEADERS, OTHER, WHO ARE\nMEETING IN WASHINGTON THIS WEEKEND.\nAND THEY WERE FOLLOWING THIS TRUMP FUSE VERY CAREFUL.\nTHEY SAY THEY ARE MOTIVATED TO GO BACK TO THEIR COMMUNITIES AND\nREMIND VOTERS WHAT DONALD TRUMP HAS DONE.\nIN THEIR VIEW TRY AND TAKE AWAY, YOU KNOW, THE STORY OF THE FIRST\nAMERICAN BLACK PRESIDENT HERE. SO THIS IS VERY PERSONAL TO\nTHEM. AND THE SECOND WAY IS THIS.\nADVISORS HAVE BECOME WORRIED THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS STARTED TO\nSEEM MORE ACCEPTABLE TO SOME VOTERS.\nWE'VE SEEN HIM RISE IN POLLS NATIONALLY AND IN BATTLEGROUND\nSTATES AS WELL. THAT IS A KEY OBJECTIVE FOR THE\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN TO MAKE HIM NOT LOOK ACCEPTABLE.\nTHEY BELIEVE BY SAYING THINGS LIKE THIS, BY HAVING THIS\nATTENTION ON THIS BIRTHER CONTROVERSY, WHICH IS RIDICULOUS\nAND EVERYONE KNOWS IT IS NOT TRUE.\nTHEY BELIEVE THAT MAKES IT LOOK LIKE THE DONALD TRUMP OF OLD.\nAS OPPOSED TO THE DONALD TRUMP OF THE FUTURE.\n>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. JEFF AND OUT FRONT NOW OUR\nPANEL. I WANT TO GET TO THAT\nSPECIFICALLY IN A MOMENT. BUT FIRST BISHOP VAUGHN.\nDONALD TRUMP CAME OUT AND SAID PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA WAS BORN\nIN THE UNITED STATES, PERIOD. WAS THAT ENOUGH?\n>> NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT.\nIT IS NOT ENOUGH. AND I'M ALSO POSITIVE THAT\nEVERYONE WITHIN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY FEELS THE\nSAME WAY AS I DO. IT WAS VERY DISMISSIVE.\nAND VERY DISRESPECTFUL. WE REALLY EXPECTED HIM TO SAY\nMORE. WE ALREADY KNEW THAT OUR\nPRESIDENT WAS AN AMERICAN CITIZEN.\nSO WE WERE EXPECTING MORE. >> PASTOR SCOTT, DISMISSIVE AND\nDISRESPECTFUL? >> NO.\nHE STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE, SAID WHAT HE HAD TO SAY AND WALKED\nOFF. HE'S NOT GOING GROVEL OR BEG OR\nCRY. AND YOU KNOW WHAT AND PEOPLE\nNEED TO STOP WHINING SO MUCH. STOP WHINING.\nY'ALL WANT SOME CHEESE WITH THAT WHINE.\nWHINING SO MUCH OVER THIS BIRTH CERTIFICATE STUFF.\nIT IS OVER. IT IS DONE WITH.\nQUIT TRYING TO RESURRECT OLD STUFF.\nTRYING TO PLAY THE TRUMP CARD AS THE RACE CARD AND BRING THIS\nSTUFF UP AND MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF IT THAT IT IS NOT.\nIT IS OVER WITH. HE SHUT THE DOOR.\nOKAY. I BELIEVE HE'S BORN IN AMERICA.\nNOW LET'S MOVE ON. >> OF COURSE THIS IS NOT\nSOMETHING THAT TRUMP HAD BROUGHT UP AND LET GO.\nHE BROUGHT IT UP AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN INCLUDING MULTIPLE\nTIMES THIS YEAR. >> YEAH.\nTHIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT JUST CAN BE DISMISSED AS PAST NEWS\nBECAUSE HIS ADVISORS WANT IT TO GO AWAY BECAUSE THERE IS\nPOLITICALLY INCONVENIENT FOR A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN SELLING THIS SWILL AS THE CONSPIRACY\nENTREPRENEUR FOR FIVE YEARS. HE'S CONTINUED TO SOUND THE\nNOTES THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN AND EVEN IN TODAY'S STATEMENT HE\nLIED WELL TELLING THE TRUTHS ARE BY SAYING IT WAS HILLARY CLINTON\nWHO STARTED IT PERSONALLY TRYING TO DEFLECT AND THEN HE ENDED IT.\n>> SO LET ME ASK YOU ON THAT. YOU HAVE LOOKED INTO THIS CLAIM.\n>> ABSOLUTELY. >> AND WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND?\n? >> MY REPORTING BACK IN WING\nNUTS THESE CONSPIRACY THEORIES HAVE DIFFERENT TRIBUTARIES THAT\nLEAD TO THEM. BUT WHAT I FOLLOWED WAS THE\nSOURCE OF THE FIRST LAWSUIT AND THE PERSON WHO TOOK CREDIT FOR\nBRINGING IT TO THE LAWYER. IT WAS A CLINTON SUPPORTER OUT\nOF TEXAS NAMED LINDA STAR. SHE WAS FURIOUS ABOUT THE STATE\nOF THE PRIMARY LIKE MANY HILLARY CLINTON SUPPORTERS.\nSHE BROUGHT THE SUIT TO PHILLIP BURG AND THEY LAUNCHED IT RIGHT\nBEFORE THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY. >> SURE.\nNOT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN. >> THESE WERE HARD CORE HILLARY\nSUPPORTERS WHO WERE FURIOUS SHE LOST THE PRIMARY.\nIT PERCOLATE AND THEN PICKED UP BY CONSERVATIVES AND THEY HAVE\nBEEN CARRYING IT EVER SINCE. LOU DOBS MAINSTREAMED AND IT\nTHEN DONALD TRUMP DID MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE TO KEEP IT ALIVE.\n>> AND DOES HE THEN AS HILLARY CLINTON SAYS OWE AN APOLOGY?\n>> NO I DON'T THINK. BECAUSE IT WAS NOT RACIAL.\nIT WAS POLITICAL. IT WAS POLITICAL IN ORIGINATION.\nIT WAS POLITICAL AS IT MOVED FORWARD.\nIT WAS SIMPLY A POLITICAL MANEUVER.\nUSED THE SAME MANEUVER AGAINST TED CRUZ, QUESTIONING HIS\nCITIZENSHIP. THE DEMOCRATS ARE PLAYING ON THE\nEMOTIONS AND EMOTIONALISM AND THE SENSITIVESTIES OF BLACK\nAMERICANS BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID DONALD TRUMP IS MAKING\nINROADS INTO THE BLACK COMMUNITY.\nTHEY ARE SCARED. >> AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT\nTHAT VERY ISSUE. THE BLACK COMMUNITY AND THE\nRACIST PART OF THIS IN A MOMENT BUT I WANT TO PLAY FIRST GLORIA\nTHE BREAKING NEWS OF WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAID MOMENTS AGO AT\nHILLARY CLINTON AND GUNS. HERE SE HE IS.\n>> I THINK THAT HER BODY GUARDS SHOULD DROP ALL WEAPONS.\nTHEY SHOULD DISARM. RIGHT?\nRIGHT? I THINK THEY SHOULD DISARM.\nTHE IMMEDIATELY. WHAT DUO YOU THINK?\nYES. YEAH.\nTAKE TEAR GUNS AWAY. SHE DOESN'T WANT GUNS.\nTAKE THEIR DATABASE LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO HER.\nTAKE THEIR GUNS AWAY. OKAY?\nIT WOULD BE VERY DANGEROUS. >> ECHOES SOMETHING HE SAID THAT\nGOT HIM IN A LOT OF TROUBLE LAST MONTH.\n>> ON THE SECOND AMENDMENT. >> LOOK I THINK DONALD TRUMP WAS\nOFF SCRIPT THIS EVENING. AND MAYBE HE WANTED TO CHANGE\nTHE SUBJECT. I DON'T THINK HE WANTS TO CHANGE\nTHE SUBJECT THAT WAY. BUT THAT IS DONALD TRUMP\nPROBABLY NOT READING OFF OF A TELEPROMPTER.\nI THINK WHAT WE SAW TODAY AND IT'S BEEN ALLUDED TO BEFORE WAS\nAN ACTIVE POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY. AND THE ISSUE OF BIRTHERISM AND\nTRAFFICKING IN THESE RIDICULOUS THESE CONSPIRACY THEORIES IS\nWHAT GOT DONALD TRUMP ONTO THE NATIONAL STAGE.\nAND I THINK SOME OF HIS POLITICAL ADVISORS WHO BELIEVE\nTHAT IT COULD DERAIL HIM IN HIS QUEST FOR THE CANDIDACY.\nAND I THINK THAT IS WHY YOU HAVE HEARD ADVISER AFTER ADVISOR COME\nOUT AND SAY, INCLUDING MIKE PENCE, SAY THAT I BELIEVE THE\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS BORN IN HAWAII.\nAND THEN FINALLY THEY WANTED TO BUTTON IT UP.\nAND THEY WANTED TO BUTTON IT UP BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT IT TO\nCOME UP IN THE CAMPAIGNS. AND DONALD TRUMP WAS NOT WILLING\nTO DO THAT IN HIS OWN WAY BECAUSE HE WASN'T WILLING TO\nAPOLOGIZE. OR TO SAY I MADE A MISTAKE.\nAND HE JUST CAME OUT THERE WITH ONE SENTENCE.\nAND YOU CAN'T DELETE THE HISTORY OF WHAT OCCURRED OVER THE LAST\nFIVE YEARS ONE, SHORT SENTENCE. AND AS A RESULT, THEY HAVE\nEXTENDED THE CONTROVERSY RATHER THAN ENDING IT.\n>> ALL RIGHT. WELL WE HAVE PAUSED THERE.\nTHANKS TO ALL. NEXT HARRY REED CALLING DONALD\nTRUMP A HUMAN LEECH. TRUMP FIRING BACK AND MOCKING\nREED. WILLth WAIT TILL SOO YOU SEE\nWHAT REED IS SAYING TONIGHT. PLUS IS TRUMP IS REALLY BEING\nAUDITED, WHERE IS THE LETTER?

I GIVE HIM THAT.\nMAYBE SPEAKING FOR 40% OF REPUBLICANS I GIVE HIM THAT.\nBUT THEN THE PRESIDENT PRODUCED DOCUMENTATION IN 2011.\nAND HE CONTINUED AND HE CONTINUED AND HE CONTINUED.\nAND THAT TO ME IS THE PROBLEM.

BECAUSE REPUBLICANS AND DONALD\nTRUMP IN PARTICULAR LATCHED ON TO IT AND WOULD NOT LET IT GO.\nAS TRUMP CONSIDERING A RUN FOR HIMSELF IN 2012, HERE HE IS\nPOPPING UP ON TV SAYING WHY DOESN'T HE SHOW HIS BIRTH\nCERTIFICATE AND STARTING TO WONDER MYSELF WHETHER OR NOT HE\nWAS BORN IN THIS COUNTRY AND HE KEEPS STACKING UP THESE CLAIMS.\nIF HE WASN'T BORN IN THIS COUNTRY, WHICH IS A REAL\nPOSSIBILITY, THEN HE'S PULLED ONE OF THE GREAT CONS IN THE\nHISTORY OF POLITICS. 2011 COMES AROUND ANDBARACK OBA\nRELEASES HIS LONG FORM CERTIFICATE AND EVERYONE THOUGHT\nTHIS IS THE END OF THE STORY AND THIS IS PROOF EVERYONE THOUGHT\nIS THE END OF THE UNITED STATES BEING BORN AND ONCE AGAIN TRUMP\nSTARTS BRINGING IT UP. A LOT OF PEOPLE DO NOT THINK IT\nWAS AN AUTHENTIC CERTIFICATE HE SAID AND STARTED TWEETING\nMESSAGES LIKE THIS, AN EXTREMELY CREDIBLE SOURCE HAS CALLED MY\nOFFICE AND TOLD ME BARACK OBAMA'S BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS A\nFRAUD. AND HE CONTINUES, BEAR IN MIND\nEVERYTHING YOU'RE SEEING CAME FROM DONALD TRUMP, MORE TWEETS,\nMORE INTERVIEWS, A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL IT WASN'T A PROPER\nCERTIFICATE, AND HE DID NOT STOP.\nWHO KNOWS? WHO KNOWS ABOUT OBAMA.\nWHO CARES RIGHT NOW? I HAVE NO OWN THEORY ON OBAMA.\nHE TOLD US THAT AT CNN JUST THIS YEAR.\nSO THE BOTTOM LINE IS, ALL OF THIS WAS GENERATED BY DONALD\nTRUMP. HE SAYS HILLARY CLINTON STARTED\nIT, NOT TRUE, HE SAYS HE PUT AN END TO IT, THAT'S NOT TRUE\nEITHER. IT KEPT GOING, AND GOING.\nNO MATTER HOW MUCH HE WANTS TO SAY OTHERWISE, THOSE TWO FACTS\nREMAIN TRUE. DON?\n>> THANK YOU, TOM. THANK YOU AND GOOD NIGHT.\n[ LAU [ LAU\n[ LAUGHTER ] I NEED TO BRING IN COREY\nLEWANDOWSKI, FORMER CAMPAIGN MANAGER, AND CNN POLITICAL VAN\nJONES, MARIA CAR DONNA, AND MATT LEWIS, THE ATHUTHOR OF \"TOO DUM\nTO FAIL.\" HOW DO YOU FIGHT AGAINST THAT\nSAYING HILLARY CLINTON STARTED SAYING FACTUALLY THAT'S NOT\nTRUE. HOW DO YOU -- WHAT'S THE DEFENSE\nHERE? >> I MEAN, WHAT IS FACTUALLY BL,\nTHIS WAS A MEMBER OF THE CLINTON FOUNDATION AND ONE OF THE\nCLOSEST CONFIDENTS HAD A PERSONAL CONVERSATION WITH THE\nHEAD OF THE McCLATCHEY NEWS SERVICES AND RECOMMENDED SOMEONE\nBE SENT TO KENYA -- THIS IS HE SAID, SHE SAID.\nTHIS IS A PERSONAL ACCOUNT THAT A -- THAT A MEDIA MEMBER WHO HAS\nNEVER BEEN IN PMPUGNED. >> WHERE ARE THE RECEIPTS,\nCOREY? >> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?\n>> THE NOTES, THE E-MAILS. >> ARE WE EMPUNING --\n>> SIDNEY BLOOMENTHOL -- >> WILL YOU LET ME FINISH, C\nCOREY -- >> I NEED TO FINISH THIS.\nTHIS IS FALSE, PERIOD. >> IT'S NOT FALSE, DON.\n>> HE'S QUOTING. >> COREY YOU'RE NOT THE HOST.\nYOU CAN CALM DOWN? >> THE INDIVIDUAL AT McCLATCHEY.\n>> TAKE EVERYONE OFF THE SCREEN. OKAY.\nSTOP EVERYONE. DON'T LET ANYONE SAY ANYTHING.\nTHIS IS FALSE, PERIOD. DONALD TRUMP CANNOT DISTRACT\nFROM THE FACT THAT HE IS THE ONE WHO EMBRACED AND PROMOTED THE\nBIRTHER LIE AND BEARS THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT.\nAGAIN THAT IS CNN REACHED OUT TO SID BLOOMENTHAL.\nBRING EVERYONE",

CNN COMMENTATOR, VAN JONES,\nBRUCE LEVEL OF THE NATIONAL DIVERSITY COALITION FOR TRUMP\nAND MAYOR KAREN WEAVER OF FLINT, MICHIGAN, WHO\nIS A DEMOCRAT. SO GOOD TO HAVE ALL OF YOU ON.\nLET'S TALK ABOUT THIS. COREY, TO YOU FIRST.\nTODAY DONALD TRUMP ADMITTED THE PRESIDENT WAS BORN IN THE UNITED\nSTATES, BUT IN THE SAME BREATH, HE BLAMES THE ENTIRE BIRTHER\nISSUE ON HILLARY CLINTON. HOW DOES THAT HELP HIM?\n>> WELL, YOU KNOW, WHAT HE SAID WAS, HE PUT THIS ISSUE TO REST\nAND IT WAS AN ISSUE THAT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN SPECIFICALLY,\nSIDNEY BLOOMENTHAL RAISED WITH THE McCLATCHY NEWS EDITOR IN\n2008, AND SPECIFICALLY SIDNEY BLOOMENTHAL OF THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN AT THE TIME ASKED THE EDITOR TO LOOK INTO WHERE BARACK\nOBAMA WAS BORN AND McCLATCHY AT TIME SENT A REPORTER TO KENYA TO\nFIND OUT IF IT WAS -- >> COREY, THAT IS NOT TRUE.\n>> THIS IS WHAT McCLATCHY IS REPORTING.\n>> CNN REACHED OUT TO BLOOMENTHAL, WHO TOLD OUR PERSON\nWHO REACHED OUT, THIS IS FALSE, PERIOD.\nDONALD TRUMP CANNOT DISTRACT FROM THE FACT THAT HE IS THE ONE\nWHO EMBRACED AND PROMOTED THE BIRTHER LIE AND BARES THE\nRESPONSIBILITY FOR IT. >> IN 2008 --\n>> THERE IS NO DEFINITIVE PROOF --\n>> DON, DON -- >> HOLD ON, COREY.\nTHERE IS NO DEFINITIVE PROOF ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT\nBLOOMENTHAL. GO ON\n>> I'M READING YOU FROM McCLATCHY NEWS SERVICES FROM\n7:29 TONIGHT THAT SIDNEY BLOOMENTHAL IS ON THE RECORD OF\nASKING THIS. AND A CLINTON STAFFER IN IOWA IS\nON THE RECORD AS ASKING FOR THIS TO BE SENT FORWARD IN AN E-MAIL.\nAND MOREOVER, IT IS UNEQUIVOCAL THAT PENN, WHO IS HER LEAD\nSTRATEGIST, WROTE ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE WAS A POTENTIAL OF\nEXPLOITING BARACK OBAMA'S POTENTIAL OF WHERE HE WAS BORN.\n>> COREY, WE'RE RE-LITIGATING THIS.\nWE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT A MILLION TIMES, EVERY SINGLE FACT CHECK.\n>> BUT, NO, YOU'RE SAYING -- >> THAT IT IS FALSE.\n>> YOU'RE RAISING THEISH WITH DONALD TRUMP.\nDONALD TRUMP DIDN'T RAISE THE ISSUE.\nHE PUT THE ISSUE TO BED. TWO VERY SEPARATE THINGS.\n>> THAT'S NOT TRUE. GO AHEAD, VAN.\n>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, IT'S BIZARRE TO ME, BECAUSE DONALD\nTRUMP DOES NOT FOLLOW HILLARY CLINTON OR HER STAFFERS ON TAX\nPOLICY. HE DOESN'T FOLLOW HILLARY\nCLINTON OR HER STAFFERS ON FOREIGN POLICY.\nHE DOESN'T FOLLOW HILLARY CLINTON OR HER STAFFERS WHEN IT\nCOMES TO TRADE POLICY. BUT SOMEHOW, FOR SOME REASON, A\nHILLARY CLINTON STAFFER -- YOU KNOW, SAY YOU'RE RIGHT, SAY\nYOU'RE RIGHT! WENT ON SOME BIZARRE LARK, AND\nTHEN FOR FIVE YEARS AFTER THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES\nPUT THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE ON THE COUNTER, HE CAN'T LET IT GO.\nTHIS IS EXACTLY WHAT MY CHILDREN DO.\nDON'T BLAME ME, BLAME MY BIG BROTHER.\nMY BIG BROTHER DID IT FIRST. NO, IT WAS MY LITTLE BROTHER\nTHAT STARTED IT AND I WAS JUST FOLLOWING ALONG.\nIF YOU WANT TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, YOU HAVE TO\nTAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR OWN POSITIONS, YOUR OWN JUDGMENT,\nAND YOU CAN'T BLAME OTHER PEOPLE.\nTHIS IS EXACTLY WHAT'S WRONG WITH DONALD TRUMP.\n>> MM-HMM.

TODAY'S PRESS -- TODAY'S AVAIL\nIN WASHINGTON WAS NEVER DESIGNED TO BE A PRESS CONFERENCE, AND\nTHE MEDIA IS UPSET THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO\nASK QUESTIONS. BUT IT WAS NEVER DESIGNED TO BE\nA PRESS CONFERENCE. AND DONALD TRUMP WAS UNEQUIVOCAL\nTODAY IN HIS STATEMENT THAT BARACK OBAMA WAS BORN IN THE\nUNITED STATES. >> HE NEVER SAID HE WAS WRONG.\nHE NEVER SAID HE WAS WRONG ABOUT IT.\n>> BUT, COREY -- >> BUT YOU'RE MOVING THE\nGOALPOST.

SO I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU.\n>> THANK YOU. >> THE REASON IT'S STILL A\nCONTROVERSY, COREY, IS BECAUSE HE DIDN'T SAY THIS WAS\nDISPROVEN, IT'S WRONG, HERE'S WHY I CONTINUED WITH THE\nINNUENDOS FOR YEARS AND YEARS. HE DIDN'T GIVE FULL CONTEXT.\nINSTEAD, HE TRIED TO BLAME HIS KID SISTER, HILLARY, FOR\nEVERYTHING HE'S DONE FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS.\nAND BECAUSE OF THAT, IT SHOWS NOT JUST A LACK OF JUDGMENT IN\nPURSUING THIS, BUT NOW A LACK OF CHARACTER, IN NOT BEING A\nSTAND-UP PERSON AND TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR ACTIONS.\nAND THAT'S WHY IT'S STILL A CONTROVERSY.\nI HOPE THAT HELPS YOU. >> LOOK, LOOK, HERE'S WHAT IT\nCOMES DOWN TO, RIGHT? FOR THE LAST 24 HOURS, PEOPLE\nHAVE SAID, DONALD TRUMP DID NOT SAY, HIMSELF, THAT BARACK OBAMA\nWAS BORN IN THE UNITED STATES. IT WAS A STATEMENT BY HIS\nCAMPAIGN AND HE NEEDS TO COME OUT AND SAY THIS.\nSO YOU KNOW WHAT DONALD TRUMP DID TODAY, HE CAME OUT AND SAID\n\"BARACK OBAMA WAS BORN IN THE UNITED STATES.\"\n>> THOSE SAME VOICES HAVE SAID THAT HE NEEDS TO APOLOGIZE TO\nTHE PRESIDENT, NONE OF WHICH HE DID.\n>> NO, NO. >> THEY ALSO SAID THAT HE NEEDS\nTO ADMIT HE'S WRONG. >> WHEN IS BARACK OBAMA GOING TO\nAPOLOGIZE TO DONALD TRUMP FOR ALL THE INCENDIARY THINGS HE'S\nSAID. IS THAT GOING TO HAPPEN?\nARE WE HOLDING THE PRESS ACCOUNT ABLE\nARE WE HOLDING HILLARY CLINTON --\n>> INCENDIARY IS NOT FACTUALLY WRONG, NOT A LIE.\nAND INCENDIARY IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT.\n>> IT'S OPEN TO INTERPRETATION, AT BEST.\n>> NO. OKAY, THE TRUTH IS NOT OPEN TO\nINTERPRETATION. I WANT TO MOVE ON.\nHERE'S HOW MEMBERS OF THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS\nRESPONDED TODAY. >> SO TO LIE AND SAY THAT THE\nBIRTHER MOVEMENT WAS STARTED BY HILLARY CLINTON AND HE WAS\nFINISHING IT AND THAT HE WAS BORN IN AMERICA AND THEN WALK\nOFF, HAS GOT TO STOP. >> THIS IS A DISGUSTING DAY.\nDONALD TRUMP IS A DISGUSTING FRAUD.\nBY ANY DEFINITION, DONALD TRUMP IS A DISGUSTING FRAUD.\n>> THIS IS THE MOMENT. IT'S A DEFINING MOMENT, FOR ALL\nOF THOSE WHO WANT TO DENOUNCE BIGOTRY AND RACISM, TO STEP\nFORWARD NOW. AND TO REALLY DEMAND FIRST THAT\nDONALD TRUMP STOP IT, BUT SECONDLY, TO DEMAND AN APOLOGY\nFROM THIS MAN, BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT HIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN\nHAS BEEN ABOUT. >> SO, BRUCE, PRETTY STERN\nWORDS. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS TONIGHT. WHY SHOULD THEY CONTINUE TO\nSUPPORT DONALD TRUMP AT ALL? >> DON, I'M JUST SHOCKED.\nFIRST OFF, FOR EXAMPLE, EVER SINCE I'VE COME ON THIS SHOW,\nEVERY SINGLE TIME, EVERY GUEST THAT WE HAVE, IT'S ALWAYS BEEN\nNAME CALLING, NAME CALLING, NAME CALLING, HE'S THIS, HE'S THAT.\nAND, YOU KNOW, GUYS, AT ONE POINT, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MR.\nTRUMP WAS A PRIVATE CITIZEN. HE DIDN'T BECOME A CANDIDATE\nUNTIL LAST YEAR. AND JUST FOR THE RECORD, IN\n2007, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SHORT MEMORIES, IT WAS SO\nMUCH BAD LANGUAGE GOING ON, VAN, YOU KNOW THIS.\nYOU WORKED FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA, BETWEEN BIDEN AND CLINTON, IT\nWAS SO HARSH, THE WAY THEY WERE TREATING HIM AND WHAT THEY SAID,\nTHE CHEAP -- AS COREY SAID EARLIER, THE CLINTON STRATEGIST,\nMR. PENN, WHO SAID, WE QUESTION HIS EVEN -- HIS AMERICAN ROOTS.\nYOU KNOW, SO, AT THE END OF THE DAY, ALL PRESIDENTS WHO GET ON\nTHE BALLOT AND WANT TO RUN FOR OFFICE.\nMcCAIN WENT THROUGH IT, WAS HE BORN IN THE ISLANDS?\nROMNEY WENT THROUGH IT. PRESIDENT BUSH, HIS WAR RECORD,\nHIS MILITARY RECORD, PER SE. YOU KNOW, THIS IS PART OF THE\nVETTING PROCESS, GUYS. AND THE ONE THING THAT REALLY\nDISTURBS ME MORE THAN ANYTHING, EVERY TIME, EVERY SHOW,\nEVERYWHERE I GO, THEY TAKE THIS BIRTHER MOVEMENT, WE PUT THE CBC\nON TV, GIVE THEM A LONG TIME TO TALK, AND TRY TO MARRY RACISM\nINTO SOMETHING THAT WAS JUST WHAT EVERY\nCANDIDATE GOES THROUGH. WHEN YOU RUN FOR OFFICE -- WAIT\nA MINUTE. WHEN YOU RUN FOR OFFICE, THE\nFIRST THING WE GO DOWN THE LIST, VAN, WE KNOW THAT.\nWE CHECK WHERE YOUR RESIDENCY ARE, ARE YOU QUALIFIED?\nEVERYONE GOES THROUGH THIS. I WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO\nREALIZE IN 2007, THE HARSH THINGS THAT WERE SAID AGAINST\nPRESIDENT OBAMA, AS A REPUBLICAN, A BLACK MAN, I WAS\nTOTALLY APPALLED. LIKE, OH, MY GOD, LOOK AT THIS!\nTHIS IS THE PRIMARY. >> SO YOU'RE NOT APPALLED THIS\nTIME? >> BEG YOUR PARDON?\n>> YOU'RE NOT APPALLED THIS TIME?\n>> NO! >> DON --\n>> BUT YOU SAID EVERY TIME YOU COME ON A SHOW LIKE THIS,\nBRUCE -- >> NO, NO, A LOT OF SHOWS.\n>> I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYONE TONIGHT CALL --\n>> EVERY TIME I COME ON HERE, I WAS ON THIS SHOW A FEW WEEKS\nAGO, AND EVERY TIME, IT'S ALWAYS A NAME-CALLING, NAME-CALLING MR.\nTRUMP. HE'S A RACISM, HE'S XENOPHOBIC,\nHE'S THIS, HE'S THAT, YOU KNOW? AND THEN WE TAKE THIS BIRTHER\nAND TRY TO MARRY IT INTO THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, PUT\nTHE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS AND PUT -- MERGE IT TOGETHER?\nTHAT'S LUDICROUS! >> GO AHEAD, VAN.\nAND I WANT TO GET MARY WEAVER IN.\nSHE'S SITTING BY VERY PATIENTLY. GO AHEAD, VAN.\n>> I DON'T WANT TO TAKE HER TIME.\nI DON'T THINK WE'RE RIGHT TO -- TRYING TO MARRY IT TO RACISM.\nTHERE'S A REASON -- >> NO, SIR, Y'ALL DID IT TODAY!\nTHE CBC DID IT TODAY. >> I DON'T THINK WE'RE TRYING TO\nMARRY IT TO RACISM. I THINK THEY'RE TWINS.\nTHEY DON'T NEED A MARRIAGE CEREMONY, THEY'RE RELATED.\nAND THEY'RE RELATED IN THE MINDS OF THE KLAN AND THE ARYAN\nNATION -- >> NO.\nNO, NO, NO. >> -- TRUMP FOR HIS BIRTHER\nPOSITION. >> MARIAN WEAVER, WHAT ARE YOU\nHEARING IN YOUR COMMUNITY ABOUT TODAY'S EVENT?\n>> WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST BEEN VERY INTERESTING, NOT ONLY\nTO ME BUT TO PEOPLE I'VE TALKED TO IN FLINT, THAT WHILE\nTHIS CONTROVERSY HAS GONE ON AND ON FOR YEARS, AS WE'VE, YOU\nKNOW, HEARD PEOPLE SAYING, THAT IN 30 SECONDS UP TO SAY, YES,\nHE'S AN AMERICAN CITIZEN, HE WAS BORN HERE, AND THAT SHOULD\nBE THE END OF IT. PED AND THAT DOESN'T BODE VERY\nWELL IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nCOMMUNITY. AND THAT'S WHERE HE'S REALLY\nTRYING TO GET SOME VOTES. SO THAT'S WHY HE WANTS TO PUT\nTHIS TO BED AND MOVE ON.

THEY SHOULD DISARM.\nRIGHT? I THINK THEY SHOULD DISARM,\nIMMEDIATELY, WHAT DO YOU THINK? YES?\nYEAH. YEAH.\nTAKE THEIR GUNS AWAY. SHE DOESN'T WANT GUNS.\nLET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO HER. >> THEN HE GOES ON TO SAY IT\nWILL BE VERY DANGEROUS, TAKE THE GUNS AWAY, LET'S SEE WHAT\nHAPPENS TO HER. THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN SAYING THAT\nTHIS IS A REFERENCE TO POTENTIAL VIOLENCE AGAINST THE CANDIDATE.\nHOW DO YOU RECEIVE WHAT DONALD TRUMP JUST SAID?\n>> WELL, I THINK HE'S MAKING A VERY GOOD POINT AND THAT IS,\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS MADE HERSELF AN ENEMY OF THE SECOND\nAMENDMENT. SHE'S PUT A BIG BULL'S-EYE ON\nTHE SECOND AMENDMENT. SHE'S MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT\nSHE WANTS TO TAKE PEOPLE'S GUN RIGHTS AWAY.\n>> HILLARY CLINTON HAS NOT SAID OR INTENDED TO THAT SHE WANTS\nTO, AS DONALD TRUMP TAKE AWAY THE SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS.\n>> EXCUSE ME, YOU'RE INCORRECT. >> EXPLAIN HOW I'M INCORRECT,\nAND I'LL EXPLAIN THE FACTS. >> SHE HAS PROPOSED LEGISLATION\nTHAT WILL WHITTLE AWAY AT PEOPLE'S SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHT\nSO IT'S A MERE WORDS ON PAPER. WHEN YOU RESTRICT SECOND\nAMENDMENT RIGHTS SO MUCH THAT THEY'RE MEANINGLESS, ESPECIALLY\nIN PLACES LIKE INNER CITIES WHERE PEOPLE HAVE NO\nALTERNATIVES BUT TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM THE CRIMINALS\nWHO ALWAYS GET GUNS, NO MATTER WHAT THE LAW SAYS.\n>> OKAY. LET'S TAKE THIS IN TWO DIFFERENT\nSTEPS HERE. FIRST, YOU SAY IN INNER CITIES\nPEOPLE SHOULD, I'M PARAPHRASING, CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, WE CAN\nDO THIS IN REALTIME, THAT THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN PROTECT\nTHEMSELVES IS WITH THESE GUNS YOU'RE DISCOVERING.\n>> THAT'S TRUE BECAUSE THE CRIMINALS ALWAYS GET THE GUNS,\nNO MATTER WHAT THE LAWS. >> AND MANY OF THESE MAJOR\nCITIES, WASHINGTON, D.C., CHICAGO, THESE ARE ALREADY\nCITIES WHERE THERE ARE NO GUNS ALLOWED TO BE SOLD BECAUSE THEN\nGUN-FREE ZONES. THAT LAW, AS IMPLEMENTED LOCALLY\nIS ALREADY IN PLACE. AS DONALD TRUMP HAS SAID --\n>> LET ME POINT OUT ALSO IN CHICAGO WHICH HAS VERY STRICT\nGUN RULES. THE FACT IS VIOLENCE IN CHICAGO\nIS NOTE TOUR YUSHGS GUN VIOLENCE, THE NUMBER OF\nHOMICIDES, IT'S GONE WAY UP, 30% THIS YEAR, CINCINNATI, LOS\nANGELES. >> I HEAR YOU BUT --\n>> MANY OF THESE CITIES HAVE VERY STRICT GUN REGULATIONS, GUN\nREGULATIONS, DESPITE WHAT MRS. CLINTON SAYS IS NOT THE\nANSWER. >> BUT YOU'RE ARGUING TWO SIDES\nOF THE SAME COIN. BEFORE AND AT THE BEGINNING OF\nTHIS INTERVIEW, YOU SAID THIS IS THE ONLY WAY PEOPLE CAN PROTECT\nTHEMSELVES. AND NOW, YOU'VE SAID THAT THESE\nARE GUN-FREE ZONES AND IT'S NOT STOPPING ANYTHING.\n>> WELL, THAT'S RIGHT. OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE ARE UNABLE TO\nPROTECT THEMSELVES. THE CRIMINALS ARE GETTING THE\nGUNS AND SHOOTING WILDLY IN THOSE CITIES.\n>> LET'S GET BACK TO DONALD TRUMP AND THE CLAIM THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON IS TRYING TO DO AWAY WITH OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT.\nOR GET RID OF PEOPLE'S SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS.\nHARRISBURG CLINTON HAS SUGGEST ISSED NOT ALLOWING PEOPLE WHO\nARE ON THE NO-FLY ZONE TO BUY WEAPONS, GUN CONTROL, BUT NOT TO\nGET RID OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT. >> OF COURSE, SHE HASN'T\nSPECIFICALLY GET RID OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT, BUT AS I\nPOINTED OUT A MOMENT EARLIER, WHEN YOU SO WHITTLE AWAY THE\nSECOND AMENDMENT BY IMPOSING RESTRICTION THAT'S MAKE IT\nVIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE A GUN WITH YOU, THAT IS FOR ALL\nINTENTS AND PURPOSES GETTING RID OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT.\n>> OKAY. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT DONALD\nTRUMP SAID YESTERDAY. WHY IS HE REFERENCING THIS\nDISARMING OF SECRET SERVICE AGENTS, AND THEN QUESTIONS, AS\nYOU IS HE, LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO HER?\nWHY IS HE SAYING THAT? WHY MAKE THAT REFERENCE?\n>> HE'S POINTING OUT MRS. CLINTON'S WELL-KNOWN\nHYPOCRISY. WHAT'S GOOD FOR HER IS NOT GOOD\nFOR THE RELEVANT OF US. SHE WANTS THE REST OF AMERICA\nNOT TO BE PROTECTED BY HAVING THEIR OWN GUNS BUT SHE WANTS TO\nMAKE SURE SHE IS WELL PROTECTED. IT'S A MATTER OF HYPOCRISY.\n>> WELL, YOU KNOW, OF COURSE, THAT EVERY PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATE WITHIN 120 DAYS OF THE ELECTION, WITH SOME CRITERIA,\nGET SECRET SERVICE PROTECTION. >> YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT.\n>> AND THAT'S BEEN TRADITION. AND THE REASON THAT IT HAPPENED\nBECAUSE IN 1968, RFK, ROBERT F. KENNEDY WAS SHOT AND KILLED.\nAND THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE IT. >> WELL, AND CERTAINLY, NO ONE\nWOULD EVER WANT THAT THAT TO HAPPEN TO ANY CANDIDATE BUT\nREMEMBER, MRS. CLINTON HAS HAD BODYGUARDS AND PROTECTION FOR\nMOST OF HER RECENT ADULT LIFE. BECAUSE AS A FORMER FIRST LADY\nAND SECRETARY OF STATE, SHE'S QUITE ACCUSTOMED TO BEING\nPROTECTED BY ARMED BODYGUARDS. BUT THE REST OF US ARE NOT.\nBUT I FEEL FOR THE FAMILIES ESPECIALLY IN PLACES LIKE\nCHICAGO AND LOS ANGELES, WHERE GUN VIOLENCE SO HIGH, HOMICIDES\nHAVE SOARED BY DOUBLE DIGITS. AND THE VERY PEOPLE WHO NEED A\nGUN TO PROTECT THEMSELVES. THEY GO TO WORK EARLY IN THE\nMORNING. THEY WORK IN A SMALL CONVENIENCE\nSTORE. THEY HAVE SOME OTHER KIND OF\nDANGEROUS PLACE TO WORK, AND THEY CAN'T CARRY A GUN.\n>> THAT'S A FAIR POINT. BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT, YOU\nBROUGHT UP THE TERM \"HYPOCRISY.\" DONALD TRUMP SAID THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON'S SECRET SERVICE SHOULD BE DISARMED BECAUSE OF THE REST\nOF THE COUNTRY DOESN'T HAVE THAT PROTECTION.\nDONALD TRUMP BACK IN MAY IT WAS, WHEN HE FIRST ALLUDED TO THE\nDISARMING OF SECRET SERVICE SAID THIS IN FRONT OF THE NRA AS HE\nACCEPTED THEIR ENDORSEMENT. HE WAS SAYING THAT IN FRONT OF A\nCROWD THAT HAD BEEN REQUIRED TO LEAVE THEIR GUNS OUTSIDE OF THAT\nROOM. IF DONALD TRUMP IS SO SUPPORTIVE\nOF GUN RIGHTS AND THE RIGHT TO CARRY, THEN SHOULD HE THEN ALLOW\nPEOPLE TO BRING GUNS TO HIS EVENTS?\nBECAUSE THE SECRET SERVICE DOESN'T ALLOW THAT.\n>> I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE RULES FOR THAT PARTICULAR EVENT.\n>> IT'S EVERY EVENT. THE SECRET SERVICE DOES NOT\nALLOW PEOPLE TO BRING GUNS INTO THE CLOSED PLACES.\n>> WELL, IF THAT'S THE RULE, IT'S PROBABLY A GOOD RULE.\n>> WHICH IS ALSO THE REASON WHY THEY CARRY GUNS AT CLINTON'S\nEVENTS AND HIS. >> AT REAL ISSUE HERE, AND I'M\nGLAD HE'S RAISING IT, ONE OF THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DONALD\nTRUMP IS RAISING THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING THE SECOND\nAMENDMENT. AS YOU KNOW, PRESIDENT OBAMA\nMOCKED AMERICANS FOR CLINGING TO THEIR RELIGION AND THEIR GUNS.\nBOTH OF THOSE RIGHTS ARE DEFINITELY UNDERATTACK.\nAND I'M GLAD THAT DONALD TRUMP IS STANDING UP FOR OUR SECOND\nAMENDMENT RIGHTS. >> WE HAVE JUST A COUPLE MINUTES\nLEFT. AND I WANT TO TURN TO THE\nCONTROVERSY OF MIDDAY FRIDAY WHICH WAS BIRTHERISM.\nAND DONALD TRUMP IN 32 WORDS SAYING THAT,S SELLERLY,\nPRESIDENT OBAMA, WAS BOARD IN THE UNITED STATES, PERIOD.\nFINISHING THAT. I WONDER, DID THE CAMPAIGN OR\nDOES THE CAMPAIGN BELIEVE THAT THIS 32-WORD TREATMENT OF A\nFIVE-YEAR LIE IS ENOUGH THAT IT ENDS IT?\n>> IT'S PROBABLY OVERDOING IT. BOX THE REAL BIRTHER ISSUE --\n>> YOU MEAN THAT THE 32 WORDS WAS TOO MUCH?\n>> REM SAY -- YEAH.\nTHE REAL BIRTHER ISSUE IN THIS COUNTRY IS THAT UNDER BARACK\nOBAMA, BUSINESS STARTUPS HAVE FAILED.\nFEWER BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN BORN THAN HAVE DIED.\nTHE BUSINESS FAILURE RATE FOR -- >> HOW IS THAT A BIRTHISM ISSUE?\n>> BECAUSE AN ECONOMY SHOULD BE ABLE TO GIVE BIRTH TO NEW\nBUSINESSES ALL THE TIME. >> I UNDERSTAND THE TERM THAT\nYOU'RE USING. WE'RE NOT GOING TO SHIFT AWAY\nFROM THE TOPIC -- >> WELL, I WANT TO SHIFT TO THIS\nEXTENT. LET ME JUST POINT OUT THE VOTERS\nDON'T CARE ABOUT THE BIRTHER ISSUE.\n>> LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR -- >> THEY SAY THE ECONOMY IS THE\nNUMBER ONE ISSUE. >> I FEEL WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,\nBUT DONALD TRUMP HAS FOR YEARS PUSHED THIS LIE SAYING THAT\nPRESIDENT OBAMA WAS NOT BORN IN THE UNITED STATES.\nTHEN HE COMES OUT AND IN 32 WORDS BLAMES IT ON HILLARY\nCLINTON. AND THEN SAYS THE PRESIDENT IS\nBORN HERE. HE FINISHED IT WITH HE DIDN'T\nFINISH IT. WITH 32 WORDS IS THAT ENOUGH?\n>> YES, IT IS ENOUGH. AND LET ME SAY THIS, THE VOTERS\nWANT YOU TO TALK IT ABOUT THE ECONOMY.\nTHAT'S THEIR NUMBER ONE CONCERN. BUT THE MEDIA ELITE ARE DROWNING\nAMERICANS IN ONE STORY AFTER ANOTHER.\nABOUT BIRTHISM, BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC\nTO HEAR ABOUT DONALD TRUMP ECONOMIC PLAN TO PROMOTE REAL\nGROWTH IN THIS COUNTRY. AND HILLARY CLINTON'S ECONOMIC\nPLAN WHICH WILL DRIVE US INTO A RECESSION AND LOWER WAGES.\nTHAT CONTRAST IS SO CLEAR. TAX CUTS AND GROWTH FROM DONALD\nTRUMP. TAX HIKES AND PAY CUTS FROM\nHILLARY CLINTON. >> WE'VE GOT AN ECONOMIST COMING\nUP LATER THIS MORNING, WE'LL TALK ABOUT THOSE ECONOMIC PLANS\nINCLUDING THE CHILD CARE PROPOSALS.\nBUT I WILL POINT OUT THAT DONALD TRUMP IS THE ONE WHO INSES\nSENTLY TALKED ABOUT THE PRESIDENT, BEING BORN OUTSIDE OF\nTHE U.S. AND IN 32 WORDS ATTEMPTED TO CLEAR UP FIVE\nYEARS. >> EVEN BARACK OBAMA SAID ENOUGH\nWITH THE BIRTHER ISSUE. ENOUGH WITH THIS ISSUE.\n>> LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR BETSY McCOY THANKS SO MUCH.\n>> THANK YOU.",

DONALD TRUMP WHEN HE MADE THE\nCOMMENTS BACK IN FRONT OF THE NRA, THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE HER\nSECRET SERVICE AGENT WEAPONS TAKEN AWAY.\nHE WAS STANDING IN A GUN-FREE ZONE.\nIF HE SUPPORTS THE RIGHT TO CARRY A WEAPON, IS THAT RIGHT\nLIMITED WHEN IT COMES TO STANDING IN FRONT OF HIM?\n>> WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT DONALD TRUMP OR PRESIDENT TRUMP\nWOULD SAY. SECRET SERVICE HAS THEIR OWN\nRULES. THEY WILL ALWAYS HAVE GUN-FREE\nZONES WHEN THEY'RE INVOLVED IF THEY FEEL THAT'S WHAT IS MOST\nLIKELY TO PROTECT THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF.\nTHIS IS A COMMENT THROWN OUT THERE SHOWING THAT SHE IS\nPROTECTED BUT SHE DOESN'T NECESSARILY BELIEVE THAT\nAMERICANS SHOULD PROTECT THEMSELVES.\n>> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT POINT, SCOTT?\n>> I THINK IT'S NONSENSE. IT MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE AND\nWORDS MATTER. AND WHAT DOES THE SECRET SERVICE\nAND ALL PEOPLE WHO PROTECT US WHO ARE LICENSED TO CARRY GUNS\nHAVE TO DO WITH REASONABLE GUN CONTROL?\nCLOSING GUN CONTROL, CLOSING GUN LOOPHOLES, DOING BACKGROUND\nCHECKS, CLOSING THE LOOPHOLE IN REGARD TO BUYING GUNS AT A GUN\nCONVENTION, IT MAKES NO SENSE. AND HERE AGAIN, THE PROPENSITY\nTO SUGGEST VIOLENCE AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON IS DANGEROUS\nRHETORIC AND BEYOND THE PALE AND COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY.\n>> YOU BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT IT IS?\nYOU BELIEVE THIS REFERENCE, LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO HER IS\nMORE THAN JUST A THROW-AWAY LINE THAT WE HEARD IN MAY AFTER HE\nMADE A SIMILAR SUGGESTION? YOU BELIEVE THIS TIME HE'S\nSUGGESTING VIOLENCE AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON?\n>> THE FIRST TIME AND SECOND TIME.\nYOU'RE THROWING AWAY THAT COMMENT, TOO, IF YOU TAKE AWAY\nSECURITY, TAKE AWAY THEIR GUNS WITH THE PEOPLE THAT SUPPORT\nDONALD TRUMP, WHAT IS HE SUGGESTING TO THEM?\nWHEN HE SAYS PUNCH THEM IN THE FACE, WHEN HE SAYS THROW HEM OUT\nOF HERE. WE HAVE VIDEOS OF HIS OWN CROWD\nAT HIS RALLIES DOING JUST THAT. HE IS A DANGEROUS CANDIDATE\nBECAUSE WORDS MATTER. AND, OF COURSE, WHAT ELSE WOULD\nYOU BE LEFT WITH -- WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU BE LEFT WITH LET'S SEE\nWHAT HAPPENS TO HER. HE'S INCITING, WHETHER HE LIKES\nIT OR NOT, AN IRRESPONSIBLE APPROACH TO HER OR SUGGESTION,\nTHAT SOME OF HIS SUPPORTERS SHOULD DO SOMETHING WRONG TO\nHER, SPECIFICALLY NRA SUPPORTERS OR GUN OWNERS.\nIT MAKES NO SENSE. HE'S COMPLETELY UNQUALIFIED FOR\nTHE PRESIDENCY. >> SCOTTIE, IT APPEARS THERE'S A\nPATTERN HERE BEFORE WE SHIFT TO HILLARY CLINTON BECAUSE I KNOW\nHOW THIS WORKS. I WANT YOU TO JUST FOCUS ON\nTHIS, I COULD, AND I'M QUOTING DONALD TRUMP HERE, PARAPHRASING,\nI COULD STAND ON FIFTH AVENUE AND SHOOT SOMEONE AND NOT LOSE A\nSUPPORTER. SHE COULD WALK IN HERE AND SHOOT\nSOMEONE IN FRONT OF 20,000 PEOPLE AND NOT BE PROSECUTED.\nHER AGENT SHOULD LOSE THEIR GUNS, LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO\nHER. IF YOU SEE SOMEONE ABOUT TO\nTHROW A TOMATO, PUNCH THEM RIGHT IN THE FACE, AND I'LL PAY YOUR\nLEGAL BILLS. IT GOES ON AND ON.\nWHY DOES DONALD TRUMP USE THIS TYPE OF RHETORIC AND IS IT\nHELPFUL? >> THOSE ARE NOT THE WORDS I\nWOULD USE. I DON'T INCITE GUN VIOLENCE.\nAGAINST FRIEND OR FOE. BUT IT DOES BRING UP THE GUN\nCONVERSATION WHICH HELPS REPUBLICANS BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY\nWE'RE PROTECTING OUR RIGHTS TO CARRY.\nBRINGING INTO THAT, IT'S NOT THE WORDS THAT I PERSONALLY WOULD\nUSE. >> NOW THAT HE'S MOVED TO THE\nGENERAL? >> I DON'T THINK SO, IF YOU\nSHIFT THE CONVERSATION AND TALK ABOUT CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS ARE\nNOT NECESSARILY HIS WORD CHOICE AND THE VERBIAGE HE USES AND\nHILLARY CLINTON WANTING TO GUT THE SECOND AMENDMENT WOULD ONCE\nAGAIN RESTRICT OUR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS, WHETHER SCOTT\nWANTS TO ADMIT IT OR NOT. IT JUST GETS TO THE CONVERSATION\nTO GUN RIGHTS, THEN HE'S ACCOMPLISHED HIS GOAL.\nLIKE I SAID, NOT THE WORD CHOICE THAT I WOULD USE.\n>> SCOTT, GO AHEAD. >> I'M GLAD YOU CAN SEE THIS IS\nNOT JUST A POOR CHOICE OF WORDS BUT YOUR CANDIDATE HAS FAILED IN\nSUGGESTING VIOLENCE AGAINST THE OPPONENT.\nHOW HUMANLY INDECENT CAN THAT BE?\nAND SHE DOESN'T WANT TO GUT GUN RIGHTS.\nSHE WANTS TO RESTRICT THEM, IF WILL YOU.\nAND SHE WANTS REASONABLE GUN RIGHTS.\nIF YOU LOOK AT THE VIOLENCE NUMBERS IN THIS COUNTRY, IT\nMAKES SENSE FOR REASONABLE GUN CONTROL.\nAND IT MAKES NO SENSE TO SUGGEST THAT SHE WANTS TO TAKE GUNS FROM\nEVERYONE. AND TO TAKE GUNS FROM THE VERY\nPEOPLE WHO PROTECT US, THE FIRST RESPONDERS.\nIT'S ILLOGICAL. AND HE SHOULD STOP TALKING LIKE\nTHIS AND STOP BEING OBSESSED WITH GUNS AND BRINGING HARM TO A\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. >> SCOTTIE, WE'LL DISCUSS WHAT\nWE HEARD FROM FORMER SECRETARY GATES IN \"THE WALL STREET\nJOURNAL.\" WE'LL BRING THOSE THOUGHTS TO\nYOU.",

IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME TRUMP\nHAS CALLED ON CLINTON'S SECURITY DETAIL TO DISARM.\nHERE IS WHAT HE TOLD THE NRA CONVENTION BACK IN MAY.\n>> HEARTLESS HYPOCRITES, LIKE THE CLINTONS, WANT TO TAKE THIS\nAND THEY WANT TO GET RID OF GUNS, YET THEY HAVE BODY GUARDS\nTHAT HAVE GUNS. SO I THINK THAT IN ADDITION TO\nCALLING FOR THEM TO NAME JUDGES, WE'LL ALSO CALL THEM AND LET\nTHEIR BODY GUARDS IMMEDIATELY DISARM.\nOKAY? THEY SHOULD IMMEDIATELY DISARM.\nLET'S SEE HOW THEY FEEL WALKING AROUND WITHOUT GUNS ON THEIR\nBODY GUARDS.

SPEAKING OF CLINTON, HER\nCAMPAIGN POUNCED ON TRUMP'S REMARKS LAST NIGHT, SAYING IT'S\nJUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE THAT TRUMP'S REALLY UNFIT TO BE\nPRESIDENT. IN A STATEMENT CAMPAIGN MANAGER\nSAID DONALD TRUMP HAS A PATTERN OF ENSITING PEOPLE TO VIOLENCE.\nIT'S OFTEN UNACCEPTABLE QUALITY OF ANYONE SEEKING THE JOB OF\nCOMMANDER IN CHIEF.

THEY SAID THIS, THEY SAID WE\nHAVE EVEN MORE EVIDENCE OF JUST HOW DANGEROUSLY UNFIT DONALD\nTRUMP IS TO BE PRESIDENT OF THIS GREAT COUNTRY.\nHE'S RECKLESS, IRRESPONSIBLE AND UNWORTHY OF THE OFFICE HE SEEKS.\nSO, JUST WHEN IT SEEMED THAT TRUMP WAS GETTING BACK ON\nMESSAGE, GETTING BACK ON TRACK, WE SAW YESTERDAY THE BIRTHER\nCONTROVERSY CONSUMED HIS CAMPAIGN AND NOW WE HAVE A NEW\nFIRE STORM OVER GUNS. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WALKING\nUS THROUGH IT, CHRIS FRATES. >> MICHAEL, GOOD MORNING TO YOU.\nI'M HAVING DIFFICULTY HEARING.

KENNEDY.\nWHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM DONALD TRUMP?\n>> I FIND HIS COMMENTS TO BE ABSOLUTELY APPALLING, AS YOU'VE\nBEEN POINTING OUT ALL MORNING LONG, IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME.\nTHE STATEMENT THAT I REMEMBER IS THE STATEMENT THAT HE SAID AND\nI'M PARAPHRASES, IF SHE SELECTS THE JUDGES, THERE'S NOTHING YOU\nCAN DO ABOUT IT FOLKS, EXCEPT FOR THE SECOND AMENDMENT PEOPLE.\nWHAT DOES THAT MEAN? DOES HE WANT THE PURISTS TO TAKE\nUP ARMS AGAINST A COMMANDER IN CHIEF?\nBUT VICTOR, HE IS AGAIN A PRACTITIONER OF THIS IDEA THAT\nTHERE IS NO SUCH THING AS BAD PUBLICITY.\nIN THE SAME WAY AT THE END OF THE WEEK WE WONDERED HOW CAN BEN\nCARSON SAY HE NEEDS TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE BIRTHER STATEMENT?\nHOW CAN RUDY GIULIANI SAY WE ALL KNOW THAT BARACK OBAMA WAS BORN\nIN THE UNITED STATES. HOW CAN KELLYANNE CONWAY\nACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND THE LONE HOLD OUT WAS DONALD TRUMP AND HE\nPROLONGED THAT WHOLE PROCESS OF THE BIRTHER ISSUE AND YOU SAY TO\nYOURSELF, THIS IS TERRIBLE FOR HIS CAMPAIGN, RIGHT?\nWELL, MAYBE NOT. BECAUSE THESE ISSUES FIRE UP HIS\nBASE. IS IT GROWING THE TENT?\nABSOLUTELY NOT. IT'S NOT GROWING ANY TENT.\n>> YEAH. HE IS GOING TO KEEP THAT BASE.\nHE FAMOUSLY OR INFAMOUSLY DEPENDING ON WHICH SIDE OF THE\nAISLE YOU'RE ON SAID THAT HE COULD SHOOT SOMEONE ON FIFTH\nAVENUE AND KEEP THOSE VOTERS. I WONDER THOSE 32 WORDS HE SPOKE\nYESTERDAY AT THE END OF THAT EVENT WITH THOSE AMERICAN\nHEROES, WHO DID HE EXPECT FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE THAT STATEMENT\nALONE WOULD APPEASE? WHO WOULD THAT, I GUESS, ENDEAR\nTO HIS CAMPAIGN? >> WELL, IT WAS A WAY I THINK OF\nMAKING SURE THAT HE DIDN'T CAUSE ANY RUFFLED FEATHERS WITHIN THAT\nBASE THAT IS SO DEDICATED TO HIM.\nTO YOUR POINT ABOUT THE FIFTH AVENUE COMMENT, AS LONG AS\nHILLARY CLINTON IS HIS OPPONENT, HE'LL NEVER LOSE THAT BASE.\nHE HAS SHOWN TIME AND AGAIN THAT THERE IS NO FAUX PAS.\nTHERE'S NO MISSED STATEMENT. THERE'S NOTHING EGREGIOUS HE CAN\nDO OR SAY THAT WILL CAUSE THAT HARDENED 40 OR SO% WHO ARE READY\nTO COME OUT AND VOTE FOR HIM. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE\nDEMOGRAPHICS, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS, I JUST DON'T SEE\nHOW HE CAN GET WHERE HE NEEDS TO BE TO ACTUALLY WIN THE ELECTION.\nHOW HE CAN GET TO 270 WITH THIS MINDSET.\nHE MAY SQUEEZE EVERY LAST VOTER IN HIS CONSTITUENCY OUT TO VOTE\nFOR HIM, BUT IT WON'T BE ENOUGH, UNLESS SOMEHOW HE BUILDS A\nBRIDGE OR TWO. >> MICHAEL SMER CONNISH, SO GOOD\nTO HAVE YOU THIS MORNING. >> GOOD TO SEE YOU.\n>> I KNOW YOU HAVE SOME PREP TO DO YOUR SHOW COMING UP NEXT HOUR\n9:00 A.M.

AND I THINK WHAT SHE'S GOING TO\nDO IS CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT HER MESSAGE OF LIFTING PEOPLE UP, OF\nSTRONGER TOGETHER, OF MAKING SURE THAT WE PUT TOGETHER\nPOLICIES IN THIS COUNTRY THAT HELP EVERYBODY, THAT LEVEL THE\nPLAYING FIELD, SO THAT THIS ECONOMY WORKS FOR EVERYBODY, NOT\nJUST THE TOP 1% OF THE COUNTRY. AND IN TERMS OF NATIONAL\nSECURITY, ALREADY THE MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DO TRUST\nHER. I RESPECT BOB GATES' OPINION.\nHE IS VERY WELL RESPECTED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE.\nWE ALREADY HAVE HUNDREDS OF NATIONAL SECURITY EXPERTS, TOP\nOFFICIALS IN THE REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATION OF BOTH\nPRESIDENTS BUSH, WHO HAVE COME OUT AND NOT JUST SAID THAT\nDONALD TRUMP IS TEMPERAMENTALLY UNFIT TO SERVE AND THAT HE WOULD\nBE A DANGER TO NATIONAL SECURITY BUT ARE ACTUALLY SUPPORTING\nHILLARY CLINTON. >> ALL RIGHT.\nBUT HI STILL HAS A LOT OF QUESTIONS.\nHE IS VERY OPEN ABOUT THAT THIS MORNING IN THIS OP-ED.\n>> SURE. >> ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON, ALSO\nQUESTIONS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, CALLING DONALD TRUMP BEYOND\nREPAIR AND, QUOTE, UNINFORMED DONALD TRUMP TWEETING A LITTLE\nWHILE AGO, JEFFREY, SAYING I NEVER MET FORMER SECRETARY\nROBERT GATES. LOOK AT THE RESULTS UNDER HIS\nGUIDANCE, A TOTAL DISASTER. YOUR RESPONSE?\n>> YOU KNOW, I LIKE BOB GATES. I THINK HE IS TERRIFIC.\nBUT I HAVE TO SAY THIS IS VERY MUCH THE ESTABLISHMENT VIEW OF\nDONALD TRUMP. I MEAN, IT SPEAKS EXACTLY,\nEXACTLY TO ALL THESE FOREIGN POLICY OFFICIALS WHO SIGNED OFF\nON THESE LETTERS OPPOSING DONALD TRUMP.\nMEANWHILE, HE'S GOT SERIOUS PEOPLE ADVISING THEM.\nGENERAL FLYNN, WHO I MIGHT ADD AS THE HEAD OF THE DEFENSE\nINTELLIGENCE AGENCY COULDN'T IMAGINE TO GET A MEETING WITH\nPRESIDENT OBAMA THE ENTIRE TIME HE WAS THERE.\nI MEAN, THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO SOME OF THESE PEOPLE WHO MADE\nSERIOUSLY BAD DECISIONS IN FOREIGN POLICY AND THEY'RE\nBASICALLY TALKING TO EACH OTHER. THEY'RE OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE AND WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT IN A STRONG\nFOREIGN POLICY PRESIDENT. AND I MIGHT ADD HE DOES HAVE THE\nTEMPERAMENT. HE'S BUILT THIS ENORMOUS\nENTERPRISE. HE IS THE ONE WITH THE GOOD\nTEMPERAMENT. SHE IS THE ONE WHO IN BIOGRAPHY\nAFTER BIOGRAPHY IS PICTURED AS LOSING HER TEMPER AND\nTHROWING -- >> COME ON, JEFFREY.\nTHAT'S RIDICULOUS. WE DON'T WANT TO ELECT A\nCONSPIRACY THEORIST IN CHIEF. >> JEFFREY LORD, MARIA CARDONA,\nALSO A SPIRITED CONVERSATION. ALWAYS GRATEFUL TO HAVE YOU\nHERE. >> THANKS, CHRISTI.\n>> THANK YOU MARXRRHEA. >> STAY WITH US.\nYOU CERTAINLY WANT TO LISTEN TO THIS 911 CALL MADE BY KIDNAPPED\nVICTIM.

AND THEN TRUMP WANDERED ALOUD\nABOUT CLINTON'S SECURITY DETAIL. >> I THINK THAT HER BODY GUARDS\nSHOULD DROP ALL WEAPONS. THEY SHOULD DISARM.\nRIGHT? RIGHT?\nI THINK THEY SHOULD DISARM. IMMEDIATELY.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK? YES, YES.\nYEAH. TAKE THEIR GUNS AWAY, SHE\nDOESN'T WANT GUNS. LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO HER.\n>> THIS COMES AS TRUMP TRIES TO PIVOT AWAY FROM HIS BIRTHER\nCLAIMS. THAT WAS YESTERDAY, NOW SAYING\nTHE ACTUAL WORDS THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS BORN IN THE U.S.\nBUT FALSELY BLAMING THE BIRTHER MOVEMENT ON HILLARY CLINTON.\nCLINTON'S CAMPAIGN IS RESPONDING THIS MORNING WITH A WEB VIDEO\nOUT JUST A FEW MOMENTS AGO. WATCH PART OF IT.\n>> BARACK OBAMA WAS BORN IN THE UNITED STATES.\nPERIOD. >> YOU DON'T STILL QUESTION HE\nWAS BORN IN THE UNITED STATES, DO YOU?\n>> I HAVE NO IDEA. >> HERE'S THE THING, JUST OVER\n50 DAYS TO GO UNTIL ELECTION DAY, THE POLLS ARE TIGHTENING,\nTHE CANDIDATES AND THEIR SURROGATES HITTING THE BATTLE\nGROUND STATES TODAY. CNN'S CHRIS FRATES IS KIND OF\nMONITORING ALL OF IT, GOOD MORNING TO YOU.\n>> GOOD MORNING, YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT.\nIT'S BATTLE GROUND SATURDAY OUT THERE ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL WITH\nCANDIDATES AND ALL OF THEIR SURROGATES STUMPING IN KEY SWING\nSTATES. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE MAP,\nGET A SENSE OF WHERE THE POLITICS ARE POPPING TODAY.\nIN OHIO, THEY'RE GOING TO SEE THE MOST ACTION WITH SENATORS\nBERNIE SANDERS AND ELIZABETH WARREN.\nSTUMPING THERE FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nDONALD TRUMP, HE'S HEADED OUT WEST, GOING TO COLORADO.\nAND MIKE PENCE HE'S HEADED TO THE SUNSHINE STATE OF FLORIDA.\nHILLARY CLINTON IS NOT IN A SWING STATE.\nSHE'S DOING A FUNDRAISER AND A DINNER HERE IN WASHINGTON, D.C.\nBUT HER CSURROGATES ARE OUT IN FORCE IN OHIO.\nWARREN AND SANDERS WILL BE WORKING HARD TO TURN OUT TWO KEY\nGROUPS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN FANS OF HILLARY CLINTON, THOSE ARE YOUNG\nPEOPLE AND PROGRESSIVES. A RECENT CNN ORC POLL SHOWS THAT\nCLINTON HAS WORK TO DO THERE. SHE'S TRYING TRUMP BY FIVE\nPOINTS. 41% TO 46%.\nON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, MIKE PENCE HEADS TO A RETIREMENT\nCOMMUNITY IN FLORIDA. SUNSHINE STATE, FLORIDA, AND A\nCNN ORC POLL OF LIKELY VOTERS THERE SHOWS TRUMP AND CLINTON IN\nA DEAD HEAT WITH TRUMP EDGING OUT CLINTON 47% TO 44%.\nTHAT'S INSIDE THE MARGIN OF ERROR.\nRAZOR THIN FOR DONALD TRUMP. TRUMP HIMSELF IS HEADED OUT TO\nTHE CONSERVATIVE BASTION OF COLORADO SPRINGS TONIGHT.\nHE'S TRYING TO PUT COLORADO BACK INTO THE REPUBLICAN COLUMN AFTER\nPRESIDENT OBAMA TURNED IT BLUE STARTING BACK IN HIS FIRST RUN\nAGAINST JOHN McCAIN IN 2008. ALL OF THIS CAMPAIGNING COMES AS\nTHE POLLS HAVE TIGHTENED THIS MONTH IN SEPTEMBER.\nCNN'S MOST RECENT POLL OF POLLS, SHOWS CLINTON EDGING TRUMP\nNATIONALLY BY JUST TWO POINTS. 43% TO 41%.\nSO A LOT TO WATCH ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\n>> HEY, CHRIS FRATES, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BREAKING IT DOWN FOR\nUS. >> MOMENTS AGO, THE DEPARTMENT\nOF HOMELAND SECURITY RELEASED A STATEMENT OF DONALD TRUMP'S\nCOMMENT TO DISARM CLINTON'S SECRET SERVICE DETAIL.\nIT'S A LONG-STANDING POLICY OF THE DEPARTMENT AND U.S. SECRET\nSERVICE WE DO NOT DISCUSS THE PROJECTIVE APPARATUS TACTICS,\nTECHNIQUES OR PROCEDURES AROUND ANY PROTECTEE.\nLET'S BRING IN THE CO-CHAIR OF WOMEN VOTE TRUMP AND A DONALD\nTRUMP SUPPORTER AND FARRON JOHNSON, A HILLARY CLINTON\nSUPPORTER. GOOD MORNING.\n>> GOOD MORNING. >> AMY, I WANT TO START WITH YOU\nTHIS COMMENT FROM DONALD TRUMP WHERE HE SAYS LETS SEE WHAT\nHAPPENS TO HER. BEFORE WE GET TO GUN POLICY, GUN\nRIGHTS AND GUN CONTROL, WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY THAT PHRASE FROM\nYOUR PERSPECTIVE? LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO HER.\n>> WELL, VICTOR, I THINK HE WAS JUST TALKING CONVERSATIONAL\nSTYLE TO HIS SUPPORTERS THERE. I DON'T THINK DONALD TRUMP WANTS\nANYTHING TO HAPPEN TO HILLARY CLINTON.\nIT WAS A WEEK AGO WHEN SHE GOT SICK AND OFF THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL\nAND HE SAID AT ONE OF HIS EVENTS THAT HE HOPED THAT SHE GOT\nBETTER AND RETURNED TO THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL BECAUSE HE LIKED\nTHE COMPETITION. SO TO THINK THAT HE MEANT\nANYTHING ELSE, I THINK HE WAS JUST TRYING TO SHOW THE\nHYPOCRISY OF ONE SET OF RULES FOR HER AND ANOTHER SET OF RULES\nFOR REGULAR PEOPLE. >> LET ME ASK YOU, IN YOUR HEART\nOF HEARTS, I KNOW THAT SO CLOSE TO AN ELECTION CAMPAIGNS GO FOR\nANY GAFFE ON ANY SIDE. DO YOU BELIEVE SINCERELY THAT\nDONALD TRUMP WAS TRYING TO SEND A SIGNAL FOR SOMEONE TO ACT OUT\nVIOLENTLY AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON?\nDO YOU BELIEVE THAT WAS WHAT HE WAS TRYING TO SAY?\n>> HE IS BASICALLY CONTINUING EVERYTHING HE'S DONE THE ENTIRE\nCAMPAIGN. LET'S FACE IT, SINCE HE'S BEEN\nRUNNING FOR OFFICE. HE'S BEEN INCITING VIOLENCE AT\nHIS RALLIES, HE'S MADE THESE COMMENTS EARLIER ON ABOUT\nHILLARY CLINTON SAYING TO SECOND AMENDMENT SUPPORTERS IF SHE\nBECOMES PRESIDENT, SHE'S GOING TO APPOINT JUSTICES THAT WOULD\nTAKE YOUR GUNS AWAY. I THINK HE MADE A BIG GAFFE BY\nGOING FAR BEYOND. IF YOU LOOK AT THAT SPEECH, HE\nWENT OFF SCRIPT AGAIN. HIS CAMPAIGN SPENT THE LAST WEEK\nAND A HALF TRYING TO MAKE HIM MORE PRESIDENTIAL.\nTRY TO PUT HIM MORE OF -- HE DID IT.\nDO I THINK THAT HE WANTS HILLARY CLINTON TO BE MURDERED OR SHOT?\nNO. DO I THINK HE'S USING IT AS\nANOTHER DOG WHISTLE MOMENT TO HIS SUPPORTERS, ABSOLUTELY.\n>> WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION ON THE OTHER SIDE\nOF THIS COMMERCIAL BREAK. STAY WITH US.\nWE'VE GOT A LOT TO TALK ABOUT, INCLUDING THE SCATHING EDITORIAL\nFROM A FORMER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE WHO SERVED UNDER BUSH\nAND OBAMA. HE'S BLASTING BOTH HILLARY\nCLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP. WE'LL HAVE A PORTION OF THAT FOR\nYOU. HE SAYS ONE OF THEM IS BEYOND\nREPAIR. HOW HE'S SIZING UP THE NEXT\nCOMMANDER IN CHIEF POTENTIALLY.",

THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THE\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES CAN DO.\nNEVER THE LESS, THAT'S THE COMMENT HE'S BEEN MAKING OUT ON\nTHE CAMPAIGN TRAIL WITH THAT LATEST TWIST, WHICH IS AWFULLY\nINAPPROPRIATE. IT'S A COMMENT THAT THE SECRET\nSERVICE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY ISN'T\nCOMMENTING ON. YOU CAN REST ASSURED THERE ARE\nPEOPLE INSIDE BOTH OF THOSE AGENCIES THAT ARE PROBABLY\nPRETTY UPSET WITH WHAT DONALD TRUMP HAD TO SAY LAST NIGHT.\nHE WILL BE HERE IN A FEW HOURS HERE IN HOUSTON TO TALK TO THIS\nGROUP WHICH IS MADE UP OF FAMILIES OF VICTIMS WHO WERE\nKILLED BY UNDOCUMENTED CRIMINALS.\nTHIS WILL BE A CHANCE FOR DONALD TRUMP TO ONCE AGAIN TALK ABOUT\nHIS PROPOSAL FOR A WALL ON THE U.S. MEXICAN BORDER, FOR HIS\nPROPOSAL FOR DEALING WITH THE UNDOCUMENTED.\nBUT, OF COURSE, YOU KNOW, THIS COMES ONE DAY FREDRICKA AFTER HE\nMADE THAT BIRTHER REVERSAL IN WASHINGTON, D.C.\nWHERE HE FINALLY CAME OUT AND SAID, ACKNOWLEDGED THE REALITY\nTHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS BORN IN THE UNITED STATES.\nSO THERE IS A WHOLE SLUE OF ISSUES WE'LL BE WAITING TO SEE\nIF DONALD TRUMP COMMENTS ON WHEN HE TALKS TO THIS GROUP IN A FEW\nHOURS. >> JIM ACOSTA, WE'LL CHECK BACK\nWITH YOU THERE IN HOUSTON. THANK YOU SO MUCH.\nNOW LET'S FOCUS ON THE TRUMP FALLOUT OVER HIS COMMENTS OF\nDISARMING HILLARY CLINTON'S BODY GUARDS, SECRET SERVICE.\nCHRIS FRATES IS HERE WITH ME NOW AT A CLOSER LOOK.\nIT'S HIS COMMENTS TO FOLLOW, LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO HER,\nQUOTE, END QUOTE. ALSO A LIST OF RESPONSES FROM\nCLINTON'S CAMP. >> GOOD TO SEE YOU HERE IN\nWASHINGTON TODAY, FRED. >> YES.\n>> VERY COOL. DONALD TRUMP HAS SUGGESTED\nBEFORE THAT HILLARY CLINTON'S SECURITY DETAIL SHOULD BE\nDISARMED. LAST NIGHT HE WENT FURTHER THAN\nEVER. >> YOU KNOW, SHE'S VERY MUCH\nAGAINST THE SECOND AMENDMENT. SHE WANTS TO DESTROY YOUR SECOND\nAMENDMENT. GUNS.\nGUNS, GUNS, RIGHT? I THINK WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS SHE\nGOES AROUND WITH ARMED BODY GUARDS LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN\nBEFORE. I THINK THAT HER BODY GUARDS\nSHOULD DROP ALL WEAPONS. THEY SHOULD DISARM.\nRIGHT? RIGHT?\nI THINK THEY SHOULD DISARM. IMMEDIATELY.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK? YES?\nYES. YEAH.\nTAKE THEIR GUNS AWAY. SHE DOESN'T WANT GUNS.\nLET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO HER. TAKE THEIR GUNS AWAY.\nOKAY? IT WOULD BE VERY DANGEROUS.\n>> TRUMP LATER DOUBLED DOWN ON HIS COMMENTS AS HE OFTEN DOES ON\nTWITTER. IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT\nTRUMP IS REALLY EXAGGERATING CLINTON'S POSITION.\nSHE HAS NEVER ADVOCATED FOR GETTING RID OF GUNS OR THE\nSECOND AMENDMENT FOR THAT MATTER.\nSHE HAS CALLED FOR TIGHTENING ACCESS TO GUNS.\nSPEAKING OF CLINTON, HER CAMPAIGN POUNCED ON TRUMP'S\nREMARKS LAST NIGHT SAYING IT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE THAT TRUMP IS\nUNFIT TO BE PRESIDENT. IN A STATEMENT CAMPAIGN MANAGER\nROBBY MOOK SAID THIS, DONALD TRUMP HAS A PATTERN OF INCITING\nPEOPLE TO VIOLENCE. IT'S AN UNACCEPTABLE QUALITY IN\nANYONE SEEKING THE JOB OF COMMANDER IN CHIEF.\nTHIS KIND OF TALK SHOULD BE OUT OF BOUNDS FOR A PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATE. SO JUST WHEN TRUMP SEEMED TO BE\nGETTING HIS MESSAGE BACK ON TRACK HERE, HE WAS GETTING BACK\nON MESSAGE, WE SAW THE BIRTHER CONTROVERSY EXPLODE YESTERDAY.\nAND NOW THIS -- >> IT'S BEEN UPSTAGED.\n>> BY THE FIRE STORM OVER GUNS. THIS IS NOT WHERE THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN WANTED TO BE. >> HE HAD BEEN IN THE PATTERN OF\nSTICK STICKING TO SCRIPT.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH. WE'LL CHECK BACK WITH YOU.\nAPPRECIATE IT. LET'S DISCUSS ALL OF THIS WITH\nCNN'S SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST RON BROWN SSTEIN AND WE'RE JOIN\nBY LARRY SABADO. GOOD TO SEE BOTH OF YOU.\n>> GOOD MORNING. >> OKAY, YOU KNOW, WE'RE TALKING\nABOUT THIS BACKPLASH TO TRUMP'S COMMENTS.\nFORMER CONGRESSWOMAN GABBY GIFFORDS PUT OUT THIS STATEMENT.\nTONIGHT WE HAVE MORE EVIDENCE OF HOW DANGEROUSLY UNFIT DONALD\nTRUMP IS TO BE PRESIDENT OF THIS GREAT COUNTRY.\nHE'S RECKLESS, IRRESPONSIBLE AND UNWORTHY OF THE OFFICE HE SEEKS.\nRON, YOU FIRST THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME TRUMP HAS MADE THESE\nKINDS OF COMMENTS, REMEMBER, THE SECOND AMENDMENT PEOPLE COMMENT,\nCHRIS WAS REMINDING US OF THAT. HOW DO YOU INTERPRET WHAT HE DID\nLAST NIGHT AND WHY? >> LIKE MANY DONALD TRUMP\nCOMMENTS THEY ARE AMBIGUOUS, THEY POINT TO ONE DIRECTION AND\nLEAVE ENOUGH OF AN OUT THAT I DIDN'T MEAN THAT.\nI WAS NOT INCITING VIOLENCE. THIS RACE HAS GOTTEN TIGHTER\nBECAUSE THE EVENTS OF THE PAST FEW WEEKS HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE\nDOUBTS MANY PEOPLE HAVE AROUND HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHIS COMMENT GOES TOWARDS THE PRINCIPLE VOLNERABILITY DONALD\nTRUMP HAS. >> MEANING?\n>> 60% OF AMERICANS SAY HE IS NOT QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT.\nCOMPARABLE NUMBERS SAY HE DOESN'T HAVE THE TEMPERMENT TO\nBE PRESIDENT. EVEN THOUGH THE OVERALL RACE IS\nTIGHTENING AS CLINTON'S VULNERABILITY HAS MOVE TODAY THE\nFOREFRONT. NONE OF THAT HAS CHANGED BY\nDONALD TRUMP. THOSE COMMENTS ARE EXACTLY WHY\nYOU SEE THOSE NUMBERS AND FOR THAT MATTER YOU SEE SOMEONE LIKE\nROBERT GATES, THE FORMER CIA DIRECTOR FOR GEORGE H.W. BUSH\nJOIN THE LIST OF REPUBLICAN NATIONAL SECURITY OFFICIALS WHO\nSAY HE'S NOT QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT.\nHIS PROBLEM -- >> PENNING THAT IN THE WALL\nSTREET JOURNAL. TRUMP JUSTIFYING HIS REMARKS BY\nSAYING CLINTON WANTS TO DESTROY THE SECOND AMENDMENT.\nLET'S BE CLEAR AS CHRIS DID AT THE VERY BEGINNING THERE IS NO\nEVIDENCE OF THAT. THERE IS REFORM THAT SHE HAS\nBEEN PUSHING FOR, BUT NOT THE ELIMINATION OF THE SECOND\nAMENDMENT OR TAKING EVERYONE'S GUNS AWAY.\nSO WHY DOES TRUMP CONTINUE TO PUSH THIS NARRATIVE?\n>> BECAUSE IT EXCITES HIS BASE. AND HE FEEDS OFF THE ENERGY IN\nTHOSE RALLIES. AND THE NRA IS SUPPORTING HIM\nSTRONGLY. LOOK, I STUDIED THE\nCONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT PROCESS.\nTHERE IS ZERO CHANCE -- I DO MEAN ZERO THAT THE SECOND\nAMENDMENT WILL EVER BE STRUCK FROM THE U.S. CONSTITUTION.\nSO IF ANYBODY'S WORRIED ABOUT THAT THEY NEED TO FIND SOMETHING\nREAL TO WORRY ABOUT. FRED, LET ME ADD SOMETHING HERE.\nWE DID A LITTLE STUDY ON MY CRYSTAL BALL WEBSITE AND WE\nFOUND THAT EVERY TIME EITHER CLINTON OR TRUMP BECOMES THE\nFOCUS OF MEDIA COVERAGE HE OR SHE DROPS INTHE POLLS.\nHILLARY CLINTON WAS THE FOCUS BECAUSE OF THE LIE ABOUT HER\nHEALTH AND THE BASKET OF DEPL\nDEPLORABLES. DONALD TRUMP JUST STEPPED IN IT,\nNOT ONCE, BUT TWICE. THE BIRTHERISM MATTER WHICH WAS\nTRULY AN OUTRAGE ON FRIDAY. AND THEN ESSENTIALLY SUGGESTING\nTHAT HARM WOULD COME TO HILLARY CLINTON ONCE HER SECRET SERVICE\nAGENTS WERE DISARMED. RON, I LOVE YOU.\nBUT -- WE HARDLY EVER DISAGREE. I DON'T THINK THAT WAS AMBIGUOUS\nIN THE SLIGHTEST. >> ALL RIGHT.\nRON AND LARRY, WE'RE GOING TO GET TO CONVERSATION.\nSTICK WITH US WE'LL TALK ABOUT IMMIGRATION COMING UP.\nTO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE CANDIDATES' PERSONAL LIVES WATCH\nTHE ESSENTIALS STARTING TONIGHT AT 10:00 EASTERN.\nBOTH AIRING TONIGHT ON CNN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.",

IT WILL LIKELY BE A FOREIGN\nCRISIS. THE QUESTION THAT ROBERT GATES\nLAYS OUT IN THAT COLUMN IS, WHICH CANDIDATE IS BETTER\nPREPARED TO DEAL WITH THESE FOREIGN CRISES AND HE SAYS IN\nTHAT COLUMN, HE'S NOT HAPPY WITH HILLARY CLINTON, HE HOPES SHE\nPROVIDES MORE DETAILS AS TO WHAT SHE WOULD DO WITH A NUMBER OF\nISSUES HAPPENING AROUND THE WORLD, HE COMES TO THE\nCONCLUSION IN THIS OP-ED THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS BEST PREPARED\nTO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nDONALD TRUMP IS TOO MUCH OF A LOOSE CANNON TO BE TRUSTED IN\nTHE OVAL OFFICE. THAT IS A COMPELLING ARGUMENT\nTHAT A LOT OF AMERICANS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH.\nI AGREE 100% WITH JOSH ROGGIN, WHAT HE SAID, HAVING COVERED\nDONALD TRUMP FOR THE LAST EIGHT O OR NINE MONTHS YOU HAVE THIS\nOMG MOMENT FROM TRUMP ON A DAILY BASIS THAT ECLIPSES THE PREVIOUS\nDAY'S OMG MOMENT. NOW WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WHAT HE\nSAID ABOUT GUNS AND HILLARY CLINTON INSTEAD OF THE BIRTHER.\nSOME OF IT IS ACCIDENTAL AND SOME JUST COMES OUT OF HIS\nMOUTH. YOU ARE RIGHT, WHAT JOSH SAID IS\nEXACTLY RIGHT, IT GIVES DONALD TRUMP ALMOST ON A DAILY BASIS, A\nCHANCE TO AVOID THE SERIOUS ISSUES BECAUSE OF THAT DYNAMIC.\n>> JOSH, YOU WANT TO TAKE CREDIT ON ROBERT GATES OP-ED?\n>> WHAT HAPPENED WAS DOZENS OF GOP NATIONAL SECURITY SAID NEVER\nTRUMP. HE'S NOT SERIOUS.\nHILLARY CLINTON IS NOT WHAT THEY WANT, THEY HAVE TO STAND ON\nPRINCIPLE. THE PEOPLE WHO HAD NOT DONE THAT\nRR ROBERT GATES, CONDOLEEZZA RICE, HADLEY, JAMES SCHULTZ,\nSORRY, GEORGE SCHULTZ, JAMES BAKER.\nTHEY HAD BEEN SLAMMING.

HE'S IGNORANT AND DOESN'T TAKE\nTHIS STUFF SERIOUSLY THAT'S A BIG THING IN REPUBLICAN FOREIGN\nPOLICY CIRCLES. >> IF DONALD TRUMP LOSES, SEEM\nTHAG IT'S NECK IN NECK, IF TRUMP WINS, AT LEAST ROBERT GATES PUT\nHIMSELF ON RECORD SAYING THIS IS WHAT I THINK ABOUT LEADERSHIP.\n>> MOST OF THEM EXPECT HIM TO LOSE, BUT THEY ARE NOT SURE.\nTHEY EXPECT A FIGHT TO COME AFTER HE LOSES.\nHA HALF THE PARTY IS PRO-TRUMP.\nTHEY WANT TO BE POSITIONED AND SAY WHEN IT WAS TIME TO\nSTAND-UP, I STOOD UP AND SAID WHAT I FELT.\n>> WE'LL CHECK BACK WITH YOU AS DONALD TRUMP ADDRESSES THE CROWD\nAT THAT LUNCHEON.

THEY USE LANGUAGE IN A CAMPAIGN\nCONTEXT. IF HE DOES BECOME ELECTED, HE\nNEEDS TO THINK TWICE ABOUT THE WORDS HE USES BECAUSE THEY WILL\nHAVE IMPLICATIONS ON THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND OUR POLITICAL ROLE\nIN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. >> CAPRI CAFARO, SCOTTIE HUGHES,\nTHANK YOU.",

I THINK HIS STRATEGY DURING THE\nPRIMARIES WAS TO BASICALLY SAY 50 DIFFERENT THINGS A DAY AND\nNONE OF THEM WOULD REALLY STICK. AND I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING\nTO THAT. I DO ALSO AGREE WITH JEFF,\nTHOUGH, THAT I THINK THAT HE GET, HE FEEDS OFF THESERALLY\nCROWDS, HE LIKES THE ENERGY, HE GETS INTO IT.\nAND THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT WALKING UP TO THE LINE AND\nCROSSING IT THAT HE HAS ALWAYS SEEMED TO GET SOMETHING OF A\nTHRILL FROM. THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT\nCIRCUMSTANCE. YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT POTENTIAL\nASSASSINATION OF A MAJOR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, AND THE\nSECRET SERVICE DIDN'T LIKE IT. >> IS THIS DONALD TRUMP\nOFF-TELEPROMPTER, OR DO YOU THINK THIS WAS A STRATEGY TO GET\nPEOPLE TO MOVE ON AND STOP TALKING ABOUT THE BIRTHER ISSUE?\n>> IT WAS CERTAINLY NOT ON TELEPROMPTERS.\nHE DIDN'T HAVE TELEPROMPTERS THERE.\nWE'VE SEEN HIM STICK TO TELEPROMPTERS WHEN HE WAS MAKING\nTHIS BIG COMEBACK IN THE NATIONAL\nPOLLS, HE WAS NOT SAYING THINGS LIKE THIS.\nTHE LAST TIME WE SAW IT WAS IN EARLY AUGUST WHEN HE WAS DOING\nBATTLE WITH HIS STAFF. IF THIS WAS A STRATEGIC\nCALCULATION TO SAY SOMETHING TO GET THE MEDIA'S ATTENTION, I'M\nNOT SURE THIS IS THE ANGLE HE WANTS PEOPLE TO FOCUS ON.\nHE HAD A BAD DAY, IT DIDN'T GO WELL, HIS STATEMENT WAS WEIRD\nABOUT HOW HE WAS RENOUNCING HIS BIRTHERISM.\nBUT I'M NOT SURE NOW, IF HE'S TALKING ABOUT, DOES HE WANT\nSOMEONE TO ASSASSINATE HILLARY CLINTON, I DON'T THINK THAT'S A\nBETTER CONVERSATION TO HAVE. >> BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE\nBIRTHER THING, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THESE LATEST COMMENTS?\n>> I ECHO THE COMMENTS OF JEFF, MAGGIE, AND PHILLIP, BUT THIS IS\nA REALLY SOPHOMORIC LINE OF REASONING, RIGHT?\nREASONABLE PEOPLE CAN DISAGREE ABOUT THE SECOND AMENDMENT AND\nGUN CONTROL. BUT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES, THE CANDIDATES, ARE RUNNING TO BE THE LEADER OF THE\nFREE WORLD. OUR SYSTEM ONLY WORKS WHEN THE\nPRESIDENT IS SAFE AND SECURE. IF DONALD TRUMP BECOMES\nPRESIDENT, HIS KIDS, HIS WIFE WILL HAVE SECRET SERVICE\nPROTECTION. HIS YOUNGEST KID WILL HAVE A\nSECRET SERVICE DETAIL FOLLOW HIM TO SCHOOL, AS IT SHOULD BE.\nBECAUSE WE DON'T -- REGARDLESS OF PARTY, YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE\nTO BE HURT. SO THIS IDEA THAT JUST BECAUSE\nTHERE'S A DISAGREEMENT ABOUT GUN CONTROL, THAT YOU CAN JUST THROW\nOFF THIS UP TO THE LINE OR OVER THE LINE REMARK ABOUT, OH, WELL,\nSEE IF SHE CAN TRY IT LIKE REGULAR PEOPLE, IT JUST IS -- IT\nDOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. >> ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON AND\nTALK ABOUT THE BIRTHER ISSUE TODAY.\nI WANT TO PLAY DONALD TRUMP'S STATEMENT TODAY.\nLISTEN. >> HILLARY CLINTON AND HER\nCAMPAIGN OF 2008 STARTED THE BIRTHER CONTROVERSY.\nI FINISHED IT. I FINISHED IT.\nYOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA WAS BORN\nIN THE UNITED STATES, PERIOD. NOW WE ALL WANT TO GET BACK TO\nMAKING AMERICA STRONG AND GREAT AGAIN.\n>> SO, JEFF, HE STARTED OFF THAT STATEMENT WITH SOMETHING THAT\nWAS FACTUALLY INACCURATE. AFTER FIVE YEARS OF SPREADING\nTHIS CONSPIRACY THEORY ABOUT THE PRESIDENT, HE GAVE A 30-SECOND\nSTATEMENT ADMITTING WHAT 70% OF AMERICANS ALREADY KNEW.\nIN POLITICAL CIRCLES, WHAT'S THE REACTION?\n>> WELL, THE REACTION HAS BEEN THAT, A, IT WAS CLEAR THAT HE\nDID NOT WANT TO BE GIVING THIS SORT OF ADMISSION TODAY.\nHE WAS DOING IT FOR ONE REASON. THE FACTS IN HIS ARGUMENT, HIS\nFLAWED ARGUMENT, WE SHOULD SAY, HAVE NOT CHANGED.\nBUT WHAT'S CHANGED IS, WE'RE 53 DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION, AND\nHIS ADVISERS HAVE TOLD HIM THAT HE NEEDS TO EXPAND, YOU KNOW,\nHIS APPEAL, AT LEAST, YOU KNOW, IN SOME CIRCLES HERE,\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS, PERHAPS OTHERS, TO WHITE SUBURBAN\nVOTERS. SO IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS DRAG\nTHERE HAD KICKING AND SCREAMING AFTER, YOU KNOW, TALKING TO \"THE\nWASHINGTON POST,\" JUST, YOU KNOW, TWO DAYS AGO, NOT\nACKNOWLEDGING THIS. THAT'S WHY HE HAD TO ACKNOWLEDGE\nIT. BUT LOOK, BY SAYING THAT THE\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN STARTED THIS, IT'S NOT TRUE.\nSHE DID NOT START THIS. YES, BACK IN 2007, ONE OF HER\nSTRATEGISTS HAD A MEMO OUT AT THE TIME, MARK PENN, SORT OF\nEXPLORING A LINE OF THINKING, THAT THEY COULD GO AFTER, SORT\nOF QUESTION THE ROOTS THAT OBAMA\nHAS.

SHE NEVER PURSUED THAT LINE OF\nARGUMENT. SO BY HIM ALSO SAYING THAT HE\nFINISHED IT, I DON'T SEE WHAT HE FINISHED.\nHAD HE FINISHED IT, HE WOULD HAVE COME TO THIS REALIZATION A\nLONG TIME AGO. NOT TODAY AT HIGH NOON AT HIS\nBRAND-NEW HOTEL IN DOWNTOWN WASHINGTON.\n>> YEAH, HE WOULD HAVE COME TO THE REALIZATION, ONE WOULD\nTHINK, AFTER THE PRESIDENT PRODUCED THIS HAS LONG FORM\nBIRTH CERTIFICATE IN 2011. YOU KNOW, SITTING AT HOME\nWATCHING IT, AS MOST PEOPLE DO, YOU KNOW, SITTING IN THEIR\nLIVING ROOMS, WHAT HAVE YOU, OR LISTENING TO IT ON THE RADIO, IT\nWAS NOT ONLY OFFENSIVE IN THAT, YOU KNOW, HOW HE TREATED THE\nPRESIDENT, BUT ALSO THAT HE USED THE VETERANS AS PROPS, THAT HE\nPROMOTED HIS HOTEL, MAGGIE, AND THAT HE GAVE 30 SECONDS TO AN\nISSUE THAT HE SORT OF CONNED THE PUBLIC INTO -- OR THE MEDIA INTO\nCOMING THERE FOR AND THE PUBLIC INTO THINKING THAT HE WAS GOING\nTO BE THERE FOR THAT ONE REASON. SO, DID HE PUT THIS BEHIND HIM\nOR DID HE MAKE IT EXPONENTIALLY WORSE WITH ALL OF THE\nSHENANIGANS TODAY? >> I THINK THE GOAL IN LARGE\nMEASURE WASN'T JUST ABOUT THE 53 REMAINING DAYS, IT WAS ABOUT THE\nFACT THAT IN TEN DAYS-ISH, THERE'S GOING TO BE THE DEBATE.\nAND I THINK HIS ADVISERS WANTED TO GET THIS DONE WITH.\nBUT THIS DIDN'T END IT BY ANY STRETCH.\nTHERE ARE FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS, DO YOU FEEL SORRY ABOUT IT?\nDO YOU REGRET IT, ARE YOU GOING TO APOLOGIZE TO THE PRESIDENT?\nNONE OF THAT HAS BEEN RESOLVED. IN TERMS FTD EVENT ITSELF,\nTHE VETERANS WHO WERE THERE IN SUPPORT OF HIM, THESE MILITARY\nFIGURES, THEY'RE MAKING A CHOICE, AND I DON'T WANT TO\nDENIGRATE THEIR POLITICAL CHOICE.\nBUT I THINK IT RAISES QUESTIONS TO DO AN EVENT THE WAY THEY DID\nIT, WHEN HE WAS SURROUNDED IN THIS WAY AND TACKED ON AT THE\nVERY END. >> WITH A GENERAL WHO WAS A\nBIRTHER. >> YES.\nAND THEN HE TOOK ALL OF THE -- OR SOME OF THE CAMERAS ON A TOUR\nOF HIS HOTEL AND BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT WAS DONE, AND THIS WAS A\nFIRST, THE BROADCAST POOL ERASED THE TAPE.\nAND SAID THEY WERE NOT GOING TO AIR THIS, BECAUSE THERE WAS A\nBAR ON EDITORIAL REPORTERS COMING ALONG.\nIT WAS JUST CAMERAS. SO THERE IS A BIT OF A\nDIFFERENCE IN TODAY WHAT WE HAVE SEEN.\nI THINK THAT THIS IS THE SECOND TIME THIS WEEK WHERE TRUMP HAS\nUSED SOMETHING TO GIN UP EXCITEMENT.\nHE EVEN SAID THIS MORNING, ON A CNBC INTERVIEW, THAT HE NEEDED\nTO KEEP THE SUSPENSE GOING ABOUT WHAT HE WAS GOING TO SAY.\n>> ABOUT DR. OZ AND THE HEALTH REPORT.\n>> CORRECT. AND THIS MORNING IN TERMS OF THE\nBIRTHER ISSUE, HE SUGGESTED HE WASN'T GOING TO ANSWER IT RIGHT\nAWAY BECAUSE WE HAVE TO KEEP THE SUSPENSE GOING, SO I'M NOT GOING\nTO ANSWER IT HERE. WHICH SUGGESTS THAT HE'S\nTREATING IT LIKE A GAME. WHICH, SOME VOTERS ARE FINE WITH\nTHAT, SOME ARE NOT FINE WITH THAT, BUT IT'S A RISK THIS CLOSE\nTO THE ELECTION. >> AND ALSO THEY'RE TALKING\nABOUT, HE HAS BEEN SO CRITICAL OF THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION AND THE TWO MIXING. AND THERE HAVE BEEN QUESTIONS,\nWE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IT, BECAUSE HE SORT OF CHANGED THE SUBJECT\nWITH THE HEALTH THING WITH DR. OZ, THAT CAME OUT IN \"NEWSWEEK\"\nABOUT HIS BUSINESS HANDLINGS, HIS BUSINESS DEALINGS, AND HOW\nMAYBE THE CAMPAIGN AND HIS BUSINESSES ARE -- HE DIDN'T HELP\nTHAT TODAY BY GIVING PEOPLE A TOUR AND PROMOTING HIS\nBUSINESSES ON NATIONAL TELEVISION, HIS HOTEL.\n>> HE DIDN'T HELP HIS CAMPAIGN, NO.\nI ASSUME HE HELPED THE TRUMP HOTEL THAT'S GOING TO BE OPEN TO\nTHE PUBLIC SOON. THERE ARE SO MANY QUESTIONS\nABOUT TODAY'S EVENT THAT IT'S SORT OF HARD TO PARSE THEM JUST\nSITTING HERE. BUT, YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.\nONE OF THE THINGS, DAVID GERGEN MADE A GREAT COMMENT A COUPLE OF\nDAYS AGO, THAT DONALD TRUMP IS NOT A PUBLIC SERVANT.\nUSUALLY WE HAVE ELECTED OFFICIALS THAT ARE PUBLIC\nSERVANTS. WE CAN LOOK AT PUBLIC SERVICE\nRECORD AND EVALUATE THEM. DONALD TRUMP'S A BUSINESS MAN.\nIT IS VERY HARD FOR US TO KNOW HOW HE'S APPROACHING THIS THING,\nBESIDES THESE LITTLE HINTS THAT HE GIVES, THAT TREATS IT LIKE A\nREALITY TV SHOW, THAT TREATS IT LIKE AN ADD FOR HIS TOTALS.\n-- HOLTS. AT THE SAME TIME, HE GIVES THIS\nSTATEMENT THAT DOES NO POLITICAL GOOD.\nHE SAYS -- HE DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT WHY HE DID THIS\nTHING HAS MADE SO MANY PEOPLE UPSET.\nAND WITHOUT SAYING WHY HE DID IT, NOBODY IS GOING TO SAY,\nOKAY, IT'S FINE HE DID IT, THEN. >> DAVID, WHY ARE PEOPLE FALLING\nFOR THE OLD OKEY-DOKE. WHAT'S GOING ON?\nWHAT DOES THIS SAY ABOUT US? >> I'M NOT SURE PEOPLE ARE\nFALLING FOR THE OKEY-DOKE. I THINK PHILLIP'S RIGHT.\nTHE WAY DONALD TRUMP CAME OUT TODAY AND PHRASED HIS ANSWER, IT\nDOESN'T CLOSE THE DOOR ON THIS. AT THE FIRST DEBATE A WEEK AND A\nHALF FROM NOW, YOU KNOW, I DON'T SEE HOW A QUESTION CANNOT BE\nASKED, SO, IF IT'S JUST THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA IS A U.S.\nCITIZEN, PERIOD, AS DONALD TRUMP SAID, THEN, WHAT WERE THE LAST\nFIVE YEARS ALL ABOUT? I MEAN, IF YOU LOOKED AT TRUMP'S\nDEMEANOR TODAY, DON, HE LOOKED LIKE SOMEONE WHO WAS FORCED TO\nDO SOMETHING THAT HE REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO DO.\nTHIS WAS A SOURCE OF TREMENDOUS HUMILIATION FOR HIM, BACK IN\n2011, AND YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK THIS IS GOING TO SHUT THE\nDOOR ON HIM. HAVE PEOPLE FALLEN FOR IT?\nI THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT BAKED INTO THE CAKE, IF YOU DON'T LIKE\nPRESIDENT OBAMA, YOU'RE INCLINED TO BRUSH THIS OFF.\nIF YOU'RE SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T LIKE DONALD TRUMP, YOU'RE\nINCLINED TO SAY, WELL, SEE, THAT'S WHY PEOPLE DON'T LIKE\nDONALD TRUMP. I DON'T THINK IT'S A GAME\nCHANGER, BUT I DO THINK IT MAKES IT A LITTLE HARDER FOR TRUMP TO\nGET THE NEWS CYCLE BACK IN HIS FAVOR.\n>> WELL, I ALSO THINK IT'S JUST FOR DECENT PEOPLE WHO HAVE SOME\nSENSE ABOUT THEM THAT THEY ARE OFFENDED BY THE REMARKS TODAY.\nAND YOU'RE RIGHT, IT'S THERE KIND OF LIKE, THERE, MAMA, I ATE\nTHE SPINACH, ARE YOU HAPPY NOW, THE WAY THE WORDS CAME OUT OF\nHIS MOUTH. BUT I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO\nHILLARY CLINTON'S RESPONSE. >> HIS CAMPAIGN WAS FOUNDED ON\nTHIS OUTRAGEOUS LIE. THERE IS NO ERASING IT IN\nHISTORY. HE IS FEEDING INTO THE WORST\nIMPULSES, THE BIGOTRY AND BIAS THAT LURKS IN OUR COUNTRY.\n>> SO, HOW IS THIS GOING TO PLAY WITH VOTERS, JEFF?\nHOW DO YOU THINK? >> WELL, I THINK FOR, YOU KNOW,\nDONALD TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS, THEY WILL EITHER BE WITH HIM OR BLAME\nTHE MEDIA FOR, YOU KNOW, TALKING ABOUT THIS.\nBUT I THINK FOR THE VOTERS THAT SECRETARY CLINTON IS AFTER, WE\nTALK ABOUT THE SUPPORTERS OF THE PRESIDENT, THE OBAMA COALITION.\nSHE'S BEEN HAVING SOME TROUBLE SORT OF INSPIRING THEM AND\nRALLYING THE OBAMA COALITION. DONALD TRUMP DID THAT FOR HER\nTODAY. HE DID A LOT OF -- IN THAT\nMOMENT, AND YOU CAN BET THAT 32 SECONDS IS GOING TO BE REPLAYED\nIN SOME TYPE OF ADVERTISEMENT, HER SUPER PAC, OR THE SUPER PAC\nTHAT'S SUPPORTING HER IS ALREADY ADVERTISING TO AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nVOTERS ABOUT THIS ISSUE. I THINK THAT PEOPLE WHO, LIKE,\nMAYBE HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT THIS OR THOUGHT, OH, SURELY HE MUST\nHAVE DROPPED THIS BY NOW, WILL BE REMINDED THAT HE, YOU KNOW,\nDID THIS IN THIS WAY HERE. SO I THINK IT THE FIRED UP\nDEMOCRATS. IT FIRED UP AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nLEADERS. IT'S ALSO HAPPENING IN THE SAME\nWEEKEND OF A BIG MEETING HERE IN WASHINGTON.\nTOMORROW NIGHT ON THE SAME STAGE, THE PRESIDENT AND THE\nSECRETARY ARE GOING TO BE TALKING TO THE CONGRESSIONAL\nBLACK CAUCUS, WHICH HAS AFRICAN-AMERICAN LEADERS FROM\nACROSS THE COUNTRY. OF COURSE THEY WILL BE TALKING\nABOUT THIS, AND THAT'S SIMPLY, PEOPLE TAKE THIS BACK TO THEIR\nCOMMUNITIES. I THINK THIS FIRES UP\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS. YOUNG VOTERS, OTHER VOTERS, AND\nIT'S NOT GOOD FOR DONALD TRUMP, POLITICALLY.\n>> AND WE'LL HAVE SPECIAL LIVE COVERAGE OF THAT EVENT FORM\nNIGHT WHEN THE PRESIDENT SPEAKS AND ALSO HILLARY CLINTON, AND\nI'LL BE ANCHORING THAT COVERAGE 8:00 TO 10:00 HERE ON CNN.\nI WANT TO PLAY THIS. THIS IS A CLIP FROM THE FIRST\nLADY TODAY, MICHELLE OBAMA. >> SO IF A CANDIDATE IS ERRATIC\nAND THREATENING, IF A CANDIDATE TRAFFICS IN PREJUDICE, FEARS,\nAND LIES ON THE TRAIL, IF A CANDIDATE HAS NO CLEAR PLANS TO\nIMPLEMENT THEIR GOALS, IF THEY DISRESPECT THEIR FELLOW\nCITIZENS, INCLUDING FOLKS WHO MAKE EXTRAORDINARY SACRIFICES\nFOR OUR COUNTRY, LET ME TELL YOU, THAT IS WHO THEY ARE.\nTHAT IS THE KIND OF PRESIDENT THEY WILL BE.\nTRUST ME. >> I'M WONDERING IF THIS EPISODE\nREINFORCES HILLARY CLINTON'S ARGUMENT THAT TRUMP DOESN'T HAVE\nTEMPERAMENT TO BE PRESIDENT, AND ALSO, IF THIS SORT OF, YOU KNOW,\nIN SOME WAYS, TAMPS DOWN THE CRITICISM THAT SHE'S GOTTEN\nABOUT THE DEPLORABLES COMMENT. >> WELL, WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT\nTHE DEPLORABLES COMMENT. GRANTED, IT'S BEEN A WEEK.\nBUT IT'S ONLY COME UP BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP MENTIONED IT\nEARLIER. I THINK THAT THIS DOES A LOT OF\nTHINGS FOR HILLARY CLINTON THAT ARE BENEFICIAL.\nTO YOUR POINT ABOUT TEMPERAMENT, YES, HIM STANDING UP THERE AND\nHIS RESPONSE TO IT, WHICH WAS, OBVIOUSLY PETULAST NIGHT.\nDOES DO ANYTHING TO MAKE ANYBODY FEEL HE ISN'T MONEY REACTING OUT\nOF EMOTION. THE NUMBER ONE CONCERN THAT\nPEOPLE HAVE ABOUT HIM IS HIS TEMPERAMENT.\nBUT SECONDARILY, WE SHOULD KEEP IN MIND, THIS IS ALSO A FIGHT\nABOUT WHITE REPUBLICANS. AND HILLARY CLINTON HAS DONE A\nLOT OF WORK TO TRY TO TELL WHITE REPUBLICANS THAT IT'S OKAY TO\nSTEP AWAY FROM THE PARTY FOR THIS ELECTION CYCLE.\nWE'VE SEEN IN \"WASHINGTON POST\" A FIF FIFTH OF REPUBLICAN MEN\nAND A QUARTER OF REPUBLICAN WOMEN THINK THAT DONALD\nTRUMP HAS AN ISSUE WITH RACISM OR SEXISM.\nIT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY HIS NUMBERS ARE LOWER WITH\nREPUBLICANS THAN THEY COULD BE. AND HILLARY CLINTON NOW GETS TO\nUSE THIS TO REINFORCE, LOOK, THIS IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.\n>> IT WAS A GIFT TO HILLARY CLINTON TODAY FROM DONALD TRUMP.\nTHANK YOU, ALL. I APPRECIATE IT.\nCOMING UP, DONALD TRUMP IS TRYING TO THE BIRTHER ISSUE\nBEHIND HIM, YET STILL BLAMING IT",

WATCH THIS AD THAT JUST DROPPED\nA FEW MOMENTS AGO. \u00e2\u0099\u00aa\n>> HILLARY CLINTON AND HER CAMPAIGN OF 2008 STARTED THE\nBIRTHER CONTROVERSY. \u00e2\u0099\u00aa\n>> DID HILLARY CLINTON QUESTION THE LEGIT MASY OF BARACK OBAMA'S\nBIRTH CERTIFICATE? NO.\n>> I FINISHED IT. >> ALL RIGHTY.\nTHIS HAS TRUMP COURTS CONTROVERSY AGAIN TELLING HIS\nSUPPORTERS LAST NIGHT HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO TAKE AWAY THE\nSECOND AMENDMENT AND CALLING FOR HER SECRET SERVICE DETAIL TO\nDISARM. JUST FOR THE RECORD, SHE HAS\nNEVER SAID SHE WANTS TO ABOLISH THE SECOND AMENDMENT.\n>> HILLARY CLINTON IS BACK ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\nTHEY WILL SPEAK AT THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS\nDINNER IN WASHINGTON. THEY ARE EXPRESSING THEIR\nOUTRAGE AFTER DONALD TRUMP'S 32-WORD DEALING WITH THE BIRTHER\nCONTROVERSY. I WANT TO BRING IN ANGELA CNN\nPOLITICAL COMMENTATOR AND FORMER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE BLACK\nCAUCUS. ANGELA, GOOD MORNING.\n>> GOOD MORNING, VICTOR. >> SO LET'S START WITH THIS\nBIRTHERISM TREATMENT FROM DONALD TRUMP.\nWE KNOW THAT UNTIL HIS STATEMENT OR BEFORE HIS STATEMENT\nYESTERDAY THE LINGERING QUESTION OUT THERE IS IF DONALD TRUMP\nWOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HE WAS WRONG AND HOW THAT COULD IMPACT\nHIM WITH VOTERS WHO WERE NOT HAPPY WITH HIS BIRTHERISM\nCLAIMS. NOW THAT HE'S DEALT WITH IT, IT\nSEEMS HE'S MADE THE PROBLEM FOR HIMSELF EVEN WORSE.\n>> YEAH. I THINK IT'S SO INTERESTING THAT\nYOU SAID NOW THAT HE'S DEALT WITH IT, RIGHT?\nDEALT WITH IT IS AN INTERESTING WAY OF PHRASING IT BECAUSE I\nDON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT HE DID AT ALL.\nI THINK, IN FACT, HE ADDED FUEL TO THE FIRE.\nDONALD TRUMP CAN'T EVEN APOLOGIZE FOR IT, VICTOR.\nA FEW DAYS AGO -- OR A COUPLE DAYS AGO AS SOON AS THIS\nANNOUNCEMENT WAS BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION, I WAS LIKE, WELL,\nDONALD TRUMP GOES TO TWITTER FOR EVERYTHING ELSE.\nHE SHOULD GO TO TWITTER TO APOLOGIZE TO OUR FIRST BLACK\nPRESIDENT FOR OTHERISM. THERE'S ALL THESISMS, RIGHT?\nTHE WHOLE REASON THAT BIRTHERISM CAME INTO PLAY AND HAD ANY\nTRACTION AT ALL WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP OR\nWHOMEVER ELSE, WHETHER IT'S BREITBART OR DAILY CALLER OR\nWHOMEVER ELSE, THIS ALL CAME ABOUT BECAUSE PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE\nTHE FACT THAT HE WAS DIFFERENT. IT TOOK 44 PRESIDENTS TO GET ONE\nBARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA. THEY USED TO MAKE FUN OF THE\nFACT THAT HIS MIDDLE NAME WAS HUSSEIN.\nTHEY SAID HE WAS MUSLIM, SOCIALIST.\nDONALD TRUMP DIDN'T JUST GO INTO THIS BIRTHERISM SPACE, HE ALSO\nCHALLENGED PRESIDENT OBAMA'S TRANSCRIPTS AT HARVARD, VICTOR,\nOTHERISM IS THE REAL PROBLEM. THAT'S RACISM.\n>> LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON AND SPEAKING BEFORE THE\nCBC TONIGHT. OF COURSE THE KEY I THINK HER\nPEOPLE HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED AND ANYONE WHO IS WATCHING FROM THE\nOUTSIDE THAT THE KEY TO WINNING IS KEEPING TOGETHER THE OBAMA\nCOALITION. THE POLLS SHOW THAT SHE IS DOING\nWELL AS IT RELATES TO A PERCENTAGE BUT STILL HAS SOME\nGROUND TO MAKE UP AS IT RELATES TO THE ENTHUSIASM WE SAW WITH\nMANY OF THE GROUPS IN 2008 AND 2012.\nHOW DOES SHE, I GUESS, KEEP OR REGAIN OR RENEW THAT ENTHUSIASM\nAND HOW CAN SHE START THAT -- OR CONTINUE IT TONIGHT?\n>> SO JUST A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT.\nCONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS FOUNDATION IS A 501-3-C\nORGANIZATION. SHE WILL BE SPEAKING TONIGHT AS\nHER ACCEPTING AN AWARD. THAT AWARD IS THE INAUGURAL\nTRAIL BLAZER AWARD THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS\nFOUNDATION IS AWARDING HER FOR THAT FOR OF COURSE BECOMING THE\nFIRST NOMINEE OF A MAJOR PARTY, WHO IS A WOMAN, ON THIS -- IN\nTHIS CRITICAL ELECTION. SO SHE WILL MAKE REMARKS IN\nRESPONSE TO RECEIVING THAT AWARD.\nOF COURSE, BARACK OBAMA WILL ALSO BE SPEAKING TONIGHT.\nSO, THAT MAY OVERSHADOW HER JUST A BIT.\nI THINK TONIGHT WE'LL HEAR MORE OF THE SAME FROM HILLARY\nCLINTON. SHE'S BEEN VERY CONSISTENT THIS\nELECTION SEASON. SHE'S BEEN VERY CLEAR IN HER\nPRAISE OF BLACK WOMEN, OF BLACK MEN.\nYOU HEARD HER EARLIER THIS WEEK TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANT ROLE\nTHAT BLACK WOMEN HAVE PLAYED IN HISTORY AND MAKING BLACK GIRL\nMAGIC HAPPEN. SHE COINED -- SHE USED THE\nHASHTAG THIS WEEK WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT TO SO MANY OF US.\nSO I THINK YOU'LL HEAR HER OUT THE THE PRESIDENT -- THE\nPRESIDENT'S RECORD AND HOW SHE PLANS TO BUILD ON THAT.\nI KNOW THAT MY REPUBLICAN COUNTERPARTS OFTEN CALL IT A\nTHIRD TERM FOR OBAMA, BUT I THINK SHE'LL TALK ABOUT BUILDING\nON HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS WELL. >> OKAY.\nTHAT FROM YOUR HISTORY AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THAT\nORGANIZATION, NOW LET ME BRING YOU TO CNN --\n>> NO, I WAS THE OFFICIAL CMO, NOT THE FOUNDATION.\n>> BLACK CAUCUS AND FOUNDATION. >> CONFUSING IT.\n>> THEY'RE SPEAKING IN THEIR ROLES AS MEMBERS OF THE PAC\nYESTERDAY. >> YES.\n>> THESE ARE DIFFERENT VIEWS. >> THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT.\n>> KEEPING THEM STRAIGHT. LET ME NOW GET YOUR THOUGHT ON\nWHAT WE HEARD FROM DONALD TRUMP YESTERDAY IN MIAMI AS IT RELATES\nTO THE RELATIONS WITH CUBA. IT SEEMS THAT THERE WAS A BACK\nFLIP HERE. LET'S LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID\nSEVERAL MONTHS AGO AND THEN WHAT HE SAID LAST NIGHT.\n>> SURE. >> WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE\nOPENING WITH CUBA? DO YOU THINK THAT WAS A GOOD\nPOLICY? OR DO YOU OPPOSE AMERICA'S\nOPENING WITH CUBA? >> I THINK IT'S FINE.\nI THINK IT'S FINE BUT WE SHOULD HAVE MADE A BETTER DEAL.\nTHE CONCEPT OF OPENING WITH CUBA 50 YEARS IS ENOUGH.\nTHE CONCEPT OF OPENING WITH CUBA IS FINE.\nI THINK WE SHOULD HAVE MADE A STRONGER DEAL.\nBUT ALL OF THE CONCESSIONS BARACK OBAMA HAS GRANTED THE\nCASTRO REGIME WERE DONE THROUGH EXECUTIVE ORDER, WHICH MEANS THE\nNEXT PRESIDENT CAN REVERSE THEM AND THAT I WILL DO UNLESS THE\nCASTRO REGIME MEETS OUR DEMANDS. >> SUGGESTING NOW THAT HE WOULD\nREVERSE THIS OPENING. AS HILLARY CLINTON TRIES TO KEEP\nTHE COALITION TOGETHER WITH LATINO VOTERS IN SOUTH FLORIDA,\nHOW IMPORTANT COULD THIS APPEAR OF A FLIP-FLOP TO BE?\n>> VICTOR, I WISH THAT FLIP-FLOPS MATTERED FOR DONALD\nTRUMP THIS ELECTION. BUT WE'VE SEEN TIME AND TIME\nAGAIN, HE CAN BACK FLIP, HE CAN FRONT FLIP, HE CAN, YOU KNOW, DO\nA WATER SLIDE -- HE CAN DO SO MUCH THAT I'VE NEVER SEEN\nANYTHING LIKE THIS. FACTS DON'T MATTER TO HIM AND I\nTHINK PART OF IT -- THIS IS A KEY EXAMPLE.\nYOU SEE HIM IN ONE OF THE CLIPS THAT YOU SHOWED READING FROM A\nPROMPTER. THOSE ARE SOMEONE ELSE'S WORDS\nTHAT SOMEONE ELSE'S KNOWLEDGE. THAT'S NOT IN DONALD TRUMP'S OWN\nMIND OR HEAD. THOSE ARE WORDS FROM HIS\nADVISERS ON THIS CALL HE IS PROBABLY JUST SPEAKING OFF THE\nCUFF, JUST LIKE YOU HEARD HIM SPEAK ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON\nYESTERDAY AND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF SHE DIDN'T HAVE GUARDS, WHICH\nARE REALLY MEMBERS OF THE SECRET SERVICE.\nSO THIS MAN DOES NOT HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH FACTS.\nI'VE SAID HE HAD A TREACHEROUS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE TRUTH AND\nUNFORTUNATELY IT HASN'T MOVED THE NEEDLE WITH HIS SUPPORTERS.\n>> CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR ANGELA RYE, FORMER DIRECTOR OF\nTHE BLACK CAUCUS. HILLARY CLINTON WILL RECEIVE AN\nAWARD TONIGHT FROM THE FOUNDATION AND WE HEARD FROM THE\nREPRESENTATIVES YESTERDAY IN THEIR ROLES AS MEMBERS OF THE\nPAC. WE GOT IT ALL STRAIGHT THERE.\n>> THANK YOU, VICTOR. >> ANG LARKS THANKS SO MUCH.\n>> YOU'RE GOOD.",

IT MAKES A POINT, IT'S FILLED\nWITH COLUMNS AND WORK OF YOURS ONLY ABOUT THESE TWO.\nTHAT'S HOW MUCH YOU'VE WRITTEN ABOUT CLINTON, THE CLINTONS, AND\nDONALD TRUMP. >> YES.\nBUT IT ALSO HAS A LONG ESSAY ABOUT THE BUSH FAMILY, WHOM I'VE\nCOVERED FOR 30 YEARS.

I HAVE CONFRONTED HIM WITH MANY\nDIFFERENT THINGS THAT SEEMED WRONG TO ME, FOR INSTANCE, I\nASKED HIM -- I TOLD HIM THAT IT WAS WRONG THAT THERE WAS\nVIOLENCE BEING INCITED AT HIS RALLIES AND THAT REPORTERS WERE\nGETTING ROUGHED UP. HE PAUSED, YOUR RIGHT, HE DID\nLISTEN, THEN HE DISAGREED. HE SAID HE THOUGHT THE VIOLENCE\nADDED EXCITEMENT. AND I SAID, HOW CAN YOU\nCRITICIZE BILL CLINTON FOR INFIDELITIES, YOU'RE MAKING THAT\nPART OF THE CAMPAIGN AND MAYBE IN THE UPCOMING DEBATES WHEN YOU\nHAD ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS INFIDELITY SCANDALS IN NEW YORK\nHISTORY, THE MARLA MAPLES BEST SEX I'VE EVER HAD NEW YORK POST\nHEADLINE. AND HE SAID, WELL, I WASN'T THE\nPRESIDENT. SO, HE ALWAYS HAS SOME GLIB\nANSWER. HE DID LIST -- NOT LISTEN TO ME\nBUT LISTEN TO MY SISTER WHO HAS AN ESSAY IN THE BOOK.\nSHE IS LIKE YOU, SOMETIMES SHE'S A REPUBLICAN AND SOMETIMES SHE'S\nNOT. BUT I TOLD HIM -- HE SAID IS\nYOUR STILL STILL VOTING FOR ME.

I'M NOT ADVISING HIM.\nI'M JUST STATING WHAT IS UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR.\n>> YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR SISTER. YOU ALSO TALK AND HE WRITES YOUR\nBROTHER KEVIN.

THE GOP ANGST, THE GNASHING AND\nWAILING AND SEARCHING FOR LAST-MINUTE SUBSTITUTES AND EXIT\nSTRATEGIES IS GETTING OLD.

HE DIDN'T CALL TRUMP BRILLIANT.\nHE CALLED HIM FLASHY. SO THIS WHOLE CRAZY BROMANCE\nWITH PUTIN MAY BE BASED ON A MISTRANM\nMISTRANSLATION. HE WAS A NEW YORK DEMOCRAT, SO\nWE HAVE THESE KIND OF TWO NEW YORK DEMOCRATS RUNNING AGAINST\nEACH OTHER, BUT IN MANY WAYS HILLARY IS, YOU KNOW -- SHE IS\nIN TO MUSCULAR INTERVENTION, SHE IS A HOG, SHE\n>> THIS WAS NOT A DEATHBED SCENARIO.\nI THINK IT WAS A KITCHEN TABLE, BUT THE POINT YOU DROVE HOME WAS\nTHAT BEAU WANTED HIS DAD TO RUN.

WELL, HE HAS SAID HIMSELF HE\nTHINKS ABOUT IT EVERYDAY AND IF I WERE JOE BIDEN I WOULD BE\nREALLY ANGRY BECAUSE HE WOULD BE WALKING STRAIGHT INTO THE WHITE\nHOUSE AND THAT'S USUALLY THE VICE PRESIDENT HAS THE RIGHT OF\nFIRST REFUSAL, YOU KNOW. BUT THEY THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD\nSHOOT OFF HIS MOUTH AND HAVE A LOT OF GAS, BUT IN THE EAR OF\nTRUMP, THAT -- HIS GAFFES WOULD SEEM LIKE NOTHING.\nAND THERE WAS SOME DEMOCRATS THE OTHER DAY WHEN HILLARY HAD HER\nHEALTH SCARE WHO WE'RE SAYING MAYBE SHE -- IF IT GOT WORSE,\nMAYBE SHE WOULD HAVE TO STEP ASIDE FOR BIDEN WHICH WOULD BE\nIRONIC SINCE THEY PUSHED BIDEN OUT FOR HILLARY.\n>> THE YEAR OF VOTING DANGEROUSLY, AS I LIKE TO SAY,\nMAUREEN, I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT IN MY LIFE AND\nI HOPE I NEVER DO AGAIN.

THEN IT HAD COME OUT AND\nPUBLISHED THEM. WOULDN'T THERE BE AT LEAST\nOUTRAGE, AT LEAST HAND RINGING, AT LEAST THINKING OUT LOUD\nSHOULD WE BE PUBLISHING THIS? IN THIS CASE, THERE WAS NONE OF\nTHAT. MY ONLY POINT WAS AT LEAST LET'S\nINCORPORATE THAT INTO OUR THINKING AND I LAID OUT IN THAT\nPIECE WHY I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT WHILE I WAS\nINCREDIBLY SORRY ABOUT THIS, IN THE END, I HAD TO GO AHEAD AND\nPUBLISH THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE NEWS.\n>> HEY, DAN, I HAVE AN OLDER BROTHER, GROWING UP LIKE\nBROTHERS WE WOULD FIGHT.

WE HAVE HILLARY AND WE HAVE\nTRUMP AND IT'S PARTISAN. BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE\nRUSSIANS HERE. WHY AREN'T WE UNITED AGAINST A\nCOMMON ENEMY? >> I THINK TWO REASONS.\nFIRST OF ALL, THERE'S NOT 100% CERTAINTY IT'S THE RUSSIANS AND\nMOST IMPORTANTLY I THINK THE GOSSIP IS JUST TOO JUICY THAT WE\nJUST CAN'T RESIST IT. THAT, OH MY GOODnd, COLIN\nPOWELL, THE SAR MOANS YOU POWELL WHO SORT OF RARELY GIVES HIS\nUNVARNISHED OPINIONS ABOUT POLITICS, GIVING -- OFFERING UP\nJUICY GOSSIP AND ANALYSIS OF THIS POLITICAL CAMPAIGN, I THINK\nIT WAS JUST TOO MUCH. EVEN BEYOND THAT THINK ABOUT IT,\nTHIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME THE SONY HACK THAT OCCURRED IN 2014,\nTHERE WAS VERY LITTLE SENSE OF, BOY, THIS IS WRONG.\nIT WAS ALL ABOUT WHAT DID THESE SONY EXECUTIVES SAY THAT WAS BAD\nAND WRONG AND THERE WERE HEADS THAT WERE GOING TO FLY, ET\nCETERA. INSTEAD OF SAYING, WAIT A SEC,\nWHY AREN'T WE MAKING ANY JUDGMENTS AT ALL ABOUT THE HACK,\nIN PARTICULAR IN THIS CASE, WHERE YOU'RE POTENTIALLY TALKING\nABOUT NOT JUST THE RUSSIANS HACKING, BUT POTENTIALLY THE\nRUSSIANS HACKING TOO TRY TO INFLUENCE THE ELECTION.\nI MEAN, WHY -- WHERE IS THE OUTRAGE ON THAT?\n>> YOU PREVIOUSLY BROKE DOWN FOR US A LEGAL ANALYSIS OF HILLARY\nCLINTON'S ACTIONS RELATIVE TO HER PRIVATE E-MAIL AND PRIVATE\nE-MAIL SERVERS. IT WAS A GREAT SOBER ANALYSIS.\nI WANT TO ASK YOU A STREET SMART QUESTION.\nIF, IN FACT, MAY BE THE RUSSIANS, WE DON'T KNOW, YOU'RE\nRIGHT, BUT SOMEBODY HACKED COLIN POWELL, A FORMER SECRETARY OF\nSTATE, DOESN'T THAT INCREASE IN YOUR MIND THE LIKELIHOOD THAT\nHILLARY OPERATING MULTIPLE DEVICES, HER OWN DOMAIN, AND\nPRIVATE SERVERS, PROBABLY WAS THE VICTIM OF SUCH A HACK AS\nWELL AND MAYBE WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT IN THE NEXT 55 DAYS?\n>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT PROBABLY. I CERTAINLY THINK IT MAKES IT\nCLEAR THAT IT COULD HAVE HAPPENED, RIGHT?\nI'M NOT GOING TO SIT HERE AND SAY, OH, WELL THIS MEANS\nTHEREFORE HILLARY WAS HACKED. IT CERTAINLY MEANS THAT HILLARY\nCOULD HAVE BEEN HACKED. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S BEEN\nAGREED TO AND I DON'T THINK THAT -- AS YOU AND I HAVE TALKED\nABOUT, THAT THAT RELATES TO THE LEGAL ANALYSIS ON THE HILLARY\nCLINTON CASE. BUT, THERE IS REAL CONCERN, I\nTHINK, ON EVERYONE'S PART NOW THAT WE ALL CAN BE HACKED.\nAND AS A RESULT, YOU KNOW, YOU SEE PEOPLE NOW ENCRYPTING THEIR\nE-MAILS AND MAKING GREATER EFFORTS.\nTHAT'S FINE. BUT AGAIN THAT SEEMS TO ME TO\nSHIFT THE ISSUE AWAY FROM POINTING THE FINGER OF BLAME AT\nWHO DID THIS AND THEN HAVING A LITTLE SOUL SEARCHING ON OUR\nPART. IN PARTICULAR ON THE MEDIA'S\nPART TO SAY, HUH, SHOULDN'T WE BE THINKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT\nWHY WE'RE PUBLISHING THIS? ARE THERE CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE\nPOWELL E-MAILS MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T HAVE PUBLISHED?\nMAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE JUST PUBLISHED THE ONES THAT RELATED\nTO SPECIFIC THOUGHTS ON THE ELECTIONS AND NOT MAYBE SOME OF\nTHE MORE SALACIOUS ONES. SHOULD WE IN THE MEDIA HAVE\nOFFERED HIM ANY PRIVACY KNOWING WHAT THE SOURCE OF THIS\nINFORMATION WAS? IT'S A TOUGH QUESTION.\nI THINK THE ANSWER IS THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF WHAT WAS IN\nTHERE CAN BE CONSIDERED NEWS AND THAT'S THE REASON I DIDN'T BAN\nIT AND I ADMIT IT. YOU KNOW, I'M SORT OF LAYING ALL\nOF IT OUT THERE FOR THE PUBLIC TO JUDGE ME BY SAYING LOOK, I\nDIDN'T HAVE THE FORTITUDE TO DO IT.\nI'M COMPETING WITH MY WEBSITES AGAINST THE POLITICOS AND DAILY\nBEASTS OF WORLD THAT DO DOUBLE MY TRAFFIC AND AS A RESULT I'M\nADMITTING THAT'S COMING INTO MY THINKING.\nYOU CAN ARGUE THAT'S HORRIBLE, DAN ABRAMS, THAT THAT'S THE WAY\nYOU'RE MAKING THE DECISION AND I'M JUST LAYING IT OUT THERE FOR\nTHE READERS AND VIEWERS TO DECIDE THAT AT LEAST I'M\nADMITTING IT, AT LEAST I'M THINKING ABOUT, AND AT LEAST I'M\nTALKING ABOUT IT. >> I THINK IT'S A HEALTHY\nCONVERSATION.

THE COURT SUPPOSED WHEN THE SEE\nBILL CLINTON THE FIRST THING YOU THINK OF IS NOT HILARY, IT'S\nFORMER PRESIDENT AND YESTERDAY. HE CAN GO AND RAISE MONEY BUT IN\nTERMS OF WHAT SHE IS GOING TO DO AS PRESIDENT, SHE NEEDS TO BE\nMAKING THAT CASE. MEANTIME, THE AUTHOR, PEGGY\nNOONAN PENNED AN OPED AND OPINIONS OUT HOW LOW\nTRUSTWORTHYINGS IN NUMBERS HAVE PLAGUED HILLARY CLINTON SINCE\nTHE BEGINNING OF HER PUBLIC LIFE.\nAARON IS A POLITICAL POLITICS -- NATIONAL POLITICS EDITOR FOR THE\n\"WALL STREET JOURNAL.\" WHERE TOO YOU SEE THIS THING IN\nTHE ARC? I DON'T THINK THE ARTICLE WAS\nSUGGESTING BILL CLINTON IS TERRIBLE AT IT, JUST HE IS A\nREMINDER OF PREVIOUS THINGS AND SHE WANTS TO BE LOOKING FORWARD.\n>> ISEE TWO THINGS GOING ON. ONE ABOUT BILL CLINTON HIMSELF\nAND THE OTHER ABOUT THE MOMENT WE WERE IN.\nONLY FOUR YEARS AGO BILL CLINTON WAS A BIG ASSET TO THE\nDEMOCRATIC PARTY. THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL\nCONVENTION. THE DEMOCRATS LOVED HIS SPEECH,\nTAKING APART MITT ROMNEY, PRESIDENT OBAMA, CALLING HIM THE\nSECRETARY OF EXPLAINING SUFFICIENT.\nBUT THIS YEAR, BEING IN FRAY OF THE CAMPAIGN HAS TARNISHED HIM\nPERSONALLY IN JULY, IN \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" NBC NEWS\nPOLLING, WE HAD A REMARKABLE FINDING, WHICH IS THAT MORE\nPEOPLE VIEWED PRESIDENT CLINTON NEGATIVELY THAN VIEWED HIM\nPOSITIVELY AND WE HAD EVER SEEN THAT SINCE HE LEFT OFFICE.\n>> PUT HIS NUMBERS ARE BETTER THAN EITHER OF THE CURRENT\nCANDIDATES, AREN'T THEY? >> THAT'S RIGHT.\nWELL, WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHO IS POPULAR RIGHT NOW, YOU STILL\nHAVE VERY HIGH NUMBERS FOR MICHELLE OBAMA, OR BARACK OBAMA,\nFOR BERNIE SANDERS, BILL CLINTON DIPPED INTO NEGATIVE TERRITORY\nAND NOW SOMEWHAT POSITIVE. FAR DIM MINIMUMMERRED THAN\nBEFORE. THE SECOND THING IS THERE'S\nSOMETHING ABOUT THE MOMENT. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHO ARE THE\nVOTERS WHO HILLARY MOST HAS TO REACH I THINK ABOUT YOUNG VOTERS\nWHO SHE IS BEGINNING TO HAVE A REAL PROBLEM WITH.\nFROM -- AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS ARE STILL STRONG WITH HER BUT WE\nAWE A POLL OUT OF MICHIGAN THAT HAD THE STATE TIED.\nONE REASON, AFRICAN-AMERICANS ONLY ONLY 74% WERE GOING FOR\nHILLARY. SHE SHOULD BE IN THE 90s WITH\nTHEM.

THESE ARE TWO CANDIDATES WHO ARE\nTHE MOST DISLIKED AMONG ANY MAJOR PARTY CANDIDATES AND WE\nHAVE LOOKED BACK TO 1992. THEY BOTH HAVE AN IMAGE PROBLEM.\nTRUMP WENT TO MEXICO, GAVE A SPEECH THAT SHOWED HIS TAX PLAN.\nTHIS ISN'T SOMETHING HE NEEDED TO AN TAG NICE PEOPLE HE NEEDS.\n>> WHEN HE WENT TO MEXICO HE SAID ONING THERE, CAME BACK HERE\nAND TOLD A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STORY.\nTHAT WASN'T SEEN AS SOMETHING VICTORIOUS FOR HIM, WAS IT?\n>> WELL, LET'S SEE HOW IT WAS SEEP.\nWE'RE GETTING POLLING SHOWING HIM KWON -- CONSOLIDATING\nREPUBLICANS, AND YOUNG PEOPLE LEAVING HILLARY AN ISSUE RIGHT\nNOW BUT IF DONALD TRUMP STARTS TO CONSOLIDATE REPUBLICANS MORE\nTHAN BEFORE HE WILL BE ON BETTER FOOTING.\nTHE VENTS OF THE LAST FEW DAYS COULD HAVE HELPED.\n>> AARON, FROM \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL,\" A CORPORATE COUSIN OF\nUS. >> WHEN APPLE PUTS OUT A NEW\nIPHONE THE LINES STRETCH FOR BLOCK BUTS AT THE FLAGSHIP STORE\nHERE IN MANHATTAN, THE LINE IS BARELY AROUND THE CORNER, WHICH\nIS WEIRD.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\n>> THANK YOU. >> A LOT OF QUESTIONS BACK AND\nFORTH WHETHER DONALD TRUMP NEUTRALIZED THE BIRTHER ISSUE OR\nMADE IT WORSE. TAKE A LOOK.\n>> FOR FIVE YEARS HE HAS LED THE BIRTHER MOVEMENT TO\nDELEGITIMATIZE OUR FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT.\nTHERE IS NO ERASING IT IN HISTORY.\n>> HILLARY CLINTON AND HER CAMPAIGN OF 2008 STARTED THE\nBIRTHER CONTROVERSY. >> WE CANNOT BECOME INSENSITIVE\nTO WHAT HE SAYS AND WHAT HE STIRS UP.\nWE CAN'T JUST ACCEPT THIS. >> PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA WAS\nBORN IN THE UNITED STATES, PERIOD.\nNOW WE ALL WANT TO GET BACK TO MAKING AMERICA STRONG AND GREAT\nAGAIN. >> ALL RIGHT.\nSO, NOW, WILL THIS BECOME AN ISSUE, THE FACT HE ACKNOWLEDGED\nTHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA, AFTER MUCH SOUL SEARCHING HERE, WAS IN FACT\nBORN IN THE UNITED STATES? OR IS THIS GOING TO FEST CENTER\nOBVIOUSLY A LOT OF CLINTON SURROGATES, AND HILLARY CLINTON\nHERSELF SAID THAT HE HAS DELIBERATELY PUSHED A RACIST\nTHEME -- THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY -- AND HE SHOULD NOT GET OFF\nLIGHTLY HERE AND JUST ACKNOWLEDGING THAT AFTER THE\nFACT IS WAY AFTER THE FACT. GETTING RACIST SINCE 2011.\nGRANT IS THE AUTHOR OF \"BE ON SEED OR BE AVERAG.\"\nI GUESS EACH CAMP WILL BE OBSESSED WITH THIS STORY, WITH\nDEMOCRATS SAYING HE BROUGHT THIS UP, KEPT POUNDING AND IT NOW HE\nIS TRYING TO CORRECT IT AND HOPE EVERYONE MOVES ON.\nREPUBLICANS SAY MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK? >> I THINK THAT DONALD TRUMP --\nBY THE WAY GOOD, TO HAVE YOU BACK, NEIL.\n>> THANK YOU. >> I THINK DONALD TRUMP USED THE\nBIRTHER ISSUE TO INSERT HIMSELF IN POLITICS IN 2011 WHEN THE\nMEDIA WASN'T FOLLOWING HIM AND HE KNOWS THAT ATTENTION IS\nSENIOR TO THE INFORMATION. THE MEDIA WILL NOT COVER A GOOD\nIDEA. THEY HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING\nTHAT'S GOT SOME CHAOS. THEY'RE LIKE PIRANHAS AND HE\nINSERTED HIMSELF INTO THE POLITICAL CAMPAIGN IN 2011 WITH\nTHIS, AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE STILL CHASING THIS TODAY.\nIT'S NOT A CRISIS TO HIM. THIS IS BUSINESS AS USUAL TO\nDONALD. >> BUS IT AN ISSUE THAT ALL THE\nPOLL WES HAVE THAT SHOW HIM SURGE DOING NOT INCLUDE THIS\nLATEST DEVELOPMENT, AND MAYBE IT DOESN'T REGISTER, MAYBE IT DOES.\nBUT I THINK THE HOPE WAS HERE HE COULD MAKE SOME ENCROACHMENTS TO\nTHE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY. DON'T KNOW IF IT WILL MOVE THE\nNEEDLE ABOUT HE HAS TO HOPE TO MOVE IT ENOUGH YOU CAN PICK OFF\nSOME VOTES. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?\n>> I THINK -- I DON'T THINK HE IS CONCERN ABOUT THAT.\nTHINK HE IS CONCERN -- >> WHY DO IT?\nWHY DO IT, GRANT? >> YOU MEAN WHY COME CLEAN IT\nUP? JUST TO PUT IT SO REST SO HE CAN\nSAY -- I DON'T THINK EBELIEVES THAT, OKAY?\nNYE MORE THAN ANYBODY BELIEFS THAT MISS CLINTON HAD PNEUMONIA.\nI DON'T THINK HE BELIEVES OR CARES WHETHER HE WAS BORN IN\nHAWAI'I OR KENYA. I THINK HE WANTS TO CONTROL THE\nMEDIA, WHICH IS THE NUMBER ONE THING HE MUST DO RIGHT NOW.\nNOTICE, ATTENTION WINS BECAUSE BUSH SPENT 100 PLUS MILLION AND\nNOBODY WOULD LISTEN TO HIS GOOD IDEAS.\nSO, HERE HE IS GOING TO BE IN DEBATE.\nWE'RE NOT LISTENING TO JILL STEIN OR THE OTHER GUY, AND WE\nGOT -- WE'RE DOWN TO TWO PEOPLE THAT CAN CONTROL THE MEDIA AND\nHE IS DOING A -- >> HE DOES A BETTER JOB OF THAT.\nI THINK HILLARY CLINTON HERSELF HAS SAID HE IS AN ENTERTAINER,\nI'M NOT. SHE IS EMBRACING HER INNER WONK,\nTALKING ABOUT POLICY POSITIONS BUT IT'S HIS POLICY STATEMENTS,\nWHETHER YOU ACCEPT THEM OR NOT, THAT GET PRESS, WHETHER HE IS\nTALKING BEFORE THE ECONOMIC CLUB IN NEW YORK AND TAX PLAN AS\nCHILDCARE PLAN THE WOKE BEFORE. SO HE HAS A STRATEGY THERE.\nBUT DEBATES AND -- YOU CAN -- I THINK COME DOWN TO MORE EQ THAN\nIQ. MORE HOW YOU CONNECT EMOTIONALLY\nTHAN INTELLECTUALLY. BUT IT'S HOW PEOPLE AT HOME LOOK\nAT THAT AND SAY, YEAH, COULD SEE HIM OR HER BEING PRESIDENT.\nHOW DOES HE PLAY THAT THERE? >> I THINK HE IS GOING TO PLAY\nABOUT NINE INCHES TALLER, MORE CONFIDENT, AND HE IS DEFINITELY\nGOING TO BE LOOSER. SHE IS TIGHT.\nSHE IS PLAYING DEFENSE AND HE IS PLAYING OFFENSE.\nAND YOU CAN'T WIN THIS GAME, A WE DO BAIT GAME, PLAYING JUST\nDEFENSE. AND THAT IS WHAT SHE IS ON.\nSHE HEY HAS BEEN ON THAT FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS.\nHE DOESN'T HAVE A CRISIS. IT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL.\nGET ATTENTION, WIN PEOPLE OVER, AND KEEP THAT TV CAMERA IN MY\nFACE. >> ALL RIGHT.\nBUT HE IS ALSO THIS IDEA COMFORTABLE IN YOUR SKIN,\nWHETHER YOU LIKE THAT PERSON OR NOT THEY BOTH HAVE HIGH\nNEGATIVES AND BOTH CAN GET ANGRY.  THEY HAVE TO KEEP THAT\nIN CHECK, RIGHT? >> I THINK HE IS GOING TO CRUSH\nHER IN THE DEBATES, BIFFLE THE WAY.\n>> REALLY. >> I THINK HE'S GOING TO SHOT\nEVERYBODY. I'M GOING TO SEE HIM TONIGHT IN\nMIAMI AND HAVE DINNER WITH HIM ON MONDAY.\nTHE GUY IS COOL AS A CUCUMBER AND PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND IT\nROLLS OFF HIS BACK -- >> HE IS NOT GOING TO TRY TO\nOUTWONK HER AND SHE IS NOT GOING TO TRY TO OUTSTYLE HIM.\nIT COMES ACROSS HISTORY MORE COMFORTABLE IN THEIR OWN SHOES.\n>> NO MATTER WHAT HE DOES HE WILL NOT SHOCK AMERICA, ANYTHING\nSHE DOES, ANYTHING SHE DOES. SHE IS A POLITICIAN WILL SHOCK\nMRS.. >> DO YOU THINK SHE SETS THE\nSTAGE FOR THIS BY VILIFYING HIM TO SUCH A GREAT, SUCH A HATEFUL\nHUMAN BEING, THAT'S IF HE COMES ACROSS AS PRESENTABLE AND IS\nBREATHING, AND HE DOESN'T GET UPSET, HE WINS.\n>> I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT. AND I DON'T KNOW WHY SHE IS\nTALKING ABOUT THE BIRTHER THING, OR ANY OF THE DEMOCRATS ARE\nBECAUSE HE IS LIKE, I'M DONE WITH IT.\nWHY ARE WE STILL TALKING ABOUT IT?\nWHO CARES -- >> GALVANIZED HER BASE.\n>> BUT THEY'RE ALREADY GALVAN NIED.\nTHE PROBLEM IS WILL THEY GO VOTE AND I DOUBT THEY WILL BECAUSE\nNOBODY LIKES HER. THE GAVE THAT SLEEPS HER -- USED\nTO SLEEP WITH HER DOESN'T LIKE  --\n>> DON'T GO THERE. >> IF HAD TO.\nBE ON SEDESSED WITH YOUR HEALTH ENOUGH.\nIT'S TIME. >> THERE I'LL AGREE WITH.\nI'M HAVING OATMEAL. BE OBSESSED OR BE AVERAGE IS THE\nBOOK. WE'LL HAVE TO SAY IN THESE\nDEBATES. LET'S LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON,\nWALL AND BROAD. A WIDE, WHACKY WEEK BUT WE\nREALLY DIDN'T MOVE MUCH. IN FACT THE WEEK ENDED ALSO IT\nBEGAN SO IF DONALD TRUMP OR HILLARY CLINTON IN THEIR LITTLE\nSOAP OPERA BACK AND FORTH WAS SCARING THESE GUYS THEY HAVE A\nVERY, VERY FUNNY WAY OF SHOWING IT.\nJACK WELCH, WE JUST TALK TO HIM FOR ALSO WHILE HERE AND HE HAS\nBEEN OUT OF GE FOR A LONG TIME. A COUPLE OF DECADES.\nDO YOU KNOW HE STILL MOVES THE NEEDLE AND JOHN KASHICH, ONE OF\nTHOSE WHO WAS NOT REALLY FOLLOWING -- JACK'S ADVICE TO\nJUST GRIN AND BEAR IT AND DEAL WITH DONALD TRUMP, KASHICH\nWOULDN'T.

              "text": "LABEL OF BADGE OF HONOR FOR MANY\nTRUMP SUPPORTERS. AFTER A ROUGH COUPLE WEEKS\nINCLUDING CLINTON'S DEPLORABLES COMMENT, HER CAMPAIGN IS TRYING\nTO SHIFT THE FOCUS BACK ON TRUMP, WHICH IS CRITICIZING THE\nNOMINEE FOR COMMENTS HE MADE ON GUN CONTROL ACCUSING HIM OF\nINCITING VIOLENCE AND ENCOURAGING AN ASSASSINATION\nATTEMPT ON HILLARY CLINTON. TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT TRUMP\nACTUALLY SAID THOUGH AS HE WAS CRITICIZING CLINTON'S HYPOCRISY\nFOR WANTING TO TAKE AWAY PEOPLE'S GUNS.\nSHE HERSELF HAS ARMED BODYGUARDS TO PROTECT HER 24/7.\n>> I THINK THAT HER BODYGUARDS SHOULD DROP ALL WEAPONS.\nTHEY SHOULD DISARM. I THINK THEY SHOULD DISARM.\nIMMEDIATELY. WHAT DO YOU THINK, YES?\nYES. YEAH.\nTAKE THEIR GUNS AWAY. SHE DOESN'T WANT GUNS.\nLET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO HER. TAKE THEIR GUNS AWAY, OKAY.\nIT WOULD BE VERY DANGEROUS. >> CAMPAIGN ISSUED A STATEMENT\nAGAIN TRYING TO DEPICT TRUMP AS DANGEROUS, SAYING DONALD TRUMP\nHAS A PATTERN OF INCITING PEOPLE TO VIOLENCE, WHETHER THIS IS\nDONE TO PROVOKE PROTESTERS AT A RALLY OR CASUALLY OR EVEN AS A\nJOKE, IT IS AN UNACCEPTABLE QUALITY IN ANYONE SEEKING THE\nJOB OF COMMANDER IN CHIEF. IF YOU LOOK AT THE LATEST POLL\nNUMBERS, THERE'S GOOD REASON THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS DOING\nEVERYTHING IT CAN TO CHANGE THE NARRATIVE FROM CLINTON'S HEALTH,\nHER FAMILY'S FOUNDATION AND HER NUMEROUS OTHER SCANDALS.\nIN THE LATEST REAL CLEAR POLITICS AVERAGE SHE IS NOW\nLEADING TRUMP NATIONALLY BY JUST A POINT AND A HALF.\nTO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE, TWO WEEKS AGO SHE WAS AHEAD BY SIX.\n>> ISN'T THAT AMAZING? >> THANKS A MILLION, GARRETT.\nLET'S BRING IN OUR OLD FRIEND CHRIS STIREWALT.\nGOOD MORNING, CHRIS. >> I AIN'T THAT OLD.\n>> BY OUR STANDARDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE.\nSO YOU KIND OF GET WHAT TRUMP IS SAYING.\nHE'S SAYING THIS IS HYPOCRIICAL AND IT'S PART OF A LONG PATTERN\nOF HYPOCRISY. SO SHE'S AGAINST CARBON\nFOOTPRINTS BUT FLIES PRIVATE, FOR DIVERSITY BUT SENDS HER\nDAUGHTER TO SIDWELL, ET CETERA. >> ET CETERA.\n>> SHE HAS ARMED MEN AROUND HER. WHY IS THE PRESS MAKING IT SOUND\nAS IF HE WAS CALLING FOR HER ASSASSINATION?\n>> HE WASN'T CALLING FOR HER ASSASSINATION, HE WAS LAZY.\nHE WAS LINGUISTICALLY LAZY. AND THEY'RE GOING TO BUST HIM ON\nIT BECAUSE, WELL, BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO.\nBUT IN ADDITION TO THAT HE REQUOED THEM YESTERDAY, AS\nSOMEBODY SAID, HE TRICKED THE PRESS YESTERDAY INTO IT WAS A\nTRUMP TRIUMPH. HE FOOLED THE PRESS INTO COMING\nAND GIVING HIM AN INFO MER SHL FOR HIS NEW HOTEL IN WASHINGTON\nAND COVERING A LENGTHY RALLY WHERE FORMER -- WHERE RETIRED\nMILITARY OFFICERS ENDORSED HIM, SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE NEVER\nGOTTEN THE KIND OF COVERAGE IT DID.\nSO IN THE END HE COULD EXECUTE HIS FLIP-FLOP ON BIRTHERISM.\nSO THEY'RE MAD, SO TURNABOUT HE TRICKED THEM, NOW THEY'RE\nTRICKING HIM AND SO IT GOES. >> SO HERE'S WHAT THE \"NEW YORK\nTIMES\" SAID. THEY SAID DONALD J. TRUMP ONCE\nAGAIN RAISED THE SPECK TOR OF VIOLENCE AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON\nSUGGESTING ON FRIDAY THAT THE SECRET SERVICE AGENTS WHO GUARD\nHER VOLUNTARILY DISARM TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO HER WITHOUT\nTHEIR PROTECTION. IS THIS A MATTER OF THE MEDIA\nNOT FULLY LISTENING TO WHAT HE SAID AND BEING A BIT LAZY ABOUT\nIT? BECAUSE WE ALL HEARD THE\nSTATEMENT HE MADE. IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR WHAT HE WAS\nTRYING TO SAY THERE. >> WELL, LET'S MAKE NO\nMISTAKE -- >> THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN THE\nBEST WORDS HE COULD HAVE USED, RIGHT.\n>> MAKE NO MISTAKE THAT WAS SLOPPY.\nHE SHOULD DO BETTER THAN THAT. I UNDERSTAND THE PHILOSOPHICAL\nPOINT. THIS IS EXACTLY WHY HIS NEW HANDLERS, WHY HE HAS A POLLSTER\nIN CHARGE OF HIS CAMPAIGN, WHY HE'S ON A MORE DISCIPLINED\nMESSAGE, BECAUSE YOU DON'T LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE\nNOT GOING TO GIVE YOU THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT TO MAKE\nTHINGS OUT OF WHAT YOU SAY. THIS IS WHY HE SHOULD STAY ON\nTELEPROMPTER, WHY HE SHOULD BE THE DISCIPLINED CANDIDATE THAT\nHE IS AS GARRETT WAS MENTIONING EARLIER THE RACE IS BACK TO\nBEING CLOSE AND HE NEEDS TO STAY IN IT.\n>> YOU TALK ABOUT HAVING A DISCIPLINED MESSAGE.\nWE HEARD AFTER HILLARY CLINTON'S PNEUMONIA BREAK THAT SHE TOOK\nOVER THE WEEKEND THAT SHE WAS GOING TO COME OUT AND TALK ABOUT\nFAMILIES AND CHILDREN AND THAT WAS WHAT THE FOCUS OF THE\nCAMPAIGN WAS GOING TO BE GOING FORWARD.\n>> NO. >> AND THEN YOU HAVE HER\nCAMPAIGN RESPONDING TO TRUMP AND CALLING HIM NAMES AND GOING BACK\nINTO THAT MESS AGAIN. WE THOUGHT MAYBE THERE WOULD BE\nSOME ELEVATION FROM HER SIDE. IS SHE STILL ON MESSAGE, OR ARE\nWE CHANGING BACK AGAIN? >> YOU AND ME BOTH KNOW WHAT THE\nREST OF THIS DADGUM CAMPAIGN IS GOING TO BE ABOUT, AND THAT IS\nGOING TO BE THESE TWO HUMAN BEINGS WHO ARE NOT WELL LIKED BY\nTHE REST OF THE COUNTRY TRYING TO MAKE THE OTHER ONE LESS\nLIKABLE EVEN STILL. THIS IS GOING TO BE A HEINOUS\nRACE TO THE BOTTOM AS THESE TWO CAMPAIGNS TRY TO DESTROY ONE\nANOTHER DAY AFTER DAY. >> TO YOUR POINT YOU ALWAYS WANT\nWHAT YOU CAN'T HAVE. MICHELLE OBAMA WAS OUT ON THE\nSTUMP FOR HILLARY CLINTON AND THINGS GOT A LITTLE BIT AWKWARD\nWHEN THE CROWD STARTED CHEERING FOR MICHELLE INSTEAD OF HILLARY\nCLINTON. WATCH THIS.\n>> IT IS SO HARD TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS LESS THAN TWO MONTHS TO\nELECTION DAY. AND THAT MY FAMILY IS ALMOST AT\nTHE END OF OUR TIME AT THE WHITE HOUSE.\nYEAH. IT'S ALMOST TIME.\nAND LET ME SAY, I HAVE TO SAY -- NO, NO.\n>> FOUR MORE YEARS! >> YOU CAN HEAR THEM, THEY'RE\nSHOUTING FOUR MORE YEARS. CHRIS, DOES THIS HIGHLIGHT THE\nBIGGEST CHALLENGE THAT CLINTON CONTINUES TO HAVE, JUST THE LACK\nOF EXCITEMENT EVEN AMONG HER OWN BASE?\n>> WELL, YES. SO DOUBLE EDGED SWORD HERE.\nWHEN YOU BRING OUT -- MICHELLE OBAMA IS VERY POPULAR.\nAND SHE IS BELOVED OBVIOUSLY BY DEMOCRATS, BUT SHE'S BROADLY\nPOPULAR TOO. SHE AND HER HUSBAND ARE KEYS TO\nHILLARY CLINTON'S HOPES OF GENERATING ENOUGH BASE\nENTHUSIASM BECAUSE AS POLLS CONTINUE TO SHOW, DONALD TRUMP'S\nSUPPORT REMAINS STEADY. HE DOESN'T GO UP, BUT HE DOESN'T\nGO DOWN EITHER BECAUSE HIS VOTERS ARE OUT FOR HIM IN FORCE.\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS A LOT MORE SLACK IN THE LINE BECAUSE\nYOUNGER VOTERS AND MINORITY VOTERS CONTINUE TO BE SKEPTICAL\nOF HER AS THEIR CHAMPION. SO SHE NEEDS THE OBAMAS TO DO\nTHIS FOR HER. BUT AS THEY COME OUT, AS YOU\nSAY, IT REMINDS FOLKS THAT, WELL, SHE'S NOT HER.\n>> YEAH. SO JUST TO THE RACE GENERALLY,\nI'M READING THIS PIECE IN NEW YORK NEWS THE OTHER DAY, I KNOW,\nI'M THE ONLY ONE, AND IN IT THERE'S A COAT FROM FLEISCHER\nQUOTING, TRUMP'S NOT GOING TO WIN -- VIRGINIA'S OVER.\nWE KNOW THAT. SO I GO TO THE RCP NUMBERS AND I\nSEE ACTUALLY VIRGINIA HAS THINNED THE MARGINS TO THREE\nPOINTS AND TREND LINES ARE HILLARY STRAIGHT DOWN AND TRUMP\nSTRAIGHT UP. DOESN'T MEAN HE'S GOING TO WIN,\nBUT SHOULD WE START THINKING WHAT WE THINK WE KNOW ALL THE\nDUMB PEOPLE POSING IN WASHINGTON AS SMART PEOPLE HAVE BEEN\nTELLING US? >> HEY, LEAVE US DUMB PEOPLE\nPOSING AT SMART PEOPLE ALONE. I GOT TUITION TO PAY.\nI GOT TUITION TO PAY. NO, LOOK, I WOULD SAY THIS, THE\nRACE IS CLOSE IN A LOT OF STATES.\nIT'S CLOSER IN TEXAS THAN WE THOUGHT.\nIT'S DEFINITELY CLOSER IN ARIZONA, GEORGIA AND A LOT OF\nPLACES. HERE'S WHY.\nTHESE ARE TWO CANDIDATES FUNCTIONING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE\nREGISTER. THEY'RE BOTH IN THE LOW 40s.\nTHIS IS WHAT YOU SEE IN AN ELECTION WHERE YOU HAVE 20% OF\nTHE ELECTORATE THAT IS SAYING EITHER NEITHER OR SOMEONE ELSE.\nAND THAT IS INDICATIVE OF A DISSATISFIED ELECTORATE.\nAND I THINK A LOT OF STATES LOOK CLOSER THAN THEY PROBABLY ARE\nBECAUSE PEOPLE ARE REFUSING TO MAKE THEIR MINDS UP BECAUSE\nTHEY'RE DISSATISFIED. >> CHRIS, SADLY, I'M A PODCAST\nJUNKIE. >> MAN.\n>> I LISTEN TO PODCAST CONSTANTLY.\nWHEN I LEARN YOU AND DANA PERRINO LAUNCHED A POD CAST\nDURING THE DNC OR AROUND THAT TIME, I IMMEDIATELY SUBSCRIBED\nAND I LOVED IT. NOW THEY'RE TAKING THIS PODCAST,\nI DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE THINKING.\nTHEY MUST BE CRAZY. THEY'RE PUTTING IT ON\nTELEVISION, RIGHT? TOMORROW AT 5:00 P.M.\n>> UH-HUH. IT'S TRUE.\nAND I WAS REALLY ENCOURAGED BY ALL OF THE MOVES THAT I SAW\nTAKING PLACE IN THE FOX NEWS CHANNEL.\nI THOUGHT THIS PLACE IS DOING A GREAT JOB.\nTHEN THEY GAVE ME A TELEVISION SHOW, AND I STARTED TO QUESTION\nTHEIR JUDGMENT. I STARTED TO HAVE DOUBTS ABOUT\nTHIS. BUT THEY GOT PERINO ON IT, SO WE\nCAN'T SCREW IT UP. >> YEAH, IT LAUNCHES TONIGHT.\n>> WE'RE GOING TO DO CRAFTS. PROBABLY A LOT OF CRAFTS.\nI'M GOING TO DO SOME BOB ROSS PAINTING.\nNO, LOOK, IT'S 5:00 ON SUNDAY,",

AND IF IT HAPPENS NEXT WEEK,\nIT'S GOING TO HAPPEN DURING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S TENURE, WHICH\nHAS BEEN A TERRIBLE RECORD WHEN IT COMES TO THE ECONOMY.\n>> AND JESS, A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THE FEDERAL RESERVE WON'T\nHIKE RATES NEXT WEEK BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO HURT HILLARY\nCLINTON. >> YEAH, I'VE HEARD THAT.\nTHAT'S THE THEORY DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN FLOATING WHEN ACTUALLY\nWE KNOW THAT THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE COMMITTEE IT'S FIVE\nPOLITICAL APPOINTEES AND SEVEN WHO ARE NOT POLITICAL\nAPPOINTEES. HE'S ACTUALLY GONE BACK AND\nFORTH. FIRST HE SAID IT WAS A POLITICAL\nDECISION THEN SAID JANET YELLEN IS GREAT AND THEN BACK TO A\nPOLITICAL DECISION. BUT I WANT TO AGREE WITH THE\nPANEL FOR PART OF THIS AND SAY I THINK IT WOULD HURT HILLARY\nCLINTON IF WE HAVE VOLATILITY. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO ADD THIS\nWEEK WE JUST FOUND OUT THAT MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME WENT UP\n$2,800 FROM LAST YEAR, WHICH I THINK IS THE BIGGEST SPIKE WE'VE\nEVER SEEN AND POVERTY RATE DROPPED BY OVER A PERCENTAGE\nPOINT. THESE ARE IMPORTANT INDICATORS\nADDING ONTO THAT THE 15 MILLION PRIVATE SECTOR JOBS WE'VE\nGOTTEN. YOU KNOW THE REST I'M GOING TO\nSTAY THERE. I'M GOING TO HAVE TO DEFEND THE\nOBAMA ECONOMY A LITTLE BIT THERE AND ALSO SAY ALL THE POLLS\nINDICATE THAT WALL STREET AND THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY TRUST\nHILLARY CLINTON TO BE THE STEWARD, NOT DONALD TRUMP.\n>> BUT DONALD TRUMP POLLS BETTER ON HIS HANDLING OF THE ECONOMY.\n>> SHE WAS UP FIVE IN A RECENT POLL ON THAT.\n>> FOX NEWS -- I'M CITING HOME POLL.\n>> ALL RIGHT. >> I'LL POINT OUT RETAIL SALES\nWERE DOWN FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE EARLIER THIS YEAR LAST\nMONTH. >> MITT ROMNEY POLLED WELL ON\nTHE ECONOMY, I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO LOCK IN ANY\nELECTION. IF THE MARKET DOESN'T TANK, THEN\nRAISING RATES BEFORE THE ELECTION, WHICH I THINK IS GOING\nTO HAPPEN EVEN THOUGH IT'S AN UNUSUAL CALL AT THIS POINT,\nWOULD ACTUALLY HELP HILLARY BECAUSE THE PERCEPTION, WRONG OR\nIT'S TOTALLY A CONSPIRACY THEORY THAT THE FED IS SUPPORTING THE\nECONOMY, THAT IT'S REALLY A RECESSION OR A DEPRESSION IF WE\nDIDN'T HAVE 0% RATE IT'S ALL GOING TO COME CRASHING DOWN.\nYOU MAKE THAT MYTH GO AWAY BY RAISING RATES A LITTLE BIT.\nIT SHOWS YOU COULD GO OFF VERY GOOD ECONOMIC NEWS WE JUST GOT,\nTHAT'S THE BEST NEWS THEY GOT AT THE FED IN ABOUT A YEAR OR TWO.\nTHE MARKET MIGHT NOT TANK THIS TIME BECAUSE OF THAT.\nAND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE FED ISN'T SUPPORTING THE CLINTON\nADMINISTRATION, WHICH IS THE PERCEPTION EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT\nTRUE. AND I THINK IT ACTUALLY HELPS US\nWE'RE FINALLY OUT OF THE '07 CRASH.\nWE DON'T NEED TO HAVE 0% RATE, I SAY THAT'S THE CALL TO MAKE.\n>> BUT INTEREST RATES IF YOU LOOK BACK HISTORICALLY, WHAT\nINTEREST RATES DO AND WHAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE DOES, JOHN, DOES\nIMPACT THE ELECTION. LET'S NOT FORGET THE DOUBLE\nDIGIT INTEREST RATE ON THE 10-YEAR TREASURY IN 1980.\nAND THE STATUS OF THE ECONOMY THEN CERTAINLY HELPED RONALD\nREAGAN. >> YEAH, IT CERTAINLY HELPED.\nAND I THINK YOU WOULD SAY THAT THE FED RIGHT NOW HAS REALLY\nBEEN ABLE TO HELP THIS ADMINISTRATION.\nI DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE POLITICAL IN THAT OR THEY'RE\nJUST TRYING TO HELP THE ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE THE\nECONOMY IS SUFFERING SO BAD. AND THE ECONOMY IS NOT DOING\nWELL. LOOK, IT'S NOT IN A RECESSION.\nIT'S NOT IN OPPRESSION, BUT IT'S NOT DOING WELL, BUT WE HAVE 121\nMILLION FULL-TIME JOBS RIGHT NOW.\nTHAT'S ALMOST EXACTLY WHAT WE HAD IN 2008 BEFORE THE\nRECESSION. THE JOBS THAT HAVE BEEN ADDED\nHAVE BEEN PART-TIME JOBS THAT HAVE COME ONLINE.\nJOBS THAT HAVE BEEN REPLACED WITH JOBS THAT ARE NOT QUITE AS\nGOOD JOBS. HOUSEHOLD INCOMES ARE DOWN SINCE\n2000, WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT POVERTY, GIVE ME A FREAKING\nBREAK. IT'S GONE FROM 17 MILLION IN\n2000 TO 47 MILLION RIGHT NOW WITH FOOD STAMPS, THAT GOES ONE\nFOR ONE IN CORRELATION FROM POVERTY TO FOOD STAMPS.\nTHE ONE THING THAT HAS BENEFITTED AS GARY B. SAYS IS\nTHE STOCK MARKET. AND IT'S BECAUSE OF COMPARISONS.\nYOU HAVE 80% OF GOVERNMENT OBLIGATED DEBT FROM GERMANY AND\nJAPAN THAT ARE NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES.\nAMERICA IS THE ONLY PLACE TO PUT THAT MONEY.\nAND IF YOU HAVE THE FED RAISING RATES RIGHT NOW, IT'S GOING TO\nHURT THE ONE THING THAT IS BOOMING AND THAT IS THE STOCK\nMARKET. YOU DO IT NEXT WEEK, THAT'S\nGOING TO BENEFIT DONALD TRUMP. >> KATIE, YOU RAISED THIS ISSUE\nABOUT HOW PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT THE ECONOMY GOING BACK ALMOST EIGHT\nYEARS. BUT I LOOK BACK AT THE RECESSION\nWHEN GEORGE BUSH 41 WAS RUNNING FOR RE-ELECTION.\nTHAT RECESSION ENDED IN EARLY 1991.\nAND IT STILL HURT HIM, EVEN THOUGH THE RECESSION HAD BEEN\nOVER ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF. >> YEAH, LOOK, ECONOMIC TURMOIL,\nWHICH I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE CLEARLY SAID HAS\nBEEN A PART OF THE DECISION THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE IN\nNOVEMBER CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO\nACCOUNT HERE. WHEN YOU POLL ON A NUMBER OF\nISSUES DESPITE MAYBE THE NEWS OF THE DAY, OUTSIDE THE ECONOMY,\nTHE NUMBER ONE THING THAT PEOPLE VOTE ON IS THE ECONOMY EVERY\nSINGLE TIME. AND SO IF THEY SEE THAT THEIR\n401(k) IS LOSING MONEY NEXT WEEK, IF THEY SEE INSTABILITY IN\nTHE MARKETPLACE, THEY'RE GOING TO GO WITH THE PERSON WHO THEY\nFEEL HAS THE BEST BUSINESS INTERESTS AND BEST DECISIONS\nWHEN IT COMES TO GETTING AWAY FROM THE OBAMA ECONOMY AND\nMOVING FORWARD WITH A DIFFERENT SOLUTION OUTSIDE OF GOVERNMENT\nINTRUSION. >> JESS, YOU'RE SHAKING YOUR\nHEAD. >> NO, NO, IT WAS A LITTLE BIT\nOF AGREEMENT. IT WAS LIKE QUASI BOBBLE HEAD.\nI KIND OF AGREE. IT'S BEEN THE STRANGE THING THE\nLAST FEW MONTHS OBAMA HAS A HIGH APPROVAL RATING BUT STILL 70%\nSAY WE'RE ON THE WRONG TRACK AND PEOPLE SAY ECONOMIC INDICATORS\nWHATEVER THEY MIGHT BE THEY STILL DON'T FEEL SECURE, RIGHT,\nABOUT THEIR FUTURE? WE HAVE ISSUES OF PEOPLE\nBELIEVING IN THE AMERICAN DREAM TODAY, ET CETERA.\nI THINK PART OF THAT IS A COMMUNICATION PROBLEM ON THE\nPART OF THE ADMINISTRATION. AND IT'S JUST ON THE GROUND\nTHINGS DON'T FEEL AS GOOD AS MAYBE THEY DO IN THE PAPERS AS\nIT WERE. SO I TOTALLY TAKE THAT POINT.\nAND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HILLARY CLINTON REALLY HAS\nTO BATTLE AGAINST. YOU KNOW, BECAUSE SHE HAS TO\nCELEBRATE ACCOMPLISHMENTS, BUT ALSO SAY I'M GOING TO DO THINGS\nA LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE HURTING.\n>> ONE FINAL THING, GARY B., I WANT TO POINT OUT, THE FEDERAL\nRESERVE, MEMBERS OF THE FED MET WITH THIS LIBERAL ACTIVIST GROUP\nCALLED FED UP IN AUGUST, HOW ABOUT SAYING I'M SORRY TO ALL\nTHE FAVORS GOING BACK THE LAST EIGHT YEARS OR MORE?\nHOW ABOUT SAYING SORRY? SO TO THE PEOPLE WHO SAY THE\nFED'S NOT POLITICAL, WELL, THEY ARE POLITICAL.\n>> WELL, YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. WHETHER THEY SAY THEY'RE\nINDEPENDENT OR WHETHER THEY'RE NOT, THEY'RE JUST LIKE ANYONE\nELSE. THEY WANT TO KEEP THEIR JOBS.\nAND MOST OF MANY OF THEIR JOBS WERE UNDER THIS CURRENT\nADMINISTRATION. THAT'S WHY I THINK THEY'RE GOING\nTO STAND PAT UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION.\nAS FAR AS JESSICA SAYING THAT HILLARY WANTS TO CELEBRATE THE\nACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE ECONOMY, I'D SAY WHAT ACCOMPLISHMENTS?\nALMOST EVERY METRIC COMPARED TO WHEN OBAMA TOOK OFFICE IS\nNEGATIVE OR DOWN. THERE ARE NO ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN\nTHIS ECONOMY. THE ONLY ONE THEY CAN POINT TO\nIS THE STOCK MARKET GOING UP. AND I CLAP FOR OBAMA ON THAT.\nTHAT'S ABOUT TO COME DOWN IF INTEREST RATES GO UP.\n>> FINAL WORD. THANK YOU, GARY.\nAND THANKS EVERYBODY. CAVUTO ON BUSINESS ABOUT 20\nMINUTES FROM NOW. NEIL, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?\n>> DONALD TRUMP LOOKS LIKE PRESIDENT TAFT.\nWE'VE GOT THE SKINNY ON ALL THE UNHEALTHY ACCUSATIONS ON THE\nCAMPAIGN TRAIL. LET'S JUST SAY BOTH SIDES NEED A\nHEALTHY DOSE OF REALITY.",

BEFORE AND AFTER, EVERY SINGLE\nBREATH AND LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE GONE THROUGH HELL.\n>> WAS THAT A BEFORE PICTURE OF TAFT?\nDO WE KNOW? WASN'T HE THE GUY WHO WAS STUCK\nIN A BATHTUB? >> HE'S THE GUY WHEN HE USED TO\nEAT, HE KNEW HE WAS FULL WHEN THE STOMACH HIT THE TABLE, I\nTHINK. >> THAT'S HOW I JUDGE.\n>> IF I MAY, DONALD TRUMP 70 YEARS OLD, I'VE NEVER SEEN\nSTAMINA. HE'S LIKE THE SPRINGSTEEN OF THE\nPOLITICAL WORLD. >> I HEAR YOU.\n>> BRUCE CAN DO FOUR-HOUR CONCERTS, I'M TELLING YOU I'VE\nNEVER SEEN STAMINA -- >> IT'S THE ELECTROLYTES IN THE\nKENTUCKY FRIED CHICKEN. I'M TELLING YOU.\n>> IT IS A GRUELING THING THOUGH.\nADAM, I THINK IT'S BEEN BRAVE, SO THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ASSUMED\nIT'S THE AGE THING, THE FACT IS WE KNEW IN RETROSPECT THAT JACK\nKENNEDY HAD A LOT OF HEALTH ISSUES, BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT\nTHEM. SHOULD WE HAVE A BETTER\nPROCEDURE THAN RELY ON THEIR RESPECTIVE DOCTORS PASSING\nINFORMATION ALONG? OH, YOU HAD A GUY SIGN, WHETHER\nIT'S REVEALED ON \"DR. OZ\" OR HILLARY CLINTON BELATEDLY AFTER\nTHE FACT FROM A BED IN CHAPPAQUA.\n>> WELL, THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS WE KNOW WAY MORE NOW THAN\nWE'VE EVER KNOWN BEFORE. CERTAINLY AS YOU SAID, WHEN\nKENNEDY -- >> I DON'T THINK WE DO.\nI DON'T THINK WE DO. >>\nWELL, EVEN GETTING A ONE-PAGE JOKE STATEMENT FROM TRUMP'S\nDOCTOR, THAT'S AGAIN, MORE THAN WE WOULD HAVE HAD --\n>> DOESN'T BOTHER YOU WE GOT MIXED STATEMENTS FROM HILLARY\nCLINTON? >> SURE.\nYEAH, I MEAN, I THINK THE ELECTORATE NEEDS TO KNOW AS MUCH\nAS IT CAN ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THESE PEOPLE CAN DO THE JOB.\nI WANT TO SAY, NEIL, I THINK IT'S DISGUSTING THAT BOTH CAMPS\nBEHAVE SO IMPOLITELY. I KNOW I'M GOING TO SOUND NAIVE\nSAYING THIS, BUT I THINK IT'S JUST TERRIBLE THAT THIS IS THE\nDISCOURSE THAT WE HAVE IN OUR COUNTRY.\nTHEY SHOULD BE BEHAVING LIKE GROWN-UPS, NOT CHILDREN ON THE\nPLAYGROUND. AND, AGAIN, I KNOW HOW THAT\nSOUNDS. >> YEAH, I KNOW.\n>> I'M BEING NAIVE, BUT I THINK IT'S TERRIBLE.\n>> YOU KNOW WHAT MIGHT SOUND TERRIBLE HERE, THE DISCUSSION ON\nTHIS, KENNEDY, THERE WERE DOCTORS ARGUING BACK AND FORTH\nBETWEEN OBESE AND APPARENTLY THE NEXT STAGE, MORBIDLY OBESE.\nAND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, ISN'T IT BAD ENOUGH TO CALL SOMEONE\nOBESE? AND THEN YOU'RE SAYING, NO, NO,\nYOU'RE SO BAD, YOU'RE MORBID. SO I'M THINKING TO MYSELF, I'M\nTHERE AND I DON'T WANT YOU TO MAKE ME FEEL ANY MORE\nVULNERABLE, YOU KNOW?  >> NO, PUTS YOU IN AN INCREDIBLY\nVULNERABLE POSITION. I THINK HARRY REID AND HER OTHER\nSURROGATES ARE SO FAR OFF BASE ON THIS BECAUSE THEY'RE\nHIGHLIGHTING DONALD TRUMP'S AGE AND HIS WEIGHT.\nAND THEY HAVE AN OLD CANDIDATE WHO ALSO HAPPENS TO BE SLIGHTLY\nPORTLY. SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO\nHIGHLIGHT -- >> THAT BEATS MORBIDLY BY THE\nWAY. >> WE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE HILLARY\nCLINTON WON'T RELEASE HER WEIGHT SO WE CAN'T GET AN ACCURATE BMI.\nIF THAT'S THE INDEX THAT YOU WANT TO GO BY, IF YOU WANT THE\nHEALTHIEST PRESIDENT, THEN VOTE FOR GARY JOHNSON.\nHE'S SUMMITED THE HIGHEST PEAKS IN -- ON THE GLOBE, THE SEVEN\nHIGHEST PEAKS ON EVERY CONTINENT.\n>> AND HE LIKES POT. >> COMPLETED SEVERAL --\n>> WHICH MAKES YOU HUNGRY. >> HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HE WAS UP\nTHERE. HE JUST KIND OF LOOKED AROUND,\nWHERE AM I NOW? MT. McKINLY, WHAT?\nPUT IT DOWN. >> HE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING UP\nTHE POCONOS. >> MT. EVEREST, WOW!\n>> THIS GUY'S A MANIAC. YOU KNOW, I CHALLENGED HIM --\n>> DON'T GO THERE. >> THAT 22 PUSH-UPS, I\nCHALLENGED AND I DID 22 PUSH-UPS, I SAID I CHALLENGE\nCHARLIE. YOU KNOW WHAT HE TEXTED ME BACK?\nI COULD DO 100. >> CHARLIE, YOU DON'T WANT -- MY\nDOCTOR FIRST THING COMES OUT NEIL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE\nDOING, 10,000 STEPS A MINIMUM A DAY.\nI SAID CAN I DRIVE THEM? APPARENTLY THAT WAS NOT AN\nOPTION. BUT, YOU KNOW, WE LOOK AT THESE\nISSUES. WE ENDED THE WEEK, IF YOU THINK\nABOUT IT, AND YOU CAN HELP ME WITH THIS, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT\nTHE BERTHER ISSUE, AGAIN, ALL THIS STUFF, BUT WE BEGAN TALKING\nABOUT WEIGHT AND HEALTH AND WHETHER THEY'RE UP TO THE TASK.\nBUT DO ANY OF THESE KIND OF ISSUES EVEN MATTER UNLESS IT' EGREGIOUS?\n>> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT, BUT DONALD TRUMP GAVE A GREAT\nECONOMIC SPEECH THIS WEEK. I THINK IT WAS HIS BEST SPEECH\nSO FAR IN THIS ELECTION. >> BUT WAS IT ENDORSED?\n>> IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN, BUT HERE'S -- HE COULD SET THE\nAGENDA. AND IF HE'S SMART, HE'LL DEAL\nWITH WHAT HE'S DEALING WITH NOW. YOU KNOW, GET IT OUT OF THE WAY,\nTHE BIRTHER THING CAME ON FRIDAY.\n>> IT'S ALL ABOUT PLANNING -- >> YES, BUT THEN GO FORWARD.\n>> NEIL. >> GO AHEAD.\n>> NEIL, YOU MAKE A GOOD POINT. AT THE END OF THE DAY, AT THE\nEND OF THE WEEK, NONE OF THIS IS GOING TO EFFECT THE PEOPLE WHO\nARE UNDECIDED. >> I'M GOING TO HAVE DISAGREE.\n>> I THINK IT MIGHT. >> IT'S NOT THE WEIGHT ISSUE OR\nANYTHING ELSE. IT'S HOW HILLARY HANDLED IT.\nTHIS IS WHY HER POLLS NOSE DIVE. YOU LOOK AT EVERY POLL TAKEN\nTHROUGH 9/11, 9/12, THE WAY SHE HANDLED THIS, ADAM, IT IS\nAMAZING. ALL SHE HAD TO DO IS SAY\nSATURDAY MORNING I'VE GOT PNEUMONIA, I'M GOING DOWN TO THE\n9/11 MEMORIAL FOR 30 MINUTES AND PEOPLE WOULD HAVE VIEWED HER AS\nTRULY GUTTING IT OUT. >> THINK OF IT THIS WAY --\n>> DO YOU THINK IT'S A VALID POINT?\n>> LOOK AT IT THIS WAY, ADAM. DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T LIE ABOUT\nHIS WEIGH -- >> DID HE GIVE A FIGURE?\n>> 236. >> OH, REALLY?\n>> HE'S HEAVY. >> I WOULD ANSWER THAT, YOU MEAN\nON EARTH? >> YOU KNOW HE'S HEAVY, HE\nDOESN'T LIE ABOUT THE FACT HE LIKES TO EAT, YOU KNOW,\nMcDONALD'S AND KFC. BUT HILLARY CLINTON DID LIE.\nTHEY TOLD ANYBODY THAT QUESTION -- DEMOCRATS TOLD\nANYBODY THAT QUESTIONED HER HEALTH THEY CALLED THEM ALL\nSORTS OF NAMES. >> SO SHE WAS CAUGHT OFF GUARD.\nSHE KIND OF PLAYED THAT -- TRIED TO PLAY -- WELL, TONE TO THE\nGROUP AT THE END OF THE WEEK I HAD WEIGHT GAIN, SOME WOMEN KNOW\nABOUT THAT -- I DON'T KNOW, TOO LITTLE TOO LATE.\nBUT, KENNEDY, MY QUESTION GOING FORWARD, ARE THESE THE ISSUES\nONES THAT ARE GOING TO DOMINATE? SOMETIMES, WITH ALL RESPECT TO\nADAM, I THINK THEY'RE MORE DOMINANT THAN PEOPLE THINK.\nIT WAS RONALD REAGAN IN THAT DEBATE WITH CARTER WITH THERE\nYOU GO AGAIN. AND PEOPLE FORGOT THE SUBSTANCE\nOF THE DEBATE. SO WHEN THEY DO GO AGAINST EACH\nOTHER, YOU KNOW, A WEEK FROM MONDAY, WILL IT BE THIS KIND OF\nSTUFF THAT SETS TONE? >> I THINK THIS DEFINITELY SETS\nTHE TONE BECAUSE WE ARE JUST A LITTLE OVER A WEEK OUT FROM THAT\nFIRST CRITICAL DEBATE. AND I DON'T THINK WE CAN PLACE\nHIGH ENOUGH IMPORTANCE ON THAT. EVERYONE WILL BE TUNING IN TO\nSEE WHAT THE CANDIDATES BRING UP, HOW THEY REACT TO EACH\nOTHER. AND I THINK THAT BOTH OF THEM\nWILL BRING THIS UP AS AN ISSUE. I THINK IT'S A BIGGER ACHILLES\nHEEL FOR HER NOT OM BECAUSE SHE APPEARS TO BE THE MORE\nPHYSICALLY FRAGILE OF THE TWO, BUT AS CHARLES POINTED OUT, THE\nFACT SHE BLATANTLY LIED ABOUT IT AND HER HUSBAND CAME OUT WITH\nTHE GAFFE AND SAID SHE HAD THE FLU.\nWHICH I IT? AND DIDN'T TELL HER DAUGHTER SHE\nHAD PNEUMONIA? >> NOT SUCH A THIN SKIN, RIGHT?\n>> I THINK DONALD TRUMP'S DOING GREAT WITH JIMMY FALLON THIS\nWEEK. >> RIGHT, THE HAIR THING.\n>> IT WAS PERFECT. GOING ON DR. OZ WAS BRILLIANT, A\nLOT OF WOMEN WATCHING, HE JOKED ABOUT IT, I'D LIKE TO LOSE SOME\nWAIT. >> I THINK THE LITMUS TEST IS\nWHEN THE MEDIA SCOFFS AT IT, THEN YOU KNOW HE MUST BE ON THE\nRIGHT TRACK, YOU KNOW? >> YEAH, COULD BE.\n>> IN PUBLIC EATING KFC, YOU THINK?\n>> WE CAN ONLY HOPE. >> ALL RIGHT.\nMEANWHILE, WILL THIS ISSUE COME UP AT THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL\nDEBATE? WE'LL SEE.\nLIVE COVERAGE ALL NEXT WEEKEND RIGHT HERE ON FOX, AHEAD OF THAT\nDEBATE 10:00 A.M. SATURDAY MORNING, 4:00 P.M. ON SUNDAY\nWE'RE GOING TO BE LIVE FROM THE SITE IN NEW YORK WHERE THE FIRST\nDEBATE WILL TAKE PLACE. AND MONDAY IT ALL GOES DOWN\nWE'RE TEEING UP A SPECIAL PRIMETIME COVERAGE ON THE FOX\nBUSINESS NETWORK. MY MATH WE'RE OUT JUST A FEW\nDAYS FOR SUMMER AND THEY'RE ALREADY MAKING UP FOR IT.\n>> YOU LOOK GREAT. >> HORRIBLE HUMAN BEING.\n>> CHARLIE'S GOING TO TAKE YOU TO THE GYM.\nWE WERE TALKING EARLIER. >> I DON'T MESS WITH THEM.\nI LIKE TO JUST DRIVE WITH THEM. ALL RIGHT.\nIN THE MEANTIME, BEFORE THE SWEARING IN, WILL LAME DUCKS IN\nCONGRESS HAVE TAXPAYERS SHELLING OUT?\nYOU SHOULD HEAR WHAT THEY'RE PLANNING.\nAND YOU DON'T KNOW, DO YOU?",

NEWS IS DIFFERENT NOW.\nSO THEY CAN GET THE HEADLINE FROM SOCIAL MEDIA, FROM TWITTER,\nWHAT HAVE YOU. I THINK THEY ABSOLUTELY LIKE TO\nTUNE IN TO SOMETHING THAT GIVES THEM PERSPECTIVE ON THE\nHEADLINE. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING.\nI THINK IT'S VALUABLE AND APPRECIATED.\nI THINK THE PROBLEM GETS IN WHERE OLD-SCHOOL NEWS DOESN'T\nMAKE ROOM FOR THAT DISTINCTION THAT KG LAID OUT, OBJECTIVE\nSTUFF VERSUS ADVOCACY AND THINGS LIKE THAT.\nSO THERE'S CONFUSION. LIKE YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE NOT\nCLEAR ON THAT SEPARATENESS, THEN YOU'RE GOING TO BE CONFUSED.\n>> MEGAN, HOW DO WE DO BETTER? WHAT DOES THE MEDIA NEED TO DO\n-- TO REGAIN THE PUBLIC SFLUFT. >> TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN A GREAT\nMEDIATOR FOR THIS. NOW JOURNALISTS DON'T GET AWAY\nWITH THE SAME THINGS THEY USED TO.\nIF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S ATTENDING A WEDDING OR YOU'RE ATTENDING THE\nWEDDING OF A HIGH PERSON ON THE HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN, I\nCAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO REPORT ON THERE AND THE\nDEMOCRATS IN ANY KIND OF WAY THAT'S NOT COMPLETELY BIASED.\nTHERE'S A LOT OF BACK ROOM LIBERAL MEDIA, DEMOCRAT STUFF\nTHAT GOES ON. I'VE SEEN IT FIRSTHAND, AND\nEVERYONE KNOWS WHO THE PEOPLE ARE.\nCHRIS MATTHEWS, I'M LOOKING AT YOU WITH YOUR TINGLE YOUNG\nPEOPLE LEG. THE GREAT -- TINGLE UP YOUR LEG.\nTHE GREAT THINGS ABOUT TWITTER IS PEOPLE ARE BIASED.\nMAKE THE DISTINCTION, ARE YOU A HARDLINE JOURNALIST OR OPINION\nPERSON? IF YOU ARE HANGING OUT AND HAVE\nA CLOSE PERSONAL FRIEND HIGH UP ON THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN OR\nPRESIDENT OBAMA, MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T BE IN THE INDUSTRY.\n>> THAT'S WHY I HAVE NO FRIENDS. >> STEPHANOPOULOS USED TO WORK\nFOR BILL CLINTON -- >> EXACTLY.\n>> AND DONATED HEAVILY TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\n>> EXACTLY. >> THEY RELY ON HIM TO ASK\nHILLARY CLINTON QUESTIONS ON THE -- AN IMPORTANT SUNDAY MORNING\nTALK SHOW. >> 100%.\nHE MAKES ME INSANE. HE IS CLOSE FRIENDS WITH THEM.\nHE WORKED FOR THEM. HE GAVE MONEY TO THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW I SHOULD\nBE TAKING HIM SERIOUSLY. >> TO BE FAIR, WE HAVE TRUTH IN\nSENTENCING OF TRUMP INTERVIEWING TRUMP HERE.\n>> ABSOLUTELY. >> YES.\nYES. BUT IT'S A LOT MORE EGREGIOUS ON\nTHE LEFT. >> WHAT?\nI DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. >> THERE'S A DISTINCTION WITH\nTHE OPINION SHOWS -- >> RIGHT.\nYOU WATCH, YOU KNOW, BILL O'REILLY, HE STARTS HIS SHOW\nWITH THE TALKING POINTS MEMO. IT IS AN OPINION PIECE.\nTHAT'S WHAT HE DOES. THEN YOU WATCH SEAN HANNITY,\nTHAT IS WHERE OF A CONSERVATIVE COVERING THE NEWS, WE'LL GIVE\nOPINION, AND SHOWCASED.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS IS TRYING\nTO PRESENT HIMSELF AS A NEWSMAN TO EVERYONE.\nTHERE IS A DISTINCT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT AND AN OPINION\nPERSONALITY.

WHAT KIND OF A MARGIN DOES\nIT APPEAR TO YOU THAT DONALD TRUMP WOULD NEED AMONG\nINDEPENDENTS IN ORDER TO PULL THIS ELECTION OUT?\n>> >> THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.\nI THINK HE NEEDS AT LEAST LIKE YOU SAID, ROMNEY WON BY\nA FEW PERCENTAGE POINTS. IS HE GOING TO AT LEAST NEED\nTHAT THIS GOES INTO THE OTHER FACTOR.\nWHICH IS THERE IS AN ENTHUSIASM GAP HERE.\nREPUBLICANS ARE EXCITED ABOUT TURNING OUT TO VOTE.\nAT LEAST A DECENT PORTION OF THEM ARE.\nAND HILLARY CLINTON HAS GOT TROUBLE WITH SOME OF THESE\nMEMBERS OF HER COALITION, PARTICULARLY AMONG\nMILLENNIAL VOTERS WHO AS ENTHUSC ABOUT VOTING FOR HER AS THEY\nWERE FOR BARACK OBAMA IN 2008 AND 2012.\nTHE BASE IS GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT PARTED.\nTHE TURNOUT AMONG THE BASE OF EACH OF THE PARTIES IS\nGOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF WHAT HAPPENS HERE IN\nJUST A FEW WEEKS. >> YEAH.\nI GUESS MRS.

BUT, AGAIN, THIS IS ONE OF\nTHOSE ELECTIONS WHERE, YOU KNOW, SHE HAS ALREADY SPENT\n$150 MILLION AGAINST TRUMP. IT HASN'T SEEMED TO HAVE\nMUCH EFFECT IN THE SAME WAY THAT REPUBLICANS DID THAT IN\nTHE PRIMARY AND IT DIDN'T SEEM TO EFFECT HIM.\nTRUMP DIDN'T HAVE MUCH GROUND GAME IN THE\nPRIMARIES. HE DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE MUCH\nNOW IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE AFFECTING HIM IN THE POLLS\nRIGHT NOW BUT IT RIGHT ON ELECTION DAY.\n>> VERY INTERESTING, TOM. THANKS VERY MUCH.\nTODAY, DONALD TRUMP FINALLY ACCEPTED THE REALITY THAT\nAFTER YEARS OF PUSHING THE IDEA OF PRESIDENT OBAMA IS\nNOT BORN IN THE U.S. IT WAS A NONSTARTER.\nSO TRUMP CONCEDED ON THAT POINT AND HE PUT THE BLAME\nON HIS OPPONENT. WATCH.\n>> HILLARY CLINTON AND HER CAMPAIGN OF 2008 STARTED THE\nBIRTHER CONTROVERSY. I FINISHED IT.\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA WAS BORN IN THE UNITED STATES,\nPERIOD. NOW, WE ALL WANT TO GET BACK\nTO MAKING AMERICA STRONG AND GREAT AGAIN.\n>> HILLARY CLINTON QUICKLY RESPONDED TO TRUMP'S CLAIM\nTHAT SHE AND HER CAMPAIGN WERE BEHIND THE BIRTHER\nMOVEMENT. >> FOR FIVE YEARS HE HAS LED\nTHE BIRTHER MOVEMENT TO DELEGITIMIZE OUR FIRST BLACK\nPRESIDENT. BARACK OBAMA WAS BORN IN\nAMERICA, PLAIN AND SIMPLE. AND DONALD TRUMP OWES HIM\nAND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AN APOLOGY.\n>> CAMPAIGN CARL CAMERON IS HERE IN WASHINGTON TONIGHT.\nIS HE DOWN AT THE HOTEL WHERE NEWLY JUST ABOUT OPEN\nHOTEL THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS BUILT WHERE HE HELD THAT\nEVENT TODAY. TAKE US TO THAT BIRTHER\nCONTROVERSY, CARL, AS THE DECISION WAS MADE TO BACK\nAWAY FROM IT. >> WELL, DONALD TRUMP IS\nTRIKING TO COURT THE VERY INDEPENDENT VOTERS THAT YOU\nWERE JUST TALKING TO TOM ABOUT.\nMODERATES, SWING DEMOCRATS, ET CETERA.\nAND MINORITIES. HE SPENT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT\nOF TIME IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY\nTHE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS. AND, THERE IS FRANKLY A BIT\nOF CEILING FOR HIM THERE SO ONE THE WAYS TO PERHAPS GET\nA LITTLE BIT MORE HEAD ROOM WOULD BE TO DEAL WITH THIS\nISSUE. SO, THE DECISION WAS MADE IN\nTHE LAST TWO DAYS THAT HE WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE THIS\nANNOUNCEMENT. AND IN DOING SO, HE HOPES TO\nPUT IT TO REST. THE CAMPAIGN TRIED TO KEEP\nIT QUIET. TRUMP HINTED THIS MORNING TO\nMARIA BARTIROMO ON FBN THIS MIGHT HAPPEN.\nSOME HAVE SAID THE PRESS CORPS COVERING TRUMP SAID\nTHIS MIGHT BE HAPPENING. WE WERE TOLD AT THE\nBEGINNING OF THE WEEK IT WOULD BE A NEWS CONFERENCE\nIT DIDN'T END UP BEING ONE. HE DIDN'T TAKE ANY QUESTION.\nHE PUT WE THE PRESS IN THE FAR BACK OF THE ROOM.\nSIX ROWS OF 150 PEOPLE IN FRONT OF US.\nEVEN THOUGH AWFUL LOT OF REPORTERS SHOUTED QUESTIONS\nTO HIM IN THE END WE DIDN'T GET ANY.\n>> WHAT EVIDENCE DOES HE HAVE TO BASE HIS CLAIM THAT\nHILLARY CLINTON WAS BEHIND THE -- WAS THE START OF THE\nBIRTHER MOVEMENT? >> WELL, THERE IS NO DOUBT\nTHAT THE ISSUE OF WHETHER BARACK OBAMA, THEN A SENATOR\nIN 2007, WAS BORN IN THE U.S., STARTED WHILE HE WAS\nRUNNING FOR THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION.\nAND THOUGH TO CALL IT EVIDENCE MIGHT BE A BIT OF A\nSTRETCH THERE ARE AT LEAST THREE INSTANCES THAT THEY\nTALK ABOUT THAT WOULD GIVE SOME CREDENCE TO THIS.\nFIRST, MARK PENN, LONG TIME STRATEGIST AND POLLSTER FOR\nBILL AND HILLARY CLINTON WAS HER POLLSTER AND STRATEGIST\nIN 2007 WROTE A MEMO ABOUT A VARIETY OF I THAT THEY\nSHOULD THINK ABOUT IN TERMS OF CASTING HER AS A MORE\nSOFT AND REACHABLE CANDIDATE.\nAND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HE DID SAY WAS THAT BARACK\nOBAMA HAS A LACK OF AMERICAN ROOTS.\nAND HIS BASIC AMERICAN VALUES AND CULTURE ARE, AT\nBEST, LIMITED. AND IN THAT MEMO MARK PENCE\nSAID THAT THEY SHOULD DO NOTHING EXPLICIT ABOUT IT\nAND STAY AWAY FROM IT AND TALK, INSTEAD, ABOUT THEIR\nOWN VALUES. BUT, THERE IS A WRITTEN\nDOCUMENT BY A CLINTON STAFF MENTIONING THIS ISSUE.\n>> CRARM, LET ME INTERRUPT YOU.\nSHE NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT, THIS RIGHT?\nSHE NEVER SAID ANYTHING ON, THIS CORRECT?\n>> NO. NO.\nSHE NEVER DID ANYTHING ABOUT IT.\n>> THAT CAMPAIGN PUBLICLY SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT.\n>> WELL, TWO CASES IN THAT INIT'S.\nPATTY ELISE DOYLE WHO",

WHO BETTER TO ASK IS GARRETT\nTENNEY FROM WASHINGTON, D.C. WITH DETAILS.\nGOOD MORNING, GARRETT. >> GOOD MORNING, Y'ALL.\nI WAS IN A DONALD TRUMP RALLY IN OHIO.\nFIRSTHAND I CAN TELL YOU THAT A LOT OF HIS SUPPORTERS\nARE FULLLY EMBRACING HILLARY CLINTON'S DESCRIPTION OF\nTHEM AS DEPLORABLE. IT'S BECOME ALMOST A BADGE\nOF HONOR FOR THEM. LAST NIGHT AT A RALLY IN\nMIAMI, THE CAMPAIGN CONTINUED TO PLAY THAT UP AS\nWELL WITH A SONG FROM THE BROADWAY MUSICAL LES\nMISERABLE AND AFTER A ROUGH WEEK, THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN\nIS ALSO NOW TRYING TO REIGNITE CONTROVERSY BY\nACCUSING DONALD TRUMP OF INCITING VIOLENCE DURING HIS\nSPEECH LAST NIGHT. THIS COMES AFTER THE DONALD\nTRUMP -- DONALD TRUMP WAS TALKING ABOUT GUN CONTROL IN\nHILLARY CLINTON'S HYPOCRISY FOR WANTING TO TAKE AWAY\nPEOPLE'S GUNS WHILE SHE HERSELF WALKS AROUND ABOUT\nBODY GUARDS 24/7. MANY IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA\nARE JOINING IN AS WELL. CRITICIZING TRUMP FOR IN\nTHEIR WORDS CALLING FOR ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON\nCLINTON. TAKE A LISTEN TO TRUMP'S\nREMARKS FOR YOURSELF THOUGH. >> I THINK THAT HER BODY\nGUARDS SHOULD DROP ALL WEAPONS.\nTHEY SHOULD DISARM. RIGHT?\nRIGHT? I THINK THEY SHOULD DISARM,\nIMMEDIATELY. WHAT DO YOU THINK?\nYES? YES.\nYEAH. TAKE THEIR GUNS AWAY.\nSHE DOESN'T WANT GUNS. TAKE THEIR -- LET'S SEE WHAT\nHAPPENS TO HER. TAKE THEIR GUNS AWAY. AYK EL W VERY DANGEROUS.\n>> WELL, THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN ISSUED A STATEMENT\nSAYING DONALD TRUMP HAS A PATTERN OF INCITING PEOPLE\nTO VIOLENCE. WHETHER THIS IS DONE TO\nPROVOKE PROTESTERS AT A RALLY OR CASUALLY OR EVEN AS\nA JOKE, IT IS UNACCEPTABLE QUALITY IN ANYONE SEEKING\nTHE JOB OF COMMANDER IN CHIEF.\nAFTER A COUPLE OF ROUGH WEEKS, THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN\nIS TRYING TO CHANGE THE NARRATIVE FROM CLINTON'S\nHEALTH AND SCANDALS. LOOK AT THE POLLS AND YOU\nCAN SEE WHY. A COUPLE WEEKS AGO SHE WAS\nBEATING TRUMP NATIONALLY BY 6 POINTS.\nNOW, THAT LEAD HAS SHRUNK TO ONLY A 1.5% IN THE REAL\nCLEAR POLITICS AVERAGE. THE ELECTION 52 DAYS AWAY\nAND THE FIRST DEBATE JUST OVER WEEK FROM NOW.\nTUCKER, ABBY, AND CLAYTON. >> NECK AND NECK IN THOSE\nPOLLS. >> WHAT IS ALEPPO?\n>> LET'S ASK JUAN WILLIAMS IF HE KNOWS WHERE ALEPPO IS.\nCO-HOST OF THE FIVE. HEY, JUAN, GREAT TO SEA YOU\nTHIS MORNING. >> GOOD MORNING.\nI'M IN RAINY PENSACOLA. THIS IS TRUMP COUNTRY DOWN\nHERE IN WEST FLORIDA. >> YOU READ THE \"NEW YORK\nTIMES\" THIS MORNING. THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE IT\nSOUND LIKE TRUMP WAS THREATENING VIOLENCE AGAINST\nHILLARY. AND ANY NORMAL PERSON KNOWS,\nWHETHER YOU AGREE WITH IT OR NOT, THAT HE WAS MAKING A\nPOINT ABOUT HER HYPOCRISY. NO GUNS FOR YOU BUT I GET\nGUNS TO PROTECT MY FAMILY. THAT ANNOYS TRUMP AND A LOT\nOF PEOPLE. WHY PRETEND THAT WAS\nENCOURAGING VIOLENCE WHEN IT CLEARLY WASN'T?\n>> WILL, I THINK THERE IS A LITTLE HISTORY HERE, TUCKER.\nREMEMBER, TRUMP AT ONE POINT SAID THE SECOND AMENDMENT\nPEOPLE COULD TAKE CARE OF THAT AND INTERPRETED AS\nSUGGESTING THAT POTENTIALLY PEOPLE WHO ARE GUN OWNERS\nWOULD DEAL WITH HILLARY IF SHE GOT ELECTED OR SOMETHING\nLIKE THAT. AGAIN, IT WAS A STRETCH\nBECAUSE I THINK IN THAT SITUATION TRUMP REALLY WAS\nTALKING ABOUT THE ACTIVISM OF GUN OWNERS, WHICH IS WELL\nKNOWN IN POLITICAL CIRCLES. THEY ARE VERY STRONG\nACTIVISTS AND ADVOCACY GROUP.\nAGAIN, GIVEN THE VIOLENCE WE HAVE SEEN AT TRUMP RALLIES\nAND ALL THAT, I THINK IT PLAYS UP THAT THEME.\n>> I KNOW, JUAN, THE MEDIA ARE BEING DISHONEST.\nTHEY ARE. THEY ARE ROOTING FOR HILLARY\nAGAINST TRUMP AND DRYING ON PURPOSE TO GET HER ELECTED.\nDON'T THEY UNDERMINE THEIR CREDIBILITY WHEN THEY DO\nTHAT? >> I DON'T THINK THEY ARE\nLYING. I THINK THAT THEY ARE\nPUTTING OUT, YOU KNOW, ONE VERSION OF WHAT PEOPLE FEAR\nFROM DONALD TRUMP. I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, THE\nQUESTION IS DUES IN YOUR ARTICLE OR IN YOUR BROADCAST\nYOU ARE DOING THIS MORNING, LISTEN, A LOT OF PEOPLE\nTHINK DONALD TRUMP IS JUST MAKING THE POINT THAT\nHILLARY CLINTON IS A GUN CONTROL SUPPORTER AND THAT,\nIN FACT, SHE HAS ARMED GUARDS 24/7 AND HAS SINCE\nSHE HAS BEEN FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES.\nLET'S NOT FORGET. SO I THINK PEOPLE APPRECIATE\nTHAT WE GET BOTH SIDES OF IT.\nBUT I DON'T KNOW THAT I WOULD SAY OH THE MEDIA IS\nLYING. >> JUAN, DO YOU THINK THAT\nTHERE IS A CONCERN WITHEN THE CLINTON CAMP THAT THIS\nTHING IS SLIPPING AWAY FROM HER?\nWE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS A LITTLE EARLIER.\nTHIS SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN PREPARING FOR A RUN FOR\nYEARS AND YEARS.OT THE ELECTORAL MATH ON HER SIDE.\nHERE SHE IS GOING UP AGAINST DONALD TRUMP.\nDOESN'T NEARLY HAVE THE GROUND GAME, THE MONEY,\nANYTHING THAT SHE HAS. YOU LOOK AT THE POLLS THAT\nGARRETT TENNEY WAS TALKING ABOUT.\nIT REALLY WAS NECK AND NECK. EVEN HE IS UP IN SOME OF THE\nGSWTAINTE SINCLS GUD THE IM\nATT RT OE STHIOFO. ONE N. ONE POLL UP BY A\nPOINTS. IS THERE A REAL CONCERN\nTHERE THAT THIS MIGHT BE SLIPPING FOR HER?\n>> SO I HAVE BEEN TRAVELING THE LAST FEW DAYS, ABBY.\nI THINK DEMOCRATS AROUND THE COUNTRY ARE COMING DOWN WITH\nMAYBE WHAT WAS GIVING MRS. CLINTON THE SNIFFLES\nLAST WEEKEND. I THINK THEY ARE FEELING A\nLITTLE WEAK IN THE KNEES THERE IF YOU GET MY POINT.\nANXIETY AND DREAD. FOR THE FIRST TIME, YOU HEAR\nPEOPLE SAYING OH MY GOSH, CAN I SEE THAT DONALD TRUMP\nMIGHT WIN THIS THING ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE.\nNOW, YOU KNOW, LET'S BE A LITTLE BIT FAIR HERE AND\nCAUTIOUS. AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S\nGOING ON. THE BASIC ELEMENTS OF THE\nRACE HAS NOT CHANGED. YOU KNOW, IT'S MORE THAT --\nIT'S LESS THAT CLINTON IS LOSING SUPPORT.\nIT'S MORE THAT DONALD TRUMP IS DUANEING SUPPORT.\nESPECIALLY FROM REPUBLICANS WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN, YOU\nKNOW, UNCERTAIN ABOUT WHETHER THEY WERE GOING IT\nSUPPORT HIM. HE IS CONSOLIDATING THAT\nBASE. AND I THINK THAT'S PUSHING\nUP HIS NUMBERS. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE\nELECTORAL MAP THAT YOU REFERENCED, YOU KNOW, SHE\nSTILL HAS AN ADVANTAGE IF YOU LOOK AT THE ELECTION\nMODELS THAT WE IN POLITICS USE.\nSHE IS STILL FAVORED BUT JUST NOT AS MUCH.\nAND THAT'S WHAT'S CAUSING DEMOCRATS TO HAVE A LITTLE\nCASE OF THE SHAKES, EARLY HALLOWEEN FRIGHT NIGHT.\n>> WHAT DOES HILLARY CLINTON NEED TO TOO THEN?\nIF YOU WERE ADVISING HER THE DEBATE JUST A SHORT TIME\nAWAY NOW, ALL EYES ON THAT FIRST DEBATE AND THEN WE\nHAVE TWO MORE AFTER THAT. WHAT WOULD YOU BE ADVISING\nHER TO DO TO STEADY THE SHIP?\n>> WELL, I THINK SHE HAS GOT TO CHANGE THE NARRATIVES,\nWHAT TUCKER WAS TALKING ABOUT EARLIER WHEN HE WAS\nSAYING THERE IS SO MUCH MEDIA BIAS OUT THERE.\nLOOK, SO FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN\nTALKING ABOUT IS MRS. CLINTON'S HEALTH.\nYOU KNOW, AND GOING BACK EVEN TO THE DEPLORABLES\nCOMMENT. WE HEARD GARRETT TALKING\nABOUT HOW THAT'S BECOME A MEME AT TRUMP RALLIES.\nYOU KNOW, TO SUDDENLY YOU HAVE A SHIFT.\nCOULD IT BE THAT PEOPLE NOW START TALKING ABOUT TRUMP\nAND VIOLENCE ON THE GUN THING OR PEOPLE TALKING\nABOUT, OH, WHAT ABOUT TRUMP GOING BACK ON HIS BIRTHER\nCOMMENT? DID HE MEAN IT OR NOT?\nTHIS BRINGS BACK A LOT OF ATTENTION AND NOT POSITIVE\nATTENTION ON TRUMP. THAT BENEFITS THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN. SO, FOR THEM, THEY WANT TO\nGET BACK TO THAT FOCUS ON THE QUESTIONS ABOUT TRUMP'S\nTEMPERAMENT, HIS LEADERSHIP. THEY WANT THE FOCUS THERE\nAND THE SECOND THING IS THAT MRS. CLINTON IS MAKING AN\nEFFORT NOW, INSIDE HER CAMPAIGN VERY CLEARLY\nEMPHASIZING HERE'S WHAT SHE STANDS FOR AS OPPOSED TO\nJUST BEING OPPOSED TO DONALD TRUMP.\n>> SO THE CLINTONS HAVE TAKEN SO MUCH HEAT RECENTLY\nFOR THEIR FOUNDATION AND FOR THEIR RELENTLESS FUNDRAISING\nFOR SPENDING ALL OF LAST MONTH WITH RICH PEOPLE\nRAISING MONEY. IT'S HURT HER.\nI THINK EVERYONE WOULD AGREE, DEMOCRATS AGREE.\nWHAT DO YOU MAKE OF BILL CLINTON'S 70TH BIRTHDAY\nPARTY LAST NIGHT. STAR STUDDED EVENT.\n$250,000 TO BE A PARTICIPANT IN THIS.\nWHY ARE THEY DOING THIS? THIS LOOKS LIKE ADDICTION TO\nME. THEY CAN'T STOP FUNDRAISING\nEVEN WHEN IT HURTS THEM. >> THIS IS SO INTERESTING TO\nME. WHEN YOU TALK TO THE CLINTON\nPEOPLE THERE HAVE A STRONG SENSE THAT THEY ARE BEING\nMALIGNED THAT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION DOES GOOD WORK.\nI DON'T THINK THERE SUSPECT QUESTION THEY HAVE DONE GOOD\nWORK ON H.I.V., MALARIA AND ALL OF THAT WE ARE A\nCHARITY. A HIGHLY RATED CHARITY.\nAND OH, WE ARE GETTING JUST BEATEN UP ON ALL THE\nQUESTIONS. THE FACT IS THAT THE IMAGE\nOF THAT FOUNDATION AND THE POSSIBILITY OF QUID PRO QUO\nDEALS BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO ARE DONORS TO THE FOUNDATION AND\nMRS. CLINTON WHILE SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE JUST IS\nPOLITICALLY TOXIC, TUCKER. IT JUST DOESN'T SIT RIGHT\nWITH LOTS OF PEOPLE. AND, AGAIN, SPEAKS TO THE\nWHOLE VERY DIFFICULT ISSUE OF MRS. CLINTON'S\nTRUSTWORTHINESS AND CHARACTER.\nTHAT'S WHY I THINK IT WAS DONE KIND OF, I WOULDN'T SAY\nIN SECRET BUT ON THE SLY. THAT'S WHY THERE WAS NOT A\nLOT OF PUBLICITY OR ATTENTION.\nAND THE COST OF THE TICKETS OUT THE ROOF.\nYOU WOULD HAVE TO DIG DEEP. >> HILLARY CLINTON DIDN'T\nEVEN GO. >> YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE\nCANDIDATE THERE. >> THEY CAN'T CONTROL BILL\nCLINTON. HE WANTED TO DO IT.\nTHEY COULDN'T TELL HIM. NO HOW DYSFUNCTIONAL.\n>> I WOULD AGREE. >> JUST A BIRTHDAY PARTY.\n>> IT WAS AT CHUCK E CHEESE. >> JUST A CELEBRATION.\nJUAN WILLIAMS, ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU.\nENJOY FLORIDA. >> THANKS, GUYS.\nHAVE A GREAT SHOW. >> COMING UP, THE NATION'S\nLARGEST POLICE UNION JUST ENDORSED A CANDIDATE FOR\nPRESIDENT. WHICH CANDIDATE AND WHY IN\nTHE UNION PRESIDENT IS JOINING US NEXT TO TELL US.\n>> AND THEN THE UNITED NATIONS HAS A NEW PLAN TO\nHELP SAVE PLANET EARTH.

IT IS VERY DISRUPTIVE.\nTHAT IS THE SORT OF THING TO FREAK OUT THE MARKET AND THE\nMARKET HAS BEEN VERY QUIET AND FOCUSSED ON THE WRONG THINGS\nHERE BECAUSE OF IT.

I DON'T THINK IT IS THE RIGHT\nPLACE TO GET OUT OF YOUR APPLE POSITION.\nTO PEEL BACK SEEMS TO MAKE SOME SENSE.\n>> THE INTERESTING THING IS APPLE IS AN INTERESTING STORY\nFOR THE WEEK. IN THE SCHEME OF THINGS THE\nSTORY OF THE LAST FIVE YEARS HAS REALLY BEEN THAT INDIVIDUAL\nSTOCKS DON'T MATTER. THE LAST FIVE YEARS HAS SHOWN\nAMAZINGLY HIGH CORRELATIONS BETWEEN ALL ASSET CLASSES.\nTHE FIXED INCOME, COMMODITY MARKETS ARE TOTALLY\nINTERRELATED. >> THE ONLY EXCEPTION IS APPLE\nIS THE MARKET. IT HAS THE DOW, S&P.\nIT'S THE BIGGEST COMPONENT IN EVERY TECH INDEX.\nWHEN APPLE HAS A REALLY BIG WEEK BECAUSE THEIR LARGEST COMPETITOR\nLITERALLY BLOWS ITSELF UP. IT IS A REFLECTION OF HOW MUCH\nAPPLE CAN LIFT THE MARKETS. >> IS IT SUSTAINABLE?\nCAN YOU SEE THE MOVE GOING FARTHER?\n>> CERTAINLY THE MOVE BECAUSE OF APPLE IS NOT SUSTAINABLE.\nWE ARE SEEING A ROTATION IN THE MARKET.\nTHAT ROTATION IS SO HEALTHY. WE SEE INFRASTRUCTURE STOCKS.\nSOME OF THE LESS INTEREST RATE SENSITIVE MORE INDUSTRIAL NAMES\nPOTENTIALLY TO DO BETTER. DIVIDEND PAYER, MAYBE POTENTIAL\nTO BE WEAKER. THAT IS A HEALTHY ROTATION AND\nMAYBE A SIGN OF POST ELECTION POLICY.\nWE WILL REPATRIOT 2 TRILLION DOLLARS.\nTHAT WILL BE BULLISH FOR THE MARKET.\nTHERE ARE POSITIVE THINGS THAT THE MARKET COULD BE TELLING US\nHERE. >> I WONDER ON THE POLITICAL\nFRONT WE SAW POLLS START TO MOVE AWAY FROM CLINTON TOWARDS TRUMP.\nTHE MEXICAN PESO IS TRADING AT A RECORD LOW.\nWE SEE THE REACTION THERE.

IT IS VERY HARD TO FIGURE OUT\nWHETHER OR IF TRUMP WON WHAT WOULD HAPPEN.\nI THINK IT IS VERY UNPREDICTABLE.\nTHE MARKET FOCUSES ON THINGS THAT THEY CAN PUT INTO THEIR\nEQUATIONS AND ALL ALGORITHMS, THE ONLY VARIABLE WE ARE PLAYING\nWITH IS CENTRAL BANK POLICY. I THINK THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE\nTHE BIG TRIGGER. >> LET'S GO TO LARRY ON THAT\nONE. NOBODY EXPECTS THE FED TO RAISE\nRATES. WOULD IT MATTER TO THE MARKETS\nIF THEY DID? >> IT'S INTERESTING, MANY PEOPLE\nBELIEVE THEY SHOULD HAVE RAISED RATES ALREADY.\nWHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT THE WORLD WE ARE IN AS WE HAVE SEEN\nSOFT ENOUGH ECONOMIC DATA FOR THE FED TO JUSTIFY.\nQUESTIONS ABOUT CONSUMERS AND RETAIL SALES AND DIFFERENT\nMANUFACTURING DATA. AS A RESULT THE FED IS PROBABLY\nON HOLD. THE FED MAY BE ON HOLD THROUGH\nTHE END OF THE YEAR. MAYBE THE MARKET HAS GOTTEN\nCOMFORTABLE WITH THAT. IT KNOWS THAT AFTER THE ELECTION\nIT IS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT GAME. THE FED IS NOT AS POLITICAL AND\nIT IS A DIFFERENT STORY POST ELECTION.\nYOU MAY START TO SEE HIGHER RATES.\nTHAT IS WHY THE MARKET IS REACTING THE WAY IT IS AND WHY\nVOLATILITY IS PICKING UP. >> I THOUGHT THE INFLATION\nNUMBER WAS A GOOD NUMBER TODAY. >> DEFINE GOOD.\n>> FED HAS BEEN SAYING FOR EIGHT YEARS THEY WANT TO SEE MORE\nINFLATION. THEY FINALLY GOT A NUMBER THAT\nSHOWS A LITTLE WHIFF OF INFLATION AND PEOPLE DIDN'T\nCARE. IT'S LIKE WHO CARES.\n>> WE DID SEE PROBABILITY UP FROM 18% TO 20%.\n>> TO ME IT IS NOT REALLY ABOUT SEPTEMBER OR IT WILL PROBABLY BE\nDECEMBER. I DON'T THINK THAT IS WHERE YOU\nSEE REALLY THE INTEREST RATE POLICY I LOOK TOWARDS EUROPE AND\nJAPAN. >> IF WE ARE AT AN INFLECTION\nPOINT ON THOSE CENTRAL BANKS IF THEY REACHED LIMITS OR MAX\nPOTENTIAL WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THAT INFORMATION AS AN INVESTOR?\n>> I AM SITTING ON CASH. I HAVE BEEN SITTING ON THE\nENTIRE YEAR 35% TO 40% IN CASH BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE BONDS.\nI THINK IT IS HORRIBLE RISK/REWARD AND I THINK MOST\nEQUITIES ARE PRICED TO PERFECTION.\nI THINK IT IS EXPENSIVE OVERALL.

I THINK THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE\nSEEING IN BIO TECH ABOUT A NICE BOUNCE OFF THE LOWS.\nNOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT IT.

IS THAT A HEAD WIND TO OVERALL\nMARKET? >> WE ARE SEEING SOME OF THE\nRELATIONSHIPS BREAK DOWN AND RELATIONSHIPS CHANGE.\nTHERE WAS A PERIOD OF TIME WHERE THE MARKET WAS VERY MUCH HELD\nHOSTAGE TO THE OIL MARKET AND CERTAINLY HIGH YIELD BOND MARKET\nWAS HELD HOSTAGE. NOW EVERY OPPORTUNITY THAT\nCREATES ITSELF RIGS GO BACK AND DRILLS GO BACK IN AND MORE OILS\nPUMP. WE TOOK THE PLATEAU.\nIT SEEMS LIKE THE GREAT BEAR MARKET OF ENERGY IS BEHIND US.\nMAYBE WE ARE IN THE RANGE OF GOLD LOCKS ERA WHERE YOU GET\nCHEAP ENERGY NOT ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY MASSIVE CHANGE OR\nEXPENSIVE ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY ALTERNATIVE ENERGY EXPLORATION.\nTHE BOND MARKET REALLY LIKES IT.

BUT HOW MUCH DOES THE SIZE OF\nTHE LINE MATTER FOR THE STOCK? JOSH LIPTON IS AT THE PALO ALTO\nAPPLE STORE WITH ALL THE DETAILS.\nHEY, JOSH. >> Reporter: MELISSA, FANS ARE\nSTILL LINING UP AT THIS STORE HERE IN PALO ALTO BEHIND ME\nWAITING TO GET THEIR HANDS ON THAT NEW iPHONE 7.\nSO THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THOSE LINES TELL US ANYTHING ABOUT\nSTOCK PERFORMANCE. REMEMBER, PIPER'S GENE MUNSTER\nTRACKS LINES AT THE APPLE STORE IN NEW YORK CITY ON 5th AVENUE.\nWE THEN LOOK TO SEE HOW THE STOCK PERFORMS IN THE THREE\nMONTHS FOLLOWING THE RELEASE OF NEW PHONES, AND YOU CAN SEE THAT\nTHE iPHONE 4 SAW A LINE OF 1300 PEOPLE.\nTHE STOCK POPPED 9%. THE iPHONE 5S, SOME 1,400\nPEOPLE, AND A GAIN OF 18%. AND THEN THE BIG ONE, THE iPHONE\n6, NEARLY 1,900 PEOPLE, AND THE STOCK JUMPED SOME 11%, SO IN\nOTHER WORDS, IT LOOKS LIKE SIZE CAN MATTER HERE.\nAS FOR TODAY THOUGH, MUENSTER ESTIMATES THE LINE AT ONLY\nAROUND 400 PEOPLE. SO SHOULD APPLE BULLS BE WORRY?\nMUENSTER DOESN'T THINK SO. FOR ONE HE SAYS CONSUMERS ARE\nINCREASINGLY TRENDING TOWARD PREORDERING TO AVOID LAUNCH\nLINES. ALSO APPLE, REMEMBER, DID\nANNOUNCE YESTERDAY THAT THE iPHONE 7 PLUS UNITS HAD SOLD\nOUT. MUENSTER SAYS HE CONTINUES TO\nLOOK FOR SLIGHT GROWTH IN HIS iPHONE 7 CYCLE.\nOF COURSE, INVESTORS WILL GET A LOT MORE INFORMATION WHEN APPLE\nNEXT REPORTS IN OCTOBER. AT THAT POINT YOU'D EXPECT THE CEO TO ISSUE THAT DECEMBER\nQUARTER GUIDANCE. THAT WOULD BE THE FIRST REAL\nREAD INTO THE HEALTH OF THE NEW iPHONES.\n>> THANK YOU, JOSH LIPTON. DO YOU CARE ABOUT THE LENGTH OF\nTHE LINE? >> I THINK HE SAID SOME REALLY\nIMPORTANT STUFF HERE. THE STOCK HAS HAD 11% MOVE THIS\nWEEK. THERE'S BEEN NO DATA OTHER THAN\nONE THING OUT OF T-MOBILE SAYING THEY'D --\n>> AND SPRINT. >> AND VERIZON AND AT&T DIDN'T\nSAY A WHOLE HECK OF A LOT. >> AND ALSO SAMSUNG.\n>> YOU ABOUT I THINK THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT.\nI THINK EXPECTATIONS WENT FROM VERY LOW TO NOW VERY HIGH.\nI THINK YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO HA THAT PRESS RELEASE APPLE\nRELEASED ON SENT 8th WHEN THEY SAID THEY WERE NOT GOING TO\nISSUE PREORDERS. THEY SAID SALES WILL DEPEND ON\nSUPPLY, NOT DEMAND. >> THEY SAID EXPECTATIONS WERE\nLOW GOING IN BUT NOT MANY ANALYSTS ON THE STREET HAVE\nRISED THEIR PRICE TARGETS, ESTIMATES, OR ANYTHING BASED ON\nWHAT HAS HAPPENED THIS WEEK. ARE THEY JUST GETTING RIGHT\nSIZED AT THIS POINT? >> AND THAT THEY COULD STILL\nUPGRADE -- UP THEIR VALUES -- >> INTO THE QUARTER.\n>> GUY AND I WERE SAYING IT WAS TRAPPED BETWEEN 105 AND 110.\nWE SPOKE ABOUT IT ON MONDAY AND A BREAK OF 105 OR 110 WAS\nPROBABLY GOOD FOR ABOUT $10. WE GOT TO 117ISH ON THE POP.\nMARKETS UNDERSHOOT AND OVERSHOOT.\nI WOULD THINK THAT YOU SHOULD LOCK IN SOME PROFITS IN APPLE\nBECAUSE I DO BELIEVE TO DAN'S POINT IT WAS A SAMSUNG THING.\nIT WAS A COUPLE DIFFERENT HEADLINES BUT THEY'RE STILL\nDEPENDENT ON THE iPHONE AND I DON'T SEE THAT GETTING\nMATERIALLY BETTER GOING FORWARD. >> YOU SOLD APPLE A WHILE AGO.\n>> YEAH. >> WHAT WILL IT TAKE FOR YOU TO\nLOOK AT IT ONCE AGAIN? >> PROBABLY A CHEAPER PRICE\nBECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THE STORY OF APPLE -- WE ALL TALK ABOUT, YOU\nKNOW, THE RELIANCE ON THE PHONE, BUT AS APPLE HAS GONE UP OVER\nTHE LAST COUPLE YEARS, IT WENT FROM RIDICULOUS VALUE TO NOT SO\nRIDICULOUS ANYMORE. AND SO THAT -- TO ME, WE'VE HAD\nPROBABLY A 28% OR 30% MOVE IN THE MULTIPLE.\nTHAT'S BIG. MEANWHILE, THE CASH PILE HAS,\nYOU KNOW, BEEN SPENT ON DIVIDENDS, WHICH IS FINE.\nA GOOD THING TO DO, BUT THE RIDICULOUS VALUATION STORY ISN'T\nTHERE RIGHT NOW. >> RIGHT UP TO THOSE APRIL HIGHS\nSTEVE JUST TALKED ABOUT, SO DOES IT ROLL OVER FROM HERE?\nPROBABLY. I THINK IT COULD TRADE BACK TO\nTHE $108 LEVEL. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TRADE THE\nSTOCK, I GET IT.

I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING TO\nSEPTEMBER. I THINK DECEMBER IS 50/50.\n. WE GET SOME MISSES ON NONFARM\nPAYROLL FOR SEPTEMBER AND AUGUST, THEN DECEMBER IS OFTEN\nTHE TABLE AND THAT'S WHY I THINK YOU WANT TO LOOK BACK AT BOND\nPROXIES AGAIN. >> SO UTILITIES.\n>> YEAH. >> LET'S LOOK AT THE XLU, THE\nETF THAT TRACKS THE UTILITY SECTOR.\nDOWN 7.5% FROM THE 52-WEEK HIGH IT IS MADE IN EARLY JULY.\nI THINK IS SETS UP REALLY INTERESTING INTO THE END OF\nYEAR. I THINK DECEMBER IS ON THE\nTABLE. IF FOR ANY REASON THE ECONOMIC\nDATA DOESN'T SUPPORT IT, THEN YOU WANT TO BE IN SECTORS LIKE\nUTILITIES. SO TODAY WHEN THE XLU WAS\nTRADING AT $49, YOU COULD LOOK OUT TO DECEMBER EXPIRATION AND\nBUY THE 4954 CALL SPREAD PAYING $1.50 FOR THAT, BUYING ONE OF\nTHE DECEMBER 49 CALLS FOR $1.65, SELLING ONE OF THE DECEMBER 54\nCALLS AT 15 CENTS WHEN $1.50 IS YOUR MATCH RISK.\n3% OF THE UNDERLYING ETF PRICE, AND MY TRADE HERE IS REALLY TO\nGET IT BACK UP TO THOSE PRIOR HIGHS AND POSSIBLY GET A BIT OF\nA BREAKOUT. IF THEY DON'T RAISE IN DECEMBER,\nTHIS THING IS GOING THERE. JILD CERTAINLY RATHER BE LONG\nTHAN YUTS THAN BONDS AT THIS POINT.\nI DON'T DISLIKE ALL THE BONDS PROXY.\nTHAT'S THE THESIS BEHIND THE VERIZON TRADE I AM STICKING\nWITH. THEY HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT\nHURT. THIS IS ONE OF THE SITUATIONS.\nALSO JUST TO KEEP THIS IN MIND, TEN YEARS FROM NOW UTILITY RATES\nARE GOING TO BE HIGHER SO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF\nINFLATION ADJUSTMENT COMPONENT THAT GOES INTO SOMETHING LIKE\nUTILITIES THAT YOU DON'T GET IF YOU BUY BONDS.\n>> I HAVE A QUESTION THOUGH. WHATEVER THE FED DOES, WHAT\nWE'VE SEEN THIS WEEK IS THE LONG END OF THE CURVE, THE YIELD IS\nGOING HIGHER. SO IN THAT SCENARIO, DO YOU\nSTILL WANT TO BE IN THESE BOND PROXIES?\n>> IF THIS IS ALL SORT OF A FORWARD LOOKING AND DISCOUNTING\nMEASURE, THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF POSSIBILITY THAT WERE THEY TO DO\nTHAT, THE LONG END IS PRICED A GOOD PIECE OF OR IF NOT ALL OF\nTHIS HUGE 25 BASIS POINTS IN. THAT'S THE ISSUE.\n>> ISN'T A PIECE OF THE FACT THOUGH THAT WE'VE SEEN THAT LONG\nEND GOING UP THOUGH THE FACT WE SAW SOMEWHAT HIGHER THAN\nEXPECTED INFLATION DATA? AREN'T UTILITY RATES IMPACTED --\nTHEY BASICALLY TRACK UP WITH INFLATION.\nSO THE INFLATION COMPONENT ISN'T GOING TO AFFECT THIS SECTOR AS\nMUCH AS IT IS U.S. TREASURY APPROXIMATES.\n>> I ALSO THINK LET'S JUST SAY WE DO HAVE A SCENARIO WHERE\nPEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR DEFENSIVE, THEY'RE LOOKING FOR\nYIELD. THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY\nABOUT THE ECONOMIC DATA. I THINK UTILITIES ALSO WORK IN\nTHAT ENVIRONMENT TOO. AND I AGREE WITH YOU GUYS AS FAR\nAS RATES. THEY'VE ALREADY MOVED UP FROM\nTHAT EPIC LOW IN JULY, AND, THEREFORE, THEY MAY BE\nINCORPORATING ANY SORT OF INCREASE, SO I THINK THIS TRADE\nPROBABLY WORKS OKAY UNDER MOST SCENARIO.\n>> IT'S BEEN A VERY TOUGH WEEK FOR THE U.S. ECONOMY.\nWE HAVE BAD RETAIL SALES WEIGHED DOWN BY THE AUTOS, DECLINING\nPRODUCTION. MICHIGAN SENTIMENT HOLDING AT\nTHE LOWEST LEVEL SINCE APRIL. AND CARTER SAYS THERE'S ONE\nRISKER THAT COULD BE AT RISK. WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING?\n>> I'M LOOKING AT INDUSTRIALS. THIS IS A SITUATION OF AN AREA\nTHAT IS BOTH GOOD AND BAD, BUT IT'S GOOD FOR THE WRONG REASONS,\nAND LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I'M TRYING TO MAKE BY THAT POINT.\nTHIS IS THE SECTOR INDUSTRIALS AS MEASURED BY THE ETF THAT\nMATCHES THE S&P 500. WHAT YOU CAN SEE CLEARLY IS THAT\nIT WAS ABLE TO EKE OUT A SLIGHT NEW HIGH BEFORE TURNING DOWN.\nBUT IT'S ALL ABOUT RELATIVE PERFORMANCE, MEANING YOU COULD\nHAVE PUT YOUR MONEY INTO THIS, BUT AS SOMEONE MANAGING MONEY,\nYOU HAVE UNDERPERFORMED THE ALTERNATIVE, AND THE ALTERNATIVE\nIS THE MARKET ITSELF. SO YOU HAVE THIS VERY BAD AND\nCONSISTENTLY FAILING AT THIS RELATIVE DOWN TREND LINE FOR THE\nLAST TWO, THREE YEARS. SO EVEN AS THIS SECTOR WAS GOING\nUP, IT'S UNDERPERFORMING THE MARKET, AND SOME OF THAT IS\nSOFTENING, AND I WOULD THINK THIS IS A PLACE TO NOT BE.\nI WANT TO MAKE THE BET THAT THIS IS GOING LOWER AND BE SHORT THE\nXLI. SO DRAW YOUR LINES.\nI THINK THAT'S A DECENT WAY TO DRAW THE LINES.\nAN UPTREND AND I'M THINKING HERE THAT WE'RE GOING TO BREAK BASED\nON THE HEAVY VOLUME AND THE WAY THIS CAME DOWN.\nYOU HAVE A GAP HERE, AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY MAKE IT\nTO A NEW LOW. NOW, THE LONG-TERM.\nTHIS BREAK, IF WE WERE TO BREAK THAT TREND LINE, RIGHT HERE,\nTHEY TALK ABOUT MEGA PHONES. THEY DON'T ALWAYS PLAY OUT BUT\nTHEY OFTEN DO. IF WE WERE TO SORT OF PLAY OUT\nLIKE THAT, THIS PROJECTS QUITE A BIT LOWER.\nI'M A SELLER OF INDUSTRIALS AND I WOULD DO IT THROUGH XLI.\n>> FROM A BIGGER PICTURE STANDPOINT, MIKE, IT'S SORT OF\nTHE SAME DIRECTIONAL TRADE AS DAN'S.\nIT'S SORT OF THE BELIEF THAT THINGS ARE BAD, SO THEREFORE THE\nECONOMY IS BAD, INDUSTRIALS WILL BE BAD.\n>> WE OFTEN SOUND LIKE THIS, DON'T WE?\nBUT WE CAN ONLY TELL YOU WHAT THE DATA GIVES US, AND THE DATA\nISN'T ALL THAT COMPELLING. LOOK AT THE BIGGEST CONSTITUENTS\nOF THE XLI. A LOT OF THESE COMPANIES ARE\nPROBABLY 20% ABOVE THEIR HISTORICAL VALUATIONS.\nTHOSE THAT ARE NOT MIGHT HAVE INVOLVED HISTORICALLY SOME KIND\nOF A SUPER CYCLE LIKE CAT. THERE'S PROBABLY ONLY ONE NAME\nON THE LEAD PAGE OF XLIs CONSTITUENT STOCK THAT IS I\nLIKE, AND THAT'S BOEING. AND IT'S THE ONLY ONE -- BUT YOU\nCAN'T BUY THAT ETF BASED ON THAT.\nSO I'M WITH CARTER ON THIS. NORMALLY I WOULD, AND IN FACT,\nWE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS, WHEN VOLATILITY IS LOWER, I GO OUT\nAND BUY A PUT BUT WE HAVE SEEN A BUMP UP IN IMPLIED VOLATILITIES.\nTHE BEST WAY TO PLAY THIS IS TO LOOK OUT TO DECEMBER AND BUY THE\n5651 PUT SPREAD. YOU CAN PAY $1.15.\nBUYING 51 FOR $1.75. SELLING THE STRIKES AGAINST IT\nFOR 60 CENTS. THAT'S LESS THAN A QUARTER OF\nTHE DISTANCE FOR THE STRIKES. WE'LL LET THE DECAY OF THAT OUT\nOF THE MONEY OPTION. IT'S NOT GOING TO COST YOU A LOT\nIN DECAY AS WE PROGRESS. >> THIS TRADE MAKES SENSE.\nYOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE COMPONENTS OF THE XLI.\nGE IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST, AND THEY HAVE MORE THAN 55% OF THEIR\nSALES COME FROM OVERSEAS. DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TODAY?\nTHE DOLLAR MOVED UP IN A MEANINGFUL WAY.\nORACLE WAS DOWN ALMOST 4%. THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE\nADVERSE EFFECTS OF THE DOLLAR. I KNOW THAT SOUNDS SO LAST YEAR,\nOKAY, BUT IT STILL IS A BIG THING.\nSO THIS IS A SECTOR THAT IS OBVIOUSLY VERY EXPOSED TO\nDOLLAR, AND I THINK THAT WHEN YOU GET EARNINGS IN THE NEXT\nMONTH OR SO THIS COULD BE AN ISSUE.\n>> THAT'S DEFINITELY A GOOD POINT.\nCERTAINLY TRUE FOR TELECOMS. THEY DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH\nEXPOSURE. >> EVEN TODAY JUST DAY TO DAY\nTHE MARKET WAS ABLE TO KIND OF CLIMB OFF THE LOW.\nTHIS SECTOR CLOSED ON THE ABSOLUTE LOW.\nRELATIVE PERFORMANCE MATTERS. NOT GOOD ACTION.\n>> ALL RIGHT. WE'VE GOT A NEWS ALERT HERE ON\nTWITTER'S NFL STREAMING NUMBERS FROM LAST NIGHT'S GAME.\nLET'S GET TO JULIA BOORSTIN IN L.A.\nJULIA? >> THE NFL REPORTING THAT A\nTOTAL OF 2.1 UNIQUE VIEWERS CHECKED OUT ITS FIRST LIVE\nSTREAMING GAME ON TWITTER LAST NIGHT, BUT TO COUNT AS UNIQUE\nVIEWER YOU JUST HAD TO WATCH FOR AT LEAST THREE SECONDS.\nNOW, CBS SAYS A TOTAL OF 15.7 MILLION VIEWERS VIEWED ACROSS\nALL PLATFORMS INCLUDING IT'S BROADCAST NETWORK.\nWHEN IT COMES TO THAT TWITTER VIEWING, THE AVERAGE AUDIENCE\nWATCHING WAS JUST 243,000 WITH EACH VIEWER WATCHING AN AVERAGE\nOF 22 MINUTES OF THE GAME. NOW, TO PUT THAT IN CONTEXT, FOR\nTHE OPENING GAME OF THE NFL LAST THURSDAY NIGHT, NBC REPORTED\nOVER 25 MILLION VIEWERS AND ONLINE NBC SPORTS DIGITAL\nREPORTED 1.2 MILLION UNIQUE VIEWERS AND A 278,000 AVERAGE AUDIENCE PER MINUTE.\nNBC DIGITAL PROPERTIES HAD MORE PEOPLE WATCHING AT ONE TIME\nWHILE TWITTER HAD MORE PEOPLE CHECK OUT THE STREAM OVERALL.\nTWITTER'S TOTAL NUMBER WAS LESS THAN 1% OF ITS TOTAL LOGGED IN\nUSER BASE. WE'LL HAVE TO SEE HOW MUCH\nRATINGS GROW FOR THE NECK GAME OR IF IT HAS ANY IMPACT ON THE\nNUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO LOG INTO TWITTER.\n>> JULIA BOORSTIN, THANK YOU. DAN, TWITTER BOWL.\nWAS THIS GOOD? >> I THINK IT'S GREAT.\nI WAS IN A CAB. THE SECOND HALF I WATCHED IT IN\nTHE CAB ON MY iPHONE. I GOT HOME, I TURNED ON APPLE TV\nAND OPENED THE APP. IT WAS FABULOUS, IT WAS\nSEAMLESS, AND REALLY WELL DONE. LIKE JULIA SAID, I THINK IT WILL\nCATCH STEAM AND I THINK IT'S AN INFLECTION POINT.\nTHEY USE IT FOR SPORTS, FOR POLITICS.\n>> THINKING ABOUT SPORTS, I MEAN, THE NFL, BUT IMAGINE IF\nYOU HAD COLLEGE GAMES ON THIS. IMAGINE IF YOU WERE STREAMING\nTHAT UT/NOTRE DAME GAME WHICH WAS THE MOST WATCHED COLLEGIATE\nFOOTBALL GAME IN HISTORY, I THINK THIS THING WOULD CATCH\nFIRE. I LOVE IT.\n>> WOW. >> LET'S JUST SAY THIS --\n>> DID IT COME UP ON YOUR STAR TACK LAST NIGHT?\n>> EXACTLY. BUT, I MEAN, THE BURDEN OF PROOF\nIS ON THE BEAR. LOOK AT THE LAST TWO YEARS.\nIF YOU'RE GOING TO GET BETTER, SHOW ME.\nFOR NOW -- >> COULDN'T YOU SAY THAT THE\nBURDEN -- WHEN THE STOCK GETS TO THE MIDTEENS, INVESTORS BUY IT,\nAND I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT, SO I THINK YOU HAVE A\nFEW DOLLARS OF DOWNSIDE EVEN IF THEY HAVE A BAD Q3.\nTHAT'S WHERE YOU BUY IT. >> GOT A QUESTION OUT THERE,\nSEND US A TWEET.

I THINK IT'S WORTH A PLAY.\nTHAT SAID, THE MARKET HASN'T REALLY BEEN LOVING IT.\nSO I THINK THE WAY TO PLAY THIS IS ACTUALLY USING A CALL SPREAD\nRISK REVERSAL. THE ONE I'M LOOKING AT IS THE\nNOVEMBER 145 1SHTION 55, 1 6 5. YOU YOU SELL THE 165s AGAINST IT\nFOR $1.25 AND ALSO THE 145 PUTS FOR ABOUT $2.85.\nNET NET YOU'RE PAYING BETWEEN 50, 60 CENTS.\nIT'S ESSENTIALLY NOTHING WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT TO OWN A $10\nSPREAD. THE STOCK GOES UP 6%, YOU WILL\nMAKE 10 BUCKS. FOR YOU TO LOSE 10 BUCKS, IT HAS\nTO DROP TO 135. THAT'S A DECLINE OF OVER 13%.\nOBVIOUSLY IF IT FLOATS AROUND BETWEEN THE 145 STRIKE OF THE\nPUT THAT YOU SOLD AND THE 155 CALL THAT YOU BOUGHT, NO HARM,\nNO FOUL. >> WHAT DO YOU THINK?\nI LIKE THE TRADE STRUCTURE.

THEY SPLIT LAST YEAR.\nSOMETHING HAS TO HAPPEN HERE WITH IBM.\nIF YOU REALLY THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE SOME SORT OF CORPORATE\nACTION WHERE THEY SPLIT THIS UP AND FOCUS ON THE FASTER GROWING\nBUSINESSES.

I THINK YOU CAN DO THAT VERY\nEASILY. OIH HAS BOUNCED A LITTLE BIT.\nLOOK AT THE OCTOBER 2825 PUT SPREAD.\nSPENT 95 CENT TO PUT THAT TRADE ON.\n>> SO WHAT NOW? >> STICK WITH IT.\n>> STICK WITH IT.

BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY THING\nPROPPING UP THE MARKET RIGHT NOW.\nTHE MARKET GOES DOWN AND PEOPLE SAY, MY GOSH, WE DON'T HAVE\nJOBS, WE AREN'T EARNING ANYTHING, WE CAN'T AFFORD HOMES.\nAND NOW WE SEE OUR 401(k)S SHRINK.\nI THINK TRUMP IS A SHOE-IN THEN FOR THE PRESIDENCY.\n>> AND, KATIE, PEOPLE OFTEN MAKE UP THEIR MINDS WAY IN ADVANCE ON\nHOW THEY FEEL ABOUT THE ECONOMY. AND THIS HAS BEEN THE WORST\nRECOVERY SINCE AT LEAST 1949. >> WELL, RIGHT.\nAND YOU COUPLE THAT WITH HILLARY CLINTON ESSENTIALLY RUNNING TO\nBE PRESIDENT OBAMA'S THIRD TERM AND SHE'S GOING TO HAVE A MAJOR\nPROBLEM IF THE FED DECIDES TO HIKE RATES.",

LOOK AT THIS.\nWHEN TRUMP TRY TO DEFLECT BLAME FOR DEANYING THAT HE WAS BORN IN\nAMERICA HE IS LYING. THE BIRTHER LIE IS WHAT TURNED\nTRUMP FROM AN ORDINARY TV STAR. THAT ORIGIN STORY CANNOT BE\nUNWRITTEN. TRUMP HAS SPENT YEARS SPED LING\nA RACIST CONSPIRACY UNDERMINING THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN\nPRESIDENT.

CAN YOU TELL ME WHY YOU THINK\nBIGOTRY AND RACIAL BIGOTRY IS AT THE HEART OF THIS CLAIM THAT THE\nPRESIDENT IS SECRETLY FOREIGN? CAN YOU TELL ME WHY THAT IS?\n>> WELL, WHEN YOU TRY TO DELEGITIMIZE THE FIRST AFRICAN\nAMERICAN PRESIDENT I DON'T BELIEVE DONALD TRUMP HAS DONE\nTHIS TO ANYONE ELSE IN THE PAST. I DON'T REMEMBER ANYONE TRYING\nTO DELEGITIMIZE ANY PRESIDENT. HE IS RALLYING THE FORCES THAT\nHAVE BEEN INSIDIOUS BUT HE HAS ALLOWED RACE TO BE SWEPT FROM\nUNDER THE RUG. THERE ARE THOSE IN THIS COUNTRY\nWHO REALLY BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR, PEOPLE WHO DESERVE TO\nBE HERE AND DESERVE TO LIVE THE AMERICAN DREAM JUST LIKE THEY\nDO, THEY DON'T WANT THEM HERE. DONALD TRUMP HAS JUST ALLOWED\nTHE PRESIDENCY OF OUR FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN PRESIDENT HE\nHAS PLAYED ON THIS TO REALLY SURFACE.\nMANY OF THE NEGATIVE RACIST ATTITUDES THAT STILL HAVE NOT\nBEEN ADDRESSED IN OUR COUNTRY. A HEALING PROCESS SHOULD TAKE\nPLACE. IT WILL TAKE A WHILE.\nWE ARE SEEING EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH IN THIS\nCOUNTRY. DONALD TRUMP IS THE LEADER OF\nTHIS MOVEMENT. AGAIN, HE NEEDS TO APOLOGIZE.\nHE NEEDS TO APOLOGIZE TO SECRETARY CLINTON FOR TRYING TO\nBLAME HER. CAN YOU IMAGINE TRYING TO TURN\nTHIS AROUND NOW? TO TRY TO SAY HE IS FINISHING\nSOMETHING SHE STARTED? IF THE PUBLIC DOES NOT\nUNDERSTAND IT IS SOMEONE WHO WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR\nNATIONAL SECURITY, YOU KNOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE AMERICA WOULD\nALLOW THIS TO GO DOWN. >> YOU KNOW, TODAY WATCHING YOU\nAND SO MANY MEMBERS OF THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CONGRESS\nTALK ABOUT THIS IN MANY CASES WITH A LOT OF EMOTION, WATCHING\nMICHELLE OBAMA TALK ABOUT THIS WITH SOME EMOTION TODAY,\nWATCHING SECRETARY OF STATE TODAY TALK ABOUT THIS BEFORE\nTHAT HUGE AUDIENCE OF AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN AT THE CONFERENCE\nSHE WAS AT IN D.C., I FOUND IT VERY MOVING IN TERMS OF THIS\nBEING A RACIAL FAULT LINE, THIS BEING A RACIST INSULT IN THE WAY\nTHAT PEOPLE HAVE BASICALLY STEPPED UP AND BEEN WILLING TO\nCALL IT THAT. I WONDERED, THIS HAS BEEN OUT\nTHERE AND AROUND THERE FOR A LONG TIME.\nEVERYBODY HAS KNOWN THAT IT IS A RACIST THING FAR LONG TIME.\nOVER THE COURSE OF THIS ELECTION, OVER THE COURSE OF THE\nTIME IT HAS BEEN IN THE NEWS, HAVE ANY OF YOUR COLLEAGUES EVER\nREACHED OUT AND SAID HEY, POLITICS ASIDE WE DON'T LIKE\nTHIS STUFF EITHER OR I DON'T LIKE THIS STUFF EITHER?\nHAVE YOU EVER HAD THOSE KIENTD OF CONVERSATIONS IN PRIVATE?\n>> NO. I REALLY HAVEN'T.\nYOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO REMEMBER, NOW, OTHER TIMES THAT\nREPUBLICANS HAVE TRIED TO REALLY DELEGITIMIZE PRESIDENT OBAMA.\nONE CALLED HIM A FOOD STAND PRESIDENT.\nTHAT'S COLD, RIGHT? ANOTHER MEMBER OF CONGRESS STOOD\nUP AND SAID YOU LIED YOU CAN GO BACK AND THE CREDIBILITY TO MOVE\nFORWARD AND RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY YOU HAVE\nSYSTEMATICALLY SEEN THIS BUILD UP.\nTHERE IS A LONG HISTORY REALLY ATTEMPTING.\nLOOK AT WHAT THEY DID IN TERMS OF NOT SUPPORTING THE PRESIDENT\nIN THE RECOVERY ACT, NOT PROVIDING HEALTH CARE FOR THOSE\nTHAT DON'T HAVE HEALTH CARE MITCH McCONNEL SAID THEY WANTED\nTO MAKE SURE IT WAS A ONE-TERM PRESIDENT.\nYOU CAN SEE AND LOOK AND GO BACK TO WHAT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE\nBEEN DOING DURING THE TIME THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS BEEN\nPRESIDENT AND HE HAS DONE -- THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE AN\nUNBELIEVABLE JOB IN SPITE OF THE OBSTRUCTIONIST CONGRESS.\nSO DONALD TRUMP FELT LIKE HE HAD THE LEGITIMACY AND BACKING TO BE\nWHO HE IS. THIS IS WHO HE IS.\nHE NEEDS THE APOLOGIZE HE NEEDS TO LET THE COUNTRY KNOW THIS IS\nNOT THE AMERICAN WAY. THIS IS REALLY UN-AMERICAN. IT WOULD BE A GREAT MEMBER.\nHI SAID THIS CAMPAIGN SHOULD BE REALLY A REFERENDUM ON BIGOTRY.\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF STRUGGLE AND MOVEMENTS IN THIS\nCOUNTRY AGAINST RACISM, SEXISM, AGAINST ALL OF THE INJUSTICES\nTHAT WE ARE STILL ADDRESSING, THERE HAVE BEEN MOMENTS OF YOUNG\nPEOPLE, PEOPLE OF COLOR, PEOPLE OF CONSCIENCE.\nEVERYONE HAS COME TOGETHER TO PUT FORWARD CANDIDATES THAT\nREALLY WANT TO STOP THIS AND TRY TO CREATE A WORLD WORTHY OF OUR\nCHILDREN. ONCE AGAIN, HE SHOULD APOLOGIZE\nTO THE PRESIDENT AND HE SHOULD APOLOGIZE TO SECRETARY CLINTON.\nWE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD AND MAKE SURE THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS WE\nHAVE ONE CHOICE COME NOVEMBER IF WE WANT TO MAKE SURE OUR COUNTRY\nMOVES FORWARD AND GIVES PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE THE\nAMERICAN DREAM AND THAT'S TO VOTE FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHAT'S THE ONLY THING. I THINK TODAY WAS A DEFINING\nMOMENT WHICH WILL HOPEFULLY LET PEOPLE KNOW WHO HE IS.\nWE HAVE KNOWN WHO HE IS FOR MANY YEARS.\n>> BARBARA LEE, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TONIGHT.\nTHANK YOU. I KNEW I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU\nTONIGHT. >> THANK TALK WITH YOU.\n>> THANK YOU, RACHEL. >> IF THERE'S ANY DOUBT ABOUT\nTHIS BIRTHER ISSUE HAS FIRED UP CORE SUPPORTERS OF HILLARY\nCLINTON, LET THAT PUT IT TO REST, RIGHT?\nWE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.",

I WAS LISTENING TO THE NEWS\nCONFERENCE WITH CBC FOLKS, WORDS I JOTTED DOWN DISGUSTING, FRAUD,\nARROGANT, BIGOT, DISRESPECTFUL, RACIST.\nDO YOU -- DOES THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN AGREE WITH ALL OF THOSE\nWORDS, ALL OF THOSE ADJECTIVES. >> THIS BIRTHER MOVEMENT WHICH\nDONALD TRUMP USED TO ESSENTIALLY PUT HIMSELF ON THE POLITICAL MAP\nIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS JUST THE LATEST IN A PATTERN OF\nBIGOTED COMMENTS AND BEHAVIOR FROM DONALD TRUMP THROUGHOUT HIS\nLIFE. IF YOU LOOK BACK IN THE 1970s\nWHEN HE WAS FIRST GETTING HIS START IN NEW YORK REAL ESTATE HE\nWAS SUED BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT FOR NOT RENTING\nAPARTMENTS IN HIS BUILDINGS TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS LIVING IN NEW\nYORK CITY. JUST LOOK AT THE COMMENTS HE'S\nMADE THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN. I THINK BACK TO WHEN HE DEMEAN\nADD FEDERAL JUDGE BORN IN INDIANA BASED ON THAT JUDGE'S\nMEXICAN AMERICAN DESCENT. THE REALITY IS DONALD TRUMP\nINSULTS EVERYBODY, EVEN THE MEDIA TODAY.\nHE INSULTED THE MEDIA'S INTELLIGENCE BY CONVENING THIS\nPRESS CONFERENCE UNDER FALSE PRETENSES THEN USING VETERANS AS\nA HUMAN SHIELD TO DEFLECT FROM THIS ISSUE OF THIS BIRTHERISM\nCONTROVERSY. AND THEN HE TOOK THE PRESS ON A\nTOUR OF HIS HOTEL. AGAIN, TRYING TO USE THIS\nPRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN TO PROMOTE HIS PRIVATE BUSINESS INTERESTS\nAND REFUSED TO ALLOW REPORTERS TO TRAIL WITH HIM AND ASK HIM\nFOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS. I THINK HE'S OUTRAGED AND\nINSULTED EVERYBODY TODAY. >> DO YOU CONSIDER HIM A LIAR,\nFLAT OUT A LIAR? >> ABSOLUTELY.\nHE'S POLITIFACT'S 2015 LIAR OF THE YEAR.\nTHEY MEASURED THAT 70% OF HIS STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN FACT\nCHECKED AS FALSE, MOSTLY FALSE OR PANTS ON FIRE.\nTHIS IS A GUY WHO -- HE'S INCORRIGIBLE.\nAND HE HAS NO SHAME WHATSOEVER AND TODAY HE WENT OUT AND\nATTEMPTED TO TELL A LIE ABOUT THE ORIGINS OF THIS BIRTHERISM\nMOVEMENT. HIS CAMPAIGN AND HE ARE TRYING\nTO TAKE CREDIT. THEY HAVE THE GAL AND TEMERITY\nTO SUGGEST THEY WERE DOING THE PRESIDENT A FAVOR BY FINALLY\nADMITTING IN THE FINAL MONTHS OF THIS PRESIDENT'S TENURE THAT HE\nYES, INDEED, WAS BORN IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AFTER\nDELEGITIMIZING HIM FOR THE FIRST SEVEN PLUS YEARS OF HIS\nADMINISTRATION. I THINK HE'S OFFENDED -- GO\nAHEAD, SORRY. >> I KNOW HE'S OFFENDED AND WE\nHAVE LISTED OUT THE MYRIAD GROUPS IN THIS COUNTRY AND\nBEYOND WHO HE HAS BUT I WAS LISTENING TO DANA BASH A MOMENT\nAGO. SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT SOME URBAN\nAREAS THERE'S BEEN A LACKING OF ENTHUSIASM FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nI WAS IN A BARBERSHOP IN ATLANTA TALKING TO FOLKS AND SOME PEOPLE\nJUST WEREN'T QUITE SURE IF THEY WERE GOING TO VOTE ON THE\nNATIONAL LEVEL. I'M WONDERING IF WHAT HAPPENED\nTODAY WITH TRUMP HOW IT'S SO NOT OVER.\nIF IT BACKFIRED AND IF YOU THINK IN THE END THIS IS A WIN FOR\nDEMOCRATS, THAT THIS WILL ENERGIZE SPECIFICALLY\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS TO VOTE FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\n>> WELL, ANY TIME THAT THIS TYPE OF HATE-FILLED BIGOTRY IS\nPROMOTED TO THE LEVEL OF THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT\nOF THE UNITED STATES I THINK IT'S A BAD THING FOR OUR COUNTRY\nSO I HESITATE TO CALL ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED TODAY A WIN BUT\nTHERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE POLITICAL STRATEGY BACKFIRED ON\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN LITERALLY IN THE MOMENTS BEFORE THIS PRESS\nCONFERENCE WAS HELD THERE WERE REPORTS THAT ON BACKGROUND TRUMP\nAIDES, HIS CAMPAIGN STAFF WAS SAYING THESE COMMENTS WERE GOING\nTO TAKE THIS ISSUE OFF THE TABLE IN ORDER FOR HIM TO NOT BE\nCONFRONTED ON IN THE THE FIRST DEBATE HAPPENING LATER THIS\nMONTH. GEE, I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW THEY\nTHINK THIS ISSUE IS GOING TO GO AWAY.\nI THINK IT WILL BE TALKED ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME AND WE HAVE TO\nCOME TOGETHER AND SAY THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE AND THIS MAN IS\nUNFIT TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\n>> ONE MORE FOR YOU BRIAN. I MENTIONED HARRY REID, NANCY\nPELOSI WAS ON CNN TODAY SAYING FLAT OUT, GUARANTEEING DONALD\nTRUMP WILL NOT BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nDO YOU TAKE THAT VERY SAME VIEW POINT?\n>> WE HAVE TO WORK HARD IN THESE NEXT TWO MONTHS.\nWE CAN NOT TAKE ANYTHING FOR GRANTED.\nLOOK AT THE POLLS THAT HAVE COME OUT THIS WEEK.\nFOR EVERYTHING HE HAS SAID, THIS RACE IS EXTREMELY CLOSE.\nTHERE ARE A LOT OF AMERICANS JUST TUNING INTO THIS RACE AND\nTHEY'RE NOT AWARE OF THE THINGS DONALD TRUMP HAS SAID.\n>> WHY CAN'T YOU GUARANTEE IT BASED UPON EVERYTHING YOU JUST\nTOLD ME ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TODAY AND HIS PAST?\n>> THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES WHEN IT COMES TO PRESIDENTIAL\nELECTIONS IN THIS COUNTRY.

              "text": "THAT'S OLD NEWS.\n>> IT'S BEEN 16 MONTHS, BRUCE. >> YEAH, BUT, YOU KNOW, IT\nHASN'T -- PRESIDENT OBAMA'S NOT RUNNING FOR THE PRESIDENT OF --\nHILLARY CLINTON IS. >> 16 MONTHS.\n>> I NOTICE WHEN -- EVERYONE SAYS THAT, WELL, WE ASKED\nHILLARY CLINTON THAT DID YOU -- WELL, NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT.\nWE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME PERSON THAT HAS TEN DIFFERENT\nSTORIES ON E-MAILS, WHO HAS THE REPUTATION OF THE AMERICAN\nPEOPLE OF NOT BEING TRUTHFUL. >> TRUST ME, WE'RE TALKINGIING T\nTRUTHINESS ABOUT BOTH OF THE CANDIDATES BUT TODAY WE'RE\nTALKING TRUMP, BAKARI, JUMP IN, PLEASE.\n>> I THINK TODAY DONALD TRUMP GAVE THREE STATEMENTS.\nHE SAID THAT HILLARY CLINTON STARTED THE BIRTHER MOVEMENT,\nWHICH IS A LIE. HE THEN STATED THAT BARACK OBAMA\nWAS BORN IN AMERICA, WHICH IS HE ACKNOWLEDGED A FACT, THEN HE\nSAID NSOMEHOW THAT HE FINISHED THE BIRTHER MOVEMENT WHEN IN ALL\nHONESTY IT FINISHED IN 1961 WITH THE BIRTH OF BARACK OBAMA.\nFOR MES THAT SLAP IN THE FACE, A SPIT IN THE FACE TO MANY\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND GOOD HEARTED PEOPLE.\nDONALD TRUMP PUT FORTH A WHOLEHEARTED EFFORT TO\nDISENFRANCHISE AND DELEGITIMIZE THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I DON'T NEED HIM TO TELL ME\nBARACK OBAMA WAS BORN IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, IT WAS\nTHE UTMOST DISRESPECT BUT MY FEAR, THOUGH, BROOK, AND WHAT\nI'M HAVING TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING ARE THOSE PEOPLE OF GOOD SPIRIT,\nTHE WHITE AMERICANS WHO STILL SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP EVEN\nUNDERSTANDING HIS XENOPHOBIC AND BIGOTED LANGUAGE.\nI BELIEVE IT'S NOT A MAJORITY. I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S MANY BUT WE\nHAVE TO WAIT UNTIL NOVEMBER 8 TO SEE IF THAT BEARS.\n>> CARL, I KNOW YOU WERE ON A COUPLE DAYS ASKING AND YOU WERE\nASKED DO YOU BELIEVE PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS BORN IN THE UNITED\nSTATES AND YOUR RESPONSE WAS \"PROBABLY.\"\n>> YEAH. >> WHAT'S YOUR ANSWER TODAY?\n>> STILL PROBABLY. I MEAN, I BELIEVE -- IF DONALD\nTRUMP HAS PUT IT TO BED, DONALD TRUMP HAS PUT IT TO BED.\n>> BUT IT'S NOT PUT TO BED FOR YOU?\n>> I JUST DON'T CARE ANYMORE. >> THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN\nNOT CARING AND SAYING PROBABLY. >> WELL, I REALLY DON'T CARE.\nAND I THINK THE MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC DOESN'T CARE.\nTHE DEMOCRATS CAN SAY IT'S A BIG, BIG ISSUE.\nJUST BECAUSE THEY SAY IT DOESN'T MEAN IT WILL.\nFOR SEVEN YEARS THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN SAYING \"DONALD TRUMP\nHAS TO PUT THIS THING TO BED.\" THEN HE FINALLY PUTS IT TO BED\nAND SAYS YEAH HE WAS BORN IN AMERICA, NOW THEY COMPLAIN THAT\nHE SAID THAT. THIS SHOWS IT'S A POLITICALLY\nPARTISAN ISSUE. >> FIVE YEARS LATER, CARL\nHIGBIE. FIVE YEARS LATER AND YOU DID\nCARE BEFORE. >> THEY WERE COMPLAINING ABOUT\nIT FOR FIVE YEARS. AND NOW HE'S SAID LOOK, ALL\nRIGHT, GUYS, I CONCEDE HE WAS BORN IN AMERICA, LET'S MAKE\nAMERICA GREAT AGAIN. >> BUT HE FUELED THE THEORIES.\nHE WAS THE OX ZWROEN THE FIRE. >> YEAH, SURE HE FUELLED IT.\nSO HE GOT HIS INFORMATION, NOW HE'S DECIDED THAT BARACK\nOBAMA -- IN HIS MIND HE DECIDED BARACK OBAMA WAS LEGITIMATELY\nBORN IN AMERICA, LET'S MOVE ON. WHO CARES.\n>> HANG ON, THIS APPLIES TO BOTH HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD\nTRUMP, WE TALK ABOUT JUDGMENT, WE TALK ABOUT CHARACTER AND WHEN\nYOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP WHO ASKED AT ONE POINT IN TIME FOR HARVARD\nTO RELEASE PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PRESCRIPTIONS THEN YOU HAVE WHAT\nHE CALLED FOR WHICH HE SORT OF TRIUMPHS IS THAT ULTIMATELY THE\nWHITE HOUSE HAD TO GO TO HAWAII AND GOT THE LONG FORM BIRTH\nCERTIFICATE. THEN YOU JUST POSE THE THAT WITH\nTHE REST OF IT ALL WHICH IS THE FACT THAT HE HASN'T RELEASED HIS\nTAX RETURNS WHEN YOU TALK TRANSPARENCY.\nHE HASN'T RELEASED DETAILED MEDICAL RECORDS OTHER THAN ONE\nSHEET FROM HIS DOCTOR. HOW IS THAT FAIR?\n>> WELL, TWO THINGS, FIRST OF ALL, MITT ROMNEY DIDN'T RELEASE\nHIS TAX RETURNS UNTIL A MONTH BEFORE --\n>> I'M NOT ASKING ABOUT MITT ROMNEY.\n>> WELL, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BARACK OBAMA SO WE CAN TALK\nABOUT MITT ROMNEY, TOO, I THINK. THE FACT IS QUESTION NEED TO\nLOOK AT -- DONALD TRUMP IS UNDER AUDIT.\nLET'S SAY HE RELEASES HIS TAX RETURNS AND THE AUDIT SAYS --\n>> A, WHERE'S THE PROOF? B, THE IRS HAS MADE IT CLEAR YOU\nCAN RELEASE TAX RETURNS IF YOU'RE BEING AUDITED.\n>> YOU CAN, SURE. BUT HE DOESN'T WANT TO HAVE TO\nDEAL WITH THE FALLOUT OF MAYBE HE FILED SOMETHING INCORRECTLY\nTHEN THEY BEAT HIM OVER THE HEAD WITH IT.\nSO HE'LL WAIT TO THE AUDIT IS DONE.\nTELL BARACK OBAMA TO TELL THE IRS TO SPEED THIS THING UP AND\nHE'LL GET THOSE TAX RETURNS OUT. >> I'M LAUGHING.\nI'M LAUGHING. THAT'S GOOD.\nTHAT'S GOOD. SIMONE, I'M LOOKING AT YOU,\nYOU'RE SHAKING YOUR HEAD. I WANT TO HEAR YOUR VOICE BUT\nI'M CURIOUS. YOU HEARD CONGRESSMAN\nBUTTERFIELD BRING UP THE POINT WHERE HE SAID HE DIDN'T THINK\nTRUMP WOULD HAVE QUESTIONED MITT ROMNEY, CARL BROUGHT UP MITT\nROMNEY SO I'LL BRING UP MITT ROMNEY.\nHE DIDN'T HI HE WOULD ASK MITT ROMNEY TO PROVE HE WAS BORN IN\nTHE U.S. OR FOR JOHN McCAIN IS THAT CORRECT?\n>> I AGREE. I DEFINITELY THINK THAT'S TRUE,\nBROOKE, WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THERE'S A HEAVY RACE ELEMENT\nINTO WHAT DONALD TRUMP HAS DONE WITH THIS BIRTHERISM.\nHE HAS ENGAGED IN RACIST RHETORIC AND BIGOTED LANGUAGE\nAND WE'RE WRESTLING WITH THE ISSUE OF RACE.\nYOU HAVE FOLKS THAT ARE -- >> BECAUSE YOU GUYS KEEP\nBRINGING IT UP. >> PARDON ME, BRUCE, DID ANYBODY\nINTERRUPT YOU? I'M SPEAKING.\nDONALD TRUMP IS THE PERSON THAT BROUGHT THIS UP.\nHIS TOOK PLACE THE \"WASHINGTON POST\" --\n>> HE NEVER BROUGHT RACE UP INTO THE BIRTHER IRV SHOE.\nYOU DID. >> BRUCE, BLACK PEOPLE IN THIS\nCOUNTRY, PEOPLE OF COLOR, MEXICANS, HISPANIC, NATIVE\nAMERICANS, WE CAN BE THE MOST EDUCATED FOLKS IN THE ROOM, THE\nMOST KNOWLEDGEABLE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM, THE MOST BRILLIANT BUT THE\nMOMENT WE GET IN CHARGE OF SOMETHING SOMEBODY -- IT SEEMS\nSOMEONE IS ALWAYS QUESTIONING IF WE DESERVE TO BE THERE, IF WE\nARE LEGITIMATELY TAKING OUR PLACE AND THIS IS WHAT IS AT THE\nROOT OF WHAT DONALD TRUMP'S COMMENTS WERE ABOUT PRESIDENT\nOBAMA SO THIS IS DEFINITELY AN ISSUE AND I KNOW REPUBLICAN\nPUNDITS AND COMMENTATORS WHERE GOING TO GET UP HERE AND MAKE IT\nSEEM AS THOUGH IT'S NOT BUT THIS IS ABOUT THE HEART OF OUR\nCOUNTRY. THIS IS NOT ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS\nAMERICANS AND I THINK THIS IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE A TOPIC\nOF NOTE, WE'LL HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THAT AT THE DEBATE BECAUSE\nDONALD TRUMP IS RUNNING TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES\nOF AMERICA, THE PRESIDENT OF BLACK PEOPLE, THE PRESIDENT OF\nMEXICAN AMERICANS, THE PRESIDENT OF HIS PPANIC FOLKS, NATIVE\nAMERICANS, JUST LIKE HE QUESTIONED PRESIDENT OBAMA'S\nLEGITIMACY OF THE UNITED STATES, HE QUESTIONED JUDGE MARK CURIEL\nBECAUSE OF HIS HERITAGE THAT HE WAS MEXICAN, HE COULD NOT BE A\nJUDGE IN THIS CASE. THIS IS AN ISSUE.\n>> BRUCE I WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU BUT ONE OF THE QUESTIONS BROUGHT\nUP AT THIS CBC -- CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS -- WAS THE FACT\nTHAT BOTH HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP ARE IN WASHINGTON\nTODAY, THAT WAS GROUP TODAY CALLED THE BLACK WOMEN'S AGENDA,\nI THINK IT'S 21 DIFFERENT GROUP, THEY WERE ALL TOGETHER.\nSHE ADDRESSED THIS CROWD AND WE KNOW DONALD TRUMP WAS INVITED TO\nAND HE DID NOT ATTEND. DO WE KNOW WHY?\n>> I DON'T KNOW. BUT I WILL TELL YOU THIS,\nBROOKE, I REPRESENT THE NATIONAL DIVERSITY COALITION OF TRUMP, WE\nARE THE LARGEST DIVERSITY COALITION IN THE HISTORY OF ANY\nREPUBLICAN CANDIDATE. THIS HAS BEEN ONGOING SINCE LAST\nYEAR WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SUPPORTERS IN OUR\nORGANIZATION YOU CAN GO TO NDCTRUMP.COM.\nWE REPRESENT INDIAN AMERICANS FOR TRUMP, HISPANIC AMERICANS\nFOR TRUMP, MUSLIM AMERICANS FOR TRUMP, AFRICAN-AMERICAN PASTORS\nFOR TRUMP, THE LIST GOES ON AND ON.\nBUT I WANT TO MAKE THIS REALLY STRONG POINT RIGHT HERE SINCE\nWE'RE ON THIS BLACK RACE DEAL HERE DONALD J. TRUMP HAS NEVER,\nEVER -- YOU CANNOT FIND ANYTHING THROUGHOUT IN THE LAND ON THIS\nPLANET OR THIS UNIVERSE OF HIM SAYING ANYTHING RACIALLY\nDEROGATORY TOWARDS AFRICAN-AMERICAN PEOPLE PERIOD.\n>> THAT IS -- I'M SORRY, BROOK THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE.\n>> WHOA, WHOA, WAIT EXCUSE ME. >> IT'S DEROGATORY TO QUESTION\nTHE LEGITIMACY OF THE FIRST BLACK --\n>> I DIDN'T INTERRUPT YOU. >> IT'S DEROGATORY TO SAY\n\"THAT'S MY AFRICAN-AMERICAN OVER THERE.\"\n>> EXCUSE ME, INTERRUPT YOU. PLEASE LET ME FINISH.\n>> GO RIGHT AHEAD. >> SO TO TAKE THIS BIRTHER\nMOVEMENT AND MAKE IT RACIAL IS ABSOLUTELY PREPOSTEROUS, IT'S A\nFRAUD, IT HAS NO LIFE TO IT. BROOKE, THE REASON WHY THIS IS\nCOMING UP RIGHT NOW IS DONALD TRUMP IS GAINING SIGNIFICANTLY\nIN POLLS AND TOUCHING THE HEART AND SOUL OF THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nPEOPLE IN THESE COMMUNITIES AND THE SPECIAL INTEREST GROUP THAT\nYOU JUST HAD ON THE AIR EARLIER THAT SOME ARE TIED TO PACS JUST\nLIKE HARRY REID IS TIED TO SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS, HIM\nSAYING THESE NEGATIVE THINGS ABOUT MR. TRUMP, ALL OF THIS\nSTUFF IS ABOUT TO COME TO PASS. THIS STUFF HAS GOTTEN SO\nINFECTED ON REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRAT SIDE AND THE BEST THING\nWE CAN DO IS TRY TO PUT RACE INTO THIS AND MARRY THIS BIRTHER\nMOVEMENT INTO IT WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE ON DONALD J.\nTRUMP. >> CAN I SAY SOMETHING FROM THE\nCAMPAIGN PERSPECTIVE? >> GO AHEAD.\n>> FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF SOMEONE WHO HAS WORKED ON MANY\nCAMPAIGNS, YES, THE POLLS ARE VERY CLOSE AND THEY'RE TIGHT AND\nDONALD TRUMP IS UP IN SOME PLACES AND THERE HAVE BEEN MANY\nPOLLS THAT HAVE COME OUT THAT SAID LOTS OF DIFFERENT\nCONSTITUENCY GROUPS ARE NOT NECESSARILY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT\nWHAT WE'RE SEEING ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE SO IT MAKES ZERO\nSENSE FOR DONALD TRUMP TO HAVE BROUGHT UP AND SPOKEN ABOUT THE\nBIRTHER MOVEMENT ESPECIALLY FROM THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE.\nTHIS IS A GALVANIZING JOLT TO THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, FOR\nRACRACIST  BALLOT.\nWE'LL KEEP TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE.\nTHIS DOCTOR L DRAG DONALD TRUMP DOWN SO THE ASSERTION AND NOTION\nTHAT THIS IS A PLOY BY THE DEMOCRATS TO DRAG RACE INTO THIS\nBECAUSE, YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT DOING -- NO, DONALD TRUMP DID\nTHIS HIMSELF. THIS IS BAD CAMPAIGN, DONALD\nTRUMP IS UNFIT TO BE PRESIDENT AND HE NEEDS TO CONSULT WITH HIS\nCAMPAIGN FOLKS. >> BROOKE, BROOKE --\n>> HANG ON BACARRI. I WANT TO COME IN TO YOU IN A\nSECOND. IT LOOKS LIKE OUR SIGNAL WENT\nOUT WITH YOU FOR A SECOND. CARL, I WANT TO ASK YOU AS I WAS\nWATCHING MR. TRUMP TODAY WITH THE VETERANS AT HIS HOTEL.\nI TALKED TO BRIAN FALLON FROM THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN, HE\nREFERRED TO THOSE VETERANS THAT DESERVE TO BE HONORED THAT MR.\nTRUMP USED THEM AS HUMAN SHIELDS.\nYOU ARE THE VETERAN, YOU ARE THE FORMER NAVY SEAL ON THE PANEL SO\nI WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT THAT. YOUR RESPONSE FOR THEM TO BE\nCALLED HUMAN SHIELDS. >> I DON'T THINK IT'S THE RIGHT\nTHING TO BE CALLED HUMAN SHIELDS.\nKEEP IN MIND BOOK, THE PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF AND ME IN THE\nMILITARY, AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY WHO ARE VOTING FOR\nDONALD TRUMP ARE WILLING TO CAST OUR VOTE BECAUSE WE TRUST HIM\nWITH OUR LIVES. WE KNOW AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE HE\nCOULD SEND US TO WRITE A BLANK CHECK UP TO AND INCLUDING OUR\nLIFE. WE STAND IN FRONT OF HIM.\nIF THEY WANT TO CALL US HUMAN SHIELDS, FINE.\nI'D PREFER NOT TO BE CALLED BY THAT BUT BUILD A HUMAN SHIELD\nFOR DONALD TRUMP. >> GO AHEAD, BAKARI.\n>> THERE WAS A LOT TO DIGEST AND UNPACK IN THIS CONVERSATION WE\nHAVE AND I DON'T WANT TO NECESSARILY GOO GO INTO WHAT\nBRUCE WAS TALKING ABOUT, THE ISSUES OF RACE AND RACISM IN\nDONALD TRUMP'S HISTORY AND PAST WHETHER OR NOT HE WAS TALKING\nABOUT AFRICAN-AMERICANS BEING LAZY OR TAKING AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nPEOPLE OFF HIS FLOOR, DISCRIMINATION IN HOUSING, THE\nLIST GOES ON AND ON SO I DARE NOT HAVE TO REPEAT THAT AGAIN.\nBUT CARL MADE A POINT EARLIER TODAY OR ATTEMPTED TO MAKE A\nPOINT WHICH IS JUST NOT TRUE. YOU CAN'T COME OUT AND SAY HE\nPUT THIS TO BED. YOU CAN'T SAY OH, WE GOT BEYOND\nTHIS. >> SO WHAT DO YOU WANT THEM TO\nDO. >> YOU SIMPLY CAN'T JUST GET\nBEYOND RACISM AND SAY \"OH, MY GOD, I SAID HE'S BORN IN\nAMERICA\" WITHOUT ANSWERING WHY DID YOU THINK HE WASN'T BORN IN\nAMERICA IN THE FIRST PLACE? WHY DID YOU PROPAGATE THIS FOR\nFIVE YEARS? IS AND THEN THE LAST QUESTION\nTHAT I REALLY WANT DONALD TRUMP TO ANSWER IS WHY DON'T YOU HAVE\nTHE HEART, SINCE YOU WANT TO BE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, WHY DON'T\nYOU HAVE THE HEART TO APOLOGIZE TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES AND THE MANY PEOPLE WHO LITERALLY STOOD ON STREET\nCORNERS WITH SIGNS THAT SAID \"I AM A MAN\" BECAUSE THEY WANTED\nTHEIR RESPECT IN THIS COUNTRY. DONALD TRUMP IS A COWARD BECAUSE\nHE CAN NOT DO THAT. AND MY LAST POINT THAT I WANT TO\nMAKE IS WE'VE HAD THESE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT TAXES AND\nCARL WENT ON THIS LITANY AND IT WAS REALLY CUTE ABOUT WHAT\nDONALD TRUMP SHOULD DO WITH HIS TAXES BUT IF DONALD TRUMP IS\nUNDER AN AUDIT, DONALD TRUMP SHOULD SHOW THE AUDIT LETTER.\nTHAT'S FIRST. AND SECOND DONALD TRUMP SAID HE\nWENT UNDER AN AUDIT IN 2008, SO DONALD TRUMP SHOULD SHOW HIS\nTAXES UP UNTIL 2008 SO WE CAN BE CUTE ALL YOU WANT BUT DONALD\nTRUMP IS OUT OF EXCUSES, OUT OF EXCUSES WITH AFRICAN-AMERICANS\nAND THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. >> I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU\nFOR THE CONVERSATION. APPRECIATE IT BRUCE AND CARL AND\nBAKARI AND SIMONE, THANK YOU. >> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.\n>> WE NEED TO GET TO THE FIRST LADY, MICHELLE OBAMA.\nSHE IS HITTING THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL FOR HILLARY CLINTON\nMOMENTS FROM NOW. LIVE PICTURES, FAIRFAX,\nVIRGINIA, THERE. WE WILL TAKE YOU TO THE FIRST\nLADY MOMENTARILY. >>> COME SUNDAY, WILL YOU ROOT\nFOR \"GAME OF THRONES,\" \"THE AMERICANS\" MAYBE \"MR. ROBOT.\"\nTHE EMMY AWARDS WILL BE SPEECH, ALL 61 WORDS OF IT.\nTHE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FINALLY ADMITTING AFTER YEARS OF PUSHING\nTHIS DECEPTIVE CONSPIRACY THEORY THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA INDEED WAS\nBORN IN THE UNITED STATES. BUT DID TRUMP APOLOGIZE?\nNO. DID HE EXPLAIN WHY HE CHANGED\nHIS MIND? NOPE.\nDID HE FALSELY BLAME HILLARY CLINTON FOR STARTING THE RUMOR\nIN THE FIRST PLACE? YES, HE DID.\n>> HILLARY CLINTON AND HER CAMPAIGN OF 2008 STARTED THE\nBIRTHER CONTROVERSY. I FINISHED IT.\nI FINISHED IT, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA WAS BORN IN THE UNITED STATES, PERIOD.\nNOW WE ALL WANT TO GET BACK TO MAKING AMERICA STRONG AND GREAT\nAGAIN. THANK YOU.\nTHANK YOU VERY MUCH. [ APPLAUSE ]\n>> IN ADMITTING THE TRUTH, TRUMP OFFERED UP TWO MORE FALSEHOODS.\nFIRST, HE DID NOT \"FINISH IT,\" AS HE SAID.\nHE FED INTO THE CONTROVERSY THREE YEARS AFTER PRESIDENT\nOBAMA FIRST SHOWED HIS BIRTH",

AND WHEN YOU DOVE TAIL WITH THAT\nWITH HIS MESSAGE ABOUT MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN THAT IS WHY\nTHIS IS OFFENSIVE. >> THE MESSAGE OF HE IS NOT ONE\nOF US BEGAN WITH THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN.\nBEFORE EVERYONE GOES CRAZY. >> I DON'T WANT TO RELITIGATE\nTHAT RIGHT NOW. >> THE WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF\nSAID IT BEGAN WITH SID BLUMENTHAL WHO ASKED --\n>> OKAY. SINCE YOU BROUGHT IT UP I WILL\nGIVE YOU A CHANCE TO RESPOND. -- CLOSE CLINTON ADVISOR SAID\nSID BLUMENTHAL PERSONALLY CALLED HIM TO PITCH THIS STORY.\n>> I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S THAT'S ABOUT.\nHILLARY CLINTON DID NOT DO IT. --\n>> -- [ INAUDIBLE ]\n>> -- SHE HAS NOT QUESTIONED WHETHER OR NOT THE PRESIDENT AT\nUNITED STATES -- >> SHE --\n>> SHE DID -- [INAUDIBLE]. >> THE FAK OF THE MATTER IS\nDONALD TRUMP PERPETUATED THIS MOVEMENT IS A PRECURSOR TO HIS\nCAMPAIGN, WHICH IS NOT AT ALL INCLUSIVE.\nSO WHEN -- SO IF THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS WANTS\nTO GET UP THERE AND SAY THIS MAN IS RACIST, HE'S BIGOTED.\nLET HIM DIFFUSE THAT. AND SO FAR HE HAS NOT.\n>> JUST A MOMENT AGO SPEAKING ON THAT STAGE WITHIN THE PAST HOUR\nDONALD TRUMP TALKED SPECIFICALLY ABOUT PEOPLE SAYING HE'S A\nRACIST AND HERE IS WHAT HE SAID ABOUT IT.\n>> -- THE RACIST WORD, IT IS THE OLDEST PLAY IN THE DEMOCRATIC\nPLAY BOOK AND AMERICANS HAVE HAD INFORM OF IT.\nWE GET IT. WE GET IT.\n>> HE'S SAYING AS THE CARD. THEY ARE PLAYING THE CARD ON\nHIM. >> THIS IS SO LUDICROUS TO ME.\nE WE INVITED HIM TO COME AND SPEAK AT THE NAACP.\nHE REFUSED TO COME. WE ALSO INVITED MR. TRUMP TO\nCOME IN ATTACK TO THE BLACK WOMEN'S AGENDA THIS MORNING,\nTODAY. WE WERE HERE.\nWE WANTED TO HEAR FROM HIM. MRS. CLINTON, MY CANDIDATE,\nACCEPTED THE INVITATION. WHY WOULD MR. TRUMP NOT COME TO\nTHESE VERY, VERY, VERY IMPORTANT MOMENTS WITH AFRICAN AMERICAN\nPEOPLE WHERE HE CAN CONTINUE TO ENGAGE THEM?\nIF HE LOVES US IF HE WANTS US TO VOTE FOR HIM, THEN WHY DOESN'T\nHE COME WHERE WE ARE? HE WAS JUST IN FLINT A FEW DAYS\nAGO AND AGAIN HE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT THE\nWATER CRISIS THERE. INSTEAD HE BEGINS TO BASH MRS.\nCLINTON WITH THIS BIRTHER ISSUE. HE HAD TO BE STOPPED BY AN\nAFRICAN AMERICAN PASTOR. HE DOES NOT RESPECT US.\nHE DOES NOT HONOR US AND HE DOES NOT COME NEAR US TO SPEAK TO US\nAND ENGAGE US. THAT IS WHY WE CONTINUE TO SAY\nTHAT HE OPERATES AS A RACIST. >> THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING WITH\nME. NEXT DONALD TRUMP SAYS HE CAN'T\nRELEASE TAXES BECAUSE HE'S UNDER AUDIT.\nIS HE? AND MICHELLE OBAMA HITS THE\nCAMPAIGN TRAIL AND IS SHE NOW THE SECRET WEAPON FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON?",

LET'S START WITH TRUMP'S\nSTATEMENT ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S SECURITY DETAIL,\nDISARMING. WHAT'S BEING MADE OF THAT\nSTATEMENT AND THE INSISTENCE THAT CLINTON WANTS TO DO AWAY\nWITH THE SECOND AMENDMENT, SOMETHING THAT IS NOT TRUE.\nSHE'S DENIED THAT CONSISTENTLY. >> Reporter: YES, IT APPEARS\nTHAT DONALD TRUMP ECHOED SOME OF THE CONCERNS OR COMMENTS OR\nOPINIONS OF MANY OF HIS SUPPORTERS WHO DO SEEM TO\nBELIEVE THAT HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO DO AWAY WITH THE SECOND\nAMENDMENT. YET ALLOWS HER SECURITY DETAIL\nTO HAVE GUNS THEMSELVES. THE TRUTH IS, THE FORMER\nSECRETARY DOES NOT WANT TO DO AWAY WITH THE SECOND AMENDMENT,\nAND SHE IS NOT TRYING TO TAKE GUNS FROM EVERYONE.\nSHE WANTS IT TO BE MORE DIFFICULT FOR SOME PEOPLE TO GET\nGUNS AND BELIEVES THAT SOME PEOPLE, LIKE SECURITY DETAILS\nFOR PEOPLE SEEKING ELECTED OFFICE, SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO\nGUNS AND KEEP PEOPLE SAFE. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BIRTHER\nMOVEMENT. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN\nPROVEN FALSE MANY TIMES. AND IN THIS CASE, YOU BLOW UP\nTHE BALLOON, YOU POP IT, AND YOU BLAME SOMEONE ELSE FOR BLOWING\nUP THE BALLOON. DONALD TRUMP SAYING THE ACTUAL\nWORDS THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS BORN IN THE\nUNITED STATES, BUT HE IS BLAMING CLINTON FOR STARTING IT.\nTHAT IS FACTUALLY INACCURATE. COULD THIS HURT HIS LOYAL\nSUPPORTERS BY SAYING THOSE WORDS, OR, IN FACT, COULD IT\nGIVE HIM AN OPENING TO THESE AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS?\nAS YOU KNOW, HE'S BEEN REACHING OUT TO VOTERS LOOKING FOR THEIR\nSUPPORT. >> Reporter: I THINK ONE THING\nWE DO KNOW IS THAT DONALD TRUMP'S FACE IS NOT GOING WITH\nHIM. THEY WILL BE WITH HIM, AS HE'S\nSAID, UNTIL THE END OF I HAD CAMPAIGN AND POSSIBLY LATER.\nREGARDING HIS DESIRE TO WIN MORE MINORITY VOTERS, SPECIFICALLY\nBLACK VOTERS, THIS ISSUE IS JUST ONE OF MANY THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR\nHAVE FOUND PROBLEMATIC WITH DONALD TRUMP.\nSO EVEN IF THIS WAS A START, IT'S A VERY SMALL START.\nAND HE HAS MUCH FARTHER TO GO. AS YOU SAW YOU YESTERDAY,\nMEMBERS OF THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS' POLITICAL ACTION\nCOMMITTEE THOUGHT HIS RESPONSE WAS INSUFFICIENT AND WANT AN\nAPOLOGY. I DON'T THINK RIGHT NOW IT LOOKS\nLIKE THERE WILL BE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN A VIEW ON DONALD\nTRUMP, AT LEAST FROM BLACK LAWMAKERS.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM THE CONGRESSIONAL\nBLACK CAUCUS ON DONALD TRUMP'S 180.\nA SWIFT RESPONSE. LET'S LISTEN.\nWE'LL TALK ABOUT IT ON THE OTHER SIDE.\n>> DONALD TRUMP IS NOTHING MORE THAN A TWO-BIT RACIAL ARSONIST.\n>> DONALD TRUMP IS DOING EVERYTHING THAT HE CAN TO\nDIVIDE. HE'S A HATER.\nHE'S A BIGOT, AND HE'S A RACIST. >> TRUMP HAS ACTED IN A WAY THAT\nSUGGESTS HE'S A BIGOT. >> BY ANY DEFINING, DONALD TRUMP\nIS A DISGUSTING FRAUD. >> WE WILL NOT ELECT A CHIEF\nBIGOT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\n>> NOT A GLOWING SET OF REACTIONS COMING FROM THE\nCONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS. AGAIN, WE ARE SEEING DONALD\nTRUMP PIVOT AND MAKE THIS OUTREACH TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS.\nHE'S VISITED CHURCHES, HE'S SPOKEN MORE DIRECTLY TO THOSE\nVOTERS. I WANT YOU TO ALSO LOOK AT THE\n-- THIS NEW POLL THAT CAME OUT, THE CBS/\"NEW YORK TIMES\" POLL\nTHAT SHOWS HILLARY CLINTON WITH 8 % OF SUPPORT WHEN IT COMES\nFROM AFRICAN-AMERICANS. 6% FROM DONALD TRUMP.\nIF YOU COMPARE THAT TO PREVIOUS POLLS, YOU COULD SAY THAT DONALD\nTRUMP HAS GONE UP SOME DEGREE. EUGENE, THE QUESTION FOR YOU --\nTHESE LATEST MOVES BY DONALD TRUMP, COULD THIS INDEED HELP\nHIM GAIN SOME GROUND? >> Reporter: THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN\nIS CERTAINLY HOPING SO. I WAS ACTUALLY AT A TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN EVENT THIS WEEK AT THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS, AND\nONE OF HIS SPOKESPEOPLE, KATRINA PEARSON, MADE IT CLEAR THAT THEY\nARE PAYING ATTENTION TO THE POLLS AND DO SEE ROOM FOR GROWTH\nAND FOR MOVEMENT WITH BLACK VOTERS.\nAS WE SAW, THE POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE FROM THE BLACK CAUCUS,\nWHICH HAS ENDORSED HILLARY CLINTON, WANTS TO MAKE IT CLEAR\nTO THEIR CONSTITUENTS AND PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT THEM THAT THEY\nBELIEVE THAT DONALD TRUMP IS NOT THE BEST PERSON FOR PRESIDENT\nFOR BLACK VOTERS. >> THE FIRST DEBATE IS SET FOR\nSEPTEMBER 26th. IT'S NOT TOO FAR AWAY.\nWHEN WE SEE DONALD TRUMP TALKING ABOUT THE BIRTHER ISSUE, FOR\nINSTANCE, IS HE TRYING TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES BEFORE HE\nGETS ON THAT DEBATE STAGE? AND WHAT ALSO ARE WE HEARING\nABOUT HILLARY CLINTON AND HER PREPARATION?\n>> Reporter: I WOULD IMAGINE THAT PUTTING THIS ISSUE TO REST\nTHE WAY HE DID WOULD HELP DONALD TRUMP GET PAST THAT ISSUE ON THE\nDEBATE STAGE. BUT I THINK THE FACT THAT HE\nGAVE SUCH A BRIEF RESPONSE WILL PRESENT OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE\nQUESTIONS, NOT JUST FROM MODERATORS BUT FROM HIS\nOPPONENT, AS WELL. AND SO I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED\nIF IT STILL COMES UP AT THE NEXT DEBATE OR DEBATES AFTER THAT.\nAS FAR AS HILLARY CLINTON'S PREPARATION, WE REPORTED THAT\nSHE IS RESEARCHING DEEPLY NOT ONLY DONALD TRUMP'S POLICY\nPOSITIONS BUT YOU HIS PERSONALITY AND HOW HE HAS\nRESPONDED TO ATTACKS FROM HIS RIVALS IN THE PRIMARY AND THINGS\nTHAT IRK HIM. I THINK WE CAN EXPECT HILLARY\nCLINTON TO MENTION THOSE AND POKE AT DONALD TRUMP A BIT TO\nAGITATE HIM. >> WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE.\nTHE DEBATE NOT FAR AWAY. CNN POLITICS REPORTER EUGENE\nSCOTT LIVE IN WASHINGTON. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY.\n>> Reporter: THANK YOU.",

HILLARY CLINTON IS BACK ON THE\nCAMPAIGN TRAIL FOR ONE EVENT TODAY.\nCLINTON AND PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL SPEAK AT THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK\nCAUCUS DINNER HERE IN WASHINGTON TONIGHT.\nTHE DINNER WILL BE FRIENDLY TERRITORY FOR CLINTON AND SHE'S\nEXPECTED TO HIT DONALD TRUMP, AGAIN, FOR FINALLY ADMITTING\nTHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS BORN IN THE UNITED STATES.\nTHE DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS OF THE BLACK CAUCUS TORE INTO DONALD\nTRUMP FRIDAY CALLING HIM A RACIST AND DEPLORABLE IN A\n40-MINUTE PRESS CONFERENCE. MEMBERS DEMANDING AN APOLOGY\nFROM TRUMP FOR QUESTIONING OBAMA'S CITIZENSHIP.\n>> DONALD TRUMP IS NOTHING MORE THAN A TWO-BIT RACIAL ARSONIST.\n>> DONALD TRUMP IS DOING EVERYTHING THAT HE CAN TO\nDIVIDE. HE'S A HATER.\nHE'S A BIGOT AND HE'S A RACIST. >> TRUMP ACTED IN A WAY THAT\nSUGGESTS HE'S A BIGOT. >> BY ANY INFORMATION TRUMP IS A\nFRAUD. >> WE WILL NOT ELECT A CHEAP\nBIGOT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\n>> ALL RIGHT. SO, THAT SETS THE STAGE,\nPERHAPS, FOR WHAT SHOULD BE AN INTERESTING EVENING.\nMY NEXT GUEST IS SOMEONE WHO WILL ATTEND THE CONGRESSIONAL\nBLACK CAUCUS TINNER AND HAS BEEN FOR THE PAST 30 YEARS.\nAN INCREDIBLE COMMITMENT. SHE WAS A FORMER AMBASSADOR.\nGOOD TO SEE YOU. >> THANK YOU.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME. >> HILLARY CLINTON, AS SECRETARY\nOF STATE NOMINATED YOU TO THAT POSITION OF PRESIDENT OBAMA\nAPPOINTED YOU ALSO AND HIS ADMINISTRATION AND YOU WORKED\nFOR PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON. >> RIGHT.\n>> YOUR COMMITMENT IS DEEP, IT IS STRONG.\n>> IT'S VERY DEEP. IT'S VERY STRONG.\nIT'S CONSISTENT. WHAT AN HONOR TO WORK FOR THE\nFIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT.\nTHE SENTIMENTS ARE WHAT MANY OF US FEEL.\nTHE CAUCUS WAS PACKED YESTERDAY LED BY HONORABLE GREGORY MEEKS.\nDONALD TRUMP SHOULDN'T HAVE STARTED IN THE FIRST PLACE, BUT\nNEEDS TO APOLOGIZE. HE'S NOT ONLY INSULTING OUR\nFIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT, HE'S INSULTING OUR\nFATHERS AND MOTHER AND THOSE WHO WORKED HARD TO GET HERE.\nTHE PRESIDENT IS THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION.\nIF YOU GO AFTER HIM, YOU ARE GOING AFTER ALL OF US.\nIT'S DEEPLY EMOTIONAL. >> EVEN IF DONALD TRUMP IS TO\nVERBALLY APOLOGIZE, TAKE IT A STEP FURTHER THAN HIS ADMISSION\nTHAT HE RECOGNIZES THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS BORN IN THE UNITED\nSTATES AND IF HE WERE TO COME OUT AND FURTHER EXPLAIN WHY THE E PIFMY.\nHOW MIGHT IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR DONALD TRUMP IN THE EYES OF\nTHE VOTERS THAT ARE NOT WILLING TO ELECT HIM?\n>> YOU CAN CLOSE A CHAPTER AND YOU ARE HONORABLE TO ADMIT YOUR\nMISTAKES. FOR THOSE OF US IN THE\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, MOST OF US ARE NOT GOING TO BE SWAYED\nBY THAT. WE WANT THE CLOSURE.\nNOT DEHUMANIZING OUR PRESIDENT OR US.\nIT'S INTERESTING, THEY ARE STUDENTS OF HISTORY.\nTHERE WAS A MOVEMENT CALLED A NO NOTHING MOVEMENT OR THE NATIVE\nAMERICAN MOVEMENT. REPUBLICAN WHITE MALES WANTED TO\nPURIFY OUR COUNTRY. IT RAN FOR ABOUT A DECADE.\nWHAT DONALD TRUMP IS DOING IS REPEATING THAT PATTERN.\nHE WANTS TO PURIFY THE COUNTRY. IT WAS ABILITY IMMIGRANTS THEN.\nTHAT TIME IT WAS IRISH AND CATHOLICS.\nRIGHT NOW, HE'S SAYING, I DON'T WANT ANYBODY OTHER THAN PURE,\nWHITE MALES RUNNING THIS COUNTRY.\nI'M GOING TO BUILD A WALL FOR THE MEXICANS.\n>> HE DIDN'T SAY THAT. HE DIDN'T VERBALIZE IT THAT WAY.\n>> HIS SENTIMENTS ARE THAT. PEOPLE ARE REJECTING THE R\nRUDENESS AND THE DISRESPECT OF THE HIGHEST OFFICE.\nHE NEEDS TO APOLOGIZE AND PUT CLOSURE ON THAT TO MOVE ON.\n>> DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN IN TWO CHURCHES IN A PUBLIC PLACE,\nBLACK CHURCHES TRYING TO APPEAL TO BLACK VOTERS.\nHILLARY CLINTON MADE IT CLEAR, EVEN THOUGH HER COMMITMENT CAN\nSPAN MANY YEARS, A RECORD OF HAVING A COMMITMENT TO NON-WHITE\nCOMMUNITIES, ALL COMMUNITIES, SHE SAID SHE'S NOT TAKING THE\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE FOR GRANTED.\nWHAT DO PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR FROM EITHER ONE OF THESE CANDIDATES\nTO FEEL THAT THEIR VOTE WILL TRANSFORM INTO SOMETHING, SOME\nBENEFITS FOR THEM? >> TWO THINGS.\nONE IS, THAT IT IS REALLY LATE IN THE GAME FOR DONALD TRUMP TO\nBE THERE. IT'S ABOUT RELATIONSHIP THAT IS\nARE LIFELONG. HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN IN OUR\nCOMMUNITY FOR A LONG TIME. WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR IS THAT\nTHE LEAST OF THESE, THE SCRIPTURE, THE LEAST OF THESE IS\nGOING TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. IT'S NOT JUST THE 1% OR THE 47%.\nIT'S A WHOLE NATION THAT IS SUFFERING.\nIF WE TAKE A PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE THAT SAYS ONE NATION\nUNDER GOD INDY VISIBLE, WE WANT A LEADER THAT IS NOT GOING TO\nDIVIDE. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERY ONE\nOF THE CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES IS TAKEN CARE OF,\nREGARDLESS OF ETHNICITY, RACE OR CLASS.\nLOOKING AT THE WHOLE SOCIOECONOMIC PICTURE, WE WANT A\nPRESIDENT THAT IS GOING TO BE A PRESIDENT FOR ALL AMERICANS.\n>> YOU TALKED TO HILLARY CLINTON YESTERDAY?\n>> I DID NOT SPEAK TO HER. SHE WAS AT A BLACK WOMEN'S\nAGENDA. MANY ARE EXCITED TO SUPPORT HER.\nWE ARE CHEERING HER ON THAT SHE'S STRONG AGAIN AND WE WANT\nTO PRAYERFULLY, CAREFULLY UPHOLD HER.\nSHE IS READY. I HAVE KNOWN HER FOR 25 YEARS.\nSHE WAS IN MY CHURCH WHEN I WAS A PASTOR BEFORE SHE BECAME U.S.\nSENATOR OF NEW YORK. SHE'S VISITING US SEVER YEARS.\nSHE'S BEEN THERE AS A WORSHIPPER, PARISHIONER FOR US.\nWE HAVE A TRACK RECORD AND HISTORY.\nTHAT'S GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT.\nWHO HAS BEEN WITH US IN THE PAST?\nWHO WILL STAND WITH US NOW? IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT TIME IN\nHISTORY. >> SUSAN JOHNSON-COOK.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH. ENJOY THE DINNER THIS EVENING.\n>> THANK YOU. >> WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEWS\nTHAT'S GOING TO RESULT FROM THIS EVENING AND TODAY, QUITE\nFRANKLY. >> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.\nWE LOOK FORWARD TO WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN FOR AMERICA.\nWE ARE GOING VOTE AND MOST OF US FOR HILLARY.\n>> THANK YOU, APPRECIATE IT. >> THANK YOU.\n>> YOU CAN SEE THE FULL COVERAGE OF PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HILLARY\nCLINTON'S REMARKS STARTING AT",

FROM HIS TIME RUNNING THE TRUMP\nCORPORATION IN THE 1970s, DISCRIMINATING AGAINST\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS AND LATINOS IN HOUSING, LABELING THEIR\nAPPLICATION WITH A C SO THEY WOULD BE SET ASIDE, AND\nEXCLUDED. FROM HIS NORTHWESTER THE 1980s\nWHERE HE LED THE LYNCH MOB AGAINST THE CENTRAL PARK FIVE,\nFOUR AFRICAN-AMERICAN MEN AND ONE LATINO WHO WERE WRONGFULLY\nCONVICTED BUT DONALD TRUMP WANTED TO SEND THEM TO THE DEATH\nPENALTY. AND THEN, OF COURSE, HIS EFFORT\nTO LEAD THE BIRTHER MOVEMENT. WHICH IS NOTHING MORE THAN A\nFRAUD DESIGNED TO APPEAL TO THE RACIST AND THE BIG GOTS AND SEEP\nKNOW PHONES WHO WANTED TO DELENGTH JUSTICE HIGHS THE FIRST\nBLACK PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\nIF YOU QUESTION DONALD TRUMP'S TRUE MOTIVE, EXHIBIT A IS HIS\nLEADERSHIP IN THE BIRTHER MOVEMENT.\nHE IS NOT QUALIFIED TO BE COMMANDER IN CHIEF.\nHE IS A HATER IN CHIEF. >> IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS HAVE HEAD A UNIQUE AND SPECIAL JOURNEY IN\nTHE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

AND TO END THE CASE AS A\nCANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES.\nI RESPECT ALL FORMER PRESIDENTS AND EXISTING PRESIDENTS AS MY\nDUTY AND I WILL INDICATE WHAT THE TRUTH IS.\nBUT MR.

RIGHT?\nTHE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS FOR DONALD TRUMP TO GET THE\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE, WHAT HE SHOULD HAVE DONE IS GO OUT AND\nAPOLOGIZE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FOR PERPETUATING THIS FRAUD AND\nHE DID NOT. HE PIMPED THE MEDIA BEYOND\nBELIEF, RIGHT? AND HE'S NOT GOING TO GET BLACK\nVOTERS.

TUCKER WAS SHOWING US EARLIER\nTHIS MORNING THE REAL CLEAR AVERAGE, THE TREND LINES.\nYOU LOOK AT THE MOMENTUM AND HOW JUST GIVEN THE LAST TWO WEEKS\nREALLY HAS TRUMP MOVING UPWARD AND HILLARY CLINTON MOVING THE\nOPPOSITE DIRECTION. AND YOU LOOK AT THE TWO\nCANDIDATES. HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN RUNNING\nFOR PRESIDENT FOR YEARS AND YEARS.\nSHE'S GOT THE FOUNDATION, THE GROUND GAME.\nSHE'S GOT THE MONEY. LOOK AT DONALD TRUMP, HE DOESN'T\nHAVE ANY OF THAT. WHY IS THE MEDIA NOT FOCUSED ON\nTHE POLLS RIGHT NOW AND JUST THE REALITY THAT IT IS NECK AND\nNECK, ESPECIALLY IN THESE SWING STATES?\nTHAT'S A BIG STORY. >> BUT I HEARD TUCKER SAY\nACCURATELY HE'S STRAIGHT UP AND SHE'S STRAIGHT DOWN.\nTHAT'S WHAT TRUMP SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT.\nI'M GOING STRAIGHT UP, SHE'S GOING STRAIGHT DOWN.\nBUT WHEN YOU DISTRACT PEOPLE WITH THE STUFF -- WHEN YOU ALLOW\n\"NEW YORK TIMES\" TO GET CHEAP SHOT HEADLINES, TRUMP WHO\nPROMULGATED THE BIRTHER STUFF NOW CLAIMS IT WAS HILLARY,\nFALSELY, POLITIFACT FALSE 16 PINOCCHIOS.\n>> EASY HEADLINES FOR THEM. >> EASY.\nYOU'RE GIVING CHEAP SHOT TO YOUR ENEMY.\n>> GERALDO, WE'D LOVE TO GET YOU BACK OUTSIDE IN LEDERHOSEN\nBECAUSE WE'VE TRIED THE FOOD.

LET'S BRING IN STEPHEN COLLINSON\nTO TALK ABOUT THIS. CNN REPORTER.\nSTEPHEN, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE COMMENTS FIRST OF ALL?\n>> WELL I THINK IT'S JUST THE LATEST EXAMPLE OF ALMOST CY-OPS\nOPERATIONS THEY'RE CONDUCTING. WHAT'S HAPPENED THE RUSSIAN\nINTELLIGENCE IS ACCUSED OF OF TRYING TO INTERFERE IN THE U.S.\nPOLITICAL PROCESS. YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT PUTIN\nPUTIN'S ENTIRE POLITICAL PROPERTY IS TO RESTORE THE\nRESPECT THAT HE BELIEVES RUSSIA LOST AT THE END OF THE COLD WAR,\nIN A HUMILIATING PERIOD. AND THAT TO ONE WAY TO DO THAT\nIS UNDERMINE U.S. AUTHORITY AROUND THE WORLD.\nSO THESE HACKINGS OF DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE AND OTHER\nISSUES ARE ONE WAY THAT PUTIN CAN POINT TO THE U.S. POLITICAL\nSYSTEM. AND SAY, LOOK, UNITED STATES\nISN'T THIS GREAT PARADIGM OF DEMOCRACY.\nIT'S SHOULDN'T BE TELLING PEOPLE TO DO.\nHE'S SAYING THAT TO GLOBAL AUDIENCES AND RUSSIAN AUDIENCES.\nSAYING LOOK, WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING.\nBUT THE U.S. IS ACCUSING US. WE'VE DONE NOTHING WRONG.\nIT'S GONE BACK TO THE EVIL EMPIRE RHETORIC OF THE REAGAN\nYEARS THAT THE U.S. IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SORT OF RIPPING\nUP THE ATMOSPHERE OF ALMOST A NEW COLD WAR.\nSO THIS IS A MESSAGE THAT, YOU KNOW, VLADIMIR PUTIN'S POLITICAL\nPOWER BASE IN RUSSIA IS BASED LARGELY ON NATIONALISM.\nTHE ECONOMY IS NOT DOING VERY WELL.\nIT'S INCREASINGLY AN >> AND DO YOU SEE IT WORKING?\n>> WELL, YOU HAVE TO SAY THAT IN ONE SENSE VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS\nSUCCEEDED IN INCREASING RUSSIAN INFLUENCE.\nLOOK, HE IS IN THE MIDDLE OF A CONFLICT IN SYRIA.\nJOHN KERRY HAS BEEN GOING THROUGH THIS EXHAUSTIVE\nNEGOTIATION WITH THE RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER OVER THAT.\nBACK AT THE G20 SUMMIT A FEW WEEKS AGO, HE WAS IN THE THICK\nOF IT IN CHINA. THIS IS A LEADER THAT TWO YEARS\nAGO LEFT THE G20 SUMMIT EARLY BECAUSE HE WAS AWE INDUSTRY\nSIZED BECAUSE OF HIS ACTIONS IN UKRAINE AND CRIMEA.\nCERTAINLY VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS INCREASED RUSSIA'S PUNCHING\nWEIGHT F YOU LIKE, ON THE GLOBAL STAGE.\nWHETHER IN THE LONG RUN THAT'S IN RUSSIA'S INTEREST IS ANOTHER\nTHING. LIKE I SAID, THE ECONOMY IS\nCRASHING. IT'S OVERRELIANT ON ENERGY\nSOURCES. AND HE HAS TAKEN THE COUNTRY\nDOWN AN AUTHORITARIAN PATH. IN THIS SENSE, I THINK IT'S\nPOSSIBLE TO ARGUE THAT THERE'S ONE THING THAT'S IN THE\nGOVERNMENT IN MOSCOW'S INTERESTS AND VLADIMIR PUTIN'S INTERESTS.\nONE THING THAT'S IN THE LONG-TERM INTEREST OF THE\nRUSSIAN PEOPLE. >> WE APPRECIATE IT SO MUCH,\nSTEVEN COLINSON.

THE AIDE IS BLOCKED.\nTHERE'S A CRITICAL MOMENT COMING UP.\nTHERE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SEVEN DAYS OF A CEASE-FIRE, THEN IT\nSTARTED LAST MONDAY SO THIS MONDAY WOULD BE SEVEN DAYS.\nTHE U.S. AND RUSSIA WERE SUPPOSED TO COOPERATE WITH JOINT\nTARGETING INFORMATION. PUTIN BLAMES THE U.S. IN THAT\nSOUNDBYTE. PRESIDENT OBAMA BLAMING RUSSIA\nAFTER MEETING WITH THE SECURITY COUNCIL.\nI DON'T SEE MUCH MAJOR PROGRESS HERE.\nIT DECREASED THE VIOLENCE. THIS SORT OF DANCE BETWEEN THE\nU.S. AND RUSSIA CONTINUES WHERE THEY ARE BLAMING EACH OTHER.\n>> FRED, RUSSIA CONTINUING TO PUSH TOWARD WIDENING THE LANE TO\nALLOW HUMANITARIAN AID THROUGH. IS IT PUTTING PRESSURE ON THE\nASSAD REGIME TO MAKE IT HAPPEN? HOW IT IS ASSISTING, IF AT ALL?\n>> SO FAR, IT ISN'T PUTTING MUCH PRESSURE ON THE ASSAD REGIME.\nWHAT WE HAVE BEEN HEARING FROM THE KREMLIN IS THEY SAY THE\nMILITARY IS IMBODIED BY THE CEASE-FIRE.\nWHAT WE HAVE HEARD OVER THE PAST COUPLE DAYS, THE SOUTHWESTERN\nREGIONS OF ALEPPO IS THERE IS STILL A SHELLING GOING ON AND\nSEEMS TO BE GOING ON FROM BOTH SIDES.\nYES, IT'S LESS THAN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IF THE CEASE-FIRE WERE\nNOT IN PLACE. IT'S NOT LIKE BOTH SIDES AREN'T\nSTILL SHOOTING AT EACH OTHER. IT IS A MAJOR INHIBITOR OF THE\nAID GETTING THROUGH AS WELL. ONE THING I WANT TO POINT OUT IS\nTHAT THE LONGER IT TAKES TO GET HERE, THE MORE THE CEASE-FIRE\nCOMES AND THE MORE NERVOUS THEY GET.\nBOTH SIDES HAVE TO KEEP THE CEASE-FIRE UPRIGHT.\nRIGHT NOW, IT'S NOT GOING ON. YOU DO SEE THE INFRINGEMENTS OF\nCEASE-FIRE -- STARTING TO INCREASE FOR THAT AID TO GET\nTHROUGH. >> ALREADY, FRED.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH.

SO, TRUMP RIGHT NOW ENJOYS A\nFIVE-POINT LEAD IN THE STATE OF OHIO, VERY IMPORTANT STATE THAT\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN DEFINITELY WANTS TO WIN.\nSANDERS PRIME TARGET IS MILLENIAL VOTERS.\nHE OVERWHELMINGLY OUTPERFORMED CLINTON WITH THIS GROUP.\nTHIS IS WHY WE ARE GOING TO HEAR HIM TALK ABOUT ISSUES THAT\nMATTER TO THE YOUNGER VOTERS, LIKE COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY AND\nCOLLEGE DEBT. BUT, KEEP IN MIND, POLICY IS NOT\nTHE ONLY ISSUE WE CAN EXPECT TO HEAR FROM BERNIE SANDERS.\nHE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THE BROADER ISSUE OF HILLARY\nCLINTON'S OPPONENT, DONALD TRUMP.\nWE SAW HIM TALK JUST NOW AT KENT STATE UNIVERSITY AND WE HEARD\nHARSH RHETORIC FROM BERNIE SANDERS ABOUT TRUMP SAYING THAT\nTRUMP'S CAMPAIGN IS BASED ON BIGOTRY AND REMINDING VOTERS\nTRUMP WAS BEHIND SOME OF THE BIRTHER MOVEMENT STATEMENT THAT\nIS ARE OUT THERE. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY AN ISSUE THAT\nTRUMP HAD TO DEAL WITH OVER THE LAST COUPLE DAYS.\nA LOT OF CLINTON SURROGATES OUT THERE CAMPAIGNING FOR HER IN THE\nNEXT COUPLE WEEKS AS THINGS REALLY GET DOWN TO THE WIRE.\n>> DOWN TO THE WIRE INDEED. THANK YOU SO MUCH, M.J. LEE,\nAPPRECIATE THAT.",

HERE IS MRS. OBAMA TODAY\nFROM GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY RIGHT OUTSIDE OF WASHINGTON\nFAIRFAX, VIRGINIA. >> WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO\nELECT ONE OF THE MOST QUALIFIED PEOPLE WHO HAS\nEVER ENDEAVORED TO BECOME PRESIDENT.\nHILLARY HAS BEEN A LAWYER, A LAW PROFESSOR, FIRST LADY OF\nARKANSAS, FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES A U.S.\nSENATOR, SECRETARY OF STATE. DO YOU HEAR ME?\n>> AN OUTGOING PRESIDENT'S APPROVAL RATING CAN BE AN\nINDICATOR OF HOW THAT PARTY'S NOMINEE WILL DO IN\nTHE PRESIDENT ELECTION. HAS BEEN MANY TIMES.\nRIGHT NOW THE REAL CLEAR MICKS AVERAGE HAS PRESIDENT\nOBAMA'S APPROVAL RATING AS 50 POINT 6.\nWHICH AFTER 8 YEARS IS NOT BAD AT ALL.\nNIGHTLY POLITICAL PANEL IS HERE FROM THE \"WASHINGTON\nTIMES\" STEPHEN DINAN AND FROM \"U.S.A. TODAY\" HEIDI.\nSO WHAT ABOUT THE OBAMAS GETTING OUT ON THE TRAIL?\nIS IT POSSIBLE THAT A PRESIDENT AND PRESIDENT AND\nFIRST LADY CAN HAVE SOME KIND OF COAT TAIL EFFECTS IN\nAN ELECTION WHICH HE IS NOT ON THE BALLOT.\n>> IT COULD CERTAINLY BE HELPFUL, NO SURROGATE IS A\nREPLACEMENT FOR A REALLY STRONG CANDIDATE.\nBUT THIS PRESIDENT GIVEN THE APPROVAL RATINGS YOU JUST\nCITED AS WELL AS THE FACT THAT HER STRATEGIC CHALLENGE\nRIGHT NOW IS REASSEMBLING HIS PREVIOUS COALITION IN\nTERMS OF HIGH TURNOUT AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICANS.\nHIGH TURNOUT AMONG YOUNG VOTERS.\nI WOULD EXPECT THEY WOULD DEPLOY BOTH THE PRESIDENT\nAND HIS WIFE BOTH INTO BLACK CHURCHES AND UNIVERSITY\nCAMPUSES. HE IS ALSO A MORE GIFTED\nCOMMUNICATOR. SOME THINK, THAN HILLARY\nCLINTON. >> SOME PEOPLE THINK SHE IS\nA MORE GIFT THE COMMUNICATOR THAN HILLARY CLINTON.\n>> I DON'T THINK THOUGH ANY ONE SURROGATE OR ANY NEW\nDEVELOPMENT IN THE CAMPAIGN IS GOING TO HAVE A DRAMATIC\nEFFECT. I DO THINK THESE UPCOMING\nDEBATES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO REALLY GIVEN THE NUMBERS\nWE ARE SEEING RIGHT NOW THAT A FOURTH ACCORDING TO A POLL\nCOULD HELP DETERMINE THEIR VOTES.\nTHAT'S A HIGH NUMBER. >> I THINK PEOPLE LIKE TO\nTELL POLLSTERS THAT THEY WANT TO TELL THE POLLSTERS I\nWILL TAKE THE DEBATE SERIOUSLY AND SOUNDS LIKE A\nRESPONSIBLE THING TO SAY. STEPHEN?\n>> LOOK, IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT MRS. OBAMA WAS AT A\nUNIVERSITY CAMPUS TODAY AS HEIDI MENTIONED.\nTHE KEY HERE IS THE ENTHUSIASM GAP AS YOUR\nGENTLEMAN FROM REAL CLEAR POLITICS MENTIONED EARLIER.\nMILLENNIALS ARE NOT AS EXCITED ABOUT HILLARY\nCLINTON AS THEY WERE ABOUT OBAMA.\nTHE PRESIDENT AND THE FIRST LADY CAN HAVE A LOT TO DO\nWITH THAT, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE GALLUP POLL ACTUALLY HAS\nOBAMA I BELIEVE AT PLUS 11 IN THE APPROVAL RATING RIGHT\nNOW. THAT'S THE REALLY POPULAR,\nOBVIOUSLY. IT'S ALMOST UNHEARD OF FOR A\nPRESIDENT AT THIS POINT IN THE TERM, CERTAINLY COMPARED\nWITH WHERE PRESIDENT BUSH WAS.\nTHE PRESIDENT TODAY IS TALKING ABOUT THE\nTRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP AND HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS TO GET\nTHAT DONE. AN ISSUE CLINTON DOESN'T\nWANT HIM OUT THERE TALKING ABOUT.\nTHERE IS DISTANCE THEY HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT.\nHE IS A HELP TO HER ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\n>> ONE THING YOU USUALLY SEE IN THESE CYCLES WHEN IT GETS\nDOWN TO IT IN THE END NO MATTER WHAT THE PRESIDENT\nWANTS APPROVAL RATING IS HE IS ALWAYS A FUNDRAISING\nCHAMPION IN HIS OWN PARTY. I DON'T SEE I DON'T SENSE\nTHAT'S HOW THIS PRESIDENT IS GOING TO BE DEPLOYED AND I'M\nNOT SURE MONEY BEING SPENT BY THE BUCKET LOAD BY THE\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN AND NOT NEARLY AS MUCH BY THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN IS MAKING THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE.\nHEIDI? >> SO FAR AHEAD OF HIM IN\nTERMS OF FUNDRAISING AND ORGANIZATIONAL ASPECT OF\nTHIS RACE STEVEN AND I OUTLINING AS GOING INTO\nSTRATEGIC POCKETS TO HELP TRY AND PUT BACK THAT\nCOALITION. BECAUSE, IF TURNOUT IS NOT\nAS HIGH IN TRUMP ON THE, YOU KNOW, TRADITIONAL DEMOCRATIC\nCOALITION SIDE, AND IT IS ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE.\nTHAT'S GOING TO BE A HUGE PROBLEM.\n>> QUICKLY, STEPHEN. >> YOU KNOW, THAT'S EXACTLY\nRIGHT. THE OTHER THING TO REMEMBER\nIS THEY ARE FIGHTING FOR THEIR OWN LEGACY,\nMRS. CLINTON MENTIONED HER HUSBAND'S NAME 17 TIMES\nTODAY AND HILLARY CLINTON ONLY 12 TIMES.\nTHIS IS THEIR LEGACY ON THE LINE.\nTHEY ARE GOING TO DO WHAT THEY CAN.\n>> STEPHEN AND HEIDI THANK YOU.\nDONALD TRUMP ON \"THE TONIGHT SHOW\" WITH JIMMY FALLON.\nWHO CAN FORGET FALLON MESSING UP DONALD TRUMP'S\nHAIR. TODAY CLINTON SAT DOWN WITH\nFALLON. WE RECEIVED A PREVIEW CLIP.\nTAKE A LOOK. >> WELCOME, WELCOME,\nWELCOME, WELCOME.

BUT MY POINT IS, I DON'T KNOW\nANY SPECIAL U.S. OPERATOR WHO IS ADVISING.\nTHAT MEANS WE'RE TRAINING, YOU'RE LIVING, FIGHTING, EATING,\nTHESE GUYS BECOME YOUR FRIENDS. I DON'T KNOW ANY SPECIAL\nOPERATOR WHO'S NOT GOING TO ACTUALLY LEAVE A BASE AND GET\nINTO THE GUN FIGHT WHEN HE SEES THAT HIS GUYS ARE GETTING PINNED\nDOWN. SO RIGHT NOW IT IS A QUAGMIRE.\nOUR FRIENDS ARE UNKNOWN. OUR ALLIES ARE UNKNOWN.\nENEMIES ALL AROUND. AND YOU'VE GOT THE GIANTS LIKE\nTURKEY AND RUSSIA. >> THERE'S TWO WORDS THERE YOU\nUSED THAT I CAN'T LET GO BY. ONE IS ADVISE, WHICH IS WHAT THE\nINITIAL U.S. TROOPS IN VIETNAM WERE DOING.\nTHE SECOND WORD IS QUAGMIRE, WHICH IS WHAT VIETNAM BECAME.\nIS THAT WHERE WE'RE HEADED? >> WELL, LOOK, I THINK SO.\nBUT LOOK, AT LEAST IN VIETNAM, YOU HAD THE VIET CONG, YOU HAD\nTHE NORTH VIETNAMESE. EVEN THAT WAS COMPLEX.\nBUT HERE YOU'VE GOT, YOU KNOW, REBELS THAT THEIR MAIN FOCUS IS\nALL THEY'VE WANTED TO DO IS REMOVE ASSAD.\nWE'VE GOT REBELS THAT WE SOMEHOW WERE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHO THE\nMODERATE ONES WERE, AND FUNDED AND TRAINED THEM AND GAVE THEM\nWEAPONS. >> I'VE ONLY GOT 45 SECONDS.\nI WANT TO GET IN ONE LAST QUESTION ABOUT THE NAME YOU SAID\nWHICH IS ASSAD. BY OUR COUNT IT WAS 1,661 DAYS\nAGO SINCE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SAID ASSAD MUST\nGO, AND, QUOTE, ASSAD'S DAYS ARE NUMBERED.\nHAVE WE LOST SIGHT OF THAT NOW, NOW THAT WE HAVE THIS MORASS\nTHAT YOU DESCRIBED ON THE WHITE BOARD THAT YOUR 7-YEAR-OLD\nDAUGHTER, AND PERHAPS THE REST OF THE COUNTRY IS PRETTY\nCONFUSED BY? >> ABSOLUTELY WE'VE LOST SIGHT\nOF IT. I MEAN, AT EVERY STAGE WE'VE\nJUST GIVEN IN. LET'S NOT FORGET, THIS IS THE\nSAME PRESIDENT THAT DREW A RED LINE WITH A CRAYON IN THE SAND\nWHEN HE SAID IF ASSAD EVER USED CHEMICAL WEAPONS, WHICH HE HAS.\nBUT THE FACT IS WE LEFT THAT POWER VACUUM OF VACUUM OF\nCHOICE. AT THIS POINT WE'RE DOING\nEVERYTHING WE CAN JUST TO APPEASE THE RUSSIANS AND I'LL\nTELL YOU, IT'S GOING TO HAVE SOME SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES\nBECAUSE SYRIA AS A COUNTRY IS NOT GOING TO RECOVER FOR AT\nLEAST ANOTHER 40 YEARS IF EVER. >> IF EVER AND WHEN YOU SEE THE\nPICTURES THERE IT'S HEART BREAKING AND TO THINK OF THE\nMILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TRULY CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS\nTHAT ARE INNOCENT CIVILIANS THAT YOU WORKED TO HARD TO SAVE.\nAPPRECIATE YOUR TIME AS ALWAYS. >> THANKS.\n>> GOOD TO SEE YOU. >> ANY MINUTE NOW DONALD TRUMP\nTAKES THE STAGE IN HOUSTON. HE'S SPEAKING AT THE FIRST\nANNUAL CONFERENCE FOR FAMILIES OF LOVED ONES KILLED BY ILLEGAL\nIMMIGRANTS. WE'LL HAVE A REPORT AT THE TOP\nOF THE HOUR. >> AND REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF\nONE OF AMERICA'S FINEST PLAY WRIGHTS.",

OUR METEOROLOGIST, DEREK VAN\nDAM, IS HERE. >> FIRST WE WERE TALKING ABOUT\nTYPHOON HER ANNIE IN THE -- MERANTI IN THE SOUTHERN\nSECTIONS. NOW A 72-HOUR TIME GAP WHERE THE\nISLAND NATION HAS BEEN BATTERED BY ANOTHER TYPHOON.\nUNBELIEVABLE. VERY ACTIVE.\nLET'S GET TO THE DETAILS. FIRST, YOU HAVE TO SEE WHAT\nMERANTI DID TO THE SOUTHERN TIP OF TAIWAN EARLIER THIS WEEK.\nI WANT TO JUST GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE TYPHOON -- THIS NATION\nTHAT GETS STRUCK BY SO MANY TYPHOONS.\nI WANT YOU TO SEE THIS ASTOUNDING FOOTAGE OF A WOMAN ON\nHER MICROTRYING TO JUST WITHSTAND TYPHOON-FORCE WINDS.\nDEFINITELY NOT RECOMMENDED. I WANT TO BREAK DOWN THE TWO\nSTORMS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO SEE THE DIFFERENCE.\nMERANTI, HERE'S THE PATH AS IT DEVELOPED WEST OF GUAM.\nTHAT IMPACTING THE SOUTHERN SECTIONS OF TAIWAN BEFORE MAKING\nLANDFALL ACROSS SOUTHEAST CHINA. NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TYPHOON\nMALAKAS. THAT SIM PACTING THE EXTREME\nNORTHERN SECTIONS OF TAIWAN AND THE SOUTHERN JAPANESE ISLANDS.\nBREAKING IT DOWN EVEN FURTHER, MERANTI, 72 HOURS AGO, HAD WIND\nGUSTS OF OVER 180 KILOMETER WHEN IT IMPACTED THE REGION.\nTAIPEI, GUSTY WINDS OF 90 MILES PER HOUR.\nCURRENT TIME, WE TALK ABOUT MALAKAS, OUR CURRENTS STORM.\nYOU SEE THE WIND GUSTS ACROSS THE AREA, SPECIFICALLY ACROSS\nTHE OKINAWA PREFECTURE. REMEMBER WE HAVE THEATIVE\nLOCATED WITHIN THIS REGION, AS WELL.\nTHE LATEST FROM THE JOINT TYPHOON WARNING SIGN, 205\nKILOMETER PER-HOUR SUSTAINED WINDS.\nTHE MAJORITY OF THE CON VIRGINIA TECH OR THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY IS\nNORTH AND EAST OF TAIWAN. THAT'S WHERE WE FIND THE BULK OF\nTHE EXTREMELY STRONG WINDS, AS WELL.\nTHIS STORM WILL PICK UP SPEED GOING FORWARD, AND IT'S GOING TO\nDETERIORATE AS IT DOES. IT'S STILL A FORMIDABLE STORM.\nGUSTY CONDITIONS AS WE SPEAK. THE WINDS DIED DOWN QUICKLY IN\nTAIPEI. FOR THE ISLAND ACROSS SOUTHERN\nJAPAN, THAT AREA STILL FEELING THE EFFECTS OF THE OUTER RAIN\nBAND OF THE STORM SYSTEM. BELIEVE IT OR NOT, EVEN THOUGH\nWE'VE HAD THE RECENT UPTICK IN TYPHOON ACTIVITY ACROSS TAIWAN\nAND SOUTHEAST ASIA, WE'RE BELOW AVERAGE FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR.\nNORMALLY WE WOULD SEE 11 TYPHOONS, BUT WE'VE ONLY HAD SIX\nSO FAR. HARD TO BELIEVE CONSIDERING THAT\nTAIWAN'S HAD TWO IMPACTING THEM WITHIN THE COURSE OF A WEEK.\n>> WOW.",
