              "text": "WITH MORE.\nGOOD MORNING. >> Reporter: GOOD MORNING,\nCAROL. HOUSE REPUBLICAN LEADERS ARE\nEXPECTED TO TELL THEIR MEMBERS TODAY THAT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO\nSUPPORT DONALD TRUMP, DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO.\nYOU CAN RUN AWAY FROM HIM IF YOU NEED TO BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, THIS\nPARTY IS IN SELF-PRESERVATION MODE, PARTICULARLY AFTER THIS\nWEEKEND'S DEVELOPMENTS IN THAT VIDEO OF DONALD TRUMP AND THAT\n\"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD\" INTERVIEW WITH BILLY BUSH BRAGGING ABOUT\nGROPING WOMEN. THE REPUBLICANS OBVIOUSLY WE SAW\nOVER THE WEEKEND RUNNING AWAY FROM HIM.\nBUT THAT DEBATE PERFORMANCE MAY HAVE STOPPED SOME OF THE\nBLEEDING, AT LEAST WHAT I'M HEARING THIS MORNING IN TALKING\nTO REPUBLICAN OFFICIALS. THEY ARE NOT EXPECTING A MASS\nEXODUS TODAY. THEY BELIEVE THAT DONALD TRUMP\nAT LEAST CLEARED A HURDLE TO KEEP SOME OF THE PARTY BEHIND\nHIM. ONE PERSON, VERY IMPORTANT\nPERSON IS HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN.\nWE KNOW HE HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TIME GETTING BEHIND HIM\nINITIALLY. LATER ENDORSED DONALD TRUMP.\nRIGHT NOW, A SOURCE WITH PAUL RYAN'S OFFICE TELLS ME THAT\nTHERE'S NO CHANGE IN PAUL RYAN'S POSITION, MEANING HE'S STILL\nSUPPORTING DONALD TRUMP FOR NOW. ONE REASON WHY IS BECAUSE --\nPOTENTIALLY WHY IS BECAUSE MIKE PENCE, DONALD TRUMP'S RUNNING\nMATE, IS ALSO VERY CLOSE TO HOUSE REPUBLICANS AND PAUL RYAN,\nALSO MAKING A SHOW OF UNITY THIS MORNING SPEAKING TO OUR\nCOLLEAGUE. >> IT'S ABSOLUTELY FALSE TO\nSUGGEST THAT AT ANY POINT IN TIME, WE CONSIDERED DROPPING OFF\nTHIS TICKET. IT'S THE GREATEST HONOR OF MY\nLIFE TO HAVE BEEN NOMINATED BY MY PARTY TO BE THE NEXT VICE\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\nLOOK, POLITICS IS A VERY TOUGH BUSINESS.\nI GET THAT. THIS IS MY FIRST TIME AT THE\nNATIONAL LEVEL AND THE FACT IS THAT, YOU KNOW, AS I SAID ON\nSATURDAY, I COULDN'T CONDONE, I COULDN'T DEFEND THOSE REMARKS.\nI ENCOURAGED DONALD TRUMP ON FRIDAY TO APOLOGIZE FOR THEM.\nHE DID. >> Reporter: NOW, CLEARLY MIKE\nPENCE TRYING TO MAKE A SHOW OF UNITY AND BRING THIS PARTY BACK\nTOGETHER AGAIN. IT WILL TAKE A LONG WAYS TO GO\nTO ACTUALLY GET EVERYBODY ON BOARD BEHIND TRUMP.\nTHEY WANT TO PREVENT MASS DEFECTIONS.\nWE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THAT CONFERENCE CALL.\nRIGHT NOW WE ARE NOT GETTING MUCH INDICATION THAT THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY LEADERSHIP IS PLANNING TO BOLT.\nTHEY MAY STAND BY HIM RIGHT NOW. DONALD TRUMP STILL ON THIN ICE\nWITH MUCH OF HIS PARTY. >> SO MANU, YOU STAY RIGHT\nTHERE. AS WE HAVE SAID, IN JUST AN HOUR\nTHE HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN, THE MOST POWERFUL REPUBLICAN IN THE\nCOUNTRY, WILL HOLD THAT CONFERENCE CALL.\nTHEY WILL TALK TRUMP. WOULDN'T YOU LOVE TO BE A FLY ON\nTHE WALL. I KNOW FIVE PEOPLE WHO\nDEFINITELY WOULD. MANU RAJU IS ONE.\nALSO JOINING ME, PATRICIA MURPHY, FROM THE DAILY BEAST.\nLARRY SABADO FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CENTER FOR POLITICS,\nCNN SENIOR POLITICAL REPORTER NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON IS HERE AND\nMARK PRESTON. WELCOME TO ALL OF YOU.\nSO MANU, I WILL START WITH YOU BECAUSE YOU HAVE A LOT OF GREAT\nSOURCES ON CAPITOL HILL. YOU ARE OUR CONGRESSIONAL\nCORRESPONDENT. WHAT DID MR. TRUMP SAY LAST\nNIGHT TO MAKE PAUL RYAN FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE?\n>> WELL, ONE THING REPUBLICANS WANTED TO HEAR WAS A LOT OF\nCONTRITION. THEY WANTED TO HEAR HIM COME OUT\nAND SAY HE WAS APOLOGETIC ABOUT WHAT HE SAID.\nWE DIDN'T GET A LOT OF THAT FROM DONALD TRUMP LAST NIGHT.\nIN FACT, HE SORT OF DISMISSED THE CONTROVERSY.\nHE DID APOLOGIZE BUT THEN HE SAID, YOU KNOW, THIS IS A\nDISTRACTION AND THIS IS LOCKER ROOM TALK, REALLY DISMISSING IT.\nI THINK WHAT REPUBLICANS AT LARGE FEEL IS THAT HE'S ABLE TO\nSHIFT THE NARRATIVE, TURN THE NARRATIVE BACK TO HILLARY\nCLINTON AND MAKE IT NOT ABOUT THE VIDEOTAPE ANYMORE.\nIT ALMOST RALLIED THE BASE BEHIND HIM.\nIN SOME WAYS IT'S NOT NECESSARY THAT PAUL RYAN IS MORE\nCOMFORTABLE. IN A LOT OF WAYS HE'S SORT OF\nBOXED IN BECAUSE PAUL RYAN RIGHT NOW WERE TO RESCIND HIS\nENDORSEMENT, IT WOULD CREATE SUCH AN UPROAR WITHIN HIS PARTY,\nESPECIALLY AFTER TRUMP REALLY RALLYING THE BASE LAST NIGHT\nWITH SUCH A BOMBASTIC PERFORMANCE AGAINST HILLARY\nCLINTON, THAT IT WOULD BE A REALLY BIG PROBLEM FOR THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY LEADERSHIP TO BOLT RIGHT NOW.\nTHEY HAD THEIR CHANCE ON SATURDAY.\nRIGHT NOW, THE NARRATIVE HAS SHIFTED.\nTHERE'S A FEELING THAT TRUMP IS DOING A LITTLE BIT BETTER AND\nTHAT MAKES IT A LOT HARDER FOR PARTY LEADERSHIP TO REBEL RIGHT\nNOW. >> SO NIA-MALIKA, THE\nREPUBLICANS THAT JUMPED OFF THE TRUMP TRAIN SINCE THEY HEARD\nTHOSE COMMENTS OF WHAT TRUMP SAID ON THAT BUS, THEY WERE ALSO\nUPSET, MANY OF THEM, THAT MR. TRUMP WAS GOING TO BRING IN\nTHESE WOMEN WHO ACCUSED BILL CLINTON OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT IN\nTHE PAST. THEY WERE VERY MUCH AGAINST\nTHAT. THEY VERY WANT THE DEBATE TO\nRETURN TO THE ISSUES WHICH IT KIND OF DIDN'T LAST NIGHT.\nSO AGAIN, WHAT DID MR. TRUMP DO TO STOP THE BLEEDING, SO TO\nSPEAK, AMONG THOSE, YOU KNOW, THOSE REPUBLICANS' MINDS WHO\nHAVE JUMPED OFF THE TRUMP TRAIN? >> YEAH.\nI WAS IN CONTACT DURING THE DEBATE WITH SOME REPUBLICANS AND\nTHEIR FEELING WAS BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON DIDN'T KNOCK\nDONALD TRUMP OUT OF THE DEBATE LAST NIGHT, IT WASN'T AN A-PLUS\nPERFORMANCE FROM HER, SHE DIDN'T EFFECTIVELY END HIS CANDIDACY\nLAST NIGHT, THEY FELT HE WAS ABLE TO HOLD HIS OWN, TO\nPROSECUTE A CASE AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON, SO THEREFORE, THEY FEEL\nLIKE THERE'S REASON TO HANG AROUND AND THAT THERE WOULDN'T\nBE A MASS EXODUS AS MANU TALKED ABOUT.\nALSO, I DO THINK YOU'RE RIGHT, THE KIND OF TABLOID NATURE OF\nHIS PRESS CONFERENCE BEFORE THE DEBATE AND SOME OF THE THINGS HE\nSAID IN THE DEBATE ALSO UNEXPECTED, CERTAINLY THE PRESS\nCONFERENCE AMONG MANY REPUBLICANS NOT NECESSARILY\nUNEXPECTED THAT HE MENTIONED IT BUT UNEXPECTED THAT THOSE FOLKS\nWERE THERE IN THE AUDIENCE, I THINK CERTAINLY WAS DISTASTEFUL\nTO A LOT OF REPUBLICANS. BUT LISTEN, AT THIS POINT, THEY\nARE TURNING THEIR ATTENTION TO SAVING THE SENATE, TRYING TO\nOBVIOUSLY KEEP THE HOUSE AND THAT'S -- THEY WERE HAVING\nMEETINGS EVEN AS THAT PRESS CONFERENCE WAS HAPPENING.\nSOME OF THE REPUBLICANS I WAS TALKING TO, STRATEGIZING ABOUT\nHOW TO SAVE THE SENATE. THEY FEEL LIKE HE HAS TURNED THE\nPAGE FROM THE VIDEO SO THAT'S GOOD NEWS FOR THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN. >> BUT I'M JUST CURIOUS, SO\nPATRICIA, IN INVITING THESE CLINTON ACCUSERS TO THE DEBATE,\nWAS THAT A WINNING STRATEGY, THEN?\nIS THAT WHAT THIS MEANS, THAT ESSENTIALLY THEIR PRESENCE\nRATTLED HILLARY CLINTON, SHE WASN'T ON HER A-GAME AND IT\nREMINDED VOTERS OF THE CLINTON PAST?\n>> WELL, I THINK IF DONALD TRUMP'S GOAL WAS TO RATTLE\nHILLARY CLINTON, GET HER OFF HER GAME, I THINK HE PROBABLY DID DO\nTHAT. BUT THAT SHOULDN'T BE HIS GOAL\nRIGHT NOW. HIS GOAL IS TO WIN MORE VOTERS\nOVER THAN HE HAS ALREADY. HE IS LOSING THIS RACE IN KEY\nBATTLEGROUND STATES, HE'S LOSING PARTICULARLY WE ALL KNOW THIS,\nAMONG COLLEGE EDUCATED WHITE WOMEN.\nMITT ROMNEY WON THAT GROUP BY SIX POINTS.\nDONALD TRUMP IS LOSING THEM BY 25 POINTS.\nTHOSE ARE NUMBERS YOU CANNOT AND WILL NOT MAKE UP THIS GROUP AND\nWE KNOW THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, ABOUT HIS\nTEMPERAMENT, THEY CALL HIM A BULLY.\nTHEY DON'T LIKE THE LANGUAGE HE'S USED.\nSO INSTEAD OF GOING THE OTHER DIRECTION, HE REALLY DOUBLED\nDOWN ON THAT. HE BROUGHT IN THE BILL CLINTON\nACCUSERS. HE CALLED HILLARY CLINTON A LIAR\nNINE TIMES. HE DISMISSED WHAT MANY WOMEN\nCONSIDER TO BE TALK ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT AS JUST LOCKER ROOM\nBANTER, IT'S JUST WORDS. THAT IS SO DEEPLY OFFENSIVE TO\nWOMEN, TO PARENTS, TO ANYBODY WHO HAS A SON OR DAUGHTER TRYING\nTO RAISE THEM UP TO BE BETTER. HE MAY HAVE WON OVER HARDCORE\nTRUMP SUPPORTERS, SHOULD I JUST PUBLICLY DENOUNCE HIM, YEAH, HE\nSTOPPED THAT BLEEDING. BUT HE DID NOT WIN OVER THE\nWOMEN VOTERS THAT HE NEEDED LAST NIGHT.\n>> SO MARK, WHAT WILL THIS CALL REALLY BE LIKE?\n>> WELL, CERTAINLY THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME CONCERN, CAROL, YOU\nKNOW, FROM RANK AND FILE MEMBERS CONCERNED ABOUT RUNNING FOR\nRE-ELECTION AND PAUL RYAN I THINK IS PROBABLY GOING TO SAY\nTO THEM YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO WHICH HE HAS\nBASICALLY SAID FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.\nAS MANU POINTED OUT, HE HAS RELUCTANTLY ENDORSED DONALD\nTRUMP. TOOK HIM AWHILE.\nIT WAS REALLY A PUSH AND A PULL. IN TERMS OF THE HILLARY CLINTON\nKNOCKOUT PUNCH LAST NIGHT, I THINK THAT'S A NARRATIVE THAT IS\nALMOST TOO EASY, BECAUSE I DON'T THINK SHE COULD HAVE DELIVERED\nTHE KNOCKOUT PUNCH LAST NIGHT. THE ONLY PERSON WHO COULD HAVE\nKNOCKED HIMSELF OUT LAST NIGHT WAS DONALD TRUMP.\nHE'S STILL GOT CORE SUPPORT. HAD SHE GONE FOR THE KNOCKOUT\nPUNCH, IT COULD HAVE BOOMERANGED BACK ON HER.\nTHERE WERE AT LEAST THREE WOMEN IN THAT AUDIENCE, THREE WOMEN\nTHAT WERE THERE, THAT ACCUSED HER HUSBAND OF SEXUALLY\nATTACKING THEM BASICALLY. TOUGH POSITION TO BE IN.\n>> SO LARRY, YOU HAVE BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME.\nAS YOU WERE WATCHING THE DEBATE LAST NIGHT, BECAUSE HERE'S THE\nTHING THAT'S REALLY STRANGE. SO MOST PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT\nHILLARY CLINTON WON THE DEBATE, BUT THEY SAY REALLY, IT WAS\nDONALD TRUMP WHO WON BECAUSE HE PERFORMED ABOVE EXPECTATIONS,\nBUT THE BAR WAS SO LOW THAT IS THAT REALLY WINNING?\n>> CAROL, IF YOU CAN HAVE A DEBATE WHERE BOTH CANDIDATES WON\nFOR DIFFERENT REASONS, THAT WAS LAST NIGHT'S DEBATE.\nDONALD TRUMP KNOCKED THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, WON THE DEBATE\nBECAUSE HE STOPPED SOME OF THE BLEEDING AND MADE IT MUCH MORE\nDIFFICULT FOR REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP FIND SOME REASON,\nSOME WAY TO GET HIM OFF THE TICKET.\nI DON'T BELIEVE THEY EVER COULD HAVE ANYWAY SO HE'S IN A BETTER\nPOSITION AND HIS BASE, NOT THE REPUBLICAN BASE AS A WHOLE, BUT\nHIS PERSONAL BASE LOVED THOSE ATTACKS ON HILLARY CLINTON AND\nBILL CLINTON. HERE'S WHY HILLARY CLINTON WON.\nAS YOUR POLLS SHOWED, PEOPLE RESPECTED THE WAY SHE APPROACHED\nTHE DEBATE SUBSTANTIVELY, FACTUALLY, BETTER THAN DONALD\nTRUMP. LAST OF ALL, THE LAST THING\nHILLARY CLINTON WANTED WAS TO FACE ANOTHER CANDIDATE TO HAVE A\nSUBSTITUTION MADE. SHE IS BEAUTIFULLY POSITIONED,\nAT MY SHOP, THE CRYSTAL BALL, WE HAVE HER NOW AT 341 ELECTORAL\nVOTES. YOU ONLY NEED 270.\nI HAVE LISTENED TO WHAT MARK PRESTON HAS BEEN SAYING THE LAST\nCOUPLE DAYS. HE'S ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.\nTHIS ELECTION, I'M NOT GOING TO SAY IT'S COOKED AND DONE BUT I\nSMELL IT COOKING. >> OKAY.\nSO WE ARE GOING TO TALK MUCH MORE ABOUT THAT AFTER A BREAK.\nYOU GUYS WILL STICK AROUND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MANU, WHO HAS\nTO GET BACK TO WORK AND TALK",

WILL MORE MEMBERS OF HIS PARTY\nINCLUDING THE SPEAKER, MAYBE EVEN HIMSELF, DECIDE TO DROP\nDONALD TRUMP? IT IS AMAZING THAT THIS\nDISCUSSION IS EVEN HAPPENING 30 DAYS OUT FROM THIS ELECTION.\nAS YOU KNOW, SOME TWO DOZEN REPUBLICANS HAVE ALREADY PULLED\nTHEIR SUPPORT AND SEVERAL HAVE NOW CALLED ON DONALD TRUMP TO\nDROP OUT OF THE RACE. THIS FOLLOWED THE RELEASE OF THE\n2005 \"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD\" TAPE IN WHICH DONALD TRUMP IS HEARD\nBRAGGING ABOUT GROPING WOMEN.

HE HAS BEEN MONITORING HOUSE\nREPUBLICANS ALL MORNING. DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR HOUSE\nSPEAKER IS? WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO\nHAPPEN ON THIS CALL THAT SHOULD BE UNDER WAY?\n>> Reporter: THEY ARE PROBABLY JUST GETTING STARTED RIGHT NOW.\nWHAT WE ARE HEARING THIS MORNING TALKING TO REPUBLICAN OFFICIALS\nAND SOURCES, THEY ARE TELLING ME THEY ARE EXPECTING THE\nREPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP TO MOSTLY STAY BEHIND, STICK BEHIND DONALD\nTRUMP. THAT MEANS INCLUDING PAUL RYAN,\nTHE HOUSE SPEAKER. I'M TOLD BY RYAN OFFICIAL THAT\nTHERE'S BEEN NO CHANGE IN PAUL RYAN'S POSITION AT THIS TIME SO\nWHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT HE IS STILL SUPPORTING DONALD TRUMP SO\nOF COURSE, THAT'S VERY SIGNIFICANT AFTER THAT VERY\nPUBLIC REBUKE ON SATURDAY WHEN PAUL RYAN DISINVITED DONALD\nTRUMP FROM COMING TO A UNITY RALLY IN WISCONSIN AND AFTER\nDONALD TRUMP, OF COURSE THAT VIDEOTAPE WITH VERY CRUDE\nCOMMENTS ABOUT HIM BRAGGING ABOUT GROPING WOMEN, REALLY\nPUTTING HIS PARTY ON THE DEFENSIVE AND PROMPTING A MASS\nREVOLT AMONG A LOT OF REPUBLICANS.\nWHAT HAS PUT THE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP IN A DIFFICULT SPOT,\nPARTICULARLY ON THE HOUSE SIDE, IS A LOT OF THESE MEMBERS ARE\nFROM DISTRICTS WITH A LOT OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS SO IT'S VERY\nDIFFICULT FOR THE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP PER SE TO COMPLETELY\nABANDON THEIR NOMINEE WHEN THEIR OWN CONFERENCE, THEIR MEMBERS\nWERE RUNNING FOR RE-ELECTION AND NEED THE TRUMP SUPPORTERS IN THE\nFALL. SO THERE'S ALSO, I'M TOLD, SOME\nPEOPLE ARE A LITTLE MORE RELIEVED AFTER LAST NIGHT'S\nDEBATE PERFORMANCE. THEY BELIEVE IT SHIFTED THE\nNARRATIVE AWAY FROM THE VIDEOTAPE FROM OVER THE WEEKEND\nAND PERHAPS RALLIED THE BASE AS WELL.\nTHAT MAKES IT MUCH HARDER FOR REPUBLICAN LEADERS TO GO AGAINST\nTHEIR BASE, ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE ENERGIZED FOLLOWING DONALD\nTRUMP'S DEBATE PERFORMANCE. RIGHT NOW, PAUL RYAN STICKING\nWITH DONALD TRUMP. >> DID YOU EXPECT PAUL RYAN TO\nCOME OUT AND SAY WITH ACTUAL OUT LOUD WORDS AT ANY POINT TODAY\nTHAT HE IS STILL PLANNING TO VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP?\n>> Reporter: NO GUIDANCE ON THAT YET, JOHN AND KATE.\nWHAT WILL BE VERY INTERESTING TO SEE IS THE MESSAGE THAT HE\nDELIVERS TO HIS CONFERENCE",

SOME DIRECTION, WE THINK, ON\nWHAT PAUL RYAN WILL AND WILL NOT DO FOR DONALD TRUMP GOING\nFORWARD. OUR SENIOR POLITICAL REPORTER\nMANU RAJU MONITORING THIS CALL FOR US.\nI THINK WE HAVE SOME BIG NEWS HERE.\n>> Reporter: YEAH, WE DO HAVE SOME BIG NEWS.\nPAUL RYAN SAYING HE'S DONE DEFENDING DONALD TRUMP, SAYING\nTHAT ON A CONFERENCE CALL WITH REPUBLICAN MEMBERS JUST NOW, I\nWANT TO READ YOU SOME NOTES FROM SOMEONE WHO WAS ON THE CALL\nSENDING ME AN E-MAIL ABOUT HOW IT WENT DOWN.\nTHE SPEAKER AND REPUBLICAN LEADERS WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE\nPOLITICAL LANDSCAPE. WHAT THEY WANTED TO FOCUS ON IS\nTHEY WILL ONLY WORRY ABOUT THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY GOING\nFORWARD. THEY BELIEVE THAT'S WHERE THEY\nWANT TO SPEND ALL THEIR ENERGY FOR THE NEXT MONTH, NOT ON\nHELPING DONALD TRUMP. THEY ARE SAYING THE SPEAKER TOLD\nREPUBLICAN MEMBERS QUOTE, YOU ALL NEED TO DO WHAT'S BEST FOR\nYOU IN YOUR DISTRICT. THAT MEANS THAT IF YOU NEED TO\nABANDON DONALD TRUMP, YOU SHOULD ABANDON DONALD TRUMP.\nIF YOU NEED TO RUN WITH DONALD TRUMP, RUN WITH DONALD TRUMP.\nBUT WHAT THE SPEAKER SAID VERY CLEARLY, THAT HE WILL NOT DEFEND\nTRUMP OR THE CAMPAIGN OR DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN FOR THE NEXT\nMONTH. HE ALSO SAID THAT HIS ENTIRE\nENERGY IS GOING TO BE FOCUSED ON TRYING TO KEEP THE REPUBLICAN\nMAJORITY. WHY?\nBECAUSE HE WANTS IT TO BE A CHECK ON A DEMOCRATIC\nADMINISTRATION. HE SAID THAT HE DOES NOT WANT TO\nGIVE A BLANK CHECK TO A DEMOCRATIC-CONTROLLED WHITE\nHOUSE, DEMOCRATIC-CONTROLLED CONGRESS OR HILLARY CLINTON\nADMINISTRATION. SO THAT COULD BE INTERPRETED IN\nSOME WAYS AS THROWING IN THE TOWEL, SAYING THAT DONALD TRUMP\nHAS NO CHANCE OF WINNING SO WE NEED TO WORRY ABOUT ENSURING\nTHAT IF HILLARY CLINTON DOES WIN WHICH IT LOOKS LIKE SHE MAY, WE\nHAVE A REPUBLICAN HOUSE TO PREVENT HER FROM DOING WHATEVER\nSHE WANTS. SO HE MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT HE\nIS JUST TRYING TO KEEP THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY.\nNOW, ONE THING THAT IS NOT CLEAR RIGHT NOW IS WHETHER OR NOT HE\nREVOKED HIS ENDORSEMENT OF DONALD TRUMP.\nWE WERE TOLD GOING INTO THIS FROM RYAN OFFICIALS THAT HE WAS\nNOT GOING TO CHANGE HIS POSITION AT THIS TIME ABOUT ENDORSING AND\nSUPPORTING DONALD TRUMP. SO WE ARE NOT -- IT'S NOT CLEAR\nYET WHETHER OR NOT HIS OWN PERSONAL, HE STILL PLANS ON\nVOTING FOR DONALD TRUMP IN THE FALL.\nHE'S MAKING A POLITICAL DECISION THAT IT'S TIME FOR HIS PARTY AND\nHIS PARTY'S LEADERSHIP TO WORRY EXCLUSIVELY ON THE CONGRESSIONAL\nMAJORITIES, THOSE DOWN TICKET RACES, BECAUSE SIMPLY, AT THE\nEND OF THE DAY THEY CAN'T DEFEND AL",

THAT'S NOT SHOWING REPORT.\nWHAT I HEAR, THAT'S PAUL RYAN SAYING IT'S OVER.\n>> I THINK THAT'S A COMPLETE MISINTERPRETATION OF WHAT THE\nSPEAKER IS TALKING ABOUT.

OBVIOUSLY THEY WILL KEEP THE\nMAJORITY AND HE'S GOT A LOT OF MEMBERS IN TIGHT DISTRICTS.\nHE'S SAYING HE'S FOCUSING ON THOSE INDIVIDUALS LIKE IN THE\nSENATE McCONNELL WILL FOCUS THERE.\nI THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF AN EXAGGERATION.\nWHAT HE SEES -- >> HE'S NOT GOING TO CAMPAIGN\nWITH DONALD TRUMP FOR THE NEXT 30 DAYS.\n>> EVEN MORE, I'M SORRY, I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE OTHER\nINTERPRETATION IS OF I WANT TO SPEND MY ENTIRE ENERGY MAKING\nSURE THAT HILLARY CLINTON DOES NOT GET A BLANK CHECK.\nTHE ONLY WAY HILLARY CLINTON GETS A CHECK OF ANY KIND IS IF\nSHE'S PRESIDENT. THAT DEFINITIONALLY SEEMS THAT\nPAUL RYAN IS ASSUMING A HILLARY CLINTON PRESIDENCY.\n>> THE FRUSTRATION THAT SOMEONE LIKE PAUL RYAN WILL HAVE OR\nMITCH McCONNELL IS THAT THEY SEE WHAT THE ISSUES ARE.\nTHEY SEE THE DEMOCRATS HAVE FAILED ON THE ECONOMY.\nTHEY SEE THAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE NOT MAKING US SAFER.\nBUT THEY SEE THE MEDIA ONLY TALKING ABOUT DIRT, NOT TALKING\nABOUT THE REAL ISSUES IN THIS RACE, AND THE REAL ISSUES THAT\nARE GOING TO MOVE AMERICANS -- >> I'M SORRY, WHO CALLED THE\nPRESS CONFERENCE WITH BILL CLINTON'S ACCUSERS LAST NIGHT\nAND BROUGHT UP THAT DIRT? I JUST WANT TO SAY ONE THING.\n>> IT'S A RESPONSE TO HER DIRT. >> THERE'S AN IMPORTANT POINT TO\nBE MADE HERE. PAUL RYAN IS SPEAKER OF THE\nHOUSE. THE HOUSE IS SUPPOSED TO BE LOCK\nSOLID FOR REPUBLICANS AND HE IS NOW SO WORRIED ABOUT THE DONALD\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN THAT HE IS WORRIED ABOUT THE MAJORITY IN\nTHE HOUSE. WE'RE NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT THE\nSENATE ANYMORE. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT\nREPUBLICANS WERE CHEERED AT ALL BY DONALD TRUMP'S PERFORMANCE\nLAST NIGHT, THEY ARE NOT THINKING THIS MAN CAN WIN.\nTHEY ARE THINKING MAYBE WE CAN KEEP IT TO SIX POINTS INSTEAD OF\nDOUBLE DIGITS HERE AND PAUL RYAN HAS BASICALLY -- THIS IS\nUNPRECEDENTED. IT'S REALLY REMARKABLE.\n>> SCOTTIE, HELP OUT JOHN HERE. >> FIRST, PAUL RYAN EVER\nDEFENDED DONALD TRUMP? WE HEARD THE FIRST -- HE HAS HAD\nNO HELP. IF WE HAVE SEEN --\n>> HE WAS SUPPOSED TO CAMPAIGN WITH HIM THIS WEEKEND.\n>> WHEN HE WENT THERE AND DONALD TRUMP WASN'T THERE HE GOT BOOED.\nTHERE HAS BEEN A LARGE DISCONNECT BETWEEN WASHINGTON,\nD.C.

THE FACT THAT PEOPLE LOSE, IF\nTHE HOUSE MEMBERS LOSE IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF DONALD TRUMP.\nIT'S BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T REPRESENT THEIR VOTERS FOR THE\nLAST TWO YEARS. >> DAVID, YOUR TAKE?\n>> I THINK FROM WHAT WE JUST HEARD WHICH IS BASICALLY AN\nATTACK FROM A TRUMP SUPPORTER ON PAUL RYAN, WE ARE SEEING A REAL\nCLEAVAGE IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\nIT GOES TO WHAT DONALD TRUMP'S STRATEGY WAS LAST NIGHT AND WHY\nTHE SPEAKER IS RECOGNIZING REALITY THIS MORNING CUTTING HIM\nLOOSE. THAT STRATEGY LAST NIGHT OF\nGOING TABLOID, OF CALLING HILLARY CLINTON TO GO TO JAIL,\nWAS DOUBLING DOWN ON THIS ALT-RIGHT BASE STRATEGY AND IT\nMADE ME WONDER, IS DONALD TRUMP REALLY IN THIS TO BE PRESIDENT\nOR IS HE TRYING TO MONETIZE THIS FOR SOME BREITBART TV NETWORK?\nBECAUSE THAT'S WHO HE APPEALED TO LAST NIGHT.\nTHE CLINTON HATERS IN HIS BASE. >> THE CONTROL ROOM JUST TOLD ME\nHILLARY CLINTON CAME OUT WITH A TWEET ON THIS.\nCAN YOU GUYS REPEAT WHAT HILLARY CLINTON JUST SAID?\nIF YOU HAVE IT, PUT IT ON THE SCREEN?\nHILLARY CLINTON SAYS RYAN IS STILL ENDORSING TRUMP.\nNOW, I'M NOT SURE HILLARY CLINTON'S DIALED INTO THIS\nCONFERENCE CALL. MAYBE SHE HAS SOME LANGUAGE WE\nARE NOT AWARE OF YET. BUT IT'S INTERESTING HERE\nBECAUSE NOW THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN OR DEMOCRATS ARE IN AN\nINTERESTING POSITION. EITHER THEY WANT TO CREATE --\nTHEY WANT TO CLEAVE DONALD TRUMP FROM REPUBLICANS TO TRY TO PICK\nOFF MAYBE MODERATE REPUBLICANS, OR THEY WANT TO TIE --\n>> KEEP TYING THEM TOGETHER. >> THEY WANT TO TIE THEM\nTOGETHER. BECAUSE THEY SEE THAT THE HOUSE\nCOULD LEGITIMATELY BE IN PLAY. SO THIS HAS BEEN THE STRATEGY\nDOWN BALLOT THE WHOLE TIME EVEN FOR FOLKS WHO HAVE ALREADY\nDISENDORSED DONALD TRUMP. THEY ARE SAYING THIS IS SOMEONE\nWHO STOOD WITH HIM, THIS IS SOMEONE WHO AGREES WITH HIM ON\nX, Y, Z ISSUES BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT'S THE WAY TO GO TO\nHAVE A CHANCE TO TAKE BECOACK T HOUSE.\nIT'S STILL A LONG SHOT BUT WE ALSO NEED TO KEEP OUR EYES OPEN\nHERE. DOES ANYONE REALLY THINK THIS IS\nTHE ONLY TAPE OF DONALD TRUMP THAT'S OUT THERE?\n>> NO. >> DOES ANYONE REALLY THINK\nTHERE ARE WOMEN OUT THERE WHO ARE THINKING HE SAYS THESE ARE\nWORDS AND NOT DEEDS? I HAVE PROOF OTHERWISE?\nSO PAUL RYAN AND MIKE PENCE FOR THAT MATTER SEEM TO BE KEEPING\nTHEIR OPTIONS OPEN THAT IF THEY GET EVIDENCE THAT THIS WAS NOT\nJUST WORDS BUT DEEDS, THEY STILL HAVE AN EXIT HATCH HERE.\n>> THAT WAS IRRESPONSIBLE FOR YOU TO SAY.\n>> LAY IT OUT. [ SPEAKING SIMULTANEOUSLY ]\n>> HANG ON. >> THERE WERE NEWS REPORTS\nYESTERDAY THAT STRONGLY SUGGESTED PEOPLE AFFILIATED WITH\nTHIS \"APPRENTICE\" SHOW SAY THEY HAVE TAPES THAT WERE MUCH WORSE\nTHAN WHAT WE SAW ON FRIDAY, IF YOU CAN BELIEVE THAT.\n>> THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.\nALL YOU WANT PEOPLE TO DO IS TALK ABOUT DIRT BECAUSE YOU\nDON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT ISSUES. YOU ARE NOT CAPABLE OF DEALING\nWITH THE ISSUES. >> WE WILL TAKE A QUICK BREAK.\nHAVE YOU SEEN THE TAPES? >> NO.\nWE ARE TRYING TO GET THEM. WE OFFERED MONEY FOR THEM\nACTUALLY TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD WITH DONALD TRUMP WHO\nSPENT HIS MONEY TO SHUT THESE PEOPLE UP.\nPEOPLE NEED TO HEAR THESE TAPES. >> AS OF NOW YOU HAVEN'T SEEN\nTAPES, YOU ARE SPECULATING. LET'S MAKE THAT CLEAR.\n>> I SAW A NEWS REPORT YESTERDAY WITH A PRODUCER WHO SAID THERE\nARE SUCH. >> WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.",

I DON'T THINK THIS IS JUST ABOUT\nPAUL RYAN TRYING TO PRESERVE THE HOUSE.\nIT WOULD TAKE A LOT MORE THAN WE'VE SEEN FOR THEM TO LOSE THE\nHOUSE MAJORITY.

AN INITIAL GLIMPSE OR WHERE THE\nCAMPAIGN WAS AS THIS WAS BREAKING, ONE OF THE REASONS\nREPUBLICANS ARE NERVOUS.

DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER\nGOES ON TELEVISION LAST NIGHT AND SAYS THIS --\n>> HE IS VERY GRACIOUS.

THEY THINK THIS IS NOT THE LAST\nPIECE OF OP-ED. >> A MID-TERM GAME HERE, RIGHT?\nIN THE MIDDLE, PAUL RYAN, SETTING THE GROUNDWORK FOR WHEN\nTHE NEXT PIECE OF OP-ED COMES. THERE'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER ONE.\nPART OF MY RIGHT WINGER SOUL LOOKS AT HIM, VICTIMS, ACCUSERS,\nLOOK, DEMOCRATS HAVEN'T A BIG ENOUGH PRICE FOR WEINER AND\nCLINTON'S VERY BAD BEHAVIOR, BUT DOES IT REACH ANYONE OTHER THAN\nMY WEINER SOUL AND THE FOLKS -- I DON'T THINK THEY CARE.\n>> DISAGREEMENTS WITH A PARTY, HAPPEN, NOT USUALLY THESE\nISSUES, BUT DISAGREEMENTS INNER CAMPAIGN.\nCLINTON AND SANDERS WORKED THEIRS OUT.\nHE'S BEHAVING RESPONSIBLY AND BEING NICE TO SECRETARY CLINTON.\nFOR KELLYANNE CONWAY TO SAY YOU'RE RUNNING FROM MY GUY\nBECAUSE PEOPLE ARE CALLING MY GUY A PRESIDEDATOR, YOU'RE\nPREDATORS, TOO. THAT IS NOT --\n>> KELLYANNE CONWAY, STALKING ABOUT REPUBLICAN ON REPUBLICAN\nVIOLENCE. EVERY FOUR YEARS WE HEAR FROM\nWITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, I FEEL LIKE.\nTHERE'S A NOMINEE AND THEN A FACTION ON THE RIGHT THAT SAYS,\nWELL, YOU HAVE TO BE CONSERVATIVE, OR THE ARCH\nCONSERVATIVES WON'T TURN OUT. THOSE DISAGREEMENTS ARE ABOUT\nPOLICY. THIS GUDISAGREEMENT, WHETHER OR\nNOT THIS PERSON IS FIT TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES\nAND NOT JUST THE RIGHT OR CENTER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY ARGUING\nABOUT THIS. IT IS THE ENTIRE SPECTRUM.\n>> EVEN BEFORE THIS NEWS WE'RE HEARING TODAY, THE REPUBLICAN\nHOUSE SPEAKER, THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE FOUR YEARS\nAGO, REPUBLICAN HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN UNDERSTANDS WHAT IT'S\nLIKE TO BE ON NATIONAL TICKET, TELLING THE NOMINEE YOU'RE ON\nYOUR OWN, NOT CAMPAIGNING OR DEFENDING YOU.\nEVEN BEFORE THAT DEVELOPMENT, LISTEN TO HILLARY CLINTON LAST\nNIGHT IN THE DEBATE. KNOWS WHAT'S HAPPENING AROUND\nDONALD TRUMP AND SHE LOVES IT. >> OKAY, DONALD.\nI KNOW YOU'RE INTO BIG DIVERSION TONIGHT, ANYTHING THAT AVOID\nTALKING ABOUT YOUR CAMPAIGN AND THE WAY IT'S EXPLODING AND THE\nWAY REPUBLICANS ARE LEAVING YOU --\n>> WELL, SHE'S KIND OF RIGHT ABOUT THAT, BUT IS THERE A RISK\nFOR THEM TO BE A LITTLE TAD OVERCONFIDENT?\n>> THE DEMOCRATS? >> I THINK RIGHT NOW THEY DON'T\nHAVE THAT MANY -- NOT MUCH OF A DOWN SIDE FOR THEM BEING\nCONFIDENT. I THINK THEY WENT INTO THE\nDEBATE CLEARLY, THEIR STRATEGY, FOR TRUMP TO COLLAPSE OF HIS OWN\nWEIGHT. CLINTON DID NOT GO INTO THAT\nDEBATE TO TRY AND KNOCK HIM OUT WITH A PUNCH.\nRIGHT? WHY A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING\nTRUMP DID BETTER THAN EXPECTED. HER WHOLE STRATEGY IS JUST TO\nGET HIM TALKING, YOU KNOW, PUSH A BUTTON HERE, THERE, BAIT HIM\nINTO ISSUES, AND HE'LL COLLAPSE. ALREADY COLLAPSING PRE-DEBATE,\nBUT DID A LITTLE BETTER THAN EVERYONE THOUGHT.\nNO. SHOULD BE CONFIDENT.\nLOOK AT THAT \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" WE JUST SAW.\nREPUBLICAN NOMINEE GETTING 35% IN OCTOBER.\n>> I AGREE. >> HAVEN'T SEEN HIM AS LOW AS\n35%. USUALLY BEEN AROUND THE 40% 42%\nUP THERE, SEE MORE 35% AN INTERESTING POINT TO LOOK AT.\nKEEP THE THOUGHT.",

HE DID NOT SAY THAT DONALD TRUMP\nCANNOT WIN, BUT HE DID MAKE CLEAR THAT HE DOES NEED THE\nREPUBLICANS TO STAY IN CONTROL OF CONGRESS, IN ORDER TO BE A\nCHECK ON A POTENTIAL CLINTON ADMINISTRATION.\nASSUMING IF SHE DOES WIN THEY NEED TO KEEP CONTROL OF\nCONGRESS, WHY HE WANTS TO FOCUS THE NEXT MONTH KEEPING CONTROL\nOF CONGRESS. BARNSTORMING THE COUNTRY IN\nDIFFICULT HOUSE RACES AND DOING SO WITH SENATE REPUBLICANS AS\nWERE WELL.

HE MADE VERY CLEAR THAT DONALD\nTRUMP WILL HAVE TO DEFEND HIMSELF.\nYOU KNOW, HE SAID HE WOULD NOT CAMPAIGN WITH DONALD TRUMP,\nWHICH IS NOT A HUGE SURPRISE. HE HAS NOT CAMPAIGNED WITH\nDONALD TRUMP AT ALL THIS CYCLE.

DONALD TRUMP SAYING THIS IN A\nTWEET, PAUL RYAN SHOULD SPEND MORE TIME BALANCING THE BUDGET,\nJOBS AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND NOT WASTE HIS TIME ON FIGHTING\nREPUBLICAN NOMINEE. I ASKED THE SPEAKER'S OFFICE IF\nTHEY WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT. THEY JUST SAID THE SPEAKER WILL\nFOCUS ON PROTECTING THE HOUSE AND SENATE MAJORITIES FOR THE\nNEXT 29 DAYS. I SHOULD TELL YOU, BROOKE, WHEN\nPAUL RYAN DELIVERED THIS MESSAGE INTERNALLY, HE GOT A LOT OF\nPUSHBACK FROM MEMBERS FROM CONSERVATIVE DISTRICTS WHO ARE\nLOTS OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS, WHO ARE TRUMP SUPPORTERS THEMSELVES.\nONE OF THEM SAID, LOOK, IF YOU DON'T GET -- IF DONALD TRUMP\nDOESN'T DO WELL, WE'RE NOT GOING TO SAVE THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN\nMAJORITY. THEY SAID, QUOTE, IT'S NOT\nROCKET SCIENCE. A LOT OF ANGER, A LOT OF\nACRIMONY THE DAY AFTER THE DEBATE AND PAUL RYAN LOOKING FOR\nA WAY OUT. >> I WANT TO COME BACK TO PAUL\nRYAN AND SOME PUSHBACK YOU TALKED ABOUT.\nMANU, THANK YOU SO MUCH FROM ST.

WE HAVE GRASS ROOTS SUPPORT.\nOBVIOUSLY, THEY KNEW GOING INTO THAT DEBATE HE NEEDED A SOLID\nPERFORMANCE. HE COULDN'T CONSTANTLY HAVE THIS\nNARRATIVE OF REPUBLICANS JUMPING SHIP.\nWE'LL SEE WHEN HE GETS HERE TODAY WHAT APPROACH HE TAKES.\nIF HE CONTINUES TO GO AFTER HILLARY CLINTON FOR THINGS LIKE\nBILL CLINTON'S INFIDELITIES OR FOCUSES MORE ON HER E-MAILS,\nBENGHAZI, ON WIKILEAKS, THESE POE\nPODESTA E-MAILS.

LADIES FIRST.\nCARA LEE, I'M GOING TO COME TO YOU, BEGINNING WITH, YOU KNOW,\nWE HAVE THIS UNFOLDING SHOWDOWN, MANU IS REPORTING BETWEEN\nSPEAKER RYAN AND TRUMP. YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE SPEAKER RYAN\nTODAY TELLING REPUBLICANS HE WOULD NO LONGER DEFEND HIS\nPARTY'S NOMINEE. HE WANTS TO MAINTAIN THAT\nREPUBLICAN MAJORITY IN CONGRESS. THOUGHTS?\n>> WELL, I THINK IT'S REALLY HARD TO READ PAUL RYAN'S MOVES\nANY OTHER WAY THAN HE SEES THAT DONALD TRUMP IS NOT GOING TO WIN\nTHE ELECTION AND IS TRYING TO CONSERVE WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT\nTO HIM, AND THAT IS MAINTAINING REPUBLICAN CONTROL OF THE HOUSE.\n>> YOU DO THINK HE'S GIVEN UP ON ANY KIND OF TRUMP WIN?\n>> IT'S HARD TO SEE WHAT ELSE HE WOULD BE SAYING.\nHE SAYS HE NEEDS TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE HOUSE BECAUSE THE\nHOUSE NEEDS TO BE A CHECK ON A HILLARY CLINTON AND, YOU KNOW,\nTHE THING THAT'S INTERESTING HERE, WE'RE SEEING THE ARC OF\nTHE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO AS MANU MENTIONED, IT'S MORE\nOF A FUZZ REQUEST RELATIONSHIP. PAUL RYAN HAS NEVER BEEN A HUGE\nFAN OF DONALD TRUMP. THEY TRIED TO WORK IT OUT IN THE\nLAST FEW MONTHS BUT IT'S NOT WORKING.\nAND HE CLEARLY SEEMS TO BE CUTTING TIES.\nHE IS SAYING SOME THINGS HE HAD ALREADY BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST\nFEW MONTHS, WHICH IS FOCUSING ON HOUSE RACES.\nIT'S PRETTY REMARKABLE COMING AFTER THIS DEBATE AND THEN ON\nTHE HEELS OF THE STATEMENT I THINK IT'S ALSO A REFLECTION OF\nREPUBLICANS ARE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT ELSE MIGHT BE OUT THERE.\nIS IT NOT JUST THIS Q\"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD\" TAPE, WHAT COULD COME\nNEXT? HE'S TRYING TO WORRY ABOUT HIS\nOWN TURF. >> WITH SPEAKER RYAN ESSENTIALLY\nCONCEDING HILLARY CLINTON MIGHT WIN, YOU HAVE, MIKE, THESE\nREPUBLICAN CONGRESSMEN AND WOMEN, ESPECIALLY IN THE MORE\nCONSERVATIVE DISTRICTS, WHO ARE FURIOUS, TO USE MANU RAJU'S\nWORD, ABOUT WHAT SPEAKER RYAN IS DOING.\nTHEY FEEL LIKE HE'S JUST GIVING UP ON THE SUPREME COURT, FOR\nEXAMPLE. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE BACKLASH\nAGAINST RYAN? >> WELL, I THINK WHAT YOU'RE\nSEEING, IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE WHEN YOU STOP AND THINK ABOUT IT.\nTHE COMPETITIVE HOUSE RACES, THE ONES THAT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE\nIN WINNING THE MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE ARE IN THE SWING PARTS OF\nTHE COUNTRY. THEY'RE NOT IN THE DEEP RED OR\nDEEP BLUE PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS EVEN IN THE\nSAME PLACE AS THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS BEING RUN.\nSO, IN A SENSE WHAT SPEAKER RYAN IS SAYING, THERE'S A\nPRESIDENTIAL RACE. THAT'S FINE.\nTHE PRESIDENTIAL RACE IS GOING TO BE RUN ON ITS OWN.\nI'M GOING TO WORRY ABOUT PROTECTING THE VULNERABLE\nMEMBERS OF MY CONFERENCE THAT ARE IN THE SWING PARTS OF THE\nCOUNTRY AND THEY NEED RESOURCES, THEY NEED A MESSAGE AND THEY\nNEED TO DEFEND THEMSELVES. I'M GOING TO HELP THEM DO WHAT\nTHEY NEED TO DO. THAT'S ELEMENTARY.\nHE'S THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE. HE'S NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.\nHE'S LETTING THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE TAKE ON WHAT IT'S GOING TO\nTAKE ON AND HE'S FOCUSED ON HELPING THE HOUSE MEMBERS.\nI THINK THAT'S A WISE DECISION. >> HE'S THINKING ABOUT\nDOWN-BALLOT AHEAD TO NOVEMBER 8th.\nLET'S LOOK BACK, BOB, TO THE DEBATE LAST NIGHT AND TO A\nMOMENT THAT WAS QUITE SIMPLY, UNPRECEDENTED.\nWATCH. >> IF I WIN I AM GOING TO\nINSTRUCT MY ATTORNEY GENERAL TO GET A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR TO LOOK\nINTO YOUR SITUATION BECAUSE THERE HAS NEVER BEEN SO MANY\nLIES, SO MUCH DECEPTION. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING\nLIKE IT. >> IT'S JUST AWFULLY GOOD THAT\nSOMEONE WITH THE TEMPERAMENT OF DONALD TRUMP IS NOT IN CHARGE OF\nTHE LAW IN OUR COUNTRY. >> BECAUSE YOU'D BE IN JAIL.\n>> SECRETARY CLINTON -- [ CHEERS AND ABRAUS\n[ .\n>> BECAUSE YOU'D BE IN JAIL. AND YOU HEAR -- I DON'T KNOW IF\nTHAT WAS APPLAUSE OR SCREAMS IN THE AUDIENCE.\nYOU HAVE NOW, BOB, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL, ERIC HOLDER,\nTWEETING, IN THE USA WE DO NOT THREATEN TO JAIL POLITICAL\nOPPONENTS. DONALD TRUMP SAID HE WOULD.\nHE IS PROMISING TO ABUSE THE POWER OF OFFICE.\nYOU KNOW, COMPARISONS TO NIXONIAN.\nI HEAR YOU LAUGH. TO A DICTATOR.\nTHIS IS JUST WRONG, IS IT NOT? >> IT WAS A GOOD LINE BY TRUMP.\nANY TIME HE'S TALKING ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S E-MAILS, I\nTHINK THAT'S A GOOD THING FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nAT THE SAME TIME, THERE ARE NO RULES IN CAMPAIGN AND THERE ARE\nCERTAINLY NO RULES IN THIS ELECTION CYCLE.\nTHE ONE THING DONALD TRUMP NEEDS TO TALK ABOUT MORE, I THINK, I\nDON'T THINK RAISING BILL CLINTON, ONE OF MANY POINTS.\nI THINK TALKING ABOUT E-MAILS, TALKING ABOUT ISIS, TALKING\nABOUT POLICY, IS GOOD. HE HAS GOTTEN DISTRACTED WHERE\nHE'S TALKING ABOUT MISS UNIVERSE, THE KHAN FAMILY, WHICH\nIS SOMETHING HILLARY CLINTON RAISED.\nBOTTOM LINE, I THINK DONALD TRUMP NEEDED A GAME-CHANGER.\nHE DIDN'T GET IT LAST NIGHT. >> FOLLOWING UP ON THAT, TO\nQUOTE SOME FOLKS ON TV TODAY, HE WENT FULL BRIGHTBART ON THE\nSITUATION BUT DID HE GAIN VOTERS FROM HIS PERFORMANCE?\n>> I DON'T THINK SO. CERTAINLY THE BASE THAT LIKES\nTRUMP LOVED THOSE LINES. AND IT SHOWS THAT HE WANTS TO\nGET THE BASE OUT. BUT HE NEEDS A BROADER\nCOALITION. HE NEEDS INDEPENDENT VOTERS.\nPOLLS ARE SHOWING THAT IND PEPT VOTERS THOUGHT THAT CLINTON WON.\nTHE PEOPLE THAT ARE STILL TORN BETWEEN THESE TWO CHOICES, WHO\nREALLY -- A LOT OF PEOPLE I KNOW DON'T WANT TO VOTE FOR EITHER\nONE OF THEM. THEY'RE STARTING TO LEAN TOWARDS\nHILLARY CLINTON. HE'S ONLY GOT ONE MORE DEBATE\nLEFT. >> YOU KNOW, CNN POLL INDICATED\nHILLARY CLINTON WON. THERE IS ONE MORE DEBATE.\nCAROL LEE, WHAT DID YOU THINK OF HILLARY CLINTON?\nLET'S PUT SUBSTANCE ASIDE FOR A SECOND AND JUST ON STYLE, HOW,\nYOU KNOW, SHE DEFINITELY INTERRUPTED LESS THAN,\nOBVIOUSLY, DONALD TRUMP DID, BUT SHE WAS SMILING.\nSOME PERCEIVED THAT AS SMIRKING. THEN YOU HAD DONALD TRUMP PACING\nAROUND HER. I KEEP CALLING IT ALMOST LIKE A\nCAGE MATCH. WHAT DID YOU THINK OF ALL OF\nTHAT? >> IT REMIND ME -- THESE TOWN\nHALL DEBATES ALWAYS CREATE KIND OF STRANGE BODY LANGUAGE\nMOMENTS. YOU REMEMBER THE OBAMA/ROMNEY\nDEBATE WHERE THEY WERE CIRCLING EACH OTHER IN THIS WAY.\nYOU KNOW, SHE SEEMED TO THINK HER APPROACH WAS VERY SIMILAR TO\nTHE WAY SHE TOOK IN THE FIRST DEBATE.\nSHE CLEARLY THINKS THAT WORKED WELL FOR HER.\nYOU ALSO SAW A COUPLE MOMENTS WHERE DONALD TRUMP WAS ABLE TO\nGET UNDER HER SKIN A LITTLE MORE THAN HE WAS IN THE FIRST\nDEBATED. SHE SNAPPED BACK AND SAID, YOU\nKNOW, SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF, YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT\nYOUR EXPLODING CAMPAIGNS. YOU'RE GOING TO SAY ALL THESE\nDISTRACTING THINGS. AND SO SHE -- SHE WAS VERY --\nCLEARLY DID NOT WANT TO INTERRUPT.\nSHE WANTED TO TURN THE FOCUS BACK ON TO THESE PEOPLE HAVE\nQUESTIONS. WE SHOULD RESPOND TO THEM AND\nTAKE THEIR QUESTIONS AND NOT ARGUE WITH EACH OTHER.\nAND IT WAS A REALLY CONTENTIOUS DEBATE.\nAND SHE -- LIKE YOU SAID, SHE SMILED THROUGH A LOT OF THAT.\n>> YEAH. >> THAT WAS THE DEBATE.\nTHEN THE VIDEO THAT CAME OUT FRIDAY.\nIN BETWEEN YOU THEN HAD THIS OTHER PIECE OF NEWS, WHICH IS\nTHESE BILL CLINTON ACCUSERS. THESE THREE WOMEN WHO, YOU KNOW,\nTRUMP BROUGHT INTO THE AUDIENCE. APPARENTLY HE EVEN -- HE WANTED\nTHEM TO SIT WITH HIS OWN FAMILY IN THE VIP BOX BUT THE\nCOMMISSIONER SAID, NO, THIS IS A FAMILIES ONLY AREA.\nYOU COULD STILL SEE THEM SITTING THERE.\nMIKE, IS THIS THE STUNT THAT REPUBLICANS WANTED BECAUSE AT\nTHE END OF THE DAY NOTHING UNIFIES REPUBLICANS LIKE\nATTACKING THE CLINTONS? WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THAT\nSPECTACLE? >> WELL, LOOK, IF YOU'RE LOOKING\nAT THE NUMBERS OF WHERE TRUMP NEEDS TO IMPROVE HIS BALLOT\nPERFORMANCE, HE'S TRAILING BADLY WITH WOMEN.\nHE'S TRAILING BADLY WITH MINORITIES.\nTHAT'S THE PLACE HE NEEDS TO GO. I DON'T KNOW THAT DOING THAT\nSTUNT IS GOING TO HELP THEM WITH ANY OF THAT STUFF.\nHE'S TRYING TO POINT OUT THE DOUBLE STANDARD OF HOW CLINTON\nWAS TREATED IN THE PRESS WITH THESE WOMEN AND THAT SORT OF\nTHING. YOU'RE RIGHT, I THINK THAT'S A\nPLAY TO THE BASE. I DON'T KNOW THAT IT REALLY\nHELPS BENEFIT HIM AND THE THINGS HE'S TRYING TO ACHIEVE IN THE\nCAMPAIGN. THERE'S BEEN THIS TENSION WITHIN\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN THAT'S BEEN PRETTY PUBLIC BETWEEN THE PEOPLE\nTHAT ARE SAYING, LET TRUMP BE TRUMP AND MAKE HIS OWN DECISIONS\nAND DO THESE THINGS AND PEOPLE ARE SAYING, NO, LET'S HAVE HIM\nREAD OFF A TELEPROMPTER, STICK TO TALKING POINTS AND BE\nSTRATEGIC. FOR FOUR WEEKS, DONALD TRUMP WAS\nREADING FROM A TELEPROMPTER, WASN'T TREATIWEETING AND DO THI\nLIKE THIS AND HE CAUGHT HILLARY CLINTON, THEY WERE TIED.\nLOGIC WOULD TELL YOU HE NEEDS TO GET BACK TO THAT.\nTHIS SORT OF THING IS THE DISTRACTION FROM THE STRATEGIES\nTHAT WILL GET HIM BACK INTO THE RACE.\n>> HE'S DOWN 11 POINTS IN THAT NBC NEWS/\"WALL STREET JOURNAL\"\nPOLL IN THE WAKE OF THE TAPE COMING OUT THIS WEEKEND.\nWE'LL SEE HOW HE FARED WITH DEBATE NUMBERS COMING INTO THIS\nTHIRD ONE THIS WEEKEND IN LAS VEGAS.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH.",

DANA, FIRST OF ALL, THIS CALL\nGOING ON. SPEAKER RYAN HAD HIS OWN CALL\nWITH REPUBLICANS TODAY. THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY ALL THAT\nPRETTY FOR THE REPUBLICANS. >> RIGHT, AND WHAT IS HAPPENING\nNOW IS WE TALKED OVER THE WEEKEND ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY WAS ON PAUSE, TRYING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS AT\nTHE DEBATE. THE DEBATE HAS HAPPENED, SO NOW\nEVERYBODY IS ASSESSING. THE CALL GOING ON NOW IS WITH\nTHE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIR RHEIN PRIEBUS\nAND HIS COMMITTEE MEN, PEOPLE APPOINTED TO BE ON THE NATIONAL\nCOMMITTEE FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.\nTHE HEADLINE FROM THAT CALL, I'M TOLD BY A SOURCE, IS NOTHING IS\nCHANGING. WE WERE REPORTING YESTERDAY THAT\nIT'S VERY POSSIBLE THAT THE RNC WHICH IS DOING MOST OF THE\nFUNDING AND THE GRASSROOTS GET OUT THE VOTE FUNDING FOR THE\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN COULD PULL THE PLUG.\nTHEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT. THAT'S THE MESSAGE RHEIN PRIEBUS\nIS SENDING TO HIS MEMBERS.

THE MESSAGE THAT HE SENT WAS\nEVERYBODY CAN DO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO.\nI'M NOT GOING TO DEFEND HIM, I'M NOT GOING TO UNENDORSE HIM, BUT\nI'M NOT GOING TO DEFEND DONALD TRUMP.\nWE NEED TO DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO PRESERVE THE MAJORITIES IN\nTHE HOUSE AND YOU ALL NEED TO DO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO PRESERVE\nYOUR OWN SEATS. >> BUT DOES THAT POSITION THAT\nPAUL RYAN GAVE REALLY MAKE SENSE?\nHE SAID HE'S STILL ENDORSING HIM, STILL GOING TO VOTE FOR\nHIM, BUT HE'S NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING TO HELP HIM?\nHE'S GOING TO PUT ALL HIS ENERGIES EXCLUSIVELY ON KEEPING\nTHE REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.\nTHERE SEEMS TO BE A CONTRADICTION THERE.\n>> HE'S TRYING TO TALK TO THE REPUBLICANS SAYING THEY CAN GO\nTHIS PATH AS WELL, LET ME SHOW YOU THE WAY, AND YET HE DOESN'T\nWANT TO COMPLETELY OFFEND WHAT IS THE LIFE FORCE THAT ARE CLEAR\nTRUMP SUPPORTERS. FOR MANY OF PAUL RYAN'S MEMBERS,\nTHEY NEED THE TRUMP SUPPORTERS TO SHOW UP IN BIG NUMBERS TO\nMAINTAIN THE MAJORITY. HE'S TRYING TO HAVE IT BOTH\nWAYS, WHICH IS NOT REALLY A STRONG POSITION FOR A LEADER TO\nTRY AND DO, BUT I THINK IT EXEMPLIFIES THE BIND THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY IS IN RIGHT NOW.\nWE SAW THE ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS THROUGHOUT THE\nENTIRE NOMINATION SEASON, NEW HAMPSHIRE, IOWA, ALL WAIT\nTHROUGH THE PRIMARIES, TWIST THEMSELVES INTO KNOTS AS THEY\nWORRIED DONALD TRUMP MIGHT BE THE NOMINEE, AND HE KEPT ROLLING\nTHROUGH. THIS IS WHAT THEY WERE WORRIED\nABOUT. THEY WERE ENVISIONING THIS VERY\nMOMENT OF HIM GOING SCORCHED EARTH LIKE THIS AND JUST GIVING\nUP TRYING TO WIN VOTERS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY.\n>> MARK PRESTON, DOES PAUL RYAN WANT DONALD TRUMP TO BE\nPRESIDENT? >> HE CERTAINLY WANTS DONALD\nTRUMP TO BE PRESIDENT MORE THAN HE WANTS TO SEE HILLARY CLINTON\nAS PRESIDENT, BUT I THINK HE SEES THE POLITICAL REALITY THAT\nHE HAS MEMBERS, HOUSE REPUBLICANS THAT ARE IN JEOPARDY\nIF THEY CONNECT THEMSELVES TO DONALD TRUMP.\nNOW, RIGHT NOW THEY HAVE A VERY LARGE LEAD IN THE HOUSE OF\nREPRESENTATIVES. THAT'S WHY WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT\nMAJORITIES AND THE SENATE BEING VERY MUCH ON THE EJIDGE FOR\nCONTROL FOR DEMOCRATS BUT THE HOUSE NOT BEING SO, PAUL RYAN\nTRYING TO SHORE UP SUPPORT, SHORE UP FLANK ON THE HOUSE SIDE\nSO HE MAKES SURE HE HAS A MAJORITY HEADING INTO NEXT YEAR.\nBUT I DO THINK WE NEED TO EMPHASIZE THIS.\nPAUL RYAN'S FIRST JOB IS TO MAKE SURE THERE IS A HOUSE MAJORITY.\nHIS GOAL IS NOT NECESSARILY TO TRY TO ELECT DONALD TRUMP.\nIN MANY WAYS WHEN WE SAW DONALD TRUMP COME OUT TODAY AND BE\nCRITICAL OF PAUL RYAN AND PAUL RYAN STEPPING BACK AND NOT\nTAKING THE BAIT, THAT WAS VERY SMART OF HIM.\nBECAUSE THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS TO ENGAGE IN A FIGHT WITH THE\nREPUBLICAN NOMINEE, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S DONALD TRUMP, WOLF,\nNOT A GOOD IDEA. >> THERE IS A FIGHT GOING ON\nRIGHT NOW BETWEEN PAUL RYAN AND DONALD TRUMP.\nTRUMP TWEETED THIS AFTER WORD CAME OUT WITH WHAT PAUL RYAN WAS\nSAYING IN THAT CONFERENCE CALL WITH REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE.\nTHIS IS FROM TRUMP.

BUT ONE THING REALLY STRUCK US,\nIT INVOLVED CHELSEA CLINTON AND A COMMENT FROM DOUG BAND, THE\nLONGTIME ADVISER TO PRESIDENT CLINTON.\nHE REFERRED TO HER AS A SPOILED BRAT.\nAND HE WAS SENDING AN E-MAIL TO JOHN PODESTA, THE CHAIRMAN, OF\nCOURSE, OF THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN AND WAS PUSHING BACK HARD ON HOW\nTHE CAMPAIGN WAS SORT OF HANDLING SOME OF THESE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION QUESTIONS BUT USING THE TWO WORDS, POAINL OPENS SOM\nDISCUSSIONS THAT WE NEVER SEE AT ALL.\nBUT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN RESPONDED VERY SHARPLY TO THE\nFACT THAT THESE WERE BEING RELEASED AT ALL.\nVIA WIKILEAKS. THIS IS WHAT THEY SAID IN A\nSTATEMENT. THEY SAID \"IT'S ABSOLUTELY\nDISGRACEFUL THAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS CHEERING ON A\nRELEASE TODAY ENGINEERED BY VLADIMIR PUTIN TO INTERFERE IN\nTHIS ELECTION,\" THE STATEMENT SAYS AND THIS COMES AFTER DONALD\nTRUMP ENCOURAGED MORE ESPIONAGE OVER THE SUMMER AND CONTINUED TO\nDENY THE HACK, EVEN HAPPENED AT SUNDAY'S DEBATE.\nTHE TIMING SHOWS\" THE STATEMENT SAYS TO YOU \"PUTIN KNOWS TRUMP\nHAD A BAD WEEKEND AND A BAD DEBATE.\nCLEARLY HERE TRYING TO DEFLECT ALL OF THIS ON DONALD TRUMP AND\nVLADIMIR PUTIN, ANDERSON, BUT NOTE, MAJOR HEADLINE IN THIS,\nBUT CERTAINLY SHOWS HOW INTERNAL THINGS ARE AGREED UPON.\nMORE IMPORTANTLY, THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN BELIEVES THERE'S MUCH\nMORE THAT COULD STILL BE RELEASED IN THESE WIKILEAKS IN\nTHE NEXT 29 DAYS. >> JEFF ZELENY, THANKS VERY\nMUCH. REPUBLICAN CHAIRMAN REINCE\nPRIEBUS LATE TODAY SAID THERE'S NO CHANGE IN HIS RELATIONSHIP\nWITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. EARLIER TODAY AS WE MENTIONED\nHOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN SAID WHEN IT COMES TO HIS OWN\nRELATIONSHIP WITH TRUMP, THERE CERTAINLY IS.\nRYAN TELLING FELLOW REPUBLICANS HE'LL NO LONGER DEFEND THE MANOR\nCAMPAIGN FOR HIM. PLENTY OF OTHER REPUBLICANS\nWEIGHING IN AS WELL. NOT TO MENTION WEIGHING THEIR\nALTERNATIVES. CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT\nDANA BASH JOINS US NOW WITH MORE ON THAT.\nSO LET'S TAKE SPEAKER RYAN FIRST.\nWHAT DO YOU, FIRST OF ALL, HOW HE ARRIVED AT THIS DECISION,\nWHAT EXACTLY IT MEANS FOR TRUMP? >> YOU KNOW, IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT\nAT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S GOING TO MEAN FOR TRUMP BECAUSE MY\nUNDERSTANDING IN TALKING TO SOURCES WHO ARE CLOSE TO PAUL\nRYAN IS THAT HE REALLY FELT THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY CHOICE BUT TO\nBE IN WHAT IS VERY MUCH A GRAY AREA THAT EFFECTIVELY MEANS HE'S\nSENDING SOME MIXED MESSAGES BECAUSE AS YOU SAID, HE TOLD HIS\nRANK AND FILE TODAY THAT HE IS NOT GOING TO DEFEND DONALD TRUMP\nANYMORE, WON'T CAMPAIGN WITH HIM, BUT HE HAS ENDORSED DONALD\nTRUMP AND HE'S NOT TAKING THAT ENDORSEMENT AWAY.\nHE'S NOT RESCINDING THAT. SO THAT DID PROMPT SOME OF THE\nMORE CONSERVATIVE MEMBERS, THOSE IN SORT OF RUBY RED DISTRICTS\nWHO HAVE A LOT OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS AT HOME TO SAY, WAIT\nA MINUTE, HOW CAN YOU DO THIS? BY SAYING THIS, YOU'RE GOING TO\nHELP DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP AND HELP PUT HILLARY CLINTON IN THE\nWHITE HOUSE. THOSE WHO SPEAKER RYAN IS TRYING\nTO ACTUALLY DEFEND AND HELP, THEY WERE A LITTLE BIT MORE\nQUIET AND THAT I THINK IS THE KEY THING TO REMEMBER.\nHE HAS A VERY DEVE VVE VY DIVERA LOT OF REPUBLICANS ARE OKAY,\nSOME ON THE BUBBLE. HE FEELS HE NEEDS TO PROTECT\nTHEM. >> REINCE PRIEBUS CLEARLY MADE A\nDECISION TO STICK WITH TRUMP. HAS A DIGFFERENT CALCULATION.\nHOW DOES THAT IMPACT THE RNC? >> REALLY DIFFERENT CALCULATION.\nIT DOES SOUND LIKE REALLY MIXED MESSAGES FROM THE LEADERSHIP OF\nTHE REPUBLICAN PARTY. REINCE PRIEBUS' JOB OF THE CHAIR\nOF THE RNC IS TO GET REPUBLICANS ELECTED AND WHAT HE FEELS AND\nHIS SORT OF MODE ALL ALONG SINCE DONALD TRUMP BECAME THE NOMINEE\nIS THIS IS WHAT THE REPUBLICAN VOTERS SAID THAT THEY WANTED.\nSO HIS JOB AS THE CHAIR IS TO TRY TO HELP GET HIM AND ALL THE\nOTHER REPUBLICANS ELECTED. AS WE REPORTED THIS WEEKEND,\nANDERSON, BECAUSE OF THIS TAPE, AND IT WAS SO HARD FOR HIM AND\nEVERYBODY ELSE TO DEFEND, THEY WERE CONSIDERING PULLING THE\nPLUG ON SUPPORT FOR GET-OUT-THE-VOTE EFFORTS,\nGRASSROOTS EFFORTS, MONEY WHICH IS REALLY KEY FOR THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN, MORE SO THAN PROBABLY ANY OTHER PARTNERSHIP IN RECENT\nHISTORY. BECAUSE, I MEAN, JUST TO BE\nBLUNT, DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T MELT DOWN ON THE STAGE WITH YOU LAST\nNIGHT, THE RNC FEELS THAT THEY CAN'T PULL THE PLUG AND THAT'S\nWHAT HE TOLD HIS MEMBERS TODAY. NOT IN THOSE TERMS BUT SAID, YOU\nKNOW, HE'S OUR GUY, HE MADE AN APOLOGY, WE'RE GOING TO STICK\nWITH HIM AND THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND\nTHE RNC IS GOING TO CONTINUE. >> ALL RIGHT.\nDANA BASH, DANA, THANKS. CLINTON SUPPORTER, MOVE ON.ORG\nNATIONAL SPOKESPERSON COREEN JEAN-PIERRE.\nCHRISTINE QUINN. \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" NATIONAL\nPOLITICAL REPORTER ALEX BURNS. TRUMP SUPPORTER AND FORMER\nREAGAN WHITE HOUSE POLITICAL HONCHO JEFFREY LORD.\nAND COREY LEWANDOWSKI, REMAINS A TRUMP SUPPORTER TO THIS DAY.\nALEX, DID DONALD TRUMP DO WHAT HE NEEDED TO DO LAST NIGHT,\nESSENTIALLY STOP THE FOCUS ON THE TAPES FROM FRIDAY AND KIND\nOF SOLIDIFY HIS SUPPORT OR AT LEAST BOLSTER THE RNC SUPPORT?\n>> IF HIS GOAL IS TO WIN A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, THEN NO,\nI DON'T THINK HE CAME CLOSE TO ACHIEVING THAT GOAL.\nIF ME HAD REALLY HAD A TURNAROUND MOMENT LAST NIGHT, I\nDON'T KNOW THAT YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN PAUL RYAN GO THROUGH WITH\nSUCH A DRAMT ATIC ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY.\nA PARTY IN A STATE OF CRISIS UNLIKE ANY WE'VE SEEN IN MODERN\nPRESIDENTIAL POLITICS, YOU HAVE THE HIGHEST RANKING ELECTED\nREPUBLICAN IN WASHINGTON BREAKING WITH THE NOMINAL\nSTANDARDBEARER OF HER PARTY AND THE FEAR ACROSS WASHINGTON AND\nACROSS THESE CONGRESSIONAL RACES AROUND THE COUNTRY IS THEY\nACTUALLY HAVEN'T HIT BOTTOM YET THAT I'M AWARE OF.\nONE PRIVATE MOLL FOR ONE OF THE PARTIES SHOWS TRUMP LOSING BY\nDOUBLE DIGITS, NUMEROUS POLLS FROM SENATE AND GOVERNOR RACES\nFROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT SHOW HIM TANKING IN THE SWING\nSTATES. SUNLEN REFERRED KIND OF OFFHAND\nTO THIS MENTION TRUMP MADE AT ONE OF HIS RALLIES THAT MAYBE\nTHERE ARE MORE VIDEOS STILL TO COME AND I WOULD RETURN FIRE IN\nTH IF THOSE VIDEOS GOT RELEASED.\nTHE PETRIFYING FEAR AMONG REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS\nIS THERE ARE STILL SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT MORE SHOES LEFT TO DROP.\n>> COREY, DO YOU THINK -- I MEAN, DO YOU THINK WE'RE\nPAINTING TOO DIRE A PICTURE OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE RNC, DO\nYOU THINK DONALD TRUMP DID WHAT HE HAD TO DO LAST NIGHT?\n>> DONALD TRUMP WAS VERY GOOD LAST NIGHT.\nHE TALKED ABOUT HIS DIFFERENCE OF OPINION ON OPEN BORDERS\nVERSUS PRO AMNESTY. I THINK DONALD TRUMP WAS\nPAINTING THE VIPICTURE FOR WHAT HIS VISION OF AMERICA IS.\nI WANT TO TOUCH ON THE RNC FOR JUST A SECOND.\nYOU KNOW, REINCE PRIEBUS IS ACCOUNTABLE TO A 168-PERSON\nCOMMITTEE. HE'S AN ELECTED OFFICIAL BUT IS\nWL ELECTED FROM WITHIN THE\n168-PERSON COMMITTEE. THOSE 168 PEOPLE ARE THEREBY\nELECTED IN THEIR OWN STATES. THERE'S A NATIONAL COMMITTEEMAN,\nNATIONAL COMMITTEEWOMAN AND USUALLY CHAIRMAN OF THE PARTY.\nTHE RANK AND FILE WHERE THOSE PEOPLE HAVE TO RUN HAVE\nPREDOMINANTLY BEEN WITH DONALD TRUMP.\nIT'S NOT A BIG SURPRISE THE RNC IS STANDING BEHIND DONALD TRUMP.\nWHEN YOU GOAET TO THOSE PEOPLE O ARE ELECTED BY THE STATES, THOSE\nARE THE RANK AND FILE THAT HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE STATES.\nAS YOU GET CLOSER TO THE PEOPLE, THEY'RE MUCH MORE RECEPTIVE.\nTHAT'S WHAT WE'VE SEEN MANY, MANY TIMES.\nTHAT'S WHY REINCE TODAY HAS STEPPED FORWARD AND SAID AND --\nIT'S NOT PAUL RYAN, NOT MITCH McCONNELL, IT'S THE GOP NOMINEE.\n>> IS PAUL RYAN ESSENTIALLY GIVING COVER TO RANK AND FILE\nMEMBERS TO DISTANCE THEMSELVES --\n>> IF HE THINKS THAT'S WHAT HE'S DOING, THAT WILL WORK.\nLET ME JUST SAY IN THE WORLD OF CONSERVATIVE MEDIA, SEAN HANNITE\nWITH PAUL RYAN. THAT'S A BIG DEAL.\nEVERYBODY LIKES PAUL RYAN. I LIKE PAUL RYAN, BUT WHEN YOU\nSTART TO DO THIS KIND OF SITUATION, IN ESSENCE,\nSABOTAGING THE PARTY NOMINEE OF YOUR OWN PARTY, THIS GOES BACK A\nLONG WAY BEFORE PAUL RYAN. I MEAN, BOEHNER AND THE RESPONSE\nOF REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS NOT JUST TO BARACK OBAMA BUT BEFORE\nTHAT. AND SO WHAT YOU'VE GOT HERE IS A\nSPEAKER OF THE HOUSE NOW SAYING HE'S ABANDONING THE REPUBLICAN\nSHIP. THERE ARE A LOT OF REPUBLICANS\nTHAT THINK HE AND MANY REPUBLICANS IN WASHINGTON\nABANDONED IT A LONG TIME AGO, SO THIS IS ONLY THE LATEST EPISODE\nHERE. AND HE'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF\nFLAK FOR THIS AND TO THE POINT HERE, ONE OF TWO THINGS IS GOING\nTO HAPPEN. DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO WIN\nTHIS ELECTION. I THINK HE HAD A GREAT DEBATE\nLAST NIGHT. OR HE'S GOING TO LOSE IT.\nEITHER WAY, THE THINGS HE'S TALKING ABOUT, THE ISSUES HE'S\nTALKING ABOUT, I SPOKE WITH A FORMER REAGAN COLLEAGUE TODAY,\nTHESE ISSUES ARE GOING TO BE AROUND FOR A VERY LONG TIME.\nAND WHAT WE'VE GOT IS A SITUATION WITH WHAT REAGAN USED\nTO CALL THE FRATERNAL ORDER REPUBLICANS VERSUS THE\nWASHINGTON ELITES. >> WELL ALSO, I MEAN, THESE\nDIVISIONS ARE GOING TO BE AROUND NO MATTER WHO WINS COMING DOWN\nTHE ROAD. JUST IN TERMS OF GOVERNING, IN\nTERMS OF, YOU KNOW, RUNNING THE COUNTRY FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS.\nI MEAN, THERE ARE STARK, STARK DIVISIONS NOT ONLY IN THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY BUT IN THE ELECTORATE.\n>> I MEAN, LOOK, THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE AND THAT'S OFTEN\nTHE CASE AFTER A LONG, TOUGH PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION THAT YOU\nEND UP WITH THE COUNTRY KIND OF CLOSE.\nI THINK SECRETARY CLINTON AND LET ME JUST BE CLEAR, NO ONE IN\nTHE CAMPAIGN IS TAKING ANYTHING FOR GRANTED BUT IS DOING\nINCREDIBLY WELL. AND I THINK SHE'S GOING TO HAVE\nA VERY SIGNIFICANT VICTORY OVER DONALD TRUMP.\nREGARDLESS, LET'S SAY THERE'S A REAL DIVISION IN THE HOUSE, THE\nFACT THAT PAUL RYAN, THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, HAS DISTANCED\nHIMSELF FROM DONALD TRUMP, TO ME SAYS SHE'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO\nWORK WITH HIM QUITE WELL AND HILLARY HAS SHOWN OVER AND OVER\nWHEN SHE WAS A SENATOR, WHEN SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE, THAT SHE\nCAN AND WILL WORK WITH ANYONE WHEN THERE'S POTENTIAL AGREEMENT\nON A PARTICULAR ISSUE, EVEN IF THERE'S DISAGREEMENT ON ANYTHING\nELSE. SO ACTUALLY WITH THIS DIVISION,\nWHAT YOU DON'T WANT IS A BOMBASTIC DONALD TRUMP AS\nPRESIDENT. YOU WANT HILLARY WHO CAN BRING\nPEOPLE TOGETHER AND GET -- >> ALEX TALKED ABOUT THAT, THE\nFEAR AMONG SOME TRUMP SUPPORTERS ABOUT MORE SHOES TO DROP, BUT\nWITH ALL THESE E-MAILS STILL POSSIBLY TO COME OUT FROM\nWIKILEAKS, HOW CONCERNED ARE YOU OF WHAT'S IN THEM AND WHETHER\nTHAT'S GOING TO -- >> IT'S A NOTHING -- I'M NOT\nREALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE E-MAILS.\nIT SEEMS LIKE TO ME THE KREMLIN'S LAST PAYCHECK TO\nWIKILEAKS MUST HAVE BOUNCED. NO, SERIOUSLY, BECAUSE THEY'VE\nNOT BEEN EFFECTIVE AT ALL. I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THAT\nESPECIALLY WHEN YOU COMPARE IT TO SOMEONE WHO'S A SEXUAL\nPREDATOR, RIGHT, WHO'S BEEN ON TAPE SAYING THE UGLY, DISGUSTING\nTHINGS THAT HE DOES TO WOMEN BECAUSE, QUOTE/UNQUOTE, HE'S A\nCELEBRITY. >> BY THE WAY, LAST NIGHT HE\nSAID HE HADN'T DONE ANY OF THOSE THINGS.\n>> WELL, GOOD -- >> TOOK A COUPLE DAYS TO FIGURE\nTHAT OUT. >> TOOK A COUPLE DAYS.\nWE STILL HAVE THE TAPE, RIGHT? THE TAPE IS STILL THERE FOR US\nTO VIEW. BUT LOOK, HERE'S WHAT'S\nHAPPENING, ANDERSON. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS BEING\nTAKEN OVER BY THE FAR RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT WE SAW LAST NIGHT\nFROM DONALD TRUMP'S PERFORMANCE. IT WAS BREITBART.COM, RIGHT?\nIT'S ALMOST LIKE THEY LIFTED WHAT WAS FROM THE FRONT PAGE OF\nTHAT WEBSITE AND THAT'S WHAT HE DELIVERED.\nHE GAVE RED MEAT TO HIS SUPPORTERS.\nHIS HARDCORE SUPPORTERS. THAT'S ALL HE DID.\nHE DIDN'T GET ANY INDEPENDENTS. >> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE FROM\nTHE PANEL AHEAD. WE'RE GOING TO DIG DEEPER INTO\nNEW POLLING, BOTH STATE BY STATE AND NATIONAL.\nSHOWING BIG CHANGES WHEN IT COMES TO THE RACE FOR 270\nELECTORAL VOTES AND VICTORY.",

I DON'T THINK HE'S DOING HIMSELF\nANY FAVORS, BUT GOOD PEOPLE CAN DISAGREE HONESTLY, HERE'S THE\nLARGER POINT, DONALD TRUMP IN THIS ITERATION OF THE CAMPAIGN\nHAS SUR ROUNDED HIMSELF WITH AN ALT-RIGHT ROGUE'S GALLERY, AND\nTHE HYPERPARTISAN MEDIA, PARTICULARLY BREITBART, DAVID\nBOSSE, CITIZENS UNITED, WHO IN THE '90s WAS DOING\nINVESTIGATIONS AGAINST CLINTON. THEY'RE GETTING THEIR FANTASY\nBASEBALL GAME ABOUT BLOWING UP ALL OF THEIR CONSPIRACY SERIES\nBECAUSE IT'S WHAT THEY KNOW, IT'S THE PLAY THEY HAVE.\nIT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THE PAST AND NOTHING TO DO WITH THE\nFUTURE. >> IF YOU LOOK AT MATT BORGIAS,\nTHE OHIO COP CHAIRMAN, SAYING HIS WIFE WAS RIGHT ALL ALONG,\nWOULDN'T EVEN ALLOW HIM TO PUT A DONALD TRUMP SIGN IN THE FRONT\nYARD, I WONDER HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING BACK AND FORTH, CHAV\nITS SAID THE SAME THING, I SPOKE TO MY WIFE, YOU CAN'T DO IT.\n>> YOU KNOW, IT'S AN INTERESTING POINT.\nOFFENSE AFTER OFFENSE AFTER OFFENSE --\n>> SO GOES OHIO, SO GOES THE REST OF THE COUNTRY.\n>> JOHN McCAIN MENTIONED HIS WIFE AND HER WORK AGAINST HUMAN\nTRAFFICKING.

THE DEMOCRATS ARE JUXTA POSING\nIT WITH REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES AND ASSOCIATING EVERY SINGLE\nREPUBLICAN WITH THOSE COMMENTS AND FORCING THEM TO SAY, ARE YOU\nCONDONING SEXUAL ASSAULT.

WE CAN'T HAVE THE DEMOCRATS HAVE\nA BLANK CHECK, WE HAVE TO PROTECT OUR MAJORITIES TO\nBALANCE IT OUT. >> YOU THINK THAT'S WRONG, AND\nALL THE PEOPLE WHO CAME OUT ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY SAYING, WE\nCAN'T SUPPORT DONALD TRUM AM, YOU THINK THEY'RE ALREADY\nREGRETTING IT? >> I THINK THEY CONFIRM THE\nIMPRESSION OF SO MANY AMERICANS THAT PROFESSIONAL POLITICIANS\nARE JUST LIKE RATS FLEEING AT THE FIRST SIGN OF TROUBLE.\nTHAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY WERE.

HE TALKED ABOUT IRAQ?\nWHAT DID YOU THINK OF HIS ANSWER?\n>> I DIDN'T THINK THE ANSWERS WERE PARTICULARLY WELL INFORMED,\nI THINK HILLARY CLINTON DIDN'T REALLY ILLUSTRATE LAST NIGHT HOW\nSHE'D BE ALL THAT DIFFERENT FROM THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S\nCURRENT APPROACH WEREN'T EITHER TO ISIS OR SYRIA.\nI THINK DONALD TRUMP, THE ISSUE WITH DONALD TRUMP THROWING PENCE\nUNDER THE BUS, PENNSYLVANIA WAS ARTICULATING A POINT OF VIEW,\nTHAT A LOT OF REPUBLICANS HAVE ABOUT WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN WITH\nRESPECT TO U.S. POLICY TOWARD SYRIA GOING-FORWARD.\nTHE QUESTION IS, HOW DOES TRUMP DISAGREE?\nAND I THINK WHAT TRUMP NEEDS TO START TO DO A LITTLE BIT, IF HE\nWANTS TO TALK ABOUT POLICY, HE DOES NEED TO SAY LOOK, HERE'S\nWHERE I DIFFER FROM MY RUNNING MATE, HERE ARE THE TWO OR THREE\nTHINGS I WOULD DO WITH RESPECT TO SYRIA.\nHE KEEPS TALKING ABOUT KNOCKING OUT ISIS, IT'S NOT ENTIRELY\nCLEAR WHAT HE WOULD DO TO PURSUE THAT STRATEGY.\nHE NEEDS TO BE CLEARER ABOUT THAT, IF HE'S GOING TO SAY I\nDISAGREE WITH MIKE PENCE, I THINK HE HAS TO BE ABLE TO TELL\nUS HOW HE DISAGREES AND THEN THEY HAVE TO GET ON THE SAME\nPAGE AT SOME POINT. >> IT IS RELEVANT, EVERY TIME HE\nARTICULATES A POLICY IN THE MIDDLE EAST, HE ENDS UP\nESSENTIALLY PARROTING VLADIMIR PUTIN, WHERE AS YOU SAID, I\nTHINK THE RIGHT THING IS THAT -- ACTUALLY CONSERVATIVES ARE\nPRETTY ADAMANTLY AGAINST WHAT PUTIN IS DOING, AND AGAINST THE\nAGGRESSION THAT HE'S BEEN SHOWING.\nSO WHICH IS IT? >> LET'S BRING IT BACK NOW TO\nWHAT'S HAPPENING WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, WITH PAUL\nRYAN, WITH REINCE PRIEBUS AND ON AND ON AND ON.\nTHIS IS AN NBC WALL STREET JOURNAL POLL TAKEN AFTER THE\nRELEASE OF THIS TAPE, IT SHOWS CLINTON LEADING BY 11 POINTS.\nDOES THIS SUPPORT PAUL RYAN'S CONCLUSION THAT TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN\nIS IT BEYOND SAVING, HILARY ROSEN?\n>> I WISH THAT IT WERE TRUE, THAT TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN IS BEYOND\nSAVING. I'M NOT A PUNDIT WHO'S TAKING A\nVICTORY LAP. WE HAVE SEVERAL WEEKS TO GO\nBEFORE THIS ELECTION, WE CANNOT TAKE ANYTHING FOR GRANTED.\nWE HAVE SEEN THIS GUY RISE FROM THE ASHES BEFORE, AND SO I THINK\nTHAT WHAT PAUL RYAN IS DOING IS SAYING, I DON'T REALLY CARE, I'M\nGOING TO FOCUS ON OUR CAUCUS FIRST, AND WE'RE GOING TO\nDISTANCE OURSELVES JUST TO PLAY IT SAFE, BUT I DON'T THINK THAT\nMEANS THAT DONALD TRUMP IS, YOU KNOW, ALL OF A SUDDEN HAS NO\nCHANCE TO BE PRESIDENT. I THINK IT MEANS THAT PAUL RYAN\nIS LOOKING FOR MONEY AND RESOURCES TO SUPPORT HIS OWN\nCAUCUS. >> ANDRE, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF\nTHIS? BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE HAVE COUNTED\nOUT DONALD TRUMP BEFORE, AND HAVE BEEN QUITE WRONG ABOUT IT,\nDO YOU THINK THAT PAUL RYAN IS SAYING DONALD TRUMP CAN'TNO, I\nIT PRETTY WELL. PAUL RYAN'S NUMBER ONE JOB IS TO\nMAKE SURE THEY STAY IN THE MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE, THAT'S\nHIS NUMBER ONE OBJECTIVE. HE'S GOT TO FIRST AND FOREMOST\nMAKE SURE HE MAINTAINS THE HOUSE, I THINK HE'S HUNKERING\nDOWN AND FWOEK USING ON THAT, BUT I THINK IN THE BACK OF HIS\nMIND HE'S THINKING, DO WE HAVE ANOTHER BREXIT HERE, I THINK HE\nSEES THE UNDERCURRENT LIKE SO MANY REPUBLICANS, REALIZE\nTHERE'S A FRUSTRATION IN WASHINGTON WITH THE WHOLE BUNCH\nAND DONALD TRUMP IS TURNING OUT UNBELIEVABLE NUMBERS IN THESE\nFORMS HE HAS. WHETHER IT BE TOWN HALLS OR BIG\nCOLISEUMS, THE NUMBERS ARE ASTOUNDING, IT'S LIKE WHAT\nPRESIDENT OBAMA WAS ABLE TO DO. THERE'S AN UNDERCURRENT THAT\nDOESN'T SHOW UP IN YOUR POLLING. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE BEEN\nPOLLED, I HAVEN'T BEEN POLLED THIS WHOLE ELECTION YEAR,\nTHERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS OUT THERE LIKE ME.\n>> DO CROWDS NECESSARILY EQUATE TO VOTE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE\nVOTING BOOTH? >> I THINK THAT CAN BE A\nDECEPTIVE MEASURE. I THINK ALL CAMPAIGNS DOWN IN\nTHE STRETCH ARE GOING TO BE DRAWING BIG CROWDS.\nTHAT'S THE NATURE OF THE CAMPAIGN.\nI THINK ONE INTERESTING THING ABOUT THE POLL THAT CAME OUT\nTODAY, DONALD TRUMP IS LAGGING MITT ROMNEY BY 20 POINTS AMONGST\nREPUBLICANS, THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM RIGHT THERE.\nYOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP ATTRACTING 70 SOME ODD PERCENT OF\nREPUBLICAN VOTERS. I THINK THE CHALLENGE THAT THE\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS AHEAD OF THEM.\nTHEY HAVE TO REMIND REPUBLICANS OVER AND OVER AGAIN, THIS WILL\nSTILL BE YOUR GUY. I THINK IN THAT SENSE, THE\nDEBATE WILL BE HELPFUL FOR THEM. PAUL RYAN SURPRISED ME TODAY.\nI THINK HE'S SAYING, LOOK, I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON DOING WHAT I\nNEED TO DO, DONALD TRUMP WILL FOCUS ON WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO.\nLT'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS AS WE GO DOWN THE STRETCH ABOUT THERE'S A\nBIGGER QUESTION HOW THIS AFFECTS PAUL RYAN'S FUTURE PERSONALLY.\n>> LET'S NOT FORGET ONE QUICK THING, THIS WAS THE LAST WEEK\nESSENTIALLY THAT ALL OF THESE CANDIDATES FOR HOUSE AND SENATE\nARE RAISING MONEY.

              "text": "DID YOU USE THAT $916 MILLION\nLOSS TO AVOID PAYING PERSONAL FEDERAL INCOME TAXES?\n>> OF COURSE, I DO. >> OF COURSE I DO.\nONE MAJOR BOMBSHELL FROM LAST NIGHT'S DEBATE, DONALD TRUMP\nACKNOWLEDGING HE DID NOT PAY FEDERAL INCOME TAXES FOR YEARS.\nJOINING ME NOW, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST DAN SENOR.\nTHIS IS WHAT I FIND INTERESTING ON DONALD TRUMP SAYING HE DIDN'T\nPAY INCOME TAXES FOR YEARS. YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ANY OTHER\nBUSINESS LEADERS COME OUT AND SAY THIS MAKES SENSE.\nI DO THE SAME. YOU WORKED WITH MITT ROMNEY.\nTHE REST OF MITT ROMNEY'S INDUSTRY SAID HIS BUSINESS\nPRACTICES ARE EXACTLY IN LINE WITH WHAT WE DO.\nIT DIDN'T WORK FOR MITT ROMNEY. PEOPLE SEEM TO FORGIVE DONALD.\nWHY? >> I THINK TRUMP GETS AWAY WITH\nA LOT OF THINGS. TRUMP LAST NIGHT SAID HE WAS\nGOING TO PUT HIS OPPONENT IN JAIL.\nTRUMP SAID HIS POLICY ON RUSSIA, HE COULD CARE LESS IN SYRIA.\nHE HAS HIS OWN VIEW. TRUMP SAYS HE DOESN'T PAY ANY\nTAXES. LET'S JUST GO DOWN THE LIST OF\nTHE THINGS TRUMP GETS AWAY WITH THAT OTHER CANDIDATES DON'T.\nWE CAN ANALYZE WHY THAT IS. THIS IS A CHANGE ELECTION.\nPEOPLE WANT TO BLOW UP WASHINGTON.\nWHEN PEOPLE WANT TO BLOW UP WASHINGTON, THEY'RE INCREDIBLY\nSORT OF TOLERANT OF THE WARTS OF CANDIDATES.\nI THINK THE TAX ISSUE, THOUGH, IS IN A LEGAL OF ITS OWN.\nEVEN THOUGH TRUMP BLOWS IT OFF, I THINK OVER TIME IF THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN PROSECUTES IT, IT WILL BOTHER A HUGE SWATH OF THE\nELECTORATE. IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT THAT\nA PERSON OF MASSIVE WEALTH DOESN'T HAVE TO PAY TAXES WHILE\nTHE REST OF US DO. >> THEN WHAT HAPPEN IN THE LAST\n24 HOURS, IF YOU AND I HAD BEEN SITTING DOWN YESTERDAY, MY\nQUESTIONS WOULD BE, CAN THE GOP REPLACE DONALD TRUMP WITH\nANOTHER CANDIDATE? IS MIKE PENCE GOING TO LEAVE?\nTODAY, THE BEAT GOES ON. HE'S ROCKING.\nMIKE PENCE IS NEXT TO HIM. WHAT DID HE DO LAST NIGHT THAT\nWE'RE NO LONGER SAYING MORE REPUBLICAN LEADERS ARE GOING TO\nLEAVE HIM? >> AS A MEASURE OF WHAT BAD\nSHAPE TRUMP IS IN, THE DEBATE ISN'T ABOUT -- WHEN WE'RE\nANALYZING THIS, THE DEBATE IS NEVER ABOUT CAN TRUMP WIN THE\nELECTION. THE STANDARD HAS BEEN REDUCED\nTO, CAN TRUMP MAKE IT THROUGH THE NEXT FOUR WEEKS WITHOUT\nGETTING REMOVED FROM THE TICKET. OVER THE WEEKEND, EVERYONE\nTHOUGHT, OH, MY GOSH, HE'S NOT GOING TO SURVIVE AS THE HEAD OF\nTHE TICKET. AND HE DIDN'T IMPLODE LAST NIGHT\nDURING THE DEBATE. SO PEOPLE ARE SAYING, OKAY, HE\nMAY BE ABLE TO SURVIVE AS THE HEAD OF THE TICKET.\nACCORDING TO POLLING, 1 IN 4 REPUBLICANS STILL THINK HE\nSHOULD NOT BE HEAD OF THE TICKET.\nYOU CANNOT GO INTO THE GENERAL ELECTION WITH MEMBERS OF YOUR\nOWN PARTY BELIEVING YOU SHOULD NOT BE THE NOMINEE, AND WIN.\nHE'S NOT DEG TO WIN THIS ELECTION.\nBUT WE JUST THINK IT'S A WIN FOR HIM BECAUSE HE STILL GETS TO BE\nTHE NOMINEE. >> I ASKED MIKE PENCE LAST NIGHT\nABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S COMMENTS ABOUT JAILING HILLARY.\nGOING AFTER HILLARY AROUND E-MAILS, PEOPLE LOVE THAT TOPIC.\nBUT HE TOOK IT TO ANOTHER LEVEL. CHECK IT OUT.\n>> HE SAID IF HE BECAME PRESIDENT, HE WOULD APPOINT A\nSPECIAL PROSECUTOR TO INVESTIGATE HER AND PUT HER IN\nJAIL. THIS ISN'T THE CONGO.\nTHAT SOUNDS LIKE A THIRD-WORLD DICTATOR TO ME.\n>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FBI WAS CONSIDERING DOING SIX MONTHS AGO\nSOUNDS LIKE THAT TO YOU OR ANY OF YOUR VIEWERS.\nI THOUGHT THAT WAS ONE OF THE BETTER MOMENTS OF THE DEBATE\nLAST NIGHT. >> WAS THAT ONE OF THE BETTER\nMOMENTS OF THE DEBATE? >> I WAS ACTUALLY SHOCKED BY IT.\nIT'S UNPRECEDENTED IN AMERICAN POLITICAL HISTORY TO HAVE A\nMAJOR PARTY NOMINEE ON STAGE DECLARE THAT HE WILL MAKE SURE\nTHAT HIS OPPONENT WILL GO TO JAIL.\nLEAVE ASIDE BASIC RESPECT FOR DUE PROCESS AND HOW OUR JUDICIAL\nSYSTEM WORKS. THE IDEA THAT A PRESIDENT OF THE\nUNITED STATES CAN JUST PREJUDGE THE OUTCOME OF A JUDICIAL\nPROCESS AND SAY I'M GOING TO METE OUT A PUNISHMENT, PUT YOU\nBEHIND BARS. THAT'S WHAT HE SAID, WE WANT TO\nPUT THIS PERSON IN CHARGE OF THE INVESTIGATORY POWERS OF THIS\nCOUNTRY, THE PROSCUATORYIAL POWERS OF THE COUNTRY, THE\nINTELLIGENCE GATHERING POWERS OF THE COUNTRY?\nAMAZING. >> IF THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED.\nIF YOU SAY THIS IS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP LIVING ANOTHER DAY, NOT\nWINNING THE ELECTION, DO YOU THINK MIKE PENCE IS MAKING A\nMISTAKE STANDING BY DONALD TRUMP?\nMIKE PENCE WANTS TO BE A REPUBLICAN LEADER FOR THE NEXT\n20 YEARS. IN TWO MONTHS, DONALD TRUMP CAN\nSAY I'M GOING TO GO BACK TO BUILDING MOTELS.\n>> I BELIEVE MIKE PENCE HAS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO SAY SO LONG\nAS DONALD TRUMP IS LEADING THE TICKET, I CANNOT BE ON THE\nTICKET. IF HE DID THAT, DONALD TRUMP\nWOULD MOST CERTAINLY LOSE THE ELECTION AND POSSIBLY BEGIN A\nPROCESS, SPARK A PROCESS THAT WOULD LEAD TO TRUMP STEPPING OFF\nTHE TICKET. EITHER WAY, I THINK MIKE PENCE'S\nFUTURE WOULD BE IN TERRIFIC SHAPE.\nSTANDING BY TRUMP THROUGH THIS, AFTER THE VIDEOTAPE OF THE LAST\nCOUPLE DAYS, AS YOU ASKED IN YOUR INTERVIEW EARLIER TODAY,\nABOUT WHETHER OR NOT HE PUTS HIS CHRISTIANITY ABOVE HIS POLITICAL\nLOYALTY. HOW CAN HE HONESTLY SAY THAT\nGIVEN THE EVENTS OF THE LAST FEW DAYS.\nI DON'T SEE WHERE HE GOES FROM HERE.\n>> THOSE WHO SAID THIS WEEKEND THEY'RE NOT STANDING BY TRUMP,\nCOULD IT COST THEM THE ELECTIONS IN THEIR STATES?\n>> THERE'S A CORE BASE OF REPUBLICAN VOTER WHOSE ARE TRUMP\nLOYALISTS. THERE'S A RISK THAT THEY WILL\nTURN ON THEIR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IF THEIR MEMBERS OF\nCONGRESS ABANDON TRUMP, AND IF TRUMP GOES TO WERE WITH THEIR\nMEMBERS OF CONGRESS. THOSE WHO MADE THE DECISION,\nTAKE ROB PORTMAN IN OHIO, HE MADE THE DECISION TO STEP AWAY\nFROM TRUMP. TRUMP HAS A LOT OF SUPPORT IN\nOHIO. THAT'S A POLITICAL RISK THAT ROB\nPORTMAN IS MAKING. AND IT'SSTATESMANSHIP.\n>> THERE YOU HAVE IT. THANKS FOR JOINING ME THIS\nMORNING.",

I HEARD SOMEONE DESCRIBE THEM AS\nHUMAN SHIELDS, USING THEM TO PROTECT HIMSELF FROM WHAT HE\nKNEW WAS COMING WHICH WERE QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT 2005 TAPE.\nHERE'S WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAID ABOUT PAULA JONES IN 1998, THE\nWOMAN HE HAD SITTING THERE WITH HIM LAST NIGHT AS AN INVITED\nGUEST INSIDE THE DEBATE. HERE'S WHAT HE SAID IN 1998.\n>> PAULA JONES IS A LOSER BUT MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR BRINGING\nDOWN A PRESIDENT INDIRECTLY AND THAT STATEMENT WAS A BAD\nSTATEMENT TO HAVE BEEN MADE AND IT'S PROVEN TO BE FALSE.\n>> WHICH STATEMENT WAS THAT? >> PAULA JONES IN THE\nDEPOSITION. >> BUT DENIED IT.\n>> FROM 1998, THE LOSER TO THE WOMAN HE'S USING AS PART OF A\nSHIELD YESTERDAY. HOW DOES THIS PLAY WITH THE\nELECTORATES? >> WELL, HOW DOES IT PLAY?\nIF YOU WATCH TWITTER AND FACEBOOK AND SNAPCHAT ALL LAST\nNIGHT, PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT IT, BUT THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE\nWHO WERE VERY UPSET. MANY PEOPLE, WOMEN THAT I'VE\nTALKED TO, I EVEN TALKED TO CONGRESSWOMAN MARCIA FUDGE WHO\nSAID SHE WAS SO UPSET, SHE WOKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT\nAND HAD TO REALLY THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.\nAND SHE USED TO BE THE NATIONAL HEAD OF A WOMEN'S ORGANIZATION,\nA GREEK LETTER ORGANIZATION, DELTA SIGMA THETA AND ANY WOMAN\nWHO VOTES FOR DONALD TRUMP, SOMETHING IS WRONG.\nTHERE'S A LOT WRONG ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT LEVELS.\nI REMEMBER 20 YEARS AGO, I WAS HERE 20 YEARS AGO.\nWE DEALT WITH THIS BACK THEN. HE WANTS TO REHASH IT BECAUSE,\nAGAIN, AND I'M LOOKING AT IT AS DAMAGE CONTROL AND TRYING TO\nFIND THE WIND BENEATH HIS WING TO WALK INTO ONE OF THE MOST\nSACRED OF PLACES, POLITICS, INTO A DEBATE STAGE, AND THAT'S WHAT\nHE NEEDED TO BOOST HIMSELF UP TO BE ABLE TO FACE HILLARY CLINTON,\nWHO HE'S ASKING OR SAYING THAT HE WANTS HER TO GO TO JAIL IF HE\nBECOMES PRESIDENT AND ALSO, TAMRON, I TALKED TO CONGRESSMAN\nELIJAH CUMMINGS BEFORE GOING ON THE AIR WHO SAT ON THE BENGHAZI\nCOMMITTEE. HE SAID, WHAT DONALD TRUMP DID\nLAST NIGHT WAS RECKLESS, AND HE HAS NO GROUNDS.\nHE SAID THERE'S NO EVIDENCE TO COME UP TO PUT ANYTHING AGAINST\nHILLARY CLINTON, PARTICULARLY WHEN THE FBI DIRECTOR JAMES\nCOMEY WHO WAS, WHO USED TO BE UP UNTIL THE TIME HE BECAME FBI\nDIRECTOR, A REPUBLICAN, THIS IS WHAT CUMMINGS SAID, HE'S WELL\nRESPECTED. THERE IS NOTHING THAT WOULD PUT\nHILLARY CLINTON IN JAIL FOR THIS.\n>> BUT DID HILLARY CLINTON DO ENOUGH?\nSHE HAD A ROLE TO PLAY YESTERDAY, IT SEEMS, TO STAY\nCALM, NOT TAKE THE BAIT. SHE SAID THE LINE WHICH WE KNEW\nMICHELLE OBAMA WHEN THEY GO LOW, WE GO HIGH BUT WAS THAT ENOUGH\nYESTERDAY TO SEAL THIS DEAL? IT WASN'T A KNOCKOUT PUNCH AND\nWE KNOW THAT BUT WAS IT ENOUGH TO AT LEAST BOOST THOSE\nUNDECIDEDS STILL OUT THERE? >> NO, IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO SEAL\nTHE DEAL. SHE HAS TO KEEP ON TRYING.\nSHE HAS TO GET THE MILLENNIALS, THE WOMEN, THE MINORITIES.\nSHE HAS TO GET A LOT OF PEOPLE. GOING BACK TO MARCIA FUDGE.\nYOU KNOW, OHIO -- >> LET ME GET THIS IN.\nHOLD ON, REAL QUICK. GOT TO GET A REACTION.\nSPEAKER RYAN TELLS REPUBLICANS HE WON'T DEFEND DONALD TRUMP AND\nWILL FOCUS THE NEXT 29 DAYS ON KEEPING THE HOUSE MAJORITY.\nAPRIL, YOUR REACTION? >> I'M NOT SURPRISED.\nWHAT HAPPENED WAS THE LOWEST OF LOWS LAST NIGHT.\nTHIS IS SOMETHING, AGAIN, WE DEALT WITH 20 YEARS AGO.\nHILLARY CLINTON IS ON THE STAGE. HILLARY CLINTON IS RUNNING FOR\nPRESIDENT. NOT HER HUSBAND.\nTHIS MAKES SENSE. THIS IS POLITICALLY INCORRECT\nWHAT DONALD TRUMP DID. THIS IS BRINGING A WHOLE OTHER\nLEVEL OF GUTTER INTO THIS ENTIRE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION THAT IS\nSUPPOSED TO BE RAISED ABOVE ANYTHING ELSE, ABOVE THE FRAY\nAND NOW IT'S DOWN IN THE GUTTER BECAUSE OF DONALD TRUMP.\n>> LET ME GET YOU IN ON THIS AND SPEAKER RYAN SAID IN THE PAST,\nI'M NOT GOING TO DEFEND OR TALK ABOUT EVERY LITTLE COMMENT\nDONALD TRUMP MAKES. THAT WAS SEVERAL MONTHS AGO.\nWE'RE 29 DAYS OUT AND HE'S TELLING REPUBLICANS HE WON'T\nDEFEND DONALD TRUMP. HE'S FOCUSED FOR THE NEXT 29\nDAYS KEEPING THE HOUSE MAJORITY. YOUR REACTION?\n>> I THINK THERE WERE ONLY A FEW RAFTS LEFT ON THIS TITANIC AND\nWANTS THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS TO BE ON THE RAFTS.\nI THINK WHAT WE SEE IS THE PARTY IS DISINTEGRATING AROUND DONALD\nTRUMP AND THE ASSEMBLY DON'T BELIEVE HE CAN WIN AND HIS\nFAILURE, HIS LOSS COULD IMPERIL THE HOUSE MAJORITY.\nCAN YOU IMAGINE THAT? IT WAS VERY SAFE UNTIL ABOUT A\nYEAR AGO AND NOW PAUL RYAN IS CONCERNED THAT PERHAPS IT MIGHT\nNOT BE. THAT IS TITANIC.\n>> IT IS. AND RICK, NOW WE WAKE UP TO\nGOVERNOR PENCE. HE IS GOING TO CAMPAIGN TODAY.\nWE DON'T KNOW WHEN HE WILL CAMPAIGN WITH DONALD TRUMP BUT\nTHE INITIAL REACTION FROM PENCE LAST NIGHT, GREAT JOB, YOU WON\nTHE DEBATE, YOU TOOK TO TWITTER. NOW YOU HAVE SOMEONE CLOSE TO\nPENCE COMING OUT. THE HOUSE SPEAKER SAYING I'M NOT\nGOING TO DEFEND THIS GUY. WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE PARTY\nTHIS MORNING, DONALD TRUMP WAS SUPPOSED TO BRING HIM BACK INTO\nTHE FOLD WITH THE DIDN'T PERFORMANCE.\nTHAT'S NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING IF THE STATEMENT IS RIGHT.\n>> I THINK NICK'S IMAGE IS APT. THERE ARE VERY FEW RAFTS LEFT ON\nTHE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND WHAT YOU'RE WATCHING IN REALTIME, AND\nIT'S HISTORIC, THE GOP IS SPLITTING IN HALF.\nYOU HAVE ON THE ONE SIDE, ALL THE REPUBLICANS WHO ARE NOW\nSHIFTING AWAY, TAKING AWAY THEIR ENDORSEMENTS TO DONALD TRUMP OR\nBEING VOCAL ABOUT HIM GETTING OUT OF THE RACE ALTOGETHER AND\nTHEN THE BREITBART AND LOOKING AT THE POST-ELECTION STRATEGY\nAND I THINK THAT'S A BUSINESS STRATEGY.\nWOULD BE A VERY LUCRATIVE STRATEGY TO SET UP AN\nORGANIZATION THAT WOULD BE JUST PURELY ANTI-CLINTON FOR THE NEXT\nFOUR YEARS. >> A POTENTIAL OF HIM HAVING A\nYOUTUBE CHANNEL, MAYBE TEAMING UP WITH BREITBART WITH\nSUBSCRIPTIONS AND GOING BACK TO THIS WITH SPEAKER RYAN, DOES\nTHIS MEAN NOW HE SAYS I'M NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP?\nTHAT'S WHERE WE ARE AGAIN FOR THIS PARTY OR COUNTRY.\nIF YOU DON'T SUBSCRIBE TO WHAT THIS PERSON SAYS AND BELIEVES,\nDO YOU TAKE A LARGER STEP AGAINST THEM?\nWHERE ARE WE WITH THE REPUBLICANS SAYING MORE, OR DO\nTHEY NEED TO? >> LISTEN, I'M NOT SURE THERE\nARE MANY TOOLS IN THE TOOL BOX FOR HURTING TRUMP WITHIN THE\nPARTY EXCEPT SIMPLY NOT SUPPORTING HIM.\nBUT WHAT YOU MAY SEE AS THE SENATE AND HOUSE COMMITTEES AND\nTHEIR CANDIDATES PEEL AWAY FROM DONALD TRUMP IS ESSENTIALLY THAT\nHIS FIELD ORGANIZATION IS KIND OF ON THEIR OWN.\nTRADITIONALLY, YOU HAVE THE PARTY FIELD ORGANIZATION WORKING\nAT EVERY LEVEL TOGETHER. WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS A SENATE AND\nHOUSE CAMPAIGN ESSENTIALLY KIND OF GOING THEIR OWN WAY IN THIS\nWHOLE ELECTION AND LEAVING TRUMP BY HIMSELF AT THE RNC.\n>> SO THE REPORT EARLIER IN THE WEEKEND THAT THEY WOULD DIVERT\nMONEY FROM HIS CAMPAIGN, OBVIOUSLY, KELLY ANN AND OTHERS\nDENY THAT. THAT APPEARS TO, THERE MAY BE\nMORE TRUTH TO THIS POSSIBLY? >> IT'S POSSIBLE THE RNC, I\nGUESS, COULD CHOOSE TO TAKE SOME OF ITS OWN MONEY AND SHIP IT\nOVER TO THE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES.\nTRUMP CONTROLS THE JOINT FUND RAISING WITH THE RNC.\nTHEY CAN TAKE THAT MONEY AND DONORS CAN CHOOSE NOT TO GIVE\nMUCH MORE MONEY BUT THE CAMPAIGN IS OVER, FUND RAISING IS\nBASICALLY OVER. >> THAT'S THE TRUTH OF THE\nMATTER. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING\nUS, RICK. I DID WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT TED\nCRUZ. TALK ABOUT TIMING.\nHE DECIDES TO GO IN AND EVERYBODY ELSE IS GOING OUT.\nYOU CAN'T MAKE IT UP FOR HIM. THANK YOU SO MUCH, APRIL.\nWE APPRECIATE IT. A LOT GOING ON.\nAS I MENTIONED, THE BREAKING NEWS JUST COMING IN.\nSPEAKER RYAN IS SAYING HE WILL NOT DEFEND TRUMP BUT WHAT DOES\nTHAT MEAN? IS HE NO LONGER GOING TO VOTE\nFOR DONALD TRUMP? UP NEXT, WE'LL HAVE MUCH MORE ON\nTHAT AND WE'LL HEAR FROM VOTERS IN NORTH CAROLINA.\nTHAT KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE. POLLS SHOW HILLARY CLINTON\nSLIGHTLY AHEAD THERE. BUT FOLKS IN A PANEL THAT WE SAY IN AN ASSEMBLY LAST NIGHT\nDIGESTING WHAT THEY HEARD FROM BOTH CANDIDATES LAST NIGHT.\n>> I'VE SAID THAT THE UNITED STATES, THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA\nHAVE SELECTED THESE TWO CANDIDATES AS OUR ONLY CHOICES\nFOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE THEY'RE PROBABLY THE TWO WORST\nCANDIDATES WE COULD HAVE AS PRESIDENT.",

INDICATING HE IS WORRIED THAT\nHILLARY CLINTON WILL WIN AND NOW HE'S FOCUSED ON TRYING TO\nPROTECT THE HOUSE. OTHER BIT OF INFORMATION COMING\nFROM THIS CALL.

HERE WE ARE AGAIN WITH THIS\nMOMENT OF TRUTH FOR REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP.\nPAUL RYAN SAYING, HE WILL NOT DEFEND DONALD TRUMP.\nHE WON'T CAMPAIGN WITH DONALD TRUMP.\nBUT HE HAS YET TO TAKE BACK THE ENDORSEMENT.\nSO THE REACTION TO THE DEBATE ALSO STILL ALL OVER THE PLACE AT\nTHIS POINT. MANY OF THE HEADLINES CAPTURE, I\nTHINK, WHAT SOME OF YOU FELT AT HOME WATCHING IT.\nPOLITICO, FOR EXAMPLE, THIS MORNING, CALLED IT UGLIEST\nDEBATE EVER. \"THE WASHINGTON POST\" CALLED IT\nAN UNUSUALLY DARK, BITTER FACE-OFF.\nTHEY GOT UGLY AND THEN UGLIER. JOINING ME FROM THE TOWN OF\nBOONE, NORTH CAROLINA, JACOB SOBOROFF JOINS ME.\nTHESE HEADLINES SAY UGLIEST DEBATE EVER AND UNUSUALLY DARK\nBITTER FACE-OFF. THERE WAS ONE CANDIDATE ON THE\nSTAGE WHO BROUGHT IN THESE ACCUSERS, WHO BROUGHT UP SOME OF\nTHESE THINGS. THE MODERATORS ASKED DONALD\nTRUMP ABOUT THE 2005 BUT SOME SEE IT AS SOMETHING THAT HAS FELL ON THE SHOULDERS.\n>> Reporter: THE NEGATIVITY DID AFFECT SOME OF THE FOLKS I\nTALKED TO AND IN PARTICULAR, WE HEARD DONALD TRUMP YET AGAIN\nMAKE AN APPEAL TO THE YOUNG  APPALACHIAN STATE UNIVERSITY IN\nTHE TOWN OF BOONE AND OF COURSE, THERE ARE A LOT OF BERNIE\nSANDERS SUPPORTERS, FORMER BERNIE SANDERS SUPPORTERS THAT\nGO TO THAT UNIVERSITY. I TALKED TO ONE LAST NIGHT AS\nTHE DEBATE WAS GOING ON TO SEE IF DONALD TRUMP WAS WINNING HER\nOVER AND THIS IS WHAT SHE SAID. >> HILLARY CLINTON IS TALKING\nABOUT HER HISTORY RIGHT NOW, BASICALLY HER BIOGRAPHICAL\nMESSAGE, TALKING ABOUT WORKING WITH AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND\nLATINOS. SHE'S SPEAKING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE\nALREADY WITH HER. YOU THINK SHE'S WINNING OVER ANY\nNEW VOTERS TONIGHT? >> I THINK SHE DEFINITELY IS.\nAT THE BEGINNING OF THE ELECTION SEASON, I WAS A BERNIE\nSUPPORTER. AND VERY RECENTLY, I'VE BEEN\nCONFIDENT IN VOTING FOR CLINTON BECAUSE OF HER DEBATES AND\nBECAUSE OF HOW SHE'S CONNECTING TO VIEWERS IN THE WAY SHE\nPRESENTS HERSELF IN THESE DEBATES AGAINST TRUMP.\nSHE KEEPS HER COOL, ANSWERS THE QUESTION UNLIKE HE DOES AND IS\nVERY DIRECT IN THE THINGS SHE BELIEVES IN.\n>> Reporter: TAMRON, WATAUGA COUNTY HAS MORE UNAFFILIATED\nVOTERS IN REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS.\nIT'S CRUCIAL TO WIN OVER SOME OF THE VOTERS LIKE THAT YOUNG WOMAN\nI TALKED TO LAST NIGHT. IT WAS A BIG ONE ON THAT FRONT,\nAT LEAST WITH HER. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND\nPLEASE STAY WITH US. MORE ON LAST NIGHT'S DEBATES AND\nNEW STATEMENTS FROM GOVERNOR'S PENCE ABOUT THE MOMENT WHERE\nDONALD TRUMP DISAGREED WITH HIM OR APPEARED TO DISAGREE WITH HIS\nRUNNING MATE.

HE'S VERY CONCERNED CLEARLY THAT\nTHEY ARE GOING TO PERHAPS BE JEOPARDIZING THEIR CONTROL OF\nTHE HOUSE. THIS IS A SITUATION THAT A FEW\nMONTHS AGO, IT LOOKED LIKE EVEN BECAUSE OF SO FEW SWING\nDISTRICTS LEFT, DEMOCRATS WERE SAYING THEY WERE OPTIMISTIC BUT\nNOT SO MUCH TO REGAIN CONTROL OF THE HOUSE.\nCLEARLY, PAUL RYAN IS LOOKING AT THE MAP AND SAYING, THIS MIGHT\nBE DICEY. I NEED MY MEMBERS TO BE IN POWER\nTO DO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO KEEP THEIR SEATS.\n>> REINCE PRIEBUS WAS ON THE PLANE WITH DONALD TRUMP AND RUDY\nGIULIANI. SESSIONS HAD NO IDEA THIS\nPRENEWS CONFERENCE WITH WOMEN WAS GOING TO TAKE PLACE.\nANY IDEA IF THAT'S PART OF HIS LINE IN THE SAND NOW?\nTHEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE FALLOUT.\n>> HERE'S ONE REASON WHY BRINGING UP BILL CLINTON'S\nACCUSERS IS SO DANGEROUS. IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLLING FOR\nHILLARY CLINTON, OVER HER LONG CAREER, ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR\nTIMES SHE HAD WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC WAS IN 1998 DURING\nIMPEACHMENT. SHE WAS A SYMPATHETIC FIGURE, A\nWARNING THAT A LOT OF REPUBLICANS WERE TRYING TO MAKE\nSAYING IF WE MAKE HILLARY CLINTON WHO GENERALLY STRUGGLES\nWITH BEING A SYMPATHETIC CHARACTER INTO A MORE\nSYMPATHETIC ONE BY BRINGING UP THESE WOMEN, IT'S SOMETHING THAT\nENDANGERS OUR CHANCES OF THE PRESIDENCY.\nCLEARLY DONALD TRUMP DECIDED THIS WAS THE ROUTE TO GO.\n>> IT'S CLEAR AND HE BROUGHT THEM IN AND WANTED THEM TO SIT\nIN THE FAMILY OR VIP SECTION AS KELLY ANN CONWAY DESCRIBED IT.\nTHE DEBATE COMMISSION HAD TO GET INVOLVED AND SAID, SECURITY\nCOULD BE INVOLVED IF THEY TRIED TO PUT THESE WOMEN IN.\nBUT GOING BACK TO 1998, DONALD TRUMP IS AGAIN ON TAPE SAYING\nSOMETHING DIFFERENT. HE CALLED PAULA JONES A LOSER.\n>> AND SAID MY COMMENTS ON WOMEN ARE MORE CONTROVERSIAL.\nTHERE'S A WEALTH ON TAPE BUT DONALD TRUMP IS REACHING OUT TO\nSORT OF THE BREITBART AUDIENCE AND FOR HARD CORE FANS, IT WAS A\nBIG VICTORY. THEY WERE GALVANIZED ABOUT THESE\nWOMEN AND BILL CLINTON. >> MORE ON WHAT PAUL RYAN IS\nSAYING. MSNBC'S KELLY O'DONNELL HAS\nREPORTING FOR US. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US HAPPENED ON\nTHAT CALL? >> Reporter: I'VE NOT HEARD WHAT\nYOU ALREADY DISCUSSED BUT LET ME BRING THE ANALYSIS THAT I HAVE\nABOUT THIS. WHAT PAUL RYAN IS TRYING TO DO\nIS TO SAY TO MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE, DO\nWHAT IS RIGHT FOR YOU TO HOLD YOUR SEAT.\nAND REMEMBER, WE KNOW THAT OUR DISTRICTS AROUND THE COUNTRY ARE\nOFTEN JERRY GERRYMANDERED. SO THEY'VE DEEPLY RED DISTRICTS\nWHERE DONALD TRUMP HAS VOTERS ALSO GOING TO HAVE TO CONSIDER\nWHO THEY WANT TO BE THE NEXT CONGRESSPERSON.\nWHAT IS DISTINCT IS PAUL RYAN IS NOT PUBLICLY WITHDRAWING HIS\nENDORSEMENT. WHAT HE IS SAYING IS HE IS\nPUTTING HIS ENERGY AND RESOURCES AS THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE AND\nTHE HIGHEST RANKING REPUBLICAN OFFICE HOLDER IN AMERICA TO\nTRYING TO HOLD THE HOUSE AND SENATE.\nOBVIOUSLY, AFTER THE MOST RECENT DISCLOSURES REGARDING DONALD\nTRUMP, THERE'S GRAVE CONCERN IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY ABOUT A\nDOWN BALLOT DISASTER THAT IF REPUBLICANS STAY HOME BECAUSE\nTHEY'RE DISHEARTENED OR BECAUSE OF THAT SMALL GROUP OF SWING\nVOTERS CHOOSES HILLARY CLINTON AND MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE VOTED\nFOR A REPUBLICAN BUT CHOOSES NOT TO NOW, ALL DIFFERENT\nPERMUTATIONS. THEY WANT TO PROTECT THE\nMAJORITIES. IF THERE IS A CLINTON WHITE\nHOUSE, THEY WANT TO HAVE THE CHECK WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN\nPARTY. THEY WON'T EVEN GO SO FAR TO SAY\nTHEY'RE PRESUMING SHE WILL WIN. SO WHAT WE'VE GOT NOW IS ONE OF\nTHE MOST UNUSUAL SITUATIONS WHERE REPUBLICANS WHO FEEL AN\nOBLIGATION BY THEIR JOB TITLE AND BY THEIR PLACE IN THE PARTY\nTO TRY TO MAKE THE BEST OF THIS AND AT THE SAME TIME\nACKNOWLEDGING THOSE PEOPLE WHO FOUND THIS HAS COMMENTS AND\nDONALD TRUMP'S CONDUCT A BRIDGE TOO FAR, THAT THEY ARE FREE TO\nDO WHAT THEY MUST DO AND THAT IS A DIFFERENCE.\n>> SPEAKER RYAN SAID VOTE YOUR CONSCIENCE.\nHOW MANY WEEKS AGO? I MEAN, THIS WAS BEFORE TED CRUZ\nWENT DOWN. >> Reporter: THIS STRATEGY HAS\nNOT CHANGED. MITCH McCONNELL'S STRATEGY HAS\nNOT CHANGED. >> WELL, LISTEN.\n>> Reporter: NO, IT HASN'T, TAMRON.\nIT HAS NOT CHANGED. >> PAUL RYAN WAS GOING TO\nCAMPAIGN WITH DONALD TRUMP THIS WEEKEND.\nHE CANCELLED. HIS NEW STATEMENT IS HE'S NOT\nGOING TO CAMPAIGN. IS THAT NOT A CHANGE?\n>> Reporter: WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT EVENT IS A REINCE PRIEBUS\nEVENT THAT HAPPENED OVER THE WEEKEND.\nPRIEBUS WANTED DONALD TRUMP THERE WITH MIKE PENCE.\nPAUL RYAN WAS NEVER INTO THAT. THAT IS A HOMETOWN EVENT.\nNOW, OBVIOUSLY, THAT DID NOT HATCH.\nWHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS STRATEGICALLY, PAUL RYAN'S VIEW\nALL ALONG HAS BEEN DO WHAT IS BEST FOR THE HOUSE MAJORITY AND\nTO THE EXTENT THAT THEY CAN HELP SENATE CANDIDATES.\nMITCH McCONNELL IS IN THE SAME POSITION.\nTHEY HAVE MADE IT CLEAR, BOTH McCONNELL AND RYAN, THEIR\nDISAGREEMENTS, THEIR DISAT A  TRUMP CANDIDACY BUT WITH THE\nCRISIS, THEY HAVE TO CHECK IN WITH MEMBERS, CHECK IN WITH\nTHEIR DONORS, TALK ABOUT THEIR GROUND GAME.\nSO STRATEGICALLY, THINGS HAVE NOT CHANGED.\nTACTICALLY, THEY ARE CHANGING BY TRYING TO OFFER THIS\nREASSURANCE, TRYING TO ASSESS THE DAMAGE AND THAT'S WHAT I'M\nSAYING. WE KNOW THAT PAUL RYAN WAS NEVER\nA FAN OF DONALD TRUMP. LET'S BE HONEST.\nBUT WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO TODAY AFTER THE DEBATE, AFTER THE\nDISCLOSURES, TO HAVE THIS SORT OF PHONE MEETING WHICH IS A\nREGULAR THING THEY DO WITH THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE TO\nSHARE IDEAS. THIS IS NOT A GOOD TIME IN THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY. >> THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT.\n>> Reporter: YES, WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO\nWHAT THEY HAVE TO DO WITH RACES IN JUST 30 DAYS, FORM LOTS OF\nMEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND SENATE CANDIDATES AND THE FUTURE OF THE\nPARTY. THAT'S WHERE THEIR FOCUS IS\nRIGHT NOW. TAMRON?\n>> I THINK YOU MADE THE POINT OF STRATEGIC AND TACTICS.\nIT MAKES SENSE. IT MEANS NOTHING TO PEOPLE AT\nHOME WHO HEARD THE HOUSE SPEAKER SAID I WILL NOT DEFEND THE\nPERSON WHO IS THE NOMINEE FOR MY PARTY.\nI WILL NOT CAMPAIGN, WHATEVER THE NUANCES OF THAT EVENT ON THE\nWEEKEND, ABSOLUTELY. BUT A HOUSE SPEAKER SAYING I\nWILL NOT DEFEND HIM, AND BASICALLY WON'T BE SEEN ON THE\nSTAGE WITH HIM. >> Reporter: THE MUSLIM BAN.\nAND SO THAT IS THE POINT I'M MAKING ABOUT IT.\nI DON'T THINK WE'RE IN A DRAMATICALLY NEW PLACE.\nWE HAVE NEW EXAMPLES REINFORCING THE SAME AWFUL POSITIONS THAT\nREPUBLICANS ARE IN. AND IT'S WORTHY OF THEM HAVING\nTHEIR MEETINGS AND TALKING TO THEIR DONORS AND DOING ALL OF\nTHAT BECAUSE THERE'S MORE ON THE BALLOT THAN JUST THE WHITE HOUSE\nAS SIGNIFICANT AS THAT IS. >> KERRY IS WITH US AS WELL.\n>> Reporter: TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT.\n>> I AGREE WITH YOU BUT 29 DAYS OUT AND WE CAN, I DON'T READ THE\nTEA LEAVES. I HEAR WHAT PEOPLE SAY.\nAND WHAT YOU HAVE THE SPEAKER SAY I WON'T DEFEND THIS PERSON\nAFTER THESE 2005 TAPES, WE KNOW THERE'S BEEN NO LOVE BETWEEN\nTHEM. WE KNOW THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS\nSAID THINGS ABOUT SPEAKER RYAN HOLDING OUT HIS ENDORSEMENT,\nEVEN THOUGH RYAN WENT ON TO WIN THAT PRIMARY.\nWE CAN KID OURSELVES HERE ALL DAY LONG BUT I DON'T THINK\nPEOPLE AT HOME, AVERAGE PEOPLE WHO WATCH THAT DEBATE AND HEARD\nTHIS SEE IT IN THIS WONKY WAY THAT WE CAN.\n>> IT'S BEEN PROBLEMATIC NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF FRIDAY'S\nDISCLOSURE BUT THEN DONALD TRUMP'S DEBATE PERFORMANCE.\nIT HAD NOT BEEN A REPEAT OF HIS FIRST DEBATE PERFORMANCE,\nTOTALLY UNPREPARED, NOT AGGRESSIVE AND NOT TAKING ON\nHILLARY CLINTON. IT MAY HAVE FURTHER EMPOWERED\nTHE REPUBLICANS TO FINALLY WALK AWAY FROM DONALD TRUMP.\nINSTEAD, HE REALLY GALVANIZED HIS BASE.\nTHERE WERE PLENTY OF REPUBLICANS ON THE RIGHT THAT HE WON, DID A\nGREAT JOB. THAT WAS A BIG IMPROVEMENT FOR\nTHEM. SO IF YOU'RE A JOHN McCAIN OR A\nKELLY AYOTTE OR A PAT TOOMEY OR SOMEBODY TRYING TO DISTANCE\nYOURSELVES FROM DONALD TRUMP, NOW YOU'RE DEALING WITH BOTH\nTRYING TO APPEAL TO THOSE PEOPLE THAT YOU WERE REACHING OUT TO\nSAYING, I CAN'T ENDORSE DONALD TRUMP BUT ALSO TO HIS BASE WHO\nARE EVEN MORE FIRED UP AND MAY PUNISH YOU AT THE POLLS.\n>> KERRY, PEOPLE ARE SAYING DONALD TRUMP HAD A GREAT\nPERFORMANCE. HE DIDN'T STUDY.\nHE CAME OUT ARMED WITH INFORMATION THAT HAD BEEN ON\nEVERY BREITBART SITE OR FAR RIGHT ABOUT CLINTON AND THESE\nALLEGATIONS. HE DID HIS HOMEWORK AGAINST BILL\nCLINTON. >> THIS WAS AN EXPECTATION AS\nWELL. >> HE STUDIED UP, PREPARED FOR\nONE BATTLE. >> AND HE WAS MORE AGGRESSIVE.\nHE TOOK MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO GO AFTER, FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE FIRST\nDEBATE, HE DIDN'T BRING UP BENGHAZI, TO TALK MORE ABOUT THE\nE-MAILS. >> HE DIDN'T TRAIN IN THE FIRST\nDEBATE. >> HE WENT BACK AND HAD AT LEAST\nA MORE SORT OF COHERENT AND FOCUSED ARGUMENTS AT SOME POINT\nWHICH IS WHY REPUBLICANS SAID, THIS IS A BETTER PERFORMANCE FOR\nHIM AND GALVANIZED THE PEOPLE WHO THINK HILLARY CLINTON IS\nCOMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. >> I THINK IT'S AN INCREDIBLE\nDAY-AFTER ANALYSIS AND WHEN YOU PUT IN THE SPEAKER RYAN COMMENT,\nTO KELLY O.'S POINT, NOT NEW BUT 29 DAYS OUT, DID WE THINK HE'D\nBE SAYING THEM AGAIN? >> IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT.\n>> IT IS.",

WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THAT SORT\nOF -- THE PHYSICALITY, AS IT WERE, OF THE EVENING.\n>> IT SEEMED COMPLETELY INTENTIONAL THAT TRUMP WAS\nCROWDING HER SPACE ON PURPOSE TO, I MEAN, A NUMBER OF THINGS\nCOULD BE POTENTIALLY, RIGHT. HE COULD BE TRYING TO RATTLE\nHER. HE COULD BE TRYING TO GET HER TO\nLOOK OVER HER SHOULDER NERVOUSLY.\nHAVE HER, YOU KNOW, THROW HER OFF HER GAME AND MAKE A MISTAKE.\nOR HE COULD SIMPLY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO OWN THE STAGE.\nROAM AROUND AND KEEP THE CAMERA AND ATTENTION ON HIM.\nI MEAN, IT WORKED, SORT OF.

HE SAYS MR. TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN HAS\nALWAYS BEEN POWERED BY A GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT, NOT BY\nWASHINGTON, FOR THE AUDIENCE  BASICALLY SAYING THERE IS NO\nUPDATE TO HIS POSITION. HE IS NOT UNENDORSING DONALD\nTRUMP. BUT HE IS CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO\nCAMPAIGN WITH HIM, AND BASICALLY IS SAYING TO ALL REPUBLICANS,\nVULNERABLE REPUBLICANS, THOSE IN COMPETITIVE RACES RIGHT NOW, DO\nWHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO TO GET REELECTED, OUR CONCERN IS THE\nHOUSE MAJORITY. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE SORT OF\nADVICE THAT SO MANY REPUBLICANS ARE NOW FACING AS IT RELATES TO\nDONALD TRUMP? >> IT IS A DIFFICULT DANCE THAT\nPEOPLE LIKE PAUL RYAN ARE HAVING TO MAKE AND PART OF IT IS BEING\nSELF- INFLICTED. PAUL RYAN TO COME OUT AND SAY\nESSENTIALLY TO HIS MEMBERS, YOU KNOW, DO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IN\nYOUR RACE, BUT THAT ALSO KIND OF UNDERSCORES THE REALITY FOR SOME\nOFFICIALS THEY NEED TO RUN AWAY FROM THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE IF THEY ARE GOING TO REMAIN VIABLE,\nWHILE OTHERS IS TO CLING TO THE NOMINEE, THAT MAYBE TRUMP COULD\nHELP RISE THEM. THIS IS A PUBLIC SPILLOVER,\nOBVIOUSLY BEEN A PRIVATE STRUGGLE FOR A LOT OF\nREPUBLICANS, AND THROUGHOUT THE CAUCUS ON THE HILL AS WELL,\nBROADLY ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHAT, TO DO WITH THE CANDIDATE WHO\nDOES NOT TOTE THE LINE OF CONSERVATIVE POSITIONS.\n>> BEYOND, THE LANGUAGE THAT BROUGHT MORE THAN 50 REPUBLICANS\nFORWARD, EITHER CONDEMNING, DENOUNCING, SOME SAYING I'M\nGOING TO VOTE FOR MIKE PENCE INSTEAD AND ASKING FOR DONALD\nTRUMP TO DROP OUT.

IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE ENOUGH FOR\nDONALD TRUMP. THE NEW POLL HAS HIM HOVERING AT\n35%. >> DOUBLE DIGIT LEADS FOR\nCLINTON, EVEN IN A FOUR-WAY RACE DOES NOT -- THAT DOES NOT BODE\nWELL FOR REPUBLICANS. MANY ARE CLEARLY MORE THAN\nNERVOUS. THEY ARE STARTING TO PANIC.\nTHEY DON'T KNOW WHETHER JUMPING SHIP OR STAYING AND BALING IS\nBETTER.

I'M HALLIE JACKSON, LIVE ON THE\nCAMPUS FROM WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY, THE MIDDLE OF WHAT\nHIGH LEVEL GOP OPERATIVE CALLING THE SELF-IMPLOSION OF THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY. MOMENTS AGO, TRUMP'S PARTY\nRESPONDING TO THE NEWS THAT PAUL RYAN WILL NOT CAMPAIGN WITH\nTRUMP, WITH A TWEET FROM THE SENIOR COMMUNICATIONS ADVISOR,\nNOTHING HAS CHANGED, SAYS JASON MILLER.\nMR. TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN HAS ALWAYS BEEN POWERED BY A GRASSROOTS\nMOVEMENT, NOT WASHINGTON. ALL OF THIS, BY THE WAY, AS A\nBRAND NEW POLL RELEASED IN THE LAST HOUR FROM NBC NEWS AND\n\"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" SHOWS THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS LEADING\nDONALD TRUMP BY 11 POINTS IN THE FOUR-WAY RACE, CONDUCTED AFTER\nTHE RELEASE OF THE AUDIO, BUT BEFORE THE DEBATE.\nI WANT TO JUMP INTO REPORTERS FOLLOWING THE CAMPAIGNS IN THE\nBATTLEGROUND STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA AND PENNSYLVANIA.\nLET'S GET TO KELLY O'DONNELL IN CHARLOTTE, WHERE MIKE PENCE IS\nSCHEDULED TO SPEAK ANY MOMENT NOW.\nI HAVE TO GET YOUR REACTION AFTER PAUL RYAN SAID HE WILL NOT\nDEFEND OR CAMPAIGN WITH DONALD TRUMP FOR THE REST OF THE MONTH,\nFOR OF THE REST OF THE CYCLE. IT IS KIND OF WHAT HAE BEEN\nDOING SO FAR, THOUGH, RIGHT? >> Reporter: IT IS, IT IS A\nCONTINUATION OF A STRATEGY PAUL RYAN HAS HAD, AND IT HAS\nREQUIRED RE-VISITING IT WITH SOME OF THE DISCLOSURES THAT\nHAVE PUT THE TRUMP/PENCE TICKET FROM SUCH PERIL.\nWE KNOW THIS IS ONE OF THE WAYS MIKE PENCE WILL TRY TO SHOW THAT\nTHERE IS SOME STABILITY RETURNING TO THE SHIP BY BEING\nHERE IN NORTH CAROLINA, BATTLEGROUND STATE, BY ATTENDING\nWHAT WE ARE TOLD WILL BE A TOWN HALL MEETING.\nBUT PAUL RYAN'S RESPONSIBILITY IS DIFFERENT.\nHE IS TRYING TO REASSURE DONORS, THOSE ON THE BALLOT, THOSE\nRETURNING MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, AS WELL AS THOSE CHALLENGING\nDEMOCRATS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS RYAN SAYING\nHE WILL NOT WITHDRAW HIS ENDORSEMENT, BUT HE WILL NOT\nDEFEND TRUMP. HE IS REALLY SORT OF STEPPING\nINTO A SEPARATE LANE, TRYING TO PRESERVE THE HOUSE MAJORITY, AND\nTO WHATEVER EXTENT HE CAN HELP MITCH McCONNELL TRY TO PRESERVE\nTHE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IN THE SENATE.\nSO THEY HAVE DIFFERENT MISSIONS AT THIS POINT.\nIT IS WELL-KNOWN THAT PAUL RYAN HAS BEEN UNCOMFORTABLE WITH MANY\nTHINGS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, BUT HE IS A CLOSE FRIEND OF GOVERNOR\nMIKE PENCE. SO IT IS AN AWKWARD, DIFFICULT,\nCHALLENGING POSITION, AND THEY ARE TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO\nTHREAD THE NEEDLES IN A VERY COMPLICATED SET OF FACTS, AND SO\nLITTLE TIME LEFT TO DEAL WITH. HALLIE.\n>> I KNOW YOU'LL STICK AROUND.  WE'LL BRING YOU ANY NEWS LIFE AS\nIT HAPPENS. I WANT TO BRING IN PETER KING,\nREPRESENTATIVE FROM NEW YORK, WHO JOINS US ON THE PHONE.\nCONGRESSMAN, THANKS FOR BEING WITH US.\n>> GOOD TO WITH YOU. >> TALK US THROUGH THIS CALL\nWITH PAUL RYAN. WHAT DID HE SAY?\nWHAT WAS THE RESPONSE FROM RANK AND FILE REPUBLICANS LISTENING\nIN AND COMMENTING? >> I CAN'T GO INTO ALL THE\nDETAILS. IT WAS A PRIVILEGED CALL.\nHAVING SAID THAT PAUL DID SAY UP FRONT THAT HE WOULD BE FOCUSING\nON REELECTING HOUSE REPUBLICANS, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, HIS MAIN\nJOB WAS TO MAKE SURE WE RETAIN THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY.\nOBVIOUSLY HE CANNOT BE DEFENDING WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAID.\nWHEN THERE WAS A LITTLE PUSH BACK ON THAT PAUL CLARIFIED, AND\nSAID HE IS NOT WITHDRAWING HIS ENDORSEMENT, BUT JUST FEELS THAT\nIN VIEW OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER THE LAST FOUR WEEKS OF THE\nCAMPAIGN, HE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON REELECTING REPUBLICANS.\n>> YOU DESCRIBE THAT PUSH BACK, CONGRESSMAN.\nARE YOU ANGRY AT WHAT SPEAKER RYAN SAID, AND DO YOU THINK\nTHERE IS ANGER WITHIN THE PARTY? >> NO, WHEN I SAID PUSH BACK,\nPEOPLE WHO THOUGHT HE WAS NO LONGER ENDORSING DONALD TRUMP.\nHE SAID NO, I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR, I AM NOT IN ANY WAY\nWITHDRAWING MY ENDORSEMENT. NO, I'M NOT ANGRY AT PAUL RYAN\nAT ALL. HE HAS A DIFFERENT FUNCTION.\nHE HAS TO WORRY ABOUT 247 HOUSES REPUBLICANS, THE BIG PICTURE TO\nLOOK AT, AND AGAIN, HE HAS A WHOLE DIFFERENT VARIETY OF\nREPUBLICANS, OF COURSE THE IDEOLOGICAL SPECTRUM.\nI HAVE THE GREATEST RESPECT FOR PAUL RYAN.\n>> YOU KNOW, I WOULD WONDER, THOUGH, CONGRESSMAN, ISN'T IT TO\nA DEGREE YOUR JOB AS WELL AS THE JOB OF ALL HOUSE REPUBLICANS TO\nKEEP THE HOUSE MAJORITY? DO YOU FEAR WITH THE NUMBERS,\nTHE POLL NUMBERS WE'RE SEEING FROM DONALD TRUMP, THE ACTIONS\nIN THE LAST 72 HOURS COULD ESSENTIALLY DISINTGRATE THAT\nNUMBER? >> IT IS A PRO TRUMP BASE IN\nALMOST EVERY DISTRICT IN THE COUNTRY, POLITICAL TERMS, YOU'RE\nAT RISK OF ALIENATING THEM. DO WHAT YOU THINK IS RIGHT.\nTO ME, AS A REPUBLICAN AND AN AMERICAN, EVEN THOUGH I HAVE A\nPERSONAL FRIENDSHIP WITH HILLARY CLINTON, I BELIEVE DONALD TRUMP\nIS MUCH BETTER SUITED TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES\nAND COMMANDER IN CHIEF. WE SHOULD BE PUTTING THE\nINTERESTS OF THE COUNTRY FIRST, AND I THINK IN THE END, THE\nVOTERS END UP RESPECTING THAT, RATHER THAN TRYING TO, YOU KNOW,\nMANEUVER -- >> HOW DO YOU THINK THIS MOVE --\n>> LATEST POLL SHOWS. >> I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU\nTHERE. HOW DO YOU THINK THIS WILL\nAFFECT THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE? WHAT'S YOUR TAKE?\n>> I DON'T KNOW. LISTEN, PAUL RYAN AND REINCE\nPRIEBUS CLOSE PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP.\nTHEY BOTH KNOW EACH OTHER. PAUL RYAN IS DOING WHAT HE\nBELIEVES HE HAS TO DO, AS SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE.\nI HAVE FULL RESPECT FOR THAT. I'M ONLY SAYING WHAT I'M DOING,\nRUNNING AS A CONGRESSMAN IN THE SECOND DISTRICT IN NEW YORK.\nPEOPLE LOOK AT IT, YOU KNOW, FROM DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES, BUT\nI'M NOT IN ANY WAY QUESTIONING WHAT PAUL RYAN HAS SAID OR DONE.\nHE HAS BEEN AN OUTSTANDING SPEAKER.\n>> I HAVE ONE HIGH LEVEL REPUBLICAN OPERATIVE SAY THIS IS\nTHE SELF-IMPLOSION OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\nDO YOU AGREE? >> I THINK WE HAVE TO WATCH WE\nDON'T PANIC WHEN ONE BAD NEWS STORY COMES OUT.\nWHATEVER FLAWS DONALD TRUMP HAS COME, WE HAVE EQUALLY FLAWED\nCANDIDATES. THE SUPREME COURT NOMINATIONS,\nSUPPORT FOR THE POLICE, REBUILDING THE MILITARY, TO ME,\nDONALD TRUMP IS CLEARLY SUPERIOR.\nTHOSE ARE VALUES THAT MEAN A LOT TO REPUBLICANS.\nWE CAN'T ALLOW PANIC TO SET IN, AND YOU KNOW, BACK IN 1998, THE\nDEMOCRATS DIDN'T RUN AWAY FROM BILL CLINTON WHEN HE WAS GUILTY\nOF FAR MORE SERIOUS OFFENSES, AND THE DEMOCYEAR.\n>> BRIEFLY, WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE NOW TO THOSE FELLOW MEMBERS OF\nCONGRESS OF YOURS, REPUBLICANS, WHO ARE ON THAT CALL WITH HOUSE\nSPEAKER WHO WERE UP SET AT WHAT HE HAD TO SAY?\n>> I DON'T THINK ANYONE WAS UP SET.\nREALLY, THEY WANTED A CLARIFICATION.\nWE CAME AWAY PRETTY UNITED AND I WOULD JUST SAY --\n>> UNITED WHEN YOUR HOUSE SPEAKER ISN'T --\n>> -- DON'T BE GIVING INTO PANIC.\nYOU HAVE TO WITHDRAW YOUR ENDORSEMENT, THAT'S ONE THING.\nIF YOU'RE DOING IT BECAUSE OF THE POLLS, THAT CAN END UPCOMING\nBACK TO BITE YOU. >> I GUESS I JUST WONDER, HOW\nYOU TALK ABOUT UNITY, WHEN THE HOUSE SPEAKER ISN'T GOING TO\nCAMPAIGN WITH OR DEFEND THE PARTY'S NOMINEE.\nHOW IS THAT UNITY? >> WELL, HE IS STILL ENDORSING\nHIM. AGAIN, THIS IS A VERY UNUSUAL\nYEAR. AND I THINK PAUL RYAN IS TRYING\nTO MAKE THE BEST OF A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION THAT HE IS\nIN. NOT OF HIS OWN MAKING.\nTHIS IS THE CARDS HE'S BEEN DEALT AND I GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR\nIT. >> CONGRESSMAN PETER KING,\nTHANKS FOR HOPPING ON THE PHONE.",

WE ARE NOW IN THE WORST CASE\nSCENARIO AS REPUBLICANS, WHERE DONALD TRUMP STOPPED THE\nBLEEDING LAST NIGHT, BUT TOO MUCH BLOOD HAD BEEN LOST.\nSO THAT RACE IS OVER, BUT NOT OVER ENOUGH TO CUT HIM LOSE.\nAT THIS POINT, IT IS TIME TO CONCENTRATE ON THE DOWN BALLOT\nRACE, SAVE THE HOUSE. DONALD TRUMP DOWN BY 14 POINTS,\nTHAT WILL BE VERY TOUGH TO OVERCOME FOR THE DOWN BALLOT\nRACES. THEY'VE GOT TO REALLY PUT IN THE\nEXTRA HOURS RIGHT NOW. >> 14 POINTS, IN A 4 WAY RACE WE\nSHOULD NOTE. I HAVE TALKED TO REPUBLICANS,\nPAUL RYAN SHOULD TAKE A STAND HERE AND WITHDRAW HIS\nENDORSEMENT AND THAT WOULD SEND A MESSAGE THAT COULD PRESERVE\nTHE MAJORITIES. WHAT'S YOUR TAKE?\n>> WELL, I THINK WHAT'S IMPRESSIVE HERE, I THINK THE\nSMART THING FOR PAUL RYAN PERSONALLY TO DO POLITICALLY\nMAYBE TO DO THAT. BUT HE IS CLEARLY TAKING HIS\nROLE AS SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE VERY SERIOUSLY, AND HE IS TAKING\nHIS ROLE AS THE DE FACTO LEADER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY\nPOLITICALLY, I'M SURE, IT WOULD HELP PAUL RYAN TO DO THAT.\nBUT HURT SOME OF HIS DOWN BALLOT RACES AND COULD BE CATASTROPHIC\nTO SOME OF THESE HOUSE RACES. HE IS DOING WHAT HE THINKS IS IN\nTHE BEST INTEREST OF HIS CAUCUS, WHICH IS IMPRESSIVE, EVEN THOUGH\nI WISH HE WOULD DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT.\n>> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF DONALD TRUMP'S STRATEGY TO BRING IN AS\nWE SAW YESTERDAY IN THOSE SURPRISE APPEARANCES, SOME OF\nBILL CLINTON'S ACCUSERS FROM YEARS AGO.\nIS THAT THE RIGHT MOVE FOR HIM, WILL IT CHANGE REPUBLICAN MINDS?\n>> NO, IT WILL ABSOLUTELY CHANGE NOTHING.\nIT WAS A CRINGE WORTHY STUNT. I UNDERSTAND VERY MUCH THE\nHYPOCRISY ARGUMENT AND EVEN AGREE.\nBUT THE DEMOCRATS NOW ARE JUST SHOCKED AND SHOCKED BY DONALD\nTRUMP'S COMMENTS SHOULD REALLY LOOK AT THEIR OWN NOMINEE AND\nTHEIR NOMINEE'S ACTIONS THROUGH THE YEARS.\nHOWEVER, TWO WRONGS DON'T MAKE IT RIGHT.\nTHE REPUBLICAN PARTY SHOULD STAND FOR SOMETHING.\nWE WERE VERY STRONG AGAINST WHAT BILL CLINTON DID IN THE '90s AND\nWHAT HILLARY CLINTON HAD DONE PROTECTING HIM AND ATTACKING\nSOME OF THESE WOMEN. IT IS UNACCEPTABLE.\nIT IS INEXCUSABLE. I WANT TO PLAY YOU A SOUND BITE\nOF MIKE PENCE RESPONDING TO THE TRUMP COMMENTS ON THE 2005 AUDIO\nTAPE AND TALK ABOUT IT. >> AS I SAID LAST WEEKEND, I\nDON'T CONDONE WHAT WAS SAID. I SPOKE OUT AGAINST IT.\nBUT THE OTHER PART OF MY FAITH IS I BELIEVE IN GRACE.\nI'VE RECEIVED IT. I BELIEVE IN IT.\nI BELIEVE IN FORGIVENESS. WE'RE CALLED TO FORGIVE AS WE\nHAVE BEEN FORGIVEN. LAST NIGHT, MY RUNNING MATE\nSHOWED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHAT IS IN HIS HEART.\nHE SHOWED HUMILITY TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\n>> YOU WATCHED THE SAME DEBATE. DID DONALD TRUMP SHOW ENOUGH\nCONTRITION TO CHANGE MINDS? >> I DON'T THINK ANYONE WAS\nCHANGING THEIR VOTE BASED ON THE FIRST 20 MINUTES OF THAT DEBATE.\nIT WAS A DISASTER. I DO THINK DONALD TRUMP HELD IT\nTOGETHER AND CLEARLY HAD PREPARED FOR THAT NEXT HOUR OF\nTHE DEBATE, AND HE PROBABLY WON IT.\nBUT THAT FIRST 20 MINUTES WAS NOT CONTRITION THAT I SAW.\nI THINK WHAT YOU ACTUALLY SEE THERE IS WHY SO MANY\nREPUBLICANS, CAME OUT AND SAID THAT'S GREAT.\nMIKE PENCE SHOULD BE AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET.\nLET'S VOTE ON THAT GUY. A LOT OF REPUBLICANS COULD GET\nBEHIND THAT. AND GIVEN THE ALTERNATIVE IS\nHILLARY CLINTON, A LOT OF DEMOCRATS COULD GET BEHIND IT\nTOO. WE HAVE THE TWO MOST UNPOPULAR\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES.

WHAT IS THE TAKE AWAY, WHAT IS\nTHE MOST IMPORTANT MOMENT THAT HAS HAPPENED TODAY IN YOUR VIEW?\nWHAT IS THE THING THAT WILL DRIVE THE COVERAGE FOR THE NEXT\n24 HOURS. >> I THINK IT IS A COMBINATION\nOF DONALD TRUMP GOING AFTER PAUL RYAN, AND PAUL RYAN SAYING THAT\nHE WON'T DEFEND DONALD TRUMP ANY MORE.\nJUST BECAUSE OF WHAT THAT SAYS ABOUT THE VICE REPUBLICAN DOWN\nBALLOT CANDIDATES SAY. YOU CAN'T ALIENATE, BUT SIDING\nWITH EITHER GROUP ALIENATES THE OTHER.\nIT PINS THEM INTO THIS UNCOMFORTABLE SITUATION.\n>> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE NEW POLLING NUMBERS?\nWE LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH THE CONGRESSIONAL SPLIT\nWHEN IT COMES TO OUR NBC/\"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" POLL.\nIT IS SIGNIFICANT.

VOTERS HEADING INTO THE BOOTH,\nIT GIVES THEM A REASON, AND THEY'LL VOTE FOR THE DEMOCRATIC.\nTHAT ISN'T QUITE WHERE IT IS BEFORE WAVE ELECTIONS THAT\nDEMOCRATS HAVE HAD IN THE PAST. 2006, IT WAS AROUND 15 POINTS,\nBUT STILL, A MUCH BIGGER GAP HAS TO BE WORRYING FOR REPUBLICANS.\n>> I SPOKE WITH ONE OPERATIVE, HEY, LISTEN, THE POLL WAS IN THE\nFIELD OVER A WEEKEND, WANTS TO SEE MORE NUMBERS, BUT THE THING\nTHIS PERSON IS LOOKING FOR IS INTENSITY AND ENERGY, ANY\nPOTENTIAL SWINGS IN THE DAYS TO COME.\nIS THAT WHAT YOU WOULD BE LOOKING TO AS WELL, AND HOW DOES\nTHAT PLAY INTO THIS? >> THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING,\nWHETHER DEMOCRATS GET MORE ENERGIZED.\nTHERE HAS BEEN A BIT OF AN ENTHUSIASM PROBLEM FOR HILLARY,\nSHE DOESN'T FIRE UP YOUNG VOTERS THE WAY BARACK OBAMA DID.\nIF THIS TAPE IS ABLE TO GET THEM OUT TO GO AND VOTE AGAINST TRUMP\nIN A WAY THEY WEREN'T BEFORE, THAT'S TRUE.\nAND NEEDING MORE DATE THAT, THAT'S WHAT REPUBLICANS ARE\nWORRIED ABOUT. THEY WANT MORE DATA.\nTHEY DON'T WANT THE PARTY AND THEIR CANDIDATES TO FREAK OUT\nJUST YET. THEY'RE REALLY PREACHING A\nLITTLE BIT OF PATIENCE TODAY. >> SO IN YOUR REPORTING, DO YOU\nTHINK IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS, WE COULD SEE MORE REPUBLICAN\nELECTED OFFICIALS WITHDRAWING THEIR SUPPORT, OR THAT MINI\nAVALANCHE HAS BEEN PUT ON HOLD FOR NOW?\n>> WELL, IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY. IF THE NUMBERS ARE REALLY BAD,\nPERHAPS WE WILL. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IF YOU DO\nIT NOW, AFTER ALL THESE POLLS HAVE COME OUT, IT REALLY DOES\nLOOK MORE OF A POLITICAL DECISION, WHEREAS SOME OF THE\nPEOPLE WHO DID IT OVER THE WEEKEND, PEOPLE LIKE KELLY\nAYOTTE, YOU COULD TELL THEY WERE MAKING A GUT DECISION.\nTHERE WASN'T POLLING DATA TO BACK IT UP.\nIF YOU PULL OUT NOW, AFTER PROBABLY RELEASING A STATEMENT\nSAYING YOU WERE SUPPORTING TRUMP, IT JUST REALLY LOOKS\nPRETTY POLITICAL AND NOT MOTIVATED BY THE RIGHT REASONS.\n>> POLITICO'S KEVIN ROBLAD,",

HALIE, LET ME START WITH YOU\nBECAUSE WE GOT THIS NEW TWEET CAME IN AT YOUR HOUR.\nSO PAUL RYAN IS ESSENTIALLY TELLING HOUSE MEMBERS THEY NEED\nTO DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM THE GOP AND DOING SO IS OKAY.\nHOW IS THE TRUMP TEAM REACTING TO WHAT'S PERCEIVING TO THIS GOP\nCIVIL WAR IN OCTOBER. >> HOW IS THE CAMPAIGN REACTING?\nWHAT I HAVE HEARD AND SEEN, FOR EXAMPLE, AIDS TO DONALD TRUMP\nONLINE IS THIS IDEA THAT HEY, IT IS THE GRASS ROOTS VERSES\nWASHINGTON JUST LIKE IT IS BEEN FOR THE PAST 16 MONTHS OR SO AND\nTHIS JUST CONTINUES TO PLAY INTO THAT.\nI WOULD NOTE THIS. THERE IS SOME SENSE THAT PAUL\nRYAN IS NOT DOING ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY THAN HE'S DONE OTHER\nTHAN BEING MORE EXPLICIT THAT HE WON'T CAMPAIGN OR DEFEND DONALD\nTRUMP. THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR\nTHIS LAST STRETCH OF TIME ANYWAY.\nTHIRD, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS CALL WITH PAUL RYAN. I HAD A CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT IT.\nI WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO A PORTION OF THAT.\n>> HOW YOU TALK ABOUT UNITY WHEN THE HOUSE SPEAKER IS NOT\nDEFENDING. HOW IS THAT UNITY?\n>> AGAIN, THIS IS AN UNUSUAL YEAR AND PAUL RYAN IS TRYING TO\nMAKE THE BEST OF A DIFFICULT SITUATION THAT HE'S IN.\n>> PERHAPS, THE AWARD FOR UNDER STATEMENT OF 2016 GOES TO\nCONGRESSMAN KING THERE, THOMAS WITH THE UNUSUAL YEAR LINE.\n>> YES, VERY UNUSUAL TO SAY THE LEAST.\nLETS GO TO KELLY O'DONELL. YOU ARE WITH MIKE PENCE IN NORTH\nCAROLINA AND HE JUST SAID THAT HE BELIEVES IN FORGIVENESS.\n>> Reporter: WELL, THERE IS A TOWN HALL MEETING GOING ON.\nI AM TRYING TO LISTEN TO THE QUESTION, VOTERS HAVE NOT ASKED\nABOUT THIS ISSUE. MIKE PENCE ADDRESSED IT RIGHT\nOFF THE TOP TALKING ABOUT HIS EXPECTATIONS ON DONALD TRUMP AND\nHE SAW HUMILITY IN HIS RUNNING MATE AND FOR HIM, IT WAS A\nSIGNIFICANT STEP. HE ALSO SAID HE DOES NOT CONDONE\nWHAT WAS SAID AND WE HEARD HERE OF A STRONG RESPONSE WHEN MIKE\nPENCE WERE IN NORTH CAROLINA, WHEN MIKE PENCE SAID HIS FAITH\nTELLS HIM TO ALSO BELIEVE IN GRACE AND FORGIVENESS.\nIT WAS A STRONG RESPONSE HERE ABOUT THAT ISSUE.\nSO HE'S TRYING TO SORT OF WRITE THE SHIFT AND GOING BACK TO SOME\nOF THE CORE ISSUES. ONE THING I WOULD NOTICE IS\nWHILE WE GAVE A STRONG SUPPORTIVE SERIES OF COMMENTS\nABOUT DONALD TRUMP, HAVING BEEN WITH MIKE PENCE MANY TIMES, HE\nWOULD REFER TO DONALD TRUMP AS THIS GOOD MAN.\nHE DID NOT DO THAT TODAY. HE CALLS HIM A FIGHTER AND DOES\nNOT QUIT. BUT, IT WAS SOMETHING I OFTEN\nHEARD PENCE TALK ABOUT THAT HE DID NOT DO THAT TODAY BUT\nBELIEVES THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS MADE UP SOME ND\nVOTERS WILL MAKE THE JUDGMENT ON THAT.\nAND THERE IS BEEN A VERY STRONG RESPONSE BY THOSE WAITED IN LINE\nTO COME TO SEE HIM. MIKE PENCE SORT OF PETITION AT\nTHIS TICKET HAS ENLARGED. HE HAD A CHANCE TO HELP HIS\nRUNNING MATE IN WAY WHERE THE SECOND PERSON ON THE TICKET DOES\nNOT GET TO DO. HE CALLS IT A HIGH WIRE ACT OF\nPOLITICS. HE'S TRYING TO ADDRESS IT\nWITHOUT KIND OF GIVING BACK ANYTHING THAT MIGHT SUGGEST THAT\nIT IS OKAY WITH HIM BUT ALSO TRYING TO SAY THERE IS REASONS\nTO SAY REPUBLICANS COULD STICK WITH THIS TICKET.\nTHAT'S KIND OF THE SENSE WE ARE GETTING SO FAR.\n>> THOMAS, YEAH, HE'S DISPLAYING THE LOYALTY HERE THAT SOME\nPEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONSED WHETHER OR NOT HE WILL BELIEVING THE\nTICKET. KRISTEN, LET ME GO TO YOU\nBECAUSE THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS SEIZING PRETTY QUICKLY ON IN\nFIGHTING IN THE GOP. IS THERE CONCERN FROM INSIDE THE\nCLINTON CAMP WHY THEY HAVE THESE DIFFERENT HEADLINES.\nDID CLINTON FAIL TO DELIVER A KNOCK OUT PERFORMANCE ON THAT\nSTAGE LAST NIGHT >> I DON'T THINK THERE IS A\nCONCERN ABOUT THAT. I SPOKE TO A LONG TIME\nDEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, THE GOAL LAST NIGHT WAS FOR SECRETARY\nCLINTON TO ESSENTIALLY DO NO HARM TO TRY TO LOOK PRESIDENTIAL\nAND TO TRY TO STAY ABOVE THE FRAY AND THAT WAS REALLY HER\nGOAL AND A LOT OF DEMOCRATS AND CLINTON CAMPAIGN OFFICIALS FELT\nTHAT SHE ACHIEVED THAT. >> WHEN HE PRESSED HER SHE WAS\nAN ENABLER OF HER HUSBAND'S AND SHE QUOTED MICHELLE OBAMA \"WHEN\nTHEY GO LOW, WE GO HIGH.\" >> THIS INSIGHTING OF THE GOP,\nJUST LAST HOUR, THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN RELEASING NEW ADS WHICH\nARE TESTIMONIALS. WE DO HAVE ONE OF THOSE ADS.\nLETS TAKE A LOOK. >> WHEN I SEE HIM BULLYING\nPEOPLE AND TRYING TO DIVIDE US, THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF COUNTRY I\nWANT MY KIDS TO GROW UP IN, I AM PUTTING PARTY ASIDE AND VOTING\nFOR HILLARY CLINTON. I DON'T AGREE ON HILLARY ON\nEVERYTHING BUT I KNOW SHE HAS THE JUDGMENT AND EXPERIENCE AND\nSHE KNOWS TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER TO GET THINGS DONE.\n>> FOCUSING ON THE IN FIGHTING WITHIN THE GOP TRYING TO STAY\nABOVE THE FRAY AND TRYING TO LOOK PRESIDENTIAL REALLY AIMED\nAT TRYING TO WIN OVER SOME OF THOSE UNDECIDED VOTERS, THOMAS.\nRIGHT NOW, THAT'S THE GOAL BECAUSE SECRETARY CLINTON COMING\nOFF OF A STRONG FIRST DEBATE AS SHE HEADED INTO LAST NIGHT.\nSHE DID NOT FEEL AS THOUGH SHE NEEDED TO PULL A LOT OF PUNCHES.\nSHE FELT AS THOUGH SHE HAD TO HOLD GROUND.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN COUNTED OUT SO MANY TIMES BEFORE.\nTHEY STILL SEE THIS AS A COMPETITIVE RACE.\n>> WE EXPECT TO SEE HER FIRST POLLS DEBATE EVENT THERE.\nKASIE HUNT IS TRAVELING WITH THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN TODAY.\nKRISTEN MENTIONED THAT WE HAVE DONALD TRUMP APPEARING BEFORE\nWOMEN WHO CLAIMED TO BE VICTIMIZED BY BILL AND HILLARY\nCLINTON HOLDING THIS NEWS CONFERENCE WITH THEM ON FACEBOOK\nAND INVITING THEM INSIDE THE TOWN HALL.\n>> DONALD TRUMP HAD TO RESPOND WHEN HE WAS ASKED ABOUT THOSE\n2005 COMMENTS CAUGHT ON AN OPENED MIC.\n>> THIS WAS LOCKER ROOM TALK. I AM NOT PROUD OF IT, THIS IS\nLOCKER ROOM TALK, I HATE IT BUT IT IS LOCKER ROOM TALK AND IT IS\nONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT IT WAS LOCKER ROOM TALK\n>> EVERYONE CAN DRAW THEIR OWN CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THIS POINT\nABOUT WHETHER OR NOT OF THE MAN IN THIS VIDEO OR THE MAN ON\nSTAGE RESPECTS WOMEN. HE NEVER APOLOGIZES FOR ANYTHING\nTO ANYONE. >> CASEY, THE CAVEAT OF\nLOCKER-ROOM TALK IS HAVING AN IMPACT ON THE POLLING,\nNEGATIVELY ON TRUMP. >> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT, OUR\nWALL STREET JOURNAL POLLS SHOW DIFFICULT NUMBERS HERE FOR\nDONALD TRUMP. 41% TOLL US HIS WORDS WERE\nCOMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. WHILE 31% IT WAS INAPPROPRIATE\nBUT THAT'S JUST HOW MEN TALK, OF COURSE, THAT WAS DONALD TRUMP'S\nSTANCE ON THE DEBATE STAGE. 67% OF REPUBLICANS STILL SUPPORT\nHIM AS THE NOMINEE. 9% NO LONGER SUPPORT HIM AND 14%\nWANT HIM TO DROP OUT. SO THAT, OF COURSE, IS THE\nPROBLEM THAT REPUBLICANS ARE DEALING WITH PUBLICLY TODAY.\nEVEN THOUGH THERE IS SOMETHING OF A SENSE THAT TRUMP MANAGE TO\nSTOP THE BLEEDING A LITTLE BIT ON THIS ISSUE.\nYOU ARE STARTING TO SEE THIS EVER MORE PUBLIC AND THAT'S WHAT\nTHE CLINTON OFFICIALS ARE FOCUSING ON TODAY.\nWE HAVE THIS IN WHO IS TRAVELING ON THE PLANE WITH CLINTON AND\nSHE SPOKE WITH SOME OF THE REPORTERS ON THEIR WAY HERE.\nSHE SAYS THE REPUBLICANS HAVE A LOT OF SOUL SEARCHING TO DO IF\nHILLARY CLINTON WINS. SHE TALKS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW\nCLINTON APPROACHED THIS AND THIS IS OF COURSE WHAT HILLARY\nCLINTON'S ADVISER IS SAYING. HE FOLLOW LOAD THROUGH ON HIS\nTHREAD AND IT WAS DESIGNED TO INTIMIDATE HILLARY CLINTON.\nMARY SAID IT DID NOT INTIMIDATE OR RATTLE HER.\n>> SHE WENT INTO THIS OF THE GROUND SHE ALREADY HAD.\nTHAT'S THE STRATEGY THAT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS USED\nTHROUGHOUT THIS RACE. SOMETIMES IT BACKFIRED ON THEM\nAND MADE THEM SEEN COMPLACENT. THE SHIFT SEEMS TO BE SO\nDRAMATIC OF THE WAY PEOPLE ARE APPROACHING IT AND TALKING ABOUT\nIT. IT SEEMS DIFFICULT FOR DONALD\nTRUMP TO BE ABLE TO RECOVER FROM IT.\nWE SEE MIKE PENCE AND PAUL RYAN IS HANDLING IT.\n>> KASIE HUNT, THANKS SO MUCH. ALSO, KELLY O'DONELL, THANK YOU,\nTHANK YOU. >> KATIE IS JOINING ME NOW, AN\nNBC CONTRIBUTOR AND CAMPAIGN MANAGER FOR MITT ROMNEY.\n>> KATIE, LET ME ASK YOU TODAY FROM THE TWEET THAT WE GOT FROM\nDONALD TRUMP, IT SEEMS TO BE THIS BIG GOP DIVIDE.\nPAUL RYAN FEEL THAT IS THE PARTY HAS A LOT OF SOUL SEARCHING.\nYOU KNOW PAUL RYAN REALLY WELL AND YOU HELPED HIM IN THE 2012\nARE HIS ACTIONS ENOUGH AND DO YOU THINK HE SHOULD AVOID\nUNENDORSING TRUMP AT THIS POINT? >> I THINK PAUL IS A GOOD MAN\nAND HE'S CON ATLANTICED OVER THIS BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT\nTHIS WAS A CANDIDATE THAT WAS DOMINATED BY THE PEOPLE.\nHE FEELS AN OBLIGATION TO SUPPORT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE.\nBUT, AT SOME POINT, IT DOES GET TO BE KIND OF A ENOUGH IS\nENOUGH. AND, I THINK BASICALLY WHAT HE'S\nSAYING IS THIS IS A SITUATION NOW FOR THIS NOMINEE HAS A\nPOTENTIAL TO BE SUCH A HUGE DRAG ON THE TICKET THAT ALL OF YOU\nCOULD BE IN JEOPARDY SO IT IS KIND OF AN EVERY PERSON IS FOR\nTHEMSELVES AND EVERY MAN AND WOMAN IS FOR THEMSELVES.\nYOU DO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO BUT DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU NEED TO DO\nONE THING OR ANOTHER OF SUPPORT OF ME. I AM FREEING YOU.\n>> IF PAUL RYAN IS SAYING THAT HE WANTS TO ABIDE BY THE WILL OF\nTHE PEOPLE, DOES THAT MEAN THAT PAUL RYAN DOES NOT HAVE A\nTEMPERATURE CHECK ON WHO THE PEOPLE ARE THAT CAN PRY THE GOP\nBECAUSE NOW HE'S GOING TO SEND ALL THE PEOPLE HOME WITH THEIR\nDOWN BALLOT RACES, DO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO.\nDOES THAT SEND A SIGNAL OF MORE CHAOS OF WHAT THE GOP IS AFTER\nTHIS ELECTION? I THINK WHAT THEY ARE CONCERN\nABOUT IS HOLDING ONTO A MAJORITY SO THAT THERE IS SOME LEVEL OF\nCHECK AND BALANCE ON HILLARY CLINTON.\nI DON'T THINK THERE IS VERY MANY PEOPLE WHO KNOW ABOUT POLITICS\nAND ARE WATCHING OF THE DATA THAT'S ROLLING IN AND BELIEVE\nTHAT HILLARY CLINTON IS GOING TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT.\nTHAT'S THE BED THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAVE MADE ITSELF BY\nNOMINATING A WEAK CANDIDATE AS DONALD TRUMP.\nWHAT HE IS SAYING IS WE NEED TO DO WHAT WE CAN DO IN ORDER TO\nTRY TO HOLD ON OF THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY SO THAT THE CONGRESS IS\nTHE LAST STANCE AGAINST HILLARY  MIKE PENCE IS STANDING BY.\nI WANT TO PLAY A PORTION OF THE INTERVIEW THAT I HAVE WITH MY\nCOLLEAGUE, TAKE A LOOK. >> WHAT DO YOU SAY OF MY MOM OF\nA SUBURBAN REPUBLICAN WOMAN WHO CAN NO LONGER VOTE FOR HIM\nBECAUSE HE DOES NOT BELIEVE IN HER DAUGHTER.\n>> WHAT I WOULD TELL YOUR MOM OR ANYBODY ELSE IS THAT THERE ARE\nTWO HUMAN BEINGS RUNNING IN THIS ELECTION AND NOBODY'S PERFECT.\nI CAN THINK ONE PERSON IN HUMAN HISTORY BEYOND THAT AND NON OF\nUS ARE. AT THE END OF THE DAY, THIS IS\nAN ELECTION THAT IS A CHOICE BETWEEN NOT JUST PEOPLE BUT\nPOLICIES. SO, KATIE, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF\nTHAT RESPONSE, IS IT ENOUGH TO DEMONSTRATE THE LOYALTY THAT HE\nHAS OR BELIEVE IN TRUMP. >> THIS WAS NOT NEWS THAT DONALD\nTRUMP WAS A RACIST OR SEXIST AND ALL THE THINGS THAT'S BEEN SAID\nABOUT HIM. IT WAS A DIFFICULT FOR HIM, I AM\nSURE HE HAD TO LOOK AT HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER AND IT WAS A\nDIFFICULT TIME OVER THE WEEKEND. HE MADE THIS BET AND HE'S GOING\nTO HAVE TO RELY ON IT. I DO THINK HE WILL STICK WITH TRUMP THROUGH THE ELECTION.\n>> 29 DAYS TO GO, KATIE PACKER. GREAT TO HAVE YOU ON TODAY.\n>> THANK YOU. >> OUR MICROSOFT PULSE QUESTION.\n>> PAUL RYAN SAYS HE'S NOT GOING TO DEFEND TRUMP ON HIS CAMPAIGN.\nSO FAR, 96% OF YOU SAY YES AND 4% SAY NO.\nLET YOUR VOICE BE HEARD. NEXT, DONALD TRUMP CONFRONTING\nHILLARY CLINTON OF BILL CLINTON'S ASSAULTS.\nWE'LL ASK OUR WENDY DAVIS NEXT. >> BILL CLINTON WAS ABUSIVE TO\nWOMEN AND HILLARY CLINTON ATTACKED THEM VICIOUSLY.\n>> WHEN I HEAR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, I AM REMINDED OF WHAT MY\nFRIEND, MICHELLE OBAMA, ADVISED US ALL.\n\"WHEN THEY GO LOW, YOU GO HIGH.\"",

WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH PAUL RYAN\nSAYING HE'S NOT GOING TO GO OUT THERE TO DEFEND TRUMP.\nIT IS SOMETHING THAT QUITE FRANKLY THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS\nVERY HAPPY, OF THE FOCUS OF THE NEWS TODAY.\nI THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN VIEWS\nPOSITIVELY, THERE ARE POTENTIALLY SOME HURDLES FOR\nTHEM TO STILL TO COME AND DRIP FROM WIKI LEAKS FROM THESE\nE-MAILS AND THE SECOND ROUND OF JOHN PODESTO'S E-MAILS IS COMING\nOUT TODAY. >> AND SOME CONCERNS OVER DEBBIE\nWASSERMAN SHOLTS.

KELLY O'DONELL IS COVERING THAT\nSTORY FOR US, SHE'S SOUTH ON THE PENCE BUS RIGHT NOW AND THEY\nJUST LEFT CHARLOTTE. TALK TO ME O F THE BOMB SHELL\nTHIS MORNING. I AM SURE YOU ARE SPEAKING TO\nALL KINDS OF FOLKS, ANY REACTION FROM FOLKS ON THE HILL?\n>> Reporter: WELL, I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO A LOT OF REPUBLICANS\nAND THEY WOULD ENGAGE IT DIFFERENTLY THAN I THINK AS SOME\nOF THE PUBLIC IS VIEWING ARE. PAUL RYAN WAS RELUCTANT TO\nENDORSE DONALD TRUMP. HE WAS CUTTING A PATH TO SAY HE\nAND OTHERS IN THE HOUSE NEED TO DO THEIR FIRST JOB WHICH IS TRY\nTO PROTECT THEIR MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE AND TO THE EXTENT THEY CAN\nHELP SENATORS WHO ARE RUNNING TO KEEP THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY,\nTHAT'S THEIR FOCUS. NOW, OF COURSE, IN JUST ABOUT\nANY OTHER CAMPAIGN YEAR, THERE WOULD BE A FULL EMBRACE OF THE\nTOP OF THE TICKET. THERE WOULD BE A DESIRE TO SEE\nTHE CANDIDATE WITH VARIOUS CONGRESSIONAL GROUNDS IN THE\nCOUNTRY. PAUL RYAN IS NOT CHANGING HIS\nPOSITION BUT HE WORKS BY PHONE AND CONFERENCE CALL WHICH IS THE\nREGULAR METHOD THAT ALL REPUBLICANS USE TO TOUCH BASE\nWHEN THEY ARE NOT IN WASHINGTON TO TALK ABOUT CURRENT EVENTS\nTHAT ARE AFFECTING THE PARTY AND THE RACE.\nTHAT'S WHY THIS IS HAPPENING TODAY.\nOF COURSE, THERE WAS A NEED FOR THIS KIND OF CONFERENCE CALL\nAFTER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS THAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS\nENDURED. NOW, ONE OF THE BRIGHT RESPONSE\nFOR THIS REPUBLICAN HOUSE IS THE BUS BELONGING TO THE CANDIDATE\nWHICH WE ARE RIDING ALONG AND THAT'S MIKE PENCE.\nHE HAS BEEN A REPUBLICAN HOUSE MEMBER FOR A DOZEN YEARS.\nDONALD TRUMP DOES NOT. SO PART OF WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS\nWHEN THERE IS AN ABSENCE OF LONG TIME RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN A\nCANDIDATE AND OTHER OFFICER HOLDERS, WHEN THE GOING GETS\nTOUGH, THERE IS LESS LIKELIHOOD OF PEOPLE STANDING BY THAT\nCANDIDATE WHO'S IN TROUBLE. SOME OF THAT IS IN PLACE HERE.\nWHAT YOU HAVE IS A CASE OF REPUBLICANS VERY CONCERNED OF\nTHE DAMAGE DONE BY THE RECORDINGS AND HOW OFFICE\nHOLDERS AROUND THE COUNTRY HAVE RESPONDED AND MOST CONCERNED\nABOUT HOW ARE VOTERS TAKING THIS ALL IN.\nWILL THEY STICK WITH REPUBLICANS, WILL THEY LOSE THE\nSENATE OR EVEN THE HOUSE? SOME ARGUED THAT IT COULD BE IN\nPLAY NOW. THAT'S WHY WHAT IS HAPPENING\nTODAY, IT IS ABOUT FIRST THING FIRST IF YOU ARE SPEAKER OF THE\nHOUSE AND TRYING TO PROTECT THAT MAJORITY AND TRYING TO HELP YOUR\nCANDIDATES AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE SEEING PLAYING OUT TODAY AS\nWHERE HE ON THE BUS IN NORTH CAROLINA FOLLOWING MIKE PENCE\nWHO'S BEEN IN A HOT SEAT HIMSELF.\nHE'S DESCRIBING HIS NEW POSITION THAT HE'S IN IN A HIGH WIRE ACT\nWITHOUT A NET AS HE'S EXPLAINING DONALD TRUMP WITHOUT ANY\nCONDONING REMARKS OF THOSE CONTROVERSIAL DEFENSE.\n>> YOU ARE ON YOUR WAY WHERE NOW?\n>> WE ARE BETWEEN CHARLOTTE AND FLETCHER.\nWE GOT A COUPLE OF HOURS ON THE BUS HERE, I LOVE A GOOD BUS RIDE\nAND EVEN RIDING BACKWARD AND TALKING TO YOU LIVE.\nTHIS IS POLITICS IN THE LAST 30 DAYS\n>> KELLY O'DONELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nTHE WEATHER IS LOOKING NICE OUTSIDE AFTER THE HURRICANE.\nFOR MORE ON THE IMPACT OF CONGRESS OF THAT 2005 TRUMP TAPE\nTHAT CAME OUT THAT EVERYBODY IS TALK UGH ABOUT AND THE DEBATE\nLAST NIGHT. I WANT TO BRING IN JEREMY PETERS\nAND SHANE, GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.\n>> SURE >> AS OUR OWN KELLY O'DONELL\nWALKED US THROUGH. PAUL RYAN IS NOT GOING TO DEFEND\nHIM AND CAMPAIGNING FOR HIM, HOW BIG OF A DEAL IS THIS AND IS\nTHERE A CHANCE, THAT THE HOUSE GOES DEMOCRAT?\n>> WELL, THERE IS A GREATER CHANCE THAN THERE WAS ON FRIDAY\nMORNING. I THINK THAT YOU HAVE SEEN THAT\nTHAT PANIC IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THAT THEY COULD INDEED\nLOSE THE HOUSE AND REALLY INCREASE OVER THE LAST 48 HOURS\nOR SO. WHILE IT IS QUITE A LONG SHOT STILL, IT IS ONE THAT'S OPENLY\nDISCUSSED. PAUL RYAN WOULD NOT BE REACTING\nTHE WAY HE DID IF HE DID NOT HAVE A REAL FEAR, AT LEAST\nPOSSIBLE. LOOK AT HIS ACTION AND THEY\nSPEAK VOLUMES. >> 49% OF VOTERS WANT DEMOCRATS\nIN POWER. THOSE ARE ALL VOTERS THAT WERE\nASKING. WHAT ARE YOU HEARING, DO YOU\nTHINK REPUBLICANS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE LOST, IT IS THE SAME\nQUESTION THAT I ASKED JEREMY BUT WE ARE AT THAT POINT YET?\n>> THERE ARE A COUPLE KEY INDICATORS THAT BOTH ARE LOOKING\nFOR AND CLINTON IS HITTING THEM IN THE NEW NBC SURVEY.\n>> IF SHE'S AHEAD BY DOUBLE DIGIT NATIONALLY, THAT'S LIFTING\nALL KINDS OF RACES AND POTENTIALLY IN SCARY TERRITORY,\nWE'LL KNOW A LOT MORE AFTER THE NEXT 48 HOURS.\n>> REPUBLICANS ARE GOING IN THE FIELD.\nTHEY SAW THE DEBATE AND THEY SAW THE TAPE BREAK ON FRIDAY AND\nTHEY'LL GET OPINIONS FROM VOTERS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND\nTOMORROW, WEDNESDAY, THEY'LL HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT DOES THIS\nNEW LANDSCAPE LOOKS LIKE, WHEN YOU HEAR THINGS ABOUT PIE I\nDON'T KNOW AND YOU SEE THE COMMENTS OF THE WEEKEND DROVE\nTHE REPUBLICANS LEADING DONALD TRUMP, YOU KNOW THE LANDSCAPE\nHAS CHANGED. >> JASON MILLER, TRUMP'S ADVISER\nTWEETED ABOUT THIS. SAYING NOTHING HAS CHANGED, MR.\nTRUMP'S CAMPAIGN HAS ALWAYS BEEN POWERED BY A GRASS ROOT MOVEMENT\nAND NOT WASHINGTON. >> WE WATCHED THE TRUMP'S TWEET\nEARLIER. THANKS FOR NOTHING, THEY ARE THE\nOUTSIDE CANDIDATE. GIVEN EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED\nOVER THE PAST THREE DAYS SINCE FRIDAY OF THE TAPE.\nWHERE ARE WE AT? >> JASON MILLER IS ABSOLUTELY\nRIGHT. THE TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN IS NOT\nPOWERED BY WASHINGTON AND THROUGH THE EXTENT THAT THE\nNATIONAL COMMITTEE HAS NOT HELPED DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN.\nTHAT'S ILLEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT THAT THE RNC CANNOT\nTEAR UP. THEY ARE REALLY STUCK WITH HIM\nFCHLT YOU LOOK AT TRUMP'S PERFORMANCE IN THE DEBATE LAST\nNIGHT, HE'S NOT INTERESTED IN GOING DOWNEY SORT OF MIDDLE ROAD\nHERE. HIS JOB LAST NIGHT AS HE SAW IT\nWAS TO THROW OUT RED MEAT TO THE HARDEST HARD CORE TO HIS\nSUPPORTERS AND THAT'S WHAT HE DID.\nTALKING ABOUT SIDNEY BLUMENTHAL AND BENGHAZI AND THE PEOPLE HE\nNEED TO WIN THE ELECTION. THIS IS A HUNKER DOWN MOMENT.\n>> SHANE, DID YOU HEAR ANY CHANGING MOMENT LAST NIGHT?\n>> DONALD TRUMP IS APPEALING TO THE REPUBLICAN BASE AND PART OF\nTHE REPUBLICAN BASE THAT MADE HIM THE NOMINEE.\nTHIS IS THE CHALLENGE FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY LEADERSHIP.\nTHEIR VOTERS ARE STILL WITH DONALD TRUMP WHETHER THEY\nDENOUNCED HIM OR DISTANCED THEMSELVES FROM HIM, THIS IS\nWHAT YOU ARE HEARING AND WHAT YOU ARE SEEING IN THE POLLS.\nREPUBLICANS ARE STILL SUPPORTIVE OF DONALD TRUMP.\nTHE PROBLEM IS THERE NOT ENOUGH VOTERS TO WIN THIS FALL, NOT\nJUST AT THE PRESIDENTIAL LEVEL BUT IN SENATE RACES AND HOUSE\nRACES. THAT'S WHY THERE IS THIS\nWIDESPREAD PANIC GOING ON. >> I FEEL LIKE WE ARE IN A\nDIFFERENT PLACE. IT IS LANDOWNER 3:00.\nWE ARE IN A DIFFERENT PLACE THAN WE WERE ON SATURDAY.\nON SATURDAY, THERE WERE A CASCADE OF PEOPLE ABANDONING\nTRUMP OVER THE TAPE AND TODAY T IT IS CASCADE, ALL RIGHT, HE DID\nALREADY LAST NIGHT. >> HE EXCEEDED SMALL\nEXPECTATIONS FOR HIM TO PERFORM AT A COMPETENT LEVEL.\nYOU HAVE THAT AND COMBINED WITH THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE REALLY\nLOOKING FOR ANYTHING IN HIS PERFORMANCE TO REASSURE THEM AND\nANYTHING TO GIVE THEM A LITTLE BIT OF SATISFACTION SO THEY\nWOULD NOT BOLT. HE DID THAT.\nHE TURNED IN A PRETTY WELL, WELL MANNERED AND VERY EVEN HEALED\nFOR THE MOST PART PERFORMANCE. I THINK HE DID SEEM RATTLED AT A\nFEW OCCASIONS BUT HE DID NOT BLOW HIMSELF UP ON STAGE AND\nTHAT'S WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE EXPECTING HIM TO DO.\nI DON'T THINK HE REDEEMED HIMSELF BUT HE STOPPED THE\nBLEEDING TO A LARGE EXTENT. >> NEW YORK TIMES, JEREMY\nPETERS. THANK YOU GUYS FOR BEING HERE.\n>> THANK YOU. >> WE HAVE A REPORT ON THE\nDEBATE. DONALD TRUMP ONCE AGAIN SAID HE\nDOES NOT KNOW WHETHER RUSSIA IS TRYING TO HACK THE U.S.\nELECTION, TAKE A LISTEN. >> I DON'T KNOW PUTIN, I THINK\nIT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE GET ALONG RUSSIA BECAUSE WE CAN\nFIGHT ISIS TOGETHER. I NOTICE ANY TIME ANYTHING WRONG\nHAPPENS, THEY LIKE TO SAY THE RUSSIANS ARE DOING THE HACKING.\nOR MAYBE THERE IS NO HACKING. THEY ALWAYS BLAME RUSSIA.\nTHE REASON THEY BLAME RUSSIA BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY'RE\nTRYING TO TARNISH ME ON RUSSIA. >> HE'S BEEN BRIEFED WITH ALL OF\nTHIS. BOB, GOOD TO SEE YOU.\nSO HE HAS HAD BRIEFINGS. THESE ARE THINGS THAT EVERY\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WOULD GO THROUGH.\n>> WELL, IF YOU LOOK AT THE TIME LINE, KATE, HE WAS BRIEFED ON\nAUGUST 17TH. WE HAVE SEEN IT.\nOF COURSE, ON FRIDAY, WHERE THE OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR OF\nNATIONAL INTELLIGENCE THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY\nCOMES OUT SAY THEY HAVE HIGH CONFIDENCE OF RUSSIA AND HE GOES\nON WITH THE DEBATE AND SAYS HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT.\nIN ADDITION, TO HIS OWN BRIEFING WE ARE TOLD THAT THERE HAS BEEN\nADDITION NALL BRIEFING OF STAFF, AND THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN GETTING\nACCESS OF THE LATEST INTELLIGENCE, WHAT WE ARE SEEING\nNOW IN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY IS REAL ANGER.\nONE OFFICIAL TOLD US TODAY THAT WHAT WAS SAID LAST NIGHT BY\nTRUMP WAS QUOTE \"A WILLFUL MISREPUTATION.\"\n>> SO ANGER AT TRUMP FOR MISCHARACTERIZING THINGS.\n>> CORRECT. >> IT GOES BACK TO THE MANNER IN\nWHICH THE U.S. HAS BEEN PURSUING THIS.\nTHIS IS NOT JUST GUESS WORK. THIS IS A HIGH, HIGH PRIORITY.\nSO AS A RESULT OF THIS PRIORITY BY THE TIME HE GETS HIS FIRST\nBRIEFING, AGAIN, WE HAVE SEEN THESE MATERIALS, IT IS A FIGURE\nCOMPLETE AND IT WAS DEALT WITH IN TERMS OF THE FORENSICS,\nLOOKING FOR SIGNATURES AND THINGS LIKE ELECTRONIC EAVESDROPPING.\nIT WAS A HIGH CONFIDENCE THAT THEY HAD OVER THE PAST TWO OR\nTHREE OR FOUR MONTHS THAT IT IS THE RUSSIANS.\n>> HE'S MISCHARACTERIZING THE BRIEFING THAT HE'S GOTTEN.\n>> THAT'S WHAT U.S. INTELLIGENCE IS TELLING US.\n>> WE MENTIONED HILLARY CLINTON MAKING HER FIRST APPEARANCE FROM\nLAST NIGHT'S DEBATE. LETS LISTEN IN.\n>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, WOW. >> SOUNDS LIKE WE GOT SOME WAYNES' STATE WARRIORS HERE\nTODAY. I AM SO EXCITED AND SO THRILLED\nTO BE HERE. [ CHEERS ]\nDID ANYBODY SEE THAT DEBATE LAST NIGHT?\n[ APPLAUSE ] [ CHEERS ]\n>> WELL, YOU NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE THAT BEFORE.\nIT IS GREAT TO BE HERE WITH SO MANY WONDERFUL OFFICIALS, I WANT\nTO THANK THEM, I KNOW THEY HAVE BEEN OUT TO TALK WITH YOU, I\nAPPRECIATE THE INTRODUCTION THAT JIM ALLEN GAVE ME AND I AM PROUD\nTO BE INTRODUCED BY THE STEEL WORKERS.\nI WANT TO THANK YOUR SENATOR AND GARY PETERS.\nYOUR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, JOHN CONYERS AND SANDY LEVIN.\nI WANT TO THANK YOUR WONDERFUL MAYOR.\nI WANT TO THANK COUNTY EXECUTIVE WARREN EVANS.\nIT IS EXCITING TO BE HERE FOR SO MANY REASONS TO BE BACK HERE IN\nDETROIT AND TO BE IN WAYNE STATE.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA WAS PRETTY ACCURATE WHEN HE WAS TALKING\nABOUT HOW DETROIT IS COMING BACK.\n[ CHEERS ] THAT'S THANKS TO A LOT OF\nPEOPLE. AND IT IS GOING TO REALLY DEPEND\nON THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF THIS UNIVERSITY AND THIS CITY TO\nBUILD AL FUTURE THAT WE CAN ALL NOT ONLY BE PROUD OF BUT BE\nAPART OF. I WILL TELL YOU THIS, IF I AM SO\nFORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE YOUR PRESIDENT, COME NEXT JANUARY, I\nWILL BE YOUR PARTNER. [ CHEERS ]\n[ APPLAUSE ] WHETHER OR NOT I GET THAT CHANCE\nREALLY DEPENDS ON ALL OF YOU AND WE ARE COMING UP TO AN IMPORTANT\nDAY. TOMORROW, OCTOBER 11th, IT IS\nTHE LAST DAY TO REGISTER TO VOTE IN MICHIGAN.\nSO I AM HOPING THAT ALL OF YOU EITHER ARE REGISTERED OR YOU\nWILL BEFORE THE DEADLINE TOMORROW AND WE HAVE PEOPLE ALL\nOVER THE CROWD WITH CLIPBOARDS. WE GOT CLIPBOARDS WHO CAN HELP\nYOU REGISTER TO VOTE. IF YOU ARE REGISTERED AND YOU\nHAVE FRIENDS AND FAMILY WHO ARE NOT, I NEED YOU TO CONVINCE THEM\nTO REGISTER, GO TO THEIR LOCAL CLERK OFFICE.\nIF YOU ARE NOT SURE OR MOVED RECENTLY OR YOU WANT TO MAKE\nSURE, GO TO IWILLVOTE.COM. [ CHEERS ]\n>> IT IS AMAZING. YOU CAN PUT YOUR NAME IN AND\nADDRESS TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE REGISTERED.\nPLEASE DO THAT. IF YOU HAVE AN ABSENTEE BALLOT\nSITTING AT HOME, I HOPE YOU WILL FILL IT OUT AND MAIL IT IN RIGHT\nAWAY. DON'T PUT IT OFF.\nTHERE ARE A LOT OF IMPORTANT RACES DOWN BALLOT AS WELL.\nTHAT'S HOW WE ARE GOING TO WIN BY THE BIGGEST TURN OUT THAT WE\nHAVE SEEN IN A REALLY, REALLY LONG TIME.\n[ CHEERS ] [ APPLAUSE ]\nTHE REASON WHY IT IS GOING TO BE A BIG TURN OUT IS PEOPLE REALLY\nKNOW WHAT'S AT STAKE AT THIS ELECTION.\nTHEY ARE CONCERNED AS YOU HEARD JIM SAYS THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN\nME AND MY OPPONENT ARE PRETTY CLEAR.\n[ CROWD BOOING ] TO PARAPHRASE MY FRIEND,\nMICHELLE OBAMA, ONE OF US WENT HIGH AND ONE OF US WENT LOW.\n[ APPLAUSE ] [ CHEERS ]\nAND I WILL TELL YA, WHAT'S EXCITING TO ME IS THAT WE ARE\nGETTING MORE AND MORE SUPPORT AND NOT JUST FROM DEMOCRATS BUT\nFROM INDEPENDENCE AND REPUBLICANS.\n[ CHEERS ] >> NOW, I BELIEVE YOU DESERVE\nSOMETHING TO VOTE FOR AND NOT JUST SOMETHING TO VOTE AGAINST.\nSO, LAST NIGHT WHEN I GOT A CHANCE, I TRIED TO SPEAK\nDIRECTLY TO THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE ON PEOPLE'S MINDS AND TO\nSHARE MY VISION OF WHAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER.\n[ CROWD CHANTING, HILLARY, HILLARY, HILLARY ]\n>> NOW, I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, DONALD TRUMP SPENT HIS TIME\nATTACKING WHEN HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN APOLOGIZING.\n[ APPLAUSE ] [ CHEERS ]\n>> NOW, THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS HE SHOULD HAVE APOLOGIZE\nFOR, RIGHT? ON FRIDAY, THE WHOLE WORLD HEARD\nHIM TALKING ABOUT THE TERRIBLE WAY HE TREATS WOMEN.\nAND LAST NIGHT WHEN HE WAS PRESSED ABOUT HOW HE BEHAVES, HE\nJUST DOUBLE DOWN ON HIS EXCUSE THAT IT IS LOCKER ROOM BANTER.\nWOMEN AND MEN ACROSS AMERICA KNOW IT IS A REALLY BAD EXCUSE\nFOR BEHAVING BADLY AND MISTREATING PEOPLE.\nNOW, I GOT TO TELL YOU THOUGH, WE HAVE SEEN THIS KIND OF\nBEHAVIOR ALL THROUGH THE CAMPAIGN FROM MY OPPONENT.\nUNFORTUNATELY, SOME PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO FACE IT BUT HERE IS A\nMAN WHO HAS INSULTED, NOT JUST WOMEN BUT AFRICAN-AMERICANS,\nLATINOS, PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, MUSLIMS, POWS AND\nSO MANY MORE. [ CHEERS ]\nYOU KNOW -- I DO HOPE SOMEBODY FOLLOWS THAT GENTLEMAN AND\nSTAGES AN INTERVENTION, HE CLEARLY HAS NOT BEEN FOLLOWING\nTHIS ELECTION VERY CLOSELY. BUT, HEY, FOLKS, WE NOW KNOW WHO\nDONALD TRUMP IS BUT THE QUESTION IS",

DO THEY CONDEMN TRUMP TO KEEP\nSUPPORT FROM PEOPLE OFFENDED BY HIS INAPPROPRIATE REMARKS, OR\nSUPPORT TRUMP AFTER THE BASE APPLAUDED HIS PERFORMANCE LAST\nNIGHT. OF COURSE, THE EASIEST COURSE OF\nACTION WOULD BE TO STAY QUIET AND TRY TO RIDE OUT THE STORM.\nBUT MANY DON'T HAVE THAT LUXURY.

WE DON'T HAVE TO SUPPORT MIKE\nGALLAGHER EITHER. >> A LITTLE HAT TIP TO A SPANISH\nLANGUAGE AD, BUT THAT IS GOING TO BE HAPPENING ACROSS THE\nCOUNTRY FOR 29 DAYS, ISN'T IT? >> YEAH, IT IS.\nAND WHAT EVERY CANDIDATE IS GOING TO HAVE TO DO, SEE IT AS\nAN OPPORTUNITY TO DEFINE HIM OR HERSELF, AND THERE ARE GOING TO\nBE DIFFERENT REACTIONS FROM DIFFERENT CANDIDATES.\nSOME OF THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES BELIEVE IN THE\nPOPULIST CHANGE MESSAGE OF DONALD TRUMP.\nSOME ARE MORE TRADITIONAL. THE IMPORTANT THING FOR\nCANDIDATES IS TO BE TRUE TO THEMSELVES AND WHO THEY ARE AND\nTHAT GENUINENESS IS ULTIMATELY WHAT'S GOING TO COME OUT.\n>> AS PAUL RYAN SAID TODAY IN HIS CONVERSATION WITH HIS\nREPUBLICAN CONFERENCE, BASICALLY, YOU DO WHATEVER THE\nHECK YOU NEED TO WIN IN YOUR RACE.\nMY CONCERN IS THE HOUSE MAJORITY RIGHT NOW.\nTHIS FEUD BETWEEN TRUMP AND RYAN RIGHT NOW, WHY PICK ANOTHER FEUD\nWITH PAUL RYAN? >> WELL, I DON'T SEE AN\nADVANTAGE FOR HIM TO DO THAT.

TODAY WE GOT AN ANSWER.\nA NEW NBC NEWS/\"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" NATIONAL POLL SHOWS\nHILLARY CLINTON LEADING THE DIGITS BY DOUBLE DIGITS.\nCLINTON WAS UP BY JUST SIX POINTS IN THIS POLL JUST LAST\nMONTH. IN A TWO-WAY RACE, CLINTON'S\nLEAD EXTENDS TO 14 PERCENTAGE POINTS.\n52% TO 38%. ONCE AGAIN, A CNN/ORC POLL OF\nDEBATE WATCHERS NAMED CLINTON THE CLEAR VICTOR LAST NIGHT IN\nST. LOUIS. TRUMP TOOK HIS OWN TRUMPIAN\nVERSION OF A VICTORY LAP, CONTINUING HIS LINE OF ATTACK ON\nBILL CLINTON'S HISTORY WITH WOMEN AND HILLARY CLINTON'S\nALLEGED COMPLICITY IN IT. >> BILL CLINTON WAS THE WORST\nABUSER OF WOMEN EVER TO SIT IN THE OVAL OFFICE.\nHE WAS A PREDATOR. HILLARY CLINTON SYSTEMICALLY\nATTACKED AND DISCREDITED THE VICTIMS OF BILL CLINTON'S SEXUAL\nHARASSMENT AND ASSAULT. THESE THINGS AREN'T WRITTEN BY\nTHE MEDIA, BUT THEY'RE TRUE. WRITTEN BY MANY BOOKS.\nTHESE VICTIMS INCLUDE NAMES LIKE KATHLEEN WILLY, JUANITA\nBRODERICK, CONNIE HAMSLY, EILEEN WELLSTONE, SANDRA ALLEN JAMES,\nAND CHRISTIE ZIRTYA AND THERE ARE MANY, MANY MORE.\n>> Reporter: HERE IN NORTH CAROLINA, MIKE PENCE, AFTER A\nWEEKEND OF WAVERING, OR AT LEAST A WAIT-AND-SEE ATTITUDE, HE MADE\nAN AFFIRMATION OF SUPPORT FOR HIS RUNNING MATE THIS AFTERNOON\nAT AN EVENT IN CHARLOTTE. >> YOU KNOW, IT TAKES A BIG MAN\nTO KNOW WHEN HE'S WRONG AND TO ADMIT IT AND TO HAVE THE\nHUMILITY TO APOLOGIZE AND BE TRANSPARENT AND BE VULNERABLE\nWITH PEOPLE. AND DONALD TRUMP LAST NIGHT\nSHOWED HE'S A BIG MAN. AS I SAID LAST WEEKEND, I DON'T\nCONDONE WHAT WAS SAID AND I SPOKE OUT AGAINST IT.\nBUT THE OTHER PART OF MY FAITH IS I BELIEVE IN GRACE.\nI'VE RECEIVED IT. I BELIEVE IN IT.\nI BELIEVE IN FORGIVENESS. AND WE'RE CALLED TO FORGIVE AS\nWE HAVE BEEN FORGIVEN. AND LAST NIGHT MY RUNNING MATE\nSHOWED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHAT'S IN HIS HEART.\nHE SHOWED HUMILITY TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\n>> ALSO TODAY, HILLARY CLINTON SHARED HER ASSESSMENT OF DONALD\nTRUMP'S DEBATE PERFORMANCE WITH A CROWD OF SUPPORTERS IN\nDETROIT. >> LAST NIGHT, WHEN HE WAS\nPRESSED ABOUT HOW HE BEHAVES, HE JUST DOUBLED DOWN ON HIS EXCUSE\nTHAT IT'S JUST LOCKER ROOM BANTER.\nWELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, WOMEN AND MEN ACROSS AMERICA KNOW THAT\nIS JUST A REALLY WEAK EXCUSE FOR BEHAVING BADLY AND MISTREATING\nPEOPLE. >> ALL RIGHT.\nSO, MARK, HERE I AM IN PENNSYLVANIA WITH DONALD TRUMP.\nTHERE YOU ARE IN NORTH CAROLINA WITH MIKE PENCE.\nNOW THAT THE DEBATE IS A LITTLE LESS THAN 24 HOURS IN THE\nREARVIEW MIRROR, WHAT DO YOU THINK TRUMP ACCOMPLISHED WITH\nHIS PERFORMANCE LAST NIGHT, POLITICALLY?\n>> WELL, HE STOPPED THE TALK COMPLETELY FOR THE TIME BEING,\nAT LEAST. OF THE NOTION THAT HE SHOULD NO\nLONGER BE THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE.\nHE STOPPED AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL TODAY, ANY REPUBLICAN SAYING\nTHEY'D DISENDORSE HIM, AND THEY GAVE HIS OWN CAMPAIGN TEAM AND\nCORE SUPPORTERS SOME MEMBERS OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL\nCOMMITTEE A SHOT IN THE ARM, A FEELING LIKE THEY'RE BACK WITH\nSOME MOMENTUM AND WITH A CHANCE TO TRY TO GET BACK IN THIS RACE.\n>> RIGHT. I AGREE WITH ALL THAT.\nI MEAN, WATCHING TRUMP HERE JUST NOW, HE HAD A REAL SPRING IN HIS\nSTEP, AND IT WAS CLEARLY VERY BUOYANT AND FEELS HE'S ON A BIT\nOF A HIGH HERE. I'M NOT SURE HE DID ANYTHING TO\nHELP HIS CAUSE OF WINNING THE PRESIDENCY.\nAND WE'RE GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT WITH THIS\nPERFORMANCE. THE OTHER THING HE DID LAST\nNIGHT, IT'S CLEAR FROM THIS SPEECH THAT HE JUST GAVE AT THIS\nRALLY, WAS HE GAVE HIMSELF -- HE'S GONE NOW FULLY INTO THE\nMODE, AS WE HEARD IN THAT SOUND, WHERE BILL CLINTON'S PAST AND\nHILLARY CLINTON'S ROLE IN THAT PAST, WHEN IT COMES TO WOMEN, IS\nGOING TO BE A BIG PART OF THE CAMPAIGN GOING FORWARD, AT LEAST\nFOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. HE READ THAT STUFF OFF PROMPTER\nHERE TODAY. AND I IMAGINE WE'LL HEAR A LOT\nMORE ABOUT IT. HE WAITED UNTIL THE END OF THE\nSPEECH AND CAME IN WITH IT WITH RELISH.\nHE STARTED OUT SINGING THE PRAISES OF ROETHLISBERGER, SORT\nOF AN ODD THING TO DO WHEN YOU SPENT THE LAST THREE DAYS BEING\nACCUSED OF CONDONING AND IN FACT BRAGGING ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT,\nTO MENTION BEN ROETHLISBERGER IN A PRAISING WAY, A GUY WHO\nHIMSELF BEEN ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT TWICE.\nDONNY, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE DEBATE PERFORMANCE LAST\nNIGHT THAT TRUMP TURNED IN? >> I THINK THIS ELECTION, AS I\nSAID LAST WEEK, ENDED FRIDAY. I THINK WHAT TRUMP DID DO FOR\nHIMSELF IS POST-ELECTION, AFTER HE LOSES, HIS 25, HIS 30 MILLION\nFOLLOWERS FOR THE NEW NOW TRUMP REVOLUTIONARY NETWORK OR THE\nTRUMP REVOLUTIONARY PARTY WILL BE GINNED UP.\nHE DID NOT MOVE ONE VOTER INTO HIS COLUMN, NOT POSSIBLY, AND\nEVERYTHING THAT IS GOING TO BE HAPPENING IN THIS ELECTION, I\nWILL TALK ABOUT THIS A LOT IN THE NEXT SEGMENT, IS GOING TO BE\nLENS THROUGH GENDER AND PEOPLE ARE HEARING THAT TAPE IN THEIR\nHEADS, AND ALL HE DID WAS SOLIDIFY HIS POST-ELECTION\nBUSINESS MODEL, WHETHER IT BE A NETWORK OR A POLITICAL PARTY.\n>> YEAH, I MEAN, THERE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE -- DONALD TRUMP IS\nGOING TO NEED SOME LUCK AND A WIN IN THE THIRD DEBATE TO GET\nBACK WITHIN HAILING DISTANCE. WE'LL WAIT TO SEE MORE ON\nNATIONAL AND KEY STATE POLLING. BUT RIGHT NOW THAT NBC\nNEWS/\"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" POLL IS THE MARKER BY WHICH TRUMP HAS\nTO DEAL WITH THE REALITY HE FACES.\n>> THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM TODAY, AS WE SUGGESTED BEFORE,\nIS TRUMP'S PERFORMANCE LAST NIGHT JUST MAY BE HALTED MORE\nRUNAWAY REPUBLICANS FROM JILTING THEIR NOMINEE AT THE ALTAR.\nTHERE HAVE BEEN, AS WE SAID, NO NEW DEFECTIONS OF PEOPLE SAYING\nTRUMP SHOULD NO LONGER BE THE NOMINEE OR PEOPLE DISENDORSING\nTRUMP. BUT THERE WAS A KEY DEVELOPMENT\nTODAY, ALONG THESE LINES. SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE PAUL RYAN\nHELD A CONFERENCE CALL WITH CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS THIS\nMORNING. RYAN DIDN'T RESCIND HIS\nENDORSEMENT OF TRUMP, BUT HE DID MAKE IT CLEAR THAT HE WILL NO\nLONGER CAMPAIGN WITH OR DEFEND HIS PARTY'S STANDARD-BEARER,\nEMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING THE HOUSE IN REPUBLICAN\nCONTROL, RYAN URGED DOWN-BALLOT GOP CANDIDATES TO, QUOTE, DO\nWHAT'S BEST FOR YOU IN YOUR DISTRICT.\nTHAT CAUSED THE NOMINEE, DONALD TRUMP, TO FIRE OFF THIS TWEET.\nQUOTE, PAUL RYAN SHOULD SPEND MORE TIME ON BALANCING THE\nBUDGET, JOBS, AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND NOT WASTE HIS\nTIME ON FIGHTING REPUBLICAN NOMINEE.\nSO, JOHN, HOW DAMAGING DO TRUMP'S CHANCES, TO THE EXTENT\nYOU THINK HE HAS A CHANCE STILL, IS WHAT RYAN DID, AND THE THINGS\nWE DID OVER THE WEEKEND, OF PEOPLE DISENDORSING TRUMP AND\nSAYING THAT HE SHOULD STEP DOWN? >> LOOK, I THINK THAT ALL OF\nTHIS, THE SIGHT OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY FLEEING TRUMP\nOVER THE WEEKEND, NOW THE SIGHT, EVEN THOUGH HE DIDN'T DISENDORSE\nTRUMP, THE SIGHT OF PAUL RYAN TELLING -- BASICALLY TELLING HIS\nMEMBERS, IT'S EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF NOW, IS GOING TO SEND A\nBAD MESSAGE TO THE KIND OF VOTERS THAT TRUMP WOULD NEED IF\nHE WERE GOING TO BECOME COMPETITIVE IN THE RACE.\nAND LET'S BE CLEAR, ON THE BASIS OF THAT NBC NEWS/\"WALL STREET\nJOURNAL\" POLL, DONALD TRUMP IS NOT REMOTELY CLOSE TO\nCOMPETITIVE RIGHT NOW FOR THE PRESIDENCY.\nI'M NOT SAYING -- WE'VE GOT ANOTHER FOUR WEEKS, ANYTHING\nCOULD HAPPEN, I SUPPOSE. BUT RIGHT NOW, HE'S NOT EVEN\nCLOSE TO BEING COMPETITIVE. AND SO, I THINK THAT THE RYAN\nTHING COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE, BUT IT'S NOT GOOD.\n>> YEAH, LOOK, MIKE PENCE REALLY DID A LOT FOR DONALD TRUMP\nTODAY, AS FAR AS IT GOES, BY SAYING THE CLINTONS ARE MORALLY\nFLAWED AND THEIR MORAL FLAWS INVOLVE PUBLIC BEHAVIOR, AND\nELECTED OFFICE BEHAVIOR, NOT PRIVATE BEHAVIOR, AND\nEMPHASIZING IDEAS. THE PROBLEM WITH RYAN'S\nREPUDIATION OF TRUMP IS HE'S BASICALLY SAYING, I DON'T CARE\nABOUT TRUMP'S IDEAS. I DON'T CARE THAT HE AGREES WITH\nME ON SOME POLICY ISSUES ANYMORE.\nI ONLY CARE ABOUT THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN AGENDA.\nTHAT'S DANGEROUS, BECAUSE TRUMP AND PENCE BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN\nSIMULTANEOUSLY ATTACK BILL CLINTON, ATTACK HILLARY CLINTON,\nAND TALK ABOUT IDEAS, TALK ABOUT THINGS LIKE JUDGES, ET CETERA.\nDONNY, HOW DAMAGING DO YOU THINK THAT PAUL RYAN'S STATEMENT TODAY\nIS FOR TRUMP IN TERMS OF TRYING TO GET SOME MOMENTUM BACK?\n>> ZERO DAMAGE. YOU HAVE TWO CANDIDATES WITH\n100% BRAND AWARENESS. VERY, VERY CLEAR PERSONALITIES.\nENDORSEMENTS ON EITHER SIDE ARE ALMOST IRRELEVANT AT THIS POINT.\n>> I WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT ONE THING, JUST FROM HERE.\nDONALD TRUMP SPENT A LOT OF THIS SPEECH JUST NOW ATTACKING FREE\nTRADE AND ATTACKING ENTITLEMENT REFORM.\nYOU WONDER WHY PAUL RYAN DOESN'T WANT TO HAVE ANY PART OF DONALD\nTRUMP ON THE QUESTION OF IDEAS, MARK.\nTHAT'S PART OF THE REASON. THEY DON'T AGREE ABOUT MUCH OF\nANYTHING AT THIS POINT. AND I THINK HE RECOGNIZED THAT\nTRUMP IS ALMOST CERTAIN TO LOSE NOW, AS DONNY SUGGESTED.\nA NUMBER OF TRUMP'S ATTACK LINES LAST NIGHT AT THE DEBATE CAME\nFROM HACKED CLINTON CAMPAIGN E-MAILS, THAT WERE PUBLISHED BY\nWIKILEAKS. THE SITE POSTED ANOTHER DOCUMENT\nDUMP TODAY. IT DIDN'T CONTAIN ANY MORTAL\nTHREATS TO CLINTON, AS FAR AS WE KNOW AT THIS POINT, BUT IT DID\nINCLUDE CAMPAIGN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HOW TO ATTACK BERNIE\nSANDERS DURING THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION CONTEST AS WELL AS\nE-MAILS FROM LONGTIME CLINTON AIDE, DOUG BAND, SAYING SOME\nUNFLATTERING THINGS ABOUT CHELSEA CLINTON.\nMORE THAN ANYTHING, THE DOCUMENTS PORTEND THAT MORE\nLEAKS MAY BE IN THE OFFING IN THE DAYS AHEAD.\nIN ST. LOUIS LAST NIGHT, CLINTON CHOSE TO PLAY IT PRETTY SAFE\nWHEN SHE WAS FACED WITH ACCUSATIONS AND ATTACKS ON THE\nFRONT OF HER E-MAILS. SHE ALSO DIDN'T SPEND MUCH TIME\nHAMMERING AWAY AT TRUMP. SHE SORT OF RESISTED RISING TO\nTHE BAIT. SHE WAS BASICALLY DOING THE FOUR\nCORNERS OFFENSE OR THE PREVENT DEFENSE.\nSO GIVEN THE PROSPECT OF MORE OCTOBER SURPRISES AHEAD, MARK,\nESPECIALLY IN RELATION TO THIS E-MAIL STUFF, DO YOU THINK THIS\nIS A WINNING STRATEGY FOR  >> WELL, THE BAR IS REALLY HIGH.\nBECAUSE CLINTON HERSELF, AND HER TEAM, WORK IN A COORDINATED\nWELL-TRAINED PRACTICE, IN RESPONDING TO DISCLOSURES AND TO\nOCTOBER SURPRISES. THEY'RE NOT IN AS MUCH DANGER AS\nTRUMP. TRUMP IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO THESE\nTHINGS. THE CLINTON TEAM KNOWS HOW TO\nDEAL WITH THEM. HILLARY CLINTON HERSELF DOES.\nSO I THINK -- I THINK PLAYING IT SAFE IS PROBABLY THE RIGHT THING\nFOR HER FOOD, WHEN SHE TAKES RISKS, SHE'S NOT ALWAYS THE BEST\nPERFORM. AND LIKE I SAID, I THINK IT'S\nGOING TO TAKE A BIG DISCLOSURE TO BE A PROBLEM.\nDONNY, DO YOU THINK ALL THESE FORCED METAPHORS COME INTO\nPOLITICS ALL THE TIME. DO YOU THINK FOUR CORNERS\nOFFENSE, I SAY PROUDLY HERE IN THE TAR HEEL STATE, IS THE RIGHT\nMOVE FOR HILLARY CLINTON? OR DOES SHE NEED TO KEEP TAKING\nCHANCES TO MAKE SURE SHE DOESN'T BLOW IT?\n>> WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS IN THE NEXT SEGMENT.\nLET'S SAY SHE FIRED BACK AT TRUMP AND WHAT HE WAS SAYING\nABOUT HER HUSBAND. THE STORY TODAY WOULD HAVE BEEN\nABOUT THAT. THE STORY NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO\nBE ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND DONALD TRUMP AND WOMEN.\nSO WHAT SHE NEEDS TO DO IS CONTINUE THIS ROPE-A-DOPE\nSTRATEGY. I THINK IT WAS VERY DELIBERATE\nTHAT SHE DID NOT RESPOND, AND I THINK THEY WANT TO RUN OUT THE\nCLOCK WITHOUT SEEMING DEFENSIVE. LET DONALD TRUMP CONTINUE TO\nDEFINE THIS ELECTION. HE'S UNELECTABLE IN HIS CURRENT\nFORM. >> I CAN TELL YOU WHAT'S GOING\nTO HAPPEN, THE CLOSER WE GET TO ELECTION DAY -- THE CLOSER -- GO\nAHEAD. >> NO, NO, NO. GO AHEAD.\nFINISH YOUR STATEMENT. GO AHEAD.\n>> THE CLOSER WE GET TO ELECTION DAY, THE MORE WE'RE GOING TO\nHEAR RIGHT FROM THE OLD CLINTON CLASSIC FACEBOOK, THIS STUFF'S\nCOMING OUT BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO STEAL THE ELECTION OR\nTAKE THE ELECTION AWAY FROM YOU. THEY WANT THE ELECTION TO BE\nABOUT MY YESTERDAYS, I WANT IT TO BE ABOUT YOUR TOMORROWS.\nWE HEARD IT IN 1992. THE CLINTON PEOPLE WILL TROT\nTHAT OUT FOR SURE THE CLOSER WE GET TO ELECTION DAY.\n>> AND TRUMP THREE TIMES HERE TODAY, THREE TIMES, SAID, WE\nDON'T WANT TO LET THIS ELECTION GET STOLEN FROM US.\nYOU'LL HEAR A LOT OF VERY SIMILAR KINDS OF CLAIMS GOING IN\nBOTH DIRECTIONS. RIGHT NOW DONALD TRUMP'S IN THE\n30s. HE'S IN THE 30s.\nAND THE PERFORMANCE HE GAVE HERE NOW AND THE PERFORMANCE HE GAVE\nON THE DEBATE STAGE LAST NIGHT WERE PERFORMANCES DESIGNED TO\nROWS HIS BASE. AND HIS BASE CAN BE AS ROUSED AS\nALL GET OUT, BUT IF HE'S IN THE 30s, HE'S NOT -- AS YOU PUT IT,\nMARK -- INHALING DISTANCE OF BEING ABLE TO WIN THIS ELECTION.\nSO THIS IS A GREAT STRATEGY TO MAKE THE BASE FEEL GREAT ABOUT\nHIM, BUT IT'S NOT A STRATEGY TO WIN.\n>> YEAH. IT'S GOING TO BE INTERESTING TO\nSEE WHEN THE CAMPAIGN ITSELF GETS THEIR OWN POLLING DATA BACK\nDURING THIS WEEK AND REPUBLICAN GROUPS WHO THEY SHARE DATA,\nSOMETIMES, PROPERLY, SOMETIMES NOT.\nIT'S GOING TO BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THEY REACT IF THEY SEE\nTHEY NEED TO CHANGE COURSE.",

DAN --\n>> INFORMAL, INFORMAL. >> GIVEN THAT THE SPEAKER --\nINFORMAL, BUT NEVERTHELESS, AN ADVISER.\nGIVEN THAT THE SPEAKER WAS IN THE NEWS TODAY, SO PAUL RYAN\nSAYS TO HIS MEMBERS, HE SAYS, NUMBER ONE, I'M NOT GOING TO\nRETRACT MY ENDORSEMENT FROM DONALD TRUMP, BUT I'M NOT GOING\nTO DEFEND HIM, NOT GOING TO ARGUE FOR HIM, NOT GOING TO\nCAMPAIGN FOR HIM, Y'ALL SHOULD DO WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO TO\nSAVE YOUR SKINS. TELL US ABOUT THE THINKING THAT\nWENT INTO HIM COMING TO THAT PLACE.\n>> WELL, LIKE MANY REPUBLICAN LEADERS, THE SPEAKER WAS PRETTY\nREPULSED BY WHAT HE HEARD FROM THAT AUDIO RECORDING OVER THE\nWEEKEND. AND HE FELT THAT THIS WAS\nDIFFERENT THAN A LOT OF THE THINGS WE'VE HEARD IN THE PAST\nAND SO HE HAD THAT REACTION, THAT VERY STRONG REACTION,\nBASICALLY SAYING, I DON'T WANT TO BE A PART OF THE TRUMP\nPRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. AND THAT'S SORT OF ONE EQUITY.\nAND HE'S GOING TO BALANCE THAT WITH ANOTHER EQUITY, WHICH IS\nTHAT HE'S RESPONSIBLE FOR KEEPING THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN\nMAJORITY IN MAJORITY POSITION. IN FACT, IT'S THE LAST CHECK\nAGAINST, IF HILLARY WINS AND WINS BIG, WHICH LOOKS\nINCREASINGLY LIKELY, THAN SHE'S PROBABLY GOING TO TAKE THE\nSENATE WITH HER. AND THE ONLY THING STANDING\nBETWEEN A CLINTON PRESIDENCY AND CLINTON OVERREACH AND SOME HOPE\nFOR NORMALCY IS THE HOUSE MAJORITY.\nAND SO HE'S TELLING HIS MEMBERS, DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO TO HELP US\nPRESERVE THIS MAJORITY. AND THAT'S -- THOSE ARE THE TWO\nEQUITIES HE'S BALANCING. >> SO, DAN, IF YOU'RE GOING TO\nGO THAT FAR. IF YOU'RE GOING TO SAY, I DON'T\nWANT TO BE PART OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, I'M APPALLED BY WHAT\nHAPPENED, I DON'T WANT A CAMPAIGN FORUM, WHY NOT GO THE\nLAST MILE AND SAY, I WITHDRAW MY ENDORSEMENT.\nWHAT'S POSSIBLY HOLDING SPEAKER RYAN BACK FROM GOING ALL THE\nWAY? >> WELL, THIS IS MY VIEW.\nTHERE ARE A LOT OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS IN A LOT OF DISTRICTS WHO\nARE TRUMP DIE-HARDS. THEY'RE GOING TO BE WITH TRUMP,\nYOU KNOW, THROUGH THICK AND THIN.\nAND I THINK THERE'S A SENSE AMONG SOME IN THE REPUBLICAN\nLEADERSHIP THAT IF THEY ARE AT WAR WITH TRUMP, ALONG THE LINES\nTHAT YOU JUST ARTICULATED, THEY ARE AT WAR, THEN, WITH THOSE\nREPUBLICAN VOTERS, THOSE TRUMP VOTERS.\nAND IN SOME CASES, THAT COULD BE -- MEAN THE DIFFERENCE\nBETWEEN CERTAIN REPUBLICAN MEMBERS HANGING ON TO THEIR\nSEATS AND NOT. AND SO I THINK SPEAKER RYAN FELT\nLIKE HE MADE HIS POINT, ALL RIGHT?\nHE'S DONE WI HE'S DONE DEFENDING HIM, HE'S\nNOT GOING TO APPEAR WITH HIM. HE'S DONE.\nBUT HE'S NOT GOING TO GET INTO SORT OF AN OPEN WARFARE\nSITUATION WITH TRUMP IF IT MEANS RISKING REPUBLICANS BEING ABLE\nTO HANG ON TO THEIR MAJORITY, BECAUSE IT'S THE ON THING THEY\nHAVE TO PROTECT AGAINST THE CLINTON AGENDA.\n>> DAN, I WANT TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON, FROM\nA SOCIOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW. AND I'VE ASKED YOU QUESTIONS\nLIKE THIS BEFORE IN THE CONTEXT OF, PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN NEVER\nTRUMP AND THOSE WHO HAVEN'T. THIS WEEKEND, YOU HAD A NUMBER\nOF ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO WERE IN TOUGH RACES, WHO REPUDIATED\nTRUMP, EITHER SAID HE SHOULDN'T BE THE NOMINEE OR TOOK BACK\nTHEIR ENDORSEMENTS. THEN YOU HAD A FEW PEOPLE LIKE\nJOHN THUNE, NUMBER THREE SENATE REPUBLICAN, NOT UP FOR\nRE-ELECTION, WHO ALSO SAID, YOU KNOW, TRUMP SHOULDN'T BE OUR\nNOMINEE. WHAT'S CAUSING SOME PEOPLE TO\nSAY THAT AND MANY OTHER PEOPLE WHO MAY BE REPULSED, BUT AREN'T\nWITHDRAWING THEIR ENDORSEMENT OR QUESTIONING WHETHER TRUMP SHOULD\nBE THE PEOPLE? >> LOOK, I THINK THAT SOME\nPEOPLE ARE JUST MAKING THAT GUT REACTION.\nI HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO JOHN THUNE. I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO ROB PORTMAN\nOVER THE WEEKEND. I SPOKE TO SOME OTHER MEMBERS,\nBUT HAVE NOT BEEN IN TOUCH WITH EITHER OF THEM.\nI THINK IN THOSE CASES, IT WAS PROBABLY JUST A GUT REACTION.\nTHIS JUST DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT. THIS FELT DIFFERENT AND THEY HAD\nTO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT. I THINK OTHER MEMBERS ARE JUST\nMAKING THE FOLLOWING CALCULATION.\nTHERE ARE SOME REPUBLICAN VOTERS IN MY DISTRICT OR MY STATE WHO\nARE SO REPULSED MY TRUMP AND THIS ELECTION THAT THERE'S A\nGOOD CHANCE THEY'LL STAY HOME. AND THEY STAY HOME, THAT HURTS\nTHE DOWN-BALLOT. THERE ARE ANOTHER GROUP OF\nREPUBLICAN VOTERS THAT ARE SO ENERGIZED AND LOYAL TO TRUMP\nTHAT IF WE GO TO WAR WITH TRUMP, THEY WILL TAKE IT OUT ON US.\nSO WHICH POOL IS BIGGER? WHICH POOL IS MORE IMPORTANT?\nI THINK CERTAIN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ARE MAKING THAT\nDECISION. AS TO WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTIES, ALL THESE FOLKS ARE THINKING IT THROUGH,\nTO THE CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT, JUST CONSIDER THIS.\nTODAY, A COUPLE OF SENIOR REPUBLICAN POLITICAL LEADERS\nWERE ASKED THE QUESTION, IS WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAID IN THAT VIDEO,\nIN THAT RECORDING, ON THE HOT MIKE, TALKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW,\nFORCIBLY GRABBING A WOMAN'S GENITALS AGAINST HER WILL, DOES\nTHAT CONSIDER -- DOES THAT QUALIFY AS SEXUAL ASSAULT?\nAND YOU HAD ACTUAL REPUBLICAN POLITICIANS SAYING, THEY DIDN'T\nKNOW OR THEY COULDN'T COMMENT ON THAT.\nI MEAN, TO ME THIS IS LIKE A TODD AKIN MOMENT FROM 2012,\nWHERE THIS IS WHAT OUR PARTY HAS BEEN REDUCED TO.\nWE'VE BEEN REDUCED TO SENIOR LEADERS OF OUR PARTY ACTUALLY\nNOT BE ABLE TO SAY, YES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT\nTRUMP DID THOSE THINGS, WHAT HE SAID HE DID, THE DESCRIPTION OF\nTHAT ACT, THAT ACT IS SEXUAL ASSAULT.\nAND SO, I -- IT'S JUST DISHEARTENING TO WATCH\nREPUBLICAN LEADERS FROM ACROSS THE BOARD HERE, YOU KNOW, BEING\nPUT IN THAT SITUATION. I MEAN, THIS IS THE CARNAGE THAT\nTRUMP HAS LEFT BEHIND OR WILL LEAVE BEHIND.\n>> DAN, REAL QUICK, JUST A FEW MOMENTS, DOES DONALD TRUMP HAVE\nA CHANCE TO GET OVER 45% OF THE POPULAR VOTE?\nOR DO YOU THINK HE'S NOW GOT A CEILING BECAUSE OF THE LAST\nCOUPLE OF WEEKS. >> I THINK HE'S GOT A CEILING,\nMARK. LOOK, I SAW ONE POLL THAT ONE IN\nFOUR REPUBLICANS THINK THAT TRUMP SHOULD NOT BE THE NOMINEE.\nIF YOU'RE THREE TO FOUR WEEKS OUT FROM ELECTION DAY AND ONE IN\nFOUR OF YOUR VOTERS DON'T EVEN BELIEVE YOU SHOULD BE THE\nNOMINEE, THAT'S THE NEW STANDARD.\nTHE NEW STANDARD HEADING INTO THIS DEBATE WAS NOT CAN TRUMP\nWIN THE ELECTION, THE NEW STANDARD WAS, COULD HE DO WELL\nENOUGH IN THE DEBATE THAT HE CAN STILL CONTINUE AS NOMINEE, THAT\nHE WON'T BE DISLODGED? SO I THINK LAST NIGHT FOR HIM\nWAS ALL ABOUT REASSURING HIS BASE AND HIS VOTERS AND THAT'S\nWHAT NEXT THREE WEEKS ARE GOING TO BE ABOUT.\nTHEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABOUT BUILDING ANY KIND OF COALITION\nTHAT CAN WIN, NOT EVEN GETTING YOU TO 45 TO 48%.\n>> DAN, IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE DONALD TRUMP IS DOING EXACTLY\nWHAT YOU SAID AND ALSO IS GOING TO BE PERFECTLY HAPPY TRYING TO\nTAKE A LOT OF REPUBLICANS DOWN WITH HIM, INCLUDING ON THE BASE\nOF HIS TWEETS TODAY, MAYBE ATTEMPTING TRYING TO TAKE PAUL\nRYAN DOWN AS WELL. WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH\nTHAT.",

THEY ARE LOOKING, JOHN, AT WHAT\nHAPPENED LAST NIGHT. THEY ARE MORE COMFORTABLE WITH\nTRUMP ON MONDAY MORNING THAN THEY WERE ON SUNDAY MORNING.\nWE WILL SEE WHERE THIS GOES. JOHN: THANK YOU, JOHN.\nJENNA: HILLARY CLINTON GEARS UP TO MICHIGAN BEFORE HEADING TO\nBATTLEGROUND STATE OF OHIO. NEW REACTION OF MEMBERS OF HER\nOWN PARTY OF HER PERFORMANCE. BLAKE BERMAN WITH THE FOX\nBUSINESS NETWORK IS LIVE WITH MORE.\nBLAKE. BLAKE: GOOD MORNING TO YOU FROM\nST. LOUIS. SHE SPOKE BRIEFLY WITH REPORTERS\nON HER PLANE AS SHE HEADED BACK TO NEW YORK.\nSHE SAID SHE FELT GREAT ABOUT HOW THINGS WEPT LAST NIGHT AND\nSAID IT WASN'T TOUGHER THAN SHE HE SHALL WANTED.\n-- SHE EXPECTED. EARLIER THIS MORNING THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN IN THE FORM OF ITS CAMPAIGN MANAGER SAID THAT THEY\nWERE DISAPPOINTED AT THAT STUBT. THAT'S THE WAY HE DESCRIBED\nPRIOR TO THE DEBATE. THEY SAID THAT TRUMP THROUGHOUT\nTHE NIGHT TRIED TO THROW MUD AND KNOCK CLINTON OUT OF HER GAME\nAND THAT CLINTON WITH STOOD IT AND TRUMP FAILED.\nTRUMP SAID THAT SHOULD HE BECOME PRESIDENT, THAT HIS\nADMINISTRATION WOULD PROSECUTE CLINTON WHILE EARLIER THIS\nMORNING TRUMP OWES CLINTON AN APOLOGY.\n>> I WOULD SAY IT'S CHILLING THAT DONALD TRUMP THINK THAT IS\nTHE PRESIDENCY IS LIKE SOME BANANA REPUBLIC LEADERSHIP WHERE\nYOU CAN LOCK UP POLITICAL OPPONENTS.\nI THINK HE SHOULD APOLOGIZE.

SHE WILL BE ON TWO DIFFERENT\nCOLLEGES FOR VOTER REGISTRATION DRIVE.\nTIM KAINE HAS A UNIQUE STRATEGY TODAY, HE WILL BE JOINED BY DAVE\nMATTHEWS WHO WILL PUT ON A CONCERT THERE.\nJOHN PEDESTA, CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN, WIKILEAKS HAS RELEASED A NEW\nBATCH OF PADESTA EMAILS. 2,000 PLUS IN TOTAL AND WE ARE\nGOING THROUGH THEM. JENNA, THANK YOU.\nJENNA: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. JOHN: FOR MORE NOW ON THE DEBATE\nAND HOW BOTH CANDIDATES DID LET'S BRING JOHN MCCORMACK.\nI THINK YOU HAVE TO AGREE THAT DONALD TRUMP HAD THE BIGGER HILL\nTO CLIMB LAST NIGHT. DID HE SUCCEED?\n>> AT TEND OF THE DAY, I DON'T THINK SO.\nSOME ARGUE THAT HE STOPPED THE BLEEDING.\nTHE INSTANT POLLING, THE REAL POLLING, NOT FAN POLLS, TRUMP\nNARROWLY LOST AND ANOTHER POLL BY CNN BIGGER LOSS.\nHERE IS THE PROBLEM, DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T NEED TO SIMPLY\nFIGHT HILLARY CLINTON TO WITHDRAW LAST NIGHT.\nHE NEEDED TO WIN, RESET THIS RACE.\nHE WENT INTO THIS DEBATE DOWN NEARLY DOUBLE DIGITS IN\nPENNSYLVANIA, COLORADO, VIRGINIA, HE NEEDED TO TURN THAT\nTHING AROUND AND I DON'T THINK HE ACCOMPLISHED THAT.\nTHIS WAS A DO OR DIE DEBATE AND I THINK SHE DIED.\nJOHN: ALL THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN MEMBERS ARE CALLING IN TO A\nCONFERENCE CALL, THEY'RE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING WHAT TO DO\nABOUT DONALD TRUMP, DO THEY DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM HIM, DO\nTHEY, YOU KNOW, CONTINUE WITH ENDORSING HIM?\nTHERE'S A LOT OF TURMOIL ON CAPITOL HILL OVER REMARKS THAT\nCAME ON TAPE ON FRIDAY NIGHT. JEFFREY WAS CITING IN THE WALL\nSTREET JOURNAL THAT HE SEES TRUMP NOW BEEN ELIBERATED FROM\nSENIOR LEADERS OF THE PARTY, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?\n>> I DO THINK TRUMP DID WELL ENOUGH LAST NIGHT.\nI WASN'T A COMPLETE MELTDOWN THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEE\nMIKE PENCE DROP OFF THE TICKET. IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT PAUL RYAN\nWOULD HAVE TRIED TO PULL THE PLUG FOR TRUMP.\nTHAT'S THROWN UP IN THE AIR. I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT\nTHEY'RE DOING TO DO. JERRY IS RIGHT, TRUMP WAS\nDEFINITELY TO THROW EVERYTHING OUT THERE.\nHE WENT NUCLEAR LAST NIGHT BRINGING OUT PEOPLE ACCUSED BILL\nCLINTON AND THE DEBATE COMMISSION STOPPED THAT FROM\nHAPPENING, SO VERY ROUGH FROM BOTH CANDIDATES.\nTRUMP FOR THE NEXT MONTH UNPREDICTABLE.\nNO ONE KNOW WHAT HE'S GOING THE SAY NEXT OR WHAT VIDEO IS GOING\nTO DROP NEXT. EVEN THOUGH HE GETS PASSED THE\nVULGAR VIDEO, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THERE.\nTHERE ARE WOMEN WHO HAVE ACCUSED TRUMP JUST WOMEN WHO HAVE\nACCUSED BILL CLINT OPEN. THE PROBLEM IS THAT BILL CLINTON\nISN'T ON THE TICKET BUT HILLARY IS.\nJOHN: THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT LIKE THE WAY TRUMP WENT AFTER HILLARY\nLAST NIGHT, PICK YOUR ISSUE, BUT HE WAS IN HER FACE ABOUT THE\nEMAILS, ABOUT THE RESET WITH RUSSIA, ABOUT EMBASSADOR IN\nBENGHAZI AND AWFUL LOT OF AMERICANS OVERWILLING TO -- I'M\nSORRY WILLING TO OVERLOOK WHAT CAME OUT ON FRIDAY BECAUSE THEY\nTHINK BIGGER PICTURE, HE TOOK IT TO HILLARY CLINTON ON SOME OF\nTHE ISSUES THAT THEY SEE AS HER BIGGEST FAULTS.\n>> WELL, THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. AT THE END OF THE DAY, I DON'T\nTHINK TRUMP CAN DO WORSE THAN 40%, MAYBE THE VERY HIGH 30's\nIF THINGS GO SOUTH BECAUSE WE ARE IN A DIVIDED COUNTRY.\nVERY POLARIZED COUNTRY WHERE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO VOTE THE\nISSUES AT THE END OF THE DAY OR THEY FIND HILLARY CLINTON IS\nEVEN MORE UNACCESSABLE THAN DONALD TRUMP.  YOU TAKE A LOOK\nBACK WHERE THINGS WERE 72 HOURS, AFTER TRUMP LOST FIRST DEBATE.\nEVERYONE ACKNOWLEDGED WASTED AN ENTIRE WEEK, HE NEEDED TO WIN,\nMAKE GAINS WITH COLLEGE-EDUCATED WOMEN AND EDUCATED MEN AND I\nDON'T THINK HE DID THAT. HE MIGHT HAVE FOUGHT TO A DRAW\nBUT NOT ENOUGH TO WIN THE RACE. JOHN: JOHN, THANK YOU.\n>> THANK YOU. JENNA: WE ARE GOING TO TALK MORE\nABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND REPUBLICANS WHETHER OR NOT\nTHEY'RE ABANDONING THEIR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.\nAFTER DOZENS OF GOP LAWMAKERS CONDEMNED TRUMP'S  COMMENTS\nABOUT WOMEN, WHAT COMES NEXT FOR THE PARTY?\nTHE FINAL QUESTION THAT GOT BOTH CANDIDATES COMPLEMENTING EACH\nOTHER.",

BETTER THAT HE HAD A GOOD NIGHT\nLAST NIGHT THAN A BAD NIGHT. JENNA: HAS BEEN NO FAN OF DONALD\nTRUMP AS WE LOOK AT THEIR WORK, THEY GO ONTO WRITE THAT THE CAKE\nIS BAKED AND HILLARY CLINTON WILL WIN THE ELECTION.\nLET ME READ THIS LINE. THAT IS IF THE PARTY DOES NOT\nCUT PARTY LOSE, THEN DEMOCRATS GET SENATE AND CARRY THE HOUSE.\nPAUL RYAN HAS SAID ACCORDING TO POLITICO THAT HE WILL NOT DEFEND\nDONALD TRUMP ANY FURTHER AND SPEND THE NEXT 29 DAYS KEEPING\nTHE HOUSE MAJORITY. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THOSE\nBREAKING COMMENTS FROM PAUL RYAN AND WHAT DO YOU THINK IS AT\nSTAKE FOR THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE?\n>> WELL, FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT RESPONSIBILITY AS THE\nLEADER OF THE REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE IS TO HELP REELECT THE\nREPUBLICAN MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE.\nSIMILARLY THE PRINCIPLE RESPONSIBILITY IS TO HELP\nREELECT THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IN THE SENATE.\nNEITHER OF TOP RESPONSIBILITIES IS TO ELECT THE REPUBLICAN\nPRESIDENT. THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN SO, IT WAS SO\nIN 2000 AND 2004 WHEN GEORGE W. BUSH WAS RUNNING.\nEVEN THOUGH WHEN DONALD TRUMP HAS SAID ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS\nPRIMARILY TALKING ABOUT ENDORSEMENT FROM COMPETITORS\nTHAT PARTY UNITY IS OVERRATED AFTER YOU MAY REMEMBER HE DIDN'T\nWANT TO ENDORSEMENT OF TED CRUZ. HE'S NOT A PARTY GUY.\nHE IS NOT BEEN A PARTY GUY. HIS LARGEST POLITICAL\nCONTRIBUTION WAS TO HELP ELECT HILLARY CLINTON -- EXCUSE ME, TO\nHELP ELECT NANCY PELOSI AND GENIUSLY CONTRIBUTED TO\nDEMOCRATS. HE OUGHT TO STAY FOCUSED ON HIS\nBUSINESS AND MY SENSE IS HE DOES HIMSELF NO GOOD BY SENDING OUT\nTWEETS SAYING LOOK AT THE REPUBLICANS WHO ARE DISTANCING\nTHEMSELVES FROM ME, THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE A PRICE TO PAY.\nTHAT'S THE WAY IT IS IN AMERICAN POLITICS.\nNOT EVERYBODY SUPPORTS THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE WITH THE SAME\nAMOUNT OF ENTHUSIASM AS -- AS OTHERS.\nJENNA: THAT'S WHY SOME TRUMP SUPPORTERS WOULD SAY THEY REALLY\nLIKE DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE HE ISN'T JUST PART OF THE CLUB IN\nWASHINGTON, D.C. THAT SOME DESCRIBE THE ESTABLISHMENT AS IT\nIS. THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES, KARL,\nCAN TRUMP WIN WITHOUT LAWMAKERS' SUPPORT?\n>> HE CAN'T WIN WITHOUT HAVING 90% PLUS OF REPUBLICANS BEHIND\nHIM AND THE WAY TO DO THAT IS TO FOCUS ON HIMSELF, TO SPEND MORE\nTIME, TO SPEND ALL OF HIS TIME MAKING A CASE FOR HIMSELF AND\nAGAINST HILLARY CLINTON AND KNOCK STUFF OF GOING AFTER\nREPUBLICANS. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SAY WHAT\nTHEY'RE GOING TO SAY RUNNING FOR OFFICES.\nTHERE WAS REPUBLICANS WHO DISTANCED THEMSELVES FROM GEORGE\nW. BUSH AND SAME THICK IN 2004. HE STAYED FOCUS ON HIS MISSION.\nTRUMP WILL BE WELL ADVISED TO DO THE SAME.\nJENNA: WE TALKED ABOUT YOUR POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE AND\nWHERE YOU'RE LOOKING TO SPEND MONEY AND A LOT OF THAT WAS DOWN\nBALLOT. WHERE ARE YOUR RESOURCES --\n>> VIRTUALLY ALL OF IT, $155 MILLION TO SENATE RACES.\nJENNA: TALK TO US ABOUT THAT? ARE SOME OF THOSE REPUBLICANS IN\nTHE RACE OF THEIR LIFE BECAUSE OF DONALD TRUMP OR IS IT BECAUSE\nOF OTHER ISSUES? >> WELL, WE ARE SPENDING OUR\nMONEY IN RACES ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY.\nWE'VE SPENT A LOT PREVIOUSLY IN OHIO AND FLORIDA.\nTHOSE RACES ARE LOOKING INCREASINGLY GOOD.\nWE WERE READY TO MOVE INTO ARIZONA BUT JOHN MCCAIN IS DOING\nA GOOD JOB. MOST OF THE RACES IN NEVADA,\nMISSOURI, INDIANA, NORTH CAROLINA, PENNSYLVANIA AND NEW\nHAMPSHIRE. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO SPEND IN\nFLORIDA. WE DON'T HAVE ANY FURTHER EXPEND\nSCHUIRS PLANNED IN OHIO. AND OUR OBJECT IS TO -- THERE\nARE 11 RACE THAT IS WILL DETERMINE THE CONTROL OF THE\nSENATE, 44 REPUBLICANS SEATS ARE EITHER NOT UP OR NOT BEING\nSERIOUSLY CONTESTED, 45 DEMOCRATS IN A SIMILAR PLACE, WE\nHAVE TO WIN SEVEN OF THE 11 IF THE REPUBLICANS LOSE THE WHITE\nHOUSE AND SIX OF THE 11 IF THEY DO WIN THE WHITE HOUSE AND OUR\nOBJECT IS TO GIVE THE REPUBLICANS AS -- A MAJORITY IN\nEITHER INSTANCE AND A COMFORTABLE MAJORITY IF\nPOSSIBLE. JENNA: QUICK FINAL QUESTION, A\nCENTRAL QUESTION TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY NOT JUST NOW\nBUT MOVING FORWARD, WHAT DO YOU THINK THE ELECTION CYCLE HAS\nMEANT AS FAR AS RECRUITING NEW MEMBERS TO SUPPORT REPUBLICAN\nLAWMAKERS, EITHER DONALD TRUMP OR MEMBER OF THE SENATE?\n>> WE DON'T KNOW YET BECAUSE REMEMBER, YOU JUST SAID RECRUIT\nNEW MEMBERS. DO WE LOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE LATINO\nREPUBLICANS, AFRICAN-AMERICAN REPUBLICANS AND MOST IMPORTANT\nOF ALL COLLEGE-EDUCATED SUBURBANIZED.\nWE WON'T KNOW IN DAYS. BERNIE SANDERS A NONDESCRIPTIVE\nBACK BENCHER WHO HAD NEVER RUN FOR OFFICE AS DEMOCRAT, GOT 47%\nOF THE VOTE AND IN OUR SIDE A MAN WHO HAS NOT BEEN A\nREPUBLICAN OVER THE COURSE OF HIS POLITICAL CAREER, OR OVER\nHIS ADULT LIFE, HE HAS GOTTEN 44%.\nSO BOTH PARTIES ARE FACING DISRUPTION IN HOW THEY DEAL WITH\nIT, WIN OR LOSE AFTER THE ELECTION, IT'S GOING TO BE\nINTERESTING TO WATCH. JENNA: TO SEE ABOUT THOSE --\nTHAT SHIFT, THE PARTY SHIFT IN WHAT WE WAY OR MAY NOT SEE.\nKARL, GOOD TO HAVE YOU IN THE PROGRAM.\n>> THANK YOU, JENNA.",

THERE IS NO DAY LIGHT AND HE\nCAME OUT WITH FULL THROATED SUPPORT OF DONALD TRUMP AND\nADDRESSED THE NEGATIVE ISSUE AND HE IS A FAITHFUL MAN AND MAN OF\nGOD AND HE HAS THAT. AND HE POINTED TO A COUPLE OF\nTHINGS. THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY TWO\nDIFFERENT PEOPLE, IT IS ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT FUTURE ANDICAL HE\nON THE WORLD ON FIRE AND REBUILDING THE MILITARY THAT IS\nUNDER A HUGE WEIGHT WITH NO SHIPS OR PLANES OR AMMUNITIONS\nAND IT IS UNDERREPRESENTED WITH CONGRESS AND YOU ARE TALKING\nABOUT A PERSON IN CHARLOTTE AND THAT STATE, IT IS A HUGE\nMILITARY STATE, AND HE PLAYED TO THAT BASE AND HE IS ALL FOR\nDONALD TRUMP, IT WAS A STRNG SPEECH AND STRONG OPEN FOR HIM.\n>> IF WE LOOK AT THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA, I WANT TO SEE\nTHE NEW POLLING, CLINTON IS UP BY TWO POINT AND IT IS NOT\nA HUGE AMOUNT. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MIKE PENCE\nHAVING TO SAY. IS IT TURNINGS PAGE AWAY FROM\nTHE LEAKED VIDEO TAPE. >> MIKE PENCE HAS A DIFFICULT\nJOB TO DO AND HE IS A SKILLED POLITICIAN AND I SAY THAT\nOBJECTIVELY AS A DEMOCRAT. HE IS DEFENDER IN CHIEF OF\nDONALD TRUMP AND THERE WERE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHERE MIKE PENCE\nWOULD BE. HE STEPPED ASIDE WITH THE PAUL\nRYAN VISIT IN WISCONSIN AND THERE WAS NOTABLY IN THE DEBATE\nP. DONALD TRUMP ACKNOWLEDGED\nPUBLICLY THEY HAVE DIFFERENCES ON SYRIA IN PARTICULAR.\nAND THE REPUBLICAN NEEDED TO SEE MIKE PENCE STEP UP AND WAS ON\nTIME TRUMP AND HE DID THAT. AND HE MASTERFULLY, FRANKLY\nTRYED TOUTE LIKEWISED AND HONESTLY TRIED TO USE IT TO\nFRAME AND PIVOT AWAY FROM WHAT WE SAW IN THE LAST 72 HOURS WITH\nTHAT TOUGH AND NASTY VIDEO FROM ACCESS HOLLYWOOD.\n>> AND I WANT TO STAY WITH YOU. YOU ARE ABLE TO TAKE IN WHAT\nBOTH PARTIES ARE DOING. ONE OF THE THINGS MIKE PENCE DID\nTALKING ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY. THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THE NEXT\nDEBATE. CHRIS WALLACE WILL BE MODERATING\nAND THAT IS THE CLOSEST ONE TO VOTING DAY AND ONE OF THAT\nGREATEST WEAKNESS FOR HILLARY CLINTON BECAUSE OF HER TIME AS\nSECRETARY OF STATE. AND HOW ARE YOU SEEING IT AS\nA DEMOCRAT. ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT THAT.\n>> YOU KNOW, THIS ENTIRE ELECTION IN MANY WAYS IS LESSER\nOF TWO EVIL AND THE AMERICAN PUBLIC HAS BEEN BE THE LOSERS.\nAND I THINK HILLARY CLINTON HAS VULNERABILITIES BECAUSE OF HER\nRECORD OF SECRETARY OF STATE AND E-MAIL AND BENGHAZI AND XYZ.\nAND CONVERSELY DONALD TRUMP IS NOT PARTICULARLY STRONG WITH THE\nDETAILS OF FOREIGN POLICY. ALL OVER THE BOARD WHEN IT COMES\nFROM EVERYTHING TO ISIS AND DEPORTATION AND CRIMIA AND\nUKRAINE AND ROLE OF RUSSIA WHICH I MONITOR CLOSELY AS A REGION OF\nINTEREST. HE TALKS TOUGH AND THAT IS\nAPPEALING, BUT HE LACKS THE SUBSTANCE THERE AND IT IS GOING\nTO BE A DRAW. I THINK IF DONALD TRUMP PREPARES\nWELL, HE CAN PERFORM AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON BY P DRAWING THE\nCONTRAST, BUT SHE COMES IN WITH SUBSTANCE OF DETAIL, THAT SHE\nHAS THE UPPER HAND REGARDLESS OF THE CHALLENGES SHE HAS IN HER\nREGARD. >> HOGAN, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF\nTHAT ASSESSMENT? >> WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A TIME\nIN OUR COUNTRY  WHERE ISIS IS ON THE MOVE AND NOT A JV TIME AS\nTHE PRESIDENT SUGGESTED. HILLARY CLINTON TETHERED HERSELF\nTO THE PRESIDENT'S POSITION AND SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE, THE\nWORLD IS ALLOWED TO BURN AND WE ARE NOT SAFER AND LIKE\nCAPRIMENTIONED, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE ARE SUFFERING BECAUSE\nWE ARE NOT PROTECTED. HILLARY CLINTON WANT UPONS\nUNVETTED FIVE PIST PERCENT INCREASE IN SYRIANS.\n>> IS TRUMP ENOUGH OR DOES HE NEED TO SHOW MORE MASTERY ON THE\nTOPIC OF FOREIGN POLICY? >> NOT MASTERY.\nBUT A HANDLE OF WHAT IS GOING ON OUT THERE, BUT TALK ABOUT THE\nSUBSTANCE THAT HILLARY CLINTON DOES HAVE AND THAT KNOWLEDGE AND\nSUBSTANCE ALLOWED MORE ARE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON AMERICAN\nSOIL ANY TIME IN HISTORY. PUT ALL OF THE PROBLEMS OF THE\nWORLD ON HILLARY'S SHOULDERS BECAUSE SHE WAS AT THE HELM AND\nALLOWED IT TO HAPPEN. WE ARE ARE NOT SAFE AND THEY\nKNOW IT IS IT HILLARY CLINTON'S FAULT.\n>> THIS IS WHERE THE DEBATE IS GOING TO GO NEXT.\nWHAT WILL THE NEXT WEEK LOOK LIKE.\nMIKE PENCE IS GIVING A STRONG DEFENSE, DONALD TRUMP TAKES TO\nTWITTER. WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE.\nWHERE THE FOCUS AND MEDIA FOLLOWS.\nAND DONALD TRUMP. PAUL RYAN SHOULD SPEND MORE TIME\nON BALANCING THE BUDGET AND JOB AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND NOT\nFIGHTING REPUBLICAN NOMINEE. >> AND CAPRI.\nWHAT ABOUT THE TIMING AND SUBSTANCE OF THE TWEET.\n>> OBVIOUSLY PAUL RYAN AND HOUSE REPUBLICANS HAD A CONFERENCE\nCALL AND BECOMELY PAUL RYAN SAID DO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO\nPROTECT YOURSELF.

I UNDERSTAND WHERE DONALD TRUMP\nIS COME CANNING FROM. I THINK HE IS SENSITIVE TO THE\nFACT THAT PAUL RYAN IS SHYING AWAY FROM HIM.\nAND PAUL RYAN HAS TO PROTECT THE HOUSE AND IF HE THINKS THAT\nDONALD TRUMP WILL BE A NOOSE HE WILL CUT AND RUN.\nTHAT'S POLITICS. >> HOGAN WHAT IS YOUR THOUGHTS\nON THIS? >> PAUL RYAN NEVER HAS BEEN\nA FAN OF DONALD TRUMP. PAUL RYAN STILL MADE DONALD\nTRUMP TO KISS HIS RING TO GET HIS SUPPORT.\nTHIS PROVES ONE THING.

SOME REPUBLICANS THINK THIS IS\nAN -- THAT THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE HAS AN OBLIGATION TO\nSUPPORT THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE. TECHNICALLY SPOKING THE SPEAKER\nOF THE HOUSE IS SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT BOTH PARTIES AND\nRESOLVING CONFLICTS OVER REGS TO COME TO BILLS AND SEND THEM TO\nTHE PRESIDENT IN THE LAST 20 YEARS THE SPEAKERSHIP IS MUCH\nMORE PARTISAN THAN IT WAS BACK IN THE DAY.\nHAVING SAID THAT, THERE ARE A LOT OF REPUBLICANS WHO ARE\nREALLY, REALLY WORRIED ABOUT THIS.\nTHE DEBATE PERFORMANCE LAST NIGHT, WENT OVER PRETTY WELL\nWITH REPUBLICANS BUT REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES RECOGNIZE THAT IN\nORDER TO WIN THEIR ELECTIONS FOR THE SENATE, FOR FOR, FOR\nALDERMAN, COUNCIL AND DOG CATCHER, THEY'RE GOING TO\nPROBABLY NEED SOMETHING MORE THAN REPUBLICAN CONSERVATIVE\nVOTES. MODERATES, SWING VOTES,\nINDEPENDENTS,LYBER TAREANS AND GREEN PARTY CANDIDATES, AND\nTRUMP PROBABLE LIVE DIDN'T MAKE A LOT OF -- MAKE UP A LOT OF\nGROUND WITH THEM. THE OTHER ASPECT IS THE POLLS\nOUT TODAY, \"THE WALL STREET \"THT JOURNAL\" NBC POLE SHOWS A DOUBLE\nDID LEAD FOR CLINTON NATIONWIDE, AND TRUMP DIDN'T USE THE WORD,\nSORRY, LAST NIGHT HE TURNED AROUND AND ATTACK HILLARY\nCLINTON AND DID SEE EFFECTIVELY.

PAUL RYAN TOOK A PASS ON THAT\nTHIS YEAR. HE COULD HAVE RUN.\nINSTEAD HE CHOSE TO BE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE.\nMIKE PENCE, GOVERNOR OF INDIANA, HAS OTHER ALTERNATIVES BUT COULD\nHAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMPETE IN 2020.\nIF DONALD TRUMP GOES DOWN, PENCE COULD GO WITH HIM OR PERHAPS\nRISE AGAIN IN NEXT FOUR YEARS.

WHICH IS GOOD NEW.\nI WISH ALL OF -- EVERYONE WOULD SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, I HAVE A\nPROBLEM WITH DONALD TRUMP, I DON'T LINE THE GUY FOR WHATEVER,\nNAME YOUR REASONS, BUT WE WOULD RATHER HAVE HIM THAN HILLARY\nCLINTON AND MAYBE GET SOME OF THE PARTY UNITY BACK WHERE WE\nDON'T RISK THE HOUSE -- I DON'T THINK WE'RE RISKING THE HOUSE,\nFOR THE RECORD. WE DON'T RISK THE SENATE.\nMAYBE WIN THE WHITE HOUSE AS WELL.\n>> DONALD TRUMP HAS SAID HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE DOWN\nBALLOT. HE IS NOT WORRIED ABOUT IT.\n>> I KIND OF FIND THIS UNITY PLEA A LITTLE BIT PRECIOUS AFTER\nTHIS LAST YEAR WHERE WE TORE APART THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, WENT\nAFTER EXPERIENCED CANDIDATES BECAUSE THEY WERE, QUOTE,\nESTABLISHMENT. I THINK THE CONFERENCE CALL\nWASN'T ABOUT LAST WEEK. IT'S ABOUT -- OR LAST WEEKEND.\nIT'S ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT.\nWHAT HAPPENS? WHEN IS THE OTHER SHOE GOING TO\nDROP? THE CAMPAIGN IS LIKE A CAR\nDRIVING ON THE FREE WAY AND THEY ARE RUNNING ON EMPTY AND THEY'RE\nNOT SURE WHAT EXIT TO GET OFF. LOYALTY IS OVERRATED.\nIT EXCUSES BEHAVIOR AT WORK, POLITICS AND LOVE.\nIT EXCUSES BAD BEHAVIOR. SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR\nPRINCIPL PRINCIPLES.\n>> THE OTHER GIRL. IF YOU DON'T MARRY THIS GIRL,\nTHE OTHER GIRL YOU ARE LEFT WITH, YOU MAY NOT LIKE EVEN\nWORSE THAN THIS ONE. >> THAT'S A WEIRD METAPHOR.\n>> I CAN GET JUAN IN HERE? SHOTGUN MARRIAGE IS WHEN YOU ARE\nPREGNANT. >> ONE QUICK -- I JUST WANT TO\nGET JUAN IN FOR ONE POINT. TODAY, HILLARY CLINTON'S\nSPOKESPERSON SAID THEY PLAN 20 TIE DONALD TRUMP TO ALL OF THE\nREPUBLICANS BASICALLY, IF YOU WANT TO BURN DOWN THE REPUBLICAN\nPARTY, IF YOU ARE IN FROM WHATEVER SIDE OF THE REPUBLICAN\nPARTY YOU WERE, YOU WANT TO BURN IT DOWN, IT'S HILLARY CLINTON\nTHAT SAID SHE'S HOLDING THE MATCH AND SHE'S READY TO STRIKE\nIT. >> THE DEMOCRATS ARE --\nDEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES ARE RUNNING ADS THAT TIE THEM TO\nDONALD TRUMP. LOOK AT NEW HAMPSHIRE.\nYEAH, SOMEONE MIKE SCHUMANN COULD LOOK UP TO.\nTHAT IS ALL OVER NEW HAMPSHIRE NOW.\nYOU KNOW WHAT STRUCK ME WAS IN THE POLL THIS MORNING FROM \"THE\nWALL STREET JOURNAL,\" THEY HAVE HILLARY CLINTON UP BY 11, I\nBELIEVE. I THINK THAT MIGHT BE HIGH.\nBUT THE KEY HERE WAS, LOWER AND LOWER RATES OF REPUBLICANS WERE\nWILLING TO STAND WITH DONALD TRUMP AFTER THE VIDEO ON FRIDAY.\nI THINK THAT'S A REAL TROUBLING SIGN FOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.\n>> LET'S SEE AFTER THIS DEBATE THE NUMBERS AND THEN AFTER THE\nVEGAS DEBATE. >> VEGAS, BABY.\n>> I NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE. >> WE WILL BE THERE.\n>> THERE WERE MANY AWKWARD MOMENTS AT LAST NIGHT'S DEBATE\nFROM THE BEGINNING UNTIL THE VERY END.\n>> WOULD EITHER OF YOU NAME ONE POSITIVE THING THAT YOU RESPECT\nIN ONE ANOTHER? >> ONE NICE THING AND THEN ONE\nMORE THING COMING UP. WHEN A MOMENT TURNS\nROMANTIC, WHY PAUSE\nTO TAKE A PILL? OR STOP TO FIND\nA BATHROOM?",

HERE WE ARE THIS MORNING.\nDON'T SD ME WHERE I WAS YESTERDAY.\nSO MUCH TO TALK ABOUT TODAY. DONALD TRUMP LAYING THE\nGROUNDWORK FOR -- DARING THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN TO COME OUT\nWITH MORE RESEARCH. FIGHTING HARD.\nWE'RE WAKING UP TO A DIFFERENT REPUBLICAN PARTY THIS MORNING\nTHAN WE HAD JUST A WEEK AGO. AFTER PAUL RYAN, THE SPEAKER OF\nTHE HOUSE SAID HE WOULD NO LONGER SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP, NOR\nWOULD HE CAMPAIGN FOR HIM IN THE NEXT 30 DAYS.\nRYAN TELLING A HOUSE GOP CONFERENCE CALL YESTERDAY,\nQUOTE, YOU NEED TO DO WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU IN YOUR DISTRICT.\nTHAT PROMPTED THIS RESPONSE FROM DONALD TRUMP SAYING PAUL RYAN\nSHOULD SPEND MORE TIME BALANCING THE BUDGET, JOBS AND ILLEGAL\nIMMIGRATION AND NOT WASTE HIS TIME FIGHTING THE REPUBLICAN\nNOMINEE. DONALD TRUMP ON THE OTHER FRONT\nWITH TWO BIG EVENTS IN PENNSYLVANIA GOING HARD AFTER\nHILLARY CLINTON AND EVEN THOUGH THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT SHE WAS\nBEHIND THE RELEASE OF THAT 11-YEAR-OLD TAPE FROM \"ACCESS\nHOLLYWOOD,\" DARING HER TO PILE ON WITH MORE TAPES.\nLISTEN TO THIS. >> I WAS GETTING BEATEN UP FOR\n72 HOURS ON ALL THE NETWORKS FOR INAPPROPRIATE WORDS 12 YEARS\nAGO. LOCKER ROOM TALK.\nWHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT. IF THEY WANT TO RELEASE MORE\nTAPES SAYING INAPPROPRIATE THINGS, WE'LL CONTINUE TO TALK\nABOUT BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON DOING INAPPROPRIATE THINGS.\nTHERE'S SO MANY OF THEM, FOLKS. >> AT WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY\nSUNDAY NIGHT, HE'S NOT AFRAID TO BRING IT UP.\nHE HAS A FULL DAY TODAY. LEAVING TRUMP TOWER IN THE NEXT\nCOUPLE OF HOURS HEADED FOR TEXAS WHERE HE HAS A FUNDRAISER AND\nOFF TO FLORIDA WHERE HE'LL SPEND A COUPLE OF DAYS ON THE CAMPAIGN\nTRAIL THERE TRYING TO TURN AROUND WHAT HAVE BEEN POLLS\nGOING THE WRONG DIRECTION IN THE LAST FEW DAYS.\nAINSLEY, BRIAN, STEVE. >> JOHN ROBERTS IN FRONT OF\nTRUMP TOWER. JOHN, YOU WERE IN ST. LOUIS\nYESTERDAY WITH ME. WE RAN OVER YOU WITH A GOLF\nCART. REMEMBER?\n>> YOU HAVE TO JUSTIFY YOUR EXPENSES.\nYOU HAVE TO NAME THE CITY. THERE'S A BLANK FOR THAT.\n>> I'M SOMETIMES ABLE TO TRACE BACK THE FLIGHTS.\nBUT SOMETIMES IT GETS FUZZY IN THE CONNECTION.\n>> WE WANTED TO KNOW WHO FELL OUT OF THE GOLF CART AT THE END\nOF THE SHOW. SOMEONE FELL OUT.\n>> YOU'LL FIND OUT -- >> THAT WAS MIKE EMANUEL.\n>> OH, NO. >> DID I SPOIL IT?\n>> THAT'S OKAY. WE'RE GOING TO SHOW THE VIDEO IF\n20 MINUTES. IT'S A GOOD TEASE.\n>> DON'T SAY IT. WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT.\n>> TAKE HIS SUIT TO THE DRY CLEANERS.\n>> IT MIGHT BE MIKE EMANUEL OR IT MIGHT NOT?\nHOW ABOUT THAT? >> IS HE OKAY?\n>> RIGHT. >> GOOD.\nDID HE SURVIVE? >> WILL HE EVER WORK AGAIN?\n>> REAL QUICK. IN TERMS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING\nWITH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, THEY CURRENTLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE\nPOLLS AS THEY WERE TAKEN OFF THE FRIDAY TAPE, LOOKS LIKE DONALD\nTRUMP IS DOWN BY DOUBLE DIGITS. I THINK THE REAL STORY WILL BE\nWHAT WILL THE POLLS LOOK LIKE AFTER THE PEOPLE DIGEST, THE 67\nMILLION WHO WATCHED, DIGEST THE DEBATE ON SUNDAY.\nTHEN I'LL -- >> WHEN DO THOSE NUMBERS COME\nOUT? >> SHORTLY.\nNONETHELESS, AS WE HEARD FROM JOHN ROBERTS WHAT'S GOING ON\nWITH PAUL RYAN YESTERDAY AND TALKING TO HIS CAUCUS.\nHE'S STILL ENDORSING DONALD TRUMP BUT WON'T CAMPAIGN WITH\nHIM. >> WHICH IS CURIOUS --\n>> HE DID ENDORSE HIM AND HE DIDN'T WALK HIM BACK.\n>> HE'S STILL ENDORSING, WON'T CAMPAIGN OR DEFEND TRUMP.\nFOR THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, IT'S OKAY FOR THEM TO DO THE\nSAME. IT'S INTERESTING.\nBECAUSE ALL ALONG THE MESSAGE HAS BEEN FROM REPUBLICANS,\nESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS. DONALD TRUMP IS NOT AN\nESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICAN, BUT NONETHELESS, THE ESTABLISHMENT\nHAS SAID, LOOK, HE'S NOT PERFECT.\nBUT HE'S OUR CANDIDATE AND SHE'S A LOT WORSE.\nREMEMBER, WE'VE GOT TO CONTROL WHO PICKS WHOM FOR THE SUPREME\nCOURT. SO HAS SOMETHING CHANGED?\n>> YES. >> HERE'S WHY.\nTHE REPUBLICANS AND THE HOUSE, THEY STILL WANT TO HAVE THE\nPOWER IN THE HOUSE. >> OH, SURE.\n>> SO THERE ARE 435 HOUSE MEMBERS.\nTHEY'RE ALL UP FOR REELECTION THIS YEAR.\n>> EVERY TWO YEARS. >> THEY'RE MORE WORRIED ABOUT\nTHEIR OWN RACES THAN ABOUT THE BIGGER RACE PROBABLY.\n>> WITH THAT SCHOOL OF THOUGHT, YOU COULD ACTUALLY DO THAT AND\nBE LOOKING OUT FOR YOUR PARTY. THE QUESTION IS, AFTER FRIDAY'S\nTAPES CAME OUT, IT'S NOT SO MUCH IS DONALD TRUMP UNPOPULAR OR\nPOPULAR, BUT IF YOU BACK SOMEBODY WHO SEEMS TO BE SO\nNEGATIVE TOWARDS WOMEN, EVEN THOUGH WE WALKED HIM BACK, THE\nANCILLARY DAMAGE COULD BE DEVASTATING.\n>> WILL IT AFFECT YOUR CAMPAIGN? MEANWHILE, MIKE HUCKABEE WEIGHED\nIN. >> HERE'S A SECRET, MEGGIN.\nA LOT OF THE BED WETTING X HAND WRINGING REPUBLICANS, THEY'RE\nNOT AFRAID DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO LOSE.\nTHEY'RE SCARED TO DEATH HE'S GOING TO WIN.\nIF HE WINS, HE'S GOING TO MESS UP THE NEAT LITTLE PACKAGE OF\nFUN THEY HAVE BECAUSE THEY ALL PLAY TO THE DONOR CLASS AND\nDONALD TRUMP IS COMING TO MAKE BIG CHANGES IN THE WAY THAT\nTHESE INSTITUTIONS GO. >> RIGHT.\nSO WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? E-MAIL US.\nJUST KNOW THAT IF THE PARTY ABANDONS DONALD TRUMP, 30 DAYS\nBEFORE THE ELECTION, THE NARRATIVE WILL BE HE LOST\nBECAUSE HE GOT STABBED IN THE BACK.\n>> A LOT OF REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING LIKE WHAT YOU WERE\nSAYING. YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE\nSUPREME COURT. THERE CAN BE FOUR JUSTICES --\n>> SO MANY REPUBLICANS. INSTEAD, HE'S BETTER THAN HER.\nWHAT CHANGED, IF ANYTHING CHANGED?\nOR ISN'T HE STILL THE GUY? >> THERE'S THE THEORY, IF THE\nREPUBLICANS DIDN'T JUMP SHIP BUT YOU CAN SAY THAT DONALD TRUMP\nDID A SERIES OF IRRATIONAL THINGS THAT CAUSED THE\nREPUBLICANS TO JUMP SHIP. >> HE'S A UNIQUE CHARACTER, NO\nDOUBT ABOUT IT.",

TYPICALLY, DOWN-BALLOT\nREPUBLICANS AND DOWN-BALLOT MEMBERS OF ANY PARTY ARE\nEXPECTED TO ENDORSE THEIR TOP LEADER AND TO CAMPAIGN FOR HIM\nALL THE WAY THROUGH THE END OF THE ELECTION DAY.\nTHIS IS A SIGNAL NOW THAT LEADERSHIP IS SAYING, NO, YOU\nCAN GO AHEAD, DO WHAT YOU FEEL YOU NEED TO DO.\nWE ALSO HAVE A TWEET HERE FROM HILLARY CLINTON JUST OVER THE\nPAST COUPLE OF SECONDS RESPONDING TO THIS NEWS ABOUT\nPAUL RYAN'S COMMENTS. CARL, HILLARY CLINTON TWEETING,\n\"RYAN IS STILL ENDORSING TRUMP.\" SO HILLARY CLINTON TRYING TO\nEXPLOIT THIS FRACTURE IN HERE OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP.\nBACK OVER TO YOU. >> EAMON, I'M WONDERING IF ANY\nWAY YOU FEEL PAUL RYAN HAS RECEIVED A SMOKE SIGNAL OR\nSOMETHING FROM REINCE PRIEBUS OF THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE, BECAUSE\nJUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO HE HAD BEEN TALKING ABOUT PUNISHMENT\nAHEAD FOR ANY REPUBLICAN THAT DID NOT SUPPORT THE REPUBLICAN\nNOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT.

THIS LANGUAGE FROM PAUL RYAN\nTHAT WE ARE TOLD, NBC NEWS IS TOLD, FROM SOMEBODY ON THE CALL,\nSAYING YOU ALL NEED TO DO WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU IN YOUR DISTRICT.\nTHAT IS A GO SIGNAL, A GREEN LIGHT, FOR THOSE REPUBLICANS WHO\nFELT LIKE THEY NEEDED TO START DENOUNCING DONALD TRUMP OR AT\nLEAST DISTANCING THEMSELVES FROM DONALD TRUMP.\nAND THE EXPECTATION THAT HE WOULDN'T WIN AND THAT HIS\nCONTINUED CANDIDACY COULD DAMAGE THEIR OWN CHANCES OF\nRE-ELECTION, THAT'S A SIGNAL FROM LEADERSHIP, YOU'RE NOT\nGOING TO FACE PUNISHMENT FROM THE TOP BRASS IF YOU GO AHEAD\nAND DO THAT. THAT IS RELATIVELY RARE IN\nPOLITICS. IT'S HAPPENED BEFORE IN NATIONAL\nCAMPAIGNS WHEN THE RANK AND FILE FEEL LIKE THE TOP OF THE TICKET\nISN'T GOING ANYWHERE, BUT THAT'S A STRONG SIGNAL OF WHERE\nREPUBLICANS SEE THEMSELVES NOW JUST A MONTH OUT FROM ELECTION\nDAY. >> EAMON, HOW DOES IT DOVE TAIL,\nAGAIN, WITH REPORTS OVER THE WEEKEND THAT RNC RESOURCES WOULD\nBE SIMILARLY DIRECTED TO THE DOWN BALLOT?\n>> AGAIN, YOU KNOW, IT'S A QUESTION OF FINITE RESOURCES,\nCARL. YOU ONLY HAVE SO MUCH MONEY, SO\nMUCH TIME, SO MANY STAFFERS. YOU HAVE TO FOCUS IN AREAS WHERE\nYOU THINK YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IF THE RNC HAS\nCONCLUDED IT CAN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE OR NEED TO AT LEAST\nPUT A PAUSE ON ITS EFFORTS TO HELP DONALD TRUMP.\nTHAT'S A LOT OF RESOURCES THEY CAN THEN REDIRECT DOWN BALLOT TO\nSHORE UP THOSE REPUBLICANS. YOU LOOK AT PAUL RYAN AND THE\nEXQUISITELY PAINFUL POLITICAL POSITION HE'S IN RIGHT NOW, IF\nYOU TALK ABOUT REPUBLICANS LOSING SIGNIFICANT SEATS IN THE\nHOUSE, SAY THEY KEEP THE MAJORITY, BUT THEY LOSE NOT 30,\nBUT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ONE AND 30 SEATS, DEPENDING ON WHERE THAT\nSLIDING SCALE ENDS UP ON ELECTION DAY, PAUL RYAN COULD BE\nDEALING WITH A MUCH MORE CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN\nCONFERENCE GOING INTO THE NEXT CONGRESS THAN HE'S DEALING WITH\nNOW, BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKELY TO BE DEFEATED HERE ON\nTHE REPUBLICAN SIDE WILL BE THOSE SUBURBAN REPUBLICANS WHO\nARE QUOTE, UNQUOTE, MODERATES. SO THAT COULD BE ALSO AFFECTING\nPAUL RYAN'S LONG-TERM OUTLOOK OF WHAT HE CAN DO AT THE CONFERENCE\nAND WHETHER HE CAN CONTINUE TO LEAD IT.\nSO A WHOLE BUNCH AT STAKE HERE FOR THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE\nTODAY. >> THINKING, EAMON, ALL THOSE\nTIMES WE TALK ABOUT THE TIGHT ROPE THAT JOHN BOEHNER HAD TO\nWALK, THAT LOOKS EASY IN COMPARISON TO WHAT RYAN HAS IN\nFRONT OF HIM NOW.",

PAUL RYAN'S A TRUE CONSERVATIVE\nWHEN IT COMES TO BOTH FAMILY VALUES AND ECONOMIC VALUES.\nPAUL RYAN IS A, YOU KNOW, DEEPLY DECENT AND MORAL PERSON, WHO\nWANTED THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TO BE MORE INCLUSIVE, AND I THINK\nHE'S ALWAYS BEEN AGONIZED ABOUT THE FACT THAT TRUMP BECAME THE\nNOMINEE AND NOW HE'S DISTANCING HIMSELF.\nSO THIS IS NOT A SURPRISE. MAYBE THE SURPRISE IS THAT IT\nTOOK THIS LONG. >> WHAT IS THE RISK TO SOME OF\nTHE DOWN-BALLOT CANDIDATES, WALTER, ABOUT MAKING A PUBLIC\nSTATEMENT OR DENOUNCING DONALD TRUMP PUBLICLY?\nBECAUSE WHEN PAUL RYAN WITHHELD HIS ENDORSEMENT OF TRUMP, TRUMP\nTURNED ON HIM AND TRIED TO WEAKEN HIM IN HIS HOME STATE.\n>> YEAH, I THINK DONALD TRUMP, WE'VE SEEN CLEAR ONE OF HIS\nSPOKESPERSONS SAID, YOU KNOW, THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALSO\nCOMMITTED SEXUAL ASSAULT OR SOMETHING, SO THERE WILL BE\nUNLEASHED A BARRAGE FROM, I THINK, TRUMP AND CERTAINLY TRUMP\nSUPPORTERS AGAINST SOME OF THESE PEOPLE, BUT AT A CERTAIN POINT\nIT'S A QUESTION OF HONOR, IT'S A QUESTION OF MORALS, IT'S A\nQUESTION OF HOW YOU WANT TO BE REMEMBERED, AND ALSO IT'S A\nQUESTION OF POLITICS. AND, OF COURSE, I THINK IT PLAYS\nWELL POLITICALLY TO SAY I'M DISTANCING MYSELF FROM THIS GUY,\nEVEN IF YOU DO GET A BARRAGE FROM SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE\nSUPPORTERS. >> WALTER, IT'S JOHN FORD.\nI'M HOPING YOU CAN PUT THIS INTO HISTORICAL CONTEXT FOR US, BEING\nA STUDENT OF HISTORY THAT YOU ARE.\nI MEAN, GEORGE WASHINGTON EVEN ENDURED POLITICS OF PERSONAL\nATTACK, THEN, OF COURSE, WE HAD THE WHOLE FEDERALIST BREAKDOWN,\nHAMILTON VERSUS JEFFERSON. HAMILTON VERSUS ADAMS.\nTHE FEDERALISTS EVENTUALLY WENT AWAY ENTIRELY.\nWHAT IS AT RISK HERE WITH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, GIVEN NOT JUST\nTHE RANCOR IN THE CAMPAIGN, DEMOCRAT VERSUS REPUBLICAN, BUT\nTHIS REPUBLICAN ON REPUBLICAN DISCORD?\n>> JOHN, YOU'RE A GOOD STUDENT OF HISTORY, TOO, DURING THE\nFEDERALIST PERIOD WHERE YOU HAD, YOU KNOW, THOMAS JEFFERSON\nALLEGATIONS, SOME OF WHICH WERE TRUE.\nTHIS HAS BEEN A PART OF HISTORY AND, CERTAINLY, THE CIVIL WAR\nWAS A TIME NOT REALLY AS PERSONAL, BUT WHERE THE DIVIDE\nWAS SO DEEPER. I DO THINK, I HOPE, BUT I'M A\nWILD OPTIMIST LIKE LARRY KUDLOW WAS IN THE EARLIER HOUR, I DO\nHOPE THAT THIS BREAKS THE FEVER AND MAYBE EVEN CREATES A NEW\nPOLITICS IN WHICH AS A CENTER RIGHT PARTY AND A CENTER LEFT\nPARTY THAT'S NOT BASED ON PERSONAL VITRIOL WHEN IT COMES\nTO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, BUT A REPUBLICAN PARTY OF PAUL RYAN,\nOF MICHAEL PENCE, OF, YOU KNOW, SCOTT WALKER.\nIF YOU END UP BREAKING THE FEVER AND HAVING A REPUBLICAN PARTY\nTHAT'S CENTER RIGHT AND CONSERVATIVE BUT BELIEVES IN\nSORT OF CONSTITUTIONISTS AND LIBERTARIAN VALUES RATHER THAN\nTHESE AUTHORITARIAN VALUES THAT YOU SAW TRUMP EXPOSE OR THE\nPERSONAL VENOM, YOU KNOW, AND BRINGING OUT RACIAL HATREDS,\nBRINGING OUT ETHNIC HATREDS, IF YOU HAVE A REPUBLICAN PARTY JUST\nGOING BACK TO THE REAGAN REPUBLICAN PARTY, THAT WOULD BE\nENORMOUS USE AND MAYBE CONCEIVABLY YOU COULD EVEN SEE\nSOMETHING THAT HAPPENED THREE OR FOUR TIMES IN OUR HISTORY, A\nTHIRD PARTY EMERGE IF NECESSARY. >> SOMETHING A LOT OF PEOPLE\nHAVE TALKED ABOUT.

THAT WILL BE HIS CAMPAIGN FOCUS\nFROM HERE ON OUT. ALSO, GIVING SOME COMMENTS ON\nTHAT CONFERENCE CALL THAT INDICATED THAT HE WAS ASSUMING\nNOW THAT HILLARY CLINTON WOULD BE THE LIKELY NEXT PRESIDENT OF\nTHE UNITED STATES, AND THAT REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE NEED TO\nDEFEND AGAINST A HILLARY CLINTON AGENDA AS PRESIDENT.\nWE ALSO HAVE GOT SOME COMMENTS NOW FROM MIKE PENCE, THE VICE\nPRESIDENTIAL PICK FOR DONALD TRUMP, WHO HAS BEEN OUT ON THE\nCAMPAIGN TRAIL TODAY, JUST SAID LAST NIGHT MY RUNNING MATE\nSHOWED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHAT WAS IN HIS HEART, AND THEN HE\nFOUGHT BACK AND TURNED THE FOCUS.\nI'M PROUD TO STAND WITH DONALD TRUMP.\nTHAT COMING FROM THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL RUNNING MATE, MIKE\nPENCE. BACK OVER TO YOU.\n>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS AT\nWAR WITH ITSELF HERE. INTERNAL CIVIL WAR.\nBY THE WAY, WE HAVE THE RNC NEVADA CHAIRWOMAN COMING ON THE\nSHOW AND SHE SAYS SHE IS GOING TO TRY TO DRIVE A CAMPAIGN, IF\nYOU'RE NOT VOTING FOR DONALD TRUMP, WE'RE NOT VOTING FOR YOU.\nIT IS GETTING REALLY UGLY AS THEY START TO FOCUS ON WHAT IS\nGOING ON DOWN BALLOT. >> BACK IN 1996, THE REPUBLICANS\nIN CONGRESS, DURING THE DOLE AND CLINTON ELECTION GOT TO THE SAME\nPOINT, ROUGHLY THE SAME JUNCTURE IN THE ELECTION.\nFOUR WEEKS OUT. AND THEY REALIZED MR. DOLE WAS\nNOT GOING TO WIN. AND SO THEY CAME AND DID WHAT\nMR. RYAN BASICALLY SAID, FOCUS ON -- I FORGET WHO THE SPEAKER\nWAS AT THE TIME, GINGRICH. >> HOW COULD YOU?\n>> THAT THEY WERE GOING TO FOCUS ON THE CONGRESSIONAL RACES TO\nHOLD ON TO THE HOUSE AT THAT TIME.\nIT WAS BASICALLY A CONCESSION THAT THEY REALIZED THAT MR. DOLE\nWASN'T GOING TO WIN. I'M NOT SURE THAT'S TRUE THIS\nTIME, BUT WHO KNOWS.

THIS POLL IS DONE ON SATURDAY\nAND SUNDAY BEFORE THE DEBATE LAST NIGHT.\nIN A FOUR-WAY RACE, CLINTON IS LEADING TRUMP BY 11 POINTS AMONG\nLIKELY VOTERS. THE LEAD INCREASES TO 14 POINTS\nIN A TWO-WAY MATCH. MEANWHILE, WALL STREET IS\nBETTING ON A CLINTON WIN, PREDICTED, THIS IS A REAL MONEY\nPOLITICAL PREDICTION MARKET, HAS CLINTON AT 84 CENTS AND TRUMP AT\n22 CENTS. IT WILL COST YOU 22 CENTS TO BET\nTHAT DONALD TRUMP WILL WIN. IF HE DOES, YOU GET A DOLLAR.\nTHAT'S HOW THAT WORKS. JOINING US IS TONY FRATO.\nTONY, TONY, TONY. IS IT SAFE TO SAY YOU'RE STILL\nNEVER TRUMP IN THE WAKE OF THAT TAPE?\n>> I THINK SO. I THINK MORE PEOPLE ARE BECOMING\nNEVER TRUMP TOO, ACTUALLY. I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE PARTY\nIS FINDING ITSELF NOW, A TOUGH WEEKEND.\n>> TELL ME THE IMPLICATIONS OF PAUL RYAN AND WHAT HE SAID TODAY\nTHAT HE'S NOT GOING TO CAMPAIGN WITH TRUMP OR FOR TRUMP AND\nTALKING ABOUT THE DOWN BALLOT. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN LOGISTICALLY\nON THE GROUND, WHEN IT COMES TO GET OUT THE VOTE.\n>> I THINK WHAT YOU WOULD SEE IN A TYPICAL PRESIDENTIAL RACE AT\nTHIS POINT IS YOU WOULD -- YOU WOULD SEE PEOPLE OUT LOOKING FOR\nOPPORTUNITIES AND MOST DISTRICTS AND MOST STATES THE CAMPAIGN\nWITH THE PARTY STANDARD BEARER AND TO TRY TO BRING, YOU KNOW,\nBRING THOSE VOTES TOGETHER AND UNIFY.\nAND THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE SEEING NOW.\nYOU'RE GOING TO SEE A LOT OF MEMBERS LOOKING TO DISTANCE\nTHEMSELVES. THEY REALIZE THAT, YEAH, I\nLIKENED IT TO SORT OF YOU BOUGHT A TICKET ON A RUNAWAY TRAIN, YOU\nCAN'T GET OFF THE TRAIN, BUT YOU CAN TRY TO FIND SOME SAFE PLACES\nON THE TRAIN WHERE YOU CAN TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.\nI THINK THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF MEMBERS ARE DOING NOW.\nFOCUS ON THE DISTRICT, FOCUS ON YOUR STATE, FOCUS ON LOCAL\nISSUES, AND GO OUT AND RUN YOUR RACE AND TRY TO HOLD YOUR -- WIN\nYOUR SEAT. >> SO ALL THOSE REPUBLICANS\nWITHDRAWING THEIR ENDORSEMENT OF DONALD TRUMP, THEY'RE NOT\nENDORSING HILLARY CLINTON. DOES THAT MATTER?\n>> NO. I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO\nDISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE AS MUCH AS\nPOSSIBLE. SOME OF THEM ARE GOING TO SAY\nTHEY'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR, YOU KNOW, MIKE PENCE OR WRITE IN\nSOMEONE ELSE OR JUST NOT GOING TO VOTE IN THE PRESIDENTIAL\nRACE. THEY HAVE GOT OTHER PROBLEMS TO\nWORRY ABOUT, THOUGH, TO BE FAIR TO THEM.\nTHEY'RE IN A TOUGH PLACE IF YOU'RE KELLY AYOTTE IN NEW\nHAMPSHIRE OR SOME OF THE OTHER TOOMEY OR SOME OTHERS IN THE\nREAL TOUGH BATTLEGROUND STATES. YOU DO HAVE A PORTION OF YOUR\nREPUBLICAN ELECTORATE WHO ARE TRUE TRUMP SUPPORTERS AND SO YOU\nNEED TO FIND A WAY TO MOLLIFY THEM BECAUSE YOU NEED THEIR\nSUPPORT IF THEY'RE GOING TO COME OUT AND VOTE.\n>> DOES THE POLLING OF ENDORSEMENTS IN YOUR VIEW CHANGE\nANYBODY'S VOTE? I COULD SEE SOME ARGUMENT, I\nSUPPOSE, WHERE PEOPLE WHO ARE CORE TRUMP SUPPORTERS WOULD SAY,\nHEY, THESE ARE THE ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS WHOM WE WANT TO GET\nAWAY FROM AS FAST AS WE CAN. SO DOES -- IS THERE A CURIOUS\nWAY THAT THIS HARDENS HIS CORE SUPPORTERS?\n>> YEAH, HERE IS THE THING, TYLER, FOR A REPUBLICAN TO WIN\nTHE PRESIDENTIAL RACE, IN THESE BATTLEGROUND STATES, IF THERE IS\nA DETERIORATION OF TWO OR THREE OR FOUR PERCENT ON THE\nREPUBLICAN SIDE, IT IS A LANDSLIDE FOR THE OPPOSITION.\nTHESE RACES ARE FAR TOO CLOSE TO HAVE ANY DETERIORATION AT ALL.\nEVEN IF YOU -- WE WOULD SAY -- THE LACK OF ENDORSEMENT ISN'T\nGOING TO MAKE A BIG DEAL FOR A COUPLE OF THESE CANDIDATES, BUT\nA LITTLE DEAL, YOU KNOW, A SMALL DETERIORATION HAS A PRETTY BIG\nIMPACT IN THEIR RACE. SO IT REALLY DOES MATTER.\n>> TONY, SORRY TO JUMP, WE GOT TO GO.\nTHE TWEET CAME OUT FROM A NATIONAL CAMPAIGN SPOKESWOMAN\nFOR TRUMP, LIKE TWO MINUTES AGO, I CAN'T KEEP MY PHONE CHARGED\nDUE TO THE MASS VOLUME OF TEXTS FROM PEOPLE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY\nWHO WILL VOTE TRUMP BUT NOT VOTE DOWN BALLOT.\nFROM KATRINA PIERSON. SO BASICALLY THAT'S A THREAT, IS\nIT NOT? DOES A TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAVE ANY\nLEVERAGE AGAINST A GOP? THAT'S A THREAT.\n>> NOT A LOT. >> IS TRUMP THREATENING THE GOP?\n>> HE HAS THREATENED THE GOP, HE HAS THREATENED -- THREATS ARE\nSORT OF HIS MODUS OPERANDI. WE'LL SEE A LOT MORE OF THAT.\nBUT, YEAH, I EXPECT -- I EXPECT THERE TO BE SOME LOSS FROM SOME\nOF THE MEMBERS WHO CANNOT STAND WITH DONALD TRUMP, BUT THEY'RE\nGOING TO LOSE EITHER WAY, IF THEY STAND WITH DONALD TRUMP,\nTHEY'RE GOING TO LOSE SUPPORT. THEY NEED TO GAUGE IN THEIR\nSTATE AND THEIR DISTRICT WHAT IS THE BIGGER -- WHERE ARE THE\nBIGGER LOSSES GOING TO COME FROM AND THEN THEIR CONSCIENCE.\nIF THEY DON'T LIKE THIS GUY, THEY DISAGREE WITH HIM, THEY --\nTHEY FIND HIM OFFENSIVE, CAN'T STAND WITH HIM.\n>> TONY, THANKS FOR JOINING US. TONY FRATTO.\nLET'S BRING IN DIANA OLICK WHO IS GOING TO DISAGREE I THINK\nPRETTY HEARTILY WITH TONY. YOU SAID YOU'RE NOT VOTING FOR\nANY REPUBLICAN THAT IS -- >> THAT'S CORRECT.\nWE HAD PART OF OUR NEVADA DELEGATION WHO IS RUNNING\nWITHDRAW THEIR ENDORSEMENT FOR TRUMP AND I AM GOING ON THE\nRECORD AND WITHDRAWING MY SUPPORT FOR THEM.\nLET THE CHIPS FALL WHERE THEY MAY.\n>> SO THIS IS CIVIL WAR IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\n>> IT IS. IT IS.\nWE HAVE BEEN ADMONISHED ALL OUR LIVE AS REPUBLICANS, ESPECIALLY\nGOING INTO A GENERAL ELECTION THAT YOU GET ON BOARD, YOU VOTE\nFOR ALL THE REPUBLICANS UP AND DOWN THE TICKET, YOU GET AS MANY\nREPUBLICANS AS YOU CAN IN OFFICE.\nAND NOW WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THEIR FEET TO THE FIRE WITH THAT\nVERY SAME ADVICE TO THEM, WHY ARE THEY NOT SUPPORTING THE\nNOMINEE WHO IS HEAVILY SUPPORTED AND NOMINATED AT THE NATIONAL\nCONVENTION? >> BECAUSE OF THE TAPE ON FRIDAY\nNIGHT. YOU'RE NOT UPSET ABOUT THE\nFRIDAY NIGHT TAPE RELEASE? >> WE HAVE FAR MORE IMPORTANT\nTHINGS TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT RATHER THAN SOME BOY TALK THAT\nTHESE GUYS HAD 11 YEARS AGO. THEY NEED TO GET REAL.\n>> SO WHAT HAPPENS THEN -- ARE YOU WILLING TO DO THIS AND THEN\nPERHAPS CAUSE A LOSS OF SEATS AS A RESULT?\nI MEAN, IT SOUNDS LIKE -- >> ABSOLUTELY.\nIF WE DON'T HAVE TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE, NOTHING ELSE\nMATTERS. I'M GOING ON THE RECORD TO SAY\nTHAT IF TRUMP DOES NOT WIN THE WHITE HOUSE, I'M RESIGNING MY\nSEAT AS NATIONAL COMMITTEE WOMAN FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN\nNEVADA. WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE AT\nTHAT POINT AS HILLARY WOULD SAY? >> SO WHY ARE YOU SO CONVINCED\nTHAT HAVING A REPUBLICAN IN THE EXECUTIVE OFFICE MATTERS SO MUCH\nRELATIVE TO GETTING POLICY DONE? NOT ENOUGH TO HAVE A STRONG\nENOUGH OPPOSITION IN THE HOUSE OR THE SENATE TO STOP WHAT\nHILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO DO? >> YOU KNOW, WE HAD A REPUBLICAN\nMAJORITY IN THE SENATE NOW SINCE 2012.\nWE HAD A HOUSE MAJORITY SINCE 2010.\nAND WHAT HAVE THEY ACCOMPLISHED? YOU DON'T GET ANYTHING\nACCOMPLISHED WITH A DEMOCRAT IN THE WHITE HOUSE.\nWE NEED A REPUBLICAN IN THE WHITE HOUSE.\nAND THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN UNLESS WE GET EVERYBODY\nSUPPORTING DONALD TRUMP. HE'S GOT SOME GREAT IDEAS FOR\nTHE COUNTRY. HE'S GOT HUGE SUPPORT.\nNOT ONLY AMONG THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND HIS SUPPORTERS, BUT\nACROSS PARTY LINES. >> QUICK QUESTION, IF I MIGHT,\nDIANA. WERE YOU ALWAYS A TRUMP\nSUPPORTER, TRUMP SUPPORTER FROM THE MOMENT HE ANNOUNCED OR DID\nYOU CHANGE AS HE BECAME THE APPARENT NOMINEE, THAT'S NUMBER\nONE. NUMBER TWO, HOW IS IT LOOKING IN\nYOUR STATE? >> WELL, I -- I WAS ORIGINALLY A\nRAND PAUL SUPPORTER. BUT AFTER SEEING DONALD TRUMP IN\nTHE VERY FIRST DEBATE IN AUGUST OF 2015, I REALIZED THAT THIS\nMAN WAS GOING TO BE RUNNING ONE HECK OF A GOOD RACE, AND HAD A\nLOT -- A LOT THAT WAS SO MUCH DIFFERENT IN HIS MESSAGING TO\nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND I WENT ON RECORD SUPPORTING\nHIM FOR PRESIDENT IN SEPTEMBER OF 2015.\nIN THE STATE WE HAVE HUGE SUPPORT FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nWE HAVE A HUGE GROUND GAME. VERY POSITIVE.\nI DON'T AGREE WITH A LOT OF WHAT THE POLLS ARE SHOWING BECAUSE I\nDON'T THINK THEY'RE ACTUALLY POLLING THE EVERYDAY\nGROUNDSWELL, THE GRASSROOTS. >> RIGHT.\nTHAT WAS SOMETHING WE JUST TALKED ABOUT -- WE JUST TALKED\nABOUT THAT VERY IDEA, A FEW MOMENTS AGO, WITH PROFESSOR\nSABATO . THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nWE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. >> YOU'RE WELCOME.\n>> IT IS THE SMALL CAP CALL OF THE DAY.\nTHIS STOCK HAS SURGED 200% THIS YEAR AND SOME EXPECT IT TO RALLY\n30% FROM HERE. THAT AND THREE OTHER BIG CALLS\nIN STREET TALK NEXT.",

STICK AROUND.\nCONTINUING NOW FROM ST. LOUIS. THE SCENE OF WHAT TURNED OUT TO\nBE A VERY RAUCOUS, THE MOST RAUCOUS PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE WE\nHAVE SEEN IN QUITE SOME TIME. THE FALLOUT FROM WHAT HAPPENED\nAT THIS IDYLLIC CAMPUS, NEXT. >> I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT ENGAGE\nIN THAT KIND OF BANTER BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS DIRKS I\nCALLED THAT LOCKER ROOM.

IT'S WITH HIM.\nAND WITH THE HATEFUL AND DIVISIVE CAMPAIGN HE HAS RUN.\n>> WE HAVE A DIVIDED NATION BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE HER.\nBELIEVE ME, SHE HAS TREMENDOUS HATE IN HER HEART.\nAND WHEN SHE SAID DEPLORABLES, SHE MEANT IT.\nAND WHEN SHE SAID IRREDEEMABLE -- THEY ARE\nIRREDEEMABLE -- YOU DIDN'T MENTION THAT.\nBUT WHEN SHE SAID THAT, TO ME THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN EVEN WORSE.\n>> BOXING REFERENCE.

I THINK THAT HIS SUPPORTERS\nREALLY WANTED TO SEE HIM STICK IT TO HER.\nIN THE PRIMARY, HE WOULD SAY, DURING THOSE DEBATES, I AM THE\nONE WHO CAN TAKE IT TO HILLARY CLINTON.\nI WILL BE THE ONE THAT STANDS UP TO HER.\nI WILL CALL HER THE DEVIL AND SAY SHE HAS HATE IN HER HEART.\nAGAIN, WINNING THAT PRIMARY OVER AND OVER AGAIN.\nI JUST DON'T KNOW IF THAT GETS YOU TO THE NEXT STEP.\nIN FACT, I'M SURE IT DOESN'T. >> WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S\nINTERESTING, WHEN THIS IS OCCURRING HOW SHE JUST SMILES.\nI THINK IT WAS LIKE -- HERE IS ANOTHER SPORTS MET FOR.\nSHE WAS SO FAR AHEAD, SHE HELD ON TO THE BALL AND JUST WAS\nHOPING TO RUN OUT THE CLOCK. IF SHE DIDN'T WIN, IT DIDN'T\nMATTER. SHE KNEW AT THE END OF THE\nDAY -- I SAID END OF THE DAY. SORRY.\nSHE WOULD BE SO FAR AHEAD IT DIDN'T MATTER.\nSHE KIND OF LET HIM GO AND JUST WAITED IT OUT.\nWHEN I LOOK AT THIS -- THIS IS TEAM SPORT POLITICS AT ITS\nWORST. IF YOU WERE -- IF TRUMP WERE A\nDEM, WE WOULD GO AT HIM LIKE CRAZY.\nIF SHE WERE A REPUBLICAN, THE DEMS WOULD GO AFTER HER.\nTHEY BOTH HAVE SERIOUS FLAWS THAT BOTH SIDES WOULD CONDEMN.\nTHEY HAPPEN TO BE ON YOUR SIDE.

YESTERDAY WHEN HE HAD THE\nPRE-DEBATE MEETING WITH THE FOUR WOMEN WHO CHARGED SEXUAL\nMISBEHAVIOR ON THE PART OF BILL CLINTON, I'M TELLING YOU -- THEN\nTHE CHAIR OF THE PARTY HAD TO STOP TRUMP FROM PUTTING THOSE\nFOUR WOMEN IN THE FAMILY SEATING SECTION.\nTHAT -- >> LET'S BE ACCURATE.\n>> I THOUGHT IT WAS FAMILY SEATING.\n>> HILLARY HAD SENATOR MccKASKE IN THERE.\n>> YOU HAVE REPUBLICANS HERE IN AN INTRAMURAL MOMENT.\nWHAT WE SEE GOING ON IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT DANA IS\nTALKING ABOUT SAYING, I CAN'T BACK THIS GUY.\n>> BILL O'REILLY SAID IT THIS MORNING.\nTHIS IS A LOT OF REPUBLICANS WHO STICK THEIR -- WET THEIR FINGER\nAND FIGURE OUT WHICH DIRECTION THE WIND IS BLOWING AND THEY\nWILL BE BEHIND HIM IF IT'S BLOWING IN HIS DIRECTION AND\nFALL OUT -- >> I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE\nCASE. I THINK THAT'S WRONG.\nTHERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE STICKING TO PRINCIPLES THAT\nWERE IDEOLOGICAL CONSERVATIVES WHO SAID THIS GUY WAS NOT FOR US\nAND BECAUSE -- THEY ARE NOT FAIR WEATHER FRIENDS.\nKASICH, HE NEVER WENT THERE. THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT\nDIDN'T GO THERE. >> THOSE ARE PEOPLE WHO NEVER\nGOT IN LINE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PEOPLE\nWHO WERE IN LINE AND -- >> YOU WERE TELLING HIM, GET\nBEHIND. YOU BETTER GET IN LINE NOW.\nYOU BETTER GET IN LINE. NOW THEY'RE LEAVING.\n>> I HONESTLY THINK THAT IF YOU WANT A GOP IN THE WHITE HOUSE,\nYOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GET BEHIND HIM.\nYOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO. ABORTION WILL COME TO THE\nSUPREME COURT LEVEL IN THE NEXT FOUR, EIGHT YEARS.\nGUN LAWS ARE GOING TO COME UP AT THE SUPREME COURT LEVEL.\nIMMIGRATION WILL COME TO THE SUPREME COURT IF YOU HAVE\nHILLARY CLINTON, WE KNOW, THE LIST OF DONALD TRUMP SUPREME\nCOURT NOMINEES IS CONSERVATIVE. >> WE SHOULD HAVE NOMINATED AN\nELECTABLE CANDIDATE. >> IT'S TOO LATE.\n>> YOU ARE RIGHT. IT'S TOO LATE.\nHILLARY IS PRESIDENT. >> YOU WANT TO WEIGH IN ON THIS?\n>> I THINK PEOPLE LIKE PAUL RYAN AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS BEFORE HE\nGOT SUPER INVOLVED IN MAKING COMMENTS ABOUT THIS RACE, MITT\nROMNEY, IT'S NOT THEIR STYLE. THEY'RE NOT THE CANDIDATE THAT\nDONALD TRUMP IS. I DON'T THINK THAT PAUL RYAN WAS\nEVER SUPER COMFORTABLE WITH THIS.\nHIS MESSAGE IS STRONG AND CLEAR. I'M GOING TO GO DO ALL THE\nEVENTS AND THE FUND-RAISING AND THE -- GO OUT TO MY CONSTITUENTS\nAND THE MESSAGE TO THE REST IS DO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO\nDISTRICT TO RETAIN YOUR SEAT OR WIN YOUR SEAT.\nTHAT'S A VERY SPECIFIC FOCUS MESSAGE.\nTRUMP, WHO IS HAPPY I THINK MANY TIMES TO KIND OF BE ON HIS OWN\nAND BEAT TO HIS OWN DRUM WILL DO WHAT HE DOES BEST.\nTO ME LAST NIGHT WAS NO SURPRISE.\nTHEY WERE HITTING HIM HARD. OBVIOUSLY, THOSE ARE CLINTON\nSUPPORTERS. MAYBE MORE TO COME.\nTHIS IS NOT SHOCKING TO ANYBODY. I NEVER EXPECTED HE WASN'T GOING\nTO GO OUT THERE LAST NIGHT AND TRY TO CRUSH IT AND PUNCH BACK\nHARD, BECAUSE HE WAS CRITICIZED WIDELY FOR NOT DOING SO.\nDANA MAKES A POINT, IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THIS IS WHAT HIS\nSUPPORTERS WANT. THERE HAVE BEEN PEOPLE WAITING\nFOR SOMEONE TO COME AND HIT HARD ON THE CLINTONS AND TALK ABOUT\nTHIS STUFF THAT ARE IN HIS GROUP.\nTHEY WERE LIKE, THAT'S WHAT WE WERE WAITING FOR.\nTHAT GROUP IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE ALL IN ON HIM, NO MATTER WHAT\nOTHER TAPES OR ANYTHING ELSE COMES OUT.\nI THINK THAT'S LIKE -- THEY ARE GLUED IN TO HIM, NOT JUST BAKED\nIN. >> YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS\nFOR ME? IS THAT THE CRITICISM OF HILLARY\nIS SO VALID. THE FACT THAT A FEMINIST SMEARED\nVICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT, IS UNBELIEVABLE.\nHER SIDE DOESN'T HOLD HER FEET TO THE FIRE ABOUT WHAT SHE DID\nTO THOSE WOMEN. THE PROBLEM ALSO IS TRUMP ISN'T\nTHE RIGHT MESSENGER FOR THAT. BECAUSE HE CALLED BILLED\nACCUSERS TERRIBLE, HE CALLED THEM UNATTRACTIVE.\nHE CALLED PAULA JONES A LOSER. NOW WE'RE SUPPOSED TO SAY, GOOD\nJOB. NOW THAT YOU ARE RUNNING --\n>> NO ONE SAYS GOOD JOB. NO ONE AT THIS TABLE HAS SAID\nGOOD JOB ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS HE HAS SAID.\nWHAT I'M SAYING -- MAYBE OTHER PEOPLE -- WHAT I'M SAYING IS,\nNOT GOOD JOB. NOT AS CONSERVATIVE AS YOU WOULD\nWANT. BUT THE ALTERNATIVE RIGHT NOW IS\nDEFINITELY WHAT WE DON'T WANT OR WHAT I WOULD NOT WANT FOR THE\nCOUNTRY. MY SON AND MY FAMILY.\n>> I WOULD ARGUE THAT IF HILLARY IS -- THE KEY IS TO HOLD ON TO\nTHE HOUSE AND SENATE AT THIS POINT.\nI DON'T SEE TRUMP WINNING. A COMPROMISE DAMAGED HILLARY\nCLINTON IS YOU CAN CONTROL. >> FAIR ENOUGH.\n>> ONE MORE. THIS TOPIC WAS BLOWING UP MY\nTWITTER FEED. THE DEBATE MODERATORS WERE\nWORKING AGAINST THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE, QUESTION MARK.\nDONALD TRUMP THOUGHT SO. >> SHE CAMPAIGNED WHERE THE --\n>> MR. TRUMP -- MR. TRUMP, I WANT TO GET TO AUDIENCE\nQUESTIONS AND ONLINE QUESTIONS. >> SHE'S ALLOWED TO DO THAT?\n>> YOU ARE GOING TO RESPOND RIGHT NOW.\n>> HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO ALLOW --\n>> WHY DID IT MORPH INTO THAT? ANSWER THE QUESTION.\nDO YOU STILL -- >> YOU INTERRUPT ME ALL THE\nTIME. WHY DON'T YOU INTERRUPT HER.\nWHY AREN'T YOU BRINGING UP THE E-MAILS?\nI WOULD LIKE TO KNOW. >> WE BROUGHT UP THE E-MAILS.\n>> IT HASN'T. IT HASN'T BEEN FINISHED.\n>> KIM HAS A QUESTION. >> IT'S NICE ONE ON THREE.\n>> AT SOME POINT IT WAS LITERALLY FOR ME LIKE THEY\nWERE -- THE MODERATORS WERE DEBATING TRUMP AND HILLARY\nCLINTON WAS -- I WAS SITTING BACK AND WITH A SMILE.\nTHAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN AT THE NEXT DEBATE ON THE 19th\nBECAUSE THAT MODERATOR IS FAIR AND BALANCED, FOX NEWS SUNDAY\nANCHOR CHRIS WALACE. >> WE SHOULD HAVE HIM JOIN US AS\nA GUEST. >> YOU POINTED OUT THIS MORNING\nWAS THIS RED LINE COMMENT THAT HILLARY SAYS SHE WASN'T\nSECRETARY OF STATE WHEN THE RED LINE WAS DRAWN.\nBUT SHE WAS, WASN'T SHE? >> A LITTLE BIT OF CONFUSION\nTHERE. I DON'T KNOW, A FOG OF WAR\nSITUATION. WAS I?\nWASN'T I? THERE WERE SO MANY MOVING PARTS,\nSO MUCH GOING ON. AFTER YOU GO THROUGH AND CAN\nANALYZE IT AND FIGURE OUT WHAT EXACTLY WAS SAID, WHAT MISTAKES\nWERE MADE, WHAT FACT CHECKPOINTS.\nIT WAS KIND OF SUPER PACKED IN, CHOCK FULL OF NUTS.\n>> WHERE WAS THE FACT CHECK ON THAT ONE?\n>> THERE WERE LOTS OF FACT CHECKING.\nTHE QUESTION WAS WHEN EXACTLY DID THE PRESIDENT MAKE THIS\nCOMMITMENT OR WHEN DID THE CONGRESS -- OKAY.\n>> 2012. >> IT DOESN'T -- WE DREW THE\nLINE IN 2012. >> I THINK THE FACT CHECKERS\nLAST NIGHT WERE ALL ABOUT PENCE. TRUMP THROUGH PENCE UNDER THE\nBUS. >> THAT'S A HARSH TERM.\n>> IT'S THE SAME ISSUE. BUT I THINK IT'S DIFFERENT WHEN\nYOU CAN SEE SOMETHING IN EXPLICIT TERMS.\nHE EVEN SAID -- I THINK TRUMP EVEN SAID THAT HE THOUGHT PUTIN\nAND IRAN WERE ABOUT DEFEATING ISIS.\nI'M LIKE, WHAT? >> CAN I BRING DANA IN HERE?\nMITT ROMNEY DIDN'T PUSH BACK ON CANDY CRAWLY WHEN SHE MADE THE\nCOMMENT ABOUT BENGHAZI. DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T PUSH BACK\nWHEN SHE SAID I WASN'T THERE. >> I THINK THAT THE TIMING\nJUST -- IN A DEBATE LIKE THAT, IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONFUSING.  WE KNOW SHE WAS THERE BECAUSE\nSHE WRITES ABOUT IT IN THE BOOK AND HOW SHE SAID HER POSITION\nWAS TO GO AHEAD AND BOMB ASSAD'S BASE AND THE AIRPLANE SO HE\nCOULD NOT DO THE THINGS HE ENDED UP DOING.\nSHE WAS WILLING TO LOOK AT ARMING THE REBELS.\nSHE ACTUALLY WRITES THAT IN HER BOOK.\nSHE'S NOT SUCCESSFUL IN AND PERSUASIVE.\nNEITHER WAS GATES OR THE NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM BECAUSE\nOBAMA AND BIDEN DECIDED TO GO THEIR OWN WAY.\nTHAT'S WHEN KERRY TOOK OVER. I DON'T THINK -- I THINK TRUMP\nWAS RIGHT NOT TO TOUCH THAT IN TERMS OF A TIMING PERSPECTIVE.\nIT WAS RIGHT ON THE LINE. >> YOU KNOW WHAT THE OTHER\nTHING, NOT MODERATORS BUT THE IDEA OF THE UNDECIDED.\nI DIDN'T SEE A LOT OF UNDECIDED PEOPLE THERE.\nDO YOU BELIEVE A PERSON IS UNDECIDED WHEN THEY BRING UP\nISLAMAPHOBIA TO DONALD TRUMP? DO YOU THINK THAT PERSON IS ON\nTHE FENCE? I DON'T THINK SO.\nI THINK THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF HAND PICKING GOING ON THERE.\n>> WE WILL LEAVE IT THERE.",

MOLLY, YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE\nPEOPLE WHO DESERTED HIM PARTICULARLY INCLUDING ROB\nPORTMAN OF OHIO? >> THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE TAPE\nDIFFERENT FROM EVERYTHING WE'VE KNOWN ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, SO THE\nEXODUS THAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS NOT BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SUDDENLY\nSURPRISED TO LEARN DONALD TRUMP IS WHO WE'VE ALWAYS KNOWN WHO HE\nIS, THEY'RE BAILING ON HIM IN LARGE PART BECAUSE HE'S DOING SO\nPOORLY ELECTORALLY. >> ISN'T WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW\nIN THE POLLING AVAILABLE TO US, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\" POLL,\nTHAT VIDEO WENT DOWN VERY BADLY WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE AND WHILE\nYOU MAY NOT HAVE BEEN SHOCKED AND MAYBE I WASN'T SHOCKED A LOT\nOF PEOPLE WERE SHOCKED. >> OH, IT ABSOLUTELY WENT OVER\nPOORLY WITH PEOPLE. I DON'T THINK PEOPLE WERE AWARE\nTHAT THEY HADN'T LISTENED TO HOWARD STERN'S AUDIO WHERE\nDONALD TRUMP SAID VERY SIMILAR THINGS.\nTHEY HADN'T READ THE BOOK WHERE HE BRAGS ABOUT BEDDING MARRIED\nWOMEN AND WHAT NOT. ALSO THERE'S SOMETHING OF A\nSELF-FULFILLING PROPHECY HERE. THE MEDIA ARE ABSOLUTELY\nAPOPLECTIC ABOUT THIS AND THAT CREATES A DYNAMIC THAT IS\nFEEDING INTO THESE POLLS. >> LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHO SOME\nOF THE MAIN FIGURES WERE WHO BAILED ON DONALD TRUMP OVER THE\nWEEK. I THINK WE CAN PUT IT UP ON THE\nSCREEN. THERE'S A SET OF ABOUT TEN OF\nTHEM.

WOULD IT HAVE BEEN WISER FOR\nTHEM TO DO WHAT PAUL RYAN DIDN'T DO AND MOVE AWAY FROM HIM\nQUIETLY, OR CAN YOU -- DO YOU HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING IN\nLIGHT -- >> I THINK THEY HAVE TO SAY\nSOMETHING AND THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT GETTING ELECTED OR\nRE-ELECTED AND THEY ASSUME, OF COURSE, THAT TRUMP IS NOT GOING\nTO WIN. IF THEY THOUGHT TRUMP WAS GOING\nTO WIN, THEY WOULDN'T BE OUT THERE PUTTING DISTANCE BETWEEN\nTHEMSELVES AND TRUMP, BUT THEY DON'T WANT HIM WHILE HE LOSES\nTHEY DON'T WANT HIM TO DRAG THEM DOWN.\nIT'S SELF-PRESERVATION AND IT'S NOT UNUSUAL.\n>> MOLLIE, IT'S BEEN TRUE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING WHAT'S SO\nTERRIFIED OFFICEHOLDERS AND MAINSTREAM REPUBLICANS ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP HE WOULD LOSE IN SUCH A LANDSLIDE THAT NOT ONLY\nWOULD THEY LOSE THE SENATE, WHICH WOULD BE TOUGH FOR THEM TO\nCARRY ANYWAY WITH THE LINEUP, BUT MIGHT LOSE THE HOUSE AS WELL\nWHERE THEY'VE HAD A VERY STRONG MARGIN OF MAJORITY OVER THERE.\n>> AND THAT IS A VERY LEGITIMATE CONCERN, ONE OF THE BEST\nARGUMENTS ABOUT WHY YOU WOULDN'T NOMINATE SOMEONE LIKE DONALD\nTRUMP.

IT'S HARD TO COMPARE THIS TO\nPREVIOUS YEARS IN THAT NOBODY REALLY THINKS DONALD TRUMP IS\nMUCH OF A REPUBLICAN AND HE DOESN'T SEEM THAT INTERESTED IN\nPRESENTING HIMSELF AS MUCH OF A REPUBLICAN.\nIT'S NOT COMMON YOU WILL SEE A SPLIT TICKET.\nIT'S A SMALL PERCENTAGE. IN THIS CASE IT MIGHT NOT BE AS\nBAD AS IT WOULD BE HISTORICALLY IF YOU SAW THE BOTTOM FALLING\nOUT OF THE CAMPAIGN AS WE SEEM TO BE SEEING THIS PAST WEEKEND.\n>> LET ME GET YOUR THOUGHTS VERY QUICKLY ON WHETHER YOU THINK HE\nDID HIMSELF ANY GOOD LAST NIGHT AND IF SO HOW MUCH.\nFRED? >> ABSOLUTELY.\nI THINK HE UNDER POLLS A POINT OR TWO AND MAY HAVE GOTTEN THREE\nOR FOUR POINTS. THIS BRINGS HIM UP DEPENDING ON\nYOUR PAUL, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\" POLL, SHOULD BRING UP\nUP TO FIVE OR SIX POINTS BEHIND.

A FOUR-WAY RACE A HALF POINT.\nMOLLY, YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE PEOPLE WHO DESERTED HIM\nPARTICULARLY INCLUDING ROB PORTMAN OF OHIO?\n>> THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE TAPE DIFFERENT FROM EVERYTHING WE'VE\nKNOWN ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, SO THE EXODUS THAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS\nNOT BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SUDDENLY SURPRISED TO LEARN DONALD TRUMP\nIS WHO WE'VE ALWAYS KNOWN WHO HE IS, THEY'RE BAILING ON HIM IN\nLARGE PART BECAUSE HE'S DOING SO POORLY ELECTORALLY.\n>> ISN'T WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW IN THE POLLING AVAILABLE TO US,\n\"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\" POLL, THAT VIDEO WENT DOWN VERY BADLY\nWITH A LOT OF PEOPLE AND WHILE YOU MAY NOT HAVE BEEN SHOCKED\nAND MAYBE I WASN'T SHOCKED A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE SHOCKED.\n>> OH, IT ABSOLUTELY WENT OVER POORLY WITH PEOPLE.\nI DON'T THINK PEOPLE WERE AWARE THAT THEY HADN'T LISTENED TO\nHOWARD STERN'S AUDIO WHERE DONALD TRUMP SAID VERY SIMILAR\nTHINGS. THEY HADN'T READ THE BOOK WHERE\nHE BRAGS ABOUT BEDDING MARRIED WOMEN AND WHAT NOT.\nALSO THERE'S SOMETHING OF A SELF-FULFILLING PROPHECY HERE.\nTHE MEDIA ARE ABSOLUTELY APOPLECTIC ABOUT THIS AND THAT\nCREATES A DYNAMIC THAT IS FEEDING INTO THESE POLLS.\n>> LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHO SOME OF THE MAIN FIGURES WERE WHO\nBAILED ON DONALD TRUMP OVER THE WEEK.\nI THINK WE CAN PUT IT UP ON THE SCREEN.\nTHERE'S A SET OF ABOUT TEN OF THEM.\nAND THAT DOESN'T REPRESENT -- THAT DOESN'T REPRESENT ANYTHING\nLIKE THE FULL COMPLEMENT BECAUSE THERE'S A WHOLE SLEW OF HOUSE\nMEMBERS WHO DID AS WELL. OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE HEADING FOR\nTHE EXITS BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID HE'LL DRAG THEM DOWN.\nWOULD IT HAVE BEEN WISER FOR THEM TO DO WHAT PAUL RYAN DIDN'T\nDO AND MOVE AWAY FROM HIM QUIETLY, OR CAN YOU -- DO YOU\nHAVE TO SAY SOMETHING IN LIGHT --\n>> I THINK THEY HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING AND THEY'RE WORRIED\nABOUT GETTING ELECTED OR RE-ELECTED AND THEY ASSUME, OF\nCOURSE, THAT TRUMP IS NOT GOING TO WIN.\nIF THEY THOUGHT TRUMP WAS GOING TO WIN, THEY WOULDN'T BE OUT\nTHERE PUTTING DISTANCE BETWEEN THEMSELVES AND TRUMP, BUT THEY\nDON'T WANT HIM WHILE HE LOSES THEY DON'T WANT HIM TO DRAG THEM\nDOWN. IT'S SELF-PRESERVATION AND IT'S\nNOT UNUSUAL. >> MOLLIE, IT'S BEEN TRUE FROM\nTHE VERY BEGINNING WHAT'S SO TERRIFIED OFFICEHOLDERS AND\nMAINSTREAM REPUBLICANS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP HE WOULD LOSE IN\nSUCH A LANDSLIDE THAT NOT ONLY WOULD THEY LOSE THE SENATE,\nWHICH WOULD BE TOUGH FOR THEM TO CARRY ANYWAY WITH THE LINEUP,\nBUT MIGHT LOSE THE HOUSE AS WELL WHERE THEY'VE HAD A VERY STRONG\nMARGIN OF MAJORITY OVER THERE. >> AND THAT IS A VERY LEGITIMATE\nCONCERN, ONE OF THE BEST ARGUMENTS ABOUT WHY YOU WOULDN'T\nNOMINATE SOMEONE LIKE DONALD TRUMP.\nUP UNTIL RECENTLY IT SEEMED PEOPLE WERE VIEWING DONALD TRUMP\nDIFFERENTLY THAN THEIR HOUSE AND SENATE CANDIDATES.\nIT'S HARD TO COMPARE THIS TO PREVIOUS YEARS IN THAT NOBODY\nREALLY THINKS DONALD TRUMP IS MUCH OF A REPUBLICAN AND HE\nDOESN'T SEEM THAT INTERESTED IN PRESENTING HIMSELF AS MUCH OF A\nREPUBLICAN. IT'S NOT COMMON YOU WILL SEE A\nSPLIT TICKET. IT'S A SMALL PERCENTAGE.\nIN THIS CASE IT MIGHT NOT BE AS BAD AS IT WOULD BE HISTORICALLY\nIF YOU SAW THE BOTTOM FALLING OUT OF THE CAMPAIGN AS WE SEEM\nTO BE SEEING THIS PAST WEEKEND. >> LET ME GET YOUR THOUGHTS VERY\nQUICKLY ON WHETHER YOU THINK HE DID HIMSELF ANY GOOD LAST NIGHT\nAND IF SO HOW MUCH. FRED?\n>> ABSOLUTELY. I THINK HE UNDER POLLS A POINT\nOR TWO AND MAY HAVE GOTTEN THREE OR FOUR POINTS.\nTHIS BRINGS HIM UP DEPENDING ON YOUR PAUL, \"THE WALL STREET\nJOURNAL\" POLL, SHOULD BRING UP UP TO FIVE OR SIX POINTS BEHIND.\nTHAT IS GOING TO BE HARD TO GET, THOUGH.\n>> THE LAST MONTH. MOLLIE?\n>> IT WAS HUGE. HE HAD A GOOD NIGHT AND IT WAS\nIMPORTANT FOR HIM TO DO THAT. IT JUST SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED IN\nTHE FIRST DEBATE NOT THE SECOND DEBATE.\n>> THANKS TO BOTH OF YOU.",

A WIN FOR HILLARY CLINTON AND\nDONALD TRUMP'S DISASTROUS DEBATE.\nBUT AFTER TRUMP DID WELL LAST NIGHT SUDDENLY NO ONE WANTS TO\nSAY WHO WON.

HE MAY HAVE DONE ENOUGH TO\nSTOP THE BLEEDING, AND I AM NOT SURE ANY MINDS WERE\nCHANGED. YEAH, WHEN THEY DON'T GO YOUR\nWAY THE DEBATES ARE KIND OF DUMB.\nTHE PRESS IS ALL IN FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHEY STOPPED PRETENDING A LONGTIME AGO.\nTRUMP CALLED THEM ON IT DURING THE DEBATE, BUT IT DIDN'T STOP\nTHEM. >> SHE CAMPAIGNED WHERE --\n>> MR.

YOU HAVE MARTHA CLEARLY\nTHROWING AWAY ANY IDEA OF OBJECTIVITY AND SCREAMING AT\nHIM. SHE WAS YELLING AT HIM LIKE\nSOMEBODY'S MOTHER SCREAMING AT PEOPLE IN THE BACKYARD.\nI DON'T KNOW WHY A MODERATOR WOULD JUST TOTALLY START\nSCREAMING AT ONE OF THE CANDIDATES LIKE THAT.\nIT SEEMS INSANE. >> I THINK SHE WAS TRYING\nTO -- I GUESS SHE WAS TRYING TO BE A REPORTER AND THE WE\nSHE GRILLS PEOPLE. >> HE WAS CRITICIZING\nSOMETHING THE MILITARY HAD DONE AND SHE SAID WELL THAT IS\nPSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE AND THIS IS WHY THEY DO THAT.\nWHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? YOU ARE ASKING A QUESTION.\nYOUR JOB IS NOT DEBATE THE CANDIDATE.\n>> DO YOU THINK IT WORKED? DO YOU THINK IT WAS GOOD HE\nFOUGHT BACK IN THAT WAY? >> HE HAS TO.\nPEOPLE ARE STARTING TO BE AWARE THAT THIS IS GOING ON.\nWHEN HE FIGHTS IT IS BETTER -- IT IS AS GOOD AS HIM POINTING\nIT OUT IF NOT BETTER. IT BECOMES OBVIOUSLY THIS\nCONTEST HE IS FIGHTING AND HE SPECIFICALLY SAYS NOW IT IS\nONE ON THREE. THE REASON PEOPLE QUESTION IS\nIT ONE ON THREE IS HE SAID IT.\nHE SAID THAT AND NOW IS THAT TRUE?\nLET'S DISCUSS IT. IF YOU DISCUSS IT YOU WILL\nHAVE 50% AT LEAST. >> THAT'S WHY HE BROUGHT THE\nFOUR CLINTON ACCUSERS. THEN IT WAS FOUR ON THREE.\n>> HE SAT THEM IN THE FRONT ROW AND HE HAD THOSE FOUR.\n>> DID YOU THINK THAT THAT WAS A GOOD MOVE?\nBRINGING THE CLINTON ACCUSERS.\nTHEY TRIED TO IGNORE IT. >> I THOUGHT IT WAS\nWONDERFUL. I DON'T WANT DEATH THREATS\nTONIGHT.

NOW THE CANDIDATES ARE YELLING\nBACK AT THE PRESS. WE TALK ABOUT HOW UNPOPULAR\nTRUMP AND HILLARY ARE. BUT THERE IS ONE ORGANIZATION\nTHAT IS MORE UNPOPULAR AND THAT'S THE MEDIA.\nBECAUSE OF THINGS LIKE THIS. ANDERSON COOPER SAID WE WILL\nLET THE AUDIENCE ASK THE QUESTIONS AND THEN YOU HAD THE\nWOMAN BARKING AT TRUMP LIKE A CRAZY PERSON.\nAND SHE IS YELLING AT HILLARY CLINTON TOO.\n>> HOW DO THEY STILL KEEP THE ILLUSION THAT THISY ARE\nSOMEHOW -- YOU HAVE ANDERSON COOPER AND THEY ARE PART OF\nWHAT YOU CALL THE MAINSTREAM PRESS.\nTHEY ACT AS IF THEY ARE OBJECTIVE.\n>> THEY DON'T ACT THAT WAY.

HE NEEDS TO BE ATTACKED FOR\nHIM TO BE 100% OF HIMSELF. HE MAY NOT HAVE DONE AS WELL.\n>> I THINK HE WAS -- >> TO BACK OFF IN THE FIRST\nDEBATE, IT IS NOT WHERE HE IS COMFORTABLE.\n>> HE LIKES TO BE IN A CORNER.\n>> WHEN YOU'RE A COCAINE ADDICT YOU LOVE THE ENERGY.\n>> I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW WHY THEY KEEP SAYING THAT.\n>> ANOTHER SIGN THAT UM FROM P WON THE DEBATE WAS THE MEDIA\nWANTS TO TALK ABOUT OTHER THINGS LIKE WHETHER TRUMP WAS\nMENACING LY STALKING HELL REWHEN IT WAS SHE WHO CROSSED\nIN FRONT OF HIM REPEATEDLY DURING THE DEBATE.\nI DON'T WANT TO BLAME THE VICTIM, BUT SHE WAS IN HIS\nSPACE. >> I MEAN, COME ON.\nWHAT WAS HE SUPPOSED TO DO, LEAVE THE STAGE?\nSHE IS WALKING AROUND AND THEN HE IS SKULKING AROUND BEHIND\nHER.

WHAT IN GOD'S NAME ARE THEY\nTALKING ABOUT? WHAT IS GOING ON.\n>> YOU HAVE TO HAVE RESPECT BECAUSE SHE HAS BEEN UNDER\nSNIPER FIRE AND SHE HAS PTSD. >> HE DIDN'T COMPLAIN ABOUT IT\nBY THE WAY. >> SHE DID.\nSHE COMPLAINED ON THE PLANE.

IF I GO TO THE BATHROOM ARE\nYOU GOING TO STEAL MY CHAIR? >> IS THAT AN INSIDE RADIO\nJOKE? >> PEOPLE WILL KNOW.\nI NO LONGER HAVE A RADIO SHOW ON THAT CHANNEL.\nI DON'T KNOW WHO DID IT. >> I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.\nSHE WASN'T ON IN THE MORNING. >> WHY IS HE A HERO?\n>> BECAUSE HE REMINDS AMERICA THIS IS WHERE HE COULD BE.\n>> WE ARE NOT ALL EVIL AND ANGRY AND RACIST.\nWE ARE UNCOORDINATED AND WEAR SILLY SWEATERS.\nIT IS EASIER. IT IS HAPPIER.\n>> ALL OF THESE UNDECIDED VOTERS WILL BE EXECUTED.\nTHAT'S THE TAKE AWAY FROM THE DEBATE.\n>> HE SAID HE WAS UNDECIDED LIKE A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE AND\nWE ARE WONDERING HOW THEY ARE UNDECIDED.\n>> ALL OF THEM WANTED TO BE ON TELEVISION.\nNONE ARE UNDECIDED. THEY ARE PROBABLY ALL\nCOMEDIANS AND TRYING TO START CAREERS.\nI WOULD HAVE DONE IT.

I HAD TO PUT MY GLASSES ON\nBECAUSE THE NO ONE RESPECTS WOMEN HOAR THAN ME.\nI NEEDED TO HEAR IT AGAIN, I NEEDED TO SEE IT.\nHE'S SPEAKING ABOUT THAT RECENTLY RELEASED TAPE BACK FROM\n2005, AND I WANT TO BRING IN MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR AND DAILY NEWS\nSPORTS COLUMNIST MIKE LUPICA, AND JAMIL SMITH.\nMIKE WINS HOME COURT ADVANTAGE, HE'S HERE.\nWHO WON? >> I'M NOT SURE WE CAN TALK\nABOUT WHO WON WHEN YOU HAVE A CANDIDATE WHO THREATENED TO JAIL\nHIS CANDIDATE, AND THE FACT THAT HE HAD BRAGGED ABOUT COMMITTING\nSEXUAL ASSAULT. WHETHER OR NOT HE ACTUALLY\nCOMMITTED THAT SEXUAL ASSAULT, HE WAS TRYING TO MAKE IT SOUND\nLIKE HE HAD DONE IT. LOOK, WE HAVE A CAMPAIGN THAT IS\nGOING DOWN IN FLAMES. RIGHT NOW, WE JUST SAW A DEBATE\nTHAT HE JUST BASICALLY RAN AROUND THE ROOM AND TRYING TO\nENGULF EVERYONE ELSE IN THOSE FLAMES.\nTHE USE OF WOMEN'S PAIN IN A PERVERSE STUNT, TRYING TO SEAT\nTHEM IN THE BOX, BILL CLINTON'S ACCUSERS IN BOX WITH THE FAMILY,\nIS JUST REALLY NOT EXACTLY SOMETHING YOU SHOULD BE SEEING\nFROM A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. >> MICHAEL, YOU'RE A SPORTS\nCOLUMNIST, I'M GOING TO GUESS YOU HAVE SPENT HOURS AND HOURS\nIN STINKY LOCKER ROOMS. ALL OR NOT DONALD TRUMP\nCOMMITTING THESE ACTS OR NOT, WALK ME THROUGH THIS.\n>> I HAVE SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE, MY WHOLE ADULT LIFE IN LOCKER\nROOMS. I NEVER HEARD ANYBODY SAY QUITE\nWHAT HE SAID TO BILLY BUSH ON THAT BUS.\nBY THE WAY, I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU WOULDN'T WANT YOUR\n10-YEAR-OLD TO WATCH THAT INSPIRATIONAL CIVICS LESSON.\nYOU KNOW, NOBODY WON LAST NIGHT. WE LOST.\nWE LOST, BECAUSE THIS IS THE QUALITY AND THE TONE AND THE\nTENOR OF THIS CAMPAIGN GOING FORWARD.\nFOUR WEEKS FROM NOW, WE'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE\nUNITED STATES, AND LAST NIGHT, LAST NIGHT, ONCE MR. TRUMP SAID\nBECAUSE YOU WOULD BE IN JAIL, I THOUGHT, OKAY, THAT'S THE MONEY\nQUOTE. NOTHING THAT ANYBODY WAS GOING\nTO SAY FOR THE REST OF THIS DEBATE WAS GOING TO BE MORE\nIMPORTANT THAN THAT. BECAUSE I THINK HE ACTUALLY\nBELIEVES THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE WAS\nINTERESTING, LISTENING TO THIS LAST NIGHT.\nWHEN MR. TRUMP WOULD SAY TO HILLARY CLINTON, WELL, WHY\nDIDN'T YOU CHANGE THE TAX LAWS? AS IF ONE UNITED STATES SENATOR\nHAS THE POWER TO DO THIS IN THIS COUNTRY.\nIT'S NOT THE WAY IT WORKS. >> JAMIL, WHEN YOU LOOKED AT\nLAST NIGHT, DID YOU THINK DONALD TRUMP DID ANYTHING MORE THAN\nFIRE UP HIS BASE OR HELD OFF SOME SENIOR GOP MEMBERS FROM\nEVACUATING? >> THAT'S SOMEBODY WHO REALLY IS\nONLY INTERESTED IN FIRING UP THE PEOPLE WHO COME TO HIS RALLIES\nAND HE THINKS MAYBE HE THINKS HE CAN WIN THE PRESIDENCY WITH\nTHEM. THE NUMBERS SHOW THAT HE CAN'T.\n>> I THINK WE LOST JAMIL. IS MIKE PENCE MAKING A MISTAKE\nHERE? IF HE STICKS WITH DONALD TRUMP,\nIF THIS THING GETS DIRTIER OVER THE NEXT 30 DAYS, DONALD TRUMP\nCOULD LOSE THE ELECTION, WALK AWAY, AND GO BACK TO BUILDING\nSKYSCRAPERS AND GOLF CLUBS. MIKE PENCE WANTS TO BE A PART OF\nREPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP FOR THE NEXT 20 YEARS.\n>> YEAH, IT WAS INTERESTING LISTENING TO YOUR INTERVIEW WITH\nHIM BECAUSE PENCE ACTED TODAY AS IF SOMETHING HAD CHANGED OVER\nTHE WEEKEND FROM EVERYBODY FINDING OUT ABOUT THE ACCESS\nHOLLYWOOD BUS TODAY. AND NOTHING HAD CHANGED.\nWHEN HE TALKED ABOUT GENUINE CONTRITION, I DIDN'T HEAR THAT\nLAST NIGHT. I REALLY DIDN'T HEAR IT IN THE\nTAPED APOLOGY ON FRIDAY NIGHT. SO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHAT\nHAPPENED THE OTHER DAY, AND WHAT'S INTERESTING IN THE MODERN\nWORLD IS, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT IT WAS CAUGHT ON TAPE.\nYOU KNOW, THERE'S A REASON WHY I SAY RAY RICE CAN'T GET A JOB IN\nFOOTBALL AND OTHER GUYS WHO HAVE COMMITTED SIMILAR OFFENSES, AND\nTHERE'S NO EQUIVALENCY -- >> WE HAVE SEEN IT.\n>> IT'S ON TAPE FOREVER. AND THOSE WORDS ARE GOING TO\nSTICK IN THIS CAMPAIGN. I THINK TRUMP DID A GOOD JOB\nLAST NIGHT BECAUSE OF HIS DEBATE PERFORMANCE AND BECAUSE OF HOW\nAGGRESSIVE HE WAS AND KIND OF LIKE A FIGHTER, WALKING AROUND\nTHE RING CONSTANTLY, THINKING IF YOU THROW ENOUGH WILD PUNCHES,\nYOU'RE GOING TO LAND SOME. HE MIGHT HAVE CHANGED THE\nSUBJECT SLIGHTLY, BUT THAT'S GOING TO BE PART OF THE\nNARRATIVE. THAT \"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD\" BUS\nWE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT IN A MONTH PROBABLY RAN HIM OVER.\n>> JAMIL, DO WE HAVE YOU BACK? >> YES, YOU DO.\n>> DID DONALD TRUMP BACK HIMSELF INTO A CORNER, WHETHER YOU TALK\nDONALD OR HIS SURROGATES, THEY KEEP TELLING US, THIS TAPE WAS\nFROM 11 YEARS AGO. WHAT HAPPENS IF MORE AND MORE\nCONTENT COMES OUT IN THE NEXT 30 DAYS?\nTHERE'S A LOT OF TAPE OUT THERE. I HAVE SEEN A LOT OF EPISODES OF\n\"THE APPRENTICE.\" >> THERE'S MORE THAN 60% OF\nPEOPLE WHO ALREADY THINK THAT DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T RESPECT\nWOMEN. YOU ONLY COULD EXPECT TO SEE\nTHAT NUMBER GO HIGHER. I THINK WHAT WE SEE HERE IS THAT\nYOU CANNOT BUILD A NATIONAL CAMPAIGN FOR THE PRESIDENT OR\nANY OFFICE, REALLY, BASED UPON THE GRIEVANCES OF, YOU KNOW,\nWHITE NATIONALIST PARTY. REALLY, WE'RE LOOKING AT A\nCAMPAIGN THAT IS GOING DOWN IN FLAMES.\nWHAT WE SAW LAST NIGHT IS, YOU KNOW, A PARTY THAT THINKS THAT\nTERRORISM IS A GREATER THREAT THAN SEXUAL ASSAULT.\nSEXUAL ASSAULT HAPPENS A LOT MORE OFTEN THAN TERRORIST\nATTACKS. IF YOU'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT\nMUSLIMS INFORMING ON THEIR NEIGHBORS.\nLET'S TALK ABOUT CHRISTIANS INFORMING ON PEOPLE LIKE DYLANN\nROOF. WE DIDN'T SEEM TO HEAR ANY\nCOMPLAINT ABOUT THAT. REALLY, IF YOU'RE GOING TO APPLY\nTHESE STANDARDS TO AMERICA, YOU KNOW, TALK ABOUT A VISION FOR\nTHE FUTURE, LET'S SEE IT APPLIED TO EVERYBODY.\nFRANKLY, DONALD TRUMP IS NOT PREPARED TO DO THAT.\n>> GENTLEMEN, WE'RE OUT OF TIME WRRK THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR\nJOINING ME THIS MORNING. >> WHEN WE COME BACK, LAST\nNIGHT'S DEBATE WAS EITHER EPIC OR AN EPIC DISASTER.\nWHAT DOES EACH CAMPAIGN SEE AS IT BEST MOMENTS FROM THE DEBATE.\nFIRST, YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO POST DEBATE.\nWE'RE GOING TO BE FACT CHECKING. KATIE SANDERS JOINS ME NOW.\nTHE FIRST TOPIC, HOW HILLARY CLINTON TREATED A CHILD RAPE\nVICTIM. >> ONE OF THE WOMEN WHO WAS A\nWONDERFUL WOMAN AT 12 YEARS OLD WAS RAPED.\nAT 12. HER CLIENT, SHE REPRESENTED, GOT\nHIM OFF, AND SHE'S SEEN LAUGHING ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS.\nLAUGHING AT THE GIRL WHO WAS RAPED.\n>> KATIE, I HAVE SEEN THE TRUMP AD ON THIS, AND IT'S BRUTAL.\nIS HE TELLING THE TRUTH? >> HIS WORDS ARE BRUTAL, BUT\nTHIS IS NOT ACCURATE. WE RATED HIS STATEMENT FALSE.\nTHERE IS NO AUDIO OF CLINTON LAUGHING AT THAT VICTIM.\nHE'S REFERENCING A RECORDING WHERE SHE DID CHUCKLE RECALLING\nTHE CASE, BUT IT WAS ABOUT OTHER ASPECTS.\n>> THERE YOU GO, SO DONALD TRUMP FACT CHECK, FIRST ONE, WRONG.\nWE'RE GOING TO HAVE MUCH MORE FACT CHECKING COMING UP ON\nMSNBC.

WE HAD ONE HILLARY CLINTON ON\nSTAGE LAST NIGHT AT THE DEBATE AND A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT HILLARY\nCLINTON ON STAGE TODAY IN DETROIT.\nTELL US THE DIFFERENCE ABOUT THOSE HILLARY CLINTONS.\n>> Reporter: HEY, JOHN, YEAH, IF YOU SAW LAST NIGHT THE HILLARY\nCLINTON WHO WAS DETERMINED TO COME ACROSS AS NOT RATTLED BY\nWHAT DONALD TRUMP HAD DONE AND WHO WAS SOBER AND CAREFUL IN\nTONE, A LITTLE BIT SUBDUED, YOU GOT THE ANGRIER, MORE IN YOUR\nFACE, HE SHOULD HAVE SPENT LAST NIGHT APOLOGIZING HILLARY\nCLINTON HERE TODAY ON STAGE. I THINK, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT,\nTHERE ARE SOME DEMOCRATS WHO WANTED TO SEE A LITTLE BIT MORE\nOF WHAT WE SAW TODAY IN DETROIT FROM HER ON THE DEBATE STAGE\nLAST NIGHT. BUT, I DO THINK THAT HER\nCAMPAIGN HAS BEEN VERY FOCUSED FROM, YOU KNOW, BASICALLY, FROM\nTHE POINT THAT THOSE WOMEN WALKED OUT WITH DONALD TRUMP IN\nTHE PRESS CONFERENCE TO THIS MORNING ON THE PLANE AND TO\nEVEN, YOU KNOW, AS JEN PALMIERI AND OTHERS WERE TALKING TO\nREPORTERS HERE IN DETROIT, THAT HILLARY CLINTON WAS NOT RATTLED\nBY WHAT HAPPENED. THEY WERE TRYING VERY\nAGGRESSIVELY TO SEND THAT MESSAGE.\nI THINK THERE WAS A POINT THIS MORNING WHEN THEY THOUGHT, OKAY,\nDONALD, IT'S CLEAR THAT THE CONSENSUS IS EMERGING THAT\nDONALD TRUMP DID STOP THE BLEEDING WITH THE SECOND HALF OF\nHIS DEBATE PERFORMANCE. BUT THEN, OF COURSE, PAUL RYAN\nCAME OUT, TALKED ABOUT THIS. SO THE CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN IS\nKIND OF BACK TO FEELING LIKE THEY'RE IN A GOOD PLACE IN THE\nNEWS CYCLE. >> RIGHT.\nSO -- RIGHT, SO THERE'S KIND OF TWO PIECES OF GOOD NEWS FOR THEM\nTODAY, RIGHT? ONE OF THEM IS ALL THE STUFF\nGOING ON WITH PAUL RYAN AND HIM SORT OF CUTTING TRUMP LOOSE,\nEVEN IF HE DIDN'T DISENDORSE HIM.\nTHE OTHER THING, OF COURSE, IS THE NBC/\"WALL STREET JOURNAL\"\nPOLL, WHICH PUTS TRUMP IN THE MID-30s.\nTHEY MUST BE FEELING PRETTY GOOD ABOUT THOSE TWO DEVELOPMENTS IN\nTHE WAKE OF THE DEBATE? >> Reporter: I THINK THAT\nTHERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. THERE WAS A PERIOD OF TIME\nBEFORE THIS TAPE CAME OUT WHEN THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN WAS\nENJOYING THEIR POST-DEBATE PUMP IN THE POLLS, AND WHEN YOU\nTALKED TO THEM PRIVATELY SAID, IF YOU TALK TO THEIR COMES TEAM,\nTHEY WOULD SAY, NOW WE HAVE TO SET EXPECTATIONS FOR ANOTHER\nDIP, ANOTHER CYCLE BEFORE ELECTION DAY WHERE IT SEEMS LIKE\nTRUMP IS GETTING IT BACK TOGETHER.\nI THINK IT'S CLEAR WITH THIS POLLING, THINGS ARE VERY CLOSELY\nMOVING IN THEIR DIRECTION, TO THE POINT WHERE I DON'T THINK\nTHEY FEEL LIKE THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN.\nOF COURSE, THERE IS ALWAYS A LEVEL OF RISK WHEN THE\nEXPECTATIONS AND THE GAP IN THE POLLING IS AS HIGH AS IT IS.\nI THINK, YOU KNOW, THEY BELIEVE THAT ONE SOURCE I TALKED TO\nTODAY BELIEVES THAT THAT GAP IS NOT GOING TO MATERIALIZE TO THAT\nDEGREE ON ELECTION DAY OR THAT'S NOT WHERE THEY EXPECTED TO LAND.\nBUT I DO THINK YOU WERE TALKING A LITTLE BIT EARLIER WITH LIZ\nSMITH ABOUT DOWN-BALLOT RACES. I THINK THEY ARE AT THE POINT\nWHERE THEY'RE GOING TO GET SOME PRESSURE POTENTIALLY FROM\nDEMOCRATS TO DO A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THEY'RE DOING TO HELP\nTHOSE CANDIDATES. I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO RESIST\nTHAT PRESSURE. I THINK THEY BELIEVE THE BEST\nTHING THEY CAN DO FOR THEIR DOWN-BALLOT CANDIDATES IS MOVE\nTHOSE NATIONAL NUMBERS AS FAR AWAY AS POSSIBLE AND TRY TO TURN\nIT INTO A WAVE. I THINK THEY MIGHT GET SOME\nPRESSURE TO ACT OTHERWISE. >> SO THERE'S TWO OTHER THINGS\nTHAT HAPPENED TODAY THAT I THINK THEY MIGHT FIND A LITTLE\nDAUNTING. ONE IS, HERE AT AMBRIDGE, DONALD\nTRUMP REALLY, LIKE, LAY HEAVILY INTO THE NOTION THAT HE'S GOING\nTO KEEP TALKING ABOUT CLINTON'S SEXUAL MISCONDUCT 20 YEARS AGO\nAND HILLARY CLINTON'S COMPLICITLY IN IT.\nAND THE WIKILEAKS, ANOTHER SET OF JOHN PODESTA E-MAILS GET\nDROPPED. WHICH OF THOSE TWO ARE THEY MORE\nCONCERNED ABOUT, HAVING TO BE FIGHTING ON THE SEXUAL FRONT, OR\nTHE POSSIBILITY OF SOME REAL SURPRISE IN THE E-MAIL DOCUMENT\nDUMPS? >> Reporter: I THINK THAT THE\nE-MAILS PROBABLY MAKE THEM MORE NERVOUS, WITH SIMPLY BECAUSE,\nYOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T CONTROL WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW.\nAND SO IT'S UNCLEAR, YOU KNOW, WHAT MIGHT BE COMING IN THOSE\nDOCUMENTS. I DO THINK THEY FEEL LIKE\nTHEY'VE GOTTEN SOME BACK UP FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND, YOU\nKNOW, THIS IDEA THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN TOLD BY THE\nINTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY THAT RUSSIAN HACKING IS BEHIND SOME\nOF THIS. SO THEY CAN TAKE SOME COMFORT IN\nTHAT. BUT I DO THINK THAT THAT IS\nPROBABLY THE MORE STRESSFUL THING.\nI THINK SHE HAS BEEN DEALING WITH BILL'S -- BILL CLINTON'S\nSEXUAL PAST FOR THE ENTIRETY OF HER TIME IN PUBLIC LIFE.\nAND I ALSO THINK THAT THEY FEEL LIKE IT GENERATED -- YOU SAW\nTHIS IN THE POLLING AROUND HER POPULARITY NUMBERS WHEN SHE WAS\nFIRST LADY, THAT WHEN THIS WAS AT THE FOREFRONT, PEOPLE WERE\nMORE SYMPATHETIC TO HER. AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT'S HOW\nIT'S GOING TO PLAY OUT, NECESSARILY, WITH HER AS THE\nPERSON ON THE TOP OF THE TICKET, BUT IT'S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE.\n>> ALL RIGHT. KASIE, YOU'RE GREAT.\nTHANK YOU FOR DOING THE SHOW TODAY.\nWE'LL HAVE YOU BACK REAL SOON. AND WE'LL ALSO HAVE ALL OF YOU\nBACK REAL SOON.",

              "text": ">>> WELCOME BACK TO \"HARDBALL.\"\nDONALD TRUMP SCORED POINTS LAST NIGHT AMONG HIS BASE OF\nSUPPORTERS, WHO CHEERED ON HIS ATTACKS AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON.\nWELL, BY THROWING OUT THE RED MEAT AND HAMMERING CLINTON,\nTRUMP ALSO, WELL, DID HE EXPAND THE POOL OF SUPPORT HE NEEDS TO\nWIN THE WHITE HOUSE? DID HE WIN THE MODERATE\nREPUBLICANS. CLINTON SEEMED UNPHASED BY\nTRUMP'S ATTACKS THE WHOLE NIGHTS, AND INTERRUPTIONS DIDN'T\nBOTHER HER, AND SHE NEVER TOOK THE BAIT WHEN HE TRIED TO BAIT\nHER, INSTEAD, CHOOSING TO IGNORE THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE, LAUGH AT\nHIM A LOT, AND FOR THE MOST PART, PIVOTING TO HER POSITIONS\nON THE ISSUES. LET'S WATCH HER TACTIC HERE.\n>> PLEASE ALLOW HER TO RESPOND. SHE DIDN'T TALK WHILE YOU\nTALKED. >> YES, THAT'S TRUE, I DIDN'T.\n>> BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOTHING TO SAY.\n>> I DIDN'T IN THE FIRST DEBATE, AND I'M GOING TO TRY NOT TO IN\nTHIS DEBATE, BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO GET TO THE QUESTIONS\nTHAT THE PEOPLE HAVE BROUGHT HERE TONIGHT TO TALK TO US\nABOUT. >> AND GET OFF THIS QUESTION.\n>> OKAY, DONALD. I KNOW YOU'RE INTO BIG DIVERSION\nTONIGHT, ANYTHING TO AVOID TALKING ABOUT YOUR CAMPAIGN AND\nTHE WAY IT'S EXPLODING AND THE WAY REPUBLICANS ARE LEAVING YOU,\nBUT -- >> LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS --\n>> ALLOW HER TO RESPOND. >> LET'S FOCUS ON THE ISSUES\nTHAT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT TONIGHT. LET'S GET TO THEIR QUESTIONS.\n>> ACCORDING TO A CNN/ORC OF DEBATE WATCHERS, HILLARY CLINTON\nWON THE DEBATE, BEATING TRUMP 57-34%.\nDID HE PICK UP NEW VOTERS? WIN OVER FEMALE SWING VOTERS IN\nPLACES LIKE THE PHILADELPHIA SUBURBS, OR DID HE JUST STOP THE\nBLEEDING OVER THE FALLOUT FROM HIS LEWD COMMENTS ABOUT HIS\nTREATMENT OF WOMEN? JOAN WALSH IS WITH \"THE NATION,\"\nAND ALSO AN MSNBC ANALYST. AND STEVE CORTEZ IS AN ADVISER\nTO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. I WANT TO START WITH STEVE ABOUT\nTHIS. BECAUSE I SORT OF AGREE WITH THE\nWAY THAT PHRASE, THAT LEADING QUESTION, WE OPENED, PHRASED IT.\nI THINK HE STOPPED THE BLEEDING. I THINK HE SHOWED HE WAS ALIVE\nAND A FIGHTER. ALL THE ROUGH LANGUAGE, AND I\nWOULD SAY BAD MANNERS, OF COURSE, CONTINUE.\nBUT I THOUGHT HE SHOWED HE WAS ALIVE AND NOT DEAD, THE MOST\nIMPORTANT THING HE HAD TO DO TONIGHT.\nI DON'T THINK HE PICKED UP MODERATES OR MOVED INTO THE\nCENTER POLITICALLY OR FOUND PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T LIKE HIM\nBEFORE ARE GOING TO LIKE HIM NOW.\nI THINK HE WAS DONALD TRUMP LAST NIGHT.\nYOUR THOUGHTS? >> WELL, I WOULD LIKE TO THINK,\nCHRIS, THAT HE DID BOTH, BUT THE FIRST, MOST IMPORTANT TASK WAS,\nYOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT, WAS TRIAGE.\nWE HAD TO STOP THE BLEEDING. WE HAD A BAD FRIDAY, A BAD\nSATURDAY. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, ON SUNDAY, HE\nSHOWED US THAT HE IS, INDEED, A FIGHTER.\nI KNOW YOU COMPLIMENTED HIM OR HE COMPLIMENTED HILLARY CLINTON\nON BEING A FIGHTER. HE SHOWS THAT HE IS A FIGHTER.\nHE GOT OFF THE MAT AND HE ROARED BACK TO LIFE.\nSO I THINK THAT'S NUMBER ONE, AS WE STOP THE BLEEDING.\nNUMBER TWO NOW IS, WE HAVE TO WIN OVER THOSE MODERATE VOTERS,\nTHOSE UNDECIDE VOTERS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.\nI THINK HE STARTED TO MAKE THAT CASE AND I THINK WHAT HE DID\nFORCEFULLY IS MAKE THE CASE THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS UNFIT TO BE\nTHE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nHE DID SO WITH HUMOR, HE DID SO WITH FORCE, AND WITH EXAMPLES.\nHE BROUGHT UP ALL THE THINGS HE DIDN'T BRING UP IN THE FIRST\nDEBATE THAT A LOT OF O SUPPORTERS LIKE US WANTED HIM\nTO. THINGS LIKE BENGHAZI, LIKE THE\nE-MAILS, LIKE THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nI THINK IT WAS A FORCEFUL INDICTMENT.\nHE DID STOP THE BLEEDING AND WE'LL MOVE FORWARD FROM HERE IN\nCONVINCING UNCONVINCED VOTERS. >> YOU KNOW, JOAN, I'VE BEEN\nFOLLOWING DEBATES FOREVER AND LIKE CERTAIN TACTICS AND\nSITUATIONS. HILLARY CLINTON WAS BRILLIANT\nLAST NIGHT, SHE DID EXACTLY WHAT SHE HAD TO DO, WHICH WAS NOT TO\nLOSE. AND SOMEONE BROUGHT UP THE NAME\nTED KENNEDY, I DON'T LIKE THE WAY IT WAS BROUGHT UP, BUT IT\nWAS BROUGHT UP. WHEN HE WAS RUNNING FOR THE\nSENATE AND UP AGAINST EDDIE McCORMACK AND SAID, IF YOUR NAME\nWAS EDWARD MOORE, YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE.\nONLY YOUR NAME KENNEDY GOT YOU HERE.\nANYONE ELSE WOULD HAVE ATTACKED BACK.\nTEDDY WAS TOLD, DON'T ATTACK BACK, THEY'LL FEEL FOR YOU,\nUNDERSTAND YOU'RE NOT ATTACKING BACK, AND YOU'LL WIN.\nHILLARY KNEW HE WAS GOING TO THROW THE KITCHEN SINK AT HER.\nAND HILLARY CLINTON NEVER -- I KNOW I SHOULDN'T TALK ABOUT A\nWOMAN'S APPEARANCE, BUT IT WAS SPECTACULAR LAST NIGHT.\nSHE LOOKED GREAT, SPOKE INCREDIBLY CONFIDENTLY.\nEVERYTHING ABOUT HER WAS POISED, EVERYTHING ABOUT HER WAS\nPRESIDENTIAL. AND SHE LAUGHED.\nCHURCHILL USED TO SAY, I LIKE PEOPLE WHO CAN GRIN WHEN THEY\nFIGHT. SHE GRINNED.\nSHE GRINNED LIKE DAVEY CROCKETT AT THIS GUY, LIKE A BEAR, YOU\nKNOW? SHE LAUGHED AT HIM!\nIT MUST HAVE DRIVEN TRUMP CRAZY. >> I'M SURE IT DID.\n>> I THINK IT WAS A SPECTACULAR PERFORMANCE BY HER, EVEN THOUGH\nTRUMP PROBABLY SAVED HIMSELF A COUPLE MORE WEEKS IN THIS\nCANDIDACY. YOUR THOUGHTS?\nTAKE OVER HERE. >> WELL, SURE.\nI THINK THAT RIGHT MOW, CHRIS, IT'S NOT REALLY ONLY A MATTER OF\nOUR OPINION, DID HE WIN, DID SHE WIN, DID HE STOP THE BLEEDING?\nYES, HE GOT A TOURNIQUET, BUT DIDN'T STOP THE BLEEDING.\nI THINK WE'VE GOT SOME EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE NOW THAT SHOWS WHO DID\nWHAT. HE NEEDED THE TO DO TWO THINGS.\nHE NEEDED TO BRING BACK SOME REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP,\nREPUBLICAN OFFICE HOLDERS, SOME OF THOSE CANDIDATES WHO FLED\nTHERE HIM. AND HE NEEDED TO BRING IN WOMEN,\nAS YOU AND STEVE, AND I THINK WE ALL AGREE, NEEDS TO DO THAT.\nHE DID NEITHER. WE KNOW TODAY, IT'S ONLY GOTTEN\nWORSE. PAUL RYAN CAME OUT AND SAID,\nIT'S EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF. I'M NOT GOING TO CAMPAIGN FOR\nHIM OR WITH HIM, AND YOU SHOULD ALL GO VOTE YOUR CONSCIENCE, AS\nTED CRUZ ONCE SAID. AND THAT CNN POLL YOU TALKED\nABOUT, THE EVEN MORE INTERESTING THING IS, MEN ACTUALLY THOUGHT\nHILLARY CLINTON WON BY ABOUT TEN POINTS.\nWOMEN THOUGHT SHE WON BY 34 POINTS.\nSO HE DID NOT CONVINCE WON, IN MY OPINION, MODERATE REPUBLICAN\nWOMEN, OUR CLASSIC WOMAN IN THE PHILADELPHIA SUBURBS WHO MIGHT\nHAVE BEEN ON THE FENCE. I DON'T THINK HE BROUGHT ANYONE\nTO HIS SIDE WITH THAT STALKING AROUND, STALKING HER, LOOKING\nMENACING BEHIND HER. AND HUMILIATING HER OR TRYING\nTO, BECAUSE HE DIDN'T DO IT, WITH HER HUSBAND -- WITH THESE\nWOMEN THAT HAVE MADE THESE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST HER HUSBAND.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS -- I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT.\n>> GO AHEAD. >> I WANT A COMMENT FROM STEVE.\nI COULD -- EVERY TIME -- IT'S ALMOST LIKE WHAT AL GORE DID.\nHE -- WHY IS TRUMP LINING UP BEHIND HER EVERY TIME SHE'S\nSPEAKING? IT SEEMS SOMETHING OUT OF THE DAVINCI CODE.\nI COULDN'T GET IT. WHY WAS HE THERE BEHIND HER?\n>> LOOK, YOU CAN PUT A CAMERA ANYWHERE YOU WANT AND GET THAT\nKIND OF ANGLE. >> BUT WATCH HIM, HE WALKS WITH\nHER. >> HE DOES, STEVE.\nHE DOES. >> I THINK YOU'RE TRYING TO READ\nTOO MUCH INTO THAT. >> DON'T YOU KNOW WHEN\nSOMEBODY'S STANDING BEHIND YOU. CAN'T YOU SENSE THE PRESENCE OF\nSOMEBODY BEHIND YOU. WHY WAS HE STANDING RIGHT BEHIND\nHER? IT'S A SIMPLE QUESTION.\nYOU SAY IT DIDN'T LOOK THAT WAY. WE'VE GOT PICTURES TO SHOW IT.\n>> MY POINT IS, LOOK, THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA HAS DONE THIS\nTHROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN TO US. >> HERE WE GO.\nONE THING I'M NOT IS THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA.\n>> -- THE MOST NEFARIOUS -- >> HE WAS STANDING BEHIND HER.\n>> I WOULD SAY THIS, REGARDING THE OFFICE HOLDERS, SPEAKER RYAN\nAND OTHER REPUBLICAN OFFICE HOLDERS, WHEN I WAS IN JUNIOR\nHIGH, MY FAVORITE BOOK WAS \"THE OUTSIDERS,\" AND WE ARE THE\nOUTSIDERS IN THIS POLITICAL MOVEMENT.\n>> THE NUMBERS SHOW THAT. >> WASHINGTON, D.C., THEY'RE THE\nSOCS AND THE HERO OF THAT GROUP ENDED UP BEING THE GREASERS.\nWORKING CLASS AMERICANS WHO HAVE NOT PARTICIPATED IN THIS VERY\nSLUGGISH ECONOMY, THEY ARE SICK AND TIRED OF A RIGGED CRONY\nCAPITALIST SYSTEM IN WASHINGTON, D.C. THAT EXISTS ONLY FOR ITS\nOWN BENEFIT. AND WHAT DONALD TRUMP DID\nYESTERDAY IS SHOW THOSE PEOPLE THAT HE IS A FIGHTER FOR THEM.\nAGAINST HILLARY CLINTON, AGAINST THE WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT --\n>> STEVE, I'VE GOT TO SAY, WHENEVER WE USE THE TERM WORKING\nCLASS, WE'VE GOT TO THROW IN THERE WHITE WORKING CLASS,\nBECAUSE THE BLACK AND LATINO AND ASIAN WORKING CLASS IS NOT\nSUPPORTING DONALD TRUMP. I'M NOT GOING TO SAY IT'S ABOUT\nRACE OR RACISM, BUT WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL WITH THAT MODIFIER,\nBECAUSE A LOT OF WORKING PEOPLE, A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE\nANGRY ABOUT THEIR TAXES OR THE COST OF LIVING OR THAT THEY\nHAVEN'T GOT AN RAISE IN A FEW YEARS, THOSE PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE\nWITH HER. THE WHITE PEOPLE TEND TO BE WITH\nHIM. AND WE NEED, WHEN THIS RACE IS\nOVER, TO TALK ABOUT WHY THIS WAS.\nI PERSONALLY THINK THIS RACE IS OVER HERE.\nWE'LL HAVE A LOT OF TIME TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE GOT SO BIFURCATED\nIN THIS COUNTRY THAT WE CAN'T USE THE TERM WORKING CLASS\nANYMORE. >> I'VE GOT END TO NOW.\nI'VE GOT TO ASK YOU BOTH. I LOVE FINAL QUESTIONS.\nSTEVE, YOU FIRST. WHY'D THEY SHAKE HANDS AT THE\nEND OF THE DEBATE, BUT NOT AT THE BEGINNING.\n>> I DON'T KNOW. >> JOAN, DO YOU HAVE A THEORY?\n>> I THINK TRUMP WANTED TO SHAKE HANDS AT THE END.\nI THINK HE THOUGHT HE HAD A GOOD CLOSE LAST NIGHT, AND I THINK HE\nCAME ON NOT SO GREAT, BUT AT THE END OF THIS SECOND DEBATE, HE\nKNEW HOW TO DEBATE A LOT BETTER. I THINK THAT'S WHY HE WAS\nFEELING BETTER ABOUT SHAKE HANDS.\n>> I AGREE. AND I WILL, I NEVER -- I DON'T\nTHINK I'VE EVER SAID ANYTHING NICE ABOUT HIM ON YOUR SHOW,\nCHRIS, BUT I WILL SAY, IF HE CAMPAIGNED LIKE THAT MAN WE SAW\nIN THE LAST MINUTE WHO GAVE HER CREDIT FOR HER STRENGTH, IF HE\nCOULD TREAT HER AS AN EQUAL AND CAMPAIGN EYE TO EYE WITH HER AND\nSAY, WE DISAGREE, HE WOULD BE RUNNING A MUCH BETTER CAMPAIGN\nAND IT WOULD BE A LOT CLOSER, BUT HE HASN'T.\nBUT THAT LAST MOMENT WAS IMPRESSIVE AND THE HAND SHAKE\nWAS ALL ABOUT CEMENTING THAT FEELING.\n>> JOAN, YOU'RE A FIGHTER. >> I AM.\nIT'S TRUE. >> EVERYBODY LIKES BEING A\nFIGHTER. >> STEVE'S A FIGHTER.\n>> THANK YOU SO MUCH, JOAN WALSH.\nA RARE MOMENT OF COMMON GROUND. EVEN STEVE IS SILENCED IN HIS\nFERVENCY. >> I'M NOT SILENCED.\nI THOUGHT WE WERE DONE.",

              "text": "BIT.\n>>> WE ARE JOINED THIS MORNING BY VETERAN POLITICAL\nSTRATEGISTS. GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH.\n>> GOOD MORNING. >> SARAH, I'D LOVE TO GET YOUR\nINSIGHT, YOUR ANALYSIS OF THE CALCULUS TO BASICALLY ENTER INTO\nTHIS NEW LEVEL OF RANCOR WHICH CLEARLY PLAYS TO TRUMP'S BASE,\nKNOWING WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT VOTERS WHO SEVERELY DISLIKE\nHILLARY CLINTON, DOES IT WORK? >> IT ONLY WORKS TO MOTIVATE THE\nPEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY SUPPORTING HIM, RIGHT NOW IS\nABOUT 40% OF THE COUNTRY, WHICH OF COURSE IS NOT ENOUGH TO GET\nELECTED PRESIDENT. I THOUGHT THAT WHAT DONALD TRUMP\nDID LAST NIGHT IN THE DEBATE WAS HE STEMMED THE BLEEDING, BUT HE\nDIDN'T ULTIMATELY GET HIMSELF OUT OF ICU.\nAND HIS CAMPAIGN IS ON LIFE SUPPORT.\nMANY PEOPLE HAVE ABANDONED IT. AND I DON'T SEE MUCH THAT\nCHANGED AFTER LAST NIGHT RELATIVE TO THE TRAJECTORY OF\nTHIS RACE. >> MORRIS, A LOT OF PEOPLE FELT\nHILLARY CLINTON WAS RESTRAINED LAST NIGHT IN HER PERFORMANCE.\nSHE COULD HAVE GONE AFTER HIM A LOT HARDER ABOUT THAT TAPE AND\nABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES THAT HE'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT.\nDO YOU THINK THAT WAS ON PURPOSE?\nAND IS IT EFFECTIVE? >> YEAH, I THINK SHE TOOK A\nMEASURED APPROACH. AS YOU KNOW, THIS IS A MARATHON,\nNOT A SPRINT. SHE DIDN'T NEED TO LAND A\nKNOCKOUT PUNCH. SHE NEEDED TO SUSTAIN AND\nCOLLECT SOME MOMENTUM. SHE DID A GOOD JOB, A DECENT\nJOB. BUT SO DID HE.\nI THINK WHAT SHE DID WAS TO REALLY STABILIZE HER POSITION.\nNOW SHE NEEDS TO EXPAND AND REALLY MOTIVATE HER BASE.\nTRUMP WAS SMART BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT HE HAD TO STABILIZE HIS\nBASE. SO THAT'S WHY HE WENT TO THE RED\nMEAT TO GET THESE GUYS FIRED UP. HILLARY NOW NEEDS TO PIVOT AND\nGO TO THE HEART OF THE MATTER AND REALLY FOCUS ON THOSE FIVE\nOR SIX STATES THAT ARE GOING TO REALLY MATTER AND GOING TO WIN.\nAND TALK TO WHITE EDUCATED VOTERS AND FEMALES.\nSO I THINK THEY BOTH DID WHAT THEY NEEDED TO DO.\nI THOUGHT IT WAS A DRAW, BUT CERTAINLY IT'S GOING TO BE A\nCLOSE RACE AS YOU HEARD ME SAY IN THE PAST THAT'S GOING TO COME\nDOWN TO THE WIRE. >> SO THE WAY YOU GUYS DESCRIBE\nIT SOUNDS LIKE TRIAGE, ALMOST, RIGHT?\nYOU'RE TREATING THE MOST SEVERE PATIENTS FIRST.\nSARA, DOESN'T THAT THEN ALLOW HIM THE NEXT FOUR WEEKS TO\nSOMEHOW PIVOT TO THE CONTRITION THAT SOME SAY HE NEEDED TO SHOW?\n>> WELL, I THINK IT DOES. YOU KNOW, THAT ASSUMES NOTHING\nELSE COMES OUT EITHER ON THE TAX FRONT OR WITH RESPECT TO OTHER\nTAPES OF HIM DISCUSSING WOMEN IN AN INAPPROPRIATE WAY.\nYOU KNOW, I THINK, FOR TRUMP HE HAS TO SORT OF JUST GET UP EVERY\nDAY AND HAVE THE BEST DAY HE POSSIBLY CAN.\nTHAT'S REALLY ALL YOU CAN DO WITH A MONTH LEFT TO GO.\nAND LIKE I SAID, HOPE NOTHING ELSE COMES OUT.\nYOU KNOW, THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT CONTRITION, AND I --\nYOU KNOW, MY FIRST REACTION WHEN I SAW THAT TAPE WAS HE NEEDS TO\nGO APOLOGIZE. BUT I THINK THE CHALLENGE FOR A\nLOT OF VOTERS RIGHT NOW IS THEY UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT HE REALLY\nNEEDS IS A CHANGE OF HEART. AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO\nMANUFACTURE THAT. AND HE CAN TRY.\nAND PERHAPS HE'LL GET THERE AND HE'LL CONVINCE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO\nKEEP THE RACE CLOSE. BUT THE EVENTS OF THE LAST THREE\nDAYS HAVE BEEN TRAGIC FOR HIS CANDIDACY AND FOR THE REPUBLICAN\nPARTY. >> AND WHAT'S SO STUNNING,\nMORRIS, IS HIS RESILIENCE AMONG HIS SUPPORTERS AND AMONG HIS\nBASE. AND WE JUST DON'T KNOW EXACTLY\nHOW BIG THAT IS AND HOW MANY WILL TURN OUT TO VOTE ON\nELECTION DAY. BUT WHAT IT TELLS YOU IS THAT\nTHERE'S A LOT OF FRUSTRATION WITH THE STATUS QUO, A LOT OF\nPEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO SEE INSIDER ESTABLISHMENT CANDIDATES\nWIN. SO EVEN IF CLINTON DOES MAINTAIN\nHER LEAD AND WIN THE ELECTION, THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF\nANGRY PEOPLE. HOW DOES SHE REACT TO THAT?\nAND WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY ARE WE LOOKING AT PAST WHEN SHE -- PAST\nHER INAUGURATION IF SHE DOES WIN?\n>> WELL, SHE HAS A HISTORY OF WORKING WITH REPUBLICANS.\nIT'S FUNNY, WHEN THE REPUBLICANS RUN AGAINST HER, THEY WON'T\nCOMPLIMENT HER, THEY WON'T SAY, BUT WHEN IT'S NOT AN ELECTION\nYEAR YOU'LL HEAR THEM SAY SHE'S ACTUALLY OKAY TO DEAL WITH, SHE\nKNOWS HOW TO CUT DEALS, SHE KNOWS HOW TO WORK WITH PEOPLE.\nYOU KNOW, IT IS A SENTIMENT AROUND THE WORLD THAT\nANTI-ESTABLISHMENT, I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU.\nLOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN LONDON WITH BREXIT, LOOK AT WHAT\nHAPPENED IN COLOMBIA WHERE THE GOVERNMENT CUT THE DEAL WITH\nFARK AND VOTERS REJECTED IT. THIS IS A WEIRD AND DIFFERENT\nTIME. SO I'M NOT COUNTING DONALD TRUMP\nOUT. I'M NOT COUNTING -- HE'S BEEN\nABLE TO TURN THE CORNER AND HAVE NINE OR TEN LIVES.\nTHIS IS A GUY THAT YOU CANNOT COUNT OUT.\nHE'S LIKE A VAMPIRE IN A LOT OF WAYS.\n>> I THINK IT'S A GOOD POINT. YOU KNOW, DONALD TRUMP HAS\nBOUNCED BACK BEFORE FROM THINGS THAT MANY TIMES PEOPLE HAVE SAID\nHOW COULD HE POSSIBLY, YOU KNOW, SUCCEED AFTER THESE STATEMENTS.\nTHE CHALLENGE IS THE ACCUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ALL THESE\nSTATEMENTS NOW 30 DAYS OUT JUST MEANS THERE JUST ISN'T MUCH TIME\nTO CHANGE PEOPLE'S PERCEPTIONS. AND THE TRAGEDY FOR THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN IS THAT THERE IS SO MUCH MATERIAL IN WHICH TO TALK\nABOUT HILLARY CLINTON AND HER FAILURES.\nJUST IN THIS LAST TWO YEARS ALONE WHETHER IT'S ON THE\nFOREIGN POLICY STAGE, WHETHER IT'S ALL OF HER E-MAILS.\nJUST LAST WEEK SHE SAYS ONE THING TO WALL STREET INSIDERS\nAND ANOTHER THING ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\nI MEAN, THIS CONFIRMS WHAT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT HER.\nTHEY DON'T WANT TO VOTE FOR HER. BUT SHE'S LIKELY GOING TO WIN\nBECAUSE OF HIS INABILITY TO PUT TOGETHER A CAMPAIGN THAT CAN BE\nSUCCESSFUL AND UNITE PEOPLE. >> I'M NOT FOR SURE THEY DON'T\nWANT TO VOTE FOR HER. I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE\nSHE'S BEEN ABLE TO GET SEPARATION, YOU LOOK AT THOSE\nBATTLEGROUND STATES, YOU LOOK AT HER TRACTION, SHE'S PICKING UP\nMOMENTUM WITH HER BASE, BUT ALSO WITH EDUCATED WHITE VOTERS WHICH\nWILL BE THE MOST IMPORTANT VOTING BLOCKS TO REALLY MAKE\nSEPARATION. >> SHE'S INCREDIBLY UNPOPULAR,\nAND SHE'S NOT TRUSTWORTHY. >> FIRST OF ALL, I DIDN'T\nINTERRUPT YOU. YOU'RE ACTING LIKE DONALD TRUMP\nNOW. LOOK, THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS\nSHE DOES HAVE A BASE THAT BELIEVES IN HER.\nSHE NEEDS TO MOTIVATE THAT BASE. AND AS YOU KNOW, DEMOCRATS\nSOMETIMES DON'T GO TO THE POLLS WHEN THEY THINK THINGS ARE TAKEN\nFOR GRANTED OR IF IT RAINS. THIS IS WHY I'M NOT COUNTING\nTHIS MAN OUT. WE NEED TO STAY VERY FOCUSED AND\nDRILL DOWN ON THOSE FIVE OR SIX STATES THAT ARE GOING TO MAKE A\nDIFFERENCE. >> ONE LAST THING, SARA.\nI MEAN, SO MUCH DISCUSSION LAST NIGHT AND THIS MORNING ABOUT A\nCANDIDATE WHO THREATENS TO PUT HIS OPPONENT IN JAIL IF HE WINS,\nIT'S THE COVER OF THE \"NEW YORK POST\" TODAY, CONWAY THIS MORNING\nSAYS IT WAS A QUIP. HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO KNOW\nWHAT'S A JOKE AND WHAT'S A SERIOUS PROPOSAL?\n>> YEAH, I THOUGHT THAT WAS NOT SMART.\nYOU KNOW, THIS IS THE KIND OF THING THAT HAPPENS IN THE\nUKRAINE AND OTHER PLACES AROUND THE WORLD.\nAND, YOU KNOW, WHILE HE MADE A JOKE OF IT, IT'S JUST NOT --\nAMERICA IS BETTER THAN THAT. WE DON'T JAIL OUR POLITICAL\nOPPONENTS BECAUSE WE DISAGREE WITH THEM OR WE FIND THEM\nUNTRUSTWORTHY. AND, YOU KNOW, WITH HIM HE SAYS\nA LOT OF THINGS IN HIS CAMPAIGN EVENTS THAT AREN'T JOKES AND YOU\nCAN'T NOW SAY IT IS A JOKE WHEN YOU'VE SAID IT MANY, MANY TIMES\nAND IT WASN'T MEANT TO BE FUNNY. SO I DON'T THINK THAT WORKS.\n>> WELL, SARA, THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT DONALD TRUMP\nALWAYS SAYS THINGS AND DOES ANOTHER.\nFOR EXAMPLE, HE TALKS ABOUT HE'S GOING TO BE SO GREAT FOR TRADE\nBUT MAKES ALL OF HIS CLOTHES OVERSEAS.\nHE TALKS ABOUT ANTI-DUMPING BUT THEN AGAIN USES CHINA STEEL.\nSO IF HE SAYS HE'S GOING TO TAKE AND PUT HILLARY CLINTON IN JAIL,\nI DON'T KNOW, I HAVE A TENDENCY TO BELIEVE HIM BECAUSE I THINK\nHE'S JUST THAT CRAZY. THAT'S WHY I THINK THE AMERICAN\nPEOPLE ARE STARTING TO PAY ATTENTION NOW TO THE ELECTION.\nTHERE'S BEEN HIGH NUMBERS WATCHING THESE DEBATES.\nI BELIEVE SHE'S GOING TO TURN THE CORNER.\nBUT AGAIN, SHE CANNOT TAKE THIS FOR GRANTED.\nTHIS WILL BE AN EXTREMELY CLOSE RACE BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP'S\nVOTERS ARE PASSIONATE. AND WHEN YOU HAVE PASSION,\nPEOPLE COME TO THE POLLS. YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE ON THE\nDEMOCRATIC SIDE WE'RE CONNECTING WITH OUR VOTERS, GETTING THEM\nOUT TO VOTE AND ULTIMATELY RUN THE RACE COMPLETELY AND\nHOPEFULLY WE'LL WIN IN NOVEMBER. >> MORRIS REID, SARA FAGEN,\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH, GUYS. APPRECIATE IT.\nSEE YOU SOON.",

I WOULD EXPECT EVERY SENATOR IN\nA TOUGH RACE TO DO THE SAME. WE SAW MANY OF THOSE OVER THE\nWEEKEND REPUDIATING DONALD TRUMP, CALLING FOR HIM TO QUIT\nTHE RATES.  REPUBLICANS HAVE A IF YOU\nARE-SEAT ADVANTAGE IN THE SENATE.\nDEMOCRATS HAVE A VERY GOOD CHANCE THAT IS GETTING BETTER\nAFTER THE RELEASE OF THAT TAPE TO WIN THE MAJORITY.\nON THE HOUSE DEMOCRATS NEED 30 SEATS TO WIN THE MAJORITY.\nTHAT HAS BEEN A LONG SHOT ALL YEAR LONG.\nIT IS STILL A LONG SHOT RIGHT NOW.\nTHAT LONG SHOT IS GETTING CLOSER TO POSSIBILITY IN THE WAKE OF\nNUMBERS LIKE THIS.

LET HE WHO HAS NOT SINNED CAST\nTHE FIRST STONE.\" WE'RE HEARING NOW FROM CARL\nICAHN KEEPING HIS SUPPORT BEHIND DONALD TRUMP, OR AT LEAST\nCERTAINLY SOUNDS THAT WAY HERE. JUST WONDER, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE\nOTHER HIGH LEVEL WALL STREETERS, IF YOU WILL, WHO ARE SUPPORTING\nDONALD TRUMP. IF WE HEAR ANYTHING FROM THEM,\nTHE JOHN PAULSONS OF THE WORLD, AND OTHERS WHO ARE PART OF THE\nECONOMIC TEAM OR HAVE JUST PLEDGED THEIR OUTRIGHT SUPPORT\nEITHER MONETARILY OR WITH THEIR WORDS OF ENDORSEMENT.\nSTEVE. >> I DON'T THINK THEY MATTER.\nBY THE WAY, YEAH, THAT MAY BE TRUE WHAT CARL IS SAYING, BUT I\nTHINK WE HAVE TO HOLD MAYBE NOT IN THIS RACE, BUT GENERALLY,\nSOMEBODY WHO IS GOING TO BE PRESIDENT TO A DIFFERENT\nSTANDARD, A HIGHER STANDARD. AS I SAID, THAT'S DIFFICULT TO\nDO IN THIS RACE. TRUMP IS THE GUY WHO SAID I CAN\nGO IN THE STREET AND SHOOT SOMEBODY AND I WOULD PROBABLY\nGET MORE VOTES OUT OF IT. WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THE BREAK\nIN TERMS OF WHEN HILLARY WOULD PULL AHEAD, AND I THINK THE\nMARKET SPEAKS VERY LOUDLY HERE IN SAYING THAT WE HAD THE FIRST\nDEBATE. HILLARY WAS A CLEAR WINNER\nTHERE. THE MARKET TRADED HIGHER.\nTHE PESO RALLIED. >> THE PESO IS ALSO TAKING A\nLITTLE BIT OF A MOVE HIGHER ON THE NEWS OF THE RYAN CONFERENCE\nCALL. >> RIGHT.\nWE HAD THE RALLY LAST NIGHT. IT'S TAKING MOVEMENT.\nI WAS ON A CONFERENCE CALL WITH ONE OF THE EUROPEAN HEDGE FUNDS\nWE'RE INVESTING WITH TODAY GIVING ME THE THIRD QUARTER\nUPDATE, AND THEY SAID, LOOK, IF TRUMP WINS, WE COULD HAVE A\nBREXIT TYPE MOVE. WE'RE LOOKING FOR AN 8% TO 10%\nCORRECTION IF TRUMP WINS. COULD RALLY BACK, BUT THAT'S\nWHAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR. THE INVERSE, OF COURSE, IS THAT\nRIGHT NOW WITH THE MARKET SAYING, OKAY, HILLARY IS LOOKING\nBETTER. THE POLLS ARE SHOWING WHAT\nTHEY'RE SHOWING. THERE'S MORE STABILITY.\nTHERE'S MORE COMFORT IN THE OUTCOME.\nWE COULD GRIND UP MORE AND MORE. I DON'T THINK WHAT CARL ICAHN\nSAID IS WHAT UNDECIDED VOTERS ARE LOOKING FOR IN TERMS OF\nCOMFORT WITH TRUMP OR WHAT PAULSON SAYS OR ANYBODY.\nTHAT'S NOT WHAT'S GOING ON. THAT DIE HAS ALREADY BEEN CAST.\nPEOPLE WILL SAY, OKAY, WE'LL GO WITH YOU.\nIT'S NOT NEW VOTERS. >> LET ME GET BACK TO WHAT THE\nMARKET -- WHAT WE'RE WATCHING TODAY.\n>> I WOULD RATHER TALK. >> WHETHER YOU THINK THAT WE ARE\nNOW ON THE CUSP OF WHAT COULD BE AN OCTOBER SURPRISE AND A\nMELT-UP FOR STOCKS THAT NOBODY WAS ANTICIPATING, MONEY THAT'S\nBEEN ON THE SIDELINE COMES INTO THE MARKET.\nMAYBE SOME UNCERTAINTY OVER THE ELECTION IS PERCEIVED TO HAVE\nBEEN REMOVED AND YOU GET A MELT-UP.\nIS THAT LIKELY? >> IT FEELS LIKE IT, AND THE\nCOMBINATION OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN TERMS OF THE ROTATION, SCOTT.\nI MEAN, WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR A LITTLE WHILE, AND\nJOSH CORRECTLY POINTS OUT. HE IS TALKING ABOUT APPLE.\nFORGET APPLE FOR A MOMENT. HOW ABOUT THE ENTIRE TECH\nSECTOR. LOOK AT INTEL AND THE CHIPS AND\nTHE SEMIS ARE ON FIRE. THEY'RE HITTING 52-WEEK HIGHS.\nTHEN YOU LOOK OVER AT THE ENERGY SPACE.\nTHE LAST WEEK AND A HALF, TWO WEEKS, ALL WE HAVE HAD IS\nUNUSUAL BUYING EVERYWHERE ACROSS ENERGY.\nTHOSE THAT ARE IN THE LOWER END, SOME OF THE MORE HIGH RISK, THE\nBETA PLAYS, AND SOME OF THE BIGGER NAMES AS WELL.\nWHEN YOU SEE WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE MARKET RIGHT NOW, SCOTT,\nIT'S A ROTATION. ONCE AGAIN, WE HAVEN'T BROKE OUT\nYET. IT'S A ROTATION ONCE AGAIN, AND\nWE'RE SEEING -- >> TRANSPORTS TOO.\n>> WE'RE SEEING FINANCIALS AND TRANSPORTS WHERE.\n>> HANGING NEAR HIGHS. >> THE TRANSPORTS HAVE BEEN\nMOVING AROUND FOR A WHILE NOW. >> EVEN AS ENERGY PRICES HAVE\nCONTINUED TO GO UP. >> RIGHT.\n>> AND OIL GOES ABOVE 50. >> HERE'S THE QUESTION.\nI THINK WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT ENERGY,\nHAVE WE NOW REACHED UP AND NOW WE'RE IN A DIFFERENT AREA IN\nTERMS OF THE RANGE? WE WERE IN A 40 TO 50.\nNOW HAVE WE MOVED UP AND ARE CLOSER TO A 45, 52, SOMETHING\nLIKE THAT. YOU CAN SEE WHAT'S GOING ON\nRIGHT NOW AND THE EXCITEMENT THAT PEOPLE HAVE IN ROTATING OUT\nOF UTILITIES, WHICH WAS WHERE EVERYBODY WANTED TO PARK, AND\nNOW THEY'RE STARTING TO GO TO OTHER AREAS, BUT THEY ESTIMATE\nARE LOOKING FOR DIVIDEND. >> LET'S GO PERFORMANCE CHASES.\nTHAT WHAT CARRIES THE MARKET HIGHER?\n>> THAT'S DEFINITELY GOING TO BE A FACTOR HERE BECAUSE THERE WERE\nA LOT OF PEOPLE EARLIER THIS YEAR WHO DIDN'T BELIEVE THE\nMARKET WOULD RALLY, AND IN THE LATE SUMMER WHEN WE BROKE ABOVE\n2,100 -- >> THERE HAVE BEEN PEOPLE A\nCOUPLE OF WEEKS AGO WHO -- THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T\nTHINK THE MARKET IS GOING TO RALLY BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF\nTHE YEAR. I'M WONDERING ABOUT THE SURPRISE\nFACTOR AND HOW YOU NEED TO BE PREPARED FOR IT.\n>> HERE'S WHAT I THINK YOU GOT TO REALLY WONDER ABOUT.\nWE MAY BE SEEING A MULTI-UP JUST TODAY BECAUSE OF THE NEWS OVER\nTHE WEEKEND AND ON FRIDAY ABOUT TRUMP.\nWHAT'S REALLY GOING TO CARRY THIS HIGHER IS EARNINGS.\nA LOT OF US HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SECOND HALF OF THIS YEAR\nEARNINGS PICKING UP AND BEING A CRESCENDO INTO 2017.\nWE'RE ABOUT TO GET THE THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS SEASON\nUNDERWAY, AND THAT HAS TO CONFIRM THE MOVE THAT STARTED\nWELL BEFORE THIS TRUMP NEWS. IT STARTED BACK IN AUGUST WHEN\nWE BROKE ABOVE 2,134 ON THE S&P  >> DOESN'T IT NEED TO CONFIRM\nTHAT THE SESSION IS OVER? DOESN'T NEED TO BE THE MOST\nBLOW-OUT EARNINGS NUMBERS? >> I THINK THAT'S ALREADY IN THE\nSTOCK MARKET. REMEMBER, WE WERE KIND OF STUCK\nFOR ABOUT TWO YEARS BETWEEN 1900 AND 2,100 ON THE S&P 500.\nNOW WE'RE CLEARLY ABOVE THAT RANGE.\nIN A 2,100 TO 2,200 RANGE. IF WE'RE GOING TO BREAK OUT\nABOVE THAT, THERE HAS TO BE SOME STELLAR GUIDANCE GOING FORWARD\nIN MY OPINION BECAUSE THE MARKET IS ALREADY PRICED IN THE\nEARNINGS RECESSION COMING TO AN END.\n>> ALL RIGHT. WELL, IN A YEAR THAT'S BEEN\nUNKIND TO MANY ACTIVE MANAGERS, OUR NEXT GUEST IS DELIVERING\nALPHA AND IN A BIG WAY. BILL NIGREN'S PORTFOLIO IS UP\n10% THIS YEAR BEATING 95% HE OF HIS PEERS.\nHE RUNS THE OAKMARK FUNDS THAT LOOKS FOR DEEP VALUE PLAYS.\nHE IS LIVE AGAIN FROM CHICAGO. WELCOME BACK.\n>> THANK YOU. >> HOW HAVE YOU DONE IT?\nIT'S BEEN A PRETTY GOOD YEAR. >> WELL, WHAT WE DO AT OAKMARK\nHASN'T CHANGED FOR THE NOW 25 YEARS THAT WE'VE BEEN IN\nBUSINESS. WE LOOK TO IDENTIFY OUT OF FAVOR\nCOMPANIES SELLING AT A LARGE DISCOUNT TO INTRINSIC VALUE RUN\nBY MANAGEMENTS THAT TRY TO MAXIMIZE LONG-TERM PER SHARE\nVALUE. THIS YEAR THAT'S LED US TO A LOT\nOF THE FINANCIAL STOCKS, SOME OF THE ECONOMICALLY CYCLICAL NAMES.\nYOU KNOW, THAT'S WHERE THE VALUE HAS BEEN EVEN THOUGH THAT'S NOT\nBEEN WHAT'S POPULAR. >> YOU DON'T BUY MANY STOCKS,\nBUT WHEN YOU DO, YOU CERTAINLY PUT YOUR MONEY BEHIND IT.\nYOU HAVE GOT MGM RESORTS. YOU BOUGHT IT FOR THE FIRST TIME\nEVER. THAT'S ONE OF YOUR MOST RECENT\nIF ONLY NEW BUYS. WHY?\n>> RIGHT. THAT WAS OUR ONLY ADD IN THE\nPAST QUARTER. AT OAK MARK WE'VE KIND OF MADE\nUP OUR OWN VERSION OF THE 80-20 RULE.\nWHEN 80% OF WHAT PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT IN A COMPANY IS\nRELATING TO A DIVISION THAT'S ONLY 20% OF THE VALUE, THAT\nUSUALLY LEADS TO A PRETTY GOOD OPPORTUNITY.\nI THINK RIGHT NOW INVESTORS ARE WAY OVERLY FOCUSED ON MGM McCAU\nRESULTS, AND THAT'S ONLY 15% OF OUR ESTIMATE OF VALUE, AND\nTHEY'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO HOW POSITIVE THE SUPPLY DEMAND\nOUTLOOK IS ON THE LAS VEGAS STRIP WHERE MGM HAS MOST OF THE\nVALUE OF ITS PROPERTIES. IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE INDIVIDUAL\nCASINOS ARE TRADING HANDS, MGM'S PROPERTIES VALUED AT THOSE SAME\nPRICES WOULD BE ABOUT 50% HIGHER THAN THE CURRENT STOCK PRICE.\n>> LOOKING AT THE REST OF YOUR PORTFOLIO, YOU HAVE ALPHABET AND\nTHEN I KNOW YOU LIKE THE FINANCIALS.\nTHEY'RE AMONG YOUR LARGER HOLDINGS.\nI WANT TO TALK ABOUT THOSE. ALPHABET FIRST.\nSHOULD ALPHABET HAVE BOUGHT TWITTER?\nI DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA IF IT TLESHD HAVE BOUGHT TWITTER.\nONE OF THE THINGS WE LIKE ABOUT ALPHABET IS WE THINK THE\nMANAGEMENT IS ECONOMICALLY MOTIVATEED IN HOW IT THINKS\nABOUT POTENTIAL AK REQUEST IZ  IF THEY DECIDE TO BUY IT, MY BET\nWOULD BE THAT THEY THINK IT'S GOING TO IMPROVE THE PER SHARE\nVALUE. >> IT WOULD HAVE NO -- IT WOULD\nHAVE NO AFFECT ON HOW YOU THOUGHT ABOUT WHETHER IT WAS A\nGOOD ACQUISITION OR NOT? >> ON WHETHER OR NOT --\n>> YEAH. >> DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE A\nGOOD ACQUISITION FOR ALPHABET? >> I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT\nTWITTER TO KNOW THAT. IF A COMPANY LIKE GOOGLE LOOKED\nAT IT, THEY WOULD CONSIDER BUYING IT IF THEY THOUGHT IT\nCOULD IMPROVE THEIR PER SHARE VALUE.\nOUR WHOLE FOCUS IS ON LONG-TERM PER SHARE VALUE.\nIT'S NOT TRYING TO OUTGUESS MANAGEMENT ON SHORT-TERM\nDECISIONS. YOU LOOK AT A COMPANY LIKE\nALPHABET, AND WE THINK MAYBE HALF THE STOCK PRICE IS MADE UP\nOF ASSETS THAT YOU DON'T SEE IN ITS PE RATIO.\nYOU KNOW, THEY ARE INVESTING SOMETHING LIKE $4 A SHARE PER\nYEAR IN WHAT'S LIKE VENTURE CAP INVESTMENTS.\nTHAT GOES THROUGH THEIR INCOME STATEMENT.\nIF THEY BOUGHT IT THE SAME PROPERTIES THROUGH VENTURE CAP\nFIRMS, IT WOULD GO ON THE BALANCE SHEET.\nTHEY'VE GOT $120 A SHARE IN CASH THAT'S NOT EARNING ANYTHING.\nTHEY'VE GOT YOUTUBE, WHICH IF IT WAS VALUED LIKE CABLE TV\nNETWORKS WOULD BE SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS A SHARE.\nNONE OF THAT IS REALLY ACCOUNTED FOR WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALPHABET\nSELLING OVER 30 TIMES EARNINGS. IF YOU SUBTRACT THOSE -- I'M\nSORRY. IF YOU SUBTRACT THOSE NAMES OUT,\nI THINK YOU'RE PAYING SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN A MARKET\nMULTIPLE FOR THE GOOGLE SEARCH ENGINE BUSINESS WHICH WE THINK\nHAS GOOD TAIL WINDS BEHIND IT. >> FORGIVE ME FOR INTERRUPTING\nYOU, BILL. >> SORRY.\n>> DO YOU OWN WELLS FARGO OR NO? >> WE HAVE A SMALL POSITION IN\nWELLS FARGO IN THE OAKMARK FUND. ITS NOT AS HEAVILY WEIGHTED AS\nBANK AMERICA, CITI, AND JP MORGAN.\nWE THINK ALMOST ALL THE BANKS ARE ATTRACTIVE, BELIEVE THEY\nDESERVE TO SELL AT A PREMIUM TO BOOK VALUE AND THAT AS WE GET TO\nAN END OF THIS PERIOD WHERE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ARE\nGROWING, THAT HAD HE WILL BE ABLE TO RETURN MOST OF THE CASH\nFLOW THAT THEY GENERATE TO THE OWNERS.\n>> YEAH. I ONLY ASK YOU, OBVIOUSLY, IN\nLIGHT OF THE RECENT SCANDAL THERE AND WHETHER IF YOU DID OWN\nIT, YOU HAD LIGHTENED UP YOUR POSITION OR ALTOGETHER GOT OUT\nAS A RESULT OF WHAT HAPPENED THERE.\nFINANCIALS IN GENERAL, THOUGH, PEOPLE THOUGHT THESE STOCKS WERE\nGOING TO PERFORM BECAUSE INTEREST RATES ARE GOING TO GO\nUP. YES, RATES HAVE BACKED UP A\nLITTLE BIT IN THE LAST, YOU KNOW, COUPLE OF WEEKS OR SO.\nDO YOU THINK THAT ENVIRONMENT HAS CHANGED FOR REAL ANY TIME\nSOON, THOUGH? >> WELL, I THINK IT'S HARD TO\nGET RID OF HUNDREDS OF YEARS OF HISTORY WHERE INTEREST RATES HAVE AVERAGED A LITTLE MORE THAN\nTHE INFLATION RATE. WE ARE FORECASTING SOME INCREASE\nIN INTEREST RATES. I THINK IMPORTANTLY, WITHOUT\nINTEREST RATES -- WITH INTEREST RATES BEING BARELY POSITIVE, THE\nBANKS TODAY ARE EARNING PRETTY DECENT RETURNS.\n7% OR 8% ON THEIR BOOK VALUE. WE THINK THEY'LL BE HIGHER AFTER\nINTEREST RATES INCREASE, BUT EVEN ON TODAY'S EARNINGS, THESE\nSTOCKS ARE SELLING AT LARGE DISCOUNTS TO THE MARKET\nMULTIPLE. >> BILL, I'M GOING TO LET YOU\nRUN. I DON'T SEE ANY CUBBIES PIN, BUT\nARE THEY FINALLY GOING TO DO IT? >> I SURE HOPE SO.\nI THINK WE'VE GOT A BETTER CHANCE THAN ANY OF THE OTHER\nTEAMS THAT ARE LEFT. THE PROBLEM IS YOU HAVE GOT TO\nGET THROUGH THREE SERIES, AND EVEN THOUGH WE DESERVE TO BE\nFAVORED IN EACH ONE, COMBINED PROBABILITIES LIKE THAT MAKE IT\nLOOK TOUGH. IT'S GOING TO BE A FUN PLAYOFF\nSERIES. >> THAT'S THE ANALYSIS WE ARE\nLOOKING FOR AS WELL. BILL NIGREN, APPRECIATE YOUR\nTIME. >> THANK YOU.\n>> ROBERT FRANK HAS BREAKING NEWS FOR US.\n>> WE NOW HAVE A STATEMENT FROM WARREN BUFFETT RESPONDING TO THE\nCLAIM BY DONALD TRUMP LAST NIGHT THAT MR. BUFFETT HAD TAKEN A\n\"MASSIVE DEDUCTION AND MASSIVE CHARGE\" JUST LIKE DONALD TRUMP\nHAD, REFERRING TO DONALD TRUMP'S $960 MILLION LOSS CARRY-FORWARD\nTHAT ALLOWED HIM TO GO OVER A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME WITHOUT\nINCOME TAXES. WHAT MR. BUFFETT IS SAYING TODAY\nIS THAT HIS 2015 RETURN SHOWS ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME OF ABOUT\n$11.6 MILLION. HIS DEDUCTIONS ONLY TOTALED $5.5\nMILLION OF WHICH THE ALLOWABLE CHARITABLE DEDUCTIONS WERE\nAROUND 3.5. THE TOTAL CHARITABLE\nCONTRIBUTION THAT IS MR. BUFFETT MADE IN THAT YEAR WERE AROUND\n$2.85 BILLION, AND HE SAID MOST OF THAT DEDUCTION WAS NOT TAKEN\nBECAUSE IT'S NOT ALLOWED. THERE'S A CAP ON CHARITABLE\nDEDUCTIONS. IN SHORT, WE HAVE $11.6 MILLION\nIN INCOME, DEDUCTING ABOUT $5.5 MILLION, WITH HIS TOTAL TAXES\nPAID THAT YEAR OF $1.85 MILLION. NOW, HE SAYS -- THIS IS VERY\nIMPORTANT. \"I HAVE PAID FEDERAL INCOME TAX\nEVERY YEAR SINCE 1944 WHEN I WAS 13 YEARS OLD.\nTHOUGH BEING A SLOW STARTER, I OWED ONLY $7 IN THAT YEAR.\"\nHE SAID HE HAS COPIES OF ALL 72 OF HIS RETURNS.\nNONE OF THEM HAS EVER USED A LOSS CARRY-FORWARD LIKE\nMR. TRUMP USED. NOW, HE SAID FINALLY, I HAVE\nBEGNAUD ITED BY THE IRS, AND I AM CURRENTLY BEING AUDITED, BUT\nI HAVE NO PROBLEM RELEASING MY TAX INFORMATION WHILE UNDER\nAUDIT AND NEITHER SHOULD MR. TRUMP.\nMR. BUFFETT RESPONDING HERE WITH SOME DETAILS OF HIS OWN TAXES\nSAYING HE HAS NEVER USED A LOSS CARRY-FORWARD LIKE THAT, AND HE\nDOESN'T EVEN TAKE THE FULL DEDUCTION ON HIS GIANT\nCHARITABLE GIFTS BECAUSE HE CAN'T BY LAW.\nBACK TO YOU. >> ROBERT FRANK, THANKS FOR THE\nLATEST THERE. HAVE A LOT MORE AHEAD ON \"THE\nHALFTIME REPORT.\" >> _#DROPPING LIKE A STONE.\nTWITTER DOWN AGAIN TODAY. BIG-TIME.\nIF NOBODY IS BUYING THE COMPANY NOW, WILL THEY EVER?\nAND A HUGE DAY FOR THE HEALTH CARE SECTOR.\nMYLAN SHOOTING HIGHER. BRISTOL-MYERS FALLING.\nWE'RE TALKING ABOUT A KEY UPGRADE AND THE IMPACT OF A\nEUROPEAN CANCER CONFERENCE ON SOME OF THE BIGGEST NAMES IN THE\nBUSINESS. BEFORE THE BREAK, OIL BUSTS\nABOVE 50. OUR KESHO PARTNERS SHOW CAN OIL\nJUMP $10 IN THREE MONTHS? THE S&P PICKS UP ALMOST 6%.\nAIRLINES FAIR POORLY. FOR MORE ON THIS, GO TO\nCNBC.COM/PRO.

WE HAVE SAID THAT FRONT AND\nCENTER. YOU HAVE, WHAT, A $9 PRICE\nTARGET. SO A YEAR FROM NOW WHAT DOES\nTWITTER LOOK LIKE? A, IS IT INDEPENDENT?\nB IS WHAT? >> WELL, THERE'S A RANGE OF\nOUTCOMES. INDEPENDENCE IS ONE.\nSECOND WOULD BE THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL PERFORMANCE OF THE\nBUSINESS LEADS THE EQUITY TO GET PROPERLY VALUED SUCH THAT TO THE\nEBS TENT THERE AREN'T ANY REAL STRATEGIC BUYERS IN THE MARKET\nTHAT IT COULD GET ACQUIRED AT THAT TIME.\nWE WOULD ARGUE THAT VALUATION IS STILL QUITE A BIT FROM WHERE THE\nSTOCK IS EVEN TRADING TODAY. >> YOU THINK ANY KIND OF DEAL\nIT'S STILL TOO EXPENSIVE AT THESE PRICES?\n>> STOCKS TRADING AT 16 TIMES 2017 EBIDA ON AN EBIDA ESTIMATE\nTHAT'S LIKELY TOO HIGH.

I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT\nCOMPENSATION AND, YOU KNOW, MAYBE THE BIGGER ISSUE HERE.\nLET'S SAY THEY'RE GOING TO GO IT ALONE.\nONE OF THE PROBLEMS INVESTORS HAVE HAD WITH TWITTER IS OUT\nSIZED COMPENSATION PACKAGES FOR EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE\nTO DELIVER GROWTH THE WAY THAT, LET'S SAY, FACEBOOK HAS, BUT\nTHEY'VE HAD TO DO THAT TO KEEP ENGINEERS BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE\nA RISING STOCK PRICE LIKE SOME OF THE OTHER FIRMS.\nIF THEY'RE GOING TO GO IT ALONE, IS THIS GOING TO BE A WORSE\nPROBLEM BECAUSE HOW MANY PEOPLE WANT TO BE IN AN INVESTMENT\nWHERE FOR A LONG TIME THERE WAS CHATTER ABOUT, HEY, IT'S GOING\nTO GET BOUGHT ONE DAY. IF THAT'S NOW OFF THE TABLE,\nWHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO FOR ALL THE TALENT THERE TO KEEP THEM\nFOCUSED AND ENGAGED AS A COMPANY?\n>> THERE WAS RECENTLY A TRUEING UP OF EMPLOYEE EQUITY THAT WAS\nDONE IN THE PAST YEAR, AND THE EQUITY CONTINUES TO DO WHAT IT'S\nBEEN DOING, WHICH IS STRUGGLE THE RISK OF TALENT CONTINUES TO\nRISE, AND THAT CREATES AN 1234E7B9IVE FOR MANAGEMENT TO DO\nTHE SAME THING ALL OVER AGAIN. JUST FURTHER DILUTES CURRENT\nEQUITY OWNERS AS WELL AS WELL AS MAKING IT MORE COMPLICATED\nBECAUSE THOSE SHARES ARE ACTUALLY GRANTED AND ACTUALLY\nHAVE TO BE ACQUIRED BY THE ACQUIRING ENTITY AT THAT TIME.\n>> THANKS FOR CALLING IN. >> YOU WANTED MOORE AT 22?\n>> LISTEN, I WOULD HATE TO -- LOOK, I GET A LOT OF UTILITY OUT\nOF THE PRODUCT PERSONALLY AS WELL AS BEING A SHAREHOLDER.\nI WOULD HATE TO SEE THE COMPANY GET BOUGHT.\n>> I LOVE THE COMPANY. I HATE THE STOCK.\n>> SURE. THE SECOND PART OF THAT IS I\nDON'T KNOW IF THE PRODUCT WOULD HAVE HAD THE SAME AMOUNT OF\nUTILITY TO ITS USERS IF IT WERE TO BECOME A COG IN THE SALES\nFORCE WHEEL. TO BECOME SOMETHING WHERE ALL OF\nWHAT'S GOING ON THE PLATFORM BECOMES A GRIST MILL FOR A\nCOMPANY THAT'S SELLING DATA AND DISNEY, THE SAME STORY.\nIT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT TO GET A HUGE PREMIUM FROM DISNEY, BUT\nWHAT DO THEY DO TO THE PLATFORM? HOW DO THEY SANITIZE IT AND HOW\nDO THEY TURN IT INTO 42nd STREET, WHICH THEY DID?\nI THINK AS A USER AND INVESTOR, MAYBE IT'S TWO SEPARATE THINGS.\nOBVIOUSLY, VOLATILITY IS NOT PLEASANT.\nI DON'T THINK IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD FOR THE FUTURE OF THE\nPLATFORM. I STILL THINK THAT THEY HAVE\nTIME TO FIGURE THINGS OUT. >> OKAY.\nGOT A BIG CALL ON MYLAN. SHARES POPPING.\nTHAT IS JUST AHEAD. FIRST, WE'LL GO TO THE S&P\nSECTOR BOARD TODAY.

THAT'S BETTER.\nYOUR AUDIO IS BETTER. WE APOLOGIZE FOR THAT.\nTHIS CULL SEEMS TO BE BASED, AS WE SAID, ON VALUATION, AND ALSO\nTHE FACT THAT THIS REGULATORY OVERHANG OR THIS SETTLEMENT WITH\nTHE DOJ IS NOW FIRM. >> YES.\nABSOLUTELY. A COMPANY ANNOUNCED A\nSIGNIFICANT SENTIMENT WITH DOJ AFTER THE CLOSE ON FRIDAY.\nPAYING OUT ROUGHLY $465 MILLION TO RESOLVE ALL POTENTIAL FEDERAL\nCLAIMS RELATED TO MISPRICING ALLEGATIONS.\nBOTTOM LINE, WE THINK THE SETTLEMENT REALLY RELEGATES THE\nEPIPEN NEWS FLOW TO THE BACK PAGES, AND WE CAN GO BACK TO\nFOCUSSING ON FUNDAMENTALS. WE THINK THERE'S A CREDIBLE CASE\nHERE EVEN WITH LOWER PROFITABILITY AROUND THE EPIPEN\nFRANCHISE THAT THE COMPANY CAN STILL DELIVER HIGH EPS GROWTH.\n>> I WAS GOING TO BRING THAT UP. YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE\nFUNDAMENTALS. EPIPEN IS A SIGNIFICANT PRODUCT.\nTHEY'RE COMING OUT WITH A GENERIC VERSION THAT MOST PEOPLE\nTHINK HOW COULD IT NOT CUT INTO THE NAME BRAND EPIPEN ITSELF?\nTHE IMPACT COULD BE GREATER THAN PEOPLE LIKE YOU THINK.\nNO? >> NO, ABSOLUTELY.\nTHE INTRODUCTION OF A GENERIC VERSION WILL, IN FACT, HAVE A\nNEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE PROFITABILITY OF THIS FRANCHISE.\nWE ESTIMATE THAT OPERATING PROFITS AROUND THE EPIPEN\nPRODUCT ICHTS COULD BE REDUCED BY 25% TO 30%.\nIF YOU LOOK BACK OVER THE COURSE OF THE PAST EIGHT WEEKS SINCE\nTHIS ISSUE REALLY FIRST MADE IT ON TO PAGE ONE, I MEAN, THE\nCOMPANY HAS LOST NEARLY $7 BILLION IN MARKET VALUE.\nTHAT'S A MULTIPLE OF ALMOST 11 TIMES THE PROFITABILITY OF THE\nENTIRE EPIPEN FRANCHISE. WE WOULD ARGUE THAT THE\nMARKETPLACE IS SIGNIFICANTLY -- IS EFFECTIVELY PRICING THIS\nASSET AT ZERO. YOU KNOW, AGAIN, WHILE\nPROFITABILITY WILL BE HURT BY THE INTRODUCTION OF THE GENERIC\nIT VERSION, WE THINK THAT'S BEEN MORE THAN DISCOUNTED IN THE\nEQUITY. >> WHAT ABOUT IF IT'S NOT LAST\nSHOE TO DROP IN THIS? THERE'S THE RHETORICAL RISK ON\nTHE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. I HAVE NO IDEA OF ANY LITIGATION\nFROM A CIVIL STANDPOINT THAT COULD ARISE THAT COULD BE AN\nISSUE THAT THIS COMPANY HAS TO DEAL WITH.\nDO YOU FACTOR ANY OF THAT INTO YOUR RATING TODAY?\n>> SURE.

TO BREAK IT DOWN, DAN ROTH\nEXECUTIVE EDITOR AT LINKED IN. YOU GUYS HAVE 450 MILLION USERS.\n>> THAT'S RIGHT. >> HOW DO YOU FINDS 100 OR SO?\n>> WE USE A LOT OF DATA TO BOIL IT DOWN TO 100.\nWE'RE LOOKING FOR THINGS LIKE WHAT INDUSTRIES, WHO PEOPLE IN\nCERTAIN INDUSTRIES LOOKING AT MOST OFTEN.\nWHO ARE GETTING MENTIONED IN THE NEWS.\nTHEN WE ASK, WE HAVE AN EDITORIAL OVERLAY ON DOPE OF THE\nDATA THAT ASK INFLUENCERS. ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS WE\nFOUND OUT PEOPLE WHO MADE THIS LIST HAVE 25 TIMES THE.\nA CONNECTIONS THAT MOST MEMBERS HAVE.\nTHESE HIGHLY CONNECTED PEOPLE WHO ARE CLEARLY SPENDING A LOT\nOF THEIR TIME GOING OUT MEETING OTHER FOLKS AND BECAUSE OF THAT\nTHEIR PROFILES ARE GETTING NOTICED AND MAKING THINGS\nHAPPEN. >> QUICK STUDY OF THE LIST WILL\nMAKE ANYONE FEEL UNPRODUCTIVE JUST WITH THEIR ACCOMPLISHMENTS,\nBUT THESE ARE PEOPLE WE'VE HEARD OF BEFORE.\nFOUNDER OF IMPOSSIBLE FOODS, PEOPLE WHO ARE VENTURE CAPITAL\nPARTNERS WHO SOLD COMPANIES TO YOU PER.\nWERE YOU TRYING TO FIND PEOPLE WHO WOULD HAVE SOME SORT OF\nHEADLINE VALUE OR TRYING TO FIND PEOPLE THAT WERE LESSER KNOWN?\n>> EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE. MOST PEOPLE ON THE LIST ARE NOT\nTHAT WELL-KNOWN. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE ON\nHERE WHO ARE DEFINITELY UNDER THE RADAR.\nIF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE INDUSTRIES.\nONE EXAMPLE -- IF YOU LOOK AT THE LARGER TRENDS ONE OF THE\nINTERESTING PARTS IS THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE\nIN VERY UNSEXY MARKETS, TAKING CONSUMER TECH AND APPLYING IT.\nSO A WOMAN WHO IS REMAKING THE ENTIRE SCRUBS MARKET AND USING\nFAST FASHION AS A WAY TO GO AFTER NURSES AND BRING SCRUBS TO\nTHEM, HER COMPANY IS DOING PHENOMENALLY WELL.\nTHIS GUY, JONAS CLEVELAND WHO IS WALKING THROUGH HALLS OF WALMART\nAT NIGHT AND LOOKING AT INVENTORY.\nTHESE ARE BEHIND THE SCENE KIND OF THINGS HAPPENING THAT ARE\nUSING THE TECH THAT WE'VE SEEN IN OUR EVERY DAY LIFE AND\nAPPLYING IT WAY DOWN THE VALUE CHAIN.\n>> IN FIVE YEARS FROM NOW IS THERE LIKE A NEXT ELON MUSK ON\nTHE LIST? IS THERE ONE PERSON YOU WANT TO\nHIGHLIGHT. >> I'M NOT SURE WHO THAT PERSON\nWOULD BE. THERE'S A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ALL\nOF US WILL END UP WORKING FOR AT SOME POINT.\nTHERE'S A WOMAN AT GOOGLE, VERY INTERESTING WHO IS WORK ON\nTHINGS LIKE HOW TO USE A.I. TO TAKE ON TROPICAL COMMENTS.\nAND SHE'S ALSO LOOKING AT WAYS TO USE ISIS RECRUITMENT\nTECHNIQUES AND REVERSE THEM. BASICALLY WHEN PEOPLE COME ON TO\nTUBE AND SEEKING ISIS RECRUITMENT THEY FIND GOOGLE\nPRODUCED ANTI-ISIS VIDEOS. SO SHE'S USING MARKETING, A.I.,\nYOUTUBE AS A WAY TO REVERSE IT. >> CAN I ASK YOU WHAT'S A\nLINKEDIN STILL QUESTION. IN TERM OF THE METRICS, HOW\nCONNECTED ARE PEOPLE, HOW MUCH THEY ARE USING THE SYSTEM.\nTHERE ARE THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKE PROFESSIONAL SOCIAL\nNETWORKERS YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. THEY SEEM TO SPEND ALL THEIR\nDAY, I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY HAVE THE TIME TO DO WHATEVER THEIR\nTECHNICAL JOB IS. THEY USED TO HAVE A GREAT TITLE.\nYOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALK ABOUT. YOU WITH ME?\nHOW DOES THAT HAPPEN. >> FIRST OF ALL WE DID LOOK HOW\nCONNECTED PEOPLE ARE. THAT'S NOT ONE OF THE THINGS WE\nWERE MEASURING. IT TURNED OUT TO BE IMPORTANT.\nWHAT WE WERE LOOKING AT MUCH MORE IF YOU'RE IN AN INDUSTRY\nWHOSE PROFILES ARE YOU LOOKING AT.\nBASICALLY IF YOU'RE IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY WHO ARE THE\nPEOPLE IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY WHO OTHER PEOPLE ARE\nLOOKING FOR. WHO ARE THE RECRUITERS ARE\nTRYING TO CHASE. >> I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THAT\nGOOGLE THING WITH ISIS. WHAT IF SOMEBODY SEARCHES\nREPUBLICAN PRINCIPLES AND THEN IMMEDIATELY DIRECTED TO --\nGOOGLE ALREADY DOES THIS. HERE'S A BETTER WAY.\nOR IF YOU SEARCH TRUMP AND IT COMES UP LET'S TALK ABOUT\nHILLARY. THIS MIGHT BE A BETTER THING.\nGOOGLE -- THEY ALREADY DO THAT. THEY AGGREGATE THINGS THAT --\nFACEBOOK TOO THAT SHOWS THEIR POLITICAL LEANINGS.\n>> THE QUESTION IS WHO IS GOING TO BECOME THE NEXT ELON MUSK.\n>> WHO WILL GET THE BIGGEST GOVS FOR THEIR COMPANY?\n>> THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT. >> WHY IS 35 THE AGE CUTOFF FOR\nTHIS? WE JUST HEARD FROM BOB THAT\nMILLENNIALS AREN'T VOTING AND DON'T CARE ABOUT THE IMPORTANT\nISSUES. >> HE DIDN'T EVEN TELL US THE\nWAY HE REALLY FEELS. >> TO FIND PEOPLE WHO WILL BE\nTHE NEXT ELON MUSK. WHO ARE GOING TO LEAD BIG\nMOVEMENTS. WE WANT TO TRY TO IDENTIFY THEM\nNOW BEFORE THEY BECOME THESE LEADERS.\nTHIS ISN'T A WAY TO SAY THESE ARE INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL\nPEOPLE. WHAT WE WANT ARE THESE ARE\nPEOPLE TO KEEP AN EYE ON IF YOU'RE HIRING, IF YOU WANT TO\nWORK FOR SOMEONE. IF YOU WANT TO HAVE SOMEONE IN\nYOUR COMPANY LEADING SOME BIG THING GOING ON.\nCHECK OUT THESE NAMES. >> WHERE CAN PEOPLE FIND THE\nNEXT WAVE LIST? >> GO TO LINKEDIN.\nYOU'LL SEE IT IN YOUR FEED.

MIKE PENCE TOLD CNN A SHORT TIME\nAGO THAT TRUMP EXPRESSED GENUINE REMORSE, HE THOUGHT, FOR WHAT\nPENCE CALLS OFFENSIVE LANGUAGE. MIKE PENCE ALSO SAYS IT'S\nABSOLUTELY FALSE THAT HE EVER CONSIDERED WITHDRAWING FROM THE\nTICKET. >> CNN'S PHIL MATTINGLY IS LIVE\nIN WASHINGTON WITH MUCH MORE ON THIS.\nTHE FACT THAT IT IS NEWS THAT THE RUNNING MATE IS STICKING\nWITH THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, THAT'S PRETTY AMAZING.\n>> Reporter: YEAH, IF YOUR BASELINE FOR VICTORY AFTER THE\nDEBATE IS YOUR RUNNING MATE DID NOT DECIDE TO JUMP OFF THE\nTICKET, LAST NIGHT WAS CLEARLY A ROUSING SUCCESS FOR THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN. BUT SERIOUSLY, IF YOU LOOK AT\nKIND OF MANU WAS LAYING THIS OUT WELL, WHERE REPUBLICANS ARE\nTODAY COMPARED TO WHERE THEY WERE 48 HOURS AGO, 24 HOURS AGO,\nTHERE'S A FEELING CERTAINLY WITHIN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN THAT\nTHEY ARE IN A MUCH BETTER PLACE AND THEY BELIEVE THE\nACCUSATIONS, THE ALLEGATIONS, THE HOT MIC MOMENT ITSELF HAS\nBEEN ASKED AND ANSWERED AND IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON.\nHERE'S WHAT MIKE PENCE SAID IN THAT INTERVIEW WITH CNN.\n>> I WAS OFFENDED BY THEM. I SAID I COULDN'T DEFEND THEM\nAND ENCOURAGED DONALD TRUMP TO CONTINUE TO EXPRESS HIS GENUINE\nREMORSE. I THINK LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED HIS\nHEART TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. HE SAID HE APOLOGIZED TO HIS\nFAMILY, APOLOGIZED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THAT HE WAS\nEMBARRASSED BY IT, THEN HE MOVED ON TO THE REAL CHOICE IN THIS\nELECTION WHICH IS REALLY NOT JUST A CHOICE BETWEEN TWO\nCANDIDATES. IT'S A CHOICE BETWEEN TWO\nFUTURES. >> GUYS, THAT'S THE MESSAGE YOU\nHAVE BEEN HEARING FROM TRUMP SURROGATES REPEATEDLY OVER THE\nCOURSE OF THE LAST 12 HOURS. DONALD TRUMP IS THE NEW HILLARY\nCLINTON IS THE OLD. DONALD TRUMP IS THE\nANTI-ESTABLISHMENT, CLINTON IS THE ESTABLISHMENT.\nIT'S A MESSAGE THEY FEEL LIKE CAN WORK.\nNOW, THE BIG ISSUE, THOUGH, WE HAVE HEARD THIS A LOT FROM\nCLINTON ADVISERS, IN THE WAKE OF LAST NIGHT'S DEBATE WHILE THEY\nMIGHT HAVE STEADIED DONALD TRUMP WITHIN THE PARTY OR AT LEAST\nSTAUNCHED THE FLOW OF DEFECTIONS, DID THAT ACTUALLY\nWIN HIM ANY VOTES. WAS IT GREAT FOR REPUBLICAN\nPRIMARY VOTERS, WAS IT GREAT FOR RILING UP THE BASE?\nNO QUESTION ABOUT IT. IS IT GREAT FOR THE SUBURBS OF\nDENVER, FOR THE SUBURBS OF COLUMBUS, NOT SO MUCH.\nTHAT'S KIND OF HOW BOTH CAMPAIGNS ARE SPINNING THIS.\nI DO THINK THERE'S ONE REALLY IMPORTANT POINT HERE.\nIT'S CLEAR THAT REPUBLICANS ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE COMFORTABLE\nAFTER LAST NIGHT'S DEBATE BUT IF YOU THINK IN TALKING TO CLINTON\nADVISERS THAT TEAM CLINTON IS GOING TO LET THAT HOT MIC MOMENT\nOFF THE SHELF ANY TIME SOON, OR IF YOU THINK THAT THEY ARE NOT\nSEARCHING FOR MORE OF THESE TYPES OF ISSUES TO COME OUT IN\nTHE DAYS AHEAD, YOU ARE GOING TO BE SADLY MISTAKEN.\nI THINK THAT, EVEN AS PEOPLE GET A LITTLE MORE COMFORTABLE, IS\nTHE UNDERLYING CONCERN THAT STICKS WITH EVERY SINGLE\nREPUBLICAN. GUYS?\n>> ALL RIGHT. PHIL MATTINGLY, THANKS SO MUCH.\nWANT TO BRING IN THE PANEL TO DISCUSS.\nCNN POLITICAL DIRECTOR DAVID CHALIAN, SENIOR POLITICAL\nREPORTER NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON AND DAVID FAHRENTHOLD, WHO BROKE\nTHE STORY OF THE TRUMP TAPE. THAT SORT OF CHANGED THINGS WHEN\nTHAT CAME OUT. THANKS FOR BEING WITH US.\nDAVID, LET ME START WITH YOU. PENCE NOT LEAVING THE TICKET.\nALSO A PIANO DID NOT FALL ON DONALD TRUMP'S HEAD DURING THE\nDEBATE YESTERDAY IN ST. LOUIS. DOES THAT CONSTITUTE THE VICTORY\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN SAYS IT DOES? >> NO.\nJOHN, IT REALLY DOESN'T. LISTEN, IF YOU ARE 29 DAYS AWAY\nFROM AN ELECTION AND TALKING ABOUT YOUR RUNNING MATE HAS\nANNOUNCED HE'S STAYING WITH YOU AND THAT YOU ARE STOPPING\nDEFECTIONS FROM YOU, THAT'S NOT A PLACE YOU WANT TO BE 29 DAYS\nOUT FROM A CAMPAIGN. YOU GOT TO STEP BACK AND\nREMEMBER, DONALD TRUMP WAS ALREADY IN A DOWNWARD\nTRAJECTORY. HE WAS BEHIND IN THIS RACE\nBEFORE THE STORY BROKE ON FRIDAY THAT DAVID BROKE, AND THEN\nOBVIOUSLY THAT SENT HIM INTO A TAILSPIN.\nLAST NIGHT, HE CHOSE A VERY CLEAR STRATEGY.\nSCORCH THE EARTH, GET ALL OF HIS SUPPORTERS RILED UP AGAIN, PUT\nTHAT FLOOR UNDERNEATH HIM SO HE DOESN'T GO DOWN ANY FURTHER, BUT\nHE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING THAT I CAN SEE THAT IS GOING TO ADD VOTERS\nTO HIS COALITION WHICH MEANS HE'S STILL BEHIND IN THIS RACE.\nTHAT'S THE TRICKY SPOT, THIS DAY AFTER THE DEBATE FOR THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN. >> NIA, ONE OF THE THINGS DONALD\nTRUMP HAD TO ADDRESS LAST NIGHT WAS THE TAPE, AND WHEN ASKED\nABOUT IT THIS IS HOW HE ADDRESSED IT.\n>> I APOLOGIZED TO MY FAMILY, I APOLOGIZED TO THE AMERICAN\nPEOPLE. CERTAINLY I'M NOT PROUD OF IT.\nBUT THIS IS LOCKER ROOM TALK. >> THIS IS LOCKER ROOM TALK AND\nTHAT'S HOW HE EXPLAINED IT SEVERAL TIMES IN TALKING ABOUT\nIT. HOW IS THAT PLAYING?\n>> YOU KNOW, IT'S PLAYING FINE WITH HIS BASE AND THOSE VOTERS\nTHAT DAVID TALKED ABOUT WHO ALREADY LIKE HIM AND ARE ALREADY\nGOING TO VOTE FOR HIM BUT IT LIKELY WON'T PLAY WELL WITH A\nLOT OF REPUBLICAN WOMEN, A LOT OF REPUBLICAN-LEANING\nINDEPENDENTS IN THOSE SUBURBS. THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE HE NEEDS.\nIF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE REACTIONS TO THE DEBATE, IT WAS\nWOMEN, RIGHT, WHO THOUGHT THAT HILLARY CLINTON WON.\nIT WAS WOMEN IN SOME OF THE FOCUS GROUPS WHO STILL DON'T\nTHINK THAT DISMISSIVE ANSWER ABOUT THOSE VERY TROUBLING\nREVELATIONS ON THAT TAPE WITH DONALD TRUMP SAYING THAT HIS\nPOWER GIVES HIM ACCESS TO KISS WOMEN AND TO GROPE THEM, THAT IS\nGOING TO BE I THINK CONTINUOUSLY DAMAGING TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.\nIT'S NOT GOING TO HELP HIM ON HIS EFFORTS TO WIN VOTERS IN THE\nSWING STATES, IN THE SUBURBAN AREAS, COLLEGE EDUCATED WHITE\nWOMEN WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT. IT'S ALSO COLLEGE EDUCATED WHITE\nMEN WHO ARE TROUBLED BY THAT. I WAS TALKING TO SOMEONE EARLIER\nWHO WAS SAYING THAT HE HAD TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH HIS\nCHILDREN ABOUT THIS. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN ABOUT WHAT\nDONALD TRUMP IS SAYING AND YOU KNOW, A LOT OF EMBARRASSMENT\nAROUND DONALD TRUMP'S TALK THERE.\nSO DISMISSING IT AS LOCKER ROOM TALK, I DON'T THINK DONALD TRUMP\nHAS SPENT MUCH TIME IN LOCKER ROOMS.\nYOU HAVE ATHLETES COMING OUT AND SAYING DON'T MALIGN US BY\nSUGGESTING THAT IN LOCKER ROOMS, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SEXUAL\nASSAULT AGAINST WOMEN. IT'S NOT GOING TO HELP HIM WITH\nTHIS ANSWER. AND I THINK THERE'S THIS\nCONTINUING SPECTER OF MORE REVELATIONS AND MORE TAPES\nCOMING OUT INVOLVING DONALD TRUMP SAYING THINGS LIKE THIS.\n>> SO DAVID FAHRENTHOLD, ONE WAY DONALD TRUMP ALSO WAS DEALING\nWITH THIS IS TURNING IT ON BILL CLINTON.\nLAST NIGHT, HE DID BRING UP BILL CLINTON'S PAST SEXUAL\nINDISCRETIONS AND THOSE WHO ACCUSE HIM OF SUCH THINGS AND\nSAT IN THE AUDIENCE FOUR PEOPLE, INCLUDING THREE WOMEN WHO HAVE\nACCUSED BILL CLINTON OF VARIOUS THINGS.\nYOUR PAPER REPORTING THAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN ACTUALLY WANTED\nTO SIT THEM UP FRONT IN THE VIP AREA.\nTHE DEBATE COMMISSION WOULD NOT LET THAT HAPPEN.\nBUT MIKE PENCE WAS TALKING ABOUT IT TODAY.\nTHIS IS NOW A THING. WHEN EVEN MIKE PENCE IS BRINGING\nUP BILL CLINTON'S PAST HERE, IS THIS HERE TO STAY NOW UNTIL\nNOVEMBER? >> IT SEEMS LIKE IT IS.\nIT SEEMS LIKE THIS IS WHAT THEY HAVE SETTLED ON AS BOTH A\nREACTION TO THAT VIDEOTAPE AND ALSO AS A STRATEGY GOING\nFORWARD, TO FOCUS THE ATTENTION ON THESE CASES THAT INVOLVE BILL\nCLINTON IN THREE CASES AND ONE CASE INVOLVING A LEGAL CASE\nWHERE HILLARY CLINTON SERVED AS -- WAS APPOINTED TO BE A\nLAWYER FOR SOMEBODY ACCUSED OF RAPE.\nTHEY WANT THAT TO BE FRONT AND CENTER, LITERALLY FRONT AND\nCENTER LAST NIGHT. I THINK THEY DECIDED TO MAKE\nTHAT CASE. THE INTERESTING THING TO ME IS I\nTHINK A LOT OF AMERICANS DON'T REALLY KNOW MUCH ABOUT THESE\nCASES AND THE WAY THE TRUMP PEOPLE PRESENT THEM, ASSUMES\nTHAT THEY DO. THEY DON'T REALLY EVEN TRY TO\nGIVE THE BACK STORY FOR WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE.\nWHICH I THINK IS MAYBE NOT THE BEST WAY TO EVEN PLAY THAT\nSTRATEGY. >> DAVID, ONCE YOU HAVE GONE\nTHERE, ONCE YOU HAVE GONE THERE BRINGING ACCUSERS TO THE DEBATE,\nTRYING TO GET THEM IN THE FAMILY BOX, THE FAMILY VIP SECTION,\nWHAT ELSE IS THERE? WHERE ELSE CAN YOU GO?\n>> IT'S A GOOD QUESTION. >> LISTEN -- SORRY.\n>> SORRY, DAVID. >> WRONG DAVID.\n>> KATE, I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT IT SEEMED TO ME\nDONALD TRUMP KIND OF THREW HIS HANDS UP LAST NIGHT AND SAID I'M\nNO LONGER PLAYING TO WIN, ALMOST.\nBY GOING DOWN THIS STRATEGY, I DON'T THINK IT IS GOING TO BE\nVERY EASY TO TURN BACK HERE. AS PHIL MATTINGLY WAS SAYING,\nAND ALL OF A SUDDEN MAKE APPEALS TO THE SUBURBS OF DENVER AND\nSUBURBS OF PHILADELPHIA. ONCE YOU GO HERE, YOU ARE ALL IN\nON THE BASE. SO THEN IT'S JUST A MATTER,\nREMEMBER, IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES THE THING THAT VOTERS\nLOVED THE MOST ABOUT HIM, HE TELLS IT LIKE IT IS, HE TAKES\nTHE FIGHT TO HILLARY CLINTON. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WILL\nANIMATE THE FOLKS WITH HIM SO HE'S CLEARLY HEADING DOWN THAT\nPATH. I DON'T SEE HOW YOU TURN BACK\nFROM THAT IN A CONVINCING WAY 29 DAYS TO GO.\n>> SO NIA, HILLARY CLINTON, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING SHE DID\nNOT DELIVER A KNOCKOUT BLOW. SHE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO CRUSH\nTRUMP LAST NIGHT, THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.\nOTHER PEOPLE ARE SAYING THERE ARE ISSUES WHERE SHE ACTUALLY\nMAYBE FUMBLED THE ANSWERS A LITTLE BIT.\nONE OF THEM HAD TO DO WITH THE WIKILEAKS AND THE SUGGESTION\nTHAT SHE SAID AT ONE POINT THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE A PUBLIC AND A\nPRIVATE POSITION ON SOME ISSUES. IN FACT, WHEN SHE WAS MAKING\nTHAT STATEMENT, SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE MOVIE \"LINCOLN\" BUT\nTHIS IS HOW SHE EXPLAINED IT LAST NIGHT.\n>> IS IT ACCEPTABLE FOR A POLITICIAN TO HAVE A PRIVATE\nSTANCE ON ISSUES, SECRETARY CLINTON?\n>> RIGHT. AS I RECALL, THAT WAS SOMETHING\nI SAID ABOUT ABRAHAM LINCOLN -- >> NOW SHE'S BLAMING THE LIE ON\nTHE LATE GREAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN. THAT'S ONE THAT I HAVEN'T --\nHONEST ABE NEVER LIED. THAT'S THE GOOD THING.\nTHAT'S THE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND YOU.\nTHAT'S A BIG BIG DIFFERENCE, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME\nDIFFERENCE. >> SO WHO WON THAT MOMENT?\nIS THIS SOMETHING THAT HILLARY CLINTON NEEDS TO BE CAREFUL WITH\nGOING FORWARD? >> YOU KNOW, I TALKED TO\nSOMEBODY IN THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN ABOUT THIS.\nTHEY FEEL LIKE SHE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH IN THAT ANSWER.\nTHEY ALSO FEEL LIKE IN TERMS OF THE WIKILEAKS IN HER SPEECHES,\nTHAT THE WORST IS OUT THERE BECAUSE I ASKED, I WAS LIKE DOES\nTHIS SORT OF PUT A BURDEN ON YOU TO RELEASE MORE OF THIS AND TO\nPROVE THAT SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT ABRAHAM LINCOLN, AND THEY SAID\nTHEY FEEL LIKE THE WORST IS OUT THERE.\nIT WAS A FUNNY RESPONSE. IT WAS CLEARLY ENJOYED BY THE\nAUDIENCE. TRUMP'S A VERY QUICK REJOINDER\nTO THAT. YOU WONDER IF YOU WILL HEAR\nHILLARY CLINTON MENTION ABRAHAM LINCOLN AGAIN IN THIS.\nTHE LATE GREAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN, I SHOULD SAY.\n>> YEAH. LET'S SEE IF THAT RESPONSE\nHAPPENS AGAIN. THAT WILL BE TELLING.\nGREAT TO SEE YOU, GUYS. THANK YOU SO MUCH.\nONE OF THE MANY ASTONISHING MOMENTS FROM LAST NIGHT, DONALD\nTRUMP VERY PUBLICLY DISAGREEING WITH HIS RUNNING MATE ON A\nCRITICAL NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE.\nSYRIA. WHAT THE CAMPAIGN IS SAYING NOW\nABOUT THAT.",

FLORIDA, NORTH CAROLINA, NEVADA,\nOHIO. ALL OF THEM ARE UP FOR GRABS.\nEVERY OTHER STATE SEEMING TO BE A TRUMP STATE OR A CLINTON\nSTATE. EVEN IF TRUMP, HOWEVER, SWEEPS\nALL OF THESE FOUR STATES THAT ARE UP FOR GRABS, SORRY, THAT'S\nNOT ENOUGH ELECTORAL VOTES. LET'S TALK MORE ABOUT THIS WITH\nOUR POLITICAL PANEL. DAVID THARENFOLD BROKE THE TRUMP\nAUDIO TAPE. A LOT OF PEOPLE NOT HAPPY WITH\nYOU, DAVID, BECAUSE OF THE BAD LANGUAGE.\nFIRST I HAVE TO ASK IN TERMS OF THE SCOOP, ARE THERE MORE TAPES\nCOMING? DO YOU KNOW OF WOMEN WHO ARE\nGOING TO SAY THAT, YES, HE ACTUALLY DID THESE THINGS THAT\nHE CLAIMS IN THE TAPE? >> WELL, THERE'S BEEN WOMEN NOW\nIN THE RECORD BEFORE THIS THAT HAVE SAID IN VARIOUS STORIES\nTHAT SORT OF THING HAD HAPPENED, AND I THINK WE'RE GETTING MORE\nREPORTS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO RUN DOWN OF NEW PEOPLE THAT SAID\nTHIS HAPPENED TO THEM IN THE PAST.\nIT WOULD NOT SURPRISE ME, OR US, FOR NEW PEOPLE TO CONFIRM THAT\nWHAT DONALD TRUMP SAID HE HAD DONE HE DID DO.\n>> THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS TRYING TO EXPAND THE MAP, TRYING\nTO PLAY ARIZONA AND MISSOURI. THE GOVERNOR FOR MISSOURI DIDN'T\nEVEN GO TO THE DEBATE IN THEIR OWN STATE.\nCOULD CLINTON REALLY WIN IN MISSOURI AND ARIZONA?\n>> THEY CAN EXPAND THE MAP. THE REPUBLICAN ELECTORATE HAS\nCHANGED THE CAMPAIGN. WE'VE SEEN OHIO, THE NUMBERS\nBEING DECENT. I JOKED THAT HE WOULD BE THE\nDISRUPTOR WHO WOULD DISRUPT TOO MUCH AND HE WOULD LOSE\nEVERYTHING BUT OHIO AND FLORIDA. THAT MAY BE WHERE WE END UP\nHERE. BECAUSE HE HAS SIGNIFICANT\nDOWNSIDES, AND ALTHOUGH SHE DOES, HE'S NOT DEFT ENOUGH TO\nBEAT HER AT THIS POINT. >> DAVID, WIKILEAKS RELEASED\nANOTHER TROVE OF HACKED E-MAILS FROM CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN\nSTAFFERS. IN ONE OF THE E-MAILS, CHELSEA\nCLINTON IS CALLED A SPOILED BRAT, ANOTHER ONE SAYING WHEN\nCLINTON SHOULD COME OUT WITH THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE IN ORDER NOT\nTO MAKE IT AN ISSUE WITH THE ENVIROS.\nDID ANY OF THIS STRIKE YOU AS NEWSWORTHY?\n>> MY COLLEAGUES ARE GOING THROUGH IT, STILL.\nTHERE IS NOTHING IN THERE THEY'VE FOUND SO FAR BEYOND WHAT\nYOU MENTIONED. THERE IS NOTHING IN THERE THAT\nSHOWS HILLARY CLINTON IN A WHOLE NEW LIGHT OR PUTS THE RACE IN\nSOME NEW POSITION. I THINK THESE ARE THE SORT OF\nTHINGS PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY ALREADY KNEW ABOUT HILLARY\nCLINTON. THESE THINGS ARE BEING\nCONFIRMED. >> THAT MIGHT BE ONE OF THE\nPROBLEMS WITH THESE WIKILEAKS, FOR INSTANCE, WITH THE TROVE\nTHAT WAS RELEASED LAST TIME SHOWING CLINTON WAS COZY WITH\nWALL STREET BANKERS, AND MAYBE SHE HAD A PRIVATE POSITION OR A\nPUBLIC POSITION EVEN IF YOU EXCUSE IT WITH THE LINCOLN\nMOVIE. THESE ARE ARE THINGS PEOPLE\nTHOUGHT ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON AND IT MIGHT BE BAKED IN A\nLITTLE BIT. >> BUT TRUMP IS BAKED IN, TOO.\nI THINK SHE MIGHT BE TRYING TO GET THE BERNIE FOLKS BACK ON,\nTRYING TO GET THEM NOT ONLY VOTING FOR HER BUT VOLUNTEERING\nAND THINGS. THE PROBLEM IS TRUMP DOESN'T\nHAVE A GROUND GAME. HE HAS FROM THE RNC WHICH IS\nVERY DOUBTFUL NOW IF THEY WANT TO WORK WITH HIM AT ALL TO SOME\nDEGREE. I THINK, AGAIN, THE AMERICAN\nPEOPLE ARE ALWAYS WEIGHING, WHO IS THE WORST OF THESE\nCANDIDATES? AND IT'S THA TOUGH CALL.\n>> DAVID, I JUST HAVE TO ASK. WHEN YOU GOT THIS TAPE ON\nFRIDAY, WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION WHEN YOU SAW IT?\nDID YOU JUST THINK, HOLY COW? OR PERHAPS MORE FITTING WORDS\nTHAT WOULD FIT IN WITH THE THEME OF THE TAPE?\nOR DID YOU HAVE ANY IDEA IT WAS GOING TO BE THIS EXPLOSIVE?\n>> I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE BIG.\nI DIDN'T THINK IT WAS GOING TO BE THIS BIG.\nCERTAINLY THE LANGUAGE IN THERE IS SO DIFFERENT THAN WE'VE HEARD\nTRUMP USE. THE KEY THING TO ME WAS THE FACT\nTHAT IT WAS PRIVATE MEANT SO MUCH.\nWE'VE SEEN TRUMP IN PUBLIC SAY OUTRAGEOUS THINGS, THINGS THAT\nWOULD HAVE KILLED OFF MITT ROMNEY OR SOME OTHER REPUBLICAN\nCANDIDATE IN YEARS PAST. WHAT WAS DIFFERENT HERE WAS HE\nWASN'T PLAYING A ROLE, THERE WAS NO SHOWMANSHIP, HE WAS TALKING\nTO A FEW MEN IN PRIVATE TALKING ABOUT SEEMINGLY WHAT HE DID AND\nHAD DONE. I KNEW IT WOULD BE POWERFUL BUT\nNOT AS BIG AS IT TURNED OUT TO BE.\n>> PART OF WHAT MADE IT POWERFUL FOR ME, BECAUSE I'M NOT\nSURPRISED HE TALKS LIKE THIS, IS THAT IT ACTUALLY WASN'T THAT\nPRIVATE. HE WAS MI MIKED UP IN WHAT, FOR\nHIM, IS A PRIVATE SETTING. HE WAS WITH GUYS HE DIDN'T KNOW\nTHAT WELL. IT WASN'T LIKE HE WAS CHATTING\nWITH A BUDDY OR IN A LOCKER ROOM.\nTHAT TO ME IS WHERE IT CROSSED INTO, WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON\nHERE? >> YEAH, IT WAS ODD, AND WE'VE\nDEBATED THIS AND DISCUSSED THIS AT LENGTH, BUT I DON'T KNOW OF\nANY LOCKER ROOM WHERE ANYBODY TALKS LIKE THAT.\nI'VE NEVER HEARD ANY MAN TALK THAT WAY.\nDAVID, YOU'RE A MAN. HAVE YOU EVER HEARD ANYONE TALK\nTHAT WAY? >> NO.\nPEOPLE CALL IT LOCKER ROOM TALK, AND I THINK THE IMPLICATION WAS\nHE WAS JUST USING NAUGHTY WORDS OR HE WAS TALKING ABOUT WOMEN\nAND APPRAISING THEIR A ATTRACTIVENESS.\nTHAT WASN'T THIS. HE WAS SAYING, HERE'S WHAT I DO\nTO WOMEN. I GROPE THEM AND I CAN BECAUSE\nI'M FAMOUS. THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF THING YOU\nHEAR IN ANY LOCKER ROOM. >> LOCKER ROOMS ARE LIKE, GIVE\nME THE BAD NEWS, MAN. >> MARY KATHERINE, ONE THING I\nWANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT, MIKE PENCE WAS AT THE MORNING SHOWS,\nAND HE WAS RAILING AGAINST THE ACCUSERS TRYING TO TAKE A HIT AT\nHILLARY CLINTON.

THE ELECTION IS WHAT WE WOULD BE\nTALKING ABOUT, ANYWAY, BUT -- SO WE DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT BUT I\nDON'T THINK WE WOULD DO IT AS MUCH IF THERE WEREN'T THIS MANY\nJOKES. >> THERE IS A BIG DEBATE GOING\nON IN THE WORLD OF COMEDY RIGHT NOW.\nIT PUTS YOU IN SOMEWHAT OF AN AWKWARD POSITION BECAUSE YOU ARE\nFORMER HEAD WRITER FOR \"SNL\" AND ALSO YOU FOLLOW JIMMY FALLON AND\nHE'S BEEN CRITICIZED FOR BEING TOO SOFT ON DONALD TRUMP.\nBUT SAMANTHA BEE DOES A SHOW CALLED \"FULL FROJNTAL\" ON TBS AD\nHERE'S WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY. >> THEY DID SEVER TIES WITH\nDONALD TRUMP.

THIS PROBABLY HAS NOTHING TO DO\nWITH THIS DEBATE, BUT I WORRY ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY. WE'LL HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO\nAFTER THIS ELECTION IS OVER. >> SO EUGENE, REPUBLICANS WILL\nHAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS. >> I COVERED POLITICS IN\nARIZONA.

CHECK THIS OUT.\nTHIS IS A NEW POLL OF LIKELY VOTERS CONDUCTED IMMEDIATELY\nAFTER THE REVELATION OF TRUMP'S VULGAR 2005 COMMENTS AND BEFORE\nLAST NIGHT'S DEBATE. THIS IS A FOUR-WAY RACE.\nTRUMP IS DOWN 11 POINTS, EFFECTIVELY A LANDSLIDE.\nIN A HEAD TO HEAD MATCHUP, HILLARY IS UP 14 POINTS.\nTHAT WOULD BE A CATASTROPHE AND DEMOCRATS HAVE A LEAD ON WHICH\nPARTY SHOULD CONTROL CONGRESS. THAT'S A GENERIC QUESTION BEING\nASKED. WITH A PARTY IN CRISIS, WE SAW A\nTRIAGE EFFORT FROM TRUMP. THIS WAS A DEBATE PERFORMANCE TO\nREGROUP WHERE THE REPUBLICAN BASE HAS BEEN CHOMPING TO\nDESTROY HILLARY CLINTON. >> BILL CLINTON WAS ABUSIVE TO\nWOMEN. HILLARY CLINTON ATTACKED THE\nSAME WOMEN AND ATTACKED THEM VICIOUSLY.\nFOUR OF THEM ARE HERE TONIGHT. >> SHE HAS TREMENDOUS HATRED.\n>> I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE HIM SIGN ON WITH THE DEVIL.\nI AM GOING TO INSTRUCT MY ATTORNEY GENERAL TO GET A\nSPECIAL PROSECUTOR TO LOOK INTO YOUR SITUATION.\n>> IT'S AWFULLY GOOD THAT SOMEONE WITH THE TEMPERAMENT OF\nDONALD TRUMP IS NOT IN CHARGE IN OUR COUNTRY.\n>> YOU WOULD BE IN JAIL. >> HE SAVED HIS CANDIDACY AND BY\nSHORING UP HIS BASE AND WREAKING HAVOC ON THE HILL.\nPAUL RYAN TELLING REPUBLICANS IN A CONFERENCE CALL THAT HE WILL\nNOT DEFEND TRUMP OR CAMPAIGN WITH HIM.\nHE WAS SUGGESTING THAT HE THINKS THIS RACE IS OVER.\nHIS RALLYING CRY IS MAKE SURE CLINTON DOESN'T GET A BLANK\nCHECK WITH A DEMOCRAT CONTROLLED CONGRESS.\nTHEY PUT OUT THIS STATEMENT SAYING THE SPEAKER WAS GOING TO\nSPEND THE NEXT MONTH FOCUSED ENTIRELY ON PROTECTING OUR\nCONGRESSIONAL MAJORITY. AFTER SLAMMING THEM YESTERDAY,\nTRUMP RIPPED INTO RYAN SAYING HE SHOULD SPENT TIME ON BALANCING\nTHE BUDGET AND JOBS AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND NOT WASTE TIME\nON FIGHTING THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE.\n>> I'M DRAWN BY THE ADVISER SARAH HUCABEE SANDERS.\nIS WHAT WE SAW THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN'S ROAD MAPS TO SUCCESS\nON ELECTION NIGHT? >> I THINK LAST NIGHT WAS A\nGREAT NIGHT FOR DONALD TRUMP. HE SHOWED HE WAS PRESIDENTIAL\nAND SHOWED HE WAS STRONG AND SHOWED HE WAS DEVELOPED AND ON\nMESSAGE. HILLARY WAS RATTLED AND UNHINGED\nAND THE I THINK IT WAS RIGHT FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO SEE.\nANYONE WATCHING THAT WOULD SAY DONALD TRUMP DECISIVELY WON.\n>> JUST TO SAY, THE LATEST POLL, CNN, THE ONLY THAT CAME OUT SAID\nIN FACT HE LOST BY THEIR CALCULATION 57% TO 34%.\nWHAT ARE YOU SEEING THAT THEY MISSED?\n>> I THINK THEY MUST HAVE ONLY POLED THE CLINTONS BECAUSE EVERY\nSINGLE PERSON I TALKED TO AND BASED ON THE REACTION OF THE\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN THEMSELVES, THEY KNOW THAT LAST NIGHT WAS A\nLOSS FOR THEM. ANYBODY THAT SAID HILLARY\nCLINTON WON THE DEBATE DIDN'T WATCH IT OR WAS SPINNING IF ARE\nHILLARY CLINTON. I THINK THE CONTRAST FOR AMERICA\nWAS VERY CLEAR AND AGAIN EVERY BIT OF EVIDENCE I HAVE SEEN WITH\nPEOPLE I TALKED TO SAID DONALD TRUMP WON HANDS DOWN.\n>> ONE OF THE PIECES OF NEWS IS HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN SAYING\nHE WILL NO LONGER DEFEND DONALD TRUMP.\nDO YOU NOW VIEW RYAN IS WHAT TRUMP DESCRIBED AS A SELF\nRIGHTEOUS HYPOCRITE? THIS HAS BEEN ABOUT A GRASS\nROOTS MOVEMENT SINCE DAY ONE AND NEVER ABOUT WASHINGTON, BUT\nEFFORT PEOPLE FROM ACROSS AMERICA.\nIT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE BECAUSE OF THAT SUPPORT.\n>> SHE PART OF THAT GRASS ROOTS MOVEMENT.\nLOOK, I THINK HE IS A LOT MORE A PART OF THE WASHINGTON CROWD\nTHAN HE IS THE GRASS ROOTS CROWD.\nTHIS IS FOCUSED ON THE CROWD AND HE WILL CONTINUE THAT MOVEMENT\nAND THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG REASONS THAT DONALD TRUMP WON\nTHE PRIMARY AND ONE OF THE REASONS HE WILL WIN THE GENERAL\nIN NOVEMBER. >> YOU ARE SATISFIED WITHOUT\nTHAT SUPPORT. YOU CAN WIN WITHOUT HIM?\n>> WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE IT. I THINK WE CAN CERTAINLY WIN\nWITHOUT HIM BEING OUT ON THE TRAIL.\n>> HOW DO YOU COMBAT CHARGES THAT DONALD TRUMP USING BILL\nCLINTON'S ACCUSERS AS A SHIELD FOR HIS OWN MISCONDUCT.\n>> THE CLINTONS WANTED TO START GOING INTO THE GUTTER.\nAND I THINK THAT THE GOAL HERE IS HILLARY CLINTON HERSELF SAID\nSHE WANTED TO GIVE VOICE TO ANYBODY WHO WAS A VICTIM OF\nSEXUAL ASSAULT. SHE SILENCED THE VOICES OF THOSE\nWOMEN. IDEALLY OUR CAMPAIGN AND\nPROBABLY THEIRS AS WELL WOULD LOVE TO MOVE ON TO THE ACTUAL\nISSUES. I THINK IT'S A REAL DISSERVICE\nTO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THEY ONLY TALK ABOUT THE\nPERSONAL FLAWS OF THE CANDIDATES OVER THE NEXT 30 DAYS AND LET'S\nTALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY AND NATIONAL SECURITY.\nWHEN WE DO THAT, DONALD TRUMP WINS AND IF WE STAY FOCUSED ON\nTHE ISSUES, NO DOUBT HE WILL WIN IN NOVEMBER.\n>> BEFORE THE DEBATE HE BROUGHT OUT THE FOUR WOMEN THAT THE\nCAMPAIGN CALLED. WHAT CHANGED?\nTRUMP SAID THAT HE WAS COURAGEOUS FOR NOT GETTING INTO\nTHE GUTTER WITH THE CLINTONS IN THE 1990s SCANDAL.\nIF THAT DISPLAYS COURAGE, WAS LAST NIGHT AN ACT OF\nDESPERATION? >> I DON'T THINK SO.\nHILLARY CLINTON WENT INTO THE GUTTER IN THE FIRST DEBATE.\n>> ON WHAT? >> WHEN SHE BROUGHT UP THE MISS\nUNIVERSE COMMENTS. >> THAT WAS THE GUTTER?\nTHIS WAS DONALD TRUMP'S COMMENTS.\nIS THAT THE GUTTER OR DOES THAT DESCRIBE WHAT SHE CASTS ASA HIS\nLACK OF FITNESS TO BE PRESIDENT. >> SHE IS GOING INTO THE\nPERSONAL FLAWS. BOTH OF THESE CANDIDATES ARE\nFLAWED AS WE ALL ARE. WE ARE FLAWED PEOPLE.\nTHE BIG DIFFERENCE IS HILLARY CLINTON IS NOT ONLY A FLAWED\nPERSON, BUT HAS FLAWED POLICY. SHE HAS BEEN IN GOVERNMENT FOR\n30 YEARS AND HAS NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT.\nDONALD TRUMP CREATED JOBS AND NOT JUST TALKED ABOUT IT.\nHE IS SOMEBODY WHO IS READY TO BE A LEADER AND STEP IN AND\nIMPROVE OUR ECONOMY AND SECURE THE BORDER AND REBUILD THE\nMILITARY AND ALL THE THINGS THAT HILLARY FAILED TO DO.\n>> HE SAID HE WOULD JAIL A POLITICAL OPPONENT.\nIS THAT APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR FOR A CHIEF EXECUTIVE?\n>> HIS POINT IS ANYBODY ELSE IF YOU ARE LAST NAME IS CLINTON\nWOULD HAVE BEEN PENALIZED AND MAYBE PUT IN JAIL.\nHILLARY CLINTON GETS TO PLAY BY A DIFFERENT SET OF RULES THAN\nTHE REST OF AMERICA. UNDER A TRUMP PRESIDENCY, THAT\nWON'T CONTINUE. >> HOW DO SUPPORTERS CHEER THAT\nAFTER ALL THE CRITICISM OF PRESIDENT OBAMA AS A DICTATOR.\nTRUMP IS TALKING ABOUT OVERRIDING THE HEAD OF THE FBI\nAND ATTORNEY GENERAL. >> HIS POINT IS THAT HE WOULD\nENFORCE THE LAW. IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON BROKE THE LAW. SHE HAD A SUBPOENA AND DELETED\nE-MAILS AFTER THAT TOOK PLACE. >> SHE WAS NEVER FOUND TO HAVE\nBROKEN THE LAW. >> WE WOULD NEED A SPECIAL\nPROSECUTOR AND FOUND OUT SHE HAD.\nIF HE IS PRESIDENT, HE WOULD INVESTIGATE THESE THINGS FURTHER\nBY USING A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR AND I DON'T THINK HE WOULD LIKE\nTHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WOULD LIKE WHAT THEY WOULD FIND.\n>> THEY ARE IN THE HANDS OF THE PRESIDENT TO PURSUE THOSE.\nNICE TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\n>> THANK YOU. >> THAT'S OUR PANEL.\nWITH \"USA TODAY,\" THE REPUBLICAN DEAL MAKER SUPER LAWYER AND NBC\nPOLITICAL ANALYST. WE BROUGHT THAT UP A LITTLE BIT.\nWITH \"THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE,\" NICE TO SEE YOU GUYS IN PERSON.\nLADIES FIRST. YOUR REACTION?\nTHIS STRATEGY FOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN SAYING THIS IS WORKING\nFOR THEM. >> WE SEE THE DIVISION AND THAT\nMUST HAVE BEEN PART OF THAT TO THE TRUMP REPUBLICAN PARTY.\nTHEY MANAGED TO WIN THE NOMINATION AND HE WON IT FAIR\nAND SQUARE, BUT THE INTEREST OF THESE TWO GROUPS ARE DIVERGING.\nYOU CAN SEE IT WITH REPUBLICANS BEING UNWILLING TO DEFEND OR\nSUPPORT DONALD TRUMP. DONALD TRUMP NOT CONCERNED ABOUT\nTHE EFFECT HE WILL HAVE DOWN THE BALLOT.\n>> WHERE DOES THE CAMPAIGN GO FROM HERE?\nTHEY TALK ABOUT THROWING HER IN JAIL AND BRINGING OUT BILL'S\nACCUSERS AND CALLING HER THE DEVIL.\nCAN THEY SUSTAIN THIS FOR 29 MORE DAYS AND WHO IS EMBRACING\nTHIS? >> AT SOME POINT YOU HAVE TO\nTELL PEOPLE WHY THEIR FUTURE WILL BE BETTER IF YOU ARE\nELECTED. WHAT DOES UNITE THE BRANCHES OF\nTHE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS A FEAR OF A CLINTON AGENDA FOR FOUR\nYEARS. WHAT PAUL RYAN DID TODAY IS\nREALLY TO SAY THAT THE FOUR-YEAR AGENDA WITH HILLARY CLINTON AS\nPRESIDENT, YOU NEED BUMPERS FOR THAT.\nTHE COMMONALITY BETWEEN THE PARTY IS THAT UNCHECKED POWER IS\nA VERY, VERY BAD THING. THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE WILL\nDEAL WITH THEIR RAISES. >> WITH THE \"WALL STREET\nJOURNAL\" POLL, 52% OF REPUBLICANS SUPPORTERS OF DONALD\nTRUMP SAID THEIR SUPPORT IS BASED ON THEIR DESPISING HILLARY\nCLINTON RATHER THAN THEIR SUPPORT OF DONALD TRUMP.\nWHO DOES FOR THE FOLKS IN THE MIDDLE AND THE PEOPLE ARE THE\nDIFFERENCE BETWEEN WINNING OVER THE BASE AND MOVING INTO THE\nWHITE HOUSE, WHAT ARE THEY THINKING RIGHT NOW FOR PURSUING\nTHOSE PEOPLE? >> THEY ARE INCLUDING A SENSE OF\nDEJA VU AS WE SEE THE NUMBERS BOUNCING BACK FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON THE WAY SHE APPEARS TO BE TAKING MORE OF A COMMANDING\nLEAD NOW. RIGHT NOW DONALD TRUMP SHOULD BE\nREACHING OUT ALREADY TO THE SWING VOTERS IN THE MIDDLE OF\nTHE UNDECIDEDS OR UNCOMMITTED. THEY ARE TRYING TO REBUILD HIS\nBASE BECAUSE OF THE RECENT CONTROVERSY OVER THE LAST FEW\nDAYS. THAT DOESN'T LEAVE HIM MUCH TIME\nAND I CAN SEE WHY PAUL RYAN IS TRYING TO LEAVE THE REST OF THE\nPARTY TO GUARD THE POSITIONS. THEY HAVE SHOWN VERY SHORT COAT\nTAIL FIST ANY FOR DONALD TRUMP. THEY HAVE A GOOD SHOT AT\nMAINTAINING REPUBLICAN CONTROL AND ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THIS\nAFTERNOON WAS IS THE RNC HOLDING THE CONFERENCE THE SAME WAY PAUL\nRYAN HAS WON. YOU WERE SPEAKING THAT THEY SAID\nIT IS IN FULL COORDINATION AND IT WASN'T CLEAR THAT THAT WOULD\nBE THE CONCLUSION. >> HERE'S THE PRACTICAL REALITY\nOF THAT. THE RNC MONEY AT THIS STAGE\nBECAUSE OF THE FUND-RAISING IS TRUMP MONEY.\nIF THE RNC DOESN'T HAVE MUCH OF AN INDEPENDENT FUND-RAISES BASE,\nALL THE GROUND GAMES THAT YOU ARE SEEING IS MUCH MORE\nGENERATED BY THE HOUSE AND SENATE CANDIDATE AND SOME STATES\nTHERE IS MORE COORDINATION THAN OTHERS.\n>> LOOK AT THE EFFECT. AT 38% IN THE RACE.\n35% HERE. >> FOUR POINTS AND 11 POINTS.\n>> THAT IS THE MARGIN THAT THEY CAN'T MAKE UP IN SWING STATES.\nHE COULD LOSE BY POINTS IN PENNSYLVANIA AND PAT TOOMEY\nMIGHT BE ABLE TO WIN THE SENATE RACE, IF HE IS THAT LOW, THAT IS\nA CHASM FOR CANDIDATES IN SWING STATES.\n>> THE REPUBLICAN PARTY SURVIVES THIS?\n>> YES, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY SURVIVES IT AND WILL SURVIVE IN\nSTRONGER POSITIONS DEPENDING ON THE ELECTORAL RESULTS, BUT THERE\nARE PRINCIPALED CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS ON ALL THE DOWN\nBALLOT RACES. >> STAY WITH US.\nWE WILL BE BACK TO YOU AND WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE RACES A\nLITTLE BIT AND NEW ADS HITTING THE CANDIDATES WITH DONALD\nTRUMP'S OWN WORDS.

IN 2012, MORE OF ROMNEY'S VOTERS\nSAID THEY WERE AGAINST OBAMA THAN THEY WERE FOR HIM.\nYOU KNOW HOW THAT ONE WOUND UP. THE SAME WAS TRUE FOR JOHN KERRY\nIN 2004. OBVIOUSLY, THAT WAS A LOST.\nIN 2008, BOTH CANDIDATES HAD MORE PEOPLE VOTING FOR THEM\nRATHER THAN AGAINST THEIR OPPONENT, BUT 81% OF OBAMA'S\nSUPPORTERS WERE VOTING FOR HIM, AND THAT TRUMPED'S McCAIN'S 61%.\nTHE BOTTOM LINE, THE ANGER THAT TRUMP'S VOTERS FEEL FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON IS LIKELY NOT GOING TO HELP TRUMP WIN THE WHITE HOUSE\nUNLESS SOMETHING CHANGES VERY QUICKLY.\nTHAT'S ALL FOR TONIGHT. WE'RE GOING TO BE BACK TOMORROW\nWITH MORE \"P DAILY.\" \"WITH ALL DUE RESPECT\" BEGINS\nRIGHT NOW. \u00e2\u0099\u00aa IT'S CRAZY \u00e2\u0099\u00aa\n\u00e2\u0099\u00aa IT'S CRAZY \u00e2\u0099\u00aa",

WELCOME BACK TO \"HARDBALL.\"\nANYWAY, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY SEEMS ON THE VERGE OF OPEN CIVIL\nWAR TONIGHT OVER ITS PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE, WITH\nSPEAKER PAUL RYAN NOW SAYING HE WILL NO LONGER DEFEND DONALD\nTRUMP NOR SHOW UP WITH HIM IN ANY SITUATION FOR POLITICS.\nIT COMES AFTER DOZENS OF CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS\nABANDONED THEIR NOMINEE DURING THE MOST TUMULTUOUS WEEKEND IN\nTRUMP'S CAMPAIGN, AS OF YET. WELL, DONALD TRUMP'S DEBATE\nPERFORMANCE LAST NIGHT ONLY CREATED MORE UNCERTAINTY.\nHOW DOES THE REPUBLICAN PARTY NAVIGATE THE FINAL FOUR WEEKS OF\nTHIS CAMPAIGN. I'M JOINED WITH TONIGHT'S\nROUNDTABLE. MOLLY BALZ IS A STAFF WRITER FOR\nTHE ATLANTIC. ANDREW SULLIVAN IS CONTRIBUTING\nEDITOR FOR \"NEW YORK\" MAGAZINE, AND ELY STOEGELS IS A REPORTER\nFOR POLITICO. SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS, HERE\nARE WE GOING FROM HERE, ELY? WE'RE IN THE STRETCH.\n>> STRAIGHT TO THE BOTTOM. I THINK THERE'S LIBERATION FOR\nDONALD TRUMP AFTER A TWO-WEEK FREE FALL, AND AFTER THE SCANDAL\nHE'S BEEN IN AND SEEING THE EROSION OF SUPPORT OVER THE\nWEEKEND. THERE'S LIBERATION.\nHE'S FREE OF A LOT OF THESE BURDENS.\nNOT LIKE HE WAS EVER -- >> FREE BECAUSE HE KNOWS HE\nCAN'T WIN? >> NOW HE'S PLAYING THE BILL\nCLINTON CARD. I THINK THAT'S PART OF IT.\nHE'S IN THE BUNKER, YOU SAW A VERY BREITBARTY DEBATE LAST\nNIGHT. SO HE'S IN THIS BUNKER RIGHT\nNOW, AND WHEN HE'S ATTACKED, HE ATTACKS BACK, AND I THINK WHAT'S\nTHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE. >> BREITBART, BANNON --\n>> YEAH, RIGHT-WING, FRINGE, CONSPIRACY THEORY STUFF.\nAND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE.\nHE SAYS IF SHE WANTS TO GO THERE AND THERE ARE MORE TAPES\nRELEASED, I'LL KEEP BRINGING UP JUANITA BRODERICK, PAULA\nJONES -- >> THIS COULD GO BACK TO THE\nCLINTON CHRONICLES. WE COULD BE BACK WITH THE MURDER\nCHARGES. >> ISN'T THIS THE WORST FOR THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY. >> I DON'T THINK WE'VE EVER SEEN\nA GUY REALIZE UNLESS HE THROWS EVERYTHING AT THE OPPONENT, HE\nDOESN'T HAVE A PRAYER OF SURVIVING WITH DIGNITY.\nI THINK THIS IS TRUMP'S EFFORT TO MAINTAIN SOMETHING.\n>> HE NEEDS TO ATTACK. WHEN HE'S FEELING VULNERABLE,\nTHE ONLY WAY -- HE CAN'T ACKNOWLEDGE ERROR.\nHE CAN'T BE CALM AND SIT AND REFLECT.\nHE HAS TO DOUBLE DOWN AND INCREASE THE ATTACKS ON THE\nOTHER PERSON. FOR MORE, IT SEEMS LIKE THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY HAS THE WORST OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS.\nIF HE WAS REALLY FLAMING OUT LAST NIGHT, PENCE COULD STEP IN\nOR THERE COULD BE SOME MOMENT IN WHICH THEY COULD FIX THIS.\nBUT LAST NIGHT WHAT HE DID WAS REALLY SHORE UP HIS BASE, REALLY\nWELL. I MEAN, IF YOU'RE FOR TRUMP,\nLAST NIGHT MUST HAVE FELT EUPHORIC.\nBECAUSE ALL THOSE THINGS YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO SAY TO HER\nFACE, FINALLY -- >> YOUR FACE RIGHT NOW, YOU'RE\nSIMULATING IT, IT'S THE HATRED OF HILLARY, THE HATRED OF BILL,\nTHE HATRED OF THE DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT, THE\nHATRED OF ALL THE CULTURAL LEADERS.\nAND HERE'S A GUY JUST THROWING CRAP AT THEM FOR AN HOUR AND A\nHALF. >> AND IF YOU DESPISE THE ELITES\nIN THIS COUNTRY, IF YOU DESPISE THE MODERATORS IN THE MEDIA, IF\nYOU DESPISE REPUBLICANS, THIS WAS FANTASTIC FOR THEM.\nHE REALLY SOLIDIFIED HIS BASE. BUT FOR THOSE SWING VOTERS AND\nFOR THE REPUBLICANS IN THOSE SWING SEATS, THIS IS A\nNIGHTMARE. >> CHARLIE DENT FROM LEHIGH\nVALLEY, WHEN I HEARD HIM, I GO, I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.\nHE'S THE BELLWETHER. THAT IS THE SWING PART OF\nPENNSYLVANIA THAT IS THE KEY STATE THAT TRUMP NEEDS TO WIN\nWITH. AND IT'S NOT A GOOD SIGN THAT HE\nDROPPED OFF YESTERDAY. >> THE PROBLEM IS THAT NOT ONLY\nIS TRUMP GINNING UP THE BASE AT THE EXPENSE OF ALL OF THE\nPOTENTIAL PERSUADABLE VOTERS, HE'S GINNING THEM UP AGAINST THE\nESTABLISHMENT. HE'S PRACTICALLY ENCOURAGING\nREPUBLICAN-BASED VOTERS TO VOTE AGAINST THE DOWN-TICKET\nREPUBLICANS. >> IS HE FORMING A NEW POLITICAL\nPARTY? >> I HAVE NO IDEA.\nI HAVE >> I HAVE NO IDEA.\nI HAVE A FIRM POLICY OF NEVER PREDICTING WHAT DONALD TRUMP\nWILL DO NEXT. >> IT'S NOT TO JOIN THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY. >> THAT'S RIGHT.\nYOU'RE GIVING ME AN INCREDIBLY PROFOUND LOOK.\nTHE ROUNDTABLE IS STICKING WITH US.\nTHIS IS \"HARDBALL,\" THE PLACE FOR POLITICS.",

I'M CHRIS HAYES.\nAT THIS MOMENT, BOTH DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON ARE\nHOLDING EVENTS, THE FIRST AFTER LAST NIGHT'S DEBATE.\nNOW, DONALD TRUMP'S JOB LAST NIGHT WAS TO ATTEMPT TO WIPE\nAWAY THE EFFECTS OF THE SHOCKING VIDEO WHICH HE BRAGS THAT HE CAN\nSEXUALLY ASSAULT WOMEN BECAUSE HE'S FAMOUS IN THE PROCESS KEEP\nHIS PARTY FROM ABANDONING HIM AND REVERSE HIS SLIDE IN THE\nPOLLS. TRUMP BY ALL ACCOUNTS FAILED IN\nTHAT MISSION AND TODAY WE LEARNED THAT THINGS ARE EVEN\nWORSE FOR HIM THAN THEY SEEMED. A NEW POLL TAKEN THIS WEEKEND\nAFTER THE TRUMP TAPE DROPPED BUT BEFORE THE DEBATE SHOWS TRUMP\nTRAILING HILLARY CLINTON BY 11 POINTS AMONG LIKELY VOTERS IN A\nFOUR-WAY RACE WITH TRUMP GETTING JUST 35% OF THE VOTE.\nCLINTON NEARLY DOUBLED HER LEAD OVER TRUMP COMPARED TO THE SAME\nPOLL LAST MONTH AND HER BIG LEAD IS EVEN BIGGER.\nWITH CLINTON LEADING TRUMP BY A WHOPPING 14 POINTS IN A TWO-WAY\nRACE. THIS IS JUST ONE POLL AND IT WAS\nTAKEN DURING A VERY TUMULTUOUS PERIOD DURING THE RACE.\nNUMBERS LIKE THAT PRETEND NOT JUST A MASS TIF SIF TRUMP LOST\nBUT A DISASTER FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN THE EFFORTS\nTO HOLD THE SENATE AND EVEN MAINTAIN THE HOUSE.\nTHIS MORNING, MIKE PENCE WITH ALL OF THE SINCERITY OF A MEMBER\nTOUTING THE PARTY'S VISION TRIED TO CAST IT AS A TURNING POINT\nWITH TRUMP PUTTING FRIDAY'S TAPE BEHIND HIM.\n>> LAST NIGHT, MY RUNNING MATE, HE SHOWED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\nHIS HEART. HE SHOWED HUME MILT TO THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE AND THEN HE FOUGHT BACK AND TURNED THE FOCUS\nTO THE CHOICE THAT WE FACE AND I'M PROUD TO STAND WITH DONALD\nTRUMP! >> BUT THOSE WHO AREN'T ON THE\nTICKET ARE COMING TO A VERY DIFFERENT CONCLUSION.\nAFTER MORE THAN 25 PROMINENT REPUBLICANS CALLED ON TRUMP TO\nDROP OUT OVER THE WEEKEND AND AT LEAST 20 MORE SAID THEY WEREN'T\nVOTING FOR TRUMP TODAY, THE MOST POWERFUL REPUBLICAN IN THE\nCOUNTRY, HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN, SAYS HE WILL NOT DEFEND\nTRUMP OR CAMPAIGN WITH HIM GOING FORWARD AND INSTRUCT THE MEMBERS\nTO, QUOTE, DO WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU AND YOUR DISTRICT.\nRYAN IS NOT, TO BE CLEAR, RESCINDING HIS ENDORSEMENT.\nAS CLINTON NOTED TODAY, RYAN IS STILL ENDORSING DONALD TRUMP\nWHILE EFFECTIVELY CONCEDING THAT HE'S NOT A PERSON HE WANTS TO\nSTAND NEXT TO AND ALSO THAT TRUMP CANNOT WIN.\nA STANCE THAT SATISFIES PRECISELY NO ONE.\nON A CONFERENCE CALL THIS MORNING, RYAN FACED ANGRY BLOW\nBACK FROM CONSERVATIVE LAWMAKERS SUPPORT TIF OF TRUMP ONE SAYING\nTHAT RYAN AND THE GOP LEADERSHIP WERE ACTING COWARDLY.\nPRO-TRUMP PROTESTERS GATHERING OUTSIDE OF THE RNC TO DEMAND THE\nPARTY STAND BEHIND TRUMP, PROMPTING TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN TO\nFIRE COREY STEWART FOR ORGANIZING THAT PROTEST.\nTRUMP HIMSELF SENDING A HIGH INSIDE IN THE DIRECTION OF\nRYAN'S CHIN TWEETING, \"PAUL RYAN SHOULD SPEND MORE TIME ON BALL\nBALANCE THE BUDGET AND NOT FIGHTING THE REPUBLICAN\nNOMINEE.\" AND THE DEBATE WAS WATCHED BY\nMORE THAN 66 MILLION PEOPLE. TRUMP GAVE THEM RED MEAT ON\nISSUES LIKE BENGHAZI, DISMISSING HIS SEXUAL ASSAULT BOASTS AS\nLOCKER ROOM TALK, BELITTLING HILLARY CLINTON AND IF ELECTED\nPROMISING TO THROW HER IN JAIL. TRUMP WENT SO FAR TODAY TO SAY\nTHAT HE TURNED THE STORY ABOUT HIS MISTREATMENT OF WOMEN BACK\nON CLINTON AND THREATEN THAT HE WOULD KEEP PUSHING THAT LINE.\n>> I WAS GETTING BEATEN UP FOR 72 HOURS ON ALL THE NETWORKS FOR\nINAPPROPRIATE WORDS 12 YEARS AGO, LOCKER ROOM TALK, WHATEVER\nYOU WANT TO CALL IT, BUT I SAID TO MYSELF, WAIT A MINUTE, AND I\nJUST SAW A VERY INAPPROPRIATE WORDS BUT BILL CLINTON SEXUALLY\nASSAULTED INNOCENT WOMEN AND HILLARY CLINTON ATTACKED THOSE\nWOMEN VICIOUSLY. ONE OF THEM SAID MORE VICIOUSLY\nTHAN HE ATTACKED THEM. IF THEY WANT TO RELEASE MORE\nTAPES SAYING INAPPROPRIATE THINGS, WE'LL CONTINUE TO TALK\nABOUT BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON DOING INAPPROPRIATE THINGS.\nTHERE ARE SO MANY OF THEM, FOLKS.\n>> WE SHOULD BE VERY CLEAR THAT THOSE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE\nFORMER PRESIDENT ARE NOT SUBSTANTIATED AND DENIED\nSTRONGLY BY THE FORMER PRESIDENT AND THE ALLEGATIONS ABOUT\nHILLARY CLINTON'S MISTREATMENT ARE ALSO DENIED.\nWHILE THIS PLAYS FOR THE SORT OF PEOPLE THAT SHOW UP THE TRUMP'S\nRALLY, IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT WINS OVER UNDECIDED VOTERS, INCLUDING\nWOMEN VOTERS. ALL OF THIS LEAVES REPUBLICAN\nPOLITICIANS WITH TWO UNAPPEALING OPTIONS.\nEITHER STAND WITH TRUMP AND DEFEND THE INDEFENSIBLE.\nJOINING ME NOW POLITICAL ANALYST MICHAEL STEELE, FORMER CHAIR OF\nTHE RNC. THERE'S NEW REPORTING SORT OF\nWHAT IS GOING ON BEHIND THE SCENES AT THE RNC.\nI SHOULD NOTE, FORMER RNC CHAIRMAN BEGINNING TO TAKE ON\nLEGENDARY STATURE THE MORE THIS GOES ON IN TERMS OF YOUR RESUME.\nWHAT IS THE STATE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY INSTITUTIONALLY\nAT THIS MOMENT? >> IT IS BACK UP AGAINST THE\nWALL, IT'S CAUGHT BETWEEN ITS BASE, ITS NOMINEE AND ITS\nPOLITICAL LEADERSHIP ON THE HILL AND THAT IS NOT A SAFE PLACE TO\nOCCUPY IN BECAUSE YOU HAVE AN ELECTION IN 30 DAYS, A BASE\nTHAT'S BECOMING MORE AND MORE DISGRUNTLED, THOSE WHO ARE\nSUPPORTING TRUMP, THOSE WHO ARE TICKED OFF AT HIM.\nYOU'VE GOT LEADERSHIP ON THE HILL AND AROUND THE COUNTRY,\nGOVERNORS AND MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND STATE LEGISLATORS\nWHO ARE BACKING AWAY AND YOU HAVE A DEFIANT NOMINEE.\nSO IN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION, IT'S ALL UPSIDE DOWN CRAZY RIGHT\nNOW AND THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT THE INSTITUTION CAN DO ABOUT IT.\nTHIS IS GOING TO PLAY ITSELF OUT, CHRIS, IN LARGE MEASURE\nBECAUSE DONALD TRUMP HOLDS THE CARDS.\nAND AS LONG AS HE HOLDS THE CARDS, AND HE HAS AND NO ONE CAN\nTAKE THEM AWAY FROM HIM, IT'S GOING TO PLAY ITSELF OUT THE WAY\nIT IS. >> WHAT DO YOU HEAR ABOUT THAT\nIN TERMS OF HE IS NOT DEPENDENT UPON THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN ANY\nWAY? >> THAT'S RIGHT.\n>> THERE ARE NO INCENTIVES OR CORRECTIVES FOR A LIFELONG\nPOLITICIAN OR AT LEAST LIFELONG REPUBLICAN PROFESSIONAL WHO\nWANTS TO CONTINUE TO BE IN THE PARTY, HE DOESN'T CARE.\n>> DOESN'T CARE. AND WHAT THREAT DO YOU HOLDOVER\nHIS HEAD? YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE THE\nNOMINATION AWAY FROM HIM? NO, YOU'RE NOT, BECAUSE THE\nRULES ONLY ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN IF HE DIES OR RESIGNS.\nIS YOUR RUNNING MATE, YOU'RE GOING TO CONVINCE YOUR RUNNING\nMATE -- HIS RUNNING MATE TO STEP DOWN?\nNO. MIKE PENCE HAS A POLITICAL\nFUTURE AND HE'S KIND OF STUCK WHERE HE IS.\nTHERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT THAT THE PARTY CAN DO AT THIS POINT\nEXCEPT TO CAJOLE, PLEAD AND HOPE THAT DONALD TRUMP SORT OF DIALS\nDOWN THE NOISE AROUND HILLARY CLINTON AND ALL OF THAT SCANDAL\nAND FOCUS ON THE ISSUES THAT ARE WINNABLE ISSUES WITH THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE. SEE, THAT'S THE OTHER SIDE OF\nTHIS COIN, CHRIS, THAT IS SO FRUSTRATING FOR A LOT OF FOLKS\nOUT THERE. THERE ARE LEGITIMATE POLICY\nISSUES THAT YOU COULD TAKE TO HILLARY CLINTON AND WIN THIS\nELECTION ON. BUT THAT'S NOT HOW THIS IS\nPLAYING ITSELF OUT RIGHT NOW. >> YOU KNOW WHAT, THE MOST\nINTERESTING THING TO ME ABOUT THAT IS THAT THE ISSUES WHERE HE\nSEEMS TO HAVE THE MOST RESONANCE ARE THEMSELVES ALSO DEEPLY AND\nSUBSTAN TIFLY DRK THE BORDER WALL TOUGH ON IMMIGRATION\nANTI-TRADE DEAL PACKAGE IS A POWERFUL MESSAGE.\n>> RIGHT. >> THAT WAS NOT THE REPUBLICAN\nPARTY MESSAGE. >> RIGHT.\n>> NOR IS ALIGNED WITH ASSAD AND RUSSIA ON SYRIA'S MESSAGE.\n>> RIGHT. BUT SOME OF THAT -- PART OF THAT\nMESSAGE THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS CREATED HAS OPENED UP A NEW\nSPACE FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH A\nLOT OF AMERICANS THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN SHUT OFF FROM,\nPARTICULARLY ON ISSUES LIKE TRADE.\n>> YEAH. >> SO THE PROBLEM IS\nADAPTABILITY. THE PARTY HAS YET TO ADAPT TO\nTHIS NEW ENVIRONMENT. >> IT JUST FEELS LIKE IT DOESN'T\nKNOW WHAT IT IS. >> THEY KNOW WHAT THE HELL IT\nIS. THIS ISN'T NEW.\nTHIS HAS BEEN BREWING SINCE REAGAN TOOK OFFICE.\nTHESE CHANGES SOCIALLY, ECONOMICALLY, POLITICALLY IN\nAREAS OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, THIS HAS ALL BEEN CHANGING UNDERNEATH\nOUR FEET FOR A LONG TIME. WE HAVE JUST NOT BOTHERED TO\nLOOK AND SEE WHAT IT IS AND HOW WE STEP INTO THAT SPACE IN A NEW\nWAY. THAT'S ALL.\n>> THE PROBLEM IS THIS IS THE GUY DOING THE STEPPING RIGHT\nNOW. >> YEAH.\nTHAT'S ESSENTIALLY RIGHT. >> MICHAEL STEELE, THANKS FOR\nYOUR TIME. APPRECIATE IT.\n>> ALL RIGHT, BUDDY.",

WITH 29 DAYS TO GO, DONALD TRUMP\nIS CLEARLY GOING TO TOUGH IT OUT, FACING A LOT OF DEFECTIONS\nAND HIS CAMPAIGN TAKING A NEGATIVE TURN JUST AN HOUR\nBEFORE A DEBATE WITH HILLARY CLINTON'S FORMER ACCUSERS.\nTHEY ALSO STARTED A CONFRONTATION WITH THE FORMER\nPRESIDENT WHICH WAS DIVERTED BY THE OFFICIALS IN THE DEBATE\nITSELF. IN THE DEBATE ITSELF, CLINTON\nCALLED HIM A LIAR. HE CALLED HER THE DEVIL AT ONE\nPOINT, SAYING IF HE HAD HIS WAY, SHE WOULD BE IN JAIL.\nWE KNOW ALL THAT. A NEW POLL SHOWS THE PEOPLE KNOW\nTHAT, TOO. IT SHOWS THAT THE BOTTOM COULD\nBE FALLING OUT OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.\nCATCH THESE NUMBERS. THE LATEST NBC WALL STREET\nJOURNAL POLL FINDS THAT CLINTON HAS JUMPED TO AN 11-POINT LEAD,\nDOUBLE DIGITS OVER TRUMP, LIKELY VOTERS IN A FOUR-WAY RACE.\nCLINTON WITH 46, TRUMP WITH 35. JOHNSON WITH JUST 9%.\nBUT TRUMP TODAY DOUBLED DOWN ON HIS ATTACKS OF FORMER PRESIDENT\nBILL CLINTON, THREATENED TO GO EVEN FURTHER IF MORE DAMAGING\nTAPES ON HIM ARE MADE PUBLIC. LET'S WATCH.\n>> BILL CLINTON SEXUALLY ASSAULTED INNOCENT WOMEN, AND\nHILLARY CLINTON ATTACKED THOSE WOMEN VICIOUSLY.\nONE OF THEM SAID MORE VICIOUSLY THAN HE ATTACKED THEM.\nIF THEY WANT TO RELEASE MORE TAPES SAYING INAPPROPRIATE\nTHINGS, WE'LL CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON\nDOING INAPPROPRIATE THINGS.

LOUIS.\n[ CHEERS ] >> AND HONESTLY, IT WAS BOTH\nVERY BEAUTIFUL AND VERY SAD. >> WOW.\nHE'S POETIC. IN A CONFERENCE CALL WITH\nREPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS TODAY, HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN SAID HE\nWOULD NO LONGER DEFEND NOR CAMPAIGN FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nA REPUBLICAN, INSTEAD RYAN SAID HE WANTS TO FOCUS ON THE\nREPUBLICANS BEING THE MAJORITY. TRUMP TODAY TWEETED, PAUL RYAN\nSHOULD SPEND MORE TIME ON BALANCING THE BUDGET, JOBS AND\nILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND NOT WASTE HIS TIME ON FIGHTING THE\nREPUBLICAN NOMINEE. WELL, THE MESSAGE FOR THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY ITSELF TODAY COULDN'T BE\nCLEARER. YOU'RE EITHER WITH US OR AGAINST\nUS, EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF. CHAIRMAN OF THE AMERICAN\nCONSERVATIVE UNION, AND CARL BELCHER IS AUTHOR OF A NEW BOOK\n\"A BLACK MAN IN THE WHITE HOUSE.\"\nCAN YOU TELL IF THESE NUMBERS ARE OUTLYERS?\nAN 11-POINT SPREAD FOR HILLARY. THAT'S HARD TO COME UP WITH.\n>> IF YOU LOOK AT IT, CHRIS, SHE'S GOT THE BIG ADVANTAGE\nAMONG WOMEN, BUT HIS LEAD AMONG MEN IS SHRINKING.\nHE'S ALWAYS MADE THIS THING THAT HE'S THE LEADER AMONG MEN.\nHIS LEAD AMONG MEN IS NOW ONLY TWO OR THREE POINTS.\nIT'S CONTINUING TO SLIDE AND HEAD IN THE OTHER DIRECTION.\n>> JUST TO GO BY GENDER HERE BECAUSE OF THE SEXUAL NATURE OF\nALL THIS STUFF THAT'S COME OUT, IS HE DOING EVEN AS WELL AS MITT\nROMNEY OR JOHN McCAIN? >> SHE'S WITHIN TWO OR THREE\nPOINTS WITH MEN. I'LL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW, IF\nOBAMA WAS WITHIN TWO OR THREE POINTS WITH MEN, IT WOULD HAVE\nBEEN A LANDSLIDE. THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR JOHN\nKERRY. RIGHT NOW THE MAJORITY OF VOTERS\nSAY THEY'RE VOTING AGAINST HER, NOT NECESSARILY AGAINST HIM.\nTHEY'RE VOTING FOR HER. >> KEEP TRASHING THE CLINTONS IS\nHIS STRATEGY.

TRUMP GAVE THEM RED MEAT ON\nISSUES LIKE BENGHAZI, DISMISSING HIS SEXUAL ASSAULT BOASTS AS\nLOCKER ROOM TALK, BELITTLING HILLARY CLINTON AND IF ELECTED\nPROMISING TO THROW HER IN JAIL. TRUMP WENT SO FAR TODAY TO SAY\nTHAT HE TURNED THE STORY ABOUT HIS MISTREATMENT OF WOMEN BACK\nON CLINTON AND THREATEN THAT HE WOULD KEEP PUSHING THAT LINE.\n>> I WAS GETTING BEATEN UP FOR 72 HOURS ON ALL THE NETWORKS FOR\nINAPPROPRIATE WORDS 12 YEARS AGO, LOCKER ROOM TALK, WHATEVER\nYOU WANT TO CALL IT, BUT I SAID TO MYSELF, WAIT A MINUTE, AND I\nJUST SAW A VERY INAPPROPRIATE WORDS BUT BILL CLINTON SEXUALLY\nASSAULTED INNOCENT WOMEN AND HILLARY CLINTON ATTACKED THOSE\nWOMEN VICIOUSLY. ONE OF THEM SAID MORE VICIOUSLY\nTHAN HE ATTACKED THEM.

SEE, THAT'S THE OTHER SIDE OF\nTHIS COIN, CHRIS, THAT IS SO FRUSTRATING FOR A LOT OF FOLKS\nOUT THERE. THERE ARE LEGITIMATE POLICY\nISSUES THAT YOU COULD TAKE TO HILLARY CLINTON AND WIN THIS\nELECTION ON.

SO ANYWAY, LET ME ASK YOU THIS,\nJOHN HEILEMANN, THIS DOES MATTER AS FAR AS THIS LATEST BLOWUP BY\nTRUMP, EVEN IF LET'S SAY THINGS ARE LEVEL A WEEK FROM NOW?\nIT MATTERS NOW BECAUSE IN FLORIDA AND OTHER IMPORTANT\nSTATES, VOTING HAS BEGUN. SO ACTUALLY --\n>> NOW I GET IT. >> THEY'RE SAYING JULY WHERE YOU\nCAN GO, WELL, HE'S GOT TIME. THIS MATTERS BECAUSE --\n>> YEAH. >> PEOPLE ARE VOTING RIGHT NOW.\n>> OKAY. >> YEAH.\nI MEAN -- >> THANK YOU.\n>> YES. >> YOU MEAN IN MATTERS IN TERMS\nOF TAKING THE POLL AT THAT MOMENT AS CAPTURING WHAT'S GOING\nON IN TERMS OF VOTING. >> IT'S MORE WE'RE AT THE POINT\nIT'S A SNAPSHOT IN TIME. IT'S MORE THAN A MOMENT IN TIME.\n>> IT'S HAPPENING. >> PEOPLE ARE VOTING RIGHT NOW.\n>> AND LOOK, I DON'T HAVE THE OBJECTION YOU HAVE.\nI'M INTERESTED IN SEEING POLLS, I'M INTERESTED IN THAT SNAPSHOT\nOF TOP BETWEEN THE SCANDAL AND DEBATE AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE\nPLENTY OF POLLING SHOWING THE EFFECT OF THE DEBATE WAS.\nI'M HAPPY TO SEE A SERIES OF SNAPSHOTS.\n>> WE DIDN'T HAVE ONE FOR 18 MONTHS BEFORE.\nI EXAGGERATE. A WEEK AND A HALF AFTER A\nDEBATE. >> YEAH.\n>> SO WHAT ARE YOU THINK AS FAR AS THIS LEAD?\nWHAT ARE ALL THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS IT'S GOING TO HAVE ON\nTRUMP FROM FUND-RAISING TO EARLY VOTING TO ORGANIZING?\nA LOT OF PEOPLE OUT LAST NIGHT CHEERING HIM ON, BUT WHAT'S THE\nLONG-TERM IMPACT? >> IT ALWAYS COMES BACK TO HALLE\nBARBER, GOOD GETS BETTER AND BAD GETS WORSE.\nTHE STORIES ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON LATEST DISCLOSURES OF\nTHE E-MAILS WOULD BE NEGATIVE STORIES.\nCAMPAIGNING WITH AL GORE COULD BE COVERED IN A FRAUGHT,\nNEGATIVE WAY, INSTEAD HE IS JUST BEHIND THE 8 BALL NOW EVERY DAY\nAND EVERY NEWS CYCLE THROUGH THE PRISM NOT NOW THE TAPE, FIRST\nTHE VIDEO, AND NOW OF THE POLLS. >> YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW IF\nHALLY BARBER SAID IT BUT SHOULD HAVE SAID IT, ANOTHER VICTIM I\nGO BY YOU'RE NEVER AS BAD AS THEY SAY ARE YOU, AND NEVER AS\nGOOD AS YOU THINK YOU ARE. >> HALEY BARBOUR IN CONFLICT IN\nTWO EXPRESSIONS. >> THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS.\n>> I THINK IN THIS CASE IT'S THE SECOND HALEY BARBOUR.\nI BELIEVE, I COULD BE TOTALLY WRONG, I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO\nSEE A BOUNCEBACK OF TRUMP. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE 14 POINTS.\nIT'S NOT. IT'S GOING TO GET TIGHTER --\n>> BUT IT COULD BE 7 POINTS. >> BUT IT WON'T BE 14.\n>> RIGHT. >> HE NEEDS TO CHANGE THE\nDYNAMIC OF THE RACE. >> WELL, HE IS.\n>> YES. >> ONE OF THE MORE --\n>> HE HAS. >> ONE OF THE MORE INTERESTING\nQUESTIONS YOU COULD ASK IN THE POLL THAT HAS NOT BEEN ASKED IS\nTHE FOLLOWING QUESTION, WOULD YOU BE HAPPY OR UNHAPPY, IF THE\nELECTION WERE OVER TODAY? AND I SUSPECT HAPPY WOULD WIN 80\nTO 90% OF THOSE POLLS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SICK OF BOTH OF THESE\nCANDIDATES AND THEY ARE TRULY SICK OF THIS CAMPAIGN.\n>> YEAH. >> TRULY SICK OF IT.\n>> THE DYNAMIC OF THE RACE THAT IS H\nBENEFIT. >> IT'S USIDE.\n>> I WAS WITH HIM YESTERDAY. I KNOW WE WILL DISAGREE HOW HE\nPERFORMED IN THE DEBATE SUNDAY NIGHT BUT EVERYTHING HE'S DONE\nIN THE LAST 48 HOURS HAS BEEN LIKE HE'S JUST CAMPAIGNING FOR\n35% OF AMERICA. >> YEAH.\n>> I MEAN HE'S RUNNING A BASE CAMPAIGN RIGHT NOW TO MAKE -- TO\nGET PEOPLE WHO LOVE HIM ALREADY TO SHAKE THEIR FISTS.\n>> AGAIN, YOU HAVE TO -- >> HE'S --\n>> WE HAVE TO KEEPS THIS IN PERSPECTIVE.\nON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY, HE WAS A POLITICAL EQUIVALENT OF DEAD ON\nARRIVAL. >> RIGHT.\n>> THEY FOUND HIM IN A DITCH ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND\nEVERYBODY SAID, HE'S NOT GOING TO MAKE IT.\n>> EVERYONE WAS SAYING -- >> HE'S DEAD.\nA DOCTOR SAID, WE CAN REMAKE HIM.\nWE CAN MAKE HIM THE 6 MILLION DOLLAR MAN.\nNO. BUT HIS CAMPAIGN WAS DEAD.\nAND HE WOULD NOT HAVE SURVIVED UNTIL MONDAY IF HE HAD NOT --\nCHANGED THE DYNAMIC AS YOU SAID. SO RIGHT NOW, 35% FOR A MAN WHO\nWAS DEAD ON FRIDAY, IS NOT A BAD PLACE TO START.\n>> IT'S A SUGAR HIGH. >> IT'S A SUGAR HIGH.\n>> I WANT TO -- >> YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.\nIF YOU'RE ABOUT TO DIE AND YOUR COIS IS, I COULD DIE OR THEY\nCOULD STICK THOSE THINGS ON MY CHEST THAT REALLY HURT, I'M\nGOING TO TAKE THAT RATHER THAN BEING DEAD IN THE DITCH.\nOF COURSE YOU HAVE TO LIVE TO -- HE'S FOUGHT TO LIVE ANOTHER DAY.\nWHAT DOES HE DO WITH IT? >> HE'S CAMPAIGNING LIKE A CRAZY\nPERSON RIGHT NOW. HE'S CAMPAIGNING LIKE A CRAZY\nPERSON HE WALKED OUT YESTERDAY AT THE FIRST EVENT HE DID.\n>> RIGHT. >> OUTSIDE PITTSBURGH THAT I WAS\nAT, IT WAS THE FIRST RALLY SINCE THE REVELATION OF THE TAPES ON\nFRIDAY. HE WALKED OUT ON STAGE AND SPENT\nTHE FIRST FIVE MINUTES OF THE EVENT TALKING ABOUT HOW CLOSE HE\nIS TO BEN ROETHLISBERGER. DONALD TRUMP SPENT THE LAST\nWEEKEND BEING ACCUSED OF CONDONING AND BOASTING ABOUT\nSEXUAL ASSAULT AND CAME OUT ON STAGE AND TALKED ABOUT HOW CLOSE\nHE IS TO BE WITH SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT\nTWICE. >> RIGHT.\n>> WITH A -- SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF RAPE TWICE.\n>> RIGHT. >> THAT'S LUNACY.\nIT'S LUNACY. >> WELL --\n>> IT'S DIFFERENT FROM A LOT OF THINGS.\nTHERE'S NO ONE AT THIS TABLE WHO WOULD SAY THAT'S A SENSIBLE\nTHING FOR SOMEONE TO DO, ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT WALK OUT AND\nBOAST ABOUT THEIR CLOSENESS WITH A SEXUAL ASSAULT PERPETRATOR.\nHE'S NUTS. >> A LOT OF THINGS HE HAS DONE\nOVER THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF HAVE BEEN NUTS.\n>> YES, WELL -- >> HE WON THE REPUBLICAN\nNOMINATION. HIS CAMPAIGN WAS OVER ON FRIDAY.\nIT'S NOT OVER NOW. AND I WANT TO TALK TO MY FRIENDS\nIN ROMPER ROOM LAND I CAN SEE YOU ALL WITH MY MIRROR AND MAKE\nSURE BEFORE YOU START TWEETING REALLY STUPID THINGS THAT WILL\nMAKE MY TEETH HURT, THAT YOU WILL UNDERSTAND, THAT I'M NOT\nCONDONING ANY OF THIS. >> NO.\n>> I'M SAYING HE HAD A CHOICE TO LET HIS CAMPAIGN DIE OR DOES HIS\nCAMPAIGN LIVE AND HE CHOSE TO KEEP HIS CAMPAIGN ALIVE.\nTHAT'S MORALLY REPUGNANT TO YOU. HIS VERY EXISTENCE AS JACK\nNICHOLSON WOULD SAY AT THE END OF \"A FEW GOOD MEN\" IS MORALLY\nREPUGNANT TO YOU, BUT POLITICALLY THE DECISION WAS\nMADE I AM NOT GOING TO QUIT THIS RACE AND THAT'S WHERE DONALD\nTRUMP IS RIGHT NOW. I SUSPECT HE LIVES TO SURVIVE TO\nTHE END OF THE CAMPAIGN AND MAYBE HE LIVES TO SURVIVE WITH A\nVERY HARD CORE 38% OF THE VOTE. >> SO --\n>> BUT HE WOULD RATHER DO THAT THAN BE OUT OF THE RACE IN EARLY\nOCTOBER. >> THE DEPRESSING THING IS, I\nDISAGREE WITH YOU. I THINK HIS CAMPAIGN IS OVER.\nIT WILL CONTINUE. IT WILL CONTINUE.\n>> YEAH. >> BUT THE REASON THAT IT WILL\nCONTINUE IS, HILLARY CLINTON. BECAUSE YOU JUST NEVER KNOW FROM\nDAY TO DAY, I MEAN THE RELEASE OF THESE WIKILEAKS E-MAILS,\nTHERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING THERE ABOUT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN AND\nABOUT THE CANDIDATE HERSELF. >> YEAH.\n>> IN ADDITION TO THE FACT THAT THE OTHER EVENING DURING THE\nDEBATE, THE COMBINED VERBIAGE FROM BOTH OF THEM, DIDN'T ELICIT\nONE INSPIRATIONAL FEELING IN AMERICAN VOTERS.\n>> IT WAS UGLY. >> THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE\nLOOKING FOR IN A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nAND IT'S NOT BEEN THERE. >> SO DONALD TRUMP WAS IN\nPENNSYLVANIA YESTERDAY AND MAYBE HE DID IT THERE.\nNOT REALLY. HE MADE IT CLEAR HE HAD NO\nINTENTION OF BACKING OFF THE PRESSURE THAT HE'S BEEN APPLYING\nON HILLARY CLINTON AND BILL CLINTON.\n>> I WAS GETTING BEATEN UP FOR 72 HOURS ON ALL THE NETWORKS FOR\nINAPPROPRIATE WORDS 12 YEARS AGO, LOCKER ROOM TALK, WHATEVER\nYOU WANT TO CALL IT, BUT I SAID TO MYSELF, WAIT A MINUTE, AND I\nJUST SAW VERY INAPPROPRIATE WORDS, BUT BILL CLINTON SEXUALLY\nASSAULTED INNOCENT WOMEN AND HILLARY CLINTON ATTACKED THOSE\nWOMEN VICIOUSLY. IF THEY WANT TO RELEASE MORE\nTAPES, SAYING INAPPROPRIATE THINGS WE'LL CONTINUE TO TALK\nABOUT BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON DOING INAPPROPRIATE THINGS.\nAS I OUTLINED LAST NIGHT BILL CLINTON WAS THE WORST ABUSER OF\nWOMEN EVER TO SIT IN THE OVAL OFFICE.\nHE WAS A PREDATOR. HILLARY CLINTON SYSTEMICALLY\nATTACKED AND DISCREDITED THE VICTIMS OF BILL CLINTON'S SEXUAL\nHARASSMENT AND ASSAULT. THESE THINGS AREN'T WRITTEN BY\nTHE MEDIA BUT THEY'RE TRUE. FOR DECADES HILLARY CLINTON HAS\nBEEN DEEPLY FAMILIAR WITH HER HUSBAND'S PREDATORY BEHAVIOR AND\nINSTEAD OF TRYING TO STOP IT, SHE MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO\nTAKE ADVANTAGE OF EVEN MORE WOMEN.\nSHE PUT EVEN MORE WOMEN IN HARM'S WAY AND THEN SHE GOES OUT\nAND SAYS, OH, I LOVE WOMEN, I'M GOING TO HELP WOMEN, I'M GOING\nTO HELP WOMEN. SHE'S A TOTAL HYPOCRITE.\nTHE HYPOCRISY OF THE MEDIA AND OUR POLITICS IS HARD TO BELIEVE.\n>> SO THIS IS ALL OFF PROMPTER. IT WAS AMAZING HE WAITED AFTER\nSTARTING WITH HIS BEN ROETHLISBERGER, HE WAITED UNTIL\nTHE END OF THE SPEECH AND WENT TO PROMPTER AND READ IN A MORE\nDETAILED WAY THAN HE DID ON SUNDAY FIGHT WHERE HE LISTED NOT\nJUST THE FOUR WOMEN, BUT A LONG LIST OF EVERYBODY THAT HE --\nTHAT HAD NEGATIVE ASSOCIATION, BILL CLINTON SEXUALLY ABUSED IN\nHIS FRAMING. >> THAT BILL CLINTON -- IT WAS\nLIKE ALLEGEDLY SEXUALLY ABUSED. >> AND HIS FRAMING IS CLINTON IS\nPREDATOR. HE CALLED IT THE DEVIL,\nENCOURAGED EVERYONE TO CHANT LOCKER UP.\nIT WAS -- I MEAN IT WAS THE REDDEST OF RED MEAT SPEECHES.\n>> THIS SPEECH WOULDN'T HELP IT IN PRIMARIES OF PHILLY.\n>> THEY MAY NOT LIKE IT -- >> TALK TO EVERY VOTER THAT\nDOESN'T LOVE HIM. IT WAS A PURELY --\n>> BUT AGAIN, I HATE TO TRY TO ATTACH RATIONALE POLITICAL\nTHOUGHT TO WHAT SEEMS TO BE IRRATIONAL TO ALL OF US IN\nPOLITE SOCIETY, BUT MARK HALPERIN WHAT DID THE RNC DO\nYESTERDAY, WE'RE BEHIND HIM ALL THE WAY, BACKING HIM UP ALL THE\nWAY. REINCE PRIEBUS MADE HIS DECISION\nLONG AGO AND STICKING WITH IT. >> I DON'T KNOW THAT REINCE WAS\nAS SOLID ON FRIDAY NIGHT AS MONDAY.\n>> NOBODY WAS ON FRIDAY. >> EXACTLY.\n>> AND REINCE WASN'T ON FRIDAY NIGHT.\n>> THAT'S THE POINT. MIKE PENCE YESTERDAY, HE'S\nBEHIND HIM. >> RIGHT.\nBUT THERE ARE NOW REPUBLICANS WORRIED ABOUT LOSING THE HOUSE\nBECAUSE OF THE STRATEGY. >> THEY SHOULD BE.\n>> WINNING A THIRD OF THE VOTE AT THE PRESIDENTIAL LEVEL IS --\n>> WHEN DO WE START TALKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY? >> THAT'S WHAT I'M --\n>> WHO THINKS -- I MEAN THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY THING YESTERDAY\nREINCE PRIEBUS WENT ONE WAY AND PAUL RYAN WENT THE OTHER WAY.\n>> PAUL IS STILL ENDORSING HIM. >> YES BUT --\n>> STILL ENDORSING HIM. >> HOW COULD HE.\n>> I UNDERSTAND. TRUST ME I UNDERSTAND THAT.\n>> PAUL RYAN IS ENDORSING FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW,\nPAUL RYAN IS ENDORSING DONALD TRUMP.\nI DON'T KNOW IF YOU GOT THAT WORD.\n>> STILL HOLDING UP THE POSSIBILITY HE WILL WITHDRAW IT.\nLIKE WHEN THE MISSILES ARE FLYING?\n>> WHAT'S IT GOING TO TAKE. >> STILL STOOD UP IN FRONT OF\nHIS MEMBERS AND SAID I WILL NOT DEFEND HIM, NOT CAMPAIGN WITH\nHIM, NOT SAY ANYTHING MORE ABOUT HIM AND ALL OF YOU ARE FREE TO\nDO WHATEVER YOU WANT. PLEASE, SHAVE YOUR OWN SKINS\nNOW. THIS IS THE MOMENT THAT WE REACH\nTWO WEEKS OUT IN 1996 WITH BOB DOLE WHERE THE HIGHEST RANKED\nREPUBLICAN IN THE COUNTRY TURNED TO HIS MEMBERSHIP AND SAID, FEEL\nFREE TO DO WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO THE BECAUSE THE PRESIDENTIAL\nRACE IS OVER. >> WHAT IS INCREDIBLE MIKE\nBARNICLE, IS TEN DAYS AGO, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW THE\nREPUBLICANS LOOKED LIKE THEY HAD A SHOT, 50/50 SHOT OF HOLDING ON\nTO THE SENATE. NOBODY IS SAYING THAT THIS\nMORNING. AND NOW, YOU'RE STARTING TO HEAR\nSERIOUS TALK ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS HAVING A SHOT AT ACTUALLY TAKING\nOVER THE HOUS THAT WOULD BE EXTRAORDINARY AND LOOK AT THE\nPREFERENCE FOR CONTROL OF CONGRESS.\nTHE DEMOCRATS AT 49%, REPUBLICANS AT 42%, GUESS WHEN\nTHE NUMBERS WERE THAT BAD, MIKE? YOU KNOW THE LAST TIME THE\nNUMBERS WERE THAT BAD FOR REPUBLICANS?\nIN THE MIDDLE OF TED CRUZ'S GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN.\n>> THE HOUSE, THE IDEA THAT THE HOUSE WOULD GO DEMOCRATIC, IS\nTRULY SHOCKING. I MEAN, IT GIVES VOICE TO THE\nDEPTH OF WHAT TRUMP HAS DONE TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN THIS\nCAMPAIGN, WHICH AGAIN, THE QUESTION THAT I JUST POSED, WHAT\nHAPPENS TO THAT PARTY AFTER ELECTION DAY.\n>> WELL LET'S SEE IT'S OCTOBER 11th, EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT\nTHE ELECTIONS TODAY. LET'S SEE WHAT'S LOOKS LIKE ON\nOCTOBER 18th AND IF TRUMP'S CLOSER THAN A LOT OF THESE\nWEASELS THAT HAVE SLIPPED AWAY FROM THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WILL\nCOME RIGHT BACK. THAT'S BEEN THEIR BIGGEST\nPROBLEM ALL ALONG. THEY'VE BEEN WEASELS.\nIF TRUMP LOOKS POPULAR FOR THEIR PEOPLE THEY SUPPORT HIM AND\nLOOKS LESS POPULAR THEY RUN AWAY.\nWE'LL SEE IF THEY RUN BACKP. >> BUT YOU HAVE THE SPEAKER OF\nTHE HOUSE, THE MOST POWERFUL ELECTED REPUBLICAN OFFICIAL IN\nTHE COUNTRY, BASICALLY SAYING HEY, YOU GUYS ARE ON YOUR OWN DO\nWHAT YOU HAVE TO DO. >> YEAH.\n>> PAUL RYAN IS NOT A STUPID MAN.\nHE KNEW WHEN HE GOT ON THE CALL AND SAID THIS HE WOULD TAKE A\nHUGE BACKLASH FROM THE BASE OF THE PARTY AND OTHER REPUBLICAN\nMEMBERS OF THE HOUSE, BUT HE IS NOW GOING TO BE THE LEADER OF\nSAYING TO PEOPLE, HILLARY CLINTON'S GOING TO BE PRESIDENT.\n>> YES. >> THE REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO\nLOSE CONTROL OF THE SENATE. THE ONE THING YOU CAN DO IF YOU\nCARE ABOUT STOPPING HILLARY CLINTON'S POLICY AGENDA IS KEEP\nME AS SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, KEEP REPUBLICANSES MAT JORTY.\nIT'S A RISK. >> THIS IS NOT A POSITION OF\nINSTINCT. THIS IS A POSITION INFORMED BY\nALL THE POLLING THE REPUBLICANS ARE LOOKING AT ON THE HOUSE\nSIDE. RYAN IS LOOKING AT THIS SAYING\nWE HAVE LOST THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE AND OUR MAJORITY IN THE\nHOUSE IS IN JEOPARDY. THIS IS THE ONLY CHOICE I HAVE\nRIGHT NOW ON THE BASIS OF THE NUMBERS NOT JUST THESE PUBLIC\nPOLLS BUT EVERYTHING THE PARTY IS SEEING RIGHT NOW.\n>> WHY WOULDN'T HE JUST PULL HIS ENDORSEMENT?\nWHAT IS HE CLINGING TO? >> HE'S TRYING TO MINIMIZE THE\nDRAMA OF -- OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF HE DID THAT.\nHE HASN'T RULED THAT OUT, ENDORSING HIM.\nWHAT ELSE COULD IT BE. HE'S TRYING --\n>> YEAH. >> HE'S USING HIS JUDGMENT.\nWHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO KEEP ONE CHAMBER IN CONSERVATIVE CONTROL\nTO STOP SPEAKER PELOSI AND MAJORITY LEADER SCHUMER AND\nPRESIDENT CLINTON FROM PASSING A LIBERAL AGENDA.\n>> TRYING NOT TO PROVOKE THE TRUMP BASE EITHER.\nHE FEELS BY DIS-ENDORSING TRUMP HE WOULD ANGER A LARGE PART OF\nTHE PARTY, THE PARTY'S FAITHFUL. >> HURT A LOT OF MEMBERERS.\n>> I THINK KITE GO BOTH WAYS IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS.\n>> I PARENTALLY SOME ARE. >> IT'S OCTOBER 11th.\nI ASKED THIS QUESTION AT THE BEGINNING OF SEPTEMBER.\nIS THE RACE OVER. AND EVERYBODY ON THE TABLE SAID\nTHE RACE WAS OVER. IT THEN TIGHTENED UP.\nBUT I'M HEARING FROM YOU GUYS THAT RACE IS OVER.\n>> OVER. >> SO I CAN -- I JUST WANT TO\nKNOW IF I CAN JUST RELAX OVER THE NEXT THREE WEEKS OR SO, SO\nI'M GOING TO GO AROUND, IT SURE SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE SAYING ON\nOCTOBER 11th WITH THREE WEEKS LEFT THIS RACE IS OVER EVEN\nTHOUGH WE'VE HEARD FROM HAROLD WILSON IN POLITICS A WEEK IS A\nLIFETIME. JOHN HEILEMANN IS THIS RACE\nOVER, IS HILLARY CLINTON THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES? >> ABSENT SOME DRAMATIC\nEXOGENOUS EVENT, YES. >> I LOVE.\n>> EXON NOUS. >> I LOVE EXOGENOUS.\n>> ONE OF THEM COULD -- HILLARY CLINTON COULD GET HIT BY A BUS.\n>> I'LL TELL YOU THAT. >> SO ABSENT --\n>> SO ON YOUR SCORECARD ABSENT OF BEING HIT BY A BUS HILLARY\nCLINTON WILL BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\n>> I MEAN THAT METAPHORICALLY. >> A METEOR COULD STRIKE HER.\n>> THERE COULD BE SOMETHING IN ONE OF THESE WIKILEAKS DUMPS\nTHAT TURNS OUT TO BE GENUINELY INCRIMINATING.\nI'M NOT SAYING I FOE KNOW -- >> A HUGE THING.\n>> HILLARY CLINTON IS THE PRESIDENT.\n>> MARK HALPERIN. >> I DIDN'T SAY IT WAS OVER LAST\nTIME YOU POLLED EVERYBODY. I SAID IT WAS NOT OVER.\nEVEN WHEN HE WAS DOWN -- >> IS IT OVER NOW?\n>> IT IS OVER. BARRING SOME INTERVENING EVENT\nAND BARRING -- DONALD TRUMP HAS TO START TALKING ABOUT WHAT HE\nWOULD DO TO MAKE THE LIVES OF AMERICANS BETTER.\n>> DONALD TRUMP IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE.\n>> I'M SAYING, IF THAT'S THE WAY HE BEHAVES.\n>> RIGHT. >> EVEN WITH SOME INTERVENING\nEVENT, HE CAN'T WIN. >> REALLY?\n>> IF THAT'S WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.\n>> YOU THINK HILLARY CLINTON IS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES? >> IF HE KEEPS TALKING ABOUT\nTHIS AND NOT HOW HE MAKES THE LIVE OF AMERICAN PEOPLE BERTH.\n>> IT'S OVER. THE DAMAGE TO THE SYSTEM AND\nTHIS COUNTRY IS OUT THERE FOR QUITE A WHILE.\n>> YOU CAN'T OVERSTATE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THERE IS CHAOS\nWITHIN THE APPARATUS OF THE CAMPAIGN OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY\nINDEPENDENT OF \"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD\" AND EVERYTHING ELSE\nTHEY ARE WAY BEHIND THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IN TERMS OF A COHESIVE\nORGANIZATION AND THAT GIVES HER INSURANCE HERE SHE'S AHEAD BY 11\nIN THE POLLS. >> I THINK IT'S OVER, BUT I\nTHINK IT'S BEEN UGLY AND, YOU KNOW, BLOOD BATH.\nI THINK HILLARY CLINTON HAS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY HERE TO FIND\nHER VOICE IN A WAY THAT AMERICANS HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE\nAND TO BE REALLY INSPIRING. I THINK THE OPPORTUNITY IS\nMASSIVE. OTHERWISE, SHE KIND OF, YOU\nKNOW, IT'S ALL BEEN KIND OF A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE THAT I THINK\nLEADS TO KIND OF A ROUGH START. I DO THINK IT COULD BE OVER.\nAND YOU? >> I DON'T THINK IT'S OVER.\nI THINK HILLARY CLINTON IS TERRIBLE WITH A LEAD.\nI THINK DONALD TRUMP IS PRETTY GOOD WITH HIS BACK UP AGAINST\nTHE WALL. AND I THINK THERE ARE THREE\nWEEKS AND I THINK ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN OVER THREE WEEKS.\nLISTEN, IF I WERE BETTING, BUT OF COURSE I DON'T BET.\n>> TODAY. >> BUT IF I WERE BETTING TODAY,\nYES, I WOULD BET THAT HILLARY CLINTON WOULD WIN AND I WOULD\nFEEL COMFORTABLE PUTTING A GOOD BIT ON THERE.\nLIKE, YOU KNOW, A WEEK'S SALARY. $27 AND THREE PROOF OF PURCHASE\nSEALS. >> AND A CARTON OF CIGARETTES.\n>> I'M NOT GOING TO BET THAT. >> DON'T WANT TO PART WITH YOUR\nCOOLS. >> STRIKES.\n>> PARLIAMENTS. >> I THINK THE THING THAT\nSURPRISES ME IS HOW EVERS'S ATTITUDE -- EVERYBODY'S ATTITUDE\nGO ON TWITTER IT'S FUNNY. IT'S LIKE -- I'M JUST SAYING\nIT'S LIKE RUNNING FROM ONE SIDE OF A CLIFF TO ANOTHER SIDE TO\nANOTHER SIDE TO ANOTHER SIDE. >> HERE'S THE COUNTER TO A WEEK\nIS A LIFETIME IN POLITICS. >> YEAH.\n>> NUMBER OF AMERICANS WHO SAY THEY WILL NEVER VOTE FOR HIM IS\nJUST TOO HIGH FOR HIM TO WIN RIGHT NOW.\n>> WHAT WAS HILLARY CLINTON'S APPROVAL RATING IN THE NBC\nNEWS/\"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" POLL, HAS IT GONE UP?\nWHO DO PEOPLE THINK ARE MORE HONEST AND TRUSTWORTHY?\nI UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING EXCEPT FOR WHEN YOU HAVE THE TWO\nLEAST POPULAR PEOPLE IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN POLITICS AS\nTHE PARTY NOMINEES. >> EXCEPT WHEN YOU TO BUILD AN\nADVANTAGE IN THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE AND THE DEMOCRATS.\nYOU CAN'T OVERCOME THAT WITH SOMEONE WHO SO MANY AMERICANS\nSAY THEY WILL NEVER VOTE FOR? HE WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE THAT\nVIEW AND THAT'S A HARD VIEW TO CHANGE.\n>> WHAT ALEX SAYS NEEDS TO BE OVER THIS BLOCK.\nSTILL AHEAD, WHAT JOHN HEILEMANN HAS TO SAY BEFORE ALEX STARTED\nSCREAMING IN RUSSIAN IN MY EAR, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT'S ABOUT.\n>> PAUL RYAN SAYING HE WILL NOT DEFEND HIS PARTY'S NOMINEE.\nJOINED BY \"THE WASHINGTON POST\" ROBERT WHO TWEETED MANY WANT TO\nDEFECT FROM TRUMP BUT THE DEBATE GAVE THEM PAUSE SINCE HE ROUSED\nTHEIR BASE.",

AT THE SAME TIME, IMPORTANT TO\nSAY THAT DONALD TRUMP IS A PERSON WHO THEY BELIEVE THEY\nNEED TO KEEP THE HEAT ON AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN, SHOWING NOT\nONLY WHY THEY BELIEVE HE IS NOT QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT, BUT\nWHY HILLARY CLINTON IS QUALIFIED.\nIF YOU LISTEN TO THE SOUND BITE TONIGHT, FROM THE OHIO STATE\nUNIVERSITY HILLARY CLINTON, THE LARGEST RALLY OF HER CAMPAIGN.\nYOU CAN SEE SOME OF THAT AT PLAY.\nLISTEN. >> AND TONIGHT DAY, ON THE DAY\nTHAT I WAS IN THE SITUATION ROOM, WATCHING THE RAID THAT\nBROUGHT OSAMA BIN LADEN TO JUSTICE, HE WAS HOSTING\n\"CELEBRITY APPRENTICE.\" SO IF HE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT\nWHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING THE LAST 30 YEARS, BRING IT ON!\n>> THERE'S BEEN MORE TALK WITHIN THE CLINTON CAMP OF TRYING TO\nEXPAND THE MAP, STEPPING UP THEIR GAME IN RED STATES.\nWHAT'S THE LATEST ON THAT? >> RIGHT, THEY'VE TALKED ABOUT\nTHAT AGAIN AND AGAIN, AND THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT ARIZONA,\nTHEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THE STATE OF GEORGIA, TYPICAL RED STATES,\nSOME SUGGESTION FROM MY COLLEAGUE, DAN MERICA, WHO'S\nBEEN TRAVELING WITH THEM THE WHOLE TIME, THAT THERE'S A TRIP\nIN THE WORKS TO TALK TO EVANGELICALS.\nTHE ESSENTIAL IDEA IS TO MAKE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WORK HARD IN\nDEFENDING STATES THAT TYPICALLY WOULD BE GOP STRONGHOLDS,\nANDERSON. >> TODAY WIKILEAKS PUT OUT\nANOTHER 2,000 CLINTON CAMPAIGN, JOHN PODESTA E-MAILS.\nWHAT WAS IN THEM AND HOW HAS THE",

ISN'T IT SAD WE DON'T HAVE\nSTRONGER LEADERSHIP ON BOTH SIDES?\nTHAT WILL CHANGE IF WE WIN ON NOVEMBER 8th.\nBELIEVE ME. ET CETERA A GOING TO CHANGE\nFAST. >> YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP A FEW\nHOURS AGO IN THE GREAT STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA, A STATE HE HAS TO\nWIN.

HE SAID HE WASN'T TREATED VERY\nFAIRLY. >> WE'LL GET TO THAT.\nWHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE GREAT STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA, LARRY, HE\nNEEDS TO REACH OUT TO VOTERS, ESPECIALLY EDUCATED\nWOMEN AND THE UNDECIDEDS. IF YOU LOOK AT HIS PERFORMANCE\nLAST NIGHT, AT LEAST WHAT HE SAID, IT DIDN'T APPEAR HE WAS\nREACHING OUT TO THOSE VOTERS. DO YOU THINK THAT SPEAKER RYAN\nMADE ANY HEADWAY WHEN IT COMES TO THOSE UNDECIDEDS?\n>> ABSOLUTELY NOT. HE MADE HEADWAY WITH HIS OWN\nBASE AND WITH REPUBLICANS WHO WERE FLAKING AWAY BECAUSE OF\nTHAT SEX TAPE. -- SEX TALK TAPE.\nHE WAS ABLE TO GO AFTER CLINTON HARD ENOUGH TO ATTRACT THOSE\nPEOPLE BACK. THAT'S WHAT STABILIZED HIM, IT\nALSO PLEASED THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN, THE LAST THING THEY\nWANT IS INSTABILITY THAT MIGHT SOMEHOW SOME WAY INEXPLICABLY\nPERHAPS RESULT IN ANOTHER CANDIDATE SUBSTITUTING FOR\nTRUMP. >> TO THAT POINT, THIS NBC WALL\nSTREET JOURNAL POLL, SPEAKER RYAN CLEARLY HERE.\nHIS RESPONSE HAS MORE TO DO WITH THE NUMBERS COMING OUT.\nTHIS IS A POLL. CLINTON IS UP 11 POINTS AND THIS\nIS -- AFTER THE THING ON FRIDAY, THIS LEWD SEX TAPE, THIS IS\nAFTER THAT WAS RELEASED, EXPLAIN THESE NUMBERS TO US, LARRY.\n>> WELL, YOU IDENTIFIED THE MOST IMPORTANT FACT, WHICH IS THIS\nPOLL WAS TAKEN SATURDAY AND SUNDAY, IT'S ALMOST A PURE\nSAMPLE OF PUBLIC OPINION REACTION TO THE RELEASE OF THAT\nPRETTY SHOCKING SEX TALK TAPE NOT SURPRISINGLY, THE REACTION\nWASN'T GOOD. IT WAS ESPECIALLY BAD AMONG\nWOMEN, SUBURBAN WOMEN WHO ARE COLLEGE EDUCATED, WE HAVE THIS\nTREMENDOUS EDUCATIONAL GAP THIS GAP, COMBINE THOSE TWO IN DER\nREACTION TO THAT TAPE, AND YOU CAN SEE WHY IN THIS ONE POLL\nCLINTON WAS AHEAD 11 POINTS, IT'S GOING TO CLOSE SOMEWHAT,\nTHE NORMAL NUMBER, IF THERE IS SUCH A THING AS NORMAL IN THIS\nCAMPAIGN IS A CLINTON LEAD OF FOUR OR FIVE POINTS, WE MAY SEE\nTHAT AGAIN BEFORE NOVEMBER EIGHTH.\n>> FRANK, YOU KNOW, TRUMP CONTINUED ON THE SAME\nSCORCHED EARTH PATH TODAY AT LEAST LAST NIGHT, LET'S LISTEN\nTO THIS. >> I WAS GETTING BEATEN UP FOR\n72 HOURS ON ALL THE NETWORKS FOR INAPPROPRIATE WORDS 12 YEARS\nAGO, LOCKER ROOM TALK, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT, I SAID TO\nMYSELF, WAIT A MINUTE, AND I JUST SAW A VERY INAPPROPRIATE\nWORDS. BUT BILL CLINTON SEXUALLY\nASSAULTED INNOCENT WOMEN, AND HILLARY CLINTON ATTACKED THOSE\nWOMEN VICIOUSLY. ONE OF THEM SAID MORE VICIOUSLY\nTHAN HE ATTACKED THEM. IF THEY WANT TO RELEASE MORE\nTAPES SAYING INAPPROPRIATE THINGS WE'LL CONTINUE TO TALK\nABOUT BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON DOING INAPPROPRIATE THINGS.\nTHERE ARE SO MANY OF THEM, FOLKS.\n>> THE SAME SCORCHED EARTH AS HE DID LAST NIGHT, HE DID TODAY.\nWHAT IS WITH -- WHAT IS HIS STRATEGY, IS IT GOING TO WORK BY\nBRINGING UP THE '90s AND BILL CLINTON'S INDISCRETIONS?\n>> IT WORKS TO GALVANIZE THE BASE.\nI WAS AT THE DEBATE LAST NIGHT, I WAS IN THE HALL, SITTING NEXT\nTO ONE OF TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS. EVERY TIME THE SUBJECT CAME UP\nABOUT THE DEFECTIONS FROM THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, WELL, THOSE\nARE THE ELITE. THEY ARE NOT ANY GOOD ANYWAY.\nYOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MINE TRUMP'S FUNDAMENTAL SUPPORTERS BASICALLY\nWANT TO BURN THE HOUSE DOWN. THEY'RE FURIOUS AT WASHINGTON,\nTHEY'RE FURIOUS AT THE ESTABLISHMENT, POLITICIANS ON\nBOTH SIDES, WHEN YOU WANT TO BURN THE HOUSE DOWN, YOU HIRE\nTHE ARSONIST, THE ARSONIST IS PLAYING WITH LIVE FIRE, AND\nTHAT'S WHAT WE HEARD. DOES IT ADD TO THE BASE?\nPROBABLY NOT AS LARRY SAID. THAT SNAPSHOT, THAT POLL, THAT'S\nA BIG GAP. WHAT IT DOES AFTER THE DEBATE IS\nGOING TO BE VERY INTERESTING TO SEE.\nBUT THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE I WANT TO POINT OUT.\nTHAT IS THAT HE -- DONALD TRUMP RAILS AT THE MEDIA, THE MEDIA IN\nALL ITS FORMS ARE NOT GOING AWAY, THEY'RE RIVETED BY THIS,\nTHEY'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO MAGNIFY HIS WORDS, ACTIONS,\nINCONSISTENCIES AND ATTACKS, HE WILL LIVE BY THAT, OR PERISH BY\nTHAT, RIGHT NOW, HE'S GAMBLING ON THE BASE.\n>> I WAS SITTING WITH SOME PEOPLE WHO WATCHED.\nSOME WERE DECIDED, SOME UNDECIDED.\nTHE SUBJECT OF BILL CLINTON OR THOSE THREE WOMEN CAME UP, SOME\nOF THE UNDECIDED PEOPLE SAID IT SEEMS DESPERATE TO THEM THAT\nTHEY WISH HE WOULD AT LEAST TRY TO BE ABOVE THE FRAY AND NOT\nBELOW THE FRAY. DANA, IS THAT THE CONSENSUS FROM\nPEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT DECIDED WHO THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR IN\nTHIS ELECTION? >> I THINK PEOPLE WHO ARE\nUNDECIDED ARE JUST FLAT OUT DISGUSTED BY THIS PARTICULAR\nISSUE. IT IS REALLY HARD TO IMAGINE\nTHAT BRINGING THOSE FOUR WOMEN INTO THE DEBATE HALL, NEVER MIND\nHAVING THE POLITICAL STUNT, PHOTO OP, I MEAN, IT WAS A\nSTUNT, DOING WHAT HE DID BEFOREHAND WITH THEM, RIGHT\nBEFORE A MAJOR PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE.\nHARD TO IMAGINE THAT IS GOING TO MAKE UNDECIDED VOTERS SAY, OH,\nWOW! I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR DONALD\nTRUMP. THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME.\nIT'S JUST HARD TO IMAGINE. JUST AS LARRY AND FRANK WERE\nSAYING, THAT WAS ALL ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THE BOTTOM\nDOESN'T REALLY FALL OUT, THAT POLL WE WERE TALKING ABOUT, IF\nWE CAN PUT IT BACK UP, NOT ONLY IS IT AN 11 POINT GAP, IT'S WELL\nBELOW WHAT HAS BEEN HIS STANDARD FLOOR, WHICH IS KIND OF IN THE\n40s. 40, 41 PERCENT.\nTHAT MEANS HE LOST HIS SUPPORTERS, WHICH HE NEEDED TO\nGET BACK BEFORE HE COULD BUILD ON THE UNDECIDED VOTERS.\n>> YOU ASKED THE QUESTION OF THE DESPERATION OF BRINGING UP OLD\nCLAIMS AGAINST BILL CLINTON. IT'S NOT JUST DESPERATION, BUT A\nDISTRACTION. YOU COULD ARGUE THAT\nTRUMP'S STRONGEST LINE AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON IS SHE'S OLD\nNEWS, FAILED POLICY, SHE CAN'T BE TRUSTED ALL OF THAT INSTEAD\nOF TAKING TIME GOING AFTER A FEW EFFECTIVE ATTACKS.\nNOW HE'S SCATTERING SHOTS AROUND THINGS THAT DISGUST A LOT OF\nPEOPLE. YOU COULD ALSO ARGUE THAT HE IS\nMISSING OPPORTUNITIES HERE BY FILLING UP THE AIR WITH SOME\nOF THIS OTHER STUFF. >> WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE\nDEBATE LAST NIGHT, WHAT DID AND DID NOT HAPPEN, AND BEHIND THE\nSCENES WHEN THESE FOUR WOMEN WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE\nTHEY WERE GOING TO SIT, WE'LL BE BACK.",

THAT'S A BAD PLACE TO BE.\n>> DO YOU WANT TO ASK THE FLY FROM THE DEBATE A QUESTION?\n>> CHRIS BOOKED HIM. >> OR I SAY THAT BECAUSE IT\nKEEPS LANDING ON ME. IT NEVER GOES NEAR ALISYN, WHICH\nRAISES ANOTHER VERY DAMAGING PROSPECT FOR ME.\nTHE TRUTH HURTS. SO THE POLL IS ONLY AS GOOD AS\nITS CROSS TABS. THE CNN AUDIENCE IS\nSOPHISTICATED. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.\nWHICH NUMBERS WITHIN WHICH GROUP OF DEMOGRAPHICS WENT WHICH WAY.\nWE'RE GOING TO WANT TO DIGEST THAT LATER.\nBUT IT'S NOT THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD TO HAVE A BIG LEAD AS\nYOU GET TOWARDS THE FINISH LINE. I'LL TELL YOU WHY.\nIT SOUNDS COUNTERINTUITIVE. BUT IT'S ABOUT MOTIVATING YOUR\nBASE TO GET OUT AND VOTE. THE OBAMA PEOPLE COULDN'T TALK\nENOUGH IN THE LAST CYCLE ABOUT HOW IT WAS PRETTY CLOSE NEAR THE\nEND. YOU GOT TO COME OUT AND VOTE.\nCLINTON, I THINK, IS PROBABLY LOOKING AT IT THAT WAY AS WELL.\n>> ABSOLUTELY. IT'S ONE OF THESE REASONS YOU\nSEE THE E-MAILS. THE FUNDRAISING E-MAILS YOU GET\nFROM BOTH PARTIES. IT'S ALMOST THE END, THEY'RE\nCATCHING UP, THEY'RE GOING TO WIN.\nTHEY DO WANT PEOPLE TO GET OUT THERE.\nTHEY DON'T WANT TO THINK SHE'S SAFE.\nTHEY DON'T WANT TO THINK SHE'S SO FAR AHEAD THAT THEY DON'T\nNEED TO STAND UP AND BE COUNTED. DONALD TRUMP HAS THE, OKAY,\nGUYS, WE'RE AGAINST THE WALL. HILLARY CLINTON NEEDS TO CREATE\nTHE SAME THING. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME AUDIO\nTHAT HAS SURFACED OF BILL CLINTON FROM 1996 WHERE HE\nSUPPORTED THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT.\nLET ME PLAY THE AUDIO, THEN WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT.\n>> PRESIDENT CLINTON WANTS A COMPLETE BAN ON LATE-TERM\nABORTIONS, EXCEPT WHEN THE MOTHER'S LIFE IS IN DANGER AND\nFACES SEVERE HEALTH RISK, SUCH AS THE INABILITY TO HAVE ANOTHER\nCHILD. THE PRESIDENT SIGNED THE DEFENSE\nOF MARRIAGE ACT, SUPPORTS SCHOOL UNIFORMS TO TEACH OUR CHILDREN\nDISCIPLINE. HIS CRIME BILL EXPANDED THE\nDEATH PENALTY FOR DRUG KINGPINS. BOB DOLE OPPOSED HIM AND IS\nRESORTING TO UNTRUE, NEGATIVE ATT\nATTACKS. >> SO THIS WAS A RADIO AD THAT\nAIRED ON CHRISTIAN RADIO STATIONS WHERE HE'S TOUTING HIS\nSUPPORT FOR THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT.\nDOES THIS IN SOME WAY COME BACK TO BITE HILLARY CLINTON IN TERMS\nOF HER SUPPORT OR HER LATE SUPPORT FOR SAME-SEX MARRIAGE?\n>> NO, BUT IT JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU WHERE WE WERE BACK THEN AND\nWHERE WE ARE NOW. IT WASN'T JUST BILL CLINTON.\nIT WAS ALMOST EVERY DEMOCRATIC LEADER IN THE SENATE, INCLUDING\nTHE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER AT THE TIME.\nOBVIOUSLY THIS WAS TERRIBLE, AND THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT THE GAY\nCOMMUNITY REALLY STRUGGLED WITH A LOT, CONTINUING TO SUPPORT THE\nDEMOCRATIC PARTY AT THAT TIME. THEY'VE SINCE RECONCILED THAT.\nWHERE THEY ARE NOW IS WHERE THEY WANT TO BE, OBVIOUSLY.\nWHILE THERE SHOULD BE SOME CONCERN ABOUT WHY THEY FLIPPED\nAND WHY WE WERE AT THAT POSITION, IT'S PROBABLY NOT\nGOING TO HURT THEM. >> THEY PLAY WITH THE WORD\nEV EVOLVE.\nYOU SAY THAT WAS HORRIBLE. WASN'T HORRIBLE THEN AND IT'S\nNOT HORRIBLE NOW IF YOU HAVE A CERTAIN SET OF VALUES ABOUT WHAT\nMARRIAGE MEANS. IT'S A REFLECTION OF THE\nCLINTON'S MOVE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY TO THE CENTER.\nTHAT WAS WHAT THEY DID THEN TO MOVE THE PARTY TO BE MORE\nEFFECTIVE. HILLARY CLINTON, YOU COULD\nARGUE, IS DOING THE SAME THING NOW.\nSHE'S TAKING THE POSITIONS TO MAKE HER MORE EFFECTIVE.\nISN'T THAT WHAT POLITICS? >> TO AN EXTENT.\nIF YOU'RE SOMEONE THAT REALLY HATED DOMA, LOOK AT THE\nALTERNATIVE. THE REPUBLICAN PLATFORM ISN'T\nFOR SAME-SEX MARRIAGE. >> YOU TALK ABOUT A GUY PICKING\nA POSITION. DONALD TRUMP ALWAYS SAID HE\nDIDN'T REALLY CARE ABOUT ANYTHING LIKE THAT.\nNOW HE'S GOT TO TAKE IT BECAUSE HE WANTS TO BE THE GOP NOMINEE.\n>> EXACTLY. THAT'S ANOTHER REASON TO MARK'S\nPOINT THAT I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO HURT HER.\n>> JACKIE, MARK, THANK YOU.",

DONNY, START TAKING US THROUGH\nIT. >> I WANT TO START WITH THE\nTIMES TRUMP LAUNCHED DIRECT ATTACKS, INTERRUPTING HER AT\nTIMES, AND A FEW OFF THE CUFF SNIPES THAT OOZED WITH VITRIOL.\n>> IF I WIN, I AM GOING TO INSTRUCT MY ATTORNEY GENERAL TO\nGET A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR TO LOOK INTO YOUR SITUATION.\n>> IT'S JUST AWFULLY GOOD THAT SOMEONE WITH THE TEMPERAMENT OF\nDONALD TRUMP IS NOT IN CHARGE OF THE LAW IN OUR COUNTRY.\n>> BECAUSE YOU'D BE IN JAIL. AND BELIEVE ME, SHE HAS\nTREMENDOUS HATE IN HER HEART. >> OKAY, LET ME FRAME\nEVERYTHING. THIS IS NOW ABOUT GENDER.\nTHIS IS NOT ABOUT POLITICS, THIS IS ABOUT GENDER.\nWHAT PEOPLE SAW ABOUT DONALD TRUMP ON FRIDAY INFORMS\nEVERYTHING. NOW, THEY SAW A MAN -- THEY\nHEARD A MAN AS A SEXUAL PREDATOR, AS A SEXUAL ASSAULT,\nOR WHATEVER IT IS, AND NOW ON STAGE, TELLING HILLARY CLINTON\nI'M GOING TO PUT HER IN JAIL, ATTACK MODE.\nAND I THINK THAT CONTINUES A NARRATIVE, THAT IS JUST GOING TO\nTAKE HIM DOWN THE DRAIN. IT COULDN'T BE ANY -- EVERY\nWOMAN -- NOT EVERY WOMAN -- WOMEN IN AMERICA WERE SITTING\nTHERE LIKE THIS. THOSE THINGS THAT THEY HEARD\nFRIDAY DID NOT GO AWAY AT THE DEBATE.\nMARK, THOUGHTS? >> MY INTUITION IS THE SAME AS\nYOURS. I WANT TO WAIT FOR DATA AND SEE.\nTHESE ARE ALL OBVIOUSLY REALLY COMPLICATED ISSUES.\nI THOUGHT THE FACT THAT HE DENIED THE BEHAVIOR AND CLAIMED\nIT WAS BASICALLY JUST BLUSTERY TALK, ONLY UNDER REPEATED\nQUESTIONS FROM ANDERSON COOPER, AND HADN'T DONE IT PREVIOUSLY, I\nTHINK A LOT OF WOMEN WILL LOOK AT THAT AND SAY, COME ON.\n>> THIS IS YEAR 60 OF THE FEMINIST MOVEMENT.\nTHEY'RE NOT GOING BACKWARDS. OKAY, MOVING ON.\nTHE NEXT THING I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS HOW CLINTON FOR THE\nMOST PART CHOSE NOT TO TAKE THE BAIT, DEFECTING CONFLICT,\nINSTEAD OF GETTING DOWN IN THE MUD.\n>> SO MUCH OF WHAT HE'S SAID IS NOT RIGHT.\nBUT HE GETS TO RUN HIS CAMPAIGN ANY WAY HE CHOOSES.\nHE GETS TO DECIDE WHAT HE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT.\nINSTEAD OF ANSWERING PEOPLE'S QUESTIONS, TALKING ABOUT HIS\nAGENDA. WHEN I HEAR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,\nI'M REMINDED OF SOMETHING OUR FRIEND MICHELLE OBAMA ADVISED\nUS. WHEN THEY GO LOW, YOU GO HIGH.\n>> WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER 15,000. >> PLEASE ALLOW HER TO RESPOND.\nSHE DIDN'T TALK WHILE YOU TALKED.\n>> BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOTHING TO SAY.\n>> I DIDN'T IN THE FIRST DEBATE AND I'LL TRY NOT TONIGHT.\nDONALD, I KNOW YOU'RE INTO BIG DIVERSION TONIGHT.\nANYTHING TO AVOID TALKING ABOUT YOUR CAMPAIGN AND THE WAY IT'S\nEXPLODING AND THE WAY REPUBLICANS ARE LEAVING YOU --\n>> LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS -- >> ALLOW HER TO RESPOND.\n>> LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. >> -- THE ISSUES THAT PEOPLE\nCARE ABOUT TONIGHT. >> ONCE AGAIN, LENSED AGAINST\nFRIDAY, I THINK HILLARY CLINTON MADE THE VERY WISE DECISION, I'M\nNOT GOING TO BE PUNCHING BACK. I ACTUALLY WANT TO APPEAR ALMOST\nLIKE A VICTIM ON STAGE. I THINK THESE THINGS ARE\nRELATED. THE VIEWERS DO NOT TAKE IN,\nHERE'S THE DEBATE AND HERE'S THE BILLY BUSH THING AND HERE'S\nTHIS. IT'S ALL PERCOLATING AT THE SAME\nTIME. I THINK HILLARY CLINTON ACTUALLY\nLOOKED MORE EMPATHETIC THAN SHE EVER DID BEFORE.\nI THINK THAT WAS VERY DELIBERATE FOR HER TO NOT BE FEISTY, BUT\nALMOST HAVE THIS MAN HOVERING AT HER, AND KIND OF JUST LAYING\nBACK. JOHN, THOUGHTS?\nWELL, YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT, DONNY, I THOUGHT THERE WERE A\nCOUPLE OF MOMENTS, THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN THING, SOME SMALL\nMISSTEPS. I THINK BY AND LARGE, YOU'RE\nRIGHT, THE SENSE THAT IF YOU'RE WATCHING SELF-IMMOLATE OR\nWATCHING SOMEONE DIG A HOLE, THE RIGHT STRATEGY IS TO LET THEM\nKEEP DIGGING. AND I THINK SHE FELT LIKE -- THE\nFIRST DEBATE IT REALLY WORKED TO BAIT DONALD TRUMP.\nIN THIS DEBATE, HE'D ALREADY KIND OF BAITED HIMSELF, YOU\nKNOW, IN SOME WAYS, TEN YEARS AGO, WHEN HE MADE THE COMMENTS\nTHAT BECAME SO DAMAGING TO HIM OVER THE WEEKEND.\nSHE DIDN'T NEED TO DO A LOT MORE THAN JUST LET HIM PLAY OUT THE\nSTRING. >> OKAY.\nTHERE WERE ALSO SOME UNFORGETTABLE VISUALS FROM THE\nDEBATE. TRUMP DIDN'T SEEM TO KNOW WHAT\nTO DO WHEN HE WASN'T SPEAKING AND THERE WERE TIMES HE JUST\nHOVERED, I WOULD SAY, CREEPILY BEHIND CLINTON WHILE SHE\nANSWERED AUDIENCE QUESTIONS. AND EVERYONE WAS WATCHING BILL\nCLINTON'S REACTION AS TRUMP REHASHED DECADES-OLD CLAIM OF\nSEXUAL MISCONDUCT AGAINST HIM AS HIS ACCUSERS SAT INSIDE THE\nDEBATE HALL. >> I THOUGHT THE GYMNASTICS OF\nTRUMP WERE STUNNING, GIVEN THE THINGS I JUST MENTIONED.\nTHE FACT THAT HE WAS LITERALLY ON HER, YOU ALMOST FELT\nUNCOMFORTABLE AT HOME, SO BOTH FROM A VERBAL, STRATEGIC, AND\nPHYSICAL HOVERING -- I'M GOING TO USE THE WORD, PREDATORY,\nAGAIN. I THINK WOMEN IN AMERICA WERE\nGOING LIKE THIS. I COULD NOT BELIEVE WHAT I WAS\nSEEING. DID EITHER OF YOU GUYS FEEL WHAT\nI WAS FEELING? MARK?\n>> WELL, WITH I THINK THE DIRECTOR DIDN'T DO HIM ANY\nFAVORS WITH, THE WAY THEY TOOK THAT SHOT, I THINK, HIGHLIGHTED\nTHE KIND OF SPATIAL RELATIONS WAY THAT WAS SLIGHTLY DISTORTED.\nI ALSO THINK, I MAY BE WRONG ABOUT THIS, BUT MY IMPRESSION\nWAS, MOST OF THE TIME WHEN HE WAS QUOTE/UNQUOTE HOVERING\nBEHIND HER, SHE HAD WALKED OVER BASICALLY INTO HIS SPACE, AND HE\nJUST DIDN'T WALK AWAY AND CLEAR THE SHOT.\nBUT HE DIDN'T INITIATE THAT SPATIAL RELATIONSHIP.\nHE JUST ENDED UP THERE BECAUSE SHE WALKED OVER.\n>> I MEAN, JOHN, I'M WATCHING -- >> AS FOR THE BILL CLINTON\nREACTIONS, THEY BELONG IN THE SMITHSONIAN.\n>> JOHN, I'M WATCHING THIS LITERALLY AS HE'S FOLLOWING HER\nAROUND. I MEAN, WE ALL KNOW WOMEN -- I\nHAD A DAUGHTER WATCHING WITH ME, AND SHE WAS GETTING A LITTLE\nCREEPED OUT. AM I OVERSTATING THIS?\nJOHN? >> THE THING IT SHOWED HERE IS\nDONALD TRUMP DID MORE DEBATE PREP FOR THIS DEBATE THAN HE DID\nFOR THE FIRST ONE, BUT THE KIND OF DEBATE PREP HE DIDN'T DO WAS\nTHE KIND OF THAT REVOLVED AROUND THIS CHOREOGRAPHER.\nAND IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I DID FOR A WEEK BEFORE THIS DEBATE,\nTHIS MIGHT BE A PROBLEM FOR HIM. AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE A\nPROBLEM FOR HIM, FOR SURE. IT JUST -- IT WAS NOT A GOOD\nLOOK. AND I DON'T -- THERE WERE OTHER\nMORE DAMAGING THINGS THAN THAT, BUT I DID NOT THINK IT WAS WELL\nEXECUTED ON THAT FRONT. >> ALL RIGHT.\nDONNY, THANK YOU FOR TAKING US THROUGH ALL THAT.\nWE'LL HAVE MORE OUT HERE FROM ME IN NORTH CAROLINA, JOHN UP IN\nPENNSYLVANIA OUT WITH TRUMP AND PENCE THE DAY AFTER THE DEBATE\nWHEN WE COME BACK.",

IN A TOWN HALL FORMAT, SEE\nTHAT'S PERHAPS MORE CRUCIAL THAN ANY OTHER FORMAT.\nTHE LEAD INSTRUCTOR AT THE BODY LANGUAGE INSTITUTE, CHRIS, GOOD\nTO SEE YOU AGAIN. >> HI, ERIN.\n>> ONE OF THE THINGS WE KEEP HEARING ABOUT BECAUSE IT WAS A\nTOWN HALL FORMAT, YOU HAD HILLARY CLINTON STANDING AND\nWALKING AROUND, DONALD TRUMP WALKING AROUND.\nSOMETIMES WHEN SHE WOULD WALK OVER TO THE AUDIENCE, HE SORT OF\nSEEMED TO BE JUST LOOMING BACK THERE.\nWHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS BODY INTERACTION, FOR LACK OF A\nBETTER WORD? >> WELL, FOR HILLARY, SHE'S\nWALKING OVER TO CONNECT WITH THE VOTER.\nTO COME UP CLOSE, TO MAKE THAT, HAVE THAT RAPPORT AND MAKE THAT\nCONNECTION. AND SIMPLY WE SEE DONALD TRUMP\nMOVE INTO HER PERSONAL SPACE. THIS IS SOMETHING WE CALL\nPROXEMIX, THE SPACE IN WHICH WE INTERACT.\nZERO TO 18 INCHES IS PRIVATE INTIMATE SPACE AND BEYOND THAT 2\nTO 4 FEET IS MUCH MORE PERSONAL SPACE.\nBUT BY DONALD TRUMP MOVING INTO THAT SPACE, IT'S A VERY\nAGGRESSIVE MOVE. IT'S LITERALLY LIKE HE'S MOVING\nINTO HER PERSONAL SPACE. HERE HE IS TALKING ABOUT HE\nRESPECTS WOMEN AND HERE HE IS MOVING INTO HER SPACE, BACKING\nRIGHT INTO HER. HE ALSO THEN WILL WANDER OFF\nAROUND THE BACK SIDE OF THE STAGE THERE.\nIT'S ALMOST AT THAT POINT HE REALIZES HE DOES SOME FIL\nDISTANCING.

AND IT SHOWS THAT PHYSICALLY,\nTHE MANIFESTATION SHOWS THROUGH THE LIPS VANISHING.\n>> AND JUST BEFORE THE DEBATE STARTED, BILL CLINTON AND\nMELANIA TRUMP WERE INTRODUCED, A MOMENT EVERYBODY WAS WATCHING.\nTHIS, OF COURSE, HAPPENED AFTER TRUMP APPEARED WITH, INVITED\nCLINTON'S PAST ACCUSERS TO THE DEBATE.\nTHEY WERE GOING TO BE IN THE ROOM.\nVERY AWKWARD HANDSHAKE. WHAT DO YOU SEE WHEN YOU SEE\nTHAT PARTICULAR INSTANT? >> WELL, IT'S A NIGHT OF\nCONTRASTS, ERIN, IN TERMS OF THE INITIAL HANDSHAKE BETWEEN THE --\nTHE LACK OF HANDSHAKE BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY\nCLINTON, VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE LAST DEBATE.\nHERE ALSO A CONTRAST. IN THE LAST DEBATE, WE SAW MR.\nCLINTON WHEN HE WOULD -- WHEN THE TRUMP FAMILY, THEY SHOOK\nHANDS WARMLY. THEY SAID HELLO.\nTHIS IS THE OPPOSITE. WHEN HE WALKS UP TO MELANIA,\nHE'S NOT EFACING HER. WE'LL NORMALLY FACE OUR BELLY\nBUTTON IN THE DIRECTION OF PEOPLE WE'RE TALKING TO AS WE\nGREET THEM. HE'S OPEN AND HE'S FACING THE\nSEATS AWAY FROM HER. IT'S ALMOST LIKE HE'S GIVING HER\nA COLD SHOULDER AND SHE HIM. IT'S A VERY UNFRIENDLY\nHANDSHAKE. IT'S MUCH MORE CORDIAL, POLITE,\nLET'S GET THIS DONE SO BOTH OF US CAN GO TO OUR SEATS.\nIT'S ABOUT ENDING THAT AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.\nPROBABLY WE CAN PUERCEIVE FROM THAT IT'S LIKELY BASED UPON THE\nHOURS BEFOREHAND AND THE ANTAGONISM THAT HAD BUILT UP.\n>> I'M SURE. >> WE SEE THAT MANIFESTED IN\nBETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM. >> THANKS VERY MUCH TO YOU.\nTO REMIND EVERYBODY, BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON WERE AT DONALD\nTRUMP AND MELANIA TRUMP'S WEDDING.\nSHE MET THEM THERE.

TRUMP, SECRETARY CLINTON,\nWE WANT TO GET TO THE AUDIENCE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, BOTH OF\nYOU. >> NOW, OTHER TIMES, TO USE\nMICHELLE OBAMA'S HIGH-LOW FORMULATION, THEY WENT LOW, AS\nIN THIS FIRST-EVER THAT I'VE EVER HEARD SUGGESTION BY ONE\nCANDIDATE TO ANOTHER THAT THEY WOULD IMPRISON THE LOSER OF THE\nELECTION IF THEY BECAME PRESIDENT.\nTAKE A LISTEN. >> IT'S JUST AWFULLY GOOD THAT\nSOMEONE WITH THE TEMPERAMENT OF DONALD TRUMP IS NOT IN CHARGE OF\nTHE LAW IN OUR COUNTRY. >> BECAUSE YOU'D BE IN JAIL.\n>> SECRETARY CLINTON -- >> NOW, WHO CAME OUT ON TOP,\nTAKE A LOOK AT THESE QUICK POLLS THAT WERE TAKEN AFTER THE\nDEBATE, AND I'LL GIVE YOU THE CAVEAT THAT IT SOMETIMES TAKES A\nCOUPLE OF DAYS FOR THE FULL EFFECT OF THE DEBATE TO FILTER\nINTO THE ELECTORATE, BUT CNN, 57% TO 34%.\nWATCHERS OF THE DEBATE SAID HILLARY CLINTON WON.\nYOUGOV SAID HILLARY CLINTON WON BUT BY A NARROWER MARGIN, 47 TO\n42, SO WE HAVE A SITUATION BOTH SIDES WERE SPEAKING TO THEIR\nBASE. HILLARY CLINTON TRIED TO RALLY\nDEMOCRATIC COALITION WITH A LOT OF WOMEN, MINORITY VOTERS,\nCOLLEGE-EDUCATED VOTERS. DONALD TRUMP WENT FOR HIS BASE,\nWHICH IS NONCOLLEGE WHITE VOTERS AND TRIED TO GET THEM EXCITED\nAFTER A VERY TOUGH WEEKEND WHEN HE WAS IN FREE FALL OVER THAT\nTAPE. BOTH OF THEM SEEM TO ACHIEVE\nTHEIR OBJECTIVES. THE DIFFERENCE IS, THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON'S AHEAD IN THIS RACE AND DONALD TRUMP, IF HE'S GOING TO\nBE PRESIDENT, NEEDS TO MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN TO CHANGE THAT.\n>> JOHN, THANK YOU FOR SETTING US UP, OUR JOHN HARWOOD IN ST.\nLOUIS. JOINING US WITH MORE REACTION,\nKEITH BOYKIN AND INFORMAL TRUMP CAMPAIGN ADVISER AND CNBC\nCONTRIBUTOR LARRY KUDLOW. GOOD MORNING TO YOU.\nYOU SPOKE THIS MORNING, LARRY, ON \"SQUAWK\" ABOUT HOW YOU'RE\nABSORBING THE LAST 72 HOURS. WHERE ARE YOU?\n>> WELL, WHERE I AM IS EXTREMELY UNHAPPY WITH MR. TRUMP'S VILE\nREMARKS 11 YEARS AGO, AND I THINK SOME OF THAT IS SPILLED\nOVER INTO THIS CAMPAIGN. AND I DON'T LIKE IT ONE BIT,\nNEVER HAVE. I REPORT IT AS I SEE IT, AND I\nDON'T LIKE IT. ON THE OTHER HAND, I THINK HE\nDID BOTTOM. HE WAS A STOCK THAT FINALLY\nFOUND THE BOTTOM. I THINK THE HEMORRHAGING HAS\nSTOPPED. HE WAS REENDORSED BY HIS RUNNING\nMATE MIKE PENCE. THAT WAS VERY MUCH UP IN THE AIR\nOVER THE WEEKEND. NOW, CAN HE COME BACK AND WIN, I\nDON'T KNOW. IT'S AN UPHILL BATTLE.\nI DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE EARLY POLLS, BUT MRS. CLINTON\nDEFINITELY HAS THE UPPER HAND. I REMAIN IN FAVOR OF MR. TRUMP'S\nOVERALL ECONOMIC AND TAX CUT PLAN.\nYES, I HELPED DRAFT IT, AMONG OTHERS.\nI WISH HE WOULD SELL IT BETTER. I MEAN, HE'S GOT THE RIGHT STUFF\nIN THERE, BUT, YOU KNOW, TAX CUTS ARE GOOD BECAUSE THEY PUT\nMORE MONEY IN YOUR POCKET, BECAUSE YOU GET MORE TAKE HOME\nPAY, AS REAGAN USED TO SAY, BECAUSE YOU HAD MORE INCENTIVES\nTO INVEST AND START A NEW BUSINESS.\nI DON'T THINK YOU CAN TAX YOUR WAY TO PROSPERITY REGARDING MRS.\nCLINTON, BUT I'LL JUST SAY ONE LAST THING, IT'S NOT A\nCONCESSION TO MY FRIEND KEITH, IT'S MY OWN PERSONAL VIEW.\nI WATCHED THAT THING LAST NIGHT, AND ONE THING STUCK OUT AT ME.\nI DISAGREE WITH MRS. CLINTON'S POLICIES, I DO, THAT'S NOT\nBREAKING NEWS, BUT SHE HAD AT MOMENTS A PRETTY GOOD SENSE OF\nOPTIMISM. AND I'M AN OPTIMISTIC GUY.\nIT CAME OUT, AND DONALD, I THINK HE MAYBE IS AN OPTIMIST IN THE\nLONG RUN, BUT HE'S SO NEGATIVE AND WE'RE GOING TO HECK, GOING\nTO HECK, AND HE DIDN'T SAY, BUT WE CAN FIX THIS AND HAVE AN\nOPTIMISTIC, YOU KNOW, REAGANIST MESSAGE.\nOPTIMISTS WIN, PESSIMISTS LOSE. IN 2012 BARACK OBAMA WAS THE\nOPTIMIST AND MITT ROMNEY WAS THE PESSIMIST AND I THINK THAT'S ONE\nREASON WHY MR. OBAMA WON, SO I WOULD JUST WARN GOP ON THAT.\nOPTIMISM WINS. I'M AN OPTIMIST, HAVE BEEN MANY,\nMANY YEARS, IT'S GOOD, I LIKE IT.\n>> THE DIFFERING MESSAGES COMING OUT OF EACH PART, BUT THE TRUMP\nWE SAW LAST NIGHT WAS HIGH ENERGY.\nHE HAD SOME GOOD HUMOR, AND HE SEEMED TO BE RELATIVELY ON\nMESSAGE, COMPARED TO HIS PRIOR DEBATE PERFORMANCE.\nDOES THAT MEAN HE'S BECOMING A MORE FORMIDABLE COMPETITOR TO\nCLINTON IN FUTURE FACE-OFFS? >> IT MEANS THAT WE KEEP JUDGING\nDONALD TRUMP BY A LOWER AND LOWER STANDARD.\nTHE BAR HAS GOTTEN SO PATHETICALLY LOW THAT ALL HE HAS\nTO DO IS NOT SNIFFLE TOO MUCH, AND WE THINK THAT HE'S BECOMING\nAN ACCEPTABLE CANDIDATE. I MEAN, LAST NIGHT WHAT WE SAW\nWAS STUNNING. WE SAW A MAJOR PARTY NOMINEE FOR\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES DISMISS ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL\nASSAULT AS MERE LOCKER ROOM TALK.\nWE SAW THE SAME CANDIDATE ADMIT THAT FOR 20 YEARS HE DID NOT PAY\nFEDERAL INCOME TAXES, AND WE SAW THAT SAME CANDIDATE THREATEN TO\nJAIL HIS POLITICAL OPPONENT. WE HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE\nTHIS IN AMERICAN POLITICS. PERHAPS THAT'S A REASON WHY\nFOREIGN POLICY MAGAZINE TODAY ENDORSED HILLARY CLINTON.\nITS FIRST EVER ENDORSEMENT OF ANY CANDIDATE FOR OFFICE, AND\nSAID THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS THE WORST MAJOR PARTY NOMINEE OF ANY\nPARTY IN U.S. HISTORY. WE'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE\nTHIS BEFORE. >> YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY, GO\nAHEAD. >> I WAS JUST GOING TO ASK YOU,\nLARRY, WE TALK ABOUT MARKET SHARE, WE TALK ABOUT BUSINESS.\nCONFIDENCE IS IMPORTANT. DISCIPLINE OF AN EXECUTIVE, OF\nTHE EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAS ENORMOUS INFLUENCE, WHETHER IT'S\nHAS TO DO WITH REGULATORY POWER, WHETHER IT HAS TO DO WITH\nSTATEMENTS MADE TO AND ABOUT FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS.\nGIVEN THAT DONALD TRUMP BRAGGED ABOUT COMMITTING SEXUAL ASSAULT\nAND THEN SAID, NO, HE WAS JUST LYING TO BILLY BUSH, CALLED IT\nLOCKER ROOM TALK, WHICH IS PROBABLY AN INSULT TO ATHLETES.\nSENDS A QUESTIONABLE MESSAGE TO YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE IN LOCKER\nROOMS NOWADAYS ABOUT WHAT'S APPROPRIATE IN THAT SPACE.\nARE YOU PREPARED, ARE YOU GOING TO RE-ENDORSE HIM AT SOME POINT,\nGIVEN THE MISGIVINGS YOU HAD OVER THE WEEKEND?\nIS THERE SOMETHING YOU COULD HEAR FROM HIM AT THIS POINT THAT\nWOULD GIVE YOU A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE OVER THE SORT OF\nTEMPERAMENT AND LEADER THAT HE WOULD BE?\n>> WELL, I BELIEVE WHAT HE SAID IN THOSE TAPES WAS VILE.\nNOT GOING TO DEFEND HIM, IN FACT, I'M GOING TO CRITICIZE HIM\nHEAVILY. I BELIEVE SOME OF THE THINGS HE\nSAID ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL ABOUT WOMEN AND OTHER GROUPS HAVE BEEN\nVILE. I DON'T LIKE IT ONE BIT.\nI'VE BEEN IN A BUNCH OF LOCKER ROOMS, I'VE PLAYED VARSITY\nTENNIS IN PREP SCHOOL AND COLLEGE.\nI DIDN'T SAY -- YOU MIGHT SEE A PRETTY WOMAN AND MIGHT SAY\nSOMETHING NICE ABOUT HER, BUT THIS OTHER STUFF IS BEYOND THE\nPALE, SO, NO, I WON'T DEFEND THAT.\nI WILL DEFEND HIS TAX CUT PLAN, I BELIEVE HE HAS A PRO GROWTH\nTAX CUT PLAN AND REGULATORY PLAN.\nLAST NIGHT I THOUGHT HE DID REASONABLY WELL, MAYBE COMPARED\nTO LOW STANDARDS, KEITH HAS A POINT THERE.\nHE DID WELL ON TAX CUTS, ON HEALTH CARE, ON ENERGY.\nI THINK MRS. CLINTON IS VERY VULNERABLE TO ALL THAT.\nAS I SAID EARLIER, I'D LIKE TO SEE HIM SELL HIS PROSPERITY\nPROGRAMS A LOT BETTER. YOU KNOW, I WORKED FOR A GUY,\nREAGAN, WHO KNEW HOW TO SELL AND PERSUADE.\nSO I'D LIKE TO SEE HIM DO MUCH MORE OF THAT.\nI THINK HE TOOK A BIG RISK ATTACKING BILL CLINTON AND\nHILLARY. I THINK HE THREADED THAT NEEDLE.\nI THINK HIS TEMPERAMENT LAST NIGHT WAS PRETTY GOOD, AND IT\nHELPED HIM. AND UNFORTUNATELY, I JUST SAY\nTHIS IN PERSONAL TERMS, YOU KNOW, I DON'T WISH ILL ON\nANYBODY. IT'S ABOUT POLICIES, NOT\nPERSONALITIES FOR ME, BUT SHE WAS DEFLATED, AND YOU COULD SEE\nTHAT. AND IT AFFECTED THE REST OF THE\nDEBATE. BUT I WILL SAY THIS, FOUR WEEKS\nLEFT, ALL RIGHT, I WILL SAY, AS I DID THIS MORNING, I INTEND TO\nVOTE FOR MR. TRUMP, BUT IF HE CONTINUES TO DROP INTO THESE\nINCREDIBLE RABBIT HOLES, I WILL WRITE IN MIKE PENCE, OKAY, I\nWILL NOT VOTE FOR MRS. CLINTON BECAUSE MY DISAGREEMENTS WITH\nHER, NOT PERSONAL, MY DISAGREEMENTS ON POLICY WITH HER\nARE VERY LARGE. TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN WILL LIVE FOR\nANOTHER DAY. THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENED\nLAST NIGHT, AS I SAID, AS A STOCK LOOKING FOR BOTTOM, I\nTHINK HE FOUND THE BOTTOM, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE'S GOING TO\nCLIMB BACK TO NEW ALL-TIME HIGHS.\n>> YOU KNOW, IF YOU LOOK BACK AT HISTORY, I THINK IT TOOK THE\nTITANIC TWO HOURS AND 40 MINUTES BEFORE IT SANK INTO THE OCEAN.\nWHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE IS THE COLLAPSE OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN,\nAND POSSIBLY EVEN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, IF THEY DON'T JUMP SHIP.\nWHAT WE SAW OVER THE WEEKEND WAS THAT MOST OF THE CREW MEMBERS,\nDOZENS OF CREW MEMBERS, ARE ABANDONING SHIP OR RUNNING FOR\nTHE LIFE BOATS. AND THE PEOPLE WHO AREN'T, YOU\nKNOW, THE RUDY GIULIANIS AND CHRIS CHRISTIES, I THINK THEY\nWILL SHARE A REDEEMABLE SHAME FOR STICKING BY A CANDIDATE WHO\nHAS NOT ONLY NO CHANCE OF WINNING, BUT NO CHANCE OF\nBRINGING ANY SORT OF RESPECT TO HIS CAMPAIGN OR TO THE PARTY IN\nTHE REMAINING 29 DAYS. I JUST THINK IT'S DEPLORABLE\nWHAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW, AND I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO GET\nANY BETTER. >> I WOULDN'T WRITE HIS\nCANDIDACY OFF. WE HAVE A MONTH.\nCRAZY YEAR, SO WE CAN'T PREDICT THE UNPREDICTABLE, BUT I DO WANT\nTO PICK UP SOMETHING THAT KEITH IS IMPLYING.\nKEITH AND I HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR A LONG TIME.\nI DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS ABOUT THE UNITED STATES IN 2016.\nBUT I BEMOAN THE LOSS OF CIVILITY BETWEEN PEOPLE, ALL\nRIGHT, I'VE KNOWN THIS GUY, WE DISAGREE ON A LOT OF THINGS.\nTHAT DOESN'T MEAN WE SIT AROUND INSULTING EACH OTHER ON THE AIR.\nTHE SAME THING AS MY PAL AUSTAN GOOLSBEE AND OTHERS, ALL RIGHT,\nINCLUDING REPUBLICANS, WHO WE'VE HAD BATTLES OVER THIS TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN. I BEG FOR SOME THOUGHT ABOUT\nRETURNING TO CIVILITY, WHERE WE CAN HAVE DEBATES, WE CAN HAVE\nDISCUSSIONS WITHOUT INSULTING, WITHOUT PERSONALIZING IT.\nI JUST THINK THIS IS A PROBLEM IN MODERN DAY AMERICAN CULTURE,\nIT'S A PROBLEM IN MODERN DAY POLITICS.\nCAN WE NOT BE CIVIL, EVEN WHEN WE DISAGREE?\nI BELIEVE WE CAN, AND I JUST THINK THAT'S MISSING FROM THIS\nWHOLE STORY. >> ONE LAST QUESTION, I AGREE\nWITH YOU COMPLETELY, BUT WHY DON'T YOU TELL THIS TO DONALD\nTRUMP? HE'S THE LEAST CIVIL CANDIDATE\nI'VE SEEN IN ANY MAJOR PARTY NOMINEE IN MY ENTIRE LIFETIME,\nAND I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING POLITICS CLOSELY FOR DECADES.\n>> I'M ASSUMING YOU HAVE, LARRY, YOU HAVE SAID THAT.\n>> WELL, I ALWAYS KEEP MY PERSONAL ADVICE PERSONAL, BUT I\nWILL SAY THIS, THERE ARE NO HEROS HERE.\nMRS. CLINTON IS NOT A HERO, MR. TRUMP IS NOT A HERO, AND IN THE\nREPUBLICAN DEBATE SOME OF THAT STUFF WAS INCREDIBLE.\nI'VE BEEN AROUND A WHILE, I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT.\nI DON'T THINK IT'S HOPELESS AS KEITH DOES, BUT I AGREE SHE HAS\nTHE UPPER HAND. I'M MAKING A DIFFERENT POINT,\nTHE PUBLIC NEEDS SOME INFORMATION, SOME EDUCATION.\nTHE PUBLIC NEEDS TO FIND A WAY OUT.\nTHE ECONOMY HAS UNDERPERFORMED, NOT SINCE 1929, BUT SINCE WORLD\nWAR II. THE ECONOMY HAS UNDERPERFORMED,\nEVERYBODY AGREES ON THAT. THE QUESTION IS, WHAT ARE YOU\nGOING TO DO ABOUT THAT? AND ON AND ON.\nBUT CAN WE NOT HAVE THIS AS A CIVIL DISCUSSION?\nTHAT'S ALL I'M ASKING. CAN WE NOT SHOW SOME RESPECT FOR\nEACH OTHER? YOU AND I DON'T ALWAYS SEE\nTHINGS THE SAME WAY, BUT WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS FOR 20 YEARS.\n>> LARRY, THAT STARTS BY YOU DISTANCING YOURSELF FROM THIS\nCANDIDATE. YOU HAVE TO SAY CLEARLY THAT\nDONALD TRUMP'S BEHAVIOR IS NOT THE SAME AS HILLARY CLINTON'S.\nTHAT'S A FALSE EQUIVALENT. WE NEVER HAD A CANDIDATE BEFORE\nTHAT ACCUSES HIS O FOENT OF BEING INVOLVED IN THE\nASSASSINATION OF ANOTHER PRESIDENT, WHO ENGAGES IN LOCKER\nROOM TALK AND DISMISSES IT THE WAY THIS GUY DOES, AND YOU HAVE\nDEFENDED HIM EVEN BEFORE THIS TAPE CAME OUT.\nYOU KNEW THIS, LARRY, AND YOU CONTINUED TO DEFEND HIM.\nIT'S TIME FOR YOU, LARRY, AS A PERSON WHO I RESPECT, TO STAND\nUP AND SAY YOU WILL NOT TOLERATE THIS, YOU WILL CALL FOR DONALD\nTRUMP TO SUSPEND HIS CAMPAIGN OR AT LEAST END THIS BEHAVIOR.\n>> NO, I WON'T. >> IT IS BRINGING DOWN HIS\nCAMPAIGN AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\n>> ALL RIGHT, I HEAR YOU. >> YOU ARE A GOOD PERSON, YOU\nKNOW BETTER, LARRY. >> I HAVE DEFENDED HIS ECONOMIC\nPLAN. >> YOU CANNOT DEFEND HIS\nBEHAVIOR. >> I CANNOT.\nBUT I THINK MRS. CLINTON IS ALSO --\n>> NOWHERE NEAR EQUIVALENT. >> I THINK SHE'S SAID SOME\nREALLY BAD THINGS ON BOTH SIDES. I THINK THERE'S -- IT'S LIKE\nTHERE'S SOMETHING IN THE WATER THIS YEAR.\nI DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. I DON'T WANT TO GO THIS FAR.\nLOOK, I DO A RADIO SHOW ON SATURDAYS FOR A COUPLE THREE\nHOURS AND I PREPARE FOR IT FRIDAY NIGHT, AND I PREPARE FOR\nIT SATURDAY MORNING. I WAS PRETTY CLOSE TO THE EDGE.\nI WOULDN'T ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. I WAS PRETTY CLOSE TO THE EDGE.\nMY FRIEND MIKE PENCE, WHO I'VE KNOWN FOR MANY, MANY, MANY YEARS\nREFUSED TO BACK TRUMP ON THAT, AS MANY OTHERS, PAUL RYAN, BUT I\nJUST SORT OF SAID, LOOK, I'M GOING TO MAKE MY CRITICISM.\nI THINK THIS IS WORSE THAN LOCKER ROOM HUMOR.\nI GET THAT. I THINK MRS. CLINTON'S BEEN\nPRETTY ROUGH, TOO, SHE'S SAID A LOT OF THINGS SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE\nSAID, DEPLORABLES AND WHAT NOT. I DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH THAT.\nI'M TRYING TO FIND THE UPSIDE TO THE DOWNSIDE.\nYES, I'M A TAX CUTTING SUPPLY SIDER AND TRUMP IS THERE AND SHE\nIS NOT. OKAY, THAT'S NOT BREAKING NEWS.\nI'M JUST RAISING THE BIGGER POINT, WHICH I AGREE WITH YOU.\nWE'VE GOT TO REINTRODUCE CIVILITY AND CALMNESS AND\nRESPECT TO EACH OTHER, SO WE CAN HAVE OUR POLICY DEBATES, WE CAN\nMAKE AMERICA A BETTER PLACE, OKAY.\nAND THAT'S ALL I WANT. JUST MAKE AMERICA -- I WANT IT\nBACK AT THE TOP. I WANT IT TO BE NUMBER ONE.\nI'D GO BACK TO REAGAN SITTING ON THE HILL, WE'VE HAD FAILURES\nEVERYWHERE, BUT WE CAN FIX THIS. I'VE BEEN IN ADMINISTRATION THAT\nFIXED IT. WE JUST GOT TO GET THAT DONE,\nAND I WILL AGREE WITH YOU HERE, SIR, WE'RE NOT GETTING IT DONE.\nI AGREE WITH YOU. >> SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO\nWRITE IN PENCE, I'M NOT SAYING THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO,\nBUT SURE SOUNDS LIKE IT. >> WELL, YOU KNOW ME, TODAY'S\nMONDAY. WE HAVE FOUR MORE WEEKS TO GO.\nI HOPE MR. TRUMP GETS HIS ACT TOGETHER, BECAUSE I DO AGREE\nWITH HIS ECONOMIC POLICY. I HAD A HAND IN IT, BUT I AGREE\nWITH IT, I THINK IT'S PRO GROWTH, I DON'T THINK MRS.\nCLINTON'S IS. >> AS WE'RE SPEAKING, POLITICO\nREPORTING SPEAKER RYAN TELLING HOUSE REPUBLICANS HE WON'T\nDEFEND TRUMP AND WILL FOCUS THE NEXT 29 DAYS ON KEEPING THE\nHOUSE. >> VERY IMPORTANT, BY THE WAY,\nBECAUSE FROM ABOUT FRIDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH SUNDAY\nAFTERNOON, I THINK PENCE AND RYAN WERE ESSENTIALLY ABOUT TO\nJUMP SHIP WITH CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES.\n>> SOUNDS LIKE RYAN STILL IS. HIM SAYING HE WON'T DEFEND\nTRUMP, NOT LIKE HE'S BEEN DEFENDING TRUMP ON ANYTHING UP\nTO THIS POINT, AND THAT LANGUAGE ABOUT FOCUSING ON HOUSE ECHOES\nSOME OF THE RUMORS OVER THE WEEKEND ABOUT WHAT THE RNC WAS\nPREPARED TO DO. SO IT SOUNDS A BIT MORE LIKE A\nWARNING SHOT THAN ANY PARTICULAR NEW NEWS.\n>> I AGREE WITH THAT. I THINK TRUMP'S PERFORMANCE LAST\nNIGHT, WHICH WAS MUCH BETTER THAN EXPECTATIONS, HE HAD GOOD\nPOINTS, VERY GOOD POINTS, SAVED THAT, BUT YOUR BIGGER POINT WITH\nRESPECT TO PAUL RYAN, ALSO AN OLD AND DEAR FRIEND, THEY ARE\nGOING TO FOCUS ON THE DOWN TICKET.\nTHEY WANT TO KEEP THE HOUSE AND TRY TO KEEP THE SENATE.\nI THINK THEY HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF KEEPING THE HOUSE, I THINK\nTHE SENATE IS A REAL TOSSUP, SO I'M BEING REALISTIC HERE, BUT\nYOU'RE GOING TO SEE THAT. YOU HAVE A LOT OF SENATORS\nJUMPING SHIP, I UNDERSTAND THAT, THEY HAVE RACES TO RUN.\nTHE MONEY STORY, I THINK, IS GOING TO BE FILTERED TOWARDS THE\nHOUSE AND SENATE CANDIDATES, AND, YOU KNOW, KEITH, I DO NOT\nWANT TO NATIONALIZE HEALTH CARE. I JUST DON'T.\nI'D RATHER CUT TAXES THAN RAISE THEM.\nI CAN'T HELP MYSELF. YOU KNOW I BELIEVE THAT.\n>> YEAH, SURPRISING THING, I AGREE WITH YOU ON THE CIVILITY\nPOINT. WE DISAGREE ON THE POLICY POINT,\nBUT I'M NOT CONFIDENT THAT DONALD TRUMP COMPLETELY AGREES\nWITH YOU ON THE POLICY ISSUES, BECAUSE HE'S BEEN A REMARKABLY\nUNDISCIPLINED POLICY CANDIDATE AND HE'S TALKED ABOUT TAX CUTS\nAND TAX REDUCTIONS. HE'S TALKED ABOUT RAISING TAXES\nON THE HIGH INCOME EARNERS, AT THE SAME TIME HE'S TALKED ABOUT\nLOWERING TAXES ON HIGH INCOME EARNERS AND ON ALL AMERICANS.\nI DON'T KNOW THAT HE'S ARTICULATED CONSISTENT POLICY\nPOSITIONS. AND GOING BACK TO JOHN'S POINT,\nSEEMS TO ME THE ONE THING THAT PEOPLE IN THIS BUILDING, THE ONE\nTHING THE MARKETS IN GENERAL CARE ABOUT IS SOME SORT OF\nCERTAINTY. DONALD TRUMP IS GIVING US\nOPPORTUNITIES FOR FOUR YEARS OR EIGHT YEARS OF UNCERTAINTY, AND\nI DON'T THINK THE WORLD IS READY FOR THAT.\nI DON'T THINK THE MARKETS ARE READY FOR THAT, I DON'T THINK\nNATO IS READY FOR THAT, I DON'T THINK OUR ALLIES ARE READY FOR\nTHAT. I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT\nPOTENTIAL DISASTER IF DONALD TRUMP IS ELECTED PRESIDENT, AND\nI THINK IN YOUR HEART OF HEARTS, LARRY, YOU KNOW THAT, TOO.\n>> WELL, LOOK, I LIKE THERAPY SESSIONS.\n>> WE'RE HAVING INTERVENTIONS. >> I ESPECIALLY LIKE GROUP\nTHERAPY, I FOUND IT VERY HELPFUL.\nNO, I BELIEVE IN MY PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS AND SO FORTH THAT\nMR. TRUMP IS A TAX CUTTING SUPPLY SIDER.\nI BELIEVE HE IS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES.\nI THINK HE IS FOR LOWER REGULATORY CUTS ACROSS THE\nBOARD. I'VE ALWAYS HAD SOME PROBLEMS\nWITH HIM ON TRADE. I AGREE ABOUT ENFORCEMENT OF\nTRADE DEALS, BUT I FIND MYSELF MUCH MORE OF A FREE TRADER THAN\nHE IS. WE'LL JUST SEE.\nI BELIEVE HE'S SINCERE. AS I SAID EARLIER, I LIKE TO SEE\nHIM SELL HIS ECONOMIC GROWTH PLANS.\nI DO NOT AGREE WITH MRS. CLINTON.\nLOOK, I'M JUST TRYING TO TELL YOU, YOU KNOW, I CALL THEM AS I\nSEE THEM, I'VE TRIED TO DO THAT MY WHOLE LIFE.\nI'M NOT LOOKING FOR JOBS. I'M PERFECTLY HAPPY HERE AT\nCNBC. THIS IS A DIFFICULT MOMENT AND\nI'M BEING AS HONEST WITH YOU ALL AS I CAN.\nHONESTLY. >> WE THANK YOU, LARRY, AND YOU,\nKEITH, COMING IN AND HAVING A REALLY GOOD 20-MINUTE DISCUSSION\nABOUT THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE OF THE DAY.\nCIVIL ONE. THANK YOU, GUYS.\nKEITH BOYKIN AND LARRY KUDLOW.",

I THINK THAT GIVEN THE HEATED\nNATURE OF THE DEBATE, THERE WERE A LOT OF INSULTS, A LOT OF BACK\nBITING, IT TOOK ON THE DIMENSIONS OF A FEUD.\nSHE KEPT CONTROL, HOWEVER SHE MISSED SOME OPPORTUNITIES TO\nCONNECT WITH THE AUDIENCE MEMBERS WHO WERE ASKING THE\nQUESTIONS AND THAT'S ANOTHER PART OF THIS TOWN HALL FORMAT\nTHAT SHE COULD HAVE USED TO HER BENEFIT.\n>> EXAMPLE? >> WELL, THE YOUNG MUSLIM WOMAN\nSPOKE UP ABOUT ISLAMOPHOBIA AND SHE CALLED IT -- AND WHAT WOULD\nTHE CANDIDATES DO ABOUT THAT.

FOR MORE ON WHAT TO DO WITH\nSTOCKS AT THIS POINT, LET'S BRING IN RONALD O' HANLEY, AND\nTOBIAS LEKOVITCH. DIDN'T INVESTORS LEARN THEIR\nLESSON WITH BREXIT THAT YOU CAN'T GET TOO EXCITED ABOUT ONE\nOUTCOME OR THE OTHER BY WATCHING POLLS?\n>> UNFORTUNATELY, I'M NOT SURE THEY WERE THAT EXCITED IN\nWATCHING LAST NIGHT ANYWAY. BUT I THINK THE -- IT'S\nINTERESTING WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE MARKET.\nI THINK MOST PEOPLE VIEW DONALD TRUMP HAD TO HAVE A KNOCKOUT\nBLOW, PROBABLY DIDN'T DO IT AND AS A RESULT, YOU KNOW, THE\nPROBABILITIES OF A CLINTON VICTORY CONTINUE TO GAIN SOME\nTRACTION ON THE STREET. AND IT'S ALSO INTERESTING THAT\nENERGY'S LEADING PARTIALLY BECAUSE OF THE OPEC NEWS TODAY.\nBUT ALSO IF YOU LOOK AT THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE HILLARY\nCLINTON VICTORY, IT WOULD POTENTIALLY PUT MORE OF AN\nENVIRONMENTAL KIND OF CLOUD, IF YOU LIKE, OVER SHALE ACTIVITY IN\nTHE U.S. AND THAT WOULD PROPEL AND PROP\nUP LOW PRICES GOOD FOR THE SECTOR IN TERMS OF STOCK PRICE\nPERFORMANCE. >> MAYBE ONE OF THE REASONS\nBEHIND THE RALLY. RONALD, YOU'VE GOT A FRONT ROW\nSEAT TO RETAIL INVESTORS WITH YOUR BIG ETF BUSINESS.\nWHAT ARE YOU SEEING IN TERMS OF THE FLOWS AND HOW INVESTORS ARE\nCOPING WITH HEIGHTENED UNCERTAINTY, SORT OF AN OVERUSED\nWORD RIGHT NOW, BUT CLEARLY THAT'S HOW THEY SEE THIS\nELECTION. >> WELL, I THINK THAT'S RIGHT.\nAND I THINK THAT MUCH OF INVESTOR SENTIMENT IS DRIVEN BY\nCERTAINTY OR UNCERTAINTY. I THINK PROBABLY WHAT YOU'RE\nSEEING TODAY TO SOME SENSE THAT THE OUTCOME OF ELECTION MAY BE\nMORE CERTAIN. I DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARILY A\nVALUE JUDGMENT ON EITHER CANDIDATE MORE SO THAN WITH SOME\nCERTAINTY PEOPLE CAN MAKE SOME INVESTMENT I KNOW YOU LIKE\nENERGY AND JUST MENTIONED IT, YOU AO SAY IN A RECENT NOTE\nTHE BOND PROXY GROUPS ARE GOING TO RAISE IN THE FACE.\nWE'VE SEEN TELECOM WEAK AGAIN TODAY.\nWHAT MORE DAMAGE DO YOU EXPECT? >> A NUMBER STILL LOOK\nUNATTRACTIVELY VALUED, STAPLES WHICH YOU DIDN'T MENTION, MANY\nOF THOSE STOCKS ARE AT HIGH LEVELS HISTORICALLY VALUATION\nPERSPECTIVE. ON A P/E BASIS PROBABLY 25-YEAR\nHIGHS A FEW WEEKS AGO. AND, AGAIN, ON A VALUATION PERSPECTIVE.\nIT'S MORE ABOUT THESE COMPANIES HAVING REALLY RALLIED ALREADY OR\nTHESE STOCKS HAVEN'T REALLY RALLIED, THEIR VALUATIONS\nSTRETCHED, EARNINGS GROWTH MODEST 3%, 4%, 5%, AND YET\nPEOPLE PRICING THEM AS IF THEY'RE GOING 20%.\nTHAT'S THE DISCOMFORT AREA. YOU'RE RIGHT, WE DO THINK THE\nBOND YIELDS CAN BE MOVING HIGHER.\nTHE FED SEEMS TO BE WANTING TO DO SOMETHING MORE POSITIVELY.\nWE ALSO SEE THE LONG END OF THE YIELD CURVE TRACK UP AS DATA HAS\nBEEN BETTER. ISM NUMBERS IN AUGUST WERE WEAK,\nIN SEPTEMBER RECOVERED. THAT'S CONTINUE TO SEE THE\nLIKELIHOOD OF SOME IMPROVED TRENDS.\nAGAIN, HIRING'S BEEN OKAY. IT'S NOT BEEN PHENOMENAL, BUT\nIT'S OKAY. WE'RE NOT LOSING JOBS.\n>> AND YET ON THE OTHER SIDE, RONALD, YOU'VE SEEN INVESTORS\nPOURING INTO FIXED ETFs THIS YEAR, WHERE ARE THEY GOING?\nWHAT ARE THEY BETTING ON IN TERMS OF RATES?\nAND HOW VULNERABLE ARE THEY IF WE DO CONTINUE TO SEE RISING\nRATES AS TOBIAS FORECASTS? >> WELL, I THINK WHAT INVESTORS\nARE SEEKING IS AN INCOME IN YIELD.\nAND AS YOU'VE SEEN INTEREST RATES DECLINE AND STAY AT A NEAR\nZERO LEVEL, THE TRADITIONAL INVESTMENT APPROACH OF THOSE\nNEAR RETIREMENT OF RELYING ON TRADITIONAL SAVINGS VEHICLES\nJUST ISN'T WORKING. WHAT YOU'RE SEEING INVESTORS\nRECOGNIZING THEY NEED SOME KIND OF PROTECTION TO PRINCIPLE BUT\nNEED MORE YIELD THAN THEY WOULD OTHERWISE GET.\nSO I THINK THE INDUSTRY'S WORKING VERY HARD TO EDUCATE\nTHESE INVESTORS THAT IN A RISING RATE ENVIRONMENT THERE ACTUALLY\nIS A RISK TO PRINCIPLE. BUT WHAT YOU'RE SEEING HERE IS A\nNATURAL OUTCOME FROM A NEAR ZERO INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT.\n>> AND, TOBIAS, ARE YOU A BUYER OF THE BANKS ON THIS RISING\nINTEREST RATE THEORY? >> WE LIKE THE BANKS.\nWE LIKE THE DIVERSIFIED FINANCIALS WITHIN THE FINANCIALS\nAREA. WE HAVE INSURANCE ON UPGRADE\nWATCH CURRENTLY MARKET WEIGHT THERE.\nLOOK, I THINK IT'S PARTIALLY DUE TO THAT, BUT THERE'S ALSO A\nSTEEPENING OF THE YIELD CURVE WE WERE ALREADY SEEING, LOAN\nACTIVITY STILL DECENT. SO THEY CAN EARN SOME MONEY.\nAND INVESTORS ON A VALUATION BASIS HAVE PRETTY MUCH THROWN IN\nTHE TOWEL ON THESE STOCKS GENERATING SOME OPPORTUNITY.\n>> ALL RIGHT.

IN TERMS OF THE BROADER STOCK\nMARKET. NOT SO MUCH REACTION, I'M\nWONDERING IF YOU THINK IT IS BECAUSE -- I DON'T WANT TO SAY\nIT DOESN'T MAT, BUT DOESN'T MATTER AS MUCH ON THE DAY TO DAY\nBASIS FOR THE EQUITY MARKETS OR IF THE 1.7ISH PERCENT RISE WE\nHAVE SEEN DOES REFLECT THE ELECTIONS?\n>> WELL, I THINK THAT THE IMPROVEMENT WE SEE IS MORE A\nFUNCTION OF BETTER ECONOMIC INDICATORS.\nTHE THING ABOUT THE ELECTION IS IT IS NOT THAT IT DOESN'T\nMATTER, NOT CLEAR IT IS GOING TO MATTER FOR THE BROADER MARKET.\nTHERE ARE SEGMENTS OF THE MARKET, HEALTH CARE COMPANIES,\nENERGY COMPANIES, THEY THINK THEY WILL BE IMPACTED BY THE\nRESULTS OF THE ELECTION. BUT IF YOU GO BACK, YOU LOOK AT\nHISTORY, THE OCCUPANT OF THE WHITE HOUSE IS NOT RELIABLY\nDRIVEN THE MARKET AND IN ADDITION, IF WE GET THE MOST\nLIKELY OUTCOME, WHICH IS PROBABLY SOMEWHAT OF A\nCONTINUATION OF THE STATUS QUO, AND YOU'RE STILL LOOKING AT A\nDIVIDED GOVERNMENT, IT MAY NOT HAVE AS MUCH OF AN IMPACT ON THE\nMARKET, THE BROAD LEVEL, AS SOME SUGGESTED.\n>> YOU SAY IMPACT ON HEALTH CARE AS WELL AS ENERGY, IT IS\nINTERESTING BECAUSE HEALTH CARE, IT SEEMS LIKE BOTH SIDES OF THE\nAISLE ARE IN FAVOR OF PRICE CONTROLS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT,\nPERHAPS MORE REGULATION WHEN IT COMES TO ENERGY.\nMAY BE A TRUMP WIN THAT MAY BENEFIT THE ENERGY SECTOR.\nHOW DO YOU PARSE OUT THE IMPACT OF EITHER CANDIDATE ON THESE LAR\nSECTORS SINCE YOU FLAGGED THEM AS THE MOST IMPACTED?\n>> HEALTH CARE IS A REALLY INTERESTING EXAMPLE BECAUSE EVEN\nWITHIN HEALTH CARE, THERE ARE NUANCES.\nIF YOU THINK ABOUT THE PHARMA SECTOR AND BIOTECH, THEY HAVE\nBOTH COME UNDER SOME PRESSURE DEPENDING UPON COMMENTS OUT OF\nTHE CANDIDATES ABOUT DRUG PRICING.\nTHE SAME TIME, IF YOU BELIEVE THAT THE ELECTION WILL RESULT IN\nTHE CONTINUATION OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, THAT STANDS\nTO BENEFIT SOME SERVICE PROVIDERS, SOME HOSPITALS, SO IT\nIS WORTH FOCUSING ON SECTORS, BUT WITHIN THE SECRETARY, EXPECT\nSOME DIFFERENTIATION DEPENDING UPON THE NATURE OF THE BUSINESS,\nAND HOW WASHINGTON AFFECTS THEIR REVENUE AND BOTTOM LINE.\n>> ROSS, OIL BACK ABOVE $51 A BARREL.\nHOW IMPORTANT IS ENERGY'S RUN? JUST SORT OF TALKED ABOUT THE\nINDUSTRY IN GENERAL, BUT HOW IMPORTANT IS OIL'S MOVE TO THE\nOVERALL MARKET, IF ONE OF OUR VIEWERS JUST OWNS THE S&P ETF,\nIS THIS GOOD NEWS? >> I THINK IT IS NEUTRAL.\nIT IS PROBABLY HELPING TO SUPPORT THE CONTINUATION OF THE RALLY AND HIGH YIELD.\nIN JANUARY, THE COLLAPSE IN ENERGY WAS ONE OF THE THINGS\nTHAT SCARED PEOPLE ABOUT CREDIT. CERTAINLY IT IS GOOD FOR THE OIL\nCOMPANIES, AND VERY GOOD FOR THE U.S. BASED COMPANIES.\nWHERE IT MIGHT HURT IS ON THE CONSUMER SIDE.\nONE OF THE ARGUMENTS FOR RETAIL COMPANIES IS YOU HAD THIS WIN\nFALL FROM LOWER OIL. WE START TO SEE IT BACK UP IN\nGASOLINE, PARTICULARLY AT A TIME WHEN WAGES ARE NOT RIPPING TO\nTHE UPSIDE, THAT MIGHT PUT A LITTLE MORE DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON\nRETAIL STOCKS AND PERHAPS SOME RESTAURANTS AS WELL.\n>> ROSS, DO YOU THINK EITHER CANDIDATE HAS A PARTICULAR\nIMPACT ON INTEREST RATES? >> WELL, CERTAINLY IF YOU HAVE\nHILLARY CLINTON WINNING, IT IS FAIR TO ASSUME THERE WILL BE\nCONTINUITY AT THE FED. WHAT IS CONTINUITY AT THE FED?\nLOOKS LIKE MORE OF THE SAME, THE FED IS LIKELY TO GO IN DECEMBER.\nBUT AS WE HAVE BEEN REMINDED AGAIN AND AGAIN, THIS WILL BE A\nVERY GRADUAL AND PROBABLY SOMEWHAT OF A SHORT TIGHTENING\nCYCLE WHICH MEANS THAT THE TERMINAL LEVEL YOU GET TO, WHEN\nTHE FED STOPS RAISING RATES, IS GOING TO BE DRAMATICALLY LOWER\nTHAN THE SPIN IN PREVIOUS CYCLES.\n>> ALL RIGHT, ROSS, WE'LL LEAVE IT THERE.\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. >> LET'S TURN BACK TO THE\nPOLITICAL IMPLICATIONS NOW, AND WITH US IS DON PEEBLES, CHAIRMAN\nAND CEO OF THE PEEBLES CORPORATION.\nALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU. I'M SURE WE'LL GET TO WHO YOU\nTHOUGHT WON AND LOST THE DEBATE IN A MINUTE.\nBUT I THOUGHT THAT ONE OF THE INTERESTING AREAS OF\nCONVERSATION LAST NIGHT, AN AREA WITH WHICH OF THE TAX CODE WITH\nWHICH I'M SURE YOU'RE FAMILIAR IS A REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER HAS\nTO DO WITH MR. TRUMP'S USE, MAYBE SOME WOULD SAY AGGRESSIVE\nUSE OF NET OPERATING LOSS CARRY FORWARDS.\nI DON'T WANT TO BOG DOWN IN THE WEEDS HERE, BUT I'M CURIOUS WHAT\nYOU THINK ABOUT HIS USE OF THAT TAX PROVISION, WHETHER YOU DRAW\nANY MORAL JUDGMENT ABOUT IT, WHETHER YOU'VE HAD TO USE IT IN\nYOUR CAREER, AND HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT IT.\n>> OKAY, WELL, LOOK, FIRST OF ALL, THERE IS NO MORAL JUDGMENT\nHERE. THAT'S THE LAW.\nTHAT'S THE TAX CODE THAT WE HAVE TODAY.\nTHAT WAS THE TAX CODE IN PLACE BACK THEN WHEN HE TOOK THE\nLOSSES. THAT TAX CODE IS DESIGNED TO\nSPUR INVESTMENT IN BUSINESSES. SO MY BUSINESSES WILL LOSE MONEY\nIN CERTAIN TYPES OF ENTITIES OF OURS WILL LOSE MONEY.\nIF WE COULDN'T OFFSET THAT AGAINST THE GAINS, WE WOULD BE\nMUCH LESS LIKELY TO TAKE THE RISK.\nOF COURSE IT IS AN APPROPRIATE DEDUCTION.\nI THINK THAT THIS NARRATIVE ON THAT ISSUE IN PARTICULAR IS\nTRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LACK OF DETAIL KNOWLEDGE OF THE\nGENERAL PUBLIC AS A WHOLE. BUT AS A BUSINESS PERSON, I\nDON'T SEE ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT.\nI KNOW MOST BUSINESS PEOPLE WILL -- AND WHO WOULDN'T TAKE\nADVANTAGE OF BEING ABLE TO DEDUCT AN EXPENSE?\nTHE AVERAGE AMERICAN TAKES FULL ADVANTAGE OF ANY DEDUCTION THEY\nHAVE AS WELL. >> JOHN, IT IS MICHELLE HERE.\nYOU'RE A CLINTON SUPPORTER, RIGHT?\n>> NO. I AM AN INDEPENDENT PERSON RIGHT\nNOW. I WOULD LEAN TOWARDS HILLARY\nCLINTON. BUT I HAVE NOT MADE A DECISION\nTO ENDORSE EITHER CANDIDATE. I WAS A BARACK OBAMA SUPPORTER\nFOR BOTH OF HIS ELECTIONS AND CONTINUE TO BE ONE FOR HIM.\nBUT NO, I AM NOT -- I HAVE NOT ENDORSED EITHER CANDIDATE.\n>> TO UNDERLINE, YOU DON'T SEE ANYTHING THEN NEFARIOUS IN THIS\nCONTACTING PROCEDURE. >> HE LOST A HUGE AMOUNT OF\nMONEY. WE GOT TO REWIND AND THINK ABOUT\nWHAT WAS HAPPENING TO THE COUNTRY AT THAT TIME.\nLOOK, IN THE EARLY 1990s, WE HAD A BANKING CRISIS THAT BROUGHT\nDOWN THE BANKING INDUSTRY, THE SAVINGS AND LOAN INDUSTRY ENDED.\nAND CLOSED UP FROM WHAT WE KNEW THEN TO WHAT IT IS TODAY.\nWE HAD A REAL ESTATE CRISIS WHERE VALUES WERE PLUMMETING AND\nWE HAD THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TAKING CONTROL OF BANKS ON AN\nEVERYDAY BASIS. SO THERE WERE HUGE LOSSES.\nANYONE IN REAL ESTATE SUFFERED HUGE LOSSES.\n>> DID YOU HAVE CLOSE TO A BILLION DOLLAR LOSS, DON?\n>> I DIDN'T. >> DID YOU KNOW ANYBODY WHO HAS\nHAD ONE? >> WELL, LOOK, DONALD TRUMP\nAPPARENTLY HAD ONE AS WELL. I DON'T -- I THINK WE'RE AGAIN\nFOCUSING ON THE SIZE. SIZE IS RELATIVE.\nIF YOU'RE RUNNING A $20 BILLION BUSINESS, AND YOU LOSE A BILLION\nDOLLARS, THAT'S A 5% LOSS. IF YOU RUN A MILLION DOLLAR\nBUSINESS, AND YOU LOSE $50,000, THAT'S A 5% LOSS.\nSO IT HAS GOT TO BE RELATIVE HERE.\nI THINK THAT'S THE OTHER THING. AGAIN, IT IS MORE FOCUSING ON\nTHE NARRATIVE, ON THE OPTICS AS OPPOSED TO THE SUBSTANCE OF IT.\nTHE LAW OF THE LAND IS HE COULD DEDUCT IT AND WE SHOULD -- IF\nPEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT, CHANGE THE TAX CODE.\n>> PLEASE DON'T MISTAKE ME WHEN I ASK THE QUESTION, WAS REALLY\nBECAUSE I WAS LEGITIMATELY CURIOUS BECAUSE YOU, AS A REAL\nESTATE DEVELOPER, HAVE TO BE FAMILIAR WITH THESE TAX\nPROVISIONS. I WASN'T FISHING FOR ANY\nPARTICULAR ANSWER. YOU GAVE MET HONEST ANSWER THE\nWAY YOU FEEL. LET ME TURN IT A LITTLE BIT\nDIFFERENTLY THERE, DOES IT IN ANY WAY TROUBLE YOU THAT AN\nINDIVIDUAL LIKE MR. TRUMP OR SOMEONE ELSE MIGHT GO FOR MANY\nYEARS AND NOT PAY ANY PERSONAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX AS A RESULT\nOF THE WAY THE TAX CODE IS STRUCTURED, THAT ALLOWS THOSE\nBUSINESS ORIENTED NET OPERATING LOSSES TO FLOW THROUGH TO THEIR\nPERSONAL TAX RETURN? DOES IT TROUBLE YOU AT ALL?\n>> NO. >> I'M ASKING, NOT BECAUSE I\nHAVE A JUDGMENT OF MY OWN ON IT. >> THEHE GOA ONLY ECONOMIC\nACTIVITY WE STIMULATE SHOULD NOT BE TAXES, IT IS JOB GENERATION.\nIT IS INCOME GROWTH FOR INDIVIDUALS.\nIT IS SPURRING SMALL BUSINESSES. IT IS BUILDING BUSINESSES AND\nTHE LIKE. SO, NO, WE HAVE TO INCENTIVIZE\nTHE PRIVATE SECTOR TO TAKE THE RISK.\nIF YOU TAKE RISK AND LOSE MONEY AND CAN'T WRITE IT OFF AGAINST\nPROFITABLE ENTERPRISES, IT JUST DISCOURAGES PEOPLE FROM MAKING\nSMART INVESTMENTS. THAT'S COMMON SENSE.\n>> I HATE TO USE THE WORDS WON OR LOST WITH THE DEBATE.\nTHERE IS SO MUCH NUANCE OUT THERE, RIGHT.\nIT IS WIN AND LOSE IS A STATE OF\nMIND DEPENDING WHO YOU ARE. DO YOU BELIEVE DONALD TRUMP\nSTOPPED THE BLEEDING? DO YOU THINK HE HELD HIS GROUND\nENOUGH LAST NIGHT TO CEASE THE DECLINE IN THE POLLS THAT JOHN\nHARWOOD HIT ON ABOUT TEN MINUTES AGO?\n>> LET ME PUT IT TO YOU THIS WAY.\nHAD HE HAD THAT PERFORMANCE IN THE FIRST DEBATE, THIS RACE\nWOULD BE A LOT CLOSER. I THINK HE STOPPED THE BLEEDING.\nI THOUGHT HE FINALLY OVERALL, 90% OF HIS PRESENCE ON TV LAST\nNIGHT SHOWED THAT HE WAS AT LEAST REMOTELY WORTHY OF BEING\nON THE STAGE TO COMPETE FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES.\nSO I THOUGHT HE DID A FAR BETTER JOB.\nIF I WERE GOING TO PICK A WINNER OF THAT, I WOULD SAY HE DID DO A\nBETTER JOB IN TERMS OF GETTING HIS GOALS ACCOMPLISHED AND\nTALKING TO THOSE VOTERS WHO ARE STILL UNDECIDED.\n>> DID HE DO A GOOD ENOUGH JOB OF EXPLAINING HIS USE OF THE NET\nOPERATING LOSSES AS YOU DID HERE?\n>> NO, BUT I THOUGHT THAT THE MODERATORS WERE A BIT ONE SIDED,\nTO BE CANDID WITH YOU. AND, AGAIN, I'M PREDISPOSED TO\nHILLARY CLINTON. BUT HILLARY CAN WIN THIS RACE\nWITHOUT ANY HELP FROM THE MODERATORS.\nTHIS IS THE SECOND TIME NOW WHERE THE MODERATORS DON'T GIVE\nTHE OPPORTUNITY FOR ONE CANDIDATE TO ANSWER MORE SUBSTANTIVELY.\nI THOUGHT IT WAS A BILL UNBALANCED.\nSETTING WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH TO DO THAT.\nIT IS A MORE COMPLICATED QUESTION.\nRIGHT NOW, I'M TALKING TO A BUSINESS AUDIENCE, AND THEY GET\nIT. BUT THE AVERAGE AMERICAN DOESN'T\nGET IT UNLESS THEY'RE EXPLAINED IT, BUT THE SIMPLE IS THAT'S THE\nLAW OF THE LAND. >> DON, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR\nYOUR CANDOR. WE APPRECIATE IT.\nALWAYS GOOD TO HEAR FROM YOU.",

THEY HAVE TO TAKE IT IN ORDER TO\nCONTINUE TO SUSTAIN A PRICE MOVE.\nTHEY'VE GOT TO TAKE PRODUCTION DOWN TO 31.5 MILLION BARRELS PER\nDAY. THAT'S JUST NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.\nTHE IRANIANS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO PRODUCE AND INCREASE\nPRODUCTION. LIBYA IS COMING BACK ON STREAM.\nTHE FRACKERS ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE THERE.\nTHE RUSSIANS MAY ARGUE AND SAY THEY'RE GOING TO CONTINUE.\nTHEY'LL CURTAIL PRODUCTION FROM UNDER 11 MILLION BARRELS.\nTHEY WON'T DO IT AND THE SAUDIS WILL CONTINUOUSLY PRODUCE AS\nMUCH AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN. THEY WILL NOT ALLOW IRAN TO\nSTEAL MARKET SHARE FROM THEM. CAN'T HAPPEN.\n>> DENNIS, GOOD TO SEE YOU.

THE OIH ARE THE MOST LEVERED\nNAMES, MOST RELIED ON, MORE DRILLING.\nAND, AGAIN, I WOULD ARGUE THAT OPEC DOES NOT HAVE THIS BEAR\nCAPACITY THAT PEOPLE THINK THEY DO.\nSAUDI HAS GOT A 13% FISCAL  GO WITH THE LEVERED NAMES, OR\nESPECIALLY THE EUROPEAN NAMES BEATEN BY THE WEAKER EURO.\nWITH NICE DIP YIELDS. VALUATIONS ARE VERY INTERESTING.\n>> ARE YOU IN OIL RIGHT NOW, KAREN?\n>> NO, NOT REALLY. I -- GUY HAD A RIGHT CALL WITH\nAPC, WITH A REALLY NICE RUN SINCE THE SECONDARY.\nI WOULD ACTUALLY BE A LITTLE MORE AFRAID.\nI THINK THE LIKELIHOOD OF A DEAL FALLING APART IS ENOUGH TO MAKE\nTHOSE LEVERED ONES VERY RISKY. >> DO YOU WANT TO RISK THAT --\nTHE QUESTION IS ENTER EARNINGS FOR A NAME LIKE ANADARKO WHICH\nREPORTS ON HALLOWEEN TO 31st. DO YOU WANT TO RISK NOT BEING IN\nTHIS NAME OR BEING SHORT THIS NAME IN THE EARNINGS RELEASE?\nAND I THINK THE ANSWER IS NO. WHEN YOU LOOK AT APC WHICH\nBOUNCED OFF THE LEVEL WHERE THEY PRICED THAT SECONDARY, I THINK\nTHERE IS ROOM ON THE UP SIDE.

IT SEEMED TO BE THE LAST STRAW\nFOR MANY REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE SINCE ABANDONED THEIR CANDIDATE.\nDEBATE CO-MODERATOR MARTHA RADDATZ SAID IT BECAME THE\nSINGLE MOST TALKED-ABOUT STORY IN THE ENTIRE 2016 ELECTION ON\nFACEBOOK. HERE'S HOW TRUMP ADDRESSED IT\nLAST NIGHT. >> JUST FOR THE RECORD, THOUGH,\nARE YOU SAYING THAT WHAT YOU SAID ON THAT BUS 11 YEARS AGO\nTHAT YOU DID NOT ACTUALLY KISS WOMEN WITHOUT CONSENT OR GROPE\nWOMEN WITHOUT CONSENT? >> I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR\nWOMEN. NOBODY HAS MORE RESPECT FOR\nWOMEN THAN I DO. >> SO FOR THE RECORD, YOU ARE\nSAYING YOU NEVER DID THAT? >> I SAID THINGS THAT FRANKLY,\nYOU HEAR THESE THINGS. THEY'RE SAID.\nAND I WAS EMBARRASSED BY IT BUT I HAVE TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR\nWOMEN. >> HAVE YOU EVER DONE THOSE\nTHINGS? >> WOMEN HAVE RESPECT FOR ME.\nI WILL TELL YOU NO, I HAVE NOT. >> ALL RIGHT.\nSO TRUMP EVEN SEEMED TO SAY I'LL SEE YOUR LEAKED TAPE AND RAISE\nYOU BILL CLINTON'S PAST, BRINGING WOMEN WHO HAVE ACCUSED\nTHE FORMER PRESIDENT OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT INTO THE DEBATE HALL.\nLET'S TALK ABOUT ALL OF THIS WITH CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR\nAND TRUMP SUPPORTER JOHN PHILLIPS, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR\nTARA SETMEYER AND JENNIFER GRANHOLM, WHO IS SUPPORTING\nHILLARY CLINTON. WELCOME TO ALL OF YOU.\nJENNIFER, I WOULD LIKE TO START WITH YOU.\nMORE THAN ONE PERSON SAID THIS MORNING THAT THE PRESENCE OF\nTHESE THREE BILL CLINTON ACCUSERS RATTLED MRS. CLINTON\nONSTAGE LAST NIGHT. >> TOTALLY DISAGREE WITH THAT.\nI THINK THAT SHE WAS AS COOL AS A CUCUMBER.\nVERY, VERY SANE, VERY MEASURED. SHE COULD HAVE REALLY GONE AFTER\nHIM BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH AN INAPPROPRIATE THING FOR HIM TO\nDO AND TO RAISE. THERE'S A REASON WHY YOUR CNN\nPOLL SHOWS THAT WOMEN COMPLETELY HAVE A MUCH BETTER OPINION OF\nHER THAN HIM. IN FACT, OVERALL, HER\nFAVORABILITY AFTER THIS DEBATE LAST NIGHT WAS AT 54%.\nTRUMP'S FAVORABILITY WAS AT 34%. 64% OF PEOPLE RATED HIM\nUNFAVORABLY. I'M SURE THAT THIS TAPE, THAT\nTHE SPECTER OF HIM BRINGING THOSE WOMEN IN AS A DISTRACTION,\nWAS A BIG PART OF THAT. >> SO JOHN, SOME PEOPLE CALL\nBRINGING THESE WOMEN INTO THE DEBATE HALL DONALD TRUMP'S HAIL\nMARY PASS. IN YOUR MIND, DID HE SCORE A\nTOUCHDOWN? >> WELL, WITH ALL THE TALK OF\nAUDIOTAPES THAT ARE LEAKED AND WOMEN FROM THE PAST THAT SHOW\nUP, I SAY WE JUST GO ALL IN AND HAVE MAURY POVICH DO THE NEXT\nDEBATE. GET RID OF CHRIS WALLACE, PUT\nTHE KIDS IN BOOT CAMP AND GO DOWN THAT ROAD.\n>> WE ARE ALREADY THERE, JOHN. >> THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE A\nLONG TIME AGO. MORE LIKE JERRY SPRINGER.\n>> I THINK FOR TRUMP THIS WAS ALMOST THE INVERSE OF THE LAST\nDEBATE. THE LAST DEBATE I THOUGHT HIS\nSTRONGEST MOMENTS WERE THE FIRST 30 MINUTES WHEN HE WAS TALKING\nABOUT TRADE, WHEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMY.\nTHEN IT KIND OF ALL WENT DOWNHILL FROM THERE.\nIN THIS DEBATE, I THOUGHT HIS WEAKEST MOMENTS WERE THE FIRST\n20 MINUTES. I THOUGHT THE APOLOGY LEFT\nSOMETHING TO BE DESIRED. I THOUGHT HAVING THE WOMEN THERE\nDIDN'T REALLY SCORE THE POINTS I THOUGHT HE ASSUMED OUTSIDE OF\nGETTING IN HER HEAD WHICH I THINK IT DID.\nHIS STRONGEST MOMENTS WERE THE FINAL 60 MINUTES OF THE DEBATE\nWHEN HE WAS PIVOTING WHICH HE DIDN'T DO THE FIRST TIME.\nI THOUGHT WHAT HE DID WITH THE 3:00 A.M. QUESTION WAS GOOD,\nCONNECTING IT TO BENGHAZI. HE REALLY HAMMERED HER ON THE\nE-MAILS. HE WAS MUCH STRONGER AS THE\nDEBATE WENT ON LAST NIGHT. >> BUT HERE'S THE THING.\nHE IS LOSING BADLY WITH WOMEN, ESPECIALLY REPUBLICAN EDUCATED\nWHITE WOMEN. SO TARA --\n>> BIG LEAGUE. >> BIG LEAGUE.\n25 POINTS, HE'S LOSING THEM BY. DID HE SAY ANYTHING LAST NIGHT\nIN YOUR MIND, YOU ARE AN EDUCATED REPUBLICAN WOMAN, THAT\nWOULD CHANGE YOUR MIND ABOUT DONALD TRUMP?\n>> NO. I THINK I AGREE WITH JOHN ON HIS\nASSESSMENT ON TRUMP'S PERFORMANCE.\nI THINK THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ACTUALLY PREPARE SO I\nGUESS BEING HOLED UP IN TRUMP TOWER ON SATURDAY, HE WAS ABLE\nTO PREPARE BETTER FOR THIS DEBATE AND HE DEFINITELY PUT\nCLINTON BACK ON HER HEELS MORE THAN ONCE AND THAT'S THE\nFRUSTRATION FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE CONSERVATIVES LOOKING AT\nTRUMP AS OUR CANDIDATE, BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON IS SUCH A FLAWED\nCANDIDATE AND HAS SUCH A FAILED RECORD THAT IF WE HAD A\nREPUBLICAN THAT COULD ARTICULATE THAT CONSISTENTLY, THAT DIDN'T\nHAVE THE CHARACTER ISSUES AND THE INTEGRITY ISSUES THAT DONALD\nTRUMP HAS, WE WOULD BE WINNING BY 30.\nBUT WE DON'T. WE HAVE TRUMP.\nSO UNFORTUNATELY, I THINK WHAT HE'S DONE NOW WITH THAT TAPE ON\nFRIDAY IS JUST REALLY SOLIDIFIED THE VIEWPOINT THAT DONALD TRUMP\nIS UNFIT TEMPERAMENTALLY TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nTHAT DISPLAY IN THE FIRST 20 MINUTES LAST NIGHT WAS\nUNCOMFORTABLE, IT WAS UNSEEMLY AND I FELT IT WAS JUST BENEATH\nTHE DIGNITY OF THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY, AND I THINK IT WAS\nOFFPUTTING TO THE AVERAGE VOTER WHO WAS WATCHING THAT.\nI'M NOT SURE IF ANYTHING ELSE THAT HE SAYS POLICY-WISE WOULD\nGET THROUGH BECAUSE PEOPLE, HOW YOU PRESENT YOURSELF MATTERS.\nIT MATTERS HOW PEOPLE HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY.\n>> SO JENNIFER, IS THAT THE STRATEGY FOR HILLARY CLINTON\nGOING FORWARD? THERE'S ALREADY A WEB CAM AD OUT\nAND IT'S ON THE WOMAN ISSUE, RIGHT, IT'S NOT ON THE TAX\nISSUE. IT'S NOT ON WHAT HE SAID ABOUT\nSYRIA THAT DIFFERS FROM MIKE PENCE.\nIT'S NOT ON THAT. IT'S ABOUT THE WOMAN ISSUE.\nSO THAT GOING FORWARD, IS THAT HILLARY CLINTON'S STRATEGY,\nBECAUSE SOME OF THE ANSWERS SHE GAVE LAST NIGHT SURROUNDING HER\nE-MAIL CONTROVERSY AND WHETHER SHE THOUGHT PRIVATELY ABOUT\nTHINGS IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAN SHE SAID PUBLICLY, THAT WASN'T A\nGREAT ANSWER EITHER. >> WELL, I DISAGREE WITH YOU ON\nTHAT. I THINK RAISING THE SPECTER,\nFIRST OF ALL, I WOULD SAY THAT HER STRATEGY IS NOT JUST TO\nFOCUS ON WOMEN. SHE SAID FROM THE VERY\nBEGINNING, THE FIRST ANSWER WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER AND SHE\nTALKED ABOUT ALL OF THE BUFFET OF DISCRIMINATORY AND HATEFUL\nSTATEMENTS THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS MADE, NOT JUST TO WOMEN BUT TO\nOTHERS. BUT JUST TO THE POINT OF YOUR\nPREVIOUS SPEAKERS, ON POLICY, DONALD TRUMP COULD NOT TALK\nABOUT POLICY. HE DIDN'T SAY WHAT HE WOULD DO\nIN SYRIA OTHER THAN CONTINUE THIS SORT OF, YOU KNOW,\nFOOTSY-FOOTSY WITH PUTIN AND SUGGEST THAT PUTIN IN FACT DID\nNOT DIRECT THE HACKING OF U.S. AND OBVIOUSLY THE DNC AND\nOTHERS, WHICH HAS BEEN TOTALLY PROVEN TO BE WRONG.\nIN FACT, THE FACT CHECKERS HAVE SHOWN THAT THERE WERE AT LEAST\n30 CLEARLY WRONG STATEMENTS THAT DONALD TRUMP MADE.\nSO IT'S HARD FOR HER DURING A DEBATE TO FOCUS ON ANY\nPARTICULAR ONE BECAUSE SHE WOULD BE USING UP ALL OF HER TIME.\nBUT SHE'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT PEOPLE CARE\nABOUT. WHEN SHE RESPONDED TO ISSUES\nLIKE GOING TO SOMEBODY, LOOKING THEM IN THE EYE AND SAYING I\nUNDERSTAND, YOU WANT TO ELEVATE THIS CONVERSATION, YOU ARE A\nTEACHER, YOU WANT TO MAKE OUR CHILDREN PROUD OF WHAT WE ARE\nDOING, AND THEN WE ARE FACED WITH THIS GUY WHO IS DEMEANING\nTHE CONCEPT OF THE PRESIDENCY, MUCH LESS THE CONCEPT OF EVEN\nBEING A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT. SO SHE NOT JUST ON FORM, BUT ON\nPOLICY ITSELF, SHE'S GOING TO GO AFTER ALL OF THAT.\n>> SO JOHN, DO YOU THINK YOU ARE A TRUMP SUPPORTER, DO YOU THINK\nMR. TRUMP ARTICULATED WHAT HE WOULD DO IN SYRIA ABOUT ISIS AND\nABOUT BASHAR AL ASSAD AND ABOUT RUSSIAN AIR STRIKES THAT STRIKE\nTHINGS LIKE HOSPITALS AND CIVILIAN POPULATIONS?\nDO YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT HE ARTICULATED A PLAN THAT WOULD\nPREVENT THOSE TRAGEDIES FROM HAPPENING?\n>> YEAH. I THINK HE FEELS THE WAY A LOT\nOF US DO. HE'S HESITANT TO PUT TROOPS ON\nTHE GROUND. HE DOESN'T WANT TO GET US\nINVOLVED IN ANOTHER HOT WAR BUT HE UNDERSTANDS YOU HAVE A\nHUMANITARIAN CRISIS ON THE GROUND THERE --\n>> HE SAID HE WON'T LET SYRIA IMMIGRANTS INTO THE UNITED\nSTATES. >> THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY CAN'T\nGO SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE REGION WHICH IS PROBABLE BETTER FOR\nTHEM. >> HE PRAISED PUTIN AND ASSAD IN\nIRAN AND THEY ARE ENGAGED IN KILLING CIVILIANS.\nTRUMP, THAT WAS ALSO ONE OF THE POINTS THAT TRUMP WAS AT HIS\nLOWEST WAS DURING HIS FOREIGN POLICY.\nIT WAS A GIBBERISH MESS, COMPLETELY NOT COGENT AND HE\nCONTRADICTED HIS OWN VICE PRESIDENT WHICH IS\nUNPRECEDENTED. HE WAS VERY DEFENSIVE ABOUT IT,\nSAID I HAVEN'T TALKED TO HIM ABOUT THIS AND I DISAGREE.\nSO I THINK THAT THAT'S AGAIN, THAT DOESN'T REALLY GIVE ANY\nCOMFORT TO PEOPLE WHO ARE WATCHING THIS THAT HE HAS A FULL\nCOMMAND OF A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE.\nI MEAN, FOREIGN POLICY IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES OF\nTHE PRESIDENCY, EVEN MORE SO THAN DOMESTIC POLICY, REALLY,\nAND HE HAS NOT DEMONSTRATED THAT HE HAS A COMMAND OF THAT.\nSO I THINK THAT HE WAS GOOD ON OBAMACARE, GOOD ON THE TAXES\nISSUE AND HILLARY CLINTON WAS UNABLE TO CAPITALIZE ON TRYING\nTO TURN IT AROUND ON POLICY. SHE WANTS TO DO BETTER, SHE'S\nGOT TO COME UP WITH BETTER ANSWERS THAN SHE DID LAST NIGHT.\nTHAT WASN'T SUFFICIENT. SHE HAD A CHANCE TO KNOCK OUT --\nTO KNOCK TRUMP OUT AND SHE DIDN'T BECAUSE HE STILL LIVES TO\nFIGHT ANOTHER DAY OR EVEN PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO ADMIT IT HAVE\nTO ADMIT HE DID BETTER. >> I HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE.\n>> OH, YEAH. OKAY.\nTHANKS. >> I'M PROUD NONE OF YOU YELLED\nAT EACH OTHER. I FEEL LIKE WE SCORED A VICTORY\nTHIS MORNING. >> WE ARE TRYING TO ELEVATE\nTHINGS.",

THAT'S OKAY WITH HER.\n>> WAIT A SECOND. >> RELIGIOUS FREEDOM --\n>> WE'RE TALKING -- >> OH, YES, YES.\n>> I APPRECIATE YOU TALKING ABOUT SUBSTANCE, AND THAT IS\nIMPORTANT, BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LOCKER ROOM CONVERSATION.\nMY QUESTION WAS ABOUT, IS IT OKAY THAT A MAN WHO WANTS TO BE\nTHE PRESIDENT OF THE FREE WORLD IS BRAGGING, AND ADMITS TO IT,\nAND YES, HE'S APOLOGIZED, TO SEXUAL ASSAULT.\n>> BUT, YES, THAT IS -- THAT IS WRONG, ABSOLUTELY.\nBUT HERE'S THE THING, HE'S NOT RUNNING TO BE THE POPE.\nLOOK AT THE CULTURE OF OUR COUNTRY.\nEVERYBODY KNEW HE HAD STRIP CLUBS, BUT STILL THE MILLIONS OF\nPEOPLE CHOSE HIM TO BE THE NOMINEE.\nAND LOOK AT OUR CULTURE. IT'S FILLED WITH A BAR, STRIP\nCLUB ON EVERY CORNER. I'M A STRONG PRO-LIFE CHRISTIAN\nWOMAN. AND I WOULD NEVER TALK LIKE\nTHAT. I DON'T SMOKE.\nI DON'T DRINK. I DON'T DO DRUGS.\nI'VE BEEN MARRIED TO THE SAME MAN FOR 32 YEARS.\nI HAVE FOUR CHILDREN. WHOM I LOVE AND ADORE.\nAND IT'S REPULSIVE WHAT HAS BEEN SAID.\nTHIS WHOLE CAMPAIGN, THIS IS THE PERSON THAT NEEDS TO LEAD OUR\nCOUNTRY. GOD CAN USE ANYBODY.\nHE USED THE HARLETTS AND THAT'S OKAY.\nIT'S ALL ABOUT WHAT GOD CAN DO. GOD CAN DO THIS.\nGOD CAN USE THIS MAN. >> BUT YOU'RE SUGGESTING WE\nSHOULD TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES. WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THE\nSUBSTANCE. I WOULD ARGUE THAT SEXISM AND\nSEXUAL ASSAULT ARE A PART OF THE ISSUES THAT OUR COUNTRY MUST\nGRAPPLING. >> ABSOLUTELY.\nTHEY ARE. JUST LIKE HUMAN TRAFFICKING.\nJUST LIKE HUMAN TRAFFICKING. >> RIGHT.\nBUT THE THINGS -- >> IT'S ALL A PART OF IT.\n>> -- FROM THIS ADULT MAN WHO IS RUNNING TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE\nUNITED STATES, MILLIONS OF CHILDREN HEARD THAT, BOYS AND\nGIRLS. AND BOYS MAY TAKE THEIR CUES\nFROM THIS GUY WHO WANTS TO BE OUR PRESIDENT.\nAND BHAF BEHAVE IN ACCORDANCE -- >> WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS\nPRESIDENT, MY CHILDREN CAME HOME FROM SCHOOL AND THEY HAD NO IDEA\nIT WAS ACTUALLY CALLED THE OVAL OFFICE.\nTHEY THOUGHT IT WAS CALLED THE ORAL OFFICE BECAUSE OF THE TALK\nIN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. OKAY, BILL CLINTON EDUCATED MY\nCHILDREN AT A MUCH YOUNGER AGE THAN I WANTED TO.\n>> BUT BILL CLINTON ISN'T RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT RIGHT NOW.\n>> EXACTLY. >> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HILLARY\nCLINTON. >> BUT HIS WIFE IS.\nHIS WIFE IS. AND THEY ARE A PAIR.\nTHE TWO ARE ONE. >> NO, I DISAGREE.\n>> THEY ARE THE SAME. >> I DISAGREE.\n>> THEY'RE TOTALLY SAME. TOTALLY SAME.\n>> HOLDING HER ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE SEXIST THINGS THAT HER\nHUSBAND SAYS OR DOES IS THE VERY DEFINITION OF SEXISM ITSELF.\nHILLARY CLINTON HASN'T SEXUALLY ASSAULTED ANYONE.\nHILLARY CLINTON WAS NOT CAUGHT ON A TAPE SAYING THESE VULGAR\nTHINGS ABOUT MEN OR ABOUT OTHER WOMEN.\nI THINK THIS IS A DIVERSION TO TRY TO TAKE THE ATTENTION AWAY\nFROM TRUMP SAYING, WELL, BILL CLINTON DOES IT.\n>> THESE ARE CONVERSATIONS PEOPLE ARE HAVING.\nTHIS IS THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.\n>> THAT'S TRUE. >> I'M GRATEFUL TO HAVE YOU ON\nBECAUSE YOU REPRESENT A CHUNK OF THIS COUNTRY WHO ABSOLUTELY --\nWHO FEELS THIS WAY. I'VE GOT TO GO.\nI APPRECIATE THE DISCOURSE. WELCOME TO 2016.\nTHAT'S ALL I'M GOING TO SAY.",

TRUMP OR SOMEONE AT ONE OF HIS COMPANIES\nDISCRIMINATES AGAINST A FEMALE EMPLOYEE OR IGNORES A SEXUAL\nHARASSMENT COMPLAINT OR PARTICIPATES IN THE HARASSMENT\nTHEMSELVES.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO TURN IT\nAROUND, TO TURN THOSE STATES? >> COUPLE THINGS, ERIN.\nFIRST, I'LL PUSH BACK A BIT ON THE NBC POLL.\nTAKE A LOOK AT THE \"L.A. TIMES\" NATIONAL TRACKING POLL HAS MR.\nTRUMP IN FRONT BY SEVERAL POINTS.\nI'D SAY THERE'S SEVERAL OTHER STATES WRS WE HAVE GREAT\nOPPORTUNITY FOR PICKUPS. LOOK AT COLORADO, LOOK AT\nMICHIGAN. DAVID MENTIONED PENNSYLVANIA.\nTRUMP HAS A GREAT CHANCE, RECENT POLLS SHOW WE'RE IN REALLY GREAT\nSHAPE. AGAIN, THE WHOLE NBC POLL, THE\nFACT THAT IT HAPPENED BEFORE LAST NIGHT'S DEBATE, WHICH MR.\nTRUMP WON BIG LEAGUE, AS HE WOULD SAY, I THINK IS LITTLE BIT\nOFF BASE. >> OBVIOUSLY, OF COURSE, OUR\nSNAP POLL WHICH IS SCIENTIFIC SHOWED HE DID NOT WIN, OBVIOUSLY\nI KNOW YOU FELT HE DID. THAT'S, OF COURSE, YOUR RIGHT TO\nBELIEVE THAT. PAUL RYAN, THOUGH, HOUSE\nSPEAKER, NOT MAKING IT EASIER FOR YOU IN YOUR QUEST.\nYOUR QUEST TO FLIP STATES. HE'S COME OUT TODAY AND SAID I'M\nNOT GOING TO DEFEND DONALD TRUMP ANYMORE, GO AHEAD AND DO WHAT\nYOU NEED TO DO. HAS TRUMP SPOKEN DIRECTLY WITH\nPAUL RYAN ABOUT THIS, DID THEY HAVE A CONVERSATION?\n>> I'M NOT AWARE OF THEM TALKING TODAY.\nTHIS IS NOT GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE CAMPAIGN.\nMR. TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN IS POWERED BY THE PEOPLE, GRASSROOTS\nMOVEMENT. NEVER BEEN ABOUT THE D.C.\nINSIDERS. IN THE PRIMARY, MR. TRUMP FACED\n16 OPPONENTS, WENT THROUGH THEM, ONE WITH PRETTY BIG MARGINS.\nTHIS HAS NEVER BEEN ABOUT MARGIN.\nIT'S BEEN ABOUT THE PEOPLE, THESE GRASSROOTS EFFORTS ALL\nAROUND THE COUNTRY. >> SO IN TERMS OF YOUR PLAN,\nTHINGS YOU'RE GOING DO, SOURCE TELLING CNN TODAY, I KNOW YOU'VE\nPROBABLY HEARD THIS, BUT THE COMMISSION ON PRESIDENT HERBAL\nDE DEBATES THE CO-CHAIRMAN PUT THE\nKIBOSH ON TRUMP'S PLAN TO HAVE THE CLINTON ACCUSERS, WOMEN SIT\nIN THE FAMILY BOX, AT THE LAST MINUTE THEY SAID, NO, THEY CAN'T\nACTUALLY SIT THERE. THE QUESTION FOR YOU, ARE WE\nGOING TO SEE MORE OF THEM ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL?\n>> AS FAR AS WHAT WE'RE GOING SEE ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, NOT\nGOING TO SPEAK SO MUCH TO THAT AS WHAT WE MAY OR MAY NOT SEE.\nLAST NIGHT, US PUSHING BACK AGAINST THE HYPOCRISY FROM\nHILLARY CLINTON. WE'VE SEEN HILLARY CLINTON\nATTACK MR. TRUMP OVER AND OVER AND YESTERDAY WE PUT IT BACK TO\nHILLARY CLINTON AND SHOWED HERE IS HER LONG RECORD OF BEING\nDISRESPECTFUL AND BEING ABUSIVE TO WOMEN, AND HERE -- DOING\nTHINGS THAT PUT THEM IN VERY UNCOMFORTABLE SPOTS ESPECIALLY\nAS WE LOOK AT THE CASE, SAY, OF KATHY SHELTON WHO HILLARY\nCLINTON REPRESENTED THE -- >> AT THE 12 WAS A 12-YEAR-OLD.\n>> THAT WAS IN SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT CAME AFTER THAT.\nLOOK, WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PUSH BACK AND MAKE SURE\nWE'RE DEFENDING OURSELVES >> SO HILLARY CLINTON DID COME\nOUT AND SPEAK ABOUT THE ISSUE OF SEXUAL ASSAULT TODAY, ACTUALLY\nMOMENTS AGO AT HER RALLY IN CO\nCOLUMBUS, SHE SPOKE ABOUT IT. TALKED ABOUT DONALD TRUMP WHEN\nHE DISMISSED THE COMMENTS AS LOCKER ROOM BANTER ON THAT TAPE.\nHERE'S WHAT SHE SAID A MOMENT AGO.\n>> LAST NIGHT HE DOUBLED DOWN ON HIS EXCUSE SAYING, WELL, IT'S\nJUST LOCKER ROOM BANTER. YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED TODAY\nWHICH IS SO INTERESTING IS THAT A LOT OF ATHLETES AND COACHES\nFROM THE NBA, FROM MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL, FROM THE NFL AND MORE,\nHAVE BEEN COMING FORWARD, TWEETING, THEY'VE BEEN SAYING,\nNO, THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENS IN OUR LOCKER ROOMS.\n>> ARE THEY ALL WRONG, DONALD TRUMP IS RIGHT?\nIS IT STILL FAIR TO CALL THIS LOCKER ROOM BANTER?\n>> OF COURSE SECRETARY CLINTON DIDN'T -- HAD THIS AS PART OF\nHER ANSWER LAST NIGHT OR JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO.\n>> YEP. >> BUT MR. TRUMP VERY CLEARLY\nLAST NIGHT CAME OUT AND APOLOGIZED FOR HIS COMMENTS.\nHE APOLOGIZED TO HIS FAMILY. HE APOLOGIZED TO THE AMERICAN\nPEOPLE AND HE SAID HE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT\nREALLY ARE AFFECTING THIS COUNTRY.\nTHAT'S WHAT HE DID LAST NIGHT. I THINK IT'S A BIG PART OF THE\nREASON WHY HE WON. >> SO ONE THING AFTER LAST\nNIGHT, HE GAVE HIS AP POLOGYAPO WAS ASKED BY ANDERSON COOPER\nDIRECTLY THREE TIMES WHETHER HE SAID THE THINGS IN THE TAPE,\nWHETHER HE ACTUALLY DID THOSE THINGS.\nI WANT TO PLAY THAT FOR YOU. HERE HE IS.\n>> JUST FOR THE RECORD, THOUGH, ARE YOU SAYING THAT WHAT YOU\nSAID ON THAT BUS 11 YEARS AGO, YOU DID NOT ACTUALLY KISS WOMEN\nWITHOUT CONSENT OR GLOBE WOMEN WITHOUT CONSENT?\n>> I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR WOMEN.\nNOBODY HAS MORE RESPECT FOR WOMEN THAN I DO.\n>> SO FOR THE RECORD, YOU'RE SAYING YOU NEVER DID THAT?\n>> I SAID THINGS, FRANKLY, YOU HEAR THESE THINGS.\nTHEY'RE SAID. AND I WAS EMBARRASSED BY IT BUT\nI HAVE TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR WOMEN.\n>> HAVE YOU EVER DONE THOSE THINGS?\n>> WOMEN HAVE RESPECT FOR ME. I WILL TELL YOU -- NO, I HAVE\nNOT. >> WHY DID IT TAKE THREE TIMES\nFOR HIM TO SAY, NO, I HAVE NOT. IT WAS A PRETTY CLEAR QUESTION.\n>> I THINK MR. TRUMP ANSWERED IT VERY CLEARLY.\nTHESE ARE NOT THINGS THAT HE HAS DONE, BUT, AGAIN, LAST NIGHT,\nMR. TRUMP APOLOGIZED. WE'RE READY TO MOVE ON.\n>> I DO HAVE TO ASK YOU, THOUGH, ON THIS ISSUE, THERE ARE SEVERAL\nWOMEN AS YOU KNOW WHO HAVE STORIES THAT CONTRADICT WHAT\nTRUMP SAID. THEY OBVIOUSLY ALLEGE HE DID DO\nTHESE THINGS. FORMER MISS UTAH SAID TRUMP\nKISSED HER WITHOUT HER CONSENT, I HAVE REPORTED ON A FRIEND I\nKNOW WHO SAID THAT ALSO HAPPENED TO HER.\nARE YOU CONCERNED, IN ANY WAY, THAT TRUMP COULD BE MISLEADING\nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHEN HE SAYS NO, THAT THAT NEVER HAPPENED?\n>> NOT AT ALL. THESE ARE BASELESS CHARGES.\nMR. TRUMP HAS GREAT RESPECT FOR WOMEN.\nTAKE A LOOK AT HIS STRONG, POSITIVE RECORD OF EMPOWERING\nWOMEN. HIS COMPANY, AND ALL ASPECTS OF\nPROFESSIONAL LIFE, AND THESE ARE BASELESS ATTACKS.\n>> ALL RIGHT. THANK WITHDRYOU VERY MUCH, I\nAPPRECIATE YOUR TIME.",

NONE OF US ARE PERFECT.\n>> Reporter: DEFINITELY NOT PERFECT, BUT PRESIDENTIAL, THAT\nREMAINS TO BE SEEN. RANDI KAYE, CNN, AMBRIDGE,\nPENNSYLVANIA. >> MY FIRST QUESTION TO DONALD\nTRUMP LAST NIGHT WAS ABOUT THE TAPE RELEASED ON FRIDAY.\nREMEMBER, THIS WAS AFTER HE RELEASED A STATEMENT AND A VIDEO\nTO APOLOGIZE. IN BOTH APOLOGIES HE BRUSHED OFF\nHIS VULGAR REMARKS AS, QUOTE, LOCKER ROOM BANTER, HE WAS\nBRAGGING ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT, GRABBING WOMEN BY THEIR\nGENITALS, FORCIBLY KISSING THEM. LAST NIGHT HE DOUBLED DOWN ON\nTHAT STRATEGY SAYING, QUOTE, IT'S LOCKER ROOM TALK AND IT'S\nONE OF THOSE THINGS. TO SOME WOMEN, THOUGH, HIS WORDS\nAND TONE SOUNDED DISMISSIVE. JOINING ME, CNN POLITICAL\nCOMMENTATORS ANA NAVARRO, SCOTTIE NELL HUGHES.\nMANY TRUMP SUPPORTERS SEEM TO GIVE HIM A PASS ON THIS TAPE,\nMANY PEOPLE FOUND THIS TAPE SO OFFENSIVE BECAUSE IT WAS TRUMP\nDESCRIBING WHAT IS BY DEFINITION SEXUAL ASSAULT.\nI DID PRESS HIM ON THAT POINT AT LAST NIGHT'S DEBATE.\nI JUST WANT TO PLAY PART OF THAT.\nTHAT IS SEXUAL ASSAULT. YOU BRAG THAT YOU HAVE SEXUALLY\nASSAULTED WOMEN. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?\n>> NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT AT ALL. I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTOOD\nWHAT WAS SAID. THIS WAS LOCKER ROOM TALK.\nI'M NOT PROUD OF IT. I APOLOGIZED TO MY FAMILY.\nI APOLOGIZE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\nCERTAINLY I'M NOT PROUD OF IT, BUT THIS IS LOCKER ROOM TALK.\n>> I MEAN, BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OF SEXUAL\nASSAULT, WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT, THE BEHAVIOR WAS SEXUAL\nASSAULT. DO YOU THINK HIS ANSWER, THOUGH,\nPUT THIS ISSUE TO REST FOR HIM OR WON HIM ANY NEW SUPPORTERS,\nANA? >> I DON'T THINK IT WON HIM ANY\nNEW SUPPORTERS. I THINK IT DIDN'T LOSE HIM ANY\nOF HIS CORE SUPPORTERS, IN FACT, I WOULD TELL YOU THAT I THINK\nWHAT HE DID YESTERDAY, BRINGING OUT THOSE FOUR WOMEN, PARADING\nOUT THOSE FOUR WOMEN WITH A HISTORY WITH BILL CLINTON AND\nHILLARY CLINTON ACTUALLY ENERGIZED HIS BASE.\nTHEY'VE BEEN WANTING HIM TO HIT HARD EVEN IF IT MEANS HITTING\nBELOW THE BELT. I THINK IT REPELLED,\nANTAGONIZED, DISGUSTED, A LOT OF INDEPENDENTS, A LOT OF\nMODERATES, A LOT OF INDEPENDENT-LEANING REPUBLICANS\nWHO -- OR REPUBLICAN-LEANING INDEPENDENTS WHO JUST FOUND IT\nDISGUSTING AND GUTTER POLITICS. BUT LOOK, THIS ISSUE ABOUT HIS\nSUPPORTERS GIVING HIM A PASS ON THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT HIS\nSUPPORTERS HAVE DONE FROM DAY ONE.\nWHEN HE SAID, TALK ABOUT MEGYN KELLY'S MENSTRUAL CYCLE, NO, IT\nWASN'T ABOUT MENSTRUAL CYCLE. WHERE HE MOCKED A REPORTER WITH\nA DISABILITY. I GUESS I DON'T KNOW WHY.\nHE WAS SCRATCHING HIS NECK OR SOMETHING.\nWHEN HE CALLED A JUDGE INCAPABLE OF DOING HIS JOB BECAUSE HE WAS\nMEXICAN, DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE WASN'T MEXICAN, NO, THAT\nWASN'T RACISM. WHEN HE CALLED CARLY FIORINA\nUGLY AND SAID HER VOICE WAS IRRITATING, NO, THAT WASN'T\nSEXISM. THIS TYPE OF STEPFORD WIFE AND\nSTEPFORD HUSBAND BEHAVIOR AND REACTION FROM TRUMP SUPPORTERS\nGIVING HIM A PASS TELLING US WHAT WE HEARD WAS NOT ACCURATE,\nWHAT WE SAW WAS NOT ACCURATE HAS BEEN FROM DAY ONE.\nNOTHING HAS CHANGED. >> SCOTTIE, DO YOU THINK HE PUT\nTHIS ISSUE TO REST LAST NIGHT BY CONTINUING TO SAY IT WAS LOCKER\nROOM TALK AND APOLOGIZING? >> I THINK IT ACTUALLY DEVELOPED\nSINCE FRIDAY SINCE THE TAPES CAME OUT.\nHE DID APOLOGIZE FOR IT. THAT OBVIOUSLY WAS NOT\nACCEPTABLE TO PEOPLE, SOME LIKE ANA AND OTHERS.\nWHAT HAS DEVELOPED SINCE THEN HAS BEEN VERY INTERESTING.\nYOU'RE SEEING THE EXACT WORDS DONALD TRUMP SAID, THERE'S HATE\nIN HER HEART. WHAT I JUST HEARD, WITH ALL DUE\nRESPECT, ANA, YOU JUST INSULTED ALL OF THE FEMALE SUPPORTERS OF\nMR. TRUMP CALLING US ALL STEPFORD WIVES.\nTHAT SORT OF NAME CALLING IS NOT JUSTIFIED.\nTHIS IS THE PROBLEM WITH THE FEMINIST MOVEMENT TODAY.\n>> EXCEPT FOR DONALD TRUMP, SCOTTIE.\n>> LET HER ANSWER. >> IS THAT THEY FEEL LIKE\nTHEY'RE JUSTIFIED IN SPREADING HATE BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE THAT\nBECAUSE MR. TRUMP SAID SOMETHING 11 YEARS AGO THAT YOU ARE\nJUSTIFIED IN SPREADING HATE AND CALLING OTHER PEOPLE NAMES.\nI'M SORRY. MAYBE I'M HELD TO A HIGHER\nSTANDARD BECAUSE I HAVE LITTLE EYES THAT ARE WATCHING HOW I\nHANDLE THESE TYPES OF SITUATIONS.\nBUT THE LAST THREE DAYS I HAVE SEEN NOTHING BUT ABSOLUTE\nUNBRIDLED VILENESS AND DISRESPECT FROM ONE WOMAN TO\nANOTHER AND I THINK PAST THE ELECTION, PAST NOVEMBER, WE'RE\nGOING TO HAVE A REAL ISSUE BECAUSE NOW WOMEN ARE BEING --\nYOUNGER GENERATIONS OF WOMEN ARE BEING TAUGHT IT'S OKAY TO HATE\nOTHER WOMEN, THEY'RE JUSTIFIED IN THEIR HATE IF YOU DON'T AGREE\nWITH THEM. UNFORTUNATELY, I THINK THE\nFEMINIST MOVEMENT IS HAVING A MAJOR EFFECT RIGHT NOW.\n>> SCOTTIE, WHEN DONALD TRUMP SAID SHE HAS HATE IN HER HEART\nAND THE DEVIL, DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT?\n>> SHE LOOKED AT A MOM WHOSE SON WAS IN A CASKET, LIED TO HER,\nSAID THE REASON HER SON DIED WAS BECAUSE OF A VIDEO AND GO ON\nNATIONAL TELEVISION AND SAY THE MOTHER, HERSELF, DIDN'T HEAR HER\nRIGHT, THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH HER.\nWHEN I CAN LOOK AT A WOMAN WHO LAUGHED ABOUT A RAPIST SHE WAS\nABLE TO GET OFF OF A 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL, THERE'S SOMETHING VERY\nMUCH WRONG WITH HILLARY CLINTON. WHEN YOU'VE NEVER HEARD THE\nAPOLOGIES, IT'S NEVER BEEN A SINCERE APOLOGY TO THE PEOPLE\nSHE'S INSULTED. SHE SAID I'M SORRY I SAID IT,\nI'M NOT NECESSARILY SORRY FOR CALLING THESE PEOPLE THOSE\nNAMES. YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHAT SCARES ME\nABOUT HILLARY CLINTON RIGHT NOW. >> ANA --\n>> MR. TRUMP DOES APOLOGIZE. >> ANA, DO YOU SEE A DOUBLE\nSTANDARD IN TRUMP SUPPORTERS WHO WANT, YOU KNOW, SAY HILLARY\nCLINTON HASN'T GIVEN SINCERE APOLOGIES YET DONALD TRUMP FOR\nTHE FIRST TIME EVER APOLOGIZED JUST THIS WEEKEND?\n>> RIGHT. AFTER HAVING ADMITTED EARLIER IN\nTHE CAMPAIGN THAT HE HAD NEVER EXPRESSED REGRET, NEVER ASKED\nFOR FORGIVENESS NOT EVEN FROM GOD.\nWHAT I FIND, FRANKLY, HYPOCRITICAL AND FIND\nINCONSISTENT, I FIND ABSURD AND SURREAL IS FOR SCOTTIE OR ANY OF\nHIS SUPPORTERS TO TELL ME I'M SPREADING HATE, TO TELL ME THAT\nI'M NAME CALLING. THIS MAN HAS BEEN DOING NOTHING\nBUT NAME CALLING AND SPREADING HATE FROM THE FIRST MOMENT HE\nANNOUNCED JUNE 16th, 2015. HE CALLED MEXICAN RAPISTS.\nHE HAS CALLED ROSIE O'DONNELL A FAT PIG.\nHE HAS CALLED CARLY FIORINA UGLY.\nI MEAN, WHAT DO YOU CALL THAT? >> ALL RIGHT.\n>> HE HAS CALLED MISS UNIVERSE --\n>> HERE'S THE DIFFERENCE. >> -- DISGUSTING AND SAID -- THE\nDIFFERENCE IS I'M JUST A TV -- >> ANA --\n>> HE'S TRYING TO RUN FOR THE HIGHEST OFFICE OF THE LAND.\nREPRESENTING ALL AMERICANS. >> I WANT YOU BOTH TO HOLD THIS.\nYOU GOT TO HOLD THIS THOUGHT. >> I GET STOPPED AT AIRPORTS BY\nVICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT WHO SAY TO ME, THANK YOU FOR\nSPEAKING UP, THANK YOU FOR UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT IS\nSEXUAL ASSAULT. THAT AN UNWANTED SEXUAL ASSAULT,\nA MAN WHO THINKS HE IS ENTITLED AND POWERFUL, BEING ABLE TO\nGROPE A WOMAN WHO DOES NOT WANT IT, IS SEXUAL ASSAULT.\nSO IT MAY NOT MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU.\nIT MEANS A LOT TO ME. >> SCOTTIE, YOU'LL BE ABLE TO\nRESPOND IN A SECOND. WE GOT TO TAKE A BREAK.\nWE'LL HAVE MORE ON THIS DISCUSSION.\nWE'LL ALSO TAKE A LOOK AT THE BODY LANGUAGE EXPERT BREAKING\nDOWN LAST NIGHT'S DEBATE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.",

THIS IS CLEARLY THE TALKING\nPOINT FOR TRUMP AND HIS SURROGATES, IT'S LOCKER ROOM\nTALK. I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT, THEY\nWERE NOT IN A LOCKER ROOM. IN FACT, THEY WERE IN A\nWORKPLACE, A TELEVISION SET WHERE THERE WAS A BUNCH OF\nPEOPLE AROUND, THEY MAY HAVE ALL BEEN GUYS BUT I'VE REPRESENTED A\nLOT OF MEN IN SEXUAL HARASSMENT CASES AND I CAN TELL YOU A LOT\nOF MEN FIND THIS OFFENSIVE AS WELL.\nTHEY ARE TALKING ABOUT A WOMEN, THE ACTRESS WHEN THEY GET OUT OF\nTHE BUS AND SHE'S THERE GETTING PAID TO SMILE AND BE NICE.\nSHE THEN HAS TO HUG DONALD TRUMP AFTER HE'S JUST TALKED ABOUT\nWHAT HE LIKES TO DO TO WOMEN, STICK HIS TONGUE DOWN THEIR\nTHROAT, GROPE THEIR GENITALS. THIS IS A WORKPLACE.\nIT'S NOT A LOCKER ROOM. >> THAT'S A GOOD POINT.\nTHIS IS A PROFESSIONAL WORKPLACE AND THERE ARE LOTS OF LAWS\nGUIDING HOW ONE ACTS IN THOSE ENVIRONMENTS.\nLISA BLOOM, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.",

THESE -- THESE SORT OF STUNTS,\nJUST -- THEY'RE ALMOST DESIGNED TO DRIVE AWAY VOTERS AMONG WHOM\nMITT ROMNEY HAD A HUGE ADVANTAGE.\n>> AND TRUMP CLEARLY CAME IN KNOWING IT'S A BIG ISSUE AND\nDECIDED TO PLAY THE BILL CLINTON CARD AS THE DIVERSION.\nLISTEN AS ANDERSON COOPER TRIES TO GET HIM TO ANSWER.\nDONALD TRUMP WHAT HE TALKED ABOUT IN THE TAPE IS A CRIME.\nGRABBING IN PRIVATE PARTS. HOW HE EXPLAINED IT LAST NIGHT.\n>> ARE YOU SAYING THAT WHAT YOU SAID ON THAT BUS 11 YEARS AGO,\nYOU DID NOT ACTUALLY KISS WOMEN WITHOUT CONSENT OR GROPE WOMEN\nWITHOUT CONSENT? >> I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR\nWOMEN. NOBODY HAS MORE RESPECT FOR\nWOMEN THAN I DO. >> FOR THE RECORD YOU'RE SAYING\nYOU NEVER DID THAT. >> I SAID THINGS -- FRANKLY, YOU\nHEAR THESE THINGS THAT WERE SAID AND I WAS EMBARRASSED BY IT, BUT\nI HAVE TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR WOMEN.\n>> HAVE YOU EVER DONE THOSE THINGS?\n>> AND WOMEN HAVE RESPECT FOR ME, AND I WILL TELL YOU, NO, I\nHAVE NOT. >> KUDOS TO MY COLLEAGUE THERE,\nKEPT PRESSING TO GETS ANSWER. TRUMP COMPLAINING ABOUT THE\nMODERATORS, ONE OF THE REASONS THEY KEPT COMING BACK AT HIM, HE\nWASN'T ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS. EVEN SOME ON HIS OWN TEAM WANTED\nTRUMP AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY, WAH WANT TO BRING UP BILL\nCLINTON LATER, BRING HIM UP LATER.\nTAKE ONE, CLEAN CONTAINED OPPORTUNITY TO SAY I'M SORE.  I'M SORRY.\nI LISTENED TO IT, I GET IT, I REGRET THOSE THINGS AND HE\nSIMPLY DIDN'T DO THAT. >> LOCKER ROOMS, PLEASE, DON'T\nLOWER THE BAR. >> ANYONE CLOSE THAT GET SLAMMED\nA LOCKER, ESSENTIALLY. >> MADE A LOT OF SENSE FOR HIM\nTO HAVE A HEARTFELT APOLOGY AND NOT PIVOT IMMEDIATELY TO ISIS\nAND WHITE HOUSE ANY TRANSITION WHATSOEVER, AND I WILL NOTE THAT\nBOTH OF THEM ARE PARTICULARLY BAD AT CONTRITION.\nI'VE ACTUALLY THOUGHT WITH CLINTON, IF SHE LOOKED OR\nSOUNDED LIKE SHE WAS SORRY ABOUT THE E-MAIL THING INSTEAD OF JUST\nSAYING, I -- AM VERY SORRY ABOUT THAT MISTAKE.\nIT WOULD ACTUALLY HELP NEUTRALIZE THE ISSUE AND FOR\nHIM, TOO. THEY'RE BOTH VERY BAD AT IT.\n>> HE WAS GETTING CONFLICTING POLITICAL ADVICE HOW TO WIN THE\nELECTION BEFORE THE TAPE CAME OUT.\nALWAYS A FACTION IN THE TRUMP WORLD.\nROGER STONE, STEVE BANNON, ROGER STONE, OUTSIDE ADVISER NOT\nREALLY WITH THE CAMPAIGN BUT ALWAYS PUSHING TRUMP AFTER HILL\nDIVE DEEP ON TO BILL'S INDISCRETIONS, AND FRANKLY A LOT\nOF HIS ADVISERS RECENTLY WERE SAYING NO, NO, NO.\nDON'T GO THERE. REMEMBER, AFTER THE FIRST DEBATE\nTALKING HOW RESTRAINED TRUMP WAS IN NOT GOING THERE.\nTHAT FACTION WON, WHY? ONLY WAY TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST\nYOUR OWN LOCKER ROOM BANTER GO FULL-ON INTO CLINTON'S SEX LIFE.\n>> ROGER WANTED TO DO THAT IN THE FIRST DEBATE AND LOST.\nAT THAT POINT TRUMP HAD MOMENTUM INTO THIS ONE, TRUMP LOST\nMOMENTUM, CLINTON HAD IT AND THEN THIS TAPE CAME OUT.\nWOLF BLITZER INTERVIEWED DONALD TRUMP SOME TIME AGO.\nPROSECUTED A CASE MANY PROSECUTORS WANTED PROSECUTED A\nLONG TIME. ONE PERSON WHO DID NOT, DONALD\nJOHN TRUMP N. YOUR BOOK, MRS. CLINTON A WONDERFUL WOMAN WHO'S\nHANDLED PRESSURE INCREDIBLY WELL.\n>> I AGROW WITHAGREE WITH THAT. GONE THROUGH TERRIBLE TIMES.\nMORE THAN ANY WOMAN AND SHE'S ON THE FRONT PAGE OF EVERY\nNEWSPAPER IN WASHINGTON, I THINK A WONDERFUL WOMAN.\n>> IS SHE QUALIFIED TO BE SENATOR?\n>> I THINK SHE IS. FRANKLY, IF SHE RAN FROM ANOTHER\nSTATE I THINK I'D SUPPORT HER, BECAUSE SHE'S REALLY A VERY\nTERRIFIC WOMAN. I KNOW HER.\n>> NOW, THAT'S A -- YOU CAN DISAGREE WITH THE ANSWER, A\nTHOUGHTFUL, COHERENT THOUGHT FROM DONALD TRUMP ON HIS VIEW OF\nALL THIS TALKING ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON, A TERRIFIC WOMAN.\nTHIS IS NOT FAIR TO HER. THAT WAS ONE WAY TO PUT IT.\nHERE'S HOW HE SAID IT ON NEIL CAVUTO ON FOX NEWS TALKING ABOUT\nBILL CLINTON AND THESE WOMEN COMING UP.\nHE SAID, I'M NOT SURE WOMEN HE DID IT WITH MAKE HIM ALLURING.\nGIVE ME A BREAK, THE WHOLE GROUP, PAULA JONES, LEWINSKY?\nJUST A REALLY UNATTRACTIVE GROUP.\nI'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT PHYSICAL, BUT -- THEN NEIL\nINTERVIEWED, WOULD IT MAKE ANY DIFFERENT?\nBE ANY DIFFERENT IF 2 WERE A SUPERMODEL CROWD?\n>> AT LEAST MORE PLEASANT TO WATCH, WAS DONALD TRUMP'S\nANSWER. >> ISN'T THIS -- THIS IS THE WAY\nDONALD TRUMP CHANGED WHAT WE SEE AS NORMAL IN THIS ELECTION.\nWE'RE TALKING ABOUT HIM RATING WOMEN AND BANNING MUSLIM\nIMMIGRATION AND -- I MEAN I CAN SPEND THE REST OF THE HOUR GOING\nON WITH THE -- >> SAYING IT'S OKAY FOR A RADIO\nTALK SHOW HOST TO REFER TO HIS DAUGHTER AS A PIECE OF --\n>> ANY OF THESE THINGS SAID BY ANY OTHER CANDIDATE, BY JEB\nBUSH, MARCO RUBIO, TED CRUZ, THEY WOULD BE GONE AND DONE AND\nNOW WE'RE SORT OF DEBATING WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS THE FINAL\nSTRAW, I MEAN, THIS IS -- I THINK THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING\nMOMENT IN WHICH THINGS THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN NORMALIZED BEFORE ARE\nSUDDENLY NORMALIZED. WE HAVEN'T EVEN GOTTEN TO THE\nPART HE PUBLICLY DISAGREED WITH HIS VICE PRESIDENT'S STATED\n30 POLICY.\n>> CAN I BRIEFLY SAY, CLINTON'S ACTUAL, BILL CLINTON ACTUAL\nBEHAVIOR NOT HIDDEN, OVERLOOKED. THAT NORMALIZED IS NOT OKAY\nEITHER. >> EXCEPT IT WAS THE SUBJECT OF\nKEN STARR'S REPORT. 2\nALL OF THESE STORIES CAME INTO AND WERE INVESTIGATED BY STARR.\nIT WAS SOMETHING THAT THE COUNTRY DID SPEND A YEAR\nLITIGATING, AND ONE REASON THAT A LOT OF REPUBLICANS DON'T WANT\nTO GO AFTER THIS IS THAT THE VERY WEEK THAT BILL CLINTON WAS\nIMPEACHED, HIS JOB APPROVAL RATING IN THE GALLUP POLL ENT UP\nTO 73%. >> I AGREE.\n>> LAWYERS SAY, ASKED AND ANSWERED.\n>> REPUBLICANS LOST FIVE SEATS THAT YEAR IN THE HOUSE.\n>> RIGHT. 1998 MID-TERM ELECTIONS\nHISTORICAL ANOOMLY, THE PARTY IN THE WHITE HOUSE ACTUALLY LOST\nSEATS BECAUSE OF THE INVESTIGATION.\n>> CLEARLY A FACTION IN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN THINKS THEY CAN\nTRY AGAIN. MOST REPUBLICANS THINK IT'S A\nBAD IDEA.",

CAROL LEE, AND CNN POLITICS\nEDITOR WANNA SOMMERS WITH US AS WELL.\nTHE SPEAKER WILL SPEND ALL HIS TIME TRYING TO MAINTAIN THE\nREPUBLICAN MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE OF PRESENTATIVES, MEANING IN\nEFFECT NOT SPENDING ANY TIME TRYING TO GET DONALD TRUMP\nELECTED? >> I DON'T SEE TODAY AS THAT BIG\nA DEVELOPMENT, BECAUSE TO ME IT'S A DISTINCTION WITHOUT A\nDIFFERENCE, IN ESSENCE. HE ESSENTIAL HE SPENT THE LAST\nSIX MONTHS SINCE THE SPRING ONLY FOCUSED ON KEEPING THE\nREPUBLICAN MAJORITY. RAISING MONEY NOR HOUSE AND\nSENATE CANDIDATES AND OTHERS AND HASN'T REALLY SAID OR DONE MUCH\nPUBLICLY FOR DONALD TRUMP BESIDES APPEARING AT THE\nCONVENTION AND ANSWERING QUESTION WHEN ASKED BY CNN, AND\nOTHERS. HE SAID TODAY HE CAN'T -- THE\nREPUBLICANS CAN'T GIVE HILLARY CLINTON A BLANK CHECK.\nUSING THOSE WORDS IN FUND-RAISING E-MAILS FOR MONTH.\nTO ME, NOT AS BIG A DEAL. >> SUPPOSED TO REMEMBER, THIS\nPAST SATURDAY, WAS GOING TO WELCOME DONALD TRUMP TO\nWISCONSIN TOGETHER WITH THE GOVERNOR AND A SENATOR.\nHAVE A BIG DEAL THERE, BUT AFTER THE TAPE BY THE \"WASHINGTON\nPOST,\" THE \"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD\" TAPE CAME OUT, HE CANCELLED.\nDISINVITED HIM FROM COMING TO WISCONSIN.\n>> AND THAT THERE IS THE BIG DEAL.\nSO NOW, YOU KNOW, ALL THINGS EQUAL, THEY HAVE NOT CAMPAIGNED\nTOGETHER. THEY WILL NOT CAMPAIGN TOGETHER\nAND HE WILL NOT WITHDRAW HIS ENDORSEMENT BECAUSE HE TAKES\nSERIOUSLY HIS ROLE AS ESSENTIALLY THE SENIOR\nREPUBLICAN IN THE LAND, AND THAT AS IF THE PARTY OVERALL IS DOING\nTHAT AND NO PLANS AT THIS HOUR TO DO THAT.\n>> WHAT IS THE MESSAGE, CAROL, PAUL RYAN IS SENDING TO\nREPUBLICANS? >> HARD TO READ THAT ANY OTHER\nWAY THAN THEY THIS DONALD TRUMP HAS LOST THE RACE AND NEEDS TO\nTAKE CARE OF WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT TO HIM.\nMAINTAINING REPUBLICAN CONTROL OF THES HOUSE.\nI ALSO THINK YOU CAN'T UNDERESTIMATE THE REPUBLICANS\nARE WORRIED THAT MORE WILL COME OUT LIKE THIS.\nTHE FACT HE'S SAYING HE IS NOT GOING TO DEFEND DONALD TRUMP\nANYMORE IS SIGNIFICANT. WHAT HAPPENED OVER THE WEEKEND,\nTHERE IS CONCERN THAT WHAT ELSE IS OUT THERE?\nWHAT'S IT GOING TO BE NEXT WEEK? GOING TO BE THE WEEK AFTER THAT?\nAND SO I THINK YOU'RE JUST SEEING HIM DOING WHAT HE HAS\nBEEN DOING, BUT ACTUALLY SAYING IT VERY EXPLICITLY.\n>> THE WORKING ASSUMPTION IS, AND THEY'RE AID FRFRAID OF THISE\nVIDEO AND AUDIOTAPES TO COME OUT THAT WILL EMBARRASS THEM.\n>> ABSOLUTELY. THE BIG CONCERN.\nA LOT OF REPUBLICANS ARE FEARFUL OF THAT ESPECIALLY IN R50EECENT\nPOLLING. IF WE'D HAD THE CONVERSATION\nTHREE, FOUR MONTHS AGO, TALKING AK REPUBLICANS LOSING SEATS ONE\nTHOUGHT SAFE IN THE HOUSE WOULD BE YOUD LANDISH.\nNOW A NEW NORMAL YOU HAVE A NOMINEE WITH THESE KIND OF CRUDE\nCOMMENTS ABOUT WOMEN THAT ARE OUT THERE, AND I THINK THAT IF\nYOU'RE TO HEAR MORE OF THAT, YOU'RE LIKELY TO SEE THE POLLS\nGET WORSE AND WORSE. WE'RE IN A CRITICAL PERIOD\nBEFORE THE EASE LESHGS, NO ROOM FOR ERROR FOR THE REPUBLICANS.\n>> AND A NEW \"WASHINGTON JOURNAL\" AND NEWS POLL, 11-POINT\nADVANTAGE FOR HILLARY CLINTON OVER DONALD TRUMP.\nHILLARY CLINTON, 45%. 35% FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nPRETTY LOW. THAT'S GOING TO SEND A POWERFUL\n34E6G TO REPUBLICANS AS WELL? >> IT IS.\nI THINK THAT'S PART OF WHY YOU SAW RYAN DO WHAT HE DID TODAY.\nHE SENSED IT WAS COMING. PRETTY EVIDENT OVERNIGHT FRIDAY\nINTO SATURDAY AND INTO SUNDAY THIS WAS RAEZ RESONATING AND\nWOULD CAUSE TROUBLE AMENG WOMEN VOTERS.\nDO WHAT YOU DO IN YOUR OWN DISTRICT, HE SAID THAT TODAY, IS\nIMPORTANT. ABOUT 20 RACES REPUBLICANS ARE\nON THE BUBBLE. UNDER THREAT.\nMORE SO TODAY THAN FRIDAY MORNING.\nSO YOU WILL PROBABLY SEE THOSE ONES PRETTY QUICKLY COME UP WITH\nSOME KIND OF ANSWER THAT EITHER SAID I'M NOT VOTING FOR HIM.\nHE SHOULD APOLOGIZE AGAIN OR SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES.\nTHERE ARE MORE HARD RIGHT CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS IN THIS\nCAUCUS SAYING THEY'RE UPSETS WITH THIS DECISION.\nTHAT MAKES SENSE. THEIR DISTRICTS ARE DEEP RED,\nAND THAT'S WHERE DONALD TRUMP ENJOYS BIG SUPPORT.\nWILL CAUSE GREATER FISSURES WITHIN THE CAUCUS.\n>> AND SEEM TO BE ONBOARD AFTER THE DEBATE PERFORMANCE.\nREINCE PRIEBUS GOING OUT SPEAKING ENTHUSIASTICALLY ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP, EVEN THOUGH HE CONDEMNED IN HARSH TERMS THAT\nVIDEOTAPE. >> THEY SEEM TO BE ONBARD SO\nFAR. HEARING THAT PUBLICLY.\nQUESTIONS SWIRLING AROUND YESTERDAY WHETHER OR NOT THEY\nWOULD REMOVE RESOURCES AWAY FROM THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.\nINSTEAD FUNNEL THOSE INTO DOWN BALLOT RACES EFFECTIVELY AND\nJOINT FUND-RAISING AGREEMENT THE PARTY HAS WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL\nNOMINEE. EXPECTING TO HEAR MORE OUT OF\nTHE RNC. A CALL SCHEDULED LATER THIS\nEVENING. MORE ANSWERS WHAT THEY PLAN TO\nDA AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY PLAN TO CONTINUE TO BACK THEIR\nNOMINEE. >> HOW SUCCESSFUL, CAROL, WAS\nDONALD TRUMP LAST NIGHT, IN THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE IN\nADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF THAT AWFUL 2005 VIDEOTAPE?\n>> WELL, THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION, BECAUSE THIS POLL INDICATES,\nFIRST EARLY SIGN THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY REALLY --\n>> THIS POLL TAKEN BEFORE THE DEBATE LAST NIGHT.\nRIGHT. >> BUT IT WAS -- BEFORE THE\nDEBATE, DEFINITELY TAKEN AT LEAST AFTER THE FRIDAY NIGHT\nRELEASE? >> AND THEN YOU SAW DONALD TRUMP\nDO LAST NIGHT WAS DOUBLE DOWN ON THIS LOCKER ROOM TALK LINE, AND\nI DON'T THINK THAT THAT -- THAT DIDN'T MAKE A LOT OF HIS PEOPLE\nWHO WANT HIM TO APOLOGIZE MORE FULL-THROATEDLY HAPPY AND NOT\nCLEAR THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO PLAY WITH WOMEN.\n>> LET ME PLAY THAT EXCHANGE WITH ANDERSON COOPER.\nLISTEN TO THIS. >> ARE YOU SAYING WHAT YOU SAID\nON THAT BUS 11 YEARS AGO, THAT YOU DID NOT ACTUALLY KISS WOMEN\nWITHOUT CONSENT OR GROPE WOMEN WITHOUT CONSENT?\n>> I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR WOMEN.\nNOBODY HAS MORE RESPECT FOR WOMEN THAN I DO SO YOU'RE SAYING\nYOU -- >> YOU HEAR THE THINGS I SAID.\nI WAS EMBARRASSED BY IT, BUT I HAVE TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR\nWOMEN. >> HAVE YOU EVER DONE THOSE\nTHINGS? >> AND I WILL TELL YOU, NO, I\nHAVE NOT. >> WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THAT\nEXCHANGE? >> I THOUGHT THAT, KNOW, HE SAID\nHE HAD NEVER DONE THAT. WELL, YOU KNOW, NOW EVERYONE\nWILL BE DIGGING INTO WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S ACTUALLY TRUE.\nSO THERE'S THAT QUESTION. AND -- BUT SAYING THAT THIS IS\nLOCKER ROOM TALK IS NOT -- AGAIN, IT GOES BACK TO HIS\nINITIAL WAY OF APOLOGIZING WHICH WAS A HALF APOLOGY, AND THEN DID\nSOMETHING A LITTLE MORE MEANINGFUL, AND NOW BACK TO\nDOING THIS LOCKER ROOM TALK, WHICH TELLS ME AND EVERYBODY\nELSE THAT THAT'S REALLY HOW HE THINKS ABOUT THIS.\n>> WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION WHEN YOU HEARD\n>> TO ME SOUNDED LIKE HE WAS DIVERTING ATTENTION AWAY FROM\nHIMSELF. SAID IT'S LOCKER ROOM.\nBROUGHT UP INDISCRETIONS OF PAST PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON.\nSOUNDED LIKE A CHILD WOULD SAY. DID A BAD THING.\nSORRY ABOUT THAT, BUT LOOK WHAT THIS PERSON DID OVER HERE?\nTHAT THING IS REALLY BAD, TOO. CAME ACROSS -- FOR A CANDIDATE\nWHO DID ONE OF THE RECENT QUINNIPIAC POLLS, 25% WITH\nWOMEN. I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING AWAY.\n>> QUICKLY AFTER HIS APOLOGY WENT ON THE OFFENSIVE AGAINST\nBILL CLINTON. >> RIGHT.\n>> WHAT HE DID MANY YEARS AGO. WATCH THIS.\n>> IF YOU LOOK AT BILL CLINTON, FAR WORSE.\nMINE ARE WORDS AND HIS WAS ACTION.\nHIS WAS WHAT HE'S DONE TO WOMEN, THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYBODY IN\nTHE HISTORY OF POLITICS IN THIS NATION THAT'S BEEN SO ABUSIVE TO\nWOMEN. SO -- YOU CAN SAY ANY WAY YOU\nWANT TO SAY IT, BUT BILL CLINTON WAS ABUSIVE TO WOMEN.\nHILLARY CLINTON ATTACKED THOSE SAME WOMEN.\n>> AND AS YOU KNOW, THE \"WASHINGTON POST\" REPORTED\nINITIALLY THAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WANTED SOME OF THOSE\nWOMEN WHO MADE THOSE ACCUSATIONS AGAINST BILL CLINTON TO NOT ONLY\nSIT UP FRONT BLUT WHAT WAS DESCRIBED AS THE FAMILY BOX LAST\nNIGHT. THE ORGANIZATION FOR THE\nPRESIDENTIAL DEBATE SAID, NOT HAPPENING.\n>> RIGHT. AND THWARTED REALLY AT THE 11th\nHOUR. AT THE VERGE OF DOING IT AND\nDEBATE EXPERTS STEPPED IN. AN INTERESTING ARGUMENT AND\nTHERE'S BEEN PLENTY OF POLLING DONE TO SUGGEST THAT THAT WILL\nNOT RESONATE WELL OVERALL. SERM WILL RESONATE AND PROBABLY\nSTOPS THE BLEEDING FOR HIM AMONG MOST ARDENT SUPPORTERS AND\nDIEHARD REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE WAITED 24 YEARS TO SEE A\nREPUBLICAN GO TOE-TO-TOW, FACE-TO-FACE WITH A CLINTON AND\nBRING UP THIS STUFF. THE REST OF THE COUNTRY, LOOK AT\nPOLLING, DOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT, DOESN'T CARE AND KNOWS\nTHE DISTINCTION BETWEEN BILL CLINTON AND HILLARY CLINTON.\n>> A LOT MORE TO ASSESS.",

IT SHOWS HILLARY CLINTON UP 11\nPOINTS NATIONALLY OVER TRUMP. SO LET ME BRING IN MY PANEL.\nLOTS TO TALK ABOUT ON THIS MONDAY, 29 DAYS TO GO.\nJULIE PACE IS BACK WITH US TODAY, CNN CONTRIBUTOR AND CHIEF\nWHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT FOR THE ASSOCIATED PRESS AND ARI\nFLEISCHER IS WITH US. WELCOME, WELCOME, TO ALL OF YOU.\nARI, YOU'RE FIRST AT BAT. QUESTION BEING, YOU HEARD ABOUT\nPAUL RYAN. DO YOU AGREE WITH WHAT HE'S\nDOING FOR THE NEXT 29 DAYS? >> I DO AGREE.\nHE DOESN'T WANT TO GET DRAGGED INTO EVERYTHING DONALD TRUMP.\nHE HAS HIS OWN CONSTITUENCY TO WORRY ABOUT.\nIT'S SMART OF HIM TO SAY, HE STILLDORSEMENT, BUT HE'S\nSENDING A SIGNAL TO THE PRESS, DON'T ASK ME TO WORRY ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP ANYMORE BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU AN ANSWER.\n>> CAN YOU READ INTO IT ANY MORE?\nDO YOU THINK THIS SHOWS FEAR, HIS REAL WORRY IS HOLDING ONTO\nTHAT REPUBLICAN MAJORITY? >> WELL, THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN A\nWORRY. I THINK THE HOUSE IS SAFE, NO\nMATTER WHAT TRUMP LOSES BY. IN ANY WAY SHAPE THE FORM, I\nDON'T THINK THE HOUSE WILL BE IN DANGER.\nWHAT RYAN IS DOING IS SENDING A SIGNAL TO COLLEGE GRADUATES,\nTHOSE WHO PAY A LITTLE MORE ATTENTION TO THE ENDORSEMENTS.\nTHIS IS WHERE DONALD TRUMP IS THE WEAKEST, WHERE CONGRESSIONAL\nDEFECTIONS DON'T REALLY MATTER. THEY COULD HURT DONALD TRUMP\nWITH A GROUP HE HAS TO GET BACK INTO HIS COLUMN IF HE HAS ANY\nCHANCE OF WINNING AND THAT'S COLLEGE-EDUCATED REPUBLICAN\nVOTERS. >> I ALSO NOTED YOU SAID, NO\nMATTER WHAT TRUMP LOSES BY. JULIA, I WANT YOU IN ON THIS.\nYOU ALSO HEARD MANU TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE PUSHBACK THAT\nSPEAKER RYAN IS GETTING, ESPECIALLY IN THE MORE\nCONSERVATIVE DISTRICTS, THEY'RE ANGRY, THEY'RE SAYING HE'S\nESSENTIALLY CONCEDING THE ELECTION TO HILLARY CLINTON,\nTHAT HE'S ESSENTIALLY GIVING UP, THEN, ON THE SUPREME COURT.\nARE YOU SURPRISED BY THE BACKLASH?\n>> I'M NOT SURPRISED BY THE BACKLASH.\nIF YOU LOOK AT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY RIGHT NOW AND YOU LOOK AT\nTHE MAKEUP OF THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS AND YOU ALSO LOOK AT\nTHOSE POLL NUMBERS YOU JUST SHOWED THERE, YOU HAVE ANYWHERE\nBETWEEN A THIRD TO A HALF OF THE REPUBLICANS RIGHT NOW THAT ARE\nLOYAL TO DONALD TRUMP. THEY BELIEVE IN WHAT HE'S\nTALKING ABOUT WHEN IT COMES TO IMMIGRATION AND VARIOUS OTHER\nPOLICIES. AND THEY ALSO JUST VIGOROUSLY\nHATE HILLARY CLINTON AND WOULD DO ANYTHING TO SEE HER KEPT FROM\nTHE WHITE HOUSE. IT ALMOST DOESN'T MATTER WHAT\nDONALD TRUMP DOES TO THEM AS LONG AS IT ENDS UP WITH HILLARY\nNOT BEING THE PRESIDENT. SO I'M NOT SURPRISED BY THIS\nPUSHBACK. IT JUST REINFORCES THAT NO\nMATTER WHAT HAPPENS, WHETHER TRUMP WINS OR LOSES, THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY HAS A HUGE PROBLEM ON THEIR HANDS.\n>> LAST NIGHT, THE MOMENT IN THE DEBATE, CALLED NIXONIAN,\nCOMPARED TO A DICTATOR. THIS WAS UNPRESSCEDENTED MOMENT.\nROLL IT. >> IF I WIN, I'M GOING TO GET\nON -- TO GET A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR BECAUSE THERE'S NEVER\nBEEN SO MANY LIES, SO MUCH DECEPTION.\n>> IT'S AWFULLY GOOD THAT SOMEONE WITH THE TEMPERAMENT OF\nDONALD TRUMP IS NOT IN CHARGE OF THE LAW IN OUR COUNTRY.\n>> BECAUSE YOU'D BE IN JAIL. >> SECRETARY CLINTON --\n[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] >> JUST TO FOLLOW ON FROM THAT,\nLET ME SHOW YOU THIS FROM A.G. ERIC HOLDER, IN THE U.S. WE DO\nNOT THREATEN TO JAIL POLITICAL OPPONENTS.\nDONALD TRUMP SAID HE WOULD. HE IS PROMISING TO ABUSE THE\nPOWER OF THE OFFICE. ARI, YOU SAY, YOU KNOW, TRUMP IS\nFLAT WRONG ON THIS. DO YOU EVEN THINK HE UNDERSTANDS\nHOW THE JUSTICE SYSTEM WORKS? >> I DON'T KNOW IF HE DOESN'T,\nBUT I KNOW WHAT HE SAID IS WRONG.\nTHE UNITED STATES PRESIDENT DOES NOT DIRECT THE IRS TO AUDIT\nANYBODY OR TARGET ANYBODY, INDIVIDUALS.\nTHE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT DIRECT THE\nATTORNEY GENERAL TO TARGET INDIVIDUALS, TO PROSECUTE\nINDIVIDUALS. WE HAVE A SEPARATE SYSTEM OF\nJUSTICE THAT HAS TO MAKE THOSE CALLS.\nLOOK, I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT JIM COMEY AT THE FBI DID\nWHEN THEY REVIEWED HILLARY CLINTON'S E-MAILS.\nIT WAS VERY HARD FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND COMEY'S REACH OF THE\nCONCLUSION HE DID AFTER HE LAID OUT THE INDICTING FACTS AGAINST\nHILLARY CLINTON. SO BE IT, THE FBI MADE ITS CALL.\nTHE BIGGEST DANGER IS WHEN POLITICIANS TRY TO INTERVENE AND\nDIRECT THE OUTCOME THAT MUST BE INDEPENDENT COURSE OF\nINVESTIGATION TO SUIT THEIR OWN PURPOSES.\nWHAT DONALD TRUMP SAID LAST NIGHT IS WRONG AND SHOULD NOT BE\nSAID BY ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO BE OUR PRESIDENT.\n>> TO BE FAIR, WE KNOW HE'S BEING CRITICIZED FOR THAT,\nHILLARY CLINTON IS BEING  ING CRITICIZED FOR THIS RESPONSE.\n>> THAT WAS SOMETHING I SAID ABOUT ABRAHAM LINCOLN --\n>> HONEST ABE. HONEST ABE NEVER LIED.\nTHAT'S THE GOOD THING. THAT'S THE BIG DIFFERENCE\nBETWEEN ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND YOU. >> LET'S SET UP THE QUESTION\nABOUT PUBLIC AND PRIVATE AND HOW DO YOU THINK SHE DID WITH THAT\nRESPONSE? >> WHAT'S SO INTERESTING ABOUT\nTHIS IS IF WE HAD BEEN GOING INTO THIS DEBATE WITH ANY\nLEAD-IN OTHER THAN WHAT TRUMP SAID, THIS WOULD BE OUR FIRST\nFOCUS OF WHAT HILLARY CLINTON SAID BEHIND CLOSED DOORS TO WALL\nSTREET EXECUTIVES, INVESTORS. ONE OF THE THINGS SHE SAID IS\nHOW IT'S OKAY FOR A PRESIDENT TO HAVE A PRIVATE POSITION AND A\nPUBLIC POSITION. AND I THINK FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE\nIT REINFORCES WHAT THEY THOUGHT ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON, THAT\nSHE'S SOMEONE WHO IS WILLING TO TAKE A POLITICALLY EXPEDIENT\nPOSITION, THEY CAN'T NECESSARILY TRUST WHAT SHE SAYS.\nI THINK HER ANSWER WASN'T EXACTLY WHAT I WOULD CALL\nFORTHRIGHT. BUT DONALD TRUMP WHILE HE HAD A\nPITHY LINE AND COMEBACK, DIDN'T HAMMER HER ON THIS THROUGHOUT\nTHE DEBATE, WHICH HE COULD HAVE. IN ANY OTHER CONTEXT I THINK WE\nWOULD BE FOCUSING ON THAT, BUT SO MUCH OF WHAT'S HAPPENED IN\nTHE LAST FEW DAYS HAS OVERSHADOWED THAT.\nTHAT'S TO HILLARY CLINTON'S BENEFIT.\n>> WE'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH SOME DEBATE.\nLET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT EVERYONE WAS TALKING ABOUT BEFORE THE\nDEBATE. AFTER THE TAPE, BEFORE THE\nDEBATE, THERE WERE THESE WOMEN IN THE AUDIENCE.\nARI, I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THIS.\nYOU HAVE THREE WOMEN WHO ACCUSED BILL CLINTON OF SEXUAL\nMISCONDUCT. FROM WHAT WE'RE HEARING,\nMR. TRUMP WANTED THEM IN THE VIP BOX, SITTING WITH HIS FAMILY\nMEMBERS BUT THE HEAD OF THE DEBATE COMMISSION SAID, NO IT'S\nONLY FOR FAMILIES ONLY. I DON'T EVEN HAVE THE WORDS.\nYOU WERE WATCHING, ARI. WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THAT?\n>> IT JUST FITS EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS CAMPAIGN.\nTHEY'RE BOTH UNSAVORY CHARACTERS, ALL THREE, BILL\nCLINTON, HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP IS, BROOKE.\nTHAT'S THE ONLY THING I CAN CONCLUDE.\nI THINK DONALD TRUMP IS PERSONALLY OFFENSIVE AND I THINK\nHILLARY CLINTON IS PROFESSIONALLY OFFENSIVE.\nTHIS IS THE CHOICE WE HAVE. AND THE DEBATE LAST NIGHT WHEN\nDONALD TRUMP BROUGHT UP THE ISSUE ABOUT LIBYA AND THE RED --\nOR SYRIA AND THE RED LINE, AND HILLARY SAID, I WASN'T THERE.\nYOU KNOW, THIS IS -- >> SHE WAS BUT SHE WASN'T WHEN\nTHE CHEMICAL WEAPONS WERE USED, CORRECT?\n>> BUT WHEN THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS WERE USED, SHE SUPPORTED BARACK\nOBAMA IN BACKING OFF HIS RED LINE.\nSHE SAID SOMETHING NARROWLY AND ACCURATELY, BUT ON THE BIGGER\nPOLICY POINT, SHE TOTALLY DECEIVED THE COUNTRY WITH HER\nANSWER. THIS IS VINTAGE HILLARY AND THIS\nIS WHAT BOTHERS ME SO MUCH ABOUT THE CHOICE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\nHAVE. >> BEFORE THE DEBATE I THOUGHT\nDAVID AXELROD SAID IT BEST WHEN HE WAS MARINATING ON EVERYTHING\nAND SAID THIS IS ALL PROFOUNDLY SAD.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH. 29 DAYS TO GO.\nWE CONTINUE HERE AS VULGAR AS TRUMP'S WORDS WERE IN THAT\nVIDEO. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME HIS\nTALK ABOUT WOMEN HAS RAISED EYEBROWS, SHALL WE SAY.\nIN FACT, THE CNN DUG THROUGH OLD AUDIO CLIPS OF TRUMP 17-YEAR\nTENURE ON HOWARD STERN. OUR TEAM FOUND HE WAS ONE ON A\nBASHED AND BRAZEN ON THE SUBJECT OF SEX WHEN ASKED ABOUT IT ON\nTHE RADIO FROM COMMENTS ON HAVING SEX WITH WOMEN WHO WERE\nON THEIR MENSTRUAL CYCLES TO TALK OF THREESOMES WITH ONLY\nTHIN WOMEN. HERE IS WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE\nAPPARENT PERKS OF RUNNING BEAUTY PAGEANTS IN A RECORDING FROM\nAPRIL OF 2005. >> I'LL GO BACKSTAGE BEFORE A\nSHOW AND EVERYONE'S GETTING DRESSED AND READY AND EVERYTHING\nELSE. AND I'M ALLOWED TO GO IN BECAUSE\nI'M THE OWNER OF THE PAGEANT AND THEREFORE I'M INSPECTING IT.\nI'M INSPECTING. >> YOU'RE LIKE A DOCTOR.\n>> IS EVERYONE OKAY? THEY'RE STANDING THERE WITH NO\nCLOTHES. IS EVERYONE OKAY?\nYOU SEE THIS INCREDIBLY LOOKING WOMEN.\nAND SO I SORT OF GET AWAY WITH THINGS LIKE THAT.\n>> CNN REACHED OUT TO THE TRUMP CAMP.\nDIDN'T GET ANY COMMENT ON THAT. EARLIER THIS WEEK DONALD TRUMP\nWAS ASKED ABOUT HIS LEWD COMMENTS ON HOWARD STERN AND HE\nTOLD KSNV, QUOTE, A LOT WAS DONE FOR THE PURPOSE OF\nENTERTAINMENT. NOBODY HAS MORE RESPECT FOR\nWOMEN THAN I DO. ANDREW KOZINSKI, WELCOME TO THE\nCNN FAMILY, BY THE WAY, HAS BEEN LOOKING INTO TAPES FROM TRUMP'S\nPAST. BEFORE WE GET INTO THE STERN\nINTERVIEWS, THE THREE WOMEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT SITTING IN\nTHAT AUDIENCE, BILL CLINTON ACCUSERS, YOU ACTUALLY FOUND\nTAPE OF TRUMP TALKING ABOUT THEM IN A MUCH DIFFERENT WAY.\n>> SO, TRUMP BASICALLY FOR ABOUT A TEN-YEAR PERIOD BOTH AT THE\nTIME AND GOING UP TO HIS LATEST 2008 BASICALLY DISMISSED AND\nEVEN MOCKED MANY OF THESE WOMEN, INCLUDING WOMEN HE HAD WITH HIM\nAT THAT PRESS CONFERENCE. THERE WAS PAULA JONES WHO HE\nCALLED A BAD PERSON AND UNATTRACTIVE.\nHE SAID THE SAME ABOUT MONICA LIEU WIN SKI.\nHE SAID BILL CLINTON WAS A VICTIM OF THEM.\nHE BLASTED THE MORALIST HYPOCRITES IN CONGRESS, HE SAID\nPAUL RYAN WAS A LOSER WHO SHOULD HAVE RUN FASTER FROM BILL\nCLINTON. CALLED GENNIFER FLOWERS NOT A\nGOOD WOMAN. HIS LATEST 2008 SAID THE SCANDAL\nWAS TOTALLY UNIMPORTANT. IN '98 AT THE TIME HE\nSYMPATHIZED WITH CLINTON. I THINK WE HAVE A CLIP OF THAT.\n>> LET'S ROLL IT. >> BUT YOU LIKE MRS. CLINTON,\nTOO. IN YOUR BOOK \"THE ART OF THE\nCOMEBACK\" YOU SAY OF MRS.

HE HELD HIS PRESS CONFERENCE\nEARLIER IN THE DAY WITH FOUR OF THEM, AND HERE IS WHAT ONE OF\nTHEM SHARED WITH THE PRESS. >> WE DID RECENTLY, AND MR.\nTRUMP RETWEETED IT, THAT ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS.\nMR.

WHAT DO YOU KNOW?\n>> Reporter: I HEARD IT WAS AN ELECTRIC MOMENT IN THE MINUTES\nLEADING UP TO THE DEBATE. THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN DID WANT\nTHESE WOMEN IN THE VIP BOX, THE FAMILY BOX, AND WAS TRYING TO\nMAKE THAT HAPPEN. THE COMMISSION ON PRESIDENTIAL\nDEBATES WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THIS, IT'S A BIPARTISAN GROUP,\nTHEY SAID, NO, THIS SIMPLY ISN'T GOING TO HAPPEN.\nSO SECURITY WERE BROUGHT IN AND THEY DID KEEP THEM FROM SITTING\nTHERE. THAT WAS AGREED UPON LONG BEFORE\nLAST EVENING. IT WAS STOPPED BY THE\nCOMMISSION. IT WAS ALL, OF COURSE, DESIGNED\nTO SHAKE THINGS UP AND PERHAPS, I GUESS, RATTLE, IF YOU WILL,\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN. BUT THIS IS WHAT JENNIFER\nPALMERI, THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN DIRECTOR, SAID A SHORT TIME AGO\nABOUT IF SECRETARY CLINTON WAS RATTLED.\n>> HE THREATENED TO DO THIS. THIS WAS A THREAT.\nHE FOLLOWED THROUGH ON HIS THREAT.\nIT WAS ALL DESIGNED TO INTIMIDATE HER.\nEVERYTHING ABOUT THE STAGING MADE THAT CLEAR.\nAND IT FAILED. SO THIS WAS HIS BIG THREAT, HE\nFOLLOWED THROUGH, IT HAD NO EFFECT, SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE\nIS GOING TO DO FOR AN ENCORE, BUT SHE IS JUST GOING TO\nCONTINUE TO RUN A RACE. SHE DOESN'T GET RATTLE D VERY\nEASILY. >> Reporter: IT WAS CLEARLY ONE\nOF THE EARLIEST SIGNS, BROOKE, THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE A\nDIFFERENT KIND OF DEBATE, DIFFERENT THAN OTHER\nPRESIDENTIAL DEBATES, AND THAT IT WAS.\nWE'LL SEE IF THESE WOMEN PLAY A ROLE IN THE CAMPAIGN IN THE NEXT\n29 DAYS OR SO. SECRETARY CLINTON WILL BE IN\nOHIO LATER TODAY WHERE I AM RIGHT NOW.\nSOME PEOPLE I TALKED TO AT THE DEBATE LAST NIGHT WERE NOT\nPLEASED BY THAT AT ALL. THEY THINK THAT'S NOT HELPFUL.\nONE OF THE REASONS PAUL RYAN IS NOT GOING TO BE CAMPAIGNING ANY\nMORE FOR DONALD TRUMP AS WELL. BUT CERTAINLY AN INTERESTING BIT\nOF DRAMA AND INTRIGUE RIGHT MOMENTS BEFORE THAT DEBATE\nSTARTED LAST NIGHT. >> LET ME FOLLOW UP WITH YOU\nQUICKLY. OBVIOUSLY THAT WAS TEAM TRUMP'S\nWAY TO KIND OF CHANGE THE NATIONAL DISCOURSE AFTER THE\n2005 TAPE AND ON TO THESE BILL CLINTON ACCUSERS.\nWE JUST SAW, JEFF, HILLARY CLINTON FOR THE FIRST TIME\nHOLDING THAT RALLY, AND ONE OF THE LINES I TOOK NOTE OF IS WHEN\nSHE SAID DONALD TRUMP SHOULD BE APOLOGIZING INSTEAD OF\nATTACKING. WHAT ARE THESE, LINES AND\nMESSAGES YOU THINK WE'LL HEAR FROM TEAM CLINTON IN THESE FINAL\n29 DAYS? >> IT'S CLEAR THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN AND HILLARY CLINTON HERSELF IS TRYING TO SEE HERSELF\nWHAT ARE SOME OPENINGS AMONG REPUBLICANS, WOMEN, AS WELL AS\nMEN, WHO WERE TURNED DOWN BY DONALD TRUMP.\nIT FEATURES REPUBLICANS. A FATHER, A MOTHER, AND ANOTHER\nMOTHER, AND THEY ARE TRYING TO SAY WE CAN'T SUPPORT DONALD\nTRUMP AND HERE'S WHY. >> JEFF ZELANY, THANK YOU VERY\nMUCH.

YOU DON'T WANT TO RAISE YOUR\nKIDS THAT THIS IS ACCEPTABLE LOCKER-ROOM BEHAVIOR, LET'S\nEXCUSE IT BECAUSE THIS IS THE KIND OF STUFF BOYS WILL BE BOYS\nAN TALK ABOUT.

THEY HAVE BUILT HIM UP, HE HAS\nBEEN ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. IT'S NOT THE FACT THAT HE IS\nHILLARY CLINTON'S HUSBAND, HE IS A TOP SURROGATE OUT FOR HER AND\nOUT THERE ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL EVERY SINGLE DAY REPRESENTING\nHER CAMPAIGN. HE WOULD HAVE A MAJOR ROLE.\nSHE HAS TOUTED HIS TIME IN THE WHITE HOUSE.\nWHAT I FIND BAVARO LG -- BAFFLING THAT THE LEFT IS TO\nQUICK AND THE FACT THAT THEY HAD NO PROBLEM EMBRACING BILL\nCLINTON AND THAT'S THE HYPOCRISY THAT AMERICANS SEE.\nWHAT TRUMP NEEDS TO MOVE FORWARD AND MOVE PAST BILL CLINTON\nSTUFF. THERE'S 55% OF AMERICANS THAT\nWANT CHANGES IN TERMS OF ECONOMY AND POLITICS.\nHE NEEDS TO REACH OUT TO VOTERS THAT WANT CHANGE BECAUSE HILLARY\nCLINTON IS THE STATUS QUO. MARTHA: THERE'S A HYPOCRISY,\nJULIE, ON THE LEFT ON THIS ISSUE TO SAY THAT, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE\nSO HORRIFIED, SO DEEPLY, DEEPLY OFFENDED AND I GET IT, THOSE\nCOMMENTS ARE DEEPLY OFFENSIVE, SO I GUESS YOU HAVE TO EITHER\nGET USE TODAY THIS LEVEL OF CRUDENESS BUT LET'S FACE THE\nFACTS THAT IT EXISTS ON BOTH SIDES.\nJULIE: I WILL SPEAK FOR MYSELF AND I CAN'T SPEAK TO ANYBODY\nELSE.

I DON'T THINK THAT'S PROPER OR\nHAVING READ ABOUT THEM THAT I NECESSARILY THINK SHE'S\nINCORRECT IN WHAT SHE SAID. WHAT I FIND DISTURBING THAT THE\nSINS OF THE HUSBAND ARE BEING -- IF YOU LOOK AT JUAN TEA SAID,\nHILLARY CLINTON CAME UP TO HER AFTER SHE VOLUNTEERED FOR BILL\nCLINTON'S CAMPAIGN BACK IN 1976 AND THANKED HER TO HELPING HER\nHUSBAND. JUAN TEA SAID THAT TO MEAN AS A\nTHREAT. I TAKE THAT TO MEAN AS SOMETHING\nTHAT HER HUSBAND DID NOT FILL HER IN AS TO WHAT MAY OR MAY NOT\nHAVE HAPPENED. MARTHA: I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO\nDETAILS OF THIS, BUT -- JULIE: LET ME FINISH MY POINT.\nWHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY IS SOMEHOW RESPONSIBLE FOR HER\nHUSBAND. LISA: THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID.\nJULIE: HE'S NOT ON THE BALLOT, LISA.\nLISA: THE POINT I WAS MAKING IS A FAIR ONE THAT HILLARY CLINTON\nHAS BILL CLINTON OUT THERE, TOP SURROGATES ARE FAIR GAME IN\nPOLITICS. IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE OUT THERE\nEVERY SINGLE DAY REPRESENTING YOUR CAMPAIGN ON THE CAMPAIGN\nTRAIL REACHING OUT TO VOTERS AND MAJOR ROLE IN THE WHITE HOUSE,\nTHAT IS FAIR GAME TO BRING THAT UP.\nSO I THINK DONALD TRUMP INVOKINS FAIR GAME.\nI'M WITH YOU AND EVERYONE IN AMERICA.\nRIGHT NOW -- HOLD ON, JULIE, THE FACT THAT THIS HAS BECOME THE\nNORM IN POLITICS IS DEPRESSING. A LOT OF AMERICANS WANT THE\nISSUES TO BE DISCUSSED BUT BOTH CANDIDATES WERE ROLLING AROUND\nIN THE MUD SO SPARE ME THE FACT THAT SOMEHOW DONALD TRUMP IS\nTHIS MONSTER AND HILLARY CLINTON IS, YOU KNOW, THIS WONDERFUL\nCANDIDATE WHO IS RISING ABOVE IT BECAUSE IT'S SIMPLY NOT THE\nCASE. MARTHA: YOU KNOW, THE FACT OF\nTHE MATTER THAT HE WOULD BE FIRST SPOUSE, MOVED BACK INTO\nTHE WHITE HOUSE AND LIVING THERE.\nI DON'T THINK YOU CAN SAY IT DOESN'T MATTER AT ALL HIS PAST\nCONDUCT BECAUSE YOU ARE IN SOME SENSES ELECTING A COUPLE, A\nFAMILY TO SERVE AND TO REPRESENT.\nI THINK TO THAT EXTENT IT'S FAIR GAME.\nI DO WANT TO GET YOUR THOUGHT ON ONE OTHER THING, THOUGH, THE TAX\nISSUE, WHEN DONALD TRUMP ADMITTED, YES, I TOOK THAT LOSS,\nANDERSON COOPER PRESSED HIM ON IT.\nI TOOK A NEARLY BILLION DOLLAR LOSS, HOW DO YOU THINK IT GOES\nOVER? >> HE SHOULD BE PAYING SOMETHING\nFOR A MILITARY, SOMETHING FOR VETERANS, SOMETHING FOR HEALTH\nCARE, THE REST OF US WHO ARE NOT AS RICH AS HE IS.\nTHE ONE THING ABOUT BILL CLINTON THAT WE HAVE PROVEN BEYOND A\nSHADOW OF A DOUBT THAT HE HAS CHEATED ON HIS WIFE AND DONALD\nTRUMP IN 80's AND 90's WITH HIM AND FIRST WIFE AND SECOND\nWIFE AND MOST PROBABLY WITH WORDS ON THIRD WIFE.\nSO IF THAT'S THE KIND OF MUD WE WANT TO START SLINGING, I'M NOT\nSURE THE PERSON THAT WE SHOULD BE SLINGING IT AT IS THE WIFE\nTHAT WAS VICTIM BECAUSE NOBODY WAS WRONG IN THIS SCENARIO THAN\nHIS WIFE.

THIS CROSSED THRESHOLD.\nWHAT I HEAR HIM SAYING, REGARDLESS OF THE DEBATE\nPERFORMANCE THE THRESHOLD HAS ALREADY --\nSANDRA: BY THE WAY SHEER OBSERVANCE OFDOWN BALLOT TRENDS\nON GOP SIDE WOULD LEAD HIM TO DO THIS THING.\nRYAN HAS SPENT THE PAST FIVE MONTHS TOUTING A BETTER WAY\nAGENDA. REPUBLICANS HAVE TO BE FOR\nTHINGS AND NOT JUST AGAINST THINGS.\nWELL ISN'T THAT SORT OF WHAT HE IS DOING HERE BY SAYING HE IS\nNOT FOR HILLARY CLINTON BUT HE IS AGAINST DONALD TRUMP?\n>> AGAIN, HE IS IN A SURVIVAL MODE, RYAN.\nIT IS HARD TO AT THIS POINT READ HIS MIND BUT HE NEVER LIKED\nTRUMP. RYAN NEVER LIKED HIM, ALL RIGHT?\nSO THEN THERE ARE RUMORS THERE IS MORE STUFF COMING OUT AND ALL\nOF THAT. SO I THINK RYAN IS BASICALLY\nSAYING TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, LOOK, YOU'RE ALL ON YOUR OWN.\nWE'LL HELP YOU BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO REALLY GET BEHIND TRUMP\nIT COULD DESTROY US IF THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE.\nHARRIS: REALLY QUICKLY ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT WAS FOR\nBERNIE SANDERS ON LEFT AND DONALD TRUMP.\nSO MAYBE THIS WON'T MATTER SO MUCH TO SOME VOTERS THAT\nPAUL RYAN HAS PULLED BACK. >> NO, THAT IS NOT GOING TO\nMATTER. HARRIS: IN TERMS OF HIS CORE\nSUPPORT, SPEAKS TO THE ISSUE DID HE EVER REALLY SUPPORT HIM TO\nBEGIN WITH, I THINK THAT IS FAIR QUESTION?\n>> NO, HE NEVER DID. THE FOLKS WILL DECIDE.\nTHIS IS VISCERAL ELECTION. EMOTIONAL ELECTION, I SAID THAT\nLONG TIME AGO, DOESN'T MATTER WHO ENDORSES WHAT NEWSPAPER,\nWHAT COMMENTATOR EVERYBODY IS GOING TO SAY LOOK, I THINK A LOT\nOF PEOPLE WILL STAY HOME. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SHOW.\nDON'T LIKE EITHER OF THEM. SANDRA: EMOTIONAL ELECTION.\nQUICKLY CHANGING ELECTION. THAT CONFERENCE CALL COMING\nAFTER DEBATE DONALD TRUMP APOLOGIZED FOR A LEAKED TAPE.\nCAUGHT HIM MAKING LEWD REMARKS ABOUT WOMEN.\nHE REPEATEDLY CALLED IT LOCKER ROOM TALK AND SAID HE WAS SORRY.\nHILLARY WAS NOT GOING TO LET HIM OFF THE HOOK.\n>> I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTOOD. THIS WAS LOCKER ROOM TALK.\nI'M NOT PROUD OF IT. I APOLOGIZED TO MY FAMILY.\nI APOLOGIZE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\n>> SO FOR THE RECORD YOU SAY YOU NEVER DID THAT?\n>> FRANKLY YOU HEAR THESE THINGS ARE SAID.\nAND I WAS EMBARRASSED BY IT BUT I HAVE TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR\nWOMEN. >> HAVE YOU EVER DONE THOSE\nTHINGS? >> WOMEN HAVE RESPECT FOR ME.\nI WILL TELL YOU, NO, I HAVE NOT. >> WHAT WE ALL SAW AND HEARD ON\nFRIDAY WAS DONALD TALKING ABOUT WOMEN, WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT\nWOMEN, WHAT HE DOES TO WOMEN, BUT, I THINK IT IS CLEAR TO\nANYONE WHO HEARD IT THAT IS REPRESENTS EXACTLY WHO HE IS.\nBECAUSE WE'VE SEEN THIS THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN.\nWE HAVE SEEN HIM INSULT WOMEN. WE'VE SEEN HIM RATE WOMAN ON\nTHEIR APPEARANCE, RANKING THEM FROM ONE TO 10.\nSANDRA: THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE THEN PIVOTED TO ATTACKS ON\nBILL CLINTON'S SEX SCANDALS. HILLARY DID NOT SEEM TO WANT TO\nTAKE THE BAIT, LISTEN. >> IF YOU LOOK AT BILL CLINTON,\nFAR WORSE. MINE ARE WORDS AND HIS WAS\nACTION. , WHAT HE HAS DONE TO WOMEN\nTHERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYBODY IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICS IN THIS\nNATION THAT HAS BEEN SO ABUSIVE TO WOMAN.\nHILLARY CLINTON ATTACKED THOSE SAME WOMEN AND ATTACKED THEM\nVICIOUSLY. FOUR OF THEM HERE TONIGHT.\nONE OF THE WOMEN WHO IS A WONDERFUL WOMAN, AT 12 YEARS\nOLD, WAS RAPED AT 12. HER CLIENT, SHE REPRESENTED GOT\nHIM OFF AND SHE IS SEEN LAUGHING ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS\nLAUGHING AT THE GIRL WHO WAS RAPED.\n>> SO MUCH OF WHAT HE SAID IS NOT RIGHT.\nHE GETS TO RUN HIS CAMPAIGN ANY WAY HE CHOOSES.\nHE GETS TO DECIDE WHAT HE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT, INSTEAD OF\nANSWERING PEOPLE'S QUESTIONS, TALKING ABOUT OUR AGENDA.\nWHEN I HEAR SOMETHING LIKE THAT I AM REMINDED OF WHAT MY FRIEND\nMICHELLE OBAMA ADVISED US ALL, WHEN THEY GO LOW, YOU GO HIGH.\nSANDRA: THAT WAS QUITE A MOMENT LAST NIGHT.\nBILL, WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF DONALD TRUMP UNVOCKING\nBILL CLINTON'S PAST NOT WITH HIS WORDS, BUT AS HE MENTIONED THOSE\nACCUSERS WERE IN THE AUDIENCE? HE SAT THEM FRONT ROW WITH\nMEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY AMONG THEM.\nPAULA JONES, JUANITA BRODERICK. WE HAVE IMAGE THERE.\nTHAT IS YOUR THOUGHTS. >> THAT IS STRATEGY TO SAY OKAY,\nI DID SOMETHING BAD MYSELF ON THE BUS WITH THE ACCESS\nHOLLYWOOD GUY, DON'T BE A HYPOCRITE BECAUSE BILL CLINTON\nDONE WORSE THAN I HAVE, HIS WIFE HILLARY CLINTON, BASICALLY\nDEFENDED HIM. SO IT IS A CLASSIC DEFENSE\nMECHANISM. SANDRA: HOW DID HE HANDLE WITH,\nJUST LOCKER ROOM TALK ON HIS SIDE?\n>> WHAT ELSE IS HE GOING TO SAY? THAT IS WHAT HE IS GOING TO SAY.\nTHEY SIT IN A ROOM, ALL RIGHT, THEY BEING TRUMP AND MAYBE EIGHT\nOR NINE PEOPLE. THEY SAID OKAY, THIS IS A\nDISASTER, RIGHT? THIS IS TERRIBLE.\nSO THEY'RE GOING TO ASK US ABOUT IT.\nWHAT ARE WE GOING TO SAY? THEY COME UP WITH A PHRASE.\nWHAT WAS THE PHRASE WITH BILL CLINTON?\nIT IS ONLY ABOUT SEX, RIGHT? REMEMBER THAT.\nTHAT WAS CARVILLE AND HIS CREW CAME UP WITH THAT EXACTLY THE\nSAME. THIS IS WHAT THESE PEOPLE DO.\nTHEY GIVE IT TO TRUMP. TRUMP SAYS IT FIVE TIMES.\nHE SAID IT FIVE TIMES IN THE DEBATE.\nPEOPLE AT HOME WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF CASTING THE\nBALLOT TO DECIDE ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING TO GIVE TRUMP A PASS ON\nTHIS, OR, VOTE FOR HIM OR I'M NOT, IT IS TOO HORRENDOUS AND I\nDON'T TRUST HIM AND THAT'S IT. SO WE COMMENTATORS, ALL WE CAN\nDO IS PROVIDE PERSPECTIVE. TONIGHT ON MY PROGRAM WE'LL TELL\nBUT THE 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL, WE RESEARCHED CASE, NOBODY KNOWS\nWHAT THAT IS. TUNE IN TONIGHT I WILL HAVE ALL\nOF THAT DATA FOR YOU. >> BILL ARTICULATING MY POINT\nABOUT THRESHOLDS THIS IS SO DIFFERENT ABOUT ANY OTHER\nELECTION IN MY BOOK. IT IS NOT ABOUT COLLECTIVE\nTHOUGHT. ONE PLACE HILLARY CLINTON\nMISSPOKE. THIS IS SO CLEAR.\nIT IS NOT CLEAR AT ALL. EVERY AMERICAN BY THEMSELVES\nHAVE TO DECIDE IF INDEED THAT IS SATISFACTORY TO HEAR TO SAY IT\nIS LOCKER ROOM TALK AND THEY CAN FORGIVE THAT AND MOVE ON AND\nVOTE FOR HIM BECAUSE THEY FEEL HE IS THE REMEDY THEY NEED IN\nWASHINGTON OR YOU KNOW WHAT FOR ME, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH, HE HAS\nGONE TOO FAR. THAT WILL BE THE CHALLENGE THAT\nHE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THIS\nELECTION. KENNEDY: PRESS CONFERENCE WITH\nTHE FOUR VICTIMS. THIS WAS TRUMP CARD.\nTHAT WAS PAGENTRY. THAT WAS DROPPING NUCLEAR BOMB\nLESS THAN 90 MINUTES BEFORE THE DEBATE STARTED.\nKENNEDY: PEOPLE ON STAGE, UNCOMMITTED VOTERS SELECTED BY\nGALLUP BY THE COMMISSION FOR PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES.\nDID THEY HAVE AWARE THE PRESS CONFERENCE WAS UNDERWAY?\nDID THEY GET THEIR PHONES TAKEN AWAY.\n>> THAT IS THE POINT. BAD BEHAVIOR POINTING TO BAD\nBEHAVIOR. KENNEDY: TRUMP WANTS EVERYONE\nTALKING ABOUT THE PRESS CONFERENCE AND NOT THE DEBATE.\n>> THIS IS WHAT THEY DO IN COURTS.\nTHIS IS WHAT 5-YEAR-OLDS DO, HOW CAN YOU PUNISH ME, HE SET THE\nBARN ON FIRE. SO I'M SAYING AMERICAN PEOPLE\nARE SMART ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS.\nEDGE THIS YOU MAKE THE PERSONAL DECISION.\nKENNEDY: I INTERVIEWED KATHLEEN WILLEY LAST NIGHT.\nSHE SAID -- HARRIS: ONE MUCH HIS ACCUSERS.\nKENNEDY: ONE OF HIS ACCUSERS. HE HAS CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH\nTO OF THE WOMEN AT PRESS CONFERENCE.\nHE SAID HILLARY CLINTON IS FAKE FEMINIST.\nFOR HER TO SAY SHE FIGHTS FOR WOMEN AND FIGHTS FOR CHILDREN.\nTHAT WAS PAINFUL, THOSE STATEMENTS ARE PAINFUL TO LISTEN\nTO BECAUSE SHE HAD THE OPPOSITE EXPERIENCE.\nSANDRA: IF ANYTHING IT SHOWED AWKWARD MOMENT, WHEN ACCUSERS\nWERE -- SITTING DOWN IN THE FRONT ROW YOU COULD VERY MUCH\nSEE DISCOMFORT IN BILL CLINTON. HARRIS: FOR ME IT STARTED FROM\nTHE TOP THEY DIDN'T EVEN SHAKE HANDS.\nWE'LL GET INTO THIS LATER. SO YOU MENTIONED THERE IS\nPOTENTIALLY MORE OF THIS TO COME.\nAND YOU TALK ABOUT THAT ROOM WHERE THEY ALL SIT AROUND AND\nTHEY PREPARE FOR THIS. HOW DO YOU PREPARE FOR THAT?\nAT END OF THE FIRST DEBATE AND TALKING ABOUT ALICIA MACHADO\nDONALD TRUMP'S RESPONSE TO HILLARY CLINTON WHERE DID YOU\nGET THAT? THERE COULD BE MORE.\nTHERE COULD BE TAPE, THERE COULD BE AUDIO?\nIS THE PUBLIC GOING TO BE TOLD ABOUT THIS?\nDOES HIS TEAM GET OUT IN ON THE FROM OF IT ALL?\n>> YOU CAN'T GET OUT IN FRONT BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW.\nLISTEN -- HARRIS: THERE IS ANOTHER\nATTACKER THIS MORNING. ANOTHER WOMAN THIS MORNING.\n>> OF COURSE. HARRIS: DO YOU ANSWER EACH ONE\nOR -- >> DON'T WANT TO ANSWER UNLESS\nIT REACHES CRITICAL MASS BUT 90% OF THE MEDIA DESPISES TRUMP.\nJUST DON'T LIKE HIS POLICIES, THEY DON'T LIKE HIM, ALL RIGHT?\nSO THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO FIND OR BUY OR WHATEVER THEY CAN DO\nSTUFF THAT IS GOING TO HURT HIM. AND THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE, YOU\nKNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE LOOKING FOR STUFF ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON\nAND THINGS LIKE THAT. SO THERE IS FOUR WEEKS LEFT.\nFOUR WEEKS FROM TOMORROW. KENNEDY: HOW MUCH DIRTIER CAN IT\nGET? >> LOOK, TRUMP IS A RICH GUY DID\nPRETTY MUCH WHAT HE WANTED TO DO FOR 40 YEARS, OKAY?\nAND SO THERE COULD BE STUFF. SANDRA: WE WANT TO GET THIS IN.\nLATEST \"NBC/WALL STREET JOURNAL\" TAKEN SATURDAY AND SUNDAY BEFORE\nTHE DEBATE HAPPENED LAST NIGHT SHOWING HILLARY CLINTON NOW WITH\nAN 11-POINT LEAD NATIONALLY OVER DONALD TRUMP.\n>> YEAH. THAT IS PREDICTABLE.\nTHAT WILL SHRINK AFTER THE DEBATE.\nBUT, MRS. CLINTON HAS A FIRM LEAD AND I WOULD SAY THE ODDS\nARE THAT SHE WILL WIN THE ELECTION.\nTHE THIRD DEBATE, YOU KNOW, THAT MEANS SOMETHING BUT RIGHT NOW\nTHE SECRETARY'S IN FRONT, NO DOUBT.\nHARRIS: DO YOU PUT ODDS DIFFERENT NOW THAN IN THE PAST?\n>> SURE. THIS TAPE REALLY HURT\nDONALD TRUMP. AND, YOU KNOW, IT IS ONE OF\nTHESE THINGS WHERE YOU SIT AT HOME, AND PEOPLE GO WHO'S WORSE?\nIT IS NOT WHO IS BETTER. HARRIS: THE REASON I ASK THAT,\nTHE THE NEWS OF HIM SAYING THINGS\nLIKE THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY NEW.\nIS IT JUST GOT CAUGHT ON TAPE? >> YEAH, TAPE.\n>> HEARD HIS VOICE SAYING. >> THE LANGUAGE IS STARK, OKAY?\nKENNEDY: THE ATTITUDE. >> \"NEW YORK TIMES\" PRINTED\nTHING ON PAGE 1, WITH ALL FOUR-LETTER WORDS.\nHARRIS: I DID NOT SEE THAT. >> YEAH.\nYOU GO, OKAY, LOOK WE KNOW YOU HATE HIM, BUT WE KNOW YOU HATE\nTRUMP, ALL RIGHT, DO YOU HAVE TO DO THIS?\nAND THEY DID. >> CLASSLESS.\nKENNEDY: THOSE OF US WITH MIDDLE-SCHOOLER TRYING TO READ\nTHE NEWSPAPER A BIT DISCONCERTING.\n>> I THOUGHT IT WAS TERRIBLE",

HYDRA MA LAST NIGHT BECAUSE\nDONALD TRUMP WAS ON THE ROPES. THE VULGAR TAPE AND WALL TO WALL\nREPORTING OF IT HAS THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE IN A VERY\nBAD PLACE BUT TRUMP AGAINST ALL ODDS WON THE DEBATE.\nHE WON BECAUSE SECRETARY CLINTON COULD NOT KNOCK HIM OUT AND\nAFTER THE FIRST 30 MINUTES TRUMP WENT ON OFFENSE, REGAINING AT\nLEAST SOME MOMENTUM.

FOUR OF THEM HERE TONIGHT.\nONE OF THE WOMEN WHO IS A WONDERFUL WOMAN, AT 12 YEARS OLD\nWAS RAPED AT 12.

CLINTON JUMPED ON THAT SAYING THAT TRUMP IS NEVER\nCONTRITE. >> HE NEVER APOLOGIZES FOR\nANYTHING TO ANYONE. HE NEVER APOLOGIZED TO MR. AND\nMRS. KHAN, THE GOLD STAR FAMILY WHOSE SON CAPTAIN KHAN DIED IN\nTHE LINE OF DUTY IN IRAQ AND DONALD INSULTED AND ATTACKED\nTHEM FOR WEEKS OVER THEIR RELIGION.\nAND HE NEVER APOLOGIZED FOR THE RACIST LIE THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA\nWAS NOT BORN IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\nHE OWES THE PRESIDENT AN APOLOGY.\n>> MR. TRUMP SEIZED UPON THE OBAMA REFERENCE TO LOB THIS GRENADE.\n>> MICHELLE OBAMA, I'VE GOTTEN TO SEE THE COMMERCIALS THAT THEY\nDID ON YOU.

JOINING ME NOW IS STEPHANIE\nSHIARIK, STEPHANIE, I JUST WANT TO GET YOUR TAKE FROM THE\n\"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD\" TAPE, THE FIRST TIME WE'RE ABLE TO SPEAK\nWITH YOU SINCE IT EXPLODED, AND WE SORT OF MARINATED IN IT OVER\nTHE WEEKEND. WHAT DO YOU TAKE, WHAT DO YOU\nTAKE AWAY FROM DONALD TRUMP'S LANGUAGE AND ULTIMATELY, FROM\nHIS COMMENTS LAST NIGHT. NO APOLOGY SOME WOULD SAY, AND\nHE SAID I DIDN'T DO THOSE THINGS.\nTHEY ARE WORDS, NO THE ACTIONS. >> WELL, LIKE SO MANY AMERICANS\nACROSS THE COUNTRY, WHEN I SAW THE TAPE ON FRIDAY NIGHT, I\nREMEMBER SITTING DOWN WITH MY STAFF AND WE JUST RAN OUT OF\nWORDS TO TALK ABOUT HOW DISGUSTING AND DISAPPOINTING AND\nAWFUL AND OFFENSIVE IT ALL IS, AND YOU COULD SEE THAT WITH THE\nREACTIONS OF REPUBLICANS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AS WELL.\nI THINK WHAT WOMEN VOTERS IN PARTICULAR WERE LOOKING FOR LAST\nNIGHT, AND REPUBLICAN LEADERS, WAS DONALD TRUMP TO STAND IN\nFRONT OF EVERYBODY AND SAY I'M SORRY, AND BE A LITTLE CONTRITE\nABOUT IT. AND THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT WE\nDID NOT GET. I DON'T KNOW WHY ANYBODY SHOULD\nBE SURPRISED, SINCE HE STARTED THIS CAMPAIGN A YEAR AND A HALF\nAGO, HE HAS REALLY LAID THE GROUNDWORK BASED ON OFFENSIVE\nLANGUAGE AND ATTACKING MEXICANS, MUSLIMS, WOMEN OF ALL\nBACKGROUNDS. >> SURE.\n>> IT JUST CONTINUES AND CONTINUES.\nTHIS IS JUST WHO HE IS. AND IT IS ALSO HIS ACTIONS, AND\nTHAT'S WHAT IS SO SHOCKING ABOUT THE AUDIO AND VIDEO FROM FRIDAY.\nI MEAN, HERE IS SOMEONE WHO IS BRAGGING ABOUT IN ESSENCE A\nSEXUAL A ASSAULT, THE VIOLENCE IS REALLY DAMAGING.\n>> LET ME ASK YOU, BECAUSE HE SAID AGAIN, THIS IS THE POINT\nTHAT DONALD TRUMP MAKES, THIS IS NOT VIOLENCE.\nTHEY WERE WORDS. COMPARE THAT HE SAYS TO BILL\nCLINTON'S VIOLENT ACTIONS, AS HE SAYS, SEXUAL MISCONDUCT THAT'S\nBEEN UNSUBSTANTIATED. BUT FOUR WOMEN, INVITED BY\nTRUMP, WHAT PRODUCED THIS REALLY UNIQUE UNPRECEDENTED\nCONFRONTATION LAST NIGHT. DID THESE WOMEN HAVE A POINT\nWHEN THEY ARGUE THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS IN FACT AN ENABLER IN\nA SITUATION LIKE THIS? >> WELL, FIRST, THESE AREN'T\nJUST DONALD TRUMP'S WORDS. THEY ARE ACTIONS, AND WE'VE\nHEARD LOTS OF WOMEN COME UP AND TALK ABOUT THAT.\nAND HERE HE IS LAST NIGHT WITH THE ONLY THING HE COULD POSSIBLY\nDO, WHICH IS TO GO LOWER AND BRING IN HILLARY CLINTON'S\nMARRIAGE AS AN ATTACK. THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT\nREPUBLICANS AND I WOULD ARGUE, ALL OF US, WERE WARNING HIM NOT\nDO. REPUBLICAN LEADERS, DON'T GO\nTHERE. AND HE DID.\nIT WAS VERY DANGEROUS. >> TO PLAY DEVIL'S ADVOCATE,\nHILLARY CLINTON SUPPORTERS SAY DONALD TRUMP SHOWS HIS LACK OF\nFITNESS TO BE PRESIDENT. TRUMP SUPPORTERS WOULD SAY THE\nWAY THAT HILLARY CLINTON HANDLED THOSE PAST SCANDALS, CRISES,\nDEMONSTRATES HER LACK OF FITNESS.\nIS THAT AN UNFAIR ARGUMENT? >> I THINK YOU SAW WHY HILLARY\nCLINTON IS COMPLETELY PREPARED TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES LAST NIGHT. WITH ALL OF THIS CHAOS GOING ON\nAROUND HER, SHE STOOD IN FRONT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND MADE\nA CASE FOR HER TO BE THE PRESIDENT AND IN A CALM,\nGRACEFUL MANNER, SHOWING GREAT LEADERSHIP, TALKED ABOUT WHAT\nVOTERS REALLY CARE ABOUT. WHICH IS HOW DO WE MAKE THIS\nCOUNTRY EVEN GREATER THAN IT IS. AND THAT'S WHERE I JUST THOUGHT\nSHE SHINED LAST NIGHT. >> STEPHANIE FROM EMILY'S LIST,\nWE APPRECIATE YOU BEING WITH US.

THAT'S OFFENSIVE TOO.\nHERE'S THE REALITY. WE HAVE TWO FLAWED CANDIDATES.\nONE WILL BE OUR PRESIDENT.

AND ALSO WITH US FROM CAMBRIDGE,\nMASSACHUSETTS, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST AND FORMER DEPUTY\nCAMPAIGN MANAGER FOR CARLY FIORINA THIS CYCLE, SARAH ISGER\nFLORES. LADIES, GREAT TO BE WITH YOU.\nSARAH, I WANT TO START WITH YOU. TELL ME WHAT YOUR TOPLINE\nIMPRESSIONS WERE OF THE DEBATE LAST NIGHT.\n>> SO, I DO THINK THAT TRUMP STOPPED THE BLEEDING.\nI THINK THE PROBLEM IS, HE HAD ALREADY LOST SIX PINTS OF BLOOD\nBEFORE THE DEBATE EVEN STARTED. THE FIRST 20 MINUTES WERE ROUGH.\nIT WAS KIND OF THE FLIP OF LAST TIME.\nI THOUGHT HE WON THE FIRST 20 MINUTES LAST TIME, BUT LOST THE\nREST OF THE DEBATE. THIS TIME, I THINK HE LOST THE\nFIRST 20 MINUTES, BUT WON THE REST OF THE DEBATE, BUT IT\nDOESN'T MATTER. HE LEFT WITHOUT NOT CHANGING THE\nMAP AND THAT'S THE ONLY GOAL HE REALLY HAD.\n>> SARAH, YOU'RE SAYING IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE HE'S\nDEAD, POLITICALLY. IS THAT YOUR VIEW?\nA LOT OF REPUBLICAN STRATEGISTS SAID HE WAS DEAD WHEN -- HE WAS\nA DEAD MAN WALKING WHEN HE CAME ON TO THE DEBATE STAGE LAST\nNIGHT AND, YOU KNOW, HE'S STILL THAT DEAD MAN WALKING, BUT HE'S\nA DEAD MAN. IS THAT RIGHT?\nIS THAT YOUR VIEW? >> I THINK THAT'S RIGHT.\nAND I THINK THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN MUST AGREE, BECAUSE THIS \"LIGHT\nIT ON FIRE\" STRATEGY, IT'S CERTAINLY UNTESTED.\n>> RIGHT. OKAY, LIZ, AS YOU WATCHED TODAY\nAND READ ABOUT TODAY, PAUL RYAN TALKING TO HIS MEMBERS AND\nSAYING THE THINGS THAT HE SAID, NO LONGER IN THE CAMPAIGN WITH\nDONALD TRUMP, NOT GOING TO DEFEND HIM, DOING EVERYTHING\nNEGATIVE HE COULD DO SHY OF DISENDORSING HIM, AND TELLING\nALL HIS MEMBERS THAT THEY CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT, THEY SHOULD\nSAVE THEIR SKINS. YOU LOOKED AT THAT AND THOUGHT\nWHAT WITH REGARD TO PROSPECTS IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE?\n>> I THOUGHT A LOT OF THINGS. I THOUGHT IT'S A VERY GOOD SIGN\nFOR DEMOCRATS, BECAUSE IT SHOWS THEY ARE CONCERNED THAT HE'S\nGOING TO BE A BIG DRAG ON THE TICKET.\nAND TO CONTINUE SARAH'S METAPHOR, YOU KNOW, I THINK AT\nTHE END OF THE DEBATE LAST NIGHT, HE PUT ON A TOURNIQUET,\nSTOPPED THE BLEEDING. BUT DONALD TRUMP RIPPED OFF THAT\nTOURNIQUET TODAY BY STARTING THIS CIVIL WAR WITH PAUL RYAN.\nAND I THINK WE COULD SEE SOME OF THE BLEEDING AND SOME OF THE\nLOSS OF SUPPORT START AGAIN, NOW THAT HE'S STARTED THIS DIVISIVE\nCAMPAIGN. YOU KNOW, IT'S ALMOST LIKE\nDONALD TRUMP HAS DECIDED, LOOK, IF I'M GOING TO GO DOWN, I'M\nTAKING THE REST OF THE PARTY WITH ME.\nAND LOOK, AS A DEMOCRAT, I'M FINE WITH THAT.\nAND I THINK THAT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE\nOF THAT SITUATION. TURN THEIR FOCUS AWAY FROM\nDONALD TRUMP, AND START CAMPAIGNING WITH DEMOCRATS IN\nCLOSE RACES, WHERE SHE CAN BE A HELP.\nAND MAKE SURE THAT THEY TIE THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES TO DONALD\nTRUMP. AND, YOU KNOW, IF SHE DOES THAT,\nTHERE'LL BE MORE DEMOCRATS SUPPORTING HER.\nTHERE'LL BE MORE DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS, MORE DEMOCRATS IN THE\nSENATE. AND MORE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS.\nAND GOVERNORS HELP DETERMINE THE MAKEUP OF THE CONGRESSIONAL\nLINES IN 2022. >> I ACTUALLY DISAGREE WITH\nTHAT. I THINK THIS IS ACTUALLY\nEXTREMELY BAD FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nYOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE A PRESIDENT WHO WANTS A MANDATE GOING INTO\nTHE WHITE HOUSE, YOU WANT A STRONG OPPONENT THAT YOU\nOVERCOME AND STILL WIN. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN HERE IS\nHER NEGATIVES ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO TICK UP.\nTWO-THIRDS OF THE VOTERS DON'T THINK SHE'S TRUSTWORTHY TO BEGIN\nWITH. AND THEN SHE'S GOING TO WIN AN\nELECTION THAT EVERYONE ASSUMES SHE HAD TO WIN BY DEFAULT\nANYONE. SO SHE'S GOING TO GO INTO THE\nWHITE HOUSE WITHOUT A MANDATE. IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE SHE'LL HAVE\nPARTICULARLY LONG COATTAILS HEADING IN THERE.\nA LOT OF THESE REPUBLICAN SENATE CANDIDATES ARE RUNNING, SEVEN,\nNINE POINTS AHEAD OF DONALD TRUMP.\nSO THAT MEANS HILLARY'S NOT HELPING HER DOWN-BALLOTS.\nSHE'S GOING TO GO IN AS POTENTIALLY THE LEAST-FAVORABLE,\nLEAST-TRUSTED PRESIDENT ON INAUGURATION DAY IN THE HISTORY\nOF AMERICAN POLITICS, SINCE WE'VE BEEN RUNNING THE DATA.\nSO THAT MAKES HER A VERY WEAK INCOMING PRESIDENT AND VERY\nLIKELY A ONE-TERM PRESIDENT. >> WELL, YOU COULD SAY THAT\nTODAY, BUT, REMEMBER MARK FOLEY IN 2006?\nTHINGS CAN TURN ON A DIME. AND SO, I'D SAY, YOU KNOW, WAIT\nAND SEE. >> SO I WANT TO ASK YOU GUYS\nBOTH A QUESTION AS BOTH AS POLITICAL STRATEGISTS AND BOTH\nAS WOMEN. THIS IS A QUESTION I THINK\nYOU'RE GOING TO AGREE ON. SARAH FIRST.\nPUTTING ASIDE THE POLITICS OF IT, WERE YOU OFFENDED BY THE\nTAPE THAT CAME OUT OF DONALD TRUMP, THE OF MIKE TAPE THAT\nCAME OUT ON FRIDAY AND THE THINGS THAT HE SAID?\nDO YOU FIND THAT OFFENSIVE PERSONALLY BEYOND THE POLITICAL\nIMPLICATIONS OF IT? >> YES.\n>> LIZ? >> LIZ?\n>> LIZ, DO YOU FIND IT OFFENSIVE PERSONALLY AS WELL AS\nTI PROBLEMATIC? >> I FIND IT DEEPLY, VISCERALLY\nOFFENSIVE. AND I THINK ANY WOMAN WHO\nWATCHED IT DID. AND THIS IS THE THING.\nBECAUSE ANY GUY THAT BRAGS ABOUT COMMITTING SEXUAL ASSAULT\nPROBABLY HAS COMMITTED SEXUAL ASSAULT.\n>> RIGHT. OKAY, SO YOU GUYS ARE IN\nAGREEMENT ABOUT THIS, RIGHT? I ASSUMED YOU WOULD BE.\nSO DONALD TRUMP IN THIS BUILDING RIGHT NEXT TO WHERE I'M SITTING\nRIGHT NOW IN AMBRIDGE, PENNSYLVANIA, WENT FURTHER EVEN\nTHAN HE DID YESTERDAY IN LAYING OUT THE CASE HE'S BEEN DIEING TO\nMAKE FOR MONTHS, WHICH IS THAT BILL CLINTON WAS GUILTY OF\nSERIAL ABUSE OF WOMEN FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS.\nTHERE ARE MANY, MANY INSTANCES OF IT.\nAND THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS COMPLICIT IN HAVING INTIMATED\nTHOSE WOMEN, IN HAVING SHAMED THEM AND DISMISSED THEM,\nBEHAVING IN A KIND OF COMPLICIT WITH HER HUSBAND.\nSO WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? >> FIRST OF ALL, IT'S ABSOLUTELY\nTRUE. IT TURNS OUT, WE CAN HAVE TWO\nHORRIBLE PEOPLE RUNNING FOR OFFICE FOR THE PRESIDENCY AT THE\nSAME TIME AND WE'RE RUNNING THAT EXPERIMENT RIGHT NOW.\nI ABSOLUTELY THINK THAT BOTH SIDES OF THIS TICKET HAVE\nENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF SHARED BLAME ON THIS ISSUE.\nTHAT BEING SAID, TWO WRONGS DON'T MAKE A RIGHT.\nJUST BECAUSE BILL CLINTON DID IT DOESN'T EXCUSE DONALD TRUMP FROM\nDOING IT. JUST BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON\nWENT AFTER HIS ACCUSERS DOESN'T EXCUSE DONALD TRUMP FROM\nBRAGGING ABOUT IT. DO I THINK POLITICALLY IT WORKS?\nWE COULD HAVE RUN THAT EXPERIMENT WITH A DIFFERENT\nSITUATION. DONALD TRUMP ALREADY WENT INTO\nTHIS VIDEO LOSING AND HE NEEDED TO GAIN GROUND.\nHE NEEDED TO CHANGE THE CONVERSATION TO DO THAT.\nSO I DON'T THINK WE CAN KNOW WHETHER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN\nEFFECTIVE. IT WON'T BE EFFECTIVE NOW.\n>> YEAH, I GOT TO AGREE. I DON'T THINK IT'S AN\nEFFECTIVE -- IT'S NOT AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY AT ALL.\nIT'S JUST GOING TO MAKE HER SEEM MORE SYMPATHETIC.\nAND RALLY WOMEN OF ALL POLITICAL STRIPES TO HER SIDE.\nAND THE ONLY PEOPLE I CAN SEE THIS APPEALING TO ARE -- IS THE\nCLINTON DERANGEMENT SYNDROME WING OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\nAND IT IS OFFENSIVE TO WOMEN THAT THIS IDEA THAT SHE SHOULD\nHAVE TO PAY FOR HER HUSBAND'S SINS -- SO I THINK IT'S A BIG\nTACTICAL ERROR ON HIS PART. >> BUT, LIZ, YOU WOULD AGREE\nTHAT IF YOU FOUND THE VIDEO OFFENSIVE FROM DONALD TRUMP, YOU\nALSO FOUND BILL CLINTON'S HISTORY OFFENSIVE AS WELL.\n>> YES, BUT AGAIN, THAT'S SOMETHING WE DEALT WITH 20 YEARS\nAGO. AND I'M NOT SITTING HERE TO -- I\nJUST REFERRED TO BILL CLINTON'S SINS, BUT THAT WAS SOMETHING WE\nLITIGATED 20 YEARS AGO. IT WAS -- WE'VE PLAYED IT ALL\nOUT. WE'VE HAD THIS DISCUSSION.\nAND IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HILLARY CLINTON.\nHILLARY CLINTON IS RUNNING. BILL CLINTON IS NOT ON THE\nTICKET. >> OKAY.\nLIZ, SARAH, YOU GUYS ARE BOTH FANTASTIC AND WE'RE REALLY\nGRATEFUL FOR YOU BEING ON THE SHOW.\nI REALLY WANT TO SET UP A BLOCK WHERE I GET THE TWO OF YOU ON\nOUR SET WITH KELLYANNE CONWAY AND I WANT TO HEAR YOU GUYS ALL\nDISCUSS THIS SAME MATTER, BECAUSE I THINK IT WOULD BE A\nFASCINATING DISCUSSION. SHE CLEARLY DISAGREES WITH YOU\nGUYS AND SO DOES DONALD TRUMP, OBVIOUSLY.\nTHANK YOU FOR DOING THE SHOW. WE'LL CHECK IN NEXT WITH A\nREPORTER WHO'S COVERING HILLARY CLINTON HERSELF ON THE CAMPAIGN\nTRAIL TODAY, WHEN WE COME BACK.",

I MEAN, FIRST OF ALL THERE WERE\n2.5 MILLION PHONES WORLDWIDE INVOLVED IN THE INITIAL GALAXY\nNOTE 7 RECALL. 1 MILLION IN THE U.S.\nSAMSUNG HAD THIS REPLACEMENT PROGRAM SAYING WE'VE FIGURED OUT\nWHAT THE PROBLEM WAS, IT WAS A BATTERY SUPPLIER, WE FIXED THAT\nHERE.

AND YET FIVE OF THESE SUPPOSEDLY\nSAFE PHONES HAVE NOW HAD ISSUES, TWO IN KENTUCKY, ONE IN\nMINNESOTA, ONE IN VIRGINIA, ANOTHER IN TEXAS.\nALL OF THE MAJOR CARRIERS NOW ARE ALLOWING PEOPLE TO TRADE IN\nEVEN THEIR REPLACEMENT PHONES ALL BUT SPRINT HAS SAID THEY'VE\nSTOPPED SELLING THEM ALTOGETHER. SPRINT HAS NOT SAID THAT AT THIS\nPOINT, BUT WHAT'S CONCERNING IS THAT SAMSUNG HAS NOT\nACKNOWLEDGED THE PROBLEM YET WITH THESE REPLACEMENT PHONES.\nTHEY SIMPLY SAID THAT THEY'RE HALTING PRODUCTION, THEY'RE\nWORKING WITH A CONSUMER PRODUCTS SAFETY COMMISSION ON THIS.\nBUT THE CARRIERS HAVE ALREADY MOVED AND THE IMAGES OF BURNED\nOUT REPLACEMENT PHONES ARE ONLINE.\nSO THERE'S MASSIVE POTENTIAL FOR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE HERE WITH\nSAMSUNG BECAUSE CONSUMERS OBVIOUSLY DON'T KNOW IF THEY CAN\nBELIEVE WHAT THE COMPANY'S TELLING THEM.\n>> ONE REASON WHY APPLE STOCK IS UP 1.65% THIS MORNING, I GUESS,\nGIVEN THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE AND THE FACT THEIR PHONES DON'T\nCATCH FIRE. >> ABSOLUTELY, DAVID.\nGOOD FOR APPLE PARTICULARLY WITH SINCE THE iPHONE 7 AND 7 PLUS,\nTHE BIGGER INNOVATION IS IN THE HIGH END PHONE, THE LARGER PHONE\nTHAT COMPETES MORE DIRECTLY WITH THE GALAXY NOTE 7.\nSO IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A BIGGER PHONE, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU\nWANT, WELL, YOU CAN'T HAVE ONE FROM SAMSUNG.\nYOU'VE PRETTY MUCH GOT TO GO TO APPLE OR MAYBE HANG ONTO THAT\nPHONE. YOU CAN LOOK AT WHAT GOOGLE'S\nGOT.

SMARTPHONES ARE A PRODUCT ON A\nSCALE UNLIKE ANY OTHER, AND THEN A RECALL AND THEN ISSUES WITH\nTHE REPLACEMENTS FROM THE RECALL.\nANY BUZZ OUT THERE ON THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON SAMSUNG'S\nBRAND? >> WELL, I THINK, JOHN, FIRST OF\nALL YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH\nPATRICK MOREHEAD OF MORE INSIGHTS AND STRATEGY, A GUY YOU\nKNOW VERY WELL. MR. MOREHEAD HAS BEEN WORKING IN\nTECH FOR 20, 25 YEARS, WORKED AT COMPACT, WORKED AT AND, AND TO\nYOUR POINT, JOHN, PATRICK SAYS THIS IS SIMPLY UNPRECEDENTED.\nHE'S NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS.\nYES, YOU SEE RECALLS OF CONSUMER ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS, BUT IF IT\nREALLY IS TRUE THAT THE REPLACEMENT TURNS OUT TO BE AS\nUNSTABLE AND UNSAFE AS THE ORIGINAL, THAT WOULD BE REALLY\nUNPRECEDENTED. AND THIS -- LET'S ALSO READ TO\nOUR VIEWERS HERE THE STATEMENT THAT SAMSUNG HAS GIVEN US TO\nDATE. SAMSUNG SAYING, \"WE RECOGNIZE\nTHAT CARRIER PARTNERS HAVE STOPPED SALES AND EXCHANGES OF\nTHE GALAXY NOTE7 IN RESPONSE TO REPORTS OF HEAT DAMAGE ISSUES,\nAND WE RESPECT THEIR DECISION. WE ARE WORKING DILIGENTLY WITH\nAUTHORITIES AND THIRD PARTY EXPERTS AND WILL SHARE FINDINGS\nWHEN WE HAVE COMPLETED THE INVESTIGATION.\"\nI THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT WE THOUGHT WE UNDERSTOOD\nWHAT THE ISSUE WAS, YOU KNOW, LITHIUM BATTERIES ARE LIKE\nCONTROLLED EXPLOSIONS, THEY GET OUT OF CONTROL, THEY EXPLODE.\nTHE NARRATIVE WAS THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM IN THE CHEMISTRY OF\nTHOSE BATTERIES, THERE WERE TWO SUPPLIERS, SAMSUNG AND THIS\nCHINESE COMPANY, BUT THAT THE PROBLEM HAD BEEN ADDRESSED, IT\nWAS UNDERSTOOD, IT WAS FIXED, WE COULD MOVE ON, BUT NOW, OF\nCOURSE, FOR CONSUMERS, FOR INVESTORS WATCHING, THAT\nNARRATIVE IS IN QUESTION. GUYS?\n>> APPLE IS HEADING HIGHER, PERHAPS IN PART ON THIS NEWS\nTHAT ITS CHIEF COMPETITOR IS HAVING TROUBLE WITH THESE HIGH\nEND LARGER PHONES, THE VERY SAME TIER WHERE APPLE PUT MOST OF ITS\nRND EFFORT WITH THE iPHONE 7 PLUS.\nAPPLE STOCK IS UP 20% OVER THE LAST THREE MONTHS NOW.\nWHAT IS THE POTENTIAL FOR GOOGLE TO SEE AN OPENING HERE?\nIT JUST LAUNCHED THE PIXEL PHONE LAST WEEK.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT SAMSUNG HAD THE ANDROID\nECOSYSTEM LOCKED UP. PERHAPS NOT ANYMORE?\n>> YEAH, I THINK IT'S A GREAT QUESTION, JOHN.\nSO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE NOTE7, THAT WAS GOING TO BE\nSAMSUNG'S ANSWER TO APPLE, BECAUSE IT DID HAVE THESE\nDIFFERENT FEATURES, SO THE OLD DISPLAY, THE PEN, THE IDEA BEING\nIF YOU WERE GOING TO MOVE PEOPLE FROM APPLE, MAYBE THIS WAS IT.\nTHE QUESTION NOW IS WHAT DO CONSUMERS DO.\nONCE THEY POWER DOWN THAT NOTE7, DO THEY STICK WITH SAMSUNG?\nTHE S7, THE S7 EDGE ARE POPULAR DEVICES.\nSAMSUNG DOES HAVE A LOYAL BASE. OR DO THOSE CONSUMERS DECIDE\nTHEY ARE GOING TO MOVE TO OTHER ANDROID DEVICES?\nI KNOW MR. MOREHEAD THINKS MAYBE YOU SEE SOME MOVEMENT TO LG, TO\nYOUR POINT MAYBE GOOGLE'S PIXEL PHONE.\nWHAT'S IT MEAN FOR APPLE, AS WELL?\nFINANCIAL ANALYSTS ARE TRYING TO GAUGE THAT.\nI KNOW DOES THINK THE BRAND DAMAGE RIGHT NOW BEING DONE TO\nSAMSUNG WILL BENEFIT APPLE. THE QUESTION THEN IS FOR OUR\nAUDIENCE, FOR TRADERS, INVESTORS, HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK\nIT BENEFITS? YOU KNOW, IF YOU LOOK AT THAT\nHIGH END, SO LET'S SAY $400 AND UP, THAT IS APPLE'S WORLD, THE\nSHARE THERE IS 55%. SO IF THEY DO BENEFIT, THE\nBENEFIT WILL BE INCREMENTAL, BUT THEN AGAIN, LISTEN, SMARTPHONE\nWARS ARE HEATED, THEY ARE INTENSE, THE COMPETITION IS\nREAL. EVEN INCREMENTAL BENEFIT WOULD\nBE PRETTY BIG NEWS. GUYS?\n>> IT WOULD INDEED. JOSH LIPTON, THANKS.\nOF COURSE, WE'RE GOING TO",

SALES WILL BE HALTED UNTIL\nTHINGS ARE FURTHER INVESTIGATED. BUT ONE PERSON'S MISFORTUNE IS\nANOTHER PERSON'S OPPORTUNITY. SHARES OF APPLE MOVING HIGHER,\nHITTING A YEAR TO DATE HIGH. HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE DECEMBER, UP\nBY MORE THAN 2%. SO ARE SAMSUNG'S BATTERY\nPROBLEMS A HUGE WIN FOR APPLE? JOINING US IS TIM LONG, SENIOR\nANALYST AT BMO CAPITAL MARKETS. GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US.\nSEEMS LIKE IT IS NOT JUST THE REPLACEMENT ISSUE, BUT THE\nCARRIERS COMING OUT SAYING WE WILL TAKE BACK YOUR SAMSUNG\nPHONE, BUT ALSO ALLOW YOU TO CHOOSE ANY PHONE THAT YOU WANT\nTHAT SEEMS TO BE THE REAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TODAY AND\nLAST WEEK. >> YEAH, DEFINITELY.\nCLEARLY A BIG MESS UP FOR SAMSUNG AND A BAD TIME HERE WITH\nTHE NEW iPHONE 7 COMING OUT. IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR APPLE.\nIN THE NEAR TERM, SAMSUNG ONLY SHIPS 5 MILLION OR 6 MILLION\nNOTES A QUARTER. IT IS NOT A HUGE NUMBER.\nAND A FAIR AMOUNT OF THOSE PEOPLE MAKE LIKE THE ANDROID\nPLATFORM OR SAMSUNG. BUT CERTAINLY THE BRAND DAMAGE\nAT A TIME WHERE APPLE DOES HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF MOMENTUM\nPROBABLY ADDS FURTHER TO THE GAME IN SUBSCRIBER BASE THAT\nTHEY HAVE BEEN GETTING, WHICH IS REAL IMPORTANT FOR THE COMPANY.\n>> SEEMS LIKE THE WORST POSSIBLE TIMING FOR SAMSUNG GIVEN NOT\nONLY APPLE AS A NEW PHONE, BUT GOOGLE HAS A NEW PHONE TOO THAT\nRUNS ANDROID. IF YOU'RE AN ANDROID LOVER, YOU\nMAY SWITCH OVER TO A NEW GOOGLE PHONE.\n>> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. AS WE KNOW, THE ANDROID CAMP IS\nMUCH MORE FRAGMENTED, SO LG, SONY, A LOT OF OTHER COMPANIES\nAND A LOT OF CHINESE COMPANIES AS WELL ARE MAKING PHONES.\nSO ON A GLOBAL BASIS, THIS DOES REALLY OPEN THE DOORS FOR OTHERS\nTO CRACK INTO SAMSUNG'S LEAD. SO IT IS LIKELY THAT A FAIR\nAMOUNT OF THOSE PEOPLE WILL STAY WITH THE ANDROID PLATFORM.\nBUT PART OF OUR THESIS ON APPLE HAS BEEN THEY ARE TAKING A GOOD\nAMOUNT OF MARKET SHARE FROM SAMSUNG AT THE HIGH END AND EVEN\nFROM SOME OTHER BRANDS THAT ARE MOVING UP MARKET FROM THE\nMIDTIER TO GET ON TO EYE PHONES, PARTICULARLY WITH THE SC EARLIER\nTHIS YEAR. >> WE HAD THE FORD ROLLOVER\nCRISIS, A WHILE BACK. THE GM IGNITION ISSUE, WE HAD\nCOMPANIES THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH CRISIS MODES THAT HAVE COME BACK\nJUST FINE. IT IS IN THE MEDIA.\nIT IS TERRIBLE. AND THEN KIND OF PASSES OUT OF\nTHE PUBLIC CONSCIOUSNESS. DO YOU BELIEVE THIS WILL HAPPEN\nWITH SAMSUNG? IS THEIR BRAND STRONG ENOUGH?\n>> IT IS PROBABLY A TOP TEN GLOBAL BRAND AND THEY'RE VERY\nDIVERSIFIED SET OF PRODUCTS FROM, YOU KNOW, TVs TO PHONES\nTO, OF COURSE, SEMICONDUCTOR AND DISPLAYS.\nWE'RE TALKING 20 MILLION UNITS A YEAR, 15 MILLION, 20 MILLION\nUNITS A YEAR. THIS IS NOT A HUGE PIECE OF\nTHEIR BUSINESS. BRAND IS IMPORTANT IN THIS\nMARKET. AND IN SOME OTHER REGIONS IT IS\nMORE IMPORTANT THAN OTHERS. SO I THINK IT IS SOMETHING THAT\nTHEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CORRECT, BUT THEY HAVE A PRETTY\nBROAD PORTFOLIO AND THIS IS, YOU KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT\nHAPPENED, PRETTY RARE THAT IT HAPPENS ON THIS TYPE OF SCALE,\nBUT THEY ARE TAKING ACTION AND THEY'LL JUST HAVE TO FIX THE\nPROBLEMS AND COME BACK. THEY INVENTED THIS LARGE SCREEN\nSMARTPHONE SO THEY WERE THE FIRST ONES TO COME OUT WITH IT.\nAPPLE CAUGHT UP REALLY WELL IN THE LAST TWO YEARS.\n>> TIM, THANKS A LOT. TIM LONG.\n>> ANOTHER BIG PART OF SAMSUNG'S GALAXY 7 NIGHTMARE IS HOW THE\nCOMPANY'S MANAGEMENT IS HANDLING THE CRISIS.\nOR MAYBE NOT HANDLING THE CRISIS.\nLET'S BRING IN NOW VIVEC AND JOHN.\nI UNDERSTAND YOU JUST RECENTLY IN THE LAST COUPLE OF HOURS HAVE\nSPOKEN WITH SOMEONE FAIRLY UP HIGH IN THE FOOD CHAIN AT\nSAMSUNG. HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THEIR\nREACTION TO THIS AND THE MOOD OF THE PERSON THAT YOU SPOKE WITH?\n>> THEY ARE REALLY, REALLY IN CRISIS MODE.\nALL OVER. TOLD ME THE EXECUTIVE TEAM IS\nGETTING HOURLY UPDATES, SO TAKING IT VERY SERIOUSLY.\nTHEY KNOW THEY MESSED UP. THEY KNOW THEY HAVE A DISASTER\nON THEIR HANDS. ON THE OTHER HAND, THEY, YOU\nKNOW, THIS IS A SMALL PART OF THE BUSINESS, THE COMPANY IS\nDOING OVERALL WELL, BUT ALL OVER THIS.\nAND MY ADVICE TO THEM WAS TO DECLARE DEFEAT WITH THE NOTE,\nREBRAND IT AND ANNOUNCE A NEW PRODUCT LINEUP THAT BLOWS PEOPLE\nAWAY. >> I DON'T KNOW -- I THINK IT\nMIGHT BE GOING TOO FAR TO SAY THIS ISN'T A DISASTER FOR THEM.\nMAINLY BECAUSE OF WHAT WAS JUST MENTIONED, THE FACT THAT GOOGLE\nHAS A PHONE COMING OUT, SECURITY EXPERTS I TALKED TO SAY ANDROID\nOVERALL TENDS TO HAVE A PROBLEM. BUT IF YOU GET AN ANDROID PHONE\nAND DON'T WANT SECURITY ISSUES, GO WITH SAMSUNG OR GOOGLE\nBECAUSE THEY'RE ABLE TO PUSH OUT THESE UPDATES MORE OFTEN.\nAND THOSE ARE KEY TO SECURITY. IF YOU TAKE SAMSUNG OUT OF THE\nPICTURE, THEN A LOT OF PEOPLE GO TO GOOGLE.\nTHERE IS THE FRUSTRATION ISSUE. THIS ISN'T AS IF IT IS JUST ONE\nCALL OF A MILLION UNITS. WE WENT THROUGH THAT ALREADY.\nTHIS IS REPLACEMENT UNITS HAVING AN ISSUE.\nSEVERAL PEOPLE I KNOW ARE SAMSUNG LOYALISTS FOUND THE\nINITIAL REPLACEMENT PROCESS FRUSTRATING.\nTHEY'RE NOT WILLING TO GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN.\nNOW SAMSUNG IS HAVING TO TRY TO HOLD ON TO PEOPLE WHO AREN'T\nABLE TO GET THE SIZE, THE QUALITY PHONE THEY WANTED TO\nBEGIN WITH. SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE, YOU KNOW,\nARE WILLING TO CONSIDER APPLE AT THIS STAGE.\nAT A STAPLE WHERE SAMSUNG NEEDS TO BE PICKING UP SHARE.\n>> EVEN THOUGH IT MAY BE -- IT IS NOT GOING TO BE DETRIMENTAL\nOVERALL IN TERMS OF THE PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE, STILL\nPHONES OCCUPYING INCREDIBLE MIND SHARE IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW.\nWE'RE ON THEM ALL THE TIME. YOU BUMP INTO PEOPLE, WALKING\nDOWN THE STREET, SO REGARDLESS OF WHAT IT REPRESENTS ON THE\nBALANCE SHEET, IT IS A VERY BIG PRODUCT.\nCOULD IT SPILL OVER TO OTHER STUFF THAT SAMSUNG MAKES THAT\nPEOPLE MAY NOT BUY AS A RESULT OF THIS?\n>> NO, I DON'T THINK SO. BUT YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THAT\nSAMSUNG IS GETTING AMAZING  NOW YOU CAN -- YOU HEAR ABOUT\nSAMSUNG THREE OR FOUR TIMES. PEOPLE ARE BEING HAMMERED WITH\nSAMSUNG, SAMSUNG, SAMSUNG. >> YOU THINK PEOPLE ARE MORE\nLIKELY TO BUY BECAUSE OF THIS? >> NOT THIS VERSION.\nTHIS YOU HAVE TO ABANDON. BUT SAMSUNG HAS BECOME A\nHOUSEHOLD NAME. THIS IS THE WAY IT GOES IN\nMARKETING, YOU CAN TAKE A DISASTER AND TURN IT INTO A\nVICTORY IF YOU DO THINGS RIGHT. WILL SAMSUNG DO IT?\nI DON'T KNOW IF THEIR MANAGEMENT TEAM IS SMART ENOUGH TO DO IT\nBUT THEY MAY GET THERE. THEY'RE NOT GOOD AT HYPE AND PR\nMANAGEMENT, BUT VERY COMPETENT AT TECHNOLOGY AND THEY ARE\nLISTENING VERY CAREFULLY TO THE MARKET RIGHT NOW.\n>> THOSE PICTURES LOOK LIKE OVERCOOKED KALE CHIPS, YOU KNOW?\nOF THE PHONE THERE THAT HAVE MELTED.\nI HAVE A SAMSUNG 7 GALAXY. IT GETS WARM.\nI HAVE TO CONFESS, I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IT.\nDO THEY GET BACK IN THE GAME WITH A NEW VERSION OF THIS\nLARGER SIZE 7, THE NOTE, REBRAND IT, RENAMED, AND DO THEY HAVE TO\nCUT PRICES DRAMATICALLY TO RETAIN MARKET SHARE?\nIS THAT ONE OF THEIR RESPONSES? >> YEAH, I THINK THAT'S WHAT\nTHEY NEED TO DO, TO RETHINK WHAT THEY ARE, THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL\nPRODUCT. I TELL YOU, WHEN I USE THIS, AND\nGO BACK TO THE iPHONE, IT IS LIKE GOING BACK TO AN iPHONE 3\nOR 4. THE iPHONE LOOKS SO INFERIOR.\nTHE GOOGLE PHONE MAY WELL BE BETTER, SO THAT MIGHT BE THE\nREAL RISK TO SAMSUNG IS GOOGLE, NOT APPLE.\nTHE FACT IS THEY HAVE TO DO SOMETHING DRAMATIC AFTER THIS TO\nRECOVER. AND IF THEY DO IT RIGHT, THEN\nTHEY WIN. IF NOT, THEY BASICALLY GO THE\nWAY OF SOME OF -- MOTOROLA AND A BUNCH OF OTHER BRANDS LIKE THAT.\n>> THEY MISSED THE WINDOW IS THE ISSUE.\nWE'RE NOW APPROACHING MID-OCTOBER, Q 4 HOLIDAY SEASON\nIS HUGE. THEY THE REASON WHY THEY\nRELEASED THIS PHONE AT THE TIME THEY DID IS TO GO HEAD TO HEAD\nWITH THE iPHONE 7 AND 7 PLUS. NOW THEY'RE GOING TO MISS THAT.\nTHERE IS THAT PREMIUM TIER WHERE THE MONEY IS MADE, THAT'S WHAT\nTHIS PHONE IS BUILT TO DO, MAKE A LOT OF MONEY.\nTHAT PROFIT IS NOW SERIOUSLY IN JEOPARDY.\n>> GOOD POINT. THANKS, GUYS.\nREMIND ME WHEN YOU'RE FLYING NEXT SO I --\n>> IS IT ON YOU? >> I'LL GO GET IT.\n>> WE FIGURED OUT WHY THIS PHONE, THE BATTERIES ARE VERY\nSIMILAR, RIGHT? AREN'T THEY ALL SIMILAR?\nWHY THIS PHONE? >> SEE IF IT IS WARM.\n>> THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY.\nSTOCKS IN TODAY'S TRADING, PLUS, THE SMALL CAP CALL OF THE DAY,\nUP 200% THIS YEAR. WHY IT COULD STILL DOUBLE RALLY\nDOUBLE DIGITS FROM HERE. BEING CALLED THE SINGLE BEST\nIDEA IN THE CONSUMER SPACE RIGHT NOW.\nTHAT NAME WHEN WE COME BACK.",

THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO RESTART\nPRODUCTION AND SUDDENLY THERE'S AN ISSUE HERE WITH REGARDS TO\nWHAT ABOUT A THIRD ITERATION THAT COMES INTO THE MARKET.\nTHERE'S IMPLICATIONS FOR THE COMPANY ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES.\nFIRSTLY THE FINANCIAL IMPLICATION.\nAND THE FINANCIAL IMPACT, IF YOU THINK ROUGHLY 2.5 MILLION PHONES\nWERE SHIPPED ORIGINALLY IN THE FIRST RECALL, MOST ESTIMATES WE\nSUSPECT AROUND 4.5 MILLION OF THE NOTE 7 WERE EXPECTED IN THE\nKEY CRITICAL Q4 SELLING SEASON AS WELL.\nSO WE'RE TALKING 7 MILLION UNITS.\nTHE FINANCIAL COSTS, IF YOU THINK WE PROBABLY ESTIMATE $300\nMATERIAL PER DEVICE. SO $2.1 MILLION WRITE OFF HAS TO\nBE REFLECTED. THE OTHER ISSUE IS IT'S\nESSENTIAL FOR SAMSUNG TO LIMIT REPUTATIONAL RISK AND NOT AFFECT\nOTHER PRODUCTS. SAMSUNG, FOR THE NOTE IS SAY 4.5\nMILLION ESTIMATES FOR THIS INQUIRY BEFORE THIS ISSUE.\nIF WE GO BACK TO Q2 SAMSUNG HAS H THE NUMBER ONE GLOBAL SHARE.\nTHEY HAD 22% OF THAT MARKET. THEY SHIPPED 77 MILLION\nSMARTPHONES IN Q2. SO ITS ESSENTIAL FOR SAMSUNG TO\nLIMIT. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WALKING\nUS THROUGH THE NUMBERS. YOU TALK ABOUT THE KNOCK ON\nEFFECTS. WHAT'S THE RISK THAT ANDROID\nUSERS WILL SIMPLY TURN OVER TO THE APPLE OPERATING SYSTEM, THE\nIOS SYSTEM WHERE CREDIT SUISSE POINTS OUT LOYALTY RATES ARE\n95%. >> SURE.\nI THINK, AGAIN, IT RAISES A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND ONE OF\nTHOSE WILL BE THE INCOME IN THE WEST WE THINK COULD BE A SLIGHT\nADVANTAGE TO APPLE GIVEN THE ISSUE THAT SAMSUNG FACES BUT\nALSO I THINK WE'RE PERHAPS RISK OF IGNORING THE GREATER THREAT\nWHICH IF YOU LOOK TO THE CHINESE INDUSTRY GROWING THEIR MARKET\nSHARE AGGRESSIVELY. THEY COULD BE THE BIGGEST\nGAINERS FROM THIS. ALLWAY LOOKS TO BE NUMBER ONE IN\nSMARTPHONES. IT'S THE CHINESE VENDORS THAT\nWILL BENEFIT THE MOST. YET THERE'S POTENTIAL FOR APPLE\nTO ENJOY A BETTER COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE WESTERN MARKETS.\n>> NEIL, GOOD MORNING. I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER WHETHER\nWE'VE SEEN A RECALL OF THIS MAGNITUDE FROM A SUPPLIER LIKE\nTHIS AND IF WE HAVEN'T HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT WILL TAKE BEFORE\nSAMSUNG STARTS TO REGAIN TRUST FROM CUSTOMERS THAT THEIR\nDEVICES ARE OKAY OR WILL THEY LOSE TRUST THAT PEOPLE WILL BE\nBUYING OTHER ITEMS FROM SAMSUNG, BUT JUST TAKE NOTE OF THIS\nPARTICULAR RECALL? >> SO, IT'S IMPORTANT NOW FOR\nSAMSUNG TO GET OUT THE MESSAGE IN TWO THINGS HERE.\nTHE FIRST RECALL FELT VERY MUCH LIKE A VERY RUSHED SITUATION IN\nTERMS OF SWITCHING BATTERY SUPPLIES, FOR EXAMPLE.\nWHAT WE NOW KNOW OR SEEMS THE EVIDENCE POINTS TO THE FACT THE\nDESIGN ITSELF MAY HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE.\nSO THE BATTERY IS TIGHTLY PACKED INTO THE PACKAGE.\nSO SAMSUNG REALLY HAS TO ENSURE THAT IF THEY ARE GOING TO\nCONTINUE THIS PRODUCT WHICH I THINK IS QUESTIONABLE BUT IF\nTHEY DO TO ENSURE THAT THEY REGAIN TRUST BY BEING EXPLICIT\nTO CONSUMERS IN THE MESSAGE THAT THE SITUATION, THE ISSUES THEY\nHAD ARE IN THE PAST. BUT SECONDLY AND MOST\nIMPORTANTLY, TO GET ACROSS THE MESSAGES PURELY TO THE DESIGN OF\nONE PARTICULAR PRODUCT AND NOT OTHER SAMSUNG PRODUCTS OF WHICH\nTHEY'VE ENJOYED TREMENDOUS GROWTH IN THE PAST.\nTHEY NEED TO MAKE A VERY CLEAR LINE AROUND THIS ONE PRODUCT TO\nPREVENT THE BRAND RISK TO OTHER PRODUCTS.\n>> NEIL, GOOD SEEING YOU THIS MORNING.\nTHANK YOU VERY MUCH.",

TWITTER IS A MECHANISM TO GET\nINFORMATION. I'M NOT SAYING I COULD FIX\nTWITTER BECAUSE I CAN'T. I CAN'T BELIEVE THE FIX OF\nTWITTER IS ALL THAT COMPLICATED. YES, THE STOCK HAS BEEN\nDIFFICULT OVER THE LAST WEEK OR SO BUT YOU SAW WHEN THERE WAS\nJUST A GLIMPER OF INTEREST THE WEEK BEFORE HOW QUICKLY THE\nSTOCK CAN GO HIGHER.

LOOK AT THE NUMBERS THAT OUR NEW\nPOLL CONDUCTED OVER THE WEEKEND BEFORE THE DEBATE BUT AFTER THE\nREVELATION OF THOSE LEWD COMMENTS ON TAPE FROM 2005.\nWE SHOW THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS DOUBLED HER LEAD OVER DONALD\nTRUMP IN A FOUR-WAY RACE IT WAS SIX POINTS IN SEPTEMBER.\nNOW IT IS 11. IN A TWO-WAY RACE IT WAS SEVEN\nPOINTS IN SEPTEMBER. NOW IT IS 14.\nAND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE RACE FOR CONGRESS WE SEE THAT THE\nDEMOCRATS ADVANTAGE OVER THE REPUBLICANS HAS ALSO DOUBLED TO\nSEVEN POINTS AND THAT IS WHY PAUL RYAN ON A CONFERENCE CALL\nSAID HE IS NOT GOING TO DEFEND DONALD TRUMP ANYMORE.\nHE IS GOING TO LET EVERY MEMBER FEND FOR THEMSELVES AS PEOPLE\nDID OVER THE WEEKEND AND MORE AND MORE REPUDIATING DONALD\nTRUMP, MANY CALLING FOR HIM TO QUIT THE RACE.\nDONALD TRUMP RESPONDED SHARPLY TO PAUL RYAN ON A TWEET SAYING\nOUGHT TO FOCUS ON THINGS LIKE THE BUDGET.\nGUYS, WHAT WE HAVE IS A REPUBLICAN PARTY IN A CIVIL WAR\nAND WE DON'T KNOW HOW THAT WILL GO.\nPAUL RYAN IS CLEARLY ASSERTING THAT HE IS GOING TO PAY\nATTENTION TO HIS PART OF THE PARTY.\nAND DONALD TRUMP IS PAYING ATTENTION TO HIS PART AND I\nDON'T KNOW HOW THE STORY WILL END.\n>> IT IS FASCINATING EVERY DECLARATION ON HOW THE RACE SET\nUP AND IT SWUNG UP.

ACTUALLY, WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE\nGENERAL ELECTION IT IS NOT A VOLATILE RACE.\nTHERE HAVE BEEN TIMES THE LEAD WAS SMALLER AND TIMES IT IS\nBIGGER BUT DONALD TRUMP HAS NOT LED THE RACE IN ANY CONSISTENT\nWAY EXCEPT FOR A COUPLE OF OUTLIAR POLLS.\nTHE CLOSER YOU GET TO THE ELECTION THE MORE ATTITUDES GET\nFIXED BY BOTH NOMINEES. TRUMP IS MORE UNPOPULAR.\n60% MAJORITY SAY THEY DON'T THINK HE HAS THE TEMPERAMENT TO\nBE PRESIDENT. NOTHING THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS\nDONE OVER THE LAST WEEK OR THAT HAS COME OUT ABOUT DONALD TRUMP\nIS GOING TO CHANGE THAT OPINION. SO THE MARGIN COULD VARY AND\nWHEN YOU POLL IN THE MIDDLE OF A NEWS EVENT LIKE THOSE LEAKED\nTAPES YOU MAGNIFY THE IMPACT OF IT.\nI WOULD EXPECT THE MARGIN TO COME DOWN.\nIT IS AT THIS MOMENT DANGEROUSLY LARGE FOR REPUBLICANS NOT ONLY\nFOR THE HOPES OF THE PRESIDENCY BUT ALSO FOR HOLDING THE HOUSE\nAS WELL AS THE SENATE. >> ANY INSIGHTS ON STATES THAT\nMIGHT BE IN PLAY PERHAPS LEADING TO DEMOCRATIC SIDE THAT WERE NOT\nPREVIOUSLY DAYS OR WEEKS AGO? >> HERE IS AN EXAMPLE.\nHILLARY CLINTON GOING INTO HIS WEEKEND EVEN BEFORE THE TAPE\nOCCURRED WAS LEADING IN 12 OF THE 14 BATTLE GROUND STATES THAT\nREAL CLEAR POLITICS TAKES A LOOK AT.\nIF SHE OPENS UP A LEAD IN THE RANGE OF TEN POINTS WHICH SHE\nSHOWED IN OUR POLL SHE WILL WIN ALL BATTLE GROUND STATES AND A\nCOUPLE THAT AREN'T CONSIDERED TOP FLIGHT BATTLE GROUNDS LIKE\nARIZONA AND GEORGIA. IT'S NOT INCONCEIVABLE SHE WINS\nBY 14 POINTS AS WE SHOWED IN THE TWO-WAY MATCHUP SHE COULD CARRY\nMISSOURI. I'M SAYING IF THAT MARGIN STAYS\nAROUND DOUBLE DIGITS THEN ALL BETS ARE OFF AND SHE COULD RUN\nTHE TABLE OF BATTLE GROUND STATES.\n>> JOHN HARWOOD STILL IN ST.

WHAT SHOULD WE BE NOTICING FROM\nWHAT WE SAW DURING THE COURSE OF THE WEEKEND?\n>> LET ME START BY SAYING MY PARTNER AND HIS TEAM DID A\nFABULOUS JOB ON THIS, ALONG WITH THE TEAM AT HART RESEARCH.\nWHAT IT COMES OUT IS DONALD TRUMP HAD A TERRIBLE PERIOD, AND\nNOW, IT IS REALLY HIT BOTTOM. HE HAS ONLY GOT 29% OF THE\nAMERICAN PUBLIC SAYING THEY HAVE FAVORABLE VIEWS OF HIM.\nHE ONLY HAS -- HE HAS LOST THE MAJORITY OF THE COLLEGE EDUCATED\nWHITE MALE AND THAT'S A VOTE HE HAS TO HAVE.\n>> I THINK MITT ROMNEY WON BY 14 POINTS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.\n>> YOU GOT IT EXACTLY RIGHT. THAT'S THE WHOLE PROBLEM.\nALL DAY, ALL THE KEYS, ARE JUST DROPPING OUT.\nAND THE POINT IS, HILLARY'S NUMBERS ARE GOING UP, AND SHE\nHAS HAD HER HIGHEST NUMBERS SINCE JANUARY.\nSO BOTH OF THOSE THINGS ARE WORKING TOGETHER.\nAS YOU SAID, QUICK POLL, OVERNIGHT.\nSO WE'LL WAIT AND SEE UNTIL TOMORROW, AND LATER IN THE WEEK.\nBUT WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO IS ESSENTIALLY WHO IS GOING TO\nSTICK WITH HIM, AND FOR THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESSIONAL GROUP,\nTHOSE WHO SPLIT ARE IN A TERRIBLE PLACE, BECAUSE THE\nREPUBLICAN VOTERS ARE STILL WITH TRUMP.\nSO WHERE DO YOU GO. >> AS YOUR COLLEAGUE TOLD US, HE\nIS IN A WEAKER POSITION THAN THE SEPTEMBER TRACK.\nIT ALSO DOES NOT MEAN HE CAN'T GET THESE POINTS BACK.\nLET ME PUT UP THE FOUR-WAY RACE RIGHT NOW, THAT INCLUDES THE LIBERTARIAN AND GREEN PARTY,\nGARY JOHNSON AT 9, AND JILL STEIN AT TWO POINTS.\nTHEY'VE NOT BENEFITED BY NOT BEING ON THE DEBATE STAGE, WHICH\nHAS HAUNTED THEM. THE 35% NUMBER FOR DONALD TRUMP\nIS STRIKING. EVERYONE THOUGHT IT WON'T TAKE\n50% TO WIN THE 270 ELECTORAL VOTES NEEDED, BUT THE 35% IS\nSTRIKING. >> IT IS TERRIBLE.\nBECAUSE ESSENTIALLY, YOU CAN'T GO LOWER THAN 35%.\nI MEAN, WHEN YOU LOOK AT WIPEOUT RACES, WE TALK ABOUT GETTING\n40%. AND OBVIOUSLY, YOU HAVE A\nCANDIDATE, BUT DONALD TRUMP NEEDS TO BE AT 42 TO 45%.\nHE IS WAY BELOW THAT. HILLARY CLINTON HAS IMPROVED HER\nSTANDING, AND NOT ONLY WITH WOMEN AND SHE HAS A HUGE LEAD\nTHERE, BUT ALSO WITH MEN. >> TO BE CLEAR, WE'RE IN THE\nFIELD RIGHT NOW, GETTING MORE REACTION IN THE AFTERMATH OF\nLAST NIGHT'S DEBATE. PETER, NICE TO SEE YOU.\n>> THANK YOU.",

I'M BRIT HUME AND THIS IS \"ON\nTHE RECORD.\" TONIGHT THERE IS TALK DONALD\nTRUMP'S PERFORMANCE AT THE DEBATE MAY HAVE SAVED HIS\nCANDIDACY AT LEAST FOR NOW. TRUMP IS HOPING THE FUROR OVER\nTHE 2005 VIDEO MAY BEGIN TO SUBSIDE.\nTHERE ARE ALSO SOME NEW HILLARY CLINTON E-MAILS OUT TONIGHT AND\nWE'LL HAVE A REPORT ON THEM. AT THIS HOUR THE NATIONAL\nPOLLING AVERAGE SHOWS HILLARY CLINTON WITH JUST UNDER A\nSIX-POINT LEAD IN A TWO-WAY RACE AND JUST OVER A FIVE-POINT LEAD.\nTHE BETTING ODDS CONTINUE TO SHOW HER A FAVORITE BY NOW\nNEARLY 5-1. MEANWHILE THERE IS A NEW\nNATIONAL POLL OUT TODAY AND IT IS THE FIRST MAJOR POLL TAKEN\nAFTER THE RELEASE OF THAT 2005 TRUMP VIDEO.\nIN THAT NBC NEWS/\"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" SURVEY CLINTON HAS A\n14-POINT LEAD IN A TWO-WAY RACE AND AN 11-POINT LEAD IN A\nFOUR-WAY. THIS WAS TAKEN BEFORE LAST\nNIGHT'S DEBATE. HERE IS THE BIG QUESTION, DID\nDONALD TRUMP DO ENOUGH TO STOP THE WEEKEND BLEEDING AND BEGIN\nTO RECOVER LOST GROUND? SCOTT JENNINGS IS HERE.\nHE DID POLITICAL ANALYSIS FOR THE GEORGE W. BUSH WHITE HOUSE,\nJOINS US FROM KENTUCKY. SCOTT, YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHETHER\nTRUMP DID HIMSELF ENOUGH GOOD TO BOUNCE BACK.\n>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. IN THIS SURVEY HE WAS DOWN TO\n72% OF REPUBLICANS. SO WE'RE BACK WHERE WE WERE OVER\nTHE SUMMER, BRIT, WITH DONALD TRUMP NEEDING TO DO BASE\nCONSOLIDATION. IT WAS FINE THEN BECAUSE HE HAD\nA LOT OF TIME. WE'RE LATE IN THE GAME AND RIGHT\nNOW HE'S REHERDING HIS OWN SHEEP.\nA POLL THAT COMES OUT LATER THIS WEEK IF HE DID ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN\nTO REPUBLICANS AND APOLOGIZE TO REPUBLICANS AND BRING THEM BACK\nONBOARD. I'M DUBIOUS HE WOULD GET THAT\nLOW OF A NUMBER ON ELECTION DAY AMONG HIS OWN PARTY.\nMY SUSPICION IS ONCE THE NUMBER GOES BACK UP INTO THE 80s YOU'LL\nSEE RETIGHTENING IN THE NATIONAL SURVEYS.\n>> I'M THINKING ABOUT MITT ROMNEY BACK FOUR YEARS AGO.\nHE GOT ON ELECTION DAY, WHAT, 93% OF THE REPUBLICAN VOTE, SO\nIT WOULD APPEAR AT LEAST AS WE LOOK OUT FROM THIS MOMENT,\nSCOTT, THAT MR. TRUMP HAS A LOT OF GROUND TO MAKE UP EVEN AMONG\nREPUBLICANS. >> HE REALLY DOES AND WE SHOULD\nCAUTION THIS POLL WAS TAKEN AS THE VIDEO WAS BEING RELEASED.\nA SMALLER SAMPLE AND IT COULD BE AN OUTLIER AND THAT'S WHY IT'S\nWISE TO WAIT AND SEE WHAT OTHER DATA YOU GET AFTER A FEW DAYS GO\nBY. I DO THINK REPUBLICANS LARGELY\nACCEPTED HIS PERFORMANCE LAST NIGHT, AND SO WE SHOULD BEGIN TO\nSEE IT BOUNCE BACK. AS YOU SAY, WE HAVE A LONG WAY\nTO GO TO GET BACK UP TO THE 90%. IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE SOMEONE\nWINNING THE PRESIDENCY WITHOUT 90% OF THEIR OWN PARTY.\nHE HAS A LOT OF GROUND TO MAKE UP.\nMY SUSPICION IS IT DID AMONG SOME REPUBLICANS BUT I'M NOT\nSURE AGAINST OTHER CONSTITUENTS HE WOULD NEED TO PUT HIM OVER\nTHE HUMP. >> THAT'S RIGHT.\nTHAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE\nSUBURBAN MOMS, EDUCATED WHITE WOMEN, AND THE SUBURBS AROUND\nPHILADELPHIA THAT HAVE BECOME A SORT OF SYMBOL OF WHAT A\nREPUBLICAN NEEDS TO DO BETTER THAN REPUBLICANS HAVE DONE IN\nRECENT CYCLES. AS YOU WATCHED THE DEBATE LAST\nNIGHT, SCOTT, WHAT WERE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT WHETHER THOSE\nCONSTITUENCIES AND OTHERS LIKE THEM MIGHT RESPOND TO HIS\nPERFORMANCE? >> WELL, MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS\nTHAT HIS STRATEGY WAS TO KEEP THE BASE TOGETHER.\nTHERE'S ABOUT 40% OF THE COUNTRY THAT SEES IT THE WAY DONALD\nTRUMP SEES IT. THEY WOULD NEVER VOTE FOR\nHILLARY CLINTON UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, AND SOME PEOPLE\nACTUALLY DO SHARE HIS WORLD VIEW AND HIS POLICY VIEW.\nTHAT MAKES UP ABOUT 40%. THAT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH TO WIN.\nHE'S GOTTEN UP TO ALMOST A TIE WITH HILLARY CLINTON AT SOME\nPOINTS IN THE CAMPAIGN. RIGHT NOW HE'S NOT TIED.\nRIGHT NOW HE'S LOSING. SO LAST NIGHT WAS ABOUT TRYING\nTO GET THAT BASE BACK TOGETHER THAT GETS WITHIN SHOUTING\nDISTANCE OF A TIE BUT, BOY, TIME IS RUNNING OUT.\nWE ALREADY HAVE EARLY VOTING GOING ON IN SOME STATES.\nPEOPLE ARE CASTING THEIR BALLOTS AND MAKING UP THEIR MIND.\nIF HE HAS TO SPEND THE NEXT MONTH GETTING BACK TO WHERE HE\nWAS, THAT'S NO RECIPE FOR WINNING.\nIT'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME.\n>> VIEWERSHIP WAS OFF FROM THE FIRST DEBATE.\nHE WAS OBVIOUSLY SPEAKING TO A SMALLER AUDIENCE.\nHARD TO KNOW WHETHER HE'LL HAVE AN EVEN SMALLER AUDIENCE FOR THE\nTHIRD DEBATE WHICH OUR CHRIS WALLACE IS MODERATING.\nWE'RE ALL LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT FOR OBVIOUS REASONS.\nWHAT HE MIGHT TRY TO DO THEN? >> WELL, AT THIS POINT IF THE\nPOLL NUMBERS ARE STAYING THE SAME, SHOWING HIM LOSING THE\nRACE, HE'LL LITERALLY HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE AT THE THIRD\nDEBATE. HE'LL PROBABLY CONTINUE TO GO\nFOR BROKE ON ATTACKING THE CLINTONS AND THEIR PAST SEXUAL\nSCANDALS. THEY CLEARLY THINK THAT'S A\nTICKET TO WIN THIS RACE. I'M NOT SURE THAT IT IS.\nTHE POLLING DOESN'T NECESSARILY BACK THAT UP, BUT THEY BELIEVE\nTHAT IT IS. IT'S A TICKET TO TRY TO HOLD A\nLOT OF THE REPUBLICAN BASE TOGETHER.\nTHE REPUBLICANS DON'T LIKE THE CLINTONS, OF COURSE.\nGETTING OVER THE HUMP, WE'VE NEVER SEEN TRUMP GET OVER THE\nHUMP. JUST FOCUSING ON THIS 40% OF THE\nCOUNTRY THAT LOVES WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW IS NOT\nGOING TO BE ENOUGH TO WIN. SO AT THE THIRD DEBATE HE WOULD\nTRY TO PROBABLY GO FOR BROKE ON THE CLINTONS AND THEN MAYBE COME\nUP WITH SOME KIND OF POLICY DISCUSSION THAT WOULD ATTRACT\nNEW PEOPLE. BUT THAT IS QUITE A HAIL MARY\nSCENARIO TO BE THROWING AT THE END OF A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN\nLIKE THIS ONE. >> IT CERTAINLY IS, SCOTT.\nTHANK YOU VERY MUCH. TODAY AS MANY PEOPLE NOW KNOW,\nHOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN TOLD REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS IN A\nMORNING CONFERENCE CALL HE WILL NO LONGER CAMPAIGN WITH TRUMP.\nINSTEAD HE WILL USE THE NEXT 28 DAYS TO TRY TO KEEP HIS PARTY IN\nCONTROL OF THE HOUSE. MR. TRUMP REACTED ON TWITTER AS\nFOLLOWS. PAUL RYAN SHOULD SPEND MORE TIME\nON BALANCING THE BUDGET, JOBS, AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND NOT\nWASTE HIS TIME ON FIGHTING THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE.\nOUR NIGHTLY POLITICAL PANEL HERE, FRED BARNES, EBBS HE CAN\nTIFF EDITOR OF THE WEEKLY STANDARD AND MELISSA HEMINGWAY.\nFRED, WHAT ABOUT RYAN SAID TODAY?\nWAS THIS A WISE MOVE, A SIGNAL TO HIS CHARGES IN THE HOUSE OF\nREPRESENTATIVES AS TO HOW THEY",

ABSOLUTELY.\nIF TRUMP REALLY DOES WANT TO BE PRESIDENT WITH A REPUBLICAN\nHOUSE AND REPUBLICAN SENATE TO BACK HIM, HE OUGHT TO LOSE THE\nTWITTER FEED ON THOSE KIND OF ISSUES AND INSTEAD SAY, WASN'T A\nREPUBLICAN HOUSE AND REPUBLICAN SENATE TO HELP ME ACHIEVE MY\nGOAL ON BEHALF OF AMERICA. OTHERWISE, HE WILL MATERIALLY\nHURT THEIR EFFORTS AND HURT HIS OWN AS A RESULT.\nREPUBLICANS DON'T NEED A CIVIL WAR.\nEVEN IF IT'S A MINOR ONE BETWEEN NOW AND ELECTION DAY.\n>> ARE DEMOCRATS THINKING AS YOU LOOK AT THE BALANCE OF POWER IN\nTHE SENATE, IT'S CLOSER. THEY LOOK LIKE THEY ARE POISED\nTO PICK UP MAJORITY IN THE SENATE AND THERE YOU SEE 54/46,\n44 DEMOCRATS AND TWO INDEPENDENT WITH THE DEMOCRATS.\nAND THEN IN THE HOUSE, IT'S A WIDER SPREAD.\nBUT ISN'T THERE HOPE ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE OF POSSIBLY EVEN\nSWINGING AN ELECTION IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES?\n>> I THINK THAT'S WISHFUL THINKING.\nI THINK THERE'S A LOT OF HOPE THAT THAT COULD HAPPEN.\nCERTAINLY, SOME PIECES ARE FALLING INTO PLACE THAT MIGHT\nMAKE IT A VAGUE POSSIBILITY. >> HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGNED\nIN -- FOR A RACE TODAY. THEY DIDN'T THINK SHE WAS GOING\nTO CAMPAIGN WITH. THAT'S A CLOSE RACE, A HOUSE\nRACE. >> I THINK TWO THINGS.\nONE, I THINK THE SENATE IS DEFINITELY IN PLAY.\nI THINK THE MARGIN THAT HILLARY HAS RIGHT NOW IS LIKELY TO PULL\nIN A SENATE MAJORITY.  CASE.\nTHERE'S SO MANY SEATS THAT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE.\nCERTAINLY, DEMOCRATS CERTAINLY BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO\nBETTER THAN WE COULD HAVE EXPECTED.\nBUT I DON'T THINK THERE'S -- I THINK THINKING ABOUT A MAJORITY\nTHAT STILL ISN'T THERE. ON THE OTHER HAND, WHAT RYAN DID\nTODAY REALLY IS GOING TO CAUSE PROBLEMS OUT THERE.\nBECAUSE IF YOU WITHDRAW YOUR SUPPORT OR DON'T CAMPAIGN WITH\nTRUMP AND YOUR REPUBLICAN TURNOUT DEPRESSES BECAUSE OF\nTHAT, AS THE ESTABLISHMENT PULLS AWAY FROM HIM, THEN -- AND TRUMP\nSUPPORTERS GET ANGRY AT RYAN AND THE ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS,\nYOU HAVE A CIVIL WAR, THE ONE THAT CARL REFERRED TO THAT YOU\nWANT TO AVOID RIGHT NOW. YOU CAN'T HAVE ONE OF THOSE.\nIF THAT STARTS TO BREAK OUT, PEOPLE STAY HOME OR GET MAD,\nTHEN YOU'VE GOT A SITUATION WHERE, YES, DEMOCRATS COULD GET\nTHE MAJORITY IN BOTH. >> LET ME GO QUICKLY TO THE\nELECTORAL MAP. THE PICTURE THAT IS PAINTING\nRIGHT NOW. IT'S STILL AN UPHILL BATTLE FOR\nDONALD TRUMP TO GET TO 270. BOTH OF YOU, QUICKLY, PICK A\nSTATE THAT YOU THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT AND WHY.\nFIRST YOU, CARL. WHAT'S YOUR STATE?\n>> PENNSYLVANIA. >> PENNSYLVANIA.\nLET ME PUT THE POLL UP HERE. CLINTON, 47, TRUMP 39.\n>> LOOK, IF THIS WAS A STATE WHERE HE WAS WITHIN A POINT\nAFTER THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION, HE CLOSED IT AGAIN IN LATE\nSEPTEMBER. IT'S NOW WIDENED OUT SINCE THE\nFIRST DEBATE. THIS IS A STATE HE NEEDS.\nEVEN IF HE TAKES ALL OF THE ROMNEY STATES AND OHIO AND\nFLORIDA AND IOWA AND NEVADA WHERE HE HAS BEEN POLLING WELL,\nTHAT STILL ONLY GETS HIM TO 265. NEEDS SOMETHING THE DEMOCRATS\nHAVE CONSISTENTLY WON. THIS LOOKED LIKE HIS BEST\nOPPORTUNITY. HE PROBABLY THINKS THAT'S WHY SO\nAS WELL. THAT'S WHY HE WENT THERE TODAY.\n>> WHAT'S YOUR STATE, JOE? >> NORTH CAROLINA.\n>> THE 44 FOR CLINTON, 42.2 FOR TRUMP.\n>> THIS IS THE PLACE I SAID BEFORE WHERE TRUMP HAS -- HE HAS\nTO CARRY NORTH CAROLINA. I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT OBAMA\nWON IT BY A HALF A POINT IN 2012.\nSHE'S RUNNING FAR BETTER THAN THAT.\nSOME POLLS HAVE HER UP SIX. I KNOW THE AVERAGE DOESN'T HAVE\nHER THAT MUCH. I ACTUALLY THINK THAT THIS COULD\nBE THE STATE THAT DECIDES HER AND THE SENATE SEAT COULD GO\nWITH HER. >> RICHARD BURR IS TRYING TO\nHOLD ON TO HIS SEAT. JOE AND CARL, THANK YOU AS\nALWAYS.",

STEVE, WHAT WAS HE TRYING TO DO\nTHERE AND DID HE WIN UNDECIDED VOTERS WITH THAT?\n>> CRAIG, POLITICS IS ONE CRAZY BUSINESS.\nIT'S PRETTY VOLATILE. I WAS LOOKING AT THIS VERY\nCAMERA OVER 20 HOURS AGO AND TRYING TO CONVINCE REPORTERS AND\nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE DONALD TRUMP WAS STAYING IN THE RACE AND I\nTHINK WE'VE GOT RENEWED MOMENTUM AND ENTHUSIASM.\nI THINK WHAT HE WAS DOING, TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION\nSPECIFICALLY, I THINK WHAT HE WAS DOING THERE IS TO POINT OUT\nHER UNFITNESS. HER E-MAIL SCANDALS, HER\nSUBTERFUGE, THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\n>> THAT' SAID. HE SAID USE HIS POWER AS\nPRESIDENT TO PUT HER IN JAIL. >> BECAUSE SHE IS VERY LIKELY A\nFELON. >> SHE'S NEVER BEEN CONVICTED OF\nANYTHING, NEVER BEEN CHARGED WITH ANYTHING.\n>> CORRECT, BUT FBI DIRECTOR COMEY LAID OUT A CASE AGAINST\nHER, TO ME, AS DAMNING AS ANY INDICTMENT HE COULD COME UP\nWITH. FOR WHATEVER REASON, I DON'T\nKNOW IF HE'S POLITICIZED, HE DID NOT ACTUALLY RECOMMEND\nINDICTMENT BUT I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW VERY WELL,\n60%, BY THE WAY, SAY SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN INDICTED.\nI'M NOT ALONE AND DONALD TRUMP IS NOT ALONE IN SAYING THERE'S\nSOMETHING EXTREMELY FISHY HERE AND EVEN CRIMINAL.\nA SPECIAL PROSECUTOR DOESN'T MEAN A WITCH HUNT, BUT A SPECIAL\nPROSECUTOR TO SOMEONE NOT POLITICIZED TO TAKE AN\nINDEPENDENT LOOK AT HILLARY CLINTON.\nWE HAVE THAT SYSTEM SET UP FOR A REASON.\n>> OR ARGUE THAT THE FBI DIRECTOR DID THAT.\n>> YOU MIGHT. BUT THAT'S NOT A SPECIAL\nPROSECUTOR. AND THERE'S A REASON WE DO THAT.\nTHERE'S A REASON WE DID IN IRAN CONTRA AND POST-WATERGATE WHY\nSPECIAL PROSECUTORS ARE NEEDED AT TIMES AND I THINK IN THIS\nCASE, IT'S ABSOLUTELY WARRANTED BUT I'M NOT A PROSECUTOR, A\nDEFENSE LAWYER. I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THE\nWEEDS OF THE EXACT STATUTES. I THINK WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT IS\nTHAT SHE WAS RECKLESS WITH THE NATIONAL SECURITY.\nI THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW THAT.\nHAVING A SERVER IN YOUR BASEMENT WHEN YOU'RE THE SECRETARY OF\nSTATE IS THE HEIGHT OF ERROR. >> I'VE GOT TO BE HONEST, AT\nSOME POINT, ANYTIME YOU BRING THAT UP, WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT\nAD NAUSEAM. AND I KNOW IT POLLS WELL WITH\nTHE BASE, BUT WHEN YOU GUYS BRING THAT UP, DOES IT DO\nANYTHING TO REACH A SUBURBAN MOTHER IN PHILADELPHIA, DOES IT\nDO ANYTHING TO REACH THAT UNDECIDED VOTER IN NORTH\nCAROLINA OR FLORIDA AND BY THE WAY, WE SHOULD NOTE THAT\nACCORDING TO ALL MAJOR RECENT POLLS, HE'S TRAILING IN EACH OF\nTHE THREE AFOREMENTIONED STATES. >> RIGHT, THAT'S A GREAT POINT.\nAND I'LL BE CANDID, I DON'T THINK SO, NO.\nI DON'T THINK THAT WILL MOVE THE NEEDLE.\n>> WHY TALKING ABOUT IT? WHY DEVOTE SO MUCH TIME TO THAT?\n>> WELL, BECAUSE, BUT HOLD ON. THERE'S TWO TACKS HERE.\nONE, HE HAS TO PROVE THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS UNFIT TO\nPRESIDENT BUT ALSO LAY OUT HIS VISION FOR PRESIDENT AND ON THAT\nSIDE IS WHERE I BELIEVE HE CAN WIN OVER, YOU KNOW, THAT BUCKS\nCOUNTY MIDDLE AGE MOTHER WHO, RIGHT NOW, IS UNDECIDED OR\nLEANING TOWARDS HILLARY. HOW DO WE WIN THEM OVER?\nTALKING ABOUT ECONOMIC GROWTH, TALKING ABOUT SECURITY.\nWHEN WE TALK THE ECONOMY AND ISIS, I THINK ON THOSE TOPICS,\nON THOSE MACRO ISSUES, THAT'S WHERE WE CAN MOVE THE NEEDLE\nWITH UNDECIDEDS OR PEOPLE SKEPTICAL.\n>> HE PIVOTED TO ISIS WHEN ASKED ABOUT THAT REVELATION OVER THE\nWEEKEND. WHY DOES HE CONTINUE TO DISMISS\nWHAT HE SAID ON THAT TAPE AS LOCKER ROOM TALK?\nWHY DO THAT? >> WELL, YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK\nHE DISMISSED IT AND SHOULDN'T BECAUSE IT'S NOT DISMISSIBLE.\nIT WAS REPUGNANT TALK AND I'VE BEEN CLEAR ABOUT THAT.\nI THINK MOST OF HIS SURROGATES HAS AND HE HAS, MORE\nIMPORTANTLY. HE TOLD THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HE'S\nSORRY, HE'S EMBARRASSED, HE HAD APOLOGIZED TO HIS FAMILY, TO HIS\nWIFE. SO WE TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.\nBY NO MEANS CAN WE JUST BRUSH THAT OFF, BUT WHEN HE\nFORTHRIGHTLY APOLOGIZES TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND SAYS IT'S A\nMISTAKE, I TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD AND ACTIONS.\nHOW DOES HE ACTUALLY TREAT WOMEN?\nOUR CAMPAIGN IS RUN BY A STRONG, INTELLIGENT WOMAN.\nKELLY ANN CONWAY. HIS ORGANIZATION AND POLITICAL\nLIFE IS SOMEONE WHO EMPOWERS WOMEN.\nI RELY AND LEAN ON ACTIONS RATHER THAN A TERRIBLE\nCONVERSATION OVER A DECADE AGO. >> HOW WORRIED ARE YOU THAT\nTHERE'S MORE OUT THERE? >> I'LL BE FRANK.\nIT MAKES ME NERVOUS, SURE. I THINK THERE'S A MACHINE OF\nPRIVATE INVESTIGATORS IN THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN THAT HIRED AND\nTRYING AS MUCH AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN.\n>> ARE YOU PUTTING THAT TAPE ON THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN?\n>> NO. I'M NOT SAYING THAT.\nBUT I AM SAYING THAT THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN AND AFFILIATED WITH THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN SEARCHING FOR\nANY POSSIBLE DIRT AND WHEN YOU DEAL WITH SOMEONE LIKE DONALD\nTRUMP WHO HAS NOT LIVED HIS LIFE IN A SCRIPTED MANNER BY ANY\nSENSE, NOT A PROFESSIONAL POLITICIAN FOR DECADES LIKE\nHILLARY CLINTON. HE LIVED IN A WORLD OF REALITY\nTV WHICH CAN BE PRETTY CRASS. SO ARE THERE POSSIBLY OTHER\nAUDIO TAPES OUT THERE? MAYBE THERE ARE.\nBUT IF WE CAN CATCH HIM FROM A DECADE AGO SAYING SOMETHING\nINAPPROPRIATE, IT'S WHAT IS HIS VISION TO TAKE AMERICA FORWARD\nAND HOW DO WE BREAK OUT OF THE STATUS QUO BECAUSE THAT'S NOT\nOKAY. WE'RE NOT PROSPEROUS AND WE'RE\nNOT SAFE AND I THINK IF WE STICK TO THOSE ISSUES, DONALD TRUMP\nCAN COME BACK AND HE CAN WIN. >> STEVE CORTES, I ALWAYS WISH\nTHAT WE HAD MORE TIME. MAYBE ONE DAY, WE SHOULD INVITE\nYOU ON AND GIVE YOU THE HOUR. >> APPRECIATE IT.\n>> SAFE TRAVELS AS YOU LEAVE ST. LOUIS, SIR.\n>> THANK YOU, SIR.",

I HEARD THAT SIX MONTHS AGO,\nOFFICIALS AT THE FBI WANTED TO APPOINT A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR AND\nBEGIN AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION AND THE OBAMA\nADMINISTRATION SHUT HIM DOWN. >> NBC'S CHIEF LEGAL\nCORRESPONDENT ARI MELBER IS HERE.\nWE WANTED TO SPEND TIME TALKING ABOUT THIS.\nCOULD A PRESIDENT, COULD A UNITED STATES PRESIDENT DIRECT\nTHE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO BRING CHARGES AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON?\n>> NO. THE PRESIDENT CANNOT ORDER A\nSPECIFIC CRIMINAL CHARGE AND WHAT MIKE PENCE JUST SAID THERE\nIS DANGEROUS, ESPECIALLY COMING AFTER DONALD TRUMP'S PLEDGE AT\nTHE DEBATE. MIKE PENCE JUST SAID, 6 MONTHS\nAGO, THE FBI WAS LOOKING AT THIS.\nEXACTLY. NON-PARTISAN INVESTIGATORS AND A\nREPUBLICAN FBI DIRECTOR, BY THE WAY, COMPLETED AND CLOSED THE\nINVESTIGATION. THE NOTION BECAUSE OF A NEW\nPARTY OR ADMINISTRATION IS IN OFFICE, YOU WOULD GO BACK IN AND\nRE-OPEN A CLOSED INVESTIGATION TO INVESTIGATE OR CHARGE YOUR\nPOLITICAL OPPONENTS AND AS DONALD TRUMP SAID LAST NIGHT,\nPUT THEM IN JAIL, IS NOT ONLY VIOLATIVE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND\nPOTENTIALLY AN IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE.\nTHAT WAS ONE OF THE MOST SHOCKING PARTS OF THE DEBATE.\n>> WE SHOULD HAVE HAD THAT NEW PANTS ON FIRE ANIMATION PERHAPS.\n>> BUT THAT'S A SPECIAL ANIMATION ON A SPECIAL BASIS.\n>> THANK YOU, ARI.",

PROBABLY SOME MEMBERS DOWN IN\nFLORIDA. OUT IN THE MIDWEST.\nPROBABLY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THIS AND THINK HARD WHAT EXACTLY\nTHEY SHOULD BE DOING AND SAYING, AS RYAN AND GREG WALDEN,\nCHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN CONGRESSIONAL\nCOMMITTEE SAID TODAY, DO YOUR POLLING.\nFIGURE IT OUT FOR YOURSELVES AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE GOT TO\nDOT WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO DO AND GOT LOOK, VULNERABLE\nREPUBLICANS, LOOK AT THESE NATIONAL POLLS INCLUDING THE\n\"WASHINGTON JOURNAL\" NBC POLL THAT JUST CAME OUT WITHIN THE\nPAST HOUR SHOWING 11-POINT LEAD NATIONALLY RIGHT NOW FOR DONALD\nTRUMP, AND GOING TO SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?\nMAYBE I SHOULD THINK ABOUT MYSELF AND RUN AWAY FROM THIS\nTRAIN? >> ABSOLUTELY.\nTHAT SAME POLL SHOWED DEMOCRATS WITH A SEVEN-POINT EDGE ON THE\nQUESTION WHICH PARTY VOTERS PREFER TO CONTROL CONGRESS WHICH\nIS ACCORDING THAT THEIR STORY THE LARGEST GAP IN FOUR\nDEMOCRATS, LARGEST ADVANTAGE FOR DEMOCRATS, RATHER,\n 2009. POLLS WILL COME OUT TO TELL WHAT\nTHE RACES LOOK LIKE, IS CONTROL OF THE HOUSE, PERHAPS, AT STAKE?\nOR MORE VULNERABLE SENATORS THAN WE EXPECTED?\n>> AND DONALD TRUMP SAID SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY LAST\nNIGHT AS WELL, WHEN HE SAID THAT, IF HE'S ELECTED PRESIDENT\nOF THE UNITED STATES HE WILL HAVE HIS JUSTICE DEPARTMENT NAME\nA SPECIAL PROSECUTOR TO REVIVE POTENTIAL CHARGES AGAINST\nHILLARY CLINTON, AND AT ONE POINT WAS GOING BACK AND FORTH\nAND SAID IF HE WAS PRESIDENT, SHE WOULD BE IN JAIL.\nI MEAN, THE NOTION OF, I MEAN -- THE FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL,\nERIC HOLDER, HE TWEETED THIS. HE WAS PRESIDENT OBAMA THE\nATTORNEY GENERAL, SUPPORTER OF HILLARY CLINTON SAID THIS --\nIN THE USA WE DO NOT THREATEN TO JAIL POLITICAL OPPONENTS.\nDONALD TRUMP SAID HE WOULD. HE IS PROMISING TO ABUSE THE\nPOWER OF THE OFFICE. >> IT WAS A REALLY EXTRAORDINARY\nMOMENT. IT WAS -- YOU HAVE NOT HEARD\nANYTHING LIKE THAT FROM A REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE\nFOR PRESIDENT. AND YOU -- YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW\nTHIS, BECAUSE YOU COVER THE WHITE HOUSE, AT DIFFERENT TIMES.\nAND THE WHITE HOUSE, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES\nIS, THE ROLE, MAINTAIN A BIT OF A DISTANCE.\nYOU WOULD NOT ORDER SOMETHING LIKE THAT.\nEVEN IN ANY SCENARIO. AND SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT I\nTHINK WILL PROBABLY GET PAID MORE ATTENTION TO ONCE WE MOVE A\nLITTLE PAST THE \"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD\" TAPE AND IT'S REALLY\nSIGNIFICANT AND SAYS A LOT ABOUT HOW DONALD TRUMP THINKS AND SEES\nHIS OPPONENTS, I DON'T ANY EVER A CASE IN AMERICAN HISTORY.\n>> NO. >> WHERE A PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATE OF ONE PARTY SAID IF I'M ELECTED, THE OTHER CANDIDATE\nIS GOING TO JAIL. >> NO.\nABSOLUTELY NOT. UNCHARTED TERRITORY.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE SAYING, YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE DEFINITION OF\nFASCISM. WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN OTHER\nCOUNTRIES WHERE THE GUY WINS AND PUTS HIS OPPONENTS IN JAIL OR\nGUY ORGANIZING THE COUP IS FLOWN JAIL BY THE DICTATOR.\nIT IS STUNNING. AND IT IS UNPRECEDENTED.\nAND YET AGAIN, FROM A CRASS POLITICAL PERSPECTIVE, WHAT HE\nDID AND SAID LAST NIGHT IS EXACTLY WHAT SO MANY REAL DYED\nIN THE WOOL ULTRA CONSERVATIVE HAVE WANTED A PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATE TO DO AND SAY TO THE FACE OF A CLINTON FOR MORE THAN\n20 YEARS, AND THEY GOT IT LAST NIGHT.\nTHAT'S GREAT. BUT IT WILL DO NOTHING MOST\nLIKELY TO HELP HIM WIN THE ELECTION.\n>> IT PLAYS TO THAT BASE, THAT VERY CONSERVATIVE BASE OF THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY THAT HE'S TRYING TO CONSOLIDATE BUT NEEDS\nA LOT MORE THAN THAT, JUANA, IF ELECTED PRESIDENT.\nHE'S GOT TO GO BEYOND THAT BASE? >> ABSOLUTELY DOES.\nIMPORTANT IT LOOK AT THE AREAS TRUMP IS LOSING IN TERMS OF\nPOLLS POORLY WITH WOMEN. HILLARY CLINTON IS BEGINNING TO\nCATCH HIM AMONG MEN. SAW A RECENT POLL PUTTING THEM\nWITH A ONE-POINT DIFFERENCE AMONG WHITE MEN I BELIEVE IT\nWAS. HUGE IF YOU LOOK AT PAST\nELECTORAL RESULTS. ONE OF THE THINGS REPUBLICANS\nHAVE TO LOOK AT MOVING FORWARD. HOW TO BROADEN THE BASE, BRING\nIN INDEPENDENTS, UNDECIDEDS, BRING THEM INTO THE FOLD AND\nTHAT LANGUAGE THAT ED DESCRIBED. I DON'T THINK THAT DOES THE\nTRICK WITH MANY OF THE GROUPS THAT DONALD TRUMP NEEDS TO WIN\nOVER. >> THE OTHER SET OF ISSUES,\nSENSITIVE ISSUE, OUR OWN ANDERSON COOPER PRESSED DONALD\nTRUMP ON THAT $916 BILLION TAX LOSS THAT HE TOOK IN ONE YEAR IN\nTHE 1990s. AND THE SUGGESTION THE NETANYAHU\nREPORTED THAT FOR MAYBE 19 YEARS WOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY ANY FEDERAL\nINCOME TAX. LISTEN TO THAT EXCHANGE.\n>> DID YOU USE THAT $916 MILLION LOSS TO AVOID PAYING PERSONAL\nFEDERAL INCOME TAXES -- >> OF COURSE I DO.\nOF COURSE I DO. >> CAN YOU SAY HOW MUCH YEARS\nYOU AVOIDED PAYING PERSONAL INCOME TAX?\n>> NO. BUT I PAY TAX AND I PAY FEDERAL\nTAX, TOO. >> SORT OF UNCLEAR WHETHER HE\nPAID ANY FEDERAL INCOME TAX AS A RESULT OF THAT $916 BILLION\nLOSS. >> RIGHT, BUT AGAIN HE SAID OF\nCOURSE I DO. OF COURSE I DID THAT.\nSO THAT FEEDS THIS PERCEPTION HE IS NOT PAYING TAXES IN A WAY\nTHAT MOST AMERICANS WOULD LIKE THE PRESIDENT OF THEIR, OF THE\nCOUNTRY TO CONTRIBUTE, AND I THINK THAT THE POLLS SHOW THAT\nTHIS IS AN ISSUE THAT MATTERS. THAT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT THIS\nISSUE, AND IF YOU STEP BACK AND LOOK BROADLY, HARD TO SEE ONE\nTHING THAT DONALD TRUMP SAID OR DID LAST NIGHT THAT MOVED PEOPLE\nWHO ALREADY WEREN'T IN HIS CAMP, AND THAT IS WHAT HE NEEDED 20 TO\nDO AND NEEDS TO DO IF HE WINS THE ELECTION.\nTHIS IS JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THAT.\n>> AN EXTREMELY ROUGH, TOUGH AND OCCASIONALLY VERY UGLY\nPRESIDENTIAL DEBATE LAST NIGHT. EXCEPT FOR THE LAST QUESTION.\nTHE LAST QUESTION THAT CAME UP IN THAT DEBATE WHEN SOMEONE\nSTOOD UP AND ASKED BOTH OF THESE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES TO SAY\nSOMETHING NICE ABOUT THE COMPETITION.\nLET ME PLAY THE CLIP. >> I RESPECT HIS CHILDREN.\nHIS CHILDREN ARE INCREDIBLY ABLE AND DEVOTED, AND I THINK THAT\nSAYS A LOT ABOUT DONALD. >> I CONSIDER THAT A COMPLIMENT.\nI WILL SAY THIS ABOUT HILLARY -- SHE DOESN'T QUIT.\nSHE DOESN'T GIVE UP. I TLAP. RESPECT THAT.\nI TELL IT LIKE IT IS. SHE'S A FIGHTER.\nI DISAGREE WITH MUCH OF WHAT SHE'S FIGHTING FOR.\nI DO DISAGREE WITH HER JUDGMENT IN MANY CASES, BUT SHE DOES\nFIGHT HARD, AND SHE DOESN'T QUIT, AND SHE DOESN'T GIVE UP\nAND I CONSIDER THAT TO BE A VERY GOOD TRAIT.\n>> AND AT THE END THEY WOUND UP SHAKING HANDS, WHICH IS\nSOMETHING THEY POINTEDLY DID NOT DO 90 MINUTES EARLIER WHEN THE\nDEBATE STARTED. >> RIGHT.\nAND JOHN PODESTO TOLD YOUR BRYANNA KEILAR THAT WAS\nINTENTION TO SEND A MESSAGE SHE WAS NOT PLEASED WITH THE TONE OF\nTHINGS. YOU COULD ALMOST HEAR AND\nAUDIBLE, LIKE -- AH -- WHEN THAT QUESTION WAS ASKED.\nSO TENSE IN THERE. EVEN WATCHING, YOU COULD SENSE\nHOW TENSE IT WAS AND ONE OF THE ONLY LIGHT MOMENTS OF THE\nEVENING. >> PROBABLY THE ONLY ONE.\nGOOD THEY THEY DID IT. WE NEEDED IT.\n>> AND I WAS EXPECTING HER TO SAY I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING NICE\nTO SAY ABOUT HIM AND FOR HIM 20 SAY, I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING NICE\nTO SAY -- BUT THEY STEPPED UP AND ENDED IT ON 0 MORE POSITIVE\nNOTE AND FINALLY SHOOK HANDS.",

MY HAT IS OFF TO YOU BILL\nCLINTON FOR TELLING DONALD TO RUN.\n>> I'M SURE HE IS NOT THAT PSYCHED ABOUT IT.\nTHAT WASN'T AN AWESOME MOMENT FOR BILL CLINTON LAST NIGHT.\n>> YEAH. >> WITH HIS DAUGHTER SITTING\nTHERE AND THE WOMEN AND PEOPLE HE PAID SETTLEMENTS TO.\n>> THERE WAS A LOT OF PICTURES. THAT PICTURE WITH HIS EYEBALLS\nFLIPPING. >> THAT WAS GOING PLACES.\nIS THIS GOING TO APPEAL TO ANYBODY OR JUST THE BASE?\n>> THAT'S WHY YOU SHOULD ASK ERIC.\n>> HE IS DEFERRING TO YOU. >> IT WILL APPEAL TO THE BASE.\n>> DID YOU HEAR HIS MUSIC, ALL ABOUT THAT BASE, ABOUT THE BASE?\n>> YOU HAVE TO EXPAND THAT BASE. >> THAT'S THE PROBLEM.\n>> YOU HAVE TO ADD MORE BASE. >> LOOK, TRUMP HAD ONE MISSION\nLAST NIGHT. IT WAS TO DIVERT ATTENTION FROM\nTHE HOT MIKE MOMENT. WITH THAT KIND OF STUFF, THAT'S\nWHAT HE DID. IF THAT WAS THE MISSION, I THINK\nHE ACCOMPLISHED THAT MISSION I WOULD SAY.\nLIVE TO FIGHT ANOTHER DAY, I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT.\nYOU HAVE ANOTHER NINE DAYS TO WORK ON DEBATE THREE, WHICH WILL\nBE THE DECIDING DEBATE. >> IT WILL BE.\nDANA, WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT IN THE FIRST DEBATE.\n>> I DON'T THINK SO. REMEMBER --\n>> YOU DIDN'T LIKE IT? I LIKED IT.\n>> AT THE CONVENTION, IN THE HALL WHEN THEY STARTED FIRST\nCHANTING LOCK HER UP, IT FREAKED ME OUT.\nI HAVE SAID, THERE'S LOTS OF OTHER GOOD CHANTS LIKE FOLLOW\nTHE MONEY WAS A GOOD ONE. I WOULD HAVE RUN WITH THAT.\nTHEY LIKE LOCK HER UP. LAST NIGHT, I THOUGHT I WAS\nDOING A FAVOR TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN BY TRYING TO DEFEND HIM\nFROM THE MEDIA WHO WAS SAYING, HE WANTS TO BE LIKE SOMETHING\nFROM THE CONGO AND TAKE OVER AND PROSECUTE HIS OPPONENT WHEN SHE\nDOESN'T WIN. SO I TRIED TO DEFEND HIM.\nNO, WHAT HE IS -- GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE FIRST DEBATE WHERE\nHE SAID HE WOULD RESPECT THE ELECTION RESULTS.\nTHEN I GOT ATTACKED. THEY DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR THAT.\nTHEY WANT HIM TO LOCK HER UP. THEY WANT HIM TO APPOINT A\nSPECIAL PROSECUTOR BECAUSE SHE ACTED LIKE SHE ABOVE THE LAW.\nTHEY WANTED IT. THEY LOVED IT.\n>> SHE HAS. >> I DON'T THINK IT WILL WORK.\n>> SHE HAS ACTED IN EVERY WAY LIKE SHE'S ABOVE THE LAW AND\nTHERE ARE OTHERS SIMILARLY SITUATED OR HAVE COMMITTED LESS\nEGREGIOUS CRIMES THAT ACTUALLY DID GET LOCKED UP.\nAS A PROSECUTOR, I WOULD GO AFTER HER.\nWHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO, GIVE HER A PASS?\nNO. THE BOTTOM LINE IS, SHE KNOWS.\nSHE KNOWS WHAT SHE DID. SHE KNOWS IT'S A DELIBERATE ACT.\nTHE DECK WAS STACKED IN HER FAVOR.\n>> LET ME SAY, I'M NOT A PROSECUTOR.\nI WILL DEFER TO YOU ON THAT. I GOTTA SAY, JIM CO COMEY SAID\nTHERE WAS NO EFFORT HE FOUND BY HILLARY CLINTON TO DELETE OR\nINTENTIONALLY DELETE E-MAILS IN AN EFFORT TO CONCEAL THEM.\nNEVER. >> AND INTENT IS NOT AN ASPECT\nOF REQUISITE -- >> THEN HE SAID, KIMBERLY, YOU\nKNOW WHAT? THERE IS NO PROSECUTOR, NONE,\nWHO WOULD GO AFTER THIS WOMAN. >> THAT'S ALSO NOT TRUE.\n>> I'M JUST TELLING YOU -- >> TALK TO GIULIANI AND CHRIS\nCHRISTIE AND KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE. >> LOOK AT IT AND YOU WILL COME\nTO THE SAME CONCLUSION. >> JUAN THERE ARE --\n>> I DON'T THINK -- >> THERE ARE E-MAILS THAT AREN'T\nAVAILABLE. WE'RE FINDING OUT AS RECENTLY AS\nTODAY THAT SOME OF THE PODEST E-MAILS MAY IMPICATE THE\nCAMPAIGN. AS TIME GOES, WE ARE FINDING OUT\nMORE AND MORE. >> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE\nE-MAILS AND LOCK HER UP. YOU JUST SHIFTED THE TOPIC.\nI'M SAYING OVERALL -- >> WE'RE FINDING OUT MORE\nTHINGS. >> 2,000 E-MAILS.\n>> I GOTTA GO. >> HIS CREW WANTS DRAWN AND\nQUARTERED. >> TELL ME ABOUT THE SNIFFLING.\nI KNOW THERE'S MORE PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THE SNIFFLING.\n>> I DON'T KNOW.",

THE PROBLEM REALLY I THINK IS JN\nRA GENERATED BY PRESIDENT OBAMA'S\nDECISION TO DRAW A RED LINE AND TELL THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT THAT\nTHEY COULD NOT CROSS IT AND WHAT THAT MEANT WAS THEY COULDN'T USE\nCHEMICAL WEAPONS AGAINST THEIR OWN PEOPLE.\nTHEY WENT RIGHT AHEAD AND DID IT AND THE UNITED STATES SHRUGGED\nAND HANDED THE PROBLEM OVER TO RUSSIA.\n>> DIRECTOR -- >> WE AS A RESULT ARE NOT BEING\nCONSIDERED SERIOUSLY IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD.\n>> I'M A LITTLE PERPLEXED BY YOUR STATEMENT HERE.\nDO YOU NOT KNOW WHAT THE POLICY OF THE CAMPAIGN IS WHEN IT COMES\nTO USING FORCE? >> I'M GOING TO LET THE\nCANDIDATES THEMSELVES COMMUNICATE THE POLICY TO THE\nPUBLIC, NOT ME. >> ARE YOU CONFUSED BY THE\nDIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO? LET'S PLAY IT FOR OUR VIEWERS SO\nWE CAN ALL DISCUSS IT. HERE IS WHERE THE CONFUSION\nLIES. MIKE PENCE WAS ASKED ABOUT WHAT\nTO DO ABOUT SYRIA AND THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN ALEPPO\nDURING THE VP DEBATE. THIS IS WHAT HE SAID.\n>> THE PROVOCATIONS BY RUSSIA NEED TO BE MET WITH AMERICAN\nSTRENGTH AND IF RUSSIA CHOOSES TO BE INVOLVED AND CONTINUE, I\nSHOULD SAY, TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS BARBARIC ATTACK ON\nCIVILIANS IN ALEPPO, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SHOULD BE\nPREPARED TO USE MILITARY FORCE TO STRIKE MILITARY TARGETS OF\nTHE ASSAD REGIME, TO PREVENT THEM FROM THIS HUMANITARIAN\nCRISIS THAT IS TAKING PLACE IN ALEPPO.\n>> AND THEN DONALD TRUMP WAS ASKED THE EXACT SAME QUESTION IN\nLAST NIGHT'S DEBATE. LISTEN.\n>> WHAT WOULD YOU DO ABOUT SYRIA AND THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN\nALEPPO, AND I WANT TO REMIND YOU WHAT YOUR RUNNING MATE SAID.\nHE SAID PROVOCATIONS BY RUSSIA NEED TO BE MET WITH AMERICAN\nSTRENGTH AND THAT IF RUSSIA CONTINUES TO BE INVOLVED IN AIR\nSTRIKES ALONG WITH THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT FORCES OF ASSAD, THE\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA SHOULD BE PREPARED TO USE MILITARY\nFORCE TO STRIKE THE MILITARY TARGETS OF THE ASSAD REGIME.\n>> OKAY. HE AND I HAVEN'T SPOKEN AND I\nDISAGREE. I DISAGREE.\n>> WHERE IS THIS DISAGREEMENT? >> THAT'S FOR THE CANDIDATES TO\nSORT OUT. I'M AN ADVISER.\nI'M NOT GOING TO SORT OUT THE POLITICS AND DECISION MAKING FOR\nYOU. I WILL BE GLAD TO TELL YOU WHAT\nI THINK THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES ARE OF VARIOUS\nCOURSES OF ACTION. >> DO YOU AGREE WITH MIKE PENCE\nOR DONALD TRUMP ON THIS? >> I'M NOT GOING TO PUT A STAKE\nIN THE GROUND ON BEHALF OF ONE OR THE OTHER OR AN INTERMEDIATE\nPOSITION. I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT I\nTHINK WOULD BE WISE. I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO THAT\nFOR A COUPLE MINUTES HERE BUT YOU SEEM TO WANT TO GET ME INTO\nPOLITICS WHICH IS NOT MY FIELD. >> MR. DIRECTOR, BUT YOU ARE\nJAMES WOOLSEY, FORMER CIA DIRECTOR, NATIONAL SECURITY\nADVISER TO THE DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN.\nWHEN IT COMES TO A KEY POLICY POSITION THAT YOU WOULD ASSUME\nWOULD BE A UNIFIED POSITION OF THE CAMPAIGN, I WOULD ALSO\nASSUME YOU WOULD KNOW WHAT IT IS AND BE ABLE TO VOICE IT.\n>> I'M NOT TELLING YOU ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.\nTHE CANDIDATES ARE THE ONES WHO ARE GOING TO COMMUNICATE THE\nPOLICY DECISIONS TO THE PUBLIC, NOT ME.\n>> WHY DOES IT MAKE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE?\n>> IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MAKE ME UNCOMFORTABLE.\nI'M JUST REFUSING TO DO IT. I THINK THEY'RE THE ONES WHO ARE\nRUNNING FOR OFFICE. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO OUGHT TO\nCREATE THE DOCTRINE AND THE POLICIES AND SHAPE THEM THE WAY\nTHEY WANT. NOT AN ADVISER.\n>> ONE OTHER QUESTION WHILE WE HAVE YOU HERE.\nWHAT WAS YOUR REACTION WHEN YOU HEARD THE \"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD\"\nTAPE WHERE DONALD TRUMP WAS BRAGGING ABOUT BEING ABLE TO\nGRAB WOMEN'S GENITALIA AND GET AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE HE WAS\nFAMOUS? >> I WORK ON NATIONAL SECURITY\nMATTERS. I HAVE WORKED FOR FOUR\nPRESIDENTS, TWO REPUBLICANS, TWO DEMOCRATS, ON NATIONAL SECURITY\nMATTERS OF ALL KINDS, COUNTER TERRORISM, SIZE OF THE MILITARY,\nTHE NAVY, ARMS CONTROL. THAT'S WHAT I DO.\nI DON'T ASSESS WHAT'S GOING ON POLITICALLY IN THE CAMPAIGN.\nTHAT'S NOT MY POSITION. >> I'M NOT SURE THAT'S A\nPOLITICAL QUESTION. >> YEAH, IT IS AS FAR AS I'M\nCONCERNED. IT'S VERY POLITICAL.\nI'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO POLITICS.\nI'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT SUBSTANCE.\nIF YOU DON'T WANT ME TO TALK ABOUT SUBSTANCE THEN DON'T IN\nVOI VIET ME ON YOUR SHOW.\n>> I WAS TRYING TO ASK YOU ABOUT SUBSTANCE ON SYRIA AND YOU DID\nNOT WANT TO ARTICULATE A POSITION.\n>> YOU WANT TO TALK POLITICS AND JUDGMENTS.\nTHAT'S NOT WHAT I'M HERE TO DO. >> WHAT IS THE CAMPAIGN'S PLAN\nON STOPPING THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN SYRIA?\n>> I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE A POSITION.\nI WILL TELL YOU IF YOU WANT ME TO WHAT I THINK THE PROS AND\nCONS ARE OF VARIOUS COURSES OF ACTION WITH RESPECT TO SYRIA,\nRUSSIA AND WHERE THE PROBLEM CAME FROM AND THE SUBSTANCE BUT\nI'M NOT GOING TO TALK THE POLITICS.\n>> ALL RIGHT.

YOU NEED TO BE WILLING TO USE --\nYOU NEED TO BE WILLING TO USE RESOURCES, INCLUDING MILITARY\nPOWER, TO SECURE THOSE SAFE ZONES TO ALLOW THOSE PEOPLE,\nINCLUDING 100,000 CHILDREN, TO BE ABLE TO EVACUATE.\nLAST NIGHT SHE CONFLATED THAT AND REFERRED TO GENERAL\nPROVOCATION AND PROBLEMS BY THE RUSSIANS IN THE SYRIAN REGIME.\nYOU KNOW, DONALD TRUMP'S MADE IT CLEAR.\nOUR POLICY IS SAFE ZONES FOR PEOPLE SUFFERING IN SYRIA.\n>> SO, WE REALLY WANTED TO HONE IN ON THE VIR SSYRIA ISSUE.\nCLARISSA WARD, YOU'VE COVERED SYRIA EXTENSIVELY.\nONE YOU WOULD TAKE AWAY FROM TRUMP, HE HASN'T TALKED TO HIS\nRUNNING MATE, NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO, HE SAID ALEPPO IS A\nSDAERS. IT ISN'T LIKE ASSAD.\nQUOTE, ASSAD IS KILLING ISIS. WHEN YOU HEARD THAT, DID YOU\nREAD THAT AS TRUMP PRAISING ASSAD?\nWHAT DID YOU MAKE OF HIS RESPONSE?\n>> WHAT I MADE OF HIS RESPONSE IS ESSENTIALLY HE'S BRANDING\nHIMSELF AS SORT OF AN APOLOGIST FOR ASSAD AND RUSSIA AND IRAN\nAND THE ACTION THOSE THREE FORCES HAVE TAKEN COMBINED\nTOGETHER INSIDE SYRIA. WHAT HE'S ESSENTIALLY SAYING IS,\nIT'S UFRTD THAT THEY'RE KILLING ALL THESE OTHER PEOPLE, BUT\nTHEY'RE ALSO KILLING ISIS. TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, THAT IS\nTRUE. RUSSIA DID WITH ASSAD'S FORCES\nTAKE BACK THE ANCIENT CITY OF PALMYRA FROM ISIS.\nWE THERE IS SOME TRUTH TO THAT.\nWHAT IS-T IGNORES IS THE LARGER PICTURE WHEN SHOWS QUITE QUICKLY\nTHAT ISIS HAS THRIVED PRECISELY BECAUSE OF ASSAD'S ATROCITIES.\nIT HAS GROWN AS A RESULT OF THE VACUUM LEFT BY THE SYRIAN CIVIL\nWAR. WHEN YOU SPEND TIME IN ALEPPO,\nAS I DO, YOU SEE AND UNDERSTAND FIRSTHAND HOW IT IS THAT THIS\nDEVASTATING HUMANITARIAN CONFLICT IS QUICKLY TURNING INTO\nAN INCUBATOR FOR EXTREMISM. WHAT ALSO CONFUSED ME IS THAT\nDONALD TRUMP ALSO SAYS HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE SAFE ZONES.\nSO, ON THE ONE HAND HE SEEMS TO BE WILLING TO LET ASSAD DO HIS\nTHING, ALONG WITH RUSSIANS AND IRANIANS.\nIT WOULD BE INTERESTING FOR ME TO SEE HOW HE PLANS TO IMPLEMENT\nTHESE SAFE ZONES BECAUSE THIS IS AN IDEA THAT OBVIOUSLY HAS BEEN\nPUT FORWARD BY MANY DIFFERENT DIPLOMATS AS MANY DIFFERENT\nJUNCTURES IN THIS CONFLICT. THE REALITY IS THAT THE ASSAD\nREGIME HAS NOT BEEN AMENABLE TO THAT, NOR HAVE ITS RUSSIAN\nBACKERS. THERE'S A LOT OF CONFLICTION IN\nTHE SYRIAN POLICY. >> THAT WAS TRUMP.\nTHIS IS HILLARY CLINTON'S RESPONSE TO WHAT SHE WOULD DO IN\nSYRIA. >> I WOULD NOT USE AMERICAN\nGROUND FORCES IN SYRIA. I THINK THAT WOULD BE A VERY\nSERIOUS MISTAKE. DON'T THINK AMERICAN TROOPS\nSHOULD BE HOLDING TERRITORY, WHICH IS WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO\nDO AS AN OCCUPYING FORCE. I DON'T THINK THAT IS A SMART\nSTRATEGY. I DO THINK THE USE OF SPECIAL\nFORCES, WHICH WE'RE USING, THE USE OF ENABLERS AND TRAINERS IN\nIRAQ, WHICH HAS HAD SOME POSITIVE EFFECTS, ARE VERY MUCH\nIN OUR INTERESTS. >> IT SOUNDED TO ME THAT HER\nRESPONSE WAS VERY SIMILAR TO THE STRATEGY OF THE CURRENT\nADMINISTRATION AND EVEN WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA HIMSELF WAS\nASKED ABOUT SYRIA LAST MONTH, HE SAID IT HAUNTS HIM.\nYOU KNOW, IN TERMS OF HELPING IN THE WAR THEN, WHAT -- DID YOU\nHEAR ENOUGH IN HER RESPONSE? >> ONE VERY MAJOR DIFFERENCE\nFROM PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA. SHE SAID SHE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A\nNO-FLY ZONE IMPLEMENTED IN SYRIA.\nTHAT WOULD OFFER SOME KIND OF PROTECTION TO THE CIVILIANS WHO\nHAVE LIVED UNDER THAT RELENTLESS BOMBARDMENT FOR FIVE YEARS NOW.\nBUT SHE DIDN'T GIVE ANY DETAILS ON HOW THAT NO-FLY ZONE WOULD BE\nIMPLEMENTED. THE JURY IS NOT OUT ON THIS ONE.\nA LOT OF ANALYSTS ARE SAYING, HOLD O THAT'S A MAJOR MILITARY\nINVESTMENT. IT WOULD REQUIRE POTENTIALLY\nESCALATING THE CONFLICT IN SYRIA EVEN FURTHER BECAUSE IT IS THE\nRUSSIAN FIGHTER JETS WHO ARE RULING THE SKIES OVER NORTHERN\nSYRIA RIGHT NOW, NOT THE U.S. BUT CERTAINLY THIS IS A\nSIGNIFICANT DEPARTURE FROM THE POLICY OF PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA\nAND POTENTIALLY ONE THAT THE PEOPLE OF SYRIA WOULD VERY MUCH\nWELCOME, BROOKE. >>LL, YOU'RE ONE TO TALK\nHAVING TESTIFIED AT THE UNITED NATIONS AND BEING TO SYRIA\nMULTIPLE TIMES.

WE'RE BACK WITH DEMOCRATIC\nSENATOR CHRIS KUHNS OF DELAWARE. THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS NOW\nCONSIDERING EXPANDING EFFORTS IN STATES LIKE ARIZONA, GEORGIA,\nINDIANA, MISSOURI TO HELP WITH SO-CALLED DOWN BALLOT RACES.\nDO YOU THINK THERE'S A CHANCE TRUMP IS GIVING DEMOCRATS THE\nOPPORTUNITY TO POTENTIALLY TAKE BACK CONTROL OF THE SENATE AND\nMAYBE EVEN THE HOUSE? >> ABSOLUTELY, WOLF.\nI THINK WE NOW HAVE A STRONG CHANCE TO NOT JUST TAKE BACK THE\nSENATE, BUT TAKE BACK THE SENATE WITH A SEVERAL VOTE MARGIN.\nFOR THOSE THAT SUPPORT SECRETARY CLINTON, IT'S IMPORTANT TO\nREMEMBER THAT HAVING CONTROL OF THE WHITE HOUSE AND NOT HAVING\nCONTROL OF THE SENATE MAKES IT EXCEPTIONALLY HARD FOR ANY\nPRESIDENT TO ADVANCE HIS OR HER AGENDA.\nTHE HOUSE IS A MUCH BIGGER MARGIN IN TERMS OF REPUBLICANS\nAND DEMOCRATS RIGHT NOW. BUT THERE ARE MORE THAN A DOZEN\nSEATS THAT ARE NOW IN PLAY THAT WERE NOT IN PLAY EVEN A FEW\nWEEKS AGO. SO THE REVELATIONS ABOUT DONALD\nTRUMP BRAGGING ABOUT A SEXUAL ASSAULT AND THE DIVISION WITHIN\nTHE REPUBLICAN PARTY, THE REVULSION BY MANY AVERAGE\nVOTERS, THAT'S CERTAINLY CHANGED THE LANDSCAPE FOR THE ELECTION.\n>> ON SYRIA, SENATOR, CLINTON REITERATED HER STANCE AGAINST\nU.S. GROUND TROOPS GETTING INVOLVED.\nSHE WANTS TO CONTINUE USING SPECIAL FORCES, DIRECT ARMING OF\nKURDISH FIGHTERS. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?\nHOW WOULD THAT IMPACT THE U.S. RELATIONSHIP, FOR EXAMPLE, WITH\nTURKEY, THE OVERALL BALANCE IN THE REGION AND WOULD IT MAKE\nMUCH OF A DIFFERENCE? >> WE HAVE TO HAVE COMPETENT\nGROUND FORCES THAT WE CAN TRAIN AND WORK WITH, THAT WE CAN EQUIP\nAND COUNT ON TO TAKE MOSUL AND RAQQAH.\nWE NEED TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT TRAINING, ARMING, AND EQUIPPING\nCREDIBLE GROUND FORCES. THE KURDS IN NORTHEASTERN SYRIA\nAND NORTHERN IRAQ HAVE BEEN SOME OF THE MOST ABLE FIGHTERS ON THE\nBATTLEFIELD. THE QUESTION YOU RAISE, WOLF,\nABOUT WHETHER IT WOULD COMPLICATE OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH\nTURKEY IS AN IMPORTANT AND PRESSING CONCERN.\nWE'VE HAD REAL TENSIONS WITH TURKEY OVER THEIR INTERNAL\nAFFAIRS, OVER THE ATTEMPTED COUP AND THE RESPONSE TO IT, AND IT'S\nVITAL THAT WE ALSO HAVE TURKEY FIGHTING ALONGSIDE REGIONAL\nFORCES AS WE BEGIN TO MOVE ON RAQQAH IN SYRIA.\n>> HOW ABOUT PUTIN, HOW SHOULD SHE DEAL WITH PUTEN?\n>> FORCEFULLY AND DECISIVELY. THE ANSWERS SHE'S GIVEN IN\nINTERVIEWS AND THE DEBATE SUGGEST THAT SHE'S FAR BETTER\nPREPARED TO STAIR DOWN PUTIN AND TO DEAL WITH HIS AGGRESSIVENESS,\nBOTH IN EASTERN EUROPE AND CRIMEA, UKRAINE AND IN THE\nMIDDLE EAST THAN HER OPPONENT, DONALD TRUMP.\nTHROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN, DONALD TRUMP HAS REALLY STRUGGLED TO\nEXPLAIN HIS PUBLIC EXPRESSIONS OF ADMIRATION FOR PUTIN.\nPUTIN, WHO IS AN AUTOCRATIC THUG, FRANKLY, AND WHO HAS\nINVADED A NEIGHBORING COUNTRY, WHO HAS LED BY KILLING IN MANY\nCASES DISSIDENTS AND REPORTERS, AND WHOSE BEHAVIOR IN WESTERN\nEUROPE HAS LED HIM TO BE SANCTIONED BY OUR ALLIES.\nTO EXPRESSION ADMIRATION FOR THIS MAN AND SAY HE ADMIRES HIM\nMORE THAN OUR OWN PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA STRIKES ME AS YET\nANOTHER POINT OF PROOF THAT DONALD TRUMP JUST ISN'T READY TO\nLEAD THIS COUNTRY. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR\nJOINING US.",

THE ISSUE WITH DONALD TRUMP\nTHROWING PENCE UNDER THE BUS, PENCE ARTICULATED A REVIEW THAT\nI THINK A LOT OF REPUBLICANS HAVE, ABOUT WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN\nWITH RESPECT TO U.S. POLICY GOING FORWARD.\nWHAT TRUMP NEEDS TO DO, IF HE IS SERIOUS ABOUT TALKING ABOUT\nPOLICY HE DOES NEED TO SAY HERE IS WHERE I DIFFER FROM MY\nRUNNING MATE AND HERE ARE THE TWO OR THREE THINGS I WITH DO\nWITH RESPECT TO SYRIA, HE KEEPS TALKING ABOUT KNOCKING OUT ISIS.\nIT'S NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT HE WOULD DO.\nHE NEEDS TO BE CLEARER ABOUT THAT.\nIF HE IS GOING TO SAY I DISAGREE WITH MIKE PENCE, I THINK HE HAS\nTO TELL US HOW HE DISAGREES AND THEN THEY HAVE TO GET ON THE\nSAME PAGE. >> IT IS RELEVANT, EVERY TIME HE\nARTI ARTICULATES A POLICY IN THE\nMIDDLE EAST, HE ENDS UP PARROTING VLADIMIR PUTIN, WHERE\nAS YOU SAID LLONNIE, THEY'RE DISAGREEING, SO WHICH IS IT?\n>> THIS IS A POLL TAKEN AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE TAPE, SHOWING\nHILLARY CLINTON LEADING BY 11 POINTS.\nDOES THIS SUPPORT PAUL RYAN'S CONCLUSION THAT TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN\nIS BEYOND SAVING, HILLARY ROSEN? >> LOOK, I WISH THAT IT WERE\nTRUE. THAT TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN IS BEYOND\nSAVING. I'M NOT A PUNDIT TODAY WHO IS\nTAKING A VICTORY LAP. YOU KNOW WE HAVE SEVERAL WEEKS\nTO GO BEFORE THIS ELECTION. WE CANNOT TAKE ANYTHING FOR\nGRANTED. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE SEEN THE GUY\nRISE FROM THE ASHES BEFORE. AND SO I THINK THAT AWAY PAUL\nRYAN IS DOING IS SAYING REALLY CARE.\nI'M GOING TO FOCUS ON OUR CAUCUS FIRST, AND WE'RE GOING TO\nDISTANCE OURSELVES JUST TO PLAY IT SAFE.\nBUT I DON'T THINK THAT MEANS THAT DONALD TRUMP IS YOU KNOW,\nALL OF A SUDDEN AS NO CHANCE TO BE PRESIDENT.\nI THINK IT MEANS THAT PAUL RYAN IS LOOKING FOR MONEY AND\nRESOURCES TO SUPPORT HIS OWN CAUCUS?\n>> WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS? MANY PEOPLE HAVE COUNTED OUT\nDONALD TRUMP BEFORE AND HAVE BEEN QUITE WRONG ABOUT IT.\nDO YOU THINK THAT PAUL RYAN IS SAYING DONALD TRUMP CAN'T WIN?\n>> NO, I THINK HILLARY ROSEN HIT IT QUITE WELL, IF DONALD TRUMP\nWINS THAT IS GREAT TOO. BUT HE HAS TO MAKE SURE HE\nMAINTAINS THE HOUSE. I THINK HE IS HUNKERING DOWN AND\nFOCUSING ON THAT.

IT'S LIKE WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA\nWAS ABLE TO DO, SO THERE IS AN UNDERCURRENT THAT IS NOT SHOWING\nUP. I HAVE NOT BEEN POLLED THIS\nWHOLE ELECTION. THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS LIKE\nME. >> LONNIE, DOES THAT SHOW THE\nMEASURE -- >> I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO DRAW\nBIG CROWDS, THAT IS THE NATURE OF THE CAMPAIGN.\nONE INTERESTING THING THAT CAME OUT TODAY, DONALD TRUMP IS\nLAGGING MITT ROMNEY BY 20 POINTS.\nYOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP ATTRACTING ABOUT 70-SOMETHING OF THE\nREPUBLICAN VOTERS. I THINK THE CHALLENGE THAT THE\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS AHEAD OF THEM PART OF IT IS THEY HAVE TO SORT\nOF REMIND REPUBLICANS OVER AND OVER AGAIN LOOK, THIS WILL STILL\nBE YOUR GUY. I THINK IN THAT SENSE, THE\nDEBATE WILL BE HELPFUL FOR THEM. PAUL RYAN SURPRISED ME TODAY, HE\nIS JUST BASICALLY SAYING I AM GOING TO FOCUS ON WHAT I NEED TO\nDO. DONALD TRUMP WILL FOCUS ON WHAT\nHE NEEDS TO DO. LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS AS WE GO\nDOWN THE STRETCH. THERE IS A BIGGER QUESTION ON\nHOW IT AFFECTS HIS FUTURE PERSONALLY.\n>> THIS WAS THE LAST WEEK, ESSENTIALLY, THAT ALL OF THESE\nCANDIDATES FOR HOUSE AND SENATE ARE RAISING MONEY, BECAUSE IF\nYOU DON'T GET THE MONEY IN, IN THESE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS, YOU\nWON'T BE ABLE TO GET AIR TIME OR HIRE YOUR GET OUT THE VOTE\nTEAMS. SO EVERYBODY IS MAKING AS DIRE A\nCONSEQUENCE A CASE AS THEY CAN, IN ORDER TO RAISE MONEY THIS\nWEEK FOR THEIR FINAL PUSH. AND REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO TRY\nTO DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM DONALD TRUMP BY GOING OUT ON\nTHEIR OWN. DEMOCRATS WILL NOT LET THEM.\n>> THANK YOU, I APPRECIATE IT. MANY ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS\nWHO ENDORSED DONALD TRUMP ARE JUMPING SHIP.\nAND SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE JUMPED ON THAT.\n>> MANY REPUBLICANS HAVE STOOD BY YOU THROUGH A LOT OF OTHER\nSCANDALS BUT NOW ARE PULLING THEIR SUPPORT.\nPEOPLE LIKE SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN.

THEY SAY ABSOLUTELY NOT.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN COUNTED OUT SO MANY TIMES BEFORE, THEY\nSAY THEY'VE GOT TO KEEP RUNNING THEIR RACE AND STAY ON MESSAGE\nAND STAY ON TRACK. >> WE ARE WATCHING, KRISTIN, YOU\nSAW KELLY O'DONNELLO'DONNELL, M MAY TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE\nHEADLINES IN THE NEWS. WHILE WE'RE WAITING, I WANT TO\nASK YOU ABOUT SOMETHING THAT THIS IDEA -- WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL\nIMPLOSION OR THIS CRISIS IN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, WHAT IS\nHAPPENING WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN IS DISTRACTING NOW FROM NEWS OF\nTHESE NEW WIKILEAK DOCUMENTS. WOULD THAN A BIGGER DEAL, IF IT\nWERE NOT FOR THIS? >> IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD BE IF\nIT WEREN'T FOR THIS IMPLOSION REASON THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\nIT WOULD BE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.\nIT IS DETRACTING AWAY FROM ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK THAT IS\nGOING TO BE A PROBLEM FOR THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN TO SOME EXTENT,\nSHE WAS PRESSED ON THIS ISSUE DURING THE DEBATE IN PART\nBECAUSE DURING THESE SPEECHES, THESE LEAKED TRANSCRIPTS THAT\nWE'RE NOW GETTING, REVEAL THAT SHE SAID IN ONE OF THE SPEECHES\nTHAT POLITICIANS HAVE TO BE DIFFERENT IN THEIR PUBLIC LIFE\nTHAN THEY ARE PRIVATELY AND SHE SAID THAT'S PART OF THE SAUSAGE\nMAKING OF POLICY-MAKING. AND SHE, LAST NIGHT, WHEN SHE\nWAS PRESSED ON THIS, LOOK, I WAS REFERENCING ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND\nA TACTIC THAT HE TOOK TO GET THE 13th AMENDMENT PASSED, BUT THIS\nCOULD FEED INTO THE LACK OF TRUST.\nI TALKED TO CLINTON CAMPAIGN OFFICIALS, AND TO WHAT EXTENT\nARE YOU CONCERNED THIS IS GOING TO FEED INTO VOTERS LACK OF\nTRUST IN HER. THEY SAY LOOK, SHE IS PREPARED\nTO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. BUT TO TRY TO STAY FOCUSED ON\nPOLICY ISSUES, WHICH THEY THINK ULTIMATELY IS WHAT SHE'LL WHIP\nTHE RACE ON. >> WE'LL DIVE MORE INTO THE\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN LATER THIS HOUR.\nRIGHT NOW, I WANT TO TURN TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.\nA LITTLE FACT CHECK NOW AS WE MOVE ON.\nMIKE PENCE, SWEARING HE AND TRUMP HAVE THE SAME POSITION\nWHEN IT COMES TO THE U.S. MILITARY AND THE HUMANITARIAN\nCRIES IN SYRIA. LISTEN TO WHAT HE TOLD MSNBC\nTODAY. >> MARTHA RADDATZ\nMISCHARACTERIZED WHAT I SAID IN THE VICE-PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE.\n>> SO AS WE WAIT FOR MIKE PENCE TO TAKE THE STAGE AT HIS RALLY\nIN NORTH CAROLINA DID MARTHA RADDATZ MISCHARACTERIZE HIS\nCOMMENTS. >> IF YOU WERE PRESIDENT, WHAT\nWOULD YOU DO ABOUT SYRIA AND HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN ALEPPO?\nI WANT TO REMIND YOU WHAT YOUR RUNNING MATE SAID.\n>> I JUST HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT THE PROVOCATIONS BY RUSSIA NEED\nTO BE MET WITH AMERICAN STRENGTH.\n>> HE SAID PROVOCATIONS BY RUSSIA NEED TO BE MET WITH\nAMERICAN STRENGTH. >> AND IF RUSSIA CHOOSES TO BE\nINVOLVED AND CONTINUE I SHOULD SAY TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS\nATTACK ON CIVILIANS. >> THAT IF RUSSIA CONTINUES TO\nBE INVOLVED IN AIR STRIKES ALONG WITH THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT\nFORCES OF ASSAD. >> THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\nSHOULD BE PREPARED TO USE MILITARY FORCE TO STRIKE\nMILITARY TARGETS OF THE ASSAD REGIME.\n>> THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SHOULD BE PREPARED TO USE\nMILITARY FORCE TO STRIKE THE MILITARY TARGETS OF THE ASSAD\nREGIME. >> FOR MORE NOW ON THE STATE OF\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN ON THAT DEBATE MOMENT AND MORE, LET'S\nBRING IN SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT POLICY AND\nWHAT APPEARS TO BE A SPLIT BETWEEN THE TOP OF THE TICKET\nAND MIKE PENCE, BUT FIRST, I HAVE TO START WITH THE BIG NEWS\nOF THE DAY. PAUL RYAN, NOW COMING OUT AND\nSAYING HE WILL NOT DEFEND OR CAMPAIGN WITH YOUR CANDIDATE.\nTHAT HAS GOT TO BE A CONCERN FOR YOU, MOVING FORWARD.\n>> YOU KNOW, HONESTLY, I REALLY DON'T THINK IT IS.\nSINCE DAY ONE, OUR CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN A GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT THAT\nHASN'T CHANGED. IT IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE.\nTHE FOCUS IS ON GETTING THE SUPPORTS AND ENDORSEMENTS FOR\nMILLIONS OF AMERICANS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY.\nNOT NECESSARILY THE CROWD FROM WASHINGTON.\nBUT THE RANK AND FILE FOLKS FROM NORTH TO SOUTH, EAST TO WEST,\nTHAT'S WHO WE'RE FOCUSED ON. IT IS A REAL GRASSROOTS\nMOVEMENT. IT HASN'T CHANGED.\nTHAT'S HOW THE CAMPAIGN STARTED. IT HAS BEEN A MOVEMENT.\nNOT NECESSARILY A TYPICAL CAMPAIGN.\nI DON'T THINK THIS CHANGES THAT AT ALL.\n>> AND SARAH, I WANT TO REMIND EVERYBODY, WE'RE WAITING ON MIKE\nPENCE TO TAKE THE STAGE IN NORTH CAROLINA.\nYOU SAW THAT OR HEARD THE MOMENT WE PLAYED FROM THE DEBATE.\nIT SOUNDS AS THOUGH THERE IS A REAL SPLIT BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP\nAND MIKE PENCE, WHEN IT COMES TO POLICY ON THE HUMANITARIAN\nCRISIS IN SYRIA. IS THERE?\n>> LOOK, I THINK THEY'VE BOTH BEEN CONSISTENT.\nTHE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IS TO DEFEAT ISIS. WE'LL DEAL WITH ASSAD AFTER WE\nDEFEAT ISIS. THEY'VE BEEN CONSISTENT ON THAT.\nTHAT PART HASN'T CHANGED. >> LET'S BRING UP OUR NBC \"WALL\nSTREET JOURNAL\" POLLING THAT CAME OUT IN THE LAST HOUR.\nFOUR-WAY RACE, TRUMP TRAILING CLINTON BY 11 POINTS, OUR NEW\nPOLL ALSO SHOWING THAT SOME 14% OF VOTERS WANT TRUMP TO DROP OUT\nOF THE RACE. I HAVE TO ASK YOU, THIS HAS BEEN\nCHARACTERIZED AS SOME POLITICAL OBSERVERS AS REACHING LANDSLIDE\nTERRITORY, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE NUMBERS THAT CAME OUT\nAFTER THE RELEASE OF THE AUDIO ON FRIDAY, WHAT GOES THROUGH\nYOUR MIND? >> LOOK, I THINK THE POLL WAS\nTAKEN PLACE BEFORE DONALD TRUMP'S VERY DIVISIVE WIN AT THE\nDEBATE LAST NIGHT. THAT CHANGED THE STATE OF THE\nRACE. I THINK IT CERTAINLY SHIFTED.\nIT IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH OTHER POLLS OUT.\nTHERE IS THE LA TIMES POLL THAT HAS TRUMP UP BY FOUR.\nPOLITICO HAS IT WITHIN THE MARGIN OF ERROR CLOSER TO A TIE.\nI THINK TO LOOK AT THIS PARTICULARLY BEFORE LAST NIGHT'S\nDEBATE, I THINK THAT CHANGED A LOT OF THINGS.\nCERTAINLY BROUGHT UNDECIDED VOTERS ON TO DONALD TRUMP'S\nTEAM. AND EXPOSED HILLARY FOR FRANKLY\nTHE FRAUD THAT SHE IS. ANYBODY THAT COMES OUT OF LAST\nNIGHT SAYING THAT HILLARY CLINTON WON THAT DEBATE PROBABLY\nALSO BELIEVES HER STORY OF WHEN IT COMES TO THE E-MAIL SCANDAL.\n>> I HAVE TO ASK YOU, IS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STOPPING THE\nBLEEDING, WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS AND TRYING TO MAKE THE TURN AND\nTURN THE CAMPAIGN AROUND AND CLOSE THE GAP?\nIS FEELS AS THOUGH THERE MIGHT BE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN THAT\nREGARD. >> I THINK DONALD TRUMP DID BOTH\nOF THOSE THINGS LAST NIGHT. HE CAME ACROSS AS PRESIDENTIAL\nAS DISCIPLINED AS FOCUSED. HILLARY CLINTON CAME ACROSS AS\nRATTLED AND UNHINGED. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY BELIEVED\nANYTHING SHE SAID. NOT ONLY TO REASSURE REPUBLICAN\nVOTERS, BUT TO BRING ALONG THE UNDECIDED AND I THINK OVER THE\nCOMING DAYS, YOU'LL SEE IT REFLECTED IN NEW POLLING POST\nDEBATE. >> BEFORE I LET YOU GO, SARAH,\nWY HEARD DONALD TRUMP TALK ABOUT THE IDEAS ABOUT THE COMMENTS HE\nMADE FROM THE AUDIO FROM SIMPLY LOCKER ROOM TALK.\nTHIS IS WHAT SHAWN DOLITTLE SAID.\nI'VE BEEN AN ATHLETE MY ENTIRE LIFE.\nDO YOU BELIEVE GROPING WOMEN IS WHAT MOST MEN DO?\n>> LOOK, THE BIGGER POINT HE MADE LAST NIGHT WHAT HE SAID WAS\nWRONG AND DIDN'T TRY TO DEFEND IT.\nHE SAID IT WAS WRONG. HE ADMITTED THAT.\nHE APOLOGIZED AND ASKED FOR FORGIVENESS.\nI THINK THAT WAS THE BIGGEST TAKE AWAY.\nTHAT'S WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE LOOKING FOR.\nI THINK THAT IT WOULD BE A REAL DISSERVICE TO THE AMERICAN\nPEOPLE IF WE SPENT THE NEXT 30 DAYS TALKING ABOUT NOTHING BUT\nTHIS, INSTEAD OF THE ISSUES THAT FRANKLY ARE KEEPING THEM UP AT\nNIGHT, THE ECONOMY, NATIONAL SECURITY, BORDER SECURITY.\nTHOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT DONALD TRUMP, WHEN WE GET TO TALK ABOUT\nREAL ISSUES THAT AMERICANS CARE ABOUT, THAT'S WHEN HE IS\nWINNING, AND SO IF WE CAN GET OFF OF THESE TANGENTS, WHICH I\nHOPE WE DO AND TALK ABOUT THE REAL ISSUES, WE'LL SEE THE POLLS\nTIGHTEN UP AND DONALD TRUMP WIN IN NOVEMBER.\n>> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, THANK",

MORE IMPORTANTLY, A TURN AROUND\nSTORY. VERY STRONG CEO AND YOU HAVE A\nFAIRLY NEW COO. TOGETHER, THIS TEAM, THEY HAVE\nBEEN IMPROVING THE PRODUCT. THEY HAVE BEEN IMPROVING THE\nPENETRATION AT STORE AND JUST BUILDING PARTNERSHIPS, BETTER\nRELATIONSHIPS WITH PARTNERSHIPS. THEY'RE BLOCK AND TACKLING.\nTHEY'RE FOCUSING ON COST CUTTING.\nI THINK 2017 SETS UP NICELY FOR POSITIVE OPERATING LEVERAGE YEAR\nWHERE YOU SEE AN ACCELERATION IN REVENUES AND BETTER MARGINS AND\nWHILE I WAIT, I GET A 5% DIVIDEND YIELD AND I LIKE THE\nRISK-REWARD HERE. >> STOCK IS UP 35% OVER THE LAST\nYEAR. >> YEAH, BUT DOWN 12% SINCE\nAPRIL.

I DON'T THINK THE DISTRIBUTION\nHERE IS OVER. SO I WOULD LOOK AT THAT GAP\nHIGHER FROM EARLIER THIS YEAR, 27, 28, MAYBE AS A SLIGHTLY\nBETTER ENTRY POINT. >> AND, YOU KNOW, I DON'T\nDISAGREE, JOSH. I'M NOT REALLY PLAYING IT FOR\nTHE THIRD QUARTER PER SE. SEASONALITY, THIS IS THE TIME\nWHEN YOU WANT TO OWN IT. THE ONLY 17 STORY AS THEIR NEW\nPRODUCTS REALLY GAIN TRACTION. AND THE REVENUE ACCELERATES FROM\n5% GROWTH TO 7% OR 8% AND GET THAT COST CUTTING STORY, SO YOU\nGET THAT LEVERAGE ON THE BOTTOM LINE.\nSO I KIND OF DEFER TO YOU ON THE SHORT-TERM, BUT LONG-TERM I'LL\nBE HAPPY BUYING IT HERE. >> I GOT A QUICK ONE FOR YOU.\nDO YOU LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE AN ACTIVISION.\nTHIS THING HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY ON FIRE.\nIS THAT A NAME THAT COMES ACROSS YOUR RADAR?\n>> SURE. WE ACTUALLY -- WE'RE BIG\nSHAREHOLDERS OF ACTIVISION. I FELT LIKE I MISSED IT TO BE\nHONEST WITH YOU.

              "text": ">>> WELCOME BACK TO TONIGHT'S\nMETHODS TO MADNESS SPECIAL WHERE I'M REVEALING SOME OF MY BEST\nTRICKS FOR BUYING AND SELLING STOCKS, TRULY TIMELESS INVESTING\nWISDOM FOR THE AGES, I HOPE. NEXT UP, HOW DO YOU FIND STOCKS\nTHAT ARE GREAT BUYS? EARLIER I WAS TALKING ABOUT\nPICKING OFF STOCKS THAT HAVE PULLED BACK FROM THE NEW HIGH\nLIST BECAUSE YOU GET A CHEAPER ENTRY POINT IN A STOCK THAT'S\nBEEN A PROVEN WINNER. I SAID YOU DIDN'T NECESSARILY\nWANT TO BUY NAMES RIGHT OFF THE NEW HIGH LIST BECAUSE YOU'RE\nPAYING TOO MUCH FOR THEM. YOU CAN USUALLY GET A BETTER\nDEAL IF YOU'RE PATIENT AND WAIT FOR SOME WEAKNESS, MAYBE DOWN\n5%, 7%. GIVEN HOW VOLATILE THE MARKET\nHAS BECOME, THERE ARE VERY FEW OCCASIONS WHEN BUYING A STOCK\nRIGHT OFF THE NEW HIGH LIST IS JUSTIFIED.\nSOMETIMES THE STOCK IS SO HOT, YOU GOT TO BUY IT WHENEVER YOU\nCAN BECAUSE IT MAY NOT BE GOING LOWER ANYTIME SOON.\nYOU WON'T FIND THESE OFTEN, BUT WHEN YOU FIND THEM, YOU HAVE TO\nREMEMBER NOT TO BUY ALL AT ONCE. IF YOU WANT TO BUY 100 SHARES OF\nSTOCK, YOU THINK IT'S GOT SO MUCH MOJO IT WOENGT GET A PULL\nBACK FROM THE HIGH, GO AHEAD AND BUY 25 SHARES.\nAND FIND ANOTHER STOCK. BELIEVE ME, THIS IS ALWAYS\nANOTHER STOCK TO FIND. I'VE GOT AN EXCEPTION WHERE IT'S\nOKAY TO BUY A STOCK RIGHT AROUND ITS HIGH.\nIF YOU SEE INSIDERS BUYING THE STOCK WHEN STOCK'S UP A LOT\nALREADY, I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A TOTAL GREEN LIGHT.\nNOW, IT IS A RARE THING TO SEE HAPPEN, BUT IN MY EXPERIENCE,\nIT'S RARER STILL THAT THIS METHOD OF PICKING STOCKS DOESN'T\nWORK OUT. SEE, I LOVE IT WHEN INSIDERS BUY\nAFTER A DECENT RUN BECAUSE THAT'S A GREAT SIGN OF\nCONFIDENCE THAT THEY THINK THE RUN'S JUST BEGINNING OR THERE'S\nA BIG RUNWAY AHEAD AND THEY ARE SURE THAT IT'S LONG-LASTING.\nREMEMBER, YOU CAN'T FLIP A STOCK IMMEDIATELY IF YOU'RE AN INSIDER\nBUYER. YOU HAVE TO WAIT SIX MONTHS.\nGOVERNMENT TAKES AWAY THE GAINS OTHERWISE.\nIT'S THE LAW. SO THESE PEOPLE ARE SEEING\nTHINGS THEY LIKE THAT AREN'T GOING TO DISAPPEAR IN SIX\nMONTHS. IF ANYTHING, THEY HAVEN'T APPEAR\nYET. NORMALLY INSIDER BUYING RANGES\nFROM BEING MEANINGLESS TO A SMALL INSUFFICIENT REASON TO BUY\nA STOCK. A LOT OF TIMES THEY WANT TO GIVE\nTHE IMPRESSION OF CONFIDENCE, CREATE AN ILLUSION THEY'RE DOING\nBETTER THAN THEY REALLY ARE. INSIDERS ARE NOT STUPID.\nTHEY KNOW IF THEY'RE SEEN BUYING THEIR OWN STOCK, THE MARKET WILL\nSMILE UPON THEM, SO THEY PLAY THE SYSTEM.\nHEY, THAT'S FAIR. BUT IT MEANS WE IGNORE MOST TINY\nINSIDER BUYING BECAUSE IT COULD BE KIND OF FLIM FLAM.\nWE ALSO USED TO CALL IT PAINTING THE TAPE.\nKIND OF MAKES IT LOOK BETTER THAN IT IS.\nTHAT SAID, WHEN YOU GET TRULY COLOSSAL INSIDER BUYING, EVEN IF\nIT'S NOT AT THE HIGH, YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THE\nSTOCK IN QUESTION BECAUSE IT'S A PRETTY POWERFUL ENDORSEMENT WHEN\nTHE INSIDERS BUY A WHOLE LOT OF STOCK.\nIT'S REALLY THE VOLUME OF THE INSIDER BUYING THAT DECLARES ITS\nSINCERITY, BUT WE'RE ONLY FOCUSING ON ONE SORT OF INSIDER\nBUYING RIGHT NOW, STOCKS THAT HAVE BEEN RUNNING AND AREN'T HER\nRECEIVED AS HISTORICALLY CHEAP. THESE ARE NOT VALUE STOCKS.\nTHERE'S NOTHING MORE IGNORANT YET TELLING THAN WHEN AN INSIDER\nBACKS UP THE TRUCK FOR HIS OWN STOCK WHEN IT'S BEEN RUNNING AT\nA PRETTY GOOD CLIP. WE'RE SO DARN CONFIDENT IT WILL\nKEEP GOING HIGHER, THAT WE'RE GOING TO BUY SOME SHARES HAND\nOVER FIST RIGHT NOW. WE'RE NOT WAITING FOR A PULL\nBACK, NO. ARROGANT, SURE, BUT THIS IS\nBANKABLE HUBRIS, CORPORATE INSIDERS AREN'T FUELS WITH SOME\nNOTABLE EXCEPTIONS. IF THEIR STOCKS ARE ON A TEAR,\nLET'S ASSUME IF THEY'RE BUYING, THEY PROBABLY DO KNOW SOMETHING.\nNOT EVERYONE DESERVES THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT IN THIS\nBUSINESS. AFTER THE MARKET MELT DOWN AT\nTHE END OF 2008, I KNOW THAT I ALLOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT ALL\nCEOs AND EXECUTIVES FOR THAT MATTER ARE A BUNCH OF CREWS, FRAUDS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO GOT\nBURNED OWNING SAY THE OLD FANNIE MAE OR LEHMAN BROTHERS.\nTHAT'S THE WRONG LESSON TO DRAW FROM THE CRASH.\nHEALTHY SKEPTICISM IS ONE THING, A TOTAL UNWILLINGNESS TO BELIEVE\nIN ANYTHING POSITIVE IS SOMETHING ELSE ENTIRELY.\nYOU NEED TO BE WILLING TO EXTEND SOME MEASURE OF TRUST TO PEOPLE\nWHO OWN COMPANIES THAT YOU OWN SHARES IN.\nWHAT ELSE COULD BE GOING ON IN SPUR BUYING?\nWE'VE SEEN IT IN AIRLINES, RENTAL CARDS, ENTERTAINMENT.\nPERS THESE EXECUTIVES ARE BUYING STOCK BECAUSE THEY HEAR THE\nFOOTSTEPS. MAYBE THEY'VE BEEN CONTACTED BY\nSOME OTHER COMPANY AND TURNED THAT COMPANY DOWN.\nSPURT OVERTURES HAPPEN ALL THE TIME AND -- OF COURSE THEY HAVE\nTO DISCLOSE ANYTHING THAT'S A SERIOUS BID.\nBUT A LOT OF TIMES YOU JUST GET A PHONE CALL AND SAY NO, BYE.\nWELL, THEY DO THAT BECAUSE THE COMPANY IS WORTH MORE THAN THEY\nTHOUGHT. MAYBE THEY THINK THE COMPANY\nCOULD BE BROKEN UP LIKE THE OLD TIECO OR FORTUNE BRANDS OR GA\nNET. MAYBE THEY SEE THE ABILITY TO\nCREATE VALUE AND WANT IN ON IT THEMSELVES OR MAYBE THE STOCK\nHAS RUN JUST A BIT BUT THEY DON'T THINK THE RUN IS OVER\nBECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE HOW MUCH BETTER THE COMPANY WILL BE WHEN\nIT'S DIVVIED UP. FOR US, BUYING AFTER BIG RUNS\nCAN BE A BIT RECKLESS AND LAZY. MOST INVESTORS ARE SMART ENOUGH\nTO WAIT FOR A PULL BACK BEFORE THEY PULL THE TRIGGER.\nINSIDER BUYS AFTER ZEENT RUNS TELLS ME THESE GUYS DON'T THINK\nTHERE WILL BE A PULL BACK AND THERE'S NOTHING MORE BULLISH\nTHAN THAT. SURE I WANT TO WAIT FOR A PULL\nBACK, BUT THAT'S THE BEST OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS AND YOU USUALLY\nDON'T GET THAT SCENARIO. BOTTOM LINE, ONE MORE METHOD OF\nCRAMER'S MADNESS, WHEN YOU SEE INSIDER BUYING ON A STOCK THAT'S\nALREADY AT A SOLID RUN, YOU PROBABLY WANT TO BE BUYING TOO.\nBOB IN NEW YORK, BOB. >> Caller: JIM, STEELER BOOYAH\nTO YOU. >> STEELERS FROM NEW YORK, ALL\nRIGHT. WELL, WHY NOT?\nWHAT'S UP? >> Caller: JIM, I HAVE A\nQUESTION ABOUT INTEREST RATES. WHEN THE FED RAISES INTEREST\nRATES, GOOD COMPANIES WITH ATTRACTIVE DIVIDEND YIELDS AND\nGROWTH PROSPECTS SUDDENLY RAPIDLY GO OUT OF FAVOR.\nCAN YOU ADD SOME CLARITY TO WHY? >> WELL, BECAUSE PEOPLE\nEXTRAPOLATE, BOB. ONCE THEY SEE RATES START TO GO\nUP, THEY FIGURE THEY'RE GOING TO GO UP FOR A WHILE.\nIF THAT'S THE CASE THEY WANT TO GET OUT OF WHAT THEY PERCEIVE AS\nBEING A RISKY YIELD, WHICH IS A STOCK YIELD, AND GO INTO WHAT'S\nA CERTAINTY, WHICH IS A BOND YIELD.\nSO IT'S ALL RELATIVE BASIS. RICK IN CALIFORNIA, RICK.\n>> Caller: BOOYAH, JIM. >> BOOYAH, RICK.\n>> Caller: HOW DO I ADD TO A POSITION IF MY STOCK HASN'T GONE\nDOWN TO THE AVERAGE -- >> NO, YOU CAN'T.\nI'D SAY THE VAST MAJORITY, NOT JUST A FEW TIMES, NOT JUST THE\nMAJORITY, BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF TIMES, WE PAY UP ABOVE OUR\nBASIS. WELL, I GOT TO TELL YOU.\n>> SELL, SELL, SELL. >> YOU GOT THE PICTURE.\nREMEMBER, HERE'S ANOTHER METHOD TO MY MADNESS, WHEN YOU SEE\nINSIDER BUYING IN A STOCK THAT'S ALREADY AT A BIG RUN, THINK I\nMIGHT WANT TO BE BUYING HERE TOO.\nAFTER THE BREAK, I'LL TRY TO MAKE YOU EVEN MORE MONEY.",

HAVE YOU HAD ANY OF THE\n18-YEAR-OLD JAMISON'S? DON'T WASTE THAT ONE ON THE\nDIRTY LINOLEUM FLOOR. TONIGHT I'M IN A GREAT MOOD,\nMAYBE A MANIC MOOD EVEN. LET'S SAY I'M PRETTY DARN\nPRODUCTIVE WHEN I'M IN HIGH GEAR.\nSO REVVED THAT I'M REVEALING MANY SECRET METHODS TO MY\nMADNESS. PULL OUT A PEN AND PAPER.\nSTART JOTTING SOME THINGS DOWN BECAUSE IT COULD BE INCREDIBLY\nUSEFUL. I'M GIVING YOU SOME OF THE BEST\nWAYS I KNOW TO PICK STOCKS. I'M TEACHING YOU HOW TO INVEST\nIN TRADE LIKE CRAMER. IF NOT TO BE LIKE ME, BECAUSE\nI'VE GOT SOME EMOTIONAL THINGS COOKING HERE, BUT AT LEAST\nEMULATE ME. SO FAR I'VE GIFNG AWAY TWO OF\nTHE TOOLS I USED AT MY HEDGE FUND, STILL UTE FOR MY\nCHARITABLE TRUST, WHERE I PLAY WITH AN OPEN HAND, ALLOWING\nSUBSCRIBERS TO SEE ALL MY TRADES BEFORE THEY HAPPEN.\nI LOOK FOR STOCKS THAT HAVE PULLED BACK FROM THE NEW HIGH\nLIST. THAT'S NOT A REASON TO BUY IN\nITSELF, BUT IT'S A GREAT PLACE TO LOOK FOR POTENTIAL BUYS.\nAND I LIKE TO BUY STOCKS THAT HAVE HAD BIG RUNS AND YET STILL\nHAVE SUBSTANTIAL INSIDER BUYING BECAUSE IT SAYS THE PEOPLE\nRUNNING THE COMPANY REALLY BELIEVE THEIR STOCK HAS LEGS,\nAND IF THEY BELIEVE, THERE COULD BE A GOOD REASON FOR US TO\nBELIEVE TOO. BUT, AGAIN, THIS ALONE NOT\nENOUGH TO RECOMMEND A STOCK. YOU STILL NEED TO DO THE\nHOMEWORK, TO CHECK THE FUNDAMENTALS, TO MAKE SURE YOU\nLIKE THE STORY BEHIND THE COMPANY BEFORE YOU DIVE IN AND\nBUY. WHAT I'M TEACHING YOU TONIGHT\nARE REALLY WHAT I CALL TELLS. THAT'S RIGHT, THEY'RE TELLS.\nTHEY'RE SIGNALS THAT A STOCK MIGHT BE WORTH OWNING, THAT IT'S\nWORTH YOUR TIME AND EFFORT TO GO THROUGH THE BORING PROCESS OF\nREADING THROUGH THE CONFERENCE CALL TRANSCRIPTS AND QUARTERLY\nFILINGS. THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF STOCKS\nOUT THERE, AND ANY METHOD WE CAN USE TO NARROW DOWN THE ONES THAT\nMIGHT BE ATTRACTIVE IS A METHOD WORTH HAVEth.\nWE'VE TALKED ABOUT INSIDER BUYING AT THE HIGH AND WHILE I\nDON'T USUALLY USE INSIDER BUYING AS THE ONLY WAY TO DETERMINE\nWHETHER A STOCK HAS GOT IT GOING OR NOT, THERE'S ONE OTHER\nSCENARIO WHEREIN SIDER BUYING MAKES FOR AN INCREDIBLY BULLISH\nTELL. THAT'S WHEN A STOCK HAS A HEAVY\nSHORT POSITION, MEANING A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE HAVE BORROWED\nSHARES, SOLD THOSE SHARES, AND ARE NOW WAITING FOR THE STOCK TO\nGO LOWER BEFORE THEY BUY BACK THE SHARES, RETURN THEM TO THE\nBANK THEY BORROWED THEM FROM AND COLLECT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN\nTHE PRICE THEY SOLD IT FIRST AND THE PRICE THEY BOUGHT THE STOCK\nBACK LATER. HOPEFULLY THEY SOLD IT HIGH AND\nBOUGHT IT LOW. YOU CAN THINK OF SHORTING AS\nLIKE REGULAR INVESTING BUT IT'S IN REVERSE.\nWE TRY TO BUY LOW AND SELL HIGH. SHORTS JUST TURN THAT AROUND.\nTHEY SELL HIGH AND TRY TO BUY LOW.\nWHEN A STOCK HAS A LOT OF SHORTS IN A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE\nCONVICTION THE STOCK IS ULTIMATELY GOING LOWER.\nWHEN YOU'RE SHORT THE POTENTIAL DOWN SIDE IS INFINITE.\nWHEN YOU'RE LONG, THE STOCK STOPS LOSING MONEY AT ZERO.\nSHORTS LOSE MONEY WHEN STOCKS GO HIGHER AND HIGHER.\nTHERE'S NO LID. THE OTHER IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT\nSHORT SELLERS IS IF THERE'S A LOT OF THEM AND A STOCK ALL OF A\nSUDDEN GETS SOME GOOD NEWS, WE GET WHAT'S CALLED A SHORT\nSQUEEZE, AND IT SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE WHAT IT IS.\nIN ORDER TO BAIL OR CLOSE OUT THEIR POSITIONS, THE SHORTS HAVE\nTO BUY. THIS IS WHAT'S CALLED COVERING.\nWHEN A LOT OF SHORTS COVER AT THE SAME TIME IN A PANIC, THE\nSTOCK WILL SURGE BECAUSE WHAT YOU REALLY HAVE IS A LOT OF\nPEOPLE DESPERATE TO BUY THE STOCK, A LOT OF DEMAND.\nTHEY HAVE TO BUY UNLESS THEY WANT THEIR YEARS WIPED OUT AS SO\nMANY SHORT SELLERS HAD IN THE LAST FEW SWOONS WHEN THE MARKET\nREFUSED TO QUIT AND WENT RIGHT BACK UP AND THE SHORTS HADN'T\nCOVERED OR BOUGHT THE SHORTS. SO WHERE DOES INSIDER BUYING FIT\nINTO THE SHORT SELLING EQUATION? YOU HAVE A STOCK WITH A HIGH\nSHORT INTEREST. THAT'S A SIGN THAT MUCH OF THE\nFLOW HAS SOLD SHORT. THEN SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO RUN\nTHE COMPANY STARTS BUYING SHARES FOR THEMSELVES OR AN OUTSIZER\nLIKE COCA-COLA. SANTA FE WITH REGENERON TAKES\nMORE THAN A 10% STAKE INDICATES IT WANTS MORE.\nTHOSE WERE THREE SITUATIONS WHERE THE SHORTS KEPT SHORTING\nAND THEY GOT CRUSHED. THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE BUYING,\nNOT SHORTING. IT'S ALMOST LIKE DRAWING A LINE\nIN THE SAND. THEY SAY OUR STOCK GOES THIS LOW\nAND NO LOWER. THIS IS A COMBINATION OF INSIDER\nBUYING AND A STOCK THAT IS HEAVILY SHORTED, ONE THAT OFTEN\nLEADS TO A SHORT SQUEEZE THAT SEFRNTDS THE STOCKS MIGHT\nHIGHER. SHORTS ARE SMART, MUCH SMARTER\nFOR THE MOST PART I HAVE FOUND THAN WHAT WE CALL LONG SIDE\nINVESTORS, BUT THEY USUALLY DON'T KNOW MORE ABOUT A BUSINESS\nTHAN THE INSIDERS WHO RUN IT. IF A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SHORTING\nA STOCK AND MANAGEMENT IS BUYING IT IN SIZEABLE AMOUNTS, THEN YOU\nSHOULD START DOING SOME HOMEWORK, AND USUALLY YOU'RE\nGOING TO WANT TO SIDE WITH MANAGEMENT.\nAND THEN YOU CAN RIDE IT HIGHER AND HIGHER AND HIGHER IN TRUE\nJACKIE WILSON STYLE. I RAG THE SANTA FE AND COCA-COLA\nBOY AND MONSTER AS BEING INSIDE LIKE BUYS.\nTHE SHORTS PANIC AND PUT THE STOCKS HIGHER IN DESPERATION TO\nCOVER THEIR POSITIONS AND YOU MAKE MONEY.\nSIMILARLY -- THAT'S ANOTHER LINE IN THE SAND SITUATION WHERE\nMANAGEMENT IS CONTRADICTING THE SHORTS.\nCOMPAIES OFTEN REPURCHASE THEIR OWN SHARES.\nI TEACH YOU HOW TO IDENTIFY THE BOGUS BUY BACKS IN MY CHARITABLE\nTRUST BULLETINS AT ACTIONALERTSPLUS.COM THAT I\nISSUE MULTIPLE TIMES EACH DAY. A SUBSTANTIAL NEW BUY BACK IN\nTHE FACE OF SHORTS IS OFTEN A GOOD REASON TO TAKE A CLOSER\nLOOK AT THE STOCK. NOW, A NOTE OF CAUTION HERE.\nYOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL IN DEALING WITH A COMPANY THAT'S IN\nTHE CROSSHAIRS OF THE SHORTS, ESPECIALLY WHEN PEOPLE ARE\nNERVOUS AND THE MARKET IS IN BAD SHAPE.\nTHE SHORTS HAVE THE ABILITY TO WRECK THE STOCKS EVEN IF THE\nFUNDAMENTALS OF THE UNDERLYING COMPANY ARE FANTASTIC.\nTHESE DAYS THE SHORTS HAVE MORE FIRE POWER THAN EVER, I BELIEVE\nTHANKS IN PART TO AN SEC THAT NOW UNDER BOTH DEMOCRATS AND\nREPUBLICANS LOOKS THE OTHER WAY WHEN SHORTS RAID STOCKS WITH\nBOGUS STORIES ABOUT ACCOUNTING ISSUE AND MANAGEMENT BLUNDERS.\nPLUS, IT'S PRETTY EASY TO DO AS A STOCK OWNERS NO LONGER HAVE\nTHE BENEFIT OF RULES THAT SLOWED SHORT SELLING DOWN AND MADE IT\nHARDER TO CREATE BEAR RATES. RULES LIKE WAITING FOR WHAT WAS\nKNOWN AS AN UPTICK OR A HIGHER PRICE BEFORE YOU COULD SELL\nSHORT STOCK. THAT WAS A GOOD RULE THAT\nSOMEHOW THE GOVERNMENT TALKED INTO ABOLISHING IN ORDER TO MAKE\nTRADING QUICKER AND MORE FAIR FOR THE SHORTS.\nA LOT OF GOOD THAT DID FOR US. IT'S THE LEADING REASON WHY SO\nMANY HOME GAMERS HAVE LEFT THE BUILDING.\nWE ESTABLISHED THESE RULES IN ORDER TO STOP THE FOMENTING OF\nPANIC, SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED DURING THE GREAT DEPRESSION, BUT\nTHE GOVERNMENT IN ALL OF ITS WISDOM SEEMS TO THINK THE PANICS\nARE NO LONGER POSSIBLE. SO WE HAVE TO BE MORE CAREFUL\nTHAN EVER NOT TO SUCCUMB TO PANIC.\nTHAT'S BEEN ORCHESTRATED BY SHORT SELLERS.\nWITHOUT PROTECTION, THE SHORTS WERE ABLE TO RUN WILD AND\nPRACTICALLY ASSASSINATE THE STOCKS OF MANY FINANCIAL\nCOMPANIES DURING THE CRASH OF 2008 UIL THE GENERATIONAL\nBOTTOM IN MARCH OF 2009 PUT THE BULLS BACK IN CONTROL.\nBUT THE SHORTS CAME BACK WITH AGGRESSIVE NEGATIVITY AFTER MANY\nOF THE BIG RUNS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS, THIS TIME USING METHODS\nOF MASS DESTRUCTION LIKE DOUBLE AND TRIPLE ETFs.\nWHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH A HEAVILY SHORTED STOCK, YOU HAVE\nTO LEARN TO TREAD CAREFULLY. YOU CAN STILL FIND GREAT\nOPPORTUNITIES IN STOCKS WHERE THE SHORTS HAVE OVERREACHED AND\nTHE INSIDERS ARE BUYING, BUT BEFORE GOING INTO ONE OF THESE\nSITUATIONS, I HAVE TO WARN YOU THAT THE BALANCE OF POWER HAS\nSHIFTED IN RECENT YEARS IN FAVOR OF THE SHORTS AGAINST REGULAR\nINDIVIDUAL INVESTORS. THAT MEANS EVEN IF THE SHORT\nSELLERS ARE WRONG SHORT TERM ABOUT A COMPANY'S PROSPECT OR\nEVEN LONG TERM, THEY CAN STILL DEMOLISH THE STOCK, ESPECIALLY\nIF THEY MOUNT CAMPAIGNS AGAINST THE STOCK LIKE WITH HERBAL LIFE\nAND BILL ACMAN. THE HEDGE FUND MANAGER WAS\nTAKING ON THE COMPANY. JUST DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE\nAMOUNT OF DAMAGE THE SHORTS CAN DO.\nALTHOUGH REMEMBER THE BEST PROTECTION AGAINST THESE RAIDS\nIS OFFER FROM STOCKS THAT PAY GOOD SOLID DIVIDENDS.\nSHORT SELLERS HAVE TO BORROW STOCK TO SHORT THE STOCK, AND\nTHAT MEANS THEY HAVE TO PAY THE DIVIDENDS TO THE REAL OWNERS.\nTHAT'S A TERRIFIC DETERRENT FOR THOSE WHO ARE PERNICIOUS IN THE\nWAY THEY GO ABOUT SHORTING. WHEN YOU SEE A STOCK WITH A BIG\nDIVIDEND THAT'S BEING ATTACKED BY SHORTS AND THE DIVIDEND IS\nGOING HIGHER, WHAT A TERRIFIC PLACE TO BE, ESPECIALLY IF THE\nINSIDERS ARE SNAPPING UP STOCKS TOO.\nINSIDER BUYING PLUS HEAVY SHORT INTEREST CAN EQUAL RAGING BUY AS\nLONG AS YOU AVOID SITUATIONS WHERE THE SHORTS ARE DETERMINED\nTO CRUSH THE STOCK AT ANY COST. THINK HERBAL LIFE.\nSPEAKING OF HERBAL LIFE, LET'S GO TO HERB IN FLORIDA, HERB.\n>> Caller: JIM, GREAT TO TALK TO YOU.\nI'M AN ACTION ALERTS FOLLOWER FOR AT PAST FEW YEARS.\nI WISH I HAD GOTTEN ON BOARD A LOT SOONER.\n>> YOU'RE VERY KIND. SOME TOUGH DAYS.\nTHANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING US. WHAT'S GOING ON?\n>> Caller: I'M RECENTLY RETIRED. I'VE SAVED UP WELL OVER MY\nLIFETIME, AND I'VE LOOKED AT WHAT THE LONGEVITY OF MY\nSAVINGS.

YOU'RE DOING IT EXACTLY RIGHT,\nJUST LIKE WE TEACH YOU IN ACTION ALERTS.\n>> Caller: WELL, I'VE BEEN PAYING ATTENTION, THEN.\n>> THANK YOU. >> Caller: THANK YOU.\n>> YOU'VE GOT IT DEAD RIGHT. YOU'RE DOING EXACTLY WHAT I\nLIKE. I HAVE NO CRITICISMS.\nALL RIGHT. TRYING TO SPOT A RAGING BUY?\nHERE'S A TIP, WHEN YOU SEE ING SIDER BUYING PLUS HEAVY SHORT\nINTEREST AND THEN A BUY BACK AND A DIVIDEND, WOW, YOU GOT\nSOMETHING. JUST BE CAREFUL TO AVOID\nSITUATIONS WHERE THE SHORTS ARE SIMPLY DETERMINED NO MATTER WHAT\nTO CRUSH NOT JUST THE STOCK, BUT THE BUSINESS ITSELF.\nSTICK WITH CRAMER.",

THIS SHOW HAS ADJUSTED OVER\nTIME. IT'S TERM\nINVEST, NOT TRADING. IF YOU WATCH IT ANYTIME IN THE\nLAST FIVE YEARS, YOU KNOW THAT. HOWEVER, KNOWING HOW TO TRADE\nCAN MAKE YOU A BETTER INVESTOR, AND TRADING ABOUT A CORE\nPOSITION IS ONE OF THE MOST BASIC AND USEFUL DISCIPLINES OUT\nTHERE. MANY PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ME WHAT\nDO I MEAN BY IT? WELL, IN MARKETS LIKE THIS ONE\nWHEN THERE ARE PERIODIC SWOONS AFTER BIG RUNS, IT DOES HELP TO\nTRADE AROUND. WHAT'S IT MEAN TO TRADE AROUND A\nCORE POSITION? LET'S GO THROUGH IT STEP BY\nSTEP. FIRST YOU NEED A STOCK.\nPICK ONE THAT YOU LIKE, ONE YOU'VE GOT AN OPINION ON, ONE\nTHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO BUY AS IT GOES DOWN.\nFINDING A STOCK THAT YOU BELIEVE WILL BE GOING HIGHER OVER THE\nLONG TERM IS WHAT MATTERS EVEN AS YOU ACCEPT THE FACT IT COULD\nGO DOWN IN THE NEAR TERM. WHAT YOU'RE REALLY LOOKING FOR\nIS A GREAT COMPANY WITH A STOCK THAT COULD GET TOSSED AROUND BY\nMARKET VOLATILITY BUT THAT YOU ULTIMATELY BELIEVE WILL GET\nHIGHER IF YOU'RE PATIENT. SO IF YOU WERE JUST INVESTING,\nYOU'D SET UP A POSITION IN THE STOCK, BUYING IN INCREMENTS\nBECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THAT BUYING ALL AT ONCE IS ARROGANCE, AND\nTHAT'S NOT GOING TO BE ALLOWED ON \"MAD MONEY.\"\nWHY DON'T WE USE GOOGLE AS AN EXAMPLE BECAUSE I LIKE THAT\nSTOCK VERY MUCH, HAVE SINCE IT BECAME PUBLIC.\nALTHOUGH ONLY OVER THE LONG TERM WILL I TELL YOU I LIKE IT\nBECAUSE IT'S VERY VOLATILE DURING THE SHORT TERM.\nLET'S SAY YOU WANT TO OWN 100 SHARES OF GOOGLE OVER TIME, THE\nWAY TO SET UP THAT POSITION WOULD BE TO BUY 25 SHARES FOUR\nTIMES OVER A PERIOD OF WEEKS OR EVEN MONTHS.\nLET'S SAY YOU WANT TO TRADE. I KNOW MANY OF YOU WANT TO BUT\nYOU FEEL DISCOURAGED BECAUSE YOU REMEMBER HOW ALL THE AMATEUR DAY\nTRADERS GOT BLOWN OUT WHEN THE TECH BUBBLE BURST.\nTHE KEY WORD WAS AMATEUR. YOU HOME GAMERS CAN MAKE MONEY\nTRADING IF YOU DO IT RIGHT LIKE A PROFESSIONAL.\nIN THE OLD DAYS WHEN COMMISSIONS WERE HIGHER, THAT WASN'T TRUE.\nTHE COMMISSIONS WOULD EAT INTO YOUR PROFITS AND IT WASN'T WORTH\nWHILE TO TRADE. THAT HASN'T BEEN THE CASE FOR\nAGES. LET'S COME BACK TO OUR CORE LONG\nTERM POSITION STRATEGY. WE OWN 1 HURN SHARES OF GOOGLE\nAND WE WANT TO OWN IT LONG TERM. LET'S SAY IT'S TRADING AT $500 A\nSHARE. EVERY TIME THE STOCK JUMPS 25\nPOINTS, OR 5%, IF YOU WANT TO TRADE AROUND POSITION TO\nPRESERVE CAPITAL, YOU MIGHT WANT TO SELL 25 SHARES.\nYOU SAVE A LITTLE OFF TO BRING IN SOME PROFITS.\nONCE GOOGLE REACHES 525, YOU WOULD OWN 75 SHARES.\nYOU KEEP SCALING OUT THE SAME WAY ALTHOUGH ALWAYS I LOVE THE\nSTOCK. I WOULD LIKE TO KEEP THAT LAST\n25 SHARES. THEN YOU WAIT UNTIL SOMETHING\nHAPPENS TO KNOCK THE STOCK DOWN TO WHERE YOU BOUGHT IT AS LONG\nAS THE NEWS ISN'T SPECIFIC TO GOOGLE, THERE BY DAMAGING\nGOOGLE'S PROSPECTS. IT SHOULDN'T BE UNREASONABLE\nGIVEN WE'RE IN A WORLD THAT STOCK CAN GET CRUSHED BY ALL\nFACTORS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FUNDAMENTALS.\nAS THE STOCK COMES DOWN, YOU BUY IT BACK IN INCREMENTS.\nLET'S KEEP USING INCREMENTS OF 25.\nIF GOOGLE COMES BACK TO 500 FROM 575, YOU BUY 25 SHARES.\nYOU COULD EVEN TAKE YOUR WINNINGS THIS WAY AND HELP BUY\n25 MORE IF IT CAMS GOING LOWER, AND YOU ONLY GOT TO SWELL 25\nBEFORE THE SWOON. THIS MIGHT APPEAR TO BE SMALL\nPOTATOES, UP 5% TO SHARE 25 SHARES, AND REPEAT THE PROCESS\nUP ON THE WAY BACK. BUT OVER TIME, YOUR PROFITS CAN\nADD UP. REMEMBER, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO\nANYTHING. YOU CAN JUST HOLD IT.\nTHAT IS FINE WITH ME. BUT PEOPLE ASK ME WHAT TRADING\nAROUND THE CORE POSITION AND THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE THINK TRADING IS INCREDIBLY EXCITING, AND IT CAN\nBE. BUT IF YOU'RE GOOD AT TRADING\nAROUND A CORE POSITION, IT'S RIGHT TO BE BORED.\nTHERE'S NOTHING EXCITING ABOUT THE PLAN I JUST LAID OUT.\nALL YOU'RE DOING IS WATCH THE STOCK MOVE, TRIMMING UP OR\nADDING TO YOUR POSITION. CONJURE THE IMAGE OF TRADING AS\nSOMETHING RECKLESS AND IRRESPONSIBLE.\nTRADING AROUND A CORE POSITION IS THE HEIGHT OF PRUDENT.\nOF COURSE THIS WHOLE TRADING AROUND THE CORE POSITION TACTIC\nWORKS BEST WITH STOCKS AT LOWER PRICES WHERE YOU CAN BUY MORE\nSTOCK AND HAVE MORE ROOM TO BUY MORE.\nBUT I WANTED TO SHOW YOU THAT IT CAN WORK EVEN WITH GOOGLE, WITH\nA $500 STOCK. AGAIN, IF YOU OWN A STOCK AND\nYOU LIKE IT, YOU DON'T NEED TO DO ANYTHING.\nTHIS IS IN RESPONSE TO MANY QUESTIONS ON TWITTER AND IN MY\nCAREER ABOUT HOW I USED TO TRADE WHEN I WAS AT MY HEDGE FUND.\nTRADING AROUND A CORE. OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN SCALE THESE\nNUMBERS DEPENDING ON HOW BIG YOUR POSITION.\nTHE BASIC IDEA IS TO AVOID PUTTING YOURSELF IN A SPOT WHERE\nYOU HAVE TOO MUCH ON THE TABLE IN CASE THE STOCK GETS\nS.W.A.T.ED DOWN OR TOO LITTLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ANY UPSIDE.\nTRADES AROUND THE CORE IS A  CAN USE, EVEN THOSE OF YOU WHO\nFIND THE NOTION OF TRADING AS OPPOSED TO INVESTING TO BE\nABHORRENT. IF YOU WANT TO TAKE YOUR TRADING\nTO THE ULTIMATE LEVEL, I RECOMMEND YOU READ TWO CHAPTERS\nON ODD AND GETTING BACK TO EVEN. I USED TO THINK BEFORE OPTIONS\nACTION, THE TV PROGRAM, THAT SOME OF THIS MATERIAL WAS TOO\nSOPHISTICATED FOR TV. I NO LONGER THINK THAT, AND YOU\nHAVE TO BE WILLING TO PUT IN SOME EXTRA HOMEWORK, BUT IF YOU\nHAVE THE TIME AND INCLINATION, IT'S MORE THAN WORTH THE EFFORT.\nTHE STOCK I USED TO DEMONSTRATE IT HAPPENS TO BE GOOGLE, AND YOU\nCAN E HOW MY STRATEGY OF WHAT I CALL STOCK REPLACEMENT AND\nGETTING BACK TO EVEN WORKS BETTER WITH OPTIONS THAN WITH\nTHE COMMON STOCK. IT'S KIND OF LIKE A CHEAPER AND\nLESS RISKY WAY TO WHAT I CALL CREATING A GOOGLE AT A MORE\nREASONABLE DOLLAR AMOUNT PRICE THAN IT CURRENTLY SELLS AT.\nTHIS STUFF IS HARD. BUT I AM REACTING TO THE\nREQUESTS I GET ALL THE TIME AT TWITTER AS MANY WANT TO KNOW\nABOUT THE OPTION STRATEGIES I FAVOR.\nWE CAN'T USE OPTIONS FOR ACTION ALERTS PLUS.COM SO I'M OLD TIME\nON THIS STUFF. BY THE WAY, IF YOU DON'T\nUNDERSTAND OPTIONS AT ALL, LET ALONE THE SOPHISTICATED\nSTRATEGIES I LAY OUT IN GETTING BACK TO EVEN, IN MY FIRST\nHANDBOOK, REAL MONEY, THAT'S A HANDBOOK OF WHAT I TAUGHT PEOPLE\nWHO WENT TO WORK AT MY HEDGE FUND, I HAVE WHAT AN OPTION IS.\nBOTTOM LINE. NOW, YOU KNOW THE BASICS OF HOW\nTO TRADE AROUND A CORE POSITION IF YOU'RE SO INCLINED.\nYET ANOTHER METHOD TO MY MADNESS, ONE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO\nGENERATE LOTS OF SMALL GAINS THAT ADD UP OVER TIME.\nDON'T NEED TO DO IT, BUT NOW YOU KNOW HOW.\nSTAY WITH CRAMER.",

THIS IS A QUESTION THAT NEEDS TO\nBE ANSWERED BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY TO BE MADE OWNING\nHOT STOCKS WITH LOTS OF MOMENTUM.\nBUT WHEN YOU PLAY THE MOMENTUM GAME, YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHEN IT'S\nTIME TO LEAVE THE TABLE. THAT'S WHAT'S CRUCIAL.\nTHERE ARE ALWAYS NAYSAYERS, AND EVENTUALLY THE NAYSAYERS ARE\nALMOST ALWAYS PROVEN RIGHT SOONER OR LATER ALL HOT STOCKS\nIMPLODE EXCEPT FOR THE ONES THAT OVER TIME ARE ABLE TO DEVELOP\nINTO MULTIPLE BUSINESS STREAMS. THIS TOPPING PROCESS HAPPENED\nBIG IN RECENT YEARS WITH STOCKS AS DIVERSE AS CHIPOTLE OR\nSMALLER BIOTECH STOCKS. THEY KEPT BLOWING UP.\nBUT IT USUALLY OCCURS LATER RATHER THAN SOONER AND ALL\nNEGATIVE TALKING HEADS THAT KEPT YOU OUT WITH THEIR RECKLESSNESS\nACTUALLY COST YOU GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE MONEY.\nPEOPLE SHY AWAY FROM THESE STOCKS BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW\nWHERE THEY'RE GOING TO TOP OUT. THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.\nI'D BE AFRAID TO BUY THEM TOO IF I DIDN'T HAVE A DISCIPLINE THAT\nLET ME KNOW WHEN TO GET OUT. LUCKY FOR YOU I DO HAVE ONE, AND\nYOU'RE ABOUT TO LEARN IT. FIRST WHEN I'M TALKING ABOUT HOT\nSTOCKS, I REALLY MEAN HOT SPECULATIVE STOCKS.\nUSUALLY THESE STOCKS BEGIN WITH VERY LITTLE RESEARCH COVERAGE\nFROM THE MAJOR WALL STREET BROKERAGE HOUSES.\nTHESE NAMES CAN GO UP FOR A VERY LONG TIME.\nTHEY CAN CATCH FIRE AND STAY ON FIRE FOR YEARS WITHOUT\nSPONSORSHIP. THE KEY TO FIGURING OUT WHEN\nIT'S SOMETIME TO SELL IS BY WATCHING THE ANALYST COVERAGE\nBEING ROLLED OUT. A GOOD RULE OF THUMB IS ONCE ONE\nOF THESE HOT STOCKS GETS DISCOVERED AND THEN HAS AT LEAST\nA HALF DOZEN ANALYSTS, SIX ANALYSTS COVERING IT, THEN THE\nRUN IS GOING TO BEGIN TO PETER OUT, NOT GET STRONGER BECAUSE IT\nIS GOING TO BE TOO BIG AND TOO WELL KNOWN TO CONTINUE TO GO UP\nTHE WAY IT HAS. IT'S THE RARE STOCK THAT DOESN'T\nBEHAVE THIS WAY. YOU CAN FIND OUT HOW MANY GUYS\nOWN A STOCK BY LOOKING AT IT ANYWHERE ON THE INTERNET.\nTHIS ISN'T HARD TO FIND INFORMATION.\nIT WAS AT ONE TIME, NOT ANYMORE. THIS FORMULA HAS WORKED FOR ME\nFOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER. AS FAR AS I CAN TELL, IT WORKS\nBECAUSE THE NUMBER OF ANALYSTS ON A STOCK IS A GOOD GAUGE OF\nHOW MUCH AWARENESS AND INTEREST THERE IS IN A NAME, AND NAMES\nDON'T GET HOT FOLLOWED AND PUSHED BY EVERYBODY.\nTHEY GET HOT BECAUSE THEY GET DISCOVERED BY EVERYBODY.\nHOT STOCKS GET TAPPED OUT WHEN THERE'S NOBODY LEFT TO BE\nATTRACTED TO THEM, WHEN ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE INTERESTED\nIN BUYING THEM HAVE ALREADY BOUGHT.\nTHEY CAME OUT OF NOWHERE, ATTRACTING MORE AND MORE\nATTENTION, MORE AND MORE BACKERS, AND EVENTUALLY EVERYONE\nWHO WANTS A PIECE OF THE STOCK HAS A PIECE OF IT.\nWHEN THAT HAPPENS, THE RUN IS OVER, PEOPLE, AND THEN YOU MUST\nRING THE REGISTER AND GO HOME. LET ME GIVE YOU A GREAT EXAMPLE.\nHANSEN NATURAL, THE OLD MONSTER BEVERAGE.\nTHAT WAS THE NAME IT USED TO BE, WHICH WAS ONE OF THE HOTTEST\nSTOCKS IN 2004. HANSEN WENT FROM $18 IN CHANGE\nAT THE BEGINNING OF 2005, TO $200 WHEN IT PEAKED IN JULY OF\n2006. THE WHOLE WAY UP, THERE WERE\nPEOPLE TELLING YOU THAT HANSEN, A BEVERAGE COMPANY THAT GOT ITS\nMOMENTUM FROM ITS MONSTER ENERGY DRINK, WAS A FAD, HAD TO DRY\nOUT, HAD TO CRASH. WELL, IT DID DO THAT, BUT AS\nOFTEN IS THE CASE, IT TOOK YEARS FOR THE MOMENTUM TO RUN OUT, NOT\nDAYS, NOT MONTHS, NOT WEEKS -- YEARS.\nI CALLED THE TOP IN HANSEN BACK THEN BECAUSE I KNOW HOW THESE\nSTOCKS WORKED. IT PEAKED IN JULY OF 2006 IN\nPART BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THE COMPANY DID A FIVE FOR ONE\nSPLIT, AND EVEN THOUGH SPLITS AREN'T SUPPOSED TO DO ANYTHING,\nTHIS ENCOURAGED PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN IN HANSEN FOR A LONG TIME\nTO TAKE SOMETHING OFF THE TABLE. BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER REASON I\nBELIEVED IT WOULD PEAK, AND THAT WAS IT PICKED UP ITS FOURTH IN\nWHEN GOLDMAN SACHS STARTED GOVERNING IT.\nYOU HAD TWO MONTHS TO SELL BECAUSE GOLD MAN'S\nINITIATEIATION AND THE STOCK'S PEAK.\nPRUNSZ DICTATED THAT WE SELL ONCE THE STOCK HAD FOUR ANALYSTS\nON IT. BETTER TO CLEAR OUT EARLY WITH\nYOUR WINNINGS THAN WAIT FOR THEM TO FADE AWAY.\nAND HANSEN, AS WITH PRETTY MUCH ALL OF THE OTHER STOCKS, HOT\nSTOCKS STARTED TO COOL OFF ONCE IT HIT THAT CRITICAL MASS OF\nANALYST COVERAGE. ONCE IT FELL OFF THE RADAR\nSCREEN, PEOPLE STOPPED TALKING ABOUT IT AND ANALYST COVERAGE\nDWINDLED AGAIN, THE STOCK RECHARGED, AND ULTIMATELY\nCOCA-COLA BOUGHT A HUGE STAKE IN ITS EQUITY, WHICH SENT IT UP\nEVEN FURTHER. IT WAS REALLY A TESTAMENT WHEN\nANALYSTS STOP FOLLOWING A COMPANY OR DO SO ON A DESUL TORY\nBASIS, THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS START -- IT TURNS OUT THAT THE\nFAD DRINK ENDED UP VANQUISHING THE COMPANY FROM MAJOR SEW ZA\nBRANDS THAT FAILED TO MATERIALIZE AND ULTIMATELY THE\nBIGGEST ONE JOINED IT RATHER THAN KEEP FIGHTING IT.\nBUT AGAIN AS ANALYST COVERAGE GAINED, THERE'S SO MANY ANALYSTS\nSTARTED COVERING IT, THE STOCK PEAKED.\nWHEN THEY DROPPED IT, THE STOCK BOTTOMED.\nTHAT'S HOW IT WORKS. SMALL SPECULATIVE, STEAMY HOT\nMOMENTUM STOCKS ARE OFTEN WORTH OWNING, BUT YOU MOST KNOW WHEN\nTO SELL AND THAT MOMENT COMES WHEN YOU SEE TOO MANY ANALYSTS\nJUMPING ON THE BANDWAGON. USE FOUR AS A GOOD RULE OF THUMB\nLETTING YOU KNOW WHEN TO START SELLING.\nSTAY WITH CRAMER.                \u00e2\u0099\u00aa",

ARE YOU GOING TO TWEET TALK US?\n>> NO. I AM NOT.\nBUT THIS ESSENTIALLY COMES DOWN TO A COUPLE OF TWEETS FROM ELON\nMUSK OVER THE WEEKEND. AND BASICALLY COMES DOWN TO\nTHIS. THE FIRST ONE THAT IS GETTING A\nLOT OF ATTENTION, ON WALL STREET, IS ELON MUSK SAYING THAT\nESSENTIALLY TESLA AND SOLAR CITY WILL NOT BE NEEDING TO DO A\nCAPITAL RAISE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AS MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN\nEXPECTING. PROBABLY NOT FIRST QUARTER\nEITHER, WHICH THEN BRINGS UP THE QUESTION, WELL, IS TESLA GOING\nTO HAVE ENOUGH CASH TO GET THROUGH THE END OF THIS YEAR AND\nTHEN INTO NEXT YEAR. TAKE A LOOK AT THE NUMBERS AS OF\nTHE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER, IT WAS SITTING ON $3.2 BILLION,\nWE OUTLINED SOME OF THE EXPENDITURES THAT TESLA WILL\nFACE THROUGH THE SECOND HALF THAT WE KNOW OF.\nWE'RE STILL WAITING ON THIRD QUARTER NUMBERS.\nTHE CASH CUSHION AT THE END OF THE THIRD OR FOURTH QUARTER IS\nLIKELY TO BE AROUND $400 MILLION.\nTHAT'S AN ESTIMATE AT THIS POINT.\nFOR TESLA, THE COSTS ARE KNOWN. THEY'RE INCREASING VEHICLE\nPRODUCTION, BATTERY PRODUCTION WITH THE GIGA FACTORY.\nTHOSE ARE THE EXPENDITURES OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL QUARTERS.\nALSO INVESTING AHEAD OF THE LAUNCH OF THE MODEL THREE.\nAND THAT'S EXPECTED TO HAPPEN IN THE SECOND HALF OF NEXT YEAR.\nSPEAKING OF THE MODEL THREE, THE NEXT VEHICLE COMING FROM TESLA,\nANOTHER TWEET FROM ELON MUSK GETTING SOME ATTENTION IS THAT\nTHERE WILL BE A NEW PRODUCT THAT THEY WILL UNVEIL FROM TESLA NEXT\nWEEK. THE KEY WORD HERE, PRODUCT.\nDOESN'T MEAN IT IS A MODEL. IT COULD BE AN ELEMENT OF A\nVEHICLE, WHETHER IT IS DRIVER ASSISTANCE SYSTEM, WHETHER IT IS\nSOME OTHER TYPE OF PRODUCT THAT GOES ALONG WITH TESLA.\nBUT ANYTIME ELON MUSK SAYS THERE IS A NEW ONE UNEXPECTED BY MOST,\nIT IS GOING TO GET A LOT OF ATTENTION.\nDON'T FORGET, TESLA REPORTS EARNINGS LATER THIS MONTH.\nTHE 26th OF OCTOBER. THAT'S WHEN WE'LL FIND OUT HOW\nTHEY DID IN THE THIRD QUARTER. >> PRODUCT CAN ALSO EQUAL\nSOFTWARE, PHIL? THAT'S NOT THAT EXCITING.\n>> SURE. >> OKAY.\n>> AND MELISSA, TO THAT POINT, THERE HAVE BEEN PEOPLE WHO SAID\nWHETHER IS A PRODUCT, THEY RELEASE -- YOU GOT TO TAKE THESE\nWITH A GRAIN OF SALT UNTIL YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE.\n>> PHIL, STICK WITH US. LET'S TALK TESLA WITH COLIN\nRUSH. GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US.\nI WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENT.\nDO YOU THINK IT IS GOING TO BE -- COULD IT BE A NEW CAR?\n>> NO, WE DON'T THINK SO. WITH THIS SORT OF LEAD TIME, WE\nTHINK IT IS PROBABLY AN INCREMENTAL REFINEMENT OF SOME\nOF THE EXISTING PRODUCTS OR EVOLUTION OF WHAT THEY HAVE\nALREADY OFFERED TO THE MARKET. THEY TYPICALLY WITH A BIGGER\nPRODUCT LAUNCH WOULD DO A VERY BIG MEDIA PREP AND PLENTY OF\nLEAD TIME TO MAKE SURE THERE WAS ENOUGH ATTENTION FOCUSED ON A\nMAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT. WE THINK THIS WILL BE A MINOR\nANNOUNCEMENT. >> LET'S GET TO WHAT IS MOVING\nTHE STOCK, THAT IS THE NOTION THAT TESLA WON'T HAVE TO RAISE\nFUNDS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, EVEN FIRST QUARTER OF NEXT YEAR.\nPHIL OUTLINED IN DETAIL THAT IT WOULD LEAVE THE COMPANY WITH A\n$400 MILLION CASH CUSHION. IS THAT ENOUGH?\n>> WELL, WHAT WE HAVE SEEN THEM DO IS DO SOME ASSET BACKED\nFINANCING AT SOLAR CITY AS WELL AS WITH THE TESLA INVENTORIES,\nWE THINK THEY'LL CONTINUE TO DO THAT ALONG WITH EXPANDING THE\nLEASE PROGRAM WITH THE MODEL S AND MODEL X.\nAS WE GO FORWARD, THAT'S GOING TO EASE THEIR CASH NEEDS, BUT\nTHEY WILL NEED TO RAISE CAPITAL NEXT YEAR AT THE VERY LATEST TO\nBUILD OUT THE CAP X FOR THE MODEL THREE.\n>> TAX CREDITS ARE SO IMPORTANT TO THIS COMPANY.\nIS THERE ANY POLITICAL RISK AND I KNOW YOU PROBABLY DON'T WANT\nTO DIVE INTO THE POLITICAL WORLD, BUT YOU DO YOUR ANALYSIS,\nIS THERE ANY RISK OF ANY OF THE CREDITS THAT REALLY DO HELP\nTESLA RIGHT NOW GOING AWAY UNDER ANY SCENARIO?\n>> WE'RE HAPPY TO GO INTO POLITICS.\nIT HAS BEEN A CORNERSTONE OF OUR RESEARCH FRANCHISE.\nAND AS WE LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON WITH SOLAR CITY, CERTAINLY\nTHE SOLAR TAX CREDIT IN THE U.S. ARE VERY MUCH IN STONE THROUGH\n2022. WE'RE NOT CONCERNED ABOUT THAT\nAT ALL. IN TERMS OF THE ZERO EMISSIONS\nVEHICLE CREDITS, IN GENERAL, YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT PART OF OUR\nPLANNING MODEL FOR TESLA, SO IT IS NOT A CONCERN FOR US AS WE\nMODEL OUT THE COMPANY GOING FORWARD.\nIT IS NICE TO HAVE IN A BONUS IF IT STAYS IN TACT WHERE IT IS\nRIGHT NOW. >> COLIN THIS IS PHIL LeBEAU.\nYOU OUTLINED THE FACT YOU THINK THEY CAN CONSERVE THEIR CASH TO\nA CERTAIN EXTENT FOR THE REMAINDER OF THIS YEAR AND THE\nFIRST QUARTER, IF THEY WERE AS JUDICIOUS AS POSSIBLE DOING\nTHAT, AT SOME POINT YOU BELIEVE THEY WILL NEED TO RAISE CAPITAL.\nWHEN WOULD YOU EXPECT AT THE VERY FURTHEST OUT WHERE THEY\nWOULD HAVE TO SAY, YES, WE DO NEED TO GO TO THE CAPITAL\nMARKETS? >> IT WOULD BE 2Q.\nI THINK THERE WOULD BE PRUDENCE TO RAISE CAPITAL SOONER.\nHAVING AN EXTRA CASH CUSHION MAKES SENSE US TO.\nI THINK STRETCHING THAT OUT IS PARTIALLY JUST TO ALLAY SOME\nFEARS AROUND THE SOLAR CITY ACQUISITION AND WHAT THAT IS\nGOING TO DO TO THE TESLA BALANCE SHEET AND I THINK THE POINT THAT\nTHEY GET THAT DONE, I THINK WE'LL COME BACK AND HEAR\nSOMETHING MORE FROM THE TESLA MANAGEMENT TEAM.\n>> COLIN, WE'LL LEAVE IT THERE. THANKS SO MUCH.\nCOLIN RUSH AND TO OUR OWN PHIL LeBEAU AS WELL.\n>> STILL AHEAD -- >> SOMEONE WITH THE TEMPERAMENT\nOF DONALD TRUMP IS NOT IN CHARGE OF THE LAW IN OUR COUNTRY.\n>> BECAUSE YOU'LL BE IN JAIL. >> SECRETARY CLINTON --\n>> THERE WERE PLENTY OF VERBAL JABS AT LAST NIGHT'S DEBATE, BUT\nTHE NONVERBAL ONES SPOKE VOLUMES TOO.\nWHAT THE CANDIDATES DIDN'T SAY, BUT DO THAT HAS EVERYONE\nTALKING.

WHO IS THEY?\nTHE 32% SHORT INTEREST THAT WOULD THINK THE STOCK WOULD BE\nTRADING OUTSIDE OF 150 RIGHT NOW AND IT'S NOT.\nSO I THINK AGAINST 180, STAY LONG THE STOCK.\nI STILL DON'T KNOW WHO THE INCREMENTAL SELLER OF THE SHARES\nIS TO GET IT DOWN THERE. AND I THINK IT COULD SURPRISE\nEARNINGS ON THE 26th. >> THAT'S ONE OF THE CATALYSTS\nTHAT WOULD CONCERN ME. ONE OF THE BIG INSTITUTIONS\nTHROWS HER HANDS UP AND SAYS I'M OUT.\nAND THEY MAY NOT BE PUBLIC ABOUT IT. >> OFTEN WHEN YOU HAVE A\nFIDELITY OR CAPITAL -- >> CUT SERVICE AT THIS POINT\nAFTER THE SOLARCITY DEAL WAS ANNOUNCED SO LONG AGO AND THE\nVOTE IS COMING UP ON THE 28th? >> AT SOME POINT, PEOPLE ARE\nGOING TO GET KIND OF FRUSTRATED WITH THE LACK OF DELIVERY AND\nCASH BURN AND THE WHOLE MODEL GETTING PUSHED OUT INTO THE\nFUTURE. AND COMPETITION IS HEATING UP TO\nA PLACE WHERE -- I DON'T CARE WHAT THESE GUYS DO AT SOME\nPOINT. THEY CAN NEVER BE WORTH THIS\nMULTIPLE, EVEN IF THEY'RE -- >> BUY THEMSELVES TIME BY\nHITTING THE LAST DELIVERY NUMBERS?\n>> CLEARLY, IT'S THE STOCK SHOWING THAT, BUT WELL BELOW\nWHERE IT CAME FROM. I DON'T THINK SO.\n>> JUST REAL QUICKLY. I'M SURPRISED THEY WOULDN'T\nCOULD DO IT IN STRENGTH. MAYBE THEY CAN DO A BETTER JOB\nSELLING EQUITY OR SOMETHING LATER.\n>> STILL AHEAD, SAMSUNG'S PHONE NIGHTMARE CONTINUES AS THE\nCOMPANY HALTS PRODUCTION OF THE GALAXY NOTE 7.\nWILL IT HAVE CUSTOMERS FLEEING FOR GOOD?\nWE'VE GOT A SPECIAL \"FAST MONEY\"",
