              "text": "I STILL THINK IT'S DONALD TRUMP.\n>> ALL RIGHT. SO WHEN YOU SAY THAT, YOU DON'T\nTHINK THAT THESE OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE RAISED -- YOU ARE\nRIGHT, THEY ARE 11 YEARS OLD, COMMENTS THAT SUDDENLY CAME TO\nLIGHT -- ARE NOW DISTRACTION FROM THAT MESSAGE AND THAT IT'S\nHURTING HIS MESSAGE? >> OH, NO.\nIT'S DISTRACTION. AND IT IS MOST DEFINITELY\nHURTING HIM. BUT AS A REPUBLICAN AND A CONSERVATIVE, WHERE ELSE DO I\nHAVE TO GO? I MEAN, IF I DON'T HAVE MR.\nTRUMP, AM I GOING TO GO TO MRS. CLINTON, WHAT WENT AFTER THE\nVICTIMS OF BILL'S SEXUAL  PUBLICLY AND WASN'T SUPPORTIVE\nOF THEM? ONE WHO WANTS OPEN BORDERS, WHO\nWANTS MORE TAXES, MORE REGULATION, ALLOWED FOR THE\nGROWTH OF ISIS? I HAVE NO HOME IN HILLARY\nCLINTON. SO I'M STUCK WITH THE ONLY GUY\nTHAT BEST MATCHES MY ECONOMIC POSITIONS AND MY GLOBAL IDEAS WHICH IS DONALD TRUMP.\nI MEAN WE ARE IN A TOUGH PLACE NO, DOUBT ABOUT IT.\n>> BUT THERE IS ANOTHER PLAN AFOOT, I'M SURE YOU ARE AWARE\nTHERE IS ANOTHER PLAN AFOOT TO MAYBE BRING ANOTHER NOMINEE\nFORWARD. MAYBE THAT COULD BE GOVERNOR\nPENCE. I HAVE NO IDEA.\nBUT THEY ARE LOOKING THAT BUT COMING UP KIND OF WITHOUT ANY\nCLEAR LEGAL GROUNDS TO DO IT. >> I MEAN, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY\nAND CONSERVATIVES LIKE ME WILL CROSS THAT BRIDGE IF ONE IS EVER\nPUT THIS FRONT OF US. YOU MENTIONED THAT MR. TRUMP\nTWEETED HE IS NOT GOING TO GET OUT OF THE RACE.\nI DON'T THINK HE WILL. >> HE IS NOT.\nCONGRESSMAN. >> WE ARE IN SIMULTANEOUS USE\nWATERS. >> WE'LL WATCH THIS CLOSE.\nHERE'S A GUY WHO MIGHT HAVE SOME IDEAS.\nPAUL RYAN. EARLIER TODAY HE IS DISINVITED\nTRUMP TO THIS VERY EVENT. LISTEN TO WHAT HE HAS TO SAY.\n>> I MANY WHAT I SAID AND IT'S STILL HOW I FEEL.\nBUT THAT IS NOT WHAT WE ARE HERE TO TALK ABOUT TODAY.\nYOU KNOW WHAT WE DO HERE IN FALL FEST?\nWE TALK ABOUT YOUR IDEAS. WE TALK ABOUT OUR SOLUTIONS.\nWE TALK ABOUT OUR CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES AND WE PROMOTE OUR\nCANDIDATES RIGHT HERE IN WISCONSIN THAT ARE FIGHTING FOR\nUS, CANDIDATES LIKE OUR SENATOR, RON JOHNSON.\nYOU KNOW, WHAT MATTERS IN ELECTIONS IS ARE WE GIVING\nPEOPLE REAL CHOICES? SEVEN PEOPLE OUT OF TEN PEOPLE\nIN AMERICA, SEVEN OUT OF TEN PEOPLE IN AMERICA, THEY DON'T\nTHINK THIS COUNTRY IS ON THE RIGHT TRACK, DO THEY?\nSEVEN OUT TEN PEOPLE, THEY THINK THEIR KIDS ARE GOING TO BE WORSE\nOFF IN THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE\nIN THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE NEVER GIVEN THE NEXT\nGENERATION A DARKER FUTURE. WE HAVE ALWAYS STEPPED UP AND\nFIXED THE PROBLEMS IN FRONT OF US IN OUR GENERATION SO THAT OUR\nCHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN CAN BE BETTER OFF.\nAND YOU KNOW WHAT -- YOU KNOW WE'RE DOING ABOUT IT IN THE\nHOUSE, YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING ABOUT IT AS CONSERVATIVES, WE\nARE OFFERING PEOPLE A BETTER WAY.\nWE ARE OFFERING SOLUTIONS. I TELL YOU WHAT, LAST JANUARY WE\nGOT TOGETHER OF WE SAID WE NEED TO TAKE AN AGENDA TO THE\nCOUNTRY. WE NEED TO SHOW MEN AND WOMEN IN\nAMERICA THOSE SEVEN OUT OF TEN PEOPLE, THAT'S NOT JUST\nREPUBLICANS. THAT'S NOT JUST INDEPENDENTS.\nTHAT'S DEMOCRATS ALSO. THEY NEED TO HAVE SOLUTIONS.\nAND WE ARE OFFERING THEM. LET ME TELL YOU A FEW THING.\nNUMBER ONE, SIX PLANS -- GO TO BETTER.GOP.\nSIX THINGS. WE HAVE GOT TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF\nWELFARE AND BACK INTO THE WORK FORCE.\nOUR WELFARE SYSTEM ISN'T WORKING.\nOUR WELFARE SYSTEM TELLS PEOPLE STAY OUT OF WORK.\nWE NEED TO GET PEOPLE BACK INTO WORK SO THEY CAN GET ON THE\nLADDER OF LIFE SO THEY CAN REACH THEIR DREAMS.\nWE'RE SHOWING YOU EXACTLY WHAT WELFARE REFORM LOOKS LIKE.\nYOU KNOW, SECOND THING. WE ARE NOT SAFE.\nYOU KNOW THIS. YOU SEE THIS TERRORIST ATTACKS\nIN THIS COUNTRY. SEE WHAT'S GOING ON OVERSEAS.\nWE HAVE A PRESIDENT, PRESIDENT OBAMA THAT IS PHONING IT IN ON\nNATIONAL SECURITY. WE HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT HAS\nBEEN HOLLOWING OUT OUR MILITARY. WE ARE SHOWING YOU EXACTLY WHAT\nIT TAKES TO REBUILD OUR MILITARY, TO SECURE OUR BORDER,\nTO GO ON OFFENSE AGAINST ISIS, AND TO KEEP AMERICA SAFE.\nTHIS IS IMPORTANT. I TELL YOU WHAT -- AND YOU WANT\nTO GET JOBS IN THIS ECONOMY, GET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OUT OF\nTHE BUSINESS OF MICRO MANAGING EVERY LITTLE ASPECT OF OUR\nLIVES, OF OUR COMMUNITIES, OF OUR SOCIETY, OF OUR SMALL\nBUSINESSES. WE ARE LOSING SELF GOVERNMENT\nTHIS COUNTRY. WE'VE GOT THIS NEW FOURTH BRANCH\nOF GOVERNMENT, UNELECTED BUREAUCRATS ARE WRITING OUR\nLAWS. LOOK AT THIS.\nWE HAD A CASE MADE RIGHT OVER THERE IN RACINE.\nAND YOU HAVE GOT THIS WATERS OF U.S.A. REGULATION COMING FROM\nTHE EPA. IT IS TELLING FARM URS HOW WHEN\nWHERE AND WHAT THEY HAVE GOT TO DO IF THEY WANT TO FARM.\nAND THESE THINGS DON'T GO THROUGH CONGRESS.\nHERE'S WHAT WE ARE SAYING. ALL OF THESE RULES AND ALL OF\nTHESE REGULATIONS THAT COME FROM THESE UNELECTED BUREAUCRACIES\nTHAT DON'T KNOW OUR COMMUNITY, THAT KNOW OUR PEOPLE THAT DON'T\nKNOW OUR BUSINESSES -- ALL OF THAT HAS GOT TO GO THROUGH\nCONGRESS, CONGRESS, FOR A FINAL VOTE, APPROVAL AMENDMENT BEFORE\nIT GOES INTO EFFECT. IT'S A SIMPLE PRINCIPLE.\nTHE PRINCIPLE IS ONE OF OUR FOUNDING PRINCIPLES.\nWE GOVERN OURSELVES AS AMERICANS.\nWE BELIEVE IN SELF GOVERNMENT. THE LAWS THAT WE LIVE UNDER IN\nTHIS COUNTRY NEED TO BE WRITTEN BY US THROUGH YOUR ELECTED\nREPRESENTATIVES. NOT BY THESE UNELECTED\nBUREAUCRACIES. AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE\nOFFERING. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE\nRUNNING ON. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE\nGIVING PEOPLE. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT.\nHOW MANY OF YOU THINK OBAMA CARE IS WORKING?\nI DON'T THINK HE THINKS BOOM CARE -- OBAMA CARE IS WORKING.\nIT'S FAILING. BIGGEST HEALTH INSURANCE\nCOMPANIES IN THE COUNTRY, UNITED PULLED OUT, AETNA PULLED OUT.\nTHIS THING IS IN A DEATH SPIRAL. PREMIUMS ARE DOUBLING EVERY\nYEAR. THE DEDUCTIBLES ARE SO HIGH YOU\nMIGHT AS WELL NOT EVEN HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE.\nWE ARE SHOWING YOU SIRS TIME IN SEVEN YEARS, REPUBLICANS HAVE\nALTERNATIVES. IT IS REPUBLICANS HAVE\nALTERNATIVES. REPLACE OBAMA CARE WITH PATIENT\nCENTERED HEALTH CARE SO WE CAN CHOOSE WHAT WE WANT FOR OUR\nFAMILIES, LOWER PRICE, MORE COMPETITION, LOWER PRICES.\nAND I HAVE GOT TO TELL YOU YOU ARE NOT GOING TO FIX THIS\nECONOMY. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GROW JOBS,\nYOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET ECONOMIC GROWTH AND JOB\nCREATION -- ALL RIGHT. WE ARE MONITORING SPEAKER PAUL\nRYAN AT THIS BIG WISCONSIN EVENT.\nIT WAS TO FEATURE DONALD TRUMP TODAY.\nIN FACT THEY WERE EVEN CONSIDERING HAVING GOVERNOR\nPENCE WITH HIM AS SORT OF A UNITED EFFORT BETWEEN THE\nESTABLISHMENT AND THIS RENEGADE TICKET, FULL.\nBUT THEN THOSE COMMENTS CAME TO LIGHT OF WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAID\n11 YEARS AGO AND THEN ALL BETS WERE OFF.\nTHE SPEAKER DISINVITED MR. TRUMP BUT KEPT THE EVENT GOING ON.\nHOW, YOU CAN HEAR QUITE A FEW TRUMP LOYALISTS IN THE AUDIENCE\nNOT VERY PLEASED WITH MR. RYAN AND NOT VERY PLEASED THEY HAVE\nOSTRACIZE THEIR CANDIDATE. BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS.\nA GROWING MOVEMENT. BETTER THAN A DOZEN KEY PLAYERS\nIN THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE. AND THOSE WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY\nBACKED MR. TRUMP WHO NOW SAY HE SHOULD STEP ASIDE.\nAGAIN I STRESS THAT ISN DONE AN CLEAR HISTORICAL PRECEDENT FOR\nIN A SHORT OF THE DEATH OF THE NOMINEE.\nOF COURSE YOU HAVE HEARD FROM MR. TRUMP THAT HE HAS NO\nINTENTION OF STEPPING DOWN. SO THE FALLOUT FROM ALL OF THIS\nWITH DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST EMILY SUTTON, AND CATTY LISTEN DES\nFROM THE GOP. NOELE BICKFORD.\nNOELE, THIS DOES NOTHING TO HELP DONALD TRUMP'S MOMENTUM.\nFROM YOUR VANTAGE POINT, WHAT IS IT DOING TO HIS POTENTIAL\nFUND-RAISING IT'S GOING TO HURT HIM IN FUND-RAISING, NEIL.\nTHE REASON WHY IS BECAUSE ANY DONOR THAT WAS ALREADY ON THE\nFENCE -- I ACTUALLY SPOKE TO SOMEONE ON THE WEST COAST THIS\nMORNING AND I SAID WELL GIVE IT TO ME STRAIGHT.\nI GOES KIDDO, I WAS GOING TO WRITE A CHECK TO HIM TODAY.\nHE GOES RIGHT NOW, I DON'T WANT MY NAME ASSOCIATED WITH HIM.\nI ASKED HIM THIS. I SAID ALREADY SO YOU ARE NOT\nGOING TO SUPPORT HIM BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT YOUR NAME ON THE\nREPORT. HE SAID THAT'S TRUE.\nI GO, ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE FOR HIM?\nHE GOES ABSOLUTELY. YOU CAN SEE WHERE THERE IS GOING\nTO BE A DISCONNECT BUT THEY ARE GOING TO STAY THE COURSE AND\nVOTE. WHAT OTHER CHOICE DO THEY HAVE?\nTHEY DON'T. >> THE HOPE IS AMONG SOME OF\nTHOSE MAINSTREAMERS IF THEY CAN COME UP WITH A CHOICE.\nTHAT MIGHT BE EASIER SAID THAN DONE, RIGHT.\n>> THE REAL ISSUE HERE, WOMEN ARE THE LARGEST VOTING BLOC,\n52%. AND YOUR EARLIER WOMEN VOTERS\nTHAT YOU HAD ON SAID IT WELL. FOR TOO LONG, THE DEMOCRATIC\nPARTY HAS HIJACKED THE MESSAGE TO WOMEN.\nTHEY ARE GOING TO USE THIS AS ANOTHER CHAMPL.\nBUT PROBLEM IS THAT OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS THANKS TO OBAMA\nAND HILLARY CLINTON AND PREDATING BACK TO BILL CLINTON\nWE HAVE 2 MILLION MORE WOMEN LIVING IN POVERTY, 50% OF\nAMERICA'S SCHOOL CHILDREN -- >> CATHY, I DON'T WANT TO\nINTERRUPT YOU BUT WE ARE LOOKING AT MIG PENCE.\nHE IS LEAVING INDIANAPOLIS NOW FOR A FUND-RAISING EVENT IN\nPROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND, I BELIEVE.\nHE ALSO WAS CRITICAL OF DONALD TRUMP AND THESE COMMENTS BUT HE\nWANTED TO KEEP THE MESSAGE ON -- THE MESSAGE OF THAT CAMPAIGN.\nAND NOT GIVEN ANY FREE PASSES TO HILLARY CLINTON.\nBUT HE IS UNDER ENORMOUS PRESSURE NOW AS PARTY SURROGATES\nARE TOYING WITH THE IDEA OF HAVING HIM MOVE FORWARD AND STEP\nUP AS THE PARTY'S NOMINEE. THERE ARE NO RULES IN PLACE THAT\nWOULD ALLOW THAT THOUGH WHAT DO YOU THINK?\n>> THERE IS NO PRECEDENT FOR THIS.\nTHERE HAS BEEN NO PRECEDENT THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE CAMPAIGN\nIF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, THE NUMBER OF UNUSUAL THING THAT\nHAVE HAPPENED. BUT I STILL THINK THAT AS A\nREPUBLICAN PARTY WE CAN FIND COMMON GROUND IN UNCOMMON TIMES.\nMIKE PENCE HAS DONE AN UNFLAPPABLE JOB OVER THE COURSE\nOF HIS VICE PRESIDENTIAL ACCOUNTSY SUPPORTING DONALD\nTRUMP. I HAVE NO DOUBT HE WILL FIND THE\nRIGHT PATH GOING FORWARD. THE MAIN ISSUE IS WOMEN HAVE TO\nSTOP LIVING CONSERVATIVE AND VOTING LIKE DEMOCRATS NO MATTER\nWHAT THE FALLOUT OF THIS IS CONSERVATIVE POLICIES HAVE\nBETTER EMPOWERED AND PROTECTED WOMEN.\nTHAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER. >> EMILY, DO YOU GET A SENSE\nDEMOCRATS ARE GETTING INCREASINGLY REPUBLICANS MIGHT\nJUST FIND ANOTHER NOMINEE BECAUSE THIS ONE LOOKS BEATEN UP\nENOUGH WHERE A LOT OF YOU FOLKS THINK YOU CAN EASILY BEAT HIM IN\nTHE ELECTION A HOP FROM TODAY. A NEW GUY?\nMAYBE NOT SO MUCH. >> TRUMP IS STAYING IN THE RACE.\nONE THING WE KNOW ABOUT DONALD TRUMP IS HIS EGO.\n>> YOU WANT HIM TO STAY IN THE RACE.\n>> THE REPUBLICAN PARTY CHOSE THEIR NOMINEE.\nIT IS NOT DEMOCRAT CREATED. HE IS THEIR NOMINEE.\nDOWN THE TICKET, EVERY SENATOR, EVERY MEMBER OF CONGRESS WHO HAS\nENDORSED SAID THEY WILL STILL VOTE FOR YOU, DO YOU STILL\nSUPPORT HIM AND DO YOU THINK HE WILL MAKE A GOOD PRESIDENT?\nI KNOW YOU HAD SHAWN DUFFY ON THERE IS NO CHOICE, HE HAS TO\nKEEP SUPPORTING HIM THAT'S NOT TRUE.\nIF YOU DON'T THINK HE WILL GOVERN WELL AND YOU DON'T THINK\nHIS JUDGMENT IS THERE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE DIFFICULT DECISIONS\nIN FRONT OF A PRESIDENT EVERY DAY THEN FIND A WAY TO WORK WITH\nHILLARY CLINTON AS PRESIDENT. THAT IS THE OPTION IN FRONT OF\nALL OF THEM RIGHT YOU NO. THEY CAN KEEP PUTTING UP WALLS,\nKEEP TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO SAY THIS IS TOO FAR BECAUSE IT IS A\nAFFECTING MY BASE. THEY ARE WORRIED THEY ARE GOING\nTO LOSE REPUBLICAN WOMEN, INDEPENDENT WOMEN, REPUBLICAN\nVOTERS ACROSS THE BOARD WHO FIND WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAID APAULING\nAS EVERYBODY SHOULD, AND THEY ARE TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO\nCONSOLIDATE THEIR BASE. THIS SHUNT BE ABOUT POLITICS,\nTHIS SHOULD BE ABOUT POLITICS AND GOVERNING.\n>> HILLARY CLINTON IS NO BETTER AN EXAMPLE OF GOVERNING.\n>> EVERYTHING COMES BACK TO POLITICS, LADIES.\nBUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL OF YOU, VERY MUCH.\nSO CAN BE DONE NOW IF THERE IS THIS MOVE TO TRY TO FIND AN\nALTERNATIVE NOMINEE TO DONALD TRUMP?\nTHE ONLY KIND OF RECENT HISTORY, AND IT'S NOT EVEN RECENT\nHISTORY, 1872, FREELY, THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE ENDS UP DYING\nAFTER THE ELECTION BUT BEFORE THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE MET.\nIT WAS A MOOT POINT. ULYSSES GRANT HAD ESSENTIALLY\nALREADY WON. THAT'S ABOUT THE MOST WE CAN SEE\nOF THIS SITUATION. ALSO IN 1972, WHEN THOMAS\nEAGLESON WAS GORGE McGOVERN'S RUNNING MATE EVEN THOUGH\nMcGOVERN SAID HE WAS BEHIND HIM A THOUSAND PERCENT WHEN WORD\nCAME THAT THE SENATOR UNDERGONE SHOCK TREATMENT OUT HE WENT AND\nIN CAME SERGEANT SHRIVER AND THAT NOVEMBER CAME A HUGE\nDEMOCRATIC LANDSLIDE DEFEAT. DOUG WEED, PRESIDENTIAL\nHISTORIAN, ED ROLLINS FORMER REAGAN ADVISOR, TRUMP SUPPORTER.\nDOUG, THERE IS NO PRECEDENT FOR A SITUATION LIKE THIS WHERE THE\nNOMINEE IS NEITHER ILL NOR DEAD. SO WHAT DO YOU DO?\n>> YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. YOU MENTIONED HORACE GREELEY, HE\nWAS A LIBERAL REPUBLICAN WHO BROKE AWAY FROM GRANT BECAUSE\nGRANT WAS CORRUPT. >> THAT'S RIGHT.\n>> AND DEMOCRATS SAY HEY WE COULDN'T DO ANY BETTER.\nTHAT'S WHY THEY SUPPORTED HIM. THIS ISN'T GOING TO HAPPEN.\nONE OF THE MAIN REASONS IT ISN'T GOING TO HAPPEN IS MIKE PENCE.\nMIKE PENCE IS IN A PERFECT POSITION.\nIF TRUMP WINS WHICH SEEMS UNLIKELY, HE IS VICE PRESIDENT.\nIF HE LOSES HE'S IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT NEXT TIME AREN'T.\nAND THE MORE LOYAL HE IS TO TRUMP, THE BETTER HE LOOKS.\nAND LET'S FACE IT, MOST OF THE REPUBLICANS, LIKE IT OR NOT,\nTHEY LIKE -- THEY LIKE TRUMP. SO PENCE DOESN'T WANT TO MAKE\nTHEM ANGRY AND ALL THESE OTHER REPUBLICANS PROMOTING THIS IDEA\nTHEY WANT TO BE PRESIDENT THEMSELVES.\nTHEY ARE NOT GOING TO SWORD MIKE PENCE.\n>> YEAH, YOU DON'T WANT TO MESS WITH THAT, RIGHT.\n>> WE SHOULD POINT OUT, TOO IN THE CASE OF HORACE GREELEY IN\n1872 -- AND OF COURSE DOUG CAN TELL YOU THAT, HE COVERED THAT\nAT THE TIME, KID, KIDDING, BUT THE ELECTION ALREADY HAPPENED.\n>> I WAS 5 YEARS OLD. >> SO THIS WAS BEFORE THE\nELECTORAL COLLEGE MET. WHICH IS A DIFFERENT BEAST AND A\nDIFFERENT COMPARISON THERE. ED ROLLINS, THIS ISSUE OF THE\nFINE LINE THAT GOVERNOR PENCE HAS TO WALK, ED ROLLINS, WHAT DO\nYOU THINK OF THAT? OBVIOUSLY, HE HAS TO BE --\nADDRESS THE COMMENTS. BUT HE DOESN'T WANT TO GO TOO,\nTOO FAR WHAT DOES HE DO. >> HE IS A MAN OF PRINCIPLE.\nTHE AMERICAN PUBLIC GOT TO SEE HIM.\nHE IS A SPIRITUAL MAN, RELIGIOUS MAN, A LEADER IN THE EVANGELICAL\nMAN. AND A FUTURE PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATE FOR OUR PARTY. I THINK HE HAS ALREADY EXPRESSED\nHESS OUTRAGE. I THINK HIS STATEMENT IS\nMEASURED STATEMENT. I'M A FATHER OF A 21-YEAR-OLD\nDAUGHTER, AND I HAVE A WONDERFUL WIFE, AND TWO WONDERFUL SISTERS.\nLIKE EVERYONE ELSE I'M APPALLED BY THE STATEMENTS THAT WERE\nMADE. DONALD TRUMP HAS TO TURN THIS\nTHING AROUND. HE HAS TO GET ON THE STAGE\nTOMORROW NIGHT, HAS TO EAT CROW. HAS TO DO A MAYA CULPA.\nHE HAS TO TAKE ABOUT I MADE A MAJOR MISTAKE.\nI AM AT A DIFFERENT PLACE IN MY LIFE.\nI LOVE MY WIFE, I CARE DEEPLY ABOUT MY DAUGHTERS.\nI APOLOGIZE TO VOTERS AND WOMEN EVERYWHERE AND HE HAS 30 DAYS TO\nTALK ABOUT HOW HE IS GOING TO LEAD THIS COUNTRY.\nHE CAN WAKE UP AS PRESIDENT ON NOVEMBER 9:H 9th OR WAKE UP AS\nTHE MOST DESPLIKIBLE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE IN AMERICAN HISTORY.\nTHAT'S HIS CHOICE. WHICH HE HASN'T DONE TO THIS\nPOINT. >> CAN HE DO THAT?\nHE HAS OVERCOME DIFFERENT ISSUES IN THE PAST.\nTHIS IS PARTICULARLY UNIQUE. TO SOME, ONEROUS.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK? >> HE HAS TIME.\nWHAT MAKES THIS MOMENT BAD IS THE FACT THAT WE JUST NOW\nLEARNED ABOUT IT. THAT'S THE ONLY REASON IT'S BAD.\nYOU CAN COMPARE THIS TO WHAT FDR DID TO MISSY LA HAND.\nOR LBJ TO FIDDLE AND FADLE. OR JOHN KENNEDY TO MIMI ALL\nFORWARD. FOR BLIL BILL CLINTON TO JUANITA\nBRODERICK. THERE IS NO COMPARISON.\nTHIS IS NOT A BIG DEAL EXCEPT IT IS A CURRENT.\nWE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT. AND THAT WAS THE DANGER YOU HAVE\nIN HAVING A CANDIDATE WHO HADN'T RUN FOR GOVERNOR SENATOR OR\nCONGRESSMAN. >> THESE ARE WORDS SPOKEN VERSUS\nBY THESE GENTLEMEN IN THESE EXAMPLES ACTIONS TAKEN.\nIT IS WHAT IT IS. WE'LL HAVE MORE RIGHT AFTER\nTHIS.",

WE WOULDN'T BE DOING THIS IF WE\nDIDN'T ACTUALLY THINK WE HAD THE CHANCE TO WIN.\nAND RIGHT NOW I THINK THE REPUBLICAN TICKET IS IMPLODING.\nTHERE IS AN HONORABLE ALTERNATIVE TO THAT.\nI THINK HILLARY -- YOU KNOW, IF THESE E-MAILS, IF HER\nSTATEMENTS, HER SPEECHES IN FRONT OF WALL STREET ACTUALLY\nGARNER ENOUGH ATTENTION? WELL YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT'S\nSOMEBODY WHO SAYS ONE THING ONE PLACE AND DOES ANOTHER THING\nSOMEWHERE ELSE.

PEOPLE SAY THIS IS THE WAY THEY\nTALK. >> I PLAYED FOOTBALL IN COLLEGE,\nYOU KNOW, THERE IS SOMETHING TO THAT BUT THAT DOES NOT TAKE AWAY\nFROM THE FACT THAT THE COMMENTS SHOULD NOT JUST BE EXCUSED AND\nGO AWAY. I ECHO WHAT HE SAID WHEN HE SAID\nI'M GOING TO BE A BETTER MAN TOMORROW AND ALL OF US IN THIS\nCOUNTRY SHOULD WANT TO BE BETTER PEOPLE THE NEXT DAY AND\nCONCENTRATE ON THAT AND HAVE A BETTER DAY FOR OUR COUNTRY THE\nNEXT DAY BUT ALL HILLARY CLINTON CARES ABOUT IS BECOMING\nPRESIDENT AND MAYBE GETTING MORE MONEY FOR HER PAY TO PLAY\nSCANDAL. THAT'S WHAT SHE HAS BEEN DOING.\nTHEY RENTED OUT THE LINCOLN BEDROOM AND THE STATE\nDEPARTMENT. SHE WANTS TO DO THE SAME TO THE\nWHOLE WHITE HOUSE. DONALD TRUMP WILL NOT ALLOW THAT\nTO HAPPEN. >> THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE WITH\nUS. >> THANK YOU.\n>> JOINING ME NOW IS SOMEONE WITH A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TAKE\nON THE NEWS IN THE LAST 24 HOUR. LIBERAL RADIO TALK SHOW HOST.\nALL RIGHT. LANGUAGE THAT WE DON'T APPROVE\nOF AND CERTAINLY LANGUAGE THAT IS GOING TO HURT DONALD TRUMP\nWITH WOMEN LIKE YOURSELF AND OTHER PEOPLE BUT DON'T YOU THINK\nTHAT THIS IS THE KIND OF LANGUAGE THAT YOU KNOW, NO\nMATTER WHAT HE SAYS, YOU'LL NEVER FORGIVE HIM FOR BECAUSE\nIT'S ALL ABOUT POLITICS? >> NO, I THINK HE'S AN AN\nABOMINATION BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU TALKED ABOUT WHEN WHICH\nIS ACTIONS MATTER MORE THAN WORDS.\nSO LET'S PUT HIS WORDS ASIDE. THIS IS A MAN THAT'S BEEN SUED\nFOR RAPE OF HIS WIFE. A BUSINESS ASSOCIATE AND A\n13-YEAR-OLD KID -- >> I'M GOING TO STOP YOU RIGHT\nTHERE. >> THREE TIMES.\n>> STOP, STOP -- >> THAT'S ACTIONS NOT WORDS.\n>> LOOK, LOOK, THERE'S ONLY ONE THING I WANT TO ASK YOU AND THAT\nIS IF I'M ASKING YOU A QUESTION AND YOU SAY SOMETHING THAT'S NOT\nFACTUAL AND I SAY STOP THEN WE HAVE TO START ALL OVER.\nSHE WITHDREW THAT. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE FACT THAT\nBILL CLINTON IS SOMEONE THAT ACTUALLY HAD TO PAY $850,000 FOR\nTAKING SOMETHING OUT OF HIS PANTS AND SHOWING IT TO PAULA\nJONES AND THEN HE AN INTERN, HIS SEMEN WAS ON AN INTERN'S DRESS?\nYOU GOING TO GO THERE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LANGUAGE\nVERSUS ACTIONS. >> I WILL SAY THAT BILL CLINTON\nWAS GOOD FOR HALLOWEEN COSTUMES EVERYWHERE.\n>> IT'S THAT SIMPLE. >> I'M NOT VOTING FOR HIM.\nI'M VOTING FOR HILLARY -- IS MILANIA RESPONSIBLE FOR DONALD\nTRUMP'S WORDS AND ACTIONS? IS SHE RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERY BAD\nTHING THIS GUY DOES? >> NO, SHE'S NOT AND THE REASON\nHILLARY IS HILLARY CREATED A CAREER IN A WAR ROOM TO TAKE ON\nTHE WOMEN THAT CRITICIZED HER HUSBAND AND A WOMAN WHO CLAIMED\nTHAT BE BILL CLINTON RAPED HER WAS THREATENED BY HILLARY.\nWE'RE TALKING ABOUT A LOCKER ROOM CONVERSATION BETWEEN TWO\nGUYS ON TELEVISION. >> THIS ISN'T A LOCKER ROOM\nCONVERSATION. HE BOASTED ABOUT SEXUALLY\nASSAULTING WOMEN. LET'S PUT THAT ASIDE.\nTHE THING THAT IS -- ITS NOT HIS WORDS.\nIT'S THE FACT THAT THIS GUY IS NOT A PATRIOT.\nHE HAS NO RESPECT FOR THE UNITED STATES OR IT'S LAWS.\nHE DOESN'T PAY TAXES. HE DOESN'T OBEY THE LAW --\n>> LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION. CANDIDATE WAS INVESTIGATED BY\nTHE FBI FOR A YEAR WITH OVER 10 AGENTS ON HER CASE AND A CLINTON\nFOUNDATION, 501C3 THEY WON'T LOOK AT.\nTHEY LIED TO CONGRESS. SHE LIED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\nOVER AND OVER AGAIN. >> TRUMP'S FOUNDATION DOES.\n>> DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE LOOKING AT THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION. LET'S NOT GO THERE.\nLET'S START HERE. HOW IS IT THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON -- HOW IS IT THAT HILLARY CLINTON AND HER HUSBAND\nARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 25% OF OUR URANIUM BEING TOLD TO PUTIN WHO\nNOW OWNS 25% OF THE URANIUM IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE OF HIS\nDEALS THROUGH THE FOUNDATION? DO YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT THAT TOO?\n>> I MEAN, I FEEL A LOT BETTER ABOUT ANYTHING THAT YOU'RE GOING\nTO SAY THAN A GUY HIKE TRUMP WHO IS BEHOLDEN TO PUTIN AND --\n>> OH CUT IT OUT. >> HE NEEDS THEIR MONEY.\n>> HILLARY SOLD OUR URANIUM TO RUSSIA.\nSTOP IT! >> THAT'S JUST CRAZY THAT THAT'S\nTHE TYPE OF TALK YOU GUY VERSUS BEEN PUSHING ON THE CLINTONS FOR\nYEARS. THE CLINTONS MUST BE THE\nGREATEST CRIMINALS IN HISTORY BECAUSE YOU GUYS HAVE SPENT\nBILLIONS OF DOLLARS INVESTIGATING THEM AND YOU HAVE\nNEVER BEEN ABLE TO FIND A FACT THAT IS INCRIMINATING.\nTHESE ARE GREAT PUBLIC SERVANTS. YOU JUST MADE THEM LOOK LIKE\nHORRIBLE PEOPLE ALL OF THESE YEARS.\n>> HOW DO YOU BECOME A $200 MILLION PERSON WHEN YOU HAVE NO\nCOMPANY, NOTHING TO SELL, NOT EVEN A WEBSITE.\nIT'S ALL PAY TO PLAY. >> I'LL TELL YOU HOW TRUMP DID\nIT -- >> TRUMP DID IT WITH CEMENT AND\nWITH BRICKS AND MONEY. >> HE INHERITED HIS MONEY.\n>> NO. YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO VOTE FOR\nDONALD. >> YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO VOTE\nFOR HILLARY BUT SHE'S GOING TO BE YOUR PRESIDENT AND YOU'RE\nGOING TO LIKE HER. >> WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH\nPASTOR ROBERT JEFFERS AND WE'LL SEE WHAT HE HAS TO SAY.",

HILLARY CLINTON WILL ALSO HAVE\nTO ANSWER TO THESE WIKILEAKS STORIES ABOUT HER PUBLIC VERSUS\nPRIVATE PERSONA AND THEY BETTER PRESS HER ON THA AS WELL.\nTHEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE SEEN AS COMING AT THESE\nCANDIDATES FAIRLY. I QUESTION WHY THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN DID NOT PUT DONALD TRUMP OUT THERE LAST NIGHT, WHY\nHE DIDN'T DO A SIT-DOWN INTERVIEW WITH A SORT OF NEUTRAL\nPARTY TO TALK ABOUT HIS LIFE, TO TALK ABOUT THE WAY HE SEES\nTHINGS, TO EXPRESS, YOU KNOW, HIS APOLOGY TO WOMEN THAT HE\nOFFENDED WITH THIS. HE COULD HAVE GOTTEN THIS SORRY\nA LITTLE BIT BEHIND HIM IN A WELL CRAFTED APPEARANCE LAST\nNIGHT AND I REALLY THINK THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE ONE OF THE\nQUESTIONS THAT CONTINUES TO DOG HIM.\nWHY DIDN'T THEY DO THAT LAST NIGHT?\n>> INSTEAD IT ALL COMES DOWN TO TONIGHT AND I PREDICT THAT THE\nVIEWERSHIP WILL BE AT LEAST AS HIGH IF NOT HIRE THAN THE FIRST\nDEBATE. LET'S TAKE A BRIEF LOOK BACK AT\nTHE VP DEBATE. CBS'S ELAINE QUIJANO A LITTLE\nLESS EXPERIENCED WITH THIS AS A MODERATOR.\n>> YOU CAN'T -- >> GENTLEMEN, THE PEOPLE AT HOME\nCANNOT UNDERSTAND EITHER ONE OF YOU WHEN YOU SPEAK OVER EACH\nOTHER. I WOULD PLEASE ASK YOU TO WAIT\nUNTIL IT IS -- THAT THE OTHER IS FINISHED.\n>> I WAS IN WASHINGTON, D.C. ON 9/11.\nI SAW THE CLOUDS OF SMOKE RISE FROM THE PENTAGON.\n>> I WAS IN VIRGINIA. WHERE THE PENT GONE --\n>> I KNOW YOU WERE. WE ALL LIVED THROUGH THAT DAY AS\nA NATION. >> YES, PLEASE.\n>> THE FBI DID AN INVESTIGATION. >> YES.\n>> AND THEY CONCLUDED. >> SENATOR.\n>> THAT THERE WAS NO REASONABLE PROSECUTOR --\n>> SENATOR KAINE, GOVERNOR PENCE, PLEASE.\n>> THERE WAS SO MUCH CROSS TALK IT WAS HARD TO HEAR.\nGOT ABOUT A MINUTE. DID ELAINE QUIJANO LOSE CONTROL\nOF THAT DEBATE AND IS THERE ANY DANGER OF THAT HAPPENING TONIGHT\nIN ST. LOUIS? >> YEAH, I THINK SHE DID A\nLITTLE BIT. I THINK BOTH OF THOSE GUYS CAME\nIN READY TO JUMP IN ON EACH OTHER.\nTIM KAINE SAID EVEN HIS WIFE SAID HE INTERRUPTED TOO MANY\nTIMES, I THINK IT WAS 72 TIMES, I DON'T THINK IT REFLECTED WELL\nON HIM. I DO NOT EXPECT THAT TO HAPPEN\nTONIGHT, I DON'T THINK ANDERSON COOPER OR MARTHA RADDATZ WHO I\nRAN INTO AND ASKED HER HOW SHE FELT ABOUT, SHE SAID SURE I'M\nNERVOUS. I DON'T THINK EITHER ONE OF THEM\nWOULD PUT UP WITH THE KIND OF THING WE SAW AT THE VP DEBATE.\n>> I'M WITH YOU ON THAT. OF COURSE EVERYBODY A LITTLE\nNERVOUS BEFORE SUCH A BIG EVENT. MARTHA MacCALLUM, GREAT TO SEE.\n>> YOU WE GET CONFUSED ALL THE TIME.\nTHANKS, HOWIE. SEE YOU LATER ON OUR SHOW.\nLOOKING FORWARD TO IT.",

FRANK, THIS DONALD TRUMP TAPE IS\nVERY VULGAR AND VERY DAMAGING AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY\nDEBATE ABOUT THAT, BUT DOES THE TSUNAMI OF MEDIA STORIES, THE\nENDLESS REPLAYING AND REPOSTING OF THE TAPE, DOES THAT AMPLIFY\nTHE IMPACT ON DONALD TRUMP? >> IT DOES, BUT THIS IS WHAT\nEVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT, THAT IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT TWITTER,\nIF YOU LOOK AT FACEBOOK, GOOGLE, INSTAGRAM, EVERYONE IS TALKING\nABOUT THIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.\nTHIS IS THE MOST TALKED ABOUT CAMPAIGN THAT I HAVE BEEN AROUND\nSINCE 1992, AND WHAT MAKES THIS ONE SIGNIFICANT IS THAT EVEN\nPEOPLE WHO DON'T CARE ABOUT POLITICS, WHO WOULD NORMALLY\nTURN THIS STUFF OFF WITH JUST ONE MONTH TO GO, THEY'RE ALL\nPAYING ATTENTION. THERE'S A REASON WHY THAT FIRST\nPRESIDENTIAL DEBATE WAS RECORD-SETTING.\nTHERE'S A REASON WHY THIS MORNING, SUNDAY MORNING, YOU CAN\nWAKE UP AT 7:00 A.M. AND IT IS FILLED WITH THIS CONVERSATION.\nIT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO\nSAY NEXT. >> SO IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE,\nTHEREFORE, TO LOOK AT THIS PURELY IN TERMS OF POLITICAL ANALYSIS?\nI HAD MY QUESTIONS HERE TO ASK YOU, DOES IT AFFECT WITH HIM\nWITH WOMEN, WITH ALL VOTERS? YOU'RE SAYING THISES A CULTURAL\nEVENT. IT IS EVERYWHERE ONLINE AND,\nTHEREFORE, THE INTEREST, YOU KNOW, EVEN -- IS JUST HUGE\nWHETHER YOU ORDINARILY TUNE IN TO POLITICS HEAVILY OR NOT.\n>> YOU CAN'T GET AWAY FROM IT, AND PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO GET\nAWAY FROM IT. IT'S WHY FOX NEWS IS HAVING IT'S\nALL-TIME RECORD RATINGS AND THE COMPETITION IS ALSO UP.\nYOU'RE PICKING IT UP ON TALK RADIO AND NEWSPAPERS AND THE\nPROBLEM IS THEY'RE NOT ASKING ABOUT SUBSTANCE, AND, HOWARD, I\nREALLY DO THINK THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT NO ONE IS ASKING WHICH ONE\nIS BETTER ABLE TO HANDLE NUCLEAR -- A NUCLEAR WAR.\nWHICH ONE IS BETTER ABLE TO BALANCE THE BUDGET.\nIT'S ALL ABOUT THE PERSONA. IT'S ABOUT THEIR CHARACTER\nTRAITS, AND THAT'S GOOD UP TO A POINT, BUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\nNEED TO BE TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUES, AND NOBODY IS RIGHT NOW.\nTHE CANDIDATES AREN'T. THE MEDIA ISN'T.\nTHE PUNDITS AREN'T. NOBODY IS.\n>> DO YOU THINK THE REASON THAT THE MEDIA ARE SHYING AWAY -- I\nMEAN, OVER THE COURSE OF A CAMPAIGN OBVIOUSLY WE'VE TALKED\nA BIT ABOUT THE ECONOMY AND TAXES AND TERRORISM, BUT THE\nMEDIA SHYING AWAY BECAUSE THIS OTHER STUFF, THE JUICY STUFF,\nTHE TALK OF SEX TAPES, TALKS OF MISS UNIVERSE, ALL OF THAT IS\nLIKE CAPNIP AND IS MUCH MORE FUN TO COVER AND DELIVERS THE BETTER\nRATINGS? IF SO, WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT\nTHE NEWS BUSINESS? >> WE'VE BEEN FINDING THIS OUT\nFOR THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS. IT'S GENUINELY UPSETTING FOR\nTHOSE OF US WHO CARE ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY.\nTHIS IS AN IMPOSSIBLE CAMPAIGN FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME TO COVER\nBECAUSE NOBODY -- NOT ONLY ARE THEY NOT TALKING ABOUT THE\nISSUES, THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE ISSUES ARE, SOCIAL\nSECURITY, EDUCATION, THINGS AFFECTING US RIGHT NOW OR OVER\nTHE NEXT GENERATION, AND INSTEAD WE'RE DISCUSSING THE \"P\" WORD,\nAND BY THE WAY, WATCHING \"SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE,\" AND THIS\nIS SOMETHING THAT I ALSO FIND SIGNIFICANT, FOR FIRST TIME EVER\nJUST ABOUT EVERY ONE OF GEORGE CARLIN'S WORDS THAT YOU CAN'T\nSAY ON TELEVISION YOU CAN NOW SAY, THANK YOU, DONALD TRUMP,\nTHANK YOU, MEDIA. THAT'S WHERE WE'VE COME, AND\nIT'S A DISGRACE. >> I'VE GOT ABOUT HALF A MINUTE.\nSO RATHER THAN JUST PILE ON THE JOURNALISTS AND THE PUNDITS AND\nTHE NEWS ORGANIZATIONS CHASING THE COTTON CANDY AND IGNORING\nTHE SUBSTANCE, WHAT I'M HEARING FROM YOU IS THIS IS A REFLECTION\nOF THE COUNTRY, THAT WE ARE A MIRROR TO A COUNTRY THAT IS\nINCREASINGLY AMUSING ITSELF TO DEATH?\n>> THERE IS A BATTLE BETWEEN WILLIAM F. BUCKLEY AND THAT\nTRIPE AND THE PBS CROWD AND THE JERRY SPRINGER AND THAT CROWD,\nAND, UNFORTUNATELY, HOWARD, THE JERRY SPRINGER CROWD WON, AND\nWE'RE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO GO BACK.\nTHE THING I TELL EVERY VIEWER, ONCE YOU STEP OVER THAT LINE OF\nCIVILITY AND INDECENCY, ONCE YOU START TO USE LANGUAGE YOU MIGHT\nUSE IN A BAR RATHER THAN IN A PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE, YOU NEVER\nGO BACK. I THINK IT'S A POISON.\nI THINK IT'S TOXIC, AND THE COUNTRY IS GOING TO SUFFER.\n>> FRANK LUNTZ, THANKS VERY MUCH",

WE'RE LIVE IN AMERICA'S\nNEWSROOM. GOOD DAY TO YOU, MARTHA.\n>> WE'RE LIVE FROM WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY IN ST. LOUIS, THE\nGLORIOUS SITE OF TONIGHT'S BIG DEBATE.\nTRUMP'S BACK IS AGAIN THE WALL. HE NEEDS A KNOCK OUT, HAIL MARY,\nWHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT TONIGHT TO TRY TO GET THIS THING\nBACK ON TRACK FOR HIS CAMPAIGN. HOW WILL HILLARY CLINTON USE ALL\nOF THIS AGAINST HIM TONIGHT? ONLY TWO PEOPLE TRULY KNOW THE\nANSWER TO QUESTION. SO FAR NEITHER OF THEM IS\nTALKING, BILL. >> KELLYANNE CONWAY, REINCE\nPRIEBUS, CHRIS CHRISTIE ALL SCHEDULED TO APPEAR THIS MORNING\nAND THEY WERE ALL REPLACED BY MAYOR RUDY GIULIANI.\nI APPEARED ON ALL FIVE MAJOR NEWS.\n>> I'M NOT HERE TO DEFEND HIS COMMENTS.\nIF HE WERE HERE, HE WOULDN'T BE DEFENDING HIS COMMENTS.\nHIS COMMENTS WERE WRONG, THEY WERE VERY WRONG, AND\nREPREHENSIBLE. HE HAS SAID THAT.\nHE'S THE CANDIDATE THAT'S MUCH BETTER SUITED TO RUN THE COUNTRY\nTHAN HILLARY CLINTON WHO HAS HER OWN SET OF FLAWS.\n>> AND SPEAKING OF HILLARY CLINTON, DEALING WITH\nCONTROVERSY OF HER OWN FROM OVER THE WEEKEND.\nTHESE LEAKED SPEECHES TO WALL STREET SHOWING A DIFFERENT SIDE\nTO THE CANDIDATE. MORE ON THAT IN A MOMENT.\nFIRST I WANT TO START WITH JOHN ROBERTS BACK THERE LIVE IN\nST. LOUIS WHO IS FOLLOWING THE TRUMP TEAM.\nJOHN, LET'S START THERE. GOOD DAY.\n>> Reporter: BILL, GOOD AFTERNOON TO YOU.\nDONALD TRUMP, NOT SURPRISINGLY, DEFIANT IN THE FACE OF CALLS FOR\nHIM TO STEP DOWN. YESTERDAY OUTSIDE OF TRUMP TOWER\nACTUALLY LEAVING TRUMP TOWER, GOING OUT ONTO THE SIDEWALK ON\nFIFTH AVENUE. I HAVE BEEN OUT THERE ON FIFTH\nAVENUE SO MANY DAYS TO COVER THIS CAMPAIGN, AND HE HAS NEVER\nWALKED OUT FRONT BUT A THRONG OF PEOPLE TO SHOW HIS SUPPORT.\nHE'S WAVING TO THE CROWD, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, WE'RE GOING TO\nCONTINUE ON. IN THE FACE OF PEOPLE LIKE KELLY\nAYOTTE AND JOHN McCAIN, JOHN THUNE, THE LEADERSHIP SAYING\nTHEY WILL NO LONGER SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP AND THAT HE SHOULD\nPROBABLY STEP DOWN. DONALD TRUMP ISSUED THIS TWEET,\nQUOTE, SO MANY SELF-RIGHTEOUS HYPOCRITES WATCH THEIR POLL\nNUMBERS AND ELECTIONS GO DOWN. THE STRATEGY AT LEAST IN THE\nEARLY GOING BEFORE THE DEBATE TONIGHT IS TO DISAVOW DONALD\nTRUMP'S REMARKS AND THEN SAY, HEY, LET'S GET PAST IT.\nLISTEN TO WHAT HIS WIFE MELANIA SAID IN A RELEASE YESTERDAY.\nQUOTE, THE WORDS MY HUSBAND USED ARE UNACCEPTABLE AND OFFENSIVE\nTO ME. THIS DOES NOT REPRESENT THE MAN\nTHAT I KNOW. HE HAS THE HEART AND MIND OF A\nLEADER. I HOPE PEOPLE WILL ACCEPT HIS\nAPOLOGY AS I HAVE AND FOCUS ON THE IMPORTANT ISSUES FACING OUR\nNATION AND THE WORLD. BEYOND THAT NOW LEADING TOWARD\nTHE DEBATE THEY ARE FOCUSING IN ON HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHE CONTENTS OF THESE E-MAILS FROM JOHN PODESTA THAT WERE\nHACKED ACCUSING HER OF SAYING ONE NING IN PUBLIC AND THEN\nPURSUING VERY DIFFERENT POLICIES BEHIND CLOSED DOORS.\nLISTEN TO WHAT RUDY GIULIANI TOLD CHRIS WALLACE EARLIER THIS\nMORNING. >> WE HAVE TWO CANDIDATES THAT\nHAVE FLAWS. NOW, LET'S GET TO THE ISSUES.\nWHO ARE GOING TO BE BETTER ON THE ISSUES?\nSHE FOUGHT SO HARD TO KEEP THOSE SECRET AND WE NOW KNOW WHY.\nIF SHE HAD RUN THE WAY SHE RAN ON THOSE TAPES FOR ALL THOSE\nBANKERS -- SHE GOT PAID MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR SAYING THAT\nSTUFF. THIS IS STUFF SHE GOT PAID FOR.\nSHE WOULD NOT BE THE CANDIDATE. >> BILL, YOU MENTIONED THE\nELEPHANT IN THE ROOM, AND THERE IS SOME INFORMATION OUT THERE\nTHAT THE FIRST THING THAT THE MODERATORS WILL TALK ABOUT AT\nTONIGHT'S DEBATE AT WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY IS THAT TAPE FROM\n2005. DONALD TRUMP HAS TO HAVE A\nREALLY GOOD ANSWER FOR THAT OR IT'S GOING TO BE ALL DOWNHILL\nFROM THERE. SO WE'LL SEE WHAT HE SAYS.\n>> HE'S BEEN TWEETING UP A STORM THIS MORNING, JOHN.\n>> Reporter: HE HAS. >> AND RETWEETING AS WELL.\nTHERE WERE STORIES WRITTEN LAST NIGHT THAT THERE WAS TURMOIL\nINSIDE OF TRUMP TOWER. WHAT CAN YOU SAY ABOUT THAT\nREPORTING FROM INSIDE? >> Reporter: WELL, I MEAN,\nCLEARLY, BILL, WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS, IT'S GOING TO\nCAUSE TURMOIL AND YOU HAVE TO KNOW THIS PROBABLY HIT THEM\nHARDER THAN THEY EVER THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD.\nON FRIDAY CALLS WERE BEING MADE FROM TRUMP OFFICIALS TO VARIOUS\nNEWS ORGANIZATIONS. I FIELDED ONE OF THEM.\nKIND OF GAUGING THE TEMPERATURE OF JUST HOW BIG A STORY THIS WAS\nGOING TO BE. YOU KNOW, THERE WERE REPORTS\nTHAT MIKE PENCE WAS THINKING OF LEAVING.\nREPORTS THAT KELLY ANN CON WISCONSIN WAS THINKING OF\nLEAVING. RIGHT NOW THE TEAM REMAINS IN\nPLACE BUT IT'S STILL EARLY HOURS.\nI THINK A LOT WILL TURN ON HOW GOOD A PERFORMANCE DONALD TRUMP\nPUTS IN TONIGHT. THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO\nBELIEVE IF HE IS TO SURVIVE ANOTHER DAY, HE'S GOT TO HAVE\nTHE PERFORMANCE OF HIS NIGHT TONIGHT.\n>> PENCE REFERRED TO THAT AS GETTING THIS THING BACK ON TRACK\nAGAIN. THANK YOU.\nJOHN ROBERTS LIVE IN ST. LOUIS. BACK TO MARTHA NOW.\n>> ALL OF THIS, OF COURSE, MAKES THE STAKES TREMENDOUS TONIGHT\nFOR BOTH OF THESE CANDIDATES. TRUMP MAY NOW BE DEALING WITH\nTHE BIGGEST CHALLENGE HE HAS FACED YET.\nCHRIS, WHAT DOES HE HAVE TO DO TONIGHT AND CAN HE SAVE IT?\n>> FIRST OF ALL, ISN'T THIS A HELL OF AN ELECTION.\n>> UNBELIEVABLE. >> I DID NOT THINK IN MY LIFE --\nI HAVE NOT LIVED A GOOD ENOUGH LIFE TO DESERVE TO GET TO COVER\nAN ELECTION THIS CRAZY. >> WE KNOW THAT.\n>> THAT IS A CLEAR FACT. BUT, LORDY DAY.\nWHAT DOES HE NEED TO DO TONIGHT TO GET BACK ON TRACK?\nI THINK WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO TONIGHT TO GET BACK ON TRACK IS\nTO BE HUMANE, KIND, GENTLEMANLY, AND DECENT.\n>> BUT HOW DOES HE DISPATCH WITH THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM?\n>> HE HAS TO SAY IT. YOU HAVE TO EAT THE WHOLE\nELEPHANT. YOU HAVE TO SAY, I'M SORRY, I\nWAS WRONG. REMEMBER HERE, THE CONTROVERSY\nISN'T ABOUT HIM USING LOCKER ROOM TALK.\nTHE CONTROVERSY HERE IS ABOUT HIM BRAGGING, AND THAT HE IS NO\nEVIDENCE THAT HE DID IT, BUT HIM  POTENTIALLY A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.\nIF HE REALLY DID WHAT HE SAID HE DID, IT WOULD BE A HUGE DEAL.\nHE NEEDS TO APOLOGIZE, TAKE OWNERSHIP, AND THEN HE NEEDS TO\nBE KIND. HE NEEDS TO BE HUMANE AND HE\nNEEDS TO BE DECENT. BUT THE SIGNALS COMING OUT OF\nTRUMP AND TRUMP TOWER RIGHT NOW ARE FULL MO MONTE, ACCUSE BILL\nCLINTON OF RAPE, TALK ABOUT HUMA ABEDIN.\n>> HIS CAMPAIGN ALWAYS GETS ON BETTER GROUND WHEN HE TALKS\nABOUT THE ISSUES, ABOUT THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA, WHEN HE TALKS\nABOUT THE BORDERS, WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT JOBS.\nWHEN HE TALKS ABOUT REGULATIONS IN THIS COUNTRY.\nTHAT'S WHERE HE'S ON THE STRONGER GROUND.\nIF HE WASTES HIS TIME GOING INTO TERRITORY THAT'S BEEN\nUNSUCCESSFUL FOR HIM BEFORE -- >> RIGHT.\n>> -- CAN HE SUCCEED DOING THAT THIS TIME?\n>> NO. SO THE MUTUALLY ASSURED\nDESTRUCTION -- TRUMP HAS BEEN THREATENING, THREATENING,\nTHREATENING, IF YOU TALK ABOUT ME OF COURSE I'M GOING TO TALK\nABOUT YOU. HE MADE THE THINLY VEILED THREAT\nWHEN HE WAS ON STAGE AT HOFSTRA, HE SAID THERE ARE THINGS I\nWANTED TO SAY BUT I JUST COULDN'T DO IT BECAUSE THEY'RE\nSO TERRIBLE. WELL, NOW WE COME TO THE MOMENT\nWHERE NOT THE WORST THING IMAGINABLE BUT A VERY BAD THING\nHAS BEEN PUT OUT ON DONALD TRUMP AND NOW HE HAS TO CHOOSE.\nDOES HE TAKE HIS MEDICINE, SAY I'M SORRY AGAIN, HE HAS TO\nREPEAT I'M SORRY, MOVE ON AND BE GRACIOUS.\nHE HAS A VERY WINNING WAY ABOUT HIM WHEN HE CHOOSES TO BE, A\nWINSOME, KIND, SLIGHTLY SELF-EFFACING.\nIF YOU REMEMBER THE INTERVIEW HE DID WITH MEGYN KELLY, HE WAS\nQUITE CHARMING IN THAT INTERVIEW.\nIF HE WAS BRING THAT HERE TONIGHT, YEAH, HE COULD DO\nSOMETHING GOOD. >> HERE IS THE PROBLEM FOR HIM.\nHE COULD COME OUT TONIGHT AND SAY, LOOK, AMERICA, I'M THAT\nGUY. I'M THAT OBNOXIOUS GUY.\nYOU KNOW ME. >> UNCLE DON. >> YOU HAVE A FRIEND LIKE ME.\nYOU HAVE SOMEONE IN YOUR FAMILY LIKE ME.\nI WANT TO MAKE EVERYBODY LAUGH AND STAY STUFF THAT IS REALLY\nAWFUL -- >> BUT I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.\n>> RIGHT. BUT THE ONLY WAY HE CAN SAY THAT\nIS IF THERE'S NOTHING WORSE OR IF THERE'S NOT A WOMAN WHO IS\nGOING TO COME OUT AND SAY, YES, HE DID THAT TO ME.\nIF HE'S GOOD ON ALL THAT OTHER STUFF, HE COULD SAY I'M THAT\nGUY, AND LET'S MOVE ON. >> WE'VE HEARD FROM BEN CARSON\nAND NOW HEARD THREATS THERE'S MORE AND MORE AND MORE THAT'S\nGOING TO KEEP COMING UP OUT AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM.\nSO THAT'S WHY YOU'VE GOT -- LOOK, IN POLITICS THE THING\nABOUT DEALING WITH A SCANDAL IS YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT ALL THE\nWAY THROUGH. YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT ALL THE WAY\nDOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LINE AND BE FINISHED WITH IT.\nWITNESS HILLARY CLINTON'S FAILURE TO DEAL WITH HER E-MAIL\nSCANDAL. SHE TRIED TO BLOW IT OFF, AND IT\nHAS JUST HOUNDED HER AS A CONSEQUENCE.\n>> IS THIS MASTERFUL CLINTON OPO WE'RE SEEING HERE?\nLOOK AT THE TIMING. YOU HAVE THE MISS UNIVERSE\nTHING -- >> THAT WAS GOOD.\nTHAT WAS A CLINTON KABLOOEY. >> AND HE DIDN'T RESIST.\n>> THERE'S BEEN A PATTERN. HER WIKILEAKS COMES OUT.\nTHERE COULD BE MORE. SHE MAY HAVE SOMETHING IN HER\nQUIVER FOR EVERY SINGLE THING THEY'RE GOING TO COME OUT WITH.\n>> THE OTHER THING HERE IS WHETHER THIS WAS INTENTIONAL OR\nPLANNED OR WHATEVER, DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE IT'S SO\nSALACIOUS. IT'S GOT SEX IN IT.\nIT'S GOT FAMOUS PEOPLE IN IT. IT'S GOT CELEBRITY.\nIT'S GOT ALL OF THAT STUFF. THIS IS JUST CATNIP, AND THE",

WITH THE PAST 48 HOURS AND ALL\nTHAT HAS TRANSPIRED, THIS IS GOING TO BE FASCINATING TO SEE\nHOW BOTH CANDIDATES DEAL WITH THE REVELATION, DON'T FORGET,\nTHERE ARE OTHER REVELATIONS THAT HAVE COME OUT ABOUT THE WICK KI\nLEAKS E-MAIL, THERE HAVE BEEN TWEETS FROM DONALD TRUMP LINKING\nTO A VERY EMOTIONAL INTERVIEW WITH JUANITA BRODERICK, WHO'S\nACCUSED BILL CLINTON OF SEXUALLY ASSAULTING HER YEARS AGO, BUT\nALL OF THIS IS FLYING AROUND, SETTING TOUP THIS DEBATE AND I\nJUST, YOU CAN'T OVERSTATE HOW EXPLOSIVE THAT COULD BE.\n>> OBVIOUSLY, HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO MANAGE THAT ISSUE.\nTHIS VIDEOTAPE AND IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS HIM TO ADDRESS IT MORE\nSUCCESSFULLY PERHAPS THAN HE DID OTHER NIGHT.\nPEOPLE FELT HE WASN'T CONTRITE ENOUGH IN THE STATEMENT HE MADE\nAND DIDN'T MENTION HIS WIFE FOR ONE THING.\nSHE'S GOING TO BE SIT NG THERE TODAY, BUT HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN\nBETTER WHEN HE MAKES IT ABOUT THE ISSUES, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\nABOUT THE COUNTRY. ABOUT HIS VISION FOR THE FUTURE.\nSO HE'S GOT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO DO THAT.\n>> THAT HAS BEEN THE CHALLENGE FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nIS NOT TO GET DRAWN INTO THE DETAILS OF THE DEFENSE, BUT HE\nHAS TO GO DOWN THAT ROAD TONIGHT AFTER ALL OF THE REACTION ACROSS\nTHE BOARD. TO THAT AUDIO TAPE FROM ACCESS\nHOLLYWOOD. EVEN HIS SUPPORTERS WHO WERE NOT\nCOMPLETELY PLEASED WITH THE APOLOGY THAT HE ISSUED ON TAPE\nALREADY. SO, EXPECT THAT TO BE A BIG\nPART. THE INTERESTING THING WILL BE\nHOW HILLARY CLINTON DEALS WITH IT.\nAND WHETHER SHE BRINGS IT UP, GOES ON THE OFFENSE OR STANDS\nBACK AND LETS YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING EVOLVE.\nTHE X FACTOR HERE IS THAT THIS IS A TOWN HALL AND YOU HAVE TO\nINTERACT WITH PEOPLE AND REALLY CONNECT ONE-ON-ONE.\nTHE BEST PEOPLE AT IT. FORMER MR. BILL CLINTON WAS ONE\nOF THE BEST IN THIS SETTING. WE'LL SEE HOW THESE TWO DO\nTONIGHT WITH THESE EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES.\n>> AND YOU SAW THE INSIDE OF THE DEBATE HALL.\nIT IS VERY INTIMATE IN THERE. YOU THINK ABOUT THE CHAIRS OF\nTHE 40 PEOPLE. NOW ABOUT HALF AS MANY PEOPLE\nSITTING IN THE ACTUAL QUESTIONING AREA.\nWHEN YOU THINK ABOUT HOW BIG AND EXPLOSIVE THE STORIES ARE WE'RE\nDEALING WITH AND IMAGINE THEM REVERBERATING AGAINST THE PEOPLE\nAND WALLS OF THAT SMALL SPACE, IT IS A FASCINATING POLITICAL\nMOMENT. >> AND LISTEN, IT'S ALSO THE\nNONVERBAL EXCHANGES THAT HAVE HAPPENED IN THIS HAVE DEBATE\nHALL. THE STUFF CAUGHT ON CAMERA THAT\nAFFECTS A DEBATE OR THE PER SEPG OF IT.\nREMEMBER H.W BUSH LOOKING AT HIS WATCH, THAT WAS HERE.\nWHERE AL GORE WALKS ACROSS TO THEN GOVERNOR BUSH AND GETS IN\nHIS FACE. THAT HAPPENED HERE.\nAND SO, THE NONVERBAL CAMERA SHOTS AND THE REACTION TO WHAT\nIS GOING TO BE JUST, IT HAS TO BE EXPLOSIVE TALK ON ALL SIDES.\nBECAUSE IF DONALD TRUMP IS SAYING WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO VIA\nTWITTER, WHICH IS GO DOWN THE ALLEGATIONS AND PAST OF BILL\nCLINTON AND THEN HILLARY CLINTON, WHAT SHE HAD SAID ABOUT\nTHOSE WOMEN WHO WERE MAKING THE ALLEGATIONS, THIS THING, WHO\nKNOWS WHAT HAPPEN, MARTHA. IT COULD GO OFF THE RAILS REALLY\nQUICKLY. >> HE'S ALSO GOING TO HAVE TO BE\nSOMEWHAT RESPECTFUL OF HER. THE DAMAGE THAT'S BEEN DONE WITH\nWOMEN VOTERS COULD BE REFLECK ND THE WAY HE TREATS HER, SO HE'S\nGOT TO GO AFTER HER, BUT MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T LOSE ANYTHING IN\nTERMS OF HOW HE LOOKS AT HER OR HOW HE SQUAWKS AT HER.\nALL THAT NONVERBAL STUFF YOU SEE IN THE TOWN HALL ENVIRONMENT IS\nVERY POWERFUL AND I DON'T KNOW AS A BRAND-NEW POLITICIAN\nRELATIVELY, THAT'S SOMETHING HE'S MASTERED.\n>> RIGHT. THAT WILL BE YOU KNOW, PART OF\nTHE WHOLE DEAL. HE'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN ON TV A LOT\nOF HIS LIFE, SO HE RECOGNIZES THE CAMERA AND THE REACTION TO\nIT. YOU KNOW, AS WE TALK ABOUT MANY\nTIME, THIS POSITION AS A CHANGED ELECTION. LOOK AT THE POLLS AND\nANTIESTABLISHMENT, THE FEELING ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND THE\nABILITY TO SAY WE'RE THE CANDIDATE, THE PROBLEM NOW IS\nTHAT WHETHER DONALD TRUMP CAN GET OVER CONVINCING PEOPLE THAT\nHE IS THAT CHANGE. AND HE CAN ACTUALLY BE IN THE\nOVAL OFFICE. IT'S A MUCH MORE UPHILL BATTLE\nTODAY THAN IT WAS EVEN TWO DAYS AGO WHERE THE POLLS BEFORE THIS\nMOMENT WERE GOING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION FOR THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN. >> YES.\nWHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE CONVERSATIONS WE HAD GOING INTO\nTHE FIRST DEBATE, IT WAS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FEELING.\nSORT OF LIKE THE WINDOW WAS AT HIS BACK, SO WE COULD BE\nSURPRISED TOMORROW MORNING WHEN WE LOOK BACK ON TONIGHT, BUT WHO\nKNOWS. IT'S ANYBODY'S BALL GAME, SO\nWE'LL SEE. THANK YOU SO MUCH.\nLOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOUR REPORTING AS YOU'RE ANCHORING\nTHIS EVENING. >> THE HILLARY CLINTON CHALLENGE\nIN THIS, DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTERS ENCOURAGING THEIR NOMINEE TO\nFIGHT BACK AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON, SAYING KEEP THE FOCUS\nON HER RECORD. WELL, A FORMER ADVISER TO BILL\nCLINTON AND KATIE PAVE LISCH IS THE NEWED EDITOR FOR\nTOWNHALL.COM. YOU HOW DOING?\n>> FINE. >> HAPPENTY SUNDAY.\n>> TO YOU AS WELL SHLGS MY DEAR. >> STEVEN MEISTERS WRITES ON\nFOXNEWS.COM. TRUMP NEEDS TO LAY OFF THE SIDE\nSHOWISHES. NO ONE CARES ABOUT A FORMER MISS\nAMERICA OR ROSIE O'DONNELL. THOSE ISSUES WILL ESCAPE VOTER'S\nMINDS FASTER THAN HILLARY CAN DELETE 30,000 E-MAILS.\nMOVE ON, DONALD. WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT TRUMP\nTODAY. WHAT DOES SHE NEED TO DO\nTONIGHT? WHAT IS HER MISSION?\n>> WELL, WE HAVE NEW NEWS THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS TWO\nDIFFERENT PERSONALITIES. SO, AGAIN, HERE WE ARE IN\nANOTHER DEBATE WHERE HILLARY CLINTON IS GOING TO HAVE TO\nCONVINCE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT SHE'S EXPERIENCED, NOT AN\nELITIST OR WASHINGTON INSIDER. I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE\nDIFFICULT PR FOR HER. THE OTHER THING, TOO, THIS IS A\nTOWN HALL FORUM AND IN THE PAST, WE'VE SEEN HILLARY CLINTON GET\nDEFENSIVE WHEN IT COMES TO REGULAR PEOPLE ASKING HER\nQUESTIONS ABOUT HER OWN BEHAVIOR.\nFOR EXAMPLE, THERE WAS A NAVY VETERAN WHO QUESTIONED HER\nPREVIOUS TOWN HALL SAYING LOOK, IF I HAD DONE WHAT I\nWITH MY E-MAILS OR ANY KIND OF CLASS IF FIED INFORMATION WHEN I\nWAS IN THE NAVY WITHOUT SECURITY CLEARANCE, I WOULD BE IN PRISON.\nWHY DO YOU GET A PASS? I THINK HILLARY CLINTON HAS TO\nDO A GOOD JOB",

LOUIS, SO, WHAT DO SOME OF\nTHE STUDENTS HERE THINK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON\nAND THE CONTROVERSY OF THE ELECTION SEASON.\nI FOUND OUT WHEN I TALKED TO THEM YESTERDAY.\n>> MY TAKE ON THAT IS THAT THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE SHADY\nTHINGS THAT HAPPEN IN POLITICS AND YOU CAN'T REALLY EVER ESCAPE\nIT. WHETHER IT'S SOMEONE SAYING\nNEGATIVE B ABOUT WOMEN OR SOMEONE NOT -- THEIR TAXES.\nALWAYS SOME SORT OF SECRCY BECAUSE EVERYONE HAS SECRETS.\nNO ONE IS PERFECT. AT THE SAME TIME, THAT'S NOT\nNECESSARILY SOMETHING THAT SHOULD STOP YOU FROM ELECTING\nSOMEONE TO BE PRESIDENT. >> THERE'S ONE THAT'S APOLOGIZED\nAND I THINK FOR MOST PEOPLE, WE SEE DONALD TRUMP HAS NOT\nACKNOWLEDGED HIS MISTAKES. HE HAS NOT GAVE A A VERY SINCERE\nAPOLOGY. LOOK AT THE ONE LAST NIGHT.\nIT WAS IMMEDIATELY P PUSHING THE BLAME ON TO SOMEONE ELSE AND\nTHAT MEANS A LOT TO US. >> THOSE TWO YOUNG WOMEN ARE\nHILLARY SUPPORTERS, ALTHOUGH THE ONE ON THE LEFT SAID SHE HAD\nBEEN ON THE FENCE FOR A LONG TIME, BUT SOME OF THIS SORT OF\nPUSHED HER OVER TOWARDS HILLARY'S SIDE.\nTHEY RUN A BUSINESS HERE ON CAMPUS.\nVERY BRIGHT YOUNG WOMEN. A LOT OF HILLARY SUPPORT IN\nGENERAL, BUT IT IS A LITTLE DEPRESS NG A WAY TO HEAR ALL OF\nTHESE YOUNG PEOPLE SAYING YEAH, THAT'S JUST THE WAY POLITICS IS.\nWE DON'T REALLY EXPECT MUCH MORE THAN THAT FROM POLITICSES.\n>> WE HAVE ON THE BATTLEGROUND STATES NOW, WE'VE ALLOCATED\nVOTES TO HILLARY CLINTON. 270 IS THE MARK YOU NEED TO GET\nTO. SEE A ROT OF STATES IN YELLOW\nTHE DIRECTOR OF VIRGINIA'S CENTER FOR POLITICS.\nI WAS ON YOUR WEBSITE, THE CRYSTAL BALL.\nYOU ARE MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN WE ARE.\nYOU'VE GOT HER WELL ABOVE 300. HOW COME?\n>> THAT IS CORRECT. HE'S AT 315 AND FRANKLY, THE WAY\nTHIS VIDEOTAPE CONTROVERSY IS PLAYING OUT, SHE'S PROBABLY\nGOING TO GO HIGHER THAN THAT. AT LEAST FOR THE TEMPORARY\nPERIOD OF TIME UNTIL THESE THINGS WEAR OFF, IN F THEY DO.\n>> OKAY, YOU WANT TO HAVE SOME FUN?\n>> PARDON ME? >> WANT TO HAVE SOME FUN?\n>> SURE. I'M ALWAYS UP FOR FUN WITH MAPS.\n>> YOU'VE GOT 30 DAY, RIGHT? SOME OF THIS CAN CHANGE.\nSOME BATTLEGROUNDS ARE STILL TIGHT.\nYOU WERE RIGHT THOUGH, THAT ALL THE SCENARIOS THAT ARE LAID OUT,\nSHE HAS AN EASIER PATH TO 270. YOU AGREE WITH THAT, RIGHT IN.\n>> MUCH EAIER. >> SO, WHAT DOES TRUMP DO?\nYOU STUDY GEORGIA. IF HE CAN WIN THERE.\nOUT HERE IN ARIZONA PERHAPS. UP UNTIL ABOUT A WEEK AGO RIGHT,\nHE HAD A LEAD IN NEVADA. I DON'T THINK YOU WOULD DISPUTE\nU THAT. PROBABLY ALSO IN THE STATE OF\nIOWA AS WELL. THEN YOU COME BACK TO THE EAST\nCOAST AND YOU KNOW, IF HE HAS A CHANCE OF FILLING IN THE MAP,\nTHERE IS A SCENARIO WHERE HE COULD DO THAT AND IT WOULD BE\nNOT AN EASY ORDER HERE. IT WOULD BE FLORIDA.\nOHIO. NOW, YOU'RE AT 250, SO HE'S GOT\n20 MORE TO GO, SO WHERE WOULD HE PICK THOSE UP?\nMAYBE NORTH CAROLINA STAYS REPUBLICAN.\nIF IT DOES, HE'S, IT'S JUST ABOUT FIVE AWAY, SO THIS IS A\nLITTLE BIT OF THE BALANCE WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT.\nHOW DO YOU SEE THAT THOUSAND? >> YEAH, YOU CAN DO IT IN A VERY\nSIMPLE WAY IF YOU WANT. YOU CAN SAY SINCE OBAMA CARRIED\nOHIO, FLORIDA AND PENNSYLVANIA, THREE REALLY BIG STATES, IF HE\nKEEPS ALL THE ROMNEY STATES, THAT INCLUDES NORTH CAROLINA AND\nFLIPS THOSEHREE T BIG STATES, FLORIDA, OHIO, PENNSYLVANIA,\nBOOM. HE'S AT 273.\nHE CAN DO IT ANOTHER WAY. HE'S GOT A RUST BELT STRATEGY.\nGOT A LOT OF SUPPORT AMONG BLUE COLLAR WORKERS,\nDISPROPORTIONATELY CONCENTRATED IN THE RUST BELT.\nSO, OHIO, PENNSYLVANIA, MICHIGAN, WISCONSIN.\nAND SAY HE LOSES ONE OF THOSE STATES.\nWELL, THERE ARE SOME SMALL STATES THAT COULD COMBINE TO\nHELP HIM. I AGREE WITH YOU.\nHE'S AHEAD IN IOWA, NEVADA IS VERY CLOSE.\nAND THERE WAS ONE POLL THAT HAD CLINTON UP ONLY THREE IN NEW\nHAMPSHIRE. SO, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN CONSTRUCT\nALL THESE THINGS YOURN MAP OR IN MY HEAD AND WE ENJOY DOING IT,\nBUT OF COURSE, THE REALITY SOMETIMES IS VERY DIFFERENT.\n>> LAST POINT HERE, YOU NOTICED A SHIFT AFTER THE FIRST DEBATE,\nDID YOU NOT? >> VERY MUCH.\n>> WHAT DID YOU COME UP WITH AFTER THAT?\n>> WELL, ESSENTIALLY, IT PUSHED CLINTON FROM A A MINIMUM.\nWE HAD HER AT 273. OVER THE 300 MARK.\nWE HAD HER AT 315. LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS TONIGHT.\nYOU KNOW, THE PRESSURE'S REALLY ON TRUCH.\n THE ACT OF CONTRITION AND THEN TAKING THE CASE TO HILLARY JUST\nTO KEEP PARTY STABLE. DOESN'T WANT ANY MORE\nDEFECTIONS. MAYBE HE DOES.\nTHIS DEBATE ALMOST NEVER THE SECOND DEBATE ATTRACTS MORE\nPEOPLE THAN THE FIRST. WELL, THIS YEAR HAS BEEN AN\nEXCEPTION TO EVERY RULE. WE MAY BE ON THE VERGE OF\nANOTHER RULE BREAKING. MAY GET MORE PEOPLE TONIGHT THAN\nFOR THE FIRST ONE. ZPL WOW, THAT WOULD BE NORTH OF\n85 MILLION. >> CORRECT.\nPOSSIBLE. I THINK THE IT'S POSSIBLE.\nABSOLUTELY THINK IT'S B POSSIBLE.\n>> THANK YOU, LARRY. NICE TO HAVE YOU.\n>> THANK YOU, BILL. >> BACK THE TO ST. LOUIS AND\nMARTHA. >> GOT HIS WORK CUT OUT FOR HIM\nAS HE PREPARES TO GO TO BATTLE. >> YES, HE'S BEEN PREPARING AND\nALL THIS RECENT DEVELOPMENTS HAS GOT TO HAVE BROKEN THE PLANS OF\nTHAT HE HAD TO FOCUS ON CERTAIN OTHER ISSUES, SO IT'S GOING TO\nBE AN INTERESTING EVENING. HE'S GOING TO HAVE A VERY\nDIFFICULT CHALLENGE, BUT THE MAN IS TALL EPTED AND STRONG,\nCOURAGEOUS. >> ONE OF HIS BIGGEST SUPPORTER,\nJEFF SESSIONS. WHAT WILL HE SAY, HOW WILL HE\nTACKLE THE ISSUE? IT COULD BE THE VERY FIRST\nQUESTION OUT OF THE THE GATE TONIGHT.\nNOW THE DEBATE JUST HOURS AWAY. WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY IN ST.\nLOUIS.",

THE PEOPLE WILL BE ASKING\nQUESTIONS TO YOU TO BE THE, SO, IN TERMS OF THE MODERATOR, THEY\nHAVE TO SORT OF WALK THAT LINE. DO THEY INTERJECT, FOLLOW UP ON\nSOMEONE'S QUESTION FROM THE AUDIENCE?\n>> RIGHT. BEFORE ALL THIS EXPLODED,\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS A LITTLE BIT OF AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE SHE HAS\nMORE EXPERIENCE. YOU HAVE TO REALLY KIND OF FEEL\nAND ADDRESS PEOPLE'S CONCERNS AND LOOK THEM IN THE EYE.\nAT THE SAME TIME, IT'S PROBABLY THE HARDEST KIND OF DEBATE TO\nMODERATE BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A WHOLE LIST OF QUESTIONS YOU WANT\nTO GET TO AND PEOPLE ASK ABOUT ISSUES AND HOW THEY AFFECT A\nTHEIR LIVES.

AND JUST UP THE ROAD, ABOUT 20\nMILES FROM HERE IS HILTON HEAD, SOUTH CAROLINA.\nRIGHT ACROSS THE BORDER. RIGHT ACROSS THE SAVANNAH RIVER.\nWE TRIED TO GO THERE TODAY BECAUSE HILTON HEAD TOOK THE EYE\nOF THIS STORM. WE JUST GOT SIDESWIPED.\nCOULDN'T GET IN, BUT FOUND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ON THE SIDE\nOF THE HIGHWAY WAITING TO GET INTO HILTON HEAD.\nSOME HAVE BEEN THERE FOR 24 HOURS.\nJUST SITTING ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD WAITING FOR POLICE AND\nOFFICIALS TO LET THEM FINALLY GO BACK HOME AFTER THE STORM.\n>> YOU KNOW, ROB, THERE ARE FOUR DEAD IN GEORGIA.\nAND I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE AT THE SCENE OF ONE OF THOSE DEATHS\nLAST NIGHT. WHAT DID YOU SEE?\n>> WELL, THAT WAS A REALLY HEARTBREAKING STORY.\nWENT INTO THIS NEIGHBORHOOD, REALLY GREAT PEOPLE IN THIS\nNEIGHBORHOOD AND THEY TOLD US A GENTLEMAN HAD STAYED BACK HIS\nFAMILY HAD EVACUATED. TWO LITTLE KIDS AND WIFE HAD\nTAKEN OFF. HE STAYED WITH THE HOUSE AND A\nMASSIVE PINE TREE. SHOW YOU THE PICTURE.\nTRUNK OF THIS TREE WAS HOW SO HUGE, CAME RIGHT DOWN ON THE\nHOUSE AND LANDED ON THE MASTER BEDROOM, KILLING THAT MAN.\nSOMEWHERE IN HIS 40s. HIS NEIGHBORS TALKED ABOUT\nGETTING A PHONE CALL FROM THIS WIFE THAT MORNING THEY FOUND HIM\nTELLING HIM, HEY, GO CHECK ON THE HOUSE.\nI HAVEN'T HEARD FROM MY HUSBAND. >> I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH JC.\nAND I SAW A TREE ON HOUSE AND I TOLD HER THAT, THERE'S A TREE ON\nYOUR HOUSE. DOESN'T LOOK BAD.\nAND THEN I WALKED AROUND THE CORNER AND I COULD TELL, I TOLD\nHER WE'D HAVE TO CALL HER BACK. >> HE WAS A REALLY GREAT FATHER.\nSPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH HIS KIDS TAKING THEM UP AND DOWN THE\nSTREET, GOING TO THE POOL ALL THE TIME.\nREALLY JUST A SAD STORY AND REALLY INDICATES HOW MUCH YOU\nNEED TO TAKE THESE WARNINGS SERIOUSLY WHEN THESE EVACUATION\nORDERS GO INTO EKT. THAT STORM BROUGHT IN FIERCE\nWINDS AND RECORD STORM SURGES. WE'RE HEARING TONIGHT THEY'RE\nGOING TO LET PEOPLE COME BACK INTO SAVANNAH AROUND 5:00 P.M.\n>> IT'S TOUGH FOR A HOME OWN OWNER TO GET UP AND LEAVE.\nTHANK YOU. BACK TO ST. LOUIS NOW.\n>> THAT'S AN AWFUL, AWFUL STORY. SO, WE ARE HERE LIVE IN ST.\nLOUIS AT WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY AND IT IS COUNTDOWN TIME TO\nCLINTON VERSUS TRUMP IN WHAT MAY BE THE MOST IMPORTANT MOMENT OF\nTHIS CAMPAIGN YET, THE BATTLE THAT'S ABOUT TO GET UNDERWAY.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS A LOT ON HIS PLATE TONIGHT AS HE TRIES TO\nTURN THE SHIP AROUND AMID GROWING CONTROVERSY.\nSO, WHAT DOES HE NEED TO DO HERE TONIGHT AT WASHINGTON\nUNIVERSITY?

SAID TERRIBLE THINGS ABOUT THIS\nPOOR WOMAN WHO'S STILL OUT THERE.\nTHEN YOU TAKE ALL OF THE WOMEN THAT BILL CLINTON ASSAULTED IN\nVARIOUS WAYS AND THE FACT HILLARY CLINTON'S SPENT $100,000\nOF REAL MONEY TRYING TO DIG UP DIRT ON THESE WOMEN JUST TO MAKE\nTHEIR LIVES MORE HORRIBLE THAN THEY WERE.\nYOU LOOK AT THAT AND THINK THERE ARE WORDS AND ANCHORS AND WHICH\nIS MORE DAMAGING. IT COMES DOWN TO THE ISSUES.\nSHE WANTS OPEN BORDERS. WANTS OPEN TRADE.\nSHE SAID THAT TO GOLDMAN SACHS. ADMITTED, YOU WON'T BELIEVE THE\nTHINGS, WHAT I REALLY NEED IS WHAT I'M SAYING TO YOU NOW.\nYOU KNOW, FROM A CAMPAIGN PERSPECTIVE, A LOT PROBABLY\nMAKES GOOD SENSE. BUT THE WOMEN WHO FLIF THE\nSUBURBS IN PHILADELPHIA, CINCINNATI, THESE ARE THE WOMEN\nFRANKLY, PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND ME. THEY'RE MOM, EDUCATED AND MANY\nARE INDEPENDENT VOTERS WHO HAVE BEEN ON THE FENCE AND THEY'VE\nGONE BACK AND FORTH A FEW TIMES IN THE POLLS.\nTHAT'S WHO HE NEEDS TO CONVINCE. SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CONTENT,\nHE HAS TO GET PAST THAT MOMENT. IF HE CAN.\nAND WHAT HE TALKS ABOUT IN IT. SOME PEOPLE ARE CALLING THAT\nTHAT HE'S CONDOING ASSAULTS. SO, WHAT DOES HE NEED TO SAY\nABOUT THE WORDS HE USES AND VULGARITY OF THE COMMENTS IN\nORDER TO PUT THOSE WOMEN IN THOSE AREAS AT EASE?\n>> I THINK THOSE WOMEN ARE PROBABLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAM\nTHINGS YOU AND I ARE CONCERNED ABOUT.\nTHEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE COLLEGE GRADUATE'S GOING TO BE\nABLE TO GET A JOB. THAT OPEN BORDERS MEAN SOMEONE\nIN THEIR FAMILY DIEDED. THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE\nTRAGEDY GOING ON OVERSEAS THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAD FACILITATED,\nTAKING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM THE CLINTS\nFOUNDATION FROM FOVR GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE VERY HOSTILE WAS.\nTHOSE KINDS OF THINGS AS A MOTHER, HE'S -- AND NO ONE\nSIGHED. THE PRESIDENT HE'S GOING TO\nBE -- >> HE CAN ARTICULATE THOSE\nTHOUGHTS, MAYBE HE'LL DO WELL TONIGHT, SO AS A SUPPORTER, I'M\nSURE HE'S LISTENING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nGOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US TODAY. >> YOU BET, 1:00 THERE IN ST.\nLOUIS, OUR SHOWDOWN TONIGHT, ONLY SEVEN HOURS AWAY.\nKEEP IT HERE ON FOX BECAUSE THIS DEBATE WILL BE ONE OF THE FINAL\nOPPORTUNITIES FOR TRUMP AND CLINTON SHAPE THE STORY OF THIS\nRACE. IN A MOMENT, THE FEW REMAINING\nIMPORTANT DATES ON THE CALENDAR WITH ONLY 30 DAYS TO GO.\nBACK LIVE IN ST. LOUIS IN IN STO J IN MIDTOWN MANHATTAN AS OUR\nCOVERAGE CONTINUES.",

GOP STRATEGIST CARL ROWE.\nMAUREEN DOUD, AUTHOR OF THE NEW BOOK, THE YEAR OF VOTING\nDANGEROUSLY AND BOY, IS IT. AND JASON RILEY OF THE WALL\nSTREET JOURNAL. CARL, LET ME START WITH YOU AND\nTHE RULES OF OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\nTRUMP SAYS HE IS NOT DROPPING OUT AND APPARENTLY IT IS ALMOST\nIMPOSSIBLE. MAYBE YOU TELL ME I'M WRONG FOR\nTHEM TO FORCE HIM OUT. I KNOW THAT THE HOUSE GOP IS\nGOING TO HAVE A CONFERENCE CALL TOMORROW MORNING TO DISCUSS ALL\nOF THIS. HOW SERIOUSLY IS THE IDEA OF\nTRYING TO FIND SOME WAY EITHER BY FORCE OR PERSUASION TO GET\nDONALD TRUMP TO DROP OUT. >> THERE ARE TWO STEPS TO THIS.\nTHEY CAN'T FORCE HIM OUT, BUT THEY COULD DECLARE HIM SOME HOW\nINELIGIBLE. REALISTICALLY, THE REPUBLICAN\nNATIONAL COMMITTEE CAN'T REPLACE HIM UNLESS HE WITHDRAWS THEN THE\nMEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE CAN REPLACE HIM.\nTHE SECOND PROBLEM IS THE STATES.\nWE'RE VOTING IN MORE THAN A DOZEN STATES.\nTHE ABSENTEE BALLOTS IN SEVERAL LOCATIONS AND SEVERAL DOZEN\nMORE. THERE ARE BALLOTS PREPARED IN\nVIRTUALLY EVERY STATE AND IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE, VIRTUALLY\nIMPOSSIBLE TOREPLACE DONALD TRUMP IF HE WERE TO DECIDE TO\nRESIGN ON MOST STATE BALLOTS. >> IS THIS THING TALKED ABOUT\nSERIOUSLY IN REPUBLICAN CIRCLES? DOZENS OF GOP LEADERS, MEMBERS\nOF CONGRESS, MEMBERS OF THE SENATE, TALKING ABOUT HIM\nSTEPPING DOWN. >> I WROTE ABOUT THIS IN MAY\nWHEN WE WERE CONTEMPLATING MAY. I'M NOT A LAWYER.\nAFTER TALKING TO A LOT OF LAWYERS IT IS VIRTUALLY\nIMPOSSIBLE TO REPLACE SOMEBODY IN AUGUST, LET ALONE IN OCTOBER\nAND IF HE WERE TO DECIDE TO DO IT IT WOULD TAKE A WEEK TO GET\nTHE NATIONAL COMMITTEE TOGETHER. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LITERALLY\nTWO OR THREE WEEKS BEFORE THE ELECTION AND AT THAT POINT,\nVIRTUALLY EVERY STATE IS SENDING OUT ABSENTEE BALLOTS OR HAVING\nEARLY VOTING OR BOTH. >> MAUREEN, I'M SITTING HERE,\nREADING MY NEW YORK TIMES ON SATURDAY MORNING, LEAD STORY,\nTHE F BOMB, EXPLICIT DESCRIPTIONS OF WOMEN'S ANATOMY,\nTHESE ARE FROM DONALD TRUMP. I SEE THE PEOPLE SAYS ALL OF THE\nNEWS THAT IS FIT TO PRINT. I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS.\nWHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE GRAY LADY AND IS THIS ALL JUST A\nPROMOTION FOR YOUR NEW BOOK? >> YES, CHRIS, I THINK TRUMP'S\nLASTING LEGACY ASIDE FROM DESTROYING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY\nWILL BE CHANGING THE NEW YORK TIMES IN THESE PROFOUND WAYS.\nFOR THE FIRST TIME, WE'VE CHANGED OUR POLICY AND CALLED\nPOLITICIANS LIARS AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES LIARS\nWHICH WE NEVER DID. I WAS ALWAYS HAVING TO LOOK UP\nSYNONYMS WHEN I WAS WRITING ABOUT DICK CHANEY.\nNOW WE CHANGED THE POLICY AGAIN SO THANK YOU, DONALD TRUMP.\n>> AND A CONTRIBUTION TO THE LEGACY OF THE TIMES AND OUR\nCULTURE. WE ASK YOU FOR QUESTIONS AND WE\nGOT A BUNCH AND SHARPLY DIVIDED OPINIONS ABOUT THE TRUMP TAPE.\nALL MEN SAY THINGS TO EACH OTHER THEY WOULDN'T WANT ANYONE ELSE\nTO HEAR. GET ON WITH THE REAL PROBLEMS OF\nTHE COUNTRY. BUT MELINDA STEIN HOUSE THINKS\nI'VE BEEN A FAN OF TRUMP BUT UNFORTUNATELY, I THINK HE SHOULD\nSTEP DOWN. THE GOP EDPRESIDENT.\nTHERE IS TOO MUCH AT STAKE WITH THE SUPREME COURT.\nTRUMP'S CRUDE COMMENTS ABOUT WOMEN ARE NOTHING NEW.\nI GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE IS WHY IS THIS THE TIPPING POINT?\nWHY IS THIS THE POINT IN WHICH A LOT OF PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY\nREPUBLICAN OFFICIALS ARE SAYING THAT'S IT.\n>> I THINK PARTLY THIS IS SELF PRESERVATION.\nI THINK THERE IS A LOT OF MESSI -- PESSIMISM ABOUT TRUMP'S\nWINNING. MAYBE DISTANCING OURSELVES FROM\nTRUMP WILL HELP US DO THAT. THERE IS EXHAUSTION SETTLING IN\nON TRYING TO DEFEND THE STUFF. SOME STOP STOPPED BUT NEVER DID\nIT IN THE FIRST PLACE. SOME ARE WAITING FOR HIM TO GROW\nUP. IT HASN'T HAPPENED IN THE FIRST\n70 YEARS IN HIS LIFE. I DON'T THINK IT IS GOING TO\nHAPPEN IN THE NEXT 30 DAYS AND THEY'RE DONE WITH HIM.\n>> WHAT ABOUT THIS IDEA OF HIM DROPPING OUT, NOT THAT THE ARE E\nPLACEMENT WOULD NECESSARILY BE ABLE TO BEAT CLINTON, BUT IT\nMIGHT SAVE THE HOUSE, THE REPUBLICAN HOUSE AND THE\nREPUBLICAN SENATE. >> THERE IS, THAT IS ONE\nSCENARIO. BUT ANOTHER SCENARIO, AND A\nSCARY ONE IF YOU'RE ONE OF THESE REPUBLICAN OFFICIALS IS DONALD\nTRUMP NOT GOING QUIETLY AND SAYING TO HIS SUPPORTERS, I TOLD\nYOU THE SYSTEM WAS RIGGED. NOW TAKE IT OUT ON THE GOP UP\nAND DOWN THE BALLOT. THAT IS A RISK.\n>> YOU KNOW, ALL OF THIS IS PLAYING OUT AS WE SHOULD POINT\nOUT, ALMOST LIKE A MOVIE, LIKE A MAUREEN DOWD BOOK, HOURS BEFORE\nTHE SECOND PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE. THE QUESTION IS IS THERE\nANYTHING YOU CAN SEE WITH RUDY GUILIANI NOT COMBATIVE, VERY\nREGRETFUL OF WHAT HE HAD SAID, REMORSEFUL AND SAYING, BUT LET'S\nGET TO THE ISSUES. IS THERE ANYTHING TRUMP CAN DO\nTO TAKE SOME OF THE STING OUT OF THIS?\n>> I THINK THE FIRST THING HE HAS TO DO, WELL, ACTUALLY, THREE\nRISKY STRATEGIES. ONE, IGNORE IT.\nI THINK RUDY GUILIANI WAS TRYING TO SAY.\nIT IS A NONISSUE. THE MAN APOLOGIZE.\nSECOND IS SAYING IT IS OVER PLAYED BY MY OPPONENT LEAKING\nTHIS MATERIAL. THE MAINSTREAM PRESS IS OUT TO\nGET ME AND THERE IS MORE TO COME AND ALL OF THAT.\nAND GET BACK TO THE IDEA THAT HE IS THE GREAT DISRUPTER.\nHE IS HERE TO DISRUPT AMERICAN POLITICS.\nBUT THE THIRD POSSIBILITY IS TO GO AFTER BILL CLINTON.\nWE SAW THIS IN ONE OF HIS APOLOGIES.\nI HEARD WORSE ON THE GOLF COURSE FROM BILL CLINTON.\nWHAT IF HE GOES DIRECTLY AT CLINTON AND THE IDEA THAT MRS.\nCLINTON HAS BEEN PART OF THE TEAM THAT DISPARAGES WOMEN\nINVOLVED WITH HER HUSBAND. WHAT HAPPENS THEN?\nHOW DOES HILLARY CLINTON RESPOND?\nHOW DOES THE AUDIENCE. IT IS A TOWN HALL.\nHOW DO THE INDIVIDUALS THERE RESPOND?\nI THINK THAT IS A VERY RISKY STRATEGY GIVEN THAT WE KNOW NOT\nONLY ABOUT THE TAPE BUT MISS UNIVERSE, THE THINGS THAT HE\nSAID ABOUT MEGYN KELLY AND THE REST.\nI THINK IT WILL BE AN EXPLOSIVE. >> YOU'VE ADVISED POLITICIANS,\nYOU'VE BEEN IN THIS SPOT HOURS BEFORE THE DEBATE.\nOBVIOUSLY NEVER QUITE THIS SITUATION, BUT IF YOU'RE SETTING\nTHE AIR, THE SENIOR ADVISOR TO DONALD TRUMP, WHAT WOULD WE SAY?\n>> WE SAW IT IN RUDY GUILIANI, ONLY SINCERE WORDS OF CONTRITION\nWILL ALLOW HIM TO BEGIN TO SALVAGE THIS.\nTO SAY THAT IT IS -- THIS ISSUE IS BIGGER THAN HIM, THAT HAD I\nEXPERIENCE OF RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT HAS TAUGHT HIM THE\nENORMOUS RESPONSIBILITIES HE BEARS AS THE SPOKESMAN FOR THIS\nMOVEMENT AND TRY TO REFOCUS IT ON THE BIG ISSUES.\nIT IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE SINCERE AND HONEST AND EVERYBODY\nIS GOING TO JUDGE THAT. THE TAPE AT 12:00 A.M., SATURDAY\nMORNING APOLOGY TAPE, THAT DIDN'T COME ACROSS AS SINCERE,\nTHAT CAME ACROSS AS DEFIANT AND COMBATIVE AND IT NEEDS TO BE\nSINCERE CONTRITION AND EVEN THEN IT IS GOING TO BE HARD.\nHE HAD A NARROW WINDOW TO WIN. I THINK THAT IS CLOSING BECAUSE\nIT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO ATTRACT SWING VOTERS.\n>> REAL QUICKLY, IF HE WERE TO DO OPTION THREE OF BROTHER\nWILLIAMS OVER HERE AND GO AFTER THE CLINTONS.\n>> MISTAKE. WHAT IT SIMPLY SAYS I'M JUST AS\nBAD AS HE IS AND HE IS AS BAD AS ME BUT HIS NAME IS NOT ON THE\nBALLOT. IT IS HILLARY CLINTON AND SHE\nCAN SIMPLY SAY, NOT ON THE BALLOT.\nLET'S REMEMBER THIS. THIS IS PROBABLY NOT THE LAST OR\nTHE WORST DUMP THAT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS TO GO.\nHE NEEDS TO SET-UP FOR WHAT IS COMING DOWN THE ROAD.\nI'M A CHANGED MAN BUT I CHANGED IN THE LAST DECADE BUT I'VE BEEN\nCHANGED BY THE EVENTS OF THE LAST 14 MONTHS.\nYOU'RE ASKING ME TO CHANGE AMERICA.\nKEEP AMERICA FROM BEING TRANSFORMED IN FRONT OF YOUR\nEYES, I'LL DO THAT AND I'LL TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.\n>> COMING UP, HILLARY CLINTON FACES HER OWN PROBLEMS, HACKED\nE-MAILS THAT SHOW HER TAKING VERY DIFFERENT POSITIONS ON\nTRADE, BORDERS, AND WALL STREET IN BIG MONEY SPEECHES TO BANKERS\nTHAN WHAT SHE IS TELLING VOTERS. THAT IS NEXT.",

LET'S BRING IN DAVID GERGEN\nSENIOR ANALYST AND FORMER ADVISER TO FOUR PRESIDENTS.\nDAVID, IF IT WERE YOUR JOB TO RIGHT DONALD TRUMP'S REMARKS,\nTHAT HE WILL GIVE TOMORROW NIGHT IN THE DEBATE, HAVE YOU DONE\nTHIS FOR FOUR PRESIDENTS. YOU WROTE NIXON'S RESIGNATION\nLETTER, WHAT SHOULD COME OUT OF DONALD TRUMP'S MOUTH?\n>> I THINK HE HAS TO START BY DEALING WITH THE APOLOGY AND\nREPEAT IT IN A WAY AND MOVE OFF IT SO IT DOESN'T BECOME A\nREGULAR FEATURE OF IT. I'M NOT SURE HE CAN QUELL THIS\nSTORM BETWEEN NOW AND TOMORROW NIGHT.\nTHERE IS SO MUCH ANTICIPATION. WE COULD HAVE A BIGGER AUDIENCE\nTHAN THE FIRST DEBATE. >> A SUPER BOWL SIZE AUDIENCE.\nIF NOT BIGGER, PROBABLY. GIVEN THIS.\nWHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY WHAT ARE THE WORDS?\nWHAT IS THE CONTRITION WE HAVE TO SEE?\nTHAT WAS NOT IN THAT VIDEO LAST NIGHT.\n>> NO, WHAT YOU WANT TO HAVE IS, ONE FELT THAT THAT WAS A\nNEGOTIATED STATEMENT. WHAT HAPPENED FOR PEOPLE THAT\nTHOUGHT HE OUGHT TO BE VERY APOLOGETIC.\nTHE OTHER FOR DONALD TRUMP. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STATEMENT,\nHE SHIFTED TO BE THE FIGHTER AGAIN.\nHE NEEDS TO SHOW AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF CONTRITION, THE\nCOUNTRY HAS CHANGED ME, BUT I THINK IT'S PRESSURE FOR HIM TO\nRESIGN, I THINK HIS POLL NUMBERS WILL DROP TOMORROW.\nIT WILL LOOK LIKE HE'S -- SO YOU GOT A LOT OF REPUBLICANS, SO YOU\nDON'T WANT TO RESIGN. I THINK HE COULD LOOK BACK IF\nHISTORY AND LOOK AT ALL THINGS RICHARD NIXON'S EXECERRED SPEECH\nWHEN HE WAS A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE FOR DWIGHT EISENHOWER\nIN 1952, THERE WAS A LOT OF PREPARE FOR HIM TO GET OFF THE\nTICKET. HE WENT ON NATIONAL TELEVISION\nAND SAID IT'S UP TO YOU THE PUBLIC TO TELL ME WHAT TO DO.\nSHOULD I STAY OR SHOULD I FIGHT? HE GOT AN AVALANCHE OF LETTERS\nTO SAY FIGHT. TRUMP NEEDS SOMETHING LIKE THAT.\n>> THAT WOULD VERY MUCH BE IN STEP WITH TRUMP BEING THE\nOUTSIDER AND ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT. HE IS BLAMING THE MEDIA IN HIS\nLATEST TWEET FOR THIS. BILL CLINTON IS SPEAKING\nSOMEWHERE IN WISCONSIN FOR HIS WIFE.\nWE GOT REPORTING FROM THE CLINTON CAMP, SHE'S NOT GOING TO\nSAY WORD ABOUT THIS UNTIL SHE TAKES THE STAGE TOMORROW NIGHT.\nSHOULD BILL CLINTON SAY ANYTHING?\n>> NO, HE'S, THE REPUBLICANS HAVE A CRISIS ON THEIR HANDS\nRIGHT NOW. JUST LET THEM KEEP DIGGING AWAY.\nTHEY COULD EVEN HAVE A CIVIL WAR ON THEIR HANDS IF THEY'RE NOT\nCAREFUL. WHAT WAS INTERESTING ABOUT THAT\nPAUL RYAN RALLY, HOW MANY PEOPLE CAME AND SAID, WHERE THE HECK IS\nTRUMP? WHY DID YOU DISINVITE HIM, IN\nHIS HOME STATE, IT'S SO POWERFUL.\n>> HE IS A PARTY DIVIDED. SO HILLARY CLINTON WE KNOW WON'T\nSAY ANYTHING UNTIL SHE TAKES THE DEBATE STAGE TOMORROW NIGHT, OUR\nANDERSON COOPER WILL BE MODERATING.\nWHAT DOES HILLARY CLINTON SAY? IF YOU THINK BACK TO THE PRIMARY\nWHEN CARLEY FIORINA, WHEN TRUMP WAS SAYING ABOUT HER PEACE, SHE\nSAYS I THINK EVERY AMERICAN WOMAN KNOWS WHAT HE MEANT.\nSHE LEFT IT AT THAT. >> IT MAY BE THAT HILLARY CAN\nFIND A MOMENT WHEN A WOMAN ASKS HER A QUESTION AND SHE CAN\nEXPLORE HER FEELINGS AS A WOMAN. THE EMOTION AMONG WOIM WOMEN IS\nVERY STRONG. I THINK HILLARY CAN ARGUE, THERE\nMAY BE A SILVER LINING IN ALL OF THIS BEFORE IT'S OVER, THE\nCOUNTRY MAY FINALLY COME TO GRIPS WITH THE ASSAULTS AGAINST\nWOMEN THAT HAVE BEEN GOING ON, THE LANGUAGE THAT IS BEING USED.\nWOMEN EXPERIENCE THIS ALL THE TIME.\nTHEY DON'T SEE MUCH CHANGE AND MAYBE THIS WILL BE LIKE A CHANCE\nTHAT HILLARY MAY BE ABLE TO TAKE",

AS THE FIRST FEMALE PRESIDENT,\nHOW WOULD YOU UNDO SOME OF THAT DAMAGE AND HELP GIRLS UNDERSTAND\nTHEY ARE SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE?\n>> OH, THANK YOU. THANK YOU.\n>> THE EXCHANGE GOT PICKED UP EVERYWHERE, INCLUDING \"NEW YORK\nTIMES\" THAT IDENTIFIED THE GIRL AS DAUGHTER OF A DEMOCRATIC\nSTATE REPRESENTATIVE. HE'S A STATE SENATOR AND SAID HE\nHAD HELPED SHAPE THE QUESTION BUT DIDN'T NAME HIM OR SEE A\nREASON TO FURTHER CONNECT THE DOTS.\nWELL, AS YOU COULD WELL IMAGINE, PLENTY OF MEDIA OUTLETS TOOK\nTHAT FACT AND RAN WITH IT. ACCUSED HIM AND HIS DAUGHTER\nBRENNAN OF BEING PAID PLANTS, SOMETHING THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN\nHAS BEEN ACCUSED OF IN THE PAST. HERE'S MEGYN KELLY'S TAKE.\n>> NEW QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN MAY\nBE PLANTING QUESTIONS AT HER EVENT.\n>> A LITTLE EDITORIALIZING THERE WITH THE FACIAL EXPRESSION.\nTHE OUTRAGE AND BACKLASH OVERWHELMED THE ORIGINAL STORY\nAND OBLITERATED THE CONTENT, PART OF THE PROCESS TO TURN IT\nINTO A CIRCUS BUT EVERYBODY DID THIS WITHOUT ASKING THE GIRL OR\nHER FATHER. SO I'M ABOUT TO RECTIFY THAT.\nJOINING ME NOW IS DAELEN AND BRENNAN.\nARE YOU AN ACTRESS? >> LOOK, IF YOU CONSIDER A\nCOUPLE OF SCHOOL PLAYS AND A VIDEO FROM MY FRIEND'S MOM\nACTING, THEN, I LOVE THEATER. I'VE BEEN PASSIONATE ABOUT IT\nSINCE I WAS A KID BUT IN NO WAY WAS I APPROACHED BY HILLARY'S\nCAMPAIGN OR ASKED THE QUESTION.

SO COMPLETELY UNRELATED AND\nNEVER BEEN INVOLVED IN BOTH AT THE SAME TIME.\n>> DID DAD WRITE IT FOR YOU? DID HE PROD YOU IN ANY WAY?\n>> NOT AT ALL. I MEAN, THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT'S\nREALLY IMPORTANT TO ME. BODY IMAGE IS SOMETHING REALLY\nRELEVANT TO GIRLS MY AGE AND WHEN A PUBLIC ICON LIKE DONALD\nTRUMP IS CALLING WOMEN UGLY, FAT, WOMEN, PIGS, JUDGING THEM\nON HOW THEY LOOK, IT DOES AFFECT US.\nIF YOU THINK YOU'LL SPEAK IN FRONT OF THE FUTURE PRESIDENT,\nYOU WILL HAVE YOUR PARENTS LOOK AT IT AND I PRACTICED IT A\nCOUPLE TIMES. HE DEFINITELY HELPED ME SORT OF\nCOMPOSE MYSELF AND FIX MY WORDING BUT OTHER THAN THAT, IT\nWAS MY IDEA AND I CAME UP WITH IT ON MY OWN.\n>> DAELIN, THE FACT SHE WAS ABLE TO ASK THE FIRST QUESTION CAUSES\nMOST PEOPLE SO SAY, THE WHOLE THING MUST HAVE BEEN A SET-UP.\n>> WHAT HAPPENED IS, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS\nAND THEY OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS, OFTEN, PEOPLE ARE\nRELUCTANT TO RAISE HANDS. THE FIRST QUESTION IS SORT OF\nAWKWARD. ONCE THEY DO, YOU HAVE 20 OR 30\nPEOPLE AT A TIME. SHE OPENED IT UP, BRENNAN RAISED\nHER HAND A LITTLE BIT. SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE TO RAISE\nHER HAND. SHE RAISED IT HIGHER.\nELIZABETH BANKS, SITTING UP AT THE FRONT IN THE SPECIAL\nQUESTION FOR OPEN OFFICIALS. I WASN'T EVEN NEXT TO HER AND\nELIZABETH BANKS CALLED ON HER. AND SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE RAISED\nHER HAND. THERE'S NO GRAND CONSPIRACY\nHERE. >> THIS WEEK, THERE WERE\nREVELATIONS THAT STEVE HARVEY SHARED HIS QUESTIONS WITH HER IN\nADVANCE WITH SECRETARY CLINTON IN ADVANCE, AND SO IT\nPERPETUATES THE IDEA THAT WHAT WE VIEW AND THINK IS SPONTANEOUS\nIS OFTEN NOT THE CASE. YOU COULD SEE HOW THIS STORY GOT\nCAUGHT UP IN THE NARRATIVE. >> WELL, YEAH, BUT I WISH PEOPLE\nLIKE MEGYN KELLY AND OTHERS, IT'S MOSTLY THE RIGHT WING MEDIA\nWOULD HAVE AT LEAST FACT CHECKED.\nJOURNALISM 101, CALLED AND ASKED US BECAUSE THERE WAS NO\nPLANNING. THERE'S ALL KINDS OF STUFF IN\nCRAZY MEDIA OUTLETS HOW WE WERE PAID AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING.\nNONE OF THAT IS REMOTELY TRUE. THIS WAS A SPONTANEOUS QUESTION\nFROM A GIRL WHO CARES DEEPLY ABOUT AN ISSUE AND THAT'S ALL IT\nWAS. BASIC JOURNALISM WOULD HAVE\nUNCOVERED THAT. DID INVESTIGATE THIS AND FOUND\nTHAT THIS WASN'T A PLANT BUT WE HAVE BEEN GETTING SO MUCH SORT\nOF OUTRIGHT HATE FROM TRUMP SUPPORTERS.\nI'VE GOTTEN OVER 30,000 TWITTER MESSAGES, ALL KINDS OF STUFF ON\nFACEBOOK, THREATS, REALLY HORRIFIC SUGGESTIONS ABOUT\nBRENNAN. I MEAN, AT SOME POINT, HUMAN\nDECENCY SHOULD TAKE PART. >> YOU LOST A FRIEND AND PART OF\nYOUR MINDSET IN FASHIONS THIS QUESTION.\nSPEAK TO THAT. >> IT'S NOT MY PLACE TO TALK\nABOUT THAT AND WHO THAT PERSON WAS.\nI WAS NOT AUTHORIZED TO DO THAT. BUT YES, I MEAN, IT'S NOT JUST\nME. IT'S NOT JUST MY EXPERIENCE.\nWHEN I ASKED THAT QUESTION, I WAS SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF, YOU\nKNOW, MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOLERS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.\nYOU KNOW, IT REALLY DOES DAMAGE US.\nTHIS IS OUR MOST INSECURE TIME IN LIFE AND TO HAVE SOMEONE THAT\nWE'RE SUPPOSED TO LOOK UP TO BE INSULTING WOMEN AND AS YOU SAW\nON THE TAPES TODAY, REALLY JUST BRUTAL HARASSMENT, IT'S HORRIBLE\nAND IT DOES TRICKLE TO US. I DON'T THINK A LOT OF ADULTS\nREALIZE HOW MUCH IT AFFECTS THEIR KIDS AND THE YOUNGER\nGENERATION. SO A LOT OF THE OTHER ISSUES\nDON'T AFFECT ME, BUT I KNOW THAT THIS ISSUE IS REALLY IMPORTANTLY\nAND IT'S NOT TALKED ABOUT AS MUCH AS IT SHOULD BE.\nSO TALKING TO HILLARY WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME AND I'M REALLY\nGLAD I GOT THE OPPORTUNITY. >> BRENNAN AND DAYLIN LEETCH,\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.\n>> THANK YOU.",

I WAS TRYING TO PROMOTE \"THE\nAPPRENTICE,\" \"CELEBRITY APPRENTICE.\"\nTHAT'S WHAT WE DO, GO ON THE HOWARD STERN SHOW TO GET\nVIEWERS. IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT GENRE.\n>> AND HE'S USED THAT EXCUSE TIME AND AGAIN.\nHE WAS ALSO KEENLY AWARE ABOUT THE HOWARD STERN SHOW IN\nPARTICULAR. HE KNEW HE HAD DONE IT A LOT AND\nSAID SOME THINGS THAT MAY NOT BE SEEN AS WHAT A PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATE WOULD SAY. BUT HERE'S WHAT I WOULD ARGUE,\nWOLF. EVERYTHING IS A NEW CONTEXT NOW,\nRIGHT? SO AFTER THE BOMBSHELL THAT WE\nGOT WITH THE CAUGHT ON TAPE MOMENT WITH THE ACCESS\nHOLLYWOOD/BILLY BUSH INTERVIEW, NOW HAVING MORE OF THESE HOWARD\nSTERN TAPES EMERGE, FOR THE FIRST TIME HEARING IT WITH THE\nCONTEXT ALL AMERICAN VOTERS HAVE WITH SEEING THE \"ACCESS\nHOLLYWOOD\" TAPE, IT'S A WHOLE NEW LEVEL.\nI DON'T KNOW THAT IT GETS DISMISSED AS JUST HAVING BEEN IN\nENTERTAINMENT AT THE TIME. MAYBE THAT WOULD HAVE WORKED A\nFEW MONTHS AGO. I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO\nWORK ANYMORE AS AN EXCUSE. >> WE HAVE A CLIP OF IVANKA, HIS\nDAUGHTER, SAYING HER DAD IS NOT A GROPER, IF YOU WILL.\nLET ME PLAY THAT. >> BUT YOU HAVE WORKED SO\nCLOSELY WITH YOUR DAD. THERE'S ANOTHER WOMAN WHO IS\nQUOTED IN THE ARTICLE THAT SAYS THAT DONALD TRUMP GROPED HER AT\nA MEETING, AT A BUSINESS MEETING.\n>> YEAH. WELL -- LOOK, I'M NOT IN EVERY\nINTERACTION MY FATHER HAS BUT HE'S NOT A GROPER, THAT'S NOT\nWHO HE IS. I'VE KNOWN MY FATHER OBVIOUSLY\nMY WHOLE LIFE AND HE HAS TOTAL RESPECT FOR WOMEN.\n>> GLORIA, THAT WAS FROM CBS BACK IN MAY FOLLOWING THAT \"NEW\nYORK TIMES\" REPORT THAT DOCUMENTED ALL THESE WOMEN\nCOMING FORWARD AND SAYING THAT HE HAD GROPED THEM, IF YOU WILL.\nSO ALL OF A SUDDEN THIS HAS REALLY EXPLODED.\n>> RIGHT. AND SHE ALSO SAID TO ME THAT HER\nFATHER WASN'T A SEXIST AND TOOK GREAT OFFENSE WHEN I ASKED THAT\nQUESTION. I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW DIFFICULT\nTHIS IS FOR HER. SHE HAS COME OUT IN THIS\nCAMPAIGN AND MADE WOMEN'S ISSUES, CHILD CARE, CHILDREN'S\nISSUES, A BIG PART OF THIS CAMPAIGN.\nSHE CAME OUT AT THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION AND SPOKE ABOUT IT,\nTALKED ABOUT HER FATHER'S DEVOTION TO THOSE ISSUES.\nAND NOW -- AND BY THE WAY, THESE ADULT CHILDREN ARE VERY INVOLVED\nIN THE RUNNING OF THIS CAMPAIGN AND IVANKA IS AMONG THEM.\nAND NOW THEY FIND THEMSELVES SORT OF IN THE GILDED TOWER\nTHERE DOING DAMAGE CONTROL AGAINST -- FOR THEIR FATHER,\nTRYING TO -- AND THEIR FATHER HAS BECOME AN INCREASINGLY\nISOLATED AND DEFIANT CANDIDATE, ISOLATED FROM THE REPUBLICAN\nPARTY. AND EARLIER ON IN THE SHOW,\nWOLF, YOU PLAYED A CLIP OF RUDY GIULIANI SAYING IT WAS THE\nOUTSIDERS VERSUS THE INSIDERS. I WOULD ARGUE AT THIS POINT IT'S\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\nTHE ENTIRE REPUBLICAN PARTY. IT'S NOT JUST THE ESTABLISHMENT,\nIT'S PEOPLE WHO HAVE ENDORSED HIM AND ARE NOW UNENDORSING HIM.\nAND BY THE WAY, THAT HAS NOW BECOME A WORD, UNENDORSING,\nRIGHT? >> IT HAS, IT HAS.\nBUT TO DAVID'S POINT ABOUT THE CONTEXT OF THIS, OF COURSE\nEVERYBODY KNEW DONALD TRUMP AS THE CELEBRITY.\nEVERYBODY KNEW THAT THERE WERE MOMENTS WHERE HE WAS\nINAPPROPRIATE OR, YOU KNOW, TRYING TO BE A SHOWMAN AND SO\nFORTH. BUT IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT\nHAPPENED WITH THE TAPE THAT CAME OUT YESTERDAY, TO HEAR HIM\nTALKING ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER LIKE THAT IS JUST -- IT TAKES CRINGE\nWORTHY TO A WHOLE OTHER LEVEL. IT'S TRUE.\nI'M A DAUGHTER, YOU'RE A DAUGHTER, JUST IMAGINE THAT, TO\nHEAR THAT FROM YOUR DAD? IT JUST -- IT BLOWS YOUR MIND.\n>> BUT THEY HAVE ALWAYS EXCUSED IT IN THE PAST.\nOH, THAT'S MY FATHER, HE DOESN'T MEAN THAT.\n>> IT'S A SCHTICK. >> YEAH, HE'S AN ENTERTAINER.\nYES, SOMETIMES HE CAN BE INAPPROPRIATE.\nBUT WHAT WE SAW ON THE VIDEO YESTERDAY WENT BEYOND\nINAPPROPRIATE AND LEWD TO PREDATORY.\nAND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I AM SURE THAT HIS CHILDREN AND HIS\nWIFE, BY THE WAY, ARE GRAPPLING WITH.\nWE KNOW THAT MELANIA CAME OUT TODAY IN A STATEMENT OF SUPPORT\nSAYING THAT HER HUSBAND HAS APOLOGIZED.\n>> AND THAT SHE ACCEPTED THAT. >> THAT SHE ACCEPTED THE\nAPOLOGY, WHICH HILLARY CLINTON ACCEPTED BILL CLINTON'S APOLOGY\nAS WELL, IF YOU'LL RECALL, AND THAT WAS QUITE IMPORTANT TO BILL\nCLINTON'S POLITICAL FUTURE. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THIS WILL\nHAVE THE SAME IMPACT THAT THAT DID.\n>> BUT MELANIA IN THAT STATEMENT ALSO CALLED HIS WORDS\nUNACCEPTABLE IN THAT VIDEOTAPE. >> EXACTLY.\n>> HERE'S THE QUESTION THAT I HAVE RATTLING AROUND IN MY BRAIN\nHEADING INTO THE DEBATE TOMORROW NIGHT.\nHE'S NOW GIVEN A STATEMENT BOTH ON PAPER AND A VIDEO STATEMENT.\nAND IT HASN'T BEEN SUFFICIENT IN ANY WAY TO ACTUALLY MOVE BEYOND\nTHIS. AFTER THOSE STATEMENTS WERE OUT\nTHERE, WE SAW MORE REPUBLICANS, AS GLORIA SAID, UNENDORSE AND\nWALK AWAY FROM HIM. SO WHAT DOES HE COME PREPARED\nWITH TO TRY TO ADDRESS THIS IN FRONT OF TENS OF MILLIONS OF\nAMERICANS ON THE DEBATE STAGE IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS HIM TO MOVE\nBEYOND IT. THAT TO ME IS THE PIECE THEY\nHAVE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH AND I HAVE NO INDICATION AS TO WHAT HE\nMAY BE DOING DIFFERENTLY THAN WHAT HE'S ALREADY DONE.\nIF HE JUST REPEATS WHAT HE'S ALREADY SAID, I FIND IT HARD TO\nBELIEVE THIS IS GOING TO GO AWAY.\nI'VE GOT TO BELIEVE THIS IS NOT THE LAST ONE WE'RE GOING TO HEAR\nABOUT FROM NOW THROUGH THE NEXT 30 DAYS.\n>> AND THE QUESTION IS WHETHER HE IS CONSTITUTIONALLY ABLE TO\nDO WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO. TO SAY WHAT HE SAID, WHICH WAS\nOBVIOUSLY SCRIPTED FOR HIM LAST NIGHT IN A VERY CONTROLLED\nSETTING. THERE WERE NO REPORTERS AROUND.\nTHE VIDEOTAPE -- THEY BROUGHT A CAMERA IN, HIRED A CAMERA GUY,\nPUT IT UP ON SOCIAL MEDIA. WHETHER HE IS CONSTITUTIONALLY\nABLE TO DO A VERSION OF THAT AND THEN SOME, EXPAND ON THAT, WHILE\nHE'S GETTING INCOMING FROM FROM VOTERS, WHILE HE'S GETTING\nINCOMING FROM HILLARY CLINTON, AND SO TO BE ABLE TO STAY\nFOCUSED ON THAT AND THEN THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH HE PIVOTS,\nTO USE A WORD HE APPARENTLY HATES, TO THE ISSUES THAT HIS\nCAMPAIGN HATES THAT HE NEEDS TO STAY ON, WHICH IS, YEAH, BUT\nWHAT ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON ALLEGEDLY COMING CLOSE TO\nBREAKING THE LAW, ISN'T THAT WORSE THAN WHAT I DID?\nTHOSE ARE THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS THAT IT'S JUST UNCLEAR WHETHER\nHE HAS THE CAPACITY TO DEAL WITH.\n>> AND I WAS TALKING TO A REPUBLICAN TODAY WHO SUGGESTED\nKIND OF ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT HE OUGHT\nTO COME IN THERE AND HE OUGHT TO APOLOGIZE AND THEN HE OUGHT TO\nTAKE A TURN AND SAY NOW LET'S GET TO THE ISSUES THAT CONCERN\nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE HERE. AND SEE IF HE CAN -- IF HE CAN\nDO THAT. AND THAT'S -- THAT'S DIFFICULT\nFOR HIM, BECAUSE AS WE ALL KNOW DURING THIS CAMPAIGN,\nAPOLOGIZING DOES NOT COME EASILY TO DONALD TRUMP.\n>> THIS IS THE FIRST TIME HE'S DONE IT.\n>> HE HAS SAID BEFORE THAT HE EXPRESSED REGRETS ABOUT THINGS\nAND LAST NIGHT HE APOLOGIZED, BUT HE HAD TO DO IT BY PROMPTER.\n>> AND HE DOESN'T ALLOW ATTACKS TO GO BY.\nTHAT'S THE OTHER PIECE OF IT, RIGHT?\nSO IF HILLARY CLINTON COMES LOADED FOR BEAR ON THIS --\n>> WHICH SHE WILL. SHE WILL.\nAND SHE MAY JUST GIVE HIM ENOUGH ROPE, WHICH IS WHAT THEY HAVE\nBEEN DOING ALL DAY TODAY, BY HANGING BACK, NOT -- YOU KNOW,\nHILLARY CLINTON TWEETED INITIALLY, BUT SHE HASN'T LATELY\nBECAUSE THEY WANT TO GIVE HIM ENOUGH ROPE AND THEY WANT TO\nGIVE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY JUST ENOUGH SPACE TO CONTINUE TO\nATTACK THEIR OWN CANDIDATE, WHICH BY THE WAY, WHEN HAVE WE\nEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS? I MEAN IT REMINDS ME, ALTHOUGH\nOF COURSE I WASN'T BORN AT THAT POINT, OF THE RESIGNATION OF\nRICHARD NIXON. I'M ONLY JOKING.\nAND WHEN BEFORE RICHARD NIXON RESIGNED FROM THE WHITE HOUSE,\nYOU SAW THIS KIND OF DOMINO EFFECT.\nTHIS IS AN AVALANCHE HERE, AND WE SAW THAT BEFORE NIXON\nRESIGNED. BUT OF COURSE HE WAS AN\nINCUMBENT PRESIDENT. I DON'T RECALL ANYTHING LIKE\nTHIS FOR A PARTY'S NOMINEE. I REMEMBER WHEN BOB DOLE WAS\nRUNNING PEOPLE WERE DESERTING HIM BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT HE WAS\nGOING TO LOSE, BUT THEY WEREN'T TAKING AWAY THEIR ENDORSEMENT OF\nHIM OR THEIR MONEY. >> YOU SAID SOMETHING THAT'S\nIMPORTANT AND I'VE HEARD THIS IN MY CALLS AND CONVERSATIONS WITH\nREPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE STRATEGISTS ALL DAY\nTODAY, WHICH IS EVERYBODY WANTS TO PUT THE PAUSE BUTTON ON UNTIL\nSUNDAY NIGHT. BUT WHAT I CAN'T FIGURE OUT IS\nWHAT IS GOING TO BE THAT DIFFERENT THAT IS GOING TO MAKE\nREPUBLICANS CHANGE HOW THEY'RE APPROACHING HIM AND WHETHER OR\nNOT THE PARTY SAYS ENOUGH. >> LET'S SEE IF HE MAKES A\nSTATEMENT BEFORE, BEFORE -- >> I'M TOLD HE IS NOT DOING\nTHAT. >> HE GAVE INTERVIEWS WHERE HE\nSAID ZERO CHANCE OF HIM DROPPING OUT.\nHE'S IN THIS UNTIL THE VERY, VERY END.\nLET'S SEE IF HE MAKES ANY OTHER STATEMENTS.\nEVERYONE, STAY WITH US. WE HAVE A LOT MORE COMING UP ON\nTHIS SPECIAL \"CNN NEWSROOM.\" HOW DONALD TRUMP'S TROUBLES AND\nTHE PANIC INSIDE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY COULD IMPACT TOMORROW\nNIGHT'S CRUCIAL CLINTON/TRUMP DEBATE.\nWE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.",

HOW DID THAT APOLOGY GO OVER?\n>> IT WAS THE SECOND TIME HE TRIED TO APOLOGIZE AFTER THIS\nVIDEOTAPE. AND I THINK IT WAS TOO LITTLE\nTOO LATE.

A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THINK THEY'VE\nBEEN HIS BUST SUREST SURROGATES. MELANIA, THAT WOULD BE A GOOD\nCHARACTER WITNESS. I THINK THE BIGGEST THING HE\nNEEDS TO DO IS HE NEEDS TO TRY TO SHOW PARTICULARLY FEMALE\nVOTERS IN THOSE SUBURBS THAT THIS IS NOT THE PERSON HE IS AND\nTHAT'S GOING TO BE A DIFFICULT THING TO DO AFTER YOU'VE BEEN\nCAUGHT ON TAPE FOR DECADES MAKING THESE KINDS OF REMARKS.\n>> YOU KNOW, GLORIA, YOU HAD SOME INTERESTING REPORTING ABOUT\nMIKE PENCE, THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL RUNNING MATE, THAT\nTHERE'S PRESSURE ON HIM TO MAYBE THINK ABOUT DROPPING OUT.\n>> WOMEN, THIS IS A SCENARIO THAT SOME PARTY ELDERS ARE\nPLAYING OUT AND I SHOULD SAY THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF SCENARIOS\nTHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT AT THIS TIME.\nBUT I SPOKE WITH ONE WHO WAS SAYING TO ME, LOOK, WE'RE TRYING\nTO GET TO MIKE PENCE, TRYING TO GET HIM TO LEAVE THE TICKET\nBECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY TO APPLY PRESSURE ON TRUMP TO LEAVE\nBECAUSE THEN THEY BELIEVE THAT PENCE WOULD BECOME THE\nPRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE.

TRUMP TO\nAPOLOGIZE IN PERSON LIVE ON STAGE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.\n>> HOW MUCH -- HOW MUCH -- HOW MUCH ROAD DO YOU THINK THAT WILL\nBUY HIM, TARA, IF HE DOES IT? >> WELL, LOOK, I THINK IT'S --\nTHE LIKELIHOOD OF DONALD TRUMP HUMBLING HIMSELF IN FRONT OF THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE TOMORROW AND BEING, YOU KNOW, OFFERING\nHUMILITY AND CONTRITION IS SLIM TO NONE.\nIF ANY -- IF HIS BEHAVIOR IN THE LAST 48 HOURS IS ANY INDICATION\nOF WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO TONIGHT, THEN THAT'S NOT WHAT\nWE'RE GOING TO SEE. HE'S BEEN VERY DEFIANT UP UNTIL\nTHIS POINT. HIS PERSONALITY HAS NEVER BEEN\nTO APOLOGIZE FOR ANYTHING AND HUMBLE HIMSELF FOR ANYTHING.\nHE HAD A MENTOR IN ROY CONE WHO TAUGHT HIM WHO IS A RUTHLESS,\nRUTHLESS LAWYER WHO TAUGHT HIM NEVER TO APOLOGIZE FOR ANYTHING.\nSO WE'VE SEEN THAT THERE'S NOTHING TO INDICATE THAT'S HOW\nDONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO APPROACH THIS TONIGHT UNLESS --\nUNLESS EVERYTHING HE'S BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST TWO DAYS IS\nJUST A RUSE AND HE'S GOING TO SHOW UP A NEW CANDIDATE, A NEW\nPERSON, I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE THAT TONIGHT.\nIT'S CLEAR THAT THIS IS NOT ABOUT NECESSARILY RIGHTING THE\nSHIP FOR HIM BECAUSE IF IT WERE, HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN\nCONDUCTING HIS CAMPAIGN THIS WAY FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.\nI THINK DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT CARE ABOUT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY,\nTHAT'S CLEAR. HE'S GOING TO GO OUT THE WAY HE\nWANTS TO AND TO HELL WITH EVERYBODY ELSE.\nTHAT'S BEEN QUITE OBVIOUS, WHICH IS WHY THE PARTY AT THIS POINT\nHAS -- IS IN A TOTAL FREAKOUT MODE WHICH IS AN EXACT QUOTE\nFROM A FRIEND OF MINE WHO WORKS WITHIN WHAT GOES ON HERE.\nHE TOLD ME THEY ARE, QUOTE, FREAKING OUT.\nTHE PARTY IS LOOKING DOWN BALLOT AND HOW THIS WILL AFFECT HIM AND\nHOW IT WILL AFFECT OUR HOUSE AND SENATE RACES WHICH IS WHERE THE\nFOCUS NEEDS TO BE. THAT'S WHY THE RNC HAS HALTED\nFUNDING ANYMORE OPERATIONS FOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.\n>> SENATOR JOHN McCAIN TWEETED OUT, CINDY AND MYSELF WILL NOT\nVOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP. WE WILL NOT VOTE FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON, WE WILL WRITE IN THE NAME OF SOME GOOD CONSERVATIVE\nREPUBLICAN WHO'S QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT.\nWHO IS THAT, TARA? >> WELL, WE COULD GO DOWN A LIST\nOF A BUNCH OF FOLKS, UNFORTUNATELY, WHO LOST IN THE\nPRIMARY WHO WERE GOOD, SOLID, COMPETENT, CONSERVATIVE\nREPUBLICANS THAT DIDN'T MAKE IT OUT OF THE PRIMARY UNFORTUNATELY\nTHAT ARE MORE QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nANY ONE OF THEM. YOU KNOW, SOME FOLKS MIGHT EVEN\nWRITE IN MIKE PENCE. HE'S MORE QUALIFIED.\nUNFORTUNATELY, THIS IS THE SITUATION THAT THE PARTY HAS\nCHOSEN TO PUT THEMSELVES IN BECAUSE THEY REFUSED TO CALL\nDONALD TRUMP OUT FOR BEING UNFIT EARLY ON AND NOW THEY'RE WHERE\nTHEY ARE. AND THERE IS NO -- THIS IS --\nTHIS IS A FICTION IF THEY THINK THEY'RE GOING TO REPLACE TRUMP\nNOW. IT'S A VIRTUAL IMPOSSIBILITY.\nTHAT CAME AND WENT ON SEPTEMBER 1st.\nGOD BLESS JOHN McCAIN AND THOSE WHO HAVE FINALLY COME OUT AND\nSAID WE CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE AND FINALLY PUT SOME PRINCIPLE\nBEHIND THEIR ACTIONS, BUT IT'S A LITTLE LATE.\n>> SCOTTY, WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE DEBATE TONIGHT AND WHAT\nDONALD TRUMP MAY DO, WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT TONIGHT IS THAT\nHE WILL BE FACING VOTERS DIRECTLY.\nTHIS ISN'T ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON COMING AT HIM, THIS IS ABOUT\nREAL VOTERS ASKING REAL QUESTIONS THAT THEY HAVE ON\nTHEIR MIND. IS HE CAPE ABLE OF KEEPING IT\nUNDER CONTROL IN YOUR OPINION? >> ABSOLUTELY.\nTHIS IS WHERE HE'S GOING TO SHINE.\nI THINK THAT'S WHY WE SAW THIS REVELATION COME OUT ON FRIDAY.\nTHERE COULD BE ANOTHER REVELATION IF HE DOES VERY GOOD\nTONIGHT. POSSIBLY MORE TO COME --\n>> WHAT REVELATION ON FRIDAY NIGHT, SCOTTY?\n>> I'M TALKING ABOUT ON FRIDAY WHEN THEY CAME OUT WITH THE\nORIGINAL TAPES THAT CAME OUT FROM 2005.\nI THINK THAT'S THE REASON WHY THIS IS HAPPENING, BECAUSE THEY\nKNOW DONALD TRUMP, THE ONE GREAT THING, THIS IS THE REASON WHY HE\nWAS CHOSEN, WHY HE WON THE PRIMARY, BECAUSE IT WASN'T ABOUT\nTHE POLITICIAN'S ENDORSEMENTS, IT WAS ABOUT THE PEOPLE.\nIT IS A MOVEMENT OF THE PEOPLE. IT'S WHY DONALD TRUMP IS ABLE TO\nBEAT 17 OTHER CANDIDATES. THIS IS WHY I THINK ALL OF THESE\nOTHERS FALLING OUT, THEY WERE NEVER REALLY ON BOARD, WHY IT\nDOESN'T REALLY AFFECT. I THINK THE ISSUES OF PROTECTING\nTHE UNBORN, APPOINTING A JUDGE, OPPOSING THE IRAN DEAL AND\nECONOMIC FREEDOM ARE THE REASONS WHY MR. TRUMP AND THE PEOPLE\nRESONATE AND THE PROBLEM HILLARY CLINTON WILL HAVE WHEN IT COMES\nTO THE ISSUES. >> UNFORTUNATELY HE'S UNFIT TO\nEVER PUT ANY OF THOSE THINGS FORWARD.\nHE'S NEVER HAD ANY CONVICTION OR INVESTMENT IN THOSE ISSUES PRIOR\nTO NOW. >> WE'LL SEE, TARA.\nI'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT. WE'LL SEE WHAT THE VOTERS ASK\nHIM. WE ALWAYS APPRECIATE YOU BEING\nHERE. THANK YOU.\n>> THANK YOU.",

THIS OUR NATIONAL POLL OF POLLS,\nAN AVERAGING OF ALL THE NATIONAL POLLS CONDUCTED IN RECENT DAYS,\nTHESE ARE ALL SINCE THE FIRST DEBATE.\nLOOK, HILLARY CLINTON WITH A FOUR-POINT LEAD.\nTHE THIRD PARTY CANDIDATES PULLING A COMBINED 10 POINTS.\nFOUR POINTS THAT'S NOT MUCH, BUT LET'S GO BACK AND LOOK AT TIME.\n2012 WAS ACTUALLY A PRETTY COMPETITIVE RACE.\nHILLARY CLINTON TODAY IN BETTER SHAPE THAN PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS\nAT THIS POINT IN 2012. 30 DAYS OUT, THAT'S WHERE WE ARE\nTODAY, PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD A SLIM ONE-POINT LEAD OVER MITT\nROMNEY. THE DAY OF THE SECOND DEBATE THE\nDEBATES WERE LATER FOUR YEARS AGO.\nIT WAS OCTOBER 16th. THE TWO CANDIDATES WERE ACTUALLY\nTIED ON THE DAY OF THE SECOND DEBATE.\nSO TIED IN THIS RACE A FOUR-POINT LEAD IN THIS RACE, NO\nQUESTION SECRETARY CLINTON RIGHT NOW IN A BETTER POSITION AT THIS\nPOINT OF THE RACE THAN PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS FOUR YEARS AGO.\nESPECIALLY WHEN YOU GO AND TAKE A STATE BY STATE LOOK.\nTHIS IS OUR CURRENT ELECTORAL MAP.\nIF THE ELECTION WERE HELD TODAY, WE BELIEVE SECRETARY CLINTON\nWOULD WIN THE DARK BLUE AND LIGHT BLUE STATES.\nIF DONALD TRUMP WON TOSSUPS, IT WASN'T ENOUGH.\nHE WOULD HAVE TO TURN SOMETHING ON THIS MAP BLUE RED.\nJUST IN THE LAST WEEKS POLLS IN NEVADA SHOWING CLINTON AHEAD.\nPOLLS IN OHIO THE LATEST HAS CLINTON WITH A SMALL LEAD.\nPOLLS SHOWING CLINTON PULLING SLIGHTLY AHEAD IN NORTH CAROLINA\nAND IN FLORIDA. AT THE MOMENT, DONALD TRUMP\nNEEDS TO WIN THEM ALL, SHE'S LEADING IN THEM ALL.\nYOU CANNOT OVERSTATE THE STAKES TONIGHT FOR TRUMP.\nHIS TEAM SCHEDULED A PRACTICE SESSION THE OTHER DAY IN NEW\nHAMPSHIRE. TRUMP INSISTS THAT'S NOT WHAT IT\nWAS AT ALL. >> THEY'RE SAYING THIS IS\nPRACTICE FOR SUNDAY. THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH\nSUNDAY. WE'RE HERE BECAUSE WE JUST\nWANTED TO BE HERE AND, YOU KNOW, HILLARY FRANKLY THEY TALK ABOUT\nDEBATE PREP. THAT'S NOT DEBATE PREP.\nSHE'S RESTING. SHE'S RESTING.\nI WANT TO BE WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\nI WANT TO BE WITH THE PEOPLE FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE.\nSHE WANTS TO WIN. >> NOW, LET'S REMEMBER THAT\nEVENT WAS BEFORE THIS WHOLE CAUGHT ON TAPE MOMENT BROKE,\nEVEN BEFORE THAT, THE STAKES WERE PRETTY HIGH TONIGHT.\nWHAT DOES DONALD TRUMP SAY BEHIND US ON THIS STAGE TONIGHT\nWHEN THIS ISSUE COMES UP. I ASSUME IT COMES UP OUT OF THE\nGATES. >> THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE BEEN\nHUDDLED TRYING TO FIGURE OUT OVER THE LAST 24, 48 HOURS.\nTHIS IS NOT AN EASY FORMAT. THE TOWN HALL FORMAT FIRST OF\nALL THE TOWN HALL HE HAD IN NEW HAMPSHIRE THE OTHER NIGHT WAS\nNOT A TOWN HALL BY ANY STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION.\nYOU DON'T GET LIKE HAND FED FRIENDLY QUESTIONS AT A NEW\nHAMPSHIRE TOWN HALL. BUT THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS\nTHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IN THIS KIND OF FORMAT.\nYOU HAVE TO APPEAL TO THE AUDIENCE MEMBERS.\nYOU HAVE TO SHOW EMPATHY. YOU HAVE TO AT THE SAME TIME\nLAND YOUR ATTACKS ON YOUR OPPONENT AND DONALD TRUMP HAS\nTHIS WHOLE OVERLAY OF POTENTIALLY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS\nCOMING UP THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE COURSE OF THE EVENING.\n>> CAN HE GO WHERE HE'S GONE IN SOME OF THESE STATEMENTS?\nIN HIS FIRST PAPER STATEMENT ISSUED BY THE CAMPAIGN AND THEN\nIN THE VIDEO HE RELEASED AND THEN YESTERDAY HE TWICE\nRETREATED -- RETWEETED EXCUSE ME A WOMAN WHO SAYS 30 PLUS YEARS\nAGO BILL CLINTON SEXUALLY ASSAULTED HER.\nCAN HE DO THAT? I UNDERSTAND SOME PEOPLE FEEL\nSTRONGLY ABOUT THE PAST AND EVERYTHING, BUT THE QUESTION\nBEFORE US TODAY IS HIS BEHAVIOR. >> HE CAN DO THAT, RIGHT?\nHE CERTAINLY HAS DONE IT OFF STAGE.\nTHE PEOPLE AROUND HIM, PEOPLE LIKE ROGER STONE, PEOPLE LIKE\nBAN NON, PEOPLE LIKE RUDY GIULIANI, IT SEEMS LIKE THEIR\nINSTINCT WILL BE TO GO THERE. WE'LL HEAR FROM RUDY GIULIANI\nLATER TODAY. KELLY ANCONWAY HASN'T BEEN OUT\nIN PUBLIC TALKING ABOUT THIS. HE'S DONE THINGS UNEXPECTED\nBEFORE, RIGHT? HE IS VERY UNPREDICTABLE.\nTO MAEVE'S POINT, IT'S SO HARD TO DO THAT.\nIT'S ALSO A MATTER OF WE'RE IN A DIFFERENT TIME, RIGHT?\nBILL CLINTON HE WAS IMPEACHED. HE WAS HIGHLY SCRUTINIZED.\nHE PAID SOMETHING OF A PRICE FOR THAT AND TO BRING THAT UP NOW,\nIT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY BLAME FROM DONALD TRUMP.\n>> THINK ABOUT ALL OF THOSE REACTION SHOTS IN THE TOWN HALL\nTONIGHT. THIS IS NOT A WARM DONALD TRUMP\nCROWD. THESE ARE UNDECIDED VOTERS WHO\nARE COMING THERE TO POSE QUESTIONS TO CANDIDATES.\nAND THE PEOPLE AT HOME, YOU KNOW, IF HE WERE TO GO ON THAT\nKIND OF AN ATTACK ARE GOING TO BE WATCHING THOSE PEOPLE IN THE\nAUDIENCE AND WHAT THEY'RE FEELING, HOW UNCOMFORTABLE\nTHEY'RE FEELING. I DON'T THINK THAT THAT CAN BE\nDISCOUNTED IN TERMS OF HOW THAT AFFECTS HIS PERFORMANCE.\n>> I DON'T THINK -- I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD ASSUME THAT HE\nWON'T DO IT. >> RIGHT.\n>> BUT I THINK THAT WE SHOULD ASSUME THAT IF HE DOES IT COULD\nCOST HIM MORE SUPPORT AMONG THE REPUBLICAN RANK AND FILE AS WELL\nAS THE RANK -- THE LEADERSHIP. IT'S A VERY DANGEROUS THING FOR\nHIM TO DO THIS. I KNOW THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO\nDO THIS. THEY CLEARLY WANT TO GO IN THAT\nD DIRECTION.\nTHEY WANT TO TURN THIS AGAINST HER.\nNOT JUST AGAINST BILL BUT HILLARY CLINTON, AN ENABLER OF\nBILL CLINTON'S BEHAVIOR. IT'S SO DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO DO\nTHAT. I DO THINK -- WE HAVE THIS\nNOTION THAT THE TOWN HALL DEBATES ARE CONSTRICTING.\nI HAVE A FEELING THAT THIS WILL BE LESS CONSTRICTING IN PART\nBECAUSE I THINK BOTH ANDERSON COOPER AND MARTHA RADDATZ WHO\nWILL BE MODERATING, THEY WILL BE PLAYERS AS WELL AS THE PEOPLE\nASKING QUESTIONS FROM THE AUDIENCE.\n>> HE IS SUCH LIMITED POLITICAL PERFORMER.\nHE IS THIS CONSUMMATE SHOWMAN, BUT THIS IS NOT AN ENVIRONMENT\nUNLESS THE RULES HAVE CHANGED WHERE YOU CAN REMOVE DISSENTERS\nFROM THE CROWD. THERE WAS A FEELING TALKING TO\nTHE REPUBLICANS OVER THE PAST COUPLE DAYS THAT IF HE REALLY\nAPPEARED ON BENDED KNEE AND REALLY EXPRESSED DEEP CONTRITION\nABOUT THIS AND HAD A DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS STUFF, THAT ISN'T WHO\nDONALD TRUMP IS. HE CANNOT REBRAND HIMSELF ON THE\nSTAGE TONIGHT. PEOPLE WON'T LET HIM DO THAT.\n>> I THINK THERE'S ANOTHER ASPECT TO THIS, THAT IS WHAT\nHAPPENED IN THE FIRST DEBATE. HER ABILITY TO GET UNDER HIS\nSKIN TIME AND TIME AND TIME AGAIN, THERE'S NO REASON TO\nEXPECT SHE'S NOT GOING TO TRY TO DO THAT SAME THING TONIGHT AND\nHOW WILL HE BE ABLE TO CONTROL HIMSELF TO BE MORE DISCIPLINED\nTHAN HE WAS THE FIRST TIME. THERE'S SO MUCH IN HIS HEAD AT\nTHIS POINT. >> THAT'S WHAT HIS ADVISERS HAVE\nBEEN TRYING TO DO IS TO -- TO THE EXTENT THEY CAN GET HIM TO\nPREP FOR DEBATES IS TO TRY TO GET HIM TO RESOLVE NOT TO GO\nDOWN THOSE RABBIT HOLES SHE LED HIM DOWN SO SUCCESSFULLY DURING\nTHE LAST DEBATE. >> WHEN YOU ASK PENCE ABOUT\nSOMETHING, JUST PIVOT TO E-MAILS, PIVOT TO CLINTON\nFOUNDATIONS. THE INTERESTING THING ALSO IS\nTHAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS NOT SAID ANYTHING PUBLICLY ABOUT\nTHIS. ALL SHE HAS DONE -- SHE DID DO A\nTWEET FRIDAY AFTERNOON AFTER THE TAPE BROKE, THIS IS HORRIFIC.\nWE CANNOT ALLOW THIS MAN TO BE PRESIDENT.\nTHEY SAW THAT REPUBLICANS WERE FLAILING THEIR OWN NOMINEE.\n>> THEY ALSO KIND OF CAUTIONED DEMOCRATS NOT TO GET OUT THERE\nTOO FAR TO LET HER HAVE HER FIRST FULSOME STATEMENT ON THIS\nTONIGHT ON THIS STAGE. AND IN SOME WAYS THAT IS WHAT\nTHEY'VE DONE ALL ALONG. THINK ABOUT AUGUST, THEY KIND OF\nJUST LET DONALD TRUMP BE OUT THERE AND HANG HIMSELF.\nEVEN IN THAT FIRST DEBATE BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM, SHE\nHUNG BACK. SHE WAS ALMOST OPERATING ABOUT\n30% AND LETTING HIM JUST TALK AND TALK AND TALK.\n>> ANOTHER QUICK POINT AND WE'LL TALK MORE AS WE GO THROUGH THE\nREST OF THE HOUR, TALK ABOUT THE METRICS OF CAMPAIGN AND THE NUTS\nAND BOLTS OF CAMPAIGN, 30 DAYS, THE ELECTION IS 30 DAYS FROM\nTODAY. DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN PROMISED\nWELL BEFORE ALL THIS HAPPENED THEY WERE GOING TO SPEND $100\nMILLION ON TELEVISION IN THE FINAL DAYS OF CAMPAIGN.\nTHEY ONLY RESERVED 45 MILLION. THEY PULLED BACK IN SOME\nMARKETS. THERE IS NOT A CHANCE DONALD\nTRUMP WILL BE ABLE TO RAISE THE MONEY TO BE COMPETITIVE ON\nTELEVISION UNLESS HE FINDS A WAY TO PUT THIS BEHIND HIM.\nYOU MENTIONED BENDED KNEE. I WAS E-MAILING WITH A BUNCH OF\nPEOPLE YESTERDAY. UNLESS THEY'RE WILLING TO PUT UP\nA LOT MORE MONEY, DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN WAS ALREADY IN TROUBLE\nWITH FUNDRAISING. I CAN ASSUME THIS IS GOING TO BE\nA BIG PROBLEM. >> SHE RAISED 150 -- ROUGHLY\n$150 MILLION IN THE MONTH OF AUGUST.\nIT WAS A HIGH RISK STRATEGY. SHE REALLY LET HIM BACK INTO THE\nGAME BY GOING DARK FOR MOST OF THE MONTH OF AUGUST.\nBUT FOR EXAMPLE I WAS IN COLORADO OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF\nDAYS AND I HAD CNN ON LOOP AS I ALWAYS DO.\n>> BLESS YOU CHILD. >> AND I SAW A FEW HILLARY\nCLINTON ADS AND FEW GENERIC GOP ADS.\nDID NOT SEE A SINGLE DONALD TRUMP AD.\n>> DONALD TRUMP SAYS THE COMMENTS CAUGHT ON TAPE ARE ON\nABERRATION, NOT WHO HE IS. WE GO THROUGH THE TAPE LIBRARY\nAND YOU MAKE THE CALL NEXT.",

THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF WOMEN,\nTHE ROMNEY REPUBLICAN WOMEN THAT IN STATES LIKE NORTH CAROLINA,\nTHAT HILLARY CLINTON THINKS SHE HAS AN IN ROADS AND THIS JUST\nMAKES HER CASE EVEN STRONGER. >> I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THAT\nTHERE ARE A LOT OF TRUMP SUPPORT WHO ARE WILL NOT BE MOVED AWAY\nFROM HIM BECAUSE OF THIS AND WE'VE SEEN IT TIME AND TIME\nAGAIN. HOW MUCH TIMES HAVE WE\nOVERSTATED THE IMPACT OF SOMETHING HE'S SAID OR DONE AND\nTURNED OUT NOT TO BE SIGNIFICANT IN TERMS OF HIS LEVEL OF\nSUPPORT. THIS IS NOT A SITUATION FOR HIM\nIN WHICH HE SIMPLY HAS TO HOLD WHAT HE'S GOT.\nHE HAS TO MAKE UP GROUND THAT THEY'VE BEEN LOSING OVER THE\nLAST SEVERAL WEEKS. AND THAT UNDER THESE\nCIRCUMSTANCES BECOMES ENORMOUSLY DIFFICULT.\n>> DEFENSE VERY HARD TO GAIN ON DEFENSE.\nJUST BEFORE YOU JUMP IN, I WANT TO SHOW THIS FROM OUR LATEST\nPOLL, TRUMP ALREADY HAD A GENDER GAP.\nHE DOES VERY WELL WITH MEN. LOOK HERE.\nCLINTON 53, TRUMP 40. GARY JOHNSON AND JILL STINE\nGETTING 4% COMBINED AT THE BOTTOM.\nIT'S SAFE TO ASSUME IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF THESE\nTAPES THAT THAT'S NOT GOING TO GET WORSE AND MANY THINK IT FOR\nHER GET BETTER. >> FOR ALL THE TALK ABOUT HOW\nUNPREDICTABLE AND DYNAMIC THE RACE IS, DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN\nSTUCK IN JUST ABOUT THE MOST NARROW RANGE OF ANY MODERN\nCANDIDATE. HE IS BETWEEN 38 AND 43%.\nHE DOESN'T REALLY GET BEYOND THAT.\nAND WHAT HE NEEDED TO DO, EVEN DURING HIS BEST MOMENT, HIS\nSALAD DAYS OF AUGUST, RIGHT, THE GUY DID NOT PUSH MUCH PAST 42 OR\n43%.

THE STAKES COULD NOT BE ANY\nHIGHER. LET'S ASK OUR GREAT REPORTERS TO\nGIVE YOU A SNEAK PEEK INTO THEIR NOTEBOOKS.\n>> CLINTON TALKED ABOUT THIS EARLIER, DONALD TRUMP'S BEEN\nMOVING IN A PARTICULAR BAND IN TERMS OF THE POLLING, SO IS\nHILLARY CLINTON. HER BAND IS A LITTLE HIGHER.\nAS THE NEWS MOVES, THOSE BANDS MOVE, SO GOOD WEEK FOR DONALD\nTRUMP. IF IT'S A BAD WEEK FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON, SHE GOES DOWN AND VICE VERSA.\nPEOPLE PARTICULARLY DEMOCRATS WONDER WHETHER THIS MOMENT THIS\nTAPE WILL FINALLY BREAK THAT CYCLE THAT SHE WILL BE ABLE TO\nPUSH BEYOND THE MARGIN SHE HAS BEEN ABLE TO TOP OUT AT HAS\nGENERALLY BEEN IN THE FOUR TO FIVE-POINT RANGE AND GO HIGHER.\nTHAT'S THE THING THAT EVERYBODY WILL BE WATCHING OVER THE NEXT\nCOUPLE WEEKS. >> I AM DIEING TO SEE A POST\nTAPEGATE POLL OF OHIO. OHIO HAS BEEN REALLY THE BULL\nWORK OF TRUMP'S MIDWESTERN STRATEGY WHERE OBVIOUSLY WE'VE\nSEEN SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT DEFECTIONS ON THE PART OF WOMEN\nAS A RESULT OF THIS TAPE. HILLARY HAD SURGED AHEAD BY ONE\nOR TWO POINTS IN SOME RECENT POLLING.\nI WOULD LOVE TO SEE IF HER IMPROVEMENT IN THAT STATE IS\nACCELERATING BECAUSE IF IT IS, IT'S LIGHTS OUT.\n>> OHIO WOULD BE GAME OVER. STAY TUNED.\nCNN IS ABOUT TO GO TO THE FIELD IN OHIO.\nI'M NOT SURE IF I'M SUPPOSED TO TELL ANYBODY OUT THERE.\nMAEVE? >> NEVADA.\nWE SAW A BRIEF CLIP OF THIS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SHOW, BUT\nDR. JOE HECK IN A VERY TIGHT SENATE RACE OUT THERE GOT\nINTO -- WENT OUT ON STAGE YESTERDAY AND DENOUNCED DONALD\nTRUMP AND GOT BOOED OVER AND OVER AGAIN.\nNOW, OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO CAME OUT AGAINST TRUMP AFTER THIS\nTAPE, I THINK THAT FOR HECK THIS WAS MAYBE ONE OF THE BIGGEST\nGAMBLES BECAUSE NEVADA IS A STATE THAT HAS BEEN VERY KIND TO\nDONALD TRUMP. IT'S VERY CLOSE THERE.\nIT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO POLL. AND IT WILL BE REALLY\nFASCINATING TO SEE WITH HILLARY CLINTON HEADED OUT THERE THIS\nWEEK WHETHER OR NOT HE CAN HANG ON IN THAT CLOSE RACE.\n>> FASCINATING. COULD MAKE THE DIFFERENCE TOO.\nTHAT COULD BE THE DIFFERENCE AS WE MOVE WEST THROUGH THE UP AND\nDOWN SENATE RACES. NEVADA COULD DO IT.\n>> TWO BIG PROGRESSIVE GROUPS LAUNCHING THEIR BIGGEST GET OUT\nTHE VOTE EFFORTS IN THEIR HISTORY.\nPLANNED PARENTHOOD AS WELL AS THE HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN WHICH\nIS AN LGBTQ. TARGETING MILLENNIAL VOTERS AND\nIN TERMS OF HRC, THEY ARE VERY MUCH TARGETING SWING STATES AS\nWELL. NORTH CAROLINA THEY WANT TO DO\n400,000 VOTER CONTACTS IN THAT STATE WHICH IS GOING TO BE NECK\nAND NECK DOWN TO THE WIRE. AND THIS GOES TO SHOW OF THE\nORGANIZATIONAL STRENGTH, I THINK, OF THE LEFT COMPARED TO\nTHE RIGHT, WHICH IS VERY MUCH KIND OF IN SHAMBLES AT THIS\nPOINT IN TERMS OF FIGURING OUT HOW TO SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP.\n>> FINAL 30 DAYS THE NUTS AND BOLTS MATTER MOST.\nI'LL CLOSE FROM MY CONVERSATIONS YESTERDAY, DONALD TRUMP WAS\nQUITE EMPHATIC, HE WILL NEVER QUIT.\nWE EXPECT TO HEAR THAT TONIGHT. THERE ARE THOSE CLOSE TO HIM WHO\nSEE THAT STATEMENT TORN FROM THE PAGES OF ART OF THE DEAL.\nVERY DIFFERENT PEOPLE, TRUMP CAMPAIGN AID DLES E KNOWN HIM\nONLY FOR THE PAST YEAR AND FRIEND WHOSE KNOWN HIM FOR\nDECADES SENT ME THE SAME OBSERVATION IF TONIGHT GOES\nBADLY AND THE POLLS KEEP GOING CLINTON'S DIRECTION THAT THE\nNEVER GET OUT WILL BECOME THE STARTING POINT IN A NEGOTIATION.\nNOW BOTH NOTED TRUMP SAID LONG AGO IF THE POLLS TANKED HE WOULD\nCONSIDER QUITTING, BUT THIS CLOSE TO ELECTION DAY, BOTH\nAGREE THAT'S UNLIKELY BUT BOTH ALSO SAID THEY COULD SEE TRUMP\nNEGOTIATING HIS EXIT IN EXCHANGE FOR A REPUBLICAN PARTY PAY BACK\nOF ALL THE PERSONAL FUNDS HE'S POURED INTO HIS CAMPAIGN.\nNOW AGAIN, THEY SAID THEY THOUGHT IT WAS UNLIKELY.\nI'M GOING TO TELL YOU I THINK IT WAS UNLIKELY BUT IT WAS\nFASCINATING TO ME THAT TWO PEOPLE CLOSE TO TRUMP IN HIS\nCAMP WOULD SUGGEST SUCH A THING. WE'LL KEEP AN EYE ON IT.\nTHANKS FOR SHARING YOUR SUNDAY MORNING.\nREMEMBER, INSIDE POLITICS ALSO LIVE EVERY WEEKDAY 12:00 P.M.\nTHROUGH ELECTION WEEK. WE HOPE YOU BACK WITH US AT 4:00\nP.M. UP NEXT, \"STATE OF THE UNION\"\nWITH JAKE TAPPER.",

YESTERDAY CONDOLEEZZA RICE AND\nJOHN McCAIN ADDED THEIR NAMES TO THE ANTI-TRUMP LIST.\nAND DONALD TRUMP SAID THERE IS ZERO CHANCE I WILL QUIT,\nUNQUOTE. AND HOW MUCH OF A GAME-CHANGER\nIS THIS 11-YEAR-OLD TAPE. JOINING ME IS JON MEACHAM, AND\nTHE HISTORIAN AND THE AUTHOR OF THE GEORGE H.W. BUSH BIOGRAPHY\nDESTINY AND POWER. KATHLEEN HALL JAMIESON, DIRECTOR\nOF THE PUBLIC POLICY CENTER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA\nAND JAMES FALLOWS THE CHIEF SPEECH WRITER TO PRESIDENT JIMMY\nCARTER AND NOW NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT FOR THE ATLANTIC.\nJON, LET ME START WITH YOU, CAN YOU RECALL AT ANY POINT IN\nHISTORY WHERE SOMETHING THIS STARTLING HAS HAPPENED WITH JUST\nONE MONTH TO GO. >> WELL, THINGS -- OCTOBER\nSURPRISES COME ALMOST EVERY YEAR.\n1972, DR. KISSINGER CAME OUT AND SAID PEACE WAS AT HAND.\nTHE FACT THAT WE'VE GONE FROM ISSUES OF WAR AND PEACE AS AN\nOCTOBER SURPRISE TO \"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD\" MAY DISPROVE DARWIN\nWHICH WE COULD TALK ABOUT, EVEN IN RECENT HISTORY, YOU HAVE\nGEORGE W. BUSH DUI ARREST WHICH CAME FOUR DAYS BEFORE THE\nELECTION IN WHICH HE HIMSELF IS CONVINCED COST HIM THE POPULAR\nVOTE IN SOME QUARTERS. AND IN 2004, OSAMA BIN LADEN\nISSUED A VIDEO TAPE THAT SENATOR KERRY ALSO BELIEVES HURT HIM\nSIGNIFICANTLY. TO ME, WHAT THE TRUMP STORY\nDOES, IN TERMS OF POLITICAL NARRATIVE AND IN TERMS OF LIFE,\nWHEN YOU HEAR SOMETHING, IT EITHER CHANGES YOUR VIEW OR\nAFFIRMS YOUR VIEW. SORT OF LIKE THE OLD SAYING THAT\nALL STORIES ARE ABOUT A MAN GOES ON A TRIP -- GOES ON A JOURNEY\nOR A STRANGER COMES TO TOWN. SO DOES THIS CHANGE OR AFFIRM.\nIT SEEMS TO ME THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLY AFFIRMING\nDEVELOPMENTS THAT ONE COULD HAVE IN TERMS OF THE POPULAR\nIMPRESSION OF TRUMP. >> JIM, TO THAT POINT, WHAT\nSTRIKES ME ABOUT THIS IS DIDN'T WE KNOW THIS ALREADY?\nTHE MANY, MANY REFERENCES IN THE HOWARD STERN AUDIO TAPES,\nTESTIMONY FROM OTHER PEOPLE, THE CONTROVERSY AROUND MISS\nAMERICA -- MISS UNIVERSE, AND ALL OF IT IS PART OF THE SAME\nPATTERN WHICH BASICALLY IS THAT TRUMP OBJECT FIED WOMEN, VERY\nCLEARLY AND DISTINCTLY AND ESSENTIALLY SEEING THEM AS\nOBJECTS OF INTEREST FOR MEN. WHY DO YOU THINK THIS REVELATION\nHAS BEEN SO MUCH MORE DRAMATIC? IS THIS JUST THE STRAW THAT\nBROKE THE CAMEL'S BACK? >> I THINK IT IS PARTLY WHAT JON\nSAID. THE FACT OF HEARING AND SEEING\nIT IN REALTIME AND SEEING THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE TALK INSIDE\nOF THE BUS AND THEN THIS GENTLEMANLY DEMEANOR WHEN HE\nGETS OFF THE BUS AND STARTS TALKING TO THE YOUNG ACTRESS,\nTHAT HAS A YOUNG VIVIDNESS. OVER THE LAST YEAR, MANY OF US\nIN DISCUSSIONS LIKE THIS AROUND THE COUNTRY WONDER WHY THINGS\nTHAT WOULD HAVE STOPPED ANY PREVIOUS CANDIDATE HAD NOT\nSTOPPED DONALD TRUMP. AND THIS STARTED I THINK WHEN HE\nWAS MAKING FUN OF JOHN McCAIN AS A LOSER FOR HAVING BEEN CAPTURED\nDURING THE VIETNAM WAR AND THEN MOCKING A DISABLED REPORTER AND\nON DOWN THE LONG LIST. SO I THINK WE HAD SORT OF\nDEVELOPED A SENSE OF ANYTHING WAS GOING TO BE POSSIBLE FOR THE\nPEOPLE WHO WERE REALLY FOR TRUMP AND FOR REASONS THAT I'M SURE\nWILL LOOK BACK WHEN CONSIDERING THIS ELECTION, SUDDENLY THIS WAS\nTHE THING. IT WASN'T THE MEXICAN JUDGE OR\nBUILD THE WALL OR NO TAXES, IT WASN'T THE THOUSAND OTHER\nTHINGS, INCLUDING THE HOWARD STERN TAPES THAT REALLY PUSHED\nPEOPLE OVER. SOMEHOW THIS DID IT.\nAND ON THE HISTORICAL COMPARISONS, TOO, THE ONLY THING\nTHE SPECTACLE OF THE LAST 24 HOURS MAKES ME THINK OF IS THE\nLAST WEEK OR SO BEFORE RICHARD NIXON STEPS DOWN WHEN\nREPUBLICANS BEGAN STEPPING AWAY FROM HIM.\nIF THIS WERE A NORMAL CAMPAIGN, NOBODY HAS COME BACK FROM AS FAR\nBEHIND AS TRUMP IS NOW. THIS IS NOT A NORMAL CAMPAIGN.\nAND TO HAVE HIS OWN PARTY BAILING OUT, I THINK THE NIXON\nFUNNEL DAYS ARE THE ONLY COMPARISON THAT COME TO MY MIND.\n>> KATHLEEN, WHAT IS IT THAT CHANGES PEOPLE'S MINDS?\nYOU'VE LOOKED AT SO MANY POLLS. I'M STRUCK BY -- WE SHOULD TAKE\nTHIS FOR WHAT IT IS. THERE IS ONE POLL OUT SINCE THE\nVIDEO REVELATIONS AND HE HASN'T DROPPED MUCH, HE IS FOUR POINTS\nBEHIND. THIS IS ONE POLL AND IT IS NOT\nCLEAR THAT IT WAS POLLED AFTER ALL OF THE REVELATIONS.\nBUT WHAT IS YOUR SENSE OF WHAT CHANGES PEOPLE'S MINDS.\n>> NEW EVIDENCE COULD CHANGE PEOPLE'S MINDS.\nWHAT WE ARE MISSING IN THIS DISCUSSION WHEN DONALD TRUMP\nDEFENDED HE SAID THAT THESE WORDS DON'T REFLECT WHO I AM.\nTHE STATEMENT ON THE BUS IS NOT SIMPLY ABOUT HIS WORDS.\nTHESE ARE STATEMENTS ABOUT THINGS HE REPORTS HAVING DONE.\nAND THE TAPES THAT CAME OUT THIS WEEKEND FROM HOWARD STERN SHOW\nALSO PUT INTO WORDS THINGS THAT HE SAYS HE HAS DONE.\nWALKING INTO DRESSING ROOMS OF CONTESTANTS BEFORE THE MISS\nUNIVERSE PAGEANT, FOR EXAMPLE. SO TO THE EXCEPT THAT PEOPLE UP\nTO THIS POINT HAVE HEARD THESE WORDS THAT HAVE BEEN\nPROBLEMATIC, RE-AIRED CONSTANTLY IN HILLARY CLINTON ADS AND\nTHEY'VE CHARACTERIZED THIS AS LANGUAGE AND THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN\nSAID DISTANT PAST OR I WAS AN ENTERTAINER AND DIFFERENT PERSON\nAND THIS IS NOT WORDS ABOUT WHAT HE SAID HE HAS DONE.\nTHAT POTENTIAL NEW EVIDENCE IS HIGHLY CONSEQUENTIAL BECAUSE OF\nTHE WAY IT IS FRAMED IN MEDIA. LOOK AT THE WORDS USED BY\nREPUBLICANS. SEXUAL ASSAULT, THOSE ARE\nDESCRIPTIONS OF WHAT HE SAID HE HAD DONE, LIKE PREDATOR AND\nPREDATORY WERE BEING USED. THAT IS NEW EVIDENCE.\nNEW EVIDENCE COULD CHANGE FRAMES.\nNEW FRAMES COULD CHANGE ATTITUDES.\n>> STAY RIGHT THERE. WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'LL DIG\nDEEPER INTO TONIGHT'S DEBATE AND WHAT HISTORY SHOULD TEACH TRUMP\nAND CLINTON ABOUT WHAT TO DO AND NOT TO DO ON STAGE TONIGHT.\nDON'T FORGET IT IS AT 9:00 P.M. EASTERN ON CNN.\nWE WILL BE BACK.   NOW THAT FEDEX HAS HELPED US\n    SIMPLIFY OUR E-COMMERCE, WE COULD FOCUS ON BIGGER ISSUES,   LIKE OUR PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE\n          ENVIRONMENT.  WE'RE NOT PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE.          HEY, HEY, HEY,",

JIM, I WANTED TO ASK YOU, WHEN\nYOU CHIEF SPEECH WRITER TO JIMMY CARTER, YOU DESCRIBED THAT AS\nBEING FDR'S TAP DANCE INSTRUCTOR.\nHE WAS NOT A MAN WHO ENJOYED OR TOOK MUCH DIRECTION IN TERMS OF\nPUBLIC SPEAKING. DONALD TRUMP FACES A HUGE\nCHALLENGE NOW TONIGHT. AND HE'S NOT A MAN WHO TAKES\nMUCH INSTRUCTION. SO WATCHING THE DEBATES, AND I\nKNOW YOU WATCHED THEM VERY CAREFULLY OF THE TERRIFIC COVER\nSTORY IN THE ATLANTIC, WATCHING THE DEBATES, WHAT ARE TRUMP'S\nWEAKNESS, WATCHING THE PRIMARY AND THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL\nDEBATE? >> HIS MAIN WEAKNESS IS THAT\nTHERE IS A STYLE HE HAS, WHICH WORKS VERY WELL IN SOME\nCIRCUMSTANCES AND QUITE POORLY IN OTHERS.\nHIS STYLE IS ESSENTIALLY DOMINATION, BOMB BAST AND\nSIMPLICITY OF MESSAGE WHICH DURING THE PRIMARY WORKED FINE\nBECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE ON STAGE AND COMPETING\nFOR AIR TIME AND TRUMP COULD STEP IN WHENEVER HE WANTED AS IF\nIT WERE A REALITY SHOW AND A WRESTLING MATCH AND MAKE FUN OF\nTHE OTHER PEOPLE, LITTLE MARCO OR WHATEVER ELSE.\nTHAT WORKED VERY WELL IN THE PRIMARY CAMPAIGN.\nIT IS NOT AS GOOD IN NORMAL GENERAL ELECTION DEBATES BECAUSE\nTHERE IS ONLY TWO PEOPLE ON STAGE.\nIT IS MUCH HARDER TO GET AWAY WITH BEING DOMINEERING AGAINST A\nFEMALE OPPONENT WHO -- AND ALSO TRUMP HAS A HISTORY OF SHRINKING\nFROM FEMALE OPPONENTS IN LIVE EXCHANGES AND HE DOESN'T KNOW\nENOUGH SUBSTANCE. BUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN TONIGHT IS\nUNPRECEDENTED IN ALL PUBLIC RHETORICAL EXPERIENCE BECAUSE\nNOBODY HAS EVER COME TO A DEBATE WITH THIS PRECEDING 48 HOURS OF\nNEWS AS DONALD TRUMP HAS. SO I'LL JUST SAY ONE OWN THING,\nTHE MAIN COMPARISON WAS BILL CLINTON, AFTER HIS IMPEACHMENT,\nHAD TO GIVE \"STATE OF THE UNION\" SPEECHES AND HAD TO RECOVER\nHIMSELF AND CLINTON WAS A GIFTED PERFORMER AND TRUMP SEEMS TO\nHAVE THIS ONE SPEED. SO WE'LL SEE HOW HE APPLIES THAT\nONE SPEED TONIGHT. AND I THINK THAT IS WHY IT MAY\nBE THE LARGEST AUDIENCE EVER FOR A DEBATE.\n>> JON, THE FORMAT IS OF COURSE A TOWN HALL AND TRUMP HASN'T\nDONE THESE SO MUCH. THERE IS A -- A PART OF WHAT\nYOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS CONNECT AND HAVE EMPATHY AND\nTHERE WAS THIS MOMENT IN THE BUSH-CLINTON-ROSS PERROT DEBATE\nWHERE PRESIDENT BUSH REALLY FUMBLED AND CLINTON WAS ABLE TO\nCONNECT. WHAT WENT WRONG AND WHAT WENT\nRIGHT FOR BUSH AND CLINTON? >> THAT'S WITH IN RICHMOND IN\n1992. AND PRESIDENT BUSH HAD NOT DONE\nOF THESE. PRESIDENTS ALWAYS, AS JIM AND\nKATHLEEN KNOW, DEBATES FOR INCUMBENTS ARE ALWAYS TRICKY\nTHINGS BECAUSE NO ONE HAS SPOKEN TO THEM THIS WAY SINCE THEY TOOK\nTHE OATH. NO ONE HAS REALLY QUESTIONED\nTHEM VERY MUCH. BUT WHAT HAPPENED IN RICHMOND\nWAS A QUESTION OR ASKED OF THE PRESIDENT ABOUT HOW THE NATIONAL\nDEBT HAD PERSONALLY AFFECTED HIM.\nPRESIDENT BUSH TOOK THAT LITERALLY MEANING THE NATIONAL\nDEBT AS OPPOSED TO THE ECONOMIC RECESSION AND SAID, AS HE WAS\nTRYING TO ANSWER IT, MAYBE I JUST DON'T GET IT.\nAND CLINTON AIDES ARE REPORTED TO HAVE STARTED HIGH FIVING EACH\nOTHER IN THE CONTROL ROOM BECAUSE THEY REALIZED THAT AT\nTHAT MOMENT WHERE BUSH HAD INADVERTENTLY CRYSTALIZED WHAT\nWAS THE POPULAR NARRATIVE. AND IF YOU WATCH THE TAPE,\nYOU'LL SEE BILL CLINTON WITH ALMOST A WOLFISH LOOK ON HIS\nFACE AND SITTING AND WAITING TO COME IN AND HAVE A KIND OF OPRAH\nMOMENT. PRESIDENT BUSH SITS DOWN AND\nCLINTON COMES IN AND SAYS I BET YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN\nAFFECTED IN MY STATE, IF SOMEONE LOSES THEIR JOB, THERE IS A GOOD\nCHANCE I KNOW THEM. AND IN THIS WAY, THE 20th\nCENTURY ENDED THAT NIGHT BECAUSE YOU HAD A WORLD WAR II FIGURE, A\nMAN WHO DID IN FACT -- GEORGE H.W. BUSH IS A EMOTIONALLY\nTACTILE MAN HE JUST HAS A HARD TIME IN PUBLIC SHOWING THAT.\nBILL CLINTON UNDERSTOOD THAT OUR CURRENT GENERATION NEEDED THAT\nKIND OF CONFESSIONAL POLITICS. >> FASCINATING.\nWE'RE GOING TO STICK WITH ALL OF THIS AND COME BACK.\nAND WHEN WE COME BACK, I WANT TO START WITH KATHLEEN HALL\nJAMIESON AND JON MEACHAM AND JAMES FALLOWS AND WHAT SHOULD\nHILLARY CLINTON DO IF TRUMP BRINGS UP BILL CLINTON'S PAST.\nSTAY WITH US.",

              "text": "JAMIESON AND JAMES FALLOWS.\nKATHLEEN, BEFORE WE GET TO BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON, I WANT TO\nASK YOU ABOUT TRUMP AGAIN. BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT\nSTRUCK MANY PEOPLE WAS THAT DURING THE PRIMARY DEBATES, THE\nONE PERSON TRUMP WAS NOT ABLE TO DEBATE EFFECTIVELY WAS CARLY\nFIORINA. THERE WAS A MOMENT WHERE HE\nINSULTS HER AND HE HAD PREVIOUSLY INSULTED HER BECAUSE\nOF HER LOOKS AND SHE STANDS UP AND SAID THIS IS WHAT\nSOMEBODY -- A WOMAN OF THIS AGE LOOKS LIKE.\nDEAL WITH IT. AND HE REALLY CAN'T DEAL WITH\nIT. AND TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, IN THE\nFIRST DEBATE THERE SEEMED TO BE THAT SAME PROBLEM.\nJAMES WAS ALLUDING TO HIS STYLE IS DOMINATION AND IT LOOKS BAD\nAND NOW HE HAS REVELATIONS, AS I SAY, OF REALLY POWERFULLY\nCONFIRMING THE DEGREE TO WHICH HE OBJECTIFIED WOMEN IN THEIR\nSEX ROLES. HOW DIFFICULT OR HOW BIG OF A\nBURDEN IS IT, JUST THAT GENDER DYNAMIC FOR HIM IN YOUR VIEW?\n>> THE THING THAT CARLY FIORINA SAID THAT WAS MOST EFFECTIVE WAS\nTHE WOMEN OF AMERICA KNOW WHAT THEY HEARD DONALD TRUMP SAY, IN\nESSENCE LETTING WOMEN BRING THEIR LIVES EXPERIENCE OF THE\nINTERACTION BETWEEN TRUMP AND CARLY FIORINA, ABOUT CARLY\nFIORINA'S APPEARANCE. AND THAT IS WHAT WILL PLAY\nTONIGHT. AND TO THE EXTENT HE INTERRUPTS\nAS HE DID IN THE FIRST DEBATE, IT IS INTERPRETED THROUGH A\nDIFFERENT SET OF UNDERSTANDING IN LIGHT OF THE MOST RECENT\nCONTROVERSIES. >> FASCINATING.\nOKAY. SO JIM, YOU ARE DOING DEBATE\nPREP WITH HILLARY CLINTON AND THEY SAY TRUMP HAS NOW SIGNALS\nTHREE OR FOUR TIMES THAT HE INTENDS TO BRING UP BILL\nCLINTON'S INFIDELITIES AND HILLARY'S ROLE IN COVERING THEM\nUP. IF HE DOES, WHAT SHOULD HILLARY\nCLINTON DO? >> SO I THINK THE DYNAMICS HAVE\nCHANGED IN THE PAST 48 HOURS AND I THINK SHE HAS A STRATEGIC GOAL\nAND A TACTIC ONE. THE STRATEGIC GOAL FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON IS TO SHOW PEOPLE THAT SHE IS THE ADULT IN CHARGE.\nSHE IS THE ONE WHO IS RESPONSIBLE.\nSHE IS THE ONE THAT THEY COULD FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH IN\nCONTRAST TO WHAT THEY'VE LEARNED ABOUT DONALD TRUMP IN THE LAST\nCOUPLE OF DAYS OR HAVE CONFIRMED AND SHE NEEDS TO BE ABOVE THE\nFRAY AND TACTICALLY, IF HE BRINGS UP BILK, SHE COULD SAY WE\nARE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING INVOLVING MY HUSBAND 20-PLUS\nYEARS AGO THAT THE ENTIRE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES\nLITIGATED AND WAS TIED UP IN OVER YEARS AND PEOPLE COULD MAKE\nTHEIR OWN DECISIONS ABOUT IT, WE ARE HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE\nFUTURE OF THE ECONOMY. THE MORE ECONOMICALLY SHE COULD\nADDRESS IT AND SAY IT IS IN THE PAST AND HER HUSBAND THAT SHE'S\nBEEN MARRIED TO ALL OF THESE YEARS AND IT IS SORT OF TRIED IN\nTHE COURT OF BOTH THE CONGRESS AND PUBLIC OPINION AND SAY THE\nREAL POINT FOR AMERICA IS X, Y AND Z.\nTHAT IS MY GUESS. >> JON, IT DOES SOUND LIKE FROM\nWHAT JIM IS SAYING, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS STYLE RATHER\nTHAN SUBSTANCE. COME ACROSS AS PRESIDENTIAL.\nI REMEMBER THAT MOMENT IN THE REAGAN-CARTER DEBATES, WHEN\nCARTER BROUGHT UP A FACTUALLY CORRECT POINT WHICH WAS THAT\nREAGAN HAD BEEN AGAINST SOCIAL SECURITY AND WANTS TO CUT IT AND\nREAGAN JUST SAID THERE HE GOES AGAIN.\nAND THAT CHARMING SORT OF DEMEANOR TRUMPED THE SUBSTANCE\nOF WHAT CARTER WAS SAYING WHICH TODAY NOBODY EVEN REMEMBERS.\n>> RIGHT. AND I THINK STYLE AND SUBSTANCE\nWE SOMETIMES TREAT AS TWO SEPARATE DICHOTOMY, WHEN THERE\nIS A CONNECTION, WHAT HILLARY CLINTON NEEDS TO DO IS PRESENT\nHERSELF AS TEMPERAMENTALLY AND INTELLECTUALLY FIT FOR THE\nPRESIDENCY. SHE IS IN FACT FIT FOR THE\nPRESIDENCY AND THERE ARE REAL CONCERNS THAT DONALD TRUMP IS\nNOT. AND SO IN THAT SENSE, STYLE AND\nSUBSTANCE ARE CONNECTED. IF I WERE TALKING TO SECRETARY\nCLINTON RIGHT NOW, I WOULD SIMPLY CITE THE NAPOLIAN ADAGE,\nNEVER GET IN THE WAY OF A OPPONENT DESTROYING THEMSELVES.\nI WOULD COME OFFER AND DEFER THE BALANCE OF MY TIME AND LET HIM\nKEEP TALKING. BECAUSE THE MORE HE TALKS, THE\nFURTHER THE -- THE DEEPER THE HOLE GETS.\n>> LET ME ASK YOU VERY QUICKLY, KATHLEEN, IF YOU HAD SOME ADVICE\nFOR HILLARY CLINTON OR DONALD TRUMP, WHAT IS THE GOAL HERE FOR\nTHIS -- FOR TONIGHT'S DEBATE? >> DONALD TRUMP, SHOW YOU'RE\nKNOWLEDGEABLE AND COMMAND THE DETAIL NECESSARY TO BE THE\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND DEMONSTRATE A TEMPERAMENT\nTHAT SHOWS RESTRAINT AND TREAT HILLARY CLINTON WITH RESPECT.\nTHIS IS ABOUT THE FUTURE, NOT ABOUT THE PAST.\nTHE WEIGHTING PEOPLE PLACE ON ISSUES, HE WILL ARGUE SUPREME\nCOURT, TAXES AND ISI AND CHANGE AND ESTABLISH, HILLARY CLINTON\nTHAT YOU ARE CHANGE AND THAT PEOPLE IN BARACK OBAMA'S WORDS\nTHAT PEOPLE BELIEVE YOU COULD SHARE THEIR VALUES AND THE\nFUTURE IS BETTER THAN THE PAST. >> JON, JUST ONE FINAL THOUGHT,\nWE HAVE ABOUT 30 SECONDS TO GO. SORRY, I THINK WE'VE LOST JON\nTHERE. JIM, WE HAVE 30 SECONDS TO GO.\nIS THE ELECTION OVER. A LOT OF POLITICAL SCIENTISTS\nWOULD SAY, AT THIS POINT NOTHING MATTERS, IT IS ALL BAKED IN.\n>> SO NOTHING IS CERTAIN IN POLITICS OR THIS YEAR IN\nPARTICULAR. BUT IT WOULD REQUIRE THINGS EVEN\nMORE UNUSUAL THAN WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST YEAR FOR DONALD\nTRUMP TO RECOVER AT THIS POINT. WHEN HE HAS SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS\nOF HIS OWN PARTY LEADERS SAYING THEY ARE NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR\nHIM. THE LAST TIME WE WOULD HAVE SEEN\nTHIS WOULD HAVE BEEN WITH THE CASE MORE THAN A CENTURY AGAIN\nAND YOU WOULD HAVE TO BET MONEY AGAINST HIS PROSPECTS RIGHT NOW.\n>> JIM FALLOWS, KATHLEEN HALL JAMIESON AND JON MEACHAM IN\nABSENTIA, A FASCINATING CONVERSATION.\nTHANK YOU ALL. >> THANK YOU.\n>> DON'T FORGET TONIGHT'S PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE, THE SECOND\nOF THREE. THIS TIME MODERATED BY OUR OWN\nANDERSON COOPER IS HERE AT 9:00 P.M. EASTERN AND 6:00 P.M.\nPACIFIC, DO NOT MISS. >> NEXT ON GPS, IBM WATSON WON\nJEOPARDY BUT NOW IT HAS MOVED ON TO MUCH BIGGER THINGS, LIKE\nHELPING MAKE SURE CANCER PATIENTS GET BETTER AND MAYBE\nHELPING YOU DO YOUR JOB BETTER. IS IT A HOPEFUL FUTURE OR A\nFRIGHTENING ONE? I'LL ASK THE CEO OF IBM WHEN WE\nCOME BACK.",

LOUIS WHERE THE DEBATE WILL TAKE\nPLACE, THE DEBATE WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR HE IS LESS THAN TEN\nHOURS FROM NOW. THINK ABOUT WHERE WE ARE AND WHY\nTHIS TRUMP TAPE IS -- THIS VULGAR TAPE IS NOW THE TOP\nSTORY. THINK ABOUT HOW IT HAPPENED.\nWHEN TALKING TO BILLY BUSH, HE WAS THE STAR OF THE APPRENTICE\nAND TAPING FOR ACCESS HOLLYWOOD AND TALKING WITH BUSH GETTING\nREADY TO TAPE A CAMEO AND THIS IS ALL ABOUT NBC.\nAND AFTER THAT ASSOCIATED PRESS STORY CAME OUT ON MONDAY BEFORE\nTRUMP'S TIME BEHIND THE SCENES OF \"THE APPRENTICE\" AND ACCESS\nHOLLYWOOD WENT LOOKING IN THE ARCHIVES FROM THAT BILLY BUSH\nAND DONALD TRUMP TAPE. THEY FOUND IT AND PREPARED TO\nCOVER IT AND BROADCAST IT AND THEY GOT NBC NEWS INVOLVED AS\nWELL. BOTH THE NEWS DIVISION AND THE\nENTERTAINMENT SIDE OF THE HOUSE WERE READY TO REPORT ON THIS\nTAPE. BUT NOT UNTIL AT LEAST NEXT\nWEEK. ACCORDING TO SOURCES AT NBC,\nTHERE WERE LEGAL ISSUES TO DEAL WITH, MAKING SURE THE CORPORATE\nLAWYERS WERE ALL ON BOARD. THIS WAS GOING TO BROADCAST,\nTHEY SWEAR IT WAS GOING TO, BUT THEN IT GOT LEAKED TO THE\nWASHINGTON POST. \"THE WASHINGTON POST\" RECEIVED A\nCOPY OF THE TAPE ON FRIDAY AND WITHIN FIVE HOURS PUBLISHED A\nSTORY THAT YOU'VE NOW SEEN ON LOOP ALL ACROSS TELEVISION.\nSO NBC DID NOT BREAK ITS OWN NEWS AND YET THAT NEWS IS NOW A\nHUGE PART OF THE DEBATE TONIGHT. LET'S TALK ABOUT IT AND THE\nHISTORICAL CONTEXT OF WHAT IS UNFOLDING IN THIS CAMPAIGN WITH\nTHREE EXPERTS, INCLUDING CAROL SIMPSON WHO WAS A MODERATOR OF A\nDEBATE TOWN HALL. ALSO DOUGLAS BRINKLEY, CNN\nPRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN AND HISTORY PROFESSOR AT RICE\nUNIVERSITY AND JEFF GREEN FIELD WITH CNN AND OTHER NETWORKS OVER\nTHE YEARS. I APPRECIATE YOU ALL BEING HERE\nTHIS MORNING TO BRING US CONTEXT.\nJEFF, DO YOU BELIEVE THERE IS A PROBLEM FOR NBC, THAT BILLY BUSH\nCO-HOST OF THE TODAY SHOW HAS BEEN CAUGHT ON THIS TAPE JOKING\nAROUND WITH TRUMP ABOUT WOMEN GENITALIA, ABOUT HOW HOT THE\nWOMEN ARE AND IN EXPLICIT WAYS, IS IT A PROBLEM FOR NBC THAT\nBILLY BUSH WORKS FOR THE \"TODAY\" SHOW AND THAT THEY DIDN'T\nBROADCAST THEIR OWN TAPE? >> YOU KNOW, ONCE YOU GET A\nBUNCH OF CORPORATE LAWYERS IN A ROOM, SPEEDY ACTION IS THE LEFT\nTHING YOU WOULD EXPECT. AND I DON'T REALLY HAVE A STRONG\nFEELING ABOUT WHETHER NBC SHOULD HAVE GONE AHEAD WITH IT.\nFOR ME, THE MUCH BIGGER ISSUE IS WHY THIS TAPE PRODUCES THE\nREACTION IT DID WHEN A YEAR'S WORTH OF OTHER EVIDENCE DIDN'T.\nTHE QUESTION THAT I WOULD HAVE ASKED ALL OF THESE REPUBLICANS\nNOW, BACKING AWAY FROM TRUMP, IS WHAT DIDN'T YOU KNOW AND WHEN\nDIDN'T YOU KNOW IT. SO TO BE CANDID WITH YOU, BRIAN,\nI DON'T FIND THE INTERNAL DEBATE WITHIN A CORPORATION ABOUT\nWHETHER THEY COULD RELEASE A TAPE OR WHAT THE LEGAL PROBLEMS\nARE TO BE AT THE CENTER OF THE CONCERN ABOUT THIS.\nTO ME, IT IS -- IT TELLS US SOMETHING VERY SIGNIFICANT ABOUT\nTHE MEDIA AND ALSO, BY THE WAY, ABOUT THE NEW MEDIA THAT A\nPRINTOUT LIKE \"THE WASHINGTON POST\" COULD SHOW A VIDEO THAT\nTHE VIDEO PURVEYORS DIDN'T SHOW. THERE IS A CERTAIN IRONY THERE.\nTHAT MAY NOT BE THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION.\n>> GOOD POINT. >> BUT WE WANT TO KEEP THE FOCUS\nON THE EXTRAORDINARY GAP BETWEEN WHAT THIS TAPE PRODUCES AMONG\nTHE REPUBLICAN ELITES AND OFFICE HOLDERS AND YEARS WORTH OF WHAT\nOTHER EVIDENCE DIDN'T. >> CAROL, AS SOMEONE WHO HAS\nMODERATED A TOWN HALL-STYLE DEBATE IN THE PAST, WHAT DO YOU\nDO TO CHALLENGE CLINTON AND TRUMP TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE\nKNOWING THAT CLINTON WILL SPEAK FIRST AND GETTING THE FIRST\nQUESTION. HOW DO YOU BRING THIS TOPIC UP\nAND ADDRESS IT AND NOT LET IT EVOLVE INTO SOMETHING EVEN MORE\nCOURSE THAN WE'VE ALREADY HEARD? >> WELL, THESE ARE GOING TO BE\nTHE PEOPLE'S QUESTIONS THAT ARE THERE.\nTHE UNDECIDED VOTERS. I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY ARE\nUNDECIDED AFTER ALL OF THIS TIME.\nBUT IT IS GOING TO BE THEIR QUESTIONS.\nAND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME EVER PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT TRUMP AND\nNOT THE RED SOX. SO EVERYBODY HAS HEARD THIS AND\nEVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT IT. AND I THINK IT IS GOING TO BE\nTHE FIRST QUESTION. I THINK THE MODERATORS ARE ABLE\nTO CHOOSE WHICH PERSON ASKS THE FIRST QUESTION.\nBUT I BET THAT FIRST QUESTION IS GOING TO BE ABOUT THE TAPE.\n>> WHEN IT COMES UP, WHEN TRUMP RESPONDS, WOULD YOU BE CONCERNED\nAS A MODERATOR ABOUT HAVING TO FACT CHECK EITHER OF THE\nCANDIDATES? DO YOU BELIEVE COOPER AND\nRADDATZ SHOULD BE PRO-ACTIVE IN THAT WAY?\n>> I WOULD BE. AND PROBABLY MR. FARNKOPF AND\nMURPHY WOULD NOT BE HAPPY WITH ME AS A MODERATOR.\nBUT I FEEL IF YOU ARE A JOURNALIST AND YOU KNOW THE\nTRUTH OF SOMETHING, AND YOU HEAR ONE OF THE CANDIDATES STATE AN\nUNTRUTH, I THINK IT IS AN OBLIGATION OF THE MODERATOR, WHO\nIS REPRESENTING THE PEOPLE, TO CORRECT THAT.\nSO, YEAH, I THINK THEY SHOULD FACT CHECK.\n>> DOUG BRINKLEY HERE WITH ME AT THE DEBATE SITE IN ST. LOUIS.\nTHINKING ABOUT THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT FOR WHAT WE'RE ABOUT TO\nSEE, HAS THERE BEEN A CANDIDATE WHO HAS COME INTO A DEBATE AS\nWOUNDED AS TRUMP IS COMING IN TONIGHT?\n>> NO. AND HE'S DECIMATED RIGHT NOW.\nAND I'M NOT SURE WHAT HE COULD DO.\nONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS HE TALKS ABOUT BILL CLINTON, EVERY TIME\nHE'S IN A JAM. HE IS NOT RUNNING AGAINST BILL\nCLINTON AND BY TIEING THE TWO TOGETHER CAUSES SOME PROBLEMS\nAND ALSO IF HE'S GOING AFTER THE CLINTON'S SEX CAP AIDS AND\nNAMING ALL OF THE WOMEN, THEN DO IT AND DO IT HARD AND TAKE ADS\nOUT LIKE HILLARY CLINTON IS DOING.\nTHIS IS A WAR RIGHT NOW AND DONALD TRUMP OF IS TWO MINDS ALL\nOF THE TIME. AND HE'S JUST GETTING\nPUMMELLED -- >> WELL TRUMP SUPPORTERS SAY THE\nWAR IS HAPPENING BY THE PRESS AND THE MEDIA IS ENGAGING IN\nTHIS. DO YOU BELIEVE IT IS THE MEDIA'S\nFAULT, SO TO SPEAK. HOW DO YOU APPORTION\nRESPONSIBILITY HERE. >> MEDIA FALLS -- NBC SHOULD\nHAVE HAD THAT TAPE RUNNING IN THE SPRING WHEN SOMEBODY IN THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY COULD HAVE PICKED SOMEBODY ELSE.\nWHY, AS A MAJOR NEWS ORGANIZATION, HOARDING A TAPE\nLIKE THAT, YOU WOULD THINK ONCE TRUMP TRACKS, NBC WOULD LOOK AT\nWHATEVER THEY HAVE. THEY ARE PUTTING UP RESOURCES\nAND SETTING UP CAMPS LIKE WE ARE AROUND THE COUNTRY.\n>> AND THE CLAIM IS THEY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT.\nWHY THEY DIDN'T LOOK IS ANOTHER QUESTION.\nJEFF GREENFIELD, WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR TONIGHT?\nTHE MEDIA EXPECTATIONS GAME HERE IS CRUCIAL?\n>> I DON'T MEAN TO BE SUPERFICIAL, THE FIRST THING I'M\nLOOKING FOR IS THE HANDSHAKE. WHETHER IT HAPPENS.\n>> YES, ME TOO. >> YEAH, BECAUSE IN 1990, ANN\nRICHARDS WON THE GOVERNORSHIP BECAUSE HER OPPONENT REFUSED TO\nSHAKE HANDS AT A DEBATE. ON THE OTHER HAND WHAT WE SAW AT\nTHE FIRST DEBATE, THE SMILES AND THE PAT ON THE BACK DONALD TRUMP\nGAVE CLINTON, I THINK -- I ACTUALLY THINK, HAVING BEEN IN\nROOMS OF DEBATE PREP, THEY ARE DEVOTING SERIESUS ATTENTION TO\nJUST HOW FORMAL THAT HANDSHAKE COULD BE AND HOW QUICKLY SHE\nCOULD DISENGAGE. AND I KNOW IT SOUNDS TRIVIAL BUT\nTHAT FIRST IMPRESSION VISUAL IS VERY SIGNIFICANT.\nAND THE SECOND THING THAT I'M REALLY, AS A FORMER DEBATE\nPREPARER, REALLY PUZZLED ABOUT IS WHAT DOES HILLARY CLINTON\nSAY, IF DONALD TRUMP GOES FULL BORE AFTER THE ACCUSATIONS OF\nBILL CLINTON'S PREDATORY BEHAVIOR.\nNOT AFFAIRS, BUT THE PAULA JONES AND JUANITA BROAD DRICK AND\nOTHERS. WHAT DOES SHE SAY AND WE NEED AN\nANSWER. >> AND IT IS PUTTING FACT INTO\nFICTION IN CONTEXT. I'M OUT OF TIME, CAROL, YOU'VE\nBEEN IN THE ROOM AND AS A MODERATOR, WHAT ADVICE DO YOU\nHAVE FOR END COOPER AND MARTHA RADDATZ RIGHT NOW?\n>> UM, THEY HAVE TO SEE THAT THE PEOPLE'S QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERED.\nAND YOU KNOW HOW TRUMP HAS THE TENDENCY TO DEFLECT AND TO\nCHANGE THE SUBJECT AND SO ON. AND I THINK THEY HAVE TO GET\nBACK TO THEM AND SAY, LOOK, YOU'VE BEEN ASKED BY MR. SO AND\nSO ABOUT THE TAPE, WHAT -- WE'D LIKE YOU TO ANSWER HIS QUESTION.\nSO I THINK THEY HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL TO SEE THAT THEY ARE\nGETTING THEIR QUESTIONS ANSWERED.\n>> THE PRESSURE IS ON BOTH MEN AND BOTH WOMEN ON THE STAGE.\nCAROL, JEFF, DOUG, THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE THIS MORNING.\nAND COMING UP AFTER A QUICK BREAK.\nA LOOK AT THE EXPECTATIONS AND INSIGHT FROM LIBERALS AND\nCONSERVATIVES ABOUT HOW THE DEBATE WILL BE PORTRAYED.\nI'LL BE RIGHT BACK IN JUST A MOMENT.",

BUT I GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH A\nSERIES OF REPUBLICANS INCLUDING A TOP RANKING MEMBER OF CONGRESS\nAND A STRATEGIST WITH CLOSE TIES TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND YOU\nSTART TO THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS LAST NIGHT.\nI'VE TOLD REINCE PRIEBUS HAS BEEN TELLING FOLKS WHO HAVE\nIDEAS ABOUT WHAT DO WE DO NOW. HOLD ON, LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS\nIN THE DEBATE AND SEE HOW THIS PLAYS OUT ON MONDAY AND MAKE\nRASH DECISIONS. HAVING SAID THAT, A COUPLE\nTHINGS THAT I'M HEARING ABOUT, NUMBER ONE, IS IT POSSIBLE THAT\nPENCE COULD ACTUALLY WALK AWAY FROM THE TICKET?\nI'M TOLD WHILE IT'S NOT LIKELY IT'S NOT OUTSIDE THE REALM OF\nPOSSIBILITY AND SOMEONE WHO WAS CLOSE TO MIKE PENCE TOLD ME HE'S\nTHE A MAN \"OF STRONG MORAL FIBER\" AND HE'S STRUGGLING WITH\nTHIS. NUMBER ONE.\nNUMBER TWO, COULD YOU GET DONALD TRUMP TO STEP DOWN?\nTHE PEOPLE I TALKED TO WERE UNANIMOUS ON IT.\nTHEY SAID THEY DON'T SEE IT HAPPENING, IN FACT ONE TOLD ME\nJUST MOMENTS AGO \"THIS IS A GUY WHO BELIEVES HE'S GOTTEN OUT OF\nEVERYTHING, WHETHER IT'S A MARRIAGE, A BANKRUPTCY, HIS\nMISSTATEMENTS ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\nI JUST DON'T SEE IT HAPPENING.\" BUT THERE HAVE BEEN\nCONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHETHER A GROUP OF REPUBLICAN SENATORS\nCOULD GO TO HIM AND TALK TO HIM, INCLUDING ROB PORTMAN BUT\nTHERE'S A BACKSIDE TO THAT. THE PUSHBACK HAS BEEN HE IS\nSOMEBODY WHO IS SO AGAINST THE ESTABLISHMENT WOULD THAT MAKE\nHIM DIG IN EVEN MORE? BUT CLEARLY THE STAKES FOR THIS\nTONIGHT, FOR THE SPIN, FOR HOW THIS PLAYS OUT IN THE PUBLIC\nTOMORROW COULDN'T BE HIGHER HALLIE.\n>> IT'S INTERESTING, I WANT TO GO BE TO YOUR NEW REPORTING\nBECAUSE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE IDEA THAT REPUBLICANS ARE\nWATCHING TONIGHT'S DEBATE I WILL TELL YOU I THINK THERE IS AN\nEXPECTATION THAT WE COULD SEE MORE REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF\nCONGRESS REVOKING THEIR SUPPORT OF DONALD TRUMP DEPENDING ON\nWHAT HAPPENS TONIGHT. DO YOU THINK THAT IS PLAYING\nINTO MIKE PENCE'S THOUGHT PROCESS AS WELL?\nHE SEEMED TO HINT AT IT WITH THAT STATEMENT YESTERDAY.\nWHAT ARE YOU HEARING? >> I THINK HE ABSOLUTELY DID.\nONE PERSON I TALKED TO POINTED THAT OUT BUT THERE'S ANOTHER\nFACTOR TO THIS IS THAT SOMEONE I SPOKE TO WHO IS AT A BIG\nREPUBLICAN EVENT LAST NIGHT SAID -- AND WHO WITHDREW HIS\nSUPPORT TOLD ME THAT NOT A SINGLE PERSON, NOT A SINGLE\nCONSTITUENT, NOT A SINGLE POLITICIAN GAVE HIM ANY\nPUSHBACK. IN FACT, HE SAID I THINK IT\nMAKES US LOOK STRONG. I THINK IT MAKES US LOOK AS\nTHOUGH WE HAVE CHARACTER WHILE THE DEMOCRATS DO NOT AS THEY\nCONTINUE TO SUPPORT, OF COURSE, WHAT REPUBLICANS BELIEVE IS A\nVERY FLAWED CANDIDATE. SO IF WHAT HE'S HEARING IS\nCORRECT, WHICH IS A LOT OF THESE REPUBLICANS WHO ONLY OVER THE\nLAST 24 HOURS HAVE PULLED OUT AND ARE NOT GETTING PUSHBACK BUT\nA MAJORITY OF SUPPORT FROM THEIR CONSTITUENTS, IT'S VERY POSSIBLE\nWE COULD SEE THIS HAPPEN MORE.

AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE THEIR\nFACESI UNLIKE THE OTHER DEBATE AND THE REGULAR CITIZENS\nUNDECIDED ARE NOT THERE TO PROVOKE AN ARGUMENT, A SOAP\nOPERA KIND OF ARGUMENT ABOUT MARITAL INFIDELITIES BUT SERIOUS\nCONCERNS. WE CAN SEE THE QUESTIONS THEY'RE\nLINING UP TO ASK, THINGS LIKE, WHAT HAPPENS TO SOCIAL SECURITY?\nAND IF DONALD TRUMP COMES OUT WANTING TO USE THIS OPPORTUNITY\nTO SORT OF SOIL THE CONVERSATION WITH THE DISCUSSION OF MARITAL\nINFIDELITY, I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO WORK WITH THIS\nPARTICULAR GROUP OF VOTERS AND I THINK WE'LL SEE IT ON THEIR\nFACES AND IT WILL HURT DONALD TRUMP.\n>> SO TODD, YOU THINK IT'S A MISTAKE IF HE IS TO PLAY, I'LL\nCALL IT THE BILL CARD.

ONE OF HIS MAINSTAYS IS TO TALK\nABOUT FREE TRADE, ANOTHER MAINSTAY IS TERRORISM AND HOW\nOUR BORDERS ARE TOO OPEN. ALL IS FAIR GAME WITH WHAT JUST\nCAME OUT ON WIKILEAKS BUT YOU HAVE TO DO IT ONE THING AT A\nTIME. HE CAN'T TRY TO MESH THOSE TWO\nIDEAS TOGETHER. >> YOURS IS OXFORD STYLE\nDEBATING AND WHAT I LOVE ABOUT IT IS YOU VOTE AT THE OUTSET OF\nTHE DEBATE AND THEN YOU VOTE AGAIN WHEN THE DEBATE HAS ENDED\nAND THE KEY HERE TO DECLARING VICTORY IS, WHO CHANGED THE MOST\nMINDS? HERE'S MY QUESTION.\nARE ANY MINDS UP TO BE CHANGED TOMORROW NIGHT?\n>> THE MINDS OF THE 40 PEOPLE ON STAGE THAT ARE SELECTED BY THE\nGALLUP ORGANIZATION BECAUSE THEY ARE UNDECIDED.\nAND AGAIN, I WANT TO SAY, THOSE PEOPLE ARE BRAVE TO BE PUT IN\nTHIS SITUATION.

IT'S AN INTERVIEW.\nIT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT INTERVIEW IN THE CAREERS OF\nEITHER OF THESE CANDIDATES. >> HEY, TODD, FINAL QUESTION.\nWHEN YOU REMOVE THAT PODIUM, YOU'RE EXPOSING THE CANDIDATES.\nSPEAK TO THE DYNAMIC OF NOT BEING ABLE TO SHIELD YOURSELF.\n>> LET ME TALK ABOUT THE POWER OF MOMENTUM.\nPEOPLE AT HOME. IF HILLARY CLINTON WINS THIS\nDEBATE GIVEN HOW MOMENTUM IS GOING BECAUSE I COACH DEBATES\nALL THE TIME AND MOMENTUM HAPPENS IN DEBATES.\nI THINK THERE COULD BE EVEN MORE VOTERS SWAYED BECAUSE IF HE\nLOSES TWO BADLY, NO WAY HE'LL GET AS MANY INDEPENDENT VOTES AS\nHE NEEDS. IN THIS DEBATE, YOU HAVE TO\nPRACTICE STANDING UP AND MOVING AROUND JUST LIKE YOU WOULD IN\nTHE REAL DEBATE.

YOUR HUSBAND WAS FOR A TIME A\nSTATE DELEGATE, A DEMOCRATIC DELEGATE IN THE STATE OF\nMARYLAND. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO HEAR FROM\nHER TONIGHT? >> I'D LIKE TO HEAR HONESTY.\nTHE QUESTIONS THAT THE PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE ARE ASKING ARE\nQUESTIONS THAT THE CANDIDATES ARE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE\nPREPARED FOR SO THEY SHOULD PROBABLY TAKE A MOMENT AND\nLISTEN TO THE QUESTION AND THEN GIVE AN HONEST ANSWER BECAUSE WE\nCAN SEE THROUGH THE EVASIVENESS. SO JUST HONESTY AND SPEAKING\nFROM THE HEART. >> ALL RIGHT.\nMARISSA HALL SUMMERS, WHO HAS A PLACE IN PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE\nHISTORY 24 YEARS AGO ASKING SUCH A POIGNANT QUESTION THAT REALLY\nSHOWED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CANDIDATES ON THAT STAGE AND\nGUARANTEED THERE WAS, AS THERE HAS BEEN, TOWN HALL STYLE DEBATE\nEVERY CYCLE.

THIS IS THE SITE OF THE PIVOTAL\nPRESIDENTIAL DEBATE JUST A FEW HOURS AWAY AND RIGHT NOW THE\nSTAKES REALLY COULDN'T BE HIGHER.\nRIGHT NOW THE DONALD TRUMP AND THE GOP ARE IN A STATE OF\nCRISIS. AND THE EXPECTATIONS FOR THE\nDEBATE HAVE CHANGED DRAMATICALLY AS A RESULT.\nIF THE READY-MADE NARRATIVE WAS ABOUT A COMEBACK PERFORMANCE FOR\nTRUMP AFTER MOST PEOPLE AGREED HE LOST THE FIRST DEBATE, WELL\nNOW IT IS ABOUT SURVIVAL. BY NOW YOU'VE HEARD THE TAPE SO\nLET ME TAKE YOU BEHIND THE SCENES ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING\nAS WE SPEAK. JUST A SHORT WALK AWAY FROM HERE\nON THE CAMPUS. THIS IS A TOWN HALL DEBATE WITH\nQUESTIONS FROM REAL VOTERS SO COMODERATORS ANDERSON COOPER AND\nMARTHA RADDATZ RECEIVED THE QUESTIONS FROM THOSE\nPARTICIPATING TONIGHT. ESSENTIALLY THE PEOPLE ON STAGE,\nTHE VOTERS WHO HAVE BEEN SELECTED BY GALLOP SUBMITTED\nTHEIR QUESTIONS AHEAD OF TIME AND NOW THEY ARE SORTING THROUGH\nTHE QUESTIONS TO DECIDE WHO TO CALL ON AND IN WHAT ORDER.\nBUT ONE THING IS ALREADY CERTAIN.\nACCORDING TO AN ABC SOURCE, THE MODERATORS WILL BEGIN WITH A SET\nOF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE VULGAR TAPE AND THE FALLOUT FROM IT.\nTHIS IS OBVIOUS AND IMPORTANT TO REPORT.\nWHY? BECAUSE IT IS NOT DONALD TRUMP\nWHO GETS THE FIRST QUESTION. ACCORDING TO A COIN TOSS BY THE\nCOMMISSION ON PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES, HILLARY CLINTON WILL\nASK THE -- WILL BE ASKED THE FIRST QUESTION AND SHE'LL HAVE\nTHE FIRST CHANCE TO SPEAK AT 9:00 P.M.

THERE IS TALK ABOUT MIKE PENCE\nTAKING OVER. TRUMP SAID HE IS IN THIS NO\nMATTER WHAT. DO YOU KNOW OF THE POSSIBILITY.\n>> WE HAVE NO IDEA. WE LIKE TO SAY WE TAKE THE\nCAMPAIGN AS IT COMES TO US. WHATEVER HAPPENS.\nAND WE HAVE NO IDEA -- FROM WHAT WE UNDERSTAND, WE'LL HAVE THREE\nDEBATES AND ONE VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE AND WE\nPREPARED FOR THAT AND IF SOMETHING CHANGES, WE'LL HANDLE\nTHAT WHEN IT COMES. >> BRIAN, WE HAVE VERY CLEAR\nCRITERIA THAT WE'VE HAD FOR OVER A YEAR NOW OF WHO GETS INVITED\nTO THE DEBATES AND WE'VE NOT EXTENDED INVITATIONS FOR THE\nTHIRD DEBATE YET. WE'LL DO THAT SEVERAL DAYS\nBEFORE THE OCTOBER 19th DEBATE. >> AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT\nIS IF GARY JOHNSON WERE TO GET OVER 15%, HE WOULD BE INVITED.\nSO FAR HE COULD NOT REACH THAT THRESHOLD.\n>> ANY CANDIDATE WHO IS OTHERWISE QUALIFIED, ACCORDING\nTO OUR CRITERIA AND THEREFORE JILL STEIN FROM THE GREEN PARTY\nAND GARY JOHNSON FROM THE LIBERTARIAN PARTY AND OBVIOUSLY\nTRUMP AND CLINTON, IF THEY REACH THAT 15% THRESHOLDER EXTENDED AN\nINVITATION. >> AND TAKE US BEHIND THE SCENES\nABOUT HOW DEBATE MODERATORS ARE CHOSEN.\nAND THIS YEAR THERE ARE FIVE AND THERE ARE COMODERATORS AND HOW\nIS THAT. >> AND WE'VE DONE SO MANY FROM\nTHE STANDPOINT OF THE PRODUCTION IS FAIRLY EASY.\nI MEAN, WE HAVE A GREAT CREW AND THEY DO A GREAT JOB.\nBUT PICKING THE MODERATORS IS PROBABLY THE MOST DIFFICULT\nTHING WE DO. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE\nDIVERSITY AMONG THE MODERATORS. WE TRY TO FIND PEOPLE BY LOOKING\nAT THEIR WORK PRODUCT ON TELEVISION.\nWE PRIMARILY HAVE GONE WITH ELECTRONIC MEDIA, PEOPLE USED TO\nWORKING WITH THIS THING IN THEIR EAR, HARDER THAN IT LOOKS.\nAND PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT TAKEN SIDES AND TRIED TO BE DOWN THE\nMIDDLE AND NOT BE BIAS ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.\nAND IT IS A DIFFICULT THING. AND WE SPEND TIME WITH THE STAFF\nTRYING TO COME UP WITH THE PEOPLE.\n>> THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR A FOX NEWS MODERATOR IS PART OF THE\nMIX, CHRIS WALLACE IN THE FINAL DEBATE.\nDID DONALD TRUMP INSIST ON A FOX MODERATOR.\n>> NO. AND WE DON'T LISTEN TO THE\nCANDIDATES WHEN WE CHOOSE. WE BASE IT ON WHO WE THINK WILL\nDO THE BEST JOB. AND WE WANT THE MODERATORS TO\nGET THE CANDIDATES TO ENGAGE EACH OTHER AND TALK ABOUT THE\nISSUES IMPORTANT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\nIT IS NOT ABOUT THE MODERATORS OR WHAT THEY THINK, IT IS ABOUT\nWHAT THE CANDIDATES WANT TO TALK ABOUT AS THEY THINK ABOUT THE\nFUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY AND AS THEY PRESENT SOME VISION ABOUT\nWHERE THEY ARE GOING TO GO AND YOU WANT MODERATORS THAT WILL\nEVOKE THAT KIND OF QUESTION. AND CHRIS WALLACE WILL BE ON --\nWITH CNN, HE'S DEMONSTRATED HE IS THAT KIND OF MODERATOR.\n>> AND THERE IS A VIGOROUS DEBATE ABOUT FACT CHECKING.\nLESTER HOLT DID DO THAT. DO YOU THINK THAT IS APPROPRIATE\nWITH MODERATORS. >> WE'VE SPENT TIME WITH THEM\nAND WE HAVE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WERE MODERATORS IN THE PAST\nWHO SPENT TIME WITH THEM. WE VIEW, AS MIKE SAID, THAT THE\nMODERATORS IS A FACILITATOR AND SHOULDN'T BE DOING THE FACT\nCHECKING. WHAT OUGHT TO HAPPEN, IF ONE\nCANDIDATE SAYS SOMETHING INCONSISTENT WITH WHAT SAID\nPREVIOUSLY, IT IS UP TO THE OTHER CANDIDATE TO CORRECT THEM.\nIF IT IS A SERIOUS MATTER. >> ARE YOU SAYING LESTER HOLT\nWAS WRONG? >> NO.\nI THINK HE DID A GREAT JOB. ON ONE INSTANCE, HE MAY HAVE\nSAID SOMETHING WRONG BUT I THINK HE DID A GREAT JOB.\n>> AND BRIAN, I DON'T THINK HE WAS STEPPED IN VERY OFTEN ON\nTHAT. I THINK THERE WERE TIMES WHEN HE\nTRIED TO MOVE THE DEBATE ALONG TO THE NEXT SUBJECT AND THAT IS\nTHE ROLE THE MODERATOR PLAYS TO INTRODUCE THE NEXT SUBJECT AND\nANOTHER THING WE'VE DONE HERE IS RATHER THAN HAVING A HIGHLY\nSTRUCTURED FORMAT IN THESE DEBATES WE'VE OPENED IT UP SO\nTHERE ARE LARGER CHUNKS OF TIME SO THE CANDIDATES CAN TALK TO\nEACH OTHER AND I HOPE THEY COULD TALK TO EACH OTHER WITHOUT\nCONSTANTLY INTERRUPTING EACH OTHER BUT WE ARE STRUCTURING\nTHIS SO THERE IS MORE OF A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE CANDIDATES\nRATHER THAN BACK AND FORTH WITH THE MODERATOR.\n>> SHOULD THERE BE BUZZERS OR WAYS TO CUT OFF MIKES.\nTIM KAINE WAS CRITICIZED FOR INTERRUPTING TOO MUCH.\n>> WE HAVE DISCUSSED THAT. BUT WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS\nHAVE A DEBATE. WE WANT THE CANDIDATES TO HAVE\nINTERACTION. AND IF YOU CUT OFF MIKES, YOU\nDON'T KNOW WHEN IS THE RIGHT TIME TO DO IS.\nSO WE DECIDED TO LET THEM GO AT IT.\nTHE MODERATOR HAS TO DO THE BEST JOB THEY COULD TO SLOW IT DOWN\nSO WE COULD HEAR EACH OTHER AND WE WANT THAT INTERACTION.\n>> AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT THE\nCHARACTER OF THE PERSON IF THEY ARE BEHAVING A CERTAIN WAY ON\nTHE STAGE AND THAT IS PART OF THE PROCESS OF EDUCATING THE\nPUBLIC ABOUT WHO THE FOLKS ARE IN THE FIRST PLACE.\n>> SHOULD THE DEBATES BE HELD SOONER GIVEN THAT EARLY VOTING\nIS MORE PROMINENT. >> WE MOVED THIS ONE UP.\nWE HAD ONE IN SEPTEMBER. AND WE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THAT.\nAND REALIZED THAT THE CONVENTIONS ARE EARLIER THAN\nTHEY USUALLY WERE. BUT SOMETHING LIKE 40% OF THE\nPEOPLE HAVE VOTED YEARS AGO BY ELECTION DAY.\nBUT WE TRIED TO MOVE IT UP CLOSER AND WE'LL LOOK AT IT\nAGAIN BETWEEN THIS AND THE NEXT ROUND.\n>> AND I'M COMING UP AGAINST A HARD BREAK.\nDO YOU BELIEVE THEY WILL SHAKE HANDS TODAY?\nHOPING FOR A CORDIAL CONVERSATION.\n>> IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE THEY WON'T OR TREAT EACH OTHER WITH\nSOME MEASURE OF RESPECT. BUT IT IS LIKELY GOING TO GET\nHOT AS WELL. >> IT FEELS LIKE WE ARE IN THE\nGUTTER AND -- >> WELL THAT IS -- THAT IS THE\nDISSPIRITING THING, IS WHEN WE MOVE AWAY FROM ISSUES THAT WE\nKNOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CARE ABOUT, THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT\nIMMIGRATION, THE ECONOMY, NATIONAL SECURITY, TERRORISM,\nTHE ISSUES THAT I THINK DEFINE WHAT WE WANT TO THINK ABOUT AS\nWE GO TO THE NEXT PRESIDENT AND WHAT THEY WILL DO FOR THE\nCOUNTRY. >> MIKE AND FRANK, THANK YOU\nBOTH FOR SHARING TIME WITH US THIS MORNING.\nAND BEST OF LUCK HERE TONIGHT.",

WHAT SHOULD DONALD TRUMP AND\nHILLARY CLINTON DO IN TONIGHT'S REMATCH?\nWE'RE TAKING A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE ON THIS AND JOINING\nME IS JON MEACHAM, AUTHOR OF THE RECENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH\nBIOGRAPHY, KATHLEEN HALL JAMIESON FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF\nPENNSYLVANIA AND JAMES FALLOW, THE NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT FOR\n\"THE ATLANTIC.\" JIM, LET ME START WITH YOU.\nYOU WERE THE CHIEF SPEECHWRITER TO JIMMY CARTER AND YOU DESCRIBE\nTHAT AS BEING LIKE FDR'S TAP DANCE INSTRUCTOR.\nSO HERE WE HAVE ANOTHER, SHALL WE SAY, A DIFFICULT PERSON TO\nCOACH IN DONALD TRUMP. AND I WANT TO START WITH THAT\nBECAUSE WE CAN GO BACK IN HISTORY BUT TRUMP HAS NEVER BEEN\nSOMETHING QUITE LIKE HIM. WHAT HAVE YOU OBSERVED, LOOKING\nAT THE PRIMARY DEBATES, LOOKING AT THE FIRST DEBATE, WHAT'S THE\nBIG TAKEAWAY FOR YOU ABOUT DONALD TRUMP?\n>> I THINK THE BIG TAKEAWAY IS THAT HIS NATURAL STYLE, WHICH\nSEEMS TO BE THE ONLY STYLE WE'RE EVER GOING TO GET OUT OF HIM,\nWAS A MUCH BETTER MATCH FOR THE PRIMARY DEBATES THAN IT HAS BEEN\nAT LEAST IN THIS FIRST ELECTION DEBATE.\nHE TENDS TO PLAY TO A CROWD AND BIG CHEERING AUDIENCES AND IN\nTHE PRIMARY DEBATES THERE WERE TEN PEOPLE THERE OR MORE AND HE\nCOULD MAKE LITTLE ZINGERS ABOUT HIS OPPONENTS AND PUTTING THEM\nDOWN AND DIDN'T HAVE TO ADDRESS QUESTIONS HE DIDN'T WANT TO\nADDRESS. THAT'S BEEN DIFFERENT SO FAR AND\nHE'S HAD TO FUMBLE TO GET BEYOND HIS TALKING POINTS AND ALSO IN\nTHE GENERAL ELECTION DEBATE, HE'S UP AGAINST A WOMAN.\nTHAT'S HAPPENED ONLY ONCE WHEN HE WAS THERE WITH CARLY FIORINA.\nHISTORICALLY, DONALD TRUMP IS AT HIS LEAST AGGRESSIVE AND MOST\nABASH WHEN HAVING A WOMAN FACE-TO-FACE.\nTHOSE ARE THE THREE BIG THINGS THAT HIS NATURAL TRAITS WERE\nGOOD FOR HIM IN THE PRIMARIES BUT LESS GOOD FOR HIM IN THE\nGENERAL. >> JON MEACHAM, WHEN YOU LOOK AT\nBUSH SENIOR, THERE IS A FAMOUS MOMENT IN '92 WHICH I THINK\nABOUT BECAUSE IT WAS A TOWN HALL AND A WOMAN ASKS BUSH ABOUT THE\nNATIONAL DEBT AND BUSH GIVES A VERY WONKY ANSWER AND THEN THE\nSAME QUESTION IS PUT TO CLINTON AND CLINTON MOVES IN TO HER,\nUNDERSTANDS THAT SHE REALLY IS NOT ACTUALLY ASKING ABOUT THE\nNATIONAL DEBT, IS JUST EXPRESSING SOME KIND OF ECONOMIC\nANXIETY AND RELATES TO HER. TALK ABOUT HOW THE TOWN HALL\nDYNAMIC IS DIFFERENT FROM A DEBATE DYNAMIC.\n>> OH, I THINK IN SOME WAYS THE 20th CENTURY ENDED THAT NIGHT IN\nRICHMOND. BUSH HAD LOOKED AT HIS WATCH, HE\nHAD GOTTEN UP AND ATTEMPTED TO BE SORT OF A PHIL DONAHUE SORT\nOF FIGURE. HE MISUNDERSTOOD THE QUESTION.\nAND ACTUALLY, ACTUALLY SAID THE WORDS I GUESS I DON'T GET IT.\nAND THE CLINTON AIDES WERE HIGH-FIVING EACH OTHER BECAUSE\nTHAT CAPTURED THE ENTIRE DYNAMIC.\nAND CLINTON WAS A CREATURE OF TOWN HALLS, A CREATURE OF CABLE\nTELEVISION IN THE SAME WAY DONALD TRUMP IS A CREATURE OF\nSOCIAL MEDIA AND REALITY TELEVISION.\nSO MASTERING THE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION OF YOUR ERA IS\nCRITICAL TO POLITICAL SUCCESS IN A DEMOCRACY LIKE THIS.\nGEORGE H.W. BUSH, FOR ALL HIS MANY, MANY VIRTUES, SIMPLY WAS\nNOT IN HIS -- BY 1992. AND SO I THINK THE TOWN HALL FOR\nTRUMP IS GOING TO BE A VERY INTERESTING QUESTION.\nHE TENDS, LIKE MOST SALESMEN, TO TRY TO TAKE ON THE COLORATION OF\nTHE AUDIENCE TO WHICH HE'S SPEAKING, AS JIM JUST SAID.\nWILL HE ATTEMPT TO WIN THAT PERSON OVER, THAT QUESTIONER\nOVER AND THAT LEADS HIM, AS WE'VE SEEN BEFORE IN DIFFERENT\nINTERVIEWS, HE'LL ASSERT DIFFERENT POLICY POINTS.\nTHAT'S A STRONG TERM FOR WHAT HE ASSERTS.\nI APOLOGIZE. HE'LL ASSERT CERTAIN POSITIONS\nBECAUSE HE THINKS THAT'S WHAT THAT PERSON WANTS TO HEAR.\nTHIS MAY BE A VERY LONG MONDAY OF CLEANING UP VARIOUS THINGS\nTHAT HE SAYS TO THAT PERSON IN THAT MOMENT.\n>> KATHLEEN, WHAT STRIKES YOU ABOUT THIS DEBATE THAT'S NEW OR\nHAS HISTORICAL REFERENCES. >> THIS IS A COMPLEX YEAR IN\nWHICH THE NUMBER OF ISSUES IN THE NATIONAL STAGE THAT THE\nPUBLIC ISN'T REALLY DEEPLY KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT IS ACTUALLY\nVERY HIGH. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS ABOUT A\nTOWN HALL FORMAT IS WHAT WILL THE ORDINARY VOTERS WHO STAND IN\nFOR US PUT ON THE AGENDA AS BEING IMPORTANT TO THEM AND HOW\nWILL THE CANDIDATES DEFINE THEIR SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES AND\nSIMILARITIES IN RELATIONSHIP TO THOSE CONCERNS.\nIT'S HISTORICALLY TRUE THAT DEBATES FORECAST GOVERNANCE AND,\nIMPORTANTLY, THEY CAN FORECAST WHERE THE CANDIDATES AGREE AS\nWELL AS DISAGREE BECAUSE TOWN HALL DEBATES TEND TO BE MORE\nCIVIL. THE AUDIENCE, TOWN HALLS, THE\nPEOPLE SITTING THERE ASKING QUESTIONS SEEM TO DEMAND IT.\n>> YOU KNOW, I THINK, KATHLEEN, ABOUT THAT SURVEY YOU DID IN\n2013, I THINK IT WAS, THAT 30% OF AMERICANS CAN'T NAME A SINGLE\nBRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. IT WILL BE INTERESTING.\nAUDIENCE, STAY RIGHT THERE. WE'LL BE BACK WITH MORE, SOME OF\nTHE BIGGEST HISTORICAL BLOOPERS, WHEN WE COME BACK.",

IT'S GOING TO MOVE OFFSHORE, BUT\nWE'RE NOT DONE WITH IT BY ANY MEANS.\nAND FLORIDA DIDN'T SEE THE CENTER COME ONSHORE, BUT THE\nBEACHES WERE VERY DAMAGED AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW ACROSS THE\nCAROLINAS IS CATASTROPHIC FOR SOME.\nAND WE HAVE A REALLY LONG NIGHT AHEAD OF US.\nWINDS STILL STRONG, GUSTING TO 71 IN MYRTLE BEACH ABOUT A HALF\nAN HOUR AGO. STILL VERY STRONG NOW, OFFSHORE\nWINDS, BUT THE STORM IS MOVING OFF TOWARDS THE NORTHEAST.\nAND THIS RAIN BAND YOU SEE PRIMARILY NOW IN TOWARDS NORTH\nCAROLINA, HEADING UP TOWARDS VIRGINIA IS EXTREME.\nWE HAVE TORNADO CONDITIONS, TORNADO WARNINGS, ESPECIALLY\nACROSS EASTERN AREAS OF NORTH CAROLINA.\nBUT PARTS OF INTERSTATE 95 ARE CLOSED DOWN BECAUSE OF THE\nFLOODING. WE HAVE REPORTS OF NUMEROUS\nBRIDGES AND ROADS THAT HAVE BEEN CUT OFF AND PEOPLE CANNOT GET\nTHROUGH AT ALL. AND YOU SEE THE RAIN FALL VERY\nHEAVY ACROSS A VERY WIDE SWATH. THIS RED HERE, THAT IS FLASH\nFLOODING THAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW.\nPROBABLY HALF OF THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA HAS FLASH\nFLOODING THAT IS OCCURRING RIGHT NOW.\nAND WE'RE GOING TO SEE THIS SPREAD, I THINK, LIKELY, IN\nTOWARDS PARTS OF VIRGINIA. THE REASON FOR THAT IS YOU CAN\nSEE, THE RAIN WAS HEAVY. WE SAW ABOUT A FOOT OF RAIN IN\nSAVANNAH. BUT YOU GO HERE ALREADY ACROSS\nSOUTH CAROLINA, NORTH CAROLINA, WE'RE GETTING MORE MOISTURE\nWRUNG OUT OF THIS STORM AND THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN\nOVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS. OVERNIGHT TONIGHT, STILL ACROSS\nAREAS OF NORTH CAROLINA AND VIRGINIA, BY NOON TOMORROW, IT'S\nGONE, MOVES OFFSHORE, WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE LOOKING AT ANY KIND\nOF REORGANIZATION FROM THIS. THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS.\nTHE BAD NEWS IS BEFORE THAT HAPPENS, TAKE A LOOK AT THIS,\nSHANNON.

BUT THERE ARE ARE SCENES LIKE\nTHIS ALL OVER SAVANNAH AND GEORGIA EISSUE SPECIAL WHEN YOU\nTHIS IS A WATER OAK. AND THE ROOT SYSTEM ARE SHALLOW.\nAND THIS STARTED TO TIP AND SPLIT AND BROUGHT DOWN A POWER\nPOLL. THE ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD IS PITCH\nBLACK DARK. A SAD STORY TO REPORT ABOUT\nA MAN IN HIS 40s, A HUSBAND AND A FATHER OF TWO LITTLE KIDS WAS\nHOME ALONE WATCHING THE HOUSE. AND POLICE TESTIFYING US THAT\nA TRIT HIT IN AND A MASSIVE PINE TREE FELL ON TO THE MASTER\nPEDROOM AND THE PICTURE HERE TELLS THE STORY OF WHAT HAPPENED\nAND HOW BAD IT WAS.

ANOTHER MASSIVE RIVER OAK LIKE\nTHIS ONE BEHIND ME, FEEL OUTSIDE OF HER BED ROOM AND BRUSHED THE\nWINDOW. AND SHE WAS FEET AWAY OF\nSUFFERING A SLFR FATE. SHE WOULDN'T HEAR THE TREES\nCOMING DOWN BECAUSE THE WIND WAS SO POWERFUL.\n>> THAT IS TRAGIC AND PEOPLE WERE TOLD TO STAY HOME AND DON'T\nGO IN YOUR CARS WITH THE RAIN AND FLOODING AND STEVE MENTIONED\nWITH A MOM AND CHILD OUT THERE, THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO STAY HOME\nAND THIS MAN STAYED HOME AND WAS KILLED.\nIT IS HORRIBLE AND HEART BREAKING.\nYOU WERE IN THE THICK OF IT THIS MORNING AND NOTHING LIKE WHAT IT\nIS NOW WHEN THE STORM BROKE RECORDS; WHAT WAS IT LIKE?\n>> WE WERE OUT HERE AND SPENT 12 HOURS LAST NIGHT OVERNIGHT IN\nTHE MORNING DOING LIVE SHOT. IT WAS A SLOW MOVING STORMS AND\nLIKE A POWERFUL SOUTHERN THUNDERSTORM THAT THOSE IN\nGEORGIA ARE USED TOP. AND THEN IT PICKED UP AND I\nREALIZE WE ARE IN A HURRICANE NOW.\nAND FEELING THE WIND GUSTS OF 80 OR 90 MILES PER HOUR.\nAND WIND GUSTS CLOSE TO 100 MILES PER HOUR.\nAND STORM SURGE, HIGHEST THAT SAVANNAH HAS EVER SEEN CAME IN\nLAST NIGHT.

IT WILL PULL OFFSHORE\nEVENTUALLY, BUT THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN UNTIL ABOUT\nTOMORROW AFTERNOON. SO BECAUSE OF THAT, WE STILL\nHAVE A VERY LONG NIGHT AHEAD OF US, ESPECIALLY INTO SOUTH\nCAROLINA. RAINFALL RATES ARE GOING UP,\nEVEN THOUGH THE STORM IS WEAKENING, AT LEAST IN ITS WIND\nINTENSITY. WE'VE SEEN RAINFALL TOTALS\nAROUND A FOOT IN SAVANNAH, BUT YOU SEE EVEN HIGHER THAN THAT\nACROSS PARTS OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND NORTH CAROLINA.\nAND A LOT MORE RAIN TO BE HAD. BECAUSE OF THAT, ALL THE\nFLOODING CONCERNS GOING ON, FLASH FLOODING GOING ON ACROSS A\nGOOD PART OF THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA, STRETCHING IN TOWARDS\nVIRGINIA, AS WELL. AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE\nTHE RAIN CONTINUE TO FALL IN ACROSS PARTS OF THE DELMARVA,\nPUSH A LOT OF SURGE EVEN IN TOWARDS THAT AREA AS WELL AS\nPART OF THE OUTER BANKS. THE STORM IS OFF THE SHORE OF\nSOUTH CAROLINA, BUT WE'RE WATCHING IT KIND OF INTERACT\nWITH A COLD FRONT THAT IS GOING TO PUSH IT OUT OF HERE\nEVENTUALLY, BUT WHAT HAPPENS IN THE MEANTIME IS THAT WRINGS A\nLOT OF THAT MOISTURE OUT. YOU'LL NOTICE IT'S GONE BY\nMIDDAY TOMORROW, STILL BREEZY CONDITIONS, BUT AT LEAST THE\nRAIN IS OVER. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE FLOODING\nWILL BE GONE, BECAUSE ALL THIS RAIN HAS TO GO SOMEWHERE.\nTHE SMALLER STREAMS WILL LEAD INTO SOME OF THE BIGGER RIVERS\nIN NORTH CAROLINA AND CAUSE MAJOR FLOODING.\nAND WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF RAIN TO BE HAD.\nTAKE A LOOK AT THIS. WE'RE GOING TO SEE SOME SPOTS.\nTHERE'S KIND OF A FEEDER BAND THAT IS LINING UP HERE ACROSS\nTHE OUTER BANKS. AND AS THAT BAND LINES UP, AND\nWE'RE PRETTY CONFIDENT THIS BEING IN THE SCOPE OF IT, A LOT\nOF AREAS IN THE 6 SO 10 INCH RANGE OF ADDITIONAL RAINFALL.\nSOME SPOTS MORE THAN THAT.

THE CAMPAIGN TWEETED RESPONSE,\nQUOTE, THIS IS HORRIFIC. WE CANNOT ALLOW THIS MAN TO\nBECOME PRESIDENT. THAT WAS DONE UNDER HILLARY\nCLINTON'S TWITTER ACCOUNT. HER RUNNING MATE, TIM KAINE, WAS\nIN NEVADA. HE'S NOW LEFT NEVADA, BUT BEFORE\nLEAVING, HE RESPONDED TO THE AUDIOTAPE.\nHERE'S WHAT HE SAID. >> ANY REPUBLICAN WHO HAS SAID\nTHEY ARE FOR DONALD TRUMP, THEY NEED TO BE ASKED BY THE PRESS\nAND OTHERS AND BY CONSTITUENTS RIGHT NOW, DO YOU STILL THINK\nHE'S QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES?\n>> Reporter: THERE HAVE BEEN TWO MORE NEWSPAPERS THAT HAVE\nENDORSED HILLARY CLINTON TODAY. \"THE BOSTON GLOBE\" AND ALSO THE\n\"ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH\" HERE IN ST. LOUIS, THE SITE OF THE\nDEBATE TOMORROW. SO FAR, DONALD TRUMP HAS NOT HAD\nANY NEWSPAPERS ENDORSE HIM. AND IT'S HARD TO SEE AFTER THIS\nAUDIOTAPE WAS RELEASED THAT ANY WOULD BE DOING SO ANYTIME SOON.\nBACK TO YOU GUYS. >> YOU CAN STICK WITH US JUST\nFOR A SECOND. PETER, I THINK WE STILL HAVE\nYOU. DO WE HAVE PETER?\n>> Reporter: I'M HERE. >> I WANTED TO ASK YOU\nSOMETHING. JUST BEFORE WE CAME TO AIR,\nTHERE WAS REPORTING THAT MIKE PENCE HAD ACTUALLY CALLED DONALD\nTRUMP YESTERDAY, THEY TALKED ABOUT THE SITUATION AND THE\nCOMMENTS AND THAT PENCE TOLD HIM, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO\nHANDLE THE NEXT 48 HOURS ON YOUR OWN.\nHAVE YOU HEARD THAT, TOO?",

THEY'VE ALREADY HAD TROUBLE WITH\nTHIS IN RECENT WEEKS. STEVE HARRIGAN IS LIVE IN NORTH\nCAROLINA TO GIVE US AN UPDATE. >> Reporter: SHANNON, THE\nBACKSIDE OF THIS STORM IS LEAVE WRG I AM IN WILMINGTON, NORTH\nCAROLINA, BUT WITH IT, SOME HEAVY GUSTS OF WIND, AT TIMES\nMORE THAN 80 MILES AN HOUR. AND KICKING UP SOME 15-FOOT\nWAVES. THE DEATH TOLL ACROSS FOUR\nSTATES NOW HAS REACHED 11 AND THREE OF THOSE HERE IN NORTH\nCAROLINA AS WE SEE SOME TRANSFORMERS BLOW OUT BEHIND ME.\nTHE DEATH TOLL HERE IN NORTH CAROLINA HAS COME FROM PEOPLE\nOUT ON THE ROAD. WE'VE STILL SEEN A NUMBER OF\nPEOPLE OUT, DESPITE WARNINGS. ONE OF THOSE DEATHS FROM A CAR\nHYDROPLANING ON WATER ON THE ROAD, THE OTHERS CAME FROM\nSUBMERGED VEHICLES. WE SAW MORE THAN 40 WATER\nRESCUES TODAY HERE IN THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA.\nIN FAYETTEVILLE, ONE WOMAN WITH A YOUNG CHILD WAS RESCUED BY\nFIRST RESPONDERS FROM ABOUT 5 FEET OF WATER.\nBOTH MOTHER AND CHILD NOW DOING WELL.\nWHAT'S NEXT HERE AFTER THIS WIND WILL FINALLY DIE DOWN, COULD BE\nSEVERAL DAYS OF FLOODING. THE STORM HAS DUMPED 15 INCHES\nOF RAIN ON COASTAL NORTH CAROLINA, SO WE COULD SEE RIVERS\nSWELL BEYOND THEIR BANKS OVER THE NEXT DAY OR TWO.\nALSO, OFFICIALS ARE WARNING ABOUT THE INTEGRITY OF ROADS,\nINCLUDING SOME MAJOR ROADS, COULD BE COMPROMISED, ADDING TO\nTHE SEVERE DAMAGE, WHICH IS ALREADY ESTIMATED TO TOTAL MORE\nTHAN $6 BILLION.

VERY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RAIN\nTHAT IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO FALL.\nIT WILL PULL OFFSHORE EVENTUALLY, BUT THAT IS NOT\nGOING TO HAPPEN UNTIL ABOUT TOMORROW AFTERNOON.\nSO BECAUSE OF THAT, WE STILL HAVE A VERY LONG NIGHT AHEAD OF\nUS, ESPECIALLY INTO SOUTH CAROLINA.\nRAINFALL RATES ARE GOING UP, EVEN THOUGH THE STORM IS\nWEAKENING, AT LEAST IN ITS WIND INTENSITY.\nWE'VE SEEN RAINFALL TOTALS AROUND A FOOT IN SAVANNAH, BUT\nYOU SEE EVEN HIGHER THAN THAT ACROSS PARTS OF SOUTH CAROLINA\nAND NORTH CAROLINA. AND A LOT MORE RAIN TO BE HAD.\nBECAUSE OF THAT, ALL THE FLOODING CONCERNS GOING ON,\nFLASH FLOODING GOING ON ACROSS A GOOD PART OF THE STATE OF NORTH\nCAROLINA, STRETCHING IN TOWARDS VIRGINIA, AS WELL.\nAND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE THE RAIN CONTINUE TO FALL IN\nACROSS PARTS OF THE DELMARVA, PUSH A LOT OF SURGE EVEN IN\nTOWARDS THAT AREA AS WELL AS PART OF THE OUTER BANKS.\nTHE STORM IS OFF THE SHORE OF SOUTH CAROLINA, BUT WE'RE\nWATCHING IT KIND OF INTERACT WITH A COLD FRONT THAT IS GOING\nTO PUSH IT OUT OF HERE EVENTUALLY, BUT WHAT HAPPENS IN\nTHE MEANTIME IS THAT WRINGS A LOT OF THAT MOISTURE OUT.\nYOU'LL NOTICE IT'S GONE BY MIDDAY TOMORROW, STILL BREEZY\nCONDITIONS, BUT AT LEAST THE RAIN IS OVER.\nTHAT DOESN'T MEAN THE FLOODING WILL BE GONE, BECAUSE ALL THIS\nRAIN HAS TO GO SOMEWHERE. THE SMALLER STREAMS WILL LEAD\nINTO SOME OF THE BIGGER RIVERS IN NORTH CAROLINA AND CAUSE\nMAJOR FLOODING. AND WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF RAIN\nTO BE HAD. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.\nWE'RE GOING TO SEE SOME SPOTS. THERE'S KIND OF A FEEDER BAND\nTHAT IS LINING UP HERE ACROSS THE OUTER BANKS.\nAND AS THAT BAND LINES UP, AND WE'RE PRETTY CONFIDENT THIS\nBEING IN THE SCOPE OF IT, A LOT OF AREAS IN THE 6 SO 10 INCH\nRANGE OF ADDITIONAL RAINFALL. SOME SPOTS MORE THAN THAT.\nSO THE FLOODING THROUGHOUT THE OVERNIGHT HOURS AND THE START OF\nTHE DAY ON SUNDAY IS GOING TO BE EXTREME, ESPECIALLY ACROSS PARTS\nOF INLAND NORTH CAROLINA.

MIKE PENCE IS HEADED TONIGHT TO\nPROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND WHERE HE'LL BE ATTENDING A PRIVATE\nFUNDRAISER.

THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS TO BE\nOUTRAGED ABOUT. WHEN I WEIGH THE SCALES, WE'RE\nLOOKING AT FOUR YEARS, HILLARY CLINTON WANTS OPEN BORDERS.\nSHE DOESN'T WANT TO ENFORCE OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS.\nSHE WANTS TO TAKE MY GUNS. >> I WANT TO GET BACK TO THE\nCOMMENTS AT HAND. IT'S NOT JUST THAT THEY'RE\nCOMMENTS WHO ARE EXPLICIT OR LEWD OR COMMENTS I WOULDN'T WANT\nMY DAUGHTER OR ANYONE'S CHILDREN TO HEAR.\nTHESE ARE AGGRESSIVE COMMENTS. >> IT SOUNDS A LOT LIKE HIP HOP\nMUSIC. >> HIP HOP ARTISTS AREN'T\nRUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. >> OF COURSE THEY AREN'T.\nBUT IT'S THE CULTURE WE'RE IN.

ILLEGAL ACTIVITY.\n>> OF COURSE. >> BUT DID HE DO SEXUAL ASSAULT\nLIKE BILL CLINTON? >> HE CLAIMS HE DID.\nSECOND OF ALL, THE APOLOGY THAT DONALD TRUMP GAVE BOTH IN THE\nWRITTEN STATEMENT AND IN THE VIDEO WAS NOT REMORSEFUL.\nWAS NOT CONTRITE. IN FACT, HE EQUATED THE BEHAVIOR\nTO LOCKER ROOM BANTER. THAT'S LIKE SAYING, YOU KNOW,\nBOYS WILL BE BOYS.

I'M REALLY, REALLY INTERESTED IN\nTALKING ABOUT POLICY. I'M HOPING TOMORROW NIGHT IS NOT\nALL ABOUT THESE COMMENTS FROM 11 YEARS AGO BUT WHAT BOTH OF THESE\nCANDIDATES WANT TO DO FOR THE FUTURE.\nWE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR CHILDREN'S FUTURE, WE'RE TALKING\nABOUT THE BORDER THE HIGHER LEVEL OF CRIME BECAUSE OF THE\nFERGUSON EFFECTIVE.

MUSIC I HEAR BLARING.\n>> THEY'RE NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.\nTHEY HAVE A HIGHER STANDARD. >> EITHER YOU'RE OKAY WITH IT OR\nYOU'RE NOT. >> HOW DO WE TELL OUR SONS -- I\nHAVE A TEENAGE SON WHEN WE SAY THAT BEING SEXIST, BEING\nMASSAGENISTIC IS ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR.\nAND THEN HE WATCHES TELEVISION AND SEES OUR PRESIDENTIAL\nNOMINEE FROM A MAJOR PARTY FOR THE PRESIDENCY, WHAT DO WE TELL\nOUR SONS? WHAT DO WE SAY WHEN HE SAYS,\nWELL, YOU KNOW, ONE OF TWO PEOPLE WHO WILL BE THE NEXT\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS DOING IT, MOM.\nWHAT DO WE SAY? WHAT DO WE SAY TO THEM?\n>> IT'S WRONG BEHAVIOR. I JUST SAID THAT.\nI'VE SAID IT TWICE ON CNN TODAY. I'LL SAY IT ONE MORE TIME FOR\nYOU. IT'S WRONG BEHAVIOR.\nIT'S INCORRECT FOR HIM TO SPEAK THAT WAY.\nTHAT'S NOT THE ISSUE. >> I'D LIKE YOU TO LOOK AT THIS\nAS WE KEEK TALKING. THIS IS A BRAND-NEW TWEET.\nTHE MEDIA AND ESTABLISHMENT WANT ME OUT OF THE RACE SO BADLY, I\nWILL NEVER DROP OUT OF THE RACE. WILL NEVER LET MY SUPPORTERS\nDOWN. #MAGA.\nSTACY, YOUR THOUGHTS, DO YOU AGREE WITH HIM THIS IS THE\nESTABLISHMENT MEDIA'S FAULT? >> I THINK THAT THE FOCUS THAT\nWE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS THIS IS STORY THAT BROKE YESTERDAY.\nIT'S APPROPRIATE TO COVER IT. IT'S APPROPRIATE TO HAVE\nDISCUSSIONS ABOUT IT TO ASK QUESTIONS, TO HAVE SUPPORTERS\nON. I THINK THAT'S RIGHT.\nBUT TOMORROW NIGHT, AT THAT DEBATE, I WANT TO HEAR ABOUT\nPOLICY. I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT\nTO HEAR ABOUT POLICY. WHETHER IT'S THE ESTABLISHMENT\nOR WHOEVER IT IS, AND THE ST STORY --\n>> DONALD TRUMP EVERY DAY PREVENTS THAT FROM HAPPENING --\n>> PATTY YOU KNOW THE MIND OF H\nHILLARY CLINTON BETTER THAN ALMOST ANYONE.\nSHE HAS NOT SAID A WORD OTHER THAN PUTTING OUT A TWEET SAYING\nTHIS IS APPALLING. WHAT WILL SHE DO?\n>> IF I KNOW HER, THE WAY I THINK I KNOW HER, I THINK SHE'S\nGOING TO COME OUT REALLY STRONG AND CONDEMN THESE WORDS BY\nDONALD TRUMP. YOU KNOW, SHE HAS BEEN STANDING\nUP FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS FOR ALL OF HER ADULT LIFE.\nSHE'S BEEN TRAVELING GLOBALLY, INTERNATIONALLY, DOMESTICALLY,\nFIGHTING AND ADVOCATING FOR WOMEN TO BE EQUAL.\nSOCIALLY, ECONOMICALLY AND POLITICALLY.\nSHE'S GOING TO GO OUT THERE AND I BELIEVE SHE IS GOING TO\nCONDEMN HIM THE WAY NO ONE HAS OF YET.\n>> THE WAY NO ONE HAS AS OF YET. I HAVE TO GET A BREAK IN HERE.\nTHANK YOU VERY MUCH. COMING UP, HILLARY CLINTON AS WE\nJUST SPOKE ABOUT WILL FACE OFF TOMORROW NIGHT AGAINST DONALD\nTRUMP IN THE SECOND PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE.\nIT'S POSTED CO-MODERATED BY ANDERSON COOPER.\nIT'S AT 9:00 P.M. EASTERN HERE ON CNN.\nQUICK BREAK, WE'RE BACK IN A MOMENT.  MOMS KNOW THEIR KIDS NEED LOVE,",

LOUIS, DONALD TRUMP JUST TWEETING.\nTHIS IS THE SECOND TIME WE WE HEARD FROM HIM SINCE A TAPE\nRECORDED APOLOGY LAST NIGHT. HE JUST TWEETED LAST NIGHT THE\nMEDIA AND ESTABLISHMENT WANT ME OUT OF THE RICE SO BADLY.\nI WILL NEVER LET MY SUPPORTERS DOWN, #MAGA, WHICH IS MAKE\nAMERICA GREAT AGAIN. I GOT A TWEET FROM HILLARY\nCLINTON'S CAMPAIGN, LET ME READ THIS TO YOU HERE.\nHILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN DECIDED SATURDAY, TODAY, THAT\nTHE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE WILL NOT RESPOND TO DONALD TRUMP'S CASUAL\nCOMMENTS ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULTS BEFORE TOMORROW'S DEBATE.\nSO WE'RE NOT GOING TO HEAR FROM HILLARY CLINTON IN RESPONSE\nUNTIL THE DEBATE TOMORROW NIGHT. THIS GOES ON TO SAY THAT THEY\nARE REPORTING CLINTON'S TOP AIDES MADE THIS DECISION AFTER\nWATCHING DOZENS OF REPUBLICANS RESCIND THEIR ENDORSEMENT AND\nFEEL THERE IS NO RUSH TO GET SOMETHING OUT TODAY T. CAMPAIGN\nFEELS IT IS OFFICIAL IF IT IS HER FIRST RESPONSE THAT COMES\nDURING THE DEBATE TOMORROW NIGHT EXPECTED TO DRAW MORE THAN 80\nMILLION PEOPLE. THE IDEA IS TO MAXIMIZE THE\nNUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT HEAR HILLARY CLINTON'S RESPONSE FROM\nHER FOR THE FIRST TIME TO DONALD TRUMP AND THIS 2005 TAPE.\nCLINTON IS CURRENTLY, WE ARE TOLD FROM THE COMPANY, HUNKERED\nDOWN WITH TOP AIDES AT HER FOURTH DAY OF DEBATE\nPREPARATIONS. THE HEADLINE OUT OF THAT, NO ONE\nWILL HEAR FROM HILLARY CLINTON RESPONDING TO DONALD TRUMP UNTIL\nYOU WATCH IT LIVE TOMORROW NIGHT ON THE DEBATE ON CNN HOSTED BY\nOUR OWN ANDERSON COOPER. WE WILL SEE MEDIA CORRESPONDENT,\nHOST OF RELIABLE SOURCE, BRIAN STELZER AND RONNIE CHEN\nCONTRIBUTOR AND FORMERLY WORKING WITH MITT ROMNEY WHO CAME OUT\nTODAY AND CONDEMNED ALL OF THIS. LET'S TALK FIRST ABOUT THE\nTWEET. WE'LL GET TO CLINTON'S RESPONSE.\nHE SAYS THIS IS THE ESTABLISHMENT MEDIA.\nIT'S YOUR FAULT YOU DON'T WANT ME IN THIS RACE.\n>> IT'S BEEN ALMOST 24 HOURS SINCE THIS WASHINGTON POST STORY\nCAME OUT. I WAS HONESTLY WAITING THIS WEEK\nFOR DONALD TRUMP. HE HAS WAGED AN ANTI-MEDIA\nCAMPAIGN SINCE HE ENTERED THE RACE.\nHE HAS EXPLOITED THE MEDIA WHILE RUNNING AN ANTI-MEDIA CAMPAIGN.\nI SUSPECT HE WOULD FEEL THERE WAS AN OVER REACTION BY THE\nMEDIA TO THIS STORY IN THE WASHINGTON POST AND TO ALL THE\nCOVERAGE SINCE. I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH A SENIOR\nEXECUTIVE AND A COMPETING TELEVISION NETWORK WHO SAID I\nDID NOT THINK THIS STORY WOULD BECOME AS BIG AS IT HAS.\nI THINK WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE THIS IS A SNOWBALL, AN AVALANCHE\nOF SORTS AS MORE AND MORE REPUBLICANS COME OUT AGAINST\nTRUMP. >> TRUMP IS ADDING TO IT WITH\nTHESE TWEETS, AN INTERESTING 24 HOURS IT'S BEEN AFTER VIDEOTAPE\nCAME, LET'S JUST REMIND OUR VIEWERS, THIS IS VIDEO TAIP TAPE\nOF HIM NOT JUST MAKING LEWD COMMENTS, MAKING PREDATORY\nCOMMENTS. YOU GOT A STUDENT OUT HERE, IT'S\nSEXUAL ASSAULT. WE GOT TO KEEP THAT MIND ASSAULT\nIN 3450I7BD, THE GRAVITY OF THE STORY.\n>> DONALD TRUMP SAYS IT'S THE MEDIA'S FAULT.\nHE SAYS IN THAT TWEET, IT IS THE ESTABLISHMENT'S FAULT.\nLET'S LOOK AT ALL OF THE QUOTE/UNQUOTE ESTABLISHMENT HE\nIS TALKING ABOUT WHO HAVE PULLED AWAY AND WILL NOT SUPPORT DONALD\nTRUMP. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT DEMOCRATS.\nI'M TALKING ABOUT REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS.\nREPUBLICAN SENATORS, WHO ARE SAYING I CAN NO LONGER STAND BY\nTHE MAN. ONE IS AN ABERRATION, TWO IS A\nTREND. THIS IS SNOWBALL EFFECT.\nTHE REASON WHY, FRANKLY, POLITICS.\n>> YOU HAVE PEOPLE LIKE JOANIE AHRENS UP THERE, SOMEBODY\nFLOATED AS A POSSIBLE RUNNING MATE FOR TRUMP.\nSHE ISSUED A STATEMENT A FEW HOURS AGO STAYING THESE COMMENTS\nARE LEWD, I CANNOT STAND BY THIS.\n>> THERE ARE TWO ISSUES, ONE FOR PEOPLE RUNNING IN THIS AS YOU\nCANLE. TRUMP IS A LED WEIGHT.\nTHE SECOND ISSUE IS A LONGER TERM QUESTION, WHAT DOES THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY STAND FOR? WHAT KIND OF A PARTY ARE WE\nGOING TO BE? THIS IS A TIME OF CHOOSING FOR\nREPUBLICANS. THESE REPUBLICAN VERSUS MADE THE\nCHOICE THAT I BELIEVE IS THE RIGHT CHOICE.\n>> LET ME ADD ONE CAVEAT. THERE IS A MEDIA ELITE REACTION,\nA REPUBLICAN PARTY ELITE REACTION.\nWHAT WE DON'T KNOW IS HOW VOTERS ARE REACTING TO THIS.\n>> I THINK IT'S SUCH AN IMPORTANT POINT IT'S ONE THING\nFOR THE PUNDITS TO SAY THEY THINK AND THE MEDIA, BUT JASON\nCARROLL WAS WITH A BUNCH OF VOTERS, AND THEY'RE HEARING A\nLOT OF SUPPORT FOR TRUMP FROM THE VOTERS.\n>> WE NEED TO KEEP THAT IN MIND. I WAS WORRIED LAST NIGHT SITTING\nON THE SET WITH DONE LEMON THINKING IS THERE OVER REACTION\nBY THE MEDIA? I DON'T BELIEVE THERE HAS BEEN.\nTHIS VIDEO WHAT'S REPULSIVE. I'M GLAD THE TELEVISION NETWORKS\nPLAYED IT IN FULL, PLAYED THE VULGAR WORDS AND MADE SURE\nPEOPLE WE HEARD IT. WHAT WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE IS\nHOW VOTERS WHO HAVE BACKED THIS MAN FOR OVER A YEAR AND BELIEVE\nHE IS THE ONLY REACTION TO THEIR PROBLEMS, HOW THEY'RE REACTING.\n>> WE ARE STILL WAITING TO HEAR FROM PAUL RYAN AT THIS ELK HORN,\nWISCONSIN EVENT. THIS WAS A HUGE DEAL HE\nDISINVITED TRUMP, TO THIS EVENT. SCOTT WALKER IS SPEAKING THERE\nLIVE, MIKE PENCE WON'T EVEN GO NOW, LONNIE.\n>> YEAH, WELL, PAUL RYAN IS THE INTELLECTUAL LEADER OF THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY. IN SOME WAYS, HE REPRESENTS THE\nFUTURE OF THE PARTY. PEOPLE LIKE HIM AND MARCO RUBIO\nDO. IT'S IMPORTANT TO WATCH WHAT HE\nDOES AND TO NOT APPEAR WITH TRUMP IS ONE THING.\nI THINK THE QUESTION, IS IT GOING TO BE SUSTAINABLE FOR PAUL\nRYAN AND OTHERS TO SAY, WE BELIEVE WHAT HE SAYS IS\nREPULSIVE, WE STILL WANT HIM TO BE PRESIDENT.\nIT'S A DIFFICULT POSITION TO BE IN.\n>> HE SAID HE WILL NEVER LET THE VOTERS DOWN.\n31 DAY, TRUMP WILL WIN OR LOSE IN 31 DAYS.\nTHIS DOES END AT SOME POINT. EVEN THOUGH HE'S TALKED ABOUT\nELECTION AND A STOLEN ELECTION, THIS DOES END.\nTHIS INSANE ELECTION WILL END SOON AND TRUMP HAS TO BE\nTHINKING ABOUT THAT AS WELL. IT'S NOT JUST MIKE PENCE THAT'S\nTHINKING OF 2020. >> STAY WITH ME.\nWE ARE WAITING FOR PAUL RYAN. WILL HE PULL HIS ENDORSEm FROM\nTRUMP? WE WILL BRING YOU THAT LIVE.\nIN ST. LOUIS AHEAD OF THE DEBATE.\nWE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.",

LOUIS, AHEAD OF THE NEXT\nPRESIDENTIAL DEBATE HERE TOMORROW NIGHT.\nJILL BIDEN THE VICE PRESIDENT TWEETING THIS ABOUT DONALD\nTRUMP'S TAPE. THE WORDS ARE DEMEANING.\nSUCH BEHAVIOR IS AN ABUSE OF POWER.\nIT IS NOT LEWD. IT'S SEXUAL ASSAULT, THAT COMING\nFROM THE VICE PRESIDENT. MEANTIME, ON CNN WE HAVE LEARNED\nTHAT DONALD TRUMP AT THIS MOMENT IS STILL DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT\nHE WILL ADDRESS THE PUBLIC. WHETHER OR NOT HE WILL MAKE A\nSPEECH TONIGHT REGARDING THE FALLOUT FROM THAT 2005 VIDEOTAPE\nWHERE HE MADE THOSE SEXUALLY EXPLICIT AND AGGRESSIVE COMMENTS\nABOUT GRABBING WOMEN'S GENITALS. SOME REPUBLICANS ARE NOW CALLING\nFOR TRUMP TO BE REPLACED AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET BY HIS RUNNING\nMATE, MIKE PENCE. IS THAT POSSIBLE?\nESPECIALLY 31 DAYS OUT FROM THE GENERAL ELECTION?\nONE OF OUR REPORTERS ON CNN POLITICS.COM AND COMMENTATOR AND\nPOLITICAL RNC CHIEF OF STAFF MIKE SHIELDS.\nGENTLEMAN, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.\nTOM, LET'S DIVE INTO THE SCENARIOS HERE.\nIT'S ALL ABOUT SOMETHING CALLED RULE 9.\nRIGHT. BUT IN ORDER FOR RULE 9 TO TAKE\nEFFECT, DONALD TRUMP HAS TO VOLUNTARILY DROP OUT.\nHE HAS SAID TIME AND TIME AGAIN, INCLUDING A TWEET WITHIN THE\nLAST HOUR, THERE IS NO WAY HE IS GOING TO DO THAT.\nHOW WOULD THIS WORK? >> WELL, IF HE DID DROP OUT.\nLIKE YOU SAID, HE MADE IT VERY CLEAR, THAT'S NOT GOING TO\nHAPPEN. IF IT WERE, THEN IT WOULD GO TO\nTHE REPUBLICAN PARTY THE RNC, THEY SET THE RULES THAT GOT THEM\nINTO THIS NOMINEE IN THE FIRST PLACE TO DECIDE WHO TO REPLACE\nHIM WITH. IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THAT'S\nGOING TO HAPPEN. THERE HAS BEEN A DIFFERENT THING\nTHAT'S BEEN THROWN OUT BY ELECTION EXPERTS, CALLED THE\nFAITHFUL SELECTOR. THAT'S WHERE WE GET TO MIKE\nPENCE, THIS IDEA THAT MAYBE THEY CAST THEIR BALLOT.\nTHEY SAY THEY WILL CAST THEIR BALLOT FOR TRUMP, WHEN IN\nREALITY, THEY WILL CAST THEIR BALLOT FOR MIKE PENCE.\nTHIS IS KIND OF THE HAIL MARY THAT'S OUT THERE IN LEW OF RULE\n9 RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE YOU KNOW, WE SAW THAT\nALL CAPS TWEET FROM DONALD TRUMP.\nHE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE. >> EXACTLY.\nAND AS WE TALK, LET'S BRING THAT TWEET UP FOR OUR VIEWERS.\nLET ME REMIND YOU GUYS OF WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAID IN THE LAST\nHOUR. THE MEDIA AND THE ESTABLISHMENT\nWANT ME OUT OF THE RACE SO BADLY.\nI WILL NEVER DROP OUT OF THE RACE.\nI WILL NEVER LET MY SUPPORTERS DOWN, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.\nCAN WE TALK MORE ABOUT THIS SCENARIO, HOW THAT WILL WORK\nGOING TO THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE AND THEY'VE BASICALLY, IF THERE\nIS ANY POSSIBLY OF THAT HAPPENING?\n>> Reporter: YEAH, I THINK THAT'S EXTREMELY UNLIKELY TO BE\nHONEST WITH YOU. DONALD TRUMP IS ON THE BALLOT.\nBALLOTS ARE BEING PRINTED. IN TERMS OF GETTING THEM OFF OF\nTHE BALLOT, A LOT IS UNDER A STATE LAW ISSUE.\nALL 50 STATES HAVE THEIR OWN ELECTION LAWS.\nSO YOU HAVE TO GO STATE BY STATE BY STATE IF YOU WILL ADJUST THE\nBALLOT. PEOPLE IN IOWA HAVE BEEN VOTING\nSINCE SEPTEMBER. PEOPLE IN COLORADO ARE GETTING\nREADY TO VOTE IN BATTLEGROUND STATES, FLORIDA, ARIZONA HAS A\nLOT OF EARLY VOTES. THERE'S A REAL LOGISTICAL ISSUE\nIF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE NAMES ON THE BALLOT BEFORE THE\nELECTION. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT.\nIT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE. IT'S BEEN DONE BEFORE, UNDER\nMcGOVERN, THERE WAS AN ISSUE THERE, PEOPLE LATE GOT IN AND\nCHANGE IT. THAT'S UP TO THE PEOPLE TO RULE\nIN THEIR STATE. FOR THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE, I\nTHINK THAT IS SO FAR GONE FROM REALITY.\nI'M NOT SURE HOW YOU WOULD START A CAMPAIGN TO GO AND CAMPAIGN TO\nTHE ELECTORS TO MAKE THEM INTO FACELESS ELECTORS SO THAT WHEN\nTHEY GO TO THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE THEY SWITCH THEIR VOTE.\n>> RIGHT. AS PRESIDENT, THE PRESIDENT\nVOTED YESTERDAY, PRESIDENT OBAMA VOTED YESTERDAY AND, TOM,\nCORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG. YOU WOULD THEN HAVE TO LITERALLY\nNEGOTIATE WITH 50 STATES ATTORNEY GEM.\n>> YES. IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE\nLEAST. >> YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS\nTHAT'S VERY INTERESTING REMEMBER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PROCESS\nTHE RULES. UP WITH OF THE THINGS\nFASCINATING ABOUT THIS, THIS WAS DISCUSSED IN AUGUST.\nTHE LAST TIME WE HAD A DISASTROUS TRUMP BLOWUP WITH\nKEISER KHAN. WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS YOU\nHAVE ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS TALKING ABOUT THIS.\nTHIS IS THE POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS IS MORE, I\nWANT TO SAY SERIOUS BUT MORE ESTABLISHMENT TIMES.\nTHE PEOPLE WHO HAD GOTTEN ON BOARD WITH TRUMP, NOW LOOKING AT\nWHAT ARE OUR OPTIONS? THE REALITY IS IT'S SO LATE IN\nTHE GAME AT THIS POINT, THAT THERE AREN'T ANY OPTIONS.\n>> YOU KNOW, MIKE, I THINK IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE ONE OF THE\nTHINGS MY PANEL WAS TALKING ABOUT IS SORT OF THE BACK ROOM\nDISCUSSION AND NEGOTIATIONS THAT ARE GOING ON RIGHT NOW, PAUL\nRYAN CAME OUT. HE DIDN'T ADDRESS IT.\nHE SAYS THERE'S AN ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM.\nI PUT OUT A STATEMENT. THAT I STAND BY THAT MOVING ON.\nBECAUSE A BIG ISSUE HERE COMES DOWN TO FUNDING AND FUNDRAISING\nAND DOWN BALLOT, RIGHT? SO IF THE PARTY STEPS AWAY FROM\nTRUMP, WHAT DOES THAT DO TO THEM DOWN BALLOT?\n>> A FEW THINGS, FIRST OF ALL, WE ALL WANT A SNAP REACTION.\nWE WANT THE SPEAKER AND THE MAJORITY LEADER OF THE SENATE.\nIT'S BEEN RIGHT",

LOUIS, THE\nSITE OF THE SECOND PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE TAKING PLACE HERE\nTOMORROW NIGHT HOSTED BY OUR VERY OWN ANDERSON COOPER.\nHE WILL BE MODERATING. JUST BREAKING NEWS FROM DANA\nBASH. HERE'S WHAT SHE'S REPORTING AT\nTHIS MOMENT, MIKE PENCE TOLD DONALD TRUMP IN A CALL TODAY\nTHAT THE ONLY EFFECTIVE PERSON TO SPEAK ON THIS ISSUE, THIS\nSCANDAL IS DONALD TRUMP, HIMSELF, MIKE PENCE ALSO SAID IF\nHE WENT TO WISCONSIN TO BE ON STAGE WITH PAUL RYAN, WHICH HE\nWAS PLANNING TO, BUT PULLED THAT OUT THAT THAT WOULD INTERFERE\nWITH THAT, ACCORDING TO A SOURCE FAMILIAR WITH THAT CALL.\nADEN, DA THAT REPORTING MIKE PENCE TOLD DONALD TRUMP ON THE\nPHONE TODAY, THE ONLY EFFECTIVE PERSON TO SPEAK ABOUT THIS IS\nYOU, DONALD TRUMP. MEANTIME, DONALD TRUMP'S WIFE,\nMELANIA, IS RESPONDING TO THE NEWLY RELEASED VIDEO OF HER\nHUSBAND. SHE SAYS, QUOTE THE WORDS MY\nHUSBAND USED ARE UNACCEPTABLE AND OFFENSIVE TO ME.\nTHIS DOES NOT REPRESENT THE MAN THAT I KNOW.\nHE HAS THE HEART AND MIND OF A LEADER.\nI HOPE PEOPLE WILL ACCEPT HIS APOLOGY AS I HAVE, AND FOCUS ON\nTHE IMPORTANT ISSUES FACING OUR NATION AND THE WORLD.\nMEANTIME, DONALD TRUMP'S DAUGHTER IVAN KA TRUMPED A HER\nHUSBAND WERE AT TRUMP TOWER MEETING WITH DONALD TRUMP,\nDISCUSSING TWA HIS RESPONSE WILL BE TO THAT LEAKED VIDEO.\nLAST FALL, I SAT DOWN WITH IVANKA TRUMP, WE FOCUSED ON HER\nCAMPAIGN, \"WOMEN WHO WORK.\" I ASKED HER ABOUT HER FATHER'S\nTREATMENT OF WOMEN. HERE'S PART OF THAT INTERVIEW.\n>> YOUR FATHER POINTS TO YOU TELLING HIM, THAT HE HAS BEEN ON\nTHE CAMPAIGN TRAIL WAS REALLY MISUNDERSTOOD ON HIS VIEWS ABOUT\nWOMEN. HE HAS SAID SOME THINGS ABOUT\nWOMEN THAT HAVE SHOCKED MANY PEOPLE, ABOUT CARLEY FIORINA,\nLOOK AT THAT FACE, WOULD ANYONE VOTE FOR THAT, ABOUT MEGYN\nKELLY'S QUESTIONING HIM IN THE FOX DEBATE, THERE WAS BLOOD\nCOMING OUT OF WHEREVER. WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION TO THAT?\n>> I THINK A LOT OF THE SENSATIONALISM AROUND THIS WAS\nORCHESTRATED LARGELY BY THE MEDIA.\nMY FATHER IS VERY BLUNT. HE IS VERY DIRECT.\nHE IS NON-GENDER SPECIFIC ABOUT PEOPLE THAT HE DOESN'T\nPARTICULARLY LIKE OR PEOPLE HE DOESN'T LIKE AND THINKS THEY'RE\nWRONG ON A PARTICULAR ISSUE. SO I DON'T THINK THAT HE'S\nGENDER TARGETED AT ALL. LIKE I SAID, I WOULDN'T BE THE\nPERSON I AM TODAY. I WOULDN'T BE A HIGH LEVEL\nEXECUTIVE WITHIN HIS ORGANIZATION IF HE FELT THAT\nWAY. SO HE'S ALWAYS SUPPORTED AND\nENCOURAGED WOMEN AND TRUTHFULLY HE'S PROVEN THAT OVER DECADES,\nTHROUGH LISS EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES, THROUGH HIS HIRING\nPRACTICES. >> WHAT WOULD A PRESIDENT TRUMP\nDO FOR WOMEN IN THIS COUNTRY? >> HE'D BE AMAZING FOR WOMEN IN\nTHIS COUNTRY. HE WOULD BE INCREDIBLE FOR WOMEN\nIN THIS COUNTRY AND HE'S STARTING TO ARTICULATE HIS\nPOSITIONS. IT'S NOT MY PLACE TO ARTICULATE\nTHIS FOR HIM. I'M NOT PART OF THE CAMPAIGN.\nI'M VERY BUSY AND HE'S KEPT ME VERY BUSY WORKING ALONGSIDE MY\nBROTHERS AND RUNNING THE ORGANIZATION NOW THAT HE'S TAKE\nTHIS STEP AND IN TERMS OF HIS EFFORTS TO TRY AND MAKE THIS\nCOUNTRY GREAT AGAIN, AS HE SAYS, SO, YOU KNOW, I'LL LEAVE POLICY\nTO HIM, BUT I CAN SPEAK FROM MY VANTAGE POINT AS A CHILD AND\nALSO FROM MY VAN TAGE POINT AS A COLLEAGUE AND SOMEBODY WHO WORKS\nFOR HIM. HE'S BEEN AN AMAZING PARENT.\nHE'S GIVEN ME EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED.\nHE'S BEEN LOVING AND SUPPORTIVE. HE'S PUSHED ME.\nHE'S CORRECTED ME, HE'S DISCIPLINED ME.\nAND I THINK AS A PARENT NOW MYSELF, I APPRECIATE HOW HARD\nTHAT IS MORE THAN EVER BEFORE. WHEN I WAS 15 OR 16, I WAS A\nLITTLE LESS IMPRESSED BY HOW TOUGH HE WAS AND HOW STRICT HE\nWAS WITH US AS CHILDREN. AS A PARENT NOW, I SEE JUST HOW\nHARD IT IS TO RAISE CHILDREN",

SHELBY HOLIDAY AND TONY\nREPUBLICAN POLITICAL STRATEGIST. GOOD TO SEE EVERYBODY.\nTHANK YOU FOR JOINING US. YOU ARE STILL ON THAT SUPERPACK.\nA LOT OF COLLEAGUES IN THE GOP ARE WALKING AWAY FROM DONALD\nTRUMP. >> I OPERATED ON THE FACT THAT\nIN THESE BATTLES IT IS LIKE BEING IN THE ALAMO.\nTHERE IS NO BACK DOOR. DONALD TRUMP EARNED THE\nNOMINATION AND HAS TO TRY TO GET PEOPLE TO THE GAME.\nHE HAS TO ADD VOTERS EVERY DAY AND NOT LOSE VOTERS.\n>> CAN HE SURVIVE THIS? >> TONIGHT IS A HUGE NIGHT FOR\nHIM. I CAN'T EMPHASIZE HOW MUCH IS\nRIDING ON THE DEBATE. HE HAS TO PROVE HE IS A CHANGE\nAGENT AS WELL AS CHANGED MAN. HE NEEDS TO DEFLECT AND ATTACK\nHILLARY CLINTON. HILLARY CLINTON IS DEALING WITH\nSOME OF HER OWN FALLOUT. IF HE CANNOT EMPHASIZE THAT IT\nMAY BE OVER. >> I THINK IT IS A GOOD POINT.\nTHAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS HE SAID IN THAT APOLOGIZE.\nMET A LOT OF PEOPLE OVER THE LAST YEAR.\nI HEARD THEM. I CHANGED.\nDO WE BELIEVE IT? >> AND THESE COMMENTS WERE MADE\n11 YEARS AGO AT A DIFFERENT TIME IN DONALD TRUMP'S LIFE WITH\nDIFFERENT PRIORITIES. HE WAS MUCH MORE OF AN\nENTERTAINMENT CELEBRITY. EVERY PERSON HAS A CHANCE TO\nEVOLVE. LET'S REMEMBER SOMETHING ELSE.\nI WOULD SUGGEST TAKING A PAGE OUT OF THE BILL CLINTON PLAY\nBOOK IN 1992 WHEN HE WAS BARRAGED BY A LOT OF SCANDAL\nRELATED TO SEXUAL INNUINDO. BILL CLINTON JUST CHARGED ON.\nHE CAMPAIGNED FOR EVERY VOTE, WORKED REALLY HARD AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENED.\nTHE AMERICAN ELECTORATE HAS AN INTERESTING ASPECT.\nWE ARE BIG BELIEVERS IN REDEMPTION AND CONTRITION.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS TO BE CANDID AND CONTRITE.\nIF HE DOESN'T DO THAT IT WILL BE HARD TO PULL OFF.\n>> ONE IMPORTANT THING. IF HE HADN'T GONE AFTER MISS\nUNIVERSE AFTER THE LAST DEBATE WHICH DID SEVERE DAMAGE IT JUST\nADDS UP. FROM HERE ON HIS THING HAS TO BE\nTO HAVE HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER BY HIS SIDE AND TALKING ABOUT\nISSUES THAT MATTER TO WOMEN. WOMEN ARE THE KEY TO THE\nELECTION RIGHT NOW. >> HE GOES INTO THE DEBATE ON\nDEFENSE. AND THAT FIRST DEBATE THAT IS\nWHAT THE PROBLEM WAS. AS SOON AS HE WALKED OUT HE WAS\nON DEFENSE. ONCE AGAIN HE FINDS HIMSELF\nEXPLAINING. I'M NOT SURPRISED THAT DONALD\nTRUMP MIGHT MAKE A LEWD COMMENT IN PRIVATE.\nHE HAS SHOWN US WHO HE IS AND SAYS WHAT IS ON HIS MIND.\nMAYBE HE HAS CHANGED IN THAT REGARD.\nHE IS STILL GOING TO BE EXPLAINING RATHER THAN\nCOMMUNICATING HIS MESSAGE. >> HE HAS TO GO FROM BEING AN\nENTERTAINER WHICH IS WHAT HE HAS BEEN TO BEING A REAL LEADER WHO\nIS ADVOCATING A CHANGE POLICY IN WASHINGTON.\n>> THERE IS A KEY BLOCK OF THE REPUBLICAN BASE THAT IS\nEXTREMELY ENTHUIASTIC ABOUT VOTING FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nTHEY WILL NOT GO ANYWHERE AFTER THESE COMMENTS BUT THEY ARE\nTHESE VOTERS WHO HAVE DECIDED THEY WILL HOLD THEIR NOSE AND\nVOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP.

THAT DISLIKED THAT ACTUALLY --\n>> THERE IS A BELIEF THAT SHE IS FUNDAMENTALLY CORRUPT AND\nDISHONEST AND PEOPLE AREN'T EXCITED ABOUT THE ALTERNATIVE.\nTWO IMPORTANT THINGS TO REMEMBER.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS TO TURN THIS CONVERSATION INTO I MAY HAVE\nSAID CERTAIN THINGS. SHE HAS DONE CERTAIN THINGS AND\nPOINT OUT THE FOUNDATION, THAT IS THE IMPORTANT PIVOT.\nTHIS REVELATION DOES NOT CHANGE MACRODYNAMIC.\nHE IS STRONGEST WHEN TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMY, JOBS, TRADE,\nIMMIGRATION. IF HE CAN PIVOT HE CAN WIN BACK\nA LOT OF THAT. >> I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT\nAFTER THIS BREAK BECAUSE IT IS VERY SOON NOW LOOKING LIKE A\nCAMPAIGN OF WHAT HE SAID VERSUS WHAT SHE DID, MORE FROM THE\nPANEL RIGHT AFTER THIS SHORT BREAK.",

I BELIEVE GUYS, WE HAVE MJ\nTHERE? WE ARE TRYING TO GET, MJ LEE,\nOUR REPORTER OUTSIDE TRUMP TOWER, WHAT ARE YOU HEARING?\nWHAT ARE THE PEOPLE SAYING? I HEAR THEM CHANTING USA!\nWHAT ELSE? >> Reporter: WELL, POPPY, THAT\nWAS CERTAINLY UNEXPECTED. WE WERE NOT EXPECTING TO SEE\nDONALD TRUMP COME OUT OF TRUMP TOWER.\nI DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE, BUT HE CAME OUT AND STOOD ON THE\nSIDEWALK OUTSIDE OF TRUMP TOWER AND WAVED TO HIS SUPPORTERS,\nGAVE THEM A BIG SMILE. CLEARLY A CANDIDATE THAT WANTED\nTO SORT OF LEVEL IN THE FACT THAT THERE ARE DOZENS AND DOZENS\nOF SUPPORTERS THAT ARE OUTSIDE, SHOWING THEIR SUPPORT.\nRIGHT NOW, WE ARE HEARING THE REPORTERS CHANTING, MR. TRUMP,\nMR. TRUMP, OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THE SUPPORTERS HAVE BEEN OUT\nHERE FOR SEVERAL HOURS NOW, REALLY TRYING TO SHOW THEIR\nSUPPORT FOR DONALD TRUMP AND THEY'RE REQUESTING THE MEDIA AS\nWELL. A LOT OF THE REPORTERS HAVE BEEN\nYELLING OUT HERE FOR MANY HOURS TODAY, SAYING THAT WE SHOULD\nREALLY NOT BE FOCUSING ON THE VIDEO THAT CAME OUT YESTERDAY\nAND THAT WE WERE REALLY DOING A DISSERVICE AND WE SHOULD BE\nCOVERING SOME OF THE RESO RESOLUTIONS.\nJ. STAY WITH ME.\nI HAVE A STATEMENT IN, DONALD TRUMP CRIT SIDED, SAID JOHN\nMcCAIN WAS NOT A WAR HERO. HE WAS WITHDRAWING HIS SUPPORT\nOF DONALD TRUMP. I WILL READ YOU THIS STATEMENT\nIN FULL. PARE WITH ME.\n96 TO MY WELL-KNOWN DITCHES WITH DONALD TRUMP ON PUBLIC POLICY\nISSUES, I HAVE RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS CHARACTER AFTER THE\nKHAN GOLD STAR FAMILY AND EARLIER INAPPROPRIATE COMMENTS\nABOUT WOMEN. JUST THIS WEEK, HE MADE\nSTATEMENTS ABOUT INNOCENT MEN. AS I SAY, THERE ARE NO EXCUSES\nFOR DONALD TRUMP'S DEMEANING COMMENTS, NO WOMAN SHOULD EVER\nBE VICTIMIZE BY THIS KIND OF INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR.\nTHIS AGAIN IS A STATEMENT FROM JOHN McCAIN.\nHE GOES ON TO SAY HE, TRUMP ALONE, BEARS THE BURDEN OF HIS\nCONDUCT AND ALONE SHOULD SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES.\nTHAT'S A PART OF THE STATEMENT FROM JOHN McCAIN AS YOU ARE ALSO\nLOOKING AT THESE IMAGES OF DONALD TRUMP COMING OUTSIDE OF\nTRUMP TOWER FOR THE FIRST TIME. LET ME BRING IN MY PANEL WITH ME\nAGAIN, DAVID GERGEN, AND MARK PRESTON, GUYS, I WAS IN THE\nMIDDLE OF READING THAT JOHN McCAIN STATEMENT.\nYOUR REACTION TO DONALD TRUMP WALKING OUT PUBLICLY FOR THE\nFIRST TIME AFTER HUDDLING HOURS ON END WITH HIS TEAM, WILL HE\nADDRESS THE PUBLIC TONIGHT? STILL AN UNKNOWN.\n>> THIS IS FASCINATING SAGA, DRAMA.\n>> HE DIDN'T HAVE TO WALK OUTDOORS?\n>> HE CLEARLY WANTED TO. THEY SET THAT UP.\nIT'S A SMART MOVE. WHAT WE ARE SHAPING UP IS A\nBATTLE OF THE PEOPLE VERSUS THE ELITE THE ESTABLISHMENT.\n>> FRANKLY, THE STORY THIS ELECTION?\nIN THERE THE STORY THIS ELECTION, HE BROUGHT IT TO A\nHEAD NOW. HE HAS SHOWN NOT ONLY HERE, THE\nPAUL RYAN RALLY, UNEXPECTEDLY, HE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE,\nSAYING, WHERE'S TRUMP? SO YOU KNOW, WE'RE WATCHING, YOU\nKNOW, ONE OF THE POLITICAL DRAMAS OF OUR TIME.\nI DON'T THINK ANY OF US HAVE EVER SEEN THIS, FRANKLY, I HOPE\nWE NEVER SEE IT AGAIN, NONETHELESS.\n>> I WAS STRUCK IN THIS MOMENT THE WILLIE NILINESS, THE GOP\nNOMINEE, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, UP AGAINST THE WALL, REVOLT WITH\nMANY IN HIS PARTY, FEELING THE NEED TO COME OUT OF TRUMP TOWER\nWHERE HE HAS HOLED UP ALL DAY TO GIVE A THUMBS UP.\nI WAS STRUCK WITH HIS FIST IN THE AIR.\nWE CAN DO THIS. HE WANTS THAT IMAGE IN THE\nMIDDLE OF THIS AWFUL NEWS DAY FOR HIM.\nTHIS AWFUL 24 HOURS. HE WANTS THAT IMAGE, SHOWING HE\nHAS SUPPORTERS, OUT THERE CHANTING HIS NAME SAYING, GO,\nGO, GO! USA.\nTHIS IS A PART OF THE DAMAGE, IT'S A SYMBOLIC MOVE, RIGHT,\nJUST THE BODY LANGUAGE THAT HE CONVEYED THERE, OBVIOUSLY, HE\nCOULD GO OUT THE BACK, OUT THE GARAGE, HE WENT OUT THE FRONT\nDOORS ON FIFTH AVENUE IN THE MIDDLE OF MANHATTAN ON A\nSATURDAY AFTERNOON, MARK PRESTON, THIS IS NOT ONLY DAVID\nGERGEN, SORT OF THE ESTABLISHMENT POLITICS VERSUS\nTRUMP OR THE PEOPLE VERSUS THE ESTABLISHMENT.\nTHIS IS ALSO TRUMP VERSUS HIS OWN TEAM IN A SENSE.\nBECAUSE NOT SURE THEY WOULD HAVE ADVISED HIM TO WALK OUT THE\nDOOR. BY THE WAY, HIS ADVISERS TOLD\nHIM, DON'T BRING, ACCORDING TO MAGGIE HAVEERMAN OF THE \"NEW\nYORK TIMES,\" HE DID IT ANYWAY. >> WE KNOW FROM OUR REPORTER\nWITH HILLARY CLINTON THAT BILL CLINTON WILL BE HERE TOMORROW\nNIGHT. WHETHER OR NOT HE'S IN THE HALL\nOR DECIDES TO WATCH IT IN A HOLD ROOM, WE'LL WAIT AND SEE.\n>> THAT IMAGE WAS FRIGHTENING. IT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS THE END,\nRIGHT? IT'S A TIME WHEN A DICTATOR DOWN\nIN CENTRAL AMERICA COMES OUT AND RAISES HIS HAND, LIKE I'M IN IT,\nI'M NOT GETTING OUT, RIGHT, GUESS WHAT, IT'S OVER.\nIT IS OVER FOR HIM. YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT HOW THIS\nIS A BAD NEWS DAY, A TERRIBLE NEWS DAY, IT'S A BAD TIME FOR\nAMERICA. THIS IS AN AWFUL CHAPTER IN THE\nHISTORY OF AMERICA. THIS IS AN AWFUL CHAPTER IN THE\nHISTORY OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST CHAPTER\nIN DONALD TRUMP'S LIFE. I JUST THINK THAT WHEN WE TAKE A\nSTEP BACK AND LOOK WHERE WE ARE AND WHERE ARE WE GOING, IT\nREALLY IS SYMBOLIC OF THIS DIVIDED AMERICA AND THE ANGER\nTOWARDS WASHINGTON AND IT'S ALL --\n>> IT'S SUCH AN IMPORTANT POINT, BECAUSE YOU GOT THE TWO\nCANDIDATES, THE MOST FAMOUS CANDIDATES ARGUABLY EVER WITH\nTHE HIGHEST UNFAVORABLES EVER, LIKE 70% OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO\nSEE A THIRD PARTY CANDIDATE BE ABLE TO VOTE FOR THEM AND SHOW\nSOME SORT OF SUPPORT. DAVID GERGEN, TO YOU, AT THE\nSAME TIME, I JUST WONDER, IF THAT'S WHERE TRUMP IS HEADED ON?\nMARK PRESTON SAYS THIS IS THE EN.\nTRUMP SAYS I WILL NEVER GET OUT. I AM IN THIS TO THE END.\n>> I THINK IN HIS HEAD, HE CAN RALLY.\nHE CAN TURN THIS AROUND. HE REMINDS ME VERY MUCH OF NIXON\nIN THE CLOSING MONTHS. HE LOVED THESE KIND OF HARD HAT\nRESPONSES. HE COULD GET THAT STILL, EVEN AS\nTHINGS WERE CLOSING IN ON HIM. THE DIFFERENCE HERE IS THAT THE\nREPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE DOESN'T HAVE THE POWER TO REMOVE\nTRUMP AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET. SO HE CAN TAKE IT ALL THE WAY\nTHROUGH THE ELECTION. >> I SAY IT'S THE END OF HIS\nCANDIDACY IN THE SENSE THERE IS NO POSSIBLE WAY HE CAN WIN THE\nPRESIDENCY. I THINK DAVID IS RIGHT.\nHE, HE'S GOT SO MUCH EGO AT STAKE IN HIMSELF HE DOESN'T WANT\nTO STEP ASIDE. >> WHAT IS INTERESTING, A\nHILLARY CLINTON SUPPORTER SAID TO ME EARLIER TODAY, IF, INDEED,\nHE DOES NOT WIN AND SHE DOES WIN, SHE SAYS, IS THIS HOW YOU\nWANT TO WIN? >> NO ONE GUESSED WE WOULD HAVE\nBEEN HERE RIGHT NOW. I THINK FOR HILLARY CLINTON, A\nWIN IS A WIN. IF SHE DOES GO ON TO WIN, BUT\nNOTHING THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS SHOWN IN HIS CHARACTER, LEADING\nUP TO NOW, NOR NOTHING HE HAS SAID IN THE LAST 24 HOURS,\nINDICATE HE IS GOING TO TRY TO GIVE AN INCH.\nI DO THINK HE DOES POTENTIALLY OPERATE WELL WHEN HE FEELS A\nLITTLE LIKE THE UNDERDOG, A DELEGATE, UP AGAINST THE WALL, I\nTHINK THAT'S THE POSITION FOR HIM TO BE IN.\n>> I THINK THIS COULD BE A WINFALL FOR HILLARY.\nSHE CAN GO AND WIN BIG NOW. >> THAT WOULD REALLY HELP HER\nWITH THE GOVERNOR. >> MJ LEE WITH US BACK OUTSIDE\nTRUMP TOWER. MJ, I CAN HEAR FROM THIS.\nYOU CAN HEAR A LOT BETTER BEING THERE, A LOT OF SUPPORTERS\nTHERE. >> Reporter: A TON OF\nSUPPORTERS. ACTUALLY MIND MIBEHIND ME, A TO\nOF SUPPORTERS ON FIFTH AVENUE. THEY ARE CHANTING TO SHOW THEIR\nSUPPORT. I FELT THAT WAS CHARACTERISTIC\nOF DONALD TRUMP TO IN THE MIDDLE OF A DAY LIKE THIS, WHEN THE\nENTIRE CAMPAIGN IS IN FULL CRISIS MODE, DONALD TRUMP\nDECIDED TO MAKE AN APPEARANCE AND SHOW HIS SUPPORTERS THAT HE\nKNOWS THAT THEY ARE HERE AND THAT THEY HAVE BEEN CAMPED OUT\nALL DAY. WE SAW HIM COME OUT, A BIG SMILE\nON HIS FACE AND WAVE. MY COLLEAGUE JEREMY DIAMOND\nYELLED OUT A QUESTION, RATHER, TO HIM, ASKING IS HE GOING TO\nSTAY IN THE RACE? DONALD TRUMP ESSENTIALLY SAID,\nYES, HE IS NOT GETTING OUT. >> OKAY.\nMJ LEE, GREAT REPORTING FROM TRUMP TOWER.\nWE'RE GOING TO GET A QUICK BREAK IN.\nI WANT TO THANK MY PANEL, ALSO SUNLAND, DAVID, J AND MARK.\nBEFORE WE GO TO BREAK, TO BUTTON THIS UP, I WAS READING JOHN\nMcCAIN'S STATEMENT EARLIER. THIS IS A STATEMENT FROM THE\n2008 REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.\nLET ME READ THE END OF IT FOR YOU.\nCINDY AND I WILL NOT VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nI HAVE NEVER VOTED FOR A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATE AND WE WILL NOT VOTE FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nWE WILL WRITE IN THE NAME OF SOME GOOD CONSERVATIVE\nREPUBLICAN WHO IS QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT, JOHN McCAIN,\nPULLING HIS SUPPORT FROM DONALD TRUMP.\nWE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.",

WE ARE OUTSIDE TRUMP TOWER, A\nLARGE CROWD OF SUPPORTERS HAVE GATHERED AS TRUMP EMEMPBLGED\nFROM TRUMP TOWERS MOMENTS AGO, YOU SEE HIM HUCHGERING DOWN WITH\nHIS TEAM STRATEGIZING WHAT TO DO IN THE WAKE OF THIS FALLOUT FROM\nTHAT LEWD, VULGAR AND SEXUALLY AGGRESSIVE REMARK HE MADE IN\nTHAT 2005 VIDEO. DONALD TRUMP COMING OUT, VOWING\nTO STAY IN THIS RACE. HIS SUPPORTERS CHEERING HIM ON.\nTHIS COMES ON A DAY THAT MANY PROMINENT REPUBLICANS HAVE\nWITHDRAWN THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT 31 DAYS\nBEFORE THE ELECTION, AMONG THEM, ARIZONA SENATOR JOHN McCAIN, A\n2008 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, SAYING CINDY AND I WILL NOT VOTE\nFOR DONALD TRUMP. I HAVE NEVER VOTED FOR A\nDEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AND WE WILL NOT VOTE\nFOR HILLARY CLINTON. WE WILL WRITE IN THE NAME OF\nSOME GOOD CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN WHO IS QUALIFIED TO\nBE PRESIDENT.

THE LIST GOES ON AND ON.\nI THINK WE HAVE AN IMAGE TO SHOW OUR VIEWERS THE MAGNITUDE THE\nFALLOUT OF REPUBLICAN SUPPORT 31 DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION, WHERE\nDOES DONALD TRUMP GO FROM HERE? >> WELL, YOU KNOW, TAKE IT ONE\nSTEP FURTHER. IT'S NOT JUST THOSE TWO ARE\nWITHDRAWING SUPPORT. IT'S THOSE WHO ARE CALLING HIM\nTO LEAVE THE RACE ENTIRELY, WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY SAYING, WE\nARE CEDING THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE TO HILLARY CLINTON, THE\nIMPOSSIBILITY TO PUT SOMEONE SE TO RUN AGAINST HILLARY\nCLINTON IN 30 DAYS OR SO IS INSANE.\nIT JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN. AT THIS POINT DONALD TRUMP, HE\nDOES HAVE SUPPORT. WE SAW CERTAINLY THAT OUT THERE.\nHE IS BLEEDING SUPPORT ALMOST EVERY TEN MINUTES, IT SEEMS LIKE\nSOMEBODY ELSE HAS TO PUT A STATEMENT OUT.\nI'M SURPRISED WE HAVEN'T SEEN MORE.\nWE WILL OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS. THERE WILL BE PRESSURE ON\nREPUBLICANS TO DO SO. > DAVID GERGEN, YOU MADE AN\nINTERESTING POINT LAST HOUR, YOU ARE SAYING WE ARE SEEING\nSOMETHING WE HAVEN'T SEEN IN A MODERN RACE, A DIVISION BETWEEN\nTHE PEOPLE AND THE PARTY. >> ABSOLUTELY.\nTHINK ABOUT IT THIS WAY. I THINK THERE ARE FIVE PEOPLE\nTHAT ARRIVED TODAY THE NOMINEES OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN THE\nPAST FOR PRESIDENT. FOUR OF THEM NOW HAVE COME OUT\nBASICALLY AGAINST TRUMP. >> STOOD BEHIND HIM, BOB DEAL?\n>> BOB DEAL, I THINK MARK IS RIGHT, WE MAY BE WAITING FOR\nDOLE. I'M SURE HE'S INVOLVED.\nAND I'M SURE ELIZABETH DEAL IS VERY INVOLVED.\nSO, IT IS, I DON'T THINK WE'VE EVER SEEN ANYTHING QUITE THIS\nCLEAR CUT IN WHICH THE PEOPLE ARE SO ANGRY AT THE\nESTABLISHMENT, THEY'RE GOING TO RALLY AROUND TRUMP.\nI THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF GUYS OUT THERE, BUT A LOT OF WOMEN,\nWHAT WE DON'T KNOW, OUR WORKING SENSE IS, THIS IS GOING TO COST\nTRUMP VOTES, ESPECIALLY WITH WOMEN.\n>> HE ALREADY HAS A TON OF FEMALE SUPPORT.\n>> WHAT MAY HAPPEN IS IF TRUMP COMES OUT AS A FIGHTER AND TAKES\nON THE ESTABLISHm, TAKES ON US AND THE MEDIA AND ALL THE REST,\nHE MAY FIND THAT PEOPLE LIKE THE UNDERDOG.\n>> THAT'S SOMEONE THEY LOVE THROUGH THE PRIMARY ABOUT DONALD\nTRUMP, HIS TWEETS EXACTLY LIKE WHAT HE SAID OUT HERE, IT'S THE\nMEDIA'S FAULT. I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU, THE\nPEOPLE. THERE IS NO DOUBT THIS HELPS HIM\nWITH HIS SUPPORTERS. BUT THAT'S THE POINT HERE FOR\nDONALD TRUMP. HE NEEDS TO EXPAND HIS BASE.\nIT'S NOT WILL HIS SUPPORTERS SHOW UP OR NOT.\nIT'S ABOUT REACHING OUT TO THE PEOPLE THAT CAN DEFEND HIM RIGHT\nNOW, WOMEN. AND SO HIM COMING OUT, HIM DOING\nTHESE THREE PRINT INTERVIEWS THIS MORNING, HE WAS REALLY\nDEFIANT IN SAYING THAT, YOU KNOW, MY SUPPORTERS, THEY GET\nIT. >> THAT REALLY STRUCK ME.\nMY SUPPORTERS GET IT. >> THAT TO ME MAKES BELIEVE THAT\nDONALD TRUMP DOESN'T GET IT. THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT MORE THAN\nATTRACTING YOUR TRIED AND TRUE SUPPORTERS WHO HAVE BEEN THERE\nIN THE BEGINNING IN THE GENERAL ELECTION.\nIT IS ABOUT EXPANDING YOUR BASE, REAPING OUT, BRILLING NEW PEOPLE\nINTO THE FOLD. WE'LL SEE BETWEEN NOW AND THEN.\n>> HE CANNOT WIN WITH JUST HIS BASE.\nHE CANNOT MATHEMATICALLY DO IT. THIS ELECTORATE IS MORE DIVERSE\nTHAN UNDER ROMNEY. ROMNEY COULDN'T DO IT.\n>> I HAVE TO GET A QUICK BREAK, STAY WITH ME.\nMORE BREAKING NEWS FROM THE SITE OF THE NEXT PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE\nTOMORROW NIGHT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.",

THE BIG CROWD THAT WERE OUTSIDE\nOF TRUMP TOWER, THEY'RE MOSTLY GONE NOW, THERE ARE STILL\nTOURISTS OUTSIDE TAKING PHOTOS, BUT REALLY THINGS HAVE QUIETED\nDOWN A GOOD AMOUNT. AND I WONDER IF PART OF THIS IS\nBECAUSE DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF, AS YOU SAW A LITTLE WHILE AGO, CAME\nOUT TO PERSONALLY GREET HIS SUPPORTERS.\nIT REALLY DOESN'T GET BETTER THAN THAT.\nTHE FACT THAT HE CAME OUT AND REVEL IN THE FACT THAT THERE WAS\nDOZENS AND DOZENS OF SUPPORTERS OUTSIDE OF TRUMP TOWER ALL DAY\nSHOWING THEIR SUPPORT.

ALL OF THE ISSUES SWIRLING\nAROUND THE CAMPAIGN FOR THE LAST TOUR HOURS, THEY'RE LIKELY TO\nCOME UP ON THE DEBATE STAGE TOMORROW.\nTHINGS ARE STARTING TO WIND DOWN HERE AT TRUMP TOWER.\n>> A HUGE NIGHT. IT IS ALSO THE FIRST TIME WE\nHAVE BEEN ABLE TO HEAR FROM HILLARY CLINTON.\n>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, LET'S TAKE A MOMENT AND CONSIDER THESE\nNAMES. THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, JOHN\nRYAN, JOHN KASICH, THE GOVERNOR OF OHIO, ONE OF THE LAST ONES IN\nTHE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY, ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER.\nSENATOR JOHN McCAIN, AND CONDOLEEZZA RICE.\nTHEY'RE ALL BIG REPUBLICAN NAMES NOT STANDING BY TRUMP.\nTHEY'RE JUMP SET AND OFFENDED BY HIS LANGUAGE AND BEHAVIOR.\nTHEY SAY THEY WILL NO LONGER VOTE FOR HIM OR SUPPORT HIM ON\nELECTION DAY. MY PANEL IS HERE WITH ME.\nTHANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. 48 HOURS AGO I DO NOT THINK WE\nTHOUGHT THIS IS WHAT WE WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT.\nSITTING IN FRONT OF THE SITE OF TOMORROW NIGHT'S DEBATE.\nTHIS IS BIGGER THAN ANY ONE PERSON.\nTHIS IS A MOMENT YOU SAY WE HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN IN MODERN\nELECTIONS. >> WE'LL REMEMBER THIS FOR A\nLONG TIME. BASICALLY A CIVIL WAR IS\nBREAKING OUT IN THE REPUBLICAN RANKS.\nYOU HAVE AN AVALANCHE OF TOPNOTCH REPUBLICANS SAYING THEY\nCANNOT SUPPORT TRUMP. AT THE SAME TIME, TRUMP IS\nRALLYING THE PEOPLE. AND THAT EVENT OUTSIDE OF TRUMP\nTOWER, THAT WAS DEFIANT. AND --\n>> HE CAME OUT WITH HIS HAND UP. >> HIS FIST UP, BASICALLY HE IS\nRECASTING THIS AS THE PEOPLE VERSUS THE ELITES AND IT'S A\nWAR. I WILL FIGHT ON.\nI THINK HE FEELS HIS ONE WAY OUT OF THIS IS TO RALLY PEOPLE\nBEHIND HIM AND FORCE HIS WAY THROUGH.\n>> I HAVE BEEN SO KEEN TO HEAR, AND WE WILL HEAR FOR AWHILE, IS\nFROM KELLYANN CONWAY. HIS THIRD CAMPAIGN MANAGER.\nA WOMAN, WHAT WILL HER VOICE BE IN THIS, WHAT DOES SHE SAY?\n>> I THINK EVERYONE IS WAITING TO SEE HOW HE DOES ON THAT\nDEBATE STAGE HERE TOMORROW NIGHT IN THAT TOWN HALL WHERE WE\nIMAGINE THIS WILL COME UP AND IT WILL BE A DELICATE SITUATION.\nAND I THINK EVERYONE IS WAITING TO SEE -- TO ESTABLISH WHAT\nCOMES OUT OF THAT, AND HOW KELLYANN CONWAY SPINS IT.\nSHE HAS BEEN ON OUR AIR TOUTING TRUMP, BEING THE DONALD TRUMP\nWHISPERER IN SOME WAYS, AND WAS VERY MUCH BROUGHT IN TO MASSAGE\nHIS IMAGE, PARTICULARLY WITH WOMEN AND IT HAS NOT WORKED,\nRIGHT? IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE SHE COULD\nSPIN THIS IN A WAY THAT MAKES IT GO AWAY.\nAND IT'S NOT ONLY WITH WOMEN. WHEN WE LOOK AT HIS NUMBERS, HE\nIS GETTING SUPPORT AMONG MEN ACROSS THE BOARD AND EVEN WITH\nTHOSE NON-COLLEGE WHITES AS WELL.\nTHOSE SUPPORTERS AS WELL. SO IT IS HARD TO SEE WHAT\nKELLYANN CONWAY CAN SAY TO MAKE THIS BETTER, AND TO MAKE IT GO\nAWAY. >> SHE IS THE ONE THAT GOT HIM\nBACK ON SCRIPT. >> SHE WAS THE FIRST 20 OR 30\nMINUTES OF THE LAST DEBATE. MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT WAS THE\nKELLYA NSHLGS N EFFECT. THINK ABOUT LAST REPUBLICANS,\nTHAT'S LIVING REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTS.\nFOUR OF THE FIVE STANDARD BARERS HAVE WALKED AWAY FROM THIS MAN.\nGEORGE H.W., GEORGE W, JOHN McCAIN, WALKING AWAY.\nBOB DOLE WE HAVE NOT HEARD FROM YET.\nPUT THIS IN CONTEXT FOR US. >> I THINK IF YOU TAKE A QUICK\nSTEP BACK. WE'RE REALLY HERE BECAUSE DONALD\nTRUMP SAID HE COULD SEXUALLY ASSAULT A WOMAN AND GET AWAY\nWITH IT BECAUSE OF HIS POWER.

THAT WAS THE SCENE JUST A SHORT\nTIME AGO. TRUMP MADE A SURPRISE APPEARANCE\nTONIGHT, THEY ARE CHEERING DESPITE A VIDEO OF HIM BEING\nEXPOSED ABOUT HIM MAKING VULGAR AND EXPLICIT COMMENTS ABOUT HIM\nGRABBING A WOMAN'S GENITALS. THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS IF\nANYTHING DEFIANT. RUDY GIULIANI JUST SPOKE TO\nMOMENTS AFTER LEAVING. >> WILL HE BE AT THE DEBATE\nTOMORROW? >> IS THERE ANYTHING THAT COULD\nHAPPEN THAT WOULD MAKE HIM DROP OUT?\n>> THERE IS NOTHING THAT WOULD CAUSE HIS DROPPING OUT.\nTHAT IS WISHFUL THINKING OF THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN.\nAND THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE OPPOSED HIM FOR A LONG TIME, HE\nIS IN THE RACE TO WIN. >> WHAT DO YOU THINK OF SO MANY\nFELLOW REPUBLICANS BACKING UP. >> THEY LARGELY DIDN'T SUPPORT\nHIM IN THE FIRST PLACE, SO IT'S NOT MUCH OF A SURPRISE.\nTHEY OPPOSED HIM AND DIDN'T SUPPORT HIM IN THE PAST, AND\nTHIS IS THE INSIDERS AGAINST THE OUTSIDERS ANYWAY.\nDONALD TRUMP IS THE POPULOUS CANDIDATE.\nMOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT TURNED ON HIM ARE MEMBERS OF THE\nESTABLISHMENT. I RECEIVE THIS AS \"IF YOU WANT\nCHANGE IN WASHINGTON, YOU VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nIF YOU WANT TO KEEP THINGS THE SAME YOU VOTE FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON.\" >> THANK YOU, THANK YOU.\n>> THANK YOU. >> THERE YOU HAVE IT, RUDY\nGIULIANI SAYING THAT TRUMP IS IN IT TO WIN IT.\nTRUMP SAYS HE IS VOWING TO STAY IN THE RACE.\nMY PANEL IS JOINING ME NOW, THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE.\nDOUGLAS TO YOU, TAKE ME BACK TO THE ELECTION OF 1912, AN\nELECTION THAT -- >> IN 1912, THEODORE ROOSEVELT\nSPLIT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN TWO, PUNISHED WILLIAM HOWARD\nTAFT, AND TR CAME IN SECOND. WOODROW WILSON WHO WAS NOT THAT\nPOPULAR TO WIN, IF YOU COMBINED TAFT WITH ROOST SELT, BUT THEY\nSPLIT THE PARTY. >> TO ME, THIS IS LIKE 1968.\nTHE STATES THAT TRUMP WILL WIN ARE THE SOUTH AND THAT HAS\nALWAYS BEEN THAT VOTE, IT DOESN'T REALLY GO AWAY.\nIT A PEERED IN 1972. HE IS A MOVEMENT POLITPOLITICIAT\nA REPUBLICAN. >> AND RUDY GIULIANI SAID JUST\nTHAT. THIS IS THE INSIDERS VERSUS THE\nOUTSIDERS AND YOU CALL THIS UNPRECEDENTED?\n>> YEAH, I THINK 1912 WAS MORE PERSONALITIES, TEDDY ROOSEVELT\nWAS VERY HAPPY TO PRACTICE THE PA\nSPLIT. AND IT WAS SO CLEARLY, HE WANTS\nTO GO AFTER THE ESTABLISHMENT, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, AND THE\nMEDIA. HE IS LUMPING THEM TOGETHER.\n>> THAT WORKS FOR THE VOTERS THAT ALREADY LOVED HIM, IT\nDOESN'T HELP HIM GET MORE VOTERS ON BOARD.\n>> THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN HIS PROBLEM, RIGHT?\nIF YOU LOOK BACK TO THE GOP OCCUPATION, IT STOOD FOR GROWTH\nAND OPPORTUNITY PROJECT. TRUMP IS NOT A GROWTH AND\nOPPORTUNITY PROJECT TO EXPAND THE GROUP OF PEOPLE THEY'RE\nALREADY GETTING. AND YOU SEE HIM DOING POORLY\nWITH PEOPLE THEY NORMALLY GET. HILLARY CLINTON IS VERY\nCOMPETITIVE WITH VOTERS OVER 65. AND WHAT STARTED IN THE MINUTES\nAFTER THAT DEBATE, WHEN PEOPLE SAW HE LOST THAT DEBATE, AND YOU\nSEE THAT SHOWING UP IN THE POLLS, SOME OF HIS SUPPORT JUST\nSTARTING TO FAULTER. >> CAN MIKE PENCE SAVE DONALD\nTRUMP? WITH THE LIKELIHOOD OF MIKE\nPENCE GETTING ON THE TOP OF THE TICKET IS NIL AT THIS TIME.\n>> IT'S SMALL. >> CAN HE HELP TRUMP PULL\nTHROUGH ON THIS? >> NO, I THINK ONLY DONALD TRUMP\nCAN DO THAT. AND THAT IS WHY SO MUCH HINGES\nON THIS THE SECOND DEBATE. A LOT OF REPUBLICANS FEEL THAT\nIF DONALD TRUMP REMAINS ON THE TOP OF THE TICKET, HE WILL TAKE\nHIMSELF DOWN, IF THEY LOSE THE SENATE, THEY MIGHT LOSE THE\nHOUSE, AND THEY THINK THE HONORABLE THING THOUGH DO, AND I\nHAPPEN TO AGREE WITH THIS, IS FOR HIM TO WITHDRAWAL.\nAND THAT IS ONE WAY THAT HE CAN SAY -- DOES HE NOT FEEL HE OWES\nANYTHING TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY?\n>> NO, HE SAID HE IS NOT GOING TO.\nA LESSON FROM HISTORY WANT TO, WHAT IS IT?\n>> IN 1972 WE HAD WATER GGATE, WAS ALL ON THE NEWS, IT WAS\nRIGHT BEFORE THE ELECTION, IT DIDN'T HURT NIXON, BUT THERE WAS\nNO TAPES. TRUMP DISGRACED HIMSELF.\nTHE PARTY IS FLEEING IN GROVES RIGHT NOW.\nWOMEN FIRST GOT THE RIGHT TO VOTE IN 1920, IT HAS BEEN A LONG\nMOVEMENT. THIS IS A GIFT, THIS TAPE WE\nHAVE BEEN WATCHING OVER AND OVER AGAIN SHOWING HIM AS A SEXUALLY\nPREDATOR. WE'RE ON A CAMPUS, WHERE THEY'RE\nTEACHING MEN IN DORMITORIES AND ATHLETIC TEAMS NOT TO ACT LIKE\nDONALD TRUMP DID. THIS IS NOT 1992 WITH BILL\nCLINTON ANY MORE. THIS IS AN ERA OF WOMEN AND\nEQUALITY AND TRUMP IS FLUNKING OUT BUT IN THE END HIS BRAND IS\nNOT TARNISHED, IT'S THE G.O.P. AND REPUBLICANS, THE JOINT\nFORCES CARRYING THE TAINT OF TRUMP WITH HIM FOR THE REST OF\nTHEIR LIVES. >> SO MANY LEANING MEMBERS\nPULLING AS FAR AWAY FROM HIM AS THEY CAN TONIGHT.\nTHANK YOU ALL, WE APPRECIATE IT. MUCH MORE AFTER THIS LIVE FROM\nWASHINGTON UNIVERSITY, THE SITE OF THE DEBATE TOMORROW NIGHT,\nJUST ABOUT 24 HOURS AWAY. A QUICK BREAK AND WE'RE BACK ON\nTHE OTHER SIDE.",

THEY THINK THERE COULD BE A HUGE\nBOMBSHELL THAT IS GOING TO HIT REGARDING HILLARY CLINTON.\nWE DID SEE SOME E-MAILS THAT GOT RELEASED FROM WIKILEAKS.\nWE DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE NECESSARILY TRUE THAT HAD WE NOT\nBEEN IN THE SITUATION RIGHT NOW WITH DONALD TRUMP WOULD HAVE\nBEEN VERY BAD FOR HILLARY CLINTON, BUT AS BRIAN SAID, YOU\nHAVE A DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT ARE UNIFIED.\nYOU HAVE A REPUBLICAN PARTY THAT IS BEYOND FRACTURED, IT IS\nBROKEN. >> IS THERE A WAY TO REPAIR IT\nAT ALL? SUNLEN USED THE TERM PREDATORY.\nTHAT'S A WORD THAT'S GOING TO BE HEARD ON THE DEBATE STAGE IN A\nNUMBER OF HOURS. THAT IS SO BEYOND DAMAGING FOR\nDONALD TRUMP. I'M NOT SURE -- ALL THE\nREPORTING SO FAR INDICATES HE DOES NOT REALIZE IT.\nTHAT HE IS IN TRUMP TOWER, HE IS RELATIVELY ISOLATED FROM WHAT'S\nGOING ON. THAT SOMETIMES IS A CONSEQUENCE\nOF BEING A BILLIONAIRE BUSINESSMAN, OF HAVING YOUR OWN\nTOWER, OF HAVING YOUR OWN ADVISORS THAT YOU DEPEND ON.\nI WOULD ASSUME HE'S BEEN WATCHING CABLE NEWS.\nMAYBE IT HASN'T SUNK IN FOR HIM THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT\nHAPPENED. >> ESPECIALLY WHAT WE SAW\nYESTERDAY AFTERNOON. HE HAD SCORES OF SUPPORTERS\nTHERE CHEERING HIM ON. >> SOAKING IT UP.\n>> SOAKING IT UP. >> NOT VERY PRESIDENTIAL FOR HIM\nTO DO THAT. >> YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT\nHE FEELS UNDER SIEGE. THE BRIGHTEST POINT, HE\nRETWEETED OR TWEETED YESTERDAY BEEN AN INTERESTING 24 HOURS.\nYEAH, IT HAS BEEN. >> IT CERTAINLY HAS BEEN.\n>> MARK PRESTON, BRIAN STELTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nWE'LL CONTINUE TOMORROW MORNING. TONIGHT'S DEBATE IS SURE TO BE\nONE YOU DO NOT WANT TO MISS. ANDERSON COOPER CO-MODERATES.\n>>> HOW DOES THIS WEEKEND OF",

THE SHOCKING 2005 AUDIOTAPE THAT\nDROPPED ON FRIDAY MOST LIKELY, ALMOST CERTAINLY DID NOT HELP.\nWILL THE FALLOUT MOVE THE POLLS IN STATES LIKE OHIO, THE ONE\nBATTLEGROUND TRUMP HAD STRONG NUMBERS AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHE QUINNIPIAC POLL TAKEN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MONTH SHOWS\nTRUMP THERE WITH A 5 POINT LEAD, OUTSIDE THE MARGIN OF ERROR.\nTHIS MORNING OHIO SENATOR IS JOINING OTHER OHIO REPUBLICANS\nWHO SAY THEY CANNOT SUPPORT TRUMP.\nIN A STATEMENT HE WRITES THIS, WHILE I CONTINUE TO RESPECT\nTHOSE WHO STILL SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP, I CAN NO LONGER SUPPORT\nHIM. I WILL BE VOTING FOR MIKE PENCE\nFOR PRESIDENT. THEN THERE'S OHIO GOVERNOR JOHN\nKASICH. HE SAYS DONALD TRUMP'S ACTIONS\nAND WORDS ON THAT AUDIOTAPE ARE DISGUSTING BUT UNLIKE MANY OF\nHIS GOP COLLEAGUES HE STOPS SHORT OF CALLING FOR TRUMP TO\nDROP OUT OF THE RACE. GOVERNOR KASICH TALKED WITH DANA\nBASH YESTERDAY WHILE SPEAKING ABOUT ELECTED REPUBLICANS.\nYOU KNOW, THEY'VE KIND OF COME TO THIS PARTY LATE.\nI APPRECIATE THEIR VIEW. I DON'T THINK I NEED TO DO\nANY MORE AT THIS POINT. NOBODY HAS BEEN CLEAR ABOUT HIS\nFEELINGS TOWARDS HIM OR NOT MANY AS I HAVE.\nYOU HAVE A REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE AND THEY HAVE TO\nFIGURE THIS OUT. BACK HERE WITH ME IS MARK\nPRESTON. HAVING TO FIGURE THIS OUT.\nWE HEARD FROM CHARLIE BENT, CONGRESSMAN FROM PENNSYLVANIA,\nSAYING THEY HAVE TO GET DONALD TRUMP TO GET OUT OF THE WAY?\n>> RIGHT. >> AND IF REINCE PRIEBUS CAN'T\nDO IT THEN HE NEEDS TO RESIGN. >> A COUPLE OF THINGS, TOO.\nJOHN KASICH INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH ISN'T SAYING DONALD TRUMP NEEDS\nTO GET OUT OF THE RACE. LET'S TAKE A STEP BACK.\nI THINK HE WANTS TO RUN IN 2020 HIMSELF.\nJOHN KASICH ALSO HOSTED THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION\nIN CLEVELAND AND REFUSED TO GO BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP WAS THE\nNOMINEE. AS FAR AS CHARLIE DENT GOES, HE\nCOMES FROM PENNSYLVANIA. DONALD TRUMP NEEDS HIM IN\nPENNSYLVANIA. TALKING TO PEOPLE IN THE STATE\nRIGHT NOW, THEY THINK DONALD TRUMP HAS NO SHOT OF WINNING\nPENNSYLVANIA AT THIS POINT DUE TO THOSE COMMENTS.\n>> UTAH, YOU HAD GOVERNOR HERBERT RESCINDING HIS SUPPORT.\nWE HAD THE FIRST, JASON CHAFFITZ, UTAH CONGRESSMAN,\nRETRACTING HIS ENDORSEMENT. IS THERE POTENTIAL HERE FOR A\nDEMOCRAT, FOR HILLARY CLINTON TO WIN THE STATE OF UTAH?\n>> I DON'T THINK SO, BUT WHAT IT DOES TELL US RIGHT NOW IS THAT\nUTAH IS AN INTERESTING STATE. LET'S NOT FORGET THE ELECTORATE\nIS MORMON. JASON CHAFFITZ SENT US A SIGNAL\nAS DID GOVERNR HERBERT WHEN THEY DECIDED TO BACK OFF EARLY\nREALIZING DONALD TRUMP IS POLITICAL KRYPTONITE IN THAT\nSTATE. WHAT YOU COULD SEE IS A THIRD\nPARTY CANDIDATE, McMULLEN, HASN'T GAINED ENOUGH TRACTION.\nHE COULD SIPHON VOTES FROM DONALD TRUMP.\nI DON'T SEE HILLARY CLINTON WINNING IT.\n>> WE'VE HEARD SOME ESTIMATES THAT POTENTIALLY ON NOVEMBER 9th\nWE'LL WAKE UP WITH DONALD TRUMP IN THE MID 30s, PERCENTAGE OF\nTHE ELECTORATE. IS THAT REALISTIC?\n>> I DON'T SEE HOW HE GOES UP. A LOT WILL HAVE TO DO WITH\nTONIGHT AND HOW HE HANDLES HIMSELF AND HOW HE TRIES TO SHOW\nSOME KIND OF CONTRITION. HE WAS NOT ASKING FOR\nFORGIVENESS. HE WAS LAYING DOWN A MARKER THAT\nHE WAS GOING TO GO AFTER BILL CLINTON.\nWHETHER HE DOES THAT TONIGHT ON THE STAGE WE'LL HAVE TO SEE.\nIF HE DOES, WE WILL HAVE ENTERED AN ENTIRELY NEW PHASE OF THIS\nPRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. HAVING SEEN WHAT WE'VE SEEN SO\nFAR, THAT VERY WELL COULD HAPPEN.\n>> MARK PRESTON, WE'LL HAVE YOU ALL MORNING WITH US.\nCHR CHRISTI, I'M GOING TO SEND IT\nBACK TO YOU. >>> HURRICANE MATTHEW STILL\nCAUSING FLOODING OUT THERE",

CHANCES THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS\nNOT SEEN THAT VIDEO IS -- >> ESPECIALLY SINCE THE WHOLE\nMESSAGING OF THE CAMPAIGN OVER THE LAST COUPLE DAYS HAS BEEN\nABOUT THIS VIDEO. SHE'S SAYING SHE HASN'T SEEN --\nTHIS IS SOMETHING THE CAMPAIGN IS ATTACKING HIM ON.\nSHE'S CLEARLY GOING TO BRING THIS UP, EVEN IF A VOTER DOESN'T\nASK THIS QUESTION, SHE'S GOING TO PIVOT QUICKLY.\nTHE QUESTION IS, HOW DOES DONALD TRUMP RESPOND?\nAS YOU SEE PRETTY QUICK REACTION, THAT'S WHAT REPUBLICAN\nLEADERS WANT TO HEAR. THEY DON'T WANT TO HEAR HIM\nDIGGING IN OR HEAR AN APOLOGY THE WAY THE FRIDAY APOLOGY WENT\nDOWN, SORT OF AN APOLOGY AND THEN HE STARTED TO ATTACK BILL\nCLINTON. THEY WANT TO HEAR SYMPATHY FROM\nDONALD TRUMP. THAT WILL GO A LONG WAY TO\nENSURING THERE ARE NOT MORE DEFECTIONS, PARTICULARLY AMONG\nTHE REPUBLICAN ELECTED LEADERSHIP IN CONGRESS.\nBUT FOR THE MOST PART, THEY ARE BARELY STANDING WITH HIM.\n>> BARELY. >> WE DO KNOW WE HAVE SOURCES\nINVOLVED IN THE DEBATE PLANNING. WE KNOW THE FIRST QUESTIONS IN\nTHE DEBATE WILL BE ABOUT THE TAPE.\nAND BRIAN STELZER IS REPORTING THAT IS, INDEED, GOING TO BE THE\nCASE. THE QUESTION IS ONCE THEY BOTH\nADDRESS IT AND WE FIND OUT HOW ABJECT DONALD TRUMP'S APOLL JAZZ\nTHEN WHAT HAPPENS FOR THE NEXT 85 MINUTES?\n>> I THINK THAT IS INTERESTING WITH THE FORMAT, WITH THE TOWN\nHALL, PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE, REACTION, SHOTS.\nPEOPLE WILL BE WATCHING THE UNDECIDED VOTERS KIND OF JUDGING\nTHE CANDIDATES ON THE STAGE. SO THE EXTENT TO WHICH, YOU\nKNOW, YOU SEE CLINTON TRYING TO COME BACK TO THE TAPE THAT\nHILLARY CLINTON WAS AN ENI BELIEVE -- ENABLER.\nTHAT IS A DANGER FOR THEM GOING INTO THE DEBATE.\n>> IF YOU WATCH TWITTER, ONE OF THE DIRECTIONS DONALD TRUMP IS\nGOING, HE'S BRINGING UP AND RE-TWEETING THINGS ABOUT ANITA\nBRODERICK. IF HE GOES THERE, WHAT DOES THAT\nTELL US ABOUT TONIGHT? >> DOES HE WANT KAMAKAZEE THE\nA AREA?\nI NEED TO SAY WHY I WAS WRONG AND SINCERELY WRONG.\n>> ISN'T THAT GOING AGAINST WHAT HE'S PUT ON TWITTER THIS\nMORNING? LIKE THROWING BOMBS AT HIS\nPARTY? >> THE CHANCES OF HIM DOING THAT\nWOULD BE LOW MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION.\nOR I'M GOING ALL IN WITH THIS STRATEGY.\nMAYBE I'M NOT GOING TO WIN. THE FACT IS THAT HE'S GONE --\nCLEARLY AT FIRST AS WE HEARD FROM SOURCES, HE DIDN'T THINK IT\nWAS THAT BIG OF A DEAL AS HIS CAMPAIGN DID, THEN \"SNL\" DID A\nGREAT JOB OF REACHING OUT. YOU HAVE TO DO THAT.\nYOU THINK ON BENDED KNEE AT THIS POINT.\n>> HE'S ALSO GOT TO REACH OUT TO REPUBLICANS RUNNING FOR THE\nHILLS RIGHT NOW. MAEVE, HE'S ATTACKING\nREPUBLICANS DIRECTLY SAYING SO MANY SELF-RYE CHUS HYPOCRITES\nWATCH THEIR POLL NUMBERS AND ELECTIONS GO DOWN.\nWHAT IS THE LEADERSHIP SAY BUT WHAT IS RYAN OR DONALD TRUMP\nGOING TO DO TONIGHT? TWEETING IS ONE THING, BUT WHAT\nHE SAYS IS ANOTHER POINT. ONE OF THE THINGS THEY ARE GOING\nTO TEST IS HOW HE FEELS TOMORROW MORNING.\nMANY OF THE LEADERS ARE DISCUSSING THE PRESIDENTIAL\nRACE, ABOUT THIS, ABOUT EVERYTHING.\n>> DONALD TRUMP IS TALKING ABOUT THE WEATHER.\n>> EXACTLY. THEY ARE ON RECESS RIGHT NOW.\n>> ABOUT THAT CONTINUING RESOLUTION --\n>> EXACTLY. THEY ARE ON VISAS RIGHT NOW.\nSO THIS IS VERY UNUSUAL YOU'LL HAVE TOMORROW MORNING -- YOU\nWILL ATTACK HOW MANY ARE WAITING TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO.\nN NAY.\n>> MY SENSE IS THAT EVERYONE IS WAITING FOR PAUL RYAN.\nTHOSE ON THE FENCE MAY DEFECT THEIR WAITING THAT MAYBE I DON'T\nWANT TO GET OUT IN FRONT OF THE SPEAKER.\nTHEY ARE GOING TO TAKE HIS LEAD. >> IT'S A RISK FOR HIM\nPOLITICALLY BECAUSE A LOT OF THE MEMBERS ARE BIG TRUMP\nSUPPORTERS. SO HE CAN GET A LOT OF BACKLACK\nFOR THAT. >> NOT JUST PAUL RYAN, BUT YOU\nHAVE TO THINK THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE CUES FROM THIS FLUBBED P\nPERFORMANCE LIKE THE FIRST DEBATE.\n>> THIS ONE IS DOUBLE, TRIPLE, QUADRUPLE CRITICAL.\n>> CRITICAL LIKE C SQUARED.",

THERE ARE THE OFFICERS RIGHT\nTHERE. THE LADY ON THE RIGHT, SHE'S A\nMOTHER. THE GUY ON THE LEFT, HE WAS A\nFATHER OF EIGHT. ANOTHER OFFICER IS IN THE\nHOSPITAL AT THIS HOUR. HOW THIS TRAGEDY ALL UNFOLDED,\nBRIAN. GOOD MORNING, STEVE.\n>> DONALD TRUMP SAYS HE WILL NEVER DROP OUT.\nWHAT DO HIS SUPPORTERS THINK? LOOK AT THIS.\nFIFTH AVENUE, NEW YORK CITY LATE YESTERDAY.\nPEOPLE COMING OUT IN DROVES. WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF THE GRAND\nOLD PARTY AND HOW WILL THAT SHAPE TONIGHT'S MEGA DEBATE?\nWE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT. >> HOPE WE CAN SQUEEZE THAT\nTALKING POINT IN. HILLARY CLINTON IS STAYING\nSILENT ON THE LATEST WIKILEAKS BUT E-MAILS SHOW A VERY\nDIFFERENT HILLARY IN PUBLIC THAN IN PRIVATE.\nSTUNNER. LET ME JUST REMIND YOU, IT'S\nSUNDAY, YOU DIDN'T OVERSLEEP. MORNINGS ARE BETTER WITH\nFRIENDS. \u00e2\u0099\u00aa\u00e2\u0099\u00aa\n>> ONE, TWO. THREE, FOUR.\nONE, TWO. THREE, FOUR.\nONE TWO. THREE, FOUR.\n>> WE ARE LIVE AT WASH U IN THE HEARTS OF ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI,\nFOR THE SECOND PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE.\nHI, EVERYBODY. I'M STEVE DOOCY ALONG WITH THE\nBEAR AND A FEW CHEERLEADERS AND IN NEW YORK CITY, ONLY TWO\nPEOPLE. >> WE TOOK ATTENDANCE.\nYOU'RE MISSING. AT LEAST YOU TURNED UP.\nAND YOU'RE PUTTING UP WITH ALL THE, A LITTLE BIT OF MIST IN THE\nAIR? >> LITTLE ON THE CHILLY SIDE.\nI'M FROM KANSAS AND THIS IS MISSOURI AND WE'RE TOUGH OUT\nHERE. >> STEVE, I THINK WE PROBABLY\nWERE GOING TO HAVE ABOUT 75 MILLION WATCH, WHICH IS PRETTY\nGOOD RATINGS. I THINK WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER\nTHE LAST FEW DAYS. I THINK OVER 100 MILLION PEOPLE\nWILL BE WATCHING TONIGHT AS FOR THE BIG DEBATE.\n>> I AGREE WITH YOU. THE MOST WATCHED DEBATE.\nI HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.\nWHEN YOU SEE THE CHEERLEADERS AND ONE OF US MISSING FROM THE\nCURVY COUCH. YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS.\nDEBATE NIGHT. HILLARY CLINTON, WE'RE ALL GOING\nTO BE WATCHING TONIGHT. STEVE IS THERE LIVE TO GIVE US\nALL THE LOW DOWN. >> WHO'S FOR HILLARY?\nWHO'S COVERING DONALD TRUMP? >> I BET YOU WANT ME TO FILL YOU\nIN. WE HAVE JOHN ROBERTS RIGHT HERE\nLIVE ALONG WITH MIKE EMMANUEL. AND USUALLY IT SAYS IN THE\nPROMPTER WHO SHOULD GO FIRST. I THINK THIS IS A NO-BRAINER,\nMIKE. YOU'RE COVERING HILLARY, BUT,\nACTUALLY, JOHN, IT'S ALL ABOUT TRUMP.\n>> CAN I ASK YOU THIS QUESTION. WHEN IT'S ALL ABOUT NEWS, WHEN\nIS IT NOT ABOUT DONALD TRUMP? THEY RELEASED THAT VIDEOTAPE AND\nTHE AUDIO RECORDING FROM 2005 WHICH RESULTED IN THIS\nINCREDIBLE REACTION FROM MEMBERS OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\nEVEN MALANIA TRUMP SAYING SHE DID NOT LIKE WHAT HE SAID BUT\nSHE'S WILLING TO FORGIVE AND IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON.\nYESTERDAY DONALD TRUMP TOOK THE IMPRESSION, I'VE BEEN OUT IN\nFRONT OF TRUMP TOWERS SO MANY DAYS AND HE NEVER COMES OUT\nFRONT. YESTERDAY HE HAD TO DO SOME\nDEBATE PREP AT TRUMP TOWERS. THERE HE IS WITH THE SECRET\nSERVICE ENTOURAGE OUT ON FIFTH AVENUE RIGHT OUT ON IN FRONT OF\nTRUMP TOWER. ALL THIS TALK ABOUT WHETHER OR\nNOT HE WOULD DROP OUT OF THE RACE AND SO MANY CALLS FROM SO\nMANY REPUBLICANS AND LISTEN TO RUDY GIULIANI WHO SPENT THE DAY\nIN DEBATE PREP SAID ABOUT ALL THAT YESTERDAY.\n>> THERE IS NOTHING GOING TO CAUSE SOMETHING TO HAPPEN.\nTHAT DAY WISHFUL THINKING OF THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN.\nAND THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE OPPOSED HIM FOR A LONG TIME.\n>> SO, FOR MOST OF THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS DONALD TRUMP HAS\nBEEN ENGAGED IN DEBATE PREP AT TRUMP TOWER ALONG WITH GIULIANI\nAND CHRIS CHRISTIE. THIS WAS WILDLY SEEN AS GETTING\nHIM USED TO THE TOWN HALL FORMAT, WHICH HE HASN'T DONE A\nLOT OF. CHRIS CHRISTIE IS THE MASTER OF\nTHE TOWN HALL. THEY THOUGHT HE WOULD BE A GOOD\nPERSON TO BRING IN. BODY LANGUAGE AND HOW TO PIVOT\nTO A DIFFERENT ANSWER. BUT ALL BETS ARE OFF AS TO HOW\nTHIS THING IS GOING TO GO TONIGHT BECAUSE WILL THE FIRST\nQUESTION OUT OF THE BOX BE ABOUT THIS RECORDING FROM 2005.\n>> IF IT'S NOT, DONALD TRUMP WILL TURN IT AROUND.\n>> THE STRATEGY THAT THEY'RE EMPLOYING YESTERDAY AFTERNOON\nAND TODAY IS DENOUNCE HIS REMARKS BUT THEN SAY WE FORGIVE\nHIM AND IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON. THAT'S CERTAINLY WHAT MEMBERS OF\nHIS CAMPAIGN ARE DOING AND SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE, INCLUDING\nCONDOLEEZZA RICE. ENOUGH EXCLAMATION POINTS, TIME\nFOR HIM TO GO. >> THAT'S THE REPUBLICAN HALF OF\nTHE STORY. HILLARY CLINTON WE HAVEN'T SEEN\nMUCH OF HER. I BET SHE WAS AT THE HOTEL YOU\nWERE STANDING OUT IN FRONT OF YESTERDAY.\n>> DOING EIGHT HOURS OF PREP AND HER CAMPAIGN DON'T WANT TO GET\nIN THE WAY OF THE FALLOUT OF THE DONALD TRUMP CONTROVERSY.\nTHEY'RE SAVING HER REACTION FOR TONIGHT ON THE BIG STAGE WITH\nTHE HUGE AUDIENCE WATCHING. THEY WANT IT TO BE FRESH AND\nMAKE NEWS. THEY KEPT HER OUT OF THE\nSPOTLIGHT. EIGHT HOURS AT THAT HOTEL\nYESTERDAY AND GOING THROUGH THE BOOKS AND THE MOCK DEBATES AND\nESPECIALLY SETTING UP FOR TONIGHT AND DEALING WITH THE\nFALLOUT OF MORE LEAKED E-MAILS FROM WIKILEAKS SAYING SOME\nTHINGS ABOUT CLINTON THAT, YOU KNOW, PERHAPS SHE DIDN'T WANT\nOUT THERE IN THE PUBLIC. TALKING ABOUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO\nHAVE TWO DIFFERENT POSITIONS. A PUBLIC POSITION AND PRIVATE\nPOSITION ON THINGS LIKE THE BANKS AND SUGGESTING THAT WALL\nSTREET WOULD BE BEST REFORMED BY WALL STREET INSIDERS AND THAT\nWILL MAKE BERNIE SANDERS AND HIS SUPPORTERS CRAZY.\nALSO TALKING ABOUT OPEN BORDERS. HER CAMPAIGN IS NOT CONFIRMING\nTHE AUTHENTICITY OF THESE E-MAILS.\nNOT DENYING HE WAS HACKED AND THIS STUFF WAS STOLEN.\nREACTION TO DONALD TRUMP'S LATEST CONTROVERSY AND REACTION\nTONIGHT FROM THE LATEST FROM WIKILEAKS ABOUT WHETHER SHE'S\nSAYING CERTAIN THINGS TO THE BANKS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS.\n>> THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN PRACTICING\nYESTERDAY. YESTERDAY THEY PUT OUT TEN\nTHINGS HILLARY CLINTON DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE REVEALED.\nPLUS, DONALD TRUMP WILL TALK ABOUT THAT A LOT, AS WELL.\n>> WELCOME TO ST. LOUIS. >> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.\n>> AS YOU KNOW, YESTERDAY, TRUMP TOWERS PRETTY CLOSE TO US.\nWHEN DONALD TRUMP CAME OUT THE  A LONG TIME, IT WAS CLEAR HE HAD\nSUPPORTERS BEHIND HIM. THIS IS THE DEAL.\n>> YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO IT. >> WE'RE JUST TRYING TO GAIN\nFROM IT. FEEL, YOU KNOW, THAT WE SHOULD\nBE ALL TOGETHER. WE'RE ALL FOR THE SAME THING,\nYOU KNOW. STOPPING ISIS AND CLOSING OUR\nBORDERS AND GETTING RID OF OUR DEBT.\n>> I UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY WERE DOING.\nIT IS PRETTY AWFUL. THAT WAS 11 YEARS AGO AND I\nTHINK THEY SHOULD GO BEHIND TRUMP AND STAND BEHIND HIM.\n>> IT'S BAD FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND THEY SHOULD REALLY BE\nSTANDING BEHIND TRUMP RIGHT NOW. >> THOSE THREE WOMEN WE SAW\nRIGHT THERE WERE AT THE PAUL RYAN EVENT YESTERDAY UP IN\nWISCONSIN. THE CORRESPONDENT OUT IN THE\nFIELD ASKED THEM, OKAY, DONALD TRUMP, YOU KNOW, HE SAID THOSE",

YOU THINK ABOUT THE QUESTION\nMEGYN ASKED HIM ABOUT IN THE BEGINNING.\nTHIS IS ONE GROUP HE NEEDS MORE THAN ANY OTHER GROUP AND HE DID\nMAKE TRACTION WITH WOMEN AT ONE POINT.\n>> HE DID. AND YOU TURNED THE CORNER IN\nSEPTEMBER AND HE STARTED TO COME AROUND AND IT WAS BECAUSE HE WAS\nACTING HUMANE AND BECAUSE HE WAS ACTING MORE STEADY --\n>> TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUES. >> AND NOW WE WILL SEE.\nHIS CAMPAIGN COMES TO THE CROSSROADS AND SO DOES IN A LOT\nOF WAYS THIS COUNTRY. >> FASCINATING AND IMPORTANT.\nALL OF IT. >> YEAH.\n>> GREAT TO SEE YOU AS ALWAYS.

TRUMP AND WARNING PEOPLE ABOUT\nWRITING HIM OFF TOO SOON WHEN HE SAID THAT.\n>> HE NEEDS TO BE HIMSELF. HE NEEDS TOZE CLEARLY.\nHE NEEDS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT HE UNDERSTANDS THIS\nKIND OF TALK IS UNACCEPTABLE, AND HE HAS TO STOP IT.\nAND THEN HE'S GOT TO REFOCUS THIS WHOLE QUESTION ON WHAT YOU\nWANT FOR AMERICA. TWICE HE'S BEEN DOWN.\nTWICE HE'S COME BACK TO LEAD. NOW HE'S DOWN AGAIN PRESUMABLY.\nI THINK HE CAN MOVE TOWARD NOVEMBER ON THESE ISSUES.\n>> THAT FROM EARLIER TODAY AND OUR POLITICAL REPORT FOR REAL\nCLEAR POLITICS WITH ME NOW. GOOD DAY TO YOU.\n>> GOOD DAY. >> HAPPY SUNDAY.\nHE'S BEEN DOWN TWICE AND HE'S COME BACK TO LEAD.\nAND WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE POSTURE FOR TRUMP NOW.\nYOU SEE HIM, AS I SEE HIM, OVER THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS AS GOING\nBACK ON OFFENSE. FRAME THAT.\n>> ABSOLUTELY. SO WE SAW IN THE APOLOGY VIDEO\nTHAT THE CAMPAIGN ISSUED FRIDAY NIGHT.\nHE DID APOLOGIZE BUT THEN QUICKLY MOVED TO CHANGE THE\nSUBJECT TO BILL CLINTON AND HILLARY CLINTON, AND WE'VE SEEN\nTHROUGH RUDY GIULIANI'S INTERVIEWS TODAY AND ALSO\nTRUMP'S TWEETS OVERNIGHT THAT THAT'S WHERE HE WANTS TO TAKE\nTHIS, AND NOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT LOTS OF REPUBLICANS DON'T\nWANT HIM TO GO DOWN THAT AVENUE, GOING AFTER HILLARY CLINTON FOR\nHER HUSBAND'S INFIDELITIES AND HER ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT IN\nCOVERING OR MOVING -- TRYING TO MOVE PAST THOSE AS WELL.\nREPUBLICANS HAVE SEEN IN POLLING THAT THAT WILL BACKFIRE.\nTHEY'VE SEEN THE REVERSE EFFECT, REPUBLICANS MOVING CLOSER OR AT\nLEAST SYMPATHIZING WITH CLINTON IN WAYS WHEN THEY BRING THAT UP.\n>> RUDY GIULIANI SAID TODAY HE DID NOT THINK HE WOULD BRING UP\nBILL CLINTON BUT HE SUGGESTED HE MAY REFER TO HILLARY'S REACTION\nTO FEMALE ACCUSERS IN THE PAST. IN THE VIDEO HE SAID HILLARY HAS\nATTACKED, SHAMED, AND BULLIED THE VICTIMS.\nSEE MORE IN THE DEBATE ON SUNDAY NIGHT.\nTHERE'S A CLUE IN THERE. >> EXACTLY.\nWE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE, TRUMP, WHEN HE'S ATTACKED AND HE\nFEELS LIKE HE IS BEING ATTACKED RIGHT NOW, WE SAW IN THE TWEETS\nYESTERDAY, HE SAID THE MEDIA AND REPUBLICANS WANT ME TO GET OUT.\nI'M NEVER LEAVING THIS RACE. HE WAS ALSO TWEETING TODAY ABOUT\nREPUBLICANS WHO WERE LEAVING THE CAMPAIGN WHO WERE NOT SUPPORTING\nHIM, WITHDRAWING ENDORSEMENTS AND ASKING HIM TO LEAVE THE\nTICKET SAYING THAT THEY WILL FACE A BACKLASH OF THEIR OWN.\nSO HE IS IN A VERY AGGRESSIVE POSTURE RIGHT NOW, AND HE FEELS\nLIKE HE IS BEING ATTACKED. AND I WAS TALKING TO A LOT OF\nHIS SUPPORTERS OUTSIDE TRUMP TOWER YESTERDAY, AND A LOT OF\nTHEM WERE SAYING THE SAME KIND OF THING, THAT THE MEDIA IS\nBLOWING THIS UP AND SO FORTH. AND SO THAT'S KIND OF WHERE HE'S\nTAKING COMFORT IN THOSE SUPPORTERS.\nTHE PROBLEM THOUGH IS THAT LOTS OF OTHER PEOPLE WANT HIM TO BE\nMORE SINCERE AND APOLOGIZE FURTHER AND GET THIS\nCONVERSATION BACK ON ISSUES. >> HERE ARE SOME OF THE TWEETS\nFROM EARLIER TODAY. SO MANY SELF-RIGHTEOUS\nHYPOCRITES REFERRING TO, I WOULD IMAGINE, REPUBLICANS AND OTHERS\nON SCREEN. HE SAID SO MANY SELF-RIGHTEOUS\nHYPOCRITES. WATCH THEIR POLL NUMBERS AND\nELECTIONS GO DOWN. ANOTHER ONE, TREMENDOUS SUPPORT\nEXCEPT FOR SOME REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP.\nTHANK YOU. REFERRING TO THE SUPPORT.\n>> EXACTLY. A LOT OF THESE REPUBLICANS, YOU\nKNOW, TRUMP WASN'T THEIR FIRST CHOICE, BUT A LOT OF THEM ARE\nASKING HIM TO LEAVE THE TICKET. NOW, OF COURSE, WE KNOW FROM\nTALKING TO EXPERTS THAT THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE.\nBALLOTS HAVE BEEN PRINTED. PEOPLE ARE ALREADY VOTING.\nEARLY VOTING HAS BEGUN IN SEVERAL STATES SO THAT IS NOT\nPOSSIBLE. BUT YOU'RE SEEING A HEMORRHAGING\nOF SUPPORT FROM THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WHICH IS SIGNIFICANT.\nCAMPAIGNS ARE ABOUT ADDITION AND NOT SUBTRACTION.\nTRUMP HAS BEEN FALLING BEHIND BEFORE ALL THIS IN KEY\nBATTLEGROUND STATES AND NATIONALLY, AND HIS GOAL WAS TO\nGAIN MORE SUPPORT, AND BY LOSING  THE REPUBLICAN\nPARTY, THAT MAKES IT ALL THE MORE DIFFICULT.\n>> FLIP THIS AROUND A LITTLE BIT.\nIF HE DOES GO THERE, HOW IS SHE PREPARED TO RESPOND?\n>> WELL, WE'VE SEEN -- >> WHAT DOES SHE SAY?\n>> WE'VE SEEN A COUPLE KIND OF PRACTICE RUNS, SO TO SPEAK.\nSHE WAS ASKED DURING A NEW HAMPSHIRE TOWN HALL LAST YEAR\nABOUT THIS, AND SHE SAID PEOPLE WHO -- ACCUSERS SHOULD BE\nBELIEVED UNTIL THEY'RE DISBELIEVED AND THAT WAS HOW SHE\nHANDLED IT. ALSO SHE'S TALKED ABOUT, YOU\nKNOW, PEOPLE HAVE TALKED ABOUT HER DEFENDING HER FAMILY DURING\nTHAT, AND SO I THINK SHE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO FLIP THAT AROUND\nAND TAKE A MORE -- HAVE PEOPLE SYMPATHIZE WITH HER MORE ON\nTHAT. I THINK IT'S A REALLY TOUGH ROAD\nFOR TRUMP TO GO DOWN BECAUSE SHE CAN THEN TURN THE TABLES BACK ON\nHIM AND TALK ABOUT ALL THESE OTHER THINGS GOING AROUND.\n>> YOU HAVE 30 DAYS LEFT. GIULIANI SAID WE HAVE TWO\nCANDIDATES WHO HAVE FLAWS, LET'S GET BACK TO THE ISSUES AND\nFIGURE OUT WHO IS A BETTER CANDIDATE AND WHO WILL BE A\nBETTER PRESIDENT. LAST WORD.\n>> THESE ARE TWO VERY UNPOPULAR CANDIDATES BUT WE'VE SEEN TRUMP\nSINCE THE FIRST DEBATE, SINCE THE END OF THE FIRST DEBATE, NOT\nABLE TO GET OUT FROM UNDER HIMSELF, AND I THINK THAT'S\nREALLY BEEN KEY. FOR A LOT OF THESE REPUBLICANS\nWHO ARE LEAVING, THIS INSTANCE WAS REALLY THE STRAW THAT BROKE\nTHE CAMELS BACK. THEY HAVE BEEN WATCHING THE\nCANDIDATE OVER THE PAST YEAR BUT MORE SPECIFICALLY OVER THE PAST\nWEEK REALLY FALTER AT KEY MOMENTS, AND SO I THINK IT'S\nVERY DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO REBOUND, AND THAT'S WHY I THINK\nALL EYES WILL BE WATCHING TONIGHT FOR THE FUTURE OF TRUMP\nAND ALSO THE FUTURE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\n>> KAITLYN, THANKS. REAL CLEAR POLITICS WITH US IN\nSTUDIO. I'LL BE WATCHING.\n>> YES. >> SO WILL YOU.\nBACK TO ST. LOUIS AND MORE WITH MARTHA FROM THERE.\n>> SO MUCH AT STAKE TONIGHT. GREAT POINTS THERE.\nAS WE GET READY FOR THE BIG DEBATE TONIGHT, IT IS VERY\nHIGHLY ANTICIPATED AS WE'VE ALL BEEN TALKING ABOUT, BUT NOW IT\nCOULD BE THE MOST IMPORTANT MOMENT IN THE CAMPAIGN FOR BOTH\nOF THESE CANDIDATES, AND THAT CAN JUST NOT BE OVERSTATED.\nWE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM BOTH\nOF THE CAMPAIGNS COMING UP.",

WE'RE FAMILIAR WITH HIS VOICE.\nTHE WAY HE'S ACTED ON TELEVISION BUT NEVER HEARD HIM USE THIS\nKIND OF LANGUAGE AND THE FACT HE'S NOT JUST DESCRIBING THE\nATTRACTIVENESS OF A WOMAN AND LEERING AT A WOMAN, HE'S\nDESCRIBING HIS OWN BEHAVIOR. HE'S SAYING, I DID THIS AND I'LL\nDO THIS AGAIN. THIS IS WHAT I DO WHEN I MEET\nBEAUTIFUL WOMEN. THAT'S WHAT SURPRISED ME THE\nMOST. >> WHEN YOU CONTACTED THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN FOR COMMENT AND REVEAL TO THEM WHAT YOU NOW HAD, WERE\nTHEY BLIND SIGHTED BY IT OR KNEW THIS OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS WAS\nCOMING? >> WHAT I ORIGINALLY DID WAS\nSEND THEM A TRANSCRIPT, NOT THE WHOLE VIDEO.\nWE TRANSCRIBED THE RELEVANT AND THEY SAID, IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE\nIT. AND BASICALLY CONCEDING IT WAS\nHIM AND WITH TRUMP SAYING IT WAS LOCKER ROOM TALK.\n>> DO YOU THINK THIS NOW PUTS PRESSURE ON NBC FOR THE RELEASE\nOF WHATEVER OUTTAKES MIGHT EXIST RELATIVE TO \"THE APPRENTICE\"?\n>> IT'S NOT NBC'S TO GIVE. I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT HOLLYWOOD\nAND ALL THE FOOTAGE BELONGS WITH THE PRODUCTION COMPANY, MARK\nBURNETT, THE FAMOUS PRODUCER OF \"THE APPRENTICE,\" HIS COMPANY\nAND HIS FOOTAGE. IF ANYONE WOULD RELEASE IT, IT\nHAS TO BE HIM. I DON'T THINK NBC EVEN OWNS IT.\n>> AM I RIGHT IN SAYING THAT NBC WAS AWARE OF WHAT THEY HAD ON\nTHEIR HANDS BUT YOU OUTHUSTLED THEM AND ABLE TO BEAT THEM TO\nTHE PUNCH?

I'LL LEAVE YOU HERE, MY\nMICROPHONE. OH, YOU'RE FINISHED?\n>> I'LL DO OUR SHOW. >> YOU WANT TO RESET, OKAY.\n>> HERE'S MY POINT, DAVID. HE KNEW HE WAS WEARING A\nMICROPHONE. PRESUMABLY, HE DIDN'T KNOW IT\nWAS HOT BUT HE KNEW HE HAD THAT MICROPHONE ON HIS LAPEL.\nWHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT? >> THEY HAD MIKED HIM BEFORE\nTHEY ARRIVED ON THE BUS.

TRUMP HAS CRITICIZED FORMER\nPRESIDENT BILL CLINTON FOR PAST INFIDELITY AND CRITICIZED\nOPPONENT HILLARY CLINTON AS HER HUSBAND'S ENABLER.\nWHAT ALL OF THEM MISSED IS MOST OF THE COMMENTS CAME AFTER HE\nWAS BRANDED A WOMAN HATER BY HIS OPPONENT.\nALSO, TRUMP REFRAINED FROM MENTIONING THE MARRIAGE IN THE\nLAST DEBATE. NOW, IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ANY\nFAIR-MINDED NEWS OPERATION WOULD HAVE INCLUDED THE TWO FACTS IN\nTHE ARTICLE. >> I CAN'T EVEN ASK THIS WITH A\nSTRAIGHT FACE. WHY DID YOU REPORT HIS\nWOMAN-HATING COMMENTS ALL CAME BEFORE HE WAS A CANDIDATE?\n>> I GUESS I WAS INTERESTED IN THAT PARAGRAPH TALKING ABOUT\nWHAT TRUMP HAS SAID LATELY, SINCE THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL\nDEBATE. AS BILL SAID, HE DIDN'T MENTION\nANYTHING ABOUT CLINTON'S MARRIAGE OR MUCH DURING THE\nDEBATE BUT SINCE THEN, HE'S MADE A BIG DEAL OF HOW HE COULD HAVE\nAND DID NOT AND MAYBE PLANNED TO BRING IT UP LATER.\nTHE ROLE OF HILLARY CLINTON'S MARRIAGE IN THIS CAMPAIGN HAS\nREALLY BEEN ELEVATED BY DONALD TRUMP AND ESPECIALLY IN THE LAST\nCOUPLE OF WEEKS AFTER THAT FIRST DEBATE.\nSO TO ME, THAT SEEMED THE RELEVANT CONTEXT HERE.\n>> FINAL QUESTION FOR DAVID, YOU HAVE PERFORMED ALL OF THIS\nLABORIOUS INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING PERTAINING TO TAXES\nAND THE FOUNDATION. I KNOW IT CONSUMES YOUR TIME AND\nI'M NOT DISMISSING THE AM OUNT F EFFORT IN THIS STORY BUT THIS\nVERSUS EVERYTHING YOU'VE WRITTEN THUS FAR AND THINK, WHAT?\n>> ONE BUILDS ON THE OTHER. I SPENT A LOT OF TIME WRITING\nABOUT HIS CHARITABLE GIVING, LACK THEREOF.\nTHAT BROUGHT MORE ATTENTION TO THE POST AND THE MORE VISIBILITY\nI HAVE, THE MORE PEOPLE COME TO ME WITH THINGS.\nSO ONE STORY BUILDS ON THE OTHER.\nI DON'T THINK YOU COULD HAVE HAD IT WITHOUT THE STORIES THAT HAD\nCOME BEFORE. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING\nHERE.

GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO AN\nELECTION, ONE OF THE PARTIES OR BOTH OF THE PARTIES, THEY HAVE\nWHAT THEY CALL OPPOSITION RESEARCH THAT THEY'RE WAITING TO\nUNLOAD AT THE RIGHT MOMENT. >> THEY ARE.\nAND PART OF THE RESEARCH BY OUTSIDE GROUPS FUELED BY BIG\nDOLLAR DONORS. WE ARE SEEING IT ON THE\nREPUBLICAN SIDE.

DO NOT GO OVERBOARD.\nALLOW THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND ALLOW REPUBLICANS RIGHT NOW TO\nTRY TO TAKE DOWN DONALD TRUMP.

THIS AS THE MEDIA ARE ABLAZE\nWITH DAMAGING STORIES ABOUT EACH CANDIDATE THAT ARE VIRTUALLY\nCERTAIN TO SURFACE TONIGHT. FOR TRUMP IT'S A DECADE OLD\nVIDEOTAPE THAT SHOWS HIM ENGAGING IN VULGAR TALK ABOUT\nGROPING WOMEN, THOSE WORDS CAUSING A STORM OF CRITICISM,\nEVEN AMONG SOME CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATORS AND FELLOW\nREPUBLICANS. WE WILL TALK TO THE REPORTER WHO\nBROKE THE STORY. FOR CLINTON E-MAILS DUMPED BY\nWIKILEAKS REVEALED SOME OF WHAT SHE SAID IN THOSE BIG MONEY\nBEACHES TO WALL STREET FIRMS INCLUDE NOT JUST EMBARRASSING\nPHRASES BUT POSITIONS THAT SEEM TO CONTRADICT HER PUBLIC\nPRONOUNCE MTS. WE BEGIN WITH THOSE HOT MIC\nMOMENTS FROM TRUMP'S 2005 \"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD\" TAPING WITH\nBILLY BUSH AND SOME IS GRAPHIC. >> I MOVED ON HER LIKE A\n[ BLEEP ]. I COULDN'T GET THERE AND SHE WAS\nMARRIED. ALL OF A SUDDEN I SEE HER, SHE'S\nNOW GOT THE BIG PHONEY [ BLEEP ] AND EVERYTHING, I'M\nAUTOMATICALLY ATTRACTED TO BEAUTIFUL -- IT'S LIKE A MAGNET.\nAND WHEN YOU ARE A STAR THEY LET YOU DO IT.\nYOU CAN DO ANYTHING. >> WHATEVER YOU WANT.\n>> GRAB THEM BY THE [ BLEEP ]. YOU CAN DO ANYTHING.\n>> TRUMP SAID IN AN INITIAL STATEMENT THAT HE APOLOGIZED IF\nANYONE WAS OFFENDED BUT THAT BILL CLINTON HAS SAID FAR WORSE\nTO HIM. THEN CAME THIS VIDEO.\n>> I'VE NEVER SAID I'M A PERFECT PERSON, NOR PRETENDED TO BE\nSOMEONE THAT I'M NOT. I'VE SAID AND DONE THINGS I\nREGRET AND THE WORDS RELEASED TODAY ON THIS MORE THAN A DECADE\nOLD VIDEO ARE ONE OF THEM. ANYONE WHO KNOWS ME KNOWS THESE\nWORDS DON'T REFLECT WHO I AM. I SAID IT.\nI WAS WRONG. AND I APOLOGIZE.\nTHE STORY AS HIGHLY DAMAGING. >> I HONESTLY FEEL LIKE THERE'S\nA PRETTY GOOD CHANCE WE DON'T KNOW WHO THE REPUBLICAN\nCANDIDATE IS FOR PRESIDENT BY THE END OF THIS WEEKEND.\n>> WILL THIS KILL HIS CAMPAIGN? >> I THINK THIS COULD BE IT.\n>> NOBODY IS GOING TO DEFEND THIS.\nYOU CAN'T DEFEND. IT IS WRONG, IT IS\nINAPPROPRIATE, IT IS OUTRAGEOUS. >> JOINING US NOW TO ANALYZE THE\nCOVERAGE OF THE TRUMP AND CLINTON STORIES AS WELL AS\nTONIGHT'S BIG DEBATE JULIE ROGINSKY FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR\nAND A DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, TUCKER CARLSON CO-HOST OF \"FOX\nAND FRIENDS\" WEEKEND AND EDITOR OF THE DAILY CALLER AND HEIDI\nPRZYBYLA SENIOR POLITICAL REPORTER AT \"USA TODAY.\"\n>> TUCKER, YOU HAVE A NUCLEAR EXPLOSION IN THE MEDIA OVER A\nDECADE OLD TAPE, REPUBLICANS BALING RIGHT AND LEFT.\nTHE WORDS ARE DISTURBING, THEY ARE INDEFENSIBLE, BUT I WAS\nWATCHING CNN AND MSNBC, IT'S ON HOUR AFTER HOUR.\nIS THE NEWS BUSINESS OVERPLAYING THIS JUST A BIT?\n>> THE WORDS ARE INDEFENSIBLE THEY ARE NOT INEXPLICABLE.\nNOBODY IS ACTUALLY SHOCKED BY THIS AND EVERYONE IS PRETENDING\nTO BE. >> MANUFACTURED OUTRAGE.\n>> ENTIRELY MANUFACTURED. THIS WAS ONE OF THE RECURRING\nGUESTS ON THE HOWARD STERN SHOW. THIS IS DONALD TRUMP.\nSO EVERYONE KNEW THAT TRUMP IS CAPABLE OF THIS.\nEVERYONE WHO KNOWS TRUMP KNOWS HE SPEAKS LIKE THIS IN REAL\nLIFE, NOT THIS EXTREME BUT IN THE BALLPARK.\nONE THE PRESS HAS NO MORAL STANDING TO JUDGE ANYONE WHO\nTALKS LIKE THIS HAVING SPENT 25 YEARS IN NEWS ROOMS.\n>> YOU HAVE HEARD PLENTY OF LOCKER ROOM TALK.\n>> I HAVE. THE OTHER POINT IS IT'S\nMISLEADING TO PRETEND TRUMP IS BEING ABANDONED BY THE\nREPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP BECAUSE THEY ARE SO OUTRAMD.\nJOHN McCAIN IS NOT PULLING HIS SUPPORT OF TRUMP BECAUSE HE'S\nOFFENDED, IT'S BECAUSE HE THINKS IT HURTS HIM POLITICALLY.\n>> JULIE ROGINSKY, TUCKER IS SAYING HARDLY SHOCKING, WE HAVE\nHEARD THE WHOLE HOWARD STERN INTERVIEWS AND SO A LOT OF THIS\nIS JUST WHIPPED UP FROM PEOPLE IN THE MEDIA AND POLITICS WHO DO\nNOT LIKE DONALD TRUMP. >> I AGREE WITH TUCKER ON ALMOST\nEVERYTHING. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN\nLOCKER ROOM TALK THAT TUCKER WAS PRIVY TO IS DONALD TRUMP IS NOT\nJUST TALKING ABOUT THE SIZE OF SOMEBODY'S BREASTS HE IS\nACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT, HE IS GOING UP TO WOMEN\nAND GRABBING THEM BY THEIR PRIVATE PARTS IN WAYS THAT I\nTHINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD CONSTRUE AS AN UNWANTED SEXUAL ASSAULT.\nSO WHEN IT COMES TO THAT, THAT'S WHERE THE LAWN IS DRAWN.\nLISTEN, I AGREE WITH TUCKER 100%, JOHN McCAIN IS NOT BALING\nBECAUSE ALL OF A SUDDEN WE FIND THAT DONALD TRUMP IS VULGAR.\nTHEY'RE BALING BECAUSE OF POLITICS.\nFOR A LOT OF WOMEN THIS ISN'T ABOUT JUST THE LOCKER ROOM TALK,\nIT'S ACTUALLY ABOUT THE FACT THIS LOCKER ROOM TALK\nCONSTITUTES SOMETHING PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH AS ASSAULT.\n>> I'M NOT TRYING TO MINIMIZE THIS OR DEFEND IT OR MAKE\nEXCUSES FOR IT I'M MERELY SAYING IT CAME FROM DONALD TRUMP AND\nEVERYONE KNEW HE WAS CAPABLE OF THIS.\nTHAT'S THE ONLY POINT I'M SAYING.\n>> INTERESTING THAT YOU USED THE WORD PRIVATE PARTS BECAUSE THE P\nWORD WHICH WE HAVE BLEEPED CNN JUST SHOWED THE TAPE AND SHOWED\nTHE P WORD AND S WORDS AND \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" PRINTED IT.\n>> HEIDI PRZYBYLA, EVEN IF PEOPLE ARE SAYING THIS IS MEDIA\nBIAS, YOU DON'T LIKE DONALD TRUMP, YOU ALSO HAVE THE\nEXPLOSIVE REACTION TO THIS WHOLE TAPE, YOU KNOW, REINCE PRIEBUS\nAND KELLYANNE CONWAY BOWING OUT OF THE SUNDAY SHOWS, MIKE PENCE\nNOT MAKING A TRIP SAYING HE CAN'T DEFEND IT, TRUMP'S WIFE\nSAYING THIS IS OFFENSIVE BUT ACCEPTS HIS APOLOGY.\nHUGH HEWITT AND BILL BENNETT SAYING HE SHOULD DROP OUT OF THE\nRACE. IN PART IS THE PRESS COVERING\nTHE REACTION TO THIS EVEN IF IT'S AN OVERREACTION?\n>> ABSOLUTELY. GRANTED, TUCKER IS ABSOLUTELY\nRIGHT THAT A LOT OF THESE REPUBLICANS WHO ARE BALING HAVE\nBEEN CRITICAL OF TRUMP ALL ALONG, BUT A LOT OF THEM\nHAVEN'T. LIKE BILL BENNETT WHO HAD BEEN\nOUT THERE ESSENTIALLY SPEAKING -- TALKING UP TRUMP,\nLIKE DEB FISCHER IN THE SENATE. THERE'S REALLY ONLY ONE FEMALE\nGOP SENATOR WHO HASN'T CALLED FOR HIM TO STEP ASIDE WHICH IS\nJONI ERNST. SO I'M HARD PRESSED AS ARE ALL\nOF THE POLITICAL COMMENT CATERS TO COME UP WITH ANY KIND OF A\nHISTORICAL PRECEDENT FOR WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE PAST 48\nHOURS. NOT ONLY JUST IN TERMS OF THE\nLEWD COMMENTS THAT ARE ALSO FRANKLY PREDATORY IN NATURE, BUT\nALSO JUST IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING WITH THIS CIVIL WAR\nERUPTING IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WITH REPUBLICANS DOWN THE BALLOT\nNOW AS WELL PANICKING AND IT IS RELEVANT AND IT IS SIGNIFICANT\nTO PLAY THIS UP BECAUSE THIS COMES AT A TIME WHEN IT APPEARED\nACCORDING TO THE POLLS THAT TRUMP WAS REALLY CONSOLIDATING\nTHE GOP BASE FOR ALL OF THE RANKER THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE\nTHROUGHOUT THE PRIMARY, HE WAS CONSOLIDATING.\n>> LET ME COME BACK TO YOU ON THIS, TUCKER.\nA COUPLE TRUMP TWEETS, THE MEDIA AND THE ESTABLISHMENT WANT ME\nOUT OF THIS RACE SO BADLY, HE SAID HE'S NOT DROPPING OUT, HE\nALSO TOLD THE \"WASHINGTON POST\" AND \"WALL STREET JOURNAL.\"\nSO MANY SELF RIGHTEOUS HIP RITZ. MY QUESTION IS YOU SAY THERE IS\nA LOT OF HYPOCRISY IN THE NEWS BUSINESS.\nIS THERE GOING TO BE A GAP BETWEEN THE PUBLIC WHICH MAY --\nSOME OF WHOM MAY NOT LIKE THIS AT ALL AND SOME OF WHOM MAY\nTHINK THAT THIS IS JUST, YOU KNOW, TRUMP SHOWING OFF WITH\nBOYS WILL BE BOYS, AND THE PUNDITS WHO ARE SAYING -- WHO\nARE ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT WHETHER HE COULD BE REPLACED AS\nA REPUBLICAN NOMINEE? >> LOOK, I DON'T THINK ANYBODY\nLIKES WHAT TRUMP SAID, IT'S GROSS.\nI MEAN, IT'S DISGUSTING. ON THE OTHER HAND THERE COULD BE\nA RUBBER BAND EFFECT WHERE THE OUTRAGE IS SO PHONEY AND SO\nOVERDONE THAT SOME PEOPLE SAY KNOCK IT OFF.\nI DISLIKE YOU MORE THAN I'M OFFENDED BY TRUMP.\nI WOULD JUST SAY THIS, HERE IS THE DISHONESTY IS THAT THE\nPEOPLE WHO ARE OPPOSING TRUMP NOW HAVE REAL REASONS TO OPPOSE\nHIM, I THINK, THEY ARE TOTALLY LEGITIMATE BUT THEY'RE\nPREEXISTING, THE SAME PEOPLE ABANDONING HIM NOW DIDN'T WANT\nHIM TO BE THE NOMINEE. THEY HAVE PREEXISTING REASONS\nFOR OPPOSING HIM AND THAT'S FINE BUT WE SHOULD JUST BE HONEST\nABOUT IT. >> JULIE, LET ME READ YOU\nEXCERPTS FROM THE COVERAGE, CNN SAID IT'S OVER FOR HIM, HE IS\nLIKE SOME CENTRAL AMERICAN DICTATOR.\n\"POLITICO,\" NO CANDIDATE HAS ENTERED A DEBATE SO CLOAKED IN\nDISGRACE, \"NEW YORK TIMES\" THIS TURNED A BORISH MAN INTO AN\nOUTRIGHT PREDATOR. I HAVE THE IMPRESSION THERE IS A\nLOT OF GLEE IN THIS, A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE MEDIA WHO NEVER\nLIKED TRUMP, SAID HE WAS NEVER GOING TO WIN THE NOMINATION\nWOULD KIND OF LIKE THE, QUOTE, VIKTS RI OF SEEING HIM PUSHED\nOUT OF THE RACE. >> THERE'S TWO THINGS GOING ON\nAND THEN I WILL MAKE A PERSONAL OBSERVATION.\nONE IS TRUMP IS A COMPLETE CREATION OF THE MEDIA.\n>> NO, HE IS NOT. >> HE IS, I'M SORRY --\n>> HE GOT MILLIONS OF REPUBLICANS VOTES.\n>> HE DID BECAUSE THE MEDIA RODE THIS HORSE ALL THE WAY TO THE\nNOMINATION, THEY COVERED HIS PRESS CONFERENCES, THEY NEVER\nBROKE TO GO TO TED CRUZ'S PRESS CONFERENCES HE.\n>> HE GAVE MORE INTERVIEWS THAN THE HISTORY OF ANYONE IN\nTELEVISION. >> THEY DIDN'T BREAK FOR TED\nCRUZ OR MARCO RUBIO OR JEB BUSH, THEY DID IT FOR TRUMP BECAUSE\nHIS RATINGS WERE GOOD AND THEY WERE GOOD BECAUSE HE WOULD SAY\nCRAZY STUFF AND PEOPLE WANTED TO TUNE IN.\nTHAT'S ONE. TWO I WILL SAY TO YOU THAT\nREPORTERS LOVE NOTHING BETTER THAN TO BUILD SOMEBODY UP AND\nTEAR THEM DOWN AND THAT'S A FACT.\nTO SOME EXTENT YOU HAVE A POINT THERE.\n>> ON THAT ONE I AGREE WITH YOU. >> THE THIRD OBSERVATION I WOULD\nMAKE IS AS A WOMAN WE ALL KNOW THIS GUY.\nIT MAY NOT BE A BIG DEAL TO MALE REPORTERS, EVERY WOMAN OUT THERE\nKNOWS THIS KIND",

AS ONE OF YOUR EARLIER GUESTS\nSAYS HE'S NOT COMMENTING ON A WOMAN'S ATTRACTIVENESS HE'S\nDESCRIBING HIS OWN BEHAVIOR, WEATHER TRUTHFULLY OR NOT, I\nDON'T KNOW, HE'S SAYING THIS IS WHAT I DID, THIS IS WHAT I DO.\nI THINK THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT WORSE.\n>> NOW, YOU HAVE BROKEN MOST OF THE STORIES ABOUT FINANCES OF\nTHE TRUMP FOUNDATION LEADING NEW YORK'S ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO IS A\nDEMOCRAT AND BIG HILLARY SUPPORTER TO RECENTLY BRING A\nTEMPORARILY HALT AT LEAST TO THE FOUNDATION'S FUNDRAISING.\nTHE CAMPAIGN NOT THAT LONG AGO DESCRIBED YOU AS A BIASED REPORT\nWHO IS CLEARLY INTENT ON DISTRACTING ATTENTION AWAY FROM\nTHE CORRUPT CLINTON FOUNDATION.

IN THE CASE OF TRUMP THIS IS A\nGUY WHO IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, WHEN YOU DO THAT YOU\nOPEN YOURSELF UP TO SCRUTINY AND THE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TRUMP\nFOUNDATION IT'S PARTICULARLY THE PARTICULAR FAILURE THAT LED TO\nTHIS ORDER FROM AG SNYDERMAN, THIS IS NOT GOING THAT SNYDERMAN\nFOUND AND BROUGHT TO ME IT WAS SOMETHING I FOUND THAT WAS\nPOINTED OUT TO ME BY A LAW PROFESSOR WHEN I WAS WORKING ON\nANOTHER STORY. IT'S THE EASIEST THING THAT\nTRUMP COULD HAVE DONE -- IT'S A PAPERWORK ERROR, IT'S NOT\nSOMETHING THAT REQUIRED A LOT OF SLEUTHING, ONCE YOU KNEW THE LAW\nIT WAS EASY TO SEE TRUMP SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS AND IN FACT DID\nNOT. >> I'VE GOT JUST A COUPLE\nSECONDS.

THE FIRST WE HAVE SEEN SINCE THE\nVIDEOTAPE DROPPED 24 HOURS AGO. YOU WOULDN'T KNOW HIS CAMPAIGN\nIS IN CRISIS MODE AFTER THE LEWD, VULGAR AND SEXUALLY\nAGGRESSIVE REMARKS MADE A DECADE AGO.\nPEOPLE CLOSE TO THE HILLARY CLINTON CAMP TELL US YOU WILL\nNOT HEAR A WORD FROM HER ABOUT ALL OF THIS UNTIL SHE TAKES THE\nDEBATE STAGE TOMORROW NIGHT IN ST. LOUIS.\n>> THAT IS WHEN AND WHERE SHE WILL ADDRESS WHAT DONALD TRUMP\nSAID. SHE WILL DO IT ACCORDING TO\nCAMPAIGN, WE ARE HEARING EARLY ON IN THE DEBATE TOMORROW NIGHT.\nTWO POLITICAL CNN COMMENTATORS WITH ME.\nPATTY DOYLE, HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER, THE INSIDER,\nANDY DEAN, FORMER PRESIDENT OF TRUMP PRODUCTIONS AND A DONALD\nTRUMP SUPPORTER. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.\nPATTY TAKE ME INTO THE MIND OF SECRETARY CLINTON.\nWE KNOW SHE WILL ADDRESS THIS TOMORROW NIGHT ON STAGE.\nSHE WILL DO IT EARLY REMEMBER WHAT WILL SHE SAY?\n>> I THINK THE PRESSURE WAS ON DONALD TRUMP BEFORE THIS\nHAPPENED FOR HIM TO REALLY PERFORM AND KNOCK THE DEBATE OUT\nOF THE PARK. OBVIOUSLY, IT'S EVEN MORE SO\nNOW. FOR HILLARY CLINTON, SHE HAS TO\nCONDEMN DONALD TRUMP IN THE STRONGEST WORDS POSSIBLE.\nTHIS IS A WOMAN WHO HAS DEVOTED HER ADULT LIFE FOR FIGHTING FOR\nWOMEN AND FAMILIES. SHEET DONE IT ON THE\nINTERNATIONAL STAGE. SHE'S DONE IT DOMESTIC AMY.\nSHE'S FOUGHT FOR EQUALITY FOR WOMEN, ECONOMICALLY,\nPOLITICALLY, SOCIALLY, AND SO SHE'S ALMOST AN ICON FOR WOMEN\nIN THIS COUNTRY, SO SHE NEEDS TO CONDEMN HIM.\nTHAT'S HER ONE AND ONLY PRIORITY TOMORROW NIGHT.\n>> I THINK AS FAR AS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN SAYING, IF ARE YOU\nTHIS PARAGONE OF VIRTUE FOR WOMEN, WHY DOES THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION ACCEPT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM MIDDLE EASTERN\nCOUNTRIES WHERE WOMEN ARE HORRIBLY ABUSED.\n>> ARE YOU MAKING AN EQUIVALENCY WHAT THE:T FOUNDATION TAKES FOR\nDONATIONS TO IN SOME WAY EXCUSING WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAID?\n>> NO, THERE IS NO EQUIVALENCY. >> WHAT ITSELF THE POINT YOU ARE\nMAKING?

I KNOW YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THE\nCOMMENTS. >> NO, I DON'T.\nTRUMP DOESN'T AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS.\nTHEY WERE VERY ROUGH OVER COMMENTS.\nBUT AT THE SAME TIME, WHILE THEY WERE MADE 11 YEARS AGO, HE WAS\nON A MICK, A HOT MIC, THAT DOESN'T EXCUSE IT, I'M\nEXPLAINING HE DIDN'T REALIZE HE WAS BEING RECORDED.\nTHAT'S AWFUL. THESE WERE 11 YEARS AGO.\nWHAT I'M SAYING. >> HE WAS 59 YEARS OLD.\n>> YOU CAN MAKE IT SEEM. >> HE WAS 59-YEARS-OLD.\n>> YOU CAN REPLACE CLIPS ON HOWARD STERN AND SAY IT'S\nBREAKING NEWS EVERY DAY FOR THE NEXT 31 DAYS T. VOTERS, THIS IS\nTHE KEY PIECE. THE VOTERS KNOW THAT TRUMP CAN\nSOMETIMES SPEAK IN A WAY THAT IS VULGAR, THEY KNEW THAT A\nYEAR-AND-A-HALF AGO, THIS IS A PART OF THE PRIMARY PROCESS WHAT\nI'M SAYING IS HAPPENING HERE. >> HERE'S WHAT'S DIFFERENT.\nRIGHT. IT'S NOT JUST VULGAR.\n>> WE GET IT. IT'S INUP SULTING.\n>> IT'S NOT JUST JULY GAR AND INSULTING.\nIT'S SEXUALLY AGGRESSIVE AND PREDATORY.\n>> TALKING ABOUT A POSITION OF POWER TO GRAB A FEMALE'S\nGENITALS. >> THERE IS A DIFFERENCE.\nWE ALL AGREE THAT IS HORRIBLE T. PART YOU ARE IGNORING HERE, WHEN\nYOU COVER EVERY EIGHT MINUTES THAT PEOPLE SAY DONALD TRUMP\nSHOUM STEP DOWN IS THIS IS A LOT BIGGER THAN DONALD TRUMP.\n>> HIS OWN PARTY MEMBERS. >> THE ESTABLISHMENT TO BEGIN\nWITH, LET ME FINISH MY POINT HERE, THIS IS MUCH BIGGER THAN\nDONALD TRUMP.

WE CAN GET INTO THAT LATER.\nBUT TRUMP'S TAXES, NOW THIS CONTROVERSY OF INAPPROPRIATE\nTHINGS. WE KNEW THAT A YEAR AGO, AN\nAUGUST 6th, MR. TRUMP, YOU SAY INAPPROPRIATE THINGS T. VOTERS\nUNDERSTOOD THAT, WE DON'T AGREE WITH IT.\nWE WANT A STRONGER SOCIETY. HE IS VERY IMPERFECT.\n>> YOU WILL BE WITH ME ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS BREAK.\nPATTY WILL BE IN HERE. MUCH MORE FROM WALK UNIVERSITY\nT. SITE OF TOMORROW NIGHT'S DEBATE COMING UP.\nBUT FIRST, WE HAVE TO JUMP TO THIS.\nTHIS WEEK, CNN'S HERO, WE WANT YOU TO METE JEFF PAYNE.\n>> A LOT OF PARENTS WOULD NOT TOSS THEIR KIDS A GUN AND TELL\nTHEM TO HAVE FUN. MANY DON'T THINK TWICE OF\nTHROWING THE DHAR KEYS. WE THROW THEM OUT ON THE ROAD\nAND BE PREPARED TO HANDLE EVERY SITUATION.\nTHAT'S JUST NOT THE CASE. WE'RE DOING OUR JOB TO MAKE A\nDIFFERENCE AND MAKE THE ROADS SAFER FOR ALL OF US.\n>> ALL RIGHT. WE HAVE TO GET A BREAK IF.               Mom,",

THERE WAS NO CONTRITION.\nI JUST THINK IT'S BEEN HANDLED THUS FAR VERY BADLY.\n>> JEFFREY, I'VE SPOKEN TO SOME REPUBLICANS WHO POINT OUT THAT\nTHEIR FRUSTRATION OVER THIS VIDEOTAPE, WHAT DONALD TRUMP\nSAID BEING RELEASED WHEN IT WAS JUST AS WIKILEAKS RELEASING THE\nTRANSCRIPTS OF HILLARY CLINTON'S SPEECHES BEFORE MAJOR WALL\nSTREET LAW FIRMS FOR WHICH SHE WAS PAID A LOT AND THAT STORY IS\nBASICALLY BURIED. >> RIGHT.\n>> AS A RESULT OF DONALD TRUMP'S WORDS AS THEY'VE COME FORWARD\nAND THEY'RE BLAMING HIM DIRECTLY FOR WHAT THEY SEE THIS DISASTER.\n>> WELL, I MEAN, THIS WAS 11 YEARS AGO, WOLF.\n>> BUT THAT'S NOT JUST THAT BUT PATTY SAYS THE WAY HE'S HANDLED\nIT, THEY SEE IT AS A DISASTER AND WOULD HAVE LIKED FOR HIM TO\nIMMEDIATELY COME OUT WITH CONTRITION TO APOLOGIZE, TO\nAPOLOGIZE DIRECTLY TO THE WOMEN HE INSULTED IN THAT VIDEOTAPE.\nHE STILL HASN'T DONE THIS. >> WELL, I THINK HE'S GOTTEN THE\nBALL ROLLING ON THIS. I MEAN, WOLF, TRULY, I THINK\nTHAT THERE ARE A LOT OF AMERICANS OUT THERE THAT LOOK AT\nHOW THIS CAME TO LIGHT, A LEAK FROM THE MEDIA, THE COVERAGE OF\nTHE MEDIA, AND THEN YOU GET THE ELITIST POLITICIANS, YOU KNOW,\nFLEEING THE SHIP HERE.

I THOUGHT I SAW GOVERNOR\nSCHWARZENEGGER MENTIONED. LET'S JUST REMEMBER THAT A FEW\nDAYS BEFORE HIS ELECTION AS GOVERN NOR OF CALIFORNIA FIRST\nTIME SOMETHING VERY MUCH LIKE THIS CAME FORWARD FROM THE \"LOS\nANGELES TIMES\" EPA YET HE WOUND UP WINNING IN A LANDSLIDE.\n>> WHAT DOES TRUMP NEED TO DO? >> TOMORROW'S DEBATE IS CRUCIAL.\n>> WHAT DOES HE NEED TO DO THERE?\n>> HE HAS TO COME OUT AND EXPRESS GENUINE CONTRITION, LOOK\nIN THE CAMERA SAYING, LOOK, I UNDERSTAND I HURT A LOT OF\nPEOPLE. I'M SORRY.\nNOT QUALIFY AS AN ATTACK ON BILL CLINTON AND HILLARY CLINTON.\nJUST APOLOGIZE AND THEN MOVE INTO TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUES.\nTHE STRONGEST POINT OF LAST DEBATE IS FIRST 20 MINUTES LIKE\nTRADE AND THE ECONOMY AND WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO AND NOT JUST\nSAYING, LOOK, I'LL ATTACK BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON FOR THE\nPERSONAL PAST. DOESN'T WORK.\n>> CAN HE DO THAT? >> HE HAS NOT PROVEN TO BE A\nDISCIPLINED POLITICIAN. I DON'T KNOW IF HE CAN DO THAT\nWHAT HILLARY NEEDS TO DO IS COME OUT FIERCE.\nCOME OUT AN CONDEMN DONALD TRUMP IN THE STRONGEST WORDS SHE'S\nEVER USED. SHE NEEDS TO STAND UP FOR THE\nWOMEN THAT HE HAS INSULTED. THESE WOMEN HE'S OFFENDED.\nI THINK SHE'S GOING TO STAND UP FOR NANCY O'DELL.\n>> WE HAVE A LOT MORE TO DISCUSS.\nQUICK PROGRAMMING NOTE, THE DEMOCRATIC VICE PRESIDENTIAL\nNOMINEE SENATOR TIM KAINE AND GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE, ONE OF\nDONALD TRUMP'S TOP ADVISERS, WILL BE AMONG JAKE TAPPER'S\nGUESTS ON \"STATE OF THE UNION.\" WATCH TOMORROW MORNING 9:00 A.M.\nEASTERN.

BUT WHEN YOU GO TO THE POLLS,\nYOU HAVE TO LOOK AT BOTH CANDIDATES AND DO THIS WITH\nEVERY ELECTION AND WRITE DOWN PROS AND CONS AND DECIDE WHICH\nCANDIDATE YOU LIKE THE BEST. IF YOU LOOK AT HILLARY'S RECORD,\nYOU CAN'T FORGET BENGHAZI, THERE ARE FOUR PEOPLE THAT ARE DEAD\nPLEADING FOR HELP AND MORE SECURITY AND SHE DIDN'T PROVIDE\nTHAT. YOU CAN TALK ABOUT HER E-MAIL\nSCANDAL AND HER LYING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ABOUT THAT.\nYOU HAVE TO LOOK AT BOTH CANDIDATES AND GO TO THE POLLS\nAND MAKE YOUR OWN DECISIONS. >> THERE'S STORIES THERE'S\nAPPRENTICE TAPES FAR WORSE THAN THE ACCESS HOLLYWOOD TAPES.\nYOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THIS IS GOING.\n>> LESS THAN 12 HOURS AWAY. >> RIGHT.\n>> BOTH CANDIDATES DEALING WITH THE BRAND-NEW SCANDALS AHEAD OF\nTHE DEBATE.

WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT?\n>> I DON'T THINK ANYBODY PROVED THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN WAS BEHIND\nTHE LATEST VIDEO WHICH WE ALL AGREE HAS BEEN PRETTY DESPICABLE\nAND JUST TOTALLY BEYOND THE PALE, BUT IT SPEAKS TO THE\nCANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN FROM THE DAY HE STEPPED IN THIS\nRACE WHERE HE CALLED MEXICANS RAPISTS AND ATTACKS THE JUDGE\nBECAUSE OF HIS MEXICAN HERITAGE.

THIS IS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS, AND\nI DON'T THINK THAT ANYBODY WHO IS OUT THERE WHO IS THINKING\nABOUT WHO THEY'RE GOING TO SUPPORT IN THIS ELECTION THINKS\nTHAT THAT'S THE PERSON THEY WANT TO BE COMMANDER IN CHIEF --\n>> WHAT WOULD YOU ADVISE TONIGHT?\nIF DONALD TRUMP DOES COME OUT AND BRING UP THINGS LIKE BILL\nCLINTON'S SEXUAL PAST WITH MONICA LEWINSKY, THE OVAL\nOFFICE, ALL OF THAT STUFF, JUANITA BRODERICK, PAULA JONES,\nWHAT WOULD YOU ADVISE HER TO SAY?\n>> SECRETARY CLINTON WILL SPEAK FOR HERSELF.\nIF DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO CONTINUE KEEPING HIS CAMPAIGN IN\nTHE GUTTER, THAT'S UP TO HIM. I THINK SECRETARY CLINTON WILL\nCONTINUE DOING WHAT SHE'S BEEN DOING SINCE DAY ONE, TALKING\nABOUT ISSUES, TALKING ABOUT SOLUTIONS, SPEAKING TO THE\nVOTERS DIRECTLY. THAT'S WHAT A TOWN HALL FORMAT\nACTUALLY IS PERFECT FOR, EXPRESSING YOUR VISION,\nEXPRESSING HOW YOU'RE GOING TO GOVERN AND THAT'S WHAT THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GOING TO RESPOND TO TONIGHT.\n>> WHAT ABOUT",

JOHN, I PROMISE WE'LL GET TO THE\nTRUMP TAPE IN A MOMENT. FIRST WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT\nTHESE HACKED E-MAILS FROM YOUR PRIVATE ACCOUNT TO GO BACK IN\nTIME, LET'S HEAR WHAT HILLARY CLINTON WAS TELLING VOTERS IN\nNEW HAMPSHIRE LAST FEBRUARY. >> ANYBODY WHO KNOWS ME, WHO\nTHINKS THAT HEAD CAN INFLUENCE ME, NAME ANYTHING THEY'VE\nINFLUENCED ME ON. NAME ONE THING.\nI'M OUT HERE EVERY DAY SAYING I'M GOING TO SHUT THEM DOWN, I'M\nGOING AFTER THEM. I'M GOING TO JAIL THEM IF THEY\nSHOULD BE JAILED.

HOW DO WE FIGURE OUT WHAT WORKS\nAND THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW THE INDUSTRY BETTER THAN ANYBODY ARE\nTHE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THE INDUSTRY.\nJOHN, WHAT IS HER REAL VIEW? CRACKDOWN ON BIG MONEY OR KISS\nUP TO THEM? >> WELL, CHRIS, I THINK WE\nSHOULD TAKE A STEP BACK AND SAY HOW WE GOT HERE WHICH IS THAT\nTHE RUSSIANS AND THE U.S. SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT HAVE\nBEEN HACKING INTO DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTS AND NOW THEY'VE HACKED\nINTO MY ACCOUNT, PUT OUT A DOCUMENTS PURPORTED TO BE FROM\nMY ACCOUNT BUT I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT SHE SAID IN THIS\nCAMPAIGN TO GET TO YOUR QUESTION, I WOULD JUST ADD, YOU\nKNOW, THIS SHOULD BE OF CONCERN TO EVERYONE THAT THE RUSSIANS\nARE TRYING TO INFLUENCE OUR ELECTION.\nI'LL ANSWER YOUR QUESTION DIRECTLY WHICH IS THAT SHE SAID\nALL THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN SHE WILL CRACKDOWN ON WALL STREET.\nTHERE IS NOTHING THAT SHE HASN'T SAID IN PRIVATE THAT SHE DOESN'T\nSAY IN PUBLIC. SHE HAS PUT FORWARD THE MOST\nAGGRESSIVE WALL STREET PLAN OF ANY CANDIDATE, REALLY.\nSHE STANDS BEHIND FRANK. DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO RIP IT\nAWAY. SHE WON'T LET WALL STREET --\n>> JOHN, WHAT ARE WE TO MAKE OF THE FACT THAT SHE SAYS IN\nPRIVATE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW THE INDUSTRY BEST IN TERMS OF\nREGULATION ARE THE PEOPLE WHO WORK ON WALL STREET?\n>> THAT IS HARDLY A REVELATION. I MEAN, I THINK PEOPLE ON WALL\nSTREET KNOW HOW TO GAME THE SYSTEM.\nWHAT SHE WANTS TO DO IS CRACKDOWN ON THE SYSTEM, MAKE\nSURE THERE IS NO INSTITUTION TOO BIG TO FAIL AND NO PERSON TOO\nBIG TO JAIL. I THINK SHE PUT FORWARD VERY\nCOMPREHENSIVE IDEAS ABOUT THAT, HOW TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF BIG\nBANKS AND THAT IS WHY BREAKING NEWS YESTERDAY, AFTER LOOKING AT\nTHE TRANSCRIPTS SAID HE STANDS BEHIND HER, WHAT THEY WORKED\nTOGETHER TO PRODUCE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PLATFORM AND THAT IS\nWHAT SHE WILL DO AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\n>> WELL, THE QUESTION, IT IS SORT OF LIKE WHAT DONALD TRUMP\nSAYS. HE IS THE ONE TO HANDLE THE TAX\nSYSTEM BECAUSE HE KNOWS HOW TO GAME IT.\nLET ME ASK YOU ABOUT ANOTHER ONE.\nDURING THE CAMPAIGN, CLINTON HAS TAKEN A TOUGH LINE ON BOTH TRADE\nAND ON IMMIGRATION, BUT HERE IS WHAT SHE SAID IN A BIG MONEY\nSPEECH TO A BRAZILIAN BANK. MY DREAM IS A HEMISPHERIC COMMON\nMARKET WITH OPEN TRADE AND OPEN BORDERS, THINK ABOUT WHAT\nDOUBLING THE TRADE BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND LATIN AMERICA\nWOULD MEAN FOR EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM.\nJOHN? >> OPEN TRADE?\nOPEN BORDERS? >> YOU CAN PLUCK A FEW WORDS, IF\nTHAT IS WHAT SHE DID SAY OUT OF CONTEXT BUT I THINK, AGAIN, SHE\nPUT FORWARD AND HAS BEEN FOR AND IS CONSTANTLY, YOU KNOW,\nCHAMPIONS AND VOTED FOR COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM\nTHAT MODERNIZED OUR BORDER SECURITY.\nSHE, WHEN SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE, SHE TALKED ABOUT CREATING\nA HEMISPHERIC EFFORT TO BRING CLEAN ENERGY ACROSS THE\nCONTINENTS FROM THE TIP OF SOUTH AMERICA TO CANADA TO INVEST IN\nCLEAN AND RENEWABLE ENERGY, TO INVEST IN THE TRANSMISSION THAT\nWOULD CLEAN UP OUR ENERGY SYSTEM AND YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT SHE\nCONSTANTLY TALKED ABOUT THAT. SHE HAD AN INITIATIVE WHEN SHE\nWAS SECRETARY OF STATE TO DO THAT.\nYOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE CONTEXT OF SOME OF THE REMARKS.\n>> JOHN -- >> WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT SHE\nSAID ABOUT IMMIGRATION. SHE IS FOR COMPREHENSIVE\nIMMIGRATION REFORM THAT TAKES PEOPLE OUT OF THE SHADOWS,\nEMPHASIZES FAMILY UNITY BUT ALSO HAS MODERNIZES ON THE BORDER\nSECURITY. >> JOHN, THIS GETS TO THE HEART,\nTHIS GETS TO THE HEART OF PEOPLE'S CONCERNS ABOUT HILLARY\nCLINTON. I WANT TO TAKE AN EXCERPT FROM\nANOTHER ONE OF THE SPEECHES, YOU NEED A PUBLIC AND PRIVATE\nPOSITION. THE QUESTION IS WHEN YOU SEE THE\nSPEECHES, AND THEN YOU SEE WHAT SHE IS SAYING ON THE CAMPAIGN.\nTHEY'RE OPPOSED. WHAT IS HER REAL POSITION.\n>> THEY'RE NOT OPPOSED, CHRIS, I THINK SHE TALKED ABOUT INCOME\nAND EQUALITY, TO WALL STREET, SHE SAID WE NEED TO CLOSE THE\nCARRIED INTEREST LOOPHOLES. SHE SAID EVEN AS EARLY AS 2008\nTHAT WHAT THEY WERE DOING WITH CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS AND THE\nHOUSING MARKET WAS GOING TO WRECK THE ECONOMY, WHICH IT DID.\nSHE HAS BEEN TOUGH WITH THEM WHEN SHE WAS A SENATOR FROM NEW\nYORK. THAT IS WHAT SHE HAS DONE.\nTHEY'RE NOT OPPOSED. WHAT SHE SAID ON THIS CAMPAIGN\nTRAIL WAS SHE WILL BE TOUGH ON WALL STREET AND THAT IS EXACTLY\nWHAT SHE WILL DO. >> ALL RIGHT.\nWE'VE GOTTEN A LITTLE BIT OF TIME REMAINING.\nYOU'VE BEEN VERY PATIENT. YOUR REACTION TO THE TRUMP TAPE.\n>> WELL, MY REACTION IS IT IS DISGUSTING AND I THINK PEOPLE\nSAW IN REAL LIFE WHAT WE'VE BEEN SAYING FOR A LONG TIME WHEN\nHILLARY SAID AS FAR BACK IN JUNE WAS HE IS UNFIT TO BE PRESIDENT\nOF THE UNITED STATES. YOU SEE REPUBLICANS LEAVING THEM\nIN DROVES. THERE ARE REPUBLICANS WHO SAID\nHE SHOULD EITHER WITHDRAW, THEY WON'T VOTE FOR HIM, JUST SINCE\nFRIDAY, SO I THINK HE WILL HAVE EXPLAINING HIMSELF TO DO\nTONIGHT. YOU KNOW, THIS IS AN EXCEPTION.\nHE SAID THE SAME HORRIBLE THINGS ABOUT LATINOS.\nABOUT AFRICAN-AMERICANS, ABOUT MUSLIMS, HE HAS MADE FUN OF A\nREPORTER WITH A DISABILITY. THIS IS WHO THIS GUY IS AND I\nTHINK THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE JUST HEARD AND SAW FROM\nTHEMSELVES IN GRAPHIC DETAIL WHICH, I HOPE VOTER ACTUALLY\nTAKES THE TIME TO SEE WHAT IS REALLY ON THAT TAPE AND I HOPE\nALL OF THEIR CHILDREN DON'T GET TO SEE WHAT IS ON THAT TAPE.\n>> JOHN PODESTA, THANK YOU, THANKS FOR JOINING US TODAY AND\nOF COURSE, WE'LL ALL BE WATCHING WHAT HAPPENS IN TONIGHT'S\nDEBATE. WE'LL BRING IN OUR SUNDAY GROUP\nTO DISCUSS THE EXPLOSIVE REACTION OF TRUMP'S CRUDE\nREMARKS WITH REPUBLICANS CALLING ON HIM TO GET OUT OF THE RACE.\nWHAT IS THE IMPACT OF THE TRUMP  WE MAY USE YOUR CREDIT ON THE\nAIR.  -- YOUR QUESTION ON THE AIR.",

HOW DO YOU GET TO THE GOLDEN\nKEY? HOW DO WE FIGURE OUT WHAT WORKS\nAND THE PEOPLE THAT KNOW THE INDUSTRY BETTER THAN ANYBODY ARE\nTHE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THE INDUSTRY.\nTHAT WAS BACK DURING THE PRIMARIES WHEN SANDERS WAS\nDEMANDING CLINTON RELEASE TRANSCRIPTS OF HIS PAID\nSPEECHES.

IF THIS DONALD TRUMP WERE NOT\nOUT, WOULD WE NOT TALK ABOUT THESE SPEECH EXCERPTS AND\nHILLARY CLINTON SUCKING UP TO BANKERS?\n>> WELL, LOOK, SHE IS VERY FORTUNATE THAT RUSSIAN\nINTELLIGENCE AND JULIAN ASSANGE DON'T UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE\nBETWEEN A PRIMARY AND GENERAL ELECTION.\n>> THAT'S RIGHT. >> IF THIS HAD BEEN A MARCH\nSURPRISE, WE MIGHT HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT SET OF PEOPLE STANDING\nON THE DEBATE STAGE TONIGHT. THIS WAS REALLY, REALLY DAMAGING\nSTUFF. YOU CAN EXPLAIN SOME OF THIS\nAWAY. SHE'S KIND OF SAID THIS IN\nPUBLIC IN A SOFTER WAY AND OTHER THINGS SHE SAID.\nTHE MOST DAMAGING THING I THOUGHT SHE SAID JUST IN TERMS\nOF A SOUND BITE IF TRUMP WERE DOING COMMERCIALS WAS THIS\nNOTION THAT SHE COULD SAY THINGS IN PRIVATE AS A POLITICIAN AND\nTHEN THINGS PUBLICLY AND HAVE THEM BEEN DIFFERENT.\nTHAT CONFIRMS PEOPLE'S WORST FEARS ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON.\n>> RIGHT. THAT'S EXACTLY THE ISSUE THAT\nALL OF THESE WOMEN FOR EXAMPLE WHO ARE NOT HAPPY ABOUT EITHER\nCANDIDATE SAY THEY JUST SIMPLY FEEL THAT THEY CAN'T TRUST HER\nBECAUSE THEY THINK SHE SAYS WHATEVER SHE THINKS WOULD SUIT\nEACH AUDIENCE AND RIGHT IN THAT QUOTE, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE THAT\nEXACT THING. >> AND THOSE PROGRESSIVES, THE\nBERNIE OR BUSTER WHO ARE EITHER GOING TO SIT THIS OUT OR GO FOR\nJILL STINE OR GARY JOHNSON, THIS DOESN'T HELP HER WITH THOSE\nFOLKS AND THOSE MILLENNIAL VOTERS GOING BACK TO 2008 DIDN'T\nREALLY TRUST HER, DIDN'T TRUST HER IN THIS ELECTION AND HAVE\nBEEN TAILING OFF IN TERMS OF THEIR SUPPORT.\nSO IT DOESN'T HELP HER. BUT LISTEN, HOW CAN DONALD TRUMP\nMAKE THIS CASE? I ASSUME HE'LL TRY TO MAKE IT\nTONIGHT, BUT HE HAS SO MUCH OF HIS OWN VISCERAL TYPE OF BAGGAGE\nIT WILL BE INTERESTING HOW HE PLAYS IT.\n>> THE IDEA OF THE CAMPAIGN, GO THROUGH THESE TRANSCRIPTS JUST\nIN CASE THEY DO BECOME PUBLIC, TELL US OR IF WE'RE DEBATING\nWHETHER WE RELEASE THEM, SEE WHAT'S TROUBLESOME IN THERE.\nI BET DONALD TRUMP DOES BRING UP TONIGHT THAT IN A SPEECH TO A\nBRAZILIAN BANK IN 2013, SHE TALKED ABOUT THE UNITED STATES\nAND THE HEMISPHERE BEING LIKE THE EUROPEAN UNION, OPEN TRADE\nAND OPEN BORDERS. CONSERVATIVES HAVE JUMPED ON THE\nOPEN BORDERS PART. AND I ASSUME DONALD TRUMP WILL\nTRY TO MAKE HER ANSWER FOR THAT TONIGHT.\n>> JOHN, I DID A SEARCH ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON AFTER WE HEARD\nABOUT THIS ON CLINTON OPEN BORDERS AND ALMOST EVERYTHING\nTHAT POPPED UP WERE FACT CHECKS THAT SAID DONALD TRUMP HAS\nACCUSED HER OF WANTING OPEN BORDERS, SHE'S NEVER SAID THAT.\nNOW WE HAVE THE EVIDENCE THAT SHE HAS SAID THAT.\nI MEAN, I THINK THAT THIS ISSUE OF WHERE SHE STANDS ON TRADE IS\nAN IMPORTANT ONE. IT WILL BE AN IMPORTANT ONE\nGOING FORWARD. SHE HAS CLEARLY MOVED ON THIS\nISSUE. PEOPLE THINK THAT SHE MOVED ONLY\nFOR POLITICAL REASONS. SHE HASN'T EXPLAINED THIS.\nI THINK THIS FORCES HER AT SOME POINT AND PERHAPS TONIGHT TO BE\nMORE EXPLICIT ABOUT IF SHE'S CHANGED, WHY SHE'S CHANGED.\nWHAT SHE SAID THERE. DID SHE REALLY BELIEVE THAT AND\nWHY. >> WE HAVE JUST FORMULATE WHAT\nHAD WOULD BE PROBABLY THE MOST PLAUSIBLE DONALD TRUMP DEBATE\nSTRATEGY TONIGHT WHICH IS WHY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT A 2005\nTAPE, WHICH I HAVE ALREADY APOLOGIZED FOR, WHY AREN'T WE\nTALKING ABOUT THIS REVELATION OF WHAT HILLARY CLINTON REALLY\nSTANDS FOR AS PRESIDENT. IF I WERE THEM, I WOULD ANSWER\nALMOST EVERY QUESTION IN THE WAY THAT PENCE DID REFERRING TO\nTHESE HACKED E-MAILS. >> FORGET PENCE, WILLIAM\nJEFFERSON CLINTON USED QUITE SUCCESSFULLY IN 1992.\nHE WOULD SAY THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE THIS ELECTION ABOUT ME,\nTHIS ELECTION IS ABOUT YOU.

IS HILLARY CLINTON GOING TO\nBRING IT UP AT THE DEBATE SUNDAY NIGHT AND WHAT'S SHE'S GOING TO\nSAY, IF SO? >> WELL, I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW\nWHAT SHE'S GOING TO SAY ABOUT IT DURING THE DEBATE.\nI IMAGINE SOME OF THE UNDECIDED VOTERS WILL HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT\nIT AND I REALLY THINK IT'S FOR DONALD TRUMP TO TRY TO ANSWER IT\nAND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. HIS STATEMENT TRYING TO SAY,\nLOOK, I REGRET THESE WORDS, IT'S NOT JUST WORDS.\nIT REALLY IS TALKING ABOUT A PATTERN OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SO\nI JUST CAN'T IMAGINE THAT UNDECIDED VOTERS THAT ARE PART\nOF THIS TOWN HALL WILL NOT WANT TO HEAR HIM EXPLAIN WHY HE\nTHOUGHT THAT WAS ACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR.\n>> A PATTERN OF SEXUAL ASSAULT IS WHAT YOU SAID AND THAT\nCERTAINLY SOUNDS LIKE WHAT HE'S SAYING, BUT DO YOU KNOW OF ANY\nEVIDENCE THAT HE ACTUALLY ACTED IN THAT WAY?\n>> MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE ARE STORIES IN SOME PAPERS\nTODAY WITH INDIVIDUALS BASICALLY SAYING THAT THEY WERE SUBJECT TO\nEXACTLY THE TREATMENT THAT HE DESCRIBES ON THE TAPE.\nSO, YOU KNOW, THIS WOULD BE A QUESTION FOR DONALD TRUMP TO\nANSWER IF HE SAYS I MAY HAVE SAID THOSE THINGS BUT I NEVER\nDID THEM, THAT'S ONE THING. BUT I THINK THE TAPE RAISES AN\nAWFUL LOT OF QUESTIONS. AND IF YOU TAKE THAT TAPE AS\nDONALD HAS ACCURATELY DESCRIBING HIS ACTIONS, THEN, YEAH, IT IS A\nPATTERN OF ASSAULTIVE BEHAVIOR AND MUCH MORE THAN WORDS.\nI THINK THE ISSUE, JAKE, THAT IT RAISES IS NOT JUST A QUESTION\nFOR DONALD TRUMP TO ADDRESS AS HE TALKS TO THE VOTERS DURING\nTHE DEBATE, BUT IT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT CANDIDATES WHO\nSTOOD WITH DONALD TRUMP HAVE TO ADDRESS.\nIF YOU ARE A GOP OFFICE HOLDER OR CANDIDATE AND YOU STOOD WITH\nDONALD TRUMP, PEOPLE OUGHT TO BE ASKING YOU NOW, DO YOU STILL\nTHINK HE'S QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT AND DO YOU STILL\nSUPPORT HIM? A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE\nWITHDRAWING THEIR SUPPORT, BUT ANYBODY WHO HASN'T DECLARED\nWHERE THEY ARE ON THAT QUESTION NEEDS TO BE ASKED THAT QUESTION.\n>> AS YOU NOTED, A NUMBER OF REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS ARE\nWITHDRAWING THEIR SUPPORT, A NUMBER OF THEM ARE ALSO CALLING\nON DONALD TRUMP TO STEP ASIDE AND LET GOVERNOR MIKE PENCE BE\nIN THE TOP OF THE TICKET. WITHOUT GETTING INTO STATE BY\nSTATE CAMPAIGN AND ELECTION LAW AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S EVEN\nPOSSIBLE, DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE THE RIGHT MOVE FOR THE\nCOUNTRY? >> WELL, I DON'T PRESUME TO GIVE\nTHE GOP ADVICE. THE GOP HAD A NOMINATING PROCESS\nAND THEY CHOSE DONALD TRUMP AS THEIR CANDIDATE.\nYOU'RE RIGHT, JAKE, THAT IT IS A COMPLICATED THING.\nTHE VOTES OF ALL 50 STATES. I MEAN, MY SON, FOR EXAMPLE, IS\nIN THE MILITARY. HE IS DEPLOYED OVERSEAS.\nHE CAST HIS VOTE A WEEK AGO. THERE HAVE BEEN HUNDREDS OF\nTHOUSANDS OF VOTES CAST IN MULTIPLE STATES AND BY TROOPS\nAND AMERICANS LIVING ABROAD. SO IT'S COMPLICATED, BUT THE\nQUESTION OF WHO THE GOP NOMINEE IS WAS RESOLVED BY THE GOP IN\nCLEVELAND AND IF THEY REGRET IT NOW, IT'S UP TO THEM TO\nDETERMINE WHAT THEY WOULD WANT TO DO ABOUT IT.\n>> I'M SURE YOU KNOW DONALD TRUMP PUT OUT A VIDEO MESSAGE ON\nFRIDAY. HE SAID, QUOTE, I WAS WRONG AND\nI APOLOGIZE. BUT THEN HE CALLED THIS A\nDISTRACTION AND CRITICIZED BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON.\nTAKE A LISTEN. --\n>> I'VE SAID SOME FOOLISH THINGS, BUT THERE'S A BIG\nDIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE WORDS AND ACTIONS OF OTHER PEOPLE.\nBILL CLINTON HAS ACTUALLY ABUSED WOMEN AND HILLARY HAS BULLIED,\nATTACKED, SHAMED AND INTIMIDATED HIS VICTIMS.\n>> I'M SURE THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS PREPARING FOR THAT CHARGE TO\nBE LEVELLED SUNDAY EVENING. WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSE?\n>> WELL, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS SOME CHANCE THIS WAS GOING TO\nCOME UP AT MY DEBATE EARLIER THIS WEEK BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP\nAFTER HE LOST THE FIRST DEBATE WENT TO THE SPIN ROOM AND SAID,\nOKAY NOW THE CLINTONS MARRIAGE IS FAIR GAME.\nAND I CAN'T SAY HOW DONALD TRUMP SHOULD RUN HIS CAMPAIGN, BUT I\nCAN SAY THIS, THE CLINTON/KAINE CAMPAIGN IS NOT ABOUT THIS.\nIT'S NOT ABOUT THE MARRIAGES OF FOLKS AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET.\nIT'S ABOUT ISSUES THAT VOTERS CARE ABOUT.\nAND I KNOW THAT THOSE VOTERS AT THE TOWN HALL FORRUM TOMORROW\nNIGHT WILL HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS.\nMY GUT IS THAT MOST OF THE QUESTIONS ARE GOING TO BE ABOUT\nREALLY BASIC ISSUES LIKE HOW TO GROW THE ECONOMY AND HOW TO KEEP\nAMERICA SAFE IN THE WORLD. IF DONALD WANTS TO TALK ABOUT\nSOMETHING OTHER THAN THAN WHAT VOTERS WANT TO TALK ABOUT,\nTHAT'S HIS CHOICE. BUT I SUSPECT THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE THINGS THAT VOTERS REALLY\nCARE ABOUT. >> WELL, YOU ALSO SAID JUST A\nFEW MINUTES AGO THAT YOU THINK THE VOTERS WILL HAVE QUESTIONS\nABOUT WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAYS ON THIS TAPE, SO IT'S NOT AS THOUGH\nTHE PERSONAL CONDUCT OF DONALD TRUMP YOU THINK IS SOMETHING\nTHAT VOTERS ARE NOT INTERESTED IN.\nIS IT NOT POSSIBLE THAT SOME OF THEM MIGHT ALSO HAVE QUESTIONS\nABOUT BILL CLINTON'S BEHAVIOR AND HILLARY CLINTON'S RESPONSE\nTO BILL CLINTON'S BEHAVIOR? >> I WOULD FIND IT UNLIKELY BUT\nAGAIN IT'S GOING TO BE THOSE VOTERS THAT ASK ABOUT IT.\nREMEMBER, JAKE, THIS IS ACTUALLY PART OF A BROADER PATTERN\nBECAUSE AS I WAS GETTING INTO IN MY DEBATE TUESDAY, DONALD TRUMP\nHAS RUN A CAMPAIGN WHERE HE'S PERPETRATED A BIGOTED LIE THAT\nPRESIDENT OBAMA WASN'T A UNITED STATES CITIZEN.\nHE'S GONE AFTER IMMIGRANTS. HE'S GONE AFTER MUSLIMS.\nHE'S ATTACKED MILITARY FAMILIES AND JOHN McCAIN A P.O.W.\nHE SAID MANY OTHER DEPLORABLE THINGS ABOUT WOMEN.\nTHERE'S A BROAD PATTERN OF DISRESPECT BOTH IN WORD, ACTION\nAND POLICY TOWARD ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE.\nAND THAT IS I THINK WHY THIS ISSUE ON FRIDAY JUST SO\nGALVANIZED PEOPLE BECAUSE IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN EXPLAIN\nAWAY AS AN ABERRATION OR HEAR IS SOMETHING THAT THIS IS ME 10\nYEARS AGO, IT'S NOT ME NOW. THERE'S PLENTY OF EVIDENCE THAT\nTHIS IS EXACTLY WHO DONALD TRUMP IS TODAY AND BY THIS I MEAN\nDIVISIVE AND CAVALIER IN HIS TREATMENT OF OTHERS.\nAND WITH RESPECT TO WOMEN IN PARTICULAR, WHAT THIS SHOWS I\nTHINK AT ITS BASE IS THAT HE CANNOT CONSIDER WOMEN AS HIS\nEQUALS. I THINK THERE'S KIND OF A PIECE\nOF THE JIGSAW PUZZLE MISSING IN DONALD TRUMP WHERE HE DOES NOT\nLOOK AT WOMEN AND CONSIDER THEM AS EQUAL TO HIMSELF.\n>> STORY FROM 2002 WHEN THE REPUBLICAN SPEAKER OF VIRGINIA\nHOUSE OF DELEGATES WAS FACING ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT\nAND IT SAYS THAT YOU WERE QUOTED SAYING, IF THE ALLEGATIONS ARE\nTRUE, HE SHOULD DEFINITELY RESIGN.\nTHEN IT SAYS YOU HELD THE SAME VIEW ABOUT PRESIDENT CLINTON\nDURING THE LEWINSKY SCANDAL. IS THAT DESCRIBING YOUR VIEW\nACCURATELY AND IS THAT AT ALL RELEVANT, IF SO?\n>> NOT MY FEELINGS BACK IN THE '90s.\nWE'RE IN 2016 NOW. THERE ARE TWO NAMES ON THE\nBALLOT FOR PRESIDENT. HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP\nAND THAT'S THE CHOICE THAT VOTERS HAVE TO MAKE.\n>> LET'S TURN TO THE LATEST REVELATIONS FROM WI KEY LINKS.\nWE GOT A GLIMPSE FROM THOSE FAMOUS PAID SPEECHES BY HILLARY\nCLINTON THAT BERNIE SANDERS WANTED RELEASED DURING THE\nDEMOCRATIC PRIMARIES ONE OF THEM IN A CLOSED DOOR 2013 SPEECH TO\nA BRAZILIAN SPEECH SECRETARY CLINTON SAID THIS I QUOTE, MY\nDREAM IS A HEMISPHERIC COMMON MARKET WITH OPEN BORDERS,\nSOMETIME IN THE FUTURE. IS THAT HER DREAM?\nIS THAT WHAT SHE WANTS? OPEN BORDERS, AN OPEN MARKET?\n>> YEAH, JAKE. I'M GLAD YOU ASKED IT THAT WAY.\nI DON'T THINK WE CAN DIGNIFY DOCUMENTS DUMPED BY WIKILEAKS\nAND JUST ASSUME THAT THEY'RE ALL ACCURATE AND TRUE.\nANYBODY WHO HACKS INTO GET DOCUMENTS IS COMPLETELY CAPABLE\nOF MANIPULATING THEM. BUT YOU ASKED THE QUESTION ABOUT\nWHAT IS HER POSITION ON POLICY. HILLARY'S POSITION ON POLICY ON\nMARKETS AND TRADE IS VERY PLAIN, WHICH IS WE'LL DO TRADE DEALS\nBUT ONLY IF THEY MEET THREE CRY ST\nTEAR YA. INCREASE AMERICAN JOBS AND WANGS\nAND ARE THEY GOOD FOR NATIONAL SECURITY.\nIF THEY ARE AND IF WE CAN ENFORCE THEM, THEN TRADE DEALS\nARE OKAY. IF NOT, WE CAN'T EMBRACE THEM.\nWHEN HILLARY WAS A U.S. SENATOR, SHE VOTED FOR SOME TRADE DEALS\nWHEN THEY MET HER STANDARDS, BUT SHE VOTED AGAINST OTHERS WHEN\nTHEY DIDN'T. WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT SO THAT THE\nONLY TRADE DEALS WE'LL CONTEMPLATE ARE ONES THAT HAVE\nTHE HIGH STANDARDS THAT SHE SET OUT.\n>> RIGHT. BUT SENATOR, FIRST OF ALL, ARE\nYOU DISPUTING THE SACCURACY SOF THIS?\nDID HILLARY CLINTON NOT SAY TO THESE BRAZILIAN BANKERS THAT SHE\nHAS THIS DREAM? >> JAKE, I HAVE NO WAY OF\nKNOWING THE ACCURACY OF DOCUMENTS DUMPED BY THIS HACKING\nORGANIZATION. BUT I THINK IT IS REALLY\nIMPORTANT THIS HACKING HAS BEEN CONNECTED MUCH OF THE HACKING\nHAS BEEN CONNECTED TO THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT.\nYESTERDAY THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE INDICATED\nTHAT THIS KIND OF HACKING HAS BEEN TRACED DIRECTLY TO THE\nRUSSIAN GOVERNMENT AND THERE IS A DIRECT INTENT TO INFLUENCE THE\nOUTCOME OF AN AMERICAN ELECTION. IF THAT IS, IN FACT, TRUE, YOU\nCANNOT ACCEPT AS GOSPEL TRUTH EVERYTHING THAT THEY MIGHT PUT\nIN A DOCUMENT. BUT YOU DIDN'T ASK ABOUT THE\nDOCUMENT, YOU ASKED ME WHAT HILLARY CLINTON'S POSITION WAS.\n>> RIGHT, THAT'S FAIR. IS THIS DOCUMENT THEN IS IT\nACCURATE? DID SHE TELL BRAZILIAN BANKERS\nTHAT HER DREAM -- >> I HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING\nTHAT. I HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING THAT.\n>> WELL, YOU COULD ASK HER. >> BUT THE DOCUMENTS ARE IN THE\nTHOUSANDS. I HAVEN'T ASKED HER.\nYOU ASKED ME ABOUT HER POSITION ON TRADE.\nHER POSITION ON TRADE IS VERY CLEAR.\n>> WHAT ABOUT HER POSITION ON BORDERS.\nSHE SAYS HER DREAM IN THIS DOCUMENT, HER DREAM IS A\nHEMISPHERIC COMMON MARKET WITH OPEN BORDERS.\nIS THAT SOMETHING THAT -- IN THE CLINTON/KANE ADMINISTRATION WE\nWOULD SEE OPEN BORDERS? >> WE BELIEVE IN COMPREHENSIVE\nIMMIGRATION REFORM THAT WOULD WITH THE PILLARS THAT WE'VE\nDESCRIBED WHERE WE WOULD HAVE MORE BORDER SECURITY.\nJAKE, AS YOU KNOW, I VOTED FOR SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN JUNE\nOF 2013 AND CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT'S PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE\nIMMIGRATION REFORM PLAN ALONG WITH THE VALUE OF KEEPING\nFAMILIES TOGETHER IN PROVIDING A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP FOR THOSE\nWHO WORK HARD, PLAY BY THE RULES AND PAY TAXES.\n>> ALL RIGHT, SENATOR TIM KAINE, THANK YOU SO MUCH.\nWE ALWAYS APPRECIATE YOU COMING AND ANSWERING OUR QUESTIONS.\nI APPRECIATE IT AND GOOD LUCK ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAILS.\n>> VERY GLAD TO, JAKE. >> TRUMP AND HIS ADVISE HERBS\nSPENT THE WEEKEND HUDDLED INSIDE TRUMP TOWER.\nWHAT IS THEIR STRATEGY GOING INTO TONIGHT'S DEBATE?\nRUDY GIULIANI WILL BE HERE NEXT.

WE ARE CONTINUING TO FOLLOW WHO\nHAS BEEN A SNOWBALL EFFECT OF FALLOUT FOR REPUBLICAN\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP, 31 DAYS BEFORE THE\nELECTION, DUE TO THIS 2005 VIDEOTAPE THAT WAS RELEASED\nYESTERDAY BY THE WASHINGTON POST.\nWE WILL READ YOU A STATEMENT WE JUST GOT FROM BER TAINMENT HOST\nNANCY O'DELL WHO WAS THE SUBJECT OF DONALD TRUMP'S RUDE REMARKS\nIN THAT TAPE. SHE WROTE, POLITICS ASIDE, I'LL\nI'M SADDENED THAT ALL THESE COMMENTS STILL EXIST IN OUR\nSOCIETY AT ALL. WHEN I WE HEARD THE COMMENTS\nYESTERDAY, IT WAS DISAPPOINTING TO HEAR SUCH AN OBJECTIFICATION\nOF WOMEN T. CONVERSATION NEEDS TO CHANGE BECAUSE NO FEMALE, NO\nPERSON, SHOULD BE THE SUBJECT OF SUCH CRASS COMMENTS WHETHER OR\nNOT CAMERAS ARE ROLLING. EVERYONE DESERVES RESPECT NO MA\nITSELF THE SETTING OR GENDER. AS A WOMAN WHO HAS WORKED VERY\nHARD TO ESTABLISH HER CAREER, AND AS A MOM, I FEEL I MUST\nSPEAK OUT WITH THE HOPE THAT THE SOCIETY WILL ALWAYS STRIVE TO BE\nBETTER. FOR MORE ON THE FALLOUT, LET ME\nBRING IN CNN'S JAMIE GANG EL. SHE IS IN WASHINGTON, SHE HAS\nBEEN SPEAKING WITH HER SOURCES. AMY, PAUL RYAN JUST TOOK IF\nSTAGE. HE SAID THERE IS AN ELEPHANT IN\nTHE ROOM BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT WE ARE HERE TO TALK ABOUT.\nYOUR REACTION. >> Reporter: SO, LOOK, THE GOP\nSOURCES I TALKED TO, THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE ELECTED\nOFFICIALS. THEY ARE LONG TIME VETERANS.\nSOME OF THEM HAVE TIES TO THE TRUMP CAMP, AND THEY ARE STILL\nHOPING THAT THERE IS, THAT TRUMP MIGHT STEP ASIDE.\nBUT I WANT TO SAY, USE THE WORD WISHING, BECAUSE THIS IS WISHFUL\nTHINKING. THERE IS JUST NO EVIDENCE AS\nWE'VE SEEN FROM TRUMP. HE JUST DOUBLED DOWN AGAIN IN\nHIS RECENT STATEMENT TO SAY THAT HE'S NOT GETTING OUT, NO MATTER\nWHAT. BUT THESE PARTY VETERANS ARE\nJUST LOOKING AT WAYS TO SEE IF THERE IS ANYTHING THAT THEY CAN\nDO THAT MIGHT CHANGE HIS MIND. BUT AS ONE PERSON SAID TO ME,\nDONALD TRUMP IS ONLY LISTENING TO ONE PERSON AND THAT'S DONALD\nTRUMP. POPPY.\n>> YOU KNOW, JAMIE, YOU'VE, OBVIOUSLY, DONE A LOT OF\nREPORTING, ESPECIALLY ON THE BUSH FAMILY AND YOU'VE\nINTERVIEWED JEB AND YOU'VE INTERVIEWED BOTH FORMER BUSH\nPRESIDENTS. THE OTHER PERSON IN THE\nVIDEOTAPE IS BILLY BUSH, THE COUSIN OF JEB BUSH.\nWE HAD JEB BUSH COME OUT WITH A STATEMENT YESTERDAY CONDEMNING\nTHIS. ANY OTHER REACTION YOU CAN SHARE\nWITH US FROM THE BUSH CAMP, THE BUSH FAMILY IN.\n>> Reporter: SO, I'VE REACHED OUT TO EVERYONE IN THE BUSH\nFAMILY. THEY ARE NOT COMMENTING.\nI THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT JEB'S TWEET YESTERDAY SPEAKS FOR\nTHE FAMILY. MAYBE WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM\nHIS SON, GEORGE P. BUSH, WHO'S THE TAX COMMISSIONER THE NEXT\nDAY. HE HAS BEEN ACTUALLY SUPPORTING\nDONALD TRUMP. BUT I THINK THIS IS A VERY\nAWKWARD SITUATION FOR THE FAMILY.\nBILLY BUSH, SOME PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THIS, HE IS THE NEPHEW\nOF FORMER PRESIDENT BUSH THE FIRST COUSIN OF JEB BUSH AND\nPRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH. SO I REALLY THINK THAT, YOU\nKNOW, THIS IS FAMILY FOR THEM. THEY DON'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED\nIN IT. BUT I THINK JEB'S WORDS PROBABLY\nSPEAK FOR HOW EVERYONE IS FEELING, POPPY.\n>> JAMIE, I APPRECIATE THE REPORTING, OBVIOUSLY.\nWE'LL COME BACK TO YOU AS YOU GET MORE OF IT.\nIF YOU HAVE MANY MORE -- [ INAUDIBLE ]\nJAMIE GANGEL, THANK YOU FOR THE REPORTING.\nMORE PEOPLE CALLING FOR THE GOVERNOR OF INDIANA, MIKE PENCE,\nTO TAKE THE TICKET. 31 ELECTIONS, IS THAT EVEN\nPOSSIBLE? IF SO, WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO\nHAPPEN? WE WILL TALK ABOUT HOW THAT\nCOULD POSSIBLY BE THE CASE FOR A COMPLEX RULE?\nWE'LL DIVE INTO IT NEXT. YOU ARE LIVE IN THE CNN\n\"NEWSROOM.\"",

HIS COMMENTS WERE CRUDE.\nTHEY WERE OFFENSIVE AND THEY ARE INDEFENSIBLE BUT THEY'RE STILL\nNOT ENOUGH TO MAKE ME VOTE FOR HILLARY CLIN ON THE AND WE NEED\nTO PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE. LAST WEEK I WAS AT TRUMP TOWER\nAND I MODERATED A MEETING BETWEEN MR. TRUMP AND RELIGIOUS\nLEADERS AND I WOULD SAY LOOK, I WILL NOT CHOOSE HIM AS A SUNDAY\nSCHOOLTEACHER IN HI CHURCH BUT WE'RE LOOKING FOR A LEADER THAT\nCAN REVERSE THE DOWNWARD DEBT SPIRAL THIS NATION IS IN AND\nDONALD TRUMP IS THE BEST PERSON TO DO THAT IN SPITE OF THE\nCOMMENTS. YES AWFUL COMMENTS HE MADE 11\nYEARS AGO AND BY THE WAY FOR WHICH HE HAS APOLOGIZED.\n>> LET ME ASK YOU THIS, PASTOR. I SUSPECT AND WHEN THEY TALK\nABOUT THIS A LOT IN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, THIS IS OCTOBER\nSURPRISE. BUT I SUSPECT THAT THERE MAY BE\nOTHER COMMENTS THAT ARE GOING TO BE LEAKED AS WIKILEAKS AND THIS\nIS JUST MY CONCLUSION AND THEY CONTINUE TO POUR OUT, WE HAVE\nEVEN MORE WIKILEAKS WHICH I'LL TALK ABOUT LATER IN THE SHOW.\nWHAT DO YOU SAY TO OTHER EVANGELICALS.\nYOU MIGHT FEEL THAT DONALD IS THE BEST PERSON TO RUN THE\nCOUNTRY. >> I DON'T TALK LIKE THAT.\nBUT WE ALL ARE SINNERS. EVERYBODY IS A SINNER THE BIBLE\nSAYS. WE ALL NEED GOD'S FORGIVENESS\nAND GOD IS ABLE TO FORGIVE ANYONE THAT ASKS BUT I AM HAVING\nA HOT OF CONVERSATIONS WE VAN GEL CAL LEADERS AND THEY SAID\nWHAT ABOUT CHARACTER. DOESN'T CHARACTER COUNT?\nAND I SAY OF COURSE IT DOES. HILLARY CLINTON HAS A SUPERIOR\nCHARACTER TO DONALD TRUMP? HERE IS A WOMAN THAT'S DELETED\n33,000 E-MAILS. SHE HAS ATTACKED THE WOMEN THAT\nARE SEX CRUELLY BY HER HUSBAND AND SHE SUPPORTS THE\nDISMEMBERING OF BABIES IN THE WOMB THROUGH PARTIAL-BIRTH\nABORTION. TO ME THAT'S THE HEIGHT OF\nIMMORALITY. >> WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT DONALD\nTRUMP NEEDS TO DO TOMORROW NIGHT AT THIS DEBATE AND, YOU KNOW,\nHOW CAN HE OVERCOME THIS ISSUE WITH THOSE WHO ARE SO OFFENDED\nTHAT THEY DON'T EVEN WANT TO VOTE?\n>> LOOK I THINK HE NEEDS TO MOST OF ALL AND FIRST OF ALL SHOW\nGENUINE CONTRITION AND SAY WHAT HE DID LAST NIGHT.\nTHIS IS NOT THE MAN I AM AND BY THE WAY, I CAN TESTIFY TO THAT.\nI HAVE BEEN AROUND HIM THE LAST YEAR IN A NUMBER OF SITUATIONS\nWITH HIS FAMILY. I WATCHED HIM INTERACT WITH THE\nCHILDREN. MY WIFE AND I HAVE BEEN WITH HIM\nON SEVERAL OCCASIONS. HE IS NOTHING EXCEPT RESPECTFUL\nTOWARD WOMEN AND TOWARD OTHERS. THE DONALD TRUMP I KNOW TODAY IS\nNOT THE DONALD TRUMP THAT WAS IN THOSE TAPES 11 YEARS AGO AND I\nTHINK HE NEEDS TO KEEP SAYING WHAT HE DID LAST NIGHT.\nI'M A CHANGED PERSON AND AS YOUR PRESIDENT I WILL NEVER DO\nANYTHING TO EMBARRASS YOU. >> AND PASTOR, HILLARY CLINTON,\nIF SHE CONTINUES TO, YOU KNOW, PAINT DONALD TRUMP AS THIS KIND\nOF PERSON AND I BELIEVE THAT THE DEBATE LAST WEEK IN THE\nREFERENCE TO MACHADO WAS THE TEE UP TO THIS SO IT WOULD LOOK LIKE\nA CUMULATIVE THING. SHE CONTINUES TO DO THIS THING\nAND COULD SHE TURN EVANGELICALS AROUND?\n>> SHE WILL NEVER TURN THE MAJORITY OF EVANGELICALS TOWARD\nHER. DONALD TRUMP IS THE ONLY\nPRO-LIFE, PRO-RELIGIOUS CELEBRITY.\nPRO-CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES OF THE SUPREME COURT CANDIDATE THAT WE\nHAVE. THAT'S WHAT THIS ELECTION IS\nABOUT FOR CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIANS.\nIT'S ABOUT THE SUPREME COURT. THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL SELECT\nOR NOMINATE TWO OR THREE JUSTICES THAT WILL SHAPE THIS\nNATION FOR A GENERATION AND WE NEED JUSTICES THAT WILL\nINTERPRET THE LAW USING THE CONSTITUTION AND NOT POLITICAL\nCORRECTNESS. AND DON'T LOSE FOCUS ABOUT WHAT\nTHIS ELECTION IS ABOUT. IT'S ABOUT THE SUPREME COURT AND\nTHE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY. >> ALL RIGHT.\nALL RIGHT. THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.\nAND I LOOK FORWARD TO TALKING TO YOU AGAIN.\n>> DR. JEFFREYS MAY NOT AGREE BUT SOME PEOPLE ARE CALLING ON\nDONALD TRUMP TO STEP ASIDE BUT HOW WOULD THAT EVEN WORK AT THIS\nSTAGE IN THE GAME? DAVID IS STANDING BY LIVE TO\nTALK ABOUT THAT AS WELL AS TRUMP'S CHANCES OF SURVIVING THE\nLATEST STORM AND LATER -- >> WE WOULDN'T BE FOCUSSING ON\nIT AS MUCH -- >> DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT?\nOH, COME ON. GET PAST IT.\n>> AND I DEBATE THE DEBATERS. I'LL ASK THE DEBATE SOCIETY IF\nTHEY CAN OFFER ANY TIPS TO DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY\nCLINTON. TONIGHT.",

WHAT HE SAID WOULD BE ADMISSIBLE\nEVIDENCE IN A VARIETY OF LEGAL CONTEXTS.\nAS HIS STATE OF MIND, AS EVIDENCE OF HIS PAST BEHAVIOR,\nAND AS HIS CHARACTER. WHAT MAKES THIS STAND OUT FROM\nALL OF HIS PRIOR PROFANITY, HE ACTUALLY ADMITS PREDATORY SEXUAL\nCONDUCT, IF IT HAD COME OUT OF THE MOUTH OF, SAY, BILL COSBY,\nWOULD BE USED IN THE CRIMINAL TRIAL AGAINST HIM.\nWHETHER THE GOP CAN STILL DUMP TRUMP A MONTH FROM ELECTION SAY\nD DAY WHEN HIS NAME CANNOT BE\nREMOVED FROM THE BALLOTS. HAS REINCE PRIEBUS LOST CONTROL\nOF THE GOP? HE'S NOT TAKEN ANY OTHER ACTION\nBESIDES CRITICIZING DONALD TRUMP.\nGOP PENNSYLVANIA CONGRESSMAN CHARLIE DENTS SAID IF HE CAN'T\nGET TRUMP OUT OF THE RACE, PRIEBUS HIMSELF MUST RESIGN.\nON THE PHONE IS PENNSYLVANIA CONGRESSMAN CHARLIE DENT.\nARE YOU HERE? >> I'M HERE, IF YOU CAN HEAR ME.\n>> SO TALK ME ABOUT WHAT MOTIVATED YOU TO RELEASE YOUR\nSTATEMENT TODAY AND WHAT IS IT YOU'RE ASKING TO TAKE PLACE?\n>> WELL, FIRST, LOOK, I SIMPLY CANNOT DEFEND THE INDEFENSIBLE.\nAND I MUST UNEQUIVOCALLY CONDEMN THE STATEMENTS.\nIT'S SAD WE'RE AT THIS POINT BUT THAT'S WHERE WE ARE.\nI'VE LONG HAD RESERVATIONS AND PROBLEMS WITH NOMINEES BECAUSE\nOF HIS, MATTER OF THE TONE, POLICY, TEMPERAMENT, AT TIMES,\nFITNESS, BUT THIS IS JUST A REMINDER THAT HE SHOULDN'T BE\nOUR NOMINEE. DO I THINK DONALD TRUMP SHOULD\nBE STEPPED ASIDE? YES.\nWILL HE? NO.\nFOR THAT REASON, I THINK IT'S ON THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL\nCONVENTION TO TAKE ACTION TO SALVAGE WHAT'S LEFT OF THIS\nELECTION CYCLE. WILLING TO DO THAT, UNABLE TO DO\nTHAT, WE NEED SOMEONE IN CHARGE WHO WILL.\nTHAT'S ALL I'M SAYING. AND SOMEBODY HAS TO TAKE\nRESPONSIBILITY AND SOME LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY AS WELL FOR US TO\nWHERE WE ARE. THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE AND\nMAJORITY LEADER OF THE SENATE HAVE THEIR PRIORITIES WHICH IS\nTO PROTECT THE MAJORITIES, THAT'S WHERE THEY MUST BE\nFOCUSED. SOMEBODY MUST DEAL WITH THE\nISSUE OF THE TOP OF THE TICKET AND FAST.\n>> YOU'VE TAKEN IT A STEP FURTHER THAN OTHERS.\nMANY ARE CONDEMNING WHAT TRUMP HAS SAID FROM WITHIN YOUR PARTY\nAND I JUST LISTED A NAME, A WHOLE LIST OF THEM AND SHOULD\nMAKE REFERENCE TO PAT TOOMEY, WHO TOO CONDEMNED TRUMP.\nYOU'RE A STEP FURTHER AND SAY, CHAIRMAN PRIEBUS, IF YOU CAN'T\nDICTATE THE OUTCOME OF THIS, YOU YOURSELF NEED TO STEP ASIDE.\n>> WELL, LIKE I SAID, SOMEBODY NEEDS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND\nACCEPT SOME LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY.\nI HAVE NOT BEEN AGAINST THE CHAIRMAN.\nI RESPECT HIM, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, SOMEONE MUST BE LOOKING\nOUT FOR THE BEST INTEREST, NOT ONLY OF THE COUNTRY BUT OF THE\nPARTY AT THIS POINT TOO. THE PARTY.\nSOMEBODY HAS TO TAKE THAT VIEW AND SEE WHAT'S IN THE BEST\nINTEREST AS A WHOLE. A NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES THINK\nTHE NOMINEE SHOULD WITHDRAW AND I'M IN THAT CATEGORY TOO, BUT I\nDON'T THINK HE WILL. SO SOMEBODY HAS TO TAKE SOME\nACTION HERE TO TRY TO SALVAGE WHAT'S LEFT OF THE CYCLE.\nYOU KNOW, SOMEONE OTHER THAN THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE\nCAN DO THIS? TELL ME WHO IT IS AND ID LIKE TO\nSPEAK WITH THEM. THAT'S WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW.\nVERY CONCERNED. THERE HAS TO BE SOME LEVEL OF\nACCOUNTABILITY BECAUSE THIS IS AN UNACCEPTABLE SITUATION.\n>> FINAL QUESTION. DO THE RULES ALLOW CHAIRMAN\nPRIEBUS TO DO SOMETHING? BECAUSE I KEEP HEARING THAT\nDONALD TRUMP WOULD HAVE TO VOLUNTARILY RESIGN IN ORDER TO\nBE REPLACED. IS YOUR UNDERSTANDING ANY\nDIFFERENT THAN WHAT I'VE JUST ARTICULATED?\n>> I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE RULES. RAN\nI DIDN'T EXPECT TO BE HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS TODAY\nBECAUSE A LOT OF US ARE TRYING TO ENJOY SOME FOOTBALL TODAY.\nAND WE'VE ALL BEEN INTERRUPTED BECAUSE OF THESE ACTIONS OF,\nTHESE STATEMENTS. I'M NOT CLEAR YET WHAT THE RULES\nWILL ALLOW BUT SOMEBODY NEEDS TO GET WORK ON THIS QUICKLY.\nA REPLACEMENT, MAYBE TALKING ABOUT MIKE PENCE, OF COURSE, HE\nWOULD BE ACCEPTABLE. I'M A JOHN KASICH GUY\nPERSONALLY, I THINK HE WOULD BE TERRIFIC AND THIS IS A WINNABLE\nRACE AND PENCE SAID WE NEED TO SUPPORT THE NOMINEE BECAUSE OF\nTHE SUPREME COURT. I SAID, HE'S MADE HIMSELF\nUNELECTABLE, HOW DOES THAT HELP THE SUPREME COURT?\nTHE TOP OF THE TICKET TO SALVAGE THIS ELECTION AND POSSIBLY WIN\nTHIS THING, SO WE CAN TRY TO PROTECT THE SUPREME COURT.\n>> HAVE YOU HEARD BACK FROM CHAIRMAN PRIEBUS IN RESPONSE TO\nYOUR CALL THAT HE HIMSELF NEEDS TO STEP ASIDE IF HE CAN'T REIN\nTHIS IN? >> NO, I HAVEN'T.\nI JUST WANT SOMEBODY TO TAKE LEADERSHIP AND ACCEPT\nRESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT'S GOING ON.\nTHEY'RE POINTING FINGERS SAYING I HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THIS AND\nEVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF DEALING WITH THIS\nSITUATION. THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT\nTHERE UP FOR ELECTION THIS YEAR AND VERY VULNERABLE SITUATIONS\nBUT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT ELECTIONS BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT\nFOR OUR COUNTRY AND AS ALWAYS, OUR PARTY BUT WE MUST DO WHAT'S\nRIGHT HERE AND SOMEBODY NEEDS TO STEP UP AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE\nTHE CHAIRMAN DO THAT. I HAVE RESPECT FOR HIM.\nI THINK HE COULD. BUT INACTION AT THIS MOMENT IS\nNOT AN OPTION. >> CONGRESSMAN CHARLIE DENT,\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALLOWING US TO INTRUDE ON YOUR SATURDAY\nEVENING. >> THANK YOU.\nJOINING ME, THREE CNN COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE A TOUGH JOB ON THEIR\nHANDS. ALL DEFENDERS, AT LEAST UP UNTIL\nNOW, OF DONALD TRUMP. JEFFREY, KALEY, AND JEFF, FIRST\nOF ALL, A PRELIMINARY QUESTION, ARE ANY OF YOU GETTING OFF THE\nTRUMP TRAIN RIGHT NOW? SPEAK NOW OR FOREVER HOLD YOUR\nPEACE. >> NEVER.\n>> SOUNDS LIKE NOBODY. JEF\nJEFFREY, WHAT WOULD IT HAVE TO TAKE FOR YOU TO GET OFF?\nI MEAN, I THINK YOU'RE THE EMBODIMENT ABOUT WHAT HE SAID\nABOUT GETTING OUT ON FIFTH AVENUE AND SHOOT SOMEBODY.\nIS THERE ANYTHING DONALD TRUMP COULD DO TO CAUSE YOU TO SAY,\nI'M OUT OF HEERE? >> NO.\nWE'RE 30 DAYS OUT FROM THIS ELECTION, MIKEL.\nWHAT HE SAID WAS TERRIBLE. NO QUESTION.\nBUT BILL CLINTON'S NAME HAS BEEN RAISED HERE AND THERE'S A POINT\nNOT BEING MADE. WHEN BILL CLINTON GOT INTO ALL\nOF HIS PROBLEMS AND THE WORLD POUNCED ON HIM, NOT ONLY WERE\nEVERY DEMOCRAT OUT THERE DEFENDING HIM AND LET'S\nREMEMBER, THERE WERE ACCUSATIONS OF RAPE, GROPING IN THE OVAL\nOFFICE, ET CETERA. HIS POPULARITY WENT UP.\nAND REPUBLICANS WHO WENT AFTER HIM GOT CLOBBERED.\nNOW, I WOULD RESPECTFULLY SUGGEST THAT PEOPLE NEED TO BE\nVERY CAREFUL HERE. YOU SAW THAT RECEPTION WITH\nDONALD TRUMP COMING OUT OF TRUMP TOWER TODAY.\nI THINK WE COULD GET A LOT OF BLOWBACK HERE BECAUSE IT'S\nBECOMING INCREASINGLY AN ISSUE OF THE ELITES AND THE POLITICAL\nCLASS VERSUS AVERAGE WORKING AMERICANS.\nAND THOSE FOLKS ARE NOT HAPPY IN THE FIRST PLACE.\n70% OF THE COUNTRY THINKS THE COUNTRY IS GOING IN THE WRONG\nDIRECTION AND THEY'LL LOOK AT THIS EXACTLY AS THE KIND OF\nTHING THAT THE ELITES WOULD DO TO GET HIM OUT OF THE RACE\nBECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE HIM. AND YOUR INTERVIEW WITH\nCONGRESSMAN DENT JUST UNDERLINES THAT POINT.\n>> KALEY, ARE YOU OF THE SAME OPINION THAT THERE'S NOTHING HE\nCAN DO THAT WOULD CAUSE KALEY McENANY TO CHANGE COURSE?\n>> WHAT COULD IT BE BEYOND SAYING GRAB HER BODY?\n>> EXACTLY. I'LL DEFER TO JEFFREY ON THAT.\nBUT WHAT HE SAID WAS WRONG, MICHAEL.\nTHERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. NO ONE IS DEFENDING WHAT HE\nSAID. BUT LET'S BE CLEAR.\nYOU COULD TELL A LOT ABOUT SOMEONE WHEN THEY GO THROUGH\nTIMES OF FIRE, HARD TIMES. WHAT I LEARNED ABOUT DONALD\nTRUMP WAS HE ISSUED AN APOLOGY. I DON'T THINK THE ONE VIA\nWRITING WAS ENOUGH BUT CAME OUT ON CAMERA AND VERBALLY GAVE AN\nAPOLOGY. YOU KNOW WHO COULD LEARN A LOT\nFROM THAT? THAT WAS BILL CLINTON DENYING\nHIS AFFAIR WITH MONICA LEWINSKY. HILLARY CLINTON SAYING I MADE A\nMISTAKE, BUT IT WAS COLIN POWELL'S FAULT, BUT MY AIDE'S\nFAULT. HE ROSE TO THE OCCASION, HE\nOWNED IT, HE ACCEPTED RESPONSIBILITY AND MOVING ON.\nHE NEEDS TO HAVE A HEARTFELT MOMENT DURING THIS TOWN HALL\nTOMORROW TO CONNECT WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND DOES IT ONE\nMORE TIME, BUT HE OWNED IT, THE CLINTONS COULD LEARN FROM THAT.\n>> BUT OWNING IT IN HIS CASE WAS ISSUING IN A STATEMENT,\nINITIALLY, THAT SAID TO THE EXTENT, I'VE OFFENDED ANYBODY, I\nAPOLOGIZE AND FRANKLY, IT WAS MUCH MORE ABOUT HIMSELF.\nTO THE EXTENT HE'S APOLOGIZED TO THE WOMAN TO WHOM HE WAS\nREFERRING, I STILL HAD NOT HEARD THAT.\n>> HE SAID I AM GOING TO BE A BETTER MAN TOMORROW.\nHE SAID, I REGRET MANY THINGS IN MY LIFE.\nAND THIS IS ONE OF THEM. IT WAS WRITTEN IN THE STATEMENT.\n>> MICHAEL, ALSO. >> HOW ABOUT AN APOLOGY THAT\nSAYS, I WANT TO APOLOGIZE, WAIT, GANG, HOW ABOUT AN APOLOGY THAT\nSAID I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE TO THE MARRIED WOMAN ABOUT WHOM I\nSPOKE IN SUCH LEWD TERMS? >> HE SHOULD APOLOGIZE TO\nEVERYBODY. AND I THINK IF THAT HASN'T BEEN\nENCOMPASSED IN THE PREVIOUS, HE SHOULD MAKE ANOTHER BLANKET\nAPOLOGY TO DO THAT BUT THE FRAMING OF THE QUESTION.\nWHAT WOULD IT TAKE FOR YOU NOT TO SUPPORT TRUMP?\nIT'S RARE, YOU NOTICE THE BIAS IN THAT QUESTION.\nWHAT WOULD IT TAKE FOR YOU NOT TO SUPPORT CLINTON?\nTHERE'S BIAS THERE AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, YOU'RE MISSING,\nDONALD TRUMP NEVER RAN ON THIS CONCEPT OF BEING A MORAL VIRTUE.\nWE'RE NOT ELECTING A POPE. WE'RE ELECTING A PRESIDENT.\nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW HOW DONALD TRUMP CAN SOMETIMES\nBEHAVE WHICH CAN SOMETIMES BE CRASS.\nTHEY KNEW THAT BACK IN AUGUST A YEAR AND A HALF AGO.\nBUT AFTER THEY VOTED OVER A YEARLONG PROCESS, 14 MILLION\nAMERICANS SAID, YES. FOR YOU TO CONSISTENTLY BRING\nPEOPLE ON AND SAY, HE SHOULD BE OFF THE TICKET IS\nDISENFRANCHISING THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR HIM AND DANGEROUS TO\nDO THAT. >> YOU KNOW WHAT THIS REMINDS ME\nOF IS THE CHECKER SITUATION IN 1952.\n>> THERE ARE FOUR OF US. HANG ON.\nI WANT TO PURSUE THIS WITH ANDY. ANDY, THE FEELTY OF TRUMP\nSUPPORTERS IS STUNNING. NOTHING HE CAN SAY OR DO.\n>> OKAY. IT'S NOT.\nACCORDING TO YOUR WORLD VIEW, OUR LOYALTY MAKES HIM STRANGE\nBUT NOT JUST TO DONALD TRUMP BUT THE MOVEMENT OF WHICH 14 MILLION\nPEOPLE SAID YES TO. IT'S NOT FUELTY.\nWE WANT SMALLER GOVERNMENT AND LOWER TAXES, DESTROY ISIS.\nTHAT'S ON THE TICKET. THIS ISN'T LIKE THE SAMURAI TO\nCOMMIT HARRY CAREY. >> IF HE DECIDES TO QUIT, WOULD\nYOU SUPPORT THAT DECISION? EACH OF THE THREE OF YOU?\n>> ABSOLUTELY NOT. NO.\nI WANT HIM TO STAY AND FIGHT. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT HIM TO\nFIGHT. >> CRAZY HYPOTHETICAL.\nMIGHT AS WELL ASK IF CLINTON IS GOING TO QUIT.\nHE WAS VOTED IN TO BE THE NOMINEE, HE'S GOING TO RUN AND\nSEE WHAT HAPPENS.

HE'S A DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTER.\nCONGRESSMAN, THANKS ONCE AGAIN FOR JOINING US.\nI WANT TO GET YOUR REACTION TO THE FACT THAT RIGHT NOW EVERY\nREPUBLICAN SENATOR, FEMALE REPUBLICAN SENATOR I SHOULD SAY,\nHAS WITHDRAWN THEIR SUPPORT FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nJONI ERNST OF IOWA HAS CONDEMNED TRUMP BUT NOT NECESSARILY\nWITHDRAWN HER SUPPORT. ARE THEY WRONG?\n>> I THINK THEY SHOULD CONDEMN HIM.\nTHEY HAVE ABSOLUTELY A RIGHT TO CRITICIZE THESE HORRIBLE\nCOMMENTS. BUT ALSO AS SOMEONE WHO WON THE\nNOMINEE FAIR AND SQUARE AND SOMEONE WHO IS CLOSER TO THEIR\nVALUES WHEN IT COMES TO THE SUPREME COURT, NATIONAL\nSECURITY, ECONOMIC AND IMMIGRATION SECURITY, I THINK\nTHEY ALL OWE IT TO THEMSELVES TO SIT DOWN AND TALK THIS THING\nOUT. RIGHT NOW THEY NEED TO HOLD OFF\nON MAKING ANY BIG DECISIONS, SIT DOWN WITH HIM IN THE NEXT FEW\nDAYS, AIR IT OUT, LET'S DISCUSS THIS WITHIN THE FAMILY BEHIND\nCLOSED DOORS. >> LET ME INTERRUPT,\nCONGRESSMAN, FOR A SECOND. I TAKE IT YOU PERSONALLY WERE\nALSO REPULSED BY WHAT YOU HEARD ON THAT INDIVIDEOTAPE?\n>> YES, I'M THE FATHER OF TWO GIRLS, A BROTHER OF THREE\nSISTERS AND I THINK THEY ARE INDEFENSIBLE.\nHOWEVER, I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT WHILE I DON'T SHARE ANY OF\nTHOSE COMMENTS, WHEN IT COMES TO THE ECONOMY, WHEN IT COMES TO\nNATIONAL SECURITY, THE SUPREME COURT NOMINATIONS, I THINK\nDONALD TRUMP IS FAR CLOSER TO WHAT EVERY REPUBLICAN BELIEVES\nTHAN WHAT HILLARY CLINTON BELIEVES.\n>> THE FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE, CONDOLEEZZA RICE, HAS\nBEEN VERY, VERY SILENT THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE CAMPAIGN,\nBUT TONIGHT SHE ISSUED THIS STATEMENT.\nI'LL PUT IT UP ON THE SCREEN.

AS A REPUBLICAN, I HOPE TO\nSUPPORT SOMEONE WHO HAS THE DIGNITY AND STATURE TO RUN FOR\nTHE HIGHEST OFFICE IN THE GREATEST DEMOCRACY ON EARTH.\nSHE'S SAYING FLATLY THIS MAN, DONALD TRUMP, SHOULD NOT BE\nPRESIDENT AFTER STAY SEWING OMINOUSLY SILENT ALL THESE\nMONTHS. YOUR REACTION.\n>> MECHANICALLY PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY VOTED, OVERSEAS BALLOTS\nHAVE ALREADY BEEN SENT. BALLOTS IN EACH STATE AND EVERY\nCOUNTY HAVE ALREADY BEEN PRINTED.\nSO WHEN I HEAR REPUBLICANS SAY HE SHOULD STEP OUT AND LET\nSOMEBODY ELSE RUN, BASICALLY THEY'RE THROWING IN THE TOWEL\nAND SAYING IT'S ALL OVER WITH. SO I JUST THINK FROM A PRACTICAL\nSTANDPOINT HE IS THE NOMINEE. WE NEED TO WORK TO MAKE SURE\nHE'S A BETTER NOMINEE. WE NEED TO FEEL THAT CONTRITION.\nWE NEED TO FEEL THE SINCERITY OF THE APOLOGY AND THEN SAY, YOU\nKNOW, THEN MAKE THE DECISION. AND THAT'S WHAT I HOPE PEOPLE\nWOULD DO RATHER THAN THE HEAT OF A MEDIA FRENZY OVER A WEEKEND.\n>> JACK KINGSTON, THE FORMER REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN, A STRONG\nSUPPORTER OF DONALD TRUMP, THANKS FOR JOINING US.\n>> THANK YOU, WOLF.",

SARAH, THANKS VERY MUCH.\nDONALD TRUMP IS TRYING TO PLOW AHEAD WITH THE CAMPAIGN AND WITH\nTOMORROW NIGHT'S DEBATE BUT SOME REPUBLICANS, THEY'RE WEIGHING\nSCENARIOS ABOUT THE END GAME FOR HIS CAMPAIGN.\nWE HAVE BREAKING NEWS ON THAT. I WANT TO BRING IN CHIEF\nPOLITICAL ANALYST GLORIA BORGER. WHAT ARE YOU LEARNING?\n>> WELL, THERE ARE MANY SCENARIOS BEING PLAYED OUT BY\nPEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO SEE DONALD TRUMP REMAIN THEIR\nPRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\nONE OF THE SCENARIOS THAT'S BEING PLAYED OUT BY REPUBLICAN\nPARTY ELDERS IS CONVINCING MIKE PENCE TO LEAVE THE TICKET.\n>> WOW. >> BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT IF\nMIKE PENCE WERE TO LEAVE THE TICKET IT WOULD THEN CREATE WHAT\nONE PERSON CALLED TO ME IMMEASURABLE PRESSURE THAN ON\nDONALD TRUMP TO LEAVE. I MEAN, THE PRESUMPTION IS, OF\nCOURSE, THAT MIKE PENCE WOULD BECOME THE PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE\nAT THAT PARTICULAR POINT. BUT I WAS SPEAKING TO VIN WEBER\nWHO IS A REPUBLICAN PARTY ELDER WHO WAS A JEB BUSH SUPPORTER.\nI SHOULD TELL YOU THAT. NOT A TRUMP FAN.\nBUT HE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THERE IS A LOT OF CHATTER ABOUT THIS.\nAGAIN, WOLF, THERE'S A LOT OF CHATTER ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS\nAND I A LOT OF SCENARIOS ARE BEING PLAYED OUT WITHIN THE\nREPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE NOW, WITH, YOU KNOW, REPUBLICANS\nTALKING TO EACH OTHER. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE\nHAVE SUGGESTED THIS TO MIKE PENCE BUT I DO KNOW THAT\nMESSAGES HAVE BEEN SENT TO HIM ABOUT THIS.\nAND DANA BASH HAS BEEN REPORTING THAT MIKE PENCE WAS REALLY UPSET\nBY WHAT OCCURRED. WE SAW THAT HE DIDN'T GO TO\nWISCONSIN TODAY TO REPRESENT DONALD TRUMP.\nSO, WE HAVE SOME SENSE OF MIKE PENCE'S STRONG FEELINGS ON THIS.\n>> DANA, MARK PRESTON'S WITH US, AS WELL.\nDANA, IS THERE AN INDICATION MIKE PENCE WOULD ACTUALLY DROP\nOUT AS THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL RUNNING MATE?\n>> HE'S MADE VERY CLEAR IN HIS ACTIONS AND HIS WORDS HE'S IN A\nHOLDING PATTERN. JUST LIKE A LOT OF OTHER\nREPUBLICANS ARE. BUT FOR OTHER REPUBLICANS TO BE\nIN A HOLDING PATTERN, OKAY. FOR HIM, THE GUY WHO WAS PICKED\nTO SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP AND THAT WAS SORT OF A REASON WHY THE TWO\nOF THEM ARE TOGETHER, OBVIOUSLY, HE'S A RUNNING MATE, FOR HIM TO\nSAY I'M OUT YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN ON THIS FOR NOW IS A BIG DEAL SO\nANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. WE CAN'T UNDERSCORE ENOUGH, THIS\nIS UNCHARTERED TERRITORY. I MEAN, I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW\nMANY CONVERSATIONS I HAVE HAD, I'M SURE YOU HAVE, AS WELL, WITH\nREPUBLICAN COMMITTEE MEN, STRATEGISTS, MEMBERS OF CONGRESS\nSAYING WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW THIS IS GOING TO END.\nTHERE CERTAINLY ARE SUCCESSION RULES.\nTHEY HAVE A PLAN. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS A RULE\nIN THEIR CHARTER THAT IN THE PLATFORM THAT SAYS IF SOMEBODY\nDROPS OUT THIS IS WHAT WE DO AND, YOU KNOW, WE WON'T GET INTO\nTHAT NOW BUT THAT'S A BIG, BIG, BIG IF.\n>> AND MARK PRESTON, VERY QUICKLY, BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT\nMIKE PENCE ALWAYS SAYS HE'S A RELIGIOUS CHRISTIAN FIRST,\nCONSERVATIVE SECOND, A REPUBLICAN THIRD.\nHE WAS DEEPLY OFFENDED BY THAT VIDEOTAPE.\n>> HE HAS CHILDREN AND THE FACT IS HE'S MADE HIS WHOLE CAREER IN\nCONGRESS AS A REPUBLICAN LEADER AND IS A GOVERNOR.\nYOU KNOW, BASED ON HIS SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE VIEWS.\nTHAT WAS HIS DRIVING FORCE. SOMETHING LIKE THIS CLEARLY HAS\nKNOCKED HIM OFF. HE DID A VERY GOOD JOB OF\nDEFENDING DONALD TRUMP A FEW DAYS AGO AND THIS IS A BRIDGE\nTOO FAR AND AS DANA SAID, HE IS IN A HOLDING PATTERN.\n>> HE CALLED DONALD TRUMP TODAY SAYING YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.\n>> REFUSED TO GO TO WISCONSIN. >> EXACTLY.\n>> THAT IN AND OF ITSELF IS STUNNING AND GIVING REPUBLICANS\nWHO'D LIKE TO SEE PENCE LEAVE SOME HOPE THAT MAYBE HE WOULD\nLISTEN TO THEM. >> ALL RIGHT.\nSTAND BY, GUYS. I WANT DO GET SOME MORE REACTION\nTO DONALD TRUMP'S REMARKS FROM THE LIBERTARIAN PARTY'S VICE\nPRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE, THE FORMER REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR OF\nMASSACHUSETTS, WILLIAM WELD IS JOINING US ON THE PHONE.\nTHANKS VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US. >> HEY, WOLF, NOT A BIT.\nTHANK YOU. >> ALL RIGHT.\nSO YOUR RUNNING MATE GARY JOHNSON, HE HAD HIS OWN CRISIS,\nSO-CALLED ALEPPO MOMENT AND LOST SUPPORT APPARENTLY BECAUSE HE\nDIDN'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY BUT DO YOU THINK WHAT\nDONALD TRUMP, THIS VIDEOTAPE WITH DONALD TRUMP WHAT HE SAID\nABOUT WOMEN, DO YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO HELP YOUR PARTY'S\nEFFORTS? >> WELL, IT COULD.\nYOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE SURPRISED ABOUT THIS\nVIDEOTAPE. DONALD TRUMP HAS ALREADY\nPUBLICLY CALLED WOMEN DOGS AND PIGS AS MRS. CLINTON SAID IN THE\nLAST DEBATE. AND HE CLEARLY SUBSCRIBES TO THE\nCHAT L THEORY OF WOMEN, WOMEN AS CHATTEL AND SEX OBJECTS AND I\nDON'T THINK THAT'S ANY GREAT SURPRISE.\nIT'S ONE OF -- ANY ONE OF A NUMBER OF REASONS WHY MR. TRUMP\nDOESN'T REALLY HAVE THE -- YOU KNOW, THE TEMPERAMENT, THE\nCHARACTER, THE STABILITY TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nBUT I WOULD NOT PERSONALLY JOIN THOSE WHO ARE SAYING HE NEEDS TO\nDROP OUT OF THE RACE. I THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD DO\nTHEIR JOB. WE SHOULD GO AHEAD, HAVE THE\nELECTION AND LET THE CHIPS FALL WHERE THEY MAY.\nTHAT'S WHAT WE DO. SO THAT'S MY VIEW ANYWAY.\n>> BUT NOW THAT TRUMP HAS HAD WHAT SO MANY SEE AS A\nDISQUALIFYING MOMENT, THIS VIDEOTAPE, DOES IT MAKE SENSE\nFOR VOTERS WHO HAD BEEN SUPPORTING HIM TO NOW TURN\nAROUND TO FORGET ABOUT SOME OF THEIR PREVIOUS CONCERNS\nINVOLVING THE LIBERTARIAN TICKET AND GO AHEAD AND SUPPORT YOU?\n>> WELL, THAT'S ABSOLUTELY THE CASE.\nAND GOVERNOR JOHNSON AND I PUT OUT A STATEMENT TODAY TO THAT\nEFFECT. I'VE BEEN SURPRISED, FRANKLY,\nTHAT SO MANY REPUBLICAN VOTERS STUCK WITH MR. TRUMP FOR SO LONG\nGIVEN THAT HE'S CAMPAIGNING 180 DEGREES AGAINST WHAT EVERYONE,\nREINCE PRIEBUS ON DOWN, AGREED THE PARTY NEEDED TO DO AFTER THE\n2012 ELECTION. THAT INCLUDED FREE TRADE,\nEMPHASIS ON FREE TRADE, OUTREACH TO THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY, MUCH\nMORE INVOLVEMENT OF WOMEN, REACHING OUT TO THE COMMUNITIES\nOF COLOR AND ALL OTHER COMMUNITIES OF ETHNICITY, AND\nTHAT DOES NOT SOUND LIKE DONALD TRUMP, DOES IT?\nBECAUSE HE'S GONE TOTALLY IN THE OTHER DIRECTION.\nBIT HIS THUMB AT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\n>> YOUR RUNNING MATE IS NOT GOING TO BE IN THE PRESIDENTIAL\nDEBATE TOMORROW NIGHT. GARY JOHNSON WASN'T IN THE FIRST\nPRESIDENTIAL DEBATE. DOESN'T THAT SUGGEST YOU REALLY\nHAVE VIRTUALLY NO CHANCE OF WINNING THIS ELECTION?\n>> WE DON'T HAVE A QUALITY PROBLEM BECAUSE WE BELIEVE WE\nHAVE THE BEST TICKET. TWO TWO-TERM REPUBLICAN\nGOVERNORS THAT SERVED SUCCESSFULLY AND REACHED ACROSS\nTHE AISLE AND FISCALLY SUCCESSFUL AND WELCOMING AND NOT\nMEAN SPIRITED LIKE THE REPUBLICANS, NOT SPENDING AND\nBORROWING MONEY LIKE IT WAS WATER LIKE THE DEMOCRATS.\nWE DO HAVE A QUANTITATIVE PROBLEM WHICH IS GETTING GARY\nJOHNSON'S NAME RECOGNITION UP TO 60% OR 70% INSTEAD OF 35%.\nIF WE DO THAT, GIVEN THAT HE DOESN'T HAVE THE UNFAVORABLES OF\nTHE OTHER PARTY'S CANDIDATES, HIS BALLOT POSITION SHOULD GO TO\n25% ANYWAY. MAYBE EVEN 30%.\nAND IF WE ENTERED NOVEMBER WITH 25% OR 30% WE THE LIBERTARIAN\nTICKET, I WOULD SAY WE'RE DANGEROUS TO HAVE MOMENTUM AND\nIN THE CLOSING WEEKS OF A BIG CAMPAIGN, IF YOU HAVE YOUR\nCHOICE BETWEEN MONEY AND ORGANIZATION AND MOMENTUM, ALL\nTHE PROS WILL TELL YOU YOU WANT MOMENTUM EVERY TIME.\n>> GOVERNOR, WHEN YOU HEARD TRUMP SAY IN THAT VIDEOTAPE FROM\n2005 AND I'M QUOTING HIM NOW, WHEN YOU'RE A STAR THEY LET YOU\nDO IT, YOU CAN DO ANYTHING, AND ALL THE OTHER SORDID THINGS HE\nSAID IN THAT VIDEOTAPE, WHAT DID YOU THINK?\n>> YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT THIS GUY'S NOT JUST A NARCISSIST.\nHE'S NOT JUST A MALIGNANT NARCISSIST WHO LIKES OTHER\nPEOPLE TO FAIL WHEN HE'S SUCCEEDING, HE'S WALTER MITTY.\nHE'S LOST IN HIS OWN DREAMS, IN HIS OWN HEAD.\nHE DOESN'T KNOW WHEN THE CURTAIN IS UP AND WHEN THE CURTAIN IS\nDOWN. >> YOU SAID YOU'RE GOING TO\nFOCUS YOUR ATTENTION ON ATTACKING DONALD TRUMP FOR THE\nREMAINDER OF THE CAMPAIGN, 31 DAYS TO GO.\nARE YOU ESSENTIALLY WORKING TO SUPPORT HILLARY CLINTON AS A WAY\nTO STOP DONALD TRUMP? >> NO.\nI SAID MR. TRUMP WOULD BE A BIG FOCUS OF MINE BECAUSE I THINK\nHE'S SO UNFIT FOR THE PRESIDENCY BUT I DIDN'T SAY I WOULD DO THAT\nEXCLUSIVELY. YOU KNOW?\nI THINK THE GOLDMAN SACHS TAPE THAT CAME OUT ALSO ON FRIDAY\nWHERE MRS. CLINTON SAID, WELL, I HAVE PUBLIC POSITIONS BUT I ALSO\nHAVE PRIVATE POSITIONS FOR YOUR BENEFIT, AND I THINK THAT, YOU\nKNOW, THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW MOST ABOUT WHAT REGULATION WORKS IN\nTHE FINANCIAL SECTOR ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ALREADY WORK THERE,\nNAMELY YOU. THAT'S CODE FOR I'LL BE IN YOUR\nCORNER AND MAYBE UNSTATED BUT UNMISTAKABLE IN THE BACKGROUND\nIS I APPRECIATE YOUR FINANCIAL SUPPORT ON AN ONGOING BASIS.\nTHOSE ARE ITEMS, AS WELL. WE'RE AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY\nEMPLOYER. WE'LL POINT OUT DIFFERENCES WITH\nTHE DEMOCRATS AND THE REPUBLICANS.\n>> AS YOU POINT OUT, TWICE ELECTED REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR OF\nMASSACHUSETTS. AS YOU KNOW, THE LIBERTARIAN\nPARTY PLATFORM SUPPORTING LEGALIZING PROSTITUTION AND\nCRITICS SAY THAT'S A FORM OF TREATING WOMEN LIKE A COMMODITY.\nARE YOU COMFORTABLE WITH THE PLANK IN YOUR PLATFORM?\n>> NO. NOT AT ALL.\nI'M RUNNING AS MYSELF AND NOT ON EVERY -- IN THE LIBERTARIAN\nPLATFORM AND RAN AS A REPUBLICAN I NEVER SUPPORTED THE PARTY'S\nMOVEMENT CONSERVATIVE POSITIONS ON ABORTION AND GAY RIGHTS.\nYOU MAY RECALL I WAS AN OUTLIER AS A LIBERAL ON ABORTION AND GAY\nRIGHTS AND GAY MARRIAGE FOR MANY YEARS IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\nAND, YOU KNOW, GARY AND I HAVE HAD THIS CONVERSATION MANY\nTIMES. WE'LL TAKE THE GOOD IN THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY PLATFORM -- I'M SORRY.\nTHE LIBERTARIAN PARTY PLATFORM AND NOT BOUND BY THINGS WE DON'T\nAGREE WITH. WE'RE RUNNING AS THE NOMINEES.\n>> GOVERNOR WELD, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US.\n>> THANK YOU, WOLF. >> JUST AHEAD, HERE ON THIS\nSPECIAL CNN \"NEWSROOM,\" WE'VE UNCOVERED CLIPS OF MORE CRUDE\nREMARKS BY DONALD TRUMP IN A PAST INTERVIEW ABOUT WOMEN, SEX,\nEVEN HIS OWN DAUGHTER IVANKA.

              "text": ">>> WELCOME BACK.\nI'M VICTOR BLACKWELL, LIVE FROM THE SET OF THE SECOND\nPRESIDENTIAL DEBATE. SITE OF THE DEBATE.\nI'M JUST OUTSIDE THE SET. OHIO GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH SAYS\nTHAT DONALD TRUMP'S ACTIONS AND WORDS ON THAT 2005 AUDIOTAPE ARE\nDISGUSTING. BUT UNLIKE MANY OF HIS GOP\nCOLLEAGUES, HE'S STOPPING SHORT OF CALLING FOR TRUMP TO DROP OUT\nOF THE RACE. GOVERNOR KASICH TALKED WITH OUR\nDANA BASH LATE YESTERDAY. WHILE SPEAKING OF OTHER ELECTED\nREPUBLICANS, HE SAID THIS. THEY'VE KIND OF COME TO THIS\nPARTY LATE. I APPRECIATE THEIR VIEW, BUT I\nDON'T THINK I NEED TO DO ANY MORE AT THIS POINT.\nNOBODY HAS BEEN CLEAR ABOUT THEIR FEELINGS TOWARD HIM OR NOT\nMANY AS I HAVE BEEN. YOU HAVE A REPUBLICAN NATIONAL\nCOMMITTEE AND THEY HAVE TO FIGURE THIS OUT.\nJOINING ME NOW, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR AND FORMER ROMNEY\nPUBLIC POLICY DIRECTOR AND SENIOR ADVISER TO THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN, JACK KINGSTON. GOOD MORNING TO BOTH OF YOU.\n>> LONNIE, I WANT TO START WITH YOU.\nYOU'RE HERE WITH ME. WE HEARD FROM PENNSYLVANIA\nCONGRESSMAN, CHARLIE DENT YESTERDAY, SAYING THAT REINCE\nPRIEBUS, HEAD OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION HAS TO FIX\nTHIS. IF HE CAN'T, HE NEEDS TO RETIRE.\n>> THIS IS AN REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION ISSUE.\nTHERE IS CLEARLY SOMETHING THEY CAN DO ABOUT THIS.\nIT'S ACTUALLY A GOOD THING FOR THE REPUBLICANS DOWN TICKET.\nTHAT ULTIMATELY, VICTOR IS THE BIG QUESTION.\nHOW CAN REPUBLICANS SAVE THEIR DOWN TICKET CANDIDATES?\nI THINK THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE IS LARGELY A LOST CAUSE.\nTHE ISSUE IS HOW DOES THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HANG ON TO THE\nSENATE AND THE HOUSE AND IF THERE'S A WAY FOR THE RNC TO\nENGINEER THIS AND DO THIS, THAT WOULD BE PREFERABLE.\n>> A LOST CAUSE, JACK KINGSTON, YOU SAY WHAT?\n>> I DON'T AGREE WITH MY FRIEND LANHEE ON THIS.\nTONIGHT WILL BE HUGE. HE NEEDS TO JOE APOLOGY,\nCONTRITION, AGAIN EVEN MORE AND HE HAS TO PIVOT AND SAY, YOU\nKNOW WHAT, THE QUESTION STILL BOILS DOWN TO WHO DO YOU WANT TO\nNAME THE NEXT MEMBERS OF THE SUPREME COURT?\nWHO DO YOU WANT TO DECIDE NATIONAL SECURITY AND\nIMMIGRATION SKPURT POLICY AND WHO DO YOU WANT TO RETURN JOBS?\nI THINK THAT IF DONALD TRUMP CAN DO THAT, THAT'S A BIG, BIG\nORDER. BUT IF HE CAN DO THAT TONIGHT,\nHE WILL BE IN THE BALL GAME. I THINK NEXT FEW DAYS ARE ALSO\nCRITICAL. HE'S GOT TO HAVE A FLAWLESS\nCAMPAIGN. BUT THE LOGISTICS AND AS YOU\nKNOW, SOME PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY VOTED, OVERSEAS BALLOTS MAILED.\nTHOSE BALLOTS OF EVERY SINGLE COUNTY IN THE COUNTRY HAVE BEEN\nPRINTED. THE IDEA OF SWITCHING CANDIDATES\nAT THIS POINTS, I DON'T THINK GETS YOU BACK IN THE GAME\nEITHER. HE NEEDS TO HIT THE BALL OUT OF\nTHE PARK AND SHOW THAT'S A SERIOUS CANDIDATE.\n>> THAT'S THE CALCULATION OF THE DEMOCRATS AS WELL.\nTHEY'VE DETERMINED THERE IS NO WAY THAT THIS WOULD BE A SWITCH\nTO PUT PENCE AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET AND BRING IN ANOTHER\nCANDIDATE. LET'S PUT UP ON THE SCREEN THE\nNAMES AND FACES OF MANY IN CONGRESS WHO HAVE SAID THEY WILL\nNOT VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP. I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS LIST.\nTHESE FACES HERE. A GALLERY OF REPUBLICANS WHO\nEITHER AT SOME POINT SAID THEY WERE GOING TO SUPPORT DONALD\nTRUMP OR SIMPLY SUPPORT THE NOMINEE WHOMEVER THAT WOULD BE.\nWE NOW KNOW IT'S TRUMP WHO ARE PULLING BACK.\nHOW DOES HE STOP THIS? >> I THINK, AGAIN, TONIGHT'S\nPERFORMANCE IS KEY. THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS ARE\nGOING TO BE KEY. HE STILL HAS TO GET BACK OUT\nTHERE IN THE GAME AND SAY THE DIFFERENCE BOILS DOWN TO HILLARY\nCLINTON, A THIRD TERM OF BARACK OBAMA, IF YOU WILL, OR ME.\nI AM AN ELEMENT OF -- THESE ARE ALL MY FRIENDS.\nBUT THEIR FIRST INSTINCT IS SELF-PRESERVATION.\nIF SOMEBODY COMES ALONG AND SAYS SOMETHING OR DOES SOMETHING\nTHEY'RE UNCOMFORTABLEW THEY HAVE TO PROTECT THEIR OWN PROGRAM, IF\nYOU WILL. BUT THE THING IS, HE STILL IS\nOUR NOMINEE. SO MANY OF THESE PEOPLE\nPARTICIPATED MORE IN THE PRIMARY PROCESS IF THEY WERE THAT\nUNCOMFORTABLE WITH THEM. >> HOWEVER, MANY OF THOSE\nVARIABLES THAT YOU NAMED THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS TO REITERATE\nTONIGHT WERE IN PLACE WHEN THE SENATORS AND CONGRESSMEN MADE\nTHE DECISION TO RETRACT THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE NOMINEE.\nLANHEE, TWO ENDORSEMENTS OR FACES, MITCH McCONNELL, PAUL\nRYAN. HOW LONG CAN THEY SIT\nESSENTIALLY ON THE FENCE? >> I DON'T THINK MUCH LONGER.\nI THINK THEY'VE GOT TO MAKE A DECISION.\nIT'S UNTENABLE TO SAY, I DON'T AGREE WITH WHAT DONALD TRUMP\nSAYS, I DON'T LIKE WHAT HE SAID. BUT BY THE WAY, I THINK HE\nSHOULD BE THE LEADER OF OF THE FREE WORLD.\nBOTH THE SPEAKER AND THE LEADERS HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS OVER THE\nNEXT FEW DAYS. I THINK THE DEBATE, TONIGHT'S\nDEBATE WILL BE CRITICALMENT DONALD TRUMP HAS AN OPPORTUNITY\nTO SHOW CONTRITION, GENUINE CONTRITION IN THE FIRST FIVE\nMINUTES OF THE DEBATE TO POTENTIALLY TURN THINGS AROUND.\nI THINK HE'S TOO FAR GONE.

WE'LL SEE.\n>> WELL, NOW WITH SEEMINGLY NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE, WILL THAT\nBE HIS STRATEGY FOR TONIGHT? WE'VE ALREADY SEEN HIS\nRETWEETING OF TWEETS FROM ONE NEAT AT THAT BRODERICK WHO\nACCUSED BILL CLINTON OF SEXUAL ASSAULT.\nWE'RE JOINED BY SENIOR EDITOR FROM THE ATLANTIC.\nRON, YOU'VE NEVER SEEN SO MANY SENATORS DEFECT FROM A\nREPUBLICAN NOMINEE. >> NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN ANYTHING\nLIKE YESTERDAY IN AT LEAST 100 YEARS.\nTHE PREVIOUS 24 HOUR PERIOD WHERE AS MANY REPUBLICAN LEADERS\nABANDONED THEIR PARTY'S PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE, YOU'D HAVE\nTO GO BACK TO THE DAY IN JUNE, 1912, WHEN THEODORE ROOSEVELT\nWALKED OUT OF THE PARTY. WE'RE NOW UP TO 1/3 OF\nREPUBLICAN SENATORS SAYING THEY'RE NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR\nTHEIR PARTY'S NOMINEE. THAT'S UNPRESS DEPARTMENTED EVEN\nGOING BACK TO 1912. THE CLOSEST MODERATE EQUIVALENT\nWOULD BE BARRY GOLDWATER. EVEN THEN IT WAS A HANDFUL, FIVE\nOR SIX REPUBLICAN SENATORS CLUSTERED IN THE NORTHEAST.\nTHE FORMER PRESIDENT, DWIGHT EISENHOWER, CUT AN AD FOR HIM.\nRICHARD NIXON CUT AN AD FOR HIM. THE PARTY WAS A PARAGON OF\nUNITY. I THINK THIS IS REALLY -- SINCE\nTHE ROOSEVELT/TAFT SCHISM OVER A CENTURY AGO, THIS WOULD BE THE\nBIGGEST FISSURE IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\n>> WE'VE PUT UP A GALLERY OF THOSE FROM THE HOUSE AND SENATE\nWHO SAID THEY WILL NOT SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP, BUT LET'S GO TO\nTHE TWO INDIVIDUALS. >> RIGHT.\n>> LOOK AT THIS. >> YES.\n>> LET'S GO TO THE TWO INDIVIDUALS.\nWE HAVE UP THERE ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER WHO WASN'T A\nTRUMP SUPPORTER FROM THE BEGINNING.\nMITCH McCONNELL AND PAUL RYAN. >> YES.\n>> RESPECTIVELY MAJORITY LEADER AND SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE.\nPEOPLE ARE WAITING FOR THEM TO TAKE A SIDE HERE, TO\nDEFINITIVELY SAY I'M STILL WITH TRUMP OR I CAN NO LONGER SUPPORT\nHIM. >> ESPECIALLY AGONIZING FOR PAUL\nRYAN BECAUSE TRUMP IS AGAINST HIS VISION FOR THE PARTY.\nRYAN SAYS THIS IS TAKING CONSERVATIVE VISION.\nHE'S WORRYING PARTY IS DEFINING THE PARTY AS A PARTY OF WHITE\nRACIAL BACKLASH. IN JUNE WITH THE DECISION OVER\nTHE JUDGE, HE IS ENGAGED IN THE TEXTBOOK DEFINITION OF RACISM.\nTHE PROBLEM THEY HAVE IS THEY FEAR IF TRUMP TOTALLY COLLAPSES,\nTHAT REPUBLICAN TURNOUT WILL COLLAPSE AND COST THEM THE\nMAJORITY IN THE HOUSE AND BE SENATE.\nTHEY AGREE WITH TRUMP ON A CERTAIN SET OF CORE ECONOMIC\nISSUES, TAXES, REGULATION, APPEALING OBAMACARE.\nTHEY ARE IN A HORRIBLE PLACE BUT IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE THAT PAUL\nRYAN CAN GET ALL THE WAY TO THE ELECTION IN PARTICULAR WITHOUT\nMORE DISTANCE FROM DONALD TRUMP WHOSE VISION FOR THE PARTY IN\nADDITION TO THE PERSONAL ISSUES, HIS VISION FOR THE PARTY HE\nFUNDAMENTALLY REJECTS. >> DONALD TRUMP WOULD HAVE GONE\nINTO THIS DEBATE WITH SOME SIGNIFICANT RETORQUAL AMMUNITION\nAT LEAST WITH THE RELEASE FROM WIKILEAKS, THE HACKING OF JOHN\nPODESTA. THE CLAIM AGAINST TRADE AFTER\nWHAT WE HEARD FROM BERNIE SANDERS.\n>> TRADE WAS THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE MOMENT FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON. SHE WAS CAUGHT IN A NO MAN'S\nLAND WHERE DONALD TRUMP WAS SLAMMING AND A HALF AT THAT, WAS\nSLAMMING THE TPP AND SHE DEPARTMENT WANT TO DEFEND THEM\nAND SHE DIDN'T COMPLETELY, YOU KNOW, RENOUNCE THEM.\nTHE BIG REVELATION FROM THOSE WAS THAT SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT\nTHE POSSIBILITY OF THE HEMISPHERE WIDE FREE TRADE ZONE\nSOME DAY. >> OPEN BORDERS, OPEN TRADE.\n>> OPEN BORDERS, OPEN TRADE GOING THROUGH ALL NORTH AND\nSOUTH AMERICA. BILL CLINTON TALKED ABOUT THAT\nAS WELL IN 1994. THE BEGINNING OF THE TPP WAS\nBILL CLINTON TALKING ABOUT A FREE TRADE ZONE IN ASIA, A HEM\nM DCH HEMISPHERIC FREE TRADE ZONE.\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN CAUGHT OUT ON A LIMB ON A POLICY I'M\nNOT SURE SHE FULLY BELIEVES IN AND IT'S AT ODDS FOR PEOPLE\nVOTING FOR DEMOCRATS. >> DOES THAT RESONATE AT ALL\nTONIGHT? >> NO.\n>> CAN YOU MAKE THAT STICK? >> NO.\nIT'S GOING TO BE SECONDARY. THE TOWN HALL DEBATES ARE A\nLITTLE MORE DIFFUSE, THEY'RE INTERESTING, THEY'RE A LITTLE\nBIT OF FIREWORKS THAT GO OFF ALL OVER THE PLACE.\nIT'S TRADITIONALLY HARDER TO LEVEL THE PERSONAL ATTACKS AT\nTHE TOWN HALL DEBATES. VOTERS GET UP AND WANT TO KNOW\nWHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO TO MAKE YOUR LIVES BETTER.\nI THINK IT WILL BE SOMEWHAT RELEVANT.\nWE HAVE AN EXTRAORDINARY BACK DROP.\nIT'S HARD TOW BELIEVE THAT WHAT PAUL RYAN CALLED THE ELWILL HE\nFAPT IN THE ROOM IS NOT GOING TO LAND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STAGE.\n>> ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE YOU.",

I'VE GOTTEN A LOT OF FLAK FROM\nMY TRUMP-SUPPORTING FRIENDS FOR THE THINGS THAT I'VE SAID.\nBUT IT'S BEEN VERY CLEAR FOR A LONG TIME THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS\nA STRATEGY THAT CAN'T WIN FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\nPUT ASIDE THE VILE COMMENTS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HIM HAVING\nMADE 11 YEARS AGO. HE'S ALIENATED THE\nFASTEST-GROWING ETHNIC GROUPS IN THE COUNTRY, ONE POLL SHOWS HIM\nGETTING LESS THAN 20% OF THE VOTES OF PEOPLE UNDER THE AGE OF\n30, HE'S HAD NO SUCCESS IN BUILDING SUPPORT AMONG WOMEN.\nTHIS IS NOT A STRATEGY THAT CAN WIN FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, IT\nSHOULD HAVE CLEAR A LONG TIME AGO.\nI'M GLAD THAT PAUL RYAN HAS TAKEN THE APPROACH HE'S TAKEN.\nIT'S NOT EASY FOR HIM AND WON'T BE EASY FOR THESE OTHER\nREPUBLICAN CANDIDATES BUT THIS IS A SITUATION WE'RE IN.\nWE CAN'T GIVE AWAY THE WHOLE FUTURE OF THE PARTY FOR FEAR OF\nALIENATING TRUMP SUPPORTERS. >> AND THERE'S A PICTURE THEY'VE\nRELEASED OF TRUMP ON THE PLANE CALLING PENCE, HE'S SURROUND BY\nRUDY GIULIANI AND OTHER TOP ADVISORS, SARA, SHOULD HE GO\nAFTER BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON TONIGHT ON SEXUAL PERSONAL\nISSUES? >> I THINK A LOT OF THE\nCOMPLAINTS THAT YOU HEAR FROM REPUBLICANS ACROSS THE COUNTRY\nTODAY IS THAT INITIAL APOLOGY IF YOU WERE OFFENDED, HIS SECOND\nVIDEO DIDN'T SEEM SINCERE. IF HE ADDRESSES THIS IN A\nSINCERE WAY, HE CAN MOVE ON TO OTHER ISSUES.\nI'M NOT SURE HE'S CAPABLE OF DOING THAT.\nON THE OTHER HAND, THOUGH, WHAT I THINK YOU SEE A LACK OF\nWILLINGNESS, A LACK OF COURAGE ON DEMOCRATS' PART TO\nACKNOWLEDGE HILLARY CLINTON'S FLAWS.\nREPUBLICANS ACROSS THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW ARE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT\nDONALD TRUMP IS AN INCREDIBLY FLAWED CANDIDATE AND YET YOU SEE\nDEMOCRATS STANDING BY HILLARY CLINTON WHEN THESE SPEECHES HAVE\nCOME OUT WHERE SHE BASICALLY SAYS SHE LIES TO VOTERS AND ONLY\nTELLS THE TRUTH BEHIND CLOSED DOORS.\nSO I THINK IT WOULD BE WISE FOR DONALD TRUMP TO POINT OUT THAT\nHYPOCRISY ON THE LEFT BUT HE'S GOT TO THREAD THAT NEEDLE AND\nHE'S NOT A GREAT SEWER SO FAR. >> SARA FLORES, VIN WEBER,\nTHANKS SO MUCH.",

IMMIGRATION IS OUT OF CONTROL.\nBORDER PATROL TELLS US THAT IN AUGUST A RECORD NUMBER CROSSED\nOUR BORDER. AND 10,000 SYRIAN REFUGEES WERE\nBROUGHT INTO THIS COUNTRY. SYRIAN REFUGEES ABOUT WHO WE\nKNOW NOTHING. SYRIAN REFUGEES BIG ENOUGH TO\n OWN TOWN.

MONEY AND FUNDING IS SO CRITICAL\nIN THIS ELECTION. YOU'RE REPORTING THAT SOME\nREPUBLICAN SOURCES ARE TALKING ABOUT THE OPTION OF ENDING\nSOMETHING KNOWN AS THE JOINT FUNDING AGREEMENT, WHAT IS THAT\nAND WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE? WHAT WOULD THE IMPLICATIONS BE?\n>> THIS IS THE LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE RNC AND THE CAMPAIGN\nTO JOINTLY FUNDRAISE. THE WORD I KEPT HEARING ALL DAY\nWAS DISGUSTED AND FRUSTRATED THAT REPUBLICAN SOURCES SAY ARE\nENDING THEM. A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THE\nMONEY THEY RAISE GOES TO TRUMP AND A CERTAIN AMOUNT GOES TO THE\nRNC. THE REASON FOR THIS IS TWO\nWORDS, DOWN BALLOT. IF THEY ENDED IT, THE RNC COULD\nFOCUS FUNDRAISING EXCLUSIVELY ON THE CRITICAL DOWN BALLOT RACES\nAND ENCOURAGE DONORS WHO ARE NO LONGER WRITING CHECKS.\nAFTER THIS WEEK, MAYBE EVEN LESS INCLINED TO WRITE CHECKS.\nIT COULD GIVE THEM LEVERAGE WITH TRUMP, THE RNC, AND ALSO MIGHT\nHELP THEM FINANCIALLY WITH D DOWN BALLOT RACES THAT THEY'RE\nDESPERATE ABOUT. >> ALSO TONIGHT, JAMIE WE'LL SEE\nWHAT HAPPENS ON THAT FRONT, ALSO TONIGHT, WE'RE HEARING REALLY\nFOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIS RACE FROM CONDOLEEZZA RICE.\n>> RIGHT THERE ARE SOME FNAMES YOU SHOWED UP THERE ON THE CHART\nTHAT WERE NOT A SURPRISE. CONDOLEEZZA RICE SAID DONALD\nTRUMP SHOULD NOT BE PRESIDENT. I HOPE TO SUPPORT SOMEONE THAT\nHAS THE DIGNITY AND STATURE TO RUN FOR THE HIGHEST OFFICE IN\nTHE GREATEST DEMOCRACY ON EARTH. I CAN TELL YOU THIS WAS STUNNING\nTO THOSE OF US WHO KNOW HER. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN REACHING OUT TO\nHER. THIS ENTIRE CAMPAIGN, AND SHE\nSAID I'M NOT GOING TO GET INVOLVED, I'M STAYING OUT OF\nTHIS, THAT SHE WOULD SPEAK OUT IS REALLY A BIG DEAL.\nFOR HER TO GET INVOLVED IN THIS. >> AND SHE BEGINS WITH ENOUGH\nAND MANY EXCLAMATION MARKS. THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE HEARD\nFROM CONDOLEEZZA RICE THE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN.\nWE HAVE MUCH MORE AHEAD THIS HOUR.\nSPECIAL REPORTING LIVE HERE FROM WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY IN ST.\nLOUIS.

AND THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS\nIN SUCH A CRISIS THAT IN EFFECT THE RNC LEADERSHIP IS TAKING A\nTIME-OUT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO NEXT.\nRNC LEADERS I'M TOLD ARE WAITING TO SEE IF ALL OF THESE DEFEC\nDEFECTIONS ARE A TIDAL WAVE AND GO FURTHER OR IF, FRANKLY, THERE\nARE MORE TAPES TO COME OUT AND ALSO WAITING TO SEE HOW DONALD\nTRUMP HANDLES HIMSELF TOMORROW NIGHT AT THE DEBATE.\nON A DIFFERENT NOTE, THE RNC, I'M TOLD BY OUR SOURCES, IS\nCONSIDERING HOW TO HANDLE THE FUTURE OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP\nWITH TRUMP FOR THE NEXT MONTH. TRUMP RELIES ON THE RNC NOT ONLY\nFOR HIS GROUND GAME IN STATES BUT HE'S RELYING ON THEM\nFINANCIALLY. RIGHT NOW, WE KNOW THE RNC AND\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAVE A LEGAL AGREEMENT FOR JOINT\nFUND-RAISING. THOSE VICTORY FUNDS WE KEEP\nHEARING ABOUT IN DIFFERENT STATES AROUND THE COUNTRY.\nBUT MY GOP SOURCES HAVE TOLD ME TODAY THAT THERE'S NOW AN OPTION\nUNDER CONSIDERATION TO CHANGE THAT RELATIONSHIP.\nIN EFFECT, TO STOP SHARING THE MONEY WITH TRUMP AND TO\nCONCENTRATE ON RAISING MONEY FOR THOSE CRITICAL DOWN BALLOT\nRACES, CONGRESSIONAL RACES, STATEWIDE RACES, WOLF.\n>> YEAH MY GANGEL WITH GOOD REPORTING, AS USUAL.\nTHANK YOU. I WANT TO BRING BACK POLITICAL\nREPORTER SARA MURRAY JOINING US FROM NEW YORK, MARK PRESTON IS\nWITH US HERE IN ST. LOUIS AS ARE COMMENT TAYLORS TRUMP SUPPORTER\nJEFFREY LORD AND HILLARY ROSEN, HILLARY CLINTON SUPPORTER.\n80 MILLION PEOPLE POTENTIALLY COULD BE WATCHING THE SECOND\nPRESIDENTIAL DEBATE TOMORROW NIGHT.\nWHAT DO WE EXPECT TO HEAR? WHAT ARE YOU HEARING FROM YOUR\nSOURCES ABOUT HOW HILLARY CLINTON WILL COME OUT?\n>> SWINGING. RIGHT FROM THE TOP.\nFROM WHAT WE UNDERSTAND, SHE PLANS TO ADDRESS THIS RIGHT AT\nTHE TOP OF THE DEBATE IN WHAT FORM OR FASHION WE DON'T KNOW.\nTHEY PURPOSELY LEFT HER DOWN TODAY.\nTHEY DIDN'T WANT A PUBLIC STATEMENT OR APPEARANCE OR AN\nINTERVIEW. THEY WANT TO HIT IT HOME AS YOU\nSAID 80 PLUS MILLION PEOPLE COULD BE WATCHING BREAKING\nRECORDS IN THIS DEBATE. WE SAW ABOUT 84 MILLION WATCHED\nLAST DEBATE. I CAN'T IMAGINE WE WON'T SEE\nMORE PEOPLE WATCHING TOMORROW NIGHT AND BILL CLINTON WILL BE\nHERE AT THE DEBATE. QUESTION IS, WILL HE BE IN THE\nDEBATE HALL OR WATCHING IT FROM A HOLD ROOM?\nIN THE DEBATE ROOM AND DONALD TRUMP GOES AFTER HIM, IMAGINE\nWHAT COULD HAPPEN. >> SARA MURRAY, YOU HAVE NEW\nINFORMATION ON MIKE PENCE, THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL RUNNING MATE\nOF DONALD TRUMP ON THE TRAVEL SCHEDULE.\nTHEY PUT IT OUT. WHAT ARE YOU LEARNING?\n>> A LOT IS MADE OF MIKE PENCE NOT GOING TO WISCONSIN TO\nREPRESENT DONALD TRUMP THERE AND THE CAMPAIGN JUST ADVISED TRAVEL\nSCHEDULE FOR PENCE, IT GOES THROUGH WEDNESDAY.\nIT'S LIGHT ON DETAILS. IT DOES INCLUDE THE STATES HE'LL\nBE GOING TO AND CLEAR THAT THE CAMPAIGN WANTS TO SEND THE\nINDICATION THAT MIKE PENCE IS NOT THINKING OF DROPPING OFF THE\nTICKET. NOW, OBVIOUSLY, WE'RE HEARING\nOTHER THINGS. GORE GLORIA, DANA, HEARING FROM\nTHE SOURCES, CHATTER, THAT COULD BE DEPENDENT ON HOW DONALD TRUMP\nDOES IN THE DEBATE AND DOESN'T MEAN IF TOMORROW NIGHT IS A\nCATAS CATASTROPHE, HE COULDN'T CHANGE\nHIS MIND AND CANCEL EVENTS. WE SAW THAT HAPPEN TODAY AND FOR\nNOW THEY'RE TRYING TO CALM THE WATERS GOING INTO TOMORROW.\n>> WAIT. >> JEFFLY LORD, WE ARE JUST\nLEARNING THAT SENATOR ROB PORTMAN OF OHIO WITHDRAWN\nENDORSEMENT, SUPPORT OF DONALD TRUMP.\nTHAT'S A BIG LOSS IN A KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE LIKE OHIO.\nWE SAY IT ALL TIME. NO REPUBLICAN HAS EVER WON THE\nWHITE HOUSE WITHOUT OHIO. >> WELL, YEAH.\nTHE QUESTION YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF IS WILL THE TRUMP\nSUPPORTERS IN OHIO TAKE IT OUT ON ROB PORTMAN?\nTHIS CUTS BOTH WAYS HERE FOR THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND\nGOVERNORS WHO ARE RUNNING FOR ELECTION.\nIF THEY ABANDON THE NOMINEE, IT IS EASY TO SEE THAT SOME OF THE\nTRUMP SUPPORTERS WILL ABANDON THEM.\n>> YOU RESPECT ROB PORTMAN. >> SURE, SURE.\nI DON'T THINK HE WAS ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT DONALD TRUMP\nTO BEGIN WITH AND WE GET TO THE INSIDER/OUTSIDER THING.\nWOLF, FOUR YEARS AGO YOU SAW MITT ROMNEY, AN OUTSIDER IN\nESSENCE, MADE INTO THE DEVIL ABOUT THIS TIME.\nTHIS HAPPENS TO REPUBLICAN NOMINEES.\nCORNUALLY THIS IS THE BELIEF IN CONSERVATIVE CIRCLES THAT THIS\nHAPPENS TO EVERY REPUBLICAN NOMINEE, WE REACH A CERTAIN\nPOINT AND A CRISIS THAT, YOU KNOW, PAINTS THEM AS TERRIBLE\nPEOPLE. FOR MITT ROMNEY, THAT\nSTEELWORKER'S WIFE AND SUP SUPPOSEDLY PULLED THE INSURANCE\nON. DOG ON THE ROOF.\nTHIS KIND OF THING. THAT'S A BELIEF THAT ANY\nREPUBLICAN NOMINEE FACES SOMETHING LIKE THIS, THIS IS THE\nDONALD TRUMP VERSION OF IT. >> REMEMBER THE REPUBLICANS SOME\nOF THEM DID TO THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE IN 2008 AND 2012.\nTHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN BARACK OBAMA.\n>> DOING WHAT TO HIM? >> REMEMBER THE SMEARS AND THE\nACCUSATIONS CONTINUED AND CONTINUED AND CONTINUED?\n>> I JUST THINK, WOLF, SO MUCH OF THIS --\n>> DONALD TRUMP WAS THERE? >> YOU MEAN TALKING ABOUT THE\nBIRTHER SITUATION? >> AMONG OTHER THINGS.\n>> YEAH. I DON'T -- I MEAN, I UNDERSTAND\nPEOPLE WANT TO PEG THIS AS RACIST.\nI DON'T BELIEVE IT IS. I MEAN, WHEN YOU HAVE FIVE WHITE\nGUYS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OVER THE COURSE OF A CENTURY, ONE IS\nSITTING REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT WHO ARE ACCUSED OF EXACTLY THE SAME\nTHING, NOT BEING BORN IN AMERICA, NOTHING RACIST ABOUT\nTHAT. >> KEY THING FOR GUYS LIKE ROB\nPORTMAN, THOUGH, WHETHER THIS IS TOO LITTLE TOO LATE.\nWHETHER PEOPLE IN OHIO FEEL LIKE ROB PORTMAN HAS STUCK WITH\nDONALD TRUMP LONG ENOUGH THAT TED STRICKLAND FOR SENATE CAN\nSTILL WRAP DONALD TRUMP AROUND ROB PORTMAN.\n>> HE WAS AHEAD IN THE POLLS. >> HE WAS AND WE'LL SEE IF IT\nCHANGES -- >> BY A LOT, THOUGH.\nDEMOCRATS HAVE WRITTEN OFF OHIO. >> YOU LOOK AT PENNSYLVANIA WITH\nPAT TOOMEY AND WISCONSIN, NEW HAMPSHIRE.\nTHAT'S KEY RACE. >> OHIO --\n>> YOU FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO DO THIS WEEK WHICH IS WE ARE GOING\nTO WORK HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE KNOW THAT MIKE PENCE IS\nNOT ACCEPTABLE EITHER. BECAUSE MIKE PENCE --\n>> SEE? >> WELL, THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.\nMIKE PENCE IS AS BAD FOR WOMEN'S POLICIES AS DONALD TRUMP IS FOR\nWOMEN'S BODIES. THAT, YOU KNOW, HE WAS THE FIRST\nGUY WHO INTRODUCED THE BILL TO DEFUND PAPE.\nHE WAS AGAINST REPRODUCTIVE CHOICE EVEN IN THE CASE OF RAPE.\nHE WAS WITHIN OF THOSE GUYS IN THE HOUSE WHO TRIED TO REDEFINE\nRAPE TO PREVENT ALL ABORTION. SO THIS IS A VERY RADICAL\nCONSERVATIVE WHO'S NOT BEEN A FRIEND TO WOMEN AND YOU WILL SEE\nDEMOCRATS MAKE SURE THAT HE DOESN'T TURN INTO AN ACCEPTABLE\nALTERNATIVE TO DONALD TRUMP. >> GO AHEAD.\n>> WELL, JUST VERY QUICKLY, IF DONALD TRUMP WERE TO STEP DOWN\nAND MIKE PENCE WERE TO BECOME THE NOMINEE, THAT'S THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY ESSENTIALLY SAYING WE HAVE GIVEN UP ON THE\nWHITE HOUSE. THERE'S NO WAY THAT HE COULD\nCOME UP AND WIN THE RACE. ALL THE MONEY GOES INTO THE\nUNITED STATES SENATE AND GOES TO THE U.S. HOUSE.\nMIKE PENCE TRIES TO GO IN TO CALM THE SHIP AND RUN IN 2020.\nTHAT'S WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. >> EVERYBODY, STAY WITH US.\nSTAND BY. WE HAVE A LOT MORE COMING UP.\nTHIS REMARKABLE STORY CONTINUES WITH MORE BREAKING NEWS RIGHT\nHERE IN THE CNN NEWSROOM. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. \u00e2\u0099\u00aa",

YOU ARE LOOKING AT SUPPORTERS.\nLOOK AT THAT, THIS IS IN THE MIDDLE OF FIFTH AVENUE OUTSIDE\nTRUMP TOWERS. SUPPORTERS CHANTING DONALD\nTRUMP, DONALD TRUMP, USA! USA!\nAS DONALD TRUMP DECIDES TWA HIS NEXT MOVE IS.\nLET'S GO TO DANA BASH. SHE IS WORKING HER SOURCES.\nSHE IS ON THE PHONE WITH ME. THIS COMES AMID A NUMBER OF\nLEADING REPUBLICANS CALLING FOR MIKE PENCE, THE LEADING RUNNING\nMATE, TO TAKE THE TOP OF THIS TICKET.\nDANA, WHAT ARE YOU HEARING? >> Reporter: HEY, POPPY, ONE OF\nTHE POST-INTERESTING THINGS I HAVE BEEN TOLD IN THE LAST FEW\nHOURS IS ABOUT A PHONE CALL MIKE PENCE HAD WITH DONALD TRUMP.\nWHEN HE EXPLAINED THAT HE DID NOT FEEL THAT HE COULD GO TO\nWISCONSIN TO REPRESENT DONALD TRUMP AT THE BIG REPUBLICAN\nUNITY EVENT THAT TRUMP WAS INITIALLY SUPPOSED TO GO TO\nBEFORE HE WAS DISINVITED BY THE HOUSE SPEAKER.\nI AM TOLD PENCE TOLD THIS TRUMP EARLIER IN THIS CALL WAS THE\nONLY EFFECTIVE PERSON TO SPEAK ON THIS IS TRUMP, HIMSELF.\nAND THAT PENCE SAID, HE TOLD TRUMP, IF HE WENT TO WISCONSIN,\nIT WOULD INTERFERE WITH THAT. SO THAT'S KIND OF A DIPLOMATIC\nWAY OF SAYING, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN, DUDE.\nTHIS IS YOUR PROBLEM. THIS IS ABOUT YOU.\nTHIS IS ABOUT YOUR CHARACTER. THIS IS ABOUT YOUR ACTION.\nNEVER MIND WORDS AND IT'S PRETTY CLEAR FROM THAT CONVERSATION,\nFROM THE FACT THAT HE ISSUED A TOUGH STATEMENT AND FROM THE\nFACT THAT HE HAS NOT WANTED TO BE OUT THERE ON BEHALF OF TRUMP,\nWHILE THIS KIND OF SHAKES OUT, IT'S QUITE TELLING.\nTHIS IS A GUY WHO WAS PUT ON THE TICKET BY DONALD TRUMP.\n>> DANA, THIS IS ALSO THE GUY THAT DONALD TRUMP BRAGGED APT,\nLOOK AT HIM. LOOK AT HIM, THIS IS MY FIRST\nHIRE, DID I MAKE A GOOD DECISION?\nTHOUSAND HE IS NOT GOING TO STAND NEXT TO HIM IN THE PLACE\nOF PAUL RYAN, HE ISSUED A STATEMENT SAYING HE CAN'T STAND\nBY OR DEFEND ANY OF THOSE WORDS. DANA, THE QUESTION BECOMES, WHAT\nDOES MIKE PENCE DO? >> YEAH.\nI DON'T THINK MIKE PENCE KNOWS THE ANSWER TO WHAT MIKE PENCE\nDOES, IS HE GOING TO WATCH AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH DONALD\nTRUMP? WHETHER HE GOES FURTHER AND\nTRYING TO REDEEM HIMSELF? PRESUMABLY AT THE NEXT\nOPPORTUNITY FOR THAT IS GOING TO BE IN FRONT OF TENS OF MILLIONS\nOF PEOPLE ON THE DEBATE STAGE TOMORROW NIGHT.\nBUT JUST TO GET A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT, MIKE PENCE IS THE\nULTIMATE RUNNING MATE AND HAS BEEN.\nHE HAS BEEN A BEAUTIFUL SOLDIER, HAS BEEN OUT CAMPAIGNING, YOU\nKNOW, RELENTLESSLY FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nMORE IMPORTANTLY, I EACH SAID THIS TO HIM, POPPY, IN AN\nINTERVIEW RECENTLY, HE'S BEEN AMONG CONSERVATIVES.\nMANY IN THE ESTABLISHMENT, MANY SKEPTICS OF DONALD TRUMP, TRYING\nTO GO OUT AND REAP OUT TO GOVERNOR KASICH, FOR EXAMPLE,\nOTHERS ON CAPITOL HILL, TRYING TO SAY, WELL, THIS IS NOT -- I\nKNOW IT'S A DIFFERENT SIDE OF DONALD TRUMP.\nHE IS SAID TO ME PRIVATELY AND PUBLICLY, THIS IS A GUY I HAVE\nGOTTEN TO KNOW. HE'S REALLY WONDERFUL.\nHE'S OUT FROM ON A LIMB. AND THE FACT THAT HE IS BREAKING\nSO PUBLIC HE IS REALLY TELLING. HE IS ALSO VERY INHERENTLY AND\nHAS BEEN FOR YEARS AND HE TALKED ABOUT HIM ON THE DEBATE STAGE\nVERY RELIGIOUS. HE IS A CHRISTIAN AND CONSCIOUS\nAND A POLITICAL THING. HE'S A TRUE CHRISTIAN\nCONSERVATIVE. >> DANA, YOU ALSO SPOKE WITH\nJOHN KASICH, GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH OF OHIO, WHO WAS ONE OF\nTHE LAST ONES STANDING IN THIS REPUBLICAN PRIMARY AND HE HAS\nNEVER COME OUT AND ENDORSED DONALD TRUMP.\nHE GOT A LOT OF GRIEF FROM SOME OF HIS OWN PARTY SAYING WHY\nAREN'T YOU GETTING BEHIND OUR CANDIDATE?\nWHAT DID KASICH SAY? >> Reporter: I JUST SPOKE WITH\nHIM ON THE PHONE, POPPY, I CALLED HIM TO SPEAK TO YOU,\nLOOK, HE REENFORCED WHAT HE SAID EARLIER TODAY IN A FORMAL\nSTATEMENT THAT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR INCIDENT,\nWHICH IS WHAT HE CALLS, YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY, HORRIBLE.\nIT'S AN ACCUMULATION OF ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER AND, YOU\nKNOW, I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT HE DIDN'T EXPLICITLY SAY HE\nFEELS VINDICATED, IT'S CERTAINLY THE BYE-BYE GOD FROM HIM HE\nDOES. IN FACT, I SAID TO HIM, DO YOU\nBELIEVE THAT DONALD TRUMP SHOULD GET OUT OF THE RACE, THAT HE\nSHOULD BE OFF THE TICKET, LIKE SO MANY OF YOUR FELLOW\nREPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN SAYING ALL DAY TODAY?\nAND HIS ANSWER WAS, YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT MY JOB.\nI'M NOT ON THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE.\nHE ACTUALLY SAID SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT ARE LATE TO THE\nPARTY. HE SAID THEY'VE COME LATE TO THE\nPARTY. HE SAID I APPRECIATE THAT.\nBUT THIS IS WHY HE SAID HE HAS BEEN ADAMANT THAT DONALD TRUMP\nIS NOT THE RIGHT PERSON FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY OR THE COUNTRY.\nSO HE SAID EXPLICITLY, HE IS NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR HILLARY\nCLINTON, THAT'S SOMETHING HE MADE EARLIER IN THE STATEMENT,\nPROBABLY JUST LEAVE THE TOP OF THE BALLOT BLANK.\nHE'S OUT CAMPAIGNING IN WASHINGTON STATE RIGHT NOW AND\nWILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. POPPY, YOU SPENT TIME TALKING TO\nVOTERS IN HIS STATE OF OHIO, GOVERNOR KASICH'S STATE OF OHIO.\n>> RIGHT. >> Reporter: WHICH DONALD TRUMP\nIS DOING PRETTY WELL. I ASKED KASICH, DO YOU THINK HE\nCOULD WIN THERE? I SAID, DO YOU THINK THIS WILL\nCHANGE THE TRAJECTORY FOR TRUMP IN YOUR STATE OF OHIO?\nHE SAY HE DOESN'T THINK ANYBODY WHO IS AS MUCH OF A DIVIDER\nCOULD WIN OHIO. HE SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT, MAYBE\nPEOPLE WILL JUSTIFY THIS. WE'LL SEE.\n>> YEAH. HAY, DANA, BEFORE I LET YOU GO,\nI WAS JUST THINKING YOU THIS WILL PLAY OUT TOMORROW NIGHT ON\nTHE DEBATE STAGE, BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN ON THE DEBATE STAGE.\nYOU HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE QUESTIONERS IN A NUMBER OF\nDEBATES IN THE PRIMARY. WHAT DOES HILLARY CLINTON DO\nWHEN SHE WALKS OUT, IS IT A SCENE WE SAW IN THE FIRST\nDEBATE, DOES SHE WALK ACROSS THE STAGE, THEY SMILE AT ONE ANOTHER\nOR SHAKE HANDS OR DOES SHE NOT DO THAT IN THE WAKE OF THIS\nTAPE? >> Reporter: MY UNDERSTANDING IS\nTHEY'RE WORKING ON TRYING TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION RIGHT NOW\nAS THEY'RE HUCHGERRED DOWN DOING DEBATE PREP INSIDE TEAM CLINTON,\nTRYING TO PHYSICAL OUT HOW TO ADDRESS IT.\nYOU KNOW, LAST TEN DAYS AGO WHENEVER THE FIRST DEBATE WAS,\nAS YOU SAID, THEY DID SMILE, EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE PROBABLY\nGRITING THEIR TEETH. AND.\n>> RIGHT. >> Reporter: AND AS THE ISSUE\nWAS OUT THERE, BUT NOT AS MUCH AS YOU KNOW, IT WAS MOSTLY THE\nWHOLE QUESTION OF TRUMP AND WOMEN WAS A RESULT OF AD-LIBING,\nRELIKEING IT AT THE END OF THAT DEBATE.\nIF YOU THINK ABOUT THIS, WHAT THIS CASE SAID ON THIS TAPE\nCOMPARED TO WHAT HE SAID ABOUT ALICIA MACHADO, WHICH IS\nINEXCUSABLE. THOSE ARE WORDS.\nTHESE ARE ACTIONS. AND THAT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.\n>> DANA BASH, GREAT REPORTING AS ALWAYS, THANK YOU FOR BRINGING\nUS THAT. WE WILL GET A QUICK BREAK ON THE\nOTHER SIDE. YOU WILL HEAR FROM THE MAN THAT\nRAN AGAINST PRESIDENT OBAMA IN 2008, JOHN McCAIN NO LONGER\nSTANDING BY DONALD TRUMP. JOHN McCAIN IN HIS OWN WORDS\nNEXT.",

YOU KNOW, THE TAPE IS JUST NOT\nSOMETHING THAT SQUARES WITH THAT.\nHE HAS THE CHOICE OF EITHER SHREDDING HIS ENTIRE POLITICAL\nIDENTITY. HE'S A POLITICAL PROFESSIONAL\nWHO WANTS A FUTURE IN THIS BUSINESS OR TRYING TO SORT OF\nDEFEND THE INDEFENSIBLE. HE'S CLEARLY LOOKING OUT FOR\nHIMSELF A LITTLE BIT THERE. IT'S THE LAST THING THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN NEEDS AT THIS POINT. FOR SOMEBODY WHO LIKE PENCE TO\nCOME OU AND VOUCH FOR TRUMP IN A FULL-THROATED WAY WOULD MAYBE\nSTART TO RIGHT THE SHIP BUT PENCE IS NOT WILLING DO THAT.\nIT'S IN PART, VICTOR, BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE TAPES OUT THERE.\nTHERE IS MORE STUFF OUT THERE. WE'VE ALREADY HEARD THINGS FROM\nTHE HOWARD STERN SHOW THAT SURFACE HD HOURS AFTER THE\nDAMNING TAPE FROM \"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD.\"\nTHERE ARE OTHERS ON TWITTER SAYING THERE'S A TON MORE OUT\nTHERE FROM THE APPRENTICE AND EVERYWHERE ELSE.\nTHERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF HOT MIKE SITUATIONS.\nTHIS IS WHY CAREER POLITICIANS LIKE MIKE PENCE ARE HEADED FOR\nTHE HILLS. >> THE \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" IS\nREPORTING THAT MIKE PENCE SPOKE WITH A GROUP OF REPUBLICAN\nDONORS SAYING THAT HE IS FULLY COMMITTED TO DONALD TRUMP.\nPENCE'S TEAM SAYING THAT THE CLAIMS THAT HE IS GOING TO BOLT\nFROM THE TICKET, THOSE ARE CATEGORICALLY FALSE.\nIS THAT JUST A LINE TO GET DONALD TRUMP THROUGH THE DEBATE\nOR ARE YOU EXPECTING THAT CONTINUED FULL-THROATED SUPPORT,\nTHAT FULL-THROATED ENDORSEMENT OF DONALD TRUMP AFTER TONIGHT'S\nDEBATE? >> AS A PRACTICAL MATTER, THIS\nNOTION THAT YOU CAN SIMPLY HAVE DONALD TRUMP VANISH AND PUT MIKE\nPENCE IN HIS PLACE, THAT'S NOT REALITY.\nTHERE ARE MANY STATES THAT ARE -- THEY'VE PRINTED AND\nISSUED BALLOTS. THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF VOTES\nALREADY CAST SINCE THE EARLY VOTING AND ABSENTEE VOTING.\nIT'S NOT AS IF YOU CAN RECONVENE THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION.\nSOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES WOULD HAVE TO HAPPEN.\nYOU WOULD HAVE THE SAME 1237 DELEGATES TOGETHER AND HAVE THEM\nALL AGREE. IT'S NOT REALISTIC.\nMIKE PENCE HAS NO CHOICE AT THIS POINT BUT TO RIDE THIS THING\nOUT. I THINK WHAT WE ARE GOING TO SEE\nIS HIM AND OTHER CONSERVATIVES TRYING TO MAYBE EXPLAIN TO TRUMP\nTHAT THERE'S A PROCESS. YOU HAVE TO HUMBLE YOURSELF AND\nASK FOR FORGIVENESS FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND FROM THE\nSPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL HE WAS TALKING ABOUT IN CRUDE AND\nOBSCENE TERMS. THERE'S A PATH BACK.\nIN MIKE PENCE'S STATEMENT, YOU CAN SEE HIM SORT OF SUGGESTING\nWHAT IT IS. HE TALKS ABOUT HIM PRAYING FOR\nTRUMP'S FAMILY.

THAT WAS AN EARLY APPEARANCE\nAFTER REFUSING TO DEFEND DONALD TRUMP IN THE 2005 COMMENTS ABOUT\nWOMEN. NOW, THIS IS A PRETTY STUNNING\nMOVE. PENCE SAID HE WAS OFFENDED BY\nTRUMP'S REMARKS AND DOES NOT CONDONE THEM.\nHE CANCELED HIS APPEARANCE AT A GOP EVENT YESTERDAY IN\nWISCONSIN. DESPITE THIS, HE'S STANDING BY\nDONALD TRUMP. STAYING WITH HIS RUNNING MATE.\nDOZENS OF OTHER REPUBLICANS, THOUGH, THEY ARE NOT.\nTHEY'RE CALLING FOR TRUMP TO DROP OUT OF THE RACE.\nSOME ARE SUGGESTING THAT PENCE TAKE HIS PLACE AT THE TOP OF THE\nTICKET. LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT AND BRING\nINLAHNEE CHEN. FORMER POLICY DIRECTOR.\nALSO JOINED BIP FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE JACK KINGSTON.\nLANEE I'M GOING TO START WITH YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE SITTING NEXT\nTO ME. IS THIS REALISTIC, A POSSIBILITY\nTHAT MIKE PENCE WILL TAKE THE TOP OF THE TICKET HERE?\n>> I DON'T THINK IT IS. I THINK MOST PEOPLE CONCLUDED\nTHAT PEOPLE ARE ALREADY VOTING BY EARLY VOTING.\nDONALD TRUMP WILL BE THE REPUBLICAN ON THE TICKET.\nTHE QUESTION IS, WHAT CAN THE RNC AND THE REPUBLICANS DO PO\nPRESERVE THEIR POSSIBILITY OF HOLDING THE HOUSE AND THE\nSENATE. THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.\nI'M NOT SURE MIKE PENCE IS THE GUY.\nIF THERE WERE A REPLACEMENT, MIKE PENCE DID NOT RUN FOR\nPRESIDENT IN THIS CYCLE. THERE ARE A LOT OF GUYS AND GALS\nWHO DID RUN. THEY OUGHT TO BE LOOKED AT\nFIRST. >> HE DIDN'T EARN A SINGLE\nDELEGATE IN THE PRIMARY. CONGRESSMAN, WHAT IS THE\nRELATIONSHIP -- YOU'RE A SENIOR ADVISER TO THE CAMPAIGN.\nYOU'RE ON THE INSIDE BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE\nRIGHT NOW. WE HEARD AND IT SEEMS LIKE THE\nVICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE WAS DECADES AGO.\nIT WAS REALLY FIVE DAYS AGO NOW. BUT AFTER THE DEBATE THERE WAS\nREPORTING THAT DONALD TRUMP IS NOT HAPPY THAT HIS RUNNING MATE\nDIDN'T DEFEND HIM. NOW WE'RE GETTING A STATEMENT\nFROM THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE THAT HE'S NOT GOING TO\nDEFEND HIM AGAINST THIS. GIVE US AN INSIGHT INTO HOW\nTHEY'RE DOING RIGHT NOW. >> I DON'T KNOW WHERE THOSE\nREPORTS CAME FROM. BECAUSE I HEARD THEM ALSO.\nI CAN SAY THAT THE TWO MEN HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP.\nTHEIR WIVES HAVE GREAT RELATIONSHIPS AND THEIR FAMILIES\nDO AS WELL. NOT ONLY THAT, BUT MIKE PENCE IS\nA LOYAL GUY. HE'S A TEAM PLAYER.\nI THINK I KNOW MIKE VERY, VERY WELL.\nI THINK HE WAS CORRECT IN SAYING HE COULD NOT DEFEND THOSE\nCOMMENTS. HOWEVER, IN TOTALITY OF A CHOICE\nBETWEEN SOMEBODY WHO IS A LONG-TERM BIG GOVERNMENT LIBERAL\nVERSUS SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO CHANGE WASHINGTON, D.C.,\nSOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO CHALLENGE THE CULTURE THERE, THAT MIKE\nPENCE IS ON THE RIGHT TICKET. I THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT WE NEED\nTO SEE OUT OF MIKE AND OUT OF DONALD TRUMP THIS WEEK IS THAT\nPIVOT TO SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, SAID A LOT OF BAD THINGS 10, 11\nYEARS AGO. I'M KNOT THE SAME MAN.\nI CAN TELL YOU THIS PERSONALLY SPEAKING, VICTOR, HE IS NOT THE\nDONALD TRUMP THAT I'VE COME TO KNOW OR HIS FAMILY.\n>> WE'RE NOT SEEING THAT PIVOT, CONGRESSMAN.\nWE'RE NOT SEEING THAT PIVOT. DONALD TRUMP WENT TO TWITTER AND\nRETWEETED JUANITA BRODERICK. HE DIDN'T RETWEET ANYTHING ABOUT\nAN ECONOMIC PLAN, BRINGING JOBS BACK.\nHE RETWEETED JUANITA BRODERICK. >> BUT I THINK YOU WILL SEE ALL\nOF THE ABOVE. I THINK HE WILL HAVE TO START\nTALKING NOT ONLY ABOUT JOBS AND NATIONAL SECURITY AND A LOT\nMORE, BUT I THINK AT THE SAME TIME, HE'S GOT TO BE ON THE\nOFFENSE IN TERMS OF WHO IS HILLARY CLINTON, WHO IS BILL\nCLINTON, WHO ARE THEIR -- THE COLORFUL CHARACTERS IN THEIR\nPAST SUCH AS JUANITA BRODERICK. WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT AND\nRELEVANT? MAYBE ALSO, EASIER TO BUILD A\nCASE ON IS THE 33,000 E-MAILS, BENGHAZI, THE 400,000 DEAD IN\nSYRIA, THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL AND SO I THINK --\n>> CONGRESSMAN -- >> GOT TO HIT ON ALL --\n>> I HEAR YOU WE'VE GOT GOT A COUPLE OF SECONDS LEFT.\nYOU THINK THAT'S THE WRONG WAY TO GO TO BRING UP JUANITA\nBRODERICK. THE RNC HAS MAILINGS ON HOLD\nBECAUSE THEY'VE NOT MADE A DECISION WHICH WAY TO GO.\n>> THEY NEED TO COORDINATE MESSAGE WITH THE CAM PAGE.\nWE NEED TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE DEBATE TONIGHT.\n>> WHAT DO THEY NEED TO HEAR? >> THEY GOT TO FIGURE OUT, ARE\nWE ATTACKING HILLARY CLINTON ON PAST INDISCRETIONS AND OR\nATTACKING THEM ON BENGHAZI AND ON E-MAILS AND SUBSTANCE.\nI THINK THAT'S THE BIG QUESTION. WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS TONIGHT.\n>> LAHNEE, CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU BOTH.\nCHRISTI, BACK TO YOU IN ATLANTA. >> AS WE SIT HERE, HOURS BEFORE\nTHE DEBATE, NO SHORTAGE OF MATERIAL FOR \"SATURDAY NIGHT\nLIVE,\" WAS THERE?

WE'RE SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT\nWHAT ISSUES ARE GOING TO COME UP, INSTEAD WE'RE TALKING ABOUT\nCHAOS IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER\nTRUMP CAN SURVIVE THIS. >> WELL, IT'S TOTAL CHAOS WITHIN\nTHE REPUBLICAN PARTY BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR THERE'S ANYTHING THAT\nCAN BE DONE OTHER THAN WHAT WE SAW YESTERDAY WHICH WAS ONE\nAFTER ANOTHER AFTER ANOTHER REPUBLICAN ELECTED OFFICIALS AND\nLEADERS STEP AWAY FROM DONALD TRUMP AND SAY THEY CAN NO LONGER\nVOTE FOR HIM. THAT MAY BE THE MOST THEY CAN\nDO, BUT IT'S A VERY DELICATE BALANCE THAT THEY'RE WRESTLING\nWITH. I MEAN THE LEGAL ISSUES ARE\nDIFFICULT IN TERMS OF GETTING HIM OFF.\nHE HAS TO STEP ASIDE. THEY CAN'T FORCE HIM OFF.\nEVEN IF THAT WERE TO HAPPEN, THERE ARE BALLOTS THAT HAVE BEEN\nPRINTED, BALLOTS ALREADY BEEN CAST WITH HIS NAME ON THEM.\nTHERE'S NO PRACTICAL WAY TO REALLY SUBSTITUTE SOMEBODY ELSE\nFOR IT.

BUT CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW DONALD\nTRUMP FEELS RIGHT NOW LOOKING AT NEWS REPORTS WHERE OTHER\nREPUBLICANS ARE BEGGING FOR MIKE PENCE INSTEAD OF HIM?\n>> HOW DOES THAT AFFECT HIS MOOD WHEN HE COMES INTO THIS DEBATE.\nTHE FRONT PAGE OF THE ST. LOUIS DISPATCH AS WE DO THIS, HIS LAST\nSTAND, THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION. GET INTO THE POLLING.\nTHIS WAS A BIG DEBATE BEFORE THE TAPES CAME OUT FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING WHY THIS?\nDONALD TRUMP HAS SAID SO MANY CONTROVERSIAL THINGS THROUGHOUT\nTHE CAMPAIGN, WHY IS THIS?

THIS WAS 2005, DOING AN\nINTERVIEW WITH BILLY BUSH OF \"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD.\"\nLISTEN TO A SNIP PET. WE'LL GET TO MORE LATER.\n>> I MOVED ON HER VERY HEAVILY. IN FACT, I TOOK HER OUT\nFURNITURE SHOPPING. SHE WANTED TO GET SOME\nFURNITURE. I'LL SHOW YOU WHERE THERE'S SOME\nNICE FURNITURE. I MOVED ON HER LIKE A BITCH.\nI COULDN'T GET THERE. SHE WAS MARRIED.\nI SEE HER SHE NOW HAS THE BIG PHONY TITS.\nSHE'S TOTALLY CHANGED HER LOOK. >> I SAID WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO\nSAY WAS SOME GRAPHIC LANGUAGE. THAT'S ONE OF THE TAMEST PARTS.\nTHAT'S ONE OF THE TAMEST PARTS OF THIS TAPE HERE.\nAND THE POINT IF YOU GO ON IN THIS TAPE, THAT'S TALKING ABOUT\nMAKING UNWANTED ADVANCES ON A MARRIED WOMAN.\nHE ALSO TALKS ABOUT CONDUCT THAT IS A CRIME.\nIF HE DID IT. PEOPLE GO TO JAIL FOR THE THINGS\nTHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT DOING, GROPING WOMEN.\nTHAT WAS THE DAM OPENING. >> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.\nTHAT'S WHY YOU SAW PARTICULARLY PEOPLE LIKE KELLY AYOTTE AND\nOTHER WOMEN IN CONGRESS COME OUT SO STRONGLY.\nI MEAN, THERE WAS THIS IRONY WHERE PAUL RYAN HAD SIGNED A\nBILL EARLIER IN THE DAY THAT WAS TO PROTECT VICTIMS OF SEXUAL\nASSAULT. AND THEN TWO HOURS LATER THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY IS HAVING TO DEAL WITH THIS.\nI THINK THAT THE FACT THAT IT WASN'T JUST THOSE KINDS OF --\nTHAT LOCKER ROOM TALK THAT WE JUST HEARD A MOMENT AGO, THE\nFACT THAT IT WAS SOMETHING MUCH CLOSER TO WHAT WOULD BE\nCONSIDERED A CRIME IS WHAT MADE IT A DIVIDING LINE FOR SO MANY\nPEOPLE. >> THE FACT THAT IT'S ON TAPE,\nTHE FACT THAT HE IS THERE JOKING ACT IT AS WELL.\nIN MANY WAYS HE ENDS UP TONIGHT WHERE HE BEGAN, IF YOU REMEMBER\nTHAT FIRST DEBATE, SOME OF THE FIRST QUESTIONS FROM MEGAN KELLY\nWERE ABOUT HIS COMMENTS ABOUT WOMEN CALLING THEM PIGS AND\nDOGS. HE SAID IT WAS ONLY ROSIE\nO'DONNELL, BUT NOW HE IS IN A MUCH MORE PRECARIOUS POSITION,\nNOT ONLY HAVE THE POLLS DRIFTED AWAY FROM HIM IN TER OF REAL\nCONSTITUENCIES, EVEN WORKING CLASS WHITE VOTERS, GOING TO\nHILLARY CLINTON. BUT I THINK MAEVE IS RIGHT, IT'S\nTHE SPECTER OF SEXUAL ASSAULT, RIGHT, HIM ESSENTIALLY SAYING\nHIS WEALTH GIVES HIM PERMISSION AND ACCESS.\n>> SAYING HE'S REPEAT LID DONE IT.\n>> HE'S GOT THE TICK TACKS, RIGHT.\n>> IN HIS VIDEO RELEASED SATURDAY NIGHT AFTER TOOK HIS\nAIDES HOURS TO CONVINCE HIM THIS WAS A BIG DEAL, THIS WAS\nIMPORTANT TOO, HE DOESN'T SAY IN THE VIDEO THAT I NEVER DID THIS.\nHE NEVER SAYS HE NEVER DID THIS. I'M GOING TO SAY IT ONE MORE\nTIME, HE'S BRAGGING ABOUT THINGS THAT PEOPLE GO TO JAIL TOO.\nMEN SAY STUPID THINGS IN LOCKER ROOMS.\nMEN DO NOT TALK ABOUT COMMITTING CRIMES IN LOCKER ROOMS OR IF\nANYBODY BRINGS IT UP THE GROWNUP IN THE TEAM TELLS HIM TO SHUT\nUP. >> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE\nREALLY NOTICED IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE WAY THAT MEN AND\nWOMEN ARE RESPONDING TO THIS TAPE.\nWHEN I SAW IT, I THOUGHT THIS CONFIRMS A LOT OF MY WORST\nSUSPICIONS. IT'S REALLY FULL OF SALTY\nLANGUAGE. WHEN I'VE SPOKE ON THE THE WOMEN\nWHO I WORK WITH AND THE WOMEN IN MY LIFE ABOUT THIS, THERE'S A\nREAL SENSE OF DISGUST. IT DOESN'T JUST TO DO WITH THE\nFACT THAT THIS WAS A CRIME, THERE'S A SENSE OF DEPRESSION\nTHAT AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT IN THE COUNTRY'S HISTORY THAT WE'RE\nSTILL HAVING THIS KIND OF NONSENSE HAPPEN.\n>> HE SAYS -- >> THE IRONY OF THIS.\nI MEAN, WE WERE IN A YEAR IN WHICH THERE WAS SO MUCH\nATTENTION FOCUSSED ON THE FACT THAT HILLARY CLINTON WAS THE\nFIRST FEMALE, YOU KNOW, NOMINEE AND WE ARE -- HAVE HAD SOME OF\nTHE MOST CRASS LANGUAGE ABOUT WOMEN BECOME PART OF THE\nPOLITICAL DISCOURSE IN HISTORY. >> HE'S BRINGING THE GENDER CARD\nINTO THIS IN A WAY THAT SHE ISN'T.\n>> BUT I ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT THIS IN\nTHE CONTEXT OF WHERE WE ARE IN THIS COUNTRY.\nI MEAN, TEN YEARS AGO THE REACTION TO THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN\nLESS SEVERE FOR DONALD TRUMP. THE SENSITIVITY TO THIS ISSUE IS\nMUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT AND IMPORTANT AND I THINK THAT TELLS\nUS THERE'S BEEN AN IMPORTANT AND SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE MOVEMENT IN\nTHE COUNTRY TOWARD A RECOGNITION THAT THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE\nBEHAVIOR. AND I THINK THAT THE REVULSION\nTHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PARTICULARLY AMONG WOMEN BUT\nAMONG MEN ALSO TELLS US THAT WE ARE IN A DIFFERENT PLACE.\n>> MUCH, MUCH MORE TO TALK ABOUT ON THIS ISSUE INCLUDING HOW\nDONALD TRUMP HANDLES IT BEHIND ME HERE WHEN HE'S ON THIS STAGE\nHOURS FROM NOW. THE RACE WAS TRENDING CLINTON'S\nWAYS BEFORE THIS TRUMP BOMB SHELL.\nWE MAP OUT THE DEBATE STAKES",

WHILE THE REST OF US WANDERED\nAROUND TAKING VARIOUS KINDS OF CLASSES, SHE WAS FOCUSED ON\nWOMEN AND CHILDREN, CHILDREN'S WELFARE FROM THE FIRST.\nSHE NEVER DEVIATED FROM THAT AT ALL, EVER.\n>> PERHAPS THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD BREAK HILLARY'S FOCUS\nDURING HER TIME AT YALE WAS THE ADORING GAZE OF ONE PROMISING\nYOUNG LAW STUDENT, A SCRAPPING, SMOOTH-TALKING SCHOLAR FROM THE\nGREAT STATE OF ARKANSAS. >> HE WAS TALL, 6'2\" AND THIS\nHUGE HEAD OF SORT OF FRIZZY, REDDISH HAIR.\nAND HE HAD AN ACCENT. >> DID HE MAKE HIS POLITICAL\nAMBITIONS KNOWN? >> ABSOLUTELY.\nWHEN I FIRST MET HIM, I REMEMBER HE'D BEEN AT LAW SCHOOL MAYBE\nTWO OR THREE DAYS AND WE WENT THROUGH THE LINE IN THE\nLUNCHROOM AND HE KNEW THE NAMES OF EVERYONE IN THE LUNCHROOM.\nHE KNEW ALL THE SERVERS, CALLED THEM BY NAME.\n>> BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL THE SPRING OF 1971 IN THE YALE\nLIBRARY THAT BILL CLINTON WOULD LEARN THE NAME OF THE YOUNG\nWOMAN WHO WOULD CHANGE EVERYTHING.\nYEARS LATER HILLARY RECOUNTED THE EXACT MOMENT.\n>> I PUT MY BOOKS DOWN AND SAID IF YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP LOOKING\nAT ME AND I'M GOING TO KEEP LOOKING AT YOU, WE OUGHT TO AT\nLEAST KNOW EACH OTHER'S NAMES.

HE WANTED TO GO INTO POLITICS.\nI THOUGHT BEFORE I GET MARRIED I SHOULD KNOW WHAT I WANT TO DO.\nSO I SAID NO THAT FIRST TIME. HE CAME BACK AND ASKED ME AGAIN.\nI SAID, NO, I'M STILL NOT READY. >> SO INSTEAD OF TIEING THE KNOT\nAND MOVING TO ARKANSAS WHERE BILL WAS FORGING HIS POLITICAL\nCAREER, HILLARY FOLLOWED HER PASSION TO MASSACHUSETTS AND\nWENT TO WORK FOR HER MENTOR, MARION WRIGHT EDDELMAN AT THE\nCHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND. >> MY WORK AT THE CHILDREN'S\nDEFENSE FUND SHOWED ME HOW MUCH WE NEEDED TO DO TO HELP ABUSED\nAND NEGLECTED KID, KIDS WITH LOUSY SCHOOLS, IN ADULT JAILS,\nALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS.\nI WAS FIXATED ON WHAT WE COULD DO AS ADVOCATES TO MAKE CHANGES.\n>> EVERYTHING SHE DID SHE DID VERY WELL.\nI TRUSTED HER TO SEND HER OUT TO DO ANY BIT OF RESEARCH, WHETHER\nIT WAS BASIC RESEARCH OR TO GO INTO THE FIELD.\nHILLARY WAS ALWAYS A STAR. >> BUT SOON, ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY\nEMERGED THAT GAVE HILLARY A FRONT ROW SEAT TO HISTORY.\n>> WHAT DID THE PRESIDENT KNOW AND WHEN DID HE KNOW IT?\n>> IN 1974, HILLARY MOVED TO WASHINGTON, D.C.

HE WAS CHARMING.\nHE WAS ARTICULATE. HE WAS DOWN HOME.\nHE WAS HIMSELF. HE WAS AMAZING.\n>> CLINTON ASKED HIS FRIEND TO MAKE SURE HILLARY FELT RIGHT AT\nHOME. >> AND RIGHT BEFORE SHE CAME, HE\nDID CALL ME AND SAID DON'T FORGET, SHE'S COMING, SHE'S\nCOMING. I WANT YOU TO CALL HER.\nI SAID, OKAY, OKAY, I WILL. I WILL.\nI DID CALL HER THE SECOND DAY SHE WAS AT THE LAW SCHOOL AND\nTHAT'S WHEN I MET HER. >> HILLARY ACCEPTED A POSITION\nTO TEACH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS LAW SCHOOL.\nAND TO EXPAND THE SCHOOL'S LEGAL AID CLINIC.\nBUT WHILE HILLARY WAS STARTING HER NEW CAREER, BILL WAS BUSY\nRUNNING HIS FIRST CAMPAIGN. >> I HAD NEVER KNOWN ANYBODY IN\nPOLITICS BEFORE. SO I WAS A LITTLE BIT HESITANT\nTO BE THRUST INTO THAT BUT IT WAS HIS DREAM.\nI WANTED TO SUPPORT HIM BUT I ALSO WANTED TO BE SURE THAT I\nWAS CONTINUING MY WORK AS WELL. >> I MEAN, SHE WAS SO SMART AND\nSHE WAS SO GOOD. >> JIM BLAIR AND HIS GIRL\nFRIEND, DIANE, BONDED WITH HILLARY ALMOST IMMEDIATELY.\n>> YOU WOULD BE VERY SURPRISED TO KNOW THAT AN AWFUL LOT OF\nTIMES POLITICS WAS DISCUSSED. THEY LOVED TALKING POLITICS.\n>> BUT IN THE FALL OF 1974, THE ONLY POLITICS THEY WERE TALKING\nWAS BILL CLINTON'S RUN FOR CONGRESS.\n\u00e2\u0099\u00aa THERE'S A FELLA HERE THAT'S BEEN TALKING SOME ABOUT RUNNING\nFOR CONGRESSMAN \u00e2\u0099\u00aa >> THOUGH BILL CLINTON LOST THAT\nRACE, A YEAR LATER HE WOULD TAKE ONE LAST SHOT AT SOMETHING ELSE\nHE HAD BEEN FIGHTING FOR. >> SHE SAID BILL ASKED ME TO\nMARRY HIM AGAIN.

WITH NO PRIOR BUSINESS EXPERIENCE, HAS A LOT TO ANSWER FOR IN HIS RUNNING OF A FAILED $300 MILLION COMPANY. >> YOU LIKE TO THINK THAT IF SOMEONE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN THAT BIG A COMPANY, THEY SURROUND THEMSELVES WITH PROFESSIONALS WHO DO. THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN HERE. SHOLOM RUBASHKIN TOOK IT UPON HIMSELF AND MADE SOME VERY POOR AND SOME ILLEGAL DECISIONS. >> Narrator: IN SEPTEMBER, THE IOWA ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE CHARGES SHOLOM RUBASHKIN AND COMPANY OWNER, AARON RUBASHKIN, WITH 9,311 LABOR VIOLATIONS INVOLVING 29 CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 18. >> WE DIDN'T ALLEGE THAT HE PERSONALLY HIRED ANY OF THESE PEOPLE. HE SUPERVISED THE H.R. DEPARTMENT, AND WE FELT THAT THE EVIDENCE WOULD SUPPORT A CLEAR INFERENCE THAT HE DIRECTED THE HIRING PRACTICES THAT OCCURRED IN THE H.R. DEPARTMENT. >> Narrator: UNDER IOWA CODE, THE VIOLATIONS ARE CONSIDERED MISDEMEANORS. >> THE PENALTIES ARE CUMULATIVE ON TOP OF EACH OTHER SO THAT IF SHOLOM HAD BEEN CONVICTED OF ALL 9,311 COUNTS, HE WOULD HAVE FACED OVER 760 YEARS IN PRISON. >> Narrator: WEEKS LATER,\nSHOLOM RUBASHKIN IS ARRESTED AND\nCHARGED IN FEDERAL COURT WITH CONSPIRACY TO HARBOR\nUNDOCUMENTED ALIENS AND DOCUMENT\nFRAUD, AS WELL AS OVERSEEING A $26 MILLION BANK FRAUD.\nALL TOLD, HE'S CHARGED WITH 161\nSEPARATE FEDERAL CRIMINAL COUNTS, INCLUDING POCKETING\nNEARLY $1.5 MILLION.\nAMONG THE GOVERNMENT'S ALLEGATIONS -- $300,000 FOR\nCREDIT-CARD BILLS, $200,000 FOR\nREMODELING, $76,000 FOR HIS STATE AND FEDERAL INCOME TAX,\nAND EVEN MORE FOR JEWELRY,\nMORTGAGES, INSURANCE, AND CAR PAYMENTS.\n>> WHAT WAS THE REAL, TRUE,\nPURPOSE OF THE MONEY? PROSECUTORS ARE SAYING HE WAS\nUSING IT FOR, YOU KNOW, HIS OWN\nPERSONAL EXPENSES. WHAT THE DEFENSE LAWYERS\nCOUNTERED WAS, \"OKAY, YEAH,\nSOMETIMES THAT MONEY WAS BORROWED, BUT THE MONEY WAS USED\nFOR BUSINESS EXPENSES THAT\nHAPPENED TO LOOK PERSONAL.\" >> Narrator: SHOLOM RUBASHKIN IS\nCONVICTED ON NOVEMBER 12, 2009,\nOF 86 COUNTS OF BANK FRAUD FOR HIS MISHANDLING OF THE FIRST\nBANK BUSINESS CAPITAL LOAN.\n>> PROSECUTORS ASSERTED, AND THE JUDGE AGREED, THAT HE WAS VERY\nMUCH IN CONTROL, THAT HE\nACTUALLY WAS THE MASTERMIND OF THE WHOLE THING, AND HE WAS\nRUNNING THE ENTIRE CORRUPT\nOPERATION. >> Narrator: SATISFIED,\nPROSECUTORS DECLINED TO PURSUE\nTHE 72 FEDERAL COUNTS OF LABOR VIOLATIONS. >> THEY DROPPED THE IMMIGRATION-RELATED CHARGES WITH THE PROVISION THAT WE CAN BRING THEM AGAIN IF WE NEED TO, MEANING IF SOMEHOW HIS OTHER CONVICTION WOULD BE OVERTURNED OR NEW EVIDENCE SURFACED THAT LED THEM TO WANT TO PROSECUTE IT FURTHER FOR OTHER REASONS. >> Narrator: BUT ADVOCATES FOR THE WORKERS ARE BITTERLY DISAPPOINTED. >> THE MESSAGE TO EMPLOYERS AGAIN IS \"DON'T MESS WITH THE BANK. DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO THE WORKERS.\" >> Narrator: MEANWHILE, STATE CHILD-LABOR VIOLATIONS, AND NOW SHOLOM RUBASHKIN HIMSELF FACES SIMILAR CHARGES. >> WHAT OUR EVIDENCE SHOWED WAS THAT SHOLOM RUBASHKIN HAD THE INFORMATION THAT KIDS WERE WORKING IN THE PLANT AND HE HAD THE AUTHORITY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. >> THE DEFENSE COUNTERED THAT THE CHILDREN WHO HAD APPLIED HAD MISLED THE MANAGERS. AND SO, AS A RESULT, YOU KNOW, THE MANAGERS COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN. >> Narrator: IN JUNE 2010, AN IOWA JURY ACQUITS SHOLOM RUBASHKIN ON ALL COUNTS OF CHILD-LABOR VIOLATIONS. >> HE WAS COMPLETELY EXONERATED OF EVERYTHING THAT HE WAS CHARGED WITH IN STATE COURT. >> Narrator: BUT HE IS STILL GUILTY OF THE FEDERAL CHARGES. ON JUNE 22, 2010, SHOLOM RUBASHKIN IS SENTENCED TO 27 YEARS IN PRISON FOR HIS ROLE FRAUD. HE'S ALSO ORDERED TO PAY $27 MILLION IN RESTITUTION. BARRING APPEALS, RUBASHKIN WILL BE 75 YEARS OLD WHEN HE'S RELEASED IN 2033. >> NO REASONABLE PERSON LOOKING AT THIS CASE WOULD CONCLUDE THAT A MAN WHO BORROWED MORE MONEY THAN HIS FATHER'S BUSINESS WAS ENTITLED TO BORROW SHOULD RECEIVE A LIFE SENTENCE. >> MOST OF THE MURDERERS THAT I PROSECUTED GOT LESS TIME IN PRISON THAN SHOLOM RUBASHKIN IS SENTENCED TO RIGHT NOW. >> Narrator: 80-YEAR-OLD OWNER AND SOLE SHAREHOLDER, IS NOT CONVICTED OF ANY CRIMES. SHOLOM RUBASHKIN SERVES HIS TIME IN OTISVILLE, NEW YORK. AWAITING APPEALS, HE LEAVES A LEGACY AS TANGLED AND CONFUSING AS THE COMPANY HE ONCE RAN. >> DID SHOLOM RUBASHKIN MAKE MISTAKES? YOU BET HE DID. WAS HE IN OVER HIS HEAD? YES, HE WAS. DID HE EVER INTEND TO ROB, STEAL, OR CHEAT ANYONE? NO. >> IT WAS UNNECESSARY. IT DIDN'T HAVE TO HAPPEN. IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS AVOIDABLE. HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE -- YOU CANNOT AFFORD NOT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR COMPANY, TOP TO BOTTOM. YOU'RE THE C.E.O.",
