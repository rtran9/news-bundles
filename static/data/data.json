IT IS THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 15th.\nI'M BETTY NGUYEN ALONGSIDE ALEX WITT.\nHILLARY CLINTON IS SET TO RETURN TO CAMPAIGNING TODAY WITH EVENTS\nIN NORTH CAROLINA AND THE CAPITAL, WASHINGTON, D.C.\nSHE SPENT THREE DAYS OFF THE ROAD, RECUPERATING AT HOME IN\nCHAPPAQUA FROM PNEUMONIA. HER DOCTOR RELEASED MORE DETAILS\nON HER MEDICAL HISTORY, INCLUDING SHE TAKES A COMMON\nBLOOD THINNER AFTER THAT CONCUSSION THREE YEARS AGO\nRESULTED IN A BLOOD CLOT. THE REPORT MENTIONED A TUBE PUT\nIN HER EAR OF JANUARY THIS YEAR AFTER A SINUS AND EAR INFECTION.\nHER PHYSICIAN OTHERWISE SAYS SHE'S HEALTHY AND FIT TO SERVE\nAS PRESIDENT AND THAT, QUOTE, SHE IS IN EXCELLENT MENTAL\nCONDITION. FOR DAYS, DONALD TRUMP STAYED\nAWAY FROM QUESTIONS ABOUT CLINTON'S HEALTH, BUT LAST NIGHT\nHE BROUGHT UP THE QUESTION OF HER FITNESS ONCE MORE.\n>> I REALLY HAVE NO VIEW. I JUST HOPE SHE GETS BETTER AND\nCAN GET BACK OUT. I HAVE NO VIEW.\nYOU KNOW, I JUST DON'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED WITH IT.\nI HOPE SHE'S GOING TO BE FINE AND CONTINUE ONWARD.\n>> IN ALL FAIRNESS, SHE'S LYING IN BED GETTING BETTER, AND HE\nWANT HER BACK ON THE TRAIL, RIGHT.\nIT IS HOT, AND IT'S ALWAYS HOT WHEN I PERFORM BECAUSE THE\nCROWDS ARE SO BIG. THESE ROOMS WERE NOT DESIGNED\nFOR THIS KIND OF A CROWD. I DON'T KNOW, FOLKS.\nYOU THINK HILLARY WOULD BE ABLE TO STAND UP HERE FOR AN HOUR AND\nDO THIS? I DON'T KNOW.\nI DON'T THINK SO. I DON'T THINK SO.\n>> DONALD TRUMP ALSO REVEALED MORE ABOUT HIS OWN HEALTH IN A\nTAPING WITH DR. OZ SET TO AIR TODAY.\n>> IF YOUR HEALTH IS AS STRONG AS IT SEEMS FROM YOUR REVIEW OF\nSYSTEMS, WHY NOT SHARE YOUR MEDICAL RECORDS?\n>> WELL, I REALLY HAVE NO PROBLEM IN DOING IT.\nI HAVE IT RIGHT HERE. I MEAN, SHOULD I DO IT?\nI DON'T CARE. SHOULD I DO IT?\n[ APPLAUSE ] IT'S TWO LETTERS.\nONE IS THE REPORT AND THE OTHER IS FROM LENNOX HILL HOSPITAL.\n>> MAY I SEE THEM? >> YEAH, SURE.\nTHOSE WERE ALL THE TESTS JUST DONE LAST WEEK.\n>> IF ELECTED AT AGE 70, YOU'LL BE THE OLDEST PERSON TO EVER\nENTER THE OVAL OFFICE.

THAT WAS AUGUST 24th.\nKELLYANNE CONWAY WAS TELLING ME, YES, PERHAPS, DONALD TRUMP\nSHOULD RELEASE MORE COMPLETE MEDICAL INFORMATION.\nTHAT WAS AUGUST 24th. TWO DAYS LATER, AUGUST 26th, NBC\nNEWS SCORED AN INTERVIEW WITH THAT DOCTOR WHO HAD RELEASED A\nLETTER. IN THAT INTERVIEW, DONALD\nTRUMP'S GASTROINTEROLOGIST SAID THAT HE WROTE THAT LETTER IN\nABOUT FIVE MINUTES WHILE A DONALD TRUMP STAFFER STOOD\nOUTSIDE AND WAITED FOR IT. HE SAID SOME OF THE MORE OVER\nTHE TOP STATEMENTS IN THAT LETTER, THE ASTONISHINGLY\nHEALTHY LAB RESULTS, THAT WAS MEANT AS A JOKE.\nTWO DAYS AFTER THAT, DONALD TRUMP TWEETED THAT HE AGREED, HE\nSHOULD RELEASE MORE DETAILED MEDICAL RECORDS.\nAND THEN A WEEK LATER, DONALD TRUMP TOLD ABC NEWS THAT HE\nWOULD RELEASE FURTHER INFORMATION ON HIS HEALTH\nWHETHER OR NOT HILLARY DID AS WELL.\n>> DO YOU THINK HILLARY CLINTON DESERVES TO HEAR MORE ABOUT YOU.\n>> I WOULD LOVE TO GIVE SPECIFICS, AS FAR AS I'M\nCONCERNED AND IF SHE WANTS TO GO FIRST --\n>> WHY DON'T YOU GO FIRST? >> NOW THAT YOU ASK, I THESE I\nWILL DO THAT. >> NOW THAT YOU ASK -- BY THE\nEND OF THAT WEEK, WHICH IS LAST WEEK, WE GOT THIS ANNOUNCEMENT\nFROM THIS DAYTIME TV SHOW, THE DR. OZ SHOW ANNOUNCING THAT\nDONALD TRUMP WOULD BE APPEARING ON THAT DAYTIME TV SHOW WITH\nTHAT TV DOCTOR TO TALK ABOUT MR. DONALD TRUMP'S HEALTH.\nYESTERDAY THE HOST OF THAT DAYTIME TALK SHOW DR. OZ WENT ON\nFOX NEWS RADIO AND SAID TRUMP WOULD BE ACTUALLY HANDING OVER\nHIS MEDICAL RECORDS TO DR. OZ, TO THE HOST OF THAT TV SHOW LIVE\nON TV. THE MEDICAL RECORDS WOULD BE\nREVEALED ON TV. THEN INTERESTINGLY THIS MORNING\nTHAT WAS OFF. TRUMP TELLING REPORTERS THEY HAD\nBASICALLY CHANGED THEIR MIND, THEY WOULD NOT BE HANDING OVER\nTHEIR MEDICAL RECORDS OVER ON YOUR TV SHOW.\n>> JOHN ROBERTS JUST REPORTED A LITTLE WHILE AGO THAT HE'S GOING\nTO GO ON DR. OZ TODAY, BUT THAT HE IS NOT GOING TO RELEASE THE\nRESULTS OF HIS PHYSICAL, WHY IS THAT?\n>> ON A TV SHOW? I DON'T THINK THAT --\n>> THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL PLAN, WASN'T IT?\n>> UH, NO. >> UH, YES.\n>> THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN FOLLOWED THAT UP TODAY, THAT APPEARANCE\nBY THE CAMPAIGN MANAGER THIS MORNING ON FOX, NO, THAT WAS\nNEVER THE PLAN, WE WERE NEVER GOING TO DO THAT, FOLLOWING UP\nBY INSISTING TO REPORTERS THAT IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS THAT TRUMP\nWAS NOT GOING TO RELEASE HIS MEDICAL RECORDS OR THE RESULTS\nOF HIS LAB TESTS ON THAT TV SHOW, NEVER.\nAND TODAY WENT ON THAT TV TALK SHOW, AND SURPRISE, WITH A\nFLOURISH, HE HANDED OVER WHAT HE SAID WERE HIS MEDICAL RECORDS,\nOR AT LEAST THE DESCRIPTION OF HOW HE DID AT HIS RECENT\nPHYSICAL. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE.\nNO REPORTERS WERE AT IT THE TAPING, NOTHING HAS BEEN\nRELEASED PUBLICLY, WE'RE TOLD THAT WHAT HE HANDED OVER ON TV\nWAS A ONE PAGES MEDICAL SUMMARY FROM OUR OLD FRIEND DR.\nBORNSTEIN. I'M NOT SURE IF THERE ARE JOKES\nIN THIS ONE TOO. WE CAN REPORT THAT THE HOST OF\nTHE TV SHOW, DR. OZ HAD NEVER SEEN THAT DOCUMENT, WHAT WAS IT\nWAS BEFORE DONALD TRUMP HANDED IT TO HIM.\nSO IT'S NOT LIKE HE DID A LOT OF READING ABOUT WHAT HE HAD FOUND.\nIN THEIR VIEW THE WHOLE SPECTACLE DONALD TRUMP HAS\nCREATED ARRANGE THIS WHOLE ISSUE IS IN THAT WORDS RIDICULOUS.\nACCORDING TO THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN, DONALD TRUMP IS,\nQUOTE, MAKING A MOCKERY OF THIS. AND SO, ULTIMATELY, BOTTOM LINE,\nWE HAVE STILL GOT NOTHING. AND MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T CARE.\nBUT THE DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN REMAINS THE ONLY PRESIDENTIAL\nCAMPAIGN IN U.S. HISTORY TO HAVE MADE SUCH A HASH AND SUCH A\nBIZARRE SPECTACLE OUT OF WHAT IS USUALLY A TOTALLY RUN OF THE\nMILL PART OF THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.\nAND THERE'S ALL THESE SERIOUS CONCERNS SWIRLING AROUND THE\nTRUMP FOUNDATION AND HOW TRUTHFUL TRUMP AND HIS CAMPAIGN\nHAVE BEEN ABOUT THAT FOUNDATION AND WHOSE MONEY THAT FOUNDATION\nIS GIVING AWAY ANYWAY. AND WITH THIS NEW DAMMING\nDOCUMENT SITUATION, UNLESS HE DRASTICALLY SERVED HIMSELF FROM\nHIS LIFE EELS WORK AND HIS BUSINESS INTERESTS, TODAY\nBASICALLY GETTING THE HOOK AND GETTING YANKED OFF STAGE IN\nFLINT, MICHIGAN TONIGHT BY THAT PASTOR, IF YOU'RE GOOD AT BEING\nA SHOWMAN, YOU CAN DISTRACT FROM ALL THAT, BY SHOWING A SHOWMAN'S\nSERVICE. A REAL SHOWMAN CAN -- THERE'S\nBEEN NO RELEASE OF INFORMATION ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S HEALTH.\nNOBODY OTHER THAN THAT GUY ON TV HAS SEEN ANYTHING NEW ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP'S HEALTH TODAY, EVEN THOUGH A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE\nCONVINCED THEMSELVES THAT HE'S MADE SOME NEW DISCLOSURE ABOUT\nHIS HEALTH. A GREAT SHOWMAN CAN PICK ANY ONE\nTHING AND BE SO RIDICULOUS ABOUT IT THAT EVERYBODY STOPS WHATEVER\nTHEY WERE PAYING ATTENTION TO BEFORE AND PAYS ATTENTION TO\nTHAT RIDICULOUS CIRCUS INSTEAD, AND NOT ONLY DO WE PAY FOR THE\nPRIVILEGE OF PAYING ATTENTION TO IT.\nTHAT'S WHAT SHOWMANSHIP IS, IT'S A CON, BUT IT'S VERY COMPELLING.\nTHIS IS A WEIRD DAY IN THE NEWS, BUT A LOT OF WHAT HAPPENED IN\nTODAY'S NEWS MAKE ME FEEL LIKE I NEED TO WASH.\nWE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. >> WHY NOT SHARE YOUR MEDICAL\nRECORDS? WHY NOT --\n>> I HAVE NO REAL PROBLEM IN DOING IT.\nI HAVE IT RIGHT HERE? SHOULD I DO IT?\nI DON'T CARE. >>> IF ELECTED AT AGE 70, YOU\nWILL BE THE OLDEST PERSON TO EVER ENTER THE OVAL OFFICE.\n>> JUST ABOUT THE SAME AGE AS RONALD REAGAN AND HILLARY'S A\nYEAR BEHIND ME. JUST BASED ON THIS STAGE OF MY\nLIFE. I FEEL AS GOOD TODAY AS I DID\nWHEN I WAS 30. >> OH, WELL, THAT'S TOTALLY\nRESOLVED THEN, DONE AND DUSTED, HOW DO YOU FEEL?\nI FEEL GREAT. REALLY HOW GREAT DO YOU FEEL?\nDONALD TRUMP APPEARING ON A DAYTIME TV SHOW, EARLIER TAPED\nTODAY, IT'S DUE TO AIR TOMORROW. DURING THAT TAPING MR. DONALD\nTRUMP HANDED OVER WHAT HE SAID WERE SOME KIND OF MEDICAL RECORD\nPREPARED BY HIS DOCTOR WHO HE SAYS GAVE HIM A PHYSICAL EXAM\nLAST WEEK. JOINING US NOW IS OUR MEDICAL\nNEWS CONTRIBUTOR.

OZ HIMSELF SAW TODAY. WHAT I STILL DIDN'T HEAR IS A\nLIST OF MEDICAL PROBLEMS. IT'S JUST -- WE LIKE TO BE\nSYSTEMATIC ABOUT THESE THINGS, WHAT WE KNOW ARE THE MEDICINES\nTHAT HE TAKES, AND FROM THAT YOU CAN INFER WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS\nHE HAS. BUT I THINK WHAT WAS IN THE\nLETTER TODAY WERE SOME RESULTS OF PREVIOUS EKGs, CHEST X RAY,\nCOLONOSCOPY, LABS FROM LAST WEEK, WHICH WERE REPORTEDLY\nNORMAL. HE WAS EXAMINED LAST WEEK AND\nACCORDING TO THE IMPRESSION FROM DR. OZ, THERE WAS NOTHING\nUNTOWARD ABOUT HIS PHYSICAL EXAM.\nWE DID HEAR ABOUT HIS WEIGHT AND",

THERE IS POLITICS AND HEALTH.\nLET ME START WITH YOU, SANJAY, ABOUT HER HEALTH.\nTWO-PAGE LETTER THAT HILLARY CLINTON'S DOCTOR RELEASED.\nFILLED WITH LAB RESULTS AND THE VITAMINS SHE'S ON AND WHAT SHE'S\nNOT DEFICIENT IN. WHAT DID YOU SEE IN READING THIS\nLETTER? >> FIRST OF ALL, IT'S A LETTER.\nIT'S NOT MEDICAL RECORDS. ALL THIS TALK WHETHER MEDICAL\nRECORDS ARE GOING TO BE RELEASED.\nNEITHER ONE HAD MEDICAL RECORDS RELEASED.\nTHE BIGGER THING WAS A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT HAPPENED TO\nTHE RECENT HEALTH EPISODE. THE PNEUMONIA.\nSHE GOT A C.A.T. SCAN TO DIAGNOSE THAT AND PUT ON\nANTIBIOTICS. TEN DAYS OF AN ANTIBIOTIC KNOWN\nAS LEVIQUIN. THROUGHOUT THE YEAR SHE HAD\nSEVERAL SCANS. CT SCAN OF HER SINUSES AND BRAIN\nAND CT SCAN OF HER LUNGS. >> BECAUSE SHE HAS SEASONAL\nALLERGIES AND SISINUSITIS. SOMETIMES YOU'LL DO THAT AND THE\nBRAIN SHOWED NO ABNORMALITIES WHICH IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE GOING\nBACK TO 2012 THERE WAS ALL THESE QUESTIONS WAS THERE SOME SORT OF\nINJURY TO THE BRAIN. THE CT HAS REPORTED NO EVIDENCE\nOF ABNORMALITIES. >> YOU'RE SATISFIED WITH THIS\nLETTER? >> WE'RE READING A SUMMARY OF\nSOMEONE'S INTERPRETATION OF ALL THE MEDICAL RECORDS.\n>> WHAT DO WE USUALLY GET? WHAT ARE WE COMPARING THIS TO AS\nA STANDARD? >> THIS IS TYPICALLY WHAT WE\nGET. IN 2008 JOHN McCAIN RELEASED HIS\nMEDICAL RECORDS ABOUT 1,000 PAGES AND I GOT A CHANCE TO LOOK\nAT THOSE, BUT, TYPICALLY, IT'S A LETTER LIKE THIS AND SOME TYPE\nOF SUMMARY BY A PHYSICIAN WHO HAS BEEN TREATING THE PERSON FOR\nA LONG TIME. >> HOW IS THIS PLAYING\nPOLITICALLY IN TERMS OF WHO LOOKS KN IN THIS AND WHO\nDOESN'T? >> SORT OF HARD TO SAY.\nI LIKE TO LOOK AT THE POLL NUMBERS AND THERE REALLY ISN'T\nPOLLING ON THIS YET. HOW MUCH INFORMATION WE EXPECT\nFROM OUR CANDIDATES. ONE THING THAT WE'RE SEEING OR\nBEING REINFORCED HERE IS A PARTISAN INTERPRETATION TO THAT.\nPEOPLE WHO LIKE DONALD TRUMP THINK HE HAS GIVEN ENOUGH\nINFORMATION ON HIS TAXES AND ENOUGH INFORMATION IN GENERAL\nAND PEOPLE FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHE QUESTION THAT IS REALLY INTERESTING UNDERCUTTING ALL\nTHIS IS WHAT IS THE STANDARD? SHOULD WE GIVE THOUSANDS OF\nPAGES OR IS A LETTER OF A SUMMARY ENOUGH?\nWHETHER SUCH A LETTER IS ENOUGH, PARTICULARLY WHEN THERE IS AN\nACUTE INCIDENT THAT HAPPENS. BUT, I THINK THAT MOSTLY VOTERS\nARE GOING TO LOOK AT THIS THROUGH THE LENS AT WHICH THEY\nLOOK AT THE CANDIDATES, EITHER POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY.\n>> HILLARY HAS THIS DOCTOR WHO, BY ALL ACCOUNTS, IS A REAL\nDOCTOR. TRUMP GOES ON DR. OZ AND, ONCE\nAGAIN, USES HIS DR. BORSTEIN. HE IS CONTROVERSIAL BY ANY\nMEASURE AND HE WROTE A LETTER THAT WAS RIDICULOUS THE FIRST\nTIME PUTTING OUT HIS FINDINGS. SO, THEY DID IT IN DIFFERENT\nWAYS. DOES ANY OF THAT MATTER?\n>> HONESTLY, I DON'T REALLY THINK SO.\nIF YOU ASK SOMEONE WHO IS A FERVENT TRUMP SUPPORTER HOW THEY\nFEEL ABOUT THE LETTER, THEY WOULD DISAGREE WITH YOUR\nASSESSMENT. A LOT OF OPRAISES IN THERE.\n>> THAT ENDS THE ANALYSIS OF THE LETTER.\nDOCTORS DON'T WRITE HYPERBOLIC LETTERS THAT ARE FILLED WITH\nCRAZY ASSESSMENTS OF WHAT SOMEBODY'S SUPREME HEALTH IS.\n>> SURE. >> DOESN'T MATTER HOW YOU FEEL\nABOUT IT. THAT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT DR.\nSANJAY GUPTA DOES IN A REAL LETTER ABOUT ANYTHING.\nAM I WRONG ABOUT THIS? >> LACKED IN OBJECTIVE DATA, AS\nWELL. IT DIDN'T HAVE SOME SIMPLE\nOBJECTIVE DATA THAT YOU WOULD LOOK AT FOR SOMEONE'S RISK OF\nHEART DISEASE AND DIFFERENT THINGS.\n>> DR. TRUMP'S HEALTH AND IT WAS NOT A REAL DISCLOSURE OF HIS\nMEDICAL RECORDS. HE HAD IN HIS POCKET ONE-PAGE\nLETTER THAT HE REVEALED ON DR. OZ AND DR. OZ GOT TO TAKE A LOOK\nAT. SO, DOES THAT POLITICALLY ANSWER\nANY LINGERING QUESTIONS? >> NO.\nLOOK, PHILIP IS RIGHT. WHAT A MADE FOR TV MOMENT WHEN\nHE SITS DOWN AND TELLS DR. OZ, WE'RE NOT GOING TO DISCUSS\nSPECIFICS OR SPECIFICS ABOUT IT AND SITS DOWN AND PULLS OUT THE\nPIECE -- LOOK WHAT I HAVE IN MY HAND HERE.\n>> IT'S GOOD TV. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT POLITICS.\nTHE POLITICS OF IT, THOUGH, HE IS TRYING TO REACH A\nCONSTITUENCY THAT HE'S NOT DOING GREAT WITH NOW.\nTHAT IS WOMEN. HE'S DOING WELL WITH MARRIED\nWOMEN, BUT NOT DOING WELL WITH SINGLE WOMEN.\nSO, WHEN HE GOES ON DR. OZ, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A\nCONSTITUENCY OF VIEWERSHIP THAT IS LARGELY COMPRISED OF WOMEN.\nTHAT'S WHY HE DID THAT. AND, GUESS WHAT, WE'RE GOING TO\nBE TALKING ABOUT IT ALL DAY TODAY, AS WELL.\nTO HIS POINT, HE THINKS THAT HE IS NOT ONLY HITTING THAT\nCONSTITUENCY, BUT HITTING THE MAIN STREAM MEDIA.\nIT IS WORTH NOTING, THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME THAT WE'VE HAD A\nPOLITICIAN GO ON A PROGRAM THAT IS NOT MAIN STREAM MEDIA\nNECESSARILY, RIGHT? WE'VE SEEN THE OBAMAS DO IT ALL\nTHROUGH -- >> CLINTON JUST WENT ON KIMMEL\nYOU KNOW IN THIS FIRST BRUSH ABOUT HEALTH AND SHE WAS JOKING\nABOUT IT. >> THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT\nVENUES, BUT CLEARLY A STUNT. >> HERE IS A MOMENT FROM DR. OZ\nAND DONALD TRUMP'S EXCHANGE. WATCH THIS.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT STAMINA. YOU USE THAT WORD A LOT.\nYOU MADE IT AN ISSUE IN THIS CAMPAIGN.\nYOU ARGUE THAT A PRESIDENT HAS TO HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF\nSTAMINA. IF ELECTED AT AGE 70 YOU WILL BE\nTHE OLDEST PERSON TO EVER ENTER THE OVAL OFFICE.\nWHY DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE THE STAMINA FOR THE JOB?\n>> JUST ABOUT THE SAME AGE AS RONALD REAGAN AND HILLARY IS A\nYEAR BEHIND ME. JUST BASED ON MY LIFE, I\nACTUALLY, I DON'T KNOW IF THIS MAKES SENSE, I FEEL AS GOOD\nTODAY AS I DID WHEN I WAS 30. >> SANJAY, WHAT ELSE WAS\nREVEALED ON THE SHOW ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S HEALTH?\n>> FIRST, I WISH I FELT AS GOOD AS I DID WHEN I WAS 30.\nWE'RE GOING TO, OBVIOUSLY, SEE THE FULL SHOW WHEN HE HAS THE\nRESULTS RELEASED LATER TODAY. I TALKED TO DR. OZ YESTERDAY AND\nASKED ABOUT THIS. ONE THING HE ZEROED IN ON WAS\nHEART. DR. OZ IS A HEART SURGEON.\nHE HAD A CT OF HIS HEART LOOKING FOR CALCIUM.\nTHAT LOOKED GOOD. ALSO AN ECOCARDIOGRAM OF HIS\nHEART AND VARIOUS LAB TESTS. HOW DR. OZ SORT OF SUMMARIZED IT\nFOR ME IS HE SAID THOSE TESTS ALL LOOK GOOD FOR A MAN OF HIS\nAGE. >> HIS WEIGHT WAS A QUESTION.\n>> HIS WEIGHT IS A QUESTION BECAUSE WE'RE NOT EXACTLY SURE\nWHAT HIS WEIGHT IS I HEARD 236 AND I HEARD 267 AND AUDIENCE\nMEMBERS HEARD THAT AND HE IS 6'3\" IN HEIGHT.\n>> THAT WOULD BE OVERWEIGHT. IF IT WERE 267 AND HE'S 6'2\" OR\n6'3\", HE WOULD BE OOBESE. >> BMI OF ANYTHING OVER 30 IS\nCONSIDERED OBESE. IF HE WAS 236 HE WOULD BE\nOVERWEIGHT. >> NOW, WE ALL RESPECT THE\nMEDICAL PROFESSION VERY MUCH, BUT THESE NUMBERS THAT WE'RE\nGETTING FROM THEM, WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE THAT THESE ARE THE\nNUMBERS, RIGHT? BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GETTING ANY\nRAW MATERIAL. HOW MUCH SKEPTICISM DO YOU FEEL\nCOMFORTABLE PUTTING INTO THIS? THIS ISN'T AN ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTHAT HAS FORENSICALLY GONE OVER DATA.\nDOCTORS WHO SANJAY HAS SAID IN THE PAST, A CULIE COLIEGEALITY .\nHOW MUCH BACKUP SHOULD WE ASK FOR WHEN WE HAVE NOT GOTTEN\nBACKUP BEFORE EXCEPT FOR McCAIN? >> I THINK THE QUESTION HERE IS\nA FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION OF BOTH TRUST OF THE CANDIDATE TO, YOU\nKNOW, A SECONDARY DEGREE TRUST TO THE PEOPLE THEY'RE HIRING TO\nPROVIDE THE INFORMATION. THAT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL\nQUESTION. IF YOU THINK DONALD TRUMP IS\nSOMEONE WHO SAYS HE WEIGHS 236 POUNDS INSTEAD OF 267.\nHE COULD STAND ON A SCALE -- >> THAT IS A DIFFERENT SHOW.\nTHAT IS \"THE BIGGEST LOSER\" SHOW.\n>> HE WOULD NEVER BE ON THAT SHOW.\nJUST THE TITLE ALONE. >> SO MANY QUESTIONS IN THIS\nCAMPAIGN WHERE WE HAVE TO TAKE THE CANDIDATES ON TRUST.\nMORE OF AN ISSUE THIS YEAR THAN WE HAVE SEEN IN PAST CAMPAIGNS\nBECAUSE SO MUCH OF THIS CAMPAIGN HAS QUESTIONED THE EXTENT TO\nWHICH WE CAN TRUST CANDIDATES IN GENERAL, MUCH LESS THESE TWO\nCANDIDATES. >> HE'S PLAYING TO AN ADVANTAGE\nHERE ANY WAY YOU LOOK AT IT. HILLARY CLINTON HAD THE EPISODE\nWHERE SHE FAINTED AND FELL ON TO THAT VAN.\nSHE HAD THE 2012 EPISODE AND NOT HIM.\nNEVER A CHECK ON HIS HEALTH. HE EATS McDONALD'S AND RUNS\nAROUND LIKE A MACHINE. >> THEY BOTH RUN AROUND LIKE A\nMACHINE IN TERMS OF THEIR STAMINA.\nI'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH VOTERS WANT TO HEAR ABOUT COLONOSCOPY\nRESULTS. >> ALL DAY.\n>> I LOOK AT THOSE IN MY FREE TIME.\nFORGET ABOUT WORK TIME. >>> DONALD TRUMP IS NOW ON TOP\nIN SEVERAL BATTLEGROUND STATE",

THAT SHE WAS AND THEN WE ALSO\nLEARNED THAT BACK IN JANUARY SHE HAD HAD SINUSITIS AND AN EAR\nINFECTION THAT GOT BAD ENOUGH WITH FLUID IN HER EAR THAT SHE\nHAD TO HAVE A TUBE INSERTED INTO HER LEFT EAR.\nTHAT IS LEAD UP TO THE IOWA CAUCUSES FULL STEAM AHEAD ON THE\nCAMPAIGN TRAIL AND SHE WENT THROUGH THAT.\nALL OF THIS INFORMATION COMING OUT BRINGS HER TO THE STANDARD\nOF MITT ROMNEY AND BARACK OBAMA IN 2012.\nNOT CERTAINLY TO THE STANDARD OF JOHN McCAIN WHERE REH EHNEHE RE\nPAGES OF MEDICAL RECORDS. BUT SHE HAS A LOT MORE OUT THERE\nTHAN DONALD TRUMP AND WE'VE KNOWN A LOT MORE ABOUT HER\nMEDICAL HISTORY OVER THE LAST YEAR THAN DONALD TRUMP.\nA DEEP VAIN THROMBOSIS. AND THE 2012 CONCUSSION SHE\nSUFFERED AFTER FAINTING THAT LED TO THE BLOOD CLOT BETWEEN HER\nSKULL AND BRAIN. >> DR. SANJAY GUPTA JOINS US\nNOW. AN EVALUATION OF WHAT YOU\nLEARNED. >> WE GOT A MUCH BETTER\nEXPLANATION AS BRIANNA SAID ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED OVER THE\nPAST FEW DAYS. THIS PNEUMONIA THAT WAS\nDIAGNOSED BY A CAT SCAN AS WELL. THIS YEAR IT IS INTERESTING\nSHE'S HAD A SCAN OF HER BRAIN, HER LUNGS AND OF HER HEART AS\nWELL. SHE HAS A HISTORY OF HEART\nDISEASE IN HER FAMILY. AND ALL THOSE LOOKED GOOD.\nKNOWING THAT HER BRAIN SCAN NOW LOOKS GOOD WAS AN IMPORTANT\nPOINT AFTER THE CONCUSSION. THIS IS NOT A FULL RELEASE OF\nMEDICAL RECORDS BY BIANY MEANS BUT AS BRIANNA SAID THIS IS MORE\nTHAN WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST AND CERTAINLY MORE THAN WE'VE SEEN\nFROM MR. TRUMP. >> AND ON THAT NOTE, TONIGHT WE\nARE LEARNING SOME NEW INFORMATION ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S\nHEALTH. BECAUSE HE GAVE THE RESULTS OF\nHIS RECENT PHYSICAL TO TV'S DR. OZ DURING A TAPED INTERVIEW.\nDR. OZ TELLING NBC NEWS HE WAS ACTUALLY CAUGHT OFF GUARD BY\nWHAT TRUMP REVEALED. HE DIDN'T EXPECT DONALD TRUMP TO\nHAND HIM THAT SHEET OF PAPER WITH THE DETAILS.\nHERE IS HOW HE PUT IT. >> I WAS, YOU KNOW, SURPRISED.\nI LOOKED AT THEM AND TRY TO PROCESS IT PRETTY QUICKLY.\nAND IF I WAS A DOCTOR, IF HE WAS MY PATIENT ARE THEY ARE GOOD FOR\nA MAN OF HIS AGE. >> WHAT DID IT SAID.\n>> DETAILS FROM A COLONOSCOPY HE HAD A FEW YEARS AGO.\nA CALCIUM SCAN OF HIS HEART THAT WAS DONE THAT LOOKED GOOD.\nHE HAD RESULTS FROM CHEST X-RAIES AND EKGS AND THE LABOTT\nRESULTS FROM LAST WEEK. >> TYPICALLY NOT THE WAY WE SEE\nCANDIDATES RELEASE THAT KIND OF INFORMATION AND THE DRAMA REALLY\nHEIGHTENED THIS MORNING BECAUSE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN SAYING NO\nTRUMP IS NOT GOING TO RELEASE THE RESULTS OF HIS PHYSICAL\nTODAY ON THE DR. OZ SHOW AND HEENEDED UP DOING JUST THAT,\nPULLING IT OUT OF HIS POCKET AND GIVING IT TO DR. OZ.\nTHIS IS JUST A ONE-PAGE SUMMARY OF THE PHYSICAL THAT HE HAD LAST\nWEEK. AND IT HAS NOT YET BEEN PUBLICLY\nRELEASED. THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN SAYS THEY\nWILL GET TO THAT TOMORROW. THEY LIKELY WILL RELEASE THAT\nTOMORROW. BUT CNN WAS OUTSIDE OF THE SHOW.\nWE TALKED TO MANY AUDIENCE MEMBERS WHO WERE INSIDE FOR THE\nTAPING AND -- SMALL PICTURE OF WHAT DONALD TRUMP'S HEALTH\nREALLY LOOKS LIKE. -- AUDIENCE MEMBER WHO SAYS SHE\nWEIGHS 236 POUNDS. HE SAYS HE DOES NOT EXERCISE AND\nTHAT HE WOULD LIKE TO LOSE BETWEEN 15 AND 20 POUNDS AND HE\nIS ON STATINS, DRUGS THAT HELP LOWER CHOLESTEROL LEVELS.\nTOMORROW WHEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS ANTICIPATED TO RELEASE THIS\nMEDICAL SUMMARY FROM HIS POSITION, IT SHOULD BE NOTED\nTHAT THIS STILL IS NOT ONE THE RESULT OF WHAT THAT PHYSICAL WAS\nLIKE BUT TWO NOT A FULL DISCLOSURE OF HIS MEDICAL\nHISTORY AND DOCUMENTS THAT WOULD BE MORE IN LINE WITH PREVIOUS\nPRESIDENTIAL NOMINEES. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nAND OUT FRONT NOW, PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FORMER DOCTOR.\nAND -- MAGGIE, JUST IN TERMS OF STYLE\nTODAY. YOU GET THE LETTER AND THE LIST\nOF THINGS FROM HILLARY CLINTON TODAY.\nDONALD TRUMP GOING OUT ON DR. OZ, AND I'VE GOT IT.\nHERE IT IS. AND NOW EVEN NOW WE'RE NOT\nGETTING THE FORMAL RESULTS PUBLICLY TILL TOMORROW.\n>> WHAT HAVE WE GOT? WE KNOW WHAT HE WEIGHS.\nTHAT IS THE NEW THING WE LEARNED.\nWE KNEW HE WAS ON STATIN BEFORE, A FORM OF, FROM THE VERY UNUSUAL\nLETTER HIS DOCTOR WROTE A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO.\nWE ALSO KNOW FROM THAT NOTE THAT THE DOCTOR SAID IN THAT LETTER\nTHAT TRUMP HAD LOST 15 POUNDS OVER THE PREVIOUS YEAR.\nI DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS TRUMP WEIGHED BEFORE.\nI DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS NOW.\nHE DID THIS WITH HIS USUAL STYLE.\nHE WASN'T GOING TO RELIES T. HE IS GOING TO RELIES IT.\nTHAT OBSCURES THE FACT THIS IS STILL A PRETTY LOW LEVEL OF\nDISCLOSURE FOR A PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE.\nAND I DON'T KNOW HOICH MORE WE'RE GOING SEE WHEN THEY MAKE\nTHE RELEASE LATER THIS WEEK. >> AND SANJAY, IN TERMS OF WHAT\nWE'RE GOING TO GET, ONE COULD PRESUME THE THINGS THAT WERE\nDISCUSSED IN THIS INTERVIEW WITH DR. OZ, CHOLESTEROL, STATINS,\nBLOOD PRESSURE, BUT WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE WHAT ELSE.\n>> AND I TALKED TO DR. OZ A LITTLE TODAY AS WELL.\nAND YOU HEARD HIM TALK ABOUT. HE'S A CARDIO THORACIC SURGEON\nSO CERTAINLY SOMETHING HE WAS LOOKING FOR WAS A HEART.\nAND EKGS AND THE CONNECTICUT -- CT SCAN OF THE HEART.\nTHOSE COULD BE IMPORTANT TESTS TO RELAY ANY CONCERNS ABOUT\nHEART DISEASE. >> WHEN HE ADMITS HE DOESN'T\nEXERCISE AND HE'S OVERWEIGHT. >> AND A STATIN DRUG.\nAND THAT IS WHAT YOU WOULD REALLY WANT TO ZERO O IN ON.\n>> AND DOCTOR, FIRST OF ALL, YOU ARE SUPPORTING HILLARY CLINTON.\nBUT YOU HAVE TOLD ME ON THE SHOW THAT YOU WANTED A FULL\nNEUROLOGICAL EXAM. YOU WANTED THOSE RESULTS.\nOBVIOUSLY WE'RE NOT GETTING A FULL MEDICAL HISTORY HERE IN\nEITHER CASE. WE CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE THAT ON\nTHE NEURALLOGICAL SIDE. ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH WHAT YOU\nNOW HAVE. >> I WAS VERY IMPRESSED SHE GOT\nA CT SCAN. BY THAT ALONE I'M VERY IMPRESSED\nWITH HER DOCTOR. BUT I THINK BOTH KLDS SHOULD\nHAVE WHAT WE CALL NEUROPSYCHOLOGIC TESTING.\n-- BOTH CANDIDATES. I THINK SHE NEEDS\nNEUROPSYCHOLOGIC TESTING JUST TO SEE THERE'S NO NEUROLOGIC\nSEQUELAE FROM HER INJURY. AND TRUMP I THINK NEEDS A\nNEUROPSYCHOLOGIC BECAUSE OF HIS ERRATIC BEHAVIOR.\nIF SOMEBODY CAME INTO MY OFFICE WITH THAT KIND OF -- THE KIND OF\nTHINGS THAT HE DOES, I WOULD REALLY BE WONDERING ABOUT THE\nPERSONALITY. I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S -- WE KNOW\nHE'S GOT A NARCISSISTIC PERSONALITY DISORDER AT THE VERY\nLEAST. BUT I SOMETIMES WONDER IF HE\nWOULD EVEN BE HYPOMANIC. BUT I THINK PSYCHOLOGIC TESTING\nWOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR HIM. IS SOMETHING I THINK MAYBE\nSHOULD BE FOR ALL CANDIDATES. >> WHEN YOU SAY ALL CANDIDATES\nAND OBVIOUSLY THERE IS SOME SPECULATION IF WHAT THE DOCTOR\nWAS SAYING THERE. GOING THIS IS GOING TO BE THE\nFINAL POINT OF THIS. WE'RE NOT GOING GET A DEEP\nMEDICAL HISTORY FROM EITHER ONE. >> OF COURSE NOT.\nTHERE IS NO LAW THAT REQUIRES ANY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE NEEDS\nTO PUT ANY RECORDS OUT QUITE FRANKLY.\nAS FAR AS ANY KIND OF MENTAL TESTING.\nLAST TIME I THINK WE EVEN SAW THAT WAS BACK IN McGOVERN IN\n'72. AND [INDISCERNIBLE]\n. WHAT WE SAW TODAY WAS A MADE FOR\nTV MOMENT THAT DONALD TRUMP CREATED AND HE DID IT ON A SHOW\nTO TRY TO REACH A CERTAIN VOTER, WHICH WAS WOMEN.\nAND AS MAGGIE SAID, IT WAS A GAME FOR DONALD TRUMP.\n>> BUT THAT IS THE AUDIENCE HE NEEDS TO REACH.\nAND THAT IS THE AUDIENCE OF THAT SHOW.\n>> IT IS THE AUDIENCE HE NEEDS TO REACH IT'S INTERESTING\nBECAUSE WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS A SUMMARY THAT SOMEONE ELSE HAS\nPUT TOGETHER, USUALLY WITH INPUT FROM THE CAMPAIGN OF THE MEDICAL\nRECORDS BY SOMEONE WHO MAY ALSO BE A FRIEND OR AT LEAST HAVE A\nCOLLEGIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CANDIDATE.\nYOU HAVE TO TAKE ALL THAT INTO ACCOUNT.\nPART OF THE REASON YOU ASK FOR THE MEDICAL RECORDS.\nSO YOU CAN GET DISPASSIONATE REVIEW.\nBUT THE POINT IS WE DON'T KNOW EVEN WHAT WE DON'T KNOW.\nNOT TO SUGGEST THERE IS SOMETHING THERE.\nWE DON'T KNOW. THAT IS SORT OF THE POINT.\nI DON'T KNOW THAT WE SHOULD BE MAKING DIAGNOSES, EVEN\nPSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSES FROM ITHE. IT WAS INTERESTING AT THE END OF\nSECRETARY CLINTON'S NOTE THE DOCTOR WROTE \"I BELIEVE HER\nMENTAL HEALTH IS GOOD\". >> SHE'S NOT A PSYCHIATRIST.\n>> RIGHT. >> IN BOTH CASES THEY ARE\nGETTING LETTERS FROM DOCTORS WHO HAVE KNOWN THEM AND WORKED WITH\nTHEM FOR MANY, MANY YEARS.

OZ THIS MORNING, WHAT DID HE SHARE?\n>> HE TOLD ME THAT -- IT WAS INTERESTING, HE SAID THEY\nWEREN'T SURE WHEN THE SHOW STARTED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO\nGET ANY OF TRUMP'S MEDICAL RECORDS.\n>> AS EARLY AS THIS MORNING. >> SO HE DID WHAT'S CALLED A\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS WHICH BASICALLY MEANS I ASK YOU\nQUESTIONS, HAVE YOU HAD PROBLEMS WITH X, Y, Z, GETTING A MEDICAL\nHISTORY. HE PUSHED TRUMP FOR MORE\nTRANSPARENCY AND AT THAT POINT IS WHEN THIS ONE-PAGE LETTER WAS\nREVEALED, THE PAGE LETTER THAT YOU JUST HEARD DESCRIBED BY\nTHOSE GUESTS, GAVE NUMBERS ABOUT CHOLESTEROL AND BLOOD PRESSURE\nAND THINGS LIKE THAT. THAT'S THE WAY IT WENT DOWN.\nSO IT WASN'T AN EXAMPLE OF ANY SORT THERE AND IT SOUNDS LIKE IT\nWAS CURSORY IN TERMS OF WHAT WAS PROVIDED BY BUT EVEN UP UNTIL IT\nSOUNDS LIKE THIS MORNING WHEN THIS WAS ALL BEING PLANNED THEY\nWEREN'T SURE WHAT IF ANY MEDICAL RECORDS WOULD BE RELEASED.\n>> BUT THIS ONE PAGE, THIS WAS BASED UPON THE PHYSICAL FROM\nLAST WEEK, CORRECT? >> THAT'S RIGHT.\n>> SO BASED UPON WHAT WE'VE SEEN AND ALSO JUST HEARING HE SAYS HE\nWANTS TO LOSE 15 TO 20 POUNDS, HE USED TO HAVE HIGH\nCHOLESTEROL, TOOK MEDS TO HELP WITH THAT, YOUR OVERALL\nASSESSMENT? >> YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND OF HARD\nTO MAKE AN OVERALL ASSESSMENT. THERE'S NOTHING THAT'S A RED\nFLAG BUT THIS IS ALL SO STRANGE. YOU'RE JUST --\n>> IT'S OKAY, WE TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THAT OUT LOUD.\nIT'S STRANGE. >> TO SOMEHOW MAKE THIS MORE\nTHAN WHAT IT IS IS HARD TO DO. YOU'RE SEEING EXACTLY WHAT\nSOMEONE WANTS YOU TO SEE IN A FORGNAT IS HIGHLY UNUSUAL AND,\nYOU KNOW, THERE'S NO PATIENT/PHYSICIAN RELATIONSHIP\nHERE WHATSOEVER SO I JUST DON'T THINK YOU CAN MAKE ANYTHING OF\nIT GOOD OR BAD.

YOU WILL BE CASTING BALLOTS IN\nTHE DARK. BOTH CANDIDATES HERE FAMOUS BUT\nNOT NECESSARILY WELL KNOWN AND BOTH STILL KEEPING KEY DETAILS\nABOUT THEMSELVES OUT OF PUBLIC EYE.\nNOW DONALD TRUMP IS RESPONDING TO THE GROWING CHORUS OF DEMANDS\nRELEASING MORE DETAILS TODAY ON HIS OWN PERSONAL HEALTH.\nTHE WHOLE EPISODE GIVING POLITICAL OBSERVERS A PROVERBIAL\nCASE OF WHIPLASH. FIRST, THIS WAS HAILED TRUMP\nWOULD MAKE THE BIG REVEAL ON THE DR. OZ SHOW WHICH, BY THE WAY,\nTAPED THIS MORNING HERE IN NEW YORK.\nTHEN A COUPLE HOURS AHEAD OF WHEN TRUMP WAS SAID TO APPEAR\nTHE CAMPAIGN ACTUALLY SAID, NO, NO, THERE WILL BE NO DISCLOSURE\nOF THE PHYSICAL THAT HE UNDERWENT WITH HIS OWN PERSONAL\nDOCTOR LAST WEEK. BUT THEN TRUMP REVERSED COURSE,\nPRESENTING, ACCORDING TO THE CAMPAIGN, A ONE-PAGE SUMMARY OF\nHIS PHYSICAL EXAM RESULTS TO DR. OZ.\nSO WHAT DO THE RESULTS SHOW? LET'S GET TO KELLY PLAT WHO\nHAPPENED TO BE IN TODAY'S AUDIENCE, SHE'S A PHARMACIST\nINTERN WHO PLANS TO VOTE FOR TRUMP.\nSO, KELLY, THANKS FOR STOPPING BY AND WELCOME.\n>> THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME. >> SO HOW DID IT GO?\nHOW HEALTHY IS DONALD TRUMP? >> I THINK THE SHOW WENT VERY\nWELL, I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH DONALD TRUMP, IMPRESSED WITH HIS\nHEALTH REPORT. THE CROWD WAS EXCITED TO SEE HIM\nTHERE. IT WAS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME\nOPPORTUNITY TO BE THERE TO HEAR HIS SPEECH, TO HEAR HIS -- I\nWOULD SAY HIS PLANS FOR EVERYBODY, PLANS FOR THINGS THAT\nHE WANTS TO IMPLEMENT IN THE UNITED STATES.\n>> OKAY, LET'S JUST STAY ON HIS HEALTH, IF WE CAN, KELLY, AND I\nUNDERSTAND HE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IN THE PAST HAVING\nHIGHER CHOLESTEROL AND THAT HE WANTS TO LOSE A LITTLE BIT OF\nWEIGHT. WHAT DO YOU RECALL FROM THAT\nPIECE OF THE CONVERSATION? >> WELL, I KNOW HE STATED THAT\nHE GAVE LETTERS FROM HIS DOCTORS THAT HE IS THE EPITOME OF HEALTH\nAND I BELIEVE HIM ON THAT, YOU CAN SEE IT.\nHE LOOKS IT. YOU CAN SEE HE'S A VERY HEALTHY\nMAN AND DR. OZ AGREED WITH HIM AFTER DR. OZ EVEN READ THE\nLETTERS FROM HIS PHYSICIAN AND EVERYBODY CAN HAVE THE\nOPPORTUNITY TO LOSE A LITTLE WEIGHT, JUST BE HEALTHIER AND\nLOWER YOUR CHOLESTEROL AND THAT'S ONE THING DONALD TRUMP\nMENTIONED WAS THAT HIS CHOLESTEROL WAS HIGH AT ONE TIME\nAND HE WAS PUT ON STATINS TO LOWER HIS CHOLESTEROL AND HE HAS\nZERO HEALTH ISSUES, HE HAS NO HEART PROBLEMS AND NO OTHER\nHEALTH ISSUES WHICH WILL BE HARMING HIM FOR HIS PRESIDENTIAL\nRUN. >> DID HE TALK, KELLY, AT ALL --\nYOU TALK HOW HE'S THE EPITOME OF HEALTH.\nDID HE TALK ABOUT WHAT HE EATS. I KNOW HE HAS A PENCHANT FOR\nFAST FOOD ON THE TRAIL. >> SORRY, CAN YOU REPEAT THAT?\n>> CANDID HE TALK ABOUT WHAT HE EATS?\n>> HE EATS VERY HEALTHY FROM WHAT HE SAID.\nOCCASIONALLY HE MIGHT WANT TO GO FOR A QUICK HAMBURGER.\nBUT THAT ICE -- WHOEVER HAS TO GO FOR A QUICK HAMBURGER IF\nTHEY'RE HUNGRY IF THEY GO TO A FAST FOOD PLACE.\nAS LONG AS YOU DON'T GO FREQUENTLY, EVERYBODY CAN BE ON\nA HEALTHY FOOD PLAN. >> I KNOW HE'S A BUSY MAN, I\nCAN'T IMAGINE THE ZIGZAGGING AHEAD OF NOVEMBER 8 BUT DOES HE\nEXERCISE? DID HE TALK ABOUT THAT AT ALL?\n>> HE SAID HE DOES NOT EXERCISE BUT JUST GOING TO ALL THESE\nFUNCTIONS WHERE HE'S MEETING WITH 35,000 PEOPLE, 45,000\nPEOPLE AND YOU'RE SITTING WALKING THROUGH EVERYONE, TO ME\nTHAT IS EXERCISE SO YOU MAY NOT BE GOING TO THE GYM AND LIFTING\nWEIGHTS BUT GOING TO ALL THESE POLITICAL FUNCTIONS WHERE HE'S\nCONSTANTLY WALKING, WALKING IS VERY GOOD AND WALKING IS A PART\nOF THE EXERCISE REGIMEN. >> DID HE SAY ANYTHING THAT\nSURPRISED YOU OR DID YOU HAVE A FAVORITE MOMENT?\n>> I KNOW HE LIKES TO PLAY GOLF BUT HE HASN'T HAD TIME TO PLAY A\nLOT OF GOLF, BEING ON THE PRESIDENTIAL RUN AND THE\nCAMPAIGN TRAIL, THERE'S NOT A LOT OF TIME FOR EXTRA CURRICULAR\nACTIVITIES WHERE HE CAN GO PLAY GOLF BUT I KNOW HE CAN PLAY GOLF\nWITH THE PGA PLAYERS AND I BELIEVE HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH\nON THAT. >> HE SAID -- HE REMARKED HE'S\nSO GOOD AT GOLF HE COULD DO THE PGA TOUR.\nKELLY PLAT, YOU HAD QUITE THE EXPERIENCE TODAY.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING IT, FAST FOOD AND DR. OZ,\nWELCOME TO THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL RACE.\nLET'S TALK BIGGER PICTURE HERE. JOINING ME, A DOCTOR WHO IS AN\nASSISTANT PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SCHOOL OF\nMEDICINE, MARK PRESTON IS OUR CNN POLITICAL EDITOR AND WITH\nDREW GRIFFIN, CNN INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT SO HELLO TO ALL OF\nYOU. FIRST TO YOU AS THE DOCTOR, AS\nTHE M.D. ON THE SET, MY QUESTION IS, LISTENING TO KELLY AND\nHEARING SPECIFICALLY TRUMP SAID HE WANTED TO LOSE 15 TO 20\nPOUNDS, SHE SAID EPITOME OF HEALTH.\nTOTAL TRANSPARENCY, YOU'VE NEVER EXAMINED MR. TRUMP.\n>> SURE. >> QUICK ASSESS.\n>> IN GENERAL, FOR SOMEBODY WHO'S THAT AGE WHO HAD HIGH\nCHOLESTEROL IN THE PAST WHO LIKES FAST FOOD YOU'D SCREEN FOR\nHEART DISEASE TO MAKE SURE THAT CARDIO\nCARDIOVASCULARLY, THAT PERSON IS OKAY.\n>> SHE SAYS HE SPEAKS TO 45,000 PERSON CROWD AND THAT'S\nEXERCISE. YOUR ASSESSMENT?\n>> WALKING A LOT IS. WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT PEOPLE\nHAVING A SEDENTARY LIFE-STYLE BUT THERE'S NO STANDARD HISTORY\nIN PHYSICAL EXAM. THERE'S THREE DIFFERENT WAYS\nDOCTORS APPROACH IT. FIRST THEY LOOK AT THE SYMPTOMS\nPEOPLE ARE REPORTING SO FOR HIM THE FOCUS WOULD BE A LITTLE MORE\nON HIS CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH. THEN PEOPLE DO GENERAL SCREENING\nTESTS SO FOR EXAMPLE WHAT KIND OF TESTS WOULD YOU DO WITH THAT\nPERSON AND THEN THERE'S A THIRD TYPE OF TEST WHERE YOU HAVE A\nPRE-OP TEST, CAN YOU STAND THE STRESS OF PRESIDENCY AND DO MORE\nINTENSIVE TESTS BASED ON THAT. >> SO WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE\nWAS TOLD TO HOP ON A TREADMILL, BLOOD TESTS THAT KIND OF THING,\nWE DON'T HAVE THAT.

OZ BEING\nTRANSPARENT THE DAY AFTER HE ANNOUNCED A BIG NEW PROPOSAL FOR\nA BIG GOVERNMENT SPENDING PROGRAM ON PAY MATERNITY LEAVE.\n>> IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. AND YOU WONDER WHAT KIND OF\nPRESSURE THIS IS GOING TO PUT ON HILLARY CLINTON AND HER CAMP TO\nRELEASE MORE OF HER MEDICAL HISTORY BECAUSE ACCORDING TO DR.\nOZ, HE WENT THROUGH A FULL REVIEW OF TRUMP'S SYSTEMS, AND\nLAUNDRY LISTED NERVOUS SYSTEM, HEAD AND NECK, HORMONE LEVELS,\nCARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH. I MEAN OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF PEOPLE\nARE GOING TO TUNE IN INTO THAT AND SEE HOW THAT WENT.\nHIS DOCTOR SAYS HE IS HEALTHY AND FIT TO BE PRESIDENT, BUT\nHILLARY CLINTON, WE'RE STILL WAITING, THEY ARE PROMISING THAT\nWE WILL SEE MORE OF HER MEDICAL HISTORY LATER ON THIS WEEK.\n>> WELL, TO BE FAIR, SHE HAD BEEN A LOT MORE TRANSPARENT UP\nUNTIL NOW THAN DONALD TRUMP HAD AS YOU REMEMBER, HE HAD HIS\nGASTROSBROLGS SEND A TWO-PARAGRAPH NOTE WHILE THE\nLIMOUSINE WAITING OUTSIDE SAID THAT TRUMP WILL BE THE\nHEALTHIEST PRESIDENT IN HISTORY, BUT AT THIS POINT, THE HEALTH\nTRANSPARENCY GAP NOW WORKS IN TRUMP'S FAVOR BECAUSE OF THE DR.\nOZ INCIDENT. SO SHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO GO ON\nSOME REALITY TV SHOW AND RELEASE ALL OF HER -- SERIOUSLY\nSPEAKING, SHE IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE MORE FORTHCOMING\nPARTICULARLY AFTER THIS HEALTH SCARE OVER THE WEEKEND.\n>> ABOUT THE WEIGHT LOSS YOU HEARD, APPARENTLY DONALD TRUMP\nSAID TO DR. OZ HE WOULD LIKE TO LOSE 15 TO 20 POUNDS, DR. OZ\nAGREED IS WHAT DR. OZ'S SHOW HAS TOLD US.\nFORMER SECRETARY OF STATE COLON POWELL REVEALING, CHRIS, HOW HE\nREALLY FEELS ABOUT BOTH OF THESE CANDIDATES.\nHACKERS LEAKING COLON POWELL'S PRIVATE E-MAILS.\nPOUFL WAS CALLING TRUMP A NATIONAL DISGRACE AND AN\nINTERNATIONAL PARIAH. HE ALSO SLAMS CLINTON FOR TRYING\nTO MAKE HIM A SCAPEGOAT IN THE HER E-MAIL SCANNEDING SAYING I\nTOLD HER STAFF THREE TIMES. I HAD TO THROW A MINI TANTRUM TO\nGET THEIR ATTENTION. SHE KEEPS TRIPPING INTO THESE\nCHARACTER MINE FIELDS. WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THESE\nE-MAIL REVELATIONS, CHRIS? >> WELL, I HAVE TO SAY, I MAKE\nMORE OF WHAT POWELL IS SAYING ABOUT CLINTON.\nPOWELL HAS BECOME A REPUBLICAN IN NAME ONLY.\nIF YOU REMEMBER HE SUPPORTED BARACK OBAMA AGAINST McCAIN IN\n2008, OBAMA AGAINST ROMNEY IN 2012, SO NO SURPRISE THAT HE\nWOULD NOT -- THE LANGUAGE IS KIND OF TOUGH, BUT NO SURPRISE\nTHAT HE WOULDN'T HAVE MUCH USE FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nBUT YOU CAN TELL, HE IS GENUINELY UPSET BY THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGNS. AND IT HAS BEEN AN EFFORT ON\nTHEIR PART TO SAY WELL SHE WAS JUST FOLLOWING THE ADVICE OF\nCOLON POWELL WHEN SHE SAID UP THIS PRIVATE SYSTEM.\nTHE FACT IS, THEY WERE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS.\nPOWELL DIDN'T HAVE A PRIVATE SERVER IN HIS BASEMENT, HE WAS\nUSING AOL.COM BACK IN 2005, OR 2000 RATHER, BACK WHEN THE WHOLE\nE-MAIL SYSTEM AND THE INTERNET WAS ALL COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.\nSO, YOU KNOW, I THINK WITH SOME JUSTICE, HE IS UPSET AT THE\nIDEAS. HE IS TRYING TO DRAG HIM INTO\nTHIS AND MAKE IT SEEM LIKE HE WAS THE REASON THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON SET UP THE PRIVATE SERVER.\n>> THERE WAS ALSO AN E-MAIL EXCHANGE WITH A DEMOCRATIC E\nMEGA DONOR, JEFFREY LEADS WAS IN THERE DEPICTING HER AS A SORE\nLOSER WHEN SHE LOST TO BARACK OBAMA SAYING SHE HATES THAT THE\nPRESIDENT KICKED HER BUTT IN 2008.\nSHE USED A DIFFERENT WORD THERE, BUT HE WENT ON TO SAY NO ONE\nLIKES HER AND THE CRIMINAL THING AIN'T OVER.\nI DON'T THINK THE PRESIDENT WOULD WEEP IF SHE FOUND HERSELF\nIN REAL LEGAL TROUBLE. WAS THIS ALSO VERY REVEALING OF\nTHE JITTERS THAT THE PARTY, THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN GENERAL IS\nFEELING RIGHT NOW OVER HILLARY CLINTON AND RECENT POLLING?\n>> OH SURE. LOOK, THIS RACE IS TIGHTENING,\nAND IT'S TIGHTENING I THINK FOR TWO REASONS.\nONE, DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN A MORE DISCIPLINED, BETTER\nCANDIDATE OVER THE LAST THREE, FOUR WEEKS SINCE HIS NEW TEAM\nTOOK OVER, AND AGAIN, THIS GOES TO THE PERSONALITY TRANSPLANT.\nHE IS DELIVERING MORE SPEECHES ON TELEPROMPTER, MORE POLICY IN\nHIS SPEECHES. YOU KNOW, THERE'VE BEEN SOME\nBUMPS IN THE ROAD, FOR INSTANCE GOING DOWN TO MEXICO, HAVING\nTHAT MEETING WITH THE MEXICAN PRESIDENT, THEN COMING BACK AND\nSEEMING TO GO BACK ON THE IDEA HE WAS GOING TO SOFTEN HIS\nPOSITION ON IMMIGRATION AND IN FACT DELIVERING A HARD LINE\nPOSITION, BUT MEANWHILE, THE NEWS HAS BEEN ALMOST ALL BAD FOR\nHILLARY CLINTON FOR SEVERAL WEEKS NOW.\nMORE REVELATIONS ABOUT THE E-MAIL, THE FBI 15,000 E-MAILS\nTHEY WERE ABLE TO RECOVER, THE COZY CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION, THE STATE DEPARTMENT, NOW THE HEALTH\nSCARE. SO NOT SURPRISINGLY ALL OF THIS\nHAS LED TO HIS RISE IN THE POLLS AND HER DECLINE.\nSTILL, VERY MUCH SHE'S STILL THE FAVORITE, BUT IF HE IS AHEAD BY\nFIVE POINTS IN OHIO, THAT'S A VERY TELLING SIGN.\nTHAT IS A, YOU KNOW, THE SWINGINGEST OF SWING STATES AND\nONE THAT THE REPUBLICANS ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO HAVE.\n>> THERE IS SO MUCH GOING ON IN THIS HORSE RACE AND YOU HAVE\nINTERESTING GUESTS ON FOX NEWS SUNDAY.\nWHO DO YOU HAVE? >> TOP OFFICIALS OF BOTH THE\nTRUMP AND CLINTON COMPANIES, BUT ALSO WE'RE GOING TO TALK TO\nGEORGE CLOONEY AND JOHN PRENDERGST.\nFASCINATING INVESTIGATION THEY'VE UNDERTAKEN.\nTHE HUMAN RIGHTS IN AFRICA, THEY HAVE SET UP SOMETHING CALLED THE\nCENTURY WHICH IS UNCOVERED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THEFT AND\nCORRUPTION IN SOUTH SUDAN. THE NEWEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD\nWITH MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN THAT COUNTRY BEING CAUGHT IN THE\nCROSS FIRE. WE'LL BE TALKING GEORGE CLOONEY\nABOUT THAT AND ALSO TALK SOME POLITICS, ALL COMING UP ON FOX\nNEWS SUNDAY. >> VERY GOOD STUFF, CHRIS\nWALLACE, THANKS FOR JOINING THUS AFTERNOON, GOOD TO HAVE YOU.\n>> YOU BET.",

YOU CAN BE PHOTOGRAPHED\nABOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE AND PEOPLE CAN LISTEN TO YOUR\nPRIVATE CONVERSATIONS WHILE YOU ARE IN YOUR HOME USING\nTECHNOLOGY. WHAT AN AWFUL SITUATION.\nENTER COLIN POWELL ONE OF THE SAVVIEST POLITICAL\nPLAYERS IN AMERICA. THE FORMER SECRETARY OF\nSTATE PLAYS BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE AND HAS SUCCEEDED\nIN DOING THAT FOR DECADES. NOW HACKERS HAVE ATTACKED\nHIM AND THE PRESIDENTIAL VOTE MAY BE AFFECTED.\nSPEAKING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP IN AN EMAIL, POWELL SAID\nTHIS QUOTE:  THERE IS NOTHING HE CAN SAY THAT WILL\nSWAY BLACK VOTERS. HE TAKES US FOR IDIOTS.\nTHE WHOLE BIRTHER MOVEMENT WAS RACIST.\nAND FOR TRUMP TO SAY YESTERDAY THAT WITHIN FOUR\nYEARS HE WOULD HAVE 9 5% OF BLACKS VOTING FOR HIM IS\nSCHIZO FANTASY, UNQUOTE. THAT SHOULD COME AS NO\nSURPRISE, COLIN POWELL HAS NEVER BEEN A FAN OF DONALD\nTRUMP. EVEN THOUGH HE IS A\nREPUBLICAN, IS HE MORE FAVORABLE TOWARDS HILLARY\nCLINTON OR SO IT SEEMED. THE HACKERS PUT THIS OUT\nTHERE, QUOTE:  SAD THING HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON COULD\nHAVE KILLED THIS TWO YEARS AGO BY MERELY TELLING\nEVERYONE HONESTLY WHAT SHE HAD DONE ABOUT THE EMAILS.\nAND NOT TIE ME INTO IT. I TOLD HER STAFF THREE TIMES\nNOT TO TRY THAT GAM BIT. I HAD TO THROW A MINI\nTANTRUM AT A PARTY TO GET THEIR ATTENTION.\nPOWELL AS YOU MAY KNOW USED PRIVATE EMAIL HIMSELF AS\nSECRETARY OF STATE BUT NOT NEARLY TO THE EXTENT\nMRS. CLINTON DID. THE GENERAL CONTINUED WITH\nANOTHER EMAIL QUOTE. BEEN HAVING FUN WITH EMAIL\nGATE. HILLARY'S MAFIA KEEPS TRYING\nTO SUCK ME IN TO IT. NOW, A GUY LIKE COLIN POWELL\nCAN BE HACKED, ANYBODY CAN THE EFFECT ON THE VOTE WILL\nPROBABLY BE MINIMAL. BUT WE CAN EXPECT MORE\nHACKING STUFF BETWEEN NOW AND ELECTION DAY.\nHACKING ASIDE, DONALD TRUMP SEEMS TO BE GAINING IN THE\nRACE RIGHT NOW. AT LEAST TWO NEW POLLS SAY\nTHAT ACCORDING TO REUTERS, HILLARY CLINTON'S SUPPORT IS\nNOW 40%, TRUMP 39% AMONG LIKELY VOTERS.\nTHE \"L.A. TIMES\" DAILY TRACKING POLL HAS IT 47% FOR\nTRUMP. 42 FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nMUST BE GOING NUT OUT THERE IN HILLARY CLINTON.\nALSO, NEW BLOOMBERG POLL HAS TRUMP UP BY 5 IN OHIO.\nAND MONMOUTH POLL OUT TODAY OF NEVADA VOTERS HAS TRUMP\nUP 44%, CLINTON 42. BACK IN JULY CLINTON WAS UP\nIN NEVADA BY 4. WHILE MID SEPTEMBER POLLS\nARE INTERESTING THE FIRST DEBATE SEPTEMBER 26TH IS\nLIKELY TO CHANGE THINGS. BOTH CANDIDATES KNOW IF THEY\nLOSE THAT DEBATE THEY COULD VERY WELL LOSE THE ELECTION.\nSUMMING UP, NO PRIVACY ON THE PLANET ANYMORE.\nCOLIN POWELL IS EMBARRASSED. THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE VERY\nTIGHT. AND THAT'S THE MEMO.\nNOW FOR THE TOP STORY, REACTION WITH US HERE IN NEW\nYORK CITY, KARL ROVE. ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT THE\nHACKING THING? I MEAN, THIS COULD CHANGE\nEVERYTHING ABOUT POLITICS. COULD IT NOT?\n>> YEAH. I MEAN, THERE ARE THINGS\nTHAT YOU CAN DO TO PROTECT AGAINST IT AND I SUSPECT\nPOLITICIANS OVER TIME WILL AVAIL THEMSELVES WITH THOSE\nTOOLS. I THINK YOUR POINT WAS\nRIGHT. IN THIS WORLD TODAY YOU\nSHOULD HAVE NO EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY BECAUSE THE\nTECHNOLOGIES EXIST TO ALLOW ORDINARY PEOPLE TO INTRUDE\nINTO EVERYBODY'S LIFE. >> THAT MAKES IT VERY, VERY\nDIFFICULT FOR ANYBODY TO EVEN HAVE A PRIVATE\nCONVERSATION. AT ALL ABOUT ANYTHING.\n>> SURE. >> SHOULD LAWS NOW, NEW LAWS\nBE PUT INTO EFFECT TO STOP ALL THIS?\n>> I DON'T KNOW. I THINK WE NEED TO BE VERY\nCAREFUL ABOUT IT THERE ARE LAWS, FOR EXAMPLE, ON\nCONVERSATIONS IN SYMPTOM STATES IT'S LEGAL TO TAPE A\nCONVERSATION WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF A PARTY TO IT\nBUT IN A LOT OF STATES IT'S ILLEGAL TO TAPE A\nCONVERSATION WITHOUT ALL PARTIES.\n>> TWO PARTIES KNOWING. >> EXACTLY.\n>> I I JUST THINK THAT THIS IS A CHILLING TIME WITH THE\nTECHNOLOGY OVERWHELMING BASIC CIVILITY.\nTHINK ABOUT IT ALMOST EVERY AREA TECHNOLOGY IS\nOVERWHELMING CIVILITY. THERE IS NO HONOR ANYMORE.\nIT'S AMAZING. WE LIVE IN AN ERA IN WHICH\nWE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT OUR PRIVACY AND SO MUCH OF WHAT\nWE DO ON FACEBOOK AND TWITTER AND SNAP CHAT AND\nINSTAGRAM IS TO GIVE UP PART OF OUR PROBLEMS.\nSOMETHING VERY INTERESTING HERE.\nAMONG TRUMP VOTERS, PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPORTING DONALD\nTRUMP, 66% SAY THEY MAINLY VOTING AGAINST HILLARY\nCLINTON.

SO THE VOTERS HAVE A LEGITIMATE\nREASON TO ASK WHAT IS THE STATUS OF YOUR HEALTH AND YOU BEING\nABLE TO SERVE THE FULL TERM.

THE POLL WAS VERY REPUBLICAN\nHEAVY.

THIS IS ON A SHOW WE HAVEN'T\nSEEN BASED ON AN EXAMINATION WITH A DOCTOR WHO HAS NOT\nINDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED ANY OF THIS EXCEPT THE INTERVIEW HE HAD\nWITH NBC NEWS A FEW WEEKS AGO.

IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF\nEITHER CAMPAIGN ALLOWS THEIR DOCTOR TO TAKE QUESTIONS.\nONE THING THEY SAY HILLARY CLINTON SHOULD HAVE DONE WHEN IT\nCAME APPARENT ON SUNDAY SHE WAS SICKER THAN SHE MIGHT HAVE\nTHOUGHT, THAT IF SHE HAD LET HER DOCTOR SPEAK THEN, YOU KNOW,\nTHAT WOULD HAVE REASSURED PEOPLE IN A MORE FUNDAMENTAL WAY THAT,\nINDEED, JUST A CASE OF PNEUMONIA.\nLET'S MOVE ON.

THE COLIN POWELL E-MAILS CAME\nOUT ON DCLEAKS.COM WHICH MANY CYBER SECURITY EXPERTS HAVE\nCONCLUDED HAS TIES TO RUSSIAN ENTITIES.\nI SAY RUSSIAN ENTITIES BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES HAS NEVER SAID\nWHETHER IT BELIEVES THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT IS DOING THIS,\nWHETHER IT IS RUSSIAN PEOPLE ALTHOUGH THERE IS EVIDENCE IT IS\nGOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS IF YOU LOOK AT THE TIMES WHEN THE HACKS\nTAKE PLACE IT APPEARS TO BE DURING THE RUSSIAN WORK DAY.\nIN ANY EVENT THE QUESTION IS WHAT WILL THE UNITED STATES DO\nABOUT IT? WE HAVE BEEN TOLD BY SEVERAL\nOFFICIALS THERE ARE NO CRIMINAL CHARGES IMMINENT HERE.\nWE DON'T EXPECT CHARGES TO BE FILED AGAINST THE RUSSIAN\nENTITIES BUT WILL THE UNITED STATES PUBLICALLY SAY THAT THEY\nBELIEVE THE RUSSIANS ARE BEHIND IT?\nTHEY HAVE NEVER SAID IT. WILL THERE BE A SHAMING THING?\nWILL THERE BE SOME GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT EXCHANGE ABOUT THIS?\nTHAT'S THE LARGER QUESTION ABOUT WHICH THERE APPEARS TO BE NO\nANSWER NOW. >> AT THE SAME TIME, WE DO KNOW\nFROM AN INTERVIEW I DID AND FROM OTHER CONVERSATIONS THAT YOU\nHAVE HAD WITH JEH JOHNSON OF HOMELAND SECURITY SAID HE'S\nTASKING PEOPLE TO HELP WORK WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO MAKE SURE\nTHE ELECTION SYSTEM IS SAFE FROM HACKING AND FROM INTERFERENCE.\n>> THAT'S A VERY DIFFERENT QUESTION.\nOF COURSE IT APPEARS TO BE THAT THE GENERAL BELIEF IS THAT THE\nHACKS ARE INTENDED TO UNDERCUT CONFIDENCE IN THE U.S.\nELECTIONS.

CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT LOOKS\nAT THE NUMBERS. >> TWO CNN POLLS, TWO\nBATTLEGROUND STATES, DONALD TRUMP HAS MOMENTUM FOR\nPRESIDENT. IN THE STATE OF OHIO, NO\nREPUBLICAN WINS WITHOUT IT. DONALD TRUMP MUST WIN OHIO, AT\nTHE MOMENT, HE'S UP FIVE POINTS, 46% TO 41% FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHE THIRD-PARTY CANDIDATES GETTING A COMBINED TEN.\nWHY IS THIS HAPPENING? HERE'S ONE REASON, IN OTHER\nBATTLEGROUND STATES HILLARY CLINTON HAS BENEFITED BY WINNING\nAMONG COLLEGE-EDUCATED VOTERS. IN OHIO,\nDONALD TRUMP HAS A LEAD AND HE'S TROUNCING HILLARY CLINTON AMONG\nWHITE CLASS WORKING VOTERS. HILLARY CLINTON IS LOSING THESE\nVOTERS. IT IS A PLUS FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nHILLARY CLINTON NEEDS A GENDER GAP AND NEEDS TO WIN IT UP BIG\nWITH WOMEN VOTERS BECAUSE THE REPUBLICAN USUALLY WINS AMONG\nMEN. ONLY A TWO-POINT ADVANTAGE FOR\nSECRETARY CLINTON IN THIS OHIO POLL WITH WOMEN.\nTHAT'S A PROBLEM FOR HER. LET'S MOVE SOUTH TO THE BIGGEST\nBATTLEGROUND IN TERMS OF ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES, 29,\nFLORIDA, AND THE NUMBERS LOOK SIMILAR.\nTHIS ONE'S A LITTLE BIT TIGHTER INSIDE THE MARGIN OF ERROR, 44%\n-- 37% FOR TRUMP, AND 44 FOR CLINTON.\nTHIS IS THE CLOSEST RACE BETWEEN SINCE 2012 BETWEEN OBAMA AND\nROMNEY. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THIS\nEDUCATION GAP WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER BATTLEGROUND STATES,\nNOT LIKE HERE IN FLORIDA. DONALD TRUMP WINNING AMONG WHITE\nCOLLEGE GRADUATES AND TROUNCING WHITE COLLEGE EDUCATED VOTERS.\nONE OTHER POINT, HILLARY CLINTON IS THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE\nTRYING TO SUCCEED A TWO-TERM DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT.\nIF THE PRESIDENT'S DISAPPROVAL RATING IS A MAJORITY AS IT IS IN\nOHIO AND FLORIDA -- THEY DON'T LIKE THE PRESIDENT SO MUCH.\nHE IS UNDER WATER IN POLITICS, IN OTHER STATES WE'VE\nSEEN THE PRESIDENT ABOVE 50%, SHE DOES BETTER SO THE OBAMA\nMATTERS, AS WELL. SO POLLS IN OHIO, HOW DO THEY\nEFFECT THE ELECTORAL MAP, IF THE ELECTION WERE TODAY, SECRETARY\nCLINTON WOULD WIN. DARK BLUE IS SOLID DEMOCRAT.\nSO IF DONALD TRUMP WON FLORIDA AND OHIO, BASED ON THOSE NEW\nPOLLS, THERE'S NEW POLL SHOWING HIM WINNING IN NEVADA, EVEN THAT\nWOULD NOT BE ENOUGH FOR DONALD TRUMP TO WIN THE UPON\nPRESIDENCY, HE HAS TO TURN ONE OF THOSE BLUE STATES RED.\nVIRGINIA, MICHIGAN, PENNSYLVANIA, WATCH IF\nWE SEE MORE STATE POLLING. LOOK FOR THOSE GENDER NUMBERS.\nLOOK FOR THOSE EDUCATION NUMBERS.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS MOMENTUM, NOT QUITE ENOUGH.\n>> JOHN KING, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT.\nI WANT TO BRING IN OUR CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST, GLORIA\nBORGER, AND SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST, DAVID GERGEN.\nAND MARK PRESIDENT -- MARK PRESTON.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYONE. HOW WORRIED, GLORIA, SHOULD\nHILLARY CLINTON BE ABOUT THESE BATTLEGROUND NUMBERS?\n>> WORRIED. AND I THINK THEY ARE WORRIED\nABOUT THEM. SHE HAD A BIG BOUNCE COMING OUT\nOF HER CONVENTION. IT'S CLEAR EVAPORATED MORE OR\nLESS, AND BATTLEGROUND STATES TEND TO RISE AND FALL TOGETHER\nAND SHE'S HAVING A LITTLE PROBLEM WITH THEM RIGHT NOW.\nI WAS LOOKING AT SOME OF THE INTERNALS IN THE POLL NUMBERS\nJOHN WAS TALKING ABOUT IN FLORIDA AND OHIO.\nWHAT STRUCK ME WAS HOW BEHIND SHE WAS COMPARED TO BARACK OBAMA\nIN 2012 WITH YOUNGER VOTERS. SHE'S 13 POINTS BEHIND WHERE HE\nWAS IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA. THAT'S A LOT.\n>> AND THAT HELPED HIM WIN. >> IT REALLY HELPED HIM WIN.\nSHE NEEDS TO GET BERNIE SANDERS OUT THERE ON THE TRAIL, HELPING\nHER WITH THOSE YOUNGER VOTERS. THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY\nIMPORTANT TO HER. >> ON THE DOUBLE.\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NATIONAL POLLS, MARK, AND CNN'S POLL\nSHOWING OHIO AND FLORIDA TRUMP LEADS, SHE'S LOST A LOT OF\nGROUND SINCE THE CONVENTION. DONALD TRUMP, HE CLEARLY HAS THE\nMOMENTUM NOW. >> WELL, YES AND NOW.\nHE HAS THE MOMENTUM WHERE HE HAS KIND OF STABILIZED WHERE HE IS\nAT. SHE HAS REALLY DROPPED.\n SHE WAS UP EIGHT COMING UP OUT OF THE CONVENTION NATIONALLY,\nAND THAT TRACKED WITH THE BATTLEGROUND STATES BUT WHAT\nWE'RE SEEING AND NOT ONLY IN OUR TWO POLLS, IN IOWA AND NEVADA,\nTHAT ARE NOT GOOD AT ALL FOR HILLARY CLINTON AT THIS POINT,\nIT'S ALL TRENDING RIGHT NOW, AND WHILE THERE'S 55 DAYS LEFT, AND\nCLEARLY WHAT WE SAW FROM JOHN RIGHT THERE, SHE WOULD WIN TODAY\nGIVEN THE ELECTORAL MAP, THE TREND IS NOT GOING HER WAY.\n>> ARE WE SEEING PEOPLE WHO YOU KNOW WERE MAYBE A LITTLE BIT\nADVERSE TO DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T SO SURE ABOUT HIM\nAND NOW HE'S SORT OF APPEARS TO HAVE STABILIZED WITH THIS NEW\nTEAM, THAT THESE ARE REPUBLICANS WHO ARE COMING ON BOARD SAYING\nOKAY MAYBE WE CAN -- >> I THINK WE'RE SEEING A\nNATURAL COMING TOGETHER OF A REPUBLICAN PARTY THAT HAS BEEN\nINCREDIBLY FRACTURED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE YEAR.\n>> DAVID, CLINTON HAS HAD A ROUGH FEW WEEKS SINCE TRUMP\nCHANGED HIS CAMPAIGN TEAM. HE'S BEEN POUNDING HER ON THE\nFOUNDATION, THE E-MAILS, LARGELY AVOIDING MAKING MAJOR MISTAKES\nAND SHE HAD THIS DEPLORABLES COMMENT AND THE PNEUMONIA\nEPISODE. WHAT DOES SHE NEED TO DO TO TURN\nTHIS AROUND? AND CAN SHE?\n>> WIN THE FIRST DEBATE. EVERYTHING IS GOING TO COME TO\nTHAT DEBATE. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME\nBACK-AND-FORTH'ING OVER THE NEXT 12 DAYS OR SO.\nTHAT FIRST DEBATE BECOMES ALL IMPORTANT.\nA COUPLE THINGS, DON. IN THE BACKGROUND HERE, IS THAT\nAS YOU SAY, HE'S RUNNING A MUCH MORE DISCIPLINED AND SMARTER\nCAMPAIGN, MORE INTERESTING EVENTS THAN WHAT HE'S HAD IN THE\nPAST, AND I THINK THAT HAS HELPED HIM.\nBUT ALSO, THIS -- BOTH CANDIDATES HAVE ALLOWED THIS\nCAMPAIGN TO DRIFT OVER AND CENTER ON THE QUESTION AMONG THE\nPOPULOUS, WHICH ONE DO YOU TRUST MORE?\nWHICH ONE DO YOU LIKE MORE AND THAT'S THE BASIS ON WHICH YOU'RE\nGOING TO VOTE. SHE COULD EASILY LOSE THAT\nQUESTION. WHAT SHE CAN WIN ON IS WHO IS\nGOING TO DO MORE FOR THE COUNTRY WHO HAS AN AGENDA FOR THE FUTURE\nBOTH HOME AND ABROAD THAT'S GOING TO MAKE\nYOU MORE SAFER AND PROSPEROUS. SHE HAS A BETTER CHANCE OF\nWINNING THAT ON THE SUBSTANCE THAN ON THE LIKABILITY\nSITUATION. >> DONALD TRUMP HAD A RALLY AND\nTALKED ABOUT CLINTON'S HEALTH. LISTEN TO THIS.\n>> DO YOU THINK THIS IS EASY? OH, YOU THINK THIS IS SO EASY?\nIN THIS BEAUTIFUL ROOM THAT'S 122 DEGREES?\nIT IS HOT AND IT'S ALWAYS HOT WHEN I PERFORM BECAUSE THE\nCROWDS ARE SO BIG. I DON'T KNOW, FOLKS.\nYOU THINK HILLARY WOULD BE ABLE TO STAND UP HERE FOR AN HOUR AND\nDO THIS? I DON'T KNOW.\nI DON'T KNOW. I DON'T THINK SO.\nI DON'T THINK SO. >> NOT A GOOD LOOK, GLORIA?\n>> NOT A GOOD LOOK. FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T THINK IT'S\nEVER A GREAT IDEA TO COMPLAIN TO THE VOTERS HOW TOUGH YOUR JOB\nIS WHEN YOU RUN FOR PRESIDENT, I THINK THAT'S WHAT HE WAS\nDOING. SAYING KIND OF LIKE I DON'T NEED\nTHIS, BUT IT'S 100 DEGREES AND THIS IS REALLY HARD ON ME.\n>> HE'S ACTUALLY SAID I DON'T",

HILLARY CLINTON CAME OUT OF THE\nCONVENTION EIGHT POINTS UP NATI\nNATIONALLY. WE HAD A CNN POLL THAT SHOWED\nTHAT HAD E VAP WAITED AND OF COURSE THAT IS LAGGING IN THE\nSTATE POLLS.

THAT IS NOT GOOD FOR HER.\nIN THE STATE OF FLORIDA, SHE'S ONLY UP SIX POINTS.\nLET'S TAKE A STEP BACK THOUGH. THE FACT IS IF THE ELECTION WERE\nHELD TODAY, SHE WOULD STILL WIN. SHE DOES NOT NEED TO WIN FLORIDA\nAND OHIO AND THE REASON BEING IS DEMOCRATS HAVE DONE WELL IN THE\nSTATES OUT WEST. >> OKAY.\nSO SHE'S EXPECTED TO BE BACK ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL TOMORROW, OF\nCOURSE SHE SUFFERED THIS BOUT AND IS STILL SUFFERING WITH\nPNEUMONIA. SHE RELEASED NEW MEDICAL\nINFORMATION TODAY. IS IT FAIR TO SAY WE NOW HAVE\nMORE INFORMATION ON HILLARY CLINTON AS A -- YOU KNOW IN\nREGARDS TO MEDICAL RECORDS AND TAXES THAN WE DO ON DONALD\nTRUMP? >> WE DO UNTIL WE SEE WHAT --\nWHAT DONALD TRUMP RELEASES TOMORROW.\nBUT LOOK, THE BOTTOM LINE IS NEITHER CANDIDATE IS EXPECTED TO\nMEET THE MCCAIN STANDARDS CERTAINLY ON HEALTH RECORDS.\nWE'RE -- YOU KNOW THIS PRISON OF WAR WHO HAD CANCER, ALLOWED\nREPORTERS IN AND INCLUDING S SANJAY GUPTA TO LOOK AT THE\nHISTORY, NEITHER CANDIDATE IS ME, DON?\n>> YES, THE WORLD IS A DIFFERENT",

              "text": ">>> TWO MONTHS UNTIL ELECTION\nDAY, AND RECENT POLLS SHOW DONALD TRUMP LEADING IN OHIO AND\nFLORIDA. CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT LOOKS\nAT THE NUMBERS. >> TWO CNN POLLS, TWO\nBATTLEGROUND STATES, DONALD TRUMP HAS MOMENTUM FOR\nPRESIDENT. IN THE STATE OF OHIO, NO\nREPUBLICAN WINS WITHOUT IT. DONALD TRUMP MUST WIN OHIO, AT\nTHE MOMENT, HE'S UP FIVE POINTS, 46% TO 41% FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHE THIRD-PARTY CANDIDATES GETTING A COMBINED TEN.\nWHY IS THIS HAPPENING? HERE'S ONE REASON, IN OTHER\nBATTLEGROUND STATES HILLARY CLINTON HAS BENEFITED BY WINNING\nAMONG COLLEGE-EDUCATED VOTERS. DONALD TRUMP HAS A LEAD AND HE'S\nTROUNSING HILLARY CLINTON AMONG WHITE CLASS WORKING VOTERS.\nONE INTERESTING POINT IN OHIO, HILLARY CLINTON NEEDS A GENDER\nGAP AND NEEDS TO WIN IT UP BIG WITH WOMEN VOTERS BECAUSE THE\nREPUBLICAN USUALLY WINS AMONG MEN.\nONLY A TWO-POINT ADVANTAGE FOR SECRETARY CLINTON IN THIS OHIO\nPOLL, THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR HER. LET'S MOVE SOUTH TO THE BIGGEST\nBATTLEGROUND IN TERMS OF ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES, 29,\nFLORIDA, AND THE NUMBERS LOOK SIMILAR.\nTHIS ONE'S A LITTLE BIT TIGHTER INSIDE THE MARGIN OF ERROR, 44%\nFOR TRUMP AND 47% FOR CLINTON. THIS IS THE CLOSEST RACE BETWEEN\nOBAMA AND ROMNEY AND IF YOU LOOK AT THIS EDUCATION GAP WE'VE SEEN\nIN OTHER BATTLEGROUND STATES, NOT LIKE HERE IN FLORIDA.\nDONALD TRUMP WINNING AMONG WHITE COLLEGE GRADUATES AND TROUNCING\nWHITE COLLEGE EDUCATED VOTERS. ONE OTHER POINT, HILLARY CLINTON\nIS THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE TRYING TO SUCCEED A TWO-TERM\nDEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT. IF THE PRESIDENT'S DISAPPROVAL\nRATING IS LIKE OHIO AND AUTHORIZE, HE'S UNDER WATER IN\nPOLITICS, IN OTHER STATES WE'VE SEEN THE PRESIDENT ABOVE 50%,\nSHE DOES BETTER SO THE OBAMA MATTERS, AS WELL.\nSO POLLS IN OHIO, HOW DO THEY EFFECT THE ELECTORAL MAP, IF THE\nELECTION WERE TODAY, SECRETARY CLINTON WOULD WIN.\nDARK BLUE IS SOLID DEMOCRAT. SO IF DONALD TRUMP WON FLORIDA\nAND OHIO, BASED ON THOSE NEW POLLS, THERE'S NEW POLL SHOWING\nHIM WINNING IN NEVADA, EVEN THAT WOULD NOT BE ENOUGH FOR DONALD\nTRUMP TO WIN THE UPON PRESIDENCY, HE HAS TO TURN ONE\nOF THOSE BLUE STATES RED. MICHIGAN, PENNSYLVANIA, WATCH IF\nB WE SEE MORE STATEPOLLING.\nLOOK FOR THOSE GENDER NUMBERS. DONALD TRUMP HAS MOMENTUM, NOT\nQUITE ENOUGH. >> JOHN KING, THANK YOU VERY\nMUCH FOR THAT. I WANT TO BRING IN OUR CHIEF\nPOLITICAL ANALYST, GLORIA BORGER, AND SENIOR POLITICAL\nANALYST, DAVID GERGIN. THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYONE.\nHOW WORRIED, GLORIA, SHOULD HILLARY CLINTON BE ABOUT THESE\nBATTLEGROUND NUMBERS? >> WORRIED.\nAND I THINK THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT THEM.\nSHE HAD A BIG BOUNCE COMING OUT OF HER CONVENTION.\nIT'S CLEAR EVAPORATED MORE OR LESS, AND BATTLEGROUND STATES\nTEND TO RISE AND FALL TOGETHER AND SHE'S HAVING A LITTLE\nPROBLEM WITH THEM RIGHT NOW. I WAS LOOKING AT SOME OF THE\nINTERNALS IN THE POLL NUMBERS JOHN WAS TALKING ABOUT IN\nFLORIDA AND OHIO. WHAT STRUCK ME WAS HOW BEHIND\nSHE WAS COMPARED TO BARACK OBAMA WITH YOUNGER VOTERS.\nSHE'S 13 POINTS BEHIND WHERE HE WAS IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA.\nTHAT'S A LOT. >> AND THAT HELPED HIM WIN.\n>> IT REALLY HELPED HIM WIN. SHE NEEDS TO GET BERNIE SANDERS\nOUT THERE ON THE TRAIL, HELPING HER WITH THOSE YOUNGER VOTERS.\n>> ON THE DOUBLE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NATIONAL\nPOLLS, MARK, AND CNN'S POLL SHOWING OHIO AND FLORIDA TRUMP\nLEADS, SHE'LOST A LOT OF GROUND. SHE'S KIND OF STABILIZED WHERE\nHE'S AT. SHE HAS REALLY DROPPED.\n>> SHE WAS UP EIGHT COMING UP OUT OF THE CONVENTION\nNATIONALLY, AND THAT TRACKED WITH THE BATTLEGROUND STATES BUT\nWHAT WE'RE SEEING AND NOT ONLY IN OUR TWO POLLS, IN IOWA AND\nNEVADA, THAT ARE NOT GOOD AT ALL FOR HILLARY CLINTON AT THIS\nPOINT, IT'S ALL TRENDING RIGHT NOW, AND WHILE THERE'S 55 DAYS\nLEFT, AND CLEARLY WHAT WE SAW FROM JOHN RIGHT THERE, SHE WOULD\nWIN TODAY GIVEN THE ELECTORAL MAP, THE TREND IS NOT GOING HER\nWAY. >> ARE WE SEEING PEOPLE WHO YOU\nKNOW WERE MAYBE A LITTLE BIT ADVERSE TO DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE\nTHEY WEREN'T SO SURE ABOUT HIM AND NOW HE'S SORT OF APPEARS TO\nHAVE STABILIZED WITH THIS NEW TEAM, THAT THESE ARE REPUBLICANS\nWHO ARE COMING ON BOARD SAYING OKAY MAYBE WE CAN --\n>> I THINK WE'RE SEEING A NATURAL COMING TOGETHER OF A\nREPUBLICAN PARTY THAT HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY FRACTURED THROUGHOUT\nTHE WHOLE YEAR. >> DAVID, CLINTON HAS HAD A\nROUGH FEW WEEKS SINCE TRUMP CHANGED HIS CAMPAIGN TEAM.\nHE'S BEEN POUNDING HER ON THE FOUNDATION, THE E-MAILS, LARGELY\nAVOIDING MAKING MAJOR MISTAKES AND SHE HAD THIS DEPLORABLES\nCOMMENT AND THE PNEUMONIA EPI\nEPISODE, WHAT AND CAN SHE DO TO TURN THIS AROUND?\n>> WIN THE FIRST DEBATE. EVERYTHING IS GOING TO COME TO\nTHAT DEBATE. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME BACK\nAND FORTHING OVER THE NEXT 12 DAYS OR SO.\nTHAT FIRST DEBATE BECOMES ALL IMPORTANT.\nIN THE BACKGROUND HERE, IS THAT AS YOU SAY, HE'S RUNNING A MUCH\nMORE DISCIPLINED AND SMARTER CAMPAIGN, MORE INTERESTING\nEVENTS THAN WHAT HE'S HAD IN THE PAST, AND I THINK THAT HAS\nHELPED HIM. BUT ALSO, THIS -- BOTH\nCANDIDATES HAVE ALLOWED THIS CAMPAIGN TO DRIFT OVER AND\nCENTER ON THE QUESTION AMONG THE POPULOUS, WHICH ONE DO YOU TRUST\nMORE? WHICH ONE DO YOU LIKE MORE AND\nTHAT'S THE BASIS ON WHICH YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE.\nSHE COULD EASILY LOSE THAT QUESTION.\nWHAT SHE CAN WIN ON IS WHO IS GOING TO DO MORE FOR THE COUNTRY\nAND WHO HAS AN AGENDA AT HOME",

NOBODY IS SAYING THAT, BUT I\nTHINK THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF QUESTIONS.\nDID DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO HAVE EVERY SINGLE MEDICAL\nRECORD. SOME OF THAT PROBABLY ISN'T\nRELEVANT AND IT'S PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE TO BE KEPT PRIVATE\nBUT I THINK IF THE QUESTION IS, IS THIS PERSON FIT TO LEAD FROM\nA HEALTH STANDPOINT? WHAT ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT\nSHOULD BE ASKED A THAT POINT, THE RESULTS, THE DATA I THINK\nTHE PUBLIC'S ENTITLED TO. LOOK, I THINK THAT MAYBE SOME OF\nTHAT CAME OUT OF THIS. I DON'T KNOW STILL.\nWE'LL SEE WHEN THE SHOW FINALLY AIRS, BUT IT'S HARD TO GET THE\nCOMPLETE PICTURE I THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE.\n>> AT A MINIMUM I ASSUME HIS BLOOD PRESSURE, CHOLESTEROL\nLEVELS, STUFF LIKE THAT. >> RIGHT.\n>> HIS HEIGHT, HIS WEIGHT. AND THE ANALYSIS FROM HIS\nDOCTOR, DR. BORNSTEIN. SANJAY, STAND BY.\nSARA, STAND BY AS WELL. QUESTIONS ABOUT TRUMP AND\nCLINTON'S MEDICAL RECORDS POINT TO A BROADER CONCERN ABOUT A\nLACK OF TRANSPARENCY BY THE CAMPAIGNS AND THE CANDIDATES.\nLET'S DISCUSS THAT AND MORE WITH OUR POLITICAL ANALYST DAVID\nGREGORY, AUTHOR OF \"HOW'S YOUR FAITH\" AN IMPORTANT BOOK JUST\nOUT IN PAPERBACK RIGHT NOW. ALSO JOINING US, CAROL LEE,\nWHITE HOUSE REPORTER FOR THE \"WALL STREET JOURNAL.\"\nCNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR RYAN LIZZA, HE'S THE WASHINGTON KORNT\nFOR THE \"NEW YORKER\" MAGAZINE. DAVID, TALK A LITTLE ABOUT WHAT\nWE ANTICIPATED. EARLIER THIS MORNING, WEREN'T\nGOING TO GET MUCH DURING THE \"DR. OZ SHOW\" GETTING.\nLISTENING TO DR. GUPTA, NOT WHAT JOHN McCAIN DID WHEN HE LET\nMEDICAL CORRESPONDENTS INCLUDING DR. GUPTA SPEND HOURS WITH HIS\nRECORD AND TALKING TO PHYSICIANS?\n>> AN EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCE BECAUSE HE HAD CANCER, MELANOMA\nAND ALLOWED A THOROUGH REVIEW. SOMETHING SPECIFIC TO CANCER\nWHICH COULD END HIS LIFE AND THAT MADE SENSE.\nTHERE'S A BASIC FOUNDATION OF TRANSPARENCY REQUIRED OF ANY\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE THAT BOTH CANDIDATES OUGHT TO ADHERE TO.\nA REALITY SHOW NATURE, WHICH WE'VE COME TO EXPECT OF DONALD\nTRUMP, IN TERMS OF THESE KINDS OF SLOW REVEALS.\nI THINK SOME OF IT IS JUST SILLY.\nYOU KNOW, THERE SHOULD BE A THOROUGH SCRUBBING OF THIS KIND\nOF INFORMATION. THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW.\nIT IS ALSO TRUE OF HILLARY CLINTON, WHO SHOULD BE MORE\nTRANSPARENT ABOUT HER RECORDS, AND ABOUT LEVELING WITH HER\nPRESS CORPS IF SHE GETS DIAGNOSED WITH SOMETHING LIKE\nPNEUMONIA. >> YES.\nAND, CAROL, THE CAMPAIGN MANAGER FOR DONALD TRUMP, KELLYANNE\nCONWAY, SHE SAID THIS, I'M QUOTING.\nI DON'T KNOW WHY WE NEED SUCH EXTENSIVE MEDICAL REPORTING WHEN\nWE ALL HAVE A RIGHT TO PRIVACY. SO WHEN YOU HEAR THAT, WHEN I\nHEAR THAT, AS REPORTERS, AS JOURNALISTS WE SAY, IF YOU'RE\nRUNNING FOR PRESIDENT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THAT COMPLETE\nRIGHT TO PRIVACY. >> IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT\nSTANDARD. IF YOU'RE RETURNING FOR\nPRESIDENT YOU HAVE, YOU DON'T HAVE A RIGHT TO PRIVACY ON\nCERTAIN ISSUES. THERE ARE THINGS THAT\nTRADITIONALLY THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW.\nTHEY NEED TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR HEALTH.\nTHEY TRADITIONALLY KNOW ABOUT YOUR TAXES.\nAND WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THIS ELECTION CYCLE IS, AN EROSION OF\nTHESE LONGTIME NORMS ON BOTH SIDES.\nWHETHER HEALTH RECORDS OR TAXES OR PRESS ACCESS.\nAND IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT IF IT CONTINUES IN THIS WAY, THAT\nYOU'RE EVER GOING TO REALLY GET THAT BACK.\n>> BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW, RYAN, YOU WANT A RIGHT TO PRIVACY,\nDON'T RUN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\n>> I WAS LITERALLY GOING TO SAY THAT EXACT SAME THING.\n>> ALL OF US, PRIVATE CITIZENS HAVE A RIGHT TO PRIVACY.\nIF YOU WANT TO BE THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD, THE MOST\nIMPORTANT POSITION IN THE WORLD, THE AMERICAN PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT\nTO KNOW IF YOU'RE HEALTHY, NO THE HEALTHY, TAXES, ALL THAT.\n>> YOU VALUE PRIVACY, RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IS NOT THE\nBUSINESS TO BE IN. SHOULDN'T BE IN THE PUBLIC EYE\nAT ALL, SHOULDN'T HAVE YOUR OWN REALITY TV SHOW.\nI'M A LITTLE SURPRISED SHE SAID THAT.\nI THINK AT THE MINIMUM, TRUMP NEEDS TO MATCH WHAT CLINTON HAS\nREVEALED. SHE PUT OUT A TWO-PAGE LETTER\nLAST YEAR. NOT THE MOST THOROUGH DOCUMENT\nIN THE WORLD, BUT IT HAD ALL OF THE MEDICATIONS SHE'S TAKING.\n2 HAD THE HISTORY OF HER BLOOD CLOT AND HER CONCUSSION AND\nSEASONAL ALLERGIES AND GAVE US --\n>> HISTORY OF DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS IN HER LEGS.\n>> YES. EXACTLY.\nAND THE MOST RECENT PHYSICAL. TRUMP HASN'T DONE SOME SIMILAR.\nWE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED ON DR. OZ TODAY.\nSOUNDS A LITTLE MORE FROM THE REPORT LIKE A REALITY TV\nPUBLICITY STUNT THAN A SERIOUS MEDICAL EVALUATION WITH LOTS OF\nDETAILED INFORMATION. WE'LL HAVE TO SEE.\n>> THE POINT IS, YOU WANT DATA. RIGHT?\nYOU WANT TO HAVE -- CNN WOULD LIKE THIS INFORMATION.\nHAVE DR. GUPTA TO SAY WHAT DOES IT TELL YOU ABOUT RISK FACTORS\nAND OTHER THINGS ABOUT HISTORY THAT WOULD BE RELEVANT WHETHER\nHE COULD SERVE CAPABLY AT PRESIDENT.\n>> THIS PAIR IS THE OLDEST PAIR OF PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES --\n>> HE'S 70, NEXT MONTH SHE'LL BE 69.\n>> RIGHT. THIS ISN'T LIKE, A COUPLE OF\nSPRING CHICKENS. >> NO.\nONE OF THE OTHER THINGS -- >> MAKES THIS MUCH MORE\nIMPORTANT. >> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S\nCONCERNING, YOU TALKED ABOUT. CLINTON RELEASED LAST YEAR AND\nTRUMP WILL MATCH THAT. A RACE TO THE BOTTOM, I'LL DO\nTHE MINIMUM, I'LL DO THE MINIMUM.\nTRADITIONALLY IT'S INFORMATION THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN GIVEN TO THE\nPUBLIC. >> HOW MUCH DAMP AGE WAS DONE T\nHER IN THE DELAY OF RELEASING THE NEWS SHE HAD PNEUMONIA?\n>> A PROBLEM. MUCH MORE DEFINING THAN THE\nBASKET OF DEPLORABLES COMMENT. THIS IS THE FUNDAMENTAL\nCRITICISM OF HER. A PENCHANT FOR SECRECY, MAYBE\nDECEPTION SHE'S TOO SECRETIVE ABOUT.\nSHE REINFORCES IT TIME AFTER TIME.\nTHERE'S NO REASON FOR IT. SHE SAYS COMPARE ME TO MY\nALTERNATIVE. THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT\nALTERNATIVE. DONALD TRUMP NOT RELEASING TAXES\nIS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE, BUT THE COMPARISON IS IS REASONABLE,\nPRECEDENT, HISTORIC. THEY SHOULD BOTH BE HELD TO\nTHIS. I AGREE WITH YOU, CAROL.\nMEMBERS OF THE PRESS. WE WANT ULTIMATE ACCESS.\nTHE PUBLIC SHOULD GET AS MUCH ACCESS AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE\nKNOWLEDGE IS IMPORTANT HERE. >> CAROL, WHEN WE GET THE\nCRITICISM, AS WE DO WHEN WE PRESS FOR THESE DETAILS AND WANT\nIF RIGHT AWAY, HER SUPPORTERS COME, SAY, BIG ISSUES OUT THERE.\nWHY AREN'T YOU FOCUSING ON ON THOSE?\nWHY FOCUS ON THE FEW HOURS, DELAY IN THE RELEASE OF THE WORD\n\"PNEUMONIA\"? >> THESE THINGS MATTER TOP WHAT\nYOU'RE SAYING ABOUT HER, THE PERCEPTION ARE HERE ADHERING TO\nSECRECY AND ON DONALD TRUMP SIDE YOU SEE POLLS ARE SHOWING VOTERS\nDO CARE ABOUT RELEASING YOUR TAX RETURNS.\nI THINK WHAT'S GOING TO MATTER IS WHETHER THE CANDIDATES PAY AT\nTHE POLLS FOR THE APPROACH THEY'VE TAKEN, AND THAT'S NOT\nCLEAR THEY WILL. >> THE POLLS COMING--\n>> OVERWHELMING. >> SHOW DONALD TRUMP REALLY\nCATCHING UP PRETTY DRAMATICALLY. THERE'S A NEW BLOOMBERG POLL\nTHAT JUST CAME OUT IN OHIO. THE KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE OF\nOHIO. LOOK AT THIS.\nTRUMP AT 44%. CLINTON, 39%.\nFIVE-POINT LEAD AND THEN YOU GET INTO GARY JOHNSON, THE\nLIBERTARIAN CANDIDATE, AND JILL STEIN.\nTHIS IS -- IN OHIO, AND THEN A MONMOUTH UNIVERSITY POLL IN\nNEVADA RIGHT NOW. TRUMP IS WINNING THERE 44% TO\n42%. THESE ARE NUMBERS THAT CLEARLY\nARE DISTURBING TO THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN.\n>> YEAH. LOOK, THESE BATTLEGROUNDS LIKE\nIOWA, NEVADA AND OHIO, DEMOGRAPHICALLY A LITTLE BETTER\nFOR TRUMP TIGHTENED QUITE A BIT. THE OVERALL PICTURE, NINE-POINT\nLEAD FOR CLINTON DOWN TO A 4.5 LEAD, DEPENDING ON THE POLL YOU\nLOOK AT. THAT'S CONCERNING.\nHE'S DOING SOMETHING RIGHT OVER THIS LAST MONTH.\nMAYBE IT'S THE TRADITIONAL POSTCONVENTION BOUNCE\nDISSIPATING AND THIS RACE IS SETTLING INTO A SLIM BUT\nCOMFORTABLE LEAD FOR HILLARY, BUT THEY NEED TO BE A LITTLE BIT\nWORRIED BY THE, NOT JUST THE NATIONAL POLLS NOW BUT NOW THESE\nIMPORTANT SWING STATES, YOU AND I, WE'VE ALL COVERED -- NATIONAL\nPOLLS ARE IMPORTANT. INTERESTING.\nTHE KEY BATTLEGROUND STATES, OHIO, FLORIDA, SOME OF THESE\nOTHER KEY BATTLEGROUNDS STATES, WHETHER VIRGINIA, NORTH\nCAROLINA, PENNSYLVANIA. THAT'S WHERE THIS BATTLE IS\nGOING TO BE WON AND LOST. >> PARTICULARLY IF YOU LOOK, HIS\nBREAD AND BUTTER, MALE VOTERS. VOTERS, WHITE VOTERS WITHOUT A\nCOLLEGE DEGREE. HE'S, HE HAS A HUGE ADVANTAGE\nOVER HILLARY CLINTON AMONG THOSE VOTERS WHO ARE GOING TO BE IN\nSTATES LIKE OHIO. THAT RUST BELT IS REALLY WHERE\nHE'S GOING TO MAKE HIS GAINS IF HE'S GOING TO DO IT AND ALSO\nPOLITICAL MALPRACTICE ON HER PART.\nSHE HAS LOST SOME OF THAT ADVANTAGE WHEN HE'S GOTTEN A BIT\nMORE DISCIPLINED ON THE TRAIL, SHE'S MADE MISTAKES AND\nSELF-INFLICTED WOUNDS AND WE SEE IT TIGHTENING.\nCAN'T DENY IT AND A LOT OF DEMOCRATS ARE WORRIED, HOW DID\nTHIS GUESS SO CLOSE, POINTING TO THEIR CANDIDATE AND HER TEAM.\n>> FINAL THOUGHTS? >> IF YOU IN TERMS OF THE MAP,\nTHEY BELIEVE PENNSYLVANIA IS NECESSARILY THE FIREWALL, TRUMP\nCAN PICK UP A BUNCH OF STATES AND SHE HAS TO HOLD\nPENNSYLVANIA. YOU'VE SEEN BILL CLINTON THERE,\nJOE BLIDEN. >> THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES IN PENNSYLVANIA, OF ALL PLACES, SHOULD BE A RELATIVELY\nEASY LOCK FOR THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE BUT THEY CONSIDER IT\nPROBLEMATIC RIGHT NOW. GUYS, THANKS VERY, VERY MUCH.\n>>> COMING UP, DONALD TRUMP AND",

I'M BRIT HUME AND THIS IS\n\"ON THE RECORD.\" BOTH DONALD TRUMP AND\nHILLARY CLINTON RELEASING MEDICAL RECORDS TODAY.\nTHE REAL CLEAR AVERAGE OF NATIONAL POLLS TONIGHT SHOWS\nHILLARY CLINTON WITH A 2.3 POINT LEAD.\nHER AVERAGE IS HELPED BY A NEW QUINNIPIAC POLL SHOWING\nA 5 POINT LEAD IN A TWO-WAY RACE 4 POINT LEAD IN FOUR\nWAY RACE. THAT EXPLAINS WHY HER LEAD\nHAS SLIPPED. THERE IS GOOD NEWS FOR\nDONALD TRUMP IN COUPLE OF KEY STATES.\nBLOOMBERG POLITICS POLL OF LIKELY VOTERS IN OHIO GIVES\nHIM A 5 POINT LEAD, 48 TO 43%.\nAND A MONMOUTH POLL OUT IN NEVADA 2 POINT LEAD NOT A\nBIG LEAD BUT BIG IMPROVEMENT BACK IN JULY WHEN THE SAME\nPOLLSTER SHOWED MRS. CLINTON WITH A 4 POINT LEAD.\nBOTH THESE STATES HAVE CAPTURED SENTIMENT SINCE\nTHIS PAST WEEKEND, WHICH WAS TO SAY THE LEAST EVENTFUL.\nFOR SOME THOUGHTS ON ALL THIS NOW, WE TURN TO BYRON\nYORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT OF \"THE\nWASHINGTON EXAMINER\" AND MOLLY HEMINGWAY THE ONLINE\nPUBLICATION THE FEDERALIST. MOLLY, AS YOU LOOK AT ALL OF\nTHIS, WHERE DOES THE RACE SEEM TO YOU TO BE.\n>> I THINK WHAT THESE POLLS SHOW IS THAT AMERICANS HAVE\nKNOWN SINCE HILLARY CLINTON RAN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2008\nSHE IS A TERRIFICALLY AWFUL CANDIDATE.\nSHE IS STRUGGLING EVEN WITH ALL THE HELP SHE IS GETTING\nFROM THE POLITICAL AND MEDIA ESTABLISHMENT WHO ARE TRYING\nTO SORT OF DRAG HER ACROSS THE FINISH LINE.\nTHE UNDERLYING DYNAMIC WE HAVE SEEN.\n>> WHEN YOU SAY SHE IS AN AWFUL CANDIDATE, YOU MEAN AN\nAWFUL CANDIDATE FOR THE OFFICE OR AN AWFUL\nCAMPAIGNER OR BOTH. >> JUST AS A CAMPAIGNER.\nSHE HAS A LOT OF TROUBLE. AND SHE CAN'T EVEN PUT AWAY\nA CANDIDATE WHO IS OSTENSIBLY AS WEAK AS DONALD\nTRUMP. BOTH HAVE UNLIKABILITY\nNUMBERS. WHO GETS THE MOST MEDIA\nATTENTION SEEMS TO SUFFER IN THE POLLS THAT SHOWS THE\nSHIFT IN THE RACE IN THE LAST FEW DAYS AND WEEKS HAVE\nBEEN RE VERY ROUGH FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nCOMMENT ABOUT DEPLORABLE AMERICANS.\nTHE CHALLENGE WILL BE FOR THE TWO CANDIDATES TO SEE\nWHICH ONE CAN KEEP FROM DOING SOMETHING OR SAYING\nSOMETHING STUPID TO KEEP THEM OUT OF NEWS.\n>> BYRON? >> WELL, JUST AS CLINTON HAS\nHAD A BAD COUPLE OF WEEKS, TRUMP HAS HAD A BETTER\nCOUPLE OF WEEKS. HE HAS BEEN DOING BETTER.\nHE HASN'T SHOT HIMSELF IN THE FOOT LATELY.\nHE HAS MORE VARIED CAMPAIGN. BEEN A BETTER PERFORMER ON\nTHE STUMP. THE OTHER THING ABOUT THESE\nPOLLS, ESPECIALLY IN OHIO, THEY REALLY SHOW THE\nSTRENGTH OF THE ECONOMY AS A FACTOR.\nIF YOU LOOK AT THAT OHIO POLL, A COUPLE OF NUMBERS.\nONE, WHEN WE ASKED PEOPLE WHAT THEIR MOST IMPORTANT\nISSUE IS, IF YOU LOOK AT THOSE ISSUES THAT ARE\nECONOMIC LIKE INCOME, JOBS, TRADE, TAXES, IT IS 63% OF\nTHE PEOPLE. >> TAKING THEM ALL TOGETHER.\n>> EXACTLY. COMBINING THEM THEY ARE 63%.\nTERRORISM AS A ONE CONTRAST IS 5%.\n>> 5%? >> 5%.\n>> DOES THAT THAT SEEMS LIKE OUTLIER.\nTHE BLOOMBERG POLLSTERS ASKED ABOUT NAFTA.\nTHEY SAID HAS NAFTA -- >> -- TALKING ABOUT NEVADA\nNOW? >> NO.\nTHIS IS BLOOMBERG IN OHIO. >> I'M SORRY.\n>> HAS NAFTA INCREASED JOBS IN OHIO OR DECROSSED JOBS IN\nOHIO? 20 PERCENT SAID INCREASED.\n57 PERCENT SAID IT HAS DECREASED.\nTHAT'S A HUGE NUMBER FOR DONALD TRUMP.\n>> HELPS TRUMP. EXACTLY RIGHT.\nGO AHEAD, MOLLY. >> THESE POLLS ARE ALSO IN\nRACES WHERE YOU ARE SEEING A MICROCOSM OF THE OVERALL\nRACE. THESE ISSUES ARE REALLY\nIMPORTANT TO VOTERS. THEY ARE NOT BEING DISCUSSED\nAS MUCH IN THE NATIONAL MEDIA WHICH WANTS TO TALK\nABOUT OTHER ISSUES. WHEN YOU LOOK AT\nIMMIGRATION, ECONOMIC SECURITY, NATIONAL SECURITY,\nTHESE ARE THINGS THAT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT, VOTERS IN NEVADA\nAND VOTERS IN OHIO CARE ABOUT.\nYOU ARE SEEING THAT SHIFT IN THE POLLS AS PEOPLE -- AS\nTHE UNDERLYING FUNDAMENTALS OF THE RACE CONTINUE TO BE\nABOUT THINGS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE\nNATIONAL CONVERSATION IS. >> AND ALSO THE -- I MEAN,\nIF YOU LOOK AT THE NATIONAL NUMBERS, A MONTH AGO HILLARY\nCLINTON HAD AN 8 POINT LEAD IN THE REAL CLEAR POLITICS\nAVERAGE OF POLLS. YOU JUST SAID IT WAS ABOUT\n2% NOW. AND THAT'S MADE UP OF\nSTATES. IT'S GOING TO SHOW THAT IS\nHE DOING BETTER IN THE STATES.\nANOTHER CNN POLL SHOWING A SMALL LEAD IN FLORIDA AND\nNEVADA NUMBER. THESE ARE STATES, BY THE WAY\nTRUMP HAS TO WIN. >> AND LOOKING AT THE SCREEN\nNOW, YOU HAVE JUST SEEN THE FOUR-WAY RACE COMPARISON HAS\nTHE LEAD TO 1.8 POINTS. YOU CAN SAY IT IS A FOUR WAY\nRACE RIGHT NOW. THE HISTORY OF THIRD AND\nFOURTH PARTY CANDIDATES IN THE RACE HAS -- IN RACES HAS\nTENDED TO BE THAT THEY FADE AT THE END.\nTHAT DIDN'T HAPPEN PARTICULARLY TO ROSS PEROT\nBUT HAPPENED IN EVERY OTHER CYCLE I CAN THINK OF.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK THIS TIME. >> TOTALLY DIFFERENT RACE\nBECAUSE OF HOW UNLIKED THESE TWO MAIN CANDIDATES ARE I\nTHINK THIRD PARTY WILL PLAY MORE OF A ROLE.\nALSO IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS A\nMUCH MORE EFFECTIVE CAMPAIGN OPERATION.\n>> YOU MEAN GET OUT THE VOTE OPERATION.\n>> EXACTLY. >> SHE IS GOING TO BE ABLE\nTO TURN OUT VOTES EVEN IF THERE IS ENTHUSIASM GAP.\n>> THIRD PARTIES ARE GOING TO FADE A LITTLE BIT.\nRIGHT NOW GARY JOHNSON IS",

IT IS A LOW BAR BUT THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN WINS THE SCORE BECAUSE THEY PUT OUT MORE INFORMATION.\nNOT AS MUCH AS IN SOME YEARS PAST, PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE\nAGES OF THESE CANDIDATES. SHE IS 68 AND WILL BE 69 NEXT\nMONTH. HE IS 70.\nI'M TOLD BY A TOP ADVISER SHE'S GOING TO PRESS THE CASE\nTOMORROW.

I THINK RIGHT HERE.\nIT'S LIKE TWO CENTIMETERS BY FOUR CENTIMETERS, I THINK IT IS\nIN THIS GENERAL AREA, I WAS LOOKING AT THE ANATOMICAL MAPS,\nIT'S A SUBCUTANEOUS CYST, TWO SEPTEMBER METERS BY FOUR\nCENTIMETERS, APPARENTLY NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.\nTIM KAINE WE NOW KNOW HE ONCE TWISTED HIS SHOULDER.\nTIM KAINE TAKES NO MEDICATION, BUT HIS VITAMIN D IS LOW.\nTHE GOOD NEWS SENATOR KAREN, VITAMIN D COMES IN GUMMIES, IT'S\nTHE HIGHLIGHT OF MY DAY. NOW I KNOW HE USED TO HAVE\nPLANTAR FASCITIS, BUT IT'S NOW FEELING BETTER.\nTHE REASON WE KNOW ALL THIS INTIMATE DISTURBING DETAIL IS\nBECAUSE WE GOT A LOT OF MEDICAL INFORMATION ON TIM KAINE, TURNS\nOUT HE'S FINE. HE'S A LITTLE BIT HUSKY, HE'S\n5'11\" AND 207 POUNDS, A LITTLE ON THE STOCKY SIDE, BUT HE'S\nFINE. WE ALSO GOT HEALTH STATUS\nREPORTS ON JOE BIDEN AND PAUL RYAN, ON SARAH PALIN.\nON TIM KAINE, WE EXPECT ONE SOON ON MIKE PENCE.\nWE GOT A SECOND RELEASE OF HEALTH INFORMATION ABOUT HILLARY\nCLINTON'S HEALTH. THE CAMPAIGN SAYS THE LETTER\nTHEY RELEASED FROM HILLARY CLINTON'S DOCTOR LAST SUMMER WAS\nINTENDED TO BE AN OVERVIEW OF HER TOTAL HEALTH HISTORY AND\nSTATUS. THAT LETTER PAID SPECIAL\nATTENTION AND GAVE SPECIFIC DETAIL ABOUT WHAT THE CAMPAIGN\nDESCRIBED AS THE ONE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH ISSUE HILLARY CLINTON HAS\nHAD AS AN ADULT, WHICH IS THAT CONCUSSION SHE SUFFERED IN 2012.\nIN THAT UPDATED LETTER THEY RELEASED TODAY, THEY DESCRIBED\nAS BASICALLY AN UPDATE ON HER HEALTH STATUS SINCE THAT LAST\nLETTER LAST SUMMER. THEY SAY THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT\nHEALTH ISSUE SHE HAS HAD AS AN ADULT IS THAT CONCUSSION BACK IN\n2012, AND THAT NEW RELEASE GAVE QUITE A LOT OF DETAIL AND\nCHRONOLOGY ABOUT THAT EPISODE THAT SHE HAD THIS WEEKEND THAT\nCAUSED SO MUCH CONCERN, WHEN SHE FELL ILL AT THE 9/11 MEMORIAL\nSERVICE. NOW IT'S SINGLE SPACED AND IT'S\nA LOT OF DETAIL. IT FEELS WEIRD THAT WE'RE\nALLOWED TO KNOW THIS ABOUT ANOTHER PERSON, OUTSIDE OF\nOURSELVES OR OUR IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS, BUT PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATES ARE THE ONE GROUP OF PERSONS THAT DON'T GET THE SAME\nPRIVACY ON THESE MATTERS AS EVERY OTHER AMERICAN DOES, WE\nARE ALLOWED TO KNOW, AND WE EXPECT TO KNOW, THIS IS PART OF\nHOW WE MAKE OUR DECISION ON WHO WE FEEL COMFORTABLE VOTING FOR.\nNOW WE KNOW IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR, HILLARY CLINTON GOT\nSINUSITIS, AND SHE GOT AN EAR INFECTION, ANTIBIOTICS AND\nSTEROIDS DID NOT AL LEIGH THIS PROBLEM.\nIT SHOWED THAT THE SINUSITIS, IS MILD, BUT IT'S CHRONIC, IT'S NOT\nREALLY GOING AWAY, OTHER THAN THAT, ALL IS WELL, HER BRAIN IS\nFINE, NO ABNORMALIIES OF THE BRAIN.\nGOOD THAT WE CAN ALL BRAG ON THE SAME FEATURE.\nFAST FORWARD TO THIS MONTH, TO THE FRIDAY BEFORE THE 9/11\nEVENT, NOT TWO DAYS BEFORE THE 9/11 EVENT, SOME NINE DAYS\nBEFORE 9/11, SHE WENT TO SEE HER DOCTOR, SHE HAD FATIGUE, SHE HAD\nCON GUESTATION. THIS WAS AROUND THE TIME THAT\nHER CAMPAIGN MANAGER WAS HOSPITALIZED WITH AN UPPER\nRESPIRATORY INFECTION AS WELL. AFTER THAT SEPTEMBER 2 VISIT TO\nHER DAUGHTER, SHE APPARENTLY TOOK A SHORT-TERM COURSE OF\nANTIBIOTICS WHICH DID NOT HELP, SHE CAME BACK AND THAT'S WHEN\nTHE DOCTOR DID A NONCONTRAST CHEST CT SCAN, WHICH IS\nAPPARENTLY ONE STEP UP FROM A CHEST X RAY AND IT REVEALED,\nQUOTE, MILD, NONCONTAGIOUS BACTERIAL PNEUMONIA, THE DOCTOR\nSAYS THAT HILLARY CLINTON AT THAT POINT WAS ADVISED TO REST.\nWE NOW KNOW THAT SHE DID NOT. WE WENT BACK AND LOOKED AT OUR\nNBC COVERAGE CALENDAR, FROM THAT DAY THAT SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH\nPNEUMONIA, THAT SAME DAY, HILLARY CLINTON DID A\nFUND-RAISER IN MANHATTAN, SHE HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE, SHE DID\nMULTIPLE MEDIA INTERVIEWS, SHE DID ANOTHER FUND-RAISER,\nFOLLOWED BY ANOTHER FUND RAISER AND SHE WENT TO ANOTHER MEMORIAL\nSERVICE ON SUNDAY AND THAT WAS WHEN SHE HAD THAT EPISODE THAT\nFREQUENTED EVERYBODY OUT. SECRETARY CLINTON CONTINUES TO\nIMPROVE, SHE'S BEEN OFF THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL RESTING SINCE\nSUNDAY, BUT SHE'S DUE BACK ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL TOMORROW IN\nNORTH CAROLINA. THE NEW LETTER FROM CLINTON'S\nDOCTOR CONCLUDES AS FOLLOWS, QUOTE, MY OVERALL IMPRESSION\nTHAT IS THAT MRS. CLINTON HAS REMAINED HEALTHY AND HAS NOT\nDEVELOPED NEW MEDICAL CONDITIONS THIS YEAR OTHER THAN A SINUS\nINFECTION AND AN EAR INFECTION OTHER THAN HER CURRENT STATUS OF\nPNEUMONIA, AND SHE CONTINUES TO BE HEALTHY AND FIT TO SERVE AS\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THEY BASICALLY NOW CONSIDER THIS\nDONE, THEY HAVE NOW RELEASED IN THEIR ESTIMATION MUCH MORE\nDETAILED HEALTH INFORMATION THAN OTHER HEALTHY PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATES DID, PEOPLE LIKE BARACK OBAMA OR MITT ROMNEY.\nTHEY SAY THEY ARE NOT PLANNING WHAT SOME PEOPLE CALL A FULL\nMcCAIN, A UNIVERSAL RELEASE OF HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF\nPAGES, EVERY HEALTH RELATED DOCUMENT THAT'S EVER BEEN\nPRODUCED OVER THE COURSE OF HILLARY CLINTON'S LIFETIME, THEY\nSAID THAT KIND OF RELEASE IS NOT WARRANTED.\nESSENTIALLY BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH HISTORY IS\nNOTHING LIKE JOHN McCAIN'S HEALTH HISTORY, NOT LEAST\nBECAUSE OF HIS MULTIPLE AND RECURRING BATTLES WITH CANCER,\nWHICH SHE HAS NOTHING NEAR. SO AS FAR AS THEY'RE CONCERNED\nTHEY'RE DONE. ON THE OTHER SIDE, NATURALLY\nIT'S NOW UTTER AND COMPLETE CHAOS.\nAND THE DIFFICULT PART OF THIS FOR ME IS THAT I THINK PART OF\nIT MIGHT BE MY FAULT.

LET'S GET OUT TO TRACIE POTTS.\nTRACIE, BOTH CANDIDATES ARE TRYING TO GET WAY FROM THE\nHEALTH ISSUE, BUT IT SEEMS THAT THEY CAN'T.\n>> YEAH, IT'S SORT OF LIKE A RACE TO THE DOCTOR WITH THE\nMEDICAL RECORDS BETWEEN THESE TWO, HILLARY CLINTON WHO WE\nHAVEN'T SEEN FOR FOUR DAY. SHE'LL BE OUT TODAY IN NORTH\nCAROLINA IN A SPEECH THAT IS SUPPOSED TO FOCUS ON THE THEME\nOF HER CAMPAIGN. THIS WILL BE THE FIRST TIME THAT\nWE'VE SEEN HER. AFTER THAT SHE'S GOING TO SPEND\nTHE NEXT FEW DAYS HERE IN WASHINGTON.\nAND SHE DID RELEASE THAT TWO-PAGE -- I SHOULD SAY THAT\nEXTENSIVE LETTER FROM HER DODGE TORE SAYING A NUMBER OF THINGS\nSAYING SHE HAS BEEN ON A BLOOD THINNER TO MAKE SURE SHE'S SAFE\nFROM BLOOD CLOTS WHICH SHE HAS SUFFERED FROM IN THE PAST.\nSHE HAS LOW CHOLESTEROL, ACCORDING TO HER DOCTOR, AND IS\nNOT ONLY HEALTHY AND FIT TO SERVE, BUT THIS WAS AN\nINTERESTING NOTE, IS MENTALLY IN EXCELLENT CONDITION SHE NOTED\nTHAT LETTER. THEN THERE'S DONALD TRUMP WHO\nDID THAT PIECE YOU SAW IN \"THE DR. OZ SHOW\" THAT EVERYONE ELSE\nWILL SEE TODAY WHERE HE RELEASED NOT NECESSARILY DETAILED MEDICAL\nHISTORY BUT CERTAINLY THE MOST RECENT SCREENINGS THAT HE'S HAD\nALONG WITH SOME A LITTLE BIT BEFORE THAT WHERE DR. OZ SORT OF\nQUICKLY LOOKED THROUGH THEM. HE TOLD US IN AN INTERVIEW LATER\nHE DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO REVIEW THEM IN ADVANCE, SO HE'S QUICK\nLIG LOOKING THROUGH THEM. HE THINKS HE'S IN EXCELLENT\nSHAPE, COULD STAND TO EXERCISE AND EAT A LITTLE BETTER.\nHE LIKES FAST FOOD. AS YOU SAID, LOSE A FEW POINTS.\nWHAT'S INTERESTING IS 70 YEARS OLD AND 68 YEARS OLD.\nDONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON, THE TWO OLDEST IF\nELECTED TO EVER TAKE OFFICE. AND THIS HEALTH ISSUE HAS BECOME\nA REAL ISSUE FOR BOTH OF THEM. >> TRACIE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nTRACIE POTTS FROM NBC NEWS. I COULDN'T DO WHAT THEY'RE\nDOING. >> DO YOU WANT TO COME TO WORK\nLIKE THAT EVERY DAY? >> IT'S GRUELING.\nABSOLUTELY GRUELLING. >> THEY'RE THE OLDEST AS TRACIE\nSAID. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO RELEASE\nEVERYTHING. IMAGINE YOU'VE GOT 90 WARTS ON\nYOUR HAND. >> WHAT IMPACT WILL TRUMP HAVE\nON THE ECONOMY ACCORDING TO ONE, TRUMP COULD WIPE A TRILLION FROM\nTHE ECONOMY.

THEY SAY THEY'LL BE PUTTING OUT\nA DETAILED ACCOUNT OF HER HEALTH BUT THEY'VE RELEASED SOME BULLET\nPOINTS NOW. THEY SAY IN TERMS OF HER\nPNEUMONIA DIAGNOSIS LAST FRIDAY, HILLARY CLINTON HAD A\nNON-CONTRAST CHEST CT SCAN THAT WAS PERFORMED LAST FRIDAY.\nTHE RESULTS REVEALED A SMALL RIGHT MIDDLE LOBE PNEUMONIA.\nTHEY ALSO SAY THIS WAS A MILD, NON-CONTAGIOUS BACTERIAL\nPNEUMONIA. THEY SAY SECRETARY CLINTON WAS\nTREATED WITH LEVAQUIN WHICH SHE WAS ADVISED TO TAKE FOR 10 DAYS.\nSHE HAD A NORMAL BREAST ULTRASOUND AND HILLARY CLINTON\nREMAINS FIT TO SERVE FOR THE UNITED STATES.\nWE'LL HAVE THAT LETTER AS SOON AS THEY PUT THAT OUT AS WELL.\n>> THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS ABOUT THIS\nMcCAIN STANDARD FOR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES, FOR MAYBE TAKING A\nSMALL GROUP OF REPORTERS OR AN EXPERT, OPENING UP YOUR MEDICAL\nRECORDS AND HAVING A LOOK. ANY SIGN THAT WE'RE GOING\nTHROUGH SOMETHING LIKE THAT HERE?\n>> IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE THAT. BOTH CANDIDATES HAVE BEEN\nHESITANT TO PUT OUT BLANK STATEMENTS ABOUT THEIR MEDICAL\nRECORDS. THE QUESTION IS, WITH THE AGE WE\nHAVE OF THE CANDIDATES THIS YEAR, IS THAT A WISE CHOICE FOR\nAMERICAN VOTERS WHO WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE HEALTH OF THESE TWO\nCANDIDATES? I THINK IF ANYTHING IT POINTS\nMORE TO THE VICE PRESIDENT. IF THE PRESIDENT ELECT WERE TO\nHAVE ANY KIND OF HEALTH ISSUE, VOTERS WANT TO LOOK AT THE VICE\nPRESIDENTIAL CHOICE AS WELL, AND THAT CHOICE IS OUT THERE AS WELL\nFOR VOTERS TO MAKE A DETERMINATION.\n>> IT'S ALSO ABOUT TRANSPARENCY, AND I GUESS THAT'S THE ISSUE A\nLOT OF REPORTERS HAD WHEN THIS HAPPENED ON SUNDAY WHICH WAS,\nWHY DON'T YOU TELL US EITHER WHEN YOU GET THE PNEUMONIA\nDIAGNOSIS IN THE FIRST PLACE OR TELL US WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS\nHAPPENS WHY THERE'S BEEN AN INCIDENT.\n>> RIGHT, LIMITED HISTORY GIVEN OUT OVER THE WEEKEND.\nIT WASN'T UNTIL HILLARY CLINTON'S WOBBLY MOMENT AT THE\n9/11 CEREMONY ON SUNDAY THAT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN FINALLY SAID,\nYES, SHE'S BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA.\nAFTER THAT THEY GAVE DIFFERENT  SINCE THE PNEUMONIA DIAGNOSIS,\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF, HAS BEEN VERY HANDS OFF\nIN TERMS OF HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT, I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO\nTHAT. I WISH HER WELL AND HOPE SHE CAN\nGET BACK ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. SO A DIFFERENT TACTIC HERE THAN\nYOU MIGHT EXPECT FROM THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WHICH MAY BE THINKING\nTHAT THIS STORY IS PLAYING OUT ON ITS OWN AND WE BETTER JUST\nLEAVE IT ALONE FOR NOW. >> WE'LL SEE WHAT WE FIND OUT\nFROM DONALD TRUMP WHEN HE VISITS",

HE HAD DOCTORS POURING OVER THE\nINFORMATION. THEY COULDN'T LEAVE A ROOM.\nTHEY CONVEYED THAT TO JOURNALISTS COVERING THE\nCAMPAIGN. IT DIDN'T DO SQUAT FOR HIM.\n>> Caller: IT WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE HE HAD THE HISTORY WITH\nMELANOMA. THAT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER.\nKERRY, OF COURSE, HAD MEDICAL ISSUES AS WELL.\nRIGHT NOW, THE QUESTION THIS WEEK -- THE POLITICAL QUESTION\nIS REALLY AROUND TRANSPARENCY. AND THIS IDEA THAT THESE\nCANDIDATES SHOULD BE DISCLOSING MORE ABOUT THEMSELVES THAN THEY\nCURRENTLY ARE. >> WELL PUT.\nTHANK YOU VERY MUCH.

HAVE WE BEEN OVERREACTING TO THE\nSPIKE IN VOLATILITY OR YEELS GOING HIGHER OR IS SOMETHING\nMORE OF CONCERN HAPPENING? >> WELL, I THINK WE'RE PROBABLY\nOVERREACTING, BUT, I MEAN I ATTRIBUTE MOST OF THIS\nUNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE PATH FORWARD FOR CENTRAL BANKS.\nI THROUGH ALL OF A SUDDEN SOME NERVOUSNESS HAS CREPT INTO THE\nMARKETS THAT THEY'RE BACKING AWAY FROM THEIR SUPPORT.\nIF YOU LOOK AT THE BANK OF JAPAN, FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN THEY\nINSTITUTED RATES, IT WAS A FASHIONAL DISASTER FOR THEM.\nYOU CAN'T BLAME THEM FOR WANTING TO STEP BACK AND TAKE THEIR TIME\nON WHAT THE NEXT MOVE IS. THE NEXT MOVE DOES INVOLVE\nADDITIONAL STIMULUS AND THE SITUATION IS THE SAME IN EUROPE.\nTHE ECB KNOWS THAT IT'S GOING TO SOMEHOW ADJUST ITS PROGRAM\nBECAUSE IT'S RUNNING OUT OF TIME AND BONDS TO BUY, BUT THEY DON'T\nHAVE TO DO THAT UNTIL DECEMBER SO THAT, YOU KNOW, GIVES THEM\nTIME TO MAKE IT POLITICALLY PAL ITABLE TO THE REST OF THE\nGOVERNING COUNCIL. THAT'S CAUSING SOME NEAR TERM\nVOLATILITY. I THINK IT'S GOING TO GO AWAY,\nQUITE FRANKLY, BECAUSE STIMULUS IS HERE TO STAY.\n>> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE ONE-YEAR AND HOW DOES IT DRIVE\nYOUR INVESTMENT DECISIONS BASED ON WHERE IT GOES NEXT?\n>> I THINK A COUPLE OF THINGS. ONE IS IF YOU DO BELIEVE THAT\nCENTRAL BANKS ARE PULLING BACK, IT MEANS THAT THERE'S GOING TO\nBE LESS BUYING DEMAND AT THE LONG END OF THE YIELD CURVE AND\nTHAT WILL SPILL OVER INTO THE U.S., BUT I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT\nTHAT WE'RE JUST BACK TO WHERE THE TEN YEAR YIELD WAS BEFORE\nTHE BREXIT VOTE. WE'RE EXACTLY AT THE SAME LEVEL.\nSO, YOU KNOW, I WOULDN'T READ TOO MUCH INTO IT AT THIS POINT.\nIF YOU LAP TO BE LONG, HOWEVER, OBVIOUSLY, IT'S BEEN PAINFUL.\nBUT I THINK BEGINNING NEXT WEEK, YOU KNOW, WITH THE BOJ'S MEETING\nAND THEN FOLLOWING ON LATER IN THE QUARTER WITH THE ECB'S\nMEETING, I THINK WE'LL GET",

THE SAME GOES FOR OUR MAIN\nEUROPEAN EQUITY MARKETS INDICATE FLAGTISH START TO THE TRADE\nTODAY. WE'RE LOOK AT IT.\nJUST BRIEFLY GLANCING AT IT. YOU'VE GOT REAL ESTATE.\nTHE FX MARKETS. HERE YOU'RE LOOKING ALSO AGAINST\nSTABILITY, FOR EXAMPLE, THE POUND.\nTHE S & B SAYING IT REMAINED SIGNIFICANTLY OVERVALUED.\nNOW, THE LAST BATCH OF U.S. ECONOMIC DATA AUGUST RESALE\nSAILS DOWN IS SET FOR RELEASE AS FED WATCHERS WAIT TO SEE IF THIS\nLAST PUBLICATION COULD PUSH THE FED TOWARD A SEPTEMBER RATE\nHIKE. LET'S GET IN PETER ROSEN\nROSENSTREICH. >> I THINK WE'RE PROBABLY STUCK\nAT THIS FOIMT. WE'RE STUCK AT A SLIGHTLY WEAKER\nRETAIL NUMBER AFTER THE JULY NUMBER.\nI THINK THE INCOMING DATA IS PROBABLY GOING PLAY LESS OF A\nROLE THAN PERHAPS THE FEDSPEAK DID COMING IN.\nI THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE GOING TO CRUISE INTO THE MEETING.\nSNOOP WE'VE SEEN THAT YIELDING CURVE STEEPING HIGHER.\nTHAT'S BEEN SPOOKING STOCKS. WHAT DO YOU THINK?\n>> TWO THINGS. ONE, IT IS NOT THE POPPING OF\nTHE BOND BUBBLE. >> WHY NOT?\n>> FIRST OF ALL, WE DON'T THINK THE GLOBAL LOOSE MONETARY\nPOLICY, YOU KNOW, REGIME IS OVER.\nWE DON'T BELIEVE THE FED IS GOING TO RAISE RATES IN\nSEPTEMBER AND VERY UNLIKELY TO RAISE RATES IN DECEMBER AS WELL.\nNUMBER TWO, THERE'S AN ENORMOUS WALL OF MONEY OUT THERE, $10\nTRILLION ESTIMATED, YIELDING PAPER, WHICH AS SOON AS THOSE\nNUMBERS START RISING SIGNIFICANTLY, THE U.S. CURVE\nSTARTS RALLYING SIGNIFICANTLY, WE SEE THAT MONEY POUR RIGHT\nBACK INTO IT AND SUPPRESS THE YIELD RALLY.\nWE SAW THAT ON FRIDAY WHEN THE GERMAN YIELD TICKED ABOVE\nNEGATIVE LEVELS. ALL OF A SUDDEN EVERYBODY RUSHED\nFROM THE U.S. INTO GERMAN PAPER. I THINK THAT WALL OF MONEY WILL\nSUPPRESS ANY TYPE OF POPPING OF THE BUBBLE.\n>> WHAT'S A FAIR LEVEL FOR THE U.S. TENURE?\nWE WERE AT THREE-MONTH HIGHS ON THE YIELD.\n1.75. WE'RE NOW AT 1.71.\nWHERE ARE WE GOING. >> AGAIN, WE HAVE A SUBDUED OR\nDOVISH VIEW ON THE ECONOMY AND I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE EXPRESSED\nVERY CLEARLY. I DO BELIEVE 1.06, 1.65 IS A\nSAFER BET CONCERNING WHAT EVERYTHING ELSE IS DOING.\nALL OF THAT IS GOING TO KEEP A LID ON WHERE THE U.S. TENURES\nCAN GO. SO OVERALL WE THINK THE MIXED\nDATA OF THE U.S. IS REALLY NOT GOING TO PUT TOO MUCH PRESSURE\nON THE YIELD CURVE. >> YOU SAY YOU CONTINUE TO\nREHOLD ON THE SHORTS THAT YOU ALREADY HOLD.\n>> CORRECT. WE DON'T BELIEVE IN THIS SORT OF\nRALLY. WE DON'T BELIEVE IN THIS YIELD\nRALLY AS WELL. SO WE THINK THAT, YOU KNOW,\nLOOKING FOR MORE VALUE, CHASING THAT YIELD WHILE, YOU KNOW, IT\nMIGHT BE UNATTRACTIVE AND ONE THAT'S COMPLETELY OVERPLAYED AT\nTHIS POINT, IT'S STILL GOING TO BE THE BEST BET OUT THERE.\n>> WHAT ARE SOME OF THE SHORTS? >> WELL, ONE OF THE SHORTS WOULD\nPROBABLY BE THINGS LIKE THE DOLLAR, SWISS FRANC, MOVING INTO\nYEN TRADES, E.M. CURRENCIES. MEXICO, HIGH RISK.\nWE THINK THIS BLAST WE'VE SEEN RECENTLY IS NOT GOING TO HOLD UP\nAND WHEN PEOPLE START REALIZING THE FED IS NOT GOING TO DO\nANYTHING AND WE'RE IN THAT SORT OF GOLDILOCKS POSITION WHERE LOW\nINTEREST RATES, LOW GROWTH ARE GOING TO KEEP CENTRAL BANKS\nCONSERVATIVE, WE'LL SEE IT COME DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY.\n>> CAN I ASK YOU ABOUT THE SNB. IS IT FAIR TO SAY THE SNB IS\nREACTING TO THE OTHER AT THIS POINT?\n>> IT COULD BE. IF THEY WERE TRYING TO SET\nPOLICY, THEY WOULD PROBABLY GET WASHED OVER.\nSO I THINK BY STANDING ASIDE AND UNDERSTANDING THE CAPABILITIES,\nTHAT'S CRITICAL. I THINK WHAT'S ALSO NOTICEABLE\nIS THEIR COMMUNICATION STRATEGY IS VERY TIGHTER THAN WHAT WE SEE\nIN THE FEDS ESPECIALLY WHERE EVERY FED MEMBER IS COMING OUT\nAND PUSHING THEIR IDEAS AND GETTING INTERPRETED BY THE\nMARKET AND CAUSING SIGNIFICANTLY ROGUE VOLATILITY OUT OF NOWHERE\nAND EXTREMELY DISRUPTIVE. THE SNB IS MUCH MORE\nCONSERVATIVE AND HAS BEEN -- YOU KNOW, THEY HAVEN'T HAD A\nSIGNIFICANT POLICY SPEECH SINCE, I DON'T KNOW, APRIL OR MAY OF\nTHIS YEAR. SO IT ALLOWS THE MARKET TO SORT\nOF LOOK AT THE DA TARKS YOU KNOW, NOT TRY TO INTERPRET\nEVERYTHING THAT'S BEING SAID. AND I THINK IT'S A VERY GOOD WAY\nAND A GOOD MODEL FOR MANY CENTRAL BANKS MOVING FORWARD.\n>> NOW IT BRINGS ME TO THE BOJ. MAYBE THERE'S TOO MUCH TALK, TOO\nMUCH EXPECTATIONS. WE DID SEE A WEAKENING OF THE\nYEN THERE. DO YOU THINK THAT'S SUSTAIN\nSNBL. >> I THINK THEY WERE CAUGHT IN\nTHIS SORT OF COMMUNICATION TRAP, YOU KNOW, WHERE THEY'VE\nEXPRESSED WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO WITH ECONOMICS AND THEY\nSAY HOW THEY'RE GOING TO TARGET INFLATION, AND NONE OF IT'S COME\nTRUE. THE CREDIBILITY IS REALLY IN A\nROCKY PLACE, THEY'RE PROBABLY GOING TO COME OUT WITH AN\nASSESSMENT THAT SAYS WE NEED MORE TIME, MORE INFLATION MARKS.\nTHEY COULD PROBABLY TAKE A GOOD STANCE IN LEARNING WHAT THE\nSNB'S DONE. I THINK THAT'S A GOOD EXAMPLE.\nWE DON'T EXPECT SOMETHING AT NEXT WEEK'S MEETING.\nIT'S JUST GOING TO SAY THE POLICY'S NOT WORKING.\nWE'LL CONTINUE TO SEE REPETRIE YAGS.\n>> THEY CAN GET BACK BEYOND 1.05, YOU SAY?\n>> I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY CHALLENGING.\nTHE DOLLAR/YEN TRADES SIGNIFICANTLY O ON THE\nDOLLAR/YEN SPREAD AND WE'RE SEEING A PRIOR WIDENING OF THE\nFRONT END YIELDS, SO AS THAT CONTRACTS, I THINK WE'LL SEE\nCONTINUED STRENGTH IN THE YEN. I THINK IT WILL BE DIFFICULT\nWITH THE FED NOT RAISING RATES FOR THE DOLLAR/YEN TO GO ABOVE\nTHAT 1.05 LEVEL. >> PETER, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR\nYOUR TIME.

ONE INPUT THAT PREDOMINATES, I\nTHINK, FALSELY, IS THE PRICE OF OIL.\nWE'VE BEEN TRAPPED IN THIS MACROWORLD AS MEASURED BY\nCOMMODITY PRICING MEANING BIGGER FUND MANAGERS LOOK AT OIL AS A\nVIRTUAL THERMOMETER. ANY TIME THE PRICE OF OIL DROPS\nAS IT DID TODAY, PLUMMETING $1.26 DOWN TO $43.64 ANY TIME\nOILS RALLY, THAT'S A SIGN DEMAND IS PICKING UP.\nI MEAN RIDICULOUS. THIS IS RIDICULOUS.\nTHE PRICE OF CRUDE IS THE SUM OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND, OKAY?\nWITH SUPPLY READY TO OVERWHELM ANY DEMAND, EVEN DEMAND THAT'S\n10, 15, 20% STRONGER THAN IT IS NOW.\nWHEN U.S. OIL INVENTORIES DROP AS THEY DID TODAY, YOU HAVE A\nFLEETING RALLY IN CRUDE AND THEN A DECLINE BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE\nTHAT THERE'S STILL A GLUT. TOO MUCH OIL BEING PRODUCED.\nLATER AS OIL HEADS TO $40 FROM $43, YOU THEN GET A REBOUND\nBECAUSE THE COUNTRIES THAT WANT THE PRICE HIGHER SPREAD RUMORS\nOF AN EMERGENCY OPEC MEETING TO FREEZE PRODUCTION.\nTHIS RUMOR MONGERING WORKS LIKE A CHARM EVERY TIME.\nIN OTHER WORDS, THE PRICE OF OIL, IT'S MANIPULATED.\nIT'S BOGUS. AND IT HAS LITTLE TO NOTHING TO\nDO WITH THE REAL DEMAND WE NEED TO CALCULATE TO MAKE OUR WORLD\nVIEW, EVEN AS IT'S THE METRIC OF CHOICE FOR SO MANY FUND\nMANAGERS. OTHERS USE THE PRICE OF METALS\nLIKE COPPER AND STEEL. ONE OF THE REASONS IS COPPER HAS\nBEEN DISPLACED BY OTHER MATERIALS.\nIT'S AN INDICATOR OF NOTHING. SO WHAT AM I LOOKING AT?\nIN THE U.S. FIRST IT'S EMPLOYMENT.\nI'M STILL ENCOURAGED. I THINK EMPLOYMENT IS RELATIVELY\nSTRONG. IT'S WHY I DON'T FEAR A RATE\nHIKE AS MUCH AS OTHERS. THAT'S BASED ON MY FORECAST BAY\nLOOKING BACK AT WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE FED TIGHTENED IN\nSEPTEMBER. NEXT I LOOK AT HOUSING.\nHOUSING DEMAND REMAINS STRONG IN THIS COUNTRY.\nWE'RE TALKING TO TOLL BROTHERS LATER TONIGHT AND THEIR VIEW IS\nPRETTY POSITIVE ON THAT LATEST CONFERENCE CALL.\nWHEN HOUSING IS ROBUST, THAT MEANS SPENDING TO FIX UP A HOUSE\nIS STRONG, AND THAT'S A MAJOR PIECE OF OUR HUGE RETAIL\nECONOMY. HOW ABOUT NON-REALLY\nCONSTRUCTION? BIG CHUNK.\nBIG CHUNK OF THE BUSINESS. I SPEAK TO SEVERAL COMPANIES IN\nEVERY SILO OF NON-REALLY FROM THE CONSTRUCTION LOANS IN ALL\nGEOGRAPHIES TO THE MATERIALS NEEDED TO ERECT BUILDINGS TO THE\nFIXTURES, HEATING, AIR-CONDITIONING, LIGHTING,\nVENTILATION COMPANIES. MY JUDGMENT?\nTHINGS ARE PRETTY GOOD. WHILE I DON'T LIKE THE\nAUTOMOBILE STOCKS BECAUSE THE WORLDWIDE ENTERPRISE ISN'T AS\nHEALTHY AS I'D LIKE AS I JUST SAID, THE DEMAND IN THE U.S. IS\nSTRONG WITH SUVs AND TRUCKS SELLING VERY WELL.\nAEROSPACE, STRONG OUT OF BOEING TODAY.\nAT THE ACTUAL STORE LEVEL, IT IS MIXED, NOT TERRIBLE.\nCASUAL DINING IS NOT GOOD. LOOK AT CRACKER BARREL DOWN $10\nTODAY. BUT SOME OF THAT IS BECAUSE IT'S\nJUST A LOT CHEAPER TO STAY HOME THANKS TO THE DECLINE IN THE\nPRICE OF FOOD MENTIONED ON THE CRACKER BARREL CALL.\nI BELIEVE THERE'S ALSO BEEN A TAMPING OF DEMAND FROM INCREASED\nHEALTH CARE BILLS. RETAILERS, HIT OR MISS.\nWE SEE STRENGTH OF WALMART AND AMAZON WHICH ARE A HUGE PART OF\nTHE RETAIL EQUATION. DEPARTMENT STORES, NOT GREAT ALL\nWE WE HAD A KEY UP GRADE AT MACY'S TODAY.\nBACK TO SCHOOL, NOT BAD AT ALL. GO --\nAND THEN THERE'S PERHAPS THE MOST OVERLOOKED GAUGE OF DEMAND\nIN THIS COUNTRY, AND THAT'S THE HUGE AND, YES, ENTIRELY\nUNEXPECTED INCREASE IN ORDERS FOR APPLE'S SUPPOSEDLY BLAH\niPHONE 7. WHEN YOU HAVE SPRINT AND\nT-MOBILE SAYING THEY HAVE OFF THE CHART DEMANDS FOR THE PHONE,\nWHEN AT&T TELLS US TODAY THAT DEMAND IS BETTER THAN EXPECTED\nAND VERIZON SAYS IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE PREDICTIONS CEO LOWELL\nMcADAM MADE ON THIS SHOW, THAT THE iPHONE IS INDEED SELLING\nVERY WELL, THEN IT'S AN ACTUAL NEEDLE MOVER.\nHENCE THE TERRIFIC RUN IN APPLE STOCK.\nTHE SESSION'S LEADER. WE KNOW THAT MILLENNIALS NOW\nREPRESENT ABOUT HALF THE CONSUMER DEMAND IN THIS COUNTRY\nAND THEY SPEND ON WAY DIFFERENT THINGS THAN OTHER GENERATIONS\nINCLUDING MY OWN.

THE iPHONE 7.\nHOW DO YOU SHARE YOUR EXPENSES BEST?\nWITH BEAUTIFUL PICTURES TAKEN ON YOUR BRAND-NEW iPHONE.\nYOU HAVE A BILLION iPHONE USERS AND THEY'RE WILLING TO SPEND\nHUNDREDS OF DOLLARS ON THEIR PHONES, THESE NEW ONES THAT THEY\nOTHERWISE WOULD SPEND ON SOMETHING ELSE BECAUSE THEY WANT\nTHE PROCESSING POWER. THEY WANT THE SPEED.\nTHAT'S PURE DEMAND. NOW, I KNOW THAT MY MOSAIC SEEMS\nNOTHING BUT A SERIES OF ANECDOTES.\nWE WANT SOMEONE FROM A -- WE WANT A COMMERCE DEPARTMENT\nNUMBER TO CAPTURE WHAT I JUST PUT TOGETHER.\nWE WANT SOME GRAND INQUISITOR TO ASK QUESTIONS AND MAKE SENSE OF\nEVERYTHING AND THEN MIND MELD IT WITH AN ALGORITHM THAT SHOWS US\nWHAT THE ECONOMY WILL DO GIVEN THAT SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES.\nTHAT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN. YOU'RE STUCK WITH MY ANECDOTES.\nHERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE, THOUGH. THE PLURAL OF ANECDOTE IS DATA,\nAND BASED ON THE DATA, I THINK WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH DEMAND TO\nKEEP THE MARKET FROM GOING LOWER.\nBUT WE DO HAVE ENOUGH DEMAND TO CONTAIN THE DECLINE TO LEVELS\nTHAT AREN'T DANGEROUS.

OKAY, YOU HAD JAMIE DIMON THIS\nWEEK SAYING YOU SHOULD GO AHEAD AND DO IT.\nRAY DALIO SAID DON'T DO IT. HE DISAGREES.\nYOU HAVE ASYMMETRIC RISKS. ICAHN SAYS IF YOU DON'T DO IT,\nYOU'RE GOING TO BE IN THIS TREMENDOUS BUBBLE, AND THAT'S A\nTHOUGHT THAT WAS SOMEWHAT ECHOED, I THINK, THIS WEEK BY I\nTHINK ERIC ROSENGREN. MAYBE IT WAS ONE OF THE OTHER\nFED OFFICIALS WHO SAID IT. THE POINT WAS MADE ABOUT THESE\nBUBBLES AND RATES. WHAT'S THE RIGHT CALL HERE?\n>> I THINK THEY SHOULD DO IT BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW.\nRIGHT NOW YOU CAN DO IT. THE MARKET HAS ESSENTIALLY DONE\nIT FOR YOU WITH BACKING UP RATES GLOBALLY.\nIT'S ALMOST LIKE THE FED HAS A FREEBIE.\nTHAT THERE'S -- EVEN THOUGH THE ODDS OF DOING IT ACCORDING TO\nFED FUNDS FUTURES HAVE COME DOWN DRAMATICALLY, I DON'T THINK THE\nMARKET WOULD BE SURPRISED IF YOU DID IT.\n25 BIPS ISN'T GOING TO THROW ANYBODY OVER THE EDGE.\nIT'S NOT GOING TO IMPACT ANY REAL ASSET CLASS.\n25 BITS, YOU ARE AT HISTORICALLY ROCK BOTTOM RATES.\nI SAY DO IT. >> THIS COMMENT THAT HE MADE, IN\nOTHER WORDS, YOU ARE WALKING ON A LEDGE, AND YOU MIGHT MAKE IT\nTO THE END, BUT YOU FALL OFF THAT LEDGE, YOU'RE GOING TO\nREALLY SEE TROUBLE. I THINK THAT COULD WELL BE.\n>> IT'S NOT THAT BIG OF A DROP.

WHEN YOU REALLY LOOK AT THIS\nTHING, LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE WITH THE RATES.\nTHIS QUARTER POINT, LIKE YOU SAY, WE'RE AT RECORD LOWS.\nWE GO A QUARTER POINT. IF THAT REALLY IS GOING TO MESS\nUP THE MARKET AND GET US TO GET SOME SORT OF AN 8% SELL-OFF OR\nSOME CRAZY THING, THEN I THINK IT WILL CREATE SOME\nOPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE AN OVERREACTION OF THE\nMARKETS ONCE AGAIN.

I'M ADVERTISING TO THE MARKET SO\nI CAN BUY AT A HIGHER PRICE TO GET TO 50%.\n>> RIGHT. BUT THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT WOULD\nBE ISN'T THAT A SHOT ACROSS THE BOW MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE?\nWOULD YOU WANT TO BE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE POTENTIAL OF\nTHAT? >> NO, BUT MY POINT IS I DON'T\nTHINK HE HAS ANY INTENTION TO GO TO 50% OR ANY INTENTION\nNECESSARILY TO GO TO 30%. I THINK HE IS DOING THE SHORT\nSQUEEZE. IF YOU GO BACK TO WHAT IS GOING\nON IN THE MARKETS, IF YOU GO BACK TO WHAT HE DID WITH CONSECO\nAND IRWIN JACOBS WHERE HE WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE AND ALLEGEDLY HAD\nA 22% SHORT INTEREST, IN 2000, 2001, AND IT WAS MENTIONED BY\nACKMAN WHEN YOU DID THAT FAMOUS THING ON JANUARY 25th.\nHE IS ON THE OTHER SIDE. HE DID WHAT HE SAID NO\nPROFESSIONAL WOULD DO.

BECAUSE THESE ATTEMPTS BY RUSSIA\nTO INTERFERE IN THE ELECTION, ARE ONES THAT GO RIGHT HAND IN\nHAND WITH HIS CLOSENESS TO THE KREMLIN, HIS FLATTERY OF PUTIN,\nAND IT'S NOT JUST ME THAT IS NOTICING THIS, IT'S FELLOW\nREPUBLICANS OF FOREIGN POLICY AND NATIONAL SECURITY\nEXPERIENCE, NATO LEADERS, SO I'M GOING TO KEEP, YOU KNOW, RAISING\nTHE ALARGE ABOUT RUSSIAN INFLUENCE AND THAT, OF COURSE,\nRAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT WHO TRUMP ACTUALLY DOES BUSINESS WITH.\n>> CAN I -- CAN I JUST FOLLOW AND SAY THAT BY HUBRIS HE'S\nSAYING THAT YOU'RE -- YOU'RE STEPPING ON YOUR MESSAGE.\nHE'S INSINUATING THAT YOU STEP ON YOUR MESSAGE THROUGH HUBRIS\nOR ARROGANCE OR NOT BEING TRANSPARENT.\nHOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT SPECIFICALLY?\n>> AGAIN, I'M NOT -- YOU KNOW, I'M NOT GOING TO COMMENT ON\nANYTHING THAT IS SAID IN A PRIVATE E-MAIL.\n>> AND EVEN TO CRITICS BEYOND THE FORMER SECRETARY?\n>> WELL BUT I THINK I'VE WORKED VERY, VERY HARD TO BE MORE\nTRANSPARENT THAN NOT JUST MY OPPONENT, BUT REALLY IN A\nCOMPARISON TO ANYBODY WHO'S RUN, YOU KNOW, THE MEDICAL\nINFORMATION I'VE PUT OUT. AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT OUT MORE.\nMEETS AND EXCEEDS THE STANDARDS THAT OTHER PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATES, INCLUDING PRESIDENT OBAMA AND YOU KNOW MITT ROMNEY\nAND OTHERS HAVE MET. MY TAX RETURNS ARE OUT THERE, 40\nYEARS OF TRANSPARENCY ABOUT MY TAX RETURNS.\nSO I THINK THAT THE REAL QUESTIONS NEED TO BE DIRECTD\nTOWARD DONALD TRUMP, AND HIS FAILURE TO EVEN MEET THE MOST\nMINIMALISTIC STANDARDS THAT WE EXPECT OF SOMEONE BEING THE\nNOMINEE OF ONE OF OUR TWO MAJOR PARTIES.\n>> DO YOU KNOW WHEN YOUR MEDICAL RECORDS ARE GOING TO -- THE REST\nTHAT YOU SAID YOU'LL RELEASE BECAUSE HE SAYS HE'S RELEASING\nSOME SOON. DO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO\nRELEASE THE REST OF YOURS OR MORE INFORMATION?\n>> MORE INFORMATION I THINK WILL BE VERY SHORTLY.\nBECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE REALLY WANT TO RESPOND TO LEGITIMATE\nQUESTIONS THAT PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE.\nI'M VERY TOUCHED BY THE CONCERN THAT'S BEEN SET FORTH ABOUT MY\nHEALTH. I'M REALLY GLAD THAT I DID\nFINALLY FOLLOW MY DOCTOR'S ORDERS AND TAKE SOME DAYS TO\nREST. POWERING THROUGH.RYING TO KEEP -\nWHICH I THINK IS COMMON EXPERIENCE FOR PEOPLE.\nSO WE'RE GOING TO PUT OUT MORE INFORMATION, AND THAT WILL BE\nTHEN, TWICE AS MUCH AS HE PUT OUT.\nAND WE'LL SEE WHAT, IF ANYTHING, HE'S WILLING TO DISCLOSE.\n>> SECRETARY HILLARY CLINTON, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A BREAK, AND\nTHEN WE'LL COME BACK. >> DISCLOSURE TRANSPARENCY.\nBIG WORDS COMING UP HERE. LET'S BRING IN DON LEMON ALSO\nJOINING US CNN'S CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT DR. SANJAY GUPTA.\nWE'LL TALK HEALTH. WE'LL TALK THE POLITICS HERE.\nSHE WAS VERY DIRECTED IN HER ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS DON,\nWHAT DID YOU PICK UP? >> FIRST BEFORE WE GET THERE\nBECAUSE I HAVE SANJAY HERE. WHEN SHE STARTED TALKING THE\nFIRST THING I NOTICED WAS THAT SHE DIDN'T SOUND THE WAY SHE\nSOUNDED THIS WEEKEND IN THE INTERVIEW WITH ANDERSON, RIGHT?\nSHE SOUNDED LIKE, HI DON! THIS IS THE ANSWER TO MY\nQUESTION, I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS DELIBERATE BUT SHE DID SOUND\nSTRONGER AND EVERYONE WHO IS ON THE TOM JOYNER MORNING SHOW SAID\nYOU DO SOUND STRONGER. THAT WAS RECORDED YESTERDAY.\nBUT SHE SEEMED TO, YOU KNOW, INTIMATE THAT SHE'S GOING TO\nRELEASE MORE RECORDS AS SHE DID YESTERDAY A DOCTOR'S LETTER.\nBUT I'M WONDERING FROM SANJAY WHAT ELSE CAN SHE RELEASE?\nIS THERE MORE? >> THE BIG QUESTION HAS BEEN,\nLOOK, ARE YOU GOING TO RELEASE RECORDS?\nARE YOU GOING TO RELEASE ESSENTIALLY WHAT IS A SUMMY DONE\nBY SOMEONE'S INTERPRETATION OF THOSE RECORDS WHO HAPPENS TO BE\nSOMEONE WHO YOU'RE COLLEGIAL WITH.\nYOUR DOCTOR/FRIEND SORT OF PERSON.\nAGAIN IT'S NOT TO SUGGEST THAT'S WHAT'S IN THOSE SUMMARIES IS\nINACCURATE BUT SOMETIMES THE REASON YOU LOOK AT MEDICAL\nRECORDS, BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW.\nYOU DON'T KNOW -- AND SO THERE ARE CERTAIN QUESTIONS THAT COME\nUP. FIRST OF ALL, TO ANSWER YOUR\nQUESTION, I DOUBT WE'RE GOING TO SEE ANYTHING MORE.\nI DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE ANYTHING MORE FROM HER --\n>> RAW DATA. >> RAW DATA.\n>> I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.\nBUT THAT'S BEEN SORT OF THE BIG QUESTION, BASICALLY THEY'VE MET\nTHE STANDARD THAT OTHER CAMPAIGNS HAVE HAD IN TERMS OF\nWHAT THEY HAVE -- >> EXCEPT JOHN McCAIN THEY\nREALLY HAVE. >> BUT YOU KNOW THE IDEA OF\nRELEASING MEDICAL RECORDS AND LETTING SOMEONE INDEPENDENT LOOK\nAT THOSE THINGS AND JUST MAKING SURE THAT ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT\nDETERMINE IF SOMEONE'S FIT TO LEAD ARE ANSWERED.\n>> LET'S BRING IN DAVID GREGORY, CNN'S POLITICAL ANALYST.\nDAVID, WHAT DID YOU HEAR IN DON'S INTERVIEW?\nI MEAN SHE TOUCHED A LOT OF BASES.\nSHE TALKED ABOUT RUSSIA, SHE TALKED ABOUT TAXES, SHE TALKED\nABOUT COLIN POWELL. WHAT DID YOU HEAR?\n>> WELL I WANT TO COME BACK TO RUSSIA IN JUST A SECOND.\nSANJAY SAID SOMETHING EARLIER THAT I THINK IS REALLY\nIMPORTANT. I THINK YOU WANT AS MUCH\nINFORMATION AS YOU CAN GET, AND TO YOUR POINT, ALISYN, YOU MAY\nNOT WANT, I HAVE IMAGES HERE OF MY MEDICAL RESULTS.\nSHALL WE SHOW THEM? >> NO, THANK YOU.\n>> I KNOW. BUT THE POINT IS, TO SANJAY'S\nPOINT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO DO ALL THAT BUT YOU WANT\nSOMEBODY WHO IS INDEPENDENT WHO CAN DO THIS KIND OF REVIEW.\nMcCAIN IS DIFFERENT. HE HAD CANCER.\nHE HAD MELANOMA. BUT I THINK MORE INFORMATION IS\nBETTER THAN LESS. I KEEP GETTING CAUGHT UP IN\nHILLARY CLINTON'S ARGUMENT THAT SHE WANTS TO BE COMPARED TO\nDONALD TRUMP. THAT'S NOT THE STANDARD.\nHIS DISCLOSURES ARE INSUFFICIENT.\nI THINK THAT CAN BE SAID OBJECTIVELY BASED ON PRECEDENT\nIN A PRESIDENTIAL RUN. BUT SHE SHOULD BE STILL\nRELEASING MORE, AND THE -- SHE SHOULD BE COMPARED TO WHAT IS\nREASONABLE IN THIS REGARD. AND AS MUCH AS YOU CAN PUT OUT\nIS APPROPRIATE AND SHOULD BE INDEPENDENTLY REVIEWED BY PEOPLE\nLIKE DR. GUPTA, AND OTHERS WHO HAVE DONE IT IN THE PAST WHO CAN\nMAKE A JUDGMENT. THE RUSSIA PIECE IS INTERESTING\nBECAUSE I THINK IT'S VERY GOOD POLITICS.\nIT HAPPENS TO BE REALLY FRIGHTENING THAT RUSSIA IS GOING\nTO THE LENGTHS THAT IT'S GOING TO POTENTIALLY INFLUENCE THE\nELECTION. TO HACK TOP PEOPLE IN THE\nCOUNTRY IN POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY, TO HACK THEIR\nE-MAILS. THAT SHOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT\nCONCERN. JUST AS CYBER TERROR AND CYBER\nCRIME SHOULD BE A CONCERN MORE GENERALLY IN OUR NATIONAL\nSECURITY. >> THERE'S ANOTHER PART OF THE\nINTERVIEW THAT AIRS. IT'S PROBABLY AIRING NOW BECAUSE\nTHEY TOOK A BREAK IN -- WHERE SHE TALKS ABOUT HER DEPLORABLES\nCOMMENT WHERE SHE DOUBLED DOWN ON THE HATE AND THE ALT-RIGHT\nAND WHAT SHE THIS DONALD TRUMP IS ATTRACTING --\n>> SHE'S NOT APOLOGIZING -- >> SHE'S NOT APOLOGIZING.\nSHE IN FACT USED THE WORD DEPLORABLE HERSELF.\nSHE SAID I HAVE CRITICIZED HIS DEPLORABLE -- I HAVE CRITICIZED\nHIS DEPLORABLE CAMPAIGN. SHE'S DOUBLING DOWN ON THAT --\n>> IT'S THE 50% SHE SAID SHE OVERREACHED.\n>> I THINK SHE'S PUSHING BACK BECAUSE SHE THIS SHE'S RIGHT ON\nTHIS ISSUE. AND I THINK SHE -- PEOPLE WERE A\nLITTLE BIT UPSET THAT THEY YOU KNOW SHE APPEARED TO BACK DOWN A\nLITTLE BIT. SO SHE DID DISCUSS THAT.\nBUT SHE KEEPS PUSHING TRANSPARENCY, RUSSIA, DONALD\nTRUMP IS NOT TRANSPARENT AS SHE IS, RUSSIA OR AT ALL SHE DOESN'T\nBELIEVE LESS SO THAN ANY OTHER CANDIDATE AND SHE IS NOT AGAIN\nNOT BACKING DOWN REALLY DOUBLING DOWN ON THE HATRED THAT SHE\nBELIEVES HE'S STIRRING UP -- >> THAT'S DIFFERENT.\nTHE DEPLORABLES IS ABOUT HIS OWN CAMPAIGN AND WHAT HE HAS SAID IS\nDIFFERENT THAN WHAT SHE SAID ABOUT HIS SUPPORTERS.\nI MEAN THAT'S WHERE PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WENT A BRIDGE TOO\nFAR. DID SHE SAY ANYTHING ABOUT HIS\nSUPPORTERS OR WAS SHE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN HE'S\nRUNNING? >> SHE SAID HIS CAMPAIGN.\nSHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT HIS SUPPORTERS.\n>> I THINK THAT'S DIFFERENT. >> IT'S ALWAYS BAD AS YOU KNOW,\nCOMING FROM A POLITICAL FAMILY, TO YOU KNOW, SAY BAD THINGS\nABOUT VOTERS EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT YOUR SUPPORTERS.\n>> YOU DON'T ATTACK -- >> ATTACK A CAMPAIGN BUT NOT THE\nVOTERS. >> JUST A HUMAN BEING, WHEN YOU\nATTACK SOMEBODY'S SUPPORT BASE IN ANYTHING YOU'RE MAKING A\nMISTAKE. ESPECIALLY WHAT WE'VE SEEN\nLEARNED IN THE PRIMARIES HERE THAT WHEN YOU DISRESPECT TRUMP,\nTHAT'S OKAY IF IT'S ON THE MERITS.\nWHEN YOU DISRESPECT PEOPLE FOR BELIEVING AND WANTING CHANGE AND\nBEING ANGRY ABOUT STATUS QUO YOU WIND UP BEING --\n>> I ALSO SPOKE WITH HER ABOUT THE POLLS AND SHE SAID YOU KNOW,\nSTANDARD ANSWER, I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THIS CAMPAIGN WAS GOING\nTO BE CLOSE. THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.\nBUT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT HILLARY CLINTON YOU KNOW\nHISTORY, HER RESUME, WHAT SHE'S DONE, HOW LONG SHE'S BEEN AROUND\nI MEAN YOU KNOW OBJECTIVELY YOU SHOULD SAY SHE SHOULD BE FURTHER\nAHEAD IN THE POLLS. IN A POLITICAL --\n>> EXCEPT THE GOP THIS IS THEIR RACE TO WIN.\n>> YEAH. >> CYCLICALLY THIS IS THEIR RACE\nTO WIN AND MANY ARGUE SHE'S -- >> HERTZ TO LOSE.\n>> THAT'S RIGHT. WELL THAT WAS THE PRESUMPTION\nNOW IN THIS PERIOD, IT CAN GO EITHER WAY.\nAND MANY PEOPLE SUGGEST YEAH SHE SHOULD BE BEATING TRUMP BECAUSE\nOF HER RESUME BUT IF SHE'D BEEN RUNNING AGAINST A JOHN KASICH\nSHE MAY HAVE HAD MORE THAN SHE COULD HANDLE WELL BEFORE THIS\nPOINT. >> EXACTLY.\n>> DAVID, WHAT ARE -- >> I'M JUST LOOKING AT OUR\nBANNER WHEN SHE SAYS THAT SHE ALWAYS KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE A\nCLOSE RACE. NO THAT'S NOT TRUE.\nI WAS LOOKING AT VIDEOTAPE JUST EARLIER ON YOUTUBE ABOUT SHE AND\nOTHERS IN THE MEDIA SAYING THAT TRUMP WAS -- WAS A JOKE THAT HE\nWASN'T A SERIOUS CANDIDATE. SO YOU CAN'T SAY YOU ALWAYS\nTHOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE CLOSE.\nAND THE REALITY IS IN GOING AFTER SOME OF HIS SUPPORTERS,\nSOME OF WHICH IS CERTAINLY ACCURATE IN TERMS OF THE VIEWS\nOF SOME OF HIS SUPPORTERS, WHETHER THEY'RE ANTI-SEMITIC OR\nRACIST OR HOMOPHOBIC OR ISLAMAPHOBIC, THAT IS JUST TRUE.\nAND THE TRUTH IS THAT TRUMP HAS NOT STOOD UP TO SOME OF THOSE\nPEOPLE. ANTI-SEMITES, FOR EXAMPLE, GIVEN\nTHE FACT THAT HE HAS A JEWISH GRANDSON, AND HAS NOT STOOD UP\nTO THOSE PEOPLE WITHIN HIS OWN CAMPAIGN.\nSO, SHE'S GOT REASON TO DO THAT BUT THE POINT IS, IT'S GLOSSING\nOVER THE FACT WHEN SHE MADE A COMMENT LIKE THAT --\n>> HE HAS A JEWISH DAUGHTER. SHE CONVERTED.\n>> PRECISELY. -- AND AS YOU KNOW I MEAN\nCONVERTS IN THE JEWISH HELD UP ABOVE ALL IN THE BIBLE.\nBUT THE POINT IS THERE ARE CERTAINLY THERE ARE FACTORS HERE\nABOUT THE SUPPORT FOR TRUMP THAT GO WELL BEYOND THAT.\nAND OF COURSE NOBODY LIKES TO BELIEVE ABOUT THEMSELVES THAT\nTHEY MAY BE BIASED OR RACIST, OR IN ANY WAY AND SO THAT'S WHY\nTHAT JUST KIND OF MISSED THE MARK ON HER POINT OF WHAT SHE\nWAS TRYING TO SAY. >> WE HAVE THAT PART DAVID LET'S\nLISTEN TO IT. >> DONALD TRUMP HAS RUN A\nDEPLORABLE CAMPAIGN. HE HAS ACCEPTED SUPPORT AND BEEN\nCHEERED ON BY THE LIKES OF DAVID DUKE, THE FORMER GRAND WIZARD OF\nTHE KU KLUX KLAN AND OTHER WHITE SUPREMACISTS.\nIN FACT, IT WAS AMAZING THE OTHER DAY HIS RUNNING MATE, MIKE\nPENCE, WOULDN'T EVEN CALL FORMER KKK LEADER DAVID DUKE\nDEPLORABLE. AND, AND I DO THINK WE HAVE TO\nSPEAK OUT AGAINST THIS HATRED. YOU KNOW TRUMP ATTACKED A\nFEDERAL JUDGE FOR HIS MEXICAN HERITAGE.\nHE -- HE BULLIED A GOLD STAR FAMILY BECAUSE OF THEIR MUSLIM\nFAITH. HE PROMOTED THE LIE, AND HE\nSTILL IS PROMOTING THE LIE, THAT OUR FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT IS NOT\nA TRUE AMERICAN. >> HMM.\n>> HE CALLS WOMEN PIGS AND BIMBOS.\nSO, -- >> YEAH.\nAND IT'S TRUE AND THAT'S YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK THAT MAYBE\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS A LITTLE BIT TONE DEAF THEY THEY AT LEAST\nTHEY SAY THAT THEY DON'T THINK THAT THE BIRTHER THING IS A BIG\nDEAL AND WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE JOBS AND\nWHATEVER. OF COURSE THAT'S IMPORTANT.\nBUT, BY DOING WHAT DONALD TRUMP DID WITH THE BIRTHER THING,\nTAKING IT BEYOND WHEREVER IT STARTED, SENDING PEOPLE TO\nAFRICA, INVESTIGATORS AT LEAST HIM SAYING THAT, DOUBLING AND\nTRIPLING DOWN ON THAT, AND THEN SAYING HE DIDN'T BELIEVE THE\nBIRTH CERTIFICATE WAS ACCURATE. THAT INSULTED 99.999% OF\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS. HE MAY NOT SEE IT AS RACIAL.\nMAYBE THAT WAS NOT HIS INTENT. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT -- I DO\nBELIEVE THAT THAT WAS -- THAT WAS THE RESULT, WHETHER OR NOT\nTHAT WAS HIS OBVIOUS INTENT. AND SO THAT'S INSULTING TO\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS AND HE STILL HAS YET TO APOLOGIZE FOR THAT\nAND I THINK THAT IS GOING TO HURT HIM WHEN IT COMES TO BLACK\nSUPPORT. >> HE APPARENTLY STILL BELIEVES\nIT. HE NOT ONLY HAS APOLOGIZED\nTHERE'S NO INDICATION THAT HE DOESN'T STILL BELIEVE THAT.\n>> RUDY GIULIANI AND HIS SURROGATES SAY HE BELIEVES THE\nPRESIDENT WAS BORN IN THE UNITED STATES BUT HE HAS YET TO SAY\nTHAT -- >> RIGHT.\n>> THE POINT IS THAT I THINK DON AS YOU POINT OUT THIS WAS ABSURD\nTHAT HE EVER WOULD ADVANCE THIS NOTION AND HE WANTS TO BE\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME, YOU'RE\nINTERVIEW WITH HILLARY CLINTON AND WHAT SHE SAID HOW SHE BROKE\nDOWN THOSE EXAMPLES THEY'VE GOT AN AD UP I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S IN\nTHE BATTLEGROUNDS, IT WAS CERTAINLY ON NATIONAL CABLE I\nSAW IT ON OUR AIR IN WHICH SHE TAKE HIS CRITICISM OF HER, THAT\nSHE'S INSULTED YOU KNOW SEGMENTS OF THE ELECTORATE, WHICH SHE DID\nIN THAT BASKET OF DEPLORABLES REMARK, AND THEN SHOWS ALL OF\nTHE EXAMPLES THAT SHE LISTED TO YOU AND SAYS, RIGHT, WE AGREE\nWITH HIM EXACTLY YOU SHOULDN'T DO THAT.\nSO I THINK SHE'S WILLING TO TAKE HER LUMPS, THAT THIS WAS\nSOMETHING THAT SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID.\nSHE OFFENDED SOME PEOPLE. BUT, YOU KNOW, WHETHER IT HAD\nSOME RESONANCE IN THE POLLS AGAINST HER WE'RE GOING TO FIND\nOUT. BUT SHE'S TRYING TO COUNTERPUNCH\nHERE BY BRINGING UP ALL THESE AREAS WHERE HE SAID AND BELIEVED\nWHAT HE BELIEVES. >> DAVID, SANJAY, DON, THANK YOU\nDON THANKS SO FOR SHARING THAT INTERVIEW WITH US.\nALL RIGHT THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION AND CLINTON FOUNDATION UNDER THE\nMICROSCOPE TODAY SO WE'RE TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT BOTH OF THEM\nTHIS MORNING STARTING WITH WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN TO DONALD TRUMP'S\nORGANIZATION IF HE IS ELECTED PRESIDENT.\nWE DISCUSS THAT NEXT.",

AN INCREASE, SAY, OF A HALF A\nPOINT IN MORTGAGE RATES. WHO DOES IT HURT MORE?\n>> IT HURTS THE LOWER END MORE BECAUSE IT COMES DOWN TO\nAFFORDABILITY. IT COMES DOWN TO DOLLARS AND\nCENTS OF WHAT THEY CAN AFFORD IN A GIVEN MONTH.\nDO THEY CONTINUE TO RENT, OR IS THE RATE SUCH THAT THEY CAN\nAFFORD TO OWN? OUR BUYERS DON'T MAX OUT THEIR\nMORTGAGES.

              "text": "SHIP ONCOLOGY DRUG FAILED TO\nMEET ITS PRIMARY END POINT IN A CLINICAL TRIAL FOR ADVANCED\nNON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER, AND THAT IS A GIGANTIC END MARK.\nSO THIS NEWS WAS A HUGE SET BACK FOR THE COMPANY'S MOST IMPORTANT\nDRUG. IT PARTICULARLY LED TO A SLEW OF\nANALYSTS DOWN GRADES. BUT BRISTOL-MYERS IS A MASSIVE\nDRUG COMPANY WITH LOTS OF PRODUCTS IN THE PIPE.\nSO THEN WHY DID THIS ONE BUSTED TRIAL DO SO MUCH DAMAGE?\nUNTIL WE GOT THIS SUB PAR DATA, BRISTOL-MYERS WAS WIDELY\nREGARDED IN THE CANCER IMMUNOTHERAPY SPACE.\nOPP TEVA IS ALREADY COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE AND AND OPP DIVA'S\nGROWTH HAS BEEN EXPLOSIVE. LAST YEAR IN GENERATED A BILLION\nDOLLARS IN SALES AND IT'S JUST THE -- AS SOON AS WE LEARNED\nTHIS DRUG FAILED TO MEET ITS PRIMARY END POINTS IN THAT LUNG\nCANCER TRIAL, WALL STREET SUDDENLY SOURED ON THE ENTIRE\nFRANCHISE, ASSUMING PEOPLE WOULD SWITCH TO A COMPETITOR, AND\nTHAT'S THE DRUG KEYTRUDA THAT MERCK MAKES.\nHOWEVER, THE REALITY IS FAR MU NUANCED.\nTHE REASON THIS DRUG FAILED TO HIT ITS END POINTS IS BECAUSE\nBRISZ TOLL MEYERS SENT THE BAR TO HIGH WHEN THEY SET THE\nCLINICAL TRIAL. OPP TEVA OPERATES ON A\nPARTICULAR PROTEIN BUT WHEN THEY SET UP THE STUDY, THEY INCLUDED\nANY PATIENTS WHO EXPRESSED THAT -- BRIGS TOLL MEYERS WANTED\nTO SHOW THAT OPP TEVA WOULD BE EFFECTIVE FOR EVERY LUNG CANCER\nPATIENT, BUT EVEN IF THEY SET THE THRESHOLD AT 50%, IT WOULD\nHAVE DEMONSTRATED THE DRUG COULD BE EFFECTIVE FOR A HUGE NUMBER\nOF PATIENTS. BECAUSE THEY SET THEIR SIGHTS SO\nHIGH, THEY GOT BURNED. SO THEN WHY CIRCLE BACK TO\nBRISTOL-MYERS NOW? I MEAN ISN'T IT JUST LEFT FOR\nDEAD? REMEMBER, THE STOCK LOST\n$20 BILLION OF VALUE THE FIRST DAY AFTER THE NEWS BROKE AND\nSINCE THEN IT'S ONLY GONE LOWER. WE'RE ONLY TALKING ABOUT A\n$5 BILLION STROKE, RIGHT? $5 BILLION IN LOST SALES.\nBIG, BUT NOT $20 BILLION IN MARKET CUT BIG.\nAT THE MOST BASIC LEVEL WE'VE BEEN BUYING BRISTOL-MYERS\nBECAUSE THE PENDULUM HAS SWUNG FROM OPDIVO ESTIMATES BEING TOO\nHIGH TO THEM NOW BEING TOO LOW. NOW THAT ANALYSTS HAVE\nCOMPLETELY STRIPPED 9 NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER NUMBERS FROM\nTHEIR FORECAST, IT'S JUST WAY TOO MUCH NEGATIVITY BAKED IN.\nAS THE COMPANY POINTED OUT, THEY'VE STILL GOT A NON-SMALL\nCELL LUNG CANCER TRIAL GOING PAIRING OPDIVO WITH ANOTHER ONE\nOF THEIR DRUGS. IF THAT TRIAL GOES WELL, THE\nESTIMATES WILL NEED TO GO HIGHERMENT REMEMBER, EVEN WITH\nLAST MONTH'S SETBACK, OPDIVO ALREADY HAS FDA APPROVAL FOR A\nHOST OF DIFFERENT CANCERS. I DON'T THINK THE STRENGTH OF\nTHIS DRUG WILL BE TOTALLY DIMINISHED JUST BECAUSE IT DID\nPOORLY IN A SINGLE POORLY DESIGNED BY THE COMPANY STUDY.\nTHE FACT IS BRISTOL-MYERS REMAINS A MAJOR PLAYER IN THE\nHOTTEST SUBSET OF ONCOLOGY, WHICH IS THE CANCER\nIMMUNOTHERAPY MARKET. THIS IS A CLASSIC BIG PHARMA\nCOMPANY WITH A HOST OF DIFFERENT DRUGS FOR A VARIETY OF DISEASES\nFROM CANCER TO IMMUNE CONDITIONS TO CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES AND\nNUROLOGIST AND THEY'VE GOT A ROBUST NEW PIPELINE EVEN AFTER\nTAKING THE OPDIVO CUTS INTO ACCOUNT.\nTHE STOCK YIELDS 2.75% AND EVEN IF THE FED TIGHTENS NEXT WEEK,\nTHAT'S LIKELY TO BE BETTER THAN YOU'D GET FROM THE TEN YEAR\nTREASURY. I THINK BRISTOL-MYERS REPRESENTS\nTREMENDOUS VALUE AT THESE LEVELS.\nONE BIG CAVEAT. BRISTOL-MYERS IS NOW A VALUE\nINVESTMENT AND THAT REQUIRES A LONG-TERM TIME HORIZON.\nIT COULD TAKE A YEAR, TWO YEARS FOR THE STORY TO PLAY OUT.\nSHORT TERM THINGS COULD REMAIN CHOPPY AND THERE'S NO REASON IT\nK7B9 GO STILL LOWER. I LIKE IT INTO ANY ADDITIONAL\nWEAKNESS. AS WE TOLD SUBSCRIBERS, WE'LL\nPATIENTLY BUY MORE BRISTOL-MYERS ON THE WAY DOWN.\nSO HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE. IN THIS NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR\nTHE DRUG INDUSTRY, I THINK BRISTOL-MYERS HAS FINALLY COME\nDOWN TO THE POINT WHERE IT'S SIMPLY TOO AFRACKTIVE TO IGNORE\nAS A LONG-TERM INVESTMENT. SURE, IT'S NOT FLYING HIGH RIGHT\nNOW. BUT BRISTOL STOCK HAS BEEN\nHAMMERED BEFORE, AND IT'S ALWAYS >>> BOY, IT IS TOUGH TO OWN A\nRETAIL STOCK THESE DAYS. >> THE HOUSE OF PAIN.\n>> LATELY IT FEELS LIKE THE WHOLE GROUP HAS FALLEN OUT OF\nFAVOR IN THE WALL STREET FASHION SHOW, WHICH HAS A WHOLE\nDIFFERENT AESTHETIC FROM FASHION WEEK.\nHERE'S THE THING. THE CONSUMER DISCREASARY\nCATEGORY MAKES UP A LITTLE OVER 12% OF THE S&P 500.\nMOST OF THAT BEING RETAIL. WHY DOES THAT MATTER TO YOU?\nBECAUSE THERE ARE TONS OF HEDGE FUNDS AND MUTUAL FUNDS OUT THERE\nTHAT DON'T FEEL SAFE UNLESS THEY'RE MIRRORING THE SECTOR\nRATING OF THE S&P 500. BASICALLY THEY OPERATE LIKE AN\nINDEX PHONE WITH A BRAIN. THAT WAY YOU'RE MUCH LESS LIKELY\nTO -- >> IN SHORT THANKS TO WHAT I\nCALL THE MECHANICS OF MONEY MANAGEMENT, MANY OF THESE FUNDS\nHAVE A LOT OF CASH THAT THEY NEED TO INVEST IN SOME SORT OF\nRETAILER. IN ONLY THEY COULD CONTINUE TO\nMIRRORING THE SECTOR MAKEUP OF THE S&P 500.\nTHIS MAY SOUND LIKE A CRAZY WAY TO INVEST, BUT IT'S HOW A LOT OF\nTHESE GUYS OPERATE. JUST LOOK AT THE HEALTH CARE\nSECTOR. THE BROADER SEC TORE HAS BEEN A\nDOG ALL YEAR, RIGHT? BUT THE MEDICAL DEVICE STOCKS\nHAVE ROARED HIGHER BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONE SEGMENT OF THE\nHEALTH CARE COHORT THAT'S ACTUALLY DOING WELL AND IS NOT\nIN THE CROSSHAIRS OF THE POLITICIANS.\nSO ALL THE HEDGE FUNDS AND MUTUAL FUNDS WHO NEED HEALTH\nCARE EXPOSURE PUL INTO THE MEDICAL DEVICE STOCKS LIKE\nBOSTON SCIENTIFIC, WHOSE CEO WE HEARD FROM JUST LAST NIGHT.\nMORE ON THAT LATER. RIGHT NOW, THOUGH, IT'S RETAIL\nTHAT'S IN THE DOG HOUSE. BUT WE KNOW THAT BASKETS OF\nMONEY ALLOCATED FOR RETAIL STOCKS NEED TO GO SOMEWHERE.\nTHEY NEED A NAME IS WHAT WE WOULD SAY ON THE DESK, WHICH\nBRINGS ME TO FOOT LOCKER. YES, FOOT LOCKER, THE HUGE\nATHLETIC APPAREL CHAIN. EVEN THOUGH IT'S PULLED BACK A\nFEW BUCKS IN RECENT WEEKS, I THINK FOOTLOCKER IS EXACTLY THE\nKIND OF RETAILER THAT THE BIG BOYS WILL FEEL COMFORTABLE\nBUYING IN ORDER TO GET THE RETAIL EXPOSURE THAT THEY NEED\nTO HAVE. WHAT MAKES ME SAY THIS?\nOKAY. THE LAST TIME I TALKED TO YOU\nABOUT FOOT LOCKER WAS IN EARLY JUNE WHEN THE COMPANY HAD JUST\nSTUMBLED. AFTER A TWO YEAR WINNING STREAK\nWHERE THEY ONLY DELIVERED KNOCKOUT NUMBERS.\nTHE STOCK HAD GOTTEN SLAMMED AND INVESTORS WERE WRITING THIS ONE\nOFF. THEY DECIDED TO FORGET ABOUT\nFOOT LOCKER. STILL ONE MORE VICTIM, OF\nCOURSE, OF THE DEATH OF THE SHOPPING MALL.\nBUT I TOLD YOU NOT TO BE DISHEARTENED BY ONE MISSED\nQUARTER. IN PART THAT'S BECAUSE THERE\nWERE MITD GATING CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE THE LIQUIDATION OF SPORTS\nAUTHORITY, A MAJOR COMPETITOR THAT AT THE TIME WAS FURIOUSLY\nDUMPING ITS MERCHANDISE AT FIRE SALE PRICES BEFORE CLOSING ALL\nOF ITS STORES. I ALSO WOINTED OUT THAT ONCE\nSPORTS AUTHORITY HAD FINISHED LIQUID ATDING, THEIR MARKET\nSHARE WOULD BE UP FOR GRABS AND BEYOND THAT FOOT LOCKER HAD A\nLOT GOING FOR IT, INCLUDING A MIDGE STORE INNOVATION PLAN.\nBEST OF ALL, I LIKED THAT THE STOCK WAS DIRT CHEAP, TRADING AT\nMERELY 10.7 TIMES NEXT YEAR'S EARNING ESTIMATES.\nSOLID EXECUTION. THAT'S WHY I SAID FOOT LOCKER\nLOOKED LIKE A STEAL BACK AT THE BEGINNING OF JUNE WHEN IT WAS AT\n$55. SURE ENOUGH, IT DIDN'T TAKE VERY\nLONG FOR FOOT LOCKER TO COME",

THE SECOND THING I THINK THEY\nNEED TO DO IS STABILIZE THEIR EARNINGS AND PART OF THAT WILL\nCOME FROM PAUL HAIR, WHO I HAVE WORKED WITH THROUGH TWO\nCOMPANIES THAT I COVERED AND HE'S BEEN ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY\nDO THAT FOR THOSE ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL.\nAND THEN I THINK THE THIRD THING IS THEY HAVE A GREAT BRANDED\nDRUG PIPELINE THEY HAVE BEEN EXECUTING ON AND GETTING\nPRODUCTS APPROVED AND NO ONE IS GIVING THEM ANY CREDIT HERE.\nAND THEY HAVE TWO BIG PRODUCTS COMING UP FOR APPROVAL THROUGH\nTHE END OF THE YEAR AND NEXT YEAR WHICH COULD BE BLOCKBUSTER\nDRUGS TO THE COMPANY. >> LIKE THE NEW MANAGEMENT?\n>> I DO LIKE THE NEW MANAGEMENT TEAM.\nI WORKED WITH BOTH OF THEM BEFORE AND OTHER COMPANIES THAT\nTHEY HAVE BEEN SENIOR EXECUTIVES FOR AND THEY HAVE DONE A GREAT\nJOB TO TURN AROUND OR ENHANCE THE ORGANIZATIONS.\n>> WHAT DO YOU NEED TO SEE HAPPEN IN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS TO\nMAKE YOU BELIEVE THAT 25% COULD BE CONSERVATIVE?\n>> SO I THINK WHAT THEY NEED TO DO IS PAUL HAIR, HE'S NEW TO THE\nORGANIZATION, HE'S BEEN THERE FOR SEVEN OR EIGHT DAYS, BUT A\nVERY EXPERIENCED CFO THAT HAS GOOD COMMUNICATION SKILLS.\nI THINK HE NEEDS TO GIVE PEOPLE CONFIDENCE IN WHAT THE NUMBERS\nWILL BE. I KNOW THERE IS SOME\nANTICIPATION BECAUSE HE'S LOOKING AT 16, 17, AND BEYOND\nNUMBERS AND WHERE HE MIGHT COME OUT WITH THAT.\nAND GIVEN THE FACT THAT VALEANT HAS HAD A COUPLE OF DOWNWARD\nEARNINGS REVISIONS, YOU KNOW, I THINK PEOPLE ARE WORRIED AHEAD\nOF THAT. I HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE IN\nPAUL THAT HE'LL PUT OUT NUMBERS THAT THEY CAN MEET OR BEAT.\nTHAT'S FIRST AND FOREMOST. I THINK THE SECOND THING HERE IS\nTO SHOW SOME EVIDENCE OF THE DIVESTITURE OF THE NONCORE\nASSETS AND GIVE PEOPLE CONFIDENCE THEY CAN SELL THE\nASSETS FOR SOMETHING WORTHWHILE. I THINK SKEPTICISM IS THAT, YOU\nKNOW, THEY OVERPAID FOR THESE AND THEY DID IT UNDER A\nBENEFITED TAX STRUCTURE, SO IF THEY TRY TO SELL THESE, MAYBE\nTHEY WON'T GET WHAT THEY PAID FOR.\n>> WE'LL LEAVE IT THERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR\nTIME. LOUISE CHEN OF GUGGENHEIM\nSECURITIES. >>> QUICKLY, I DID SOMETHING ON\nTHE BACK OF VALEANT I PROMISED I WOULD NEVER DO, MATH.\nI LOOKED AT 25% A YEAR, WHERE WOULD THAT PUT INVESTORS IF YOU\nBOUGHT IT TODAY. IF YOU BELIEVE BILL MILL, 25%\nGAINS, 34, 30 A SHARE, BY THE END OF 2021, FIVE YEARS, 25%\nBRAND OF RETURN, YOU WOULD HAVE A SHARE PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY\n$84 BASED ON WHERE IT IS TODAY. IT WAS A $257 STOCK IN JULY OF\nLAST YEAR. SO YOU'RE STILL DOWN 67% IF YOU\nBOUGHT AT THE PEAK. NO ONE WILL KNOCK 25% RETURNS.\nIT SOUNDS GREAT. BUT YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORICAL\nCONTEXT OF THE STOCK, IT DOESN'T EVEN REALLY GET YOU A THIRD OF\nTHE WAY BACK TO WHERE IT WAS. >> UP NEXT, TWO BIG REASONS WHY\nTIM COOK IS DANCING TODAY. \"POWER LUNCH\" WILL BE RIGHT\nBACK.",

THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN TRUE.\nTHIS MORNING WE HEARD FROM BOTH CANDIDATES, AND THERE ARE LOTS\nOF HEADLINES ABOUT THEM. THE ORGANIZATION SHARING THEIR\nNAME. ESPECIALLY LET'S TALK ABOUT THE\nIMPACT WITH DAVID GREGORY CNN'S POLITICAL ANALYST.\nWE HAVE SOME SOUND FROM HILLARY CLINTON'S INTERVIEW WITH DON\nLEMON AND THE CAST OF THE TOM JOYNER RADIO SHOW.\nLET'S PLAY WHAT SEEMED TO BE HER PUNCTUATION MARK.\n>> I AM SO CONCERNED ABOUT ALL OF THIS, AND YOU KNOW, I HAVE\nSAID DONALD TRUMP HAS RUN A DEPLORABLE CAMPAIGN.\nHE HAS ACCEPTED SUPPORT AND BEEN CHEERED ON BY THE LIKES OF DAVID\nDUKE, THE FORMER GRAND WIZARD OF THE KU KLUX KLAN AND OTHER WHITE\nSUPREMACISTS. IN FACT IT WAS AMAZING THE OTHER\nDAY, HIS RUNNING MATE, MIKE PENCE, WOULDN'T EVEN CALL FORMER\nKKK LEADER DAVID DUKE DEPLORABLE.\nAND I DO THINK WE HAVE TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST THIS HATRED.\nYOU KNOW, TRUMP ATTACKED A FEDERAL JUDGE FOR HIS MEXICAN\nHERITAGE. HE BULLIED A GOLD STAR FAMILY\nBECAUSE OF THEIR MUSLIM FAITH. HE PROMOTED THE LIE, AND HE\nSTILL IS REMOTING THE LIE, THAT OUR FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT IS NOT\nA TRUE AMERICAN. >> HMM.\n>> HE CALLS WOMEN PIGS AND BIMBOS.\nSO, I'M GOING TO KEEP CALLING OUT THE BIGOTR AND HATEFUL\nRHETORIC THAT HE'S BROUGHT TO THIS CAMPAIGN BECAUSE I DON'T\nTHINK YOU CAN MAKE OUR COUNTRY GREAT BY TEARING OUR PEOPLE\nDOWN. >> NOW, DAVID, YOU CAN DEBATE\nHOW MUCH HAS BEEN DONE ON COVERAGE OF TRUMP.\nTHAT'S FOR PEOPLE TO DECIDE. HOWEVER, THE POLLS ARE WHERE\nTHEY ARE. DOES THAT TELL YOU THAT PEOPLE\nWHO KNOW STILL DON'T CARE? >> WELL, I THINK THERE'S AN\nELEMENT OF THAT. I MEAN I DON'T KNOW THAT WE CAN\nBACK THAT UP BY THE DATA. BUT I DO THINK JUST -- LOOK\nANYBODY LOOKS AT A POLITICIAN AND SAYS LOOK I DON'T AGREE WITH\nEVERYTHING BUT I STILL SUPPORT THEM.\nI THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WILLFULLY IGNORE CERTAIN THINGS\nTHAT TRUMP SAYS AND FOCUS ON WHAT THEY LIKE ABOUT HIM.\nI THINK THAT'S TRUE. I THINK HILLARY CLINTON IS IN A\nPOSTURE AND YOU SAW IT IN THAT ANSWER WHICH I THOUGHT WAS\nREVEALING. FIRST OF ALL SHE WANTS TO\nSIDESTEP THE FACT THAT SHE DID IMPUGN A LOT OF TRUMP VOTERS IN\nA WAY THAT WAS INARTFUL. IT MAY HAVE BEEN ACCURATE IN\nCERTAIN -- BASED ON SOME OF THE SURVEYS THAT WE'VE SEEN ABOUT\nATTITUDES OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS AND OTHER ANECDOTAL INFORMATION\nTHAT WE HAVE. BUT YOU KNOW, HER WHOLE SLOGAN\nRHETORICALLY IS THAT WE'RE STRONGER TOGETHER.\nAND THAT WAS NOT AN EXAMPLE OF THAT WHEN SHE WAS IN THAT\nFUND-RAISER. THERE SHE'S SAYING NO I'M GOING\nTO SPEAK OUT AGAINST HATEFUL SPEECH ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE'S\nA BIRTHER, THAT DAVID DUKE IS BEHIND HIM.\nI MEAN I THINK THIS IS HER GETTING A LITTLE BIT MORE\nAGGRESSIVE. I THINK THIS IS A PREVIEW OF THE\nKIND OF HILLARY CLINTON THAT WE'LL SEE DURING ASPECTS OF\nTHESE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES. AND ANOTHER THING CHRIS AND\nALISYN, SHE ALSO WANTS TO SHOW A LITTLE BIT MORE FIGHT, AS SHE\nWANTS TO GIVE THAT CORE GROUP OF SUPPORTERS, MILLENNIAL VOTERS,\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS, AND WOMEN AND OTHERS TO GET BEHIND\nHER AND GET MORE ENTHUSIASTIC SO THAT EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THIS\nIS A TIGHT RACE. WHETHER IT SHOULD BE OR NOT.\nFROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW, IT HAS BECOME A TIGHT RACE.\n>> DAVID, WE JUST HAD SECRETARY SHALALA ON WHO IS NOW THE HEAD\nOF THE CLINTON FOUNDATION. AND SHE SAID NO PROBLEM I MEAN\nSHE BASICALLY ANNOUNCED THE CHANGES THAT WILL BE HAPPENING\nPRESIDENT CLINTON WILL BE STEPPING DOWN IF HILLARY CLINTON\nIS ELECTED BUT CHELSEA CLINTON WILL CONTINUE TO BE INVOLVED.\nANY PROBLEM OR ISSUE WITH THAT FOR VOTERS?\n>> WELL I MEAN PEOPLE MAY HAVE AN ISSUE.\nWE'LL HAVE TO SEE. I MEAN AGAIN I THINK THE\nFOUNDATION BUSINESS, AND ANY CONFLICTS OF INTEREST GOES TO\nTHE HEART OF WHAT PEOPLE DON'T TRUST ABOUT THE CLINTONS,\nPLURAL, NOT JUST HILLARY CLINTON.\nKIND OF SELF-DEALING, INSIDER BUSINESS.\nIT'S ALWAYS BEEN A QUESTION WHAT ROLE WILL BILL CLINTON PLAY IN A\nCLINTON WHITE HOUSE. IT'S UNUSUAL.\nIT'S UNPRECEDENTED. THE FOUNDATION SPEAKS TO THAT.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT THIS IF THEY HAVE A CONCERN AND\nWILL SEE SATISFACTORY ANSWERS IN TERMS OF NO MORE OF THE CLINTON\nGLOBAL INITIATIVE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS IF SHE IS THE PRESIDENT.\nTHEY PROBABLY, PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS WOULD HAVE\nLIKED TO HAVE SEEN THE CHANGES PUT INTO EFFECT EARLIER, AND\nTHAT LINE VERY CLEARLY DRAWN, BUT LOOK, I THINK THIS JUST\nBECOMES AN ISH YOU'VE OF PEOPLE WHO AREN'T GOING TO BELIEVE IT\nARE GOING TO KEEP QUESTIONS A LOT.\n>> HOW BIG A DEAL SHOULD TRUMP'S DEALINGS WITH FOREIGN ACTORS BE\nIN THIS ELECTION? THEY'RE USING IT, THE CLINTON\nPEOPLE, TO SET IT UP AS A POINT OF COMPARISON WITH THE\nFOUNDATION. HOW DO YOU THINK IT PLAYS?\n>> I THINK WE SHOULD KNOW MORE. WE SHOULD KNOW MORE ON BOTH\nSIDES ABOUT WHAT THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WERE, FINANCIAL\nAND OTHERWISE TO GAUGE POTENTIAL INFLUENCE.\nTHOSE ARE FAIR QUESTIONS FOR CLINTON, FOR THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION AS WELL, AND CERTAINLY THAT WOULD APPLY TO\nTRUMP. >> NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO\nTOMORROW THE BIG POINT OF DEFENSE FROM THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN\nIS IT'S IN THE FCC FILINGS, IT'S IN THERE.\nIT'S ALL IN THERE. IT IS NOT ALL IN THERE.\nWE WILL TELL YOU WHY IT'S NOT ALL IN THERE AND WHAT ELSE NEEDS\nTO BE NONE. WE'LL HAVE IT TOMORROW.\n>> DAVID GREGORY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nTHE GOOD STUFF IS NEXT.",

WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.\nTHEY PROBABLY DON'T KNOW EITHER. WHO KNOWS WHAT IN TERMS OF THE\nHILLARY CAMPAIGN. >> LAST NIGHT IT WAS ABOUT TONE.\n>> HE SAID STAMINA.

IN THE PRIMARY SAW A BARRAGE OF\nINSULTS FROM DONALD TRUMP, WATCH.\n>> FIRST OF ALL THIS GUY IS A CHOKE ARTIST AND THIS GUY IS A\nLIAR. >> YOU'RE TOUGH.\n>> WE NEED A LEADER. >> YOU'RE TOUGH.\nI'M AT 42 AND YOU'RE AT 3. >> DOESN'T MATTER.\n>> SO FAR DOING BETTER. >> NEVER ATTACKED HIM ON HIS\nLOOK AND BELIEVE ME, PLENTY OF SUBJECT MATTER RIGHT THERE.\nTHAT I CAN TELL YOU. >> SORRY.\nHE BEAT OUT 16 OTHER CANDIDATES USING THIS TACTIC.\nDO YOU THINK IT'S WINNING FORMULA HE SHOULD DO AGAIN ANDY?\n>> I THINK TRUMP IS ONE OF THE BEST COUNTERPUNCHERS I'VE SEEN.\nH'ES NOT THE FIRST GO ON THE ATTACK BUT WILL DESTROY HIS\nOPPONENT. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DEBATES IF\nHILLARY GOES AFTER HIM, I WISH HER LUCK.\n>> HOW DOES SHE FIGHT BACK? >> SUBSTANCE AND POLICY.\nEVERYONE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THE SHOWMAN THAT DONALD TRUMP IS AND\nHOW HE DOES WITH AUDIENCE. THE FACT IS DONALD TRUMP NEVER\nDONE THIS DAY BEFORE IN HIS LIFE.\nON STAGE ONE ON ONE HAVING A DEBATE ABOUT SUBSTANCE WITH\nPROFESSIONAL MODERATORS THERE. ENTIRE WORLD WATCHING.\nNEVER DONE IT BEFORE. HILLARY CLINTON HAS.\nWHAT PEOPLE ALSO DON'T KNOW IS THE ADDED ADVANTAGE HILLARY\nCLINTON HAS IS SHE'S A WOMAN. DONALD TRUMP HAS NEVER BEEN ON\nSTAGE WITH A WOMAN STANDING TOE-TO-TOE AND TELL HIM HE'S\nWRONG AND HAVE MORE DEPTH ON DOMESTIC POLICY THAN HE DOES.\nCAN HE'S GOING TO BE SO FAR OUT OF WATER THAT HE'S GOING TO BE\nUNCOMFORTABLE. I DON'T THINK DO WELL IN THE\nFIRST ONE. MAYBE AFTER.\n>> EXCEPT THE LADY IN THE CHURCH.\n>> THAT WAS TELLING. >> THERE'S A NEW POLL SAYING\nTHREE POINTS AHEAD IN FLORIDA. HOW DID TRUMP TURN THIS AROUND?\n>> HE STAYED ON MESSAGE. THE THEME TO THE SEGMENT WAS THE\nINSULT COMIC ROUTINE. OF HE'S DONALD TRUMP THAT BE\nSTICKING TO THE SCRIPT. HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN TALKING\nABOUT THE BASKET OF DEPLORABLES. HER NUMBERS HAVE SUFFERED\nBECAUSE OF IT. I THINK DONALD TRUMP SHOULD\nCONTINUE WHAT HE'S DOING. THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE, NOT JUST\nTHE NATIONAL NUMBERS IS GETTING BETTER FOR TRUMP BY THE DAY.\nI SAY KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING.\n>> THERE'S A NEW POLL THAT SHOWS DONALD TRUMP AHEAD OF HILLARY\nCLINTON. SHE WAS AHEAD BY FOUR POINTS IN\nJULY. SHE WAS WAY UP THERE.\nYOU WERE WORRIED THAT PEOPLE WOULDN'T REALIZE HOW CLOSE THIS\nRACE COULD GET. ARE YOU WORRIED NOW FOR A\nTOTALLY DIFFERENT REASON? >> NO.\nI CONTINUE TO BE WORRIED, AND I HOPE THAT THE HILLARY CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN, I KNOW THE HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS WORRIED.\nTHEY NEED TO WAKE UP EVERY DAY WORRIED AND RUN AS IF SHE'S TEN\nPOINTS BEHIND. I'VE SAID THIS REPEATEDLY ON\nYOUR SHOW. IT'S THE ONLY WAY THEY GET TO\nTHE POINT OF NOT JUST MAKING SURE HILLARY CLINTON IS OUT\nTHERE THE WAY SHE'S BEEN DOING, UNDERSCORING THE MESSAGE SHE'S\nTHE ONE WITH THE SUBSTANCE AND THE ONE WITH THE KNOWLEDGE AND\nTHE EXPERIENCE, THE STEELY STEADINESS, AND THE TEMPERAMENT\nTO BE COMMANDER IN CHIEF VERSUS THE JOKE THAT HAS BECOME DONALD\nTRUMP. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, TO MAKE\nSURE THAT DEMOCRATS, INDEPENDENTS, AND SANE MINDED\nREPUBLICANS WHO UNDERSTAND WHAT A DANGER THIS MAN WOULD BE\nANYWHERE CLOSE TO THE OVAL OFFICE WITH HIS HANDS ON THE\nNUCLEAR CODES DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO MAKE SURE THEY GET OUT\nAND VOTE AND THEIR FAMILIES AND FRIENDS GET OUT AND VOTE.\nFOR THE OBAMA COALITION, I THINK THIS IS GOOD, BECAUSE IT WILL\nMOBILIZE THEM. AND I ACTUALLY THINK THAT THE\nLAST COUPLE DAYS HAVE HURT HER. SHE'S BEEN OFF THE TRAIL.\nYOU KNOW, IN TERMS OF ACTUAL WORRY, THESE POLLS, I DON'T BUY\nTHE FLORIDA OR NEVADA POLL UNLESS YOU'RE POLLING WITH\nBILINGUAL POLLSTERS, YOU'RE SUPPORT AMONG LATINO VOTERS IS\nNOT SHOWING UP. THAT'S THE CASE WITH OTHER\nMINORITY POPULATIONS AS WELL. I'M GLAD IT'S GETTING CLOSER.\n>> YOU HAVE A SIMILAR THEORY ABOUT THE POLLS, DON'T YOU?\n>> YEAH. I THINK SOME OF THE THINGS\nYOU'VE BEEN SAYING AND THE CNN POLLS IS I THINK THAT POLLSTERS\nARE PROJECTING THE ELECTORATE TO BE WIDER.\nIT'S SOMETHING THAT HASN'T HAPPENED IN DECADES.\nI THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE MODEL, EVEN THE MODEL IN 2008\nHAVE YOU HAD EXTREMELY HIGH AFRICAN AMERICAN AND HISPANIC\nTURNOUT, IN 2012 IT WAS HIGHER. AFRICAN AMERICANS AND HISPANIC\nAMERICANS STARTED TO PARTICIPATE AT HIGHER RATES.\nTHE NUMBERS, YOU SHOULDN'T SEE THE POLLS RETROGRESZ.\nTHEY SHOULD INCREASE. >> GO AHEAD, ANDY.\n>> NOW THAT TRUMP IS LEADING OR WINNING IN MOST OF THE SWING\nSTATES AND NATIONALLY, THE PUNDITS NOW HAVE A PROBLEM WITH\nTHE METHODOLOGY OF THE POLLS. WE KNEW THIS WAS COMING.\n>> I'VE ALWAYS HAD THIS ISSUE. >> HE'S NOT WINNING NATIONALLY.\nTHE CNN POLL WAS AN OUTLIER. AND IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT THE E\nLELECTORAL COLLEGE, IF YOU GIVE HIM OHIO AND NORTH CAROLINA, YOU\nKNOW WHAT HAPPENS ON NOVEMBER 8TH?\nYOU'RE STILL SAYING MADAM PRESIDENT.\nI THINK -- >> BUT FLORIDA, AND REMEMBER,\nTRUMP DID WELL WITH LATINOS IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY, BEATING\nTHE HOME STATE SENATOR. >> THAT'S NOT SAYING A LOT.\nSORRY. >> HE WON BY 18 POINTS.\n>> THAT'S NOT SAYING A WHOLE LOT.\n>> I HAVE TEN SECONDS IN. >> THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT SAYS\nTHAT THE OBAMA COALITION IS GOING TO TURN OUT IN THE SAME OR\nSIMILAR NUMBERS WITH HILLARY CLINTON.\n>> THAT'S WHY THE PRESIDENT IS OUT THERE.\n>> FUNDAMENTALLY -- >> THANK YOU, GUYS.\nTHAT'S IT FOR US TONIGHT. THANKS FOR WATCHING.\nI'LL SEE YOU BACK HERE TOMORROW. GOOD NIGHT. .\n. .",

I DON'T KNOW WHY THAT IS, BUT\nAPPARENTLY THE LIBERTARIANS ARE DRAWING MORE FROM\nHILLARY CLINTON. I'M NOT SURE WHY.\n>> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THESE POLLS THAT SHOW THINGS\nREVERSING, NOT ONLY NARROWING, BUT REVERSING COMPLETELY?\nIN KEY STATES LIKE OHIO AND FLORIDA, DOWN TO SINGLE DIGITS\nIN PENNSYLVANIA. WAY TOO EARLY, AND SMART FOLKS\nLIKE YOU REMIND ME THAT THINGS CHANGE A LOT, BUT THAT WASN'T\nSUPPOSED TO BE THE CASE. SUDDENLY IT IS.\n>> YEAH, I THINK A LOT OF IT WAS THIS GRADUAL END OF HER\nCONVENTION BOUNCE, BUT STILL THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE GOING\nAWAY ABOUT TWO OR THREE WEEK AGO.\nTHERE HAS BEEN MORE QUESTION BEING HER HEALTH, OF COURSE, I\nDON'T KNOW HOW BIG OF AN IMPACT THAT IS HAVING, BUT WE'LL\nCONTINUE TO SEE TRANSPARENCY QUESTIONS ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON,\nAND IT COMES BACK TO THAT VERY CLEAR HONEST AND TRUST WORTHY\nQUESTION WITH HER. AMERICANS HAVE A TOUGH TIME\nDEFENDING HER ON THE ISSUE. SHE HAS A TOUGH TIME EXPLAINING\nIT. >> THIS HEALTH ISSUE, DO YOU\nTHINK IT BECOMES A BIG ISSUE? A THE LO LOT OF THE TRUMP FOLKS\nWERE RELIEVED WE WERE LOOKING AT THIS, AND NO ONE IS TALKING\nABOUT TAX RETURNS. AND THEN HE GOES ON DR. OZ, SAYS\nHE'S LOOKING GOOD. PEOPLE WHO WATCH THE SHOW ARE\nSAYING THAT HE WAS SAYING, YEAH, I COULD AFFORD TO LOSE SOME\nWEIGHT, BUT I'M IN GREAT SHAPE. DR. OZ SEEMED TO BE AGREEING\nWITH THAT SENTIMENT. HOW MUCH CAN YOU LEARN APPEARING\nON A SHOW LIKE THAT? OR DOES THAT MATTER THIS IT\nREACHES A KEY AUDIENCE. >> IT DOESN'T SEEM TO AT LEAST\nSHOW MORE TRANSPARENCY THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS ON THIS\nISSUE. SHE HASN'T GONE ON TV AND\nDISCUSSED IN A WIDE-OPEN INTERVIEW HER HEALTH RECORDS\nLIKE DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO DO WHEN THE TAPE COMES OUT\nTOMORROW. AT THE SAME TIME I WONDER HOW\nBIG AN EFFECT IT WOULD HAVE ON THE ELECTION.\nI THINK BARK TO 2008 WITH JACK McCAIN HE LOST IN THE END, BUT I\nDON'T THINK IT WAS BECAUSE OF HIS HEALTH, BUT AT THE SAME TIME\nHIS HEALTH PROBLEMS WEREN'T AS CLEAR AS HILLARY CLINTON'S ARE\nIN THIS ELECTION WITH THE VIDEO OF HER FAINTING OR FALLING DOWN,\nTHIS PNEUMONIA, YOU KNOW, WE'LL SEE IF IT'S STILL AN ISSUE IN\nTHE NEXT MONTH OR SO, BUT AS OF RIGHT NOW IT'S HAVING AN EFFECT.\n>> SOME OF YOU SAYING IF YOU DO THE MEDIA'S BIDDING, WHETHER\nIT'S ON TAX RETURNS AS MITT ROMNEY FOUND OUT, OR MEDICAL\nRECORDS, IT DOESN'T REALLY MOVE THE NEEDLE FORM.\n>> YEAH, I MEAN AMERICANS ARE GENERALLY -- WHEN YOU ASK WHAT\nTHEIR BIGGEST PROBLEM IN THE COUNTRY IS, IT'S NOT THE HEALTH\nOF OUR CANDIDATES, WHAT ARE THEIR TAX RETURNS SAYING?\nTHEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT JOBS, ABOUT THE ECONOMY.\nTHEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THEIR WAGES ARE RISING AND LIVES ARE\nIMPROVING. I CAN SEE AN ARGUMENT THAT\nAMERICANS DON'T CARE TOO MUCH ABOUT THE HEALTH OF THESE\nCANDIDATES. >> AND THEY SHOULD BE CAREFUL IN\nTHE CLINTON CAMP, RIGHT? MAKING FUN OF DONALD TRUMP.\nI ALWAYS FEEL THAT COMES BACK TO BITE YOU.\nBECAUSE A LOT OF AMERICANS LIKE FAST FOOD.\n>> YOU DON'T WANT TO LOOK ELITIST.\nFAST FOOD IS FAST FOOD AND IT'S A HUGE INDUSTRY FOR A REASON.\nEVEN HILLARY CLINTON STOPPED A CHIPOTLE WHEN SHE WAS\nCAMPAIGNING A YEAR AND A HALF AGO OR WHENEVER IT WAS.\nIT'S CLEAR THAT AMERICANS LOVE FAST FOOD.\n>> YEAH, JASON, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS OBSESSION WITH FAST\nFOOD. JASON RUSSELL, I PROMISED YOU WE\nARE GOING TO BE GETTING NEWS OUT OF THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IN ABOUT\nFIVE MINUTES OR SO. IN FACT, I HAVE THE NEWS HERE,\nAND YOU DO NOT WANT TO LEAVE. I MEAN, IF YOU LEAVE, YOU'RE\nGOING TO MISS SOME VERY, VERY BIG NEWS, WHICH IS EMBARGOED\nRIGHT NOW. I HAVE IT HERE.\nYOU DO NOT WANT TO LEAVE FOR. IF YOU DO, THAT'S YOUR CALL.\nI'M JUST SAYING, I MEAN, I WOULD PUT OFF MAYBE A FAST FOOD RUN\nJUST FOR A SECOND. AFTER THIS. >>> ALL RIGHT.\nA LOT OF FOLKS ARE SAYING WHAT I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU IN THE\nNEXT MINUTE OR SO ALL GOES BACK TO THIS.\nTHESE KEY POLLS, DETAILS OF WHICH WERE RELEASED SHOD IT NOT\nONLY TIGHTENING UP, BUT IN BATTLEGROUND STATES, REAR\nREVERSING ITSELF.

ALL OF THIS REPORTING INTO WHAT\nIS ACTUALLY GOING ON WITH THE FOUNDATION, WHAT KIND OF\nCHARITABLE DONATIONS HAS HE GIVEN AND TO WHOM IS INCREDIBLY\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION. >> WHAT IF HE HASN'T GIVEN ANY?\nWHY SHOULD WE CARE? >> BECAUSE HE SAID THAT HE HAS.\nAND ALSO YOU WOULD THINK THAT SOMEONE AS WEALTHY AS HE IS AND\nTALK ABOUT HOW WEALTHY HE IS AND HOW GREAT HE HAS BEEN, YOU WOULD\nTHINK HE WOULD HAVE SOME INCLINATION TO GIVE BACK TO THIS\nGREAT COUNTRY AND PEOPLE IN IT THAT HAVE DONE SO MUCH TO BUOY\nHIM. >> WHAT ABOUT DEREK\nSCHNEIDERMAN. NOW LOOKING INTO THE CHARITY TO\nSEE IF ANY FUNNY BUSINESS IS A FOOT.\nIS THIS A POLITICAL HIT JOB? >> SCHNEIDERMAN NOT ONLY\nSUPPORTS HILLARY CLINTON, HE FORMALLY ENDORSED HILLARY\nCLINTON AND HAS BEEN NAME BID HER TO HER CAMPAIGN'S LEADERSHIP\nCOUNCIL. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?\nHE IS A POLITICIAN, AN PROSECUTOR.\nWHEN SHE IS DOWN FOR AN EIGHT COUNT HE SAYS WHAT CAN I DO\nPOLITICALLY TO SALVAGE CAMPAIGN AND HE JUMPS IN WITH SOMETHING\nLIKE THIS. OUTRAGEOUS ESPECIALLY WHEN THE\nFACT THAT CLINTON FOUNDATION SCANDAL CAME AROUND WITH RESPECT\nTO ISSUES OF FOREIGN DONATIONS, SHE TODAY DISCLOSE THE HUNDREDS\nOF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF FOREIGN DONATIONS.\n>> HE WASN'T AS INTERESTED. I HAVE TO GO.\n>> CRICKETS. >> KRYSTAL, IF THIS ISN'T\nPOLITICAL, COULDN'T HE HAVE WAITED AND SHOULDN'T HE HAVE\nWAITED UNTIL NOVEMBER 9? >> NO, PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW.\nIF WE CAN GET MORE FROM AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION FROM\nTHE NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL, WHY WOULDN'T HE WANT TO KNOW\nABOUT THAT? >> I DON'T KNOW IF THAT CAN.\n>> IT'S NOT INDEPENDENT. THAT'S THE POINT.\n>> UP COMING OUR WAY. >>> DEVELOPING TONIGHT.\nNEW SECURITY QUESTIONS FOLLOWING A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE\nOBAMA ADMINISTRATION.
