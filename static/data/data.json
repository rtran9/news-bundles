THAT WAS HILLARY CLINTON.\nNUMBER TWO, DONALD TRUMP SAID HE PUT THIS TO REST.\nHILLARY CLINTON COULDN'T CLOSE IT, GET THE INFORMATION, AND HE\nDID. YOU HEARD HIM SAY THAT PRESIDENT\nOBAMA WAS BORN IN THIS COUNTRY, PERIOD, AND HE'S MOVING ON.\n>> WELCOME BACK TO \"AM JOY.\" THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS STICKING\nTO ITS GUNS THAT HILLARY CLINTON AND HER 2008 CAMPAIGN STARTED\nTHE BIRTHER CONTROVERSY, WHICH OF COURSE IS NOT TRUE.\nDAVID FROM OF THE ATLANTIC. OKAY, GUYS.\nI KNOW THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT LOW IN YOUR EARS.\nWHAT WAS BEING SAID BY KELLYANNE CONWAY THERE IS THAT NOT ONLY IS\nSHE DOUBLING DOWN ON THE IDEA THAT IT IS HILLARY CLINTON'S\nCAMPAIGN THAT STARTED THE BIRTHERISM, SHE SAID, IN FACT,\nTHEY SENT SOMEONE TO AFRICA TO CHECK IT OUT.\nTRUMP WAS NOT RUNNING FOR POTUS AGAINST BARACK OBAMA IN A VERY\nBRUISING PRIMARY IN 2008. THAT WAS CLINTON.\nTRUMP SAID HE PUT THIS TO REST, CLINTON COULDN'T CLOSE IT.\nHE SAID OBAMA WAS BORN IN THE U.S.\nYOUR THOUGHTS? THEY SENT SOMEONE TO AFRICA TO\nCHECK IT OUT. >> BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP AND HIS\nCAMPAIGN -- DONALD TRUMP IS A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR.\nHIS CAMPAIGN IS FILLED WITH PATHOLOGICAL LIARS.\nI WANT PROOF OF THAT STATEMENT THAT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN\nSENT -- >> ISN'T THAT WHO WENT TO --\n>> WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO, THEY'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO\nBASICALLY SHIFT THE ATTENTION FROM DONALD TRUMP SAYING IT WAS\nHILLARY. NO, LET'S KEEP THEM HONEST.\nFOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS, YOU'VE BEEN SAYING THE PRESIDENT OF THE\nUNITED STATES IS -- IS NOT LEGITIMATE BECAUSE HE COMES --\nBECAUSE HE, QUOTE, COMES FROM AFRICA AND MAY BE A MUSLIM.\nWE CAN'T LET HIM GET AWAY WITH THIS.\nLET'S ACTUALLY KEEP THEM HONEST. YOU STARTED THE BIRTHER\nMOVEMENT. OWN IT.\n>> YOU'VE HAD A FORMER MEMBER OF THE DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN, WHO\nI'M GOING TO ASK MY PRODUCERS TO KINDLY REMIND ME OF HIS NAME.\nHE OWNED THE FACT THAT THIS WAS A CAMPAIGN STRATEGY, \"NEW YORK\nTIMES\" PIECE THAT QUOTES HIM SAYING, WE DECIDED TO LATCH ONTO\nTHIS BIRTHER IDEA AS A STRATEGY TO LAUNCH HIM AS A NATIONAL\nFIGURE. WHY ARE THEY SUDDENLY ATTEMPTING\nTO LIE ABOUT IT WHEN THEY'VE OWNED IT IN THE PAST?\n>> DONALD TRUMP IS A VERY AMERICAN CHARACTER.\nTHE PERSON WHO PLAYS ON THE WEAKNESSES AND INSECURITIES OF\nOTHERS TO SELL THEM THINGS THEY WOULDN'T OTHERWISE BUY.\nTHAT'S SOMETHING VERY SOVIET ABOUT HIS CAMPAIGN.\nTHE CONSTANTLY CHANGING LIES AND THE NEED TO SAY, FOR KELLYANNE\nCONWAY, A FORMERLY RESPECTED FIGURE IN AMERICAN POLITICS, TO\nSAY ONE THING ONE DAY AND A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THING THE\nNEXT DAY. THE HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN DID\nGET UP TO A LOT OF MISCHIEF ON THIS FRONT.\nBUT IT WAS KNOWN, MARK PENN'S FAMOUS MEMO WAS PUBLISHED ON THE\nATLANTIC WEBSITE IN 2008. IT'S STILL THERE IF YOU WANT TO\nREAD IT. SYDNEY BLOOMENTHAL, THAT WAS\nREPORTED IN 2009 AND 2010. IT IS VERY HARD TO IMAGINE THAT\nHE COULD BE SHOPPING A STORY TO DOZENS OF REPORTERS AND IT\nREMAIN A SECRET FOR EIGHT YEARS LATER.\nIF HE SHOPPED DOZENS OF REPORTERS AS HE SHOPPED THE\nWHITEY TAPE STORY, THOSE REPORTERS WOULD KNOW ABOUT IT.\nEVEN IF THEY WERE SWORN TO SECRECY DURING THE CAMPAIGN, IT\nWOULD BE IN THEIR POST-CAMPAIGN BOOKS.\n>> ABSOLUTELY. >> SO THE IDEA THAT EIGHT YEARS\nLATER BECAUSE ONE PERSON HAD THIS RECOLLECTION YOU\nNECESSARILY BELIEVE IT. ONE MORE THING ABOUT SENDING THE\nPERSON TO AFRICA. I THINK KELLYANNE CONWAY THERE\nHAS MISTAKEN SOMETHING THAT DID ACTUALLY HAPPEN.\nIT WAS TRUE THAT THE OLD NEWSPAPER -- THEY HAD A NAIROBI\nBUREAU. YOU GET THIS STORY IN 2008.\nIT'S NOT CRAZY YOU WOULD CALL UP YOUR NAIROBI BUREAU CHIEF AND\nSAY LOOK INTO THIS. A HEAVILY PREGNANT WOMAN GOT ON\nA PROP PLANE IN HAWAII AND SPENT A YEAR'S INCOME IN ORDER TO FLY\nFROM L.A. TO NEW YORK AND FROM ROME TO NAIROBI IN ORDER TO GIVE\nHER CHILD THE ADVANTAGES -- [ LAUGHTER ]\n>> FOR THE PURPOSES OF MAKING A PERSON NAMED BARACK HUSSEIN\nOBAMA PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nNONE OF THIS MAKES ANY SENSE. >> THAT'S INCREDIBLE FORESIGHT\nRIGHT. WHAT DAVID WAS SAYING, WE HAVE\nTO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CONTINUE HOLDING THEM ACCOUNTABLE.\nIT'S INCREASINGLY LOOKING LIKE A THIRD WORLD BANANA REPUBLIC\nELECTION WHERE PEOPLE ARE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO INSTIGATE\nAND CAUSE FEAR BY LYING. >> HAVING WRITTEN A BOOK BY THE\nWAY ON THIS -- NOT PLUGGING MY OWN BOOK.\n>> CALLED FRACTURE. >> THIS IS INCIDENT PLAY INTO\nIT. EVERYBODY WHO'S WRITTEN A BOOK\nABOUT HILLARY CLINTON IN ANY SHAPE OR FORM COULD HAVE FOUND\nTHE INFORMATION OUT HAD HER CAMPAIGN BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR\nBIRTHERISM. IT WOULD BE IN MY BOOK, EVERY\nSINGLE BOOK ABOUT THAT CAMPAIGN. LET'S MOVE ONTO THE NEXT THING.\n. YOU TALKED ABOUT THE SOVIET\nNATURE OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. THIS PRESS CONFERENCE THAT TOOK\nPLACE NOT FAR FROM HERE AT DONALD TRUMP'S NEW WASHINGTON,\nD.C. HOTEL. IT WAS NOT A PRESS CONFERENCE.\nIT WAS A COMMERCIAL FOR HIS COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE THAT\nTURNED INTO A 37-SECOND STATEMENT AND A 7-SECOND\nRETRACTION OF BIRTHERISMBIRTHER. THIS IS KELLYANNE CONWAY ON\n\"MEET THE PRESS\". >> I CAN'T BELIEVE SOME OF YOU\nIN THE MEDIA WERE SUPPOSE SET THAT THEY HAD TO GIVE 25 MINUTES\nOF COVERAGE TO THESE INCREDIBLE VETERANS AND MILITARY HEROS WHO\nTOOK THE STAGE. DON'T THEY DESERVE 25 MINUTES OF\nCOVERAGE? PEOPLE GET THEMSELVES UP IN THIS\nTIZZY AND PROJECT ONTO OUR CAMPAIGN.\n>> JONATHAN, I'M GOING TO ASK YOU THIS BECAUSE YOU WORK FOR\nTHE \"WASHINGTON POST.\" IF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAD SAID\nWE'D LIKE YOU TO COME TO A PRESS CONFERENCE ABOUT MILITARY\nVETERANS, WOULD THE POST HAVE SAID ABSOLUTELY NOT?\nIS THE ONLY WAY TO HAVE GOTTEN THEM THERE TO TRICK THEM INTO\nSAYING HE WAS GOING TO RESPOND ON BIRTHERISM?\n>> NO. DONALD TRUMP IS A REPUBLICAN\nNOMINEE. IF HE'S DOING AN EVENT, THE\n\"WASHINGTON POST\" WOULD GO, ASSUMING HE'D LET US IN.\nREMEMBER, ALL THAT MORNING, THE CAMPAIGN WAS TELEGRAPHING MAJOR\nANNOUNCEMENT FROM DONALD TRUMP. EVERYONE THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO\nBE ON BIRTHERISM. AT NO POINT DID I KNOW OR ANYONE\nKNOW THAT THERE WERE GOING TO BE 20 VETERANS ON THAT STAGE WITH\nHIM.",

THAT'S WITHIN THE MARGIN OF\nERROR AND SHOWS NEITHER CANDIDATE IS CLOSE TO HAVING A\nMAJORITY OF VOTERSES. I WANT TO BRING IN CHRISTY, AN\nANCHOR FOR PBS NEWS IN DETROIT AND NOLAN AN EDITOR AT THE\nDETROIT NEWS. TRUMP'S METHOD ON TRADE AND\nCOMMENTS ON FORD ARE TAILOR MADE FOR MICHIGAN VOTERS.\nIS IT REALLY RESINATING? NOLAN, YOU FIRST.\n>> NO, I DON'T THINK IT WILL RESINATE.\nTHE PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE HAVE SEEN THIS INDUSTRY COME ROARING\nBACK OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. THEY ARE DOING VERY WELL\nFINANCIALLY. FORD EMPLOYEE RS, GM EMPLOYEES,\nCHRYSLER EMPLOYEES, SUPPLIERS, THEY ARE MAKING MONEY AGAIN,\nTHEY ARE GETTING BONUSES. IN THE LAST CONTRACT, THEIR BASE\nPAY WENT UP. THE AUTO INDUSTRY IS BOOMING\nHERE. WE KNOW WHAT A DOWN AUTO\nINDUSTRY LOOKS LIKE. WE HAVE LIVED THROUGH IT.\nTHIS IS BOOM TIME IN TERMS OF AUTO MOTIVE FOR DETROIT AND\nMICHIGAN. I DON'T GET THE MESSAGE AND\nTHINK IT RESINATES HERE. PEOPLE KNOW BETTER.\n>> HILLARY CLINTON STRENGTH IN THAT STATE PRIMARILY HAS BEEN\nWITH AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS OR THE NUMBERS SHOW THAT.\nIS THERE ENOUGH SUPPORT TO CARRY THE STATE FOR HER WHEN LOOKING\nAT THAT KIND OF DEMOGRAPHIC? >> WELL, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT\nDEMOGRAPHIC, SHE'S ENJOYED A LOT OF SUPPORT.\nWHAT'S INTERESTING AND HAS A LOT OF PEOPLE TALKING ARE THE POLLS\nYOU REFERENCED THAT CAME OUT THIS WEEK.\nIF YOU ASKED PEOPLE A MONTH AND A HALF AGO IF THE NUMBERS WOULD\nBE THIS TIGHT BETWEEN CLINTON AND TRUMP, PEOPLE IN MICHIGAN\nWOULD HAVE ROLLED THEIR EYES AND LAUGHED AND SAID NO WAY.\nLOOK AT THE NUMBERS NOW AND THE SUPPORT THAT HILLARY CLINTON\nTHAT'S ERODED FROM HER, TALK ABOUT AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN THE\nLATEST WXYZ POLL, SHE ENJOYED 85% AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE TO 2%\nFOR TRUMP. THAT ERODED DOWN TO 74% ON THE\n2%. NOW, SHE'S NOT IN DANGER OF\nHAVING AFRICAN-AMERICANS GO TOTALLY TO DONALD TRUMP'S SIDE,\nBUT IT'S INTERESTING TO LOOK AT THE EROSION AND WHAT KIND OF\nMESSAGE THAT IS SENDING AND WHAT VOTERS ARE THINKING ABOUT.\nI WOULD BE INTERESTED TO SEE NOW THIS NEXT POLL IN MICHIGAN\nCOMING OFF THE HEELS OF THE BIRTHER CONTROVERSY THAT DONALD\nTRUMP CAME OUT AND TALKED ABOUT IN THE LAST DAY OR SO.\nTHE AFRICAN-AMERICANS SEE THE RACIAL OVERTONES OF THAT.\nYOU HAVE TO WATCH THE NUMBERS OF THOSE POLLS IN MICHIGAN COMING\nUP NEXT. >> NOLAN IS THERE A FEELING\nBEHIND WHAT IS BEHIND THAT EROSION AND WHETHER THE POLLING\nIS A GOOD MIRROR OF HOW VOTERS ARE THINKING AND FEELING THERE?\n>> LOOK AT THE NUMBERS. IT'S ALL ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON.\nDONALD TRUMP'S NUMBERS HAVE STAYED STEADY.\nHE'S IN THE LOW 40 RANGE IN POLL AFTER POLL IN MICHIGAN AND\nNATIONWIDE. HE NEVER BREAKS ABOVE HERE, MUCH\nABOVE 41-42. CHRISTY MENTIONED THE\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE ERODING FOR CLINTON, BUT TRUMP DIDN'T\nPICK UP ANY OF THAT VOTE. I THINK THAT'S THE STORY.\nI THINK IT'S A MISTAKE SHE'S POUNDING, POUNDING, POUNDING ON\nDONALD TRUMP. HIS NUMBER IS WHERE IT'S AT.\nIT'S NOT GOING UP, IT'S NOT GOING DOWN.\nSHE NEEDS TO WORRY ABOUT BRINGING HER OWN NUMBER UP.\nSHE'S NOT DOING A GOOD JOB AT THAT.\nSHE'S ALMOST OBSESSED WITH DONALD TRUMP AND POUNDING ON\nDONALD TRUMP. SHE NEEDS TO TELL US ABOUT WHO\nHILLARY CLINTON IS, WHY WE SHOULD TRUST HER AND BELIEVE IN\nHER VISION OF THE PRESIDENCY. >> YOU KNOW, CHRISTY, IS THERE A\nFEELING THAT, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ARE INTERPRETING HILLARY CLINTON\nAS REALLY KIND OF GETTING SUCKED INTO THE APPROACH OR STRATEGY OF\nA DONALD TRUMP, WHICH IS, YOU KNOW, SAY THINGS THAT CERTAINLY\nCATCH PEOPLE'S ATTENTION, THEN SHE FALLS INTO A TRAP OF BEING\nCRITICAL OF HIM AS OPPOSED TO, AS NOLAN SAID, FOCUSING ON WHAT\nARE THE PLANS, WHAT ARE THE ISSUES, HOW DO YOU DIFFERENTIATE\nYOURSELF. >> LET'S LOOK AT IT IN TERMS OF\nPLAYING ON THE BACKDROP OF MICHIGAN WHERE BOTH CANDIDATES\nCOME INTO MICHIGAN. YOU CAN'T BLAME THEM FOR GIVING\nECONOMIC SPEECHES. THEY LAID OUT THEIR PLAN.\nI AGREE WITH NOLAN IN THE POINT SHE HAS TO DIFFERENTIATE\nHERSELF. SO MANY HILLARY CLINTON\nSUPPORTERS SAY SHE HAS. TAKE A LOOK AT THE POLICY.\nTAKE A LOOK AT THE DETAIL SHE'S PUT OUT ON HER WEBSITE AND THAT\nSHE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT EVERY TIME SHE'S ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL\nIN TERMS OF THE POLICY AND THE DETAIL THAT SHE HAS.\nBUT, SOME OF THE AD VERTISEMENT IN MICHIGAN, A LOT OF IT IS\nREPLAYING THE GAFFES, THE BIZARRE STATEMENTS TRUMP MADE ON\nTHE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND SEEING THE REACTION OF PEOPLE TO THOSE\nSTATEMENTS. THAT'S THE HILLARY CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN AD THAT'S RUNNING. I THINK SHE HAS TO REFINE THE\nMESSAGE A LITTLE MORE. IN TERMS OF MICHIGAN AND WHERE\nSHE'S LOST GROUND, TIM KAINE WAS JUST IN MICHIGAN THIS PAST WEEK.\nHE WAS SPEAKING AT U OF M. DONALD TRUMP WAS IN FLINT THIS\nWEEK. AGAIN, WE TALK ABOUT THE NUMBERS\nAND THE FACT THAT THE STATE IS VERY MUCH IN PLAY.\nTIM KAINE SAID, LOOK, THIS STATE IS DEFINITELY IN PLAY AND TRYING\nTO GET THE YOUNG VOTERS. SHE HAS TO GO BACK TO THEM.\nONE OF THE BIGGEST STORIES WAS IN THE PRIMARY, THE FACT THAT\nHILLARY CLINTON LOST MICHIGAN TO BERNIE SANDERS.\nSHE DOES HAVE GROUND TO MAKE UP HERE.\nSHE DOES HAVE TO, I THINK GET BACK TO THE STATE.\n>> ALL RIGHT. CHRISTY McDONALD.\nNOLAN, REAL QUICK NOLAN. TEN SECONDS.\n>> YEAH, I THINK THE FACT THAT MICHIGAN IS IN PLAY AND THE\nCANDIDATES CLEARLY VIEW IT THAT WAY IS SURPRISING.\nAS YOU SAID, THEY HAVEN'T GONE REPUBLICAN HERE SINCE 1988.\nIT'S HARD TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY ARE SEEING THAT THEY THINK\nTHIS YEAR MIGHT BE DIFFERENT. >> EVERYTHING IS FASCINATING.\nAPPRECIATE IT.",

HE WENT ON TO SAY AFTER THAT\nCOMMENT THAT HE WAS BEING SARCASTIC ABOUT THAT.\nHE OBVIOUSLY FEELS LIKE HE WAS BEING SARCASTIC ABOUT WHAT HE\nSAID LAST NIGHT IN MIAMI.

IT IS STANDARD OPERATING\nPROCEDURE FOR BOTH OF THEM TO HAVE THAT BLANKET OF SECURITY\nAROUND HIM AT ALL TIMES. IT IS SURPRISING TO HEAR HIM SAY\nSOMETHING LIKE THAT. GETTING BACK TO THE MESSAGE OF\nTHIS EVENT WE SAW TODAY, HE WAS GETTING BACK ON SCRIPT AND\nMESSAGE AFTER DAYS OF CONTROVERSIES ABOUT THE BIRTH\nSER AND LAST NIGHT IN MIAMI WITH GUN CONTROL AND HILLARY CLINTON.\nHE TALKED ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IN FRONT OF THIS\nGROUP MADE UP OF FAMILIES OF VICTIMS OF UNDOCUMENTED\nCRIMINALS. TRUMP ACCUSED HILLARY CLINTON OF\nBEING IN FAVOR OF OPEN BORDERS AN NOT BEING IN FAVOR OF\nENFORCING THE BORDER AT THE U.S./MEXICO BORDER.\nHE WENT ON TO SAY IF ELECTED PRESIDENT, HE WILL DO THAT\nBETTER THAN ANY PRESIDENT WE HAVE SEEN BEFORE.\nHERE IS MORE OF WHAT HE HAD TO SAY.\n>> EVERY DAY, OUR BORDER REMAINS OPEN, INNOCENT AMERICANS ARE\nNEEDLESSLY VICTIMIZED AND KILLED.\nEVERY DAY, SANCTUARY CITIES ARE LEFT IN PLACE, INNOCENT\nAMERICANS ARE PUT IN HARM'S WAY. EVERY DAY, WE FAIL TO ENFORCE\nOUR LAWS THIS IS ABSOLUTELY HAPPENING ALL THE TIME.\nA DAY WHEN A LOVING PARENT IS AT RISK OF LOSING THEIR CHILD.\nIT IS HAPPENING EVERY SINGLE DAY.\nDINING ROOM TABLES HAVE AN EMPTY SEAT AT THE FAMILY TABLE.\n>> Reporter: UNLIKE A LOT OF EVENTS WHERE DONALD TRUMP MAY\nVEER OFF, HE DIDN'T DO THAT. HE DID NOT TALK ABOUT HILLARY\nCLINTON AND GUN CONTROL. HE DOES HAVE A RALLY LATER ON\nTONIGHT IN COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO.\nJUST A LITTLE SIDE NOTE. WE SHOULD POINT OUT TRUMP IS\nHEAD TOG A FUND-RAISER IN OKLAHOMA.\nHE IS NOT TAKING HIS TRAVELING PRESS CORE WITH HIM.\nTHEY ARE GOING ON TO COLORADO TO WAIT FOR HIM TO DELIVER A SPEECH\nAT THE RALLY THERE.

WHAT ARE YOU DO YOU BELIEVE\nDONALD TRUMP'S FOREIGN POLICY CREDENTIALS THAT MAKE HIM\nSUPERIOR IN DEALING WITH FOREIGN POLIC\nPOLICY ISSUES LIKE WHAT WE SEE HAPPENING TODAY.\n>> HIS INVOLVEMENT IN FOREIGN ISSUES IS NOT THERE.\nBUT HAS EXPERIENCE NEGOTIATING AGREEMENTS.\nGIVES HIM AS MUCH OF A HANDLE AS LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE HAD MOVING\nINTO PRESIDENCY WITH RESPECT TO DEALING WITH FOREIGN POLICY.\nYOU KNOW, WE'LL SEE IF HE IS PICKED TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT,\nSEE HOW THAT ALL FITS TOGETHER. BUT I THINK THERE'S A REASONABLE\nCHANCE HE'D DO A GOOD JOB. >> IS A REASONABLE CHANCE HE\nWOULD DO A GOOD JOB ENOUGH FOR YOU?\nBECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THAT NEGOTIATING BUSINESS DEALS\nSUCCESSFULLY IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN DIPLOMACY MR. WOOLSEY.\nDOES HE HAVE HAS MUCH A HANDLE ON IT AS THE FORMER SECRETARY OF\nSTATE HILLARY CLINTON, EVEN IF YOU DON'T AGREE WITH HER\nPOLICIES AND ACTIONS, DOES HE HAVE ENOUGH OF A HANDLE ON\nFOREIGN POLICY AND THE DELICACY THAT A LOT OF THIS DIPLOMACY\nTAKES? >> DEPENDS ON WHAT SHE USES THE\nHANDLE FOR. ONE OF THE E-MAILS BY COLIN\nPOWELL IN THE PAPER TWO OR THREE DAYS AGO AND HASN'T BEEN STATED\nMUCH BY MUCH OF THE MEDIA WAS POWELL'S STATEMENT THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON SCREWED UP EVERYTHING SHE TOUCHED.\nINCLUDING AND -- ESPECIALLY MOVING INTO HUBRIS, WHICH IS\nSELF-ARROGANCE IN GREEK TRAGEDIES THAT LEADS TO YOUR\nDOWNFALL. THAT'S NOT A REAL GOOD\nRECOMMENDATION. SO COLIN, I THINK, WAS CRITICAL\nOF LOTS OF FOLKS BUT ESPECIALLY THE TWO PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES\nBUT DIDN'T LEAVE WITHOUT WRITING A WORD ABOUT HER.\n>> HE WAS VERY CRITICAL OF DONALD TRUMP AS WELL AS YOU\nSTATED. ROBERT GATES, FORMER DEFENSE\nSECRETARY UNDER BUSH AND OBAMA CRITICAL.\nTOOK TRUMP TO TASK. HE SAID TRUMP IS BEYOND REPAIR,\nSTUBBORNLY UNINFORMED AND UNQUALIFIED AND UNFIT TO BE THE\nCOMMANDER IN CHIEF. WHY IS HE WRONG IN YOUR\nASSESSMENT? >> WELL I DON'T -- I THINK BOB\nIS A TOUGH GRADER. ABLE INDIVIDUAL WHO SERVED A\nNUMBER OF PRESIDENTS QUITE WELL. I THINK THAT HIS JUDGMENT ON\nTHIS WITH RESPECT TO THE POTENTIAL FOR DONALD TRUMP\nSERVING WELL AS PRESIDENT IS WRONG.\nI THINK -- >> WHY SPECIFICALLY?\n>> I THINK HE CAN DO THE JOB, AND I WILL JUST HAVE TO SEE HOW\nWELL IT GOES. I'M NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF\nASSESSING CANDIDATES OVERALL, PARTICULARLY WITH DOMESTIC\nMATTERS. >> BUT YOU ARE -- AREN'T YOU\nASSESSING. >> I JUST MAKE REMSS AND IDEAS\nWITH RESPECT TO FOREIGN POLICY AND DEFENSE.\n>> BEING THE FORMER CIA DIRECTOR WHO IS BACKING DONALD TRUMP ON\nFOREIGN POLICY COMING ONTO THE TEAM TO ADVISE HIM.\n>> I'M ADVISING HIM. >> BUT HE HAS YOUR SUPPORT OVER\nHILLARY CLINTON, ISN'T THAT THE CASE.\n>> HILLARY HASN'T CALLED AND I DON'T THINK SHE WILL.\n>> IF SHE CALLS WILL YOU BE SEPTIVE.\nTHIS IS NO THE ENDORSEMENT OF TRUMP.\n>> IT'S FANCIFUL THAT I WOULD GET A CALL FROM THE OTHER PARTY.\n>> BUT YOU'RE ADVISING DONALD TRUMP, ARE YOU SAYING YOU'RE NOT\nENDORSING HIM? >> FUNCTIONALLY OF COURSE IT'S\nENDORSEMENT. I DON'T PUT STAMPS ON THINGS AND\nENDORSE CANDIDATES. IT'S NOT WHAT I DO.\nI HELP PEOPLE WITH ADVICE. AND I'M IN THE AMERICAN\nPOLITICAL SYSTEM AS A SELECTOR OF PRESIDENTS.\n>> ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU AND MANY OTHER EXPERTS HAVE\nCALLED ONE OF THE BIGGEST THREATS TO OUR GLOBE IS GLOBAL\nWARMING, CLIMATE THREAT. THIS SURVEY OF 750 EXPERTS FROM\nTHE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM FOUND THAT A CATASTROPHE CAUSED BY\nCLIMATE CHANGE COULD BE BIGGEST POTENTIAL THREAT TO THE ECONOMY.\nYOU WROTE FORWARD TO A BOOK ABOUT THIS.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS CALLED GLOBAL WARMING A HOAX A LOT OF IT.\nTHAT'S HIS QUOTE. HOW DO YOU RECONCILE YOUR\nPOSITION WITH HIS. >> I THINK YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT\nDETAILS OF SOME OF THE STUDIES. SOME OF THEM NOT RESPONSIBLY\nDONE. BUT AS A GENERAL PROPOSITION, I\nTHINK WE DO HAVE TO GET DOWN OUR LEAKAGE OF CARBON DIOXIDE INTO\nTHE ATMOSPHERE, VARIOUS THINGS TAKING PLACE, PARTICULARLY THAT\nTO INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CLIMATE CHANGE.\nBUT IT'S NOT A SIMPLE PROPOSITION.\nMOST PEOPLE WORRIED ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE ARE TOTALLY\nWORRIED AND MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT ARE TOTALLY NOT.\nAND TO GET THE DISCUSSION GOING BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES AND SAY\nLOOK, HERE'S WHAT'S SENSIBLE, THE WAY REAGAN AND GEORGE\nSCHULTZ PUT TOGETHER A SENSIBLE POLICY TO DEAL WITH THE SOUTH\nPOLE -- >> BUT TRUMP CALLED IT A HOAX.\n>> PEOPLE USE STRONG LANGUAGE WHEN EMOTIONAL ABOUT SOMETHING.\nSEE IF IT ENDS UP THAT WAY. THAT'S HIS VIEW.\nMINE IS DIFFERENT. BUT SOME PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE\nCLIMATE CHANGE DISCUSSION DO OPERATE ON THE IDEA OF HOAX.\nSOMETHING IS THERE AND NEEDS TO --\n>> IT'S NOT WHAT THE SCIENCE TELLS US.\n>> THERE'S SEVERAL APPROACHES COMING OUT IN SCIENCE.\n>> MAJORITY OF SCIENTIFIC STUDIES.\nTHANK YOU VERY MUCH DIRECTOR WOOLSEY.\nAPPRECIATE YOUR TIME TODAY.",

              "text": "BY MR. TRUMP?\nNASTY IS ANOTHER WORD USED. SO TOO,C CONNIVING.\nIT WAS RELYING ON SMEARS. TRUMP SAID HILLARY CLINTON\nENGAGED IN THE BEHAVIOR HE'S EMPLOYING AND THEY'RE SMEAR AND\nNASTY NOT TO MENTION VICIOUS AND CONNIVING BUT ALSO WEAK FOR NOT\nGETTING AN ANSWER. AN ANSWER TO WHAT EXACTLY, MR.\nTRUMP? A NASTY SMEAR?\nWHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEMANDING ANSWERS ABOUT A NASTY SMEAR?\nIF IT'S BOGUS, NOBODY. PUT UP THE NEXT PARAGRAPH.\nHERE'S HOW IT BEGINS. IN 2011, MR. TRUMP WAS FINALLY\nABLE TO BRING THIS INCIDENT TO ITS CONCLUSION.\nWHAT UGLY INCIDENT? THE UGLY INCIDENT OF TRUMP\nASSERTING A NASTY SMEAR AGAINST THE NATION'S FIRST\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT SO AS TO DELEGITIMIZE HIM.\nLET'S KEEP READING. MR. TRUMP DID A GREAT SERVICE TO\nTHE PRESIDENT AND THE COUNTRY BY BRINGING CLOSURE TO THE ISSUE\nTHAT HILLARY CLINTON AND HER TEAM FIRST RAISED.\nTHIS IS NOW KAFKAESQUE. HE IS CLAIMING WHERE HE SPREAD A\nNASTY SMEAR ABOUT THE PRESIDENT, SOMETHING HE NOW CHARACTERIZES\nAS VICIOUS AND CONNIVING AND FOR FIVE YEARS, REFUSES TO RETRACT\nIT, SOMEHOW DONE THE PRESIDENT AND NATION A SERVICE BECAUSE\nHE'S A CLOSER, IN HIS WORDS. IT WAS ONLY THE CLOSER OF A\nNASTY SMEAR HE HIMSELF INITIATED WHICH HE ADMITS WAS VICIOUS AND\nCONNIVING. THERE WAS MORE BUT YOU GET IT.\nWHY DOES THIS NEED TO BE ADDRESSED, BECAUSE THE POLL IS\nNECK AND NECK. NOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN\nTHE DEBATES. TRUMP HAS BEEN USING THIS\nOUTRIGHT FABRICATION FOR A YEAR. WHAT SHOULD A MODERATOR DO IF HE\nOR HILLARY CLINTON MAKES ASSERTIONS THAT ARE OBVIOUSLY\nBASELESS? JOINING ME NOW IS A MAN WITH ALL\nTHE ANSWERS, MIKE McCURRY. BILL CLINTON'S WHITE HOUSE PRESS\nSECRETARY. HE HASN'T BEEN ON CNN IN 12\nYEARS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING\nHERE. WHAT IS THE JOB DESCRIPTION OF A\nMODERATOR? >> I THINK TO GET OUT OF THE WAY\nOF THE CANDIDATES. THE CANDIDATES ARE THE ONES THAT\nHAVE TO FACT CHECK EACH OTHER AND MODERATORS HAVE STRONG\nOPINIONS LIKE YOU JUST SAID. THAT'S PROBABLY NOT THE ROLE WE\nEXPECT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO PUT THE BALL IN PLAY\nAND LET THE CANDIDATES THEN HAVE THEIR DISCUSSION AS THEY SEE\nFIT. I THINK THERE'S QUESTIONS ABOUT\nASKING SOMEONE IN A DEBATE LIKE THIS AND THERE ARE RIGHT WAYS TO\nDO THAT. I THINK WE PICK MODERATORS THAT\nARE VERY EFFECTIVE AT THAT. I DON'T DOUBT DONALD TRUMP IS\nTRYING TO WORK THE REF BUT THAT HAPPENS EVERY FOUR YEARS.\nI THINK THESE MODERATORS WILL PRESENT THE CANDIDATES WITH\nOPPORTUNITIES TO CHALLENGE EACH OTHER TO FACT CHECK EACH OTHER\nAND THAT'S EXACTLY THE ROLE THEY SHOULD PLAY.\n>> SO IN MY EXAMPLE THAT I'VE JUST OFFERED, MY\nCROSS-EXAMINATION, IT WOULD BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF HILLARY\nCLINTON, NOT LESTER HOLT. >> IF YOU MODERATED LIKE THIS\nPROGRAM, I THINK PEOPLE WOULD HOWL AND PROBABLY SO BECAUSE\nYOU'RE PUTTING YOURSELF IN THE ROLE OF TRYING TO, YOU KNOW, DO\nWHAT THE CANDIDATES THEMSELVES NEED TO DO AND THAT'S NOT WHAT\nWE EXPECT OF THESE MODERATORS. WE EXPECT THEM TO BASICALLY GET\nOUT OF THE WAY OF THE CANDIDATES SO IT'S THE CANDIDATES DEBATES.\nBOB SCHIEFFER, THE LONG TIME CBS VETERAN CORRESPONDENT AND\nMODERATED MANY DEBATES SAID THE FIRST THING YOU SHOULD DO AS A\nMODERATOR BEFORE THE DEBATE IS GO LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND SAY,\nIT'S NOT ABOUT ME. >> I NOTICED THAT BOB SCHIEFFER\nAND JIM LEHRER, THEY BOTH SAY THE ROLE IS NOT TO INTRUDE AND\nTO GET OUT OF THE WAY. I THINK I HEARD MIKE McCURRY YOU\nSAY IN YOUR OPENING ANSWER THAT YOU THINK DONALD TRUMP IS TRYING\nTO WORK THE REFS A LITTLE BIT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?\n>> I THINK SOMETIMES YOU SORT OF SAY IF I SAY THAT I EXPECT TO\nGET HOWLED AT BY OUR FIRST MODERATOR WHO HAPPENS TO BE\nLESTER HOLT FROM NBC, MAYBE THAT WILL TONE HIM DOWN A LITTLE BIT.\nAND WHO KNOWS, I DON'T WANT TO TRY TO GET INTO DONALD TRUMP'S\nHEAD. THAT WOULD NOT BE A USEFUL\nEXERCISE, BUT THE CANDIDATES DO THIS.\nWE SEE THIS EVERY FOUR YEARS AND THERE ARE COMMENTS BACK AND\nFORTH ABOUT THE MODERATORS BUT THE IMPORTANT THING I THINK IS\nBOTH SECRETARY CLINTON AND MR. TRUMP WHO WERE INVITED, BY THE\nWAY, TO THE COMMISSION ON PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES TO\nPARTICIPATE ON SEPTEMBER 26 HAVE BOTH INDICATED THEY PLAN TO BE\nTHERE AND BOTH HAVE ACCEPTED THE MODERATORS HAVE WE THAT WE HAVE.\nI THINK WE PICKED EXCELLENT MODERATORS TO HELP GUIDE THAT\nDISCUSSION. >> AM I RIGHT IN SAYING YOUR JOB\nIS TO MAKE A STUDIED DETERMINATION AS TO WHO SHOULD\nMODERATE AND THEN YOU STEP OUT OF THE WAY AND THAT MAN OR THAT\nWOMAN HAS TOTAL DISCRETION TO WHAT WILL BE ASKED?\n>> THAT'S RIGHT. THEY HAVE TO USE THEIR EDITORIAL\nAND JOURNALISTIC JUDGMENT AND ASK THE QUESTION MOST AMERICANS\nWOULD EXPECT THE CANDIDATES TO BE ASKED AND THE CANDIDATES HAVE\nTO RESPOND TO EACH OTHER AND CHALLENGE EACH OTHER AND ENGAGE\nIN THE DEBATE. THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO SEE.\nWE WANT TO SEE A GOOD DISCUSSION IN A DIGNIFIED SETTING.\nWE DON'T HAVE AUDIENCE REACTION IN THESE DEBATES.\nTHEY ARE THERE TO WATCH A MOMENT OF HISTORY BUT IT'S REALLY ABOUT\nTHE CANDIDATES THEMSELVES CHALLENGING EACH OTHER, TALKING\nTO EACH OTHER ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY AND THEN PROBABLY\nMAKING SOME ARGUMENTS THAT, YOU KNOW, WILL IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER\nIMPACT THE WAY IN WHICH ONE OF THEM WILL GOVERN IF ELECTED\nPRESIDENT. >> DONALD TRUMP IS TALKING A\nLITTLE LINCOLN DOUGLAS ACTION. HE PROPOSES NO MODERATOR.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT IDEA? >> I HAVE SOME FONDNESS FOR THAT\nIDEA. I THINK IT'S GREAT WHEN WE HAVE\nGOT CANDIDATES WHO WILL STAND WITH EACH OTHER AND ACTUALLY DO\nTHAT KIND OF DEBATE. THE MODERATOR CAN PUT THINGS IN\nPLAY. BY THE WAY, ON OUR FORMAT, ONE\nOF THE THINGS WE'VE DONE IS TO GET AWAY FROM THESE HIGHLY\nSTRUCTURED ONE MINUTE HERE, 30 SECONDS THERE BACK AND FORTH.\nWE HAVE DIVIDED THE DEBATE 90 MINUTES INTO 15 MINUTE CHUNKS OF\nTIME SO THAT THE CANDIDATES WILL HAVE TO HAVE LENGTHIER\nPRESENTATIONS AND LONGER DISCUSSIONS AND MORE REASONABLE\nAND SUBSTANTIVE ANSWERS ABOUT THE DAY.\nWE'LL APPROXIMATE THAT LINCOLN DOUGLAS FORMAT BUT MAKE SURE THE\nMODERATOR MAKES THINGS STAY IN CONTROL.\n>> WERE EITHER OF THE CANDIDATES ABLE TO EXERCISE A VETO OVER\nYOUR SELECTIONS? >> NO.\nWE SUSPENDED THAT KIND OF PRACTICE A LONG TIME AGO.\nWE HAVE TO USE OUR BEST JUDGMENT IN PICKING MODERATORS.\nWE HAVE NOT HEARD FROM THE CAMPAIGNS THAT THEY HAVE\nOBJECTIONS TO THE MODERATORS WE PICKED.\nWE PICKED SOME DISTINGUISHED JOURNALISTS, AS YOU KNOW,\nINCLUDING YOUR OWN COLLEAGUE, ANDERSON COOPER FROM CNN, AND,\nYOU KNOW, I THINK THE FACT THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY KIND OF\nREAL PROTEST ABOUT THE MODERATORS INDICATES THAT PEOPLE\nEXPECT THEM TO DO THE JOB THEY'VE BEEN ASSIGNED TO DO AND\nTHERE'S BEEN A LARGE FAVORABLE REACTION TO THOSE WE DID PICK.\n>> GARY JOHNSON AND BILL WELD TOOK OUT A FULL AD DREW\nATTENTION THEY WERE AT 13% IN THE QUINNIPIAC SURVEY WHICH THEY\nARGUED PUT THEM WITHIN THE MARGIN OF ERROR TO THE REQUISITE\n15%. WHAT OF THE IDEA WHERE YOU HAVE\nTWO TWO-TERM GOVERNORS UNITED ON ALL 50 BALLOTS, DOING WELL,\nPERHAPS BETTER THAN WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST 25 YEARS.\nWHY SHOULDN'T THEY BE ON THE DEBATE STAGE?\n>> WE HAVE, BY LAW AND LEGAL PRECEDENT, ESTABLISH CRITERIA\nWELL IN ADVANCE, LET THAT BE KNOWN PUBLICLY AND IT HAS TO BE\nOBJECTED. WE DID THAT LAST FALL.\nALMOST FOR A YEAR NOW, THE CAMPAIGNS HAVE KNOWN THEY HAVE\nTO REACH THE 15% THRESHOLD. SOME MEMBERS THOUGHT IT WAS TOO\nLOW AND SOME THOUGHT IT WAS TOO HIGH.\nWE HAD A BELONG DEBATE AND BACKO THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS\nSPONSORED THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE.\nAND THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD HISTORIC PRECEDENT FOR THAT\nNUMBER AND NOT WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT BOTH GOVERNOR\nJOHNSON AND WELD OR JILL STEIN FROM THE GREEN PARTY IF THEY\nWORK HARD AND BUILD SUPPORT DURING THE COURSE OF THE FALL,\nTHEY MIGHT WELL BE INVITED IN THE SECOND AND THIRD DEBATES.\nWE'LL APPLY THE CRITERIA THAT WE USE BEFORE EACH OF THE\nPRESIDENTIAL DEBATES. AND SO THERE'S SOME POSSIBILITY\nWE MIGHT SEE GARY JOHNSON ON THAT STAGE IN ONE OF THE\nSUBSEQUENT DEBATE BUT HE DID NOT MAKE THAT THRESHOLD FOR THE\nDEBATE THAT WILL HAPPEN SEPTEMBER 26th.\n>> FINAL QUESTION, YOU STOOD BEFORE THE NATION DEFENDING\nPRESIDENT CLINTON'S WHITE HOUSE ON MATTERS LIKE WHITEWATER, THE\nOUTSET OF THE LEWINSKY SCANDAL AND TEACHING IN THE WESLEY\nTHEOLOGICAL SEMINARY. WHAT'S MORE?\n>> BEING IN FRONT OF A GROUP OF SEMI\nSEMINARNS AND GUIDING THEM. I GUESS GIVEN MY PAST, THIS\nWOULD BE THE DOCTRINE OF ATONEMENT BUT I ENJOY MY\nTEACHING NOW. >> I CANNOT WAIT, THE NATION\nCANNOT WAIT. I SALUTE THE WORK OF THE\nCOMMISSION ON PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES.\n>> THANKS, MICHAEL. >> THAT'S MIKE McCURRY.\nTWEET ME AT @SMERCONISH.",

AND SAID, WHY DON'T YOU JUST\nAPOLOGIZE AND HE DID. BUT NOT MUCH DOES HE LISTEN TO\nME. AND JUST STATING WHAT IS\nUNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR. >> YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR SISTER.\nYOU ALSO TALK AND WRITES, YOUR BROTHER KEVIN AND THE TWO THINGS\nWE HAVE IN COMMON, WE'RE BOTH A BUTTER KNIFE AWAY AT THE\nTHANKSGIVING DAY TABLE FROM TRUMP SUPPORTERS.\nHOW IS TRUMP DOING AMONG YOUR KIN?\n>> WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE I HAVE MY OWN LITTLE\nBASKET OF DEPLORABLES AND I READ ALL OF THESE OTHER COLUMNS WHO\nGO ON AN THROPOLOGICAL.

HE CALLED HIM FLASHY, NOT\nBRILLIANT. SO THIS CRAZY BROMANCE MAY BE\nBASED ON A MISTRANSLATION, SO HE WAS A NEW YORK DEMOCRAT.\nSO WE HAVE THESE KIND OF NEW YORK DEMOCRATS.\nSO ANYWAY, HILLARY IS, YOU KNOW, SHE IS INTO MUSCULAR\nINTERVENTION.

STEIN'S ABSENCE IS LESS OF A\nSURPRISE. HER NUMBERS HAVE REMAINED\nRELATIVELY LOW OF 3%, 4%. BUT JOHNSON'S NUMBERS HAVE BEEN\nBETTER AT 9%. BUT NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE THE\nSTAGE. HE HAS TO MEET A 15% THRESHOLD.\nSO WHAT WILL HE DO NEXT? GARY JOHNSON IS JOINING ME FROM\nLOS ANGELES. GREAT TO SEE YOU.\nTHANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. >> I HAVE A TRIVIA QUESTION FOR\nYOU. AND NOT TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT,\nBUT WAS ROSS PEROT POLLING HIGHER OR LOWER THAN ME BEFORE\nHE WAS ALLOWED IN THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE?\n>> I BELIEVE HE WAS POLLING LOWER.\nSO TELL ME WHY YOU'RE BRINGING THAT UP.\n>> WELL, JUST THAT AFTER A ROW O\nPR RPER ROW APPEARED IN THOSE DEBATE, THEY SET A THRESHOLD\nTHAT WILL NEVER PUT A THIRD PARTY ON THE STAGE AGAIN.\nAND I THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE SURPRISED BY THE FACT THAT ROSS\nPEROT WHO HAD SUCH A GOOD SHOWING AT THIS POINT PRIOR TO\nTHE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE WAS POLLING LOWER THAN I AM\nRIGHT NOW. >> THE COMMISSION ON\nPRESIDENTIAL DEBATES WAS ESTABLISHED ALMOST 30 YEARS AGO.\nTHEY SAY THEY ARE NONPARTISAN. I WOULD CALL THEM BIPABIPARTISA\nMADE UP OF DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS.\nLET ME PLAY WHAT MIKE McCURRY SAID YESTERDAY.\nHE WAS TALKING ABOUT WHY THE BAR IS SET WHERE IT IS.\nLET'S SEE IF WE CAN PLAY THAT. ACTUALLY, I DON'T THINK WE HAVE\nIT QUITE YET, BUT HE SAID THAT THEY HAD TO SET SOME SORT OF\nTHRESHOLD, SOME SORT OF CRITERIA, SO THEY SET THE 15%\nBAR MORE THAN A YEAR AGO IN ORDER TO GIVE EVERYBODY TIME TO\nMEET THE THRESHOLD. WASN'T IT A FAILURE OF YOUR\nCAMPAIGN, SIR, NOT TO MEET THE 15% MARK?\n>> YOU KNOW WHAT, HERE IS ANOTHER ISSUE, I'VE NEVER HAD AN\nISSUE WITH 15%, BUT THAT MY NAME HAS NEVER APPEARED ON THE TOP\nLINE OF ANY NATIONAL POLL. AND # 9% OF THE MEDIA ONLY\nREPORTS THE TOP LINE, SO 70% OF AMERICA RIGHT NOW DOESN'T EVEN\nKNOW I'M IN THE RACE.9# 9% OF T REPORTS THE TOP LINE, SO 70% OF\nAMERICA RIGHT NOW DOESN'T EVEN KNOW I'M IN THE RACE.9% OF THE\nREPORTS THE TOP LINE, SO 70% OF AMERICA RIGHT NOW DOESN'T EVEN\nKNOW I'M IN THE RACE. SO THAT IS MANIPULATION IN A WAY\nTHAT GOES COMPLETELY UNNOTICED BY EVERYBODY.\nIF MICKEY MOUSE WERE THE THIRD NAME, MICKEY WOULD BE AT 30\nBECAUSE MICKEY IS ANYBODY BUT. BUT MICKEY IS NOT ON THE BALLOT\nIN ALL 50 STATES AND I'M THE ONLY THIRD PARTY ALONG WITH BILL\nWELD, WE'RE THE ONLY THIRD PARTY CANDIDATES ON THE BALLOT THE IN\nALL 50 STATES. 50% OF AMERICANS WHEN THEY GO IT\nREGISTER TO VOTE ARE SAYING THAT THEY ARE INDEPENDENT.\nWHERE IS THAT REPRESENTATION? WELL, IT'S BILL WELD AND MYSELF.\n>> NO DOUBT I WANT ALL AMERICANS TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR CAMPAIGN.\nAND LET ME TRY ANOTHER SOUND BITE.\nCHRIS WALLACE WAS TALKING TO YOU ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU\nDIDN'T MAKE IT ON THE DEBATE STAGE.\nHERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. >> WOULD YOU AGREE THAT IF YOU\nDON'T GET IN TO THE DEBATES, IT'S GAME OVER?\n>> WINNINGS ELECTION, YES, I WOULD SAY GAME OVER WINNING THE\nELECTION. BUT THE PRESIDENT --\n>> WITH THAT IN MIND, WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THIS DEBATE?\nNOW THAT YOU WON'T BE ON THE STAGE, IS THE CAMPAIGN OVER?\n>> WELL, NO, THE CLOCK STILL TICKS.\nSO GETTING TO 15% AND BEING IN THE SECOND AND THIRD DEBATE, MY\nPARTNER, FIANCE, BEST FRIEND, KATE, SHE SAID GARY, THIS IS\nJUST YOUR LUCK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO HASSLE WITH THE FIRST DEBATE\nAND YOU'LL STILL GET ELECTED PRESIDENT.\n>> SOUNDS LIKE SPIN TO ME, GARY. BUT YOU'RE SAYING YOUR GOAL NOW\nIS TO GET TO THE OCTOBER DEBATES?\n>> WELL, SURE. THE CLOG DOES KEEP ON TICKING.\nAND THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME ON YOUR SHOW.\nLOOK, I'M POLLING HIGH IER THAN ROSS PEROT DID AND AT ONE POINT\nHE WAS LEADING THE CONTEST. THAT IS THE OPPORTUNITY THAT\nEXISTS IF YOU'RE IN THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES.\nIT'S NOT A TWO PARTY RACE. THERE ARE MORE IN THIS CASE BILL\nWELD AND MYSELF ARE ON THE BALLOT IN ALL 50 STATES.\nI THINK THAT SPEAKS VOLUMES. 50% OF AMERICANS WHEN THEY\nREGISTER TO VOTE ARE REGISTERS AS INDEPENDENT.\nHELP. >> LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT BILL\nWELD. IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT HE\nIS FEELING PRESSURE TO DROP OUT OF THE RACE.\nHE DOESN'T WANT TO SEE DONALD TRUMP BEING ELECTED AS A RESULT\nOF THE THIRD PARTY TAKING VOTES AROUND FROM HILLARY CLINTON.\nDO YOU FEEL PRESSURE TO WITHDRAW FROM THE RACE?\n>> ABSOLUTELY NOT. THIS IS A TWO PARTY -- THIS IS A\nPARTY THAT NEEDS TO BE RUINED. THEY HAVE DONE THIS TO\nTHEMSELVES. THEY HAVE BECOME SO POLARIZED,\nTHEIR ONLY AGENDA IS TO KILL EACH OTHER.\nWHAT ABOUT A THIRD SCENARIO IN LIEU OF TRUMP AND CLINTON WILL\nEVERYTHING WILL BE MORE POLARIZED THAN EVER?\nWHAT ABOUT A THIRD SCENARIO WHERE WELD AND I GET ELECTED BIG\nSIX LANE HIGHWAY DOWN THE MIDDLE, WE'LL HIRE REPUBLICANS,\nDEMOCRATS, EVERYBODY WILL BE LIBERTARIAN LEANING AND CALL OUT\nBOTH SIDES TO COME TO THE MIDDLE TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS THAT\nTHE COUNTRY FACES? I THINK THAT THIRD SCENARIO,\nBRIAN, HAS AT LEAST THE OPPORTUNITY -- THE BEST\nOPPORTUNITY OF SUCCEEDING. >> ARE YOU SAYING THE\nLIBERTARIAN PARTY IS THE MIDDLE BETWEEN THE DEMOCRATS AND\nREPUBLICANS? >> RIGHT NOW, A BIG SIX LANE\nHIGHWAY DOWN THE MIDDLE AT THE MOMENT.\nBIG SIX LANE. >> NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE.\n>> WELL, FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE, SMALLER GOVERNMENT, SOCIALLY\nINCLUSIVE, LET PEOPLE MAKE CHOICES IN THEIR OWN LIVES.\nSTOP WITH THESE MILITARY INTERVENTIONS, STOP SUPPORTING\nREGIME CHANGE THAT RESULTED IF A LESS SAFE WORLD AND THEN THE\nONLY FREE TRADERS OF THE THREE CANDIDATES.\nLOOK, FREE TRADE, LET'S BRING THE WORLD TOGETHER WITH FREE\nTRADE. >> YOU MENTIONED A SAFE WORLD\nAND I WANT TO GET YOUR REACTION TO THE EVENTS HERE IN NEW YORK.\nONE BOMB -- EXCUSE ME, ONE EXPLOSION, DONALD TRUMP CALLING\nIT A BOMB, HILLARY CLINTON ALSO CALLING IT A BOMBING.\nTHERE WAS ALSO THE GUYS IN A EXPLODED IN NEW JERSEY\nYESTERDAY. AND THERE WAS AN INCIDENT IN\nMINNESOTA, STABBING AT A MALL IN MINNESOTA AND THAT PERSON SHOT\nBY POLICE. TELL ME YOUR REACTION TO THESE\nNEWS STORIES FROM THE PAST 24 HOURS AND WHAT THE GOVERNMENT\nNEEDS TO BE DOING ON A DAY LIKE TODAY.\n>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, JUST GREAT IFLE THAT NOBODY GOT HURT.\nSECRETARY SECONDLY, RESPONDERS ARE ON THE\nSCENE. IF THERE IS ANYTHING THAT I\nLEARNED HAVING BEEN GOVERNOR OF NEW MEXICO FOR EIGHT YEARS, IS\nTHAT THESE PEOPLE REALLY DO CARE, THEY ARE REALLY QUALIFIED,\nTHEY REALLY DO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.\nAND BY GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL,\nLOOK, WE'LL FIND OUT WHO IS RESPONSIBLE.\nWHETHER IT IS AN INDIVIDUAL OR A GROUP.\nAND THEY WILL BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE.\nAND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT ALL OF US DEMAND.\nALL OF US. >> GARY JOHNSON, THANK YYOU VER\nMUCH FOR BEING HERE.

CARL, GREAT TO SIGHEE YOU.\nWE WERE JUST HEARING FROM GARY JOHNSON.\nI WAS CURIOUS FOR YOUR IMPRESSIONS.\nDO YOU BELIEVE THAT HE SHOULD BE ON THE DEBATE STAGE IN EIGHT\nDAYS? WE KNOW HE WON'T GET AN\nINVITATION. >> NO, THERE ARE RULES AND HE\nHASN'T MET THE 15% THRESHOLD. AND I WAS THE ONE THAT FIRST\nREPORTED I THINK THAT BILL WELD I BELIEVE IS THINKING ABOUT\nDROPPING OUT OF THIS RACE IF IT LOOKS LIKE HE AND GARY JOHNSON\nMIGHT GET DONALD TRUMP ELECTED. WELD DECEZ SPICES TRUMP.\nI DON'T THINK HE'S MADE UP HIS MIND, BUT IT'S CERTAINLY A POINT\nIF IT LOOKS LIKE SPICES TRUMP. I DON'T THINK HE'S MADE UP HIS\nMIND, BUT IT'S CERTAINLY A POINT IF IT LOOKS LIKESPICES TRUMP.\nI DON'T THINK HE'S MADE UP HIS MIND, BUT IT'S CERTAINLY A POINT\nIF IT LOOKS LIKEZES TRUMP. I DON'T THINK HE'S MADE UP HIS\nMIND, BUT IT'S CERTAINLY A POINT IF IT LOOKS LIKESES TRUMP.\nI DON'T THINK HE'S MADE UP HIS MIND, BUT IT'S CERTAINLY A POINT\nIF IT LOOKS LIKE THAT IT WOULD HELP TOUCHDOWN AND HE WOULD GO\nHELP HILLARY CLINTON. SO STAY TUNED ON THAT.\n>> INTERESTING. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE LAST SEVEN\nDAYS OF HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN.\nHER NEAR COLLAPSE LAST SUNDAY. OFF THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL FOR\nSEVERAL DAYS AND NOW BACK ON. HAS SHE FULLY RECOVERED IN A\nPOLITICAL AND MEDIA SENSE FROM WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEKEND?\n>> I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION BECAUSE THERE IS A\nMUCH LARGER QUESTION ABOUT THE OVERALL COVERAGE OF THIS\nCAMPAIGN BY THE ELECTRONIC MEDIA, BY CABLE AND NETWORK\nNEWS. WE'VE BEEN TERRIFIC AT\nINTERPRETATION AT GIVING EXTRA TIME TO DEBATE PANELS.\nBUT WE'VE BEEN POSITIVELY AWFUL IN TERMS OF REPORTING IN A\nCOHERENT WAY THE STORY OF WILL THIS CAMPAIGN, THE REAL EXISTING\nLIFE AND RECORD OF DONALD TRUMP. THE NEW YORK TIMES, \"WASHINGTON\nPOST,\" THE \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" HAVE DONE FABULOUS REPORTING ON\nTHIS. AND WE GIVE SNIPPETS OF IT.\nWE NEED TO BE DOING AN HOUR, TWO HOURS A NIGHT OF REAL BIOGRAPHY,\nRUNNING IT OVER AND OVER OF WHAT TRUMP'S LIFE AND RECORD HAVE\nBEEN ABOUT BECAUSE THEY'RE AT ABSOLUTE ODDS WITH THE MYTHICAL\nAND LYING STORY THAT HAS TOLD US.\nHE'S A CON MAN. IT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED.\nAND ALSO HE HAS PRESIDED OVER A COVER UP OF HIS OWN LIFE.\nAND WE HAVE ALLOWED IT IN CABLE NEWS AND NETWORK NEWS\nPARTICULARLY. >> HERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT.\nAND I HAVE TO PUSH BACK A LITTLE BIT.\nI SEE COMMENTS LIKE YOURS EVERY DAY AND YET YOU COULD SAY IT'S\nALL COMING FROM LIBERALS WHO DON'T WANT TO SEE TRUMP E ELECT.\nISN'T THERE A VISCERAL HATE OF TRUMP BY THE JOURNALISTS AND\nISN'T THAT SEEPING THROUGH IN THE COVERAGE?\n>> I WOULDN'T CALL IT HATRED. I THINK THAT THERE IS\nREALIZATION AND IT'S NOT JUST LIBERALS, I THINK IT'S\nCONSERVATIVE, TOO, THERE IS REALIZATION THAT TRUMP IS A CON\nMAN. AND THAT THAT IS A BIG PART OF\nTHE STORY. LOOK, WE HAVE REPORTED AND\nNOBODY HAS BEEN TOUGHER ON HILLARY CLINTON ESPECIALLY ON\nTHE SERVER QUESTION THAN I, I'VE SAID IT'S INDEFENSIBLE WHAT SHE\nDID WITH IT, AND WE HAVE REPORTED ON HER WHOLE LIFE.\nSHE HAS BEEN AROUND FOR 25, 30 YEARS IN PUBLIC ON THE PUBLIC\nSTAGE. AND WE KNOW HER EVERY POSITION\nAND RECORD AND HER LIFE. TRUMP IS DIFFERENT.\nHE'S A NEW KID ON THE BLOCK IN TERMS OF BEING IN A PRESIDENTIAL\nCAMPAIGN. WE NEED TO DO WHAT THE\n\"WASHINGTON POST\" AND \"NEW YORK TIMES\" AND THE OTHER PRINT PRESS\nOR OLD FASHIONED MEDIA HAS DONE, WHICH IS TO REPORT THE REAL\nEXISTING RECORD REPEATEDLY. THAT IS THE STORY HERE.\nAND THAT IS WHERE THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS A REALLY GOOD BEEF\nAGAINST THE MEDIA. WE HAVEN'T -- IT'S NOT EQUAL.\nIT'S DISEQUAL THAT WE HAVE ALLOWED DONALD TRUMP TO PLAY US\nLIKE THIS AND WE FOCUS ON HIS OUTRAGEOUS STATEMENTS WHICH WE\nDO EVERY DAY AND WE GIVE EQUAL TIME TO THOSE ON HIS SIDE AND\nHILLARY'S SIDE DEBATING THESE CRAZY STATEMENTS AND POSITIONS\nTHAT HE CHANGES EVERY DAY. AND WE ANALYZE THAT, BUT DO WE\nGO BACK AND LOOK AT HIS WHOLE BUSINESS RECORD?\nNO. WE DON'T.\nHOW ABOUT A REAL INVESTIGATIVE BIOGRAPHY ON MSNBC, ON CNN THAT\nRUNS EVERY NIGHT ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON,\nABOUT THEIR TWO LIVES? PUT THEM SIDE BY SIDE AND RUN IT\nEVERY NIGHT UNTIL THE DEBATES. >> LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT WHAT\nNICK KRISTOF WROTE IN THE \"NEW YORK TIMES.\"\nI THINK HE WAS CHANNELING A LOT OF THE FRUSTRATIONS SOME FEEL.\nHE SAID WHERE HE SHOULD BE GUAR, NOT LAP DOGS.\nFOR MY PART, I'VE NEVER MET A NATIONAL POLL COITICIAN AS I WI\nINFORMED AND DECENT SIF AS TRUMP.\nHE'S NOT NORMAL. AND SOMEHOW THAT IS WHAT OUR\nBARKS NEED TO C CONVEY. HE'S AN OPINION JOURNALIST, BUT\nDO YOU THINK JOURNALISTS WHO TRY TO BE FAIR TO BOTH SIDES ARE\nFAILING BY NOT CALLING THIS STUFF OUT?\n>> I THINK AGAIN THE QUESTION OF DONALD TRUMP'S STABILITY,\nPREPARATION, KNOWLEDGE, IGNORANCE IF IT WERE THAT, IS A\nBIG PART OF THE STORY. WE'VE NEVER HAD A CANDIDATE\nBEFORE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT CERTAINLY IN THE MODERN AGE WHO\nTHERE ARE SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS STABILITY.\n>> HOLD ON. ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT HIS MENTAL\nSTABILITY? WHAT ARE YOU SAYING THERE?\n>> ABOUT HIS ABILITY TO DEAL WITH PROBLEMS IN A LEVEL-HEADED\nWAY, THE PROBLEMS OF THE KIND THAT THE PRESIDENCY THROWS AT\nSOMEONE. IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT RESPONDING.\nBUT AGAIN, LET'S LOOK AT HIS RECORD.\n>> BUT I CAN HEAR TRUMP SUPPORTERS YELLING AT THE TV\nRIGHT NOW SAYING THAT YOU AND I AND EVERYBODY ON CNN IS PART OF\nTHE PROBLEM. THAT'S WHY TRUMP ATTACKS CNN ON\nTWITTER ALL TIME. HE THINKS WE'RE RELENTLESSLY\nAGAINST HIM. >> FIRST OF ALL, LOOK AT HOW WE\nGAVE HIM ALL THE AIR TIME WE HAVE AND PARTICULARLY DURING THE\nPERIOD WHEN HE WAS SEEK THE NOMINATION.\nWE GAVE HIM MORE FREE AIR TIME THAN ANY CANDIDATE HAS RECEIVED\nIN HISTORY. WE DID NOT GIVE HILLARY CLINTON\nEQUAL AMOUNTS OF TIME. LOOK, I'M SAYING PUT THE TWO OF\nTHEM UP THERE NEXT TO EACH OTHER IN TERMS OF THEIR RECORD, THEIR\nLIVES. DO IT AS DOCUMENTARY FORM.\nAND THAT IS FAIR, IT IS, QUOTE, OBJECTIVE, IT'S WHAT WE NEED TO\nBE DOING BECAUSE HIS LIFE IS THE NEW REAL STORY AND HIS BUSINESS\nRECORD. >> CARL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR\nSHARING THESE THOUGHTS. PLEASE STICK AROUND.\nUP NEXT HERE THOUGH, WHY SO MANY AMERICANS THINK THAT WE ARE UP\nRELIABLE SOURCES. A NEW POLL SHOWS RECORD LOW\nLEVEL TRUST OF MEDIA AND GUESS WHO IS TAKING CREDIT FOR THAT.\nWE'LL TALK ABOUT WHAT REPORTERS CAN DO TO TURN IT AROUND.                \u00e2\u0099\u00aa\u00e2\u0099\u00aa",

WE ACTUALLY DO WORK FOR THE\nVIEWERS ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES WE DON'T DO A GOOD JOB OF\nEXPLAINING THAT AND SHOWING IT. DAVID, LET ME GO BACK TO YOU.\nWHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE YOUR COLLEAGUES DO A LITTLE\nDIFFERENTLY TO TRY TO EARN BACK PEOPLE'S TRUST?\n>> I THINK WE'RE WORKING REALLY HARD.\nPEOPLE AT THE \"POST\" AS FAR AS I KNOW AND I'VE SEEN THIS EFFORT\nGOING ON FOR MONTHS ARE WRITING ABOUT ALL THESE THINGS THAT\nTRUMP SAYS AND DOES. I THINK THAT WE'VE PUT A LOT OF\nIT OUT THERE. THE KEY IS TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT\nAND I THINK PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO DO THIS, WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN\nTRUMP SAYS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT THE TRUE AND SAYS IT AGAIN AND\nDEPEND AND GO AGAIN. AND WHAT WE'VE DONE, WHEN TRUMP\nLIE, WE CALL IT A LIE. THERE IS NO EUPHEMISM.\nIT'S TOO OBVIOUS. BEFORE WE WANTED THE CANDIDATE\nTO SHOW SHAME AND NOW YOU'RE HE SEEING THE MEDIA PUSH THE\nCANDIDATE TO A HIGHER STANDARD. >> LYNN, WHEN IS A LIE A LIE?\nHOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS IN A PERSON'S HEART OR SOUL OR MIND?\n>> WELL, THIS IS NOW KIND OF A NEW POSITION FOR ME THAT YOU\nMAKE THE CALL. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE PAID DO.\nESPECIALLY ONCE THE RIDSE OF SOCIAL MEDIA CAME, WHAT IS THE\nVALUE AND HEED FOR A PROFESSIONAL JOU JOURNALIST WHO\nMORE RESOURCES? YOU MAKE THE CALL.\nIF YOU POSTHINK THE WORD LIE, I CON NOTATES MOTIVATION, THEN WE\nCOULD SAY HERE IS A STATEMENT THAT IS NOT TRUE.NOTATES MOTIVA\nCOULD SAY HERE IS A STATEMENT THAT IS NOT TRUE.\nTHERE ARE WAYS TO DO THIS. WE'RE WRITERS.\nWE CAN FIGURE THIS OUT. AND I THINK THE OTHER THING DO\nIS VERY SPECIAL, RULE NUMBER ONE THAT I ALWAYS SEE VIOLATED, BACK\nEACH OTHER UP IN PRESS CONFERENCES.\nDO MORE FOLLOWUP. >> THAT IS INTERESTING.\n>> YOU HEARD ME EARLIER THIS WEEK WHEN DONALD TRUMP TOLD DR.\nOZ THAT MOVING YOUR ARMS IS EXERCISE AND HE DIDN'T DID A\nFOLLOWUP QUESTION? OF COURSE THAT IS PREPOSTEROUS.\nAND I WOULD INVITE PEOPLE IN OTHER KINDS OF SHOWS.\nJIMMY KIMMEL AND FALLON, IT'S FUN.\nI'M NOT AGAINST A FUN THING OF TOSSING DONALD TRUMP'S HAIR OR\nASKING A LIGHTHEARTED QUESTION. BUT THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO\nASK DIFFERENT KINDS OF QUESTIONS AND NOT JUST BE FAWNING\nTHROUGHOUT THE WHOM ELE INTERVI. SO EVERYBODY HAS TO GET UP THE\nGAME TO GET MORE INFORMATION. AND FOR VIEWER, IT DOESN'T MEAN\nWE'RE FOR OR AGAINST ANYONE. JUST GET BEING MORE FACTS OUT.\nLEARN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT A PERSON SO WE SHOULD USE THE\nOPPORTUNITIES TO BACK EACH OTHER UP, BREAK DOWN QUESTIONS, AND\nCONFRONT IN THE FOLLOW-UP QUESTION AND SEE WHAT THEY SAY.\n>> AND BRIAN, JUST AS A FOLLOW-UP TO HER POINT OF\nBACKING EACH OTHER UP, TRUMP OVER THE COURSE OF HIS CAMPAIGN\nHAS BANNED A NUMBER OF MEDIA OUTLETS FROM PRESS CONFERENCES\nOR COVERAGE. IN MY IDEAL WORLD OF COURAGE, IF\nYOU WERE A SIMILAR MEDIA OUTLET, MAYBE YOU SAY THEN WE'RE NOT\nGOING TO COVER YOU EITHER. I KNOW THAT IS WISHFUL THINKING\nIN THE DAYS OF WE CAN GET AN OPPORTUNITY THAT SOMEONE ELSE\nCAN'T, BUT THAT I THINK WOULD REALLY SEND A MESSAGE THAT YOU\nDON'T GET TO SILENCE THE PRESS. IF YOU SILENCE ONCE OF US, YOU\nSILENCE ALL OF US. AND THAT'S THE DANGER THAT\nPEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHEN THEY LOOK AT FRTRUMP'S ACTION.\n>> AND IF CLINTON OR OBAMA WERE DOING THE SAME THING, MAYBE THE\nSAME RULES WOULD APPLY. HAS THE RELAXING OF THE BLACK\nLIST HELPED YOU GET MORE INFORMATION IN THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN? >> NO, NOT AT ALL.\nI GOT NO INFORMATION BEFORE AND BASICALLY NO INFORMATION NOW.\nONE OF THE THINGS I'VE TRIED TO DO IS STARTED TO POST THE\nQUESTIONS THAT I SEND THEM. I DO THAT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT\nTHEM TO TAKE THE THINGS THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME AND\nGIVE IT TO OTHER MEDIA AS A WAY OF SAYING THAT I DIDN'T ASK THEM\nFOR THE RIGHT QUESTIONS. SO I WANT TO SOHOW MY WORK TO\nSHOW THE RESPONSES I'M NOT GETTING.\n>> AND THERE IS AN EXAMPLE ON SCREEN.\nTHANK YOU ALL. GREAT TALKING WITH YOU.\nAND ONE MORE NOTE ABOUT THE CAMPAIGNS, IT IS THE FIRST RULE\nOF CAMPAIGN COVERAGE, JOURNAL IGS SHOULD ALWAYS WANT MORE\nACCESS AND POLITICIANS ALMOST ALWAYS WANT TO GIVE LESS.\nBUT TRUMP REALLY REVISED THAT RULE GIVING HUNDREDS AND\nHUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF INTERVIEWS IN THE 15 MONTHS\nSINCE HE'S BEEN A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.\nDON'T YOU THINK IT'S HIGH TIME TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE\nPRESENT AND THE PAST? LISTEN TO THESE DISINGENUOUS\nCOMMENTS FROM FOX AND FRIENDS >> DONALD TRUMP HAS TALKED TO\nTHE PRESS OVER AND OVER. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF\nMINUTES THEY'VE SPENT WITH THE PRESS, STANDING THERE AND TAKING\nQUESTIONS, HE SPENT 4 HOURS AND 38 MINUTES THIS YEAR TALKING TO\nTHE PRESS ANSWERING QUESTIONS BECAUSE HE WANTS TO BE\nTRANSPARENT. >> SURE.\nAND THE TRUMP NUMBER DOES NOT INCLUDE HOURS THAT HE'S APPEARED\nON NETWORK TELEVISION ANSWERING QUESTIONS AS WELL.\n>> RIGHT. >> NOW, IT IS TRUE THAT TRUMP\nUSED TO GIVE INTERVIEWS CONSTANTLY.\nMUCH OF HIS CAMPAIGN WAS PREMISED ON CONSTANT MEDIA\nEXPOSURE. BUT I SAID WAS BECAUSE IT'S NO\nLONGER IT ER THE CASE. TRUMP SUPPORTERS ARGUE HE'S MORE\nACCESSIBLE THAN HILLARY CLINTON AND HE IS GIVING INTERVIEWS TO\nFRIENDLY OUTLETS. HE'S BEEN TURNING DOWN SUNDAY\nSHOWS LIKE \"MEET THE PRESS.\" HE'S NOT BEEN SUBJECTED TO MANY\nREAL INTERVIEWS SINCE THE MIDDLE OF THE SUMMER.\nWHEN YOU NOTICE HE'S ON FOX, APPEARING ON FOX ALL THE TIME\nRALLYING UP HIS BASE, YOU SHOULD ALSO NOTICE WHAT HE'S NOT DOING\nAND HOW HE'S NOT AS ACCESSIBLE AS THE SURROGATES SAY HE IS.\nWE CAN SAY THE SAME ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON.\nIT'S IMPORTANT FOR HER TO CONTINUE TO GRANT INTERVIEWS AS\nWELL. SHE DIDN'T HAVE PRESS\nCONFERENCES FOR THE BETTER PART OF A YEAR AND LATELY SHE HAS\nBEEN TAKING MORE QUESTIONS FROM REPORTS.\nHOPEFULLY THAT WILL CONTINUE. AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER IN THE\nSHOW, IT'S BEEN ALMOST TWO MONTHS SINCE DONALD TRUMP HELD A\nPRESS CONFERENCE. BOTH THESE CANDIDATES STILL\nDESERVE TO ANSWER AND SHOULD BE ANSWERING MORE QUESTIONS FROM\nREPORTERS. COMING UP HERE ON \"RELIABLE\nSOURCES SOURCES.\"\nMOMENTS AWAY FROM A PRESS CONFERENCE ON LAST NIGHT'S\nEXPLOSION IN NEW YORK CITY. IN THE MEANTIME, WE'LL TALK\nABOUT HOW THE MEDIA IS HANDLING THIS LATEST STORY.\nWHETHER THERE'S AN OVERREACTION HAPPENING.\nWE'LL GET TO THAT IN A MOMENT.",

HOW DO WE KEEP PERSPECTIVE WHEN\nOUR MEDIA CULTURE MAKES THINGS SEEM TO BIG, SO LOUD, SO SCARY\nIN A SITUATION LIKE THIS? >> IT'S VERY MUCH A CHALLENGE.\nI THINK PEOPLE WOULD BE -- I ALMOST WISH YOU COULD BOTTLE IT\nAND SORT OF SHARE IT WITH OTHER PEOPLE THE WAY REAL NEW YORKERS\nACT WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS.\nIN PART WE'RE A LITTLE BIT SHELL SHOCKED BECAUSE WE'VE HAD SO\nMUCH TRAUMA BETWEEN HURRICANE SANDY, THE TWO WORLD TRADE\nCENTER ATTACKS AND ON AND ON, BUT THE REALITY IS IF YOU'RE\nLIVING IN A CITY WITH CONSTANT SPEC\nSPECTACLE, WHETHER IT'S A POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE SPECTACLE,\nPEOPLE FIGURE OUT THAT AFTER A WHILE THAT THEIR LIVES ARE NOT\nNECESSARILY GOING TO BE COMPLETELY KNOCKED OFF BALANCE.\n>> I GUESS -- I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT.\nI WAS GOING TO SAY TO CARL, I GUESS THE POINT IS IT'S ABOUT\nREACTING BUT NOT OVERREACTING TO THESE SORTS OF THREATS.\n>> I WATCHED BOTH CNN AND MSNBC LAST NIGHT, AND I THOUGHT THAT\nBOTH DID A TERRIFIC JOB. THE ANCHORS, DON LEMON WAS\nTERRIFIC IN PUTTING IT INTO PERSPECTIVE AND SAYING LET'S\nKEEP CALM ABOUT ALL THIS. I THINK THIS IS USUALLY WHEN\nWE'RE AT OUR BEST, ESPECIALLY CABLE NEWS.\nWE HAVE A LOT OF REPORTERS. THEY GO ON THE STREET.\nTHEY DO BASIC POLICE REPORTING. THEY TALK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON.\nTHIS STORY HAS A LITTLE BIT OF AN ADDED DIMENSION IN A\nPOLITICAL REACTION BY THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES, BUT I'M\nNOT GOING TO SIT HERE AND BE CRITICAL OF WHAT WE'VE DONE ON\nTHIS STORY FOR A MINUTE. I THINK IT'S BEEN RESTRAINED AND\nREALLY GOOD. >> SAME WORD THAT APPLIES TO THE\nPOLITICAL COVERAGE, PROPORTIONALITY.\nGENTLEMEN, I'M OUT OF TIME BUT THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.\nSTAY TUNED TO CNN. AFTER THE BREAK JAKE TAPPER\nCONTINUES OUR COVERAGE OF THIS STORY WITH THIS PRESS CONFERENCE\nIN NEW YORK. STAY TUNED.",

              "text": ">>> THIS IS CNN BREAKING NEWS.\n>> HELLO P.M. I'M JAKE TAPPER IN WASHINGTON, D.C., WHERE THE\nSTATE OF OUR UNION IS ON EDGE. WE ARE STANDING BY FOR A NEWS\nCONFERENCE WHERE NEW YORK CITY'S MAYOR AND NEW YORK CITY POLICE\nOFFICIALS WILL UPDATE US ON THE INVESTIGATION INTO LAST NIGHT'S\nEXPLOSION IN MANHATTAN. 29 PEOPLE WERE INJURED IN THE\nBLAST, WHICH NEW YORK MAYOR BILL de BLASIO DESCRIBES AS AN\nINTENTIONAL ACT. POLICE FOUND A SECOND DEVICE, A\nPRESSURE COOKER CONNECTED TO A CELL PHONE JUST BLOCKS AWAY.\nA SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL TELLS CNN INVESTIGATORS\nHAVE NOT YET FOUND ANY GOOD SURVEILLANCE VIDEO FROM EITHER\nLOCATION. GOVERNOR ANDREW CUOMO BRIEFED\nREPORTERS A SHORT TIME AGO. >> AT THIS TIME THERE'S NO\nEVIDENCE OF AN INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM CONNECTION WITH THIS\nINCIDENT. >> CRIME LAB INVESTIGATORS ARE\nCHECKING TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN THE MANHATTAN\nBLAST AND AN EXPLOSION IN NEW JERSEY YESTERDAY.\nSOMEONE THERE IN THE GARDEN STATE PLANTED THREE PIPE BOMBS\nIN A TRASH CAN ALONG THE ROUTE OF A CHARITY MARINE CORPS RACE\nON THE JERSEY SHORE. ONLY ONE OF THE DEVICES\nDETONATED AND FORM NO ONE WAS INJURED, LIKELY BECAUSE A\nDELAYED START IN THE RACE MEANT THE RUNNERS HAD NOT YET GATHERED\nWHEN THE BOMB WENT OFF. THERE'S ALSO SOME BREAKING NEWS\nIN THE INVESTIGATION INTO YESTERDAY'S ATTACK AT A\nMINNESOTA SHOPPING MALL. A STATEMENT POSTED ONLINE TODAY\nBY A MEDIA WING OF ISIS CLAIMS THAT THE ATTACKER WAS, QUOTE, A\nSOLDIER OF THE ISLAMIC STATE. WITNESSES SAY THAT THE MAN ASKED\nAT LEAST ONE OF HIS VICTIMS IF HE OR SHE WERE MUSLIM BEFORE HE\nATTACKED. AN OFF-DUTY OFFICER KILLED THE\nMAN, WHO POLICE SAY WAS KNOWN TO THEM.\nONE OF THE EIGHT PEOPLE WOUNDED IN THE ATTACK REMAINS\nHOSPITALIZED. THE OTHERS HAVE BEEN RELEASED.\nAS WE AWAIT THIS PRESS CONFERENCE FROM THE NYPD AND\nFROM NEW YORK CITY MAYOR BILL de BLASIO LET'S BRING IN JESSICA\nSCHNEIDER. JESSICA, NEW YORK GOVERNOR CUOMO\nJUST TOLD REPORTSER THERE IS FAR THEY DO NOT KNOW OF ANY LINK\nWITH INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. WAS THERE ANY OTHER NEW\nINFORMATION HE SHARED? >> Reporter: YOU KNOW, GOVERNOR\nCUOMO, JAKE, SAID THAT THE PROPERTY DAMAGE AT THE BUILDING\nWHERE THIS EXPLOSION OCCURRED IS SIGNIFICANT.\nTHE EXPLOSION OCCURRING JUST DOWN WEST 23rd STREET NEAR 6th\nAVENUE. THE GOVERNOR SAYING BECAUSE OF\nTHAT SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY DAMAGE, IT'S LUCKY THAT THERE\nWERE NO FATALITIES HERE. THERE WERE, IN FACT, 29 PEOPLE\nINJURED, BUT ALL 29 OF THESE PEOPLE WHO WERE TREATED AT LOCAL\nHOSPITALS HAVE ALL BEEN TREATED AND RELEASED.\nSO NO MAJOR INJURIES. NOW, AS FOR THE INVESTIGATION,\nIT'S PRETTY MUCH TWOFOLD. IT'S FOCUSED ON FORENSICS AND\nSURVEILLANCE. THE EXPLOSIVE DEVICE THAT WENT\nOFF JUST DOWN THE STREET HERE AS WELL AS THAT PRESSURE COOKER\nTHAT WAS FOUND FOUR BLOCKS NORTH OF HERE ON WEST 27th, BOTH OF\nTHOSE AND THE DEBRIS FROM IT HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO FBI LAB.\nTHE FBI LAB DOWN IN QUANTICO, VIRGINIA.\nTHEY'LL BE ANALYZED. BUT GOVERNOR CUOMO SAYING IT\nDOES NOT LOOK LIKE THE DEVICES HERE IN MANHATTAN WERE AT ALL\nCONNECTED TO THE ONES DOWN IN SEASIDE PARK, NEW JERSEY, OR ONE\nOF THOSE PIPE BOMBS THAT WENT OFF BEFORE THE MARINE CORPS\nCHARITY RUN. IN ADDITION, THE INVESTIGATORS\nARE LOOKING AT THE SURVEILLANCE VIDEO.\nTHIS IS A VERY BUSY AREA OF MANHATTAN ON A SATURDAY NIGHT.\nINVESTIGATORS ARE SIFTING THROUGH SOME OF THE SURVEILLANCE\nVIDEO. WE'VE LEARNED THAT THEY HAVE\nSPOTTED AN INDIVIDUAL IN THAT SURVEILLANCE VIDEO WHO WAS IN\nTHE APPROXIMATE LOCATION OF THE VIDEO BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR IF THE\nPERSON IS CONNECTED TO THE EXPLOSION.\nSOME OF THE OTHER VIDEO A BIT GRAINY AND NOT OFFERING A LOT OF\nCLUES AS OF YET AS TO HOW EXACTLY THIS TRANSSPPIRED AND W\nMAY BE RESPONSIBLE. >> I'M JOINED BY CNN JUSTICE\nCORRESPONDENT EVAN PEREZ. EVAN, BAD NEWS ABOUT THE\nSURVEILLANCE VIDEO APPARENTLY RIGHT NOW, BUT I KNOW LAW\nENFORCEMENT IS HOPING THAT THAT SECOND PRESSURE COOKER MIGHT\nPROVIDE SOME CLUES. WHAT ARE YOUR SOURCES TELLING\nYOU? >> THAT'S RIGHT.\nI THINK THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT TO WORK WITH, JAKE.\nONE OF THE THINGS THAT, FRANKLY, IS LUCKY HERE, THERE'S NO DEATHS\nTHAT HAVE RESULTED FROM THIS, BUT THE DEVICE THAT WAS\nRECOVERED IS ON ITS WAY TO QUANTICO WHERE THEY WILL BE ABLE\nTO RECOVER A LOT OF INFORMATION, NOT ONLY PERHAPS WHERE THE\nPRESSURE COOKER WAS BOUGHT, WHICH IS ONE WAY YOU CAN MAYBE\nTRACE TO SEE WHO MIGHT HAVE BOUGHT THIS AND MIGHT HAVE HAD\nSOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS, BUT ALSO IF THAT HE IS ANY DNA THAT\nWAS LEFT BEHIND BY THE BOMBMAKER.\nTHE STATEMENT SING W-- SAME THIH THE ONE IN SEASIDE PARK.\nONE DEVICE WENT OFF, TWO DID NOT.\nTHE MAKEUP IS BEING LOOKED AT BY THE FBI.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MINNESOTA ATTACK BECAUSE ISIS'\nMEDIA ARM CLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY SAYING THAT THIS\nINDIVIDUAL WAS A SOLDIER OF THE ISLAMIC STATE, WAS AN ISIS\nTERRORIST. WHAT MORE DO WE KNOW ABOUT THIS?\n>> WELL, I THINK WHAT THE FBI HAS AT THIS POINT IS THERE'S NO\nREASON TO DOUBT WHAT THE ISIS MEDIA PEOPLE SAY, AND THE\nLANGUAGE THEY USE, WHICH IS A SOLDIER OF THE ISLAMIC STATE, IS\nTHE TYPICAL LANGUAGE THEY USE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE INSPIRED.\nIN OTHER WORDS, THEY'RE NOT DIRECTED.\nTHIS IS THE LANGUAGE THEY USE WHEN THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO MAY\nHAVE SENT SOME KIND OF MESSAGE RIGHT BEFORE THEY CARRIED OUT\nTHEIR ATTACK. THEY MIGHT HAVE POSTED SOMETHING\nSOMEWHERE SAYING I'M DOING THIS IN THE NAME OF AND THEN THEY GO\nOUT AND DO THEIR THING. IT APPEARS TO BE THAT WOULD BE\nTHE CASE. AGAIN, THERE'S TONS OF THESE\nPEOPLE OUT THERE WHO COULD BE INSPIRED TO ACT WITHOUT ANYONE\nKNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT IT BEFORE HAND.\n>> IT SEEMS HARD TO BELIEVE ALL THREE INCIDENTS HAPPENING ON THE\nSAME DAY WOULD BE JUST A COINCIDENCE.\n>> RIGHT, EXACTLY. THIS IS WHAT ISIS HAS BEEN\nFRANKLY PRODDING ITS MEMBERS TO DO OR ITS SUPPORTERS TO DO.\nIF YOU'RE IN THE WEST, ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THEY'RE\nLOSING TERRITORY AND IT'S HARDER FOR THEM TO -- FOR THEIR\nRECRUITS TO GET THERE. ALMOST WEEKLY YOU SEE THOSE\nMESSAGES OUT THERE. THIS IS WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING\nFOR. THEY SEE ONE THING GO OFF, IT'S\nALMOST LIKE A CALL FOR THEM TO GO OUT AND DO SOMETHING AT THE\nSAME TIME. >> INTERESTING.\nMAYBE THE FIRST ONE CREATED A TEMPTATION --\n>> VERY MUCH THE MODUS OPERANDI. >> LET'S BRING IN OUR EXPERTS\nRIGHT NOW. WE HAVE WITH US JULIETTE KAYYEM,\nA FORMER ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND\nSECURITY. ALSO TOM FUENTES, A CNN NATIONAL\nSECURITY ANALYST AND FORMER FBI ASSISTANT DIRECTOR.\nWE ALSO HAVE WITH US FORMER CIA OPERATIVE BOB BAER WHO WAS WITH\nTHE CIA AND IS A CNN INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY\nANALYST. BOB, LET ME JUST START WITH YOU.\nDO YOU THINK, I MEAN, WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING, BUT IS IT LIKELY\nTHAT THESE THREE INCIDENT ALL HAPPENING THE SAME DAY WOULD BE\nRELATED EVEN IF JUST THE FIRST ONE INSPIRED THE OTHER TWO TO\nACT? >> WELL, JAKE, IT'S A LITTLE TOO\nMANY COINCIDENCES FOR ME. I MEAN, YOU HAVE NEW JERSEY\nLATER THAT NIGHT, NEW YORK, TWO BOMBS, AND THEN MINNESOTA.\nTHERE COULD BE SOME CALL OUT THERE BY THE ISLAMIC STATE, BUT\nIN THE NEW YORK BOMBING, THE PRESSURE COOKER, THERE'S BEEN NO\nCLAIM. THESE THINGSHE'SY TO MAKE.\nIT COULD BE ANYTHING FROM A PSYCHOPATH TO A DOMESTIC GROUP.\nTHE IMPORTANT THING IS TO CHECK THE WIRING, AND THAT WILL TELL\nUS A LOT. IT WILL LINK US TO THE BOSTON\nBOMBINGS IN 2013 OR MAYBE NOT. SO WE REALLY HAVE TO WAIT FOR\nTHE FORENSICS WHETHER YOU CAN EVEN BEGIN TO CALL THIS\nINTERNATIONAL TERRORISM OR SOMETHING DOMESTIC.\n>> AND JULIETTE KAYYEM, EVAN PEREZ SAYING ISIS USING THE\nLANGUAGE, A SOLDIER OF THE ISLAMIC STATE, SUGGESTS THAT\nTHIS INDIVIDUAL WHO CARRIED OUT THESE HORRIFIC STAPINGS IN\nMINNESOTA YESTERDAY WAS INSPIRED BY ISIS BUT NOT NECESSARILY\nTRAINED OR SENT BY ISIS. >> RIGHT.\nAND THAT'S THE MORE TYPICAL SORT OF INCIDENT THESE DAYS.\nACTUALLY, WE TEND TO TALK ABOUT ISIS DIRECTED AND ISIS INSPIRED.\nWE ACTUALLY ARE BEGINNING TO SEE A THIRD WAVE.\nI CALL IT ISIS JUSTIFIED. PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO CONNECT WITH\nISIS BUT AT THE LAST MOMENT SAY I'M A MEMBER OF ISIS OR, YOU\nKNOW, I SUPPORT ISIS AND THEN DO SOMETHING VIOLENT AND ATTACK.\nI HAVE TO SAY BECAUSE MINNESOTA SAID THIS GUY WAS ON SOME SORT\nOF RADAR SCREEN, THEY WERE POSSIBLY MONITORING HIM AS\nPOTENTIALLY ISIS INSPIRED BUT NO EVIDENCE OF ISIS DIRECTED, THIS\nIS THE COMMON SORT OF M.O. OF BOTH ISIS BUT THOSE WHO ARE\nFOLLOWING THEM ONLINE AND THEN DO, YOU KNOW, SERIOUS INJURY TO\nOTHERS. >> AND TOM FUENTES, AS A FORMER\nFBI TOP OFFICIAL, TELL US WHAT YOU THINK IS GOING ON RIGHT\nTHERE, RIGHT NOW AT THE FBI IN TERMS OF THEIR CONCERN.\nTHREE ATTACKS. THANKFULLY AS OF NOW NO\nFATALITIES OF INNOCENT PEOPLE, BUT THIS HAS GOT TO BE A\nCONCERN. >> IT IS, JAKE.\nAND BESIDES THE REGULAR INVESTIGATION, THE FORENSICS AND\nTHE DEVICE THAT IS WILL BE CONDUCTED AT QUANTICO, THE OTHER\nEXAMINATION IS GOING TO BE EXTENSIVE ON SOCIAL MEDIA.\nDID A CALL GO OUT? PAUL CRUICKSHANK CNN TERRORISM\nANALYST REMINDED ME THAT YESTERDAY WAS THE ANNIVERSARY OF\nTHE SIGNING OF THE U.S. CONSTITUTION.\nMAYBE THERE'S MESSAGES THAT WENT OUT BY ISIS CALLING FOR AN\nATTACK YESTERDAY OF ANYBODY OUGHT THERE THAT WAS LISTENING.\nIT'S POSSIBLE THAT'S THE COINC\nCOINCIDENCE. EVEN IF IT'S NOT THE SAME\nINDIVIDUAL OR GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS, THEY WERE LED TO DO\nTHESE ATTACKS ON THE SAME DAY. >> BOB, WHAT IS THE LIKELIHOOD\nDO YOU THINK THAT THERE IS EVIDENCE ON ANY OF THE THREE\nREMAINING DEVICES THAT DID NOT GO OFF.\nTHE TWO IN NEW JERSEY, THE ONE IN NEW YORK, THAT WOULD ALLOW\nCOUNTER TRIRMOS TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHO DID THIS EVEN\nWITHOUT ANY DEFEND SURVEILLANCE VIDEO?\n>> OH, JAKE, I THINK SO FOR SURE.\nONCE IT'S IN THE HANDS OF THE FBI, THEIR EXPERTS, THEY KNOW\nWHAT THEY'RE DOING. THEY WILL BE ABLE TO TELL US\nWHETHER IT'S TAKEN OFF THE INTERNET OR IF THERE'S A\nSIGNATURE THAT SUGGESTS A GROUP. I THINK WE'LL GET OUR BEST\nINFORMATION FROM THAT ANALYSIS AND, YOU KNOW, CONNECTED\nANYWHERE ELSE FROM, YOU KNOW, PRESSURE COOKERS IN STOCKHOLM TO\nPARIS AND THE REST OF THEM, WHAT BOMBS DIDN'T GO OFF.\nTHIS IS GOING TO BE KEY IN THE INVESTIGATION.\n>> AND WHAT, JULIETTE, CAN BE DONE IF THESE THREE INCIDENT\nWERE ALL INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE ISIS INSPIRED?\nTHAT IS TO SAY, INDIVIDUALS THAT HAD NEVER REALLY COMMUNICATED\nWITH ANY TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS, INDIVIDUALS WHO\nHAD NEVER TRAVELED ABROAD. IF THEY ARE JUST HOME GROWN\nTERRORISTS ACTING ALONE TAKING INFORMATION OFF THE INTERNET,\nWHAT MORE CAN BE DONE TO PREVENT THAT TYPE OF ATTACK?\n>> THAT'S THE CHALLENGE THAT WE ARE CONFRONTING OVERALL NOT JUST\nIN WHAT HAPPENED IN THE LAST 24 HOURS.\nSO THERE'S TWO PIECES TO IT. ONE IS IN ALMOST ALL THESE CASES\nSOMEONE KNOWS. SO THIS IS WHAT WE CALL\nENCOUNTERING VIOLENT EXTREMISM, WORKING WITH COMMUNITIES THAT\nMAY KNOW THESE INDIVIDUALS AND HAVING THEM FEEL COMFORTABLE\nCOMING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER PIECE\nWHICH IS JUST ACCESS TO BOMBMAKING MATERIAL, GUNS,\nWHATEVER IS BEING USED BY THOSE WHO ARE PERFORMING THIS KIND OF\nVIOLENCE. YOU WANT TO GET THE IDEOLOGY AND\nTHE MEANS SIMULTANEOUSLY. BUT AS YOU KNOW, NO SECURITY\nAPPARATUS, I CAN'T SAY THIS ENOUGH, NO SECURITY APPARATUS IS\nGOING TO BE ABLE TO STOP THE NEXT 22-YEAR-OLD GUY OR WHOEVER\nIT IS GETTING RADICALIZED, GETTING WEAPONS, AND GOING TO\nANY NUMBER OF SOFT TARGETS. LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN\nCHELSEA AND A SUBURBAN SHOPPING MALL IN MINNESOTA.\nSO THAT'S THE CHALLENGE THAT WE CONFRONT OVERALL.\nAND I HAVE TO SAY AGAIN WE DON'T KNOW WHAT EACH OF THESE\nINCIDENTS ARE OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS.\n>> AND TOM FUENTES, THE PRESSURE COOKER BOMBS THAT WERE BUILT TO\nKILL THE THREE INNOCENT PEOPLE AT THE BOSTON MARATHON BOMB M\nBOMBING IN 2013, THE INSTRUCTIONS WERE SAID TO HAVE\nCOME FROM ONE OF THE ISIS AFFILIATED PUBLICATIONS ONLINE.\n>> AL QAEDA. >> AL QAEDA?\n>> \"INSPIRE\" MAGAZINE, AN ARTICLE THEY PUT OUT CALLED\nMAKING A BOMB IN THE KITCHEN OF YOUR MOM.\n>> THAT'S THE ONE THE TSARNAEV BROTHERS USED?\n>> YES. THAT'S BEFORE ISIS EVEN EXISTED.\n>> THE QUESTION I WANT TO ASK THOUGH IS WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT\nTHAT KIND OF INFORMATION OUT THERE ON THE INTERNET?\nOBVIOUSLY YOU CAN'T TAKE IT DOWN.\nIT JUST WILL POP UP SOMEWHERE ELSE.\n>> NO. >> IS COUNTERTERRORISM, IS LAW\nENFORCEMENT MONITORING WHO IS LOOKING AT IT?\nARE THEY WATCHING PEOPLE ALONG THOSE LINES OR DO YOU NEED TO\nGET A SPECIAL WARRANT FOR THAT SORT OF THING?\n>> WELL, THERE'S TENS OF THOUSANDS OF THESE MESSAGES\nGOING OUT EVERY DAY FROM ISIS AND BEFORE THAT A CERTAIN AMOUNT\nFROM AL QAEDA. IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO\nMONITOR WHO IS ON THE RECEIVING END OF ALL OF THAT.\nWHO HAS INTERNET ACCESS OR ACCESS TO MAGAZINES THAT ARE\nSTILL AVAILABLE EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE MADE BY AL AWLAKI IN YEMEN.\nTHEY'RE STILL OUT THERE AND GOING TO BE OUT THERE.\nIT'S HARD AND VERY HARD FOR THE BUREAU TO READ THE MIND WHO IS\nLOOKING AT THAT AND DECIDING TO PUT A DEVICE LIKE THAT TOGETHER.\nTHIS IS NOT A NUCLEAR WEAPON. THESE ARE READILY AVAILABLE\nCOMPONENTS YOU CAN GET IN AN APPLIANCE STORE.\nYOU CAN ORDER EVERYTHING. >> Narrator: L-- ONLINE EXCEPT\nTHE BLACK POWDER AND THAT'S READILY AVAILABLE AS WELL.\nEVERYTHING THAT'S NEEDED A READILY AVAILABLE OR LES EYE\nMANUFACTURED. >> AND THAT'S WHY THIS BECOMES\nMORE OF AN INTELLIGENCE CHALLENGE THAN A LAW ENFORCEMENT\nCHALLENGE BECAUSE YOU CANNOT BAN THE SALE OF PRESSURE COOKERS AND\nMANY COMMON CHEMICALS. >> YEAH, JAKE, EXACTLY.\nBUT ALSO YOU DON'T NEED A WHOLE LOT OF TRAINING IN MAKING ONE OF\nTHESE THINGS. THEY'RE VERY EASY.\nTHEY'RE BASED ON ENERGY BUILDUP INSIDE THE PRESSURE COOKER.\nBLACK POWDER, FLASH POWDER, IT DOESN'T MATTER.\nEASY TO GET. THE DETONATOR IS EASY TO MAKE.\nTHE CELL TELEPHONE CONNECTION IS EASY.\nTHE ONLY GOOD NEWS ABOUT THESE BOMBS IS THE KILL RADIUS IS SO\nSMALL THAT",

CLINTON\nFIND THAT THE GAP IS CLOSING IN A BIG WAY IN KEY BATTLEGROUND\nSTATES LIKE NEW HAMPSHIRE, THE LATEST POLL SHOWS MRS. CLINTON\nUP BY ONE POINT, DOWN 15 FROM A POLL TAKEN AFTER THE DEMOCRATIC\nCONVENTION IN THE SUMMER. MR. TRUMP PROMISED VOTERS HE\nISN'T WASTING TIME, MAKING SURE HE DEVOTES LOTS OF RESOURCES TO\nBATTLEGROUND STATES. JOINING US ON THE PHONE, SENATOR\nJEFF SESSIONS, CLOSE ADVISER TO DONALD TRUMP ON THE GROUND IN\nNEW HAMPSHIRE WITH MORE ON THE GROUND GAME THERE.\nSENATOR, WELCOME TO THE SHOW. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.\n>> THANK YOU. >> NO DOUBT MOMENTUM HAS\nSHIFTED. MR. TRUMP HAD A COUPLE OF GOOD\nWEEKS WHICH MADE A DIFFERENCE IN THE POLLS NOW.\nWHAT'S THE GROUND GAME NOW IN NEW HAMPSHIRE?\n>> THEY HAVE A GREAT EFFORT. IN FACT, THIS IS THE GREATEST\nGROUND GAME THEY'VE EVER HAD IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, HAVING KNOCKED ON\n50% MORE DOORS AT THIS TIME THAN 2012.\nAND A LOT OF NEW PEOPLE, NOT INVOLVED IN POLITICS BEFORE ARE\nCOMING IN AND VOLUNTEERING. I THINK IT IS SOMETHING SPECIAL\nGOING ON HERE. THAT'S PART OF THE MOMENTUM.\nTHE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW THERE WON'T BE ENOUGH TURNOUT GROUND\nGAME ON ELECTION DAY I DON'T THINK IS ACCURATE IN NEW\nHAMPSHIRE. >> DO YOU THINK THIS IS THE\nRESULT OF A MORE DISCIPLINED CAMPAIGN?\n>> ABSOLUTELY. I DO THINK DONALD TRUMP IS MORE\nDISCIPLINED. HIS SPEECHES ARE FAR MORE\nDETAILED, LAYING OUT A CASE BACKED UP BY FACTS TO JUSTIFY\nHIS POSITION AND I DO THINK PEOPLE ARE RESPONDING WELL TO\nTHAT. HE IS DEMONSTRATING THE KIND OF\nCONFIDENCE PEOPLE WANT. HE'S GOT THE STRENGTH AND THE\nDRIVE AND THE WILL TO BE ABLE TO PUT THIS COUNTRY BACK ON THE\nRIGHT TRACK, BUT I THINK PEOPLE ARE HAVING A GROWING CONFIDENCE\nTHAT HE MASTERS THE ISSUES AND CAN HANDLE THE CHALLENGES OF THE\nPRESIDENCY. >> I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN OUTSPOKEN\nON GETTING BORDER SECURITY UNDER CONTROL AND CRACKING DOWN ON\nILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. I WANT TO GET TO A STORY OF\nACCUSING SECURITY REPORT SAILING WE AREN'T ARRESTING AS MANY\nILLEGALS AS WE ARE LED TO BELIEVE, THAT NUMBERS ARE BEING\nCOVERED UP TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE BORDER AGENTS ARE NABBING AND\nDEPORTING MORE PEOPLE FOR POLITICAL REASONS.\nYOUR REACTION? >> THIS IS THE KIND OF THING\nTHAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS. I CANNOT OVERSTATE HOW\nDISASTROUS HAS BEEN THIS ADMINISTRATION'S POLICY OF\nSIMPLE LAW ENFORCEMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, WE'RE SUPPOSED TO\nTAKE IN ABOUT 4,000 REFUGEES FROM SOUTH AND CENTRAL AMERICA\nAND WE BROUGHT IN 57,000 ILLEGALLY LAST YEAR.\nUNACCOMPANIED MINORS. ONLY 2,000 OF THOSE WERE\nAPPREHENDED. ONLY 2,000 OF THEM WERE\nDEPORTED. PEOPLE ARE JUST COMING IN, BEING\nAPPREHENDED, BEING RELEASED ON BAIL, THEY'RE NOT SHOWING UP FOR\nTHE HEARING, AND IT IS A CATASTROPHE, AND THE AMERICAN\nPEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT IT, AND THIS\nADMINISTRATION SHOULD BE PUNISHED FOR IT POLITICALLY.\nAND HILLARY CLINTON IS TO THE LEFT OF BARACK OBAMA.\nSHE WANTS TO HAVE 65,000 SYRIAN REFUGEES ENTER THE COUNTRY NEXT\nYEAR. THAT'S MORE THAN PRESIDENT\nOBAMA'S INCREASE HE ANNOUNCED A COUPLE DAYS AGO.\nTHIS IS A RADICAL APPROACH TO IMMIGRATION AND THIS ELECTION IS\nPERHAPS THE LAST CHANCE TO FIX IT.\n>> I KNOW THERE ARE CALLS IN CONGRESS TO HAVE THE REPORT\nRELEASED.

SHE EXPOSED A LITTLE GIRL TO A\nINFECTIOUS DISEASE FOR THE SAKE OF A PHOTOGRAPHIC MOMENT.\nTHAT'S SOCIOPATHIC. >> OKAY.\nLET'S TALK ABOUT, DONALD TRUMP IS TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE ON\nTHE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. >> THE LIBERALS AREN'T GIVING\nUP. THEY THINK THIS IS A GOOD\nDEBATE, THIS GETS NATIONAL DEBATE ON SOME OF TRUMP'S\nUNSAVORY SUPPORTERS. WHAT DO YOU THINK?\n>> I THINK THAT'S A MISTAKE. THE REASON THAT DONALD TRUMP IS\nPUSHING THIS SO HARD IS BECAUSE HE UNDERSTAND THAT'S ONE OF\nHILLARY'S MAIN CAMPAIGN THEMES. SHE'S BEEN SAYING I REPRESENT\nTHE UNDERREPRESENTED.

THIS GUY WHO SPENT 70 YEARS ON\nTHIS EARTH SHOWING NO CONCERN FOR WORKING PEOPLE.\nTHIS GUY IS SUDDENLY GOING TO BE YOUR CHAMPION?\n>> THAT WAS PRESIDENT OBAMA IN PHILADELPHIA HAD WEEKEND IN HIS\nFIRST SOLO VEENT BEHALF OF HILLARY CLINTON.\nPART OF THE SURROGATE SURGE. IN HOMES OF SHORING UP THE SWING\nSTATES. THE LATEST QUINNIPIAC POLL SHOWS\nCLINTON'S LEAD OVER TRUMP HAS BEEN CUT IN HALF.\nFROM 10 POINTS IN AUGUST TO 5 POINTS THIS MONTH.\nONE OF SEVERAL BATTLE GROUND STATES WHERE THE POLLS ARE\nTIGHTENING. SHOWING DONALD TRUMP IN THE\nLEAD. JOHN IS A REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST\nAND WAS A SENIOR ADVISER TO FORM HE PENNSYLVANIA SENATOR RICK\nSANTORUM'S PAINFUL YOU WERE SAYING THIS IS POSSIBLE.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK IS BEHIND THIS TRUMP SURGE?\n>> TWO THINGS HAPPENING. HILLARY CLINTON HAS HAD TWO OR\nTHREE REALLY BAD WEEKS. CONTROVERSY WITH THE FOUNDATION.\nWE SAW IT DEMONSTRATED LAST WEEKEND.\nI THINK THE MOVEMENT HAS BEEN BECAUSE OF CHANGES DONALD TRUMP\nHAS MADE. I THINK THAT FRANKLY, I HAVE TO\nGIVE A LOT OF CREDIT TO THE PEOPLE WHO CAME IN AND ARE NOW\nRUNNING HIS CAMPAIGN. THEY SEEM TO COINCIDE.\nHE SEEMS MORE PRESIDENTIAL. THERE IS A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO\nWERE VOTING FOR HILLARY EVEN THOUGH THEY DIDN'T WANT TO\nBECAUSE THEY DIDN'T SEE TRUMP AS A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE.\nFOR THE FIRST TIME THEY'RE SEEING HIM AS AN ALTERNATIVE.\nTHIS MEANS INSTEAD OF DONALD TRUMP HAVING ONE PATH TO\nVICTORY, HE PROBABLY HAS ABOUT THREE DIFFERENT PATHS TO GET ON\n270. >> YOU MEAN IN THE ELECTORAL\nVOTE COUNT. THE FIELD HAS EXPANDED.\nI TALKED TO REPUBLICAN WHO'S SAID WHEN TRUMP WAS HAVING HIS\nBAD PATCH, THE BOTTOM FELL OUT OF HIS SUPPORT IN THE COUNTIES\nTHAT YOU KNOW SO WELL, FOR EXAMPLE, IN PHILADELPHIA.\nAROUND PHILADELPHIA. THAT ARE A REPUBLICAN HAS TO DO\nPRETTY WELL TO WIN THE STATE. THAT HAS COME BACK.\nIS IT BECAUSE HE'S LOOKING MORE PRESIDENTIAL?\nAND HOW IMPORTANT ARE THOSE COUNTIES IF HE IS GOT GO WIN THE\nSTATE? >> WELL, PENNSYLVANIA AS A STATE\nIS A VERY PAROCHIAL STATE BUT NOT A VERY HOME GENIUS STATE.\nYOU HAVE RELATIVELY MODERATE REPUBLICANS IN THE EAST.\nTHAT'S WHERE HIS ACHILLES' HEEL HAS BEEN SO FAR.\nHIS POLICIES, THIS WEEK DID HE A BIG SPEECH ON CHILDCARE.\nPUT OUT HIS INITIATIVE. WHERE DID HE ZMOIT DELAWARE\nCOUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA. WHO IS HE TARGETING?\nOBVIOUSLY IT IS WHITE COLLEGE EDUCATED MODERATE WOMEN IN THAT\nREGION AS WELL AS THE REST OF THE COUNTRY.\nI THINK THEY'RE BEING VERY SMART STRATEGICALLY AS FAR AS\nINITIATIVES. BUT ALSO HIS TONE OR TENOR HAS\nCHANGED AND I THINK THAT IS VERY HELPFUL AND PART OF THE REASON\nFOR THE MOVEMENT. >> ALL RIGHT.\nHE IS STILL TRAILING IN PENNSYLVANIA IN THE LATEST POLL\nBY FIVE. HE HAS ALREADY CAUGHT UP IN OHIO\nAND IN FLORIDA. PENNSYLVANIA IS A MORE\nDEMOCRATIC STATE AT THE PRESIDENTIAL LEVEL THAN EITHER\nOF THOSE TWO. WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT.\n>>? ABSOLUTELY.\nLET'S PUT IN IT PERSPECTIVE. A REPUBLICAN HASN'T WON FOR\nPRESIDENT THIS PENNSYLVANIA SINCE 1988.\nSO IT IS AN UP-HILL BATTLE. HE IS ALSO GETTING ENNEWS IN\nPLACES LIKE MICHIGAN, COLORADO, IOWA, NEVADA.\nEVEN IF HE DOESN'T WIN PENNSYLVANIA FOR THE FIRST TIME,\nIT THERE ARE OTHER VIABLE OPTIONS AND PATHS TO GET TO 270.\n>> WHAT DO YOU THINK TRUMP OUGHT TO FOCUS FROM HERE UNTIL THE END\nOF THE ELECTION IF HE WANTS TO PICK UP THESE SWING STATES MANY\nMARCHLY I'M THINKING MICHIGAN AND PENNSYLVANIA.\nEVEN IF HE PICKS UP IOWA, ROMNEY IN ARIZONA, HE HAS TO PICK UP\nONE OF THOSE TWO. MY BELIEF IS THAT THIS IS NOT\nABOUT HILLARY CLINTON ANYMORE. HER NUMBERS ARE BAKED INTO THE\nCAKE AS WE SAY. PEOPLE HAVE KNOWN HER FOR 24\nYEARS. WHATEVER YOU THINK OF HER, YOU\nDO. WHAT HE HAS TO DO TO CHOSE THE\nSALE IS HAVE PEOPLE HAVE SOME CONFIDENCE IN HIM ON A PERSONAL\nLEVEL. FOR EXAMPLE, I THINK HE SHOULD\nBE FEATURED IN ALL HIS ADS. INSTEAD OF BEING KRIFK HILLARY\nCLINTON, I THINK PEOPLE WANT TO GET TO KNOW AND TRUST HIM.\nTHERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE AN UNFAVORABLE OPINION OF\nHILLARY CLINTON OTHER ARE YET TO BE VOTING FOR TRUMP.\n>> SO THEY WANT TO KNOW THAT DONALD TRUMP IS SOMEONE THEY\nCOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH IN THE OVAL OFFICE.\nTHEY KNOW IT IS A RISK BECAUSE HE IS AN UNKNOWN.\nTHEY WANT TO SEE, OKAY, I CAN GET MY HEAD AROUND LISTENING TO\nTHAT GUY IN THE OVAL OFFICE AND THINK HE WILL BE COMPETENT IN\nTHE JOB. THAT KIND OF FUNDAMENTAL COMFORT\nLEVEL YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. >> I CALL AT THIS TIME COCKTAIL\nPARTY TEST. THEY WANT TO GO TO THE\nNEIGHBORHOOD PARTY OR THE COUNTRY CLUB AND SAY YES, I\nDECIDED I'M VOTING FOR DONALD TRUMP AND NOT GET BAD LOOKS.\n>> MAYBE THEY WON'T ADMIT THAT THEY'LL VOTE FOR HIM.\nTHERE IS THAT PHENOMENON OUT THERE.\n>> I THINK THAT'S TRUE. IN PENNSYLVANIA, DONALD TRUMP\nWON 67 OF ALL THE COUNTIES IN THE PRIMARY.\nTHAT USUALLY DOESN'T HAPPEN. >> WHAT I'M HEARING YOU SAY IS\nHE HAS TO SPEAK TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ON A STAGE AND SOUND LIKE\nHE CAN HOLD HIS OWN. >> I THINK IF HE ACTS LIKE A\nPROSECUTOR THERE TO SKEWER HER. I THINK IF HE CAN BE CRITICAL\nBUT IN A WAY PEOPLE DON'T FIND OFFENSIVE, I THINK THAT'S\nBENEFICIAL TO HIM. >> WHEN WE COME BACK, THE BATTLE\nFOR THE SENATE HEATING UP.

IT IS SIGNIFICANT IN THAT HE IS\nONE OF THE TOP FIVE IN THE ISIS LEADERSHIP.\nIT IS ALSO SIGNIFICANT IN THAT IT SHOWS WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING\nTO TARGET ISIS'S MULTI MEDIA GLOBAL OUTREACH.\nJUST LAST MONTH WE TOOK OUT AL AL ADNANI.\nTO THE TO THE TOP GUYS RESPONSE FOR ISIS PROPAGANDA AROUND THE\nWORLD HAVE BEEN TAIRN TAKEN OUT IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS.\nSIGNIFICANT. >> WHAT'S THE NEXT PLAN OF\nACTION? 1K3W4RD WHAT'S GOING HAPPEN\nFLEXION WE ALL HOPE IS THIS BRINGS US CLOSER TO ISIS'S SELF\nDECLARED AMIR AL-BAGHDADI. THE HIGHER YOU WORK UP THE CHAIN\nOF COMMAND, THE MORE INTEL T CLOSE YOU ARE WE'RE GETTING TO\nAL-BAGHDADI. I THINK A DAY IS GOING TO COME\nWHEN A COALITION PUTS A HELD FIRE MISSILE ON TOP OF\nAL-BAGHDADI AND WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THAT AGAIN.\n>> OSAMA BIN LADEN THEY HAD TO KALE LOT OF THE TORUSES BEFORE\nTHEY COULD GET TO HIM. HOW MUCH CLOSER DO YOU BELIEVE\nWE ARE AT GETTING TO ISIS'S LITER AL-BAGHDADI BEING THE\nPRIME TARGET HERE AND HOW MUCH LONGER DO YOU THINK IT WILL TAKE\nFOR THEM TO FIND THIS GUY AND CAN HIM?\n>> I HOPE NOT MUCH LONGER. HE HAS TO KNOW.\nTHEY ALL KNOW THAT THE TECHNOLOGY OF THE COALITION AND\nSPECIFICALLY U.S. UNMANNED PLATFORMS ARE REALLY WATCHING\nFOR THESE GUYS. I I THINK IT COULD BE A MATTER\nOF WEEKS OR MONTHS. I WOULD LIKE IT TO BE SOONER BUT\nTHIS IS A HIERARCHAL ORGANIZATION.\nTHEY WILL PROMOTE FROM WITHIN. SO WHOEVER WE KILL THEY ARE\nGOING TO REPLACE BUT THE REAL THE FIGURE HEADS ARE THE ONES\nTHAT WE'RE REMOVING NOW. THE RIDGING FOUNDING FATHERS IT\nIS REALLY IMPORTANT TO TAKE THESE GUYS OUT.\n>> LET'S TALK MORE ABOUT OUR CAMPAIGN IN SYRIA AT THIS POINT\nWE CAN'T WITH THE AIR STRIKES. WITH HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT IS\nGOING TAKING OFFICE HAS A HUGE BURDEN NOW TO DECIDE WHAT DO IN\nIN SYRIA. WE'VE MADE SO MUCH GROUND THERE.\nBUT WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY SEND BOOTS ON THE GROUND SO TO SPEAK\nINTO SYRIA. BUT BUT WE NEED TO KEEP THE\nMOMENT GOING. WE CAN'T HAVE A PRESIDENT COME\nIN AND SLOW THINGS DOWN BECAUSE IT COULD TAKE BACK ALL THE\nSUFFICE OUR MILITARY MEN AND WOMEN HAVE MADE.\nWHAT DOES THE NEXT PRESIDENT NEED DO AS SOON AS THEY TAKE\nOFFICE? ?\nTHE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE THE SPECIAL FORCES\nON THE GROUND. WEAR GOING TO SEW MORE TROOPS\nGOING INTO IRAQ TO ADVISE AND ASSIST IRAQI FORCES.\nI'D ALSO LIKE TO SEE ARAB PARTNERS MOVING IN TO TAKE SLACK\nUP FRO THIS EM. YOU HAVE TO HAVE TROOPS ON THE\nGROUND. BETTER IF IT'S FROM REGIONAL\nPARTNERS. BUT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY ARMY\nEXPERIENCE FORCES ARE WITH THEM THEM.\n>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WII APPRECIATE IT.\n>> THANKS.",

THEY SAY THEY THINK HE WAS THE\nISLAMIC STATE'S NUMBER THREE GUY, A TERRORIST KNOWN AS DR.\nWALEEL. HE PRODUCED SOME OF THOSE\nGRUESOME EXECUTION VIDEOS. LET'S BRING IN RICK RUNELL.\nRETIRED ARMY MAJOR GENERAL BOB SCALES ALSO A FOX NEWS MILITARY\nANALYST AND AUTHOR OF THE BOOK SCALES ON WAR.\nGOOD TO HAVE BOTH OF YOU HERE ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC AND RICK, I\nWANT TO START WITH YOU, HORRENDOUS, ISIS PROPAGANDA HAS\nBEEN WELL PRODUCED AND QUITE EFFECTIVE.\nHOW BIG A DEAL IS THIS? >> THIS IS A GREAT HIT.\nIT'S SOMETHING THAT'S NEEDED. MY CONCERN IS THAT IT'S TAKING\nTOO LONG. WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND THE\nCOMMAND AND CONTROL CENTER FOR ISIS, ISIS CONTINUES TO BE\nSTRONG. AND NOW WHAT WE HAVE IS U.S.\nALLIES, THE KURDS AND THE TURKS FIGHTING EACH OTHER.\nASSAD IS BEGINNING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS, YET, THE\nPOLICY IS ASSAD SHOULD GO, THE RUSSIANS ARE THERE PROPPING UP\nASSAD. OUR POLICY IS A MESS, AND I'M\nHOPING WE CAN HAVE THE NEXT PRESIDENT CHANGE THE RULES OF\nENGAGEMENT SO WE CAN HAVE MORE BOOTS ON THE GROUND TO GET\nTIMELY AND ACCURATE INTELLIGENCE TO BE ABLE TO GO AFTER THE\nCOMMAND AND CONTROL CENTER FOR ISIS AND DEFEAT IT IMMEDIATELY.\n>> I WANT TO GET YOU INTO THE CONVERSATION, GENERAL.\nWHAT'S THE IMPACT FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE DO WE KNOW IF\nTHERE'S ANOTHER PERSON READY TO TAKE HIS PLACE?\n>> HE WAS THE WALTER CRONKITE OF ISIS, HE WAS A BIG DEAL, THE\nCHIEF PROPAGANDA FOR ISIS, AND WHAT HIS ASSASSINATION MEANS IS\nA COUPLE THINGS. FIRST OF ALL, WHAT'S BEEN\nMISSING IN THE NEWS IN THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS, ON THE MARCH TO\nMOOS YOU WILL, THE COALITION HAS VACUUMED UP TENS OF THOUSANDS OF\nDIGITAL DOCUMENTS ON PC'S AND THUMB DRIVES AND DISKS THAT HAVE\nOPENED UP THE SECRETS OF ISIS ENORMOUSLY.\nSECONDLY AS YOU JUST SAW A COUPLE DAYS AGO, A LOT OF THE\nRANK AND FILE OF ISIS, PARTICULARLY THOSE IN THE INNER\nCIRCLE ARE GETTING DISENCHANTED WITH THEIR LEADERSHIP AND\nSTARTING TO TURN ON THEM. THE THIRD THING IS THAT THE\nQUALITY OF SIGNALS INTELLIGENCE THAT'S BEING SCOOPED UP BY THE\nCOALITION HAS GOTTEN ENORMOUSLY BETTER OVER THE LAST COUPLE\nYEARS. A LONG WAY FROM THE DARK DAYS OF\n2014 WHEN ISIS WAS ESSENTIALLY AN INTELLIGENCE BLACK HOLE.\nRICK IS RIGHT, A LONG WAY TO GO. QUITE FRANKLY, I THINK THIS IS\nPROGRESS. >> LET ME STAY WITH YOU FOR A\nLITTLE MORE. DO WE KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS GUY'S\nROLE IN ISIS, WHAT HIS ROLE WAS, HE APPARENTLY IS ONE OF THE FEW\nISIS LEADERS WHO WOULD MEET REGULARLY WITH THE HEAD OF ISIS,\nal BAGHDADI. HE WAS A PROMINENT MEMBER OF HIS\nSENIOR COUNCIL, WHICH IS ISIS LEADERSHIP GROUP, THIS GUY'S A\nKEY PLAYER, HE WAS. >> HE'S A BIG DEAL.\nHE'S KIND OF LIKE A MEDIA ROCK STAR.\nHE WAS NOT ONLY THE WALTER CRONKITE, BUT THE MONTH DEUCER\nAND DIRECTOR OF THESE HORRIFIC VIDEOS OF KILLINGS BY ISIS, THE\nFACT THAT HE'S NO LONGER A PLAYER DOESN'T MEAN THAT SOMEONE\nWON'T STEP UP INTO HIS PLACE. THERE'S A PRETTY DEEP BENCH.\nWHAT IT DOES SAY TO THE RANK AND FILE, THEY'RE STARTING TO SEE\nTHE BIG NAMES, THE ROCK STARS BEGIN TO DISAPPEAR FROM THE\nSCENE. AND THAT HAS TO HAVE A\nPSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECT ON THOSE THAT ARE KEEPING UP THE FIGHT.\nRICK IS RIGHT HERE, RICK IS RIGHT.\nWE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE WE ABSOLUTELY START TO COLLAPSE\nTHE CENTER OF GRAVITY. >> I WANT TO LET RICK CLOSE OUT\nTHE SEGMENT. THEY KEEP COMING, EVERY TIME YOU\nGET RID OF ONE, HERE COMES ANOTHER.\nWHAT'S THE LIKELY FALLOUT OF THIS, WOULD WE SEE LESS ISIS PROPAGANDA?\nOR PERHAPS AN ADVERSE EFFECT WITH POTENTIAL ISIS FOLLOWERS\nEVEN MORE INSPIRED, AND DETERMINED TO PUT OUT MORE\nPROPAGANDA. >> I'M NOT AS HOPEFUL, BECAUSE\nTHIS GUY'S GOING TO BE REPLACED, I MEAN, THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT\nTHERE'S A WHOLE TEAM OF PEOPLE BEHIND HIM, THEY WILL RISE UP,\nTHEY WILL FEEL LIBERATED TO DO THEIR OWN THING.\nWE HAVE A MAJOR PROBLEM IN THAT WE'VE TAKEN OUT SOME SENIOR\nPEOPLE OF ISIS. AND YET THERE ARE OTHERS THAT\nARE COMING RIGHT BEHIND THEM. AS YOU POINT OUT, THE LONE WOLF\nPROBLEM ALONE, WHEN SOMEONE IS RADICALIZED HERE IN THE U.S. OR\nIN EUROPE, ALL ON THEIR OWN THAT IS NOT A GOOD SIGN, THAT'S A\nSUCCESSFUL SIGN THAT ISIS IS BEGINNING TO TAKE THEIR\nPROPAGANDA AND MAKE IT EASY FOR PEOPLE TO BE RADICALIZED OR BE\nRECRUITED ON THEIR OWN THROUGH READING THE MATERIAL.\nTHAT MEANS ISIS IS BEING SUCCESSFUL WHEN WE HAVE A LONE\nWOLF BEING RADICALIZED SO QUICKLY.\nI'M NOT AS HOPEFUL UNTIL WE CAN GO IN AND REALLY JUST KILL THIS\nOPERATION ONCE AND FOR ALL. IT SHOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN THIS\nLONG, THAT'S THE FRUSTRATION. WHEN WE HAVE 63 MEMBERS OF THE\nCOALITION, AND THE U.S. IS LEADING THIS, WE SHOULD BE ABLE\nTO GET NATO AND THE OTHER 62 MEMBERS OF THIS COALITION AND BE\nABLE TO CRUSH THEM VERY FAST AND WE'RE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT.\n>> I AGREE WITH THAT. >> VERY GOOD, THE GENERAL GOT\nTHE LAST WORD AS IT WAS.

HE DOESN'T DO IT BY MEMORIZING\nDOWN PLATES, BUT HE DOES IT BY FORMLATING GREAT PLANS.\nYOU WANT TO LOOK AT WHAT'S UNFIT.\nUNFIT IS CALLING HALF OF ALL HARD-WORKING AMERICANS THAT.\nUNSTABILIZING IN IRAQ, EGYPT, EVERY OTHER MIDDLE EASTERN\nCOUNTRY. UNFIT IS ALLOWING OUR SERVICEMEN\nTO DIE ON A ROOF IN BENGHAZI BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THEY WANT TO\nKEEP COVER FOR THEMSELVES AND THEY WANTED TO LIE TO THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE AND QUITE FRANKLY, THEY DIDN'T TO WANT\nMAKE A TOUGH CALL. UNFIT IS LEAD DELETING 15,000\nE-MAILS AND LYING TO CONGRESS AND LYING TO THE FBI AND\nEVERYBODY ELSE. UNFIT IS RUNNING ONE OF THE\nLARGEST PONZI SCHEMES IN AMERICAN CHARITABLE HISTORY.\nAND YOU KNOW, I THINK HER RECORD IS A TOXIC RECORD.\nAND I THINK EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THAT.\nAND I THINK MY FATHER WILL BE SPENDING A LOT OF TIME TALKING\nABOUT THAT. >> OKAY.\nAND VERY QUICKLY. GHAICHB YOUR FATHER IS ALL OVER\nTHE PLACE, I MEAN, HE GOES FROM ONE STATE, ONE EVENT TO ANOTHER,\nAND SHE'S VERY QUIET AND KIND OF BEHIND THE SCENES, YOUR FATHER\nIS PREPARED, IS HE DOING DEBATE PRACTICE, ERIC?\n>> ABSOLUTELY. ABSOLUTELY.\nAND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT HE REALIZES IT'D BE VERY IMPORTANT,\nBUT HE DOES IT HIS WAY. AGAIN NOT MEMORIZING TWO CARDS,\nHE DOES IT BY TALKING TO GREAT PEOPLE AND SURROUNDING HIMSELF\nBY GREAT PEOPLE AND HE'LL CERTAINLY BE READY AND HE'S DONE\nA PHENOMENAL JOB AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT HE'S GOING TO DO\nAMAZING COME NEXT MONDAY. >> WE ALL LOOK FORWARD TO IT.\nERIC TRUMP, THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH US THIS EVENING.\n>> TAKE CARE, JUDGE. >> WITH ME NOW, MY POLITICAL\nPANELIST, MARY-ANN MARSH, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST AND\nCHAIRMAN MATT. GOOD EVENING, IT IS, AS I'M SURE\nYOU BOTH SAID, MARY-ANN, YOU CERTAINLY HAVEN'T FROM THE\nBEGINNING, IT IS A HORSE RACE. IT IS NECK AND NECK.\nTHE DEBATE IS JUST OVER ONE WEEK AWAY.\nAND THAT RIGHT NOW BOTH OF THEM PREPARING FOR THE DEBATE. MARY-ANN, HOW DOES SHE GET UNDER\nHIS SKIN? MATT, IS HE IN HER HEAD?\nI'LL START WITH YOU. >> INCH FIRST OF ALL, WE'VE\nNEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. NEVER HAD A WOMAN BY THE NOMINEE\nFOR ANY PARTY FOR PRESIDENT, NEVER SEEN THE LIKES OF DONALD\nTRUMP, AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME EVERY VOTER IN AMERICA AND\nMANY PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD ARE GOING TO SEE THEM ON A STAGE,\nSIDE BY SIDE, TAKE THEIR FULL MEASURE.\nI THINK THE CHALLENGE FOR SHINT, SHE'S A VERY GOOD DEBATER, BUT\nDONALD TRUMP'S A GREAT PERFORMER.\nAND WE'VE SEEN THAT THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN AND CERTAINLY IN\nTHE REPUBLICAN DEBATE US. I THINK FOR HIM, SHE'S GOT TO\nGET UNDER HIM AND ASK HIM QUESTIONS ON POLICY.\nI MEAN, REALLY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS.\nAND HE CAN'T JUST BLOW THEM OFF BY SAYING, BELIEVE ME.\nBIG TIME. GOING TO DO IT.\nTRUST ME. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO WANT HEAR\nMORE THAN THAT. >> AND I THINK THAT SOME OF THE\nSPEECHES OF LATE ARE PART OF THE REASON THAT HIS NUMBERS HAVE\nGONE UP AND WE JUST SAW THE FOX NEWS POLL, HE'S UP ONE.\nMATT, HOW DOES HE GET INTO HER HEAD?\n>> WELL, SHE DOESN'T SEEM TO LIKE HIM VERY MUCH.\nAND I THINK THAT'S GOING -- I THINKEST THAT GOING TO PLAY TO\nHIS ADVANTAGE. I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS BOTH\nOF THESE CANDIDATES HAVE ARE OBVIOUSLY HIGH NECKTIVES AND\nHILLARY CLINTON IS NOT EXACTLY A WARM AND CUDDLY FIGURE.\nAND I THINK SHE HAS TO SOMEHOW COME ACROSS TO THE AMERICAN\nVOTER OUT THERE THAT SHE'S NOT THIS KIND OF COLD, HEARTLESS,\n25-YEAR GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRAT WHO'S GOTTEN RICH WHILE SHE'S\nSERVED. AND I THINK SHE HAS TO COME\nACROSS AS SOMEONE WHO IS EMPATHIC AND PEOPLE WHO KNOW ME\nTELL ME SHE'S LIKABLE. AND I THINK SHE'S GOT TO BE ABLE\nTO DO THAT IN ORDER TO PUT THIS RACE AWAY.\nAND I DON'T THINK SHE CAN. >> BUT HE ALSO HAS A DIFFICULT\nPOSITION, BEING A MAN. COMPETING WITH A WOMAN.\nMATT. >> YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.\nGEORGE H.B. BUSH FACED WITH THIS WITH JERRY, AND AT IN SEVERAL\nPOINTS BACK, YOU KNOW, SHE CHASTISED HIM SEVERAL TIMES FOR,\nYOU KNOW, TALKING DOWN TO HER AND PATRONIZING HER.\nSHE USED THAT WORD. THAT'S A CARD THAT A WOMAN CAN\nPLAY. VERY DEAFLY, AND I EXPECT\nHILLARY CLINTON TO TRY TO DO THE VERY SAME THING.\n>> AND MICHELLE, I MEAN, HOW DO YOU EXPECT HILLARY TO HANDLE\nTHAT? I MEAN, I AM SURE DONALD\nUNDERSTANDS THE PARAMETERS AS IT RELATES TO HER GIVEN THE LAZIO\nFROM YEARS AGO, THAT MESS-UP. >> WELL LOOK, I THINK AS MUCH AS\nDONALD TRUMP HAS A FINE LINE TO WALK WITH HILLARY CLINTON, IF\nHE'S DISMISSIVE OF HER AND GIVES HER THE HEISMAN, HILLARY CLINTON\nON THE OTHER HAND HAS TO PICK AND CHOOSE HER SPOTS.\nVOTERS WANT EVERYONE WHO'S GOING TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE DWRIETS\nSTAND UP FOR THEMSELVES BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T SEE YOU DEFEND\nYOURSELF. THEN THEY THINK YOU'RE NOT GOING\nTO DEFEND ME. AND I THINK FOR HILLARY CLINTON\nAS A WOMAN, THAT'S A FINE LINE TO WALK AS WELL.\nTHAT'S WHY THIS WHOLE DEBATE, WE CAN ALL TRY TO PREDICT WHAT IT'S\nGOING TO BE LIKE. NONE OF US NOW BECAUSE WE'VE\nNEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE.\nAND THAT'S REALLY THE -- HAS TO BE THE EXCITING AND ALSO THE\nUNNERVING THING FOR BOTH OF THESE CAMPAIGNS.\n>> OH YES. THAT FIRST DEBATE WILL BE HUGE.\nMARY-ANN MARCH ISSUE, MATT, THANKS FOR BEING WITH US THIS\nEVENING. >> THANKS JUDGE.\n>> ALL RIGHT. AND NEXT, THE CASE AGAINST\nHILLARY CLINTON IS VERY MUCH ALIVE.\nCONGRESSMAN JASON CHAFFETZ, CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE OVERSIGHT\nCOMMITTEE SITS DWOUN ME TO TALK ABOUT WHO HE SUBPOENAED TO\nTESTIFY THIS WEEK. AND WHY THE E-MAIL CASE COULD\nSTILL CAUSE SOME BIG HAVOCS FOR",

THIS WAS LIKE A -- AND IT WAS A\nBIG EXPLOSION. LIKE I HEAR, IF I'M WATCHING A\nNEWS SHOW AND THERE'S -- IT SEEMED LIKE A WAR TO ME.\nIT REALLY SOUNDED HORRIBLE. IT WAS REALLY SCARY.\n>> AND YOU SAW BLACK SMOKE. YOU CAME OUT OF THE CONVENIENCE\nSTORE HERE ON THE CORNER OF 23rd AND 7th.\nYOU SAW THE SMOKE DOWN TOWARDS 6th AVENUE AND 23rd.\n>> BUT I SAW IT VERY CLEARLY, IT WAS LIKE A BIG CLOUD OF BLACK\nSMOKE. >> AND BASED ON WHAT YOU SAW,\nYOU DID NOT SEE THIS EXPLOSION COME OUT OF A BUILDING.\nFROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE, IT WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET.\n>> IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE THERE WAS A BUILDING.\nIT JUST SEEMED LIKE -- IT WAS JUST LIKE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE\nSTREET, THAT'S WHAT IT SEEMED LIKE TO ME.\n>> TERMS OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE HERE, WAS IT A PACKED A NIGHT ON\nA SATURDAY NIGHT THAT YOU WOULD SEE IN CHELSEA OR ANY GIVEN\nNIGHT? >> IT WAS PRETTY CROWDED IN THE\nSTREETS TONIGHT, A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT.\nI HAD COME FROM DOWNTOWN. BUT THE PEOPLE THAT STARTED\nRUNNING UP 23rd, THAT'S WHY I RAN.\nI WAS LOOKING TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON, TO STAY THERE, AFTER\nTHE EXPLOSION. AND I GOT SCARED, BECAUSE\nEVERYBODY STARTED RUNNING, YOU KNOW?\nAND PEOPLE WERE PANICKING. AND PEOPLE CAME OUT FROM 24th\nSTREET FROM THEIR APARTMENTS AND THEY'RE ALL ASKING, DO YOU KNOW\nWHAT WENT ON? DO YOU KNOW WHAT WENT ON?\nAND THERE WERE PEOPLE AT THEIR JOBS AND THEY SAID THEIR WHOLE\nBUILDING SHOOK. SO THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.\n>> THE EXPLOSION WAS SO LOUD THAT WE ACTUALLY HAD SOMEBODY\nTHAT CAME UP TO US THAT PUT -- THAT IS ACTUALLY WITH THE\nNATIONAL GUARD. THEY WERE INSIDE THEIR APARTMENT\nBUILDING ON 24th STREET AND THEY TOLD ME, ONCE THEY HEARD THE\nEXPLOSION, THEY PUT ON THE UNIFORM AND CAME OUT HERE ON\nTHEIR OWN ACCORD TO TELL ME HOW THEY COULD HELP.\nTHE EXPLOSION WAS SO LOUD, HE INITIALLY THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS\nIT WAS SCAFFOLDING, BUT THEN HE REALIZED IT WAS MUCH LOUDER THAN\nTHAT. AND THAT'S WHAT YOU SEE WITH\nSOME OF THOSE NATIONAL GUARD UNIFORM WEARERS HERE.\nIT SEEMS TO ME, BASED ON WHAT THIS PERSON TOLD ME, THAT THEY\nJUST HAPPEN TO BE IN THE AREA FOR TRAINING, AND AS SOON AS\nTHEY HEARD, THEY HAPPENED TO BE IN YUMP ALREADY.\nSOME OF THE PEOPLE YOU MAY BE SEEING IN THE BACKGROUND AND\nDECIDED TO COME OUT HERE. IT'S NOT LIKE THEY WERE CALLED\nOUT HERE. THEY WERE HAPPY TO BE IN THE\nAREA FOR BUT AGAIN, 25 INJURED, 2\nCIVILIANS ON THE STREET. YOU HEARD THAT ACCOUNT.\nSHE WAS IN A CONVENIENCE STORE, LOUD ENOUGH THAT LAST, SHE HAD\nTOLD ME, THE SOUND IT SEEMED LIKE FOR 15 SECONDS.\nAGAIN, BUT WE HAVE NO INDICATION OF WHERE THIS CAME FROM, WHAT IS\nGOING ON YET. WE STILL DO NOT KNOW, BUT GIVEN\nWHAT HAPPENED EARLIER TODAY, WITH THE SEASIDE PARK PIPE BOMB\nTHAT WAS FOUND IN THAT GARBAGE CAN, OBVIOUSLY, ALERT WAS\nALREADY HIGH IN THE AREA. THE JOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCE\nWAS IN THAT AREA ALREADY. SO WE'LL SEE.\nWE'RE WAITING ON AS MUCH INFORMATION AS WE CAN.\nTRAFFIC HAS BEEN STOPPED. PEOPLE ARE ON THE STREETS\nWATCHING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CHELSEA NEIGHBORHOOD HERE, WHERE\nABOUT 20 BLOCKS SOUTH OF TIMES SQUARE.\nWE'RE ABOUT NINE, TEN BLOCKS AWAY FROM PENN STATION.\nA MAJOR TRANSPORTATION HUB AREA HERE.\nTHIS IS A BEAUTIFUL SATURDAY NIGHT.\nBUT RIGHT NOW, THE CREWS HERE ARE JUST -- LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE\nON STANDBY. BUT AGAIN, AN EXPLOSION ON 23rd\nAND 6th, 25 INJURED. WE'LL BRING YOU MORE ADDS WE GET\nIT. >> LET ME MAKE ONE MORE POINT.\nUSUALLY SENSITIVE SIGHTS SUCH AS THE UNITED NATIONS, THE EMPIRE\nSTATE BUILDING, THE WORLD TRADE CENTER.\nTHE RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS WENT AFTER THE WORLD TRADE\nCENTER TWICE. AND FIRST TERRORIST ATTACK IN\nTHE UNITED STATES OCCURRED IN 1990, AN ASSASSINATION OF AN\nEXTREMIST RABBI WHO WAS SHOT BY SOMEONE WHO TURNED O OUT TO BE\nPART OF THE CELL THAT THEN WENT ON TO BOMB THE WORLD TRADE\nCENTER THREE YEARS LATER. WE OF COURSE AT THIS EARLY POINT\nHAVE NO INDICATION OF ANY OF THAT.\nI RAISE THIS, BECAUSE ARE THERE ANY SENSE TY SIGHTS THERE ON\n23rd AND 6th? I KNOW THE AREA.\nTHERE IS A NATIONAL GUARD ARMORY ON 14th STREET BETWEEN 7th OR\n8th AVENUE, BUT YOU'RE DEALING WITH A BASIC NEW YORK CITY,\nCHELSEA COMMERCIAL STREET WITH RESTAURANTS AND COFFEE SHOPS AND\nTHE FAMED CHELSEA HOTEL. SO AM I RIGHT, THERE ISN'T\nREALLY ANYTHING THAT WOULD SPEAK OUT TO ANY KIND OF TERRORIST\nATTACK, EXCEPT THE TYPE OF FEAR AND TERROR THAT THEY WOULD\nPOTENTIALLY WANT TO WAGE BY PUTTING A POTENTIAL BOMB IN A\nGARBAGE CAN, ALTHOUGH I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR, THERE IS NO\nINDICATION THAT THAT CONFIRMED IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED HERE\nTONIGHT. >> Reporter: RIGHT, ERIC.\nI DON'T SEE ANYTHING HERE IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA THAT WOULD BE A\nPOTENTIAL TARGET LIKE YOU MENTIONED, LIKE A MAJOR\nTRANSPORTATION HUB. I KNOW YOU MENTIONED THE ARMORY.\nWE SEE A WHOLE FOODS MARKET PLACE.\nTHIS IS A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD.\nPEOPLE LIVE HERE. THERE ARE OTHER BARS HERE IN THE\nAREA, BUT AGAIN, A LOT OF PEOPLE LIVE IN THIS AREA.\nI WOULDN'T SAY THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING THAT WOULD POP UP.\nBUT WE ARE GOING TO TRY TO MOVE TO THE ORE SIDE OF 6th AND 5th.\nIT SEEMS TO BE A FLUID SITUATION, TRAFFIC HAS STOPPED.\nAND WE'LL TRY TO GET YOU MORE INFORMATION AS THE TO PERHAPS\nLOCATION. WE ONLY KNOW IT WAS ON 23rd AND\n6th. I DON'T KNOW IN FRONT OF WHAT\nBUILDING. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S ON AN\nINTERSECTION. FRANKLY, WE ONLY KNOW THAT THERE\nWAS A VERY LOUD SOUND AT THIS POINT.\nWE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS FROM. WE JUST HAVE WITNESSES WHO HAVE\nBEEN GIVING US AN AMAZING ACCOUNT THUS FAR.\nAND WE'LL SEE. WE'LL TALK TO OTHER WITNESSES,\nAS WELL. AS A MATTER OF FACT, WE MAY HAVE\nONE OVER HERE, TOO, THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO BRING IN.\nTHAT'S THE BEST WE CAN DO. WE'LL BRING HER HERE, ANYWAY.\nYOU'RE RIGHT, ERIC, GO AHEAD. >> I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY, LET\nME BRING THE VIEWERS UP TO DATE ON THE HISTORY OF THE BOMBINGS\nIN NEW YORK CITY. IN 1973, A PALESTINIAN GROUP,\nTHE BLACK SEPTEMBER GROUP ACTUALLY LEFT TWO CAR BOMBS, ONE\nON FIFTH AVENUE, ONE BY JFK. THANKFULLY, THEY DID NOT\nDETONATE. THERE WAS A SHOOTER AT THE\nEMPIRE STATE BUILDING. MUCH MORE RECENTLY, BACK IN THE\nEARLY 1990s, WE'VE HAD SHOOTINGS.\nRASHI BAZ, WHO TURNED OUT TO BE A TERRORIST, KILLING ARY HABBER\nSTAN. BUT NOTHING LIKE THE SPATE OF\nBOMBINGS THE CITY SAW AT THE LaGUARDIA AIRPORT WHEN A BOMB\nWAS PUT IN A BAGGAGE CONTAINER AT THE AIRPORT AND KILLED 11\nPEOPLE. THANKFULLY, WE HAVE NOT HAD OF\nCOURSE A TOWN HOUSE AT GREENWICH VILLAGE EXPLODED ACCIDENTAL\nBECAUSE OF THE WEATHER UNDERGROUND AND RADICALS AT THAT\nPOINT WERE TRYING TO ESTABLISH A BOMB FACTORY IN GREENWICH\nVILLAGE. BUT CLEARLY, NO INDICATIONS OF\nTHAT SORT HERE, SO FAR. YOU HAVE A WITNESS.\nLET'S HEAR WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY. >> Reporter: DEBORA, YOU WERE IN\nTHE AREA WHEN THE BLAST WENT OFF.\nIS THAT CORRECT? >> YES, I WAS.\n>> WHERE WERE YOU? >> I WAS IN A BURRITO PLACE, A\nVEGETARIAN PLACE. AND THE LADY WAS FIXING MY\nBURRITO AND I GET READY TO SIT DOWN TO EAT AND ALL OF A SUDDEN\nWE HEAR A BOOM! AND IT WAS LOUD AND SHOOK THE\nBUILDING AND EVERYTHING. AND THEN, BAM, WE RAN.\nWE HOLD PEOPLE RUNNING, HOLDING THEIR EARS, COUGHING AND WIPING\nTHEIR EYES AND STUFF LIKE THAT. AND ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?\nARE YOU ALL RIGHT? AND WHILE WE WAS DOING THAT, WE\nSAW A BIG CLOUD OF SMOKE. IT WAS A FIREBALL IN BETWEEN.\nTHAT'S HOW WE SAW IT. WHEN THE FIRE WAS GOING ON --\nNOT THE FIRE, BECAUSE WE DIDN'T SEE FIRE.\nYOU SAW LIKE A MOON, BUT IT WAS RAIN AND SAW A CLOUD AROUND IT.\nAND EVERYBODY WAS RUNNING AND RUNNING AND RUNNING.\nAND WE WAS JUST RUNNING. WE WERE ASKING PEOPLE, ARE YOU\nALL RIGHT? I DIDN'T WANT TO GO OVER THERE.\nBUT IT WAS BAD. REAL BAD.\nWE THOUGHT IT WAS A BUILDING COLLAPSING, OR I THOUGHT,\nBECAUSE I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT BOMBS OR ANYTHING LIKE\nTHAT. I THOUGHT IT WAS A GAS\nEXPLOSION, BECAUSE I KNOW THEY WORKING ON THAT BUILDING OVER\nTHERE. BUT COME TO FIND OUT, IT WAS\nSOMETHING DIFFERENT. >> SO THEY ARE WORKING ON A\nBUILDING OVER THERE BY 23rd? >> YES.\nTHEY ARE. THEY HAVE THE SCAFFOLDING AND\nEVERYTHING UP. SO I THOUGHT IT WAS THAT.\n>> Reporter: WAS THE EXPLOSION BY THAT BUILDING?\n>> IT WAS NEAR THE BUILDING, AS FAR AS I CAN SEE.\n>> Reporter: IN FRONT OF IT? >> YES, AROUND IN THAT AREA.\nI DIDN'T GO ALL THE WAY DOWN. BUT IT WAS BIG ENOUGH FOR ME TO\nSEE IT. I MEAN, IT WAS BIG, IT WAS REAL\nBIG. >> YOU WERE AT THE BURRITO\nPLACE, ONE MORE TIME, IN TERMS OF LOCATION, WAS WHERE AGAIN?\n>> 24th AND 7th, WHERE THE ONE TRAIN IS.\n>> Reporter: SO YOU COME OUT HERE ON 24th AND 7th AND YOU SEE\nTHE EXPLOSION. >> I DIDN'T COME OUT -- I WAS\nOUT HERE ALL DAY. IT WENT TO HOME DEPOT AND I WENT\nTO BURLINGTON AND THEN I WAS READY TO EAT.\nI WAS HUNGRY, SEE, I'M FASTING. SO I WENT OVER THERE TO GET ME A\nBURRITO AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE WAS THIS BIG BANG!\nI MEAN, A BAD BANG. >> DEBORAH, THANK YOU SO MUCH.\nVERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT. AGAIN, THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN\nHEARING IN TERMS OF OUR WITNESSES, JUST A GIANT BANG.\nYOU HEARD IT FROM DEBORA. SHE SAW PEOPLE COMING OUT WITH\nDUST ON THEIR EYES, RUNNING, A FIREBALL TYPE OF IMAGE THEY SAW\nBETWEEN THOSE CLOUDS OF SMOKE. THESE ARE THE KIND OF THING\nWE'RE HEARING. WE'LL BRING MORE TO YOU AS WE\nGET IT. >> 25 PEOPLE INJURED, AS POLICE\nHAVE BEEN TELLING US, AS WE'VE SAID.\nAND OBVIOUSLY, IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH, MUCH WORSE.\nBUT WE'LL HAVE PAT BRONSON ON THE PHONE RIGHT NOW, FORMER NEW\nYORK CITY POLICE DETECTIVE. WHAT DOES THIS SOUND LIKE TO\nYOU? YOU HAVE A POTENTIAL GAS\nEXPLOSIONS, THERE HAVE BEEN PROBLEMS WITH THAT IN NEW YORK\nCITY. NO SMELL OF GAS, ACCORDING TO\nWITNESSES. BUT WHEN YOU HEAR THIS BIG BOOM\nAND SMOKE, SAID TO BE IN A DUMPSTER, WHAT'S YOUR GUT TELL\nYOU?  >> WE LOST PAT --\n>> ARE YOU BACK, PAT? >> I'M BACK.\nWHAT'S YOUR GUT TELL YOU ABOUT THIS?\n>> SO ERIC, HERE'S THE THING. I'M NOT A BIG BELIEVER IN\nCOINCIDENCES. AND THE PROBABILITY OF THE TWO\nEVENTS OCCURRED TODAY, 11 HOURS AGO, A PIPE BOMB WENT OFF IN\nSEASIDE HEIGHTS, NEW JERSEY, OKAY, AT A MILITARY EVENT, A\nFOOT RACE, COMMEMORATING THE UNITED STATES MILITARY.\nAND THEN TONIGHT, WE HAVE AN EXPLOSION IN A DUMPSTER.\nSO LET'S LOOK AT IT LOGICALLY. A DUMPSTER IS NOT A CHEMICAL\nLAB. IT'S NOT A POWER PLANT.\nIT'S NOT A LOCATION WHERE AN ACCIDENTAL EXPLOSION COULD OCCUR\nBECAUSE OF A CONFLUENCE OF FACTORS OR A CONFLUENCE OF\nCHEMICALS. LIKE YOU MENTIONED WITH THE FLN\nBOMBING. THE REALITY IS, TO ME, I KNOW\nIT'S PREMATURE AND THERE'S A LOT OF FOG SWIRLING, WAS YOU HAVE 15\nNEW YORKERS, OSTENSIBLY, WHO HAVE BEEN INJURED BY A BOMB THAT\nEXPLODED IN A DUMPSTER. THINK ABOUT THAT.\nWHAT TOTALITY OF CIRCUMSTANCES COULD CAUSE IT OCCUR OTHERWISE\nWITHOUT IT BEING AN INTENTIONAL EVENT?\nYOU HAVE TO LOOK AT IT THROUGH THOSE PRAGMATIC LENSES.\nAND THEN YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT IT THROUGH THE PROBABILITY, AS YOU\nVERY ASTUTELY POINTED OUT, WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME WE HAD THAT\nKIND OF A BOMB EXPLOSION IN NEW YORK?\nPRETTY RARE. >> OUR ON THE JOBS FOR YEARS\nABOUT THIS, AND I REMEMBER COVERING THIS FOR MANY, MANY\nYEARS. AND GOING BACK BEFORE THAT.\nTHE POLICE HEADQUARTERS IN '82 OR SO, THEY PUT A BOMB ON THE\nQUARTER AND AN OFFICER WENT TO PICK UP THE SATCHEL, IT BLEW UP\nAND BLEW HIS HANDS OFF. WE'VE HAD INJURIES OF THE BRAVE\nAND COURAGEOUS LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS FOR MANY, MANY YEARS.\nHATS OFF TO THE BOMB SKBAUD THE NATIONAL GUARD WHO WERE IN THE\nAREA. ONE GUY WAS IN THE AREA.\nTHAT IS THE COURAGE, BRAVERY, INSPIRATION OF OUR COUNTRY, AND\nWHAT WE SAW IN 9/11 OCURING HERE TONIGHT.\nTHANKFULLY IT IS SMALL. THANKFULLY NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE\nARE INJURED. BUT YOU HAVE CONCERN.\nIS IT POSSIBLE SOMEONE OR SOME GROUP WOULD TARGET SUCH A\nDISPARATE AREA? HOW WOULD THEY KNOW THERE'S A\nMARINE RUN IN NEW JERSEY AND POTENTIALLY PLACE SOMETHING IN A\nDUMPSTER ON A SATURDAY NIGHT IN CHELSEA, OR DID I JUST ANSWER\nTHE QUESTION FOR YOU WHEN I SAID, A SATURDAY NIGHT IN\nCHELSEA? >> I THINK YOU ANSWERED THE\nQUESTION PARTIALLY. THE OTHER THING, IT'S\nOFTENTIMES, LET'S EXTRAPOLATE A STEP FURTHER.\nLET'S GIVE THEM THE CREDIT FOR MASTERMIND PLANNING THAT THEY\nPUT TOGETHER THE ACTIVITY IN SEASIDE HEIGHTS AT A FOOT RACE\nTO COMMEMORATE THE MILITARY. THE OVERARCHING PREMISE BEHIND\nTERRORISM IS TO TERRORIZE. TAKE A BOMB AND EXPLODE IT IN\nCHELSEA ON A SATURDAY NIGHT AND YOU HAVE THE TOTALITY OF\nFACTORS. 15 IN THE HOSPITAL AND A\nTERRORIZED PROPOSITION. THAT'S THE GOAL.\nTHEY DON'T NECESSARILY EMBRACE THE EXACT SAME SYMBOLIC EVENT\nTHAT WE DO. WE WORRY ABOUT THE FOURTH OF\nJULY AND OUR SUPER BOWL. BUT IF YOU TAKE A VERY PRAGMATIC\nCLOSE LOOK AT THE TIMING AND THE EVENTS AND INDICATES OF\nCOMPLETED TERRORIST EVENTS IN THE LAST THREE DECADES, IT\nDOESN'T WORK WITH THE DATES LIKE WE DO.\nIT'S ABOUT PUTTING US INTO A TERRORISM FRENZY WHERE WE'RE\nVICTIMIZED BY OURSELF. >> ISN'T THAT THE MODUS OPERANDI\nWE'VE SEEN IN ISRAEL FOR YEARS? TO SEW TERROR INDISCRIMINATELY,\nLIKE POTENTIALLY WE SEE HERE TONIGHT?\n>> EXACTLY, ERIC. AND THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT.\nIT'S ALL ABOUT THE UNANNOUNCED. IT'S ALL ABOUT THE UNANNOUNCED.\nIT WOULD BE VERY SIMPLE FOR THEM TO DO IT ON THE BIRTHDAY, OR\nINDEPENDENCE DAY OR CHRISTMAS DAY OR THE LAST DAY OF THE SUPER\nBOWL. BUT OF DOING IT ON A SATURDAY\nNIGHT IN LATE SEPTEMBER ON 23rd AND 6th.\nWHAT ABOUT THAT? THAT SPEAKS TO THE HEART OF THE\nWHOLE TERRORIST IDEOLOGY, WHICH IS, WE CAN BE ANYWHERE, ANYTIME.\nYOU CANNOT BE READY FOR US. >> AND HOW DO WE HARNESS THIS?\nAT THE 5K EARLIER TODAY, SOME COULD RIGHTFULLY SAY THAT\nGARBAGE CAN SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN OPEN FOR SOMEONE TO PUT A BOMB\nIN. IN NEW YORK CITY, WHEN YOU HAVE\nEVENTS LIKE BLOCK PARTIES, WHEN YOU HAVE PARADES, THEY PUT TAPE\nAND SEAL THE MANHOLE COVERS ON THE STREET.\nTHEY LOCK THE POST OFFICE MAILBOXES, SO YOU CAN'T PUT AN\nEXPLOSIVE DEVICE IN THE MAILBOX, AND TAKE THE GARBAGE CANS AWAY.\n>> RIGHT. BUT THE FACT IS, WE'RE IN A\nCAPITALISTIC DEMOCRACY. WE'RE IN AN OPEN SOCIETY.\nYOU SEAL AND WELD AND MAKE EVERY MANHOLE COVER, BUT THEN TO A\nDMPSTER, DO THE SAME THING, THEN THEY GO TO A GARBAGE CAN.\nWE HAVE TO BE PROACTIVE AND BE DECEITFULLY AND VERY PROACTIVELY\nINVOLVED IN PUTTING OUR AND THEIR SPACE, LEARNING THEIR\nMOVES, GATHERING THE INTELLIGENCE AND ACTING ON IT.\nTHAT'S THE ANSWER. BECAUSE WE'RE FAR TOO OPEN TO\nEVER EFFECTIVELY SEAL ALL THE POTENTIAL SPOTS.\nAND YOU SAW IT TODAY, A DUMPSTER.\nARE WE GOING TO START WELDING DUMPSTERS UP?\nIS THAT THE NEXT STEP? NOT LIKELY.\nWE'RE IN TROUBLE. >> PAT, WE'VE SEEN -- AND WE ARE\nNOT SUBSCRIBING THIS TO TERRORISM.\nTHERE IS NO CONFIRMATION. WE'VE GOT TO LISTEN TO\nWITNESSES. IT WAS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO BLOW\nOUT WINDOWS. THANKFULLY, ONLY MINOR INJURIES\nTONIGHT. WHERE WOULD YOU LOOK?\nWHERE WOULD YOU POINT TO? ISLAMIC TERRORISM STARTING IN\n1990, THAT HOTEL. 1993, THE BOMBING OF THE WORLD\nTRADE CENTER. 1995, LANDMARK BOMBING CASE BY\nTHE BLIND SHEIK. AND ON AND ON, THE SUBWAY ATTACK\nTHAT WAS PLANNED, TIMES SQUARE, A VAN WITH A BOMB IN TIMES\nSQUARE. WHERE WOULD YOU LOOK OR COULD IT\nBE SOMEWHERE ELSE? >> I'M SORRY, ERIC?\n>> WHERE WOULD YOU LOOK, PAT, FOR POTENTIAL SUSPECTS AND HOW\nDO THEY GO ABOUT TRYING TO PIECE THIS TOGETHER ON WHAT GROUP, IF\nTHERE IS ONE, POTENTIALLY DID THIS?\n>> YOU'RE BREAKING UP A LITTLE BIT.\nARE YOU REQUESTING AN ANSWER AS TO WHERE WOULD WE LOOK NEXT TO\nTRY TO MITIGATE THIS SORT OF THREAT?\n>> YES, TO TRY TO FIND OUT WHO DID THIS?\n>> THE REALITY IS, WE HAVE TO GO ON THE OFFENSIVE.\nAND OOUM NOT LOOKING TO GO ON A SERMON, BUT WE ARE FAR TOO OPEN.\nA DUMPSTER. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WELD EVERY\nDUMPSTER, BUT YOU HAVE TO BE PROACTIVE AND GATHER ACTIONABLE\nINTELLIGENCE. WHAT'S ACTIONABLE INTELLIGENCE?\nTHAT'S THE INTELLIGENCE THAT'S GOING TO INFORM AND SYNTHESIZE\nAGAINST OUR PLANS SO WE CAN GO AFTER THESE GUYS.\nWE'VE GOT TO PUT OUR PEOPLE IN THEIR SPACE AND KNOW WHAT\nTHEY'RE THINKING, AS MUCH AS WE CAN, AND REACT TO THEM.\n>> PAT -- >> AND AT AN EVENT LIKE TONIGHT,\nWHO KNOWS? HOW ARE YOU GOING TO STOP THAT?\nYOU'LL SEE. I'LL BET YOU ON THIS ONE.\n>> YOU KNOW, I HAVE TREMENDOUS FAITH IN OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT, IN\nTHE FBI, AND OUR OFFICIALS TO BE ABLE TO TRACK THIS DOWN.\nONE OF THE FIRST STEPS AND PLACES THEY START ARE THE\nCAMERAS. VIDEO CAMERAS ARE ALL OVER THE\nPLACE. OBVIOUSLY, THEY'LL BE LOOKING\nTHROUGH THOSE CAMERAS AND SEEING THAT.\nTHERE WE SEE SOME OF THE EMS OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK WITH SOME\nOF THEIR EQUIPMENT, OBVIOUSLY. AS WE SAID, 25 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN\nINJURED. THANKFULLY, THE INJURIES HAVE\nBEEN MINOR THIS EVENING. WHEN THIS EXPLOSION OF SOME\nNATURE ERUPTED SUDDENLY WITH A LOUD BANG, BLEW OUT WINDOWS OF\nTHE APARTMENT BUILDINGS IN A BROWNSTONE THERE, RINGING AND\nSTICKING IN THE PEOPLE'S EARS, OCCURRED AT 8:30 THIS EVENING ON\nTHE CORNER OF THE 23rd STREET, THE CHELSEA SECTION OF MANHATTAN\nON A SATURDAY NIGHT. LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THAT.\nIT'S A BUSY, PACKED SATURDAY NIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK CITY.\nYOU'VE GOT THE CHELSEA HOTEL, WHICH IS A VERY TRENDY SPOT,\nRIGHT ON THAT BLOCK. YOU'VE GOT A TERRIFIC SPANISH\nRESTAURANT RIGHT THERE ON THAT BLOCK.\nYOU'VE GOT CLUBS, RESTAURANTS, PEOPLE OUT IN A BEAUTIFUL LATE\n70s, EARLY 80s TEMPERATURE ON A FALL DAY THAT'S MILD AND BALMY.\nTHE STREETS OF THE CITY ARE PACKED TONIGHT.\nAND THEN IN A DUMPSTER OR BY A GARBAGE CAN, THERE IS SOME TYPE\nOF EXPLOSION THAT OCCURRED THAT BRINGS THE VERY REAL FEARS THAT\nWE HAVE GONE THROUGH IN THIS CITY AND IN THIS COUNTRY ALL\nTHESE YEARS TO THE FORE. NO KRPGS THAT THIS IS TERRORISM.\nNO CONFIRMATION THAT THIS WAS EVEN AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE OF ANY\nSORT. NO CONFIRMATION THAT THIS WAS A\nBOMB. BUT IT CERTAINLY SOUNDS LIKE\nTHAT. NO ONE TONIGHT SO FAR SAYING\nTHAT THEY SMELLED. SMELL OF GAS, WHICH WOULD BE THE\nFIRST THING YOU WOULD THINK DURING A GAS EXPLOSION.\nVERY EARLY ON IN THE INVESTIGATION.\nWE DO NOT WANT TO RUSH TO ANY UNWARRANTED CONCLUSIONS, BUT\nCLEARLY, AS WE'VE BEEN REPORTING TONIGHT, MANY QUESTIONS IN LIGHT\nOF THE FACT IN SEASIDE HEIGHTS, NEW JERSEY, EARLIER TODAY, A\nPIPE BOMB DID GO OFF ON THE ROUTE OF A 5K BY THE MARINES\nTHAT WOULD BENEFIT MARINE FAMILIES.\nSO WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU? ON THE PHONE NOW, BILL DALEY,\nFORMER FBI INVESTIGATOR. BILL, WHAT DO WE DO?\n>> ERIC, I THINK THE FIRST THING AS WE START TO LOOK AT THIS\nSCENE IS REALLY HAVE THE BOMB TECHNICIANS START TO BE ABLE TO\nCALL THROUGH THE AREA AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ACTUALLY THEY\nHAVE BEEN, THE THING THAT EXPLODED THERE.\nWAS THERE A DEVICE, SOME OTHER EXPLANATION.\nTHIS WHOLE AREA, AS THE VIEWERS ARE SEEING, IS REALLY A CRIME\nSCENE, BECAUSE THE DUMPSTER WENT OFF, THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN\nSHRAPNEL OR OTHER DEBRIS, PERHAPS PARTS OF IF, IT WAS, IN\nFACT, A DEVICE, SCATTERED AROUND THE AREA.\nI THINK YOU ALLUDED TO IT EARLIER, A COUPLE OF INCIDENTS\nIN NEW YORK CITY PB FRANCIS TOWNGREN AND THE BOMBING AT\nLa PART OF FBI'S CRIME SCENE RESPONSE TEAM THAT\nWENT OUT THERE. SO I'M KIND OF FAMILIAR WITH\nTHESE TEAMS. AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WIDER\nSWATH OF AREA BE CORDONED OFF AND ALL THE EVIDENCE GATHERED.\n>> BILL, ARE THEY RIGHT NOW, OBVIOUSLY, THINKING OR\nSUSPECTING IT COULD BE AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE?\nGATHERING METAL FRAGMENTS. THEY SOLVED THE 1993 BOMBING OF\nTHE WORLD TRADE CENTER WHEN UP WITH OF THE TERRORISTS TRIED TO\nGET HIS DEPOSIT BACK AT THE RENT-A-CAR PLACE WHERE THEY\nRENTED THE VAN. AND THEY WERE ABLE TO FIND THE\nVIN NUMBER OF THE VAN AND SOLVED THAT.\n>> COULD IT HAVE BEEN CHERRY BOMBS, KIDS?\n>> THAT WILL BE THE ANALYSIS THEY COULD DO FAIRLY QUICKLY.\nSO IF THEY DO FIND THAT, IT IS THAT DUMPSTER, THEY CAN DO SOME\nSAMPLING INSIDE OF THAT, TO DETERMINE WHAT TYPE OF MATERIAL,\nWHAT TYPE OF RESIDUE IS LEFT OVER TO FURTHER, YOU KNOW,\nUNDERSTAND WHETHER IT COULD HAVE BEEN.\nI THINK, ALSO, YOU KNOW, I THINK REMAINDER DURING THESE TYPE OF\nINCIDENTS DOES ERR ON THE SIDE THAT IT COULD BE A TRUE\nINCIDENT. THEY'RE GOING TO HANDLE IT AS A\nCRIME SCENE, BUT ALSO BE KIND OF WARY OF THE FACT THAT, YOU KNOW,\nYOU CALL EVERYBODY TO ONE AREA AND SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENS OTHER\nPLACES AND OR PEOPLE ARE DRAWN INTO AN AREA, FIRST RESPONDERS,\nAS YOU KNOW, AND PERHAPS THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THERE.\nTHEY HAVE TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS, AS THEY GO THROUGH THESE STEPS,\nBECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S AROUND, AND BECAUSE THAT AREA IS\nBOTH A VERY LIVELY AREA WITH SHOPS AND RESTAURANTS OPEN,\nPEDESTRIANS ON THE STREET AND MANY PLACES IF SOMEBODY REALLY\nWANTED TO HIDE A DEVICE, THEY COULD DO THAT.\nSO THEY HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL AS THEY GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS.\nONE OF THE THINGS YOU MENTIONED, ERIC, WHICH IS REALLY KEY, AND\nESPECIALLY IN A PLACE LIKE NEW YORK CITY, ESPECIALLY IN A PLACE\nAROUND 23rd STREET AND 6th AVENUE ARE THE MULTITUDE OF\nCAMERAS THAT ARE OUT THERE. BOTH THE -- THERE ARE MANY\nCAMERAS THAT THE NYPD HAS PUT UP ON LAMP POLES IN AND AROUND THE\nAREA, BUT ALSO ALL THE PRIVATE CAMERAS, CAMERAS THAT COMMERCIAL\nESTABLISHMENTS AND EVEN PRIVATE PEOPLE HAVE PUT UP FOR THEIR OWN\nSECURITY. >> WHAT HAPPENS WITH THEM RIGHT\nNOW? HOW LONG DO THEY LAST?\nBUT IT TAKES SOME TIME TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THIS.\nYOU'VE GOT TO GO SHOP TO SHOP, DOOR TO DOOR, BUILDING THE\nBUILDING. A LOT OF BUILDINGS IN NEW YORK\nCITY, THEY HAVE THE CAMERAS IN THE LOBBY AND THIS WILL TAKE\nSOME TIME. >> IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME, AND\nTHE FIRST THING WILL BE TO FIND OUT IF THIS IS A DEVICE, ARE\nTHERE REMNANTS OF IT, AND LAW ENFORCEMENT BOTH ON THE FEDERAL\nAND LOCAL LEVEL HAVE DONE EXTENSIVE TRAINING WITH THEIR\nBOMB DETECTION TEAMS BY BLOWING UP VARIOUS TYPES OF DEVICES, SO\nWHEN THEY GO INTO A SCENE, THEY CAN ALREADY HAVE KIND OF A\nFINGERPRINT, IF YOU WILL, OF THE WAY THE DEVICE WENT OFF, WHICH\nIS AN INDICATION OF PERHAPS WHAT THE MATERIAL USED WAS OR WHETHER\nIT WAS A PIPE BOMB, WHETHER IT WAS SOME TYPE OF CANISTER,\nWHETHER IT WAS ATTACHED TO A PROPANE TANK AS THE TERRORISTS\nUSED BACK IN THE '70s. WAS THERE SOMETHING LIKE THAT\nINVOLVED? SO WHEN THEY GO THERE AND START\nTO LOOK AT THE PHYSICAL MANIFESTATION OF THE CRIME\nSCENE, THEY'RE ABLE TO START TO PIECE TOGETHER PRETTY QUICKLY TO\nSAY, THAT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE \"X\" AS OPPOSED TO\nAN ACCIDENT. ARE.\n>> BILL, YOU MENTIONED THE WORD \"DEVICE,\" AND I DON'T WANT TO\nGET AHEAD OF THE STORY. THERE IS NO CONFIRMATION OF\nTHIS, WHAT HAPPENED, WHAT WAS IN THERE, PARTICULARLY.\nWE HAVE HAD GAS EXPLOSIONS IN NEW YORK.\nONE LEVELLED A BUILDING WHEN THERE WAS AN ILLEGAL GAS HOOKUP\nTHAT BLEW THAT BUILD UP IN THE LOWER EAST SIDE OF MANHATTAN,\nBUT CLEARLY THIS IS THE HISTORY BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED EARLIER\nIN SEASIDE HEIGHTS, BUT NEW YORK CITY BEING THE EPICENTER OF WHAT\nTERRORISTS SAYING THEY WANT TO TARGET AND THE LIKE.\nBILL, LAST WORD, TEN SECONDS. >> AGAIN, RULING IT OUT, WHETHER\nIT'S SOMETHING THAT WAS ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, A\nPUT-TOGETHER DEVICE OR SOMETHING THAT JUST OCCURRED BY ITSELF,\nCERTAINLY COINCIDENTAL WITH THE INCIDENT IN JERSEY RAISES THE\nCONCERNS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS AS THEY\nAPPROACH AND DRILL FURTHER DOWN INTO THE INVESTIGATION.\n>> BILL DALEY, FORMERLY OF THE FBI, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR\nJOINING US ON THE FOX NEWS, OUR COVERAGE LIVE HERE IN NEW YORK\nCONTINUES OF THIS EXPLOSION.",

HILLARY CLINTON AND HER CAMPAIGN\nOF 2008 STARTED THE BIRTHER CONTROVERSY.\nI FINISHED IT. I FINISHED IT.\nYOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA WAS BORN\nIN THE UNITED STATES, PERIOD. >> AND HE WALKED OFF WITHOUT\nTAKING QUESTIONS. JOINING ME NOW, KELLY RIDDELL.\nAND JOE TRIPPY, THE DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST AND FOX NEWS\nCONTRIBUTOR. ERIN, JOURNALISTS WERE REALLY\nANGRY, SOME OF THEM WERE STANDING ON CHAIRS AND SHOUTING\nQUESTIONS AT TRUMP AS HE WALKED AWAY.\nDID TRUMP DO A BAIT AND SWITCH TO DRAW THAT ALMOST NONSTOP\nCABLE COVERAGE FOR WHAT WE THOUGHT WERE MAJOR REMARKS ON\nTHE BIRTHER ISSUE? >> HE SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID HE WAS\nGOING TO TAKE QUESTIONS AND THEN NOT TAKE QUESTIONS.\n>> I'M NOT SURE HE WAS SAYING THAT.\n>> CNN LOOKED ESPECIALLY WHINEY BECAUSE ALL THEIR ANCHORS WERE\nSAYING WE WERE DUPED. FOR AT LEAST A YEAR THE NETWORKS\nHAVE BEEN TAKING TRUMP'S EVENTS LIVE.\nTHEY COULD HAVE DECIDED TO GO INTO THE EVENT WHEN DONALD TRUMP\nSTARTED SPEAKING ABOUT THE BIRTHER COMMENTS.\nTHEY DIDN'T HAVE TO TAKE THE WHOLE EVENT LIVE.\nTHE OTHER THING I WOULD POINT OUT, DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN\nSMEARED THROUGH THE PRESS FOR BEING THE KING OF TAX BREAKS FOR\nALL KIND OF OTHER PROBLEMS HE'S HAD WITH HIS HOTEL CHAINS.\nHERE HE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY WITH TWO MONTHS LEFT TO GO BEFORE\nELECTION DAY TO REMIND EVERYTHING OF THE SUCCESS HE'S\nHAD. WHY PEOPLE LIKE HIM IN THE FIRST\nPLACE. I THOUGHT IT WAS A SMART PUBLIC\nRELATIONS MOVE ON HIS POINT. >> NOBODY FORCED THE CABLE\nNETWORKS TO STAY WITH THAT EVENT UNTIL HE GOT TO THE MAIN TOPIC,\nBUT WAS DONALD TRUMP, IN EFFECT, FORCED, PRESSURED TO DO THIS BY\nTHE MEDIA BECAUSE HIS TOP SURROGATES, RUDY GIULIANI AND\nKELLYANNE CONWAY WENT ON AND SAID WE BELIEVE OBAMA WAS BORN\nIN THE UNITED STATES, THEN PEOPLE ASKED WHY ISN'T HE\nSAYING? >> HE TWEETED EARLIER DON'T\nBELIEVE ANYONE YOU HEAR OTHER THAN ME, I'M THE OFFICIAL WORD\nON EVERYTHING, SO, YES, I THINK HE HAD TO COME OUT AND PUT THIS\nISSUE TO REST, BECAUSE IT WAS PERCOLATING IN THE PRESS AND NOW\nHE CAN SAY I BELIEVE OBAMA IS A U.S. CITIZEN AND THAT'S\nIMPORTANT IN HIS REHABILITATION EFFORT.\nI WOULD SAY WHAT I FOUND VERY APPALLING ABOUT THE MEDIA\nCOVERAGE AT THIS WAS THE DEBATE OF DONALD TRUMP IS HE CORRECTED\nONE FALSEHOOD, BUT THEN GAVE TWO OTHERS.\nNOW, THERE IS INDISPUTABLE, FACT CHECKERS HAVE SAID HILLARY\nCLINTON DIDN'T START THE 2007 BIRTHER RUMOR, BUT SHE, IN FACT,\nDID. STARTED WITH A MARK PENN MEMO IN\n2007. >> SHE DIDN'T PERSONALLY.\n>> HER CAMPAIGN DID. HE SAID SHE AND HER CAMPAIGN.\nTHEN HER CAMPAIGN MANAGER WENT ON CNN ON FRIDAY, YEAH, WE HAD A\nSTAFFER WHO SENT A BIRTHER E-MAIL OUT AND WE FIRED THEM.\nTHAT CAME FROM THE CAMPAIGN. >> LET ME GET YOU IN ON THIS,\nTHE STAFFER WAS A VOLUNTEER THAT WAS FIRED, INTERNAL MEMO, DIDN'T\nTALK ABOUT OBAMA'S CITIZENSHIP, BUT TALKED ABOUT PAINTING HIM AS\nAN OTHER AND A REPORTER NOW SAYS BLUMENTHAL ACTUALLY TOLD THIS\nREPORTER THAT OBAMA MIGHT HAVE BEEN BORN ELSEWHERE,\nBLUMENTHALEN DENIES THAT. IS THE PRESS HOLDING TRUMP\nACCOUNTABLE FOR MAKING THIS CHARGE AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON\nHIMSELF IN THE SAME TWO SENTENCES WHERE HE'S SAYING I\nACCEPT OBAMA IS AMERICAN? >> YEAH, THEY ARE.\nLET'S GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL THING, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE\nMANIPULATING THE MEDIA TO GET COVERAGE, I'M SHOCKED ABOUT\nTHAT. SO I AGREE ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THAT\nTHEY'VE GOT DUPED INTO IT, BUT THEN THEY WENT WITH IT AND\nSTAYED WITH IT. ON THIS ISSUE, THOUGH, LOOK,\nTHERE WERE VOLUNTEERS IN THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN SPREAD\nSOMETHING OR SOMEBODY NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.\nTHIS IS A GUY WHO RAN FOR PRESIDENT, IS RUNNING FOR\nPRESIDENT, AND THE REASON HE GOT THE NOMINATION, BIG PIECE OF IT,\nWAS HIM PLAYING TO THE BIRTHER MOVEMENT AND THE COVERAGE HE GOT\nABOUT THAT. SO TO SHOW UP FIVE YEARS LATER\nAND JUST SORT OF, LIKE, HEY, I FINISHED IT, IT'S OVER --\n>> WE'LL GET INTO THIS MORE LATER IN THE PROGRAM, BUT THERE\nALSO SEEMS TO BE A THEME IN THE MEDIA THAT HE DIDN'T APOLOGIZE,\nHE NEEDED TO APOLOGIZE BECAUSE HE DID PUSH THIS BEGINNING FIVE\nYEARS AGO. FAIR OR UNFAIR?\n>> HAS HE EVER APOLOGIZED FOR ANYTHING?\nOF COURSE HE WASN'T GOING TO APOLOGIZE.\n>> THAT'S NOT HIS STYLE. >> STOP COMPLAINING ABOUT IT.\n>> WHAT DID YOU THINK IN MY INTERVIEW WITH HIM AS HE TALKED\nABOUT THE DISGUSTINGLY DISHONEST MEDIA THAT HE IS SAYING IN\nADVANCE, THE DEBATE MOD RATE TORS WILL ALL BE UNFAIR,\nPREEMPTIVE STRIKE? >> I THINK THAT STARTED EARLIER\nWITH THE MATT LAUER INTERVIEW WHEN HILLARY CLINTON STARTED\nFUNDRAISING OFF OF THE FACT THAT MATT LAUER WAS SO UNFAIR TO HER\nIN THAT, AND ALL OF HER SURROGATES WENT ON TV AND SAID\nMATT LAUER DID NOT HIT DONALD TRUMP LIKE HE NEEDED TO, DIDN'T\nFACT CHECK ON THE SPOT, AND THAT WAS CIG FALLING TO LESTER HOLT,\nTO CHRIS WALLACE, TO THE MODERATORS, YOU BETTER, YOU\nBETTER GO AFTER DONALD TRUMP AND YOU BETTER, PERHAPS, LAY OFF\nHILLARY CLINTON OR WE'RE GOING TO QUESTION YOUR CREDIBILITY.\n>> THAT ASSUMES THESE ARE NOT JOURNALISTS THAT CAN WITHSTAND\nPRESSURE AND I WILL WITHHOLD JUDGMENT UNTIL WE SEE THESE\nDEBATES.

THEY WERE HARDENED CRIMINALS.\nTHEY COMMITTED OR ALLEGED TO HAVE COMMITTED NEARLY 500,000\nCRIMES. >> TRUMP IS ALSO GETTING A LOT\nOF ATTENTION TODAY FOR SOMETHING HE SAID LAST NIGHT IN MAI,\nSUGGESTING THAT IF HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO BE TOUGH ON GUN\nCONTROL, HER BODYGUARDS SHOULD PUT DOWN THEIR GUNS.\nTRUMP FOLLOWED UP ON TWITTER AFTERWARDS, WRITING, QUOTE,\nCROOKED HILLARY WANTS TO TAKE YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS\nAWAY. WILL GUNS BE TAKEN FROM HER\nHEAVILY ARMED SECRET SERVICE DETAIL?\nMAYBE NOT. TRUMP DID LEAVE TEXAS IN THE\nLAST HOUR OR SO.

AND KRISTEN FISHER IS FOLLOWING\nALL OF THIS FOR US, LIVE FROM WASHINGTON THIS AFTERNOON.\nHI, KRISTEN. >> HEY, JULIE.\nWELL, TODAY, THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS FIRING BACK ON TWO\nFRONTS, FIRST ON THE BIRTHER CONTROVERSY AND THEN ON THE\nCOMMENT THAT TRUMP MADE LAST NIGHT THAT CLINTON'S BODYGUARDS\nSHOULD BE STRIPPED OF THEIR FIREARMS AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO\nHER. HE ISSUED A STATEMENT THAT READS\nIN PART, QUOTE, THIS KIND OF TALK SHOULD BE OUT OF BOUNDS FOR\nA PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, JUST LIKE IT SHOULD BE OUT OF BOUND\nFOR A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE TO PEDAL A CONSPIRACY THEORY ABOUT\nTHE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR FIVE YEARS.\nTHAT CONSPIRACY THEORY IS NOW THE SUBJECT OF A NEW CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN VIDEO RELEASED THIS MORNING.\nIT SAYS, WHILE TRUMP TRIED TO PUT HIS BIRTHERISM BEHIND HIM\nYESTERDAY, HE MADE IT WORSE. SO THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS\nREALLY DOING HIS BEST TO MAKE SURE TRUMP TEASE MAJOR REVERSAL\nON THIS ISSUE DOES NOT GO UNNOTICED.\nAT THE SAME TIME, THOUGH, THEY'RE ALSO RULING OUT A NEW\nSTRATEGY TO TRY TO APPEAL TO A DEMOGRAPHIC THAT CLINTON'S\nREALLY BEEN STRUGGLING WITH. YOUNG MILLENNIAL VOTERS.\nTODAY, TWO SUPERSTAR SURROGATES, SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS AND\nSENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN ARE MAKING THE CASE FOR CLINTON ON\nCOLLEGE CAMPUSES ALL OVER OHIO. AND YESTERDAY, FIRST LADY\nMICHELLE OBAMA DELIVERED A SIMILAR MESSAGE DURING HER FIRST\nSOLO CAMPAIGN STOP THIS SEASON. >> AND LET'S BE CLEAR, ELECTIONS\nAREN'T JUST ABOUT WHAT VOTES, BUT WHO DOESN'T VOTE.\nAND THAT IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE, LIKE ALL OF YOU.\n>> I HOPE YOU'LL GET INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS, REGISTER YOUR\nFRIENDS. TOO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE ARE NOT\nREGISTERED TO VOTE. I HOPE THAT YOU WORK WITH THE\nLOCAL CAMPUS ORGANIZATION, KNOCK ON DOORS.\n>> AND JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF HOW IMPORTANT THIS\nDEMOGRAPHIC IS FOR THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN, ON MONDAY, SHE SET TO\nDELIVER A SPEECH AIMED ENTIRELY AT MILLENNIAL VOTERS, BUT FIRST,\nSHE HAS TO ATTEND TO ANOTHER KEY VOTING GROUP, AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nVOTERS AT TONIGHT'S CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS GALA.\nJULIE? >> ALL RIGHT, KRISTEN FISHER,\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH. KELLY?\n>> ALL RIGHT, JULIE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nLET'S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK NOW AT THE MILLENNIAL VOTE.\nA NEW POLL SHOWS HILLARY CLINTON HAS A NARROW LEAD, LET'S LOOK AT\nIT, WITH 31%. TRUMP IS FIVE POINTS BEHIND.\nAND GOVERNOR GARY JOHNSON, WELL, HE'S JUST TWO POINTS BEHIND WITH\n29% AND JILL STEIN HAS 15%. SO JOINING US NOW, TAMMY BRUCE,\nRADIO TALK SHOW HOST AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR, AND CAPRI\nKATAFFARO, FORMER OHIO STATE SENATOR MINORITY LEADER.\nLADIES, THANKS FOR JOINING US AND WEIGHING IN ON THIS\nMILLENNIAL ISSUE, BECAUSE IT'S LOOMING TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT\nONE. BASED ON WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THAT\nPOLLING THERE, WE CAN SEE THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS KIND OF AN\nUPHILL BATTLE IN TERMS OF GAINING THE MILLENNIAL VOTE, SHE\nALWAYS HAS SINCE BERNIE SANDERS WAS THE MORE POPULAR CANDIDATE.\nBUT WHAT KIND OF IMPACT DOES A FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA,\nSENATOR BERNIE SANDERS, AND SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN HAVE ON\nTHE MILLENNIALS AND TRYING TO GET THEM TO MOVE THEIR VOTE, AND\nEVEN REGISTER, BY THE WAY, TO VOTE FOR HILLARY CLINTON?\n>> WELL, I WOULD SAY THAT IT WOULD MATTER IF THEY WERE THE\nCANDIDATE, RIGHT? IF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WERE AT THE\nTOP OF THE TICKET. HERE'S HILLARY CLINTON'S\nPROBLEM. YOUNGER VOTERS AND MILLENNIALS,\nWHILE THEY'LL GO TO RALLIES AND BE ENTHUSIASTIC, DON'T VOTE.\nIT'S A MATTER OF FACT THAT THE BABY BOOMERS ARE VOTING AT 30%\nHIGHER THAN THEIR CHILDREN'S GENERATION.\nAND THAT'S A HARD THING TO REACH OVER.\nTHEY'LL ALSO VOTE, THOUGH, FOR BIG BLOCKBUSTER ELECTIONS, LIKE\nA BARACK OBAMA ELECTION, WHERE IT'S REALLY REVOLUTIONARY.\nHILLARY CLINTON IS CLEARLY THE ESTABLISHMENT.\nAND INTERESTINGLY, EVERYTHING THAT THE REPUBLICANS ARE\nREACTING TO, TRUMP SUPPORTERS ARE REACTING TO, SO ARE THE\nMILLENNIALS. AS AMERICANS, THEY WANT CHANGE,\nTHEY DON'T WANT THE STATUS QUO. SO THEY SEE THOSE OTHER\nINDIVIDUALS AS MAKING A CHANGE, JUST BY THEIR EXISTENCE.\nTHEY DON'T SEE HILLARY AS DOING THAT.\nSO SHE HAS TO OVERCOME THAT IMAGE, WHICH WILL BE DIFFICULT,\nBUT SHE WILL ALSO HAVE TO GET OVER TO THE POINT WHERE THEY\nJUST DON'T GO TO THE POLLS. AND EVEN THE ENTHUSIASM GAP IS\nGOING TO ADD TO THAT PROBLEM. >> CAPRI, WEIGH IN ON THIS FOR\nME. WHY AREN'T MILLENNIAL VOTERS\nGETTING BEHIND HILLARY CLINTON, WHEN IT WOULD SEEM THAT BERNIE\nSANDERS, WHO'S ALREADY GONE OUT THERE TO ENDORSE HER, WOULD HAVE\nBEEN ABLE TO GET THEM TO HER SEAT AT THE TABLE?\n>> WELL, I HAVE TO SAY THAT I'M A PROUD GEN-Xer, NOT A\nMILLENNIAL, AND SOMETIMES I SCRATCH MY HEAD ON WHY THEY MAKE\nTHE DECISIONS THAT THEY MAKE, FOR EXAMPLE, SUPPORTING\n74-YEAR-OLD BERNIE SANDERS, AS OPPOSED TO HILLARY CLINTON, THE\nFIRST FEMALE NOMINEE OF A MAJOR NATIONAL PARTY.\nBUT, OBVIOUSLY, I MEAN, THE BERNIE SANDERS MESSAGE WAS VERY\nMUCH TAILORED TOWARDS WHAT MILLENNIALS CARE ABOUT IN\nREGARDS TO INCOME INEQUALITY AND COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY AND THINGS\nOF THAT NATURE. AS TAMMY SAID, THERE IS AN ISSUE\nWITH REGARD TO NOT LIKING THE ESTABLISHMENT, HILLARY CLINTON,\nAND DONALD TRUMP, AND THAT POLL YOU JUST SHOWED HAS ISSUES WITH\nYOUNGER VOTERS. BECAUSE I THINK YOUNGER VOTERS\nFEEL THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT, FOR WHATEVER IT'S WORTH, ARE\nDISAFFECTED, THEY ARE NOT LISTENING TO THEIR NEEDS, AND\nIT'S GOING TO BE AN UPHILL BATTLE TO BOTH OF THEM.\nI HAVE ONE THING TO SAY TO MY YOUNG COLLEAGUES, AND THERE'S\nTWO WORDS THERE, RALPH NADER. YOU VOTE FOR GARY JOHNSON OR\nJILL STEIN, YOU'RE GOING END TO UP WITH DONALD TRUMP, AND I CAN\nGUARANTEE YOU THAT'S LESS PROGRESSIVE THAN HILLARY\nCLINTON. >> TAMMY?\n>> BUT THIS IS THE ISSUE. THEY'RE NOT EVEN GOING TO BE IN\nTHAT VOTING BOOTH, TRADITIONALLY.\nYOU'RE LOOKING AT DONALD TRUMP'S WHEELHOUSE, THE PEOPLE AT OVER\n45 YEARS OLD, THEY VOTE, 70 TO 80%, THAT KIND OF DYNAMIC.\nTHEY'RE USED TO VOTING. SO ONCE THEY DO GET IN THERE,\nWHEN THEY LOOK AT WHO THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR, AND THE\nREASON THEY'RE NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR HILLARY IS THE SAME REASON,\nTHEY DON'T TRUST HER SO MUCH. WITH BERNIE SANDERS, IT HAS\nNOTHING TO DO WITH AGE, WHEN IT COMES TO WHOM IS ATTRACTED TO\nWHOM, IT'S ABOUT SINCERITY AND TRUSTWORTHINESS.\n>> LET ME ANSWER THAT POINT. BECAUSE JAMISON FOIRZ, A SENIOR\nADVISER FOR THE GROUP, NEXT-GEN CLIMATE, I'M QUOTING HIM HERE,\nTHE MORE THEY SUPPORT -- ACTUALLY, HE GOES ON TO SAY, TOO\nMANY MILLENNIALS ACTUALLY DON'T SEE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CLINTON\nAND DONALD TRUMP. THAT'S A PROBLEM, NOT ONLY FOR\nCLINTON, BUT ALSO FOR DONALD TRUMP.\n>> I THINK THAT'S VERY SHORTSIGHTED MY THE MILLENNIALS.\nI GET WHAT THEY'RE SAYING WITH, A BECAUSE WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO\nSAY, THEMORE PROGRESSIVE FOLKS IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY ARE\nSAYING, WELL, HILLARY CLINTON IS, YOU KNOW, SHE'S AN\nESTABLISHMENT WALL STREET. SHE IS IN THE POCKET OF BIG\nBUSINESS, AND YOU KNOW, FILL IN THE BLANK, BIG OIL, WHATEVER THE\nSITUATION MAY BE. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT\nDIFFERENCES BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON, AND YOU\nKNOW, AGAIN, THIS IS WHERE I THING THEY NEED TO SHOW UP.\nIF THEY REALLY DO CARE ABOUT MAKING PROGRESS, THEY HAVE TO\nUNDERSTAND, LOOK AT THE  THE ONLY PLACE WHERE THEY HAVE\nANY SIMILARITIES IS IN TRADE. >> SO AS WE HEARD KRISTEN FISHER\nIN THAT REPORT, THAT HILLARY CLINTON WILL BE ADDRESSING\nMILLENNIALS SPECIFICALLY ON MONDAY, SO TAMMY, WHAT DO YOU\nANTICIPATED HILLARY CLINTON SAYING?\n>> SHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO ADDRESS THE THINGS THAT THEY'VE\nBEEN HIT HARD ON THESE LAST SEVEN YEARS.\nUNFORTUNATELY, SHE'S OFFERING MORE OF THE SAME.\nSHE'S GOING TO DIFFERENTIATE HERSELF FROM OBAMA ON THE\nECONOMY. THESE ARE COLLEGE-EDUCATED\nINDIVIDUALS, WHO CAN'T GET A JOB, OR WHEN THEY DO, THEY CAN'T\nPAY ANY OF THEIR BILLS. THEY'VE BEEN HIT HARD ON THE\nISSUE OF VIOLENCE IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES.\nTHEY'VE SEEN WHAT THEY DON'T LIKE, AND SHE'S BEEN A PART OF\nTHAT. SO IN SOME WAYS, SHE WANT TO\nATTACH HERSELF TO MR. OBAMA. ON THE OTHER HAND, SHE HAS TO\nSAY, SHE'S MORE LIKE THE REPUBLICANS IN PROMISING MORE\nJOBS -- >> WELCOME TO A GENERAL\nELECTION. >> AND LAW AND ORDER.\n>> WE'LL HAVE TO END IT THERE. CAPRI AND TAMMY, THANK YOU SO\nMUCH. OBVIOUSLY, THE MILLENNIALS ARE\nALWAYS CONCERNED ABOUT THOSE STUDENT LOANS.\nA LOT OF DEBT THERE, AS WELL. ANYWAY, DON'T MIX FOX NEWS\nSUNDAY. HERE'S WHY, DEMOCRATIC VICE\nPRESIDENT NOMINEE TIM KAINE AND TRUMP ADVISER GOVERNOR CHRIS\nCHRISTIE JOIN CHRIS WALLACE TO WEIGH IN ON THIS WEEK'S\nPOLITICAL HEADLINES.

AND I THINK THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN\nMADE THE DECISION THAT IN AUGUST VOTERS AREN'T REALLY PAYING\nATTENTION. LOT OF FOCUS ON VACATION AND\nHEADED BACK TO SCHOOL. SO NAY REALLY WANTED TO ROLL\nPEOPLE OUT IN SEPTEMBER. EXPECT TO SEA ALL THE SURKTS IN\nTHE COME WEEKS. AS DWRN THEY HAVE WORK TO DO TO\nHELP CLINTON WITH MILLENNIAL VOTERS.\nSHE'S REALLY STRUGGLING THERE AND THERE IS A GROUP OF VOTERS\nESSENTIAL TO THE DEMOCRATIC COALITION AND YOUNG VOTE WHO ARE\nLEAN LIBERAL DIDN'T SUPPORT CLINTON BY AND LARGE.\nTHEY OPTED FOR SANDERS.

BECAUSE HERRED A VIESHZS NOTE\nTHEY HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT YOUNG VOTERS NOT SHOWING UP OR\nDEFECTING TO THIRD PARTY CANDIDATES.\nSO SOME OF THEM ARE SHIFTING TO GARY JOHNSON, THE LIBERTARIAN\nCANDIDATE. >> CLINTON FACES A CHALLENGE\nWINNING OVER MILLENNIALS IN OHIO.\nAND THAT IS A STATE BY THE WAY WHERE A LOT OF NON EXTENDED, NON\nKLEIN EDUCATED PEOPLE THERE. AND THAT IS A BASE FOR DONALD\nTRUMP. SO THE WHAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE\nTRYING TO DO IS APPEAL TO THE COLLEGE EDUCATED YOUNGER\nMILLENNIALS AND THEN YOU HAVE THE FIRST LADY COMING OUT SORT\nOF MAING DIGS AT TRUMP WITHOUT NECESSARILY NAMING HIM BUT WE\nKNOW WHO SHE'S TALKING ABOUT HERE.\nLET'S RL IF TAPE. >> WE ALSO NEED SOMEONE WHO IS\nSTEADY AND MEASURED. BECAUSE WHEN YOU MAKING LIFE OR\nDEATH, WAR OR PEACE DECISIONS, A PRESIDENT CAN'T JUST POP OFF.\n>> SO CLEARLY YOU ARE GETTING ALL YOUR HEAVY HITTERS COMING\nOUT.

AND WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT ONE OF\nTHE BEST PRESIDENTS THIS COUNTRY HAS EVER HAD, BARACK OBAMA?\nI IS MADE THE POINT OVER AND OVER AGAIN, PRESIDENT OBAMA\nSAVED OUR COUNTRY FROM A SECOND GREAT DEPRESSION, HE BROUGHT\nOSAMA BIN LADEN TO JUSTICE. AND SO MUCH MORE, I DON'T THINK\nHE GETS THE CREDIT THAT HE'S DONE FOR OUR COUNTRY AND THE\nWORLD. AND IT'S NOT JUST THE PRESIDENT\nHE'S BEEN, BUT THE MAN HE IS. EVEN WHEN HATEFUL NONSENSE IS\nTHROWN THEIR WAY. BARACK, MICHELLE, THEIR TWO\nBEAUTIFUL DAUGHTERS HAVE REPRESENTED OUR COUNTRY WITH\nCLASS, GRACE AND INTEGRITY. AS MICHELLE SAYS, WHEN OTHERS GO\nLOW, WE GO HIGH. I KNOW I SPEAK FOR NOT JUST\nEVERYONE IN THIS ROOM, BUT SO MANY TENS OF MILLIONS OF\nAMERICANS, MR. PRESIDENT, NOT ONLY DO WE KNOW YOU ARE AN\nAMERICAN, YOU'RE A GREAT AMERICAN.\nAND YOU MAKE US ALL PROUD TO BE AMERICANS TOO.\nLET ME THANK THE CBC FOUNDATION FOR THIS GREAT HONOR AND TO\nTHANK ALL OF MY FRIENDS IN THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS FOR\nIT AS WELL. I DEDICATE IT TO ALL THE TRAIL\nBLAZERS WHO CAME BEFORE ME, THAT BLAZED TRAILS THAT I KOURLD\nFOLLOW IN THEIR FOOTSTEPS. SHIRLEY JORDAN, AND SANDY\nCHISHOLM, GENERATIONS OF WOMEN AND MEN WHO STRUGGLED AND\nSACRIFICED AND CLEARED A PATH FOR ALL OF US.\nTHIS AWARD IS ALSO FOR EVERYONE OUT THERE TO BREAK DOWN THE\nBARRIERS HOLDING AMERICANS BACK, TO LEADERS, LIKE ALL OF YOU AND\nTO A RISING GENERATION OF YOUNG ACTIVISTS, TO ALL THOSE ON THE\nFRONT LINES, DEDICATED TO THE PROPOSITION THAT IN AMERICA\nEVERY SINGLE CHILD DESERVES A CHANCE TO FULFILL HIS OR HER GOD\nGIVEN POTENTIAL. THIS HAS BEEN THE CAUSE OF MY\nLIFE. EVER SINCE I WENT TO WORK FOR\nTHE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND ALL THOSE YEARS AGO.\nAND I'M GOING DO CLOSE MY CAMPAIGN IN THE WAY THAT I BEGAN\nMY CAREER, AND THE WAY I BEGIN AS YOUR PRESIDENT, FOCUSED ON\nOPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUR CHILDREN AND FAIRNESS FOR OUR FAMILIES.\nWE HAVE SO MUCH WORK TO DO TOGETHER.\nI HAVE HEARD MANY HEART BREAKING STORIES, OVER THIS CAMPAIGN ONE\nFROM WAS A WORKING MOTHER FROM NORTHEAST PHILADELPHIA, SHE\nTESTIFIED AT THE DNC PLATFORM MEETING IN JUNE, AND TOLD US HOW\nHER HUSBAND HAD BEEN LAID OFF AND SHE WORKED IN A PART-TIME\nJOB. SHE SAID SHE HAD BEEN HUNGRY\nMORE TIMES THAN SHE COULD COUNT AND LIFE FELL LIKE A MAZE\nBECAUSE SHE FACED BARRIERS NO MATTER WHICH WAY SHE TURNED.\nBUT DESPITE ALL THIS, TIANA HAS HOPE, SHE STILL BELIEVES THAT\nHER 8-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER WILL BE PRESIDENT ONE DAY AND SHE\nBELIEVES THAT THIS ELECTION CAN MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE\nWORLD TO HER AND HER FAMILY. LET'S PROVE HER RIGHT.\nAS A COUNTRY, WE HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION TO GIVE HER FAMILY\nAND EVERY FAMILY A CHANCE TO RISE UP AND REACH THEIR DREAMS.\nTHAT IS WHAT'S AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION.\nIT'S NOT ABOUT GOLF COURSE PROMOTIONS OR BIRTH\nCERTIFICATES. IT COMES DOWN TO WHO WILL FIGHT\nFOR THE FORGOTTEN, WHO WILL INVEST IN OUR CHILDREN AND WHO\nWILL REALLY HAVE YOUR BACK IN THE WHITE HOUSE.\nWE NEED IDEAS, NONINSULTS. REAL PLANS TO HELP STRUGGLING\nAMERICANS IN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT AND LEFT BEHIND, NOT PREJUDICE AND\nPARANOIA. WE CANNOT LET BARACK OBAMA'S\nLEGACY FALL INTO THE HANDS OF SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T UNDERSTAND\nTHAT. WHOSE DANGEROUS AND DIVISIVE\nVISION FOR OUR COUNTRY WILL DRAG US BACKWARDS.\nINSTEAD WE NEED TO COME TOGETHER, TO GET INCOMES RISING\nWITH A HIGHER MINIMUM WAGE, WITH EFFORTS TO HELP THE COMMUNITY,\nTO GET GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF DANGEROUS PEOPLE, TO FIGHT FOR A\nCRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT ACTUALLY DELIVERS JUSTICE AND TO\nMAKE SURE THAT ALL KIDS HAVE GOOD SCHOOLINGS AND GOOD\nTEACHERS NO MATTER WHAT ZIP CODES THEY LIVE IN.\nWHEN YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT IT, THE CHOICE THIS MOVE IS ABOUT SO\nMUCH MORE THAN DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS.\nIT'S ABOUT WHO WILL HAVE THE POWER TO SHAPE OUR CHILDREN FOR\nTHE NEXT FOUR YEARS OF THEIR LIVES.\nIT'S ALSO ABOUT THE KIND OF COUNTRY WE WANT TO BE, WHAT WE\nWANT TO LEAVE BEHIND FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS.\nI THANK EVERYONE HERE, WHO HAS BEEN FIGHTING FOR THIS VISION\nOVER SO MANY YEARS. I'M WORKING EVERY SINGLE DAY TO\nEARN YOUR SUPPORT, AND I'M WORKING EVERY SINGLE DAY TO\nBRING OUR CAMPAIGN ACROSS THE FINISH LINE TOGETHER.\nBARBARA JORDAN FAMOUSLY SAID THAT A GOVERNMENT IS INVIGORATED\nWHEN PEACH OF US IS WILL BE TO PARTICIPATE IN SHAPING THE\nFUTURE OF THIS NATION. SO TO EVERYONE HERE TONIGHT, BUT\nALSO HELP TO REGISTER VOTERS, TELL OTHERS ABOUT THE CLEAR\nCHOICE IN THIS ELECTION, IN SOME STATES, EARLY VOTING IS NEARLY\nHERE, SO WE NEED TO KEEP THE PRESSURE ON, LET'S SEND A LOUD\nAND CLEAR MESSAGE ONCE AND FOR ALL.\nWE ARE SONGER TOGETHER.

BUT DON, IT IS SUCH AN\nINTERESTING MOMENT HERE IN TIME THAT THE PRESIDENT IS INDEED\nADDRESSING THIS. AT THE END OF THIS BIRTHER\nCONTROVERSY WHICH HAD BEEN PUT TO REST, BUT DONALD TRUMP\nMANAGED TO REVIVE IT YET AGAIN. AND THAT COULD FIRE UP THE\nCOMMITMENT IF DONALD TRUMP NEEDS TO BEAT HILLARY CLINTON.\n>> AND DONALD TRUMP GAVE A VERY SHORT STATEMENT SAYING YEAH,\nPRESIDENT OBAMA WAS BORN IN THE UNITED STATES.\nLET'S MOVE ON, LET'S MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.\nREALLY MEMBERS OF THE CBC, THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS, MANY\nOF THEM COMING OUT AND BLASTING DONALD TRUMP.\nDONALD TRUMP IS NOT GOING TO BE IN THAT ROOM TONIGHT.\nIT WOULD NOT BE A RECEPTIVE ROOM FOR HIM.\nBUT MANY SEE THIS AS YOU KNOW, A GIFT TO HILLARY CLINTON AS YOU\nSAID.

SO DON, I CAN TELL YOU TALKING\nTO PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM, AGAIN, A MOMENT OF CELEBRATION, BUT ALSO\nAN URGENT MOMENT TO GET DEMOCRATS AND OTHER VOTERS TO\nPAY ATTENTION TO THIS ELECTION. AS WE KNOW IT IS TIGHTENING IN\nBATTLEGROUND STATES AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY.\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS ENJOYED A LEAD COMING OUT OF THE\nCONVENTION. THAT HAS FALLEN A BIT.\nIT IS A VERY TIGHT RACE.

BUT DON, IT'S TRUE, THE\nCONSEQUENCES OF THIS ELECTION ARE STEEP.\nAND THAT IS WHAT THIS WHOLE TONE OF THIS DINNERS TONIGHT.\n>> DON'T GO ANYWHERE, I WANT TO CONTINUE TO DISCUSS WHAT IS\nHAPPENING IN THAT ROOM, THEN WE HAVE A LOT OF GUESTS THAT WE'RE\nGOING TO GET TO THIS EVENING. AS YOU SEE, THEY'RE STARTING UP.\nTHE PRESIDENT WILL SPEAK IN A SHORT TIME.\nALSO HILLARY CLINTON WILL SPEAK AS WELL.\nA RECIPIENT OF ONE OF THE AWARDS, IT IS BEING HOSTED BY\nTREVOR NOAH OF \"THE DAILY SHOW.\" YOU CAN SAY IT IS OF COURSE A\nSTAR-STUDDED AFFAIR WHEN IS COMES TO WASHINGTON AND\nESPECIALLY WITH THE CBC HERE. THE PHOENIX AWARDS HERE, THE\nHIGHEST HONOR FOR THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS.\nAND AMONG THE MANY ROLES OF THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS,\nWOMEN HAVE A HIGH ROLE AND A VERY STRONG AGENDA WITH THAT\nCAUCUS. HILLARY CLINTON IS VERY AWARE OF\nTHAT. THE PRESIDENT AS WELL.\nTHEY SEE THIS AS A GALVANIZING FORCE FOR HER IN THE UPCOMING 52\nDAYS LEFT. >> WITHOUT QUESTION, DON, THEY\nDO SEE THIS AS A KEY MOMENT. AND WE ARE SEEING THE MEMBERS OF\nCONGRESS BEING INTRODUCED RIGHT NOW.\nTHIS IS A STAR-STUDDED MOMENT FROM BOBBY RUSH AND OTHERS.\nHILLARY CLINTON MADE THE POINT YESTERDAY AND IN WASHINGTON, SHE\nSAID THAT AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN VOTE IN A HIGHER DEMOGRAPHIC\nPERCENTAGE THAN ANY OTHER DELEGATE IN THE ELECTORATE.\nAND SHE WAS CALLING ON THEM TO REALLY CONTROL THE HEEL OF\nHISTORY HERE. IT -- YOU KNOW, WE'VE SEEN\nPRESIDENT OBAMA ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\nMICHELLE OBAMA OUT IN VIRGINIA YESTERDAY.\nPERHAPS THE MOST FORCEFUL CAMPAIGNER INSIDE THIS PARTY OR\nANY POLITICAL PARTY HERE. SO IT IS VERY CRITICAL FOR\nSECRETARY CLINTON AND HER CAMPAIGN TO HAVE THIS SAME LEVEL\nOF SUPPORT FROM AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS AS PRESIDENT OBAMA DID.\nAND DON, I CAN TELL YOU I COVERED MANY DINNERS OF THE\nPRESIDENT'S EIGHT YEARS IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND EVEN BEFORE WHEN\nHE WAS A SENATOR FROM ILLINOIS. AND THERE IS A DEEP SENSE OF\nNOSTALGIA HERE WHEN HIS TERM COMES TO A CLOSE.\nBUT IT WILL NOT BE COMPLETED UNLESS HILLARY CLINTON IS\nELECTED. IT WILL NOT BE ALL FOR NAUGHT,\nBUT THESE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK FOUNDATION MEMBERS REALIZE AND\nKNOW THAT THEY HAVE WORK TO DO HERE TO CARRY ON THE PRESIDENT'S\nLEGACY AND ELECT HILLARY CLINTON.\n>> YOU'RE CORRECT, THIS IS ALSO ABOUT PRESIDENT OBAMA'S LEGACY.\nTHIS IS THE SEVENTH TIME THAT HE WILL SPEAK AT THIS ANNUAL\nDINNER. THIS IS THE 46th DINNER AND YOU\nCAN SEE PROMINENT MEMBERS UPON THE STAGE THERE.\nYOU CAN SEE CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER JOHN LOUIS.\n>> WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE ON HERE ON CNN AND DISCUSS WHAT IS\nHAPPENING HERE IN WASHINGTON, OF COURSE THIS IS COMING AT A VERY\nPIVOTAL TIME, THE ELECTION OF THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES JUST 52 DAYS AWAY. AFRICAN-AMERICANS, BLACK VOTERS\nIN THIS COUNTRY WILL PLAY A KEY PIVOTAL ROLE IN WHO BECOMES THE\nNEXT PRESIDENT. IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME, THAT IS\nWHY DONALD TRUMP IS REACHING OUT TO BLACK VOTERS BECAUSE HE KNOWS\nIT COULD TAKE HIM OVER THE TOP. THE PRESIDENT WILL ADDRESS THIS\nCROWD SHORTLY AND HILLARY CLINTON WILL ADDRESS THEM AS\nWELL, RIGHT AFTER A VERY QUICK BREAK.\nTA",

AND POLITICAL ANCHOR TIME WARNER\nCABLE NEWS AND CNN WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT JEFF ZELENY, WHO\nIS IN THAT ROOM IN WASHINGTON, D.C.\nSO LET'S TALK TO THE PANEL NOW. WHAT IS PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA\nLIKELY TO DO TONIGHT? WILL THE GLOVES COME OFF?\n>> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY, HE WILL TAKE OFF THE GLOVES.\nBUT I ALSO FEEL AS IF YOU KNOW, HE WILL DEFEND HIS OWN LEGACY.\nSO I THINK THERE IS TWO SEPARATE MISSIONS.\nYOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS IN HIS FIRST\nTERM HE WAS WIDELY CRITIQUED BY MEMBERS OF THE CONGRESSIONAL\nBLACK CAUCUS FOR NOT SPEAKING DIRECTLY ENOUGH TO\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN CONCERNS. AND THAT IS PARTLY BECAUSE THERE\nIS SORT OF A GAME OF KEEP-AWAY IN POLITICS.\nBECAUSE IF YOU DEAL WITH CONCERNS, YOU ARE SEEN BEING TOO\nSPECIFIC AND NOT BEING IN THE INTEREST OF ALL AMERICANS.\nSO HE IS GOING TO DO THAT. DEFEND HIS LEGACY.\nHE IS IN A GOOD PLACE WITH BLACK VOTERS RIGHT NOW.\nBUT SECRETARY CLINTON IS NOT, SHE IS SHOWING WEAKNESS AMONG\nBLACK VOTERS, WHO ARE 30% LESS LIKELY TO SUPPORT HER THAN OLDER\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS. SO HE IS GOING TO MAKE THAT\nCASE. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT.\nI WAS DISCUSSING IT WITH THE PASTOR THE OTHER DAY.\nIT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE THE PASTOR WAS SAYING YOUNG PEOPLE\nDON'T HAVE THE EXPERIENCE THAT OLDER PEOPLE HAVE.\nTHEY DIDN'T GO THROUGH THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT.\nTHE STRUGGLE FOR THEM WAS DIFFERENT.\nTHE STRUGGLE FOR THEM WAS THEY COULDN'T EVEN GO TO THE SAME\nRULES. MY MOTHER RECENTLY SAID WHAT DID\nWE GET CATTLE PRODDED FOR AND TEAR GASSED FOR IS TO HAVE TO\nDEAL WITH THIS CRAZY ELECTION CYCLE, YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T KNOW\nWHAT IS GOING ON. >> SHE IS RIGHT, YOU DON'T EVEN\nHAVE TO DO IT IN A BROAD GENERATIONAL SENSE, THE REALITY\nIS, PEOPLE IN THEIR YOUNG 20s, THIS IS THE ONLY PRESIDENT THEY\nREMEMBER, BARACK OBAMA. IT WILL BE PROBABLY WRITTEN\nABOUT, THAT A LOT OF THE \"BLACK LIVES MATTER\" MOVEMENT, AND MY\nLE -- MILLENIALS, WHAT THEY'RE\nTHINKING ABOUT, IS THIS SORT OF HISTORICAL MOVE, IS THE\nEXCEPTION NOT THE RULE. YOU STEP OUTSIDE THE UNIVERSITY\nYOU START TO SEE THINGS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY.\nIT'S NOT SUCH A KIND WORLD OUT THERE.\nTHE PEOPLE WHO ELECTED BARACK OBAMA NOT NECESSARILY THE PEOPLE\nWHO SHOW UP ON THE POLICE FORCE IN THEIR TOWN.\n>> NOT A SHOCK, BUT ESPECIALLY TO THE PEOPLE ON THE STAGE.\nTHE PEOPLE ON THE STAGE WERE THE REASON THERE COULD BE A BARACK\nOBAMA, OR YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE REASONS THAT ALL OF US CAN SIT\nHERE ON THE STAGE INCLUDING YOU, JULIAN, BECAUSE YOU FOUGHT FOR\nCIVIL RIGHTS FOR EVERYONE. IT'S SURPRISING THAT IT'S A\nSHOCK TO YOUNG PEOPLE, THEY THINK THAT THE WORLD WAS YOU\nKNOW AS IT IS, BARACK OBAMA AS A BLACK PRESIDENT HAS ALWAYS BEEN\nPOSSIBLE? >> WELL, LOOK, YOU HAVE TWO\nNARRATIVES, ONE WAS THE NARRATIVE STARTING IN 2008.\nTHE TRANSFORMATION IN AMERICAN HISTORY.\nBUT THEN YOU HAVE HAD WHAT HAPPENED.\nYOU HAD THE RESISTENCE TO BARACK OBAMA, YOU HAVE HAD THE RACISM\nAND EVERYTHING FROM THE ISSUES TO POLICING TO VOTING RIGHTS\nFRONT AND CENTER, ALL CULMINATING WITH DONALD TRUMP\nAND SOME OF THE SUPPORT HE RECEIVED FROM NATIONALIST GROUPS\nAND I THINK THAT IS WHAT IS ON THE MIND OF MANY YOUNG VOTERS.\n>> SO IN THE VEIN OF WHAT IS GOING ON NOW, WE LOOK AT THE\nPICTURES OF THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS.\nTHEIR GOAL, I'M SURE IS TO GET HILLARY CLINTON ELECTED.\nSO THAT IN THAT VEIN AND ESPECIALLY NEEDING THE\nENTHUSIASM OF YOUNG VOTERS AND BEYOND, HOW DO YOU GET THEM ON\nBO BOARD, JASON?\n>> SO NOW IT'S THE REVERSE. IT'S OLDER BLACK PEOPLE SAYING\nLOOK, WE KNOW WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE TO LIVE UNDER PRESIDENT\nTRUMP. IT'S TIME FOR BLACK BOOMERS AND\nBLACK SENIORS TO TALK TO YOUNG PEOPLE AND SAY LOOK, I KNOW\nYOU'RE NOT IN LOVE WITH THE LADY BUT YOU NEED TO GET ACTIVE AND\nGET INVOLVED AND WE'VE COME FULL CIRCLE.\nTHAT IS WHAT THE CAUCUS HAS DONE, SAYING LOOK, YOUR VOTE FOR\nJILL, THAT WOULD BE A PROBLEM. >> AND ON THE OTHER SIDE AS WE\nPAY ATTENTION TO THIS, ON THE OTHER SIDE THE TALK HAS BEEN AND\nTHE STRATEGY HAS BEEN TO SAY THAT MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE UP ON\nTHE STAGE, THE DEMOCRATS, THEY HAVEN'T FOUGHT FOR YOU.\nTHEY'RE NOT LOOKING OUT FOR YOUR BEST INTERESTS.\nTHEY JUST WANT YOUR VOTE. THEY HAVE NOT DONE ANYTHING FOR\nYOU FINANCIALLY OR POLITICALLY WHEN IT COMES TO CRIMINAL\nJUSTICE AND SOCIAL JUSTICE AND BEYOND AND THAT IS HOW THEY'RE\nLOOKING TO CAPTURE THE VOTE. >> AND DONALD TRUMP MADE THAT\nEXACT ARGUMENT JUST A MONTH OR SO AGO IN MICHIGAN WHEN HE\nADDRESSED THE AUDIENCE OF BLACK VOTERS AND HE SAID WHAT THE HELL\nDO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? I'M TOLD THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA IS\nGOING TO ADDRESS THAT DIRECTLY, ADDRESS THAT PESSIMISM DIRECTLY.\nWE'VE HEARD HILLARY CLINTON DO SORT OF A LITANY OF WHAT THE\nVOTERS HAVE TO LOSE. BUT WE'RE TOLD THAT PRESIDENT\nOBAMA WILL DO THAT TONIGHT. IT'S INTERESTING, PRESIDENT\nOBAMA HAS BEEN TRYING TO REACH OUT TO SOME AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nVOTERS, HE WAS IN FLINT, MICHIGAN THIS WEEK.\nTHE TRIP DIDN'T GO SO WELL FOR HIM.\nBUT YESTERDAY, THE BIRTHER COMMENT HE MADE SORT OF\nINTERRUPTED THAT PROGRESSIVE HE MADE ANY AT ALL.\nSO INDEED, DONALD TRUMP WILL NOT BE IN THE ROOM BUT WILL BE\nPRESENT HERE IN AN UNDERLYING REMARK, ADDRESSING THAT \", WHAT\nTHE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE\"? PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL TELL PEOPLE\nWHAT THEY HAVE TO LOSE IF THEY VOTE TO DONALD TRUMP.\n>> SO JEFF, WILL IT BE A MIX OF POLITICAL AND SENTIMENTAL?\nOR WILL IT LEAN IN A COMBINATION OF BOTH?\n>> I THINK ALMOST ALL POLITICAL, DON, I'M TOLD BY A SENIOR\nADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL THAT THIS WILL BE LARGELY ALMOST\nENTIRELY A POLITICAL SPEECH. THE PRESIDENT OF COURSE IS\nSENTIMENTAL IN THE FINAL MONTHS BUT TOLD HIS ADVISERS THERE IS A\nLOT OF WORK TO BE DONE. IN FACT, HIS WORK WILL NOT BE\nCOMPLETE IF HE IS REPLACED IN THE WHITE HOUSE BY DONALD TRUMP.\nTHAT WILL ERASE A LOT OF HIS LEGACY.\nSO NOT AS MUCH TIME FOR SENTIMENT AT THIS POINT AS THERE\nIS FOR POLITICS AND AN ARGUMENT FOR WHY HE BELIEVES HILLARY\nCLINTON SHOULD BE HIS SUCCESSOR IN THE WHITE HOUSE.\nAND SHE WILL ALSO BE SPEAKING HERE TONIGHT.\nDON, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THEY WILL APPEAR ON STAGE TOGETHER.\nSHE WILL SPEAK BEFORE HIM ACCEPTING THAT AWARD AS YOU\nSAID. AND THEN HE WILL SPEAK AFTER\nHER. AGAIN, GIVING SOMEWHAT OF A CALL\nTO ACTION TO THESE AFRICAN-AMERICAN LEADERS.\nAS WELL AS OTHERS LISTENING ACROSS THE COUNTRY.\n>> ALL RIGHT, JEFF, JEFF IS INSIDE THE ROOM, THERE IS TREVOR\nNOAH, AND THEY WILL BE HOSTING TONIGHT.\nTHEY WILL BE HOSTING THIS EVENING.\nAND WE WILL SEE MANY -- THAT IS KELLY ROWLAND, MANY PROMINENT\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS ON THAT STAGE TONIGHT.\nAND OF COURSE MANY ICONIC MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, AND THE\nPIONEERS OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS, MANY WHO HAVE GOTTEN US\nTO WHERE WE ARE TONIGHT. MANY HAVE SO MANY PRIVILEGES\nTHEY DID NOT HAVE. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS BEING\nA LEGACY FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA. THIS IS ABOUT LEGACY, BECAUSE\nDONALD TRUMP HAS SAID THAT HE WANTS TO DISMANTLE OBAMACARE.\n>> ONE FAANALYSIS OF DONALD TRU WAS THAT 21 MILLION AMERICANS\nWOULD BECOME UNINSURED BECAUSE OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PLAN.\nSO IT'S A ROLLBACK OF ACCESS. AND I THINK A LOT OF TIMES\nPEOPLE -- DONALD TRUMP, THERE IS A REASON THAT HE IS STILL\nCOMPETING VERY STRONGLY WITH SECRETARY CLINTON.\nIT'S NOT A FLUKE. HE IS A REALLY POWERFUL ORATOR\nIN HIS OWN STYLE. BUT ONCE YOU START TO BREAK DOWN\nHIS OWN POLICIES I WROTE A PIECE OF HOW AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE\nSOMETIMES CALLED A CAPTURED GROUP IN POLITICS, BECAUSE MOST\nDON'T SEE ANYTHING THEY WANT ON THE GOP SIDE, BUT THEY ARE NOT\nBEING OFFERED WHAT THEY WANT IN A TWO-PARTY SYSTEM.\nSO AN ANALYSIS WAS DONE OF THIS CAPTURED GROUPS AND THIS IS A\nREAL PROBLEM FOR ALL AMERICANS I WOULD ARGUE, NOT JUST BLACK\nAMERICANS. >> IT HAS BEEN SAID FOR A WHILE\nTHAT SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT DEMOCRATS TAKE\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS' VOTE FOR GRANTED.\nAND THAT DONALD TRUMP, THE REPUBLICANS MAY HAVE A POINT\nWHEN IT COMES TO THAT. BUT THE QUESTION HAS BEEN LATELY\nIF YOU TALK TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, THEY WILL SAY YEAH,\nEVERY PARTY SHOULD HAVE TO FIGHT FOR YOUR VOTE.\nBUT IS DONALD TRUMP THE ONE AT THIS POINT IN TIME.\nTHAT IS THE ISSUE. >> YEAH, I MEAN, I THINK PART OF\nTHE POINT OF THE SPEECH I'M SURE IS TO SUGGEST THAT EVEN IF THIS\nIS THE CASE THERE ARE DIFFERENCES.\nTHERE ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE PARTIES.\nIF YOU LOOK AT THE ISSUE LIKE VOTING RIGHTS DEMOCRATS AND\nREPUBLICANS HAVE PRETTY MUCH WIN ON DIFFERENT SIDES OF THIS\nDEBATE. AND I THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA\nWANTS TO REMIND VOTERS OF THAT. AND I THINK THE THIRD PARTY\nISSUE IS VERY MUCH ON THEIR MIND.\nTHEY DO NOT WANT TO START TO LOSE VOTES TO A THIRD PARTY\nTHROUGH A PROTEST THAT GIVE YOU DONALD TRUMP AND THE GOP.\n>> AS WE WAIT FOR THE PRESIDENT TO SPEAK AND HILLARY CLINTON TO\nGET THIS AWARD. LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING YOU\nSAID. YOU SAID THE PRESIDENT IS A\nGREAT ORATOR AND A GREAT SEARCH. SO LET'S TALK WITH COSMETICS,\nAND YOU GUYS REMEMBER KENNEDY, NIXON, IF YOU LISTEN TO IT ON\nTHE RADIO, NIXON WON, IF YOU SAW IT ON TELEVISION, KENNEDY WON.\nI'M JUST TALKING ABOUT THE REACTION FROM THE AUDIENCE AND\nPEOPLE I SPEAK TO. THERE IS A CLEAR DISTINCTION\nBETWEEN PRESIDENT OBAMA WHO IS VERY COMFORTABLE WHO SORT OF\nLEANS INTO THE PODIUM, AND TALKS, AND IS LIKE COME ON,\nY'ALL, AND THEN THERE IS THE CLOSER WHO IS A GREAT SPEAKER.\nAND HILLARY CLINTON WHO ADMITS I'M NOT A GREAT SPEAKER OR\nCANDIDATE, CERTAINLY NOT HER HUSBAND, BILL CLINTON.\nHOW DOES SHE CAPTURE THAT? DOES SHE NEED TO LOOSEN UP?\nIS THERE SOMETHING SHE NEEDS TO DO TO PULL IN THOSE YOUNG VOTERS\nTHAT IS BEYOND POLICY. THAT IS BEYOND CRIMINAL JUSTICE\nREFORM? >> SHE HAS TO BE HERSELF.\nTHIS IS -- >> DOES SHE COME OFF AS HERSELF?\n>> NO, THAT IS THE PROBLEM. EVERYTHING HILLARY CLINTON DOES\nSEEMS SO FORCED AND SCRIPTED. THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO WAS\nEXTREMELY POPULAR AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT, WHO GALVANIZED WOMEN\nIN THE '90s AND SHE WAS A PROGRESSIVE WOMAN WHO SAID I\nDON'T HAVE TIME TO MAKE COOKIES. >> SHE NEEDS MORE SWAG.\n>> WHEN PEOPLE SAY SHE IS NOT BEING HERSELF, WE HAVE TO\nREMEMBER HER DAYS WITH THE DEFENSE FUND, AND HER DAYS IN\nARKANSAS. ONE OF THE THINGS WHEN I WAS ON\nTHE CAMPAIGN TRAIL IN 2008, ONE OF THE SPECIAL MOMENTS WAS BEING\nIN MEMPHIS. AND WATCHING HER GO THROUGH THE\nCIVIL RIGHTS MUSEUM AROUND THE SITE OF THE ASSASSINATION AT THE\nMOTEL. AND SHE WAS RELIVING MEMORIES.\nSHE WAS NOT JUST KIND OF PASSING THROUGH SHAKING HANDS AND MAKING\nA PERFUNCTORY POLITICAL STATEMENT.\nTHIS IS HER LIFE, WHAT SHE CHOSE TO DO WITH HER LIFE, IF SHE\nREMINDS PEOPLE OF THAT THAT SAYS A LOT.\n>> AND WHAT IS GOING TO GET HER THERE AND HELP HER WITH SOME\nVOTERS, EVERY LITTLE BIT COUNTS IN THIS CONTAIN.\n>> AND THEY TALKED ABOUT HOW TO ATTRACT THESE VERY AM ABUSIVE\nL -- WITH YOUNG BLACK VOTERS UNDERSTAND,\nONE OF THE BIG DIVIDES IS OVER WHETHER OR NOT SHE REALLY STANDS\nFOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. >> OKAY, I HAVE TO TAKE A BREAK,\nYOU'RE SOME VERY SMART PEOPLE. I'M ENJOYING THIS CONVERSATION,\nSO MAKE SURE YOU STAY WITH US AT HOME BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE A\nVERY IMPORTANT NIGHT, HILLARY CLINTON LOOKING AT PICTURES FROM\nTHE BLACK CAUCUS FOUNDATION. AGAIN, PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL\nADDRESS THIS EVENT IN JUST MOMENTS.\nFOR NOW, HILLARY CLINTON BEING HONORED WITH THIS INAUGURAL\nTRAIL BLAZER AWARD. OUR LIVE COVERAGE RIGHT AFTER\nTHIS.",

RANGEL WAS DOING A\nRALLYING CRY FOR THAT AWARD, FOR THAT ACCEPTANCE SPEECH.\nAS YOU SAW THE MEMBERS WERE JUST INTRODUCED AND WENT BACK STAGE.\nTHEY'RE ALL STILL BACK STAGE RIGHT NOW WAITING TO SHAKE HANDS\nAND TAKE THEIR ANNUAL PICTURE WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA, THIS YEAR,\nOF COURSE, THE SPOUSES ALWAYS JOINED IN.\nAND THERE WILL BE A CHIEF OF STAFFS GROUP PICTURE WITH THE\nPRESIDENT. THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW.\nTHEY'RE WAITING FOR THOSE PHOTOS, DON.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE CONVERSATION, I KNOW THERE HAS\nBEEN BEHIND THE SCENES CONVERSATION, WE DISCUSSED IT.\nI HAD THE REPRESENTATIVE GREG MEEKS, BOTH MEMBERS OF THE\nCAUCUS ON MY SHOW LAST NIGHT. THEY BOTH SPOKE OUT ABOUT THIS\nCRUCIAL TIME FOR THIS COUNTRY, WHAT ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE\nATTENDING SAYING ABOUT THAT? >> WELL, THIS HAS BEEN ABOUT\nCELEBRATING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FINAL SPEECH TO THE CAUCUS,\nWHERE HE WAS ONCE A MEMBER, RIGHT?\nSO THERE HAS NOT BEEN A WHOLE LOT OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP. HE DOESN'T GET TO CONTROL\nEVERYTHING, HE CAN RUN PRESS BUT IS NOT CONTROLLING THIS VERY\nSPECIAL MOMENT. THIS IS THE 46th ANNUAL\nLEGISLATIVE LEGISLATIVE CONFERENCE.\nIT'S A BIG DEAL ALSO, A FUNDRAISER, FOR THOSE WHO SEE ME\nON CNBC, THEY WATCH YOU AND ARE GLAD THAT THEY ARE FACT-CHECKING\nFOR ALL THE LIES THAT DONALD TRUMP TELLS.\nI HAVE SEEN SOME OF HIS SURROGATES AROUND, OF COURSE\nTHERE WAS AN EVENT THAT DONALD TRUMP HELD, THE BLACK OUTREACH\nEVENT AROUND HERE THIS WEEK. I HEARD THERE WERE ONLY 50\nPEOPLE ATTENDING, IF THAT. THIS IS A CROWD THAT IS NOT VERY\nRECEPTIVE TO DONALD TRUMP. AND I WOULD SAY PERHAPS THEY ARE\nBIPARTISAN. BUT THESE ARE MAINSTREAM KIND OF\nREPUBLICANS AND HE DOESN'T HAVE AN AUDIENCE AT ALL.\n>> SO THAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY, THE OUTREACH YOU SAY THAT\nHAPPENED. BUT ALSO WHAT HAPPENED\nYESTERDAY, DONALD TRUMP FINALLY ADMITTED THAT PRESIDENT O-- AT\nLEAST IN HIS MIND, THAT PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA WAS BORN\nIN THE UNITED STATES. SOMETHING EVERYBODY KNEW.\nHERE IS THE MOMENT AND THEN WE'LL DISCUSS.\n>> HILLARY CLINTON AND HER CAMPAIGN OF 2008 STARTED THE\nBIRTHER CONTROVERSY. I FINISHED IT.\nI CONTINUE TIN FINISHED IT. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA WAS BORN IN THE UNITED STATES.\nPERIOD. NOW, WE ALL WANT TO GET BACK OH\nMAKING AMERICA STRONG AND GREAT AGAIN.\n>> HERE IS HILLARY CLINTON'S RESPONSE TO DONALD TRUMP.\n>> FOR FIVE YEARS HE HAS LED THE BIRTHER MOVEMENT.\nTO DE-LEGITIMATIZE OUR FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT.\nHIS CAMPAIGN WAS FOUNDED ON THIS OUTRAGEOUS LIE.\nTHERE IS NO ERASING IT IN HISTORY.\nBARACK OBAMA WAS BORN IN AMERICA, PLAIN AND SIMPLE.\nAND DONALD TRUMP OWES HIM AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AN APOLOGY.\n>> DONALD TRUMP STARTED OFF HIS STATEMENT BY FALSELY SAYING THAT\nHILLARY CLINTON STARTED THE BIRTHER MOVEMENT.\nHILLARY CLINTON RESPONDING SAYING HE NEEDS TO APOLOGIZE.\nHE DID NOT GO THAT FAR. I KNOW YOU SAID TONIGHT IT'S A\nCELEBRATION, BUT AS THEY TALK, DO YOU THINK THEY THINK THAT\nDONALD TRUMP OWED THE PEOPLE AND BARACK OBAMA AN APOLOGY.\n>> AND PEOPLE THINK THEY OWED HIM AN APOLOGY WHEN HE FIRST GOT\nON THIS BIRTHER TRAIN. DONALD TRUMP, WHEN HE REALLY\nBELIEVES SOMETHING, DON, WE KNOW HE TWEETS S ABOUT IT.\nHE IS NOT SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT APOLOGIZING TO THE PRESIDENT.\nWHAT IS REALLY INTERESTING IS YOU SAW HE WAS READING THAT\nPARTICULAR SPEECH. I THINK IT WAS TREMENDOUSLY\nDISRESPECTFUL AND SOME OF THE CBC MEMBERS THOUGHT HE CHOSE TO,\nYESTERDAY, DURING AGAIN, THIS 46th ANNUAL LEGISLATIVE\nCONFERENCE OF THIS CBC FOUNDATION.\nOF COURSE WE KNOW HE WENT ON A TOUR IN D.C., AND STILL NOT AT\nTHIS CONFERENCE. SO I THINK THAT IS ALSO VERY\nINTERESTING THIS TERMS OF TIMING.\nTHE MEMBERS THINK IT IS DISRESPECTFUL, OF COURSE,\nBECAUSE BARACK OBAMA WAS ONCE A CBC MEMBER, AND THIS IS THEIR\nANNUAL LEGISLATIVE CONFERENCE. THE MESSAGE IS VERY CLEAR AND\nONE THEY DON'T TAKE KINDLY TO. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT VOTER\nENTHUSIASM. THERE HAS BEEN AN ISSUE\nCONCERNING THAT WHEN IT COMES TO HILLARY CLINTON.\nDEMOCRATS ARE CONCERNED. HER CAMPAIGN IS CONCERNED AS\nWELL. THE FIRST LADY WAS OUT YESTERDAY\nTRYING TO YOU KNOW GET VOTERS ENTHUSED.\nGET SOME ENTHUSIASM FROM AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS.\nTAKE A LISTEN. >> IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO JUST COME\nTO A RALLY. IT ISN'T.\nIT'S NOT ENOUGH TO JUST GET A FEW SELFIES.\nIT'S NOT ENOUGH TO JUST GET ANGRY.\nAND JUST SPEAK OUT. WE ALSO HAVE TO WORK AND MAKE\nTHAT CHANGE AND TAKE ACTION. AND THAT STARTS WITH ELECTING\nFOLKS WHO WILL STAND WITH YOU AND FIGHT WITH YOU.\nAND THAT IS WHY YOU NEED TO GET YOURSELF AND EVERYONE YOU KNOW\nREGISTERED TO VOTE TODAY. >> SO THIS IS YESTERDAY, ANGELA,\nWITH CNN, JUST THE BEGINNING SORT OF THE UNITED FRONT OF THE\nOBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND THE HILLARY CLINTON YOU KNOW FOLKS\nCAMPAIGN. THIS IS A UNITED FRONT.\nWILL THE FIRST LADY -- THE CURRENT VICE PRESIDENT, THE\nSITTING PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, DO YOU THINK THAT WILL\nMAKE A DIFFERENCE IN VOTER ENTHUSIASM, ESPECIALLY AMONG\nBLACK FOLK? >> WELL, IF YOU LOOK AT THE\nAPPROVAL RATING IT'S TELLING NOT JUST FOR BLACK VOTERS BUT ALSO\nVOTERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY WHO MAY NOT BE DECIDED.\nYOUNGER VOTERS, WOMEN VOTERS, WE KNOW THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS\nMAKING A BIG PUSH FOR MILLENNIAL VOTERS.\nSHE CERTAINLY NEEDS THE HELP. WE ALSO SAW THIS IS NOT MICHELLE\nOBAMA'S FIRST TRIP TO THE RODEO. SHE ALSO MADE AN AMAZING SPEECH\nAT THE DNC ALSO VERY HELPFUL TO HILLARY CLINTON, MAKING IT CLEAR\nWHERE HER ALLEGIANCE LIES AND WHERE SHE WILL CAMPAIGN OVER THE\nNEXT FEW MONTHS. SO WE'RE STARTING TO SEE HER GET\nOUT ON THE TRAIL. AND SHE IS SOMEBODY WHO ALSO HAS\nVERY HIGH APPROVAL RATINGS AND VERY WELL LOVED IN THIS COUNTRY.\nSO IT'S REALLY GOOD TIMING, IN PART ALSO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU\nSAW THAT SN'S COVER, BARACK OBAMA AND FIRST LADY ON IT.\nSO THOSE IN THE COMMUNITY THINK IT WILL BE VERY, VERY HELPFUL IF\nYOU LOOK AT THE APPROVAL RATINGS.\n>> SHE CERTAINLY DOES GET HIGH MARKS AMONG THE MILLENNIALS,\nTHANK YOU VERY MUCH, ANGELA. SOMETIMES IT'S DIFFERENT IN THE\nROOM THAN WHAT YOU SEE ON TELEVISION.\nWE APPRECIATE IT. >> YOU GOT IT.\n>> MAKE SURE YOU STAY TUNED TO THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS\nDINNER, PRESIDENT OBAMA TAKING THE PODIUM IN JUST MOMENTS.\nDONALD TRUMP INVITED OR WOULD HAVE BEEN WELCOME.\nHE DECIDED TO SKIP IT. WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT, WHY,\nAFTER A VERY QUICK BREAK.",

I WANT TO BRING IN SIMONE\nSANDERS, A PRESS SECRETARY FOR THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN.\nAND ALSO THE DIRECTOR OF THE DIVERSITY COALITION FOR DONALD\nTRUMP. A LITTLE BIT OF CONFUSION HERE,\nSOME OF THE CAUCUS MEMBERS SAID THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS INVITED TO\nSPEAK TONIGHT, BUT BRUCE, WAS HE IVITED TONIGHT AND IF SO WHY\nDID HE DECIDE NOT TO? >> I DON'T KNOW, DON, I CAN'T\nSPEAK FOR THE CAMPAIGN, HOWEVER, I'VE BEEN BUSY RUNNING THE\nLARGEST DIVERSITY CAMPAIGN IN HISTORY, SO I DON'T KNOW, TO\nANSWER THAT. >> DO YOU THINK HE SHOULD HAVE\nGONE? BECAUSE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN\nWELCOME. >> I DON'T KNOW IF HE WAS\nINVITED. THERE IS A LOT OF TIMES, ALL YOU\nHAVE TO DO IS INVITE MR. TRUMP. IT'S NOT SO MUCH THAT HE DOESN'T\nWANT TO ATTEND, BUT INVITE HIM. >> BUT IF YOU ARE THE HEAD OF\nTHE COALITION, WOULDN'T YOU WANT YOUR CANDIDATE AT AN EVENT THIS\nBIG AND IS SO IMPORTANT TO VOTERS, TO PEOPLE OF COLOR?\n>> I AM -- HEAD OF THE LARGEST NATIONAL DIVERSITY, MEANING WE\nREPRESENT KOREAN-AMERICANS FOR TRUMP, AFRICAN-AMERICANS FOR\nTRUMP, HISPANIC/AMERICANS FOR TRUMP, WHICH YOU CAN GO ON LINE\nAND CLICK ON WHO WE ARE. WE REPRESENT ALL DIFFERENT SORTS\nOF FACETS, ESPECIALLY THE MINORITY BASES ACROSS THE\nCOUNTRY. OUR WEB IS BIGGER, WE'RE NOT\nJUST ONE SMALL GROUP. WE'RE A LARGER GROUP OF\nAMERICANS. >> THE LARGER GROUP OF AMERICANS\nTHAT YOU'RE SPEAKING OF ARE MADE UP OF SMALLER GROUPS.\nAND THIS IS A BIG GROUP OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS, BIG ENOUGH\nAND POWERFUL ENOUGH TO BE CARRIED ON CNN AND IN COUNTRIES\nAROUND THE WORLD. YOUR CANDIDATE IS NOT THERE.\nTHAT IS MY QUESTIONI INGQUESTIO >> WELL, YEAH, I DO NOT DO THE\nSCHEDULING, I RUN THE DIVERSITY CAMPAIGN FOR TRUMP.\nIT IS A GREAT EVENT. DON, I WANT TO MAKE ONE POINT IF\nI MIGHT ADD. I HAD TIME TO REALLY WATCH\nYESTERDAY AND KIND OF DIGEST AND SLEEP ON IT AND WATCH THE PRESS\nCONFERENCE THAT THE CBC HAD. YOU KNOW, I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A\nPRESS CONFERENCE FOR NDC TRUMP, AND BRING ALL THE CULTURES TO\nTHE FRONT AND HAVE PEOPLE SEE THE ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS FOR\nDONALD TRUMP. IT KIND OF HURT WHEN EVERY\nPERSON HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK THE ONLY THING THAT CAME OUT WAS\nHATE, RACISTS, FRAUD, ALL OF THESE THINGS.\nIF I WERE A VOTER IN MY DISTRICT AND MY CONGRESSWOMAN OR MAN WENT\nUP THERE TO WIN, I WOULD BE WANTING THEM TO FIGHT FOR YOU\nKNOW, REAL POLICIES AND ISSUES THAT RELATES TO TRYING TO HELP\nOUR HPCU COLLEGES GET BIGGER AND STRONGER, YOU KNOW, FIGHT TO\nBRING A COMPANY IN OUR DISTRICT FOR JOBS, NOT SIT UP THERE AND\nSAY HATEFUL RACIST COMMENTS. >> I GET YOUR POINTS.\nI WANT TO GET SIMONE IN, SHE NEEDS TIME TO SPEAK.\n>> SO DON, WHAT I WANT TO SAY IN RESPONSE.\nTO POSSIBLY RESPECTFULLY FOR THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES. THAT IS NOT REALLY -- FAIR FOR\nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE, FOR THEM TO SAY THAT.\n>> OKAY, WE GET YOUR POINT. GO AHEAD.\n>> SO DON, I THINK TO KIND OF HELP BRUCE UNDERSTAND WHY THE\nCBC MEMBER AFTER MEMBER GOT UP IN THAT PRESS CONFERENCE\nYESTERDAY AND SAY WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, WHEN\nTHE DREDD-SCOTT DECISION HAPPENED, IT SAID AN\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN, WHETHER SHE WAS A FREE BLACK PERSON OR\nSOMEONE THAT WAS YOU KNOW RECENTLY ENSLAVED OR WHAT NOT,\nWAS NOT A CITIZEN, AND THAT IS WHY WE HAD\nSO WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE LIKE DONALD TRUMP AND MANY FOLKS THAT\nCARRIED THE CONSPIRACY OF THE BIRTHER MOVEMENT BRINGING THAT\nUP THAT'S OPENING UP AN OLD WOUND, AN OLD WOUND THAT SAYS\nBLACK PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY AREN'T CITIZENS, THAT QUESTIONS\nIF WE BELONG HERE. SO THAT'S WHY THOSE CBC MEMBERS\nGOT UP THERE AND SAID THAT. ONE HAS TO WONDER, DID DONALD\nTRUMP BELIEVE WHAT HE WAS SAYING?\nAND CBC MEMBERS RESPONDED TO THAT.\nOR WAS HE PLAYING ON THE FEELINGS OF VOTERS, SOME PEOPLE\nIN THE REPUBLICAN BASE AND SOME PEOPLE IN HIS OWN BASE, AND HE\nKNEW THIS WOULD GET THEM RILED UP AND PROPEL HIM TO WHERE HE IS\nRIGHT NOW. >> IT WAS ALSO THE TONE, BRUCE,\nOF HIS COMMENTS YESTERDAY ON BIRTHER.\nTHE BREVITY OF THOSE COMMENTS. AND ALSO FOR COMMENTS LIKE THIS\nONE. PLAY THIS OF DONALD TRUMP,\nPLEASE. >> IT IS TIME FOR A CHANGE.\nWHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE BY TRYING SOMETHING NEW?\nI WILL FIX IT. WATCH.\nI WILL FIX IT. YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE.\nNOTHING TO LOSE. >> SOME OF THOSE WHAT DO YOU\nHAVE TO LOSE HAS BEEN YOUR SCHOOLS ARE FAILING, YOUR\nNEIGHBORHOODS ARE UNSAFE, YOU DON'T HAVE JOBS, SORT OF CASTING\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS IN A ROLE AS BEING ALWAYS THE VICTIMS OF\nCRIME, UNEMPLOYED, UNEDUCATED. MANY AFRICAN-AMERICANS FOUND\nFAULT IN THAT AND MANY OF THOSE AFRICAN-AMERICANS WERE CBC\nMEMBERS AND THEY WERE VOICING THAT CONCERN YESTERDAY.\n>> WELL, I DISAGREE. THAT IS ONLY APPLICABLE, DON --\nAND YOU KNOW, WE HAVE SITUATIONS IN A LOT OF OUR CITIES ACROSS\nTHE COUNTRY, DETROIT, YOU KNOW, LOS ANGELES, HERE IN ATLANTA, A\nLOT OF PLACES BUT YOU KNOW, IN ALL DUE RESPECT, IN MOST OF THE\nCITIES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE UNDER THE SAME OLD DEMOCRAT\nREGIME. SO THE QUESTION IS DO YOU WANT\nTO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT? DO YOU WANT TO HAVE AN\nOPPORTUNITY TO BRING SCHOOL CHOICE IN TO SOME OF THESE\nSCHOOLS AND NOT SAY, WELL, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS MANDATED\nTHAT YOU HAVE TO GO HERE, TO GIVE A BLACK CHILD AN\nOPPORTUNITY TO GET A VOUCHER AND LET THAT MOM AND DAD CHOOSE\nANOTHER SCHOOL? THESE POLICIES HAVE BEEN\nFAILING, THOUGH, DON. THIS IS NOT A BROAD BRUSH\nAROUND -- REMEMBER, I'M A BLACK PERSON TOO.\n>> YEAH. WE CAN SEE THAT.\nBUT HERE'S THE THING. >> WE KNOW.\n>> THE ISSUE IS -- >> I KNOW, RIGHT?\n>> THE QUESTION -- AND THERE ARE PEOPLE -- THAT'S NOT ME\nLAUGHING. THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE\nROOM. BUT HERE'S THE THING.\nPEOPLE SEE THE CAMPAIGN AND NOT JUST THE CANDIDATE AS TONE DEAF.\nTHEY'RE SAYING, LISTEN, SOME OF THAT MAY BE IMPORTANT, YEAH,\nSCHOOL CHOICE MAY BE IMPORTANT, MAYBE IT WILL HELP OUT, BUT YOUR\nCANDIDATE AND YOUR CAMPAIGN IS TONE DEAF WHEN IT COMES TO\nSPEAKING WITH AND TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND NOT AT\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS AND NOT INSULTING THEM BY YOUR LANGUAGE.\nSYMONE, AM I WRONG WITH THAT? >> NO, I THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY\nRIGHT. AND I'D ALSO ADD IF MR. TRUMP\nWOULD LIKE TO COME AND MAKE THAT CASE TO AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS\nTHEN HE HAS HAD MANY OPPORTUNITIES.\nHE'S MISSING ONE RIGHT NOW. MAYBE NOT AT THIS DINNER, BUT\nALL THIS WEEK HE WAS IN D.C. A COUPLE DAYS AGO.\nHE COULD HAVE SPOKE TO MEMBERS OF THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK\nCAUCUS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE ATTENDING THE CONGRESSIONAL\nBLACK CAUCUS FOUNDATION ANNUAL LEGISLATIVE CONFERENCE.\nI THINK VOTERS REALLY DO HAVE QUESTIONS IF DONALD TRUMP IS\nACTUALLY SINCERE IN HIS OUTREACH BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE OPPORTUNITY\nIT SEEMS THAT HE'S HAD TO ADDRESS AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS\nHE'S EITHER DECLINED, BEEN BUSY, OR JUST YOU KNOW, COULDN'T BE\nBOTHERED WITH AN INVITATION. >> MM-HMM.\nBRUCE? >> WELL, THIS IS WHAT I DO KNOW.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS OUTCAMPAIGNED HILLARY CLINTON 2-1.\nHIS RALLIES COMMAND 20,000 TO 40,000 PEOPLE MINIMUM AT HIS\nVENUES FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.\nHE TAKES THE ENTIRE NEWS -- WE'RE AVERAGING 20-PLUS MILLION\nPLUS VIEWERS EVERY TIME. THE WORD IS GETTING OUT, GUYS.\nIT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR FROM ALL OVER THE\nCOUNTRY DON'T SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.\nSO THAT'S AN UNFAIR STATEMENT TO SAY DONALD TRUMP'S MESSAGE IS\nNOT GETTING OUT TO BLACK COMMUNITIES --\n>> NO, WHAT I SAID -- I WANT TO BE CLEAR, BRUCE.\nWHAT I SAID IS DONALD TRUMP IS NOT GOING TO AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nVOTERS TO SPEAK TO THEM. AND I'D ALSO NOTE AS SOMEONE WHO\nWAS A STAFFER ON THE BERNIE SANDERS CAMPAIGN, WHERE WE\nGARNERED THE MOST PEOPLE IN ATTENDANCE OF ANY PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATE THEN OR NOW, THAT RALLY ATTENDANCE IS NOT AN\nINDICATION OF IF YOU'RE WINNING OR IF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO COME\nOUT TO THE POLLS AND SUPPORT YOU.\n>> WELL, IT ALSO -- IN THOSE RALLIES, TOO, HE'S ALSO MADE A\nCONCERTED EFFORT OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS TO REACH OUT\nSPECIFICALLY TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS TO GET HIM\nOVER THAT THRESHOLD THAT HE NEEDS FOR ELECTORAL VOTES IN\nTHIS COUNTRY.

THEY WERE CRITICAL.\nAND OF COURSE THEY WERE SO IMPORTANT IN BOTH OF PRESIDENT\nOBAMA'S ELECTIONS. SO SHE IS CALLING ON THEM.\nAND DON, THIS IS AN EXAMPLE.

IT APPEARS THE DEVICE WAS TIMED\nAND SOMEHOW MADE TO GO OFF WHEN RUNNERS WERE SUPPOSED TO GO\nPAST. RIGHT NOW, I DON'T THINK\nOFFICIALS KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT THE DEVICE.\nTHEY HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT IT. I THINK THEY HAVE X-RAYED IT\nWHICH IS WHAT THE BOMB SQUAD DOES.\nSOME INFORMATION HAS BEEN SHARED WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT.\nTHE INITIAL APPEARANCE WAS THAT IT WAS MULTIPLE DEVICE HOOKED\nTOGETHER SOMEHOW. NON HOW THEY WERE HOOKED\nTOGETHER, BUT WIRED TOGETHER OR TAPED TOGETHER, I'M NOT SURE.\nAT FIRST APPEARANCE, IT LOOKED LIKE MULTIPLE DEVICES PUT\nTOGETHER PROBABLY SO THEY WERE MORE POWER YOU FEEL AND ONLY ONE\nDEVICE WENT OFF. OFFICIALS WENT BACK AND LOOKED\nAT PIECES OF THE DEVICE. WE MAY HEAR ABOUT IT LATER.\nINITIALLY, THE THINKING WAS, YEAH, IT WAS THREE DEVICES OR\nTWO DEVICES TAPED TOGETHER, WIRED TOGETHER AND THEY EACH GO\nOFF AROUND THE TIME THAT RUNNERS WERE SUPPOSED TO PASS THE AREA.\nIT'S REALLY LUCK. I MEAN, IT'S AMAZING.\nPEOPLE -- THE REASON WHY THE RACE STARTED LATE IS SO MANY\nPEOPLE SIGNED UP AND THEY COULDN'T GET PEOPLE IN PLACE IN\nTIME. YOU KNOW, PERHAPS SHEER LUCK\nHERE AND, YOU KNOW, WE PROBABLY WOULD BE DEALING WITH A\nDIFFERENT SITUATION HAD THE RACE STARTED ON TIME.\n>> ALL RIGHT. THANK GOODNESS.\nNO ONE WAS INJURED. NONETHELESS EXTREMELY FRIGHTEN.\nSIMON THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT REPORT.\nWE'LL HAVE MORE STRAIGHT AHEAD AFTER THIS.",

ADD ONE MORE THING, FACT THEIR\nCALLING IT A TERRORISM CASE WITH THE FBI THIS CHARGE MEANS TO BE\nDOMESTIC TERRORISM. COULD BE SOMEBODY WITH A\nGRIEVANCE AGAINST THE U.S. MILITARY, POSSIBLY THE MARINE\nCORPS SPECIFICALLY AND HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH OVERSEAS\nINSPIRED ATTACK LIKE ISIS. SO IT STILL COULD BE TERRORISM\nWITHOUT BEING INTERNATIONAL, AL QAEDA OR ISIS OR OTHER\nAFFILIATED GROUP. >> GOOD POINT.\nSUSPECT STILL AT LARGE AS SHIMON P\nPOE WAS REPORTING.\nWHAT DID THEY LEAVE BEHIND, SURVEILLANCE SHOW, FAIRLY\nPOPULATED NEIGHBORHOOD. WHAT ARE THEY DOING TO TRACK\nDOWN THE SUSPECT? >> ANALYZING THE VIDEOS,\nDETERMINE HOW MANY THEY HAVE, GET PEOPLE TOGETHER TO REVIEW\nTHE MATERIAL AND LOOK AT INTERSECTION CAMERAS THROUGHOUT\nTHE SURROUNDING AREA, MAYBE A CAR WENT THROUGH A RED LIGHT OR\nSOMETHING TRYING TO GET AWAY IN A HURRY THAT MIGHT HAVE A LEAD\nFOR THEM. THERE'S A LOT OF JUST NORMAL\nINVESTIGATIVE WORK THAT GOES INTO THIS, UNFORTUNATELY PIPE\nBOMBS ARE NOT THAT SOPHISTICATED.\nTHERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE THAT SKILL SET.\nYOU CAN OBTAIN EVERYTHING THAT YOU NEED AT A LOCAL SUPPLY STORE\nPOSSIBLY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF BLACK POWDER THAT THEY'RE USING\nBUT YOU COULD GET THAT AT OTHER PLACES AS WELL.\nTHE MATERIALS WOULD BE READILY AVAILABLE AND THE INFORMATION ON\nTHE INTERNET WOULD ALSO BE AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE TO FIGURE\nOUT HOW TO PUT IT TOGETHER IF THEY DIDN'T ALREADY KNOW.\nTHERE'S A LOT OF MATERIAL FOR THEM TO GO THROUGH AND THEY'LL\nTAKE TIME TO ANALYZE WHAT THEY HAVE AND TRY TO COLLECT AS MUCH\nINFORMATION AS THEY CAN. >> TOM FUENTES, THANK YOU SO\nMUCH.

THE REASON WHY RUNNERS AND\nNOBODY, THANKFULLY, WAS HURT, WAS BECAUSE THE RACE WAS DELAYED\nTHIS MORNING, DUE TO LONG REGISTRATION LINES.\nTHERE WERE LONG REGISTRATION LINES AT THE TIME.\nA SINGLE-FILE LINE. RUNNERS SAID THAT AT THE TIME,\nAROUND 9:30, POLICE OR THE INTERCOM TOLD THEM THAT THEY\nFOUND A SUSPICIOUS BAG BY THE START AND FINISH LINE.\nTHAT CAUSED SOME -- A LITTLE BIT OF CHAOS, AND PEOPLE WERE\nLOOKING AT IT.

UNCLEAR WHAT HAPPENED.\nI AM NOT SMELLING SMOKE, I AM NOT SEEING A LOT OF PANIC.\nI HAVE SEEN ONE INJURED PERSON ON THE SCENE RIGHT NOW.\nTHERE ARE DOZENS AND THAT IS A VERY CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE,\nMAYBE THERE IS 100 OFFICERS HERE, FROM THE FIRE DEPARTMENT,\nFROM THE POLICE, I'M SEEING A FEW MEMBERS IN UNIFORM OF THE\nNATIONAL GUARD, THEY'RE PUSHING ME BACK AS I'M TALKING TO YOU\nRIGHT NOW. THERE ARE HELICOPTERS IN THE\nAREA, 24th STREET, HOWEVER, IS STILL MOVING, PEOPLE ARE\nWATCHING, PEOPLE ARE TALKING ON THEIR PHONES.\nTHE OFFICERS FROM THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, FROM THE POLICE\nDEPARTMENT, ASIDE FROM CLEARING A PERIMETER DO NOT SEEM TO BE IN\nA PANIC, THERE'S NO BLOODY INJURED PEOPLE HERE.\nTHERE'S NO STAMPEDE. THE POLICE TOLD ME I HAD TO GET\nBACK BECAUSE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF EXPLOSIONS.\nI DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ORIGIN WAS, I DON'T KNOW THE EXTENT OF\nTHE DAMAGE, I JUST KNOW THERE'S A VERY MASSIVE, POLICE, FIRE\nDEPARTMENT, EVEN SOME NATIONAL GUARD PRESENCE HERE, BUT IT DOES\nSEEM TO BE A CALM SITUATION ASIDE FROM THE MASS SECURITY\nPRESENCE. >> RICHARD, JUST FOR OUR\nAUDIENCE THAT IS JUST JOINING US AND LOOKING AT WHAT WE HAVE ON\nSCREEN.

ARE ANY OF THEM GIVING YOU ANY\nFIRST PERSON ACCOUNTS OF WHO MAY HAVE ACTUALLY HEARD THIS\nEXPLOSION? >> PEOPLE ARE TALKING.\nI'M NOT SURE HOW ACCURATE THEIR INFORMATION IS.\nPEOPLE DID MENTION A IED, AN IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE DEVICE IN A\nDUMPSTER. PEOPLE ARE ON THEIR PHONES.\nI SAW PEOPLE IN A BAR ON 23rd STREET, HUDDLED BY THE\nTELEVISION SET. THEY ARE ACTIVELY TRYING TO FIND\nOUT INFORMATION. LET ME GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THIS\nNEIGHBORHOOD. CHELSEA, ON A SATURDAY NIGHT, IS\nONE OF THE MOST POPULAR DISTRICTS IN MANHATTAN, ONE OF\nTHE MOST ACTIVE NIGHTLIFE AREAS IN THIS TOWN.\n23rd STREET IS THE MAIN THOROUGHFARE THAT CUTS THROUGH\nCHELSEA AND WEST CHELSEA, THE STREET IS FULL OF BARS AND\nRESTAURANTS AND IT WAS VERY CROWDED, IT'S VERY CROWDED RIGHT\nNOW. # THEY HAVE JUST SET UP POLICE\nTAPE, THE POLICE LINE DO NOT CROSS AREA, BETWEEN 24th AND\nBEYOND. I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH FURTHER IT\nGOES BEYOND 23rd STREET, I'M ON 24th STREET RIGHT NOW.\nYOU CAN PROBABLY SEE SOME OF THE HELICOPTERS.\nI HEARD FROM PEOPLE TALKING, THAT THERE WAS SOME SORT OF IED\nIN A DUMPSTER, I DID SEE ONE INJURED PERSON WHO WAS TAKEN\nAWAY IN A STRETCHER. HIS CONDITION SEEMED MODERATE, I\nWOULD SAY HE LOOKED LIKE HE WAS BEING TREATED FOR SHOCK.\nHE WAS NOT BLEEDING, HE WAS CONSCIOUS, SO I WOULD CLASSIFY THAT AS A VERY LIGHT OR MINOR\nINJURY. TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE MOOD\nHERE, I'M LOOKING AT THREE UNIFORMED OFFICERS FROM THE\nNATIONAL GUARD, THEY ARE LOOKING AT THEIR CELL PHONES, APPARENTLY\nTRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING ON.\nTHERE ARE FIRE DEPARTMENT PERSON NELL, LOOKING UP AT THE\nHELICOPTERS THAT ARE SHINING THEIR SPOTLIGHTS DOWN, THEY'RE\nSHINING THEIR SPOT LIGHTS DOWN RIGHT NOW AT A BUILDING, BETWEEN\n23rd AND 24th ON 7th AVENUE.

FOR A MOMENT WHERE\nPRESIDENT OBAMA AT THE MOMENT IS ADDRESSING THE CONGRESSIONAL\nBLACK CAUCUS'S ANNUAL LEGISLATIVE CONGRESS.\n>> UNDER THE WIRE, WE GOT THAT RESOLVED.\nTHAT'S A BOOST FOR ME IN THE  IN OTHER BREAKING NEWS, THE\nWORLD IS ROUND NOT FLAT. LORD, THIS IS OF COURSE MY LAST\nCBC DENVER AS PRESIDENT.  NEXT TIME I SHOW UP, I HAVE TO\nBUY A TICKET. NOW, DON'T GET ME WRONG, WE HAVE\nGOT SO MUCH WORK TO DO, AND WE ARE SPRINGING ALL THE WAY\nTHROUGH THE TAPE, BUT THE DAYS ARE WINDING DOWN.\nI NOTICE WHENEVER MICHELLE OR I TRAVEL AROUND THE COUNTRY, FOLKS\nGO UP AND SAY, WE'RE SO SAD TO SEE YOU GO.\nAND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. AND MICHELLE SAYS, THAT'S RIGHT.\nSHE GAVE A SPEECH YESTERDAY, A BUNCH OF YOUNG PEOPLE WERE\nCHANTING FOUR MORE YEARS, AND SHE SAID NOPE, NOPE, NOPE.\nSHE'S READY. BUT WE DO WANT TO TAKE THIS\nOPPORTUNITY JUST TO SAY THANK YOU, TO SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR\nSUPPORT OVER THE YEARS. TO SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR\nFRIENDSHIP, TO SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRAYERS, AS I JUST LOOK\nACROSS THIS AUTD FOR YUM, THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE HERE WHO\nLIFTED US UP. WHEN WE BEGAN THIS JOURNEY ABOUT\n10 YEARS NOW, IT WASN'T ABOUT ME, IT WASN'T ABOUT MICHELLE, IT\nWASN'T JUST TO BE A BLACK PRESIDENT OR THE PRESIDENT OF\nBLACK AMERICA, WE UNDERSTOOD THE POWER OF THE SYMBOL.\nWE KNOW WHAT IT MEANS FOR A GENERATION OF CHILDREN OF ALL\nRACES TO SEE FOLKS LIKE US IN THE WHITE HOUSE.\nAND AS MICHELLE SAID, WE HAVE TRIED TO BE ROLE MODELS, NOT\nJUST FOR OUR OWN GIRLS, BUT FOR ALL CHILDREN, BECAUSE WE KNOW\nTHEY WATCH EVERYTHING WE DO AS ADULTS, THEY LOOK TO US AS AN\nEXAMPLE. SO WE HAVE TAKE ON THAT\nRESPONSIBILITY SERIOUSLY. AND I'M SO BLESSED TO HAVE A\nWIFE AND A PARTNER ON THIS JOURNEY WHO MAKES IT LOOKS SO\nEASY. AND IS SO STRONG AND SO HONEST\nAND SO BEAUTIFUL. AND SO SMART.\nBUT WE'RE ALL, WE'RE JUST THANKFUL, BECAUSE YOU GUYS HAVE\nLIFTED US UP EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.\nNOW WE KNOW HOWEVER, THAT WHAT MATTERS MOST FOR OUR COMMUNITY\nIS NOT JUST THE SYMBOL, NOT JUST HAVING AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nPRESIDENT. IT'S HAVING A PRESIDENT WHO'S\nGOING TO DO HIS OR HER DARNEDEST TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS.\nAND FIGHT THE RIGHT FIGHTS.

NO OUTDOOR CAVES OR TYPICAL\nTARGETS OF THE TERRORISM WE SEE IN EUROPE.\nWAS THAT CLOSE ENOUGH TO A SUBWAY ENTRANCE THAT THAT COULD\nHAVE BEEN A THEORETICAL TARGET? >> Reporter: SURE.\nYOU'VE GOT SUBWAYS AT 23rd AND 7th AND 23rd AND 6th.\nTHIS WAS RIGHT IN BETWEEN. YOU KNOW, IT'S EVEN SOMEWHAT\nDARK. IT'S A STREET OF EXPRESS BUSES\nTHAT WERE JUST PUT IN. IT'S A STREET WHERE THERE'S NOT\nAS MANY PEOPLE WALKING OR SITTING AT CAFES.\nIT'S A STREET WHERE YOU COULD HIDE SOMETHING.\nTHE PROBLEM FOR PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD ALREADY IS THAT\nTHERE'S SO MUCH CONSTRUCTION GOING ON THAT BUSINESSES ARE\nGOING OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE OF  THE ISSUE OF WHETHER MAXIMUM\nDAMAGE WAS MEANT, IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A CRIME OF OPPORTUNITY.\nALTHOUGH, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAS TAKEN PLACE.\nRIGHT NOW, THE STREET IS COMPLETELY CLOSED OFF.\nGOVERNOR CUOMO WALKED THROUGH AND THE MAYOR WERE OUTSIDE\nSTARBUCKS.

THEY SAID, YOU KNOW, THE\nBUILDINGS SHOOK, THE BUILDINGS AROUND IT.\nPEOPLE ARE NOT ALLOWED REALLY TO GO IN AND OUT VERY MUCH RIGHT\nNOW. IT'S STILL A MAJOR CRIME SCENE.\nBUT I DO THINK IT'S CRITICAL -- >> WE ARE -- WE ARE OUT OF TIME.\nWE ARE UP AGAINST THE CLOCK. AMY GOODMAN, THANK YOU FOR THAT\nREPORT FROM DEMOCRACY NOW.

WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.\nLOOKED LIKE IT MAY BE MULTIPLE INJURIES.\nTHE POLICE HAVE CLOSED DOWN SEVENTH AVENUE AT 34th STREET.\nSO THERE'S NO FURTHER TRAFFIC GOING SOUTHBOUND.\nTHEY'RE CLOSING THE TRAFFIC-GOING EAST FROM THE WEST\nSIDE AND FROM WEST TO THE EAST SIDE.\nSO THEY'RE BASICALLY TRYING TO SOLIDIFY THAT BLOCK, THAT AREA\nAT 23RD AND 6. THEY SET UP A TEMPORARY COMMAND\nPOST SO TO SPEAK IN A BUILDING DOWN THE BLOCK.\nWE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT.\n>> WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT A DEVICE THAT EXPLODED.\nWE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT WAS PLANTED.\nTHIS IS NOT LIKE, NOT A FURNACE, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN ACTUAL\nIMPROVISED IMPROVISED TO BE EXPLODED.\nIT DID EXPLODE YOU SAY THERE ARE REPORTS RIGHT NOW AND WE'RE\nLOOKING RIGHT NOW AT THE SCREEN OF WHAT I UNDERSTAND WAS A\nDUMPSTER? >> YEAH.\nTHAT'S WHAT I'M SEEING TOO. SOME KIND OF DUMPSTER, GARBAGE\nDUMPSTER. >> YOU KNOW, JEANINE, THE THING\nTHAT BOTHERS ME ABOUT THIS, TODAY IN NEW JERSEY AND SOUTH\nJERSEY, DOWN THE SHORE, THEY HAD A 5K RUN WITH THE MARINE CORPS,\nAND SOMEBODY PLACED AN IED IN SOME KIND OF GARBAGE CAN, AND --\n>> THAT WAS IN SEASIDE PARK, NEW JERSEY.\n>> SEASIDE HEIGHTS, RIGHT. AND NOW YOU HAVE THIS THING IN\nMANHATTAN. WHICH IS JUST I DON'T KNOW KIND\nOF CURIOUS TO ME AS TO WHAT'S GOING ON.\n>> WELL, YOU KNOW, THE JERSEY SHORE AND THEN YOU'VE GOT THIS\nAREA IN MANHATTAN, AND LET ME JUST SAY IS THAT THE AREA IN\nCHELSEA AVENUE IS UNLIKE MOST IN MANHATTAN FOR THOSE NOT FROM NEW\nYORK CITY. VERY, VERY POPULATED.\nYOU KNOW, BIG APARTMENT BUILDINGS THERE, THERE ARE A LOT\nOF PEOPLE. BUT IF IT'S IN THE DUMPSTER\nTHERE, IF IT WAS PLACED THERE, AND THAT DUMPSTER -- THE TRUNK\nTO THAT SIDE, IT MUST HAVE BEEN A HUGE EXPLOSION.\nAND THE PEOPLE THAT WERE INJURED, DO WE KNOW WERE THEY\nPEOPLE WALKING ON THE STREET, WERE THEY PEOPLE IN THE\nBUILDING? DO WE KNOW HOW INJURED THEY ARE?\nDO WE KNOW WHAT TIME THIS HAPPENED?\n>> NO REPORTS AS OF YET. HONESTLY, IT ONLY HAPPENED ABOUT\nI DON'T KNOW, 20, 25 MINUTES AGO.\nI GOT CALLS FROM THE SCENE FROM PEOPLE THAT LIVE NEXT TO THAT\nBUILDING. TWO MINUTES AFTER IT HAPPENED.\nSO YOU PROBABLY 20, 25 MINUTES AGO.\n>> YOU KNOW, BERNIE, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, MY DAUGHTER LIVES IN\nTHAT BUILDING. AS SOON AS I HEARD, I CALLED.\nWHICH IS KIND OF FRIGHTENING. BUT SHE'S OKAY.\nAND NOT THERE. BUT YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU TALK\nABOUT WHAT HAPPENED ON THE JERSEY SHORE TODAY, THERE WAS\nSOMETHING IN A -- NOT IN A DUMPSTER, BUT WHAT WAS IS IT IN?\nA TRASH CAN OF SOME SORT ON THE --\n>> IT WAS IN THE GARBAGE CAN THAT WAS RIGHT THERE IN THE AREA\nWHERE THE RACE WAS SUPPOSED TO BEGIN.\n>> RIGHT. >> AND I'M LOOKING AT THE FBI'S\nNOTIFICATION, ALL SEASIDE PARK RESIDENTS CAN RETURN TO THEIR\nHOMES NOW. THE AREA'S BEEN CLEARED.\nYOU KNOW, IT'S -- IT'S JUST KIND OF CURIOUS TO ME.\nTHESE TWO THINGS HAPPENING IN THE SAME DAY, WITHIN HOURS\nREALLY, WITHIN 10, 12 HOUR PERIOD.\n>> BERNIE, YOU AND I KNOW BOTH KNOW, THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS\nCOINCIDENCE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. BUT WITH THIS KIND OF EXPLOSION\nAND CERTAINLY WE'LL LEARN SOON ENOUGH WITH ALL OF THE AGENCIES\nTHAT I'M SURE ARE INVOLVED, YOU KNOW HOW MUCH OR HOW BIG -- NOT\nJUST THE EXPLOSION, BUT WHAT WAS USED AND WHAT KIND OF DEVICE WAS\nUSED WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS KIND OF IMPROVISED DEVICE,\nAND WHETHER OR NOT ON THE STREETS, BERNIE, DO YOU KNOW\nWHETHER OR NOT THERE'D BE CAMERAS ON THE STREET CORNERS\nTHERE? >> LISTEN THESE GUYS, YOU KNOW,\nI DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT SPECIFIC CORNER, BUT IN MANHATTAN, YOU\nKNOW, IT'S PRETTY MUCH MIDTOWN IS PRETTY MUCH COVERED ALL OVER.\nAND YOU KNOW, AS YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY'S INTERESTED IN\nSECURITY THESE DAYS. AND A LOT OF THOSE BUILDINGS\nHAVE OUTSIDE CAMERAS. THEY HAVE INTERNAL CAMERAS.\nTHERE ARE STREET CAMERAS. I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF THE\nPOLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE FBI -- I'M SURE JOINT TERROR TASK FORCE\nWILL TAKE THE LEAD ON THIS AT SOME POINT.\nI'M PRETTY CONFIDENT THEY'LL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT.\nAND I THINK IT'LL BE A PART OF THAT.\n>> WE'RE GETTING WORD NOW THAT FDNY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT THAT\nTHERE ARE UP TO 15 INJURIES THAT WE'RE AWARE OF.\nWEIR NOT AWARE OF THIS THE SEVERITY OF THE",

I'M JOINED ON THE PHONE RIGHT\nNOW BY FORMER NYPD DETECTIVE THOMAS RUSKIN AND WE ARE\nAWAITING THE FOX NEWS REPORTING ABOUT TO BE ON THE SCENE.\nDETECTIVE, WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON\nTHERE? >> WELL, SHORTLY AFTER 8:00\nTONIGHT, IT APPEARS THAT SOME KIND OF EXPLOSION OCCURRED IN\nFRONT OF THE ASSOCIATE HOUSING FOR THE BLIND IN A DUMPSTER\nWHICH YOU'VE BEEN SHOWING IN THE LAST SEGMENT WITH COMMISSIONER\nKERIK. AND AT THIS POINT IN TIME, THEY\nDON'T NOSE WHAT CAUSED THE EXPLOSION, OTHER THAN IT APPEARS\nTO BE SOME KIND OF DEVICE THAT WAS PUT INTO THAT DUMPSTER.\nFOR WHAT YOU'RE SHOWING OR WHAT YOU'VE SHOWN, IT APPEARS TO BE A\nPRETTY LARGE DEVICE TO MANGE THAT WILL DUMPSTER AS BERNIE\nELUDED TO. THAT'S NOT AN EASY THING TO\nMANGEL TO THE WAY THAT THAT TWITTER FEED IS SHOWING YOU.\nAND IT APPEARS THAT THEY'VE PULLED FIRE DEPARTMENTS SLIGHTLY\nOUT OF THE AREA BECAUSE THERE'S NO RISK OF FIRE AT THIS POINT IN\nTIME TO ALLOW THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE BOMB SQUADS\nTO APPROPRIATELY ASSESS THE AREA FOR A POSSIBLE SECONDARY DEVICE.\n>> WHEN YOU SAY POSSIBLE SECONDARY DEVICE, WHAT DO YOU\nMEAN BY THAT? >> WELL, WE KNOW THAT IN PAST\nATTACKS, PEOPLE HAVE PUT A SECONDARY DEVICE IN THE AREA SO\nTHAT IF THEY'RE LOOKING TO HURT PEOPLE AND MANGEL PEOPLE OTHER\nTHAN THE PEOPLE THAT THEY DID WITH THE ORIGINAL DEVICE, THEY\nLOOK TO POTENTIALLY HURT FIRST RESPONDERS.\nSO A SECONDARY DEVICE COULD GO OFF LIKE YEARS AGO IN THE BOSTON\nMARATHON BOMBING BY PEOPLE RESPONDING TO THE AREA TO TRY\nAND HELP THE INJURED. MOST OF THE TIME FIRST\nRESPONDERS. >> AND YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE\nTHINGS THAT WE'RE FINDING OUT NOW AND RARELY ARE THE FACTS\nREALLY PERFECTLY CORRECT IN THE BEGINNING, BUT WE HEAR THERE ARE\nUP TO 15 PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN INJURED AND WE'RE NOT AWARE OF\nTHE SEVERITY OF THE INJURIES, BUT DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA OR HAVE\nYOU HEARD ANYTHING MORE ABOUT THAT?\n>> I HAVE HEARD WHAT'S BEEN REPORTED FROM THE ABOUT 15 ITs\nTO 23, BUT AS WE KNOW FROM OTHER INCIDENT WAS THIS NATURE.\nPEOPLE HAVE A TENDENCY TO BRING THEMSELVES TO THE HOSPITAL.\nSO PEOPLE WHO ARE NECESSARILY AT THE SCENE AREN'T MAYBE THE ONLY\nPEOPLE WHO ARE INJURED. OTHER PEOPLE MAY WALK INTO\nHOSPITALS LIKE BELLVUE AND OTHER HOSPITALS IN THE AREA AND\nSELF-ADMIT THEMSELVES. SO THE 15 INJURIES MAY JUST BE\nFROM THE SCENE. >> RIGHT.\nDO WE HAVE ANY IDEA WHETHER OR NOT WITH THIS EXPLOSION WAS --\nIS THERE BROKEN GLASS IN THE GLASS COME OUT OF THE APARTMENT\nBUILDINGS? WERE THERE ACCIDENTS THERE WITH\nTHE EXPLOSION? WHAT ACCOMPANIED THIS LARGE\nEXPLOSION IF YOU KNOW? >> WELL, I DON'T KNOW FIRSTHAND,\nBUT FROM MY EXPERIENCE WHEN YOU HAVE AN EXPLOSION OF THIS\nNATURE, AND YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THE CHARS AND SOME OF THE DEBRIS\nFROM THAT CONTAINER THAT YOU'RE SHOWING ON THE SCREEN, YOU KNOW,\nIT'S POSSIBLE THE DIFFERENT FACADES COULD HAVE BEEN DAMAGED\nFROM IT, WINDOWS PROBABLY WERE BROWN OUT, NOT TO MENTION THINGS\nON THE STREET. CARS PARKED ALONG THE STREET OR\nCRUISING THE STREET COULD HAVE ALSO HAD DAMAGE TO THEM.\n>> RIGHT. AND WE REALLY DON'T KNOW THE\nLOCATION EXACTLY OF WHERE THAT DUMPSTER WAS IN REGISTRATION TO\nTHE BUILDING ITSELF. I MEAN, WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT\nSIXTH AND 23RD IS A VERY WELL-TRAFFICKED AREA.\nAND THERE CERTAINLY WOULD NOT BE A DUMPSTER THERE.\nI MEAN I'M QUITE FAMILIAR WITH THE LOCATION.\nSO I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHERE EXACTLY THAT DUMPSTER WAS THAT\nMIGHT HAVE BEEN RIGHT BEHIND THE  >> I HEARD IT WAS IN FRONT OF\n135 WEST 23RD STREET, WHICH IS THE ASSOCIATED HOUSING FOR THE\nBLIND. SO I DON'T KNOW IF IT HAD ANY\nRELATIONSHIP TO THAT BUILDING IF IT'S BEEN PUT ON THERE BUT\nTHAT'S WHERE THE HOUSING FOR THE BLIND IS.\n>> RIGHT. >> I DON'T KNOW IF IT HAD\nANYTHING TO DO WITH IT. I DO KNOW THIS, I KNOW THE\nSUBWAY SERVICE SL PASSING 23RD STREET IS OPERATING, BUT PASSING\n23RD STREET AND ALL VEHICULAR TRAFFIC AND PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC\nIS STOPPED IN THE AREA. >> WE'VE GOT FOX NEWS REPORTER\nBRIAN LEANIS IS ON THE SCENE, BRIAN, ARE YOU THERE?\n>> Reporter: YES, JUDGE, WE HEAR YOU.\nI AM ON THE SCENE. WE JUST ARRIVED ABOUT TEN\nMINUTES AGO. THIS IS WHAT WE KNOW.\nTHE FDNY TELLS ME THAT THERE ARE 25 INJURED.\nTWO CIVILIANS THAT WERE ACTUALLY ON THE STREET.\nI DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT MEANS 23 OTHER PEOPLE BUT WHAT WE KNOW\nRIGHT NOW IS THAT 25 CIVILIANS -- 25 PEOPLE ARE\nINJURED DUE TO THIS EXPLOSION. WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT RIGHT\nNOW IS 24 BETWEEN 24th AND 23RD. YOU'VE GOT THE FDNY RIGHT NOW.\nTHEY HAD THEIR GEAR ON. SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE TAKING IT\nOFF. THEY HAVE ABOUT TWO OR THREE\nFIRE DEPARTMENT TRUCKS AS YOU CAN SEE.\nTHEY WERE APPARENTLY LOOKING AT WHAT LOOKED LIKE A DUMPSTER\nHERE, I DON'T KNOW, THIS IS NOT WHERE THE EXPLOSION HAPPENED.\nTHE FDNY TELLS ME THAT THE EXPLOSION TOOK PLACE ON 23RD AND\nSIXTH AVENUE. I HAVE AN EYEWITNESS HERE WITH\nME. IF YOU CAN COME OVER HERE.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH. WHAT WAS YOUR NAME AGAIN?\n>> MY NAME SL SOLIE, CAN YOU TELL OUR VIEWERS EXACTLY WHAT\nYOU SAW. YOU WERE ON A BUS, YOU HAD JUST\nGOTTEN OFF A BUS. AND THEN THIS HAPPENED.\nEXPLAIN EVERYTHING FROM START TO FINISH.\n>> I JUST GOT OFF THE CROSS TOWN 23RD, 23 BUS ON SEVENTH AVENUE.\nI WENT IN TO GET A BACK STABLE. I CAME OUT, AND I HEARD BOOM,\nBOOM, AND EVERYTHING STARTED SHAKING.\nAND THERE WAS BIG MOUNDS OF SMOKE, AND PEOPLE STARTED\nRUNNING. AND I STARTED RUNNING WITH THEM.\nDOWN SEVENTH AVENUE. AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.\n>> ANYBODY INJURED AROUND YOU? WHAT DID YOU SEE IN TERMS OF A\nBIG PLUMES OF SMOKE. >> PEOPLE FRANTIC.\nPEOPLE WERE FRANTIC AND THEY WERE JUST RUNNING, RUNNING, AND\nPEOPLE ON THIS STREET, 24th STREET CAME RUNNING OUT OF THEIR\nAPARTMENTS, BECAUSE IT SHOOK THEM IN THEIR APARTMENTS.\nAND SOME PEOPLE WERE AT THEIR JOBS.\n>> EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE HOW LOUD THIS WAS.\n>> IT SOUNDED LIKE -- THE FIRE WORKS, BUT A THOUSAND TIMES\nSTRONGER AND IT SHOOK EVERYTHING.\nIT WAS BOOM, BOOM, LIKE, LIKE, LIKE IF I WAS IN IRAQ AND A BOMB\nDROPPED. THAT'S WHAT IT SOUNDED LIKE.\n>> SO YOU WALK, YOU WALK OUT OF THE CONVENIENCE STORE AT THAT\nMOMENT -- >> ON 23RD.\n>> AND YOU LOOK TO YOUR LEFT, WHICH IS TOWARDS SIXTH AVENUE.\n>> YES. AND IT WAS JUST BIG MOUNDS OF\nSMOKE. AND I JUST GOTTEN OFF THE BUS.\nI WAS WALKING UP THAT BLOCK. GOD IT GOOD.\nI JUST GOT OFF THE BUS. AND I WAS COMING UP FROM SIXTH\nAVENUE. AND I JUMPED ON THE BUS.\n>> Reporter: YOU SAID YOUR EARS WERE RINGING --\n>> MY LEFT SERE STILL VERY FOGGY.\nAND IT'S, IT'S HITTING ME NOW. BUT PEOPLE WERE PANICKING.\nTHEY WERE RUNNING ALL THE WAY DOWN THE STREET.\n>> Reporter: DID YOU SEE ANY INJURIES?\nANYBODY -- >> Reporter: I DIDN'T SEE\nANYBODY INJURED. >> YOU DID NOT?\n>> I CAME OVER TO WHOLE FOODS BECAUSE I FELT SAFE THERE.\nBECAUSE I GO THERE EVERY DAY. >> Reporter: HOW LONG WAS THIS\nBLAST IN THIS SOUND THAT YOU DESCRIBED HERE?\nI KNOW IT'S TOUGH UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT HOW LONG WERE\nYOU HEARING THAT SOUND? >> I EXPECTED IT TO STOP, AND IT\nDIDN'T STOP. IT JUST KEPT GOING.\nAND THAT'S WHEN THINGS STARTED SHAKING.\nTHAT'S WHEN I KNEW IT WAS SERIOUS.\nAND THAT'S WHEN THE PEOPLE STARTED RUNNING FROM THE BLOCK.\nFROM 23RD STREET AROUND TO SEVENTH AVENUE.\nAN SPLOESKS SOME                  SORT.\n>> I CAN SEE THAT YOU'RE SHAKING A LITTLE BIT.\n>> BECAUSE IT'S REALLY HITTING ME.\nI MEAN, IT JUST GOT OFF THE BUS. IT'S HITTING ME NOW.\nAND I WAS WALKING FROM THE EAST SIDE, AND I HAPPENED TO GET ON\nTHE 23RD STREET CROSS TOWN BUS. >> DO YOU REMEMBER APPROXIMATELY\nWHAT TIME THIS WAS? I KNOW IT'S TOUGH --\n>> ABOUT AN HOUR AGO. >> YEAH, ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.\nTHAT I RECALL. AND THEN I SAW SO MANY FIRE\nTRUCKS AND THINGS WERE GOING DOWN THE STREET.\nSO THERE'S MANY MORE DOWN THERE. >> Reporter: OKAY, SO THAT'S\nSOLEI, SHE WAS AN EYEWITNESS. SHE HEARD AN ENORMOUS BOOM.\nIT THREW YOU OFF YOUR FEET, ALMOST?\nIT DID, HUH? >> IT WAS SHAKING.\nIT WAS NOT NORMAL. I'VE NEVER FELT THAT BEFORE.\n>> Reporter: AGAIN, THAT IS JUST ONE EYEWITNESS ACCOUNT WE HAVE\nHERE RIGHT NOW. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE YOU BACK TO\nTHE SCENE. WE HAVE HELICOPTERS THAT ARE IN\nTHE AIR RIGHT NOW. SOME SEARCH LIGHTS GOING ON SOME\nOF THE BUILDINGS. YOU'VE GOT THE FDNY THAT ARE\nHERE, STANDING, I DON'T KNOW G, AGAIN, WE ARE ON BETWEEN 24th\nAND 23RD ON SEVENTH AVENUE. 25 PEOPLE INJURED.\nTHE FDNY TOLD US TWO CIVILIANS ON THE STREET, WHICH I DON'T\nKNOW WHAT THAT MEANS IN TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT THE OTHER 23\nWHERE THEY WERE INJURED. THAT'S STILL WHAT WE'RE TRYING\nTO GET ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS, JUDGE.\n>> BRIAN, I DON'T KNOW IF THE SOLIE IS STILL THERE, BUT I'M\nCURIOUS ABOUT THIS DUMPSTER. NOW, I'VE BEEN GETTING SOME\nINFORMATION THAT IS CERTAINLY NOT, YOU KNOW, CONFIRMED, THAT\nTHERE'S TALK THAT THE DUMPSTER HAD SOME -- THAT THEY WERE DOING\nSOME CONSTRUCTION. DOES SHE REMEMBER THE DUMPSTER\nBEING THERE? >> Reporter: FROM WHAT SHE SOLD\nUS, IF YOU CAN COME BACK IN, JUDGE JEANINE WANTS TO KNOW, IF\nYOU REMEMBER SEEING THE DUMPSTER.\nBECAUSE I KNOW YOU WERE DOWN THE BLOCK.\n>> NO, I DID NOT SEE A DUMPSTER. I JUST SAW THE SMOKE AND I SAW\nIT AS IT WAS GOING BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, I SAW THE SMOKE COMING\nOUT. RUNNING.\nAND I STARTED RUNNING WITH THEM DOWN SEVENTH AVENUE.\n>> Reporter: DOWN SEVENTH AVENUE.\n>> AND I CAME HERE TO WHOLE FOODS, BECAUSE I FELT SAFE,\nBECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON.\nI SOUNDED SO ABNORMAL. I'VE NEVER BEEN INVOLVED BY\nANYTHING LIKE THAT. AND I HAD JUST GOTTEN OFF THE\nBUS. SO IT JUST DAWNED ON ME, I WOULD\nHAVE BEEN THERE. SO, IT'S NOW HITTING ME.\n>> BRIAN, HOW CLOSE TO THE BUILDING ITSELF WAS THE SMOKE?\n>> Reporter: SO HOW CLOSE TO THE BUILDING ITSELF WAS THE SMOKE?\n>> TO ME IT DIDN'T LOOK -- TO ME IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE IT WAS A\nBUILDING. IT JUST LOOKED LIKE SOMETHING IN\nTHE MIDDLE OF THE STREET. >> IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS IN THE\nMIDDLE OF THE STREET? >> YES, FOR ME.\nIT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE THE BUILDING, IT LOOKED LIKE THERE\nWAS JUST -- >> IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE THERE WAS\nA BUILDING THAT HAD CAUGHT FIRE. >> I DIDN'T SEE ANY FIRE OR\nANYTHING FROM HERE. I SAW BIG CLOUDS OF SMOKE.\n>> FROM THE STREET. >> LIKE IT WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF\nTHE STREET. >> IT JUST WENT UP.\n>> JUDGE, I WAS JUST ACTUALLY COMING BACK FROM SEASIDE PARK,\nNEW JERSEY, WHERE WE OBVIOUSLY HAD THAT EXPLOSION.\nNOW, WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT ANY CONNECTION TO THAT, BUT I DON'T\nKNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER INFORMATION AS TO PERHAPS THAT\nDUMPSTER EXPLOSION. I SEE A PHOTO THAT IS\nCIRCULATING OUT THERE ABOUT -- THAT SHOWS A DUMPSTER, BUT I\nDON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN FILL ME IN WITH ANYMORE INFORMATION ABOUT\nTHAT. BUT FROM WHAT WE'RE GETTING ON\nTHE GROUND, THIS IS THE BEST WE'RE GETTING HERE.\n>> WHAT WE'VE HEARD SO FAR, BRIAN, IS THAT DUMPSTER, WHICH\nIS, YOU KNOW, IT IS -- IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEEN BLOWN TO BITS,\nLITERALLY, GIVEN THE COMPARISON OF IT TO THE SIZE OF THE HAND\nTHAT'S IN THAT PHOTO. YOU KNOW, MUST HAVE HAD A PRETTY\nBIG IED OR IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE DEVICE IN IT TO BE CRUSHED TO\nTHE EXTENT OR BLOWN UP TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS.\nAND I'M JUST CURIOUS AS TO WHERE THAT DUMPSTER WAS, WHEN IT WAS\nBLOWN UP. >> Reporter: RIGHT.\n>> AND YOU KNOW, THE IRONY, BRIAN, IS THAT TODAY, AS YOU\nJUST SAID ON THE JERSEY SHORE WAS THE IED IN THAT GARBAGE CAN,\nWHERE THAT RACE WAS PLANNED ON THE JERSEY SHORE.\n>> EXACTLY RIGHT. >> Reporter: WE HAVEN'T HEARD OF\nANY KIND OF CONNECTION. REMEMBER, WE WERE THERE ON THE\nJERSEY SHORE ALL DAY TODAY, REPORTING ON THAT PIPE BOMB,\nWHAT'S BEEN DESCRIBED AS A PIPE BOMB, THAT WAS PUT INTO A\nGARBAGE CAN IN SEASIDE PARK DURING THE MIDDLE OF WHAT WAS A\n5K CHARITY RUN TO SUPPORT OUR MARINES AND SAILORS.\nTHE FBI AND THE JOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCE WAS THERE AND STILL\nINVESTIGATING. THEY GAVE NO FURTHER DETAILS AS\nTO WHO THAT WAS OR -- THEY SAID IT WAS STILL INVESTIGATING, THAT\nIT WAS AN ACTIVE INVESTIGATION. AND THEREFORE, WE HAVEN'T HEARD\nANYTHING ABOUT A CONNECTION TO THAT HERE.\nBUT OBVIOUSLY, THE FACT THAT THIS IS AN EXPLOSION,\nPRELIMINARY REPORTS COMING FROM A DUMPSTER, IT'S GOT TO BE\nCONCERNING AT THE VERY LEAST. >> RIGHT, RIGHT.\nAND AS THEY INDICATED, WITH THE CLOSURE OF ALL THE STREETS AND\nTHE CLOSED TRAFFIC THERE, THEY ARE CONTINUING TO MAKE SURE THAT\nTHERE AREN'T ANY ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS.\nNO CONFIRMATION OF ANY OTHER INFORMATION AS IT RELATES TO\nPOSSIBLE OTHER DEVICES, BUT CERTAINLY, THEY ARE ON THE\nLOOKOUT IN THE EVENT -- >> Reporter: WE ARE GETTING --\nWE'VE GOT BOMB -- IF YOU LOOK OVER HEAR, WE'VE GOT SOME\nBOMB-SNIFFING DOGS THAT ARE GOING BY, JUDGE.\nTHEY'RE STILL VERY MUCH SEARCHING THIS SCENE FOR\nANYTHING THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE -- ANY POSSIBLE IEDs OR OTHER\nEXPLOSIVE DEVICES. YOU CAN SEE THAT RIGHT THERE,\nRIGHT NEXT TO OUR CAMERA CREW. YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE AND THE MEDIA,\nAS CLOSE AS WE CAN GET, BUT THIS DOG IS GOING BY EVERYTHING RIGHT\nNOW. SO, YEAH, AN ACTIVE CRIME SCENE,\nTHEY'RE LOOKING AND TRYING TO SEE WHAT -- WHETHER OR NOT THERE\nIS ANYTHING ELSE. BUT, AGAIN, THE FACT THAT\nTHEY'VE LET US THIS CLOSE IS A GOOD SIGN AT THE VERY LEAST THAT\nTHEY'VE GOT SOMEWHAT A CONTROL ON AT LEAST THIS BLOCK, AT LEAST\nTHIS AREA. >> ALL RIGHT, BRIAN, WE'RE GOING\nTO COME BACK TO YOU IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES.\nAND WE ARE -- WE'RE BEGINNING TO LET YOU TRY TO FIND A LITTLE\nMORE OUT ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON THERE ON THE SCENE.\nAND WE'LL BE BACK TO YOU IN A COUPLE MINUTES.\n>> OKAY, JUDGE. >> THOMAS RUSKIN IS BACK WITH\nME, FORMER DETECTIVE, NYPD. ALL RIGHT, YOU HEARD WHAT BRIAN\nHAS SAID. YOU KNOW, WITH THE EXPLOSION,\nAPPARENTLY, A HUGE, WE'RE HEARING NOW POSSIBILITY OF UP TO\n25 INJURIES IN THIS EXPLOSION, CONTINUING CRIME SCENE\nINVESTIGATION WITH THE BOMB-SNIFFING DOGS, WHAT ELSE\nHAVE YOU HEARD, IF ANYTHING? >> THE ONLY THING I'VE HEARD IS\nTHAT THE BACKGROUND YOU SAW OF THE LIVE SHOT IS LOOKING FOR THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF A SECONDARY DEVICE.\nNOW, WE SHOULD KEEP IN MIND, IT'S A LITTLE PREMATURE TO\nDETERMINE IF IT REALLY WAS AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE THAT HURT\nPEOPLE OR BLOW THAT DUMPSTER UP. BUT WE CAN REMEMBER THAT ABOUT A\nMONTH AGO, TWO MONTHS AGO, IN CENTRAL PARK, IT WAS THE\nGENTLEMAN WHO JUMPED OFF THE ROCK ON TO AN IMPROVISED DEVICE\nAND BUST HIS LEG. SO IT'S NOT UNCOMMON OR OUT OF\nTHE ORDINARY TO BELIEVE THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN AN EXPLOSIVE\nDEVICE THAT WAS PUT THERE, BUT IT'S STILL A LITTLE BIT\nPREMATURE TO DETERMINE THAT. >> TO DETERMINE WHAT?\nIT WAS CLEARLY AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE.\nYOU THINK SOMEBODY WAS JUST THROWING SOMETHING AWAY AND IT\nBLEW UP BY ACCIDENT? >> WELL, IF THERE WAS\nCONSTRUCTION, IF THERE WAS CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS THAT WERE\nPUT IN THERE, POSSIBLE FLAMMATORY TYPE OF LIQUIDS OR\nOTHER THINGS, IT'S POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE THREW A CIGARETTE IN A\nCONTAINER AND BLEW IT UP. IT WOULD TAKE A PRETTY LARGE\nEXPLOSION TO MANGLE A CONTAINER LIKE THAT, BUT WE DON'T KNOW IF\nIT WAS A DEVICE PURPOSEFULLY PUT THERE TO EXPLODE OR AN\nACCIDENTAL TYPE OF EXPLOSION. >> WELL, I GUESS THEY WOULD BE\nABLE TO TELL THAT FORENSICALLY IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE PIP\nMEAN, WHAT THE DEVICE WAS MADE OF AND, YOU KNOW, BASED ON\nTHINGS LIKE THE SHRAPNEL AND, YOU KNOW, HOW IT ACTUALLY\nEXPLODED. I'M SURE THEY'LL FIND THAT OUT.\n>> WELL, THE BOMB SQUAD, AS SOON AS THE AREA IS SAFE, WILL MOVE\nIN. THEY WILL TAKE SAMPLES FROM THE\nDUMPSTER AND THE SHRAPNEL, AS YOU ALLUDED TO, AND THEY WILL\nTHEN TEST IT TO SEE IF IT WAS A FLAMMATORY -- YOU KNOW,\nINFLAMMATORY DEVICE OR IF IT WAS LIQUIDS OR CHEMICALS THAT MAY\nHAVE BEEN SPONTANEOUSLY COMBUSTED.\n>> WELL, THAT WOULD BE VERY INTERESTING, THAT -- TO SEE WHAT\nEXACTLY HAPPENED. BUT I -- YOU KNOW, AS I SPOKE\nWITH COMMISSIONER KAIRK, I DON'T BELIEVE IN COINCIDENCES, AND I\nDON'T LIKE THE FACT THAT ON THE WEST SIDE OF MANHATTAN, WE HAVE\nWHAT APPEARS TO BE A PIPE BOMB AND AN IED GOING OFF WITHIN,\nWHAT, 12 HOURS OF EACH OTHER. ONE AT 9:00 THIS MORNING AND ONE\nABOUT 9:00 TONIGHT. VERY DISCONCERTING.\n>> EXACTLY. I THINK -- LISTEN, ON ALL\nAPPEARANCE, IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE A POSSIBLE IMPROVISED\nEXPLOSIVE DEVICE, YES, IT DOES. BUT I THINK IT'S TOO QUICK UNTIL\nTHE BOMB SQUAD, YOU KNOW, REALLY DENSER IF IT WAS WHAT THE CAUSE\nOF THE EXPLOSION IS. BUT IT IS SUSPICIOUS.\nYOU HAVE ONE IN JERSEY, YOU HAVE THIS.\nBUT NO ONE'S TAKEN, YOU KNOW, CREDIT FOR IT FROM EVERYTHING WE\nKNOW THUS FAR. >> WELL, YOU KNOW, THE FACT THAT\nTHEY'RE NOT TAKING CREDIT FOR IT IS NOT UNUSUAL, AS WE KNOW, WITH\nA LOT OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS, AL QAEDA IN PARTICULAR, THEY TAKE A\nWHILE BEFORE THEY DO. OR IT MAY BE AN INDICATION, TOM,\nTHAT THERE'S MORE TO COME AND THEY'RE NOT READY TO TAKE\nCREDIT. >> THAT'S RIGHT.\n>> AND I SAY THAT WITH ABSOLUTELY NO BASIS OR REASON TO\nSAY IT, BUT YOU KNOW, UNTIL WE KNOW THE FACTS, THAT'S THE\nPROBLEM WITH THESE, YOU KNOW, ON THE SCENE REPORTING.\nALL WE KNOW FOR SURE IS THERE WAS AN EXPLOSION IN MANHATTAN ON\nTHE WEST SIDE IN CHELSEA IN THE AREA OF 23rd AND 6th.\n25 PEOPLE THAT WE KNOW OF, FDNY REPORTING, HAVE BEEN INJURED AND\nTAKEN TO AREA HOSPITALS. TRAFFIC IS CLOSED BETWEEN THE\nEAST AND WEST SIDE, FROM 34th STREET.\nTEMPORARY COMMAND CENTER HAS BEEN SET UP AND RIGHT NOW BOMB\nSQUAD, BOMB DOGS, A LOT OF SECURITY THERE UNTIL THEY FIND\nOUT WHAT EXACTLY IS GOING ON AND UNTIL THEY CAN CLEAR THE AREA\nFOR COMMUTERS AND PEOPLE IN THE AREA.\nSO WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THIS AND UNTIL WE GO OFF\nTHE AIR. AND NOW, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE\nTHINGS THAT WE THINK IS TO HAVE GREAT CONCERN, OF COURSE, IS THE\nCOUNTERTERRORISM DEPARTMENT IN THE NEW YORK CITY POLICE\nDEPARTMENT. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION\nOF THAT, TOM. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SPEAK TO\nIT, BUT, YOU KNOW, WHEN COMMISSIONER -- OR WHEN MAYOR DE\nBLASIO CAME IN, HE HAD A LOT OF FEELINGS ABOUT THE\nCOUNTERTERRORISM SQUAD, AND WASN'T QUITE SURE WHETHER OR NOT\nHE WAS GOING TO KEEP IT. >> RIGHT.\nAND BILL BRATTON, WHO JUST RETIRED THE OTHER DAY, AND NOW\nJAMES O'NEIL, WHO BECAME POLICE COMMISSIONER LESS THAN 24 HOURS\nAGO ARE GOING TO CONTINUE -- >> ALL RIGHT.\nRIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO TO ERIC SHAWN FOR CONTINUING\nCOVERAGE ON THE EXPLOSION IN NEW YORK CITY.\nERIC SHAWN, NEXT.",

ON 23rd STREET IN THE CHELSEA\nSECTION OF MANHATTAN. AT LEAST 25 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN\nINJURED. THIS SUPPOSED DEVICE, NOT YET\nCONFIRMED IT WAS AN IED AT ALL, IN A DUMPSTER, APPARENTLY WENT\nOFF EARLIER THIS MORNING, AND INJURED 25 PEOPLE.\nI WANT TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR AND RESPONSIBLE THAT THERE IS NO\nCONFIRMATION THAT THIS WAS, INDEED, AN IED OF ANY SORT, BUT\nCERTAINLY SOMEONE COULD COME TO SOME TYPE OF CONCLUSION\nCONSIDERING THE HISTORY AND RECORD OF BOMBS THAT WE HAVE HAD\nIN NEW YORK CITY, NOT FOR QUITE SOME TIME, IN THE '50s AND '60s,\nBOMBING OF THE LaGUARDIA TERMINAL IN 1975 THAT KILLED 11\nPEOPLE AT THAT TIME.

BUT THIS, OF COURSE, CONCERN OF\nPOSSIBLE TERRORISM IN THE WAKE OF THE PIPE BOMB THAT DID GO\nOFF, THANKFULLY, EARLY, IN SEASIDE HEIGHTS EARLIER THIS\nMORNING. THAT AT 9:30, JUST BEFORE A\nMARINE RUN AND 5K THAT WOULD BENEFIT FAMILIES OF OUR MARINES\nWENT OFF. OBVIOUSLY, NO ONE WAS INJURED,\nTHANKFULLY IN SEASIDE HEIGHTS. THAT BECAUSE THAT 5K WAS\nDELAYED. BUT YOU'RE LOOKING AT A GOOGLE\nMAP THERE OF WHERE THIS EXPLOSION OCCURRED.\nAND OUR BRIAN LLENAS HAS BEEN ON THE SITE AT THE SCENE RIGHT NEXT\nTO THAT AREA WITH THE VERY LATEST.\nBRIAN, WHAT DO YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW?\n>> Reporter: GOOD EVENING, ERIC. WHAT WE KNOW IS ABOUT 8:30 P.M.,\nFROM WHAT WE'RE UNDERSTANDING, THERE WAS REPORT OF AN EXPLOSION\nHERE ON 23 AND 7th AVENUE. RIGHT NOW WE'RE BETWEEN 24th\nSTREET AND 23rd AND 7th. THE FDNY TELL US THAT THERE ARE\nIN FACT 25 INJURED. TWO OF THOSE HAPPENED TO BE\nCIVILIANS THAT WERE INJURED WHILE THEY WERE ON THE STREET.\nAS TO WHETHER OR NOT WHERE THIS CAME FROM, WE DO NOT KNOW.\nWE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THIS WAS ANY KIND OF EXPLOSIVE DEVICE.\nWE ONLY KNOW THAT THERE WAS AN EXPLOSION SO LOUD THAT IT SHOOK\nMANY OF THE AREA BUILDINGS. PEOPLE PHYSICALLY CAME OUT OF\nTHEIR BUILDINGS, BECAUSE IT WAS SO LOUD AND SO FORCEFUL THAT\nPEOPLE ON THE BLOCKS FROM WHERE THIS EXPLOSION APPARENTLY\nHAPPENED FELT IT, TO THE POINT MANY OF THEM CAME OUT TO THE\nSTREET TO SEE WHAT WE ARE SEE RIGHT NOW.\nTAKE A LOOK AT THE SCENE. THIS EXPLOSION, THE FDNY SAID\nTHIS HAPPENED AT 23rd AND 6th, WHICH IS THE NEXT AVENUE BY.\nBUT WE'RE STILL SEEING FDNY ON THE SCENE, MANY FDNY FIRE\nTRUCKS, AND WE'VE SEEN BOMB DOGS GO BY AS WELL, SEARCHING THE\nAREA, PERHAPS FOR ANY OTHER DEVICES OR ANY EXPLOSIVE DEVICES\nIN THE AREA. WE DO HAVE A WITNESS THAT WE\nMET, AS SOON AS WE GOT HERE ON THE SCENE.\nHER NAME IS SOLEI. YOU WERE JUST WITH US.\nIF YOU CAN JUST EXPLAIN TO THE OUR VIEWERS ONE MORE TIME WHAT\nYOU SAW. YOU HAD JUST GOTTEN OFF THE BUS,\nAND JUST EXPLAIN TO EVERYBODY BACK HOME WHAT YOU WITNESSED?\n>> I JUST GOT OFF OF THE CROSSTOWN BUS ON 23rd STREET, ON\n7th AVENUE. AND I WENT INTO A CONVENIENCE\nSTORE TO GET A MAGAZINE. I CAME OUTSIDE AND I HEARD BOOM.\nAND IT WAS SO HUGE AND IT DIDN'T SOUND -- DIDN'T SEEM NORMAL.\nAND I SAW A BIG CLOUD OF SMOKE. I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT WAS COMING\nFROM. IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS IN THE\nMIDDLE OF THE STREET. AND IT WAS SHAKING.\nIT WAS SHAKING MY BODY. IT WAS SHAKING -- IT WAS VERY\nFORCEFUL. AND IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE IT WAS\nGOING TO STOP. I KNEW THAT IT WAS SOMETHING --\nSOMETHING WAS VERY WRONG. PEOPLE STARTED TO RUNNING FROM\n23rd STREET AROUND THE CORNER AND I RAN WITH THEM.\nAND WE ALL CAME OVER HERE AND THEN I WENT TO WHOLE FOODS,\nBECAUSE I FELT SAFE",

AND OF COURSE, THE INVESTIGATION\nNOW ONLY BEGINS. WAS THIS A TERRORIST ATTACK?\nWAS IT A BOMB THAT SOMEONE PUT INSIDE A DUMPSTER?\nWAS IT FIREWORKS OR A CHERRY BOMB OR SOMETHING ELSE?\nYOU'RE LOOKING AT WHAT WE ARE TOLD IS A PHOTO OF THAT DUMPSTER\nIN WHICH THIS VERY LARGE, AS IT IS CALLED, EXPLOSION WENT OFF.\nIT BLEW OUT WINDOWS OF A BROWNSTONE BUILDING ON THE\nSTREET, BLEW OUT WINDOWS -- CARS THAT WERE PARKED ON THE STREET.\nSO CLEARLY, IT WAS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO DO SOME DAMAGE AND\nTHANKFULLY, ON A CROWDED SATURDAY NIGHT ON A BEAUTIFUL\nFALL NIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK CITY, WHEN PEOPLE ARE JUST\nENJOYING THE JOYS OF THIS TOWN, NO ONE WAS KILLED.\nWE HAVE TO THANK -- BE THANKFUL OF THAT AND COUNT OUR PRAYERS SO\nFAR THIS EVENING. NEW YORK CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT\nREPORTS EXPLOSIVE DEVICES WITH MULTIPLE INJURIES.\nTHAT IS THE FIRST TIME THAT WE'VE SEEN THE TERM \"EXPLOSIVE\nDEVICE.\" WE'RE AWAITING FOR MORE\nCONFIRMATION OF WHAT POTENTIALLY THIS COULD HAVE BEEN.\nWE'RE TOLD THE NEW YORK CITY MAYOR, BILL DE BLASIO, IS ON HIS\nWAY TO THIS SCENE. HE WAS AT GRACIE MANSION, THE\nOFFICIAL RESIDENCE OF THE NEW YORK CITY MAIRPS.\nTHAT'S ON THE UPPER EAST SIDE, MULTIPLE MILES AWAY.\n10, 12 MILES AWAY OR SO. SO WE EXPECT TO SEE HIM AND GET\nA BRIEFING FROM THE NEW YORK CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE\nCOMMISSIONER AS WELL AS THE MAYOR AS SOON AS WE HAVE IT.\nWITNESSES DESCRIBING AN EXPLOSION AND A BLAST THAT WAS\nDEAFENING, LOUD, JUST COMPLETELY EAR-RINGING SUDDENLY AND SCARING\nEVERYONE, OBVIOUSLY, ON THE STREET IN LIGHT OF THE TERRORIST\nMODE THAT WE ARE LIVING IN NOW. MANY WONDERING IF THIS WAS,\nINDEED, SOME TYPE OF RANDOM TERRORIST ATTACK, WHERE SOMEONE\nWOULD PUT SOMETHING INSIDE A DUMPSTER, TOO.\nAS ONE OF OUR GUESTS JUST SAID A FEW MINUTES AGO, TO TRY TO SEW\nUNCERTAINTY AND FEAR OR IF THIS IS SOMETHING ELSE.\nIT IS EXTREMELY EARLY IN THE INVESTIGATION.\nMANY TIMES EARLY REPORTS ARE WRONG.\nWE DO NOT WANT TO GET AHEAD OF OURSELVES WAITING FOR\nCONFIRMATION FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES, NO\nHEART WHAT THE WITNESSES SAY, NO MATTER WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING\nTHIS EVENING, WE WILL WAIT FOR THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS OF\nTHE CITY AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CONFIRM WHAT THEY\nTHINK HAPPENED THERE TONIGHT. BRIAN LLENAS HAS BEEN REPORTING\nLIVE. JUST A NORMAL NEW YORK CITY\nSTREET WITH THE RESTAURANTS AND SHOPS.\nSO IF YOU WANT TO SEW FEAR, SADLY, TRAGICALLY, THAT WOULD\nPOTENTIALLY BE THE TYPE OF PLACE TO DO IT?\n>> RIGHT, IN THE MIDDLE OF MIDTOWN, MANHATTAN.\nTHERE'S A WHOLE FOODS RESTAURANT HERE.\nWHEN THE EXPLOSION WENT OFF, A WITNESS DESCRIBED A FIREBALL IN\nBETWEEN CLOUDS OF SMOKE. SOMEBODY ELSE SAID THAT IT WAS A\nDEAFENING SOUND FOR LIKE 15 SECONDS.\nALL AROUND THIS AREA. TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT MORE\nCONTEXT AND PERSPECTIVE, AS WE AWAIT THE AUTHORITIES, AGAIN THE\nPRELIMINARY INFORMATION IS OFTEN WRONG IN THESE TYPES OF\nSITUATIONS. WE'VE HEARD TWO ACCOUNTS OF\nOBVIOUSLY PEOPLE RUNNING WITH DUST IN THEIR EYES.\nA DEAFENING SOUND. PEOPLE UNSURE.\nPEOPLE COMING OUT OF THEIR BUILDINGS.\nTHE EXPLOSION SO LOUD THAT WE HEARD ONE WITNESS TELL US, ON  EXPLOSION AND THEIR BUILDING\nSHOOK A LITTLE BIT. SO TWO AVENUES AWAY.\nTHE FDNY SAID THIS EXPLOSION HAPPENED ON 23rd AND 6th.\n25 ARE INJURED. THANKFULLY, NONLIFE-THREATENING\nINJURIES. A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE\nLOCATION. RESIDENTS HERE TELL US, BASED ON\nTHE INITIAL THAT WE SEE, WE BELIEVE THIS EXPLOSION HAPPENED\nBETWEEN 7th AND 6th, WHICH WOULD MEAN WE SEE WHERE THIS FIRE\nTRUCK IS TO THE LEFT. SO THAT FIRE TRUCK IS ON 23rd\nAND 7th. IT'S TO THE LEFT OF THAT BETWEEN\n7th AND 6th AVENUE. THERE IS A REHABILITATION CENTER\nFOR THE BLIND THERE AND THERE IS SCAFFOLDING AND CONSTRUCTION\nTHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN FRONT OF THAT BUILDING.\nWE DON'T KNOW WHERE THE EXPLOSION CAME FROM.\nWE KNOW THAT THE FDNY HAS CALLED AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE",

A LOT OF RESTAURANTS, LOTS OF\nBARS, THE FAMED CHELSEA HOTEL, WHERE SID VICIOUS DIED BACK IN\nTHE PUNK ROCK DAYS IS RIGHT DOWN ON THAT STREET.\nSO IT WAS A VERY CROWDED SIDEWALK AND A VERY LOVELY LATE\n70s, EARLY 80s TEMPERATURES HEAR IN NEW YORK CITY, WHICH CAUSED\nSOME TO SPECULATE THAT POTENTIALLY THIS COULD BE SOME\nTYPE OF A TERRORIST ATTACK.

WE'RE MATING FOR BILL DE BLASIO\nAND POLICE AND FIRE OFFICIALS TO COME TO THE MICROPHONE.\nBUT AFTER COVERING DECADES COVERING THESE TYPE OF EVENTS IN\nNEW YORK CITY, IT IS VERY HEARTENING AND OPTIMISTIC TO\nKNOW THAT AUTHORITIES ARE COMING RATHER QUICKLY TO ADDRESS US AND\nEL THE US WHAT THEY THINK IT IS AND TO GIVE US THE VERY LATEST\nON THE SITUATION ON 23rd STREET, BECAUSE CERTAINLY NEW YORKERS\nRATTLED WITH A LOT OF NERVES UNDER WHAT WE HAVE BEEN FACING,\nWHAT WE HAVE GONE THROUGH, JUST NOT EVEN A WEEK AFTER WE\nSOLEMNLY COMMEMORATED THE SOMBER DAY OF SEPTEMBER 11th HERE IN\nNEW YORK CITY.

WHAT I'M ALSO BEING TOLD IS I\nDON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE FOOTAGE OF THIS BUT THE BUILDING IT\nHAPPENED IN FRONT OF AS YOU REPORTED, DON, IS THE\nASSOCIATION FOR THE BLIND. IT'S A 210-UNIT BUILDING.\n14 STORIES. AND IT'S FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE\nDIFFERENT VISUAL IMPAIRMENTS THAT LIVE HERE IN CHELSEA.\nIT'S LOCATED RIGHT NEXT TO A CHURCH.\nAND FROM WHERE I'M STANDING THEY NOW HAVE SORT OF LIGHT TOWERS ON\n23rd STREET DOWN THE BLOCK WHERE IT SUPPOSEDLY TOOK PLACE THAT'S\nILLUMINATING THAT AREA. THIS BUILDING IS COVERED IN\nSCAFFOLDING. AND IT'S A BUILDING THAT I KNOW\nWELL BECAUSE IT'S BEEN GOING THROUGH NOW A TWO-YEAR\nRENOVATION. SO THERE HAS BEEN CONSTRUCTION\nGOING ON AT THIS BUILDING FOR TWO YEARS.\nTHEY'RE DOING A FULL RENOVATION OF THE BUILDING.\nSO IT DOES MAKE SENSE THAT THERE WERE A SERIES OF DUMPSTERS THAT\nWERE OUTSIDE ON 23rd STREET ON THE NORTH SIDE OF 23rd STREET.\nYOU KNOW, THIS BLOCK HAS RESTAURANTS, A DUNKIN' DONUTS.\nTHERE'S A BEST BUY ON THE CORNER THAT I'M ON RIGHT NOW.\nSO THIS IS A VERY, VERY HEAVILY TRAFFICKED AREA.\nIT'S SATURDAY NIGHT. AND WE'RE NOT FAR FROM MADISON\nSQUARE PARK, FROM THE FLATIRON DISTRICT.\nTHIS IS A VERY BUSY AREA. SO IT'S NOT SURPRISING SOMETHING\nHAPPENED. >> LET ME ASK YOU THIS.\nI'VE GOT TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. I KNOW THE NEIGHBORHOOD VERY\nWELL. I LIVED ON THAT VERY STREET, ON\n23rd STREET BUT A LITTLE BIT FURTHER DOWN BETWEEN 10th AND\n11th. IT'S ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE\nSTREET AS YOU SAID. ONE REPORT WAS 133 WEST 23rd.\nTHE OTHER WAS 135. IS IT A COMBINATION OF BOTH?\nDO THE BUILDINGS SPAN BOTH ADDRESSES?\n>> I'M BEING TOLD IT'S 135 WEST 23rd STREET.\n>> OKAY. ALL RIGHT, COUNCILMAN, WE NEED\nTO MOVE ON. GO HEAD, POPPY.\n>> WEI WANT TO GET TO RACHEL CRANE OUR CORRESPONDENT AT\nBELLEVUE HOSPITAL ON THE EAST SIDE OF MANHATTAN.\nTHAT'S WHERE SOME OF THE INJURED WERE TAKEN, AGAIN, AT LEAST 25\nINJURED. RACHEL, WHAT ARE YOU HEARING\nFROM THE HOSPITAL AT THIS TIME IN TERMS OF THE EXTENT OF THE\nINJURIES, HOW MANY PATIENTS ARE GETTING?\n>> WE DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION YET.\nWE ARE HERE OUTSIDE BELLEVUE HOSPITAL.\nTHERE ARE MANY POLICE OFFICERS. STRATEGIC RESPONSE RIGHT WHERE\nTHE AMBULANCES HAVE BEEN COMING IN.\nON OUR WAY WE SAW SEVERAL AMBULANCES.\nWE SPOKE TO SEVERAL PEOPLE WHO SAID THEY'D HEARD THE EXPLOSION,\nTHAT WHEN THEY EMERGED FROM THE SUBWAY THAT PEOPLE WERE RUNNING.\nBUT AS WE POINTED OUT, RIGHT NOW WE JUST KNOW THAT SOME OF\nTHOSE -- AT LEAST 25 VICTIMS HAVE BEEN TRANSPORTED HERE TO\nBELLEVUE BUT WE DONE KNOW THE EXTENT OF THEIR INJURIES.\n>> SO YOU'RE -- HAVE YOU SEEN ANY OF THE PATIENTS COMING IN?\nYES OR NO? >> NO, WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE\nPATIENTS COME DIRECTLY TO BELLEVUE.\n>> ALL RIGHT, RACHEL. >> NONE OF THE AMBULANCES WERE\nPULLING IN WHILE WE WERE HERE, DON.\n>> OKAY, RACHEL, WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU.\nMAKE SURE YOU STAND BY. DON LEMON HERE WITH POPPY\nHARLOW. POPPY IS USUALLY ON THE AIR THIS\nEVENING. POPPY OF COURSE DILIGENTLY RAN\nBACK HERE. YOU WERE ON YOUR WAY DOWN --\nFAIRLY CLOSE TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD.\n>> RIGHT. I WAS HEADING HOME TO BROOKLYN.\nBUT IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE WE WENT THROUGH BROOKLYN, NOT\nTHROUGH MANHATTAN BECAUSE THE TRAFFIC WAS SO BAD.\nNOW WE KNOW WHY. YOU'RE LOOKING AT SOME NEW VIDEO\nIN TO US TONIGHT FROM CHELSEA, FROM THAT INTERSECTION AT 23rd\nAND 6th AVENUE AFTER THIS EXPLOSION WENT OFF THERE.\nAROUND 8:45 P.M. MANY, MANY EMERGENCY RESPONSE\nVEHICLES. MANY POLICE OFFICERS.\nNEW YORK COUNTERTERRORISM. THE MAYOR IS THERE ON SCENE.\nAS WE CONTINUE TO DISCUSS -- >> BEFORE WE BRING ERROL IN I\nWANT TO SAY -- WE WANT TO GET INFORMATION ABOUT THE SUBWAY\nLINES BECAUSE AS POPPY POINTED OUT IT IS A VERY BIG DEAL IF\nTHEY SHUT THE SUBWAYS DOWN. >> I CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST\nTIME THE SUBWAYS WERE SHUT DOWN. MAYBE HURRICANE SANDY.\n>> AND THEN 9/11 BEFORE THAT. UNLESS THERE'S FLOODING OR\nSOMETHING BUT USUALLY THEY DON'T SHUT IT DOWN THEY'LL TRY TO\nREROUTE IT. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A\nSUBWAY PLATFORM OR AN ENTRANCE OR AN EXIT BEING CLOSED --\n>> WHICH WOULD MAKE SENSE SAID CLOSE THE SUBWAYS NEXT TO THERE\nSO THERE WOULD NOT BE MASSES OF PEOPLE COMING OUT OF THE TRAIN\nBECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO DO THEIR EMERGENCY RESPONSE --\n>> NOT FAR FROM NEW YORK 1. CHELSEA MARKET, CORRECT?\n>> WE'RE IN CHELSEA MARKET, AS A MATTER OF FACT.\nA SHORT WALK -- >> ERROL LEWIS IS HERE.\nTIME WARNER -- >> FROM THE SCENE THERE.\nAND MY COLLEAGUES THERE ARE DOING WHAT WE DO, WHICH IS\nTAKING PHONE CALLS FROM VIEWERS, GETTING A SENSE OF WHAT'S GOING\nON. I THINK THEY WERE ONE OF THE\nFIRST ON THE SCENE JUST TEN BLOCKS AWAY.\nLOOK, IT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT WHEN NEW YORKERS HEAR THIS\nKIND OF THING SOME OF THE CALLS, IT MIGHT SEEM HUMOROUS TO\nNON-NEW YORKERS BUT AS NEW YORKERS WE WOULD UNDERSTAND\nTHIS. PEOPLE WOULD CALL IN AND SAY I\nHEARD THE EXPLOSION AND I WENT OUT TO THE DELI.\nOR HEY, IT'S A DUMPSTER FIRE, YOU SEE THESE AROUND THE CITY\nALL THE TIME. IT'S NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL.\nSO NEW YORKERS CAN BE A LITTLE BLASE JUST BECAUSE THE CITY IS\nSO NOISY. FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO\nHAPPEN IN CHELSEA, CHELSEA AS HAS NOT BEEN ONE OF THE AREAS\nWHERE YOU EXPECT TO HEAR THIS KIND OF THING.\nWE KNOW FURTHER DOWNTOWN THE WORLD TRADE CENTER SITE HAS BEEN\nA TERRORIST TARGET FOR A LONG TIME.\nWE KNOW MIDTOWN THINGS HAPPEN BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S TRYING TO\nGET INTO TIMES SQUARE, NOT JUST NEW YEAR'S EVE BUT LOTS OF OTHER\nTIMES OF THE YEAR AS WELL. IT'S A LITTLE UNUSUAL FOR WHAT\nIS TRULY A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD.\nWE KNOW ABOUT IT AS KIND OF AN ARTS DISTRICT AND WE KNOW ABOUT\nIT AS A PLACE WHERE LOTS OF THINGS GO ON BUT THERE ARE A LOT\nOF BROWNSTONE THERE'S. THERE ARE A LOT PEOPLE WHO LIVE\nTHERE. >> MARTY, YOU SAID LIVE\nPICTURES, RIGHT? YOU'RE LOOKING AT LIVE IMAGES\nNOW OF 23rd AND 6th AVENUE WHERE YOU STILL HAVE MANY, MANY\nEMERGENCY RESPONDERS. BUT YOU ALSO, DON, HAVE PEOPLE,\nNEW YORKERS GOING ABOUT THEIR EVENING.\nTRAFFIC IS FLOWING. AND THIS JUST SPEAKS TO NEW YORK\nAND THE FACT THAT THIS IS A BUSY SATURDAY NIGHT.\nTHEY'VE CORDONED OFF SOME AREAS. BUT NOT ALL THERE AT THAT\nINTERSECTION. WE HAVE LEARNED THAT THE NYPD\nACCORDING TO OUR SHIMON PROKUPESZ HAS INCREASED SECURITY\nACROSS NEW YORK CITY AS A PRECAUTION.\nTHAT'S ACCORDING TO A LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCE.\nINCREASING SECURITY ACROSS NEW YORK.\nLET'S BRING SHIMON IN. >> NYPD COUNTERTERRORISM UNIT IS\nALSO MONITORING THE SITUATION IN CHELSEA AS WELL.\n>> SHIMON, WHAT MORE DO YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF THE HEIGHTENED\nSECURITY ACROSS THE CITY RIGHT NOW?\n>> RIGHT. SO AS A PRECAUTION, BECAUSE LAW\nENFORCEMENT DOES NOT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED HERE, SPECIFICALLY YET.\nAND IT'S OUT OF JUST ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION, THEY DECIDED THEY'RE\nGOING TO REDEPLOY SOME OF THEIR COUNTERTERRORISM UNITS TO SORT\nOF SENSITIVE SITES, AREAS AROUND MANHATTAN THAT ARE MORE\nPOPULATED, TIMES SQUARE, OTHER TOURIST LOCATIONS JUST AS A\nPRECAUTION. THERE'S NOTHING TO INDICATE THAT\nTHERE IS SOMETHING ELSE ABOUT TO HAPPEN.\nAND THERE'S REALLY NOTHING TO INDICATE REALLY RIGHT NOW THAT\nWHAT EXPLODED HERE WAS A BOMB. I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU ONE\nOTHER THING THAT INVESTIGATORS ARE TELL ME, IS THEY'RE LOOKING\nAT POSSIBLY A CONSTRUCTION TOOLBOX WHICH WAS NEAR THE SITE\nOF THIS DUMPSTER WHICH MAY HAVE CAUSED THIS EXPLOSION.\nTHEY DON'T EXACTLY KNOW IF THAT'S WHAT CAUSED IT BUT\nTHEY'RE LOOKING AT THAT NOW. IF I COULD JUST SORT OF READ\nSOMETHING. THERE WAS I ALARGE CONSTRUCTION\nSITE TOOLBOX IN FRONT OF THIS LOCATION.\nSO THEY'RE LOOKING AT THAT NOW TO SEE IF MAYBE THAT CAUSED THE\nEXPLOSION. SO AGAIN, THEY REALLY STILL\nDON'T KNOW. THEY'RE GOING THROUGH\nEVERYTHING, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE, WHAT CAUSED\nTHE EXPLOSION-S AND SO THEY'RE TAKING EVERYTHING INTO\nCONSIDERATION AS THEY PROCESS THE SCENE TO SEE IF THEY CAN\nFIND ANY REMNANTS OF A BOMB OR SOMETHING ELSE THAT MAY HAVE\nCAUSED THIS EXPLOSION. >> THE ONLY THING, ERROL, IF\nWE -- STAND BY, SHIMON. THE ONLY THING, NOTHING AS YOU\nSAID, NOTHING STANDS OUT ABOUT THIS NEIGHBORHOOD EXCEPT FOR\nTHAT IT IS SORT OF AN ARTS AND CULTURAL DISTRICT, ALSO WAS\nKNOWN AS A GAY ENCLAVE. THAT HAS BEEN SORT OF GENTRIFIED\nNOW. IT WOULD BE INTERESTING -- WE\nDON'T KNOW WHAT THE CAUSE IS. TO LOOK AT FACTORS AS TO WHY\nSOMEONE, IF THIS IS INDEED SO, WOULD SPECIFICALLY PICK OUT THIS\nSPECIFIC NEIGHBORHOOD IN MANHATTAN.\n>> IT IS STRIKING. AND THERE'S NO GETTING AROUND\nIT. IF YOU WANTED TO LOOK FOR AN\nLGBT NEIGHBORHOOD, CHELSEA WOULD RANK VERY HIGH.\nFOLKS THINK OF GREENWICH VILLAGE BUT --\n>> AND HELL'S KITCHEN. YEAH.\n>> IT'S CHELSEA. OBVIOUSLY WE'RE NOT GOING TO\nJUMP TO CONCLUSIONS. WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT\nOR WHO MIGHT BE BEHIND IT OR CERTAINLY ANY MOTIVE.\nBUT IT'S GOT TO BE A SOURCE OF CONCERN FOR RESIDENTS IN THAT\nCOMMUNITY, ESPECIALLY AFTER WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN SOME OTHER CITIES\nAROUND THE WORLD, AFTER ORLANDO, AFTER PARIS.\n>> AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE, THIS IS A BIG WEEK IN NEW\nYORK CITY. THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THE\nU.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY, WHICH KICKS OFF THIS WEEK, WHICH MEANS\nWORLD LEADERS FROM ACROSS THE GLOBE ALL DESCEND ON NEW YORK\nCITY FOR THIS WEEK, WHICH IS FILLED, FILLED WITH SECURITY.\n>> A NEW POLICE COMMISSIONER -- >> TWO DAYS IN.\nYOU'RE LOOKING AT A PODIUM THERE WHERE THE PRESS IS GATHERED\nRIGHT NEAR THE SCENE OF THIS. BECAUSE THERE WILL BE A PRESS\nCONFERENCE ANY MOMENT. WE'LL BRING IT TO YOU LIVE WHEN\nIT HAPPENS. WE KNOW THE MAYOR DE BLASIO IS\nALREADY ON SITE. ONE WOULD ASSUME ERROL LEWIS\nHE'LL BE CHECKING IN WITH THE HEAD OF THE FDNY, THE HEAD OF\nTHE NYPD FIRST, RIGHT? AND TALKING TO THEM.\nGETTING A FULL PICTURE OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT BEFORE HE WILL\nBRIEF REPORTERS. >> ABSOLUTELY.\nOF COURSE THE MAYOR'S PERSONAL BODY\nBODYGUARD, HIS DETAIL IS NYPD. AND BUZZERS I'M SURE WERE GOING\nOFF AND THEY WILL COMPLETELY BRIEF HIM.\nNOT RUMOR, NOT HYPE, NOT SPECULATION.\nHE'LL TELL US WHAT HE KNOWS AND WHAT HE DOESN'T KNOW.\nHE, THE MAYOR, AND THE NYPD, HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS MANY,\nMANY TIMES IN MANY, MANY SITUATIONS.\nAS WAS MENTIONED, THIS WAS THE VERY FIRST DAY ON THE JOB FOR\nTHE NEW POLICE COMMISSIONER. >> HIS FIRST DAY.\nBECAUSE FRIDAY WAS THE LAST DAY FOR COMMISSIONER BRATTON.\nWE'RE TOLD THAT OBVIOUSLY THE PRESS CONFERENCE WILL BE HELD BY\nTHE NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT. AND I'M WONDERING IF THE NEW\nCOMMISSIONER WILL PROBABLY LEAD THAT PRESS CONFERENCE.\nAGAIN, AS ERROL JUST SAID, IT'S HIS FIRST DAY ON THE JOB AND NOW\nHE'S HAVING TO DEAL WITH THIS. ALSO WE SHOULD SAY AS WE WAIT\nFOR THIS PRESS CONFERENCE AS YOU WERE ON THE AIR THIS EVENING WE\nTALKED ABOUT THIS A LITTLE EARLIER, THE EXPLOSION AT THE\nJERSEY SHORE AND NOW THIS. COINCIDENCE?\nWE'RE NOT SURE. WE SUPPOSE POSED THAT QUESTION\nTO COM FUENTES. TOM, ARE YOU THERE?\nTHESE TWO THINGS HAPPENING ON THE SAME DAY.\nWHAT SHOULD WE MAKE OF THAT? >> UNTIL WE FIND OUT MORE ABOUT\nTHE DEVICES AND OTHER PARTS OF THE INVESTIGATION, IT IS PRETTY\nEARLY TO SPECULATE ON THAT. IT COULD BE A COINCIDENCE.\nIT COULD BE THE SAME PERSON. IT COULD BE A COPYCAT.\nSO AWFUL THESE THINGS ARE POSSIBLE.\nTHERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE MAKING BOMBS OR IN\nPOSSESSION OF EXPLOSIVE DEVICES ALL THE TIME.\nTHIS IS NOT A RARE EVENT, UNFORTUNATELY.\nIT'S JUST A QUESTION OF WHEN THEY DECIDE TO PUT ONE OUT AND\nEXPLODE IT. SO IT COULD BE THAT SOMEBODY\nHEARING ABOUT THE DEVICE IN NEW JERSEY EARLIER TODAY DECIDED\nOKAY, MY TURN AND THEY MAY HAVE DONE THAT.\nOR THEY'LL FIND OUT WHEN THE EXPLOSIVE EXPERTS COMPARE THEIR\nNOTES INTO TONIGHT OR TOMORROW IF THE WIRING'S THE SAME AND IT\nLOOKS LIKE THE SAME PERSON PUT IT TOGETHER THAT WILL CHANGE THE\nASPECT OF THE INVESTIGATION INTO BEING A WIDER CONSPIRACY.\n>> AND TOM, WHAT WE DO KNOW ABOUT THE DEVICE IN NEW JERSEY,\nIN SEASIDE PARK, NEW JERSEY, IS IT WAS ACTUALLY THREE PIPE BOX\nPLACED IN A TRASH CAN ON A TIMER.\n>> AT OR NEAR. >> IF IT IS INDEED A BOMB.\nWE DON'T KNOW THE NEW YORK CITY ONE.\nBUT IN NEW JERSEY IT WAS A PIPE BOMB.\nTHREE OF THEM. AND ONE DETONATED.\n>> WHAT WERE YOU SAYING, TOM? >> I SAID MY SOURCES ARE TELLING\nME THE DEVICE TONIGHT IN NEW YORK CITY IS AN IED.\n>> YEAH. THOSE ARE THE PRELIMINARY --\n>> IT'S ALL JUST MOVING VERY QUICKLY AND OUR SHIMON PROKUPESZ\nREPORTING THEY DID FIND A BIG TOOLBOX RIGHT NEXT TO IT.\nCONSTRUCTION TOOLBOX. THEY'RE TRYING TO DECIPHER WHAT\nIT COULD HAVE BEEN. LET'S GO TO SOMEONE ELSE WHO'S\nON THE SCENE. DAILY BEAST SENIOR EDITOR TIM\nTEEMAN. AS WE AWAIT THIS NYPD PRESS\nCONFERENCE, WHAT ARE YOU SEEING, WHAT ARE YOU HEARING?\n>> ABSOLUTELY. I LIVE IN THE AREA.\nI HEARD A VERY LOUD BANG IN MY APARTMENT AFTER HALF PAST 8:00.\nI CAME OUT TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON.\n23rd AND -- [ INAUDIBLE ]\nWHERE THE EMERGENCY ACTIVITY IS. I SAW A LADY BEING STRETCHERED\nAWAY. I HEARD PEOPLE IN THE CROWD\nSAYING OTHER PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INJURED AND STRETCHERED AWAY.\nAND THERE AS WAS A PERIOD OF SILENCE AMONG THE CROWD.\nHE WE WERE BEING PUSHED BACK MORE.\nTO 23rd AND 6th. WE CAN SEE POLICE AND EMERGENCY\nVEHICLES RANGING ALONG MULTIPLE BLOCKS.\nCERTAINLY THE COMMUNITY I WOULD SAY IS VERY MUTED AND SHOCKED.\nBUT SOMETHING -- WE DON'T KNOW WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED.\nWE'LL KNOW WHEN THE POLICE CONFERENCE HAPPENS AT 23rd AND\n6th. PEOPLE ARE VERY MUTED AND\nSHOCKED AT WHAT POSSIBLY HAS HAPPENED HERE THIS EVENING.\n>> STAND BY. AND I WANT TO UPDATE OUR VIEWERS\nHERE. THIS IS DON LEMON HERE WITH\nPOPPY HARLOW. POPPY AND I ARE COVERING THE\nBREAKING NEWS THAT'S HAPPENING HERE IN MANHATTAN.\nAS YOU CAN SEE ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SCREEN, ACCORDING TO THE\nNEW YORK CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT, 25 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INJURED IN\nAN EXPLOSION IN THE CHELSEA NEIGHBORHOOD OF NEW YORK CITY.\nIT HAPPENED ABOUT 8:30 OR SO THIS EVENING AS THE PRESIDENT\nAND SECRETARY OF STATE -- FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY\nCLINTON WERE AT AN EVENT, CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS IN\nWASHINGTON, D.C. AND WE WERE ON THE AIR LIVE AS\nTHIS WAS HAPPENING. WE'RE GETTING REPORTS FROM A\nCOUNCILMAN WHO IS ON THE SCENE, COUNCILMAN COREY JOHNSON WHO'S\nGOING TO JOIN US NOW. HE'S SAYING ACCORDING TO HIS\nSOURCES THERE ARE 26 PEOPLE WHO ARE INJURED.\nWHAT WE HAVE OFFICIALLY HERE AT CNN IS 25.\n23 COREY SAID MINOR INJURIES. ONE HE SAID IT WAS A MODERATE\nINJURY. AND THEN TWO INJURIES THAT ARE\nUNKNOWN. BUT ALL OF THEM AT THIS POINT\nWHICH IS GOOD NEWS THAT THEY'RE NOT LIFE-THREATENING INJURIES,\nCOREY. CORRECT?\n>> THAT'S WHAT I'M BEING TOLD. THE REPORT THAT WE GOT WAS 23\nMINOR, ONE MODERATE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT ONE MODERATE\nMEANS BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT'S LIFE-THREATENING.\nAND THEY WERE SAYING THERE ARE TWO THAT WERE UNKNOWN.\nBUT WHAT EVERYONE'S SAYING HERE IS THEY'RE SAYING IT WASN'T --\nNONE OF THE INJURIES SEEMED TO BE SUPER SERIOUS, THANK GOD.\n>> AGAIN, THIS HAPPENED ABOUT 8:30.\nYOU SAID YOU WERE NEAR THE AREA. >> I WAS ON 23rd STREET AND 9th\nAVENUE LEAVING DINNER WITH A FRIEND.\nWALKING TOWARD 8th AVENUE JUST AFTER THIS HAPPENED MAYBE THREE\nOR FOUR MINUTES AFTER IT HAPPENED.\nTHEN I SAW A SERIES OF FIRE TRUCKS, UNDERCOVER POLICE\nVEHICLES, MARKED POLICE VEHICLES ALL RUSHING TO THE SCENE.\nAMBULANCES. I CAME OVER TO 23rd AND 7th.\nRIGHT WHEN THEY WERE SORT OF BLOCKADING 7th AVENUE.\nAND IT WAS SORT OF JUST AFTER IT HAPPENED.\nTHEY BLOCKED OFF 7th AVENUE, BLOCKED OFF 23rd STREET.\nTHEY STARTED MAKING A LARGER PERIMETER ON 7th AVENUE, ON 6th\nAVENUE. I'VE BEEN HERE FOR THE LAST\nCOUPLE OF HOURS. >> HOW FAR ARE YOU FROM THIS\nPRESS CONFERENCE? >> I'M AT 23rd AND 6th.\nI'M WITH A COUPLE OTHER ELECTED OFFICIALS.\nGALE BREWER AND THE STATE SENATOR.\nAND WE'RE WAITING FOR THE MAYOR, WHO IS BEING BRIEFED RIGHT NOW.\n>> STAND BY, CONGRESSMAN. THANK YOU SO MUCH.\nI WANT TO LET OUR VIEWERS KNOW THAT WE HAVE LEARNED THE\nPRESIDENT, PRESIDENT OBAMA, HAS BEEN BRIEFED ON THE SITUATION,\nON THE EXPLOSION IN NEW YORK CITY ACCORDING TO THE WHITE\nHOUSE. HE WILL BE UPDATED AS MORE\nINFORMATION IS AVAILABLE. WE'VE ALSO LEARNED JUST MOMENTS\nAGO THAT HILLARY CLINTON, SECRETARY HILLARY CLINTON TOLD\nABOUT THIS EXPLOSION SHORTLY AFTER SHE LEFT THE STAGE AT THE\nCONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS DINNER IN WASHINGTON, D.C.\nTONIGHT. SHE WAS BRIEFED.\nPER AN AIDE SHE WAS TOLD ABOUT THE NEW YORK EXPLOSION SHORTLY\nAFTER THOSE REMARKS TONIGHT. AND WE'RE ALSO TOLD THAT THE\nSECRETARY INSTRUCTED HER STAFF TO PROVIDE UPDATES AS THE\nSITUATION DEVELOPS. AGAIN JUST UPDATING YOU ON OUR\nBREAKING NEWS. DON LEMON AND I ARE HERE\nCOVERING FOR YOU TONIGHT. AN EXPLOSION AROUND 8:40 P.M.\nTONIGHT IN THE CHELSEA NEIGHBORHOOD OF MANHATTAN AT\n23rd STREET AND 6th AVENUE. A VERY BUSY END OF SUMMER\nSATURDAY NIGHT WITH PEOPLE OUT AND ABOUT.\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE VEHICLES COMING IN DROVES, MORE THAN  NI\nTHIS HOUR, WE KNOW THAT THERE WAS AN EXPLOSION, GAS HAS BEEN\nRULED OUT, PRELIMINARY REPORTS OF AN IED, BUT AS SIMONE IS\nREPORTING, IT COULD HAVE BEEN SOMETHING ELSE AND WE'RE WAITING\nFOR THE -- WE DON'T KNOW, WE'RE WAITING FOR THE MAYOR AND THE\nHEAD OF THE NYPD, JAMES O'NEILL, ON HIS FIRST DAY ON THE JOB.\n>> WHICH IS INTERESTING, AND NEW YORK MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO, AS\nYOU HEARD CORY SAY, HE HAD BEEN BRIEFED BY THE MANHATTAN BUREAU\nPRESIDENT, HE'S BEING BRIEFED. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT\nOUT TOO THAT THIS IS A SITUATION THAT THEY NO DOUBT TAKE\nSERIOUSLY, POPPY, THE NYPD AS INCREASED POLICE PRESENCE ALL\nOVER THE FIVE BOROUGHS OF MANHATTAN.\nAND THE COUNTER TERRORISM UNIT MONITORING THE SITUATION IN\nCHELSEA. THE COUNT THAT WE HAVE, 25\nINJURED, DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE LIFE THREATENING, ALTHOUGH WE'RE\nGETTING SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT NUMBERS FROM CORRIE JOHNSON WHO\nIS A NEW YORK COUNCILMAN. >> I WANT TO BRING LEWIS BACK\nIN, SOMEONE WHO COVERS NEW YORK CITY, NOT ONLY POLITICS, BUT NEW\nYORK CITY IN GENERAL, AND YOUR STUDIO IS LOCATED NOT VERY FAR\nFROM WHERE THIS OCCURRED IN CHELSEA.\nONE THING THAT IS INTERESTING, I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE THOSE LIVE\nPICTURES THAT WE CAN BRING UP ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCREEN.\nTHERE YOU GO, PEOPLE ARE GOING ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS, IN NEW\nYORK, YOU'VE GOT SOME EMERGENCY RESPONSE VEHICLES, A LOT OF THEM\nTHERE. BUT PEOPLE ARE CROSSING THE\nSTREET, YOU SEE SOME WITH THEIR CHILDREN, AS FAR AS WE KNOW, THE\nSUBWAYS ARE STILL UP AND RUNNING.\n>> THIS IS THE NEW YORK SPORTS CLUB.\n>> THIS IS EQUIVALENT TO ABOUT FIVE BLOCKS OR SO AWAY.\nTHIS IS NEW YORK, THEY DO NOT SHUT DOWN BIG CHUNKS OF NEW\nYORK, EVEN AFTER SOMETHING LIKE THIS.\n>> THE CITY NEVER SLEEPS, AND THE SUBWAYS ARE NOT SHUT DOWN,\nIT TAKES A COUPLE OF HOURS AND A LOT OF WORK TO SHUT DOWN THE NEW\nYORK SUBWAY. A LOT OF THOSE CARS, THOSE\nPEOPLE YOU SEE WALKING, THEY'RE NOT HANGING OUT, THEY'RE GOING\nTO WORK. SOMEBODY'S GOT TO MAKE IS\nDOUGHNUTS FOR THE BRUNCH TOMORROW.\nTHERE'S A LOT THAT ALWAYS GOES ON AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE\nSTREETS THAT ARE IN A GRID PATTERN, MEANS THAT AS HAPPENED\nHERE, IF YOU SECTION OFF THE AREA THAT YOU WANT, LIKE THIS\nSECTION OF 23rd STREET, THERE'S NO PARTICULAR REASON TO\nINCONVENIENCE EVERYBODY ELSE. THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE ON THAT\nBLOCK ARE GOING TO HAVE A HARD TIME GETTING TO WHERE THEY WANT\nTO GO. EVERYBODY ELSE WILL IN FACT BE\nABLE TO GET AROUND. AND IT'S CONSIDERED ONE OF THE\nTHINGS THAT THE NYPD DOES WELL IN ORDER TO KEEP EVERYBODY CALM,\nIS TO NOT SUDDENLY INCONVENIENCE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF 35PEOPLE.\nTHAT'S WHEN IT FEELS LIKE AN EMERGENCY, IF THEY'RE SEPARATED\nFROM THEIR MEDICINE, FROM THEIR PETS, THEIR KIDS, THAT SORT OF\nTHING. >> PEOPLE SAY THIS IS A\nRESIDENTIAL AREA, A INDUSTRIAL AREA, IT'S A MIXED USE\nNEIGHBORHOOD, YOU MAY LIVE ABOVE A RESTAURANT OR A DRY-CLEANER\nCOULD BE THERE. EVERYTHING HAPPENS IN THIS AREA,\nYOU SAW THE CHELSEA CINEMA THAT'S ON THE CORNER.\nTHERE'S A GYM THERE, THERE'S A BBQ RIGHT ON THE CORNER.\nAND THERE'S A 24-HOUR DELI THAT'S ON THE CORNER OF 8th AND\n23rd. AND WHERE HAROLD LEWIS IS\nLOCATED, CHELSEA MARKET, WITH SHOPS, AND ALL TYPES OF\nBUSINESSES. AND AROUND THERE, RESIDENCES,\nHOMES, NOT THAT ANY NEIGHBORHOOD IS NOT UP AND COMING IN NEW YORK\nCITY, BUT THIS IS REALLY A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT IS UNDERGOING\nA RENAISSANCE, THE PRICES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD ARE GOING UP VERY\nQUICKLY. BUT AGAIN, IF INDEED TURNS OUT\nTO BE TARGETED, WHY THIS PARTICULAR NEIGHBORHOOD WAS\nTARGETED? >> THAT'S RIGHT, THERE'S NOT\nSOME SORT OF BIG -- YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT -- THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE\nOR THE WORLD TRADE CENTER OR THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE OR SOME\nICONIC LANDMARK THERE AT ALL. >> IT'S NOT IN THAT PARTICULAR\nAREA. >> JUST TO UPDATE OUR VIEWERS,\nWE ARE WAITING FOR A PRESS CONFERENCE THERE, WE'LL HEAR\nFROM NEW YORK CITY MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO, AND WE'LL HEAR FROM THE\nNEW YORK CITY POLICE CHIEF WHO'S FIRST DAY ON THE JOB.\nSO FAR WE HAVE LEARNED 25 PEOPLE INJURED IN THIS EXPLOSION, THE\nCAUSE OF IT UNKNOWN, GAS HAS BEEN RULED OUT AND WE DO KNOW\nTHAT ALL OF THOSE INJURIES AT THIS POINT WE'RE TOLD ARE\nNONLIFE THREATENING. >> YEAH, IT WILL BE INTERESTING\nTO HEAR WHAT JIMMY O'NEIL, WHO'S THE NEW NYPD COMMISSIONER, HE'S\nCERTAINLY NOT NEW TO THE NEW YORK CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT, SO\nHE IS CERTAINLY USED TO DEALING WITH THIS PARTICULAR SITUATIONS\nOF THIS MAGNITUDE AND EVEN GREATER HERE IN NEW YORK CITY.\nAND IF ANY CITY IS PREPARED TO DEAL WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS,\nIT'S NEW YORK CITY HAVING DEALT WITH 9/11 AND MANY OTHER\nTERRIBLE INCIDENTS THAT HAVE",

              "text": "GOTTEN CLOSER TO US.\nBUT THIS IS A CRIME SCENE. DESIGNATED AS INTENTIONAL CRIME\nTHAT WAS DONE. AT THIS POINT WE BELIEVE THEY'RE\nPROCESSING IT. THEY DO HAVE VIDEO FROM THE\nSCENE AND ARE CURRENTLY COLLECTING MORE BUT IT'S TOO\nEARLY TO GIVE OUT ANY DETAILS. MOST THEY WOULD SAY IS IT WAS\nEXPLOSION AND ALSO IT WAS OUTSIDE OF A DUMPSTER, A TRASH\nCAN, RECEPTACLE OF SOME TYPE. BEYOND THAT WOULD NOT SAY ANY\nMORE DETAILS. OF COURSE THEY ARE ALSO NOW AT\nSECONDARY SCENE AT 27th STREET, TO MY LEFT, A FEW BLOCKS UP\nBETWEEN 6th AND 7th, WOULDN'T DELINEATE WHAT'S HAPPENING\nTHERE. AT THIS POINT WE DON'T THINK\nTHERE'S BEEN AN EXPLOSION, THEY SAID IT HAPPENED AT ABOUT 8:30\nTONIGHT AND FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS IN THE VICINITY, DIDN'T SEE BUT\nHEARD IT. ALL HANDS ON TECH IS HAPPENING\nRIGHT NOW. WERE THERE IMMEDIATELY AFTER\nTHIS HAPPENED BUT WAITING TO SEE IF WE CAN GET ANY MORE DETAILS\nRIGHT NOW. BUT ACTIVE CRIME SCENE THEY'RE\nPROCESSING. LOOKING AT OTHER PARTS OF THE\nCITY TO SEE IF ANYTHING ELSE IS HAPPENING OR ANYTHING THEY CAN\nPREVENT BUT AT THIS POINT ON THE SCENE WAITING FOR DETAILS.\n>> THANK YOU JEAN. >> WE'RE GOING TO TAKE YOU TO\nTHE SECOND SITE IN JUST A MOMENT ARE RICHARD QWEST IS.\nAND BRING IN EVAN. HELP US DECIPHER WHAT WE\nLEARNED. MAYOR SAID NO CONNECTION TO\nTERRORISM BUT INTENTIONAL. TOM FUENTES AS DON AND I WERE\nSPEAKING WITH HIM SAID HE CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WOULD SAY NO\nTERRORISM CONNECTION ALREADY YET KNOW IT'S INTENTIONAL.\nWHAT ARE YOUR SOURCES SAYING? >> Reporter: FOLKS I'M TALKING\nTO, IT'S WAY TOO EARLY TO MAKE ANY STATEMENT ABOUT WHETHER OR\nNOT THERE IS OR ISN'T TERRORISM. I THINK THE MAYOR IS TRYING TO\nREASSURE THE CITIZENS OF NEW YORK CITY.\n  THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE AND HE'S A POLITICIAN, BUT NOTICE YOU\nDIDN'T HEAR THAT FROM THE NEW YORK POLICE KMIRGS.\nTHEY'RE TRYING TO FIRST FIGURE OUT WHAT THIS IS AND SEE WHETHER\nOR NOT IT'S RELATED TO THE OTHER DEVICE FOUND JUST ABOUT FOUR\nBLOCKS AWAY ON 27th STREET. ONE OF THE THINGS THEY'RE TRYING\nTO SEE PERHAPS IS LOOKED LIKE SIMILAR TYPE OF DEVICE.\nIT'S INTERESTING THEY REFRAINED FROM USING THE WORD DEVICE.\nSOME SOURCES HAVE TOLD US IT APPEARS TO BE IED BUT THE MAYOR\nAND POLICE COMMISSIONER AT PRESS CONFERENCE WERE RELUCTANT TO GO\nTHERE JUST YET, WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT BOMB SQUAD HAS THE\nTIME TO PUT TOGETHER WHAT IT IS. IT'S INTERESTING CALLING IT\nINTENTIONAL, AS YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT, THEY'VE GOT\nTO HAVE SOME REASON TO BE USING THAT SPECIFIC LANGUAGE.\nONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT COMES TO MIND IS THEY DID\nMENTION THEY HAVE VIDEO OF THE EXPLOSION WHICH VERY LIKELY\nMEANS THEY WOULD HAVE A VERY GOOD PICTURE OF EVERYBODY WHO\nHAS NEAR THAT SCENE IN THE HOURS BEFORE THIS EXPLOSION HAPPENED.\nTHAT MEANS THEY MIGHT HAVE SEEN SOMEBODY DROPPING IT THERE OR\nLEAVING SOMETHING BEHIND OR HAVE A SUSPICION OF WHO THEY MIGHT BE\nLOOKING FOR. THAT'S VERY MUCH WHAT MAKES THEM\nBELIEVE THIS IS INTENTIONAL ACT. IF YOU HAVE VIDEO OF THE\nEXPLOSION, IT'S LIKELY YOU'LL HAVE VIDEO IF SOMEONE LEFT\nSOMETHING THERE TO CAUSE THE EXPLOSION.\nTHIS IS ALL VERY EARLY IN THE PROCESS.\nI THINK WE'LL BE WORKING THIS ALL NIGHT UNTIL WE HEAR\nOFFICIALLY WHAT EXACTLY THE CAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION WAS.\n>> ALL RIGHT EVAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nSTAND BY. ALL OF OUR CORRESPONDENTS AND\nPRODUCERS ARE IN THE FIELD AND WORKING THE SITUATION\nTIRELESSLY. BE ON THE AIR CONTINUOUSLY UNTIL\nIT'S WARRANTED. YOU MENTIONED A SECOND SCENE AT\n27th AND 6th. THAT'S WHERE RICHARD QUEST IS,\nWHO REPORTED EARLIER. YOU SAW A NUMBER OF LAW\nENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS THERE TELLING YOU TO GET BACK AND\nCORDONED OFF THE AREA. WHAT IS GOING ON THERE NOW?\nRICHARD QUEST, ARE YOU THERE? >> Reporter: YES I BEG YOUR\nPARDON DON, CAN YOU HEAR ME? >> I CAN.\nUPDATE US. >> Reporter: NOISY.\nDO APOLOGIZE DON. WE'RE ON 27th STREET AND 7th\nAVENUE. THIS IS THE LOCATION, 27th\nBETWEEN 6th AND 7th, THE LOCATION OF WHERE THE SECOND\nSUPPOSED IED OR DEVICE, WHATEVER WE WANT TO CALL IT, HAS BEEN\nLOCATED. WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST TEN\nOR 15 MINUTES IS A BOMB OR DEVICE CONTAINMENT CONTRAPTION,\nA LARGE CIRCULAR ON THE BACK OF A TRUCK BROUGHT IN BY THE\nPOLICE, BACKED DOWN 27th STREET AND THEN HURRIEDLY LEFT SHORTLY\nTHEREAFTER. WE DON'T KNOW AND THEY HAVEN'T\nCONFIRMED HAD A THEY PUT INTO THE CONTAINMENT DEVICE OR IF\nTHEY LEFT WITH ANYTHING AT ALL BUT WITHIN SHORT ORDER OF THAT\nENORMOUS FIRE BRIGADE EFFORT COMING IN, HOSE PIPES AND STUN\nPIPES ACTIVATED. THAT'S THE SITUATION.\nIN THE AREA AROUND HERE NEAR THE F.I.T., THE ENTIRE PERIMETER OF\nTHE CORDON FOR SECURITY HAS BEEN WIDENED SIGNIFICANTLY.\nPEOPLE HAVE BEEN TOLD TO STAY IN DORM BUILDINGS.\nNOT EVACUATED BY LOUD SPEAKERS TELLING PEOPLE TO STAY IN THE\nBUILDINGS. >> IN THAT AREA STAY IN THE\nBUILDINGS, RICHARD HERE IS THE THING.\nEARLIER SAW ONE OF THE ROBOTIC DEVICES THAT THEY SEND IN TO\nIDENTIFY OR DETONATE WHATEVER DEVICE IT IS.\nDID YOU SEE THAT? YOU SAW CONTAINMENT DEVICE, NOT\nTHE ROBOT THAT GOES IN CORRECT? >> Reporter: NO.\nIF YOU LOOK DOWN THE ROAD THERE, YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE BLUE AND\nRED AND VERY BRIGHT RED LIGHTS ARE.\nTHAT IS THE SCENE WHERE THEY HAVE THE FOCUS, LOCUS IF YOU\nLIKE OF ATTENTION. SO WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SEE\nWHAT'S BEEN TAKING PLACE IN THAT AREA.\nBUT WE DID SEE THE CONTAINMENT MACHINE ARRIVE.\nIT IS BASICALLY DRAGGED IN ON THE BACK OF A LARGE LOW LOADER,\nTARPAULIN THEN REMOVED AND IT WAS BACKED IN.\nWE DON'T KNOW AND THEY HAVEN'T CONFIRMED IF THEY DID PUT A\nDEVICE INTO IT WHEN THEY TOOK IT AWAY.\nAS YOU CAN SEE -- YES? >> GOOD INDICATION WOULD BE WHEN\nTHEY MOVED THIS DEVICE OUT, DID THEY CLEAR EVERYBODY OUT OF THE\nAREA WHEN THEY MOVED THE DEVICE OUT?\n>> Reporter: THE AREA HAS ALREADY BEEN CLEARED, DON.\nWE'RE CLOSER TO THIS SCENE OR POSITION IF YOU LIKE THAN WE\nWERE AT 23rd STREET AND 6th. WE'RE FOUR OR FIVE BLOCKS\nFURTHER NORTH THAN THAT. THIS AREA CAME AS A COMPLETE\nSURPRISE, HAVING HAD TWO OR THREE HOURS WITH THE ATTENTION\nFOCUSED AROUND 23rd STREETMENT THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN IT BECAME\nCLEAR THERE WAS SOMETHING TAKING PLACE AT 27th STREET.\nI CAN TELL YOU BECAUSE I'VE SEEN IT WITH MY OWN EYES THE POLICE\nHAVE BEEN COMBING THESE STREETS EVER SINCE.\nWITH FLASHLIGHTS LOOKING UNDER CARS IN DUMPSTERS, IN TRASH\nCANS, DOORWAYS. THEY'VE NO REASON TO BELIEVE\nTHERE'S ANY OTHER DEVICES BUT THEY'RE LEAVING NOTHING TO\nCHANCE TONIGHT DON, DOING A FULL-SCALE SEARCH IN THIS AREA\nTO MAKE SURE IT REMAINS OR IS SAFE.\n>> DON'T GO ANYWHERE, GOING TO TALK TO FOLKS WHO MAY HAVE\nQUESTIONS FOR YOU. >> Reporter: OF COURSE.\n>> TOM FUENTES IS BACK WITH US, CNN ANALYST AND FORMER FBI\nASSISTANT DIRECTOR WITH LOTS OF EXPERIENCE AND ALSO JULIET\nKAYUM. TO YOU, RICHARD QUEST SAID THIS\nAREA HAS LARGELY BEEN CLEARED OUT BUT THAT DEVICE THAT HE\nDESCRIBED GOING IN ON THE BACK OF THE TRUCK, CAN YOU TALK TO US\nMORE ABOUT WHAT THAT WOULD BE BROUGHT INTO A SCENE LIKE THIS\nFOR? >> BASICALLY TO ISOLATE ANY\nPOTENTIAL OTHER DEVICES. ONCE AGAIN I'M CAREFUL WITH THE\nTERM DEVICE BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW IF A DEVICE OR\nSOMETHING ELSE. THEY'VE CLEARLY FOUND SOMETHING\nTHEY'RE NERVOUS ENOUGH ABOUT THEY WANT OUT OF A VERY DENSE\nAREA. THIS IS USUAL.\nAND ONCE AGAIN, JUST PUTTING THIS IN PERSPECTIVE.\nAFTER EVERY INCIDENT THERE WILL BE ABOUT A HALF DOZEN TO A DOZEN\nFALSE POSITIVE REPORTS. WE'RE SEEING THIS IN REAL TIME\nAND RICHARD IS REPORTING ON IT. MIGHT BE MULTIPLE ONES OF THESE\nOVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS. IT ALWAYS HAPPENS AND THIS IS\nWHAT WE WANT FROM OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIRST RESPONDERS\nIS FOR THEM TO BE OVERINCLUSIVE. THE ONE THING RICHARD I WANTED\nTO ASK, I THINK YOU AND I KNOW AND CAN DESCRIBE CHELSEA AND THE\nAREA. VERY VIBRANT, DIVERSE, WELCOMING\nTO DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES INCLUDING THE GUY COMMUNITY.\nWHERE EXACT -- I'M CURIOUS, ARE THERE BARS AROUND THERE, EXACTLY\nWHAT IS IT LIKE IN TERMS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD RIGHT THERE?\n>> DID YOU HEART QUESTION RICHARD?\n>> Reporter: FORGIVE ME I DIDN'T.\nREPEAT IT. >> WE KNOW BECAUSE WE'RE\nNEW YORKERS EXACTLY WHAT'S IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND WHAT IT'S\nLIKE AND NEIGHBORHOOD IS WELCOMING TO A DIVERSE VARIETY\nOF PEOPLE. INCLUDING THE GUY COMMUNITY.\nSHE'S WONDERING IF THERE ARE BARS, WHAT IS IN THE AREA, BARS\nOR RESTAURANTS. DESCRIBE THE AREA.\n>> Reporter: ABSOLUTELY. 23rd STREET IS IN THE HEART OF\nCHELSEA. THE GYM I USED TO GO TO FUNNILY\nENOUGH IS ON THAT STREET. I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THIS DEVICE\nWAS PLANTED OPPOSITE THE GARDEN OF EDEN GROCERY STORE.\nTHE AREA IS ECLECTIC, A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF THE GUY POPULATION\nBUT TRUTH IS PRICES HAVE RISEN IN THE AREA DRAMATICALLY SO MUCH\nMORE GENTRAIFIED AND GENERAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY.\nIT IS HIP AND DIFFERENT AND NOT AS BOHEMIAN AS PREVIOUS TIMES\nBUT NO DOUBT CHELSEA -- DZ ALSO ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE AREAS\nIN THE CITY NOW BECAUSE OF THE INFLUX OF SERIOUS MONEY.\nBUT STILL VERY MUCH REGARDED AS BEING THE GUY COMMUNITY, THERE\nARE STILL GUY GAY BARS DOWN MIRROR, EXTREMELY BIG NIGHT\nLIFE. >> BUT NEITHER OF THE TWO SCENES\nNOT ANYTHING CLOSE, ESPECIALLY BBQ, LOT OF GAY PEOPLE HANGING\nOUT. BUT NO SPECIFIC GAY BARS OR\nANYTHING THAT COULD LEAD TO MAYBE A POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE\nWOULD TARGET THOSE TWO AREAS? >> Reporter: NO.\nYOU WOULDN'T HIT 23rd STREET IN THAT PARTICULAR PLACE IF THAT\nWAS -- MY GUT FEELING SAYS IF THAT WASSY YOU ARE TARGET.\nAS YOU KNOW DON. 23rd STREET, FULL OF YOUNG\nPEOPLE. NOISY, MOVIES, RESTAURANTS,\nBARS. IF YOU WERE GOING TO AIM\nSPECIFICALLY MORE FOR THE GAY COMMUNITY MORE ACROSS TOWARDS\n8th AVENUE OR UP TOWARDS HELL'S KITCHEN WHERE YOU FIND MOST OF\nTHE GAY BARS RATHER THAN 23rd STREET.\nJUST TO BRING YOU UP TO DATE BRIEFLY.\nWE'RE STARTING TO SEE SLIGHTLESSLY LESS POLICE ACTION\nBUT THEY'RE CONTINUING TO MOVE THE CORDON FURTHER.\nDOGS BEING BROUGHT IN, CONTINUING THIS DETAILED SEARCH\nOF THE AREA TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NOTHING ELSE THAT NEEDS TO BE\nMONITORED. TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA DON TO WHAT\nYOU WERE SAYING BUILDING NEXT TO WHERE I AM IS F.I.T., THE MAJOR\nFASHION INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, FASHION UNIVERSITY IN MANHATTAN,\nONE OF THE WORLD FAMOUS FASHION COLLEGES.\nTHAT'S THE AREA WHERE WE ARE. 7th AVENUE, 27th STREET.\n>> AND YOU'RE RIGHT. WOULD BE CLOSER TO 8th AVENUE\nAND FURTHER SOUTH IF TARGETING THAT COMMUNITY.\nJULIET, DID THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION?\n>> IT DID. FOR SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO -- ONCE\nAGAIN CAN'T RUSH TO JUDGMENT. I KNOW THAT'S THE INCLINATION\nBUT JUST TO GIVE PEOPLE A SENSE OF THE FEEL OF THAT CHELSEA AREA\nTHAT THOSE OF US -- I DON'T LIVE IN NEW YORK, KNOW THE FEEL OF\nIT. BUT U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY IS\nTHIS WEEK. FACT THAT THE RESPONSE WAS SO\nSTRONG IS BOTH BECAUSE OF FEARS OF ALL THESE VIPs IN AND AROUND\nNEW YORK CITY NEEDING TO PROTECT THEM BUT ALSO EVERYONE IS ON\nHIGH ALERT FOR THAT.

GENERAL ASSEMBLY AND OTHER THINGS ARE\nOCCURRING, I HAVE BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE THERE'S PROBABLY MORE\nINFORMATION ABOUT WHO MAY HAVE DONE THAT.\n>> AND PRESIDENT IS ALSO HERE. >> EXACTLY.\nRICHARD ARE YOU STILL WITH US? >> Reporter: I AM INDEED.\nJUST POINT OUT, IN I LAST FEW MOMENTS SEEN ATF PEOPLE.\nALCOHOL, TOBACCO AND FIREARMS.

CITY OFFICIALS SAY THEY DON'T\nBELIEVE IT'S ACT OF TERROR AT THIS POINT OR CONNECTED TO\nANOTHER EXPLOSION IN NEW JERSEY EARLIER TODAY.\nSAY THERE'S NO CREDIBLE THREAT BUT DO BELIEVE IT'S INTENTIONAL\nACT. >> JEAN CASARES HAS BEEN ON THE\nLOCATION. JOINING FROM THE INTERSECTION.\nJEAN IMPORTANT QUESTION. THIS IS A LARGELY RESIDENTIAL\nAREA, OBVIOUSLY BUSINESSES AROUND, RESTAURANTS ET CETERA.\nTHERE ARE A LOT OF APARTMENT BUILDINGS HERE.\nMY QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT ANY OF THE RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN\nEVACUATED OR CONVERSELY TOLD TO STAY INSIDE OF THOSE BUILDINGS.\n>> Reporter: WE'RE BEING TOLD THAT ALL OF NEW YORK CITY IS\nTOLD TO BE VIGILANT AT THIS POINT AND WE ARE NOT BEING TOLD\nHOWEVER WHAT WAS AROUND THAT DUMPSTER.\nTHEY'RE SAYING THEY'RE INVESTIGATING NOW WHETHER THE\nEXPLOSION TOOK PLACE INSIDE, OUTSIDE, WE HEARD OUTSIDE OF THE\nDUMPSTER WHICH CORRELATES WITH THE INJURIES.\n29 WE WERE TOLD AT PRESS CONFERENCE.\nNEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT IS NOW SAYING 27 INJURIES.\nBUT HEARING A LOT OF SIRENS. I THINK YOU JUST HEARD ONE GO\nBY. HEARD MORE SIRENS AND SEEING\nMORE AMBULANCES GO BY WHERE I AM ON 23rd STREET ABOUT A BLOCK\nAWAY FROM WHERE THAT CRIME SCENE, ACTIVE CRIME SCENE AND\nINVESTIGATION IS GOING ON. MAYOR OF THE CITY SAID AT THIS\nPOINT THERE IS NO INDICATION AT ALL THIS IS AN ASPECT OF TERROR,\nYET WE ALSO HEARD IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE THAT ALL TERROR UNITS\nARE ON THE SCENE. ALL HANDS ON DECK FROM THE\nFEDERAL PARTNERS TO THE LOCAL TO THE STATE.\nALL ARE HERE RIGHT NOW AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT THE SCENE IS\nREALLY STATIONARY. EMERGENCY VEHICLES ARE GOING\nNOWHERE. PEOPLE OF NEW YORK CITY OUT AND\nABOUT ON SATURDAY NIGHT STILL STANDING HERE, EVERYONE WAITING\nFOR UPDATE TO SEE WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT IN ALL OF THIS.\n>> JUST TO BE CLEAR JEAN, NO ONE EVACUATED FROM THE RESIDENTIAL\nBUILDINGS AT THIS TIME THAT YOU KNOW OF?\n>> Reporter: NOT THAT WE KNOW OF BUT ALSO NOT TOLD TAGTLY WHAT\nWAS AROUND THAT AREA. >> GOOD POINT.\nAS WE GET JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT EVAN PEREZ BACK, TAKE A LOOK AT\nVIDEO. NEW VIDEO IN SHOWING POLICE\nOFFICERS GOING AROUND TO THE TRASH CANS.\nIT'S HARD TO SEE HERE BUT ON THE CORNERS SEARCHING TRASH CANS\nWITH FLASHLIGHTS. >> AS RICHARD QUEST FIRST\nREPORTED, GOING FROM LOOKING UNDER CARS, NOT ONLY IN TRASH\nCANS BUT UNDER CARS. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT\nOUT BECAUSE THEY SAID THERE WAS NO CONNECTION HERE.\nIF THERE ISN'T INDEED A CONNECTION, MEANS TWO PEOPLE\nPLANTED BOMBS CLOSE TO NEW YORK CITY AND NEW JERSEY BUT OUT OF\nALL OF THIS, 29 PEOPLE ARE INJURED.\nTHAT'S A HECK OF A LOT OF PEOPLE AND AS WE LEARNED FROM THE PRESS\nCONFERENCE ONE PERSON IN SERIOUS CONDITION RIGHT NOW FROM A\nPUNCTURE WOUND FROM WHAT ONE WOULD ASSUME IS FROM SHRAPNEL OR\nSOMETHING FROM THE BOMB. SAID THE BOMB PLACED OUTSIDE,\nEXPLODED OUTSIDE ON THE STREET AT THE INITIAL LOCATION THEY'RE\nLOOKING AT IN, NOTHING EXPLODED AT OTHER.\nONE LOCATION, 23rd AND 6th IS THE INITIAL LOCATION WHERE THE\nBOMB EXPLODE OUTSIDE OF THIS FACILITY FOR THE BLIND.\n>> EXACTLY. IN A LARGELY RESIDENTIAL AREA.\nTON OF HIGH RISE BUILDINGS AND HOUSE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LIVE\nTHERE. EVAN, IT'S INTERESTING THEY SAID\nTHEY HAVE VIDEO OF THE EXPLOSION AND IT'S INTENTIONAL BUT DIDN'T\nSAY WITH A EXPLODE. WHY?\n>> Reporter: THEY DIDN'T SAY WHAT KIND OF DWIECHLTS I THINK\nWHAT HAPPENED IS IF YOU HAVE A DEVICE THAT EXPLODED AND NOT\nMUCH OF IT SURVIVED, THAT'S ONE OF THE ASPECTS THAT IS PROBABLY\nPREVENTING THEM FROM BEING SO DECLARATIVE OF WHAT EXACTLY\nHAPPENED, WHAT CAUSED IT. DID MAKE REFERENCE TO A POSSIBLE\nSECOND DEVICE NOW BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE NYPD.\nDON'T NOPE EXACTLY WHAT THAT IS TURNING OUT TO BE BUT AS RICHARD\nPOINTED OUT, A BOMB CONTAINMENT UNIT BROUGHT TO THE SCENE AND\nIT'S CLEAR THEY'RE TAKING THAT DEVICE AND GOING TO EXAMINE IT\nTO SEE WHAT IT IS. AND WHETHER IT'S THE SAME THING\nTHAT HAPPENED EARLIER. ONE OF THE THINGS YOU KEEP MAKE\nREFERENCE TO IS THE MAYOR CATEGORICALLY SAYING,\nDISCOUNTING THE POSSIBILITY OF TERRORISM.\nI THINK IT'S A LITTLE EARLY FOR HIM TO SAY THAT.\nCERTAINLY AS YOU SEE THE SCENES OF THE OFFICERS GOING THROUGH\nDIFFERENT PARTS OF THE CITY LOOKING FOR POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL\nDWIESZ, I THINK SOMETHING HAS THEM EXTREMELY WORRIED AT THIS\nSTAGE. IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT IN NEW YORK\nCITY, STREETS ARE PACKED WITH PEOPLE AND EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE\nTHE SCENE DOWN IN CHELSEA, DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE CITY ARE\nSTILL MOVING ON WITH THEIR LIVES.\nPEOPLE STILL ON THE STREETS. PROBABLY EVERY OFFICER OUT THERE\nIS GOING TO BE LOOKING TO SEE IF ANYTHING IS LEFT ON THE STREETS,\nBAGS, ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE A POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL EXPLOSIVE\nDEVICE. THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT\nNOW. >> ALL OF NEW YORK CITY HAS BEEN\nPLACED ON HIGH ALERT THIS EVENING.\nEVAN YOU ARE EXACTLY CORRECT. THIS ALL COMING AT 8:40 IN THE\nEVENING WITH PEOPLE OUT AND ABOUT ENJOYING THEMSELVES.\nWE'VE BEEN SPEAKING AND OUR AFFILIATES, TO PEOPLE THERE AND\nWHO WITNESSED EXPLOSION OR WERE NEARBY.\nHERE'S ONE OF THEM. >> IT SOUNDS LIKE WHEN YOU HEAR\nTHOSE METAL STEEL PLATES, THE ONES THAT ARE AN INCH THICK AND\n20 FOOT BY 10 FOOT AND FLATTENED FULL ON THE GROUND.\nI WAS AN 23rd STREET AND 10th. >> PRETTY FAR AWAY.\n>> THREE BLOCKS. DIDN'T KNOW THAT.\nSOUNDED LIKE A BLOCK AWAY. PRETTY AMAZING.\n>> Reporter: WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH YOUR HEAD WHEN YOU HEARD\nTHERE'S AN EXPLOSION. >> I'M ARCHITECT.\nYOU GET CONCERNED. HEARD ABOUT GAS EXPLOSIONS.\nI LIVED THROUGH 9/11 AND IT'S A CONCERN FOR HUMANITY.\n>> Reporter: TELL ME ABOUT THE SCENE AFTERWARDS.\n>> FIRST RESPONDERS COMING. BLINKING LIGHTS.\nYOU KNOW IT'S FIRST RESPONDERS, LOT OF POLICE AND FIRE TRUCKS.\nEMERGENCY VEHICLES, UNDERCOVER EMERGENCY VEHICLES.\nI SPOKE TO ONE AMBULANCE MAN WHO SAID I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING\nYET. WE'RE STILL INVESTIGATING.\n>> Reporter: WAS IT CHAOTIC OR CALM?\n>> PRETTY CALM. LOT OF PEOPLE AROUND THE CORNER\nBECAUSE STILL VEHICLES SURPRISINGLY, MANY VEHICLES\nSTILL COMING DOWN 23rd STREET THAT THEY HAD TO CLEAR OUT.\nAND AS THEY -- THEN I JUST SAW THE FIRST POLICE CAR BLOCK\nEVERYBODY ON 21st STREET AND GET RID OF ALL THE CARS.\nAFTER THE VEHICLES WERE GONE, YOU SEE PEOPLE CONGREGATING ON\nTHE CORNER. >> Reporter: WERE YOU CONCERNED\nFOR SAFETY KNOWING THIS EXPLOSION JUST HAPPENED THREE\nBLOCKS AWAY FROM YOU AND NOT A LOT OF INFORMATION?\n>> INITIALLY YES. YOU ALWAYS HAVE THAT CONCERN\nBECAUSE DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THREE BLOCKS AWAY OR 100 FEET.\nYOU DON'T KNOW AND THESE DAYS YOU JUST DON'T KNOW.\n>> EYEWITNESS WHO WAS FOUR AVENUES AWAY.\n>> JEAN IS ON THE SCENE AROUND 23rd AND 6th AVENUE.\nBEEN THERE SINCE MOMENTS AFTER IT OCCURRED.\nJEAN YOU'RE SEEING SOME DEVELOPMENT THERE.\nWHAT IS IT? >> Reporter: WE'RE SEEING A LOT\nMORE EMERGENCY VEHICLES GO TOWARD THE CRIME SCENE RIGHT\nNOW. JUST SAW A VERY LARGE UNIT.\nIT APPEARS TO HAVE A STRUCTURE ON THE TOP THAT COULD BE LIGHTS,\nI THINK. OF COURSE IT'S EVENING HERE,\nDARK. BUT IT JUST CAME ON 23rd STREET\nTO GO TOWARD WHERE THAT AREA IS ABOUT A BLOCK AWAY.\nAN ACTIVE CRIME SCENE AT THIS HOUR.\nEXPECT IT TO BE LIKE THIS ALL EVENING.\nBUT THEY'RE PROCESSING THE CRIME SCENE, THEY'RE COLLECTING MORE\nVIDEO. WE WERE TOLD THEY HAD VIDEO AT\nTHE TIME THE EXPLOSION HAPPENED BUT THEY'RE IN THE PROCESS OF\nCOLLECTING MORE. MORE UNITS GOING IN.\nOBVIOUSLY THIS IS GETTING A BIT MORE INTOENTS INVESTIGATIVE\nANSWER OF THIS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO FIND OUT ANSWERS OF THIS,\nWHAT IT IS, WHAT IT IS COMPOSED OF AND UNITS AROUND THE CITY --\nONE THING I WANTED TO SAY, I HEARD IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE\nCOULD HAVE BEEN A SLIP OF THE TONGUE BUT ON 27th INVESTIGATION\nBETWEEN 6th AND 7th IT WAS REFERRED TO AS DEVICE.\nCOULD HAVE BEEN A SLIP OF THE TONGUE.\nTHEY WOULD TO THE EXPLAIN. THIS IS NOT THE TIME OR PLACE\nTHEY SAID TO EXPLAIN WHAT THEY MEANT BY THE STATEMENT BUT WORD\nDEVICE WAS USED IN REGARD TO 27th STREET.\n>> YOU PICKED UP ON THAT JEAN, VERY SAVVY OF YOU AND ALSO SAID\nTHE STREET WAS CLEARED WHICH IS AN INDICATION THAT THERE MAY",

IT WAS WARMER EARLIER.\nAND THIS IS THE CHELSEA AREA, A VERY POPULAR AREA IN NEW YORK\nCITY. BUT THIS IS ALSO AN AREA,\nESPECIALLY 23rd STREET HERE WHERE THERE ARE BUSINESSES\nCLOSED AT THIS TIME. THERE ARE SOME RESIDENTIAL BUT\nIT'S NOT AS ACTIVE AS OTHER AREAS THAT WE DO KNOW.\nAND 27th STREET THE SAME THING, THE SECONDARY DEVICE LOCATION WE\nARE TOLD.

BUT I CAN TELL RIGHT HERE THEY\nNEVER TOLD US -- WE CAN'T GET TO WHERE THAT DUMPSTER SITE IS BUT\nTHEY DID SAY THAT THEY SEARCHED THE BUILDINGS SURROUNDING WHERE\nTHAT DUMPSTER WAS. THEY DID NOT HAVE TO EVACUATE\nANYONE. SO WE DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS STORE\nFRONTS AND BUSINESSES THEY WERE LOOKING TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY\nSTRUCTURAL DAMAGE.

INVESTIGATORS ARE LOOKING AT\nSURVEILLANCE VIDEO. WE KNEW THEY HAD IT.\nBUT IT APPEARS TO SHOW A PERSON NEAR WHERE THE EXPLOSION AT THE\n23rd STREET LOCATION OCCURRED. THAT'S ACCORDING TO LOCAL AND\nFEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS.\nINVESTIGATORS ARE TRYING TO DETERMINE IF THAT INDIVIDUAL IS\nCONNECTED TO THIS EXPLOSION. SO THAT'S THE FIRST TIME IN\nHOURS COVERING THIS STORY THAT WE HAVE HEARD PERHAPS OF A\nPERSON OF SUSPICION INVOLVED WITH THIS.\n>> RIGHT. EARLY ON INVESTIGATORS DID SAY\nTHAT IT WAS INTENTIONAL. NOW WE ARE OBVIOUSLY CONNECTING\nDOTS AND LEARNING MAW. LET'S GO THE RICHARD QUEST WHO\nIS AT THE SCENE IN NEW YORK, THE SECOND SITE JUST FOUR BLOCKS\nAWAY. RICHARD, WHAT ARE YOU HEARING\nTHERE? >> Reporter: WHAT HAPPENED WAS\nSEVERAL HOURS AGO, JUST AN HOUR OR TWO AFTER THE FIRST EXPLOSION\nTHAT JEAN WAS TALKING ABOUT ON 23rd STREET WE BECAME AWARE THAT\nTHERE WAS A LARGE SCALE POLICE OPERATION JUST FOUR BLOCKS\nFURTHER NORTH AT 27th STREET, WHICH IS -- I'LL GO OUT THIS WAY\nACTUALLY. AND YOU CAN SEE.\nTHAT'S 27th STREET. TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA, 27th STREET\nIS IT IS A VERY NON-DESCRIPT BLOCK BETWEEN SIXTH AND SEVENTH.\nSOME APARTMENT BUILDINGS, SOME NEW BUILDINGS.\nSEVERAL SMALL BUSINESS, IT'S CERTAINLY BY NO MEANS A MAJOR\nTHOROUGHFARE LIKE 23rd OR A SERIOUSLY IMPORTANT STREET.\nBUT WHAT THEY DID FINE WAS THIS PRESSURE COOKER.\nYOU HAVE BEEN SHOWING THE PICTURES NOW.\nWE CAN SHOW IT AGAIN. THIS PRESSURE COOKER WITH WIRES\nCOMING OUT, A CELL PHONE. BUT THEY HAVE NOT SAID WHO AT W\nIN IT. WHAT WE SAW SHORTLY AFTER WAS A\nDEVICE OR BOMB CONTAINMENT UNIT ARRIVING, WHICH IS A BIG DRUM ON\nTHE BACK OF A TRUCK. THAT WENT DOWN 27th STREET.\nAND WE BELIEVE -- WE BELIEVE THE DEVICES THAT SINCE BEEN REMOVED.\n>> RICHARD, ONE OTHER THING, JUST TO SET THE CONTEXT AND SET\nTHE SCENE. IT IS A BUSY SATURDAY NIGHT.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE OUT. UNGA SET TO START SOON.\nMANY PEOPLE WILL BE OUT THERE. >> THE PRESIDENT'S ARRIVING\nTONIGHT AS WELL IN NEW YORK CITY.\n>> A LOT HAPPENING. HELP OUR VIEWERS UNDERSTAND THE\nCONTEXT THERE. >> I'M ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE.\nI WAS JUST DOWN IN THE VILLAGE MINDSING MY OWN VILLAGE MINDING\nMY OWN BUSINESS HAVING HAD DINNER WITH FRIENDS AND ALL OF A\nSUDDEN I HEARD A LOAD OF SIRENS, AND WENT PAST ME BLACK LIMOS --\nBLACK BIG CARS, FIRE BRIGADE AND AMBULANCES.\nMY IMMEDIATE THOUGHT BECAUSE IT'S THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL\nASSEMBLY. LIMOVILLE.\nTHE LIMOS STARTED AND THE ENTOURAGES AND MOTORCADES\nSTARTED TO COME. AND MORE AND MORE STARTED TO\nCOMING UP SIXTH AVENUE. IT RAPIDLY BECAME CLEAR 23rd\nSTREET, FOUR BLOCKS THAT WAY AND UP HERE AS WELL WAS SOMETHING\nMORE SERIOUS. WHAT WAS THE EVENING LIKE?\nIT WAS A PERFECT FALL EVENING. AS YOU CAN SEE, I'VE COME\nSTRAIGHT FROM THE SCENE FROM WHERE I WAS EARLIER, SHORT\nSLEEVES. IT WAS A WARM NIGHT.\nTHE STREETS WERE ABSOLUTELY PACKED WITH PEOPLE, WHICH DOES\nNOT SURPRISE ME, HAVING SEEN THE EVENING THAT THERE WERE MORE\nTHAN 20 INJURIES ON 23rd STREET. BECAUSE ALTHOUGH 23rd STREET --\nI MEAN IT IS A DOUBLE -- IT'S TWO-WAY TRAFFIC.\nIT IS EXTREMELY BUSY. LOTS OF RESTAURANTS, BARS,\nPIZZERIAS AND THOSE SORT OF THINGS.\nAND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PACKED AT THE TIME.\nPARTICULARLY AT THE CORNER WHERE 125 23rd STREET IS, WHICH IS\nWHERE THIS TOOK PLACE. TONIGHT, JUST TO WRAP ON THIS\nPOINT AS I'VE WALKED AROUND THE AREA BECAUSE POLICE WERE THEN\nLOOKING INTO EVERY CAR, IN EVERY GARBAGE CAN, ON EVERY CORNER TO\nSEE IF THERE WERE OTHER DEVICES, THE STREETS, GUYS, WERE\nABSOLUTELY PACKED WITH PEOPLE. >> AND TO THAT POINT, YOU KNOW,\nIT'S INTERESTING NO ONE WAS KILLED IN THIS.\nONE PERSON IS IN CRITICAL CONDITION.\nWE'RE TOLD THE OTHERS DO NOT HAVE LIFE THREATENING INJURIES.\nSO THAT'S AMAZING IN AND OF ITSELF.\nI WANT TO ASK YOU, RICHARD, ABOUT THIS DEVICE, THIS PRESSURE\nCOOKER, WHAT DO THEY PLAN TO DO WITH IT.\n>> ARE THEY WORKING ON IT THERE? ARE THEY REMOVING IT?\nDO YOU HAVE INFORMATION ON THAT? >> Reporter: THEY HAVE NOT\nCONFIRMED THAT IT'S BEEN REMOVED, BUT SOURCES HAVE TOLD\nCNN THAT IT HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY. AND THAT WOULD CERTAINLY FOLLOW\nON FROM WHAT WE'RE SEEING. ABOUT A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO\nTHERE WERE A LOT MORE FIRE BRIGADES.\nTHERE WERE HELICOPTERS OVERHEAD. WE SAW THE BOMB CONTAINMENT\nDEVICE GOING -- THE BOMB CONTAINMENT UNIT GOING IN THERE.\nQUITE A LOT OF THE POLICE HAVE GONE, QUITE A LOT OF THE FIRE\nBRIGADE HAVE GONE. THE TOWARD IS IT HAS BEEN TAKEN\nTO THE BRONX, WHICH IS A BOMB DISPOSAL UNIT WHERE IT CAN BE\nSAFELY DEFUSED AND THEN ANALYZED.\nBUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER, WE KNOW VIRTUALLY NOTHING ABOUT\nTHIS OTHER THAN WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN, THE PRESSURE COOKER, SOME\nWIRES COMING OUT OF IT, OH, YES AND ONE OTHER FACT.\nONE OTHER FACT, THE EMERGENCY WARNING THAT WAS SENT OUT ON THE\nCELL PHONE NETWORK TO ALL PEOPLE LIVING IN THE AREA TO STAY AWAY\nFROM THE WINDOWS. AND I CAN TELL YOU THERE IS A\nHOTEL DOWN ON 27th STREET. THERE IS A HOTEL HALFWAY DOWN\nTHE BLOCK JUST OPPOSITE WHERE THE DEVICE WAS WHERE ALL THE\nRESIDENTS OF THE HOTEL HAVE BEEN TOLD TO STAY IN AND AWAY FROM\nTHE WINDOWS. BUT THOSE GUESTS WHO WERE AWAY\nFROM THE HOTEL CAN'T GET BACK. SO THERE ARE SEVERAL PEOPLE\nWALKING AROUND THESE STREETS THAT ARE SORT OF BEFALLEN\nUNDER -- LET ME READ YOU THAT MESSAGE.\nIT WAS THE EMERGENCY ALERT THAT CAME OUT AN HOUR AGO.\nIT SAID SUSPICIOUS PACKAGE, RESIDENTS ON WEST 27th BETWEEN\nSIXTH AND SEVENTH, STAY AWAY FROM THE WINDOWS.\nALTHOUGH THE BUILDINGS WERE NOT EVACUATED, PEOPLE CAN'T GET BACK\nINTO HOTELS THAT ARE ALONG THERE AND RESIDENTS CAN'T GET HOME.\n>> IMPORTANT THE POINT OUT, RICHARD, TO OUR VIEWERS HERE IN\nTHE U.S. AND AROUND THE WORLD. INVESTIGATORS STILL LOOKING INTO\nTHIS. NO NEXUS IN TERRORISM AT THIS\nPOINT. OBVIOUSLY THE INVESTIGATION\nCONTINUES. BUT OUR REPORTERS CONTINUE TO\nCOVER THIS LIVE. JEAN CASAREZ AT THE SITE OF THE\nEXPLOSION. RICHARD QUEST WHERE THE SECOND\nDEVICE WAS DISCOVERED. GUYS WE'LL STAY IN TOUCH\nTHROUGHOUT THE NIGHT.",

THERE IS NO AUTHORIZATION FROM\nTHE U.S. MILITARY TO HIT THE SYRIAN FORCES, THE U.S. IS NOT\nAT WAR WITH THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT OR THE SYRIAN FORCES,\nBUT NONE THE LESS, A DREADFUL INCIDENT TODAY, A MISTAKE, IN\nTHE VIEW OF THE U.S. IN WHICH DOZENS OF SYRIAN FORCES WERE\nKILLED AND INJURED. >> AS OUR VIEWERS ARE WATCHING\nTHIS, YOU'RE SEEING PREVIOUSLY SHOT FOOTAGE IN THE EASTERN PART\nOF SYRIA. THIS IS NOT FOOTAGE OF THE\nACTUAL AIR STRIKE TODAY. BARBARA, A SPOKESWOMAN FOR\nRUSSIAN'S FOREIGN MINISTRY SAYS THIS IS THE WHITE HOUSE\nDEFENDING ISIS, WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?\n>> THIS MAY WELL BE THE MESSAGE POINT THAT MOSCOW WANTS TO PUT\nOUT. I THINK IT IS SAFE TO SAY THE\nADMINISTRATION, THE PENTAGON, THE U.S. MILITARY COULD NOT\nDISAGREE MORE STRONGLY. OUR TEAM IN SYRIA KNOWS MUCH\nMORE ABOUT ALL OF THIS. DEIR EZZOR IS VERY COMPLICATED.\nISIS IS CONSTANTLY PRESSING AT A SMALL HELD AREA THERE.\nTHE REGIME FORCES HAVE BEEN HANGING ON, IF YOU WILL, IN THIS\nAREA OF EASTERN SYRIA. SO, YOU KNOW, THE RUSSIANS COULD\nHAVE THE MESSAGE POINT, IF YOU WILL, THAT THE U.S. MUST BE\nTRYING TO SUPPORT ISIS AND PUSH THE LAST OF THE SYRIAN FORCES\nOUT OF THERE AND LAUNCH THAT STRIKE TODAY.\nTHE REACTION OF THE U.S. MILITARY IS NOT THAT AND THAT\nTHE SUCCESS TARGETING ISIS AND AL-QAEDA IN SYRIA.\nTHE U.S. IS NOT AT WAR WITH SYRIA, AND THIS APPEARS TO BE A\nTERRIBLE MISTAKE. PERHAPS THE REALLY KEY QUESTION\nTONIGHT IS HOW, ON EARTH, DID THIS HAPPEN?\nDID THE U.S. PILOTS HIT THE TARGETS THEY WERE AIMING AT AND\nIT WAS BAD INTELLIGENCE? IT WAS SYRIAN FORCES, NOT ISIS\nTHERE. DID THEY HIT THE TARGET THEY\nWERE AIMING AT AND IT PROVED TO BE BAD INTEL, OR DID THE BOMBS\nNOT HIT THE CORRECT TARGET AND THEY HIT SYRIAN FORCES.\n>> THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IN THE LAST FEW MOMENTS SAY THEY\nREGRET THAT SYRIAN FORCES WERE STRUCK.\nLET'S BRING IN MICHAEL WEISS. HE IS A AUTHOR FOR \"THE DAILY\nBEAST.\" IT COULD BE A FEW DIFFERENT\nSN SCENARIOS, BUT WE'RE TALKING\nABOUT 120 DEATHS, 180 TROOPS INJURED.\nWALK ME THROUGH THE SITUATION AND THE NUMBER OF PLAYERS ON THE\nGROUND. >> IT IS PARTICULARLY\nCOMPLICATED. THIS IS WHERE A U.S. TRAINED\nREBEL FORCE TRIED TO CONDUCT A DARING AND FULL HEARTY RAID.\nTHEY WERE ROUTED AND THERE WAS NO AIR SUPPORT.\nTHERE IS AN DWINDLING THERE. THIS IS A LYNCH PIN REASON ALONG\nWITH RAQQA BY WHICH THEY CONNECT.\n>> SO IT MAKES SINCE THEY WOULD BE STRIKING ISIS THERE.\n>> ABSOLUTELY, IN FACT WHAT IS IRONIC AND WHAT PROBABLY\nHAPPENED, AND IT IS TOO SOON TO SAY FOR SURE, IF ISIS WAS\nPRESENT, CLOSE TO THE SYRIAN REGIME FORCES, BECAUSE THEY TOOK\nSOME OF THE TERRAIN, IT MEANT THAT THE U.S. WAS EFFECTIVELY\nPROVIDING SUPPORT TO THE ASSAD REGIME.\n>> ONE THING THAT I WAS TOLD EARLIER THIS EVENING IS THAT THE\nARIEL MARKING OF THE TROOPS IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM ISIS FORCES.\n>> THEY'RE SAYING THEY WERE SYRIAN ARAB ARMY SOLDIERS.\nIT COULD BE THEY WERE DISBURSED WITH A CONSORTIUM OF TROOPS THAT\nWERE TRAINED TO DO THE HEAVY LIFTING.\n>> LET TALK ABOUT WHY -- THE SPOKESWOMAN CAME OUT AND AID\n\"WE'RE REACHING A TERRIFYING CONCLUSION FOR THE WHOLE WORLD,\nTHAT THE WHITE HOUSE IS DEFENDING THE ISLAMIC STATE.\"\nTHEY HAVE CALLED AN EMERGENCY MEETING THAT WILL BEGIN IN HALF\nAN HOUR, WHY IS RUSSIA SAYING THIS.\n>> NEVER LET A GOOD CRISIS GO TO WASTE WHEN YOU'RE THE RUSSIAN OR\nTHE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT. HOWEVER, IF THE U.S. WILL ONLY\nCOORDINATE WITH US MORE CLOSELY AND TALK TO US AND WE CAN BOMB\nISIS TOGETHER, WE CAN CONTINUE THE WAR IN SYRIA.\nTHE GOAL FROM THE BEGINNING, THE REASON FOR RUSSIA'S INTERVENTION\nA YEAR AGO WAS TO DRAW THE UNITED STATES INTO THE ORBIT.\nMAKE IT NOT ABOUT REGIME CHANGE, THE FREE SYRIAN ARMY, OR\nFACILITATING A POLITICAL TRANSITION, BUT IS STRICTLY\nCOUNTERTERRORISM POLICY. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN HAPPEN IS THE\nOBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS CREPT CLOSER TO THAT.\nONE OF THE STATEMENTS RELEASED TONIGHT WAS ONE OF THE MOST\nCONTRITE. THEY DON'T SAY THAT WHEN THEY\nACCIDENTALLY BOMB SYRIAN CIVILIANS.\nAWE SENIOR OBAMA ADMINISTRATION SAY WE'RE CONSIDERING PAYING CAN\nCOMPENSATION TO THE FAMILIES -- >> BUT THE UNITED STATES NEEDS\nTHE ASSAD REGIME, AND NEEDS RUSSIA TO DEFEAT ISIS.\n>> THE RUSSIANS AND THE SYRIAN REGIME HAVE NOT FOUGHT ISIS AS\nMUCH AS THEY HAVE LET ON. MAJORITY OF THE FIGHTING HAS\nBEEN AGAINST THE SYRIAN OPPOSITION.\n>> AND THE U.S. SAID YOU'RE BACKING UP THE ASSAD REGIME,\nYOU'RE SUPPORTING IT RATHER THAN DOING EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO\nFIGHT IT. >> SO NOW WHAT, THAT'S THE\nQUESTION, RIGHT? >> I EXPECT THERE WILL BE A\nPANTOMIME AT THE U.N. A PANEL JUST CONCLUDED YESTERDAY\nAND THEY DECIDED THAT THEY WERE USING CHLORINE GAS BOMBS.\nWHAT WILL HAPPEN IS THERE WILL BE A DANCE AT THE U.N. SECURITY\nCOUNTY COUNCIL, AND IT IS PERFECTLY\nTIMES, AND I THINK WASHINGTON WILL COME OUT AND SAY WE'RE SO\nSORRY, WE DON'T WANT THIS TO DISTURB THE CEASE FIRE AND THE\nJOINT INTELLIGENCE COMMAND THAT WILL BE SET UP IN JORDAN TO\nCOORDINATE OUR AIR CAMPAIGN. >> BUT THE CEASEFIRE IS ALREADY\nDEL DELICATE, SIX DAYS LONG, BUT THE\nPEOPLE THERE THAT NEED THE AIDE ARE STILL NOT GETTING IT AND\nTHIS MAKES IT IT EVEN WORSE. >> THANK YOU, I WANT TO GET TO\nTHE UNITED NATIONS NOW. WE HAVE RICHARD ROTH WITH US.\nTHIS EMERGENCY MEETING STARTS IN ABOUT 20 MINUTES, MICHAEL WEISS\nCALLING IT A DANCE, IF YOU WILL. >> I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT WILL\nBE AS EXCITING AS THAT, BUT IT WILL TAKE PLACE BEHIND DOORS.\nWE KNOW THAT U.S. AMBASSADOR SAMANTHA POWER WILL SPEAK TO THE\nPRESS BEFORE THE SESSION. AS THEY MENTIONED, THE U.S. WILL\nWANT TO, AND RUSSIA, TOO, KEEP THIS AGREEMENT IF THEY CAN.\nIN FACT, RUSSIA WILL WANT TO SCORE POLITICAL POINTS FOR NOW\nAND FOR GOING AHEAD.

PRESIDENT PUTIN IS NOT HERE.\nTHE BIG PARTY FOR THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY WAS LAST YEAR, BUT\nSYRIA WAS GOING TO BE ONE OF THE MAIN TOPICS HERE.\nWEDNESDAY THERE WAS GOING TO BE A MEETING.\nI THINK THEY OUGHT THOUGHT THEY COULD WRAP UP SYRIA AND SHOW\nMOMENTUM GOING FORWARD. YOU ALSO HAVE A BIG REFUGEE\nSUMMIT THROUGH MONDAY AND TUESDAY.\nTHAT WAS TO PROVIDE MORE FUNDING, COMMITMENT, AND MORE\nTHERE. SHOULD IT GET OUT OF HAND, THAT\nIMPERILS A FEW OTHER THINGS.

WE ARE INVESTIGATING THE\nINCIDENT.

SINCE 2011, THE ASACK REGIME HAS\nBEEN INTENTIONALLY STRIKING SYRIAN TARGETS WITH HORRIFYING\nREGULAR PREDICTABLE REGULARITY. THEY HAVE BESIEGED CIVILIAN\nEFFORTS, STOPPED HUMANITARIAN AIDE FROM REACHING PEOPLE\nSTARVING TO DEATH, AND BASIC MEDICINE THAT IS RIPPED OUT OF\nTRUCKS. THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT HAS\nPATENTED THE PRACTICE OF DOUBLE TAP STRIKES.\nHITTING A CIVILIAN TARGET, WAITING FOR HEROIC INDIVIDUALS\nTO RUN INTO BURNING BUILDINGS TO HELP VICTIMS, AND THEN STRIKING\nAGAIN TO HIT THE RESCUE PERSONNEL.\nTHEY USE CHEMICAL WEAPONS AGAINST THEIR OWN PEOPLE.\nIT HAS TORTURED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN THEIR\nPRISONS THAT NOW DOUBLE AT TORTURE CHAMBERS.\nIN THOSE PRISONS, THEY DOCUMENT SYSTEMATICALLY WHAT IT'S DOING\nTO THE PEOPLE IN IT'S DISCUSS DID.\nSERIAL NUMBERS, DOCUMENTS, AND GROWTH DOCUMENTING THE TORTURE\nOF PEOPLE WITH SUCH SAVAGERY. METICULOUS DETAIL.\nYET IN THE FACE OF NONE OF THESE ATROCITIES HAVE THEY EXPRESSED\nOUTRAGE OR DEMANDED INVESTIGATIONS, OR CALLED FOR A\nSATURDAY NIGHT EMERGENCY CONSULTATION IN THE SECURITY\nCOUNSEL, OR A MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY,\nSATURDAY, SUNDAY. NO DAY OF THE WEEK HAVE THEY\nCALLED AN EARLY MORNING CONSULTATION ON ANY OF THE\nPRACTICES. THESE ARE SOME OF THE MOST\nSYSTEMATIC ATROCITIES WE HAVE SEEN IN A JEN GENERATION, BUT\nTHEY HAVE USED THEIR VOOE TOE TO BLOCK MEANINGFUL ACTION.\nIT IS THE MOST OBVIOUS THREAT TO SECURITY THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN A\nLONG TIME AND A YEAR AGO, RUSSIA DECIDED TO JOIN THE REGIME,\nESCALATE THE CONFLICT, AND IT IS SELF ADOPTING SOME OF THE WORST\nPRACTICES. HITTING HOSPITALS, REFUGEE\nCAMPS, MARKETS, WITHOUT A SINGLE PUBLIC EXPRESSION OF REMORSE.\nSERIOUSLY? THEY'RE KILLING THIS EMERGENCY\nMEETING? REALLY?\nNOW BECAUSE OF A SINGLE AIR STRIKE, IF IT STRUCK REGIME\nFORCES, IN ERROR, A STRIKE THAT WE HAVE SWIFTLY ACKNOWLEDGED AND\nCOMMITTED TO INVESTIGATING, NONE OF WHICH THE ASSAD REGIME, OR\nRUSSIA HAVE EVER DONE FOR THEIR ATTACKS ON INNOCENT CIVILIANS.\nIMAGINE HOW OFTEN THIS COUNTY TILL WOULD BE MEETING IF WE WERE\nTOGETHER EVERY TIME THE REGIME OR RUSSIA STRUCK A HOSPITAL OR A\nSCHOOL OR A BREAD LINE. EVERY TIME THEY BLOCKED VITAL\nAIDE FROM REACHING CHILDREN WHO ARE EATING LEAVES SO THEY DO NOT\nSTARVE TO DEATH. OR WHO BLOCK MEDICINE FROM\nREACHING PEOPLE DIEING EVERY SINGLE DAY BECAUSE THEY ARE\nFORCED TO DRINK FOUL WATER AND HAVE NO ANTIBIOTICS.\nTHERE ARE SO MUCH TO BE JUSTIFIED, IS CIVILIAN SUFFERING\nTHAT COULD BE PREVENTED, LIVES THAT COULD BE SAVED, IF ONLY THE\nREAL PERPETRATORS WERE MADE TO STOP.\nSO IF ON THIS SATURDAY NIGHT, AND THIS DAY HENCE FORCE, IF WE\nCOULD FOCUS OUR OUTRAGE ON THAT, THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE.\nWE ARE ALSO TRYING TO FOCUS ON THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE, AND\nTHE NEED FOR PEACE IN SYRIA. AND WE BELIEVE THAT RUSSIA\nSHOULD BE CONVENING AN EMERGENCY MEETING THIS EVENING.\nAN EMERGENCY MEETING WITH THE A SASSAD REGIME.\nTHAT IS CONTINUING THE PRACTICE OF TEST BY 2,000 PAPER CUTS.\nIN STARVING THE CIVILIANS. THEY HAVE TO STOP BOMBING THOSE\nTHAT SIGNED UP FOR THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES, AND THEY HAVE TO\nDELIVER AS THEY ASSURED US THEY WOULD.\nRUSSIA IS NOT DELIVERING ON IT'S END OF THE DEAL THAT WE SPENT\nMONTHS NEGOTIATING IN EXTREMELY TECHNICAL DETAIL.\n. THE USE -- UNITED STATES IS VERY\nSERIOUS ABOUT MAKING IT WORK. WE HAVE SPOKEN WITH RUSSIAN\nFOREIGN MINISTER, INCLUDING TODAY, AND SECRETARY KERRY TOLD\nTHE FOREIGN MINISTER THAT THE REGIME IS BOMBING GROUPS WHO ARE\nPARTY TO THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES.\nEVEN THOUGH VIOLENCE IS DOWN, IN MANY PARTS OF SYRIA THE REGIME\nIS ACTING AGAINST GROUPS THAT WANT TO BE PART OF THIS PEACE\nPROCESS. AND SECRETARY KERRY SAID THE\nAIDE IS FLOWING. U.N. TRUCKS HAVE BEEN IDLING,\nFILLED WITH PRECIOUS FOOD, AS MOTHERS CAN'T FEED THEIR KIDS.\nSECRETARY KERRY SHARED ALL OF THIS, BUT HE DENT -- DIDN'T HAVE\nTO, THEY KNOW WHAT GROUPS ARE TERRORISTS AND WHAT GROUPS ARE\nOPPOSITION GROUPS THAT WANT TO BE PART OF A POLITICAL\nTRANSITION AND WHO WANT A MULTICONFESSIONAL PLURALISTIC\nSOCIETY ON THE BACK END. THEY KNOW THE DIFFERENCE INTO\nWHY ARE WE HAVING THIS MEETING TONIGHT?\nIT'S A DIVERSION FROM WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THE GROUND IN\nSYRIA. WHEN YOU DON'T LIKE THE FACTS,\nTRY TO CREATE ATTENTION SOMEWHERE ELSE\" GET THE WORLD\nAND THE MEDIA TO FOCUS OVER HERE SO THEY DON'T LOOK AT WHAT IS\nHAPPENING OVER THERE. WHAT IS HAPPENING OVER THERE IS\nSO IMPORTANT. IT IS JEOPARDIZING SOMETHING\nTHAT GIVES THE SYRIAN PEOPLE A CHANCE.\nWE ENCOURAGE THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION TO CALL EMERGENCY\nMEE MEETINGS.\nI WANT TO MAKE ONE LAST POINT, RUSSIA HAS BILLED ITSELF AS THE\nWORLD'S DEFENDER AGAINST TERRORISM.\nPART OF WHAT IT IS ALLEGING TONIGHT IS THAT SOMEHOW THE\nUNITED STATES IS UNDERMINING THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIL.\nTHE RUSSIAN SPOKESPERSON THOUGHT WE WERE COMPLICIT AND PROTECTING\nTHEM. ISIL HAS LOST 40% OF THEIR\nTERRITORY, THIS IS SERIOUS FOR US.\nIT IS NOT A GAME, AND THAT SPOKES PERSON THAT SUGGESTED\nCOMPLICITY SHOULD BE EMBARRASSED.\nWE'RE TRYING TO BE SERIOUS. ABOUT ENSURING SYRIANS CAN GET\nUP IN THE MORNING AND GO TO SLEEP AT THE END OF THE DAY.\nSO THERE CAN BE A POLITICAL TRANSITION SO THE WAR ENDS, AND\nEVERYTHING THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT.\nAND THEY ALLOWED ISIL TO GROW, GROW, AND GROW.\nBUSY HITTING MARKETS, REFUGEE MARKETS, DISPLACED CAMPS, USING\nCHEMICAL WEAPONS THAT ISIL TOOK ROOT AND PROSPERED RIGHT BESIDE\nTHE REGIME. THE BEST WAY TO FIGHT THEM, AS\nRUSSIA SAYS THEY WANT, IS TO STOP BOMBING CIVILIANS AND\nGROUPS. AND DELIVER THE ASSAD REGIME TO\nIMPLEMENT WHAT HAS BEEN AGREED. THEIR TACTICS AND STRATEGY HAVE\nBEEN A GIFT TO TERRORISTS IN SYRIA AND WELL BEYOND.\nAND THESE ARE TERRORISTS WHO THREATEN US ALL.\nON THAT WE AGREE. THERE IS A BETTER WAY FORWARD,\nBUT RUSSIA REALLY NEEDS TO STOP THE CHEAP POINT SCORING AND THE\nGRANDSTANDING, AND THE STUNTS, AND FOCUS ON WHAT MATTERS, WHICH\nIS IMPLEMENTATION OF SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE SHOWN IT CAN REDUCE\nVIOLENCE AND SAVE LIVES, AND IT",

THE U.S. IS STILL INVESTIGATING.\nTHE DEATH TOLL OF THAT STRIKE MORE THAN 80.\nSO RUSSIA THEN PROCEEDED TO SAY THEN IT WAS THE UNITED STATES\nAND THE WHITE HOUSE SUPPORTING ISIS BY MAKING THIS STRIKE\nAGAINST SYRIAN FORCES. THEY CALLED AN EMERGENCY MEETING\nAT THE UNITED NATIONS THAT IS JUST BEGINNING NOW, AND THE U.S.\nAMBASSADOR SAMANTHA POWER JUST GAVE A LONG STATEMENT RESPONDING\nTO RUSSIA'S ALLEGATIONS AS SHE HEADED INTO THAT MEETING.\nRICHARD ROTH, THE SIGNIFICANCE, IF IT WAS INDEED THE U.S. THAT\nSTRUCK ASSAD'S SYRIAN FORCES THEN THAT WAS NOT THEIR\nINTENTIONS.

LOOK IF RUSSIA AND THE U.S. WANT\nTO GO FORWARD WITH THE AGREEMENT WHATEVER IS SAID HERE, THE\nAGREEMENT TO TRY TO GET A PAUSE IN THE TRUCE AND GET AID IN, YOU\nNEVER KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN YOU HAVE TARGETING AND MAYBE NOT\nTARGETING BUT ACCIDENTAL HITTING SYRIAN SOLDIERS SUPPORTED BY\nRUSSIA. I'M SURE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR WAS\nSQUIRMING IN HIS ROOM WITH SAMANTHA POWER OUTSIDE.\nTHE MEETING PROBABLY STARTED WITHOUT HER.\nBUT HE HAS ALREADY TOLD ME ON HIS WAY IN A HALF HOUR AGO THAT\nHE WILL SPEAK AT THE SAME MEETING IN THE SECURITY COUNCIL.\nSO YES, SAMANTHA POWER SAID RUSSIA HAS PULLED A STUNT BY\nHAVING AN EMERGENCY MEETING, REPLETE WITH GRANDSTANDING AND\nUNIQUELY CRITICAL. SAMANTHA POWER SAYING WHERE HAS\nRUSSIAN BEEN WHEN IT HAS BEEN CONCERNED WITH HUNDREDS OF\nTHOUSANDS OF DEATHS WITH THE ASSAD REGIME BACKED BY MOSCOW\nSH. >> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 400,000\nSYRIANS WHO HAVE BEEN KILLED SINCE THE 2011 CONFLICT.\n>> Reporter: YES, HE IS COMING TO THE MICROPHONE TO SPEAK TO\nTHE MEDIA NOW. >> WE'LL GET TO THAT IN A\nMOMENT. I DO WANT TO GO TO OUR MATTHEW\nCHANCE. ALL RIGHT.\nAS WE WAIT FOR HIM TO MAKE HIS REMARKS, LET'S GO TO MATTHEW\nCHANCE IN MOSCOW, YOU HEARD, MATTHEW, SAMANTHA POWER SAYING\nTHAT THE SPOKESPERSON FOR RUSSIA WHO SUGGESTED THAT THE\nCOMPLICITY OF THE UNITED STATES, SHOULD HAVE BEEN EMBARRASSED.\nHAVE WE SEEN RELATIONS THIS TENSE BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES\nAND RUSSIA THIS COLD SINCE THE COLD WAR?\n>> I THINK IT'S VERY INTERESTING TO HEAR THE TONE OF THE RHETORIC\nCOMING FROM THE SECURITY COUNCIL TONIGHT.\nREMEMBER IN SYRIA THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE AN ERA WHERE A\nMOMENT THAT -- WHERE BUILDING TRUST, THEY'RE TRYING TO GET\nTHIS TRUCE OFF THE GROUND, TO STOP THE BLOODSHED, AND THESE\nKIND OF REMARKS COMING OUT OF RUSSIA, AS WELL, ACCUSING THE\nWHITE HOUSE OF DEFENDING ISIS, WHICH IS THE LINE THAT CAME OUT\nOF THE FOREIGN MINISTRY EARLIER --\n>> MATTHEW, LET'S LISTEN TO THE AMBASSADOR OF RUSSIA.\n>> AMERICAN UNDERHANDEDNESS AS WE WITNESSED TODAY.\nAS I TALKED IN THE SECURITY COUNCIL, SHARING OUR ANALYSIS\nOVER THE FRUSTRATION OF SYRIA, THE AMBASSADOR CHOSE TO TALK TO\nYOU. THE ONLY THING OUR DEPUTY HAS TO\nSAY IN RESPONSE TO THE COMMENTS WAS THE U.S. IS INVESTIGATING.\nAS THE AMBASSADOR WALKED IN, FIRST THING SHE SAID, SHE WAS\nNOT INTERESTED IN WHAT I HAD TO SAY BECAUSE WHAT I WAS SAYING\nWAS IT WAS A STUNT. SO THERE IS NO POINT IN\nLISTENING TO AMBASSADOR POWERS. SO I DECIDED TO LEAVE THE ROOM,\nMY DELEGATION IS THERE AND TO SHARE MY REFLECTIONS WITH YOU.\nIN FACT THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS CONCERN THAT WE WANTED AND DID\nSHARE TODAY WITH THE MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL.\nAS YOU KNOW, WE CONVENED THE COUNCIL BECAUSE THE U.S. BOMBED\nTHE FORCES IN ARE. THE SYRIAN ARMED FORCES SUFFERED\n60 CASUALTIES, OVER 100 SOLDIERS INJURED AND THERE IS A THREAT OF\nISOL ADVANCING ONLY THEIR FORCES.\nTHE RUSSIAN FORCESAS WERE ABLE COME TO THE ASSISTANCE SO WE\nHOPE THIS TRAGEDY IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.\nHAVING CONDUCTED THE AIRSTRIKE, THE UNITED STATES HAS VIOLATED\nTWO OF ITS COMMITMENTS. ONE IS THE COMMITMENT TO THE\nHOSTILITIES WHICH THE UNITED STATES UNDERTOOK TOGETHER IN\nFEBRUARY, AND WHICH WE RECONFIRMED TWO DAYS AGO, THE\nOTHER IS THE COMMITMENT THE UNITED STATES GAVE TO THE\nGOVERNMENT OF SYRIA WHEN THE UNITED STATES STARTED ITS AIR\nCAMPAIGN TWO YEARS AGO. THE UNITED STATES PROMISED TO\nTHE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT THAT THE AIRSTRIKES ARE NOT GOING TO\nAFFECT THE POSITION OF THE SYRIAN ARMED FORCES.\nTHAT DID NOT PUT THE UNITED STATES FULLY IN LINE WITH\nINTERNATIONAL LAW BECAUSE THEY DID NOT RECEIVE THE CONSENT OF\nTHE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT, BUT THE FACT THAT THE UNITED STATES WAS\nCOMMITTED NOT TO STRIKE THE POSITIONS OF THE SYRIAN\nGOVERNMENT CREATED CERTAIN CONDITIONS FOR CONTINUED\nCOOPERATION OF THE UNITED STATES POLITICALLY AND A NUMBER OF\nPRACTICAL ASPECTS OF THE SITUATION IN SYRIA.\nIT IS QUITE SUSPICIOUS THAT THE UNITED STATES CHOSE TO CONDUCT\nTHIS PARTICULAR AIRSTRIKE AT THIS TIME.\nWHY ALL OF A SUDDEN THE UNITED STATES CHOOSES TO HELP THE\nSYRIAN ARMED FORCES. AFTER ALL, THEY DID NOTHING WHEN\nISOL WAS ADVANCING ON PALMYRA, ALL OF A SUDDEN THE UNITED\nSTATES DECIDES TO COME TO THE ASSISTANCE OF THE SYRIAN ARMED\nFORCES DEFENDING THEM, IT IS QUITE SIGNIFICANT AND I WOULD\nSUGGEST THAT THIS HAPPENED JUST TWO DAYS, BEFORE THE\nARRANGEMENTS, RUSSIAN ARRANGEMENTS TO COME INTO FORCE.\nTHE UNITED STATES WAS NEGOTIATING FOR A LONG TIME.\nAS YOU KNOW, THE FOREIGN MINISTER AND SECRETARY KERRY\nCONCLUDED IN AGREEMENT ON SEPTEMBER 9th, WHICH ACTUALLY\nPUT IN FORCE A NUMBER OF AGREEMENTS THEY NEGOTIATED FOR\nTHE PAST TWO MONTHS, FOR REASONS WE CANNOT UNDERSTAND, THE UNITED\nSTATES DID NOT AGREE TO SHARE WITH YOU --\n>> THERE YOU HAVE IT, THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED\nNATIONS CALLING IT QUOTE, SUSPICIOUS THAT THE U.S. CARRIED\nOUT THIS STRIKE IN SYRIA, KILLING SYRIAN REGIME FORCES AT\nTHIS TIME. CALLING THE TIMING OF IT NOT\nACCIDENTAL. RESPONDING TO U.S. AMBASSADOR --\nTO THE U.N., SAMANTHA POWER, CALLING RUSSIA'S RESPONSE A\nSTUNT, AND GRANDSTANDING, MUCH, MUCH MORE OF THIS AHEAD ON\nCNN.COM.

BOTH OF THESE CANDIDATES ARE\nSPEAKING TO THEIR CORE CONSTITUENCIES.\nDONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO BE COMING OUT IN A FEW MOMENTS TO\nTALK TO THIS ORGANIZATION OF FAMILIES OF VICTIMS THAT WERE\nKILLED BY UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS.\nON THE STAGE IS CHRIS KOBACH, KNOWN AS A THEORIST,\nANTI-IMMIGRATION ILLEGAL ACTIVIST.\nYOU WILL HEAR DONALD TRUMP TALKING ABOUT BUILDING THAT WALL\nAND HIS PLANS FOR DEALING WITH UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS.\nTA AT THE SAME TIME, HE IS STILL\nDEALING WITH A COUPLE OF CONTROVERSIES.\nTHE DEMOCRATS FEEL HE DID NOT PUT IT TO REST.\nTHEY BELIEVE HE OWES AN APOLOGY TO PRESIDENT OBAMA.\nTRUMP CREATED A BRAND NEW CONTROVERSY WHEN HE SUGGESTED\nTHAT HILLARY CLINTON PROTECTIVE DETAIL HAVE THEIR WEAPONS TAKEN\nAWAY, LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. SORT OF A CRACK ON CLINTON'S\nPOSITION ON GUNS. >> SHE IS VERY MUCH AGAINST THE\nSECOND AMENDMENT. SHE WANTS TO DESTROY YOUR SECOND\nAMENDMENT. GUNS, GUNS, GUNS.\nI THINK WHAT WE SHOULD DO. SHE GOES AROUND WITH ARMED\nBODYGUARDS LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.\nI THINK HER BODYGUARDS SHOULD DROP ALL WEAPONS.\nTHEY SHOULD DISARM, RIGHT? I THINK THEY SHOULD DISARM\nIMMEDIATELY. SHE DOESN'T WANT GUNS.\nTAKE THEIR GUNS AWAY. IT WOULD BE VERY DANGEROUS THIS\nIS NOT THE FIRST TIME HE HAS MADE THESE COMMENTS.\nLET ME KNOW IF YOU ARE LOOK AT THESE PICTURES ON SCREEN OF\nWHOSE UP ON STAGE THERE. THOSE ARE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO SAY\nTHEIR RELATIVES WERE KILLED BY UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS.\nYOU CAN SEE THEY ARE WEARING T-SHIRTS THAT SHOW THE PICTURES\nOF THOSE FAMILY MEMBERS.

YOU HEARD IN AN INTERVIEW WITH\nMIKE PENCE AND DONALD TRUMP EARLIER TODAY WAS CRITICIZED FOR\nNOT USING THE WORD DEPLORABLE AGAINST DAVID DUKE AND THE\nCAMPAIGN HAS REPEATEDLY DENOUNCED DAVID DUKE AND DAVID\nDUKE IS A RACIST, HE'S NOT  >> HE COULD BE BOTH.\n>> HE COULD BE BOTH. >> LET ME GET JOE IN, BECAUSE\nSOME IN THE MEDIA REACTED AND I WANT TO PLAY A LITTLE SOUND\nHERE, BY KIND OF DEFENDING THE POINT HILLARY CLINTON WAS MAKING\nABOUT TRUMP SUPPORTERS. LET'S ROLL THAT.\n>> DID SHE ACTUALLY NEED TO APOLOGIZE FOR THAT?\nWHEN YOU THINK ABOUT MANY OF THE ARCHITECTS BEHIND THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN WHO COME FROM THE ALT-RIGHT UNIVERSE, ONE COULD\nSAY HER DEPLORABLE. >> AS A MATTER OF STATISTICS,\nIT'S PROBABLY TRUE PEOPLE EXPRESSING RACIST SENTIMENT\nCONSTITUTE MORE THAN HALF OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS.\n>> SO WE'RE HEARING A LOT OF, YEAH, HILLARY CLINTON WAS RIGHT,\nBY PEOPLE IN THE PRESS WHO THINK HALF OR MORE OF DONALD TRUMP\nSUPPORTERS ARE TERRIBLE PEOPLE. >> I DON'T THINK -- WHO KNOWS\nHOW MANY ARE. THAT'S WHAT GOT HER IN THE WHOLE\nTROUBLE IN THE FIRST PLACE. >> YOU'VE BEEN IN CAMPAIGNS, IS\nIT SMART TO ATTACK THE OPPONENT'S VOTERS WHEN THOSE\nVOTERS MAY BE TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS?\n>> IT'S NOT, BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SLAMMED THE DOOR ON\nTHAT WAS TRUMP'S BIRTHER COMMENTS.\nHE HAD HER SORT OF TRYING TO EXPLAIN AWAY THE DEPLORABLE\nTHING, WHICH PUT THE QUESTION OF RACE AND BIGOTRY AND STUFF OUT\nTHERE, AND THEN HE COMES IN AND BY TRYING TO SLAM THE DOOR ON\nBIRTHERS, SORT OF REIGNITED A BIT.\n>> THAT WAS INTERESTING. >> THE COVERAGE, I THINK, HE\nTURNED THE COVERAGE WAS GOING AGAINST HER AND TURNED IT ON\nHIMSELF. >> HERE'S THE THING, WHEN I\nINTERVIEWED DONALD TRUMP, HE'S ON THE THREE-WEEK STRETCH OF\nBEING MORE SCRIPTED AND RESTRAINED, THEN WE HAD THE\nBIRTHER EVENT AND ALSO DONALD TRUMP SAYING THIS ABOUT HILLARY\nCLINTON AND HER BODY GUARDS. >> I THINK THAT HER BODY GUARDS\nSHOULD DROP ALL WEAPONS. THEY SHOULD DISARM.\nI THINK THEY SHOULD DISARM. IMMEDIATELY.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK, YES? YES.\nYEAH. TAKE THEIR GUNS AWAY.\nSHE DOESN'T WANT GUNS. TAKE THEM.\nLET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO HER. >> SO, GUN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS ALSO\nMAKE THE POINT THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE OPPOSED TO GUN RIGHTS, THEY\nHAVE SECURITY, IT'S KIND OF A TALKING POINT.\nTHE PRESS IS PLAYING THIS AS AN OUTRAGEOUS STATEMENT.\nCERTAINLY UNUSUAL FOR A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE TO SAY\nABOUT HIS OPPONENT. >> IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE PRESS\nTO COVER IT BECAUSE EVERYTHING A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SAYS IS\nIMPORTANT AND SPEAKS TO THEIR TEMPERAMENT.\n\"THE WASHINGTON POST,\" ERIN BLAKE THE REPORTER, ACTUALLY\nUNPACKED THE COMMENT HE MADE AND SAID HE'S MADE THE COMMENT MANY\nTIMES BEFORE AND IS JUST GIVING HIS SENTIMENT ON THE SECOND\nAMENDMENT. >> \"NEW YORK TIMES\" SAYS TRUMP\nRAISED THE SPECTRUM OF VIOLENCE AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON.\n>> I THINK THIS ONE IS REALLY DANGEROUS TERRITORY FOR HIM AND\nTHE PRESS TO GO DOWN, NOT BECAUSE OF WHAT HE SAID, BUT\nBECAUSE OF SOMEBODY OUT THERE WHO MIGHT HEAR IT AND ACT ON IT\nAND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES AND THE PRESS, I THINK, HAVING BEEN\nIN ALL THESE CAMPAIGNS WHERE THESE THREATS ARE REAL, YOU HAVE\nTO BE CAREFUL ABOUT IT. >> I JUST THINK THAT WE SHOULD\nBE DEBATING THE GUN POLICY. SECOND AMENDMENT POLICY BETWEEN\nHILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP.\nTHERE'S A DISTINCT DIFFERENCE. LET'S FOCUS ON THE POLICY.\nTHIS IS A GOOD WAY TO BRING THAT ISSUE FORWARD AND WE'RE NOT\nTALKING ABOUT IT. >> CAN I SAY ONE THING ABOUT THE\nDEPLORABLES COMMENT, THE DIFFERENCE WITH MITT ROMNEY IS\nMITT ROMNEY TRIED TO EXPLAIN HIS COMMENT ON 47% AWAY FOR WEEKS\nAND DIDN'T APOLOGIZE RIGHT AWAY, WHEREAS HILLARY CLINTON, THE\nREASON I THINK THE COVERAGE WENT AWAY --\n>> SHE APOLOGIZED FOR SAYING HALF.\n>> I'VE GOT TO MOVE ON. INTERESTINGLY, TRUMP IS LIKING\nCOMMENTS MORE ENDOWED, NOW CALLING HER CRAZY, WHACKY, AND\nNEUROTIC DOPE. SHE'S, I THINK, OFF THE\nCHRISTMAS CARD LIST.",

IN 2011 PLEADING GUILTY TO\nVARIOUS TERROR CHARGES. IN A STUNNING TURN OF EVENTS\nIS HE WORKING AT THE GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY CENTER\nFOR CYBER AND HOMELAND SECURITY.\nHE JOINS US NOW FROM WASHINGTON.\nFIRST OF ALL, WHY DID YOU JOIN AL QAEDA?\n>> WELL, THE PROCESS OF MY RADICALIZATION AND MY\nENTRANCE INTO ADHERENCE FOR AFINT TO AL QAEDA'S IDEOLOGY\nSTARTED AT VERY YOUNG AGE. I HAD A TRAUMATIC UPBRINGING\nIT MADE ME OPEN UP TO ALTERNATIVE IDEOLOGIES.\nTHEREAFTER I IDENTIFIED WITH ISLAM AFTER READING THE\nAUTOBIOGRAPHY WITH MALCOLM X AND COULD RELATE WITH A LOT\nOF HIS STORY. I WAS OPEN TO RADICAL\nINTERPRETATIONS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.\nCRIMINAL BEHAVIOR WAS UNDER PINNING DEVELOPMENT OF MY\nYOUTH. DURING THAT TIME I WENT TO\nJAIL AND WAS RADICALIZED BY A PREACHER IN JAIL SHORTLY\nBEFORE 9/11. SO BY THE TIME 9/11\nHAPPENED, I HAD SORT OF A NATURAL INCLINATION TO ADOPT\nTHE WORLD VIEW OF THE JIHADISTS THAT GAVE ME AN\nOPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS MY RAGE AND FRUSTRATION THROUGH\nA COUNTER CULTURAL MOVEMENT ALBEIT A VIOLENT ONE.\nTHAT PROCESS CONTINUED TO UNFOLD AND I CONTINUED TO\nGET DEEPER AND DEEPER IN TO THE IDEOLOGY OF AL QAEDA.\nAND EVENTUALLY GRADUATED FROM ROLE TO ROLE FIRST AS\nSTUDENT, ADHERENT AND THEN AS PROPAGANDIST.\n>> LET ME STOP YOU THERE. YOU ARE IN THE U.S.A.\nYOU DIDN'T GO TO PAKISTAN OR ANY OF THOSE PLACES.\nYOU'RE HERE IN THE UNITED STATES.\nAND YOU ARE WORKING WITH AL QAEDA HERE; IS THAT CORRECT?\n>> WELL THAT IS CORRECT. AT THE TIME AL QAEDA WAS\nCHANGING ITS STRATEGY. THEY WERE BECOMING LESS A\nTOP DOWN HIERARCHAL ORGANIZATION AND MORE\nCENTRALIZED WITH REGARD TO INSPIRING OTHERS TO TAKE UP\nTHE CAUSE. THEY WERE STRESSING THAT\nINDIVIDUALS EVERYWHERE NEEDED TO CONCENTRATE ON\nPROPAGATING THE IDEOLOGY THAT THAT WAS ONE OF THE\nWAYS THAT THEY WERE GOING TO SUSTAIN THEIR MOVEMENT.\nAND. >> AND WHERE WERE YOU DOING\nTHIS PHYSICALLY IN THE U.S.A.?\nWHERE WERE YOU? >> I WAS IN NEW YORK CITY.\nI STARTED WORKING ON BEHALF OF THE JIHADISTS IDEOLOGY\nAND PROPAGATING IN 2004. I WAS FIRST WITH SOCIETY AND\nTHEN I STARTED MY ENTITY. REVOLUTION MUSLIM IN LATE\n2007. RAN THAT UP UNTIL THE POINT\nOF MY INCARCERATION IN MAY OF 2011.\n>> WERE YOU WORRIED ABOUT THE FBI AND PEOPLE COMING\nAFTER YOU? WAS THAT A -- SOMETHING THAT\nYOU WERE WORRIED ABOUT HERE? >> WELL, IT WAS QUITE\nOBVIOUS THAT WE WERE CERTAINLY UNDER\nINVESTIGATION. BUT WE CAREFULLY ATTEMPTED\nTO TOE THE LINE BETWEEN FREE AND ILLEGAL SPEECH.\nWE BELIEVED WE WERE IN THE LOCALLY REALM OF THE LAW.\nAND SO, OF COURSE WE KNEW WE WERE BEING MONITORED BUT I\nTHINK THAT WHEN YOU ARE SO DRUNK ON AN IDEOLOGY AND\nCOMMITTED TO A CAUSE THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH\nACTIVISM BECOMES SOMETHING THAT YOU ACTUALLY ENJOY,\nBELIEVE IT OR NOT. >> CAT AND MASS MOIS GOT\nYOU. HOW MUCH TIME DID YOU SERVE.\n>> ORIGINALLY SENTENCED TO 11 AND A HALF YEARS.\nI WAS PICKED UP IN MAY OF 2011.\nUSAMA BIN LADEN WAS KILLED. I WAS AFFORDED THE\nOPPORTUNITY TO COOPERATE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT.\nI HAD MANY DIFFERENT VARIABLES THAT CONTRIBUTED\nTO DERADICALLIZATION AND ULTIMATELY THE JUDGE ON THE\nCASE WITH THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE PROSECUTOR RELEASED\nME AFTER THREE YEARS AND NINE MONTHS.\n>> FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE OTHER RADICAL --\nMUSLIM RADICALS, RIGHT? >> WELL, AFTER I DETERMINED\nTHAT THE IDEOLOGY I HAD WAS COMPLETELY FALSE, THERE WERE\nSTILL FACTIONS OF THE NETWORKS THAT WERE\nCONTINUING TO REACH OUT TO ME.\nON TOP OF THAT, I HAD ANALYTICAL ANALYSIS THAT WAS\nABLE TO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION IN HOW WE ASSESS RISK.\n>> ALL RIGHT SOWVMENT HELPED AGAINST THE JIHAD?\n>> IN MANY DIFFERENT CAPACITIES, YES.\n>> THEY CUT YOU SOME SLACK. NOW WHAT ARE YOU DOG AT\nGEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY?\n>> WELL, UPON MY RELEASE, A LOT OF STATEMENTS WERE\nCOMING FROM POLITICIANS LIKE THE PRESIDENT FROM THE HOUSE\nAND HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE.\nDIFFERENT FACTIONS OF THE POLICY COMMUNITY AND COUNTER\nTERRORISM COMMUNITY GENERALLY ABOUT THE VALUE OF\nFORMER EXTREMISTS. AND SO I DECIDED TO ATTEMPT\nTO FIND AN AVENUE BY WHICH I COULD OPERATE AS A FORMER IN\nTHE U.S. -- A PROGRAM ON EXTREMISM IS DOING.  SO BEST\nWORK IN THE FIELD OF COUNTERING VIOLENT EXTREMISM\nAND EDUCATING THE PUBLIC AND POLICYMAKERS ABOUT THAT.\nFOUND IT IN IDEAL HOME. AFTER A LONG PROCESS, I WAS\nHIRED. AND I HAVE BEEN GIVEN\nENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY -- >> --NOW YOU ARE WITH THE\nGOOD GUYS. >> ABSOLUTELY.\nI MEAN, MY WORLD VIEW HAS TOTALLY CHANGED.\nNOW I THINK RATIONALLY. >> THIS STORY, MR. MORTON IS\nAMAZING ON TWO LEVELS REDEMPTION.\n>> YES. >> WHICH WE BELIEVE IN HERE\nVERY MUCH. NUMBER TWO, NOW YOU ARE A\nPATRIOT. I HOPE.\nI HOPE YOU ARE HELPING TO PROTECT AMERICANS BECAUSE WE\nNEED ALL THE PROTECTION WE CAN GET.\nLAST WORD? >> I THINK AT THE END OF THE\nDAY YOU'RE RIGHT. I MEAN, I WAS ABLE TO\nREALIZE THE VALUE OF THE AMERICAN SYSTEM.\nI REALIZED NOW TODAY THAT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT WHO THEY\nARE. IT'S ABOUT WHO WE ARE.\n>> THAT'S RIGHT. >> WE HAVE A SYSTEM OF LIFE\nTHAT IS IN MANY WAYS PROVABLE AND ONE CAN LOOK AT\nIT FROM A FACTUAL STATUS AND SEE THAT THE AMERICAN\nSYSTEM, DEMOCRACY, LIBERALISM, AND FREEDOM IS A\nWAY THAT LIBERATES EVERYBODY.\n>> THANK YOU, MR. MORTON, FASCINATING STORY.\nGOOD LUCK TO YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nWHEN WE COME RIGHT BACK, A FACTOR INVESTIGATION.\nIS THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HIDING THE REAL STORY ABOUT\nILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ON THE BORDER?\nTHAT REPORT MOMENTS AWAY.\n  NOW THAT FEDEX HAS HELPED US\n    SIMPLIFY OUR E-COMMERCE, WE COULD FOCUS ON BIGGER ISSUES,",

I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT A RED\nCROSS DISASTER TRUCK HAS PULLED IN ON 23rd STREET.\nTHEY'RE JUST SITTING HERE BUT THEY HAVE POSITIONED THEMSELVES\nAND ALSO AN EMS ACTIVATION LOGISTICAL SUPPORT UNIT ARRIVED\nSOME TIME AGO. EVERYONE IS IN PLACE AND WAITING\nRIGHT NOW. WE ARE STILL HEARING HELICOPTERS\nABOVE US, BUT WHEREVER THIS DUMPSTER WAS ABOUT A BLOCK AWAY\nFROM ME, WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT WAS SURROUNDING IT.\nBUT THEY SAID THEY SEARCHED THE BUILDINGS THAT WERE CLOSE TO THE\nDUMPSTER. THEY DID NOT HAVE TO EVACUATE.\nWE DON'T KNOW IF PEOPLE WERE RESIDING RIGHT THERE OR IF IT'S\nOFFICE BUILDINGS. IT'S SORT OF A MIXTURE OF RETAIL\nSHOPS HERE, SOME RESIDENTIAL. SOME BUSINESSES OBVIOUSLY CLOSED\nTONIGHT. THE PEOPLE OF NEW YORK CITY ARE\nSTANDING AS CLOSE AS THEY CAN GET TO THAT SCENE, BECAUSE THEY\nWANT SOME ANSWERS, TOO. AND SEVEN JUST WAITING AS LAW\nENFORCEMENT OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS, STATES PARTNERS\nCONTINUE TO BE RIGHTS HERE EVALUATING WHAT EXACTLY HAS\nHAPPENED. MOST IMPORTANTLY OF ALL, BY\nWHOM. >> YEAH, EXACTLY.\nTHANKS, JEAN. >> THANK YOU FOR THAT, JEAN.\nLET'S GO TO OUR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT WHO'S BEEN\nSPEAKING WITH HIS SOURCES. MAJOR DEVELOPMENT, EVAN, IN THE\nLAST HALF-HOUR, THE FACT THAT YOU AND YOUR TEAM HAVE CONFIRMED\nTHAT THEY HAVE FOUND THIS SECONDARY DEVICE AT WEST 27th\nSTREET, A PRESSURE COOKER WITH COLORED WIRING COMING OUT OF IT,\nDUCT TAPE, A SMALL DARK COLORED DEVICE ATTACHED TO THE OUTSIDE,\nCOULD BE A TONY, COULD BE A TIMER, AND FINALLY, A PIECE OF\nPAPER WITH WRITING ON ITS. ANY IDEA WHAT THAT IS?\nIS THAT A NOTE? WHAT IS IT TELLING AUTHORITIES?\n>> RIGHT. IT'S NOT CLEAR.\nCERTAINLY AUTHORITIES ARE NOT TELLING US WHAT THE WRITING IS\nON THIS DEVICE. LOOK, I THINK THE REASON WHY\nWE'RE TREATING THIS AND THE AUTHORITIES THERE ARE TREATING\nIT WITH THE SERIOUSNESS THAT THEY ARE, IS BECAUSE IT BRINGS\nUS TO REMINDERS OF WHAT HAPPENED IN BOSTON DURING THE PATRIOT\nDAY, THE BOSTON MARATHON BOMBINGS THAT OCCURRED USING THE\nSAME TYPE OF DEVICE, A PRESSURE COOKER.\nIN THAT CASE WAS AN EXPLOSIVE AND THEY HAD RIGGED IT TO\nINCLUDE NAILS AND OTHER PROJECT I'LLS TO CARRY OUT MORE CARNAGE,\nDO MORE HARM. WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT\nWHAT'S INSIDE THIS PRESSURE COOKER THAT WAS FOUND WITH --\nSCENE AN IMAGE OF IT. IT APPEARS TO BE NOT A VERY\nLARGE PRESSURE COOKER. AS SHE MOAN TWAB DESCRIBING, IT\nAPPEARS TO HAVE DUCT TAKE AND WIRES AND A CELL PHONE OR AT\nLEAST ONE OFFICIAL DESCRIBED IT TO BE.\n>> EVAN, WE HAVE JUST RECEIVED AN IMAGE OF THAT.\nLET'S PUT IT UP FOR OUR VIEWERS SO THEY CAN SEE IT FOR THE FIRST\nTIME. YOU HAVE IT.\nEVAN, JUST WALK US THROUGH THIS. >> RIGHT.\nEXACTLY. >> COULD YOU HAVE THE CONTROL\nROOM ZOOM IN ON THAT? GO ON -- YEAH.\n>> RIGHT. >> THE POLICE, THE NYPD WERE\nTRYING TO PUT A PIECE OF PAPER SO THEY COULD TRY TO GIVE IT\nSOME SCALE. AGAIN, MY ESTIMATE INITIALLY WAS\nJUST LOOKING FROM THE -- AT THE PICTURE WAS FROM -- THIS IS THE\nIMAGE WE WERE LOOKING AT EARLIER THAT IT WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD\nOF TEN, YOU KNOW, QUARTERS OR SO.\nBUT I'M NOT SURE. IT'S HARD TO GET A SCALE FROM\nJUST THIS IMAGE. YOU CAN SEE A GARBAGE BAG, A\nWHITE SIMPLE KITCHEN GARBAGE BAG THAT IT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN\nFOUND IN. THAT'S AGAIN WHAT THE\nAUTHORITIES -- WHY IMMEDIATELY THEY'VE CORDONED THIS ENTIRE\nAREA, AND AS WE'VE SHOWN IMAGES ON THE TV THERE -- THERE YOU SEE\nTHE CLOSER, THE WIRES COMING FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE DEVICE.\nYOU SEE THAT. THE CELL PHONE IS SORT OF\nATTACHED THERE ON THE FRONT SIDE, ON THE SIDE OF THE DEVICE.\nTHAT'S WHAT'S BEEN DESCRIBED TO US.\nI THINK WHAT THE AUTHORITIES ARE MINDFUL OF IS THAT THIS SUGGESTS\nSOME KIND OF SOPHISTICATION, IF IT DOES TURN OUT TO BE A BOMB,\nIT TAKES A LITTLE MORE WORK THAN SOMEONE WHO JUST PUTS TOGETHER A\nPIPE BOMB. AND THAT'S WHAT'S WHAT THEY'VE\nBEEN DEALING WITH ALL DAY TODAY. >> TALK ABOUT THE LEVEL OF\nSOPHISTICATION TO MAKE ONE OF THESE DEVICES.\nWHAT DOES IT TAKE? >> ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE USING A\nPHONE, ICE NOT CLEAR IF THEY WERE USING IT AS A TIMING DEVICE\nOR TO DEBT NATE IT WITH A PHONE CALL.\nAGAIN, THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT IMMEDIATELY COME TO OUR MINDS.\nWE DON'T KNOW THE ANSWERS TO THOSE QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW.\nTHAT'S WHAT THE BOMB DECK ANYTHINGS WILL BE EXAMINING TO\nFIGURE OUT IF THIS DEVICE WOULD HAVE WORKED, IF IT HAD\nDETONATED, IF SOMETHING WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE HERE.\nIT'S NOT JUST PUTTING TOGETHER A RUDEMENTRY PIPE BOMB.\nTHERE'S RECIPES. YOU CAN FIND THEM ON THE\nINTERNET. SOME PEOPLE ARE BETTER AT THEM.\nIN THE CASE OF THE BOSTON BOMBINGS, THEY WORKED.\nIN OTHER CASES PEOPLE TAKE SHORT CUTS AND THE H EXPLOSIVES OR THE\nTIMING DEVICES DON'T WORK. SO WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S INSIDE\nTHIS PRESSURE COOKER, BUT IT IS SOMETHING THEY OBVIOUSLY WANT TO\nPRESERVE AS MUCH OF IT AS POSSIBLE SO THEY CAN SEE HOW IT\nWAS PUT TOGETHER AND THEY CAN GET FINGERPRINTS AND PUT\nTOGETHER WHERE THE COMPONENTS CAME FROM.\nTHE PRESSURE COOKERS -- >> CAN YOU STAND BY, EVAN?\nSOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT I WANT TO SHOW OUR VIEWERS.\nTHIS IS AN IMAGE FROM THE EXPLOSION.\nWE'LL GET BACK TO YOU. BUT AGAIN AN IMAGE OF THE\nEXPLOSION. >> WOW.\nDON AND I ARE WATCHING THIS ON THE AIR WITH YOU ALL FOR THE\nFIRST TIME. >> CAN WE REPLAY THAT?\nTHERE'S NO SOUND, I WOULD IMAGINE.\nBUT LET'S LOOK AT THAT. YOU CAN SEE PEOPLE OUTSIDE\nRUNNING. >> ALL RIGHT.\nTHIS IS THE FIRST VIDEO. IT'S VERY SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE\nTHIS IS THE FIRST VIDEO WE'VE SEEN OF THE EXPLOSION AT WEST\n23rd STREET AT 8: 40 P.M. >> THERE'S THE OUTSIDE.\n>> RIGHT. THERE'S OUTSIDE.\nLOOK AT THAT. YOU SEE PEOPLE RUNNING,\nOBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW, TERRIFIED. WE HEARD THIS EXPLOSION WAS TO\nLOUD, SOME PEOPLE HEARD IT ACROSS THE RIVER IN HOBOKEN.\nWE HAVE FULL TEAM COVERAGE. >> LET'S DESCRIBE SOME OF THIS\nVIDEO FIRST. THIS IS FROM ORANGE FITNESS IN\nCHELSEA. AND SO THIS IS AGAIN -- WHAT WE\nHAVE HERE, IT'S ABOUT OBVIOUSLY FIVE TO TEN SECONDS OF THIS\nVIDEO. THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT\nSURVEILLANCE VIDEOS OF THE ORANGE FITNESS.\nONE IS FROM THE OUTSIDE. THE OTHER SHOWS INSIDE.\nTHIS IS THE IS THE OUTSIDE. IT'S NOT ONLY SURVEILLANCE VIDEO\nFROM THE FITNESS CENTER BUT IT ALSO COMES FROM MSNBC, SO AGAIN\nWE NEED TO MAKE THAT VERY CLEAR HERE.\nTHE SURVEILLANCE VOERKSD BECAUSE THIS IS GOING TO BE USEFUL IN\nTHE INVESTIGATION AS WELL. THIS VIDEO COMING FROM ORIGINAL\nTHERAPY FITNESS CHELSEA, ALSO FROM MSNBC.\nIT SHOWS THE INSIDE AND IT SHOWS THE OUTSIDE.\nYOU CAN SEE IT THERE. IT APPEARS TO SHATTER THE\nWINDOW. AS YOU LOOK FROM THE INSIDE OUT,\nYOU SEE PEOPLE RUNNING AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S\nHAPPENING. AS WE GO TO THE OUTSIDE VIDEO --\nPEOPLE ARE SCATTERING. AS WE GO TO THE OUTSIDE, YOU CAN\nSEE IT. >> MATTHEW IS HERE WITH US, A\nLAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST. YOU'RE A RETIRED ATF AGENT.\nYOU SPECIALIZED IN FIREARMS AND EXPLOSIVES INVESTIGATIONS.\nAS YOU WATCH THIS VIDEO WITH US FOR THE FIRST TIME, WHAT DO YOU\nSEE? WHAT DOES IT TELL YOU?\n>> WELL, YOU KNOW, THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE A CERTAIN\nMEASURE OF CHAOS WHEN THESE THINGS HAPPEN, BUT AS YOU SEE\nWHAT HAPPENED TOMORROW, YOU HAD THAT ONE INCIDENT.\nOUR MAJOR CONCERN IS IF THERE'S A SECONDARY OR TER SH AIR\nINCIDENT AND AT THE LEAST, WE HAVE A SECONDARY INCIDENT.\nWE WON'T BE ABLE TO TELL THE THIEP EXPLOSION THAT WAS USED\nAND GET A SENSE FOR WHAT KIND OF DEVICE IT IS.\nBUT THIS IS A GOOD EARLY START AND THE POLICE WILL BE WORKING\nWITH THE CAMERA OWNERS. >> THIS IS A SURVEILLANCE VIDEO\nWE HAVE FROM ORIGINAL THEORY, I SHOULD SAY, FITNESS IN CHELSEA.\nTHE OUTSIDE AS -- AFTER THE EXPLOSION HAPPENED AND THE\nINSIDE AS THE EXPLOSION HAPPENED.\nTHIS IS FROM THEM. WE'RE USING IT FROM MSNBC,\nBECAUSE NO DOUBT, THIS IS PART OF THE STORY AND PART OF THE\nINVESTIGATION. WE'LL BE BACK IN JUST MOMENTS\nWITH OUR LIVE COVERAGE OF THE EXPLOSION IN MANHATTAN.",

ALL RIGHT.\nIT'S GOING TO BE A LARGE GROUP OF PEOPLE STILL.\nSO WITHOUT PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, PICTURES, AS I WAS SAYING\nEARLIER, IS THERE EVIDENCE ON THE BODIES OF THOSE NOW IN\nJAIL -- IN THE HOSPITALS IN TERMS OF SHRAPNEL.\nALL OF THOSE WILL HAVE TO BE INVESTIGATED.\nSO UNFORTUNATELY, THIS DOES NOT -- THIS IMAGE ALONE TELLS ME\nTHIS IS TWO THINGS. THIS IS PURPOSEFUL.\nTHE THESE THINGS DON'T JUST GET MADE.\nTHERE IS SOME DISCUSSION OF WRITING.\nOBVIOUSLY, EVERYONE'S VERY CURIOUS ABOUT THAT, WHAT DOES\nTHAT SAY, WHAT LANGUAGE IS IT IN AND OTHER ISSUES THAT WE'LL BE\nFOCUSED ON AND REPORTERS WILL BE LOOKING INTO BUT UNFORTUNATELY,\nIT DOESN'T NARROW DOWN ANYTHING. THAT'S THE CHALLENGE ABOUT --\nTHAT THE NYPD IS FACING TODAY IS IN A WORLD OF SOFT TARGETS AND\nTHE CAPACITY TO BUILD MAKESHIFT WEAPONRY, LET ALONE WEAPONRY\nTHAT ALREADY EXISTS, THEY HAVE TO GO ON OTHER TYPES OF\nEVIDENCE. I JUST WANT TO ADD ONE MORE\nTHING QUICKLY. YOU'RE LOOKING ALSO BECAUSE IT\nWAS NOT DETONATED, THERE MIGHT BE FINGER PRINTS, THERE MIGHT BE\nPROOF OF PURCHASE, THERE MIGHT BE OTHER THINGS THAT CAN LEAD\nTHE INVESTIGATION, NYPD, VERY SOPHISTICATED POLICE DEPARTMENT\nWITH A STRONG KOUNTDER TERRORISM UNIT.\nI HAVE HIGH CONFIDENCE THAT THAT'S BEING DONE NOW.\n>> SO MATTHEW JOINS US BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT ONLY A LAW\nENFORCEMENT ANALYST BUT YOU WERE FORMERLY WITH THE ATF.\nEXPLOSIVES IS YOUR EXPERTISE. WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO BUILD\nSOMETHING LIKE THIS PRESSURE COOKER AND MAKE IT INTO WHAT\nAPPEARS TO BE SOMETHING TO DETONATE.\nLET'S LOOK AT IT AND TALK ABOUT IT.\n>> INVESTIGATORS DON'T TAKE ANYTHING FOR GRANTED WHEN IT\nCOMES TO INVESTIGATING DEVICES LIKE THIS AND THE SOPHISTICATION\nOR COMPLEXITY OF IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE DEVICES WITH ONLY AS\nCOMPLICATED AS THE IMAGINATION OF THE BOMBER.\nTHIS DEVICE COULD VERY WELL BE A HOAX DEVICE AND WE CAN'T SAY\nIT'S AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE UNTIL WE'VE TAKEN IT APART, IDENTIFIED\nIN IT AN EXPLOSIVE ELEMENT AND CLASSIFIED IT AS AN EXPLOSIVE\nDEVICE. >> HERE'S WHAT I'M HEARING FROM\nONE OF MY SOURCES. THEY CAN NARROW DOWN THE BOMB\nMAKER BUT PULLING LATENT FINGERPRINTS.\nANY COMPONENTS CAN BE TRACKED BACK TO THE MANUFACTURERS AND\nWHO PURCHASED IT. LE.\n>> LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I'VE SEEP IN MY CAREER, DON.\nFINGERPRINTS CAN DRAWN FROM INSIDE OF THE PRESSURE COOKER OR\nA PIPE BOMB, THE TYPE OF WIRE OR EXPLOSIVE POWDER THAT WAS USED,\nWE TRACE THAT RIGHT BACK TO THE SELLING STORE AND USED CAMERA\nAND RECEIPTS TO DRILL DOWN AS TO WHO MAY HAVE PURCHASED THOSE\nTEARS MATERIALS. >> ALL RIGHT, STAY WITH US.\nWE HAVE FULL TEAM COVERAGE OF THIS.\nWE'RE GOING TO GET A QUICK BREAK IN.\nMORE NEWS ON THIS EXPLOSION.

ONE IN CRITICAL CONDITION.\nSUBSEQUENT TO THIS, A SECONDARY DEVICE FOUND FOUR BLOCKS AWAY.\nA PRESSURE COOKER WITH WIRES COMING OUT OF IT AND DUCTS TAPE\nWITH A BLACK DEVICE TAPED TO BE POSSIBLY A CELL PHONE OR A\nTIMER. THIS HAPPENING IN NEW YORK CITY\nON A BUSY SATURDAY EVENING. LET'S BRING IN OUR CNN CRIME AND\nJUSTICE PRODUCER. HE'S IN WASHINGTON, D.C. WITH US\nALONG WITH OUR CRIME AND JUSTICES REPORTER.\nYOU'VE BEEN BREAKING NEWS ON THIS ALL NIGHT LONG.\nYOU RECEIVED THAT PHOTO. LET'S PULL IT UP AND TALK ABOUT\nTHE SOPHISTICATION OF THIS DEVICE.\nIF WE MOW, EVAN, WHERE IT IS RIGHT NOW.\nMEANING HAVE THE AUTHORITIES REMOVED IT YET?\n>> WE DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT, POPPY, WHETHER IT'S BEEN MOVED\nTO A LOCATION WHERE THE TECHNICIANS CAN GET TO IT AND\nSTART GETTING TO SEE WHAT EXACTLY IS IN IT, HOW IT WAS\nMADE AND TRY TO DO THE V INVESTIGATIVE WORK.\nTHERE'S OFTEN SERIAL NUMBERS, INFORMATION THEY CAN USE TO\nFIGURE OUT WHERE IT WAS BOUGHT. THAT'S THE WAY THEY'RE ABLE TO\nSOLVE AND FIND THE BOMBING -- THE SFEUSPECTS IN THE BOSTON\nBOMBING. THAT IS WHAT IS THE TOP PRIORITY\nFOR THE INVESTIGATORS IN THIS CASE.\nYOU WANT TO FIND AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WHERE THIS DEVICE WAS\nBOUGHT AND TRY TO SEE IF YOU CAN CONNECT THAT WITH ANYBODY WHO\nMAY HAVE BEEN NEAR THE SCENE TONIGHT IN CHELSEA WHERE THE\nFIRST EXPLOSION HAPPENED AND THIS WAS FOUND JUST ABOUT THREE\nOR FOUR BLOCKS AWAY. THE PICTURE WE'RE SHOWING, WE'RE\nSEEING IT WAS APPARENTLY PLACED IN THIS GARBAGE BAG.\nSOMEONE APPEARS TO HAVE SEEN IT. I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS POLICE OR\nSOMEBODY WALKING BY, BUT CERTAINLY IT'S TRIGGERED A LOT\nOF CONCERN FOR AUTHORITIES AND THAT'S THE REASON WHY WE'VE SEEN\nALL OVER NEW YORK PEOPLE ARE CERTAINLY NOW ON GUARD FOR OTHER\nSUSPICIOUS DEVICES. POLICE ARE LOOKING UNDER PARK\nBENCHES, CHECKING GARBAGE CANS, TRYING TO MAKE SURE THERE'S\nNOTHING ELSE OUT THERE THAT MIGHT CAUSE HARM TO PEOPLE IN\nNEW YORK CITY TONIGHT. >> SHIMONE, YOU'RE THE FIRST TO\nDESCRIBE IT FOR US. LET'S GO THROUGH SOME OF YOUR\nREPORTING. IT'S SAID IT IS DARK COLORED\nWIRING. IT IS EXACTLY AS UNITED STATES\nSAID IT. YOU SAID OFFICIALS HAD SEEN IT\nAND DESCRIBED IT TO YOU. WIRING COMING OUT OF THE TOP\nCENTER OF THE DEVICE, CONNECTED BY DUCT TAKE 25I7 TO A SMALL\nDEVICE ATTACHED TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE PRESSURE COOKER.\nLAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS WOULDN'T SAY AT THIS PINT WHAT\nWAS INSIDE THE PRESSURE COOKER. I IMAGINE THAT IS GOING TO BE\nTHE THING THAT PROBABLY GIVES THEM A LOT OF INFORMATION AS TO\nTHE INTENSITY AND JUST HOW STRONG THIS PARTICULAR DEVICE\nIS. THEN MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THEM\nASKING PEOPLE TO STAY AWAY FROM WINDOWS AS WELL, SIMONE.\n>> THE DEVICE ITSELF, I DON'T THINK THEY WERE DUB I THINK THE\nPLAN WAS TO TAKE IT TO THEIR WHERE THE BOMB SQUAD DETONATES\nTHESE THINGS IN THE BLOCS AND THEY WERE GOING TO SEE WHAT'S IN\nTHERE AT THAT POINT. I THINK THEY WERE JUST CONCERNED\nTHAT IT MIGHT BE EXPLOSIVE. THEY DO -- THEY WERE TREATING IT\nAS A BOMB, BECAUSE AS OF MAYBE EVEN ABOUT 30 MINUTES AGO OR SO,\nNOBODY CAN TELL US WHETHER IT WAS A HOAX, WHETHER IT WAS\nINERT, WHETHER THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THERE.\nI THINK THEY'RE TRYING STILL TO FIGURE THAT OUT.\nIT REMINDED PEOPLE OF THE BOSTON BOMBING, SO IT CERTAINLY HAS\nRAISED A LOT OF CONCERN IN NEW YORK CITY.\nAND THE BOMB SQUAD, THIS NYPD BOMB SQUAD IS THE BOMB SQUAD\nTHAT DEALT WITH THE TIMES SQUARE SITUATION WHERE A MAN LOADED A\nBUNCH OF EXPLOSIVES MANY A CAR THAT DIDN'T GO OFF.\nSO THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. THEY'RE PRETTY GOOD AT THIS AND\nTHEY'RE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO SORT OF HELP THIS\nINVESTIGATION, MAKE SURE THEY DON'T SCREW THIS INVESTIGATION\nUP. AND THE FBI IS WORKING WITH\nTHEM. RIGHT NOW THEY'RE TREATING THIS\nAS A BOMB. THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO SORT OF\nEXPLAIN THIS. AND THEY NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW\nTHIS WAS MADE AND WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF IT.\nRIGHT NOW, THERE'S NOTHING TO SAY DEFINITIVELY THAT THE TWO\nARE LINKED. THEY'RE STILL TRYING TO WORK\nTHROUGH THAT AND FIGURE OUT -- ALSO, MUCH LIKE THEY FOUND\nSURVEILLANCE VIDEO AT THE 23rd STREET LOCATION, THEY'RE\nPROBABLY LOOKING FOR SURVEILLANCE VIDEO ON 237th --\n27th STREET AND TO SEE HOW THIS GOT THERE.\nWE STILL DON'T KNOW WHO FOUND IT AND HOW THEY FOUND IT.\nTHE POLICE SEARCHED THE ENTIRE AREA AND MAY HAVE STUMBLED UPON\nIT. >> RIGHT.\n>> WE VICE PRESIDENT BEEN TOLD HOW THEY --\n>> THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN. >> WE'RE GOING TO GET A QUICK\nBREAK IN.

WAS IT A SEARCH?\nWAS IT AN INDIVIDUAL PEDESTRIAN SAYING LOOK THERE IS SOMETHING\nFUNKY A COUPLE BLOCKS AWAY? WAS IT -- ANY NUMBER OF WAYS.\nTHE WHEREIN REASON WHY I WANT TO KNOW THAT IS BECAUSE THEN IT\nWILL HELP ALL OF US DETERMINE LINKAGES BETWEEN THE FIRST AND\nTHE SECOND AND WHETHER THE N YNYPD\nHAS SOME FOCUS ON WHO THE CULPRIT OR CULPRITS COULD BE.\n>> OKAY. >> NOTHING WE HAVE SEEN TODAY IS\nGOING TO NARROW DOWN THE GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT THIS COULD\nPOSSIBLY BE.

AND WHAT WE FOUND IN THE\nPHILIPPINES IS WE WERE ABLE TO PULL THAT OFF AND GO THROUGH\nCALL RECORDS AND THE DIRECTORY AND IT WAS A BOONE FOR US.\nSO IF THIS WAS INTENDED TO GO OFF BUT DIDN'T, THAT CELL PHONE\nMIGHT BE AN IMMENSE INTELLIGENCE COUP.\n>> AND I HEARD FROM OUR PREVIOUS GUESTS THAT HAVE BEEN ON IN THE\nPREVIOUS HOURS, YOU KNOW, THE QUESTION, COULD IT BE A HOAX\nDEVICE?

THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF QUESTIONS\nTHAT OBVIOUSLY INVESTIGATORS WILL BE LOOKING INTO.\n>> STEVE, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE DEVICE ITSELF?\nIS THIS ANY KIND OF SOPHISTICATION?\nIS THIS ANYTHING SOMEONE COULD DO PRETTY EASILY JUST FROM\nLOOKING AT IT. >> YOU KNOW, THE RECIPE FOR --\nFOR A PRESSURE COOKER BOMB HAS BEEN ON THE ENTER -- NOT ON THE\nINTERNET BUT IT'S BEEN AVAILABLE SINCE 1971 WHEN THE ANARCHIST\nCOOKBOOK CAME OUT. SO IT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S\nNECESSARILY RELATED TO TERRORISM.\nALTHOUGH AL QAEDA'S MAGAZINE HAS PUT OUT SEVERAL OF THESE\nDESIGNS. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE\nSOPHISTICATED. THAT'S WHY THEY PUT IT OUT\nTHERE.

I'M NATALIE ALLEN ALONG WITH\nGEORGE HOWELL HERE FOR YOU. HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW A DEVICE\nFOUND A FEW STREETS FROM THE EXPLOSION EARLIER AT 8:40.\nTHIS IS THE DEVICE. IT APPEARS TO BE A PRESSURE\nCOOKER. SOURCES SAY WIRES COMING OUT OF\nIT WERE ATTACHED TO A CELL PHONE.\nPOLICE SAY THE BOMB SQUAD HAS NOW SAFELY REMOVED IT.\n>> NEW YORK'S MAYOR SAYING THE EXPLOSION SATURDAY NIGHT APPEARS\nTO BE INTENTIONAL OF THE AT LEAST 289 PEOPLE WOUNDED THERE.\nAND AUTHORITIES ARE URGING ANYONE WITH INFORMATION, ANYONE\nTHAT MIGHT HAVE SEEN ANYTHING TO COME FORWARD.\n>> APPARENTLY, AS WE HAVE BEEN REPORTING, IN THE VIDEO\nSURVEILLANCE THEY HAVE THEY DO SEE SOMEONE THAT LOOKS\nSUSPICION. THEY ARE CHECKING INTO THAT.\nTHAT'S THE FIRST WE HAVE HEARD OF A PERSON OF SUSPICION IN ALL\nTHE HOURS WE HAVE BEEN COVERING THE STORY.\nWE HAVE HEARD FROM A MAN WHO WAS IN THE AREA WITH HIS FAMILY.\nSO MANY PEOPLE OUT AND ABOUT. >> SATURDAY NIGHT.\n>> BEAUTIFUL NIGHT IN NEW YORK CITY.\nHE TALKED ABOUT WHAT OCCURRED. WE SPOKE WITH RYAN McMILLAN BY\nPHONE. HERE IT IS.\n>> I WAS ON THE CORNER OF 23rd AND SIXTH WITH MY WIFE AND TWO\nDAUGHTERS AND WE WERE JUST ABOUT TO GO ON THE SUBWAY.\nAND WE WERE LOITERING TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER WE SHOULD GO\nTO THE SUBWAY OR HAVE MY DAUGHTER GO TO THE BATHROOM AND\nTHERE WAS A HUGE EXPLOSION. THE BACK WINDOW OF A SUV POP\nOUT. WE RAN UP SIXTH AVENUE.\nNONE OF US WERE ROCK KNOCKED TO THE GROUND.\nIT WAS OBVIOUSLY VERY SHOCKING BUT IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE -- THERE\nWERE NO FIRES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.\nIT WAS A HUGE NOISE AND WE COULD SORT OF FEEL THE BLAST BUT -- IT\nWAS MOSTLY JUST SHOCK. AND WE JUST RAN, AND PEOPLE WERE\nSCREAMING AND RUNNING UP THE BLOCK.\nDEFINITELY SHOCKING. >> SO MANY OF THE EYEWITNESSS OR\nPEOPLE THERE WERE TELLING US HOW LOUD THIS WAS AND REPORTS THAT\nPEOPLE COULD HEAR IT IN HOBOKEN NEW JERSEY, THAT'S ACROSS THE\nHUDSON FROM THIS AREA AROUND CHELSEA.\nA SIGNIFICANT SOMETHING OR OTHER.\nWE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SOURCE OF IT.\n>> WE WERE SAYING, I MEAN IT IS A BUSY SATURDAY NIGHT IN NEW\nYORK. AND KEEP IN MIND THE WEATHER\nPLAYS INTO IT. IT'S BEEN REALLY WARM IN NEW\nYORK. THE WEATHER EXCELLENT TODAY.\nSOMAN PEOPLE OUTSIDE. THAT'S THE CONCERN.\nWHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN IN A CITY WITH SO\nMANY PEOPLE OUT ON THE STREETS. I WAS IN THAT VERY NEIGHBORHOOD\nA FEW DAYS AGO. TONS OF",

              "text": "I MADE THE SPECULATION, WHETHER\nOR NOT, ACCORDING TO ONE REPORT, THAT THIS WAS CONSTRUCTION\nMATERIALS, YOU KNOW, TO TRY TO GET THE TRUTH OUT THERE.\nEARLIER THIS EVENING, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP, WAY BEFORE\nAUTHORITIES CAME OUT, HE CALLED IT A BOMB.\nTONIGHT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, HILLARY CLINTON WAS ASKED ABOUT\nTHAT. SHE SAID EARLIER, BEFORE THIS\nNEWS CONFERENCE THAT WE JUST SAID, SHE SAID, IT'S IMPORTANT\nTO KNOW THE FACTS ABOUT ANY INCIDENT LIKE THIS AND WE\nCERTAINLY ARE LOOKING AT THE INVESTIGATORS TO DRY TO\nDETERMINE WHAT, YOU KNOW, DID HAPPEN.\nTRUMP COMES OUT AND SAYS IT'S A BOMB.\nAND LO AND BEHOLD, IT TURNS OUT IT'S SOME TYPE OF DEVICE ON THE\nSTREET OF NEW YORK, BECAUSE WE ARE LIVING IN A TIME OF TERROR.\nA TIME IN WHICH THIS IS A VERY REAL REALITY IN OUR LIVES, AND\nIT HAS NOW GONE UP ANOTHER STEP, TRAGICALLY AND SADLY.\nWE ARE FACING SOMEONE PUTTING BOMBS ON THE STREET CORNERS OF\nOUR CITY LIKE THEY HAVE ATTACKED ISRAEL FOR SO MANY YEARS.\n>> WE'VE SAID THIS ALL ALONG AND CONSISTENTLY THROUGHOUT THE FEW\nYEARS THAT THE BATTLEFIELD IS NO LONGER GOING TO BE IN THE MIDDLE\nEAST. THE BATTLEFIELD IS GOING TO BE\nHERE IN AMERICA. AND WHETHER IT'S AN ISLAMIC\nTERRORIST OR AN OVERSEAS CONNECTION, WHETHER IT'S A COPY\nCAT, YOU NAILED IT. IT'S A TERRORIST ATTACK.\nTHE MOTIVE HERE IS TO TERRORIZE US.\nAND IT BOILS DOWN TO, HOW DOE WITH STOP THIS?\nHOW DO WE PREVENT IT? HOW DO WE MINIMIZE IT?\nAND IT'S THE INTELLIGENCE GATHERING AND THE INFORMATION\nPROCEDURES THAT WE DEFINITELY HAVE TO UPGRADE THAT IN THIS\nCOUNTRY. >> OBVIOUSLY THE INFORMATIONAL\nPROCEDURES THAT YOU TALK ABOUT, WHETHER IT'S THE METADATA OR\nENTHUSIASM INTELLIGENCE FAILED TONIGHT.\nSOMEONE PUT SOMETHING IN THAT GARBAGE CAN THAT BLEW UP AND\nINJURED 29 PEOPLE. THANKFULLY, MOST NOT SERIOUSLY\nINJURED. WE'RE TOLD NOW THAT ONE HAS BEEN\nSERIOUSLY INJURED. CERTAINLY, SOMEONE COULD HAVE\nBEEN KILLED. THERE'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN A FAILING\nSOMEWHERE ON THIS, BUT HOW DO YOU FIND SOMEBODY WHO MAY BE IN\nTHEIR BASEMENT BUILDING A BOMB, DECIDING TO GO OUT AND DO THIS?\nLOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE BOMBING OF THE WORLD TRADE\nCENTER IN 1993. A CELL THAT WAS LED BY THE BLIND\nSHEIK, THEY WERE UNDER OUR NOSE. HE HE WAS TRIED AS A LONE\nGUNMAN. RASHEED BAJ SHOWS ARI HABERSTAM\nON THE A BROOKLYN BRIDGE. THEY SAID IT WAS A TRAFFIC\nDISPUTE AND ROAD RAGE. A PALESTINIAN MAN SHOOTS AND\nKILLS A YOUNG MAN ON THE DECK OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILD AND\nAUTHORITIES SAY IT'S A LONE GUNMAN AND NOW WE HAVE THIS\nPATTERN. >> TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, HOW\nDO WE PREVENT IT? WE HAVE CONSISTENTLY SAY, IF YOU\nSEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING. AND EVERY SINGLE INVESTIGATION\nCONDUCTED BY OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY WITH REGARD TO THESE\nINCIDENTS, SOMEONE SAW SOMETHING.\nSOMEONE SAW SOMETHING IN BERNARDINO.\nTHEY NEVER PICKED UP THE PHONE AND CALLED THE POLICE.\n>> WE'VE GOT THE VIDEO MONITORING AND LET ME INTERRUPT\nYOU FOR A SECOND. I'LL GO TO BRIAN LLENAS WHO'S AT\nTHE SITE OF THE SECOND SUSPECTED DEVICE ON 27th STREET, ABOUT\nFOUR BLOCKS AWAY FROM THE FIRST EXPLOSION.\nBRIAN, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT? >> Reporter: ERIC, THIS IS\nSITE OF WHERE WE THINK THERE'S A POSSIBLE SECOND DEVICE ON 27th\nBETWEEN 6th AND 7th. WE ARE ON 27th AND 7th.\nFOR ALL OF THE EVENING, WE WERE ON 24th AND 7th.\nSO THREE BLOCKS SOUTH OF HERE IS WHERE WE WERE.\nWE NOTICED THERE WERE NOT POLICE BLOCKING ANY OF THE STREETS.\nPOLICE WERE WALKING BETWEEN 24th AND 27th.\nBUT WHEN WE GOT HERE TO 27th, THIS IS THE SCENE WE'RE SEEING.\nYOU'VE GOT NYPD. THEY'RE KEEPING US BEHIND THE\nBARRICADES. WE'VE GOT THE BOMB SQUAD HERE.\nWE'VE GOT ONE MEMBER OF NYPD COME BY AND CHECK OUR BAG TO\nMAKE SURE IT WAS OUR BAG. WE ARE IN FRONT OF THE MUSEUM,\nTHE FASHION INSTITUTE MUSEUM HERE IN MIDTOWN.\nTHAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW.\nWE ARE ALSO NOW HEARING FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT, PETER DOOCY,\nSOURCES TELL HIM THAT THE SECOND DEVICE IS A PRESSURE COOKER.\nSOURCES TELLING OUR FOX NEWS'S PETER DOOCY THAT THAT SECOND\nDEVICE IS A PRESSURE COOKER. THAT IS SIGNIFICANT GIVEN THE\nBOSTON MARATHON BOMBINGS AND WE KNOW FROM THAT.\nBUT THAT IS WHAT WE ARE HEARING THE FROM OUR PETER DOOCY WITH\nTHAT. HERE, AGAIN, THIS IS WHAT WE'VE\nSEEN HERE ON BOTH SIDES. THE STREET IS CLOSED OFF.\nNOW, THE BLOCK LEADING UP TO HERE, AS I REPORTED, PEOPLE WERE\nABLE TO WALK IN BETWEEN. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MEANS THEY\nHAVE CLEARED THOSE STREETS. BUT ONLY THE CONCERN IS\nSPECIFICALLY NOW ON THIS BLOCK. WE'VE SEEN MORE AND MORE PEOPLE\nARRIVE HERE AT THIS LOCATION, 27th BETWEEN 6th AND 7th.\nTHE LIGHTS FROM TIMES SQUARE ARE VISIBLE FROM HERE AND PEOPLE ARE\nSTANDING BY ON THE BARRICADES TRYING TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING.\nWE'VE SEEN THE BOMB SQUAD, LIKE I SAID, AND THAT'S ABOUT IT,\nERIC. SIGNIFICANT INFORMATION FROM OUR\nPETER DOOCY AND WHAT WE SEE ON THE GROUND.\nIT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE TENSE THAN WHAT WAS SAW ON 24th AND\n7th, THAT'S FOR SURE. >> BRIAN, THAT CERTAINLY IS\nUNITED STATES UNDERSTANDABLE, CERTAINLY WITH PETER'S REPORT\nTHAT A PRESSURE COOKER WAS FOUND AT THAT SECOND SITE, POESHLY\nWAGZ THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE FIRST EXPLOSION WAS CAUSED BY A\nPRESSURE COOKER. THAT, OF COURSE, THE SAME TWO\nTYPES OF BOMBS, YOU POTENTIAL WILL HAVE TWO NOW HERE IN NEW\nYORK THAT WERE USED BY THE BROTHERS IN THE BOSTON MARATHON.\nSTEVE ROGERS, WHEN YOU HEAR THIS INFORMATION OF A POSSIBLE\nPRESSURE COOKER, HEAR THE INFORMATION OF A SECOND SITE\nNOW, POTENTIALLY, YOUR REACTION? WE'RE TRYING TO GET STEVE\nROGERS. HOPE HE'S UP THERE.\nTHAT CERTAINLY ADDS A NEW DIMENSION, A CHILLING DIMENSION\nTO WHAT'S BEEN UNFOLDING HERE IN NEW YORK CITY THIS EVENING.\nDEALING WITH A POTENTIAL PRESSURE COOKER AT ONE SITE, AN\nEXPLOSION PERHAPS CAUSED BY ANOTHER PRESSURE COOKER AT\nANOTHER. ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE\nLEARNED FROM THE BOSTON BOMBINGS THAT THIS STUFF IS AVAILABLE ON\nTHE INTERNET. AND THE AL QAEDA MAGAZINE HAS\nLAID OUT ALL THE WAYS YOU CAN BUILD A PRESSURE COOKER AT HOME\nAND DETONATE A BOMB. AND IN FACT, AL QAEDA HAS CALLED\nON TO DO THAT THROUGHOUT THESE YEARS.\nAND THIS IS THE TYPE OF STRATEGY INCLUDING AL QAEDA AND OTHERS\nELSEWHERE HAVE TRIED TO OY EMPLOY.\nSTRIKE AT THE HEART OF OUR COUNTRY, SEW TERROR IN OUR\nHEARTS INDISCRIMINATELY. AND THIS TONIGHT, LADIES AND\nGENTLEMEN, IS AN A EXAMPLE, POTENTIALLY, OF THAT SAME KIND\nOF STRATEGY ONGOING. WE'VE LOST STEVE ROGERS.\nSO ROD HASKELL, YOUR INSIGHT TONIGHT ON A POSSIBLE PRESSURE\nCOOKER AS A SECOND POSSIBLE DEVICE THAT WAS FOUND.\nAND THE FACT THAT AUTHORITIES SAY RIGHT NOW, THERE'S NO\nEVIDENCE OF A TERROR CONNECTION, BUT THEY DO SAY THIS WAS AN\nINTENTIONAL ACT. >> RIGHT, THIS SOUNDS LIKE IT IS\nVERY EARLY IN THE INVESTIGATION. THERE IS A LOT TO BE GLEANED\nFROM BOTH FORENSIC ANALYSIS OF THE DEBRIS THATGUFF\nINDICATORS AS TO PRECISELY THE TYPE OF EXPLOSIVE MATERIAL BEING\nUSED. MAY LIKELY TO PROVIDE INDICATORS\nOF SORT OF DETONATION MECHANISM, WHETHER THERE'S A BATTERY\nINVOLVED OR WHAT SORT OF INITIATION MECHANISM THAT WAS\nINVOLVED. MAY BE ABLE TO TELL US IF THERE\nIS A TIE TO THIS INCIDENT EARLIER TODAY IN SEASIDE PARK.\nAND YOU KNOW, THE POLICE AND FBI, JTTF WILL BE CANVASSING THE\nNEIGHBORHOOD TO SEE IF THERE WAS A BUSINESS DISPUTE IN THE\nVICINITY OF THIS. WAS THERE APPARENTLY DISPUTE?\nDID SOMEBODY IN THAT AREA -- >> I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU,\nBUT WOULD A BUSINESS OR PERSONAL DISPUTE PUT TWO BOMBS ON THE\nSTREETS OF NEW YORK TWO BLOCKS APART?\n>> VERY LIKELY COULD. IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE WHAT\nDRIVING HUMAN EMOTION COULD BE THE DRIVING FORCE HERE.\nBUT THAT DOES HAPPEN IN AMERICA. IT COULD BE TERRORISM OR ANY\nNUMBER OF THINGS. IT'S STILL EARLY ON.\n>> THE AUTHORITIES ARE BEING VERY CLOSE TO THE VEST IN TERMS\nOF WHAT THEY HAVE, BECAUSE THEY PROBABLY DON'T HAVE A LOT.\nTHE MAYOR DEPLASIO SAYING, IT WAS AN INTENTIONAL ACT.\nNO SPECIFIC CONNECTION TO THE JERSEY PIPE BOMB THAT WENT OFF\nEARLIER THIS MORNING AT THAT TARGETED MARINE 5K RAIN.\nWHAT COULD HAVE POTENTIALLY TELL YOU THAT WE DID HAVE A LIVE\nEXPLOSIVE DEVICE EXPLODE IN NEW JERSEY 14 HOURS AGO AND THEN NOT\n12 HOURS LATER AFTER THAT, YOU'VE GOT POTENTIALLY TWO\nEXPLOSIVE DEVICES ON THE STREETS OF NEW YORK.\nSOMEONE JUST PUTTING THEM ON THE STREET AND BLOWING THEM UP.\n>> AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT LOCATIONS THAT ARE PROBABLY LESS\nTHAN 75 MILES APART, MAYBELESS HAN THAT.\nSO YOU HAVE TO BE THINKING THAT THERE IS SOME LINK BETWEEN THE\nTWO. THAT THERE IS -- AGAIN, LAW\nENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATIONS WILL ALL BE SEARCHING IN THEIR\nRECORDS TO SEE, DO THEY HAVE INFORMATION THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT\nMIGHT BE SOMEBODY CONSTRUCTING A DEVICE ANYWHERE IN THE VICINITY\nOF THESE LOCATIONS. ANYTHING THAT TIES THESE TWO\nLOCATIONS TOGETHER AND TRYING TO DO THAT AT THE SAME TIME THAT\nTHEY ARE RUSHING THE FORENSICS SO THEY CAN HAVE A GOOD\nUNDERSTANDING OF WHAT -- EXPLOSIVE DEVICES SELDOM CON SUL\nEVERYTHING THEY'RE COMPOSED OF. SO THERE WILL BE THINGS LEFT\nBACK TO FORENSICALLY ANALYZE. AND IF THEY'RE GOING TO EXPEDITE\nTHAT, WHETHER THAT'S IN A LAB IN D.C., QUANTITY QUO, FBI'S LAB IN\nQUANTICO, OR AN NYPD LAB, THAR GOING TO BE DOING THAT WITH ALL\nDELIBERATE SPEED. >> I WANT TO BRING OUR VIEWERS\nUP TO DATE. SOME TYPE OF DEVICE WENT OFF NEW\nYORK CITY EARLIER THIS EVENING. AUTHORITIES NOW CONFIRMING WHAT\nTYPE OF DEVICE THAT IS. MAYOR DE BLASIO SAYING IT WAS AN\nINTELLIGENCE ACT. NO INDICATION OF TERRORISM AT\nTHIS POINT. AND A SECOND DEVICE FOUR BLOCKS\nAWAY. THE FIRST ON 23rd STREET, THE\nSECOND ON 22ENED STREET. OUR PETER DOOCY REPORTING THAT\nTHE SECOND DEVICE IS A PRESSURE COOKER, WHICH IS A CHILLING\nREVELATION WHICH BRIX BRINGS BACK WHAT HAPPENED TO THE\nBROTHERS IN THE BOSTON BOMBINGS. THE DEVICE THIS MORNING WAS A\nPIPE BOMB. WOULD IT MAKE SENSE OR AM I\nREADING TOO MUCH INTO IT IF ONE'S A PIPE BOMB AND ONE'S A\nPRESSURE COOKER THAT THESE ARE THE SAME PEOPLE OR MIGHT NOT BE.\n>> I DON'T THINK WE WOULD BE PRUDENT TO DRAW A CONCLUSION\nTHROUGH THAT. SAYS YOU RECALL, TSARNAEVS WERE\nUSING MULTIPLE FORMS OF EXPLOSIVES AND IT COULD BE\nREADILY AVAILABLE INFORMATION. IT COULD BE THAT THEY WERE\nTESTING DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT THEY HAVE.\nSO I THINK THERE'S A RANGE OF CHOICES HERE THAT THAT COULD\nTURN OUT BEING. AND OF COURSE, THERE COULD BE NO\nCONNECTION AT ALL, ALTHOUGH IT IS VERY UNUSUAL, BECAUSE WE\nDON'T HEAR ABOUT PIPE BOMBS DETONATING MUCH IN AMERICA, LET\nALONE AT AN EVENT WHERE THERE ARE MULTIPLE INJURIES OR IN NEW\nYORK CITY. SO I THINK THE TEMPORAL\nPROXIMITY OF THE TWO EVENTS, THE LOCATIONS BEING FAIRLY CLOSE\nTOGETHER WILL HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT LEADING FORWARD AND\nCOMPARING VERY QUICKLY WHAT WAS THE EXPLOSIVE MATERIAL.\nAND YOU KNOW, PARTICULARLY IN THE NEW YORK SITUATION, ONE\nWOULD EXPECT THAT THERE'S FAIRLY ROBUST VIDEO COVERAGE AND THAT\nVIDEO COVERAGE, IF YOU RECALL THE TSARNAEVS IN T BOSTON\nBOMBING, THE VIDEO UP THERE TOOK THOSE OFFENDERS BACK SEVERAL BLOCKS TO SEE WHERE THEY WERE\nCOMING FROM BEFORE AND WHERE THEY WERE GOING AFTERWARDS TO\nSEE IF THERE WERE OTHER LEADS AND THAT COULD BE GOING ON RIGHT\nNOW IN NEW YORK. >> YOU MENTIONED SOMETHING, WE\nHAVE NOT GONE THROUGH THIS IN NEW YORK CITY OR IN AMERICA FOR\nQUITE SOME TIME. BACK IN THE '60s AND 70s, IT WAS\nQUITE FREQUENT. YOU HAD THE FALN, THE PUERTO\nRICAN SEPARATIST TERRORIST GROUP.\nTHEY BLAMED FRANCIS TOWER, KILLING A BUNCH OF PEEP.\nTHAT'S WHERE PRESIDENT GEORGE WASHINGTON BID FAREWELL TO HIS\nTROOPS. A COLONIAL BUSINESS NEAR WALL\nSTREET. THAT WAS STRIKING AT THE HEART\nSUPPOSEDLY, AT THE PUERTO RICO INDEPENDENTS AND THE FINANCIAL\nDISTRICTS OF NEW YORK CITY. 1975, A BOMB PUT IN A LOCKER AT\nLaGUARDIA AIRPORT, 11 PEOPLE WERE KILLED.\nPOTENTIALLY CROATIAN TERRORISTS FAULTED FOR THAT, BUT AS I\nRECALL, NO ONE EVER ARRESTED. AND YOU HAD BLACK SEPTEMBER, THE\nPALESTINIAN TERRORIST GROUP ACTUALLY PUT TWO CARS WITH CAR\nBOMBS WHEREBY ONE ON THE STREET OF MANHATTAN ON FIFTH AVENUE BY\nST. PATRICK'S CATHEDRAL, THAT IN 1973, AND THE OTHER AT JFK\nBECAUSE OF THE ISRAEL SITUATION. SO WE HAVEN'T HAD THIS LOOMING\nFEAR AND LOOMING SPECTER OF BOMBS GOING OFF IN NEW YORK CITY\nPLACED BY SOMEONE. SO WHERE DO YOU THINK WE'RE\nGOING WITH THIS? AND HOW CAN WE POTENTIALLY STOP\nSOMEONE FROM PUTTING ONE ON THE STREET AND TRYING TO KILL\nPEOPLE? >> UNFORTUNATELY, IF YOU LOOK AT\nTHE RELATIVE EASE THAT ONE CAN CONSTRUCT A PIPE BOMB, TALKING\nABOUT SOMETHING THAT IS RELATIVELY SIMPLE TO DO,\nPARTICULARLY IF YOU USE HOBBY FUSE.\nIF YOU'RE NOT USING ANY TYPE OF COMPLICATED ELECTRONICS, THINK\nIN TERMS OF THE UNABOMBER, TED KACZYNSKI, OR ERIC RUDOLPH.\nKASZYNSKI BUILT VERY DIFFICULT BOMBS, VERY COMPLICATED\nCONSTRUCTION OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, BUT A SIMPLE PIPE BOMB\nIS FAIRLY EASY -- >> I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT, BUT\nYOU GOT \"INSPIRE\" MAGAZINE, THE AL QAEDA MAGAZINE, THEY PUBLISH\nCOOKING INSTRUCTIONS, BASICALLY, ON HOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN BOMB AND\nPLACE IT SOMEPLACE TO KILL THE INFIDELS.\n>> EXACTLY RIGHT. YOU LOOK NO FURTHER THAN THE\nINTERNET AND YOU'LL FIND IT, GOOGLE SEARCH IT AND YOU'LL FIND\nA DOZEN RECIPES FOR VERY SIMPLE THINGS.\nSO WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT\nA COUNTRY THIS SIZE, THE FACT THAT WE ARE A TARGET FROM ISIS\nAND MANY OTHERS AROUND THE GLOBE, PEOPLE LOCALLY, DOMESTIC\nHOBBYISTS WHO THEY THEY'RE CLEVER.\nSOME OF THEM WILL LOSE A FINGER OR HAVE SOME DEVICE ACCIDENTAL\nDETONATE ON THEM. IT HAPPENS TO SEASONED PEOPLE\nAND IT HAPPENS TO, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST DABBLING\nIN -- >> SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS,\nOBVIOUSLY, AUTHORITIES SAY THERE'S NO EVIDENCE, OF COURSE,\nIT'S SO EARLY, OF ANY TERROR CONNECTION, THAT THIS MAY NOT BE\nRADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. THIS MAY NOT BE, YOU KNOW, AL\nQAEDA INSPIRED, OR ISIS INSPIRED.\nEVEN THOUGH, CERTAINLY, THEY >> I'M THINKING HE LOOKS LIKE A\nKOOKY COLLEGE PROFESSOR. >> LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD BE\nFOOLISH TO EXCLUDE ANYTHING FROM THE RANGE OF POSSIBILITIES HERE\nFROM, YOU KNOW, SILLY ACT, YOU KNOW, KID, GOOFING OFF, TRYING\nSOMETHING OUT, RECALL, YOU HAD AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE GO OFF UNDER\nTHE FOOT OF A YOUNG MAN IN CENTRAL PARK.\n>> I HEARD THAT. I'M COMING TO WORK HERE AT FOX\nNEWS AND IT WAS A LOUD BOOM. I LOOKED AROUND AND I WAS IN THE\nCAR. DRIVING ON FIFTH AVENUE.\nI KIND OF STOPPED BECAUSE YOU WONDERED WHAT WAS THAT?\nYOU'RE NOT QUITE SURE WHAT IT IS.\nWERE THERE POLICE? NOTHING.\nTHERE WAS NOTHING. AUTHORITIES SAID IT WAS A WET\nFIRE WORK THAT HAD BEEN LEFT THERE.\nDOES IT SOUND TO YOU LIKE WET FIRE WORKS?\nTHEY FOUND MATCHES AND IT HAD BEEN RAINING THE NIGHT BEFORE.\nSOMEONE HAD, KIDS MAYBE FOOLING AROUND THERE?\n>> YES. THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE WET FIRE\nWORKS TO ME. MORE OFTEN THAN NOT, FIRE WORKS\nDON'T EXPLODE OR IGNITE AT ALL. SO I THINK THEY HAVE TO BE\nLOOKING AT THAT INCIDENT AS WELL, ANY FORENSICS GOING AND\nTHEY SEE CONSTRUCTION, THEY WILL TAKE THAT BACK AND TRY TO FIND\nOUT WHERE WHERE THE PARTS OF THIS DEVICE PURCHASED?\nIF THERE IS ANY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION LIKE THAT, TAKING IT\nBACK TO A SOURCE, LOOKING AT VIDEO AS WELL.\nI SUPPOSE THEY'LL HAVE SOMEONE IDENTIFY IT.\n>> RON HOSKO, RETIRED ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF THE FBI.\nSIR, WE'RE CONTINUING OUR COVERAGE HERE LIVE ON THE FOX\nNEWS CHANNEL PAST MIDNIGHT, EASTERN.\nESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE NEW INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE.\nAN INTENTIONAL ACT AS NEW YORK CITY MAYOR DE BLASIO, CERTAINLY\nNO EVIDENCE OF A TERROR CONNECTION, BUT YOUR GUT SAYS\nTHIS IS A TERRORIST ACT BECAUSE A SECOND POTENTIAL DEVICE HAS\nBEEN FOUND ONLY FOUR BLOCK AS WAY AND PETER DOOCY REPORTING\nTHAT SECOND DEVICE IS A PRESSURE COOKER, STEVE ROGERS WITH US\nEARLIER TODAY, YOU KNOW, STEVE, THROUGHOUT OUR COVERAGE, WHAT\nWE'VE GONE THROUGH IN DEALING WITH BOMBS.\nYEARS AGO, NEW YORK CITY IN THE 50s.\nHE PUT 33 BOMBS ON THE STREETS. 15 PEOPLE INJURED.\nKAD RAL REACTION. REVOLUTIONARIES OF THE WEATHER\nUNDER GROUND AND ON AND ON. DO YOU FEAR WE'RE NOW OPEN TO\nNEW CHAPTERS IN THE WAY TERRORISTS WILL BEGIN TO ATTACK\nUS? THEY WENT FROM AIRPLANES NOW\nBACK TO BOMBS. >> WELL, THERE IS NO QUESTION AS\nI SAID EARLIER, BATTLEFIELD HAS CHANGED FROM THE MIDDLE EAST TO\nTHE STREETS OF OUR CITY. IN THE MIDDLE EAST, THEIR\nCOMMAND CENTERS ARE BEING KNOCKED OUT.\nRON GAVE A GOOD ANALYSIS OVER WHAT POLICE HAVE TO LOOK FOR.\nEVEN THE HOBBYISTS. I THINK WE'RE NOW BEING\nCONDITIONED TO UNDERSTAND MOST PEOPLE WE'RE DEALING WITH NOW,\nAND AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED THEY'RE ALL TERRORISTS.\nEVEN THE COPY CATS. THE PEOPLE WE'RE DEALING WITH\nNOW -- >> STEVE, A COPY CAT.\nWHAT ARE THE CHANCES SOME GUY HAS TWO BOMBS IN THE BASEMENT IN\nA BUILDING IN NEW YORK AND SAW THE NEWS AND WENT OH, THERE IS A\nPIPE BOMB IN NEW JERSEY. I'M GOING TO DO THE SAME THING.\nIS THAT REALISTIC? >> THAT IS REALISTIC.\nIT COULD BE ANYTHING. THERE COULD BE PEOPLE BUILDING\nBOMBS AND THEY SAID LOOK. LET'S PLANT A BOMB HERE.\nTHIS IS REALITY OF WHAT WE HAVE TODAY.\nTHE QUESTION IS WHY ARE THEY BUILDING THESE BOMBS?\nWHAT IS THEIR REASON? WHAT IS THEIR MOTIVE?\nTHAT IS WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT. IS IT A HOBBY?\nLIKE RON SAID? LOOK.\nGO TO YOU TUBE. PUT UP BOMB MAKING.\nAND THERE IS A WAR BETWEEN THIS COUNTRY AND TERRORISM.\nWE HAVE A PROBLEM ON OUR HANDS AND THE WAY WE PREVENT IT, AND\nWE NEED TO GET THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY TO WAKE UP AND\nREALIZE THAT IF YOU SEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING.\nMOST INVESTIGATIONS WE SAY WHY DIDN'T I SAY SOMETHING IF I SAW\nSOMETHING? >> WHEN YOU SEE SOMEONE PUTTING\nSOMETHING IN A DUMPSTER, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO THINK?\nTHEY'RE THROWING SOMETHING AWAY. CONSTRUCTION WAS A DUMPSTER.\nYOU CAN SAY WHAT IS HE TRYING TO HIDE THERE?\n>> WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT. EVERY TIME SOMEBODY THROWS\nSOMETHING IN A GARBAGE CAN OR DUMPSTER YOU'RE NOT GOING TO\nTHINK TERRORISM RIGHT AWAY. IF I SAW SOMEONE PUT A KNAPSACK\nDOWN NEXT TO A DOORWAY AND WALK AWAY, I'D GET A COP REAL QUICK.\n>> HOW DO WE LIVE THAT WAY? WE'RE TOLD SEE SOMETHING, SAY\nSOMETHING. DO WE HAVE ENOUGH LAW\nENFORCEMENT TO COVER ALL THAT? >> WE PROBABLY DON'T BUT WE\nPROBABLY HAVE ENOUGH AT ONE POINT.\nTHIS IS WHAT THE ISRAELYS DO. THERE ARE NOT MANY ATTACKS\nTHERE. WE'RE ALL ENGAGED IN THIS WAR ON\nTERRORISM. IF PEOPLE SEE A LOT OF\nTRAFFICKING GOING IN AND OUT OF HOMES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT\nAND A LOT OF IMPORTANTLY -- >> YOUR POINT?\n>> YES. IMPORTANTLY, AND NOBODY SAYING\nANYTHING WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS INVOLVED.\nPOLICE FIND OUT THIS IS WHAT IS POSTED ON THE INTERNET.\nGUESS WHAT? NOBODY SAID ANYTHING.\n>> IN JULY WE'RE REPORTING ON WHAT LESSONS WE CAN LEARN FROM\nISRAEL. IN NEW YORK CITY THEY'VE GOT 300\nCAMERAS. HUNDREDS.\nEVERY CORNER. AND THERE IS A COMMAND POST.\nSO THEORETICALLY, WE HAVE CAMERAS DOWN IN THE FINANCIAL\nDISTRICT. WE TOOK THAT FROM LONDON.\nIF WE HAD A CAMERA ON THE POLL THEY CAN POTENTIALLY HAVE A\nVIDEO OF A SUSPECT. ARE WE THERE YET?\nIS THAT WHAT WE NEED? >> WE NEED TO GET THERE.\nTHEY DON'T HAVE PEOPLE CRYING CIVIL RIGHTS AND CONSTITUTIONAL\nRIGHTS. I WANT TO PROTECT EVERY RIGHT I\nHAVE. BUT JEWISH BLOOD HAS BEEN\nSPILLED ALL OVER THIS WORLD AND ISRAEL HAS BEEN SPILLED.\nTHEY GET IT AND UNDERSTAND AT TIMES YOU HAVE TO GIVE UP A\nLITTLE BIT OF YOUR RIGHTS IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE LIFE OF\nYOURSELF AND YOUR CHILDREN. AND THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE TO WAKE\nUP IN THIS COUNTRY ABOUT. WE HAVE TO SAY LOOK.\nWE ALL FIGHT FOR OUR FIRST AMENDMENT, SECOND AMENDMENT\nRIGHTS BUT WE HAVE TO FIGHT FOR SURVIVAL OF THE COUNTRY.\nIF THEY WANT TO LOOK INTO YOUR PHONE AND DO A SEARCH ON AN\nEMERGENCY BASIS, WE, AS POLICE OFFICERS, IF YOU SEE SOMETHING\nSUSPICIOUS, YOU CAN'T GO THERE WITH OUT A SEARCH WARRANT.\nYOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT. >> THIS IS PART OF A GIST OF THE\nCONTROVERSY OVER VIOLATIONS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF\nAMERICANS THAT THE ISRAELIS DON'T HAVE THAT HAS BEEN ONGOING\nIN TERMS OF THE FBI AND MEGADATA.\nYOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. >> YES.\n>> SO STEVE, I THANK YOU. STAY WITH US.\nWE'RE CONTINUING OUR COVERAGE HERE ON THE FOX NEWS CHANNEL OF\nWHAT POTENTIALLY WAS AT LEAST ONE, IF NOT TWO EXPLOSIVE\nDEVICES PLACED ON THE STREETS OF MANHATTAN TONIGHT.\nIT'S A LOVELY SATURDAY EVENING. HAPPENING IN THE CHELSEA\nNEIGHBORHOOD AREA. WE'RE GETTING READY TO GO TO HIM\nIN A FEW MOMENTS. WE'RE CONTINUING OUR COVERAGE OF\nWHAT WOULD BE AEW CHAPTER AND A VERY CHILLING AND SAD NEW ERA\nIN THE WAR ON TERRORISM AGAINST US, BOMBS ON THE STREETS OF OUR\nCITIES. >> HELLO, JUST AFTER MIDNIGHT\nHERE IN NEW YORK CITY. JUST THREE AND A HALF HOURS AGO\nAN EX-PLOWSIVE OF SOME SORT WENT OFF ON 21 STREET IN MANHATTAN,\nINJURING 29 PEOPLE, THANKFULLY, MOSTLY ONLY MINORLY INJURED.\nONE SERIOUSLY, WE'RE TOLD. THE MAYOR SAYS THIS WAS AN\nINTENTIONAL ATTACK. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF A\nSPECIFIC CONNECTION TO THE PIPE BOMB THAT WENT OFF IN NEW JERSEY\nTHIS MORNING OR SATURDAY MORNING AT 9:30 IN THE MORNING THAT\nTARGETED A 5 K RUN BEING HELD TO BENEFIT OUR U.S. MARINES.\nAUTHORITIES IN NEW YORK SAY THIS WAS NOT A GAS EXPLOSION.\nSOMEONE PUT SOMETHING INSIDE OF A DUMPSTER ON 23 STREET BETWEEN\n6TH AND 7TH AVENUE. THAT IS MAYOR DE BLASIO AND\nCOMMISSIONER O'NEIL. THIS COMES AS WE HAVE REPORTS\nHERE AT FOX NEWS THAT A POSSIBLE PRESSURE COOKER HAS BEEN FOUND\nIN THE SECOND SITE. THAT COMING IF OUR PETER DOOCY.\nTHIS WOULD RACE SPECULATION THAT WE HAVE A SITUATION THAT IS A\nCOPY OF THE JAHAR TSARNAEV BROTHERS, WAY TO EARLY TO\nDETERMINE IF THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IT IS.\nBUT IF A PRESSURE COOKER WAS FOUND, IN THE SECOND SITE THAT\nWOULD GIVE AUTHORITIES MORE CLUES IN ORDER TO TRY TO FIGURE\nOUT WHO DID THIS THIS EVENING. THIS DOES, IN A SENSE RAISE THE\nNEW POSSIBILITY THAT TERRORISM HAS BEEN RATCHETED UP IN OUR\nCOUNTRY FOR BOMBS ON THE STREETS OF NEW YORK AIMED AT KILLING\nINNOCENT PEOPLE. WE HAVE BEEN REPORTING FROM THE\nSCENE OF THE FIRST DEVICE. AUTHORITIES HAVEN'T TOLD US,\nWHAT EXPLODED ON 23 STREET NOW. >> HI, ERIC.\nWELL, JUST NEED TO TELL VIEWERS WE MAY LOSE CONNECTION BECAUSE\nOF OUR LIVE USE SITUATION. IF WE DO, WE'LL BE BACK ON AS\nSOON AS WE CAN. WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR A HALF HOUR\nOF THE SECOND LOCATION WHERE THE SECOND POSSIBLE DEVICE IS AND\nOUR PETER DOOCY HAS BEEN REPORTING IS IT A PRESSURE\nCOOKER? WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO VERIFY\nTHAT. THIS IS WHEN WE SEE.\nPOLICE CORDONED OFF 27TH STREET BETWEEN 26TH AND 27TH.\nON 23 AND 27TH, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MOVE BETWEEN.\nBETWEEN 27TH AND 26TH, POLICE HAVE CORDONED THAT OFF.\nWE'VE SEEN EXPLOSIVES LEAVE THIS AREA JUST ABOUT FIVE MINUTES\nAGO. THE KIND OF VEHICLE THAT CAN\nPROTECT AND PUT AN EXPLOSIVE INSIDE OF IT.\nIT'S ROUND AND YOU CAN PUT AN EXPLOSIVE IN THERE AND THAT\nVEHICLE PULLED IN AND ABOUT 15, 20 MINUTES LATER PULLED OUT AND\nLEFT THE SCENE. BUT THE PEOPLE ARE STILL HERE,\nRIGHT NOW, NYPD IS HERE ON THE SCENE.\nWHAT WE HEARD FROM THE PRESS CONFERENCE, THIS IS SET TO BE\nINTENTIONAL. NO CONNECTION TO TERROR.\nLET'S GO BACK TO WHAT ELSE MAYOR DE BLASIO SAID.\nTHERE WAS NO SMELL OF NATURAL GAS.\nOUR WITNESSES SAID THEY DIDN'T SMELL IT EITHER.\nTE SAID IT WAS AN INTENTIONAL THING AND HAPPENED OUTSIDE OF A\nBUILDING NOT INSIDE OF A BUILDING.\nOUR WITNESSES WERE SAYING THEY SAW THE EXPLOSION OUTSIDE OF A\nBUILDING.

THE GUY WOULD HAVE JUST DUMPED\n14 BLOCKS? HOW DO YOU THINK THIS SCENARIO\nPLAYED OUT? WHO DO YOU THINK IS RESPONSIBLE?\n>> WELL, FORENSICS ARE GOING TO TELL THAT STORY.\nOKAY? WE NEED TO GET FORENSICS DONE.\nAANALYSIS ON THE BOMB MAKING MATERIAL DONE IN NEW JERSEY AND\nNEW YORK. THERE MAY BE NO CONNECTION TO\nNEW JERSEY. >> I JUST WANT TO SAY.\nNEW JERSEY MEANS PIPE BOMB THAT DID GO OFF YESTERDAY MORNING\nSATURDAY MORNING JUST BEFORE 5 K RUN.\nNO ONE WAS INJURED BECAUSE BY THE GRACE OF GOD, NO ONE WAS\nRUNNING BY. THIS IS A TARGET TO TRY TO KILL\nINNOCENT AMERICAN WHO'S SUPPORT OUR MILITARY.\n>> EXACTLY. AND WE MIGHT FIND OUT THERE MAY\nBE A TERRORIST CONNECTED TO THAT.\nTHE MAYOR SAYING THERE MAY BE NO FOREIGN TERRORIST CONNECTION.\nIN MY VIEW, THE PRESSURE COOKER ON 27TH STREET, I BELIEVE IN MY\nVIEW JUST ON WHAT I'M SEEING AND HEARING MAY HAVE A CONNECTION TO\nTHE ' ON 23 STREET. SOUNDS LIKE THEY HAD TO CONTROL\nTHAT DETONATION IN IN THAT BOMB. IT'S GOOD THEY GOT IT FULL AT\nTHAT POINT. THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE\nEVIDENCE THAT WASN'T DESTROYED IN AN EXPLOSION.\nBUT THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS HAS TO BE WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO TO\nADDRESS THIS PROBLEM? WE HAVE TO BE VERY, VERY PRO\nACTIVE AND GIVE OUR LOCAL, FEDERAL AND STATE LAW\nENFORCEMENT AGENCIES EVERY TOOL THEY NEED TO FIGHT THIS WAR ON\nTERRORISM. >> IT IS A WAR AGAINST US.\nWHETHER WE WANT TO ADMIT THAT OR NOT.\nSHOTS WERE FIRED BY A RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORIST ON NOVEMBER\n5TH, 1990. AUTHORITIES TRIED HIM AS A LONE\nGUNMAN, FOUND OUT HE WAS PART OF A WIDER CELL.\nWE DON'T KNOW ANY CONNECTION. NO OFFICIAL INDICATION THAT THIS\nIS RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM OR DOMESTIC TERRORIST ATTACK BUT\nCERTAINLY IT IS TERRORISM IF YOU PUT A BOMB ON THE STREET OF A\nCITY AND IT GOES OFF. STEVE ROGERS THANK YOU.\nIF YOU STAY WITH US I WANT TO GO TO A SPECIAL GUEST.\nJOE CONNER JOINS US ON THE TELEPHONE.\nI HAVE A. >> GEORGE WASHINGTON BID\nFAREWELL TO HIS TROOPS. REPRESENTS WHAT WE STAND FOR AND\nBELIEVE IN AS AMERICANS AND THERE, THE FALN, THE RADICAL\nREVOLUTIONARIES DETONATED A BOMB.\nTHAT BOMB KILLED JOE'S FATHER, FRANK, ONLY 32 YEARS OLD AT THE\nTIME. JOE CONNER HAS BEEN AT THE FRONT\nOF DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE AS A VICTIM AND ADVOCATE AGAINST\nTERRORISM AND HE JOINS US TONIGHT.\nJOE, THANK YOU FOR CALLING IN. DO YOU FEAR THAT WE'RE ON THE\nCUSP OF A POTENTIAL TERRORIST ATTACK AND BOMBINGS OF THE SORT\nTHAT CLAIMED YOUR FATHER'S LIFE? >> THE WAY THE WORLD IS LOOKING\nNOW RESEMBLES LIKE IT DID IN THE 70s.\nIF YOU RECALL GROUPS LIKE THE WEATHER UNDERGROUND, FALN OF\nCOURSE THAT MURDERED MY FATHER, BLACK PANTHERS.\nTHERE WAS A WAVE OF COP KILLINGS AND ATTACKS AGAINST POLICE IN\nTHIS COUNTRY. AND AT THE SAME TIME, THERE WAS\nA WAVE OF BOMBING. WE GOT TO A POINT THERE WERE\nTHOUSANDS OF BOMBINGS A YEAR IN THE U.S. AND SOME WERE NOT\nLETHAL. AND THAT KILLED FOUR PEOPLE IN\n1975. COULD HAVE KILLED MORE, MEANT TO\nKILL A LOT MORE. BUT THE BOMB WAS MOVED BEFORE IT\nWENT OFF. MY DAD WAS MURDERED THAT DAY.\nBUT WE'RE KIND OF, IT IS REMINDING ME OF WHAT THE WORLD\nWAS LIKE AT THAT POINT. IT'S NOT A GOOD PLACE.\nTHERE ARE A LOT OF PARALLELS GOING ON HERE.\n>> IT'S VERY UNHINGING. TO EVENING, EXPRESSED THAT WE\nUSED TO HAVE BOMB DRILLS IN MY SCHOOL IN THE 60s.\nTHEY'D CALL IN A BOMB THREAT AND WE'D STAND AND WAIT.\nYOU MENTIONED BOMBS. 1969 TO 1970, READY FOR THIS?\nTHERE WERE, READY? 4330 BOMBINGS IN NEW YORK CITY.\nNOT NEW YORK CITY. >> UNITED STATES.\n>> UNITED STATES. >> LIKE 600 IN NEW YORK CITY AT\nONE POINT. 43 PEOPLE WERE KILLED.\nWE HAVE HAD A STATE OF BOMBINGS BUT IMMUNE NOW, IT'S COME BACK.\n>> THERE IS A BOOK CALLED DAYS OF RAGE.\nA BOMB WENT OFF IN A MOVIE THEATER.\nTHE PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE. THEY WANTED TO WATCH THE END OF\nTHE MOVIE. SO THEY WERE BECOMING IMMUNE TO\nBOMBINGS. NOW, WE'VE BECOME OPPOSITE.\nWE NEED TO FOCUS ON THESE GROUPS AND YOU KNOW, BLACK LIVES\nMATTER, THEIR CONNECTIONS SEEMS TO BE A PATRON SAINT, SHE\nMURDERED A NEW JERSEY COP. >> THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT\nANY GROUP, ANY POLITICAL GROUP, BLACK LIVES MATTER ANYTHING ELSE\nRESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN NEW YORK CITY\nTONIGHT. >> THAT IS TRUE.\n>> AS YOU KNOW, OR RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM BUT SIT\nTERRORISM. CHESAMAR FLED TO CUBA.\nSOMEONE SELLS IN CUBA NOW. HIS NAME IS WILLY MORALES.\nHE LOST TWO HANDS WHEN PUTTING THIS BOMB TOGETHER IN THE BRONX.\n>> HE WAS IN QUEENS. >> QUEENS, THANK YOU.\nAND HE IS UNDER PROTECTION OF THE CASTROS AND OUR PRESIDENT\nHAS GONE THERE TO CUBA AND EVERYTHING IS KUMBAYAH.\nTHE STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS THERE HAS BEEN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT\nEXTRADITING THEM. DO YOU THINK THIS COULD OR WOULD\nGET THEM BACK TO THE UNITED STATES TO FACE OUR AMERICAN\nJUSTICE? >> I HOPE SO.\nSOMETHING HAS GOT TO BRING THEM BACK.\nTHEY'RE DOWN THERE. MORALES BUILT THE BOMB THAT\nMURDERED MY FATHER. HIS COMMENTS WERE RELEASED BY\nTHE CLINTONS IN 1999 WHEN HILLARY WAS RUNNING FOR SENATOR\nFROM NEW YORK. >> INCARCERATED FALN DEFENDANT.\n>> YES. YES.\nSO LOOK THERE HAS TO BE A FOCUS ON FIGHTING A WAR, NOT ONLY ON\nISLAMIC TERRORISTS BUT ALL TERRORISTS.\nWHETHER THEY'RE PUERTO RICAN OR MUSLIM.\nIT'S NOT A WAR AGAINST MUSLIMS. IT'S A WAR AGAINST TERRORISTS.\nTERRORISM IS AN IDEA. AN ACT.\nTERRORISTS ARE THE PEOPLE THAT DO IT.\nWE NEED TO FOCUS OUR WAR AGAINST THE TERRORISTS NO MATTER WHERE\nTHEY ARE. IF THESE PEOPLE TURN OUT THEY\nWERE TERRORISTS, HOW MANY LONE WOLFS BECOME A PACK?\nWE NEED TO GIVE THESE POLICE ALL OF THE TOOLS.\nWE NEED TO ALLOW CIA AND FBI TO TALK TO EACH OTHER MORE AND NEED\nBETTER INFORMATION SCHAEFFERING AND NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE\nSURVEILLANCE NOT ONLY PEOPLE WHO COMMITTED MURDERS BUT ON\nSUSPICION. THAT INCLUDES THE MOSQUES AND\nTHEY KNEW MORALES AND CARLOS TORRES BUT THEY WEREN'T ALLOWED\nTO SURVEIL THEM. >> THAT IS VERY CONTROVERSIAL.\nMAYOR DE BLASIO WAS ELECTED IN PART BECAUSE OF THAT.\nAND IF YOU'RE TARGETING A GROUP ON RELIGION THAT IS WRONG.\n>> BUT IT'S NOT BASED SOLELY ON RELIGION.\nTHESE PLOTS ARE HATCHED IN THOSE AREAS. AND THE PEOPLE IN THE MOSQUES\nKNOW WHO THE BAD ACTORS ARE. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO\nTHOSE PEOPLE AND FIND OUT. IT'S NOT A SUICIDE PACT HERE.\nTHERE ARE SERIOUS PEOPLE THAT WANT TO KILL US AND THEY'RE\nDOING IT. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY'RE\nGIVING CONSIDERATIONS TO WOULD BE TERRORISTS BEFORE WORRYING\nABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\nIT HAS TO STOP. >> JOE, FINAL THOUGHT.\nYOU TALK ABOUT THEY WANT TO KILL US.\nSOMEONE DID TONIGHT. DID YOU THINK WE'D BE SEEING\nTHIS AGAIN? >> YOU KNOW, IN THE LAST FEW\nMONTHS AND YEARS I WOULD SAY WITH COP KILLINGS, THAT IS KIND\nOF WHAT MADE ME START THINKING ABOUT IT AGAIN.\nTHAT IS WHAT STARTED IT BACK THEN.\nTHIS WAS A WAR ON THE POLICE. AND WE'RE SEEING THE THINGS, THE\nPIGS AS THEY CALLED THEM. AND THESE BOMBS.\nIF WE DON'T ERADICATE THESE ACTORS THEY'LL COME BACK AGAIN.\nTHAT IS WHAT HAPPENED. >> JOE CONNER, THANK YOU FOR\nCOMING ON TONIGHT AND THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE THROUGH THE\nYEARS. YOU'RE A VICTIM OF TERRORISM BY\nTHE FALN WHO KILLED YOUR FATHER WHEN HE WAS ONLY 33 YEARS OLD.\nAND I THANK YOU FOR COMING ON TONIGHT.\n>> NO NEED TO THANK ME. I'M JUST DOING WHAT IS RIGHT.\n>> BLESS YOU. THANK YOU.\n>> TAKE CARE. >> BRIAN EUNICE IS ON 27TH\nSTREET. WHERE A REPORTED PRESSURE COOKER\nWAS FOUND. BRIAN, YOU'VE GOT NEW\nINFORMATION? >> HI, ERIC, YES.\nABOUT SIX MINUTES AGO, ALL CELL PHONES HERE WENT OFF AND RANG\nAND EMERGENCY ALERT THAT READ SUSPICIOUS PACKAGE RESIDENTS ON\nWEST 27TH STWEEN 6TH AND 7TH STAY AWAY FROM THE WINDOWS.\nTHIS IS AN EMERGENCY ALERT, THIS IS AN ALERT WE'D GET ON PERHAPS\nA AMBER ALERT OR FLASH FLOOD WARNING.\nTELLING PEOPLE TO STAY AWAY FROM THEIR WINDOWS.\nAT THE TIME THE NYPD RUSHED MEDIA TO THE SIDE HERE AND IT\nSOUNDED TO US LIKE A BOOM. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WAS.\nGIVEN THEY SENT AN EMERGENCY ALERT, TELLING PEOPLE TO STAY\nAWAY FROM THE WINDOWS IT COULD MEAN THE BOMB SQUAD IS THERE.\nWHETHER OR NOT IT WAS CONTROLLED OR NOT, THE FACT THEY'RE\nALERTING PEOPLE WOULD PRESUMELY LEAD ONE TO BELIEVE THEY KNEW\nTHERE WAS A SUSPICIOUS PACKAGE THERE.\nA PRESSURE COOKER. WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS AN\nEXPLOSIVE, WE DO NOT KNOW. FROM WHAT PETER DOOCY HAS BEEN\nREPORTING WE KNOW THE SECOND POSSIBLE EXPLOSIVE IS A PRESSURE\nCOOKER. THE ALERT GOES OUT.\nTELLING PEOPLE TO STAY AWAY FROM WINDOWS.\nWE HEARD A BOOM BEFORE THAT ALERT CAME UT.\nWE SAW AN ALERT ON TWITTER, TOO. A VERY ACTIVE SCENE HERE ON 27TH\nSTREET. THIS IS A RESIDENTIAL AREA AS\nWELL. PEOPLE DO LIVE HERE IN THE\nCHELSEA NEIGHBORHOOD. IT'S A FAIR POINT TO SAY THAT\nTHIS IS MIDTOWN MANHATTAN. WE'RE 15 BLOCKS SOUTH OF TIMES\nSQUARE BUT THERE ARE CAFES AND PHARMACIES AND BARS HERE, PEOPLE\nWERE ENJOYING THEIR SATURDAY NIGHT.\nWE'RE NOW TALKING ABOUT AN OVER FOUR-HOUR AFFAIR THAT BEGAN WITH\nAN EXPLOSION AT\u00c3\u0091i 8:30 P.M. ON AND SIXTH FOUR BLOCKS SOUTH OF\nHERE. WE HAVE FOLKS THAT DESCRIBED A\nLOUD EXPLOSION WITH SMOKE AND SAID SOMEBODY SAID THEY SAW A\nFIREBALL. AT 11:00 WE'RE ALERTED TO A\nAPOSSIBLE SECOND DEVICE HERE ON 27TH BETWEEN SIXTH AND SEVENTH.\nPOLICE HAVE BEEN HERE. AN EXPLOSIVE CONTAINMENT VEHICLE\nSHOWED UP, CAME IN, AND THEN, CAME OUT.\nAND THE CONTAINMENT VEHICLE IS DESIGNED TO BE ABLE TO HOLD AN\nEXPLOSIVE DEVICE, TO BE ABLE TO HOLD THE FORCE OF AN EXPLOSION.\nWE DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS A DEVICE INSIDE BUT WE\nDO KNOW IT WENT IN AND MINUTES LATER, IT LEFT.\n>> BRIAN, THERE ARE NOW MULTIPLE REPORTS THAT THERE WAS A DEVICE\nTHAT IT APPEARED TO BE, INCLUDE A CELL PHONE.\nSO YOU'RE DEALING WITH A REMOTE CONTROLLED DEVICE THAT COULD BE\nCONTROLLED WITH A CELL PHONE. THAT IS CLASSIC TERRORIST TYPE\nOF DEVICE THAT IS MANUFACTURED. WHETHER THAT IS PART OF A\nPRESSURE COOKER PETER DOOCY REPORTED OR THE DEVICE BEFORE,\nSOME TYPE OF DEVICE WITH A CELL PHONE, THAT CERTAINLY WOULD\nINDICATORORIST  -- INDICATE TERRORIST IMPLICATIONS.\n>> WOW. THAT IS INCREDIBLE INFORMATION\nTHAT THERE WAS A CELL PHONE THERE.\nEXACTLY. THE FACT THEY SENT OUT THIS\nALERT THEY WANTED PEOPLE TO BE AWARE OF THAT HERE.\nIT WAS INTERESTING TO GIVE PEOPLE A SENSE OF SECURED AREA.\nTHE FOUR BLOCKS AROUND THIS AREA, PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO WALK\nUP AND DOWN HERE 27TH ON 7TH AVENUE BUT IT IS A WALK UP AND\n7th AVENUE, SO CLEARLY A SUSPICIOUS PACKAGE OF SOME TYPE,\nTHEY BELIEVED, THEY PUSHED PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE WINDOWS.\nWHAT WE'RE SEEING ON THE SCENE HERE, BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT WE\nHAVE GOT, IT'S JUST VEHICLES, I THINK THEY PURPOSELY PUT THEM\nTHERE TO BLOCK OUR VIEW, BUT THIS IS WHERE IT'S HAPPENING\nRIGHT NOW, AND THE POLICE ARE JUST STANDING HERE AT THIS\nOPPONENT. WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING MORE THAN\nWHAT YOU ARE REPORTING HERE ON THE GROUND.\nONLY THAT WE DID HEAR THAT SOUND, 25, 30 MINUTES AGO AT\nTHIS POINT WHEN THEY MOVED US. >> LET ME POINT OUT FROM --\nENGINE 44 LOST ONE OF ITS FIREFIGHTERS ON 9/11.\nNOW THESE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN ARE BACK DISPATCHED AT THE SITE\nOF A ANOTHER POTENTIAL TERRORIST ATTACK HERE IN NEW YORK CITY.\nKEVIN BERRY JOINS US ON THE TELEPHONE, HE'S A FORMER HEAD\nSUPERVISOR OF THE BOMB SQUAD IN NEW YORK CITY.\nWHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT A REPORT OF A PRESSURE COOKER, MULTIPLE\nREPORTS OF SOME SORT OF DEVICE WITH A CELL PHONE ATTACHED.\nWALK US THROUGH WHAT THAT IS, WHAT IT MEANS AND THE\nSIGNIFICANCE OF THIS. >> I THINK WE SEED THE TREND AT\nTHIS POINT TO BE INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.\nIT CERTAINLY HAS THE EARMARKS OF IT.\nTHE CELL PHONE, THE PRESSURE COOKER, CERTAINLY BRING US INTO\nTHE INTERNATIONAL REALM AT THIS POINT.\n>> AND WHILE YOU SAY THAT? BECAUSE THAT'S THE PATTERN THAT\nTHEY USE? >> THE PRESSURE COOKERS ARE USED\nOVERSEAS VERY REDEDLY. AS COMMON AS CELL PHONES ARE TO\nTHE U.S., PRESSURE COOKER DEVICE OVERSEAS ARE THAT COMMON IN THAT\nMARKET OVER THERE. WE HAVE NOT SEEN THAT HERE SINCE\nI DON'T THINK SINCE BOSTON, SINCE THE BOMBING AT THE\nMARATHON. >> DID THEY USE, THE THEY USE A\nFIRE -- >> THEY USED A COMMERCIALLY\nPRODUCED FIREWORK, THERE'S THE CAPABILITY OF USING THAT WITH AN\nELECTRONIC DETONATION, AS FAR AS THE POTENTIAL FOR THE POWER OF\nTHE EXPLOSION. >> EARLIER TODAY, SATURDAY\nMORNING, THERE WAS A PIPE BOMB, THERE WAS A CONFIRMED PEOPLE\nBOMB IN NEW JERSEY THAT TARGETED THE MARINE 5K RUN, THAT COULD\nHAVE BEEN A PRESSURE COOKER, WE WERE TOLD IT WAS A PIPE BOMB.\nANY CONNECTION BASED ON YOUR GUT?\nTWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF DEVICES, POTENTIALLY?\n>> TOTALLY TWO TYPES OF DEVICES. IS THERE A CONNECTION?\nTHERE'S ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY. COULD THERE BE DIFFERENT CELLS\nACTIVATED REMOTE BY THE INTERNET, VERY GOOD POSSIBILITY.\nBUT THE FACT THAT YOU ALSO HAVE THE BOMB SQUAD BRINGING THE\nTOTAL CONTAINMENT VESSEL, THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THEY MAY\nHAVE REMOVED SOMETHING ALREADY THAT WAS SUSPECT.\n>> WHAT DO THEY DO WITH THAT? THAT'S A PART IN THE BRONX,\nWHERE THEY WOULD TAKE A BOMB AND DETONATE IT.\nWHY WOULD THEY HAVE CONTROLLED DETONATION ON SEVENTH STREET,\nDOES THAT DESTROY ALL THE EVIDENCE?\n>> WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS USING A CONTROLLED EXPLOSION, WHICH\nMEANS IS LOW IN PLACE, THAT IS TO DISRUPT ANY ELECTRONIC\nCIRCUITS, IF THERE WERE CELL PHONES INVOLVED, THEY COULD HAVE\nUSED JAMMING WHICH THEY HAVE THE CAPABILITY OF DOING.\n>> WHEN YOU SEE A PRESSURE COOKER RIGGED WITH WIRES AND A\nCELL PHONE, THIS IS WHAT AL QAEDA HAS PUT OUT THERE ON THE\nINTERNET AND PUT UP IN THEIR MAGAZINE \"INSPIRE.\"\nPOTENTIALLY ANYBODY CAN DO THIS BECAUSE YOU CAN GO OUT TO YOUR\nLOCAL HARDWARE STORE AND GET THESE TYPE OF MATERIALS.\nIS THERE ANY WAY TO PREVENT A GUY AT NIGHT PUTTING A PRESSURE\nCOOKER BOMB IN A BARGAIN CAN? HOW CAN WE STOP IT?\n>> IT'S VERY DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO STOP IT.\nWE HAVE TO GO BACK TO THAT PHRASE, IF YOU SEE SOMETHING, DO\nSOMETHING. THEY HAVE BEEN DOING THAT IN THE\nUK IN BRITAIN FOR THE PAST 40 YEARS, THEY USED TO HAVE\nADVERTISEMENTS THERE ON THE SUBWAY THERE, THE METRO IN\nLONDON. IF YOU SEE SOMETHING, SAY\nSOMETHING. THE PUBLIC IN THE UNITED STATES\nHAS TO BE AWARE OF THAT. AND HOPEFULLY THAT WILL BRING US\nTO A BREAK IN A CASE OR A POSSIBLE PLOT AND PREVENT IT.\n>> HOW DO WE CRACK THIS, THEY HAVE THE SERVICE VIDEO, THEY PUT\nOUT WHAT THEY SEE AND MAYBE THEY GET A PHONE CALL?\n>> THEY HAVE A LOT NOW SINCE 9/11, THE CAPABILITIES\nHAVE BEEN ENHANCED SINCE 9/11, THERE'S A GOOD POSSIBILITY OF\nTHAT. BUT THE FORENSICS, FOR THE\nRECOVERY OF THE SCENE AT THE DEVICE, THE COMPONENTS, ALL THAT\nWILL COME INTO PLAY. >> WHAT ALL ARE THEY LOOKING\nFOR? AS THE FORMER HEAD O BOMB SQUAD.\n>> I WASN'T THE HEAD. I WAS A DETECTIVE THERE.\nTHEY'RE GOING TO RECOVER EVERYTHING BESIDES VIDEO\nFORENSIC EVIDENCE, EVIDENCE ABOUT THE DEVICE, FINGERPRINTS,\nDNA, ANYTHING THAT THEY CAN REGARDING THE CONSTRUCTION OF\nTHE IED? >> WILL A BOMBMAKER USE GLOVES?  WILLIE MORALES.\nDIDN'T HE ACTUALLY SHAVE DOWN HIS FINGERPRINTS?\n>> THEY ACTUALLY HAD HIM IN THE BOMB FACTORY AND MAKING THE\nDEVICES AND THAT LED TO HIS ARREST.\nTHE SAD SITUATION IS THAT TWO DETECTIVES IN NEW YORK WERE\nSERIOUSLY INJURED IN 1982 ON NEW YEAR'S EVE.\nTHEY ARE STILL SUFFERING FROM THEIR INJURIES AND THE PEOPLE\nINVOLVED IN THAT EVENT WERE ACTUALLY PARDONED BY THE FORMER\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. >> YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FILN\nCONFLICTS AND THEIR RELEASED DURING BILL CLINTON'S RACE.\nHE'S BEEN VERY OUTSPOKEN ABOUT THAT.\nJUST A COUPLE OF MINUTES LEFT. >> IT JUST SO HAPPENED, WITH MY\nINDUCTION TO MAJOR BOMBINGS IN NEW YORK.\n>> MAJOR BOMBINGS IN NEW YORK. I HAVE RAISED THIS EARLIER THIS\nEVENING, IF THEY DON'T CATCH WHO DID THIS, I DON'T WANT TO BE TOO\nALARMIST, BUT WE'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL, AND WE HAVE GOT TO BE\nAWARE, THE '70S ARE BACK AND WE HAVE GOT THIS KIND OF STUFF.\n>> THIS MAY BE A WAVE, NEW YORK AS YOU KNOW, IS THE CAPITAL OF\nTHE WORLD WHEN IT COMES TO INTERNATIONAL BOMBING.\n>> WE THANK THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE BOMB SQUAD.\nTHINK ABOUT THIS, YOU SEE SOMETHING ON THE STREET, IT'S A\nBOMB. WHO COMES IN THAT VEST AND THE\nPROTECTIVE HELMET IN ORDER TO TRY TO NOT HAVE IT DETONATE ON\nTHE STREET OF NEW YORK, BUT TO TAKE IT APART.\nIT'S THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE BOMB SQUADS ACROSS THE\nCOUNTRY, WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE TO TRY AND PROTECT US\nFROM THIS AS WE HAVE SEEN TONIGHT.\nRECAPPING TONIGHT IN OUR COVERAGE, AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE\nOBVIOUSLY, REPORTS SAY A PRESSURE COOKER HAS BEEN FOUND\nWITH WIRES AND A CELL PHONE ATTACHED, INDICATING THAT A\nTERRORIST OR TERRORISTS ARE NOW TARGETING US TO KILL US BY\nPUTTING BOMBS ON THE STREETS OF OUR CITIES.\nHERE'S NEW YORK CITY MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO EARLIER THIS EVENING.\n>> THERE'S BEEN A VERY SERIOUS INCIDENT.\nALL ELEMENTS OF OUR FIRST RESPONDERS HAVE BEEN A PART OF\nTHE OPERATION HERE. THIS WAS AN INTENTIONAL ACT.\nALL HANDS ARE ON DECK, INJURIES ARE SIGNIFICANT.\nTHERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF TERRORISM, NO THREAT AGAINST NEW\nYORK CITY AT ANY POINT IN TIME FROM ANY TERROR ORGANIZATION.\nA SECOND SITE AS WE SPEAK, IS BEING TREATED BY NYPD.\n>> WELL REPORTS NOW SAY AS YOU'VE BEEN REPORTING, THAT\nSECOND SITE FOUND A PRESSURE COOKER, POTENTIAL BOMB WITH A\nCELL PHONE ATTACHED, A CONTROLLED EXPLOSION, POSSIBLY\nTAKING THAT OUT. AGAIN, POTENTIALLY TWO EXPLOSIVE\nDEVICES, ON THE STREETS OF NEW YORK, ON A SATURDAY NIGHT,\nBRINGING BACK THE BOMBINGS OF THE FLAN, THE BOMBING IN '85\nTHAT KILLED 18 PEOP. THAT KILLED THIS WAY OF LIFE\nUSHERING IN A NEW ERA OF TERRORISM.\nTHANK YOU FOR JOINING US.",

              "text": "OF OUR STORY.\n>>> RICK GAGNON WAS IN A WORLD OF PAIN.\nLOCKED UP IN THE COUNTY JAIL FACING TWO MURDER CHARGES.\nHE SHARED HIS WOES WITH ANOTHER GUY IN A JUMPSUIT.\nTWO INMATES POWER WALKING TOGETHER AROUND THE YARD.\n>> WE WOULD WALK AROUND THE POD, DO LAPS.\n>> Reporter: THE JAIL YARD BUDDY WAS NAMED ROBERT MULLINS, A\nPETTY CROOK WHO SEEMED STRANGELY INTERESTED IN RICK'S TROUBLES.\nDID HE WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE CASE?\nWAS HE GRILLING YOU? >> YEAH, ALL THE TIME.\nALL THE TIME. >> Reporter: BUT THEN IT SEEMED\nEVERYONE IN THIS PART OF SOUTH CAROLINA WANTED TO KNOW MORE\nABOUT THE CASE AND ITS TWO BELOVED VICTIMS.\nIT TOOK THREE YEARS, BUT IN 2008 THE STATE WAS READY TO TRY\nRICK GAGNON FOR THE MURDERS OF CHARLIE AND DIANE PARKER.\nA CAMERA WAS ROLLING AS PROSECUTOR FRAN HUMPHRIES BEGAN\nHIS CASE. >> SO THIS IS PURELY MOTIVE\nEVIDENCE WHICH ESTABLISHES A MOTIVE FOR RICHARD GAGNON TO END\nTHE LIVES OF THESE TWO PEOPLE. >> Reporter: AS HUMPHRIES\nRECALLS, THE CASE AGAINST RICK WAS ALWAYS MOTIVATION STRONG,\nEVIDENCE WEAK. NOT MUCH MORE THAN A DROP OF\nCHARLIE PARKER'S BLOOD ON A SHOE WHEN YOU CAME RIGHT DOWN TO IT.\nEVEN SO, HUMPHRIES TOLD THE COURT THE BLOOD PUT RICK AT THE\nMURDER SCENE. BUT HE HAD A STORY FOR IT,\nDIDN'T HE? >> HE DID.\nIT DIDN'T HOLD WATER. BUT HE HAD A STORY ABOUT IT.\n>> Reporter: HUMPHRIES RECITED RICK'S VERSION OF HOW BLOOD GOT\nON HIS SHOE. HOW HE'D GONE INTO THE PARKER\nHOUSE TO GET A SET OF CAR KEYS SOME TIME AFTER CRIME SCENE\nTECHS HAD FINISHED UP. >> HE LOOKED TO HIS RIGHT, WHICH\nWAS THE WINDOW LEADING IN TO THE BATHROOM WHERE BIG CHARLIE HAD\nDIED AND NOTICED THE BLOOD. >> Reporter: RICK SAID HE\nWORRIED BAMBI, PACING OUTSIDE, MIGHT LOOK IN THE WINDOW AND\nFREAK OUT ALL OVER AGAIN. >> HE WENT IN AND STEPPED\nTHROUGH THE BATHROOM AND CLOSED THE BLIND.\n>> Reporter: AND WHOOPS, I STEPPED IN THE BLOOD.\nTHAT'S HIS STORY THOUGH, RIGHT? >> YEAH.\n>> Reporter: BUT IT DIDN'T HOLD UP?\n>> NO, BECAUSE THEY WERE ALREADY CLOSED.\n>> Reporter: THAT WAS THE GOTCHA.\nTHIS CRIME SCENE PHOTO, SAID THE PROSECUTOR, WAS TAKEN HOURS\nBEFORE RICK SUPPOSEDLY STEPPED INSIDE THAT HOUSE.\nNOTICE THE BATHROOM BLINDS ARE DRAWN.\nHUMPHRIES ARGUED THAT RICK COULD NOT HAVE CLOSED THE BLINDS\nBECAUSE THEY WERE ALREADY SHUT. THE PROSECUTOR SAID THE\nDEFENDANT WAS LYING, THOUGH HE BELIEVED RICK HAD TOLD THE TRUTH\nABOUT THE MURDERS TO AT LEAST ONE OTHER PERSON.\nTHE STATE'S STAR WITNESS, ROBERT MULLINS.\nTHE WITNESS I CALL THE JAILHOUSE SNITCH AND YOU PROBABLY CALL THE\nJAILHOUSE INFORMANT. >> OH, HE'S A SNITCH.\nNO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. AT THE END OF THE DAY, WHAT WE\nLEARNED FROM ROBERT MULLINS IS THAT HE'S BEEN GIVEN A FAIRLY\nDETAILED ACCOUNT BY GAGNON OF WHAT OCCURRED THAT EVENING AND\nWHAT THE CRIME SCENE LOOKED LIKE.\n>> Reporter: IN FACT, HE SAID, MULLINS WAS THE FIRST TO TELL\nPOLICE THIS PIECE OF BOMBSHELL NEWS.\nGAGNON HAD MENTIONED AN ACCOMPLICE IN THE KILLINGS.\n>> THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN HAVE THAT INFORMATION IS FROM SOMEONE\nWHO WAS ON THE CRIME SCENE AND PARTICIPATED IN THE CRIME.\n>> Reporter: AND THEN THE PROSECUTOR TRIED TSPO IN AN\nINCONVENIENT FACT IN HIS FAVOR. THOSE MYSTERY BLOOD DROPS FOUND\nAT THE MURDER SCENE HAD BEEN TESTED.\nTHE DNA WAS NOT A MATCH TO RICK BUT TO AN UNIDENTIFIED MALE.\nTHAT, SAID THE PROSECUTOR, ACTUALLY SUPPORTED WHAT MULLINS\nSAID -- THAT RICK HAD AN ACCOMPLICE.\nHUMPHRIES BELIEVED THE EVIDENCE WAS ENOUGH TO PUT THE DEFENDANT\nAWAY. HE ONLY WISHED HE COULD MAKE THE\nSAME CASE AGAINST RICK'S OLD GIRLFRIEND.\nWHAT ABOUT BAMBI? I MEAN, SHE WASN'T BEING TRIED\nIN THIS COURTROOM. >> NO.\nI THINK IT'S A TRAVESTY. >> Reporter: HER FINGERPRINTS\nARE ON THIS? >> ALL OVER IT.\nFIGURATIVELY. >> Reporter: AND THAT'S JUST HOW\nHE LAID IT OUT IN HIS CLOSING. HE TOLD THE JURY THIS WAS A\nSTORY ABOUT A SPOILED WOMAN, BAMBI BENNETT, WHO'D MANIPULATED\nHER BOYFRIEND RICK GAGNON INTO DOING HER MURDEROUS DIRTY WORK.\nGET BACK THE DEED, GET HER MOTHER OFF HER BACK.\n>> HE HAD HEARD FROM BAMBI HOW, YOU KNOW, HER PARENTS WERE NOT\nFAIR TO HER. THAT THEY HAVE HER LAND.\nYOU KNOW, MY PARENTS ARE HORRIBLE PEOPLE AND THEY'VE\nTAKEN ADVANTAGE OF ME. >> Reporter: TO MAKE THINGS\nRIGHT, ARGUED THE PROSECUTOR, THE DUTIFUL BOYFRIEND AND HIS\nRIGHT-HAND MAN ENTERED THE HOUSE AND HUNTED DOWN BAMBI'S PARENTS\nIN THEIR NIGHT CLOTHES. THE JURY HAD JUST HEARD A DRAMA\nOF SOUTHERN GOTHIC PROPORTIONS, DRIPPING WITH FAMILY GREED AND\nHATRED. NOW IT WAS TIME FOR AN ENTIRELY\nDIFFERENT STORY. >> NONE OF THE PUZZLE PIECES\nFIT. >> Reporter: RICK'S DEFENSE\nTEAM, INCLUDING ATTORNEY BARBARA PRATT, TOLD THE COURT THAT THE\nSTATE'S CASE WAS HEAVY ON FICTION, LIGHT ON FACTS.\nTHEY HAD A PUZZLE, THEY HAD NEAT LITTLE PIECES, BUT THE PIECES\nWEREN'T EXACTLY RIGHT. >> Reporter: THE STATE WAS SO\nDESPERATE TO PROVE ITS CASE, SHE SAID, IT CLUNG TO THE WORD OF A\nJAILHOUSE SNITCH AND CAREER CRIMINAL.\n>> A FELLOW THAT IS THERE TO CUT HIMSELF A DEAL AND GET HIMSELF\nSOME ASSISTANCE, I GUESS, IN HIS OWN CASE, IS NOT LIKELY TO BE\nCREDIBLE. >> Reporter: NOT ONLY WAS THE\nSNITCH NOT TO BE BELIEVED, THE DEFENSE TOLD THE JURORS, BUT THE\nSTATE WAS ALSO TRYING TO CONFUSE THEM ABOUT THE MYSTERY BLOOD\nFOUND AT THE CRIME SCENE. THE BOTTOM LINE, SAID PRATT, THE\nDNA FROM THAT BLOOD CLEARED THEIR CLIENT OF THE MURDERS.\n>> THE DNA DIDN'T MATCH, AND WE KNEW THE DNA WAS NOT GOING TO\nMATCH RICK. >> Reporter: AND THEY KNEW THAT,\nSHE SAID, BECAUSE RICK HAD AN ALIBI FOR THE NIGHT OF THE\nMURDERS -- HE'D BEEN ASLEEP IN MYRTLE BEACH WITH BAMBI.\nTHE WAY PRATT SAW IT, THE MOST CHALLENGING PART OF THE CASE WAS\nTHE BLOOD ON RICK'S SHOE. TO EXPLAIN HOW IT GOT THERE,\nRICK TOOK THE STAND. HE POINTED OUT THAT ON THE\nMORNING THE BODIES WERE DISCOVERED POLICE HAD EXAMINED\nHIM THOROUGHLY AND FOUND NOTHING.\n>> IF THERE WAS BLOOD ON MY SHOES THAT MORNING, I'D HAVE\nBEEN ARRESTED RIGHT THEN AND THERE.\nTHERE WAS NO BLOOD ON MY SHOES THAT MORNING.\n>> Reporter: THAT CAME LATER, HE SAID, WHEN HE STEPPED INTO THE\nBLOOD-SOAKED BATHROOM. DESPITE THAT POLICE PHOTO, HE\nINSISTED THE WINDOW BLINDS WERE OPEN.\nAND HE'D WORRIED SIMPLY THAT BAMBI MIGHT SEE THE HORROR\nINSIDE. >> I WENT IN AND SHUT THE BLIND.\nI DIDN'T THINK SHE NEEDED TO SEE THAT.\n>> Reporter: HE TESTIFIED THE BLOOD GOT ON HIS SHOE AT THAT\nMOMENT, NOT BEFORE. DID YOU GO INTO THE HOUSE AND\nKILL BIG CHARLIE AND DIANE AT THE INSTIGATION OF BAMBI?\n>> ABSOLUTELY NOT. >> Reporter: WERE YOU TWO IN A\nCONSPIRACY TO KILL THOSE PEOPLE? >> NO, SIR.\n>> Reporter: SO WHO DID KILL THE COUPLE?\nWE DON'T KNOW, SAID THE DEFENSE, BUT IT WASN'T RICK GAGNON.\nWITH THAT, THE JURORS FILED OUT TO DELIBERATE.\nRICK WAITED WITH HIS ATTORNEYS. AND THE WOMAN MANY FELT TO BE AT\nTHE HEART OF IT ALL HELD HER",

THERE NEEDS TO BE A SOLUTION TO\nTHIS. >> IVANKA TRUNK IS LEADING THE\nCHARGE FOR HER FATHER'S NEW PLAN AND TAKING HEAT.\nWHEN \"COSMOPOLITAN\" MAGAZINE BROUGHT UP THIS 2000 QUOTE ABOUT\nPREGNANCY. >> IT IS AN INCONVENIENCE FOR A\nPERSON RUNNING A BUSINESS. >> I THINK THAT YOU HAVE A LOT\nOF NEGATIVITY IN THESE QUESTIONS.\nI DON'T KNOW HOW USEFUL IT IS TO SPEND TOO MUCH TIME WITH YOU.\nBEFORE ENDING IT, SHE CALLED IT AN UNFAIR CHARACTERIZATION OF\nHIS TRACK RECORD AND HIS SUPPORT OF PROFESSIONAL WOMEN.\nTHE TRUMP TEAM STARTS INSISTING HIS COMPANY GIVES EIGHT WEEKS OF\nPAID LEAVE TO NEW PARENTS.

CLINTON WANTS TO GIVE NEW\nPARENTS, 12 WEEKS OF PAID FAMILY/MEDICAL LEAVE.\nTRUMP SAYS PAID MATERNITY LEAVE SHOULD BE 6 WEEKS.\nCLINTON WANTS NO MORE THAN 10% OF THEIR INCOME TO GO FOR CHILD\nCARE.

THE UNITED STATES IS THE ONLY\nDEVELOPED ECONOMY THAT DOES NOT GUARANTEE ANY PAID PARENTAL\nLEAVE. THIS ELECTION SEASON, THINGS ARE\nCHANGING. BOTH DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY\nCLINTON ARE PUSHING FOR GOVERNMENT FUNDED PLANS FOR\nPARENTAL LEAVE. NEVER BEFORE HAVE PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATES FROM THE DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN PARTY OFFERED\nTHESE PROPOSALS FOR NEW PARENTS. THE FIRST TIME A REPUBLICAN\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN THE GENERAL ELECTION HAS DONE SO.\nLET'S TALK ABOUT ALL OF IT WITH MY PANEL, CHRISTINA LESHI.\nKATY AND CHRISTINA. HOW BIG IS IT THAT BOTH\nCANDIDATES ARE BACKING GOVERNMENT FUNDED PAID LEAVE?\n>> IT IS INCREDIBLE. IT IS THE FIRST TIME AS YOU\nSAID. IT IS ALSO ELEVATING THE ISSUE\nTHAT AFFECTS A LOT OF AMERICAN FAMILIES.\nTHIS ISN'T JUST A KITCHEN TABLE ISSUE.\nIT IS WEIGHING ON OUR BIRTH RATE AS A COUNTRY.\nTHAT HAS RIPPLE EFFECTS THROUGHOUT OUR ECONOMY.\nTHIS IS A BIG ISSUE AND TURNING POINT.\nTHE QUESTION FOR TRUMP, DOES IT HELP HIM WITH WOMEN AND\nFAMILIES. WOMEN AND FAMILIES HAVE TO\nCOMPARE HIS PLAN TO HILLARY CLINTON'S PLAN.\nON THE FACE, WHEN YOU LOOB AT HILLARY CLINTON'S PLAN, IT HAS\nMORE TIME OFF, INCLUDES DADS AND INCLU\nINCLUDES UNIVERSAL PRE-K. UNCLEAR HOW MANY WOMEN THIS WILL\nBRING OVER TO HIS SIDE. IT RISKS ALIENATING THE\nESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS WHO ARE VERY NERVOUS ABOUT CREATING\nA NEW ENTITLEMENT. HE SAYS HE IS GOING TO PAY FOR\nIT BY RINGING OUT FRAUD. A LOT OF ECONOMISTS AND BUDGET\nEXPERTS SAY RINGING OUT FRAUD ISN'T A PLAN.\n>> THEY TRY ENDLESSLY TO DO IT. STAY WITH ME.\nCAYLEE, AS A TRUMP SUPPORTER, THIS IS A SIX-WEEK PLAN.\nIT DOESN'T INCLUDE FATHERS. >> I THINK YOU WOULD HAVE TO\nTAKE IT UP WITH THE CAMPAIGN. THIS IS A REVOLUTIONARY PLAN FOR\nA REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE. YOU HAVE FOR THE FIRST TIME MY\nPARTY SAYING THIS IS AN IMPORTANT I ISSUE.\n>> I WONDER IF YOU THINK IT SHOWED OR NEEDS TO INCLUDE\nFATHERS. NOT ONLY ARE DADS A HUGE PART OF\nTHE EQUATION SPECIALLY THESE DAYS BUT ALSO FOR SAME-SEX\nCOUPLES. >> HERE IS WHAT I LIKE ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP. THIS IS A NEGOTIATION.\nHE REALIZES FROM SOME OF THE DETAILS HE CAN CHANGE AND\nEVOLVE.

THIS IS NOT A WOMEN'S ISSUE BUT\nA FAMILY ISSUES. DONALD TRUMP'S CONVENTIONAL\nATTITUDES TOWARDS WOMEN, NOTWITHSTANDING.\nLEAVING FATHERS OUT ON THE TRUMP SIDE IS A PROBLEM.\nFOR WOMEN AND MEN ALIKE, THE POLICY IS IMPORTANT.\nHOW DOES THIS PERSON FEEL ABOUT ME?\nARE THEY REALLY GOING TO FIGHT FOR ME?\nI THINK THAT'S WHERE DONALD TRUMP'S PAST COMMENTS AND\nPOLICIES ARE A REAL PROBLEM. HE ONCE SAID THAT A BREAST\nFEEDING WOMAN WAS DISGUSTING. HE LIED ABOUT CHILD CARE.\nHE HAS NEVER PROVIDED CHILD CARE.\n>> THAT'S NOT EXACTLY THE CASE THAT TRUMP HAS NOT PROVIDED THAT\nFOR EMPLOYEES. I DO WANT TO DIG INTO WHAT YOU\nARE >> IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THE CASE.\nCNN IN FACT FACT-CHECKED IT. YOU KNOW IT'S NOT THE CASE.\nHANDBOOK CAME FROM ONE OF THE TRUMP INTERNATIONAL HOTELS AND\nIT'S ONLY GOVERNMENT-FUNDED UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS.\nDO THE PRACTICES ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION NOW NEED TO MEET\nTHE POLICY THAT HE'S PROPOSING? >> FACT IS A LOT OF THE TRUMP\nORGANIZATION DOES PROVIDE PAID LEAVE THAT'S IMPORTANT.\n>> BUT A LOT DOESN'T. NOT ALL.\n>> BUT A LOT DO.

THIS IS ASTERISK.\nTHESE CHANGE FOR CHILDCARE DO NOTHING FOR GROWTH.\nTHEY MAKE THE TAX CODE MORE COMPLICATED.\nALSO, THE SPECIAL ACCOUNTS WHERE YOU CAN PUT MONEY, FOR CHILDREN\nOR ELDERLY PEOPLE TO TAKE CARE OF THEM.\nTHESE CREATIONS, MEDICAL SAVINGS ACCOUNTS, 5.9 FOR COLLEGE.\nYOU NEED THESE WHEN YOU HAVE HIGH TAX RATES.\nIF YOU BRING THE TAX RATES DOWN, YOU DON'T NEED ALL THESE LITTLE\nCARVE OUTS. IT IS AT ODDS WITH THE REST OF\nHIS MAN. >> HOW YOU PAY FOR THIS IS\nFASCINATING. TRUMP SAYS HE WILL DO IT THROUGH\nUNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. HILLARY'S IS IN THE FAMILY ACT\nINTRODUCED BY SENATOR HILL BRANDON.\nPAT TOOMEY IS RAMMING IT DOWN THEIR THREATS SAYING IT INCLUDES\nA NEW PAY ROLL TAX. >> SO TRUMP'S POLICIES ARE NOT\nAS BAD AS THAT BUT IT IS A NEW ENTITLEMENT.\n>> IT IS. NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.\nAND TOOMEY SHOWS YOU CAN RUN AGAINST THE FAMILY ACT IDEA.\nAND TRUMP IS MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO DO THAT.\n>> THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN FIGURED WE'RE NOT DOING WELL ENOUGH\nAMONG REPUBLICAN WOMEN, COLLEGE EDUCATED WOMEN.\nWE HAVE TO TRY SOFTEN OUR IMAGE AND THAT'S WHY THIS IS\nPOLITICALLY POTENT. >> IT IS NOT AS EFFECTIVE AS IT\nCOULD BE THEY ARE TRY IT WORRY ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR GROUP OF\nVOTERS BUT THERE ARE WAYS TO GET MESSAGE ACROSS THAT ARE FAR MORE\nCONSISTENT WITH CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES.\nTRUMP NEEDS TO TALK ABOUT THE 1%, THE 2% IS THE MAIN REASON\nWHY FAMILIES D ENOUGH DISPOSABLE INCOME ON TAKE CARE\nOF CHILDCARE EXPENSES. WE HEARD THAT CLIP WHERE HE\nTALKED ABOUT THAT WOMEN SUFFER UNDER OUTDATED LAWS.\nTHAT IS ABSOLUTELY THE TRUTH. WHAT HE SHOULD BE OUT THERE\nTALKING ABOUT IS INSTEAD OF PROPOSING GREATER BIGGER\nGOVERNMENT TALKING ABOUT GETTING RID OF THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE,\nOBAMACARE, ET CETERA, WHICH DISPROPORTIONATELY HURT MANY\nWOMEN AND ALSO TAKE AWAY THEIR ABILITY TO PAY FOR CHILDCARE.\n>> YOU DON'T SEE HIM LAYING OUT A MAN FOR WHAT HE WOULD DO TO\nREPLACE OBAMACARE WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD UNITE\nREPUBLICANS AND PROBABLY AFFECT A LOT MORE AMERICANS THAN THIS\nPARTICULAR CHILDCARE PROPOSAL WOULD.\n>> I CAN ONLY ASSUME IT WAS NOT ONE OF IVANKA'S PRIORITIES.\nHE'S BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT THIS WAS A DRIVING FORCE IN HAGUE OUT\nA CHILDCARE PLAN. AND OBAMACARE IS MORE\nCOMPLICATED. IT REQUIRES A MORE SOPHISTICATED\nANALYSIS AND REPUBLICANS ARE NOT PARTICULARLY IN AGREEMENT ON HOW\nTO DEAL WITH IT. >> THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS HAVE\nCOME OUT WITH A MAN.",

IT'S A HUGE ISSUE IN THIS\nPRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. >> WE'RE GOING TO END FAMILY\nDETENTION, CLOSE PRIVATE DETENTION FACILITIES, AND\nSTOP THE RAIDS AND ROUND-UPS.\nNO CHILD SHOULD HAVE TO SAY GOODBYE TO THEIR PARENTS\nEVERY MORNING NOT KNOWING IF THEIR MOM OR DAD WILL BE\nTHERE WHEN THEY GET HOME. >> SECRETARY CLINTON PUTTING\nFORTH THE VERY SYMPATHETIC YOU HAVE ON ILLEGAL\nIMMIGRATION. JOINING US FROM L.A. THE\nAFOREMENTIONED WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE.\nWHAT'S THE HEADLINE OF YOUR STORY, WILLIAM.\n>> TWO HEADLINES, NUMBER ONE, FOR YEARS WE HAVE\nGENERALLY BEEN TOLD THAT THE ADMINISTRATION EITHER\nCATCHES OR DETERS ABOUT 80% OF THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ON\nTHE SOUTHWEST BORDER. THE REPORT THAT I'M AWARE\nOF, THAT WE PAID FOR, SHOWS IT'S REALLY MORE LIKE 50/50.\n51%. SECONDLY, YOU PAY FOR IT,\nIT'S COMPLETED IN MAY. AND IT IS STILL NOT BEING\nRELEASED EVEN THOUGH PEOPLE WHO ARE INVOLVED WITH\nAUTHORIZING THAT REPORT WANT IT OUT.\n>> ALL RIGHT. HAVE YOU SEEN THE REPORT\nYOURSELF, WILLIAM? >> I HAVE BEEN EXTENSIVELY\nBRIEFED ON IT AND I HAVE SEEN PORTIONS OF MATERIAL\nFROM THE REPORT THAT ALLOWED US TO MAKE THESE\nCONCLUSIONS, THE 51% NUMBER. >> WHO DID THE REPORT?\nWHO DID IT? >> THE REPORT WAS DONE BY AN\nOUTSIDE FEDERAL QUASIFEDERAL AGENCY THAT IS HIRED BY\nHOMELAND SECURITY TO DO IT. EIGHT RESEARCHERS SPENT ONE\nYEAR, MADE THREE TRIPS TO THE BORDER.\nTHESE ARE THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST.\nALL PH.D.ES. CAME OUT WITH THE REPORT,\nPEER REVIEWED THE NUMBERS AND METHODOLOGY IS GOOD.\nIT SAYS THE NUMBER ISN'T 81%.\nIT'S 51%. THAT'S A NUMBER THEY ARE\nTRYING TO GET OUT. >> WHAT IS THE HOMELAND\nSECURITY CHIEF JEH JOHNSON SAY ABOUT THIS NUMBER ONE\nAND WHY IS HE HOLDING IT BACK NUMBER TWO?\n>> IRONICALLY JEH JOHNSON IS THE ONE WHO ORDERED THE\nREPORT. CONGRESS HAD BEEN ASKING FOR\nTHIS NUMBER FOR YEARS DATING BACK TO JANET NAPOLITANO.\nHE HAD THE COURAGE TO AUTHOR, COMMISSION THE\nREPORT, WANTED TO GET IT OUT.\nWHEN HE TRIED TO GET IT OUT, HE WAS TOLD HE HAD TO GO TO\nTHE WHITE HOUSE DOMESTIC POLICY COUNSEL CECIL MOON\nKNOWS. >> WHO TOLD HIM.\n>> THE PEOPLE AT DHS TOLD THE CONSULTANTS HIRED TO DO\nTHE REPORT YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE WHITE HOUSE BEFORE WE\nCAN LET THIS OUT. IT HAS TO BE COORDINATED\nWITH THE DOMESTIC POLICY COUNCIL.\n>> INVOLVED WITH KEEPING THIS THING DOWN.\nHE DIDN'T PUT IT OUT ON HIS OWN.\nHE SAID YOU HAVE GOT TO RUN IT BY THE WHITE HOUSE.\nOF COURSE, THE WHITE HOUSE DOESN'T WANT IT OUT THERE.\nTHAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE? >> THAT IS THE BOTTOM LINE.\nTHEY HAD A MEETING. 13 PEOPLE.\nTHEY YELLED AT EACH OTHER. THEY SAID WE WANT IT OUT.\nTHEY SAID NO WAY. POLITICAL REASONS YOU ARE\nNOT GOING OUT. >> ALL RIGHT.\nIT WILL GET OUT NOW THAT YOU REPORTED IT AND BY THE WAY\nTHAT IS AN EXCLUSIVE BY WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE.\nGOOD JOB. WE APPRECIATE YOU COMING ON\nTONIGHT. THE OTHER SECURITY STORY\nTHIS EVENING, HACKING INTO PRIVATE EMAILS.\nTHIS WEEK GENERAL COLIN POWELL, FORMER SECRETARY OF\nSTATE WAS EMBARRASSED WHEN HIS PERSONAL EMAIL SURFACED\nPUBLICLY, DISPARAGING BOTH HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD\nTRUMP. JOINING US NOW FROM\nWASHINGTON MORGAN WRIGHT, A CYBER SECURITY ANALYST.\nSO, WHO DO YOU THINK HACKED INTO POWELL'S EMAILS?\n>> ALL INDICATIONS POINT TO THE RUSSIANS.\nTHEY HAVE HAD AN ONGOING CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE DNC.\nTHE CIA DIRECTOR GOOSEIFER 2 POINT 0.\nTRADE CRAFT POINTS IT'S GOT TO BE SOMEBODY IN THERE.\n>> WHEN SOMEONE GETS HANGED BY LIKE GENERAL POWELL THE\nFBI IS THE AGENCY THAT GOES IN AND TRIES TO TRACK WHO IS\nDOING IT. >> YEAH, USUALLY THEY\nDOCUMENT THEY USUALLY HAVE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR\nTHINGS LIKE THAT. SOMETIMES THE SECRET SERVICE\nOR DHS WILL GET INVOLVED. ON SOMETHING LIKE, THIS YOU\nWILL MOST LIKELY SEE THE FBI TAKE THE LEAD.\n>> PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR THAT THE BUREAU HAS SEEN EACH\nHACK HACKER, CHINA AND RUSSIAN HACKERS.\n>> YES. >> YOU SAY YOU KNOW FOR A\nFACT THAT THE POWELL HACK HAS A PROFILE OF A RUSSIAN\nOPERATION. >> IT'S HARD TO PUT FACTS IN\nCYBERSPACE. IF RUSSIA LAUNCHES A MISSILE\nWE CAN PRETTY WELL TRACE THAT.  THAT'S DIRECT\nATTRIBUTION. HIKE WE SAW WITH NORTH KOREA\nIT TOOK A WHILE TO GET THE FACTS DOWN.\nLET'S PUT IT THIS WAY MORE FACTS TO INDICATE IT'S\nRUSSIA GEOPOLITICALLY, TRADE CRAFT TOOLS ALL THINGS ARE\nPOINTING. >> THESE WIKILEAKS PEOPLE\nAND COULD IT BE INDIVIDUALS DOING THIS?\nSOME GUY IN THEIR BASEMENT? IS THAT POSSIBLE?\n>> I DON'T THINK SO, BILL. I WILL TELL YOU WHY.\nTHERE IS A LEVEL OF SOPHISTICATION HERE.\nA LEVEL OF ROLLING THINGS OUT.\nAND UNDERSTANDING POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS OF DOING.\nTHIS SUSTAINED EFFORT IT TOOK OVER TIME TO COLLECT\nTHESE EMAILS. THESE THINGS WENT ON FOR A\nCOUPLE YEARS. THEY HAVE OVER TWO TO THREE\nYEARS OF EMAILS OF GENERAL POWELL AND OTHER PEOPLE.\n>> THAT'S HAVING INTERESTING.\n>> SUSTAINED INITIATIVE. >> POWELL GETS SEVERELY ELM\nEMBARRASSED AND ANYBODY IN POWER POSITION THAT USES THE\nMACHINES AS I CALL THEM HAS TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING\nHACKED. >> YES.\n>> IS THERE ANY WAY FOLKS CAN PROTECT THEMSELVES?\n>> YOU KNOW, BILL, IF PEOPLE WILL DO JUST THREE BASIC\nTHINGS, NUMBER ONE ENCRYPT EVERY PIECE OF DATA YOU HAVE\nAT RISK OR IN MOTION. NUMBER TWO, USE A BETTER\nPASSWORD AND STRONGER PASSWORD.\nTHINGS BUILT AROUND TO DO THAT.  THIRD CALLED\nMULTISTACK. YOURSER NAME AND PASSWORD OR\nUSER KEY THAT RECYCLES OVER 30 SECONDS.\nIF YOU DID THOSE THREE THINGS YOU WOULD BE BETTER\nTHAN 98% OF THE PEOPLE COMPUTING RIGHT NOW.\n>> TEXTING, THAT'S NOT THE SAME AS EMAIL.\n>> NO. >> YOU CAN HACK INTO\nTEXTING? >> YES, YOU CAN.\nTHERE IS A PROTOCOL CALLED SS 7.\nIT'S A GEEKY THING. THAT THING WAS HACKED.\nTHAT'S THE THICK THAT RUNS AUGUST THE CELL PHONES\nAROUND THE WORLD. GET TO EMAIL CELL PHONE,\nTEXT, APPLE AND iCLOUD AND STORING THINGS LIKE THAT,\nTHERE IS A LOT OF THINGS YOU CAN GET TO THAT PEOPLE DON'T\nREALIZE. >> YOU SEE, THERE IS NO\nPRIVACY IN THE WORLD ANYMORE.\nTHERE REALLY ISN'T ANY PRIVACY ANYMORE.\nTHIS ENCRYPTION I GUESS IS THE BEST THING.\n>> GO TO ALASKA SOMEWHERE AWAY FROM ALL THE CELL\nTOWERS, YOU MIGHT COME CLOSE.\n>> ALL RIGHT. MR. WRIGHT, WE APPRECIATE\nIT. THANKS VERY MUCH.\nBEACH BOYS ON DECK. THEY ARE, AS YOU KNOW,\nAMERICAN POP ICONS, BUT INTEREST IS A VERY DARK BACK\nSTORY TO THE GROUP. AND YOU WILL HEAR IT AS THE\nFACTOR CONTINUES ALL ACROSS THE U.S.A. AND ALL AROUND",

IS THERE ANY CHANCE THE MATH\nWORKS OUT SUCH THAT YOU END UP HAVING A DEMOCRATIC SENATOR\nTHERE WHICH WOULD MEAN HAVE HUGE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE BALANCE OF\nTHE SENATE? >> WELL, THE ONE THING YOU NEED\nTO REMEMBER ABOUT JOHN BELL EDWARDS IS THAT IT WAS A PERFECT\nSTORM FOR HIM. THERE WAS A LOT OF ANGST ABOUT\nGIVING VITTER THE KEYS, IF YOU WILL AND HE WAS A DIFFERENT KIND\nOF DEMOCRAT. THERE IS A PBIOSLISITY THIS TIME\nOU NDAR PARTICULARLY IF DAVID\nDUKE MAKES IT INTO THE RUNOFF, THAT IS A POSSIBILITY ON THE\nOUTSIDE AND I KNOW THE DEMOCRATS ARE STAYING UP LATE EVERY NIGHT\nPRAYING FOR JUST THAT KIND OF AN OUTCOME.\nALSO THERE'S A -- >> WE'VE SEEN THE REPUBLICAN\nDISAVOW DAVID DUKE PRETTY STRONGLY.\nIN FACT, IN WORDS THAT NO ONE EVER HEARD FROM THE RNC SO THAT\nWOULD MAKE THINGS QUITE COMPLICATED IF THAT HAPPENED.\nANY CHANCE OF THAT OF DAVID DUKE BECOMES ONE OF THE TWO IN THIS\nRUNOFF? THAT SEEMS LIKE IT'S OUTSIDE THE\nPROBABILITIES. >> IT IS OUTSIDE THE PROBABILITIES, BUT IT IS\nPOSSIBLE. HE HAS A CERTAIN SEGMENT OF THE\nVOTE THAT WILL VOTE FOR HIM. THEY WILL COME OUT AND VOTE FOR\nHIM WHERE AS THERE'S NOT ANY BIG EXCITING CANDIDATE AMONG THE\nOTHER 23, AND IT COULD -- IF IT'S A LOW TURNOUT ELECTION, HIS\nVOTE TURNS OUT, HE GETS INTO A RUNOFF WITH 10, 12, 14% OF THE\nVOTE WHICH IS POSSIBLE IN A LOW TURNOUT ELECTION.\nAND HE WILL BE MANY THE RUNOFF. THEN WE'LL BE HEARING A LOT FROM\nYOU GUYS. >> YEAH, BOY, WHAT DOES IT SAY\nTHAT THERE'S NOBODY EXCITING OUT OF 24 PEOPLE RUNNING FOR SENATE\nOTHER THAN A FORMER LEADER OF THE KU KLUX KLAN?\nI'M NOT -- THERE IS SOMETHING THAT SOCIOLOGISTS WILL SAY ABOUT\nTHAT SOMETIME. I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT IS, BUT ON\nTHAT POINT THOUGH, THIS ISN'T COMPLETELY WITHOUT DRAMA, SAVE\nDAVID DUKE. THERE'S THIS WHOLE ISSUE OF\nTHESE DEAD PROSTITUTES AND ONE CONGRESSMAN SAYING THAT HE HAS\nNOTHING TO DO WITH THE SCANDAL AND HE NEVER VISITED ANY OF\nTHESE DEAD PROSTITUTES, NOT THAT HE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THEIR\nDEATHS BUT HE NEVER FREQUENTED THEM.\nON THE OTHER HAND A STATEMENT SAYING WE HAVE NOTHING TO DO\nWITH THIS SCANDAL COMING OUT, BUT HERE'S ALL THE INFORMATION\nABOUT IT. >> YEAH.\nI LOVE THAT STATEMENT. IT WAS, OH, THIS IS TERRIBLE\nTHIS IS ALL COMING OUT. WE'RE GOING TO PRAY FOR THE\nFAMILY AND BY THE WAY, THIS IS A LINK TO THE BOOK IN ALL THESE\nARGUMENTS ABOUT IT. THIS IS A BOOK THAT WAS\nPUBLISHED ON TUESDAY. AND BASICALLY, YOU KNOW THE\nSTANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE ON THESE THINGS.\nTHE POLITICIAN SHUTS UP, WAITS FOR THE EVIDENCE TO COME OUT\nBECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SAYING I NEVER SAW THAT WOMAN\nAND THEN A PHOTOGRAPH SHOWS UP AND YET THE EVIDENCE TURNS OUT\nTO BE THERE THEY APOLOGIZE AND SEEK TREATMENT.\nTHIS IS DIFFERENT. WE WERE LOOKING INTO THIS BEFORE\nTHE BOOK WAS PUBLISHED AND FROM THE VERY BEGINNING THE\nCONGRESSMAN FROM LAFAYETTE WAS SAYING THIS IS WRONG, THESE ARE\nLIES, I DON'T KNOW ANY OF THESE PEOPLE AND THEN HIS WIFE CAME\nOUT WITH THE E-MAIL AND THEN WE FOUND THAT THE -- THAT KENNEDY\nCAMPAIGN WAS SENDING OUT TEXTS THAT BASICALLY SAID YOU KNOW,\nBOY, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT, HERE'S THE LINK.\n>> ONE STATEMENT FROM KENNEDY WHICH SEEMS LIKE HE KNOWS A LOT\nABOUT IT, I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR.\nKENNEDY, THIS IS ONE OF THE GUYS RUNNING FOR THE SENATE SEAT AND\nI THINK ACTUALLY ONE OF THE -- NOT THE LEADER IN THE POLLS.\nCORRECT? >> YES.\nYES, HE IS ONE OF THE LEADERS. >> I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT\nMY CAMPAIGN PLAYED ABSOLUTELY NO ROLE IN CREATING THIS STORY\nALLEGEDLY HIS SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH PROSTITUTES\nTHAT WERE LATER MURDERED. IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE HE'S\nGIVING THE CONGRESSMAN THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT IN THAT.\n>> AND I TALKED TO HIM ABOUT CONGRESSMAN BOUSTANY WAS\nBASICALLY SKURED FOR SPREADING THIS STORY AROUND.\nHE'S A RESPECTED JOURNALIST AND A PRESTIGIOUS PUBLISHER, AND\nIT'S A QUESTION THAT'S RAISED ABOUT CHARACTER, AND HE SAID I'M\nNOT GOING TO STOP TALKING ABOUT IT AND I'M NOT GOING TO, YOU\nKNOW, BE ASHAMED OF BRINGING THIS UP.\nEVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT IT. THAT MUCH IS TRUE.\nEVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT IT AND HE SAID I'M NOT GOING TO BE\nASHAMED ABOUT BRINGING IT UP. I GUESS THAT'S LEFT FOR THE\nVOTERS. >> THERE'S SOME HISTORY DOWN IN\nLOUISIANA TO THESE KINDS OF THINGS.\nYOU GO BACK TO EDWARDS WHO ONCE SAID THE ONLY WAY I CAN LOSE\nTHIS ELECTION IS IF I'M CAUGHT IN BED WITH EITHER A DEAD GIRL\nOR A LIVE BOY. IS THERE AN IDEA THAT SIMPLY\nKIND OF THE SUSPICIONS AND THE ILLUSIONS IN THIS BOOK THAT\nPOSSIBLY THIS CONGRESSMAN HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH ONE OF\nTHESE PROSTITUTES IS ENOUGH TO KNOCK HIM OUT ESPECIALLY IN A\nPLACE WHERE THERE IS A VALUE VOTERS SEGMENT OF LOUISIANA\nALTHOUGH ONE COULD QUESTION GIVEN THE CURRENT SITUATION HOW\nBIG THAT SEGMENT IS OR IF THEY HAVE SOMEBODY TO VOTE FOR.\n>> WELL, WE'VE BEEN VERY FORGIVING FOR THESE KIND OF\nTHINGS IN THE PAST, THAT QUOTE FROM ED WIN EDWARDS IS A GOOD\nEXAMPLE BUT WE ALSO HAD BOB LIVINGSTON, BUT HE CHOSE ON HIS\nOWN TO LEAVE. WE'VE BEEN FORGIVING FOR THOSE\nTHINGS IN THE PAST. >> AND FORGIVING OF VITTER\nHIMSELF. >> EXCEPT HE NEVER REALLY\nADDRESSED THE ISSUE. IT BECAME AN ISSUE DURING THE\nCAMPAIGN LAST FALL. HE NEVER REALLY ADDRESSED IT\nUNTIL THE VERY END. AND REALLY WHAT BROUGHT HIM DOWN\nWAS JEFFERSON PARISH REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT SAW A CHANCE TO\nPOUNCE AND THEY DID AND -- BUT IT'S BECAUSE HE NEVER REALLY\nADDRESSED THE ISSUE. BOUSTANY ON THE OTHER HAND HAS\nADDRESSED IT FROM THE GET-GO. >> WE'LL SEE IF THE LOUISIANA\nVOTERS ARE ARE FORGIVING AS THEY HAVE FOR SO MANY OTHERS.\nTHERE'S PROBABLY ANOTHER BOOK TO WRITE ON THIS.\nTHANKS FOR COMING WITH YOUR EXPERTISE.\n>> THANKS FOR ASKING ME TO COME. >> ALL THE BEST.\nLIZ? >> ALL RIGHT.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA ADDRESSES THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY\nNEXT WEEK. LOOMING OVER THE MEETING IS\nNORTH KOREA'S GROWING NUCLEAR PROGRAM.\nA PREVIEW OF THE PRESIDENT AND HOW HE DEFEND HIS FOREIGN\nPOLICY. >> LIZ, GOOD AFTERNOON.\nTHIS IS A REPORT CARD MOMENT FOR THE PRESIDENT.\nYOU'LL REMEMBER THERE WERE A LOT OF HIGH HOPES AND EXPECTATIONS\nSEVEN YEARS AGO WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA FIRST ADDRESSED THE U.N.\nHE TALKED ABOUT ENDING THE WARS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN,\nFIGHTING CLIMATE CHANGE AND CURVING THE PROLIFERATION OF\nNUCLEAR WEAPONS. FAST FORWARD TO TODAY, VARYING\nDEGREES OF SUCCESS IN SOME OF THOSE AREAS AND VERY LITTLE\nPROGRESS IN SOME OTHERS. DESPITE THE PRESIDENT'S PROMISE\nTO END THE WARS AND BRING OUR SOLDIERS HOME THERE ARE STILL\nTHOUSANDS OF U.S. TROOPS ON THE GROUND FIGHTING THE ISLAMIC\nSTATE. BUT IN HIS FINAL ADDRESS OTHE\nU.N. BEFORE HE LEAVES OFFICE, WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS SAY THE\nPRESIDENT WILL ATTEMPT TO DEFINE HIS LEGACY AS ONE THAT MADE THE\nPLANET SAFER AND MORE PROSPEROUS WHILE STILL ACKNOWLEDGING THE\nMAJOR PROBLEMS THE WORLD CONTINUES TO FACE.\n>> ON THE ONE HAND THERE ARE NUMEROUS POSITIVE INDICATORS IN\nTHE WORLD TODAY IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH, THE ABILITY OF\nCOOPERATION ON DIFFICULT ISSUES LIKE LIE CHAT CHANGE AND THERE'S\nALSO A GREAT UNEASE ABOUT A RANGE OF ISSUES.\n>> THAT STRATEGY HAS NOT WORKED WHEN IT COMES TO RUSSIA WHICH\nAMONG OTHER MOVES HAS UNABASHEDLY THREATENED UKRAINE.\nTHERE'S ALSO THE GROWING THREAT OF NORTH KOREA AS A NUCLEAR\nPOWER AFTER IT RECENTLY CONDUCTED ITS FIFTH NUCLEAR TEST\nAND CONTINUES TO OPENLY DEFIE INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA WILL ALSO INHERIT THE ONGOING REFUGEE\nCRISIS. THE PRESIDENT IS HOPING TO\nADDRESS THAT ON TUESDAY WHERE THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES ARE\nEXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE NEW COMMITMENTS TO ACCEPT ADDITIONAL\nREFUGEES. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH.\n>> YOU GOT IT.",

IT'S AN EXTREMELY INTERESTING\nWALK THROUGH OF A VERY DANGEROUS SET OF NEIGHBORHOODS.\nTHEN HE SAYS, CLINTON, LOOK, YOU KNOW, THERE'S PROBLEM WITH HER.\nSHE SEEMS TO HAVE CHANGED HER MIND ON TPP AND SHOULD HAVE NOT.\nSHE'S NOT CLEAR ON A LOT OF THINGS SHE WISHES TO DO.\nBUT THEN HE TAKES CLEAR AIM AT DONALD TRUMP AND HE SAYS, THIS\nIS A PERSON WHO, IN HIS LANGUAGE, IS UNFIT TO BE\nCOMMANDER IN CHIEF, FOR THE REASONS THAT YOU WERE JUST\nCITING FROM HIS PIECE.

WHAT WE MAYAN IT IS PATE TO HEAR\nIS MORE ABOUT THE SUSPECT. THERE ARE SOME LOCAL MEDIA\nOUTLET'S INCLUDING THE \"PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER\" THAT\nHOURS AGO NAMED THIS SUSPECT.

SOME DETAILS HAVE SURFACED IN\nLOCAL MEDIA. WE ALSO DON'T HAVE THE NAMES OF\nTHE OFFICERS. LOCAL MEDIA DESCRIBED ONE OF THE\nOFFICERS AS A 19-YEAR VETERAN OF THE POLICE FORCE.\nTHAT IS THE FEMALE OFFICER. THIS JUST IN FROM OUR NATIONAL\nASSIGNMENT DESK. OUR CARMAN ASAN GETTING THIS\nINFORMATION FROM US. NICHOLAS GLEN, 25 YEARS OLD, A\nLOCAL RESIDENT OF WEST PHILADELPHIA.\nWE HAVE DONE OUR OWN DIGGING THAT HE WOULD BE NAMED\nOFFICIALLY. THIS IS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS A\nCRIMINAL HISTORY. BACK IN 2009, HE WAS LISTED AS\nBEING PART OF A GANG RAPE. HE HAD THIS NOTE ON HIM.\nTHIS HATRED TOWARD A PROBATION OFFICER.\nWE DON'T KNOW THAT.

I DO WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT MORE\nBREAKING NEWS THIS HOUR. A BOMB EXPLODING IN NEW JERSEY.\nTHIS IS A PLACE WHERE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THIS MORNING WERE\nSCHEDULED TO BE ON A CHARITY RUN.\nTHERE IS THE TRASH CAN. A SMALL BOMB WENT OFF.\nIT WAS UNEXPECTEDLY DELAYED. NO ONE WAS CLOSE BY.\nNO ONE WAS INJURED. AUTHORITIES HAVE NO DOUBT THAT\nWHOEVER SET THE BOMB KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING.\n>> WHAT THE INTENTIONS WERE OF THE INDIVIDUAL, WE DON'T KNOW AT\nTHIS POINT. WHETHER IT IS CRIMINAL OR\nTERRORISTIC, IT WAS OBVIOUS IT WAS MEANT TO AFFECT THE RUN.\nTHE FACT THAT IT WENT OFF AT 9:35.\n>> ON THE PHONE WITH ME, SHIMON PROKAPEZ, OUR CNN PRIME PRODUCE\nPRODUCE, SOMEONE INCREDIBLY WELL-VERSED\nWITH THAT. THIS WAS A MUCH SMALLER DEVICE.\nSOME OF IT DID NOT DETONATE. THERE WAS THE DELAYED START.\nNO ONE WAS NEARBY. WHAT ELSE CAN YOU TELL US?\n>> SO IT APPEARS, YES, OBVIOUSLY, MUCH SMALLER TYPE OF\nDEVICE. STAND BY.\nI WANT TO TAKE OUR VIEWERS BACK TO PHILADELPHIA.\nYOU ARE LISTEN TOG RICHARD ROSS JR.\n>> THIS INDIVIDUAL FIRED AT HER AT CLOSE RANGE 18 TIMES.\nTHAT'S 18 TIMES WITH A 9 MILLIMETER RUGER.\nMOST OF THOSE ROUNDS DID ENTER HER VEHICLE.\nSHE WAS STRUCK QUITE A FEW TIMES.\nFORTUNATELY, AT LEAST ONE OR TWO WERE LODGED IN HER BALLISTIC\nVEST. SHE TOOK SOME ROUNDS THROUGH THE\nARM. HE ACTUALLY STRUCK HER SERVICE\nWEAPON TWICE, AND PRETTY MUCH DISABLED IT.\nTHERE WERE ROUNDS OF HERS ON THE FLOOR OF THE VEHICLE.\nI DON'T EVEN KNOW IF SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RETURN FIRE IF\nSHE HAD TO, BECAUSE HE WAS ABLE TO DISABLE IT BY STRIKING IT.\nHE THEN GOES DOWN TO THAT BAR AND HE FIRES FIVE TIMES INTO THE\nBAR WHERE YOU KNOW THE SECURITY GUARD WAS STRUCK.\nIT WAS A FEMALE AT THAT LOCATION THAT WAS STRUCK IN THE LEG AS\nWELL. HE FIRES AN ADDITIONAL 14 TIMES\nIN THE VEHICLE THAT WE MENTIONED LAST NIGHT, THE WHITE VEHICLE,\nWHERE A MALE WAS SHOT IN THE CHEST AND A FEMALE\nUNFORTUNATELY, A 25-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WAS PRONOUNCED LAST NIGHT\nAT 1:56 A.M. IT IS A PARTICULARLY TRAGIC\nTHING. OUR HEARTS AND PRAYERS GO OUT TO\nHER FAMILY AS WELL AS ALL THE OTHER VICTIMS.\nI JUST LEFT THE HOSPITAL AND TALKED TO SERGEANT YOUNG.\nSHE IS IN GOOD SPIRITS GIVEN WHAT SHE HAS BEEN THROUGH.\nIT IS ACTUALLY AMAZING SHE WAS ACTUALLY SITTING UP.\nTHEY WERE CHANGING SOME OF HER BANDAGES.\nI ALSO VISITED SOME OF THE CIVILIAN WITNESSES, PARTICULARLY\nONE OF THE MEN THAT WAS IN THE CAR WITH THE UNFORTUNATE\nHOMICIDE VICTIM. OBVIOUSLY, OTHER THAN BEING IN\nSOME PAIN, HE IS COMING ALONG. WE EXPECT HIM TO SURVIVE.\nI ALSO VISITED WITH THE SECURITY GUARD AS WELL AND HE IS IN GOOD\nSPIRITS. SO THIS WAS A HORRIFIC NIGHT.\nPOLICE DID AN ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC JOB.\nTHE RESTRAINT THEY USED DURING THE FOOT PURSUIT DOWN SAMPSON\nSTREET IS NOTHING SHORT OF MIRACULOUS.\nTHIS GUY IS FIRING AT EVERYBODY ON THE STREET THAT HE SEES.\nTHERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT THEY PROBABLY ELECTED\nNOT TO DISCHARGE THEIR WEAPONS FOR FEAR OF HITTING INNOCENT\nCIVILIANS. I CANNOT SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THEIR\nRESTRAINT AND WHAT THEY DID, IN ADDITION TO WHICH, THIS\nINDIVIDUAL, DURING THE COURSE OF HIS SHOOTING TREE STRUCK A\nPOLICE CAR, THE TWO OFFICERS THAT WERE NOT HIT WITH GUNFIRE\nAND RESPONDING TO THE SCENE. YOU KNOW IN NTHAT ALLEY, ENGAGE\nWITH THE OFFICERS AND THEY EVENTUALLY FIRE UPON HIM AND\nKILL HIM. WE KNOW HE HAD AT LEAST THREE\nMAGAZINES AND IN ADDITION TO THAT, HE HAD A PLASTIC BAG WITH\nSOMEWHAT IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF 13-15 LIVE ROUNDS ALSO WITH HIM.\nIT WAS JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT'S SURREAL.\nYOU CAN'T GET YOUR BRAIN AROUND IT.\nSO MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE HARMED IN ONE INCIDENT.\nOBVIOUSLY, HE WAS HELL BENT ON HURTING A LOT OF PEOPLE.\nWE STILL AREN'T ABSOLUTELY CLEAR AS TO WHY.\nWE KNOW FROM THE LETTER WE ALLUDED TO LAST NIGHT, HE\nMENTIONED, AN ISSUE WITH A PROBATION OFFICER AND NOT\nPARTICULARLY FOND OF POLICE OFFICERS, A LOT OF TALKING ABOUT\nHIMSELF AND WHAT HE DOES AND DOESN'T DO AND ISSUES HE HAS\nABOUT A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS.\nTHE INCIDENT WAS ENTITLED DOOMED, REFERRING TO ANYBODY WHO\nWAS GOING TO BE IN HIS PATH LAST NIGHT.\nWE DO NOT KNOW WHY. WE HAVE NO INDICATIONS HE HAS\nTIES TO ANYONE OR HE HAS BEEN RADICALIZED OR ANYTHING LIKE\nTHAT. WE KNOW HE CARRIED OUT ONE OF\nTHE MOST VIOLENCE ACTIONS WE HAVE SEEN IN PHILADELPHIA IN A\nLONG TIME. IT IS PARTICULARLY FRUSTRATING\nFOR US. AS YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE SECOND\nPOLICE OFFICER THIS YEAR THAT HAS BEEN AMBUSHED AND EVEN IN\nTHAT DISTRICT, THE 18th DISTRICT.\nUZ WE ARE ABSOLUTELY ASTOUNDING THAT THEY BOTH SURVIVED, JESSE\nHARTMAN AND SYLVIA YOUNG HAD UPWARDS OF 35 ROUNDS FIRED AT\nTHEM AT CLOSE RANGE WHILE THEY WERE SEATED.\nSHE HAD TO DO MUCH LIKE HIM IN LEANING IN THAT PASSENGER SEAT\nTO ESCAPE MUCH OF THAT GUNFIRE. IT IS THE QUICK THINKING THAT\nHELPED TO SAVE HER LIFE. AGAIN, A BUNCH OF CARNAGE OUT\nTHERE. VERY, VERY SADDENED BY THE LOSS\nOF LIFE AND THIS YOUNG LADY. WE ARE NOT RELEASING HER NAME.\nI AM NOT 100% CONFIDENT THAT ALL OF HER FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE BEEN\nNOTIFIED. MANY OF YOU ALREADY HAVE HER\nNAME. IF YOU HAVEN'T RELEASED IT YET,\nPLEASE DON'T UNTIL WE CAN BE CERTAIN OF THAT.\nWE WILL CONTINUE. HE HAD A COUPLE OF ADDRESSES,\nWHICH MASS MADE IT A LITTLE BIT COMPLICATED FOR US.\nA FAMILY MEMBER WAS ABLE TO HELP US LOW CASE THE PLACE WE BELIEVE\nHE WAS STAYING AT MOST RECENTLY. THERE IS NOTHING IN THERE THAT\nSUGGEST THERE ARE TIES TO ANYTHING ELSE.\nWE FOUND MORE AMMUNITION INSIDE OF THAT LOCATION.\nOTHER THAN THE RANTING HE HAD IN THAT LETTER, WE DON'T KNOW\nWHAT THIS WAS MOTIVATED BY. WE MAY NEVER KNOW IN THIS CASE.\nWE ARE JUST HOPEFUL THAT EVERYONE ELSE SURVIVES THEIR\nWOUNDS AND THIS IS A HORRIFIC NIGHT.\nI AM NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THE PHYSICAL PART OF IT BUT THE\nPSYC PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECT OF IT TOO,\nPARTICULARLY WHEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SERGEANT AND\nTHE INDIVIDUAL IN THE CAR WITH THE FEMALE WHO DIED.\nABSOLUTELY A HORRIBLE THING TO GO THROUGH FOR ANYBODY.\nI CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT THAT MUST BE LIKE.\nCANNOT SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THE RESPONSE OF THE POLICE OFFICERS\nABSOLUTELY REMARKABLE. I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD OF\nTHEIR RESPONSE. I WILL TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS AT\nTHIS TIME. >> IT HAD AN OBLITERATED SERIAL\nNUMBER. WE HAVE TO FIGURE THAT OUT RIGHT\nNOW. WE HAVE TO TRACK IT DOWN.\nI CAN'T -- CERTAINLY CAN'T EXPLAIN IF THAT'S THE FIRST TIME\nHE HAS EVER USED A GUN. I DON'T KNOW.\nSINCE THE SERIAL NUMBER WAS OBLITERATED, WE ARE GOING TO\nHAVE TO WORK WITH ATF TO GET THAT RAISED AND FIND OUT\nINFORMATION ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR INFORMATION.\nI OBVIOUSLY CANNOT PROVIDE THAT TO YOU RIGHT NOW AS THE STATUS\nOF THE GUN. RUGER.\n>> UP YOU MENTIONED THIS SPECIAL DETAIL.\nDID IT HAVE TO TOO WITH THE SPIKE IN VIOLENCE?\n>> WE HAVE MOBILE DETAIL FORCES. WE DO A LOT OF HOT SPOT POLICING\nLIKE PEOPLE ACROSS THE NATION DO.\nIDENTIFYING CRIME SPIKES AND PUTTING OFFICERS WHERE THEY ARE\nNEEDED. THIS WAS A PARTICULAR PLACE WE\nWERE CONCERNED ABOUT. THE SERGEANT, ALONG WITH OTHER\nOFFICERS WERE DEPLOYED THERE. SHE IS FROM A PARTICULARLY BUSY\nDISTRICT HERSELF, ALREADY, AS YOU KNOW, THE 22nd DISTRICT.\n>> IS IT BECAUSE OF THAT INCIDENT THAT YOU SPIKED UP THE\nPRESENCE THERE. >> WAS IT BECAUSE OF THE HARTNET\nINCIDENT? >> NO, IT WASN'T BECAUSE OF\nJESSE HARTNETT. >> WHY YESTERDAY?\nWHAT ABOUT LAST NIGHT? ANYTHING STANDING OUT AT THIS\nPOINT? >> NO.\nHOPELY, IN CONVERSATIONS WITH FAMILY MEMBERS, HIS ASSOCIATES,\nSOMEONE WILL BE ABLE TO TELL US WHY.\nI'LL TELL YOU HONESTLY FROM WHAT I HAVE BEEN TOLD ABOUT THIS\nLETTER, IT IS RAMBLING. IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO\nCLEAN ANYTHING FROM THAT. IT IS MORE ABOUT HIMSELF THAN IT\nIS ABOUT WHO HE WANTED TO HARM. I AM NOT A PHYSICIAN.\nI AM NOT QUALIFIED TO SAY WHETHER SOMEONE WAS SUFFERING\nMENTAL ILLNESS. YOU WOULD HAVE NO DIFFICULTY\nPROVING THAT TO ME. CLEARLY, THERE ARE SOME ISSUE\nTHAT IS WERE GOING ON THERE. I AM NOT MAKING EXCUSES FOR\nANYBODY. TO VIOLENTLY FIRE UPON SO MANY\nDIFFERENT PEOPLE THAT HAVE NO ISSUE WITH YOU AND DIDN'T HAVE\nANY ENCOUNTERS, TO DO THIS LIKE THIS, IT WAS ABSOLUTELY\nHORRIFIC.

WHAT IS MEANINGFUL OR WHAT'S\nIMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO RECOGNIZE WHEN ASSAULTS ON\nPOLICE OFFICERS HAPPEN PLAS THE NIGHT CAP-YARD THAT MORE THAN\nANYONE.

THREE ARE CIVILIANS.\nAS FOR A MOTIVE, THE AUTHORITIES IN PHILADELPHIA HAVE NO IDEA\nWHAT THE MOTIVE WAS. HOWEVER, THEY SAY THERE WAS A\nLETTER WRITTEN BY THE GUNMAN ENTITLED DOOM.\nTHEY SAID HE WAS HELL BENTD ON HURTING A NUMBER OF PEOPLE.\nHE NAMED A SPECIFIC PROBATION OFFICER.\nRICHARD ROSS JR., THE PHILADELPHIA POLICE\nCOMMISSIONER, SAYING THIS GUNMAN CARRIED OUT ONE OF THE MOST\nVIOLENT ATTACKS WE HAVE SEEN IN PHILADELPHIA IN A LONG TIME.\nNICK VALENCIA FOLLOWING THIS WITH US.\nNICK, WE JUST HEARD THE NAME.

YOU THE POLICE XHEEF ANSWERING\nQUESTIONS. HE WAS A SUSPECT IN A GANG RAPE\nIN 2009. THE CHARGES WERE LATER DROPPED\nIN 2010.
