THAT IS IF IT WAS STAYING\nSTILL AND RAINING OVERHEAD IN\nONE LOCATION FOR AN HOUR STRAIGHT BUT GOES TO SHOW HOW\nMUCH MOISTURE IS BASICALLY\nPACKED INTO THESE STORM. THE FACT IS WE HAVE ALREADY\nSEEN TWO INCHES OF RAIN IN\nPARTS OF SOUTHWESTERN NEW HAMPSHIRE.\nAND THE WET PATTERN ALL DUE TO\nTHIS COLD FRONT THAT WILL BE MOVING INTO THIS VERY MOIST\nENVIRONMENT HERE AND\nTRIGGERING THESE DOWNPOURS THROUGHOUT THE DAY.\nLET'S TIME IT OUT WITH\nFUTURECAST.

THAT HELPS REITs.\nWE HAD HIGH DIVIDENDS TYPICALLY PAYING 4%.\nAND THIS TALK ABOUT THIS NEW CREATION OF THIS NEW SECTOR HAS\nALSO DRIVEN SOME INTEREST AS WELL HERE.\nBEST PERFORMERS IN THE REITs, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I KNOW YOU'LL\nFIND THIS AMAZING, BUT RETAIL REITs HAVE DONE VERY WELL\nBECAUSE THE BIGGEST AND THE BEST GUYS OUT THERE, YOUR EQUITY\nONES, YOUR KIMCOS, SIMON PROPERTIES, THEY HAVE ACCESS TO\nTHE VERY BEST REAL ESTATE AND VERY BEST RETAIL PEOPLE OUT\nTHERE. SO THE TOP END MALLS ARE AMONG\nTHE BEST PERFORMERS. IT'S THE LOWER END MALLS, THE\nSTRIP MALLS HAVING TROUBLE. YOU'LL SEE A LOT OF THEM GET\nBULLDOZED OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS, I PREDICT, OVERALL.\nNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ASKING WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU OWN THE\nFINANCIALS IN THE S&P 500 BECAUSE THE REITs ARE GONE OUT?\nAND THE ANSWER IS THAT YOU GET A DISTRIBUTION.\nTHAT'S WHY YOU HAVE THE XLF, THEY'RE GOING TO BE DISTRIBUTING\nPARTS OF THE XLF, WHICH WERE REITs, SPINNING IT OFF OF COURSE\nINTO A SEPARATE SECTOR FOR HOLDERS OF THE ETF.\nTHAT'S WHY YOU'LL SEE THESE GYRATIONS IN THE S&P FINANCIAL\nSECTOR THIS WEEK BECAUSE OF THE DISTRIBUTION THAT'S GOING ON.\nWHEN IT'S ALL OVER, REITs WILL BE 3% OF THE S&P, ABOUT THE SAME\nAS MATERIAL STOCKS, ABOUT THE SAME AS TELECOM STOCKS.\nTALK MORE ABOUT THAT LATER. I JUST WANT TO SHOW YOU GM\nTHOUGH WHICH IS UP NICELY. GM HAS NOT HAD A GOOD YEAR\nOBVIOUSLY. AUTOS DOWN ABOUT 6% ON THE YEAR.\nI THOUGHT IT WAS A BOLD CALL BY THE ANALYSTS AT MORGAN STANLEY\nHERE WITH THEIR NUMBERS BECAUSE BY AND LARGE MOST OF THE\nESTIMATES FOR SEPTEMBER HAVE BEEN COMING DOWN.\nAND IF YOU TAKE A LOOK HERE WHAT'S GOING ON, ONLY SEVEN\nANALYST HAVES A BUY ON THIS RIGHT NOW.\nTEN HAVE A HOLD. AND NONE HAVE A SELL.\nYOU KNOW IT'S 70%, 80% BUY FOR MOST OF THE ANALYSTS ON ALL THE\nSTOCKS, THIS IS A PRETTY PESSIMISTIC GROUP IN GM.\nTHAT'S WHY I LOVE THE GUY FOR MAKING A BOLD CALL.\nAS FOR THE FED, THIS IS A TOUGH ONE BECAUSE THE ODDS SAY 15%,\n20%, AND YET WHY IS THE ANXIETY LEVEL SO HIGH DOWN HERE THAT THE\nFED MIGHT IN FACT TRY TO DO SOMETHING?\nA LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL THE FED REALLY DOES AND THEY'RE GOING TO\nTRY TO SURPRISE PEOPLE. SO THERE'S THIS SORT OF\nPARALYSIS MODE GOING ON. NOBODY BELIEVES THE 15% CHANCE\nAND THEY THINK THEY COULD GET SURPRISED IN OFF SIDES ON THE\nMARKET HERE. BEST BET AVERAGE PERSON DOWN\nHERE THINKS NO HIKE, BUT A LOT OF HAWKISH TALK AGAIN ABOUT\nDECEMBER, WHICH ALSO CREATES A LITTLE MORE ANXIETY.\nGUYS, I'VE NEVER SEEN IT SO ANXIOUS DOWN HERE ON A RATE HIKE\nTHAT NOBODY BELIEVES IS ACTUALLY GOING TO HAPPEN.\nIT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A STRANGE PSYCHOLOGICAL SITUATION TO BE\nIN. RIGHT NOW THE DOW UP 88 POINTS.\nBACK TO YOU. >> BOB, THANKS A LOT.\nBOB PISANI. MEANWHILE, WE ARE WATCHING OIL\nPRICES. JACKIE DEANGELIS AT THE NYMEX\nTHIS MORNING. HEY, JACKIE.\n>> GOOD MORNING TO YOU, CARL. THAT'S RIGHT, OIL PRICES TRADING\nHIGHER THIS MORNING, BUT STILL WELL UNDER THAT $45 A BARREL\nMARK. NOW, SOME MIXED MESSAGES FROM\nOPEC OVER THE WEEKEND. THE SECRETARY GENRE MINDING\nEVERYBODY THAT THE ALGERIA MEETING IS INFORMAL.\nSO THE LOGICAL INFERENCE THERE IS NO DECISION IS REALLY\nEXPECTED. MEANTIME YOU HAVE THE\nVENEZUELANS OUT SAYING A DEAL COULD BE VERY CLOSE.\nSO YOU SEE THIS FRAGMENTATION GOING ON WITHIN THE CARTEL.\nTHEN OF COURSE SOME CHATTER IN THE MARKETPLACE ABOUT AN\nEMERGENCY MEETING, MAYBE SOMETHING MORE FORMAL AFTER\nALGERIA, TO FINALIZE SOME SORT OF A PLAN.\nSO A LOT OF UNKNOWNS WHEN IT COMES TO OPEC.\nMEANTIME, I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT RBOB GASOLINE THIS MORNING, IT'S\nTRADING DOWN DESPITE THE FACT CRUDE IS COMING UP.\nWE HAVE AN UPDATE ON THE COLONIAL PIPELINE IINCIDENT.\nTHE COMPANY IS WORKING ON A BYPASS TO HELP DELIVER SUPPLIES\nTO SOME OF THE STATES IN THE SOUTHEAST THAT SUFFERED THIS\nWEEKEND. AND THEY SAW GAS PRICES SPIKE AT\nTHE PUMP. SO THIS IS SOMETHING TO WATCH,\nBUT THE EXPECTATION IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME\nRESOLUTION BY THE END OF THE WEEK AND THAT THIS WAS A\nTEMPORARY BLIP. BACK TO YOU, CARL.\n>> JACKIE, THANKS SO MUCH. WHEN WE COME BACK, THE LEGENDARY\nJIM BURROWS DIRECTED SHOWS LIKE \"CHEERS,\" \"FRIENDS,\" WILL &\nGRACE,\" WE'LL GET HIS TAKE ON THE EMMYS LAST NIGHT.\nAND ALSO JON FORTT IN SAN FRANCISCO WHERE HE'LL TALK WITH\nORACLE'S MARK HURD. GOOD MORNING, JON.\n>> GOOD MORNING, CARL. YEAH, LAST NIGHT LARRY ELLISON,\nORACLE'S EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN DECLARED AMAZON'S LEAD IS OVER.\nTHIS IS A CLOUD CONFERENCE NOW, BUT CAN THIS ENTERPRISE GIANT\nRUN FAST ENOUGH TO OVERTAKE THE NEW KIDS OF THE CLOUD?\nWE'LL TALK TO MARK HURD ABOUT THAT AND A LOT MORE IN THE NEXT\nHOUR. \"SQUAWK ON THE STREET\" WILL BE\nRIGHT BACK.   EVERYONE THOUGHT I WAS\n  CRAZY TO OPEN A HOTEL HERE.      EVERYONE SAID IT'S SO\n     HARD TO BE A MUSICIAN,",

YET IT JUST KEEPS HAPPENING.\nI'M TALKING ABOUT THE INCREDIBLE ENDLESS LINKAGE BETWEEN THE S&P\n500 AND OIL WITH CRUDE CALLING THE TUNE EVERY TIME IT RALLIES\nOR FALLS OFF, WHICH LITERALLY WAS THE CASE ALL DAY.\nWE STARTED THE SESSION STRONG WHEN OIL WAS ROARING BUT THEN\nTAPERED OFF WHEN OIL SURRENDERED SOME OF ITS GAIN.\nWITH OIL CLOSING NEAR THE LOWS OF THE DAY, SO DID THE AVERAGES.\nGIVEN THE BIG OIL GLUT, WE ALL KNOW ABOUT IT, HOW DID CRUDE\nMANAGE TO RALLY SO HUGE THIS MORNING?\nUP ALMOST $1 FROM THE GET-GO. SIMPLE.\nEVERY TIME OIL GOES DOWN TO THE LOW 40s, LIKE IT DID LAST WEEK\nAFTER A PERSISTENT HAMMERING, WE GET A RUMOR FROM OIL PRODUCERS\nTHAT A PRODUCTION FREEZE IS IMMINENT.\nSURE ENOUGH, THIS WEEKEND THE DESPERATE BUT VERY SHREWD OIL\nMINISTERS PLAYED THEIR PARTS TO THE HILT IN MANIPULATING OIL\nUPWARDS. HERE'S HOW IT WORKS IN THE FACE\nOF A MOUNTAIN OF OIL SWIRLING. FIRST TAKE A LOOK AT A ROIT\nSTORY THAT RAN UNDER THE HEADLINE, VENEZUELA SAID OPEC\nNON-OPEC OIL STABILIZING DEAL CLOSE.\nWITH A DATE LINE OF MARGARITA ISLAND, WHERE THERE WAS A SUMMIT\nOF THE NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT. THE STATEMENT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN\nMORE DEFINITIVE AND I QUOTE AGAIN.\nVENZ WAY LN PRESIDENT SAID ON SUNDAY THAT OPEC AND NON-OPEC\nCOUNTRIES WERE CLOSE TO REACHING A DEAL TO STABILIZE OIL MARKETS\nAND HE AIMED FOR A DEAL THIS MONTH.\nTHAT'S ALWAYS PART ONE OF THE RUMOR.\nA STATEMENT FROM THE MAN WHO NEEDS OIL TO GO HIGHER MORE THAN\nANY 0 LEADER IN THE WORLD, THE PRESIDENT OF VENEZUELA, WHOSE\nCOUNTRY IS FALLING APART BEFORE OUR VERY EYES.\nNEXT WE NEED A CALL TO ACTION FROM SOMEONE ELSE BESIDES THE\nTOTALLY LACKING CREDIBILITY VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT.\nSURE ENOUGH WHO WEIGHS IN RIGHT ON CUE?\nIN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH OF THE STORY, OPEC'S SECRETARY GENERAL,\nWHO GETS QUOTED AS SAYING, AND I QUOTE, OPEC MEMBERS MAY CALL AN\nEXTRAORDINARY MEETING TO DISCUSS OIL PRICES IF THEY REACH\nCONSENSUS AT AN INFORMAL GATHER IN ALGIERS THIS MONTH.\nWAIT A SECOND. THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.\nWE NEED ONE MORE THING. WE NEED ANOTHER PARTY THAT MIGHT\nBE ABLE TO TALK CUTBACK. SURE ENOUGH, GUESS WHO WAS AT\nTHE NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT SUMMIT AT MARGARITA ISLAND, WHICH BY\nTHIS TIME IS TURNING INTO MARGARITAVILLE FOR THE\nPRODUCERS, NONE ON THAT THE IRANIAN PRESIDENT, ANOTHER MAN\nWHO DESPERATELY NEEDS OIL TO GO HIGHER.\nROUHANI MADE IT CLEAR THAT TEHRAN SUPPORTS ANY MOVE TO\nSTABILIZE THE GLOBAL OIL MARKET AND LIFT PRICES.\nNOW, FINALLY WE NEED -- WHAT DO WE NEED?\nWE GOT THE GUY CALL, WE GOT A SECOND GUY.\nWE GOT A THIRD. WE NEED A VENUE.\nWE GOT THAT TOO. WITH A WELL-TIMED QUOTE AT THE\nEND OF THE ARTS CAL. OPEC MEMBERS WILL MEET ON THE\nSIDELINES OF THE INTERNATIONAL ENERGY FORUM WHICH GROUPS\nPRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS IN ALGERIA FROM SEPTEMBER 26th TO\nSEPTEMBER 28th. LET'S SEE.\nNOW WE'VE GOT VENEZUELA ON RECORD WANTING SOMETHING GOOD TO\nHAPPEN WITH OIL PRICES, SAME WITH IRAN.\nTHE FORMULA TO GET OIL UP NEEDS A BIG -- SURE ENOUGH, THIS STORY\nHAS EVERYTHING. NON-OPEC PRODUCER RUSSIA IS ALSO\nATTENDING THE FORUM, END QUOTE. VOILA.\nTHERE WE GO. OIL HEADS RIGHT BACK UP ON THE\nNEWS, RAMPING 90 CREPTS, TAKE THE DOW JONES AVERAGE RIGHT UP\nTRIPLE DIGITS AT THE OPENING. USUAL ALGORITHMS SAY IF YOU\nTHINK OIL IS GOING HIGHER, BUY STOCKS.\nMAYBE THE MARKET IS GETTING A LITTLE SMARTER.\nSTILL WE HAVE TO ASK HOW COME THIS KNEE JERK RALLYING KEEPS\nHAPPENING? THAT'S SIMPLE.\nTHE NATIONS INVOLVED, EVERYONE THAT I JUST MENTIONED ALL WANT\nOIL TO GO HIGHER BUT NOBODY WANTS TO CUT BACK PRODUCTION AND\nRISK LOSING MARKET SHARE TO THE U.S., WHICH IS READY TO TAKE\nADVANTAGE OF ANY PRODUCTION FREEZE THAT RAISES PRICE.\nSO THEY GO THROUGH THE CHARADE. THE OIL MARKET BUYS INTO IT AND\nTHEY GET THE JOB DONE. ONCE AGAIN, WITHOUT EVER REALLY\nHAVING TO CUT PRODUCTION, AND EVERYBODY SWALLOWS IT FROM THE\nJOURNALISTS TO THE STOCK TRADERS TO THE FUTURES TRADERS IN THE\nOIL PIT. ACCORDING TO MY COUNT, THIS IS\nTHE SIXTH TIME THIS GAME HAS PLAYED OUT ALREADY THIS YEAR.\nSIX! IT USUALLY WORKS LIKE A CHARM\nUNTIL WE RUN INTO AN UNMOVEABLE OBJECT LIKE WEDNESDAY'S ACTUAL\nPHYSICAL OIL INVENTORY NUMBER OR, GET THIS, THE REAL OPEC\nMEETING THAT COMES AND GOES WITH NO RESULTS WHATSOEVER, WHICH\nALWAYS SEEMS TO BE THE CASE ANYWAY.\nTHIS KIND OF RUMOR MONGERING STILL DOES EXACTLY WHAT THE\nWORLD'S OIL MINISTERS WANT. IT'S INCREDIBLE.\nIT'S RIDICULOUS, BUT IT WORKS EVERY TIME.\nSTICK WITH CRAMER.",

HILLARY CLINTON IS ACCUSING\nTRUMP OF SPEAKING RECKLESSLY AND MOLDING OUR ENEMY.\nALSO CALLING FOR VETTING FOR PEOPLE COMING INTO THIS COUNTRY\nWHICH SOME ANALYSTS ACCUSE OF TAKING A PAGE FROM TRUMP'S BOOK.\nTRU POLLS IN FLORIDA GIVE TRUMP A\nVERY SLIGHT EDGE WITH A MARGIN OF ERROR.\nSARA IS LIVE AT A TRUMP EVENT. SARA, TRUMP HAS HAD A LOT TO SAY\nTODAY AND YESTERDAY ABOUT THE BOMBINGS IN NEW JERSEY AND NEW\nYORK. IN TERMS OF THE NEED FOR AMERICA\nTO GET TOUGH, HAS HE PROVIDED ANY SPECIFICS ON GETTING TOUGHER\nON IMMIGRATION? >> Reporter: WELL, HE'S HAD A\nLOT TO SAY AND HE'S STILL GOING, JAKE.\nONE OF THE THEMES HE'S HITTING HARD TODAY IS HIS CALL FOR AN\nIDEALOGY TEST FOR ANY IMMIGRANTS COMING TO THE U.S., AND OF\nCOURSE HE'S USING THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BASH HILLARY\nCLINTON. HE'S ALREADY CALLED HER WEAK AND\nINEFFECTIVE TODAY AS THE TWO OF THEM SEEK TO ONE-UP EACH OTHER\nON THE QUESTION OF WHO IS BETTER PREPARED TO BE COMMANDER IN\nCHIEF. TODAY THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATES ARE FACING A TERROR RESPONSE TEST.\n>> THESE ATTACKS AND MANY OTHERS WERE MADE POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF\nOUR EXTREMELY OPEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM WHICH FAILS TO PROPERLY\nVET AND SCREEN THE INDIVIDUALS OR FAMILIES COMING INTO OUR\nCOUNTRY. >> WE MUST REMAIN VIGILANT.\nTHIS IS A FAST-MOVING SITUATION AND A SOBERING REMINDER THAT WE\nNEED STEADY LEADERSHIP IN A DANGEROUS WORLD.\n>> Reporter: DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON TAKING STARKLY\nDIFFERENT APPROACHES AND NAVIGATING A STRING OF ATTACKS\nIN THE U.S. TRUMP ONCE AGAIN CALLING FOR A\nMORE MUSCULAR STANCE. >> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO\nSOMETHING EXTREMELY TOUGH OVER THERE.\n>> LIKE WHAT? >> LIKE KNOCK THE HELL OUT OF\nHIM. >> BUT BEYOND A FEW SPECIFICS\nTHAT THE U.S. SHOULD BEGIN PROFILING.\n>> THEY'LL PROFILE. THEY SEE SOMEBODY THAT'S SU\nSUSP SUSPICIOUS, THEY WILL TAKE THAT\nPERSON. DO WE HAVE A CHOICE?\nDO WE REALLY HAVE A CHOICE? >> Reporter: MEANWHILE, HILLARY\nCLINTON IS LEANING ON THE SECRETARY OF STATE.\nCALLING FOR CHANGES TO THE VISA PROGRAM, IMPROVED INTELLIGENCE\nGATHERING AND COLLABORATION WITH THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY.\n>> IT IS CRUCIAL THAT WE CONTINUE TO BUILD UP TRUST\nBETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND MUSLIM AMERICAN COMMUNITIES.\n>> ALL WHILE SLAMMING HIS COMMENTS ON IMMIGRANTS.\n>> WE KNOW DONALD TRUMP'S COMMENTS HAVE BEEN USED ON LINE\nFOR RECRUITMENT OF IMMIGRANTS. >> IT'S JUST 50 DAYS BEFORE THE\nELECTION. BOTH ARE UNDER THE MICROSCOPE.\n51% OF VOTERS SAY TRUMP IS BETTER PREPARED TO FIGHT\nTERRORISM, COMPARED TO 45% FOR CLINTON.\nBUT THEY BELIEVE CLINTON'S TEMPERAMENT IS BETTER SUITED FOR\nTHE PRESIDENCY. AND 50% SAY SHE'S MORE PREPARED\nTO BE COMMANDER IN CHIEF COMPARED TO 45% FOR TRUMP.\nMEANWHILE, FORMER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ROBERT GATES, OFFERED A\nDIFFERENT VIEW OF BOTH POTENTIALS OVER THE WEEKEND,\nSAYING NEITHER CANDIDATE HAS DONE ANYTHING TO GIVE ANYONE\nCONFIDENCE. AT LEAST HE SAID ON NATIONAL\nSECURITY HE IS UNQUALIFIED AND UNFIT TO BE COMMANDER IN CHIEF.\nFOR EFFORTS TO PREPARE FOR THE OVAL OFFICE, BOTH CANDIDATES\nHAVE RALLIES THIS WEEK. TRUMP WILL HEAD BACK TO NEW YORK\nWHERE WE EXPECT HIM TO PARTICIPATE.\n>> DUSTING OFF SOME OF THOSE PERSONAL INROADS.\nWHO HE'S HIT AS THE SUFFERING IN SYRIA LOOKS AS THOUGH IT WILL\nSADLY BEGIN RESUMING.        IT'S SCARY WHEN\n       THE LIGHTS GO OUT. PEOPLE GET ANXIOUS AND MY OFFICE\nGETS FLOODED WITH CALLS. SO MANY THINGS CAN GO WRONG.     IT'S MY WORST NIGHTMARE.  EVERY SECOND THAT POWER IS OUT,            MY CITY'S AT RISK.   SIEMENS DIGITAL GRID\n  MANAGES AND REROUTES POWER,    SO SERVICE CAN BE RESTORED\n   WITHIN SECONDS.     PRIORITY NUMBER ONE IS\n    KEEPING THOSE LIGHTS ON.        IT TAKES INGENUITY      TO DEFEAT THE MONSTERS\n     THAT LIVE IN THE DARK.",

I DON'T THINK THERE'S A CLEAR\nADVANTAGE HERE FOR EITHER ONE OF THEM.\n>> DANA, IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE TRUMP AS WE JUST HEARD,\nHE GETS A LOT OF CRITICISM FROM FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY TYPES\nINCLUDING ROBERT GATES, THE FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY, WHO\nSERVED FOR REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTS, DEMOCRATIC\nPRESIDENTS. HE SAID HE'S BEYOND REPAIR,\nTRUMP, UNFIT TO BE COMMANDER IN CHIEF.\nHOW DOES TRUMP DEAL WITH THIS KIND OF CRITICISM, HOW CAN HE\nOVERCOME IT IN ORDER TO GET HIMSELF ELECTED?\n>> WELL, WE'VE SEEN HOW HE'S TRIED TO DEAL WITH IT.\nHE BLOWS IT OFF AND BELITTLES THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING AFTER\nHIM. AND YOU KNOW WHAT, CERTAINLY BOB\nGATES IS NOT THE FIRST PERSON TO HAVE BEEN IN THE JOB, WHETHER IT\nWAS UNDER THE REPUBLICAN -- MOST RECENT REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT\nGEORGE W. BUSH OR PRESIDENT OBAMA WHO HAVE SAID THAT HE IS\nNOT THE RIGHT GUY TO BE COMMANDER IN CHIEF.\nAND IF YOU'RE THE KIND OF PERSON OUT THERE WHO DAVID JUST\nDESCRIBED, WHO HE'S APPEALING TO, THE KIND OF PERSON WHO LOOKS\nAT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE WORLD, IS FRIGHTENED FOR EXACTLY WHAT\nWE SAW OVER THE WEEKEND, THEN IF YOU HEAR OF PEOPLE LIKE BOB\nGATES OR OTHER FORMER OFFICIALS, IT'S JUST LIKE NOISE TO THEM.\nAND DONALD TRUMP CAN AND IS TURNING IT INTO WHY ARE YOU\nGOING TO LISTEN TO THESE GUYS WHO GOT US INTO THE PROBLEMS\nTHAT WE'RE IN? AND BY THE WAY, HILLARY CLINTON\nWAS PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION THAT KIND OF ALLOWED ISIS TO\nSTART. I MEAN, YOU HEARD THAT OVER AND\nOVER AGAIN FROM DONALD TRUMP AND CERTAINLY MORE SO TODAY.\nSO, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT SURE THAT IT REALLY MATTERS THAT MUCH IN\nTHE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS, BECAUSE THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO\nA LOT OF VOTERS ARE LOOKING AT SAYING, MORE OF THE SAME.\nTHAT'S WHY THEY WANT DONALD TRUMP.\n>> YOU KNOW, BRIANNA, ONE WEEK FROM TONIGHT IS THE FIRST\nPRESIDENTIAL DEBATE AT HOFSTRA UNIVERSITY ON LONG ISLAND ISLAND\nIN NEW YORK. WE NOW HAVE BEEN TOLD THE DEBATE\nMODERATOR, LESTER HOLT, OF NBC NEWS, HAS CHOSEN SECURING\nAMERICA AS ONE OF THREE OVERARCHING THEMES IN THE\nDEBATE. OBVIOUSLY THAT'S VERY TIMELY\nGIVEN WHAT'S HAPPENED OVER THE WEEKEND.\n>> IT IS, AND -- OF COURSE, IT IS, BUT I THINK THERE'S ALSO\nTHIS QUESTION OF ARE VOTERS REALLY CARING ABOUT THAT, RIGHT?\nTHAT'S SORT OF THE QUESTION. HERE WE ARE, WE'RE SO CLOSE TO\nTHE ELECTION, BUT I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ALSO STRUCK BY\nEVENTS LIKE THIS HAPPENING AND VERY QUICKLY IN THE\nCONSCIOUSNESS OF VOTERS, IT KIND OF TAPERS OFF.\nYOU KNOW, MAYBE IF IT HAPPENED VERY CLOSE TO THE ELECTION, BUT\nHERE WE ARE TWO MONTHS OUT AND YOU WONDER IF SOMETHING LIKE\nTHIS IS GOING TO STICK. IT DOES SEEM, AND IT SEEMS LIKE\nTHE CANDIDATES ARE PLAYING MORE TO THE EMOTIONS, THE THINGS LIKE\nTHIS EVOKE. HILLARY CLINTON IS SAYING DO YOU\nWANT SOMEONE WHO IS DANGEROUS? DONALD TRUMP IS SAYING DO YOU\nWANT SOMEONE WHO IS WEAK? DONALD TRUMP IS SORT OF\nAPPEALING I THINK TO PEOPLE AT THE GUT LEVEL.\nHE'S SAYING, AS YOU SAID, DEAL WITH THE REFUGEE ISSUE, BUT WHEN\nYOU TALK TO SECURITY EXPERTS, THEY SAY EVEN THOUGH WHEN YOU\nLOOK AT WHO HAS COMMITTED ACTS OF TERROR IN THE U.S. AND YOU\nSEE THAT IT'S -- YOU SEE THAT IT'S NOT REALLY PEOPLE WHO ARE\nON VISAS LIKE THEY WERE FOR 9/11, ACTUALLY THAT'S WHERE THE\nGAPING SECURITY HOLE IS. THAT'S WHY YOU HEARD HILLARY\nCLINTON TODAY SAYING WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THE VISA PROGRAM.\nSO SHE'S KIND OF TARGETING MORE THE BRAIN AND HE'S TARGETING\nMORE THE GUT. I THINK THAT'S WHAT VOTERS WILL\nBE DECIDING IN SORT OF A MORE -- I THINK IT WILL COME DOWN TO\nSOMETHING A LITTLE MORE GENERAL AND SORT OF A FEELING, NOT JUST\nPOLICY. >> FIRST DEBATE ONE WEEK FROM\nTONIGHT, OF COURSE, WE'LL HAVE EXTENSIVE ALL-DAY COVERAGE OF\nTHAT.",

THE WAY DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY\nCLINTON ARE TALKING ABOUT THESE EVENTS IS UNDER THE MICROSCOPE.\nTRUMP HAS BEEN WRITING THINGS ON TWITTER, AS USUAL, INCLUDING\nCLAIMING THAT CLINTON'S, QUOTE, WEAKNESS AS SECRETARY OF STATE\nEMBOLDENED TERRORISTS ALL OVER THE WORLD.\nTHIS IS WHAT HE SAID AT A RALLY TODAY.\n>> THERE HAVE BEEN ISLAMIC TERRORIST ATTACKS IN MINNESOTA\nAND NEW YORK CITY AND IN NEW JERSEY.\nTHESE ATTACKS AND MANY OTHERS WERE MADE POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF\nOUR EXTREMELY OPEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM WHICH FAILS TO PROPERLY\nVET AND SCREEN THE INDIVIDUALS OR FAMILIES COMING INTO OUR\nCOUNTRY.

HERE'S SOME OF WHAT SHE SAID IN\nWHITE PLAINS, NEW YORK, TODAY. >> THERE ARE MILLIONS AND\nMILLIONS OF NATURALIZED CITIZENS IN AMERICA FROM ALL OVER THE\nWORLD. THERE ARE MILLIONS OF\nLAW-ABIDING, PEACEFUL MUSLIM AMERICANS.\nTHIS IS THE KIND OF CHALLENGE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN BE AND\nIS PREPARED TO ADDRESS, NAMELY GOING AFTER ANYONE WHO WOULD\nTHREATEN THE UNITED STATES. LET'S NOT GET DIVERTED AND\nDISTRACTED BY THE KIND OF CAMPAIGN RHETORIC WE HEAR COMING\nFROM THE OTHER SIDE. THIS IS A SERIOUS CHALLENGE.\nWE ARE WELL EQUIPPED TO MEET IT. AND WE CAN DO SO IN KEEPING WITH\nSMART LAW ENFORCEMENT, GOOD INTELLIGENCE, AND IN CONCERT\nWITH OUR VALUES. >> JOINING ME NOW IS CNN CHIEF\nPOLITICAL CORRESPONDENT DANA BASH.\nCNN POLITICAL ANALYST, JOURNALIST AND AUTHOR, CARL\nBERNSTEIN. CARL, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS?\nALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE INCIDENT IN NEW YORK HAPPENED,\nTHE CANDIDATES STARTED POSITIONING THEMSELVES ON THE\nISSUE. >> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, DONALD\nTRUMP HAS THOUGHT FROM THE BEGINNING THAT HE CAN EXPLOIT\nALL TERRORIST INCIDENTS INTO SOMETHING THAT WORKS IN HIS\nFAVOR, AND THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN VERY WORRIED ABOUT HIS\nABILITY TO DO JUST THAT. SO IT'S SOUGHT TO UNDERMINE HIS\nEXPLOITATION. THE SOUND BITE THAT WE JUST\nHEARD, IF ALL TRUMP HAD SAID WAS, WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL, THAT\nWOULD BE ONE THING. HE'S BEEN MUCH MORE INCENDIARY\nTHAN THAT. HE'S CALLED FOR ON OUTRIGHT BAN\nOF MUSLIMS ENDERING THE COUNTRY. HE'S USING THE RHETORIC TO\nFURTHER ENFLAME THIS ELECTORAL CYCLE AND CLINTON IS TRYING TO\nSAY, HEY, LOOK, THERE IS A SMART WAY TO FIGHT TERRORISM, IT\nREQUIRES NUANCE, IT REQUIRES KNOWLEDGE, AND WE CAN'T JUST GO\nABOUT THIS BY SUSPENDING CIVIL LIBERTIES AND SCREAMING THAT THE\nHOUSE IS ON FIRE. >> DANA, OUR LATEST CNN NATIONAL\nPOLL SHOWS THAT IN TERMS OF WHO WOULD BETTER HANDLE TERRORISM,\nOR WHO COULD BETTER HANDLE TERRORISM, TRUMP LEADS CLINTON\nBY SIX POINTS AND WEB IHEN IT C TO THE QUESTION OF WHO COULD\nBETTER HANDLE BEING COMMANDER IN CHIEF, CLINTON LEADS TRUMP BY\nFIVE POINTS. IT'S NOT REALLY CLEAR CUT WHO\nPOLITICALLY IS, IN THE MIBNDS O VOTERS, ABLE TO HANDLE SOMETHING\nLIKE THIS THE BEST. >> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.\nTHOSE NUMBERS ARE SO FASCINATING AND REALLY I THINK CRYSTALIZE\nWHAT EACH CANDIDATE IS TRYING TO PUT FORWARD DURING TIMES LIKE\nTHESE FOR THE VOTERS. THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF QUESTION,\nTHAT'S WHERE HILLARY CLINTON DOES BETTER AMONG VOTERS WHICH\nIS WHY YOU SAW HER GO OUT AND HAVE A VERY CALM, VERY STEADY,\nVERY LET'S DEAL WITH THE FACTS AND ONLY THE FACTS KIND OF\nAPPROACH TO THIS BECAUSE SHE'S APPEALING TO VOTERS WHO WANT\nTHAT, WHO WANT SOMEBODY WHO THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH WHO'S NOT\nGOING TO, YOU KNOW, GO BY THEIR GUT OR GO BY THEIR EMOTION.\nBUT DONALD TRUMP IS APPEALING TO VOTERS WHO VERY MUCH WANT THE\nOPPOSITE, AS CARL WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT.\nTHAT'S WHAT SPEAKS TO THE FACT THAT HE IS DOING BETTER AMONG\nTHOSE WHO WANT A COMMANDER IN CHIEF OR SOMEBODY WHO'S GOING TO\nFIGHT TERRORISM BECAUSE HE IS GOING WITH THAT KIND OF VISCERAL\nFEELING OF WE GOT TO GET THESE GUYS AND IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT\nTHE COSTS ARE, WHETHER IT IS RACIAL PROFILING OR CIVIL\nLIBERTIES OR IMMIGRATION POLICIES.\nAND THOSE ARE TWO VERY, VERY DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS AND IT\nREALLY DOES SPEAK TO WHERE THE VOTERS ARE GOING TO GO.\nARE THEY GOING TO GO WITH THEIR GUT OR ARE THEY GOING TO GO WITH\nTHEIR HEAD? >> WELL, BECAUSE, I MEAN, TO\nTHAT POINT, CARL, IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE WHAT DONALD\nTRUMP IS TALKING ABOUT IS, YOU KNOW, REFUGEES, TOUGHER\nSCREENING OF PEOPLE COMING TO THE U.S.\nTHIS WAS A FAMILY THAT CAME TO THE U.S., YOU KNOW, I THINK MORE\nTHAN 20 YEARS AGO. IN THIS GUY'S 28, WAS HERE WHEN\nHE WAS 6 YEARS OLD, IT'S BEEN 22 YEARS.\n>> RIGHT. >> NO AMOUNT OF, YOU KNOW,\nSCREENING OF THE PARENTS FROM BACK THEN COULD PREDICT WHAT A\nPERSON'S GOING TO DO 22 YEARS LATER.\n>> WE NEED SMART SCREENING. A WAR ON TERROR IS THE MOST\nDIFFICULT, STRATEGIC, IN TERMS OF STRATEGIC DECISIONS, WAR\nPERHAPS THAT WE HAVE EVER FOUGHT, SO IT REQUIRES ALL KINDS\nOF NUANCE. WHAT TRUMP IS DOING, AND\nCERTAINLY YOU CAN GET PEOPLE EVEN AROUND HIM TO ACKNOWLEDGE\nTHIS, IS TO INCITE A CERTAIN FEELING AGAINST MUSLIMS.\nTHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF SOME OF THIS RHETORIC.\nAND WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT IN THE LARGER CONTEXT OF HOW HE'S RUN\nHIS CAMPAIGN IN TERMS OF IMMIGRATION, IN TERMS OF\nNATIVISM, BIGOTRY, ET CETERA, AND THIS GOES TO THE HEART OF\nWHAT THIS ELECTION IS AND WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY WE ARE AND WE'RE\nGOING TO BE. IT'S TWO VERY DIFFERENT VISIONS.\nAND IT'S PRETTY MUCH OUT THERE FOR ALL PEOPLE TO SEE AT THIS\nPOINT WHAT THIS ELECTION IS AND WHAT'S AT STAKE.\n>> DANA, HOW CONCERNED DO YOU THINK THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS\nRIGHT NOW WITH THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS\nHAD AND THIS TIGHTENING OF POLL NUMBERS?\n>> THEY ARE, AND THEY SHOULD BE. THEY ARE TIGHTENING, RIGHTLY,\nAND WHEN THINGS LIKE THIS HAPPEN, HISTORICALLY, FOR THE\nREASONS THAT CARL JUST STATED, IT HAS BEEN BENEFICIAL TO DONALD\nTRUMP EVEN THOUGH HILLARY CLINTON IS TRYING TO USE THESE\nKINDS OF INCIDENTS AS PROOF THAT, YOU KNOW, IN HER WORDS,\nFROM HER PERSPECTIVE, YOU DON'T NEED SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T HAVE\nTHE TEMPERAMENT TO BE PRESIDENT AT THIS TIME.\nBUT, YEAH, IT'S BEEN A VERY, VERY TOUGH FEW WEEKS FOR HER,\nAND THE ONLY -- THE MAIN THING THAT THEY ARE RELYING ON AT THIS\nLATE STAGE OF THE GAME IS THE GET-OUT-THE-VOTE OPERATION.\n>> RIGHT. >> THE FACT THEY HAVE THE PEOPLE\nON THE GROUND IN THESE SWING STATES TO GET PEOPLE OUT AND\nTHAT THEY, BECAUSE SHE'S A DEMOCRAT, THEY HAVE A MORE CLEAR\nPATH",

FIRST, HERE IS TRUMP FROM\nFLORIDA. >> THERE HAVE BEEN ISLAMIC\nTERRORIST ATTACKS IN MINNESOTA AND NEW YORK CITY\nAND IN NEW JERSEY. THESE ATTACKS AND MANY\nOTHERS WERE MADE POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF OUR EXTREMELY\nOPEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM WHICH FAILS TO PROPERLY VET\nAND SCREEN THE INDIVIDUALS OR FAMILIES COMING INTO OUR\nCOUNTRY.

IN THE MIDDLE EAST, WE HAVE\nTO SMASH ISIS'S STRONGHOLDS WITH AN ACCELERATED\nCOALITION AIR CAMPAIGN, MORE SUPPORT FOR ARAB AND KURDISH\nFORCES ON THE GROUND. AND INTENSE DIPLOMATIC\nEFFORTS IN SYRIA, IRAQ, AND ACROSS THE REGION.\nTHERE ARE MILLIONS OF LAW ABIDING, PEACEFUL MUSLIM\nAMERICANS.

I DROPPED EVERYTHING IN MY HANDS\nAND BOOKED BACK TO MY CO-WORKER TO NOTIFY HER WHAT WAS GOING ON.\nI RAN OUT A DIFFERENT EXIT OUT OF OUR J.C.

IT IS AN ACT OF TERRORISM\nULTIMATELY. THE INTENTION WAS TO KILL, MAIM\nAND INJURY AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE.\nWE'RE VERY FORTUNATE THAT THERE WERE NO FATALITIES IN THESE.\n>> SAJJAN, YOU TALKED ABOUT THE WORD TERRORISM.\nLET'S GET INTO THE SEMANTICS OF THAT WORD BECAUSE WE KNOW THE\nGOVERNOR OF NEW YORK IS CALLING IT TERRORISM.\nTHE CITY OF NEW YORK AS THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUES IS NOT\nCLASSIFYING THIS AS TERRORISM PER SE.\nOBVIOUSLY, THEY HAVE INFORMATION THAT THEY'RE USING, AND THEY'RE\nLOOKING INTO THE CASE. THEY HAVE REASON FOR DOING THAT,\nBUT FROM WHAT YOU READ INTO IT, CAN YOU JUST KIND OF GIVE OUR\nVIEWERS AN UNDERSTANDING AS TO WHY THERE MAY SEEM TO BE SOME\nDIFFERENCE BETWEEN, YOU KNOW, WHY SOME WOULD SAY TERRORISM,\nWHY OTHERS MAY NOT AT THIS POINT.\n>> GEORGE, IN MANY WAYS, THESE ARE DIFFERENCES WITHOUT A CLEAR\nDISTINCTION BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE DEVICES IN NEW YORK, FOR\nEXAMPLE, THAT THE AUTHORITIES DISCOVERED, THESE WERE PRESSURE\nCOOKERS WITH NAILS. THEY HAD TIME DEVICES.\nTHIS WAS DESIGNED TO GO OFF AND KILL AND MAIM PEOPLE AND THE\nSECOND DEVICE MAY HAVE ALSO BEEN TIMED IN A WAY THAT IT WOULD HIT\nPEOPLE RUNNING IN A SPECIFIC DIRECTION.\nTHIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST WITH TERRORISM.\nSOME ARE DRAWING COMPARISONS WITH THE DWI THAT WERE USED AT\nTHE BOSTON MARATHON BOMBING A FEW YEARS AGO.\nTHIS IS SOMETHING I'M AFRAID THAT WE'RE SEEING NOW FAR TOO\nOFTEN, WHETHER IT IS DIRECTED BY A LARGE TRANSNATIONAL TERRORIST\nGROUP OR AN INDIVIDUAL THAT IS ACTING ON HIS OWN, WE ARE SEEING\nMORE INCIDENTS AND SOMETIMES THEY LACK THE SKILL AND\nINGENUITY TO BE ABLE TO PULL OFF A SUCCESSFUL ATTACK.\nTHAT IS FORTUNATE. IT'S GOING TO ULTIMATELY COME\nDOWN TO THE INVESTIGATION BY THE NYPD, THE JOINT TERRORISM TASK\nFORCE IN NEW YORK PERHAPS USING US CCTV TO SEE WHO THE SUSPECT\nOR SUSPECTS WERE. WE WILL FIND OUT SOONER RATHER\nTHAN LATER. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS REMAIN\nUNCLEAR. >> YES, THEY HAVE A LOT OF\nDIFFERENT LEADS AND THEY'RE PROBABLY PUTTING ALL THE PIECES\nOF THE PUZZLE TOGETHER. SO YES, SOMEBODY IS BEHIND THIS.\nWE DON'T KNOW WHO, BUT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING, SAJJAN, FOR THE\nPAST FEW WEEKS THAT THE ISIS STORY AS THEY LOSE TERRITORY IN\nIRAQ AND SYRIA, THEY HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGING THESE LONE WOLF\nATTACKS ELSEWHERE. SO THAT IS SOMETHING REGARDLESS\nOF WHO'S BEHIND THIS, THAT IS SOMETHING TO FOLLOW.\nAND ALSO, JUST RECENTLY, A DRONE STRIKE KILLED THE HEAD OF\nPROPAGANDA FOR ISIS, AS WELL. >> THAT INDIVIDUAL THAT YOU\nMENTIONED AL ADNANI WAS A VERY SIGNIFICANT MEMBER OF ISIS.\nHE WASN'T JUST IN CHARGE OF PROPAGANDA BUT HEAD OF THE\nEXTERNAL OPERATIONS. WHENEVER HE ISSUED A MESSAGE IT\nTENDED TO SPUR ON LONE WOLF ATTACKS AROUND THE WORLD.\nIN HIS DEATH THERE HAS BEEN CONCERN THERE COULD BE REPRISAL\nATTACKS GLOBALLY. AS ISIS LOSES TERRITORY IN IRAQ\nAND SYRIA, YOU CAN USE THE ANALOGY OF A CORONERED RAT.\nUNFORTUNATELY, WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS IN MANY WAYS THE NEW NORMAL\nWHERE THESE INCIDENTS WILL KEEP HAPPENING, THE AUTHORITIES WILL\nKEEP HAVING TO DISRUPT THEM. SOMETIMES LUCK WILL BE REQUIRED\nTHAT THE DEVICE ISN'T ABLE TO ACTUALLY KILL AND HURT PEOPLE\nAND UNFORTUNATELY, TIMING WILL ALSO BE SIGNIFICANT TOO AS WAS\nMENTIONED EARLIER THAT THESE INCIDENTS COINCIDE WITH THE U.N.\nGENERAL ASSEMBLY MEETING. IF THE ATTACK CAN'T KILL PEOPLE,\nIT IS DESIGNED TO CREATE DISRUPTION.\nREGARDLESS OF WHAT THE IDEOLOGICAL MOTIVATION IS.\n>> LIVE FOR US, GIVING INSIGHT INTO THIS SITUATION.\nSO MANY DIFFERENT SITUATIONS TO TALK ABOUT.\nBUT IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT, SAJJAN, THAT NO INTERNATIONAL\nTERROR GROUP HAS LABELED ANY RESPONSIBILITY ANY CLAIMS TO\nWHAT WE'VE SEEN IN NEW YORK, IN NEW JERSEY.\n>> STILL A MYSTERY FOR SURE. >> ABSOLUTELY.\nINVESTIGATORS STAYING ON IT.",

THE FBI CALLING THE WEEKEND\nSTABBING SPREE AT A MINNESOTA SHOPPING MALL, \"A POTENTIAL ACT\nOF TERRORISM.\" AN ISIS-LINKED NEWS AGENCY IS\nPRAISING THE ATTACKER AS A \"SOLDIER OF THE ISLAMIC STATE.\"\nROSA IS LIVE IN ST. CLOUD, MINNESOTA.\nWHAT IS THE LATEST, ROSA? >> CHRIS, GOOD MORNING.\nLET ME GET YOU UP TO SPEED HERE. ACCORDING TO POLICE ONE MAN\nUSING A PRIVATE SECURITY COMPANY UNIFORM WALK UNDER TO THE MALL\nTHAT YOU SEE BEHIND ME, MADE A REFERENCE TO ALLAH AND ASKED A\nCOUPLE OF PEOPLE IF THEY WERE MUSLIM BEFORE ATTACKING THEM\nWITH A KNIFE. NOW, AUTHORITIES ARE NOT\nIDENTIFYING THIS MAN AT THIS TIME, BUT SATURDAY NIGHT BY THE\nEND OF THE NIGHT HE HAD STABBED NINE PEOPLE.\nTHREE OF THEM ARE STILL IN THE HOSPITAL.\nONE WITH LIFE-THREATENING INJURIES.\nNOW, AUTHORITIES SAY THAT THIS COULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH WORSE.\nOFFICIAL OS WHO HAVE SEEN THE SURVEILLANCE VIDEO SAY THAT ONE\nMAN IS HAILED A HERO. OFF-DUTY POLICE OFFICER JASON\nFALCONER. THEY SAY HE SHOT AND KILLED THE\nSUSPECT IN THIS CASE AND EVEN SHOOTING HIM DOWN WHEN THIS\nSUSPECT WAS LUNGING AT HIM. NOW, LIKE YOU MENTIONED, A NEWS\nAGENCY LINKED TO ISIS HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY CALLING\nTHIS SUSPECT A SOLDIER OF THE ISLAMIC STATE.\nNOW, CNN CANNOT INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRM THOSE DETAILS, BUT, OF\nCOURSE, AS YOU MENTIONED, THE FBI IS INVESTIGATING THIS AS A\nPOSSIBLE ACT OF TERRORISM. >> ROSA, THANK YOU FOR ALL OF\nTHAT. LET'S DISCUSS ALL OF THE\nDEVELOPMENTS WITH JULIET, OUR CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST,\nPHIL MUDD AND FORMER COUNTERTERRORISM OFFICIAL AND\nMICHAEL WEISS CO-AUTHOR OF \"ISIS INSIDE THE ARMY OF TERROR.\"\nTHANKS FOR ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE.\nLET'S TALK ABOUT THESE THREE LOCATIONSS OF ALL THESE DIFFERET\nBOMBS. THE MOST RECENT ELIZABETH AT\nTHIS TRAIN STATION FOUND LAST NIGHT AND THE CHELSEA\nNEIGHBORHOOD IN MANHATTAN AND SEASIDE PARK IN NEW JERSEY ALONG\nTHE ROUTE OF WHAT WAS A CHARITY RUN.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK THE SIGNIFICANCE IS DO YOU THINK\nTHEY ARE COORDINATED? >> I THINK WE DON'T KNOW YET.\nI'LL TAKE THE FACTS AND TELL YOUR VIEWERS ABOUT THE\nCONNECTION. I THINK NO QUESTION IF WE JUST\nSTART FROM THE BEGINNING OR START FROM THE MIDDLE, WHICH IS\nTHE NEW YORK ATTACKS ON 23rd AND 27th.\nYOU HAVE THE SAME INDIVIDUAL AND VERY SIMILAR BOMBS.\nGOING BACK A DAY TO NEW JERSEY. STARTING THE WEEKEND, ALL WE\nHAVE HEARD IS THAT THERE ARE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN NEW JERSEY\nAND NEW YORK. BUT WE DON'T KNOW IF MATERIALS\nFOUND IN THE BOMBS ON SATURDAY ARE THE SAME IN NEW YORK ARE THE\nSAME AS THOSE IN NEW JERSEY. THOSE INCLUDE ALUMINUM POWER AND\nT T\nTANARITE AND THOSE ARE THINGS THAT ARE EASILY PURCHASED\nANYWHERE. WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THE\nEXPLOSIVES BUT COINCIDENCES LIKE THIS DON'T HAPPEN VERY OFTEN.\nIF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS IN THE TOTALITY, YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IT\nOVER THE COURSE OF THE WEEKEND. WHAT WE HAVE ON THE\nINVESTIGATION SIDE IS, OBVIOUSLY, THE SAME PERSON ON\nSATURDAY NIGHT, AS YOU GUYS REPORTED LAST NIGHT.\nAND VIDEO SURVEILLANCE AT VARIOUS PLACES THAT MAY HELP.\nRIGHT NOW INVESTIGATORS ARE DEPENDENT ON MATERIALS IN TERMS\nOF CONNECTING THE THINGS AND SURVEILLANCE.\nAND THAT'S ESSENTIALLY HOW THIS WILL UNFOLD.\nYOU KNOW, THERE'S THESE GUYS THAT ARE NOW JUST STOPPED IN THE\nCAR AND WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH TO SIMPLY MAKE SPECULATION OF WHAT\nTHAT IS. THAT'S WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW.\n>> MOVING VERY QUICKLY. DIFFERENT STATES, OBVIOUSLY, ALL\nWORKING IN COORDINATION WITH THE FEDS ON THIS.\nTHEY DO BELIEVE THERE'S SIMILARITIES AND DETONATION\nTECHNIQUES VERY CRUDE ONES FOUND ON THE INTERNET OR MAGAZINE\nWHERE YOU CAN FIND TO DO THIS KIND OF STUFF.\nYOU HAVE THREE PHASES. HOW THE PROSECUTORS ARE LOOKING\nAT IT, WHICH IS WHERE YOUR MIND GOES.\nHOW THE INVESTIGATORS LOOK AT THIS AND WE HAVE PHIL MUDD FOR\nTHAT AND THE LARGER MOTIVATIONS HERE AND WE HAVE MICHAEL FOR\nTHAT. PHIL, WHEN YOU'RE SIZING UP THIS\nINVESTIGATION, MULTIPLE EVENTS POPPING UP AND SIMILAR IN TERMS\nOF WHAT THESE PEOPLE DID TO PUT THE BOMBS AND HOW THEY LOOK.\nWHAT ARE THE PHASES? >> LOOK, THE FIRST PHASE IS\nOPENING UP THE FACTS. I THIRD PEOPLE, FOR EXAMPLE,\nTALK ABOUT THIS IS TERRORISM. THAT IS NOT A FACT, CHRIS.\nTHE FACT IS WE HAVE DEVICES AND THE FBI LABS SHOULD BE ABLE TO\nTELL VERY QUICKLY WHETHER, FOR EXAMPLE, THE WIRING IN THOSE\nDEVICES INDICATES THE SAME INDIVIDUAL WIRED BOTH OF THEM.\nWE HAVE VIDEO AND WE HAVE CALL INS.\nYOU MIGHT HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT A STOP OF SOME SUSPECTS OR PERSONS\nOF INTEREST. AND LICENSE PLATES FROM VEHICLES\nTHAT WERE GOING THROUGH THE AREA.\nSO, WE'RE SPECULATING ON WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED HERE BUT\nINSIDE THIS GAME INVESTIGATORS IF YOU LISTEN TO THE LAST MOMENT\nOF CONVERSATION, INVESTIGATORS HAVE A LARGE VOLUME OF DATA THAT\nTHEY'RE ALREADY STARTING TO SORT THROUGH.\nTHAT WILL TAKE THEM A COUPLE DAYS, CHRIS, BEFORE THE FACTS\nNARROW DOWN. >> HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT\nBECAUSE COMMON SENSE TELLS YOU, SOMEBODY'S DOING THIS TO DISRUPT\nOUR WAY OF LIFE. IT'S A HOMICIDAL ACT WITHOUT A\nSPECIFIC TARGET. IT'S TERRORISM.\nYOU'RE SAYING, NO. IS THAT THE MIND OF THE\nINVESTIGATOR BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO MAKE A CASE AS SUCH?\n>> NO, IT'S BECAUSE TERRORISM REQUIRES A POLITICAL MOTIVATION\nAND I DON'T KNOW THE MOTIVATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL.\nLET'S ASSUME, FOR EXAMPLE, A MALE WHO LOST HIS GIRLFRIEND AND\nWANT TO BLOW UP A BLOCK. IF YOU WANT TO TELL ME YOU KNOW\nWHAT THIS PERSON WAS TRYING TO DO, I WOULD TELL YOU, HOW WOULD\nYOU KNOW THAT? I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT THE\nMOTIVATION WAS AND WHETHER THIS WAS AN ACT OF TERROR BEFORE I\nUNDERSTAND WHAT WAS IN HIS MIND OR HER MIND.\n>> MICHAEL, NO CLAIM OF RESPONSIBILITY FROM ISIS.\nWHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO YOU? >> NOTHING.\n>> THIS COULD BE, AS PHIL WAS POINTING OUT, SOME GRIEVED\nLUNETIC WHO WANTED TO KILL AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT\nANY POLITICAL MOTIVATION. IF IT WAS JIHADIISIS HAS TWO\nMAIN TACTICS THEY CHOOSE FROM. ONE IS THE ISIS DIRECTED ATTACK\nSUCH AS PARIS AND BRUSSELS AND NICE AND THE OTHER IS THE\nISIS-INSPIRED ATTACK OR THE LONE  THE ISIS SPOKESMAN THAT THE\nCOALITION KILLED A COUPLE WEEKS IN 2014 CAME OUT WITH THIS,\nBASICALLY A GLOBAL INJUNCTION TO ALL MUSLIMS TO KILL THE INFIDEL\nWHEREVER YOU TAKE HIM. DRIVE OVER HIM, TAKE A KNIFE AND\nSTAB HIM. THESE ARE THE INDIVIDUAL\nSOLDIERS OF IT. NOW, ISIS MAY NOT KNOW IF THIS\nWAS ISIS-INSPIRED YET. THEY DID COME OUT OR CLAIM\nRESPONSIBILITY. THEY ARE NOT THE ONLY JIHADIST\nORGANIZATION. WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH YET ABOUT\nNEW YORK. MINNESOTA, I'M MORE INCLINED TO\nSAY IT'S -- >> LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.\nTHAT WAS A MALL ATTACK THAT SOMEBODY CLAIMED -- I THINK THAT\nIS ISIS-INSPIRED AND HE WAS ABLE TO STAND MULTIPLE PEOPLE BEFORE\nBEING KILLED. >> THAT IS MORE ISIS-DIRECTED.\nHE CAME OUT AND SAID HE'S A SOLDIER OF AN ISLAMIC STATE THAT\nSUGGESTS THEY PROBABLY KNEW AND WHAT WORRIES ME IS I INTERVIEW\nPEOPLE WITHIN ISIS AND A FEW MONTHS AGO A GUY I PROFILED IN\n\"THE DAILY BEAST\" A MEMBER OF THEIR SPY SERVICE, THE STATE\nSECURITY OR THE FBI OF ISIS HAS INFORMANTS PLACED WITHIN ISIS\nINCLUDING IN THE FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE BRANCH WHICH PLANS\nTHESE ATTACKS OVERSEAS. HE TOLD ME IN THE NEXT THREE\nMONTHS OR SO THEY'RE PLANNING SOMETHING IN MINNESOTA.\nSPECIFICALLY GOING BE FROM THE SOMALI, WE CAN'T CONFIRM THIS,\nBUT LOCAL REPORTING IN MINNESOTA SUGGESTS THIS GUY WAS A\n22-YEAR-OLD AND BORN IN KENYA BUT OF SOMALI BACKGROUND.\nI SHARE THIS INFORMATION WITH THE FBI AND THEY SAID, THANKS,\nWE'LL LOOK INTO IT AND NEVER REALLY HEARD BACK FROM THEM.\n>> YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS IN DIFFERENT PHASES.\nI GET THAT IT'S FRUSTRATING FOR PEOPLE.\nEVEN THIS TERRORISM QUESTION. IT'S A VERY STRAIGHT SHOT FOR\nPHILIP MUDD. JULIET, WE DEAL WITH THIS ALL\nTHE TIME AND WE GET IT. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO\nNONINVESTIGATIVE PEOPLE. WHO ELSE PLANTS BOMBS IN RANDOM\nAREAS WHERE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE OTHER THAN SOMEBODY WHO IS UP\nTO NO GOOD AND AFFECT OUR WAY OF LIFE.\nWHY ISN'T THAT ENOUGH? IS THE DISTINCTION BECAUSE\nYOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO INTO COURT AND MAKE A CASE AND IT\nCAN'T BE IT FEELS LIKE SOMETHING?\n>> IT'S ALL OF THE ABOVE. LOOK, NONE OF US ARE QUESTIONING\nTHE TERROR OCCURRED IN PARTICULAR.\nYOU KNOW, ON SATURDAY MORNING, SATURDAY NIGHT AND FEAR OF\nTERROR. THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN A\nPROSECUTOR NEEDING TO MAKE A TERRORISM CASE AND REITERATING\nWHAT WE SAID ALL WEEK. WE DON'T KNOW WHO THE CULPRITS\nARE. A NUMBER OF MOTIVATIONS.\nTHEY MAY SEEM OBVIOUS TO US THAT THIS IS A POLITICALLY MOTIVATED.\nWE TALK ABOUT STAITERROR AND IS AND YOU DON'T WANT INVESTIGATORS\nGOING INTO AN INVESTIGATION ASSUMING TOO MUCH BECAUSE YOU'RE\nGOING TO MISS CLUES. THAT'S WHY YOUR ANALYSTS ARE\nSAYING, LOOK AT THE FACTS. THE FACTS GIVE YOU A LOT AND\nTHEN WE GO FROM THERE. >> PANEL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH\nFOR ALL OF YOUR EXPEER RTEXPERT. WE WILL HAVE NEW INFORMATION AS\nIT DEVELOPS THROUGHOUT THE HOUR.",

THIS AS INVESTIGATORS BELIEVE A\nTERROR CELL COULD BE BEHIND BOTH THE BOMBING IN NEW YORK CITY,\nAND THE BLAST AT A MARINE RACE IN SEASIDE PARK, NEW JERSEY ON\nSATURDAY. LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS WITH THE\nDIRECTOR OF THE GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY'S PROGRAM\nON EXTREMISM. AND JOINING US AGAIN CNN'S\nSENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST TOM FUENTES.\nTHANKS TO BOTH OF YOU. TOM, I JUST WANT TO START WITH\nYOU WITH THIS MANHUNT. WE'RE FINDING OUT A LITTLE BIT\nMORE INFORMATION ABOUT THIS SUSPECT.\nHE'S A NATURALIZED CITIZEN. HE WAS BORN IN AFGHANISTAN.\nWE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG HE'S LIVED IN THE UNITED STATES.\nBUT, POLICE SEEM TO HAVE A BEAT ON HIM AND SEEM TO BE HOT ON THE\nTRAIL PERHAPS? >> WELL, PERHAPS, CAROL.\nAND I THINK THE JOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCE IN NEW YORK CITY AS\nWELL AS IN NEW JERSEY SURE ARE WORKING VERY CLOSELY TOGETHER ON\nTHIS. AND THEY MAY HAVE ALREADY HAD\nREASON TO BE LOOKING AT HIM BEFORE ALL THIS STARTED.\nYOU KNOW, WE DON'T KNOW. AND WE'LL FIND THAT OUT AT A\nLATER DATE. SO WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH\nINFORMATION THEY HAVE ABOUT HIM. BUT I WOULD PRO-ASSUME IT'S A\nLOT BY THIS TIME THEY'VE DONE NEIGHBORHOOD SEARCHES, TALKED TO\nFRIEND, NEIGHBORS, CHECKED SOCIAL MEDIA, ANY PHONE CALLS,\nCOMPUTERS, E-MAILS, ANYTHING THEY CAN FIND ON HIM OR THEIR\nASSOCIATES. SO THERE'S A GOOD POSSIBILITY\nTHEY KNOW A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN WE KNOW OBVIOUSLY AND THAT THEIR\nBIG -- RIGHT NOW THEIR BIG CONCERN IS THE REST OF THE\nGROUP. NOT JUST HIM, BUT ARE MORE\nATTACKS IN THE WORKS. IS THAT POSSIBLE?\nAND THIS IS WHAT WE SAW IN EUROPE, WHERE YOU KNOW YOU KEPT\nHAVING THIS REPEAT OF ATTACKS BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN FRANCE\nAND BELGIUM, BECAUSE PARTS OF THE CELL WERE STILL OUT THERE\nAND STILL WORKING. EVEN WHEN THEY HAD SUICIDE\nBOMBERS THEY STILL HAD PARTS OF THE CELLS OUT THERE.\nAND CONTINUING TO DO ATTACKS. SO THAT'S THE MAIN CONCERN RIGHT\nNOW FOR EVERYBODY IN THIS INVESTIGATION, IS TO WRAP UP\nEVERYBODY IF THEY CAN BEFORE THEY DO SOMETHING ELSE.\n>> AND OF COURSE THERE'S ALWAYS CONCERN THAT SUSPECTS CHANGE\nTHEIR APPEARANCE, RIGHT? SO THE NEW JERSEY POLICE JUST\nRELEASED ON TWITTER THESE ALTERNATE PICTURES OF THE\nSUSPECT AND THERE THEY ARE. YOU SEE HIM THOUGHT HAIR.\nHE LOOKS QUITE DIFFERENT IN EACH PICTURE.\nSO THIS WON'T BE SO EASY. >> NO, NONE OF THIS IS EASY.\nTAKES A GREAT DEAL OF WORK, GREAT DEAL OF EXPERTISE TO DO\nTHIS. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE TALK ABOUT\nFACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE. BUT, BUT FACIAL HAIR AND HOW\nMUCH FACIAL HAIR, AND SUNGLASSES, AND IF THEY'RE\nWEARING CAPS ALL MAKES IT THAT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT.\nTHERE'S A LOT THAT JUST HAS TO COME FROM OLD-FASHIONED SHOE\nLITHER AND GOING OUT AND TALKING TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE\nTHAT KNOW THIS INDIVIDUAL OR HAVE WORKED WITH HIM, OR\nSTUDENTS WITH HIM. OR ANY OTHER ASSOCIATION TO\nLEARN AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ABOUT NOT JUST HIM, BUT WHO DOES HE\nASSOCIATE WITH. WHO IS HE AFFILIATED WITH?\nWHO ARE HIS FRIENDS?  ONE'S CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR\nTHIS. IN MINNESOTA THERE WAS THE MALL\nSTABBING AND ISIS JUMPED RIGHT ON THE BANDWAGON SAID YES IT WAS\nONE OF OUR RECRUITS. ONE OF OUR SOLDIERS OPERATING\nWITHIN THE UNITED STATES. BUT THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN WITH THE\nBOMBING IN NEW YORK CITY, OR THE BOMBS FOUND IN NEW JERSEY.\nWHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS? >> IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY AT THIS\nPOINT. I THINK IT'S TOO EARLY TO SAY.\nWHAT WE HAVE SEEN ALSO FROM SOME DYNAMICS IN EUROPE IS THAT ISIS\nCLAIMS RESPONSIBILITY FOR ATTACKS WHICH ARE CARRIED OUT BY\nPEOPLE WHO HAVE NO NORMAL AFFILIATION TO IT WHEN THAT\nINDIVIDUAL SENDS A MESSAGE TO ISIS.\nTHAT HAPPENED IN FRANCE SEVERAL TIMES FOR EXAMPLE.\nSOMEBODY HAS NO PRIOR CONNECTION TO ISIS, BUT A FEW HOURS AND NOT\nA FEW MINUTES BEFORE CARRYING OUT AN ATTACK SENDS A MESSAGE TO\nISIS SAYING I'M ABOUT TO CARRY OUT AN ATTACK AND PLEDGING\nALLEGIANCE. ISIS THEN CLAIMS RESPONSIBILITY.\nOR THEY HAVE CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR ATTACKS IN\nWHICH NO SET CONNECTION WAS MADE BUT IT WAS CLEAR IT WAS SOMEBODY\nWHO EMBRACED ISIS IDEOLOGY. IN THIS CASE PROBABLY THEY WERE\nBASICALLY IN THE DARK AS MUCH AS WE WERE FOR A LONG TIME ABOUT\nWHO EXACTLY WAS BEHIND THIS. I MEAN IT'S DIFFICULT TO KNOW.\nI WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THEY WERE TO COME UP AND NEXT FEW\nHOURS OR FEW DAYS CLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS AS WELL\nAS THEY HAVE DONE IN THE PAST. CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR ATTACKS\nTHAT TOOK PLACE WEEKS PRIOR TO THEIR COMMUNIQUES.\n>> AND HERE'S WHY IT MAY BE JUST SO DIFFICULT TO REALLY FIGURE\nTHESE OUT SO, SO, SO THE FOR EXAMPLE THE PRESSURE COOKER\nBOMBS THAT WERE THE ONE THAT WAS UNEXPLODED THAT WAS FOUND IN NEW\nYORK CITY. POLICE FOUND CHRISTMAS LIGHTS,\nFLIP PHONES, IN THAT PRESSER COOKER AND IT WAS VERY SIMILAR\nTO BOSTON BUT THE BOSTON ATTACKS DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ANYTHING TO\nDO WITH ISIS. BUT CHRISTMAS LIGHTS AND FLIP\nPHONES WERE ALSO FOUND IN THE SAN BERNARDINO SHOOTER'S HOME\nBUT HE WAS CONNECTED TO ISIS. >> I THINK THE REALITY OF IT\nWHEN IT COMES TO A LOT OF THESE INDIVIDUALS AT THE GRASSROOTS\nLEVEL WHETHER IN THE STATES OR IN EUROPE, PARTICULARLY IN THE\nSTATES, THEY REALLY DON'T CARE THAT MUCH ABOUT WHETHER IT'S AL\nQAEDA OR ISIS. THEY EMBRACE THE GENERAL\nJIHADIST IDEOLOGY. THEY HATE THE WEST, THEY HATE\nAMERICA. THEY AS MUCH AS AL QAEDA AND\nISIS ARE FIGHTING EACH OTHER ON THE GROUND IN THE MIDDLE EAST,\nTO SOME DEGREE TO HOME GROWN RADICALIZED INDIVIDUAL, SOMEBODY\nWHO HAS NO CONNECTION TO ORGANIZED GROUP, THOSE PETTY\nSQUABBLES BETWEEN ISIS AND AL QAEDA MATTER ONLY TO SOME AGREE.\nSO THEY MIGHT PICK UP INSTRUCTIONS FROM INSPIRE WHICH\nIS THE AL QAEDA MAGAZINE, AND THEN ALSO SYMPATHIZE WITH ISIS.\nTO THEM IT'S ABOUT A GENERAL IDEOLOGY AND GENERAL HATRED FOR\nTHE WEST. >> ALL RIGHT.\nTOM FUENTES, LORENZO VIDINO, THANKS TO BOTH OF YOU.\nAPPARENTLY INVESTIGATORS ARE LINKING THIS SUSPECT, THIS\nNATURALIZED CITIZEN THAT WE'VE BEEN SHOWING YOU TO THE SEASIDE\nPARK YOU KNOW THEY FOUND EXPLOSIVES THERE, AND THEY'RE\nALSO CONNECTING HIM TO THE BOMBINGS IN CHELSEA BUT NOT\nELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY. WE DON'T KNOW QUITE WHY.\nWE DON'T KNOW QUITE WHY WE'RE STILL INVESTIGATING THAT AND OF\nCOURSE IF WE GET ANY NEW INFORMATION ON THAT WE'LL PASS\nIT ALONG TO YOU. ALL RIGHT STILL TO COME, WE ARE\nLEARNING MORE ABOUT THE MAN WHO STAND NINE PEOPLE AT THAT\nMINNESOTA MALL AND ALSO ABOUT THE MAN WHO HEROICALLY STOPPED\nHIM.   EVERYONE THOUGHT I WAS\n  CRAZY TO OPEN A HOTEL HERE.",

BUT WE HAVE TO ADD THIS, THAT\nAUTHORITIES BELIEVE THAT THIS SITUATION WOULD HAVE BEEN SO\nMUCH WORSE IF IT WASN'T FOR A HERO THAT WAS ON SITE.\nA POLICE OFFICER THAT THEY ARE IDENTIFYING AS JASON FALCONER\nFROM A NEARBY TOWN WHO WAS AT THE MALL WHO RESPONDED QUICKLY.\nACCORDING TO SURVEILLANCE VIDEO, OFFICIALS SAY AFTER WATCHING THE\nSURVEILLANCE VIDEO SAY HE REACTED VERY QUICKLY, EVEN WHEN\nTHE ATTACKER WAS LUNGING AT HIM. HE WENT AHEAD AND TOOK OUT HIS\nWEAPON, FIRED A SHOT AND KILLED THE SUSPECT.\nCAROL? >> ALL RIGHT, ROSA FLORES\nREPORTING LIVE FROM ST. CLOUD, MINNESOTA, THIS MORNING.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH. I WANT TO BRING BACK IN MY\nPANEL, WITH ME KAREN GREENBERG, DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER OF\nNATIONAL SECURITY AT FORDHAM UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL AND A\nTERRORIST ANALYST. A LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINER AND\nFORMER NYPD SERGEANT. WELCOME BACK.\nSO, KAREN, I WANT TO START WITH YOU AND THIS YOUNG MAN IN\nMINNESOTA. WE DON'T KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT\nHIM, BUT THE SOMALI COMMUNITY IN MINNESOTA KNOWS OF THE FAMILY,\nTHE FAMILY IS WELL-KNOWN. >> YEAH.\nI MEAN, THIS IS THE FIRST ATTACK IN THE UNITED STATES THAT A\nSOMALI-AMERICAN HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN.\nTHERE WAS A PLOT YEARS AGO BUT THIS IS THE FIRST ONE.\nSO I THINK THAT IS ALSO A THRESHHOLD.\nTHE SOMALI-AMERICAN COMMUNITY THAT HAS BEEN ATTRACTED TO ISIS\nHAS LARGELY WANTED TO GO ABROAD TO FIGHT EITHER WITH AL-SHABAAB\nOR IN SYRIA. BUT LET MEL THE YOU IN TERMS OF\nWHO THE INDIVIDUALS ARE COMPARED TO THE 110 CASES OF ISIS\nINDIVIDUALS IN THE UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW OVER THE PAST TWO\nYEARS. MOST OF THEM ARE 20, FOR THE\nMOST PART, WHEN APPREHENDED AND ARRESTED.\nBUT THOSE WHO CARRY OUT ATTACKS TEND TO BE OLDER LIKE THE\nINDIVIDUAL THEY ARE LOOKING FOR IN THE NEW YORK AREA RIGHT NOW.\nTHEY TEND TO BE IN THEIR LATE 20s.\nALSO, THE SAN BERNARDINO ATTACK, THE ORLANDO ATTACK, A NUMBER OF\nTHE SERIOUS THREATS TO NEW YORK CITY WERE FROM PEOPLE WHOSE\nBACKGROUND WAS IN AFGHANISTAN. SO THAT REALLY BRINGS IN THE\nLARGER PICTURE OF WHAT ACTUALLY ARE THE DISLOCATING ELEMENTS\nHERE. AND FINALLY, THERE IS OFTEN SOME\nPERSONAL TRAUMA THAT PROCEEDS THESE ATTACKS.\nWHO KNOWS WHAT IT WILL BE. WE HEAR THAT THE INDIVIDUAL\nTHERE IS LOOKING FOR AND WAS IN NEW JERSEY.\n>> THE THING IS WITH THE ATTACK IN MINNESOTA, ISIS CLAIMED\nRESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT. >> ISIS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY\nAFTER THEY HEARD THAT THE NAME OF THE PERSON WAS MUSLIM.\nWHO KNOWS WHAT MEANS FOR THE CALL TO RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT.\nWE DON'T KNOW. AND THEY MAY CLAIM\nRESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS. >> BUT THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY\nMEAN THAT THEY ORDERED IT FROM THESE OTHER COUNTRIES.\n>> OF COURSE NOT. WE HAVE NOT FOUND WITH THE\nEXCEPTION OF SOME INTERNET CASES THAT HAVE CALLED FOR THINGS OVER\nTHE INTERNET THAT HASN'T BEEN REALIZED.\nWE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT KIND OF CONNECTION AS I SEE BEFORE WITH\nAL QAEDA. WHAT IT MEANS TO BE INSPIRED BY\nISIS IN MORE WAYS IS UNSETTLING. IF YOU ARE REALLY FEELING THAT\nYOU'RE MISTREATED AND AREN'T AS SUCCESSFUL AS OTHER INDIVIDUALS,\nHERE'S WHAT YOU CAN DO ANYWHERE ANY TIME.\nBUT IS THAT A DIRECT MISSION OR DIRECT MESSAGE?\nI DON'T THINK SO. >> SO JOE, WE ARE SEPARATING OUT\nTHE MINNESOTA ATTACK BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT CONNECTING THAT TO\nTHE BOMBINGS HERE ON THE EAST COAST, RIGHT?\nSO WHY -- IS IT REALLY A TERROR CELL OR IS IT THESE GROUPS OF\nDISENFRANCHISED YOUNG MEN GETTING TOGETHER TO CAUSE\nTROUBLE? >> WELL, APPARENTLY IT SEEMS TO\nBE GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE HAD A HATRED FOR THE UNITED\nSTATES, A HATRED FOR OUR WAY OF LIFE, AND THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE\nIT TO US WITH THE BOMBS AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF DEVICES THEY\nARE GOING TO USE. I MEAN, WE USED A KNIFE IN THE\nMINNESOTA AREA, THE PRESSURE COOKERS HERE.\nNO GUNS INVOLVED IN THIS, WHICH IS UNUSUAL WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK\nAT IT, BUT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS A TOUGH JOB AHEAD OF IT.\nBECAUSE WE WANT TO GAIN THE VENLS BUT WE HAVE TO DO IT\nWITHIN THE BOUND RIS OF THE CONSTITUTION.\nAND THIS IS WHERE THAT WHOLE SHARE IS THAT WE HAVE A PROBLEM\nWITH. IT IS DIFFICULT TO INVOKE\nTERRORISM BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO I THINK FRINGE RIGHTS AND THAT IS\nWHAT THE PROBLEM IS. >> PUT THIS INTO PERSPECTIVE, IT\nCAUSES ONE TO FREAK OUT TO KNOW THERE WAS AN ATTACK IN\nMINNESOTA, RIGHT? THERE WAS AN ATTACK IN SEASIDE,\nNEW JERSEY. THERE WERE BOMBS FOUND IN\nELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY, AND THEN IN CHELSEA THE TWO PRESSURE\nCOOKER BOMBS. SO IS IT THIS WAVE OF TERRORISM\nROLLING OVER THE COUNTRY. LIKE PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE FOR\nME. IT'S THE WEEK OF 9/11.\nTHIS IS THE WEEK AFTER 9/11 THAT THE ATTACKS OCCURRED IN.\nIF THERE WAS A SENSE OF LET'S DO SOMETHING TO DESTABILIZE PEOPLE,\nTHAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD PICK. TO SEE A WAVE OF TERRORISM AS WE\nHAVE IN THE PAST WOULD BE WITH EXPANDING THAT.\nPEOPLE DID NOT DIE IN NEWS ATTACKS.\nTHE ABILITY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS TO CARRY OUT ATTACKS IN A\nSOPHISTICATED, EFFECTIVE, COORDINATED WAY HAS BEEN\nMINIMIZED. THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE LAW\nENFORCEMENT EFFORTS THAT HAVE VAST.\nAND IT'S ADEPT AT UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE THREAT IS.\nBUT IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF SIMILARITIES ISSUE.\nI THINK THAT IT IS MORPHING. THE MAY NOT BE USING THE WORD\nTERRORIST FOR THIS DOWN THE ROAD.\n>> I HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR STICKING\nAROUND. I DO APPRECIATE IT.\nTHANK YOU FOR JOINING ME. I'M CAROL COSTELLO.\nWE'LL BE BACK AFTER A BREAK.",

HE WAS IN THE MALL, ACCORDING TO\nMATE OR, BECAUSE HE WAS GOING TO BUY A TOY FOR HIS CHILD.\nHIS CHILD WAS ABOUT TO HAVE HIS BIRTHDAY.\nHE ENDED UP SAVING A LOT OF LIVES, AND HE IS BEING HAILED,\nAS YOU SAID, A HERO HERE IN ST.

HE RUSHED TO THE SCENE AND\nSTOPPED THIS YOUNG MAN FROM POSSIBLY SLAUGHTERING MORE\nPEOPLE, ATTACKING MORE PEOPLE. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT JASON\nFALCONER? >> I DIDN'T KNOW JASON FALCONER\nPRIOR TO SATURDAY. I CAN TELL YOU THAT I'VE HAD\nOCCASION TO SPEAK WITH HIM TWO TIMES AND WE'RE GLAD THAT HE WAS\nIN THE PLACE THAT HE WAS AT THE TIME THAT HE WAS.\nTHE MAYOR AND I VIEWED THE SURVEILLANCE VIDEO FROM INSIDE\nTHE STORE AND IT'S -- IT'S MORE THAN UNNERVING.\nIT'S CLEAR WHAT THE ATTACKER'S INTENT WAS WITH RESPECT TO THE\nINNOCENT PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, THAT WERE BEING ATTACKED.\nAND BUT FOR OFFICER FALCONER'S ACTIONS, THIS COULD HAVE BEEN\nEXPONENTIALLY WORSE, AND SO IF THERE'S ANY -- ANY GOOD NEWS\nFROM THIS HORRIBLE SITUATION, IT'S THAT NO INNOCENT PEOPLE\nWERE KILLED, AND AS OF TODAY, ALL OF THEM HAVE BEEN RELEASED\nFROM THE HOSPITAL.

              "text": ">>> THIS IS CNN BREAKING NEWS.\n>> WELCOME BACK TO OUR VIEWERS HERE IN THE UNITED STATES AND\nAROUND THE WORLD. WE CONTINUE FOLLOWING THE\nBREAKING NEWS OUT OF NEW YORK. I'M GEORGE HOWELL.\nTHE FBI SAYS THAT ITS AGENTS AND POLICE MADE A TRAFFIC STOP\nSUNDAY NIGHT IN THAT BOMBING INVESTIGATION IN THE CHELSEA\nNEIGHBORHOOD. NO ONE HAS BEEN ARRESTED OR\nCHARGED, THOUGH, AS OF THIS POINT.\nALSO, INVESTIGATORS SAY THEY ARE LOOKING FOR A MAN THAT WAS SEEN\nIN SURVEILLANCE VIDEO AT THE SITE OF SATURDAY'S EXPLOSION AND\nNEAR WHERE POLICE FOUND THIS, A PRESSURE COOKER THAT WAS\nDISCOVERED JUST FOUR BLOCKS AWAY.\nWE'RE ALSO MONITORING NEWS OF A SUSPICIOUS PACKAGE THAT WAS\nFOUND IN ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY. THAT IS WHERE RACHEL CRANE IS\nLIVE AND JOINS US WITH THE VERY LATEST.\nRA RACHEL, WHAT MORE DO YOU KNOW?\n>> WELL, GEORGE, I JUST SPOKE WITH THE MAYOR OF ELIZABETH WHO\nDESCRIBED WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE THIS EVENING.\nHE SAID THAT TWO MEN FOUND A BACKPACK IN A TRASH CAN CLOSE TO\nTHE TRAIN STATION HERE. THEY LOOKED INSIDE THAT BACKPACK\nTHINKING THEY WERE GOING TO FIND SOMETHING PERHAPS VALUABLE.\nTHAT'S WHEN THEY SAW SOMETHING SUSPICIOUS.\nWHAT HE DESCRIBED AS MULTIPLE DEVICES.\nTHEY THEN DROPPED THE BACKPACK, WENT AROUND THE CORNER TO A\nNEARBY POLICE STATION WHERE THEY NOTIFIED THE AUTHORITIES OF WHAT\nTHEY HAD FOUND. THAT'S WHEN THE POLICE WENT TO\nTHE BACKPACK, AGREED THERE WAS SOMETHING SUSPICIOUS IN THERE.\nAND NOW THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES RESPONDED AS WELL AS THE FBI.\nTHE MAYOR ALSO TOLD US THAT THEY WERE UP TO FIVE DEVICES FOUND IN\nTHAT BACKPACK. HE SAID THAT THERE WAS NO TIMER\nON THOSE DEVICES, NO CELL PHONE ON THOSE DEVICES.\nHE ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THIS IS THE PERFECT EXAMPLE OF IF YOU\nSEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING. BECAUSE IT IS BECAUSE OF THOSE\nTWO INDIVIDUALS FINDING THIS BACKPACK, GOING TO THE POLICE\nTHAT THEY WERE ABLE TO RESPOND. NOW HE ALSO POINTED OUT THAT ONE\nOF THOSE DEVICES IN THAT BACKPACK WAS DETONATED.\nHE SAID THAT WAS BY ACCIDENT. ONE OF THE ROBOTS WAS TRYING TO\nCUT ONE OF THE WIRES AND THAT'S WHEN ONE OF THE DEVICES WENT\nOFF. ALL THE STREETS AND THE\nSURROUNDING AREA HAVE BEEN CLOSED DOWN.\nTHE NORTHEAST CORRIDOR HAS BEEN CLOSED DOWN BETWEEN NEWARK\nLIBERTY AIRPORT AS WELL AS HERE IN ELIZABETH.\nUNCLEAR OF WHEN THAT SERVICE WILL BE RESTORED.\nGEORGE? >> RACHEL, IS THERE A SENSE\nGIVEN WHAT HAPPENED? IS THERE A SENSE THAT THERE\nCOULD BE FURTHER INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS\nANYTHING ELSE OUT THERE TO DISCOVER?\n>> WELL, GEORGE, OF COURSE NEW YORK AND THE SURROUNDING AREA\nAND HERE IN NEW JERSEY, EVERYBODY IS ON THE HEIGHTEN\nALERT BECAUSE OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED RECENTLY.\nIT'S TOO EARLY TO SPECULATE WHETHER OR NOT THIS INCIDENT\nHERE IN ELIZABETH IS CONNECTED TO ANY OF THE OTHER INCIDENTS IN\nSEASIDE AND ALSO IN NEW YORK CITY.\n>> RACHEL, GIVE US A SENSE ALSO. THIS HAS BEEN A BUSY NIGHT FOR\nSURE. WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD FROM PEOPLE\nIF YOU HAD A CHANCE TO TALK TO PEOPLE, GIVEN THE NEW NEWS THAT\nYOU DISCOVERED THERE. PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THAT\nNEIGHBORHOOD, THE SENSE THAT THEY'RE FEELING?\n>> YOU KNOW, GEORGE, GEORGE, WE JUST GOT HERE MOMENTS AGO.\nTHE FIRST THING WE DID IS SPEAK TO THE MAYOR.\nHE DID SAY THAT IT'S SUNDAY EVENING.\nTHAT THIS HAS BEEN A RELATIVELY QUIET NIGHT.\nTHAT TRASH CAN WHERE THE BACKPACK WAS LOCATED, HE POINTED\nOUT IS CLOSE TO A LOCAL PUB. BUT HE SAID THAT IT'S NOT\nHEAVILY TRAFFICKED THIS EVENING BECAUSE IT IS LATE ON A SUNDAY\nNIGHT. SO AS I POINTED OUT, WE'VE ONLY\nHAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK WITH THE MAYOR AT THIS POINT.\nBUT HE DID SAY THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT NO MAYOR WANTS TO\nHAVE TO DEAL WITH, THAT THIS IS OBVIOUSLY VERY TRYING TIMES.\nAND THAT THE CITY OF ELIZABETH IS ON ALERT.\nHE ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THEY DID A SECONDARY SEARCH OF THE\nSURROUNDING AREA TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WERE NO OTHER\nADDITIONAL DEVICES. AND HE SAID THAT THAT SWEEP\nTURNED OUT NEGATIVE. AND THAT IT HAS BEEN FULFILLED.\nTHAT THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE SUSPICIOUS OTHER THAN THIS\nBACKPACK WITH MULTIPLE DEVICE, UP TO FIVE DEVICE, GEORGE.\n>> RACHEL, WE KNOW YOU AND YOUR TEAM HAVE BEEN MOVING QUICKLY TO\nGET THIS INFORMATION AND TO GET TO IT AIR WITH US.\nWE APPRECIATE THAT. WE ALSO WANT TO ASK BEFORE WE\nLEAVE YOU HERE, WE WANT TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR TO OUR VIEWERS,\nTHAT THIS SITUATION HERE, THERE IS NO CONNECTION TO THE\nSITUATION IN NEW YORK, CORRECT? >> NO, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO\nCONNECTION BETWEEN THIS INCIDENT HERE IN ELIZABETH AND THE\nINCIDENT THAT WE SAW YESTERDAY IN NEW YORK CITY.\nIT IS FAR TOO EARLY IN THIS INVESTIGATION TO BEGIN TO\nSPECULATE ABOUT THAT. RIGHT NOW WE ARE JUST DEALING\nWITH THE SITUATION HERE IN ELIZABETH.\nAND ONCE AGAIN, FAR TOO EARLY IN THIS INVESTIGATION TO SPECULATE\nOF ANY CONNECTIONS. GEORGE?\n>> YOU'RE REPORTING VERY PRECISE THERE.\nIF YOU SEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING.\nTHAT BRINGING SOME NEW INFORMATION HERE FOR THESE\nINVESTIGATORS TONIGHT. RACHEL CRANE ON THE SPOT THERE\nIN ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR\nREPORTING. AND WE'LL STAY IN TOUCH WITH\nYOU. THIS IS CNN BREAKING NEWS\nCOVERAGE. WE WILL CONTINUE WITH MORE ON\nTHE INVESTIGATION THAT WE'RE LEARNING FROM NEW YORK.\nA TRAFFIC STOP CONNECTED TO THE BOMBING IN CHELSEA IN LOWER\nMANHATTAN. STAY WITH US.",

THE LATEST ON THE INVESTIGATION\nAFTER THE BOMBING THE NEW YORK SATURDAY NIGHT.\n>> HELLO EVERYONE, I'M GNAT HE ALLEN LIVE IN ATLANTA.\nWE'RE GETTING MORE INFORMATION. THE FBI SAID IT MADE A TRAFFIC\nSTOP WITH POLICE ON SUNDAY OF A VEHICLE OF INTEREST IN THE CASE.\nAS OF NOW WE'RE TOLD THERE ARE NO ARRESTS, NO CHARGES AND THE\nINVESTIGATION IS ON GOING. >> THERE MAY BE ANOTHER CLUE AS\nWELL TO TALK ABOUT. INVESTIGATORS TELLING CNN THAT A\nMAN WAS SEEN IN SURVEILLANCE VIDEO AT THE SIGHT OF THAT\nEXPLOSION. >> AND NEAR WHERE POLICE FOUND A\nPRESSURE COOKER FOUR BLOCKS AWAY.\nIT WAS RIGGED WITH WIRES AND DUCT TAPE AND WHAT APPEARED TO\nBE A CELL PHONE. IT DID NOT EXPLODE AND THEY TOOK\nIT APART. WE'RE ALSO FOLLOWING A SEPARATE\nDEVELOPMENT NOW IN NEW JERSEY. POLICE DETONATED THIS RIGHT\nHERE, IT'S STILL NEW YORK CITY BUT WE'LL GET TO THE NEW JERSEY\nVIDEO IN A MOLT. DETONATED A SUSPICIOUS DEVICE\nFOUND IN A WASTE PASS KET. IT WAS ONE OF UP TO FIVE DEVICES\nDISCOVERED IN A BACKPACK AND THE MEN THAT FOUND IT SAW WIRES AND\nA PIPE AND CONTACTED AUTHORITIES.\nTHE STATE POLICE ARE INVESTIGATING AND I BELIEVE THEY\nWERE FOUND NEAR A TRAIN STATION? >> NEAR A TRAIN STATION AND\nTRAIN SERVICE HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE.\nIT'S THAT OLD SAYING SEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING.\n>> THEY'RE ALERT RIGHT NOW. INVESTIGATORS THEY ARE ON HIGH\nALERT LOOKING FOR ANYTHING AND CERTAINLY OUR CORR ADDRESS\nSPONTANEOUS DENS WE ARE OUT IN FULL FORCE.\nFOLLOWING THE DEVELOPMENTS IN NEW YORK.\nALSO RACHEL CRANE IS IN ELIZABETH NEW JERSEY WITH MORE\nON THAT SUSPICIOUS PACKAGE THAT WAS FOUND.\nLET'S GO TO RACHEL FIRST. >> WELL, GEORGE, WE'RE HERE IN\nHE ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY. WE JUST SPOKE TO THE MAYOR ABOUT\nTHIS ON GOING SITUATION. HE DESCRIBED WHAT HAPPENED HERE\nTHIS EVENING. HE SAID THAT TWO GENTLEMEN SAW A\nBACKPACK IN A TRASH CAN VERY CLOSE TO A LOCAL PUB AND ALSO\nVERY CLOSE TO THE TRAIN STATION HERE.\nTHEY OPENED THE BACKPACK THINKING THEY WOULD FIND\nSOMETHING VALUABLE AND INSTEAD THEY FOUND A VERY SUSPICIOUS\nLOOKING DEVICE WITH WIRES COMING OUT OF IT.\nTHAT'S WHEN THEY DROPPED THAT BACKPACK AND WENT AROUND THE\nCORNER TO THE LOCAL POLICE STATION.\nTHE LOCAL AUTHORITIES RESPONDED AND THAT'S WHEN THEY ALSO\nCONFIRMED THAT PACKAGE WAS SUSPICIOUS LOOKING.\nAS YOU CAN SEE THIS WAS OBVIOUSLY STILL AN ON GOING\nSITUATION. THAT'S WHEN THEY ALSO THEN THE\nLOCAL AUTHORITIES CALLED IN THE BOMB SQUAD AS WELL AS THE FBI.\nNOW THE MAYOR ALSO TOLD US THAT THAT BACKPACK, THE DEVICES\nINSIDE UP TO FIVE DEVICES BUT ALSO DESCRIBED TO US WHEN ONE OF\nTHE ROBOTS ACCIDENTALLY DETONATED ONE.\nTAKE A LISTEN. >> THE ROBOTS THAT WERE GOING IN\nTO DISARL IT CUT A WIRE AND IT EXPLODED.\nAND I KNOW THERE'S OTHER DEVICES.\nI DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR MADE UP OF BUT THEY'LL HAVE TO BE\nREMOVED. ALL THE FRAGMENTS IN THE OTHER\nPIECE HAVE TO BE PICKED UP SO THE FBI CAN INVESTIGATE THIS\nFULLY. >> THEY WENT ON TO SAY THERE'S\nNO TIMER AND NO CELL PHONE CONNECTED TO THOSE DEVICES.\nNOW THE AREA HERE, THE STREETS HAVE ALL BEEN CLOSED DOWN.\nTRAIN SERVICE HAS BEEN SUSPENDED BETWEEN NEW YORK HIBERTY AIRPORT\nAND ELIZABETH NEW JERSEY. UNCLEAR WHEN IT WILL BE RESTORED\nBUT CERTAINLY EVERYBODY HERE IN HE ELIZABETH NEW JERSEY, ALL THE\nLOCAL AUTHORITIES RESPONDING TO THE SITUATION AND ON HEIGHTENED\nALERT. >> YEAH AND IT'S ABOUT TO BE A\nMONDAY MORNING COMMUTER TIME SO THIS IS ANOTHER DISRUPTION.\nHOW FAR IS ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY FROM MANHATTAN?\n>> IT TOOK US ABOUT 30 MINUTES TO GET HERE NATALIE THIS\nEVENING. THAT OBVIOUSLY WITH NO TRAFFIC.\nSO IT'S NOT TOO FAR BUT IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT A STONE'S THROW\nAWAY. >> OKAY.\nRACHEL CRANE FOR US THERE. OBVIOUSLY VERY ACTIVE SCENE AT\nTHE INVESTIGATION WITH THE FIRE TRUCK GOING RIGHT PAST HER AS\nSHE SPOKE. >> ALSO IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT\nTHAT SITUATION IN NEW JERSEY NOT BEING CONNECTED AT THIS POINT TO\nTHE SITUATION IN MANHATTAN AND THAT'S WHERE WE WANT TO GO NOW\nLIVE TO DEBORAH FOLLOWING THE INVESTIGATION IN NEW YORK.\nDEBORAH, SO, YOU KNOW, TALK TO US, IF YOU COULD ABOUT THE\nLATEST, WE UNDERSTAND THIS TRAFFIC STOP WAS MADE ON A\nBRIDGE THAT HAS BEEN CONNECTED TO THE BOMBING INCIDENT.\nTHE EXPLOSION. >> WELL THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.\nIT'S UNCLEAR WHAT SPECIFICALLY LEAD INVESTIGATORS BOTH FROM THE\nFBI AND THE NYPD TO MAKE THIS PARTICULAR TRAFFIC STOP BUT THEY\nWERE STOPPED ON THE BRIDGE AND THAT BRIDGE CONNECTS STATEN\nISLAND WITH BROOKLYN BUT IF YOU GO IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION YOU\nCAN GET TO NEW JERSEY. SO THERE'S LINKS BETWEEN THE\nDIFFERENT AREAS WHERE THESE DEVICES SEEM TO BE SHOWING UP\nAND YOU GOT LAW ENFORCEMENT, HUNDREDS OF MEN AND WOMEN WHO\nARE REALLY THINKING ABOUT WHAT THESE DEVICES ARE AND HOW THEY\nCOULD POTENTIALLY BE CONNECTED AND THIS IS ALL PUT OF THE\nINVESTIGATION. WE CAN TELL YOU YOURS IS IN\nTOTALITY. YOU HAD THREE DEVICES FOUND\nYESTERDAY, SATURDAY. TWO IN MANHATTAN.\nONE IN NEW JERSEY. ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF FROM\nTHE LOCATION OF THE OTHER DEVICES BUT NOW YOU GOT THESE IN\nELIZABETH NEW JERSEY AND JUST TO PUT IT IN CONTEXT, HE LIZ PELTH,\nNEW JERSEY IS ABOUT FIVE MILES FROM NEWARK AIRPORT AND THAT'S\nWHY YOU HAVE THAT STRETCH FROM ELIZABETH TO NEWARK CLOSE DOWN\nRIGHT NOW BUT THEY'RE LOOKING AT ALL OF THIS TO SEE WHETHER\nTHERE'S SIMILARITIES IN THE DEVICES.\nWE DO KNOW THE DEVICES APPEAR TO HAVE HAD A CELL PHONE ATTACHED\nTO THEM. BUT THE ONES IN NEW JERSEY WERE\nONLY ONE OF THE THREE PIPE BOMBS DETONATED YESTERDAY.\nAND THESE ARE THE COMMONALITIES AND IT HAPPENS TO MAKE A GREAT\nCONSEQUENCE AND I SPOKE TO A SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL\nEARLIER TODAY. WHEN YOU HAVE THESE YOU HAVE TO\nLOOK MORE DEEPLY BECAUSE IT DOESN'T USUALLY BREAK THAT WAY.\n>> WE'RE SEEING THIS CAR THAT THEY WERE INVESTIGATING AND I\nKNOW YOU WERE STANDING THERE EARLIER REPORTING ON WHAT WAS\nGOING ON. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT.\n>> THERE'S THE FACT THAT THIS CAR HAD NEW JERSEY LICENSE\nPLATES. YESTERDAY IN NEW JERSEY THE\nQUESTION WAS COULD THAT BE CONNECTED?\nAND WHY IS IT IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA OF WHERE THESE DEVICES\nFOUND IN MANHATTAN. IT COULD ALSO BE THAT THIS CAR\nHAS SHRAPNEL IN IT. CLEARLY THERE'S EVIDENCE.\nYOU CAN SEE THERE WAS A WOMAN THERE TAKING A LOT OF\nPHOTOGRAPHS AND WORKING AT DIFFERENT MARKS AND THINGS IN\nTHE CAR AND TOOK IT AWAY FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS.\nSO THAT WAS A PARTICULAR INTEREST.\nTHE FACT THAT IT WAS PARKED ON 23rd STREET JUST A BLOCK FROM\nWHERE THAT DEVICE DETONATED THAT IS ALSO OF INTEREST.\nHOW IT ENDED UP THERE. SO INVESTIGATORS NOW ARE GETTING\nENOUGH CLUES AND ENOUGH DETAILS THAT THEY CAN BEGIN TO SORT OF\nSPIDER OUT FROM THERE AND LOOK AT HOW THE THREADS CONNECT.\n>> AND THEY HAVE THAT VIDEO SURVEILLANCE AS WELL.\nIT'S CERTAINLY ON GOING. >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR REPORTING.\nRACHEL CRANE ON THE SCENE IN ELIZABETH NEW JERSEY.\nWE'LL STAY IN TOUCH WITH YOU BOTH.\n>> JUST BEFORE THAT EXPLOSION WENT OFF AT NEW YORK STABBINGS\nAT A SHOPPING MALL IN STFLT CLOUD, MINNESOTA.\nWOUNDED AT LEAST 9 PEOPLE. ONE CRITICALLY.\nTHE FBI IS INVESTIGATING THAT INCIDENT AS A POTENTIAL ACT OF\nTERROR. ONE WITNESS THAT WORKED AT THE\nMALL DESCRIBED WHAT SHE SAW. LISTEN.\n>> ALL OF A SUDDEN CHAOS JUST BROKE OUT.\nTHERE IS A BUNCH OF PEOPLE RUNNING INTO THE JCPENNEY MALL\nENTRANCE AND THEY WERE JUST SCREAMING THAT SOMEONE WAS GOING\nAROUND THE MALL STABBING PEOPLE AND THAT THERE WAS BLOOD\nEVERYWHERE. AND IT WAS JUST HONESTLY A\nREALLY SCARY THING AND TROPICAL WAVED EVERYTHING AND BOOKED IT\nBACK TO MY CO-WORKER TO NOTIFY HER WHAT WAS GOING ON.\nI RAN OUT A DIFFERENT EXIT OUT OF OUR JCPENNEYS THAT LEAD\nSTRAIGHT TO THE PARKING LOT AND I JUMPED INTO MY CAR AND RAN OFF\nAS FAST AS I COULD. >> THAT HAD TO BE TERRIFYING.\nPOLICE SAY THE ATTACKER APPEARS TO HAVE ACTED ALONE.\nTHE CITY'S MAYOR PRAISED THE OFF DUTY POLICE OFFICER THAT SHOT\nAND KILLED THE ATTACKER. >> HE CLEARLY PREVENTED\nADDITIONAL INJURIES AND LOSS OF LIFE.\nHIS HEROIC ACTIONS OR HAVING WITNESSED WHAT HE DID AND THE\nSUSPECT IS LUNGING WITH HIM AND NOT ONLY DID HE FIRE BUT THE\nSUSPECT WENT DOWN AND CAME BACK UP ON THREE DIFFERENT OCCASIONS.\n>> SO IF YOU'RE COUNTING THERE'S A SITUATION THERE IN MINNESOTA.\nTWO SITUATIONS IN NEW JERSEY. AND WE'RE DISCOVERING TONIGHT\nAND ALSO CERTAINLY NEW YORK. FRONT AND CENTER.\nTHERE WAS NO CLEAR LINK BETWEEN ALL THE ATTACKS THROUGHOUT THE\nU.S. IT'S THE TIMING RAISING A LOT OF\nCONCERN. >> WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE TIMING\nTHAT IS INTERESTING TO YOU? >> FIRST OF ALL IT'S ALL\nHAPPENING SO FAST. ALL WITHIN THE PERIOD OF 24\nHOURS THIS IS ALL TAKING PLACE AND ORDINARILY I WOULD PUT THE\nTIMING TO OCTOBER AND OCTOBER WAS ALWAYS THE MONTH WHERE WE\nWERE NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE AS MUCH LOCATION.\nTIME OFF WAS LIMITED AND YOU COULDN'T SCHEDULE THINGS BECAUSE\nOF THE GENERAL IS SEMIBLI. AND MOVING ALL AROUND THE CITY\nSO YOU HAVE EXTRA SECURITY FROM THOSE COUNTRIES COMING IN.\nYOU HAVE EXTRA SECRET SERVICE. A STATE DEPARTMENT DIPLOMATIC\nSECURITY AND IT WAS A HUGE COORDINATION EFFORT AND THEN\nWHEN YOU HAVE THESE THINGS TAKING PLACE AT THE SAME TIME\nTHAT JUST HEIGHTENED EVERYBODY'S AWARENESS.\n>> I'D LIKE TO GET YOUR SENSE OF THINGS SO I'M SURE YOU HEARD OUR\nCORRESPONDENT REPORTING THERE AND WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?\n>> I'M SURE THAT THERE ARE ALL OF THESE INCIDENCES PROPERLY\nBEING WORKED CLOSELY TOGETHER. AND IT'S PROBABLY IN CONSTANT\nCONTACT WITH THE JTTF IN NEW YORK AND THEY'RE PROBABLY\nTRADING IN NEW YORK. ALL OF THEM WILL GO QUICKLY TO\nBE EXAMINED IF FOR COMMONALITIES AND THEY'LL KNOW IT AS QUICKLY\nAS THEY CAN GET IT DOWN THERE. NOBODY WILL REST.\nEVERYBODY WILL BE WORKING ON THIS THING CONSTANTLY BUT AS\nIT'S MOVING FORWARD MORE INCIDENTS KEEP HAPPENING AS WE\nSPEAK SO IT'S GOING TO BE A BUSY TIME.\n>> CERTAINLY AND THE PRESSURE IS ON TO TRY TO BRING THIS TO A\nCONCLUSION. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE FACT\nTHAT THEY HAVE SURVEILLANCE VIDEO.\nTHEY HAVE SOMEONE SUSPICIOUS IN THE VIDEO BUT THEY'RE NOT\nRELEASING IT TO THE PUBLIC FOR ANY HELP.\n>> I THINK THAT MIGHT INDICATE THAT THEY HAVE WHAT THEY FEEL IS\nENOUGH TO PROVIDE THEM WITH WHAT THEY NEED TO IDENTIFY THE PERSON\nSO IN OTHER WORDS YOU ONLY GO OUT TO THE PUBLIC IF YOU NEED TO\nGO OUT TO THE PUBLIC. IF THERE'S ENOUGH IN THAT VIDEO\nFOR THEM TO IDENTIFY THE INDIVIDUAL OR IF THEY CAN TO IT\nIN A LESS PUBLIC WAY, THEY CAN TWO TO CERTAIN PEOPLE THAT THEY\nTHINK MIGHT KNOW THAT INDIVIDUAL THEN THEY CAN DO THAT.\nTHE LESS YOU CAN MAKE PUBLIC IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ADDITIONAL\nCO-CONSPIRATORS IT'S DIFFERENT AT THAT POINT.\n>> I WANT TO GET SOME CONTEXT FROM YOU GIVEN YOUR EXPERIENCE\nIN THIS ARENA. THE PRECISION THAT GOES INTO A\nTRAFFIC STOP THAT HAPPENS ON A BRIDGE, TALK TO US ABOUT THAT.\nAND NO ONE HAS OPINION CHARGED WITH ANYTHING BUT WE DO\nUNDERSTAND THIS IS BEING CON NECKED TO THE SITUATION, THAT\nEXPLOSION IN NEW YORK. >> CLEARLY SOMETHING LEAD THEM\nTO THAT VEHICLE AND THEN THEY GOT ON TO THE VEHICLE AND\nTRAFFIC STOPS ARE ALWAYS A DANGEROUS THING FOR ANY POLICE\nOFFICER TO ENGAGE IN. THE BRIDGE MAY HAVE BEEN THE\nPERFECT TIME TO DO IT BECAUSE YOU HAVE MORE CONTROL OVER WHERE\nTHE CAR IS GOING TO GO. THEY MIGHT HAVE COVERAGE AT BOTH\nENDS OF THE BRIDGE. THEY CAN DELAY TRAFFIC IN THE\nAREA EASILY. MORE EASILY ON A BRIDGE.\nSO IT'S A MORE CONTROLLED VIERLT WHEN YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING LIKE\nTHAT AND THE FACT THAT THE NYPD AND THE FBI WERE DOING IT\nTOGETHER JOINTLY ADDS TO THE SAFETY FACTOR FOR THE OFFICERS\nINVOLVED. >> WE APPRECIATE YOU JOINING US\nTO HELP US UNDERSTAND THIS PROCESS.\nTHANK YOU BOBBY. >> BOBBY, THANK YOU.\nYOU'RE WATCHING CNN NEWSROOM. WE CONTINUE FOLLOWING THE BREAK\nNEWS OUT OF NEW YORK AND OUT OF NEW JERSEY BUT OTHER STORIES\nWE'RE FOLLOWING AND AHEAD THIS HOUR, A THRIVING CITY BEFORE\nTHOUSANDS LEFT IT. WE GO INSIDE OF ALEPPO TO SEE\nHOW SYRIANS THAT STAYED BEHIND THERE ARE HANGING ON.\n>> ALSO AHEAD, AN ARMY BASE COMES UNDER ATTACK WITH DEADLY\nCONSEQUENCES. THIS IS A FLASHPOINT REGION AND\nTHERE IS REASON FOR CONCERN THAT IT IS HEATING UP.\nWE'LL BE BACK WITH THAT AS WELL.                                .",

THAT NEIGHBORHOOD PUB DOES HAVE\nA SECURITY CAMERA AND THERE ARE AGENTS AND ELIZABETH POLICE\nREVIEWING THAT SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE FOR THAT EVENING AS WE\nSPEAK. >> NOW, IT'S INTERESTING TO NOTE\nTHAT THIS PUB DOESN'T HAVE MUCH ACTIVITY ON SUNDAYS.\nEVERY DAY OF THE WEEK THE MAYOR TELLS US EXCEPT SUNDAYS, THEY'RE\nVERY BUSY. BUT NOT ON THAT PARTICULAR DAY.\nTHE DEVICE HAS BEEN PUT IN A CONTAINER.\nIT IS STILL LOCAL, BUT TRANSPORTED TO THE FBI.",

LAST NIGHT AT 9:30 TWO MEN WERE\nWALKING BY A TRASH CAN NEAR A PUB CLOSE TO THE TRAIN AND THEY\nSAW A BACKPACK AND THEY TOOK IT OUT AND THOUGHT THERE MIGHT BE\nVALUABLES IN IT. THEY OPENED IT UP AND SAW A PIPE\nAND WIRES. THEY KNEW IT WAS EXTREMELY\nSERIOUS AT THAT POINT AND WENT TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND LOCAL\nAUTHORITIES CALLED IN THE BOMB SQUAD AND FBI AND A ROBOT WENT\nUP TO THAT BACKPACK. THERE WERE MULTIPLE EXPLOSIVE\nDEVICES, BOMBS IN THAT BACKPACK. YOU ARE LOOKING RIGHT THERE AND\nTHE ROBOT INADVERTENTLY CUTS ONE OF THE WIRES AND ONE OF THE\nEXPLOSIVE DEVICES GOES OFF. JUST ONE.\nAT ONE POINT, JUST SEVERAL HOURS AGO, THEY WERE ABLE TO CONTAIN\nIT AND PUT IT IN A PROTECTIVE CONTAINER.\nIT IS SAFE. IT IS LOCALLY STILL HERE.\nAND IT WILL BE SENT TO THE FBI AND QUANTICO, VIRGINIA, FOR\nFORENSIC PROCESSING. BUT ALSO IMPORTANT IN THE LAST\nFEW HOURS, THEY HAVE FOUND NEAR THE PUB WHERE THE TRASH CAN WAS\nSURVEILLANCE VIDEO. THEY HAVE BEEN COMBING THAT\nSURVEILLANCE VIDEO TO SEE WHAT THEY SEE OR WHO THEY SEE AND\nTRASH PICKUP, THE LAST TRASH PICKUP WAS ON SATURDAY AT THAT\nPARTICULAR TRASH CAN, BUT WHO PUT THAT BACKPACK IN THAT TRASH\nCAN IS CRITICAL. CHRIS?\n>> JEAN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. A LOT OF THIS REPORTING IS\nCOMING IN VERY QUICKLY AS INVESTIGATORS ARE GETTING\nCONFIDENT ENOUGH TO RELEASE IT. THE BIG CONCERN RIGHT NOW IS TO\nFIND THE MAN OR WOMAN WHO MADE THE BOMB.\nWHY? BECAUSE THESE BOMBS ARE MADE\nEASILY. THEY'RE MADE EASILY IN LARGE\nNUMBERS AND THEY WERE SO SOMEWHAT RANDOMLY BEING\nDISTRIBUTED. WHAT THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IS\nIF WE DON'T GET EVERYBODY INVOLVED RIGHT AWAY, THEY MADE\nMORE OF THESE BOMBS IN SOME KIND OF PANIC.\n>> DID SEE THAT PERSON IN THE SURVEILLANCE TAPE THAT THEY WANT\nTO FIND. >> RIGHT NOW, LET'S BRING IN THE\nMAYOR OF ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY. WE KNOW YOU'RE VERY BUSY AND A\nLOT OF INFORMATION COMING IN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING\nUS THIS MORNING. WHAT DO YOU WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW?\n>> FIRST OF ALL, I WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT THE AREA IS\nEXTREMELY SAFE. THE CITY OF ELIZABETH IS OPEN\nFOR BUSINESS AND THE SCHOOLS ARE OPEN.\nIT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE GO ABOUT THEIR NORMAL DAY\nTODAY. >> WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE\nRAIDS THAT ARE GOING ON RIGHT NOW?\nTHERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF QUICK ACTIVITY, COORDINATED EFFORTS\nBETWEEN STATE AND FEDERAL. >> THE RESPONSE BY THE ELIZABETH\nPOLICE DEPARTMENT AND UNION COUNTY AND AS WELL AS THE FBI\nAND THE STATE POLICE HAS BEEN SECOND TO NONE.\nCURRENTLY, WE ARE ON LINDEN AVENUE AND ELMORE AVENUE.\nTHE FBI IS EXECUTING A SEARCH WARRANT AND THEY'LL BE THERE FOR\nTHE NEXT FEW HOURS GOING THROUGH THIS LOCATION TO FIND ANY\nEVIDENCE POSSIBLE WHETHER IT'S IN RELATION TO THIS INCIDENT OR\nTHE CHELSEA INCIDENT. WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT THE FBI AND\nTHE CITY OF ELIZABETH AND THE STATE POLICE WILL EXECUTE THAT\nSEARCH WARRANT TO THE BEST OF THEIR ABILITY.\n>> WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO YOU THAT INVESTIGATORS ARE REPORTING TO\nUS THAT THEY BELIEVE THIS MAY BE PART OF A TERROR CELL'S ACTIVITY\nTHAT IS LOCATED SOMEWHERE IN NEW JERSEY.\nTHEY BELIEVE MAYBE IN ELIZABETH. >> WELL, NO MAYOR WANTS TO WAKE\nUP AND FIND OUT THIS NEWS NEVER MIND LAST NIGHT WHEN I WAS OUT\nHERE FOR A FEW HOURS. EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT THE\nENTIRE COUNTRY FACES THESE THREATS AND NO MAYOR IS IMMUNE\nFROM IT. WE SPEND ALL DAY TRYING TO\nPROTECT OUR CITIZENS AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAVE A BETTER WAY\nOF LIFE. WHY THERE ARE FEW PEOPLE IN THIS\nCOUNTRY WHO WOULD LOOK TO DESTROY THAT WAY OF LIFE.\n>> YOU ARE SAYING ELIZABETH IS MESSAGE YOU WANT TO GET OUT TO -\nPEOPLE TO GET LIFE BACK TO NORMAL AND DISRUPT THE TERRORIST\nINTENT HERE OF CHANGING LIFE. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, YOU GOT\nFEDS FLYING AROUND TRYING TO CLOSE DOWN ALL THE POSSIBILITIES\nAND DIFFERENT PLAYERS WHO MIGHT BE THERE.\nWHAT IS THE BALANCE OF CAUTION UNTIL ALL THESE BAD GUYS ARE\nCAUGHT? >> WELL, THE RAILROADS HAVE BEEN\nOPENED. THE AMTRAK AND NEW JERSEY\nTRANSIT HAS OPENED UP THE TRAIN STATION HERE FOR PEOPLE TO GET\nTO AND FROM THEIR JOB. THE SCHOOLS ARE OPEN.\nTHE POLICE ARE DOING THEIR JOB. IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO\nRECOGNIZE THAT THE POLICE HAVE LEADS.\nTHEY'RE GOING TO FOLLOW THOSE LEADS AND THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE\nSURE THAT THE PERPETRATORS ARE CAUGHT.\n>> HAVE INVESTIGATORS BEEN ABLE TO GIVE YOU ANY DEGREE OF\nCONFIDENCE THAT THEY KNOW WHO ARE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE\nRESPONSIBLE FOR THIS? >> THIS IS AN ONGOING\nINVESTIGATION. AS YOU'VE SAID EARLIER, IT\nSTARTED WITH ONE PERSON. IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE.\nTHE POLICE WILL FOLLOW EVERY LEAD THAT THEY POSSIBLY CAN AND\nTHEN THOSE LEADS WILL RESULT IN ARRESTS IN THE FUTURE.\n>> ALL RIGHT, MR. MAYOR, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nAS YOU GET INFORMATION THAT YOU BELIEVE IS IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE\nTO KNOW, PLEASE, YOU KNOW HOW TO BE IN CONTACT WITH US.\nWE'RE HAPPY TO HELP IN THIS SITUATION.\n>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.",

HE SAID THEY, MEANING THE --\nTHEY'RE LOSING GROUND. TAKE A LISTEN AND WE'LL GET YOUR\nREACTION. >> WE ARE WAGING A PUNISHING WAR\nTO DEFEAT ISIS ON THE BATTLEFIELD AND IT'S SHRINKING\nTHEIR SPACE. HOWEVER, THEY ARE LOOKING AS\nOTHER TERRORIST GROUPS ARE, OKAY, WE'RE LOSING OUR GROUND,\nTHEY'RE LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO ENGAGE IN\nTERRORIST ACTS IN CITIES. THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING,\nWHETHER IN EUROPE OR THE UNITED STATES.\nHOW DO YOU STOP THAT? THAT'S NOT PRIMARILY MILITARY.\nIT'S PRIMARILY INTELLJENS AND THE SHARING OF INTELLIGENCE.\n>> WE'RE NOT SURE IF WHAT HAPPENED IS CONNECTED TO ISIS IN\nANY WAY. IT'S A LITTLE ALARMING WHEN HE'S\nSAYING THAT, THAT THEY'RE WINNING ABROAD WHEN WE'VE JUST\nHAD ALL THESE ATTACKS OVER THE WEEKEND.\n>> WHAT SENATOR KAINE IS SAYING, SENATOR KAINE WITH WHOM I SERVED\nON THE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE.\nWE HAVE IN FACT SHRUNK THE AMOUNT OF TERRITORY ISIS HOLDS\nBY 40%. WE'VE MADE PROGRESS IN IRAQ AND\nSYRIA. THE COALITION IS TAKING THE\nFIGHT SUCCESSFULLY TO ISIS ON THE GROUND.\nBECAUSE ISIS RELIES ON ITS POPULARITY, THE MISPERCEPTION\nTHAT THEIR TWISTED GOALS ARE ADVANCING, FOR THEM TO ATTRACT\nRECRUITS, THEY'RE BEING MORE AND MORE AGGRESSIVE IN REACHING OUT\nAND CALLING ON FOLKS WHO THEY DON'T CONTROL OR TRAIN OR\nSUPPORT TO CARRY OUT ATTACKS. THE ATTACK IN MINNESOTA MAY WELL\nHAVE BEEN INSPIRED INDIRECTLY IN SOME WAY BY ISIS.\nTHERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT ANY OF THESE ATTACKS WERE COORDINATED,\nFUNDED OR SUPPORTED BY -- >> LET'S BE CLEAR, THERE'S NO\nEVIDENCE THAT ISIS KNEW WHO HE WAS BEFOREHAND, PROVIDED HIM ANY\nMATERIAL OR SUPPORT. HE MAY HAVE BEEN A TWISTED\nINDIVIDUAL WHO DECIDED TO CARRY OUT A HORRIBLE KNIFE ATTACKS IN\nA MALL. ISIS IS CLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY\nFOR HIM. BUT WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE LONE\nWOLF ATTACKS, EARLIER THIS YEAR, IS THAT JUST BECAUSE SOME SICK\nINDIVIDUALS CARRIES OUT A HORRIBLE ATTACK DOESN'T MEAN\nISIS SUCCESSFULLY REJOINED THEM. WHAT SNOFR KAINE IS SAYING IS\nSHARING INTELLIGENCE WITH ALLIES IS -- WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE\nWHO HASN'T BEEN OVERSEAS OR TRAINED, WHO ISN'T GETTING\nEQUIPMENT. WHO IS JUST A TWISTED INDIVIDUAL\nLOOKING TO CARRY OUT THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL ATTACK.\n>> SURE. AND BECAUSE THE GUY WAS\nRELATIVELY SUCCESS IN MINNEAPOLIS, MINNEAPOLIS ST.\nCLOUD. HE'S GOING TO GLOM ON TO IT AND\nSAY THAT.",

IF WE CALL YOUR NAME AND YOU ARE\nNOT HERE TO ACCEPT, THE EMMY GOES TO THE NEXT NAME ON THE\nLIST. IT'S CALLED THE MAGGIE SMITH\nRULE. AND THIS, IF YOU DON'T KNOW\nMAGGIE SMITH, SHE HAS BEEN NOMINATED FOR THE EMMY NINE\nTIMES, WON THREE TIMES. HOW MANY TIMES DO YOU THINK\nSHE'S SHOWN UP TO GET THE EMMY? NO TIMES.\nTHIS YEAR, SHE HAD A SUNDAY CERAMICS CLASS SHE COULDN'T GET\nOUT OF. >> AND THE EMMY GOES TO MAGGIE\nSMITH, \"DOWNTON ABBEY.\" >> MAGGIE COULDN'T BE HERE\nTONIGHT SO ACCEPTING THE AWARD ON --\n>> NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. WE'RE NOT MAILING THIS TO HER.\nMAGGIE, IF YOU WANT THIS, IT WILL BE IN THE LOST AND FOUND.\n>> TO BREAK IT DOWN FOR US, LET'S BRINGING IN KIM SERAFIN,\nTHE SENIOR EDITOR OF IN TOUCH WEEKLY AND JOINS FROM US\nLOS ANGELES. IT'S ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO HAVE\nYOU WITH US. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHO THE BIG\nWINNERS WERE AND WHO WAS EXPECTED TO TAKE HOME THE MOST\nTROPHIES. >> YEAH, WITH THE EMMYS, WHAT\nHAPPENS EVERY YEAR, THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF REPEAT WINNERS\nDESERVEDLY. BUT THEY SEEM TO REPEAT AND WIN\nAGAIN AND AGAIN. I THINK EVERYONE EXPECTED, FOR\nEXAMPLE, \"GAME OF THRONES\" TO WIN FOR BEST DRAMA SERIES.\nIT DEFINITELY DESERVED TO WIN, ONE OF THE MOST TALKED ABOUT\nSHOWS WITH A VERY PASSIONATE FAN BASE.\nTHIS WAS A VERY GOOD WIN FOR BEST DRAMA AND \"VEEP\" WON FOR\nBEST COMEDY YEAR. THIS IS ANOTHER SHOW THEY HAD A\nREALLY, REALLY GOOD YEAR, A REALLY GOOD SEASON.\nI THINK IN A POLITICAL YEAR, I THINK PEOPLE EXPECTED \"VEEP\"\nWOULD WIN AGAIN. AT LEAST IT'S NOT \"MODERN\nFAMILY\" WINNING FOR I THINK FIVE YEARS IN A ROW.\n\"VEEP\" COULD BECOME THE SHOW THAT WINS OVER AND OVER AGAIN.\nJULIETTE LOUIS-DREYFUS WON FOR \"VEEP\" AGAIN BUT SHE HAD A FAK\nYEAR. AND JEFFREY TAM BORE WON FOR\n\"TRANSPARENT\" AGAIN. SO MUCH SO PEOPLE EXPECTED HIM\nTO WIN, JIMMY KIMMEL GAVE HIM HIS AWARD BEFORE THEY EVEN\nSTARRED PASSING OUT AWARDS, HE GAVE HIM HIS AWARD BECAUSE\nEVERYONE ASSUMED HE WOULD PROBABLY WIN AND HE DID.\n>> YOU WOULD THINK WITH ALL OF THE POLITICAL HEADLINES THAT\nWE'RE COVERING HERE THAT PEOPLE WOULD GET ENOUGH WITH POLITICS\nBUT YEAH, \"VEEP\" DOING PRETTY WELL.\nPEOPLE LIKE THOSE POLITICAL SHOWS ESPECIALLY THAT'S WHAT\nPEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. THERE WERE ALSO SOME SURPRISES\nAND NEW FACES. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THOSE?\n>> YEAH, IT WAS FLEISS TO SEE A FEW NEWCOMERS WIN IS ALWAYS\nGREAT. RAMI MALIK WON FOR \"MR. ROBOT.\"\nPEOPLE EXPECTED HIM TO WIN BECAUSE HE'S GOTTEN SO MUCH\nATTENTION. EVERYONE ASSUMED HE WOULD WIN\nAND YOU DON'T HAVE JON HAMM ANYMORE WHO PEOPLE WERE ALWAYS\nTALKING ABOUT SO A LOT OF PERENNIAL WINNERS WEREN'T THERE.\nHE WON DESERVEDLY FOR MR. ROBOT. TATIANA WON FOR ORPHAN BLACK.\nFOR SO MANY YEARS, SHE WAS NEVER EVEN NOMINATED.\nPEOPLE WOULD SAY WHERE IS TATIANA MASANI.\nSHE PLAYS CLONES. SHE'S GOT A REALLY, REALLY TOUGH\nJOB. THIS MADE SENSE SHE FINALLY WON\nAND IT WAS NICE TO SEE TWO NEW FACES.\nALTHOUGH HER NAME WAS KIND OF MISPRO NOUNSDS WHEN SHE WON.\nHOPEFULLY NOW PEOPLE WILL BECOME MORE FAMILIAR WITH HER.\n>> WHAT ABOUT THE NOMINATION OF TRACEE ELLIS ROSS.\n>> THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT TO SEE HER WIN.\n\"BLACK-ISH\" IS SUCH A POPULAR SHOW.\nTHE SHOW WAS NOMINATED. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT TO SEE\nIT NOMINATED. EVEN JIMMY KIMMEL MADE A COMMENT\nABOUT THE DIVERSITY IN THE EMMY NOMINATIONS AS OPPOSED TO WHAT\nPEOPLE TALKS ABOUT WITH THE OSCARS SO WHITISH.\nYOU REALLY DO SEE A LOT OF DIVERSITY WITH THE EMMYS.\nA LOT OF TV SHOWS REFLECT REAL LIFE.\nSO HOPEFULLY, TRACEE ELLIS ROSS WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO WIN.\nBLACKISH IS ON THE AIR FOR A LONG TIME.\nPEOPLE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEE IT WIN THIS TIME AROUND.\nITS TIME WILL BE COMING FOR SURE.\n>> KIM SERAFIN SENIOR EDITOR FROM \"INTOUCH WEEKLY,\" THANK YOU\nSO MUCH.",

POLICE AND THE FBI APPARENTLY\nMADE A TRAFFIC STOP SUNDAY NIGHT, A SHORT TIME AGO AND\nTHEIR INVESTIGATION OF THIS WEEKEND'S BOMBING ATTACK IN\nMANHATTAN. FIVE PEOPLE WERE PULLED OVER BUT\nAS OF NOW, WE'RE TOLD NO ARRESTS HAVE BEEN MADE.\nNO CHARGES FILED. 29 PEOPLE WERE INJURED IN\nSATURDAY'S EXPLOSION AS A RESULT NEW YORK'S GOVERNOR IS ADDING\n1,000 MORE POLICE AND TROOPS TO PATROL BUS TERMINALS, AIRPORTS\nAND SUBWAY STATIONS.

OUR CNN INVESTIGATIVE PRODUCER\nHAS BEEN WORKING THE SCENE NOW EVER SINCE THE STORY BROKE AND\nYOU'RE STILL TALKING WITH SOURCES.\nWHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THIS TRAFFIC STOP AND WHAT PERHAPS\nWERE THEIR SUSPICIONS? >> WE FIRST LEARNED OF THIS\nMAYBE AROUND AN HOUR OR SO AGO. A LOCAL STATE SENATOR HAD\nTWEETED THAT SOME -- ABOUT FIVE PEOPLE WERE QUESTIONED BY THE\nFBI. THEY WERE TAKEN INTO CUSTODY AND\nTHE FBI, THE ONLY THING THAT WE'RE CONFIRMING AT THIS HOUR IS\nTHAT THEY DID, IN FACT, STOP A CAR.\nTHEY WANTED TO QUESTION, THEY DID PULL THEM OVER AND THEY DID\nQUESTION THEM. WE BELIEVE THEY HAVE BEEN TAKEN\nBACK TO THE FBI OFFICES AND THE FBI STRESSED TO US THAT YES\nWHILE IT IS RELATED TO THE EXPLOSION THAT OCCURRED HERE IN\nMANHATTAN THE MEN HAVE NOT BEEN CHARGED AND NO ONE HAS BEEN\nARRESTED. >> WHILE YOU WERE TALKING WE\nWERE SHOWING VIDEO OF POLICE SURROUNDING A CAR THAT HAD BEEN\nROPED OFF WITH POLICE TAPE. THAT'S NOT THE CAR THEY PULLED\nOVER, RIGHT? THEY'RE INVESTIGATING A CAR THEY\nFOUND PARKED SOMEWHERE IN MANHATTAN.\n>> YEAH. SO ALL DAY LONG THERE'S BEEN\nDIFFERENT CARS THEY HAVE INVESTIGATED.\nSOME OF THE CARS JUST HAPPENED TO BE HIT BY SHRAPNEL.\nAND WE DO NOT HAVE ANY INDICATION BY LAW ENFORCEMENT\nTHAT THE PEOPLE OR THE PERSON BEHIND THE EXPLOSION WAS DRIVING\nA CAR. SO WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE\nRELATIONSHIP IS TO THE CAR AND THE CRIME SCENE.\nAND THEY FELT LIKE THEY NEEDED TO TAKE IT BACK TO EXAMINE IT\nFURTHER BUT BESIDES THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY FURTHER\nINFORMATION. >> DO WE KNOW IF THERE'S STILL\nROADS SHUTDOWN IN THIS AREA? CLOSED OFF?\nWE'RE ABOUT TO HIT A MONDAY HORNG IN NEW YORK CITY.\n>> I THINK WE EXPECT ALL THE ROADS TO BE OPEN BY TOMORROW\nMORNING OR BY THE MORNING I SHOULD SAY.\nTRAFFIC IS SLOWLY BEING REOPENED AND LIFE IS, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE\nTRYING TO SORT OF RESTORE LIFE BACK IN THIS COMMUNITY AND LET\nPEOPLE GET BACK INTO THEIR HOMES AND LIVE THEIR LIVES.\nSORT OF I GUESS RESTORE SOME KIND OF NORMALCY BUT EVERYTHING\nSHOULD BE REOPENED BY TOMORROW. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT LAW\nENFORCEMENT IS GOING TO LEAVE THE AREA.\nTHEY'RE STILL TALKING TO THEM INSIDE THE BUILDING.\nI THINK LAW ENFORCEMENT IS GOING TO REMAIN THERE BUT IT'S A\nQUESTION OF HOW MUCH LONGER BUT I THINK THE STREETS WILL ALL BE\nREOPENED BY TOMORROW. >> ONE OF OUR EXPERTS SAID\nPERHAPS THEY'RE NOT RELEASING THIS VIDEO BECAUSE THEY HAVE\nENOUGH TO GO ON RIGHT NOW.

              "text": "ACT OF TERROR.\n>>> AND THE SHAKY CEASEFIRE. THE UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA TRY\nTO MEND RELATIONS OVER THE WAR IN SYRIA.\nBUT THE QUESTION, WILL IT BE ENOUGH?\nFROM CNN WORLD HEADQUARTERS IN ATLANTA, WELCOME TO OUR VIEWER\nHERE IS IN THE UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE WORLD.\nI'M GEORGE HOWELL. \"CNN NEWSROOM\" STARTS RIGHT NOW.\n>> THIS IS CNN BREAKING NEWS. >> 1:00 A.M. ON THE U.S. EAST\nCOAST. WE CONTINUE FOLLOWING THE\nBREAKING NEWS FROM SATURDAY NIGHT'S BOMBING IN NEW YORK.\nTHE FBI AND NEW YORK POLICE MADE A TRAFFIC STOP SUNDAY NIGHT IN\nTHIS INVESTIGATION. AND WE'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT\nANOTHER SITUATION PLAYING OUT RIGHT NOW IN NEW JERSEY.\nLET'S GO LIVE TO OUR CNN CORRESPONDENT DEBORAH FEYERICK\nFOLLOWING DEVELOPMENTS IN NEW YORK.\nDEBORAH, IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.\nWHAT MORE HAVE YOU LEARNED. >> THERE ARE A COUPLE OF\nINCIDENTS HAPPENING ACROSS BOTH MANHATTAN AND NEW JERSEY.\nWE'RE TOLD NOW THAT THE MAYOR OF ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY TWEETED\nTHAT FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS ARE ON SCENE OF A\nSUSPICIOUS PACKAGE AT A TRAIN STATION IN ELIZABETH, NEW\nJERSEY. RIGHT NOW THEY'RE SAYING THERE\nIS NO THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY AS THE PACKAGE IS SECURED AND ALSO\nINVESTIGATED. ANOTHER INCIDENT ALSO HAPPENING\nNEAR THE NORTHEAST CORRIDOR AND NORTH JERSEY COASTLINE RAIL\nSERVICE. THAT HAS BEEN SUSPENDED BETWEEN\nNEW YORK AND LIBERTY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT AND\nELIZABETH STATIONS BECAUSE POLICE ACTIVITY IN THE ELIZABETH\nAREA. WHENEVER YOU HAVE INCIDENTS LIKE\nWHAT HAPPENED IN NEW YORK CITY AND ALSO IN NEW JERSEY,\nOBVIOUSLY EVERYBODY GETS ON THE HEIGHTENED STATE OF ALERT.\nSO THEY TAKE ALL CALLS SERIOUSLY.\nTHE ISSUE THAT HAPPENED EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON AT A BRIDGE\nCONNECTING STATEN ISLAND AND NEW YORK, THAT THE FBI PUT OUT A\nSTATEMENT SAYING IT WAS CONNECTED TO WHAT HAPPENED IN\nMANHATTAN. BUT THE OTHERS SEEM TO BE\nSEPARATE THERE IS NOTHING LINKING THEM TO ANY OF THE\nINCIDENTS THAT HAPPENED. BUT IT'S ALL VERY EARLY.\nTHIS IS ALL PART OF A LARGER INVESTIGATION.\nAND SO YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF AUTHORITIES PAYING VERY CLOSE\nATTENTION TO ANY POTENTIAL CALL THAT IS MADE.\nBUT THEY'RE ALSO DOING A LOT OF INVESTIGATIVE WORK.\nAND SOME OF THIS INVESTIGATIVE WORK MAY BE LEADING TO TIPS THAT\nARE CAUSING THEM TO TAKE ACTION AND LOOK MORE CLOSELY AT WHAT\nWOULD ORDINARILY BE FOR EXAMPLE NORMAL VEHICLES.\n>> JUST LIKE WHAT WE SAW. JUST 24 HOURS AGO WHEN WE WERE\nCOVERING THE EXPLOSION AND THEN THE PRESSURE COOKER THAT WAS\nDISCOVERED. AND THEN INVESTIGATORS THOUGHT\nTHAT THERE WAS A THIRD DEVICE, THAT'S JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE ON\nTHAT HEIGHTENED ALERT, SWEEPING THE STREETS OF LOWER MANHATTAN.\nBUT IT TURNED OUT TO BE JUST GARBAGE.\nBUT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR EVERYTHING AS YOU RIGHTLY POINT\nOUT. WHAT ELSE CAN YOU TELL US ALSO,\nDEB, ABOUT THIS TRAFFIC STOP THAT INVESTIGATORS HAVE MADE?\n>> WELL, WHAT WE CAN TELL YOU IS THAT THIS TRAFFIC STOP, IT\nHAPPENED AT ABOUT 8:45 THIS EVENING.\nTHE FBI AND NYPD CONDUCTED WHAT THEY CALL A STOP OF A VEHICLE OF\nINTEREST TO THE INVESTIGATION INTO SATURDAY'S BOMBING IN\nMANHATTAN. BUT THEY'RE NOT TELLING --\nTHEY'RE NOT GIVING ANY OTHER SPECIFICS.\nTHERE IS NO INDICATION, FOR EXAMPLE.\nAND THERE IS REASON FOR THIS. THE HEAD OF THE FBI HERE IN NEW\nYORK SAID THEY'RE REALLY FOCUSED ON OPERATIONAL SECURITY.\nTHEY'RE MAKING SURE THAT NOTHING LEAKS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY\nCOMPROMISE THIS INVESTIGATION. IN ANY SERIOUS WAY.\nTHERE HAS ALREADY BEEN SOME INFORMATION THAT HAS BEEN\nRELEASED THAT IS A CAUSE OF CONCERN OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE THERE\nARE PEOPLE WHO ARE AT LARGE. THERE IS CERTAINLY ONE PERSON\nWHO IS AT LARGE, POSSIBLY MORE. AND YOU NEVER WANT TO GIVE\nANYONE THE HEADS UP AS TO WHAT IT IS INVESTIGATORS ARE\nDISCOVERING. BUT THEY DID RELEASE A PICTURE\nOF THAT PRESSURE COOKER. ON THAT PRESSURE COOKER THERE\nWAS A CELL PHONE. SO OBVIOUSLY IF YOU'VE GOT A\nCELL PHONE, YOU WANT TO SEE IF ANYBODY CALLED THAT CELL PHONE,\nPOSSIBLY, TO DETONATE THE DEVICE.\nAND IF SO, OFFICIALS CAN TRIANGULATE ONE PHONE TO THE\nOTHER AND GET SOME GOOD INFORMATION, SOME GOOD\nINTELLIGENCE. AGAIN, EVERYTHING IS BEING\nLOOKED AT. BUT THEY'RE REALLY TRYING TO BE\nVERY CAREFUL. YOU CAN SEE THE DEVICE THERE.\nTHAT'S THE ONE THAT DID NOT EXPLODE.\nAND GEORGE, LET ME TELL YOU, THE NYPD BOMB SQUAD, THEY WERE ABLE\nTO RENDER THAT SAFE THIS AFTERNOON.\nSO NOW THAT IS IN QUANTICO. IT'S GOING TO BE ANALYZED VERY,\nVERY CLOSELY. BECAUSE THERE MIGHT BE SOME SORT\nOF DNA ON THAT DEVICE. MAYBE A FINGERPRINT.\nIT MAY BE A HAIR. IT MAY BE SOMETHING THAT WILL\nGIVE INFORMATION AS TO WHO MADE THAT DEVICE.\nAND IF THAT PERSON IS IN A SYSTEM, SOME SORT OF A\nGOVERNMENT DATABASE, THAT CAN BE VERY HELPFUL INFORMATION.\nBUT THEY'RE LOOKING AT IT VERY CLOSELY.\n>> DEB, AND YOU SET ME UP FOR THE NEXT THING.\nI WANT TO TALK TO OUR GUEST ABOUT IT.\nBUT THE SIMPLE FACT THAT WHEN PEOPLE SET THESE DEVICES OUT,\nYOU KNOW, A LOT OF TIMES THEY'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT\nYES, FINGERPRINTS ARE LEFT OVER, ESPECIALLY IF THAT DEVICE\nDOESN'T DETONATE. DEBORAH FEYERICK LIVE FOR US IN\nNEW YORK, WE'LL STAY IN TOUCH WITH US THROUGH THE NIGHT AS YOU\nCONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE WORK OF THESE INVESTIGATORS.\nLET'S NOW BRING IN OUR STEVE MOORE, CONTRIBUTING WITH US.\nLAW ENFORCEMENT CONTRIBUTOR. HE IS A RETIRED SUPERVISORY\nSPECIAL AGENT WITH THE FBI LIVE VIA SKYPE IN LOS ANGELES.\nI WANT TO TALK THAN. AND I HEARD YOU SPEAKING WITH MY\nCOLLEAGUE NATALIE ALLEN EARLIER ABOUT IT.\nBUT THE SIMPLE FACT THAT THEY HAVE THIS DEVICE THAT DID NOT\nDETONATE. AND NOW INVESTIGATORS WILL BE\nABLE TO GLEAN SOME INFORMATION FROM IT, STEVE.\n>> YES, THEY WILL. WHEN YOU'RE PUTTING A BOMB TO OR\nAN IED TOGETHER, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SPEND A LOT OF PRIME\nMINISTER WORRYING WHETHER YOU LEAVE FINGERPRINTS ON IT, OR\nWHETHER YOU HAVE TOUCHED THE PHONE THAT YOU'RE TAPING TO THE\nDEVICE BECAUSE YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO BE BLOWN INTO\nITTY-BITTY LITTLE PIECES. AND WHEN IT'S NOT, THAT\nINFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE TO THE FBI AND NEW YORK JOINT\nTERRORISM TASK FORCE. THE OTHER THING IS IT'S GOT A\nCELL PHONE ON IT. AND IF THAT CELL PHONE WAS ON\nAND PART OF THE SYSTEM, MEANING THAT IT WAS PINGING CELLS, YOU\nCOULD TRACK IT BACK FOR TWO WEEKS AND FIND OUT WHERE IT\nSPENDS ITS NIGHTS. SO THAT CELL PHONE IS A GOLD\nMINE. >> ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE\nFACT THAT -- AND AGAIN, THIS IS UNRELATED.\nBUT THESE OFFICERS, THESE INVESTIGATORS HAVE FOUND A\nSITUATION IN NEW JERSEY THAT THEY'RE LOOKING INTO.\nWHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT? WE UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'RE\nLOOKING FOR EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW.\nTHIS HEIGHTENED SENSE OF ALERT. >> WELL, WE WON'T KNOW OBVIOUSLY\nFOR A LITTLE WHILE, GEORGE. AND YOU'RE RIGHT TO ASK THE\nQUESTION. IT COULD BE JUST AN ABUNDANCE OF\nCAUTION. THIS LOOKS SUSPICIOUS.\nAND WE SHOULD BE CHECKING THESE THINGS OUT.\nBUT I DON'T KNOW RIGHT NOW WHETHER I WOULD PUT MUCH\nCREDENCE IN IT. I THINK THIS GROUP WANTED TO\nATTACK NEW YORK. IT'S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE.\nI MEAN, THEY HIT NEW JERSEY, I BELIEVE, BEFORE THE MARINE CORPS\nCHARITY RUN. SO IT COULD BE SOMETHING.\nI WOULDN'T PUT A LOT OF STOCK IN IT RIGHT NOW.\n>> I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS TRAFFIC STOP.\nPOINTING OUT TO VIEWERS NO ONE HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH ANYTHING.\nBUT THIS TRAFFIC STOP THAT HAS BEEN MADE IN CONNECTION WITH\nWHAT HAPPENED IN NEW YORK. OBVIOUSLY, AS YOU POINTED OUT.\nINVESTIGATORS CAN DETERMINE FINGERPRINT INFORMATION FROM,\nYOU KNOW, THINGS THAT DIDN'T DETONATE, THINGS THAT WERE LEFT\nOVER. SO TELL US WHERE WE ARE WITH\nTHAT. >> WELL, THE FBI DOESN'T PATROL.\nTHE JOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCE ISN'T OUT LOOKING FOR PEOPLE\nRANDOMLY. THAT WAS A TARGETED TRAFFIC\nSTOP. AND THE FACT THAT THEY DID IT ON\nA BRIDGE IS INTERESTING TO ME. THAT LOWERS THE RISK OF ANYBODY\nGETTING OUT AND RUNNING BECAUSE THERE IS NOT VERY FAR TO RUN.\nSO I THINK IT WAS CALCULATED. I THINK THE STOP ON THE BRIDGE\nWAS CALCULATED. BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO\nTHAT BECAUSE IT'S -- UNLESS YOU HAVE TO BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO\nJAM TRAFFIC UP. AND THAT'S NOT A GOOD THING.\nTHE FACT THAT THEY -- THE PEOPLE IN THE CAR, THERE WERE FIVE IN\nTHE CAR. THAT'S INTERESTING.\nAND NOW THEY'RE ALL AT FBI HEADQUARTERS.\nTHAT'S INTERESTING TOO. THEY MAY NOT BE UNDER ARREST.\nTHEY MAY NOT EVEN BE UNDER INVESTIGATIVE DETENTION.\nBUT THEY ARE BEING QUESTIONED. >> I WANT YOU TO HELP ME TO\nSQUARE THE CIRCLE. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ASKING THIS\nQUESTION THERE IS CONFUSION ABOUT THE SIMPLE WORD TERRORISM.\nWE KNOW THE GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK HAS COME OUT TO SAY THAT THIS IS\nTERRORISM. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THE MAYOR\nHAS INDICATED THAT THERE IS NO NEXUS TO INTERNATIONAL\nTERRORISM. AT THE SAME TIME THE CITY, NOT\nLOOKING AT THIS AS TERRORISM. >> THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION,\nGEORGE. AND I BELIEVE THE FACT THAT THE\nJOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCE IS STILL WORKING ON IT.\nPROBABLY INDICATE WHERE THIS IS GOING TO GO.\nHOWEVER, YOU'RE CORRECT. THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT KINDS\nOF TERRORISM. YOU COULD HAVE A DOMESTIC\nTERRORIST. YOU COULD HAVE SOMEBODY WHO IS A\nWHITE SUPREMACIST. YOU COULD HAVE SOME INDEPENDENCE\nGROUP FROM PUERTO RICO. I MEAN, I'M NOT SAYING THAT\nTHAT'S LIKELY. BUT THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT\nTYPES OF TERRORISM. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO MEAN ISLAMIC\nTERRORISM. ISIS, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.\n>> STEVE MOORE LIVE FOR US IN LOS ANGELES.\nSTEVE, WE APPRECIATE YOUR INSIGHT.\nWE'LL STAY IN TOUCH WITH YOU. I'M SURE PLENTY OF QUESTIONS\nAHEAD AS WE SEAL TO BE STARTING A BUSY NIGHT WITH INVESTIGATORS\nON THE JOB.",

WE CAN TELL YOU SOURCES NOW TELL\nCNN LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS SURVEILLANCE VIDEO OF THE MAN\nTHEY BELIEVE WAS NEAR BOTH THE DUMPSTER BUT ALSO THE SECOND\nLOCATION. NOW, THE MAN WAS ROLLING A BLACK\nDUFFEL BAG. HE IS SEEN AT THE DUMPSTER ON\nWEST 23rd STREET. HE THEN MAKES HIS WAY NORTH UP\nTO 27th STREET, FOUR BLOCKS, LEAVES THE DUFFEL BAG AND THEN\nWALKS AWAY.

NEW YORKERS ARE A RESILIENT LOT.\nLELAND VITTERT IS IN NEW JERSEY ACROSS THE RIVER WHERE ALL OF\nTHIS WAS CONCLUDED TODAY OR SO THEY HOPE.\nLEYLAND? >> Reporter: THEY CERTAINLY DO\nHOPE, NEIL. THE FBI ACKNOWLEDGES THEY HAVE A\nLOT OF INVESTIGATING AHEAD. THEY HAVE THEIR MAN AND THEY ARE\nNOT LOOKING FOR ANYONE ELSE AS IT RELATES TO THESE EXPLOSIONS\nBOTH IN NEW JERSEY AND OF COURSE IN MANHATTAN THAT INJURED NEARLY\n30 PEOPLE. WE'VE BEEN PUSHED BACK FROM THE\nSCENE OF A WILD WEST SHOOTOUT A COUPLE BLOCKS, POLICE SAY FOR\nOUR OWN SAFETY, AND THEY'VE BEEN CONCERNED THROUGHOUT THIS\nINVESTIGATION OF OTHER EXPLOSIVE DEVICES THAT MAY HAVE BEEN LEFT\nAROUND. THEY ARE INVESTIGATING JUST\nTHAT. IT WAS ABOUT 50 HOURS AFTER THE\nFIRST EXPLOSION THAT THE SHOOTOUT\n28-YEAR-OLD AHMAD RAHAMI. HE WAS SLEEPING IN A VESTIBULE\nOF A LOCAL BAR WHEN SOMEONE ALERTED POLICE.\nTHE SHOOTOUT BEGAN. WITNESSES SAY ABOUT 30 PLUS\nSHOTS FIRED. TWO OFFICERS HIT.\nONE HAD THEIR BULLETPROOF VEST SAVE THEIR LIFE.\nTURNS OUT ACCORDING TO ONE SOURCE, RAHAMI WAS IDENTIFIED BY\nSURVEILLANCE VIDEOS AS THE PERSON BEHIND THESE EXPLOSIONS\nSAYING YOU COULD SEE HIM CLEAR AS DAY.\nIT WAS JUST A FEW HOURS BEFORE THE SHOOTOUT THAT THE FBI\nCONVERGED WITH THE ATF ON RAHAMI'S FAMILY'S FRIED CHICKEN\nRESTAURANT AND APARTMENT UP ABOVE.\nFIRST AMERICAN FRIED CHICKEN IS THE NAME OF THE RESTAURANT.\nTHEY LIVED UPSTAIRS. THERE WAS BOMB DOGS CANVASSING\nTHE NEIGHBORHOODS TO SEE IF THEY COULD SMELL THOSE THINGS.\nWE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FBI TOOK OUT OF THAT RESTAURANT AND THEN\nTHE APARTMENT UPSTAIRS. THE EVIDENCE OF COURSE WILL COME\nOUT LATER. TALKED TO A NUMBER OF RESIDENTS\nIN THAT CITY OF ELIZABETH AROUND HIS HOME AND ALL OF THIS\nHAPPENED IN A FIVE-MILE RADIUS THERE.\nPEOPLE SAYING HE WAS A VERY NICE GUY.\nONE THING THAT REALLY STRUCK ME THAT ONE RESIDENT SAID, THIS\nFELLOW AHMAD WAS AS AMERICAN AS YOU AND I AND CLEARLY THE\nCOMMUNITY ASKING A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER THE FBI\nIS RIGHT, WHAT THEY MISSED ABOUT THEIR NEIGHBOR.\n>> LELAND VITTERT IN LINDEN. ALL RIGHT.\nA LOT WE STILL DON'T KNOW ABOUT WHETHER THIS GUY WAS ACTING\nALONE, WHAT TURNED HIM SO ANGRY WHERE HE WOULD WANT TO DO THIS.\nFORMER FBI ASSISTANT DIRECTOR, RON, WHAT DO YOU THINK?\n>> I THINK WE HAVE A LOT TO LEARN HERE.\nHOPEFULLY THE FBI'S INTERVIEW TECHNIQUES ARE SUCCESSFUL AND\nTHEY CAN LEARN FIRST AND FOREMOST WHO HELPED HIM.\nWHO KNEW, WHO",

CERTAINLY THEY'RE GOING TO FOCUS\nIN ON IS HE THE GUY THAT PUT THE BOMBS IN NEW YORK CITY AND NEW\nJERSEY? YOU KNOW, THAT TYPE OF STUFF.\nI KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO SOLVE THIS FAIRLY QUICKLY.\nTHIS WAS JUST SPECULATION THIS IS GOOD NIGHT.\nASSUMING IT IS, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE GOING TO BE DIVING INTO\nEVERYTHING TO DO WITH HIM. WHERE HE LIVED, WHO WAS THE --\nWHAT IS ON SOCIAL -- THE NETWORKS, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH,\nBLAH. WHERE HAS HE BEEN THE LAST 48\nHOURS, WHO DOES HE HANG OUT WITH, ALL THESE TYPES OF THINGS.\n>> WHY WERE YOU SO CONFIDENT THIS WOULD HAPPEN QUICKLY, HIS\nBEING BROUGHT INTO CUSTODY? > WELL, IN NEW YORK CITY YOU\nCAN WALK AROUND THERE YOU ARE ON VIDEO SOMEWHERE.\nTHERE WERE UNEXPLODED DEVICES. THAT'S LIKE A GOLD MINE TO THE\nFBI LABORATORY. THE FBI LABORATORY HAS\nINVESTIGATIONS OF BOMBINGS AROUND THE WORLD FOR THE LAST\nDECADE SO THEY KNOW EVERY LITTLE THING ABOUT HOW A BOMB IS PUT\nTOGETHER.

THEY'RE GOING TO BE DROP AND RUN\nTYPE DEVICES. I HOPE I'M WRONG, BUT THE\nREALITY IS WE DON'T HAVE A CLUE WHO COMES AND GOES INTO THE\nUNITED STATES. THE FBI, I HAVE BEEN TALKING\nABOUT THIS FOR A LONG, LONG TIME.\nTHEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM WE'RE\nFACING TODAY. THE CONGRESS AND THE WHITE HOUSE\nREFUSES TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.\nTHE BORDER IS WIDE OPEN. YOU CAN DRIVE MACK TRUCKS OVER\nIT ALL DAY. >> I THINK WE HAVE TOUCHED ON\nTHAT IN THE PAST.

HIS NAME IS AHMAD KHAN RAHAMI\nWANTED IN THE NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY EXPLOSIONS.\nHE'S 28 YEARS OLD. HE WAS BORN IN AFGHANISTAN, A\nNATURALIZED AMERICAN CITIZEN. HIS LAST KNOWN RESIDENCE WAS IN\nNEW JERSEY.

AND THEY SAY THAT AHMAD KAHN\nRAHAMI IS 28 YEARS OLD AND THE LAST KNOWN ADDRESS IS ELIZABETH,\nNEW JERSEY. THEY HAVE GOTTEN SIGNIFICANT\nCLUES AND HELP FROM VIDEO SURVEILLANCE RIGHT HERE IN\nMANHATTAN. THEY SAY RAHAMI WAS SEEN AT THE\nLOCATION RIGHT HERE AT WEST 23rd STREET WHERE THE EXPLOSION\nHAPPENED ON SATURDAY NIGHT AND JUST FOUR BLOCKS NORTH OF HERE\nON WEST 27th WHERE THAT PRESSURE COOKER WAS FOUND.\nTHEY SAY THAT THE VIDEOS SHOW RAHAMI WITH A BLACK DUFFEL BAG\nON WHEELS AT THIS LOCATION AND THEN ALSO AT THE WEST 27th\nSTREET LOCATION. THEY SAY THEY ALSO FOUND VIDEO\nEVIDENCE OF TWO OTHER MEN WHO WERE SOMEHOW ASSOCIATED WITH\nTHAT DUFFEL BAG.

I AM NOT SURPRISED THAT THEY ARE\nNOW IDENTIFYING A PERPETRATOR. WHETHER THAT PERPETRATOR IS THE\nSAME ONE THAT WAS HERE IN SEASIDE PARK, I DON'T KNOW.\nBUT ALL THE RESOURCES FROM THE LOCAL TO THE COUNTY TO STATE AND\nOF COURSE THE FEDERAL OFFICE ARE VERY SOPHISTICATED, VERY\nTHOROUGH IN THEIR INVESTIGATION. SO I'M NOT SURPRISED AT ALL.\n>> DOES IT SURPRISE YOU THAT SOURCES ARE TELLING US THAT THE\nSEASIDE PARK EXPLOSION IS NOW CONNECTED TO THE EXPLOSION IN\nCHELSEA? >> I DON'T KNOW THAT.\nI WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED, BUT IT COULD BE -- IT COULD BE A SINGLE\nEVENT. AND I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED\nABOUT THAT ALSO. RIGHT NOW I'M CONCERNED ABOUT\nSEASIDE PARK. AND MY NEIGHBORS AND\nCONSTITUENTS. AND, OF COURSE, THE LOCAL\nAUTHORITIES THAT ARE DOING THEIR BEST JOB TO MAKE SURE THAT\nTHEY'RE VIGILANT AND THAT IF THERE IS ANYTHING OUT OF THE\nORDINARY, THAT THEY IMMEDIATELY TAKE CARE OF THAT.\n>> IS THERE FEAR THAT THERE MAY BE MORE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES OUT\nTHERE SOMEWHERE? >> WELL, OF COURSE THERE'S A\nFEAR. SO THAT IS WHY, THAT IS WHY YOU\nSTEP UP YOUR OBSERVATION, YOUR INDI\nINDIVIDUAL LENS AND SO ON. THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE THERE\nCOULD HAVE BEEN SOMETHING ELSE. AND WE DON'T KNOW THAT.\nAND I DON'T KNOW IF THE FBI IS TRACKING IT THAT WAY.\nI'M SURE THE POSSIBILITY IS THERE.\n>> MR.

I THINK THAT WE SUPPORT THOSE\nTHAT WE HAVE IN THOSE POSITIONS. AND WE CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH\nTHEM. AS FAR AS TYING THEIR HANDS, I\nKNOW THERE ARE MANY, MANY POLICIES AND PRACTICES AND\nTHINGS THAT NEED TO BE OBSERVED. I UNDERSTAND THAT.\nBUT JUST LIKE IN ANY OTHER PROFESSION, THOSE ARE THE RULES\nOF THE ROAD. YOU MOVE FORWARD.\nYOU DO THE BEST JOB YOU POSSIBLY CAN.\n>> SOURCES ARE ALSO TELLING US THAT THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY\nTHAT IT IS SOME SORT OF TERRORIST CELL THAT MAY BE AT\nWORK HERE, NOT JUST LONE WOLVES, BUT A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE\nCOORDINATED IN THEIR EFFORTS. YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT.\n>> WE FOUND THAT AFTER 9/11 THAT THERE WERE THESE CELLS AROUND,\nAND I BELIEVE THAT SOME OF THEM WERE IN THE VICINITY OF SEASIDE\nPARK. AND IN OCEAN COUNTY.\nSO THESE ARE POSSIBLE. I MEAN, THESE ARE CERTAINLY\nPOSSIBLE. THE WORLD IS A MUCH SMALLER\nPLACE THAN IT EVER WAS. BUT TO THINK THAT SOMETHING LIKE\nTHIS COULD HAPPEN HERE IS CONNECTED GLOBALLY INTO A\nSUBVERSIVE GROUP SOMEWHERE ELSE IS HARD TO FIND.\n>> ROBERT MATTHEW FROM SEASIDE PARK, NEW JERSEY.\nTHANK YOU FOR BEING WE.

UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF OBAMA\nAND CLINTON AMERICANS HAVE EXPERIENCED MORE ATTACKS AT HOME\nTHAN VICTORIES ABROAD. TIME TO CHANGE THE PLAYBOOK.\nSEVEN DAYS BEFORE DEBATE NUMBER ONE.\nNOW A SIGNIFICANT NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE.\nKATIE, START. ABOUT CHANGING THE PLAYBOOK.\nHOW FAR DOES THAT GO? >> YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND\nHILLARY CLINTON IS PART OF BARACK OBAMA FOREIGN POLICY.\nFOR THE SECOND HALF OF HIS TERM AT SECRETARY OF STATE.\nTHE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION LIED TO THE AMERICAN VOTER WHEN THEY\nSAID AL QAEDA WAS ON THE RUN. THEY SIGNIFICANTLY DOWNPLAYED\nTHE THREAT FROM ISIS IN THE UNITED STATES BY HAVING\nINTELLIGENCE REPORTS SCRUBBED AND PAINT A ROSIER PICTURE SO\nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE FELT THERE WASN'T SO MUCH OF A THREAT.\nHILLARY CLINTON ISSUED A STATEMENT SAYING THE APPARENT\nTERRORIST ATTACKS IN NEW JERSEY AND NEW YORK.\nWHY ARE WE STILL NOT CALLING THE ENEMY WHAT IT IS AND SAYING WHAT\nWE ARE DEALING WITH. I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE\nLOOKING AT THIS SAYING HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH\nTHIS BEFORE PEOPLE WHO WORKED FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HILLARY\nCLINTON WHO WANTS TO MAINTAIN HIS THIRD TERM, IS ACTUALLY\nGOING TO CALL THE ENEMY WHAT IT IS.\nBILL: MARY ANNE? >> LOOK AT THE LATEST FOX POLL\nWHERE VOTERS SEE HILLARY CLINTON MORE QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT.\nTHEY SEE HER AS HAVING A BETTER TEMPERAMENT THAN DONALD TRUMP.\nAND YOU CAN SEE WHY IN THIS INCIDENT.\nSHE WAITED FOR THE FACTS. SHE CONTINUES TO WAIT FOR THE\nFACTS AS THEY UNFOLD. AND SHE HAS A MEASURED RESPONSE.\nDONALD TRUMP NO FACTS AND STOKING FEAR.\nDO YOU WANT TO GIVE THE ENEMY WHAT WE WANT, THEY WANT US\nRUNNING AROUND COWERING IN CORN. OR DO YOU WANT US TO GO ABOUT\nOUR BUSINESS LIKE THE PEOPLE DID IN NEW YORK CITY.\nTHE NEW YORK FIRE DEPARTMENT AND EVEN THE HEAD OF THE F.B.I. IN\nMINNESOTA.

THE LIKES OF WHICH WE HAVE NOT\nSEEN SINCE THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR IN GERMANY.\nTHIS IS RESOUNDING STUFF. NOW WE ARE ABOUT TO GET A\nMEASURE, KATIE, IN 50 DAYS ABOUT HOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FEEL\nABOUT WATCHING THIS AND WHETHER WE CAN END IT.\n>> YOU LOOK AT THE SITUATION HERE IN THE SENSE OF WHAT YOU\nJUST MENTIONED WITH BERLIN, YOU SAW BREXIT.\nTHAT WAS AN ISSUE IN GERMANY OF LETTING IN PEOPLE WHO ARE\nUNVETTED FROM TERRORISM HOTPOTS. PRESIDENT OBAMA WANTS 100,000\nMORE REFUGEES TO COME INTO THE COUNTRIES UNVETTED FROM\nTERRORISM HOTPOTS ALL OVER THE WORLD.\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS THE SAME POLICY.\nHERE WE ARE WITH SOMEONE BORN IN SOMALIA CAMS INTO THE UNITED\nSTATES THROUGH AFGHANISTAN. NO TALK ABOUT HOW TO PREVENT\nTHAT. ONE THING THAT BOTH OF THE\nCANDIDATES ARE LOOKING HERE AND THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IN GENERAL.\nWE HAVE A SEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING POLICY.\nBUT HOW TO RESPOND WHEN THESE THINGS HAPPEN?\nWE SAW AN OFF-DUTY POLICE OFFICER SHOOT AND KILL A SOMALI\nTERRORIST STABBING PEOPLE IN A MINNESOTA MALL.\nTHE POLICE AND THE F.B.I. CAN'T BE EVERYWHERE.\nBILL: IT'S AN INTERESTING ARGUMENT ABOUT CHANGE THE\nPLAYBOOK. MARY ANNE, WHY ARE YOU ON THAT.\n>> IF YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE ELECTION.\nTHE TRUMP SUPPORTERS WILL LOVE HOW DONALD TRUMP RESPONDED TO\nTHIS. THE CLINTON SUPPORTERS WILL\nSUPPORT HER. BUT THE LAST GROUP OF VOTERS WHO\nARE UP FOR GRABS ARE WHITE COLLEGE EDUCATED WOMEN, PERIOD.\nDONALD TRUMP IS LOSING WITH THEM OVERWHELMINGLY AND CAN'T WIN THE\nWHITE HOUSE WITH THEM. WHITE COLLEGE EDUCATED WOMEN\nWOULD FAR PREFER THE RESPONSE BY HILLARY CLINTON A MEASURES\nRESPONSE BASED ON FACTS VERSUS DONALD TRUMP SHOOT FROM THE HIP,\nNO FACTS, FUELING FEAR. BILL: DONALD TRUMP MADE HIS\nSTATEMENT CLEAR, CHANGE THE PLAYBOOK.\nWE'LL SEE HOW PEOPLE REACT. MARTHA: WE HAVE BRAND-NEW\nPICTURES NOW OF THE SUSPECT IN THE MANHUNT, AHMAD KAHN RAHAMI.\nTHESE ARE MORE IMAGES OF HIM AS POLICE IN THE AREA ENCOURAGE\nEVERYONE TO BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR THIS MAN.\nHE'S 6'4, 200 POUND.

WEAKNESS INVITES AGGRESSION.\n>> JOINING ME NOW IS THE SENIOR FELLOW AT THE BROOKINGS\nINSTITUTION. AS WELL AS THE FORMER NATIONAL\nSECURITY SPOKESMAN FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA.\nLET ME START WITH YOU. FIRST OF ALL, LET'S START WITH\nTHIS IDEA THAT THE KEY IN ALL THIS IS THE MAGICAL WORDS\nISLAMIC TERRORISM OR RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM THAT IF YOU\nSAY THAT, THAT INSTANTLY ALTERS THE ENTIRE TRAJECTORY OF THE\nPROBLEM THAT THE U.S. AND SO MANY OTHER NATIONS FACE.\n>> SO I HAVE O TO SAY IT'S REALLY BIZARRE THAT WE'RE\nFOCUSING SO MUCH ON HOW TO ARRANGE WORDS IN DESCRIBING\nTERRORISM, WHICH ALL OF US AS AMERICANS ARE AGAINST.\nAND TRUMP HAS MADE THIS INTO A NATIONAL CONVERSATION ABOUT\nWHETHER TO INCLUDE THE WORD ISLAMIC OR RADICAL.\nTHAT'S QUITE FRANKLY A DISTRACTION FROM ACTUALLY DOING\nTHE WORK TO FIGHT TERRORISM. TALKING ABOUT OUR LONG-TERM\nSTRATEGIC VISION IN THE MIDDLE EAST.\nTHAT'S WHAT WE AS A NATION SHOULD BE DISCUSSING.\nIT'S NOT JUST TRUMP. IT'S MANY REPUBLICANS OBSESSED\nWITH THESE PARTICULAR WORDS. AND I THINK THAT IT ALSO SHOWS\nTHAT MANY REPUBLICANS AND TRUMP IN PARTICULAR DON'T REALLY CARE\nABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE ALIENATING MUSLIM MAJORITY\nCOUNTIES THAT ARE ALLIES OR MUSLIMS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD BY\nUSING THIS KIND OF INFLAMMATORY LANGUAGE.\nI THINK RADICAL ISLAM AS A PHRASE HAS BECOME A KIND OF\nSTAND IN FOR ANTI-MUSLIM BIGOTRY.\nWE HAVE TO PUSH BACK AGAINST THAT, NOT ENCOURAGE IT.\n>> PART OF WHAT MAKES THIS PART OF THE BROADER ARGUMENT DONALD\nTRUMP IS MAKING IS BASICALLY THAT THE SOLUTIONS AREN'T\nCOMPLICATED, THEY ARE SIMPLE. THAT'S THE CASE.\nOBAMA IS WEAK AND I'M TOUGH. WHEN I'M IN OFFICE, WE'RE GOING\nTO GET TOUGH AND KNOCK THE HELL OUT OF THEM.\nYOU HAVE TO SAY THE MAGIC WORDS. HOW DO YOU RESPOND WHEN THE\nACTUAL ANSWER IS THAT IT'S VERY COMPLICATED AND HARD?\n>> TO HIS POINT, A PIECE OVER THE WEEKEND LOOKED BACK AT\nANWAR'S WRITINGS. HE WROTE A PIECE ABOUT HOW IN\nMANY WAYS TRUMP'S RHETORIC IS MAKING THE VISION OF A WAR OF\nTHE WEST AGAINST ISLAM COME TRUE.\nSO IN MANY WAYS, TRUMP IS MAKING THE JOB OF COUNTERTERRORISM\nPROFESSIONALS HARDER. I THINK CLINTON'S RESPONSE WAS\nFAR MORE MEASURED. SHE TALKED ABOUT VIGILANCE AND\nRESIL RESILIENCE.\nTHOSE ARE THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT IN HOW\nWE RESPOND TO AN EVENT LIKE THIS, SORT OF PREPARING FOR THE\nCOUNTRY FOR THE FACT THAT THERE WILL BE ATTACKS AGAINST OUR\nCOUNTRY. THE PROBLEM IS HIS ACTIONS\nSAYING WE'RE GOING TO RACIALLY PROFILE MUSLIMS, BANNING THEM\nFROM COMING TO THE COUNTRY, TELLING REFUGEES SOME OF THE\nMOST DESPERATE PEOPLE ON THE FACE OF THE PLANET THAT THEY\nHAVE NO PLACE HERE AND WE WILL NOT HELP THEM, THAT'S GOING TO\nMAKE RECRUITING MUCH EASIER FOR ISIS AND FOR AL QAEDA.\n>> I HEAR THIS NOW. IT'S BIZARRE THAT WE ENTER INTO\nA NEWS CYCLE IN WHICH WHO IS ISIS VOTING FOR.\nI WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR. THAT SAID AS A FACTUAL\nDESCRIPTIVE MATTER, YOU WERE RESPONDING TO HILLARY CLINTON'S\nASSESSMENT OF ISIS ROOTING FOR A TRUMP VICTORY AND SAYING IT IS\nNOT AN OUTLANDING CLAIM. >> AS A FACTUAL MATTER, HILLARY\nCLINTON IS CORRECT. CURRENT AND FORMER ISIS MEMBERS\nHAVE SAID THAT THEY PREFER TRUMP AND TWO RESEARCHERS WHO WORK ON\nTHIS ISSUE. TRUMP HAS MADE AN APPEARANCE IN\nAT LEAST TWO ISIS VIDEOS. SO I MEAN, IT'S NOT A MYSTERY.\nWE DON'T HAVE TO SPECULATE. THAT'S CLEAR.\nI THINK IT'S ALSO INTUITIVE. AS YOU'RE SAYING ISIS WANTS TO\nPROMOTE A CLASS OF CIVILUATIONS. THAT BENEFIT FROM AN ATMOSPHERE\nOF CONFLICT, DIVISION AND POLARIZATION.\nWHO ELSE PROMOTES A NARRATIVE OF POLARIZATION AND DIVISION?\nDONALD TRUMP DOES. WHAT ISIS REALLY WANTS TO DO IS\nTHEY WANT MUSLIMS IN THE WEST TO FEEL LIKE THEY DON'T FULLY\nBELONG AS CITIZENS. THEY WANT TO PROMOTE LONE WOLF\nATTACKS. SO I WORRY THAT WE'RE FALLING\nINTO THIS TRAP. .\nTHAT'S WHAT ALWAYS HAPPENS AFTER TERRORIST ATTACKS.\nTHERE'S AN UP SURGE OF ANTI-MUSLIM SENTIMENT, WHICH\nTRUMP IS REALLY PLAYING INTO. BUT THAT ONLY BENEFITS ISIS.\nTHEY WANT THE RISE OF THE FAR RIGHT IN EUROPE AND THE U.S.\n>> TOMMY, HAVING WORKED IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND BEEN SORT OF\nPART OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY DECISION MAKING PROCESS AND ALL\nTHAT MEANS, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT WH YOU THINK ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP SITTING IN THE SITUATION ROOM SAY AFTER SOME\nGOD FORBID TERRIBLE ATTACK IN THE U.S. AND WHAT THAT COULD\nLOOK LIKE AND WHAT IT COULD MEAN.\n>> THERE'S AN ENORMOUS PUSH ON PRESIDENTS AFTER A CRISIS LIKE\nTHIS TO DO SOMETHING, WHATEVER THAT MAY BE.\nTO SHOW ACTION, TO DEMONSTRATE RESOLVE, TO BLOW SOMETHING UP.\nI THINK WHAT MAKES MESO SCARED ABOUT TRUMP IS HOW EASILY HE CAN\nBE BAITED. HOW WILLING HE IS TO LASH OUT TO\nTHROW OUT CRAZY IDEAS ABOUT GETTING TOUGH, PROFILING AN\nENTIRE RELIGION, BANNING ENTIRE RELIGION FROM THE COUNTRY.\nAND I THINK HIS INABILITY TO SORT OF BE MEASURED, TO SHOW ANY\nRESTRAINT IS WHAT'S PROBABLY THE SCARIEST THING ABOUT HIS\nCANDIDACY. >> THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR TIME,\nAPPRECIATE IT.",

LET'S DO THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF\nFEAR MMONGERING, MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF TURN EACH OTHER AGAINST EACH\nOTHER. THAT'S WHAT DONALD TRUMP WANTS.\nBECAUSE FOR DONALD TRUMP, THIS IS ALL POLITICS, ALL THE TIME.\nAND THAT'S WHY IT IS HE CANNOT BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES. >> YOU HAVE STRONG WORDS ABOUT\nHIS COMMENTS ABOUT TAKING THE GUNS AWAY FROM THE SECRET\nSERVICE AND WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.\nDO YOU THINK HE'S ACTUALLY INTIMATING, SUGGESTING OR URGING\nVIOLENCE? >> WHAT ELSE DO YOU THINK HE\nMEANS WHEN HE SAYS, LET THE SECRET SERVICE LAY DOWN THEIR\nARMS AND LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. OF COURSE, HE IS.\nI'M SORRY. FOR ME THAT'S NOT EVEN WINK,\nWINK, NOD, NOD. THIS IS DONALD TRUMP SAYING,\nHEY, THERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO DEAL  AGAIN, THIS KIND OF GOES BACK TO\nTHIS QUESTION ABOUT WHAT KIND OF A HUMAN BEING ARE WE TALKING\nABOUT? SO HE'S LOSING TO HILLARY\nCLINTON AND HIS ANSWER IS TO SAY SOMEBODY SHOULD GET OUT THERE\nAND DO VIOLENCE. AND LOOK, I GET IT.\nCAMPAIGNS ARE A TIME OF HEATED RHETORIC.\nPEOPLE CAN GET EXCITED. THEY CAN OVERREACH AND SAY\nTHINGS THEY DON'T MEAN. BUT DONALD TRUMP HAS NOW DONE\nTHIS TWICE AND HE'S BEEN CALLED OUT FOR IT BOTH TIMES.\nWHEN YOU DO IT TWICE, IT SEEMS TO ME PRETTY CLEAR WHAT YOUR\nMOTIVATION IS HERE. SO I THINK IT'S JUST ONE MORE\nEXAMPLE OF WHY DONALD TRUMP NOT ONLY SHOULDN'T BE PRESIDENT, BUT\nIS TRULY DISQUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT.\n>> I WATCHED YOUR APPEARANCE ON THE STUMP THIS WEEKEND.\nI WAS STRUCK IN SOME WAYS IT WAS ALMOST BEAMED FROM AN ALTERNATE\nDIMENSION. THE REASON I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE\nDONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN SUCH A FORCE.\nHIS POLICIES CAN BE SO IMPOSSIBLE TO PIN DOWN.\nHE DOESN'T SEEM TO CARE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.\nHE WILL SAY ONE THING AND BACKTRACK.\nYOU WERE LAYING OUT A SORT OF DEMOCRATIC POLICY DOMESTIC\nAGENDA ON THE STUMP. DO YOU THINK THERE'S BEEN TOO\nLITTLE ATTENTION PAID TO THAT? WHAT'S THE ELEVATOR PITCH WHEN\nYOU GUESS DOWN TO THE BRASS TAX OF WHAT A HILLARY CLINTON\nPRESIDENCY LOOKS LIKE? >> SO, LOOK, MY SWING AT DONALD\nTRUMP A COUPLE TIMES, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE REASON TO\nVOTE FOR HILLARY CLINTON AND ALL THE PLACES I GO TO VOTE FOR TED\nSTRICKLAND IN OHIO, TO VOTE FOR OUR DEMOCRATIC SENATE CANDIDATES\nAND OUR HOUSE CANDIDATES IS BECAUSE WE REALLY DO HAVE IDEAS\nABOUT HOW WE BUILD A FUTURE. DONALD TRUMP BELIEVES THAT THE\nWAY WE BUILD A FUTURE IS THE SAME WAY THE REPUBLICANS\nBELIEVE. THAT IS, HEY, LET THOSE WHO ARE\nRICH AND POWERFUL HAVE MORE MONEY AND MORE POWER AND SOMEHOW\nIT'S GOING TO TRICKLE DOWN FOR EVERYONE ELSE.\nWE HAVE NOW TRIED THAT FOR 35 YEARS AND IT HAS BEEN A COMPLETE\nCATASTROPHE FOR THIS COUNTRY. THE DEMOCRATS ARE SAYING WE E\nKNOW HOW TO DO THIS. WE KNOW HOW TO REGULATE\nFINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SO THEY DON'T BRING OUR ECONOMY DOWN.\nWE KNOW HOW TO MAKE THE INVESTMENTS IN EXPANDING\nOPPORTUNITY. OPPORTUNITY NOT JUST FOR SOME OF\nUS, BUT FOR ALL OF US. THAT'S A BIG PART OF WHAT MY\nSPEECH WAS ABOUT. THE PIECES OF THAT, THE PIECES\nTHAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS RUN ON, THE PIECES THAT I BELIEVE SHE\nSHOULD WIN ON AND THEN THE PIECES THAT THE REST OF US HAVE\nGOT TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE IS ABLE TO ENACT ONCE SHE'S\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. >> YOU JUST TOUCHED ON FINANCIAL\nREGULATION. THERE'S A PERFECT LITTLE\nMICROCOMP OF THIS ISSUE IN THE WELLS FARGO SITUATION, IN HAD\nWHICH CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU, WHICH WAS\nYOUR BRAIN CHILD AND YOU SHEPARDED INTO BEING WAS\nINSTRUMENTAL IN DISCOVERING FRAUD.\nWELLS FARGO HAS BEEN CAUGHT AND WILL HAVE TO GIVE MONEY BACK TO\nCUSTOMERS AND THERE'S GOING TO BE HEARINGS TOMORROW.\nTHAT'S A BUREAU THAT'S, I UNDERSTAND, AT THE HEAD OF THE\nLINE TO BE DESTROYED UNDER A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENCY.\n>> I THINK THAT'S NO SURPRISE. SO DONALD TRUMP HAS SAID FIRST\nDAY OF A DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENCY HE WANTS TO ROLL BACK ALL OF\nDODD-FRANK, INCLUDING THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION\nBUREAU. REPUBLICANS IN BOTH THE HOUSE\nAND THE SENATE ARE MOVING FORWARD BILLS TO TRY TO LEASH UP\nTHE WATCHDOG AND PULL AT ITS TEETH SO THERE WON'T BE ANOTHER\nWELLS FARGO. WHEN I SAY WON'T BE ANOTHER\nWELLS FARGO, I DON'T MEAN THERE WON'T BE GIANT BANKS CHEATING\nPEOPLE. THAT WILL CONTINUE TO HAPPEN.\nTHERE JUST WON'T BE A CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU TO\nCALL THEM OUT. THAT'S WHAT THIS IS, THE\nREPUBLICANS AND THE GIANT WALL STREET BANKS WANT.\nFOR ME, THAT'S A BIG PART OF WHAT THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT.\nIS ABOUT FIGHTING BACK AGAINST THAT AND SAYING WE CANNOT RUN\nTHIS COUNTRY JUST FOR THOSE AT THE TOP 37.\nWE CANNOT RUN IT JUST FOR WALL STREET.\nWE HAVE TO RUN IT FOR ALL OF US. AND THE WELLS FARGO EXAMPLE,\nYOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT. THAT'S IT IN A MICROKOS M.\n>> YOU COULD WRITE A BOOK ABOUT THE EFFORTS TO KILL OFF THIS\nTHING. IT'S FUNCTIONING AND WORKING IS\nA MIRACLE. SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN, THANK\nYOU FOR YOUR TIME. >> YOU BET.\nIT'S SO GOOD TO BE HERE.",

              "text": "BUT DON'T LOSE SIGHT OF THE FACT\nTAT THE U.S., HE WANTED TO SUGGEST IS ACTUALLY WINNING IN\nTHIS WAR AGAINST TERRORISM. IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS\nHAPPENING IN IRAQ AND SYRIA AS FAR AS ISIS IS CONCERNED, HE\nSAYS THE U.S. IS MAKING SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS, TAKING OUT\nISIS LEADERS, ALTHOUGH AL-BAGHDADI STILL REMAINS AT\nLARGE. AND MOSUL, THE SECOND LARGEST\nCITY IN IRAQ IS UNDER THE CONTROL OF ISIS AND REMAINS\nUNDER THE CONTROL OF ISIS. AND RAQQAH, THE CAPITOAL OF ISI\nSTILL REMAINS THE CAPITAL OF ISIS.\nTHERE IS STILL AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WORK TO DO.\nTHERE IS STILL THE FACT THAT ISIS, AL QAEDA, THE OTHER\nTERRORISTS HAVE THE ABILITY TO INSIGHT TERRORISTS ON THEIR OWN\nTHROUGH THE INTERNET. THEY HAVE THESE CAPABILITIES AND\nTHESE KINDS OF BOMBS APPARENTLY THAT WE SAW IN NEW YORK AND NEW\nJERSEY, THESE ARE UNSOPHISTICATED KINDS OF BOMBS.\n\"INSPIRE\" MAGAZINE, THE AL QAEDA MAGAZINE HAD AN ARTICLE IN HOW\nTO BUILD A BOMB IN THE KITCHEN OF YOUR MOM.\nTHEY ARE ENCOURAGING FOLLOWERS TO GO OUT TO BUILD A BOMB AND DO\nDAMAGE, IF NOT A BOMB, GET A GUN AND KILL INFIDELS.\nIF YOU DON'T HAVE A GUN, GET A CAR AND DRIVE OVER PEOPLE.\nIF NOT, JUST GET A KNIFE AND GO TO A MALL AND START SLASHING AS\nMANY INFIDELS AS THEY CALL THEM AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN.\nSO THERE IS AN ENORMOUS THREAT OUT THERE.\nWE HAVE SEEN IT UNFOLD OVER THE PAST 48 HOURS.\nBUT THE PRESIDENT WANTED TO REASSURE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC\nTHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT, THE FBI, LOCAL COMMUNITIES, THEY HAVE AN\nABILITY TO DEAL WITH THIS. YES, IT'S A PROBLEM, BUT DON'T\nGO OVERBOARD. >> WOLF, WE ARE LOOKING AT LIVE\nPICTURES FROM LINDEN, NEW JERSEY.\nTHIS IS 15 MINUTES FROM ELIZABETH WHERE RAIDS WERE\nTAKING PLACE OVERNIGHT WHERE THE SUSPECT IS BELIEVED TO HAVE\nLIVED. RAHAMI, THIS IS WHERE A\nSHOOT-OUT TOOK PLACE. AND HE WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY.\nIF HE DID DECIDE TO GET THERE BY TRAIN, VERY INTERESTING.\nI WANT TO BRING IN EVAN PEREZ. IT WAS EVIDENT AND VERY\nINTERESTING. EVAN, AS WE LEARNED OF THIS MAN,\nTHE BREAKING NEWS OF THE SUSPECT TAKEN INTO CUSTODY, WE ARE ALSO\nGETTING A STATEMENT FROM THE PRESIDENT WHO EITHER DIDN'T KNOW\nOR DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IT. SO EITHER HE DIDN'T WANT TO\nFOCUS ON IT AT ALL OR HADN'T YET BEEN BRIEFED.\n>> IT APPEARS HE WAS NOT BRIEFED JUST BEFORE HE GOT IN.\nTHIS WAS HAPPENING AS HE WAS BALK WALKING UP TO THE PODIUM.\nTHE FBI WAS MAKING SURE THEY HAVE THE RIGHT GUY.\nTHERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT GOES INTO DOING THIS.\nAND I THINK THE MESSAGE WAS GETTING SENT UP FROM THE ARREST\nSCENE THERE IN LINDEN, NEW JERSEY.\nBACK TO WASHINGTON. AND THEN OVER TO THE WHITE\nHOUSE. AND I THINK THAT'S THE PERHAPS\nDELAY THERE. WE'LL HEAR QUICKLY THIS HAS BEEN\nCONFIRMED AND WILL HEAR THE INITIAL ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE\nFBI THAT THEY HAVE ARRESTED THIS MAN.\nBUT WE WERE WATCHING THIS HAPPENING AS IT WAS GOING DOWN.\nAND THERE WERE PEOPLE, NEIGHBORS WHO WERE ABLE TO' THE SHOOT-OUT\nAND WERE ABLE TO POST PICTURES ON SOCIAL MEDIA.\nTHESE ARE THE TIMES WE LIVE IN. SOMETIMES THE PRESIDENT GETS\nINFORMATION MORE QUICKLY FROM SOCIAL MEDIA THAN FROM THE\nPEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE BRIEFING HIM.\nIT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. >> IT'S AMAZING HOW IT'S PLAYING\nOUT IN REALTIME RIGHT NOW. WE'LL TAKE A MOMENT AND GO TO\nTHE SCENE, DREW GRIFFIN IS DOWN ON THE SCENE.\nARE YOU IN ELIZABETH OR LINDEN? I'M SORRY, I HAVE A LOT OF\nMOVING PARTS HERE. >> Reporter: WE ARE IN LINDEN\nWHERE THIS APPARENTLY HAS ENDED. WE KNOW RAHMAD RAHAMI IS IN\nCUSTODY. WE ARE PUTTING THIS TOGETHER\nVERY ROUGHLY FROM EARWITNESSES AND PEOPLE WHO WERE ON THE\nSTREET. THE SUSPECT MAY HAVE BEEN\nSPOTTED SLEEPING IN THE BAR AND THAT'S WHEN POLICE APPROACHED\nHIM TO SEE HE FIT THE SAME DESCRIPTION.\nANOTHER PERSON SAID THEY HEARD SHOTS ALONG WITH A MASSIVE\nAMOUNT OF SIRENS. THAT'S ALL WE KNOW AT THIS\nPOINT, KATE. OTHER THAN PAMELA BROWN IS\nREPORTING THAT THE SUSPECT IS IN CUSTODY.\nWE'RE OBVIOUSLY WAITING FOR POLICE TO GET BACK TO US HERE AT\nTHIS SCENE. YOU CAN IMAGINE IT IS RATHER\nCHAOTIC. >> STAND BY.\nTHE NEWS IS THAT AHMAD RAHAMI IS NOW IN CUSTODY AFTER A SHOOT-OUT\nNOT FAR FROM WHERE DREW GRIFFIN IS IN LINDEN, NEW JERSEY.\nAPPARENTLY PAMELA BROWN REPORTS ONE POLICE OFFICER WAS WOUNDED\nIN THAT. IF WE HAVE A FORMER OFFICIAL OF\nTHE U.S. MARSHAL SERVICE HERE, DO WE HAVE ART WITH US?\nBRING ART INTO THE DISCUSSION RIGHT NOW.\nART, THIS MAN NOW IN CUSTODY, THIS HAPPENED REMARKABLY\nQUICKLY, THE BOMB WAS PLACED, THE FIRST BOMB WAS PLACED\nSATURDAY NIGHT AROUND 8:40. A SERIES OF THREE EXPLOSIONS\nOVER TWO DAYS, THE BULLET WAS THE MAN'S PICTURE GOING OUT A\nCOUPLE HOURS AGO. NOW HE'S IN CUSTODY.\nTHAT IS FAST, FAST WORK. >> WELL, IT REALLY DOESN'T\nSURPRISE ME. THERE WAS SO MUCH INFORMATION\nAND SO MANY LEADS SINCE THIS WHOLE THING STARTED, THAT IT\nDOESN'T SURPRISE ME THAT THEY HAVE HIM IN CUSTODY ALREADY.\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MAKEUP OF THE TERRORISM TASK FORCE.\nAND ALSO THERE'S A VERY LARGE FUGITIVE TASK FORCE THAT\nOPERATED IN NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY THAT IS BASICALLY MADE UP\nOF ALL STATE, LOCAL AND FEDERAL AGENCIES, AND THEY GET CO-OPTED\nBY AGGTFs IN THIS. JUST THE INFORMATION WE HAD IN\nTHE PUBLIC, I KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN FAIRLY QUICKLY.\nTHERE WAS JUST SO MUCH INFORMATION THAT THEY PROBABLY\nGOT FROM THE DEVICE THAT DIDN'T EXPLODE THAT IT LED THEM TO THIS\nPARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL. AND, YOU KNOW, I KNOW THAT THIS\nARREST IS OVER, BUT I TRULY BELIEVE THERE IS DEFINITELY\nQUITE A FEW OTHERS INVOLVED IN THIS.\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT THE -- AND I TEND TO AGREE WITH ANTHONY MAY\nWHO WAS ON THE LAST BLOCK, THE ATF BOMB EXPERT, THAT YOU'VE GOT\nEIGHT PIPE BOMBS IN NEW JERSEY. TWO PRESSURE COOKERS.\nTHAT MEANS TO ME THAT THERE IS MORE THAN ONE BOMBMAKER INVOLVED\nHERE. BUT DEFINITELY MORE THAN ONE,\nMORE THAN TWO INDIVIDUALS INVOLVE IN THIS WHOLE THING.\nSO THEY ARE OUT RIGHT NOW BANGING THE STREETS LOOKING FOR\nA LOT MORE OTHER INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE INVOLVED IN THIS\nPARTICULAR BOMBING. BOTH IN NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY.\n>> AND WE'VE GOT A LOT OF INFORMATION COMING INTO US ALL\nAT THE SAME TIME HERE. YOU CAN SEE RIGHT ON THE SCREEN,\nWE ARE TOLD THE FIRST PICTURE OF THIS MAN, OF RAHAMI IN CUSTODY\nON A GURNEY BEING PUT INTO THE AMBULANCE, THIS OBVIOUSLY WOULD\nHAVE BEEN IN LINDEN, NEW JERSEY, AS THE SHOOT-OUT HAPPENED.\nJUST REALLY A SHORT TIME AGO AS HE WAS BEING TAKEN INTO CUSTODY.\nWHEN WE LOOK AT THIS, WE'LL BRING IN PAUL -- OH, I'M GOING\nTO CHECK MYSELF AND GO BACK DOWN TO THE MAYOR OF ELIZABETH WHERE\nTHE RAIDS WHERE THE LAST KNOWN MAN WAS TO LIVE.\nHE'S SPEAKING RIGHT NOW. >> I AM NOT INFORMED OF THEIR\nNAPES. I HAVE THE ELIZABETH POLICE\nCHIEF DIRECTOR TRYING TO CONTACT THE NYPD TO FIND THE NAMES OF\nTHE PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE AND WHERE THEY ARE FROM.\nIF THEY ARE FROM THE CITY OF ELIZABETH, THAT'S NOT CONFIRMED\nTO ME. I DO NOT KNOW WHO THEY ARE AT\nALL. >> Reporter: WERE YOU ALERT ODD\nOF A POSSIBLE TERRORIST CELL IN ELIZABETH?\n>> NO. THE FIRST TIME THIS HAPPENED WAS\nYESTERDAY AFTERNOON. THERE WAS WORD THAT CAME THROUGH\nTHAT THE NYPD WAS GOING THROUGH ELIZABETH REGARDING THE CHELSEA\nINCIDENT, BUT THERE WAS NO LOCATION OR NO BUSINESS OR NO\nSITE AT THAT TIME. AND THEN WE HAD OUR INCIDENT\nLAST EVENING AND EARLY MORNING AT WHICH TIME THE STOP OCCUR IN\nTHE VERRAZANO BRIDGE THAT LED TO THE SEARCH WARRANT HERE THIS\nMORNING. >> Reporter: CAN YOU JUST\nCOMMENT AGAIN ABOUT THE ARREST? >> MR. RAHAMI IS CURRENTLY UNDER\nARREST. THIS OCCURRED ON ELIZABETH\nAVENUE IN THE CITY OF LINDEN. AND ONE POLICE OFFICER IN THE\nCITY OF LINDEN WAS SHOT IN THE VEST AND ONE WAS SHOT IN THE\nHAND. MR. RAHAMI ALSO SUSTAINED SHOTS\nIN THE AMBULANCE THAT HAS TAKEN HIM AWAY.\n>> Reporter: WERE THEY CHASES HIM?\n>> I DON'T KNOW THE DETAILS. I JUST KNOW THE END RESULT AT\nTHIS TIME. >> Reporter: ARE THEY\nCHARACTERIZING THIS AS A SHOOT-OUT?\n>> I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T HAVE ANY DETAILS AND\nDON'T KNOW THE HOSPITAL. >> Reporter: WERE THERE ANY\nEXPLOSIVES FOUND IN THE HOUSE? >> BEHIND ME?\nTHE FBI HAS NOT REPORTED ME. I'M GETTING FULLY BRIEFED BY THE\nFBI AT 12:30 THIS AFTERNOON, WITH SENATOR MENENDEZ AND\nSENATOR BOOKER. >> Reporter: MAYOR, DID HE\nACTUALLY LIVE HERE? >> WE KNOW HE STAYED HERE.\nWHETHER THIS WAS HIS FULL-TIME ADDRESS, I DON'T KNOW AT THIS\nTIME. Z\n>> Reporter: HAVE YOU BEEN TOLD OF ANOTHER LOCATION?\n>> I HAVE NOT HEARD ABOUT ANOTHER LOCATION.\n>> Reporter: HAVE YOU HEARD IF HE HAS A SON?\n>> I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY OF THE OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS AT THIS\nTIME. >> ALL RIGHT.\nTHAT WAS JUST THE MAYOR OF ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY, CHRIS\nBULLWAGE, THE LATEST INFORMATION IS THAT AHMAD RAHAMI, WE GOT\nVIDEO OF THIS MAN CLEARLY AWAKE AND CONSCIOUS, BUT HE WAS AWAKE\nIN THE BACK OF THE AMBULANCE. LOOK AT HIM BEING WHEELED INTO\nTHE AMBULANCE HERE. WE SAW ANOTHER VIEW, THERE WE GO\nRIGHT THERE, HE'S AWAKE. HE'S CONSCIOUS.\nHE SURVIVED WHATEVER THE ENCOUNTER WAS WITH POLICE RIGHT\nTHERE. >> LET'S ACTUALLY JUMP DOWN TO\nDREW GRIFFIN ON THE SCENE CLOSE TO WHERE THIS ALL PLAYED TO IT\nIN LINDEN, NEW JERSEY. HE HAS A WITNESS THERE WITH HIM.\nDREW? >> Reporter: KATE, JUST BREAKING\nIN RIGHT NOW, WE'RE SPEAKING TO THE LOCAL POSTMAN ON HIS ROUTE\nTHIS MORNING WHEN THE SHOOTING TOOK PLACE.\nAND SIR, GO AHEAD AND DESCRIBE WHAT YOU HEARD.\nYOU HEARD FIRST TWO POPS. >> I HEARD TWO POPS FIRST.\n>> Reporter: IT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE GUNSHOTS?\n>> I THOUGHT IT WAS SOMETHING FALLING OFF THE BACK OF A TRUCK,\nLIKE A PALATE OR SOMETHING. >> Reporter: AND THEN WHAT?\n>> THEN I HEARD A VOICE FROM THE -- THERE WAS LAUNDRY DOWN\nTHERE, AND I HEARD SOMEBODY YELL, ARE YOU OKAY?\nAND THEY WERE LOOKING IN THE DIRECTION.\nAND AGAIN I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING ELSE.\nAND THEN I HEARD ANOTHER POP. MORE POPS.\nAND THEN IT KEPT GOING AND THAT IS WHEN I SAW THE POLICE\nVEHICLES. >> Reporter: HOW MANY SHOTS\nTOTAL ROUGHLY? >> MAYBE 12 TO 15.\n>> SO WOULD YOU DESCRIBE IT AS A SHOOT-OUT AS WHAT YOU HEARD?\n>> THAT'S WHAT IT SEEMED TO BE. IT SOUNDED LIKE THEY WERE\nSHOOTING AT SOMEBODY. AFTER THE INITIAL TWO SHOTS,\nTHERE WAS A BIT OF A SILENCE. THEN IT SOUNDED LIKE I HEARD\nMORE SHOTS AND LIKE THEY WERE IN PURSUIT OF SOMEBODY.\n>> Reporter: FOR THE REPORT, THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU HEARD, YOU\nDIDN'T SEE? >> I DIDN'T SEE THE SHOOTING,\nNO. >> Reporter: AND THE ADDRESS OR\nTHE LOCATION WHERE YOU CAME FROM?\nIS THIS SOMEBODY YOU HAD DELIVERED MAIL TO?\n>> YES, I GOT TO 700 DOWN AND SAW THE BULLET CASINGS ON THE\nSIDEWALK. >> Reporter: WHAT WAS THE\nBUSINESS? >> MURDY'S, A TAVERN.\n>> Reporter: WERE THEY CLOSED AT THIS TIME?\n>> YES, THEY ARE CLOSED. THE OWNER ACROSS THE STREET SAW\nMORE THAN I DID. HE KIND OF TOLD ME WHAT\nHAPPENED. >> Reporter: SO YOU BELIEVE THE\nGUN CASINGS WERE IN FRONT OF A CLOSED BAR.\n>> YES, THERE WAS ONE ON THE SIDE AND A PARTIAL FRAGMENT ALSO\nON THE SIDEWALK. HE SAW A MAN ASLEEP IN THE\nLITTLE ENTRANCE WAY IN THE VESTIBULE.\nAND I BELIEVE THAT'S WHEN THE POLICE -- I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY\nWHAT HAPPENED THEN, BUT I THINK THE POLICE SHOWED UP AT THAT\nPOINT. AND THAT'S WHEN THE GUN TIRE\nSTARTED. >> Reporter: KATE, THAT CONFORMS\nTO WHAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM OTHER WITNESSES, THAT THIS MAN WAS\nPOTENTIALLY ASLEEP IN THE VESTIBULE OF A BAR DOWN THE\nSTREET WHEN LINDEN POLICE RECOGNIZED HIM AS BEING THE\nSUSPECT. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY THE POSTMAN\nRECALLING WHAT HE HAD HEARD ON HIS ROUTE THIS MORNING.\nAND AS WE GET MORE INFORMATION FROM THIS SCENE, WE WILL\nCERTAINLY GET BACK TO YOU. >> AMAZINGLY QUICK POLICE IN\nLINDEN, NEW JERSEY. ANOTHER TOWN FROM ELIZABETH\nWHERE THE SUSPECT LIVED AND WHERE THE EXPLOSIONS HAVE TAKEN\nPLACE OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS. EVAN PEREZ IS HERE WITH NEW\nDETAILS ABOUT THIS MAN, AHMAD KAHN RAHAMI WHO WE BELIEVE IS IN\nCUSTODY. >> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT.\nTHE LOCAL MAYOR THERE SAYS THE FAMILY RAN A CHICKEN RESTAURANT\nIN ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY, THERE, RIGHT NEAR WHERE THE SCENE WHERE\nHE WAS JUST ARRESTED. AND ACCORDING TO THE MAYOR, THEY\nHAVE HAD SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE TOWN, CODE ENFORCEMENT ISSUES,\nTHE RESTAURANT WAS OPEN 24 HOURS FOR A PERIOD AND APPARENTLY THE\nNEIGHBORHOOD WAS UPSET WITH THE FAMILY.\nTHE FATHER RAN THE RESTAURANT WITH TWO SONS INCLUDING RAHAMI\nWHO YOU SEE THERE. WE BELIEVE, AGAIN, THAT HE IS\nNOW IN CUSTODY. THE FBI HAS NOT COME OUT\nOFFICIALLY TO ANNOUNCE THIS IS HM.\nTHEY ARE STILL GOING THROUGH THE PROCEDURES TO CONFIRM A POSITIVE\nIDENTIFICATION, BUT WE ARE TOLD BY SOURCES THAT'S HIM UNDER\nARREST. IT APPEARS FROM THE VIDEO WE'RE\nSHOWING THAT HE WAS SHOT OR HAS SOME KIND OF INJURY ON HIS RIGHT\nSHOULDER. AND THAT WOULD BE, THAT WOULD --\nTHAT WOULD FALL IN LINE WITH WHAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM\nWITNESSES, THAT THERE WAS SOME KIND OF SHOOT-OUT AND AN\nALTERCATION THERE BEFORE THEY ARRESTED HIM.\nONCE THEY IDENTIFIED WHO HE WAS YESTERDAY, THEY STARTED SITTING\nON THE RESTAURANT, THE HOME, THEY WERE SITTING THERE FOR\nSEVERAL HOURS TRYING TO SEE MOVEMENTS, TRYING TO SEE IF HE\nWAS TRYING TO GO ANYWHERE. THEY WERE HEARING OTHER\nSIGHTINGS THAT MIGHT BE HIM. SO THEY HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR\nTHIS GUY ALL OVER THE PLACE, ALL OVER IN NORTHERN NEW JERSEY,\nBEFORE THEY FINALLY PUT OUT THAT PICTURE TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT\nEVERYBODY KNEW THAT THAT'S WHO THE FBI WAS LOOKING FOR.\n>> AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT AND YOU MENTION IT, JUST HOW\nQUICKLY THINGS HAVE MOVED THIS MORNING.\nTHEY JUST PUT THAT LOOKOUT OUT JUST A COUPLE HOURS AGO.\nA ENNOW IN CUSTODY AS YOU SEE HIM AND CONSCIOUS BEING PUT INTO\nTHAT AMBULANCE. BOB BAYER, ON THAT EXACT POINT,\nTHEY NOW HAVE THIS MAN IN CUSTODY.\nHE IS BELIEVED TO BE CONNECTED TO ALL THREE OF THESE SITES, ALL\nTHREE OF THE BOMBING SITES WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT.\nWHAT KIND OF INFORMATION ARE YOU LOOKING TO GET FROM HIM RIGHT\nAWAY? >> A WIDER NETWORK, KATE.\nIT'S VERY IMPORTANT, HE MAY NOT HAVE ACTED ALONE.\nTHERE MAY BE ANOTHER STASH OF BOMBS.\nHE WAS PRETTY GOOD AT MAKING THESE BOMBS.\nTHEY WENT OFF, THEY WERE FAIRLY SOPHISTICATED.\nHE'S OBVIOUSLY PREPARED TO GET IN A SHOOT-OUT WITH POLICE.\nAND OFTEN HE WILL HAVE PATRIOTS THAT MAY BE OUT THERE AND THE\nPOLICE ARE STILL GOING TO THEIR META DATA, ALL HIS CONNECTIONS.\nTHEY ARE GOING TO WANT TO ASK HIM WHO ELSE IS INVOLVED.\nTHAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO KNOW RIGHT NOW.\nWHAT IS THE IMMINENT THREAT. THERE MAY BE NONE, BUT POLICE\nDON'T KNOW THAT YET. >> FIRST THING TO DO IS MAKE\nSURE THERE ISN'T ANYONE ELSE OUT THERE RIGHT NOW WHO COULD BE A\nTHREAT TO THE AREA. I WANT TO BRING IN OUR TERROR\nANALYST HERE, THE PROFILE OF SOMEONE LIKE THIS CONNECTED TO\nTHREE DOMESTIC BOMB SITES WITH TEN OR SO CRUDE OR IN SOME CASES\nMORE SOPHISTICATED EXPLOSIVE DEVICES, WHAT KIND OF PERSON,\nPAUL, IS THIS? AND HOW DOES THIS KIND OF PERSON\nFIT IN WITH WHAT THE INTERNATIONAL TERROR GROUPS LIKE\nISIS ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH? >> WE DON'T HAVE MANY ANSWERS\nYET ABOUT WHAT KIND OF PERSON THIS IS.\nINDEED, HIS MOTIVATION IN TRYING TO CARRY OUT THE THESE ATTACKS\nOR HOW HE WOULD BE CONNECTED BACK TO INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST\nGROUPS IF THERE'S A CONNECTION, IF FACT THAT HE WAS AFGHAN BORN\nCAME, CAME TO THE UNITED STATES, IT IS AN INTERESTING DATA POINT.\nTHAT, IF THERE IS SOME KIND OF INTERNATIONAL CONNECTION, MAY\nPOINT MORE TOWARDS THE PAKISTANI TALIBAN THAT DIRECTED THE TIMES\nSQUARE BOMBING BACK IN 2010. OR INDEED EVEN AL QAEDA.\nTHEY WILL BE TRYING TO TALK TO HIM, TRYING TO GET INFORMATION\nVERY QUICKLY TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY CO-CONSPIRATORS THAT WE\nKNOW. WE DON'T KNOW IF HE ACTED ALONE\nOR IF THERE WERE OTHERS. THAT POINT IS NOT CLEAR AND\nINVESTIGATORS DO NOT KNOW THAT YET.\nWE REALLY NEED TO SORT OF EMPHASIZE THAT TO OUR VIEWERS.\nAS SOMEBODY WHO IF HE WAS THE LONE ATTACKER WAS ABLE TO PUT\nTOGETHER RUDIMENTARY DEVICES. THESE WERE NOT POWERFUL HIGH\nEXPLOSIVE DEVICES. IF THIS WAS SOMEBODY WHO HAD\nTRAINING IN SYRIA OR IRAQ, HE COULD PUT TOGETHER A MUCH MORE\nPOWERFUL BOMB THAN HE DID. BUT EVEN THE DEVICE, HE WAS ABLE\nTO PUT TOGETHER IN THE PRESSURE COOKERS, COULD HAVE OBVIOUSLY\nKILLED PEOPLE. >> JUST TO BE CLEAR, WE DON'T\nKNOW IF THERE'S CONNECTION BETWEEN THIS MAN AND AN\nINTERNATIONAL TERROR OPERATION THAT OCCURRED AT ALL.\nWE DO KNOW HIS LAST KNOWN ADDRESS WAS IN ELIZABETH, NEW\nJERSEY. WE CONTINUE TO SHOW THIS AMAZING\nVIDEO OF HIM BEING PUT INTO THE AMBULANCE.\nJEAN CASAREZ IS THERE WHERE RAIDS HAVE BEEN HAPPENING\nOVERNIGHT THROUGH TODAY. JEAN, WHAT ARE YOU HEARING THERE\nNOW? >> Reporter: WELL, WE ARE ABOUT\nTHREE MILES FROM LINDEN, NEW JERSEY.\nWE ARE IN ELIZABETH JUST AS YOU SAID.\nI WANT TO SHOW YOU RIGHT BEHIND ME IS THE FIRST AMERICAN FRIED\nCHICKEN WHERE THE FBI HAS BEEN EXECUTING SEARCH WARRANTS SINCE\nTHE EARLY MORNING HOURS HERE. THEY ACTUALLY TOWED AWAY TWO\nCARS. THEY BROUGHT OUT AT LEAST ONE\nBOX OF EVIDENCE. AND I WAS ABLE TO CONFIRM WITH\nTHE MAYOR THAT THE RAHAMI FAMILY LIVES ATOP THAT FRIED CHICKEN\nRESTAURANT. AND THE FATHER AND THE TWO SONS\nOPERATED THE RESTAURANT. NOW, THE MAYOR OF ELIZABETH SAYS\nTHAT EVERYONE IN THIS VICINITY KNEW THE FAMILY.\nKNEW THE FAMILY BECAUSE HE SAID THERE WERE ISSUES WITH THE CITY,\nTHE NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE FAMILY. THEY USED TO RUN THIS RESTAURANT\nFOR 24 HOURS A DAY, WHICH THE MAYOR SAID VIOLATED CODE\nORDINANCES AND NOISE ORDINANCES. AND THE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS VERY\nUPSET BECAUSE IT WAS VERY LOUD AT NIGHT AND PEOPLE WOULD\nCONGREGATE IN THIS AREA. AND SO THEY WOULD GO TO CITY\nHALL MEETINGS AND JUST COMPLAIN ABOUT THE RESTAURANT AND THE\nFAMILY. WELL, THE FAMILY FOUGHT BACK AND\nTHEY ACTUALLY SUED THE CITY OF ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY.\nAND IN 2012, THE MAYOR SAYS THAT THE CITY WON THAT LAWSUIT.\nBUT THAT'S WHAT THE CITY IS KNOWN\nFOR AND SAYS THE CITY GOVERNMENT BELIEVES AND WE KNOW NOW RA HAM\nIS WANTED FOR QUESTIONS IN RELATION TO THE BOMBING ATTACK\nINSIDE THE BACKPACK AND HE BELIEVES BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT A\nMILE AWAY FROM HERE, JUST WANTED TO THROW AWAY EVIDENCE,\nALLEGEDLY, OF COURSE, NO ASSOCIATION OR EVEN DELINEATION\nAS A SUSPECT IN THIS, BUT WANTED TO THROW AWAY THE BOMBS, BECAUSE\nHE KNEW POLICE WERE TRYING TO COME AFTER HIM, BUT THERE WAS A\nBACKPACK DISCOVERED AT 9:30 LAST NIGHT ABOUT ONE MILE AWAY FROM\nHERE. HOMELESS PEOPLE, I HAVE\nCONFIRMED, ACTUALLY FOUND THAT BACKPACK FROM THE MAYOR.\nTHEY SAW THERE WAS PIPE AND ELECTRICAL WIRE.\nTHEY DROPPED IT, AND THEY RAN TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND TOLD\nTHE POLICE DEPARTMENT WHAT THEY FOUND, AND THAT LED TO THE BOMB\nSQUAD COMING IN. OF COURSE, ONE PART OF THAT BOMB\nWAS DETONATED BY ACCIDENT. IT'S NOW IN THE HANDS OF THE FBI\nTO BE SENT TO QUANTICO, VIRGINIA, FOR FORENSIC TESTING.\n>> JEAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH. ON THE SITE THERE.\nWE WELCOME VIEWERS IN THE UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE WORLD.\nIF YOU ARE JUST JOINING US, A LOT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST 51\nMINUTES. BIGGEST, MOST IMPORTANT HEADLINE\nHERE IS THAT THE SUSPECT THAT POLICE, AUTHORITIES, THE FBI,\nTHEY HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR. THE MAN NAMED AMMAD KHAN RAHAMI.\nTHERE IS CONFUSION ON HIS LAST NAME, HAS BEEN TAKEN INTO\nCUSTODY ACCORDING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS.\nYOU'RE SEEING THE MAN THEY BELIEVE IS THE SUSPECT PUT INTO\nAN AMBULANCE. THIS ALL HAPPENING.\nHE IS CONNECTED, AUTHORITIES SAY, TO ALL THREE OF THE BOMB\nSITES THAT HAS HAPPENED, AND, REALLY, HIT THE TRI-STATE AREA\nIN THE LAST 48 HOURS. >> TAKE A LOOK AT THAT PICTURE.\nCLEARLY YOU CAN SEE HE IS CONSCIOUS BEING LOADED INTO THAT\nAMBULANCE THERE. NEW INFORMATION ABOUT THE FINAL\nMOMENTS WHEN HE WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY IN LINDEN, NEW JERSEY.\nTHERE WAS A SHOOT-OUT. OUR REPORTER EVAN PEREZ THAT\nDETAILS ON THAT. >> Reporter: RIGHT.\nTHE MAYOR OF ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY IS SAYING APPARENTLY TWO\nOFFICERS SUSTAINED INJURIES DURING THIS GUNFIGHT THAT LED TO\nTHIS ARREST. ONE OFFICER HIT IN THE VEFST AN\nTHE SECOND OFFICER STRUCK IN THE HAND.\nIT APPEARS FROM THE VIDEO WE'RE SHOWING THAT RAHAMI SUSTAINED\nSOME TYPE OF INJURY, PERHAPS A GUNSHOT THERE ON HIS RIGHT\nSHOULDER AND, AGAIN, THE IM IMPORTANCE IS HE'S IN CUSTODY,\nTHE FBI CAN QUESTION HIM TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED\nHERE. WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE OTHER\nPEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE INVOLVED IN THESE ATTACKS AND WHETHER OR NOT\nHE IS THE BOMBMAKER. NOW, THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS\nWHAT JEAN CASAREZ WAS SHOWING THERE JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO.\nTHE SCENE OF THE FBI SEARCHING THAT HOME.\nTHE BELIEF IS THAT IF THERE WAS A BOMB LAB, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN\nIN HIS HOME. THE QUESTION IS, DID FAMILY\nMEMBERS SEE THIS? DID ANYBODY SEE WHAT HE WAS\nDOING? YOU CAN'T PUT TOGETHER THIS MANY\nPIPE BOMBS WITHOUT SOMEONE SEEING SOMETHING.\nTHAT'S THE BIG QUESTION THAT THE FBI AND CERTAINLY THE JOINT\nTERRORISM TASK FORCE IS GOING TO BE ASKING IN THE COMING HOURS.\nAS SOON AS THEY CAN STABILIZE HIM AND ARE ABLE TO QUESTION\nHIM. >> ONE IMPORTANT THING.\nONE IMPORTANT QUESTION WE'VE LOOKED AT HIS MORNING IS WHAT\nLED POLICE TO THIS MAN? HOW DID THEY PICK HIM UP?\nWE'RE GETTINGALI ALI LITTLE MOR INFORMATION WITH THAT.\nLET ME BRING YOU IN, ART RODERICK, ON THIS.\nI'LL READ IT, COMING FROM OUR PRODUCER.\nTHIS IS THE NEW REPORTING COMING OUT.\nPOLICE RESPONDED TODAY AFTER RECEIVING A TIP OF A SIGHTING OF\nBRAHIMI ACCORDING TO A LAW OFFICIAL AND THIS, FIRST\nIDENTIFIED SUNDAY AFTERNOON ACCORDING TO SENIOR LAW\nENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS, ABLE TO I.D. HIM THROUGH A FINGERPRINT,\nALSO THE CELL PHONE ON THE PRESSURE COOKER FOUND AT THE\n27th STREET LOCATION IN MANHATTAN.\nTHAT PROVIDED SOME CLUES. THAT IS THE -- THAT WAS THE\nUNDETONATED -- THE UNEXPLODED PRESSURE COOKER BOMB PICKED UP.\nART? >> YEAH.\nI THINK WE ALL ASSUME THAT WAS GOING TO BE THE KEY PIECE OF\nEVIDENCE, IS WHATEVER THEY COULD TAKE OFF THAT PHONE OR WHATEVER\nEVIDENCE THEY COULD PULL OFF THE TAPE AS FAR AS FINGERPRINTS.\nIT SEEMS TO ALL BE FALLING INTO PLACE RIGHT NOW, BUT WHEN YOU\nLOOK AT THIS IN TOTALITY, THERE SEEMS TO BE A CERTAIN LEVEL OF\nUNSOPHISTICATION, NOT ONLY IN THE BOMBMAKING AND PLACEMENT OF\nTHE BOMBS, BUT ALSO THE FACT THAT HE WAS SLEEPING IN A\nDOORWAY OF A BAR NEAR HIS HOME. SO I MEAN, THIS DOESN'T SEEM TO\nBE EXTREMELY WELL PLANNED AS WE THINK ABOUT HOW TERRORIST CELLS\nLIKE, OPERATE MAYBE IN EUROPE, IN THE MIDDLE EAST.\nSO I THINK WITH ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT WE KNOW AS THE\nPUBLIC, AND WHAT'S BEING PUT OUT FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCES,\nYOU KNOW, THE JTTF AND THE TASK FORCES THAT ARE OPERATING HAVE A\nTON MORE INFORMATION, AND THEY'RE JUST RUNNING THIS DOWN.\nI THINK OVER THE NEXT 24 TO 48 HOURS, WE COULD SEE A PRETTY\nGOOD WRAP-UP OF NOT ONLY WHAT HIS INVOLVEMENT WAS HERE, BUT\nALSO OTHER INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE INVOLVED.\n>> MAYBE NOT SOPHISTICATED, MAYBE NOT WELL PLANNED, BUT GOES\nTO SHOW WITHOUT SOPHISTICATION, EVEN WITH A LACK OF\nSOPHISTICATION, YOU CAN DO SOMETHING VERY, VERY DANGEROUS.\n>> STILL VERY DEADLY, YES. >> 29 INJURED.\nCOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH, MUCH WORSE.\nBOB BAIR, ONE SPECIFIC QUESTION FOR YOU.\nIF THIS MAN WAS IDENTIFIED -- YOU'RE LOOKING AT PICTURES OF\nHIM, AMMAD KHAN RAHAMI, LOADED INTO AN AMBULANCE, IDENTIFIED IN\nPART FROM A FINGERPRINT ON THIS UNEXPLODED BOMB, WOULD THEY HAVE\nHAD TO HAVE SOME RECORD OF HIS FI\nFINGERPRINT ON FILE? A PREVIOUS RECORD AND HAD THEIR\nEYE ON HIM FOR SOME REASON? >> NO.\nI DON'T THINK SO. I THINK WE WOULD HAVE FOUND THAT\nOUT IF HE HAD BEEN RADICALIZED ONLINE, ON AN FBI LIST, I THINK\nTHAT WOULD HAVE COME OUT BY NOW. I THINK JUST GOOD INVESTIGATIVE\nWORKS, GOT INTO THE CELL PHONE, THE SECOND DEVICE, THE PICTURE,\nONCE YOU GET INTO THAT KIND OF BETA BASS, AFTER AN ATTACK, THEY\nCAN RUN YOU DOWN QUICKLY. THE ATF, FBI AND POLICE HAVE\nDONE 0 WONDERFUL JOB. THISIC CANS INTO WORK AND YOU\nCAN'T GET AWAY. HE MADE BIG MISTAKES USING ANY\nCELL PHONES AT ALL, GETTING HIS PICTURE TAKEN BY CCTV CAMERA.\nI AGREE WITH ART. IT WASN'T VERY SOPHISTICATED AND\nSTILL LUCKY NO ONE WAS KILLED IN THESE TWO ATTACKS IN NEW JERSEY\nAND NSHG. >> ABSOLUTELY.\nNEW IMAGES OF THE SCENE OF RAHAMI ON THE GROUND CLEARLY\nSURROUNDED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. THIS HAPPENING IN LINDEN, NEW\nJERSEY. THIS IS ABOUT, YOU KNOW, JUST A\nFEW MINUTES FROM ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY, WHERE THESE RAIDS HAVE\nBEEN GOING ON. ARE HE WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY.\nAS WE LOOK AT THIS, PAUL, LET ME BRING YOU BACK IN.\nONE THING DREW GRIFFIN SAID HE HAD BEEN HEARING THAT STRUCK ME\nIS THAT IF THIS IS A SUSPECT, WHO IS ON THE RUN, WHOSE FACE IS\nALL OVER THE PLACE, AUTHORITIES HAVE PUT THIS OUT, WHO KNOWS\nWHAT CONNECTIONS THIS PERSON HAS, WHAT KIND OF CELL GROUP\nWE'RE LOOKING AT, THAT HE POSSIBLY WAS FOUND SLEEPING IN\nTHE VESTIBULE OF A BAR IN LINDEN, NEW JERSEY.\nSEEMS KIND OF BAFFLING TO ME. >> WELL, HE MAY HAVE BEEN ON THE\nMOVE. MAY HAVE NEEDED TO GET IN REST.\nBUT ONE GUY WHO'S BEEN IDENTIFIED AGAINST THE MIGHT OF\nU.S. LAW ENFORCEMENT AND EVERY SINGLE INTELLIGENCE AGENCY IN\nTHE UNITED STATES HAS GOT, IS NEVER GOING TO GET TOO MUCH TIME\nBEFORE THEY'RE GOING NORMALLY BE TAKEN INTO CUSTODY.\n>> AGAIN, EXTREMELY EFFICIENT, AND EXTREMELY QUICK THAT GOT HIM\nBETWEEN SATURDAY NIGHT AND SEWED.\nYOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY, THAT UNEXPLODED BOMB AND A CELL PHONE\nWITH FINGERPRINTS, CLUES TO WORK ON.\nNO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. PAUL, I'M STRUCK ALSO BY THE\nFACT THAT THIS GUY, IF HE DID MAKE ALL OF THESE EXPLOSIVE\nDEVICES, HE DID MAKE A NUMBER OF THEM, AND YOU CAN'T DO THAT IN\nONE NIGHT. I MEAN, IT TAKES SOME TIME.\nIT TAKES SOME PURCHASING. IT'S THE TYPE OF THING I IMAGINE\nSOMEONE ELSE MUST HAVE SEEN OR KNOW ABOUT OVER TIME?\nI IMAGINE THERE WILL BE A LOT OF QUEST\nQUESTIONING? >> POSSIBLY.\nDID OTHER PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT IT, THAT, IF HE WAS THE BOMBMAKER,\nCOULD THEY HAVE ALERTED AUTHORITIES?\nWE'LL HAVE TO FIND THAT ALL OUT AS WE LEARN MORE, BUT WE SAW IN\nTHE BOSTON ATTACKS IT'S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE\nSMALL NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS TO PUT TOGETHER PRESSURE COOKER\nBOMB INSTRUCTIONS. INFORMATION SAUL OVER THE\nINTERNET, IN THIS AREA, WE ALL LIVE IN THE NEW YORK CITY, NEW\nJERSEY AREA, TO BUY ALL THE COMPONENTS.\nTHESE WERE NOT VERY POWERFUL DEVICES.\nTHEY DIDN'T HAVE THE SIGNATURE OF WHAT ISIS TRAINED THEIR\nRECRUITS TO BUILD IN SYRIA AND IRAQ.\nTHEY'RE THE KIND OF DEVICES WE'VE SEEN IN EUROPE, WHICH WERE\nMUCH MORE POWERFUL, FOR EXAMPLE, AT BRUSSELS AIRPORT.\nTHIS MAY HAVE BEEN INSPIRED BY SOME KIND OF TERRORISM GROUP,\nBUT WE DON'T YET KNOW AND I GOT ON TO LINE.\nWE DON'T YET KNOW WHAT THE MOTIVATION WAS, BECAUSE WE\nHAVEN'T HEARD THIS GUY'S BACK STORY.\nWAS HE RADICALIZED AND SO ON AND SO FORTH.\nTHE ANSWERS WILL COME. >> WE KNOW HE WANTED TO HURT\nPEOPLE, BLOW THINGS UP AND HURT PEOPLE.\n2 THAT MUCH IS KNOWN.\n>> YOUR LAST THOUGHT ON THIS, YES, ONE MAYBE PHASE OF THIS,\nCHAPTER CONCLUDES, BUT STILL AN ENTIRE BOOK OF QUESTIONS LEFT.\nA SUSPECT IN CUSTODY BUT A WHOLE LOT WE DON'T KNOW.\n>> YES. EXACTLY.\nI MEAN, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT ETHNIC GROUP HE IS, FOR\nINSTANCE. IS HE SYMPATHIZING WITH A GROUP\nIN AFGHANISTAN, VERY LIKELY AT THIS POINT.\nWHETHER CONNECTED TO THE ISLAMIC STATE OR NOT REALLY DOESN'T\nMATTER, BUT HE WAS ALMOST UNDOUBTEDLY POLITICALLY\nMOTIVATED. WE HAVE TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF\nTHAT. >> ONE OTHER QUESTIONS LEFT.\nBOB BAIR, THANK YOU, CNN'S SPECIAL COVERAGE CONTINUES RIGHT\nNOW.",

THE MAYOR OF ELIZABETH, NEW\nJERSEY, TOLD ME THAT THE FAMILY LIVED ON THE UPPER FLOOR.\nTHIS MORNING WHILE THIS WAS HAPPENING HERE, THE FBI WAS\nEXECUTING A SEARCH WARRANT AT THEIR HOME.\nAT LEAST ONE BOX OF EVIDENCE, TWO CARS WERE TOWED AWAY.\nTHEY STAYED THERE FOR HOURS EXECUTING THAT SEARCH WARRANT.\nVERY IMPORTANT TO THEM. AND THEN I WILL TELL YOU THAT\nONE MILE AWAY FROM THE CHICKEN RESTAURANT IS WHERE THE BOMBS\nWERE DISCOVERED THIS MORNING A BACKPACK.\nIT WAS ACTUALLY 9:30 LAST NIGHT THAT TWO HOMELESS MEN, I AM TOLD\nBIT MAYOR OF ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY, WERE WALKING.\nTHEY FOUND THE BACKPACK IN THE TRASH CAN.\nTHEY TOOK IT OUT. THEY TOOK IT UNDER THE RAILROAD\nTRACKS. THEY OPENED IT UP AND THERE THEY\nSAW A PIPE AND WIRES. THESE TWO MEN, I WAS TOLD,\nLITERALLY RAN TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND TOLD THEM, THIS\nIS SOMETHING SERIOUS. AND THAT IS WHAT GOT THE BOMB\nSQUAD OUT. THAT IS HOW THEY DETONATED AT\nLEAST ONE, SECURED THE FIVE BOMBS THAT WERE IN THERE, SO NO\nONE WAS INJURED IN ALL OF THAT. THEY ARE NOW PACKAGED SECURELY\nAND WILL BE ON THEIR WAY AS POSSIBLY EVIDENCE IN A CRIMINAL\nTRIAL AGAINST THIS MAN THAT THEY JUST CAPTURED THIS MORNING.\nNO CHARGES YET, HOWEVER. BUT LAW ENFORCEMENT JUST SAID\nFEDERAL CHARGES MAY BE COMING. BROOKE?\n>> ALL RIGHT, JEAN CASAREZ IN LINDEN, THANK YOU, JEAN.\nNOW, THIS BOMBING SUSPECT WAS INJURED IN THAT SHOOTOUT WITH\nPOLICE. FOUR OTHER OFFICERS WERE ALSO\nHURT. ALL WERE RUSHED TO HOSPITALS FOR\nTREATMENT. LET'S GO TO CNN'S BRENDAN\nJOINING US FROM NEW JERSEY HOSPITAL WHERE THE SUSPECT WAS\nTAKEN. WHAT DO YOU KNOW?\n>> Reporter: WHAT WE'RE SEEING JUST OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL IS A\nHEAVY POLICE PRESENCE, WHICH WE'VE SEEN ALL OVER THE PLACE.\nOFFICERS STANDING HERE, MAKING SURE EVERY CAR THAT GOES INSIDE\nTHE CAR AT THE HOSPITAL IS CHECKED AND MADE SURE THEY'RE\nALLOWED TO BE IN THERE. THAT'S LIKELY BECAUSE RAHAMI IS\nHERE BEING TREATED FOR THOSE INJURIES.\nYOU SHOWED THAT VIDEO TO YOUR VIEWERS.\nWE KNOW HE SUSTAINED SOME SORT OF INJURY TO HIS SHOULDER.\nHE WAS ALERT AND SOMEWHAT TALKING WHEN HE WAS LOADED INTO\nTHAT AMBULANCE. AND THEN BROUGHT HERE TO THE\nHOSPITAL. SO, WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HIS\nCONDITION AT THIS POINT. WE DON'T KNOW IF HE'S EVEN\nTALKING TO AUTHORITIES AT THIS POINT, BUT UNDOUBTEDLY, FBI\nOFFICIALS ARE HERE AS PART OF THE INVESTIGATION.\nNOW LEADS THEM TO THE HOSPITAL WHERE HE'S BEING TREATED.\nWE ALSO KNOW AT THIS POINT THAT ONE OF THE OFFICERS THAT WAS\nINJURED IN THAT TAKEDOWN, AS JEAN JUST TALKED ABOUT IN NEARBY\nLINDEN, ONE OF THOSE OFFICERS IS ALSO BEING TREATED HERE AT THE\nHOSPITAL, NONLIFE-THREATENING INJURIES.\nTHAT'S GOOD. WE KNOW THE INJURIES SUSTAINED,\nONE OFFICER HIT IN A BULLETPROOF VEST.\nANOTHER OFFICER SHOT IN THE HAND.\nWE DON'T KNOW WHICH OFFICER IS HERE, BUT WE KNOW THIS IS ONE OF\nTHE HOSPITALS HE'S AT AS WELL AS ANOTHER HOSPITAL IN THIS AREA,\nBROOKE. >> BRYNN, THANK YOU SO MUCH IN\nNEWARK. NOW WE'RE LEARNING A LITTLE MORE\nABOUT THIS SUSPECT, ABOUT HIS FAMILY, ABOUT POTENTIAL LAWSUIT.\nI'VE GOT EVAN PEREZ HERE WITH ME HERE IN NEW YORK.\nOUR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT -- CAN WE FIRST PAUSE FOR A MOMENT JUST\nTO REFLECT ON EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED OVER THE PAST 24 TO 48\nHOURS. THIS RACE THAT, THANK GOODNESS,\nDIDN'T GO OFF, THE MARINE CORPS RACE RAISING MONEY SATURDAY\nMORNING. THE FACT THAT THIS ONE BOMB THAT\nDID GO OFF IN CHELSEA IN DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN ENDED UP IN A\nDUMPSTER, OR ELSE THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH WORSE.\n>> A LOT WORSE. INCREDIBLE SERIES OF LUCKY\nBREAKS, FRANKLY. THE FACT THAT THAT RACE STARTED\nLATE MEANT PEOPLE WEREN'T STANDING NEAR THAT GARBAGE CAN,\nWITNESSING, WAITING FOR RUNNERS TO GO BY, AND NOBODY GOT HURT\nWHEN THAT BLAST WENT OFF. THERE WERE THREE BOMBS IN THAT\nGARBAGE CAN. ONLY ONE OF THEM DETONATED.\nTHAT WAS ANOTHER STROKE OF LUCK. THEN YOU HAVE SATURDAY NIGHT IN\nCHELSEA, THE BOMB THAT DID EXPLODE ON 23rd STREET, IT\nHAPPENED TO BE UNDERNEATH -- PARD\nPARTIALLY UNDERNEATH A METAL DUMPSTER SO THE DUMPSTER TOOK A\nLOT OF THE HIT. 29 PEOPLE WERE INJURED, BUT\nLUCKILY NOT ANY SERIOUS INJURIES SIMPLY BECAUSE THE FORCE OF THE\nBLAST, EVEN THOUGH IT SHATTERED WINDOWS, DAMAGED CARS, THERE WAS\nA LOT OF DAMAGE DONE THERE, NOBODY DIED.\nAND THEN, OF COURSE, THE ONE ON 27th STREET, ACCORDING TO THE\nPRESS CONFERENCE THERE, THE INFORMATION THAT WAS GIVEN BY\nTHE FBI AND THE NYPD AT THAT PRESS CONFERENCE AT THE TOP OF\nTHE HOUR, THEY SAID THAT SOMEONE APPARENTLY DISTURBED THE DEVICE.\nIT WAS INSIDE A DUFFEL BAG. THAT'S A DUFFEL BAG THAT RAHAMI\nWAS SEEN PULLING ON 23rd STREET AS WELL AS 27th STREET IN\nSURVEILLANCE VIDEO. THEY APPEAR TO HAVE TAKEN THE\nDEVICE OUT OF THE BAG, AND THAT MIGHT HAVE DISTURBED IT AND\nCAUSED IT TO NOT GO OFF , BROOK. >> SOMEONE WHO OWNED A BAR IN\nLINDEN, NEW JERSEY, WHO FOUND THIS GUY ASLEEP INTO THE\nENTRYWAY OF THIS BAR, BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN WATCHING CNN ON HIS\nLAPTOP, CALLS POLICE, DOT, DOT, DOT, THE GUY GETS CAUGHT IN THE\nSHOOTOUT. AS FAR AS HIS BACKGROUND,\nRECORD, FAMILY, WHAT DO WE KNOW? >> WELL, HE'S AFGHAN BACKGROUND\nEMIGRANT FAMILY AS JEAN CASAREZ WAS TALKING ABOUT, THEY LIVED\nABOVE THIS CHICKEN RESTAURANT IN ELIZABETH, NJ NLG.\nIN 2011 THEY FILED A LAWSUIT BECAUSE THEY SAID THE TOWN AND\nTHE POLICE OFFICERS WERE HARASSING THEM WITH CODE\nVIOLATIONS. IT APPEARS THE LAWSUIT WENT\nNOWHERE, BUT THAT'S REALLY ABOUT THE EXTENT OF THE KIND OF\nTROUBLE THAT WE'VE SEEN WITH THIS FAMILY OR WITH THIS\nSUSPECT. WE DO KNOW THERE WERE A COUPLE\nMINOR BACKGROUND -- MINOR CRIMINAL ISSUES IN HIS\nBACKGROUND. THE POLICE TALKED ABOUT THAT AT\nTHE PRESS CONFERENCE AT THE TOP OF THE HOUR, BUT NOTHING MAJOR.\nNO SIGN OF HIM AT ALL ON THE FBI RADAR FOR RADICALIZATION.\nWE DO KNOW HE'S TRAVELED BACK TO AFGHANISTAN.\nWHENEVER HE CAME BACK INTO THE COUNTRY, HE WOULD BE\nINTERVIEWED. AGAIN, NOTHING AT ALL THAT CAME\nUP. >> THE QUESTION, ONE OF THE\nPRIMARY QUESTIONS, DID HE ACT ALONE?\n>> WELL, AT THIS POINT THEY DO BELIEVE HE ACTED ALONE.\nTHERE WAS SOME QUESTION, WE REPORTED EARLIER CERTAINLY FROM\nTALKING TO OFFICIALS, BECAUSE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE SEEN ON\nTHAT VIDEO HANDLING THE DEVICE THAT DIDN'T GO OFF, THERE WAS\nSOME FEAR THAT MAYBE OTHERS WERE INVOLVED.\nTHEY NOW BELIEVE THAT THOSE PEOPLE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH\nIT. THEY STILL HAVEN'T FOUND THEM.\nTHEY HAVEN'T TALKED TO THEM. THEY WANT TO TALK TO THOSE\nPEOPLE. THEY RIGHT NOW BELIEVE THIS MAN\nACTED ALONE. >> EVAN PEREZ, THANK YOU SO\nMUCH. WE'LL TALK AGAIN.\nA WITNESS TO THE SHOOTOUT THIS MORNING IS PUTTING ON A\nMICROPHONE RIGHT NOW. HE WILL JOIN ME LIVE TO TELL ME\nWHAT HE SAW THERE IN LINDEN TODAY.\nALSO AHEAD, NEW YORK ON HIGH ALERT AS WORLD LEADERS,\nINCLUDING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, ARE IN NEW YORK\nAT THE U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY. WE'LL TAKE YOU THERE AND TALK\nSECURITY. AND HILLARY CLINTON HOLDING A\nNEWS CONFERENCE, RESPONDING TO QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER\nTERRORISTS DID THIS TO INFLUENCE THE ELECTION.\nDO NOT MOVE. IT IS A BUSY MONDAY.\nYOU'RE WATCHING CNN.",

WE ARE GOING TO LOOK TO CLARIFY.\nI WANT TO REFER TO SOME REPORTING WE HAVE FROM OUR VERY\nOWN KATHERINE WHO IS REPORTING ON THIS SECOND TO NONE.\nSHE HAS INFORMATION ON WHAT HAPPENED TO MINNESOTA AS WELL AS\nTHE NEW YORK SUSPECT. LET'S START WITH THE NEW YORK\nSUSPECT FIRST BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT\nINFORMATION. ACCORDING TO HER FEDERAL LAW\nENFORCEMENT SOURCE, RAHAMI WAS NOT UNKNOWN, APPARENTLY THERE\nHAD BEEN PRIOR CONTACT WITH AUTHORITIES BUT HAPPENED SOME\nTIME AGO BUT WAS NOT RECENT. WE WILL GET MORE INFORMATION ON\nTHAT TIMELINE. WHAT RECENT IN ALL OF THIS MEANS\nWILL MATTER. SHE ALSO HAD ADDITIONAL SOURCE\nTHAT HE WAS NOT IN THE TERROR WATCH LIST.\nHERE IS WHAT WE ARE LEARNING FROM HER.\nDID THEY KNOW ABOUT RAHAMI AND THIS IS PERHAPS WHY WE WERE ABLE\nTO IDENTIFY THE SUSPECT AS EARLY AS LAW ENFORCEMENT WAS ABLE TO\nAFTER BREAKING NEWS ON SATURDAY. HERE WE ARE MONDAY MORNING.\nIT LOOKS LIKE HE IS IN CUSTODY. OF COURSE, WE WANT TO BE CAREFUL\nWITH THAT UNTIL WE GET CONFIRMATION FROM THE POLICE\nDEPARTMENT. NO THE MEANTIME, I WANT TO ADD\nTHIS, AS THERE'S ALL SORTS OF ALLEGATIONS BUT THERE'S ALL\nSORTS OF DESCRIPTIONS, WE DON'T KNOW IF HE'S LINKED TO ISIS OR\nANY ORGANIZATION AT THIS POINT. WE DO KNOW THAT ISIS IS CLAIMING\nRESPONSIBILITY IN MINNESOTA FOR THE STABBING ATTACKS THAT\nHAPPENED THERE AND ACCORDING TO KATHERINE, LAW ENFORCEMENT SAID\nTHAT THE SUSPECT WAS NOT ON THE FED'S RADAR WHICH IS AN\nINTERESTING TWIST AS WE SEE WHO THE GOVERNMENT IS AWARE OF AND\nWHO THEY'VE NOT AWARE OF. >> WAS HE POTENTIALLY\nSELF-RADICALIZED, IS HE PART OF OTHERS?\nTHERE WAS AN ARREST OF FIVE MEN POTENTIALLY HEAD TO GO JFK\nINTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. NEW JERSEY HAS BEEN A HOT BED OF\nRADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR, HIS FOLLOWERS SHOT FIRST RADICAL\nISLAMIST TERRORIST ATTACK IN THE UNITED STATES ON NOVEMBER 5TH,\n1990, THEY WENT ON THE BOMB THE WORLD TRADE CENTER IN '93,\nLANDMARK PLOT TO BOMB LANDMARKS IN NEW YORK CITY INCLUDING\nUNITED NATIONS AND ONE OF THE TANLS BEFORE THEY WERE\nPROSECUTED. THAT ALL HAPPENING IN THE SAME\nNORTHERN NEW JERSEY AREA FROM A MOSQUE IN NEWARK.\nTHAT RAISES MANY QUESTIONS WHETHER THERE'S BEEN TERROR PLOT\nPERHAPS AND RAMANI WAS POTENTIALLY ONE OF THE MEMBERS.\nJENNA: BIG QUESTION NOW, WHO IS HE WORKING WITH, IF ANYBODY.\nTHAT WILL ONLY TAKES US SO FAR. EXCELLENT JOURNALIST WITH\nBREAKING NEWS IS TELLING US AS WELL THAT MULTIPLE LAW\nENFORCEMENTS ARE TELLING HIM THAT THE SUSPECT IS, INDEED,\nCUSTODY AFTER THE SHOOTOUT WITH POLICE IN LINDEN, NEW JERSEY.\nI WANT TO TALK TO TOM JOSSLYN. TOM, YOU'LL BE FAMILIAR IS WITH\nTHE FOUNDATION FOR DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACIES SENIOR EDITOR WHICH\nIS AN EXCELLENT SOURCE AS WELL FOR ANYTHING TERROR RELATED.\nTOM, EVERYBODY IS LOOKING FOR CONNECTIONS, WHERE IS HE, WHERE\nDOES HE COME FROM? WHAT'S GOING TO YOUR HEAD AS YOU\nLISTENING TO THE NEWS AS THEY BREAK?\n>> UNTIL WE GET SPECIFIC DATA WE DON'T REALLY -- JENNA: DOES IT\nMATTER WHO HE IS CONNECTED TO IF HE WANTS TO KILL OR INJURY\nAMERICANS? >> I MEAN, IT DOESN'T MATTER IN\nTERMS OF THE END PROTECT OF TRYING TO KILL OR WOUND\nAMERICANS BUT MATTERS IN TERMS OF INVESTIGATING THE\nORGANIZATIONS POSSIBLE AT PLAY, FOR SURE.\nRAHAMI WAS WELL KNOWN TO FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT, YOU THINK SAN\nBERNARDINO, BOSTON BOMBERS, IN EACH CASE THERE WERE KNOWN\nSUSPECTS WHO CARRIED OUT ATTACKS, THEY WERE IDENTIFIED BY\nLAW ENFORCEMENT AS BEING THREAT BEFOREHAND AND WENT ONTO CARRY\nAN ATTACK. THEY SPEAK TO THE FACT THAT\nTHERE ARE MORE THREATS THAN EVER AND BASICALLY THE FBI ARE\nTRACKING MORE INDIVIDUALS THAN EVER, WHAT IT MEANS THAT THE\nLONE WOLVES GET THROUGH. JENNA: WE ARE LOOKING AT ANY\nPARALLELS BETWEEN ATTACKS, WE DON'T THINK THEY'RE CONNECTED\nBUT WE DO KNOW ABOUT RAHAMI THAT HE HAS REACHED TO AFGHANISTAN.\nWE KNEW ABOUT OMAR MATEEN AS WELL, CONNECTIONS TO AFGHANISTAN\nAND WHEN WE LOOK AT SAN BERNARDINO, THERE'S CONNECTIONS\nBACK TO AFGHANISTAN, PAKISTAN REGION AS WELL.\nWHAT DO YOU MAKE OF JUST THOSE TIES TO THAT PARTICULAR PART OF\nTHE WORLD, TOM? >> WELL, AFGHANISTAN AND\nPAKISTAN HAS BEEN THE EPICENTER BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS IT\nDOESN'T SURPRISE THAT IMMIGRANT, PEOPLE TIE TODAY THAT REGION ARE\nTIED TO JIHADI ETIOLOGY. THERE'S A LOT WE STILL HAVE TO\nLEARN ABOUT RAHAMI AND WHAT WENT DOWN BUT SHOULDN'T SURPRISE IF\nHE HAS TIES TO ORGANIZATIONS OVERSEAS.\nJENNA: CONNECTIONS ONLINE, WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD BY WAY OF\nCHATTER, WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN OVER THIS WEEKEND, NOT ONLY FROM WHAT\nWE ARE SEEING IN THE NEW YORK AREA BUT ATTACKS IN MINNESOTA?\n>> I THINK THERE'S A DIFFERENCE FROM THE CHATTER I HAVE SEEN IN\nNEW JERSEY, I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY SPECIFIC CLAIMS OF\nRESPONSIBILITY. THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN\nMINNESOTA, A MOCK NEWS AGENCY, CHIEF PROPAGANDA ARMS OF ISLAMIC\nSTATE, ISIS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT\nOPERATION AND SAID IT WAS A SOLDIER OF CALIPHATE THAT\nCARRIED IT OUT. WHEN THEY CLAIM SOMETHING,\nTHERE'S A LEAD THERE, A TIE THERE BACK TO THE MOTHERSHIP AND\nSO THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND.\nTHAT'S A BIG DISTINCTION. IN MINNESOTA WE HAVE A SPECIFIC\nCLAIM RESPONSIBILITY THAT NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED FURTHER BUT I\nWOULD SAY THE EVIDENCE OF THE PROBABILITY IS THERE'S MORE TO\nTHAT STORY. HERE WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR\nSUCH A CLAIM TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER OR NOT THIS GUY HAS TIED\nTO ORGANIZATION. JENNA: YOU JUST SAW REPORTER\nFROM ANOTHER STATION POP UP, WE ARE USING AS MUCH LIFE FEEDS WE\nCAN TO SHOW YOU OF THE SCENE AND PERHAPS CATCH ANYTHING OF WHAT\nUNFOLDED THERE. ACCORDING TO EYEWITNESS REPORTS,\nAGAIN, AN EYEWITNESS REPORTS NOTORIOUSLY UNRELIABLE BUT THEY\nGIVE US CONTEXT, PERHAPS OF WHAT HAPPENED ON THIS VERY STREET.\nTHAT THERE SHALL THERE WAS A MAN WALKING DOWN THE STREET WITH A\nGUN IN HIS HAND, A POLICE CAR PULLED UP NEXT TO THE MAN AND\nTHE MAN TOOK FOUR TO SIX SHOTS TO THE POLICE CAR.\nTHAT'S OUR FIRST ACCOUNT AS TO HOW MAYBE THE POLICE WERE ABLE\nTO FIND THE WITNESS, THE ALLEGED SUSPECT IN THE MANHATTAN-NEW\nJERSEY BOMBINGS. WE ARE GETTING CONFIRMATION THAT\nTHE SUSPECT IS IN CUSTODY AND WE ARE WORKING AS WELL TO GET\nIMAGES AND WHAT WE CAN TO SHOW YOU EXACTLY WHAT HAS TRANSPIRED\nIN A RAINY DAY IN NEW JERSEY, JUST IN THE NEIGHBORING TOWN\nFROM ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY WHERE RAHAMI LIVED.\nERIC, YOU HAVE MORE INFORMATION? >> THEY QUOTE, GOT HIM AND THEY\nSAY THE SUSPECT HAS BEEN SHOT IN THE SHOULDER AND THAT TWO POLICE\nOFFICERS HAD BEEN SHOT. ONE SAVED BY THE VEST,\nPOTENTIALLY ANOTHER ONE IN MORE SERIOUS CONDITION BUT WE DON'T\nHAVE ANY OTHER DETAILS ON THAT. JENNA: INTERESTING THAT HE WOULD\nBE WALKING DOWN THE STREET IF EYEWITNESS REPORT IS TRUE.\nAT LEAST A LOT MORE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS.\nTHAT'S WHAT WE HAVE NOW. MICHAEL IS BACK WITH US.\nFORMER HOMELAND SECURITY ADVISER.\nTHIS GUY IS PROBABLY KNOWN TO LAW ENFORCEMENT IF WE HAVE AN\nIMAGE AND A NAME SO QUICKLY. >> THAT'S RIGHT.\nTHAT INDICATES THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT WAS ABLE TO AT LEAST\nIDENTIFY HIM QUICKLY BASED UPON PRIOR INFORMATION.\nWE DON'T KNOW WHEN THAT SURVEILLANCE WAS.\nWE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT TOOK BUT THAT'S ONE OF THE KEY\nINDICATIONS BECAUSE OF THE SPEED AT WHICH THEY IDENTIFIED WHERE\nTHE INDIVIDUAL LIVED, THEIR BUSINESS AND WE WERE ABLE TO\nTRACK DOWN THIS VEHICLE WHICH WE ARE LEARNING MORE ABOUT AS IT\nWAS HEADING OVER HORIZONTAL BRIDGE, PERHAPS TO AIRPORT BUT\nHASN'T BEEN CONFIRMED, IN FACT, THEY DID HAVE MORE INFORMATION\nON THE INDIVIDUAL. SO NOW THE QUESTION IS WHERE DID\nHE GET THE GUN, WHERE WAS HE GOING, WHO WAS HE GOING TO TALK\nTO AND WHAT TYPE OF SUPPORT DID HE HAVE AND WHAT WAS THE NET\nWORTH OUTSIDE OF INDIVIDUALS? JENNA: ACCORDING TO REPORTS ON\nTHE GROUND, THIS IS THE BALANCE THAT HAS THE SUSPECT INSIDE.\nACCORDING TO WHAT WE ARE HEARING HE WAS B, INDEED, SHOT BY POLICE\nAND POLICE WERE ALSO WOUNDED IN ALL OF THIS.\nMICHAEL, IT'S IMPORTANT TO MENTION HE'S ALIVE.\nSO AT THIS POINT, NOW WHAT, WHEN DO INVESTIGATORS GET TO TALK TO\nAND ANSWER QUESTIONS THAT YOU'RE POSING AS WELL?\n>> OBVIOUSLY HE'S GOING TO HAVE HIS RIGHTS AND OPPORTUNITY TO\nHAVE COUNSEL. OBVIOUSLY READ MIRANDA RIGHTS\nAND TRY TO GET AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE.\nI HAVE TO TAKE A MOMENT WHAT AMAZING POLICE WORK THIS HAS\nBEEN TO HAVE THE EVENT ON SATURDAY AND THEN GO AND GET THE\nGUY, IF IN FACT, THIS IS THE GUY, RIGHT NOW MONDAY MORNING,\nTHAT'S AMAZING AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD REALLY\nTAKE OUR HATS OFF TO A COORDINATED MULTIAGENCY EFFORT\nHERE. THE JOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCE,\nCITY OF NEW YORK PD, NEW JERSEY, EVERYBODY WORKING TOGETHER.\nTHAT'S THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO WORK.\nJENNA: IT IS GREAT AND SO GRATEFUL FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT,\nMIELLAL, THIS IS INDEED THE CASE, WE CONCLUDE THE CHAPTER AS\nTO THE SUSPECT WHO ACTUALLY PLACED THE BOND IN THE EFFORT TO\nKILL -- TO KILL AMERICANS. >> THAT APPARENTLY IS THE\nSUSPECT RIGHT THERE. >> HE VERY MUCH RESEMBLES IN\nTERMS OF THE MUG SHOT. MAYBE WE CAN GET THE MUG SHOTS\nSO WE CAN COMPARE ON THIS TAPE. >> LOOKS LIKE IT'S MATCHING THE\nDESCRIPTION WE ARE RECEIVING FROM THE MAYOR'S OFFICE FROM\nEYEWITNESSES. HERE IT IS AGAIN TORGT TO AN\nEYEWITNESS THIS IS OUR FIRST DESCRIPTION OF WHAT HAPPENED, A\nMAN -- THIS MAN WAS WALKING DOWN THE STREET WITH A GUN AND\nSTOPPED BY POLICE AND ENGAGED THE POLICE, THERE WAS A SHOOTOUT\nTHAT TOOK PLACE, ONE OFFICER WAS SHOT, APPARENTLY SAVED BY HIS\nVEST, ANOTHER OFFICER WAS INJURED BY FRAGMENTS.\nBY THE WAY, WILL GET THE BEST TREATMENT AVAILABLE.\nWE WILL BE ALLOWED, OF COURSE, AS THE RIGHT OF EVERY AMERICAN\nTO GET REPRESENTATION. >> MICHAEL, DO YOU THINK HE'S\nGOING TO TALK? SO OFTEN TIMES THEY ARE SO\nDEDICATED, THEY ARE SO IN THE IDEOLOGY OF ISLAM, DO YOU THINK\nHE'S GOING TO GIVE UP ANYTHING OR KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT?\n>> OBVIOUSLY DEPENDING ON WHAT STATE OF MIND HE WAS.\nTHE FACT THAT HE WAS CARRYING A WEAPON, HE WAS LOOKING DEATH BY\nPOLICE OFFICER, DEATH BY COP, LOOKING TO PERHAPS END IT.\nNOBODY WALKS WITH A WEAPON AND DOESN'T EXPECT TO GET PICKED UP.\nTHAT'S PROBABLY THE STATE OF MIND THAT YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE A\nLOOK AT. WHAT INVESTIGATORS ARE GOING TO\nDO IS ISOLATE HIM AND TALK TO EVERYBODY AROUND HIM AND FIND\nLEVERAGE POINTS TO GET TO HIM. BUT THERE IS A LOT OF PRESSURE\nRIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE ARE OTHER CELLS OUT\nTHERE. JENNA: YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT\nTO COMPLEMENT LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE ARE SO GRATEFUL IF WHAT YOU\nARE ABLE TO SEE OR HEAR WHICH IS INCREDIBLE WORK OF MULTIPLE LAW\nENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. IT BEGS THE QUESTION ABOUT WHAT\nELSE, WHO IS NEXT? IF THIS GUY WAS, INDEED,\nWATCHED, WHY WEREN'T WE ABLE TO GET BEFORE HE PLACED THE BOMB IN\nNEW JERSEY AND BEFORE HE PLACED IT IN CHELSEA AND POTENTIALLY\nKILLED PEOPLE THERE, THANKFULLY NOBODY AT THAT TIME?\n>> JENNA, THAT IS ALWAYS A QUESTION THAT'S PRESENT NOW\nSINCE THE MISSION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS CHANGED.\nIT'S NO LONGER ABOUT INVESTIGATING AN ACT ARRESTING\nAN INDIVIDUAL AND BRINGING THEM TO JUSTICE, IT'S NOW ABOUT\nPREVENTING THE ACT BUT WE HAVE FOUND SO MUCH IS THAT\nINTELLIGENCE, YOU AND I TALKED ABOUT THIS IN MANY OCCASIONS,\nINTELLIGENCE IS NOT A SIGN IT'S AN ART FORM.\nPICK THE RIGHT ONE, WATCH THE RIGHT PERSON AND POUNCE ON THEM\nRIGHT BEFORE THEY'RE ABOUT TO DO THEIR ACT IS INCREDIBLY COMPLEX,\nDIFFICULT AND THIS IS THE PRESSURE THAT MEN AND WOMEN WHO\nWORK IN A JOINT TERRIFIC -- TERRORISM TASK FORCE, I WAS ON\nTHE LIR COMING INTO NEW YORK, LONG ISLAND RAILROAD AND\nEVERYBODY'S CELL PHONE WENT OFF WITH A BE ON THE LOOK OUT.\nJENNA: WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT? THAT'S THE FIRST WE HAVE SEEN\nSOMETHING LIKE THAT. >> ALERT SYSTEM SET UP WHERE\nTHEY ARE DOING DIGITIZED, BE ON THE LOOK OUT FOR.\nIT WAS AN AMAZING EVENT. EVERYBODY IN THE TRAIN CAR GOT\nIT. SOME PEOPLE RECOGNIZED ME, WHAT\nIS THIS, NOW THE ALERT THAT WE ARE GOING TO GET ON THE PHONES\nAND SO IT'S -- IT HAD THE INDIVIDUAL'S PICTURE.\nTHAT'S NOW THE KIND OF DIGITAL NET WE CAN THROW OVER TO TRY AND\nGET A SUSPECT AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.\n>> MICHAEL, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE FACT THAT VERY SIMILAR TO\nTHE TSARNAEV BROTHERS, ALLEGEDLY WALKING DOWN THE STREET BEFORE A\nSHOOTOUT. >> WHY DID THEY PICK THAT AREA,\nIT'S NOT ICONIC, IT WAS NOT -- A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE STREET BUT\nNOT CERTAINLY LIKE TIME SQUARE WOULD BE.\nTHAT INDICATES TO ME THEY WE WANTED TO ESCAPE BECAUSE THEY\nCOULD PUT DEVICE AND GET AWAY SAFELY BUT TO HAVE A WEAPON, HE\nFIGURED IT'S UP I MIGHT AS WELL GO OUT WITH A BLAZE OF GLORY.\n>> THE NUMBER OF BOMBS? >> THAT MEANS THAT THEY REALLY\nMEANT TO SPREAD THE CARNAGE AND LOOKING FOR SOFT SITES BUT IF,\nIN FACT, THE MARINE CORPS RUN IS IMPLICATED IN THIS, IT'S NOT\nBEEN CONFIRMED BUT THAT'S A PART OF THE PLAY BOOK THAT WE HAVE\nSEEN SINCE 9/11 OF TRYING TO -- >> THAT CERTAINLY SHOWS A\nPOTENTIAL MOTIVE GOING AFTER OUR MILITARY.\nWE ARE GOING TO THROW TO OUR COLLEAGUE WITH THE LATEST ON THE\nDEVELOPING STORY. >> THANKS, ERIC, JENNA, THE NEWS\nTHAT WE HAVE AT THIS HOUR COMING IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES UAHMED\nIS IN CUSTODY AFTER SHOOTOUT WITH POLICE.\nTHIS IS THE PICTURE OF THIS SUSPECT TAKEN INTO CUSTODY A\nSHORT TIME AGO IN NEARBY LINDEN, NEW JERSEY.\nAS YOU KNOW, THE AUTHORITIES HAD SENT OUT TEXT MESSAGES WITH ALL\nOF THESE PICTURES TO MILLIONS OF RESIDENTS IN THE AREA AND IT WAS\nAFTER THAT RELEASE OF THESE PICTURES THAT THE SUSPECT\nSOMEHOW CAME INTO CONTACT WITH POLICE.\nNOW, WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER POLICE APPROACHED HIM AND THERE\nWAS A SHOOTOUT, WHETHER HE RECOGNIZED POLICE IN THE AREA\nWHERE HE WAS AND BEGAN TO ENGAGE THOSE POLICE, BUT WE DO KNOW THE\nFOLLOWING FROM MULTIPLE REPORTING ON SCENE, MULTIPLE\nOFFICERS ENCOUNTERED THIS MAN. ONE OFFICER WAS SHOT, ACCORDING\nTO AUTHORITIES ON SEEN, THOUGH HE WAS WEARING A BULLET PROOF\nVEST. DETAIL OF INJURIES ARE NOT\nAVAILABLE TO US BUT WE DO KNOW THE BULLET PROOF WAS IN PLACE\nAND MAY HAVE BEEN IN -- OF HELP. AN EXPLOSION IN CHELSEA\nNEIGHBORHOOD OF NEW YORK CITY. THIS WAS IN THE EARLY TO MID\nEVENING HOURS THERE AROUND 23RD STREET SUBWAY STATION, SOME\nWHERE AROUND 26TH STREET, THERE WAS ONE EXPLOSION, THE ENTIRE\nAREA OFF AND A SHORT TIME LATER ANOTHER DEVICE FOUND INSIDE I\nBELIEVE A TRASH CAN SEEN WITH WIRES, ET CETERA, COMING OFF OF\nIT, IT APPEARED TO BE A PIPE BOMB.\nTHIS IS THE MAN WHO HAS BEEN BROUGHT INTO CUSTODY.\nTHIS IS HE ON THE STRETCHER, VIDEO OBTAINED BY FOX NEWS, HE\nHAS THEN BEEN TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL, LIVE NEWS CONFERENCE\nGOING ON ABC TELEVISION, THIS IS THE MAYOR OF LINDEN OF NEW\nJERSEY, LET'S LISTEN. >> WE WERE ABLE TO ACTUALLY TAKE\nHIM DOWN. >> IS HIS CAR DOWN THE STREET?\nI KNOW WE ARE A LITTLE BIT AWAY FROM WHERE THIS WAS GOING ON,\nEVERYBODY WAS LOOKING FOR HONDA 2003?\n>> OUR INVESTIGATION WAS TURNED TO THE FBI.\nTHEY ARE THE LEAD ON THIS. THE FBI IS THE LEAD ON THEM I'M\nSURE THEY'RE LOOKING TO ASPECTS OF THIS.\nI'M NOT PRIVY TO ANY DETAILS AT THIS POINT.\n>> HE WAS SHOT WHERE, THE ARM, THE LEG, I KNOW HE WAS HE WAS\nSHOT SEVERAL TIMES AND CONSCIOUS AND AWAKE ON THE GROUND, ONE\nSHOT IN THE LEG AND MAYBE A SHOT IN THE ARM BUT HE WAS CONSCIOUS\nAND AWAKE WHEN HE WAS TAKEN IN CUSTODY.\n>> THEY ARE WORKING ON CHARGES. >> MORE THAN ONE.\nWE DON'T KNOW THE NUMBER. >> WE DON'T KNOW THE NUMBER.\nSEVERAL SHOTS. >> AND THE OFFICERS ARE OKAY?\n>> THE OFFICERS APPEAR TO BE OKAY.\nWE HAD THREE OFFICERS WHO WERE TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL, ONE WITH\nBULLET FRAGMENT WHICH HIT HIM IN THE HEAD AND THE OTHER SHOT IN\nTHE VEST AND ONE OF OUR OFFICERS, I THINK, HE HAS HIGH\nBLOOD PRESSURE, HE'S BEEN EVALUATED AS WELL.\n>> FOR STRESS? >> YES, I WOULD SAY.\n>> TRAUMATIC EVENT, ABSOLUTELY. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH.\n>> ABOUT 10:30 THIS MORNING. WE HAD A GENTLEMAN THAT WAS\nSLEEPING IN THE DOORWAY OF A LOCAL BUSINESS, A BAR, THE CALL\nCAME IN FROM THE OWNER OF THE BAR WHO WAS OUTSIDE THE\nBUSINESS, OUR OFFICERS RESPOND TODAY CHECK OUT THIS PERSON.\nAT THAT POINT THE OFFICER WAS APPROACHING HIM AND TRYING TO\nROUSE HIM. THE OFFICER TOLD THE PERSON TO\nSHOW ME YOUR HANDS, THE GENTLEMAN HAD HIS HAND AND\nSOMETHING ON THE SIDE OF THE BODY AND PULLED OUT A HANDGUN\nAND FIRED A SHOT AT THE OFFICER STRIKING HIM IN THE ABDOMEN.\nTHEY WERE PREPARING HIM TO BE REMOVED FROM THE SCENE.\nLIKE I SAID, THE FBI WAS ON THE SCENE AND THEY'RE DOING THEIR\nINVESTIGATION. I'M SORRY?\n>> TO WHAT HOSPITAL? >> I DON'T KNOW, WE ARE JUST\nASSISTING THEM AT THIS POINT. >> THE GUN WAS RECOVERED?\n>> THE GUN THAT HE HAD? >> AS FAR AS I KNOW, YES.\n>> ANY OTHER WEAPONS OR BOMBS? >> NOT THAT I'M AWARE.\nIT'S A VERY ACTIVE CRIME SCENE. >> DO YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF GUN\nHE HAD? >> POSSIBLY AN AUTOMATIC\nHANDGUN. THAT'S ALL I KNOW.\nJUST LISTENING TO THE TRANSMISSION THAT IS HE WAS\nDISCHARGING WEAPON. THAT'S CORRECT.\n[INAUDIBLE] >> FIRING THE WEAPON, POSSIBLY\nAT PASSING VEHICLES. >> AND THE ONE THAT GOT SHOT IN\nTHE ABDOMEN OR CHEST -- >> THE ABDOMEN AREA.\n>> HE HAD HIS BULLET PROOF VEST ON SO SHAKEN UP BUT HE WILL BE\nOKAY. THE OTHER OFFICER SUSTAINED SOME\nTYPE OF INJURY TO FACIAL AREA SO WE ARE HOPING HE WILL BE OKAY\nAND THE THIRD OFFICER WAS COMPLAINING OF BLOOD PRESSURE\nISSUES SO HE WAS TRANSPORTED TO BE EVALUATED.\n>> WAS HE SLEEPING IN THE HONDA? >> I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT A\nHONDA, I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT A VEHICLE AT THIS POINT.\nI WAS TOLD HE WAS SLEEPING IN THE DOORWAY OF A LOCAL BUSINESS,\nTHAT'S ALL I KNOW. >> CAN WE GIVE THE NAME AND\nTITLE FOR THE RECORD? >> THE POLICE CAPTAIN AND MAYOR\nGIVING US NEWS AND WELCOME INFORMATION TODAY.\nIF YOU SEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING WORKED TODAY IN\nLINDEN, NEW JERSEY FOR THE GREATER TRI STATE AREA FOR\nLINDEN AND AMERICANS FROM COAST TO COAST, A RESTAURANT OWNER\nAPPARENTLY SAW A MAN SLEEPING ACCORDING TO WITNESSES OF THE\nAUTHORITIES YOU JUST HEARD SLEEPING IN THE DOORWAY OF SOME\nSORT OF BUILDING, HE NOTIFIED AUTHORITY THAT IS THERE WAS A\nSUSPICIOUS MAN THERE. THE AUTHORITIES ARRIVED, BEGAN\nTO APPROACH THEM AND APPEARED THAT HE HAD BEEN SLEEPING, WHEN\nHE RAISED THE HEAD HE BEGAN ACCORDING TO AUTHORITIES, MAYOR\nAND CHIEF BEGAN FIRING AT PASSING CARS, HE SAID, AND\nAUTHORITIES ENGAGED HIM.

WE ARE HAPPY THAT NONE OF OUR\nPOLICE OFFICERS ARE SERIOUSLY INJURED.\nWE ARE HAPPY THAT ALL OF THEM ARE GOING TO BE OKAY AND WE ARE\nHAPPY THAT THE SUSPECT HAS BEEN APPREHENDED.\n>> AS WE ALL ARE SO THANKFUL FOR THAT, HERE IS THE SUSPECT\nTHEY'VE TAKEN DOWN. MR. MAYOR YOU WERE SPEAKING A\nSHORT TIME AGO AND YOU WERE LISTENING AND THANK YOU FOR\nTHAT, ABOUT LOCAL RESIDENT OR BUSINESSMAN WHO WITNESSED THIS\nMAN APPARENTLY SLEEPING IN THE DOOR FRONT, COULD YOU TELL ME A\nLITTLE MORE ABOUT THAT AS FAR AS YOU KNOW IT?\n>> WELL, APPARENTLY HE WAS SLEEPING IN A LOCAL\nESTABLISHMENT. >> IS THAT A RESTAURANT, BAR OR\nSOMETHING? >> IT WAS A BAR, WHAT OCCUR WAS\nA CALL WAS MADE, ONE OF OUR POLICE OFFICERS WENT TO\nINVESTIGATE AND OUR POLICE OFFICER NOTICED ALMOST\nIMMEDIATELY THAT THIS WAS THE SUSPECT THAT WAS BEING WANTED\nFOR THE BOMBINGS, SO WHAT OCCURRED AT THAT POINT WAS HE\nWAS IMMEDIATELY SHOT AND OFFICERS RETURNED FIRE AND THIS\nINDIVIDUAL PROCEEDED TO GO WEST WARD ON --\n>> SO HE GOT UP AFTER BEING SHOT?\n>> YES, HE BEGAN FIRING AT OTHER VEHICLES AND HE DID STRIKE\nANOTHER POLICE OFFICER AND THAT OFFICER WAS INJURED FROM AND --\n>> KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT WEAPON HE MIGHT HAVE CARRIED OR\nDEMEANOR AS HE WENT WESTBOUND AS YOU MENTIONED?\n>> I CAN'T SAY HIS DEMEANOR, I WASN'T THERE.\nHE WAS SHOOTING ENDISCRIMNANTLY. I'M NOT SURE WHAT HE WAS HOPE TO\nGO ACCOMPLISH. >> TRYING TO GET AWAY.\n>> THERE WERE SEVERAL ROUNDS FIRED AND AGAIN WE ARE JUST\nTHANKFUL THAT NO ONE WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED.\nNONE OF OUR POLICE OFFICERS OR CITIZENS HERE IN TOWN.\n>> MR. MAYOR, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT AS A LONG-TIME NEW\nYORKER, HEARING THESE IF YOU SEE SOMETHING SAY SOMETHING AND\nREPORTED IMMEDIATELY WARNING, THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN SOMETHING\nTHAT WE SHOULD ALL TAKE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY IN DOING BY WAY\nOF EXAMPLE THIS MORNING COMING DOWN UP TO MIDTOWN WHERE I WORK.\nYOU KNOW, YOU'RE LOOKING AROUND. DO I SEE THIS GUY ANYWHERE AND\nIT APPEARS THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT A CITIZEN OF YOUR COMMUNITY DID\nAND MAY HAVE SAVED WHO THE HELL KNOWS WHAT.\n>> WELL, I THINK THE OWNER OF THE ESTABLISHMENT HAD NO IDEA\nWHO HE WAS. HE THOUGHT IT WAS VAGRANT WHO\nWAS SLEEPING IN ESTABLISHMENT. I THINK IT WAS THE POLICE\nOFFICER THAT REALIZED IMMEDIATELY WHEN HE WOKE THE\nINDIVIDUAL THAT THIS WAS THE SUSPECT WANTED IN THE BOMBINGS.\n>> DO YOU KNOW WHO THAT POLICE OFFICER IS AND UNDERSTAND THAT\nHE WAS WOUNDED SUPERFICIALLY AND FROM YOUR REPORTING HE'S GOING\nTO BE OKAY, DO YOU KNOW WHO HE IS AND WHETHER HE'S RECOUNTED\nDETAILS? >> HIS OKAY, ANGEL PADILLA.\nHE'S OKAY. THE OTHER OFFICER HAMMER AND THE\nOFFICER WITH THE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE IS OFFICER KAJANA.\nWE ARE THANKFUL IN LINDE, IN THAT NONE OF THE OFFICERS ARE\nSERIOUSLY INJURED AND THE SUSPECT HAS BEEN APPREHENDED.\n>> MR. MAYOR, DO YOU HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE -- WE KNOW ACCORDING\nTO AUTHORITIES LIVING NEARBY ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY, DO YOU\nHAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE, ANY DISCUSSIONS WITH ANYONE WHO HAVE\nSAID, YEAH, I HAVE SEEN THIS GUY AROUND OR WE KNEW SOMETHING\nABOUT HIM OR TO YOUR PARTICULAR COMMUNITY WAS HE A STRANGER FOR\nA LACK OF A BETTER WORD? >> HE WAS A COMPLETE STRANGER TO\nUS. TOTALLY OFF THE RADAR.\nAS MORE AND MORE INDIVIDUALS WHO ENGAGE IN THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR,\nMOST OF THEM ARE JUST TOTALLY AFTER THE RADAR, BUT AGAIN, IF\nYOU SEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING.\nIT SHOULD BE THE ORDER OF THE DAY FOR ALL OF OUR CITIZENS, IF\nYOU SEE ANYTHING OR SUSPECT ANYTHING, THE BEST THING TO DO\nTO LET SOMEBODY KNOW. >> THAT'S THE MAYOR OF LINDEN,\nNEW JERSEY, MR. MAYOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH.\n>> ARMSTED. >> MANY THANKS FROM ALL OF US\nWHO LIVE IN THE TRI STATES. I WANT TO GO THROUGH THE NAMES,\nOFFICER ANGEL PADILLA, ENCOUNTERED THE SUSPECT IN THE\nSTORE FRONT, THE BAR THERE AND IT WAS HE WHO AROUSED HIM OR\nROUSED HIM I SHOULD SAY AND THE MAN BEGAN FIRING.\nOFFICER PADILLA WAS INJURED. OFFICER PADILLA WHO RECOGNIZED\nHIM AS THE SUSPECT IN THE BOMBINGS AROUND THE TRI STATE\nBUT EVEN DURING THE SHOOTOUT HE WAS ABLE TO GET UP AND MOVE IN\nSOME WAY, RUNNING OR WALKING WHATEVER, WESTBOUND FROM THAT\nAREA WHERE HE ENCOUNTERED ANOTHER POLICE OFFICER, OFFICER\nHAMMAR AS HE WAS NAMED BY THE MAYOR AND OFFICER WHO ENGAGED\nHIM, HE RETURNED FIRE AND THERE WERE SOME WOUNDS TO OFFICER\nHAMMAR AND OFFICER KAJANO INVOLVED IN ALL OF THIS WHO HAD\nHIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, HUGE-STRESS RELATED TIME WOULD CAUSE\nSOMEBODY WITH HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE TO BE CHECKED.\nHE FELT STRESSED OUT AND THEY TOOK HIM, BUT THAT'S IT.\nTHE OFFICERS -- ALL OF THE OFFICERS INVOLVED, HEROS EACH\nONE, ABLE TO TAKE THIS MAN DOWN AND HE IS ALIVE AND THAT MAYBE\nTHE MOST IMPORTANT BIT OF THIS DAY.\nTHINK OF THE WEALTH OF INFORMATION THE MAN ON THE\nSTRETCHER MAY HAVE AVAILABLE TO THE JTTF, THE JOINT TERRORISM\nTASK FORCE IN NEW YORK AND SURROUNDING AREAS AND TERRORISM\nTASK FORCE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE AREA, WAS HE WORKING WITH\nSOMEONE, WAS HE TRYING TO GET A LARGER PLOT UNDERWAY, WHAT WERE\nHIS MOTIVES? IT'S ENDLESS, WE COULD GO\nTHROUGH THIS ALL DAY. NOW IT APPEAR THAT IS HE WILL\nSURVIVE FROM THE LOOKS OF THINGS HERE, YOU DECIDE, IT LOOKS LIKE\nHE WILL PROBABLY SURVIVE. YOU MAKE IT TO THE TRAUMA CENTER\nALIVE AND YOU USUALLY SURVIVE AND AUTHORITIES GET TO SPEAK\nWITH HIM AND MA MEANS THAT WE COULD KNOW AND THAT COULD BE\nINVALUABLE TO AUTHORITIES. RAHAMI'S FINGERPRINT HAS NOW\nBEEN FOUND ON THE UNEXPLODED DEVICE, THE SECOND OF TWO\nDEVICES IN MANHATTAN RECOVERED AFTER THE EXPLOSION IN CHELSEA\nAND SO TO THE DEGREE IT PROVIDES SERVITUDE, THEY ARE CERTAIN HE\nHANDLED DEVICE AND ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE SUSPECT WITH THE\nHELP OF A CELL PHONE LEFT BEHIND WITH THE PRESSURE COOKER FOUND\nONWET 27TH STREET. TO BACK UP, THERE WAS A BOMBING\nIN CHELSEA AND THEN A SECOND DEVICE FOUND WITH THE CELL PHONE\nATTACHED, REMEMBER, THEY BELIEVE THE FIRST DEVICE MAY HAVE BEEN\nDETONATED BY A CELL PHONE AND A SECOND DEVICE APPARENTLY HAD A\nCELL PHONE ATTACHED TO IT AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE\nDETONATION PROCESS FOR THAT. THAT CELL PHONE, THE SECOND CELL\nPHONE WHICH WAS FOUND ON WEST 27TH STREET, BLOCKS AWAY HAS\nBEEN IDENTIFIED AS HIS IN SOME WAY IDENTIFIED, THAT'S ACCORDING\nTO SOURCE TO ABC7 EYEWITNESS NEWS WHO HAS BEEN PROVIDING ALL\nOF THE PICTURES THIS MORNING. OUR OWN RICK IS LIVE IN CHELSEA\nWHERE ALL OF THIS BEGAN AND WORKING THROUGH THE WEEKEND,\nYOU'RE NOT GOING TO FIND A BIGGER DEVELOPMENT THAN THIS,\nRICK, THE THING LEFT OUTSTANDING IS AUTHORITIES SAID THIS MORNING\nTHAT HE MAY HAVE BEEN PART OF A GREATER CELL AND THAT NEEDS TO\nBE INVESTIGATED. >> ABSOLUTELY.\nREPORTS THAT AREN'T ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT THERE WERE OTHER\nSCENES ON SURVEILLANCE VIDEO PULLING A PLASTIC BAG OUT OF A\nDUFFLE BAG AND PLACING IT WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE THE SECOND\nPRESSURE BOMB. WE ARE ON 23RD AND CHELSEA, THIS\nBLOCK IS STILL SEALED OFF BY THE NYPD AND RECOVERY TEAM STILL\nBEHIND US WORKING THE CRIME SCENE AND THEY WILL BE\nPOTENTIALLY A COUPLE MORE DAYS COLLECTING EVIDENCE HERE AND\nHAVE BEEN ON 27TH, DON'T FORGET, THIS REALLY STARTED ON SATURDAY\nMORNING IN SEASIDE PARK NEW JERSEY, THAT'S WHERE THE FIRST\nBOMB WENT OFF, THERE WAS A PIPE BOMB IN A TRASH CAN.\nIT WENT OFF. THERE WERE OTHER PIPE BOMBS THAT\nDIDN'T DETONATE. THEY LATER HAD EXPLOSION ON\nSATURDAY NIGHT IN CHELSEA AND FOUND THIS WAS A PRESSURE\nCOOKER, SECOND PRESSURE COOKER DEVICE ON 27TH STREET AND I WAS\nTOLD ON SUNDAY THAT THEY VERY QUICKLY TIED ALL THREE OF THOSE\nDEVICES TOGETHER. THERE WAS UNEXPLODED ORDINANCE\nDOWN IN SEASIDE PARK NEW JERSEY AND 27TH STREET, THEY ALL HAD\nSIMILAR SIGNATURES AND TRIGGERED BY OR SUPPOSED TO BE TRIGGERED\nBY FLIP PHONE CELL PHONES AND OTHER SIGNATURES THAT WERE ABLE\nTO COLLECT THAT TOLD THEM, INVESTIGATORS TOLD ME THAT THEY\nKNEW WERE RELATED, ABLE TO TRACK THEM TO THE SUSPECT RAHAMI.\nHIS RESIDENCE SURROUNDED LAST NIGHT IN ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY,\nTHERE WAS ANOTHER EXPLOSION AT A TRAIN STATION IN ELIZABETH WHERE\nTHEY FOUND NUMEROUS PIPE BOMBS IN A BACK BACKPACK AND THAT MAY\nALSO BE CONNECTED TO THE SUSPECT, A HALF MILE FROM THE\nRESIDENCE. WHILE AUTHORITIES ARE\nSURROUNDING RESIDENCE, A COUPLE OF HOMELESS FOUND ANOTHER\nBACKPACK IN TRASH CAN AND THEY REALIZED THERE WAS WIRES\nSTICKING OUT OF IT AND ONE OF THE PIPE BOMBS IN THE BACKPACK\nDETONATE. AFTER ALL OF THAT, THEY PUT OUT\nA MASS ALERT, THEN THEY SEE HIM IN L IRK NDEN AND INVOLVED IN\nTHE SHOOTOUT AND CAUGHT. THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE\nQUICK WORK BY THE FBI COLLECTING EVIDENCE IDENTIFYING HIM AS THE\nSUSPECT AND THEN CITIZEN, SEEING A GUY, A STRANGER, YOU KNOW,\nTHEY WERE ABLE TO GET HIM AND THEY WERE ABLE TO GET HIM IN\nPART BECAUSE OF THE EXTENSIVE WORK DONE BY THE FBI AND LOCAL\nPOLICE. THEY GOT THE GUY BUT AS YOU\nMENTIONED, THE OTHER QUESTION IS WERE THERE OTHER PEOPLE\nINVOLVED, WORKING WITH HIM TO PULL THE DEVICE, DID THEY HELP\nHIM HERE, WE DON'T KNOW. >> FOR MORE CONTEXT, RICK, WE\nALL GOT NOTIFICATIONS LAST NIGHT FROM LOCAL POLICE AUTHORITIES\nAND OTHERS THAT AROUND THE BRIDGE WHICH IS ONE OF THE\nEXTREME BRIDGES ON THE OUTER SKIRTS OF NEW YORK CITY RIGHT BY\nTHE BELT PARKWAY WHICH MANY OF THE VIEWERS MAY HAVE REVERSED\nTHERE WAS AN INCIDENT WHERE A NUMBER OF MEN WERE BROUGHT INTO\nCUSTODY IN A VERY LARGE SET OF POLICE ACTIVITY LAST NIGHT AND\nSOME OF THOSE PEOPLE TAKEN INTO CUSTODY, DO WE KNOW IF THAT WAS\nRELATED IN ANYWAY? >> WELL, I WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS\nRELATED, THAT THE FBI WAS TRACKING THIS VEHICLE AND THEY\nPULLED OVER THIS SUV ON THE BELL PARKWAY BETWEEN STATEN ISLAND\nAND BROOKLYN, FIVE MEN WERE TAKEN INTO CUSTODY AND\nQUESTIONED, AND THEY WERE APPARENTLY TRACKING THE VEHICLE\nAND PULLED THEM OVER. I DON'T KNOW IF THE FBI WANTED\nINFORMATION RELEASED. IT MAY HAVE BEEN RELEASED\nPREMATURELY AND TIPPED OFF RAHAMI, THAT WE DON'T KNOW.\nWE WERE TOLD THAT THE INCIDENT WAS RELATE TODAY THIS.\nTHEY WERE QUESTIONING THE MEN IN CONNECTION WITH THE BOMBINGS\nHERE AND IN NEW JERSEY AND THAT'S WHY THEY STOPPED THAT\nVEHICLE. WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY\nDETERMINED WHETHER THEY WERE RELATE TODAY INCIDENTS HERE.\n>> LIVE AND ON SCENE. WE WILL GO BACK.\nIN JUST A MOMENT I WILL GET CAPTAIN HARRIS IN JUST A SECOND.\nI WANT TO GIVE YOU NEW INFORMATION, UNLESS ANYONE IS\nUNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THIS HAPPENED, YOU KNOW, PRETTY\nQUICKLY AND WITHOUT MUCH INCIDENT, I WANT TO SPELL THAT\nFOR YOU. THEY SAW -- THIS IS FROM THE\nAREA THERE WHERE ALL OF THIS WENT DOWN THIS MORNING.\nWITNESSES HAD REPORTED GUNFIRE IN ELIZABETH AVENUE.\nDON'T GET CONFUSED THERE'S ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY AND\nLINDEN, NEW JERSEY. THAT'S WHERE THEY SPOT IT HAD\nGUY AND WITNESSES SAY THEY SAW A CAR SPEEDING AND POLICE CARS\nAROUND THE CORNER AND THIS GUY ON THE GRAY CAR GOT OUT OF HIS\nCAR AND AT LEAST 30 SHOTS WITHIN SECONDS, WITNESSES SAY THIS WAS\nAFTER -- THEY FIRST ENCOUNTERED HIM IN THE DOORWAY OF A BUSINESS\nTHERE, HE GOT UP, THEY EXCHANGED AND GOT AWAY AND WENT WESTBOUND\nAND THAT WHERE WE PICK UP THE NEW INFORMATION FROM NEW YORK\nTIMES, WITHIN SECONDS OF THIS SHORT PURSUIT WITH POLICE,\nWITNESSES SAY THE MAN FELL TO THE PAVEMENT ALIVE BUT THE BODY\nSTILL SMOKING FROM THE SHOT, AGAIN, HIS BODY STILL SMOKING\nFROM THE SHOT, AT LEAST ONE POLICE OFFICER SEEMED TO HAVE\nBEEN WOUNDED TOO AND THAT MATCHES WHAT THE MAYOR TOLD US\nAS ONE POLICE OFFICER RECEIVED SOME WOUNDS BUT IT'S BEEN\nDETERMINED THAT HE WILL BE OKAY. QUOTING HERE A MAN NAME NICHOLAS\nPE\u00c3\u0091A, A MECHANIC AT LYNDON AUTO PARTS, AT FIRST IT WAS ONLY A\nFEW SHOTS BUT, QUOTE, THEN IT SOUNDED LIKE WAR.\nWE HAVE ALL BEEN HOLDING OUR BREATH BUT COMPLETELY SURREAL.\nTHE COPS WERE ALL OVER HIM, THE MANAGER AT THE SHOP.\nHE HAD NO WHERE TO GO. DIEGO JERONOMO, COUNTERTOP STORE\nON ELIZABETH AVENUE RIGHT THERE WHERE THIS HAPPENED SAID HE HAD\nSEEN A POLICE CAR PARKED ALONG THE AVENUE WITH THE POLICE\nOFFICER BACK TODAY HIM WITH THE GUN DRAWN SHOWING THE CAR AS A\nSHIELD AS SHOTS RANGED OUT. THE PICTURE OF ALL OF THIS CAME\nTOGETHER. THE MAN IS ASLEEP ON THE\nDOORSTEP, PROBABLY BEEN SLEEPING THROUGH NIGHT.\nA LOCAL BUSINESS OWNER CALLED A THERE IS A GUY SLEEPING HERE.\nCHECK IT OUT. A POLICE OFFICER FROM LINDEN\nNEW JERSEY NAMED OFFICER ANGEL PADILLA ARRIVED.\nSAW THE MAN IN THE DOORWAY. SAW THE MAN IN THE DOORWAY.\nREALIZED HE LOOKED LIKE THE SUSPECT.\nTOOK COVER LIKE ANY OFFICER WOULD.\nTHOUGHT TO BE ARMED AND DANGEROUS.\nUSED HIS CAR AS A SHIELD. YELLS AT HIM, WHATEVER HE DOES\nTO WAKE UP, THAT IS WHEN THE GUNFIRE ENSUED.\nTHAT IS WHEN HE TOOK SHOTS AT OFFICER PADILLA AND WAS HIT.\nHE HAS BEEN TREATED, GOING TO BE OKAY ACCORDING TO THE MAYOR\nTHERE. THE SUSPECT HERE.\nDOES THAT MEAN HE IS IN A CAR? SOUNDS LIKE WITNESS ACCOUNT.\nWITNESS OF THE POLICE SHOOTING IN LINDEN.\nSEAN STYLES IS WITH US. THE ASSISTANT MANAGER AT THAT\nLINDEN AUTO BODY SHOP. SHOULD SAY THE LINDEN AUTO BODY\nSHOP I WAS MENTIONING THERE. SIR, GOOD MORNING, GOOD\nAFTERNOON. TELL US WHAT YOU SAW THIS\nMORNING. >> IT WAS NORMAL DAY IN THE\nMORNING. WE WERE SITTING HERE.\nNEXT THING YOU KNOW WE'RE OUTSIDE, HEARD ONE SHOT RING\nOUT. THE SUSPECT WAS RIGHT AT THE\nCORNER HERE. SHEPARD: WHERE HE WAS SLEEPING\nTHERE. >> HEARD ONE SHOT RANG OUT.\nHEARD TWO SHOTS AFTERWARDS. POLICE OFFICER FIRED UPON HIM.\nLOOKS LIKE HE TOOK OFF RUNNING. I DON'T BELIEVE HE WAS IN A CAR.\nLOOKED LIKE HE WAS RUNNING ON FOOT.\nHE WENT DOWN A GOOD BLOCK 1/2. SAW A WHOLE BUNCH OF COP CARS\nFLY BY. 20 OR MORE SHOTS RANG OUT AND IT\nCAME TO A HALT. SHEPARD: YOU SAW WHAT APPEARED\nTO BE A END TO ALL OF THIS? IS THAT WHEN THEY TOOK HIM INTO\nCUSTODY OR HE FIRST TOOK OFF? >> I SAW HIM TOOK OFF RUNNING\nAFTER HE FIRED FIRST TWO SHOTS. SHEPARD: HE RAN WESTBOUND, HE\nDIDN'T GET IN A CAR. HE WAS ON FOOT?\n>> YES, HE WAS ON FOOT. SHEPARD: THAT COMPORTS WITH\nOTHER WITNESSES NEAR BY AS THEY WERE FOLLOWING POLICE AS THEY\nWERE FOLLOWING HIM. THERE WAS A SHOOTOUT AGAIN.\n>> PEGASUS THEY TOOK HIM DOWN. DOWN A BLOCK 1/2.\nSHEPARD: BLOCK 1/2 AWAY. ALL WITHIN WALKING DISTANCES\nWITHRIESDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD. >> CORRECT.\nSHEPARD: THIS LINDEN POLICE OFFICER, ANGEL PADILLA, HE DID\nHERO'S WORK. >> ABSOLUTELY.\nTHEY'RE ALL MAGNIFICENT. SHEPARD: THANKS SO MUCH FOR\nTHAT. I APPRECIATE\nACCOUNT. I WANT TO LET VIEWERS KNOW WE\nJUST GOT MORE FROM THE LINDEN MAYOR, DEREK ARMSTEAD, WHO HAD\nBEEN SPEAKING WITH US. HE SENT OUT INFORMATION TO\nCLARIFY. LINDEN RESIDENTS AVOID THESE\nSTREETS, ROZELLE AND LINDEN AVENUE SO THE AUTHORITIES\nCAN CONDUCT THEIR INVESTIGATION. PARENTS AND SCHOOLS HEALTHER IN\nPLACE. NOBODY LEAVE THE SCHOOL GROUNDS.\nTOUGH PROTECT THOSE KIDS. MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, ALL\nLINDEN POLICE OFFICERS ARE SAFE, SAYING I WILL KEEP YOU UPDATED.\nFOR A LITTLE BIT, WE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT HOW NEW YORK IS ON\nLOCKDOWN AND THERE ARE POLICE EVERYWHERE AND IMPOSSIBLE TO GET\nAROUND THAT WOULD BE NORMAL FOR THE U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY\nMEETING HERE. IT IS FURTHER HEIGHTENED AS A\nRESULT OF ALL OF THIS. BUT JUST FOR A LITTLE BIT OF\nCONTEXT WHERE ALL OF THIS HAS HAPPENED.\n27th STREET AND 24th STREET ARE THE TWO SORT OF\nLOCATIONS AROUND 7th AVENUE. THAT IS THE WEST SIDE OF\nMANHATTAN, WAY BELOW, WAY BELOW TIMES SQUARE.\nTO THE WEST OF, IF YOU EVER SHOPPED LIKE MACY'S AT HERALD\nSQUARE. THAT IS AT 34th STREET.\nNORTH OF THAT IN NEIGHBORHOOD CALLED CHELSEA, A LOT OF\nRESTAURANTS AND BARS, LARGELY GAY NEIGHBORHOOD FOR A LONG\nTIME. LIKE ALL GAY NEIGHBORHOODS, IT\nHAS SINCE NOW BECOME A STROLLER NEIGHBORHOOD, WITH GREAT ACCESS\nYOU WANT TO GO. YOU HEARD THEM MENTION THE PATH\nTRAIN. THE PORT AUTHORITY TRAIN THROUGH\nNEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY. GOES SOUTH OVER MANHATTAN AND\nGOES INTO NEW JERSEY AND PROVIDES TRANSPORTATION FOR\nHUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS IF NOT MILLIONS OF NEW JERSEYITES AS\nTHEY COME IN FOR THEIR COMMUTE. IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE ARE\nTWO MAJOR SUBWAY LINES, F AND M. THEY GO UP TO SIXTH AVENUE AND\nOVER TO LOWER BROCK LYNN AND QUEENS ON EITHER END --\nBROOKLYN. DIRECTLY ABOVE WHERE THE\nSHOOTING HAPPENED, THAT IS THE N LINE, N AND R.\nNEVER AND RARELY AS THEY CALL IT AS THOSE SUBWAY TRAINS ARE\nSOMETIMES A LITTLE HE SLOW. THE N OR NEVER TRAIN HAS, IS\nEXPERIENCING DELAYS TODAY. UP AND DOWN 7th AND\n8th AVENUE THAT IS N TRAIN, THE ORANGE TRAIN.\nTHERE ARE DELAYS. REST OF THE CITY UP\n6th AVENUE WHERE ALL THIS HAPPENED.\nHEART OF CHELSEA. 1, 2, AND 3 LINES TAKE PEOPLE UP\nINTO THE WEST SIDE AND UPPER MANHATTAN.\nEVERYTHING IS UP AND RUNNING. NOT TO SAY THERE AREN'T DELAYS.\nTHERE ARE DELAYS ON SIXTH AVENUE WHICH IS CLOSED AND WHEREVER THE\nSHOOTINGS HAPPENED, THE BOMBINGS HAVE HAPPENED.\nCERTAINLY THERE ARE DELAYS IN NEW JERSEY AND THERE ARE\nSHUTDOWNS -- BUT MY OVERRIDING POINT HERE, NEW YORK IS OPEN FOR\nBUSINESS. IF YOU WERE TO COME INTO THIS\nCITY TODAY, FLY INTO LAGUARDIA OR NEWARK LIBERTY OR INTO JFK\nINTERNATIONAL AIRPORT OR SOMEWHERE ELSE AND COME IN FOR\nBUSINESS MEETINGS YOU WOULD NOTICE A HUSTLING, BUSTLING,\nMID-SEPTEMBER RAINY MONDAY MORNING IN THE CITY.\nIT WOULD IN THE SEEM OUT. ORDINARY.\nTHERE ARE FORCES OF ARMED POLICE.\nTHERE ARE NATIONAL GUARD AND PEOPLE OF THAT NATURE.\nWE'RE ACCUSTOMED TO SEE THAT AT PORTS OF ENTRY AND POINTS OF\nMOVEMENT. SO WHEN ALL OF OUR MASSIVE\nSUBWAY AND TRAIN STATIONS IN THE PORT AUTHORITY TERMINAL, WHICH\nTAKES THOUSANDS OF BUSES INTO AND OUT OF THE CITY PER DAY,\nALONG OUR BRIDGES AND OUR TUNNELS.\nTHE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE, HOLLAND TUNNEL, LINCOLN DUNN\nNELL INTO NEW JERSEY. THERE IS ENHANCED POLICE\nPRESENCE THERE. NEW YORKERS SAW POLICE ON SUBWAY\nSYSTEMS RIDING TRAINS WITH RESIDENTS.\nAT TRAIN STATION ENTRANCES, SEARCHING BAGS\nINDISCRIMMINANTLY. DURING TIMES THEY FELT WAS RIGHT\nAND DOING THAT IN SUBWAYS ESPECIALLY WHERE THEY BELIEVE\nTHE MAN USED THE PATH TRAIN TO COME IN AND OUT OF THE CITY TO\nPLACE THESE BOMBS. THEY WERE ON HEIGHTENED ALERT.\nHEIGHTENED ALERT ALL OVER THE CITY.\nNEW YORK CITY IS UP AND RUNNING. AND MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE TODAY\nHAS BEEN A BUNCH OF NOTHING. THE M TRAIN AND F TRAIN THAT I\nUSED TO GET TO WORK ARE SLOW AND IMPERFECT AND THEY GOT ME HERE\nSLOWLY AND IMPERFECTLY JUST AS I EXPECTED.\nSO THE CITY IS NORMAL, IN THE MIDST OF WHAT IS CLEARLY CHAOS\nBUT THAT IS TRIBUTE TO NEW YORKERS UP AND DOWN AND\nACROSS ALL THE BORDERS, BOROUGHS AND CERTAINLY OUR FRIENDS AND\nNEIGHBORS OVER IN NEW JERSEY. THIS THING IS ON TRACK.\nNEW YORK CITY CAN HANDLE THIS, IF YOU SEE SOMETHING, SAY\nSOMETHING WORKS. AND WE ARE NOT AFRAID.\nWAS NOT ONE BIT AFRAID TO GET IN THAT SUBWAY SYSTEM THIS MORNING.\nGOT SO MANY CALLS AND LETTERS, CALLS AND EMAILS FROM FRIENDS\nWHO KNOW I LIVE IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD, WHO KNOW, WHO\nCALLED ON SATURDAY, THANKFULLY I WAS WATCHING REBELS PLAYING\nFOOTBALL. SAYING ARE YOU OKAY, ARE YOU\nOKAY? ARE YOU AFRAID?\nNO, I AM NOT AFRAID. I DON'T KNOW ANYONE WHO IS\nAFRAID. NOT ONE EMPLOYEE OF DOZENS AND\nDOZENS I WORK WITH, FRANKLY LIVE IN NEW JERSEY, WHO USE THE SAME\nSUBWAY LINES AND TUNNELS, NOT ONE OF THEM WAS LATE TODAY OR\nABSENT TODAY. WE CAN HANDLE THIS IN NEW YORK\nAND NEW JERSEY. WE GOT YOU.\nCATHERINE HERRIDGE IS IN WASHINGTON.\nTHERE IS A LOT OF INVESTIGATING TO BE DONE.\nCOULD THIS BE PART OF A LARGER TERROR CELL.\nWE'RE FIELD IT COULD BE, CATHERINE.\nDO YOU KNOW WHY THEY SAID THAT OR OUT OF ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION\nOR SOME EVIDENCE? REPORTER: THEY'RE TRYING TO\nUNDERSTAND WHAT THE INDIVIDUALS ASSOCIATIONS ARE, BASED ON THE\nEVIDENCE TO DATE AND HOW EVENTS UNFOLDED WE WERE TOLD LATE\nYESTERDAY IT DID APPEAR IT WAS OPERATION OF MORE THAN ONE\nINDIVIDUAL. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THERE IS AN\nEXTREMELY TIGHT LID ON INFORMATION FROM THE FEDERAL\nAGENCIES HERE IN WASHINGTON AND THIS IS REALLY A REFLECTION HOW\nSERIOUS THE SITUATION HAS BEEN AND CONTINUES TO BE.\nTWO SOURCES CONFIRMED TO FOX NEWS THAT RAHAMI WAS\nIDENTIFIED IN THE SURVEILLANCE VIDEO FROM THE EXPLOSIONS\nSATURDAY NIGHT IN NEW YORK CITY. AND THAT TWO OTHER INDIVIDUALS\nOF INTEREST WERE ALSO SEEN IN THAT VIDEO.\nFORENSIC REVIEW IS NOW BEING DONE ON THE DEVICES.\nONE THAT WAS RECOVERED AT THE SANE WHICH DID NOT EXPLODE.\nA PRESSURE COOKER BOMB. WHAT WAS LEFT OF THE DEVICE THAT\nDID EXPLODE. WE WERE TOLD BY TWO INDEPENDENT\nSOURCES THAT THE WAY THE BOMBS WERE MADE, THE COMPONENTS, THE\nEXPLOSIVES, THE SHRAPNEL, THE METHOD OF DETONATION, ALL\nSUGGESTED THAT THEY WERE MADE BY THE SAME INDIVIDUAL AND THAT THE\nDEVICES THAT WERE RECOVERED IN NEW JERSEY AT THAT 5-K RACE ALSO\nBORE SOME SIMILARITIES. SO WE WERE NOT ABLE TO GET MORE\nDETAIL AS TO WHAT THE CONNECTION WAS.\nWHAT HAS JUMPED OUT AT US IN OUR REPORTING THIS MORNING BASED ON\nTWO SOURCES IS THAT RAHAMI WAS NOT UNKNOWN TO AUTHORITIES.\nTHERE HAD BEEN SOME PRIOR CONTACT WITH AUTHORITIES WE WERE\nTOLD. IT WAS NOT RECENT AND WAS SOME\nTIME AGO AND WHERE PEOPLE GOT A LITTLE SQUIRRELY WHETHER IT WAS\nLOCAL, STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT OR WHETHER IN FACT IT MAY HAVE BEEN\nTHE FBI BUT HE WAS NOT AN UNKNOWN.\nBASED ON MY EXPERIENCE, THIS IS A HUGE DEVELOPMENT TO CAPTURE\nHIM ALIVE. WHAT WOULD TYPICALLY HAPPEN NOW\nIS SEARCH WHAT THEY CALL THE POCKET LITTER, THE KIND OF\nINFORMATION LITERALLY IN HIS POCKET AND ON HIS PHONE AS TO\nHIS OTHER CONTACTS. HIS SOCIAL MEDIA AND WHETHER\nTHIS SPEAKS IN IN WAY TO MOTIVES.\nSO IT'S A MAJOR DEVELOPMENT TO TAKE DOWN SOMEONE.\nBUT IF THERE ARE OTHERS INVOLVED THAT CAN BE THE CATALYST TO MORE\nACTION BECAUSE THE PLOT HAS BEEN DISRUPTED, SHEP.\nSHEPARD: WHAT? CATHERINE, ONE MORE THING.\nREPORTER: SURE. SHEPARD: YOU'VE BEEN ON THIS\nSTUFF SINCE THE BOMBING BACK IN '93.\nWHERE DO YOU SEE THIS? CONTEXTUALIZE THIS, GIVE US\nPERSPECTIVE. IS THIS ONE OF THOSE IN YOUR\nMIND, IS THIS ONE OF THOSE INCIDENTS ALL OF US WILL HAVE TO\nDEAL WITH? THERE ARE GOING TO BE PEOPLE\nHELL-BENT AND DETERMINED TO CAUSE PROBLEMS.\nMAY NOT BE ALL THAT ORGANIZED ACCORDING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT I'M\nREADING. DIDN'T MAKE ATTEMPTS TO COVER\nFINGERPRINTS OR WEAR GLOVES. DIDN'T LOOK LIKE TO AUTHORITIES\nHE WAS NOT TRYING TO GET CAUGHT. IS THIS ONE OF THOSE GUYS WE'RE\nGOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH OR IS THERE SOMETHING MORE HERE?\nREPORTER: SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY TOLD ME IN AN INTERVIEW\nYOU CAN LOOK AT ANY GIVEN THREAT PICTURE AND SAY NOTHING WAS\nSPECIFIC OR CREDIBLE WHICH THE THREAT PICTURE WAS LEADING UP\nUNTIL THE WEEKEND EVENTS. YOU CAN'T HANG YOUR HEAD\nANYMORE. WHAT IS HAPPENING UNDERNEATH THE\nRADAR DUE TO ENCRYPTION AND ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DISRUPT.\nTHE PERSON WHO WILL DISRUPT IT PERHAPS A PERSON ON THE STREET\nOR THE LOCAL COP. WHAT I WOULD TELL YOU FOR SOME\nCONTEXT THERE REALLY IS A GROWING PRIVATE DISCUSSION AMONG\nOFFICIALS WHO WORK IN THE COUNTERTERRORISM AREA ABOUT A\nDISCUSSION ABOUT THE LEVEL OF RISK THAT AMERICANS WOULD NEED\nTO BE WILLING TO ACCEPT IN THE FUTURE.\nWHAT I MEAN BY THAT THERE IS REALLY NO SUCH THING AS PERFECT\nSECURITY. IF YOU WANT TO MAINTAIN FREEDOMS\nWE HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY WHICH SO MANY OF US ENJOY WE HAVE TO\nACCEPT A CERTAIN LEVEL OF RISK BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T WANT THE\nGOVERNMENT IN ALL OF THEIR STUFF SO TO SPEAK.\nJUST BASED ON THE FACTS SO FAR, I DON'T WANT TO GET TOO FAR\nAHEAD OF IT, BUT THIS DOES SPEAK TO SOMEONE WHO WAS RADICALIZED\nIN SOME WAY, DECIDED TO ACT. MAY HAVE HAD SOME SORT OF\nSUPPORT FOR THEIR OPERATION. IF HE WAS IN FACT THE\nBOMB-MAKER. MAY HAVE PULLED THE INSTRUCTIONS\nFROM THESE MANUALS ONLINE.",

DOCTORS TREATING HIM ALONG WITH\nTHE OFFICERS HE'S ACCUSED OF WOUNDING.\nTHEY'RE ALL AT UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL IN NEWARK, NEW JERSEY,\nAND WE ARE LIVE THERE. WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE\nWOUNDED OFFICERS FIRST? >> Reporter: THESE TWO OFFICERS\nDO NOT HAVE LIFE THREATENING INJURIES.\nWE'RE TOLD THEY'RE BOTH GOING TO BE OKAY, BUT THIS COULD HAVE\nBEEN A VERY TRAGIC SHOOTOUT THAT TOOK PLACE ON THE STREETS OF\nLINDEN, NEW JERSEY. THAT'S ABOUT 15 MILES FROM HERE.\nA SHORT TIME AGO THE UNION COUNTY PROSECUTOR DESCRIBED THE\nINJURIES OF THE TWO OFFICERS. LISTEN.\n>> ONE OFFICER WAS STRUCK IN THE ABDOMEN INTO HIS BULLET PROOF\nVEST. THE OTHER HAD GLASS THAT STRUCK\nHIS FOREHEAD BUT NOT INTO HIS SKULL.\n>> Reporter: WE'RE TOLD THAT A COUPLE OF OTHER OFFICERS ALSO\nRECEIVED MEDICAL TREATMENT. THEY WERE TREATED FOR HIGH BLOOD\nPRESSURE. THEY ALSO GOT A THOROUGH\nCHECKUP, AND ONE OTHER THING WORTH NOTING, A SOURCE TELLS US\nNOW THAT THE SUSPECT IS LIKELY TO BE CHARGED WITH ATTEMPTED\nMURDER IN UNION COUNTY, NEW JERSEY IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nFIRING ON THOSE TWO OFFICERS. >> THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE.\nWHAT IS HIS CONDITION, THE SUSPECT, IF YOU KNOW?\n>> Reporter: ACCORDING TO THE UNION COUNTY PROSECUTOR, AGAIN,\nHE WAS SHOT IN THE LEG. SHE SAID SHE BELIEVES HE'S\nUNDERGOING SURGERY. THERE ARE REPORTS, AND YOU'VE\nSEEN IT IF YOU'VE SEEN THIS VIDEOTAPE, IT APPEARS HE WAS\nBANDAGED ON THE SHOULDER. WE DON'T KNOW THE EXTENT OF THE\nINJURY. AND LASTLY, AS YOU MENTIONED,\nTHERE IS JUST A BIT OF IRONY HERE THAT IN THIS HOSPITAL OF\n500, IT SEEMS NOW THAT ONE PATIENT, THAT BEING THE SUSPECT,\nRAHAMI IS NOW ACCUSED OF KILLING TWO OF THE OTHER PATIENTS HERE,\nTHE TWO POLICE OFFICERS WHO WE, AGAIN, ARE TOLD ARE GOING TO BE\nOKAY. >> THANK YOU.\nDONALD TRUMP TODAY SUGGESTED LAW ENFORCEMENT SHOULD RACIALLY\nPROFILE ARAB MEN THE SAME SAY ISRAEL BECAUSE.\nTHE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE MADE THE COMMENT ON THIS NETWORK IN\nRESPONSE TO THE TERROR INCIDENTS IN NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY.\nWE ARE IN FLORIDA SOUTH OF FORT MYERS.\nLARGELY A RETIREMENT AREA, NOT ENTIRELY, PROBABLY LEANS RIGHT.\nWHAT DO YOU KNOW, JOHN? >> Reporter: A LOT OF PEOPLE\nHERE. IT'S STANDING ROOM ONLY.\nNEWT GINGRICH ARRIVED A SHORT TIME AGO SHAKING HANDS WITH THE\nCROWD. THIS IS A HEAVILY RETIREMENT\nAREA, BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE HERE AS WELL TODAY.\nDONALD TRUMP, WHEN HE SAID THIS MORNING ON \"FOX AND FRIENDS\"\nSAYING MAYBE WE NEED TO ADOPT RACIAL PROFILING TO TRY TO ROOT\nOUT TERRORISM, THIS IS SOMETHING HE'S SAID MANY MANY TIMES OVER\nTHE COURSE OF THE PRIMARY CAMPAIGN.\nI THINK THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE GENERAL ELECTION, BUT HE\nBELIEVES THE COUNTRY IS TOO POLITICALLY CORRECT WHEN IT\nCOMES TO GOING AFTER TERRORIST. EVEN THOUGH RACIAL PROFILING IS\nUNCONSTITUTIONAL, HE THINKS WE MIGHT HAVE TO RESORT IT.\nAND HE DISMISSES THAT IT DOESN'T WORK, POINTING TO THE SUCCESS\nISRAEL HAS HAD WITH THE OPEN RACIAL PROFILING.\n>> ISRAEL HAS DONE AN UNBELIEVABLE JOB, AND THEY\nPROFILE. THEY SAY SOMEBODY SUSPICIOUS,\nTHEY'LL PROFILE AND TAKE THAT PERSON AND CHECK OUT, DO WE HAVE\nA CHOICE? LOOK WHAT'S GOING ON.\nDO WE HAVE A CHOICE? WE'RE TRYING TO BE SO\nPOLITICALLY CORRECT IN OUR COUNTRY, AND THIS IS ONLY GOING\nTO GET WORSE. >> Reporter: DONALD TRUMP IS\nGOING TO PUT TERRORISM FRONT AND CENTER AT THIS RALLY.\nHE'S GOING TO GO AFTER HILLARY CLINTON AND BARACK OBAMA ON A\nNUMBER OF FRONTS. JUST IN FROM HILLARY CLINTON,\nHIS CAMPAIGN RHETORIC IS GIVING AID AND COMFORT TO THE ENEMY\nWHICH WOULD AMOUNT TO FREEZEN. ALSO THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS WE'RE\nIN THE BATTLE FOR THE NARRATIVE WITH ISIS AS OPPOSED TO A WAR\nWITH TERRORISM, AND THE FACT THAT IT WAS DISCOVERED THIS\nMORNING, 858 PEOPLE WERE SLATED FOR DEPORTATION AND INSTEAD WERE\nGIVEN AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP. A LOT FOR DONALD TRUMP TO CHEW\nOVER THIS AFTERNOON, AND TONIGHT HE'LL BE MEETING WITH EGYPT'S\nPRESIDENT, A CONVERSATION WHICH WILL BE DOMINATED BY TERRORISM.\n>> AND THE RALLY WILL START IN A FEW MINUTES.\nAS WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THE WIDE SHOT OF THE PLACE, A LITTLE\nMORE ON THE BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN CLINTON AND TRUMP.\nIT'S OF NOTE. SECRETARY CLINTON SAYS WHAT THEY\nWANT -- WHAT THEY HAVE SAID THEY WANT, THE TERRORISTS THEMSELVES\nSAY THEY WANT IN THEIR OWN PUBLICATIONS, IF THEIR OWN\nRHETORIC, WHAT THEY SAY TO US IS WE WANT THIS TO BE A RELIGIOUS\nWAR. BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THEY CAN\nWIN THE RELIGIOUS WAR. NOW, THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT\nFIGHT WJS RELIGIOUS WARS. THIS IS NOT A RELIGIOUS WAR.\nTHIS IS A WAR AGAINST PEOPLE WHO HAVE, AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT, OR AS\nAN ASIDE, TAKEN THE MANTRA OF THIS RELIGION USING SOME OF THE\nTOOLS TO CARRY OUT THIS JIHADI, THIS TAKEOVER OF LAND, THIS\nTAKEOVER OF PEOPLE, THIS RECLAMATION OF AN ENTIRE REGION.\nTHEY WANT IT TO BE A RELIGIOUS WAR.\nWE WANT IT NOT TO BE A RELIGIOUS WAR, BECAUSE IF IT'S A RELIGIOUS\nWAR, THEY'RE GOING TO WIN IT. AMONG OTHER THINGS, WE DON'T SEE\nTHIS AS A RELIGIOUS WAR. DONALD TRUMP, HOWEVER, SEE THIS\nIS DIFFERENTLY. HE SEES YOU NEED TO PROFILE THE\nIS.7 BILLION MUSLIMS AS THEY COME IN THE COUNTRY, AND AS JOHN\nROBERTS PUT IT, YOU CAN'T, BECAUSE, WELL, THE CONSTITUTION.\nHE SAYS WHAT CHOICE DO WE HAVE IN WELL, WE HAVE A CHOICE NOT TO\nDO THAT. THIS PARTICULAR MAN WHO IS\nRESPONSIBLE FOR TODAY'S ACTIVITIES, ACCORDING TO JOINT\nTERRORISM TASK FORCE, THAT'S AN AMERICAN CITIZEN, AND HE'D BEEN\nLIVING HERE. HE WAS NOT ON A WATCH LIST OR\nANYTHING. WAS ABLE TO TRAVEL TO AND FROM\nAFGHANISTAN. IS THERE MORE THEY COULD HAVE\nDONE? CLEARLY, THEY COULD HAVE DONE\nSOMETHING,ERE MORE? WE DON'T KNOW.\nDONALD TRUMP WILL GET INTO MORE THIS AS HIS RALLY BEGINS IN A\nLITTLE WHILE. HE AND HILLARY CLINTON ARE OUT\nFOR HEARTS AND MINDS, I SUPPOSE. A GOOD MONDAY AFTERNOON.\nSUSPECT IN CUSTODY. TERROR ALERT, WELL, LOWER THAN\nIT WAS A LITTLE WHILE AGO, AND THAT'S GOOD.\nSTAY WITH US.",

HE'S OF AFGHAN DESCENT,\nNATURALIZED IN THE UNITED STATES.\nLIVING WITH HIS FAMILY IN NEW JERSEY.\nNEIGHBORS SAY HE WORKED AT A CHICKEN RESTAURANT OWNED BY THE\nFAMILY.

REPORTER: INVESTIGATORS ARE\nSAYING THERE IS GOING TO BE MORE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THIS.\nTHEY ARE STILL LOOK FOR MORE PEOPLE.\nWE HAVE VIDEO OF WHAT COULD BE TWO PEOPLE GETTING INTO THAT BAG\nYOU MENTIONED. THAT BOMB FOUR BLOCKS THAT\nDIDN'T GO OFF. TWO PEOPLE GOT THAT BAG, SO\nTHAT'S AT LEAST 6. IT COULD BE A CELL OR A NETWORK.\nBUT WITH THE U.N. IN TOWN, RAHAMI IS SOMEBODY THEY WANT TO\nGET CAUGHT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. BILL: THANKS, ROB.\nMARTHA: JOINING US NOW IS RETIRED NAVY LIEUTENANT\nCOMMANDER STEVE ROGERS.

IT SEEMS MUTED IN SOME WAYS.\nYOU WONDER IF WE ARE JUST GETTING USED TO THIS.\n>> WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS A COORDINATED WAR BEING WAGED\nAGAINST THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE BEEN ATTACKED BEFORE.\nBUT THIS SEEMS LIKE A COORDINATED ATTEMPT TO STRIKE AT\nUS. THIS IS SOMETHING WE FEARED.\nBUT WE KNEW AT SOME POINT IN TIME IT WOULD HAPPEN.\nLET'S TALK ABOUT THAT RESPONSE. THE RESPONSE EXTRAORDINARY.\nNO QUESTION ABOUT IT. RESPONSE FROM THE PUBLIC.\nWE SAY IF YOU SEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING.\nMOST OF THESE LEADS HAVE BEEN GIVEN BY PEOPLE MONTH WHO SAW\nSOMETHING AND SAID SOMETHING. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE RESPONSE\nFROM THE WHITE HOUSE. HE HASN'T SPOKEN TO GOVERNOR\nCUOMO YET, I DON'T KNOW IF HE TALKED TO GOVERNOR CHRISTIE.\nSOME OF OUR NATIONAL REPRESENTATIVES CAN'T COME TO\nGRIPS WITH THE FACT THIS IS A TERRORIST ATTACK.\nWE ARE SEEING A WAR BEING WAGED AGAINST THIS COUNTRY AND OUR\nLEADERS NEED TO STEP UP. MARTHA: THIS DEVICE COULD BE A\nFLOWN WOLF. I READ AT STATEMENT PUT OUT IN\nONE OF THE ISIS PUBLIC RELATIONS FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD\nMISSIVE WHICH SAYS IF YOU CAN'T COME HERE, YOU HAVE TO DO\nSOMETHING AT HOME. WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT TO TIE\nTHIS TO SOMETHING THAT IS LARGER THAN POTENTIALLY ONE CRAZY GUY\nAND RELATIVES IN NEW JERSEY. >> WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE WHAT WE\nCALL HUMAN INTELLIGENCE TO GET THAT INFORMATION OUT OF\nSOMEBODY, YOU DON'T KNOW.

THESE ARE COMING CLOSER\nAND CLOSER TO OUR ELECTION. IT APPEARS THEY MAY BE TARGETING\nOUR ELECTION TO DISRUPT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THIS COUNTRY\nIN NOVEMBER.

EVERYBODY WATCHING ARE SAYING\nHOW COULD IT NOT BE CONNECTED? IT'S OBVIOUS.\n>> THOSE OF US WHO MADE A CAREER OUT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND\nINTELLIGENCE. WE KNEW RIGHT AWAY.\nYOU HAVE A COOKER PRESSURE. THEN AND BOMB ON 23rd.\nTHEN IT'S AN UNKNOWN FACTOR, THE INCIDENT IN MINNESOTA.\nTHE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, WE ARE AT WAR AND WE START -- WE\nBETTER START FIGHTING THIS AS A WAR.\nMARTHA: IN TERMS OF THE DEVICES, SIMILAR TO WHAT WE SAW AND\nCONSTRUCTION AND ANYBODY'S ABILITY TO MAKE IT?\n>> THE PRESSURE COOKER. YOU CAN GET ON THE INTERNET AND\nLEARN HOW TO MAKE THESE DEVICES OFF ANY INTERNET-TYPE ENTITY.\nBUT WHAT WE HAVE IS THE COORDINATION OF THIS ATTACK.\nTHIS IS A WELL-COORDINATED ATTACK.\nMY CONCERN IS THERE ARE MORE OUT THERE.\nTHEY HAVE GOT TO GET THIS GUY. IN REGARDS TO THE SEARCH WARRANT\nEXECUTED THIS MORNING. THE TIMING IS INTERESTING.\nBUT THE STOP THE POLICE MADE LAST NIGHT, IT SEEMS TO ME THEY\nDID GET SOME CRITICAL INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION THAT\nALLOWED THEM TO GET ENOUGH PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THE JUDGE TO\nAGREE TO A SEARCH WARRANT. THAT WAS GOOD POLICE WORK.\nMARTHA: AND GOOD CIVILIAN WORK, THE GUISE WHO SPOTTED THE\nBACKPACK IN THE GARBAGE CAN. EVERYBODY HAS TO BE SO HYPER\nALERT. >> IF YOU SEE THIS GUY OR ANYONE\nYOU THINK IS INVOLVED IN TERRORISM, DO NOT TAKE THE LAW\nINTO YOUR OWN HANDS. THESE ARE DANGEROUS PEOPLE.\nTHEY MAY END UP MARTYRING THEMSELVES.\nMARTHA: YOU KNOW IN BOSTON, THE TSARNAEV BROTHERS, THE F.B.I.\nPUT THEIR PICTURES UP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nBILL: THE NATION ON EDGE. WHAT IS THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING\nSO FAR.

RIGHT NOW RAHAMI AT THE\nHOSPITAL. ACHT A NEWARK HOSPITAL ALONG\nWITH ONE OTHER OFFICER INVOLVED IN THAT SHOOT-OUT.\nANOTHER OFFICER TAKEN TO A SEPARATE HOSPITAL.\nAS YOU CAN SEE I'M AT THE EPICENTER WHERE THE\nINVESTIGATION IS FOCUSED IN ON ON WEST 23rd STREET WHERE THAT\nEXPLOSION HAPPENED. WE'VE SEEN ALL MORNING THIS\nINVESTIGATION IS FAR FROM OVER. WE'VE SEEN FBI EVIDENCE RESPONSE\nTEAM HERE AND THEY ARE STILL FOCUSED IN ON THIS AREA.\nTHERE IS A LOT TO GLEAN YET FROM WHAT EXACTLY RAHAMI'S INTENTIONS\nWERE. WAS HE WORKING WITH ANYONE ELSE?\nAND DOES HE, IN FACT, HAVE TIES TO INTERNATIONAL TERROR GROUPS\nOR ANYTHING ELSE? DID HE TRAVEL OVERSEAS?\nALL THE QUESTIONS THAT INVESTIGATORS WILL BE LOOKING\nAT, BUT FOR NOW HE IS BEING TREATED AT THE HOSPITAL AFTER\nTHAT SHOOT-OUT WITH POLICE.

A LOT TO BE GLEANED IN THIS\nINVESTIGATION. ONE THING IS FOR SURE, THIS\nMANHUNT IS OVERHAMI IS IN CUSTODY.\n>> TELL US HOW THEY IDENTIFIED RAHAMI AND WHAT ELSE ARE YOU\nLEARNING WHETHER OR NOT HE HAS CONNECTIONS TO OTHER POSSIBLE\nTERRORISTS WHO MAY STILL BE AT LARGE?\n>> THAT'S THE MOST ARGUMENT QUESTION NOW FOR AUTHORITIES,\nWOLF.

IT'S NOT CLEAR.\nBUT WE KNOW THAT ONE THING WAS, YOU KNOW -- JUST OVER 24 HOURS\nAGO THE AUTHORITIES HAD HONED IN ON WHO WAS RAHAMI?\nTHEY FIGURED IT OUT FROM ANALYZING SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS.\nCERTAINLY AROUND 27th STREET, THE DEVICE THAT DID NOT GO OFF,\nTHERE WAS VERY GOOD IMAGES THAT SHOWED HIM WHEELING THE DUFFEL\nBAG AND ALSO FOUND HE HAD ALSO, WAS ALSO CAUGHT ON CAMERA\nWALKING ON 23rd STREET, THE SCENE OF THE FIRST, THE\nEXPLOSION THERE THAT INJURE THOSE 29 PEOPLE ON SATURDAY\nNIGHT. AND SO WHAT THEY DID FIND FROM\nTHE BOMB THAT DID NOT GO OFF, THEY FOUND PRINTS.\nTHEY FOUND A CELL PHONE THAT TIED BACK TO RAHAMI, AND THAT'S\nHOW THEY WERE SURE JUST ABOUT 24 HOURS AGO THAT THEY KNEW WHO HE\nWAS AND THEY STARTED MONITORING, STARTED DOING SURVEILLANCE OF\nHIS HOME TO TRY TO SEE IF THEY COULD FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING\nON THERE, WHETHER THEY COULD TRY TO ARREST HIM.\nSEVERAL HOURS LATER, WOLF, THEY FIGURED OUT HE WASN'T HOME.\nWHEN THEY FOUND THIGHS PIPE BOMBS IN ELIZABETH AND\nAUTHORITIES DECIDED TO MOVE MORE QUICKLY TO URGENTLY FIND HIM AND\nARREST HIM, WOLF. >> AND EVAN, I WANT TO BE\nPRECISE.

THE BOMB WENT OFF, LUCKILY THE\nRACE WAS DELAYED FOR LOGISTICAL REASONS AND NOBODY WAS INJURED\nWHEN THAT BOMB WENT OFF IN THE GARBAGE CAN AND ONLY ONE OF\nTHREE DEVICES PUT IN THERE DID GO OFF, WOLF.\nIT APPEARS WHATEVER EXPERTISE HE HAD TO BUILD THESE BOMBS IT\nWASN'T GOOD FLUFF ENOUGH TO MAK THEY WORKED EVERY SINGLE TIME.\nTHE ONE ON 23rd STREET INJURED A LOT OF PEOPLE AND A LOT OF LUCK\nTHERE AS WELL, BECAUSE THE BOMB WAS PLACED SOMEHOW GOT\nUNDERNEATH A METAL DUMPSTER, WHICH MEANT THAT THE FORCE OF\nTHE BLAST WAS DENTED SO MUCH BY THE DUMPSTER, WOLF.\n>> ALL RIGHT.

BUT IT'S A PEACEFUL AREA, WHERE\nFAMILIES LIVE. AND THEY WERE SHOCKED THAT THE\nPERSON THAT HAD JUST BEEN TAKEN DOWN WAS WHO THEY WERE LOOKING\nAT ON TELEVISION WHEN THIS ALL HAPPENED.\nWOLF, AS THIS WAS HAPPENING HERE, ABOUT FIVE MINUTES AWAY\nWHERE I WAS JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO WAS WHERE THE FBI EXECUTE\nADD SEARCH WARRANT THIS MORNING. THE FIRST AMERICAN CHICKEN\nRESTAURANT, AND THIS IS WHERE I CONFIRMED WITH THE MAYOR OF\nELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY, THAT RAHAMI AND HIS FAMILY LIVED IN\nTHE UPPER PORTION. A FATHER AND TWO SONS OPERATED\nTHIS RESTAURANT. THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY IN THAT\nAREA KNEW OF THE FAMILY, BUT NOT IN A POSITIVE LIGHT.\nBECAUSE THAT RESTAURANT WAS OPEN FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, FOR 24\nHOURS A DAY. THE MAYOR TOLD ME THERE WERE\nNOISE ORDINANCE VIOLATIONS, CODE VIOLATIONS.\nTHE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS COMPLAINING, BECAUSE THERE WERE\nPEOPLE THERE AT ALL HOURS OF THE NIGHT.\nAND SO THE CITY COUNCIL GOT INVOLVED, AND A LAWSUIT WAS\nFILED BY THE RAHAMI FAMILY SAYING THAT BECAUSE THEY WERE\nMUSLIM, THEY WERE BEING DISCRIMINATED AGAINST.\nNOW, THE MAYOR TOLD ME, AND THIS IS MAYOR CHRIS BOLLWAGE OF\nELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY THAT IN 2012, THAT LAWSUIT WAS ACTUALLY\nSETTLED, AND THE CITY WON THAT LAWSUIT, HE TOLD ME, BUT WE ALSO\nKNOW THAT ABOUT ONE MILE FROM THE FRIED CHICKEN RESTAURANT IS\nWHERE THE DEVICES WERE FOUND INSIDE THE BACKPACK IN THE TRASH\nBIN AT 9:30 LAST NIGHT. AND, WOLF, ONE THING I REALLY\nWANT TO BRING OUT. I LEARN FROM THE MAYOR FOR THE\nFIRST TIME THAT IT WAS TWO HOMELESS PEOPLE THAT FOUND THAT\nBACKPACK IN THE TRASH CAN. THEY TOOK IT UNDER THE TRAIN\nTRACKS. OPENED IT UP.\nTHEY SAW THE PIPES. THEY SAW THE WIRES.\nAND THEY RAN, I WAS TOLD, TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, TO ALERT\nAUTHORITIES WHAT THEY HAD JUST FOUND, AND THAT WAS THE\nBEGINNING OF HAVING THAT -- THAT -- THE FIVE BOMBS IN IT\nACTUALLY LY SUBDUED SO NO ONE W INJURED AND THEY ARE ON THEIR\nWAY NOW TO QUANTICO, VIRGINIA. >> GOOD THING THEY DID WHAT THEY\nDID, THESE TWO INDIVIDUALS.

A A MULTI-STATE MAN HUNT IS\nLAUNCHED FOR RAHAMI AFTER HE IS IDENTIFIED BY A FINGERPRINT ON A\nCELLPHONE NEAR ONE OF THE DEVICES.\nIN ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY, A BACKPACK CONTAINING UP TO FIVE\nPIPE BOMBS FOUND IN A GARBAGE CAN 500 FEET FROM A TRAIN\nTRESTLE. ONE OF THOSE BOMBS DETONATED\nWHEN POLICE SENT A ROBOT TO EXAMINE THE DEVICES AFTER TWO\nMEN HAD ALERTED THEM. TWO FOCUSES OF THE INVESTIGATION\nRIGHT NOW. DID HE HAVE CONTACT WITH FOREIGN\nTERROR GROUPS. NO EVIDENCE AS YET.\nKEEP IN MIND, ENCRYPTION, ENCRYPTED COMMUNICATIONS WILL\nALWAYS BE A CHALLENGE.

MORE ON THAT IN A MOMENT.\nTHIS MORNING HOURS AFTER IDENTIFYING AHMAD KHAN RAHAMI AS\nA PERSON OF INTEREST AND TAKE THE EXTRAORDINARY STEP OF ASKING\nTHE PUBLIC FOR HELP VIA TEXT ERT, POLICE RESPONDED TO A\nCALL THAT A MAN SLEEPING IN THE DOORWAY OF A BAR IN LINDEN, NEW\nJERSEY. WHEN OFFICERS AARRIVED, HE\nOPENED FIRE. RAHAMI ORIGINALLY FROM\nAFGHANISTAN WAS STRUCK BY MULTIPLE POLICE BULLETS AND\nAPPREHENDED JUST AFTER 11:00. REPORTEDLY CONSCIOUS AND AWAKE.\nTHROUGH AN INCREDIBLY FORTUNE SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES, WHAT COULD\nHAVE BEEN A MASS CASUALTY EVENT ULTIMATELY TOOK A MUCH MILDER\nHUMAN TOLL. A CHAIN OF EVENTS BEGAN AFTER\n9:30 ON SATURDAY MORNING WHEN A PIPE BOMB EXPLODED IN SEASIDE\nPARK, NEW JERSEY, ALONG THE ROUTE OF A CHARITY RACE\nBENEFITTING THE MARINE CORPS. THE START OF THE RACE WAS\nDELAYED AND NO ONE WAS INJURED.  WEST 23rd STREET IN MANHATTAN\nWOUNDING 29 PEOPLE IN THE AREA. ALL OF THEM ARE ALREADY OUT OF\nTHE HOSPITAL AND MIRACULOUSLY NOT A SINGLE PERSON WAS KILLED.\nLESS THAN THREE HOURS LATER, A SECOND SIMILAR DEVICE APPARENTLY\nA PRESSURE COOKER BOMB WAS DISCOVER ON 27th STREET.\nTHAT DEVICE WAS TAKEN INTO POLICE CUSTODY AND LATER TURNED\nOVER TO THE FBI. AND LAST NIGHT AT A TRAIN\nSTATION IN NEW JERSEY, TWO HOMELESS MAN FOUND A BACKPACK IN\nA GARBAGE CAN CONTAINING FIVE UNDETONATED BOMBS.\nONE OF THE DEVICES EXPLODED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AS IT\nWAS BEING EXAMINED BY A BOMB ROBOT.\nNO ONE WAS HURT. PRESIDENT OBAMA IN NEW YORK CITY\nFOR THE U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY THANKED LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT\nFOR SAFELY BRINGING THE SUSPECT INTO CUSTODY.\n>> FOR US TO BE ABLE TO APPREHEND A SUSPECT IN JUST A\nLITTLE OVER 24 HOURS AFTER AN EVENT TAKES PLACE LIKE THIS IS\nOUTSTANDING POLICE WORK, OUTSTANDING LAW ENFORCEMENT\nWORK. I IN PARTICULAR WANT TO GIVE A\nHEARTFELT THANKS TO THE NEW JERSEY POLICE OFFICERS WHO WERE\nABLE TO APPREHEND THIS INDIVIDUAL.\nI HAD A CHANCE TO TALK TO THEM BRIEFLY BEFORE I CAME DOWN TO MY\nMEETINGS HERE. THEY WERE IN GOOD SPIRITS AND I\nCOMMUNICATED TO THEM HOW APPRECIATIVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\nWERE AS WELL AS PEOPLE IN THE REGION.\n>> JOINING ME NOW IS FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT YMAN MOHYELDIN.\nHOW WERE THEY ABLE TO APPREHEND THIS INDIVIDUAL?\n>> Reporter: CHRIS, BY ANY MEASURE OF THE WORD, THIS WAS A\nLIGHTNING FAST INVESTIGATION. REALLY WITH TWO PARTS.\nONE, IDENTIFYING THE SUSPECT, IDENTIFYING THE MAN THAT THEY\nWANTED. TWO, ULTIMATELY APPREHENDING HIM\nON THE STREET BEHIND ME. THE FIRST PART OF THAT WAS\nTREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF INTELLIGENCE WORK, INVESTIGATIVE\nWORK, STARTING FROM THE SCENE OF THE EXPLOSIONS WITH THINGS LIKE\nTHE SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE THAT PUT AHMAD KHAN RAHAMI ON THE\nSCENE OF THAT BLOCK WHERE THE TWO EXPLOSIVES WERE IDENTIFIED,\nTHAT PRESSURE COOKER AND THE EXPLOSION THAT DETONATED.\nALSO FINGERPRINTS, A CELL PHONE PING THAT TRACED BACK TO ONE OF\nHIS CELL PHONES LED POLICE TO IDENTIFY HIM AS A PERSON OF\nINTEREST. ULTIMATELY, WHEN THEY WENT TO\nHIS HOUSE IN ELIZABETH NOT TOO FAR AWAY, SPOKE TO HIS FAMILY\nTHAT WAS LEAVING OR TRYING TO CROSS THE BRIDGE.\nTHEY WERE ABLE TO GET MORE INTELLIGENCE, MORE INFORMATION\nTHAT LED THEM TO PUT OUT THAT ALL NOTICE BULLETIN, IF YOU\nWILL, TO POLICE DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE TRI-STATE AREA.\nTHAT WAS THE FIRST PART OF THE INVESTIGATION.\nTHE SECOND PART REALLY ALMOST HAPPENED BY CHANCE ON THE STREET\nHERE RIGHT BEHIND ME. THAT WAS BECAUSE A BAR OWNER\nCOMING TO THAT BAR EARLY THIS MORNING SAW A MAN THAT WAS\nSLEEPING IN HIS DOORWAY. HE THOUGHT HE WAS A HOMELESS\nPERSON. HE CALLED THE POLICE.\nTHE POLICE SHOWED UP AT THE DOORWAY AND THE POLICE OFFICER\nTHAT ARRIVED THERE IMMEDIATELY KNEW THAT THAT WAS A SUSPECT\nTHEY WERE LOOKING FOR. .\nE HE SAID HE RECOGNIZED HIM BECAUSE OF HIS BEARD.\nHE SAID TO SHOW HIM HIS HANDS. WHEN THE MAN THAT WAS LYING ON\nTHE GROUND REACHED FOR HIS JACKET AND PULLED OUT A GUN,\nSHOT THE POLICE OFFICER TWICE, THE POLICE OFFICER THEN RANG OUT\nSHOTS FIRED ON THE RADIO AND THAT TRIGGERED A MASSIVE POLICE\nCRUSH ON THE TO THE AREA WHERE A SHOOTOUT ENSUED LEADING TO THE\nAPPREHENSION OF AHMAD KHAN RAHAMI.\n>> AYMAN MOHYELDIN, THANK YOU FOR THAT UPDATE.\nREALLY APPRECIATE IT.",

IT'S A LINE THAT DIVIDES IT INTO\nINDIAN AND PAKISTANI ADMINISTERED REGIONS.\nTHE ATTACK TOOK PLACE EARLY IN THE MORNING.\nABOUT 5:30 IN THE MORNING. AND FOUR MILITANTS SNUCK INTO\nTHE ARMY BASE AND OPENED FIRE WITH A.K. 47S AND GRENADE.\n17 INDIAN TROOPS WERE KILLED. 7 MORE ARE MANY CRITICAL\nCONDITION. THAT'S WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR BUT\nTHEY HAVE BEEN VERY QUICK TO RESPOND TO THIS ATTACK.\nTHE MINISTER THAT'S NUMBER 2 IN THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT TWEETED ON\nSUNDAY SAYING THAT PAKISTAN IS A TERRORIST STATE THAT SHOULD BE\nISOLATED AND DEALT WITH AS SUCH. SO VERY STRONG WORDS FROM HIM\nAND HE SAID THAT RIGHT AS ONE OF THE TOP INDIAN ARMY OFFICIALS\nCAME OUT AND SAID HE HAD FOUND WHAT HE CALLED QUOTE UNQUOTE\nPAKISTANI MARKINGS ON THE GEAR THAT WAS FOUND ON THE DEAD\nMILITANTS ON SUNDAY AND SO VERY SERIOUS ACCUSATIONS FROM INDIA.\nPAKISTAN ALSO RESPONDED TO THOSE ACCUSATIONS.\nISLAMABAD ON SUNDAY SAID THAT ALL OF THESE ACCUSATIONS BY\nINDIA ARE BASELESS AND IRRESPONSIBLE.\nSO THERE YOU HAVE IT. VERY SERIOUS WORDS FROM BOTH\nSIDES OF THE BORDER AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE REGION\nBUT ALSO FOR THE WORLD BECAUSE AS WE KNOW INDIA AND PAKISTAN\nARE BOTH NUCLEAR NATIONS. PAKISTAN'S PRIME MINISTER IS ON\nHIS WAY TO NEW YORK FOR THE U.S. GENERAL ASSEMBLY MEETINGS AND\nYOU CAN EXPECT THAT THIS WILL BE A DISCUSSION THAT WILL BE HAD\nTHERE AND WILL INVOLVE A NUMBER OF OTHER POWERS AS WELL.\n>> THANK YOU. WE'LL STAY IN TOUCH WITH YOU AS\nWELL. >> WE'LL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE\nLATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY AND HEAR WHAT THE\nGOVERNOR HAS TO SAY AS WE PUSH ON HERE.\n>> MUSCLE INCIDENTS OF BURNED UP GALAXY NOTE 7 SMARTPHONES WENT\nVIRAL ONLINE.

OFFICIALS SAY AT LEAST ONE\nPERSON WAS KILLED. >> THE TRUCE WAS ALREADY AT RISK\nAFTER A COALITION AIR STRIKE KILLED OR WOUNDED DOZENS OF\nSYRIAN TROOPS. WE'RE SEEING THEM HERE IN SYRIA.\nU.S. FORCES SAY THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE HITTING ISIS FIGHTERS\nBUT RUSSIA NOW ACCUSES THE U.S. BECAUSE OF THIS OF DEFENDING\nISIS. AND FAILING TO MEET ITS\nOBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CEASE-FIRE.\nTHE U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE TOLD CNN THE OTHER SIDE, RUSSIA, IS\nUNDERMINING THE TRUCE. SO IT'S BACK AND FORTH.\n>> SO THE SEVEN-DAY SYRIAN CEASE-FIRE EXPIRED ABOUT TEN\nHOURS AGO. AND THERE'S BEEN NO ANNOUNCEMENT\nOF AN EXTENSION SO FAR.

SAYS ITS TRUCKS\nARE STILL STRANDED AT THE BORDER AWAITING PERMISSION FROM THE\nSYRIAN GOVERNMENT TO MOVE AND THE VARIOUS REBEL FACTIONS IN\nTHE TERRITORY LEADING UP TO ALEPPO, AS WELL AND VERY\nIMPORTANTLY, ALSO SAFETY GUARANTEES FOR ITS PEOPLE ON THE\nGROUNDSWELL, GEORGE. >> IN FACT, THAT WAS ONE OF THE\nMAIN AIMS OF THIS CEASE-FIRE TO GET THAT AID INTO THE PEOPLE WHO\nNEED IT MOST.

AND IT WILL GET ANCHORED FURTHER\nINTO NEGATIVE TERRITORY, BUT IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT\nTHEY DO TO HOLD UP THE LONG END.

WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT\nTHING TO FOCUS ON THIS WEEK? >> WELL, WHICH IS MORE\nIMPORTANT? I GUESS DIRECTLY THE FED.\nTHE CHANCES ARE THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS HOW TO SET US\nUP. YOU SAID EARLIER WE'RE SCRAPING\nTHE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL. WE ARE SCRAPING THE BOTTOM OF\nTHE JAM JAR, IF WE CAN GET ENOUGH JAM FOR A CRUMPET BUT NOT\nFOR A MEAL. >> THAT'S A GREAT BRITISH\nANALOGY THERE. >> WE ARE WORKING HARD TO KEEP\nTHE BRITISH THEME GOING THIS MORNING.\nBUT THE KEY THING FOR ME IS THE SENSE OF THE TEN-YEAR U.S.\nTREASURY YIELDS GOING TO BE HEADING UP TOWARDS 2% OR\nCERTAINLY BACK TOWARDS 1.5%. AND I THINK THAT ANYTHING THE\nFED RESERVE DOES, WHICH MAKES IT CLEAR THAT, YEAH, WE'RE STILL\nGOING HIGHER, YEAH, AS OF THE CENTRAL BANK RUNNING OUT OF\nAMMUNITION, WE THINK THE MARKETS SHOULD BE PRICING IN A MOVE IN\nDECEMBER. I THINK THAT KEEPS BOND MARKETS\nON THE BACK FOOT AND THAT IS WHERE THE DANGER IS FOR RISK\nSENTIMENT RIGHT ACROSS THE WORLD.\n>> IS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT THE FED JUST DOES IT, JUST RAISES\nRATES AND SAYS, YES, THERE IS A TREND WITH IT WEAKENING A BIT,\nBUT THEY ARE STILL POINTING TO A HEALTHY RECOVERY WITH INFLATION\nMOVING TO THE TARGET. UP EMPLOYMENT CONTINUES TO\nIMPROVE AND WE'RE GOING TO RAISE RATES.\n>> YEAH, THE LAST TIME THE FED REALLY SURPRISED MARKETS BY\nRAISING RATES WHEN IT WASN'T EXPECTED WAS IN 1994.\nBUT EVER SINCE THEN IT'S KIND OF BEEN RECEIVED WISDOM FOR FOLKS\nLIKE ME THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO DO THAT AGAIN.\nBUT THIS IS THE MOST CAUTIOUS FOMC SINCE THEN FOR SURE,\nPOSSIBLY FOR EVEN LONGER, I DON'T KNOW.\nSO INCREDIBLY CAUTIOUS. I THINK IT IS MORE LIKELY THAT\nTHEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MARKET IS READY FOR THEM TO\nMOVE, IF THE DANGER IN THE NEXT SIX WEEKS ARE FINE, AND TO GO\nAGAIN BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR RATHER THAN RISK THE REACTION OF\nGOING WHEN THEY HAVEN'T GOT THE MARKET IN THE RIGHT PLACE.\nBUT THIS IS ALL GUESSING AT THIS POINT IN TIME IN TERMS OF THAT.\nBUT IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT IS MORE LIKELY.\n>> KIT, WE HAVE SEEN YIELDS TICK UP ALTHOUGH EXPECTATIONS OF A\nRATE HIKE HAVE BEEN PUSHED BACK, WHAT LEVEL OF YIELDS HAVE WE HIT\nFOR EXAMPLE IN THE TEN-YEAR WOULD YOU START TO GET SERIOUSLY\nWORRIED ON THAT THIS WAS THE BURSTING OF THE BOND BUBBLE IN\nTHE RECENT YEARS? >> WELL, I THINK YOU WOULD HAVE\nTO GET WELL ON THE SIDE OF 2%. IN A SENSE, IT'S NOT -- IT'S NOT\nSO MUCH BURSTING A BUBBLE AT THIS POINT IN TIME, IT'S FATIGUE\nTHAT -- WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO OWN GOVERNMENT BONDS ANYWHERE\nWITH NEGATIVE YIELDS INSTEAD OF PUTTING YOUR MONEY IN CASH?\nWHAT CAN CENTRAL BANKS DO IF WE KNOW THEY WOULD LIKE STEEPER\nYIELD CURVES TO KEEP THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM VIABLE?\nTHOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS WE ASK AROUND.\nGENERALLY, WE SEE THAT THE SUPPORT FOR GLOBAL BOND MARKETS\nIS FADING A LITTLE BIT. IF WHAT WE DO, WE HAVE SEEN THE\nLOW IN TREASURY YIELDS AND THE TEN-YEAR YIELD IS, SOMEWHERE AT\nONE POINT, SOMEWHERE BELOW 2%. BIG DEAL.\nIT'S AN OVERSHOOT SPIKE SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE THAT THAT\nWOULD HAVE MUCH MORE COLLATERAL DAMAGE.\nBUT I DON'T SEE A BIG BEAR MARKET IN BONDS.\nI JUST THINK WE HAVE SEEN THE LOW IN YIELDS FOR QUITE A LONG\nTIME. >> WHAT ABOUT THE DOLLAR?\nWHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE DOLLAR, ARE YOU BUYING IT INTO THE FED\nMEETING WHETHER OR NOT THEY RAISE RATES SEPTEMBER, DECEMBER\nOR MAYBE EARLY NEXT YEAR? >> YEAH, I THINK THE DOLLAR,\nWHICH HAS BEEN LARGELY MOVING SIDEWALKS AGAINST THE EURO AND\nYEN FOR MONTHS NOW, WHICH HAS LOST GROUND OVER THE SUMMER, ALL\nTHOSE LAZY, THOSE COMFORTABLE EASY CARRY TRADES THAT WE SAW AS\nPEOPLE WERE HUNTING YIELD OVER THE SUMMER.\nI THINK WE CAN STILL UNWIND MORE OF THAT IF MARKETS ARE\nENCOURAGED TO PRICE IN A RATE HIKE DOWN THE ROAD WITH MORE\nCONVICTION. I THINK THOSE TRENDS CAN BE\nTAKEN OFF AS PEOPLE TAKE BETS OFF.\nA MUCH SHARPER DOLLAR MOVE SEEMS UNLIKELY AT THIS POINT, WE'RE\nNOT -- WE'RE FINE-TUNING A FED STORY AND WE'RE TRYING TO COPE\nWITH THE END OF THE CYCLE IN MONETARY POLICY OVER THE BANK OF\nJAPAN. >> KIT, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US\nTHIS MORNING.

THAT'S WHERE THE THING'S GOING\nTO BE DECIDED 50 DAYS FROM NOW WE'LL KNOW THE ANSWER, GUYS.\n>> JOHN, THANK YOU FOR THAT. AND FOR MORE ON THIS LET'S BRING\nIN FROM WASHINGTON FORMER CRUZ CAMPAIGN SPOKESMAN RICK TYLER\nAND POLITICO ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENT AND CNBC\nCONTRIBUTOR BEN WHITE. GENTLEMEN, GOOD MORNING TO YOU\nBOTH. >> GOOD MORNING.\n>> BEN, ONCE AGAIN WE'RE SORT OF LEFT WITH THE PUZZLE OF WHY THE\nMARKET IS, I WOULDN'T SAY RALLYING, BUT AT LEAST GREEN IN\nTHE FACE OF AN EVENT LIKE WHAT WE SAW OVER THE WEEKEND.\nWHY IS THAT? >> WELL, I WOULD THINK THAT, YOU\nKNOW, THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A CONCERN THAT YOU HAVE AFTER AN\nEVENT LIKE THIS PEOPLE ARE NERVOUS.\nBUT THERE HASN'T BEEN TREMENDOUS DAMAGE FROM IT.\nWE SEEM TO HAVE A TARGET IN MIND, A PERSON WHO IT LOOKS LIKE\nIS BEHIND THESE ATTACKS. AND MY GUESS IS MARKETS ARE\nANTICIPATING THE FED THIS WEEK. THE FED STAYING ON HOLD, NOT\nRAISING INTEREST RATES, THAT'S OBVIOUSLY GOOD FOR MARKETS.\nTHIS IS A DISTURBING EVENT BUT NOT ONE THAT WOULD SHAKE\nMARKETS. THAT'S WHAT WE'VE SEEN SO FAR.\n>> THEN OF COURSE WE HAD THE SECRETARY SPEAK A FEW MOMENTS\nAGO, RICK, IN WHICH SHE RELIES ON AN ARGUMENT BASED ON HER\nEXPERIENCE. I KNOW HOW TO DO THIS.\nI WAS IN THE SITUATION ROOM. OF COURSE THE NATURAL RESPONSE\nIS, WELL, WHAT DO WE HAVE TO SHOW FOR IT AFTER THIS WEEKEND,\nRIGHT? >> YEAH, I THINK THAT'S THE\nCENTRAL ARGUMENT. I WATCHED HER PRESS CONFERENCE\nAND SHE COMPETENTLY DELIVERED A CONFIDENT AND CONFIDENCE MESSAGE\nTHAT IN THESE SITUATIONS SHE'S BEEN THERE BEFORE, SHE'S BEEN IN\nTHE SITUATION ROOM, SHE'S CONTRIBUTED TO DECISION MAKING\nTHAT HAS LED TO THE DEFEAT OF TERRORISM.\nBUT AT THE SAME TIME ISIS REALLY WAS AN OUTGROWTH OF THE ONE\nWOULD ARGUE THE OBAMA/CLINTON FOREIGN POLICY.\nIT DID NOT EXIST BEFORE HILLARY CLINTON WAS SECRETARY OF STATE.\nTHAT'S NOT TO SAY SHE'S ENTIRELY RESPONSIBLE FOR IT, BUT THE\nMIDDLE EAST WHERE TERRORISM HAS EXISTED SHE CERTAINLY WAS AT THE\nHEAD -- SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE DURING THAT TIME.\nI DO THINK THAT SHE DID FOCUS ON RIGHTLY AND HAS NOT BEEN ENOUGH\nIS TO COUNTER THESE PERSUASIVE ONLINE SOCIAL MEDIA NETWORKING\nTHAT ISIS USES VERY EFFECTIVELY. EFFECTIVELY MEDIA COMPANIES\nRECRUITING AND PERSUADING PEOPLE WHO LIKE PERHAPS RAHAMI WILL\nFIND OUT WHETHER THEY WERE PERSUADED BY THOSE KINDS OF\nVIDEOS AND BECAME RADICALIZED HERE IN THE UNITED STATES.\n>> YEAH, THAT INTELLIGENCE SURGE THAT SHE TALKED ABOUT.\nBEN, WE DO HAVE THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE UNITED NATIONS\nHERE IN NEW YORK. IT'S A REMINDER THAT THE U.S.\nRELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER WORLD LEADERS MATTER.\nWHO SHOULD SECRETARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP BE FOCUSED ON WHEN\nIT COMES TO THE FIGHT ON TERROR, WHICH IS NOW FRONT AND CENTER?\n>> RIGHT, WELL, CERTAINLY OUR ALLIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST YOU'LL\nSEE BOTH OF THESE CANDIDATES MEETING WITH THE EGYPTIAN\nLEADERS. AND IT'S, YOU KNOW, ALSO ACROSS\nEUROPE THERE'S REALLY NO ONE AMONG THESE WORLD LEADERS AT THE\nU.N. WHO WOULD NOT BE BENEFICIAL FOR THESE PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATES TO MEET WITH TO TALK ABOUT OUR EFFORTS TO FIGHT\nTERRORISM BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND ABROAD.\nBUT IT'S REALLY CRITICAL FOR THEM TO ESTABLISH RELATIONS WITH\nOTHER MIDDLE EASTERN LEADERS WHO ARE OUR PARTNERS IN THE WAR ON\nTERROR AND TRYING TO STOP THESE TYPES OF EVENTS IN THE UNITED\nSTATES. BUT I THINK WHAT THIS SHOWS US\nTHESE BOMBINGS IN NEW YORK IS THAT THIS IS AN UNSETTLED\nPRESIDENTIAL RACE THAT IS SUBJECT TO OUTSIDE SHOCKS FROM\nHERE ON OUT. YOU KNOW, DONALD TRUMP'S\nCAMPAIGN IS BASED IN PART ON A MESSAGE OF CRACKING DOWN ON\nIMMIGRATION, IF IT TURNS OUT THIS WAS INDEED AN AFGHANI WHO\nIMMIGRATED TO THE UNITED STATES FAIRLY OR UNFAIRLY, THAT PLAYS\nINTO THE TRUMP NARRATIVE THAT WE HAVE TO BE TOUGHER AND CRACK\nDOWN HARDER. I THINK SECRETARY CLINTON DID A\nFINE JOB IN HER PRESS CONFERENCE, BUT SHE WAS SLIGHTLY\nON THE DEFENSIVE THERE WITH QUESTIONS SAYING DOESN'T THIS\nPLAY INTO DONALD TRUMP'S NARRATIVE AND MESSAGE?\nAND TO A DEGREE I THINK IT DOES, AND THESE THINGS WILL CONTINUE\nTO PLAY OUT AND DEBATES WILL BE CRITICAL.\nBUT WE HAVE AN UNSTABLE AND VERY CLOSE PRESIDENTIAL RACE SUBJECT\nTO OUTSIDE INFLUENCE. >> YEAH.\nIT'S TRUE. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT\nBIRTHER CONTROVERSY OR THAT ECONOMIC SPEECH FROM LITERALLY\nJUST DAYS AGO. GUYS, WE HAVE TO CUT IT SHORT\nTODAY. BUSY DAY AS YOU UNDERSTAND.\nTHANKS SO MUCH BEN WHITE AND",

AND THAT, AT LEAST SO FAR, NO\nINDICATION THERE IS A TERRORISM CELL OPERATING IN THE CITY.\nIN REGARDS TO THE MASS MOBILE ALERT SENT OUT THIS MORNING,\nOFFICIALS SAYING THIS TOOL AIDED IN THE HELP OF THE APPREHENSION\nOF THAT SUSPECT, RAHAMI, AND BACK HERE ON 23rd STREET, WHERE\nA BOMB EXPLODED SATURDAY NIGHT, THE INVESTIGATION IS STILL\nONGOING. YOU CAN SEE BEHIND ME, THE FBI\nIS STILL ON THE SCENE AND THE NEW YORK FIRE DEPARTMENT IS HERE\nON THE STREET, WHICH IS STILL CLOSED DOWN AS WELL.\nGUYS, BACK OVER TO YOU. >> THANK YOU, MORGAN BRENNAN, IN\nMANHATTAN, WITH THE LATEST ON THAT STORY.\nLET'S GET MORE ON WHAT IS FUELING THE WEAKNESS ON THE\nMARKET NOW. GOOD TO SEE YOU.\nMARK, I'LL START WITH YOU. YOU AS WELL AS MANY OTHER MARKET\nWATCHERS OUT THERE THINK NOTHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN ON WEDNESDAY.\nBUT AT THE SAME TIME, EVEN THOUGH THERE IS AN EXPECTATION\nNOTHING IS HAPPENING, WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS THE TEN YEAR YIELD\nIS CREEPING HIGHER. WE HAVE -- AND THE DOLLAR INDEX\nIS UP BY 1.4%. SO ISN'T THE FED'S WORK BEING\nDONE IN A WAY. >> IN A WAY, IT IS.\nI THINK OUR BOND YIELDS ARE MOVING UP, SPREADS REMAIN\nRELATIVELY EVEN WITH OTHER BONDS AROUND THE WORLD THAT HAVE BEEN\nBACKED UP HERE, PARTICULARLY THE TEN-YEAR GERMAN BUND AND\nJAPANESE GOVERNMENT BOND. ALL ON THE SUSPICION THEIR\nCENTRAL BANKS MAY BE LIMITED IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY CAN DO OR ARE\nOUT OF BULLETS. BUT THE STRENGTH OF THE DOLLAR\nIS DOING THE FED'S HEAVY LIFTING, IS CURBING INFLATION\nAND ACTING AS A GOVERNOR IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY.\nIT IS A FEEDBACK LOOP THE FED IS CAUGHT IN, EVERY TIME THEY LEAN\nHAWKISH, IT STRENGTHENS THE DOLLAR AND IT IS PRODUCTIVE TO\nONE OF THE DUAL MANDATES THEY CONTINUE TO WHIFF ON, PRICE\nSTABILITY MEASURED BY 2% INFLATION RATE.\n>> HOW DOES THAT INFLUENCE THE MARKETS AND YOUR VIEW OF THE\nMARKETS GOING INTO YEAR END? >> THE STRONGER DOLLAR MEANT\nWEAKNESS FOR THE EQUITY MARKETS. THERE IS A NUMBER OF CROSS\nCURRENTS. YOU CONTINUE TO HAVE LOW RATES,\nSTIMULATIVE MONETARY POLICY, LOW INFLATION, ALL OF THESE ARE\nREASONABLY POSITIVE FOR THE EQUITY MARKETS.\nTHE OTHER THING IS, WE HAVE SEEN THE PRETTY MEANINGFUL INVENTORY\nCORRECTION AND WE HAVE RELATIVELY LOW EARNINGS\nEXPECTATIONS FOR THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.\nAGAIN, FAIRLY POSITIVE FOR THE NEAR TERM MARKET ACTIVITY.\nTHE BIGGEST UNCERTAINTY IN THE NEGATIVE IS 2017.\nIF WE DON'T SEE RESURGENCE OF CAPITAL SPENDING, IF WE DON'T\nSEE PICKUP IN NEW BUSINESS FORMATION, I THINK MARKETS COULD\nRUN OUT OF STEAM, BUT FOR THE NEAR TERM, STILL LOOKS PRETTY\nGOOD. >> SOUNDS LIKE YOU THINK THERE\nCOULD BE A GLIDE PATH SETTING UP FOR STOCKS IN THE NEXT FEW\nMONTHS OR SO? SAFE TO BE IN THE MARKET SO TO\nSPEAK? >> THE MARKET HAS BEEN VERY MUCH\nIN THE RISK ON, RISK OFF TYPE OF VOLATILE ENVIRONMENT, SO TO SAY\nIT IS SAFE, I WOULDN'T DESCRIBE IT THIS WAY.\nBUT AT THIS POINT, I THINK THERE ARE MORE TAILWINDS THAN HEAD\nWINDS, BUT AS WE APPROACH 17, THE DANGER SIGNS START TO FLASH\nMUCH MORE LOUDLY. >> GIVE EN YOUR VIEW OF WHERE\nRATES WILL BE, WHERE THEY ARE TODAY, DOES THAT -- IN THE VIEW\nTHERE IS THIS FREE AREA HERE FOR THE MARKET TO GO HIGHER, IS IT\nBETTER -- IF YOU HAD HAD TO INVEST THE DOLLAR TODAY OR\nWHATEVER AMOUNT IT IS TODAY IN DIVIDEND YIELDING STOCKS, SAFETY\nPLAYS THAT HAD BEEN IN FAVOR FOR SO LONG, THE FAVORITES OF LOW\nVOLATILITY FUND ETFs AND ACTIVE FUNDS OUT THERE OR IN GROWTH,\nLIKE TECHNOLOGY? >> A LITTLE OF BOTH.\nI THINK THAT WHILE WE HAVE SEEN A BACKUP IN THE INTEREST RATE\nSENSITIVE SECTORS HERE, TEN YEAR BOND YIELDS BOUNCED SOMEWHAT, I\nSUSPECT THERE IS A CERTAIN SELF-LIMITING CHARACTERISTIC\nABOUT THE MARKET THAT THE ECONOMY CAN'T TOLERATE\nSIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER RATES. SO WHILE I DO EXPECT THE FED TO\nBE ON HOLD THIS MEETING, THEY'LL USE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SIGNAL\nTHAT A RATE HIKE IN DECEMBER IS A VERY HIGH PROBABILITY AND AS\nTHE MARKET BAKES THAT IN, THEY THINK THE FED WILL FEEL MORE\nCOMFORTABLE IN GOING FORWARD WITH THAT DECISION AND THEREFORE\nI STILL THINK WE WANT TO BE IN GROWTH SECTORS THAT WILL DO WELL\nREGARDLESS OF THE UNDERPINNINGS ECONOMICALLY AND IN OR ON THE\nRATES SIDE AND BE SENSITIVE TO THE INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY OF\nTHE CLASSIC DEFENSES BUT THE FACT THEY HAVE BEEN BID UP TO\nTHE POINT WHERE THE VALUATIONS TOLERATE LITTLE ROOM FOR ERROR.\n>> GUYS, LEAVE IT THERE.",

LET'S -- THEY ARE GOING TO DO\nONE OF TWO THINGS. THEY ARE EITHER GOING FOR A\nMASSIVE STIMULUS PROGRAM AND THE DOLLAR IS GOING TO RIP, OR THEY\nARE NOT. AND IF THEY DON'T DO SOMETHING,\nTHEN YOU HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS ALL OVER THE PLACE BECAUSE THEY\nNEED SOMETHING. THEY'VE GOT NOTHING.\nTHEY'VE GOT A HUGE PROBLEM OVER THERE.\n>> I THINK THE BANK OF JAPAN IS IMPORTANT.\nAND I WOULD ARGUE THEY ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE FED BECAUSE I\nDON'T THINK THE FED WILL DO ANYTHING.\nBUT HOW ARE THEY GOING TO SUDDENLY EITHER GO ON A SPENDING\nSPREE OR A NOTHING SPREE.

YOU COULD SEE A SELLOFF IN THE\nFINANCIALS BASED ON FACT WE'VE SEEN EXPECTATION TRADE AHEAD OF\nTHIS. THERE IS STILL THE SLIGHT CHANCE\nTHEY MOVE ON IT. THE FINANCIALS ARE SOMETHING TO\nKEEP AN EYE ON.

SO CALL ME AT 1-800-743-CNBC OR\nTWEET ME @JIMCRAMER. HOW DO YOU REMOVE THE FED AND\nOIL FROM THE STORY OF THIS MARKET?\nHOW DO WE GET THE FOCUS BACK ON INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES?\nNOT THE OVERALL OBSESSION WITH WHAT THE FED WILL DO ON\nWEDNESDAY OR WHAT DIRECTION OIL MIGHT BE HEADING ON A MINUTE TO\nMINUTE BASIS.

IN A DECEPTIVELY QUIET MARKET\nWITH THE DOW ULTIMATELY JUST SETTING OFF FOUR POINTS, S&P\nCLOSING ESSENTIALLY FLAT, WE KNOW ALL ABOUT THE LINKAGE OF.\nBUT THE FED, I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, I JUST HEAD BRINGING THIS\nTO YOU. I HATE BRINGING IT UP BECAUSE\nEVERYONE ELSE TALKED ABOUT IT. SOMETIMES THERE'S NO AVOIDING\nIT. WE KNOW WHAT THE BULLS WANT TO\nHEAR. THAT THE FED IS NOW ON HOLD,\nPERHAPS UNTIL WE START TO SEE STRONGER RETAIL SALES\nMANUFACTURING IMPORTS. THE DECLINE IN SO MANY SECTORS\nLAST WEEK WAS ABOUT HOW THE FED MIGHT SAY OR DO THE WRONG THING.\nMORE SAY THAN DO. EITHER GIVE US SOME STERN\nLANGUAGE ABOUT THE NEED FOR ANOTHER RATE HIKE BEFORE THE END\nOF THE YEAR, OR MAYBE THEY EVEN DO SHOCK US WITH AN OUTRIGHT\nRATE INCREASE, SOMETHING MOST PEOPLE SAY IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY,\nBUT THAT'S WHAT WORRIES ME THE MOST, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE SAW\nDECLINES THAT WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE OTHERWISE IN THE LAST\nCOUPLE WEEKS. OVER THE COURSE OF MY CAREER,\nI'VE OFTEN FOUND THAT IF EVERYONE IS WORRIED ABOUT A BIG\nBAD EVENT, YOU BETTER BE PREPARED NOT FOR THE OUTCOME OF\nTHE BIG, BAD EVENT, BUT FOR WHAT TO DO AFTERWARDS.\nAND THAT USUALLY MEANS KNOWING WHAT'S GOING TO GO UP ONCE THE\nEVENT IS OVER. WHAT MAKES STOCKS GO UP AFTER A\nBIG, BAD EVENT LIKE THE FED MEETING?\nSIMPLE. OTHER THAN SMALL MOVEMENTS IN\nOIL THAT PROPEL PEOPLE IN AND OUT OF THE NARKT, THE BUYERS ARE\nALMOST TOTALLY SIDELINED. THEY'RE PARALYZED.\nTHEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO GOING INTO THE EVENT.\nWHILE SELLERS JUST KEEP TAKING MONEY OUT, AND WE KNOW THAT'S\nBEEN THE WAY IT'S BEEN FOR YEARS.\nTHIS IS MY BIG, BAD EVENT THEORY.\nONCE AN EVENT TRANSPIRES, EVEN IF THE OUTCOME IS SUBOPTIMAL,\nMONEY FROM THE SIDELINES STARTS TO COME BACK IN.\nAS INVESTORS WHO WERE WAITING FOR THE EVENT TO HAPPEN FEEL\nSAFE TO START BUYING AGAIN REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME OF THE\nEVENT. NOW, THE IMPACT OF THESE BUYERS\nCAN BE TEMPERED BY A VERY HAWKISH STATEMENT THAT UNDOES\nWHATEVER NON-ACTION THE FED TAKES OR BY CONTINUED WORRIES\nINVOLVING THE ELECTION. SO MAYBE THE BUYING I EXPECT\nWILL BE A LITTLE MORE MUTED THAN USUAL.\nBUT WHAT SHOULD BE THE MARKET BE FOCUSED ON AFTER WE GET THROUGH\nTHE FED MEET SOMETHING I THINK BUYERS SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR WHO\nHAS GROWTH AND STICK WITH THAT THESIS NO MATTER WHAT.\nWHAT'S A PRIME EXAMPLE OF A GROWTH COMPANY?\nLET'S TALK AMAZON. I'M GOING TO USE THAT AS AN\nANALOG FOR HOW TO TAKE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRADE THAT MIGHT BE\nBUSTED AFTER THE BIG, BAD EVENT. LAST WEEK WE SPENT DAYS\nPROMOTING HOW NEGATIVE AND DISMISSIVE THE PANELISTS AT THE\nALPHA CONFERENCE WERE ABOUT THE STOCK MARKET.\nTHEY WERE SO GLOOMY THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD RENAME THE CONFERENCE\nDANGEROUS ALPHA.

AND THIRD, I THINK THE IMPORTANT\nTHING THAT WE MIGHT LEARN FROM THIS IS HOW DO WE PREVENT FUTURE\nATTACKS. CLEARLY THERE ARE THESE KINDS OF\nATTACKS, PEOPLE WILL TRY TO GENERATE THEM.\nONE THING, FOR EXAMPLE, WE KNOW THIS FELLOW TRAVELLED TO\nPAKISTAN AND AFGHANISTAN. MAYBE WE HAVE TO START\nSCRUTINIZING PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING TRIPS TO THAT REGION OF\nTHE WORLD IN TERMS OF WHAT THE LIKELIHOOD IS OF THEIR TURNING\nTO SOMETHING LIKE THIS. >> HE DIDN'T ONLY TRAVEL THERE.\nHE SPENT ALMOST A YEAR IN AN AREA IN PAKISTAN, QUETTA, WHICH\nIS HEAVILY TALIBAN ORIENTED AND THEN CAME BACK TO THE UNITED\nSTATES.

THE QUESTION IS, WHEN HE CAME\nBACK, DID HE DO ANYTHING THAT WOULD HAVE TRIGGERED FURTHER\nANALYSIS OR INVESTIGATION. >> WHY HAVEN'T WE HEARD ANY\nCLAIM OF RESPONSIBILITY? >> PROBABLY BECAUSE HE DID THIS\nON HIS OWN. ISIS IS VERY QUICK TO CLAIM\nRESPONSIBILITY WHEN THEY CAN. THEY WANT TO DO THAT.\nTHEY WANT TO SAY LOOK HOW BIG AND STRONG AND TOUGH WE ARE.\nMY GUESS IS, AND AT THIS POINT WE'RE STILL GATHERING THE\nFACTS -- HE WAS ACTING OUT OF SOME KIND OF GRIEVANCE.\nWE DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT WAS BECAUSE OF HIS FIGHT WITH THE\nCITY OF ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY, WITH HIS FAMILY OR BECAUSE HE\nCOULDN'T BRING HIS WIFE BACK. I MEAN, WE DON'T REALLY KNOW\nYET. THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO\nKIND OF TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND GENERATE AND DEAL WITH THE FACTS\nAS THEY COME FORWARD. >> ANY EVIDENCE THAT WHAT WAS A\nCELL, THAT HE HAD ACCOMPLICES WHO HELPED HIM TO BUILD THE\nBOMBS? >> THERE WAS TALK OF THAT FIRST.\nI HAVEN'T HEARD ANY OF THIS LATER TODAY.\nTHE FACT THAT IT WAS HIS FINGERPRINTS THAT WERE FOUND ON\nTHE OTHER BOMBS INDICATE THAT -- IT INDICATES -- THAT'S A KEY\nWORD, INDICATES. DOESN'T PROVE BUT INDICATES THAT\nHE WAS ACTING ALONE. WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING THAT\nLEADS US TO BELIEVE.

WE LEARNED THERE WAS ONGOING\nTENSION, AND ALSO THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES OVER AN ORDINANCE\nAND HOURS OF OPERATION.

SO FOR EXAMPLE, YOU MAY NOT TALK\nTO SOMEONE VERY OFTEN, BUT IF YOU TALK TO THEM FOR TWO OR\nTHREE HOURS AT A TIME, THAT MAY BE CONSIDERED A STRONGER\nCONNECTION IN YOUR SOCIAL NETWORK THAN SOMEONE YOU SPEAK\nTO FREQUENTLY BUT FOR SHORTER PERIODS OF TIME, AND WHETHER OR\nNOT YOU DO IT VIA E-MAIL OR TEXTS.\n>> SO INTERESTING. LET ME ASK YOU ALSO, WHAT DID WE\nHEAR FROM THE HEAD OF HOMELAND SECURITY ABOUT THIS CASE?\n>> THE HEAD OF HOMELAND SECURITY WAS SPEAKING IN WASHINGTON THIS\nMORNING, AND HE REALLY SPOKE TO THE CURRENT THREAT PICTURE,\nSAYING THERE MAY BE SOMETHING BEHIND THE SCENES THEY HAVE TO\nCONFRONT. >> NO CREDIBLE THREAT IS\nEVOLVING. THIS IS NOT A COMMENT ABOUT THIS\nWEEKEND'S EVENTS, BUT WE HAVE TO BE VIGILANT, CONCERNING THE LONE\nWOLF ACTORS. >> WE ALSO HEARD AT THE LAST\nNEWS CONFERENCE, THEY'RE STILL LOOKING TO TALK TO TWO MEN SEEN\nIN THE SURVEILLANCE VIDEO.

THEY ARE PHOTOGRAPHING\nEVERYTHING. THEY ALSO COLLECTED EVIDENCE\nFROM THE SCENE FOUR BLOCKS FROM US WHERE ANOTHER PRESSURE COOKER\nBOMB WAS RECOVERED. THE EXPLOSION HERE WAS ALSO A\nPRESSURE COOKER BOOK PACKED WITH BEBES AND OTHER SHRAPNEL.\nIT WAS ALONG A TACK OF A WOUNDED MILITARY CHARITY RUN.\nTHEY WERE TIED TO THESE TWO LOCATIONS HERE ON 23rd AND 27th\nSTREET. THOSE BOMBS APPARENTLY ALSO TIED\nTO THE SUSPECT. RAHANI INVOLVED IN THE SHOOT OUT\nTHIS MORNING AFTER HIS PICTURE WAS RELEASED TO MILLIONS OF\nPEOPLE IN THE AREA. HE WAS CONSIDERED ARMED AND\nEXTREMELY DANGEROUS. AS YOU HEARD, HE WAS WORKING AT\nHIS FAMILY'S FRIED CHECKEN RESTAURANT, AND IT IS JUST A\nHALF MILE FROM WHERE THE OTHER BOMBS WERE FOUND.\nTHEY SPOTTED HIM IN A DOOR WAY. HE IS WOUNDED AND IN CUSTODY.\nTHE NEW COMMISSIONER THAT SAID THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF LAW\nENFORCEMENT PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THE ION EVERY DAY.\n. A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE CALLING IT\nA CELL, WHAT ARE WE LEARNING MORE ABOUT ALL OF THAT?\n>> IT WAS A VEHICLE THAT WAS DETAINED LAST NIGHT ON THE BELT\nPARKWAY. AND THERE WAS CONCERN THE FIVE\nMEN INVOLVED WERE CONNECTED SOMEHOW.\nTHOSE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CLEARED. HOWEVER, A MEMBER OF THE JOINT\nTERRORISM TASK FORCE SAID BASED ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES, IT IS, IN\nHIS OPINION, A HIGHLY LIKELY THAT RAHANI HAD HELP OR SUPPORT.\nAND HELP MAKING THOSE DEVICES. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH.\nINFORMATION WE JUST GOT, AND WE WILL PICK OUT WHAT IS IMPORTANT\nAND WHAT STANDS OUT.",

WHAT'S HAPPENING AS SORT OF A\nSECOND CHANNEL, IF YOU WILL, OR PATHWAY IN THE INVESTIGATION IS\nTHAT THEY ARE ABLE TO GO THROUGH NOW HIS SOCIAL MEDIA, HIS\nELECTRONICS, HIS COMPUTER AND THEY CAN BUILD OUT A PROFILE OF\nHIP AND HIS NETWORK OF CONTACTS. THEN THEY CAN MA MARRY THAT UP\nTHE QUESTIONS THEY CAN ASK HIM ABOUT WHAT HE WAS DOING LEADING\nUP TO THE FIRST EXPLOSION AT THE RACE IN NEW JERSEY AND THEN ALSO\nTHE EXPLOSION IN NEW YORK TO TRY AND ASSESS BASED ON WHAT THEY\nHAVE INDEPENDENT OF HIM FROM HIS ELECTRONICS AND WHAT HE TELLS\nTHEM WHETHER HE IS BEING TRUTHFUL ABOUT WHETHER IT WAS A\nPLOT THAT WAS AFFECTED BY ONLY HIMSELF AND THERE WERE NO OTHERS\nOR WHETHER HE IS, IN FACT, LYING TO THE FBI AND THAT, OF COURSE,\nWOULD BE ANTICIPATE ADDITIONAL CRIMINAL CHARGE.\n>> TUCKER, YOU HAVE A QUESTION? >> IN CONTRAST TO OTHERS ON\nMILITANTS ATTACKING THE WEST, IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE HE WAS\nATTEMPTING SUICIDE. >> Reporter: IT'S HARD TO GET\nINSIDE THE MIND OF AN INDIVIDUAL LIKE THIS.\nEVERYONE'S PATH TO RADICALIZATION IS DIFFERENT.\nAS WE HEARD IN NEW YORK EARLIER TODAY, THIS IS SOMETHING THEY'RE\nTRYING TO UNDERSTAND. WHETHER HE WAS ON A SLOW BOIL\nFOR A WHILE OR WHETHER IT WAS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED WHAT\nTHEY CALL NOW A VERY SHORT FLASH TO BANG.\nTHE FLASH TO BANG IS BUYING INTO THE IDEOLOGY AND THEN DECIDING\nTO ACT. WHAT REALLY HAS MY ATTENTION IS\nTHE TRIPS TO AFGHANISTAN AT THIS POINT.\nWE'RE TOLD THERE WERE A HANDFUL, ABOUT THREE.\nBUT THEY WERE OVER ABOUT A SIX-YEAR PERIOD.\nSO IT DID NOT RAISE RED FLAGS WITH THE AUTHORITIES BECAUSE\nTHEY WERE NOT SO FREQUENT THAT IT SEEMED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO\nHAVE SOME ALTERNATE FORM OF FINANCING.\nYOU MAKE A GOOD POINT. HE WAS NOT, IT SEEMED, ON A\nSUICIDE MISSION AT THE END.  INDIVIDUALS WHO LOSE THEIR\nCOURAGE WHEN IT COMES TO THE FINAL MOMENTS.\n>> YEAH.

DOES IT HAVE TO BE ONE TRIP\nWITHIN A YEAR OR THREE TRIPS OVER THREE YEARS?\nARE PEOPLE FOLLOWING THIS PATTERN?\n>> Reporter: WELL, ONE OF THE SORT OF CALCULUSES THEY MAKE IS\nWHETHER THESE TRIPS SEEM TO EXCEED WHAT THIS PERSON'S\nPERSONAL FINANCES CAN REALLY JUSTIFY AND AFFORD.\nI WAS TOLD BY A LAW ENFORCEMENT CONTACT THAT BASED ON THE\nPATTERN AND THE FREQUENCY, IT DID NOT SEEM TO EXCEED THIS.\nI JUST WANT TO BRING YOU BACK IF I CAN TO ONE POINT THAT RICK\nMADE, WHICH I THINK IS WHERE THE STORY MAY GO NOW IN THE NEXT 24\nHOURS. WE HAVE HAD TWO SOURCES NOW\nCONFIRM TO FOX NEWS THAT THERE WAS SOME PRIOR CONTACT BETWEEN\nRAHAMI AND THE FBI. IT ROSE OUT OF THIS DOMESTIC\nDISPUTE. WE'RE TOLD THAT WAS SOME YEARS\nAGO. BUT IN THE COURSE OF THAT\nDOMESTIC DISPUTE, THE FAMILY MEMBER MADE AN ALLEGATION HE WAS\nGETTING RADICALIZED AND THIS WAS PURSUED BY THE FBI.\nI WAS TOLD THAT THEY DID INTERVIEW HIM IN PERSON AND THEY\nFELT THAT THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH TO PROCEED AT THAT POINT.\nTO BE FAIR TO THE FBI, WE HAVE SEEN THIS IN OTHER CASES LIKE\nBOSTON. BUT THE WAY OUR SYSTEM WORKS IS\nTHAT YOU JUST -- IF THERE'S NOT ENOUGH THERE TO PROCEED OR TO GO\nFORWARD, THEN THEY CANNOT LEAVE THESE PEOPLE ON THE RADAR\nINDEFINITELY, IF YOU WILL. >> THAT'S DISTURBING.\n>> WHAT WE SAW THIS WEEKEND, NOT ONLY IN NEW YORK BUT THEN, OF\nCOURSE, IN NEW JERSEY AND ALSO MINNESOTA WOULD LEAD TO THE\nQUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT WHAT YOU ARE GETTING IS DIRECTIONS\nFROM THE TERRORIST OVERSEAS TO GO AFTER SOFT TARGETS.\nWHAT DO WE KNOW? >> Reporter: WELL, BOTH ISIS AND\nAL QAEDA HAVE BEEN DOING WHAT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED BY THE FBI\nDIRECTOR AS THE CROWD SOURCING OF TERRORISM, WHICH IS THEY\nPULSE OUT THIS MESSAGE TO ATTACK WHERE YOU ARE AND TO HIT SOFT\nTARGETS HOPING THAT ONE FRACTION OF ONE PERCENT WILL ACT ON THAT\nINFORMATION. WE HAVE SEEN NO EVIDENCE SO FAR\nTHAT THE SUSPECT IN NEW YORK NOR THE SUSPECT IN MINNEAPOLIS HAD\nDIRECT CONTACT WITH A TERRORIST GROUP.\nTHEY WERE THEN DIRECTED TO ACT IN A CERTAIN WAY AND IN A\nCERTAIN TIME FRAME. SO THAT'S NOT THERE YET.\nBUT WE'RE STILL IN EARLY DAYS AT LEAST IN NEW YORK.\n>> THERE IS SOME INDICATION WITH RESPECT TO THE MINNESOTA ATTACK\nTHAT THAT WAS AT LEAST -- THEY TOOK CREDIT FOR IT IN ONE OF THE\nPUBLICATIONS THAT ISIS DID. >> Reporter: ISIS HAS WHAT I\nWOULD CALL AN OFFICIAL PROPAGANDA MOUTHPIECE THAT THEY\nPUT OUT CLAIMS OF RESPONSIBLE. THEY DID THAT OVER THE WEEKEND.\nEVERYTHING I HAVE HEARD FROM MY CONTACTS IS THAT DOES APPEAR TO\nHAVE BEEN AN ISIS-INSPIRED EVENT AS OPPOSED TO AN --\n>> DIRECTED. >> Reporter: FOR THE PEOPLE\nSTABBED IN THE MALL, I'M NOT SURE IT MAKES MUCH OF A\nDIFFERENCE. >> YOU ARE RIGHT.\nEXCELLENT REPORTING.",

BUT OF COURSE THEY ARE\nEVERYWHERE IN THE CITY AS YOU MENTIONED A LITTLE EARLIER THE\nNYPD ACTUALLY HOLDING OVER ITS OVERNIGHT SHIFT OFFICERS, AND\nNOW THEY ARE DOING PATROLS THIS MORNING, AS WELL.\nAND IT IS AGAIN MAKING A DIFFERENCE.\nEVERYBODY NOTICING THESE PEOPLE STATIONED.\nAND THEY'RE GOING TO BE DOING BAG CHECKS.\nTHEY'RE GOING TO HAVE K-9 UNITS ON THE TRACKS WHEN IT COMES TO\nTHE TRANSIT SYSTEM. AND THEY'RE ASKING EVERYONE TO\nBE VIGILANT.

SO YES OF COURSE, REMAINING CALM\nBUT VIGILANT, AS WELL. >> OFFICERS WILL BE ASKING\nPEOPLE TO CHECK THEIR BAGS RANDOMLY THROUGHOUT THE DAY,\nTHROUGHOUT THE WEEK? >> WELL, YEAH, THEY'RE GOING TO\nHAVE OFFICERS STATIONED AT DIFFERENT SUBWAY STATIONS HERE\nAT PENN STATION, AS WELL. BUT IT IS GOING TO BE RANDOM.\nTHAT'S ALL PART OF THE NYPD'S PROCESS.\nRIGHT? TO JUST GO TO CERTAIN AREAS THAT\nAREN'T NECESSARILY JUST TIMES SQUARE OR THE U.N.

WELCOME, SIR.\n>> THANK YOU, CAROL. >> THANKS FOR BEING HERE.\nTHE MAYOR SAYS THAT THE PUBLIC PLAYS A CRUCIAL ROLE HERE.\nSO IN YOUR MIND, WHAT CAN PEOPLE DO TO HELP?\n>> WELL, I MEAN, LAW ENFORCEMENT NEEDS THE ASSISTANCE OF THE\nPUBLIC. PART OF THE REASON WHY THOSE\nBOMBS WERE LOCATED LAST NIGHT IN ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY WAS\nBECAUSE PEOPLE SAW SOMETHING, THEY SAID SOMETHING, THEN CALLED\nLAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS IMMEDIATELY.\nIN THE CASE OF THE BOSTON BOMBERS, A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO,\nTHEY WERE APPREHENDED BECAUSE THE PUBLIC GOT INVOLVED.\nWE NEED THE SAME THING HERE IN NEW YORK CITY.\nI'M HERE RIGHT NOW AT THE SITE ON 23rd STREET.\nTHE GOVERNOR IS ABOUT TO ARRIVE HERE, AND WE'RE HEADING TO PENN\nSTATION ON THE SUBWAY TOGETHER. WHERE HE'S GOING TO HOLD A PRESS\nCONFERENCE AND GIVE AN UPDATE ON WHAT'S CURRENTLY HAPPENING.\n>> AND YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO RIDE THE SUBWAY.\nIS THAT FOR A REASON? >> YOU KNOW, JUST TO SHOW THE\nPUBLIC THAT THIS SUBWAY STATION IS REOPENED.\nTHAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE USING THE SUBWAY.\nTHE SUBWAY STATION 23rd STREET AND 7th AVENUE THE ONE TRAIN\nTHAT WAS CLOSED FOR A LITTLE WHILE AFTER THE BOMBING THAT\nTOOK PLACE HERE, SO WE'RE HERE, AND THE GOVERNOR'S GOING TO\nPROVIDE MORE INFORMATION. THE STATE OF NEW YORK IS\nSUPPLEMENTING NYPD FORCES WITH 1,000 ADDITIONAL OFFICERS.\nNATIONAL GUARD MEMBERS. AS THE CITY IS ON HIGH ALERT.\n>> WHEN YOU HEAR THAT WILL ARE SUSPICIONS THAT THERE IS A\nTERROR CELL OPERATING WITHIN NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY, THAT'S GOT TO\nBE UNSETTLING. >> OH, I MEAN IT'S FRIGHTENING.\nYOU KNOW, THIS NEIGHBORHOOD THAT I REPRESENT, CHELSEA, IS A\nRESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD, THE HOME OF THE LARGEST LGBT\nCOMMUNITY IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK, AND WEST 23rd STREET AND\nWEST 27th STREET I LOVE THOSE TWO BLOCKS BUT THEY'RE NOT\nNONDECRYPT RUN OF THE MILE BLOCKS.\nTHEY'RE NOT BLOCKS WITH MILITARY FACILITIES OR POLICE FACILITIES.\nIT'S NOT TIMES SQUARE OR GRAND CENTRAL, OR THE WORLD TRADE\nCENTER. THESE ARE PLACES THAT YOU WOULD\nNEVER THINK WOULD BE A TARGET. SO, IT'S EVEN SCARIER THAT ON A\nWARM, BUSY, BUSTLING SATURDAY NIGHT THAT THIS TYPE OF THREAT\nWOULD HAPPEN HERE IN THIS RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD.\n>> IT IS PUZZLING THAT THE SUSPECT PLACED THESE PRESSURE\nCOOKER BOMBS IN GARBAGE BINS, AND NOT LEFT THEM SOMEWHERE OUT\nON THE STREET OR IN A RESTAURANT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.\n>> WELL, I MEAN, I'M NOT OF COURSE A COUNTERTERRORISM EXPERT\nAND I KNOW YOU GUYS HAVE HAD PLENTY OF PEOPLE ON TALKING\nABOUT THIS. BUT I WOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW,\nWHAT I'M HEARING, IT'S SIMILAR TO WHAT WAS USED IN BOSTON,\nTHOSE HOMEMADE PRESSURE COOKERS. STUFF THAT'S BEEN IN AL QAEDA\nMANUALS IN THE PAST. BUT WE HAVE TO WAIT TO SEE IF WE\nHAVE MORE INFORMATION HERE ON SITE RIGHT NOW.\nTHE FBI IS STILL GATHERING EVIDENCE.\nI CAN SEE THEM HERE. THEY'RE TRYING TO LOOK AT\nANYTHING THAT'S STILL ON THE STREET, OR IN THE SIDEWALK, OR\nON THE SURROUNDING BUILDINGS. SO I'M SURE WE'RE GOING TO GET\nMORE INFORMATION IN THE HOURS AND DAYS TO COME.\nTHE NO IMPORTANT THING THOUGH IS IF YOU SEE SOMETHING, YOU KNOW,\nSAY SOMETHING, CALL 911. CONTACT THE NYPD.\nOR YOUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN THE METROPOLITAN\nAREA AS THEY TRY TO HUNT DOWN PERSONS OF INTEREST.\n>> ALL RIGHT. COUNCILMAN COREY JOHNSON.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH ME THIS MORNING.\nI'LL LET YOU GET BACK TO IT. AND STAY WITH US AS WE CONTINUE\nTO COVER THE BREAKING NEWS.

IT'S ALWAYS HEIGHTENED AT THIS\nTIME OF YEAR BECAUSE OF THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY.\nNOW THERE'S ANOTHER FEELING TO IT.\nIT'S NOT JUST THE HEADS OF STATE, THE PRIME MINISTERS, THE\nPRESIDENTS THAT ARE SORT OF THE TARGET OF THIS.\nNOW, YOU'VE GOT AN INDIVIDUAL LIKE THIS SUSPECT, WHO'S AIMING\nAT REGULAR NEW YORKERS. YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF NEW YORKERS\nNOW WHO ARE BEING VERY VIGILANT, AS WELL.\nBUT DEFINITELY A HEIGHTENED STATE OF ALERT.\nAND WE CAN TELL YOU THAT EVERYONE'S SORT OF KEEPING THEIR\nEYES AND EARS OPEN TO EVERYTHING SUSPICIOUS.\nAS A MATTER OF FACT, WE'VE SEEN A COUPLE OF PEOPLE APPROACH\nPOLICE OFFICERS, IDENTIFYING SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T LOOK LIKE\nTHEY BELONG. IDENTIFYING A PACKAGE, WHERE IT\nSHOULDN'T BE. SO WE'VE WITNESSED THAT\nOURSELVES. PEOPLE ARE VERY AWARE, ANDERSON.\n>> A LOT OF PEOPLE IN NEW YORK RECEIVED A MESSAGE THIS MORNING,\nCONNECTION WITH THE SEARCH ABOUT THE SUSPECT.\n>> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. AS A MATTER OF FACT, IT CAME\nTHROUGH ON OUR CELL PHONES, LIKE THIS ON AN EMERGENCY RESPONSE\nSYSTEM, THAT USUALLY IDENTIFIES PEOPLE WHEN THERE'S AN AMBER\nALERT OR SOME SORT OF A STORM COMING.\nTHIS ONE ON MY DEVICE CAME IN AT 7:54.\nWANTS, GIVES THE NAME OF THE SUSPECT, 28-YEAR-OLD MALE, SEE\nMEDIA FOR PICTURE, CALL 911 IF SCENE.\nTHIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES THIS PARTICULAR SYSTEM HAS EVER\nBEEN USED TO ALERT THE PUBLIC THAT THEY'VE GOT A GUY THEY\nREALLY WANT TO GET. SO THAT WAS THE FIRST THAT CAME\nIN. BUT WE ALSO SAW AUTHORITIES\nUSING TWITTER AND FACEBOOK AND PUSHING OUT THIS IMAGE OF THE\nSUSPECT TO TELEVISION STATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, BECAUSE THEY\nWERE VERY CONCERNED THAT NOW THAT HE WAS AWARE THAT HE MIGHT\nHAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED, THAT HE WAS GOING TO GO ON THE RUN.\nTHEY REALLY WANTED TO STOP IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.\nAND YOU KNOW, PLUS, YOU'VE ALSO GOT THIS VERY SOPHISTICATED\nVIDEO SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM THROUGHOUT NEW YORK CITY.\nABOUT 3,000 CAMERAS. AND THAT'S HOW POLICE WERE ABLE\nTO IDENTIFY. THEY HAD DETECTIVES POURING OVER\nALL THAT VIDEO TO TRY TO CONNECT SOMEBODY ON 23rd STREET WITH\nSOMEBODY ON 22nd STREET, AS WELL.\nTHERE ARE A LOT OF CAMERAS HERE. WE'VE SEEN SOME.\nONE OF PRODUCERS JUST GOT A PIECE OF VIDEO SHOWING THE\nSUSPECT ROLLING TWO BAGS UP THIS STREET, ABOUT THE TIME OF THE\nBLAST. BUT THE FBI DIRECTOR SAYS HE\nDOESN'T -- THE CHIEF HERE IN NEW YORK SAYS HE DOESN'T BELIEVE\nTHAT THERE IS A CELL OPERATIONS HERE.\nTHEY STILL WANT TO KNOW WHY HE DID THAT, AND PERHAPS, IF\nSOMEBODY AT LEAST HELPED. ANDERSON?\n>> DEB FEYERICK, THANKS FOR THE REPORTING.\nOUR BREAKING NEWS CONTINUES IN THE NEXT HOUR OF \"360.\"\nTHE DETAILS OF A HANDWRITTEN NOTE AUTHORITIES SAY HE LEFT\nWITH ONE OF THE EXPLOSIVES.",
