DONALD TRUMP IS SEEKING SECURITY\nCLEARANCES FOR HIS CHILDREN, HIS ADULT CHILDREN, AND HIS\nSON-IN-LAW, JARED CUSHNER. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MUCH MORE ON\nTHIS DEVELOPMENT COMING UP. BRIAN TODD HAS MORE ON JARED\nCUSHNER RIGHT NOW, A MAN WHO MAY BECOME ONE OF THE MOST\nINFLUENTIAL FIGURES IN THE WHITE HOUSE.\n>> Reporter: SIGNIFICANT THAT HE IS REQUESTING A SECURITY\nCLEARANCE FOR HIM. HE'S SAID TO AVOID THE SPOTLIGHT\nWHENEVER POSSIBLE, BUT TONIGHT, CUSHNER IS BELIEVED TO BE A KEY\nPLAYER IN THE SELECTION OF CABINET MEMBERS AND WILL LIKELY\nHAVE HIS FATHER-IN-LAW'S EAR IN THE OVAL OFFICE.\n>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, PRESIDENT OBAMA.\n>> Reporter: AS DONALD TRUMP SAT IN THE OVAL OFFICE WITH\nPRESIDENT OBAMA, ONE MAN IN THE ROOM SEEMED LIKE AN ON SECURE\nJUNIOR STAFFER. SNAPPING PICTURES IN THE BACK\nWITH HIS SMARTPHONE. HE WAS LATER SEEN WALKING ON THE\nWHITE HOUSE GROUNDS WITH MR. OBAMA'S CHIEF OF STAFF.\nTONIGHT, THE SAME MAN APPEARS ON TRACK TO BECOME ONE OF THE MOST\nINFLUENTIAL PEOPLE IN THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE, MAYBE WITHOUT A\nTITLE. THE INCOMING CHIEF OF STAFF\nSPOKE ABOUT HIM ON NBC'S \"TODAY\" SHOW.\n>> I THINK JARED CUSHNER, OBVIOUSLY HIS SON-IN-LAW, IS\nGOING TO BE VERY INVOLVED IN DECISION MAKING.\n>> Reporter: TRUMP'S 35-YEAR-OLD SON-IN-LAW, MARRIED FOR SEVEN\nYEARS TO IVANKA, IS CONSIDERED SHY AND AVOIDS THE SPOTLIGHT.\n>> HE'S VERY GOOD AT POLITICS. >> Reporter: BUT IN THE TRUMP\nWHITE HOUSE, HIS POWER WILL LIKELY BE CONSIDERABLE.\n>> I THINK IT WILL BE SIMILAR TO THE ROLE HE PLAYED IN THE\nCAMPAIGN, WHICH IS INFORMAL, AND BEHIND THE SCENES, AND YET,\nMASSIVELY INFLUENTIAL. I THINK HE'S SEEN AS KIND OF A\nCONDUIT TO DONALD TRUMP AND A MAJOR DECISION MAKING PLAYER.\n>> Reporter: CUSHNER IS A BILLIONAIRE REAL ESTATE\nDEVELOPER AND PUBLISHER. >> HE HAS TIES TO WALL STREET\nINVESTORS, THE JEWISH COMMUNITY IN NEW YORK CITY, AND ALSO THE\nMEDIA COMMUNITY. >> Reporter: HE BOUGHT THE NEW\nYORK OBSERVER NEWSPAPER WHEN HE WAS 25, AND ONCE TRIED TO BUY\nTHE LOS ANGELES DODGERS. HE DIDN'T HAVE A FORMAL TITLE IN\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, BUT SOURCES SAY HE WAS AMONG THE CANDIDATE'S\nMOST TRUSTED ADVISERS. ONE SOURCE TELLING CNN THAT\nCUSHNER WAS INTIMATELY INVOLVED IN THE DECISION TO FIRE COREY\nLEWANDOWSKI LAST SUMMER. SAID TO BE INTENSELY LOYAL, HE\nONCE PUSHED BACK AGAINST HIS OWN NEWSPAPER, WHICH ACCUSED TRUMP\nOF BEING ANTI-SEMITIC. CUSHNER, AN ORTHODOX JEW, WROTE\nTHAT TRUMP EMBRACED MY FAMILY AND OUR JEWDAISM.\n>> MY SON-IN-LAW IS YOUISH, MY DAUGHTER IS JEWISH, AND I LOVE\nTHEM. >> Reporter: EXPERTS SAY THAT HE\nCOULD AVOID BREAKING A LAW IF HE DOESN'T TAKE A SALARY OR A\nFORMAL TITLE. BUT HE COULD HAVE ANOTHER\nCONFLICT. >> THEY HAVE TO BE CAREFUL THAT\nHE DOESN'T BECOME A CONDUIT OF INFORMATION, BECAUSE HE'S GOING\nTO HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS DOING, AND\nIF HE TALKS TO HIS WIFE ABOUT WHAT THE BUSINESS IS DOING,\nTHERE IS A CONFLATING OF THE BUSINESS AND OFFICIAL INTEREST.\nTHAT'S SOMETHING I THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO KEEP SEPARATE.\n>> Reporter: ONCE AGAIN TONIGHT, JIM ACOSTA REPORTING THAT DONALD\nTRUMP HAS REQUESTED SECURITY CLEARANCES FOR HIS CHILDREN AND\nJARED CUSHNER.

AFTER THE 2010 AND 2014 MIDTERM\nELECTIONS. >> I'M NOT RECOMMENDING EVERY\nFUTURE PRESIDENT TAKE SHALACKING LIKE I DID LAST NIGHT.\n>> Reporter: BUT NO LAUGHTER TODAY AS TO CORNER STONES OF HIS\nLEGACY FROM OBAMACARE TO CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY ARE AT RISK IN A\nTRUMP ADMINISTRATION. ASKED ABOUT THOSE QUESTIONING\nTRUMP'S RIGHT TO RULE, THE PRESIDENT SAID TRUMP WON.\n>> HOPEFULLY IT'S A REMINDER THAT ELECTIONS MATTER.\nAND VOTING COUNTS. AND SO I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY\nTIMES WE HAVE TO RELEARN THIS LESSON, BECAUSE WE ENDED UP\nHAVING 43% OF THE COUNTRY NOT VOTING WHO WERE ELIGIBLE TO\nVOTE. BUT IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE.\n>> Reporter: AFTER INTENSE CRITICISMS, PRESIDENT OBAMA\nSOUNDED ALMOST IMPRESSED BY TRUMP'S VICTORY.\n>> WHAT'S CLEAR IS THAT HE WAS ABLE TO TAP INTO, YES, THE\nANXIETIES, BUT ALSO THE ENTHUSIASM OF HIS VOTERS IN A\nWAY THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE. >> Reporter: THE PRESIDENT\nCLEARLY TRYING TO PUT A GOOD FACE ON EMRATIC PARTY,\nWOLF, HE SAID IT'S A HEALTHY THING THE GOING THROUGH\nA TIME OF REFLECTION. THAT MAY BE AN UNDERSTATEMENT.\nAS THE PRESIDENT BEGINS TO LEAVE FOR HIS FINAL FOREIGN TRIP\nTONIGHT, IT'S CLEAR HE WANTED TO GET AHEAD OF THAT TRIP SO HE CAN\nSEND THE MESSAGE TO WORLD LEADERS THAT DONALD TRUMP WILL\nBE THE NEXT PRESIDENT, AND HE MAY NOT BE AS UNQUALIFIED AS\nPRESIDENT OBAMA ONCE DECLARED. WOLF?\n>> JEFF, THANK YOU. JEFF ZELENY IN NEW YORK CITY FOR\nUS. PRESIDENT OBAMA DECLINED TO\nCOMMENT ON DONALD TRUMP'S MOST CONTROVERSIAL APPOINTMENT,\nNAMING STEVE BANNON AS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE STRATEGIST.\nJIM ACOSTA IS WORK THING PART OF THE STORY FOR US.\nA LOT OF OUTRAGE FOR US OVER BANNON'S APPOINTMENT.\nWHAT'S THE LATEST? >> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT, WOLF.\nFIRST OF ALL, WE SHOULD POINT OUT WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM A\nTRANSITION SOURCE THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS REQUESTED TOP SECRET\nSECURITY CLEARANCES FOR HIS ADULT CHILDREN AND SON-IN-LAW,\nJARED CUSHNER, WHO IS AN IMPORTANT ADVISER.\nAS FOR STEVE BANNON, TRUMP ADVISERS ARE RUSHING TO HIS\nDEFENSE, BUT THE BANNON BACKLASH IS GROWING.\nIN SELECTING STEVE BANNON AS HIS CHIEF STRATEGIST, DONALD TRUMP\nHAS INVITED INTO THE OVAL OFFICE ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE\nSO-CALLED ALT-RIGHT. HE SAYS HE WILL ACT AS EQUAL\nPARTNERS WITH REINCE PRIEBUS, WHO WILL SERVE AS WHITE HOUSE\nCHIEF OF STAFF. WHILE TRUMP ADVISERS ARE\nPRAISING THE BANNON PICK -- >> HE'S BEEN THE GENERAL OF THIS\nCAMPAIGN. >> Reporter: BANNON IS ALREADY\nCOMING UNDER FIRE WHEN HE WAS CHAIRMAN OF BREITBART NEWS.\nFOR YEARS, HE'S CALLED FOR A TAKEOVER OF THE REPUBLICAN\nPARTY. >> WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS BITCH\nSLAP THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND GET THOSE GUYS -- IF WE HAVE TO,\nWE'LL TAKE IT OVER. >> Reporter: A SPOKESMAN FOR\nHARRY REID SAID IN A STATEMENT, PRESIDENT-ELECT'S CHOICE OF\nSTEVE BANNON AS A TOP AIDE SIGNALS THAT WHITE SUPREMIST\nALSO BE REPRESENTED AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS IN TRUMP'S WHITE\nHOUSE. >> THE GUY I KNOW IS A GUY THAT\nISN'T ANY OF THOSE THINGS. HE IS A GUY WHO IS PRETTY --\nHE'S VERY, VERY SMART. VERY TEMPERATE.\n>> Reporter: THE BANNON PICK COULD ENFLAME ANTI-TRUMP\nPROTESTERS AND RALLY A NATION THAT'S WITNESSING A RISE OF\nHATEFUL RHETORIC, AND ATTACKS ON MINORITIES, WHICH TRUMP SAID\nMUST COME TO AN END. >> I AM SO SADDENED TO HEAR\nTHAT, AND I SAY STOP IT! IF IT -- IF IT HELPS, I WILL SAY\nTHIS, AND I'LL SAY IT RIGHT TO THE CAMERA, STOP IT!\n>> Reporter: ON THE ISSUES, TRUMP IS SIGNALING A POTENTIAL\nSOFTENING ON TOPICS, SUGGESTING HE WON'T WORK TO OUTLAW SAME-SEX\nMARRIAGE. >> THESE CASES HAVE GONE TO THE\nSUPREME COURT AND HAVE BEEN SETTLED.\nAND I AM FINE WITH THAT. >> Reporter: BUT ON ANOTHER\nFRONT, ROE VERSUS WADE, TRUMP SAID HE WOULD APPOINT\nANTI-ABORTION JUDGES AND IF IT'S OVERTURNED, IT WOULD BE UP TO\nTHE STATES TO DECIDE. AS FOR TRUMP'S SIGNATURE\nCAMPAIGN ISSUE -- >> DON'T WORRY, WE'RE GOING TO\nBUILD THE WALL. >> Reporter: THE PRESIDENT-ELECT\nIS OPEN TO SOMETHING OTHER THAN A WALL ALONG THE BORDER.\n>> THERE COULD BE SOME FENCING. >> Reporter: NOW, THE TRUMP TEAM\nIS FAR FROM UNANIMOUS ON THE SELECTION OF STEVE BANNON AS\nCHIEF STRATEGIST AND THE WHITE HOUSE, I TALKED TO ONE OFFICIAL\nWHO SAID BANNON IS BEING GIVEN TOO MUCH POWER, AND DONALD TRUMP\nIS MAKING PROGRESS. HIS TRANSITION TEAM IS MAKING\nPROGRESS ON SELECTION OF JOHN BOLTON AND RUDY GIULIANI, WHO\nARE SAID TO BE TWO TOP CONTENDERS FOR SECRETARY OF\nSTATE. WOLF?\n>> JIM, THANKS. GOOD REPORTING FOR US.\nJIM ACOSTA REPORTING FROM OUTSIDE TRUMP TOWER IN NEW YORK\nCITY. LET'S GET MORE ON ALL OF THIS.\nREPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN ADAM KINSINGER OF ILLINOIS IS JOINING\nUS. THANKS FOR JOINING US.\n>> YOU BET, WOLF. >> CNN JUST LEARNED THAT TRUMP\nIS SEEKING TOP SECRET SECURITY CLEARANCES FOR HIS ADULT\nCHILDREN, INCLUDING HIS SON-IN-LAW JARED CUSHNER.\nWHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO THAT? DO YOU THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE\nTHIS CLEARANCE? >> IT'S HARD TO TELL.\nIT DEPENDS ON WHAT LEVEL OF TOP SECRET.\nTHERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE, BY THE WAY, IN THE COUNTRY THAT HAVE\nTOP SECRET SECURITY CLEARANCE, BASICALLY ANYBODY THAT DOES WHAT\nI DO IN THE MILITARY GETS IT. SO IT'S A LEVEL THAT YOU HAVE TO\nGO THROUGH SOME INTENSE BACKGROUND, BUT THAT'S DIFFERENT\nTHAN WHAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED BASICALLY PRESIDENTIAL LEVEL\nSECURITY, AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT THAT'S CALLED OR THAT\nCLASSIFICATION. BUT BASICALLY YOU'RE EXPOSED TO\nANYTHING THE PRESIDENT HAS, VERSUS JUST TOP SECRET.\nSO I'VE GOT TO GET MORE DETAILS. AND FRANKLY, I THINK IT'S AT THE\nREQUEST OF THE PRESIDENT TO MAKE A DECISION WHO HIS ADVISERS ARE,\nSO I'M NOT GOING TO QUESTION IT. >> BUT DURING THE CAMPAIGN, HE\nSAID HIS THREE ADULT CHILDREN WOULD RUN THE BUSINESS, AND\nTHERE WOULD BE A WALL BETWEEN HIM AND THEM AS FAR AS THE\nBUSINESS IS CONCERNED. THEY'LL TAKE OVER THE BUSINESS.\nHE'LL WORK 100% EXCLUSIVELY AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nIF THEY'RE GOING TO RUN THE BUSINESS, WHY WOULD THEY NEED\nTOP SECRET SECURITY CLEARANCES? >> I THINK A LOT OF THAT STUFF\nIS GOING TO SHAKE ITSELF OUT. WE'RE ON DAY SIX OF THE\nTRANSITION RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE ANOTHER TWO MONTHS TO\nGO. OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S A LOT OF\nHYPER ATTENTION TO WHAT'S GOING ON, AS THERE SHOULD BE.\nYOU HAVE A NEW PRESIDENT-ELECT, NO POLITICAL EXPERIENCE, HAS A\nBUSINESS AND HAS KIDS VERY INVOLVED.\nI THINK AS WE GO ON, I THINK YOU'LL SEE THE PRESIDENT-ELECT\nBUILD WHATEVER THAT WALL IS, THAT'S GOING TO SEPARATE HIS\nBUSINESS FROM HIS DUTIES AS PRESIDENCY.\nAND I THINK AGAIN, GIVING YOUR CHILDREN TOP SECRET SECURITY\nCLEARANCE, WHILE THEY'RE ALSO DOING THE BUSINESS SIDE OF\nTHINGS, THIS IS GOING TO CHANGE ITSELF OUT PROPERLY.\nWE'RE ON DAY FIVE OR SIX RIGHT NOW.\nTHERE'S A LOT OF REAL ESTATE IN FRONT OF US BEFORE IT BECOMES\nPRESIDENT TRUMP. >> PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID CERTAIN\nASPECTS OF DONALD TRUMP'S TEMPERAMENT WILL NOT SERVE HIM\nWELL AND COULD IMPACT MARKETS, NATIONAL SECURITY.\nDO YOU THINK DONALD TRUMP UNDERSTANDS THE GRAVITY OF BEING\nPRESIDENT AND THAT IT'S DIFFERENT FROM CAMPAIGNING?\n>> I THINK HE DOES. THE DAY -- HERE'S WHAT STRUCK ME\nIN A BIG WAY. SO NOT ONLY JUST THE DAY AFTER\nTHE ELECTION AND THE NIGHT WHEN HE CAME OUT AND GAVE HIS VICTORY\nSPEECH, WHICH WAS VERY HUMBLE. AND HILLARY CLINTON'S WAS VERY\nGOOD TOO, BY THE WAY. AND WHEN HE MET WITH PRESIDENT\nOBAMA IN THE OVAL OFFICE, IT SEEMS LIKE SOMEBODY THAT'S\nREALLY KIND OF TAKING THE WEIGHT OF THE PRESIDENCY ON.\nIT'S ONE THING TO CAMPAIGN, AS A CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE, OF\nCOURSE IT'S NOT EVEN A FRACTION OF WHAT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT\nIS. WHEN YOU RUN AND YOU WIN, ALL OF\nA SUDDEN YOU WAKE UP THE NEXT DAY AND YOU REALIZE I'VE GOT TO\nBE A CONGRESSMAN NOW. AND I THINK YOU'RE SEEING THAT\nWITH DONALD TRUMP, IS THIS REALIZATION THAT, CAMPAIGNING IS\nFUN, IT'S ONE THING, NOW HE'S GOING TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE\nUNITED STATES, AND HE'S GOT A BIG COUNTRY TO LEAD.\nAGAIN, LET'S SEE HOW THIS SHAKES ITSELF OUT.\nAS PRESIDENT OBAMA ELOQUENTLY SAID TODAY, AND I THINK HE\nUNDERSTANDS FIRST HAND, THERE IS A LEARNING CURVE ASSOCIATED, AND\nGIVE PRESIDENT TRUMP A CHANCE. >> THE PRESIDENT INDICATED THAT\nTHE PRESIDENCY IN HIS WORDS, HAS A WAY OF WAKING YOU UP.\nDO YOU THINK DONALD TRUMP IS BECOMING MORE MODERATE ALREADY\nSINCE THE ELECTION, MORE REALISTIC NOW THAT HE'S BEEN\nELECTED PRESIDENT? >> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT MODERATE\nOR WHATEVER. I THINK HE'S COMING TO\nUNDERSTAND THAT, OKAY, AGAIN, NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE EXPECTED\nDONALD TRUMP TO WIN. I THINK THERE WERE PROBABLY A\nLOT IN THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION THAT WERE SURPRISED BY HIS\nVICTORY. ALL OF A SUDDEN THE NEXT DAY YOU\nWEAK UP AND SAY NOT ONLY DO I HAVE NATIONAL DEFENSE ISSUES TO\nDEAL WITH, PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE AT STAKE, BUT I ALSO HAVE TO START\nTHINKING ABOUT BUILDING A LEGACY AND WHAT IS ACTUALLY ACHIEVABLE\nIN A POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT. YES, THE REPUBLICANS HAVE ALL\nLEVERS OF GOVERNMENT FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT FEW YEARS, BUT WE\nDON'T HAVE 60 VOTES IN THE U.S. SENATE.\nSO HOW DO YOU BUILD THIS? HE'S ALWAYS CLAIMED THAT HE'S A\nDEAL MAKER, HE CAN ACCOMPLISH THINGS.\nIT LOOKS LIKE HE'S THINKING THAT WAY NOW.\nSO GIVE HIM AN OPPORTUNITY. >> PRESIDENT OBAMA SAYS HE\nTHINKS DONALD TRUMP IS PRAGMATIC, NOT IDEALOGICAL.\nYOU DIDN'T SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP DURING THE CAMPAIGN.\nDO YOU THINK HE IS PRAGMATIC OPPOSED TO BEING IDEALOGICAL?\n>> I HOPE HE IS PRAGMATICALLY IDEALOGICAL.\nI HOPE HE COMES WITH AN IDEOLOGY, BUT A PRAGMATISM TO\nSAY THERE'S A LESSON TO LEARN AND THE REPUBLICANS IN 2004 THAT\nTURNED AROUND AND LOST IN '06 AND PRESIDENT OBAMA THAT WON IN\n'08, TO TURN AROUND AND LOSE IT IN 2010, WHICH IS YOU HAVE TO\nACCOMPLISH YOUR PRIORITIES. OBAMACARE WILL BE A BIG ISSUE\nAND EVERYTHING ELSE. BUT THERE'S ALSO SPACE TO REACH\nOUT TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE AND SAY, LET'S TRY TO FIND\nAREAS WE CAN WORK TOGETHER. THAT'S THE PRAGMATISM PART OF\nTHE IDEOLOGY. AN INFRASTRUCTURE BILL WITH TAX\nREFORM OR WHATEVER THAT LOOKS LIKE.\nAN OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE DEMOCRATS TO A BUY-IN.\nJUST BECAUSE THEY LOST POWER OUT HERE DOESN'T MEAN THEY HAVE TO\nLOSE ALL INFLUENCE. SO IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR\nEVERYBODY TO COME TOGETHER, I THINK.\n>> DONALD TRUMP APPOINTED -- NAMED HIS CAMPAIGN CEO STEVE\nBANNON AS A TOP ADVISER IN THE WHITE HOUSE.\nSOME WHITE SUPREMISTS TODAY CALLING THE MOVE EXCELLENT.\nSOME CONSERVATIVES VERY CRITICAL, SAYING HE REPRESENTS\nAN EXTREME RIGHT, ALMOST RACIST, FASCIST POSITION.\nTHOSE ARE HARSH WORDS INDEED. WHERE DO YOU SEE IT?\n>> WELL, JUST LIKE PRESIDENT OBAMA, WHO BASICALLY DECIDED HE\nWASN'T GOING TO COMMENT ON IT, I THINK RIGHT NOW LET'S LET THIS\nALL SHAKE OUT. THERE'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN SOME\nTHINGS THAT HAVE BEEN ON THE WEBSITE THAT I CONDEMN WHOLE\nHEARTEDLY. BUT I DON'T KNOW STEVE BANNON, I\nDON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HIM EXCEPT HE'S ASSOCIATED TH\nSO LET'S PLAY IT BY EAR. IF WE SEE THINGS, OF COURSE,\nEVERY MEMBER OF COURSE AND EVERY PARTY LEADER WILL BE UP IN ARMS\nAND SAY THING IS INAPPROPRIATE. BUT RIGHT NOW, PRESIDENT-ELECT\nTRUMP IS PUTTING TOGETHER HIS INNER CIRCLE AND I'M GIVING HIM\nSPACE, JUST LIKE I DID IN 2012 FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA.\n>> CONGRESSMAN, WE'RE GETTING NEW INFORMATION.\nPRESIDENT PUTIN TODAY CALLED PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP.\nTHEY HAD A SERIOUS PHONE CONVERSATION.\nWE'RE GETTING SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THAT CONVERSATION, AND THE\nFUTURE OF U.S.-RUSSIA RELATIONS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1479170731804.1479166500086.41ed010c-ba06-4166-8ecd-3d5147b8934b.segment0.thumb.jpg", "channel": "202"}, {"start": 0, "length": 557487.0, "end": 557487, "date": 1479170123942, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1479173646020.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1479170110024-f0df7b17-a25f-4de0-8773-577b45d45d3d-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=0.00,557.49", "text": "OR WOMEN OR OTHERS THAT WERE\nCONCERNED ABOUT THE TENOR OF THE CAMPAIGN.\n>> Reporter: AND PRESIDENT OBAMA ENDED, HE ALSO TALKED,\nMENTIONED, STRUCK A HOPEFUL NOTE, I SHOULD SAY, IN TALKING\nABOUT HOW THE PRESIDENCY HAS A TENDENCY TO WAKE PEOPLE UP AND\nSORT OF INTRODUCE THEM TO REALITY THAT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT\nFROM HOW GOVERNING IS. IT'S THE SAME HOPEFUL OPTIMISTIC\nNOTE HE STRUCK A FEW MINUTES AGO WHEN HE WAS ON A CALL WITH\nDEMOCRATIC SUPPORTERS TELLING THEM, LOOK, YOU CAN MOPE FOR A\nLITTLE WHILE BUT YOU GOT TO THEN GET IT TOGETHER AND LOOK AHEAD\nTO THE FUTURE. HE SAID I'M STILL FIRED UP AND\nREADY TO GO. >> ALL RIGHT.\nTHANK YOU. LET'S GO TO JIM ACOSTA\n\"OUTFRONT\" FROM TRUMP TOWEREN TO.\nJIM, A BIG DEVELOPMENT HERE. PRESIDENT-ELECT'S CHILDREN,\nTHEIR ROLE IN THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE AND NOW SECURITY\nCLEARANCES? >> Reporter: YEAH, ERIN, THIS IS\nA DIFFERENT KIND OF FIRST FAMILY MOVING INTO THE WHITE HOUSE COME\nJANUARY. I THINK THAT IS FAIRLY OBVIOUS.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA, HIS TWO YOUNG CHILDREN OBVIOUSLY DID NOT NEED\nTHESE TYPES OF TOP SECRET SECURITY CLEARANCES.\nKEEP IN MIND, DONALD TRUMP'S ADULT CHILDREN, HIS SON-IN-LAW,\nJARED KUSHNER, ARE AMONG HIS TOP ADVISERS.\nWE SAW THIS DURING THE COURSE OF THE CAMPAIGN.\nYOU RECALL JUST LAST WEEK WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS MEETING WITH\nDONALD TRUMP IN THE OVAL OFFICE, JARED KUSHNER WAS TAKING A\nSTROLL WITH THE CURRENT CHIEF OF STAFF ON THE SOUTH LAWN OF THE\nWHITE HOUSE. I'M TOLD BY A TRANSITION SOURCE\nTHAT PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP, YES, HAS ASKED FOR TOP SECRET\nSECURITY CLEARANCES FOR HIS ADULT CHILDREN AND FOR HIS\nSON-IN-LAW, JARED KUSHNER. NOW, KEEP IN MIND, THERE ARE\nOTHER THINGS MOVING ALONG INSIDE THE TRUMP TRANSITION.\nALTHOUGH WE ARE HEARING THAT, AND WE REPORTED THIS LAST WEEK,\nERIN, THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME TENSIONS INSIDE THE TRANSITION\nTEAM. OBVIOUSLY, THERE ARE FACTIONS\nJOCKEYING FOR DIFFERENT POSITIONS, BUT AS ONE OF MY\nCOLLEAGUES, JIM SCIUTTO DESCRIBED IT, THERE'S A BIT OF A\nKNIFE FIGHT, AS HE PUT IT, GOING ON INSIDE THAT TRANSITION.\nHOWEVER, WE SHOULD POINT OUT THIS TEAM IS STARTING TO MAKE\nSOME PROGRESS TOWARD MAKING SOME PRETTY IMPORTANT DECISIONS.\nI'VE BEEN TOLD BY A TRANSITION SOURCE THAT BOTH THE FORMER NEW\nYORK MAYOR RUDY GIULIANI AND FORMER U.N. AMBASSADOR, JOHN\nB BOLTON UNDER GEORGE W. BUSH,\nTHEY'RE THE TWO TOP CON TTENDER FOR SECRETARY OF STATE.\nHEARING ABOUT TENSIONS GOING ON INSIDE THE TRANSITION,\nPOTENTIALLY SOME IN-FIGHTING, THEY ARE GETTING CLOSER TO VERY,\nVERY SIGNIFICANT DECISIONS. ERIN?\n>> ALL RIGHT, JIM SCIUTTO, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nI'M SORRY, JIM ACOSTA. JIM SCIUTTO IS REPORTING ON THE\nKNIFE FIGHT WHICH I'M GOING TO GET TO IN A MOMENT.\nWITH ME NOW, JEFFREY LORD WHO SUPPORTED DONALD TRUMP, AND\nFORMER CLINTON WHITE HOUSE AIDE, KEITH BOYKIN WHO SUPPORTED\nHILLARY CLINTON. FORMER PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER\nDAVID GERGEN ALSO JOINS ME. JEFFREY LORD, LET ME START WITH\nWHAT YOU HEARD JIM ACOSTA TALKS ABOUT, JIM SCIUTTO'S REPORTING.\nOKAY. KNIFE FIGHTS.\nDESCRIBING IT AS A KNIFE FIGHT, IN FACT SAYING THE CONFUSION,\nLACK OF CLARITY OVER WHO'S IN CHARGE BETWEEN REINCE PRIEBUS,\nSTEVE BANNON AND TRUMP'S SON-IN-LAW, JARED KUSHNER IS\nBUFFOONERY. >> AS SOMEBODY WHO WORKED IN THE\nREAGAN ADMINISTRATION, WHAT RONALD REAGAN DID WAS APPOINT\nBAKER AS CHIEF OF STAFF, I.E., REINCE PRIEBUS FIGURE, WHO WAS\nVERY CONTROVERSIAL IN THE DAY AS COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT.\nHE WAS VERY CONSERVATIVE, VERY BANNON LIKE IN THAT SENSE.\nVIEWED BY THE REAGANS AS MANY PEOPLE SAID, AS A SON.\nIN OTHER WORDS, HE HAD THAT PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP AND WAS\nSORT OF IN CHARGE AMONG OTHERS THINGS WITH TRANSLATING RONALD\nAND NANCY REAGAN TO THE REST OF THE WHITE HOUSE STAFF.\n>> YOU MANAGED TO MAKE THE REAGAN ARGUMENT HERE, JEFFREY\nLORD, YOU ALWAYS FIND A WAY. >> JARED KUSHNER WOULD BE\nMICHAEL BEAVER. >> I -- HISTORIAN ALWAYS, REAGAN\nADMINISTRATION, LOOK, THIS IS DICHBT.\nWHAT HAVE WE SAID OVER AND OVER ABOUT THIS CAMPAIGN?\nIT'S UNPRECEDENTED. IT'S DIFFERENT.\nAND I THINK THIS TRANSITION IS VERY DIFFERENT AND I'M HEARING\nTHAT NOT ONLY WITHIN THE GROUP ARE THERE KNIFE FIGHTSS GOING O,\nBUT THERE'S TREMENDOUS PRESSURE COMING FROM OUTSIDE.\nYOU HAVE THE SENATE WHO HAS TO CONFIRM SOME PEOPLE WEIGHING IN\nAND LOBBYING. YOU HAVE THAT, OUR TERM,\nKUSHNER, THE GOP ESTABLISHMENT. NOT IN A BADPROFESSIONALS WHO HE\nBEEN AROUND A LONG TIME. A WORD I WOULDN'T SAY AFTER\nELECTION DAY, THEY WANT TO SEE DONALD TRUMP PIVOT FROM\nCANDIDATE TRUMP -- >> REALLY.\n>> -- TO PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP FINALLY.\nPUTTING THIS CABINET TOGETHER IS VERY IMPORTANT TO A LOT OF\nPEOPLE. >> ON THIS ISSUE, JEFF, OF\nSECURITY CLEARANCES BECAUSE THIS IS SIGNIFICANT AND RELATED,\nRIGHT, YOU HEAR ABOUT WHETHER IT'S A KNIFE FIGHT OR NOT, JARED\nKUSHNER BEING SO INVOLVED, SECURITY CLEARANCES FOR TRUMP'S\nADULT CHILDREN. HAVE WE SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS,\nJAMIE WAS SAYING YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE KENNEDYS TO SEE A\nFAMILY LIKE THIS. >> OF COURSE NOT, THEY DIDN'T\nHAVE SECURITY CLEARANCES. THE ONLY PERSON WHO WILL GET A\nSECURITY CLEARANCE IS IF THEY HAVE A JOB SPECIFIC THAT THEY\nWOULD ABSOLUTELY NEED THAT. SO WE HAVE TO, I THINK, HOLD ON\nJUST A SECOND, SEE WHAT JOBS THEY ACTUALLY GET, BUT ADULT\nCHILD IS NOT GOING TO SIMPLY HAVE A SECURITY CLEARANCE UNLESS\nTHEY HAVE A JOB THAT REQUIRES IT HERE.\nAND IF THEY'RE STILL RUNNING THE BUSINESS, THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER\nARGUMENT. >> WHICH WE ARE GOING TO HAVE\nBECAUSE THAT'S A REALLY SERIOUS CONVERSATION.\nDAVID GERGEN, YOU KNOW, WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA SPOKE TODAY, I\nTHINK YOU COULD BE FORGIVEN FOR BEING COMPLETELY SHOCKED.\nI MEAN, IT WAS NOT EVEN A WEEK AGO HE CALLED DONALD TRUMP UNFIT\nAND WOEFULLY UNPREPARED FOR THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT.\nAND TODAY, I MEAN, THIS IS ALMOST A RINGING ENDORSEMENT.\nHERE'S WHAT HE SAID. >> HE IS COMING TO THIS OFFICE\nWITH FEWER SET HARD AND FAST POLICY PRESCRIPTIONS THAN A LOT\nOF OTHER PRESIDENTS MIGHT BE ARRIVING WITH.\nI DON'T THINK HE IS IDEOLOGICAL. I THINK ULTIMATELY HE'S\nPRAGMATIC IN THAT WAY AND THAT CAN SERVE HIM WELL AS LONG AS\nHE'S GOT GOOD PEOPLE AROUND HIM AND HE HAS A CLEAR SENSE OF\nDIRECTION. >> THIS IS THE ARGUMENT THAT\nTRUMP SUPPORTERS WERE MAKING FOR OVER A YEAR, DAVID GERGEN, NOW\nCOMING FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nHE IS PRAGMATIC AND NOT IDEOLOGICAL.\n>> WELL, I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS TRYING VERY HARD TO BE\nHOPEFUL. TO BE RESPECTFUL.\nTO FOLLOW HILLARY CLINTON'S ADVICE WHICH WAS AFTER ALL, KEEP\nAN OPEN MIND AND WISH HIM THE BEST AS HE GETS STARTED.\nAT THE SAME TIME AS YOU WOULD WELL RECOGNIZE, HE OCCASIONALLY\nNEEDLED HIM A LITTLE BIT. YOU KNOW, HE NEEDLED HIM ON THE\nQUESTION OF HIS TEMPERAMENT AND NEEDLED HIM ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE\nOF SPEAKING OUT AND SENDING SIGNALS OF UNITY AND NEEDLED\nHIM, TOO, ABOUT THE ISSUE OF REMEMBERING BEING RESPECTFUL OF\nNORMS. I THINK THE SENDING OUT THE\nSIGNAL OF UNITY IS MOST IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW IN THE\nDOMESTIC CONTEXT. I WAS ALSO TAKEN, ERIN, BY THE\nFACT THAT THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO EUROPE AND HE'S GOING TO BE\nREASSURING OUR ALLIES THERE, OUR FRIENDS THERE, THAT DONALD TRUMP\nIS STILL COMMITTED TO NATO, COMMITTED TO THE TRANS-ATLANTIC\nPARTNERSHIP. THAT'S IMPORTANT.\nTHERE'S A LOT OF UNREST AS YOU KNOW IN EUROPE AND EUROPEAN\nCAPITALS OVER THAT VERY QUESTION.\nI THOUGHT THAT WAS HELPFUL. >> YES.\n>> I WANT TO SAY ONE LAST THING ABOUT JARED KUSHNER, IF HE TAKES\nA FULL-TIME JOB IN THE WHITE HOUSE, SECURITY CLEARANCE, NO\nBRAINER, OF COURSE HE CAN GET A SECURITY CLEARANCE.\nIF HE'S ON THE OUTSIDE, I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY PRECEDENT FOR A\nMEMBER OF THE FAMILY TO HAVE SECURITY CLEARANCE ON THE\nOUTSIDE. ONE WOULD HAVE TO CHECK THAT.\nI THINK IT'S MUCH MORE UNLIKELY FOR THE THREE CHILDREN.\nTHE PRESIDENT COULD POTENTIALLY APPOINT ONE OF THEM TO, SAY,\nSOMETHING LIKE THE DEFENSE ADVISORY BOARD.\nTHAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A GOOD FIT FOR JARED KUSHNER, BUT IF\nYOU'RE A MEMBER OF THAT BOARD, AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN, YOU CAN\nGET SECURITY CLEARANCE. >> RIGHT.\nTHAT WAS, IF I RECALL, AN ISSUE FOR HILLARY CLINTON DONOR AT ONE\nPOINT. KEITH BOYKIN, LET ME --\n>> YES, EXACTLY. >> WHEN YOU HEAR THE PRESIDENT\nCOME OUT AND SAY HE'S COMING WITH FEWER HARD AND SET POLICY,\nHE'S PRAGMATIC AND NOT IDEOLOGICAL, IS THE PRESIDENT\nSAYING GIVE HIM A SECOND CHANCE ON WHATEVER HE SAID ABOUT\nIMMIGRANTS, WHATEVER HE SAID ABOUT MUSLIMS, WHATEVER HE SAID\nABOUT NATO? BY THE WAY, THE PRESIDENT SAID\nDONALD TRUMP SUPPORTS NATO, SPEAKING FOR DONALD TRUMP.\n>> YEAH. I DON'T THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT\nWAS COMPLIMENTING HIM WHEN HE SAID THAT HE WAS NOT\nIDEOLOGICAL. I FELT HE WAS STATING SORT OF A\nFACT ABOUT WHERE WE ARE.

HE'S PLANNING THE TO HAVE THE\nTHREE GROWN KIDS RUNNING THE BUSINESS EMPIRE.\nTHE IDEA THAT THEY WOULD ALSO BE ADVISING HIM ON NATIONAL\nSECURITY, THAT DOES RAISE A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER ISSUES.\nCAN YOU EXPLAIN JUST THE DETAILS OF A TOP-SECRET -- ASSUMING IT'S\nA TOP-SECRET CLEARANCE -- WHAT KIND OF ACCESS IT GIVES YOU?\n>> Reporter: WHAT I THINK WE SHOULD POINT OUT, THOUGH, IS\nTHAT I DON'T THINK THE ADULT CHILDREN, PERHAPS, SAY, JARED\nKUSHNER, WHO WOULD BE A VERY IMPORTANT ADVISER INSIDE THIS\nWHITE HOUSE, WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE KIND OF OPERATIONAL\nSECURITY INFORMATION THAT YOU WOULD HAVE INSIDE \"THE SITUATION\nROOM,\" INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE, FOR EXAMPLE.\nAND SO THE WAY IT'S BEEN EXPLAINED TO ME, ANDERSON, IS\nTHAT IF THESE ADULT CHILDREN OF DONALD TRUMP ARE IN A SITUATION\nWHERE, PERHAPS, SOME KIND OF SENSITIVE MATERIAL MIGHT BE\nUSEFUL TO THEM, AS PART OF THEIR ADVISING CAPACITY WITH DONALD\nTRUMP, THEIR FATHER, BEING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,\nTHEN PERHAPS THAT INFORMATION MIGHT GET PASSED ALONG TO THEM.\nBUT I DON'T THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE KIND OF VERY SENSITIVE\nINFORMATION THAT WOULD BE HANDLED AT THE TOP NATIONAL\nSECURITY LEVELS, YOU KNOW, LOCATIONS FOR COUNTERTERRORISM\nOPERATIONS AND THAT SORT OF THING.\nBUT ANDERSON, IT SOUNDS LIKE FROM WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM OUR\nOURS INSIDE THE TRANSITION, THIS IS AT THE VERY BEGINNING STAGE\nOF THIS PROCESS. NOT ANYWHERE NEAR THE END.\n>> JIM ACOSTA, THANKS. THE BREAKING NEWS COMES A\nBACKDROP OF CONTROVERSY BECAUSE OF ONE DONALD TRUMP'S WHITE\nHOUSE APPOINTMENTS, NOT REINCE PRIEBUS, BUT PERHAPS TRUMP'S\nCLOSEST POLITICAL ADVISER. MORE ON THAT FROM OUR SARA\nMURRAY. >> Reporter: DONALD TRUMP IS\nALREADY SPARKING OUTRAGE AS HE BUILDS A WHITE HOUSE TEAM WITH\nAN ALT-RIGHT EDGE. >> OUR WORK ON THIS MOVEMENT IS\nREALLY JUST BEGINNING. >> Reporter: THE PRESIDENT-ELECT\nNAMING STEPHEN BANNON, CAMPAIGN CEO AND EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF\nBREITBART NEWS AS HIS CHIEF STRATEGIST AND SENIOR COUNSELOR.\nAND TAPPING REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN, REINCE\nPRIEBUS, AS HIS CHIEF OF STAFF. AS PRIEBUS ARGUES, TRUMP WANTS\nTO BE PRESIDENT FOR ALL. >> IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT\nALL AMERICANS UNDERSTAND THAT HE IS A PRESIDENT FOR EVERYONE.\nHE WANTS TO MAKE EVERYONE PROUD. WHETHER OF YOUR RACE, ETHNIC\nBACKGROUND, GENDER, ANYTHING. >> Reporter: THE BANNON HIRE\nINSTANTLY GREW CRITICISM FROM HATE WATCH GROUPS, WHO HAVE\nNOTED BANNON'S EMBRACE OF THE ALT-RIGHT MOVEMENT, MADE UP OF\nCONSERVATIVES, POPULISTS, WHITE SUPREMACISTS, AND ANTI-SEMITES.\nTHE SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER SAYING TRUMP SHOULD RESCIND THIS\nHIRE.

LET'S DISCUSS THAT.\nGLOBAL ECONOMIST ANALYST RANA FOROOHAR IS HERE, ASSISTANT\nMANAGING EDITOR OF \"TIME\" AND \"WASHINGTON POST\" COLUMNIST JOSH\nROGIN. JOSH, OFF THE BAT DO WE KNOW\nWHAT SORT OF SECURITY CLEARANCE THEY COULD RECEIVE IF IT WERE TO\nBE GRANTED? WHAT THEY WOULD LEARN.\n>> WELL, IT DEPENDS ON WHAT JOB IN THE ADMINISTRATION TRUMP\nWOULD WANT HIS CHILDREN TO HAVE. NOW HE SAID TWO THINGS, HE SAID\nTHEY WILL RUN HIS BUSINESSES AND NOT BE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT\nBUT SECURITY CLEARANCES ARE GRANTED TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE ROLED\nIN THE ADMINISTRATION. THAT'S THE LAW.\nTHERE'S ALSO A LAW CALLED THE NEPOTISM LAW WHICH MEANS YOU\nCAN'T EMPLOY BLOOD RELATIVES IF YOU'RE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES BUT THIS IS UNDETERMINED BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE\nINFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE TRUMP TEAM WANTS TO DO.\n>> BUT FROM WHAT I READ, JOSH, LET ME JUMP IN, BECAUSE OF THE\nNEPOTISM RULE, YOU'RE CORRECT. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY COULDN'T\nRECEIVE THE SECURITY CLEARANCES AND NOT BE EMPLOYEES.\n>> SO IF THEY HAD AN ADVISORY ROLE THEY WOULD HAVE SECURITY\nCLEARANCE BUT ONLY ACCESS TO SPECIFIC INFORMATION ON A\nNEED-TO-KNOW BASIS. JUST HAVING A CLEARANCE DOESN'T\nGET YOU THE INFORMATION SO THE QUESTION THEN IS WHAT WOULD THEY\nBE INVOLVED IN WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE TO USE THE SECURITY\nCLEARANCE AND ONCE THEY HAVE THE SECURITY CLEARANCE THEY WOULD BE\nOBLIGATE BID LAW UNDER PENALTY OF PROSECUTION TO PROTECT THAT\nINFORMATION FROM RELEASED IN ANY FORM PUBLICLY OR PRIVATELY.\n>> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS BECAUSE FROM EVERYTHING I'VE\nSEEN THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED STUFF.\nBUT SERIOUSLY ON THE BUSINESS NOTE, THEY RUN THE BUSINESS,\nBLIND TRUST OVER HERE, WHITE HOUSE OVER HERE.\n>> WELL, THERE IS A HISTORY OF PRESIDENTS PUTTING THEIR ASSETS\nIN BLIND TRUST BUT THE TRUMP SITUATION IS SO UNIQUE BECAUSE\nOF HIS CHILDREN. I THINK UNLESS HE'S VERY CAREFUL\nABOUT -- IN THE BEGINNING SEPARATING OUT POLICY AND\nNATIONAL INTEREST FROM WHAT HIS KIDS MAY OR MAY NOT BE DOING IT\nWILL BE A CONSTANT FOREIGN IN HIS SIDE.\nHE HAS TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT IT IN THE BEGINNING BECAUSE ANY KIND\nOF PERCEPTIONS BUT OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST WILL BE A PROBLEM.\n>> JOSH, CAN YOU IMAGINE WHY THEY WOULD WANT IT?\nWOULD TRUMP WANT THIS? >> IT'S CLEAR WHAT IT WOULD DO.\nIT WOULD ALLOW TRUMP CHILDREN TO HAVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION THEY\nCOULD USE TO MAKE BUSINESS DECISIONS THAT WOULD GIVE THEM A\nCOMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. THAT'S WHY IT'S A CONFLICT OF\nINTEREST. ALSO THEY COULD TELL TRUMP THE\nBUSINESS INFORMATION AND HE COULD USE THAT TO MAKE AMERICA\nNATIONAL SECURITY POLICY. SO IT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA.\nNOW RUDY GIULIANI SAID TO JAKE TAPPER ON STATE OF THE UNION ON\nSUNDAY THAT THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST LAWS DON'T APPLY TO THE\nPRESIDENT. THAT'S TECHNICALLY TRUE BUT NOT\nSOMETHING YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SAY AND NOT AN INDICATION THAT THE\nTRUMP ADMINISTRATION PLANS TO TAKE A STRICT POLICY TOWARDS\nAVOIDING THESE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.\n>> AND THIS IS THE TRUMP TRANSITION TEAM ASKING THE\nPOSSIBILITY.

RISEN TO WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS\nTO SAY. REFERENDUM ON COMPLEX\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GREAT BRITAIN AND THE REST OF EUROPE\nAND A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN THE UNITED STATES.\nYOU KNOW, PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS ALWAYS TURN ON PERSONALITIES.\nTHEY TURN ON HOW CAMPAIGNS ARE RUN.\nTHEY TURN ON NATURAL DESIRES FOR CHANGE IF, YOU HAD AN INCUMBENT\nWHO HAS BEEN THERE FOR EIGHT YEARS.\nTHERE IS TEMPTATION TO THINK, WELL LET'S MAYBE MAKE A CHANGE.\nTHERE ARE A WHOLE RANGE OF FACTORS INVOLVED.\nBUT I DO THINK THAT THERE IS A COMMON THEME THAT WE'VE SEEN IN\nA LOT OF ADVANCED ECONOMIES AND THAT WE'VE SEEN AROUND THE\nWORLD. ALTHOUGH THEY MANIFEST\nTHEMSELVES IN DIFFERENT WAYS. GLOBALIZATION COMBINED WITH\nTECHNOLOGY, COMBINED WITH SOCIAL MEDIA, AND CONSTANT INFORMATION\nHAS DISRUPTED PEOPLE'S LIVES, SOMETIMES IN VERY CONCRETE WAYS.\nMANUFACTURING PLANT CLOSES AND SUDDENLY AN ENTIRE TOWN NO\nLONGER HAS WHAT WAS THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF EMPLOYMENT.\nBUT ALSO PSYCHOLOGICALLY. PEOPLE ARE LESS CERTAIN OF, OF\nTHEIR NATIONAL IDENTITIES OR THEIR PLACE IN THE WORLD.\nIT STARTS LOOKING DIFFERENT AND DISORIENTING.\nAND, THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THAT HAS PRODUCED POPULIST MOVEMENTS\nBOTH FROM THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT IN MANY COUNTRIES IN EUROPE WHEN\nYOU SEE A DONALD TRUMP AND A BERNIE SANDERS, VERY\nUNCONVENTIONAL CANDIDATES, HAVE CONSIDERABLE SUCCESS THAN\nOBVIOUSLY THERE IS SOMETHING THERE THAT IS BEING TAPPED INTO.\nA SUSPICION OF GLOBALIZATION, A DESIRE TO REIN IN ITS EXCESSES.\nA SUSPICION OF ELITES AND GOVERNING INSTITUTIONS THAT\nPEOPLE FEEL MAY NOT BE RESPONSIVE TO THEIR IMMEDIATE\nNEEDS. AND THAT SOMETIMES GETS WRAPPED\nUP IN ISSUES OF ETHNIC IDENTITY OR RELIGIOUS IDENTITY OR\nCULTURAL IDENTITY. THAT CAN BE A VOLATILE MIX.\nIT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THOUGH THAT THOSE TRENDS HAVE\nALWAYS BEEN THERE, AND IT IS THE JOB I THINK OF LEADERS TO TRY TO\n, PEOPLE'S REAL LEGITIMATE CONCERNS AND CHANNELED THE MOST\nCONSTRUCTIVE WAYS POSSIBLE. DID I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE WAS\nANGER OR FRUSTRATION IN THE AMERICAN POPULATION?\nOF COURSE I DID. FIRST OF ALL THAT WE HAD TO\nFIGHT BACK SINCE THE WORST RECESSION SINCE THE GREAT\nDEPRESSION. IF YOUR HOUSING VALUES CRASHED\nAND YOU LOST MOST OF YOUR PENSION AND YOU LOST YOUR JOB\nYOU WILL BE PRETTY ANGRY. SO WE FOUGHT BACK BUT THAT LEFT\nFEAR AND ANXIETY IN A LOT OF PEOPLE.\nTHAT THE ECONOMY WASN'T AS CERTAIN AS IT COULD BE AND MAYBE\nTHE GAME WAS RIGGED ON WALL STREET OR BY SPECIAL\nINTERESTS IN WASHINGTON OR WHAT HAVE YOU, AND THAT'S BEEN THERE.\nI WAS ALSO AWARE BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THAT YOU HAVE SEEN\nSOME OF THE RHETORIC AMONG REPUBLICAN ELECTED OFFICIALS AND\nACTIVISTS AND MEDIA. SOME OF IT, PRETTY TROUBLING,\nAND NOT NECESSARILY CONNECTED TO FACTS BUT, BEING USED\nEFFECTIVELY TO MOBILIZE PEOPLE. AND OBVIOUSLY PRESIDENT-ELECT\nTRUMP TAPPED INTO THAT PARTICULAR STRAIN WITHIN THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY AND THEN WAS ABLE TO BROADEN THAT ENOUGH AND\nGET ENOUGH VOTES TO WIN THE ELECTION.\nTHE LESSON I DRAW, AND I THINK PEOPLE CAN DRAW A LOT OF\nLESSONS, BUT MAYBE ONE THAT CUTS ACROSS COUNTRIES IS, WE HAVE TO\nDEAL WITH ISSUES LIKE INEQUALITY, WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH\nISSUES OF ECONOMIC DISLOCATION, WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE'S\nFEARS THAT THEIR CHILDREN WON'T DO AS WELL AS THEY HAVE.\nTHE MORE AGGRESSIVELY AND EFFECTIVELY WE DEAL WITH THOSE\nISSUES, THE LESS, THOSE FEARS MAY CHANNEL THEMSELVES INTO\nCOUNTERPRODUCT TIFF APPROACHES. THAT PIT PEOPLE AGAINST EACH\nOTHER. AND FRANKLY THAT HAS BEEN MY\nAGENDA FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS. I THINK RAISING WAGES, INVESTING\nIN INFRASTRUCTURE, MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO GOOD\nEDUCATIONS THAT EQUIP THEM FOR JOBS OF FUTURE, THOSE ARE ALL\nAGENDA ITEMS THAT WOULD HELP ALLEVIATE SOME OF THOSE ECONOMIC\nPRESSURES AND DISLOCATIONS THAT PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING.\nTHE PROBLEM WAS I COULDN'T CONVINCE A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS\nTO PASS A LOT OF THEM. NOW HAVING SAID THAT, PEOPLE\nSEEM TO THINK I DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB, AND SO THERE IS THIS\nMISS MATCH I THINK BETWEEN FRUSTRATION AND ANGER, PERHAPS\nTHE VIEW OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WAS IS THAT JUST NEED TO SHAKE\nTHINGS UP. >> THOSE FOLKS WHO VOTED FOR THE\nPRESIDENT-ELECT ARE BETTER OFF THAN WHEN I CAME INTO OFFICE.\nWE'LL SEE WHETHER THOSE FACTS EFFECT PEOPLE'S CALCULATIONS IN\nTHE NEXT ELECTION. >> YOU ASKED -- I BELIEVE ANGELA\nMERKEL COULD BE CONVINCED TO MAKE BUT WHICH ARE THE NECESSARY\nSTEPS FOR THE RECOVERY OF THE GREEK ECONOMY.\nTHE ANSWER IS I'M VERY OPTIMISTIC.\nANGELA MERKEL IS A GERMAN POLITICIAN.\nAND GERMANS INSIST SOMETIMES, SOMETIMES --\nBILL: A PRETTY FASCINATING POSTMORTEM.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA A MOMENT AGO SUGGESTING THAT PEOPLE SEEM TO\nTHINK I DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB.

REALITY HAS A WAY OF ASSERTING\nITSELF. BUT THIS PRESIDENT HAS AGREED IN\nA SENSE TO BE A MENTOR, DESPITE ALL OF THE ILL WILL.\n>> BECAUSE THIS PRESIDENT IS PUTTING COUNTRY AHEAD OF PARTY.\nWHICH WE DID NOT SEE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY DO THROUGHOUT\nTHIS CAMPAIGN AND WHEN WE CONSIDER THE LEGACY OF BARACK\nOBAMA, THIS MOMENT WHICH IS CLEARLY DIFFICULT FOR HIM\nPERSONALLY WILL HAVE TO BE PART OF IT THAT HE IS A CALMING FORCE\nFOR THE COUNTRY SAYING IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.\nLET'S GIVE HIM A CHANCE. SOME MAY SAY, WE DON'T WANT TO.\n>> BUT ALSO PROCESSING HOW HIS PARTY LOST.\nHE'S NOT SAYING THAT THIS WAS RIGGED.\nHE'S SAYING THIS IS HOW IT WAS LOST.\n>> YES. AND HE'S ALSO NOT BACKING DOWN\nFROM THE THINGS HE SAID BEFORE RIGHT WHEN HE WAS ON THE\nCAMPAIGN TRAIL BUT HE'S SAYING, THE ELECTION IS OVER, WE NEED TO\nMOVE ON. EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT FROM OUR\nPRESIDENT. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, TOURE,\nFOR JOINING US. KELLY O'DONNELL ON CAPITOL HILL\nWITH SOME NEW NEWS REGARDING THE SCHEDULE FOR TRUMP AND PENCE\nTODAY.

WHAT HAS BASICALLY HAPPENED\nSINCE 2012 AND THE PASSAGE OF LEGISLATION TO SMOOTH\nTRANSITIONS IS THAT THERE'S BEEN A WELL-FUNDED TRANSITION\nESTABLISHED. THAT TRANSITION OPERATES OUTSIDE\nOF THE CAMPAIGN STRUCTURE. SO, THERE IS A NATURAL SORTING\nOUT WHEN THE ACTUAL ELECTION CURSE AND THE NEW ADMINISTRATION\nPREPARES TO TAKE OVER.

OUR JOHN HARWOOD JOINS US NOW\nWITH MORE ON THAT DEVELOPING STORY AND DEVELOPING EVERY\nMOMENT, JOHN. >> IT'S DEVELOPING RAPIDLY,\nDAVID. FIRST OF ALL, LET'S JUST TALK\nABOUT A COUPLE OF THE BIG JOBS. TREASURY SECRETARY, WE DON'T\nKNOW WHETHER A DECISION HAS BEEN MADE, BUT A FORMER GOLDMAN SACHS\nEXEC EXECUTIVE, HEAD OF FUND-RAISING\nFOR THE CAMPAIGN JUST ARRIVED AT TRUMP TOWER AND SOUNDED VERY\nMUCH LIKE A TREASURY SECRETARY IN WAITING, EVEN THOUGH HE SAID\nHE WASN'T GOING TO COMMENT. HE SAID HE WAS WORKING WITH THE\nTRANSITION TEAM ON GETTING THE BIGGEST TAX CUT SINCE RONALD\nREAGAN. DIDN'T RULE HIMSELF IN OR OUT,\nBUT THERE'S A LOT OF SPECULATION THAT THAT IS IN PROCESS.\nIN TERMS OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE JOB, A LOT OF TALK ABOUT\nRUDY GIULIANI. THIS IS SOMEONE WHO DOES NOT\nHAVE DIPLOMATIC EXPERIENCE. OF COURSE HE HAS LAW ENFORCEMENT\nEXPERIENCE AND HE WAS THE MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY.\nHE WAS U.S. ATTORNEY AND WORKED IN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DURING\nTHE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION. BUT THAT IS ONE THAT WOULD BE\nSOMEONE NEW TO THE REALM OF DIPLOMACY.\nNOW, THERE'S ALSO A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TURMOIL WITHIN THE\nTRUMP TRANSITION TEAM, ESPECIALLY ON NATIONAL SECURITY,\nWHICH IS VERY CONCERNING TO REPUBLICAN VETERANS OF NATIONAL\nSECURITY POLICY. MIKE ROGERS,HE HOUSE INTELLIGEN\nCOMMITTEE, ABRUPTLY RESIGNED FROM THE TRANSITION TEAM THIS\nMORNING, SAYING THAT HE WAS TURNING OVER THAT PROCESS TO\nMIKE PENCE AND THE TRUMP FAMILY AND OTHERS.\nTHIS IS BELIEVED PRIVATELY BY THOSE CLOSE TO THE TRANSITION TO\nBE A REFLECTION OF A WHAT IS DESCRIBED AS A PURGE OF THOSE\nPEOPLE CLOSE TO CHRIS CHRISTIE WHO FORMERLY HEADED THE\nTRANSITION, BUT WAS DEMOTED IN FAVOR OF MIKE PENCE, WHO IS NOW\nLEADING IT OVER THE WEEKEND. NOW, IN ADDITION TO THAT, YOU\nHAD ELLIOTT COHEN OF JOHNS HOPKINS WHO WAS A\nNEOCONSERVATIVE, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR TO THE BUSH\nADMINISTRATION AND A PROMINENT REPUBLICAN VOICE, CONSERVATIVE\nVOICE IN NATIONAL SECURITY, PUTTING OUT A TWEET THIS MORNING\nSAYING THAT MY PREVIOUS ADVICE IS REVERSED.\nHE SAID HE HAD TOLD PEOPLE TO COOPERATE WITH THE TRUMP\nTRANSITION. NOW HE SAYS STAY AWAY, THEY'RE\nANGRY, THEY'RE SCREAMING YOU LOST, WE WON.\nAND THE SUGGESTION OVERALL OF THIS TURMOIL IS THERE'S A VERY\nSMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY CLOSE TO DONALD TRUMP, BOTH\nIN TERMS OF SURROGATES LIKE CHRISTIE, GIULIANI AND OTHERS,\nNOT A BIG POLICY BREADTH TO HIS ADVISERS AND IT IS LOOKING LIKE\nIT'S A DIFFICULT PROCESS OF STAFFING UP THE GOVERNMENT,\nGUYS. >> YEAH, JOHN, INTERESTING.\nYOU MAY NOT GET A LOT OF THOSE TYPICAL PEOPLE WHO WOULD JOIN A\nREPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATION ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS.\nSOME, I THINK, ARE SAYING IF YOU'RE ASKED, IT'S YOUR\nPATRIOTIC DUTY, BUT IT DOES APPEAR GIVEN THAT TWEET WE JUST\nSAW THAT OTHERS ARE GOING TO HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT VIEW OF\nIT, AREN'T THEY? >> EXACTLY RIGHT.\nAND WHEN I TALK TO PEOPLE BOTH IN THE OUTGOING OBAMA\nADMINISTRATION, PEOPLE WHO USED TO BE IN THE BUSH\nADMINISTRATION, PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR SOME MEASURE OF\nCONTINUITY IN FOREIGN POLICY AND NATIONAL SECURITY.\nYOU KNOW, YOU'RE LOOKING FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE AND\nARE FAMILIAR WITH THESE ISSUES AND THE PLAYERS INVOLVED.\nTHE NUMBER OF PEOPLE CLOSE TO DONALD TRUMP WHO FIT THAT\nCATEGORY IS NOT LARGE.

IT'S SORT OF THE TYPICAL\nJOCKEYING, BUT IT IS JOCKEYING ON STEROIDS BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE\nGENUINELY DIDN'T THINK THEY WOULD BE HERE.\nTHEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE GOING OFF ON THEIR MERRY WAY, HAVING\nTHEIR LIVES RETURNING TO NORMALCY, AND HILLARY CLINTON\nWOULD BE DOING A TRANSITION. AND THAT'S NOT HAPPENING.\n>> I THINK DANA IS CLOSER ON.

THERE'S ALWAYS A CONFLICT,\nEVERYBODY TRYING TO JOCKEY AND SHOW THEIR WORTH TO THE MAN OR\nWHOEVER IS AT THE TOP OF THE ADMINISTRATION.\nSO THERE'S SOME OF THAT. AND THEN THERE'S THIS OTHER\nTHING THAT I DON'T THINK SQUARES THAT ACCURATELY WITH MY\nREPORTING, WHICH IS THIS IDEA OF CALLING BANNON AN OUTSIDER.\nEVEN ON THIS NETWORK, YOU HEAR THE INSIDER IN REINCE PRIEBUS\nAND THE OUTSIDER IN BANNON. HE'S NOT AN OUTSIDER.\nYOU JUST HEARD GLENN BECK SAY HE'S A NIGHTMARE.\n>> THE COOL-HEADED GLENN BECK IS NOW WEIGHING IN.\n>> NOW ACTING AS CHARACTER REFERENCE.\n>> GLEN BECK IS SAYING THIS GUY IS SOMETHING TOTALLY OUTSIDE THE\nSPHERE OF NORMAL. THIS REPORTING THAT, WOW,\nTHEY'RE REALLY KILLING EACH OTHER IN THERE, NOT TRUE.\nTHIS IDEA HE'S JUST A REGULAR OUTSIDER SO IT'S LIKE A TYPICAL\nBALANCE OF INFLUENCES, NOT TRUE. >> THERE'S NOTHING TYPICAL HERE.\n>> THERE'S NOTHING NORMAL ABOUT THIS ELECTION OR THIS\nTRANSITION. TO DANA'S POINT, NORMALLY\nTRANSITIONS HAVE BEEN METHODICALLY PLANNED.\nTHIS ONE WAS TREATED AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT FOR A NUMBER OF\nREASONS. THAT INCREASES THE CHAOS.\nYOU CAN CALL IT A SCRUM, CALL IT A KNIFE FIGHT IF YOU WANT TO BE\nDRAMATIC. YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO\nSEE UNUSUAL OPPORTUNITIES WITH MASSIVE AMBITION TRYING TO CURRY\nFAVOR WHILE THE CLOCK TICKS.

JEFF SESSIONS, JIM TALENTED,\nJOHN KYL, DUNCAN HUNTER JR., BOB CORKER.\n>> SARAH MURRAY AND I WERE BOTH TOLD BY SOURCES WHO WERE\nINVOLVED IN THIS YESTERDAY THAT JEFF SESSIONS IS NOW MUCH MORE\nLIKELY TO BE ATTORNEY GENERAL. >> THAN GIULIANI?\n>> WELL, DEFINITELY THAN GIULIANI.\nGIULIANI, WE WERE TOLD -- RUDY GIULIANI, AND YOU'\nTHIS, BUT WHAT RUDY GIULIANI WANTS, RUDY GIULIANI GETS.\nAND HE WANTS SECRETARY OF STATE. I WAS TOLD THAT PEOPLE ARE\nASSUMING THAT HE'S GOING TO GO TO THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT.\nIT'S MUCH MORE LIKELY THE FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY, FORMER JUDICIARY\nCHAIR IS GOING TO BE TAPPED FOR A.G.\n>> IS IT TRUE THAT WHAT RUDY WANTS, RUDY GETS?\n>> I THINK TRUMP'S BEEN VERY O\nOPEN ABOUT THE FACT THAT RUDY WAS WITH HIM WHEN OTHER PEOPLE\nWEREN'T. HE DIDN'T RUN FOR THE EXITS WHEN\nTHE \"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD\" TAPE CAME DOWN.\nHE WAS LOYAL, ENTHUSIASTIC, AND THAT CREATES LOYALTY ON TRUMP'S\nPART. I THINK WHAT PEOPLE DON'T\nAPPRECIATE ABOUT RUDY, AND I DID WORK FOR HIM FOR MANY YEARS WHEN\nHE WAS MAYOR OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK, IS IN THE MEANTIME WHILE\nHE'S DEEPLY VERSED IN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, WORKED IN\nREAGAN'S JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, HE HAS REALLY SPENT A LOT OF THE\nLAST TEN YEARS TRAVELING THE WORLD ON INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS.\nTHAT'S REALLY BEEN THE FIELD THAT MOST FASCINATED HIM, EVEN\nWITH HIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, WHICH I WORKED ON IN POLICY.\nIT'S THE INTERNATIONAL SPHERE THAT'S FASCINATED RUDY GIULIANI\nIN THE WAKE OF 9/11 AND THE WAY FOLKS MIGHT NOT SEE ON THE\nSURFACE. >> NOW, THE CONFUSING PART OF\nTHIS PICTURE IS HE CAME ON THE SHOW, SEEMED TO BE MAKING A CASE\nFOR A.G. I WAS TOLD AFTERWARDS THAT HE\nWAS ONLY TALKING IN THE PERSONAL CONTEXT, NOT THE PROFESSIONAL\nCONTEXT. HE SAID, WELL, LOOK, IF YOU ASK\nME ABOUT ME, I'M VERY QUALIFIED TO BE ATTORNEY GENERAL.\nI NEVER SAID I WANTED IT. I JUST TOLD YOU I WAS VERY\nQUALIFIED. >> PROBABLY OBJECTIVE.\n>> THE WORD IS THAT HE ALSO -- NOT ONLY IS HE INTERESTED IN THE\nPOLICY AND SUBSTANCE OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE,\nTHAT ATTORNEY GENERAL IS MORE OF A BEEN THERE, DONE THAT, MAYBE\nBENEATH HIM. >> BUT HOW MANY POLITICAL HEAVY\nWEIGHTS DOES THE PRESIDENT-ELECT HAVE TO PUT AROUND HIM?\n>> NOT MANY. >> NONE OF THIS IS NORMAL, BUT\nTHIS TRANSITION, YOU KNOW -- THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGN HAD PERHAPS\nPRESUMPTUOUSLY BEEN READY. >> THEY ARE TRYING TO REACH\nOUTSIDE, TO YOUR POINT, THE VERY SMALL SPHERE OF TRUMP WORLD AND\nTRY TO SEE WHO IS WILLING TO COME IN AND PEOPLE WHO MIGHT NOT\nNORMALLY BE TRUMP, YOU KNOW, SORT OF POLITICAL PEOPLE.\n>> AND HOW'S THAT GOING? >> WE'LL SEE.\n>> IT'S ALSO A WEIRD THING WHEN YOU WALK INTO THE ROOM.\nYOU WALK IN FOR ONE OF THESE INTERVIEWS.\nLET'S SAY YOU'RE JAMIE DIMON. HEY, REINCE, HOW YOU DOING?\nYOU LOOK OVER THERE, AND THERE'S STEVE BANNON, WHO MIGHT AS WELL\nHAVE A BIG BLACK CAPE ON FOR A LOT OF THESE GUYS.\n>> THAT'S PAUL MANAFORT WITH THE CAPE.\n>> HIS HAD RED LINING ON THE INSIDE.\nHIS IS ALL BLACK. >> THESE ARE COALITIONS THAT\nREFLECT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND SOME COULD ARGUE THE STATE OF\nTHE PARTY. THE BAGGAGE THAT COMES WITH\nBREITBART IS UNUSUAL BY ANY MEASURE.\nBANNON HAS UNABASHED ABOUT TRYING TO INHERIT THE MANTLE AND\nDO A BURN DOWN THE ESTABLISHMENT APPROACH TO POLITICS.\nA LOT OF THE FOLKS AROUND THAT HAVE BEEN ADVOCATES OF WHITE\nIDENTITY POLITICS. THAT'S A PROBLEM.\n>> I KNEW ANDREW BREITBART A LITTLE BIT.\nTHIS IS WAY BEYOND WHAT HE WANTED.\n>> OH, YEAH. >> HE DIDN'T DO ANY OF THE\nRACIALLY TINGED HEADLINES. >> HE ALWAYS REFUSED TO JOIN THE\nBIRTHER CROWD. HE REJECTED THAT AT THE TIME.\n>> ALL RIGHT. STICK AROUND.\nWE HAVE MANY MORE QUESTIONS.", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1479212212592.1479209545694.2c90929a-ec59-4cf2-8dc8-d142cce80165.segment0.thumb.jpg", "channel": "202"}, {"start": 0, "length": 209879.0, "end": 209879, "date": 1479220377748, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1479223386817.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1479220364040-3854d549-b23e-47f4-a6d6-6ae5c0b59e97-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=0.00,209.88", "text": "ACROSS DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN\nADMINISTRATIONS.

LAST NIGHT HE SHOT IT DOWN\nSAYING HE WOULD NOT BE A.G. IN A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.\nHE LEFT REPORTERS GUESSING ABOUT SECRETARY OF STATE.\nLISTEN TO WHAT NEWT GINGRICH SAID ABOUT IT LATE LAST NIGHT.\n>> RUDY'S PROBABLY BEEN THE CLOSEST SURROGATE, WORKED HIS\nHEART OUT. I THOUGHT HE MIGHT PREFER\nATTORNEY GENERAL WHERE HE WOULD BE BRILLIANT OR HOMELAND\nSECURITY WHERE HIS EXPERIENCE AT 9/11 WOULD BE GREAT.\nI THINK HE'LL BE FABULOUS TO HAVE HIM AS SECRETARY OF STATE.\nHE WOULD DO A LOT TO REPRESENT AMERICA, WHICH IS WHAT WE NEED,\nAND TO REFORM THE STATE DEPARTMENT.\n>> ANOTHER TOP CONTENDER IS ALABAMA SENATOR JEFF SESSIONS,\nONE OF TRUMP'S EARLIEST AND MOST LOYAL SUPPORTERS.\nTHIS IS BY NO MEANS A DONE DEAL YET.\nTHEY HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION VERY SOON.\nTHERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PERHAPS\nNOT DIVERSE ENOUGH.

HE HAS WON.\nHE'S GOING TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT.\nAND REGARDLESS OF WHAT EXPERIENCE OR ASSUMPTIONS HE\nBROUGHT TO THE OFFICE, THIS OFFICE HAS A WAY OF WAKING YOU\nUP. THOSE ASPECTS OF HIS POSITIONS\nOR PREDISPOSITIONS THAT DON'T MATCH UP WITH REALITY, HE WILL\nFIND SHAKEN UP PRETTY QUICK BECAUSE REALITY HAS A WAY OF\nASSERTING ITSELF. >> I THOUGHT IT WAS DIPLOMATIC,\nHE SAID THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS HE WON'T BE ABLE TO DO WHEN HE\nGETS TO THE 0E68 OFFICE.

BEING INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE, HE\nDID A NICE JOB ON THE PODIUM. I THOUGHT HE WAS GRACIOUS AND\nSAID ALL THE RIGHT THINGS TO HEAR.\n>> HE DID A NICE JOB. ALSO, THERE'S A LOT OF PROOF\nRIGHT NOW OR EVIDENCE THAT THERE'S A PUBLIC POSITION AND\nTHERE'S A PRIVATE POSITION IN THE WHITE HOUSEMENT PUBLICLY,\nHE'S SAYING THE RIGHT THING.

I ALONE, ONE OTHER PERSON, WERE\nTHE ONLY ONES TO WIN FOR THE DEMOCRATS ON A NATIONAL BASIS.\nNEXT THING YOU KNOW I'M PRESIDENT, WE'VE GOT THE HOUSE\nAND SENATE BACK. THEN HE ALSO SAID THIS WHEN IT\nCOMES TO THE DEMOCRATS, THEY HAVE TO LEARN TO COMPETE\nEVERYWHERE. LISTEN.\n>> WE HAVE TO COMPETE EVERYWHERE.\nWE HAVE TO SHOW UP EVERYWHERE. WE HAVE TO WORK AT A GRASSROOTS\nLEVEL, SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN A RUNNING THREAD IN MY CAREER.\nYOU KNOW, I WON IOWA NOT BECAUSE THE DEMOGRAPHICS DICTATED THAT I\nWOULD WIN IOWA. IT WAS BECAUSE I SPENT 87 DAYS\nGOING TO EVERY SMALL TOWN AND FAIR AND FISH FRY AND VFW.\n>> WHAT HE'S IMPLYING? >> THAT'S A SHOT AT HILLARY\nCLINTON WHO DID NOT PUT THE TIME AND EFFORT IN ON THE GROUND.\n>> WHO DIDN'T GO TO THE FISH FRIES.\n>> SHE ASSUMED IT WAS HERS TO BE HAD.\nDONALD TRUMP IS DOING FIVE RALLIES A DAY AT THE END OF THE\nELECTION ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO THE FINISH LINE.\nWHETHER IT WAS STAMINA OR A CHOICE, HILLARY CLINTON WASN'T.\n>> LOOK AT THE CROWDS. WHOSE RALLY WAS THAT DOWN IN\nFLORIDA, THAT WAS TIM KAINE'S RALLY WHERE ONLY 30 PEOPLE\nSHOWED UP. DONALD TRUMP WAS FILLING\nSTADIUMS, GETTING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.\n>> THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT.

HE'S MORE PRAGMATIC THAN\nTHAT WE ARE HEARING FROM PEOPLE IN TRUMP TOWER AND PEOPLE IN THE\nTRANSITION EFFORT WHICH IS THAT PRESIDENT ELECT TRUMP IS VERY\nSERIOUS ABOUT ROLLING BACK A LOT OF THE OBAMA ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE\nLAST SEVERAL YEARS BY EXECUTIVE ACTION IF NECESSARY.\nTHE STUNNING DISCONNECT THAT, I THINK, REALLY SHOWS THE FULL\nEXTENT OF THE LAW HASN'T SUNK IN YET AND REPUDIATION OF HILLARY\nCLINTON.  JENNA: DANIEL, WHAT'S YOUR TAKE?\n>> I DON'T THINK IT'S DENIAL. WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA IS TRYING\nTO MAKE THE CASE FOR HIS OWN POLICIES.\nAFTERWARDS DONALD TRUMP SEEMED TO SOFTEN A LITTLE BIT ON\nOBAMACARE IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE WALL STREET JOURNAL AND SOME\nTHINGS THAT WERE GOOD AND PRAISED OBAMA AND WHAT PRESIDENT\nOBAMA IS DOING IS MAKING THE CASE FOR HIS OWN LEGACY AND FOR\nHIS OWN CONTINUITY. I THINK ON A HUMAN -- ON A\nPERSON TO PERSON LEVEL PRESIDENT OBAMA REALIZES THAT IF HE CAN\nDEAL WITH DONALD TRUMP AND BE GRACEFUL AND KIND WHICH HE HAS\nBEEN TO DONALD TRUMP SINCE THE ELECTION THAT MAYBE DONALD TRUMP\nONCE IN OFFICE WILL SEE THE WISDOM OF WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA\nHAS DONE AND HE MAYBE -- IT'S HARD TO TELL, HE MAYBE SLIGHTLY\nSUCCESSFUL SO FAR BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT IT'S DELUSION, I THINK\nIT'S A STRATEGY AND I THINK IT MAY WORK.\nJENNA: INTERESTING.

I'M NOT A WEAPONS INSPECTOR.\nI CAN'T TELL YOU. >> RIGHT.\n>> WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE. >> WELL, THE IAEA IN FOUR SERIES\nOF REPORTS HAVE SAID THEY HAVE INDEED COMPLIED WITH THE\nAGEMENT. IT IS KEEPING IRAN FROM\nOBTAINING A NUCLEAR WEAPON AND EVEN THE INTELLIGENCE ANALYSTS\nIN ISRAEL AND POLITICAL LEADERSHIP IN ISRAEL WAS AGAINST\nTHIS AGREEMENT HAVE SAID ISRAEL IS MORE SECURE FOR AT LEAST THE\nNEXT DECADE.

WHEN YOU HAVE FRINGE GROUPS\nSUPPORTING SOMEONE, I DON'T THINK YOU CAN TIE THEIR SUPPORT\nINTO SAYING THE PERSON THEY'RE SUPPORTING BELIEVES IN THAT.\nWE SAW OTHER SUPPORT GROUPS THAT CAME IN AND SAID WE'RE\nSUPPORTING DONALD TRUMP. >> THEY APPARENTLY SEE AN\nADVOCATE IN THE WEST WING. >> THEN THEY'RE MISTAKEN,\nBECAUSE STEVE BANNON'S JOB IS TO DEVELOP A STRATEGY TO IMPLEMENT\nTHE VISION OF DONALD TRUMP TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN FOR ALL\nAMERICANS AND UNITE THE COUNTRY THAT WE HAVE TO ADMIT IS MORE\nDIVIDED TODAY THAN EVER, WHETHER IT'S BLACKS, WHITES, HISPANICS,\nAND IT'S NOT STEVE BANNON'S VISION, IT'S THE VISION OF THE\nPRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES.\n>> DO YOU AGREE WITH DONALD TRUMP THAT SAME-SEX MARRIAGE,\nGAY MARRIAGE IS ALREADY LAW AND IT'S GOING TO STAY THAT WAY?\n>> YES, I AGREE WITH THAT. >> WHAT ABOUT ABORTION RIGHTS\nFOR WOMEN? HE SAID THAT IS NOT SETTLED LAW.\nHE WOULD LIKE TO APPOINT WHAT HE CALLS PRO-LIFE JUSTICES AND LET\nROE V. WADE GO BACK TO THE STATES, LET EACH STATE DECIDE\nWHETHER THERE SHOULD BE ABORTION RIGHTS FOR WOMEN?\n>> I'M A BIG DEFENDER OF THE 10th AMENDMENT, AND THESE ARE\nTHINGS THAT SOMETIMES WE CAN AGREE TO DISAGREE.\nI WOULD SAY CERTAINLY WHAT WE HAVE TO DO FIRST IS AGREE ON\nENDING THE LATE TERM, LATE TRIMESTER PARTIAL BIRTH\nABORTION. WE HAVE TO GET RID OF THAT ONCE\nAND FOR ALL. WE ARE HUMAN BEINGS TO BEGIN\nWITH. I JUST AM SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES\nROE V. WADE HAS BEEN SETTLED IN THIS COUNTRY SO VERY LONG, I\nWOULD NOT RIGHT NOW LOOK TO OVERTURN IT, BUT WE'VE GOT TO\nMAKE SURE THAT WE SAY THERE ARE RIGHTS THAT A FETUS HAS, AND\nCERTAINLY HAS WE ENTER THE THIRD TRIMESTER, ABORTION SHOULD BE\nABSOLUTELY OUTLAWED UNLESS IT IS THE LIFE OF THE MOTHER.\n>> ROE V. WADE, SINCE 1973, IT'S BEEN THE LAW OF THE LAND SINCE\nTHEN. THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, VERY\nINTRIGUING ARTICLE, SAY DONALD TRUMP'S AIDES SEEM TO BE UNAWARE\nTHAT THERE ARE THREE OR FOUR THOUSAND JOBS THAT NEED TO BE\nFILLED BETWEEN NOW AND JANUARY 20, ESPECIALLY IN THE WEST WING\nAND THE WHITE HOUSE STAFF, THAT THIS WAS A WAKE-UP CALL FOR\nTHEM. THEY REALLY DID NOT KNOW.\nHAVE YOU HEARD THAT? >> NO, I HAVE NOT HEARD THAT,\nBUT WHEN YOU'RE FOCUSED ON THE ELECTION LIKE WE ARE, YOU HAVE A\nSMALL CIRCLE ADVISERS THAT DONALD TRUMP HAD.\nI WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED -- I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT NUMBER, BUT\nEVEN I WAS SURPRISED WHEN I HEARD.\nTHAT'S A LOT OF JOBS, THEY HAVE TO BE VETDS, THEIR BACKGROUNDS,\nTHE 15 SILOS, DEEP DIVING, THEY'RE ADDING A LOT OF PEOPLE\nTO DO THAT VETTING, AND I'M SURE THEY'LL LOOK AT THE EXECUTIVE\nCOMMITTEE ONCE THAT'S DONE TO LOOK AT THE INDIVIDUALS AND MAKE\nOUR OWN RECOMMENDATIONS. BUT LET'S BE CLEAR, THESE WILL\nBE DECISIONS MADE BY PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP\nWITH ADVICE FROM ALL OF US, BUT CLEARLY NOW REINCE PRIEBUS ASAN\nSTEVE VANCE BOTH WILL BE WORKING TO GET THAT UNDER CONTROL.\n>> NO DOUBT YOU'RE A VERY HAPPY MAN.\n>> AMERICA SHOULD BE HAPPY.", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1479167006635.1479162889720.84fdc7f8-7751-4bbd-adf7-dadc0d848ee6.segment1.thumb.jpg", "channel": "202"}, {"start": 0, "length": 160842.0, "end": 160842, "date": 1479164757356, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1479169341316.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1479164695112-67eff49f-b4af-458c-81e7-2838fdff1fa7-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=0.00,160.84", "text": "BANNON AND REINCE PRIEBUS, IT'S\nHIM TRYING TO BUILD A BRIDGE NOT ONLY WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT WITH\nREINCE PRIEBUS AND STEVE BANNON, WHICH IS OUTRAGING A LOT OF\nPEOPLE, NOT ONLY LIBERALS, BUT SOME TRUMPERS, SOME REPUBLICANS\nARE SAYING, WHAT ARE YOU DOING BRINGING A STEVE BANNON INTO THE\nWHITE HOUSE?

STEVE BANNON DESERVES THE PRAISE\nOF THESE FOLKS, NOT THEIR CONDEMNATION.\n>> I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN TALK ABOUT DECLINE ON CLINTON'S\nBEHALF. WHEN IN REALITY\nONE OF THE FIRST THINGS TRUMP DID WAS TWEETS OUT SOMETHING\nTHAT WAS FALSE ABOUT THE NEW YORK TIMES.\nWASN'T TRUE. MADE UP NUMBERS ABOUT\nCIRCULATION. DONALD TRUMP LIED ABOUT THE \"NEW\nYORK TIMES\". IF WE'RE GOING TO PLAY LET'S BE\nFACT CHECKERS, TELL BOTH SIDES OF THE STORY.\nWHERE'S THE BREITBART STORY HIGHLIGHTING INACCURACIES IN\nMANY THINGS DONALD TRUMP HAS SAID THAT ARE NOT TRUE.\n>> I THINK THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION.\nI THINK YOU SHOULD WRITE SOMETHING ABOUT IT.\nTHE QUESTION IS IS STEVE BANNON IS A WHITE NATIONALIST\nAND ANTI-SEMITE. I THINK WE PUT THAT QUESTION TO\nBED. >> I DON'T THINK WE PUT IT TO\nBED. JUST BECAUSE YOU SAY IT DOESN'T\nMEAN HE'S NOT. HE CERTAINLY TRAFFICS IN IT.\n>> HE MADE A BUSINESS OF IT. >> YES.\n>> HE CERTAINLY DID NOT. YOU CAN'T THROW OUT LIES LIKE\nTHAT, AND ASK ME TO PROVE A NEGATIVE, WHEN YOU CAN'T PROVE A\nPOSITIVE. I COULD SAY ANYTHING ABOUT YOU,\nDON LEMON, YOUR NETWORK HAD A COMMENTATOR\nTHE OTHER NIGHT THAT SAID THE VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP WAS A\nWHITE LASH.

THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO VERY FREELY\nAND OPENLY ATTACK ANYBODY WHO MIGHT DISAGREE WITH THEM, WHO\nATTACK THE FREE PRESS, WHO ATTACK STANDING PILLARS OF OUR\nINSTITUTION, OF OUR DEMOCRACY AND WANT TO CHANGE THAT.\nTHAT HAS A LOT OF, RIGHTFULLY SO, VERY CONCERNED.\n>> SO THIS GUY JARED TAYLOR, WHO RUNS THE SITE AMERICAN\nRENAISSANCE, A WHITE NATIONALIST SITE.\nTHIS ISN'T THE KKK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.\nTHESE ARE PEOPLE WITH ILLEGITIMATE OR LEGITIMATE\nGRIEVANCES.

SOME CAN SAY, GOOD, HE PROMISED\nIT, HE SHOULD DO IT. THAT'S A TOUGH SPOT FOR TRUMP,\nRIGHT. BECAUSE HE DID TALK THIS TALK.\nWHAT DO YOU SEE IN THIS? WHY SHOULD THAT BE A CONCERN FOR\nPEOPLE? >> ONE, TRUMP SET HIMSELF UP TO\nBE HELD TO A STANDARD HE SET DURING THE CAMPAIGN.\nIT'S GOING TO BE HIS WORDS AND HIS RHETORIC HE'S MEASURED BY,\nBY HIS OWN SUPPORTERS, BY THE MOST PASSIONATE ALT-RIGHT\nSUPPORT HE HAS. I THINK STEVE IS THERE TO ENSURE\nHE DOESN'T WAFFLE ON THESE THINGS.\nTHERE'S A DIFFERENCE IN SAYING SOMETHING IN THE BEGINNING,\nDELAYING A LITTLE BIT, AND TRYING TO GARNER SOME GOOD FAVOR\nWITH EVERYBODY ELSE BEFORE PURSUING THE AGENDA HE TALKED\nABOUT FOR SO LONG. I THINK HE'S GOING TO ULTIMATELY\nTRY TO DO THOSE THINGS. I THINK RIGHT NOW THIS IS ALL\nJUST POSTURING. >> DO YOU BELIEF THAT STEVE\nBANNON WOULD BE A FORCE TO OPPOSE THE RESPECTEDI RESPECTS\nFOR MINORITIES LIKE THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY?\n>> ABSOLUTELY. LOOK AT HOW ON THE PAGES OF\nBREITBART THEY TALK ABOUT THESE COMMUNITIES AND MINORITIES AND\nRELATIONS AND WOMEN AND THE ROLE OF WOMEN IN THIS COUNTRY.\nTHAT'S KIND OF A PLAYBOOK AT LEAST FOR THE TYPE OF RHETORIC\nTHAT THEY'RE COMFORTABLE WITH.

AND THAT HOW HE STAFFS, THE\nFIRST STEPS HE TAKES, THE FIRST IMPRESSIONS HE MAKES, THE RESET\nTHAT CAN HAPPEN AFTER AN ELECTION, ALL THOSE THINGS ARE\nIMPORTANT AND SHOULD BE THOUGHT ABOUT.\nTHE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN. DONALD TRUMP WILL BE THE NEXT\nPRESIDENT, THE 45th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nAND IT WILL BE UP TO HIM TO SET UP A TEAM THAT HE THINKS WILL\nSERVE HIM WELL AND REFLECT HIS POLICIES.\n>> SO, MARK, THESE TWO CHOICES, OBVIOUSLY, BIG NEWS AND HAVE\nBEEN DOMINATING CONVERSATION EVER SINCE THEY WERE UNVEILED\nYESTERDAY. REINCE PRIEBUS, STEVE BANNON,\nTALK ABOUT THE LOGIC OF THOSE -- OF THAT JOINT SELECTION.\n>> WELL, FROM TRUMP'S POINT OF VIEW, IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS.\nTHESE ARE TWO GUYS WHO PLAYED AS BIG A ROLE AS ANYONE ELSE IN\nGETTING HIM ELECTED. TWO GUYS WHO ARE LOYAL TO HIM,\nWHO HE FEELS LOYALTY TO, WHO HE THINKS WILL PRODUCE THE KIND OF\nWHITE HOUSE HE WANTS. AND THE REALITY IS, IF YOU TAKE\nTHE TWO OF THEM AND MIKE PENCE, TAKE AWAY THE CONTROVERSY OF\nBANNON FOR A MOMENT, IT'S NOT A BAD SETUP.\nYOU'VE GOT THREE GUYS WHO AT THE DIVISION OF LABOR TO GET STUFF\nDONE WHO TRUMP TRUSTS. AND PRIEBUS IS TRUSTED ON\nCAPITOL HILL. I THINK BANNON SHOULD SPEAK --\nTRUMP SHOULD SPEAK ABOUT HIM. BY NOT ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES\nHEAD-ON, THEY'RE ALLOWING HIM TO BE DEFINED IN A NEGAVE WAY,\nAND RIGHTFULLY SO. HE'S GOT A FULLER RESUME THAN\nJUST HIS TIME AT BREITBART. BUT PEOPLE ARE ALARMED BY HIS\nASSOCIATION WITH BREITBART. THEY'RE DOING NOTHING TO REALLY\nADDRESS IT, EXCEPT SAYING BANNON'S A GREAT GUY.\nAND I THINK THEY'RE CREATING A PROBLEM THAT THEY SHOULD ADDRESS\nHEAD-ON. IF BANNON IS GOING TO BE A\nSENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, HE NEEDS TO BE ACCOUNTABLE, AND\nTRUMP NEEDS TO EXPLAIN WHY HE'S WILLING TO OVERLOOK, WHICH HE\nAPPARENTLY IS, SOME OF THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL ASPECTS OF WHAT\nBREITBART HAS DONE. >> WELL, NOT CLEARLY HE'S\nOVERLOOKING THEM, MORE THAT HE MAY WANT TO GRACE SOME OF THE\nMORE CONTROVERSIAL ASPECTS OF WHAT BREITBART HAS DONE.\nTHE ARGUMENT TODAY COMING OUT OF SOME REPUBLICANS WHICH IS, WELL,\nYOU SEE THESE INCENDIARY HEADLINES AT BREITBART.\nYOU CAN'T HOLD STEVE BANNON ACCOUNTABLE FOR EVERY HEADLINE\nTHAT'S BEEN ON BREITBART, YEAH, YOU CAN.\nYOU REALLY CAN.

BY NOT ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES\nHEAD-ON, THEY'RE ALLOWING HIM TO BE DEFINED IN A NEGAVE WAY,\nAND RIGHTFULLY SO. HE'S GOT A FULLER RESUME THAN\nJUST HIS TIME AT BREITBART. BUT PEOPLE ARE ALARMED BY HIS\nASSOCIATION WITH BREITBART. THEY'RE DOING NOTHING TO REALLY\nADDRESS IT, EXCEPT SAYING BANNON'S A GREAT GUY.\nAND I THINK THEY'RE CREATING A PROBLEM THAT THEY SHOULD ADDRESS\nHEAD-ON. IF BANNON IS GOING TO BE A\nSENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, HE NEEDS TO BE ACCOUNTABLE, AND\nTRUMP NEEDS TO EXPLAIN WHY HE'S WILLING TO OVERLOOK, WHICH HE\nAPPARENTLY IS, SOME OF THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL ASPECTS OF WHAT\nBREITBART HAS DONE. >> WELL, NOT CLEARLY HE'S\nOVERLOOKING THEM, MORE THAT HE MAY WANT TO GRACE SOME OF THE\nMORE CONTROVERSIAL ASPECTS OF WHAT BREITBART HAS DONE.\nTHE ARGUMENT TODAY COMING OUT OF SOME REPUBLICANS WHICH IS, WELL,\nYOU SEE THESE INCENDIARY HEADLINES AT BREITBART.\nYOU CAN'T HOLD STEVE BANNON ACCOUNTABLE FOR EVERY HEADLINE\nTHAT'S BEEN ON BREITBART, YEAH, YOU CAN.\nYOU REALLY CAN.

AND HE CALLED IT THE CULTURAL\nAND POLITICAL ELITE DISMISSED DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTERS AS HE\nWOULD SAY PITCH-FORK CARRYING PEZZANTS.\nSO THEY HAVE A REAL MIND MELT THERE, AND THAT MORE THAN\nANYTHING ELSE WILL BE STEVE BANNON'S ROLE TO BE THE\nANTIESTABLISHMENT FORCE WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION.\nNOW, THIS IS NOT GOOD NEWS, NECESSARILY, FOR PAUL RYAN.\nHALLE WAS TALKING EARLIER ABOUT PEOPLE ON CAPITOL HILL THAT KNOW\nSTEVE AND THEY KNOW STEVE BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN ONE OF THE\nMAJOR AN TAG NORTHWEST TRYING TO DRIVE HIM.\nI WOULD LOOK IN THE MONTHS AHEAD FOR TENSION BETWEEN RYAN AND THE\nWHITE HOUSE. >> SO NOT A WHITE NATIONALIST\nBUT AN ECONOMIC NATIONALIST. >> I THINK STEVE DOESN'T SEE\nTHINGS -- HOW HE EXPLAINED THEM TO ME WHEN I SPOKE TO HIM, HE\nDOESN'T SEE THINGS IN TERMS OF RACE, BUT IN TERMS OF CLASS AND\nIN TERMS OF OPPORTUNITY, AND I BELIEVE THAT IF YOU LOOK AT HIS\nRECORD AND THE \"WASHINGTON POST\" REPORTED SOMETHING TODAY SO I AM\nNOT GOING OUT ON A LIMB HERE, AND HE DOESN'T TALK ABOUT RACE\nAND I DON'T SEE ANYTHING IN HIS PUBLIC STATEMENTS THAT HAVE COME\nOUT, AND BREITBART REALLY PUBLISHED OFFENSIVE STUFF AND\nTHAT'S GIVING PEOPLE JUSTIFIABLE REON FOR CONCERN, BUT AS FAR\nAS WHAT STEVE BELIEVES, YOU KNOW, I HAVE NEVER REALLY HEARD\nHIM TALK ABOUT RACE. >> THANK YOU.\n>> AND YESTERDAY, JOHN SAID HE WAS FRIENDS WITH BREITBART AND\nBANNON WAS FRIENDS WITH BREITBART, AND HE SAID YOU CAN\nJUDGE HIM ON THAT PERSONALLY IF YOU WANT TO JUDGE HIM\nPERSONALLY, HE KNOWS BREITBART WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN FRIENDS, AS\nA JEWISH GUY WOULD NOT BE FRIENDS WITH A GUY WHO IS\nANTI-SEMITIC. >> JEREMY, THANK YOU.\n>> BASICALLY IT'S WHAT YOU ARE", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1479217092011.1479213251522.4e4f25c0-199d-4f7c-8687-f7a746e64218.segment2.thumb.jpg", "channel": "356"}, {"start": 142270, "length": 19152.0, "end": 161422, "date": 1479239018748, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1479242410373.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1479239004116-b48bb189-26c4-4584-96bc-f8a10da62af9-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=142.27,161.42", "text": "PULSE.MSNBC.COM.\n>>> THE BACKLASH AGAINST STEVE BANNON AS WHITE HOUSE CHIEF\nSTRATEGIST.

AND THE DEMOCRATS HAVE A RIGHT\nTO CRITICIZE WHOEVER HE PICKS. THIS SEEMS LIKE THIS IS A\nUNIFYING FACTOR FOR THE DEMOCRATS AT A TIME WHEN THEY DO\nNEED UNITY. ASIDE FROM ALL THE CRITICISM,\nTHIS IS A MAN WHO WAS A U.S. NAVY OFFICER, A GRADUATE WITH AN\nMBA FROM HARVARD, A MAN WHO MADE MONEY IN THE FILM INDUSTRY AND\nGOLDMAN SACHS.

GOOD EVENING AND WELCOME TO THE\nKELLY FILE, I'M MEGYN KELLY. THE FALLOUT CONTINUES AFTER MR.\nTRUMP ANNOUNCED THAT TWO OF THE MEN THAT HELPED GUIDE HIS\nCAMPAIGN WILL BE HIS CLOSEST CONFIDANT INSIDE THE WALLS OF\n1600 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE.

SO I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THESE\nTHINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE CRYING OUT ABOUT.\nBUT LOOK, IT'S A GOOD TEAM.

BANNON. I'VE READ A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT\nHIM. HIS DETRACTORS SAY HE PUSHES A\nRACIST, MASSAGE NIS AGENDA, BUT WHAT IS THE ACTUAL EVIDENCE OF\nTHAT? >> WELL, I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT\nTHE LITANY OF HEADLINES THAT HAVE RUN ACROSS BREITBART NEWS\nFOR THE LAST TWO YEARS, HEADLINES ABOUT WOMEN SHOULDN'T\nBE REPORTING IN TECH. WOMEN IN THE BIRTH CONTROL ISSUE\nWITH PLANNED PARENTHOOD. YOU SEE AN AGENDA FORM.\n>> BUT YOU KNOW HIS DEFENDERS WOULD SAY, HE'S NOT RESPONSIBLE\nFOR EVERY HEADLINE THAT GOES ON BREITBART AND HE DIDN'T WRITE\nTHOSE PIECES. >> WHEN YOU'RE AT THE TOP OF THE\nORDINANCES, WHAT HAPPENS BELOW THEM AND IT HAPPENS FREQUENTLY,\nYOU HAVE TWO CHOICES, ADDRESS IT AND SHOULDN'T SHOULDN'T BE DOING\nIT OR YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING AND YOU'RE SAYING THAT.\n>> HOW LONG? >> TWO YEARS.\nWHAT WAS YOUR EXPERIENCE? >> MY EXPERIENCE THERE WAS THERE\nWERE NO ISSUES AT ALL WHEN HEADLINES LIKE THAT WHEN RUN\nWHEN MEDIA INQUIRIES ASKED WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THESE THINGS.\nTHERE WAS NEVER ANY TYPE OF RETRACTION, WALKING BACK,\nCONCESSION THAT MAYBE THEY WENT TOO FAR WITH THE STUFF.\nTHEY WERE VERY HAPPY WHEN THEY GOT THAT KIND OF ATTENTION.\n>> DO YOU BELIEVE HE BELIEVES IN THOSE PRINCIPLES IF YOU WILL OR\nDO YOU BELIEVE HE IS JUST A PROROCK IS OR IT?\n>> I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH.\nI MEAN, WHEN YOU LOOK OUT HIS PLAN PUT INTO ACTION DURING THE\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN, IT'S NOT LIKE THEY RAN AWAY FROM THOSE THEMES\nWITH, THEY EMBRACED THEM. THEY PLAYED OFF OF THEM.\nIT'S BEEN A RECIPE SO FAR, EVIDENCE THAT TRUMP'S NET WHITE\nHOUSE RIGHT NOW AND STEVE IS IN THIS HIGH PROFILE CO-CHIEF OF\nSTAFF ROLE. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,\nACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN ANYTHING.\nTHE ACTIONS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES.\n>> STEVE BANNON OBVIOUSLY TRUMP CONTROL HIMSELF.\nI THINK WE'VE SEEN THAT TRUMP ANSWERS TO NO MAN OR WOMAN.\nHE CONTROLS HIS OWN APPROACH. BUT STEVE BAN DENY SORT OF CALL\nTHE POSSIBILITY OF A DONALD TRUMP AS EARLY AS 2010.\nLISTEN TO THIS, IN 2010, AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE\nFUTURE HOLDS. HE SAID IT'S GOING TO BE AN\nINSURGENT, CENTER RIGHT POPULIST MOVEMENT THAT IS -- TOUGH WORD,\nANTI-ESTABLISHMENT, AND IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAMMER THIS\nCITY, WASHINGTON, BOTH THE PROGRESSIVE LEFT AND THE\nINSTITUTIONAL REPUBLICAN PARTY. THAT WAS 2010.\n>> YEAH, RIGHT AFTER THE TEA PARTY.\n>> WE CAN SEE WHY TRUMP WAS ATTRACTED TO HIM.\n>> THEY'RE MADE FOR EACH OTHER. YOU HAVE TWO PEOPLE WHO ARE PROVOCATIVES.\nWHO HAVE THE STATUS QUO IN WASHINGTON.\nTRUMP, STEVE FOUND THE FIRST POLITICAL FIGURE TO SYMBOLIZE\nTHAT THAT HE CAN MARTIAL HIS PLATFORM AROUND AND STEVE, TRUMP\nFOUND AN AUDIENCE THAT EXISTED FOR THAT MESSAGE.\nTHEY'RE A PERFECT MATCH. >> DO YOU THINK THAT STEVE\nBANNON THAT THOSE KINDS OF COMMENTS WOULD BE PUSHED AS AN\nAGENDA? YOU KNOW, AN ANTI-WOMAN,\nANTI-MINORITY, ANTI-GAY AGENDA. TRUMP CERTAINLY -- WELL, YOU\nTELL ME. >> WELL, I THINK IT'S AN AGENDA.\nI THINK ANY TIME YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING AS FREQUENTLY AS THEY\nHAVE BEEN WITH THE AUDIENCE AND THE SIZE THAT THEY HAVE, AND THE\nPROFILE THAT THEY'VE BUILT OFF OF THAT, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU\nCAN SAY ANYTHING ELSE OTHER THAN THAT'S CLEARLY AN AGENDA.\n>> HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL IF YOU FEEL THAT WAY AND YOU\nWORK CLOSELY WITH HIM. >> THAT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY\nI LEFT. PUBLICLY BACK IN MARCH I SAID I\nCOULD NOT BE A PART OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS ANYMORE.\nAND I BELIEVE WHEN YOU CAN'T DO YOUR JOB HONESTLY AND TO THE\nBEST OF YOUR ABILITY, THAT'S WHEN IT'S TIME TO WALK AWAY.\nAND THAT'S WHY I DID. >> ARE YOU WORRIED NOW BEING ON\nTHE OPPOSITE SIDE OF BANNON? >> NO.\nI MEAN FIRST OF ALL, IF STEVE BANNON IS A CO-WHITE HOUSE CHIEF\nOF STAFF GO AFTER MY LIFE. THAT'S CONCERNING ALL TO ITSELF,\nBUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, I THINK THAT HE HAS BIGGER FISH TO\nFRY. >> KURT, GREAT TO SEE YOU.\n>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON. >> NOW NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER\nREPUBLICAN SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE. GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK.\n>> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU. >> YOU'VE HEARD THE REPORTS AND\nTHE STEVE BANNON AND I'LL SHOW THE VIEWERS THE HEADLINES.\nYOU KNOW, HE DIDN'T WRITE THESE, BUT HE WAS THE EXECUTIVE\nCHAIRMAN OF BREITBART WHENNEN SOME WENT UP.\nSHE CALLED, NOT HE, BREITBART REFERRED TO BILL CRYSTAL AS A\nRENEGADE JEW. WOMEN SHOULD LOG OFF WITH\nANOTHER ONE. HERE'S A COUPLE MORE.\nSTAND BY. BIRTH CONTROL MAKES WOMEN\nUNATTRACTIVE AND CRAZY. WOULD YOU RATHER YOUR CHILD HAD\nFEMINISM OR CANCER? AND THEN THERE WAS THESE\nCHESTNUTS, GAY RIGHTS HAVE MADE US DUMBER.\nFAT SHAMING WORKS. THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF\nHEADLINES. >> FIRST OF ALL, THERE'S A BIG\nDIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE KIND OF STUFF THEY DID AT BREITBART.\n>> QUICKLY -- >> TIGHT END,ING HIMSELF DOING\nIT. BANNON IS A VERY SERIOUS GUY.\nWE KNOW HIM WELL. HE IS VERY DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT\nWASHINGTON HAS GROWN CORRUPT. HE FEELS THOSE THINGS DEEPLY.\nHE'S ALSO AN OFFICER THAT PLAYED THAT COUNTRY PATRIOTICALLY.\nPUT HIM IN AS THE CAYLY COORDINATOR AS CHIEF OF STAFF,\nBUT THEN HE SAID LOOK, I WANT A GUY WHO'S GOING TO THINK ABOUT\nTHE FIGHTS WE'RE GOING TO BE IN AND HE'S GOING TO BE\nENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THOSE FIGHTS. AND HE GAVE -- IN SOME WAYS I\nTHINK ENDED UP GIVING BANNON THE EQUIVALENT OF THE CARL ROVE JOB\nOR THE AXELROD JOB IN PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS.\n>> THAT'S WHAT BANNON SAID, HE'S A FIGHTER.\nAND HE LIKED TO BUFF UP WASHINGTON, HE DOESN'T LIKE THE\nESTABLISHMENT. THAT'S WHAT TRUMP IS.\nA LOT OF TRUMP'S VOTERS AND SUPPORTERS WANT.\nNOW LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THE NEWS ON CAB GNAT APPOINTMENTS.\nTONIGHT, RUDY GIULIANI IS THE FAVORITE, THEY'RE SAYING THE\nFAVORITE FOR SECRETARY OF STATE. DO YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON\nTHAT? >> I HAVE NO INFORMATION, BUT IF\nRUDY WANTS IT, HE'LL GET IT. RUDY HAS BEEN THE CLOSEST\nSURROGATE, HE AND SENATOR SESSIONS HAVE BEEN THE TWO\nCLOSEST TO PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP.\nHE HAS DONE A GREAT JOB. HE HAS WORKED HIS HEART OUT.\nI THOUGHT HE MIGHT PREFER ATTORNEY GENERAL WHERE HE WOULD\nBE BRILLIANT OR HOMELAND SECURITY WHERE HIS EXPERIENCE AT\n9/11 WILL BE GREAT. I THINK HE'LL BE FABULOUS TO\nHAVE HIM AS SECRETARY OF STATE. HE'S ALREADY KNOWN WORLDWIDE.\nHE IS A GREAT MANAGER. AND HE WOULD DO A LOT BOTH TO\nREPRESENT AMERICA, WHICH IS WHAT WE NEED, AND TO REFORM THE STATE\nDEPARTMENT. WHICH WE NEED.\nI'D BE ENTHUSE YAESIC IF HE PICKS RUDY.\n>> SOME ARE SAYING JEFF SESSIONS AND LAURA INGRAM MAY BE UNDER\nCONSIDERATION FOR PRESS SECRETARY AND ANOTHER POSITION,\nSHE'S DOWN ON TUCKER CARLSON'S SHOW.\nNSA AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, MR. SPEAKER?\nARE YOU BEING CONSIDERED FOR A POSITION AND IS THERE ONE YOU\nHAVE YOUR EYE ON? >> WELL, I WANT TO BE THE\nGENERAL PLANNER LOOKING OUT OVER THE NEXT EIGHT YEARS AND TRYING\nTO DESIGN HOW WE FUNDAMENTALLY RESHAPE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.\nAND THAT'S A VERY BROAD JOB. THE CLOSEST ANALOGY PROBABLY IS\nHARRY HOPKINS AND THE WORK HE DID FOR FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT.\nFIRST ABOUT SESSIONS, SENATOR SESSIONS WAS THE MOST LOYAL, THE\nEARLIEST SUPPORTER OF TRUMP IN WASHINGTON.\nHE WOULD BE A GREAT AS ATTORNEY GENERAL BECAUSE HE SPENT 13\nYEARS IN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, AND WAS ATTORNEY GENERAL OF\nALABAMA. HE WOULD ALSO BE TREMENDOUS AT\nTHE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE. I WOULD BE VERY ENTHUSIASTIC\nWHATEVER HE AND THE PRESIDENT-ELECT DECIDE.\n>> NOW, TRUMP IS GETTING HIT TONIGHT IN SOME CORNERS BECAUSE\nHE IS ASKING FOR TOP SECRET CLEARANCE FOR HIS CHILDREN IN\nTHE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. AND THE CONFLICT HIS DETRACTORS\nSAY IS THAT HE HAS SAID HIS ADULT CHILDREN ARE RUNNING THE\nTRUMP ORGANIZATION AND IT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE OR WRONG TO\nHAVE THEM MAINTAIN THIS ACTIVE BUSINESS INTEREST WITH\nINTERNATIONAL TIES, AND BOTH HAVE ACCESS TO TOP SECRET\nINFORMATION. IS THAT -- DO THEY HAVE A POINT?\n>> LOOK, I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW HILLARY CLINTON", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1479179818259.1479175967716.38bff08c-a2c1-4ffe-847e-96c3ed1e2fe8.segment6.thumb.jpg", "channel": "360"}, {"start": 645583.0, "length": 357011.0, "end": 1002594, "date": 1479204456326, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1479207026370.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1479204442111-5f61fbad-49e9-4045-89e7-286c518762f5-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=645.58,1002.59", "text": ">>> I THOUGHT IT WAS A GREAT\nDECISION.

HE WAS A MANAGING PARTNER AT\nGOLDMAN SACHS. HE MADE A SERIES OF MOVIES.\nHAS GREAT CONNECTIONS IN HOLIDAY AND HE RAN BRIGHT\nBARTD.

THAT'S BOLOGNA.\n>> AND WE'RE BACK WITH THE PANEL.\nCHARLES, THOUGHTS? >> LOOK, I HEAR THE CHARGE\nOF THE MAN IS AN ANTI-SEMITE.\nI FIND IT RATHER IMPLAUSIBLE THAT A PRESIDENT-ELECT WOULD\nAPPOINT AS HIS SENIOR STRATEGIST AN ANTI-SEMITE\nWHEN HIS DAUGHTER IS JEWISH, HER HUSBAND IS CLOSEST\nADVISOR IS JEWISH, AND THEIR CHILDREN, HIS GRANDCHILDREN\nARE JEWISH. SO I DON'T THINK HE IS\nSENDING A SIGNAL ABOUT THAT. WHAT I THINK HE IS -- THE\nPROBLEM HERE IS THAT HE MAY BE MORE TOLERANT OF THIS\nKIND OF DEVIANCE IF YOU LIKE, LIKE STEPPING SOMEWHAT\nBEYOND THE LINES OF THE ACCEPTABLE THAN WHAT IS\nNORMAL. WILLIAM BUCKLEY WAS ABLE TO\nREVITALIZE CONSERVATISM OR, IN FACT, TO GIVE IT LIFE\nWHEN HE BANISHED THE JOHN BIRD SOCIETY.\nWHICH IS IN SOME WAY THE SORT OF AT LEAST THE ANALOG\nWAY BACK IN THE 1950S TO SOME OF THE ALT RIGHT.\nI THINK IT'S INSENSITIVE FOR TRUMP TO HAVE MADE E IS KIND\nOF APPOINTMENT WITHOUT CONSIDERING THAT BUT IN THE\nEND IT WILL DEPEND ON WHAT HE DOES.\nRIGHT NOW IT LOOKS AS IF PRIEBUS IS GOING TO BE THE\nMAN IN CHARGE. WE WILL SEE WHO IN THE END\nIS GOING TO HAVE THE YOU WERE HAND AND WE WILL ALSO\nSEE IF BANNON, WHO WILL OBVIOUSLY APPEAR ON\nTELEVISION AND OTHER PLACES SPEAKS IN A WAY THAT\nJUSTIFIES THE WAY HE IS BEING CARICATURED TONIGHT.\nI WOULD SAY WHAT OBAMA IS SAYING, GIVE HIM ROOM WITH\nHIS APPOINTMENTS AND WE WILL JUDGE THEM BY THEIR ACTIONS.\n>> CLEARLY THE PRESIDENT-ELECT IS TRYING TO\nRECREATE THE MAGIC, IF YOU WILL, OF HIS CAMPAIGN.\nTHAT ENDED UP WITH A WINNING STRATEGY AT THE END THERE,\nCAITLIN. AND, PERHAPS, PROVIDING SOME\nCOVER FOR AN ESTABLISHMENT CHOICE AS CHIEF OF STAFF.\n>> RIGHT, CONTACT EXACTLY. IS HE GOING TO GET SOME PUSH\nBACK ROGER STONE TWEETED EARLIER BEFORE THIS\nANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE THAT THERE WOULD BE BACKLASH TO\nPRIEBUS BECAUSE IS HE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE\nESTABLISHMENT. AT THE SAME TIME THESE ARE\nTWO PEOPLE THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO KIND OF BALANCE EACH\nOTHER OUT IN A WAY. THE STATEMENT THAT THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN -- THAT PRESIDENT-ELECT, THE TEAM\nRELEASED SAID THEY WOULD BE KIND OF EQUAL PARTNERS.\nAND SO THOSE WHO ARE OPPOSED TO BANNON, I THINK WILL LOOK\nFOR A PARTNER IN PRIEBUS. AND THOSE WHO THINK THAT\nPRIEBUS IS REPRESENTATIVE OF EVERYTHING WRONG IN\nWASHINGTON WILL LOOK TO BANNON.\nI DO THINK THOUGH THAT IT -- THAT BANNON HISTORY, THAT\nWHAT HIS SITE PUBLISHED UNDER HIS TENURE IS\nTROUBLING TO DEMOCRATS BUT ALSO REPUBLICANS.\nAND PARTICULARLY SINCE BANNON HAD GONE SO PUBLICLY\nAFTER PAUL RYAN. I THINK PAUL RYAN WILL SEEK\nTHAT PARTNERSHIP IN PRIEBUS. THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT\nREPUBLICANS STILL ABOUT THAT CHOICE AS WELL.\n>> CHARLES? >> I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE\nMOST INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT THIS ELECTION HAS BEEN\nWHAT HAS HAPPENED TO POLITICAL LANGUAGE.\nAND OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF WHAT WE HAVE HEARD IN THE PAST 18\nMONTHS HAS BEEN SHOCKING.

TO MOLLY'S POINT, CLEARLY\nCOUNTING ON A VICTORY. THEY ARE GOING THROUGH A SOUL\nSEARCHING PROCESS NOW.

HOW MUCH OF THE PARTY LAST EIGHT\nYEARS WAS SIMPLY UNIQUE TO BARACK OBAMA AND HOW MUCH IS\nDEVELOPING IN WHAT IT CAN BE BEYOND JUST ONE PERSON FOR THE\nFUTURE? >> AND WHO WILL BE THE LEADER\nNOW? THERE ISN'T, AFTER OBAMA LEAVES,\nTHERE ISN'T A LEADER OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.\nIS IT GOING TO BE ELIZABETH WARREN, BERNIE SANDERS, BOTH\nMAKING A PLAY. OR KEITH ELLISON, THE DEMOCRATIC\nCONGRESSMAN FROM MINNESOTA? REALLY IS THAT IS UP FOR GRABS\nNOW. ONE THING YOU'RE HEARING ON ONE\nSILVER LINING, I GUESS, YOU'RE HEARING FROM DEMOCRATS, TRUMP'S\nPROMISE ON TRANSPORTATION. SAYING THEY CAN WORK WITH HIM.\nSO WE'LL SEE HOW THAT PLAYS OUT. >> YET YOU HAVE REPUBLICANS\nVOWING TO WORK AGAINST HIM.

IT SEEMS FROM MY AREA, THE\nMIDDLE EAST, HE HAS A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE ISSUES AT\nHAND AND HE'S VERY MUCH IN LINE WITH PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP IN\nTERMS OF HOW HE SEES HOW WE CAN IMPROVE THE ATROCIOUS SITUATION\nWE HAVE IN THE MIDDLE EAST RIGHT NOW.\nWHAT ABOUT RETIRED LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR MICHAEL FLYNN, FORMER\nHEAD OF THE DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE AGENCY WHO'S WIDELY BEEN\nSPECULATED TO BECOME THE PRESIDENT'S NATIONAL SECURITY\nADVISOR. >> WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF\nGENERALS IN THE PAST.

WE SEE PEOPLE LOSE THEIR JOBS OR\nNEW PEOPLE COME IN AND THESE JOBS CAN CHANGE.\nBUT IT'S THE FIRST SIGNIFICANT INDICATION WE GET ABOUT HOW\nDONALD TRUMP PLANS TO GOVERNOR SO WHEN WE LOOK AT HIS NATIONAL\nSECURITY PICKS, YOU HEARD RAND PAUL PUSHING BACK AGAINST JOHN\nBOLTON BECAUSE IT GIVES HIM A CLUE ABOUT HOW THINGS MAY\nPROCEED IN A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SO THAT'S WHAT WE\nASSESS AND WHY THESE INITIAL PICKS ARE SO IMPORTANT.\n>> AND PARTICULARLY FOR A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE THIS IS\nSOMEONE THAT DOESN'T HAVE A RECORD AS A POLITICIAN OR\nMILITARY LEADER GOING BACK LIKE WE'VE SEEN WITH PRESIDENTS\nBEFORE HIM. SO THIS WILL GIVE US AN\nINDICATION OF WHERE HE PLANS TO GO BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHERE\nHE'S BEEN. >> IT WAS INTERESTING TO HEAR\nSENATOR RAND PAUL SAY TO THE PRESIDENT -- HE WAS TALKING TO\nUS, TALKING TO THE WORLD BUT HE WAS ALSO TALKING THE\nPRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP WHO SAYS \"PICK SOMEONE WHO THINKS THE\nIRAQ WAR WAS A DISASTER, PICK ONE SLYKE YOU WHO THINKS\nREMOVING QADDAFI WAS A DISASTER, PICK ONE LIKE YOU WHO THINKS THE\nREGIME CHANGE HAS BEEN A DISASTER.\nTHAT WAS A STRONG MESSAGE HE WAS SENDING TO THE PRESIDENT-ELECT.\n>> VERY UNAMBIGUOUS. TRUMP HAS NO RECORD IN OFFICE\nTHAT GIVES US A SENSE OF HIS INCLINATION, HE'S SAID SO MANY\nCONFLICTING THINGS ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\nHE DIDN'T FORMULATE A BIG SHEAF OF FOREIGN POLICY WHITE PAPERS\nON HIS WEB SITE. HE'D SAY ONE THING ON THE STUMP\nAND SAY THE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE THING AT THE SAME TIME WHICH\nENABLED PEOPLE TO HEAR WHATEVER THEY WANTED TO OUT OF HIS\nRHETORIC SO PEOPLE LIKE RAND PAUL HEARD TRUMP TALK AND SAY,\nOKAY, HE'S A NON-INTERVENTIONIST LIKE ME.\nOTHER PEOPLE HEARD HIM SAY \"WE'RE GOING TO BOMB THE YOU\nKNOW WHAT OUT OF ISIS\" AND THEY THINK OKAY, HE'S LIKE JOHN\nBOLTON, HE WANTS MASSIVE MILITARY MIGHT.\nAS DAVID WAS SAYING, THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FIRST SIGNAL\nWE'LL GET ABOUT WHAT -- WHEN THE RUBBER HITS THE ROAD WHEN TRUMP\nHAS TO MAKE POLICY AND CAN'T SAY WHAT EVERYBODY WANTS TO HEAR\nWHAT IS THE DIRECTION HE WANTS TO GO?\n>> GENERAL KIMMITT, ALMOST EVERY SPEECH, ALMOST EVERY RALLY WE\nHEARD FROM TRUMP HE RAILED AGAINST THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL,\nSAYING IT WAS A DISASTER, BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN CASH\nFLOWING TO IRAN. NOW THAT HE'LL BE THE PRESIDENT\nOF THE UNITED STATES, CAN HE UNILATERALLY ELIMINATE IT,\nREMOVE IT, SAY IT'S OVER? >> FIRST OF ALL, I THINK WHAT\nHE'S BEEN SAYING RECENTLY IS THAT HE IS GOING TO ABIDE BY IT\nBUT HE'S GOING TO MAKE SURE IT'S ENFORCED.\nAS RECENTLY AS TODAY THE IRANIANS HAVE VIOLATED THE TERMS\nOF THE AGREEMENT BY OVERPRODUCING THEIR HEAVY WATER.\nI DON'T THINK THAT A PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOING TO SIT BACK AND\nALLOW THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT TO BE VIOLATED, TO DRAW A RED\nLINE THAT WON'T BE CROSSED. WHAT YOU'LL SEE AS A PRESIDENT\nIN THE MIDDLE EAST THAT WILL SHOW RESOLVE, CONSISTENCY AND\nTACK BACK TO THE TRADITIONAL ALLIES THAT YOU HAVE.\n>> IT'S INTERESTING HE DID HAVE A PHONE CALL, DAVID, WITH PUTIN\nYESTERDAY AND APPARENTLY IT WAS A PRETTY SMOOTH CALL.\n>> AND IT WAS A CLEAR ELBOW TO THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AS WELL\nIN THE READOUT OF THAT CALL THAT THEY BOTH COMMITTED TO BETTER\nRELATIONS, ADMITTING RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES ARE\nOFF COURSE. >> WE HAVE BREAKING NEWS COMING\nIN FROM CAPITOL HILL RIGHT NOW. LET'S GO TO MANU RAJU.\nMANU, CAN YOU HEAR ME? WE UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE THE FINAL\nWORD ON THE FUTURE OF THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE.\n>> THAT'S RIGHT. PAUL RYAN WILL BE THE NEXT\nSPEAKER OF THE HOUSE. THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE\nJUST NOMINATED PAUL RYAN IN A UNANIMOUS VOICE VOTE.\nWE ARE TOLD BY SOURCES IN THE ROOM WHO SAID HE WAS\nOVERWHELMINGLY SUPPORTED BY HIS REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE.\nTHIS IS ONE STEP FOR HIM TO BE REELECTED SPEAKER, THIS IS THE\nNOMINATION VOTE, SO EACH SIDE PUTS UP ITS NOMINEE FOR SPEAKER\nAND REPUBLICANS, SINCE THEY WILL BE IN THE HOUSE -- IN THE\nMAJORITY AND THE NEW CONGRESS IT MEANS THAT RYAN WILL BE THE\nSPEAKER OF THE HOUSE. THIS WAS THE NOMINATION VOTE IN\nJANUARY, IT WILL BE THE FULL VOTE IN THE HOUSE OF\nREPRESENTATIVES. NOW THAT VOTE ON THE FLOOR, PAUL\nRYAN CAN LOSE NO MORE THAN 20 VOTES OR SO, WOLF.\nRIGHT NOW REPUBLICANS ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE 238 VOTES ON\nTHE FLOOR IN THE CHAMBER NEXT CONGRESS AT LEAST.\nTHEY MAY HAVE A FEW MORE BECAUSE SOME RACES ARE OUTSTANDING.\nHE CAN'T LOSE MORE THAN 20 VOTES ON THE HOUSE FLOOR AND THAT'S\nNOT GOING TO HAPPEN I'M TOLD IT'S A UNIFIED CONFERENCE EVEN\nTHOUGH THERE WAS SOME DISSENSION BUT HE WAS NOMINATED BY ONE\nMEMBER OF THE HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS TODAY THAT ISS IMICK\nMULVANEY AS WELL AS CHRIS COLLINS, A LONG-TIME TRUMP\nSUPPORTER AND PAUL RYAN'S POSITION OVER DONALD TRUMP\nCAUSED CONSTERNATION AMONG TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS BUT RYAN HAS\nMOVED TO ALLEVIATE THOSE CONCERNS, HE'S EMBRACED TRUMP\nSAR TIGHTLY IN THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS, HE'S WORKING WITH THEM\nCLOSELY AS WELL DURING THIS TRANSITION PERIOD AFTER THE BIG\nWIN WHEN THEY KEPT CONTROL OF THE HOUSE AND SENATE MAJORITY.\nWINNING BACK THE WHITE HOUSE. WANTING TO HIT THE GROUND\nRUNNING IN A NEW ADMINISTRATION. PAUL RYAN NOT FACING PUSH BACK.\nA MUCH DIFFERENT FEELING HERE THAN IT WAS A MONTH AGO WHEN I\nLOOKED LIKE PAUL RYAN COULD FACE CHALLENGE FROM THE RIGHT.\nWE ARE HEARING THIS VOTE HAS CONCLUDED, PAUL RYAN CHOSEN BY\nHIS COLLEAGUES TO BE THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE BY A VOICE VOTE\nSUGGESTING NOT A LOT OF DISSENSION AMONG HIS COLLEAGUES.\n>> SOUNDS UNANIMOUS, WE HAVE A TWEET THAT PAUL RYAN JUST\nRELEASED. THERE YOU SEE IT RIGHT THERE.\n\"IT'S A TREMENDOUS HONOR TO BE NOMINATED BY MY COLLEAGUES TO\nSERVE AS SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE. NOW IT'S TIME TO GO BIG.\"\nDAVID CHALIAN, WHEN HE SAYS \"GO BIG\" WHAT DOES THAT MEAN DAY\nONE, DAY TWO, DAY THREE WITH THE NEW PRESIDENT.\n>> I'M SURPRISED HE DIDN'T SAY GO BIGLEY AND USE THE TRUMP TERM\nBECAUSE IT'S LARGELY DUE TO DONALD TRUMP'S ELECTION AS\nPRESIDENT THAT PAUL RYAN WAS ABLE TO BE NOMINATED BY HIS\nCONFERENCE. DONALD TRUMP'S ELECTION GAVE\nPAUL RYAN BREATHING ROOM NOT ONLY TO PUT TOGETHER WHAT HE\nNEEDED TO DO IN THE CONFERENCE TO HAVE THIS NOMINATION BUT TO\nGIVE HIMSELF SOME RUNNING ROOM WITH THE START OF THE NEW\nCONGRESS. IF THE ELECTION HAD GONE THE\nOTHER WAY, I THINK THE REPUBLICANS WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH\nMORE DIVISIVE. >> HE WANTED TO SAY BIG LEAGUE\nBUT HE'S LIMITED TO 140 CHARACTERS.\nWHAT'S YOUR REACTION WHEN YOU HEAR THE UNANIMITY AMONG\nREPUBLICANS. >> I AGREE WITH DAVID.\nTRUMP'S ELECTION. THERE WERE A FEW PEOPLE IN THERE\nWHO THOUGHT RYAN SEPARATING HIMSELF HURT HIS CHANCES.\nNOW THAT THAT'S NOT AN ISSUE, PAUL RYAN IS THE PERSON THEY\nWANT TO SEE GO FORWARD. NO ONE CAN MAKE A CASE BECAUSE\nHE KEPT THAT HOUSE THAT HE SHOULDN'T BE.\nSO BLESSING AND A CURSE. >> WINNING CONCENTRATES THE\nMIND. ALL OF THESE FREEDOM CAUCUS\nMEMBERS WHO WERE SO TROUBLESOME WHEN THEY WERE IN THE MINORITY,\nALL OF A SUDDEN THEY'RE ON BOARD.\nHOWEVER WHAT'S REALLY GOING TO BE THE ISSUE IS WHEN THERE IS\nPOLICY TO BE PASSED. YOU HAVE A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS\nWHOSE AGENDA MAY BE AT ODDS WITH A PRESIDENT TRUMP AND\nREPUBLICANS THINK THEY CAN ROLL TRUMP.\nTHEY THINK BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE SYSTEM THEY CAN CALL THE SHOTS,\nWE SHALL SEE WHO'S IN CHARGE. >> AND WHAT'S INTERESTING IS\nREPUBLICANS MOVED QUICKLY ON THEIR LEADERSHIP FRONT.\nDEMOCRATS NOT SO QUICKLY. THANKS VERY MUCH.\nTHAT'S IT FOR ME. SEE YOU BACK HERE 5:00 P.M. EAST\nAMERICAN THE SITUATION ROOM.

MIKE?\n>> Reporter: HI, JENNA, GOOD AFTERNOON TO YOU.\nA MUCH DIFFERENT HOUSE REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE AFTER THE\n2016 ELECTION. OF COURSE, DURING THE\nPRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, THERE WERE PLENTY OF TIMES WHEN PAUL\nRYAN AND DONALD TRUMP DID NOT SEE EYE TO EYE, AND SOME WERE\nCALLING FOR A NEW HOUSE SPEAKER, BUT NOW THAT MR. TRUMP HAS BEEN\nELECTED SOME OF THE GOP FRUSTRATION AFTER EIGHT YEARS OF\nA DEMOCRAT IN THE WHITE HOUSE HAS LIFTED.\nALREADY SPEAKER RYAN IS TALKING ABOUT WORKING WITH THE\nPRESIDENT-ELECT AND HIS TRANSITION TEAM TO LAY OUT AN\nAMBITIOUS PATH FOR 2017, AND RYAN SAYS HE WANTS TO HIT THE\nGROUND RUNNING IN JANUARY TO DELIVER ON THE NEW PRESIDENT'S\nAGENDA. >> I'M NOT LOOKING BACKWARDS.\nI'M LOOKING FORWARD. I'M LOOKING TO THE FORWARD, AND\nI'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HOW WE MAKE THIS WORK FOR THE AMERICAN\nPEOPLE, HOW WE HELP PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP BE THE\nMOST SUCCESSFUL PRESIDENT IN OUR LIFETIMES, HOW WE MAKE GOOD ON\nTHE PROMISES AND GET THIS COUNTRY GOING AGAIN.\n>> SO WE'RE NOT EXPECTING DRAMA ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE.\nON THE DEMOCRAT SIDE THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE LEADERSHIP\nELECTIONS ON THURSDAY. THAT HAS NOW BEEN BUMPED BACK\nALMOST TWO WEEKS TO NOVEMBER 30th.\nTIME FOR SOME SOUL SEARCHING. >> I MEAN, IF THERE WASN'T\nCONSTERNATION ABOUT THIS. >> WE JUST GOT A SHELLACKING\nTUESDAY. GOT AN UNEXPECTED DEFEAT AND\nWE'VE GOT TO RECALIBRATE AND DECIDE HOW TO GO FORWARD.\n>> Reporter: NOT SURPRISING, THE PARTY THAT WON THE ELECTION IS\nJOYOUS AND EXCITED TO GET TO WORK.\nTHE PARTY THAT LOST IS THINKING PERHAPS IT MAY BE TIME FOR SOME\nNEW LEADERSHIP, BUT WE WILL SEE IF THEY HAVE THE VOTES.\nJENNA? >> WE WILL.\nSOMETHING WE'RE WATCHING. MIKE, THANK YOU.\n>> MEANTIME, PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP IS MEETING TODAY WITH HIS\nFUTURE VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE TO GO OVER CABINET PICKS FOR THE\nNEW ADMINISTRATION. WE'RE HEARING OF A VARIETY OF\nPOSSIBLE NAMES OF WHO COULD FILL THE TRUMP POSTS.\nWHO COULD BE IN OR OUT, BLAKE BERMAN LIVE IN WASHINGTON WITH\nSOME OF THOSE DETAILS. HI, BLAKE.\n>> Reporter: HI THERE, ERIC. GOOD AFTERNOON TO YOU.\nRIGHT NOW THE PRESIDENT-ELECT IS AT TRUMP TOWER AT\nPRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP BEGINS TO PUT TOGETHER HIS CABINET AND\nSOME HINTS AS TO JUST WHAT THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE ARE APPEARING\nTHROUGH THE PROCESS OF ELIMINATION.\nA BIG NAME COMING OFF THE BOARD EARLIER TODAY, THAT BEING\nDR. BEN CARSON. FOX IS NOW TOLD THAT CARSON HAS\nREMOVED HIMSELF FROM A ROLE IN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, HEALTH\nAND HUMAN SERVICES AND EDUCATION WERE SEEN THERE AS\nPOSSIBILITIES. LAST NIGHT HERE IN WASHINGTON\nRUDY GIULIANI ALSO SAID THAT HE WOULD NOT BE THE NEXT ATTORNEY\nGENERAL, BUT FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR'S NAME IS NOW BEING\nCONNECTED TO THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING THE NEXT SECRETARY OF\nSTATE. TAKE A LISTEN TO CAMPAIGN\nMANAGER KELLYANNE CONWAY SPEAKING EARLIER THIS MORNING\nABOUT GIULIANI ON \"FOX & FRIENDS.\"\n>> HIS NAME HAS CERTAINLY BEEN MENTIONED IN A SERIOUS WAY IN\nCONNECTION WITH SECRETARY OF STATE, A JOB THAT HE'S QUALIFIED\nFOR AND A JOB THAT HE WOULD DO EXCEEDINGLY WELL.\nHE HAS ONE OF EIGHT, TEN ADVISERS THAT WERE VERY CLOSE TO\nDONALD TRUMP THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN.\n>> Reporter: AND THEN THERE'S THIS TODAY FROM THE FAMED\nINVESTOR CARL ICAHN. HE ADDED A COUPLE MORE NAMES TO\nTHE MIX. HERE'S WHAT HE TWEETED OUT\nEARLIER THIS MORNING, QUOTE, SPOKE TO DONALD TRUMP.\nSTEVE MNUCHIN AND WILBUR ROSS ARE BEING CONSIDERED FOR\nTREASURY AND COMMERCE. BOTH WOULD BE GREAT CHOICES.\nTHAT FROM ICAHN. MNUCHIN, AS YOU KNOW, WAS THE\nFINANCE CHAIR FOR DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN AND ROSS IS A FAMED\nBILLIONAIRE INVESTOR. ERIC, BACK TO YOU.\n>> ALL RIGHT, BLAKE. SHOULD PROBABLY GET THOSE NAMES\nHOPEFULLY IN AN ANNOUNCEMENT PRETTY SOON.\nTHANKS. JENNA?\n>> IT WAS SURREAL, BUT IT WAS ALSO ONE OF THESE THINGS WHERE A\nHUGE BURDEN IS PUT ON YOUR SHOULDERS, AND THAT WAS THE\nINSTANT FEELING, BUT I WANT TO DO HIM PROUD, BUT MOST\nIMPORTANTLY HE WANTS TO DO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE PROUD.\nHE WANTS TO DO THE THINGS THAT HE SAID, AND IT'S REALLY\nIMPORTANT FOR HIM RIGHT NOW. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW THE \"60\nMINUTES\" INTERVIEW LAST NIGHT. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT ALL\nAMERICANS UNDERSTAND THAT HE IS A PRESIDENT FOR EVERYONE.\nHE WANTS TO MAKE EVERYONE PROUD, WHATEVER YOUR RACE, ETHNIC\nBACKGROUND, GENDER, ANYTHING. >> RNC CHAIRMAN REINCE PRIEBUS\nDESCRIBING HIS REACTION WHEN DONALD TRUMP ASKED HIM TO SERVE\nOF AS WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF, THE FIRST OF THOUSANDS OF\nJOBS. MR. TRUMP'S TRANSITION TEAM HAS\nTO FILL. THE HOOVER INSTITUTION RESEARCH\nFELLOW AND COLUMNIST FOR THE CENTO B AND THINK IT'S A SMART\nHIRE. BILL, WHY DO YOU THINK THAT?\n>> I DO. WELL, REINCE IS SHORT FOR\nREINHOLD AND THAT TRANSLATES TO WISE COUNSEL.\nTHAT'S WHAT HE IS. REINCE PRIEBUS IS ONLY 44 YEARS,\nA PUP BY WASHINGTON STANDARDS AND FIGHTING BATTLES IN\nWISCONSIN FOR YEARS. HE'S VERY GOOD AT HOLDING HANDS,\nSOOTHING EGOS AND PUTTING IN A STRATEGY WHICH WE SAW COME INTO\nEFFECT LAST TUESDAY, SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A WHITE HOUSE\nCHIEF OF STAFF WHO IS REALLY GOOD AT MANAGEMENT AND WISE\nCOUNSEL, THIS IS THE GUY YOU WANT.\n>> INTERESTING PERSPECTIVE. IT'S FUNNY YOU MENTION HIS AGE.\nSOMETHING I WAS THINKING ABOUT AS WE WERE PREPARING FOR OUR\nSEGMENT WITH YOU, BILL, IS THAT, YOU KNOW, PAUL RYAN, REINCE\nPRIEBUS, THESE ARE YOUNG GUYS IN THEIR 40s.\nDONALD TRUMP WILL BE THE OLDEST PERSON THAT WILL BE PRESIDENT OF\nTHE UNITED STATES. NO HIT ON HIM.\nJUST A FACT. I KNOW HE HAS A LOT OF STAMINA.\nWE'VE HEARD WITH THAT, BUT IT'S INTERESTING TO THINK ABOUT THE\nFUTURE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WITH SUCH YOUNG MEN THAT ARE IN\n POSITIONS, AND WE BELIEVE THAT PAUL RYAN WILL\nMAINTAIN HIS. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?\n>> RIGHT. WELL, IT'S FUNNY, SO A FEW YEARS\nAGO WE HAD A PHRASE IN WASHINGTON CALLED YOUNG GUNS,\nAND THIS WAS PAUL RYAN AND KEVIN McCARTHY AND ERIC CANTOR WHO AT\nTHE TIME WAS THE HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER AND THEY TALKED ABOUT\nBRINGING A YOUNGER STYLE OF REPUBLICAN POLITICS FORWARD, AND\nTHAT'S SOMETHING TO WATCH FOR FROM PRIEBUS.\nBEFORE WE GET TOO FAR AHEAD OF OURSELVES, WE DON'T KNOW YET\nWHAT HIS RESPONSIBILITIES ARE BEYOND THE TRADITIONAL CHIEF OF\nSTAFF FUNCTION, MANAGEMENT, TIME KEEPING AND GATE KEEPING TO THE\nOVAL OFFICE. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'LL HAVE TO\nSAY IN POLICY BUT HE'LL BE THE VOICE PUSHING DONALD TRUMP IN A\nDIRECTION THAT SOME REPUBLICANS WANT TO SEE IN TERMS OF A\nBROADER TENT. >> YOU CAN SAY NEWT GINGRICH IS\nNOT NECESSARILY IN THE SAME CORNER, BUT SOMEBODY WHOSE NAME\nIS BROUGHT UP AS A THINKER FOR CONSERVATIVES.\n>> RIGHT. >> AND HE HAD SOME THOUGHTS ON\nREINCE PRIEBUS BECOMING THE ADVISER TO THE COMMANDER IN\nCHIEF, AND HERE'S WHAT NEWT GINGRICH HAD TO SAY.\n>> I THINK THAT REINCE HAS THE RIGHT PERSONALITY FOR A\nDAY-TO-DAY KEEP THE MACHINE RUNNING AND GET EVERYBODY IN THE\nROOM THAT HAS TO BE THERE, MAKE SURE YOU'RE TOUCHING EVERY BASE\nYOU NEED TO. HE HAS A GREAT NATURAL LEADER OF\nA POLITICAL SYSTEM. HE DID PROBABLY THE MOST", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1479237660732.1479233352455.f34ae30e-d9ef-446e-b3fb-eb1f38510631.segment3.thumb.jpg", "channel": "360"}, {"start": 508380, "length": 34702.0, "end": 543082, "date": 1479238776543, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1479242278747.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1479238761102-cefab2fe-ac67-4883-8195-a9563a98c237-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=508.38,543.08", "text": ">>> WE HAVE A FOX NEWS ALERT\nFROM YOU.

I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT SHE\nFACED A CHALLENGE AFTER THE REPUBLICAN WIN IN 2010 WHEN THEY\nCLAIMED THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN THE BIG WAVE\nELECTION. HEATH SCHULER THE FORMER\nWASHINGTON REDSKINS QUARTERBACK, NORTH CAROLINA CONGRESSMAN, VERY\nCONSERVATIVE DEMOCRAT, CHALLENGE\nED HER AND HE GOT SACKED WITH ONLY 43 VOTES.\nNOBODY BE CAN BEAT NANCY PELOSI RIGHT NOW.\nTHERE IS ONE MEMBER WHO WE KEEP HEARING ABOUT IT, TIM RYAN, A\nTESTIMONY OF NORTHEAST OHIO. HE REPRESENTS YOUNGSTOWN, STEUBENVILLE, USED TO BE\nDEMOCRATIC UNION COUNTRY AND THEY WENT FOR TRUMP.\nAND TIM RYAN SAID THIS MORNING THAT IF WE DON'T SPEAK TO THOSE\nUNION VOTERS, WE WILL NEVER GET THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\nBACK. >> THIS ALL STARTED WOULD I\nBY PEOPLE CALLING ME, NOT ME\nCALLING PEOPLE, AND I THINK THERE WAS SOME ATTRACTION TO\nSOMEBODY FROM YOUNGSTOWN TO TALK TO UNION WOERKS WORKERS AND TRY\nTO CONNECT WITH PEOPLE. >> Reporter: I TALKED ALSO WITH\nMARCY KAPTUR, A DEMOCRAT FROM NORTHERN OHIO, SHE THE MOST\nSENIOR WOMAN IN CONGRESS RIGHT NOW, A PROTECTIONIST DEMOCRAT,\nSOMEBODY WHO OPPOSED TRADE DEALS AND THINGS.\nSHE WAS ON A LETTER EARLIER THIS WEEK ALONG WITH OTHER DEMOCRATIC\nWOMEN SUPPORTING NANCY PELOSI, BUT SHE SAYS SOMEONE FROM OUR\nPART OF THE COUNTRY, MEANING NORTHERN OHIO, MICHIGAN, UNION\nCOUNTRY, THE AREAS WHERE TRUMP PERFORMED SO WELL, ONE OF THE\nREASONS WHY HE WON OHIO, SHE MAY HAVE TO RECONSIDER THAT, SHEP.\n>> IT'S INTERESTING, THEY HAVE TO GET A FOOT HOLD IN AN AREA\nTHAT HAD BEEN A DEMOCRATIC STRONGHOLD AND NOW THEY HAVE TO\nREGROUP. BUT AS FAR AS HEAD OF THE DNC\nGOES, THIS MATTER OF KEITH ELLIS SO THAT, FIRST MUSLIM AMERICAN\nELECTED TO CONGRESS AS PUTTING HIMSELF OUT THERE AS OF LAST\nNIGHT FOR THAT JOB. WHAT DOES THAT TELL US?\n>> WELL, THAT IS THE INTERNAL STRUGGLE THAT IS GOING ON IN THE\nDEMOCRATIC PARTY RIGHT NOW. THEY SAY LOOK, WE WON THE\nPOPULAR VOTE, WE HAVE THE URBAN CORE WITH LATINOS AND\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS. PEOPLE WHO ARE LIBERAL IN THEIR\nPOLICIES. AND THAT HAS TO BE REPRESENTED.\nP THAT IS PART OF THE ENERGY THAT THEY GOT FROM THE BERNIE\nSANDERS CAMPAIGN. THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE ARE\nPEOPLE LIKE MARCY KAPTUR AND TIM RYAN WHERE THEY SAY THE REASON\nWHY WE DON'T HAVE THE SENATE OR THE HOUSE AND THE REAL REASON WE\nDON'T HAVE THE WHITE HOUSE IS WE COULDN'T SPEAK TO THOSE WHITE\nUNION MEMBERS IN MICHIGAN AND OHIO AND PENNSYLVANIA.\n>> ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, HIKE EMANUEL REPORTED NO DRAMA TODAY.\nBUT THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF DRAMA WITHIN THE TRANSITION\nTEAM. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE\nHAS BEEN NO CONTACT YET WITH THE PENTAGON OR DEPARTMENT OF STATE\nOR ANYTHING ELSE.

HIS PREDECESSOR, JOHN BOEHNER,\nJUST A COUPLE OF MINUTES AGO GIVING DONALD TRUMP THIS ADVICE.\n>> IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GET BIG THINGS DONE, YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE\nA REAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CONGRESS.\nAND THAT MEANS DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ON CAPITOL HILL.\n>> AND WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE MORE OF THAT INTERVIEW WITH THE\nFORMER HOUSE SPEAKER. DEMOCRATS DELAYING THEIR OWN\nNOMINATION FOR HOUSE LEADERSHIP. NOT A GOOD SIGN FOR LEADER NANCY\nPELOSI. WE'VE GOT REPORTERS ACROSS\nWASHINGTON AND CAPITOL HILL. KASIE HUNT AND PETER ALEXANDER\nAND KELLY O'DONNELL. KASIE, WHAT DO WE EXPECT TO SEE\nON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE? >> Reporter: HALLIE, SPEAKER\nPAUL RYAN REALLYXPECTED TO WALTZ RIGHT BACK IN TO BEING\nSPEAKER AGAIN AND HAS DONALD TRUMP TO THANK FOR THAT.\nIT'S ONE OF THE SPOTS OF UNITY HERE ON CAPITOL HILL.\nAND RYAN EARLIER TODAY WAS LEADING WHAT WAS REALLY QUITE\nTHE SHOW OF UNITY TODAY FROM THE HOUSE CONFERENCE WHEN MEMBERS\nWENT DOWN INTO THE BASEMENT HERE AT THE CAPITOL BUILDING TO TALK\nABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS.\nEVERY SEAT HAD A RED MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN HAT SITTING\nON IT AND AFTER THEIR MEETING, RYAN TALKED TO REPORTERS AND\nSAID WELCOME TO THE DAWN OF THE NEW UNITED REPUBLICAN CONGRESS.\nOF COURSE, THIS SHOW, SOME DIVISION THEY ARE GOING TO BE\nWRESTLING WITH PRIMARILY BETWEEN THE CONGRESS AND CONSERVATIVE\nREPUBLICANS WHO HAVE GOVERNED THE HOUSE HERE AND THE NEW\nPRESIDENT-ELECT WHO, QUITE FRANKLY, RAN ON A PLATFORM THAT\nWENT AGAINST A LOT OF THE IDEAS THAT CONSERVATIVES HERE IN\nWASHINGTON HAVE BEEN PUSHING FORWARD FOR A WHILE.\nDONALD TRUMP WAS POPULIST WHERE THIS HAS BEEN A REPUBLICAN\nCONGRESS THAT HAS PUSHED CUTTING THE SIZE OF GOVERNMENT, BACKING\nAWAY FROM THOSE THINGS, CUTTING DEBTS AND DEFICITS.\nTHEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GRAPPLE WITH SOME OF THOSE\nTHINGS AND I THINK YOU'RE STARTING TO SEE THE BEGINNING OF\nTHAT. ONE PARTICULAR STICKING POINT,\nSTEVE BANNON WHO OF COURSE HAS BEEN INSTALLED IN THE TRUMP\nWHITE HOUSE AS A SENIOR ADVISER, EQUAL TO REINCE PRIEBUS IN\nSTATURE, THE TRANSITION TELLS US.\nHE OF COURSE HAS MADE REMARKS OVER THE YEARS AND GIVEN PEOPLE\nPAUSE AND MANY OF THE ARTICLES PUBLISHED ON BREITBART, THE\nWEBSITE THAT HE RUNS, SOME OF THOSE REMARKS ARE ANTI-SEMITIC.\nTHAT'S SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN\nGETTING IN THE DAYS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN BACK UP HERE ON THE\nHILL. PAUL RYAN SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT,\nBANNON HELPED WIN THIS ELECTION FOR DONALD TRUMP AND HE WANTS TO\nLOOK FORWARD. REPUBLICANS HAVE ALSO SAID THAT\nTHEY HAVE OFTEN BEEN TALKING TO PRIEBUS.\nHE'S REALLY SOMEBODY WHO, AS BOEHNER TALKED ABOUT THEIR\nBUILDING THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH CONGRESS, HE'S GOING TO BE A GUY\nWHO REALLY KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON HERE ON CAPITOL HILL AND, OF\nCOURSE, MIKE PENCE, ANOTHER PIECE OF THAT.\nSO I THINK YOU'RE SEEING AN EFFORT HERE --\n>> CHRIS COLLINS, TOO, WILL BE PART OF THAT EFFORT TO BUILD\nBRIDGES THAT'S JUST COMING OUT? >> Reporter: YES.\nAND IN COLLINS, HE'S PART OF THE TRANSITION TEAM.\nHE'S GOING TO STAY IN CONGRESS TO PLAY THAT VERY ROLE.\nI ASKED, ARE THE REPUBLICANS WHO ARE NERVOUS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP\nAS PRESIDENT, WE DIDN'T SEE A LOT OF GETTING ON THE BANDWAGON.\nCOLLINS SAID TO ME, HEY, I SUPPORTED DONALD TRUMP FROM THE\nVERY BEGINNING AND I SAID, OKAY, COLLINS -- IT WAS A PRETTY\nLONELY PLACE TO BE. JUST CHRIS COLLINS THERE FOR A\nWHILE. BUT HE'S IN A VERY GOOD PLACE\nNOW, HALLIE. >> THAT'S FOR SURE, KASIE.\nI WANT TO HEAD OVER TO PETER ALEXANDER.\nWE HAVE WATCHING THAT JOHN BOEHNER INTERVIEW.\nHE SAID HE WAS SURPRISED BUT NOT SHOCKED THAT DONALD TRUMP WON.\nBOEHNER VOTED FOR TRUMP. HE SAID HE WOULD VOTING FOR THE\nPRESIDENT-ELECT. AS WE TALK ABOUT THE ROLE THAT\nCONGRESSMAN COLLINS WILL PLAY, THERE'S SOMEBODY ELSE NOT\nPLAYING AS MUCH OF A ROLE ANYMORE AND THAT'S CHRIS\nCHRISTIE. WE'VE BEEN CHATTING ABOUT THIS.\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO CALL IT? A PURGE OF CHRISTIE FOLKS FROM\nTHE CAMPAIGN? >> THEY HAVE BEEN OFF TO A SLOW\nSTART, BOGGED DOWN BY THE ABRUPT RESIGNATION OF THE FORMER\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKE ROGERS. THIS IS A MAN THAT MANY PEOPLE\nTHOUGHT WOULD BE CONSIDERED AS A POTENTIAL CIA DIRECTOR.\nHE WAS OVERSEEING THE TRANSITIONS NATIONAL SECURITY\nEFFORTS BUT WE'VE LEARNED FROM TWO SOURCES CLOSE TO ROGERS THAT\nHE IS BASICALLY OUT AS A RESULT OF WHAT THEY DESCRIBE AS A,\nQUOTE, STALINESQUE PURGE TAKING PLACE WITH THOSE WITH CLOSE TIES\nTO THE NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR, CHRIS CHRISTIE.\nIT'S UNCLEAR WHO ELSE IS AFFECTED BY THAT.\nHOW DOES THAT IMPACT THE PLANS IN TERMS OF CIA AND OTHERS GOING\nFORWARD? WE'RE TOLD THAT THE REPUBLICAN\nFROM CALIFORNIA, THE 22nd DISSTRICT, HIS NAME IS DEVON\nNUNEZ, HE'S BEING CONSIDERED RIGHT NOW.\nHE'S ALSO THE REPUBLICAN CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE\nINTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, A MAN FAMILIAR WITH THE WAY\nINTELLIGENCE WORKS. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE HERE IS,\nTHIS SORT OF FIGHT AMONG LOYALISTS VERSUS THOSE WHO HAVE\nNOT BEEN SUFFICIENTLY LOYAL WITHIN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND\nTHE BOTTOM LINE BEING CHRIS CHRISTIE WHO, OF COURSE,\nPROSECUTED JARED KUSHNER'S FATHER.\nANYONE ASSOCIATED IT WITH HIM MAY BE PUSHED ASIDE.\n>> PETER, HANG SITE. I WANT TO BRING IN KELLY\nO'DONNELL. VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT MIKE PENCE\nIS MEETING WITH PRESIDENT-ELECT IN THE TRUMP TOWER.\nTHE TWO ARE DISCUSSING SOME OF THESE NAMES FOR THE NEXT\nADMINISTRATION, SOME CABINET NAMES.\nTHERE'S A POSSIBILITY WE MAY GET A MORE THOROUGH READOUT FROM\nTHAT IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS AND THEY MAY ALSO BE GETTING THE\nSO-CALLED PRESIDENTIAL DAILY BRIEFING.\nTALK TO US ABOUT YOUR REPORTING ON THIS.\n>> Reporter: THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS AVAILABLE TO THE\nPRESIDENT-ELECT ONCE HE WON THE OFFICE AND IT IS SORT OF NOTABLE\nTHAT IT'S NOW A WEEK LATER AND OUR SOURCING TELLS US THAT IT\nWILL HAPPEN TODAY AND THIS WILL BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR BOTH\nPRESIDENT-ELECT, VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT PENCE TO RECEIVE\nTHIS INFORMATION IDENTICAL TO WHAT IS DELIVERED TO BARACK\nOBAMA EACH DAY AND CONTAINS INTELLIGENCE SUMMARIES OF THE\nHOT SPOTS AROUND THE WORLD, THE SOURCES AND METHODS.\nESSENTIALLY, IT'S A FILE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S SECRETS AND THE\nTHREATS THAT ARE IMMINENT ON A DAILY BASIS.\nTHIS IS, OF COURSE, TO HELP A LEADER SHAPE THEIR VIEW OF WHERE\nTHEIR ATTENTION MUST BE DEALING WITH THE WORLD AND AT THIS TIME\nOF TRANS SIX, IT'S CRITICAL BECAUSE THERE ARE JOBS TO FILL\nTHAT WILL RELATE TO SOME OF THESE HOT SPOTS.\nTHINK OF SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, THINK OF SECRETARY OF STATE.\nIT'S NOTABLE THAT THIS IS HAPPENING TODAY AND REQUIRES TOP\nSECRET CLEARANCE WHICH TRUMP AND PENCE GET BY VIRTUE OF WINNING\nTHE ELECTION AND THEY ARE DOING IT IN NEW YORK AND THIS IS\nSOMETHING THAT WILL BE A REGULAR PART OF THEIR LIVES GOING\nFORWARD. BUT BECAUSE THE GEARS OF THIS\nTRANSITION HAVE BEEN SLOW TO GET GOING, IT TOOK A WEEK FOR THIS\nTO TAKE PLACE. HALLIE?\n>> YOU'RE IN WASHINGTON AND FOLLOWING SIMULTANEOUSLY THIS\nHOUSE DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP BATTLE.\nWHAT SDUS THIS MEAN GOING FORWARD?\n>> IT'S THE STAGES OF GRIEF. THEY SAW WHAT HAPPENED ACROSS\nTHE BOARD AND VOTERS ARE SENDING THEM A MESSAGE AND NEED TIME TO\nPROCESS THIS. THE ORIGINAL PLAN WAS TO HOLD\nTHE LEADERSHIP ELECTIONS THIS WEEK.\nTHAT IS NOW BEING PUT OFF UNTIL TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 30th.\nTHIS WILL GIVE THE CAUCUS TIME TO SEE IF THEY WANT TO GO IN A\nNEW DIRECTION, WILL THEY STAY WITH LEADER PELOSI WHO'S BEEN IN\nCHARGE WITH DEMOCRATS FOR MANY YEARS NOW AND SOME OF THIS IS\nPART OF SORT OF THE SPASM OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THERE IS\nUNEXPECTED DEFEAT. DEMOCRATS THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE\nA LOT OF COAT TAILS BEHIND HILLARY CLINTON ASSUMING SHE\nWOULD BECOME PRESIDENT AND THEY WOULD BENEFIT IN CONGRESS AND\nTHAT DID NOT HAPPEN AND SO THEY FEEL THAT THEY'VE GOT TO LOOK AT\nTHE IMPRESSIVE PARTY OF THE LEADERSHIP.\nTHIS IS IN SOME WAYS BEHIND THE SCENES MACINATIONS THAT GO ON\nAND DEMOCRATS TRYING TO ASSESS HOW ARE THEY AND HOW THEY WILL\nGO FORWARD. WE'LL SEE DEMOCRATS STRUGGLING\nWITH THIS WHAT HE IS THE RIGHT ANSWER AND WHAT SHOULD THEY\nLEARN FROM THIS FOR DAYS TO COME.\nTHEY WILL STEP BEHIND LEADERSHIP BUT WILL THERE BE NEW FACES?\nTHAT'S WHAT WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH. >> AND KELLY AND PETER,\nSOMETHING INTERESTING POPPED INTO MY E-MAIL HERE THAT TRUMP\nPLACE IN NEW YORK IS IN THE PROCESS OF CHANGING NAMES TO\nTHEIR STREET ADDRESSES AND WE ARE ASSUMING A MORE NEUTRAL\nBUILDING IDENTITY THAT WILL APPEAL TO ALL CURRENT AND FUTURE\nRESIDENTS. SO PETER, I'M THROWING THIS TO\nYOU AS A CURVEBALL BUT ONE THING WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT IS SORT OF\nTHE BUSINESS BRAND OF PRESIDENT-ELECT AND THE EFFECT\nTHE ELECTION COULD HAVE ON THOSE.\n>> MORE SPECIFIC TO THIS PARTICULAR PROPERTY, THIS IS ONE\nWHICH THE TRUMP BRANDING ON THE OUTSIDE OF IT BUT INSIDE OF IT,\nA LOT OF PEOPLE WHO OPPOSED DONALD TRUMP.\nWE WERE THERE NOT TOO LONG AGO WHEN THIS PETITION WAS FIRST\nCREATED THAT SAID THEY WANTED TO REMOVE HIS NAME FROM IT BECAUSE\nTHEY SAID DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T REPRESENT THE VALUES OF SO MANY\nOF THE TENANTS AT THAT PROPERTY RIGHT THERE.\nTHAT SHOWS YOU ONE INDICATION OF THIS RIGHT NOW.\nWE'VE REPORTED OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS IT\nREMAINS TO BE SEEN, EVEN AS AMERICA TRIES TO UNITE BEHIND\nTHIS NEW PRESIDENT TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE IN THE WORDS OF PRESIDENT\nOBAMA THAT EVEN AT PROPERTIES LIKE THE TRUMP PROPERTY IN\nCHICAGO, THE HOTEL THERE, MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL PLAYERS FOR THE\nLOS ANGELES DODGERS REFUSED TO STAY THERE WITH HIS TEAM EARLIER\nIN THE YEAR. THE TEAM ON A FUTURE VISIT TO\nCHICAGO CHOSE TO GO ELSEWHERE. THE BOTTOM LINE IS, IT'S STILL\nNOT JUST A DIVIDED COUNTRY BUT THERE ARE DIVIDED OPINIONS ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP WIDELY AND HOW THAT PLAYS NOT JUST IN HIS ROLE AT\nTHE WHITE HOUSE BUT IN THE BRAND MORE BROADLY IS STILL SOMETHING\nWE CAN PAY ATTENTION TO CLOSELY. >> PETER ALEXANDER, KELLY\nO'DONNELL, KASIE HUNT BEFORE THAT, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US\nHERE AT THE 1:00 HOUR. I WANT TO GO BACK TO CAPITOL\nHILL. CONGRESSMAN ISRAEL, ALSO A\nFORMER CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE IN CHARGE OF RE-ELECTING HOUSE\nDEMOCRATS. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.\n>> GREAT TO BE WITH YOU. THANK YOU.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS HOUSE LEADERSHIP -- I DON'T KNOW IF\nYOU WANT TO CALL IT A FIGHT BUT THE DRAMA UNFOLDING ON THAT\nSIDE. DOES THIS DELAY NOW A SIGNAL A\nTHREAT TO LEADER NANCY PELOSI'S ROLE WITHIN THE PARTY?\n>> I DON'T THINK IT SIGNAL AS THREAT.\nIT'S A HEALTHY CONVERSATION. WE NEED TO DO SOME SOUL\nSEARCHING AND TAP INTO THE ANXIETIES OF MIDDLE CLASS VOTERS\nTHROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. THIS IS A NECESSARY\nCONVERSATION. I DO NOT WANT IT TO BECOME AN\nUNNECESSARY DISTRACTION. WE NEED TO BE FIGHTING AGAINST\nDONALD TRUMP RIGHT NOW.

WHEN ALL THE VOTES ARE COUNTED\nIT NOW APPEARS HILLARY CLINTON WILL HAVE GOTTEN ABOUT 2 MILLION\nMORE VOTES THAN DONALD TRUMP GOT, BUT NOT DISTRIBUTED AS\nREQUIRED BY THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE.\nAND I THINK A MISTAKE WAS MADE. THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE\nEFFORTS, CLEARLY IN THE UPPER MIDWEST AND RURAL AMERICA.\nHILLARY DID NOT DO WELL. THE DEMOCRATS DO NOT DO WELL\nGENERALLY IN RURAL AMERICA OR WITH WORKING CLASS VOTERS.\nI THINK OUR CASE IS STRONG THERE BUT IT WASN'T MADE PROPERLY AND\nCERTAINLY NOT ADEQUATELY. >> TYPICALLY THE ELECTORAL\nCOLLEGE FAVORS THE DEMOCRATS. DOES IT NEED TO BE --\n>> NO THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE DOES NOT FAVOR DEMOCRATS.\nTHE ELECTORAL COLLEGE UNTIL RECENTLY ALWAYS WENT ALONG WITH\nWHOEVER WON THE POPULAR VOTE. SINCE 1888.\nTHE ONLY TIME IT DIDN'T IS IN 2000 WHEN BUSH WAS DECLARED THE\nWINNER BUT AL GORE WON BY HALF A MILLION VOTES IN THE POPULAR\nVOTE.

THIS SEEMS TO BE A POINT OF\nPARTY UNITY BY DEMOCRATS. ISN'T DONALD TRUMP ALLOWED TO\nPICK HIS OWN CABINET APPOINTMENTS?\n>> HE'S ALLOWED TO PICK WHOEVER HE WANTS BY LAW AND WE'RE\nALLOWED TO CRITICIZE WHENEVER HE DOES SOMETHING DISGUSTING.\nTHIS IS DISGUSTING. I WOULDN'T USE THAT WORD LIGHTLY\nIN TALKING ABOUT AN APPOINTMENT OF A GOVERNOR OR MAYOR OR\nPRESIDENT. BUT TO APPOINT SOMEONE WHO IS AN\nOUT AND OUT RACIST, ANTI-SEMITE, A LEADER OF THE ALT-RIGHT, WHICH\nMR. BANNON HIMSELF IS A MODERNIZED CLEANED UP VERSION OF\nTHE SKINHEAD RACISTS, THAT'S HIS QUOTE, IS DISGUSTING.\nIT'S A TERRIBLE THING.

I THINK YOUR BROAD BIPARTISAN\nSUPPORT ON THE HILL FOR THIS TYPE OF PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND\nI THINK IT'S GOING TO BE SO POPULAR THAT IF I WERE PRESIDENT\nTRUMP, I WOULD ATTACH AN INCREASE IN THE DEBT LIMIT TO IT\nAS WELL, WHICH IS GOING TO COME UP IN MARCH AND GET THAT MONKEY\nOFF HIS BACK. >> ARE YOU NOT IN FAVOR THEN OF\nA BIG DEFICIT -- A BIG STIMULUS BACKAGE THAT INCLUDES A LARGE\nINFRASTRUCTURE INITIATIVE? >> I DON'T KNOW THAT WE NEED A\nSTIMULUS PACKAGE. WE NEED INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING\nIN A BIG WAY. IT WILL HELP THE ECONOMY\nSOMEWHAT. TAX REFORM IN A BROADER SENSE\nWOULD DO MORE FOR OUR ECONOMY, DO MORE TO CREATE ECONOMIC\nGROWTH AND BETTER JOBS IN AMERICA THAN JUST AN\nINFRASTRUCTURE BILL ON SOMETHING.\n>> WHAT ABOUT REGULATION? THERE'S SOME SUGGESTION AND\nCERTAINLY MR. TRUMP ON THE TRAIL TALKED ABOUT DODD FRANK.\nDO YOU THINK DODD FRANK SHOULD BE REPEALED?\n>> I THINK DODD FRANK HAS BEEN A DISASTER.\nYOU KNOW, IT ALL STARTED GOING AFTER THE BIG GUYS WHO CAUSED\nTHE PROBLEM, AND AS IT TURNED OUT, SAYS IT HIT EVERYBODY IN\nTHE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY EXCEPT THE TEN BIG GUYS WHO\nCAUSED THE PROBLEM. IT'S THE CRAZIEST THING I'VE\nEVER SEEN. SO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER ALL OF\nIT GOES, BUT THERE ARE GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES, AND I\nBELIEVE A LOT OF THAT WILL HAVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT ON THE HILL.\n>> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF HIS COMMENTS ALREADY TALKING ABOUT\nPRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP THAT HE IS OPEN TO KEEPING PARTS OF OBAMA\nCARE? >> WELL, EVERYBODY IS OPEN TO\nKEEPING PARTS OF OBAMA CARE. >> THAT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE\nCANDIDATE TRUMP. >> THE HEALTH INDUSTRY BASICALLY\nHAVE DECIDED THAT COVERING PEOPLE WITH PREEXISTING\nCONDITIONS IS WHAT'S APPROPRIATE IN THIS ERA.\nTHE HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRY ALSO PRETTY MUCH HAVE DECIDED\nTHAT COVERING KIDS STAYING AT HOME UNTIL AGE 26 IS AN INDUSTRY\nSTANDARD. THOSE ARE THINGS THAT HAVE BROAD\nBIPARTISAN SUPPORT. LISTEN, WE TALK ABOUT -- OBAMA\nCARE IS A BIG BILL. WHILE A LOT OF IT'S BAD, NOT ALL\nOF IT IS BAD, AS PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP HAS POINTED OUT.\n>> DO YOU HAVE AN ISSUE WITH HIS COMMENTS REGARDING TRADE?\nWE'VE ALREADY HEARD SOME PUSHBACK FROM THE CHINESE\nTALKING ABOUT, WELL, WE'LL REPLACE BOEING WITH AIRBUS,\niPHONE SALES COULD HAVE A PROBLEM.\n>> WELL, I BELIEVE IN TRADE. I THINK TRADE HAS BEEN VERY GOOD\nTO THE U.S. YES, IT'S CAUSED SOME JOB\nDISLOCATION, BUT ON THE WHOLE, IT HAS HELPED OUR ECONOMY IN A\nBIG WAY. NOW, SO THE PRESIDENT AND I\nDISAGREE ABOUT THAT. I THINK HOW THE PRESIDENT CAN\nKEEP HIS CAMPAIGN PROMISES IS TO LOOK AT THE ENFORCEMENT OF THESE\nTRADE LAWS BECAUSE THE ENFORCEMENT, FRANKLY, IS WHERE I\nTHINK THE HOLES ARE THAT CAUSE PEOPLE CONCERN.\nI MEAN, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CHINESE CONTINUING TO DUMP STEEL\nIN THE UNITED STATES, HERE'S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF WRL THEY OUGHT\nTO BE TAKING UP THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE EXISTING TRADE LAWS.\nTAKING A LOOK BACK AT NAFTA AFTER 22 YEARS, FRANCLY, I THINK\nIS A VERY GOOD IDEA. IT PROBABLY NEEDS A TUNE-UP.\nI DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S GOING TO GET THE KIND OF TUNE-UP THAT\nPRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP WOULD LIKE, BUT REVISITING THIS IS IN\nTHE COUNTRY'S BEST INTEREST. >> THE COMMENTS THAT THE\nPRESIDENT-ELECT MADE ABOUT OBAMA CARE, WHICH WE JUST DISCUSSED.\nTHE OTHER ONES HE TOLD \"60 MINUTES\" THAT HE IS FINE WITH\nSAME-SEX MARRIAGE. THOSE ARE HIS WORDS.\nTHE WALL COULD BE A FENCE IN SOME SPOTS.\nHOW IS THAT GOING TO PLAY WITH THE ALT RIGHT?\nTHE FAR RIGHT THAT HELPED PUSH IT OVER THE TOP.\n>> THEY UNDERSTAND THAT DONALD TRUMP IS BARELY A REPUBLICAN.\nTHAT'S WHEN IT COMES TO THE SOCIAL ISSUES.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE PARTY ARE --\n>> DOES HE NEED TO BE MORE OF A REPUBLICAN NOW?\n>> OH, I THINK DONALD TRUMP NEEDS TO BE DONALD TRUMP.\nWHEN IT COMES TO A WALL, LISTEN, SAYS I VOTED TO SPEND MONEY\nTOBLD A WALL IN SOME SECTIONS, BUT THERE ARE PARTS OF THE\nBORDER WHERE IT'S JUST NOT PRACTICAL AT ALL, AND SO THERE\nARE -- YOU CAN CREATE A BARRIER WITHOUT NECESSARILY BUILDING A\nWALL. WHAT THAT BARRIER COULD BE, IT\nCOULD BE DRONES, IT COULD BE TECHNOLOGY, IT COULD BE A FENCE\nAS OPPOSED TO A WALL. THERE ARE A LOT OF OPTIONS THAT\nARE OUT THERE. THE KEY HERE IS THE BORDER NEEDS\nTO BE SECURED. THAT'S ABOUT AN 80-20 ISSUE IN\nTHE UNITED STATES. I THINK THEY CAN SECURE THE\nBORDER. >> SINCE IN SOME RESPECTS WE'RE\nTALKING ABOUT THE FUTURE OF YOUR PARTY, WHAT ROLE SHOULD PAUL\nRYAN PLAY IN THAT? SHOULD HE REMAIN SPEAKER?\n>> ABSOLUTELY. PAUL RYAN IS A REALLY SMART GUY.\nHARD WORKER. A GREAT FAMILY MAN.\nFRANKLY, WELL RESPECTED BY HIS COLLEAGUES.\nOVER THE LAST YEAR HE HAS NEEDED TO LEARN A NEW TRAIT.\nTHAT IS HOW TO BE A LEADER. HE HAS GROWN TREMENDOUSLY OVER\nTHIS LAST YEAR. HE IS GOING TO BE OVERWHELMINGLY\nRE-ELECTED TODAY AS THE NEXT SPEAKER-ELECT.\nHE WILL BE ELECTED ON THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE WHEN THE NEW\nCONGRESS OPENS IN EARLY JANUARY. I THINK HE CAN BE DONALD TRUMP'S\nLEGISLATIVE PARTNER IN CHIEF. PAUL RYAN IS A LEGISLATOR.\nHE IS A POLICY -- HE KNOWS THESE POLICY ISSUES INSIDE AND OUT.\nHE CAN BE A GREAT ASSET WORKING WITH ONE OF HIS BEST FRIENDS\nREINCE PRIEBUS, WHO IS THE NEW CHIEF OF STAFF FOR THE\nPRESIDENT-ELECT AND THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF.\n>> HAVE YOU SPOKE WITH REPRESENTATIVE RYAN?\n>> I HAVE. >> IS HE CONFIDENT IN THE THINGS\nTHAT AND THE PREDICTIONS THAT YOU MADE?\nJIM JORDAN, HEAD OF THE FREEDOM CAUCUS, CERTAINLY HASN'T COME\nOUT, AND HE IS CONSIDERED MAYBE THE SECOND MOST POWERFUL\nREPUBLICAN ON THE HILL. IN THE HOUSE.\n>> JIM JORDAN AND PAUL RYAN HAVE A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP.\n>> DO THEY? >> IN SPITE OF THEIR\nDIFFERENCES. I THINK PAUL IS IN REALLY GOOD\nSHAPE. >> YOU THINK HE WILL RUN FOR\nPRESIDENT? >> YOU KNOW, AT SOME POINT I\nWOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT. HE WOULD MAKE A GREAT PRESIDENT.\n>> HOW IS YOUR GOLF GAME? >> NEEDS A LITTLE HELP.\n>> WELL, YOU'RE DOWN HERE IN FLORIDA.\nI KNOW YOU KEEP A PLACE DOWN HERE AS WELL.\nI APPRECIATE YOUR TIME VERY MUCH TODAY, SIR.\n>> GOOD TO BE SHEER. >> FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE\nJOINING US TODAY EXCLUSIVELY ON CNBC.\nAHEAD ON \"THE HALFTIME REPORT\", CME GROUP CHAIRMAN TERRY DUFFY\nWILL JOIN US RIGHT HERE ON SET FROM NAPLES.\nWE'LL TALK MARKETS.

I ASKED THE FORMER SPEAKER WHAT\nSHOULD BE ON THE TOP OF DONALD TRUMP'S LIST.\nAND HERE IS WHAT HE TOLD ME. >> DONALD TRUMP IS NOT AN\nIDEOLOGUE.

TRUMP MOVES MORE TOWARDS THE RIGHT OR\nIF HE CONTINUES WHAT SOME SAY IS A PATH TOWARDS THE CENTER.\nAT LEAST ON A FEW OF THE MAJOR ISSUES THAT ARE OUT THERE, GUYS.\n>> I THINK IT IS AN INTERESTING THOUGHT BECAUSE HE'S CERTAINLY\nNOT A PHILOSOPHICAL REPUBLICAN.

I THINK BACK TO THE TIME IN THE\n70s WHEN NIXON MADE THE OVERTURE TO CHINA.\nTHERE IS AN ARGUMENT TO BE MADE THAT NO ONE BUT NIXON COULD HAVE\nTAKEN THAT STEP AND MAYBE THERE IS AN ANALOGOUS SITUATION, WITH\nRESPECT TO IMMIGRATION, THAT NO ONE BUT AS FIERCE A GUY ON\nIMMIGRATION AS TRUMP COULD MOVE THE COUNTRY TOWARD AN\nIMMIGRATION REFORM. >> THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS,\nI'M SORRY, YEAH, I WAS GOING TO SAY, THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS\nTHAT NOBODY REALLY KNOWS WHAT KIND OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP\nIS GOING TO BE AND THAT INCLUDES WHETHER IT WAS GARY CONE OF\nGOLDMAN SACHS OR THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, JOHN BOEHNER.\nTHE STOCK MARKET HAS REANTED  DAYS, BUT ON ALL ISSUES,\nIMMIGRATION OR TAX REFORM OR STIMULUS OR INFRASTRUCTURE,\nWHICHEVER ONE YOU WANT TO CALL IT, WE DON'T KNOW.\n>> QUITE A FEW TIMES WHERE YOU ASK HIM A QUESTION AND HE WILL\nSAY, WE'LL SEE. WE'LL SEE.\nHE DOESN'T KNOW. >> WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT PAUL\nRYAN? >> THERE WAS MORE CERTAINTY AS\nTO HOW HE FEELS ABOUT PAUL RYAN AND A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS OUT\nTHERE AS TO WHETHER PAUL RYAN SHOULD REMAIN THE SPEAKER OF THE\nHOUSE. HE TOLD ME EMPHATICALLY HE\nSHOULD. HERE'S WHAT HE SAID.\n>> ABSOLUTELY. PAUL RYAN IS A REALLY SMART GUY,\nHARD WORKER, GREAT FAMILY MAN, AND, FRANKLY, WELL RESPECTED BY\nHIS COLLEAGUES.

NOT ONLY -- IT'S ONLY NATURAL TO\nEXPECT THAT TO HAPPEN IN THE EARLY DAYS OF AN ADMINISTRATION.\n>> WHAT IS SIGNIFICANT HERE IS THAT WE HAVE HAD WITHIN THE LAST\nSEVERAL DAYS WE HAVE HAD A TURNOVER OF THE LEADERSHIP OF\nTHE TRANSITION OFFICE. CHRIS CHRISTIE WAS THE LEADER OF\nTHAT OFFICE. HE WAS BUMPED OUT, DEMOTED AND\nMIKE PENCE HAS BECOME THE HEAD OF THAT EFFORT.\nSO MIKE ROGERS IS ONE OF THE CASUALTIES OF THAT CHANGE AND\nTHERE MAY BE OTHER CHRISTIE CONFIDENTS WHO ARE FALLING OUT\nOF RUNNINGS OF BIG JOBS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION.\nTHAT'S NOT A KIND OF TURN WE SEE USUALLY AT THIS POINT IN THE\nPROCESS. >> WE HEARD FROM JOHN BOEHNER\nBUT HOW HE THOUGHT TRUMP WOULD GOVERN AND WHAT KIND OF\nPRESIDENT HE THOUGHT HE WOULD BE.\n>> DONALD TRUMP IS NOT AN IDEAL.

LET'S LISTEN IN TO PRESIDENT\nOBAMA AND THE GREEK PRESIDENT. >> Translator: I WANTED TO TELL\nTHE AMERICAN PRESIDENT, PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA, VERY\nWARMLY FOR VISITING GREECE, FOR CHOOSING ATHENS, THE BIRTH PLACE\nOF DEMOCRACY FOR ONE OF HIS LAST STOPS BEFORE CONCLUDING HIS\nEIGHT-YEAR TERM AS THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT.\nTHE PRESIDENCY DURING WHICH THE INFLUENCE OF THE UNITED STATES\nOF AMERICA AROUND THE WORLD HAS CHANGED, EVEN IN THIS COUNTRY\nWHERE DURING THE COLD WAR ERA GREEK/AMERICAN RELATIONS WERE --\nHAVE ACCUMULATED HEAVY HISTORIC BURDEN -- A VERY HEAVY\nHISTORICAL BURDEN. I THINK THAT IT WAS A HISTORICAL\nMOMENT WHEN DURING THE PREVIOUS VISIT OF AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT\nIN GREECE IN 1999 PRESIDENT CLINTON RECOGNIZED THE ERRORS OF\nTHE U.S. AS REGARDS TO THE DICTATORSHIP IN GREECE BECAUSE\nTHE AMERICANS -- THE GREEK PEOPLE NOT ONLY RELATE TO THE\nANCIENT TRADITIONS, THEY HAVE FOUGHT, THEY HAVE SHED BLOOD\nUNTIL RECENTLY TO DEFEND THE VALUES OF DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM,\nWHICH ARE OUR COMMON VALUES. THEREFORE, GREECE IS NOW\nWELCOMING AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT WHO THROUGHOUT HIS TERM IN\nOFFICE HAS STRONGLY DEFENDED THESE VALUES, WHO HAS FOUGHT FOR\nTHE RIGHTS OF ALL PEOPLE IRRESPECTIVE OF COLOR, RELIGION,\nOR SEXUAL ORIENTATION, WHO HAS WORKED IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH\nCLIMATE CHANGE, A PRESIDENT WHO HAS INTEGRATED MILLIONS OF\nAMERICANS INTO HEALTH CARE, A PRESIDENT WHO HAS PUT HIS\nSTRENGTH AND HIS INFLUENCE BEHIND A HUMANITARIAN SOLUTION\nOF THE GREAT REFUGEE CRISIS, THE GREATEST AFTER WORLD WAR II.\nAND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT BECAUSE THIS IS VERY\nIMPORTANT TO GREECE. THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO WHEN HE\nHAD TO DEAL WITH THE 2008 ECONOMIC CRISIS HAS LED THE\nAMERICAN ECONOMY ON A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PATH FROM THE ONE THAT\nEUROPE HAS CHOSEN EIGHT YEARS LATER.\nTHE RESULT IS MORE THAN VISIBLE. QUANTITATIVE EASING, COMMITMENT\nTO EMPLOYMENT WHICH WAS THE CHOICE OF THE UNITED STATES HAVE\nLED TO IMPRESSED GROWTH RATES AND DECLINING UNEMPLOYMENT.\nWHILE ON THE OTHER SIDE THE INSISTENCE OF EUROPEAN LEADERS\nTHROUGH AUSTERITY POLICIES KEEPS THE EUROPEAN ECONOMY STRAPPED\nSTAGNATION AND IT, THEREFORE, BRINGS ABOUT HUGE POLITICAL AND\nSOCIAL PROBLEMS AND IT IS IN THIS RESPECT THAT I HAVE THE\nOPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA THE HUGE\nCHALLENGES THAT OUR COUNTRY BUT ALSO THE WHOLE OF EUROPE IS\nDEALING WITH. THESE ARE CHALLENGES THAT NEED\nTO BE DEALT WITH COLLECTIVELY, DECISIVELY, AND EFFECTIVELY,\nOTHERWISE, WE WILL BE LED TO -- BACKWARDS.\nWE ARE HOPEFUL THAT IT'S THE ONLY DECLINE AGAINST THE\nINCREASING TREND IN SKEPTICISM AND INWARD LOOKING WHICH IS A\nTHREAT. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WHEN\nTRYING TO AVOID HISTORIC MISTAKES OF THE PAST IN 1953 AND\nWITH THE ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\nTHEY SETTLED THE GERMAN DEBT AND TO A GROWTH CLAUSE.\nWITH THE MOST -- THE HASHEST.  AS AN ECONOMY AND AS A SOCIETY\nWE HAVE HAD TO EXPERIENCE A PROGRAM OF DISASTROUS AUSTERITY\nWHICH MADE THE PROBLEMS MORE ACUTE INSTEAD OF RESOLVING THEM.\nWITHIN A FEW YEARS WE HAVE LOST 25% OF OUR GDP WHILE IN 2004\nUNEMPLOYMENT WENT UP TO 27%. TODAY AND DESPITE THAT WE HAVE\nSUFFERED, WE ARE STILL STANDING. WE WERE ABLE THROUGH GREAT\nSACRIFICES TO AVOID THE THREATS AND THREATENED DISASTER AND WE\nARE STEP BY STEP RESTORING OUR ECONOMY.\nTODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS WE ARE BACK TO GROWTH,\nSLOWLY BUT SURELY WE ARE DECREASING UNEMPLOYMENT AND WE\nARE RESTORING CONFIDENCE TO THE FUTURE OF THE GREEK ECONOMY.\nABOUT 18 MONTHS AGO ALTHOUGH WE WERE A YOUNG GOVERNMENT WE WERE\nASKED TO TAKE VERY DIFFICULT DECISIONS AND WITH THIS\nOPPORTUNITY I WANT TO RECOGNIZE PUBLICLY THE ROLE AND THE\nCONTRIBUTION OF PRESIDENT OBAMA DURING THOSE DIFFICULT MOMENTS\nTO RECOGNIZE HIS MORAL AND POLITICAL SUPPORT HE GAVE TO MY\nGOVERNMENT IN THE EFFORT TO FIND A POLITICAL SOLUTION.\nDIFFICULT DECISIONS WERE MADE, NOT ONLY IN ORDER TO KEEP OUR\nCOUNTRY IN THE EUROZONE BUT ALSO IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE\nCOHESION OF THE EUROPEAN UNION.

WE HAVE MADE DIFFICULT REFORMS\nIN THE SOCIAL SECURITY, IN TAXATION, IN PUBLIC\nADMINISTRATION, BUT I HAVE -- WE HAVE ALWAYS TAKEN MEASURES TO\nFIGHT CORRUPTION, TO ATTRACT INVESTMENT, TO CREATE A BETTER\nCONTEXT FOR INVESTMENT IN GREECE.\nWE WILL CONTINUE TO DECISIVELY PROMOTE REFORMS THAT WILL\nPROMOTE GROWTH AND AT THE SAME TIME WE WILL CONTINUE TO\nNEGOTIATE HARD IN ORDER TO AVOID ANY REFORMS THAT WOULD UNDERMINE\nGROWTH, BUT WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT TO ALL OF US IS THAT\nSOCIETY SHOULD UNDERSTAND -- SHOULD FEEL THE RESULTS OF ALL\nOF THAT AND TO MAKE THE BURDEN TO THE WEAK MEMBERS OF SOCIETY\nLIGHTER AND ALSO FOR THE YOUNGER AND PRODUCTIVE GENERATION\nBECAUSE AFTER SEVEN YEARS PEOPLE CANNOT TAKE ANYMORE AUSTERITY.\nTHE IMPORTANT REDUCTION OF THE GREEK DEBT, THE REDUCTION OF THE\nSURPLUSES WHICH ARE EXPECTED OF US IN THE FUTURE AND THE\nPARTICIPATION OF THE BANK OF GREECE IN THE QUANTITATIVE\nEASING PROGRAM ARE RIGHTFULLY -- SHOULD BE RIGHTFULLY GIVEN TO\nGREECE AND THE TIME TO DO THAT IS NOW.\nAND FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW, I THINK THAT IT IS NOT ONLY\nSYMBOLIC BUT IT IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT THAT BARACK OBAMA IS\nNOW IN ATHENS AND THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW WILL BE IN BERLIN AT\nTHIS VERY CRITICAL POINT IN TIME WHEN DECISIONS ARE EXPECTED.\nDECISIONS THAT NOT ONLY CONCERN GREECE, THEY CONCERN EUROPE AND,\nTHEREFORE, THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. COOPERATION AND SOLIDARITY ARE\nNECESSARY REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER TO BRING ABOUT THE SOLUTIONS\nTHAT WILL ONCE AGAIN BRING STABILITY TO THE EUROPEAN\nINTEGRATION AND BRING IT BACK TO THE TRACKF GROWTH.\nAND IN RELATION TO THAT, PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I DISCUSSED\nA NUMBER OF IMPORTANT THINGS, SUCH AS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE\nIMPORTANT POTENTIAL FOR INVESTMENTS IN GREECE, IN A\nSERIES OF SECTORS SUCH AS ENERGY, TOURISM, RESEARCH AND\nTECHNOLOGY. WE ALSO DISCUSSED THE FUTURE\nWHERE GREECE WITH ITS IMPORTANT SHIPPING POWER CAN BECOME AN\nIMPORTANT TRANSIT CENTER FOR TRADE, TRANSPORT AND ENERGY\nLINKING EUROPE TO ASIA AND TO NORTH AFRICA.\nWE ALSO DISCUSSED IMPORTANT PROJECTS UNDERWAY WHICH UPGRADE\nTHE ROLE OF OUR COUNTRY IN THE -- ON THE ENERGY MAP, SUCH\nAS THE T.A.P., THE I.G.P., THE UPGRADING OF THE L&G TERMINAL\nAND THE FSRU PLANT IN LUXEMBOURG WHICH IS BEING DESIGNED.\nALSO WE DISCUSSED THE POSSIBILITY OF OPENING NEW\nNATURAL GAS CORRIDORS IN THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN WHICH\nWOULD PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PEACE AND STABILITY IN OUR\nREGION. WE HAVE ALSO DISCUSSED THE\nEXCELLENT GREEK HUMAN POTENTIAL, HUMAN CAPITAL, AND ESPECIALLY\nYOUNG SCIENTISTS. WE HAVE STRESSED THE HUGE\nPOTENTIAL OPENING FROM -- FOR THE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE\nAMERICAN AND THE GREEK BUSINESS COMMUNITIES IN THE FIELDS OF\nINNOVATION AND STARTUP COMPANIES IN GREECE.\nAND WE HAVE ALSO DISCUSSED THE CURRENT REGIONAL DEVELOPMENTS,\nTHE GREAT CHALLENGES IN SECURITY, MIGRATION, THE NEED TO\nSTRENGTHEN OUR COOPERATION ON THESE ISSUES.\nWE HAVE DISCUSSED THE CRITICAL ROLE", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1479223560641.1479220364040.3854d549-b23e-47f4-a6d6-6ae5c0b59e97.segment3.thumb.jpg", "channel": "202"}, {"start": 555792.0, "length": 199701.0, "end": 755493, "date": 1479234818180, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1479242124466.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1479234803128-262c3335-1e03-483d-8cff-a47dc1228722-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=555.79,755.49", "text": ">>> WHILE PRESIDENT OBAMA'S\nSUCCESSOR PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP WHILE HE SELECTS HIS NEW\nCABINET, PRESIDENT OBAMA IS IN GREECE.\nTHE PRESIDENT A LITTLE WHILING A AMITED HE WAS SURPRISED BY THE\nELECTION RESULTS. >> I STILL DON'T FEEL\nRESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT THE PRESIDENT-ELECT SAYS OR DOES,\nBUT I DO FEEL A RESPONSIBILITY AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES TO MAKE SURE THAT I FACILITATE A GOOD TRANSITION AND\nI PRESENT TO HIM AS WELL AS TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE MY BEST\nTHINKING, MY BEST IDEAS ABOUT HOW YOU MOVE THE COUNTRY\nFORWARD.

WE'RE LISTENING TO INITIAL\nCOMMENTS HERE FROM THE PRIME MINISTER OF GREECE AS THEY BEGIN\nTHIS. THE PRESIDENT WILL END HIS TRIP\nIN PERU AS HE MAKES HIS TRAVELS AND OBVIOUSLY TALKED A LOT ABOUT\nTHE FACT THAT ON HIS PRIOR FOREIGN TRIPS DURING THE\nELECTION HE CLAIMED HE WAS CONSTANTLY ASKED ABOUT THE\nSERIOUSNESS OF THE TRUMP CANDIDACY AND WHAT KIND OF\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WOULD BE IF HE WERE TO TAKE ON THAT ROLE\nAND REPRESENT THE COUNTRY ON THE FOREIGN STAGE.\nI THINK IT IS SAFE TO SAY THAT THE PRESIDENT BELIEVED THAT\nHILLARY CLINTON WOULD BE THE PERSON THAT HE WOULD BE\nPREPARING THESE WORLD LEADERS FOR.\nAND NOW IT IS QUITE THE OPPOSITE.\nHE IS DISCUSSING NO DOUBT WITH FOREIGN LEADERS MEETS WITH, WHAT\nKIND OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WILL BE AND MORE INFORMED AFTER\nSPENDING MINUTES WITH DONALD TRUMP AS THE\nPRESIDENT-ELECT IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND DISCUSSING THE\nROLE OF THE PRESIDENCY AND WHAT IT ENTAILS IN TERMS OF FOREIGN\nAFFAIRS NO DOUBT AS WELL. WE WILL KEEP AN EYE ON THIS.\nWE'LL DIP IN AND LISTEN TO SOME OF THIS WITH THE TRANSLATION\nNOW. >> Translator: KEEPS THE\nEUROPEAN STUCK IN STAGNATION AND THEREFORE BRINGS ABOUT HUGE\nPOLITICAL AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS. AND IN THIS RESPECT I HAD THE\nOPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA THE HUGE\nCHALLENGES THAT OF OUR COUNTRY BUT ALSO THE WHOLE OF EUROPE IS\nDEALING WITH. THESE ARE CHALLENGES THAT NEED\nTO BE DEALT WITH COLLECTIVELY, DECISIVELY AND OTHERWISE WE WILL\nBE LED TO BACKWARDS FROM A POLITICAL AND A SOCIAL POINT OF\nVIEW. , WE HAVE AGREED FOR MODERN\nSOCIETIES TO HAVE HELP AND AGAINST THE INCREASING\nSKEPTICISM AND INWARD LOOKING WHICH IS A THREAT TO MODERN\nDEMOCRACIES. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WHEN\nTRYING TO AVOID HISTORIC MISTAKES OF THE PAST SAW THIS\nISSUE CLEARLY WHEN IN 1953 AND WITH THE ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORTS\nOF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THEY SETTLED THE GERMAN DEBT AND\nTHEY LINKED IT TO A GROWTH CLAUSE.\nTODAY THE STRONG GERMANY, WHICH IS POWERHOUSE OF, FINANCIAL\nPOWERHOUSE OF EUROPE, SHOULD THINK IN THE SAME MANNER.\nGREECE AND THE GREEK PEOPLE HAVE RECENTLY HAD TO DEAL WITH THE\nMOST, THE HARSHEST CONSEQUENCES OF THE GLOBAL AND EUROPEAN\nECONOMIC CRISIS. AS AN ECONOMY AND AS A SOCIETY\nWE HAVE HAD TO EXPERIENCE A PROGRAM OF DISASTEROUS AUSTERITY\nWHICH MADE THE PROBLEMS MORE ACUTE INSTEAD OF RESOLVING THEM.\nWITHIN A FEW YEARS WE HAVE LOST 25% OF OUR GDP WHILE IN 2004\nUNEMPLOYMENT WENT UP TO 27%. TODAY AND DESPITE WHAT WE HAVE\nSUFFERED WE ARE STILL STANDING. WE WERE ABLE THROUGH GREAT\nSACRIFICES TO AVOID THE THREATS AND, THE THREATENED DISASTER AND\nWE ARE STEP BY STEP RESTORING OUR ECONOMY.\nTODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS WE ARE BACK TO GROWTH.\nSLOWLY BUT SURELY -- MARTHA: WE'LL KEEP ONE EAR ON\nTHIS WE WANT TO BRING IN STEVE FORBES WHO JOINED US ON THIS\nSET. STEVE, OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A\nFOREIGN POLICY DISCUSSION BUT WE ALSO WANTED TO DISCUSS TRADE\nWITH YOU AND WHAT YOU THINK THE FUTURE PRESIDENT, DONALD TRUMP,\nWILL TAKE ON. SOME DETAILS HAVE BEEN LEAKING\nOUT THIS MORNING IN TERMS OF THE IMMEDIATE BEGINNING OF THE\nPROCESS IS OF REFORMING NAFTA. ALSO A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT A\nPOSSIBLE CHINA TRADE WAR. YOUR THOUGHTS ON ANY OF THOSE?\n>> WELL, I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IN TERMS OF TRADE, THAT IS\nGOING TO TAKE A LOT OF NEGOTIATING.\nTHAT IS GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF TIME.\nTHERE ARE REMEDIES IN PLACE FOR TRADE ABUSES.\nI THINK YOU WILL START TO SEE A LITTLE MORE AGGRESSIVE APPROACH\nTHERE BUT TWO BIG THINGS WILL HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY\nAND WHY I THINK THE STOCK MARKET HELD UP AND GONE UP, A MAJOR TAX\nOVERHAUL, REDUCING TAX RATES ACROSS THE BOARD AND DRASTICALLY\nREDUCING TAXES ON BUSINESSES. ON THE HEALTH CARE SIDE YOU WILL\nSEE REPEAL OF OBAMACARE, MOST OF IT AND ZOO A MORE PRO-PATIENT\nAPPROACH TAKEN WHICH WILL BE GOOD ESPECIALLY FOR SMALL\nBUSINESSES. THE OTHER DAY DONALD TRUMP\nMENTIONED DOING DERIEGELATION ON BANK LENDING.\nBANK LENDING DECLINED DRASTICALLY LAST COUPLE YEARS\nWHICH IS WHY YOU HAVE SUCH POOR JOB CREATION.\nWHY YOU HAVE SUCH A LOW LABOR PARTICIPATION RATE.\nIN NEXT 100 DAYS OR 100 DAYS OF HIS ADMINISTRATION, YOU WILL SEE\nHUGE MAJOR PUSHES ON TAXES, ON HEALTH CARE, GETTING OUR\nFINANCIAL SYSTEM WORKING AGAIN AND THAT I THINK WILL BE\nEXCELLENT FOR THE ECONOMY. MARTHA: THERE ARE SOME MEMOS\nTHAT ARE LEAKING OUT THIS MORNING THAT TALK ABOUT MANY SO\nOF THE SPECIFICS THAT MAY BE IN THIS PLAN.\nIT INCLUDES BENCHMARKS BROKEN DOWN BY THE TRUMP TRANSITION\nTEAM, BENCHMARK FOR DAY ONE, BENCHMARK FOR DAY 100, BENCHMARK\nFOR DAY 200 OF MARKERS THEY WANT TO MEET.\nCLEARLY YOU TOUCHED ON EXACTLY WHAT IS THE HEART OF THEIR PLAN\nTO RETAIN AND RETURN MANUFACTURING JOBS WHICH DEALS\nRATE AND ELIMINATING REGULATIONS ON BUSINESSES AND RESTRICTIONS.\nI THINK EVEN THE, VICTORY OF DONALD TRUMP HAS LED A NUMBER OF\nCOMPANIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO SAY, YEAH, LET'S MOVE FORWARD\nWITH THAT EXPANSION PLAN. >> I THINK COMPANIES ARE TAKING\nA NEW LOOK. ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK THE\nPRESIDENT WILL DO EVEN ON INAUGURATION DAY ITSELF, SIGN\nEXECUTIVE ORDERS PEELING AWAY A LOT OF OBAMA'S ANTI-GROWTH\nEXECUTIVE ORDERS AND PUSHING OR HAVING A REAL PUSH FOR\nDEREGULATION. REMEMBER WHEN RONALD REAGAN CAME\nIN BACK IN 1981, ON DAY ONE HE TOOK OFF PRICE CONTROLS ON OIL\nAND GAS WHICH CRITICS SAID WOULD LEAD TO A HUGE INCREASE IN\nPRICES. IT LED TO JUST THE OPPOSITE.\nMORE SUPPLY, MORE REASONABLE PRICES AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE\nGREAT BOOM OF THE 1980S. THINK YOU WILL SEE TRUMP TRY TO\nDO THE SAME THING FROM DAY ONE ON THE DEREGULATORY SIDE OF\nTHINGS. MARTHA: YOU KNOW, PRESIDENT\nOBAMA, WHEN HE SPOKE YESTERDAY AT THE NEWS CONFERENCE STUCK UP\nFOR THE REGULATIONS THAT HE HAS IMPLEMENTED OVER THE COURSE OF\nHIS PRESIDENCY. BASICALLY REMOVING CORPORATE\nREGULATIONS WOULD BE A HUGE MISTAKE.\nWE KNOW THAT THIS FUTURE PRESIDENT FEELS VERY, VERY\nDIFFERENTLY ABOUT THAT. >> WELL, YES.\nAND YOU LOOK AT THE SMALL BUSINESSES, THEY'RE GETTING\nCRUSHED BY THESE RULES AND REGULATIONS.\nMANY OF THEM WRITTEN IN LANGUAGE WHICH NO ONE CAN INTERPRET\nEXCEPT A BUREAUCRAT DEPENDING ON HIS OR HER MOOD THAT DAY AND\nTHAT HURTS INVESTMENT. IF YOU GET A PUSH ON\nDEREGULATION, NOT PUNISHING BANKS FOR MAKING LOANS, I THINK\nYOU WILL SEE THE CREDIT MARKETS START TO REVIVE.\nHE WILL PUSH THE FED TO BE LESS ANTI-CREDIT MARKET IN TERMS OF\nPOLICY. SO YOU PUT THAT TOGETHER, AND\nTHE PEOPLE LOOK TO THE FUTURE. IF THEY THINK THERE IS A FUTURE\nTHERE OF REASONABLE TAXATION, REGIME THAT IS NOT ANTI-GROWTH,\nPEOPLE WILL, THE ANIMAL SPIRITS WILL COME BACK AGAIN.\nMARTHA: WHAT ABOUT CHINA, STEVE? THERE IS DISCUSSION OF A 45%\nTARIFF AND SOME PEOPLE POINTING OUT THAT THAT MIGHT SORT OF COME\nBACK TO BITE US. THAT IT WOULD RAISE PRICES OF\nEVERYTHING AT WALMART AS AN EXAMPLE IN\n\"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\" THIS MORNING.\n>> YES. YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT A 45%\nSALES TAX. TARIFFS ARE SALES TAXES.\nYOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT. THERE ARE REMEDIES IN PLACE.\nCHINA, FOR EXAMPLE, HERE AND IN EUROPE AND AROUND THE WORLD IS\nDUMPING STEEL. THE REMEDIES ARE THERE TO DEAL\nWITH THAT. WE HAVE LEGISLATION ON THE\nBOOKS. THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN\nLAGGARD OR MISSING IN ACTION IN TERMS OF THOSE RULES VIOLATIONS.\nYOU CAN DO THINGS WITHIN THE RULES WITHOUT THROWING THE WHOLE\nSYSTEM OUT. SO, YES, YOU CAN TAKE ACTION\nWITHIN THE RULES, MEANINGFUL ACTION ON THINGS THAT THEY\nSHOULDN'T BE DOING. AND CYBERSECURITY, WHICH IS NOT\nSTRAYED IN AND OF ITSELF IS ANOTHER THING THAT IS HURTING\nCOMPANIES WHEN YOU STEAL, WHAT THEY CALL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY,\nTRADE SECRETS AND THE LIKE OF COMPANIES.\nTHAT TOO CAN BE DEALT WITH FROM DAY ONE OF THE MEANS ARE THERE.\nJUST GOT TO USE THEM. MARTHA: SO MUCH ON THE LIST.\nSTEVE FORBES, ECONOMIST, PUBLISHER, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR --\n>> THANK YOU, MARTHA. BILL: GONE THROUGH A LOT TOO,\nTHE COUNTRY OF GREECE WITS OWN ECONOMY AND REFLECTED ACROSS THE\nCONTINENT OF EUROPE. HOW WILL DONALD TRUMP ADDRESS\nISIS? ANOTHER THREAT IN THE\nMIDDLE EAST AND IN EUROPE.

MERCEDES, WE ALL REMEMBER,\nRAPISTS, MURDERERS, DRUG DEALERS, BUT IT TURNED OUT THAT\nTHOSE WORDS DID NOT OVERWHELMINGLY TURN OFF THE\nLATINO VOTE. WHY?\n>> WELL, HISPANICS, FIRST OF ALL ARE NOT MONOLITHIC.\nTHEY UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE AND THE TWO ISSUES ARE CLEARLY\nTHE ECONOMY AND EDUCATION. THOSE ARE TWO ISSUES THAT ARE\nINCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY.\nI THINK THAT OBVIOUSLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE ISSUE OF\nIMMIGRATION, YOU KNOW, IT'S STILL SOMETHING THAT'S VERY\nIMPORTANT FOR THE COMMUNITY, THAT THEY WANT TO SEE RESOLUTION\nIN THE FUTURE, BUT I HAVE TO SAY WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE TRUMP\nTEAM AND REALLY THE RNC, THAT HISPANIC COALITION TEAM LED BY\nJENNY CORN AND HELEN PEREZ, THEY WERE THE ONES WHO WERE ABLE TO\nTALK TO HISPANICS ACROSS IN THE BATTLEGROUND STATES AND HONE IN,\nFOR EXAMPLE, ON REACHING OUT TO HISPANIC EVANGELICALS, A KEY\nCONSTITUENCY IN THE HISPANIC VOTER AS WELL AS IN FLORIDA, ONE\nOF THE KEY CONSTITUENCIES THERE WERE THE CUBAN-AMERICANS WHERE\nYOU HAD OVER 54% VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE MANY OF THEM\nDISAGREED WITH OBAMA'S POSITIONING ON BASICALLY ON CUBA\nPOLL. >> I YOU KNOW, MERCEDES, LET'S\nLOOK AT THE POLLS FOR A SECOND.

I THINK THE MARKET IS NOW GOING\nTO BEGIN TO FOCUS ON DECEMBER 4th REFERENDUM IN ITALY FOR\nREFORM OF THE UPPER HOUSE THERE. A NEGATIVE RESULT AND IT'S\nLOOKING VERY FINELY BALANCED AT THE MOMENT WOULD CLEARLY BE\nNEGATIVE FOR MARKETS. BUT IT'S MUCH MORE IMPORTANT TO\nCONSIDER THE FUNDAMENTALS. WHAT ARE THE COMPANIES\nTHEMSELVES ACTUALLY SAYING BY AND LARGE, COMMENTARY IS\nPOSITIVE. Q3 REPORTING SEASON HAS BEEN\nSTRONG. 38% OF EUROPEAN COMPANIES HAVE\nEXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS BY 5% OR MORE.\n>> GO AHEAD. >> AND ALSO VALUATIONS ARE\nSUPPORTED AS WELL.

THERE'S A LOT OF COMMENTATORS\nOUT THERE CALLING FOR A FALL IN BOND PRICES AND INCREASE IN\nYIELDS. WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT'S NOT\nNEGATIVE FOR EQUITY MARKETS. EQUITY MARKETS GENERALLY TRADE\nPOSITIVELY WHEN WE ARE IN A PERIOD OF TIGHTENING U.S.\nMONETARY POLICY. SO THE OVERALL FRAMEWORK AS WE\nWOULD PERCEIVE IT IS POSITIVE. >> ARE YOU ENCOURAGED BY THE\nGAINS WE'RE SEEING IN U.S. FINANCIALS A LOT OF IT DOWN TO\nTHE RATE ADJUSTMENT WE'RE SEEING BUT HOPES THAT DONALD TRUMP MAY\nHAVE SOME DEREGULATION THAT COULD BE MORE FAVORABLE TO BANK.\n>> BY EXTENSION, YES, IT IS AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE REGULATION IS\nBECOMING LESS SEVERE WHICH SHOULD ALLOW BANKS TO INCREASE\nTHEIR RETURN ON EQUITY WHICH IS QUITE CLEARLY ESSENTIAL FOR\nTHEIR VALUATION. BUT THE MOVE IN BOND YIELDS IS\nDEFINITELY POSITIVE FOR EUROPEAN BANKS AS WELL.\nIT ALLOWS THEM TO EARN HIGHER WHAT WE CALL NET INTEREST\nMARGINS WHICH IS BASICALLY THE SPREAD BETWEEN LENDING AND\nBORROWING FOR BANKS.

DONALD TRUMP WILL BE THE 45th\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND IT WILL BE UP TO HIM TO SET\nUP A TEAM THAT HE THINKS WILL REFLECT HIS POLICIES.\nAND THOSE WHO DIDN'T VOTE FOR HIM HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT\nTHAT'S HOW DEMOCRACY WORKS. THAT'S HOW THIS SYSTEM OPERATES.\n>> WHILE PRESIDENT OBAMA DID NOT DIRECTLY CRITICIZED, BUT URGED\nTHE STAFF TO MAKE SMART DECISIONS AND REACH TIMEOUT TO\nMINORIIES AND WOMEN. >> I DID SAY TO HIM AS I SAID\nPUBLICLY THAT BECAUSE OF THE NATURE AND THE BITTERNESS AND\nFEROCITY OF THE CAMPAIGNS, IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO TRY TO SEND\nSIGNALS OF UNITY.

WHEN YOU THINK BACK EIGHT YEARS\nAGO, GEORGE W. BUSH SAID NOTHING CRITICAL ABOUT BARACK OBAMA AND\nGAVE HIM A LOT OF SPACE. DICK CHENEY WAS CRITICAL OFTEN,\nBUT GEORGE W. BUSH WAS NOT. IT ALLOWED FOR BARACK OBAMA TO\nSORT OF CUT HIS OWN PATH WITHOUT HIS PREDECESSOR CHIRPING OVER\nHIS SHOULDER. IT APPEARS THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA\nIS CONSCIOUS OF A FEW THINGS.

JOBS GROWTH.\nFEWER REGULATIONS AND TAX REFORM.\nTHAT IS THE KEY. >> HE CRITICIZED THE OBAMA\nECONOMY. THE OBAMA ECONOMY IS WIND IN HIS\nSAILS. >> GREG, RUDY GIULIANI IS THE\nLEAD FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT\nPOSSIBILITY? >> I THINK HE WOULD BE AN\nINCREDIBLE LIGHTNING ROD AT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.\nSECRETARY OF STATE, LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE TRUMP DOES, HE\nWILL PREVAIL.

KNOWN TO BE VERY GOOD WITH A\nKNIFE. NO, YOU WANT TO DISPEL THIS\nNOTION, I AM SURE. TELL US WHY YOU DON'T BELIEVE\nTHERE'S ANY KNIFE FIGHT GOING ON WITHIN THE TRANSITION.\n>> WELL, BECAUSE THERE IS NOT. AND CHRIS, I THINK IT'S SO\nIMPORTANT TO REALIZE THIS NEW TRANSITION TEAM AND NEW PR\nPROSPECTIVE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN IN PLACE NOW FOR NOT EVEN A\nWEEK. WE'RE ONE WEEK PAST THE\nELECTION. THEY'RE IN THE PROCESS OF\nEVERYTHING STANDING UP, AND THERE ARE GOING TO BE WONDERFUL,\nROBUST CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE TYPE OF PEOPLE AND THE TYPE OF\nSKILL SETS NEEDED AT DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS IN ORDER TO GET\nTHESE DEPARTMENTS FUNCTIONING AND WORKING AND RIGHT SIZING\nAGAIN. THOSE ARE GOING TO BE\nPRIORITIES. WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS MATCH THE\nSKILL SET TO THE NEEDS OF THE DEPARTMENT.\nTHAT MEANS YOU NEED TO HAVE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE GOOD AT\nANALYSIS AND DEFINING PROBLEMS. YOU NEED TO HAVE INDIVIDUALS\nTHAT ARE GOOD AT EXECUTION AND ARE CHANGE AGENTS.\nTHEN YOU'RE GOING TO NEED THOSE THAT CAN MAINTAIN THE EXISTING.\nBUT I THINK IT IS A LITTLE OVER THE TOP.\nJUST LIKE SOME OF THE PROGNOSTICATING WAS A LITTLE\nOVER THE TOP, TO SAY THERE'S ANY TYPE OF KNIFE FIGHT GOING ON.\n>> ALL ERRORS ARE NOT EQUAL.

YOU KNOW, CHRIS, ONE OF THE MOST\nFRUITFUL THINGS THAT WE PARTICIPATED IN THIS FALL WAS ON\nCONSTITUTION DAY, DOING GOOGLE HANGOUTS WITH OUR HIGH SCHOOLS\nAND DOING THE EDUCATION ON THE CONSTITUTION AND THE\nRESPONSIBILITY OF THE AMERICAN VOTER TO THE CONSTITUTION AND TO\nTHE UNION OF THESE 50 STATES. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT TYPE\nACTIVITY COMING FROM YOU ALL. DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO HAVE A\nVERY SUCCESSFUL ADMINISTRATION. DONALD TRUMP AND HIS TEAM ARE\nGOING ABOUT PUTTING THIS ADMINISTRATION TOGETHER THE\nRIGHT WAY. THEY'RE ASSESSING THE SITUATION,\nDEFINING THE PROBLEMS, GETTING THE RIGHT PERSON IN THE RIGHT\nQUEUE.

RUDY GIULIANI.\nTHERE WAS SOME TALK HE MIGHT BE ATTORNEY GENERAL.\nNOW HE SAYS HE'S NOT. CAN YOU THINK OF A BETTER CHOICE\nTHAN RUDY GIULIANI FOR SECRETARY OF STATE?\n>> THAT IS GOING TO BE MR. TRUMP'S DECISION.\nTHERE ARE SOME VERY WELL-QUALIFIED PEOPLE WHO HAVE\nSTEPPED UP TO LEND THEIR NAME FOR CONSIDERATION FOR VARIOUS\nPOSITIONS. I THINK IT IS FABULOUS THAT\nWE'RE HEARING FROM FORMER MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE AND THE\nSENATE AND FORMER ADMINISTRATIONS WHO THINK THAT\nAND WANT TO BE CONSIDERED AND SEE IF THEIR SKILL SET IS RIGHT\nFOR SOLVING THESE PROBLEMS. AND THAT IS A CREDIT TO MR.\nTRUMP AND THE WAY HE CARRIED FORTH HIS CAMPAIGN AND THE WAY\nHE AND HIS TEAM ARE ENTERING INTO THIS TRANSITION.\n>> RIGHT. IT'S CERTAINLY THE PRESIDENT'S\nCHOICE. NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.\nYOU SAID YOU ALWAYS TELL YOUR CONSTITUENTS, YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE\nMY DECISIONS, BUT YOU ALWAYS KNOW WHERE I STAND.\nI'M ASKING YOU, CAN YOU THINK OF SOMEBODY WHO'S BETTER THAN RUDY\nGIULIANI? >> I THINK THAT THERE ARE\nSEVERAL PEOPLE WHO ARE EQUALLY QUALIFIED AND WOULD DO A GREAT\nJOB. RUDY GIULIANI WOULD SEND A\nPOWERFUL MESSAGE AND WOULD DO A WONDERFUL JOB EITHER AS\nSECRETARY OF STATE OR WHATEVER POSITION HE CHOSE TO TAKE OR\nWHATEVER ADVICE HE GIVES. HE'S VERY THOROUGH.\nHE'S VERY MEASURED. HE IS VERY COLLECTED AS HE MAKES\nA DECISION. HE DOES A GOOD JOB OF GOING\nTHROUGH THOSE STEPS I JUST ARTICULATED, DEFINING THOSE\nPROBLEMS AND DECIDING WHAT IS GOING TO BE THE BEST WAY TO\nADDRESS THEM. RUDY GIULIANI ALSO UNDERSTANDS\nTHAT YOU LEAD PEOPLE, YOU MANAGE ASSETS.\nAND THERE'S A DIFFERENCE AS YOU GO ABOUT BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS\nAROUND THE GLOBE AND WITHIN THE COUNTRY IN ORDER TO HELP LEAD\nTHIS NATION. THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT\nUNDERSTANDING FOR INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE.\n>> REPRESENTATIVE MARSHA BLACKBURN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH\nFOR GIVING US PERSPECTIVE FROM INSIDE THE TRUMP TRANSITION.\n>> ALWAYS GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.

TRUMP IN GREECE, DONALD\nTRUMP IS TWEETING THIS MORNING. JUST ABOUT A HALF HOUR.\nHE TWEETED THIS. ALL STATES FOR THE CAMPAIGN.\nHERE'S ANOTHER ONE A LITTLE BIT LONGER AGO.\nTOTAL POPULAR VOTE I WOULD HAVE CAMPAIGNED IN NEW YORK, FLORIDA,\nAND CALIFORNIA. HE'S TWEETING THAT AS THESE\nPROTESTS COME ACROSS THIS MORNING.\n>> WELL, THAT BUT ALSO HE'S TWEETING THIS AS THE DAY AFTER,\nTWO DAYS AFTER MITT ROMNEY LOST IN 2012.\nHE REAMED. >> I'M NOT GOING TO CHANGE MY\nOPINION JUST BECAUSE I WON. I DON'T THINK I'M GOING OUT ON A\nVERY FAR LIMB. OUR PRESIDENT-ELECT IS PROBABLY\nWATCHING THE NEWS, READING, SEEING THAT THE PROTESTS ARE\nGOING ON AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE DEMOCRATS ARE SAYING, WHAT\nHE HAD SAID. ABOUT THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE.\nHAVING SAID THAT, THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS SOMETHING THAT IS\nGOING TO BE VERY, VERY DIFFICULT TO CHANGE AND THE DEMOCRATS WHO\nARE SAYING THAT THEY WANT TO CHANGE IT PROBABLY SHOULD\nREMEMBER THAT THEY HAD A HUGE ELECTORAL COLLEGE ADVANTAGE\nGOING INTO TUESDAY NIGHT. AND THEY BLEW IT.\nTHEY BLEW IT. THEY BLEW IT.\nTHEY LOST THE BLUE STATES OF MICHIGAN AND WISCONSIN AND\nPENNSYLVANIA, STATES THAT HAD BEEN BLUE SINCE THE '80s.\nBECAUSE THEY LOST THEIR VOTERS TO DONALD TRUMP.\n>> CAN'T ARGUE THAT. THAT'S STILL TRUE.\nALL OF THESE PROTESTS ARE GOING ON ACROSS THE COUNTRY.\nTHEY DON'T SEEM TO BE STOPPING. THERE'S ANOTHER BIG ONE PLANNED\nIN NEW YORK CITY TODAY. THERE'S A CHANGE.ORG PETITION\nGOING AROUND WITH 4 MILLION SIGNATURES FROM PEOPLE WHO WANT\nTO CHANGE THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE SYSTEM TO THE POPULAR VOTE\nSYSTEM. IT'S TIME TO REUNITE THE\nCOUNTRY. DO THE TWEETS HELP?\n>> OF COURSE NOT. DONALD TRUMP, WE SHOULD ALL\nSTART GETTING USED TO THIS, WE SAW IT QUITE A BIT DURING THE\nCAMPAIGN SEASON, MAYBE THE PUBLIC HASN'T REALLY SORT OF\nFIGURED THIS OUT YET, BUT DONALD TRUMP'S OPINION ABOUT A LOT OF\nTHINGS DEPENDS ON WHETHER OR NOT IT'S DONALD TRUMP.\nTHE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS AN ABOMONATION, THAT'S WHAT IT'S\nBEHIND THE POLLS IS ALL ABOUT. NOW THE SYSTEM UNRIGGED ITSELF\nSINCE HE WON. THEY'RE GOING DOWN THAT SAME\nPATH AND TAKING THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT.\nBUT THINK MORE SERIOUSLY ABOUT WHAT THEY REALLY WANT AND WHAT\nTHEY REALLY WANT TO DO. I MEAN, THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF\nBEING SHOUTED OUT THERE ON THOSE PROTEST LINES AND A LOT OF IT\nHAS TO DO WITH HIS PAST STATEMENTS, A LOT OF IT HAS TO\nDO WITH SOME OF THE ADVISORS HE'S GOT AROUND IT.\nA LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH THE POLICIES, ESPECIALLY THINGS LIKE\nTHE IMMIGRATION POLICIES. YOU KNOW, FOLKS ARE GOING TO\nHAVE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT -- THEY CAN SHOUT IT ON THE STREETS\nEVERY DAY FROM NOW UNTIL THE END OF HIS FIRST TERM BUT YOU'RE\nGOING TO HAVE TO AT SOME POINT FIGURE OUT WHICH POLICIES ARE\nMOST IMPORTANT, PRIORITIZE THOSE AND --\n>> WHAT EXACTLY YOU WANT. SO, NANCY, DO YOU ENVISION\nTRUMP'S FOREIGN POLICY BEING PARTLY WORKED OUT VIA TWEETS?\n>> ABSOLUTELY. I THINK DONALD TRUMP IS WHO HE\nIS. .\nWE'RE GOING TO SEE LOTS OF TWEETS AND DIPLOMATS ARE GOING\nTO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE IT. THE SIMPLE TRUTH IS WE HAVE NO\nIDEA WHAT HIS POLICIES ARE GOING TO BE BECAUSE HE DOESN'T KNOW IT\nYET. WHETHER IT'S IDOLOGUES WILL\nPROVE WHERE HIS THOUGHTS ARE. IF YOU LOOK AT GEORGE BUSH'S\nFIRST 9 MONTHS PRE-9/11. HE HADN'T THOUGHT OF THIS.\nHE TRIED TO PUSH A VERY ANTI-U.N., ANTI-THE WORLD,\nISOLATIONIST. WE'RE THE LONE SUPER POWER, WE\nCAN RULE THE WORLD. IT FRANKLY BLEW UP IN HIS FACE.\nI THINK DONALD TRUMP WILL GO THROUGH THE EDUCATION OF DONALD\nTRUMP HITTING REALITY AND YOU'LL SEE A SHIFT IN THE FIRST YEAR OR\nTWO AS THEY WORK THAT OUT UNLESS THEY GET IT RIGHT FROM THE START\nWHICH IS UNLIKELY BUT -- >> WELL, IN LIGHT OF THAT LET'S\nTALK ABOUT HIS POSSIBLE PICKS. ONE IS RUDY GIULIANI AND THE\nOTHER IS JOHN BOLTON. THE FORMER U.N. AMBASSADOR TO\nTHE UNITED NATIONS. HE HAS CALLED FOR THE BOMBING OF\nIRAN AND FIERCELY ANTI-RUSSIAN. >> VERY MUCH SO.\nHE IS THE ULTIMATE NEOCON. HE WAS THE AMBASSADOR TO THE\nU.N. UNDER GEORGE W. BUSH AND HE IS VERY, VERY HAWKISH WITH\nREGARD TO THOSE COUNTRIES THAT YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT AND\nOTHERS. RUDY GIULIANI IS A VERY\nDIFFERENT KIND OF GUY AND JUST IN TERMS OF THE LIKELIHOOD, I\nWAS TOLD BY SOMEBODY WHO IS FAMILIAR WITH THIS PROCESS THAT\nWHAT RUDY GIULIANI WANTS RUDY GIULIANI IS GOING TO GET.\nHE WAS THAT LOYAL EVEN IN DONALD TRUMP'S DARKEST DAYS SO IT SEEMS\nTO ME THAT HE'S MORE LIKELY GOING TO BE THE SECRETARY OF\nSTATE IF THAT IS, IN FACT, WHAT HE WANTS IN THE END.\n>> LET'S FOCUS ON THAT THEN. IS HE GOING TO BE SECRETARY OF\nSTATE? HE WAS AN ATTORNEY GENERAL.\nHE WAS THE MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY.\n>> HE IS PART OF A VERY CONTROVERSIAL POLICY THAT YOU'LL\nPROBABLY HEAR FROM PROTESTORS AT SOME POINT ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT\nPEOPLE WHO WERE FLEEING THE DICTATORSHIP IN HAITI, SEEMS\nLIKE ANCIENT HISTORY. THEY HAVE THE POLICY OF GETTING\nSENT BACK, NOT TREATING THEM LIKE REFUGEES, TREATING THEM\nLIKE ECONOMIC REFUGEES WHO HAD TO BE RETURNED RATHER THAN\nPOLITICAL REFUGEES. HE WAS UP TO HIS EYEBALLS IN\nINTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS IN THE '80s.\n>> I'M NOT SURE IF THERE IS GOING TO BE PORTRAYED BY THE\nPEOPLE WHO NEED TO CONFIRM HIM. SINCE HE'S BEEN OUT OF OFFICE\nHIS WORK HAS TAKEN HIM AROUND THE GLOBE.\nNOT DIPLOMACY. >> SO, NANCY, YOUR THOUGHTS ON\nTHAT? IF HE'S THE MOST LIKELY CHOICE\nFOR SECRETARY OF STATE, WHAT TYPE OF SECRETARY OF STATE WILL\nHE BE? >> HE'LL BE BRASH.\nI DON'T THINK HE KNOWS. HE DOES HAVE EXPERIENCE.\nHE'S TRAVELED AROUND THE WORLD. A PRESIDENT HAS TO BALANCE\nEVERYTHING. WHO WILL BE HIS SECRETARY OF\nSTATE, U.S./U.N. AMBASSADOR. IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW ALL OF THIS\nIS GOING TO BALANCE OUT. YOU'VE GOT TO DO IT AS A WHOLE\nTEAM. THE WORLD TENDS TO BE A SOBERING\nREALITY. IT'S NOT A ZERO SUM GAME LIKE\nBUSINESSES. IT'S IN OUR INTERESTS.\nTHE DOMESTIC POLICY. I'M ACTUALLY LESS CONCERNED\nWHICH IS CONTRARY TO IT. BECAUSE WE ARE A SUPER POWER BUT\nWE DON'T RUN THE WORLD BUT WE LEAD THE WORLD.\nWE CAN'T LEAD JUST OURSELVES. WE WILL FIND WE NEED TO HAVE\nPEOPLE WITH US. WE WANT TO FIND OUT EXACTLY\nWHICH SIDE OF HIS GOALS PRESIDENT PUTIN IS ON.\n>> MR. PUTIN VERY QUICKLY REACHED OUT TO DONALD TRUMP.\nTHEY HAD A VERY CORDIAL CONVERSATION.\n>> RIGHT. THEY'RE EXPLORING THE ARCTIC.\n>> JUST ABOUT A MINUTE AND A HALF PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL TALK\nFROM GREECE. THEY'LL HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP INTO THE MIX. WHAT DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT\nWILL SAY? >> WELL, CONSIDERING HOW\nRESTRAINED HE WAS ON DOMESTIC SOIL YESTERDAY -- I CAN'T\nMANUAL. IMAGINE. >>.\n>> I'D BE SURPRISED ON THAT NOW. THE NEXT PRESIDENT HAS TO CHARGE\nHIS OWN COURT. >> THEY KNOW IT.\n>> THEY'RE WORRIED. WE ALL TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD\nAND TALK TO PEOPLE AND BEFORE THE ELECTION THEY WERE BEGGING\nUS THAT THIS WOULDN'T COME TRUE. NOW THAT IT HAS COME TRUE\nTHEY'RE HOLDING THEIR BREATH. TALKING TO THE WHITE HOUSE FOLKS\nOVER THE LAST WEEK OR SO, THE TRUMP PEOPLE HAVE REACHED OUT\nAND SAID DON'T DO ANYTHING BIG AND BOLD.\nI MEAN, OBAMA HAD A FAIRLY AGGRESSIVE AGENDA FOR HIS LAST\nTHREE MONTHS IN OFFICE. HE CAN'T REALLY DO MUCH ANYMORE\nBECAUSE THE TRUMP PEOPLE COULD UNDO IT RIGHT AWAY AND HE WANTS\nTO HAVE A SMOOTH TRANSITION. SO THE WORLD'S ON EDGE ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP, NO QUESTION. THEY READ THE TWEETS.\nTHEY'VE WATCHED WHAT HE SAYS. THEY'RE NERVOUS ABOUT IT,\nPARTICULARLY MEXICO, OUR TRADING PARTNERS.\nEUROPE IS ALWAYS AFRAID THE U.S. IS GOING TO WITHDRAW.\nNATO PARTNERS. REALITY HAS A VERY HEALTHY WAY\nOF BRINGING ANY OF THOSE RHETORICS DOWN TO EARTH,\nRHETORICAL COMMENTS. THEY'LL BE REASSURED BY OBAMA,\nBUT FRANKLY THEY'RE GOING TO WAIT AND SEE WHAT DONALD TRUMP\nDOES DURING THE TRANSITION. SO FAR HE'S SENDING REASSURING\nSIGNALS THAT HE'S THINKING ABOUT THINGS, BUT THIS IS A PRESIDENT\nWHO IS FUNDAMENTALLY UNPREPARED TO TAKE ON THESE ISSUES AND HE'S\nGOT A LOT OF HOMEWORK OVER THE TRANSITION.\nTHE PEOPLE HE PUTS IN PLACE ARE GOING TO SEND VERY IMPORTANT\nSIG SIGNALS.\nSO THOSE OF US WHO CARE ABOUT THE FOREIGN POLICY RELATIONSHIPS\nHOPE HE PUTS LONG STANDING PROFESSIONALS IN THERE WHO HE\nCAN TRUST WHO WILL REASSURE THE WORLD.\nHE COULD GO THE OTHER WAY. WE JUST DON'T KNOW.\nIT'S GOING TO BE A RIVETING TRANSITION FOR THE NEXT COUPLE\nOF MONTHS. >> I'M GOING TO TAKE A QUICK\nBREAK. HOPEFULLY WHEN I COME BACK THE\nPRESIDENT AND THE GREEK PRESIDENT WILL BE OUT THERE\nSPEAKING. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. \u00e2\u0099\u00aa\u00e2\u0099\u00aa", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1479223407461.1479220364040.3854d549-b23e-47f4-a6d6-6ae5c0b59e97.segment1.thumb.jpg", "channel": "202"}, {"start": 685089, "length": 15448.0, "end": 700537, "date": 1479233017692, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1479235948258.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1479233003356-25e3de1e-133d-4278-ac55-59a808b01f39-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=685.09,700.54", "text": "PATTI, DOUG, THANK YOU SO MUCH.\n>>> UP NEXT, LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.\nDONALD TRUMP IS ABOUT TO BECOME LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD.\nHE CAN'T DO IT ALONE, THOUGH.

THAT EFFECTIVELY, WE'RE GOING TO\nSEE ALL SORTS OF NEW POLICIES. IS THERE ANY DIVIDE OR\nDISTINCTION, YOU THINK, THAT'S GOING TO TAKE PLACE WITHIN THE\nPARTY ITSELF OVER SOME OF THESE ISSUES TRUMP HAS RAISED?\n>> I THINK THERE WILL BE. THERE'LL BE A VERY ROBUST DEBATE\nPARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF TRADE.\nBECAUSE DONALD TRUMP HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE WANTS TO HAVE A\nTOUGHER NEGOTIATING POSTURE WITH SOME OF OUR TRADING PARTNERS.\nI THINK TRADE WILL BE A HOT TOPIC OF DISCUSSION IN SOME\nDISAGREEMENT. WHILE WE AGREE WITH TOUGH\nPOLICY, TRADE IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR STATES IN TERMS OF\nAGRICULTURE, MANUFACTURING, RETAIL.\nAND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FLOW OF COMMERCE CONTINUES\nAND IT WILL UNDER A TRUMP PRESIDENCY.\nTHERE'S REALLY BROAD UNITY ABOUT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THAT\nNEEDS TO BE UNDONE. SO WE'LL SEE EXACTLY THE STEPS\nAND THE TRANSITION. >> WHAT ABOUT IMMIGRATION?\n>> WELL, YES, THAT'S ANOTHER AREA OF DEBATE.\nCLEARLY WE SUPPORT A VERY SECURE BORDER.\nAN IMMIGRATION POLICY THAT MAKES SENSE.\nI THINK YOU'LL SEE SOME OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT PRESIDENT\nOBAMA HAD IN PLACE BE UNDONE. THAT WAY YOU'LL HAVE A DEBATE\nABOUT IMMIGRATION WITHIN THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS WHERE IT\nSHOULD BE. AND THERE'S GOING TO BE -- IT'S\nGOING TO BE A TOUGH ITEM. BUT YOU FIRST START WITH\nSECURING THE BORDER WHICH WE'RE IN FULL AGREEMENT ON.\nAND ONCE THAT'S DONE, PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP INDICATES\nTHEN WE'LL DECIDE WHERE TO GO FROM THERE.\n>> BUT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT THE WALL A FRIGHTENING TO YOU.\nDO YOU THINK A WALL IS REALLY GOING TO COME?\n>> WELL, YOU'VE GOT TO LISTEN TO THE WORDS OF PRESIDENT-ELECT\nTRUMP. HE TALKED ABOUT YOU MIGHT SEE\nFENCES IN SOME PLACES. YOU'RE GOING HAVE SOME PRACTICAL\nREALITIES. I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME ALONG\nTHE BORDER. YOU'VE GOT SOME VERY SENSITIVE\nAREAS THERE. YOU'VE GOT AREAS THAT A PHYSICAL\nWALL MIGHT NOT MAKE SENSE. SO HE'S GOING TO HOPEFULLY TRY\nTO MAKE SENSE OUT OF A MORE SECURE BORDER.\nTHAT'S WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE EXPECT.\nMUCH OF IT WILL BE A WALL, BUT THERE WILL BE OTHER ASPECTS OF\nIT. >> HE WANTED A PROSECUTOR TO\nLOOK AT HILLARY CLINTON. YOU'VE HEARD LOTS OF PEOPLE AT\nTHE RALLIES TALK ABOUT THAT. YET ON \"60 MINUTES\" THIS WEEK HE\nWALKED THAT BACK AT LEAST TO A DEGREE SAYING HE DIDN'T WANT TO\nHURT THE CLINTONS. WHAT DO YOU THINK IS REALLY\nGOING TO HAPPEN HERE AND WHAT SHOULD HE DO?\n>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A NEW ATTORNEY\nGENERAL THAT'S APPOINTED THAT CAN ACTUALLY MEET WITH THE FBI\nAND REVIEW WHERE THAT MATTER IS. OF COURSE THE FBI INDICATED\nTHEY'RE NOT PROCEEDING FORWARD AT THIS TIME.\nBUT THERE COULD BE OTHER ASPECTS OF THE MATTER THAT HAS TO BE\nLOOKED INTO. BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE SEASONED\nINVESTIGATORS AND PROSECUTORS THAT ARE CAREER OUTSIDE OF THE\nARENA OF POLITICS THAT MAKE DECISIONS.\nTHAT SHOULD BE UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE NEXT ATTORNEY\nGENERAL. THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU\nCAN SAY IN A CAMPAIGN. YOU CAN STATE YOUR OPINION.\nBUT WHATEVER YOUR PRESIDENT OR ATTORNEY GENERAL, THEN YOU LOOK\nAT FACTS, YOU LOOK AT EVIDENCE, YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S THE RIGHT\nTHING TO DO IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL THE CASES AND THE LAW.\n>> GOVERNOR, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE CHOICE OF STEVE BANNON TO\nBE THE PRESIDENT'S SENIOR COUNSELOR?\nI'M LOOKING AT A HEAD LINE HERE. A HARD RIGHT ADVISER.\nBANNAN ACCUSED OF A RACIST VIEWPOINT.\n>> FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T KNOW STEVE BANNON.\nBUT I DO KNOW REINCE PRIEBUS. AND I WAS DELIGHTED THAT\nPRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP SELECTED HIM AS CHIEF OF STAFF.\nSO EACH DECISION THAT I SEE DONALD TRUMP MAKE, I'VE AGREED\nWITH IT. I THINK THAT WAS A VERY GOOD\nCHOICE. THIS IS THE PERSON THAT WILL BE\nA MEMBER OF THE PRESIDENT'S CABINET, HIS CLOSEST ADVISER.\nTHAT'S WHAT THE CONCENTRATION SHOULD BE ON.\nI'M SURE THAT MR. BANNAN BRINGS SOMETHING TO THE TABLE AND\nDONALD TRUMP HAS SOME CONFIDENCE IN HIM AS A SENIOR ADVISER.\nLET'S SEE WHERE THAT GOES. THAT DECISION IS GOOD.\n>> GET RIGHT BACK UP ON THAT HORSE.\nRIGHT? >> THERE ARE WORTHY QUESTIONS TO\nBE ASKED AND I'LL ASK ANOTHER IN THAT SAME VAIN ABOUT THE TRUMP\nEMPIRE MAY ULTIMATELY PRESENT TO THE PRESIDENCY.\nWHAT KIND OF DISCLOSURE DO YOU THINK SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO THE\nAMERICAN PUBLIC ABOUT THE TRUMP BUSINESSES AS THEY GO FORWARD?\nTHERE HAVE BEEN QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER YOU'RE A LOBBYIST,\nYOU'RE GOING TO STAY AT ALL FOREIGN HOTELS.\nYOU'RE GOING TO THROW MORE PARTIES AT MAR-A-LAGO.\nIN TERMS OF FLOWING INTO THAT FAMILY AND BUSINESS WHILE HE'S\nIN THE WHITE HOUSE. >> THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A\nTRADITION AND MANY INSTANCES OF PRESIDENTS PUTTING ASSETS IN\nBLIND TRUSTS. THAT WAY YOU HAVE SOME\nSEPARATION AND YOU DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE WITH THE\nTRUST. IT'S A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT\nWITH THE TRUMP EMPIRE. BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT SIGNS\nEVERYWHERE. YOU SORT OF KNOW WHAT'S\nHAPPENING. SO I THINK THIS REALLY NEEDS TO\nBE THOUGHT THROUGH ON HOW TO ASSURE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC\nTHERE'S GOING TO BE A SEPARATION BETWEEN THE BUSINESS OF THE\nWHITE HOUSE AND THE BUSINESS OPERATED BY THE FAMILY.\nSO HE'S GOT TO THINK THAT THROUGH, GIVE CONFIDENCE IN IT.\nTHERE SHOULD BE A CLEAR LINE OF SEPARATION.\n>> A LOT OF TIMES YOU'LL SAY SOMEBODY'S GOING TO PLAY DEVIL'S\nADVOCATE HERE. BUT NOT NORMALLY -- JUST IN\nCERTAIN CASES AND NOT -- THAT'S NOT DEVIL'S ADVOCATE THAT TIME.\nOTHER TIMES YOU'RE ASKING THE SAME LEGITIMATE QUESTIONS, YOU\nMIGHT USE THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE.

IF SO LONG AS THE PRO-BUSINESS\nTONE CONTINUES. >> HAVE YOU BEEN SURPRISED BY\nTHE REACTION, THOUGH, TO SOME OF THE TECH COMPANIES?\nTHE APPLES OF THE WORLD, THE AMAZONS OF THE WORLD.\n>> RIGHT. SO I THINK THE ISSUE AT HAND OF\nCOURSE IS TRADE. AND I THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO\nHAVE TO SEE HOW THAT PLAYS OUT OVER THE NEXT HUNDRED DAYS AS\nTHEY PUT TOGETHER THEIR PLAN IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT THE\nTRADE SITUATION REMAINS POSITIVE FOR THE TECHNOLOGY COMPANY.\n>> YOU THINK THAT'S OVERHANGING MORE SO?\nI THINK THE BENEFIT WOULD BE BEEN THE REPATRIATED CASH THAT\nCOULD COME BACK. >> THERE'S A HUGE BENEFIT FOR\nTHAT. MAY TAKING A MORE OF A WAIT AND\nSEE TO THAT. A BENEFIT TO A LOT OF LARGE\nTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES AS WELL AS OTHER COMPANIES LISTED ON NASDAQ\nCOULD BENEFIT FROM THAT. >> HAVE WE SEEN A PICKUP IN\nTRADING VOLUMES? IS THERE MORE CERTAINTY NOW SO\nPEOPLE ARE MORE ENGAGED IN THE MARKETS ESPECIALLY WITH ALL\nVOTES RISING EXCEPT FOR BY CAP EX-STOCKS.\n>> WE'VE SEEN A PICKUP IN VOLATILITY PARTICULARLY IN THE\nFIXED INCOME WORLD. YES, IT'S BEEN A GOOD WEEK FOR\nTHOSE OF US IN THAT. >> POWERFUL RALLY IN FINANCIALS.\nI KNOW THAT STOCK PRICES ARE THINGS FORCEOs AND FUTURE CEOs\nTO COMMENT ON. IF YOU LOOK AT OTHER PUBLICLY\nTRADED EXCHANGES. THEY'VE SEEN A RISE IN STOCK\nPRICE. 5%.\n9%. THE NASDAQ IS FLAT ON THE WEEK\nSINCE THE ELECTION. I'M CURIOUS WHAT YOUR TAKE IS ON\nTHAT. WHAT ARE INVESTORS MISSING, IF\nTHEY'RE MISSING SOMETHING? >> WELL, THEY'RE ALWAYS MISSING\nSOMETHING BECAUSE A STOCK CAN ALWAYS GO HIGHER.\nBUT CERTAINLY WE'VE HAD A GREAT RUN.\nWE'RE UP DRAMATICALLY. WE'RE DRAMATICALLY OUT\nPERFORMING. WE LOOK AT THE YEAR TO DATE\nPERFORMANCE. WE CONTINUE TO EXECUTE.\nUNDER ADENA'S LEADERSHIP I THINK WE'LL DO THAT INCREDIBLY WELL.\n>> WHAT'S YOUR OUTLOOK FOR IPOs? >> OBVIOUSLY THIS YEAR HAS BEEN\nA SLOWER YEAR, BUT NASDAQ IN TERMS OF OUR RELATIVE POSITION\nHAS HAD A REALLY STRONG YEAR. WE'VE HAD ABOUT A 74% WIN RATE\nTHIS YEAR. AS WE LOOK, WE SEE A LOT OF\nCOMPANIES WANTING TO GO PUBLIC. I THINK THE EARLIER VOLATILITY\nIN THE YEAR HELD PEOPLE BACK. AND OF COURSE THE ELECTION ALSO\nHOLDS PEOPLE BACK FROM ENTERING THE MARKETS.\nSO WE SEE THE POTENTIAL FOR A BUSY END OF THE YEAR.\nAND THEN GOING INTO Q1 OF NEXT YEAR, THERE'S A VERY HEALTHY\nPIPELINE OF COMPANIES READY TO GO PUBLIC.\n>> THE QUESTION I WAS GOING TO ASK IS, DONALD TRUMP WILL GET\nINTO OFFICE TOWARDS THE END OF JANUARY.\nIN TERMS OF THE TIMING FOR SOME OF THESE IPOs, IS THERE A WATCH\nAND WAIT KIND OF THING IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A FIRST GO.\n>> GENERALLY THE ATTITUDE IS IT'S ALL A MATTER OF THE MARKET\nENVIRONMENT AROUND THEM. I CAN'T PREDICT WHAT THE WORLD\nIS GOING TO LOOK LIKE EXACTLY IN JANUARY.\nBUT GENERALLY SPEAKING, THEY DO TRY TO GO OUT ON THE ROAD AS\nEARLY AS THE SECOND WEEK OF JANUARY AND START THAT PROCESS.\nAND I THINK THAT THEY'RE JUST GOING TO BE LOOKING AT IT AND\nSAYING DO THEY KNOW AS MUCH AS THEY NEED TO KNOW ABOUT HAVING A\nNEW ADMINISTRATION WORK. IF THEY DO, THEN THEY CAN GO OUT\nAND INVESTORS WILL BE RECEPTIVE. >> THE BIG FIGHT FOR IPO IN 2017\nIS GOING TO BE UBER. IS THAT RIGHT?\n>> WE HAVE NO COMMENT ON THAT. THAT'S FOR UBER TO SAY.\nYOU'RE TELLING US SOMETHING WE DON'T KNOW.\n>> THEY'RE GOING TO GO PUBLIC IN 2017.\nI IMAGINE IF YOU'RE IN THE EXCHANGE BUSINESS, THIS IS THE\nONE TO TRY TO GRAB, RIGHT? >> I WOULD SAY WE LOOK AT EVERY\nCOMPANY THAT WANTS TO GO PUBLIC AND WE'RE REALLY EXCITED TO WORK\nWITH THEM. >> HOW EARLY DOES THE STAGE\nBEGIN? SOMETIMES WE FIND OUT FROM THE\nFILING. >> THAT'S WHY WE STARTED NASDAQ\nPRIVATE MARKET. JUST BECAUSE YOU STAY PRIVATE,\nYOU STILL NEED TO HAVE LIQUIDITY.\nTHAT ALSO ALLOWS US TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THESE\nCOMPANIES YEARS BEFORE THINKING OF GOING PUBLIC.\n>> BOB, WHAT'S YOUR ROLE IN ALL THIS GOING TO BE GOING FORWARD?\n>> WELL, FIRST WE'RE FOCUSED ON THE TRANSITION.\nBEEN WORKING ON IT FOR A LONG TIME NOW.\nWE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE PERFECT IT AT THE END.\nTHAT I'LL ASSUME THE ROLE OF CHAIRMAN, BUT ADENA IS THE CEO\nAS OF JANUARY THE 1st. AND AS I SAID, THE TEAM IS IN\nPLACE. I FEEL VERY GOOD ABOUT THE\nFUTURE. >> WOULD YOU EVER FIND A WAY\nINTO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION? >> I'M FOCUSED ON THIS\nTRANSITION AND MAKING SURE THIS GOES WELL.\nAND WE'VE HAD A VERY ACTIVE JOB HERE AT NASDAQ.\nLOOKING FORWARD TO DOING A MULTITUDE OF OTHER THINGS.\n>> FAIR ENOUGH. >> LOOKING OUT, ADENA IN TERMS\nOF NASDAQ'S FUTURE, ARE YOU PRIME TO MEET MORE ACQUISITIONS\nIN THE FIRST HALF OF 2016, ARE THERE MORE TO COME?\n>> WE HAVE DONE I THINK A GREAT JOB OF BALANCING OUT\nACQUISITIONS AND ORGANIC GROWTH OVER MANY YEARS THAT WE WORKED\nTOGETHER. I EXPECT WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO\nTHAT. I THINK WE HAVE AN AMAZING\nOFFERING THAT WE CAN OFFER OUT TO OUR CLIENTS TODAY.\nAN INCREDIBLE SUITE OF THINGS WE DO FOR THEM.\nAND HOW TO DEEPEN RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE CLIENTS, AK WE SKIGS\nWILL BE PART OF WHAT WE LOOK AT. BUT ALSO GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES.\n>> WE HEARD YESTERDAY YOU'RE GOING TO GET A NEW TENANT IN THE\nNASDAQ.

SO I THINK THERE'S HOPE AND\nOPTIMISM THERE. >> WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS\nUNDER A PRESIDENT TRUMP? >> IT'S INTERESTING.\nWHEN YOU WATCH THE MARKET. RIGHT?\nI MEAN, TRUMP'S NOT EVEN PRESIDENT YET AND THERE'S\nALREADY THE IRRATIONALITY OF WHAT COULD BE AND ENTHUSIASM OF\nWHAT COULD BE. THE HOUSING MARKET RIGHT NOW IS\nON FAIRLY STABLE GROUND.

I UNDERSTAND THERE HAS BEEN A\nRUSH OF PEOPLE TRYING TO LOCK IN A LOWER RATES A THIS POINT.\n>> RIGHT. CLEARLY THERE'S BEEN A RESULT\nFROM THE INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT.\nWE'RE HANDLING IT NO PROBLEM.

IT WAS DESIGNED ALMOST ENTIRELY\nIN THE '70s AND '80s TO COMPETE  JAPANESE AND THE GERMANS.\nTHEY COMPETE IN EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD.\nTWICE AS MANY WORKERS ABROAD AS THERE ARE IN THE U.S.\nSO WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION, WHAT IT MEANS\nFOR PRODUCTION, MANUFACTURING PRODUCTION IN THIS COUNTRY ALONG\nWITH AN UPDATE ON BHI AND ALSTEM AND THE Q-4 GUIDE AND MEDIA.\nTHERE AREN'T A LOT OF LARGE CAP CEOs WHO DEALT DIRECTLY WITH\nTRUMP IN HIS PRIVATE LIFE. IMMELT DID SOME OF THAT WHEN GE\nOWNED NBC AND NBC RAN \"THE APPRENTICE.\"\nSO THAT'S COMING UP IN THE 11:00 A.M. HOUR EAST COAST TIME.\nWE CAN'T WAIT. >> WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO IT\nALSO, CARL, THANK YOU. >> THE STOCK LOOKS LIKE IT'S\nBREAKING OUT. >> GE.\n>> YEAH. >> IT WOULD BE CURIOUS TO HEAR\nHIS THOUGHTS. IT'S FUNNY, IN THE FEW\nCONVERSATIONS I'VE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE WITH CHIEF EXECUTIVES,\nEMBRACING, AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT, TAX REFORM, INFRASTRUCTURE\nSPENDING. VERY CONCERNED ABOUT IMMIGRATION\nAND BELIEVE THAT IF IN FACT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION FOLLOWS\nTHROUGH ON THE PROMISES MADE DURING THE CAMPAIGN THAT WILL BE\nA NEGATIVE FOR THE ECONOMY AND FOR BUSINESS OVERALL.\n>> OBVIOUSLY IN THAT NEWSPAPER, CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY, THEY\nTALKED ABOUT WE COULD SWITCH FROM BOEING TO AIRBUS.\nGE IS AGNOSTIC AND CAN HAVE THEIR ENGINES EVERYWHERE.\nYOU NOTICE THAT THEIR BIDS IN TECH ARE FURIOUSLY AGAIN BECAUSE\nINTEREST RATES -- IT TURNED OUT THEY WERE SO TIED IN WITH\nINTEREST RATES. YOU'LL SELL THE BANKS WITH RATES\nCOMING DOWN. EVEN DOWN A LITTLE BIT, AND\nYOU'LL BUY THE FINANCIALS. ONE I WANT YOU TO KEEP TRACK OF.\n>> PLEASE TELL ME. >> IS THE FEATURES THAT TWITTER\nADDED LAST NIGHT. CONTROL FEATURES EXPANDING THE\nMUTE FEATURE, GIVING THE ABILITY TO MUTE WORDS AND PHRASES.\nHATEFUL CONDUCT OPTION WITH REPORTING FLOW, I LIKE.\nIMPROVE THE ABILITY TO PROCESS THESE REPORTS.\nA LOT OF THIS -- ENFORCEMENT OVERALL IN TRAINING OUR SUPPORT\nTEAMS, ALL OF THE THINGS ARE SOMETHING SO THAT SALESFORCE\nBACKED AWAY EVEN AS MARK BENIOFF REITERATED THEY MAY HAVE ELECTED\nTHE PRESIDENT. I JUST POINT THAT OUT BECAUSE A\nLOT OF OUR VIEWERS FOCUS ON TWEETING AND SOME OF US GOT SO\nTURNED OFF BECAUSE OUR WIVES LOOK AT IT OR OUR KIDS AND SAY,\nGEEZ, THAT'S A HORRIBLE THING. >> IT CAN BE VERY DEFLATING IF\nPEOPLE ARE ATTACKING YOU. EVEN IF IT'S 1 OUT OF 50.\n>> MINE IS CLOSER TO 25 OUT OF 60.\n>> OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW THE COMPANY WELL.\nIS THIS AN IMPORTANT SEMINAL MOMENT FOR THEM OR JUST\nANOTHER -- OH, CARL HAS STEPPED AWAY.\nYOU KNOW WHAT, LET'S TAKE A BREAK AND TALK A BIT MORE ABOUT\nTWITTER WHEN WE COME BACK ON \"SQUAWK ON THE STREET.\"\nALSO BE FOCUSING ON THE MARKETS FOR YOU AS WELL.\nWE'VE GOT A LOT MORE.

VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT.\nTHE OTHER HALF OF THIS CONFERENCE, DAVID, IS ABOUT GE'S\nDIGITAL EFFORTS. THEY CALL IT OUTCOME AS A\nSERVICE, TRYING TO HELP SOMEONE WITH A VERY EXPENSIVE TOOL, LIKE\nA JET ENGINE, GET ANOTHER PERCENTAGE POINT OF EFFICIENCY\nBY LEVERAGING THINGS LIKE AUGMENTED REALITY AND THE AMAZON\nECHO. THIS IS WHERE THEY SHOW ALL OF\nTHAT OFF. IT'S BEEN A BIG PART OF THEIR\nMARKETING CAMPAIGN. YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN THEIR\nCOMMERCIALS OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS.\nBUT THIS IS THE FIFTH YEAR THEY HAVE HELD THIS CONFERENCE.\nA LOT OF VENDORS AND PARTNERS, 2600 OF THEM.\nTHIS IS HOW THEY'RE STARTING TO EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE HOW CHANGES IN\nTHE INTERNET ARE GOING TO CHANGE THE INDUSTRIAL ECONOMY.\nWE LOOK FORWARD TO TALKING WITH JEFF ABOUT A.I., FOR INSTANCE.\nHOW IN THE WORLD DOES THAT CHANGE THE LIFE SPAN OF AN\nENGINE ON A 757.

I MEAN THIS IS NO LONGER PIE IN\nTHE SKY.

HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO IS THE\nCHAIRMAN AND CEO OF GENERAL ELECTRIC, JEFF IMMELT.\n>> HEY, CARL. >> ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE YOU.\n>> GOOD TO SEE YOU. >> THANKS FOR HAVING US.\nWE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE AMAZING THINGS GOING ON BEHIND\nUS TODAY. WHAT A WEEK.\nYOU GOT THIS ELECTION. YOU GOT THIS MARKET RESPONSE.\nPEOPLE WANT TO WRITE THIS SCRIPT, INVESTORS WARMING TO A\nPRO GROWTH PLAYBOOK WHERE WE'VE GONE FROM DEFLATION SCARE TO\nINFLATION STORY. >> AFTER BREXIT AND A NUMBER OF\nTHINGS AROUND THE WORLD, NOTHING SHOULD SURPRISE PEOPLE ANYMORE.\nTHE ELECTION BROKE DEFINITELY THE WAY MOST PEOPLE THOUGHT.\nWE SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED. YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT IN PLACE\nTHAT'S TALKING GROWTH THAT LOOKS LIKE HE'S WILLING TO INVEST BACK\nIN THE ECONOMY IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS.\nYOU SEE BOND PRICES GOING UP AND INVESTOR ENTHUSIASM, MAYBE A\nLITTLE BIT OF RELIEF FOR THE BANKS, WHICH I THINK IS A GOOD\nTHING. SO, LOOK, WE'VE BEEN IN SUCH A\nSLOW GROWTH WORLD, I REALLY THINK THAT IF YOU CAN FIND THE\nRIGHT MECHANISMS TO DRIVE SOME GROWTH BACK IN THE UNITED\nSTATES, THAT'S A GOOD THING. NOW, YOU KNOW, THE REAL MISSING\nGAP HAS BEEN PRODUCTIVITY. SO WE'VE GOT TO GET SOME\nINVESTMENT BACK INTO THE U.S. ECONOMY, SOME CAPITAL\nINVESTMENT, WHICH REALLY HAS BEEN LACKING SINCE THE FINANCIAL\nCRISIS. AND THAT, I THINK, IS THE\nPRESIDENT'S BIGGEST TASK. >> SO OF THE PILLARS THAT ARE\nINTENDED TO DO THAT, INFRASTRUCTURE, TAX REFORM,\nPROFIT REPAREPATRIOTION. >> I LOOK AT TAX REFORM, CARL,\nAND SAY BASICALLY WHAT'S BEEN SITTING OUT THE PAST DECADE IS\nCAPITAL INVESTMENT BACK IN THE U.S.\nIT'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT TAX REFORM IS KIND OF THE MISSING\nINGREDIENT THAT CAN HELP DRIVE SOME OF THAT CAPITAL INVESTMENT\nBACK. THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A\n3% GDP GROWTH U.S. AND 2% GDP GROWTH.\n0% INTEREST RATES FOR A DECADE NOW.\nIF YOU'RE A CONSUMER AND HAVE A JOB, YOU FEEL RICH.\nBUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TO CREATE THE KIND OF ECONOMIC GROWTH THAT\nI THINK THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO CREATE AND MOST PEOPLE WANT TO\nSEE. I THINK TAX REFORM IS ACTUALLY\nQUITE IMPORTANT WITH TERRITORIAL SYSTEM, REPATRIATION IS PART OF\nTHAT. >> YOU SOUND OPTIMISTIC.\n>> I'VE BEEN THROUGH EVERY CYCLE KNOWN TO MANKIND.\nTHE U.S. HAD BEEN IN A SLOW GROWTH MODE.\nTHERE'S ENOUGH GROWTH AROUND THE WORLD TO BE ABLE TO KEEP US\nGOING FORWARD. AND I THINK IF YOU COULD JUST\nSOLVE A FEW THINGS IN THE U.S. -- IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO\nDOES THEM, BUT IF YOU COULD JUST GET A FEW THINGS GOING, THERE'S\nLOTS OF PENT-UP DEMAND AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH.\n>> TRADE HAS BEEN A BIG PART OF THIS STORY.\nCARRIER PLANT IS TURNING INTO A TEST OF WHETHER A TRUMP\nPRESIDENCY CAN KEEP PRODUCTION FROM GOING OVERSEAS OR BEING\nREVERSED, COMING BACK IN. HOW LIKELY IS THAT?\nVOTERS WHO VOTED ON THAT, IS THAT A FOOL'S BET OR NOT?\n>> SO, I THINK PROTECTIONISM HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A DECADE OR\nMORE. PRESIDENT TRUMP ISN'T THE FIRST\nONE TO TALK ABOUT IT. IT'S BEEN GOING ON IN EUROPE,\nCHINA. THE WORLD I GREW UP IN WITH\nTHESE FREE TRADE DEALS AND ANYTHING LIKE THAT, ANYBODY THAT\nWAS PLANNING ON THAT GOING INTO THE FUTURE IS -- THAT'S NOT THE\nWAY WE'VE THOUGHT ABOUT GE. I THINK IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN\nEXACTLY WHAT THE NEW TRADE RULES ARE GOING TO BE.\nAND I THINK WE HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE.\nFOR SOMEONE LIKE US THAT'S AN EXPORTER, REALLY, WE MAKE AND\nSELL THINGS AROUND THE WORLD. WE CAN NAVIGATE THE WORLD ON OUR\nOWN. BUT IF YOU WALK THROUGH WALMART,\nHOME DEPOT, DO ALL THOSE PRODUCTS HAVE TO COME BACK TO\nTHE UNITED STATES? DO ALL THE HAIR DRYERS AND\nSNEAKERS AND REFRIGERATORS HAVE TO COME BACK -- IS THAT WHAT'S\nGOING TO, YOU KNOW, MAKE THE ECONOMY GROW AGAIN?\nI THINK PEOPLE HAVE TO SIT AND THINK THROUGH EXACTLY WHAT THE\nPUTS AND TAKES ARE. FOR US WE'RE A GLOBAL COMPANY.\nWE SELL IN 190 COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD.\nWE DO IT FROM A LOCAL STANDPOINT.\nWE'RE GOING TO KEEP GLOBALIZING. WE'RE AN EXPORTER.\nWE'RE GOING TO KEEP GLOBALIZING. I THINK THE WORLD WE LIVE IN\nTODAY IS SO DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS 10, 15, 20 YEARS AGO.\nYOU KNOW, I BELIEVE IN TRADE DEALS.\nBUT WE DON'T NEED TRADE DEALS IN GE.\nWHAT THE PRESIDENT WILL LEARN, WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL LEARN\nIS THAT AS HE TRAVELS THE WORLD, TRADE DEALS GIVES HIM POWER.\nTHE ABILITY TO USE TRADE AS AN ECONOMIC, LET'S SAY, NEGOTIATING\nTECHNIQUE, MAKES HIM MORE POWERFUL.\n>> BECAUSE HE'S SPEAKING THE LANGUAGE OF OUR COUNTRY.\n>> OTHER COUNTRIES. >> WHO ARE TRYING TO DO THE SAME\nTHING? >> EXACTLY.\nI'VE TRAVELED THE WORLD, CARL, FOR 35 YEARS.\nPEOPLE CARE ABOUT SAFETY. THEY CARE ABOUT GROWTH.\nIF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TRAVELS AROUND THE WORLD\nAND HAS NOTHING TO OFFER FROM A STANDPOINT OF ECONOMIC\nCONNECTION, YOU LOSE HALF OF YOUR NEGOTIATING POWER.\nTHIS GUY IS A NEGOTIATOR, A DEAL MAKER.\nLET'S JUST WAIT AND SEE WHAT HE DOES.\n>> CAN YOU THINK OF A POLICY -- CAN YOU GAME OUT A POLICY CHANGE\nTHAT WOULD RESULT IN A NET INCREASE IN GE DOMESTIC\nPRODUCTION? IS THAT EASY TO DO?\n>> LOOK, I THINK -- SO OUR DOMESTIC PRODUCTION WILL GO TO\nDIFFERENT MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD.\nTHINGS THAT MAKE US MORE PRODUCTIVE IN THE U.S. WILL MAKE\nUS BETTER, TAX REFORM, THE ABILITY TO INVEST BETTER.\nBETTER ROADS. BETTER PORTS.\nEXPORT/IMPORT BANK. THINGS LIKE THAT.\nFOR US TO MAKE MORE JET ENGINES, WE HAVE TO WIN EVEN HIGHER\nMARKET SHARES IN AFRICA, LATIN AMERICA, CHINA, PLACES LIKE\nTHAT. THAT'S THE FOOTPRINT WE HAVE.\nOUR GROWTH HERE HAS TO COME THROUGH EXPORTS.\n>> YOU GAVE A NOW FAMOUS SPEECH AT NYU IN MAY WHERE YOU\nBASICALLY SAID LOOK, BACKLASH AGAINST GLOBALIZATION ISN'T\nGOING ANYWHERE. IT'S GOING TO BE AROUND FOR A\nWHILE. WE'RE GOING TO LOCALIZE.\nTHE OLD PLAYBOOK IS NOT GOING TO CUT IT.\nI ASSUME THE ELECTION OF TRUMP REINFORCES THAT VIEW?\n>> AT THAT POINT, CARL, WE HAD TWO PEOPLE RUNNING FOR\nPRESIDENT, NEITHER ONE WHO WANTED TRADE DEALS.\nIF YOU'RE SITTING HERE AS A CEO OF A COMPANY AND WANT A TRADE\nDEAL YOU SHOULD HAVE YOUR HEAD EXAMINED.\nI THINK WHAT I WOULD SAY TO YOUR VIEWERS IS I'VE DONE THIS JOB\nSINCE 2001. IF YOU ASKED ME TO WRITE DOWN\nALL THE WAYS THAT THE WORLD IS DIFFERENT TODAY THAN IT WAS IN\n2001, WE WOULD STILL BE HERE AT MIDNIGHT.\nAND I WORRY ABOUT PEOPLE USING AN OLD PLAYBOOK TO LOOK AT THE\nWORLD TODAY. THE WAY EUROPEAN UNION IS\nDIFFERENT, THE WAY THE MIDDLE EAST WORKS, AFTER HAVING THESE\nCONFLICTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST FOR SO LONG, IS DIFFERENT.\nI HOPE PRESIDENT TRUMP TAKES A FORWARD-LOOKING VIEW AND NOT\nBACKWARD-LOOKING VIEW. I HOPE HE PUTS PEOPLE AROUND HIM\nTHAT HAVE A CONTEMPORARY PERSPECTIVE NOT FROM 2005, 1995\nOR 1985. >> YOU WORKED WITH HIM BEFORE.\nYOU SAID HE WAS ENDEARING, FUN TO WORK WITH, COMPETITIVE.\nIS THERE AN EXPERIENCE YOU'VE HAD WITH HIM THAT YOU FIND\nINSTRUCTIVE? >> LOOK, I THINK HE LIKES TO\nWIN. IF YOU JUST THINK ABOUT \"THE\nAPPRENTICE\" SAGA ITSELF, THIS -- THIS IS A COMCAST PROBLEM NOW,\nNOT MINE, RIGHT? BUT WE HANDED HIM A SHOW THAT\nWAS THE THINNEST CONCEPT I HAD EVER SEEN AND HE MADE IT LIKE A\n14-YEAR HIT SUCCESS. SO, THIS IS A GUY THAT'S A\nCOMPETITOR. HE WANTS TO WIN.\nI ALWAYS FOUND HIM TO BE A LISTENER AND A GUY THAT WANTED\nTO DO GOOD WORK. RIGHT?\n>> ONE LAST THING HERE. I DON'T WANT TO INFLATE THIS\nQUESTION. YOU HAVE STEVE BANNON ON THE\nCOVER OF THE \"NEW YORK TIMES.\" HOW DOES AN APPOINTMENT LIKE\nTHAT GET TALKED ABOUT IN BUSINESS?\n>> I NEVER MET STEVE BANNON. WE'RE A DIVERSE COMPANY.\nWE HAVE MANY MUSLIMS, MEXICANS AND MANY GREAT AMERICANS THAT\nWORK FOR THE COMPANY. A MILLION PEOPLE IN THE U.S.\nDEPEND ON GE TO GET IT RIGHT FOR THEIR LIVELIHOOD.\nOUR WORKERS, OUR SUPPLIERS. WE BELIEVE THAT EVERY PERSON\nAROUND THE WORLD DESERVES TO BE TREATED WITH RESPECT.\nI DON'T CARE WHO HE BRINGS IN. I'LL NEVER CHANGE MY OPINION ON\nHOW MUCH I BELIEVE MERIT, DIVERSITY, TREATING PEOPLE WITH\nRESPECT -- THAT'S A CORE AMERICAN VALUE.\nTHAT'S A CORE AMERICAN VALUE. THAT'S WHAT MAKES AMERICAN\nCAPITALISM THE ENVY OF THE WORLD, THE FACT THAT WE KNOW HOW\nTO WIN IN MARKETS BUT WE ALSO KNOW HOW TO DEVELOP PEOPLE.\nWE KNOW HOW TO TREAT PEOPLE. WE KNOW HOW TO FOLLOW THE RULES\nAND SET HIGH STANDARDS. THAT'S WHY WE'RE WELCOME.\n>> YOU'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT A CHANGE?\n>> IT CAN'T CHANGE. IN OTHER WORDS, IT'S SO CORE TO\nWHO WE ARE. THAT'S NOT THE DONALD TRUMP I\nKNEW, THOUGH. I'LL LET PEOPLE DRAW THEIR OWN\nEQUATIONS, BUT WE CAN NEVER FORGET WHO WE ARE.\n>> I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS ROOM.\nI JUST WALKED PAST AN AREA WHERE YOU COULD PUT ON A MICROSOFT\nHOLLOW LENS AND, USING THAT, HELP TO DETERMINE THE EFFICIENCY\nOF YOUR MANUFACTURING PROCESS AND MACHINERY.\n>> YEAH. >> YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR\nFIVE YEARS NOW, RIGHT? >> YEAH.\n>> THE TOOLS YOU'RE USING ARE SEEN AS PLAY THINGS BY A LOT OF\nPEOPLE. >> ESPECIALLY SOME OF THE GUYS\nON YOUR SET. >> YES.\nWE'VE DONE THAT BEFORE. HOW IS THIS EVOLVING?\n>> IT'S ALL ABOUT PRODUCTIVITY. IF YOU LOOK AT THE WORLD OF\nPRODUCTIVITY, PARTICULARLY AN INDUSTRIAL COMPANY, THIS NOTION\nOF BEING ABLE TO GET ANALYTICS OFF INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS OR\nMANUFACTURING IN NEW WAYS, IT'S REAL.\nTHIS IS HAPPENING. FOR US IT'S A $7 BILLION PLUS\nBUSINESS THAT'S GOING 20, 25% A YEAR.\nWHEN YOU WALK THROUGH THIS HALL, FOUR YEARS AGO, CARL, WE DID IT.\nTHERE WERE 300 PEOPLE. NOW THERE'S 2,500 PEOPLE.\nTHERE'S A PARTNER PROGRAM, CUSTOMERS.\nTHIS IS KIND OF THE FUTURE OF PRODUCTIVITY.\nIT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH OR WITHOUT GE.\nWE JUST WANT TO BE PART OF IT. WE WANT TO LEAD IT.\n>> YOU TALKED ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF OTHER COMPETITORS\nCOMING IN. >> SURE.\n>> AMAZON COULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS.\n>> HORIZONTAL PLAYERS, PEOPLE LIKE AMAZON, GOOGLE.\nVERTICAL PLAYERS, PEOPLE LIKE SEMAN'S OR OTHERS.\nWE TALK ABOUT FACEBOOK, SOCIAL MEDIA.\nCONSUMER INTERNET. IT'S GOING TO BE VERY DIFFERENT\nTHAN THE CONSUMER INTERNET OR ENTERPRISE INTERNET.\nCOMPANIES LIKE GE HAVE A REAL ADVANTAGE AND OPPORTUNITY TO\nPLAY THIS GAME VERY HARD AND VERY WELL.\n>> YOU TALKED ABOUT THE PEOPLE YOU BRING IN, THE NEW GRADUATES\nYOU BRING IN EVERY YEAR, 4,000 TO 5,000 GRADUATES.\nEVERY ONE OF THEM WILL LEARN TO CODE?\n>> COMPUTER SCIENCE IS KIND OF THE NEW LIBERAL ARTS.\nIT'S THE NEW LANGUAGE. PEOPLE HAVE TO BE PROFICIENT IF\nTHEY WANT TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE MODERN WORLD.\nIT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT FUNCTION, WHAT JOB YOU'RE IN.\nFOR YOUR VIEWERS, IT'S WORTH UNDERSTANDING.\nFOR INVESTORS OUT THERE, IT'S WORTH UNDERSTANDING EXACTLY HOW\nPROFOUND THIS CHANGE IS GOING TO BE.\nIT'S GOING TO IMPACT EVERY INDUSTRY.\n>> DOES THE ELECTION CHANGE ANY STRATEGY REGARDING M & A?\nYOU'VE DONE A LOT OF BOTH BUYING AND SELLING.\n>> MY VIEW IS OUR STRATEGIES HAVEN'T CHANGED.\nI DON'T REGRET BEING IN FINANCIAL SERVICES EVEN THOUGH\nBANK STOCKS HAVE HAD A GREAT WEEK.\nI CHEER MY FRIENDS LIKE JAMIE DIMON AND SAY, YOU GUYS HAVE\nEARNED IT. BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE ME SAY HOLY\nWHY DID WE GET OUT OF GE CAPITAL?\nWE KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING, HAVE A GOOD VISION FOR THE COMPANY.\nWE LIKE THE WAY THEY SHAPE UP FOR GE.\n>> WELLS FARGO, BEST SINCE ELECTION DAY, IF YOU CAN BELIEVE\nTHAT. THE BIGGEST LAGGER IS ALPHABET.\n>> I KNOW. >> WHETHER A BIG INFRASTRUCTURE\nPROGRAM DRAWS CAPITAL OUT OF INNOVATIVE START-UPS AND JUST\nINTO JUST MAKING STUFF THAT INVOLVES --\n>> CERTAINLY PEOPLE DOING A TRADE RIGHT NOW FROM A FINANCIAL\nSTANDPOINT. AGAIN, I WOULD GO BACK, CARL.\nWHAT'S BEEN MISSING IN U.S. ECONOMIC GROWTH THE LAST DECADE?\nCAPITAL INVESTMENT. THE CONSUMER IS DOING FINE.\nSO, CONSUMER COMPANIES LIKE GOOGLE, LIKE FACEBOOK, THEY'VE\nDONE FINE. WE HAVE NOT REINVESTED BACK IN\nTHE CORE OF THIS COUNTRY FOR A LONG TIME.\nAND IT REALLY PREDATES EVEN PRESIDENT OBAMA.\nSO IF, IN FACT, WE REINVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE, WE MAKE THE U.S.\nMORE PRODUCTIVE -- PRODUCTIVITY HAS STUNK IN THE U.S. FOR A\nDECADE NOW. THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A\n2% GDP GROWTH COUNTRY AND A 3% GDP GROWTH.\nAND THAT MEANS EVERYTHING TO US. GETTING THE COUNTRY BACK UP TO\n3% AND 3.5%. TAX REFORM, INFRASTRUCTURE.\nTHESE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT ITEMS, REALLY.\n>> AND IN THE BACK OF YOUR MIND, ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT HOW WE\nWILL HANDLE A TRULY INFLATIONARY ENVIRONMENT OR IS THAT --\n>> REALLY, I THINK IT'S SO BIZARRE TO HAVE HAD 0% INTEREST\nRATES FOR SO LONG. THINK ABOUT THINGS LIKE STATE\nPENSIONS AND STUFF LIKE THAT. 15 BILLION EUROS TRADING WITH\nNEGATIVE INTEREST RATES. THAT'S WARPED.\nI THINK THE NOTION OF GETTING A YIELD CURVE BACK, GETTING A\nLITTLE BIT OF GROWTH BACK, GETTING PRODUCTIVITY BACK IN THE\nSYSTEM SO YOU CAN OFF-SET INFLATION AND THINGS LIKE THAT.\nAND THEN I COME BACK TO 5% OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION, 25% OF\nTHE WORLD'S GDP. EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD KNOW THAT.\nTHIS COUNTRY HAS TO WIN GLOBALLY.\nWE HAVE TO ENGAGE GLOBALLY. IT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN SUSTAIN\nOUR STANDARD OF LIVING. IN MANY WAYS THE ELECTION, BOTH\nBERNIE SANDERS, DONALD TRUMP, HILLARY CLINTON, EVERYBODY THAT\nRAN TALKED ABOUT CREATING A MIDDLE CLASS JOB, $30 AN HOUR\nMANUFACTURING JOB. IN ORDER TO DO THAT YOU NEED\nINFRASTRUCTURE. YOU ALSO NEED GLOBAL MARKETS,\nLESS REGULATION. WE ALL NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT\nIT TAKES TO CREATE THAT AND GO GET THAT WORK DONE.\n>> LAST QUESTION FOR ME. YOU BOUGHT SOME SHARES IN A\nCOUPLE OF ROUNDS THIS SUMMER. >> YEP.\n>> IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE ANY KIND OF GRANT OR ORPGSS\nEXERCISE. IS THAT A STATEMENT YOU'RE\nMAKING? >> I LOVE WHERE THE COMPANY'S\nPOSITIONED. I CAN NEVER OWN ENOUGH GE STOCK.\nI LOVE THE POSITIONING FOR THE FUTURE.\nAND, YOU KNOW, I HAVE A VERY SIMPLE PORTFOLIO.\nGE. AND I KEEP BUYING.\n>> JEFF, GOOD TO HAVE YOU. >> THANK YOU.\n>> JEFF IMELT, GE CHAIRMAN AND CEO AT THE CONFERENCE.\nWE'LL GO TO DR. MILKEN OF THE MILKEN INSTITUTE WHEN \"SQUAWK\nALLEY\" CONTINUES.

CANDIDATE TRUMP, WHAT DOES HE\nWANT TO DO? HE WANTS TO CUT TAXES, RIGHT?\nHE WANTS TO BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE, BUILD UP OUR\nARMED FORCES, AND BE TOUGH ON OUR TRADING PARTNERS.\nA PHILOSOPHY THAT INCLUDED SCRAPPING NAFTA TO GET BACK AT\nMEXICO AND PERHAPS THROWING TARIFFS ON THE HOST OF GOODS WE\nIMPORT FROM CHINA. LAST WEEK'S RALLY WAS BASED ON\nTHE FIRST PART OF THE PREMISE. YOU GOT TAXES, YOU BUILD MORE\nAND INTEREST RATES GO HIGH, WHICH IS GOOD FOR THE BANKS AND\nTHEY'VE CONTINUE TO RALLY. YOU GIVE PEOPLE MORE DISPOSABLE\nINCOME. THAT'S GOOD FOR RETAILERS AND\nTRAVEL AND LEISURE COMPANIES.

IT MIGHT HURT SOME OF YOUR\nCOMPANIES. WE BEGIN TO SEE SOME OF THIS\nWEAKNESS WHEN TECH LAST WEEK.

DO YOU RECALL ON FEBRUARY 11th\nWITH THE BANKS AT THE EXACT LOW FOR THE YEAR, JAMIE DIMON, THE\nCEO OF JPMORGAN CHASE BOUGHT 500,000 SHARES IN THE OPEN\nMARKET AT $53.18 FOR A TOTAL COST OF $26.6 BILLION.\nYOU GOT TO LOOK AT THE CHART. YOU WON'T BELIEVE IT.\nIT'S THE AND EXACT BOTTOM. TODAY'S PRICE, THAT'S NOW WORTH\n$40 MILLION. NOW, LOOKING BACK, WE COULD\nARGUE IT WAS A CALLED SHOT, ONE OF THOSE AMAZING HOME RUNS THAT\nDIMON SAID WOULD HAPPEN. BUT IT REALLY WASN'T LIKE THAT\nAT ALL. WHAT DIMON SAID WHEN HE BOUGHT\nTHE STOCK IN FEBRUARY WAS IT WAS TOO CHEAP RELATIVE TO THE\nFUNDAMENTALS. IT SURE WAS.\nOF COURSE EVERY CEO THINKS HIS STOCK IS CHEAP BUT WHEN YOU SEE\nTHAT KIND OF INSIDER BUYING, THAT'S NOT SOME SORT OF PAINT\nTHE TAPE COUPLE OF THOUSAND SHARE PURCHASE THAT PEOPLE TALK\nABOUT. THAT'S REAL MONEY.\nWHAT WE USED TO CALL IT ON THE TRADING DESK WAS A STATEMENT\nBUY. THE STATEMENT BEING ENOUGH IS\nENOUGH. JPMORGAN STOCK IS A SAFE PLACE\nTO INVEST. IT'S TOO LOW.\nEVERY SOME FED OFFICIAL SAYS THERE'S NO ABILITY TO RAISE\nRATES SINCE THE ECONOMY IS TOO WEAK.\nNOW, THOUGH, WITH INTEREST RATES REALLY MOVING UP, BANKS CAN\nSTART MAKING A TON OF MONEY ON MORTGAGES AND REGULAR LENDING,\nAND THE FED HAS THE COVER TO RAISE SHORT TERM RATES BECAUSE\nTHE MARKET ITSELF IS MOVING LONG TERM RATES.\nIT'S GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHEN YOU SEE A SLATE OF FED HEADS\nLIKE YOU HAVE THIS WEEK, YOU ACTUALLY HOPE THEY'RE HAWKISH TO\nKEEP THIS MOVE GOING. BANKS ARE PART OF A MASSIVE\nUNDEROWNED PORTION OF THIS MARKET, ALONG WITH THE\nTRANSPORTS. THE INDUSTRIALS, AND THE BROAD\nLINE RETAILERS. THEY JUST CAUSE TOO MUCH\nDISAPPOINTMENT TO OWN. IF YOU THOUGHT THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON WAS GOING TO BE PRESIDENT, THIS GROUP WOULD HAVE\nBEEN ABSOLUTELY TOXIC. THINK ABOUT THE STRIKES AGAINST\nTHE BANKS. FIRST THERE WAS GRIDLOCK.\nWEB WHEN WE LOVED GRIDLOCK BECAUSE IT MEANT THE GOVERNMENT\nWOULDN'T DO ANYTHING, COULDN'T SPEND MUCH?\nNOW OUR BUILDER IN CHIEF, PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP, GETS TAP\nADD SOMEONE WHO WILL BUST THE BUDGET AND THAT'S DRIVING RATES\nUP. SECOND, WITH REPUBLICANS\nCONTROLLING NOT JUST THE PRESIDENCY BUT BOTH HOUSES OF\nCONGRESS, THE FINANCIALS WON'T HAVE TO SUFFER THROUGH MULTIPLE\nYEARS OF DEMOCRATIC HECTORING FROM THE LIKES OF SENATOR\nELIZABETH WARREN FROM MASSACHUSETTS.\nTHIRD, THE LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE SPENDING HAS BEEN SO HORRENDOUS,\nHORRIFIC, THAT IT ROUTINELY IMPACTED EARNINGS PER SHARE.\nIF TRUMP DOES DISMANTLE DODD/FRANK THEN THESE COMPANIES\nWON'T NEED AS MANY WORKERS IN THEIR COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENTS.\nTHEY WON'T NEED TO SPEND SO MUCH MONEY ON OUTSIDE LAWYERS.\nREMEMBER, DEUTSCHE BANK IS ALSO IN BIG TROUBLE WITH THE JUSTICE\nDEPARTMENT OVER SOME OUTSTANDING MORTGAGE ISSUES.\nTRUMP HAS A GAET RELATIONSHIP WITH DEUTSCHE BANK.\nWHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF HE CALLS ANGELA MERKEL AND AGREES IF THEY\nPAY A REASONABLE FINE? A WIN FOR EVERYBODY?\nFINALLY EVEN THOUGH INTEREST RATES ARE LOW, MANY PEOPLE DON'T\nMAKE ENOUGH AFTER-TAX INCOME TO ACTUALLY GET A LOAN FROM A BANK.\nWITH LOWER TAXES, THAT CHANGES TOO.\nMORE TAKE-HOME PAY MEANS FOR LENDING, ESPECIALLY SECOND HOUSE\nLENDING, WHICH HAS REALLY BEEN SHUT DOWN THE LAST FEW YEARS.\nDID JAMIE DIMON KNOW SOMETHING WE DIDN'T?\nONLY THAT HIS STOCK HAD GOTTEN RIDICULOUSLY LOW NO MATTER WHO\nWON FOR PRESIDENT. BUT IF YOU GO OVER BANK AND\nAMERICA, YOU COULD SAY AS WELL THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE A TON OF\nINSIDER BUYING. DIMON KNEW THE NEGATIVITY HAD\nGOTTEN OUT OF HAND. HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF IT AND HE\nBOUGHT. LOOKING BACK, IT SEEMS EASY.\nAT THE TIME, YOU NEEDED FAITH. YOU NEEDED BELIEF, AND HE HAD\nBOTH IN SPADES.

THAT GETS YOU INTO THE MID TO\nHIGH 50s. NOT A HUNDRED.\n>> WHAT IS TECH NOW? IS TECH SOCIAL MEDIA?\nIS IT SEMICONDUCTORS? IS IT TELECOM?\nWHAT IS IT? >> IT'S A BIG TENT.\n>> WHAT'S ATTRACTIVE, WHAT'S NOT ATTRACTIVE?\n>> WHAT'S INTERESTING IS WHAT'S HAPPENED SINCE TRUMP GOT\nELECTED. I THINK PEOPLE HAVE MAYBE\nMISINTERPRETED THAT TO BEING SOMETHING THAT SILICON VALLEY\nNOT BEING A SUPPORTER OF PETER THIEL AND PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP\nHAS HAD HARSH WORDS ABOUT JEFF BEZOS AND AMAZON IN PARTICULAR.\nI THINK THE SELLOFF IS DUE MUCH MORE TO THE FACT THAT GROWTH IS\nEXPECTED TO BE FASTER UNDER TRUMP.\nAND THEREFORE THE SCARCITY OF GROWTH WILL BE LESS.\nAND SO THE BIGGEST GROWTH COMPANIES OUT THERE LIKE AMAZON,\nFACEBOOK, GOOGLE, THERE'S MORE COMPETITION FOR THOSE DOLLARS.\nMONEY IS FLOWING OUT OF THAT. I THINK THE SELLOFF IN ALL THREE\nOF THOSE NAMES IS CREATING A GOOD BUYING OPPORTUNITY HERE.\n>> ASIDE FROM ROTATION, THOUGH, IS THERE A CONCERN THAT AMAZON\nIN PARTICULAR MIGHT HAVE A TARGET ON ITS BACK GIVEN THE\nCOMMENTS THAT MR. TRUMP HAS MADE ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL\nESSENTIALLY SAYING THERE ARE GOING TO BE HUGE ANTITRUST\nCONCERNS GIVEN THERE COULD BE TRADE WARS AND AMAZON HAS A\nTHIRD OF ITS PHYSICAL FOOTPRINT OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES NOT\nTHAT MUCH IN RETAIL SALES OVERSEAS?\nALL THESE THINGS ADD UP TO BE POSSIBLE CONCERNS ABOUT AMAZON\nON TOP OF THAT ROTATION THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.\n>> YEAH.

YOU TALKED ABOUT ANTITRUST.\nTHERE'S NO ISSUE WITH ANTITRUST FOR AMAZON AT ALL.\nBUT THEY'VE HAD THAT ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO ELECTRONIC BOOKS.\nAND AMAZON CONTROLLING 85% OF THAT MARKET, THE ISSUE ISN'T\nPART OF THE MARKET CONTROL. IT'S WHAT THE CONSUMER GETS OUT\nOF IT. AMAZON IS ALMOST ALWAYS THE LOW\nPRICE. THE SIZE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH\nTHAT. >> YOU'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE\nTARGET BECAUSE HE CAN'T REALLY GO AFTER AMAZON?\n>> WELL, HE CAN USE A LOT OF RHETORIC ON AMAZON, I THINK.\nBUT IT CREATES HEADLINE RISKS SO PEOPLE DON'T LIKE HEADLINE\nRISKS. >> WE'RE BACK TO THE CANDIDATE\nVERSUS PRESIDENT. THE THEME OF ALL COMPANIES IF\nTHEY GET TOO BIG, IT'S BAD. BUT IF YOU ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE\nAT&T/TIME WARNER IN TERMS OF VERTICAL INTEGRATION AND\nEVERYTHING ELSE AND IF HE TALKS TO THE REGULATORS DECIDING ON\nTHE DEAL AND THEY SAY IN THE END IT'S GOING TO BE BETTER FOR\nCONSUMERS, ADVANCE THE TECHNOLOGY.\nI GUARANTEE YOU A REPUBLICAN IS GOING TO BE MORE LIKELY TO LET\nIT GO THAN HILLARY. THAT'S WHY IT MAKES SENSE.\n>> THE DISTINCTION BEING HE CAME OUT PUBLICLY AND SAID THIS WAS\nTERRIBLE. WE HAVE TO BREAK UP --\n>> BUT THAT'S THE POPULOUS RHETORIC ABOUT BIG COMPANIES.\nI'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THIS WOULD -- I'VE NEVER BELIEVED\nTHAT THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING HE WOULD BUY.\nI ALWAYS THOUGHT AT&T/TIME WARNER WOULD WORK.\n>> YOU DIDN'T THINK HE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH WHEN HE SAID\nTHAT. >> NO.\n>> BACK TO THE -- >> I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE\nSUPPOSED TO MAKE OF IT. >> WELL, THE HUNDRED OTHER\nTHINGS WHERE YOU SAID YOU JUST LOOK AT IT AND SAY MY GOD.\nAND MORTIFIED. SO JUST THROW THAT IN WITH\nEVERYTHING ELSE. THE WALL AND MUSLIM.\n>> CAN I ASK ABOUT THE ROTATION MORE?\n>> COULD I STOP YOU? >> I DON'T KNOW.\nYOU KEEP TALKING. BACK TO ROTATION.\nYOU MAKE A GOOD TALK IN TERMS OF EVERYBODY WAS GOING TO\nTECHNOLOGY FOR GROWTH BECAUSE THAT WAS SEEN AS THE PLACE TO GO\nFOR GROWTH. AT THIS POINT WILL THOSE\nMANAGERS COME BACK? IS THIS A ROTATION THAT'S A SORT\nOF CHANGE IN THE MARKET AT THIS PLACE?\nIN YOUR VIEW? OR DOES IT COME BACK?\n>> WELL, IT'S GOING TO DEPEND ON THE INDIVIDUAL COMPANY\nFUNDAMENTALS AT THE END OF THE DAY.\nI THINK THAT THE GREATER ROTATION IS OUT OF UTILITIES,\nBOND PROXIES. I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE GREATER\nDANGER IS. ALPHABET IS 18 TIMES NEXT YEAR'S\nEARNINGS. THIS IS SORT OF DEMANDING IN\nTHIS KIND OF AN ENVIRONMENT. AND FACEBOOK DESPITE THE\nSLOWDOWN IN FACEBOOK, YOU'RE STILL COMING TO THE LOW 20s\nMULTIPLE. SO THE CONSUMER STAPLE HAS BEEN\nCARRYING THOSE MULTIPLES AND THEY GROW 3% TO 5%.\n>> SO WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE ROTATION AND WHETHER THE\nMONEY GOES BACK? >> I DON'T HAVE A STRONG VIEW ON\nTHAT. I THINK THERE'S STILL SOME\nINTERESTING NAMES IN TECHNOLOGY. WE STILL LIKE TWITTER A LOT.\nIT'S A DOMINANT FRANCHISE. IF YOU JUST LOOK AT ITS\nVALUATION RELATIVE TO ITS USERS. FACEBOOK HAS 35 TIMES --\nFACEBOOK IS ROUGHLY 35 TIMES THE VALUE, SIX TIMES THE USERS AS\nTWITTER. SO THERE'S A LOT OF SPACE FOR\nTWITTER TO MAKE MONEY ON USERS. THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID ON THE\nLAST CALL. THEY'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON\nPROFITABILITY AND RUN IT LIKE A BUSINESS.\nHOPEFULLY DOING ATE WAY WITH INCENTIVE OPTION PLANS THAT HAVE\nBEEN DESTRUCTIVE FOR SHAREHOLDERS VALUE.\nBUT WE'RE OPTIMISTIC ON TWITTER. >> AND JANA PARTNERS IS A NEW\nSHAREHOLDER THERE. THEY'RE AN ACTIVIST SO THAT WILL\nHELP. >> WHEN YOU TALK TECH, IT'S ALL\nTHIS SOCIAL MEDIA STUFF. DO YOU BUY CISCO NOW?\nIS THAT TECH? >> YEAH.\n>> IT IS? BUT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT\nANYMORE. WE TALK ABOUT THIS TWITTER WHICH\nI HAVE RIGHT HERE AND -- BUT SOCIAL MEDIA THAT'S TECH.\n>> YEAH. I --\n>> WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE THAT MAKE THE CONNECTERS AND ALL THE STUFF\nTHAT GOES INTO THE PHONES AND ALL THAT STUFF?\nANY OF THAT? YOU STILL OWN THAT STUFF OR NO?\nTHAT'S GOING TO BUILD OUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THIS GREAT\nFUTURE? INTERNET OF THINGS, ALL THESE\nTHINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING? >> QUITE A NICE RUN.\n>> QUALCOMM. IT'S TECH THAT'S NOT SOCIAL.\n>> HE LIKES TO BUY THINGS THAT WILL DOUBLE.\n>> HE WAS IN NXPA. >> NOW YOU CAN GET OUT OF THAT.\n>> QUALCOMM. >> ALL RIGHT.\nTHEN YOU'VE GOT TO BE REALLY SMART TO FIGURE OUT THE NEXT\nWAVE AFTER SOCIAL MEDIA OR WHAT PART OF SOCIAL MEDIA IS THE NEXT\nWAVE.

WE LOOKED AT DONALD TRUMP'S PLAN\nFOR A BORDER WALL EARLIER. HE HAS SOME OTHER FOREIGN OELS\nIDEAS THAT COULD ALSO SHAKE UP AMERICA'S APPROACH TO GLOBAL\nAFFAIRS. HOW TO DEAL WITH RUSSIA.\nWITH NATO. THE WAR AGAINST ISIS TO NAME A\nFEW. I WANT TO BRING IN TWO OF OUR\nNATIONAL SECURITY EXPERTS. WE HAVE CNN MILITARY ANALYST\nLIEUTENANT GENERAL MARK HERTLING, SERVED AS COMMANDING\nGENERAL FOR U.S. ARMY IN EUROPE IN THE 7th ARMY AND WITH US, CNN\nCOUNTERTERRORISM ANALYST PHIL MUDD, CIA COUNTERTERRORISM\nOFFICIAL. PHIL, START WITH YOU, BECAUSE\nONE OF THE THINGS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO\nIS DONALD TRUMP'S REQUEST THAT HIS KIDS HAVE SECURITY\nCLEARANCE. THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO SEE SECRET\nTHINGS THAT OBVIOUSLY THE AVERAGE CITIZEN WOULDN'T BE ABLE\nTO HAVE. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?\nAND HOW UNUSUAL IS THAT? >> FIRST OF ALL, BRIANNA, I'M\nNOT SURE A REQUEST. I THINK REPORTING IS THERE WAS\nAN INQUIRY MADE. I'D LIKE TO TELL PEOPLE TO\nSETTLE DOWN ON THIS. LET ME GIVE AYOU A CLEAR PICTUR.\nA PRESIDENT-ELECT RELIED ON THREE INDIVIDUALS IN THEIR 30s,\nYOUNG PEOPLE WITHOUT A LOT OF EXPERIENCE, DURING A CAMPAIGN.\nTHAT PRESIDENT-ELECT NOW MOVES INTO A NEW POSITION THAT SAYS, I\nWANT THESE PEOPLE WHO I TRUST ALSO TO BE PART OF MY NATIONAL\nSECURITY CONVERSATIONS. FOR THEM TORE PART OF THAT\nCONVERSATION THERE IS TO HAVE A TOP-SECRET CLEARANCE.\nTWO OF THOSE PEOPLE HAPPEN TO BE NAMED TRUMP.\nTHEY ARE CHILDREN. ONE A SON F-IN-LAW.\nODD, NOT SHOCKING HE WANTS TO RELY ON THE SAME PEOPLE HE'S\nELIED UPON ALL ALONG. THE REAL QUESTION IS NOT WHETHER\nTHEY GET A CLEARANCE. THE QUESTION, HOW YOU SEPARATE\nOUT WHATEVER CORPORATE INTEREST THEY MAINTAIN IN TRUMP\nORGANIZATIONS WITH WHETHER THEY PARTICIPATE IN NATIONAL SECURITY\nCONVERSATIONS, BECAUSE I DON'T THINK YOU CAN DO BOTH AT THE\nSAME TIME. >> NO.\nTHAT'S A HUGE ISSUE, AND A POTENTIAL CONFLICT THERE.\nGENERAL HERTLING, WHEN YOU HEARD ABOUT THIS INQUIRY, WHAT WAS THE\nFIRST THING THAT CAME TO YOUR MIND?\nARE YOU CONCERNED? THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO\nLOOKED AND SAID, WELL, YOU KNOW, HIS KIDS GAVE HIM THIS ELEMENT\nOF BEING MEASURED. THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAD CALMING\nADVICE AND WERE INFLUENTIAL ON HIM.\nI DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S ENOUGH FOR THIS INQUIRY TO BE GRANTED,\nTHOUGH. >> YES.\nI'M IN LINE WITH PHIL ON THIS ONE, BRIANNA.\nI THINK A PRESIDENT CAN PICK ANYONE HE WANTS TO BE AN\nADVISER. WHEN THAT HAPPENS THEY'RE GOING\nTO BE PRIVY TO STATE SECRETS AND SOMETIMES THE WAY THOSE SECRETS\nARE ACTUALLY GARNERED. THE PROBLEM IS, HOW DO YOU\nSEPARATE INFORMATION WHICH WOULD BE AS PART OF THOSE SECRETS FROM\nA PRIVATE SECTOR EFFORT? YOU KNOW, CAN YOU SEPARATE\nWHAT'S GOING ON ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT WITH WHAT'S GOING ON\nON BEHALF OF A PRIVATE BUSINESS? WHEN YOU'RE SEEING A CABLE AS AN\nEXAMPLE SAYING THIS IS GOING ON IN THIS COUNTRY AND HERE'S\nWHAT'S AFFECTING IT, COULD YOU USE THAT FOR A BUSINESS\nADVANTAGE? SO CERTAINLY, YOU KNOW, MR.\nTRUMP CAN PICK ANYONE HE WANTS TO BE HIS ADVISERS, BUT, BOY, WE\nBETTER BE VERY, VERY CAREFUL ABOUT A A CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nOR HOW THEY USE THAT INFORMATION FOR THINGS OTHER THAN SERVING\nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE GOVERNMENT.\nTHAT'S THE CRITICAL PART. >> THE BIG ISSUE THERE.\nTALK ABOUT RUSSIA, PHIL. WHEN YOU SEE THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN\nAND DONALD TRUMP HAVE THE SPOKEN.\nTHERE'S A DESIRE FOR THEM TO HAVE A BETTER RELATIONSHIP\nBETWEEN THE U.S. AND RUSSIA. YOU LOOK AT THAT, WHAT IS YOUR\nREACTION? >> I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE\nPRESIDENT IS TRYING TO DO. HE'S TRYING TO RESET AT A TIME\nWHERE NOT ONLY IS THE RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA POOR\nBUT WE HAVE CRITICAL INTERESTS PARTICULARLY IN SYRIA.\nDO WE WANT TO CONTINUE SUPPORTING SYRIAN OP SAINGSD\nLETTING A CIVIL WAR CONTINUE OR CUT A DEAL WITH RUSSIA THAT\nSAYS, MAYBE THAT BUTCHER, BSH B\nBASHAR AL ASSAD WILL STAY IN POWER BULL FOCUS ALL ATTENTION\nON ISIS. STEP BACK.\nAS TIME GOES ON, I SAY, A NEW PRESIDENT-ELECT SEES WHAT THE\nRUSSIANS ARE DOING IN PLACES LIKE EUROPE WHAT THEY DID I\nCRIMEA, THEY MIGHT THREATEN OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, THINGS\nLIKE CUTTING OFF ENERGY. HACKING AMERICAN COMPANIES IN\nTERMS OF NOT ONLY U.S. GOVERNMENT BUT A TRUMP WHITE\nHOUSE, I THINK A COLLISION WITH REALITY AT SOME POINT RESETTING\nTHIS EFFORT TO MAKE THE RELATIONSHIP WITH PUTIN BETTER.\nI THIS VERY DIFFICULT TO DO. >> HOW DOES --\n>> AND, BRIANNA. >> GO ON.\n>> IF I CAN ADD TO THAT. PHIL IS RIGHT AGAIN.\nTWICE IN ONE DAY. AMAZING.\nWHAT I'D SAY, LOOK BACK AT THE HISTORY, THE HISTORY OF OUR PAST\nSEVERAL PRESIDENTS, EACH ONE OF THEM HAVE COME INTO OFFICE\nSAYING, I WANT TO RESET CONDITIONS WITH RUSSIA.\nAND EVERY TIME THERE'S BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF HOOPLA ABOUT THAT,\nAND PEOPLE SOMETIMES FORGET THAT RUSSIA INFLUENCES MANY OTHER\nCOUNTRIES. YOU HAVE TO TAKE A WIDE VIEW\nWHEN YOU'RE TALKING STRATEGY, AND YOU CAN'T JUST GO NATION TO\nNATION. WHO ELSE IS AFFECTED BY A VERY\nGOOD RELATION. WITH RUSSIA?\nCERTAINLY IF WE CAN IMPROVE RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA, THAT'S A\nGOOD THING. BUT HOW ARE OUR OTHER ALLIES\nGOING TO LOOK THAT? SOMEONE WHO SPENT A LOT OF TIME\nIN EUROPE AND WITH NATO PARTNERS, THEY ARE SCARED TO\nDEATH RIGHT NOW ACROSS THE BOARD THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE A\nPUTTING ASIDE OF SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE DONE AS AN\nALINES AGAINST RUSSIA, BECAUSE THEY'RE GETTING INTO UKRAINE,\nINTO SYRIA, OTHER COUNTRIES AND CONCERNED THE CYBER HACKS GOING\nON, NOT ONLY BEEN DIRECTED AT US, HAVE ALSO BEEN DIRECTED AT\nOTHER COUNTRIES. LIKE ESTONIA, LATVIA, LITHUANIA.\nTHERE IS CONCERN ABOUT UNILATERAL VIEW OF SAYING, WE'RE\nGOING TO RESET CONDITION WITH RUSSIA WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING\nTHAT THERE'S A MUCH WIDER PICTURE TO DEAL WITH WHENEVER\nYOU HAVE THOSE KIND OF UNILATERAL AGREEMENTS.\n>> GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

I THINK TRUMP IS GOING TO BE THE\nOPPOSITE. HE THINK HE WILL BE A STRONG\nLEADER AND I THINK THAT WILL HAVE TWO DRAMATIC IMPACTS ON\nPUTIN. NUMBER ONE, IT WILL MAKE HIM A\nLOT MORE HESITANT TO TRY TO EXTEND RUSSIAN INFLUENCE.\nAND TWO, WHAT MAY SEEM PARADOXICAL WHICH I THINK IT IS\nTRUE, IT WILL MAKE PUTIN MORE INCLINED TO COOPERATE BECAUSE HE\nWILL BELIEVE IF HE MAKES A DEAL WITH ANOTHER STRONG LEADER, THEY\nBOTH WILL STICK TO IT.

BUT LOOK, THIS IS A MULTISIDED\nCONFLICT AND DESTRUCTION OF ANY ONE COMBATANT WILL NECESSARILY\nADVANTAGE ALL THE OTHERS. THE WAY OBAMA IS APPROACHES IT\nWILL ADVANTAGE IRAN MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE.\nI THINK THAT'S A MISTAKE. WE OUGHT TO PICK THE ROUTE TO\nDESTROY ISIS THAT MINIMIZES ADVANTAGE TO IRAN, USING ARABS\nMORE.

ON THE FACE OF IT, INCREASING\nTHE NATIONAL DEBT THROUGH A FISCAL STIMULUS SHOULD BE\nSOFTENING. YIELDS HAVE GONE UP AND MAKES IT\nATTRACTIVE. WILL IT FLIP?\nWILL WE SEE DOLLAR WEAKNESS? >> FOR SURE.\nWE'VE NEVER SEEN CURRENCY MOVES THAT WE'VE SEEN.\nTHE PENDULUM HAS SWUNG TOO FAR IN THE SHORT RUN FOR THE DOLLAR\nAND PROBABLY, YOU KNOW, HAS GOTTEN TO A POINT WHERE IT'S\nMORE STRETCHED. MY GUESS IS THAT BACKS UP BEFORE\nANYTHING ELSE DOES. >> THE SELLOFF IN EMERGING\nMARKETS IS THAT JUSTIFIED OR DO YOU THINK AT THIS POINT IT'S\nOVERDONE. >> RISING RATES.\nCOMMODITIES COMING DOWN. VERY DEPENDENT ON SELLING U.S.\nSTRONGER DOLLAR. DOESN'T SET UP A VERY GOOD MENU\nFOR EMERGING MARKETS. AGAIN THAT TRADE PROBABLY HAS\nMORE LEGS TO IT. AS USUAL, THINK ABOUT THAT, OVER\nTHE NEXT 12 TO 18 MONTHS, WOULD THAT CONTINUE TO BE A NEGATIVE?\nYES. IT'S A VERY SIMPLE SHORT\nEMERGING MARKETS. >> WE SPOKE ABOUT THE\nREPOSITIONING GOING ON INCLUDING FINANCIALS HAVE BEEN THE BIGGEST\nBENEFICIARY. ANY OTHER SECTORS HAVEN'T\nREPOSITIONED SUFFICIENTLY ENOUGH FOR A TRUMP PRESIDENCY.\n>> FINANCIALS OBVIOUSLY THE FIRST AND FOREMOST AND HEALTH\nCARE. I THINK WHEN WE LOOK AT THE\nINDUSTRIALS WE'VE ONLY STARTED AT THE LARGE CAP.\nTHE INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX THROUGHOUT THE MID-CYCLE\nINDUSTRIAL COMPANIES WILL BENEFIT AND AGAIN THIS IS A\nGROUP THAT HASN'T BEEN ON FIRE. SO SOME THINGS I GET MORE\nCONCERNED ABOUT ON THE NEGATIVE SWHIED YOU -- SIDE, THAT'S\nGOTTEN AHEAD. TO THE EXTENT WE'RE TALKING\nABOUT SOME MASSIVE INFRASTRUCTURE SPEND OVER THE\nCOURSE OF THE NEXT TWO YEARS, I THINK THAT WE NEED TO\nDIFFERENTIATE WHO ACTUALLY GETS THAT MONEY.\nTHAT'S WHERE YOU'LL SEE MOST OF THE BARGAINS AND STOCKS THAT\nHAVEN'T LIFTED. >>  OUTSIDE OF THE REACSHOW IN\nTHE TECHNOLOGY SPACE, AMEND MARKET CAP LOST $35 BILLION\nSINCE THE ELECTION OUTCOME. IS THAT MOVE OVERDONE OR DO YOU\nTHINK IT'S NO SECRET THAT IS I LIE CONE VALLEY DOES NOT GET\nALONG AS WELL WITH A PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP AND\nHIS POLICIES ON TRADE AND IMMIGRATION.\nTHIS AS YOU WERE POINTING OUT THIS IS ONE PART OF THE MARKET\nWHERE WE'RE SEEING EARNINGS GROWTH.\n>> IT'S AMAZING THAT TRADE HAS PICKED UP.\nIT'S A DIFFICULT NARRATIVE TO SPELL OUT.\nYOU LAID THAT OUT NICELY BUT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?\nDO YOU THINK WE'LL GET IMMIGRATION POLICY THAT WILL\nNEGATIVELY IMPACT THEY COMPANIES AND GET TRADE POLICY THAT WILL\nNEGATIVELY IMPACT ALL OF US? IF THAT'S THE CASE IT'S NOT JUST\nTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES IT WILL BE BAD NECESSARILY FOR THE ENTIRE\nECONOMY. WE'RE SEEING IT FIRST IN SOME OF\nTHE BANK STOCKS. BUT WHAT WE'VE GOT THROUGH THE\nFIRST -- WHAT WE'VE BEEN FOUR, FIVE DAYS INTO THIS\nPRESIDENT-ELECT CYCLE. WE FOCUSED ON THE POSITIVES\nEXCEPT FOR THOSE FOUR OR FIVE STOCKS IN TECHNOLOGY.\nWE HAVEN'T REALLY CONSIDERED HOW TRADE POLICY, IMMIGRATION POLICY\nCAN NEGATIVE IMPACT.

VERY GOOD MORNING TO YOU.\nTHANK YOU FOR JOINING US. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MARKET\nRALLY. 2.3% WAS THE HIGH WE HIT ON THE\nTEN YEAR NOTE YESTERDAY. BACK TO 2.2%.\nIS THAT A REVERSAL OF THE TRENDS WE'VE SEEN SINCE TRUMP'S\nELECTION VICTORY AND WHAT DOES THAT SUGGEST TO YOU ABOUT U.S.\nEQUITIES? >> IT DOES SUGGEST WE FINISHED\nTHE INITIAL MOVE. TAKING TEN YEAR TREASURIES BACK\nTO WHERE WE WERE AROUND THE FOURTH QUARTER OF LAST YEAR.\nWE'VE BEEN AT THESE YIELD LEVELS BEFORE AS YOU MENTIONED IN THE\nLEAD. UP ABOUT 40, 45 BASIS POINTS OR\nSO IN THE LAST WEEK. I WOULD SAY THE INITIAL MOVE IS\nPROBABLY THERE. THE DATA NOW HAS TO START TO\nCOME IN AND WE NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE CLARITY ON WHAT THE ACTUAL\nPOLICIES WILL BE FROM A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.\nSO THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE EXPECTATION YOU'LL GET A LOT\nMUCH FISCAL POLICY, SOME IMPROVEMENT IN SHORT TERM GROWTH\nAND PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT MORE INFLATION DOWN THE LINE.\nMARKETS ARE REOR YERNTSING THEMSELVES TO THAT OUTCOME.\n>>  YOU SAY WE NOW NEED TO SEE THE DATA FIRST AND CLEARER\nPOLICY SECOND. DO YOU PUT THIS RALLY MORE DOWN\nDATA BASED EXPECTATIONS THAN TRUMP POLICY EXPECTATIONS?\n>> I DON'T THINK AT THIS POINT. OBVIOUSLY I THINK THE\nEXPECTATION THAT POLICY WILL CHANGE DRAMATICALLY.\nWE'RE WEIGHING HOW MUCH OF THAT IS ANTI-TRADE AND CONTRACTIONARY\nAND TAX CUTS AND SPENDING. THAT'S WHAT MARKETS ARE REACTING\nON. IN TERMS OF THE DATA, THE DATA\nIS OBVIOUSLY MORE ABOUT A RATE HIKE IN DECEMBER, FINANCIAL\nMARKET VOLATILITY IN THE NEAR TERM.\nWE'RE NOT GETTING A LOT OF THAT, A HIKE IN DECEMBER LOOKS VERY\nLIKELY. MARKET RESPONDS MUCH MORE ABOUT\nWHAT'S ANTICIPATED POLICY STANCE WHICH SHOULD COME IN PERHAPS\nEARLY '17 IF NOT THE SECOND HALF OF '17.\n>> SEEMS LIKE INVESTORS PICKING AND CHOOSING WHAT THEY WANT TO\nHEAR FROM THE PRESIDENT-ELECT FORKS CUSS ON FISCAL SPENDING\nAND LOWER FAXES, BUT OVERLOOKING THE PROTECTIONIST TRADE POLICIES\nTHAT DONALD TRUMP COULD POTENTIALLY BRING TO WASHINGTON\nAND ALSO THAT 45% TARIFF ON CHINESE GOODS.\nTHERE'S RESEARCH THAT SHOWS THAT COULD LEAD TO A 4.8 MILLION\nDECLINE IN AMERICAN JOBS. >> RIGHT.\nSO THE WAY TO LOOK -- THERE'S AN ANTI-TRADE COMPONENT TO HIS\nPOLICY PLANS. THIS IS ABOUT SIZING THE TWO.\nTHE UNDERLYING THEME IS TO REORIENT THE ECONOMY AWAY FROM\nTRADE TOWARDS MORE DOMESTIC PRODUCTION AND ACTIVITY.\nTHAT TYPE OF REALLOCATION IS TYPICALLY MESSY.\nIT'S ABOUT THE RELATIVE SIZE OF THESE.\nWE ASSUME YOU GET SOME ANTI-TRADE POLICIES.\nWE'VE DONE THAT THROUGH FORM OF HIGHER TARIFFS ON MEXICO AND\nCHINA GOODS NOT TO THE 45% AS YOU MENTIONED.\nBUT CHINA'S EXPORTS TO THE UNITED STATES GO GENERALLY RIGHT\nINTO THE CONSUMPTION BASKET. IT'S LIKE A TAX ON THE CONSUMER,\nHIGHER TARIFFS ARE A TAX ALSO ON BUSINESS.\nYOU NEED OFFSET THAT SOMEWHERE ELSE TO KEEP GROWTH ELEVATED.\nYOU DO THAT THROUGH A LARGE PERSONAL AND CORPORATE TAX CUT.\nIT'S ABOUT SIZING AND TIMING THOSE TWO COMPONENTS.\nOBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AROUND THAT AND I\nTHINK MARKETS ARE MAKING THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE FISCAL\nPACKAGE WILL DOMINATE ANY ANTI-TRADE POLICIES THAT COME\nOUT. >> THE MARKET NOW RESIGNED TO\nTHE FACT THAT ANY FISCAL PACKAGE WILL SEE THE NATIONAL DEBT AND\nTHE DEFICIT RISE AGAIN OR ARE PEOPLE EXPECTING THAT THIS IS\nGOING TO BE EFFICIENTLY DELIVERED AND BALANCED BY THE\nTRUMP ADMINISTRATION? I ASK BECAUSE I'M LOOKING FOR\nWHERE THE MARKET CAN SEE SOME SURPRISES AS WE GET INTO EARLY\nNEXT YEAR AND SEE SOME DISAPPOINTMENTS?\n>> OUR ASSUMPTION IS THE DEFICIT WILL GO WIDER AND BORROWING WILL\nINCREASE. WHERE THAT ENDS UP IN TERMS OF\nDEBT TO GDP RATIO WILL BE DEPENDENT ON WHERE NOMINAL GDP\nGROWTH GOES. BUT OUR ASSUMPTION IS THAT IT\nCAN'T REALLY BE OFFSET IN TERMS OF BEING DEFICIT NEUTRAL SO WE\nWOULD EXPECT THE DEFICIT TO GO FROM ITS CURRENT 3% OF GDP\nTOWARDS 5%, THE SIZE OF THE REVENUE PACKAGE WE ARE ASSUMING\nIS ABOUT 2% OF GDP IN TERMS OF REVENUES AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL\nFOR COMPARISON PURPOSES THE BUSH TAX CUTS WOULD BE 1.5%.\n2% WOULD STILL BE FAR LESS THAN INDEPENDENT ESTIMATES OF THE\nTRUMP PLAN WHICH WOULD PUT IT AT 4% TO 5%.\nWE THINK THAT'S A BRIDGE TOO FAR BUT 2% TO GDP WOULD BE A QUITE\nLARGE PROGRAM AND I DON'T SEE HOW YOU MAKE THAT DEFICIT\nNEUTRAL. >> MICHAEL THANKS VERY MUCH FOR\nJOINING US THIS MORNING.", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1479211053388.1479207752358.957e64d8-30af-4d22-9af0-06cf11163146.segment2.thumb.jpg", "channel": "355"}, {"start": 1066955, "length": 233170.0, "end": 1300125.0, "date": 1479207769566, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1479211008591.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1479207752358-957e64d8-30af-4d22-9af0-06cf11163146-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=1066.95,1300.12", "text": ">> WELCOME BACK TO \"WORLDWIDE\nEXCHANGE\".

WHY IS THAT AND NOW THAT WE'RE\nSEEING EXPECTATIONS AROUND 90% FOR A RATE HIKE IN DECEMBER OF\nALL THE BOND MOVES HAPPENED ALREADY?\n>> I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THAT BUT IT'S A GOOD POINT.\nWE HAD BIG SELLOFF IN TREASURIES.\nYIELDS ARE BACK TO WHERE THEY WERE A YEAR AGO.\nREALLY THE 2016 YIELDS THAT WERE ABNORMALLY LOW.\nALSO TRUE THAT MOST OF THE SELLOFF HAS BEEN WHAT WE THINK\nOF AS A TERM PREMIUM. THE FED REPRICING HAS BEEN\nPRETTY MODEST. WE EXPECT THE FED TO GO IN\nDECEMBER, PERHAPS TWO MORE HIKES NEXT YEAR.\nMOST OF THIS MOVE IS RESTORING A PREMIUM IN THE MARKET AND NOT\nPRICING AN AGGRESSIVE FED. >> YOU'RE SOUNDING LIKE THIS\nMOVE IS TOTALLY JUSTIFIED. IT'S BEEN I WOULD SAY A VERY\nSHARP CORRECTION. YOU THINK THIS IS A JUSTIFIED\nMOVE. >> THE FACT THAT IT OCCURRED IN\nA WEEK WAS OBVIOUSLY VERY NOTEWORTHY AND IF WE GET A LOT\nOF WEEKS LIKE THIS IT WOULD BE OF CONCERN.\nTREASURY INVESTORS HAVE NOT BEEN COMPENSATED FOR THE PAST SEVERAL\nYEARS FOR TAKING ON INTEREST RATE RISK.\nALSO THE MARKETS HAVE BEEN TOO RELAXED WE THINK ABOUT INFLATION\nOVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS AND RIGHT NOW THE REPRICING\nINDICATES MARKETS ARE EXPECTING ABOUT A 2% INFLATION RATE AND\nTHAT ALSO MAKES SENSE. >> THE OUTCOME OF THIS ELECTION,\nRICH HAS BROUGHT A DISCUSSION ABOUT MONETARY POLICY AND\nGEOPOLITICAL RISK. ARE THEY OVERLOOKING THE\nPOTENTIAL GEOPOLITICAL RISK THAT TRUMP BRINGS.\n>> GEOPOLITICAL RISK IS WITH US AND A VERY COMPLEX TIME.\nYOU'RE CORRECT SEEING MARKETS -- THE PENDULUM TENDS TO SWING BOTH\nWAYS OVER GEOPOLITICAL RISK. THAT'S A FACTOR.\nANOTHER FACTOR IS THAT WE'LL BE GETTING A FED CHAIRMAN BY EARLY\n2018. NOW WE'RE FOCUSED ON THE\nTRANSITION OF FISCAL POLICY BUT NEXT YEAR FOCUS ON WHO THE NEXT\nFED CHAIRMAN WILL BE. >> IS THAT A SIMPLE TRANSITION\nTO PERHAPS A SLIGHTLY MORE HAWKISH FED CHAIR AND THAT'S IT,\nVERY SIMPLE CHANGE OR IS THIS A MORE MEANINGFUL CHANGE, WE'LL\nSEE MORE POLITICAL INTERFERENCE, SOMEONE THAT DONALD TRUMP CAN\nSPEAK TO DAY-TO-DAY AND REALLY START TO LOSE THE INDEPENDENCE\nOF THE FED? >> WELL, I THINK THAT IS NOT A\nMAJOR RISK. I THINK TRANSITIONS BETWEEN FED\nCHAIRMEN ALWAYS GENERATE MARKET VOLATILITY AND LIKELY THAT\nWHOEVER PRESIDENT TRUMP APPOINTS WILL HAVE A SOMEWHAT MORE\nHAWKISH APPROACH TO MULTIPLE THAN WE'VE SEEN OUT OF THE\nYELLEN FED. I THINK THE YELLEN FED ON\nBALANCE HAS MADE THE RIGHT CALL BUT THE FOLKS THAT A PRESIDENT\nTRUMP MIGHT APPOINT WOULD HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW ABOUT THE PACE OF\nLIFTOFF. THAT'S THE MOST RELEVANT FACTOR.\n>> WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE FIRST RATE RISE HERE IN THE U.S..\n>> THE FED MEETS NEXT, IN THE SECOND WEEK OF DECEMBER.\nAND THE MARKETS ARE PRICING IN AT 90%.\nTHAT LOOKS ABOUT RIGHT. I THINK WE'LL GET A FED HIKE AT\nTHE DECEMBER MEETING. >> RICH, GREAT STUFF.\nTHANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING.\nPLEASURE AS ALWAYS.

IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THE YIELD\nTHAT ARE KICKING OFF. THEY'RE KICKING OFF DIVIDEND\nYIELDS ALONE. THESE THINGS TEND TO MAKE MONEY\nIN A FEW WAYS. SO THEY SELL THEIR PORTFOLIO\nPOSITIONS INTO THE MARKET AND THEY GET A PORTION OF THAT GAIN.\nTHAT'S NOT EVEN BEING DISAPPOINTED INTO THE FUTURE IN\nTERMS OF HOW MANY THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE.\nWE THINK THEY COULD HAVE EASILY DOUBLE DIGIT DIVIDENDS BEING\nKICKED OFF OVER THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS.\n>> SO IN THIS REGIME, THINGS GOT A LOT BETTER FOR THIS PARTICULAR\nGROUP? >> WELL, I MINE, CERTAINLY\nTHERE'S A CARRIED INTEREST TAX REFORM PROBABLY COMING.\nIT WILL BE TAXED AS INCOME. WE THINK THAT'S MORE THAN PRICED\nIN ALREADY. JUST THE GENERAL ECONOMIC\nENVIRONMENT. THE GROWTH TILT.\nTHESE THINGS SHOULD CONTINUE TO MAKE MONEY AS THEIR BUSINESSES\nCONTINUE TO GROW AND DO BETTER. >> THE -- BACK TO THE AIRLINES.\nWHAT IS THE MOST POSITIVE THING RIGHT NOW?\nBECAUSE WE LOVE TALKING ABOUT AIRLINES AND WHETHER THEY'RE --\nWHETHER IT'S A TOTALLY FREE MARKET.\nWHETHER THE GAINS ARE MAKING IN TERMS OF MARGINS AND\nPROFITABILITY. WHETHER THAT'S JUSTIFIED OR\nWHETHER IT'S SOMEHOW A FUNCTION OF SORT OF THE GOVERNMENT\nSCREWING UP THE ROOT SYSTEM AND WHO GETS THEM.\nI MEAN, IS IT TRULY AN OLIGOPOLY?\nIS IT NOT FAIR WHAT'S HAPPENING? >> IT'S CONSOLIDATED NOW TO\nWHERE THE TOP THREE AIRLINES, EACH HAVE 25% OF THE MARKET.\nYOU ADD SOUTHWEST, YOU'RE AT PROBABLY 85% OF THE MARKET.\nIT'S A COMMODITY BUSINESS, BUT THE INCENTIVE STRUCTURE -- BILL\nMENTIONED FOR NEW ENTRANCE AND THINGS LIKE THAT.\nBUT THE INTERNAL IS NOW BASED ON RETURN ON CAPITAL.\nTHE ECONOMY DOESN'T HAVE TO GET ANY BETTER.\nTHEY DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING DIFFERENT.\nDELTA HAS A 15% FREE CASH FIELD. RETURNING 75% OF FREE CASH FLOW\nTO HOLDERS. IS REALLY GOOD BECAUSE THEY'VE\nDONE POORLY UP UNTIL NOW. AND KWHAST INTERESTING IS THAT\nTHINGS THAT DRIVE AIRLINE STOCK PRICES IN THE TERM WHICH DELTA\nTHINKS WILL TURN POSITIVE. AND THEN GDP GROWTH WHICH HAS A\nHIGH CORRELATION WITH IT. GDP GROWTH IS GOING TO\nACCELERATE. YOU'VE GOT CHEAP STOCKS WITH\nCATALYSTS IN PLACE. >> I WON'T CALL HIM A DOG.\nWE SAID IN THE 6:00 HOUR WHO ARE THE WINNERS AND THE DOGS.\nIS THERE A SKUNK IN THERE? >> NO.\nI MEAN, SOMETHING LIKE HAWAIIAN IS EXPENSIVE COMPARED TO THE\nOTHER ONES. ALASKA IS A HIGH QUALITY NAME\nTHAT'S MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE OTHER ONES.\n>> BECAUSE THERE'S A TAKEOVER PREMIUM?\n>> WELL, WITH ALASKA IT'S JUST BECAUSE THEY'VE RUN THE BUSINESS\nSO WELL FOR SO LONG. BEEN ABLE TO LEARN ABOVE THE\nCOST OF CAPITAL. >> SO I WOULD -- I'VE ALWAYS\nARGUED THAT A VIBRANT AIRLINE INDUSTRY IS GOOD FOR EVERYONE.\nOBVIOUSLY IT'S GOOD FOR SHAREHOLDERS AND THINGS LIKE\nTHAT. IS IT GOOD FOR THE CONSUMER THAT\nTHEY'RE ABLE TO BE SO PROFITABLE.\n>> I THINK FARES ARE DOWN IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS.\n>> BUT NOT AS MUCH AS THEY WOULD BE IN A PURELY COMPETITIVE\nENVIRONMENT WHERE PEOPLE WOULD BE UNDERCUTTING IF EVERYONE\nCOULD COMPETE ON THE SAME ROOTS THEY'D BE CHEAPER.\nWHEN THEY DIDN'T MAKE MONEY FOR 20 YEARS.\nTHAT'S NOT GOOD EITHER. >> FOR A HUNDRED YEARS.\nYEAH. >> SO IT'S POSITIVE FOR SOCIETY\nOR SHOULD CONSUMERS -- >> IT'S AN EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE\nINDUSTRY AND THEY COMPETE ON INDIVIDUAL ROOTS, COMPETE\nINTERNATIONALLY.

IT HAS TO DO WITH LESS\nREGULATION AND HIGHER RATES. >> HE HAS A GREAT MOBILE APP.\n>> NOTHING HAS CHANGED. >> LISTEN, HE'S DONE A GOOD --\nHE'S CUT BACK COSTS.

I THINK A GROUP OF LARGE\nSHAREHOLDERS REALLY AND TRULY WERE FED UP WITH THE ANGER AND\nDON'T FEEL THAT IT'S FITTING WITH A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO\nLIKE TO ADVERTISE. SO IF THEY CAN CLEAN THIS UP AND\nBLOCK CERTAIN THINGS IN PEOPLE AND NOT HAVE A DECLINE IN THE\nNUMBER OF MONTHLY AVERAGE USERS AND MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE EASY\nTO ONBOARD, I THINK TWITTER WILL BECOME A TARGET AGAIN.\n>> YOU DO? >> OR THEY CAN GET IT UP\nTHEMSELVES.

I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED TO SEE\nSOME RETRENCHMENT BUT THE KEY VARIABLE HERE IS INFLATION.\nAS LONG AS INFLATION EXPECTATIONS ARE RISING, IT'S\nOUR VIEW THAT INTEREST RATES WILL KEEP MOVING HIGHER.\nWE HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN THE GROWTH OUTLOOK CHANGE THAT MUCH.\nIF REAL YIELD STARTS TO MOVE HIGHER, THAT'S OPTIMISTIC FOR\nRISK ASSETS. >> PERHAPS HIGHLIGHTING JUST HOW\nTHE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS IMPACTING GLOBAL ASSETS.\n>> I THINK WHAT'S MAYBE MORE INTERESTING AND MAYBE ERIN CAN\nSPEAK TO WHAT THE TRENDS LOOK LIKE HERE, THE AREAS OUTSIDE OF\nTHE CORE INFRASTRUCTURE PLAYS, OUTSIDE OF FINANCIALS, WE HAD A\nBETTER THAN EXPECTED RETAIL SALES NUMBER TODAY.\nTHE RETAIL STOCKS HAVE GONE PERKING UP AS WELL.\nMAYBE BECAUSE OF THE CONSUMER IS IN DECENT SHAPE, WE HAVE SOME\nINFLATION.

WHAT WOULD BE -- GIVE ME SOME\nEXAMPLES OF WHAT YOUR EXPECTATIONS WOULD BE THEN IN\nTERMS OF WHAT MIGHT BE ROLLED BACK AND HOW IT WILL BENEFIT\nYOUR BANKERS. >> I THINK SOME OF THE SMALL\nLENDING AND MORTGAGE REGULATIONS NEED TO BE PARED BACK FOR\nCOMMUNITY BANKS AND REGIONAL BANKS.\nI BELIEVE THERE WILL BE SOME SERIOUS MODIFICATIONS AT THE\nCONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU, SOME OF WHICH ARE BADLY\nNEEDED. I THINK THAT THE BANKING\nAGENCIES WILL RECEIVE NEW BANKING AGENCY HEADS, AND I\nTHINK THEY'LL BE MORE RECEPTIVE TO TAKING A SLOWER PACE ON JUST\nTHE SHEER AMOUNT OF REGULATIONS THAT THEY ISSUE AND OVERLOAD\nTHESE SMALLER BANKS WITH. >> CAMDEN, SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT\nTEARING UP DODD-FRANK WILL HELP THE LARGER BANKS, THE LARGER\nFINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS LIKE JPMORGAN MORE SO THEN THE\nREGIONAL SMALLER BANKS. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT?\n>> NO, I DON'T THINK SO. I DON'T SEE A TEARING UP OF\nDODD-FRANK. I SEE MAYBE MORE LIKE A REPEAL\nAND REPLACE OF DODD-FRANK OR LARGE PORTIONS OF IT.\nCHAIRMAN HINTERLING HAS INTRODUCED THE FINANCIAL CHOICE\nACT, WHICH IS HIS REPLACEMENT FOR DODD-FRANK, AND IT'S\nANYTHING BUT EASY ON THE WALL STREET BANKS.\nIT DOUBLES THE PENALTIES FOR WRONGDOING, IT REQUIRES HIGHER\nCAPITAL ACCOUNTS, LEVERAGE CAPITAL ACCOUNTS, SO I WOULDN'T\nSAY THAT THE CHOICE ACT GOES EASY ON WALL STREET.\n>> YOU'VE SAID IN THE PAST, CAM, THAT TRYING TO IMAGINE WHAT A\nTRUMP ADMINISTRATION WOULD DO DEPENDS ON THE PEOPLE HE\nSURROUNDS HIMSELF WITH.

I'M SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT\nRATES. I MEAN, WE TALK ABOUT WHAT'S\nGOING ON IN HOUSING. AT WHAT POINT, EVEN IF THEY'RE\nGOING UP FOR THE RIGHT REASON, DOES IT BECOME A PROBLEM?\n>> WE WON'T SEE THE DOLLAR INCREASE AS ABLEM IN\nHOUSING. IN THE SERVICEEC\nDOMESTIC ECONOMY, THE DOLLAR STRENGTH WON'T SHOW UP.\n>> SURE. >> WHERE IT WILL SHOW UP -- IT\nWILL SHOW UP IN IMPORTED GOODS. YOU WANT HIGH-PAYING JOBS.\nIT'S AN INDUSTRY WE COULD LOOK AT IN THE UNITED STATES.\nTHE DOLLAR SOURCE EMPORTED AUTOMOBILES TO THE UNITED STATES\nHOW MANY -- PRICED CHEAP ARE THAN WE CAN MANY OF IN THE\nUNITED STATES. WE DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN.\nWE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL. YOU CAN CONTINUE TO GROW JOBS IN\nTHE UNITED STATES. >> STOCKS HAVE DONE WELL.\nARE WE IN A NEW ENVIRONMENT WHERE BANKS CAN ACTUALLY DO WELL\nAGAIN? >> THE MARKET HAS BEEN LOOKING\nFOR CLARITY, AND IN AN UNCLEAR ENVIRONMENT PEOPLE DID NOT WANT\nTO OWN BANKS. I UNDERSTAND IT.\nYOU UNDERSTAND THAT. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE WERE\nLOOKING TO OWN ASSETS THAT THEY FELT THEY WERE PROTECTING IN AN\nUNCLEAR ENVIRONMENT. AS WE'RE STARTING TO CREATE MORE\nCLARITY AND PERCEIVE MORE CLARITY, PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO\nMIGRATE TOWARDS THIS ASSET CLASS THAT THEY THINK MAY BENEFIT IN\nMORE CLARITY. BANKS ARE ONE OF THOSE, AND\nTHERE'S ONE OF MANY AREAS WHERE THERE'S PERCEPTION THAT THERE\nMAY BE GREATER CLARITY AND IT'S AN ASSET CLASS THAT YOU WANT TO\nOWN. SO WE'RE STARTING TO SEE SOME\nROTATION OUT OF SOME TECHNOLOGY NAMES WHERE PEOPLE WERE\nCOMFORTABLE OWNING THEM. INTO BANKS NAMES.\nINTO INDUSTRIAL NAMES. THE TRUTH IS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE\nTO WAIT AND SEE TO WHAT WE ACTUALLY END UP WITH AND WHAT WE\nGET IN THE FUTURE. >> GOLDMAN SPECIFIC.\nHOW DO YOU THINK THE BANK FAIRS UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP.\nYOU MADE A CAMEO IN CANDIDATE TRUMP'S CLOSING ARGUMENT, IF YOU\nWILL, BS AND NOT IN A GOOD WAY. ARE YOU IN THE CROSSHAIRS, OR\nARE YOU IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE YOU THINK YOU CAN THRIVE?\n>> LOOK, I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF GOLDMAN SACHS.\nI THINK WE'RE IN A GREAT POSITION TO SERVE OUR CLIENTS.\nAS WE GET GREATER TRANSPARENCY AND GREATER CLARITY OF WHAT THE\nENVIRONMENT IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE, WHAT THE ECONOMY IS GOING\nTO LOOK LIKE, AND WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE GLOBAL WORLD OUR\nCLIENTS ARE GOING TO BE MORE PROPELLED TO DO DIFFERENT\nTHINGS. THAT'S BEEN GOOD FOR OUR\nBUSINESS, GOOD FOR OUR FRANCHISE.\n>> ABOUT REGULATION. IF SOME REGULATION GOES AWAY, DO\nYOU THINK DODD FRANK SHOULD GO AWAY?\n>> REMEMBER WHERE BANKS ARE. BANKS ARE FINANCIAL -- WE SIT\nTHERE AND WE ARE THE TRANSMISSION MECHANISM BETWEEN\nCENTRAL BANKS ON ONE HAND AND MAIN STREET ON THE OTHER HAND.\nAS CENTRAL BANKS TRY TO FLOOD THE MARKET WITH LIQUIDITY, WE\nNEED TO BE ABLE TO TRANSMIT THAT INTO MAIN STREET OR WE NEED TO\nBE ABLE TO TRANSMIT IT INTO ENTREPRENEURS OR WE NEED TO\nTRANSMIT IT INTO SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZE COMPANIES.\nI DO THINK THAT PART OF THE REGULATION WE'VE GONE THROUGH\nHAS HAMPERED OUR ABILITY TO TRANSMIT THAT CAPITAL INTO\nENTREPRENEURS IN THE SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZE BUSINESSES.\nWE KNOW THAT SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZE BUSINESSES AND\nENTREPRENEURS, THEY CREATE THE JOBS IN AMERICA.\nOUR ABILITY TO TRANSMIT MORE CAPITAL INTO THOSE PARTS OF THE\nECONOMY, WE THINK THAT'S VERY, VERY GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY AND\nECONOMIC GROWTH. ON THE OTHER HAND, REMEMBER THAT\nTHE U.S. BANKS TODAY ARE THE STRONGEST BANKS IN THE WORLD.\nWE'RE THE MOST HIGHLY CAPITALIZED BANKS.\nWE HAVE THE LOWEST LEVERAGE RATIOS, AND I THINK THAT'S A\nHUGE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE FOR THE U.S. BANKS.\nI DON'T WANT TO LOSE THAT. >> LET'S BRING IT FULL CIRCLE\nBACK TO THE ELECTION AND PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP. DO YOU KNOW HIM?\nHOW DO YOU THINK HE WOULD DO IN THAT ROLE IF, IN FACT, HE IS\nCHOSEN? >> I KNOW STEVE WELL.\nWE WERE IN THE SAME PARTNER CLASS IN 1994.\nWE WORKED TOGETHER IN THE MANAGEMENT TEAM OF THE FIXED\nINCOME DIVISION UNTIL HE LEFT GOLDMAN SACHS.\nSTEVE IS A GREAT PERSON. HE IS A GREAT MIND.\nLOOK, I'M GLAD THAT HE IS BEING CONSIDERED.\n>> YOU THINK HE WOULD DO A GOOD JOB IF HE IS SELECTED?\n>> I THINK THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS TO DECIDE IF\nHE IS GOING TO DO A GREAT JOB. >> I APPRECIATE THE TIME VERY\nMUCH. >> MY PLEASURE.\n>> ALL RIGHT. GARY COHN, GOLDMAN SACHS, HE IS\nTHE PRESIDENT AND THE COO. WITH US FOR THE HOUR FROM CNBC\nHEADQUARTERS TODAY AS WELL, WE HAVE JOE TERRA NOVA, JOHN\nNAJARIAN, PETE NAJARIAN AS WELL. GUYS, YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON\nSOME OF WHAT YOU HEARD FROM MR. COHN?\n>> IT WAS A GREAT INTERVIEW, FIRST OF ALL, SCOTT, AND YOU\nKNOW, REALLY I THINK THE QUESTION BECOMES AS GARY\nMENTIONED, THE FINANCIALS AND WHAT YOU DO RIGHT NOW WITH THE\nFINANCIALS. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, IT'S BEEN\nTHE RUSSELL THAT HAS BEEN RALLYING, AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT\nTHE COMPOSITION OF THE RUSSELL, 27% OF THE WEIGHTING IS TO\nFINANCIAL SERVICES. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU PLAY THE\nFINANCIALS THROUGH THE RUSSELL. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU DO YOUR\nHEDGING THROUGH THE RUSSELL. IT CERTAINLY EXPLAINS THE MOVE\nTHAT WE WITNESSED 9% HIGHER IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.\n>> THE >> THE STEEPENING YIELD CURVE,\nTHAT'S ALL THE STUFF THAT GARY WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT AS WELL.\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT, SCOTT, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT\nWE'RE SEEING, I THINK, IN THE OPGS MARKET, THE DERIVATIVE\nMARKETS HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT PAPER THAT CONTINUES TO GO INTO\nTHE BANKS. FROM EVERYBODY FROM BANK OF\nAMERICA. WE TALKED ABOUT IT JUST BEFORE\nTHE ELECTION. THE 95,000 CALLS THAT WERE BEING\nBOUGHT IN BANK OF AMERICA. WE'LL GIVE YOU ONE TODAY.\nON MARCH. YOU GO OUT TO MARCH IN THE XLF.\nYOU ARE GETTING THE WHOLE BANKING SECTOR.\nYOU LOOK AT THAT, AND SUDDENLY THE 23 STRIKE.\n300,000 CALLS HAVE BEEN PURCHASED TODAY.\nGIVES YOU A LITTLE BIT OF AN IDEA.\nON A DOWN DAY, PEOPLE STILL WANT TO BE INVOLVED.\nIT TELLS ME THE BANKS WILL BE FOR A WHILE.\n>> WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF PAPER, JUDGE, OBVIOUSLY, IN GARY'S\nSTOCK IN GOLDMAN SACHS ITSELF. AS THE STOCK IS UP, LIKE, 18%.\nI THINK SINCE THE ELECTION. ACCESS INTO AND OUT OF FIXED\nINCOME TRADES. I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE HUGE\nFOR THE NEXT THREE TO SIX MONTHS.\n>> GUYS, WE'LL BE BACK WITH YOU IN JU A BIT.\nWANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT A INTERVIEW WE HAVE COMING UP\nTOMORROW ON \"THE HALFTIME REPORT.\"\nONE OF THE TOP INVESTORS IN THE TRAVEL SPACE.\nBRAD GERSTNER WILL BE WITH US. HE IS THE FOUNDER AND CEO OF\nALTIMETER CAPITAL.

JOHN, THE OTHER DAY I CALLED\nBONDS THE VEGETABLES OF INVESTING, KIND OF BORING, YOU\nDON'T -- YOU NEED TO HAVE THEM IN YOUR PORTFOLIO.\nBUT LIKE VEGETABLES, THERE IS ALL KINDS, SO IT IS HARD TO SAY\nTHE BOND MARKET. ARE THERE ANY PARTICULAR PARTS\nOF THE BOND MARKET, JOHN THAT YOU THINK ARE EXTREMELY OVER OR\nEXTREMELY UNDERVALUED NOW. >> I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T CALL THE\nLAST FEW DAYS BORING IN THE BOND MARKET.\nI DON'T KNOW IF THE VEGETABLES REALLY WORKS FOR THE LAST FEW\nDAYS. I THINK LET ME START BY SAYING\nWHAT HAS HAPPENED IS WE HAVE SEEN MORE OPTIMISM ON GROWTH IN\nTHE U.S. AND INFLATION IN THE U.S. OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS.\nTHAT SHOULD ALLOW THE FED TO GET NOT ONLY A HIKE IN DECEMBER,\nWHICH IS FULLY PRICED, BUT ALSO A FEW HIKES NEXT YEAR AND WE'LL\nSEE WHERE IT GOES. I THINK THAT AN ENVIRONMENT OF\nHIGHER GROWTH, HIGHER INFLATION AND THE FED FOLLOWING THROUGH,\nYOU WOULD EXPECT TO SEE HIGHER YIELDS, ESPECIALLY ON THE FRONT\nEND OF THE CURVE AND WE HAVE SEEN THAT.\n>> HOW HIGH? >> I THINK WE'RE CERTAINLY\nPRICING IN MORE FED THAN WE WERE A WEEK AGO.\nSO THE FED WENT FROM ONE HIKE TO NOW CLOSER THAN TWO.\nAND WE'LL SEE WHERE IT GOES. I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF RISKS\nIN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTATION. BUT I THINK MOST OF THAT, AND\nTHIS IS WHAT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE, MOST OF THAT IS A\nFRONT END OF THE YIELD CURVE STORY.\nAGAINST THAT, I HIGHLIGHT TWO THINGS THAT WE THINK ARE FAIRLY\nPOSITIVE IN THE BOND MARKET. THE FIRST IS CREDIT.\nTHE SURPRISE THAT WE HAVE SEEN AS RICK SAID WAS BETTER OPTIMISM\nON GROWTH, MORE PRO BUSINESS, AND PERHAPS MORE REGULATORY\nRELIEF. THAT SHOULD BE POSITIVE FOR\nCREDIT AND SO YOU'VE SEEN BANK  WELL.\nOTHER SPREAD SECTORS DO QUITE WELL.\nTHAT'S A REAL POSITIVE. THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY,\nYOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THE YIELD CURVE, THAT FIVE-YEAR YIELD,\nTHAT COULD BE GOING HIGHER. BUT THE BACK END OF THE CURVE,\nWHICH REFLECTS THE MORE MEDIUM TERM PROSPECTS, SLOWER GROWTH\nOVER THE MEDIUM TERM AND AGING  HAS CHANGED.\nTHERE MAY BE VALUE IN THE LONG END OF THE CURVE, EVEN AS THE\nFED -- >> MAYBE THAT ONE COULD BUY AT\nTHIS POINT. BILL MILLER HAS ACTUALLY BEEN\nSAYING THIS FOR SOME TIME, TO SAY IT NOW, THIS MORNING, AFTER\nWE ALREADY HAVE SEEN THIS BIG MOVE IN RATES, PEOPLE THINK HE'S\nARMCHAIR QUARTER BABYING BUT AT DELIVERING ALPHA, ONE WAS LONG\nVALUE AND SHORT TREASURIES. WOULD YOU DO THAT NOW?\n>> WE WOULD NOT. FOR US, THE BETTER TRADE IS TO\nHAVE THOSE CREDIT EXPOSURES IN YOUR PORTFOLIO AND THEN AGAINST\nTHAT, HAVE SOME DIVERSIFICATION, THAT LONG END OF THE YIELD\nCURVE. BONDS AND CREDIT TEND TO MOVE IN\nOPPOSITE DIRECTIONS. YOU'VE SEEN THAT OVER THE LAST\nWEEK OR SO. CREDIT HIGHER, BOND PRICES\nLOWER. THAT NEGATIVE CORRELATION IS A\nPOSITIVE TOOL, REALLY IMPORTANT TOOL FOR PORTFOLIOS, FOR\nPORTFOLIO MANAGERS. THERE IS A TRADE THERE, WHERE\nOWN CREDIT, HAVE SOME OF THE RISK IN THE PORTFOLIO AND HAVE\nTHE DIVERSITY AND INTEREST RATE RISK, ESPECIALLY IN THE LONG END\nRIGHT NOW. >> WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE\nINDIVIDUAL INVESTOR WHO HAS PUT A LOT OF MONEY INTO BOND FUNDS\nOVER THE PAST FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE, TEN YEARS,\nWHATEVER. WHO NOW ARE SEEING A DIFFERENT\nKIND OF MARKET UNFOLD IN FRONT OF THEM.\nWHAT DO THEY NEED TO DO? WHAT DO THEY NEED TO BE READY\nFOR? BECAUSE THE BOND MARKET TREATED\nTHEM PRETTY WELL. >> YOU KNOW, IT HASN'T -- OUR\nMESSAGE TO -- INVESTORS, RETAIL AND NOT, IS TO GO BACK TO THE\nFUNDAMENTALS. WHERE DO YOU THINK GROWTH IS\nGOING TO BE, WHERE DO YOU THINK INFLATION IS GOING TO BE.\nAS I SAID, WE HAVE SEEN A MATERIAL CHANGE IN EXPECTATIONS\nOVER THE NEXT ONE OR TWO YEARS. GROWTH A LITTLE FASTER, LOOSER\nFISCAL ER INFLATION.\nBUT IT IS IMPORTANT NOT TO JUST THINK ABOUT ONE OR TWO YEARS BUT\nWHERE DO YOU THINK GROWTH DEMOGRAPHICS, PRODUCTIVITY ARE\nGOING OVER THE MEDIUM TERM. IF YOU GET COMFORTABLE WITH THE\nIDEA, THERE IS STILL A LOT OF HEAD WINDS, WE HAVEN'T FULLY\nCHANGED REGIMES HERE, I THINK THERE IS VALUE IN HOLDING A BOND\nPOSITION AGAINST A CREDIT POSITION.\n>> JOHN, WE'LL LEAVE IT THERE.

SO MANY WERE SO COMFORTABLE\nTRYING TO WEAVE TOGETHER NARRATIVES WHERE THERE WAS A LOT\nMORE HELIUM THAN THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE.\nONE THING THAT NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT THAT IS COMMON DOWN HERE\nAND IT IS TOUGH TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE EVERYBODY IS LOOKING\nFORWARD, WE HAVE A TWO-TERM PRESIDENT THAT DEFINITELY DIDN'T\nSEEM TO BE VERY PRO WALL STREET.

I DON'T THINK WE WILL GET ALL OF\nTHESE HELPINGS ALL AT ONCE. I'M OPTIMISTIC THERE IS PENT UP\nDEMAND AND INVESTMENT THAT CAN'T BE MADE AND FUNDS TO FUND IT.\nWE'LL HAVE TO SEE THE DETAILS BUT AT THIS POINT I WOULD BE\nSURPRISED IF THIS DOESN'T CONTINUE IN FITS.\n>> IT WAS INTERESTING WHERE THEY OUTLINE A NUMBER OF INDUSTRIES\nTHEY ARE WORKING IN AND WAYS THEY THINK TRUMP'S POLICIES CAN\nHELP TO ACCELERATE PROGRESS.

THAT HAD THE BUSINESS CYCLE KICK\nIN AND THE STOCK MARKET SOLD OFF 20% BEFORE TURNING AROUND IN\nAUGUST OF '82 AND PROCEEDING TO DOUBLE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL\nYEARS. >> RICK, THE ROLE OF THE FED\nCOMES INTO PLAY WE ARE TALKING ABOUT TWO VERY, VERY DIFFERENT\nECONOMIC PERIODS, HIGH INFLATION AT THAT TIME AND VERY, VERY HIGH\nINTEREST RATES IN THE EARLY '80s.\nTHE FED IS GOING TO PLAY A ROLE IN THIS IN THE EARLY DAYS.\n>> I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO PLAY A MUCH SMALLER ROLE THAN\nTHEY HAVE THE LAST 7 1/2 YEARS. THAT IS PART OF THE MAGIC OF\nTHIS MOVE. ART IS A SMART GUY.\nI TRADED FIXED INCOME MARKET AND ONE THING I DO REMEMBER THAT\nGOES ALONG WITH HIS DESCRIPTION IS YOU KNOW THE SUPPLY SIDE\nSEEDED A LOT OF DEFICITS FOR A WHILE AND THOSE ARE GOING TO BE\nISSUES WITH SOME PROGRAMS THAT DONALD TRUMP IS TALKING ABOUT\nWITH REGARD TO INFRASTRUCTURE. I KNOW HE WANTS TO FINANCE IT IN\nCREATIVE WAYS. OF COURSE, UNLIKE THOSE YEARS\nTHE DEFICIT LEVELS ARE VERY HIGH ESPECIALLY AS PERCENTAGES OF\nGDP. THAT COULD PUT DRIZZLE ON THE\nPARTY BUT I REALLY DO THINK WE ARE TAKING OUR FOOT OFF OF SO\nMANY ISSUES THAT JUST WEREN'T A VERY FERTILE LANDSCAPE FOR\nBUSINESS.

WHAT IS THE ANSWER?\n>> IS -- AS A GUY HOLDING THE FAMILY TOGETHER AND BETTING ON\nTHE NFL, BARELY HOLD THE FAMILY TOGETHER.\nTHE MAIN PROBLEM IS KAEPERNICK.\nPEOPLE ARE SICK OF SEEING AMERICA GET [PLEA] OFF.\nPEOPLE ARE TIRED OF APOLOGIZING FOR MARK AND THE\nTHINGS AMERICA DOES RIGHT. I DO THINK KAEPERNICK TO BE A\nEXTEND TAU PELLED -- PROPELLED THEM FORWARD.\nTHERE -- THEY SATURATED THE PRODUCT.\nIT IS EVERY NIGHT. SUNDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL IS ONLY\n12 YEARS OLD. AND THEN IT WAS THURSDAY NIGHT\nFOOTBALL AND NOW IN DECEMBER THEY HAVE SATURDAY FOOTBALL.\nTHERE IS JUST TOO MUCH FOOTBALL.\n>> THAT'S THE ANSWER. >> THERE IS TOO MUCH\nFOOTBALL. YOU HAVE TO TURN IT OUT A\nLITTLE BIT. >> 13 OF THE TEAMS IN THE NFL\nHAVE WINNING RECORDS. MOST OF THE NFL SUCKS.\nAND THAT'S THE PROBLEM. WHY ARE YOU GOING TO THEN TAKE\nOUT THREE HOURS OF YOUR SUNDAY AFTERNOON OR THURSDAY NIGHT\nAND MONDAY NIGHT -- ALTHOUGH MONDAY NIGHT PROBABLY DOES\nBETTER THAN MOST TO WATCH BAD FOOTBALL WILL THE MATCH UPS\nYOU ARE HAVING ARE NOT GOING TO ATTRACT THE COMPETITION.\nFOR ALL OF THE REASONS WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AND YOU ADD\nTHAT ONE RIGHT THERE, THAT'S A BIG REASON.\nTHE FACT I DON'T HAVE THE EXCITING FOOTBALL SUNDAY AND\nTHAT'S ALL YOU WILL DO. YOU HAVE COLLEGE FOOTBALL.\nSATURDAY IS THE ONLY DAY YOU CAN ENJOY COLLEGE FOOTBALL.\nIT IS A LOT MORE EXCITING. >> MONDAY WAS A MECCA.\nTHERE WAS SUNDAY AND MONDAY WAS THE PRIME TIME GAME.\nTHERE WAS A MONDAY NIGHT GAME THAT ENDED IN A 6-6 TIE.\nTHIS IS IN EUROPE. WE DON'T DO TIES.\nYESTERDAY THE JETS LOST 9-6. THESE ARE UNWATCHABLE GAMES.\nYOU CAN'T WATCH A GAME WHERE NOBODY SCORES A TOUCHDOWN.\n>> MAYBE IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH KAEPERNICK.\n>> AND MAYBE AS SOMEBODY THAT WORKED FOR SEVEN YEARS AT ESPN\nI FEEL QUALIFIED TO WEIGH IN. I WOULD LIKE TO LOOK AT THE\nSTATISTICS. 46% OF GAMES IN THE LAST FEW\nYEARS WERE DECIDED BY SEVEN POINTS OR LESS.\nI PROPOSE SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY, BUT WHAT IF WE\nPUT MORE EMPHASIS ON FIELD GOALS.\nSTARTING AT THE 50 YARD LINE IT GETS FOUR POINTS AND 60\nYARDS YOU GET FIVE AND THEN 75 YARDS OR LONGER IT CAN ONLY BE\nIN THE SECOND HALF YOU WIN THE GAME.\n>> WE ARE NOT WATCHING FOR FIELD GOALS.\n>> I DIDN'T DISAGREE WITH YOU IN THE FACT THE FOOTBALL\nENTHUSIASM IS DEAD WILL I WILL SIT MYSELF DOWN EVERY SUNDAY\nAND WATCH THE GAMES WHILE I AM DOING WORK.\n>> >> THIS ISN'T BASED ON A\nMETRIC? >> I AM SAYING FOOTBALL IS\nEXCITING, BUT WE NEED TO UP THE ANNIE.\n>> WE WANT TO GO TO THE NEXT STORY.\nWHAT IS BIGGER THAN THE NFL? >> IF YOU THINK OUR\nPOLITICIANS ACTED POORLY REMEMBER THIS.\nIT COULD BE WORSE. >> WAY BETTER THAN --\n>> DON'T TELL ME THAT WAS BETTER THAN FOOTBALL.\n>> THEY INSINUATED HE WAS WORKING WITH THE RUSSIAN\nGOVERNMENT. I THINK HE LEARNED HIS\nLESSON. THERE IS NO WAY HE WILL SAY IT\nAGAIN. >> I WAS MISTAKEN.\nPERHAPS THE MOST IMPRESSIVE PART IS THIS GUY IN THE\nCORNER. WATCH HOW UNPHASED HE IS BY\nANYTHING THAT IS HAPPENING. WATCH THIS.\nNOTHING. >> I THINK THAT GUY IS COOL.\nHE SHOULD BE THE PRIME MILE-PER-HOUR SISTER.\n>> HE SHOULD HAVE PUT HIM THROUGH TIBBLE.\n>> CSPAN TAKE NOTICE. DO YOU WANT RATINGS?\n>> THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS A LOT IN UKRAINE AND IN CERTAIN\nPARTS OF THE WORLD THEY ARE ALWAYS BRAWLING.\nMAYBE WE NEED AGENTS OF THAT. >> THE ONE GUY WAS TRYING TO\nMAKE A POINT WHY NFL RATINGS WERE DOWN AND THE OTHER GUY\nMOVED TO THE NEXT STORY.
