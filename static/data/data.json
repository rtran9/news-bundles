              "text": "HEALTH, AND NOT SO MUCH ON\nDONALD TRUMP. WHAT WE ARE LEARNING HERE IS\nTHAT WHENEVER THE NEWS IS FOCUSED ON ONE PARTICULAR\nCANDIDATE, IT'S BAD FOR THAT CANDIDATE.\nIN THE PAST, IT'S BEEN FOCUSED A LOT ON DONALD TRUMP.\nTHE MORE HE HAS SMALL MOMENTS RATHER THAN BIG MOMENTS AND\nBEFORE HE CAN HAVE THOSE LITTLE MOMENTS LIKE IN THE CHURCH, BUT\nWITHOUT COMING BACK AND TRYING TO BACK PEDAL WHAT ACTUALLY\nHAPPENED AND JUST LET IT GO, THE MORE HE CAN LET THESE THINGS GO,\nTHE BETTER HE SEEMS TO BE DOING IN THE POLLS.\nWHAT I'M SEEING IN POLLING RIGHT NOW SUGGESTS THAT IT'S MORE A\nSENSE OF WELL, DONALD TRUMP ISN'T AS MUCH OF A BUFFOON OR\nCLOWN OR SOMEBODY WHO IS JUST NOT FIT FOR OFFICE AS WE HAVE\nBEEN LED TO BELIEVE. THE MORE HE CAN DO THAT, I THINK\nWE WILL SEE HIS POLL NUMBERS IMPROVE.\n>> SPECIFICALLY WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE QUINNIPIAC POLL WHICH\nSHOWS THE RACE TIGHTENING BUT THE SAME POLL SHOWS PEOPLE ARE\nVOTING AGAINST A CANDIDATE RATHER THAN FOR A CANDIDATE.\nSO WILL DISLIKE DRIVE PEOPLE TO THE POLLS?\n>> WELL, IT'S CERTAINLY A HOBSON'S CHOICE THE VOTERS ARE\nFACING THIS YEAR. WHETHER OR NOT THAT WILL DRIVE\nTHEM TO THE POLLS I THINK REMAINS TO BE SEEN.\nIT'S STILL A LITTLE TOO EARLY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TURNOUT'S GOING\nTO LOOK LIKE. BUT MY SENSE IS THAT IT'S MUCH\nMORE DIFFICULT TO GET PEOPLE TO THE POLLS IF THEY'RE NOT VOTING\nFOR, POSITIVELY FOR SOMEONE, THAN IT IS TO GET THEM TO COME\nOUT AND VOTE AGAINST SOMEBODY. I DON'T THINK THAT PARTICULARLY\nTHE VOTING GROUPS THAT ARE LESS LIKELY TO SHOW UP, IN PARTICULAR\nYOUNGER VOTERS, ARE GOING TO COME OUT IN THE NUMBERS WE HAVE\nSEEN IN RECENT YEARS, MAINLY BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ANYBODY\nTHAT THEY ARE VOTING FOR. THEY ARE JUST VOTING AGAINST.\n>> GOT YOU. ALSO, I WANT TO POINT THIS OUT,\nPATRICK, BECAUSE THE POLLS ARE ONE THING.\nTHE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS ANOTHER THING, RIGHT?\nSO AS OF TODAY, THE CURRENT CNN BATTLEGROUND MAP GIVES HILLARY\nCLINTON 273 ELECTORAL VOTES FROM STATES SOLIDLY OR LEANING HER\nDIRECTION, TO TRUMP'S 191 VOTES. SO IF THE ELECTION WERE HELD\nTODAY DESPITE WHAT THE POLLS SHOW, HILLARY CLINTON WOULD WIN\nAND SHE WOULD WIN EVEN IF MR. TRUMP WINS OHIO, FLORIDA AND\nNEVADA. HE KIND OF HAS TO FLIP A LEANING\nDEMOCRATIC STATE, DOESN'T HE, TO GET ENOUGH ELECTORAL VOTES TO\nWIN? >> YEAH.\nTHE MAP IS -- HAS ALWAYS BEEN STACKED AGAINST HIM.\nWHAT WE ARE SEEING IS HIM BUILDING HIS SUPPORT IN SOME OF\nTHOSE KEY STATES LIKE OUR NEVADA POLL YESTERDAY SHOWED A FLIP\nFROM WHAT WE HAD A COUPLE MONTHS AGO WHERE WE HAD CLINTON IN THE\nLEAD. NOW WE HAVE DONALD TRUMP, WITHIN\nTHE MARGIN OF ERROR BUT STILL, MOMENTUM GOING IN HIS DIRECTION.\nWE HAVE A POLL COMING OUT IN IOWA TODAY THAT WILL SHOW\nSOMETHING VERY SIMILAR THERE. IF HE CAN CONTINUE TO BUILD THAT\nMOMENTUM AND HAVE IT SPREAD INTO PLACES LIKE OHIO AND THEN\nPENNSYLVANIA OR EVEN NEW HAMPSHIRE, THAT COULD BE ENOUGH\nTO FLIP THIS MAP. >> SO MY FINAL QUESTION TO YOU,\nANDY. HOW MUCH FAITH SHOULD WE PUT IN\nTHESE POLLS AT THE MOMENT? >> AS A POLLSTER, I WILL SAY THE\nMOST DIFFICULT THING IN DOING ELECTION POLLING IS TO FIGURE\nOUT WHO'S GOING TO SHOW UP ON ELECTION DAY.\nWE SIMPLY DON'T KNOW YET WHAT THAT ELECTORATE WILL LOOK LIKE.\nA LOT OF THE PEOPLE WE ARE SEEING IN BOTH THE QUINNIPIAC\nPOLLS AND OTHER POLLS DON'T LIKE EITHER CANDIDATE.\nAS WE GET CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE ELECTION I THINK YOU WILL\nSEE BOTH PARTIES KIND OF LOCK DOWN THEIR SUPPORTERS.\nBUT IT'S THOSE LESS ENGAGED VOTERS, MORE INDEPENDENT VOTERS,\nTHAT ARE LESS LIKELY TO SHOW UP. IF THIS REALLY DEVOLVES INTO A\nFOOD FIGHT OF A CAMPAIGN EVEN MORE THAN IT ALREADY IS, I THINK\nWE WILL SEE LOWER TURNOUT AND THAT'S GOING TO BE HARD TO\nPREDICT WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW. >> ALL RIGHT.\nTHANKS SO MUCH FOR STOPPING BY. >>> HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD\nTRUMP FACE OFF ON THE SAME STAGE IN THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL\nDEBATE. WE WILL HAVE LIVE COVERAGE\nMONDAY, SEPTEMBER 26 RIGHT HERE ON CNN.\n>>> STILL TO COME, SHE WAS CAUGHT IN A BOMB ATTACK, PULLED\nFROM THE RUBBLE AND LIVED TO TELL THE TALE.\nUP NEXT, THE YOUNG SYRIAN'S HEART-WRENCHING STORY OF\nSURVIVAL.",

IN THE PRIMARY SAW A BARRAGE OF\nINSULTS FROM DONALD TRUMP, WATCH.\n>> FIRST OF ALL THIS GUY IS A CHOKE ARTIST AND THIS GUY IS A\nLIAR. >> YOU'RE TOUGH.\n>> WE NEED A LEADER. >> YOU'RE TOUGH.\nI'M AT 42 AND YOU'RE AT 3. >> DOESN'T MATTER.\n>> SO FAR DOING BETTER. >> NEVER ATTACKED HIM ON HIS\nLOOK AND BELIEVE ME, PLENTY OF SUBJECT MATTER RIGHT THERE.\nTHAT I CAN TELL YOU. >> SORRY.\nHE BEAT OUT 16 OTHER CANDIDATES USING THIS TACTIC.\nDO YOU THINK IT'S WINNING FORMULA HE SHOULD DO AGAIN ANDY?\n>> I THINK TRUMP IS ONE OF THE BEST COUNTERPUNCHERS I'VE SEEN.\nH'ES NOT THE FIRST GO ON THE ATTACK BUT WILL DESTROY HIS\nOPPONENT. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DEBATES IF\nHILLARY GOES AFTER HIM, I WISH HER LUCK.\n>> HOW DOES SHE FIGHT BACK? >> SUBSTANCE AND POLICY.\nEVERYONE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THE SHOWMAN THAT DONALD TRUMP IS AND\nHOW HE DOES WITH AUDIENCE. THE FACT IS DONALD TRUMP NEVER\nDONE THIS DAY BEFORE IN HIS LIFE.\nON STAGE ONE ON ONE HAVING A DEBATE ABOUT SUBSTANCE WITH\nPROFESSIONAL MODERATORS THERE. ENTIRE WORLD WATCHING.\nNEVER DONE IT BEFORE. HILLARY CLINTON HAS.\nWHAT PEOPLE ALSO DON'T KNOW IS THE ADDED ADVANTAGE HILLARY\nCLINTON HAS IS SHE'S A WOMAN. DONALD TRUMP HAS NEVER BEEN ON\nSTAGE WITH A WOMAN STANDING TOE-TO-TOE AND TELL HIM HE'S\nWRONG AND HAVE MORE DEPTH ON DOMESTIC POLICY THAN HE DOES.\nCAN HE'S GOING TO BE SO FAR OUT OF WATER THAT HE'S GOING TO BE\nUNCOMFORTABLE. I DON'T THINK DO WELL IN THE\nFIRST ONE. MAYBE AFTER.\n>> EXCEPT THE LADY IN THE CHURCH.\n>> THAT WAS TELLING. >> THERE'S A NEW POLL SAYING\nTHREE POINTS AHEAD IN FLORIDA. HOW DID TRUMP TURN THIS AROUND?\n>> HE STAYED ON MESSAGE. THE THEME TO THE SEGMENT WAS THE\nINSULT COMIC ROUTINE. OF HE'S DONALD TRUMP THAT BE\nSTICKING TO THE SCRIPT. HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN TALKING\nABOUT THE BASKET OF DEPLORABLES. HER NUMBERS HAVE SUFFERED\nBECAUSE OF IT. I THINK DONALD TRUMP SHOULD\nCONTINUE WHAT HE'S DOING. THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE, NOT JUST\nTHE NATIONAL NUMBERS IS GETTING BETTER FOR TRUMP BY THE DAY.\nI SAY KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING.\n>> THERE'S A NEW POLL THAT SHOWS DONALD TRUMP AHEAD OF HILLARY\nCLINTON. SHE WAS AHEAD BY FOUR POINTS IN\nJULY. SHE WAS WAY UP THERE.\nYOU WERE WORRIED THAT PEOPLE WOULDN'T REALIZE HOW CLOSE THIS\nRACE COULD GET. ARE YOU WORRIED NOW FOR A\nTOTALLY DIFFERENT REASON? >> NO.\nI CONTINUE TO BE WORRIED, AND I HOPE THAT THE HILLARY CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN, I KNOW THE HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS WORRIED.\nTHEY NEED TO WAKE UP EVERY DAY WORRIED AND RUN AS IF SHE'S TEN\nPOINTS BEHIND. I'VE SAID THIS REPEATEDLY ON\nYOUR SHOW. IT'S THE ONLY WAY THEY GET TO\nTHE POINT OF NOT JUST MAKING SURE HILLARY CLINTON IS OUT\nTHERE THE WAY SHE'S BEEN DOING, UNDERSCORING THE MESSAGE SHE'S\nTHE ONE WITH THE SUBSTANCE AND THE ONE WITH THE KNOWLEDGE AND\nTHE EXPERIENCE, THE STEELY STEADINESS, AND THE TEMPERAMENT\nTO BE COMMANDER IN CHIEF VERSUS THE JOKE THAT HAS BECOME DONALD\nTRUMP. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, TO MAKE\nSURE THAT DEMOCRATS, INDEPENDENTS, AND SANE MINDED\nREPUBLICANS WHO UNDERSTAND WHAT A DANGER THIS MAN WOULD BE\nANYWHERE CLOSE TO THE OVAL OFFICE WITH HIS HANDS ON THE\nNUCLEAR CODES DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO MAKE SURE THEY GET OUT\nAND VOTE AND THEIR FAMILIES AND FRIENDS GET OUT AND VOTE.\nFOR THE OBAMA COALITION, I THINK THIS IS GOOD, BECAUSE IT WILL\nMOBILIZE THEM. AND I ACTUALLY THINK THAT THE\nLAST COUPLE DAYS HAVE HURT HER. SHE'S BEEN OFF THE TRAIL.\nYOU KNOW, IN TERMS OF ACTUAL WORRY, THESE POLLS, I DON'T BUY\nTHE FLORIDA OR NEVADA POLL UNLESS YOU'RE POLLING WITH\nBILINGUAL POLLSTERS, YOU'RE SUPPORT AMONG LATINO VOTERS IS\nNOT SHOWING UP. THAT'S THE CASE WITH OTHER\nMINORITY POPULATIONS AS WELL. I'M GLAD IT'S GETTING CLOSER.\n>> YOU HAVE A SIMILAR THEORY ABOUT THE POLLS, DON'T YOU?\n>> YEAH. I THINK SOME OF THE THINGS\nYOU'VE BEEN SAYING AND THE CNN POLLS IS I THINK THAT POLLSTERS\nARE PROJECTING THE ELECTORATE TO BE WIDER.\nIT'S SOMETHING THAT HASN'T HAPPENED IN DECADES.\nI THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE MODEL, EVEN THE MODEL IN 2008\nHAVE YOU HAD EXTREMELY HIGH AFRICAN AMERICAN AND HISPANIC\nTURNOUT, IN 2012 IT WAS HIGHER. AFRICAN AMERICANS AND HISPANIC\nAMERICANS STARTED TO PARTICIPATE AT HIGHER RATES.\nTHE NUMBERS, YOU SHOULDN'T SEE THE POLLS RETROGRESZ.\nTHEY SHOULD INCREASE. >> GO AHEAD, ANDY.\n>> NOW THAT TRUMP IS LEADING OR WINNING IN MOST OF THE SWING\nSTATES AND NATIONALLY, THE PUNDITS NOW HAVE A PROBLEM WITH\nTHE METHODOLOGY OF THE POLLS. WE KNEW THIS WAS COMING.\n>> I'VE ALWAYS HAD THIS ISSUE. >> HE'S NOT WINNING NATIONALLY.\nTHE CNN POLL WAS AN OUTLIER. AND IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT THE E\nLELECTORAL COLLEGE, IF YOU GIVE HIM OHIO AND NORTH CAROLINA, YOU\nKNOW WHAT HAPPENS ON NOVEMBER 8TH?\nYOU'RE STILL SAYING MADAM PRESIDENT.\nI THINK -- >> BUT FLORIDA, AND REMEMBER,\nTRUMP DID WELL WITH LATINOS IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY, BEATING\nTHE HOME STATE SENATOR. >> THAT'S NOT SAYING A LOT.\nSORRY. >> HE WON BY 18 POINTS.\n>> THAT'S NOT SAYING A WHOLE LOT.\n>> I HAVE TEN SECONDS IN. >> THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT SAYS\nTHAT THE OBAMA COALITION IS GOING TO TURN OUT IN THE SAME OR\nSIMILAR NUMBERS WITH HILLARY CLINTON.\n>> THAT'S WHY THE PRESIDENT IS OUT THERE.\n>> FUNDAMENTALLY -- >> THANK YOU, GUYS.\nTHAT'S IT FOR US TONIGHT.

              "text": ">>> TWO MONTHS UNTIL ELECTION\nDAY, AND RECENT POLLS SHOW DONALD TRUMP LEADING IN OHIO AND\nFLORIDA. CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT LOOKS\nAT THE NUMBERS. >> TWO CNN POLLS, TWO\nBATTLEGROUND STATES, DONALD TRUMP HAS MOMENTUM FOR\nPRESIDENT. IN THE STATE OF OHIO, NO\nREPUBLICAN WINS WITHOUT IT. DONALD TRUMP MUST WIN OHIO, AT\nTHE MOMENT, HE'S UP FIVE POINTS, 46% TO 41% FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHE THIRD-PARTY CANDIDATES GETTING A COMBINED TEN.\nWHY IS THIS HAPPENING? HERE'S ONE REASON, IN OTHER\nBATTLEGROUND STATES HILLARY CLINTON HAS BENEFITED BY WINNING\nAMONG COLLEGE-EDUCATED VOTERS. IN OHIO,\nDONALD TRUMP HAS A LEAD AND HE'S TROUNCING HILLARY CLINTON AMONG\nWHITE CLASS WORKING VOTERS. HILLARY CLINTON IS LOSING THESE\nVOTERS. IT IS A PLUS FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nHILLARY CLINTON NEEDS A GENDER GAP AND NEEDS TO WIN IT UP BIG\nWITH WOMEN VOTERS BECAUSE THE REPUBLICAN USUALLY WINS AMONG\nMEN. ONLY A TWO-POINT ADVANTAGE FOR\nSECRETARY CLINTON IN THIS OHIO POLL WITH WOMEN.\nTHAT'S A PROBLEM FOR HER. LET'S MOVE SOUTH TO THE BIGGEST\nBATTLEGROUND IN TERMS OF ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES, 29,\nFLORIDA, AND THE NUMBERS LOOK SIMILAR.\nTHIS ONE'S A LITTLE BIT TIGHTER INSIDE THE MARGIN OF ERROR, 44%\n-- 37% FOR TRUMP, AND 44 FOR CLINTON.\nTHIS IS THE CLOSEST RACE BETWEEN SINCE 2012 BETWEEN OBAMA AND\nROMNEY. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THIS\nEDUCATION GAP WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER BATTLEGROUND STATES,\nNOT LIKE HERE IN FLORIDA. DONALD TRUMP WINNING AMONG WHITE\nCOLLEGE GRADUATES AND TROUNCING WHITE COLLEGE EDUCATED VOTERS.\nONE OTHER POINT, HILLARY CLINTON IS THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE\nTRYING TO SUCCEED A TWO-TERM DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT.\nIF THE PRESIDENT'S DISAPPROVAL RATING IS A MAJORITY AS IT IS IN\nOHIO AND FLORIDA -- THEY DON'T LIKE THE PRESIDENT SO MUCH.\nHE IS UNDER WATER IN POLITICS, IN OTHER STATES WE'VE\nSEEN THE PRESIDENT ABOVE 50%, SHE DOES BETTER SO THE OBAMA\nMATTERS, AS WELL. SO POLLS IN OHIO, HOW DO THEY\nEFFECT THE ELECTORAL MAP, IF THE ELECTION WERE TODAY, SECRETARY\nCLINTON WOULD WIN. DARK BLUE IS SOLID DEMOCRAT.\nSO IF DONALD TRUMP WON FLORIDA AND OHIO, BASED ON THOSE NEW\nPOLLS, THERE'S NEW POLL SHOWING HIM WINNING IN NEVADA, EVEN THAT\nWOULD NOT BE ENOUGH FOR DONALD TRUMP TO WIN THE UPON\nPRESIDENCY, HE HAS TO TURN ONE OF THOSE BLUE STATES RED.\nVIRGINIA, MICHIGAN, PENNSYLVANIA, WATCH IF\nWE SEE MORE STATE POLLING. LOOK FOR THOSE GENDER NUMBERS.\nLOOK FOR THOSE EDUCATION NUMBERS.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS MOMENTUM, NOT QUITE ENOUGH.\n>> JOHN KING, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT.\nI WANT TO BRING IN OUR CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST, GLORIA\nBORGER, AND SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST, DAVID GERGEN.\nAND MARK PRESIDENT -- MARK PRESTON.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYONE. HOW WORRIED, GLORIA, SHOULD\nHILLARY CLINTON BE ABOUT THESE BATTLEGROUND NUMBERS?\n>> WORRIED. AND I THINK THEY ARE WORRIED\nABOUT THEM. SHE HAD A BIG BOUNCE COMING OUT\nOF HER CONVENTION. IT'S CLEAR EVAPORATED MORE OR\nLESS, AND BATTLEGROUND STATES TEND TO RISE AND FALL TOGETHER\nAND SHE'S HAVING A LITTLE PROBLEM WITH THEM RIGHT NOW.\nI WAS LOOKING AT SOME OF THE INTERNALS IN THE POLL NUMBERS\nJOHN WAS TALKING ABOUT IN FLORIDA AND OHIO.\nWHAT STRUCK ME WAS HOW BEHIND SHE WAS COMPARED TO BARACK OBAMA\nIN 2012 WITH YOUNGER VOTERS. SHE'S 13 POINTS BEHIND WHERE HE\nWAS IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA. THAT'S A LOT.\n>> AND THAT HELPED HIM WIN. >> IT REALLY HELPED HIM WIN.\nSHE NEEDS TO GET BERNIE SANDERS OUT THERE ON THE TRAIL, HELPING\nHER WITH THOSE YOUNGER VOTERS. THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY\nIMPORTANT TO HER. >> ON THE DOUBLE.\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NATIONAL POLLS, MARK, AND CNN'S POLL\nSHOWING OHIO AND FLORIDA TRUMP LEADS, SHE'S LOST A LOT OF\nGROUND SINCE THE CONVENTION. DONALD TRUMP, HE CLEARLY HAS THE\nMOMENTUM NOW. >> WELL, YES AND NOW.\nHE HAS THE MOMENTUM WHERE HE HAS KIND OF STABILIZED WHERE HE IS\nAT. SHE HAS REALLY DROPPED.\n SHE WAS UP EIGHT COMING UP OUT OF THE CONVENTION NATIONALLY,\nAND THAT TRACKED WITH THE BATTLEGROUND STATES BUT WHAT\nWE'RE SEEING AND NOT ONLY IN OUR TWO POLLS, IN IOWA AND NEVADA,\nTHAT ARE NOT GOOD AT ALL FOR HILLARY CLINTON AT THIS POINT,\nIT'S ALL TRENDING RIGHT NOW, AND WHILE THERE'S 55 DAYS LEFT, AND\nCLEARLY WHAT WE SAW FROM JOHN RIGHT THERE, SHE WOULD WIN TODAY\nGIVEN THE ELECTORAL MAP, THE TREND IS NOT GOING HER WAY.\n>> ARE WE SEEING PEOPLE WHO YOU KNOW WERE MAYBE A LITTLE BIT\nADVERSE TO DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T SO SURE ABOUT HIM\nAND NOW HE'S SORT OF APPEARS TO HAVE STABILIZED WITH THIS NEW\nTEAM, THAT THESE ARE REPUBLICANS WHO ARE COMING ON BOARD SAYING\nOKAY MAYBE WE CAN -- >> I THINK WE'RE SEEING A\nNATURAL COMING TOGETHER OF A REPUBLICAN PARTY THAT HAS BEEN\nINCREDIBLY FRACTURED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE YEAR.\n>> DAVID, CLINTON HAS HAD A ROUGH FEW WEEKS SINCE TRUMP\nCHANGED HIS CAMPAIGN TEAM. HE'S BEEN POUNDING HER ON THE\nFOUNDATION, THE E-MAILS, LARGELY AVOIDING MAKING MAJOR MISTAKES\nAND SHE HAD THIS DEPLORABLES COMMENT AND THE PNEUMONIA\nEPISODE. WHAT DOES SHE NEED TO DO TO TURN\nTHIS AROUND? AND CAN SHE?\n>> WIN THE FIRST DEBATE. EVERYTHING IS GOING TO COME TO\nTHAT DEBATE. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME\nBACK-AND-FORTH'ING OVER THE NEXT 12 DAYS OR SO.\nTHAT FIRST DEBATE BECOMES ALL IMPORTANT.\nA COUPLE THINGS, DON. IN THE BACKGROUND HERE, IS THAT\nAS YOU SAY, HE'S RUNNING A MUCH MORE DISCIPLINED AND SMARTER\nCAMPAIGN, MORE INTERESTING EVENTS THAN WHAT HE'S HAD IN THE\nPAST, AND I THINK THAT HAS HELPED HIM.\nBUT ALSO, THIS -- BOTH CANDIDATES HAVE ALLOWED THIS\nCAMPAIGN TO DRIFT OVER AND CENTER ON THE QUESTION AMONG THE\nPOPULOUS, WHICH ONE DO YOU TRUST MORE?\nWHICH ONE DO YOU LIKE MORE AND THAT'S THE BASIS ON WHICH YOU'RE\nGOING TO VOTE. SHE COULD EASILY LOSE THAT\nQUESTION. WHAT SHE CAN WIN ON IS WHO IS\nGOING TO DO MORE FOR THE COUNTRY WHO HAS AN AGENDA FOR THE FUTURE\nBOTH HOME AND ABROAD THAT'S GOING TO MAKE\nYOU MORE SAFER AND PROSPEROUS. SHE HAS A BETTER CHANCE OF\nWINNING THAT ON THE SUBSTANCE THAN ON THE LIKABILITY\nSITUATION. >> DONALD TRUMP HAD A RALLY AND\nTALKED ABOUT CLINTON'S HEALTH. LISTEN TO THIS.\n>> DO YOU THINK THIS IS EASY? OH, YOU THINK THIS IS SO EASY?\nIN THIS BEAUTIFUL ROOM THAT'S 122 DEGREES?\nIT IS HOT AND IT'S ALWAYS HOT WHEN I PERFORM BECAUSE THE\nCROWDS ARE SO BIG. I DON'T KNOW, FOLKS.\nYOU THINK HILLARY WOULD BE ABLE TO STAND UP HERE FOR AN HOUR AND\nDO THIS? I DON'T KNOW.\nI DON'T KNOW. I DON'T THINK SO.\nI DON'T THINK SO. >> NOT A GOOD LOOK, GLORIA?\n>> NOT A GOOD LOOK. FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T THINK IT'S\nEVER A GREAT IDEA TO COMPLAIN TO THE VOTERS HOW TOUGH YOUR JOB\nIS WHEN YOU RUN FOR PRESIDENT, I THINK THAT'S WHAT HE WAS\nDOING. SAYING KIND OF LIKE I DON'T NEED\nTHIS, BUT IT'S 100 DEGREES AND THIS IS REALLY HARD ON ME.\n>> HE'S ACTUALLY SAID I DON'T",

CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT LOOKS\nAT THE NUMBERS. >> TWO CNN POLLS, TWO\nBATTLEGROUND STATES, DONALD TRUMP HAS MOMENTUM FOR\nPRESIDENT. IN THE STATE OF OHIO, NO\nREPUBLICAN WINS WITHOUT IT. DONALD TRUMP MUST WIN OHIO, AT\nTHE MOMENT, HE'S UP FIVE POINTS, 46% TO 41% FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHE THIRD-PARTY CANDIDATES GETTING A COMBINED TEN.\nWHY IS THIS HAPPENING? HERE'S ONE REASON, IN OTHER\nBATTLEGROUND STATES HILLARY CLINTON HAS BENEFITED BY WINNING\nAMONG COLLEGE-EDUCATED VOTERS. DONALD TRUMP HAS A LEAD AND HE'S\nTROUNSING HILLARY CLINTON AMONG WHITE CLASS WORKING VOTERS.\nONE INTERESTING POINT IN OHIO, HILLARY CLINTON NEEDS A GENDER\nGAP AND NEEDS TO WIN IT UP BIG WITH WOMEN VOTERS BECAUSE THE\nREPUBLICAN USUALLY WINS AMONG MEN.\nONLY A TWO-POINT ADVANTAGE FOR SECRETARY CLINTON IN THIS OHIO\nPOLL, THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR HER. LET'S MOVE SOUTH TO THE BIGGEST\nBATTLEGROUND IN TERMS OF ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES, 29,\nFLORIDA, AND THE NUMBERS LOOK SIMILAR.\nTHIS ONE'S A LITTLE BIT TIGHTER INSIDE THE MARGIN OF ERROR, 44%\nFOR TRUMP AND 47% FOR CLINTON. THIS IS THE CLOSEST RACE BETWEEN\nOBAMA AND ROMNEY AND IF YOU LOOK AT THIS EDUCATION GAP WE'VE SEEN\nIN OTHER BATTLEGROUND STATES, NOT LIKE HERE IN FLORIDA.\nDONALD TRUMP WINNING AMONG WHITE COLLEGE GRADUATES AND TROUNCING\nWHITE COLLEGE EDUCATED VOTERS. ONE OTHER POINT, HILLARY CLINTON\nIS THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE TRYING TO SUCCEED A TWO-TERM\nDEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT. IF THE PRESIDENT'S DISAPPROVAL\nRATING IS LIKE OHIO AND AUTHORIZE, HE'S UNDER WATER IN\nPOLITICS, IN OTHER STATES WE'VE SEEN THE PRESIDENT ABOVE 50%,\nSHE DOES BETTER SO THE OBAMA MATTERS, AS WELL.\nSO POLLS IN OHIO, HOW DO THEY EFFECT THE ELECTORAL MAP, IF THE\nELECTION WERE TODAY, SECRETARY CLINTON WOULD WIN.\nDARK BLUE IS SOLID DEMOCRAT. SO IF DONALD TRUMP WON FLORIDA\nAND OHIO, BASED ON THOSE NEW POLLS, THERE'S NEW POLL SHOWING\nHIM WINNING IN NEVADA, EVEN THAT WOULD NOT BE ENOUGH FOR DONALD\nTRUMP TO WIN THE UPON PRESIDENCY, HE HAS TO TURN ONE\nOF THOSE BLUE STATES RED. MICHIGAN, PENNSYLVANIA, WATCH IF\nB WE SEE MORE STATEPOLLING.\nLOOK FOR THOSE GENDER NUMBERS. DONALD TRUMP HAS MOMENTUM, NOT\nQUITE ENOUGH. >> JOHN KING, THANK YOU VERY\nMUCH FOR THAT. I WANT TO BRING IN OUR CHIEF\nPOLITICAL ANALYST, GLORIA BORGER, AND SENIOR POLITICAL\nANALYST, DAVID GERGIN. THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYONE.\nHOW WORRIED, GLORIA, SHOULD HILLARY CLINTON BE ABOUT THESE\nBATTLEGROUND NUMBERS? >> WORRIED.\nAND I THINK THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT THEM.\nSHE HAD A BIG BOUNCE COMING OUT OF HER CONVENTION.\nIT'S CLEAR EVAPORATED MORE OR LESS, AND BATTLEGROUND STATES\nTEND TO RISE AND FALL TOGETHER AND SHE'S HAVING A LITTLE\nPROBLEM WITH THEM RIGHT NOW. I WAS LOOKING AT SOME OF THE\nINTERNALS IN THE POLL NUMBERS JOHN WAS TALKING ABOUT IN\nFLORIDA AND OHIO. WHAT STRUCK ME WAS HOW BEHIND\nSHE WAS COMPARED TO BARACK OBAMA WITH YOUNGER VOTERS.\nSHE'S 13 POINTS BEHIND WHERE HE WAS IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA.\nTHAT'S A LOT. >> AND THAT HELPED HIM WIN.\n>> IT REALLY HELPED HIM WIN. SHE NEEDS TO GET BERNIE SANDERS\nOUT THERE ON THE TRAIL, HELPING HER WITH THOSE YOUNGER VOTERS.\n>> ON THE DOUBLE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NATIONAL\nPOLLS, MARK, AND CNN'S POLL SHOWING OHIO AND FLORIDA TRUMP\nLEADS, SHE'LOST A LOT OF GROUND. SHE'S KIND OF STABILIZED WHERE\nHE'S AT. SHE HAS REALLY DROPPED.\n>> SHE WAS UP EIGHT COMING UP OUT OF THE CONVENTION\nNATIONALLY, AND THAT TRACKED WITH THE BATTLEGROUND STATES BUT\nWHAT WE'RE SEEING AND NOT ONLY IN OUR TWO POLLS, IN IOWA AND\nNEVADA, THAT ARE NOT GOOD AT ALL FOR HILLARY CLINTON AT THIS\nPOINT, IT'S ALL TRENDING RIGHT NOW, AND WHILE THERE'S 55 DAYS\nLEFT, AND CLEARLY WHAT WE SAW FROM JOHN RIGHT THERE, SHE WOULD\nWIN TODAY GIVEN THE ELECTORAL MAP, THE TREND IS NOT GOING HER\nWAY. >> ARE WE SEEING PEOPLE WHO YOU\nKNOW WERE MAYBE A LITTLE BIT ADVERSE TO DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE\nTHEY WEREN'T SO SURE ABOUT HIM AND NOW HE'S SORT OF APPEARS TO\nHAVE STABILIZED WITH THIS NEW TEAM, THAT THESE ARE REPUBLICANS\nWHO ARE COMING ON BOARD SAYING OKAY MAYBE WE CAN --\n>> I THINK WE'RE SEEING A NATURAL COMING TOGETHER OF A\nREPUBLICAN PARTY THAT HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY FRACTURED THROUGHOUT\nTHE WHOLE YEAR. >> DAVID, CLINTON HAS HAD A\nROUGH FEW WEEKS SINCE TRUMP CHANGED HIS CAMPAIGN TEAM.\nHE'S BEEN POUNDING HER ON THE FOUNDATION, THE E-MAILS, LARGELY\nAVOIDING MAKING MAJOR MISTAKES AND SHE HAD THIS DEPLORABLES\nCOMMENT AND THE PNEUMONIA EPI\nEPISODE, WHAT AND CAN SHE DO TO TURN THIS AROUND?\n>> WIN THE FIRST DEBATE. EVERYTHING IS GOING TO COME TO\nTHAT DEBATE. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME BACK\nAND FORTHING OVER THE NEXT 12 DAYS OR SO.\nTHAT FIRST DEBATE BECOMES ALL IMPORTANT.\nIN THE BACKGROUND HERE, IS THAT AS YOU SAY, HE'S RUNNING A MUCH\nMORE DISCIPLINED AND SMARTER CAMPAIGN, MORE INTERESTING\nEVENTS THAN WHAT HE'S HAD IN THE PAST, AND I THINK THAT HAS\nHELPED HIM. BUT ALSO, THIS -- BOTH\nCANDIDATES HAVE ALLOWED THIS CAMPAIGN TO DRIFT OVER AND\nCENTER ON THE QUESTION AMONG THE POPULOUS, WHICH ONE DO YOU TRUST\nMORE? WHICH ONE DO YOU LIKE MORE AND\nTHAT'S THE BASIS ON WHICH YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE.\nSHE COULD EASILY LOSE THAT QUESTION.\nWHAT SHE CAN WIN ON IS WHO IS GOING TO DO MORE FOR THE COUNTRY\nAND WHO HAS AN AGENDA AT HOME",

EXACTLY RIGHT.\nGO AHEAD, MOLLY. >> THESE POLLS ARE ALSO IN\nRACES WHERE YOU ARE SEEING A MICROCOSM OF THE OVERALL\nRACE. THESE ISSUES ARE REALLY\nIMPORTANT TO VOTERS. THEY ARE NOT BEING DISCUSSED\nAS MUCH IN THE NATIONAL MEDIA WHICH WANTS TO TALK\nABOUT OTHER ISSUES. WHEN YOU LOOK AT\nIMMIGRATION, ECONOMIC SECURITY, NATIONAL SECURITY,\nTHESE ARE THINGS THAT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT, VOTERS IN NEVADA\nAND VOTERS IN OHIO CARE ABOUT.\nYOU ARE SEEING THAT SHIFT IN THE POLLS AS PEOPLE -- AS\nTHE UNDERLYING FUNDAMENTALS OF THE RACE CONTINUE TO BE\nABOUT THINGS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE\nNATIONAL CONVERSATION IS. >> AND ALSO THE -- I MEAN,\nIF YOU LOOK AT THE NATIONAL NUMBERS, A MONTH AGO HILLARY\nCLINTON HAD AN 8 POINT LEAD IN THE REAL CLEAR POLITICS\nAVERAGE OF POLLS.

I CAN SEE AN ARGUMENT THAT\nAMERICANS DON'T CARE TOO MUCH ABOUT THE HEALTH OF THESE\nCANDIDATES. >> AND THEY SHOULD BE CAREFUL IN\nTHE CLINTON CAMP, RIGHT?

JASON RUSSELL, I PROMISED YOU WE\nARE GOING TO BE GETTING NEWS OUT OF THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IN ABOUT\nFIVE MINUTES OR SO. IN FACT, I HAVE THE NEWS HERE,\nAND YOU DO NOT WANT TO LEAVE.

ONE IS THE REPORT AND THE OTHER\nIS FROM LENNOX HILL HOSPITAL. >> MAY I SEE THEM?\n>> YEAH, SURE. >> NOW, OF COURSE, ALL OF THIS\nCOMES AS THERE IS A MUCH BIGGER FOCUS ON TRANSPARENCY IN TERMS\nOF THE HEALTH OF BOTH OF THOSE CANDIDATES AND WHILE DONALD\nTRUMP HAS BEEN TAKING A RESPECTFUL TONE WHEN IT COMES TO\nNAVIGATING HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH ISSUES AT THE 9/11\nSERVICE, HE COULDN'T AVOID GETTING IN A DIG WHEN HE WAS\nCAMPAIGNING IN OHIO LAST NIGHT TAKING A SWIPE AT HILLARY\nCLINTON'S STAMINA. >> YOU THINK THIS IS SO EASY.\nIN THIS BEAUTIFUL ROOM THAT IS 122 DEGREES.\nI DON'T KNOW, FOLKS, DO YOU THINK HILLARY WOULD BE ABLE IS\nTO STAND UP HERE FOR AN HOUR AND DO IT?\nI DON'T THINK SO. >> STILL GOING TO BE RELATIVELY\nLIMITED INFORMATION, NOT A COMPLETE MEDICAL HISTORY LIKE\nWE'VE SEEN PREVIOUS NOMINEES PROVIDE.\nTHEY DON'T FEEL THE NEED TO RELEASE MUCH MORE BEYOND THAT.\nTRUMP SWITCHING GEARS ENTIRELY AND HERE AT THE WARDOLF\nHISTORIA. HOW HE IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE\nMANY PLANS HE RUPPROPOSED. >> THANKS FOR THAT REPORTING.\nLET'S DISCUSS EVERYTHING WE LEARNED WITH MARK PRESTON,\n\"WASHINGTON POST\" POLITICAL REPORTER AND DR. SANJAY GUPTA.\nGREAT TO HAVE ALL OF YOU HERE. THERE IS POLITICS AND HEALTH.\nLET ME START WITH YOU, SANJAY, ABOUT HER HEALTH.\nTWO-PAGE LETTER THAT HILLARY CLINTON'S DOCTOR RELEASED.\nFILLED WITH LAB RESULTS AND THE VITAMINS SHE'S ON AND WHAT SHE'S\nNOT DEFICIENT IN. WHAT DID YOU SEE IN READING THIS\nLETTER? >> FIRST OF ALL, IT'S A LETTER.\nIT'S NOT MEDICAL RECORDS. ALL THIS TALK WHETHER MEDICAL\nRECORDS ARE GOING TO BE RELEASED.\nNEITHER ONE HAD MEDICAL RECORDS RELEASED.\nTHE BIGGER THING WAS A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT HAPPENED TO\nTHE RECENT HEALTH EPISODE. THE PNEUMONIA.\nSHE GOT A C.A.T. SCAN TO DIAGNOSE THAT AND PUT ON\nANTIBIOTICS. TEN DAYS OF AN ANTIBIOTIC KNOWN\nAS LEVIQUIN. THROUGHOUT THE YEAR SHE HAD\nSEVERAL SCANS. CT SCAN OF HER SINUSES AND BRAIN\nAND CT SCAN OF HER LUNGS. >> BECAUSE SHE HAS SEASONAL\nALLERGIES AND SISINUSITIS. SOMETIMES YOU'LL DO THAT AND THE\nBRAIN SHOWED NO ABNORMALITIES WHICH IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE GOING\nBACK TO 2012 THERE WAS ALL THESE QUESTIONS WAS THERE SOME SORT OF\nINJURY TO THE BRAIN. THE CT HAS REPORTED NO EVIDENCE\nOF ABNORMALITIES. >> YOU'RE SATISFIED WITH THIS\nLETTER? >> WE'RE READING A SUMMARY OF\nSOMEONE'S INTERPRETATION OF ALL THE MEDICAL RECORDS.\n>> WHAT DO WE USUALLY GET? WHAT ARE WE COMPARING THIS TO AS\nA STANDARD? >> THIS IS TYPICALLY WHAT WE\nGET. IN 2008 JOHN McCAIN RELEASED HIS\nMEDICAL RECORDS ABOUT 1,000 PAGES AND I GOT A CHANCE TO LOOK\nAT THOSE, BUT, TYPICALLY, IT'S A LETTER LIKE THIS AND SOME TYPE\nOF SUMMARY BY A PHYSICIAN WHO HAS BEEN TREATING THE PERSON FOR\nA LONG TIME. >> HOW IS THIS PLAYING\nPOLITICALLY IN TERMS OF WHO LOOKS KN IN THIS AND WHO\nDOESN'T? >> SORT OF HARD TO SAY.\nI LIKE TO LOOK AT THE POLL NUMBERS AND THERE REALLY ISN'T\nPOLLING ON THIS YET. HOW MUCH INFORMATION WE EXPECT\nFROM OUR CANDIDATES. ONE THING THAT WE'RE SEEING OR\nBEING REINFORCED HERE IS A PARTISAN INTERPRETATION TO THAT.\nPEOPLE WHO LIKE DONALD TRUMP THINK HE HAS GIVEN ENOUGH\nINFORMATION ON HIS TAXES AND ENOUGH INFORMATION IN GENERAL\nAND PEOPLE FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHE QUESTION THAT IS REALLY INTERESTING UNDERCUTTING ALL\nTHIS IS WHAT IS THE STANDARD? SHOULD WE GIVE THOUSANDS OF\nPAGES OR IS A LETTER OF A SUMMARY ENOUGH?\nWHETHER SUCH A LETTER IS ENOUGH, PARTICULARLY WHEN THERE IS AN\nACUTE INCIDENT THAT HAPPENS. BUT, I THINK THAT MOSTLY VOTERS\nARE GOING TO LOOK AT THIS THROUGH THE LENS AT WHICH THEY\nLOOK AT THE CANDIDATES, EITHER POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY.\n>> HILLARY HAS THIS DOCTOR WHO, BY ALL ACCOUNTS, IS A REAL\nDOCTOR. TRUMP GOES ON DR. OZ AND, ONCE\nAGAIN, USES HIS DR. BORSTEIN. HE IS CONTROVERSIAL BY ANY\nMEASURE AND HE WROTE A LETTER THAT WAS RIDICULOUS THE FIRST\nTIME PUTTING OUT HIS FINDINGS. SO, THEY DID IT IN DIFFERENT\nWAYS. DOES ANY OF THAT MATTER?\n>> HONESTLY, I DON'T REALLY THINK SO.\nIF YOU ASK SOMEONE WHO IS A FERVENT TRUMP SUPPORTER HOW THEY\nFEEL ABOUT THE LETTER, THEY WOULD DISAGREE WITH YOUR\nASSESSMENT. A LOT OF OPRAISES IN THERE.\n>> THAT ENDS THE ANALYSIS OF THE LETTER.\nDOCTORS DON'T WRITE HYPERBOLIC LETTERS THAT ARE FILLED WITH\nCRAZY ASSESSMENTS OF WHAT SOMEBODY'S SUPREME HEALTH IS.\n>> SURE. >> DOESN'T MATTER HOW YOU FEEL\nABOUT IT. THAT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT DR.\nSANJAY GUPTA DOES IN A REAL LETTER ABOUT ANYTHING.\nAM I WRONG ABOUT THIS? >> LACKED IN OBJECTIVE DATA, AS\nWELL. IT DIDN'T HAVE SOME SIMPLE\nOBJECTIVE DATA THAT YOU WOULD LOOK AT FOR SOMEONE'S RISK OF\nHEART DISEASE AND DIFFERENT THINGS.\n>> DR. TRUMP'S HEALTH AND IT WAS NOT A REAL DISCLOSURE OF HIS\nMEDICAL RECORDS. HE HAD IN HIS POCKET ONE-PAGE\nLETTER THAT HE REVEALED ON DR. OZ AND DR. OZ GOT TO TAKE A LOOK\nAT. SO, DOES THAT POLITICALLY ANSWER\nANY LINGERING QUESTIONS? >> NO.\nLOOK, PHILIP IS RIGHT. WHAT A MADE FOR TV MOMENT WHEN\nHE SITS DOWN AND TELLS DR. OZ, WE'RE NOT GOING TO DISCUSS\nSPECIFICS OR SPECIFICS ABOUT IT AND SITS DOWN AND PULLS OUT THE\nPIECE -- LOOK WHAT I HAVE IN MY HAND HERE.\n>> IT'S GOOD TV. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT POLITICS.\nTHE POLITICS OF IT, THOUGH, HE IS TRYING TO REACH A\nCONSTITUENCY THAT HE'S NOT DOING GREAT WITH NOW.\nTHAT IS WOMEN. HE'S DOING WELL WITH MARRIED\nWOMEN, BUT NOT DOING WELL WITH SINGLE WOMEN.\nSO, WHEN HE GOES ON DR. OZ, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A\nCONSTITUENCY OF VIEWERSHIP THAT IS LARGELY COMPRISED OF WOMEN.\nTHAT'S WHY HE DID THAT. AND, GUESS WHAT, WE'RE GOING TO\nBE TALKING ABOUT IT ALL DAY TODAY, AS WELL.\nTO HIS POINT, HE THINKS THAT HE IS NOT ONLY HITTING THAT\nCONSTITUENCY, BUT HITTING THE MAIN STREAM MEDIA.\nIT IS WORTH NOTING, THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME THAT WE'VE HAD A\nPOLITICIAN GO ON A PROGRAM THAT IS NOT MAIN STREAM MEDIA\nNECESSARILY, RIGHT? WE'VE SEEN THE OBAMAS DO IT ALL\nTHROUGH -- >> CLINTON JUST WENT ON KIMMEL\nYOU KNOW IN THIS FIRST BRUSH ABOUT HEALTH AND SHE WAS JOKING\nABOUT IT. >> THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT\nVENUES, BUT CLEARLY A STUNT. >> HERE IS A MOMENT FROM DR. OZ\nAND DONALD TRUMP'S EXCHANGE. WATCH THIS.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT STAMINA. YOU USE THAT WORD A LOT.\nYOU MADE IT AN ISSUE IN THIS CAMPAIGN.\nYOU ARGUE THAT A PRESIDENT HAS TO HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF\nSTAMINA. IF ELECTED AT AGE 70 YOU WILL BE\nTHE OLDEST PERSON TO EVER ENTER THE OVAL OFFICE.\nWHY DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE THE STAMINA FOR THE JOB?\n>> JUST ABOUT THE SAME AGE AS RONALD REAGAN AND HILLARY IS A\nYEAR BEHIND ME. JUST BASED ON MY LIFE, I\nACTUALLY, I DON'T KNOW IF THIS MAKES SENSE, I FEEL AS GOOD\nTODAY AS I DID WHEN I WAS 30. >> SANJAY, WHAT ELSE WAS\nREVEALED ON THE SHOW ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S HEALTH?\n>> FIRST, I WISH I FELT AS GOOD AS I DID WHEN I WAS 30.\nWE'RE GOING TO, OBVIOUSLY, SEE THE FULL SHOW WHEN HE HAS THE\nRESULTS RELEASED LATER TODAY. I TALKED TO DR. OZ YESTERDAY AND\nASKED ABOUT THIS. ONE THING HE ZEROED IN ON WAS\nHEART. DR. OZ IS A HEART SURGEON.\nHE HAD A CT OF HIS HEART LOOKING FOR CALCIUM.\nTHAT LOOKED GOOD. ALSO AN ECOCARDIOGRAM OF HIS\nHEART AND VARIOUS LAB TESTS. HOW DR. OZ SORT OF SUMMARIZED IT\nFOR ME IS HE SAID THOSE TESTS ALL LOOK GOOD FOR A MAN OF HIS\nAGE. >> HIS WEIGHT WAS A QUESTION.\n>> HIS WEIGHT IS A QUESTION BECAUSE WE'RE NOT EXACTLY SURE\nWHAT HIS WEIGHT IS I HEARD 236 AND I HEARD 267 AND AUDIENCE\nMEMBERS HEARD THAT AND HE IS 6'3\" IN HEIGHT.\n>> THAT WOULD BE OVERWEIGHT. IF IT WERE 267 AND HE'S 6'2\" OR\n6'3\", HE WOULD BE OOBESE. >> BMI OF ANYTHING OVER 30 IS\nCONSIDERED OBESE. IF HE WAS 236 HE WOULD BE\nOVERWEIGHT. >> NOW, WE ALL RESPECT THE\nMEDICAL PROFESSION VERY MUCH, BUT THESE NUMBERS THAT WE'RE\nGETTING FROM THEM, WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE THAT THESE ARE THE\nNUMBERS, RIGHT? BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GETTING ANY\nRAW MATERIAL. HOW MUCH SKEPTICISM DO YOU FEEL\nCOMFORTABLE PUTTING INTO THIS? THIS ISN'T AN ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTHAT HAS FORENSICALLY GONE OVER DATA.\nDOCTORS WHO SANJAY HAS SAID IN THE PAST, A CULIE COLIEGEALITY .\nHOW MUCH BACKUP SHOULD WE ASK FOR WHEN WE HAVE NOT GOTTEN\nBACKUP BEFORE EXCEPT FOR McCAIN? >> I THINK THE QUESTION HERE IS\nA FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION OF BOTH TRUST OF THE CANDIDATE TO, YOU\nKNOW, A SECONDARY DEGREE TRUST TO THE PEOPLE THEY'RE HIRING TO\nPROVIDE THE INFORMATION. THAT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL\nQUESTION. IF YOU THINK DONALD TRUMP IS\nSOMEONE WHO SAYS HE WEIGHS 236 POUNDS INSTEAD OF 267.\nHE COULD STAND ON A SCALE -- >> THAT IS A DIFFERENT SHOW.\nTHAT IS \"THE BIGGEST LOSER\" SHOW.\n>> HE WOULD NEVER BE ON THAT SHOW.\nJUST THE TITLE ALONE. >> SO MANY QUESTIONS IN THIS\nCAMPAIGN WHERE WE HAVE TO TAKE THE CANDIDATES ON TRUST.\nMORE OF AN ISSUE THIS YEAR THAN WE HAVE SEEN IN PAST CAMPAIGNS\nBECAUSE SO MUCH OF THIS CAMPAIGN HAS QUESTIONED THE EXTENT TO\nWHICH WE CAN TRUST CANDIDATES IN GENERAL, MUCH LESS THESE TWO\nCANDIDATES. >> HE'S PLAYING TO AN ADVANTAGE\nHERE ANY WAY YOU LOOK AT IT. HILLARY CLINTON HAD THE EPISODE\nWHERE SHE FAINTED AND FELL ON TO THAT VAN.\nSHE HAD THE 2012 EPISODE AND NOT HIM.\nNEVER A CHECK ON HIS HEALTH. HE EATS McDONALD'S AND RUNS\nAROUND LIKE A MACHINE. >> THEY BOTH RUN AROUND LIKE A\nMACHINE IN TERMS OF THEIR STAMINA.\nI'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH VOTERS WANT TO HEAR ABOUT COLONOSCOPY\nRESULTS. >> ALL DAY.\n>> I LOOK AT THOSE IN MY FREE TIME.\nFORGET ABOUT WORK TIME. >>> DONALD TRUMP IS NOW ON TOP\nIN SEVERAL BATTLEGROUND STATE",

LET'S START OFF WITH THE FACT\nYOU JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH DR. OZ.\nHE TOLD YOU WHAT HE WAS SHOWN BY DONALD TRUMP.\n>> DR. OZ IS A CARDIO THORACIC SURGEON.\nWE DRILL DOWN ON THE HEART STUFF SPECIFICALLY.\nTHAT'S THE BIGGEST CONCERN FOR MOST PEOPLE IS HEART HEALTH.\nHE HAD A CORONARY CALCIUM SCAN. HE HAD EKGs AND AN ECHO\nCARDIOGRAM, DONALD TRUMP.

OZ SEEMED TO HAVE ABOUT TRUMP'S HEART.\n>> THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION THAT DR. OZ TOLD YOU WAS\nPROVIDED, COMPARE TO THE AMOUNT THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAD.\n>> GOOD POINT. NEITHER ARE ENOUGH PROBABLY BUT\nWITH SECRETARY CLINTON'S REPORT, YOU DID GET A MORE DETAILED\nACCOUNTING, NOT ONLY OF SOME SPECIFIC HEALTH RETURNS BUT THE\nCT SCAN OF THE HEART, BRAIN, LUNGS THE MEDICATION SHE'S BEEN\nON AND SHE IS ON A BLOOD THINNER LOOKING AT HOW THEY ARE\nESTABLISHING WHAT BLOOD THINNER SHE SHOULD BE ON AND WHAT THE\nTEST RESULTS ARE HAVE BEEN. YOU DID GET A COMPLETE PICTURE.\nWE WILL SEE IF THERE IS MORE ON THE SHOW TOMORROW.\nRIGHT NOW THERE IS MORE INFORMATION ABOUT SECRETARY\nCLINTON THAN MR.

AND THE 2012 CONCUSSION SHE\nSUFFERED AFTER FAINTING THAT LED TO THE BLOOD CLOT BETWEEN HER\nSKULL AND BRAIN. >> DR. SANJAY GUPTA JOINS US\nNOW. AN EVALUATION OF WHAT YOU\nLEARNED. >> WE GOT A MUCH BETTER\nEXPLANATION AS BRIANNA SAID ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED OVER THE\nPAST FEW DAYS. THIS PNEUMONIA THAT WAS\nDIAGNOSED BY A CAT SCAN AS WELL. THIS YEAR IT IS INTERESTING\nSHE'S HAD A SCAN OF HER BRAIN, HER LUNGS AND OF HER HEART AS\nWELL. SHE HAS A HISTORY OF HEART\nDISEASE IN HER FAMILY. AND ALL THOSE LOOKED GOOD.\nKNOWING THAT HER BRAIN SCAN NOW LOOKS GOOD WAS AN IMPORTANT\nPOINT AFTER THE CONCUSSION. THIS IS NOT A FULL RELEASE OF\nMEDICAL RECORDS BY BIANY MEANS BUT AS BRIANNA SAID THIS IS MORE\nTHAN WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST AND CERTAINLY MORE THAN WE'VE SEEN\nFROM MR. TRUMP. >> AND ON THAT NOTE, TONIGHT WE\nARE LEARNING SOME NEW INFORMATION ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S\nHEALTH. BECAUSE HE GAVE THE RESULTS OF\nHIS RECENT PHYSICAL TO TV'S DR. OZ DURING A TAPED INTERVIEW.\nDR. OZ TELLING NBC NEWS HE WAS ACTUALLY CAUGHT OFF GUARD BY\nWHAT TRUMP REVEALED. HE DIDN'T EXPECT DONALD TRUMP TO\nHAND HIM THAT SHEET OF PAPER WITH THE DETAILS.\nHERE IS HOW HE PUT IT. >> I WAS, YOU KNOW, SURPRISED.\nI LOOKED AT THEM AND TRY TO PROCESS IT PRETTY QUICKLY.\nAND IF I WAS A DOCTOR, IF HE WAS MY PATIENT ARE THEY ARE GOOD FOR\nA MAN OF HIS AGE. >> WHAT DID IT SAID.\n>> DETAILS FROM A COLONOSCOPY HE HAD A FEW YEARS AGO.\nA CALCIUM SCAN OF HIS HEART THAT WAS DONE THAT LOOKED GOOD.\nHE HAD RESULTS FROM CHEST X-RAIES AND EKGS AND THE LABOTT\nRESULTS FROM LAST WEEK. >> TYPICALLY NOT THE WAY WE SEE\nCANDIDATES RELEASE THAT KIND OF INFORMATION AND THE DRAMA REALLY\nHEIGHTENED THIS MORNING BECAUSE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN SAYING NO\nTRUMP IS NOT GOING TO RELEASE THE RESULTS OF HIS PHYSICAL\nTODAY ON THE DR. OZ SHOW AND HEENEDED UP DOING JUST THAT,\nPULLING IT OUT OF HIS POCKET AND GIVING IT TO DR. OZ.\nTHIS IS JUST A ONE-PAGE SUMMARY OF THE PHYSICAL THAT HE HAD LAST\nWEEK. AND IT HAS NOT YET BEEN PUBLICLY\nRELEASED. THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN SAYS THEY\nWILL GET TO THAT TOMORROW. THEY LIKELY WILL RELEASE THAT\nTOMORROW. BUT CNN WAS OUTSIDE OF THE SHOW.\nWE TALKED TO MANY AUDIENCE MEMBERS WHO WERE INSIDE FOR THE\nTAPING AND -- SMALL PICTURE OF WHAT DONALD TRUMP'S HEALTH\nREALLY LOOKS LIKE. -- AUDIENCE MEMBER WHO SAYS SHE\nWEIGHS 236 POUNDS. HE SAYS HE DOES NOT EXERCISE AND\nTHAT HE WOULD LIKE TO LOSE BETWEEN 15 AND 20 POUNDS AND HE\nIS ON STATINS, DRUGS THAT HELP LOWER CHOLESTEROL LEVELS.\nTOMORROW WHEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS ANTICIPATED TO RELEASE THIS\nMEDICAL SUMMARY FROM HIS POSITION, IT SHOULD BE NOTED\nTHAT THIS STILL IS NOT ONE THE RESULT OF WHAT THAT PHYSICAL WAS\nLIKE BUT TWO NOT A FULL DISCLOSURE OF HIS MEDICAL\nHISTORY AND DOCUMENTS THAT WOULD BE MORE IN LINE WITH PREVIOUS\nPRESIDENTIAL NOMINEES. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nAND OUT FRONT NOW, PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FORMER DOCTOR.\nAND -- MAGGIE, JUST IN TERMS OF STYLE\nTODAY. YOU GET THE LETTER AND THE LIST\nOF THINGS FROM HILLARY CLINTON TODAY.\nDONALD TRUMP GOING OUT ON DR. OZ, AND I'VE GOT IT.\nHERE IT IS. AND NOW EVEN NOW WE'RE NOT\nGETTING THE FORMAL RESULTS PUBLICLY TILL TOMORROW.\n>> WHAT HAVE WE GOT? WE KNOW WHAT HE WEIGHS.\nTHAT IS THE NEW THING WE LEARNED.\nWE KNEW HE WAS ON STATIN BEFORE, A FORM OF, FROM THE VERY UNUSUAL\nLETTER HIS DOCTOR WROTE A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO.\nWE ALSO KNOW FROM THAT NOTE THAT THE DOCTOR SAID IN THAT LETTER\nTHAT TRUMP HAD LOST 15 POUNDS OVER THE PREVIOUS YEAR.\nI DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS TRUMP WEIGHED BEFORE.\nI DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS NOW.\nHE DID THIS WITH HIS USUAL STYLE.\nHE WASN'T GOING TO RELIES T. HE IS GOING TO RELIES IT.\nTHAT OBSCURES THE FACT THIS IS STILL A PRETTY LOW LEVEL OF\nDISCLOSURE FOR A PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE.\nAND I DON'T KNOW HOICH MORE WE'RE GOING SEE WHEN THEY MAKE\nTHE RELEASE LATER THIS WEEK. >> AND SANJAY, IN TERMS OF WHAT\nWE'RE GOING TO GET, ONE COULD PRESUME THE THINGS THAT WERE\nDISCUSSED IN THIS INTERVIEW WITH DR. OZ, CHOLESTEROL, STATINS,\nBLOOD PRESSURE, BUT WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE WHAT ELSE.\n>> AND I TALKED TO DR. OZ A LITTLE TODAY AS WELL.\nAND YOU HEARD HIM TALK ABOUT. HE'S A CARDIO THORACIC SURGEON\nSO CERTAINLY SOMETHING HE WAS LOOKING FOR WAS A HEART.\nAND EKGS AND THE CONNECTICUT -- CT SCAN OF THE HEART.\nTHOSE COULD BE IMPORTANT TESTS TO RELAY ANY CONCERNS ABOUT\nHEART DISEASE. >> WHEN HE ADMITS HE DOESN'T\nEXERCISE AND HE'S OVERWEIGHT. >> AND A STATIN DRUG.\nAND THAT IS WHAT YOU WOULD REALLY WANT TO ZERO O IN ON.\n>> AND DOCTOR, FIRST OF ALL, YOU ARE SUPPORTING HILLARY CLINTON.\nBUT YOU HAVE TOLD ME ON THE SHOW THAT YOU WANTED A FULL\nNEUROLOGICAL EXAM. YOU WANTED THOSE RESULTS.\nOBVIOUSLY WE'RE NOT GETTING A FULL MEDICAL HISTORY HERE IN\nEITHER CASE. WE CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE THAT ON\nTHE NEURALLOGICAL SIDE. ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH WHAT YOU\nNOW HAVE. >> I WAS VERY IMPRESSED SHE GOT\nA CT SCAN. BY THAT ALONE I'M VERY IMPRESSED\nWITH HER DOCTOR. BUT I THINK BOTH KLDS SHOULD\nHAVE WHAT WE CALL NEUROPSYCHOLOGIC TESTING.\n-- BOTH CANDIDATES. I THINK SHE NEEDS\nNEUROPSYCHOLOGIC TESTING JUST TO SEE THERE'S NO NEUROLOGIC\nSEQUELAE FROM HER INJURY. AND TRUMP I THINK NEEDS A\nNEUROPSYCHOLOGIC BECAUSE OF HIS ERRATIC BEHAVIOR.\nIF SOMEBODY CAME INTO MY OFFICE WITH THAT KIND OF -- THE KIND OF\nTHINGS THAT HE DOES, I WOULD REALLY BE WONDERING ABOUT THE\nPERSONALITY. I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S -- WE KNOW\nHE'S GOT A NARCISSISTIC PERSONALITY DISORDER AT THE VERY\nLEAST. BUT I SOMETIMES WONDER IF HE\nWOULD EVEN BE HYPOMANIC. BUT I THINK PSYCHOLOGIC TESTING\nWOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR HIM. IS SOMETHING I THINK MAYBE\nSHOULD BE FOR ALL CANDIDATES. >> WHEN YOU SAY ALL CANDIDATES\nAND OBVIOUSLY THERE IS SOME SPECULATION IF WHAT THE DOCTOR\nWAS SAYING THERE. GOING THIS IS GOING TO BE THE\nFINAL POINT OF THIS. WE'RE NOT GOING GET A DEEP\nMEDICAL HISTORY FROM EITHER ONE. >> OF COURSE NOT.\nTHERE IS NO LAW THAT REQUIRES ANY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE NEEDS\nTO PUT ANY RECORDS OUT QUITE FRANKLY.\nAS FAR AS ANY KIND OF MENTAL TESTING.\nLAST TIME I THINK WE EVEN SAW THAT WAS BACK IN McGOVERN IN\n'72. AND [INDISCERNIBLE]\n. WHAT WE SAW TODAY WAS A MADE FOR\nTV MOMENT THAT DONALD TRUMP CREATED AND HE DID IT ON A SHOW\nTO TRY TO REACH A CERTAIN VOTER, WHICH WAS WOMEN.\nAND AS MAGGIE SAID, IT WAS A GAME FOR DONALD TRUMP.\n>> BUT THAT IS THE AUDIENCE HE NEEDS TO REACH.\nAND THAT IS THE AUDIENCE OF THAT SHOW.\n>> IT IS THE AUDIENCE HE NEEDS TO REACH IT'S INTERESTING\nBECAUSE WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS A SUMMARY THAT SOMEONE ELSE HAS\nPUT TOGETHER, USUALLY WITH INPUT FROM THE CAMPAIGN OF THE MEDICAL\nRECORDS BY SOMEONE WHO MAY ALSO BE A FRIEND OR AT LEAST HAVE A\nCOLLEGIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CANDIDATE.\nYOU HAVE TO TAKE ALL THAT INTO ACCOUNT.\nPART OF THE REASON YOU ASK FOR THE MEDICAL RECORDS.\nSO YOU CAN GET DISPASSIONATE REVIEW.\nBUT THE POINT IS WE DON'T KNOW EVEN WHAT WE DON'T KNOW.\nNOT TO SUGGEST THERE IS SOMETHING THERE.\nWE DON'T KNOW. THAT IS SORT OF THE POINT.\nI DON'T KNOW THAT WE SHOULD BE MAKING DIAGNOSES, EVEN\nPSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSES FROM ITHE. IT WAS INTERESTING AT THE END OF\nSECRETARY CLINTON'S NOTE THE DOCTOR WROTE \"I BELIEVE HER\nMENTAL HEALTH IS GOOD\". >> SHE'S NOT A PSYCHIATRIST.\n>> RIGHT. >> IN BOTH CASES THEY ARE\nGETTING LETTERS FROM DOCTORS WHO HAVE KNOWN THEM AND WORKED WITH\nTHEM FOR MANY, MANY YEARS. OUT FRONT FOCUS IN.\nBREAKING NEWS. TRUMP AHEAD NEW POLLS AHEAD.",

THEIR PROBLEM IS THAT THEY ACTED\nLIKE CLINTONS WHEN SHE HAD THIS ISSUE ON SUNDAY.\nTHEY WHISKED HER AWAY, EVADE IT HAD PRESS.\n>> PEOPLE SCREAMING COVER UP. >> AND THEY TREAT IT LIKE YOU'RE\nHIDING SOMETHING AND WHEN YOU TREAT IT LIKE THAT AND YOU HAVE\nA HISTORY OF HIDING THINGS IN THE PAST AND SHE HAS ISSUES THAT\nSHE USED AS EXCUSES FOR WHY THINGS IN THE E-MAIL CONTROVERSY\nHAPPENED, YES PEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONS, IT'S A RATIONAL THING\nTO HAVE QUESTIONS AND I'M NOT SURE YOU OVERCOME THAT IMPULSE\nTHE CLINTONS HAVE, WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE HIDING ANYTHING,\nUNLESS YOU ARE FULLY TRANSPARENT ABOUT THIS AND THEY'RE NOT SO\nGOOD ABOUT THAT. >> MARY KATHERINE, DREW, SANJAY,\nTHANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH ON THE HEALTH PIECE OF ALL OF THIS.\n>>> COMING UP NEXT HERE, COLIN",

THEN A COUPLE HOURS BEFORE MR.\nTRUMP WAS SET TO APPEAR THE CAMPAIGN SAID ACTUALLY THERE\nWOULD BE NO DISCLOSURE OF THE PHYSICAL HE UNDERWENT, THEN\nSUDDENLY REVERSAL, TRUMP PRESENTING -- THE CAMPAIGN\nSAYING A ONE PAGE SUMMARY OF HIS RESULTING TO DR. OZ.\nSO WHAT DID THE PAPERWORK SHOW? LET'S BEGIN WITH NATIONAL\nPOLITICAL REPORTER MJ LEE IN NEW YORK.\nYOU TALKED TO FOLKS IN THE AUDIENCE.\nWHAT DID TRUMP TELL THEM TODAY? >> BROOKE, REMEMBER, THIS IS THE\nCANDIDATE WHOSE DOCTOR CLAIMS WOULD BE THE HEALTHIEST PERSON\nEVER ELECTED PRESIDENT. IT SOUNDS LIKE DR. OZ'S TAKE\nAWAY TODAY WAS, INDEED, THAT TRUMP IS IN VERY GOOD HEALTH.\nLET'S LISTEN TO THINGS AUDIENCE MEMBERS TOLD US AFTER THE\nTAPING. >> MOST OF THE TIME HE DIDN'T\nREALLY ANSWER THE QUESTIONS DIRECTLY SO IT WAS PROBABLY\nFLATTERING FOR HIM AL OWE I DON'T THINK IF YORE PAYING\nATTENTION HE ANSWERED ANYTHING. >> DID HE SHARE DETAILS FROM THE\nPHYSICAL? >> YEAH, DR. OZ READ THAT OUT\nLOUD. >> WHAT INFORMATION WAS IN THE\nLETTER. >> THAT SHE WAS IN GREAT SHAPE.\n>> ACCORDING TO DR. OZ EVERYTHING SEEMED NORMAL.\n>> THAT'S A QUOTE HE USED? >> YEAH, NO SURPRISES EXCEPT,\nAGAIN, THAT DONALD TRUMP SAYS HE'S ON A STAT STIN,\nCHOLESTEROL-LOWERING DRUG AND THAT'S BASICALLY IT.\n>> THE STATIN, OF COURSE, IS A DRUG YOU TAKE TO MANAGE YOUR\nCHOLESTEROL LEVEL, TRUMP SEEMED TO SAY HIS CHOLESTEROL LEVEL\nUSED TO BE HIGH BUT CONFIRMED THAT AS OF RIGHT NOW IT'S ON A\nVERY GOOD LEVEL. ON OTHER INTERESTING INFORMATION\nTHAT WE GOT FROM THE AUDIENCE MEMBERS, AND I WANT TO STRESS\nAGAIN THAT THIS IS AUDIENCE MEMBERS COMING OUT OF THE TAPING\nPARAPHRASING WHAT THEY THOUGHT THEY HEARD, TRUMP WOULD LIKE TO\nLOSE SOME WEIGHT, AT LEAST 15 POUNDS.\nMULTIPLE AUDIENCE MEMBERS TOLD US TRUMP DOES NOT EXERCISE BUT\nHE WANTS TO PLAY MORE GOLF AND ONE AUDIENCE MEMBER SAID HE SAID\nHE'S GOOD ENOUGH AT GOLF TO PLAY IN THE PGA.\nONE TOPIC, BROOKE, THAT DIDN'T COME IS UP HILLARY CLINTON.\nMULTIPLE AUDIENCE MEMBERS TELLING US TRUMP SIMPLY WISHED\nHER WELL BUT DIDN'T DEVIL INTO POLITICS, OF COURSE, HILLARY\nCLINTON HAS BEEN RESTING AT HOME IN CHAPPAQUA, NEW YORK, TAKING A\nCOUPLE DAYS OFF THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL EVER SINCE IT WAS REVEALED\nOVER THE WEEKEND SHE HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA.\nBOTH CANDIDATES FEELING A LOT OF PRESSURE TO SHARE MORE\nINFORMATION ABOUT THEIR MEDICAL HISTORIES AND RECORDS.\nBROOKE? >> IT'S ABOUT TRANSPARENCY, THEY\nWANT TO BE THE LEADERS OF THE FREE WORLD.\nMJ LEE, THANK YOU SO MUCH. MJ TALKED TO MEMBERS OF THE\nAUDIENCE, WE DID AS WELL. I TALKED TO KELLY PLAT LAST\nHOUR, A PHARMACY INTERN SITTING IN THE AUDIENCE IN THE STUDIO,\nSHE TOLD ME SHE LEARNED TRUMP TRIES TO EAT HEALTHY FOODS.\nHERE'S KELLY. >> HE IS THE EPITOME OF HEALTH,\nI BELIEVE HIM ON, THAT YOU CAN SEE IT.\nHE LOOKS IT. YOU CAN SEE HE'S A VERY HEALTHY\nMAN AND DR. OZ AGREED OF DR. OZ READ THE LETTERS FROM HIS\nPHYSICIAN. HE DOES NOT EXERCISE BUT GOING\nTO THESE FUNCTIONS WHERE HE'S METING WITH 35,000 PEOPLE,\n45,000 PEOPLE AND YOU'RE SITTING THERE WALKING EVERYWHERE, THAT'S\nEXERCISE. TO ME THAT IS EXERCISE.\n>> LET ME BRING IN OUR CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT DR. SANJAY\nGUPTA, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR MARY CATHERINE HAIM AND\nINVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT DREW GRIFFIN.\nSO THE GOOD DOCTOR, LET'S BEGIN WITH YOU.\nBEFORE WE GET INTO YOUR ASSESSMENT AND WE'LL BE CRYSTAL\nCLEAR THAT YOU HAVE NEVER EXAMINED DONALD TRUMP IN YOUR\nLIFE, YOU TALKED TO DR. OZ THIS MORNING, WHAT DID HE SHARE?\n>> HE TOLD ME THAT -- IT WAS INTERESTING, HE SAID THEY\nWEREN'T SURE WHEN THE SHOW STARTED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO\nGET ANY OF TRUMP'S MEDICAL RECORDS.\n>> AS EARLY AS THIS MORNING. >> SO HE DID WHAT'S CALLED A\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS WHICH BASICALLY MEANS I ASK YOU\nQUESTIONS, HAVE YOU HAD PROBLEMS WITH X, Y, Z, GETTING A MEDICAL\nHISTORY. HE PUSHED TRUMP FOR MORE\nTRANSPARENCY AND AT THAT POINT IS WHEN THIS ONE-PAGE LETTER WAS\nREVEALED, THE PAGE LETTER THAT YOU JUST HEARD DESCRIBED BY\nTHOSE GUESTS, GAVE NUMBERS ABOUT CHOLESTEROL AND BLOOD PRESSURE\nAND THINGS LIKE THAT. THAT'S THE WAY IT WENT DOWN.\nSO IT WASN'T AN EXAMPLE OF ANY SORT THERE AND IT SOUNDS LIKE IT\nWAS CURSORY IN TERMS OF WHAT WAS PROVIDED BY BUT EVEN UP UNTIL IT\nSOUNDS LIKE THIS MORNING WHEN THIS WAS ALL BEING PLANNED THEY\nWEREN'T SURE WHAT IF ANY MEDICAL RECORDS WOULD BE RELEASED.\n>> BUT THIS ONE PAGE, THIS WAS BASED UPON THE PHYSICAL FROM\nLAST WEEK, CORRECT? >> THAT'S RIGHT.\n>> SO BASED UPON WHAT WE'VE SEEN AND ALSO JUST HEARING HE SAYS HE\nWANTS TO LOSE 15 TO 20 POUNDS, HE USED TO HAVE HIGH\nCHOLESTEROL, TOOK MEDS TO HELP WITH THAT, YOUR OVERALL\nASSESSMENT? >> YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND OF HARD\nTO MAKE AN OVERALL ASSESSMENT. THERE'S NOTHING THAT'S A RED\nFLAG BUT THIS IS ALL SO STRANGE. YOU'RE JUST --\n>> IT'S OKAY, WE TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THAT OUT LOUD.\nIT'S STRANGE. >> TO SOMEHOW MAKE THIS MORE\nTHAN WHAT IT IS IS HARD TO DO. YOU'RE SEEING EXACTLY WHAT\nSOMEONE WANTS YOU TO SEE IN A FORGNAT IS HIGHLY UNUSUAL AND,\nYOU KNOW, THERE'S NO PATIENT/PHYSICIAN RELATIONSHIP\nHERE WHATSOEVER SO I JUST DON'T THINK YOU CAN MAKE ANYTHING OF\nIT GOOD OR BAD.

THEN INTERESTINGLY THIS MORNING\nTHAT WAS OFF. TRUMP TELLING REPORTERS THEY HAD\nBASICALLY CHANGED THEIR MIND, THEY WOULD NOT BE HANDING OVER\nTHEIR MEDICAL RECORDS OVER ON YOUR TV SHOW.\n>> JOHN ROBERTS JUST REPORTED A LITTLE WHILE AGO THAT HE'S GOING\nTO GO ON DR.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE.\nNO REPORTERS WERE AT IT THE TAPING, NOTHING HAS BEEN\nRELEASED PUBLICLY, WE'RE TOLD THAT WHAT HE HANDED OVER ON TV\nWAS A ONE PAGES MEDICAL SUMMARY FROM OUR OLD FRIEND DR.\nBORNSTEIN. I'M NOT SURE IF THERE ARE JOKES\nIN THIS ONE TOO. WE CAN REPORT THAT THE HOST OF\nTHE TV SHOW, DR.

A REAL SHOWMAN CAN -- THERE'S\nBEEN NO RELEASE OF INFORMATION ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S HEALTH.\nNOBODY OTHER THAN THAT GUY ON TV HAS SEEN ANYTHING NEW ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP'S HEALTH TODAY, EVEN THOUGH A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE\nCONVINCED THEMSELVES THAT HE'S MADE SOME NEW DISCLOSURE ABOUT\nHIS HEALTH.

TRUMP DISCLOSING THE RESULTS OF\nHIS LATEST MEDICAL EXAM WITH A DOCTOR HE'S HAD FOR MANY YEARS\nTO DR. OZ. THE EPISODE, TAPE TODAY, AIRING\nTOMORROW. WE GOT A SNEAK PREVIEW FROM SOME\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS LEAVING THE STUDIO.\nLISTEN. >> WE ARE TRUMP SUPPORTERS.\nJUST PUT THAT RIGHT OUT THERE. >> WAS IT A LETTER?\n>> IT WAS A LETTER, BUT ALSO HAD SOME RESULTS FROM TESTING THAT\nHE HAD AND DR. OZ WENT OVER THE RESULTS.\n>> AND WHAT WERE IN THOSE RESULTS?\n>> BASICALLY THAT HE'S HEALTHY MAN.\nI THINK WE HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT HE WILL BE A HEALTHY PRESIDENT.\n>> YEAH, THERE WAS NO SURPRISES, EXCEPT, AGAIN, DONALD TRUMP SAID\nHE'S ON A CHOLESTEROL LOWER DRUG.\n>> HE'D LIKE TO LOSE 15 OR 20 POUNDS.\n>> CHRIS WALLACE AN OR ITS \"FOX NEWS SUNDAY.\"\nWHAT IS THE STATE OF CAMPAIGN WHEN ONE CANDIDATE IS AT HOME\nRESTING AFTER SHE SAYS SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA AND THE\nOTHER IS RELEASING HIS MEDICAL RECORDS TO DR. OZ.\nIT'S AN AMAZING MOMENT 55 DAYS OUT FROM THE ELECTION DAY.\n>> WELL, I WAS JUST THINKING,  ADDITION TO ALL THE OTHER HEALTH\nISSUES, THE TWO CANDIDATES HAVE HAD A PERSONALITY TRANSPLANT\nBECAUSE HERE YOU HAVE HILLARY CLINTON SENDING OUT 20 TWEETS,\nSHE AND HER CAMPAIGN, 20 TWEETS IN ONE HOUR, SOUNDS LIKE TRUMP,\nAND TRUMP IS DISCLOSING MEDICAL RECORDS ON DR. OZ BEING\nTRANSPARENT THE DAY AFTER HE ANNOUNCED A BIG NEW PROPOSAL FOR\nA BIG GOVERNMENT SPENDING PROGRAM ON PAY MATERNITY LEAVE.\n>> IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. AND YOU WONDER WHAT KIND OF\nPRESSURE THIS IS GOING TO PUT ON HILLARY CLINTON AND HER CAMP TO\nRELEASE MORE OF HER MEDICAL HISTORY BECAUSE ACCORDING TO DR.\nOZ, HE WENT THROUGH A FULL REVIEW OF TRUMP'S SYSTEMS, AND\nLAUNDRY LISTED NERVOUS SYSTEM, HEAD AND NECK, HORMONE LEVELS,\nCARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH. I MEAN OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF PEOPLE\nARE GOING TO TUNE IN INTO THAT AND SEE HOW THAT WENT.\nHIS DOCTOR SAYS HE IS HEALTHY AND FIT TO BE PRESIDENT, BUT\nHILLARY CLINTON, WE'RE STILL WAITING, THEY ARE PROMISING THAT\nWE WILL SEE MORE OF HER MEDICAL HISTORY LATER ON THIS WEEK.\n>> WELL, TO BE FAIR, SHE HAD BEEN A LOT MORE TRANSPARENT UP\nUNTIL NOW THAN DONALD TRUMP HAD AS YOU REMEMBER, HE HAD HIS\nGASTROSBROLGS SEND A TWO-PARAGRAPH NOTE WHILE THE\nLIMOUSINE WAITING OUTSIDE SAID THAT TRUMP WILL BE THE\nHEALTHIEST PRESIDENT IN HISTORY, BUT AT THIS POINT, THE HEALTH\nTRANSPARENCY GAP NOW WORKS IN TRUMP'S FAVOR BECAUSE OF THE DR.\nOZ INCIDENT. SO SHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO GO ON\nSOME REALITY TV SHOW AND RELEASE ALL OF HER -- SERIOUSLY\nSPEAKING, SHE IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE MORE FORTHCOMING\nPARTICULARLY AFTER THIS HEALTH SCARE OVER THE WEEKEND.\n>> ABOUT THE WEIGHT LOSS YOU HEARD, APPARENTLY DONALD TRUMP\nSAID TO DR. OZ HE WOULD LIKE TO LOSE 15 TO 20 POUNDS, DR. OZ\nAGREED IS WHAT DR. OZ'S SHOW HAS TOLD US.\nFORMER SECRETARY OF STATE COLON POWELL REVEALING, CHRIS, HOW HE\nREALLY FEELS ABOUT BOTH OF THESE CANDIDATES.\nHACKERS LEAKING COLON POWELL'S PRIVATE E-MAILS.\nPOUFL WAS CALLING TRUMP A NATIONAL DISGRACE AND AN\nINTERNATIONAL PARIAH. HE ALSO SLAMS CLINTON FOR TRYING\nTO MAKE HIM A SCAPEGOAT IN THE HER E-MAIL SCANNEDING SAYING I\nTOLD HER STAFF THREE TIMES. I HAD TO THROW A MINI TANTRUM TO\nGET THEIR ATTENTION. SHE KEEPS TRIPPING INTO THESE\nCHARACTER MINE FIELDS. WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THESE\nE-MAIL REVELATIONS, CHRIS? >> WELL, I HAVE TO SAY, I MAKE\nMORE OF WHAT POWELL IS SAYING ABOUT CLINTON.\nPOWELL HAS BECOME A REPUBLICAN IN NAME ONLY.\nIF YOU REMEMBER HE SUPPORTED BARACK OBAMA AGAINST McCAIN IN\n2008, OBAMA AGAINST ROMNEY IN 2012, SO NO SURPRISE THAT HE\nWOULD NOT -- THE LANGUAGE IS KIND OF TOUGH, BUT NO SURPRISE\nTHAT HE WOULDN'T HAVE MUCH USE FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nBUT YOU CAN TELL, HE IS GENUINELY UPSET BY THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGNS. AND IT HAS BEEN AN EFFORT ON\nTHEIR PART TO SAY WELL SHE WAS JUST FOLLOWING THE ADVICE OF\nCOLON POWELL WHEN SHE SAID UP THIS PRIVATE SYSTEM.\nTHE FACT IS, THEY WERE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS.\nPOWELL DIDN'T HAVE A PRIVATE SERVER IN HIS BASEMENT, HE WAS\nUSING AOL.COM BACK IN 2005, OR 2000 RATHER, BACK WHEN THE WHOLE\nE-MAIL SYSTEM AND THE INTERNET WAS ALL COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.\nSO, YOU KNOW, I THINK WITH SOME JUSTICE, HE IS UPSET AT THE\nIDEAS. HE IS TRYING TO DRAG HIM INTO\nTHIS AND MAKE IT SEEM LIKE HE WAS THE REASON THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON SET UP THE PRIVATE SERVER.\n>> THERE WAS ALSO AN E-MAIL EXCHANGE WITH A DEMOCRATIC E\nMEGA DONOR, JEFFREY LEADS WAS IN THERE DEPICTING HER AS A SORE\nLOSER WHEN SHE LOST TO BARACK OBAMA SAYING SHE HATES THAT THE\nPRESIDENT KICKED HER BUTT IN 2008.\nSHE USED A DIFFERENT WORD THERE, BUT HE WENT ON TO SAY NO ONE\nLIKES HER AND THE CRIMINAL THING AIN'T OVER.\nI DON'T THINK THE PRESIDENT WOULD WEEP IF SHE FOUND HERSELF\nIN REAL LEGAL TROUBLE. WAS THIS ALSO VERY REVEALING OF\nTHE JITTERS THAT THE PARTY, THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN GENERAL IS\nFEELING RIGHT NOW OVER HILLARY CLINTON AND RECENT POLLING?\n>> OH SURE. LOOK, THIS RACE IS TIGHTENING,\nAND IT'S TIGHTENING I THINK FOR TWO REASONS.\nONE, DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN A MORE DISCIPLINED, BETTER\nCANDIDATE OVER THE LAST THREE, FOUR WEEKS SINCE HIS NEW TEAM\nTOOK OVER, AND AGAIN, THIS GOES TO THE PERSONALITY TRANSPLANT.\nHE IS DELIVERING MORE SPEECHES ON TELEPROMPTER, MORE POLICY IN\nHIS SPEECHES. YOU KNOW, THERE'VE BEEN SOME\nBUMPS IN THE ROAD, FOR INSTANCE GOING DOWN TO MEXICO, HAVING\nTHAT MEETING WITH THE MEXICAN PRESIDENT, THEN COMING BACK AND\nSEEMING TO GO BACK ON THE IDEA HE WAS GOING TO SOFTEN HIS\nPOSITION ON IMMIGRATION AND IN FACT DELIVERING A HARD LINE\nPOSITION, BUT MEANWHILE, THE NEWS HAS BEEN ALMOST ALL BAD FOR\nHILLARY CLINTON FOR SEVERAL WEEKS NOW.\nMORE REVELATIONS ABOUT THE E-MAIL, THE FBI 15,000 E-MAILS\nTHEY WERE ABLE TO RECOVER, THE COZY CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION, THE STATE DEPARTMENT, NOW THE HEALTH\nSCARE. SO NOT SURPRISINGLY ALL OF THIS\nHAS LED TO HIS RISE IN THE POLLS AND HER DECLINE.\nSTILL, VERY MUCH SHE'S STILL THE FAVORITE, BUT IF HE IS AHEAD BY\nFIVE POINTS IN OHIO, THAT'S A VERY TELLING SIGN.\nTHAT IS A, YOU KNOW, THE SWINGINGEST OF SWING STATES AND\nONE THAT THE REPUBLICANS ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO HAVE.\n>> THERE IS SO MUCH GOING ON IN THIS HORSE RACE AND YOU HAVE\nINTERESTING GUESTS ON FOX NEWS SUNDAY.\nWHO DO YOU HAVE? >> TOP OFFICIALS OF BOTH THE\nTRUMP AND CLINTON COMPANIES, BUT ALSO WE'RE GOING TO TALK TO\nGEORGE CLOONEY AND JOHN PRENDERGST.\nFASCINATING INVESTIGATION THEY'VE UNDERTAKEN.\nTHE HUMAN RIGHTS IN AFRICA, THEY HAVE SET UP SOMETHING CALLED THE\nCENTURY WHICH IS UNCOVERED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THEFT AND\nCORRUPTION IN SOUTH SUDAN. THE NEWEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD\nWITH MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN THAT COUNTRY BEING CAUGHT IN THE\nCROSS FIRE. WE'LL BE TALKING GEORGE CLOONEY\nABOUT THAT AND ALSO TALK SOME POLITICS, ALL COMING UP ON FOX\nNEWS SUNDAY. >> VERY GOOD STUFF, CHRIS\nWALLACE, THANKS FOR JOINING THUS AFTERNOON, GOOD TO HAVE YOU.\n>> YOU BET.",

UPDATES WILL HAPPEN AT 8:30.\nI WILL BRING YOU THE LATEST\nAND I DO NOT EXPECT IMPROVEMENTS.\nCOOL, CLEAR CONDITIONS AND WE\nHAVE WINDS OFF WATER. TRACK A LITTLE CLOUD COVER\nOVER SOUTHEASTERN\nMASSACHUSETTS. EARLY THIS MORNING BUT BOSTON\nRIGHT NOW, YOU ARE AT 58.\nYOU ARE CRYSTAL CLEAR AND YOU ARE CHILLY.\nSO 57 DEGREES WILL DO IT AT 7\nA.M. BY 9 A.M. 62 DEGREES.\nMID-60s AT 11 A.M., AND\nTHROUGH THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON, YOU ARE PROBABLY\nNOT CRACKING 70 TODAY IN\nBOSTON. AND IT IS BECAUSE WINDS ARE\nCOMING IN OFF THE WATER.\nJUST WANT TO POINT OUT. IT IS A LITTLE GUSTY THIS\nMORNING.\nEVEN BOSTON COULD SEE GUSTS 15 TO 20 MILES PER HOUR.\nAND UP TO 25 MILES PER HOUR\nOVER THE CAPE AND THE ISLAND. NO RAIN IN THE FORECAST, JUST\nA LITTLE BIT OF MORNING CLOUD\nCOVER, AGAIN, OVER SOUTHEASTERN MASSACHUSETTS.\nMOSTLY SUNNY SUMS IT UP\nPERFECTLY AND WINDS WILL SLOWLY WEAKEN THROUGH THE\nAFTERNOON AND WITH WINDS\nCOMING OFF THE TWAWR PREVENTS THE COAST FROM WARMING UP AS\nMUCH AS INLAND TOWNS AND\nCITIES. SO QUINCY, BOSTON, MALDEN, 67\nDEGREES.\n69 IN CAMBRIDGE AND WARMER TEMPERATURES FROM DEDHAM AND\nNEWTON AND ARLINGTON.\nAND SOMERVILLE AT 72 DEGREES. MORE LOWER 70s IN LAWRENCE,\nMANCHESTER TO FITCHBURG.\nWORCESTER AT 58 DEGREES AND FOR THE CAPE AND ISLANDS, THEY\nWILL TEETER PROBABLY IN THE\nUPPER 60s FOR THE MOST PART. WE HAVE A LOT OF 40s ON THE\nMAP FOR TOMORROW MORNING.\nI WOULD SAY IT IS GOING TO BE ABOUT 5 DEGREES COOLER WHEN\nYOU WAKE UP TOMORROW VERSUS\nWHAT YOU HAVE THIS MORNING, SO DEFINITELY ANOTHER SWEATER OR\nJACKET MORNING.\nFROM THERE, IT IS SHORT SLEEVES.\nLOW TO MID-70s HERE.\nWITH SUNSHINE FOR YOUR FRIDAY. SO WE HAVE GOT FRIDAY SON.\nSATURDAY, CLOUDS STARTING TO\nLEAK IN WITH FUTURECAST AND BY THE TIME WE HIT SUNDAY, RISK\nOF MORNING SHOWERS NORTH AND\nWEST OF BOSTON. AFTERNOON SHOWERS.\nBETTER CHANCE TO GET LOCALLY\nHEAVIER RAIN AND ESPECIALLY SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY.\nAND WEEKEND HIGH TEMPERATURES\nWILL BE IN THE 70s MOST DAYS. I EXPECT THAT IT WILL BE A\nLITTLE BIT WARMER HERE ON\nSUNDAY. SO I WILL GIVE YOU SATURDAY,\n77.\nSUNDAY, 79 WITH SCATTERED RAIN THAT LASTS US INTO MONDAY\nMORNING AND THEN DRY, TUESDAY,\nWEDNESDAY. SEND YOU OVER TO CATHERINE\nPARROTTA.\nCATHERINE, YOU HAVE A NEW ACCIDENT ON THE ROADS RIGHT\nNOW.\n>> Catherine:  YEAH, ROADS ARE GETTING PRETTY BUSY.\nTHIS ACCIDENT ON 93 SOUTH.\nI WILL CHECK THAT FOR YOU ON THE NEXT UPDATE.\nPIKE EASTBOUND, THIS CRASH ON\nGRAFTON ROAD. AGAIN, PIKE GOING EASTBOUND\nRIGHT IN GRAFTON, YOU CAN SEE\nTHE DELAYS BEHIND IT BECAUSE THE RIGHT SHOULDER IS CLOSED\nIN THAT SPOT.\nBUILD IN EXTRA TIME IF THAT'S ON YOUR COMMUTE.\nOVER HERE, THE EXPRESSWAY,\nFORTUNATELY NOT AT PARK STREET.\nAN ACCIDENT AT DORCHESTER AVE.\nALSO PRETTY SLOW ON THE EXPRESSWAY NORTH THROUGH\nQUINCY THERE IN MILTON.\nAVERAGE BEING 21  MILES PER HOUR.\n27 MILES PER HOUR.\nI WANT TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS WELL.\nTHIS IS NATICK.\nYOU CAN SEE THIS ICON NOW ON THE MAP.\nA WATER MAIN BREAK IN THIS\nSPOT OF SPEEN STREET BETWEEN 135 AND POND STREET OVER HERE.\nSO IF YOU WERE HEADED IN THIS\nDIRECTION, BUILD IN EXTRA TIME FOR THAT.\nWE JUST GOT A CALL ABOUT THAT.\nWHO WILL BE WORKING ON THAT FOR WRITE SOME TIME NOW.\nTAKE A LOOK AT OUR CAMERA,\nTHIS IS TRAFFIC AS YOU ARE ON THE EXPRESSWAY.\nVOLUME STARTING TO BUILD AS IT\nDIPCALLY DOES.

THEY SAY IN TERMS OF HER\nPNEUMONIA DIAGNOSIS LAST FRIDAY, HILLARY CLINTON HAD A\nNON-CONTRAST CHEST CT SCAN THAT WAS PERFORMED LAST FRIDAY.\nTHE RESULTS REVEALED A SMALL RIGHT MIDDLE LOBE PNEUMONIA.\nTHEY ALSO SAY THIS WAS A MILD, NON-CONTAGIOUS BACTERIAL\nPNEUMONIA.

TALKS ABOUT A CT SCAN OF HER\nBRAIN THAT SHE HAD EARLIER THIS YEAR WHICH WAS REALLY IMPORTANT\nBECAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT BACK IN 2012.\nSHE HAD FALLEN AND HIT HER HEAD AT THAT POINT AND THE CT SCAN OF\nTHE BRAIN LOOKED -- HAD NO ABNORMALITIES.\nTHAT WAS IMPORTANT TO SEE AS WELL.\nTHEY ARE BOTH STILL JUST SUMMARY LETTERS, THOUGH.\nTHESE ARE NOT MEDICAL RECORDS, NEITHER ONE OF THEM.\nTHAT ONE'S SLIGHTLY MORE DETAILED BUT THIS IS -- HAS\nPLENTY OF INFORMATION PARTICULARLY ABOUT MR. TRUMP'S\nHEART STUFF. >> IN RELEASING THIS WHEN THE\nCAMPAIGN PUT THIS OUT, AND TO BE CLEAR, THIS IS THE CAMPAIGN'S\nRELEASE AND THAT IS THE DOCTOR'S LETTER THAT WE HAVE BUT IN THE\nCAMPAIGN'S RELEASE, SANJAY, THERE'S A LINE THAT JUMPED OUT\nAT US, WHEN THE CAMPAIGN WROTE WE ARE PLEASED TO DISCLOSE ALL\nTHE TEST RESULTS WHICH SHOW THAT MR. TRUMP IS IN EXCELLENT HEALTH\nAND HAS THE STAMINA TO ENDURE UNINTERRUPTED THE RIGORS OF A\nPUNISHING AND UNPRECEDENTED PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.\nIS THAT AN ASSESSMENT THAT CAN BE MADE FROM THE INFORMATION THE\nDOCTOR HANDED OUT? >> MEASURING STAMINA, MEASURING\nTHAT DEGREE OF PHYSICAL HEALTH OBVIOUSLY IS A VERY SUBJECTIVE\nTHING. BUT THEY HAVE BOTH BEEN DOING IT\nFOR SOME 18 MONTHS NOW. THEY HAVE BOTH BEEN DOING THIS,\nCRISSCROSSING THE COUNTRY, LOTS OF RALLIES, LOTS OF SPEECHES,\nALL THAT SORT OF STUFF. I GUESS THEY HAVE BOTH BEEN PUT\nTHROUGH THE RIGORS OF THIS ALREADY AND WITHSTOOD IT PRETTY\nWELL. IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE IN THE\nPREVIOUS LETTER, DR. BORNSTEIN SEEMS TO HAVE LEARNED A LITTLE\nBIT ABOUT PRESENTING THESE LETTERS.\nIN THE PREVIOUS LETTER HE WROTE AT THE END I CAN STATE\nUNEQUIVOCALLY MR. TRUMP WILL BE THE HEALTHIEST INDIVIDUAL EVER\nELECTED TO THE PRESIDENCY. NOW HE SAYS HE'S IN EXCELLENT\nPHYSICAL HEALTH. HE'S TONED IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT.\n>> SO THE DOCTOR DID THE PIVOT EVEN IF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN\nHASN'T. MEDICALLY SPEAKING, MAYBE NOT\nPOLITICALLY. FINALLY, JUST TO BE CLEAR, ONE\nOF THE THINGS DONALD TRUMP HAS SAID OVER TIME IS HE'S GOING TO\nRELEASE ALL HIS MEDICAL RECORDS, HILLARY CLINTON HAS SUGGESTED --\nTHIS IS NOT ALL MEDICAL RECORDS. THAT COULD ENTAIL MUCH, MUCH\nMORE FOR BOTH CANDIDATES? >> ABSOLUTELY.\nMY GUESS IS WE ARE NOT GOING TO SEE THAT.\nTHIS MAY BE IT. I THINK THIS MAY BE IT IN TERMS\nOF WHAT WE WILL SEE MEDICALLY. THE REASON I THINK IT'S\nIMPORTANT IS NOT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO RELENTLESSLY INVADE\nPRIVACY OR CAUSE EMBARRASSMENT. IT'S BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE\nINDEPENDENT PEOPLE LOOKING AT THESE MEDICAL RECORDS, THEY MAY\nDRAW CONCLUSIONS DIFFERENT FROM SOMEBODY WHO IS NOT ONLY A\nPHYSICIAN OF THE PATIENT, THE CANDIDATE, BUT ALSO IN SOME\nCASES A FRIEND. SOMETIMES YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT\nYOU DON'T KNOW. SO LOOKING AT THOSE MEDICAL\nRECORDS CAN SOMETIMES BE IMPORTANT.\nHAVING SAID THAT, I THINK THIS IS ALL WE ARE GOING TO GET AND\nAS I THINK BOTH CANDIDATES HAVE SUGGESTED, THIS IS SORT OF THE\nSTANDARD THAT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED OVER THE LAST COUPLE\nOF CYCLES. >> THIS IS THE ROMNEY/OBAMA\nSTANDARD. NOT THE McCAIN/DOLE STANDARD\nWHICH IS FOR OLDER CANDIDATES, BOTH OF WHICH THESE CANDIDATES\nARE. SANJAY, GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH\nUS. >> STICK AROUND.\nTHERE'S MORE PAPERS TO BE RELEASED.\n>> ALL THIS DOCTOR TALK IS HAPPENING AS ALL SIGNS POINT TO\nTHIS RACE BEING TIGHT AS A TICK, NECK AND NECK, TOO CLOSE TO CALL\nOR IN OTHER WORDS, TIED. A BRAND NEW CBS/\"NEW YORK TIMES\"\nPOLL SHOWS TRUMP AND CLINTON AT 42%.\nTHAT'S TIED. MEANWHILE, A NEW CNN/ORC POLL,\nTHEY HAVE TRUMP PULLING AHEAD IN TWO KEY BATTLEGROUND STATES.\nA SLIM LEAD IN FLORIDA AND FIVE-POINT LEAD IN OHIO.\nWANT TO GO NOW TO WHITE PLAINS, NEW YORK, WESTCHESTER AIRPORT,\nWHERE WE SEE JEFF ZELENY WAITING IN FRONT OF HILLARY CLINTON'S\nPLANE GETTING READY TO GO TO NORTH CAROLINA.\nGOOD MORNING. >> Reporter: GOOD MORNING.\nTHIS CAMPAIGN PLANE BEHIND ME, YOU CAN SEE THE WORDS STRONGER\nTOGETHER, HAS BEEN GROUNDED REALLY FOR THE LAST WEEK OR SO\nAS HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN RESTING AND RECOVERING FROM THAT\nBOUT OF PNEUMONIA. HER CAMPAIGN TRAIL HAS BEEN\nLIMITED TO HER HOUSE IN CHAPPAQUA JUST A SHORT DISTANCE\nFROM HERE. BUT SHE IS GOING TO BE LEAVING\nWITHIN THE NEXT HOUR OR A LITTLE BIT MORE TO FLY BACK TO NORTH\nCAROLINA, BACK TO THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\nIT IS SIGNIFICANT THAT THE LANDSCAPE HAS INDEED CHANGED\nSINCE SHE HAS BEEN LAID UP AT HER HOUSE.\nTHE NATIONAL POLL AS YOU MENTIONED FROM THE \"NEW YORK\nTIMES\" AND CBS SHOWS IT A VERY CLOSE RACE BUT IT'S THE\nBATTLEGROUND POLLS THAT IS CONCERNING THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN\nEVEN MORE. THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THEY HAVE LOST\nSOME TIME, LOST SOME GROUND. DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN ABLE TO --\nBEEN TRAVELING AROUND ALL OF THE COUNTRY THIS WEEK BUT THEY\nBELIEVE THEY CAN GET BACK ON THE OFFENSIVE MESSAGE THIS WEEK.\nDO NOT LOOK FOR A TIT FOR TAT ON MEDICAL RECORDS.\nI'M TOLD SECRETARY CLINTON IS GOING TO JUST BRIEFLY\nACKNOWLEDGE HER ILLNESS, THANK PEOPLE FOR THEIR WELL WISHES,\nBUT SHE IS GOING TO PUSH DONALD TRUMP ON THE TRANSPARENCY OF TAX\nRETURNS. THAT IS SOMETHING SHE STILL\nBELIEVES SHE HAS HIGHER GROUND ON AND SHE HAS INDEED RELEASED\nABOUT 40 YEARS' WORTH. HE OF COURSE HAS RELEASED ZERO.\nSHE IS GOING TO TRY TO REENGAGE IN THIS RACE TODAY BUT THE\nQUESTION IS, HOW IS HER HEALTH REALLY?\nSHE IS STILL UNDER DOCTORS' ORDERS, OF COURSE, STILL ON THAT\nMEDICINE AS WE KNOW, AND THAT FIRST DEBATE IS IN 11 DAYS.\nSO THE CAMPAIGN IS GOING TO TRY AND NOT OVERWORK HER, I'M TOLD.\nTHAT'S WHY SHE ONLY HAS ONE SPEECH TODAY IN NORTH CAROLINA\nAND THEN AN EVENING EVENT TONIGHT IN WASHINGTON.\nPRETTY LIMITED SCHEDULE FOR THE NEXT COMING DAYS HERE AS SHE\nTRIES TO GET BACK ON HER FEET AND BACK INTO THIS RACE, WHICH\nSUDDENLY IS A VERY TIGHT ONE, SOME 54 DAYS BEFORE ELECTION\nDAY. >> LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT\nLANDSCAPE SINCE SHE WENT OFF THE TRAIL.\nGREAT TO SEE YOU, THANK YOU. WE WERE WATCHING JEFF, WE WILL\nWATCH WITH JEFF TO SEE WHEN WE SEE HILLARY CLINTON MAKE HER\nAPPEARANCE. >> IT'S REALLY OUR FIRST CHANCE\nTO SEE HER SINCE SHE WENT HOME TO CHAPPAQUA.\n>>> MEANWHILE, WE ARE MOMENTS",

CAMPAIGNING IN NORTH CAROLINA\nTODAY AFTER THREE STRAIGHT DAYS AT HOME IN CHAPPAQUA RECOVERING\nFROM PNEUMONIA. THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN RELEASED A\nLETTER FROM HER DOCTOR OFFERING MORE INSIGHT INTO THE MEDICAL\nCONDITION. WE LEARNED THAT SHE IN ADDITION\nTO BE TREATED LAST FRIDAY FOR PNEUMONIA, SHE SAW THE DOCTOR\nFOR THE PERSISTENT COUGH ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\nSHE HAS BEEN TREATED FOR THAT AND IS ON MEDICATION FOR THE\nPNEUMONIA. THE QUESTION HERE IS ONE OF\nTRANSPARENCY. THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN\nACKNOWLEDGES THERE WERE MISSTEP HERE.\nSHE HAS BEEN WATCHING THIS FROM CHAPPAQUA.\nSHE HAS BEEN TRYING TO GET EVERYTHING STRAIGHT AFTER THE\nDOCTOR GIVING AN OVERVIEW TO HER CONDITION.\nMY IMPRESSION IS MR. CLINTON IS HEALTHY AND NOT DEVELOPED NEW\nMEDICAL CONDITIONS OTHER THAN SINUS AND EAR INFECTION AND\nPNEUMONIA. SHE IS RECOVERING WELL WITH\nANTIBIOTICS AND REST. SHE CONTINUES TO BE FIT AND\nHEALTHY TO SERVE AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HOPES THIS PUTS AN END TO IT AND PUTS\nPRESSURE ON DONALD TRUMP TO RELEASE INFORMATION.\nTHE CLINTONS REALIZED THEY LOST TIME HERE AND EAGER TO GET BACK\nTO CAMPAIGNING. ONE ADVISER TELLS ME HER HEALTH,\nTHAT FIRST DEBATE WITH TRUMP NOW 11 DAYS AWAY.\nCHRISTINE AND GEORGE. >> THAT LETTER, JEFF JUST\nMENTIONED DOES SERVE TO ANSWER SOME OPEN QUESTIONS ABOUT HER\nHEALTH. WE KNOW FROM THE LAST DOCTOR\nLETTER RELEASED IN 2015, CLINTON SUFFERED AN EAR INFECTION THAT\nREQUIRED DRAINING FLUID. A C.A.T. SCAN OF HER BRAIN.\nSHE ALSO HAD A C.A.T. SCAN OF HER HEART SHOWING SHE IS AT LOW\nRISK OF HEART DISEASE. IT INCLUDES MEDICATION FOR\nHYPOTHYROIDISM. OUR CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT\nDR. SANJAY GUPTA HAS MORE. >> CHRISTINE AND GEORGE, WE HAVE\nMORE CLARITY, FOR EXAMPLE, AS TO WHAT HAPPENED THIS PAST WEEK\nWITH SECRETARY CLINTON AND DIAGNOSIS OF PNEUMONIA.\nWE KNOW SHE GOT A C.A.T. SCAN ON FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 9th THAT\nSHOWED THE INFECTION OF HER LUNG AND STARTED ANTIBIOTICS.\nSHE HAD FEVERS AND COUGHING FITS THAT HAD BEEN PRETTY WELL\nDESCRIBED. CHRISTINE AND GEORGE, WE HAVE\nMORE INFORMATION FROM SECRETARY CLINTON THAN MR. TRUMP.\nTHESE ARE NOT MEDICAL RECORDS. THESE ARE SUMMARIES OF RECORDS.\nSOMEONE WHO IS INTERPRETING THEM AND DELIVERING THEM TO US.\nWE CAN TAKE THEM FOR WHAT THEY ARE.\nPART OF THE REASON PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR MEDICAL RECORDS\nIS TO HAVE A MORE DISPASSIONATE UNBIASSED LOOK AT THE RECORDS TO\nDETERMINE THE HEALTH OF THE CANDIDATES.\nDR. BARDACK SAID IN HER MIND THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT\nSECRETARY CLINTON IS FIT TO LEAD, HOWEVER.\nCHRISTINE, GEORGE. >> SANJAY, THANK YOU FOR THAT.\nDONALD TRUMP HOSTING A RALLY IN OHIO AFTER SOFT PEDALING, HE\nTARGETED THE SUBJECT OF CLINTON'S HEALTH SINCE SHE FELL\nILL OVER THE WEEKEND. >> I DON'T KNOW, FOLKS.\nYOU THINK HILLARY WOULD BE ABLE TO STAND UP HERE FOR AN HOUR AND\nDO THIS? I DON'T KNOW.\nI DON'T THINK SO. I DON'T THINK SO.\nNOW WE HAVE ONE LEFT AND IN ALL FAIRNESS, SHE IS LYING IN BED\nGETTING BETTER. WE WANT HER BETTER AND BACK ON\nTHE TRAIL. RIGHT?\nWE WANT HER BACK ON THE TRAIL. >> TRUMP'S HEALTH IS A MYSTERY\nEVEN AFTER A MADE FOR TV MOMENT AFTER SURPRISING DR. OZ AT THE\nTAPING OF \"THE DR. OZ SHOW.\" THE REPORTERS WERE NOT ALLOWED\nIN THE SHOW. LET'S BRING IN SUNLEN SERFATY\nWHO IS TRAVELING WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.\n>> Reporter: GOOD MORNING, GEORGE AND CHRISTINE.\nQUESTIONS SWIRL AROUND HIS CAMPAIGN.\nDONALD TRUMP IS RELEASING DETAILS ABOUT HIS HEALTH TODAY.\nTHE RESULTS OF THAT PHYSICAL HE HAD LAST WEEK.\nTRUMP ALSO SITTING DOWN TO DISCUSS HIS HEALTH IN AN\nINTERVIEW THAT WAS TAPED ON WEDNESDAY WITH DR. OZ.\nTHAT INTERVIEW WILL AIR IN FULL TODAY.\nSOME AUDIENCE MEMBERS TOLD CNN THAT TRUMP SAYS HE DOESN'T\nEXERCISE OF MUCH. HE WOULD LIKE TO LOSE BETWEEN 15\nAND 20 POUNDS. HE TAKES STATIN DRUGS TO HELP\nLOWER CHOLESTEROL. HERE IS MORE WHAT TRUMP TOLD DR.\nOZ. HE BELIEVES HE FEELS GOOD AND\nHAS THE STAMINA. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT STAMINA.\nYOU USE THAT WORD A LOT. YOU ARE ARGUING THE PRESIDENT\nHAS TO HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF STAMINA.\nIF ELECTED, AT AGE 70, YOU WOULD BE THE OLDEST TO ENTER THE\nOF OFFICE.\n>> JUST ABOUT THE SAME AGE AS RONALD REAGAN AND HILLARY IS A\nYEAR BEHIND ME. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS MAKES\nSENSE, BUT I FEEL AS GOOD TODAY AS WHEN I WAS 30.\n>> Reporter: THIS IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THE DONALD TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN IS RELEASING THE MEDICAL SUMMARY, IT IS NOT THE\nFULL RELEASE OF WHAT THAT PHYSICAL SHOWS NOR IS IT THE\nFULL DETAIL OF TRUMP'S MEDICAL RECORDS.\nFAR LESS DETAILED THAN WHAT NOMINEES RELEASED.\nSTILL LACKING A FULL AND COMPLETE PICTURE OF TRUMP'S\nHEALTH. >> SUNLEN, THANK YOU.\nAN AWKWARD MOMENT FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nIN FLINT, MICHIGAN, WHILE ADDRESSING WORSHIPPERS AT THE\nBETHEL UNITED METHODIST CHURCH, THE PASTOR WHO HOSTED TRUMP\nINTERRUPTED HIM MID SENTENCE. LISTEN.\n>> HILLARY FAILED ON THE ECONOMY.\nJUST LIKE SHE'S FAILED ON FOREIGN POLICY.\nEVERYTHING SHE TOUCHED DID NOT WORK OUT.\nNOTHING. >> MR. TRUMP, I INVITED YOU HERE\nTO -- NOT TO GIVE A POLITICAL SPEECH.\n>> THAT'S GOOD. I'LL GET BACK TO IT.\nOKAY. >> THE REVEREND SAYS ALL PEOPLE\nARE WELCOME AT HER CHURCH, BUT POINTED OUT TRUMP'S PRESENCE DID\nNOT REPRESENT AN ENDORSEMENT. >>> HILLARY CLINTON'S DIP IN THE\nPOLLS OVER HONESTY AND",

SHE AND DONALD TRUMP HAS SINCE\nRELEASED NEW DETAILS ABOUT THEIR MEDICAL HISTORY WHICH APPEAR TO\nSHOW THEY ARE BOTH FIT TO SERVE AS PRESIDENT.\nAND WHILE DONALD TRUMP HAD REFRAINED FROM MAKING HILLARY\nCLINTON'S HEALTH A POLITICAL ISSUE, YESTERDAY HE TOOK A DIG.\n>> IT IS HOT WHEN I ALWAYS PERFORM BECAUSE THE CROWDS ARE\nSO BIG, THESE ROOMS WERE NOT DESIGNED FOR THIS KIND OF A\nCROWD.

I DON'T THINK SO.\nSANDRA: BUT THE FOLKS WHO KNOW HILLARY BEST COMING TO HER\nDEFENSE. DAUGHTER CHELSEA TELLING A LOCAL\nREPORTER ABOUT HER MOM'S TIRELESS DEDICATION TO CARRY ON.\n>> I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN HER SO TIRED AND SHE WAS TIRED\nBECAUSE SHE HAS PNEUMONIA, I'VE HAD PNEUMONIA TWICE.\nTHE FACT THAT SHE DIDN'T TELL ME AND I TALK TO MY MOM EVERY DAY\nAND I'M CLOSE TO HER IS PRETTY MUCH REVEAL THAT IS SHE THOUGHT\nIT WASN'T A BIG DEAL AND SHE THOUGHT THAT SHE COULD BE GOING.\nSANDRA: HER HUSBAND SHRUGING IT OFF.\n>> I JUST TALK TODAY -- TALKED TO HER.\nLAST TIME I CHECKED MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WERE GETTING EVERY YEAR.\nSANDRA: WHAT? [LAUGHTER]\nBILL:  I WASN'T LISTENING. WHAT DID HE SAY?\nSANDRA: HE TALKED ABOUT THE FLU. THAT'S BESIDES THE POINT.\nHOW IMPORTANT ARE THE CANDIDATES' HEALTH, BILL?\nBILL:  I THINK THEY ARE IMPORTANT FOR THE LONG RUN BUT\nALL OF THE DIAGNOSIS BY PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE\nTALKING ABOUT INSULT IT IS VIEWERS AND THE READERS.\nI MEAN, WE DON'T KNOW. SANDRA: YOU MEAN THE\nSPECULATION? BILL:  IT'S RIDICULOUS.\nI HAVE A LETTER, WHAT ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S PARKINSON'S?\nYOU KNOW WHAT, THIS IS JUST CRAZY.\nI ADMIRE BOTH CANDIDATES. I THINK THAT THEY HAVE SHOWN\nINCREDIBLE STAMINA UNDER PRESSURE AND THEY MOVE ALL OVER\nTHE PLACE. NORMAL HUMAN BEINGS COULDN'T DO\nIT AND I THINK, THOUGH, THAT THEY ALL SHOULD-BOTH OF THEM\nSHOULD RELEASE MEDICAL RECORDS, ALL RIGHT, FROM THEIR PHYSICALS\nSO THAT PEOPLE CAN SEE BECAUSE GOOD HEALTH IS A VERY, VERY\nSTRONG COMPONENT IN LEADERSHIP. SANDRA: AT LEAST IF HILLARY\nCLINTON DID THAT IT WOULD REMOVE THE ABILITY -- ALL THE\nSPECULATION THAT BILL IS TALKING ABOUT IS THERE BECAUSE SHE WON'T\nTELL US. >> HER HEALTH HAD BEEN SOMEWHAT\nIN QUESTION AND THEN THEIR CONSPIRACIES UNFORTUNATELY FOR\nHER WENT MAINSTREAM.

WE KNOW FROM THE EMAILS THAT\nWENT BACK AND FORTH THAT WERE DISCOVERED THAT HILLARY CLINTON\nTOLD CHELSEA THAT BENGHAZI WAS TERRORISM AND SHE'S NOT GOING TO\nTELL HER ABOUT HER OWN PNEUMONIA.\nSANDRA: SHE DIDN'T TELL HER DAUGHTER AND SHE WAS GOING TO\nVISIT HER TWO BABIES. >> WE WILL SEE SOMETHING\nRELEASED AND YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP ON DR. OZ TODAY.\nI'M WONDERING, BILL, WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO PUT -- ARE YOU\nLAUGHING AT WHAT I'M SAYING? BILL:  DR. OZ, I THOUGHT HE\nLIVED LIVED LIVED LIVED LIVED IN EMERALD CITY.\n>> PUT THIS TO BED? BILL:  NOTHING.\nRIGHT. SO I'M JUST ASSUMING THEY'RE\nBOTH IN GOOD HEALTH AND, YOU KNOW, YOU GO TO THE POLL AND YOU\nVOTE FOR WHO YOU THINK IS NOT GOING TO DAMAGE THE COUNTRY.\nI MEAN, THAT'S WHAT IT IS. PEOPLE ARE VOTING AGAINST NOT\nRATHER THAN FOR. 66% ACCORDING TO NEW QUINNIPIAC\nOF ALL VOTERS, 66% SAY I'M NOT VOTING FOR ANYBODY, I'M VOTING\nAGAINST THAT PERSON. EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE LEARNED\nABOUT THE HEALTH OR WHAT WE LEARNED YET, IN HILLARY'S CASE\nHAS IT CHANGED ANYBODY'S MIND IN THIS CASE?\n>> NO, CERTAINLY NOT. EVERYBODY IS VOTING AGAINST\nSOMEBODY. >> UNTIL RECENTLY SOME PUT\nFORWARD REAL POLICY PRESCRIPTIONS.\nWHAT DOES A DOCTOR FROM -- PEOPLE, ARE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE\nANY LETTER FROM THE PHYSICIAN. THEY ARE GOING TO BELIEVE WHAT\nTHEY SEE ON THE TRAIL AND A LOT WITH THIS DEBATE COMING UP.\nTO ME IT'S GOING TO BE A FIRST-HAND LOOK FOR AMERICANS TO\nDECIDE FOR THEMSELVES WHAT STAMINA LOOKS LIKE AND WHAT TYPE\nOF SHAPE THESE PEOPLE ARE REALLY IN.\nSANDRA: STAMINA IS ANOTHER THING.\nTRUMP HAS ON HILLARY CLINTON THAT SHE DOESN'T HAVE STAMINA TO\nMAKE IT TO THE RACE.

THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TAX\nRETURNS AND MEDICAL RECORDS. IF SHE HAS LEPROSY WE NEED TO\nKNOW ABOUT IT. MILLER SAID LAST NIGHT ON MY\nPROGRAM THAT IT LOOKED LIKE SHE WAS THROWN IN THE VAN LIKE A\nSACK OF ROCK SOIL. THAT'S NOT THE IMAGE THAT SHE\nWANTS. IF I'M HILLARY CLINTON, I GET MY\nMEDICAL STUFF OUT THERE AS SOON AS I CAN.\nSANDRA: TRUMP LEADING IN KEY BATTLEGROUND STATES, SHOULD\nHILLARY BE WORRIED?

IT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT.\nAND I THINK POWELL WAS VERY UPSET THAT HE WAS USED IN\nA PUBLIC WAY BY THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN.\n>> THAT CAME OUT OBVIOUSLY IN THE E-MAILS THAT HE DIDN'T WANT\nTO BE DRAGGED INTO IT.

STILL WHEN TOLL BROTHERS NUMBER\nONE LUXURY HOME BUILDER IN THIS COMPANY REPORTED A FEW WEEKS\nAGO, THEY TOTALLY KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE PARK.\nIT WENT FROM 29 TO 31. WHAT GOT PEOPLE SO EXCITED?\nTOLL DELIVERS A NICE TOP LINE BEAT BUT MORE IMPORTANT,\nHEADLINE NUMBERS. THEY MATTERED, BUT IT WAS THE\n18% INCREASE IN NET SIGNING CONTRACTS, 90% INCREASE IN THEIR\nBACKLOG. I THOUGHT THAT WAS AMAZING AND\nTHE FACT THAT MANAGEMENT GAVE BULLISH FULL YEAR GUIDANCE.\nSINCE THEN, TOLL BROTHERS HAS PULLED BACK TO THE POINT WHERE\nITS STOCK IS NOW TRADING BELOW WHERE IT WAS BEFORE IT REPORTED,\nLIKE THE PAST QUARTER NEVER HAPPENED.\nSOME OF THAT IS ANXIETY ABOUT A POSSIBLE RATE HIKE BUT GIVEN THE\nSTOCK IS ALREADY DOWN 13% YEAR-TO-DATE, I GOT TO WONDER IF\nIT COULD BE JUST A BUY. THE CEO OF TOLL BROTHERS, FIND\nOUT HOW HIS COMPANY. MR. YEARLY, WELCOME TO \"MAD\nMONEY.\" I'VE FOLLOWED YOUR COMPANY SINCE\nIT BECAME PUBLIC AND YOU KNOW I KNOW BOB TOLL.\n>> YEAH. >> AND YOU'RE A PHILLY GUY.\n>> YES, I AM. HE'S A HUGE EAGLE FAN LIKE ME.\nTHE ONE THING THAT HAS SHOCKED ME IS THAT THE WHOLE TIME, YOU\nGUYS HAVE NEVER REALLY BEEN BIG BUYERS OF STOCK.\nTHIS YEAR, IT'S AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF STOCK YOU'RE BUYING.\nTELL US WHY YOU SWITCHED DIRECTIONS AND JUST THINK THAT\nTHE STOCK'S TOO CHEAP AND YOU GOT TO BUY.\n>> WE BOUGHT BACK ABOUT 7% OF OUR STOCK IN THE FIRST THREE\nQUARTERS OF 16. IT WAS THE OPPORTUNITY.\nOUR BOOK VALUE IS IN THE HIGH 20s.\nOUR STOCK WAS TRADING IN THE HIGH 20s.\nWE HAVE SOME OF THE BEST GROWTH IN THE INDUSTRY RIGHT NOW.\nORDER GROWTH IS LEADING THE INDUSTRY OR UP THERE AT THE TOP.\nOUR EARNINGS ARE AT THE TOP. OUR MARGINS ARE AT THE TOP.\nTHERE'S BEEN THIS FEAR ABOUT LUXURY THAT WE'RE NOT SEEING IN\nTHIS BUSINESS. WE SAW WHERE THE STOCK PRICE WAS\nLAYING AROUND AND THIS YEAR WAS THE TIME TO BUY A WHOLE BUNCH\nBACK. >> WE HAVE A LOT OF RETAIL\nINVESTORS. WHEN YOU SAY BOOK VALUE, WHAT\nYOU'RE SAYING IS BASICALLY WHAT THIS COMPANY IS WORTH, ITS LAND,\nITS PROSPECTS. >> THAT'S RIGHT.\nIF WE HAVE THE LEADING MARGIN IN THE INDUSTRY, YOU WOULD THINK\nOUR BOOK IS PRETTY SECURE. >> YES.\nTHAT'S WHAT'S CONFUSING ME. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANT TO\nGO OVER, YOU MENTIONED ABOUT THE HIGH END.\nWHAT IS THE SENSITIVITY BOTH TO THE HIGH END BECAUSE THAT'S\nWHERE YOU ARE, AND THEN TO THE OTHER END WHERE SOME OF THESE\nSTOCKS ARE DOING MUCH BETTER THAN YOURS, BUT I CAN'T FIGURE\nIT? AN INCREASE, SAY, OF A HALF A\nPOINT IN MORTGAGE RATES. WHO DOES IT HURT MORE?\n>> IT HURTS THE LOWER END MORE BECAUSE IT COMES DOWN TO\nAFFORDABILITY. IT COMES DOWN TO DOLLARS AND\nCENTS OF WHAT THEY CAN AFFORD IN A GIVEN MONTH.\nDO THEY CONTINUE TO RENT, OR IS THE RATE SUCH THAT THEY CAN\nAFFORD TO OWN? OUR BUYERS DON'T MAX OUT THEIR\nMORTGAGES. OUR AVERAGE LTV IS 70 PSHSZ, 20%\nOF OUR BUYERS ARE ALL CASH. THIS IS THEIR SECOND, THIRD,\nFOURTH HOME THEY'RE BUYING IN THEIR LIFE.\nWHILE A MAJOR MOVE IN RATE WOULD HURT US, A SMALL TICK WILL HAVE\nNO IMPACT. I'VE ALWAYS SAID I WILL TAKE A\nRATE THAT'S 4%, 4.25% IN A STRONG ECONOMY OVER 3.5% RATE\nWHERE WE'VE BEEN FOR A LONG TIME.\n>> RIGHT. >> IN AN ECONOMY THAT IS NOT AS\nGOOD. SO WHEN THE FED TALKS ABOUT\nMAYBE THERE'S A RATE INCREASE AND THE BUILDERS SELL OFF, THAT,\nTO ME IS GOOD NEWS THERE MIGHT BE A SMALL RATE INCREASE BECAUSE\nTHE ECONOMY IS STRONG, YET THE MARKET IS REACTING SHORT TERM\nWITH A SELL. >> ARE YOU STILL BUYING STOCK?\n>> WE HAVEN'T BOUGHT ANY YET THIS QUARTER.\n>> OKAY. >> BUT WE WILL CERTAINLY\nCONTINUE TO BE IN THE MARKET, AND YOU WILL SEE US CONTINUE\nWHEN THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTS ITSELF TO BUY STOCK BACK.\n>> IS THERE NEWS THAT IS GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO BUY IT?\n>> WE'RE ALWAYS BOUNCING LAND OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE WITH THE\nMONEY WE HAVE BECAUSE THAT'S OUR GROWTH.\n>> RIGHT. >> VERSUS STOCK BUY BACK, AND WE\nWILL CONTINUE TO BALANCE. >> LET'S TALK AROUND THE\nCOUNTRY. CALIFORNIA, HOW IS IT.\n>> FABULOUS. >> REALLY?\n>> FABULOUS. WE'RE IN COASTAL CALIFORNIA,\nNORTHERN AND SOUTHERN. WE'RE NOT INLAND.\n>> OKAY. >> WE DID A HUGE DEAL TWO YEARS\nAGO WHEN WE BOUGHT CHAPPELLE, $1.6 BILLION, WHICH IT\nTRANSFORMED THE COMPANY. WE NOW HAVE 25% OF OUR BUSINESS\nCOMING OUT OF CALIFORNIA. ORANGE COUNTY, L.A. COUNTY,\nVENTURA COUNTY, SOUTH BAY AND EAST BAY OF SAN FRANCISCO,\nFABULOUS. >> AVERAGE PRICE OF THOSE\nPLACES? >> 1.2 MILLION TO 1.5 MILLION ON\nAVERAGE. >> THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM?\n>> WE'RE KILLING. >>.\n>> HOW ABOUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY?\n>> OUR BEST MARKET IS DETROIT. NOT A LOT OF JOB GROWTH IN THE\nMIDWEST. WE'RE ALSO IN MINNEAPOLIS,\nCHICAGO. WE LIKE WHAT'S GOING ON IN\nMICHIGAN. THERE'S BEEN MORE JOB GROWTH AS\nTHE AUTO COMPANIES HAVE DONE BETTER, BUT THAT'S NOT A BIG\nGROWTH TERRITORY FOR US. >> FLORIDA?\n>> FLORIDA IS GOOD. WE NEED MORE LAND.\nVERY HARD TO FIND LAND. WE'RE DOING VERY WELL IN\nJACKSONVILLE. WE'RE DOING VERY WELL IN\nORLANDO, WHICH TEND TO BE PRIMARY HOME MARKETS.\nAND THEN THE SECOND HOME MARKET AND THE RETIREMENT AREAS OF THE\nGOLD COAST OF THE EAST AND THE WEST COAST, THEY'RE GOOD.\nWE JUST NEED MORE LAND. >> THEN ROUND CIRCLE FROM WHAT\nHA BEEN NOT THAT GREAT, NORTHEAST, GREAT.\n>> NORTHEAST IS GREAT. YOU KNOW, WE DOMINATE BOSTON TO\nWASHINGTON. THAT'S OUR HOME TURF.\nWE'RE OUT OF PHILADELPHIA. VERY FEW BIG NATIONAL BUILDERS\nARE THERE, SO WE TEND TO DOMINATE THE LAND BUYING.\nWE HAVE A GREAT BRAND BECAUSE WE GREW UP THERE.\n>> RIGHT. >> IT'S HARD TO FIND LAND.\nIT'S HARD TO GROW BECAUSE IT'S SO DIFFICULT TO GET LAND\nENTITLED. IT MAY TAKE FIVE YEARS IN NEW\nJERSEY TO GET A FARM APPROVED FOR HOUSES.\nWHEN YOU GET IT, IT'S GOLD. >> I WANTED TO ASK YOU, I'VE\nBEEN LOOKING AT THIS APPLE HOME KIT.\nIS THAT SOMETHING -- IS IT TOLL BROTHERS OUTFITTED\nELECTRONICALLY TO BE ABLE TO DO THE KIND OF HOME KIT THINGS THAT\nWE SEE? >> WE DO A LOT OF IT.\nWE DON'T USE APPLE RIGHT NOW. WE'RE LOOKING INTO THAT.\nWE USE ANOTHER COMPANY CALLED CONTROL 4.\nBUT WE'RE ALL OVER IT. >> LAST QUESTION.\nTHE FORTUNE RANKINGS WERE PRETTY AMAZING.\nTELL PEOPLE WHAT YOU ARE AND HOW THAT HAPPENED.\n>> \"FORTUNE\" MAGAZINE RANK TSZ THE MOST ADMIRED COMPANIES BY\nINDUSTRY AND WE'VE BEEN WINNING IN HOME BUILDING.\nTHEN THEY RANK WORLDWIDE OF ALL INDUSTRIES FOR THE QUALITY OF\nPRODUCT. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN LITTLE TOLL\nBROTHERS OUT OF PHILADELPHIA IS NUMBER 6 ON THIS LIST WORLDWIDE.\nTHE ONLY COMPANIES IN THE WORLD AHEAD OF US ARE APPLE, AMAZON,\nNORDSTROM, GOOGLE, AND DISNEY. THAT'S IT.\nAND THEN TOLL. >> I THOUGHT THAT WAS AMAZING.\nYOU'RE THE MOST OPTIMISTIC I'VE HEARD YOU, AND I HEAR YOU IN ALL\nDIFFERENT VENUES, THAT I CAN RECALL.\n>> YOU KNOW, JIM, WE ANNOUNCED THREE WEEKS AGO, THREE WEEKS\nINTO OUR NEW QUARTER, THAT OUR DEPOSITS, WHICH IS AN INDICATOR\nOF WHAT'S COMING BECAUSE IT'S WHEN SOMEBODY PUTS A CHECK DOWN\nON A LOT, WERE UP 23% FOR THOSE THREE WEEKS.\nWE'RE NOW THREE WEEKS FURTHER IN.\nWE ARE UP 25%. >> THAT'S GREAT NEWS.\nTHAT'S NEWS. >> WE'RE ROLLING.\n>> ALL RIGHT. THAT'S GREAT NEWS, AND I DID NOT\nKNOW THAT. THANK YOU SO OFF FOR SHARING IT\nWITH OUR VIEWERS.

LISTEN, I'M A BIT SKEPTICAL\nHERE, NOT BY THE PRICE ACTION, BUT BY THE IDEA THAT YOU'RE\nASSIGNING TOO MUCH VALUE ON WHAT SPRINT AND WHAT T-MOBILE SAID\nAND WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT VERIZON AND A IT T ASK T SAID,\nWHO ARE THE CLEAR BIG DAD EASE AS FAR AS U.S. CARRIERS ARE\nCONCERNED, IT WAS NOT AS MOMENTOUS AND THERE ARE NO\nNUMBERS ATTACHED. JUST BECAUSE T-MOBILE, THE\nTHIRD-LARGEST CARRIER IN THE U.S. SAYS THEY'RE UP FOR X --\nTHERE ARE SUBSCRIBERS WHO HAVE GONE FROM $23 MILLION IN 2013 TO\n$31 MILLION. THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR\nTHEM TO GET PEOPLE TO SWITCH FROM OTHER CARRIERS.\nAND THEY'RE DOING TRADE-INS, ALL OF THIS STUFF.\nTO ME, THAT'S ALL GOOD FOR APPLE.\nBUT IT'S NOT -- EASY, I THINK, TO EXTRAPOLATE TO WHAT'S\nREQUESTING GOING ON WITH 150 MILLION SUBS THAT AT&T AND\nVERIZON HAVE. >> ONE OTHER THING, THOUGH.\nWE TALKED ABOUT THE DISCIPLINE OF NOT PUTTING SO MUCH EFFORT\nINTO THE CAR -- THE CAR BUSINESS, I THINK, IS SMART.\n>> SO COST DISCIPLINE. YEAH.\n>> AND PART OF THE ARGUMENT TODAY, WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT\nRBCs PUT OUT THERE -- THIS IS SOMETHING WE HAVE BEEN POUNDING\nTHE TABLE FOR A LONG TIME. PARTIALLY THE ECOSYSTEM, AS\nWELL. ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT ELEMENTS\nTO WHAT APPLE IS DOING. I'M NOT PUTTING ALL THAT MUCH ON\nTHE T-MOBILE THING. I'M SAYING IT'S INTERESTING,\nBECAUSE EVERYBODY WENT INTO THIS AND SAID THIS IS A DUD.\nTHERE IS NOTHING THERE. AND MEANWHILE, ONE OF THE CHIP\nMAKERS THAT SUPPLY TO APPLE, WHAT HAVE THEY SAID SINCE THE\nEND OF JULY? JUST ABOUT EVERY ONE OF THEM\nTHAT'S VERY DEPENDENT ON APPLE, SOME OF THESE SKYWORKS, YOU LOOK\nAT WHAT THEIR NUMBERS ARE AND YOU SAY, HOLY SMOKES, THEY HAVE\nBEEN TELLING US THAT DEMAND FROM APPLE IS STRONG.\nAND SO IF THAT'S THE CASE, AND WE ALL KNOW THAT TLS, WHEN YOU\nLOOK AT SOME OF THE NUMBERS COMING OUT OF THOSE CHIP MAKERS,\nTHAT SAYS A LOT ABOUT WHERE THIS PHONE IS, AS WELL.\nSO TO YOUR POINT SAYING, WELL, AT&T -- I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO\nBE VERY, VERY SURPRISED WHEN THE NUMBERS ACTUALLY COME OUT.\n>> I THINK THIS IS A MARKET PHENOMENON.\nTHIS IS TOTALLY A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE -- OVERWHELMED BY\nVALUATIONS. EVERYONE IS TELLING THEM HOW\nCOULD YOU OWN STOCKS, HOW COULD YOU OWN BONDS?\nI GET BACK TO WHAT I SAID. PLUS YOU ADD IN THE PART --\nTHINK ABOUT WHERE APPLE IS IN ITS PRODUCT CYCLE AND CALENDAR.\nWE'RE GOING IN THE BEST TWO QUARTERS.\nNO REASON WHY APPLE SHOULD HAVE BEEN RALLYING THE LAST SIX\nMONTHS. IT'S NOT THAT IT WAS AN\nUNDERWHELMING iPHONE 7. >> WASN'T A GREAT PERIOD FOR\nAPPLE AND ALL THESE OTHER -- STARS ARE ALIGNING.\n>> SO IF THE CAMERA IS A LITTLE BIT LATER, WHAT I'VE ALWAYS\nSAID, A MASSIVE REFRESH BASE AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S ALWAYS\nA WIND. >> IF YOU WERE SELLING AT STOCK\nAT 103 MONDAY MORNING, THE IDEA OF BUYING AT 111 RIGHT NOW\nDOESN'T MAKE A HECK OF A LOT OF SENSE.\nI HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS FOR A WHILE.\nI WAS VERY WRONG ON NEAR-TERM PRICE ACTION A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.\nI TOOK IT OFF TODAY. WHEN YOU SEE THE PRICE ACTION\nTHAT IT HAD HERE, YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE BETTING AGAINST IT.\nI WOULD BE REALLY SHOCKED AND I KNOW PETE SAW THIS ACTION.\nTHE MOST ACTIVE OPTIONS IN APPLE TODAY, THE OCTOBER 130 CALLS.\nMANY BEING BOUGHT. THIS IS A VERY LOW PROBABILITY\nBET. THINK ABOUT WHAT THE HIGH IN\n2014 WAS. IT WAS BACK AT 133, 134.\nAND IT'S AN EASY WAY TO LEVER OFF AN EXISTING LONG POSITION.\nBUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S GOING STRAIGHT BACK THERE, JUST\nBECAUSE IT'S -- >> IS THIS THE LAW OF LARGE\nNUMBERS FOR THE STOCK IN? I KIND OF FEEL LIKE YOU'VE HAD\nTHIS MARKET CAP MOVE. THAT'S A HUGE MOVE.\nI'M SAYING THIS IS IT. >> CONTINUE OR WHAT?\n>> I'M VERY -- I'M VERY NEUTRAL. IF MILDLY BULLISH ON APPLE.\nI'M JUST TELLING YOU, AFTER THIS MOVE AT 114, YOU HAVE MASSIVE\nRESISTANCE. JUST GOTTEN THROUGH AT LEAST THE\nBEST WEEK. SAMSUNG EFFECT, IT'S EVER GOING\nTO BE FROM A MARKET PERSPECTIVE. >> SO WE'RE SEEING THE BEST\nRIGHT NOW. YOU BRING LAW OF  LARGE NUMBERS.\n>> THIS IS NOT A STOCK I'M BUYING TOMORROW.\n>> ALL RIGHT. OKAY.\nSO THIS GOT US THINKING BACK AT THE OLD ENGLEWOOD CLIFFS ABOUT\nAPPLE. RELATIVE TO OTHER TECH TITANS.\nWE'RE GOING TO PLAY OUR FAVORITE GAME.\n\"WOULD YOU RATHER.\" WOULD YOU RATHER AMONGST TECH\nTITANS. APPLE OR FACEBOOK?\nPETE. >> RIGHT NOW, I SAID AT THE VERY\nTOP OF THE SHOW, I DON'T THINK IT'S A MUST-BUY, NECESSARILY.\nI DID BUY T BECAUSE I LIKE IT. BUT IF YOU GIVE ME THE CHOICE\nBETWEEN THOSE TWO NAMES RIGHT NOW, I THINK THERE IS MORE\nMOMENTUM UNDER ZUCKERBERG. MORE THINGS IN THE PIPELINE\nUNDER ZUCKERBERG. THE ACQUISITIONS HE'S MADE, I\nWOULD GO WITH FACEBOOK. >> FOR MY BOOK, A MUCH BIGGER\nBET IN FACEBOOK BY A LOT THAN APPLE.\nFOR -- >> ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THAT,\nI DON'T OWN FACEBOOK, AND I HAVE OWNED APPLE AND CONTINUE TO\nOWN -- ADDED TO APPLE. SO I GUESS I'M TALKING AGAINST\nMY BOOK RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE I SHOULD BE MORE\nPOSITIONED IN FACEBOOK THAN I AM.\n>> WHY ISN'T YOUR BOOK ALIGNED WITH WHAT YOU JUST SAID?\n>> BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE RUN THAT FACEBOOK HAD, JUST LIKE\nAPPLE, THIS RUN HAS BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY FAST UP TO THESE\nPARTICULAR LEVELS, CALL IT 130. SO THAT'S BEEN A FAST RUN TOO.\nI EXPECT SOME SORT OF A PULLBACK OUT OF FACEBOOK, AS WELL.\nTIM IS TALKING ABOUT APPLE, MAYBE AS IF PEAKING OUT.\nI DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE. BECAUSE WHEN I LOOK AT APPLE,\nTHE ONE DIFFERENCE IS VALUATION. BUT I THINK IN TERMS OF THE MOST\nMOMENTUM, I THINK YOU LOOK AT FACEBOOK.\n>> NEXT UP HERE, WOULD YOU RATHER APPLE OR GOOGLE?\nTIM. >> GOOGLE.\nAND MY BOOK SAYS THAT. I'M LONG GOOGLE.\nI DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON APPLE.\nI THINK GOOGLE IN THIS ENVIRONMENT, WHERE PEOPLE ARE\nSTRING GENTLY LOOKING AT STOCKS, A PHENOMENAL BALANCE SHEET.\nBUT IN TERMS OF INVASION AND PLACES WHERE YOU CAN HAVE UP\nSIDE AND YOUTUBE AS WE SAID ALL THESE THINGS ABOUT FACEBOOK, I\nTHINK YOU'VE GOT THAT SAME EXPOSURE WITH GOOGLE.\nAND YET YOU'VE GOT A CORED CASH GENERATED BUSINESS LIKE APPLE.\nMAYBE PRICED IN RELATIVE GROWTH TERMS, ACTUALLY, BETTER THAN\nAPPLE. SO GOOGLE.\n>> DAN? >> I AGREE WITH THAT.\nI THINK GOOGLE, YOU KNOW, RELATIVE TO THEIR EXPECTED\nGROWTH, NORTH OF 20% FOR EPS AND SALES TOO AT -- WHERE IT'S\nTRADING HERE TO ME, MAKES TOTAL SENSE.\nTHAT BEING SAID, I'M GOING TO TELL YOU GUYS THIS.\nYOU MAY FALL OFF YOUR CHAIRS HERE.\nI WAS VERY NEAR READY TO BUY APPLE.\n>> WHEN? >> IF IT GOT TO A NINE HANDLE.\n>> WHY DIDN'T YOU, THOUGH? WHY --\n>> CAN I JUST SAY SOMETHING? AND I MEAN THIS SERIOUSLY.\nI AM NOT ALL HYPED UP ABOUT THIS CYCLE.\nI THINK WHAT'S REALLY GOING TO HAPPEN, IF THEY EVER HAVE A HIT\nON THE WEARABLE FRONT AND THEN WE GET TOWARDS THAT TEN-YEAR\nANNIVERSARY OF THE iPHONE, THAT'S GOING TO BE A BIG FOCUS.\nI DO NOT THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE A BIG UPGRADE CYCLE.\nSO I WOULD NOT BE BEING IT AT 112, 113, AND CLOSED AT 111.\nGOOGLE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BREAK OUT.\nI DO THINK THAT APPLE HAS THE -- THE POTENTIAL TO DISAPPOINT AND\nGO BACK BELOW 100 BUCKS, WHERE IT ALMOST WAS MONDAY MORNING.\n>> LAST UP, APPLE OR MICROSOFT. PETE.\n>> I STILL THINK HE'S GOT A FEW THINGS UP HIS SLEEVE.\nI WOULD SAY -- CAN I GO RIGHT BACK TO THE GOOGLE?\nI'LL TAKE APPLE OVER GOOGLE. AND THE REASON I SAY THAT ONE --\nSORRY. I KNOW --\n>> YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY \"WOULD YOU RATHER.\"\n>> LOOKING AT THIS VALUATION -- MONEY, THEY'VE GOT IT.\nGROWTH, ECOSYSTEM. SO FOR ALL THOSE REASONS THAT\nNAME IS BETTER. MICROSOFT, STILL WITH NADELLA\nEARLY IN HIS TENURE, A BETTER NAME RIGHT NOW.\n>> WHAT DO YOU SAY? >> TO ME, THIS IS A TIME RISE IN\nTRADE. I ACTUALLY THINK THAT APPLE\nMAYBE HAS SOME MORE ROOM TO RUN. IF WE'RE QUESTIONING WHERE\nMICROSOFT HAS SHOWN AND PRICED INTO SATYA THAT DELL'S CLOUD.\nI THINK MICROSOFT HAS ACTUALLY GOTTEN THEMSELVES INTO A NEW\nPOSITION WHERE THEY HAVE CASH COWS AND RELEVANCY THEY DIDN'T\nHAVE. >> DAN?\n>> I PROBABLY WOULD GO WITH APPLE OVER MICROSOFT.\nAND TO ME, I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING YOU'RE SAYING.\nBUT WHEN I THINK ABOUT OFFICE 365 AND AZURE, I DON'T REALLY\nTHINK OF THESE AS THE NEXT LEG OF GROWTH.\nTO ME, ESPECIALLY WITH OFFICE 365, A REPOSITIONING OF THEIR\nEXISTING PRODUCT LINE. AZURE, SO FAR BEHIND.\n>> BUT -- >> IRRELEVANT.\n>> I KNOW IT IS, BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE\nTO COMPETE WITH AMAZON. I WOULD RATHER OWN APPLE THAN\nMICROSOFT. >> LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.\nBASICALLY, EXCEPT IN YOUR SHORT-TERM SCENARIO, EVERYBODY\nWOULD RATHER OWN THE OTHER CHOICE OVER APPLE.\n>> UH -- WELL, MAYBE NOT -- I FIND MYSELF IN THE UNUSUAL\nSITUATION OF AGREEING WITH EVERYTHING DAN JUST SAID\nREGARDING MICROSOFT VERSUS APPLE.\nBUT YEAH, GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK -- I WOULD RATHER OWN THEM AND I DO\nRATHER OWN THEM. >> YOU DO.\n>> I DO. >> I JUST THINK IF YOU -- FIRST\nOF ALL, HOW CAN WE SIT HERE AND SAY WE LOVE APPLE WHEN THREE\nWEEKS AGO, WHEN APPLE WAS TRADING AT 98, 95, 98 BUCKS, WE\nWERE, YOU KNOW, NOT ALL THAT BULLISH.\nI THINK WE WERE POINTING OUT HEADWINDS.\nI WASN'T RUNNING FOR COVER ON THE STOCK.\nI ACTUALLY FELT LIKE THERE WAS OPPORTUNITIES AND AS WE GET INTO\nTHIS REFRESH CYCLE, PLACES FOR IT TO OUTPERFORM.\nI THINK IT'S DISINGENUOUS TO SAY LET'S BUY APPLE NOW, ESPECIALLY\nAFTER IT'S GONE FROM -- TO 114. >> WE'RE GOING TO SAY -- iPHONE\n7 WAS GOING TO BE A TERRIBLE PHONE WITH NO INNOVATION, AND\nHERE WE ARE SAYING IT'S BETTER THAN EXPECTED.\n>> DAN SAID THAT. >> AND SHOWS THAT APPLE CAN, IN\nFACT, INNOVATE. >> HERE'S THE THING.\nAND I THINK THIS IS A CONSENSUS AMONG EVEN THE MOST PESSIMISTIC\nPEOPLE. WHAT THEY HAVE IN THAT PHONE IS\nOBVIOUSLY -- THE BEST SMARTPHONE ON THE MARKET RIGHT NOW.\nIT'S JUST NOT THAT EXCITING. THIS IS A COMPANY THAT'S MADE\nTHEIR BONES WITH INDUSTRIAL DESIGN.\nNOTHING HAS CHANGED, RIGHT? AND THEY'RE NOT CONVINCING US\nBASED ON A TRICKED OUT NEW CAMERA THAT THIS -- YOU HAVE TO\nGO OUT AND SPEND $750 TO UPGRADE.\nI'M TELLING YOU, WHAT HAPPENED THIS WEEK, THERE IS NO NEW NEWS.\nTHIS PHONE IS GOOD. AND PEOPLE EXPECTED IT TO BE\nGOOD. WHAT ABOUT THIS -- THE WATCH?\nTHAT WASN'T IT PARTICULARLY EN NOVATIVE, AND ANYTHING STICKILY\nINTERESTING. THE EAR BUDS, I KNOW THAT PEOPLE\nARE SAYING THIS IS -- >> IT'S NOT ABOUT THE WATCH.\nNEVER HAS BEEN. >> BUT, TIM, IT'S 70% OF THEIR\nSALES ARE COMING FROM ONE PRODUCT.\nWHICH IS WHAT HER CONCERN IS, A VALUE BUYER OF A COMPANY THAT\nTRADES, 12 TIMES EARNINGS. IT REALLY HAS TO BE ABOUT\nSOMETHING ELSE. IF YOU TALK ABOUT LAW OF LARGE\nNUMBERS -- >> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SERVICES.\n>> SERVICES. >> SERVICES.\n>> AND GROWTH. >> 19% LAST QUARTER AND 12% OF\nTHEIR OVERALL SALES. BETTER START TO HAPPEN.\nSO APPLE MUSIC HAS 17 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS.\nYOU KNOW WHAT SPOTIFY JUST ANNOUNCED TODAY?\n40 MILLION. >> HOW MANY USERS DO THEY HAVE,\nTHOUGH? >> NOT THE KEY TO THE WHOLE --\n>> THE USERS ARE THE SERVICES. >> HUGE PART OF THEIR ECOSYSTEM,\nTIM. >> APPLE PAY -- I THINK IT'S THE\nENTIRE LOYALTY OF THE BRAND THAT HOWS PEOPLE TO MONETIZE\nTHROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM. AND SO APPLE MUSIC ISN'T A\nTERRIBLY EXCITING THING, EXCEPT FOR THE FACT APPLE HAS 1 BILLION\nSUBS. >> YOU GUYS WERE FALLING OUT OF\nYOUR CHAIRS WHEN CHINA WAS GROWING -- SERVICES IN THE LAST\nQUARTER GREW 19%. >> WE'VE GOT TO GO.\n>> 19%. >> I'LL TAKE 19%.\n>> ALL RIGHT. UP NEXT --\n>> HUGE BASE. >> BAD NEWS -- CONTINUING -- I\nAM TALKING, PEOPLE! >> SORRY.\n>> BAD NEWS JUST KEEPS ON COMING FOR WELLS FARGO AND FEDERAL\nPROSECUTORS. >>> PLUS, OFFICIALLY GAME DAY\nFOR TWITTER WITH THE LAUNCH OF",

THAT'S MORE THAN A NETFLIX,\nABOUT THE SAME SIZE AS THE GM. THE QUESTION IS SIMPLE TONIGHT.\nAFTER BEING DEAD MONEY FOR A LONG TIME, IS APPLE NOW A\nMUST-OWN STOCK ONCE AGAIN?

SO IT'S MORE OF A STEEPENER\nRIGHT NOW WHAT'S BEEN DOING ON LATELY.\nTHROWING A BIT OF A FIT. IT'S LET THE LOGISTICS OF THE\nNEWLY PACKED POSITIONS ALL ON THE LONG SIDE REVERSE AND THE\nDOLLAR INDEX WENT FROM VIRTUALLY UNCHANGED TO DOWN ABOUT A SIXTH\nOF A CENT. OF COURSE HINTING BUT WE ALL\nKNOW THAT HIBTS DON'T REALLY GIVE US ANYTHING SOLID TO PUT IN\nTHE BANK. FWOOK BECKY AND THE GANG.\n>> ALL RIGHT, RICK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nAGAIN, A LOT OF DATA TO BE DIGESTING.\n>> NOTHING GOING ON. >> AS RICK POINTED OUT, MAYBE\nTHESE RETAIL SALES NUMBERS MAKE IT EVEN LESS LIKELY THAT THE FED\nRAISES RATES. I DON'T KNOW IT HAS MUCH TO\nSTRETCH INTO THIS. DO YOU TAKE AWAY THE MOST FROM\nNUMBERS THAT JUMPED OUT. >> RETAIL WEAK, BUT IT COMES OFF\nA DECENT JULY. THE NUMBERS FOR THE QUARTER ARE\nRUNNING OKAY ON MANUALIZED BASIS.\nWE WERE DOING WHAT? 4%-PLUS IN THE SECOND QUARTER.\nTHE IDEA IS WE'RE DOING BETWEEN 3% AND 4% IN THE THIRD QUARTER\nIT COMES ESSENTIALLY OFF OF LOWER GASOLINE STATION SALES I'M\nLOOKING AT. I'M LOOKING AT ALSO -- SHOULD BE\nLOWER AUTOS IN THERE. YEAH.\nMINUS 0.9%. YOU WENT UP TO 17.8 I THINK IN\nAUGUST. >> CAME BACK DOWN.\nSTILL A DECENT RATE. SO IF I WERE TRY TO ACCOUNT IT\nALREADY, RETAIL BAD, CLAIMS GOOD.\nPHILLY FED GOOD. EMPIRE STATE BAD.\nIT'S KIND OF A WASH WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT ALL.\nTHE THING THAT SPOOKED A LOT, THOUGHT THE FED MIGHT HIKE THIS\nSEPTEMBER.

YOU CAN'T REALLY TELL HERE.\nIT WAS A REALLY SHARP SLOWDOWN IN THE ECONOMY IN AUGUST.\nIF YOU LISTEN TO THE ISMs. >> ACTUALLY WENT NEGATIVE.\nFELL BELOW 50. >> IT DID.\nAND IT HAD BEEN THERE. I MEAN, IT WAS 51 TO 49.\nIT WASN'T LIKE THE END OF THE WORLD AND THERE WAS NO GREAT\nEXPECTATION THAT MANUFACTURING WAS GOING TO POWER THE ECONOMY.\nBUT WE DIDN'T WANT TO SEE IT DETRACTING FROM THE ECONOMY.\nTHAT'S THE IMPRESSION NOW. SO YOU'RE NOT GETTING MUCH IN\nTHE WAY OF DEFINITIVE REVERSAL OR ANOTHER WAY TO THINK ABOUT\nWHAT'S HAPPENING. BUT THE CLAIMS NUMBERS REMAINED\nVERY HEALTHY WHICH SUGGESTS THE JOB MARKET REMAINS HEALTHY WHICH\nSUGGESTS THE CONSUMER AND CONSUMER SPENDING SHOULD REMAIN\nHEALTHY. THERE'S NO BIG SCIENCE TO THIS\nIN TERMS OF HOW CONSUMER SPENDING -- WE TALKED ABOUT THAT\nYESTERDAY.

THIS DATA COME IN AND IT\nSUGGESTS THERE'S KIND OF MUDDLING ALONG IS WHERE IT IS.\nWHERE DO YOU SET POLICY IN THIS CONTEXT?\n>> MY INTERPRETATION IS THE U.S. ECONOMY IS IN A TRADING RANGE.\nBOUNCING AROUND. IT'S BEEN LIKE THIS FOR YEARS.\nAND THERE'S NO REALLY FUNDAMENTALLY GOOD TREND GOING\nON RIGHT NOW. AND I THINK FROM A POLICY POINT\nOF VIEW.

WE'VE BEEN DEPENDING ON THE FED.\nWE'VE BEEN HANGING ON JANET YELLEN'S EVERY WORD.\nTHAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM IN AMERICA IS WE'VE\nGOT SOME FUNDAMENTAL WEAKNESSES. WE'VE GOT SOME TAX ISSUES.\nWE'VE GOT SOME BUDGET ISSUES. WE'VE GOT INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES,\nREGULATORY ISSUES. UNTIL WE START DEALING WITH\nTHOSE, WE'RE JUST GOING TO B IN THE SAME TRADING RANGE.\n>> DO YOU BELIEVE -- MICHELLE CARUSO-CABRERA YESTERDAY, WE HAD\nAN IMPASSIONED DISCUSSION YESTERDAY.\nSAID THE FEDERAL BANKS AROUND THE WORLD ENABLE THE FISCAL SIDE\nTO NOT DO ANYTHING. DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT?\nIF THE FED WERE TO NOT -- WERE TO TIGHTEN MORE, WOULD THAT GET\nTHE FISCAL SIDE TO DO SOMETHING? >> YOU KNOW, I CAN'T -- I HAVE A\nHARD TIME PREDICTING OPTIMISTICALLY THAT ANY SIDE\nWILL GET MUCH DONE IN AMERICA RIGHT NOW.\nYOU KNOW, KIND OF GIVEN THE GRIDLOCK WE HAVE.\nTHE LACK OF THE ABILITY OF PASS LEGISLATION.\nDO YOU KNOW THE AMOUNT OF LEGISLATION ACTUALLY BEING\nPASSED NOW IS AT AN ALL-TIME LOW?\nWE'RE JUST NOT MOVING THE NEEDLE.\nBUT I THINK THE FED HAS ALLOWED US TO SKATE BY WITHOUT TACKLING\nTHINGS. >> SO THEY SHOULD DO LESS.\n>> I THINK THEY SHOULD TIGHTEN IS A HARSH WORD.\nFORCE THE ISSUE. >> TAKE YOUR QUESTION IN\nREVERSE. IT'S MORE IN REVERSE AS TO WHO\nENABLES. IN OTHER WORDS, THE FED'S BEEN\nALLOWED TO TAKE THIS POSITION. >> STEVE, THAT'S THE THOUSANDTH\nTIME SOMEONE HAS SAID THAT.

MAYBE.\nBUT THAT'S NOT GREAT. >> BUT IT'S THE TALE OF TWO\nECONOMIES. TO YOUR POINT HEALTH CARE AND\nTECHNOLOGY ARE MORE SERVICE ORIENTED AND COULD BE POISED FOR\nDECENT GROWTH. >> I THINK, YOU KNOW, A PLUNGING\nSTOCK MARKET TO 10% IS NOT AN ACHIEVEMENT.\nOKAY? >> SORRY FOR USING THE WORD\nACHIEVEMENT. >> MAYBE YOU SAY THERE'S RISK IN\nTHE SYSTEM THAT CAN GET YOU THERE.\nAN ACHIEVEMENT IS 2600. >> I GUESS IF YOU'RE SHORT THE\nMARKET, IT'S AN ACHIEVEMENT, RIGHT?\n[ OVERLAPPING SPEAKERS ] FOR CHANOS IT WOULD BE AN\nACHIEVEMENT. >> THAT'S JUST GREAT.\nTHANK YOU.

HERE YOU'RE LOOKING ALSO AGAINST\nSTABILITY, FOR EXAMPLE, THE POUND.\nTHE S & B SAYING IT REMAINED SIGNIFICANTLY OVERVALUED.\nNOW, THE LAST BATCH OF U.S. ECONOMIC DATA AUGUST RESALE\nSAILS DOWN IS SET FOR RELEASE AS FED WATCHERS WAIT TO SEE IF THIS\nLAST PUBLICATION COULD PUSH THE FED TOWARD A SEPTEMBER RATE\nHIKE. LET'S GET IN PETER ROSEN\nROSENSTREICH. >> I THINK WE'RE PROBABLY STUCK\nAT THIS FOIMT. WE'RE STUCK AT A SLIGHTLY WEAKER\nRETAIL NUMBER AFTER THE JULY NUMBER.\nI THINK THE INCOMING DATA IS PROBABLY GOING PLAY LESS OF A\nROLE THAN PERHAPS THE FEDSPEAK DID COMING IN.\nI THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE GOING TO CRUISE INTO THE MEETING.\nSNOOP WE'VE SEEN THAT YIELDING CURVE STEEPING HIGHER.\nTHAT'S BEEN SPOOKING STOCKS. WHAT DO YOU THINK?\n>> TWO THINGS. ONE, IT IS NOT THE POPPING OF\nTHE BOND BUBBLE. >> WHY NOT?\n>> FIRST OF ALL, WE DON'T THINK THE GLOBAL LOOSE MONETARY\nPOLICY, YOU KNOW, REGIME IS OVER.\nWE DON'T BELIEVE THE FED IS GOING TO RAISE RATES IN\nSEPTEMBER AND VERY UNLIKELY TO RAISE RATES IN DECEMBER AS WELL.\nNUMBER TWO, THERE'S AN ENORMOUS WALL OF MONEY OUT THERE, $10\nTRILLION ESTIMATED, YIELDING PAPER, WHICH AS SOON AS THOSE\nNUMBERS START RISING SIGNIFICANTLY, THE U.S. CURVE\nSTARTS RALLYING SIGNIFICANTLY, WE SEE THAT MONEY POUR RIGHT\nBACK INTO IT AND SUPPRESS THE YIELD RALLY.\nWE SAW THAT ON FRIDAY WHEN THE GERMAN YIELD TICKED ABOVE\nNEGATIVE LEVELS. ALL OF A SUDDEN EVERYBODY RUSHED\nFROM THE U.S. INTO GERMAN PAPER. I THINK THAT WALL OF MONEY WILL\nSUPPRESS ANY TYPE OF POPPING OF THE BUBBLE.\n>> WHAT'S A FAIR LEVEL FOR THE U.S. TENURE?\nWE WERE AT THREE-MONTH HIGHS ON THE YIELD.\n1.75. WE'RE NOW AT 1.71.\nWHERE ARE WE GOING. >> AGAIN, WE HAVE A SUBDUED OR\nDOVISH VIEW ON THE ECONOMY AND I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE EXPRESSED\nVERY CLEARLY. I DO BELIEVE 1.06, 1.65 IS A\nSAFER BET CONCERNING WHAT EVERYTHING ELSE IS DOING.\nALL OF THAT IS GOING TO KEEP A LID ON WHERE THE U.S. TENURES\nCAN GO. SO OVERALL WE THINK THE MIXED\nDATA OF THE U.S. IS REALLY NOT GOING TO PUT TOO MUCH PRESSURE\nON THE YIELD CURVE. >> YOU SAY YOU CONTINUE TO\nREHOLD ON THE SHORTS THAT YOU ALREADY HOLD.\n>> CORRECT. WE DON'T BELIEVE IN THIS SORT OF\nRALLY. WE DON'T BELIEVE IN THIS YIELD\nRALLY AS WELL. SO WE THINK THAT, YOU KNOW,\nLOOKING FOR MORE VALUE, CHASING THAT YIELD WHILE, YOU KNOW, IT\nMIGHT BE UNATTRACTIVE AND ONE THAT'S COMPLETELY OVERPLAYED AT\nTHIS POINT, IT'S STILL GOING TO BE THE BEST BET OUT THERE.\n>> WHAT ARE SOME OF THE SHORTS? >> WELL, ONE OF THE SHORTS WOULD\nPROBABLY BE THINGS LIKE THE DOLLAR, SWISS FRANC, MOVING INTO\nYEN TRADES, E.M. CURRENCIES. MEXICO, HIGH RISK.\nWE THINK THIS BLAST WE'VE SEEN RECENTLY IS NOT GOING TO HOLD UP\nAND WHEN PEOPLE START REALIZING THE FED IS NOT GOING TO DO\nANYTHING AND WE'RE IN THAT SORT OF GOLDILOCKS POSITION WHERE LOW\nINTEREST RATES, LOW GROWTH ARE GOING TO KEEP CENTRAL BANKS\nCONSERVATIVE, WE'LL SEE IT COME DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY.\n>> CAN I ASK YOU ABOUT THE SNB. IS IT FAIR TO SAY THE SNB IS\nREACTING TO THE OTHER AT THIS POINT?\n>> IT COULD BE. IF THEY WERE TRYING TO SET\nPOLICY, THEY WOULD PROBABLY GET WASHED OVER.\nSO I THINK BY STANDING ASIDE AND UNDERSTANDING THE CAPABILITIES,\nTHAT'S CRITICAL. I THINK WHAT'S ALSO NOTICEABLE\nIS THEIR COMMUNICATION STRATEGY IS VERY TIGHTER THAN WHAT WE SEE\nIN THE FEDS ESPECIALLY WHERE EVERY FED MEMBER IS COMING OUT\nAND PUSHING THEIR IDEAS AND GETTING INTERPRETED BY THE\nMARKET AND CAUSING SIGNIFICANTLY ROGUE VOLATILITY OUT OF NOWHERE\nAND EXTREMELY DISRUPTIVE. THE SNB IS MUCH MORE\nCONSERVATIVE AND HAS BEEN -- YOU KNOW, THEY HAVEN'T HAD A\nSIGNIFICANT POLICY SPEECH SINCE, I DON'T KNOW, APRIL OR MAY OF\nTHIS YEAR. SO IT ALLOWS THE MARKET TO SORT\nOF LOOK AT THE DA TARKS YOU KNOW, NOT TRY TO INTERPRET\nEVERYTHING THAT'S BEING SAID. AND I THINK IT'S A VERY GOOD WAY\nAND A GOOD MODEL FOR MANY CENTRAL BANKS MOVING FORWARD.\n>> NOW IT BRINGS ME TO THE BOJ. MAYBE THERE'S TOO MUCH TALK, TOO\nMUCH EXPECTATIONS. WE DID SEE A WEAKENING OF THE\nYEN THERE. DO YOU THINK THAT'S SUSTAIN\nSNBL. >> I THINK THEY WERE CAUGHT IN\nTHIS SORT OF COMMUNICATION TRAP, YOU KNOW, WHERE THEY'VE\nEXPRESSED WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO WITH ECONOMICS AND THEY\nSAY HOW THEY'RE GOING TO TARGET INFLATION, AND NONE OF IT'S COME\nTRUE. THE CREDIBILITY IS REALLY IN A\nROCKY PLACE, THEY'RE PROBABLY GOING TO COME OUT WITH AN\nASSESSMENT THAT SAYS WE NEED MORE TIME, MORE INFLATION MARKS.\nTHEY COULD PROBABLY TAKE A GOOD STANCE IN LEARNING WHAT THE\nSNB'S DONE. I THINK THAT'S A GOOD EXAMPLE.\nWE DON'T EXPECT SOMETHING AT NEXT WEEK'S MEETING.\nIT'S JUST GOING TO SAY THE POLICY'S NOT WORKING.\nWE'LL CONTINUE TO SEE REPETRIE YAGS.\n>> THEY CAN GET BACK BEYOND 1.05, YOU SAY?\n>> I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY CHALLENGING.\nTHE DOLLAR/YEN TRADES SIGNIFICANTLY O ON THE\nDOLLAR/YEN SPREAD AND WE'RE SEEING A PRIOR WIDENING OF THE\nFRONT END YIELDS, SO AS THAT CONTRACTS, I THINK WE'LL SEE\nCONTINUED STRENGTH IN THE YEN. I THINK IT WILL BE DIFFICULT\nWITH THE FED NOT RAISING RATES FOR THE DOLLAR/YEN TO GO ABOVE\nTHAT 1.05 LEVEL. >> PETER, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR\nYOUR TIME.

THAT'S BECAUSE OTHER CENTRAL\nBANKS ACTUALLY DOUBLED DOWN AND EASED FURTHER AS WE SAW THE\nBREXIT SITUATION UNFOLD, AS WE SAW THE CHINA SITUATION UNFOLD\nAND SO THERE SAY REAL ISSUE ON CAUSE AND EFFECT AND A VICIOUS\nCYCLE OF IF YOU PULL OUT, DO YOU HAVE THE TAIL WAGGING THE DOG?\nTHE INTEREST RATE IS TELLING THE FED WHAT TO DO.\nON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT, WE CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE A VERY\nDISORDERLY UNWINDING OF FINANCIAL MARKETS EITHER.\n>> I THINK A LOT OF THE DISCUSSION TOO COMES FROM WHAT\nHAVE BEEN THE COSTS OF HAVING THESE LOW INTEREST RATE POLICIES\nIN TERMS OF THE WAY CAPITAL HAS BEEN DIRECTED TO DIFFERENT\nTHINGS. WE TALK ABOUT THAT ALL THE TIME.\nBUT LET ME MAKE ANOTHER POINT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE\nSUPPOSED TO HAPPEN, WE SAY THE FISCAL SIDE, THE FISCAL SIDE\nISN'T JUST ABOUT SPENDING MONEY. IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT\nCHANGING YOUR -- HOLD ON ONE SECOND, DIANE, CHANGING YOUR\nECONOMY SO ACTUALLY IT WILL WORK BETTER.\nTHE THIRD ARROW IN JAPAN, NEVER HAPPENED, RIGHT?\nNEVER EASED UP ON IMMIGRATION TO IMPROVE THE EMPLOYMENT PICTURE\nTHERE. >> AND NOT GOING TO.\n>> BY THE WAY, THIS MORNING, THE GREEK LABOR MINISTER SAYS THEY\nCANNOT IMPLEMENT LABOR REFORMS WITH THE IMF'S DEMANDS.\nNOTHING HAS CHANGED SINCE 2010 BECAUSE CENTRAL BANKS GAVE THESE\nGOVERNMENTS A PASS. >> CENTRAL BANKS DID THEIR JOBS.\nI THINK THE ELECTED OFFICIALS PUNTED.\n>> JUST LIKE -- >> NOT BECAUSE --\n>> THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO. >> NO, BUT THEY -- THAT'S NOT\nTRUE. >> BACK TO THE METAPHOR OF THE\nPERSON WHO BURNED THEIR HOUSE DOWN.\nFIRE DEPARTMENT ARRIVES AND SAYS, YOU SCREWED UP, WE'RE\nGOING TO LET IT BURN. >> WE DON'T KNOW THE HOUSE ISN'T\nBURNING DOWN RIGHT NOW. YOU DON'T KNOW THAT'S WHAT'S\nHAPPENING IN EUROPE AS THEY CONTINUALLY CONTRACT.\nYOU DON'T SEE BUSINESS EXPANSION.\n>> WE DO. IF YOU LOOK AT -- MICHELLE,\nLOOK -- >> HE SAYS WE DO.\n>> WE KNOW THAT TWO THINGS HAPPENED.\nWE KNOW THAT EUROPE IMPLEMENTED WHAT IS LARGELY THOUGHT TO BE\nERRANT AND PREMATURE AUSTERITY. AND IT DID NOT WORK OUT WELL.\n>> WITHOUT REFORMS. >> WE ALSO KNOW --\n>> MICHELLE, WAIT, YOU HAD YOUR LITTLE TIME ON THE SOAP BOX, I'M\nGOING TO GET MY LITTLE TIME HERE.\nAND NUMBER TWO, IT WAS VERY, VERY LATE IN IMPLEMENTING ZERO\nRATES OR QUANTITATIVE EASING. YOU LOOK AT THE PERFORMANCE OF\nTHE UNITED STATES VERSUS EUROPE AND MEANWHILE, JAPAN HAS BEEN ON\nAGAIN, OFF AGAIN FOR MANY YEARS AND DECADES, AND ITS PERFORMANCE\nLAGGED THE U.S. THE U.S. CAME FORWARD STRONGLY.\nBECAUSE IT ACTED EARLY AND STRONGLY, ITS RESULTS SHOW IT.\n>> WE'RE STILL LAGGING BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT DONE MORE.\nAT THE END OF THE DAY, THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS DOING WHAT IT\nMANDATED TO DO. THERE IS A LAW HERE AS WELL.\nTHAT'S SOMETHING WE SORT OF LOSE SIGHT OF, THE FED IS OPERATING\nWITHIN THE LAW, THE LAW MAY BE WRONG, THERE MAY BE REFORMS.\nI HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT OPENING THAT CAN OF WORMS AND WHERE IT\nGOES ON THE FED'S INDEPENDENCE. BUT THAT SAID, RIGHT NOW,\nTHEY'RE OPERATING WITHIN THE CONSTRUCT THEY HAVE.\nBY NOT -- THEY HAVE NOT BEEN TRYING TO SIT THERE AND ABLE\nFISCAL POLICY. IF YOU LOOK AT EVERY SPEECH BACK\nTO BERNANKE, THE 2002 SPEECH, WHERE BERNANKE OUTLINED WHAT\nWOULD HAPPEN IF WE GOT TO THIS POINT, FISCAL POLICY WAS\nCRITICAL AS A PARTNER. AND IT HAS NOT BEEN THERE\nCONSISTENTLY. >> THIS IS A WHOLE OTHER\nDISCUSSION, YOU BROUGHT UP, AT THE END HERE.\n>> I KNOW. I'M MICHELLE.\n>> WE'LL DO IT ANOTHER DAY. >> I'M SORRY.\n>> IT IS AN IMPORTANT DISCUSSION TO BE HAD, RIGHT?\n>> I WOULD LOVE -- FOR ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER SEGMENT.\nI WOULD LOVE TO KNOW WHERE FED FUND RATES WOULD BE IF WE HADN'T\nHAD THE FINANCIAL -- IF WE HADN'T HAD THE CRISIS AND\nREDUCED THEM TO ZERO, GIVEN THE SAME GDP GROWTH, JOB GROWTH,\nINFLATION, WHERE WOULD WE BE? 3%?\n>> WHERE WERE THEY BEFORE? >> 4%?\n>> NOW AT .25%. >> IN 2003.\n>> YOU GET MY POINT.",

ONE INPUT THAT PREDOMINATES, I\nTHINK, FALSELY, IS THE PRICE OF OIL.\nWE'VE BEEN TRAPPED IN THIS MACROWORLD AS MEASURED BY\nCOMMODITY PRICING MEANING BIGGER FUND MANAGERS LOOK AT OIL AS A\nVIRTUAL THERMOMETER. ANY TIME THE PRICE OF OIL DROPS\nAS IT DID TODAY, PLUMMETING $1.26 DOWN TO $43.64 ANY TIME\nOILS RALLY, THAT'S A SIGN DEMAND IS PICKING UP.\nI MEAN RIDICULOUS. THIS IS RIDICULOUS.\nTHE PRICE OF CRUDE IS THE SUM OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND, OKAY?\nWITH SUPPLY READY TO OVERWHELM ANY DEMAND, EVEN DEMAND THAT'S\n10, 15, 20% STRONGER THAN IT IS NOW.\nWHEN U.S. OIL INVENTORIES DROP AS THEY DID TODAY, YOU HAVE A\nFLEETING RALLY IN CRUDE AND THEN A DECLINE BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE\nTHAT THERE'S STILL A GLUT. TOO MUCH OIL BEING PRODUCED.\nLATER AS OIL HEADS TO $40 FROM $43, YOU THEN GET A REBOUND\nBECAUSE THE COUNTRIES THAT WANT THE PRICE HIGHER SPREAD RUMORS\nOF AN EMERGENCY OPEC MEETING TO FREEZE PRODUCTION.\nTHIS RUMOR MONGERING WORKS LIKE A CHARM EVERY TIME.\nIN OTHER WORDS, THE PRICE OF OIL, IT'S MANIPULATED.\nIT'S BOGUS. AND IT HAS LITTLE TO NOTHING TO\nDO WITH THE REAL DEMAND WE NEED TO CALCULATE TO MAKE OUR WORLD\nVIEW, EVEN AS IT'S THE METRIC OF CHOICE FOR SO MANY FUND\nMANAGERS. OTHERS USE THE PRICE OF METALS\nLIKE COPPER AND STEEL. ONE OF THE REASONS IS COPPER HAS\nBEEN DISPLACED BY OTHER MATERIALS.\nIT'S AN INDICATOR OF NOTHING. SO WHAT AM I LOOKING AT?\nIN THE U.S. FIRST IT'S EMPLOYMENT.\nI'M STILL ENCOURAGED. I THINK EMPLOYMENT IS RELATIVELY\nSTRONG. IT'S WHY I DON'T FEAR A RATE\nHIKE AS MUCH AS OTHERS. THAT'S BASED ON MY FORECAST BAY\nLOOKING BACK AT WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE FED TIGHTENED IN\nSEPTEMBER. NEXT I LOOK AT HOUSING.\nHOUSING DEMAND REMAINS STRONG IN THIS COUNTRY.\nWE'RE TALKING TO TOLL BROTHERS LATER TONIGHT AND THEIR VIEW IS\nPRETTY POSITIVE ON THAT LATEST CONFERENCE CALL.\nWHEN HOUSING IS ROBUST, THAT MEANS SPENDING TO FIX UP A HOUSE\nIS STRONG, AND THAT'S A MAJOR PIECE OF OUR HUGE RETAIL\nECONOMY. HOW ABOUT NON-REALLY\nCONSTRUCTION? BIG CHUNK.\nBIG CHUNK OF THE BUSINESS. I SPEAK TO SEVERAL COMPANIES IN\nEVERY SILO OF NON-REALLY FROM THE CONSTRUCTION LOANS IN ALL\nGEOGRAPHIES TO THE MATERIALS NEEDED TO ERECT BUILDINGS TO THE\nFIXTURES, HEATING, AIR-CONDITIONING, LIGHTING,\nVENTILATION COMPANIES. MY JUDGMENT?\nTHINGS ARE PRETTY GOOD. WHILE I DON'T LIKE THE\nAUTOMOBILE STOCKS BECAUSE THE WORLDWIDE ENTERPRISE ISN'T AS\nHEALTHY AS I'D LIKE AS I JUST SAID, THE DEMAND IN THE U.S. IS\nSTRONG WITH SUVs AND TRUCKS SELLING VERY WELL.\nAEROSPACE, STRONG OUT OF BOEING TODAY.\nAT THE ACTUAL STORE LEVEL, IT IS MIXED, NOT TERRIBLE.\nCASUAL DINING IS NOT GOOD. LOOK AT CRACKER BARREL DOWN $10\nTODAY. BUT SOME OF THAT IS BECAUSE IT'S\nJUST A LOT CHEAPER TO STAY HOME THANKS TO THE DECLINE IN THE\nPRICE OF FOOD MENTIONED ON THE CRACKER BARREL CALL.\nI BELIEVE THERE'S ALSO BEEN A TAMPING OF DEMAND FROM INCREASED\nHEALTH CARE BILLS. RETAILERS, HIT OR MISS.\nWE SEE STRENGTH OF WALMART AND AMAZON WHICH ARE A HUGE PART OF\nTHE RETAIL EQUATION. DEPARTMENT STORES, NOT GREAT ALL\nWE WE HAD A KEY UP GRADE AT MACY'S TODAY.\nBACK TO SCHOOL, NOT BAD AT ALL. GO --\nAND THEN THERE'S PERHAPS THE MOST OVERLOOKED GAUGE OF DEMAND\nIN THIS COUNTRY, AND THAT'S THE HUGE AND, YES, ENTIRELY\nUNEXPECTED INCREASE IN ORDERS FOR APPLE'S SUPPOSEDLY BLAH\niPHONE 7. WHEN YOU HAVE SPRINT AND\nT-MOBILE SAYING THEY HAVE OFF THE CHART DEMANDS FOR THE PHONE,\nWHEN AT&T TELLS US TODAY THAT DEMAND IS BETTER THAN EXPECTED\nAND VERIZON SAYS IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE PREDICTIONS CEO LOWELL\nMcADAM MADE ON THIS SHOW, THAT THE iPHONE IS INDEED SELLING\nVERY WELL, THEN IT'S AN ACTUAL NEEDLE MOVER.\nHENCE THE TERRIFIC RUN IN APPLE STOCK.\nTHE SESSION'S LEADER. WE KNOW THAT MILLENNIALS NOW\nREPRESENT ABOUT HALF THE CONSUMER DEMAND IN THIS COUNTRY\nAND THEY SPEND ON WAY DIFFERENT THINGS THAN OTHER GENERATIONS\nINCLUDING MY OWN. THEY LIKE EXPERIENCES.\nTHEY LIKE GAMES. WHAT CAN YOU PLAY THE MOST\nHIGH-POWERED GAMES ON? THE iPHONE 7.\nHOW DO YOU SHARE YOUR EXPENSES BEST?\nWITH BEAUTIFUL PICTURES TAKEN ON YOUR BRAND-NEW iPHONE.\nYOU HAVE A BILLION iPHONE USERS AND THEY'RE WILLING TO SPEND\nHUNDREDS OF DOLLARS ON THEIR PHONES, THESE NEW ONES THAT THEY\nOTHERWISE WOULD SPEND ON SOMETHING ELSE BECAUSE THEY WANT\nTHE PROCESSING POWER.

              "text": "SHIP ONCOLOGY DRUG FAILED TO\nMEET ITS PRIMARY END POINT IN A CLINICAL TRIAL FOR ADVANCED\nNON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER, AND THAT IS A GIGANTIC END MARK.\nSO THIS NEWS WAS A HUGE SET BACK FOR THE COMPANY'S MOST IMPORTANT\nDRUG. IT PARTICULARLY LED TO A SLEW OF\nANALYSTS DOWN GRADES. BUT BRISTOL-MYERS IS A MASSIVE\nDRUG COMPANY WITH LOTS OF PRODUCTS IN THE PIPE.\nSO THEN WHY DID THIS ONE BUSTED TRIAL DO SO MUCH DAMAGE?\nUNTIL WE GOT THIS SUB PAR DATA, BRISTOL-MYERS WAS WIDELY\nREGARDED IN THE CANCER IMMUNOTHERAPY SPACE.\nOPP TEVA IS ALREADY COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE AND AND OPP DIVA'S\nGROWTH HAS BEEN EXPLOSIVE. LAST YEAR IN GENERATED A BILLION\nDOLLARS IN SALES AND IT'S JUST THE -- AS SOON AS WE LEARNED\nTHIS DRUG FAILED TO MEET ITS PRIMARY END POINTS IN THAT LUNG\nCANCER TRIAL, WALL STREET SUDDENLY SOURED ON THE ENTIRE\nFRANCHISE, ASSUMING PEOPLE WOULD SWITCH TO A COMPETITOR, AND\nTHAT'S THE DRUG KEYTRUDA THAT MERCK MAKES.\nHOWEVER, THE REALITY IS FAR MU NUANCED.\nTHE REASON THIS DRUG FAILED TO HIT ITS END POINTS IS BECAUSE\nBRISZ TOLL MEYERS SENT THE BAR TO HIGH WHEN THEY SET THE\nCLINICAL TRIAL. OPP TEVA OPERATES ON A\nPARTICULAR PROTEIN BUT WHEN THEY SET UP THE STUDY, THEY INCLUDED\nANY PATIENTS WHO EXPRESSED THAT -- BRIGS TOLL MEYERS WANTED\nTO SHOW THAT OPP TEVA WOULD BE EFFECTIVE FOR EVERY LUNG CANCER\nPATIENT, BUT EVEN IF THEY SET THE THRESHOLD AT 50%, IT WOULD\nHAVE DEMONSTRATED THE DRUG COULD BE EFFECTIVE FOR A HUGE NUMBER\nOF PATIENTS. BECAUSE THEY SET THEIR SIGHTS SO\nHIGH, THEY GOT BURNED. SO THEN WHY CIRCLE BACK TO\nBRISTOL-MYERS NOW? I MEAN ISN'T IT JUST LEFT FOR\nDEAD? REMEMBER, THE STOCK LOST\n$20 BILLION OF VALUE THE FIRST DAY AFTER THE NEWS BROKE AND\nSINCE THEN IT'S ONLY GONE LOWER. WE'RE ONLY TALKING ABOUT A\n$5 BILLION STROKE, RIGHT? $5 BILLION IN LOST SALES.\nBIG, BUT NOT $20 BILLION IN MARKET CUT BIG.\nAT THE MOST BASIC LEVEL WE'VE BEEN BUYING BRISTOL-MYERS\nBECAUSE THE PENDULUM HAS SWUNG FROM OPDIVO ESTIMATES BEING TOO\nHIGH TO THEM NOW BEING TOO LOW. NOW THAT ANALYSTS HAVE\nCOMPLETELY STRIPPED 9 NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER NUMBERS FROM\nTHEIR FORECAST, IT'S JUST WAY TOO MUCH NEGATIVITY BAKED IN.\nAS THE COMPANY POINTED OUT, THEY'VE STILL GOT A NON-SMALL\nCELL LUNG CANCER TRIAL GOING PAIRING OPDIVO WITH ANOTHER ONE\nOF THEIR DRUGS. IF THAT TRIAL GOES WELL, THE\nESTIMATES WILL NEED TO GO HIGHERMENT REMEMBER, EVEN WITH\nLAST MONTH'S SETBACK, OPDIVO ALREADY HAS FDA APPROVAL FOR A\nHOST OF DIFFERENT CANCERS. I DON'T THINK THE STRENGTH OF\nTHIS DRUG WILL BE TOTALLY DIMINISHED JUST BECAUSE IT DID\nPOORLY IN A SINGLE POORLY DESIGNED BY THE COMPANY STUDY.\nTHE FACT IS BRISTOL-MYERS REMAINS A MAJOR PLAYER IN THE\nHOTTEST SUBSET OF ONCOLOGY, WHICH IS THE CANCER\nIMMUNOTHERAPY MARKET. THIS IS A CLASSIC BIG PHARMA\nCOMPANY WITH A HOST OF DIFFERENT DRUGS FOR A VARIETY OF DISEASES\nFROM CANCER TO IMMUNE CONDITIONS TO CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES AND\nNUROLOGIST AND THEY'VE GOT A ROBUST NEW PIPELINE EVEN AFTER\nTAKING THE OPDIVO CUTS INTO ACCOUNT.\nTHE STOCK YIELDS 2.75% AND EVEN IF THE FED TIGHTENS NEXT WEEK,\nTHAT'S LIKELY TO BE BETTER THAN YOU'D GET FROM THE TEN YEAR\nTREASURY. I THINK BRISTOL-MYERS REPRESENTS\nTREMENDOUS VALUE AT THESE LEVELS.\nONE BIG CAVEAT. BRISTOL-MYERS IS NOW A VALUE\nINVESTMENT AND THAT REQUIRES A LONG-TERM TIME HORIZON.\nIT COULD TAKE A YEAR, TWO YEARS FOR THE STORY TO PLAY OUT.\nSHORT TERM THINGS COULD REMAIN CHOPPY AND THERE'S NO REASON IT\nK7B9 GO STILL LOWER. I LIKE IT INTO ANY ADDITIONAL\nWEAKNESS. AS WE TOLD SUBSCRIBERS, WE'LL\nPATIENTLY BUY MORE BRISTOL-MYERS ON THE WAY DOWN.\nSO HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE. IN THIS NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR\nTHE DRUG INDUSTRY, I THINK BRISTOL-MYERS HAS FINALLY COME\nDOWN TO THE POINT WHERE IT'S SIMPLY TOO AFRACKTIVE TO IGNORE\nAS A LONG-TERM INVESTMENT. SURE, IT'S NOT FLYING HIGH RIGHT\nNOW. BUT BRISTOL STOCK HAS BEEN\nHAMMERED BEFORE, AND IT'S ALWAYS >>> BOY, IT IS TOUGH TO OWN A\nRETAIL STOCK THESE DAYS. >> THE HOUSE OF PAIN.\n>> LATELY IT FEELS LIKE THE WHOLE GROUP HAS FALLEN OUT OF\nFAVOR IN THE WALL STREET FASHION SHOW, WHICH HAS A WHOLE\nDIFFERENT AESTHETIC FROM FASHION WEEK.\nHERE'S THE THING. THE CONSUMER DISCREASARY\nCATEGORY MAKES UP A LITTLE OVER 12% OF THE S&P 500.\nMOST OF THAT BEING RETAIL. WHY DOES THAT MATTER TO YOU?\nBECAUSE THERE ARE TONS OF HEDGE FUNDS AND MUTUAL FUNDS OUT THERE\nTHAT DON'T FEEL SAFE UNLESS THEY'RE MIRRORING THE SECTOR\nRATING OF THE S&P 500. BASICALLY THEY OPERATE LIKE AN\nINDEX PHONE WITH A BRAIN. THAT WAY YOU'RE MUCH LESS LIKELY\nTO -- >> IN SHORT THANKS TO WHAT I\nCALL THE MECHANICS OF MONEY MANAGEMENT, MANY OF THESE FUNDS\nHAVE A LOT OF CASH THAT THEY NEED TO INVEST IN SOME SORT OF\nRETAILER. IN ONLY THEY COULD CONTINUE TO\nMIRRORING THE SECTOR MAKEUP OF THE S&P 500.\nTHIS MAY SOUND LIKE A CRAZY WAY TO INVEST, BUT IT'S HOW A LOT OF\nTHESE GUYS OPERATE. JUST LOOK AT THE HEALTH CARE\nSECTOR. THE BROADER SEC TORE HAS BEEN A\nDOG ALL YEAR, RIGHT? BUT THE MEDICAL DEVICE STOCKS\nHAVE ROARED HIGHER BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONE SEGMENT OF THE\nHEALTH CARE COHORT THAT'S ACTUALLY DOING WELL AND IS NOT\nIN THE CROSSHAIRS OF THE POLITICIANS.\nSO ALL THE HEDGE FUNDS AND MUTUAL FUNDS WHO NEED HEALTH\nCARE EXPOSURE PUL INTO THE MEDICAL DEVICE STOCKS LIKE\nBOSTON SCIENTIFIC, WHOSE CEO WE HEARD FROM JUST LAST NIGHT.\nMORE ON THAT LATER. RIGHT NOW, THOUGH, IT'S RETAIL\nTHAT'S IN THE DOG HOUSE. BUT WE KNOW THAT BASKETS OF\nMONEY ALLOCATED FOR RETAIL STOCKS NEED TO GO SOMEWHERE.\nTHEY NEED A NAME IS WHAT WE WOULD SAY ON THE DESK, WHICH\nBRINGS ME TO FOOT LOCKER. YES, FOOT LOCKER, THE HUGE\nATHLETIC APPAREL CHAIN. EVEN THOUGH IT'S PULLED BACK A\nFEW BUCKS IN RECENT WEEKS, I THINK FOOTLOCKER IS EXACTLY THE\nKIND OF RETAILER THAT THE BIG BOYS WILL FEEL COMFORTABLE\nBUYING IN ORDER TO GET THE RETAIL EXPOSURE THAT THEY NEED\nTO HAVE. WHAT MAKES ME SAY THIS?\nOKAY. THE LAST TIME I TALKED TO YOU\nABOUT FOOT LOCKER WAS IN EARLY JUNE WHEN THE COMPANY HAD JUST\nSTUMBLED. AFTER A TWO YEAR WINNING STREAK\nWHERE THEY ONLY DELIVERED KNOCKOUT NUMBERS.\nTHE STOCK HAD GOTTEN SLAMMED AND INVESTORS WERE WRITING THIS ONE\nOFF. THEY DECIDED TO FORGET ABOUT\nFOOT LOCKER. STILL ONE MORE VICTIM, OF\nCOURSE, OF THE DEATH OF THE SHOPPING MALL.\nBUT I TOLD YOU NOT TO BE DISHEARTENED BY ONE MISSED\nQUARTER. IN PART THAT'S BECAUSE THERE\nWERE MITD GATING CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE THE LIQUIDATION OF SPORTS\nAUTHORITY, A MAJOR COMPETITOR THAT AT THE TIME WAS FURIOUSLY\nDUMPING ITS MERCHANDISE AT FIRE SALE PRICES BEFORE CLOSING ALL\nOF ITS STORES. I ALSO WOINTED OUT THAT ONCE\nSPORTS AUTHORITY HAD FINISHED LIQUID ATDING, THEIR MARKET\nSHARE WOULD BE UP FOR GRABS AND BEYOND THAT FOOT LOCKER HAD A\nLOT GOING FOR IT, INCLUDING A MIDGE STORE INNOVATION PLAN.\nBEST OF ALL, I LIKED THAT THE STOCK WAS DIRT CHEAP, TRADING AT\nMERELY 10.7 TIMES NEXT YEAR'S EARNING ESTIMATES.\nSOLID EXECUTION. THAT'S WHY I SAID FOOT LOCKER\nLOOKED LIKE A STEAL BACK AT THE BEGINNING OF JUNE WHEN IT WAS AT\n$55. SURE ENOUGH, IT DIDN'T TAKE VERY\nLONG FOR FOOT LOCKER TO COME",

HILLARY CLINTON IS GOING TO\nLEAVE HER HOME IN CHAPPAQUA TODAY IN JUST A COUPLE HOURS OR\nSO, AND RETURN TO THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AS YOU SAID.\nYOU CAN SEE HER AIRPLANE IS HERE BEHIND ME HERE ON THE TARMAC.\nSHE'S EAGER TO GET BACK TO CAMPAIGNING, OF COURSE, BECAUSE\nTHE CAMPAIGN AND THE RACE FRANKLY HAS TIGHTENED SINCE SHE\nLEFT CAMPAIGNING. IT'S BEEN A WEEK SINCE SHE'S\nBEEN IN A BATTLEGROUND STATE. WE KNOW HER DIAGNOSIS ON\nPNEUMONIA CAME LAST FRIDAY AND THEN SHE REVEALED IT ON SUNDAY.\nBUT REALLY, THEY ARE TRYING TO GET BEYOND THIS AND GET BACK TO\nCAMPAIGNING. SO MUCH TALK ABOUT MEDICINE THIS\nMORNING. SO MUCH TALK ABOUT MEDICAL\nRECORDS AND DISCLOSURE. SECRETARY CLINTON WAS ON THE TOM\nJOINER RADIO PROGRAM THAT AIRED THIS MORNING IN AN INTERVIEW\nWITH CNN'S DON LEMON. SHE'S TRYING TO MOVE BEYOND THE\nMEDICAL RECORDS TO TRANSPARENCY OF A DIFFERENT KIND WITH TAX\nRETURNS. LET'S LISTEN.\n>> I THINK I HAVE WORKED VERY, VERY HARD TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT\nTHAN NOT JUST MY OPPONENT, BUT REALLY IN A COMPARISON TO\nANYBODY WHO HAS RUN. THE MEDICAL INFORMATION I HAVE\nPUT OUT AND WE ARE GOING TO PUT OUT MORE, MEETS AND EXCEEDS THE\nSTANDARD THAT OTHER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES, INCLUDING PRESIDENT\nOBAMA AND MITT ROMNEY AND OTHERS HAVE MET.\nMY TAX RETURNS ARE OUT THERE, 40 YEARS OF TRANSPARENCY ABOUT MY\nTAX RETURNS. SO I THINK THAT THE REAL\nQUESTIONS NEED TO BE DIRECTED TOWARD DONALD TRUMP AND HIS\nFAILURE TO EVEN MEET THE MOST MINIMALISTIC STANDARDS THAT WE\nEXPECT OF SOMEONE BEING THE NOMINEE OF ONE OF OUR TWO MAJOR\nPARTIES. >> WE HAVE HEARD THIS FIGHT BACK\nAND FORTH. AS YOU KNOW, OVER THE LAST\nSEVERAL DAYS, AS WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WHO IS MORE\nTRANSPARENT. DR. GUPTA IS RIGHT IN THE SENSE\nTHAT SHE HAS RELEASED MORE MEDICAL INFORMATION AND\nCERTAINLY MORE TAX INFORMATION. I'M TOLD BY HER ADVISERS SHE'S\nNOT GOING TO GET THIS A TIT FOR TAT WITH DONALD TRUMP OVER WHO\nHAS RELEASED MORE INFORMATION BUT THEY DO PLAN TO PUSH THE TAX\nRETURNS AS A WAY OF DISCLOSURE HERE.\nQUITE FRANKLY, CAROL, THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN KNOWS IT HAS\nSOME GROUND TO MAKE UP AFTER SHE'S BEEN OFF THE ROAD FOR A\nCOUPLE DAYS. SO SHE WILL BE GOING TO\nGREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA, AND ON TO WASHINGTON, D.C. FOR A\nSPEECH TONIGHT. BUT THAT FIRST DEBATE, SOME 11\nDAYS AWAY, THE TOP PRIORITY FOR THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN, I'M TOLD,\nIS TO KEEP THEIR CANDIDATE HEALTHY FOR THAT FIRST DEBATE.\n>> JEFF ZELENY FROM WHITE PLAINS, NEW YORK.\nTHANK YOU. LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT ANGLE.\nWITH ME, CNN POLITICS EXECUTIVE EDITOR MARK PRESTON, COLUMNIST\nFOR THE DAILY BEAST, PATRICIA MURPHY AND CHRISTOPHER ROWLAND\nFROM THE BOSTON GLOBE. WELCOME TO ALL OF YOU.\nLET'S TALK ABOUT TAX RETURNS, BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP JR. TOLD\nTHE \"TRIBUNE REVIEW\" IN PENNSYLVANIA SOMETHING VERY\nINTERESTING ABOUT WHY DONALD TRUMP WILL NOT RELEASE HIS TAX\nRETURNS. HE SAID THAT DONALD TRUMP\nDOESN'T WANT TO RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS BECAUSE THEY ARE 12,000\nPAGES AND THEY WOULD MAKE FINANCIAL AUDITORS OUT OF EVERY\nPERSON IN THE COUNTRY AND DONALD TRUMP JR. SAYS THAT WOULD ONLY\nDETRACT FROM HIS DAD'S MESSAGE. THOUGHTS, CHRISTOPHER?\n>> WELL, I MEAN, I THINK THE FINANCIAL PRESS AND THE AMERICAN\nMEDIA AND THE PUBLIC IS PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF WEEDING\nTHROUGH THE 12,000 PAGES AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE BOTTOM\nLINE IS ON DONALD TRUMP'S TAXES. IT'S CLEAR THAT HE PROBABLY PAYS\nA VERY LOW LEVEL AND I THINK THAT THAT'S BEEN WIDELY REPORTED\nBASED ON HIS REAL ESTATE DEALINGS AND HILLARY CLINTON\nWINS ON TRANSPARENCY WHEN IT COMES TO TAXES.\nSHE HAS RELEASED ALL HER TAXES AND HE HAS NOT.\nSO IT'S CLEAR WHY THIS MORNING SHE WANTS TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT\nFROM HEALTH RECORDS TO TAX RECORDS, BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE\nS SHE DOES HAVE MORE TRANSPARENCY\nTHAN THE CANDIDATE WHO HAS PROBLEMS WITH TRANSPARENCY.\n>> GOING BACK TO THIS STATEMENT FROM DONALD TRUMP JR. BECAUSE\nI'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HE MEANS BY THIS, DOES HE MEAN\nVOTERS COULDN'T LOOK AT HIS TAXES AND WHY RELEASE ANYTHING\nSO WHY RELEASE THEM ANYWAY? >> FIRST, IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE\nTHIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE HEARD ANYBODY FROM THE TRUMP\nCAMP SAY THIS. I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY WHY HE\nHASN'T RELEASED HIS TAX RETURNS. THEY HAVE BEEN SAYING HE'S NOT\nRELEASING HIS TAX RETURNS BECAUSE HE'S UNDER A ROUTINE\nAUDIT. THERE'S NO REASON NOT TO RELEASE\nYOUR TAX RETURNS, THERE'S NOTHING THAT THE IRS IS TELLING\nHIM THAT YOU CAN'T RELEASE IT BECAUSE IT'S UNDER AUDIT.\nI THINK THIS IS THE REAL REASON AND IT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT\nPEOPLE GOING THROUGH HIS TAX RETURNS.\nBUT THAT IS HOW TRANSPARENCY WORKS.\nHE'S SAYING WE DON'T WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO GO THROUGH\nAND START TO PICK APART OUR TAX RETURNS.\nTHEY'RE NOT GOING TO UNDERSTAND THE TAX LAW.\nAGAIN, THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS TO BE OPEN AND TO DISCLOSE THE\nINFORMATION THAT'S PERTINENT TO THIS CAMPAIGN.\nWITHIN -- FIRST OF ALL, NOBODY IS GOING TO GO THROUGH, MOST\nPEOPLE ARE NOT GOING THROUGH 12,000 PAGES BUT THEY CAN SEE\nTHE RELEVANT INFORMATION. THEY CAN SEE TO WHOM AND HOW\nMUCH HE HAS GIVEN TO CHART. THEY CAN CERTAINLY SEE HIS TAX\nRATE. THEY CAN SEE WHO HE'S DOING\nBUSINESS WITH. IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT\nINFORMATION AND I THINK TO WRITE IT OFF AND JUST SAY OH, THOSE\nARE JUST MY TAX RETURNS, REALLY IT'S A WINDOW INTO HIS ENTIRE\nFINANCIAL SITUATION RIGHT NOW THAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT.\n>> THE OTHER THOUGHT I HAD IS I KNOW OUR TAXES MIGHT NOT BE AS\nCOMPLICATED AS DONALD TRUMP'S BUT EVERY AMERICAN DOES TAXES\nAND THERE ARE A GOOD NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO SPEND A LOT OF TIME\nDOING THEIR TAXES AND THEY MAKE SURE THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT\nTHEY'RE DOING BECAUSE AFTER ALL, IT'S THEIR MONEY.\n>> YEAH. LOOK, WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO ON\nTHIS IS THAT I DON'T THINK DONALD TRUMP EVER PLANNED ON\nRELEASING HIS TAXES. WHILE HE SAID THAT HE IS UNDER\nAUDIT, I GUESS WE WILL TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD, HE COULD RELEASE\nHIS TAXES. WE UNDERSTAND THAT.\nWE KNOW THAT. CLEARLY HE WANTS TO KEEP HIS BUSINESS PRIVATE,\nHIS BUSINESS DEALINGS PRIVATE. TO THE POINT OF WHAT WE HEARD\nHIS SON SAY TODAY, THAT'S PROBABLY THE MOST HONEST ANSWER\nWE HAVE GOTTEN SO FAR. BOTTOM LINE, THEY DON'T WANT THE\nCAMPAIGN TO BE DISTRACTED FROM THE WAY THAT DONALD TRUMP IS\nTRYING TO WIN THIS ELECTION. AND IF HE PUTS OUT THOSE 12,000\nPAGES OF TAX RETURNS, THEN QUITE FRANKLY, THERE'S NO DOUBT THEY\nWILL GIVE POLITICAL AMMUNITION TO THE HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN\nFOR SOMETHING. THEY WILL BE ABLE TO EXTRACT\nSOMETHING OUT OF THAT. THAT'S WHY WE HAVEN'T SEEN THEM\nAND WILL LIKELY NOT SEE THEM. >> I HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE.\nTHANKS TO ALL OF YOU. >>> HANDING OUT SUPPLIES TO\nFLOOD VICTIMS, CROSSING THE",

SHE WILL BE 69 NEXT MONTH.\nTO, \"A,\" HAVE THEM, YOU KNOW, THIS OLD BUT ALSO HAVE LESS\nINFORMATION ABOUT THEM THAN EVER BEFORE.\nBUT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS TRYING TO MAKE A DISTINCTION\nHERE. THEY SAY THAT THEY HAVE RELEASED\n24 MORE POINTS OF INFORMATION THAN DONALD TRUMP HAS ON THE\nMEDICATION SHE'S TAKING AND OTHER THINGS HERE.\nSO, THE -- YOU KNOW THIS TALK OF MEDICINE IS GOING TO DOMINATE\nTHE CAMPAIGN DISCUSSION AT LEAST FOR THIS MORNING BUT THE\nCLINTONS ALSO WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT THEY'VE RELEASED TAX\nRETURNS, DONALD TRUMP HAS NOT YET DONE THAT, CAROL, SO ANOTHER\nDAY NOT TALKING ABOUT ISSUES HERE ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\nCAROL? >> JEFF ZELENY REPORTING LIVE\nFROM CHAPPAQUA, NEW YORK THIS MORNING.\nDON LEMON JOINED THE TOM JOYNER RADIO SHOW THIS MORNING AND\nASKED HILLARY CLINTON A FEW QUESTIONS.\nHE ASKED HER ABOUT COLIN POWELL'S LEAKED E-MAILS, ABOUT\nHUBRIS AND AIR GONS. >> I HAVE TO ASK YOU ABOUT\nSOMETHING THAT'S NEW IN THE NEWS.\nTHE FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE COLIN POWELL IN HIS HACKED\nE-MAILS HAS CRITICIZED YOU AND YOUR QUOTE, THIS IS HIS SAYING,\nMINIONS, FOR TRYING TO DRAG HIM INTO YOUR E-MAIL SERVER PROBLEM.\nHE CONCLUDES BY SAYING QUOTE EVERYTHING HRC TOUCHES, SHE KIND\nOF SCREWS UP WITH HUBRIS AND THAT'S THE END OF THE QUOTE.\nHOW DO YOU ANSWER HIM, AND CRITICS, WHO SAY WHETHER IT'S\nYOUR E-MAILS OR DISCLOSING YOUR HEALTH ISSUES OR EVEN POINTING\nOUT TRUMP'S FLYPAPER-LIKE ABILITY TO ATTRACT RACIALLY\nINSENSITIVE OR DEPLORABLES AS YOU CALL THEM, SOMEHOW THE\nMESSAGE GETS SCREWED UP? >> YOU KNOW I HAVE A GREAT DEAL\nOF RESPECT FOR COLIN POWELL. AND I HAVE A LOT OF SYMPATHY FOR\nANYONE WHOSE E-MAILS BECOME PUBLIC.\nI'M NOT GOING TO START DISCUSSING SOMEONE ELSE'S\nPRIVATE E-MAILS. I'VE ALREADY SPENT A LOT OF TIME\nTALKING ABOUT MY OWN, AS YOU KNOW.\nWHAT I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT ABOUT NIECE E-MAILS, IS THE\nCHILLING FACT THAT THE RUSSIANS ARE CONTINUING TO ATTEMPT TO\nINTERFERE IN OUR ELECTION. AND, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO SAY,\nI'M INCREASINGLY CONCERNED BY HOW WE'VE SEEN DONALD TRUMP'S\nALARMING CLOSENESS WITH THE KREMLIN BECOME MORE AND MORE\nCLEAR OVER THE COURSE OF THIS CAMPAIGN.\nIT'S DEEPLY CONCERNING, AND THERE'S A LOT THAT TRUMP SHOULD\nANSWER FOR. BECAUSE THESE ATTEMPTS BY RUSSIA\nTO INTERFERE IN THE ELECTION, ARE ONES THAT GO RIGHT HAND IN\nHAND WITH HIS CLOSENESS TO THE KREMLIN, HIS FLATTERY OF PUTIN,\nAND IT'S NOT JUST ME THAT IS NOTICING THIS, IT'S FELLOW\nREPUBLICANS OF FOREIGN POLICY AND NATIONAL SECURITY\nEXPERIENCE, NATO LEADERS, SO I'M GOING TO KEEP, YOU KNOW, RAISING\nTHE ALARGE ABOUT RUSSIAN INFLUENCE AND THAT, OF COURSE,\nRAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT WHO TRUMP ACTUALLY DOES BUSINESS WITH.\n>> CAN I -- CAN I JUST FOLLOW AND SAY THAT BY HUBRIS HE'S\nSAYING THAT YOU'RE -- YOU'RE STEPPING ON YOUR MESSAGE.\nHE'S INSINUATING THAT YOU STEP ON YOUR MESSAGE THROUGH HUBRIS\nOR ARROGANCE OR NOT BEING TRANSPARENT.\nHOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT SPECIFICALLY?\n>> AGAIN, I'M NOT -- YOU KNOW, I'M NOT GOING TO COMMENT ON\nANYTHING THAT IS SAID IN A PRIVATE E-MAIL.\n>> AND EVEN TO CRITICS BEYOND THE FORMER SECRETARY?\n>> WELL BUT I THINK I'VE WORKED VERY, VERY HARD TO BE MORE\nTRANSPARENT THAN NOT JUST MY OPPONENT, BUT REALLY IN A\nCOMPARISON TO ANYBODY WHO'S RUN, YOU KNOW, THE MEDICAL\nINFORMATION I'VE PUT OUT. AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT OUT MORE.\nMEETS AND EXCEEDS THE STANDARDS THAT OTHER PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATES, INCLUDING PRESIDENT OBAMA AND YOU KNOW MITT ROMNEY\nAND OTHERS HAVE MET. MY TAX RETURNS ARE OUT THERE, 40\nYEARS OF TRANSPARENCY ABOUT MY TAX RETURNS.\nSO I THINK THAT THE REAL QUESTIONS NEED TO BE DIRECTED\nTOWARD DONALD TRUMP, AND HIS FAILURE TO EVEN MEET THE MOST\nMINIMALISTIC STANDARDS THAT WE EXPECT OF SOMEONE BEING THE\nNOMINEE OF ONE OF OUR TWO MAJOR PARTIES.\n>> DO YOU KNOW WHEN YOUR MEDICAL RECORDS ARE GOING TO -- THE REST\nTHAT YOU SAID YOU'LL RELEASE BECAUSE HE SAYS HE'S RELEASING\nSOME SOON. DO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO\nRELEASE THE REST OF YOURS OR MORE INFORMATION?\n>> MORE INFORMATION I THINK WILL BE VERY SHORTLY.\nBECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE REALLY WANT TO RESPOND TO LEGITIMATE\nQUESTIONS THAT PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE.\nI'M VERY TOUCHED BY THE CONCERN THAT'S BEEN SET FORTH ABOUT MY\nHEALTH. I'M REALLY GLAD THAT I DID\nFINALLY FOLLOW MY DOCTOR'S ORDERS AND TAKE SOME DAYS TO\nREST. INSTEAD OF JUST TRYING TO KEEP\nPOWERING THROUGH. WHICH I THINK IS COMMON\nEXPERIENCE FOR PEOPLE. SO WE'RE GOING TO PUT OUT MORE\nINFORMATION, AND THAT WILL BE THEN, TWICE AS MUCH AS HE PUT\nOUT. AND WE'LL SEE WHAT, IF ANYTHING,\nHE'S WILLING TO DISCLOSE. >> INTERESTING, RIGHT?\nDON LEMON IS WITH ME NOW. >> TO SAY THE LEAST.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT COLIN POWELL'S E-MAILS FIRST BECAUSE\nYOU ASKED HER ABOUT THAT AND SHE SORT OF PUNTED ON THAT QUESTION.\nBUT I THINK SHE'S IN A DIFFICULT PLACE WITH COMMENTING ON COLIN\nPOWELL'S E-MAILS BECAUSE, \"A,\" HE'S VERY WELL RESPECTED WITHIN\nTHE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, AND FRANKLY SHE NEEDS\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTES, RIGHT? >> YEAH.\n>> AND ALSO MANY DEMOCRATS LIKE COLIN POWELL.\nSO SHE CAN'T COME OUT AND SAY OH, MY GOSH THAT WAS A HORRIBLE\nTHING TO SAY AND WHAT A HORRIBLE MAN.\n>> YEAH, YEAH. AND HE'S RESPECTED IN STILL\nCONSERVATIVE STILL RESPECT HIM YOU KNOW THOSE WHO ARE SORT OF\nNEVER TRUMPERS, RIGHT. BUT, SHE YOU'RE RIGHT I THINK\nYOU ANSWERED THE QUESTION. SHE IS IN A VERY DIFFICULT\nPOSITION WHEN IT COMES TO COLIN POWELL AND THAT'S WHY SHE SAID I\nREALLY DON'T WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT.\nYOU DO HAVE TO HAVE OF SYMPATHY FOR COLIN POWELL.\nSOME OF THE E-MAILS THAT YOU WRITE OR I WRITE MAY NOT BE FOR\nPUBLIC CONSUMPTION. HIS WERE A LITTLE BIT HARSH IN\nTHE CRITICISM OF THE CLINTONS. BUT THEY MAY NOT BE FOR PUBLIC\nCONSUMPTION AND THEN YOU SEE THEM ON THE FRONT PAGE OF \"THE\nNEW YORK TIMES\" OR SOME OTHER NEWSPAPER, SO YOU DO HAVE TO\nHAVE A LITTLE BIT OF CONCERN FOR HIM.\nAND I'M SURE THERE ARE SOME E-MAILS THAT SHE HAS WRITTEN YOU\nKNOW TO PEOPLE ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE OR ABOUT THINGS THAT SHE\nWOULD NOT LIKE TO SEE, YOU KNOW, ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE\nNEWSPAPER. >> BUT, BUT, STILL WHAT COLIN\nPOWELL SAID IN THOSE E-MAILS MANY PEOPLE THINK --\n>> AND MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE. >> HIS E-MAILS WERE QUITE\nREFRESHING SO THAT SHE COULDN'T RESPOND TO CHARGES THAT SHE WAS\nARR ARROGANT, WHICH ARE OUT THERE\nANYWAY, IS, WHAT, KIND OF DISTURBING?\nSHOULDN'T SHE HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT NOW?\n>> SHE SHOULD HAVE AN ANSWER AND THAT'S WHY I PRESSED HER ON IT,\nON HER HUBRIS BASICALLY SAYING SHE IS ARROGANT AND STEPS ON HER\nOWN MESSAGE. WHICH SHE DOES.\nAT THE TIME RIGHT NOW SHE'S DEALING WITH THE E-MAIL ISSUE.\nRIGHT? THAT SHE DIDN'T FOLLOW GOOD\nADVICE. AND THAT, YOU KNOW, SUPPOSEDLY\nSHE TOOK HIS ADVICE AND HE'S SAYING, NO, YOU DID NOT TAKE MY\nADVICE. I DIDN'T ADVISE YOU TO DO THAT.\nSHE'S ALSO DEALING WITH THE HEALTH THING AND PEOPLE SAY SHE\nSHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE TRANSPARENT ABOUT.\nIF SHE HAD BEEN MORE TRANSPARENT ABOUT IT PERHAPS WE WOO NOT HAVE\nTHE VIDEO OF HER WOBBLING GETTING INTO THE VAN.\nAND THEN YOU KNOW, THE OTHER ISSUES THAT SHE'S DEALING WITH\nTHAT PEOPLE DON'T FIND HER TO BE TRUTHFUL ABOUT.\nSO, YEAH, SHE NEEDS TO ADDRESS THAT.\nBUT SHE'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO TURN THIS AROUND, TO A DONALD\nTRUMP BEING TRANSPARENT, AND ALSO THE E-MAILS, HACKING, AND\nRUSSIA'S INFLUENCE IN THE ELECTION.\nTHAT'S WHERE SHE'S GOING TO PIVOT TO.\n>> THAT IS HER LINE OF SPIN AT THE MOMENT.\nSPEAKING OF DONALD TRUMP, YOU KNOW THE DR. OZ SHOW IS ON RIGHT\nNOW. WE HAVE --\n>> IS THIS HAPPENING? >> IT'S HAPPENING NOW, DON.\n>> WE HAVE A BIT MORE OF WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAID TO DR. OZ ON\nHIS SHOW. SO LET'S LISTEN TOGETHER.\n>> HOW DO YOU STAY HEALTHY ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL?\n>> WELL, IT'S A LOT OF WORK. YOU KNOW WHEN I'M SPEAKING IN\nFRONT OF 15,000 AND 20,000 PEOPLE AND I'M UP THERE USING A\nLOT OF EMOTION I GUESS IN ITS OWN WAY IT'S A -- IT'S PRETTY\nHEALTHY ACT. AND I REALLY ENJOY DOING IT, A\nLOT OF TIMES SHE'S ROOMS ARE VERY HOT LIKE SAUNAS.\nAND I GUESS THAT'S A FORM OF EXERCISE, AND, YOU KNOW.\n>> TALKING ABOUT THE CANDIDATE'S MEDICAL RECORDS.\n>> RIGHT. >> I'D LIKE TO CLEAR UP SOME\nQUESTIONS FOR FOLKS WHO ARE ASKING ABOUT YOUR HEALTH.\n>> OKAY. >> I'M HOPING TO GO AFTER THESE\nEXACT SAME QUESTIONS WITH SECRETARY CLINTON.\nAS A DOCTOR WHEN I HAVE SOMEONE IN FRONT OF ME AND I DON'T KNOW\nMUCH ABOUT THEM. I DO SOMETHING CALLED THE REVIEW\nOF SYSTEMS. WE ALL DO.\nWE LEARN THIS IN MEDICAL SCHOOL. IT'S A CHECKLIST HEAD TO TOE OF\nWHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR BODY. >> OKAY.\n>> I WALK THROUGH THESE QUESTIONS.\nWE START WITH THE HEAD. SO HAVE YOU EVER HAD A NECK\nISSUES? >> NO.\n>> NEUROLOGIC PROBLEMS? STROKES, HEADACHES?\n>> NO. >> ANY PROBLEMS WITH --\n>> WATER AROUND HERE? -- NO THE ANSWER IS NO, I'VE\nHAD -- NO, NO PROBLEM. >> HORMONE PROBLEMS, THYROID\nISSUES? >> NO.\n>> BLOOD SUGAR, DIABETES? >> NOPE.\n>> ANY HEART PROBLEMS? >> NO.\n>> I KNOW YOU'RE ON LIPITOR. >> I TAKE A STATIN.\nI DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD MENTION THE NAME.\nI WOULD. BUT I TAKE A STATIN'.\nAND ACTUALLY, I'VE EXPERIMENTED WITH THREE STATINS AND ONE SEEMS\nFOR ME TO WORK THE BEST. AND IT'S REALLY BROUGHT MY\nCHOLESTEROL DOWN INTO A GOOD RANGE\n>> HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN ON IT. >> A COUPLE OF YEARS I WOULD\nSAY. >> LUNG COMPLAINTS, ASTHMA,\nWHEEZING? >> NOTHING.\nNO REALLY NOTHING. PEOPLE ARE AMAZED BECAUSE, I\nDON'T GET MUCH WITH THE COLDS, SOMETIMES IN THE SPRING, OR IN\nTHE FALL I'LL GET A LITTLE HAY FEVER.\nAND THAT COMES AND GOES. ACTUALLY, I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS\nWOULD BE, USED TO BE WORSE WHEN I WAS YOUNG.\nMAYBE IT'S GIVEN UP ON ME. BUT, WHEN I WAS YOUNG, IT WAS --\nIT COULD BE PRETTY, YOU KNOW, PRETTY ROUGH THE HAY FEVER.\nBUT, VERY, VERY LITTLE NOW. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S SOMETHING\nTHAT YOU'RE SURPRISED AT. I HAVEN'T HAD A COLD IN A LONG\nTIME. YEARS.\n>> STOMACH PROBLEMS, INTESTINE ISSUES, REFLUX, DIVER TICK\nLIGHTOUS? >> NO.\n>> BLADDER OR PROSTATE ISSUES? THE ONE LETTER THAT WAS RELEASED\nHAD A LOW PSA. >> YEAH, MY PSA'S BEEN VERY\nGOOD. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON BUT\nSO MANY OF MY FRIENDS ARE HAVING PROBLEMS WHERE THEY'RE GETTING\nTHE OPERATION OR GOING FOR RADIATION.\nAND IT'S ALWAYS THE FIRST NUMBER I ASK FOR.\nGIVE ME THAT NUMBER. I WANT TO KNOW AND MY NUMBER'S\nBEEN AS YOU SAID A VERY GOOD NUMBER.\n>> ANY HISTORY OF PERSONAL CANCER?\n>> NO. >> SKIN ISSUES?\n>> NO, VERY LITTLE. PROBABLY, YOU COULD SAY, I TRY\nAND STAY OUT OF THE SUN FOR THE MOST PART.\nI WEAR A HAT. I PLAY GOLF.\nAND I WEAR A HAT. BUT I'VE HAD NO PROBLEM, NO\nMAJOR PROBLEM. BUT CERTAINLY NO PROBLEM WITH\nSKIN. >> BLOOD CLOTS OR ANY OTHER\nBLOOD PROBLEMS? >> NO, NO.\n>> LET ME TURN TO FAMILY HISTORY --\n>> I HAVE TO BE VERY BORING FOR YOU.\nIT'S GOT TO BE VERY BORING. >> THIS IS WHAT I DO AS A\nDOCTOR. >> I WOULD TELL YOU, MY WIFE'S A\nBIG FAN OF YOUR SHOW AND I WOULD ABSOLUTELY SAY, BECAUSE, I VIEW\nTHIS AS IN A WAY GOING TO SEE MY DOCTOR.\nJUST A LITTLE BIT PUBLIC, THAT'S ALL.\n>> BY THE WAY, DR. SANJAY GUPTA IS LISTENING TO ALL OF THIS.\nHE'S GOING TO JOIN ME A LITTLE BIT LATER TO GIVE YOU HIS TAKE\nON IT. I WANT TO BRING IN LYNN SWEET,\nWASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF OF THE CHICAGO SUN TIMES AND PAUL\nSINGER EDITOR FOR \"USA TODAY\" AND YOU GUYS WILL JOIN DON LEMON\nIN OUR DISCUSSION OF THIS. SO YOU HEAR DONALD TRUMP ON THE\nDOCTOR OZ SHOW. DR. OZ IS ASKING HIM THESE\nQUESTIONS. HE'S GIVING THEM GREAT ANSWERS\nABOUT HIS HEALTH. DO YOU FEEL RELIEVED, LYNN?\n>> NO. FIRST OF ALL, TO DR. OZ, WHO\nCOULD SIT THERE AS A PHYSICIAN AND HAVE SOMEBODY TELL YOU THAT\nWAVING YOUR ARMS IS EXERCISE, AND YOU DON'T DO A FOLLOW-UP\nQUESTION? >> THANK YOU, LYNN.\nTHEY'RE VERY MUCH. >> PLEASE.\n>> THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I THOUGHT.\nTHAT'S NOT EXERCISE. >> THAT'S PREPOSTEROUS.\nAND IF YOU REALLY WERE THERE TO HELP THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\nUNDERSTAND THE HEALTH OF A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, YOU\nDON'T DO THIS FAKE MEDICAL HISTORY, LETTING DONALD TRUMP\nJUST FILIBUSTER AND EAT UP TIME. ASK HIM CRISP QUESTIONS, AND YOU\nKNOW WHAT? WHY DOESN'T HE GET TO THE LEAD\nFIRST AND I DON'T BELIEVE HE DID NOT KNOW OR COULD NOT HAVE KNOWN\nTHE NUMBERS AHEAD OF TIME AND THEN ASKED A CRISPER INTERVIEW.\nBUT THIS WAS A TV SHOW. AND IF THIS IS WHAT DONALD TRUMP\nTHOUGHT WAS A BUSINESS-LIKE WAY TO TALK ABOUT A SERIOUS TOPIC,\nTHE HEALTH OF A 70-YEAR-OLD PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE THEN I\nTHINK, THINK AGAIN IF HE REALLY WANTED TO PUT A LID ON QUESTIONS\nABOUT HIS HEALTH. >> WELL -- HERE'S THE THINGS YOU\nKNOW. HE TALKED ABOUT BEING YOU KNOW,\nHE'S STANDING IN A HOT ROOM. WELL HE SAID THAT AT A CANTON,\nOHIO, RALLY LAST NIGHT, PAUL. HE SAID COULD HILLARY CLINTON\nSTAND IN THIS ROOM, WHICH IS AT 122 DEGREES, WHICH, BY THE WAY I\nTHINK WAS A LITTLE BIT OF AN EXAGGERATION.\nIT WASN'T QUITE THAT HOT. BUT STILL HE SAID STANDING IN\nTHIS HOT ROOM, HE SAID COULD HILLARY CLINTON DO THIS?\nSO, THIS ISN'T GOING TO STOP, RIGHT, PAUL?\n>> NO. IN FACT IT IS HARD THIS TIME IN\nAN ELECTION CYCLE TO CHANGE THE NARRATIVE ABOUT EITHER OF THESE\nCANDIDATES. WE KNOW A LOT ABOUT BOTH OF\nTHEM. YET, HILLARY CLINTON'S STUMBLE,\nMAYBE A MINOR FAINT, PERHAPS, LAST WEEKEND, HAS CHANGED THE\nDIALOGUE. WE'RE NOW TALKING ALL ABOUT THE\nHEALTH OF THESE TWO CANDIDATES. WHICH IS A BETTER CONVERSATION\nFOR DONALD TRUMP TO BE HAVING AND FOR HILLARY CLINTON TO BE\nHAVING. PEOPLE DON'T TRUST HILLARY\nCLINTON AND THIS HAS OPENED THE DOOR FOR AN ACTUAL CONVERSATION,\nONE OF THE FIRST CONVERSATIONS, QUESTIONS SHE'LL BE ASKED AT THE\nFIRST DEBATE IS HOW WILL YOUR HEALTH?\nTHIS WAS A GOOD MOMENT FOR DONALD TRUMP AND EVEN HIS TV\nSHOW HAD NO REAL MEDICAL VALUE BUT IT WAS A GREAT PRESENTATION\nFOR DONALD TRUMP. IT'S GOOD TV.\nONCE AGAIN, HE HAS MANAGED TO INSERT AN ISSUE INTO THIS\nDEBATE, INTO THIS CAMPAIGN THAT WE DID NOT THINK WAS GOING TO BE\nTHE MAJOR TOPIC WE'D BE DISCUSSING A FEW WEEKS BEFORE\nEARLY VOTING STARTS. >> I WANT TO TALK TO MY\nCOLLEAGUE DON LEMON YOU KNOW THAT'S GOING TO BE THE\nCONVERSATION ALL DAY TODAY. IT'S GOING TO BE ABOUT DONALD\nTRUMP'S HEALTH, HIS APPEARANCE ON DR. OZ AND HILLARY CLINTON'S\nRELEASE OF HER MEDICAL RECORDS. >> THAT'S WHAT IT IS.\nHE'S A SHOWMAN AND OBJECTIVELY I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THIS IS\nALL ABOUT SHOW BUSINESS. WE LEARNED NOTHING FROM THAT\nDR. OZ INTERVIEW ABOUT DONALD TRUMP.\nIT'S LIKE CAROL, DO YOU HAVE HIGH CHOLESTEROL?\n>> NO, DON, I DON'T. >> HAVE YOU HAD YOUR HEART\nCHECKED? WHAT INFORMATION, WHAT GOOD DOES\nTHAT DO TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC? NOTHING.\nIF HE REALLY WANTED TO BE TRANSPARENT WHAT DONALD TRUMP\nWOULD DO IS RELEASE HIS MEDICAL RECORDS AND BE DONE WITH IT.\nSHOW THE ACTUAL NUMBERS AND BE DONE WITH IT.\nNOT GO ON A TELEVISION SHOW. IT'S HIS PREROGATIVE TO GO ON.\nBUT THIS IS NOTHING BUT A SHOW. AND JUST TO GO BACK JUST A\nLITTLE BIT, BECAUSE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON,\nCOLIN POWELL IN THESE E-MAILS ALSO HAD SOME SCATHING WORDS TO\nSAY ABOUTDOM AS WELL AND WHERE HE THINKS DONALD TRUMP IS TAKING\nTHIS ELECTION. HILLARY CLINTON MENTIONED THE\nHATE THAT SHE BELIEVES IS HAPPENING IN THIS ELECTION AND\nSO DID COLIN POWELL CALL HIM OUT ON THE HATE AND SAYING THE\nBIRTHER THING WITH THE PRESIDENT WAS RACIST AND AWFUL, AND THAT\nHE WAS APPEALING TO THE LOWEST OF THE REPUBLICAN ELECTORATE BY\nGOING AFTER THE PRESIDENT, AND BY, BY, YOU KNOW, WHAT HE'S\nDOING IN THIS ELECTION. NOT JUST HILLARY CLINTON THAT\nHE'S CRITICIZING, THIS IS ALL A BIG SHOW RIGHT NOW.\nAND WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO KNOW, THE ACTUAL NUMBERS FROM THE\nCANDIDATE. >> OKAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK MORE\nABOUT THIS, THOUGH, EVERYBODY STICK AROUND.\nAS I SAID DR. SANJAY GUPTA, HE'S WATCHING THE DR. OZ SHOW, DONALD\nTRUMP IS STILL TALKING. AND SANJAY WILL BREAK IT DOWN TO\nUS AFTER A BREAK. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.      What I love most about",

POWERING THROUGH.RYING TO KEEP -\nWHICH I THINK IS COMMON EXPERIENCE FOR PEOPLE.\nSO WE'RE GOING TO PUT OUT MORE INFORMATION, AND THAT WILL BE\nTHEN, TWICE AS MUCH AS HE PUT OUT.\nAND WE'LL SEE WHAT, IF ANYTHING, HE'S WILLING TO DISCLOSE.\n>> SECRETARY HILLARY CLINTON, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A BREAK, AND\nTHEN WE'LL COME BACK. >> DISCLOSURE TRANSPARENCY.\nBIG WORDS COMING UP HERE. LET'S BRING IN DON LEMON ALSO\nJOINING US CNN'S CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT DR. SANJAY GUPTA.\nWE'LL TALK HEALTH. WE'LL TALK THE POLITICS HERE.\nSHE WAS VERY DIRECTED IN HER ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS DON,\nWHAT DID YOU PICK UP? >> FIRST BEFORE WE GET THERE\nBECAUSE I HAVE SANJAY HERE. WHEN SHE STARTED TALKING THE\nFIRST THING I NOTICED WAS THAT SHE DIDN'T SOUND THE WAY SHE\nSOUNDED THIS WEEKEND IN THE INTERVIEW WITH ANDERSON, RIGHT?\nSHE SOUNDED LIKE, HI DON! THIS IS THE ANSWER TO MY\nQUESTION, I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS DELIBERATE BUT SHE DID SOUND\nSTRONGER AND EVERYONE WHO IS ON THE TOM JOYNER MORNING SHOW SAID\nYOU DO SOUND STRONGER. THAT WAS RECORDED YESTERDAY.\nBUT SHE SEEMED TO, YOU KNOW, INTIMATE THAT SHE'S GOING TO\nRELEASE MORE RECORDS AS SHE DID YESTERDAY A DOCTOR'S LETTER.\nBUT I'M WONDERING FROM SANJAY WHAT ELSE CAN SHE RELEASE?\nIS THERE MORE? >> THE BIG QUESTION HAS BEEN,\nLOOK, ARE YOU GOING TO RELEASE RECORDS?\nARE YOU GOING TO RELEASE ESSENTIALLY WHAT IS A SUMMY DONE\nBY SOMEONE'S INTERPRETATION OF THOSE RECORDS WHO HAPPENS TO BE\nSOMEONE WHO YOU'RE COLLEGIAL WITH.\nYOUR DOCTOR/FRIEND SORT OF PERSON.\nAGAIN IT'S NOT TO SUGGEST THAT'S WHAT'S IN THOSE SUMMARIES IS\nINACCURATE BUT SOMETIMES THE REASON YOU LOOK AT MEDICAL\nRECORDS, BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW.\nYOU DON'T KNOW -- AND SO THERE ARE CERTAIN QUESTIONS THAT COME\nUP. FIRST OF ALL, TO ANSWER YOUR\nQUESTION, I DOUBT WE'RE GOING TO SEE ANYTHING MORE.\nI DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE ANYTHING MORE FROM HER --\n>> RAW DATA. >> RAW DATA.\n>> I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.\nBUT THAT'S BEEN SORT OF THE BIG QUESTION, BASICALLY THEY'VE MET\nTHE STANDARD THAT OTHER CAMPAIGNS HAVE HAD IN TERMS OF\nWHAT THEY HAVE -- >> EXCEPT JOHN McCAIN THEY\nREALLY HAVE. >> BUT YOU KNOW THE IDEA OF\nRELEASING MEDICAL RECORDS AND LETTING SOMEONE INDEPENDENT LOOK\nAT THOSE THINGS AND JUST MAKING SURE THAT ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT\nDETERMINE IF SOMEONE'S FIT TO LEAD ARE ANSWERED.\n>> LET'S BRING IN DAVID GREGORY, CNN'S POLITICAL ANALYST.\nDAVID, WHAT DID YOU HEAR IN DON'S INTERVIEW?\nI MEAN SHE TOUCHED A LOT OF BASES.\nSHE TALKED ABOUT RUSSIA, SHE TALKED ABOUT TAXES, SHE TALKED\nABOUT COLIN POWELL. WHAT DID YOU HEAR?\n>> WELL I WANT TO COME BACK TO RUSSIA IN JUST A SECOND.\nSANJAY SAID SOMETHING EARLIER THAT I THINK IS REALLY\nIMPORTANT. I THINK YOU WANT AS MUCH\nINFORMATION AS YOU CAN GET, AND TO YOUR POINT, ALISYN, YOU MAY\nNOT WANT, I HAVE IMAGES HERE OF MY MEDICAL RESULTS.\nSHALL WE SHOW THEM? >> NO, THANK YOU.\n>> I KNOW. BUT THE POINT IS, TO SANJAY'S\nPOINT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO DO ALL THAT BUT YOU WANT\nSOMEBODY WHO IS INDEPENDENT WHO CAN DO THIS KIND OF REVIEW.\nMcCAIN IS DIFFERENT. HE HAD CANCER.\nHE HAD MELANOMA. BUT I THINK MORE INFORMATION IS\nBETTER THAN LESS. I KEEP GETTING CAUGHT UP IN\nHILLARY CLINTON'S ARGUMENT THAT SHE WANTS TO BE COMPARED TO\nDONALD TRUMP. THAT'S NOT THE STANDARD.\nHIS DISCLOSURES ARE INSUFFICIENT.\nI THINK THAT CAN BE SAID OBJECTIVELY BASED ON PRECEDENT\nIN A PRESIDENTIAL RUN. BUT SHE SHOULD BE STILL\nRELEASING MORE, AND THE -- SHE SHOULD BE COMPARED TO WHAT IS\nREASONABLE IN THIS REGARD. AND AS MUCH AS YOU CAN PUT OUT\nIS APPROPRIATE AND SHOULD BE INDEPENDENTLY REVIEWED BY PEOPLE\nLIKE DR. GUPTA, AND OTHERS WHO HAVE DONE IT IN THE PAST WHO CAN\nMAKE A JUDGMENT. THE RUSSIA PIECE IS INTERESTING\nBECAUSE I THINK IT'S VERY GOOD POLITICS.\nIT HAPPENS TO BE REALLY FRIGHTENING THAT RUSSIA IS GOING\nTO THE LENGTHS THAT IT'S GOING TO POTENTIALLY INFLUENCE THE\nELECTION. TO HACK TOP PEOPLE IN THE\nCOUNTRY IN POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY, TO HACK THEIR\nE-MAILS. THAT SHOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT\nCONCERN. JUST AS CYBER TERROR AND CYBER\nCRIME SHOULD BE A CONCERN MORE GENERALLY IN OUR NATIONAL\nSECURITY. >> THERE'S ANOTHER PART OF THE\nINTERVIEW THAT AIRS. IT'S PROBABLY AIRING NOW BECAUSE\nTHEY TOOK A BREAK IN -- WHERE SHE TALKS ABOUT HER DEPLORABLES\nCOMMENT WHERE SHE DOUBLED DOWN ON THE HATE AND THE ALT-RIGHT\nAND WHAT SHE THIS DONALD TRUMP IS ATTRACTING --\n>> SHE'S NOT APOLOGIZING -- >> SHE'S NOT APOLOGIZING.\nSHE IN FACT USED THE WORD DEPLORABLE HERSELF.\nSHE SAID I HAVE CRITICIZED HIS DEPLORABLE -- I HAVE CRITICIZED\nHIS DEPLORABLE CAMPAIGN. SHE'S DOUBLING DOWN ON THAT --\n>> IT'S THE 50% SHE SAID SHE OVERREACHED.\n>> I THINK SHE'S PUSHING BACK BECAUSE SHE THIS SHE'S RIGHT ON\nTHIS ISSUE. AND I THINK SHE -- PEOPLE WERE A\nLITTLE BIT UPSET THAT THEY YOU KNOW SHE APPEARED TO BACK DOWN A\nLITTLE BIT. SO SHE DID DISCUSS THAT.\nBUT SHE KEEPS PUSHING TRANSPARENCY, RUSSIA, DONALD\nTRUMP IS NOT TRANSPARENT AS SHE IS, RUSSIA OR AT ALL SHE DOESN'T\nBELIEVE LESS SO THAN ANY OTHER CANDIDATE AND SHE IS NOT AGAIN\nNOT BACKING DOWN REALLY DOUBLING DOWN ON THE HATRED THAT SHE\nBELIEVES HE'S STIRRING UP -- >> THAT'S DIFFERENT.\nTHE DEPLORABLES IS ABOUT HIS OWN CAMPAIGN AND WHAT HE HAS SAID IS\nDIFFERENT THAN WHAT SHE SAID ABOUT HIS SUPPORTERS.\nI MEAN THAT'S WHERE PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WENT A BRIDGE TOO\nFAR. DID SHE SAY ANYTHING ABOUT HIS\nSUPPORTERS OR WAS SHE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN HE'S\nRUNNING? >> SHE SAID HIS CAMPAIGN.\nSHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT HIS SUPPORTERS.\n>> I THINK THAT'S DIFFERENT. >> IT'S ALWAYS BAD AS YOU KNOW,\nCOMING FROM A POLITICAL FAMILY, TO YOU KNOW, SAY BAD THINGS\nABOUT VOTERS EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT YOUR SUPPORTERS.\n>> YOU DON'T ATTACK -- >> ATTACK A CAMPAIGN BUT NOT THE\nVOTERS. >> JUST A HUMAN BEING, WHEN YOU\nATTACK SOMEBODY'S SUPPORT BASE IN ANYTHING YOU'RE MAKING A\nMISTAKE. ESPECIALLY WHAT WE'VE SEEN\nLEARNED IN THE PRIMARIES HERE THAT WHEN YOU DISRESPECT TRUMP,\nTHAT'S OKAY IF IT'S ON THE MERITS.\nWHEN YOU DISRESPECT PEOPLE FOR BELIEVING AND WANTING CHANGE AND\nBEING ANGRY ABOUT STATUS QUO YOU WIND UP BEING --\n>> I ALSO SPOKE WITH HER ABOUT THE POLLS AND SHE SAID YOU KNOW,\nSTANDARD ANSWER, I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THIS CAMPAIGN WAS GOING\nTO BE CLOSE. THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.\nBUT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT HILLARY CLINTON YOU KNOW\nHISTORY, HER RESUME, WHAT SHE'S DONE, HOW LONG SHE'S BEEN AROUND\nI MEAN YOU KNOW OBJECTIVELY YOU SHOULD SAY SHE SHOULD BE FURTHER\nAHEAD IN THE POLLS. IN A POLITICAL --\n>> EXCEPT THE GOP THIS IS THEIR RACE TO WIN.\n>> YEAH. >> CYCLICALLY THIS IS THEIR RACE\nTO WIN AND MANY ARGUE SHE'S -- >> HERTZ TO LOSE.\n>> THAT'S RIGHT. WELL THAT WAS THE PRESUMPTION\nNOW IN THIS PERIOD, IT CAN GO EITHER WAY.\nAND MANY PEOPLE SUGGEST YEAH SHE SHOULD BE BEATING TRUMP BECAUSE\nOF HER RESUME BUT IF SHE'D BEEN RUNNING AGAINST A JOHN KASICH\nSHE MAY HAVE HAD MORE THAN SHE COULD HANDLE WELL BEFORE THIS\nPOINT. >> EXACTLY.\n>> DAVID, WHAT ARE -- >> I'M JUST LOOKING AT OUR\nBANNER WHEN SHE SAYS THAT SHE ALWAYS KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE A\nCLOSE RACE. NO THAT'S NOT TRUE.\nI WAS LOOKING AT VIDEOTAPE JUST EARLIER ON YOUTUBE ABOUT SHE AND\nOTHERS IN THE MEDIA SAYING THAT TRUMP WAS -- WAS A JOKE THAT HE\nWASN'T A SERIOUS CANDIDATE. SO YOU CAN'T SAY YOU ALWAYS\nTHOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE CLOSE.\nAND THE REALITY IS IN GOING AFTER SOME OF HIS SUPPORTERS,\nSOME OF WHICH IS CERTAINLY ACCURATE IN TERMS OF THE VIEWS\nOF SOME OF HIS SUPPORTERS, WHETHER THEY'RE ANTI-SEMITIC OR\nRACIST OR HOMOPHOBIC OR ISLAMAPHOBIC, THAT IS JUST TRUE.\nAND THE TRUTH IS THAT TRUMP HAS NOT STOOD UP TO SOME OF THOSE\nPEOPLE. ANTI-SEMITES, FOR EXAMPLE, GIVEN\nTHE FACT THAT HE HAS A JEWISH GRANDSON, AND HAS NOT STOOD UP\nTO THOSE PEOPLE WITHIN HIS OWN CAMPAIGN.\nSO, SHE'S GOT REASON TO DO THAT BUT THE POINT IS, IT'S GLOSSING\nOVER THE FACT WHEN SHE MADE A COMMENT LIKE THAT --\n>> HE HAS A JEWISH DAUGHTER. SHE CONVERTED.\n>> PRECISELY. -- AND AS YOU KNOW I MEAN\nCONVERTS IN THE JEWISH HELD UP ABOVE ALL IN THE BIBLE.\nBUT THE POINT IS THERE ARE CERTAINLY THERE ARE FACTORS HERE\nABOUT THE SUPPORT FOR TRUMP THAT GO WELL BEYOND THAT.\nAND OF COURSE NOBODY LIKES TO BELIEVE ABOUT THEMSELVES THAT\nTHEY MAY BE BIASED OR RACIST, OR IN ANY WAY AND SO THAT'S WHY\nTHAT JUST KIND OF MISSED THE MARK ON HER POINT OF WHAT SHE\nWAS TRYING TO SAY. >> WE HAVE THAT PART DAVID LET'S\nLISTEN TO IT. >> DONALD TRUMP HAS RUN A\nDEPLORABLE CAMPAIGN. HE HAS ACCEPTED SUPPORT AND BEEN\nCHEERED ON BY THE LIKES OF DAVID DUKE, THE FORMER GRAND WIZARD OF\nTHE KU KLUX KLAN AND OTHER WHITE SUPREMACISTS.\nIN FACT, IT WAS AMAZING THE OTHER DAY HIS RUNNING MATE, MIKE\nPENCE, WOULDN'T EVEN CALL FORMER KKK LEADER DAVID DUKE\nDEPLORABLE. AND, AND I DO THINK WE HAVE TO\nSPEAK OUT AGAINST THIS HATRED. YOU KNOW TRUMP ATTACKED A\nFEDERAL JUDGE FOR HIS MEXICAN HERITAGE.\nHE -- HE BULLIED A GOLD STAR FAMILY BECAUSE OF THEIR MUSLIM\nFAITH. HE PROMOTED THE LIE, AND HE\nSTILL IS PROMOTING THE LIE, THAT OUR FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT IS NOT\nA TRUE AMERICAN. >> HMM.\n>> HE CALLS WOMEN PIGS AND BIMBOS.\nSO, -- >> YEAH.\nAND IT'S TRUE AND THAT'S YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK THAT MAYBE\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS A LITTLE BIT TONE DEAF THEY THEY AT LEAST\nTHEY SAY THAT THEY DON'T THINK THAT THE BIRTHER THING IS A BIG\nDEAL AND WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE JOBS AND\nWHATEVER. OF COURSE THAT'S IMPORTANT.\nBUT, BY DOING WHAT DONALD TRUMP DID WITH THE BIRTHER THING,\nTAKING IT BEYOND WHEREVER IT STARTED, SENDING PEOPLE TO\nAFRICA, INVESTIGATORS AT LEAST HIM SAYING THAT, DOUBLING AND\nTRIPLING DOWN ON THAT, AND THEN SAYING HE DIDN'T BELIEVE THE\nBIRTH CERTIFICATE WAS ACCURATE. THAT INSULTED 99.999% OF\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS. HE MAY NOT SEE IT AS RACIAL.\nMAYBE THAT WAS NOT HIS INTENT. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT -- I DO\nBELIEVE THAT THAT WAS -- THAT WAS THE RESULT, WHETHER OR NOT\nTHAT WAS HIS OBVIOUS INTENT. AND SO THAT'S INSULTING TO\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS AND HE STILL HAS YET TO APOLOGIZE FOR THAT\nAND I THINK THAT IS GOING TO HURT HIM WHEN IT COMES TO BLACK\nSUPPORT. >> HE APPARENTLY STILL BELIEVES\nIT. HE NOT ONLY HAS APOLOGIZED\nTHERE'S NO INDICATION THAT HE DOESN'T STILL BELIEVE THAT.\n>> RUDY GIULIANI AND HIS SURROGATES SAY HE BELIEVES THE\nPRESIDENT WAS BORN IN THE UNITED STATES BUT HE HAS YET TO SAY\nTHAT -- >> RIGHT.\n>> THE POINT IS THAT I THINK DON AS YOU POINT OUT THIS WAS ABSURD\nTHAT HE EVER WOULD ADVANCE THIS NOTION AND HE WANTS TO BE\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME, YOU'RE\nINTERVIEW WITH HILLARY CLINTON AND WHAT SHE SAID HOW SHE BROKE\nDOWN THOSE EXAMPLES THEY'VE GOT AN AD UP I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S IN\nTHE BATTLEGROUNDS, IT WAS CERTAINLY ON NATIONAL CABLE I\nSAW IT ON OUR AIR IN WHICH SHE TAKE HIS CRITICISM OF HER, THAT\nSHE'S INSULTED YOU KNOW SEGMENTS OF THE ELECTORATE, WHICH SHE DID\nIN THAT BASKET OF DEPLORABLES REMARK, AND THEN SHOWS ALL OF\nTHE EXAMPLES THAT SHE LISTED TO YOU AND SAYS, RIGHT, WE AGREE\nWITH HIM EXACTLY YOU SHOULDN'T DO THAT.\nSO I THINK SHE'S WILLING TO TAKE HER LUMPS, THAT THIS WAS\nSOMETHING THAT SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID.\nSHE OFFENDED SOME PEOPLE. BUT, YOU KNOW, WHETHER IT HAD\nSOME RESONANCE IN THE POLLS AGAINST HER WE'RE GOING TO FIND\nOUT. BUT SHE'S TRYING TO COUNTERPUNCH\nHERE BY BRINGING UP ALL THESE AREAS WHERE HE SAID AND BELIEVED\nWHAT HE BELIEVES. >> DAVID, SANJAY, DON, THANK YOU\nDON THANKS SO FOR SHARING THAT INTERVIEW WITH US.\nALL RIGHT THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION AND CLINTON FOUNDATION UNDER THE\nMICROSCOPE TODAY SO WE'RE TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT BOTH OF THEM\nTHIS MORNING STARTING WITH WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN TO DONALD TRUMP'S\nORGANIZATION IF HE IS ELECTED PRESIDENT.\nWE DISCUSS THAT NEXT.",

HOW DO YOU RATE IT?\n>> WE RATED THIS FALSE. IT'S NOT ACCURATE.\nHE KEEPS SAYING IT. WE'VE BEEN FACT CHECKING THIS\nONE ALONG WITH ALL THE OTHER FACT CHECKERS FOR MONTHS.\nHE POINTS TO AN \"ESQUIRE\" ARTICLE THAT WAS PUBLISHED WELL\nAFTER THE WAR STARTED. SO, THIS ONE IS JUST WRONG, TOO.\n>> HE HAS THAT TRANSCRIPT THAT HIS SUPPORTERS REFER TO THAT\nDOES NOT HELP HIS CAUSE.

THE TAX RETURNS WOULD SHOW WHICH\nOF HIS ASSETS PRODUCED INCOME. THEY WOULD SHOW SOME OF HIS\nFINANCIAL TIES. AND THEY WOULD SHOW HOW MUCH HE\nGIVES TO CHARITY. THAT'S BECOME AN ISSUE IN RECENT\nWEEKS. ABOUT THE TAX RETURNS ARE NOT\nRELEASED SO THERE ARE ALL THESE THINGS THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP'S FINANCES THAT WE NORMALLY KNOW ABOUT THE MAJOR\nCANDIDATES. >> WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON HOW\nDIFFICULT THE CLIMATE IS RIGHT NOW?\nYOU HAVE CLINTON GIVES OUT 40 YEARS OF TAXES AND FRUMP WON'T\nGIVE OUT ANY BECAUSE HE'S UNDER PROOF OF AUDIT.\nHE COULD GO BACK 30 YEARS IN TAXES, IF HE WANTED.\nHIS OPPONENT WENT 40.

SOME THINGS WE KNOW ABOUT HIS\nBUSINESS BACKGROUND AND THAT SORT OF THING IS BEING REVEALED.\nI WOULD EXPECT DONALD TRUMP TO BE CHALLENGED ON THIS DURING THE\nDEBATES. THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES\nRELEASING THEIR TAX RETURNS. NOT THAT THEY ARE REQUIRED TO,\nBUT THEY ALWAYS DO. IT'S LIKE A CULTURAL NORM.\nSO, HE'S BREAKING WITH THIS. NOW, SOMETIMES THE CANDIDATES\nDECIDE TO DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY, THE CLIMATE CHANGES, BUT THIS IS\nA BIG THING. THIS IS SIGNIFICANT INFORMATION\nTHAT'S NOT AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC.\n>> YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK THIS SHOULD BE AN ISSUE, ABOUT\nTRUMP'S WIFE. BILL CLINTON WAS DIFFERENT, HE\nWAS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nBUT SHE GIVES HER IMMIGRATION INFORMATION TO IMMIGRATION\nLAWYER AND HE PUTS OUT A LETTER VETTING IT AND THAT IS NOT\nHELPFUL TO US BECAUSE HE CAN ONLY JUDGE AS A LAWYER, NOT AS\nSOME INDEPENDENT BODY WHAT HE GAVE HER.\nTHIS HAS LITTLE TRICKY. >> WE ALWAYS WANT TO VERIFY\nINFORMATION AND WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT IT OURSELVES.\nOUR FACT-CHECKING REPORTS WE LIST ALL THE SOURCES AND IF THE\nINFORMATION IS ONLINE WE LINK TO IT.\nNOT JUST JOURNALISTS, BUT THE PUBLIC.\nTHEY DON'T WANT TO TAKE PEOPLE'S WORD FOR IT.\nTHEY WANT TO SEE THE EVIDENCE AND THE DOCUMENTATION FOR\nTHEMSELVES. >> NOW WE HAVE THIS ISSUE WITH\nTRUMP AND HIS BUSINESS DEALINGS NOT TO SUGGEST THAT THEY ARE\nBAD, BUT HE DOES SO MUCH INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS, WE\nSHOULD SHOW WHAT IT IS.
