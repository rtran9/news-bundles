DONALD TRUMP IS SEEKING SECURITY\nCLEARANCES FOR HIS CHILDREN, HIS ADULT CHILDREN, AND HIS\nSON-IN-LAW, JARED CUSHNER. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MUCH MORE ON\nTHIS DEVELOPMENT COMING UP. BRIAN TODD HAS MORE ON JARED\nCUSHNER RIGHT NOW, A MAN WHO MAY BECOME ONE OF THE MOST\nINFLUENTIAL FIGURES IN THE WHITE HOUSE.\n>> Reporter: SIGNIFICANT THAT HE IS REQUESTING A SECURITY\nCLEARANCE FOR HIM. HE'S SAID TO AVOID THE SPOTLIGHT\nWHENEVER POSSIBLE, BUT TONIGHT, CUSHNER IS BELIEVED TO BE A KEY\nPLAYER IN THE SELECTION OF CABINET MEMBERS AND WILL LIKELY\nHAVE HIS FATHER-IN-LAW'S EAR IN THE OVAL OFFICE.\n>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, PRESIDENT OBAMA.\n>> Reporter: AS DONALD TRUMP SAT IN THE OVAL OFFICE WITH\nPRESIDENT OBAMA, ONE MAN IN THE ROOM SEEMED LIKE AN ON SECURE\nJUNIOR STAFFER. SNAPPING PICTURES IN THE BACK\nWITH HIS SMARTPHONE. HE WAS LATER SEEN WALKING ON THE\nWHITE HOUSE GROUNDS WITH MR. OBAMA'S CHIEF OF STAFF.\nTONIGHT, THE SAME MAN APPEARS ON TRACK TO BECOME ONE OF THE MOST\nINFLUENTIAL PEOPLE IN THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE, MAYBE WITHOUT A\nTITLE. THE INCOMING CHIEF OF STAFF\nSPOKE ABOUT HIM ON NBC'S \"TODAY\" SHOW.\n>> I THINK JARED CUSHNER, OBVIOUSLY HIS SON-IN-LAW, IS\nGOING TO BE VERY INVOLVED IN DECISION MAKING.\n>> Reporter: TRUMP'S 35-YEAR-OLD SON-IN-LAW, MARRIED FOR SEVEN\nYEARS TO IVANKA, IS CONSIDERED SHY AND AVOIDS THE SPOTLIGHT.\n>> HE'S VERY GOOD AT POLITICS. >> Reporter: BUT IN THE TRUMP\nWHITE HOUSE, HIS POWER WILL LIKELY BE CONSIDERABLE.\n>> I THINK IT WILL BE SIMILAR TO THE ROLE HE PLAYED IN THE\nCAMPAIGN, WHICH IS INFORMAL, AND BEHIND THE SCENES, AND YET,\nMASSIVELY INFLUENTIAL. I THINK HE'S SEEN AS KIND OF A\nCONDUIT TO DONALD TRUMP AND A MAJOR DECISION MAKING PLAYER.\n>> Reporter: CUSHNER IS A BILLIONAIRE REAL ESTATE\nDEVELOPER AND PUBLISHER. >> HE HAS TIES TO WALL STREET\nINVESTORS, THE JEWISH COMMUNITY IN NEW YORK CITY, AND ALSO THE\nMEDIA COMMUNITY. >> Reporter: HE BOUGHT THE NEW\nYORK OBSERVER NEWSPAPER WHEN HE WAS 25, AND ONCE TRIED TO BUY\nTHE LOS ANGELES DODGERS. HE DIDN'T HAVE A FORMAL TITLE IN\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, BUT SOURCES SAY HE WAS AMONG THE CANDIDATE'S\nMOST TRUSTED ADVISERS. ONE SOURCE TELLING CNN THAT\nCUSHNER WAS INTIMATELY INVOLVED IN THE DECISION TO FIRE COREY\nLEWANDOWSKI LAST SUMMER. SAID TO BE INTENSELY LOYAL, HE\nONCE PUSHED BACK AGAINST HIS OWN NEWSPAPER, WHICH ACCUSED TRUMP\nOF BEING ANTI-SEMITIC. CUSHNER, AN ORTHODOX JEW, WROTE\nTHAT TRUMP EMBRACED MY FAMILY AND OUR JEWDAISM.\n>> MY SON-IN-LAW IS YOUISH, MY DAUGHTER IS JEWISH, AND I LOVE\nTHEM. >> Reporter: EXPERTS SAY THAT HE\nCOULD AVOID BREAKING A LAW IF HE DOESN'T TAKE A SALARY OR A\nFORMAL TITLE. BUT HE COULD HAVE ANOTHER\nCONFLICT. >> THEY HAVE TO BE CAREFUL THAT\nHE DOESN'T BECOME A CONDUIT OF INFORMATION, BECAUSE HE'S GOING\nTO HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS DOING, AND\nIF HE TALKS TO HIS WIFE ABOUT WHAT THE BUSINESS IS DOING,\nTHERE IS A CONFLATING OF THE BUSINESS AND OFFICIAL INTEREST.\nTHAT'S SOMETHING I THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO KEEP SEPARATE.\n>> Reporter: ONCE AGAIN TONIGHT, JIM ACOSTA REPORTING THAT DONALD\nTRUMP HAS REQUESTED SECURITY CLEARANCES FOR HIS CHILDREN AND\nJARED CUSHNER.

AND SO I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY\nTIMES WE HAVE TO RELEARN THIS LESSON, BECAUSE WE ENDED UP\nHAVING 43% OF THE COUNTRY NOT VOTING WHO WERE ELIGIBLE TO\nVOTE. BUT IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE.\n>> Reporter: AFTER INTENSE CRITICISMS, PRESIDENT OBAMA\nSOUNDED ALMOST IMPRESSED BY TRUMP'S VICTORY.\n>> WHAT'S CLEAR IS THAT HE WAS ABLE TO TAP INTO, YES, THE\nANXIETIES, BUT ALSO THE ENTHUSIASM OF HIS VOTERS IN A\nWAY THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE. >> Reporter: THE PRESIDENT\nCLEARLY TRYING TO PUT A GOOD FACE ON EMRATIC PARTY,\nWOLF, HE SAID IT'S A HEALTHY THING THE GOING THROUGH\nA TIME OF REFLECTION. THAT MAY BE AN UNDERSTATEMENT.\nAS THE PRESIDENT BEGINS TO LEAVE FOR HIS FINAL FOREIGN TRIP\nTONIGHT, IT'S CLEAR HE WANTED TO GET AHEAD OF THAT TRIP SO HE CAN\nSEND THE MESSAGE TO WORLD LEADERS THAT DONALD TRUMP WILL\nBE THE NEXT PRESIDENT, AND HE MAY NOT BE AS UNQUALIFIED AS\nPRESIDENT OBAMA ONCE DECLARED. WOLF?\n>> JEFF, THANK YOU. JEFF ZELENY IN NEW YORK CITY FOR\nUS. PRESIDENT OBAMA DECLINED TO\nCOMMENT ON DONALD TRUMP'S MOST CONTROVERSIAL APPOINTMENT,\nNAMING STEVE BANNON AS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE STRATEGIST.\nJIM ACOSTA IS WORK THING PART OF THE STORY FOR US.\nA LOT OF OUTRAGE FOR US OVER BANNON'S APPOINTMENT.\nWHAT'S THE LATEST? >> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT, WOLF.\nFIRST OF ALL, WE SHOULD POINT OUT WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM A\nTRANSITION SOURCE THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS REQUESTED TOP SECRET\nSECURITY CLEARANCES FOR HIS ADULT CHILDREN AND SON-IN-LAW,\nJARED CUSHNER, WHO IS AN IMPORTANT ADVISER.\nAS FOR STEVE BANNON, TRUMP ADVISERS ARE RUSHING TO HIS\nDEFENSE, BUT THE BANNON BACKLASH IS GROWING.\nIN SELECTING STEVE BANNON AS HIS CHIEF STRATEGIST, DONALD TRUMP\nHAS INVITED INTO THE OVAL OFFICE ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE\nSO-CALLED ALT-RIGHT. HE SAYS HE WILL ACT AS EQUAL\nPARTNERS WITH REINCE PRIEBUS, WHO WILL SERVE AS WHITE HOUSE\nCHIEF OF STAFF. WHILE TRUMP ADVISERS ARE\nPRAISING THE BANNON PICK -- >> HE'S BEEN THE GENERAL OF THIS\nCAMPAIGN. >> Reporter: BANNON IS ALREADY\nCOMING UNDER FIRE WHEN HE WAS CHAIRMAN OF BREITBART NEWS.\nFOR YEARS, HE'S CALLED FOR A TAKEOVER OF THE REPUBLICAN\nPARTY. >> WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS BITCH\nSLAP THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND GET THOSE GUYS -- IF WE HAVE TO,\nWE'LL TAKE IT OVER. >> Reporter: A SPOKESMAN FOR\nHARRY REID SAID IN A STATEMENT, PRESIDENT-ELECT'S CHOICE OF\nSTEVE BANNON AS A TOP AIDE SIGNALS THAT WHITE SUPREMIST\nALSO BE REPRESENTED AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS IN TRUMP'S WHITE\nHOUSE. >> THE GUY I KNOW IS A GUY THAT\nISN'T ANY OF THOSE THINGS. HE IS A GUY WHO IS PRETTY --\nHE'S VERY, VERY SMART. VERY TEMPERATE.\n>> Reporter: THE BANNON PICK COULD ENFLAME ANTI-TRUMP\nPROTESTERS AND RALLY A NATION THAT'S WITNESSING A RISE OF\nHATEFUL RHETORIC, AND ATTACKS ON MINORITIES, WHICH TRUMP SAID\nMUST COME TO AN END. >> I AM SO SADDENED TO HEAR\nTHAT, AND I SAY STOP IT! IF IT -- IF IT HELPS, I WILL SAY\nTHIS, AND I'LL SAY IT RIGHT TO THE CAMERA, STOP IT!\n>> Reporter: ON THE ISSUES, TRUMP IS SIGNALING A POTENTIAL\nSOFTENING ON TOPICS, SUGGESTING HE WON'T WORK TO OUTLAW SAME-SEX\nMARRIAGE. >> THESE CASES HAVE GONE TO THE\nSUPREME COURT AND HAVE BEEN SETTLED.\nAND I AM FINE WITH THAT. >> Reporter: BUT ON ANOTHER\nFRONT, ROE VERSUS WADE, TRUMP SAID HE WOULD APPOINT\nANTI-ABORTION JUDGES AND IF IT'S OVERTURNED, IT WOULD BE UP TO\nTHE STATES TO DECIDE. AS FOR TRUMP'S SIGNATURE\nCAMPAIGN ISSUE -- >> DON'T WORRY, WE'RE GOING TO\nBUILD THE WALL. >> Reporter: THE PRESIDENT-ELECT\nIS OPEN TO SOMETHING OTHER THAN A WALL ALONG THE BORDER.\n>> THERE COULD BE SOME FENCING. >> Reporter: NOW, THE TRUMP TEAM\nIS FAR FROM UNANIMOUS ON THE SELECTION OF STEVE BANNON AS\nCHIEF STRATEGIST AND THE WHITE HOUSE, I TALKED TO ONE OFFICIAL\nWHO SAID BANNON IS BEING GIVEN TOO MUCH POWER, AND DONALD TRUMP\nIS MAKING PROGRESS. HIS TRANSITION TEAM IS MAKING\nPROGRESS ON SELECTION OF JOHN BOLTON AND RUDY GIULIANI, WHO\nARE SAID TO BE TWO TOP CONTENDERS FOR SECRETARY OF\nSTATE. WOLF?\n>> JIM, THANKS. GOOD REPORTING FOR US.\nJIM ACOSTA REPORTING FROM OUTSIDE TRUMP TOWER IN NEW YORK\nCITY. LET'S GET MORE ON ALL OF THIS.\nREPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN ADAM KINSINGER OF ILLINOIS IS JOINING\nUS. THANKS FOR JOINING US.\n>> YOU BET, WOLF. >> CNN JUST LEARNED THAT TRUMP\nIS SEEKING TOP SECRET SECURITY CLEARANCES FOR HIS ADULT\nCHILDREN, INCLUDING HIS SON-IN-LAW JARED CUSHNER.\nWHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO THAT? DO YOU THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE\nTHIS CLEARANCE? >> IT'S HARD TO TELL.\nIT DEPENDS ON WHAT LEVEL OF TOP SECRET.\nTHERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE, BY THE WAY, IN THE COUNTRY THAT HAVE\nTOP SECRET SECURITY CLEARANCE, BASICALLY ANYBODY THAT DOES WHAT\nI DO IN THE MILITARY GETS IT. SO IT'S A LEVEL THAT YOU HAVE TO\nGO THROUGH SOME INTENSE BACKGROUND, BUT THAT'S DIFFERENT\nTHAN WHAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED BASICALLY PRESIDENTIAL LEVEL\nSECURITY, AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT THAT'S CALLED OR THAT\nCLASSIFICATION. BUT BASICALLY YOU'RE EXPOSED TO\nANYTHING THE PRESIDENT HAS, VERSUS JUST TOP SECRET.\nSO I'VE GOT TO GET MORE DETAILS. AND FRANKLY, I THINK IT'S AT THE\nREQUEST OF THE PRESIDENT TO MAKE A DECISION WHO HIS ADVISERS ARE,\nSO I'M NOT GOING TO QUESTION IT. >> BUT DURING THE CAMPAIGN, HE\nSAID HIS THREE ADULT CHILDREN WOULD RUN THE BUSINESS, AND\nTHERE WOULD BE A WALL BETWEEN HIM AND THEM AS FAR AS THE\nBUSINESS IS CONCERNED. THEY'LL TAKE OVER THE BUSINESS.\nHE'LL WORK 100% EXCLUSIVELY AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nIF THEY'RE GOING TO RUN THE BUSINESS, WHY WOULD THEY NEED\nTOP SECRET SECURITY CLEARANCES? >> I THINK A LOT OF THAT STUFF\nIS GOING TO SHAKE ITSELF OUT. WE'RE ON DAY SIX OF THE\nTRANSITION RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE ANOTHER TWO MONTHS TO\nGO. OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S A LOT OF\nHYPER ATTENTION TO WHAT'S GOING ON, AS THERE SHOULD BE.\nYOU HAVE A NEW PRESIDENT-ELECT, NO POLITICAL EXPERIENCE, HAS A\nBUSINESS AND HAS KIDS VERY INVOLVED.\nI THINK AS WE GO ON, I THINK YOU'LL SEE THE PRESIDENT-ELECT\nBUILD WHATEVER THAT WALL IS, THAT'S GOING TO SEPARATE HIS\nBUSINESS FROM HIS DUTIES AS PRESIDENCY.\nAND I THINK AGAIN, GIVING YOUR CHILDREN TOP SECRET SECURITY\nCLEARANCE, WHILE THEY'RE ALSO DOING THE BUSINESS SIDE OF\nTHINGS, THIS IS GOING TO CHANGE ITSELF OUT PROPERLY.\nWE'RE ON DAY FIVE OR SIX RIGHT NOW.\nTHERE'S A LOT OF REAL ESTATE IN FRONT OF US BEFORE IT BECOMES\nPRESIDENT TRUMP. >> PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID CERTAIN\nASPECTS OF DONALD TRUMP'S TEMPERAMENT WILL NOT SERVE HIM\nWELL AND COULD IMPACT MARKETS, NATIONAL SECURITY.\nDO YOU THINK DONALD TRUMP UNDERSTANDS THE GRAVITY OF BEING\nPRESIDENT AND THAT IT'S DIFFERENT FROM CAMPAIGNING?\n>> I THINK HE DOES. THE DAY -- HERE'S WHAT STRUCK ME\nIN A BIG WAY. SO NOT ONLY JUST THE DAY AFTER\nTHE ELECTION AND THE NIGHT WHEN HE CAME OUT AND GAVE HIS VICTORY\nSPEECH, WHICH WAS VERY HUMBLE. AND HILLARY CLINTON'S WAS VERY\nGOOD TOO, BY THE WAY. AND WHEN HE MET WITH PRESIDENT\nOBAMA IN THE OVAL OFFICE, IT SEEMS LIKE SOMEBODY THAT'S\nREALLY KIND OF TAKING THE WEIGHT OF THE PRESIDENCY ON.\nIT'S ONE THING TO CAMPAIGN, AS A CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE, OF\nCOURSE IT'S NOT EVEN A FRACTION OF WHAT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT\nIS. WHEN YOU RUN AND YOU WIN, ALL OF\nA SUDDEN YOU WAKE UP THE NEXT DAY AND YOU REALIZE I'VE GOT TO\nBE A CONGRESSMAN NOW. AND I THINK YOU'RE SEEING THAT\nWITH DONALD TRUMP, IS THIS REALIZATION THAT, CAMPAIGNING IS\nFUN, IT'S ONE THING, NOW HE'S GOING TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE\nUNITED STATES, AND HE'S GOT A BIG COUNTRY TO LEAD.\nAGAIN, LET'S SEE HOW THIS SHAKES ITSELF OUT.\nAS PRESIDENT OBAMA ELOQUENTLY SAID TODAY, AND I THINK HE\nUNDERSTANDS FIRST HAND, THERE IS A LEARNING CURVE ASSOCIATED, AND\nGIVE PRESIDENT TRUMP A CHANCE. >> THE PRESIDENT INDICATED THAT\nTHE PRESIDENCY IN HIS WORDS, HAS A WAY OF WAKING YOU UP.\nDO YOU THINK DONALD TRUMP IS BECOMING MORE MODERATE ALREADY\nSINCE THE ELECTION, MORE REALISTIC NOW THAT HE'S BEEN\nELECTED PRESIDENT? >> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT MODERATE\nOR WHATEVER. I THINK HE'S COMING TO\nUNDERSTAND THAT, OKAY, AGAIN, NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE EXPECTED\nDONALD TRUMP TO WIN. I THINK THERE WERE PROBABLY A\nLOT IN THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION THAT WERE SURPRISED BY HIS\nVICTORY. ALL OF A SUDDEN THE NEXT DAY YOU\nWEAK UP AND SAY NOT ONLY DO I HAVE NATIONAL DEFENSE ISSUES TO\nDEAL WITH, PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE AT STAKE, BUT I ALSO HAVE TO START\nTHINKING ABOUT BUILDING A LEGACY AND WHAT IS ACTUALLY ACHIEVABLE\nIN A POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT. YES, THE REPUBLICANS HAVE ALL\nLEVERS OF GOVERNMENT FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT FEW YEARS, BUT WE\nDON'T HAVE 60 VOTES IN THE U.S. SENATE.\nSO HOW DO YOU BUILD THIS? HE'S ALWAYS CLAIMED THAT HE'S A\nDEAL MAKER, HE CAN ACCOMPLISH THINGS.\nIT LOOKS LIKE HE'S THINKING THAT WAY NOW.\nSO GIVE HIM AN OPPORTUNITY. >> PRESIDENT OBAMA SAYS HE\nTHINKS DONALD TRUMP IS PRAGMATIC, NOT IDEALOGICAL.\nYOU DIDN'T SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP DURING THE CAMPAIGN.\nDO YOU THINK HE IS PRAGMATIC OPPOSED TO BEING IDEALOGICAL?\n>> I HOPE HE IS PRAGMATICALLY IDEALOGICAL.\nI HOPE HE COMES WITH AN IDEOLOGY, BUT A PRAGMATISM TO\nSAY THERE'S A LESSON TO LEARN AND THE REPUBLICANS IN 2004 THAT\nTURNED AROUND AND LOST IN '06 AND PRESIDENT OBAMA THAT WON IN\n'08, TO TURN AROUND AND LOSE IT IN 2010, WHICH IS YOU HAVE TO\nACCOMPLISH YOUR PRIORITIES. OBAMACARE WILL BE A BIG ISSUE\nAND EVERYTHING ELSE. BUT THERE'S ALSO SPACE TO REACH\nOUT TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE AND SAY, LET'S TRY TO FIND\nAREAS WE CAN WORK TOGETHER. THAT'S THE PRAGMATISM PART OF\nTHE IDEOLOGY. AN INFRASTRUCTURE BILL WITH TAX\nREFORM OR WHATEVER THAT LOOKS LIKE.\nAN OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE DEMOCRATS TO A BUY-IN.\nJUST BECAUSE THEY LOST POWER OUT HERE DOESN'T MEAN THEY HAVE TO\nLOSE ALL INFLUENCE. SO IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR\nEVERYBODY TO COME TOGETHER, I THINK.\n>> DONALD TRUMP APPOINTED -- NAMED HIS CAMPAIGN CEO STEVE\nBANNON AS A TOP ADVISER IN THE WHITE HOUSE.\nSOME WHITE SUPREMISTS TODAY CALLING THE MOVE EXCELLENT.\nSOME CONSERVATIVES VERY CRITICAL, SAYING HE REPRESENTS\nAN EXTREME RIGHT, ALMOST RACIST, FASCIST POSITION.\nTHOSE ARE HARSH WORDS INDEED. WHERE DO YOU SEE IT?\n>> WELL, JUST LIKE PRESIDENT OBAMA, WHO BASICALLY DECIDED HE\nWASN'T GOING TO COMMENT ON IT, I THINK RIGHT NOW LET'S LET THIS\nALL SHAKE OUT. THERE'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN SOME\nTHINGS THAT HAVE BEEN ON THE WEBSITE THAT I CONDEMN WHOLE\nHEARTEDLY. BUT I DON'T KNOW STEVE BANNON, I\nDON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HIM EXCEPT HE'S ASSOCIATED TH\nSO LET'S PLAY IT BY EAR. IF WE SEE THINGS, OF COURSE,\nEVERY MEMBER OF COURSE AND EVERY PARTY LEADER WILL BE UP IN ARMS\nAND SAY THING IS INAPPROPRIATE. BUT RIGHT NOW, PRESIDENT-ELECT\nTRUMP IS PUTTING TOGETHER HIS INNER CIRCLE AND I'M GIVING HIM\nSPACE, JUST LIKE I DID IN 2012 FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA.\n>> CONGRESSMAN, WE'RE GETTING NEW INFORMATION.\nPRESIDENT PUTIN TODAY CALLED PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP.\nTHEY HAD A SERIOUS PHONE CONVERSATION.\nWE'RE GETTING SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THAT CONVERSATION, AND THE\nFUTURE OF U.S.-RUSSIA RELATIONS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1479170731804.1479166500086.41ed010c-ba06-4166-8ecd-3d5147b8934b.segment0.thumb.jpg", "channel": "202"}, {"start": 388583.0, "length": 319037.0, "end": 707620, "date": 1479168322167, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1479171224675.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1479168308501-8cf4ae9f-8c4e-498b-b9e2-be8cdc4c7717-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=388.58,707.62", "text": ">>> MORE BREAKING NEWS.\nNEW QUESTIONS TONIGHT ABOUT WHAT ROLE DONALD TRUMP'S ADULT\nCHILDREN WILL PLAY IN HIS WHITE HOUSE.\nWE'RE DIGGING INTO REPORTS OF SOME INFIGHTING WITHIN THE TRUMP\nTRANSITION TEAM. JIM SCIUTTO, WHAT ARE YOU\nHEARING ABOUT THE INFIGHTING WHEN IT COMES TO THE INCOMING\nNATIONAL SECURITY TEAM? >> WE'RE SPEAKING TO MULTIPLE\nSOURCES INVOLVED IN THE TRANSITION AND HEARING OF SHARP\nDISAGREEMENTS OVER KEY APPOINTMENTS AND GENERAL\nDIRECTION OF THE ADMINISTRATION. IT'S BEEN DESCRIBED BY ONE\nPERSON CONNECTED TO THE TRANSITION AS A KNIFE FIGHT.\nI'VE HEARD MORE COLORFUL LANGUAGE USED TO DESCRIBE THOSE\nDISAGREEMENTS. IN GENERAL, THE DIVISION BEING\nBETWEEN MORE TRADITIONAL CONSERVATIVES, PARTY OPERATIVES\nSUCH AS REINCE PRIEBUS AND LESS TRADITIONAL FOLKS SUCH AS STEVE\nBANNON. BUT YOU HAVE THREE CHIEFS IN\nEFFECT IN THERE WITH REINCE PRIEBUS, STEVE BANNON, AND THE\nROLE OF JARED CUSHNER, WHO EXPECTED TO BE AN ADVISER.\nTHAT CONFUSION HAS BEEN DESCRIBED TO ME BY SOMEONE VERY\nCONNECTED TO THE TRANSITION AS BUFFOONERY, BECAUSE IT'S MAKING\nTHESE DECISIONS VERY DIFFICULT. AND ALSO YOU HAVE TWO VERY\nDIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW THAT ARE CLASHING OVER THINGS.\nONE EXAMPLE IS OVER THE SECRETARY OF STATE, BECAUSE YOU\nHAVE MANY MAIN STREAM CONSERVATIVES WHO ARE PUSHING\nFOR JOHN BOLTON, OF COURSE, YOU REMEMBER HIM, FORMER U.N.\nAMBASSADOR, PUSHING FOR HIM. AND THEN YOU HAVE OTHERS MORE\nTRUMP LOYALISTS PUSHING FOR SAY RUDY GIULIANI FOR THAT KEY POST.\nON OTHER KEY NATIONAL SECURITY POSTS, WE'RE HEARING OF GREATER\nAGREEMENT, JEFF SESSIONS AS A LEADING CONTENDER FOR SECRETARY\nOF DEFENSE. MICHAEL DEFENSE, LEADING\nCONTENDER FOR NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER.\nBUT SEVERAL OTHER KEY POSITIONS, SHARP DISAGREEMENT THERE.\n>> I'VE ALSO HEARD JEFF SESSIONS' NAME BEING MENTIONED\nFOR ATTORNEY GENERAL, AS WELL. JIM ACOSTA IS REPORTING THAT THE\nPRESIDENT-ELECT WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIS ADULT CHILDREN AND\nSON-IN-LAW GET TOP SECRET SECURITY CLEARANCES.\nWHAT ARE YOU HEARING ABOUT THAT? >> PEOPLE ARE INCREDULOUS.\nUSUALLY, TOP SECRET CLEARANCE IS DETERMINED BY VIRTUE OF THE JOB\nYOU ARE IN. AND SO AS FAR AS I CAN TELL, NO\nMEMBER OF THE FAMILY, HIS CHILDREN OR SON-IN-LAW, CAN HAVE\nJOBS INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE BECAUSE OF VERY STRONG NEPOTISM\nRULES. THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE PAID, SO\nJARED CUSHNER COULD BE AN INFORMAL OUTSIDE ADVISER.\nBUT I DON'T KNOW HOW AN INFORMAL OUTSIDE ADVISER GETS TOP SECRET\nCLEARANCE. WE WERE JUST TALKING BEFORE, A\nSPOUSE MAY GET THAT BY VIRTUE OF BEING THE SPOUSE, BECAUSE\nDOCUMENTS ARE IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND YOU COHABIT WITH THE\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. BUT THIS QUESTION OF WHETHER\nYOUR FAMILY, AND BY THE WAY, YOUR FAMILY WHO IS ALSO RUNNING\nYOUR EX BUSINESS, CAN GET THAT KIND OF CLEARANCE RAISES ALL\nKINDS OF QUESTIONS. >> IT'S A THOROUGH PROCESS.\nTHEY LOOK AT EVERY FOREIGN TRAVEL AND FOREIGN CONTACT,\nWHETHER YOU HAVE RELATIVES OVERSEAS.\nTHIS CAN TAKE MONTHS. >> LET ME BRING JEFFREY TOOBIN\nIN. DONALD TRUMP SAID IN THAT \"60\nMINUTES\" INTERVIEW, GAY MARRIAGE, SETTLED LAW, FORGET\nABOUT IT. IT'S GOING TO STAY THE LAW OF\nTHE LAND. BUT ON ROE VERSUS WADE, HE SAID\nHE WANTS TO APPOINT WHAT HE CALLS PRO-LIFE JUSTICES SO THAT\nTHE STATES WILL MAKE THOSE DECISIONS INSTEAD OF NATIONALLY.\nSO WHY IS ONE SETTLED LAW, ROE VERSUS WADE HAS BEEN THE LAW OF\nTHE LAND SINCE 1973. >> AND JUST REAFFIRMED BY THE\nSUPREME COURT IN JUNE, STRIKING DOWN PART OF TEXAS' ABORTION\nRESTRICTIONS. I THINK THE DIFFERENCE IS\nPOLITICAL. EVEN THE CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT\nHAS VERY QUICKLY COME TO TERMS WITH THE EXISTENCE OF SAME-SEX\nMARRIAGE. PEOPLE ARE NOT VERY EXERCISED\nABOUT IT ANYMORE. BUT ABORTION REMAINS THE MOST\nIMPORTANT ISSUE TO THE CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT IN THIS\nCOUNTRY. AND DONALD TRUMP, THOUGH NOT TOO\nLONG AGO DESCRIBED HIMSELF AS VERY PRO CHOICE, HAS VERY\nCLEARLY SAID HE'S GOING THE APPOINT JUSTICES WHO WILL -- WHO\nWILL BE OPPOSED TO ROE V. WADE, SAID IT\nDURING THE CAMPAIGN, SAID IS TO LESLIE STAHL IN THE INTERVIEW ON\n\"60 MINUTES.\" THERE ARE FIVE JUSTICES ON THE\nCOURT NOW WHO SUPPORT ROE V. WADE.\nTHE CURRENT VACANCY WILL NOT TURN CORNER BUT, YOU KNOW, THREE\nOF THE FIVE JUSTICES WILL SOON BE OVER 80, SO DONALD TRUMP MAY\nREALLY HAVE THE CHANCE TO DELIVER ON THE END OF ROE V.\nWADE. >> ALL RIGHT.\nEVERYBODY, STAND BY. NOW THAT THIS UNPRECEDENTED\nELECTION HAS BEEN DECIDED, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE HOW WELL WE\nGOT TO THIS HISTORIC MOMENT IN THE FIRST EVER BOOK FROM CNN\nPOLITICS. \"UNPRECEDENTED: THE ELECTION\nTHAT CHANGED EVERYTHING.\" SEE THE BOOK COVER RIGHT THERE,\nFILLED WITH BEHIND THE SCENES SECRETS, BEAUTIFUL PHOTOGRAPHY,\nFIRSTHAND REPORTING FROM THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\nTHE BOOK WILL BE IN STORES DECEMBER 6th.\nYOU CAN REORDER YOUR COPY TODAY.", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1479171313534.1479168308501.8cf4ae9f-8c4e-498b-b9e2-be8cdc4c7717.segment2.thumb.jpg", "channel": "202"}, {"start": 0, "length": 557487.0, "end": 557487, "date": 1479170123942, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1479173646020.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1479170110024-f0df7b17-a25f-4de0-8773-577b45d45d3d-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=0.00,557.49", "text": "OR WOMEN OR OTHERS THAT WERE\nCONCERNED ABOUT THE TENOR OF THE CAMPAIGN.\n>> Reporter: AND PRESIDENT OBAMA ENDED, HE ALSO TALKED,\nMENTIONED, STRUCK A HOPEFUL NOTE, I SHOULD SAY, IN TALKING\nABOUT HOW THE PRESIDENCY HAS A TENDENCY TO WAKE PEOPLE UP AND\nSORT OF INTRODUCE THEM TO REALITY THAT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT\nFROM HOW GOVERNING IS.

I THINK THAT IS FAIRLY OBVIOUS.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA, HIS TWO YOUNG CHILDREN OBVIOUSLY DID NOT NEED\nTHESE TYPES OF TOP SECRET SECURITY CLEARANCES.\nKEEP IN MIND, DONALD TRUMP'S ADULT CHILDREN, HIS SON-IN-LAW,\nJARED KUSHNER, ARE AMONG HIS TOP ADVISERS.\nWE SAW THIS DURING THE COURSE OF THE CAMPAIGN.\nYOU RECALL JUST LAST WEEK WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS MEETING WITH\nDONALD TRUMP IN THE OVAL OFFICE, JARED KUSHNER WAS TAKING A\nSTROLL WITH THE CURRENT CHIEF OF STAFF ON THE SOUTH LAWN OF THE\nWHITE HOUSE. I'M TOLD BY A TRANSITION SOURCE\nTHAT PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP, YES, HAS ASKED FOR TOP SECRET\nSECURITY CLEARANCES FOR HIS ADULT CHILDREN AND FOR HIS\nSON-IN-LAW, JARED KUSHNER. NOW, KEEP IN MIND, THERE ARE\nOTHER THINGS MOVING ALONG INSIDE THE TRUMP TRANSITION.\nALTHOUGH WE ARE HEARING THAT, AND WE REPORTED THIS LAST WEEK,\nERIN, THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME TENSIONS INSIDE THE TRANSITION\nTEAM. OBVIOUSLY, THERE ARE FACTIONS\nJOCKEYING FOR DIFFERENT POSITIONS, BUT AS ONE OF MY\nCOLLEAGUES, JIM SCIUTTO DESCRIBED IT, THERE'S A BIT OF A\nKNIFE FIGHT, AS HE PUT IT, GOING ON INSIDE THAT TRANSITION.\nHOWEVER, WE SHOULD POINT OUT THIS TEAM IS STARTING TO MAKE\nSOME PROGRESS TOWARD MAKING SOME PRETTY IMPORTANT DECISIONS.\nI'VE BEEN TOLD BY A TRANSITION SOURCE THAT BOTH THE FORMER NEW\nYORK MAYOR RUDY GIULIANI AND FORMER U.N. AMBASSADOR, JOHN\nB BOLTON UNDER GEORGE W. BUSH,\nTHEY'RE THE TWO TOP CON TTENDER FOR SECRETARY OF STATE.\nHEARING ABOUT TENSIONS GOING ON INSIDE THE TRANSITION,\nPOTENTIALLY SOME IN-FIGHTING, THEY ARE GETTING CLOSER TO VERY,\nVERY SIGNIFICANT DECISIONS.

JIM SCIUTTO IS REPORTING ON THE\nKNIFE FIGHT WHICH I'M GOING TO GET TO IN A MOMENT.\nWITH ME NOW, JEFFREY LORD WHO SUPPORTED DONALD TRUMP, AND\nFORMER CLINTON WHITE HOUSE AIDE, KEITH BOYKIN WHO SUPPORTED\nHILLARY CLINTON.

KNIFE FIGHTS.\nDESCRIBING IT AS A KNIFE FIGHT, IN FACT SAYING THE CONFUSION,\nLACK OF CLARITY OVER WHO'S IN CHARGE BETWEEN REINCE PRIEBUS,\nSTEVE BANNON AND TRUMP'S SON-IN-LAW, JARED KUSHNER IS\nBUFFOONERY. >> AS SOMEBODY WHO WORKED IN THE\nREAGAN ADMINISTRATION, WHAT RONALD REAGAN DID WAS APPOINT\nBAKER AS CHIEF OF STAFF, I.E., REINCE PRIEBUS FIGURE, WHO WAS\nVERY CONTROVERSIAL IN THE DAY AS COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT.\nHE WAS VERY CONSERVATIVE, VERY BANNON LIKE IN THAT SENSE.\nVIEWED BY THE REAGANS AS MANY PEOPLE SAID, AS A SON.\nIN OTHER WORDS, HE HAD THAT PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP AND WAS\nSORT OF IN CHARGE AMONG OTHERS THINGS WITH TRANSLATING RONALD\nAND NANCY REAGAN TO THE REST OF THE WHITE HOUSE STAFF.\n>> YOU MANAGED TO MAKE THE REAGAN ARGUMENT HERE, JEFFREY\nLORD, YOU ALWAYS FIND A WAY. >> JARED KUSHNER WOULD BE\nMICHAEL BEAVER. >> I -- HISTORIAN ALWAYS, REAGAN\nADMINISTRATION, LOOK, THIS IS DICHBT.\nWHAT HAVE WE SAID OVER AND OVER ABOUT THIS CAMPAIGN?\nIT'S UNPRECEDENTED. IT'S DIFFERENT.\nAND I THINK THIS TRANSITION IS VERY DIFFERENT AND I'M HEARING\nTHAT NOT ONLY WITHIN THE GROUP ARE THERE KNIFE FIGHTSS GOING O,\nBUT THERE'S TREMENDOUS PRESSURE COMING FROM OUTSIDE.\nYOU HAVE THE SENATE WHO HAS TO CONFIRM SOME PEOPLE WEIGHING IN\nAND LOBBYING. YOU HAVE THAT, OUR TERM,\nKUSHNER, THE GOP ESTABLISHMENT. NOT IN A BADPROFESSIONALS WHO HE\nBEEN AROUND A LONG TIME. A WORD I WOULDN'T SAY AFTER\nELECTION DAY, THEY WANT TO SEE DONALD TRUMP PIVOT FROM\nCANDIDATE TRUMP -- >> REALLY.\n>> -- TO PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP FINALLY.\nPUTTING THIS CABINET TOGETHER IS VERY IMPORTANT TO A LOT OF\nPEOPLE. >> ON THIS ISSUE, JEFF, OF\nSECURITY CLEARANCES BECAUSE THIS IS SIGNIFICANT AND RELATED,\nRIGHT, YOU HEAR ABOUT WHETHER IT'S A KNIFE FIGHT OR NOT, JARED\nKUSHNER BEING SO INVOLVED, SECURITY CLEARANCES FOR TRUMP'S\nADULT CHILDREN. HAVE WE SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS,\nJAMIE WAS SAYING YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE KENNEDYS TO SEE A\nFAMILY LIKE THIS. >> OF COURSE NOT, THEY DIDN'T\nHAVE SECURITY CLEARANCES. THE ONLY PERSON WHO WILL GET A\nSECURITY CLEARANCE IS IF THEY HAVE A JOB SPECIFIC THAT THEY\nWOULD ABSOLUTELY NEED THAT. SO WE HAVE TO, I THINK, HOLD ON\nJUST A SECOND, SEE WHAT JOBS THEY ACTUALLY GET, BUT ADULT\nCHILD IS NOT GOING TO SIMPLY HAVE A SECURITY CLEARANCE UNLESS\nTHEY HAVE A JOB THAT REQUIRES IT HERE.\nAND IF THEY'RE STILL RUNNING THE BUSINESS, THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER\nARGUMENT. >> WHICH WE ARE GOING TO HAVE\nBECAUSE THAT'S A REALLY SERIOUS CONVERSATION.\nDAVID GERGEN, YOU KNOW, WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA SPOKE TODAY, I\nTHINK YOU COULD BE FORGIVEN FOR BEING COMPLETELY SHOCKED.\nI MEAN, IT WAS NOT EVEN A WEEK AGO HE CALLED DONALD TRUMP UNFIT\nAND WOEFULLY UNPREPARED FOR THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT.\nAND TODAY, I MEAN, THIS IS ALMOST A RINGING ENDORSEMENT.\nHERE'S WHAT HE SAID. >> HE IS COMING TO THIS OFFICE\nWITH FEWER SET HARD AND FAST POLICY PRESCRIPTIONS THAN A LOT\nOF OTHER PRESIDENTS MIGHT BE ARRIVING WITH.\nI DON'T THINK HE IS IDEOLOGICAL. I THINK ULTIMATELY HE'S\nPRAGMATIC IN THAT WAY AND THAT CAN SERVE HIM WELL AS LONG AS\nHE'S GOT GOOD PEOPLE AROUND HIM AND HE HAS A CLEAR SENSE OF\nDIRECTION. >> THIS IS THE ARGUMENT THAT\nTRUMP SUPPORTERS WERE MAKING FOR OVER A YEAR, DAVID GERGEN, NOW\nCOMING FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nHE IS PRAGMATIC AND NOT IDEOLOGICAL.\n>> WELL, I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS TRYING VERY HARD TO BE\nHOPEFUL. TO BE RESPECTFUL.\nTO FOLLOW HILLARY CLINTON'S ADVICE WHICH WAS AFTER ALL, KEEP\nAN OPEN MIND AND WISH HIM THE BEST AS HE GETS STARTED.\nAT THE SAME TIME AS YOU WOULD WELL RECOGNIZE, HE OCCASIONALLY\nNEEDLED HIM A LITTLE BIT. YOU KNOW, HE NEEDLED HIM ON THE\nQUESTION OF HIS TEMPERAMENT AND NEEDLED HIM ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE\nOF SPEAKING OUT AND SENDING SIGNALS OF UNITY AND NEEDLED\nHIM, TOO, ABOUT THE ISSUE OF REMEMBERING BEING RESPECTFUL OF\nNORMS. I THINK THE SENDING OUT THE\nSIGNAL OF UNITY IS MOST IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW IN THE\nDOMESTIC CONTEXT. I WAS ALSO TAKEN, ERIN, BY THE\nFACT THAT THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO EUROPE AND HE'S GOING TO BE\nREASSURING OUR ALLIES THERE, OUR FRIENDS THERE, THAT DONALD TRUMP\nIS STILL COMMITTED TO NATO, COMMITTED TO THE TRANS-ATLANTIC\nPARTNERSHIP. THAT'S IMPORTANT.\nTHERE'S A LOT OF UNREST AS YOU KNOW IN EUROPE AND EUROPEAN\nCAPITALS OVER THAT VERY QUESTION.\nI THOUGHT THAT WAS HELPFUL. >> YES.\n>> I WANT TO SAY ONE LAST THING ABOUT JARED KUSHNER, IF HE TAKES\nA FULL-TIME JOB IN THE WHITE HOUSE, SECURITY CLEARANCE, NO\nBRAINER, OF COURSE HE CAN GET A SECURITY CLEARANCE.\nIF HE'S ON THE OUTSIDE, I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY PRECEDENT FOR A\nMEMBER OF THE FAMILY TO HAVE SECURITY CLEARANCE ON THE\nOUTSIDE. ONE WOULD HAVE TO CHECK THAT.\nI THINK IT'S MUCH MORE UNLIKELY FOR THE THREE CHILDREN.\nTHE PRESIDENT COULD POTENTIALLY APPOINT ONE OF THEM TO, SAY,\nSOMETHING LIKE THE DEFENSE ADVISORY BOARD.\nTHAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A GOOD FIT FOR JARED KUSHNER, BUT IF\nYOU'RE A MEMBER OF THAT BOARD, AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN, YOU CAN\nGET SECURITY CLEARANCE. >> RIGHT.\nTHAT WAS, IF I RECALL, AN ISSUE FOR HILLARY CLINTON DONOR AT ONE\nPOINT. KEITH BOYKIN, LET ME --\n>> YES, EXACTLY. >> WHEN YOU HEAR THE PRESIDENT\nCOME OUT AND SAY HE'S COMING WITH FEWER HARD AND SET POLICY,\nHE'S PRAGMATIC AND NOT IDEOLOGICAL, IS THE PRESIDENT\nSAYING GIVE HIM A SECOND CHANCE ON WHATEVER HE SAID ABOUT\nIMMIGRANTS, WHATEVER HE SAID ABOUT MUSLIMS, WHATEVER HE SAID\nABOUT NATO? BY THE WAY, THE PRESIDENT SAID\nDONALD TRUMP SUPPORTS NATO, SPEAKING FOR DONALD TRUMP.\n>> YEAH. I DON'T THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT\nWAS COMPLIMENTING HIM WHEN HE SAID THAT HE WAS NOT\nIDEOLOGICAL. I FELT HE WAS STATING SORT OF A\nFACT ABOUT WHERE WE ARE. I MEAN, WE'VE ELECTED THIS MAN\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT\nHIS VIEWS ARE, DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS BELIEFS ARE, DON'T KNOW WHAT\nPOLICY ACTIONS HE WOULD TAKE. I THINK THE PRESIDENT WAS TRYING\nTO ACT WITH CLASS AND DIGNITY TODAY.\nI FELT HE WANTED TO SET AN EXAMPLE FOR DONALD TRUMP WHO ON\nTHE OTHER HAND HAS BEEN TWEETING THE LAST WEEK COMPLAINING ABOUT\nTHE \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" COMPLAINING ABOUT PROTESTERS,\nCALLING THEM UNFAIR. HE'S SETTING A STANDARD AND\nEXAMPLE FOR THE TYPE OF BEHAVIOR A PRESIDENT SHOULD EXHIBIT.\n>> ALL RIGHT.", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1479173648301.1479170110024.f0df7b17-a25f-4de0-8773-577b45d45d3d.segment0.thumb.jpg", "channel": "202"}, {"start": 569366, "length": 11812.0, "end": 581178, "date": 1479170123942, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1479173646020.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1479170110024-f0df7b17-a25f-4de0-8773-577b45d45d3d-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=569.37,581.18", "text": ">>> PLUS, MR.

HE JOINS US NOW FROM OUTSIDE\nTRUMP TOWER IN NEW YORK. SO THESE SECURITY CLEARANCES, I\nMEAN, HOW UNPRECEDENTED IS THIS? >> WELL, OBVIOUSLY, IT'S\nSOMETHING, ANDERSON, WE HAVEN'T SEEN IN A VERY LONG TIME.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA'S TWO YOUNG CHILDREN, WERE NOT IN POSITION\nTO RECEIVE THESE TYPES OF SECURITY CLEARANCES.\nAND WHAT WE DO UNDERSTAND AT THIS POINT IS THAT THE TRUMP\nTRANSITION IS LOOKING INTO THIS, ALTHOUGH WE SHOULD POINT OUT,\nANDERSON, ONE TRUMP TRANSITION SOURCE IS PUSHING BACK ON THIS,\nSOMEWHAT, SAYING THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS NOT MADE THE OFFICIAL\nASK FOR HIS CHILDREN TO HAVE THESE TOP-SECRET SECURITY\nCLEARANCES. BUT IT WOULD NOT BE UNUSUAL,\nGIVEN HOW THESE ADULT CHILDREN OF DONALD TRUMP HAVE BEEN CLOSE\nADVISERS THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE CAMPAIGN, HIS SON-IN-LAW, JARED\nKUSHNER, MIGHT NOT BE IN LINE ANYMORE TO BE WHITE HOUSE CHIEF\nOF STAFF, ALTHOUGH THAT WAS ONE OF THOSE RUMBLINGS OUT THERE,\nPRIOR TO REINCE PRIEBUS, GETTING THAT POSITION.\nBUT JARED KUSHNER IS GOING TO BE A VERY CRITICAL INFORMAL ADVISER\nTO THE FUTURE PRESIDENT. AND SO, IT'S NOT OUT OF THE\nORDINARY THAT JARED KUSHNER WOULD HAVE THIS KIND OF\nINFORMATION. NOW, OBVIOUSLY, QUESTIONS ARE\nGOING TO BE RAISED AND THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN RAISED, BECAUSE\nDONALD TRUMP'S ADULT CHILDREN ARE GOING TO HAVE SOME VERY\nIMPORTANT POSITIONS RUNNING HIS BUSINESS EMPIRE.\nTHE QUESTIONS ARE GOING TO BE RAISED UP ON CAPITOL HILL, OF\nCOURSE, WHETHER OR NOT THERE MIGHT BE SOME POTENTIAL\nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST BETWEEN BEING IN CHARGE OF THAT BUSINESS\nEMPIRE AND HAVING THAT KIND OF NATIONAL SECURITY CLEARANCES,\nANDERSON. ALL OF THIS GETTING SORTED OUT.\nBUT AT THIS POINT, I TALKED TO A KEY TRANSITION SOURCE EARLIER\nTHIS EVENING, WHO SAYS, YES, THE TRANSITION IS LOOKING TO THIS AT\nTHIS MOMENT. ANDERSON?\n>> RIGHT, BECAUSE IN PAST YEARS, A PRESIDENT WOULD PUT BUSINESSES\nOR INVESTMENTS IN A BLIND TRUST RUN BY SOMEBODY ELSE, AND DONALD\nTRUMP ISN'T PLANNING TO DO THAT. HE'S PLANNING THE TO HAVE THE\nTHREE GROWN KIDS RUNNING THE BUSINESS EMPIRE.\nTHE IDEA THAT THEY WOULD ALSO BE ADVISING HIM ON NATIONAL\nSECURITY, THAT DOES RAISE A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER ISSUES.\nCAN YOU EXPLAIN JUST THE DETAILS OF A TOP-SECRET -- ASSUMING IT'S\nA TOP-SECRET CLEARANCE -- WHAT KIND OF ACCESS IT GIVES YOU?\n>> Reporter: WHAT I THINK WE SHOULD POINT OUT, THOUGH, IS\nTHAT I DON'T THINK THE ADULT CHILDREN, PERHAPS, SAY, JARED\nKUSHNER, WHO WOULD BE A VERY IMPORTANT ADVISER INSIDE THIS\nWHITE HOUSE, WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE KIND OF OPERATIONAL\nSECURITY INFORMATION THAT YOU WOULD HAVE INSIDE \"THE SITUATION\nROOM,\" INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE, FOR EXAMPLE.\nAND SO THE WAY IT'S BEEN EXPLAINED TO ME, ANDERSON, IS\nTHAT IF THESE ADULT CHILDREN OF DONALD TRUMP ARE IN A SITUATION\nWHERE, PERHAPS, SOME KIND OF SENSITIVE MATERIAL MIGHT BE\nUSEFUL TO THEM, AS PART OF THEIR ADVISING CAPACITY WITH DONALD\nTRUMP, THEIR FATHER, BEING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,\nTHEN PERHAPS THAT INFORMATION MIGHT GET PASSED ALONG TO THEM.\nBUT I DON'T THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE KIND OF VERY SENSITIVE\nINFORMATION THAT WOULD BE HANDLED AT THE TOP NATIONAL\nSECURITY LEVELS, YOU KNOW, LOCATIONS FOR COUNTERTERRORISM\nOPERATIONS AND THAT SORT OF THING.\nBUT ANDERSON, IT SOUNDS LIKE FROM WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM OUR\nOURS INSIDE THE TRANSITION, THIS IS AT THE VERY BEGINNING STAGE\nOF THIS PROCESS. NOT ANYWHERE NEAR THE END.\n>> JIM ACOSTA, THANKS. THE BREAKING NEWS COMES A\nBACKDROP OF CONTROVERSY BECAUSE OF ONE DONALD TRUMP'S WHITE\nHOUSE APPOINTMENTS, NOT REINCE PRIEBUS, BUT PERHAPS TRUMP'S\nCLOSEST POLITICAL ADVISER. MORE ON THAT FROM OUR SARA\nMURRAY. >> Reporter: DONALD TRUMP IS\nALREADY SPARKING OUTRAGE AS HE BUILDS A WHITE HOUSE TEAM WITH\nAN ALT-RIGHT EDGE. >> OUR WORK ON THIS MOVEMENT IS\nREALLY JUST BEGINNING. >> Reporter: THE PRESIDENT-ELECT\nNAMING STEPHEN BANNON, CAMPAIGN CEO AND EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF\nBREITBART NEWS AS HIS CHIEF STRATEGIST AND SENIOR COUNSELOR.\nAND TAPPING REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN, REINCE\nPRIEBUS, AS HIS CHIEF OF STAFF. AS PRIEBUS ARGUES, TRUMP WANTS\nTO BE PRESIDENT FOR ALL. >> IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT\nALL AMERICANS UNDERSTAND THAT HE IS A PRESIDENT FOR EVERYONE.\nHE WANTS TO MAKE EVERYONE PROUD. WHETHER OF YOUR RACE, ETHNIC\nBACKGROUND, GENDER, ANYTHING. >> Reporter: THE BANNON HIRE\nINSTANTLY GREW CRITICISM FROM HATE WATCH GROUPS, WHO HAVE\nNOTED BANNON'S EMBRACE OF THE ALT-RIGHT MOVEMENT, MADE UP OF\nCONSERVATIVES, POPULISTS, WHITE SUPREMACISTS, AND ANTI-SEMITES.\nTHE SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER SAYING TRUMP SHOULD RESCIND THIS\nHIRE.

AND SO, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW\nHOW MANY TIMES WE HAVE TO RELEARN THIS LESSON BECAUSE WE\nENDED UP HAVING 43% OF THE COUNTRY NOT VOTING WHO WERE\nELIGIBLE TO VOTE, BUT IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE.\n>> SO ELECTIONS MATTER, THAT'S A MESSAGE, THAT SORT OF THEME HE\nREPEATED MORE THAN ONCE. SO, DON, WE SAW A VERY DIFFERENT\nTONE FROM THE PRESIDENT TODAY IN THIS PRESS CONFERENCE THAN WE'VE\nSEEN OVER THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS OR LONGER OF HIM BEING ON THE\nCAMPAIGN TRAIL, THROWING BARBS AT DONALD TRUMP AND SOMETIMES\nSPEAKING IN APOCK LIP TICK TERMS ABOUT A TRUMP PRESIDENT.\nTODAY HE WAS CALM, SPOKE CAREFULLY AND WAS MEASURED AND\nAT TIMES IT SEEMED AS IF HE WAS SENDING A MESSAGE HOW A\nPRESIDENT SHOULD SPEAK, SHOULD CARRY HIMSELF.\nIT WAS AN INTERESTING PRESS CONFERENCE.\n>> HOW A PRESIDENT SHOULD CONDUCT HIMSELF.\nI APPRECIATE THAT. I WANT TO BRING IN \"WASHINGTON\nPOST\" POLITICAL REPORTER. GOOD EVENING, GENTLEMEN.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME TONIGHT.\nRYAN, I'M GOING TO START WITH YOU.\nTHERE'S WORD TODAY DONALD TRUMP WANTS HIS CHILDREN AND\nSON-IN-LAW TO BE GIVEN TOP SECURITY, SECRET SECURITY\nCLEARANCES. A TRANSITION OFFICIAL DENIES\nTHAT AND SAYS THE CHILDREN HAVEN'T FILLED OUT THE\nPAPERWORK, BUT DOES THAT CONCERN YOU?\n>> YEAH, I THINK IT IS DEEPLY CONCERNING BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN\nTOLD TWO THINGS NOW ABOUT WHAT DONALD TRUMP'S CHILDREN, OR AT\nLEAST THREE OF HIS CHILDREN WILL BE DOING DURING THE TRUMP\nPRESIDENCY. WE WERE TOLD DURING THE CAMPAIGN\nTHAT THEY WOULD BE RUNNING HIS BUSINESS AND THAT WOULD BE HOW\nTHE TRUMP FAMILY WOULD SOMEHOW SEPARATE DONALD TRUMP'S BUSINESS\nEMPIRE, WHICH HE SAYS IS WORTH $10 MILLION, FROM HIS GOVERNMENT\nSERVICE. NOW, LET ME TELL YOU, ANY OF\nDONALD TRUMP'S COMPETITORS AROUND THE WORLD WOULD BE VERY\nHAPPY IF THEY HAD ACCESS TO TOP SECRET INFORMATION FROM THE U.S.\nGOVERNMENT. SO THE IDEA THAT HIS CHILDREN\nWILL BE LEARNING ABOUT OUR GOVERNMENT'S SECRETS AT THE SAME\nTIME THAT THEY ARE RUNNING A MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR GLOBAL\nBUSINESS IS THE KIND OF THING THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT TO SEE IN\nA THIRD WORLD BANANA REPUBLIC, NOT IN THE UNITED STATES OF\nAMERICA. SO, AGAIN, THIS ISSUE OF THE\nCONFLICT BETWEEN HIS COMPANIES AND THE CORPORATE WORLD AND OUR\nGOVERNMENT HAS NOT BEEN SETTLED AT THE LEAST, AND THIS IS SORT\nOF THE LATEST WORRYING SIGN. JUST TO ADD ONE DETAIL, IVANKA\nTRUMP'S BUSINESS HAS TONIGHT TWEETED OUT AN ADVERTISEMENT FOR\nA $10,000 BRACELET THAT IVANKA WAS APPARENTLY WEARING ON \"60\nMINUTES\" AND IS USING HER APPEARANCE ON \"60 MINUTES\" TO\nSELL JEWELRY. SO THIS IS COMPLETELY NEW IN\nAMERICAN LIFE. WE HAVE NEVER HAD A PRESIDENTIAL\nFAMILY THAT A WEEK AFTER THE ELECTION IS TRYING TO PROFIT OFF\nOF THEIR FATHER'S WINNING THE PRESIDENCY.\n>> ALTHOUGH I THINK IT IS WORTH POINTING OUT IVANKA TRUMP ALSO\nDID IT AFTER THE CONVENTION. SHE HAD A DRESS SHE WORE AT THE\nCONVENTION AND HER ADVERTISER SENT IT OUT AS WELL.\n>> YEAH, AND I WOULD MAKE A DISTINCTION.\nTHERE'S THINGS THAT YOU DO PERHAPS WHEN YOU'RE RUNNING FOR\nPRESIDENT THAT REALLY CHANGE ONCE YOUR FATHER ASCENDS TO THE\nOFFICE. I MEAN PEOPLE WERE OUTRAGED WHEN\nTHE BUSH BROTHERS CASHED IN ON THE BUSH PRESIDENCY OR WHEN, YOU\nKNOW, BILLIE CARTER DID SOMETHING EMBARRASSING TO JIMMIE\nCARTER, BUT IN IS A MUCH DIFFERENT AND MORE WORRYING\nLEVEL. >> YOU WERE SHAKING YOUR HEAD IN\nAGREEMENT WITH WHAT HE WAS SAYING.\nDO YOU THINK HIS BUSINESS COMPETITORS WOULD LIKE TO KNOW,\nYOU KNOW, WHAT -- >> YEAH, I MEAN CATEGORICALLY.\nRYAN IS EXACTLY RIGHT. THE THING THAT IS INTERESTING IS\nDONALD TRUMP HAS A LOT OF CONFIDENCE AND FAITH IN HIS\nKIDS. THEY'RE CLOSE TO HIM IN\nBUSINESS, OUTSIDE OF BUSINESS. WE'VE SEEN THEM ON THE CAMPAIGN\nTRAIL. I THINK THIS IS THE LIMITED\nCIRCLE THAT HE HAS THAT HE PUTS CONFIDENCE AND TRUST IN.\nIF YOU LOOK AT THE TRANSITION TEAM, THE TRANSITION TEAM\nMEMBERS ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN WITH HIM SINCE DAY ONE.\nHE HAS NOT DEMONSTRATED AN ABILITY TO EXPAND OUTWARD AND HE\nHAS A TON OF POSITIONS TO FILL AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND IN THE\nEXECUTIVE BRANCH, AND IT SEEMS HE HAS A FAIRLY SMALL POOL OF\nPEOPLE HE TRUSTS. >> CAN YOU PLAY THIS OUT\nLOGICALLY FOR ME. IF DONALD TRUMP GETS INFORMATION\nON FIGHTING ISIS OR, YOU KNOW, CAMPAIGN AGAINST IRAQ, SYRIA AND\nALL OF THAT STUFF, WOULD HIS CHILDREN, DON JR. AND IVANKA,\nGET THAT INFORMATION AS WELL? WOULD THEY BE WEIGHING IN ON\nGIVING HIM FOREIGN POLICY ADVICE?\n>> IF THEY HAVE THE HIGHEST LEVEL SECURITY CLEARANCE, HE CAN\nTALK TO THEM ABOUT ANYTHING, RIGHT.\nGIVING THEM ACCESS TO -- YOU KNOW, ESSENTIALLY IT IS A PASS\nCODE. THEY CAN GO WHEREVER THEY WANT\nWITH IT, GET WHATEVER INFORMATION, HAVE CONVERSATIONS\nWITH THE PRESIDENT AT WHATEVER LEVEL THE PRESIDENT DEEMS\nAPPROPRIATE. >> I MEAN, DON, THERE ARE SENIOR\nPEOPLE IN THE WHITE HOUSE THAT DON'T HAVE TOP-LEVEL SECURITY\nCLEARANCES. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S\nJUST HANDED OUT TO EVERYONE WHO WALKS INTO AN ADMINISTRATION.\n>> YEAH. BUT HE HAS SAID REPEATEDLY\nDURING THE CAMPAIGN THAT HE WOULD SURROUND HIMSELF, RYAN,\nWITH THE BEST PEOPLE. HIS CHILDREN HAVE NO EXPERIENCE\nWITH POLICY OR GOVERNMENT. I MEAN IS IT DANGEROUS\nPOTENTIALLY TO NATIONAL SECURITY?\n>> IF HIS CHILDREN ARE GOING TO BE HIS NATIONAL SECURITY\nADVISORS? YEAH, THAT'S INSANE.\nBUT THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN -- I MEAN, LOOK, HE WAS ELECTED\nPARTLY BECAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE, RIGHT?\nTHIS WAS A REVOLT AGAINST PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE, PEOPLE WHO\nHAVE BEEN RUNNING THINGS FOR A WHILE.\nSO WE SHOULDN'T BE SHOCKED THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU KNOW, HE'S\nRELYING ON PEOPLE WITHOUT EXPERIENCE.\nBUT, YEAH, WE SHOULD BE CONCERNED.\nI MEAN THE IDEA THAT HIS KIDS SHOULD BE -- SHOULD BE GIVEN --\nI MEAN I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE WE'RE HERE DISCUSSING THIS, DON.\nHIS CHILDREN ARE GOING TO GET -- AND I SHOULD SAY THAT IN THE\nPOOL REPORT, I DID JUST SEE THAT A TRUMP ADVISER WENT DOWN TO THE\nREPORTERS THAT ARE HANGING OUT DOWNSTAIRS AT TRUMP TOWER AND\nTRIED TO PUT THIS FIRE OUT AND DID SAY ON BACKGROUND THAT TRUMP\nHAS NOT ASKED FOR THIS AND THAT AS OF RIGHT NOW THIS IS NOT A\nSTANDING REQUEST. >> YEAH.\n>> SO WE'LL SEE IF THIS GOES FORWARD OR NOT.\n>> ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN.\nI APPRECIATE IT. >> THANKS.\n>> STRAIGHT AHEAD, DONALD TRUMP'S ECONOMIC PLANS TO CREATE\nJOBS AND CUT TAXES. WILL IT WORK?\nWILL IT ALL WORK?

I SPOKE TO ONE OF HER BEST\nFRIENDS, MICHELLE NORRIS, AS WE'RE HEARTBROKEN BY THIS NEWS.\nSHE REMEMBERS GWEN AS A GIANT IN THE NEWS INDUSTRY, MODERATED TWO\nVICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES OVER THE YEARS.\nAN ICON OF THE JOURNALISM WORLD AND SOMEONE WHO WAS GOING TO BE\nRECEIVING A PRESTIGIOUS JOURNALISM PRIZE, JOHN\nCHANCELLOR AWARD AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY TWO DAYS AWAY.\nSHE PASSED AWAY AT AGE 61. >> SHE'S BROKEN GENDER BARRIERS,\nRACE BARRIERS IN THIS WONDERFUL CAREER OF JOURNALISM.\nI HAVE A NUMBER OF VOICES, I HAVE JAMIE, NIA-MALIKA, GLORIA\nHERE ALL TO CELEBRATE HER LIFE. NIA, TO YOU FIRST, SHE WAS A\nROLE MODEL, WASN'T SHE? >> SHE WAS.\nI LOVED GWEN. I WAS A CUB REPORTER AT THE\nBALTIMORE SUN. I HAD A LITTLE PICTURE OF GWEN\nIFILL ON MY COMPUTER THAT I PRINTED OUT AND PASTED ON MY\nCOMPUTER BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE GWEN IFILL.\nSHE HAD WORKED AT \"THE WASHINGTON POST,\" SHE HAD DONE\nTELEVISION, WORKED AT \"THE NEW YORK TIMES.\"\nSHE WAS SOMEONE I COULD LOOK ON TV AND SEE MYSELF.\nSHE WAS WARM, SHE WAS SMART, SHE WAS FUNNY UP.\nREAD HER BIOGRAPHY AND YOU TALK ABOUT COVERING SEVEN\nPRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS. BUT SHE WAS ALWAYS HERSELF.\nSHE WAS ALWAYS SO RELATABLE ON AIR.\nSO, I GOT TO SPEND A GOOD BIT OF TIME WITH HER.\nI TOLD HER ABOUT THIS LITTLE PICTURE THAT I HAD ON MY\nCOMPUTER. >> WHAT DID SHE SAY?\n>> SHE SAID, THAT'S SWEET BUT A LITTLE CREEPY.\nTHAT'S HOW SHE WAS. I MEAN, SHE WAS INCREDIBLY FUNNY\nAND GREAT AND WARM. MY GOODNESS, SUCH A ROLE MODEL\nFOR ME AND FOR SO MANY PEOPLE. SHE WAS LOVED BY ALL SIDES,\nRIGHT? I MEAN, SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE\nFIGURES THAT CROSSED ALL SORTS OF BARRIERS IN TERMS OF\nPOLITICS, IN TERMS OF -- JUST IN TERMS OF WHO YOU CAN BE IN THIS\nBUSINESS AND SUCH A LEADING LIGHT FOR SO MANY PEOPLE.\nMY GOODNESS, IT'S SO SAD. EVERY YEAR SHE WOULD HAVE THIS\nPARTY AT HER HOUSE. AND EVERYONE IN WASHINGTON WOULD\nPILE INTO HER HOUSE FOR NEW YEAR'S, NEW YEAR'S EVE.\nTHAT WAS THE PLACE EVERYBODY WENT TO.\nIT WAS SUCH A GENEROUS AND WARM PLACE TO BE AND REALLY A SYMBOL\nOF WHO SHE WAS AND BROUGHT EVERYONE TOGETHER.\nEVERYONE KNEW HER THROUGH ALL GENERATIONS OF JOURNALISM.\n>> KNEW HER, WANTED TO KNOW HER. JAMIE, YOU OVERLAPPED WITH HER\nIN YOUR CAREERS. YOU SHARED AN OFFICE SPACE, YOU\nLUCKY WOMAN WITH HER. WHAT WAS THAT LIKE?\n>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, LIKE NIA, WE ALL LOVED HER.\nSHE WAS A GREAT PERSON. SHE WAS FUNNY.\nAS YOU HEARD FROM THAT STORY SAYING, A LITTLE CREEPY.\nTHAT IS CLASSIC GWEN. SHE WAS SO DOWN TO EARTH.\nBUT SHE WAS ALSO, I THINK, A ROLE MODEL FOR EVERY REPORTER IN\nTHAT SHE WAS FEARLESS. SHE WAS SMART.\nSHE WAS FEARLESS. SHE WOULD STAND UP TO EVERYONE.\nSHE KNEW WHAT HER CORE WAS. AND THAT IS --\n>> EVERYTHING. >> -- EVERYTHING.\nAND SO WE ALL JUST LOVED HER, RESPECTED HER.\nTHIS IS -- THIS IS A REAL LOSS FOR ALL OF US.\n>> THE FACT THAT SHE KEPT HER BATTLE SO PRIVATE.\n>> RIGHT. AND SHE REALLY DID, BECAUSE\nTHOSE OF US WHO WERE FRIENDS KNEW IT WAS GOING ON, BUT WHEN I\nE-MAILED HER, SHE REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO GO INTO ANY DETAIL.\nSHE KEPT IT VERY QUIET. I WAS STUNNED BY TODAY'S NEWS.\nI DID NOT KNOW IT HAD GOTTEN THIS FAR.\nSO, SHE REALLY DID WANT IT KEPT VERY, VERY PRIVATE.\n>> GLORIA, WE KNOW HER AND LOVE HER FROM BEING ON PBS WITH JUDY\nWOODRUFF, BUT BEFORE THAT, AND NIA HIT ON THIS, ALL THE\nCAMPAIGNS SHE'S COVERED, THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES SHE\nHAD THE HONOR OF MODERATING. I THINK SHE WAS A CO-MODERATOR\nFOR THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY THIS LAST GO AROUND.\nTALK TO ME ABOUT HOW BIG OF A DEAL THAT WAS FOR HER AND FOR\nWOMEN AND FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN THIS CAREER.\n>> FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO SAY THIS IS HARD FOR ME BECAUSE\nSHE'S A REALLY GOOD FRIEND. AND I THINK WE'RE ALL DIMINISHED\nWITHOUT GWEN. AND HER PREPARATION FOR THOSE\nDEBATES WAS STUNNING. AND SHE DID IT WITH A SENSE OF\nHUMOR, AS SHE DID EVERYTHING ELSE.\nAND AS SHE BATTLED HER CANCER, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, SHE WAS\nAMAZING. YOU KNOW, I HAD LUNCH WITH HER\nAND SHE WANTED TO KEEP IT QUIET. AND SHE WAS JUST READY TO GET\nBACK TO WORK AND DO WHAT SHE LOVES DOING.\nAND I JUST -- THE WORLD WON'T BE THE SAME FOR ME.\n>> I LOVE ALL OF US LADIES ALL TALKING ABOUT HER.\nAND I WISH -- I HAD NEVER MET HER PERSONALLY.\nI CALLED SOMEONE OUT ON MY SHOW THIS PAST YEAR AND SHE TWEETED\nAT ME, YOU GO GIRL. I WANTED TO FRAME THE TWEET.\nI MEAN, IT'S GWEN IFILL. >> CAN I SAY ONE THING?\nGWEN WAS ONE OF THE FIRST GIRLS ON THE BUS IN THE GENERATION.\nYOU KNOW, WE WERE GIRLS ON THE BUS TOGETHER.\nAND WHEN IT WAS LARGELY MALE. WE HAD FUN MAKING FUN OF THE\nGUYS ON THE BUS. FOR THE NEXT 20 YEARS IT NEVER\nSTOPPED. THAT'S THE WAY SHE WAS.\n>> FOR ME, THE BIGGEST DEAL FOR ME IN TERMS OF MY LIFE WAS BEING\nON WASHINGTON WEEK. I FELT LIKE I HAD MADE IT.\nONCE I WAS ON \"WASHINGTON WEEK,\" AND THIS WAS YEARS INTO MY\nCAREER. I HAD BEEN ON OTHER TELEVISION\nOUTLETS BUT TO BE AT THAT TABLE WITH THE GWEN IFILL, SOMEONE I\nHAD LOOKED UP TO AND TO HAVE HER ACKNOWLEDGE ME AND GIVE ME A\nPLACE AT THAT TABLE, THAT WAS SOMETHING FOR ME.\n>> TELL ME MORE STORIES. NIA, TELL ME MORE STORIES.\n>> GLORIA, DO YOU WANT TO GO? >> WELL, YOU KNOW, SO GWEN AND I\nSTARTED OUT AT THE GIRLS ON \"WASHINGTON WEEK\" BECAUSE, YOU\nKNOW, THERE WERE A LOT OF THESE AGUST MALE REPORTERS, RICK SMITH\nOF \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" AND HAYNES JOHNSON OF \"THE\nWASHINGTON POST\" AND PAUL DUKE WAS THE MODERATOR.\nAND IT WAS JUST AT A TIME WHEN THEY WERE SORT OF LETTING WOMEN\nREPORTERS ACTUALLY BE ON THIS SHOW.\nAND GWEN AND I ALWAYS HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH IT BECAUSE WHEN WE\nWOULD SIT ACROSS THE TABLE FROM ONE PERSON IN PARTICULAR, WHOSE\nNAME I WILL NOT MENTION, HE USED TO WINK AT US BEFORE THE SHOW\nSTARTED. >> OH, PLEASE.\n>> AND GWEN AND I WOULD LOOK AT EACH OTHER, DID YOU GET THAT\nWINK? YEAH, I GOT THAT WINK.\nDID YOU GET THAT WINK? AND THEN, OF COURSE, IT WAS SO\nWONDERFUL WHEN GWEN BECAME THE HOST OF \"WASHINGTON WEEK,\" IT\nWAS REALLY AN IMPORTANT MOMENT FOR THAT SHOW AND TO RECOGNIZE\nGWEN AS THE PERSON WHO WOULD TAKE IT OVER AND DO SUCH A\nWONDERFUL JOB WITH IT. TAKING THE SHOW ON THE ROAD,\nWHICH SHE DID, DURING ELECTION YEARS AND BRINGING HERSELF INTO\nTHAT SHOW, WHICH I THINK MADE FOR ITS LONGEVITY OVER THESE\nYEARS. >> NIA, IF I MAY, I WANT TO\nBRING ONE MORE VOICE IN, MICHELLE NORRIS IS ON THE PHONE.\nMICHELLE IS A CLOSE, CLOSE, CLOSE FRIEND OF GWEN'S AND A\nCOLLEAGUE. SO, MICHELLE, THANK YOU SO MUCH\nFOR CALLING IN. THERE'S BEEN LAUGHTER, THERE'S\nBEEN TEARS IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MINUTES.\nMY SINCERIST CONDOLENCES TO YOU FOR LOSING SUCH A NEAR AND DEAR\nFRIEND. HOW ARE YOU DOING?\nMICHELLE, ARE YOU WITH ME? IT'S BROOKE.\nWE'RE LIVE ON CNN. WE LOST HER.\nHOPEFULLY WE'LL GET HER BACK. LISTENING TO ALL THESE STORIES\nAND, JAMIE, JUMP IN. DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER ONE?\n>> SO, THERE ARE TWO THINGS I JUST WANT TO TELL PEOPLE ABOUT\nHER. SHE CAME FROM NEW YORK.\nSHE WENT TO SIMMONS COLLEGE. SHE CAME FROM A LARGE FAMILY.\nTHAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO HER. HER FATHER WAS A MINISTER, AN\nAME MINISTER. BUT GWEN HAD A VERY BIG CAREER\nBEFORE SHE CAME TO TV. I KNEW HER IN THE LATE '90s WHEN\nWE SHARED AN OFFICE AT NBC. BUT SHE WAS A NEWSPAPER\nREPORTER. SHE WORKED AT THE BALTIMORE SUN,\nSHE WORKED AT \"THE NEW YORK TIMES.\"\nAND SHE BROUGHT THOSE REPORTING SKILLS WITH HER.\nTO WATCH HER PREPARE FOR AN INTERVIEW --\n>> GLORIA WAS SAYING THE DEBATE --\n>> TO WATCH HER WHEN SHE DID THE DEBATE WITH FORMER VICE\nPRESIDENT DICK CHENEY AND JON EDWARDS, SHE READ EVERYTHING.\nSHE DID EVERYTHING. SHE WAS METICULOUS.\nSHE WAS A ROLE MODEL AS A PERSON AND AS A FRIEND, BUT HER\nREPORTING WAS JUST IMPECCABLE. >> JAMIE AND NIA AND GLORIA,\nJUST THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH.

HE'S GREAT AT MARKETING AND\nBRANDING AND IF ANYONE CAN SORT OF CONVINCE AMERICANS THAT HEY,\nWE'RE GETTING A WALL EVEN IF IT'S NOT A LITERAL WALL, IT'S\nDONALD TRUMP.

LET'S LISTEN IN TO PRESIDENT\nOBAMA AND THE GREEK PRESIDENT. >> Translator: I WANTED TO TELL\nTHE AMERICAN PRESIDENT, PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA, VERY\nWARMLY FOR VISITING GREECE, FOR CHOOSING ATHENS, THE BIRTH PLACE\nOF DEMOCRACY FOR ONE OF HIS LAST STOPS BEFORE CONCLUDING HIS\nEIGHT-YEAR TERM AS THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT.\nTHE PRESIDENCY DURING WHICH THE INFLUENCE OF THE UNITED STATES\nOF AMERICA AROUND THE WORLD HAS CHANGED, EVEN IN THIS COUNTRY\nWHERE DURING THE COLD WAR ERA GREEK/AMERICAN RELATIONS WERE --\nHAVE ACCUMULATED HEAVY HISTORIC BURDEN -- A VERY HEAVY\nHISTORICAL BURDEN. I THINK THAT IT WAS A HISTORICAL\nMOMENT WHEN DURING THE PREVIOUS VISIT OF AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT\nIN GREECE IN 1999 PRESIDENT CLINTON RECOGNIZED THE ERRORS OF\nTHE U.S. AS REGARDS TO THE DICTATORSHIP IN GREECE BECAUSE\nTHE AMERICANS -- THE GREEK PEOPLE NOT ONLY RELATE TO THE\nANCIENT TRADITIONS, THEY HAVE FOUGHT, THEY HAVE SHED BLOOD\nUNTIL RECENTLY TO DEFEND THE VALUES OF DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM,\nWHICH ARE OUR COMMON VALUES. THEREFORE, GREECE IS NOW\nWELCOMING AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT WHO THROUGHOUT HIS TERM IN\nOFFICE HAS STRONGLY DEFENDED THESE VALUES, WHO HAS FOUGHT FOR\nTHE RIGHTS OF ALL PEOPLE IRRESPECTIVE OF COLOR, RELIGION,\nOR SEXUAL ORIENTATION, WHO HAS WORKED IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH\nCLIMATE CHANGE, A PRESIDENT WHO HAS INTEGRATED MILLIONS OF\nAMERICANS INTO HEALTH CARE, A PRESIDENT WHO HAS PUT HIS\nSTRENGTH AND HIS INFLUENCE BEHIND A HUMANITARIAN SOLUTION\nOF THE GREAT REFUGEE CRISIS, THE GREATEST AFTER WORLD WAR II.\nAND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT BECAUSE THIS IS VERY\nIMPORTANT TO GREECE. THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO WHEN HE\nHAD TO DEAL WITH THE 2008 ECONOMIC CRISIS HAS LED THE\nAMERICAN ECONOMY ON A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PATH FROM THE ONE THAT\nEUROPE HAS CHOSEN EIGHT YEARS LATER.\nTHE RESULT IS MORE THAN VISIBLE. QUANTITATIVE EASING, COMMITMENT\nTO EMPLOYMENT WHICH WAS THE CHOICE OF THE UNITED STATES HAVE\nLED TO IMPRESSED GROWTH RATES AND DECLINING UNEMPLOYMENT.\nWHILE ON THE OTHER SIDE THE INSISTENCE OF EUROPEAN LEADERS\nTHROUGH AUSTERITY POLICIES KEEPS THE EUROPEAN ECONOMY STRAPPED\nSTAGNATION AND IT, THEREFORE, BRINGS ABOUT HUGE POLITICAL AND\nSOCIAL PROBLEMS AND IT IS IN THIS RESPECT THAT I HAVE THE\nOPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA THE HUGE\nCHALLENGES THAT OUR COUNTRY BUT ALSO THE WHOLE OF EUROPE IS\nDEALING WITH. THESE ARE CHALLENGES THAT NEED\nTO BE DEALT WITH COLLECTIVELY, DECISIVELY, AND EFFECTIVELY,\nOTHERWISE, WE WILL BE LED TO -- BACKWARDS.\nWE ARE HOPEFUL THAT IT'S THE ONLY DECLINE AGAINST THE\nINCREASING TREND IN SKEPTICISM AND INWARD LOOKING WHICH IS A\nTHREAT. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WHEN\nTRYING TO AVOID HISTORIC MISTAKES OF THE PAST IN 1953 AND\nWITH THE ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\nTHEY SETTLED THE GERMAN DEBT AND TO A GROWTH CLAUSE.\nWITH THE MOST -- THE HASHEST.  AS AN ECONOMY AND AS A SOCIETY\nWE HAVE HAD TO EXPERIENCE A PROGRAM OF DISASTROUS AUSTERITY\nWHICH MADE THE PROBLEMS MORE ACUTE INSTEAD OF RESOLVING THEM.\nWITHIN A FEW YEARS WE HAVE LOST 25% OF OUR GDP WHILE IN 2004\nUNEMPLOYMENT WENT UP TO 27%. TODAY AND DESPITE THAT WE HAVE\nSUFFERED, WE ARE STILL STANDING. WE WERE ABLE THROUGH GREAT\nSACRIFICES TO AVOID THE THREATS AND THREATENED DISASTER AND WE\nARE STEP BY STEP RESTORING OUR ECONOMY.\nTODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS WE ARE BACK TO GROWTH,\nSLOWLY BUT SURELY WE ARE DECREASING UNEMPLOYMENT AND WE\nARE RESTORING CONFIDENCE TO THE FUTURE OF THE GREEK ECONOMY.\nABOUT 18 MONTHS AGO ALTHOUGH WE WERE A YOUNG GOVERNMENT WE WERE\nASKED TO TAKE VERY DIFFICULT DECISIONS AND WITH THIS\nOPPORTUNITY I WANT TO RECOGNIZE PUBLICLY THE ROLE AND THE\nCONTRIBUTION OF PRESIDENT OBAMA DURING THOSE DIFFICULT MOMENTS\nTO RECOGNIZE HIS MORAL AND POLITICAL SUPPORT HE GAVE TO MY\nGOVERNMENT IN THE EFFORT TO FIND A POLITICAL SOLUTION.\nDIFFICULT DECISIONS WERE MADE, NOT ONLY IN ORDER TO KEEP OUR\nCOUNTRY IN THE EUROZONE BUT ALSO IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE\nCOHESION OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. AND I BELIEVE THAT OUR DECISIONS\nWERE RIGHT AS SHOWN BY HISTORY. WE HAVE MADE DIFFICULT REFORMS\nIN THE SOCIAL SECURITY, IN TAXATION, IN PUBLIC\nADMINISTRATION, BUT I HAVE -- WE HAVE ALWAYS TAKEN MEASURES TO\nFIGHT CORRUPTION, TO ATTRACT INVESTMENT, TO CREATE A BETTER\nCONTEXT FOR INVESTMENT IN GREECE.\nWE WILL CONTINUE TO DECISIVELY PROMOTE REFORMS THAT WILL\nPROMOTE GROWTH AND AT THE SAME TIME WE WILL CONTINUE TO\nNEGOTIATE HARD IN ORDER TO AVOID ANY REFORMS THAT WOULD UNDERMINE\nGROWTH, BUT WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT TO ALL OF US IS THAT\nSOCIETY SHOULD UNDERSTAND -- SHOULD FEEL THE RESULTS OF ALL\nOF THAT AND TO MAKE THE BURDEN TO THE WEAK MEMBERS OF SOCIETY\nLIGHTER AND ALSO FOR THE YOUNGER AND PRODUCTIVE GENERATION\nBECAUSE AFTER SEVEN YEARS PEOPLE CANNOT TAKE ANYMORE AUSTERITY.\nTHE IMPORTANT REDUCTION OF THE GREEK DEBT, THE REDUCTION OF THE\nSURPLUSES WHICH ARE EXPECTED OF US IN THE FUTURE AND THE\nPARTICIPATION OF THE BANK OF GREECE IN THE QUANTITATIVE\nEASING PROGRAM ARE RIGHTFULLY -- SHOULD BE RIGHTFULLY GIVEN TO\nGREECE AND THE TIME TO DO THAT IS NOW.\nAND FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW, I THINK THAT IT IS NOT ONLY\nSYMBOLIC BUT IT IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT THAT BARACK OBAMA IS\nNOW IN ATHENS AND THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW WILL BE IN BERLIN AT\nTHIS VERY CRITICAL POINT IN TIME WHEN DECISIONS ARE EXPECTED.\nDECISIONS THAT NOT ONLY CONCERN GREECE, THEY CONCERN EUROPE AND,\nTHEREFORE, THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. COOPERATION AND SOLIDARITY ARE\nNECESSARY REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER TO BRING ABOUT THE SOLUTIONS\nTHAT WILL ONCE AGAIN BRING STABILITY TO THE EUROPEAN\nINTEGRATION AND BRING IT BACK TO THE TRACKF GROWTH.\nAND IN RELATION TO THAT, PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I DISCUSSED\nA NUMBER OF IMPORTANT THINGS, SUCH AS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE\nIMPORTANT POTENTIAL FOR INVESTMENTS IN GREECE, IN A\nSERIES OF SECTORS SUCH AS ENERGY, TOURISM, RESEARCH AND\nTECHNOLOGY. WE ALSO DISCUSSED THE FUTURE\nWHERE GREECE WITH ITS IMPORTANT SHIPPING POWER CAN BECOME AN\nIMPORTANT TRANSIT CENTER FOR TRADE, TRANSPORT AND ENERGY\nLINKING EUROPE TO ASIA AND TO NORTH AFRICA.\nWE ALSO DISCUSSED IMPORTANT PROJECTS UNDERWAY WHICH UPGRADE\nTHE ROLE OF OUR COUNTRY IN THE -- ON THE ENERGY MAP, SUCH\nAS THE T.A.P., THE I.G.P., THE UPGRADING OF THE L&G TERMINAL\nAND THE FSRU PLANT IN LUXEMBOURG WHICH IS BEING DESIGNED.\nALSO WE DISCUSSED THE POSSIBILITY OF OPENING NEW\nNATURAL GAS CORRIDORS IN THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN WHICH\nWOULD PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PEACE AND STABILITY IN OUR\nREGION. WE HAVE ALSO DISCUSSED THE\nEXCELLENT GREEK HUMAN POTENTIAL, HUMAN CAPITAL, AND ESPECIALLY\nYOUNG SCIENTISTS. WE HAVE STRESSED THE HUGE\nPOTENTIAL OPENING FROM -- FOR THE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE\nAMERICAN AND THE GREEK BUSINESS COMMUNITIES IN THE FIELDS OF\nINNOVATION AND STARTUP COMPANIES IN GREECE.\nAND WE HAVE ALSO DISCUSSED THE CURRENT REGIONAL DEVELOPMENTS,\nTHE GREAT CHALLENGES IN SECURITY, MIGRATION, THE NEED TO\nSTRENGTHEN OUR COOPERATION ON THESE ISSUES.\nWE HAVE DISCUSSED THE CRITICAL ROLE", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1479223560641.1479220364040.3854d549-b23e-47f4-a6d6-6ae5c0b59e97.segment3.thumb.jpg", "channel": "202"}], "channel": "202"}, {"videos": [{"start": 1056625.0, "length": 96329.0, "end": 1152954, "date": 1479153835961, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1479156545535.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1479153822596-fa01b2f7-a991-4917-a1d0-179155693d95-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=1056.62,1152.95", "text": "WHAT HE HEIGHT EXPECT TO HEAR\nTHE PRESIDENT EMPHASIZE.ARE A O POST\" TO TALK SIMILARLY ABOUT\nWHAT HE HEIGHT EXPECT TO HEAR THE PRESIDENT EMPHASIZE.\nI DON'T KNOW IF YOU WERE ABLE TO HEAR, BUT THE WHOLE RANGE OF\nTOPICS, APPOINTMENT OF MR.

IF WE TAKE JOEL WITH HIS\nEXPERIENCE, AND SAY, OKAY, JOEL, MAYBE HE'S NOT ANY OF THOSE\nTHINGS, THE AUDIENCE THAT YOU ARE CATERING TO ARE THOSE\nTHINGS, YOU'RE DELIBERATELY PLAYING TO THE WORST\nDEVISIVENESS, THE WORST PREJUDICE, THE WORST RACIAL\nDIVIDES TO EITHER GET TRAFFIC OR MOTIVATE PEOPLE TO SUPPORT YOU,\nAND I THINK THAT'S DESPICABLE. >> IS THIS SIMPLY BEING TOO\nCUTE, YOU'RE AN ASIAN-AMERICAN, HE'S A JEWISH-AMERICAN?\n>> JUST BECAUSE YOU TREAT ONE PERSON WHO HAPPENS TO BE\nASSOCIATED WITH A PARTICULAR GENDER, RACE, OR RELIGION,\nDOESN'T MEAN THAT'S HOW YOU TREAT EVERYBODY.\n>> THE NEW YORK TIMES HAS A NEW INTERVIEW WITH BANNON TONIGHT.\nTHEY SAY HE REJECTED WHAT HE CALLED\nETHNO-NATIONALIST TENDENCIES OF SOME IN THE MOVEMENT.\nIT HAS TO DO WITH CURBING WHAT HE SEES AS THE CORROSIVE\nEFFECTS OF GLOBALIZATION AND HE BELIEVES HIS ENEMIES ARE\nMISSTATING HIS VIEWS AND THOSE OF MANY TRUMP FOLLOWERS.\nTHESE PEOPLE ARE PATRIOTS, THEY LOVE THEIR COUNTRY, THEY JUST\nWANT THEIR COUNTRY TAKEN CARE OF, HE ADDED, IT'S NOT THAT SOME\nPEOPLE ON THE MARGINS AS IN ANY MOVEMENT AREN'T THE BAD GUYS,\nRACIST ANTI-SEMITES, BUT THAT'S IRRELEVANT.\nWHAT'S YOUR REACTION? >> BANNON IS SOMEONE WHO'S\nCALLED BREITBART A PLATFORM FOR THE ALT-RIGHT MOVEMENT.\nHE CANNOT DIVORCE HIMSELF FROM THAT STATEMENT.\nIF THAT WASN'T THE CASE, I THINK WE'D BE HAVING A DIFFERENT\nDISCUSSION. HE CAN SAY WHAT HE WANTS NOW,\nBUT THE FACT IS THE KKK AND AMERICAN NAZI PARTY ARE ALL\nCELEBRATING HIS APPOINTMENT. HE SAID TRUTHFULLY THAT\nBREITBART WAS A PLATFORM FOR THE ALL THE RIGHT MOVEMENT.\nTHE ALT-RIGHT MOVEMENT IS A WHITE SUPREMACIST MOVEMENT THAT\nINVOLVES RACISM. IT IS WHAT IT IS.\nIF YOU'RE THE PRESIDENT-ELECT, IT'S -- YOU KNOW, IT SHOULD BE\nHIGH ON YOUR LIST OF PRIORITIES TO UNITE THE COUNTRY ESPECIALLY\nAFTER SUCH A DIVISIVE CAMPAIGN.

WHEN IN REALITY\nONE OF THE FIRST THINGS TRUMP DID WAS TWEETS OUT SOMETHING\nTHAT WAS FALSE ABOUT THE NEW YORK TIMES.\nWASN'T TRUE. MADE UP NUMBERS ABOUT\nCIRCULATION.

THE REAL QUESTION IS, WHAT ARE\nTHE IDEAS IN A OUR LEADERS ADVANCE.\nAND OUR LEADERS NOW ARE ADVANCING IDEAS AT LEAST WITH\nTHE APPOINTMENT OF STEVE BANNON WHO ADVANCED THE IDEAS OF THE\nALT-RIGHT AS A PART OF BREITBART ARE ADVANCING IDEAS WHICH ARE\nDESTRUCTIVE.

ONE THING IS VERY CLEAR, STEVE\nBANNON HAS ADVANCED IDEAS OF THE ALT RIGHT, HE KNOWS HIS BUSINESS\nHAS BEEN SETTING UP OR FURTHERING A PLATFORM FOR THEIR\nIDEAS, AND DONALD TRUMP HAS GOT TO REPUDIATE THAT, AND IT'S NOT\nPOSSIBLE TO DO THAT, IF STEVE BANNON'S YOUR CHIEF STRATEGIST.\n>> AND ALSO, I REALIZE THAT BY DOING THAT, HE MAY HAVE\nNORMALIZED THE ALT-RIGHT IN SOME WAY.\nNORMALIZED WHITE NATIONALISM, WHICH SHOULD NOT BE NORMALIZED.\n>> ABSOLUTELY. >> JOEL, EARLIER WE SPOKE ABOUT\nTHE ARTICLE ON BREITBART.COM, AN ESTABLISHMENT CONSERVATIVE'S\nGUIDE TO THE ALT-RIGHT.

THERE IS, OF COURSE, A LOT OF\nOPPOSITION FOR EXACTLY THAT REASON.\nLET'S BRING IN SOMEONE WHO KNOWS STEVE BANNON AND WHO FORMALLY\nREPRESENTED BREITBART NEWS BEFORE CUTTING TIES WITH THE\nORGANIZATION EARLIER THIS YEAR, PRESIDENT AND CEO OF ENDEAVOR\nSTRATEGIES JOINS US NOW. GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK ON THE\nSHOW. >> THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON.\n>> WHY SHOULD WE BE SO CONCERNED?\nWHY ISN'T THIS JUST, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE BRINGING IN SOMEBODY\nWHO'S NOT FROM THE MAINSTREAM, HE'S NOT IN THE CLUB AND ALL THE\nMEDIA AND INSIDERS GET UPSET THAT SOMEONE'S IN THERE THAT\nYO, YOU KNOW, ISN'T SOMEONE WE\nREALLY KNOW. IS THAT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?\nOR DO YOU BELIEVE BANNON REPRESENTS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS\nTO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY? >> I THINK THIS IS REALLY\nUNPRECEDENTED, UNCHARTED TERRITORY.\nTHIS ISN'T WHAT YOU NORMALLY SEE IN ADMINISTRATIONS, IN TURNOVERS\nWHERE THEY BRING IN SOMEBODY THAT MAY HAVE A LITTLE BIT\nDIFFERENT EXPERIENCE THAN WHAT WE SEE IN WASHINGTON.\nTHIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S COMPLETELY OUTSIDE THE NORMAL\nSITUATION. AND I THINK THAT'S WHY IT HAS SO\nMANY PEOPLE CONCERNED. IT IS AN UNPREDICTABLE VARIABLE.\nIT'S AN UNPREDICTABLE VARIABLE THAT HAS THE EAR OF THE\nPRESIDENT, WHO'S THE VIRTUAL CO-WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF.\nNOBODY KNOWS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.\n>> SO YOU WORKED THERE AS AN ADVISER.\nYOU'RE A PR GUY, A STRATEGIST OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO GET MESSAGING\nACROSS. WHAT DID YOU DETECT IN YOUR TIME\nWORKING WITH THEM WHERE YOU WERE LIKE, THIS IS A CONCERN, I DON'T\nWANT TO BE AROUND THIS? >> WELL, THE WAY BREITBART\nOPERATES AND THE WAY STEVE OPERATES, THEY'RE PROVOCATEURS.\nTHEY'RE ABOUT CREATING CONFLICT. WHEN YOU'RE IN THE ROLE OF BEING\nSOMEONE WHO HELPS THE PRESIDENT RUN THE COUNTRY, THAT'S NOT THE\nMENTALITY YOU SHOULD HAVE. IT SHOULD BE MUCH MORE RESERVED\nAND DIPLOMATIC AND MATURE. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE PAGES OF\nBREITBART, THE LAST WORD THAT COMES TO MIND IS MATURE.\n>> IS IT JUST ABOUT TACTICS, OR IS IT ABOUT INTENTION AND WHAT\nHE BELIEVES? WHAT DOES STEVE BANNON BELIEVE\nTHAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT?\n>> I THINK IT'S THE OVERALL WORLD VIEW THAT THE UNITED\nSTATES SHOULD BE MORE OF AN ISOLATIONIST COUNTRY, THAT WE\nSHOULD HAVE LESS PARTNERS, WE SHOULD BE DOING LESS IN THE\nGLOBAL COMMUNITY, WITHDRAW AND GO BACKWARDS.\nWHAT HAD SO MANY AMERICANS CONCERNED ABOUT THIS ELECTION\nPARTICULARLY IS THE IDEA THAT THE MESSAGE OF WE NEED TO GO\nBACK TO THE WAY IT WAS AND UNDO WHAT MANY WOULD CALL PROGRESS IN\nOUR COUNTRY, THAT HAS A LOT OF PEOPLE VERY SCARED AND CONCERNED\nABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS FOR THEM. >> DO YOU BELIEVE THIS IDEOLOGY\nINCLUDES FEELING THAT MULTICULTURALISM, RESPECTING\nMINORITY RIGHTS IS A PROBLEM? >> I THINK THE LAST THING YOU\nTHINK OF WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND STEVE BANNON IS\nTHE WORD RESPECT. THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO VERY FREELY\nAND OPENLY ATTACK ANYBODY WHO MIGHT DISAGREE WITH THEM, WHO\nATTACK THE FREE PRESS, WHO ATTACK STANDING PILLARS OF OUR\nINSTITUTION, OF OUR DEMOCRACY AND WANT TO CHANGE THAT.\nTHAT HAS A LOT OF, RIGHTFULLY SO, VERY CONCERNED.\n>> SO THIS GUY JARED TAYLOR, WHO RUNS THE SITE AMERICAN\nRENAISSANCE, A WHITE NATIONALIST SITE.\nTHIS ISN'T THE KKK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.\nTHESE ARE PEOPLE WITH ILLEGITIMATE OR LEGITIMATE\nGRIEVANCES. THERE HAS BEEN SOME WAFFLING ON\nSOME CANDIDATE TRUMP'S SIGNATURE ISSUES.\nBUILD A WALL, LOOKING AT MUSLIM IMMIGRANTS.\nI SUSPECT ONE OF STEVE BANNON'S IMPORTANT POSITIONS WILL BE AN\nANTI-WAFFLER. SOME CAN SAY, GOOD, HE PROMISED\nIT, HE SHOULD DO IT. THAT'S A TOUGH SPOT FOR TRUMP,\nRIGHT. BECAUSE HE DID TALK THIS TALK.\nWHAT DO YOU SEE IN THIS? WHY SHOULD THAT BE A CONCERN FOR\nPEOPLE? >> ONE, TRUMP SET HIMSELF UP TO\nBE HELD TO A STANDARD HE SET DURING THE CAMPAIGN.\nIT'S GOING TO BE HIS WORDS AND HIS RHETORIC HE'S MEASURED BY,\nBY HIS OWN SUPPORTERS, BY THE MOST PASSIONATE ALT-RIGHT\nSUPPORT HE HAS. I THINK STEVE IS THERE TO ENSURE\nHE DOESN'T WAFFLE ON THESE THINGS.\nTHERE'S A DIFFERENCE IN SAYING SOMETHING IN THE BEGINNING,\nDELAYING A LITTLE BIT, AND TRYING TO GARNER SOME GOOD FAVOR\nWITH EVERYBODY ELSE BEFORE PURSUING THE AGENDA HE TALKED\nABOUT FOR SO LONG. I THINK HE'S GOING TO ULTIMATELY\nTRY TO DO THOSE THINGS. I THINK RIGHT NOW THIS IS ALL\nJUST POSTURING. >> DO YOU BELIEF THAT STEVE\nBANNON WOULD BE A FORCE TO OPPOSE THE RESPECTEDI RESPECTS\nFOR MINORITIES LIKE THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY?\n>> ABSOLUTELY. LOOK AT HOW ON THE PAGES OF\nBREITBART THEY TALK ABOUT THESE COMMUNITIES AND MINORITIES AND\nRELATIONS AND WOMEN AND THE ROLE OF WOMEN IN THIS COUNTRY.\nTHAT'S KIND OF A PLAYBOOK AT LEAST FOR THE TYPE OF RHETORIC\nTHAT THEY'RE COMFORTABLE WITH. ACTIONS ALWAYS START WITH WORDS\nAND TURN TO SOMETHING MUCH MORE SERIOUS, MUCH MORE SUBSTANTIVE.\nALL WE HAVE TO MEASURE BOTH THE INCOMING PRESIDENT AND STEVE BY\nARE THE WORDS FROM THE PAST AND THE STORIES WE READ ON THE SITE\nTHAT THEY DESCRIBE AS THEIR GO-TO PLACE FOR NEWS.\n>> LAST QUESTION MAY BE THE MOST RELEVANT ONE.\nIN YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH THIS MAN, STEVE BANNON, IS IT WHAT HE\nREALLY BELIEVES, OR IS THIS JUST WHAT HAS BEEN WORKING FOR HIM\nWITH THIS MEDIA PRODUCT OF BREITBART, YOU KNOW, THAT\nPASSION WITH A SMALL BASE OF PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THESE THINGS.\nIS IT HYPE AND BUSINESS, OR IS THIS WHO HE IS?\n>> I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH.\nONE OF THE REAL OBSERVATIONS IS IT'S HARD TO DISCERN WHERE\nBREITBART ENDS AND WHERE STEVE BANNON THE PERSON BEGINS.\nI'VE HEARD STORIES OF PEOPLE COMING OUT SAYING, WELL, HE'S\nTREATED ME VERY WELL, I'M JEWISH AND HE'S RESPECTED ME.\n>> NAVY OFFICER, WORKED AT GOLDMAN SACHS.\nHE'S DONE A LOT OF LEGITIMATE THINGS.\n>> HE'S DONE A LOT OF THINGS. I THINK THAT HOW YOU TREAT ONE\nINDIVIDUAL PERSON WHO MIGHT BE FROM A SPECIFIC SUBGROUP, THAT\nDOESN'T NECESSARILY SPEAK TO YOUR OVERALL WORLD VIEW EITHER.\nALL WE HAVE TO JUDGE BY ARE THE THINGS WE'VE SEEN PROMULGATED BY\nTHIS NEWS SITE. THAT'S WHAT HE'S BEING JUDGED\nBY. THAT'S PROBABLY APPROPRIATE\nGIVEN THE ROLE HE'S PLAYED THERE AT THE TOP OF THAT SITUATION.\n>> AND IT IS RIGHT TO PUT NEWS IN QUOTES WHEN TALKING ABOUT\nTHAT SITE.

THEY'LL BE RETURNING TODAY AND\nBACK TO WORK TOMORROW. BUT THIS IS THE KIND OF THING\nTHAT REALLY COULD UNSETTLE THE TRANSITION PHASE.\nIF THERE IS A LOT OF BACKLASH. AT THE SAME TIME, YOU'VE GOT\nREINCE PRIEBUS MAKING THAT VERY SWEEPING CHARACTER WITNESS\nASSESSMENT OF BANNON PAINTING HIM AS VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE\nCHARACTER THAT'S PORTRAYED THROUGH HIS OTHER WORK AT\nBREITBART AND SOME OF THE WORDS THAT HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH\nHIM AND POSITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH HIM AND THIS IS A WAY OF\nDONALD TRUMP REWARDING SOMEONE INFLUENTIAL IN HELPING RUN WHAT\nIS NOW LOOKED AT AS A SUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGN AND YET, WILL THAT\nCAUSE PROBLEMS FOR A NEW PRESIDENT TRUMP INSIDE THE WHITE\nHOUSE IF THERE IS A SENSE THAT THIS IS SOMEONE WHO WOULD NOT BE\nWORTHY OF THAT POSITION BASED ON SOME OF HIS VIEWS.\nIT'S GOING TO BE ARGUED IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION IN THE\nDAYS AND WEEKS TO COME.

TAMRON?\n>> THANK YOU SO MUCH. APPRECIATE IT THIS MORNING.\nNO SIGNS THAT THOSE ANTI-TRUMP PROTESTS ARE LETTING UP FOR FIVE\nSTRAIGHT DAYS NOW, WE'VE SEEN THEM HERE IN NEW YORK.\nRIGHT OUTSIDE OF TRUMP'S FRONT DOOR.\nWASHINGTON, DC ALSO SEEING PROTESTS.\nCHICAGO, PORTLAND, SAN FRANCISCO, AND MIAMI.\nMOST OF THEM PEACEFUL. ON \"60 MINUTES,\" TRUMP ASKED\nABOUT THE PROTESTERS AND HE SAID, QUOTE, IT'S ONLY BECAUSE\nTHEY DON'T KNOW ME. HE ALSO DENOUNCED THOSE WHO\nTARGETED MINORITIES WITH RACIAL SLURS AND PERSONAL THREATS IN\nHIS NAME. >> I AM SO SADDENED TO HEAR THAT\nAND I SAY STOP IT. IF IT HELPS.\nI WILL SAY THIS AND RIGHT TO THE CAMERA.\nSTOP IT. >> NBC'S BLAKE McCOY AND MANY CALLED ON THE\nPRESIDENT ELECT TO GIVE ONE OF THESE GRAND SPEECHES ABOUT THE\nSTATE OF RACE SIMILAR TO WHAT MAYBE WHAT WE HEARD FROM BARACK\nOBAMA GIVEN THE DIVISIVENESS OF THIS AND ARE THEY PLANNING MORE\nPROTESTS STILL? >> Reporter: PROTESTS CONTINUE\nTHROUGH THE WEEKEND, TAMRON. AND THEY FOCUSED AROUND TRUMP\nTOWER AS THEY HAVE IN NEW YORK AND TRUMP'S HOTEL IN DC.\nPOLICE KEPT THEM AWAY FROM THE TOWER ITSELF TO PREVENT\nDESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY BUT BEEN MARCHING BY THE THOUSANDS.\nI'VE BEEN COVERING THESE PROTESTS AND A MIX OF ANGER OVER\nTRUMP ELECTED AND FEAR OVER WHAT THIS ELECTION WILL MEAN TO THEM.\nTHE PEOPLE PROTESTING HERE ARE PROTESTING A WIDE RANGE OF\nISSUES. WE'VE SEEN PEOPLE PROTESTING HIS\nDECISION OR DESIRE, RATHER, TO OVERTURN ROE V. WADE AND\nIMMIGRANTS UPSET ABOUT DEPORTATION POLICIES AND THEN\nWE'VE SEEN GAYS PROTESTING ABOUT UNCERTAINTY OF WHAT A TRUMP\nPRESIDENCY WILL MEAN FOR THEM AND ABOUT THE HEALTH CARE LAW\nAND WHAT IT MEANS IF THEY HAVE PREEXISTING CONDITIONS.\nTHE TOPICS ARE WIDE RANGING. BUT PEACEFUL SO FAR IN MOST\nCITIES. IN PORTLAND, OREGON, ON\nSATURDAY, THEY DID FLARE UP QUITE A BIT.\nSOME OBJECTS THROWN AT POLICE. 71 PEOPLE ARRESTED.\nPOLICE IN PORTLAND ATTRIBUTE THAT TO A SMALL SUBSET OF\nPROTESTERS BUT THE ONLY THING WE'VE HEARD OF TODAY IS FROM LOS\nANGELES WHERE SOME SCHOOL WALKOUTS ARE BEING PLANNED.\nLAPD HAS WARNED ABOUT THAT. WHETHER WE'LL SEE MORE\nSPONTANEOUS PROTESTS REMAINS TO BE SEEN.\nI WANT TO POINT OUT THAT IT'S NOT JUST LARGE CITIES LIKE NEW\nYORK, L.A., CHICAGO THAT HAVE BEEN SEEING PROTESTS BUT IN ST.\nLOUIS, DAYTON, OHIO, SPRINGFIELD, MASSACHUSETTS.\nTHEY ARE WIDE RANGING ACROSS THE COUNTRY.\n>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LET ME BRING IN DAVID.\nMSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST. THANK YOU SO MUCH, OF COURSE,\nBUREAU CHIEF, MOTHER JONES AS WELL.\nAND DAVID, SO THIS \"60 MINUTES\" INTERVIEW.\nDO YOU BETTER UNDERSTAND DONALD TRUMP?\n>> I THINK WE HAD A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF DONALD TRUMP\nBEFORE HE WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT. WE'VE BEEN WATCHING HIM AND WHAT\nHE'S BEEN SAYING IN TERMS OF SOME HATEFUL BULLYING REMARKS.\nTHE \"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD\" TAPE SHOWED US DONALD TRUMP.\nWE DON'T NEED A STAGED INTERVIEW ON \"60 MINUTES\" WITH ALL MY\nRESPECT TO LESLIE STAHL TO LEARN MUCH MORE ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND\nI THINK WHAT WE SAW WITH THE STEVE BANNON PICK TELLS YOU MUCH\nMORE THAN ANYTHING HE SAID LAST NIGHT WHILE SITTING IN THAT\nGRAND ROOM. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PUSSY FOOTING\nABOUT THIS A BIT BUT STEVE BANNON IS AN ALLY OF WHITE\nNATIONALISTS. HOW DO WE KNOW THIS?\nBECAUSE STEVE BANNON SAID TO ONE OF OUR REPORTERS OF MOTHER JONES\nAND ELSEWHERE AS WELL THAT HE WANTED BREITBART, THE NEWS\nSERVICE HE LED, TO BE A PLATFORM FOR THE ALT RIGHT.\nWHAT IS THE ALT RIGHT? A FAR RIGHT CONSERVATIVE\nMOVEMENT THAT DOES BELIEVE IN WHITE NATIONALISM OR WHITE SPREM\nSUPREMACY. AND WANTS AMERICA TO BE A WHITE\nSTATE AND RACE IS MOST IMPORTANT.\n>> DAVID, THIS REPRESENTS STEVE BANNON, WHY AREN'T WE HEARING\nFROM MORE REPUBLICANS? MODERATE REPUBLICANS.\nI ASKED KELLY O'DONNELL WHAT SHE'S HEARING ON CAPITOL HILL\nAND THEY'RE NOT THERE BUT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T\nCOMMUNICATE. PEOPLE POP UP ON CABLE NEWS\nEVERY DAY. >> I THINK THEY'RE CHICKEN.\nI THINK THEY'RE CHICKEN. AND I THINK HONEST REPORTING HAS\nTO POINT OUT WHO STEVEN BANNON IS AND NOT JUST SAY HE'S MADE\nINCENDIARY REMARKS OR HE'S CONTROVERSIAL.\nHE IS ALIVE WITH RACISTS. HE MAY NOT BE RACIST HIMSELF.\nI DON'T KNOW THE MAN. REINCE PRIEBUS SAID HE'S A\nWONDERFUL FELLOW. I THINK WE CAN ALL PUT THAT\nASIDE BECAUSE I'M SURE THERE'S A LOT OF RACISTS AND MISOGYNISTS\nOUT THERE WHO ARE VERY NICE WHEN THEY'RE DEALING WITH PEOPLE AT\nWORKPLACE OR COLLEAGUES BUT PARTICULARLY ON A POLITICAL\nCAMPAIGN. I THINK THIS IS A REALLY SERIOUS\nMOMENT WHICH IS WHY YOU SEE THE ADL AND OTHER GROUPS THAT\nMONITOR HATE CRIMES PULLING OUT THEIR HAIR THAT A PRESIDENT\nELECT PUTS A FELLOW WHO'S THIS LEAGUE WITH PEOPLE WHO WANT TO\nTURN AMERICA ALL WHITE. THIS IS NOT A CONSPIRACY THEORY.\nAND LATER IN THE DAY, I'LL PUT A PIECE UP FROM MOTHER JONES\nSPELLING THIS OUT BUT IT'S ALL OUT THERE TO SEE FOR THOSE WHO\nWANT TO SEE IT. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE POLICY\nTHINGS. NOW, PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP SAID\nHE'S NOT GOING TO REPLACE ALL OF OBAMACARE.\nHE WANTS TO KEEP THE MOST POPULAR PORTIONS OF IT.\nTHE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION ALWAYS SAID THIS WAS NOT A\nPERFECT SOLUTION BUT REPEAL AND RELACE IT AND THE DEPORTATION OF\nPEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY ILLEGALLY AND FOCUSSED ON CRIMINALS WHICH\nIS EXACTLY WHAT THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION'S POLICY IS RIGHT\nNOW AND ITS FOCUS BUT HILLARY CLINTON, THE BIG CHANT WAS LOCK\nHER UP. HERE'S WHAT HE SAID TO LESLIE\nSTAHL ABOUT PROSECUTING HILLARY CLINTON.\n>> IF I WIN, I AM GOING TO INSTRUCT MY ATTORNEY GENERAL TO\nGET A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR TO LOOK INTO YOUR SITUATION BECAUSE\nTHERE HAS NEVER BEEN SO MANY LIES, SO MUCH DECEPTION.\n>> AND IN HIS NEW INTERVIEW, HE SAYS HE'S BACKING OFF FROM THAT\nCLEARLY. >> ANYBODY WHO IS SURPRISED\nTODAY THAT DONALD TRUMP WILL NOT MAKE GOOD ON HIS CAMPAIGN\nPROMISES WAS NOT PAYING ATTENTION.\nBACK FLIPPED, DOUBLE FLIPPED, RAN AWAY AND SAID INCONSISTENT\nREMARKS THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE CAMPAIGN.\nHE DIDN'T JUST SAY THAT HE WOULD APPOINT A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR.\nAT A RALLY, VOWED SHE'D BE LOCKED UP IF HE BECAME PRESIDENT\nSO OBAMACARE, YOU CAN'T KEEP THE GOOD PARTS OF OBAMACARE AND GET\nRID OF THE MANDATE. HE'LL FIND THAT OUT IF HE READS\nMORE THAN ONE SINGLE PAGE ABOUT OBAMACARE.\nSO I MEAN, HE PEDALLED A CON GAME AND SAID HE'S GOING TO\nDRAIN THE SWAMP. HIS TRANSITION TEAM IS FULL OF\nLOBBYISTS AND THE HEAD OF THE POLITICAL PARTY FUNDED BY\nDONATIONS FROM SPECIAL CORPORATE INTERESTS ONE OF THE BIG GUYS IN\nTHE SWAMP. SO, YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY TO THE\n60 MILLION AMERICANS, THE MINORITY OF AMERICANS WHO VOTED\nFOR HIM. HE'S NOT GOING TO KEEP HIS WORD.\n>> JUST QUICKLY, HILLARY CLINTON, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\"\nNOW SAYS SHE WAS ON WITH SUPPORTERS BLAMING DIRECTOR\nCOMEY FOR STOPPING HER MOMENTUM WITH THAT FIRST STUNNING LETTER.\nAND THEN THE LETTER THAT ATTEMPTED TO CLEAR IT ALL UP\nWASN'T HELPFUL EITHER. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF AT LEAST\nTHIS ASSESSMENT FROM HER? >> I THINK SHE'S RIGHT IN THE\nSENSE THAT IT DIDN'T HELP AND IT PROBABLY HURT BUT OTHER THINGS\nWENT WRONG TOO. ULTIMATELY, SHE IS TO BLAME\nHERSELF AS IS HER CAMPAIGN. EVEN THOUGH THEY GOT A MAJORITY\nOF VOTES BY A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT MARGIN, THEY DID NOT DO A GOOD\nENOUGH JOB OF GETTING OUT AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS, SAY, IN\nMICHIGAN AND SO THEY MADE PLENTY OF MISTAKES TOO AND ANY ONE OF\nTHOSE MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE STRAW THAT BROKE THE BACK AND YOU\nCOULD SAY THE COMEY LETTER MIGHT HAVE BEEN THAT BUT OTHER THINGS\nWENT WRONG WITHIN HER CONTROL THAT SHE'S RESPONSIBLE FOR.\n>> DAVID, THANK YOU SO MUCH. GREATLY APPRECIATE IT.\n>> SORRY FOR BEING ADAMANT BUT I FEEL KIND OF PASSIONATE.\n>> YOU SHOULD NEVER BE SORRY. THAT'S DEMOCRACY.\nWE'RE NOT GOING TO STOP TELLING THE TRUTH OR GIVING VOICE TO\nPEOPLE'S OPINIONS. JUST THE CAUSE.\nTHAT'S WHAT WE DO.", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1479144786626.1479141417242.ac92fbb2-b873-4735-932f-b0260226092f.segment1.thumb.jpg", "channel": "356"}, {"start": 1017860, "length": 197764.0, "end": 1215624, "date": 1479143247185, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1479143231769.64f47431-359c-433d-b564-d76a3a9f35b5.mp4#t=1017.86,1215.62", "text": ">>> WELCOME BACK.\nLET'S GET MORE INTO THE BACKLASH OF THE HIRING OF STEVE BANNON\nFOR THE TEAM TRUMP.

AFTER MONTHS SLAMMING\nPRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP AS UNFIT AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF.\nHE DECLINED TO CONTINUE THE DISQUAL\nDISQUALIFICATIONS. I ASKED IF TRUMP WAS STILL UNFIT\nTO LEAD. HERE IS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY.\n>> THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN. TRUMP WILL BE THE NEXT\nPRESIDENT. THE 45th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES. AND IT WILL BE UP TO HIM TO SET\nUP A TEAM THAT HE THINKS WILL SERVE HIM WELL AND REFLECT HIS\nPOLICIES. AND THOSE WHO DIDN'T VOTE FOR\nHIM HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT'S HOW DEMOCRACY WORKS.\n>> Reporter: I ALSO ASKED THE PRESIDENT WHAT SORT OF MESSAGE\nHE THINKS THAT PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP IS SENDING BY TAPPING\nSTEVE BANNON TO BE THE CHIEF STRATEGIST AND ADVISER IN THE\nWHITE HOUSE. BREITBART NEWS HAS CHAMPIONED\nWHITE NATIONALISTS THEMES. >> CAMPAIGNING IS DIFFERENT FROM\nGOVERNING. I THINK HE RECOGNIZES THAT.\nI THINK HE IS SINCERE IN WANTING TO BE A SUCCESSFUL PRESIDENT AND\nMOVING THIS COUNTRY FORWARD. I DON'T THINK ANY PRESIDENT EVER\nCOMES IN SAYING TO HIMSELF I WANT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE\nPEOPLE ANGRY OR ALIENATE HALF THE COUNTRY.\nI THINK HE'S GOING TO TRY AS BEST HE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT HE\nDELIVERS. NOT ONLY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO\nVOTED FOR HIM, BUT FOR THE PEOPLE AT LARGE.\n>> Reporter: THE PRESIDENT ALSO OFFERED TRUMP SOME ADVICE SAYING\nBECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF CAMPAIGNS AND BITTERNESS AND\nVEROCITY SURROUNDING THE CAMPAIGNS, IT IS IMPORTANT FOR\nTRUMP TO SEND SIGNALS OF UNITY AND REACH OUT TO MINORITY GROUPS\nAND WOMEN OR ANY OTHER VOTERS WHO MAY NOT BE TRUMP SUPPORTERS.\nHE SOUNDED ON A HOPEFUL NOTE. HE FOUND TRUMP DURING THE 90\nMINUTES IN THE OVAL OFFICE WITH HIM LAST WEEK TO BE NON\nIDEOLOGUE, BUT PRAGMATIC.", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1479214124574.1479207733923.962834bd-ffd1-45ba-8bba-33a3a4526661.segment7.thumb.jpg", "channel": "202"}, {"start": 613417.0, "length": 435615.0, "end": 1049032, "date": 1479209560852, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1479212206852.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1479209545694-2c90929a-ec59-4cf2-8dc8-d142cce80165-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=613.42,1049.03", "text": ">>> SO PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS A\nTRICKY TASK. HIS SIDE LOST THE ELECTION, YET\nNOW AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, HE HAS TO GO AND TELL\nPEOPLE EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE OKAY.\nSO HE'S ON THIS FAREWELL INTERNATIONAL TOUR.\nGREECE, GERMANY, PERU. BUT BEFORE TAKING OFF, PRESIDENT\nOBAMA DID HOLD HIS FIRST PRESS CONFERENCE SINCE PRESIDENT-ELECT\nDONALD TRUMP'S HISTORIC AND UNEXPECTED WIN LAST WEEK.\nAND HE TALKED ABOUT THE ELECTION AND WHAT HE SEES AS THE NEXT\nPRESIDENT'S LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS.\n>> CAMPAIGNING IS DIFFERENT FROM GOVERNING.\nI THINK HE RECOGNIZES THAT. I THINK HE'S SINCERE IN WANTING\nTO BE A SUCCESSFUL PRESIDENT. AND MOVING THIS COUNTRY FORWARD.\nI DON'T THINK ANY PRESIDENT EVER COMES IN SAYING TO HIMSELF, I\nWANT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE PEOPLE ANGRY OR ALIENATE HALF\nTHE COUNTRY. >> LET'S DIG INTO WHAT HE SAID\nWITH OUR POLITICAL PANEL, DANA BASH AND JOHN AVALON.\nDANA, SAYING SOMEONE IS NOT IDEOLOGICAL BUT PRAGMATIC IS\nOFTEN A NICE WAY OF SAYING SOMETHING THAT'S NOT SO NICE,\nWHICH IS THIS PERSON DOESN'T REALLY BELIEVE ANYTHING, SO\nWE'LL HAVE TO SEE WHAT THEY GET DONE.\n>> THAT'S TRUE. BUT I THINK IN THIS CASE, MY\nREAD OF WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID WAS THAT HE ACTUALLY HAS IT\nIN HIM TO DO -- TO GET SOME STUFF DONE, AS LONG AS HE'S GOT\nPEOPLE AROUND HIM WHO CAN GUIDE HIM TO DO THAT, AND AS LONG AS\nHE PAYS ATTENTION TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT, YOU KNOW -- I THINK\nTHIS IS WHAT HE WAS TRYING TO SAY -- SOME OF THE THINGS IN MY\nAGENDA, PRESIDENT OBAMA'S AGENDA, THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY\nLIKED. MY SORT OF BROADER TAKEAWAY FROM\nWHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS DOING WAS TO ME, IT WAS AS IF WHEN HE\nDECLINED SO MANY TIMES TO BITE ON STEVE BANNON OR ANYTHING ELSE\nABOUT WHAT HE SAID ABOUT DONALD TRUMP BEFORE THE ELECTION WAS\nTHIS IS HOW YOU DO IT. IT WAS ALMOST AS IF HE WAS\nSENDING A SIGNAL TO DONALD TRUMP.\nTHAT WAS CAMPAIGNING AND THIS IS GOVERNING.\nAND THERE'S A DEFEIFFERENCE. THIS IS HOW YOU ACT.\nTHIS IS HOW YOU PURPORT YOURSELF.\n>> THAT'S REALLY A HELPFUL ANALYSIS.\nTHERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE WHO DISLIKE TRUMP, SO MANY OF\nHILLARY CLINTON'S SUPPORTERS WHO ARE LIKE, WHAT'S HAPPENING?\nHOW COULD THE PRESIDENT HAVE GONE, YOU KNOW, IN THE SPACE OF\n24 HOURS FROM SAYING THIS MAN'S A DANGER, HE'S UNFIT, TO NOW\nSAYING I THINK THAT HE'S GOING TO DO VERY WELL.\nIT'S COGNITIVE DISSONANCE FOR PEOPLE.\nTHEY DON'T SPEAK WASHINGTON SPEAK.\n>> I THINK THEY ALSO FUNDAMENTALLY MISUNDERSTAND THE\nRESPONSIBILITIES OF BEING PRESIDENT.\nTHERE'S A HIGHER FORM OF PATRIOTISM.\nTHAT'S ENSHRINED BY THE PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER.\nTHERE IS CAMPAIGNING AND THE PERSONAL VIEWS THAT THE\nPRESIDENT MAY HAVE. BUT THIS IS PROFESSIONAL.\nTHIS IS ABOUT THE COUNTRY. SAYING THAT SOMEONE IS NOT AN\nIDEOLOGUE BUT PRAGMATIC IS A COMPLIMENT.\nIT'S THE GLASS HALF FULL. THIS IS DONALD THE DEAL MAKER.\nNOW THAT THE ELECTION IS OVER, HE'S GOING TO TRY TO UNITE THE\nNATION BECAUSE HE HAS TO. HE HAS UNIFIED CONTROL OF\nGOVERNMENT. MAYBE HE WILL BE MORE PRAGMATIC\nBECAUSE HE DOESN'T COME FROM AN IDEOLOGICAL OPPORTUNITY.\n>> IT DEPENDS ON WHAT THE STUFF IS, DANA.\nYOU SAID I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS SUGGESTING HE CAN GET SOME\nSTUFF DONE. IF THAT STUFF IS REPEALING\nOBAMACARE JUST TO SHOW HE GOT HIS SUCCESS, THAT'S NOT STUFF\nTHAT I THINK OBAMA WILL BE CALLING POSITIVE PRAGMATISM.\n>> NO, I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT.\nI THINK THAT HE'S RESIGNED TO THE FACT THAT EVER SINCE\nOBAMACARE WAS ENACTED INTO LAW IN 2009, '10, HE REALIZED THAT\nTHE REPUBLICANS MADE IT THEIR MISSION TO REPEAL IT, AND NOW\nTHEY HAVE FULL CONTROL OF CONGRESS, A REPUBLICAN IN THE\nWHITE HOUSE, AND SOME OF THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.\nBUT THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES WHERE HE CLEARLY WAS REASSURED BY\nDONALD TRUMP. I'M GOING TO GO OUT ON A CRAZY\nLIMB HERE. >> GO FOR IT.\n>> I THINK THAT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT DONALD TRUMP, AFTER HE GETS\nSOME WINS WITH THE CONSERVATIVES BY PUTTING A CONSERVATIVE ON THE\nCOURT, MAYBE DEALING WITH OBAMACARE, HE CAN BE A PERSON\nWHO CAN DO IMMIGRATION REFORM. HE CAN ACTUALLY NOT ONLY JUST DO\nIMMIGRATION REFORM, MAYBE NOT ONE BIG PACKAGE, BUT ULTIMATELY\nHAVE A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP BECAUSE --\n>> ONLY NIXON CAN GO TO CHINA. >> RIGHT.\nTHE MAIN REASON WHY REPUBLICAN LEADERS COULDN'T DO THAT BEFORE\nIS THE BASE WOULD HAVE GONE CRAZY.\nHE'S THE GUY, HE'S THE ONE GUY AT THIS POINT WHO THEY TRUST.\n>> ONLY NIXON CAN GO TO CHINA, AND THAT'S A STRATEGIC POSITION\nOF STRENGTH FOR TRUMP TO BE IN. HE'S GOT THE BASE.\nHE MAY BE BEST POSITIONED, IRONICALLY, TO BUILD UP BEYOND\nIT. IT'LL BE FASCINATING TO SEE IF\nTHAT'S THE DIRECTION HE GOES. BUT AS YOU'RE ALSO FIGURING OUT,\nSOME OF THIS UNENTANGLING IS MORE DIFFICULT.\nIF YOU TAKE AWAY PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, WHICH HE SAID HE\nWOULD TRY TO KEEP, THAT HAS A CASCADING EFFECT THAT HURTS\nPEOPLE. THAT'S NOT HIS INTENTION EITHER.\nHE'S GOING TO BE WALKING THAT LINE, TRYING TO MAKE SURE\nCONSERVATIVES GET WHAT HE WANTS TO DELIVER, BUT HE'S GOT AN\nOPPORTUNITY TO RESHUFFLE THE DECK.\n>> YOU HEAR MORE AND MORE FROM HIS PEOPLE.\nI DON'T THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE THE MIRROR IMAGE OF WHAT WE\nSAW WITH THEN PRESIDENT-ELECT OBAMA AND EARLY PRESIDENT OBAMA,\nWHICH IS THIS IS MY SIGNATURE MOVE, I'M GOING TO DO IT.\nI THINK THAT UNDOING THIS HEALTH CARE PLAN, NO MATTER HOW YOU\nFEEL ABOUT IT, IS SO ONEROUS, HE CAN'T GET IT DONE QUICKLY.\nYOU NEED A YEAR LEAD TIME JUST FOR THE CONTRACTS TO CANCEL THAT\nPEOPLE ARE SIGNING RIGHT NOW. YOU WON'T GET A QUICK WIN.\nYOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO MAY BE, YOU KNOW,\nHURT BY THIS. I DON'T THINK IT'S ON THE TOP OF\nTHE LIST. I THINK THEY'LL ANNOUNCE IT BUT\nWON'T WORK ON IT ACTIVELY. THEY'LL WORK ON OTHER THINGS\nTHEY CAN GET DONE. >> IT'LL BE JOBS.\nHE'S GOING TO DO INFRASTRUCTURE AT A MAJOR LEVEL WE'VE NEVER\nSEEN BEFORE. THAT SHOULD HAVE BIPARTISAN\nSUPPORT. >> EXECUTIVE ORDERS WHERE HE\nSTRIPS AWAY REGULATIONS. >> THE PRESIDENT SAID DONALD\nTRUMP SAID HE WASN'T AS FOCUSED ON WITHDRAWING FROM NATO.\n>> OH, HE WAS FOCUSED ON MAKING IT A ROBUST RELATIONSHIP,\nMAINTAINING IT. >> THAT WOULD CONTRADICT THINGS\nDONALD TRUMP HAS WRITTEN IN BOOKS AS FAR BACK AS 2000, BUT\nTHAT WOULD ALSO BE A RECOGNITION OF REALITY.\nH >> HIS CAVEAT IS HE SAYS I'M\nGOOD WITH NATO, THEY JUST HAVE TO PAY MORE.\n>> MAYBE WE'LL SEE DONALD THE DEAL MAKER STEP IN AND READJUST.\nTHE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO BE GIVING A SPEECH ABOUT GLOBAL\nPOPULISM AND THE LACK OF TRUST IN INSTITUTIONS.\nTHAT'S ONE OF THE HIGH STAKES QUESTIONS THAT TOO OFTEN WE\nDON'T DISCUSS IN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE IT SEEMS FOREIGN\nTO US, BUT IT'S CORE TO THE STRUCTURE.\n>> YOU TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA IS -- YOU\nKNOW, HE JUST TOUCHED DOWN IN GREECE.\nCAN WE WRAP OUR MINDS AROUND THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA IS\nEFFECTIVELY AN AMBASSADOR RIGHT NOW FOR PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP TO\nTRY TO CALM -- I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT HE IS.\nHIS JOB IS TO CALM PEOPLE DOWN AROUND THE WORLD.\nTHAT'S WHAT HE'S GOING TO BE DOING.\n>> AND WHAT A TOUGH JOB THAT IS. TALK ABOUT OPPOSITE WORLD.\nYOU HAVE TO GO TO GREECE TO CALM THEM DOWN ABOUT WHAT WE MIGHT\nMEAN TO THEM. THAT SINK HOLE OF INTERNATIONAL\nFUNDS. >> STRANGE BEDFELLOWS THAT HAVE\nBEEN CREATED BY ALL OF THIS.

BUT YEAH, USE THE WORD RATTLED.\nTHAT'S HOW PRESIDENT OBAMA DESCRIBED MANY TIMES OVER THE\nLAST YEAR WORLD LEADERS AT THE PROSPECT OF A TRUMP PRESIDENCY.\nSO A BIG CHUNK OF HIS DEALINGS WITH THEM HAS BEEN TO REASSURE\nTHEM THAT U.S. POLICIES AND RELATIONSHIPS WOULD BE WELL.\nWELL, NOW A MUCH DIFFERENT HORIZON AS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S\nSUN SETS AND WE'RE HEARING FROM HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME\nPOST-ELECTION. PRESIDENT OBAMA TOUCHES DOWN ON\nHIS FINAL FOREIGN TRIP IN ATHENS.\nFIRST AT HOME WHILE THE INCOMING TRUMP TEAM FEVERISHLY PREPARES\nTO RUN AMERICA, THE OUTGOING PRESIDENT ADDRESSED THE PRESS\nAND WORLD AFTER WHAT HE DIDN'T THINK COULD HAPPEN DID.\n>> AND THAT'S WHY ENSURING A SMOOTH TRANSITION IS SO\nIMPORTANT. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT THE\nCONSTITUTION EXPLICITLY REQUIRES, BUT IT IS ONE OF THOSE\nNORMS THAT ARE VITAL TO A FUNCTIONING DEMOCRACY.\n>> Reporter: THAT SOUNDED LIKE BOTH REASSURANCE AS WELL AS A\nDIG, ALMOST A WARNING AS HE'S ASKED POINT-BLANK, ARE YOU\nCONCERNED ABOUT A TRUMP PRESIDENCY.\n>> HE'S COMING TO THIS OFFICE WITH FEWER SET HARD AND FAST\nPOLICY PRESCRIPTIONS THAN A LOT OF OTHER PRESIDENTS MIGHT BE\nARRIVING WITH. I DON'T THINK HE'S IDEOLOGICAL.\nULTIMATELY, HE'S PRAGMATIC IN THAT WAY.\nAND THAT CAN SERVE HIM WELL. DO I HAVE CONCERNS?\nABSOLUTELY. OF COURSE I'VE GOT CONCERNS.\nONE OF THE THINGS I ADVISED HIM TO DO WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT\nBEFORE HE COMMITS TO CERTAIN COURSES OF ACTION, HE'S REALLY\nDUG IN AND THOUGHT THROUGH HOW VARIOUS ISSUES PLAY THEMSELVES\nOUT. >> Reporter: HE SAID IN HIS\nMEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT-ELECT LAST WEEK, DONALD TRUMP DID\nEXPRESS A COMMITMENT TO NATO, DESPITE HIS RHETORIC ON THE\nTRAIL, AND IS NOW RETHINKING WHAT PARTS OF OBAMACARE HE MIGHT\nPRESERVE. >> I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US\nTO LET HIM MAKE HIS DECISIONS, AND I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\nWILL JUDGE. >> Reporter: WANTING TO PUT SOME\nOPTIMISM THERE, EVEN AS A STILL SHELL-SHOCKED PARTY PICKS UP THE\nPIECES, THE PRESIDENT SAYING REFLECTION WILL BE HEALTHY FOR\nDEMOCRATS AND FOR DONALD TRUMP. >> THERE ARE GOING TO BE CERTAIN\nELEMENTS OF HIS TEMPERAMENT THAT WILL NOT SERVE HIM WELL UNLESS\nHE RECOGNIZES THEM AND CORRECTS THEM.\nIF THINGS GET WORSE, THEN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL FIGURE THAT\nOUT PRETTY QUICK. AND IF THINGS GET BETTER, THEN\nMORE POWER TO HIM. AND I'LL BE THE FIRST TO\nCONGRATULATE HIM. >> Reporter: PRESIDENT OBAMA\nCLEARLY WANTED TO GET HIS POINT ACROSS HERE.\nHE SAID THAT CAMPAIGNING IS NOT GOVERNING, THAT SOUND BITES ARE\nNOT POLICIES. HE DID SAY HE BELIEVES DONALD\nTRUMP IS SINCERE IN WANTING TO MAKE AMERICA BETTER, BUT HE\nNEEDS TO REACH OUT TO CERTAIN GROUPS LIKE MINORITIES AND\nWOMEN. CHRIS?\n>> ALL RIGHT, MICHELLE KOSINSKI, ENJOY THE TRIP.\nTHANK YOU VERY MUCH. LET'S DISCUSS THE LATEST ON\nTRUMP'S TRANSITION TO THE WHITE HOUSE WITH CNN POLITICAL ANALYST\nAND \"NEW YORK TIMES\" CORRESPONDENT PATRICK HEALY AND\nCNN POLITICAL ANALYST DAVID GREGORY.\nBROTHER HEALY, WHAT ARE YOU HEARING FROM YOUR SOURCES ABOUT\nWHAT THIS DYNAMIC IS AND IS NOT WITHIN TRUMP-DOM?\n>> TRUMP SOURCES TELLING ME THEY WANT TO END THE KNIFE FIGHT\nSTORY QUICKLY, THAT THERE ARE TENSIONS INSIDE THE EMERGING\nPOWER CENTERS, NOT ONLY WITHIN THE CAMPAIGN, BUT TENSIONS\nAROUND SECRETARY OF STATE, ATTORNEY GENERAL, WHO ELSE IS\nCOMING INTO THE WHITE HOUSE. NOW THEY HAVE THIS EXTRA LEVEL\nOF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE KIDS AND THE SECURITY CLEARANCES.\nWHAT THEY HAVE MADE VERY CLEAR TO ME IS THAT DONALD TRUMP SPENT\nALMOST A YEAR BASHING HILLARY CLINTON ABOUT HER HANDLING OF\nCLASSIFIED MATERIAL AND WHO SAW THAT CLASSIFIED MATERIAL,\nWHETHER IT WAS HER DAUGHTER CHELSEA, WHETHER IT WAS HUMA\nABEDIN, JAKE SULLIVAN, HOW THEY HANDLED IT.\nHE DOES NOT WANT TO FACE ANY KIND OF A SITUATION WHERE HE'S\nTALKING TO IVANKA TRUMP, WHO IS ONE OF HIS CLOSEST ADVISERS, AND\nQUESTIONS COME UP FROM CONGRESS, SHOULD YOU HAVE BEEN SHARING\nTHAT INFORMATION WITH IVANKA TRUMP?\nSO THEY'RE TRYING TO TIGHTEN THINGS UP.\nTHEY DON'T LIKE WHERE THINGS HAVE GOTTEN IN TERMS OF STORY\nLINES ABOUT THESE PRESSURES. >> SO DAVID, WHY WOULD THE KIDS\nNEED SECURITY CLEARANCE? I MEAN, WHAT PATRICK IS SAYING\nIS HE'LL BE TALKING TO THEM A LOT ABOUT POLICIES.\nIS THAT GOING TO BE THEIR ROLE IN THE WHITE HOUSE?\n>> LOOK, IT COULD BE. THESE ARE TWO, IN KUSHNER AND\nIVANKA, THEY HAVE BEEN VERY CLOSED EADVISERS.\nI THINK THEY'VE BEEN TO THE PRESIDENT-ELECT A KIND OF VOICE\nOF REASON, A REALITY CHECK ON HIM, PEOPLE THAT HE TRUSTS VERY\nMUCH. THEY'VE PLAYED AN INCREASINGLY\nIMPORTANT ROLE. THERE'S NOTHING USUAL OR\nORTHODOX ABOUT HOW TRUMP HAS GONE ABOUT HIS ORGANIZATION AND\nHIS TEAM OF ADVISERS. I THINK AT THIS JUNCTURE, AS\nMUCH AS THERE'S TALK ABOUT SEPARATING WHAT THEY DO AND\nHAVING THEM FOCUS ON THE BIDS, I THINK HE WANTS THEM TO BE CLOSE\nAND ADVISE HIM. I THINK WHAT PAT IS GETTING AT,\nTOO, WHAT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR THIS TEAM RIGHT NOW IS THAT THEY\nDON'T COME OFF AS DISORGANIZED. THERE'S EVERY REASON THAT CAN\nHAPPEN, BOTH BECAUSE OF THE CULTURAL FIGHTS WITHIN THIS\nINNER CIRCLE AND APPLYING THAT TO A NEW ROLE, WHICH IS TO\nORGANIZE THE GOVERNMENT, SOMETHING HE DOESN'T HAVE\nEXPERIENCE DOING. >> WELL, THE RELEVANT QUESTION\nABOUT THIS INFIGHTING, THERE'S ALWAYS INFIGHTING IN THESE KIND\nOF THINGS. ARE YOU PICKING UP ANYTHING\nTHAT'S UNIQUE TO THIS DYNAMIC THAT SHOULD BE OF CONCERN?\n>> WHAT THEY KEEP PUSHING BACK IS THAT THIS ISN'T THAT UNUSUAL.\nYOU HAVE A GUY WHO'S NEVER BEEN IN POLITICS.\nIT'S THE FIRST PRESIDENT REALLY SINCE EISENHOWER WHO HASN'T HAD\nANY KIND OF DIRECT GOVERNMENT EXPERIENCE, HELD PUBLIC OFFICE\nBEFORE. AND YOU'RE IN UNCHARTED\nTERRITORY. THIS IS A GUY WHO DOESN'T\nNECESSARILY HAVE A KITCHEN CABINET OF EXECUTIVES OR FELLOW\nPOLITICIANS WHO HAVE BEEN THROUGH SECURITY CLEARANCES\nBEFORE. HE HAS HIS CHILDREN.\nHE RELIES ON HIS CHILDREN. HE WANTS THE CHILDREN TO TAKE\nOVER THE COMPANIES. HE WANTS THEM ADVISING ON WHO\nSMART HIRES ARE. HE WANTS TO BE ABLE TO SPITBALL\nIDEAS LIKE HE HAS FOR YEARS WITH THEM.\nSO I THINK THE TENSION -- ALSO, THOUGH, THE PERSONALITIES.\nYOU TWO KNOW RUDY GIULIANI EXTREMELY WELL.\nHE'S SOMEONE WHO WAS SOLID BEHIND DONALD TRUMP, WHO\nPRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP REALLY CAME TO RELY ON.\nDURING THE YEARS, EVEN WHEN GIULIANI WAS MAYOR OF NEW YORK,\nI THINK TRUMP HAD A LOT OF RESPECT FOR HOW HE DIDN'T PUT UP\nWITH, YOU KNOW, MUCH GUFF. I THINK HE LIKED THAT.\nYOU'RE SEEING PEOPLE AROUND GIULIANI WHO ARE PUSHING FOR AN\nANNOUNCEMENT OF SOME KIND. >> SO NOW THERE'S TALK THAT RUDY\nGIULIANI WANTS SECRETARY OF STATE OR THAT HE WILL BECOME\nSECRETARY OF STATE, BUTHE OTHER NAME IN CONTENTION IS\nFORMER AMBASSADOR JOHN BOLT BANNON.\nSO RUDY GIULIANI WAS AT AN EVENT LAST NIGHT AND ASKED ABOUT THIS.\nLET ME PLAY THIS FOR YOU. >> JOHN WOULD BE A VERY GOOD\nCHOICE. >> IS THERE ANYBODY BETTER?\n>> MAYBE ME, I DON'T KNOW. >> OKAY.\nHE'S BEING COY, SORT OF. WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO\nHAPPEN? >> LOOK, I THINK THAT TRUMP\nVALUES LOYALTY ABOVE ALL ELSE. RUDY GIULIANI HAS BEEN A\nSCRAPPER FOR HIM, A STREET FIGHTER FOR HIM.\nIF HE THEN WANTS TO TURN OUT TO BE THE CHIEF DIPLOMAT, IT MIGHT\nMAKE YOU SCRATCH YOUR HEAD A LITTLE BIT.\nBUT IF YOU GO BACK OVER GIULIANI'S CAREER POSTPOST-9/11\nMAKES MORE SENSE. THIS IS SOMEONE WHO DEVELOPED A\nVOICE IN NATIONAL SECURITY AND FOREIGN POLICY AS A RESULT OF\n9/11. I THINK HE WANTS TO BRING THAT\nTO BEAR. HE'S TALKED ABOUT THE TOP\nPRIORITY BEING FIGHTING ISIS. I WOULD LOOK FOR GIULIANI TO\nPLAY THAT ROLE. IF HE DOESN'T WANT ATTORNEY\nGENERAL, I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING HE\nWANTED MORE. TO THIS OTHER POINT ABOUT\nDIVISIONS, IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT SOME RECENT HISTORY.\nTHE BUSH TEAM DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDEOLOGICAL DIVISIONS IN THEIR\nTEAM. HUGE DIVISIONS WITH REGARD TO\nNATIONAL SECURITY AS THAT PROGRESSED POST-9/11.\nYOU THINK ABOUT THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE.\nTHERE WAS A PRAGMATIC STREAK. THEN YOU HAD DAVID AXELROD, WHO\nWAS THE KEEPER OF THE FLAME IN TERMS OF PROGRESSIVE IDEOLOGY.\nHERE YOU HAVE A MUCH BIGGER SCHISM WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN\nRANKS, AN ESTABLISHMENT VISION IN A REINCE PRIEBUS AND A GUY\nLIKE STEVE BANNON WHO IS VERY MUCH THE STRIDENT, POPULIST,\nCONTROVERSIAL FOR THINGS AT BREITBART THAT HE SAID AND\nPUBLISHED, THAT CREATES A LOT OF ANXIETY HERE.\n>> HOW MUCH ARE YOU HEARING, PATRICK, ABOUT NEGATIVE REACTION\nTO BANNON WITHIN THE RANKS AS THEY TRY TO EXPAND THE TENT OF\nGETTING IN TALENT TO WORK THE GOVERNMENT?\n>> NOT A LOT OF NEGATIVE REACTION, AT LEAST WITHIN THAT\nCAMP. THEY'VE KNOWN STEVE BANNON FOR\nMONTHS. THEY KNEW THE BREITBART ATTACKS,\nYOU KNOW, WERE GOING TO COME. THE FEELING IS THAT THEY THINK\nTHEY'VE DONE AN EFFECTIVE JOB SEPARATING BANNON FROM\nBREITBART, AS HARD AS THAT SEEMS TO DO, SORT OF SAYING, YOU KNOW,\nBREITBART HAS PUBLISHED A LOT OF COLUMNS, A LOT OF STORIES,\nPROVOCATIVE HEADLINES. SO DOES \"THE NEW YORK POST,\" FOX\nNEWS, AGAIN SORT OF MAKING EXPLANATIONS.\nTHEY FEEL LIKE THEY'RE OKAY IN THE PLACE THEY ARE, WHERE THERE\nISN'T A LOT OF TAPE COMING OUT OF STEVE BANNON'S MOUTH, YOU\nKNOW, COMMENTS THAT CAN BE SORT OF HUNG AROUND HIS NECK.\nTHEY THINK THEY'RE GOING TO GET THROUGH THIS.\n>> OKAY. GUYS, THANKS VERY MUCH FOR ALL\nOF THE INSIGHT. WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT\nMORE UP NEXT BECAUSE THESE TRANSITION TENSIONS, THERE ARE\nINTERNAL DISAGREEMENTS OVER WHO WILL BE IN TRUMP'S CABINET.\nWHAT EXACTLY IS GOING ON IN THE WAR ROOM?\nWE HAVE A MEMBER OF THE TRUMP TRANSITION TEAM WHO WILL TAKE US\nINSIDE.", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1479216953614.1479213154150.9d1e28c7-bdbb-4c31-8a1b-91dbee5ed007.segment0.thumb.jpg", "channel": "202"}], "channel": "202"}, {"videos": [{"start": 1412010, "length": 387187.0, "end": 1799197, "date": 1479182932251, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1479182917909.eb2b126f-7802-4cb6-a7b3-a552b2685b65.mp4#t=1412.01,1799.20", "text": "NOW.\n>>> GOOD EVENING FROM OUR HEADQUARTERS HERE IN NEW YORK.\nTHE SPECULATION IS CENTERED AROUND DONALTRUMP'S ELECTION.\nTHE TRUMP TEAM RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE TO\nGIVE -- TRUMP'S OWN CHILDREN SAID THIS ON 60 MINUTES.\n>> SO WE'LL BE IN NEW YORK AND WE'LL TAKE CARE OF THE CHILDREN.\nWE'LL MAKE HIM VERY PROUD. >> PEOPLE THINK YOU'RE GOING TO\nBE PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION IVANKA.\n>> NO.

I CAN ASSURE YOU, AND I KNOW\nPRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP WANTS EVERYONE TO UNDERSTAND THIS.\nHE WANTS TO MAKE YOUR PROUD OF OUR COUNTRY.\nHE WANTS TO SERVE YOU. >> I WORK WITH STEVE UNDER A\nFIRE FOR FOUR OR FIVE MONTHS DURING THE ELECTION.\nI FIND HIM TO BE A VERY DECENT AND VERY GOOD, EXTREMELY SMART\nMAN. SOME TIMES YOU GET LABELED A\nCERTAIN WAY OR ANOTHER WAY. I THINK PEOPLE ARE GOING TO FIND\nIN HIM A REAL ASSET TO THE COUNTRY.\n>> SO YOU THINK THE CRITICISM IS UNFAIR?\n>> OH, YEAH, WAY OVER THE TOP.

HE TALKED ABOUT IRAN, IRAQ, WHAT\nTHE RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA SHOULD BE, HOW HE WOULD CHANGE\nRELATIONSHIPS WITH RUSSIA. HE TALKED ABOUT WHAT HE THINKS\nSHOULD BE DONE ON CANCELLING THE IRAN DEAL, THAT IT CAN BE\nCANCELLED BY THIS PRESIDENT OR RENEGOTIATED.\nIT WAS STUNNING TO PEOPLE, DEMOCRATS AS WELL AS RPS THAT\nHIS ENTIRE SPEECH WAS DEVOTED FOR ALL INTENSIVE PURPOSES TO\nSHOWING HIS CHOPS, VERY DETAILED, SPECIFICS, NUMBERS,\nTHE DEFENSE BUDGET. HE WAS CLEARLY SHOWING HIS GRASP\nOF WHAT I'M SURE DONALD TRUMP IS VERY IMPRESSED WITH, HIS ABILITY\nTO BE SECRETARY OF STATE. HE MADE IT CLEAR THAT IS THE JOB\nHE WANTS. HE SAID HE DOES NOT WANT TO BE\nATTORNEY. OTHERS ARE SUGGESTING HUTCHESON\nFOR ATTORNEY GENERAL. >> THE NAMES ARE STARTING TO\nCOME OUT FOR DIFFERENT JOBS.

THIS OFFICE IS BIGGER THAN ANY\nONE PERSON AND THAT'S WHY ENSURING A SMOOTH TRANSITION IS\nSO IMPORTANT. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT THE\nCONSTITUTION EXPLICITLY REQUIRES BUT IT IS ONE OF THOSE NORMS\nTHAT ARE VITAL TO A FUNCTIONING DEMOCRACY, SIMILAR TO NORMS OF\nCIVILITY AND TOLERANCE AND A COMMITMENT TO REASON AND TO\nFACTS AND ANALYSIS. IT'S PART OF WHAT MAKES THIS\nCOUNTRY WORK. AND AS LONG AS I'M PRESIDENT, WE\nARE GOING TO UPHOLD THOSE NORMS AND CHERISH AND UPHOLD THOSE\nIDEALS. AS I TOLD MY STAFF, WE SHOULD BE\nVERY PROUD THAT THEIR WORK HAS ALREADY ENSURED THAT WHEN WE\nTURN OVER THE KEYS, THE CAR IS IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE.\nWE ARE INDISPUTABLY IN A STRONGER POSITION TODAY THAN WE\nWERE WHEN I CAME IN EIGHT YEARS AGO.\nJOBS HAVE BEEN GROWING FOR 73 STRAIGHT MONTHS.\nINCOMES ARE RISING. POVERTY IS FALLING.\nTHE UNINSURED RATE IS AT THE LOWEST LEVEL ON RECORD.\nMY INSTRUCTIONS TO MY TEAM ARE WE RUN THROUGH THE TAPE.\nMAKE SURE THAT WE FINISH WHAT WE'VE STARTED.\nTHAT WE DON'T LET UP IN THESE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS BECAUSE MY\nGOAL IS ON JANUARY 21st AMERICA IS IN THE STRONGEST POSITION\nPOSSIBLE AND HOPEFULLY THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE NEXT\nPRESIDENT TO BUILD ON THAT. NUMBER TWO, OUR WORK HAS ALSO\nHELPED US STABILIZE THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND BECAUSE THERE IS ONE\nPRESIDENT AT A TIME, I'LL SPEND THIS WEEK RE-ENFORCING AMERICA'S\nSUPPORT FOR THE APPROACHES WE HAVE TAKEN THAT PROMOTE ECONOMIC\nGROWTH AND GLOBAL SECURITY ON A RANGE OF ISSUES.\nI LOOK FORWARD TO MY FIRST VISIT IN GREECE.\nAND THEN IN GERMANY I'LL VISIT WITH CHANCELLOR MERKEL WHO HAS\nPROBABLY BEEN ANY CLOSEST INTERNATIONAL PARTNER THESE PAST\nEIGHT YEARS. I'LL ALSO SIGNAL OUR SOLIDARITY\nWITH OUR CLOSEST ALLIES AND EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR A STRONG\nUNITED EUROPE. IT'S ESSENTIAL TO OUR NATIONAL\nSECURITY AND GLOBAL STABILITY AND THAT'S WHY THE TRANS\nATLANTIC ALLIANCE ENDURED FOR DECADES UNDER DEMOCRATIC AND\nREPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATIONS. IN PERU I'LL MEET WITH LEADERS\nWHO HAVE BEEN THE FOCUS OF OUR FOREIGN POLICY IN THE ASIA\nPACIFIC. THIS IS A TIME OF GREAT CHANGE\nIN THE WORLD BUT AMERICA HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PILLAR OF STRENGTH\nAND BEACON OF HOPE TO PEOPLES AROUND THE GLOBE AND THAT'S WHAT\nIT MUST CONTINUE TO BE. FINALLY, ON A PERSON NOTE\nMICHELLE AND I WANT TO OFFER OUR DEEPEST CONDOLENCES TO GWEN\nIFILL'S FAMILY AND ALL OF YOU, HER COLLEAGUES ON HER PASSING.\nGWEN WAS A FRIEND OF OURS. SHE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY\nJOURNALIST AND KEPT FAITH WITH HER PROFESSION, ASKING TOUGH\nQUESTIONS, HOLDING PEOPLE IN POWER ACCOUNTABLE AND DEFENDING\nA STRONG AND FREE PRESS THAT MAKES OUR DEMOCRACY WORK.\nI ALWAYS APPRECIATED GWEN REPORTING EVEN AT THE END OF ONE\nOF HER TOUGH AND THOROUGH INTERVIEWS WHETHER SHE REPORTED\nFROM A CONVENTION FLOOR OR FROM THE FIELD, WHETHER SHE SAT AT\nTHE DEBATE MODERATOR'S TABLE OR AT THE ANCHOR'S DESK SHE NOT\nONLY INFORMED TODAY'S CITIZENS BUT INSPIRED TOMORROW'S\nJOURNALISTS. SHE WAS AN ESPECIALLY POWERFUL\nROLE MODEL FOR YOUNG WOMEN AND GIRLS WHO ADMIRED HER INTEGRITY,\nTENACITY AND INTELLECT AND WHOM SHE BLAZED A TRAIL AS ONE HALF\nOF THE FIRST ALL FEMALE ANCHOR TEAM ON NETWORK NEWS.\nSO GWEN DID HER COUNTRY A GREAT SERVICE.\nMICHELLE AND I JOIN HER FAMILY AND HER COLLEAGUES AND EVERYBODY\nELSE WHO LOVED HER IN REMEMBERING HER FONDLY TODAY.\nSO WITH THAT, I'M GOING TO TAKE SOME QUESTIONS AND BECAUSE JOSH\nERNEST HAD SOME PULL AROUND HERE, HE JUST HAPPENED TO PUT AT\nTHE TOP OF THE LIST COAL BY NELSON OF WALL STREET JOURNAL.\nCOLLEEN, THIS IS WRAPPING UP YOUR STINT HERE AND YOU ARE\nGOING TO KANSAS CITY? >> YES.\n>> JUST HAPPENS TO BE FROM KANSAS CITY.\nSO I DIDN'T KNOW IF THERE WAS ANY COINCIDENCE THERE.\nBUT WE WISH YOU THE VERY BEST OF LUCK IN YOUR NEW ENDEAVORS.\n>> YOU'RE ABOUT TO EMBARK ON YOUR FINAL FOREIGN TRIP.\nWHAT WILL YOU SAY TO OTHER WORLD LEADERS ABOUT YOUR SUCCESSOR?\nTHEY HAVE EXPRESSED THE SAME MISGIVINGS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP.\nSHOULD THEY BE WORRIED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF FOREIGN POLICY AND\nSEPARATELY AS DEMOCRATS SCRAMBLE TO REGROUP AFTER A SHOCKING\nUPSET, WHAT IS YOUR ADVICE ABOUT WHERE THE PARTY GOES NOW AND WHO\nSHOULD LEAD YOUR PARTY? >> ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT\nTHE UNITED STATES IS THAT WHEN IT COMES TO WORLD AFFAIRS, THE\nPRESIDENT OBVIOUSLY IS THE LEADER OF EXECUTIVE BRANCH, THE\nCOMMANDER IN CHIEF, THE SPOKESPERSON FOR THE NATION, BUT\nTHE INFLUENCE AND THE WORK THAT WE HAVE IS THE RESULT NOT JUST\nOF THE PRESIDENT. IT IS THE RESULT OF COUNTLESS\nINTERACTIONS AND ARRANGEMENTS AND RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN OUR\nMILITARY AND OTHER MILITARIES AND OUR DIPLOMATS AND OTHER\nDIPLOMATS AND INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS AND DEVELOPMENT\nWORKERS. AND THERE'S ENORMOUS CONTINUITY\nBENEATH THE DAY TO DAY NEWS THAT MAKES US THAT INDISPENSABLE\nNATION WHEN IT COMES TO MAINTAINING ORDER AND PROMOTING\nPROSPERITY AROUND THE WORLD. THAT WILL CONTINUE.\nIN MY CONVERSATION WITH THE PRESIDENT-ELECT, HE EXPRESSED A\nGREAT INTEREST IN MAINTAINING OUR CORE STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS\nAND SO ONE OF THE MESSAGES I WILL BE ABLE TO DELIVER IS HIS\nCOMMITMENT TO NATO AND THE TRANSATLANTIC ALLIANCE.\nI THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS I CONSIDER\nAT THIS STAGE DURING THIS TRIP IS TO LET THEM KNOW THAT THERE\nIS NO WEAKENING WHEN IT COMES TO AMERICA'S COMMITMENT TO\nMAINTAINING A STRONG AND ROBUST NATO RELATIONSHIP AND A\nRECOGNITION THAT THOSE ALLIANCES AREN'T JUST GOOD FOR EUROPE,\nTHEY'RE GOOD FOR THE UNITED STATES.\nAND THEY'RE VITAL FOR THE WORLD. WITH RESPECT TO THE DEMOCRATIC\nPARTY, LOOK, AS I SAID IN THE ROSE GARDEN RIGHT AFTER THE\nELECTION, WHEN YOUR TEAM LOSES, EVERYBODY GETS DEFLATED AND IT'S\nHARD. AND IT'S CHALLENGING.\nSO I THINK IT'S A HEALTHY THING FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY TO GO\nTHROUGH SOME REFLECTION. YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT\nFOR ME NOT TO BE BIG-FOOTING THAT CONVERSATION.\nI THINK WE WANT TO SEE NEW VOICES AND NEW IDEAS EMERGE.\nTHAT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY -- I MEAN TERM LIMITS ARE A REALLY\nUSEFUL THING. I THINK THE DEMOCRATS SHOULD NOT\nWAIVER ON OUR CORE BELIEFS AND PRINCIPLES.\nTHE BELIEF THAT WE SHOULD HAVE AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR\nEVERYBODY, NOT JUST A FEW. THE BELIEF THAT AMERICA AT ITS\nBEST IS INCLUSIVE AND NOT EXCLUSIVE.\nTHAT WE INSIST ON THE DIGNITY AND GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL AND\nWORTH OF EVERY CHILD REGARDLESS OF RACE OR GENDER OR SEXUAL\nORIENTATION OR WHAT ZIP CODE THEY WERE BORN IN.\nTHAT WE ARE COMMITTED TO A WORLD IN WHICH WE KEEP AMERICA SAFE\nBUT WE RECOGNIZE THAT OUR POWER DOESN'T JUST FLOW FROM OUR\nEXTRAORDINARY MILITARY, IT ALSO FLOWS FROM THE STRENGTH OF OUR\nIDEALS, PRINCIPLES AND VALUES. THERE ARE GOING TO BE A CORE SET\nOF VALUES THAT SHOULDN'T BE UP FOR DEBATE.\nBUT HOW WE ORGANIZE POLITICALLY I THINK IS SOMETHING THAT WE\nSHOULD SPEND SOME TIME THINKING ABOUT.\nI BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE BETTER IDEAS BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT\nGOOD IDEAS DON'T MATTER IF PEOPLE DON'T HEAR THEM.\nAND ONE OF THE ISSUES THE DEMOCRATS HAVE TO BE CLEAR ON IS\nTHAT GIVEN POPULATION DISTRIBUTION ACROSS THE COUNTRY,\nWE HAVE TO COMPETE EVERYWHERE. WE HAVE TO SHOW UP EVERYWHERE.\nWE HAVE TO WORK AT A GRASS ROOTS LEVEL.\nSOMETHING THAT'S BEEN A RUNNING THREAD IN MY CAREER.\nYOU KNOW, I WON IOWA NOT BECAUSE THE DEMOGRAPHICS DICTATED THAT I\nWOULD WIN IOWA. IT WAS BECAUSE I SPENT 87 DAYS\nGOING TO EVERY SMALL TOWN AND FAIR AND FISH FRY AND VFW HALL\nAND THERE WERE SOME COUNTIES WHERE I MIGHT HAVE LOST BUT\nMAYBE I LOST BY 20 POINTS INSTEAD OF 50 POINTS.\nTHERE'S SOME COUNTIES MAYBE I WON THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T EXPECT\nBECAUSE PEOPLE HAD A CHANCE TO SEE YOU AND LISTEN TO YOU AND\nGET A SENSE OF WHO YOU STOOD FOR AND WHO YOU WERE FIGHTING FOR.\nAND THE CHALLENGE FOR A NATIONAL PARTY IS HOW DO YOU DIG IN THERE\nAND CREATE THOSE KINDS OF STRUCTURES SO THAT PEOPLE HAVE A\nSENSE OF WHAT IT IS THAT YOU STAND FOR.\nAND THAT INCREASINGLY IS DIFFICULT TO DO JUST THROUGH A\nNATIONAL PRESS -- IT'S INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO DO\nBECAUSE OF THE SPLINTERING. I THINK THE DISCUSSIONS THAT\nHAVE BEEN TAKEN PLACE ABOUT HOW DO YOU BUILD MORE GRASS ROOTS\nORGANIZING, HOW DO YOU BUILD STATE PARTIES AND LOCAL PARTIES\nAND SCHOOL BOARD ELECTIONS YOU'RE PAYING ATTENTION TO AND\nSTATE REP RACES AND CITY COUNCIL RACES.\nTHAT ALL I THINK WILL CONTRIBUTE TO STRONGER OUTCOMES IN THE\nFUTURE. AND I'M OPTIMISTIC THAT WILL\nHAPPEN. FOR DEMOCRATS WHO ARE FEELING\nCOMPLETELY REMIND THEM EVERYBODY REMEMBERS MY BOSTON\nSPEECH IN 2004. THEY MAY NOT REMEMBER ME SHOWING\nUP HERE IN 2005 WHEN JOHN KERRY HAD LOST A CLOSE ELECTION.\nTOM DASHLE, THE LEADER OF THE SENATE HAD BEEN UPSET.\nKEN SELLERS WAS THE ONLY DEMOCRATIC THAT WON NATIONALLY.\nREPUBLICANS CONTROLLED THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE AND TWO\nYEARS LATER DEMOCRATS WERE WINNING BACK CONGRESS AND FOUR\nYEARS LATER I WAS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nTHINGS CHANGE PRETTY RAPIDLY. BUT THEY DON'T CHANGE\nINEVITABLY. THEY CHANGE BECAUSE YOU WORK FOR\nIT. NOBODY SAID IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE\nEASY. IT'S HARD.\nAND IN A BIG COUNTRY LIKE THIS, IT PROBABLY SHOULD BE HARD.\nMARK NULLER. >> THANK YOU SIR.\n>> GOOD TO SEE YOU. >> THANK YOU.\nGOOD TO SEE YOU. MR. PRESIDENT, WHAT CAN YOU TELL\nUS ABOUT THE LEARNING CURVE ON BECOMING PRESIDENT?\nCAN YOU TELL US HOW LONG IT TOOK YOU BEFORE YOU WERE FULLY AT\nEASE IN THE JOB IF THAT EVER HAPPENS?\nAND DID YOU DISCUSS THIS MATTER WITH PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP?\n>> ABOUT A WEEK AGO I STARTED FEELING PRETTY GOOD.\nNO. LOOK, I THINK THE LEARNING CURVE\nALWAYS CONTINUES. THIS IS A REMARKABLE JOB.\nIT IS LIKE NO OTHER JOB ON EARTH.\nAND IT IS A CONSTANT FLOW OF INFORMATION AND CHALLENGES AND\nISSUES. THAT IS TRUER NOW THAN IT HAS\nEVER BEEN. PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF\nINFORMATION AND THE INNER CONNECTION BETWEEN REGIONS OF\nTHE WORLD. YOU KNOW, IF YOU WERE PRESIDENT\n50 YEARS AGO, THE TRAGEDY IN SYRIA MIGHT NOT EVEN PENETRATE\nWHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE THINKING ABOUT ON A DAY TO DAY\nBASIS. TODAY THEY'RE SEEING VIVID\nIMAGES OF A CHILD IN THE AFTERMATH OF A BOMBING.\nTHERE WAS A TIME WHEN IF YOU HAD A FINANCIAL CRISIS IN SOUTHEAST\nAARON IT HAD NO IMPACT ON OUR MARKETS.\nTODAY IT DOES. THE AMOUNT OF INCOMING\nINFORMATION THAT HAS TO DEAL WITH TODAY AND RESPOND MUCH MORE\nRAPIDLY THAN EVER BEFORE. THAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT.\nI WAS WATCHING A DOCUMENTARY THAT DURING THE BAY OF PIGS\nCRISIS JFK HAD TWO WEEKS BEFORE ANYBODY REPORTED ON IT.\nIMAGINE THAT. I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT\nSOMETHING LIKE THAT HAPPENS UNDER A CURRENT PRESIDENT.\nTHEY GOT IT FIGURED OUT IN ABOUT AN HOUR WHAT THEIR RESPONSE IS.\nSO THESE ARE THE KINDS OF POINTS THAT I SHARED WITH THE\nPRESIDENT-ELECT. IT WAS A LONG AND USEFUL\nCONVERSATION. I HOPE IT WAS.\nI TRIED TO BE AS HONEST AS I COULD ABOUT THE THINGS I THINK\nANY PRESIDENT COMING IN NEEDS TO THINK ABOUT.\nPROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT HOW YOU STAFF.\nTHE CHIEF OF STAFF, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER, WHITE HOUSE\nCOUNSEL, HOW YOU SET UP A SYSTEM TOINFORMATION.\nGENERATE OPTIONS FOR A PRESIDENT UNDERSTANDING THAT THE PRESIDENT\nIS GOING TO BE THE FINAL DECISION MAKER.\nTHAT HAS TO BE ATTENDED TO RIGHT AWAY.\nI HAVE BEEN BLESSED AND I AM BIASED BY SOME OF THE SMARTEST,\nHARDEST WORKING, GOOD PEOPLE IN MY ADMINISTRATION THAT ANY\nPRESIDENT HAS EVER HAD. I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE GOOD\nDECISIONS IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT AROUND YOU'LL GET SWAMPED.\nI HOPE THEY APPRECIATE THAT ADVICE.\nWHAT I ALSO DISCUSSED WITH THATT STEPS HE TAKES,THE FIRST\nIMPRESSIONS HE MAKES, THE RESET THAT CAN HAPPEN AFTER AN\nELECTION. ALL THOSE THINGS ARE IMPORTANT\nAND SHOULD BE THOUGHT ABOUT. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO\nGIVE HIM THE ROOM AND THE SPACE TO DO THAT.\nIT TAKES TIME TO PUT THAT TOGETHER.\nBUT I EMPHASIZED TO HIM THAT, LOOK, IN AN ELECTION LIKE THIS\nTHAT WAS SO HOTLY CONTESTED AND SO DIVIDED, GESTURES MATTER AND\nHOW HE REACHES OUT TO GROUPS THAT MAY NOT HAVE SUPPORTED HIM,\nHOW HE SIGNALS HIS INTEREST IN THEIR ISSUES OR CONCERNS, I\nTHINK THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT CAN SET A TONE THAT\nWILL HELP MOVE THINGS FORWARD ONCE HE'S ACTUALLY TAKEN OFFICE.\n>> HOW LONG DID IT TAKE BEFORE YOU WERE AT EASE ON THE JOB?\n>> WELL, I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE TIME TO WORRY ABOUT BEING AT\nEASE BECAUSE, YOU'LL RECALL, WE WERE LOSING AT 800,000 JOBS A\nMONTH. SO THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT IN SOME\nWAYS MY EXPERIENCE IS ATYPICAL. IT'S HARD TO FIND AN ANALOGOUS\nSITUATION. BY THE TIME FDR CAME INTO OFFICE\nTHE DEPRESSION HAD BEEN GOING ON FOR A COUPLE YEARS.\nWE WERE IN THE MIDST OF A  LOCKING UP.\nTHE AUTO INDUSTRY WAS ABOUT TO GO BELLY UP.\nTHE HOUSING MARKET HAD ENTIRELY COLLAPSED.\nSO ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES THAT I HAD WAS THAT I WAS TOO BUSY TO\nWORRY ABOUT HOW ACCLIMATED I WAS FEELING IN THE JOB.\nWE JUST HAD TO MAKE A BUNCH OF DECISIONS.\nIN THIS SITUATION WE'RE TURNING OVER A COUNTRY THAT HAS\nCHALLENGES, HAS PROBLEMS AND OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT\nTHERE WHO ARE FEELING DEEPLY DISEFFECTED, OTHERWISE WE\nWOULDN'T HAVE HAD THE RESULTS THAT WE HAD IN THE ELECTION.\nON THE OTHER HAND, IF YOU LOOK AT THE BASIC INDICATORS OF WHERE\nTHE COUNTRY IS RIGHT NOW, THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS AS LOW AS\nIT'S BEEN IN EIGHT, NINE YEARS. INCOME AND WAGES HAVE BOTH GONE\nUP OVER THE LAST YEAR FASTER THAN THEY HAVE IN A DECADE OR\nTWO. WE GOT HISTORICALLY LOW\nUNINSURED RATES. THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM IS STABLE.\nTHE STOCK MARKET IS HOVERING AROUND ITS ALL-TIME HIGH AND\n401(k)s HAVE BEEN RESTORED. THE HOUSING MARKET HAS\nRECOVERED. WE HAVE CHALLENGES\nINTERNATIONALLY, BUT OUR MOST IMMEDIATE CHALLENGE WITH RESPECT\nTO ISIL, WE'RE SEEING SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN IRAQ AND\nMOSUL IS NOW INCREASINGLY BEING RETAKEN BY IRAQI SECURITY\nFORCES, SUPPORTED BY US. OUR ALLIANCES ARE IN STRONG\nSHAPE. THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE WITH\nRESPECT TO CARBON EMISSIONS HAS BEEN GREATER THAN ANY COUNTRY ON\nEARTH. AND GAS IS TWO BUCKS A GALLON.\nSO HE WILL HAVE TIME AND SPACE, I THINK, TO MAKE JUDICIOUS\nDECISIONS. THE INCOMING ADMINISTRATION\nDOESN'T HAVE TO PUT OUT A HUGE NUMBER OF FIRES.\nTHEY MAY WANT TO TAKE THE COUNTRY IN A SIGNIFICANTLY\nDIFFERENT DIRECTION, BUT THEY'VE GOT TIME TO CONSIDER WHAT\nEXACTLY THEY WANT TO ACHIEVE, AND THAT'S A TESTAMENT TO THE\nTREMENDOUS WORK THAT MY TEAM'S DONE OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS.\nI'M VERY PROUD OF THEM FOR IT. ATHENA JONES.\n>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. YOU SAID MORE THAN ONCE THAT YOU\nDID NOT BELIEVE THAT DONALD TRUMP WOULD EVER BE ELECTED\nPRESIDENT AND THAT YOU THOUGHT HE WAS UNFIT FOR THE OFFICE.\nNOW THAT YOU'VE SPENT TIME WITH HIM, SITTING DOWN AND TALKING\nWITH HIM FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF IN THE OVAL OFFICE, DO YOU NOW\nTHINK THAT PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP IS NOW QUALIFIED TO BE A\nPRESIDENT? AND THE OTHER ONE IS, YOU\nMENTIONED STAFFING AND TONE. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE AMERICANS\nWHO MAY NOT DOUBT THAT THERE WILL BE A PEACEFUL TRANSITION\nBUT THAT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT SOME OF THE POLICIES AND\nSENTIMENT THAT ARE EXPRESSED BY PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP HIMSELF OR\nHIS SUPPORTERS THAT MAY SEEM HOSTILE TO MINORITIES AND\nOTHERS, SPECIFICALLY I'M TALKING ABOUT THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT\nSTEVE BANNON, WHO IS A PROPONENT OF THE ALT-RIGHT MOVEMENT, THE\nWHITE NATIONALS MOVEMENTOVEMENT GOING TO HAVE A PROMINENT ROLE\nIN THE WHITE HOUSE AS THE CHIEF STRATEGIST AND SENIOR ADVISER.\nWHAT MESSAGE DOES THAT SEND TO THE COUNTRY, TO THE WORLD?\n>> OKAY. ATHENA, WITHOUT COMING OUT I\nTHINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT IT WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR ME\nTO COMMENT ON EVERY APPOINTMENT THAT THE PRESIDENT-ELECT STARTS\nMAKING. IF I WANT TO BE CONSISTENT WITH\nTHE NOTION THAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO FACILITATE A SMOOTH\nTRANSITION. THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN.\nDONALD TRUMP WILL BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT, THE 45th PRESIDENT OF\nTHE UNITED STATES. AND IT WILL BE UP TO HIM TO SET\nUP A TEAM THAT HE THINKS WILL SERVE HIM WELL AND REFLECT HIS\nPOLICIES. AND THOSE WHO DIDN'T VOTE FOR\nHIM HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THAT'S HOW DEMOCRACY WORKS.\nTHAT'S HOW THIS SYSTEM OPERATES. WHEN I WON, THERE WERE A NUMBER\nOF PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T LIKE ME AND DIDN'T LIKE WHAT I STOOD FOR. AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT\nWHENEVER YOU GET AN INCOMING PRESIDENT OF THE OTHER SIDE,\nPARTICULARLY IN A BITTER ELECTION LIKE THIS, IT TAKES A\nWHILE FOR PEOPLE TO RECONCILE THEMSELVES WITH THAT NEW\nREALITY. HOPEFULLY IT'S A REMINDER THAT\nELECTIONS MATTER AND VOTING COUNTS.\nAND SO, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES WE HAVE TO\nRELEARN THIS LESSON BECAUSE WE ENDED UP HAVING 43% OF THE\nCOUNTRY NOT VOTING WHO WERE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE.\nBUT IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE. SO GIVEN THAT PRESIDENT-ELECT\nTRUMP IS NOW TRYING TO BALANCE WHAT HE SAID IN THE CAMPAIGN AND\nTHE COMMITMENTS HE MADE TO HIS SUPPORTERS WITH WORKING WITH\nTHOSE WHO DISAGREED WITH HIM AND MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND REACHING\nOUT TO CONSTITUENCIES THAT DIDN'T VOTE FOR HIM, I THINK\nIT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO LET HIM MAKE HIS DECISIONS AND I THINK\nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL JUDGE OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT\nCOUPLE OF YEARS WHETHER THEY LIKE WHAT THEY SAY AND WHETHER\nTHESE ARE THE KINDS OF POLICIES AND THIS IS THE DIRECTION THAT\nTHEY WANT TO SEE THE COUNTRY GOING.\nAND MY ROLE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN I HAND OFF THIS WHITE\nHOUSE, THAT IT IS IN THE BEST POSSIBLE SHAPE AND THAT I'VE\nBEEN AS HELPFUL AS I CAN TO HIM IN GOING FORWARD AND BUILDING ON\nTHE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE. MY ADVICE, AS I SAID TO THE\nPRESIDENT-ELECT WHEN WE HAD OUR DISCUSSIONS WAS THAT CAMPAIGNING\nIS DIFFERENT FROM GOVERNING. I THINK HE RECOGNIZES THAT.\nI THINK HE'S SINCERE IN WANTING TO BE A SUCCESSFUL PRESIDENT.\nAND MOVING IN COUNTRY FORWARD. AND I DON'T THINK ANY PRESIDENT\nEVER COMES IN SAYING TO HIMSELF, I WANT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE\nPEOPLE ANGRY OR ALIENATE HALF THE COUNTRY.\nI THINK HE'S GOING TO TRY AS BEST HE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT HE\nDELIVERS, NOT ONLY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR HIM BUT FOR\nTHE PEOPLE AT LARGE. AND THE GOOD THING IS THAT THERE\nARE GOING TO BE ELECTIONS COMING UP SO THERE'S A BIT-IN INCENT I\nFOR HIM TO TRY TO DO THAT. BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S ONLY BEEN\nSIX DAYS AND I THINK IT WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO -- TO HAVE\nTHE ROOM TO STAFF UP, TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HIS PRIORITIES ARE, TO\nBE ABLE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN WHAT HE WAS CAMPAIGNING ON AND\nWHAT IS PRACTICAL, WHAT HE CAN ACTUALLY ACHIEVE.\nYOU KNOW, THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT MAKE FOR GOOD SOUND\nBITES BUT DON'T ALWAYS TRANSLATE INTO GOOD POLICY.\nAND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HE AND HIS TEAM I THINK WILL WRESTLE\nWITH IN THE SAME WAY THAT EVERY PRESIDENT WRESTLES WITH.\nI DID SAY TO HIM, AS I'VE SAID PUBLICLY, THAT BECAUSE OF THE\nNATURE OF THE CAMPAIGNS AND THE BITTERNESS AND VERACITY OF THE\nCAMPAIGNS, THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO TRY TO SEND SOME\nSIGNALS OF UNITY AND TO REACH OUT TO MINORITY GROUPS OR WOMEN\nOR OTHERS THAT WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE TENOR OF THE CAMPAIGN.\nAND I THINK, YOU KNOW, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HE WILL -- HE\nWILL WANT TO DO, BUT THIS IS ALL HAPPENING A LITTLE FAST.\nHE'S GOT COMMITMENTS TO SUPPORTERS THAT HELPED TO GET\nHIM HERE AND HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BALANCE THOSE.\nAND OVER THE COMING WEEKS AND MONTHS AND YEARS, MY HOPE IS\nTHAT THOSE IMPULSES ULTIMATELY WIN OUT.\nBUT TOO EARLY TO START MAKING JUDGMENTS ON THAT.\n>> HAS THAT CHANGED AFTER MEETING WITH HIM?\n>> I THINK THAT HE SUCCESSFULLY MOBILIZED A BIG CHUNK OF THE\nCOUNTRY TO VOTE FOR HIM AND HE'S GOING TO WIN.\nHE HAS WON. HE'S GOING TO BE THE NEXT\nPRESIDENT. AND REGARDLESS OF WHAT\nEXPERIENCE OR ASSUMPTIONS HE BROUGHT TO THE OFFICE, THIS\nOFFICE HAS A WAY OF WAKING YOU UP.\nAND THOSE -- THOSE ASPECTS OF HIS POSITIONS OR PREDISPOSITIONS\nTHAT DON'T MATCHUP WITH REALITY, HE WILL FIND SHAKEN UP PRETTY\nQUICK BECAUSE REALITY HAS A WAY OF ASSERTING ITSELF.\nAND SOME OF HIS GIFTS THAT OBVIOUSLY ALLOWED HIM TO EXECUTE\nONE OF THE BIGGEST POLITICAL UPSETS IN HISTORY, THOSE ARE\nONES THAT HOPEFULLY HE WILL PUT TO GOOD USE ON BEHALF OF ALL THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE.

WHILE U.S. AND ALLIES ARE MAKING\nPROGRESS AGAINST ISIS, IT WILL BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT'S JOB TO\nFINISH THE FIGHT. WE CERTAINLY EMPATHIZED WITH\nWHAT HAPPENED IN PARIS AND WHEN THAT TOOK PLACE LAST YEAR, THE\nBIG QUESTION FOR ALL OF US IS IS THAT GOING TO HAPPEN HERE.\nON THE TOP OF THE LIST FOR THE NEXT PRESIDENT, HOW DO YOU KEEP\nOUR COUNTRY SAFE? >> WELL, TWO WAYS, ONE IS HAVING\nTHE BEST DEFENSE WE CAN POSSIBLY THAT.\nINTELLIGENCE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE MUCH\nCONNECTED TISSUE THAT WE CAN HAVE WITH COMMUNITIES WITH\nTERRORISTS MOSTLY COME OUT OF IS IMPORTANT FOR US AND THE PEOPLE\nIN THOSE COMMUNITIES TO BE EYES AND EARS AND HAVE GREAT FEDERAL\nBUREAU OF INVESTIGATION, GOOD DEFENSE, WE HAVE A GOOD DEFENSE,\nCOULD IT BE BETTER, ALWAYS.

HE MAY NOT KNOW WHAT IT IS TO DO\nAND I DON'T THINK HE NEEDS TO KNOW THAT.\nMOST PRESIDENTS WHO COME INTO OFFICE DO NOT HAVE A LOT OF\nFOREIGN POLICY XERPS.

WHAT IS IT AND WHY IS IT\nIMPORTANT AND WHY DO YOU THINK THAT MIGHT BE THE BIGGEST STORY\nOF 2017? >> THAT WILL BE A HEADLINE IN\n2011. THE SECURITY SITUATION IS\nWORSENING AND IT'S OFF THE RADAR, THE TENSION ON THE\nELECTION TO BE CERTAIN, I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.\nISIS IS ANOTHER THING BUT WHAT IS HAPPENING THERE IS THEY HAVE\nREEMERGED AND NEW COMMITMENT AND RESOLVE AND THEY ALSO BELIEVE\nTHAT THE UNITED STATES IS NO LONGER FULLY COMMITTED, AS A\nRESULT OF THAT, JENNA, THEY ARE NOW IN CONTROL OF MORE TERRITORY\nTHAN THEY HAVE EVER BEEN SINCE THEY RAN THE COUNTRY IN 2001.\nTHAT IS STAGGERING GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE HAVE BEEN THERE FOR\n15 YEARS TRYING TO HELP THE BEGAN SECURITY FORCES.\nTHE BEGAN SECURITY FORCES DUE TO POLICY DECISIONS MADE BY OUR\nPRESIDENT, WE WERE NEVER ABLE TO GIVE RESOURCES TO ASSIST THEM TO\nTHE DEGREE THAT WE WANTED AND WE PULLED OUR FORCES OUT MUCH TOO\nEARLY, COMBAT FORCES. WE HAVE TEN THOUSAND THERE BUT\nIT'S NOT ENOUGH. THE SECOND THING IS AND THIS IS\nHORRIFIC, THERE ARE TWO TALIBAN SANCTUARIES IN PAKISTAN, THE\nPAKISTAN MILITARY PROTECTS THOSE SANCTUARY, NOT ONLY THAT, THEY\nGIVE THEM INFORMATION ON OUR OPERATIONS AND PAKISTANIS ARE AN\nALLY, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN INSURGENCY WHO HAS BEEN DEFEATED\nTHAT ENJOYED SANCTUARY THAT WAS OUTSIDE OF THE COMBAT AREA.\n>> WHAT'S THE RISK OF THAT AT HOME BECAUSE OF THAT?\n>> ISIS IS GROWING IN AFGHANISTAN.\nTALIBAN HAVE NO INTEREST IN BEING OUT OF REGION\nORGANIZATION, BUT IF YOU TURN AFGHANISTAN INTO A RADICAL\nISLAMIC STATE, IT WILL BE A BREEDING GROUND FOR PEOPLE WHO\nARE GOING TO NOT ONLY CONDUCT TERRORIST OPERATIONS IN THE\nREGION BUT WILL CONDUCT IN EUROPE AND ALSO IN THE UNITED\nSTATES. WE CANNOT LET IT HAPPEN.\nJENNA: INTERESTING, WE ARE SO FOCUSED ON SYRIA BECOME ISLAMIC\nSTATE BUT PERHAPS IT'S AFGHANISTAN, AND THAT'S\nSOMETHING WE WILL BE WATCHING.

GOOD EVENING AND WELCOME TO THE\nKELLY FILE, I'M MEGYN KELLY. THE FALLOUT CONTINUES AFTER MR.\nTRUMP ANNOUNCED THAT TWO OF THE MEN THAT HELPED GUIDE HIS\nCAMPAIGN WILL BE HIS CLOSEST CONFIDANT INSIDE THE WALLS OF\n1600 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE. REINCE PRIEBUS, THE NATIONAL\nCOMMITTEE CHAIRMAN WILL BECOME MR. TRUMP'S CHIEF OF STAFF.\nAND STEVE BANNON, THE FORMER EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF BREITBART\nNEWS WILL BECOME MR.

FORMER NAVAL OFFICE BROUGHT\nCONFIDENCE TO THE CAMPAIGN, BUT IT WAS UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP THAT\nBREITBART THE CONSERVATIVE WEBSITE BEGAN TO APPEAL TO THE\nSO-CALLED ALT-RIGHT. EXCORIATING BILL CRYSTAL AS A\nRENEGADE JEW AND BIRTH CONTROL MAKES WOMEN UNATTRACTIVE AND\nCRAZY.

SO I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THESE\nTHINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE CRYING OUT ABOUT.\nBUT LOOK, IT'S A GOOD TEAM. I THINK IF PEOPLE SAW THE LAST\nFEW MONTHS IN THE CAMPAIGN, IT WORKED VERY WELL.\n>> TRUMP ADVISOR KELLYANNE CONWAY TOLD REPORTERS AT TRUMP\nTODAY TOWER THAT PRIEBUS AND BANNON COMPLIMENT EACH OTHER\nADDING THEY BOTH HAVE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING, THE EAR OF THE\nBOSS, MEGYN. >> JAMES, GREAT TO SEE YOU.\nJOINING US ON THIS AND THE REST OF THE WHITE HOUSE TRANSITION,\nNEWT GINGRICH, FORMER REPUBLICAN SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE AND\nCO-AUTHOR OF THE NEW BOOK \"REDISCOVERING GOD IN AMERICA.\"\nI JUST SAW \"TREASON\" IN THE AIRPORT TODAY.\nI CAN'T KEEP UP. >> THANK YOU.\n>> HE IS THE PRESIDENT AND CEO AND HE WORKED WITH BANNON.\nON MR. BANNON. I'VE READ A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT\nHIM. HIS DETRACTORS SAY HE PUSHES A\nRACIST, MASSAGE NIS AGENDA, BUT WHAT IS THE ACTUAL EVIDENCE OF\nTHAT? >> WELL, I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT\nTHE LITANY OF HEADLINES THAT HAVE RUN ACROSS BREITBART NEWS\nFOR THE LAST TWO YEARS, HEADLINES ABOUT WOMEN SHOULDN'T\nBE REPORTING IN TECH. WOMEN IN THE BIRTH CONTROL ISSUE\nWITH PLANNED PARENTHOOD. YOU SEE AN AGENDA FORM.\n>> BUT YOU KNOW HIS DEFENDERS WOULD SAY, HE'S NOT RESPONSIBLE\nFOR EVERY HEADLINE THAT GOES ON BREITBART AND HE DIDN'T WRITE\nTHOSE PIECES. >> WHEN YOU'RE AT THE TOP OF THE\nORDINANCES, WHAT HAPPENS BELOW THEM AND IT HAPPENS FREQUENTLY,\nYOU HAVE TWO CHOICES, ADDRESS IT AND SHOULDN'T SHOULDN'T BE DOING\nIT OR YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING AND YOU'RE SAYING THAT.\n>> HOW LONG? >> TWO YEARS.\nWHAT WAS YOUR EXPERIENCE? >> MY EXPERIENCE THERE WAS THERE\nWERE NO ISSUES AT ALL WHEN HEADLINES LIKE THAT WHEN RUN\nWHEN MEDIA INQUIRIES ASKED WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THESE THINGS.\nTHERE WAS NEVER ANY TYPE OF RETRACTION, WALKING BACK,\nCONCESSION THAT MAYBE THEY WENT TOO FAR WITH THE STUFF.\nTHEY WERE VERY HAPPY WHEN THEY GOT THAT KIND OF ATTENTION.\n>> DO YOU BELIEVE HE BELIEVES IN THOSE PRINCIPLES IF YOU WILL OR\nDO YOU BELIEVE HE IS JUST A PROROCK IS OR IT?\n>> I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH.\nI MEAN, WHEN YOU LOOK OUT HIS PLAN PUT INTO ACTION DURING THE\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN, IT'S NOT LIKE THEY RAN AWAY FROM THOSE THEMES\nWITH, THEY EMBRACED THEM. THEY PLAYED OFF OF THEM.\nIT'S BEEN A RECIPE SO FAR, EVIDENCE THAT TRUMP'S NET WHITE\nHOUSE RIGHT NOW AND STEVE IS IN THIS HIGH PROFILE CO-CHIEF OF\nSTAFF ROLE. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,\nACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN ANYTHING.\nTHE ACTIONS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES.\n>> STEVE BANNON OBVIOUSLY TRUMP CONTROL HIMSELF.\nI THINK WE'VE SEEN THAT TRUMP ANSWERS TO NO MAN OR WOMAN.\nHE CONTROLS HIS OWN APPROACH. BUT STEVE BAN DENY SORT OF CALL\nTHE POSSIBILITY OF A DONALD TRUMP AS EARLY AS 2010.\nLISTEN TO THIS, IN 2010, AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE\nFUTURE HOLDS. HE SAID IT'S GOING TO BE AN\nINSURGENT, CENTER RIGHT POPULIST MOVEMENT THAT IS -- TOUGH WORD,\nANTI-ESTABLISHMENT, AND IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAMMER THIS\nCITY, WASHINGTON, BOTH THE PROGRESSIVE LEFT AND THE\nINSTITUTIONAL REPUBLICAN PARTY. THAT WAS 2010.\n>> YEAH, RIGHT AFTER THE TEA PARTY.\n>> WE CAN SEE WHY TRUMP WAS ATTRACTED TO HIM.\n>> THEY'RE MADE FOR EACH OTHER. YOU HAVE TWO PEOPLE WHO ARE PROVOCATIVES.\nWHO HAVE THE STATUS QUO IN WASHINGTON.\nTRUMP, STEVE FOUND THE FIRST POLITICAL FIGURE TO SYMBOLIZE\nTHAT THAT HE CAN MARTIAL HIS PLATFORM AROUND AND STEVE, TRUMP\nFOUND AN AUDIENCE THAT EXISTED FOR THAT MESSAGE.\nTHEY'RE A PERFECT MATCH. >> DO YOU THINK THAT STEVE\nBANNON THAT THOSE KINDS OF COMMENTS WOULD BE PUSHED AS AN\nAGENDA? YOU KNOW, AN ANTI-WOMAN,\nANTI-MINORITY, ANTI-GAY AGENDA. TRUMP CERTAINLY -- WELL, YOU\nTELL ME. >> WELL, I THINK IT'S AN AGENDA.\nI THINK ANY TIME YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING AS FREQUENTLY AS THEY\nHAVE BEEN WITH THE AUDIENCE AND THE SIZE THAT THEY HAVE, AND THE\nPROFILE THAT THEY'VE BUILT OFF OF THAT, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU\nCAN SAY ANYTHING ELSE OTHER THAN THAT'S CLEARLY AN AGENDA.\n>> HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL IF YOU FEEL THAT WAY AND YOU\nWORK CLOSELY WITH HIM. >> THAT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY\nI LEFT. PUBLICLY BACK IN MARCH I SAID I\nCOULD NOT BE A PART OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS ANYMORE.\nAND I BELIEVE WHEN YOU CAN'T DO YOUR JOB HONESTLY AND TO THE\nBEST OF YOUR ABILITY, THAT'S WHEN IT'S TIME TO WALK AWAY.\nAND THAT'S WHY I DID. >> ARE YOU WORRIED NOW BEING ON\nTHE OPPOSITE SIDE OF BANNON? >> NO.\nI MEAN FIRST OF ALL, IF STEVE BANNON IS A CO-WHITE HOUSE CHIEF\nOF STAFF GO AFTER MY LIFE. THAT'S CONCERNING ALL TO ITSELF,\nBUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, I THINK THAT HE HAS BIGGER FISH TO\nFRY. >> KURT, GREAT TO SEE YOU.\n>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON. >> NOW NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER\nREPUBLICAN SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE. GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK.\n>> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU. >> YOU'VE HEARD THE REPORTS AND\nTHE STEVE BANNON AND I'LL SHOW THE VIEWERS THE HEADLINES.\nYOU KNOW, HE DIDN'T WRITE THESE, BUT HE WAS THE EXECUTIVE\nCHAIRMAN OF BREITBART WHENNEN SOME WENT UP.\nSHE CALLED, NOT HE, BREITBART REFERRED TO BILL CRYSTAL AS A\nRENEGADE JEW. WOMEN SHOULD LOG OFF WITH\nANOTHER ONE. HERE'S A COUPLE MORE.\nSTAND BY. BIRTH CONTROL MAKES WOMEN\nUNATTRACTIVE AND CRAZY. WOULD YOU RATHER YOUR CHILD HAD\nFEMINISM OR CANCER? AND THEN THERE WAS THESE\nCHESTNUTS, GAY RIGHTS HAVE MADE US DUMBER.\nFAT SHAMING WORKS. THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF\nHEADLINES. >> FIRST OF ALL, THERE'S A BIG\nDIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE KIND OF STUFF THEY DID AT BREITBART.\n>> QUICKLY -- >> TIGHT END,ING HIMSELF DOING\nIT. BANNON IS A VERY SERIOUS GUY.\nWE KNOW HIM WELL. HE IS VERY DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT\nWASHINGTON HAS GROWN CORRUPT. HE FEELS THOSE THINGS DEEPLY.\nHE'S ALSO AN OFFICER THAT PLAYED THAT COUNTRY PATRIOTICALLY.\nPUT HIM IN AS THE CAYLY COORDINATOR AS CHIEF OF STAFF,\nBUT THEN HE SAID LOOK, I WANT A GUY WHO'S GOING TO THINK ABOUT\nTHE FIGHTS WE'RE GOING TO BE IN AND HE'S GOING TO BE\nENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THOSE FIGHTS. AND HE GAVE -- IN SOME WAYS I\nTHINK ENDED UP GIVING BANNON THE EQUIVALENT OF THE CARL ROVE JOB\nOR THE AXELROD JOB IN PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS.\n>> THAT'S WHAT BANNON SAID, HE'S A FIGHTER.\nAND HE LIKED TO BUFF UP WASHINGTON, HE DOESN'T LIKE THE\nESTABLISHMENT. THAT'S WHAT TRUMP IS.\nA LOT OF TRUMP'S VOTERS AND SUPPORTERS WANT.\nNOW LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THE NEWS ON CAB GNAT APPOINTMENTS.\nTONIGHT, RUDY GIULIANI IS THE FAVORITE, THEY'RE SAYING THE\nFAVORITE FOR SECRETARY OF STATE. DO YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON\nTHAT? >> I HAVE NO INFORMATION, BUT IF\nRUDY WANTS IT, HE'LL GET IT. RUDY HAS BEEN THE CLOSEST\nSURROGATE, HE AND SENATOR SESSIONS HAVE BEEN THE TWO\nCLOSEST TO PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP.\nHE HAS DONE A GREAT JOB. HE HAS WORKED HIS HEART OUT.\nI THOUGHT HE MIGHT PREFER ATTORNEY GENERAL WHERE HE WOULD\nBE BRILLIANT OR HOMELAND SECURITY WHERE HIS EXPERIENCE AT\n9/11 WILL BE GREAT. I THINK HE'LL BE FABULOUS TO\nHAVE HIM AS SECRETARY OF STATE. HE'S ALREADY KNOWN WORLDWIDE.\nHE IS A GREAT MANAGER. AND HE WOULD DO A LOT BOTH TO\nREPRESENT AMERICA, WHICH IS WHAT WE NEED, AND TO REFORM THE STATE\nDEPARTMENT. WHICH WE NEED.\nI'D BE ENTHUSE YAESIC IF HE PICKS RUDY.\n>> SOME ARE SAYING JEFF SESSIONS AND LAURA INGRAM MAY BE UNDER\nCONSIDERATION FOR PRESS SECRETARY AND ANOTHER POSITION,\nSHE'S DOWN ON TUCKER CARLSON'S SHOW.\nNSA AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, MR. SPEAKER?\nARE YOU BEING CONSIDERED FOR A POSITION AND IS THERE ONE YOU\nHAVE YOUR EYE ON? >> WELL, I WANT TO BE THE\nGENERAL PLANNER LOOKING OUT OVER THE NEXT EIGHT YEARS AND TRYING\nTO DESIGN HOW WE FUNDAMENTALLY RESHAPE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.\nAND THAT'S A VERY BROAD JOB. THE CLOSEST ANALOGY PROBABLY IS\nHARRY HOPKINS AND THE WORK HE DID FOR FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT.\nFIRST ABOUT SESSIONS, SENATOR SESSIONS WAS THE MOST LOYAL, THE\nEARLIEST SUPPORTER OF TRUMP IN WASHINGTON.\nHE WOULD BE A GREAT AS ATTORNEY GENERAL BECAUSE HE SPENT 13\nYEARS IN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, AND WAS ATTORNEY GENERAL OF\nALABAMA. HE WOULD ALSO BE TREMENDOUS AT\nTHE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE. I WOULD BE VERY ENTHUSIASTIC\nWHATEVER HE AND THE PRESIDENT-ELECT DECIDE.\n>> NOW, TRUMP IS GETTING HIT TONIGHT IN SOME CORNERS BECAUSE\nHE IS ASKING FOR TOP SECRET CLEARANCE FOR HIS CHILDREN IN\nTHE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. AND THE CONFLICT HIS DETRACTORS\nSAY IS THAT HE HAS SAID HIS ADULT CHILDREN ARE RUNNING THE\nTRUMP ORGANIZATION AND IT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE OR WRONG TO\nHAVE THEM MAINTAIN THIS ACTIVE BUSINESS INTEREST WITH\nINTERNATIONAL TIES, AND BOTH HAVE ACCESS TO TOP SECRET\nINFORMATION. IS THAT -- DO THEY HAVE A POINT?\n>> LOOK, I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW HILLARY CLINTON", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1479179818259.1479175967716.38bff08c-a2c1-4ffe-847e-96c3ed1e2fe8.segment6.thumb.jpg", "channel": "360"}, {"start": 0, "length": 25478.0, "end": 25478, "date": 1479192247063, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1479194793044.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1479192231818-843a655b-4627-4f44-80fd-1259d3b90dad-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=0.00,25.48", "text": "HAVE TO DO, I THINK IN A LOT OF\nCASES HE TAKES ADVICE BUT HE LIKES TO LISTEN THE A LOT OF\nPEOPLE.

AND THEY NOW WANT TO COME\nBACK AND SAY ANYTHING ANYBODY EVER PUBLISHED ON\nBREITBART IS STEVE BANNON. THAT'S BOLOGNA.\n>> AND WE'RE BACK WITH THE PANEL.\nCHARLES, THOUGHTS? >> LOOK, I HEAR THE CHARGE\nOF THE MAN IS AN ANTI-SEMITE.\nI FIND IT RATHER IMPLAUSIBLE THAT A PRESIDENT-ELECT WOULD\nAPPOINT AS HIS SENIOR STRATEGIST AN ANTI-SEMITE\nWHEN HIS DAUGHTER IS JEWISH, HER HUSBAND IS CLOSEST\nADVISOR IS JEWISH, AND THEIR CHILDREN, HIS GRANDCHILDREN\nARE JEWISH. SO I DON'T THINK HE IS\nSENDING A SIGNAL ABOUT THAT. WHAT I THINK HE IS -- THE\nPROBLEM HERE IS THAT HE MAY BE MORE TOLERANT OF THIS\nKIND OF DEVIANCE IF YOU LIKE, LIKE STEPPING SOMEWHAT\nBEYOND THE LINES OF THE ACCEPTABLE THAN WHAT IS\nNORMAL. WILLIAM BUCKLEY WAS ABLE TO\nREVITALIZE CONSERVATISM OR, IN FACT, TO GIVE IT LIFE\nWHEN HE BANISHED THE JOHN BIRD SOCIETY.\nWHICH IS IN SOME WAY THE SORT OF AT LEAST THE ANALOG\nWAY BACK IN THE 1950S TO SOME OF THE ALT RIGHT.\nI THINK IT'S INSENSITIVE FOR TRUMP TO HAVE MADE E IS KIND\nOF APPOINTMENT WITHOUT CONSIDERING THAT BUT IN THE\nEND IT WILL DEPEND ON WHAT HE DOES.\nRIGHT NOW IT LOOKS AS IF PRIEBUS IS GOING TO BE THE\nMAN IN CHARGE. WE WILL SEE WHO IN THE END\nIS GOING TO HAVE THE YOU WERE HAND AND WE WILL ALSO\nSEE IF BANNON, WHO WILL OBVIOUSLY APPEAR ON\nTELEVISION AND OTHER PLACES SPEAKS IN A WAY THAT\nJUSTIFIES THE WAY HE IS BEING CARICATURED TONIGHT.\nI WOULD SAY WHAT OBAMA IS SAYING, GIVE HIM ROOM WITH\nHIS APPOINTMENTS AND WE WILL JUDGE THEM BY THEIR ACTIONS.\n>> CLEARLY THE PRESIDENT-ELECT IS TRYING TO\nRECREATE THE MAGIC, IF YOU WILL, OF HIS CAMPAIGN.\nTHAT ENDED UP WITH A WINNING STRATEGY AT THE END THERE,\nCAITLIN. AND, PERHAPS, PROVIDING SOME\nCOVER FOR AN ESTABLISHMENT CHOICE AS CHIEF OF STAFF.\n>> RIGHT, CONTACT EXACTLY. IS HE GOING TO GET SOME PUSH\nBACK ROGER STONE TWEETED EARLIER BEFORE THIS\nANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE THAT THERE WOULD BE BACKLASH TO\nPRIEBUS BECAUSE IS HE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE\nESTABLISHMENT. AT THE SAME TIME THESE ARE\nTWO PEOPLE THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO KIND OF BALANCE EACH\nOTHER OUT IN A WAY. THE STATEMENT THAT THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN -- THAT PRESIDENT-ELECT, THE TEAM\nRELEASED SAID THEY WOULD BE KIND OF EQUAL PARTNERS.\nAND SO THOSE WHO ARE OPPOSED TO BANNON, I THINK WILL LOOK\nFOR A PARTNER IN PRIEBUS. AND THOSE WHO THINK THAT\nPRIEBUS IS REPRESENTATIVE OF EVERYTHING WRONG IN\nWASHINGTON WILL LOOK TO BANNON.\nI DO THINK THOUGH THAT IT -- THAT BANNON HISTORY, THAT\nWHAT HIS SITE PUBLISHED UNDER HIS TENURE IS\nTROUBLING TO DEMOCRATS BUT ALSO REPUBLICANS.\nAND PARTICULARLY SINCE BANNON HAD GONE SO PUBLICLY\nAFTER PAUL RYAN. I THINK PAUL RYAN WILL SEEK\nTHAT PARTNERSHIP IN PRIEBUS. THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT\nREPUBLICANS STILL ABOUT THAT CHOICE AS WELL.\n>> CHARLES? >> I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE\nMOST INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT THIS ELECTION HAS BEEN\nWHAT HAS HAPPENED TO POLITICAL LANGUAGE.\nAND OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF WHAT WE HAVE HEARD IN THE PAST 18\nMONTHS HAS BEEN SHOCKING. A LOT OF IT HAS BEEN IN\nPOLITIC. BUT POLITICAL CORRECTNESS\nHAS TAKEN A HUGE BLOW IN WERE POLITICS.\nCERTAINLY THE BREITBART IS PERFECT EXAMPLE, STEVE\nBANNON EXAMPLE OF THAT HE CHARGES FOR THE GATES.\n THAT BEING ANTI-SEMITIC OR RACIST IS\nABSURD. I THINK THESE PEOPLE, THEY\nDO A GREAT DISCREDIT TO THEMSELVES BY CHEAPENING\nRACISM, CHEAPENING ANTISEMITISM BY ACCUSING\nTHESE PEOPLE OF THAT BECAUSE IT'S JUST RIDICULOUS.\n>> PANEL, THANK YOU.

BANNON WAS THE CAMPAIGN CEO AND\nCHAIRMAN OF BREITBART NEWS. HE'S CALLED BREITBART NEWS A\nPLATFORM OF THE ALT-RIGHT WHICH IS WIDELY SEEN AS CLOSELY\nALIGNED WITH WHITE NATIONALISM, ANTISEMITISM AND MYSOGENY.\nNOT SURPRISINGLY, A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY\nABOUT THIS. JOINING ME IS CNN SENIOR\nPOLITICAL REPORTER MANU RAJU AND RNC MEMBER RANDY EVANS, WHO IS\nCLOSE WITH REINCE PRIEBUS. MANU, FIRST TO YOU.\nREPUBLICANS, VERY QUICK TO SAY THEY WERE VERY HAPPY TO SEE\nREINCE PRIEBUS BEING APPOINTED CHIEF OF STAFF.\nIT SEEMED THERE WAS BY AND LARGE SILENCE, THOUGH, ABOUT STEVE\nBANNON. WHAT IS THE REACTION?\n>> YEAH, THAT'S EXACTLY IT AMONG REPUBLICANS, SILENCE.\nTHEY DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF THE FACT STEVE BANNON\nBEING IN THAT POSITION. THEY REALLY DON'T KNOW MUCH\nABOUT STEVE BANNON, TO BEGIN WITH, OTHER THAN THE FACT HE WAS\nTHE HEAD OF BREITBART NEWS AND THAT BREITBART HAS FURIOUSLY\nATTACKED REPUBLICANS ON CAPITOL HILL, PARTICULARLY THE\nLEADERSHIP, FOR A LONG TIME, FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS, GOING\nAFTER LINDSEY GRAHAM FOR HIS WORK ON IMMIGRATION, GOING AFTER\nPAUL RYAN, TRYING TO ACTUALLY BEAT HIM IN HIS PRIMARY\nCHALLENGE BACK LAST AUGUST, THE ONE PAUL RYAN WON\nOVERWHELMINGLY. A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT EXACTLY\nTHE AMOUNT OF INFLUENCE HE WILL HAVE.\nWILL HE PULL DONALD TRUMP FURTHER TO THE RIGHT OR WILL HE\nBE AS REINCE PRIEBUS SAID MORE OF AN OPERATIONAL,\nORGANIZATIONAL PERSON WITH AN EVEN-KEELED TEMPERAMENT.\nIT SPEAKS TO THE LARGER QUESTION REPUBLICANS HAVE ABOUT WHAT\nDONALD TRUMP WILL BE LIKE AS PRESIDENT.\nBUT DEMOCRATS ARE JUMPING ALL OVER THIS.\nHARRY REID, THE SENATE MINORITY LEADER, HIS SPOKESMAN ISSUING A\nSCATHING STATEMENT LAST NIGHT SAYING THAT IT'S EASY TO SEE WHY\nTHE KKK VIEWS TRUMP AS THEIR CHAMPION WHEN TRUMP APPOINTS WON\nOF THE FOREMOST PEDDLERS OF WHITE SUPREMACIST THEMES AND\nRHETORIC AS HIS TOP AIDE. SO VERY VERY STRONG WORDS FROM\nDEMOCRATS. REPUBLICANS UNCERTAIN, THOUGH.\n>> IT SURE SEEMS THE CASE. ONE PERSON COMING TO THE DEFENSE\nOF STEVE BANNON IS REINCE PRIEBUS.\nHERE HE WAS ON ABC THIS MORNING. LISTEN TO THIS.\n>> I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY'RE COMING FROM.\nTHAT'S NOT THE STEVE BANNON THAT I KNOW.\nI HAVE SAT WITH HIM FOR MONTHS. I HAVE NEVER, EVER ONE TIME\nEXPERIENCED THAT AND -- >> THEY ARE LOOKING AT THE\nBREITBART WEBSITE. >> I THINK THERE WILL BE A LOT\nOF ANNOUNCEMENTS OF A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT I FIND HIM NOT TO BE\nTHE WAY THAT HE IS BEING ACCUSED.\nI FIND HIM TO BE THE OPPOSITE. I THINK PEOPLE NEED TO GIVE\nPEOPLE TIME AND GIVE PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY AND NOT MAKE\nJUDGMENTS. >> RANDY, YOU TRUST REINCE\nPRIEBUS. DO YOU TRUST STEVE BANNON?\n>> OH, ABSOLUTELY. I'M NOT SURPRISED DEMOCRATS\nWOULD BE OVERLY CRITICAL OF THE CHIEF STRATEGIST THAT BEAT THEM\nIN THE ELECTION. THE BIGGEST ASSET STEVE BANNON\nBRINGS TO BEAR IS HE'S ACTUALLY IN TOUCH WITH A MAJORITY OF THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE AND IT SCARES BOTH ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS\nAND DEMOCRATS BECAUSE IT MEANS HE LOOKS PAST THE ESTABLISHMENT\nTHAT'S IN WASHINGTON, D.C. >> RIGHT, BUT RANDY, WHEN YOU\nSAY MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AGREE WITH BIRTH CONTROL\nMAKES WOMEN UNATTRACTIVE AND CRAZY?\nTHESE ARE HEADLINES FROM BREITBART NEWS.\nBILL KRISTOL, REPUBLICAN SPOILER, RENEGADE JEW?\nYOU CAN SEE THE HEADLINES ON THE SCREEN RIGHT NOW.\nYOU THINK A MAJORITY OF AMERICA AGREES WITH THIS?\nI THINK THAT'S NOT RIGHT. >> NO, I THINK WHAT YOU ARE\nDOING IS YOU ARE READING FROM THE TALKING POINTS OF THE\nDEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE WHICH IS TO SAY --\n>> NO, I'M ABSOLUTELY NOT. NO.\nHE'S THE HEAD OF BREITBART NEWS. >> YOU SPENT AN ENTIRE 15\nMINUTES EXPLAINING WHY DONALD TRUMP WAS HORRIBLE AND IS GOING\nTO FAIL. YOU SAID, YOU AMONG OTHER\nPEOPLE, SAID HE NEEDS TO BE MORE PRESIDENTIAL.\nWHEN HE'S MORE PRESIDENTIAL, THAT'S HIM WEAKENING AND BACKING\nOFF. >> I NEVER ONCE SAID HE FAILED\nIN THE 24 MINUTES I HAVE BEEN ON TV TODAY.\n>> YOU HAVE SAID, YOU CRITICIZE FOR THE SOFTENING, YOU GO HE'S\nSOFTENING, HOW CAN HE KEEP HIS BASE.\nIN TERMS OF DELIVERING, WHAT ABOUT GUANTANAMO?\nWHAT ABOUT PROSECUTING FOR WAR CRIMES?\n>> ABSOLUTELY. WE JUST BROUGHT THAT UP IN OUR\nDISCUSSION. THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME.\nI'M ASKING ABOUT HIS SOENIOR ADVISER AND YOU SAYING MAJORITY\nOF AMERICANS AGREE WITH IT. YOU HAVE NO PROBLEMS WITH WHAT\nSTEVE BANNON'S WEBSITE -- >> PLAY THE TAPE BACK.\nTHAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID. STEVE BANNON HAS A CONNECTION\nWITH WHAT AMERICAN -- AVERAGE AMERICANS THINK.\nI DIDN'T SAY EVERY BREITBART HEADLINE REFLECTED THOSE BELIEFS\nOF THE AVERAGE AMERICAN. YOU SAID THAT.\nNOT ME. WHAT I SAID WAS AS A CHIEF\nSTRATEGIST LIKE KARL ROVE, LIKE DAVID AXELROD, THEY HAVE AN\nUNDERSTANDING OF EXACTLY HOW THE PEOPLE FEEL.\nNOW, THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN. WE IN THE MEDIA CAN EITHER TAKE\nA STEP BACK AND SAY OKAY, WHAT DID HE HEAR THAT WE DIDN'T AND\nMAYBE WE NEED TO TAKE A LONG LOOK AT WHAT THAT IS.\nREINCE PRIEBUS HAS WORKED WITH HIM.\nREINCE PRIEBUS IS A PHENOMENAL LEADER AT BRINGING FACTIONS\nTOGETHER. RATHER THAN ALWAYS DIVIDING.\nREMEMBER, HE STARTED THIS PROCESS WITH 17 PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATES. >> ABSOLUTELY.\n>> AND WAS ABLE AT THE END OF THE DAY TO BRING EVERYBODY\nTOGETHER TO A VICTORY. THIS IS A MAN WHO ASSIMILATED A\nGROUND GAME WHICH DAY AFTER DAY WAS CRITICIZED AS BEING NOT\nCOMPETITIVE WITH THE CLINTON GROUND GAME, WHEREAS THE REINCE\nPRIEBUS GROUND GAME PUMMELED THEM.\nPUMMELED THEM IN STATES LIKE NORTH CAROLINA AND IN IOWA AND\nIN WISCONSIN AND IN MICHIGAN. >> AND IT IS LARGELY REINCE\nPRIEBUS AND THE OPERATION THAT HE'S BUILT UP AND THE\nORGANIZATION THAT HELPED DONALD TRUMP.\n>> YOU CAN HAVE THE BEST GROUND OPERATION IN THE WORLD BUT IF\nYOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT MESSAGE IT DOESN'T WORK.\nYOU HAVE TO HAVE BOTH THE MESSAGING AND THE GROUND GAME\nTHAT'S FEEDING OFF OF EACH OTHER.\nTHAT'S WHY YOU HAVE A PERFECT COMBINATION.\n>> RANDY? >> YOU HAVE SOMEBODY AS THE\nCHIEF STRATEGIST WHO HAS THE MESSAGING.\nYOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS THE GROUND GAME WHO IS THERE TO PUT\nIT IN PLACE. >> WHEN YOU DO HAVE THE\nANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE COMING OUT REACTING TO STEVE BANNON\nSAYING IT IS A SAD DAY WHEN A MAN WHO PRESIDED OVER THE\nPREMIER WEBSITE OF THE ALT-RIGHT, A LOOSE-KNIT GROUP OF\nWHITE NATIONALISTS AND UNABASHED ANTISEMITES AND RACISTS IS\nSLATED TO BE A SENIOR STAFF MEMBER IN THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE,\nWHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT? >> I SAY JUDGE AT THE END OF\nTHIS TERM TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT AMERICA IS BETTER, WHETHER YOUR\nISSUES ARE BETTER, WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE HAVE JOBS, WHETHER OR\nNOT PEOPLE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES, WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE CAN NOW\nACHIEVE THEIR DREAMS RATHER THAN DEPENDING ON A GOVERNMENT\nPAYCHECK. AT THE END OF THIS FOUR YEARS,\nYOU CAN THEN JUDGE STEVE BANNON. YOU CAN JUDGE REINCE PRIEBUS.\nMOST OF ALL YOU CAN JUDGE DONALD TRUMP.\nUNTIL THEN, I URGE EVERYBODY TO TAKE THE WISDOM OF PRESIDENT\nOBAMA WHICH IS TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE.\nDON'T CONDEMN HIM BEFORE THEY HAVE EVER EVEN TAKEN OFFICE\nWHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THIS HOUR SO FAR, WHICH IS TO\nLITERALLY START BEFORE THEY HAVE EVEN TAKEN OFFICE TO SAY\nBASICALLY WE ARE GOING TO HOLD EVERYTHING IN THE PAST AGAINST\nYOU SO THAT WE IMPEDE ANY ABILITY TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT\nIN THE FUTURE. YOU JUST CAN'T DO THAT.\n>> THAT IS IN NO WAY WHAT WE ARE DOING.\nIT IS COMPLETELY FAIR TO ASK ANY PRESIDENT-ELECT, ASK OF ANY\nPRESIDENT-ELECT WHY THEY ARE SOFTENING OR BACKING AWAY OR\nSEEMING NEGOTIABLE ON CAMPAIGN PROMISES THEY WERE SO FIRM ON\nDURING THE ELECTION. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH\nTHAT. THAT'S COMPLETELY FAIR.\nTHAT'S NOT BIASED. THAT'S NOT BEING CRITICAL.\nTHAT'S JUST ASKING QUESTIONS THAT WE SHOULD ASK OF WHO IS\nGOING TO LEAD THIS COUNTRY. >> LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.\nYOU YOURSELF HAVE SAID HE'S GOT TO ACT MORE PRESIDENTIAL, HE'S\nGOT TO BE MORE REASONABLE, HE'S GOT TO BE MORE OPEN.\nHE DOES THOSE THREE THINGS AND WHAT DO YOU DO?\nDID YOU COMPLIMENT HIM? DID YOU SAY THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT\nI ASKED HIM TO DO? DID YOU SAY THIS IS WHAT I HAVE\nSAID HE SHOULD DO? DID YOU DO ANY OF THOSE THINGS?\nNO. WHAT DID YOU DO AND SAY?\n>> RANDY, I AM NOT IN THE BUSINESS -- I DON'T THINK NUMBER\nONE, I DON'T THINK ENOUGH OF MYSELF TO THINK THAT DONALD\nTRUMP IS TAKING CAMPAIGN ADVICE FROM ME, THEN, OR TAKING ADVICE\nFROM ME NOW. I THINK IT'S OKAY TO ASK\nQUESTIONS OF A PRESIDENT-ELECT AND HOW THEY HAVE CHANGED ON\nISSUES FROM CAMPAIGN TO ONCE THEY HAVE WON.\nSAME THING WITH BARACK OBAMA. WE WILL LEAVE IT HERE.\nTHANK YOU. >> WHY DID YOU HAVE ONE GUEST\nSAY THAT? >> THE GREAT THING IS, YOU CAME\nON AND YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SAY A WHOLE BUNCH.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH. NOT MY JOB TO BE HEAPING PRAISE\nON POLITICIANS. AT ANY END OF THE SPECTRUM.\n>> IT IS YOUR JOB TO PICK PEOPLE WHO COME ON.\nWHEN HE DOES THAT WHICH YOU ARE SUGGESTING YOU NEED TO HAVE\nPEOPLE TO COME ON TO SAY THAT'S WHAT HE SHOULD DO.\n>> THERE YOU GO.

THE RELEASE SAID THEY WILL WORK\nAS EQUAL PARTNERS WHICH I ASSUME MEANS THEY BOTH REPORT TO THE\nPRESIDENT AS OPPOSED TO STEVE BANNON AS A SENIOR COUNSELOR\nREPORTING TO THE WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF?\n>> LOTS OF PEOPLE REPORT TO THE PRESIDENT.\nSO THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.\nTHERE'S ALSO NOTHING WRONG WITH HAVING DISPARATE VOICES WITHIN\nTHE WHITE HOUSE. STEVE BANNON, IT'S GREAT.\nHE COULD BE A COEQUAL, EVEN LOUDER VOICE IN ADVISING THE\nPRESIDENT. IN THE WHITE HOUSE THAT I SERVED\nIN, KARL ROVE WAS A VERY MAJOR PRESENCE, BOTH BECAUSE OF HIS\nRELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRESIDENT, AND HIS ASTUTENESS AS A\nPOLITICAL AND POLICY STRATEGIST. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH\nHAVING DISPARATE VOICES. THE PROBLEM ARISES WHEN THERE\nISN'T ONE PERSON CLEARLY IN CHARGE OF THE PRESIDENT'S\nCALENDAR AND RUNNING THE STAFF, AND THAT PERSON --\n>> ASSUMING REINCE PRIEBUS IS THAT PERSON?\n>> SHOULD BE THAT PERSON AND THE PRESIDENT, MY ADVICE TO\nPRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP, AND ANY PRESIDENT, WOULD BE, MAKE SURE\nYOU'VE EMPOWERED THAT PERSON TO DO THEIR JOB.\nTHEY DON'T HAVE TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT VOICE AMONG YOUR\nADVISERS. THEY DO HAVE TO HAVE THE\nAUTHORITY TO RUN THE STAFF, SET THE STRATEGIC PRIORITIES ON THE\nDIRECTION OF THE PRESIDENT. >> AND SO YOU DID ALL THAT WHEN\nYOU WERE PRESIDENT BUSH'S CHIEF OF STAFF BUT YOU MENTIONED KARL\nROVE, SENIOR ADVISER. HE WOULD BE ABLE TO GO AHEAD\nIMMEDIATE AND TALK TO THE PRESIDENT.\nYOU MIGHT NOTE EVEN KNOW ABOUT THAT?\n>> I WOULD KNOW ABOUT IT, BUT ABSOLUTELY.\nHE HAD FULL ACCESS, AND I DARE SAY KARL ROVE'S ADVICE TO THE\nPRESIDENT ON MANY ISSUES WAS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN MY\nADVICE. >> WHAT CONCERNS BE ABOUT THIS\nSTRUCTURE THAT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED RIGHT NOW FOR THIS\nNEW WHITE HOUSE? >> THE REST OF THE GOVERNMENT\nNEEDS TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE PRESIDENT'S DIRECTIONS ARE\nCOMING THROUGH ONLY ONE PERSON. AND ONE PERSON WHO SETS THE\nCALENDAR OF THE PRESIDENT, ONE PERSON WHO DIRECTS THE STAFF,\nHIRES AND FIRES THE STAFF. AND ONE PERSON WHO KEEPS THE\nGOVERNMENT ON THE STRATEGIC PRIORITIES OF THE PRESIDENT.\nNOW, IF THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T LIKE WHAT THE CHIEF OF STAFF IS\nDOING, HE NEEDS A NEW CHIEF OF STAFF.\nBUT MY STRONG ADVICE WOULD BE, HOWEVER YOU, HOWEVER YOU GUSSY\nUP THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, MAKE SURE THAT REINCE PRIEBUS IS PROPERLY\nEMPOWERED TO DO THE JOB THAT I BELIEVE HE'S CAPABLE OF DOING.\n>> IF THE PRESIDENT-ELECT WERE TO SAY, JOSH, WHAT'S THE SINGLE\nMOST IMPORTANT THING YOU THINK I NEED TO DO RIGHT NOW AT THIS\nEARLY STAGE IN THE TRANSITION? WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU HAVE FOR\nHIM? >> PERSONNEL IS THE MOST\nIMPORTANT THING RIGHT NOW AND THAT'S I'M SURE WHAT THEY'RE\nSPENDING THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF TIME ON.\nBUT THEN ALSO, SET THE AGENDA FOR THE NEXT, FOR THE NEXT EIGHT\nOR TEN MONTHS. THE PRESIDENCY IS, I THINK, THEY\nWILL DISCOVER, JUST AN EXTRAORDINARILY COMPLEXY HA TO E\nAND RUN. AND THE INBOX FILLS UP WITH\nURGENT CRISES IMMEDIATELY. THE DAY YOU STEP IN THE DOOR.\nAND WHAT THE PRESIDENT AND HIS TEAM NEED TO BE SURE THEY DO IS\nTO LEAVE TIME FOR THE STUFF THAT'S IMPORTANT AMONG THEIR\nAGENDA. DON'T LET THE URGENT DRIVE OUT\nTHE IMPORTANT. >> ONE FINAL QUESTION.\nYOU LIKE REINCE PRIEBUS AS WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF, HIGHLY\nQUALIFIED, TTEMPERAMENTALLY FIT FOR THE JOB.\nSTEVE BANNON YOU DON'T KNOW HIM, BUT HEARD A LOT ABOUT HIM.\nDOES THAT GIVE YOU ANY CONCERN? >> WELL, YOU KNOW, DISPARATE\nVOICES, GREAT. AND I WOULD SAY TO, TO ALL OF,\nYOU KNOW, THE PEOPLE THAT I SERVED WITH IN GOVERNMENT, I\nSAY, GIVE THEM A CHANCE. 'S\nTHE SAME CHANCE THE WHOLE COUNTRY NEEDS TO GIVE THE\nPRESIDENT. LOTS OF PEOPLE AMONG\nESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS LIKE MYSELF DID NOT SUPPORT TRUMP AS\nTHE CANDIDATE. PLENTY OF PEOPLE VOTED AGAINST\nTRUMP, BUT WE ALL NEED TO GIVE HIM AND HIS TEAM, THEY'VE EARNED\nIT, BY WINNING THIS ELECTION. WE NEED THEM TO GIVE THEM A\nCHANCE TO PROVE IN LEADERSHIP WHAT THEY CAN DO FOR THE\nCOUNTRY.

AND I THINK THAT WHEN HE'S\nTHROUGH PICKING HIS CABINET AND ALL HIS AAPPOINTEES, AND IT'S\nVERY INCLUSIVE, I THINK PEOPLE WILL BREATHE A SIGH OF RELIEF\nAND EVENTUALLY GET BEHIND HIM. >> WHAT DO YOU THINK?\n>> IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHEN STEVE BANNON CAME INTO THE\nCAMPAIGN. ANYONE WHO HAS READ BREITBART\nCONTENT HAS TO LEAVE WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT IT IS A SAFE\nPLACE FOR BIGOTS AND ANTI-SEMITE AND XENOPHOBES.\nAND STEVE BANNON BRINGS THAT TO THE WHITE HOUSE.\nTHAT IS DEEPLY DISCONCERTING. I THINK WHAT DONALD TRUMP DID\nWITH THIS VERY FIRST IMPORTANT DECISION IS HE SPLIT THE BABY.\nHE TRIED TO PLEASE ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS AND THE ALT-RIGHT.\nWHEN YOU TRY TO PLEASE EVERYONE, YOU END UP PLEASING NO ONE.\nI ALSO THINK IT'S A REALLY UNFORTUNATE MISSED OPPORTUNITY.\nYOU HAVE THREE WHITE GUYS IN CHARGE OF THE COUNTRY, FOUR IF\nYOU INCLUDE MIKE PENCE. WHEN YOU ADD SOMETHING CAPABLE\nLIKE KELLYANNE CONWAY, WHO HAS TIRELESSLY STEERED DONALD TRUMP\nIN THE RIGHT DIRECTIONS, AND WOULD HAVE MADE A GREAT CHIEF OF\nSTAFF. SO, I JUST THINK ALL AROUND\nMISSED OPPORTUNITY. >> I THINK WE HAVE TO SEE ALSO\nWHO GETS DIRECT ACCESS TO DONALD TRUMP.\nTHIS WHITE HOUSE IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER WHITE\nHOUSE WE'VE EVER COVERED. AND MY GUESS IS EVERYBODY'S\nGOING TO HAVE DIRECT ACCESS TO THIS PRESIDENT.\nTHE CHIEF OF STAFF IS FIRST IN LINE.\nHE'S THE GATEKEEPER. HE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT STAFFER\nIN THE WHITE HOUSE. BUT A SENIOR COUNSELOR, AS DAVID\nAXELROD WAS, AS KARL ROVE WAS, IS THE PRESIDENT'S WHISPERER.\nTHAT'S WHAT GIVES PEOPLE CONCERN.\nI WAS TOLD BY A SOURCE WHO WORKED IN THE CAMPAIGN, WHO\nWORKED ALONGSIDE STEVE BANNON. I WAS TOLD, LOOK, HE IS SOMEBODY\nWHO CARES ABOUT WINNING ABOVE ALL ELSE.\nAND HE DID IT DURING THIS CAMPAIGN, EVEN TO THE POINT\nWHERE HE SAID TO DONALD TRUMP, DON'T GO TO WISCONSIN WITHOUT\nPAUL RYAN. YOU DON'T TO WANT START A FIGHT\nWITH PAUL RYAN RIGHT NOW. THAT COMING FROM BAN BAN WAS\nSOMETHING TO BEHOLD BECAUSE HE DOESN'T LIKE RYAN, BUT THEY WON.\nSO, THE QUESTION IS, DOES THE FIGHT CONTINUE AND DOES HE WORK\nWITH CONGRESS OR DOES HE JUST, YOU KNOW, USE THIS AS A PLATFORM\nTHROUGH CHANNELLING THROUGH DONALD TRUMP?\nWE DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT.\n>> YOU KNOW, ONE THING THAT I WANTED TO POINT OUT -- SO MUCH\nOF THE CRITICISM NOW REALLY COMES FROM THOSE WHO DON'T LIKE\nDONALD TRUMP AND THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO JUMP ON FAR\nMORE THAN SUBSTANCE. WHEN YOU HEAR A GUY IS A WHITE\nSUPREMACIST, TO ME THAT INVOKES KLAN, SHORT OF LYNCHING, IT'S\nDESTRUCTIONS OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN PROPERTY.\nSTEVE BANNON IS GUILTY OF NONE OF THAT.\nI WOULD RECOMMEND AN ARTICLE WRITTEN BY KENT STERNEN, \"VANITY\nFAIR\" JUST IN AUGUST WHERE HE SAID ON HIS RADIO SHOW, BANNON\nCONSISTENTLY PUSHED BACK AGAINST ANY SUGGESTION OF RACISM.\nAND ALWAYS WAS TRYING TO KEEP THE FORUM LEVEL AND BALANCED.\nBUT I DO AGREE WITH YOU, GLORIA. I MEAN, PART OF WHAT SOMEBODY\nLIKE THAT DOES, HE'S A JAMES CARVELL, A PAUL BEGALA, A DAVID\nAXELROD WHO SEES THINGS STRATEGICALLY.\nAS A HOUSE MEMBER, KARL ROVE WOULD SAY TO US, YOU HAVE TO DO\nMEDICARE PART \"D\" IN THIS FORM BECAUSE ONCE IT GETS OUT OF\nCONTROL IT'S GOING TO COST MORE MONEY.\nA PRACTICAL BLEND OF POLITICS. >> WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, THE\nCONSERVATIVES WHO HAVE LEFT BREITBART AFTER STEVE BANNON\nTOOK OVER TALK ABOUT HOW HE MADE BUSINESS DECISIONS TO MAKE\nBREITBART A SITE THAT WAS HOSPITABLE TO THAT KIND OF\nWARPED THINKING. WHETHER IT WAS A BUSINESS\nDECISION OR WHETHER IT ACTUALLY REFLECTS HIS IDEOLOGY, THIS IS A\nREAL CONCERN. IT'S NOT JUST PUT FORWARD BY\nLIBERALS. IT IS CONSERVATIVES OUT THERE\nWHO HAVE WORKED WITH HIM AND WHO LEFT BREITBART.\nI WANT TO BRING IN CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST DAVID GERGEN.\nDAVID, WE SAW TWO SEPARATE REALITIES EMERGE ON TWITTER LAST\nNIGHT AFTER THE ANNOUNCEMENTS OF CHIEF OF STAFF AND SENIOR\nCOUNSELOR. THOSE REPUBLICANS WHO PRAISE\nREINCE PRIEBUS WHILE ALSO IGNORING STEVE BANNON'S\nPROXIMITY TO THE OVAL OFFICE. SPEAKER RYAN, WISCONSIN GOVERNOR\nSCOTT WALKER, SENATOR BOB CORKER OF TENNESSEE, SENATOR LINDSEY\nGRAHAM ALL PRAISING THE PRIEBUS PICK.\nTHEN REPUBLICANS WHO WENT AFTER BANNON, SUCH AS CHIEF STRATEGIST\nTO REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH, JOHN WEAVER WHO WROTE,\nQUOTE, JUST TO BE CLEAR, NEWS MEDIA, THE NEXT PRESIDENT NAMED\nA RACIST, ANTI-SEMITE AS THE CO-EQUAL OF THE CHIEF OF STAFF.\nNOT NORMAL. IT'S NOT JUST THE LIBERALS WHO\nARE ATTACKING THIS PICK, DAVID. >> ABSOLUTELY.\nIT'S BEEN WELL UNDERSTOOD FOR A LONG TIME THAT STEVE BANNON IS A\nSCORCH THE EARTH KIND OF GUY, SORT OF BURN THE HOUSE DOWN.\nSOME WOULD THINK NOW WE HAVE BANNON PLUS PRIEBUS, MAYBE ONLY\nWE'LL BURN HALF OF THE HOUSE DOWN.\nWE'LL HAVE TO SEE. I THINK DONALD TRUMP HAS A\nHISTORY OF CREATING RIVALRIES IN HIS OWN ORGANIZATION.\nDID THAT AT THE CASINOS, FOR EXAMPLE.\nAND HE SEEMS TO ENJOY THAT. SEEMS TO THINK HE GETS GOOD\nRESULTS OUT OF THAT. THAT'S THE WAY \"THE APPRENTICE,\"\nINTENTIONAL STIRRING UP CONFLICT.\nHE SEEMS TO BE DRAWN TO THAT. THE ISSUE ULTIMATELY BECOMES,\nTWO-HEADED LEADERSHIP SYSTEM WE KNOW NEVER SURVIVES.\nTHE QUESTION IS, WHICH ONE OF THE TWO IS GOING TO EMERGE?\nIT WOULD APPEAR THAT PRIEBUS HAS THE INSIDE TRACK TO BEING NUMBER\nONE, BECOMING THE CENTRAL POWER PLAYER THAT PAST CHIEFS OF STAFF\nHAVE BEEN. BUT YOU CAN'T COUNT ON ANYTHING\nIN THIS ENVIRONMENT. I WILL TELL YOU THIS, IF I MAY\nADD THIS, JAKE, ONE TIME I'VE SEEN MORE THAN ONE PERSON TRY TO\nRUN A WHITE HOUSE, WHICH IT WORKED, WAS THE -- WAS THE --\nWAS THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION. AS YOU'LL FAMOUSLY RECALL, THERE\nWAS A TRIUMBRERT WHO WERE RUNNING THE PLACE IN THE\nBEGINNING. THAT EVENTUALLY WORKED FOR TWO\nREASONS. ONE WAS ALL THREE KNEW THEY WERE\nWORKING WITH A MAN WHO HAD FIXED BELIEFS, WHO HAD FIXED\nPRINCIPLES, NEW HOW HE THOUGHT THE WORLD WORKED.\nAND, THEREFORE, THEY COULDN'T INFLUENCE HIM.\nTHEY COULDN'T GET INTO FIGHTS ABOUT THAT.\nAND IN THIS CASE WITH TRUMP, YOU'VE GOT A GUY -- THERE'S\nGOING TO BE A FIGHT EVERY DAY ABOUT WHAT TO DO BETWEEN THE\nBANNON FORCES AND PRIEBUS FORCES ABOUT WHERE TO GO, WHAT THE\nSTRATEGY OUGHT TO BE. IT'S GOING TO BE MORE DIFFICULT.\nBAKER EVENTUALLY EMERGED AS THE NUMBER ONE IN THE REAGAN\nOPERATION. >> IF YOU WERE SURER ABOUT WHERE\nDONALD TRUMP WAS GOING TO WIND UP ON POLICY, MAYBE THIS WOULD\nBE LESS OF AN ISSUE. BUT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE FIRST\nFEW DAYS OF PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP SOFTENING POSITIONS, IF\nYOU WILL, YOU KNOW, SHADING POSITION ON OBAMACARE, ON THE\nWALL, AND SO WE'RE NOT SURE WHERE DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO\nWIND UP. AND IN TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO\nHAVE BEEN WITH DONALD TRUMP, IT'S VERY ARE OFTEN THE LAST\nPERSON TO TALK TO HIM IS THE PERSON THAT HE ENDS UP AGREEING\nWITH. AND SO THERE IS A FEAR THAT,\nOKAY, WHAT IF IT'S BANNON, IF THAT'S THE LAST PERSON?\nTHAT'S WHERE THE FEARS ARE COMING FROM.\nBECAUSE -- BECAUSE BANNON HAS A RECORD HERE.\n>> PREEXISTING CONDITION. >> A PREEXISTING CONDITION, I\nWAS GOING TO SAY, RIGHT. AND SO THAT'S -- YOU KNOW,\nTHAT'S THE FEAR. WHO'S GOING TO BE THE LAST\nPERSON? >> WELL, LET ME SAY THIS.\nI SAW THE INTERACTION OF DAVE BOSSIE, KELLYANNE CONWAY AND\nSTEVE BANNON. I DID NOT SEE ANY ONE UPSMANSHIP\nAND THEY COMPLEMENTED EACH OTHER.\nTHEN YOU HAD REASONS PRIEBUS AND SEAN SPICER RUNNING THE RNC.\nIT WAS A PARALLEL ORGANIZATION. THEY ALSO WORKED TOGETHER.\nI MEAN, AS WE CAN SEE, IT WAS A WINNING COMBINATION.\nI TRULY DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE FEARS THAT WE'RE HEARING ABOUT\nARE FOUNDED. I UNDERSTAND WHY THEY'RE OUT\nTHERE, BUT I THINK THE PUSHBACK OF IT DOESN'T -- THE SUBSTANCE\nDOESN'T MERIT IT. >> JUST A FACTUAL MATTER.\nTHERE'S A LOT OF GOOD JOURNALISM THROUGHOUT THE INTERNET.\nCERTAINLY SOLID JOURNALISM I'VE READ IN BREITBART.\nHERE'S AN EXAMPLE. THERE'S A THING CALLED A TAG.\nWHEN YOU WRITE A STORY IT GETS TAGGED.\nLET'S SAY I WRITE A STORY ABOUT LIBYA, BENGHAZI, TAG BENGHAZI,\nTAG LIBYA, TAG HILLARY CLINTON, WHATEVER.\nYOU GO TO THE CNN.COM SITE AND SEARCH AND ALL THESE STORIES\nWILL COME UP. BREITBART HAS A TAG, BLACK\nCRIME. THAT'S NOT A TAG YOU'LL FIND IN\nTHE \"NEW YORK TIMES\" OR WASHINGTON POST OR CNN OR FOX\nNEWS. THAT IS A TAG THAT IS APPEALING\nTO A SPECIFIC GROUP. >> THERE IS NO DENYING IT.\nYOU CANNOT RESHAPE OR REPACKAGE WHAT BREITBART IS.\nLET ME SPEAK ON BEHALF OF MY LATE FRIEND, ANDREW BITEREITBAR\nNOT WHAT IT STARTED OUT AS. AND MARKETED TO THIS GROUP OF\nPEOPLE. I'LL AGREE, THERE IS SOME GOOD\nJOURNALISM, AT LEAST SOME GOOD JOURNALISTS AT BREITBART.COM.\nBUT IT IS INARGUABLE. THE IDEA THAT THAT HAS COME OVER\nTO THE WHITE HOUSE IN SUCH AN INFLUENTIAL POSITION IS VERY\nALARMING. I HAVE TO -- I HAVE TO DISAGREE\nWITH MY FRIEND, DAVID GERGEN. I'M NOT SO SURE THAT REINCE HAS\nTHE INSIDE TRACK TO THE TOP JOB. I AM WORRIED THAT REINCE WAS A\nTOKEN TO CALM THE ESTABLISHMENT AND THAT BANNON IS ACTUALLY\nGOING TO BE DOING MORE OF THE STRATEGIZING AND MORE OF THE\nDIRTY WORK. DONALD TRUMP OVER THE COURSE OF\nTHE CAMPAIGN WAS NOT ALWAYS NICE TO REINCE PRIEBUS.\nHE SAID AT ONE POINT HE SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF HIMSELF.\nSO, I THINK ACTUALLY TRUMP AND BANNON ARE FAR MORE ALIGNED AND\nHE TRUSTS HIM MORE THAN HE TRUSTS REINCE AND REINCE WAS PUT\nIN THERE TO PLEASE PEOPLE LIKE PAUL RYAN.\n>> THERE'S A LOT OF FEARS OUT THERE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT,\nMANY OF THEM THEORETICAL. IN SANCTUARY CITIES, CITIES\nTHROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY THAT HAVE DECLARED THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING\nTO ENFORCE FEDERAL IMMIGRATION LAWS, SANCTUARY CITIES THOSE ARE\nLET THEORETICAL. NOW DONALD TRUMP HAS PLEDGED TO\nDEPORT UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS IN THIS COUNTRY, MAY MATTER MOST\nIN SANCTUARY CITIES, WHERE OFFICIALS SAY THEY WON'T ENFORCE\nIMMIGRATION LAWS. LIKE THE WINDY CITY, WHERE ROSA\nFLORES JOINS ME. OFFICIALS SAY THEY'RE WORRIED\nABOUT A HEALTH CRISIS. ROSA, EXPLAIN WHAT'S GOING ON IN\nCHICAGO. >> Reporter: YOU KNOW, YOU'RE\nABSOLUTELY RIGHT, JAKE. LEADERS ARE CALLING THE\nSITUATION AFTER THE ELECTION A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS BECAUSE OF\nTHE NUMBER OF CALLS INTO CRISIS HOT LINES AND SUICIDE HOT LINES.\nTHEY SAY THEY HAVE INCREASED BY 200% SINCE THE ELECTION.\nSO, THEY ARE VERY, VERY WORRIED. SO, THEY BREAK IT DOWN LIKE\nTHIS. THEY SAY THAT THEY HAVE FOUND\nEVIDENCE THAT CHILDREN HAVE TAKEN THE RHETORIC FROM THE\nELECTION AS PERMISSION TO BULLY IMMIGRANTS, MUSLIMS, THE LBGTQ\nAND OTHER VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES.\nTHAT'S WHAT MEDICAL EXPERTS HERE IN CHICAGO ARE VERY WORRIED\nABOUT BECAUSE THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH EFFECTS\nOF THOSE COMMUNITIES. NOW, I SHOULD SAY THAT MAYOR\nRAHM EMANUEL HAS COME OUT AND SAID CHICAGO IS A SANCTUARY\nCITY, IT WILL REMAIN A SANCTUARY CITY AND A SAFE AND SECURE\nPLACE. >> MAYORS OF OTHER SANCTUARY\nCITIES COMING OUT AND DECLARING THEIR STATUS ON THESE\nUNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS IN THEIR >> Reporter: YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY\nRIGHT. THE CONCERN IS WIDESPREAD.\nTHE MAYOR OF MINNEAPOLIS HAS ALSO COME OUT AND SAID SOMETHING\nSIMILAR, ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT MAYOR RAHM EMANUEL HAS SAID.\nIN MINNEAPOLIS, SHE SAID, LOOK, MY POLICE OFFICERS ARE NOT GOING\nTO BE IMMIGRATION AGENTS. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE\nEXERCISING FEDERAL LAW, AGAIN, BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY CONCERNED,\nJAKE, ABOUT THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF CERTAIN COMMUNITIES\nWITHIN THAT CITY. >> ROSA FLORES IN CHICAGO.\nWE SHOULD NOTE, I MEAN, THE HOSTILITY IS NOT ONLY ONE WAY.\nCERTAINLY IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THE BULK OF THESE INCIDENTS SEEM TO\nBE AIMED AT MINORITIES. WE'VE SEEN TWO MEN ARRESTED IN\nCONNECTICUT FOR BEATING UP SOMEONE THAT WAS HOLDING A TRUMP\nSIGN. THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER INCIDENTS\nLIKE THAT. IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY\nPEOPLE HAVE BEEN CALLING FOR NOT JUST PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP BUT\nMAYBE PRESIDENT OBAMA AND MAYBE WE'LL HEAR HIM SAY THAT, BUT\nALSO POSSIBLY HILLARY CLINTON TO COME OUT AND TELL PEOPLE TO COOL\nIT, TO COOL DOWN. >> YEAH.\nI WATCHED THE \"60 MINUTES\" INTERVIEW WITH DONALD TRUMP LAST\nNIGHT AND HE SAID, I'M GOING TO LOOK STRAIGHT TO THE CAMERA AND\nSAY, STOP IT, TO HIS SUPPORTERS WHO WERE ENGAGING IN THIS KIND\nOF STUFF. YOU HAVE TO WONDER WHY HE DIDN'T\nLOOK AT THE CAMERA THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN AND SPEAK THAT\nSTRONGLY AS HE DID. UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S TOO LITTLE\nTOO LATE RIGHT NOW, AND I THINK WHAT HE'S GOING TO NEED TO DO IS\nDELIVER A VERY SERIOUS SPEECH IN WHICH HE LOOKS TO THE CAMERA AND\nHE SAYS, LEGAL IMMIGRATION IS A GOOD THING.\nDIVERSITY IS A GOOD THING. LIVING NEXT DOOR TO PEOPLE WHO\nDON'T LOOK LIKE YOU IS WHAT MAKES AMERICA GREAT.\nSHORT OF THAT, THE SORT OF, YOU KNOW, QUICK NOD, STOP IT, I\nDON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO STAUNCH THE REAL ANXIETY THAT'S\nOUT THERE AROUND THE WORLD, IN LOTS OF DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES\nOVER THE THINGS HE HAS SAID AND THE THINGS HE'S PROMISED TO DO.\n>> WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION.\nDAVID, I'LL COME BACK TO YOU. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A VERY QUICK\nBREAK. WE'RE GOING TO SQUEEZE IN A\nCOMMERCIAL AND THEN KEEP TALKING ABOUT THE SUBJECT.\nAGAIN, WE'RE WAITING FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA TO COME OUT FOR\nTHIS NEWS CONFERENCE.

MATT McCLARDY SERVED AS CHIEF OF\nSTAFF TO PRESIDENT CLINTON. >> DELIGHTED TO BE WITH YOU\nTODAY. >> IT'S NOT EASY COMING FROM THE\nOUTSIDE. YOU CAME FROM ARKANSAS.\nEVEN THOUGH BILL CLINTON WAS A LONG-TERM GOVERNOR AND HEAD OF\nTHE DLC, HE WAS AN OUTSIDER. >> HE WAS.\nJUST LIKE REAGAN WAS. >> EXACTLY.\n>> THEY HAD GOVERNMENT EXPERIENCE.\nSTILL, HOW HAR WAS IT FOR YOU GUYS WHEN YOU CAME IN?\n>> NO QUESTION. IT'S A CHALLENGE.\nYOU'VE GOT HIGH EXPECTATIONS, ANDREA.\nSO MANY STAKEHOLDERS IN OUR CASE, THE REPUBLICANS THAT HELD\nTHE WHITE HOUSE FOR 12 YEARS. YOU HAD AN UNEXPECTED ELECTION\nTHERE WITH GOVERNOR BILL CLINTON PULLING OFF THE UPSET.\nI WOULD ALSO SAY THAT AFTER 9/11, I THINK TRANSITIONS\nCHANGED. IT'S NOW OKAY TO START THE\nTRANSITION EARLY. IT IS EXPECTED.\nIN FACT, THERE IS FEDERAL FUNDING FOR IT.\nTHAT'S A POSITIVE HERE. >> THERE WAS A LOT OF\nSUPERSTITION ON THE PART OF BOTH CANDIDATES, FRANKLY, DIDN'T WANT\nTO TALK ABOUT IT. >> MEASURING THE DRAPES.\nTHE PRESS COULD BE CRITICAL OF THAT AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\nMIGHT TAKE EXCEPTION. >> DONALD TRUMP -- NOW I HAVE\nBEEN TOLD THAT THEY HAVE NOT YET HAD HIS PRESIDENTIAL DAILY\nBRIEFING. UNLESS SOMETHING HAPPENED IN THE\nPAST COUPLE OF HOURS. HE HAS NOT HAD THE SPECIAL ALL\nINCLUSIVE NATIONAL SECURITY BRIEFING HE'S ENTITLED TO.\nTHERE IS NO CONTACT FROM TRUMP TRANSITION TO THE NATIONAL\nSECURITY AGENCIES, TO THE CIA, DOD AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT.\nTHEY ARE TAKING THEIR TIME. THESE AGENCIES ARE READY AND\nWELCOMING TO TALK TO THEM. THEY HAVE REACHED OUT BUT\nHAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING BACK. >> A SEAMLESS TRANSITION IS\nESSENTIAL, PARTICULARLY NOW MORE THAN EVER WITH SECURITY ISSUES.\nECONOMIC ISSUES. I THINK THE TRANSITION FROM THE\nBUSH 43 ADMINISTRATION TO THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WITH THE\n2008 ECONOMIC DOWNTURN WAS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL IN ACHIEVING\nA MUCH BETTER OUTCOME THAN OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE\nCASE. IT IS IMPORTANT FROM AN ECONOMIC\nSTANDPOINT BUT MORE FROM A SECURITY STANDPOINT.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA HAS SAID HE'S COMMITTED TO A SMOOTH\nTRANSITION. THE TRUMP TEAM NEEDS TO TAKE HIM\nUP ON THAT, IF THEY HAVEN'T. >> HOW HARD IS IT TO MAKE A\nTWO-HATTED WHITE HOUSE WORK? YOU HAVE TWO POWER CENTERS NOW,\nREINCE PRIEBUS AND STEVE BANNON. >> TWO FORMAL POWER CENTERS.\nTO BE FAIR, EVERY WHITE HOUSE -- REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT -- HAS\nPOWER CENTERS. THAT'S PART OF POLITICS.\nIT'S SOMEWHAT OF A GAME OF THRONES HOPEFULLY KEPT UNDER\nCONTROL IN MODERATION. PRESIDENT REAGAN HAD A TROIKA\nWITH JIM BAKER AND MIKE DEEVER. THAT EVENTUALLY CHANGED.\nPRESIDENT CARTER HAD A TRIO COMING IN AND THAT CHANGED OVER\nTIME. A CHIEF OF STAFF NEEDS TO HAVE\nTHE AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY.\nTO BE FAIR, HOWEVER, REINCE PRIEBUS WHO WAS A SOLID CHOICE,\nHE AND STEEF BANNON WORKED TOGETHER APPARENTLY EFFECTIVELY\nON THE CAMPAIGN. BOTH ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS\nFOR DONALD TRUMP. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT PEOPLE YOU\nGREW UP WITH IN ARKANSAS. RURAL WHITE VOTERS.\nBILL CLINTON UNDER THAT IN 1992 AS DID YOU IN THAT CAMPAIGN.\nBILL CLINTON HAS REPORTEDLY BEEN -- WE HAVE CONFIRMED THIS\nWITH OTHER PEOPLE -- BEEN VERY CONCERNED THAT THERE WASN'T\nENOUGH OUTREACH, THAT LUZERNE COUNTY, FOR INSTANCE.\n40% OF THE MARGIN IN PENNSYLVANIA CAME FROM FORMER\nDEMOCRATS WHO VOTED FOR TRUMP IN THAT COUNTY ALONE.\nYOU'VE GOT MILWAUKEE. SHE LOST WISCONSIN BY 27,000\nVOTES. AND UNDERPERFORMED BARACK OBAMA\nIN MILWAUKEE BY 43,000 VOTES. THAT'S THE MARGIN THERE.\nSHE NEVER WENT TO WISCONSIN. DID THEY FAIL TO RECOGNIZE WHAT\nWAS HAPPENING IN RURAL AND WHITE WORKING CLASS AMERICA AND -- I\nMEAN SHE WENT TO GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN, ON THE LAST DAY OF THE\nCAMPAIGN BUT NOT BEFORE THAT. OUR ANALYSIS IS HE WENT TO 133\nSTOPS IN THOSE BIG BATTLEGROUND STATES FROM THE GENERAL ELECTION\nON. SHE WENT TO ONLY 88.\n>> WELL, THAT'S A STRONG POST-MORTEM.\nHINDSIGHT IS A GREAT SUBSTITUTE FOR WISDOM AT THE TIME.\nI THINK THERE WERE A LOT OF FACTORS IN THIS CAMPAIGN.\nYOU MENTIONED ONE SEGMENT OF VOTERS.\nIT'S A FAIR POINT TO MAKE FOR SURE.\nIT REDREW THE ELECTORAL MAP THAN THE ONE CHUCK TODD AND OTHERS\nDREW BEFORE THE ELECTION. BUT AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS, I\nTHINK AT THE HEART OF IT, IT WAS A CHANGE ELECTION.\nPEOPLE FINALLY DECIDED I WON'T CHANGE.\nI AM TIRED OF WASHINGTON NOT WORKING WELL.\nMY LIFE'S NOT GETTING BETTER. I WANT TO TRY SOMETHING\nDIFFERENT. DONALD TRUMP RECOGNIZED THAT.\nTO HIS CREDIT HE TAPPED IN TO IT AND WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT.\n>> SHE'S BLAMING JAMES COMEY. >> THE COMEY INTERVENTION WAS\nUNPRECEDENTED AND IS FRANKLY UNSETTLING WHEN THE FBI TAKES A\nROLE LIKE THAT. IT WAS UNPRECEDENTED.\nLOOKING BACK, IT CERTAINLY DID STOP OR SLOW HER MOMENTUM.\nI THINK SECRETARY CLINTON WAS ON THE WAY TO CLOSING THE DEAL.\nBUT, TO BE FAIR, THERE WERE A LOT OF FACTORS IN THIS CAMPAIGN\nINCLUDING TURNOUT.

HE MORE THAN DOUBLED HIS\nPOSITION ON THE MSCI. >> WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IN THE\nLAST SEVERAL WEEKS, AT LEAST A FEW WEEKS, IS THAT HE HAS GOTTEN\nOUT OF GOLD, HE SAID IT ON \"SQUAWK BOX\" SAID HE'S SHORT\nBUBBLES, SHORT THE TEN YEAR, BUNDS, GILTS, YOU NAME IT, AND\nHE'S SHORT IT. >> DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU CONSIDER\nA BUBBLE, BUT, YES. BASED ON WHAT HE SAID, WE CAN\nMAKE SOME DEDUCTIONS THERE. AND I'M CURIOUS WHAT ERIN WOULD\nTHINK. WOULD YOU EXPECT HE'S STILL IN\nTHE TECHNOLOGY NAMES? >> IT IS HARD.\nTHIS IS THIRD QUARTER, IT IS VERY, YOU KNOW, THERE IS A LONG\nLAG BETWEEN THE FILING AND NOW. I THINK HE'S PROBABLY GOTTEN OUT\nOF A LOT OF THE NAMES AND I THINK THAT IN GENERAL YOU HAVE\nSEEN HUGE ROTATIONS IN THE LAST THREE DAYS, POST THE ELECTION.\nSO I IMAGINE THAT HE OR SOMEONE LIKE HIM WOULD HAVE GOTTEN OUT\nOF PRETTY MUCH ALL OF THOSE EMERGING MARKET TRADES BY NOW.\n>> WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS OVER THE NEXT SIX WEEKS TO TWO\nOR THREE MONTHS IN EMERGING MARKETS?\nIS THERE A BOUNCE? >> THIS IS MY -- I'M VERY\nBEARISH IN EMERGING MARKETS NOW. I THINK THIS WAS A GAME CHANGER\nFOR EM AS RATES GO UP. THAT REALLY KILLS EMERGING\nMARKETS. AND I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S\nGOING TO STOP. I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, YOU SAW\nBRAZILIAN ODS AS AN EXAMPLE, 2019, BRAZILIAN BONDS.\nBUT THEY WERE TRADING AT YIELDS OF, YOU KNOW, 16% AT THE\nBEGINNING OF THIS YEAR, NOW AT 12%.\nWE STILL HAVE MORE ROOM TO RUN. SO, YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT WE'RE\nAT EARLY INNINGS OF THIS EMERGING MARKET TRADE AND A LOT\nOF MONEY THAT WENT INTO THEM, A LOT OF MONEY THAT NEEDS TO COME\nOUT. >> YOU AGREE WITH THAT?\n>> YEAH, I'VE NOT BEEN A FAN OF THE EMERGING MARKETS FOR A\nWHILE. I MISSED THE TRADE HIGHER.\nI DON'T THINK I'LL MISS THE TRADE LOWER.\nI THINK YOU CAN -- I THINK YOU CAN SHORT THEM.\nI SEE SO MANY HEDGE FUNDS NOW COMING THROUGH, YOU KNOW, TO\nLOOK AT -- TRYING TO RAISE MONEY, THAT'S USUALLY A SIGN TO\nME OF A TOP. SO I THINK YOU SHORT THEM.\n>> THESE ARE ALWAYS -- KATE, YOU KNOW, WE SAY IT EVERY TIME, TAKE\nIT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT KIND OF FILINGS, MAYBE MORE SO NOW,\nGIVEN THE SURPRISING TO MANY PEOPLE ELECTION RESULT AND THE\nWAY THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE NOW REPOSITIONING THEIR PORTFOLIOS.\n>> SO FAR QUICKLY, TWO TAKEAWAYS, WE HAVE SEEN PEOPLE\nGET INTO THE LARGER TECH NAMES. THIRD POINT DID THE SAME THING.\nGOT INTO, I BELIEVE, ALPHABET AND ALIBABA AS WELL.\nI REPORTED THAT THIS MORNING. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS A\nDEFENSIVE MOVE DURING THE THIRD QUARTER WHEN WE HAD SO MUCH\nUNCERTAINTY. THAT'S A POSSIBILITY.\nTHE OTHER THING I SAW WAS PEOPLE GOING LONG PHARMACEUTICAL NAMES\nWHICH COULD BE REGARDED AS A REALLY SAVVY ELECTION BET.\nTHAT WAS THE ONE AREA THAT PEOPLE THOUGHT WOULD BENEFIT\nFROM A TRUMP VICTORY. >> RIGHT.\n>> AND WHAT THOSE STOCKS HAVE DONE.\n>> FINANCIALS HAVE GOTTEN BEATEN UP A LOT GOING INTO THE ELECTION\nAND THEY WERE AT BOTTOM BARREL PRICES.\nSO RIGHT BEFORE THE ELECTION, A WEEK GOING INTO THE ELECTION,\nPEOPLE THOUGHT THAT IN EITHER CASE, WHETHER CLINTON OR TRUMP,\nTHE PHARMA BOUNCED. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH.\nKATE KELLY.

IT WAS A QUESTION OF HOW TO\nCREATE VALUE FOR SHAREHOLDERS. >> DO YOU THINK BILL ACKMAN CAN\nEVER MAKE HIS MONEY BACK? >> I DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS AVERAGE\nCOST IS, SO IT'S HARD TO SAY. >> OVER A HUNDRED DOLLARS A\nSHARE. >> IT'S GOING TO TAKE AWHILE.\nWE THINK VALEANT IS WORTH EASILY DOUBLE THE CURRENT PRICE.\nAND IF THINGS BREAK RIGHT OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, IT COULD BE\nTRIPLE. THAT GETS YOU INTO THE MID TO\nHIGH 50s. NOT A HUNDRED.\n>> WHAT IS TECH NOW? IS TECH SOCIAL MEDIA?\nIS IT SEMICONDUCTORS? IS IT TELECOM?\nWHAT IS IT? >> IT'S A BIG TENT.\n>> WHAT'S ATTRACTIVE, WHAT'S NOT ATTRACTIVE?\n>> WHAT'S INTERESTING IS WHAT'S HAPPENED SINCE TRUMP GOT\nELECTED. I THINK PEOPLE HAVE MAYBE\nMISINTERPRETED THAT TO BEING SOMETHING THAT SILICON VALLEY\nNOT BEING A SUPPORTER OF PETER THIEL AND PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP\nHAS HAD HARSH WORDS ABOUT JEFF BEZOS AND AMAZON IN PARTICULAR.\nI THINK THE SELLOFF IS DUE MUCH MORE TO THE FACT THAT GROWTH IS\nEXPECTED TO BE FASTER UNDER TRUMP.\nAND THEREFORE THE SCARCITY OF GROWTH WILL BE LESS.\nAND SO THE BIGGEST GROWTH COMPANIES OUT THERE LIKE AMAZON,\nFACEBOOK, GOOGLE, THERE'S MORE COMPETITION FOR THOSE DOLLARS.\nMONEY IS FLOWING OUT OF THAT. I THINK THE SELLOFF IN ALL THREE\nOF THOSE NAMES IS CREATING A GOOD BUYING OPPORTUNITY HERE.\n>> ASIDE FROM ROTATION, THOUGH, IS THERE A CONCERN THAT AMAZON\nIN PARTICULAR MIGHT HAVE A TARGET ON ITS BACK GIVEN THE\nCOMMENTS THAT MR. TRUMP HAS MADE ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL\nESSENTIALLY SAYING THERE ARE GOING TO BE HUGE ANTITRUST\nCONCERNS GIVEN THERE COULD BE TRADE WARS AND AMAZON HAS A\nTHIRD OF ITS PHYSICAL FOOTPRINT OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES NOT\nTHAT MUCH IN RETAIL SALES OVERSEAS?\nALL THESE THINGS ADD UP TO BE POSSIBLE CONCERNS ABOUT AMAZON\nON TOP OF THAT ROTATION THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.\n>> YEAH. I THINK THAT CERTAINLY PART OF\nWHY AMAZON CORRECTED 20% OR MORE AND THE OTHERS HAVE CORRECTED\nLESS. >> THAT IS THE QUESTION IN TERMS\nOF THE WAY YOU THINK DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO APPROACH SOME\nOF THESE BIG COMPANIES HE'S MADE COMMENTS ABOUT.\nINTERESTINGLY, YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT THE AT&T\nTRANSACTION WITH TIME WARNER WOULD BE IN JEOPARDY.\nPEOPLE AT AT&T THINK THAT THEY HAVE A BETTER SHOT OF GETTING IT\nTHROUGH PERHAPS THAN EVEN NECESSARILY IF HILLARY CLINTON\nHAD WON. >> YOU KNOW, I MEAN, IF YOU\nTAKE -- LET'S GO BACK. YOU TALKED ABOUT ANTITRUST.\nTHERE'S NO ISSUE WITH ANTITRUST FOR AMAZON AT ALL.\nBUT THEY'VE HAD THAT ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO ELECTRONIC BOOKS.\nAND AMAZON CONTROLLING 85% OF THAT MARKET, THE ISSUE ISN'T\nPART OF THE MARKET CONTROL. IT'S WHAT THE CONSUMER GETS OUT\nOF IT. AMAZON IS ALMOST ALWAYS THE LOW\nPRICE. THE SIZE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH\nTHAT. >> YOU'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE\nTARGET BECAUSE HE CAN'T REALLY GO AFTER AMAZON?\n>> WELL, HE CAN USE A LOT OF RHETORIC ON AMAZON, I THINK.\nBUT IT CREATES HEADLINE RISKS SO PEOPLE DON'T LIKE HEADLINE\nRISKS. >> WE'RE BACK TO THE CANDIDATE\nVERSUS PRESIDENT. THE THEME OF ALL COMPANIES IF\nTHEY GET TOO BIG, IT'S BAD. BUT IF YOU ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE\nAT&T/TIME WARNER IN TERMS OF VERTICAL INTEGRATION AND\nEVERYTHING ELSE AND IF HE TALKS TO THE REGULATORS DECIDING ON\nTHE DEAL AND THEY SAY IN THE END IT'S GOING TO BE BETTER FOR\nCONSUMERS, ADVANCE THE TECHNOLOGY.\nI GUARANTEE YOU A REPUBLICAN IS GOING TO BE MORE LIKELY TO LET\nIT GO THAN HILLARY. THAT'S WHY IT MAKES SENSE.\n>> THE DISTINCTION BEING HE CAME OUT PUBLICLY AND SAID THIS WAS\nTERRIBLE. WE HAVE TO BREAK UP --\n>> BUT THAT'S THE POPULOUS RHETORIC ABOUT BIG COMPANIES.\nI'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THIS WOULD -- I'VE NEVER BELIEVED\nTHAT THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING HE WOULD BUY.\nI ALWAYS THOUGHT AT&T/TIME WARNER WOULD WORK.\n>> YOU DIDN'T THINK HE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH WHEN HE SAID\nTHAT. >> NO.\n>> BACK TO THE -- >> I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE\nSUPPOSED TO MAKE OF IT. >> WELL, THE HUNDRED OTHER\nTHINGS WHERE YOU SAID YOU JUST LOOK AT IT AND SAY MY GOD.\nAND MORTIFIED. SO JUST THROW THAT IN WITH\nEVERYTHING ELSE. THE WALL AND MUSLIM.\n>> CAN I ASK ABOUT THE ROTATION MORE?\n>> COULD I STOP YOU? >> I DON'T KNOW.\nYOU KEEP TALKING. BACK TO ROTATION.\nYOU MAKE A GOOD TALK IN TERMS OF EVERYBODY WAS GOING TO\nTECHNOLOGY FOR GROWTH BECAUSE THAT WAS SEEN AS THE PLACE TO GO\nFOR GROWTH. AT THIS POINT WILL THOSE\nMANAGERS COME BACK? IS THIS A ROTATION THAT'S A SORT\nOF CHANGE IN THE MARKET AT THIS PLACE?\nIN YOUR VIEW? OR DOES IT COME BACK?\n>> WELL, IT'S GOING TO DEPEND ON THE INDIVIDUAL COMPANY\nFUNDAMENTALS AT THE END OF THE DAY.\nI THINK THAT THE GREATER ROTATION IS OUT OF UTILITIES,\nBOND PROXIES. I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE GREATER\nDANGER IS. ALPHABET IS 18 TIMES NEXT YEAR'S\nEARNINGS. THIS IS SORT OF DEMANDING IN\nTHIS KIND OF AN ENVIRONMENT. AND FACEBOOK DESPITE THE\nSLOWDOWN IN FACEBOOK, YOU'RE STILL COMING TO THE LOW 20s\nMULTIPLE. SO THE CONSUMER STAPLE HAS BEEN\nCARRYING THOSE MULTIPLES AND THEY GROW 3% TO 5%.\n>> SO WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE ROTATION AND WHETHER THE\nMONEY GOES BACK? >> I DON'T HAVE A STRONG VIEW ON\nTHAT. I THINK THERE'S STILL SOME\nINTERESTING NAMES IN TECHNOLOGY. WE STILL LIKE TWITTER A LOT.\nIT'S A DOMINANT FRANCHISE. IF YOU JUST LOOK AT ITS\nVALUATION RELATIVE TO ITS USERS. FACEBOOK HAS 35 TIMES --\nFACEBOOK IS ROUGHLY 35 TIMES THE VALUE, SIX TIMES THE USERS AS\nTWITTER. SO THERE'S A LOT OF SPACE FOR\nTWITTER TO MAKE MONEY ON USERS. THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID ON THE\nLAST CALL. THEY'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON\nPROFITABILITY AND RUN IT LIKE A BUSINESS.\nHOPEFULLY DOING ATE WAY WITH INCENTIVE OPTION PLANS THAT HAVE\nBEEN DESTRUCTIVE FOR SHAREHOLDERS VALUE.\nBUT WE'RE OPTIMISTIC ON TWITTER. >> AND JANA PARTNERS IS A NEW\nSHAREHOLDER THERE. THEY'RE AN ACTIVIST SO THAT WILL\nHELP. >> WHEN YOU TALK TECH, IT'S ALL\nTHIS SOCIAL MEDIA STUFF. DO YOU BUY CISCO NOW?\nIS THAT TECH? >> YEAH.\n>> IT IS? BUT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT\nANYMORE. WE TALK ABOUT THIS TWITTER WHICH\nI HAVE RIGHT HERE AND -- BUT SOCIAL MEDIA THAT'S TECH.\n>> YEAH. I --\n>> WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE THAT MAKE THE CONNECTERS AND ALL THE STUFF\nTHAT GOES INTO THE PHONES AND ALL THAT STUFF?\nANY OF THAT? YOU STILL OWN THAT STUFF OR NO?\nTHAT'S GOING TO BUILD OUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THIS GREAT\nFUTURE? INTERNET OF THINGS, ALL THESE\nTHINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING? >> QUITE A NICE RUN.\n>> QUALCOMM. IT'S TECH THAT'S NOT SOCIAL.\n>> HE LIKES TO BUY THINGS THAT WILL DOUBLE.\n>> HE WAS IN NXPA. >> NOW YOU CAN GET OUT OF THAT.\n>> QUALCOMM. >> ALL RIGHT.\nTHEN YOU'VE GOT TO BE REALLY SMART TO FIGURE OUT THE NEXT\nWAVE AFTER SOCIAL MEDIA OR WHAT PART OF SOCIAL MEDIA IS THE NEXT\nWAVE. I GUESS DO THE YOUNG PEOPLE\nUNDERSTAND THIS BETTER? MAYBE IV UNDERSTANDS SNAPCHAT.\nSNAPCHAT. RIGHT.\nBECAUSE IT DISAPPEARS.

YOU ARE SECURE IN CHICAGO.\nAND YOU ARE SUPPORTED IN CHICAGO.\n>> THE MAYOR DID NOT PROMISE TO PROTECT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WITH\nCRIMINAL RECORDS, WHICH FOR NOW IS EXACTLY WHO DONALD TRUMP IS\nTARGETING SO HE SAID LAST NIGHT ON \"60 MINUTES.\"\nTHE DEFINITION MEANS THAT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT DON'T COOPERATE\nWITH FEDERAL IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES.\nAND THOUSANDS OF CRIMINAL ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE RELEASED\nON U.S. STREETS EVERY YEAR. LIKE THE 2015 CASE OF FRANCISCO\nLOPEZ SANCHEZ WHO WAS CONVICTED OF SEVEN TIMES, DEPORTED FIVE\nTIMES, AND DESPITE FEDERAL AGENTS ASKING SAN FRANCISCO\nAUTHORITIES TO HOLD HIM, LOPEZ SANCHEZ WAS RELEASED GOT HOLD OF\nA GUN AND KILLED KATE STEINLY. PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP WILL\nBATTLE SANCTUARY CITIES BY CUTTING OFF FEDERAL FUNDS,\nCOSTING PLACES LIKE CHICAGO BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.\nIT REMAINS UNCLEAR IF BLOCKING FUNDS WOULD NEED CONGRESSIONAL\nAPPROVAL OR COULD BE DONE WITH EXECUTIVE ORDER.\nWHAT IS CLEAR IS THAT A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WITH NEW CHIEF\nSTRATEGIST STEVE BANNON AND REINCE PRIEBUS APPEAR LIKELY TO\nFAVOR A VERY TOUGH ANTI-IMMIGRATION STANCE.\nALONG WITH CHICAGO MAYOR MANUEL, BILL DE BLASIO AND LOS ANGELES\nMAYOR ERIC GAR SETTY ARE VOWING TO MAINTAIN THEIR SANCTUARY\nSTATUS, MEGYN. >> TRACE THANKS.\nJOINING ME NOW, ANDREW NAPOLITANO.\nGOOD TO SEE YOU, JUDGE. >> GOOD TO SEE YOU.\n>> CAN THEY DO THIS? CAN THE MAYOR SAY NO TO\nPRESIDENT TRUMP ONCE HE TAKES OFFICE.\n>> HERE'S WHAT THE MAYORS ARE NOT DOING.\nTHEY ARE NOT HIDING PEOPLE FROM THE FEDS.\nTHEY ARE REFUSING TO PROVIDE DATA AND INFORMATION TO THE\nFEDS. AND THE SUPREME COURT HAS RULED\nTHE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CANNOT COMMANDEER LOCAL POLICE AND MAKE\nTHEM WORK FOR THEM. SO EVEN THOUGH THIS WILL BE\nFRUSTRATING TO A PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HE PROBABLY WILL HAVE TO\nFIND SOME WAY TO SANCTION THEM FINANCIALLY --\n>> THAT'S WHAT HE'S SAYING, CANCEL ALL FEDERAL FUNDING TO\nTHEM. >> HE CAN'T DO THAT\nUNILATERALLY. I'M SURE HE COULD PUT INTO\nEXPENDITURE AND BLOCK GRANTS TO CITIES.\nDO THE FOLLOWING THINGS TO QUALIFY FOR THE BLOCK GRANTS.\nIT'S A BASIC PRINCIPLE OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW THAT THE\nFEDERAL GOVERNMENT CANNOT FORCE THE STATES OR THE TOWNS AND\nCITIES TO WORK FOR IT. SO MAYOR EMANUEL, MAYOR DE\nBLASIO ARE WITHIN THEIR LEGAL RIGHTS TO DO WHAT THEY'RE DOING.\n>> WHAT'S HAPPENS IS SANCTUARY CITIES GET CARRIED NOW THE A YOU\nREMEMBER INFORM DIFFERENT WAYS. IN CHICAGO, THEY ORIGINALLY JUST\nSTOPPED ALL AGENCIES FROM INQUIRING ABOUT IMMIGRATION\nSTATUS WHEN THEY PROVIDE SERVICES.\nIT'S LIKE DON'T ASK DON'T TELL, WE DON'T TO WANT KNOW.\nAND IN OTHER CITIES, THEY JUST REFUSE TO COOPERATE WITH I.C.E.\nISSUES OF DETAINER ON AN INDIVIDUAL.\nIT'S LIKE, DIDN'T HAPPEN, DIDN'T SEE IT.\n>> THAT STUFF CAN HAVE UNATTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT THE\nLOCALS ARE NOT GOING TO WANT. THE TYPE OF PEOPLE ARE NOT\nTALKING ABOUT AVERAGE MA AND PA. SOMEONE --\n>> LIKE FRANCISCO HERNANDEZ. >> CONVICTED OF A CRIME,\nGETTINGS OUT OF JAIL AND IS NOW FREE, BUT ILLEGALLY PRESENT.\n>> UH-HUH. >> ALLOWING THAT PERSON TO STAY\nIN CHICAGO IS GOING TO HARM THE CITIZENS OF CHICAGO.\n>> SO WHAT ARE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RIGHTS?\nI MEAN IF DONALD TRUMP TRIES TO TAKE AWAY FUNDING AND HE GETS\nSOMETHING PASSED THAT SAYS YOU'RE DONE UNTIL YOU COMPLY\nWITH THE LAW AND INQUIRE ABOUT IMMIGRATION STATUS OR ENFORCE\nTHE I.C.E. DETAINERS, IT'S A SHOW OF WILL AGAINST BETWEEN THE\nFEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE STATE.\n>> LOOK AT HOW HARD UP THE CITIES ARE FOR CASH.\nTHE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S GOING TO BE DANGLING BILLIONS, THEY'RE\nGOING TO CAVE ON THIS BECAUSE THEY'LL WANT THE CASH.\nAND IF THEY DON'T CAVE AND DON'T GET THE CASH, THERE'LL BE\nTREMENDOUS LOCAL POLITICAL PRESSURE ON THEM TO DO SO, BUT\nTHEY ARE LEGALLY AND CONSTITUTIONALLY WITHIN THEIR\nRIGHT TO SAY TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, WE'RE NOT GOING TO\nWORK FOR YOU. >> GREAT TO SEE YOU, JUDGE.\n>> THANK YOU. >> JOINING ME MORE ON THE\nPOLITICS, DAVID WOOL, TRUMP SUPPORTER AND ATTORNEY AND\nJULIE, DEMOCRATIC ANL GIST AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR.\n>> POLITICALLY, YOU TELL ME WHETHER THIS IS A TEST.\nTHIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST BIG TESTS FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP IF\nTHESE MAYORS AND THESE VARIOUS CITIES, NEW YORK, L.A., SEATTLE,\nPHILADELPHIA, SAN FRANCISCO, AND CHICAGO DEFY HIM, DAVID.\n>> YEAH, I HAVE NO DOUBT ABOUT IT, MEGYN.\nTHIS IS MORE THAN JUST THE MAYOR AND THE POLICE CHIEF IN LOS\nANGELES FOR EXAMPLE, CHOOSING FEDERAL LAW OR STATE LAW OR VICE\nVERSA. THEY'RE CREATING POLICIES THAT\nARE IN COMPLETE PREVENTION OF ANY LAW.\nAND WHAT THEY'RE DOING, THEY'RE DOING IT FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES.\nOBVIOUSLY THEY WANT VOTES FROM THE PEOPLE THEY FEEL THAT\nTHEY'RE PROTECTING AND I GOT TO SAY, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT GOING TO\nWORK BECAUSE TRUMP'S GOING TO COME AFTER HIM.\nHE WANTS THESE PEOPLE OUT OF THE COUNTRY, TWO TO THREE MILLION\nVIOLENT CRIMINALS WHO THEM GONE. CUT OFF FUNDING, ALSO PROSECUTE\nFOR OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE FOR AIDING AND ABETHING A FELON.\nFOR -- WITH ACCESSORY TO AFTER THE FACT.\nSO MANY FELONY CHARGES THAT COULD BE BROUGHT BY THE NEW\nATTORNEY GENERAL -- >> NOT FOR JUST NOT INQUIRING\nABOUT IMMIGRATION STATUS. YOU CAN'T PROSECUTE THEM FOR\nTHAT. >> FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN THEY'RE\nRELEASED FOR JAIL, THEY HAVE A HOLD THAT THEY IGNORE.\nIT'S ACTIVELY OBSTRUCTING THE FEDS FROM CARRYING OUT THE\nRESPONSIBILITIES THAT LEADS TO MUCH MORE --\n>> NOT CARRYING OUT THE I.C.E. CONTAIN PER.\n>> NEGLIGENCE. >> IMMIGRA\nRUN IN THERE AND DETAIN EVERYBODY.\nTHEY ISSUE THE DETAINER AND RELYING ON THE\nGUY GETS ARRESTED, DETAIN HIM. SO YOU TELL ME HOW YOU SEE IT.\n>> WELL, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT SANCTUARY CITIES DON'T\nJUST INCLUDE VIOLENT CRIMINALS WHICH WE ALL AGREE SHOULD BE\nLOCKED UP AND I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH SUPPORTING THOSE THAT ARE\nTRULY VIOLENT. NOT PEOPLE WHO COULD PICKET, BUT\nPEOPLE WHO COMMIT VIOLENT CRIMES.\nYOU'RE A 15-YEAR-OLD GIRL WHOSE PARENTS ARE HERE ILLEGALLY, YOU\nGET ASSAULTED, YOU'RE AFRAID YOUR PARENTS ARE GOING TO BE\nPOTENTIALLY BE ARRESTED, DETAINED, AND DEPORT BHPD YOU'RE\nTALKING ABOUT SANCTUARY CITIES, LET'S NOT JUST TALK ABOUT THE\nVIOLENT CRIMINALS WHICH WE ALL AGREE SHOULD BE PROSECUTED AND\nSHOULD BE DETAINED AND DEPORTED, BUT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE\nWHO ARE HERE WHO ARE NOT -- >> BUT THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT\nJULIE, THE FLIPSIDE OF THAT IS THE TOLERANCE FOR PEOPLE, THIS\nIS THE OTHER SIDE WHO ARE IN THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY, WE SEE\nSITUATIONS LIKE FRANCISCO HERNANDEZ WHO MURDERED KATE AND\nSO, THE PEOPLE WHO WANT THIS POLICY SAY IT'S NOT WORTH IT.\nTHEY HAVE EMPATHY FOR THE 15-YEAR-OLD GIRL, BUT THEY HAVE\nEMPATHY FOR KATE AND HER FAMILY TOO.\n>> I HAVE TREMENDOUS EMPATHY FOR KATE, HE NEVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN\nRELEASED -- >> BUT HE WAS, IN A SANCTUARY\nCITY. >> NO QUESTION --\n>> YEAH -- >> HE WAS, LET ME JUST FINISH\nTHIS, HE WAS AND SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN.\nHE WAS OOFBL CRIMINAL, BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT THAT 15-YEAR-OLD\nGIRL AND THERE ARE MANY MORE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAN VIOLENT\nCRIMINALS WHO WILL BE SCARED TO COOPERATE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT\nCRIMINALS -- >> OTHER CRIMES WOULD GO UP.\n>> PRECISELY FOR SANCTUARY CITIES, PRECISELY ALLOW PEOPLE\nLIKE THE MAN WHO MURDERED KATE TO STAY THERE WITHOUT FEAR OF\nBEING DEPORTED AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM.\nMR. TRUMP IS GOING ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS WILL NOT DEPORT THE\nYOUNG GIRL. RATHER THE TWO TO THREE MILLION\nVIOLENT CRIMINALS AND BARACK OBAMA BY THE WAY IGNORED\nCOMPLETELY. >> NO, EXCUSE ME, DEPORTED MORE\nPEOPLE THAN THOSE UNDER HIM. >> THEY ARE LARGELY CATCH AND\nRELEASE AT THE BORDER. WE HAVE TO LEAVE IT AT THAT.\nTHANK YOU BOTH.", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1479192542083.1479188634660.0399fee9-a534-4ba3-a941-cb0b5ddef35c.segment7.thumb.jpg", "channel": "360"}, {"start": 1161959.0, "length": 334579.0, "end": 1496538, "date": 1479206259668, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1479209691367.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1479206245837-5aff6981-53c3-4adc-9455-2dd439f62cc3-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=1161.96,1496.54", "text": ">> IT IS TUESDAY NOVEMBER 15TH.

BECKY QUICK JUST SPOKE WITH\nWARREN AND JOINS US WITH DETAILS.\n>> BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY FCC FILINGS THAT JUST CAME OUT SHOW\nTHAT THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN A STAKE IN THREE OF THE FOUR MAJOR\nAIRLINES. THAT WOULD BE AMERICAN, UNITED\nAND DELTA. BUT WE CAN REPORT THAT WARREN\nBUFFETT HAS ALSO TAKEN A STAKE, BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY I SHOULD SAY\nIS THE FOURTH MAJOR CARRIER AS WELL, AND THAT IS SOUTHWEST.\nTHIS MOVE INTO AIRLINES IS A SPRET HOBING REVERSAL FOR\nBUFFETT. IF YOU FOLLOW HIM, HE HAS\nSHUNNED THE INDUSTRY FOR AT LEAST TWO DECADES EVER SINCE HE\nMADE THE BIG VOLATILE INVESTMENT IN US AIRWAYS BACK IN 1989.\nTHAT WAS PREFERRED SHARES OF US AIRWAYS.\nBUFFETT BOUGHT $358 MILLION WORTH.\nBUT BY 1994, THEY HAD WRITTEN DOWN THAT INVESTMENT TO $89.5\nMILLION. THAT IS JUST 25 CENTS ON THE\nDOLLAR OF THE ORIGINAL INVESTMENT.\nFOR BUFFETT, THIS WAS A PRETTY PAINFUL EXPERIENCE.\nHE WROTE ABOUT IT AS A MISTAKE IN ALMOST EVERY ANNUAL LETTER.\nONLY ONE YEAR WHERE HE DIDN'T MENTION I AND IN THE END\nBERKSHIRE MADE ABOUT $250 MILLION PLUS THE ORIGINAL THAT\nTHEY PUT IN. BUT THE EXPERIENCE ITSELF WAS\nENOUGH TO SOUR BUFFETT ON AIRLINES FOR AGAIN ALMOST TWO\nDECADES THAT HAVE PASSED SINCE THAT TIME.\nBUFFETT HAS SPOKEN OUT ABOUT THIS ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT\nOCCASIONS ABOUT HOW MUCH HE HATES THE AIRLINES, HOW HE\nWOULDN'T GO NEAR THESE INVESTMENTS.\nAND HE'S SLAMMED THE AIRLINE STOCKS IN HIS ANNUAL LETTERS,\nTOO. IN FACT IF YOU GO BACK TO 2007\nAND THAT AIRLINE LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS, HE WROTE, QUOTE,\nTHE WORST SORT OF BUSINESS IS ONE THAT GROWS RAPIDLY, REQUIRES\nSIGNIFICANT TO ENGENDER THE GROWTH AND THEN HE WERES LITTLE\nOR NO MONEY. THINK AIRLINES.\nHERE IS A DURABLE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE PROVEN ILLUSIVE SINCE\nTHE DAYS OF THE WRIGHT BROTHERS. INDEED IF A FAR SIGHTED\nCAPITALIST HAD BEEN PRESENT IT THE KATIE HAWK, WOULD HE HAVE\nDONE HIS SUCCESSORS A HUGE FAVOR BY SHOOTING ORVILLE OIG DOWN.\nYOU MIGHT ASK WHAT HAS CHANGED AND I DID.\nBUFFETT SAID HE WON'T SAY WHAT THEY WERE THINKING ABOUT WITH\nTHIS INVESTMENT, THAT IS A SELF IMPOSED RULE THAT BERKSHIRE\nHATHAWAY HAS HAD, THEY DON'T REALLY TALK ABOUT THEIR\nINVESTMENTS, BUT HE IS BREAKING HIS SILENCE ON THIS PARTICULAR\nINVESTMENT. NOW, THE S.E.C. FILINGS ONLY\nSHOW INVESTMENTS THAT BERKSHIRE MADE THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30th AND\nTHAT SOUTHWEST AIRLINES STAKE WAS MADE JUST AFTER SEPTEMBER\n30th. AND AGAIN, USUALLY BUFFETT WILL\nNOT TALK ABOUT ANY OF THESE SORTS OF ISSUES, BUT HE'S\nSPEAKING OUT BECAUSE OF HIS FRIENDSHIP WITH HERB KELLEHER,\nONE OF THE CO-FOUNDERS MUCH SOUTHWEST. BUFFETT TOLD ME HE RAN INTO\nKELLEHER LAST MONTH AND HE STARTED JOKING AROUND ABOUT THE\nAIRLINES. OBVIOUSLY HE NEVER MENTIONED\nWHAT HE HAD BEEN DOING WITH THE STOCKS, BUT HE SAID THAT HE\nWOULD FEEL TERRIBLE IF KELLEHER SAW THE FILINGS RELEASED AND\nTHAT HE HAD NOT BEEN INVESTING IN HIS.\nHE WOULD FEEL TERRIBLE IF HE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS SHUNNING IT,\nIN A BERKSHIRE WAS INVESTING IN ALL THE MAJOR AIRLINES EXCEPT\nSOUTHWEST AS IF THERE WAS SOME REASON HE WAS AVOIDING IT, SO HE\nWANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WORD GOT OUT THAT HE IS\nINVESTING IN ALL FOUR, NOT JUST THE THREE REFLECTED IN THE\nS.E.C. FILINGS THAT ARE OUT THERE.\nAND SO THAT IS JUST WHY WE HAVE THESE NEWS.\nSO NOT JUST THE THREE, BUT ALSO SOUTHWEST AS WELL.\n>> THIS IS SUCH A WONDERFUL STORY.\nSO A LOT OF PEOPLE RAISE THEIR EYE BROWS WHEN BERKSHIRE BOUGHT\nIBM AND EVEN FURTHER WHEN THEY BOUGHT APPLE.\nTHE FACT THAT HE'S BUYING THE AIRLINES NOW, TO BE FAIR, ONE OF\nMY FAVORITE QUOTES IS THE ONE ANY YEAR IN WHICH YOU HAVEN'T\nCHANGED YOUR MIND ON SOMETHING MAJOR IS A WASTED YEAR, BUT THIS\nIS LIKE -- I MEAN THE PART THAT YOU RED ABOUT KITTY HAWK, IT\nGETS RIGHT TO IT. DID HE PROVIDE ANY CLARITY, WAS\nIT A BUFFETT DRIVEN INVESTMENT? >> HE SAID IT CAME FROM ONE OF\nTHE THREE OF THEM, IF THIS BECAUSE HIS OR TODD OR TED'S,\nONE OF HIS TWO DEPUTIES. HE SAID IT CAME FROM ONE OF\nTHREE OF THEM. ABOUT HE WON'T BE MORE SPECIFIC.\nBUT AGAIN, BERKSHIRE IS IN ON ALL FOUR AIRLINES.\nTHE AMOUNTS THAT ARE PLACED ARE CERTAINLY NOT MASSIVE AMOUNTS.\nIF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE HOLDINGS THEY'RE TALKING\nABOUT, I THINK WE HAVE A CHART THAT SHOWS YOU SOME OF WHAT WENT\nTHROUGH WITH THIS. THESE ARE ANYWHERE LIKE $200\nMILLION TO $300 MILLION INVESTMENTS IN THESE.\nAND IN FACT ONE WAS A BIGGER. >> THE AMERICAN ONE.\n>> AMERICAN WAS CLOSER TO $1 BILLION, I WILL.\nYEAH, THE $994 MILLION. SO AGAIN, THESE ARE LARGE\nINVESTMENTS UNLESS YOU LOOK AT THE SIZE OF BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY.\nSO THIS COULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF HIS DEPUTIES WHO DID IT, BUT\nBUFFETT IS MAKING THESE COMMENTS.\nAND YOU'RE RIGHT, THIS IS AN INDUSTRY THAT HE'S STAYED FAR\nAWAY FROM AND ANOTHER INVESTOR THAT YOU AND I BOTH KNOW WELL IS\nBILL MILLER.
