TRUMP.\n>> SURE. >> QUICK ASSESS.\n>> IN GENERAL, FOR SOMEBODY WHO'S THAT AGE WHO HAD HIGH\nCHOLESTEROL IN THE PAST WHO LIKES FAST FOOD YOU'D SCREEN FOR\nHEART DISEASE TO MAKE SURE THAT CARDIO\nCARDIOVASCULARLY, THAT PERSON IS OKAY.\n>> SHE SAYS HE SPEAKS TO 45,000 PERSON CROWD AND THAT'S\nEXERCISE. YOUR ASSESSMENT?\n>> WALKING A LOT IS. WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT PEOPLE\nHAVING A SEDENTARY LIFE-STYLE BUT THERE'S NO STANDARD HISTORY\nIN PHYSICAL EXAM. THERE'S THREE DIFFERENT WAYS\nDOCTORS APPROACH IT. FIRST THEY LOOK AT THE SYMPTOMS\nPEOPLE ARE REPORTING SO FOR HIM THE FOCUS WOULD BE A LITTLE MORE\nON HIS CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH. THEN PEOPLE DO GENERAL SCREENING\nTESTS SO FOR EXAMPLE WHAT KIND OF TESTS WOULD YOU DO WITH THAT\nPERSON AND THEN THERE'S A THIRD TYPE OF TEST WHERE YOU HAVE A\nPRE-OP TEST, CAN YOU STAND THE STRESS OF PRESIDENCY AND DO MORE\nINTENSIVE TESTS BASED ON THAT. >> SO WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE\nWAS TOLD TO HOP ON A TREADMILL, BLOOD TESTS THAT KIND OF THING,\nWE DON'T HAVE THAT.

SHE KEEPS TRIPPING INTO THESE\nCHARACTER MINE FIELDS. WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THESE\nE-MAIL REVELATIONS, CHRIS? >> WELL, I HAVE TO SAY, I MAKE\nMORE OF WHAT POWELL IS SAYING ABOUT CLINTON.\nPOWELL HAS BECOME A REPUBLICAN IN NAME ONLY.\nIF YOU REMEMBER HE SUPPORTED BARACK OBAMA AGAINST McCAIN IN\n2008, OBAMA AGAINST ROMNEY IN 2012, SO NO SURPRISE THAT HE\nWOULD NOT -- THE LANGUAGE IS KIND OF TOUGH, BUT NO SURPRISE\nTHAT HE WOULDN'T HAVE MUCH USE FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nBUT YOU CAN TELL, HE IS GENUINELY UPSET BY THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGNS. AND IT HAS BEEN AN EFFORT ON\nTHEIR PART TO SAY WELL SHE WAS JUST FOLLOWING THE ADVICE OF\nCOLON POWELL WHEN SHE SAID UP THIS PRIVATE SYSTEM.\nTHE FACT IS, THEY WERE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS.\nPOWELL DIDN'T HAVE A PRIVATE SERVER IN HIS BASEMENT, HE WAS\nUSING AOL.COM BACK IN 2005, OR 2000 RATHER, BACK WHEN THE WHOLE\nE-MAIL SYSTEM AND THE INTERNET WAS ALL COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.\nSO, YOU KNOW, I THINK WITH SOME JUSTICE, HE IS UPSET AT THE\nIDEAS. HE IS TRYING TO DRAG HIM INTO\nTHIS AND MAKE IT SEEM LIKE HE WAS THE REASON THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON SET UP THE PRIVATE SERVER.\n>> THERE WAS ALSO AN E-MAIL EXCHANGE WITH A DEMOCRATIC E\nMEGA DONOR, JEFFREY LEADS WAS IN THERE DEPICTING HER AS A SORE\nLOSER WHEN SHE LOST TO BARACK OBAMA SAYING SHE HATES THAT THE\nPRESIDENT KICKED HER BUTT IN 2008.\nSHE USED A DIFFERENT WORD THERE, BUT HE WENT ON TO SAY NO ONE\nLIKES HER AND THE CRIMINAL THING AIN'T OVER.\nI DON'T THINK THE PRESIDENT WOULD WEEP IF SHE FOUND HERSELF\nIN REAL LEGAL TROUBLE. WAS THIS ALSO VERY REVEALING OF\nTHE JITTERS THAT THE PARTY, THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN GENERAL IS\nFEELING RIGHT NOW OVER HILLARY CLINTON AND RECENT POLLING?\n>> OH SURE. LOOK, THIS RACE IS TIGHTENING,\nAND IT'S TIGHTENING I THINK FOR TWO REASONS.\nONE, DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN A MORE DISCIPLINED, BETTER\nCANDIDATE OVER THE LAST THREE, FOUR WEEKS SINCE HIS NEW TEAM\nTOOK OVER, AND AGAIN, THIS GOES TO THE PERSONALITY TRANSPLANT.\nHE IS DELIVERING MORE SPEECHES ON TELEPROMPTER, MORE POLICY IN\nHIS SPEECHES. YOU KNOW, THERE'VE BEEN SOME\nBUMPS IN THE ROAD, FOR INSTANCE GOING DOWN TO MEXICO, HAVING\nTHAT MEETING WITH THE MEXICAN PRESIDENT, THEN COMING BACK AND\nSEEMING TO GO BACK ON THE IDEA HE WAS GOING TO SOFTEN HIS\nPOSITION ON IMMIGRATION AND IN FACT DELIVERING A HARD LINE\nPOSITION, BUT MEANWHILE, THE NEWS HAS BEEN ALMOST ALL BAD FOR\nHILLARY CLINTON FOR SEVERAL WEEKS NOW.\nMORE REVELATIONS ABOUT THE E-MAIL, THE FBI 15,000 E-MAILS\nTHEY WERE ABLE TO RECOVER, THE COZY CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION, THE STATE DEPARTMENT, NOW THE HEALTH\nSCARE. SO NOT SURPRISINGLY ALL OF THIS\nHAS LED TO HIS RISE IN THE POLLS AND HER DECLINE.\nSTILL, VERY MUCH SHE'S STILL THE FAVORITE, BUT IF HE IS AHEAD BY\nFIVE POINTS IN OHIO, THAT'S A VERY TELLING SIGN.\nTHAT IS A, YOU KNOW, THE SWINGINGEST OF SWING STATES AND\nONE THAT THE REPUBLICANS ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO HAVE.\n>> THERE IS SO MUCH GOING ON IN THIS HORSE RACE AND YOU HAVE\nINTERESTING GUESTS ON FOX NEWS SUNDAY.\nWHO DO YOU HAVE? >> TOP OFFICIALS OF BOTH THE\nTRUMP AND CLINTON COMPANIES, BUT ALSO WE'RE GOING TO TALK TO\nGEORGE CLOONEY AND JOHN PRENDERGST.\nFASCINATING INVESTIGATION THEY'VE UNDERTAKEN.\nTHE HUMAN RIGHTS IN AFRICA, THEY HAVE SET UP SOMETHING CALLED THE\nCENTURY WHICH IS UNCOVERED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THEFT AND\nCORRUPTION IN SOUTH SUDAN.

PEOPLE SOUNDED FEARFUL YESTERDAY\nTHAT THE END OF THE CREDIT CYCLE WAS APPROACHING AN END.\nARE YOU AS WORRIED AS THEY ARE? >> YOU KNOW, I'M NOT REALLY.\nI THINK THERE IS A CROWDED TRADE THAT IS OUT THERE, IT IS IN THIS\nLOW VOLATILITY SAFETY TRADE AND YOU SEE AN INCREDIBLE RUSH OF\nCAPITAL TO THIS. AND WHAT THAT HAS MEANT IS THAT\nSTOCKS AREN'T BEING PRICED FOR GROWTH.\nYOU KNOW, THERE IS GROWTH, WHERE IT IS OPEN ENDED AND SECULAR.\nAT THE SAME TIME, YOU'VE GOT STOCKS THAT ARE REFLECTING\nDISTRESS ASSET PRICES. WHEN THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE\nDRAMATICALLY BETTER. FOR MY VIEW, WE'RE FINDING GREAT\nOPPORTUNITIES BOTH IN GREAT SECULAR GROWTH STORIES AROUND\nTHE WORLD, AS WELL AS REALLY INTERESTING DEEP VALUE STOCKS\nTHAT ARE -- WHERE THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY\nBETTER THAN THE SHARE PRICES REFLECT.\n>> BREXIT, NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES, POPULISM, THE RISE OF THE\nRIGHT WING, WE GOT ALL THESE THINGS, GEORGE THAT HAVE NEVER\nHAPPENED BEFORE. IS THERE ANY HISTORICAL GUIDE?\nCAN YOU LOOK BACK AT ANY TEXTBOOK AND SAY THIS IS WHAT I\nSHOULD DO NOW? >> NO.\nSO I THINK THAT'S WHAT HAS GOT EVERYONE SO UNEASY.\nALL OF THESE THINGS PUT US IN A PLACE WE HAVE NEVER BEEN BEFORE,\nTHAT'S WHAT CREATED THIS ANXIETY.\n>> HERE IS WHAT I FOUND INTERESTING, ESPECIALLY BILL\nMILLER SAID LONG THE S&P, SHORT THE TEN-YEAR TREASURY, HE SAID\nTHE TEN-YEAR WAS SO OVERVALUED, IT REMINDED HIM OF STOCKS IN\nSEPTEMBER OF 1987, JUST BEFORE THE CRASH.\nIT WAS THAT -- SO HUGE. HERE IS WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.\nIF YOU THINK BONDS ARE IN A BUBBLE, INTEREST RATES ARE GOING\nTO RISE. ISN'T THAT GOING TO BE BAD FOR\nSTOCKS. >> THAT'S THE HISTORICAL PLAY\nBOOK. IF WE WERE PLAYING OFF\nHISTORICAL PARADIGM, THAT'S WHAT WOULD HAPPEN.\nTHAT'S NOT THE CASE NOW. THE REASON RATES ARE SO LOW IS\nBECAUSE THERE ARE ALL THESE CONCERNS ABOUT NO GROWTH IN THE\nENVIRONMENT, NO INFLATION. IF WE GET RATES GOING UP, IT IS\nA SIGN OF GROWTH, A SIGN OF INFLATION.\nTHAT'S ACTUALLY VERY HEALTHY FOR EQUITIES.\n>> IF YOU LOOK, JACK, I'LL BRING YOU IN HERE ON THIS\nCONVERSATION, YOU KNOW, THIS NOTION THAT PEOPLE ARE LOOK FOR\nYIELD, RIGHT, THAT'S WHY PEOPLE WENT INTO DIVIDEND YIELDING\nSTOCKS, LOOK AT THE SECTORS IN THE S&P 500, EIGHT OF THE TEN\nARE YIELDING HIGHER THAN THE TEN-YEAR YIELD.\nSO WHEN YIELDS GO UP, THERE IS GOING TO BE THIS RUSH OF MONEY.\nGEORGE HAD MENTIONED THE LOW VOLATILITY FUNDS.\nTHOSE ARE THE FUNDS IN THIS PARTICULAR TRADE.\nAREN'T THINGS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THIS TIME IN TERMS OF WHAT HAS\nGOTTEN US HERE AS PEOPLE SEARCH FOR YIELD AND PUSH THE\nVALUATIONS HIGHER ON THESE SECTORS LIKE UTILITIES AND\nTELECOMS AND STAPLES? >> I THINK IT IS A CONSEQUENCE\nOF, YOU KNOW, WE HANDED OFF TO THE CENTRAL BANKS TO SAY, HERE,\nFIX IT, WE GOT LOW GROWTH AND WANT HIGHER GROWTH.\nAND, YOU KNOW, IN MANY RESPECTS, JUST LIKE PUTTING SAND IN THE\nSHORE AND GETTING STYMIED WHEN THE TIDE COMES BACK IN.\nI THINK WHAT IT HAS DONE HAS CERTAINLY CREATED A WEDGE\nBETWEEN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND THE -- AND MAINSTREAM.\nAND SO AS A RESULT OF THAT, INVESTORS ARE LOOKING FOR\nYIELD -- WILLING TO TAKE MORE RISKS THAT THEY'RE ACCUSTOMED TO\nTAKING. WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND, ANY\nCRISIS THAT RESULTS FROM THIS IS REALLY A CONTRIVED CRISIS.\nTHIS ISN'T A METEOR COMING OUT OF OUTER SPACE AND HITTING THE\nEARTH THAT WE CAN'T GET OUT IN FRONT OF.\nTHIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN CREATED BY THE CENTRAL BANKS AND\nWE HAVE TO WORK OUR WAY OUT. I DON'T THINK THIS IS\nNECESSARILY THE NEXT, YOU KNOW, CRISIS THAT IS GOING TO CREATE A\nHUGE CRATER. >> ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT I\nHEARD YESTERDAY AND I BELIEVE IT WAS PAUL SINGER WHO MADE IT AND\nALSO MR. DALIO WHO MADE IT AND THAT WAS THAT WHAT THE CENTRAL\nBANKS HAVE DONE IS TRY TO CREATE GROWTH BY KEEPING INTEREST RATES\nLOW. IT HASN'T WORKED OR ARGUABLE\nTHEY HAVE CREATED GROWTH. BUT IT IS NOT ARGUABLE THAT THEY\nHAVE NOT SUPPORTED THE PRICES OF ASSETS, BONDS AND STOCKS.\nAND IF THOSE -- IF THEY STOP DOING THAT, WHAT DOES THAT SAY\nABOUT THE VALUES OF STOCKS AND BONDS?\n>> PERFECT, I AGREE. STOCKS AND BONDS ARE EXPENSIVE.\nTHERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. THE FACT IS THAT McDONALD'S WAS\nABLE TO ISSUE A TEN-YEAR NOTE IN EUROPE AT 0.75% A FEW MONTHS\nAGO. I CAN ASSURE YOU, NO -- GIVEN\nTHAT McDONALD'S BONDS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE TRADING AT NEARLY 3%\nFOR THE SAME MATURITY, WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO BUY A McDONALD'S\nBOND AT 0.75%, BECAUSE THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK IS BUYING\nIT ALL. INVESTORS AREN'T BUYING THAT.\nAND McDONALD'S IS TAKING THAT MONEY BACK HERE AND BUYING BACK\nTHEIR OWN SHARES. SO THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT\nCENTRAL BANKS RUNNING INTERFERENCE AND CREATING HIGH VALUATIONS, BUT THE FACT IS,\nTHEY'RE NOT GOING TO NECESSARILY TURN OFF THE SPIGOT AND RUN\nAWAY. THEY RECOGNIZE THAT, YOU KNOW,\nTHERE IS AN ADDICTION HERE, AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SLOWLY\nGET OFF OF THIS LIQUIDITY, BUT DO IT IN A GRADUAL WAY.\n>> MICHELLE HAD MENTIONED GOING LONG STOCKS, AND SHORT G-7\nBONDS, BUT WHEN THIS -- WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT STOPS, WHEN\nTHE MERRY-GO-ROUND STOPS, WON'T ALL ASSET CLASSES GO DOWN?\nTHERE IS A BANK OF AMERICA, MERRILL LYNCH FUND SURVEY\nRELEASED YESTERDAY, 54% OF FUND MANAGERS SAY BOTH STOCKS AND\nBONDS ARE OVERVALUED AT THIS POINT.\nAND WE'RE JUST LAYING OUT, YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE LOW\nVOLATILITY FUNDS, PUSHING UP THE VALUATIONS.\nTHERE IS THIS THOUGHT THERE IS NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE ESSENTIALLY\nPUSHING THAT TRADE HIGHER. HOW IS IT GOING TO END?\nARE WE GOING TO SEE A REVERSION WHERE WE HAVE THAT BREAK IN\nCORRELATION? >> I THINK YOU CAN HAVE, YOU\nKNOW, SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN FIXED INCOME MARKETS AND EQUITY\nMARKETS AND HAVE EQUITY SECTORS DO VERY WELL.\nYOU HARKEN BACK TO THE YEAR 2000, WHEN THE MARKETS WERE TO\nBE KIND A DISASTER, FINANCIALS WERE UP 50% THAT YEAR.\nSO YOU CAN HAVE SECTORS THAT HAVE BEEN OVERSOLD OR\nUNDERAPPRECIATED DO EXTREMELY WELL IN A DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT.\nYOU TALK ABOUT EQUITY MARKETS OVERVALUED, 17 TIMES EARNINGS\nFOR THE S&P 500, HISTORICALLY THAT'S VERY, VERY HIGH.\nIT IS NOT HIGH RELATIVE TO FIXED INCOME AT THIS CURRENT TIME.\nAND AT THE SAME TOKEN, THERE IS SECTORS WITHIN THE S&P 500 THAT\nARE EXTRAORDINARILY CHEAP. YOU CAN LOOK AT FINANCIALS THAT\nARE TRADING DISTRESS BUT AREN'T. OR LOOK AT CHINESE INTERNET\nPLAYS. ALIBABA TRADES AT THE SAME\nMULTIPLE AS THE REGULATED U.S. UTILITY, THAT DOESN'T MAKE\nSENSE. SO YOU CAN SEE THIS UNWIND OF\nTHE SAFETY, THIS LOW VOLATILITY TRADE, CREATING TREMENDOUS\nOPPORTUNITIES IF YOU'RE ACTIVE. >> JAY JACK, YESTERDAY, MAY NOT\nHAVE SEEMED LIKE SOME SORT OF A RED LETTER DAY, BUT TO ME AND\nSOME OTHERS, VERY INTERESTING MOVES BECAUSE IT DOESN'T GET A\nLOT OF ATTENTION, NOT SEXY, DOESN'T SCREAM AT YOU, THE\nTEN-YEAR YIELD ROSE BY 3%, THE S&P FELL BY 1%, A VERY RARE DIVERSION.\nDID YESTERDAY ESTABLISH SOMETHING NEW?\n>> I DO THINK THAT FAIR VALUE FOR THE TEN-YEAR TREASURY IS\nHIGHER IN YIELD THAN WHERE IT IS RIGHT NOW.\nIF YOU LOOK AT NOMINAL GDP, WHICH IS RELATIVELY LOW, THAT'S\nAT 2.7%, NOT 1.7%. THAT'S HISTORICALLY BEEN A\nPRETTY GOOD PROXY FOR WHERE THE TEN-YEAR TREASURY OUGHT TO BE.\nSO, YEAH, I WOULD SAY WE COULD GET 100 BASIS POINT RISE OUT OF\nTHE TEN-YEAR TREASURY AND THAT IT WILL CERTAINLY CREATE SOME\nDISRUPTION. BUT, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT\nSUGGESTING THAT -- OR I DON'T THINK ANYONE IS SUGGESTING THAT\nFAIR VALUE FOR THE TEN-YEAR IS 3.5% OR 4% OR SOMETHING LIKE\nTHAT. >> GEORGE MARIS, JACK, THANK YOU\nBOTH VERY MUCH.

BUT THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT WOULD\nBE ISN'T THAT A SHOT ACROSS THE BOW MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE?\nWOULD YOU WANT TO BE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE POTENTIAL OF\nTHAT? >> NO, BUT MY POINT IS I DON'T\nTHINK HE HAS ANY INTENTION TO GO TO 50% OR ANY INTENTION\nNECESSARILY TO GO TO 30%.

VOILA, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT\nHAPPENED. THE ACTION OF VOLATILITY INDEX\nIS INTERPRETED BY OUR EXPERT, MARK SEBASTIAN, SUGGESTING\nTURBULENCE IS FAR FROM OVER. KEEP AN EYE ON THE VIX.\nIF IT STARTS TO GO DOWN ALONG WITH THE S&P 500 THAT COULD\nSIGNAL THE FEAR OF THE FED HAS FINALLY BAKED IN AND IS TIME TO\nSTART BUYING. IT'S NOT YET, THOUGH.\nFOR NOW, AS I'VE BEEN STRESSING FOR WEEKS, IT JUST AIN'T WORTH\nTHE RISK TO BE A HERO. THE REWARD'S NOT THERE.\nFIX YOUR EYES ON THE VIX. THERE COULD BE SERIOUS\nIMPLICATIONS.

NO, CHECK THAT.\nTHE INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY LAST MONTH ANNOUNCED THEY\nTHOUGHT THE BIG OIL GLUT WAS EASING.\nCAME OUT THIS MORNING AND SAID IT WASN'T EASY.\nOIL GOT HAMMERED MERCILESSLY.

MORE ON THAT IN A MOMENT WHEN WE\nINTERVIEW CEO JOHN STUFF. THE MARKET TOOK ITS CUE FROM\nWELLS IN SOME WILEYS. NEVER MIND THE EARLY READ ON\nAPPLE'S. SO I SNEEZE.\nANYWAY, SORRY, TIM COOK, RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF WHAT I WAS\nSAYING ABOUT APPLE BUT APPLE'S NEW iPHONE WHERE T-MOBILE AND\nSPRINT SAID THE LAUNCH IS MUCH, MUCH BETTER THAN EXPECTED AND I\nHAVE BEEN CHECKING AROUND AND LET'S SAY VERIZON AND AT&T SEEM\nTO SEE A VERY SIMILAR DEMAND. WHAT DO YOU DO HERE?\nSOMETIMES THE CASE IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.\nTHAT WAS TODAY WHEN I LISTENED TO MONEY MANAGER BILL MILLER AT\nDELIVERING ALPHA. I STILL REGARD THAT AS A GREAT\nBENCHMARK, HE DID SOMETHING BECAUSE THE TEN-YEAR BOND\nYIELDED 9% AND SIX-MONTH TREASURY BILL WORTH 6%.\nTHESE DAYS, FIXED INCOME, ACCOUNT STOCKS, DIFFERENT\nPICTURE. UNCOMPETITIVE 1.73% AND\nSIX-MOBILE .53%. EVEN THOUGH THE SAIP 500 IS MORE\nEXPENSIVE NOW THAN A PRICED EARNINGS BASIS THEN, HE TOLD THE\nCROWD THAT STOCKS ARE, AND I QUOTE, STUPIDLY CHEAP WHILE\nBONDS ARE RIDICULOUSLY OVERPRICED.\nHE REMINDED US, AND I QUOTE AGAIN, OUTLOOK FOR THE U.S.\nECONOMY IS SOLID. AMONG THE BEST IN THE WORLD.\nLOW INFLATION AND LOW UNEMPLOYMENT.\nRECORD PRODUCTS, RECORD GDP, RECORD HOUSEHOLD NET WORTH,ANT\nQUOTE. HE WANTS TO SELL BONDS AND BUY\nSTOCKS FOR THOSE REASONS. TIM DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH TO UPSET\nTHE PICTURE. I WENT TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF\nCAUTION. I DON'T WANT TO RISK MAKING A\nBIG BET HERE ON STOCKS. RIGHT NOW I PREFER TO HAVE A\nHIGHER CASH POSITION AS I HAVE FOR MY CHARITABLE TRUST.\nYOU CAN FOLLOW ALONG ON IT. AND YESTERDAY I SUGGESTED\nRAISING CASH AGAIN WITH WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A GOOD GAME PLAN TO\nSELL INTO THAT STRENGTH. STILL, HERE IS THE BOTTOM LINE.\nI THINK BILL MILLER IS ON TO SOMETHING.\nWHEN THE COMPETITION OF STOCKS IS THAT TERRIBLE, WHEN THINGS\nARE DESCENT OUT THERE, MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T TAKE OUR CUE FROM THE\nLAST FED PLAYER AT BAT. LET ME SEE.\nYEAH. YEAH.\nYOU HAVE THIS CARD. THIS GUY'S CARD.\nTHERE ARE A HUNDRED THOUSAND FEWER BARRELS OF OIL USED\nEVERYDAY. JUST TAKE A TANKER AND STICK A\nHUNDRED THOUSAND BARRELS ON IT. INSTEAD, TAKE OUR CUE FROM THE\nVALUE THAT STOCKS ARE OFFERING AND BY THE WAY, AS THEY COME\nDOWN, THEY GET CHEAPER. NOT MORE EXPENSIVE.\nJANICE IN TEXAS, JANICE? >> HEY, JIM.\n>> HEY, JANICE. >> YAHOO! I BOUGHT ABOUT TWO\nYEARS AGO, BECAUSE I WANTED THE ASIAN EXPOSURE TO THE SEARCH\nINDUSTRY WITH ALI BA BA. >> YES.\n>> I WANT SOME VERIZON, SO SHOULD I STAY OR SHOULD GO?\n>> THAT'S INTERESTING.

THIS COULD BE A SWAP.\nTIME TO SELL YOUR COLLECTION OF FED TRADING CARDS AND LET'S PUT\nA LITTLE LESS EMPHASIS ON THESE GUYS OKAY?\nCOULD THIS GUY TAKE THE MARKET DOWN 400?\nI DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HE ADD CARD UNTIL TODAY.\nINSTEAD FOCUS ON THE VALUES CAN YOU FIND IN THIS INCREASINGLY\nVOLATILE MARKET.

So when my asthma symptoms kept\n          coming back     on my long-term control\n           medicine.    I talked to my doctor and\n     found a missing piece   in my asthma treatment with\n             BREO. Once-daily BREO prevents asthma\n          symptoms.        BREO is for adults with asthma not well controlled  on a long-term asthma control\n           medicine, like an inhaled corticosteroid.   BREO won't replace a rescue\n            inhaler for sudden breathing problems.      BREO opens up airways to help improve breathing for a\n         full 24 hours. BREO contains a type of medicine that increases the risk of death       from asthma problems    and may increase the risk\n     of hospitalization in children and adolescents. BREO is not for people whose    asthma is well controlled\n             on a     long-term asthma control\n           medicine,         like an inhaled\n        corticosteroid.     Once your asthma is well\n          controlled,        your doctor will\n         decide if you          can stop BREO\n        and prescribe a     different asthma control\n           medicine,         like an inhaled\n        corticosteroid.    Do not take BREO more than\n          prescribed.       See your doctor if\n          your asthma        does not improve\n         or gets worse.   Ask your doctor if 24-hour\n              BREO    could be a missing piece\n            for you.

BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT\nCLEAR. >> WHEN THE FED LOWERS RATES,\nTHEY WANT TO SURPRISE THE MARKET AND THEY WANT TO HAVE THAT\nEFFECT ON THE STOCK MARKET OR ON RISK ASSETS IN GENERAL.\nTHEY DON'T WANT TO DO IT THE OTHER WAY, RIGHT?\n>> THEY DON'T -- IF THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT RAISING RATES,\nTHEY DON'T WANT TO SHOCK YOU ON IT.\nTHAT'S WHY THEY HAVE COME OUT OVER THE LAST WEEK AND SAID\nTHAT. >> THE FUTURES ARE PRICEY --\n>> THEY'RE TRYING TO MANIPULATE THAT MARKET.\nTHEY'RE TRYING TO GET THAT MARKET --\n>> WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT? >> THEY DON'T WANT TO RAISE\nRATES. >> GOING BACK TO 1994, GOLDMAN\nSACHS RESEARCH FROM MAY. WHEN THEY LOOKED AT THE 31 RATE\nINCREASES, OKAY? DURING THAT TIME PERIOD, 50%,\nOKAY -- 50% PROBABILITY OF A RATE HIKE 30 DAYS PRYER.\nTHEY DON'T LIKE TO SURPRISE. >> THAT'S MY POINT.\n>> THIS IS WHAT WE'VE GOT. WE GOT THAT ON FRIDAY, THE\nREACTION TODAY. YOU KNOW WHAT'S STRIKING ABOUT\nFRIDAY AND TODAY? >> TELL ME, PLEASE.\n>> THE S&P 500 CLOSED -- WE'RE A FEW POINTS AWAY FROM WHERE WE\nACTUALLY CLOSED ON FRIDAY. THAT'S WHAT THE DAMAGE HAS BEEN.\nROUND TRIP. >> TOTAL ROUND TRIP.\nTO ME THE DAMAGE STARTED WITH SOVEREIGN BONDS.\n>> YES, DEFINITELY. >> IT'S INTERESTING.\nWE HAD KEVIN O'LEARY ON I FORGET WHAT NIGHT LAST WEEK, TALKED\nABOUT WHY HE WANTED TO BE IN EUROPEAN STOCKS BECAUSE THE ECB\nHAD HIS BACK. THE NEXT DAY, THE ECB BASICALLY\nCAME OUT AND SAID, GUESS WHAT, KEVIN O'LEARY, WE NO LONGER HAVE\nYOUR BACK. AND IF YOU LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENED\nTO INTEREST RATES SINCE THEN, THEY HAVE ALL GONE UP IN A\nSIGNIFICANT FASHION. SO I THINK U.S. RATES ARE MORE\nFUNCTION OF WHAT'S HAPPENING OVERSEAS.\nDOESN'T MATTER. GETS YOU TO THE SAME PLACE.\n>> INCLUDING THE GERMAN IT TEN-YEAR BOND.\nWE SAW THAT RISE FROM NEGATIVE. >> NEGATIVE YIELDING BONDS ARE A\nBUBBLE. ALMOST BY DEFINITION.\nIT'S -- IT'S NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.\nAND IT'S -- IT'S HAPPENING NOW. YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE LONG.\nTHOSE TYPE OF FIXED INCOME. I COULD MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT\nON A SELLOFF YOU WANT TO START BUYING TLT ON A RELATIVE VALUE\nBASIS. >> BUYING --\n>> THAT'S WHAT I WOULD DO. I HAVE ABOUT A THIRD OF A\nPOSITION IN TLT RIGHT NOW. AND IF WE GET, LET'S SAY BACK TO\nMAYBE -- IF WE GET TO 180-ISH ON THE TEN-YEAR, I'LL PROBABLY ADD\nA LITTLE MORE TLT, BECAUSE WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THE\nFUNDAMENTALS OF THE ECONOMY ARE DETERIORATING, EVEN IF THE FED\nRAISES. THEN PEOPLE ARE STILL GOING TO\nWANT TO BUY TLT, BECAUSE THE DOLLAR IS GOING TO GO UP.\nWHICH HAS BEEN HAPPENING FOR THE LAST YEAR OR SO.\nSO ON THESE PULL BACKS, THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.\n>> SO THE CROSS CURRENT COMING OUT OF DELIVERING ALPHA TODAY,\nSAYING SELL G 7 BONDS. >> I WOULD RATHER SELL GERMAN\nBONDS AND ITALIAN BONDS. >> I THINK THEY'RE STILL A SAFE\nHAVEN. >> WHAT DO YOU THINK?\n>> I THINK YOU CAN BUY U.S. TREASURIES, DO THE TLT CLOSER TO\n130. I DON'T THINK THAT THEY'RE GOING\nTO GO IN SEPTEMBER OR NOVEMBER. AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT --\nTHEY'VE ALREADY PRICED IN A 25 BASIS POINT MOVE SINCE THE FED\nSTARTED TALKING A LITTLE BIT MORE --\n>> SHORT-TERM BUY ON THE MARKET OVERALL?\nYOU THINK THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GO IN SEPTEMBER --\n>> 2050 IN THE S&P. HIGHER THAN IN MID DECEMBER WHEN\nTHEY DID THE RAISE. AND WE ARE AT 3% FROM THE HIGHS.\nI THINK IF YOU GET THAT SORT OF FIBER CENT PULL BACK --\n>> YOU KNOW WHAT STOOD OUT TODAY?\n>> WHAT STOOD OUT TODAY, MELISSA?\n>> TECHNOLOGY. >> YOU HEARD PETEY OVER THERE\nTALKING ABOUT -- APPLE HAD A HUGE PART OF THAT, NO QUESTION\nABOUT IT. WHAT I THOUGHT ALSO IS\nINTERESTING TODAY. NOT TO -- YOUR QUESTION WAS\nFINANCIALS UNDERPERFORMED, RIGHT?\nYOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT ON A DAY LIKE TODAY, FINANCIALS WOULD BE\nDOWN, BUT NOT DOWN NEARLY AS MUCH.\nI DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS BUT DEFINITELY TOOK OUT.\n>> THE YIELD CURVE STEEPENED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF JULY.\n>> WELLS FARGO. AND THEN I WOULD ADD IN OIL,\nTOO. RIGHT?\nWE KNOW THAT AT SOME POINT OIL STOCKS ARE BECOMING -- NOT A 45,\nPROBABLY BELOW 40. YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME PEOPLE\nTAKING PROFITS IN ANTICIPATION OF THAT.\n>> ALL RIGHT. IT HAS BEEN A BUMPY RIGHT FOR\nINVESTORS IN SEPTEMBER, TO SAY THE LEAST.\nIF YOU WOULD HAVE LISTENED OH OUR NEXT GUEST, YOU WOULD HAVE\nMADE SOME MONEY. THERE IS CLEARLY A CASE WE COULD\nGET AN UPSIDE BREAK OUT HERE, BUT WITH THE LONG STOCK GOING\nINTO THE WORST MONTH SEASONALLY SPEAKING, I THINK THE BIGGER\nTRADE IS TO THE DOWN SIDE. THE NECK LINE HERE, 2130, THAT'S\nTHE POINT YOU DO NOT WANT TO GO BENEATH.\n>> 2130. WE'RE AT 2127 ON THE CLOSE HERE.\nSO IS THE CORRECTION COMING? RICH ROSS OF ISI IS BACK.\nWHAT DO YOU SAY, RICH? >> YEAH, MELISSA.\nTHANKS FOR THAT. YOU'RE TOO KIND.\nOBVIOUSLY THE PROBLEM FOR STOCKS IS BONDS.\nIT'S NOT THE ONLY PROBLEM, BUT LET'S FOCUS ON THAT TODAY.\nTHIS IS YOUR TEN-YEAR YIELD. WE SEE YOU'RE STILL IN A DOWN\nTREND, THIS IS A BIG MOVE IN TERMS OF YIELD FROM 135 ALL THE\nWAY BACK UP TO 175, 176. I HEARD BK REFERENCE THIS.\nYOUR 200-DAY. 180.\nABOVE 180, FORGET ABOUT IT. HERE'S THE CHART THAT MAKES IT\nREAL INTERESTING. THE WEEKLY, THE BIG DOUBLE\nBOTTOM HERE, A FALSE BREAKDOWN TO AN ALL-TIME LOW IN YIELD IS\nTHE MIRROR IMAGE OF THE FALSE BREAKOUT TO AN ALL-TIME HIGH IN\nSTOCKS. JULY OF 2012, THE LAST BOTTOM,\nJULY OF 2016. JULY, BAD TIME FOR A BOTTOM IN\nYIELDS AND A -- >> SORRY TO INTERRUPT.\nWE'RE AWAITING SOME NEWS OUT OF DELIVERING ALPHA.\nBOTTOM LINE, THOUGH, CORRECTION? WHAT DO YOU SEE FOR STOCKS?\n>> BOTTOM LINE, YES. 2050, 2,000 IS WHERE I BECOME\nEXTREMELY INTERESTED. 2050, YOU PROBABLY GET A BOUNCE.\n>> THANKS, RICH ISI. WE WANT TO LISTEN IN ON CARL\nICAHN BEING INTERVIEWED BY SCOTT WAPNER.\n>> INTERESTING DAY. DOW DOWN 260 POINTS.\nAND WE'VE HEARD FROM SOME OF THE WORLD'S BEST INVESTORS AND\nBRIGHTEST INVESTORS TODAY WHO SAY THAT TIMES ARE DANGEROUS.\nPAUL SINGER, WHO YOU LISTENED TO BACK IN YOUR OFFICE, SAID THAT\nIT WAS A DANGEROUS TIME. RAY DAHL OWARNED IF THE FED\nRAISES INTEREST RATES, YOU COULD HAVE ASYMMETRIC RISKS.\nARE YOU STILL AS NEGATIVE TODAY AS YOU HAVE BEEN FOR THE BETTER\nPART OF THE LAST YEAR? >> YEAH.\nI MEAN, I DON'T KNOW IF NEGATIVE IS THE RIGHT WORD, EXACTLY.\nBUT I THINK THERE ARE TREMENDOUS RISKS.\nAND -- BUT I THINK ANYONE THAT IS GOING TO TELL YOU IT'S GOING\nTO GO DOWN TOMORROW, NEXT WEEK, EVEN NEXT MONTH OR NEXT YEAR,\nIT'S SORT OF GUESSING GAME. BUT YOU COULD LOOK AT THE\nENVIRONMENT AND I THINK IT'S VERY DANGEROUS.\nIN OTHER WORDS, YOU ARE WALKING ON A LEDGE, AND YOU MIGHT MAKE\nIT TO THE END. BUT, HEY, YOU FALL OFF THAT\nLEDGE, YOU'RE GOING TO REALLY SEE TROUBLE.\nAND I THINK THAT COULD WELL BE. >> WHAT PUSHES YOU OFF THE\nLEDGE? IS IT THE FED RAISING INTEREST\nRATES? YOU THINK THEY SHOULD?\nJAMIE DIMON YESTERDAY SAID THEY SHOULD.\nTODAY RAY DAHL OSAID THEY SHOULDN'T.\nWHAT DOES CARL ICAHN SAY? >> I REALLY WILL TELL YOU I\nDON'T THINK IT MATTERS. BECAUSE EITHER WAY, THERE'S A\nPROBLEM. IF YOU DON'T RAISE INTEREST\nRATES, I THINK WE'RE IN A MAJOR BUBBLE.\nYOU CAN'T -- I THINK CIGNA SAID IT RIGHT.\nI HEARD HIM FOR A WHILE. AND HE IS A VERY SMART GUY.\nI'VE KNOWN HIM FOR YEARS. I THINK HE'S SMART, DESPITE THE\nFACT THAT HE'S NOT FOR TRUMP. I THINK HE'S SMART.\nSO, YEAH. HE TOLD ME THAT.\nYOU KNOW. NO UNCERTAIN TERMS.\nI JUST SAW HIM -- I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM FOR A FEW MONTHS.\nHE TAKES IT REALLY SERIOUSLY. AND HE SAYS ME SOMEWHERE, AND HE\nLOOKS AT ME, \"CARL -- SORT OF COMPLIMENTARY.\nHE SAID, YOU'RE A SMART GUY, YOU'RE A SUPER SMART GUY.\nAND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE'S GOT THIS RAGE.\nHOW CAN YOU BE FOR TRUMP! AND FIRST I WAS LAUGHING.\nAND THEN I SAID, RELAX, RELAX, PAUL.\nAND HE REALLY -- BUT HE'S A VERY -- HE IS A VERY SMART GUY.\nAND HE'S ONE OF THE FEW GUYS I REALLY RESPECT ON WALL STREET.\nAND I THOUGHT -- I LISTENED TO HIM TODAY, AND I HONESTLY -- A\nLOT OF THE THINGS HE SAID I COULDN'T HAVE SAID IT BETTER\nMYSELF. AND THAT'S SAYING A LOT.\nHE -- HE WAS RIGHT ON. YOU KNOW WHAT HE WAS REALLY ON\nAND -- WE GET INTO THESE REGULATORY AGENCIES.\nAND THERE ARE GOOD REGULATORY AGENCIES THAT DO GOOD JOBS, GOOD\nREGULATORS. BUT THERE ARE SO MANY THAT --\nHIS WORDS WERE RIGHT ON. AMAZINGLY ARREST FWANT WHEN YOU\nTALK TO THEM. AND --\n>> YOU'VE TAKEN ON THE EPA. >> IT'S NOT EVEN TAKING ON.\nA WOMAN IN THE EPA, LOOK, I'M TOO OLD NOT TO BE POLITICALLY\nCORRECT. THIS WOMAN, JANET McCABE.\nAND YOU KNOW, SHE'S NUMBER TWO SOMETHING OR OTHER.\nAND SHE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MOST IDIOTIC -- AND, LOOK, I\nHAVE AN AGENDA HERE. BUT THE REASON I'M BRINGING IT\nUP IS IT FITS INTO WHAT IT IS WRONG WITH OUR ECONOMY.\nPEOPLE LIKE HER. AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY.\nNO, SERIOUSLY. AND EVERYBODY IS AFRAID TO SAY\nANYTHING ABOUT. OH, DON'T SAY ANYTHING, THERE\nWILL BE REPRISAL. I'M TOO OLD FOR THAT.\nLET THEM DO REPRISAL. WE OWN A REFINERY.\nREFINERIES, A COUPLE OF THEM. AND HERE'S WHAT THEY DO.\nAND HERE'S HOW IRRATIONAL IT IS. AND SHE'S RUNNING THIS PROGRAM.\nAND GET THIS. IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE.\nIT'S LIKE OUT OF \"ALICE IN WONDERLAND.\"\nTHEY HAVE THIS PROGRAM WHERE -- I'M NOT AGAINST THE RFS, AND I'M\nNOT -- I'M CERTAINLY NOT AGAINST ETHANOL OR FOR ETHANOL OR CLEAN\nAIR. I LIKE CLEAN AIR, I THINK IT'S\nGREAT. BUT THE WHOLE POINT OF WHAT I'M\nSAYING IS, THAT A FEW YEARS AGO, THEY PASSED THE CLEAN AIR ACT,\nAND RENEWABLE FUEL STANDARDS. AND THAT'S FINE.\nAND THEN THEY COME TO THE -- THEY COME TO THIS POINT, THEY GO\nTO THE EPA AND SAY, IN ALL YOUR WISDOM.\nAND I WILL SAY THIS. I MEAN, JANET McCABE, I'M\nCERTAIN SHE IS A SMART WOMAN AND NICE WOMAN.\nNEVER RUN A BUSINESS, NO BUSINESS BACKGROUND.\nAND THEY SAY, YOU OR WHOEVER DID THIS, YOU ARE GOING TO POLICE\nTHE FACT THAT IN THE CLEAN AIR ACT -- I'M GOING TO MAKE IT\nSIMPLE, BECAUSE I KNOW SCOTT IS GOING TO PUSH ME OFF IN A\nMINUTE, BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS MUCH.\nBUT,", "start": 487000.0, "length": 1313000.0, "channel": "355"}, {"end": 767782, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1473799514182.68fe39a6-f743-4125-a42b-ba6684d4e2ce.mp4#t=714.50,767.00", "text": ">>> COMING UP, TWO OF THE\nHEAVIEST HITTERS ARE STILL TO COME.\nBLACK STONE CEO WILL TELL US WHETHER HE THINKS THE FED SHOULD\nRAISE RATES AND HOW THAT COULD IMPACT THE MARKET AND THE\nECONOMY.

WELCOME, GUYS.\nFOR MORE ON TODAY'S MARKET ACTION THERE IS SO MUCH TO GET\nHERE. WHAT DO YOU THINK IN A NUT SHELL\nHAS HAPPENED? >> CONTINUING FROM FRIDAY IS\nTHIS BACK UP IN BOND YIELDS WE HAVE HAD GLOBALLY.\nIT IS GIVING A LITTLE BIT OF A SHOCK TO THE PREMISE OF A LOT OF\nSTOCK OWNERSHIP. LOWER FOR LONGER WITH RATES.\nIT ALLOWS YOU TO PAY MORE. IT ALLOWS YOU TO JUSTIFY HIGHER\nVALUEUATIONS. THAT IS THE IMMEDIATE OVERLAY OF\nWHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING HERE. ONCE YOU HAVE THAT BUYER STRIKE\nI DON'T THINK IT IS MOSTLY ABOUT THE FED.\nTHE FED IS LOOKING TOWARDS DECEMBER.\nIT IS JUST ABOUT WHY OUR BOND INVESTORS ARE GETTING COLD FEET.\nWE HAVE NOT MADE NET PROGRESS SINCE JULY 8.\nDOESN'T MEAN IT IS THE WHOLE STORY.\nTHAT IS WHAT I THINK UPSET THE STOCK SIDE.\n>> ANOTHER FASCINATING DEVELOPMENT THAT MAYBE PLAYS\nINTO THIS, MAYBE IT DOESN'T. WE FOUND OUT IN 2015 THAT\nHOUSEHOLD MEDIAN INCOME DROPPED 5%.\nMEDIAN IS A LITTLE BIT LOWER. POINT BEING YOU HAVE ACTUALLY\nVERY GOOD NEWS ABOUT WAGES. MAYBE IT'S ENOUGH TO KEEP GOING.\nMAYBE IT IS JUST ENOUGH FOR PEOPLE TO THINK THE BOND MARKETS\nARE MISPRICED. >> IT IS A LITTLE BIT BACKWARD\nLOOKING. IT TELLS YOU IT IS NOT JUST THAT\nWAGES ARE UP. THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD THINGS.\nIT WIPLAY INTO THE CAMPAIGN. YOU HAVE TO ASSUME MAYBE AMERICA\nISN'T AS BAD AS MR. TRUMP SAYS IT IS.\nIT WILL HELP CLINTON. GOING BACK TO TODAY'S MARKET\nTHERE IS NOTHING, NO SINGLE THING YOU CAN SAY THAT IS WHAT\nFREAKED US OUT. IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN HANG IT ON\nNORTH KOREA BLOWING SOMETHING UP.\nIF ANYTHING YOU CAN PROBABLY SAY IT IS BECAUSE YOU HAD THESE\nAMAZING PEOPLE AT YOUR PANEL TODAY.\nI WAS WATCHING SO MANY OF THESE BILLIONAIRE INVESTORS KIND OF\nREALLY WORRIED MORE THAN THEY WERE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT WHAT IS\nGOING ON. I DON'T KNOW -- I DON'T KNOW\nTHAT PLAYED INTO IT. >> WE CAN SHOW A CHART OF THE\nTEN YEAR, GUY. CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT YOU THINK.\nIT IS ONE THING TO KNOW THERE ARE THESE BEARS OUT THERE.\nANOTHER THING TO HEAR PAUL SINGER MAKE A CASE FOR WHY THE\nPARADIGM MIGHT BE SHIFTING HERE. >> I HAVE BEEN, AS YOU KNOW, I\nHAVE BEEN A STEADFAST BOND BULL FOR QUITE SOME TIME.\nYOU CAN'T BE DOGMATIC IN VIEWS. IF THE MARKET STARTS TO TELL YOU\nSOMETHING HAS CHANGED YOU SORT OF HAVE TO LISTEN TO IT.\nLAST WEEK WE FOUND OUT MAYBE THE ECB DOESN'T HAVE THE MARKETS\nBACK. I THINK PEOPLE SORT OF PUSH PAST\nTHAT. SOMEBODY LIKE JAMIE DIMON SAYING\nTHE FED WILL LOSE -- UNDERSTANDING THAT HE HAS A\nVESTED INTEREST FOR HIS COMPANY HE SAID HE THOUGHT THE FED WOULD\nLOSE CREDIBILITY IF THEY DIDN'T RAISE RATES.\nNOW YOU HAVE THE VOICES TODAY TALKING ABOUT MISSTEPS IN THE\nFED AND ALL THINGS THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT.\nI THINK THAT IS WHAT LEADS YOU DOWN THIS PATH.\nI THINK TO MIKE'S POINT I DON'T THINK IT IS NECESSARILY A U.S.\nBOND MOVE. I THINK IT IS MORE PREDICATED ON\nWHAT IS GOING ON OVERSEAS. IT WILL DRAG U.S. RATES HIGHER,\nAS WELL. IN TERMS OF BROADER MARKET THIS\nIS JUST SORT OF THE -- THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IN THE WAKE OF WHAT\nWE ARE SEEING. THAT BOND MOVEMENT FROM THE LOWS\nWE SAW 135 TO NUMBERS WE ARE SEEING NOW PERCENTAGE WISE IS A\nPRETTY STAGGERING MOVE. >> SO THE QUESTION IS WHEN IT\nCOMES TO BRING US BACK TO THE STOCK MARKET WHICH IS SELLING DO\nYOU BUY THE DIPS WHICH HAS BEEN THE RIGHT STRATEGY TO THIS\nPOINT? PEOPLE BLINK AND MISS THE SELL\nOFFS AND THEN WE CONTINUE TO RECOVER AND MOVE HIGHER.\nDO YOU DO THAT AGAIN OR SIT OUT AND THINK THIS TIME SOMETHING IS\nDIFFERENT. >> I'M NOT BREAKING ANY NEWS\nHERE. THE ENTIRE WAY UP I HAVE BEEN\nSKEPTICAL AND ALL ALONG I HAVE SAID MY SKEPTMISM.\nEVERY PULL OFF WE HAVE SEEN IN THE LAST SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS\nHAS BEEN A BUYING OPPORTUNITY. IS THIS GOING TO BE THE\nDIFFERENT ONE? I WISH I WAS SMART ENOUGH TO\nANSWER THAT QUESTION. I WILL SAY THE LONGER THE MARKET\nSTAYS BELOW THE 2,135 LEVEL IN THE S&P THE MORE CAUTIOUS I\nBECOME. I THINK A HUGE LEVEL WILL FIND\nITSELF AT 2050. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR CRITICAL\nSUPPORT THAT IS WHERE IT COMES. IF YOU CONTINUE TO SEE THESE\nPRETTY AMAZING MOVES IN BOND MARKETS GLOBALLY AGAIN THAT\nUNCERTAINTY DOESN'T LEND ITSELF TO A STABLE STOCK MARKET IN MY\nOPINION. >> IT WAS INTERESTING THIS\nHAPPENED ON A DAY -- THIS IS MUCH-ANTICIPATED EVENT OF THE\nWEEKEND. SHE WAS DOVISH WHICH IS CONTRARY\nTO WHAT WAS BUILT UP TO BE. SHE COMES OUT AND INSTEAD HAS A\nVERY DOVISH MESSAGE. IS THAT LOST?\nDO PEOPLE NOT CARE? DOES IT NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO\nWITH WHY BONDS ARE SELLING -- >> I THINK IT WAS A FACTOR\nYESTERDAY TO THE REBOUND. I THINK TODAY WE WOKE UP TO THE\nWALL STREET SAYING YOU HAVE A CONFLICTED FED NOT LIKELY TO\nMOVE IN SEPTEMBER. IF I'M JUST TRYING TO PUT THE\nMARKET ON THE COUCH A LITTLE BIT IT DEFINITELY FEEDS INTO THE\nIDEA THAT HAS BEEN BUILDING UP THAT CENTRAL BANKS ARE FATIGUED.\nTHEY DON'T THINK THE MARGINAL ADVANTAGE OF DOING ANYTHING MORE\nTHAN THEY HAVE DONE IS REALLY THERE.\nSO THAT IS TO ME WHERE IT FITS IN.\nNOT SO MUCH RATES ARE GOING UP ON US BUT WE JUST DON'T KNOW.\nI THINK STOCKS NEED A NEW STORY IF THEY ARE GOING TO GO HIGHER.\nIT IS NOT JUST ABOUT LOWER FOR LONGER.\n>> GOOD PLACE TO SWITCH GEARS. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.\n>> LATER. >> THERE IS MUCH MORE COMING UP\nAT FAST. CARL ICAHN WILL BE TALKING\nEVERYTHING FROM THE ECONOMY TO FED AND MARKETS.\nTHAT WILL BE HAPPENING WITHIN THE NEXT HOUR.\nBILL MILLER SPOKE EARLIER TODAY SHARING HIS BEST IDEA FOR THE\nMARKET. HE SAID HE IS LONG THE S&P AND\nSHORT TEN YEAR. WITH US TO EXPLAIN WHY IS BILL\nMILLER, CHAIRMAN AND CIO OF LMN, LLC.\nWELCOME. ASSUMING YOU HEARD SOME\nCONVERSATION WE WERE HAVING EXPLAIN THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE\nFED AND HAVING CONFIDENCE IN THE FED OR ANTICIPATING THEIR NEXT\nMOVES FITS IN WITH YOUR BEST IDEA HERE TO GO LONG STOCKS AND\nSHORT BONDS. >> BEING SHORT BONDS HAS BEEN A\nTERRIBLE TRADE FOR THE LAST 35 YEARS.\nI THINK THAT RIGHT NOW IT'S PROBABLY A GOOD TIME TO PUT THAT\nTRADE ON. AND THE REASON I SAY THAT IS\nTHAT YOU ARE IN A PERIOD NOW WHERE INTEREST RATES ARE ABOUT\nAS LOW AS THEY ARE GOING TO GO. WE HAVE SEEN A BACK UP IN GLOBAL\nYIELDS. MAYBE MOST IMPORTANTLY WE HAD AN\nINTERESTING THING TODAY HAPPEN WHICH IS FOR MOST OF THIS YEAR\nWHENEVER STOCKS SOLD OFF BONDS HAVE RALLIED.\nWE HAVE SEEN STOCKS SELLING OFF AND BONDS SELLING OFF.\n>> AND SO PAUL SINGER'S POINT WAS IF BOTH STOCK AND BOND\nPRICES ROSE TOGETHER DURING RECOVERY NOW THEY CAN BOTH FOLD\nTOGETHER. THAT MIGHT BE WHAT WE ARE\nSEEING. YOUR POINT OF VIEW YOU ARE\nSAYING BOND PRICES WILL FALL BUT YOU KEEP BUYING STOCKS.\n>> I THINK OVERALL VALUATIONS WHILE HIGH COMPARED TO HISTORIC\nNORMS THOSE NORMS WERE PERIODS WHERE AVERAGE BOND YIELD IS\nABOUT 6%. AVERAGE BOND YIELD IS 1.7% AND\nHAVE DIVIDEND GROWTH RATE AND WE CAN FIND REALLY GOOD VALUE IN\nTHE MARKET SHORT TERM CORRECTIONS IN THE MARKET REALLY\nI THINK ARE NOT TO BE TOO CONCERNED ABOUT.\n>> WHY IS THAT? MAKE THE CASE FOR SOMEBODY WHO\nHAS BEEN LISTENING TO THE TALK OF DELIVERING ALPHA OR\nCONTEMPLATING THIS MOVE WITH THE BOND MARKET AND SAYING IF YIELDS\nARE GOING HIGHER THAN STOCK PRICES MUST HAVE TO FALL LOWER\nAND MAYBE BE RE-VALUED. WHY DO YOU WANT TO BE LONG\nSTOCKS IN THIS ENVIRONMENT? >> I THINK IT IS A VALUATION\nCALL. IF YOU GO BACK 30 YEARS TO 1987\nSO SEPTEMBER 1987 THE MONTH BEFORE THE MARKET CRASHED YOU\nHAVE THE EXACT OPPOSITE SITUATION WHERE YIELDS HAVE BEEN\nRISING BUT STOCKS WERE CONTINUING TO RISE AND THE FED\nHAD BEEN TIGHTENING. THE 30-YEAR TREASURY YOU GOT TO\n10% IN OCTOBER OF '87. AND YET WHAT YOU HAD WAS STOCK\nMARKET GOES AROUND 18 TIMES EARNINGS AND WITH 3% YIELD.\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT STOCKS VERSUS BONDS IT MADE NO SENSE BECAUSE\nYOU HAVE 3% IN STOCKS AND DIVIDEND YIELD AND 5% GROWTH\nRATE WHICH MEANT YOU CAN ONLY MAKE 8% IN STOCKS WHERE TREASURY\nGAVE YOU 9% FOR 30 YEARS. SO THE VALUATION CASE WAS\nCOMPELLING. RIGHT NOW IT IS THE EXACT\nOPPOSITE WHICH IS IT IS HARD TO SEE.\nI THINK THE BOND MARKET MADE A DOUBLE TOP ONE IN 2012 AND THE\nOTHER JULY OF THIS YEAR. BONDS AROUND 135 LEVEL WITH BOND\nYIELDS THE LOWEST IN HISTORY AND STOCK VALUATIONS ARE CERTAINLY\nNOT DEMANDING COMPARED TO BONDS. IT IS VERY EASY TO SEE HOW A\nDECENT -- LONG TERM IT IS HARD TO SEE HOW IF YOU THREW A DART\nAND JUST CONTINUE TO HOLD IT YOU WILL GET 4% OR 5% GROWTH RATE IN\nDIVIDENDS.

WE EXPECT THIS TO BE A TIGHT\nRACE. YOU DON'T RUN A BIG CAMPAIGN\nBECAUSE YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A BLOWOUT.\nI EXPECT THAT. FOR FOLKS LOOKING AT THE NEWS\nTHIS MORNING, \"NEWS WEEK\" HAS COME OUT WITH AN EYE OPENING\nPIECE ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S ENORMOUS BUSINESS CONNECTIONS\nAROUND THE WORLD. THAT THE ARTICLE SAYS WOULD MAKE\nHIM A TREMENDOUS THREAT TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY.\nWE'VE HEARD ALREADY ABOUT HIS DEEP CONNECTIONS TO RUSSIA, DEEP\nFINANCIAL CONNECTIONS. HOW HIS COMPANIES ARE INDEBTED\nTO THE BANK OF CHINA, TO RUSSIAN OLIGARCHS.\nWE SAW THE PRAISE HE HEAPED ON VLADIMIR PUTIN AT THAT NATIONAL\nSECURITY FORUM. AND THEN LOOK WE'RE TALKING\nABOUT HEALTH RECORDS. DONALD TRUMP HASN'T RELEASED A\nSERIOUS HEALTH RECORD. THAT LETTER THAT THAT DOCTOR\nWROTE EVERYONE REGARDS AS A JOKE.\nHE HAS NOT RELEASED HIS TAXES. THE MEDIA REALLY HELD MITT\nROMNEY ACCOUNTABLE FOR NOT RELEASING HIS TAXES IN THE LAST\nPRESIDENTIAL RACE. I KNOW THAT YOU ALL HAVE BEEN\nTRYING TO HOLD TRUMP TO THAT SAME STANDARD.\nWE NEED TO SEE THOSE TAXES. WE NEED TO SEE --\n>> DOES THIS -- I'M SORRY. GO AHEAD.\nFINISH YOUR THOUGHT. >> NO, I WAS GOING TO SAY THAT\nWE NEED TO SEE THESE DEBTS THAT HE HAS.\nWE NEED TO SEE WHERE HIS EARNINGS ARE COMING FROM.\nWE NEED TO KNOW HOW MUCH HE'S PAYING IN TAXES.\nWE HAVE NONE OF THIS INFORMATION.\nAND EVERY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE FOR DECADES HAS RELEASED THIS\nINFORMATION. BOTH THE TAXES AND THE HEALTH\nINFORMATION. AND WE'VE SEEN NOTHING.\nSO I THINK DONALD TRUMP IS FACING A LOT OF CRITICISM RIGHT\nNOW FOR THAT. >> THESE ARE ALL VALID\nQUESTIONS, BUT BASED ON WHAT YOU JUST SAID, I WONDER IF YOU SEE\nTHIS PLAYING OUT AS A BATTLE BETWEEN WHICH CANDIDATE HAS\nBIGGER PROBLEMS AND NOT NECESSARILY A CAMPAIGN THAT\nFOCUSES ON ISSUES. THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING\nFROM BUSINESS LEADERS IS THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TALK ABOUT THE\nSUBSTANTIAL ISSUES ON EITHER SIDE.\n>> I COULD NOT AGREE MORE. BUT LET'S BE FAIR.\nWE'RE TALKING ABOUT PROBLEMS. DONALD TRUMP HAS NOT RELEASED A\nSERIOUS HEALTH ASSESSMENT. HILLARY CLINTON HAS.\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS RELEASED 40 YEARS OF TAXES.\nDONALD TRUMP HASN'T. HILLARY CLINTON HAS PUT OUT\nREAMS OF DETAILED POLICIES. SHE WOULD LOVE TO TALK ABOUT\nTHOSE ALL DAY LONG. DONALD TRUMP, HE JUST RELEASED A\nSO-CALLED PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROPOSAL YESTERDAY.\nVERY FEW DETAILS. IT'S TOTALLY UNCLEAR HOW IT\nWOULD WORK. HE SORT OF SHOVES IT INTO THE\nUNEMPLOYMENT SYSTEM WHICH WOULD BE A DISASTER.\nSO WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION.\n>> ROBBY, I WANTED TO ASK YOU A POLICY QUESTION REALLY AROUND\nTHE KIND OF PEOPLE THAT HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO SURROUND\nHERSELF WITH.

I CAN CHANGE MY MIND.\nBUT I WOULD TELL YOU THIS. THAT I ALSO LOOKED, BECAUSE I'M\nA MARKET SPECIALIST, AS I TOLD JANET McCABE'S SECRETARY, AND I\nTHINK I KNOW MARKETS.

IN THIS QUOTE SHE SAID DURING\nTHE ACTION WHICH IS A TIME IN WHICH THEY OVERTHREW GADDAFI.\nTHAT'S WHEN THE ACTION BEGAN AND ENDED.\nYES WE LOST FOUR INDIVIDUALS THERE.\n>> MY POINT IS SHE WENT INTO THE ACTION WITHOUT PROVIDINGED A\nKWALT GROUND TROOPS TO MAINTAIN THE STABILITY AND THEN THING\nSPUN OUT OF CONTROL AND FOUR AMERICANS DIED.\nFOUR AMERICANS ARE DEAD. >> SHE'S A MEMBER OF THE\nNATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL. >> SHE CONTROLLED SECURITY AT\nTHE CONSULATE. >> SHE DOES NOT CONTROL THE\nMARINES THAT ARE STATIONED AT THE CONSULATE.\nTHOSE ARE CONTROLLED BY THE MARINES.\n>> SHE CONTROLLED THE SECURITY SITUATION AT THE CONSULATE,\nRICHARD, SHE DID.

ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT YOU SEE HIS\nHEAD LIGHTS ARE SHINING DIRECTLY ON THREE PHOENIX POLICE OFFICERS\nINCLUDING A ROOKIE ON HIS FIRST DAY.\nTHE OFFICERS ARE IN UNIFORM STANDING HERE A PATROL CAR IN A\nWELL-LIT AREA. THEN YOU CAN SEE THE MAN IN THE\nNISSAN BACKS HIS CAR INTO A PARKING SPOT AND THEN TURNS OFF\nTHE LIGHTS. SEVERAL MINUTES GO BY BEFORE THE\nSUSPECT PULLS OUT OF THE PARKING SPOT, TURNS ON HIS LIGHTS, GOES\nAROUND THE GAS PUMP AND WATCH THIS, GOES DIRECTLY AT THE\nPOLICE OFFICERS. THE ROOKIE OFFICER WAS THROWN UP\nINTO THE AIR. YOU SEE HIM GO INTO THE STORE\nWINDOW. ANOTHER SUFFERED A BROKEN LEG,\nTHE THIRD OFFICER JUMPED OUT OF THE WAY.\nTHE SUSPECT THEN TRIES TO FIGHT THE OFFICERS BUT AMAZINGLY THE\nROOKIE AND THE SERGEANT WHO JUMPED OUT OF THE WAY WERE ABLE\nTO GET UP, TASE AND SUP DUE THE MAN AND THE CHIEF SAYS THEY WERE\nCLEARLY TARGETED. LISTEN.\n>> IT'S UNACCEPTABLE. I'VE BEEN IN LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR\nOVER 30 YEARS AND I'VE SEEN A LOT OF THINGS.\nBUT I HAVE NEVER SEEN SO MANY SENSELESS VIOLENT ACTS TARGETING\nLAW ENFORCEMENT. >> AND TONIGHT THE KELLY FILE\nHAS CONFIRMED THE SUSPECT WAS CONVICTED OF THREE COUNTS OF\nAGGRAVATED ASSAULT BACK IN 1997 AND IS NOW FACING THREE COUNTS\nOF ATTEMPTED MURDER AND WE ARE INVESTIGATING HIS CONNECTION TO\nOTHER GROUPS.

BUT INSTEAD OF MENTIONING THE\nCONTROVERSIAL COMMENTS, THE PRESIDENT INSTEAD OPTED TO\nDIRECT HIS FOCUS ELSEWHERE. WATCH.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT MR. TRUMP. HE'S NOT REALLY A PLANS GUY, A\nFACT GUY. THIS GUY WHO SPENT 70 YEARS ON\nTHIS EARTH SHOWING NO CONCERN FOR WORKING PEOPLE.\nTHIS GUY IS SUDDENLY GOING TO BE YOUR CHAMPION?\nHE'S NOT OFFERING ANY REAL POLICIES OR PLANS, JUST OFFERING\nDIVISION AND OFFERING FEAR. AND HE'S BETTING THAT IF HE\nSCARES ENOUGH PEOPLE HE MIGHT JUST SCARE UP ENOUGH VOTES TO\nWIN THIS ELECTION. >> JOINING ME NOW, KATRINA\nPEARSON TRUMP CAMPAIGN SPOKESMAN AND CHIEF ECONOMIST.\nGREAT TO SEE YOU BOTH. THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM BY THE\nPOLITICAL KNOW IT ALL IS THAT HE WILL BE VERY HELPFUL TO HILLARY\nBECAUSE PRESIDENT OBAMA NOW HAS A 58% APPROVAL RATING, HIGHEST\nSINCE HE'S HAD SINCE 2009, JULY 2009.\nWHAT SAY YOU? >> WELL, SURE, THAT IS THE\nCONVENTIONAL WISDOM. HOWEVER THIS IS NOT A\nCONVENTIONAL CAMPAIGN CYCLE. OBAMA IS CAMPAIGNING IN\nPENNSYLVANIA. THAT SHOULD TELL YOU EVERYTHING\nYOU NEED TO KNOW AS THE POLLS CONTINUE TO CLOSE ON HILLARY\nCLINTON.

THERE WERE SOME REPORTS\nYESTERDAY THEY'D COME IN THE NEXT 48 HOURS, BUT WE HAVE NOT\nHAD THAT CONFIRMED FROM THE CAMPAIGN ITSELF.\nALSO IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT HER CAMPAIGN HAS GONE ON A BIT\nOF A TWITTER RANT IN THE LAST HOUR IN ONE HOUR ALONE, THEY\nSENT OUT, UNDER HER TWITTER HANDLE, 20 TWEETS ATTACKS DONALD\nTRUMP. THESE WERE NOT SIGNED BY HILLARY\nCLINTON HERSELF, USUALLY SHE PUTS A DASH, H, IF IT'S FROM\nHERE. HERE ARE TWO EXAMPLES.\nIT'S CLEAR TRUMP SPENT HIS LIFE UNSCRUPULOUSLY LOOKING OUT FOR\nHIS OWN WALLET ABOVE ALL. WHY WOULD THAT CHANGE AS\nPRESIDENT? IN SOME, HOW WILL TRUMP\nGUARANTEE THAT IF FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN AMERICA'S\nSECURITY AND HIS OWN BANK ACCOUNT HE WON'T FEEL THE\nLATTER. THEY WANT TO GET HILLARY CLINTON\nBACK ON THE TRAIL TO CHANGE THE NARRATIVE.\nTRYING TO SHIFT THE FOCUS TO TRUMP'S BUSINESS PRACTICES, HIS\nFOREIGN POLICY POSITIONS, AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WITH\nSO-CALLED RUSSIAN MOB-BOSSES. BILL CLINTON STOOD IN FOR\nHILLARY CLINTON AT TWO HIGH PROFILE FUNDRAISERS IN LOS\nANGELES, WALKING AROUND, TALKING TO VOTERS AT A CAFE IN BEVERLY\nHILLS, BUT BATTLEGROUND POLLS HAVE DEMOCRATS WORRIED.\nTHE MOST INTERESTING POLL IS THE ONE FROM BLOOMBERG SHOWING TRUMP\nUP BY FIVE POINTS IN THE IMPORTANT BATTLEGROUND STATE OF\nOHIO. TRUMP LEADS CLINTON 44% TO 39%\nAMONG LIKELY OHIO VOTERS WHEN THIRD PARTY CANDIDATES JILL\nSTEIN AND GARY JOHNSON ARE INCLUDED.\nTHE POLL WAS CONDUCTED FROM FRIDAY UNTIL MONDAY WHEN CLINTON\nFACED CRITICISM FOR HER BASKET OF DEPLORABLES COMMENTS AND\nAFTER HER HEALTH SCARE ON SUNDAY.\nHER CAMPAIGN PUSHED BACK QUOTING A CBS BATTLEGROUND POLL THIS\nWEEK SHOWING HER UP BY SEVEN POINTS IN OHIO ANNOUNCING THAT\nTHEY HAVE OPENED HALF A DOZEN NEW OFFICES, CAMPAIGN OFFICES IN\nOHIO, BRINGING THEIR GROUND GAME TOTAL TO 54 OFFICES IN THE ALL\nIMPORTANT BUCKEYE STATE. DONALD TRUMP HAS ABOUT 15\nOFFICES IN OHIO. NEW POLL SHOWS TRUMP UP BY A\nSLIM TWO POINTS IN NEVADA. CLINTON WAS UP MY FOUR POINTS IN\nJULY. BILL CLINTON IS ABOUT TO SPEAK\nIN NEVADA.

WHAT WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT\nOVER THE NEXT SIX OR SEVEN DAYS IS WHETHER THE RUSSIANS ARE\nSERIOUS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WHAT THEY CONTROL AND, IN\nPARTICULAR, THE ACTIONS OF THE ASSAD REGIME ARE MOVING IN THE\nRIGHT DIRECTION. THAT IS THAT THE VIOLENCE COMES\nDOWN AND STOPS AND THAT ASSISTANCE GETS IN.\nTHAT IS BASED NOT ON TRUST BUT FACTS ON THE GROUND.\n>> WHAT IF YOU GIVE THEM INTEL AND END UP SHARING INTEL WITH AN\nORGANIZATION THAT ONLY DONALD TRUMP SEEMS TRUSTWORTHY AND\nWORTH WORKING WITH AT THIS POINT.\nTHE PENTAGON DOESN'T SEEM TO SHARE THAT OPINION.\n>> CHRIS, THE REASON THIS IS SO IMPORTANT, THERE ARE TWO THINGS\nWE CAN ACHIEVE. FIRST, IF THIS WORKS AND\nEMPHASIS ON THE IF, THEN PART OF THE DEAL IS TO TAKE THE SYRIAN\nAIR FORCE OUT OF THE SKIES OVER HEAVILY POPULATED CIVILIAN AREAS\nAND STOP THE BOMBING AND STOP THE CHLORINE WEAPONS, STOP THIS\nEGREGIOUS VIOLENCE AGAINST SYRIAN CIVILIANS.\nSECOND, IF IT WORKS, THEN WE'LL BE IN A POSITION TO GET RUSSIA\nMORE FOCUSED ON WHAT IT CLAIMS TO BE DOING IN SYRIA AND THAT IS\nALSO ISOL AND BASICALLY THE AL QAEDA AFFILIATE IN SYRIA.\nSO, IF WE CAN MOVE THINGS IN THAT DIRECTION, THAT IS A\nPROFOUNDLY POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT FOR THE PEOPLE OF SYRIA AND A\nPOSITIVE DEVELOPMENT FOR THE AL QAEDA AFFILIATE.\n>> RIGHT NOW YOU'RE SITTING IN BAGHDAD A PLACE YOU DO NOT GO TO\nLIGHTLY. WHAT IS THE CATALYST FOR YOU\nBEING ON THE GROUND THERE, THE URGENCY AND WHAT IS THE STATE OF\nPLAY THERE? >> BECAUSE WE'RE COMING TO A\nCRITICAL MOMENT IN THE FIGHT AGAINST ISAL.\nWHAT I'M SEEING HERE IS THEY'RE ON THE RUN AND ON THE ROPES.\nOVER THE LAST YEAR, THE IRAQIS WITH THE STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS\nCOALITION THAT WE'VE PUT TOGETHER HAS TAKEN BACK MORE\nTHAN HALF THE TERRITORY THAT THEY ONCE CONTROLLED.\nWE'VE TAKEN OUT SENIOR LEADERSHIP AND TENS OF THOUSANDS\nOF COMBATANTS AND EQUIPMENT, THE FINANCING IS DROPPING AND THE\nFOREIGN FIGHTERS ARE DROPPING. WE'RE AT A POINT NOW WHERE THE\nBIG REMAINING PIECE IS THE CITY OF MOSUL, WHICH IS WHERE THEY\nHAVE TRIED TO ESTABLISH ITS SO-CALLED CALIPHATE.\nTHAT IS THE NEXT FRONT AND THE IRAQIS ARE PREPARING TO LIBERATE\nMOSUL. GOING TO BE A DAUNTING\nOPERATION. BUT IT'S CRITICAL TO TAKING AWAY\nTHE ENTIRE FOUNDATION IN IRAQ. ALSO A BIG HUMANITARIAN PIECE\nBECAUSE AS THE CITIES LIBERATED, THERE IS A RISK THAT A LARGE\nNUMBER OF PEOPLE, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS ARE AT LEAST INITIALLY\nDISPLACED. WE'RE TRYING TO PUT IN PLACE THE\nRESOURCES TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE CARED FOR.\nWE'RE GOING TO BE ADDING ABOUT $181 MILLION TO THE HUMANITARIAN\nASSISTANCE WE'RE PROVIDING TO IRAQ TO HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE\nDISPLACED BY THE CONFLICT. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT\nTHEY'RE CARED FOR AND THEY CAN GO HOME AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.\nBY THE WAY, JUST IN THE ROUGHLY YEAR SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE,\nNEARLY 1 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RESEARTURN TO THEI\nHOMES IN IRAQ OF CITIES THAT. THE BIG NEXT PIECE IS MOSUL.\n>> I REMEMBER AN IRAQI GENERAL TELLING ME, DON'T COUNT THE\nDEAD. COUNT HOW MANY STORES ARE OPEN\nON THE STREETS, THAT'S WHAT MATTERS WINNING THE PEACE.\nTONY, YOU HAVE SHARED A SIMILAR MESSAGE.\nPLEASE, STAY SAFE THERE WITH YOUR TEAM AND LET US KNOW WHEN\nYOU HAVE INFORMATION THAT MATTERS TO THE AMERICAN\n>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME, CHRIS.
