SO I THINK THAT POLICY\nEXPERIMENT, IT HAS PROVED CHALLENGING.\nI'M NOT SURE I WOULD PROVE MONETARY POLICY IS OFF THE BACK\nOF THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS WE MAY WELL\nGET THIS WEEK FROM THE BANK OF JAPAN IS ANOTHER CUT IN TERMS OF\nINTEREST RATES FOR THE NEGATIVE TERRITORY.\nBUT AT THE SAME TIME, AND THIS IS WHAT IS INTERESTING FOR ME\nCOMING OUT OF THE CENTRAL BANK IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS, WE HAVE A\nCENTRAL BANK EXPLICITLY STATING SOMETHING DIFFERENT WHICH IS\nUNUSUAL. AND IT WILL GET ANCHORED FURTHER\nINTO NEGATIVE TERRITORY, BUT IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT\nTHEY DO TO HOLD UP THE LONG END. ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS OUT THERE\nIS THAT WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE COMMITMENT TO FISCAL\nSUPPORT. SO MAYBE NOT OFFICIAL\nRECOGNITION OF HELICOPTER MONEY AS SUCH BUT SOMETHING CLOSER TO\nTHAT.

YOU SAID EARLIER WE'RE SCRAPING\nTHE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL. WE ARE SCRAPING THE BOTTOM OF\nTHE JAM JAR, IF WE CAN GET ENOUGH JAM FOR A CRUMPET BUT NOT\nFOR A MEAL. >> THAT'S A GREAT BRITISH\nANALOGY THERE. >> WE ARE WORKING HARD TO KEEP\nTHE BRITISH THEME GOING THIS MORNING.\nBUT THE KEY THING FOR ME IS THE SENSE OF THE TEN-YEAR U.S.\nTREASURY YIELDS GOING TO BE HEADING UP TOWARDS 2% OR\nCERTAINLY BACK TOWARDS 1.5%. AND I THINK THAT ANYTHING THE\nFED RESERVE DOES, WHICH MAKES IT CLEAR THAT, YEAH, WE'RE STILL\nGOING HIGHER, YEAH, AS OF THE CENTRAL BANK RUNNING OUT OF\nAMMUNITION, WE THINK THE MARKETS SHOULD BE PRICING IN A MOVE IN\nDECEMBER. I THINK THAT KEEPS BOND MARKETS\nON THE BACK FOOT AND THAT IS WHERE THE DANGER IS FOR RISK\nSENTIMENT RIGHT ACROSS THE WORLD.\n>> IS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT THE FED JUST DOES IT, JUST RAISES\nRATES AND SAYS, YES, THERE IS A TREND WITH IT WEAKENING A BIT,\nBUT THEY ARE STILL POINTING TO A HEALTHY RECOVERY WITH INFLATION\nMOVING TO THE TARGET.

IN A SENSE, IT'S NOT -- IT'S NOT\nSO MUCH BURSTING A BUBBLE AT THIS POINT IN TIME, IT'S FATIGUE\nTHAT -- WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO OWN GOVERNMENT BONDS ANYWHERE\nWITH NEGATIVE YIELDS INSTEAD OF PUTTING YOUR MONEY IN CASH?\nWHAT CAN CENTRAL BANKS DO IF WE KNOW THEY WOULD LIKE STEEPER\nYIELD CURVES TO KEEP THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM VIABLE?\nTHOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS WE ASK AROUND.\nGENERALLY, WE SEE THAT THE SUPPORT FOR GLOBAL BOND MARKETS\nIS FADING A LITTLE BIT. IF WHAT WE DO, WE HAVE SEEN THE\nLOW IN TREASURY YIELDS AND THE TEN-YEAR YIELD IS, SOMEWHERE AT\nONE POINT, SOMEWHERE BELOW 2%. BIG DEAL.\nIT'S AN OVERSHOOT SPIKE SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE THAT THAT\nWOULD HAVE MUCH MORE COLLATERAL DAMAGE.\nBUT I DON'T SEE A BIG BEAR MARKET IN BONDS.\nI JUST THINK WE HAVE SEEN THE LOW IN YIELDS FOR QUITE A LONG\nTIME. >> WHAT ABOUT THE DOLLAR?\nWHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE DOLLAR, ARE YOU BUYING IT INTO THE FED\nMEETING WHETHER OR NOT THEY RAISE RATES SEPTEMBER, DECEMBER\nOR MAYBE EARLY NEXT YEAR? >> YEAH, I THINK THE DOLLAR,\nWHICH HAS BEEN LARGELY MOVING SIDEWALKS AGAINST THE EURO AND\nYEN FOR MONTHS NOW, WHICH HAS LOST GROUND OVER THE SUMMER, ALL\nTHOSE LAZY, THOSE COMFORTABLE EASY CARRY TRADES THAT WE SAW AS\nPEOPLE WERE HUNTING YIELD OVER THE SUMMER.\nI THINK WE CAN STILL UNWIND MORE OF THAT IF MARKETS ARE\nENCOURAGED TO PRICE IN A RATE HIKE DOWN THE ROAD WITH MORE\nCONVICTION. I THINK THOSE TRENDS CAN BE\nTAKEN OFF AS PEOPLE TAKE BETS OFF.\nA MUCH SHARPER DOLLAR MOVE SEEMS UNLIKELY AT THIS POINT, WE'RE\nNOT -- WE'RE FINE-TUNING A FED STORY AND WE'RE TRYING TO COPE\nWITH THE END OF THE CYCLE IN MONETARY POLICY OVER THE BANK OF\nJAPAN. >> KIT, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US\nTHIS MORNING.

FINALLY, FINALLY, YOU GET\nREWARDED FOR ADDING APPLE TO THE DOW.\nFINALLY -- WHEN DID YOU ADD IT? >> I KNEW I WAS GOING TO HEAR\nABOUT IT THIS MORNING. >> SOMETHING ELSE BROUGHT YOU\nHERE, BUT IT'S JUST FUNNY. GOING TO TAKE THE BIG VICTORY\nLAP BECAUSE IT FINALLY HAD THE -- WHEN DID YOU ADD IT?\n>> MARCH, AND IT WAS UP. >> LONG-TERM FORECASTING IS\nREALLY DIFFICULT, RIGHT. >> THE DOW WAS FLAT SINCE APPLE\nWAS ADDED AND SO IT'S NOT A HUGE ALBATROSS.\n>> THE FIRST TIME HAPPY THEY ADDED.\n>> THE REASON I CALL IT THE MISFIT STOCK, IT DOESN'T ACT\nLIKE A BELLWETHER. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN APPLE'S\nONE YEAR PERFORMANCE AND THE S&P PERFORMANCE, AND THE OTHER THING\nIS IT'S A CHEAP STOCK AS EVERYBODY REMINDS YOU AND YET IT\nHAS KIND OF A HIT DRIVEN BUSINESS AND BASICALLY OPERATES\nBY GROWTH COMPANY RULES. IT'S RARE TO SEE AN ENORMOUS\nCOMPANY THAT EVERY YEAR HAS TO WOW THE WORLD.\nI THINK THAT ACCOUNTS FOR A LOT OF THE DEPRESSURED VALUATION.\nAND THEN THE LEGION OF STEADY FANS OUT THERE IN THE WORLD, AND\nALSO UNDER OWNED, AND I THINK THAT'S BEHIND WHAT THE LATEST\nMOVE IS ABOUT. YOU HAD THEM SELL DOWN THE STOCK\nIN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR, AND THE TOP THREE HOLDERS OF\nRECORD ARE INDEX FUND MANAGERS AND IT SEEMS AS IF IT WAS THE\nPASSIVE HOLDER'S HANDS. YOU HAVE TO OWN SOME.\nTHAT'S WHY IT'S A BIT OF A MISFIT AND RUNS IN THE STREETS.\nIT HAS HAD 20 OR 30% MOVES ABOVE AND BELOW THE STARTING POINT.\n>> MIKE, STICK AROUND. WE WILL TALK MORE ABOUT THAT.\nBUT THE REASON DAVID IS HERE TODAY IS TALKING ABOUT A NEW\nSECTOR S&P IS ADDING TODAY. 28 REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS\nTHAT USED TO FALL UNDER FINANCIALS AND THEY WILL BECOME\nTHE NEW REAL ESTATE SECTOR. AND JOINING US TO TALK ABOUT\nTHAT MOVE IS DAVID BLITZER. DAVID, THIS IS UNUSUAL.\nTEN SECTORS WE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING FOR A LONG TIME AND\nYOU ARE ADDING AN 11th, AND WHY BREAK OUT REAL ESTATE?\n>> WELL, I THINK TWO OR THREE THINGS HAPPENED.\nREAL ESTATE USED TO BE TUCKED INTO FINANCIALS AND REAL ESTATE\nESPECIALLY READS DON'T BEHAVE THE SAME WAY FINANCIALS DO AT\nALL. BECAUSE THEY HAVE BETTER\nDIVIDENDS, ABOUT ONE-THIRD LARGER THAN FINANCIALS AND THE\nYIELD WILL GO DOWN ABOUT A QUARTER OF A POINT BECAUSE OF\nTHE CHANGE. SECOND OF ALL REAL ESTATE RATES\nHAVE BECOME MORE POPULAR OVER THE LAST 16 YEARS SINCE WE\nCREATED -- >> THE GLOBAL STANDARD.\n>> IT WAS CREATED TO USE WITH ALL OF THE MCI USES IT WITH\nTHEIRS SOERBGS WE CAN ANALYZE AND FOLLOW THE MARKET, AND WE\nCAN FIND OUT WHICH SECTOR IS NOT MOVING BECAUSE APPLE IS NOT IN\nIT AND ALL THOSE OTHER ISSUES. >> THERE'S A WARNING ABOUT NEW\nBUBBLES CREATED BY THE FED'S NEW RATE POLICY.\nIS THAT SOMETHING THAT COMES AS A RISK IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT\nTHIS AS A SECTOR, HOW BUBBLISHOUS DOES IT FEEL?\n>> ONE OF THE THING ONE CAN DO IS USE THE NEW SECTOR TO TRACK\nTHAT SECTOR OF THE MARKET AND SEE IF THEY ARE OUT OF LINE.\nHAD WE HAD A CLEAR TECHNOLOGY SECTOR BACK IN THE 1990s, WE\nPROBABLY WOULD HAVE SEEN IT GO TO THE MOON, AND WE WERE\nTRACKING THE PROPORTION OF TECH STOCKS AND WE KNEW WE WENT 15%\nTO 16% TO ONE-THIRD OF THE INDEX BY 2000.\n>> WOULD WE BE ABLE TO LOOK BACK AT HISTORICAL IF THERE HAD BEEN\nTHIS SECTOR IN PARTICULAR AND WE COULD SEE WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER\nTHE LAST TEN YEARS? >> NOT AT THIS POINT THERE'S NOT\nAN OFFICIAL REAL ESTATE SECTOR HISTORY, HOWEVER ONE GOES INTO\nGICS IN ONE LEVEL DETAIL, AND ONE CAN PULL OUT THE REAL ESTATE\nBY LOOKING AT THE EIGHT-DIGIT CODES AND TAKE A LOOK AT THAT.\nWHAT WE SEE IS THE FIRST READ IN THE 500 WAS OCTOBER OF 2001, AND\nTHEY HAVE GROWN VERY RAPIDLY SINCE THEN AND THEY MOVED UP\nBEFORE OCTOBER 2001, AND THERE WERE NO READS AND IT WAS\nPROBABLY DIFFICULT TO BUY REAL ESTATE IN THE EQUITY MARKETS 15\nOR 20 YEARS AGO. >> WHAT WILL AN INVESTOR OR FUND\nTHAT HAS BEEN TRACKING FINANCIALS NOTICE THAT IS\nDIFFERENT IN THEIR PORTFOLIO TODAY DIFFERENTLY?\n>> WELL, FIRST, THEY WILL LOOK AT THE NUMBERS AND THEY WILL SEE\nTHE PERCENTAGE OF FINANCIALS LOOKS SMALLER BY THREE POINTS\nBECAUSE WE PULLED OUT REAL ESTATE.\nSECOND, WHAT THEY MAY NOTICE IN A LOT OF ACTIVITY MANAGED FUNDS,\nLAST WEEK THEY PROBABLY THOUGHT THEY WERE WEIGHTED IN FINANCIALS\nAND THIS WEEK THEY MY FIND OUT THEY ARE UNDER WEIGHTED IN REAL\nESTATE, AND SOME OF THE STORIES WE HEARD IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS\nTHERE ARE A LOT OF ACTIVE FUNDS THAT WILL HAVE TO GO OUT AND BUY\nTO BOOST THEIR REAL ESTATE EXPOSURE, AND IF THAT'S A\nACCURATE CASE, WE WILL FIND OUT OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS.\n>> WHAT IS INTERESTING, DAVID, WHEN YOU SEPARATE THIS OUT YOU\nHAVE WHAT IS NOW THE FINANCIAL SECTOR A GOOD DEAL SMALLER THAN\nTHE COMBINATION OF REAL ESTATE, CONSUMER STAPLES, AND UTILITIES,\nWHICH ARE THE YIELD SECTORS, AND THAT SHOWS YOU THE INDEX AS A\nWHOLE IS KIND OF MORE PERHAPS SENSITIVE TO RISING RATES THAN A\nBENEFICIARY. >> WHAT JUMPED OUT AT YOU?\nWHAT ARE THINGS YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING?\n>> UP UNTIL ABOUT A WEEK AGO, WE HAD VICK SITTING THERE AT 13 OR\n14, AND IT LOOKED LIKE IT DIED AND NOTHING HAPPENED AND WE HAD\nEVERYBODY SORT OF LIKE, WHEN IS SOMETHING GOING TO HAPPEN KIND\nOF STUFF, AND THEN WE HAD VOLATILITY AND I THINK WE ARE IN\nFOR A LOT MORE VOLATILITY, AND THIS WEEK ALONE BETWEEN THE U.N.\nAND EVERYBODY MAKING NOISE AND THEN THE FED ON WEDNESDAY, AND\nEVEN WITHOUT THE UNFORTUNATE NEWS ABOUT THE BOMBING IN\nCHELSEA, AND THIS WEEK COULD BE AN EXCITING WEEK THAT WILL KEEP\nALL OF US BUSY, AND -- >> DO YOU THINK THE VOLATILITY\nIS RELATED TO THE ELECTION AT ALL?\n>> YES, I DO. I THINK IF YOU LOOK BACK AT\nELECTIONS, YOU GET PAST LABOR DAY AND THE RACE ALWAYS TIGHTENS\nUP, NO MATTER WHO WINS, AND IT'S NOT A RECOMMENDATION FOR EITHER\nCANDIDATE, THINGS ALWAYS TIGHTEN UP AND THERE'S A LOT OF NOISE\nAND NEWS MEDIA FOCUSES MORE BECAUSE FOR A LONG TIME IT HAS\nNOT BEEN EXCITING AND IT GETS EXCITING, SO THAT IS DRIVING IT.\nWITH THINGS LIKE THIS WEEKEND IN NEW YORK, THERE WILL BE A LOT\nMORE ATTENTION AS TO WHAT CANDIDATES SAY WHAT SHOULD BE\nDONE NOW AND WHO SCREAMS LOUD WUR.\n>> THANK YOU FOR COMING IN.", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1474288947387.1474284727569.1def4b0d-3317-4a0f-ad5c-4d482a989102.segment4.thumb.jpg", "channel": "355"}, {"start": 203811, "length": 21939.0, "end": 225750.0, "date": 1474286798188, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1474290177215.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1474286527177-b160bd88-8f36-43e0-8f3d-d16b47e2fbcc-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=203.81,225.75", "text": ">>> RIGHT NOW AS WE HEAD TO THE\nBREAK, LOOK AT THE U.S. EQUITY FUTURES.\nTHEY HAVE BEEN STRONGER ALL MORNING.\nWE SEE A BIG SURGE OF THE FUTURES, AND THE DOW UP ABOUT 92\nPOINTS.

HE'S BASICALLY SAYING, LISTEN,\nTHESE ARE ALL GOOD, BUT I RECOGNIZE, YES, FACEBOOK'S\nOPPORTUNITY TOTAL ADJUSTMENT FOR FACEBOOK IS NOT AS BIG AS FOR\nAMAZON, I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT.\nA LOT OF RETAILERS TRADING UP THERE.\n>> FACEBOOK WITH AN EMMY WIN LAST NIGHT AS WELL.\nSOMETHING NEW FOR THEM. MEANWHILE, DOW'S UP ABOUT 93\nPOINTS. BOB PISANI'S ON THE FLOOR.\nHEY, BOB. >> AND A NICE START TO THE WEEK,\nCARL. HAPPY MONDAY MORNING.\nDOW'S UP 90 AS YOU MENTIONED. EUROPE'S UP AS WELL AFTER A\nLOUSY WEEK LAST WEEK, AND FORGET ABOUT THAT ONE.\nWE'RE DOING ALL RIGHT OVER IN EUROPE.\nMOST OF THE BANKS ARE UP. SOME OF THE ITALIAN BANKS ARE\nUP, UNICREDIT, BANCO SANTANDER, DEUTSCHE BANK IS UP, TOTAL IS UP\nAND AUTOS WHICH WERE A BIG LEADING INDICATOR, LIKE DIAMLER,\nALSO ON THE UPSIDE. SECTORS HERE IN THE U.S. WITH\nOIL UP NICELY HERE ON MORE RUMORS ABOUT SOME SUPPLY\nCONSTRAINTS, PERHAPS. ENERGY IS UP.\nBANK STOCKS ARE DOING BETTER HERE.\nTECH, WHICH WAS THE BIG MARKET LEADER LAST WEEK, PARTICULARLY\nAPPLE. AND THERE IT IS THE S&P 500 REAL\nESTATE SECTORS, WE TALKED ABOUT ALL LAST WEEK, THERE IS NOW AN\nELEVENTH SECTOR. THIS IS THE FIRST MORNING IT\nSTARTED TRADING. YOU CAN SEE IT'S UP\nFRACTIONALLY. REITs GOT HIT LAST WEEK ON RATE\nCONCERNS, BUT OVERALL THEY'VE OUTPERFORMED THIS YEAR.\nREITs ARE UP ABOUT 6% OR 7%, OUTPERFORMING THE S&P BY ABOUT\nTWO PERCENTAGE POINTS. WE HAD LONG TERM INTEREST RATES\nSTAYING LOW. THAT HELPS REITs.\nWE HAD HIGH DIVIDENDS TYPICALLY PAYING 4%.\nAND THIS TALK ABOUT THIS NEW CREATION OF THIS NEW SECTOR HAS\nALSO DRIVEN SOME INTEREST AS WELL HERE.\nBEST PERFORMERS IN THE REITs, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I KNOW YOU'LL\nFIND THIS AMAZING, BUT RETAIL REITs HAVE DONE VERY WELL\nBECAUSE THE BIGGEST AND THE BEST GUYS OUT THERE, YOUR EQUITY\nONES, YOUR KIMCOS, SIMON PROPERTIES, THEY HAVE ACCESS TO\nTHE VERY BEST REAL ESTATE AND VERY BEST RETAIL PEOPLE OUT\nTHERE. SO THE TOP END MALLS ARE AMONG\nTHE BEST PERFORMERS. IT'S THE LOWER END MALLS, THE\nSTRIP MALLS HAVING TROUBLE. YOU'LL SEE A LOT OF THEM GET\nBULLDOZED OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS, I PREDICT, OVERALL.\nNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ASKING WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU OWN THE\nFINANCIALS IN THE S&P 500 BECAUSE THE REITs ARE GONE OUT?\nAND THE ANSWER IS THAT YOU GET A DISTRIBUTION.\nTHAT'S WHY YOU HAVE THE XLF, THEY'RE GOING TO BE DISTRIBUTING\nPARTS OF THE XLF, WHICH WERE REITs, SPINNING IT OFF OF COURSE\nINTO A SEPARATE SECTOR FOR HOLDERS OF THE ETF.\nTHAT'S WHY YOU'LL SEE THESE GYRATIONS IN THE S&P FINANCIAL\nSECTOR THIS WEEK BECAUSE OF THE DISTRIBUTION THAT'S GOING ON.\nWHEN IT'S ALL OVER, REITs WILL BE 3% OF THE S&P, ABOUT THE SAME\nAS MATERIAL STOCKS, ABOUT THE SAME AS TELECOM STOCKS.\nTALK MORE ABOUT THAT LATER. I JUST WANT TO SHOW YOU GM\nTHOUGH WHICH IS UP NICELY. GM HAS NOT HAD A GOOD YEAR\nOBVIOUSLY. AUTOS DOWN ABOUT 6% ON THE YEAR.\nI THOUGHT IT WAS A BOLD CALL BY THE ANALYSTS AT MORGAN STANLEY\nHERE WITH THEIR NUMBERS BECAUSE BY AND LARGE MOST OF THE\nESTIMATES FOR SEPTEMBER HAVE BEEN COMING DOWN.\nAND IF YOU TAKE A LOOK HERE WHAT'S GOING ON, ONLY SEVEN\nANALYST HAVES A BUY ON THIS RIGHT NOW.\nTEN HAVE A HOLD. AND NONE HAVE A SELL.\nYOU KNOW IT'S 70%, 80% BUY FOR MOST OF THE ANALYSTS ON ALL THE\nSTOCKS, THIS IS A PRETTY PESSIMISTIC GROUP IN GM.\nTHAT'S WHY I LOVE THE GUY FOR MAKING A BOLD CALL.\nAS FOR THE FED, THIS IS A TOUGH ONE BECAUSE THE ODDS SAY 15%,\n20%, AND YET WHY IS THE ANXIETY LEVEL SO HIGH DOWN HERE THAT THE\nFED MIGHT IN FACT TRY TO DO SOMETHING?\nA LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL THE FED REALLY DOES AND THEY'RE GOING TO\nTRY TO SURPRISE PEOPLE. SO THERE'S THIS SORT OF\nPARALYSIS MODE GOING ON. NOBODY BELIEVES THE 15% CHANCE\nAND THEY THINK THEY COULD GET SURPRISED IN OFF SIDES ON THE\nMARKET HERE. BEST BET AVERAGE PERSON DOWN\nHERE THINKS NO HIKE, BUT A LOT OF HAWKISH TALK AGAIN ABOUT\nDECEMBER, WHICH ALSO CREATES A LITTLE MORE ANXIETY.\nGUYS, I'VE NEVER SEEN IT SO ANXIOUS DOWN HERE ON A RATE HIKE\nTHAT NOBODY BELIEVES IS ACTUALLY GOING TO HAPPEN.\nIT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A STRANGE PSYCHOLOGICAL SITUATION TO BE\nIN.

THE SECRETARY GENRE MINDING\nEVERYBODY THAT THE ALGERIA MEETING IS INFORMAL.\nSO THE LOGICAL INFERENCE THERE IS NO DECISION IS REALLY\nEXPECTED. MEANTIME YOU HAVE THE\nVENEZUELANS OUT SAYING A DEAL COULD BE VERY CLOSE.\nSO YOU SEE THIS FRAGMENTATION GOING ON WITHIN THE CARTEL.\nTHEN OF COURSE SOME CHATTER IN THE MARKETPLACE ABOUT AN\nEMERGENCY MEETING, MAYBE SOMETHING MORE FORMAL AFTER\nALGERIA, TO FINALIZE SOME SORT OF A PLAN.\nSO A LOT OF UNKNOWNS WHEN IT COMES TO OPEC.\nMEANTIME, I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT RBOB GASOLINE THIS MORNING, IT'S\nTRADING DOWN DESPITE THE FACT CRUDE IS COMING UP.\nWE HAVE AN UPDATE ON THE COLONIAL PIPELINE IINCIDENT.\nTHE COMPANY IS WORKING ON A BYPASS TO HELP DELIVER SUPPLIES\nTO SOME OF THE STATES IN THE SOUTHEAST THAT SUFFERED THIS\nWEEKEND. AND THEY SAW GAS PRICES SPIKE AT\nTHE PUMP. SO THIS IS SOMETHING TO WATCH,\nBUT THE EXPECTATION IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME\nRESOLUTION BY THE END OF THE WEEK AND THAT THIS WAS A\nTEMPORARY BLIP.

YOU WILL SEE RESOURCES.\nYOU WILL SEE VANS, SPECIALIZED UNITS, BOMB DOGS, ROBOTS, THINGS\nLIKE THAT. IT'S NOT JUST THE NYPD.\nTHERE'S FEDERAL ASSETS THAT ARE BROUGHT TO BEAR DURING THIS\nWEEK. IF YOU ADD THE BOMB INCIDENT\nTHAT TOOK PLACE LAST NIGHT, YOU ARE GOING TO SEE EVEN MORE\nRESOURCES. CERTAINLY THE FEDS ARE GOING TO\nHAVE MORE RESOURCES BROUGHT, THE PD, THEY WILL HAVE THEIR\nCOUNTERTERRORISM UNITS OUT TO SHOW THAT DISPLAY OF FORCE.\nI THINK PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN NEW YORK WON'T BE SURPRISED.\nA LOT OF WHAT'S NOT SEEN IS ALL THE VIDEO AND SOME OF THE\nSPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT, THE CAMERAS AND THE LIKE.\nTHERE WILL BE A LOT OF RESOURCES BROUGHT TO BEAR ON THIS.\n>> BEYOND JUST WHETHER OR NOT THE MAYOR IS GOING TO BE\nCOMFORTABLE USING THE WORD TERRORISM, WHAT WAS IT YOU TOOK\nAWAY FROM THIS? I KNOW SOMETHING THAT I TOOK,\nTHE VIDEO, THE FACT THAT WE HAVE PROBABLY NOT SEEN -- THE PD HAS\nPROBABLY NOT SEEN ALL THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE TO THEM.\nOBVIOUSLY, THEY WERE VERY GUARDED.\nI'M SURE THERE'S A LOT MORE INFORMATION AND DIFFERENT\nINVESTIGATIVE THEORIES THAT ARE BEING RUN AGROUND AS WE SPEAK.\nNOBODY IN THAT PRESS CONFERENCE IS GOING TO GO ON AND DISCLOSE\nANY OF THAT INFORMATION, BECAUSE IT COULD JEOPARDIZE THE\nINVESTIGATION. CERTAINLY, THERE'S INFORMATION\nOUT THERE ONLINE THAT THEY MUST BE LOOKING AT.\nTHERE MAY BE EVEN PEOPLE THAT HAVE CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY BUT\nTHAT NEEDS TO BE VETTED. YOU CERTAINLY DON'T WANT OTHER\nCOPYCATS TO DO THAT AND THEN DISRUPT THE FLOW OF THE\nINVESTIGATION. >> I'M LOOKING AT THE TIME LINE.\nIT'S BEEN ABOUT 12 HOURS SINCE THE SECONDARY DEVICE WAS\nDISCOVERED ON 27th STREET, TWO HOURS LATER, IT WAS TAKEN AWAY\nFOR ANALYSIS. PUTTING THAT TOGETHER, IT'S BEEN\nTEN HOURS OR SO. ARE YOU SURPRISED THAT WE'RE NOT\nHEARING ANYTHING DEFINITIVE ABOUT WHETHER THAT WAS A LIVE\nBOMB, THAT PRESSURE COOKER, WHETHER IT WAS EMPTY?\nWE DON'T KNOW. >> WE DON'T KNOW.\nI'M NOT SURPRISED. IT'S IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF AN\nINVESTIGATION WITH MULTIPLE CRIME SCENES, WITH AN ACTUAL\nEXPLOSION, WITH AN UNEXPLODED DEVICE, IT'S STILL VERY EARLY\nON. KIND OF THE TIME LINE OF THESE\nTHINGS. THERE MAY BE SOME REALLY GOOD\nLEADS THAT THE NYPD AND THE FBI ARE EXPLORING RIGHT NOW, BUT\nTHEY DON'T WANT TO GO AND GIVE THAT TOO MUCH INFORMATION TO THE\nPUBLIC AT THIS POINT BECAUSE IT MIGHT JEOPARDIZE THE\nINVESTIGATION. WE JUST DON'T KNOW.\nEVERYBODY WANTS ANSWERS, BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE\nPATIENT. >> YOU MENTIONED THE PUBLIC.\nIT SEEMS TO BEAR REPEATING THAT IT REALLY -- A LOT OF THIS CAN\nFALL ON THE SHOULDERS OF THE PUBLIC, WHAT THEY HAVE SEEN,\nWHAT THEY KNOW. EVEN JUST A SENSE.\n>> ABSOLUTELY. WE SAW WHAT CROWD SOURCING DID\nFOR THE BOSTON MARATHON INVESTIGATION.\nIT WOULD BE GREAT IF THEY ARE ABLE TO RECOVER SOME VIDEO AND\nSOME PHOTOS. IF, IN FACT, THEY DON'T HAVE ANY\nGOOD LEADS AND GET THAT INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC, CROWD\nSOURCE THING. I'M SURE THAT'S A BIG COMPONENT\nOF WHAT THEY'RE DOING NOW. THE CHIEF TALKED ABOUT SOME OF\nTHESE CAMERAS AND THE CHIPS AND VARIOUS -- WHEREVER THESE IMAGES\nARE STORED MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE YET BECAUSE IF THEY ARE\nPROPRIETARY, THEY BELONG TO A STORE OWNER.\nWE WILL SEE. >> WHAT DO YOU THINK THE TIME\nFRAME IS FOR ACCESSING ALL OF THIS VIDEO, GETTING THE\nINVESTIGATORS TO LOOK THROUGH EVERYTHING AND FIGURE OUT IF\nTHEY SEE SOMETHING AS THAT ONE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER\nSUGGESTED, YOU HAVE TO LOOK BEFORE THE BOMBING.\n>> THEY WILL PUT A LOT OF RESOURCES ON THAT.\nIT WILL BE, I WOULD ASSUME, WITHIN THE NEXT 12 TO 24 HOURS\nTHEY WILL HAVE BASICALLY COMPILED EVERY BIT OF DIGITAL\nEVIDENCE POSSIBLE AND TRY TO PUT THAT TOGETHER AND IF THEY CAN\nGET SOMEBODY ARRIING AND AFTER AND -- JUST LIKE THEY DID FOR\nBOSTON AND LIKE THEY HAVECRIMES. YOU CAN'T WALK FIVE FEET WITHOUT\nBEING ON SOMEBODY'S CAMERA. IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME TO\nFIGURE OUT WHAT'S RELEVANT AND WHAT'S NOT.\n>> I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME TO OUR CONVERSATION, JIM CAVANAUGH.\nAS YOU JOIN ME HERE, LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR TAKEAWAY, THE BIGGEST\nTHING YOU TOOK AWAY FROM THE NEWS CONFERENCE.\n>> WELL, I THINK THEY ARE PROBABLY COMING OFF WE DON'T\nTHINK IT'S TERRORISM SHORTLY AND PROBABLY TODAY.\nLET'S LOOK AT FACTS HERE. AL QAEDA'S \"INSPIRE\" MAGAZINE,\nTHE FIRST EDITION, THEY HAD A PRE-EDITION AS WELL, THE FIRST\nEDITION ON PAGE 40 SPECIFICALLY SAYS, YOU MAKE PIPE BOMBS, YOU\nHAVE THREE PIPE BOMBS. THEY HAVE A PHOTOGRAPH.\nYOU EXTERNALLY WIRE THE PIPE BOMBS FOR AFFECT.\nI CAN TELL YOU IN 40 YEARS OF BOMB INVESTIGATION BASICALLY --\nI WAS A DEPUTY OF CHIEF OF EXPLOSIVES.\nI TRAINED A BOMB INVESTIGATORS. I KNEW VIRTUALLY EVERY BOMB IN\nTHE COUNTRY. WE RAN THE BOMB SYSTEMS.\nBOMBS THAT ARE EXTERNALLY FUSED WITH ELECTRIC WIRE, PIPE BOMBS\nLIKE THAT, HAPPEN SOMETIMES. BUT THEY ARE UNUSUAL EVENTS.TEL\nUNUSUALLY DIFFUSED BOMB IN SEASIDE PARK.\nTHE NEXT PARAGRAPH IN THE MAGAZINE SAYSEFFECTIVE\nWAY IS WITH A PRESSURE COOKER. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS --\nCOMMANDERS HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS FORMULA THAT'S LATE OUT IN\n\"INSPIRE\" MAGAZINE. WE HAVE THE BOMB THAT TARGETS\nTHE MARINE RUN. IT SORT OF MALFUNCTIONS.\nONE DEVICE GOES OFF. PROBABLY BLOWS THE OTHER TWO\nLOOSE. THE BOMBER DOES NOT ACHIEVE THE\nGOAL. THE BOMBER OR MORE LIKELY MORE\nTHAN ONE. A COUPLE MAYBE.\nWITHIN 11 HOURS, WE HAVE THESE INCIDENTS IN NEW YORK CITY.\nTHAT'S ONLY A TWO-HOUR DRIVE. ON A SATURDAY, IT'S 80 MILES\nFROM SEASIDE PARK TO CHELSEA. IT'S 80 MILES FOR PEOPLE WHO\nDON'T LIVE IN THE AREA SO THEY UNDERSTAND.\nON A SATURDAY, THERE'S NOT COMMUTER TRAFFIC.\nYOU CAN GET THERE PRETTY QUICK. THIS COULD BE A RELATED ACT.\nIT'S NOT TRUE -- I CAN -- I CAN CITE YOU CHAPTER AND VERSE IN\nCASES THAT I WAS INVOLVED IN THAT BOMBERS ALWAYS MAKE THE\nSAME BOMB. THAT'S NOT THE CASE.\nSOMETIMES THERE'S SIGNATURES THAT RUN THROUGH BOMBS.\nTHAT'S TRUE. I WOULD BE NOT SURPRISED TO SEE\nTHE SAME WIRE, TAPE IN BOTH OF THOSE CASES, NEW YORK AND\nSEASIDE PARK. WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME AT ALL.\nEVEN THE SAME TOOL MARKS. BOMBERS DON'T ALWAYS MAKE THE\nSAME BOMB.  FIVE DIFFERENT BOMBS.\nREMOTELY DETONATED. TIMER DETONATED.\nGASOLINE, DYNAMITE. YOU WOULD SAY THEY'RE NOT THE\nSAME BOMBER AND YET THEY WERE WHEN WE CAUGHT THEM.\nTHAT DOESN'T ALWAYS HOLD TRUE. IF PEOPLE LOOK AT THE PRESSURE\nCOOKER AND SAY THAT'S A PIPE BOMB, THAT'S THE WRONG ANALYSIS.\nTHE ANALYSIS HERE IS THIS FORMULA IS ON PAGE 40 OF\n\"INSPIRE\" MAGAZINE. RIGHT EXACTLY DOWN THE ROAD.\nWHOEVER DID THAT BOMBING IN SEASIDE PARK -- I KNOW THAT\nCOMMUNITY. BEEN THERE MANY TIMES.\nTHERE'S 2200 PEOPLE LIVE THERE. IT'S A SHORE TOWN.\nTHOSE HOUSES ARE EXPENSIVE. THOSE BOMBERS DON'T LIVE THERE.\nTHE BOMBERS DON'T LIVE THERE. THEY WENT THERE.\nTHEY WENT THERE TO TARGET THE MARINE RUN.\nBUT FOR THE RUN WAS DELAYED, WE WOULD HAVE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE\nHURT. BUT FOR THE BOMB MALFUNCTIONED.\nANOTHER THING I WOULD ADD IN MY ANALYSIS -- WE HAVE A LITTLE\nMORE ROOM TO MAKE AN ANALYSIS, BECAUSE WE ARE NOT DIRECTING THE\nCASE. I SALUTE CHIEF O'NEILL AND THE\nFBI ASSISTANCE DIRECTOR AND THE MAYOR.\nTHEY ARE DOING WHAT I HAD TO DO FOR MANY YEARS.\nYOU HAVE TO BE MORE CLOSE CROPPED WHEN YOU ARE THE\nCOMMANDER. WHEN WE'RE AN ANALYST FOR NBC,\nWE CAN TALK WIDER. THAT'S WHAT THE VIEWERS WANT.\nTHEY WANT TO KNOW, WHAT'S YOUR EXPERIENCE TELL YOU?\nHERE ARE SOME BOMBS -- THIS BOMB -- THIS SECOND BOMB AT 27th\nSTREET, IF IT TURNS OUT TO BE A REAL BOMB -- WE HEARD IT BOTH\nWAYS. IF IT TURNS OUT TO BE REAL, THE\nBOMB MALFUNCTIONED. IF IT'S A REAL BOMB, THE BOMB\nMALFUNCTIONED. IT MALFUNCTIONED BECAUSE A\nPERSON WHO IS LEAVING A BOMB IN A CROWDED NEW YORK CITY STREET\nIS NOT LEAVING A BOMB FOR SHOW. IT'S NOT LEAVING A BOMB FOR YOU\nTO FIND IT. IT MALFUNCTIONED.\nTHE BOMB IN NEW JERSEY ALSO MALFUNCTIONED.\nYOU HAVE SOME AMATEUR -- IF THEY ARE CONNECTED.\nIT'S POSSIBLE. I'M NOT SAYING THEY ARE\nDEFINITELY. IT'S POSSIBLE.\nMALFUNCTIONS, ATTEMPTS. YOU MAY HAVE SOME INSPIRED\nACTORS HERE. READING \"INSPIRE\" MAGAZINE, A\nCOUPLE OF BOMBS THAT MALFUNCTIONED.\nTHEY HAVE A LOT OF DESIRE. THEY HAVE A LOT OF EFFORT.\nI WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE THE EXPLOSIVE FILLER MATCH IN\nTHOSE CASES. THEY ARE SO CLOSE IN PROXIMITY,\nIN TIME. THEY ARE OFF THE ONE PAGE 40 OF\nTHE MAGAZINE. WHEN BOMBERS FAIL, THEY KEEP\nGOING. THEY KEEP GOING.\nTHEY PROGRESS. THEY WANT -- THESE ARE -- EVEN\nIF THEY ARE SEPARATE BOMBERS, WHICH IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE,\nTHEY FAILED BOTH TIMES. THEY FAILED TO KILL PEOPLE IN\nNEW JERSEY AND IN NEW YORK. THEIR GOAL IS MURDER.\nTHEY ARE FAILING. >> BUT THEY DID HAVE ONE\nEXPLOSION THAT WAS PRETTY DARN POWERFUL.\nTHEY DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY. BY ALL ACCOUNTS, ALL 29 PEOPLE\nTHAT WERE INJURED ARE OUT OF THE HOSPITAL.\nWE DON'T HAVE ANY REPORT WITH LIFE-THREATENING CONDITIONS.\nI'M SURE THEY WOULD BE IN THE HOSPITAL WERE THAT TO BE THE\nCASE. THEY DID SUCCEED WITH ONE.\n>> WELL, I THINK YOU ARE RIGHT. THEY INJURED SOME PEOPLE.\nBUT THEIR GOAL IS MURDER. MASS MURDER.\nTHEY DIDN'T ACHIEVE THAT. THAT'S THE REAL GOAL.\nTHEY PROBABLY FAILED THERE IN THE PLACEMENT.\nWHEN THEY PUT IT INTO THE TRASH BIN, THAT ACTED AS A TOTAL\nCONTAINMENT VESSEL LIKE THE BOMB SQUAD TOOK AWAY TO ROBIN'S NECK.\nIT ACTED LIKE THAT. THEY THOUGHT IT MIGHT ENHANCE\nTHE BLAST. BECAUSE THE EXPLOSIVE CHARGE WAS\nNOT LARGE ENOUGH, IT MOSTLY CONTAINED THE FRAGMENTATION FROM\nWHATEVER THEIR BOMB CONTAINER WAS.\nOTHERWISE, WE WOULD HAVE HAD PIECES OF THE PRESSURE COOKER,\nIF THAT'S WHAT IT WAS, FLUNG ALL OVER 23rd STREET AND WE WOULD\nHAVE MORE DEVASTATING INJURIES. IT ACTED AS A BOMB CONTAINMENT\nVESSEL. THAT'S PROBABLY THE FAILURE OF\nTHEM WHEN THEY PUT IT IN THERE. THE BOMB ON 27th STREET WAS JUST\nA PLASTIC BAG AND ON THE SIDEWALK.\nIT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE DEVASTATING.\nI BELIEVE THAT PROBABLY MALFUNCTIONED IF IT'S REAL.\n>> JIM AND DON, CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH.\nI THINK JIM YOU PUT IT APTLY THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO BRING YOUR\nEXPERTISE TO OUR BROADCAST AND LET US KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.\nSPECULATION AND IT HELPS GET US THROUGH.\nTHANK YOU VERY MUCH. APPRECIATE THAT.\nWE ARE APPROACHING THE TOP OF THE HOUR.\nSTAY WITH US FOR MORE ON THIS BREAKING NEWEVELOPMENTS HERE\nON MSNBC AT THE TOP OF THE HOUR.", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1474221935768.1474218954557.440efce4-8fd0-4137-9144-c13b2600595a.segment0.thumb.jpg", "channel": "347"}, {"start": 736750.0, "length": 89940.0, "end": 826690, "date": 1474219197080, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1474221928565.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1474218954557-440efce4-8fd0-4137-9144-c13b2600595a-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=736.75,826.69", "text": ">>> AS GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK,\nTHIS IS MY WORST NIGHTMARE. >> I THOUGHT IN MY MIND THAT A\nBUILDING WAS COLLAPSING. >> IT WAS LIKE, WAIT A MINUTE.\nWHAT IS THAT EXPLOSION?

BUT I WILL SAY THAT THIS DOESN'T\nSEEM TO BE THE KIND OF ATTACK THAT ONE WOULD STAGE IF YOU ARE\nWANTING TO KILL MANY PEOPLE. PUTTING A BOMB IN THE DUMPSTER\nOR PUTTING IT BY WITH THE TIMER BY A AREA IS NOT WHAT WE HAVE\nSEEN WHERE PEOPLE OPEN FIRE WITH ASSAULT RIFLES AND THINGS LIKE THAT.\n>> RICHARD ENGEL JUST HAPPENED TO BE THERE AT THE SCENE.\nAND THAT EXPLOSION AS RICHARD WAS REFERRING TO WAS NOT THE\nONLY EVENT YESTERDAY. MAYBE THEY ARE UNRELATED OR MAY\nBE, BECAUSE THERE WAS AN INCIDENT WHERE A PIPE BOMB\nEXPLOSION ALONG A RACE THAT RICHARD WAS TALKING ABOUT, IS\nBEING INVESTIGATED AS A POTENTIAL TERROR INCIDENT, AND\nNOBODY WAS HURT THERE, AND NINE PEOPLE WERE INJURED IN ST.\nCLOUD, MINNESOTA, WHERE A MAN WITH A KNIFE ASSAULTED PEOPLE\nAND MADE REFERENCES TO ALLAH. AND SO LET ME START WITH PETE.\nLET ME START WITH THE NEW YORK INCIDENT, AND THE MAYOR BILL De\nBLASIO SAID IT IS NOT CLEAR IT IS A TERROR INCIDENT, BUT WHAT\nDID HE MEAN? IT IS AN INTENTIONAL DEVICE, AND\nWE ARE PARSING THE WORDS. >> YES, WHEN HE WAS SPEAKING, HE\nSAID THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO SAY WHETHER IT IS A\nTERRORIST INCIDENT OR NOT. BUT THERE IS A CONSIDERABLE ALT\nOF LUCK HERE, CHARLES. THE BOMB WENT OFF BEFORE THE\nRACE STARTED AND THE RACE WAS DELAYED AND THATIS LUCK NUMBER\nONE. AND SECONDLY, THE DEVICE IN NEW\nJERSEY WHICH IS THREE PIPE BOMBS TAPED TOGETHER DIDN'T GO OFF\nENTIRELY. AND SO A LOT OF EVIDENCE WAS\nLEFT BEHIND. THAT IS THE SECOND PIECE OF GOOD\nLUCK. AND THE THIRD PIECE OF GOOD\nLUCK, THE PRESSURE COOKER IN NEW YORK ALSO DID NOT GO OFF, SO\nTHERE IS A LOT OF EVIDENCE FOR THE INVESTIGATORS THE LOOK AT,\nAND ONE BIG QUESTION, WHAT IS IN COMMON WITH THE TWO DEVICES, THE\nONE IN NEW JERSEY AND THE ONE IN NEW YORK ASSUMING THEY CAN\nULTIMATE I WILL SEE. >> SO THE INVESTIGATES ARE\nWORKING NEW JERSEY AND NEW YORK AS POTENTIALLY ONE GROUP?\n>> WELL, THEY WANT TO KNOW IF THERE IS A CONNECTION OR SAME\nPERSON OR GROUP, AND BROADLY SPEAKING, SIMILARITIES.\nELECTRONIC TIMERS AND CELL PHONE ON BOTH OF THESE THING, BUT\nTHESE ARE THE INSTRUCTIONS THAT ARE WIDELY AVAILABLE.\nTHE AL QAEDA MAGAZINE \"INSPIRE\" THEY HAVE RUN ARTICLES ON HOW TO\nTHE BUILD SIMILAR DEVICES.

MATTHEW HORACE FORMER ATF\nEFFECTIVE, ART RODERICK AND RETIRED U.S. MARSHAL, TOM\nFUENTES AND FORMER FBI ASSISTANT DIRECTOR, AND JULIET CAYENNE.\nGOOD TO SEE ALL OF YOU. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MINNESOTA\nCASE FIRST. WE'RE STILL AWAITING THE PRESS\nCONFERENCE OUT OF SAINT CLOUD, THE SHOPPING MALL TERRORIZED BY\nTHE SUSPECT WHO WAS WEARING A PRIVATE SECURITY FIRM UNIFORM\nSAY POLICE. AND STABBED UPWARDS OF NINE\nPEOPLE BEFORE AN OFF DUTY POLICE OFFICER SHOT AND KILLED HIM.\nSO I ONE EWONDER, MATTHEW, HOW THEY GO ABOUT DETERMINING\nWHEREIN DEED HE IS A SOLDIER OF ISIS AS ISIS HAS CLAIMED THIS\nSUSPECT TO BE? HOW DO THEY GO ABOUT DETERMINING\nWHETHER HE WAS ON A MISSION ORDERED BY ISIS?\n>> AS YOU KNOW, EARLY ON IN INVESTIGATIONS, INFORMATION IS\nCOMING IN FAST AND FURIOUSLY. AND AS THINGS EVOLVE, THINGS\nCHANGE HAVERY QUICKLY. FBI WILL BE CHECKING SOCIAL\nMEDIA, SPEAKING TO HIS FAMILY, TRYING TO DETERMINE IF HE'S A\nSYMPATHIZER, SUPPORTER OR MAYBE NOT INVOLVED AT ALL.\nSO EARLY INDICATION SOMETIMES CHANGE.\nTHEY WILL DETERMINE IT OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS.\n>> AND FROM WHAT WE UNDERSTAND IN OUR REPORTING, HE WENT TO\nVARIOUS SECTIONS OF THE SHOPPING MALL AND STABBED PEOPLE BEFORE\nTHIS OFF DUTY OFFICER THEN SHOT AND KILLED HIM.\nWHAT MORE WILL INVESTIGATORS BE TRYING TO COMB THROUGH, WHAT\nKIND OF INFORMATION WOULD THEY BE ABLE TO ASCERTAIN FROM THAT\nSHOPPING MALL, THE SCENE OF THE CRIME?\n>> A LOT LESS THAN I THINK WHAT WILL BE AT HIS HOME.\nSO -- BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO GET THE ISIS CONNECTION.\nICE HAS CLAIMED CREDIT THAT THEY INSPIRED HIM, SO IT WILL BE\nSOCIAL MEDIA, WHO HE HAS TALKED TO, EITHER OPEN SOURCE OR BACK\nSOURCE INFORMATION. THE ATTACK ITSELF IS NOT\nSOPHIS SOPHISTICATED.\nA KNIFE IN A SHOPPING MALL, YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET\nTARGETS. AND I THINK THAT IT'S JUST A\nREMINDER TO ALL OF US, WHETHER THESE ISSUES -- WHETHER THESE\nATTACKS ARE RELATED OR NOT OVER THE COURSE OF 24 HOUR, THEY HAVE\nA COMMONALTY WHICH IS OUR HOMELAND SECURITY APPA RAT\nTUESDAY IS LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS.\nAND EMERGENCY MANAGERS AND PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS.\nTHERE IS NO COUNTERTERRORISM OR HOMELAND SECURITY GROUP OUT\nTHERE WAITING FOR SOMETHING BAD  ITS 'S FIRST RESPONDERS IN PLAC\nTHAT WE'VE NEVER HEARD OF. >> AND TOM, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO\nHEAR OUT OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE?\n>> I THINK I'D LIKE TO HEAR THAT THEY HAVE SPECIFIC INFORMATION\nABOUT WHETHER OR NOT HE WAS TIED TO OTHER INDIVIDUALS, EITHER BY\nCOMMUNICATION OR SOCIAL MEDIA AS JULIET MENTIONED.\nAND JUST SEE.

SO THAT NUMBER ONE TO ME.\nWHAT STRUCK ME, TWO MASS CASUALTY EVENTS, THIRD ONE COULD\nHAVE BEEN IF THE RACE HAD GONE OFF ON TIME.\nAND BY THE GRACE OF GOD, WE HAVE AN OFF DUTY POLICE OFFICER THAT\nWAS ABLE TO STOP THE FIRST MASS CASUALTY EVENT.\nYOU HAVE THIS BOMB GOING OFF IN NEW YORK CITY, LUCKILY NOBODY\nWAS KILLED. SO WE DONED A LOT OF BULLETS\nHERE.

YOU HAVE HIM ASKING INDIVIDUALS\nARE YOU MUSLIM. YOU HAVE THE ATTACKS GOING ON,\nPOSSIBLE ATTACK IN NEW JERSEY. AND WHAT HAPPENED IN NEW YORK.\nMAYBE NOT GREDIRECTLY, BUT WHY THEY OCCUR WITHIN 24 HOURS, WAS\nTHERE A CALL OUT BY ISIS? IS IT LONE WOLF?\nYOU PUT ALL IT TOGETHER, THERE IS JUST NO -- TO ME, NO\nCOINCIDENCE THAT THESE THREE EF\nEVENTS OCCURRED IN A 24 HOUR TIME PERIOD.\n>> ALL RIGHT, WE HAVE NEW INFORMATION THAT NOW AN\nINVESTIGATION IS UNDER WAY TO PERHAPS HELP SUBSTANTIATE\nWHETHER THERE IS INDEED A CONNECTION BETWEEN WHAT HAPPENED\nIN NEW JERSEY, THE DEVICES FOUND DURING THAT 5 K MARINE CORPS RUN\nAND WHAT HAPPENED IN LOWER MANHATTAN IN CHELSEA.\n>> THAT'S RIGHT. THEY HAVE FOUND SOME\nSIMILARITIES IN THE CELLPHONES THAT WERE USED TO PERHAPS\nDETONATE THE DEVICES. SO THAT'S WHAT INVESTIGATORS ARE\nBE LOOKING AT, FOR SOME CLUES. THERE IS NOTHING TO SAY THAT THE\nINCIDENTS IN NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY ARE DIRECTLY LINKED, BUT\nDEFINITELY THEY ARE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE SIMILARITIES.\nOTHER THAN THAT, THERE ARE NO SIMILARITIES.\n>> SO EVEN THOUGH INITIALLY THESE WERE DETERMINED THAT THERE\nWERE PIPE BOMB, AT LEAST ONE PIPE BOMB IN NEW JERSEY IN THE\nSEASIDE PACK AREA, VERSUS PRESSURE COOKERS, OR AT LEAST\nONE INTACT PRESSURE COOKER IN CHE\nCHELSEA? >> RIGHT.\nTHEY BELIEVE THERE WAS AT LEAST ONE PRESSURE COOKER WHICH THEY\nFOUND ON 27th STREET. THE DEVICES THAT THEY FOUND IN\nNEW JERSEY ARE PIPE BOMBS. SO, YES, THAT'S A DIFFERENCE.\nTHAT IS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE.\nBUT WHAT WAS USED TO DETONATE THE PIPE BOMB THEY BELIEVE WAS A\nCELLPHONE WITH LIKE A SORT OF -- WHICH WAS BEING USED AS A TIMER\nTO SORT OF DETONATE IT. SO PERHAPS MAYBE LIKE THE ALARM\nWAS USED ON THE PHONE SET TO A CERTAIN TIME, AND THEN IT WOULD\nHAVE CAUSED THE EXPLOSION.", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1474224172339.1474220734626.bdedcfa5-4f39-4ca6-9444-d95e053cdbab.segment6.thumb.jpg", "channel": "202"}, {"start": 77083.0, "length": 480605.0, "end": 557688, "date": 1474224654138, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1474227839410.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1474224335502-49cc8956-1b8b-4725-9910-3551a6957f80-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=77.08,557.69", "text": ">>> WELCOME BACK.\nWE'RE FOLLOWING TWO MAJOR BREAKING NEWS STORIES TODAY.\nYOU JUST SAW THE PRESS CONFERENCE OUT OF ST.

CLOUD.\nNICK IS VOL FOL LOWING THAT. AND NICK, IT WAS CLEAR THAT\nINVESTIGATORS WANTED TO SPEND LESS TIME ON THE SUSPECT AND\nMORE ON THE HEROICS OF THE OFF DUTY POLICE OFFICER.\nWOINT REVEAL THE IDENTITY OF THE SUSPECT, BUT HE HAS BEEN TAKEN\nOUT. >> WE'VE REACHED OUT TO MR.\nFAULKNER TO GET COMMENT, BUT HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO GET IN TOUCH\nWITH HIM, BUT PHENOMENAL DETAILS PROVIDED THAT MR. FAULKNER, THIS\nOFFICER WHO WAS OFF DUTY BUT AT MALL, ENGAGING THIS SUSPECT,\nSHOOTING HIM MULTIPLE TIMES. GETTING UP THREE TIMES BEFORE\nBEING SHOT DEAD. THIS SUSPECT NOW, THE ONLINE\nMEDIA WING OF ISIS CALLED -- HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY.\nSO FAR CNN HAS BEEN UNABLE TO AWE AUTHENTICATE THIS CLAIM, BUT\nIT FOLLOWS A -- CLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR INDIVIDUALS\nINSPIRED BY ISIS. JUST A SHORT TIME AGO, THE\nSPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE THERE, RICK THORNTON, SAYING THIS ACT\nIS BEING INVESTIGATED AS A POTENTIAL ACT OF TERRORISM.\nHOWEVER, THEY ARE UNSURE IF THIS SUSPECT HAD ANY COMMUNICATION\nWITH THE TERROR GROUP. THEY DID MENTION THEY'VE\nEXECUTED AT LEAST TWO SEARCH WARRANTS AT ONE RESIDENTS OF\nTHIS INDIVIDUAL. HIS CAR ALSO FOUND IN THE\nPARKING LOT IMPOUNDED. THERE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE A\nTHREAT TO THE COMMUNITY THERE, BUT THEY DID MENTION WILLIAM\nANDERSON, THE LOCAL POLICE CHIEF THERE, AN IRONY THAT THIS\nHAPPENED ON THE SAME DAY OF EXPLOSIONS IN NEW YORK AS WELL\nAS NEW JERSEY, WE KNOW FROM OUR SHIMONE, THAT VEST GARRETTS ARE\nLOOKING AT CLUES THERE IN NEW JERSEY AND NEW YORK FOR\nSIMILARITIES, PERHAPS IF THERE'S ANY COINCIDENCES.\nALSO BROUGHT UP AT THIS PRESS CONFERENCE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY\nCONNECTION ON WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY ON WHAT TURNED OUT TO\nBE HORRIFIC TRAGIC NIGHT THAT COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT WORSE.\n>> KEEP US POSTED ON THE INVESTIGATION IN ST. CLOUD,\nMINNESOTA. LET'S TALK ABOUT NOW, WHAT CNN\nIS REPORTING AS SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THESE EXPLOSIONS ON THE\nLEFT, YOU'RE SEEING IN CHELSEA, THIS IS THE DUMPSTER AT WEST\n23rd AND 6th AVENUE. IT CAUSED SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE\nTHERE AND INJURED 29 PEOPLE. ALL OF WHOM HAVE BEEN RELEASED\nFROM THE HOSPITAL. THEN TO YOUR RIGHT, YOU'RE\nSEEING THE REMNANTS, THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY ANOTHER EXPLOSIVE\nDEVICE IN SEASIDE, NEW JERSEY, OVER THE WEEKEND.\nABOUT THE TIME WHEN A 5K RUN WAS SUPPOSED TO TAKE PLACE THERE.\nI'VE GOT THE PANEL BACK WITH ME. YOU'VE SEEN THEM ALL AFTERNOON\nLONG. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THROUGH YOUR\nSOURCES, THAT YOU'RE LEARNING THERE ARE SIMILARITIES\nINVESTIGATORS ARE LOOKING AT BETWEEN WHAT HAPPENED IN ENERGY\nAND IN NEW YORK. >> RIGHT.\nLET'S GO THROUGH THOSE. FIRST OF ALL, THE CELL PHONE,\nWHICH WAS THE DETONATOR USED IN THE DEVICES IN NEW JERSEY.\nTHREE OF THEM. ONLY ONE WENT OFF.\nIT WAS AN OLDER MODEL TYPE CELL PHONE AND WE'RE TOLD IT'S A VERY\nSIMILAR TYPE OF BRAND OF CELL PHONE.\nWAS ALSO FOUND IN THE TWO INCIDENTS IN NEW YORK.\nTHE BOMB THAT DID GO OFF ON 23rd STREET, AS WELL AS THE PRESSURE\nCOOKER DEVICE FOUND ON 27th STREET.\nWE KNOW THAT THE AUTHORITIES HAVE ESTABLISH THAT HAD THE 27th\nSTREET DEVICE DID NOT EXPLODE. THE ONE FOUND ON THE STREET WAS\nA DEVICE THAT COULD HAVE KILLED PEOPLE.\nIT WAS A REAL BOK. IT WAS SOMETHING STILL UP IN THE\nAIR LAST NIGHT. SO, WE KNOW THAT THESE DEVICES,\nTHE TYPE OF DETONATOR WAS USING A CELL PHONE AS SOME TYPE OF AN\nALARM R OR A TIMING DEVICE, SO THERE WASN'T ANY PHONE CALL TO\nDETONATE. THIS WASN'T SET OFF BY MAKING A\nPHONE CALL AS PERHAPS SOME MIGHT ASSUME.\nIF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A CELL PHONE INSTEAD, IT WAS SIMPLY A\nTIMING DEVICE. THERE'S RECIPES THAT HAVE THIS\nTYPE OF DEVICE, WE'VE LEARNED FROM TALKING TO SOURCES THAT THE\nFOUND O USE OF BLACK POWDER. THAT'S A VERY COMMON INGREDIENT.\nYOU CAN BUY AT ANY HARD WEAR STORE, AT WALL MRT, AROUND THE\nCOUNTRY. A VERY COMMON TYPE OF EXPLOSIVE\nDEVICE THAT YOU CAN USE, MAKE AT HOME.\nCLEARLY, THERE WAS SOME EXPERTISE HERE.\nBECAUSE A COUPLE OF THESE WERE ABLE TO GO OFF AND HURT PEOPLE\nIN NEW YORK, BUT SOME DID NOT GO OFF.\nSO PERHAPS WHOEVER WAS BEHIND THIS, IF THERE WERE MULTIPLE\nPEOPLE HERE BEHIND THESE THINGS, THERE WERE SOME JUST LIMITED\nEXPERTISE IN PUTTING THEM TOGETHER.\n>> AND WHILE THERE ARE SIMILARITIES UNDERSCORED BY THE\nCELL PHONES, THERE ARE GREAT DIFFERENCE IN THESE DEVICES, BUT\nHOW MIGHT THAT FURTHER COMPLICATE THINGS FOR\nINVESTIGATOR SNS. >> WELL, I THINK WHAT'S, IT\nCO COMPLICATES THEM BECAUSE THEY\nCAN'T FIND A DIRECTION LINK. NO ONE HAS TOLD US THERE'S\nDIRECT LINK. CERTAINLY, IT'S RAISED SOME\nSUSPICIOUS AMONG INVESTIGATORS, WHY WOULD YOU HAVE A SIMILAR\nPHONE ON THESE THREE DEVICES. SO THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE FOCUSING\nON RIGHT NOW. THE MATERIAL IN THE BOMBS ON\n23rd STREET AND 27th STREET. DOESN'T NECESSARILY MATCH WHAT'S\nIN NEW JERSEY, SO THAT'S DIFFERENT.\nTHE CELL PHONE IS THE KEY. THAT'S ABOUT THE ONLY THING THAT\nLINKS THESE DEVICES. RIGHT NOW, THEY'RE GOING TO RUN\nTHROUGH SYSTEMS NOW TO FIND OUT WHERE SOME OF THIS MATERIAL WAS\nPURCHASED. THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON NOW.\n>> DO YOU SEE SIGNIFICANCE IN THESE SIMILARITIES AND\nDIFFERENCE? NEW JERSEY AND NEW YORK?\nSFWL TO ME, THE DIFFERENCE MEANS TL MAYBE MORE THAN ONE\nINDIVIDUAL THAT CREATES A MORE SCARIER SCENARIO, BUT I THINK\nFROM AN INVESTIGATE, PURELY AN INVESTIGATIVE STANDPOINT, YOU\nHAVE TO ASSUME THERE'S SOME CONNECTION AND LAW ENFORCEMENT\nWILL GATHER EVIDENCE TO SHOW THERE'S NOT A CONNECTION BUT\nTHAT THERE IS A CONNECTION. IF YOU DO IT THE OTHER WAY\nAROUND AND LOOK AT THESE TWO INCIDENTS IN A VACUUM, YOU COULD\nMISS SOME INFORMATION HERE, SO YOU'VE GOT THE JTTF IN NEW YORK\nCITY. THE JTTF IN NEW JERSEY WORKING\nTOGETHER AND I BELIEVE THEY'RE COORDINATING WITH THE JTTF IN\nMINNESOTA TO SEE IF THERE'S A CONNECTION.\n>> WOER GOING CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION.\nGOING TO TAKE A SHORT BREAK. WE'LL BE BACK WITH COVERAGE.", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1474227859408.1474224335502.49cc8956-1b8b-4725-9910-3551a6957f80.segment2.thumb.jpg", "channel": "202"}, {"start": 562750.0, "length": 548206.0, "end": 1110956, "date": 1474224654138, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1474227839410.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1474224335502-49cc8956-1b8b-4725-9910-3551a6957f80-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=562.75,1110.96", "text": ">>> WELCOME BACK.\nWE'RE ON TOP OF A COUPLE OF BREAKING STORIES TODAY.\nNINE PEOPLE STABBED AT SHOPPING MALL IN ST.

JESSICA SCHNEIDER IS FOLLOWING\nALL OF THAT FOR US. JESSICA?\n>> THIS INVESTIGATION VERY WIDE RANGING.\nYOU CAN SEE A FLURRY OF ACTIVITY BEHIND ME AS POLICE VEHICLES\nCOME IN AND OUT OF WHAT WAS A CRIME SCENE.\nWE'RE AT WEST 23rd STREET WHERE THE EXPLOSION WENT OFF AT 8:30.\nTHE COMMISSIONER SAYING ONE OF THE KEY COMPONENTS IS VIDEO.\nJAMES O'NEILL SAYING THAT THEY HAVE OBTAINED SURVEILLANCE VIDEO\nFROM ALL AROUND THIS AREA FROM THE TWO DISTINCT CRIME SCENES,\nWHERE THE UNEXPLODED PRESSURE COOKER WAS FOUND.\nTHE COMMISSIONER SAYING THEY ARE LOOKED AT THE VIDEO AND WE'VE\nGOTTEN A LOOK AS WELL. THIS IS A VERY BUSY BUSINESS\nDISTRICT WITH BARS, RESTAURANT, BUSINESSES, A LOT OF THEM.\nMOST HAVING SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS SO, WHAT WE'VE SEEN, WE SEE\nMOMENTS WHEN THE EXPLOSION WENT OFF, YOU SEE THE BURST OF LIGHT\nFROM THE EXPLOSION. YOU ALSO SEE THE REACTION FROM\nTHE PEOPLE ON THE STREET HERE. THIS HAPPENED AT 8:30 ON A\nSATURDAY NIGHT. THIS IS A VERY BUSY DISTRICT.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE LIVE HERE. THEY COME HERE FOR\nENTERTAINMENT. THERE'S CLUBS AND RESTAURANTS\nAND BARS. YOU CAN SEE FROM INSIDE ONE OF\nTHE BUSINESSES, THE SHATTERED GLASS OF O WINDOWS AND DOORS AND\nTHEN STARTLED AND DISTURBED AND UPSET REACTION FROM THE PEOPLE\nWHO ARE ON THE STREET, ON WEST 23rd RIGHT HERE.\nAS THEY SCATTER AND MOVE TO GET OUT OF THE WAY.\nTO FLEE THIS EXPLOSION SITE. SO NOW, INVESTIGATORS ARE\nLOOKING AT THIS VIDEO, PIECING IT TOGETHER.\nTHEY'RE ASKING WITNESSES FOR ADDITIONAL VIDEO AS WELL AND\nWE'RE LEARNING ONE OF THOSE VIDEOS THAT THEY GOT A HOLD OF\nDOES FEATURE AN INDIVIDUAL IN THE GENERAL AREA OF THIS\nEXPLOSION. INVESTIGATORS ARE TRYING TO\nFIGURE OUT IF THE INDIVIDUAL IS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EXPLOSION,\nTRYING TO IDENTIFY THIS INDIVIDUAL AS WELL.\nTHE OTHER KEY COMPONENT IN ADDITION TO THE VIDEO IS ALSO\nFORENSICS. THE STATE POLICE HAVE ALSO TAKEN\nTHE REMNANTS OF EXPLOSIVE DEVICE.\nALSO, THAT UNEXPLODED PRESSURE COOKER STATE POLICE ARE K LOOING\nAT THAT, THE BOMB SQUAD IS LOOKING AT THAT, BUT IT'S ALSO\nBEING LOOKED AT IN QUANTICO, VIRGINIA, SO MANY DIFFERENT\nAG AGENCIES.\nTHE FBI FIELD OFFICE HERE IN NEW YORK SAYING THIS CRIME SCENE\nWILL BE AS SUCH UNTIL WELL INTO THIS EVENING.\nTHESE STREET IN THE CHELSEA NEIGHBORHOOD WILL BE LOCKED DOWN\nFOR SOME TIME TODAY. GOVERNOR CUOMO WAS HEREEARLIER,\nSAID THE SUBWAYS SHOULD BE RUNNING TOMORROW.\nHE ALSO STRESSES HE'LL BE DEPLOYING 1000 GUARD MEMBERS\nINTO THE SUBWAY TERMINAL, BUS TERMINALS AND AT THE AIRPORT, SO\nOBVIOUSLY A WIDE RANGING INVESTIGATION.\nWITH A LOT OF PRECAUTIONS. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH.\nWE'LL CHECK BACK WITH YOU. LET ME BRING BACK OUR PANEL NOW.\nWE'VE GOT EVAN PEREZ, ART, MATTHEW, SHIMONE AND PAUL.\nWE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE REPORTED SIMILARITIES FROM\nSHIMONE AND EVAN'S REPORTINGING. SIMILARITIES OF CELL PHONES\nWITHIN THESE DEVICES, BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENCES IN THE\nDEVICES IN NEW JERSEY AND NEW YORK, SO MATTHEW, WE'RE TALKING\nABOUT SOME OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE SUBSTANCES, SUBSTANCES,\nTHINGS SEEM LIKE THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT AND WE'RE TALKING\nABOUT PRESSURE COOKER VERSUS ANOTHER DEVICE.\n>> NUMBER ONE, BLACK POWDER, COMMONLY USED IN THE USE OF PIPE\nBOMBS. FIRST RESPONDERS ARE PEOPLE\nWITNESSING INCIDENTS, THEY MAY SEE WE SAW A CHIT WHITE CLOUD OF\nSMOEX WHEN THE EXPLOSION OC OCCURRED.\nINVESTIGATORS KNOW BLACK POWDER MAY HAVE BEEN USED.\nTHE PRESSURE COOKER HAS BEEN SEPTEMBER LAB.\nTHEY CAN DETERMINE WHAT TYPE OF EXPLOSION WAS USED.\nTHE OTHER THING IS THE FRAGMENTS FROM THE PIPE BOMB THAT EXPLODED\nAND THE ONES THAT EXPLODED IN NEW YORK WILL BE EXAMINED TO TRY\nTO DETERMINE WHAT TYPE OF EXPLOSIVES IS ON THE INSIDE OF\nTHOSE PIECES AND THEY'LL PULL THIS TOGETHER FAIRLY QUICKLY FOR\nUS. >> ARE THESE ALL THINGS THAT CAN\nBE HOMEMADE, WHICH WOULD MAKE IT THAT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO\nTRACE? THE COMPONENTS, THE PURCHASE OF\nTHESE COMPONENTS TO FIND THE SUSPECTS?\n. >> WEAPONS OR NIGS, THE KEY PART\nHERE THAT I FIND INTERESTING WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE EVENTS IS\nTHAT WE HAD A GOOD COMBINATION OF POLICE WORK, LUCK AND MAYBE\nINCOMPETENCE ON THE PART OF THE BOMBMAKERS EITHER REPLACE M OF\nTHE BOMBS OR THINKING THERE WOULD BE A SYRUP THETIC\nEXPLOSION WITH THE DEVICE IN ENERGY, WHERE ONLY ONE OF THE\nPIPE BOMBS WENT OFF, THE OTHER TWO DIDN'T.\nTHAT'S KEY. THOSE OTHER TWO WERE ATTACKED.\nTHAT'S ANOTHER KEY PART, AS WELL AS THE OTHER DEVICE THAT DIDN'T\nGO OFF UP IN NEW YORK CITY. SO YOU'VE GOT GREAT POLICE WORK,\nA LITTLE BIT OF LUCK AND MAYBE INCOMPETENCE ON THE BOMB MAKER'S\nPART, ALL COMING TOGETHER TO REALLY MAKE THIS AN EVENT WHERE\nWE COULD HAVE HAD A LOT OF FATALITIES AND DID NOT.\n>> THERE MAY WITH A THINK THAG BECAUSE DEVICES ARE SO DIMPBTS,\nTHEY CAN'T BE FROM THE SAME GROUP OF INFLUENCE S. THAT\nREALLY THE CASE? >> I WOULD SAY I DON'T THINK\nANYONE REALLY KNOWS. I THINK SOME FOLKS WHO WE'VE\nTALKED SO, WE JUST DON'T KNOW. THAT'S PROBABLY THE BEST THING\nTO DO NOW. SOME ARE SAYING THIS COULD GO ON\nFOR WEEKS. >> A VERY BUSY WEEK IN NEW YORK.\nMEET THG WEEK AND NOW, THIS. >> THEY'RE ADDING EXTRA, EXTRA\nLAYERS AND SUBWAYS ALL OVER THE CITY.\nA LOT OF IT IS TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL SAFE, TOO.\nAND THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF WORK.\nI'M JUST SORT OF LOOKING AT 23rd STREET AND WHERE THE BLAST\nOCCURRED IN CHELSEA. IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THEY\nHAVE NOT FOUND ANY GOOD U SURVEILLANCE VIDEO TO SEE WHO\nDID THIS. IT'S CRAZY TO THINK THAT, BUT\nTHAT'S WHERE WE ARE NOW. JUST DON'T HAVE ANY GOOD LEADS\nOF WHO WAS BEHIND THIS. THERE'S A LOT OF WORK.\n>> AND PAUL, YOU'VE GOT THREE, THREE PIVOTAL INCIDENTS\nHAPPENING THIS WEEKEND.

IT'S SILENT.\nAS IT PERTAINS TO WHAT TOOK PLACE IN NEW JERSEY AND NEW\nYORK, DOES THAT SAY ANYTHING, INDICATE ANYTHING TO YOU?\n>> MAYBE. INCIDENTS IN NEW JERSEY, IN NEW\nYORK. THEY WOULD LOVE TO CLAIM SOME\nKIND OF OWNERSHIP BEFORE WORLD LEADERS COME TO NEW YORK.\nSO FAR, THEY HAVE PUT OFF NO PRIOR STATEMENT AT ALL SUGGESTS\nTHEY SAY THE INDIVIDUAL WAS RADICALIZED.\nTHAT MAY CHANGE IN THE HOURS AHEAD.\nBUT IF THEY HAD ANY INKLING THAT THIS GUY WAS DOING IT IN THEIR\nNAME, I THINK WE WOULD HAVE HAD A STATEMENT OUT THEM ALREADY.\nEVERY HOUR THAT GOES PAST AND THERE'S THO CLAIM FROM A DPROUP\nLIKE ISIS, WILL TELL US SOMETHING.\n>> GOT A LOT GOING ON.

TAKE A LOOK.\nYOU'RE GOING TO SEE THAT CAR THAT IS STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF\nTHE STREET, AN EXPLOSION RIGHT THERE.\nTHEN YOU'LL SEE PEOPLE SCATTERING JUST AS YOU SEE THE\nDEBRIS SCATTERING. PEOPLE RUNNING AWAY.\nCARS SPEEDING. INVESTIGATORS ARE NOW SAYING\nTHEY HAVE FOUND SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THAT DEVICE IN NEW YORK\nAND THE ONE THAT EXPLODED IN SEASIDE PARK, NEW JERSEY, ON THE\nSAME DAY THIS WEEKEND BEFORE A MARINE CORPS CHARITY 5K RUN.\nTHE INVESTIGATORS HAVE NOT CONCLUDED THE EVENTS IN NEW YORK\nAND NEW JERSEY ARE CONNECTED. MORE ON THE BREAKING NEWS OUT OF\nNEW YORK, I'LL BRING IN CNN'S DEB FEYERICK.\nWHAT MORE HAVE YOU LEARNED? >> ONE THING WE CAN IDENTIFY IS\nTHE SECOND DEVICE ON 27th STREET, THAT HAD A CELL PHONE\nATTACHED TO IT. WHAT THAT SUGGESTS ACCORDING TO\nEXPERTS IS THAT THERE WAS A HIGHER LEVEL OF SOPHISTICATION\nIN ORDER TO MAKE THAT DEVICE. THE BOMB SQUAD HAS BEEN HANDLING\nIT ALL AFTERNOON BECAUSE THAT DEVICE, BECAUSE IT DIDN'T\nEXPLODE, COULD HAVE ADDITIONAL CLUES.\nA FINGERPRINT. A PIECE OF HAIR.\nSOME OTHER SORT OF DNA THAT CAN HELP IDENTIFY WHO WAS\nRESPONSIBLE FOR THAT DEVICE. IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER THAT PERSON\nAND THE PERSON WHO PLANTED THE DEVICE HERE ON 23rd STREET, JUST\nBEHIND ME, WHETHER THEY ARE ONE AND THE SAME.\nALL OF THAT RIGHT NOW UNDER INVESTIGATION.\nI WALKED BY THERE A LITTLE WHILE AGO, AND YOU'VE GOT TEAMS OF\nFORENSIC INVESTIGATORS FROM THE FBI AND NYPD.\nTHEY'RE LOOKING AT EVERYSHRAPNE. TRYING TO IDENTIFY IF ANY OF IT\nIS FROM THE DEVICE OR WHETHER IT WAS COLLATERAL FROM THE IMPACT\nOF THE BLAST EXPLOSION. NOW, WE CAN TELL YOU THAT RIGHT\nNOW, THEY DON'T KNOW WHO IS RESPONSIBLE.\nNOBODY HAS STEPPED FORWARD TO CLAIM ANY RESPONSIBILITY.\nNOR DO THEY KNOW WHY IT WAS PLACED HERE IN CHELSEA.\nBUT THE NYPD HAS A VERY SOPHISTICATED SURVEILLANCE,\nSECURITY SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM THROUGHOUT THE CITY.\nTHEY'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT ALL VIDEO.\nIT'S NOT JUST VIDEO FROM STORES, BUT IT'S ALSO VIDEO THAT IS SORT\nOF STRATEGICALLY PLACED THROUGHOUT.\nSO THEY CAN MORE TORRNITOR WHAT GOING ON.\nTHIS IS VERY ACTIVE RIGHT NOW. YOU A LOT OF PEOPLE WORKING ON A\nLOT OF DIFFERENT COMPONENTS. AS FAR AS THIS OPERATIONAL\nSECURITY, THEY'RE NOT SAYING A LOT ABOUT WHAT THEY DO HAVE, BUT\nTHEY ARE MAKING EVERY EFFORT TO PROCESS EVERY PIECE OF EVIDENCE\nAS QUICKLY AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN, FREDRICKA.\n>> DEB, WE KNOW THE BLOCKADE IS UP.\nWE SEE THE POLICE VEHICLES BEHIND YOU.\nWE ALSO JUST SAW A MAN AND WOMAN WITH A STROLLER, BABY STROLLER,\nWALKING BEHIND YOU. THIS IS COMPLICATED PAUSE THIS\nIS A VERY RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITY. LOTS OF BUSINESSES, TOO.\nBUT HOW ARE PEOPLE ABLE TO LIVE THERE WITH THIS INVESTIGATION\nUNDERWAY, AND THE PROMISE OF A NEW WORK WEEK STARTING TOMORROW?\n>> WELL, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.\nTHAT'S AN EXCELLENT POINT. IT ALMOST REMINDS ME OF 9/11,\nWHEN IN ORDER TO GET ANYWHERE, YOU HAD TO SHOW IDENTIFICATION,\nSAYING YOU LIVED IN A CERTAIN PART OF TOWN.\nTHAT IS HAPPENING HERE. WE'VE SEEN A COUPLE OF PEOPLE\nWHO HAD TO SHOW A LICENSE TO INDICATE THAT THEY DO LIVE ON\n23rd STREET. THEY'RE NOT JUST LETTING ANYONE\nGO IN AND OUT. THEY'RE TRYING TO KEEP THIS\nSCENE AS SORT OF CALM AND AS PURE AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN.\nTHAT SPECIFICALLY IS TRUE FOR WHERE THEY'RE DOING THE MAJORITY\nOF WORK. IT HAS BEEN A DISRUPTION IN THIS\nENTIRE AREA. THE TIMING OF THIS DEVICE, ALSO\nVERY QUESTIONABLE. WHY THEY DID IT, YOU KNOW, AT\n8:00 ON A SATURDAY NIGHT IN AN AREA, WHILE THERE WERE A LOT OF\nPEOPLE, THERE WERE AREAS CLOSE BY THAT HAD EVEN MORE PEOPLE.\nWHY WAS IT IN A DUMPSTER? USUALLY, WHEN A BOMB SQUAD FINDS\nSOMETHING, IF THERE IS A THREAT OF DETONATION, THE FIRST THING\nTHEY'LL LOOK FOR IS A DUMPSTER THAT THEY CAN PUT IT IN IN ORDER\nTO BLUNT THE IMPACT. THAT MAY HAVE BEEN WHY SOME OF\nTHE INJURIES, FREDRICKA, WERE LESS THAN THEY OTHERWSE WOULD\nHAVE BEEN, HAD THAT DUMPSTER NOT BLUNTED THE IMPACT.\nALL OF THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT AUTHORITIES ARE LOOKING INTO AS\nTHEY TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHO DID IT AND WHY.\nTHE CELL PHONE, VERY DISCONCERNING.\nTHAT MEANS UNLIKE THE BOSTON MARATHON, WHERE THE BOMBERS WERE\nCLOSE TO THE DEVICE, WITH A CELL PHONE, YOU CAN BE A GREAT\nDISTANCE FROM THE DEVICE.

WE HAVE LUCK IN THE FACT THAT\nTHE BOMBERS WERE SORT OF INEPT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE\nBETWEEN THE EXPLOSION IN SEASIDE, WHERE IT BLEW THE\nBOTTOM OFF OF THE PLASTIC TRASH RECE\nRECEPTACLE, AND YOU SAW TWO TRASH RECEPTACLES NEXT TO IT\nTHAT WERE IN TACT. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE\nEXPLOSION IN CHELSEA, THERE IS A DIFFERENCE THERE.\nI THINK YOU HAVE THE INEPTNESS ON THE BOMB MAKER'S PART AND THE\nPLACEMENT OF THE DEVICE THAT SAVED A LOT OF PEOPLE IN BOTH\nOCCURRENCES. >> SO SAVED A LOT OF PEOPLE,\nMATTHEW, BUT MIGHT IT HAVE BEEN THE INTENT THAT IT WOULD BE USED\nTO INTENSIFY THE ATTACK? THAT IT WOULD LAUNCH ADDITIONAL\nSHR SHRAPNEL?\n>> SURE. EVERY BOMBER HAS A UNIQUE\nSIGNATURE. IN THIS CASE, WE'RE SEEING\nEVIDENCE NOW TO TELL US BOTH OF THE DEVICES THAT WENT OFF HAVE\nSIMILARITIES. THE PRESSURE COOKER BOMB DIDN'T\nGO OFF BUT IT MIGHT BE SIMILAR. >> THE ONLY SIMILARITY, THE CELL\nPHONE. >> YES.\n>> THE WIRING IS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE'VE UNDERSTOOD IN OUR\nINITIAL INFORMATION. ONE IS A PIPE BOMB.\nONE IS A PRESSURE COOKER. THERE ARE DYNAMICS.\nWHAT IS FUELING THE EXPLOSIVES MIGHT BE DIFFERENT, TOO.\n>> VERY WELL MIGHT BE. >> BLACK POWDER IN AT LEAST ONE.\n>> THE ONE WE SAW THE VIDEO OF EARLIER, CLEARLY A PLUME OF\nWHITE SMOKE. >> IN NEW YORK.\n>> IT TELLS US BLACK POWDER OR LITTLE EXPLOSIVE MIGHT HAVE BEEN\nUSED. THE OTHER CASES, THE\nSIMILARITIES BE COME. THE INVESTIGATORS WILL RUN DOWN\nTHE LEADS AND CONTINUE DOWN THE ROAD.\n>> WE'RE LOOKING AT VIDEO THAT WE RECEIVED ONLY WITHIN THE LAST\nHOUR AND A HALF OR SO. DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE OF THE\nEXPLOSION AT 8:30 LAST NIGHT IN CHELSEA THERE.\nYOU SEE EVERYONE IS GOING ABOUT BUSINESS AS USUAL.\nTHEN ONE OF THE CARS STOPS. THEN YOU SEE AN EXPLOSION BEHIND\nHIM. THEN YOU SEE PEOPLE, DEBRIS, ALL\nOF THAT KIND OF, YOU KNOW, IN RAPID MOTION THERE.\nART, DOES ANYTHING STAND OUT IN PARTICULAR AS YOU GET ANOTHER\nCHANCE TO LOOK AT THIS VIDEO IN TERMS OF HOW IT MIGHT REDIRECT\nTHIS INVESTIGATION? >> IT WAS A PRETTY INTENSE\nEXPLOSION, COMPARED TO WHAT HAPPENED AT SEASIDE.\nYOU SEE THE DEBRIS IMMEDIATELY FLYING AROUND.\nI THINK THE KEY PART HERE IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO PUT THIS\nDEVICE TOGETHER AND MAKE A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE OTHER\nDEVICE THAT WAS FOUND ON 27th STREET.\nTAKE A LOOK AT THE SIMILARITY IN THOSE TWO DEVICES.\nMORE THAN LIKELY, THEY WERE VERY SIMILAR.\nBUT THAT'S A PRETTY INTENSE EXPLOSION YOU'RE SEEING THERE.\nBLOWING WINDOWS OUT AND CREATING DAMAGE TO THE BUILDING THAT IT\nWAS NEAR. SO THAT'S AN INTENSE, INTENSE\nBLAST. VERY LUCKY THAT NOBODY LOST\nTHEIR LIVES DURING THIS EXPLOSION.\n>> TOM, YOUR OBSERVATION? >> WELL, I THINK IN LOOKING AT\nTHAT, IT ALMOST LOOKS TO ME LIKE THE CONCUSSION FROM THE BLAST\nMIGHT HAVE BLOWN LOOSE LEAVES OFF THE TREES.\nSOME OF WHAT WE SEE FALLING ON THE SIDEWALK, TO ME, APPEARS TO\nBE LEAVES FALLING DOWN. IT IS, YOU KNOW, AUTUMN NOW.\nWE'RE ABOUT TO HAVE THE LEAVES COME DOWN ON THEIR OWN.\nBUT THEY MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN A LITTLE BOOST FROM THE CONCUSSION\nOF THE BLAST. >> GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH.\nTOM, ART AND MATTHEW, THANK YOU SO MUCH.\nWE'LL PICK UP OUR CONVERSATION. WE'LL BE BACK IN A MOMENT.", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1474235909426.1474231559952.8bf826c4-e121-4e96-9b78-eb20f2e2308f.segment4.thumb.jpg", "channel": "202"}, {"start": 864833.0, "length": 931392.0, "end": 1796225, "date": 1474237248500, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1474236974500.80242861-e283-4743-908f-73b36200f533.mp4#t=864.83,1796.22", "text": ">>> TOP OF THE HOUR HERE IN THE\nCNN NEWSROOM. I'M POPPY HARLOW.\nTHE UNITED STATES MAY HAVE BEEN HIT WITH THREE SEPARATE TERROR\nATTACKS IN A DAY. FRIGHTENED PEOPLE ON THE\nSIDEWALKS RUNNING FOR SAFETY NOT KNOWING IF ANOTHER EXPLOSION WAS\nABOUT GO OFF. INVESTIGATORS SAY THAT BOMB AND\nAN EXPLOSION EARLIER HAVE THINGS IN COMMON.\nNO OFFICIAL CONNECTION AT THIS HOUR BUT THE FBI SAYS THEY ARE\nSIMILAR IN DESIGN. THE BOMBING IN NEW YORK CITY\nINJURED 29 PEOPLE. THANKFULLY, WE HAVE LEARNED THEY\nARE ALL OUT OF THE HOSPITAL. POLICE FOUND THE SECONDARY\nEXPLOSIVE DEVICE, A PRESSURE COOKER JUST FOUR BLOCKS FROM THE\nEXPLOSION SITE THAT DID NOT DETONATE.\nAS THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUES, IN MINNESOTA, AN ISIS LINKED\nNEWS AGENCY SAYS MAN WHO STABBED NINE PEOPLE WAS A SOLDIER IN THE\nISLAMIC STATE. THAT MAN IS DEAD, SHOT BY AN OFF\nDUTY POLICE OFFICER. MUCH MORE ON THAT THIS HOUR.\nWE BEGIN IN NEW YORK WHERE CITY AND STATE OFFICIALS ARE\nPROMISING THAT NEW YORK CITY WILL BE BACK TO QUOTE, BUSINESS\nAS USUAL TOMORROW AS THE WORKWEEK BEGINS.\nALSO AS GLOBAL LEADERS DESCEND ON THE CITY.\nSOME STREETS BLOCKED OFF WHILE OFFICIALS CONTINUE TO COMB THE\nAREA FOR CLUES. I UNDERSTAND THERE'S SOME\nACTIVITY BEHIND YOU. WHAT DO YOU SEE?\n>> Reporter: A LITTLE BIT OF ACT\nACTIVITY. YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO SEE THE TWO\nOFFICERS FROM THE NYPD INVESTIGATORS.\nTHEY ARE LOOKING AT A SUBARU THERE TO THE LEFT.\nTHERE'S ONE SQUAD CAR WITH POLICE OFFICERS.\nTHEY SEEM TO BE KEEPING AN EYE ON IT.\nUNCLEAR WHAT THAT CAR IS. WE KNOW THAT IT DOES HAVE NEW\nJERSEY PLATES. INVESTIGATORS ARE LOOKING FOR A\nPOSSIBLE CONNECTION BETWEEN THAT DEVICE THAT DETONATED IN NEW\nJERSEY AND THE ONE THAT DETONATED HERE YESTERDAY EVENING\nAT 8:30 ON WEST 23rd STREET. THE INVESTIGATION VERY MUCH IN\nFULL SWING. EVIDENCE BEING COLLECTED.\nINVESTIGATORS ARE LOOKING FOR ANY POSSIBLE CLUE, A WIRE, A\nDETONATOR, BOMB RESIDUE. ANYTHING THAT CAN GIVE THEM A\nBETTER PICTURE OF WHAT THAT DEVICE WAS MADE OF THAT\nEXPLODED. A KEY PIECE OF EVIDENCE WILL BE\nTHE DUMPSTER BECAUSE THE DUMPSTER WOULD HAVE ABSORBED A\nLOT OF IMPACT OF THE BLAST. SOMEBODY WHO SAID EARLIER SAID\nIF THEY FIND A BOMB, ONE THING THEY DUE IS THROW IT INTO A\nDUMPSTER BECAUSE THEY WANT TO MINIMIZE INJURIES.\nWE KNOW THEY ARE LOOKING AT THE DEVICE THAT WAS ON WEST 27th\nSTREET. THAT IS MORE CRITICAL BECAUSE IT\nWAS INTACT. THERE COULD BE SOME SORT OF DNA,\nA FINGER PRINT, HAIR. THEY ALSO KNOW HOW THE BOMB AND\nTHE DEVICE WAS MADE BECAUSE THERE WAS A CELL PHONE ATAMPED\nTO IT. SOMEONE I SPOKE TO SAID CELL\nPHONE IS A BIT TROUBLING BECAUSE IT SUGGESTS THAT WHOEVER MADE IT\nDID NOT HAVE TO BE CLOSE TO IT IN ORDER FOR IT TO DETONATE.\nTHEY COULD PLACE A CALL AND HAD IT GO OFF.\nIT'S DIFFERENT TO THE BOSTON MORTON BOMBING WHERE THE TWO IN\nTHAT PARTICULAR CASE WERE REALLY IN THE VICINITY OF THAT\nEXPLOSIVE DEVICE. ALL OF THAT RIGHT NOW UNDER\nREVIEW OF THE CELL PHONE. CRITICAL IN TERMS OF WHAT THE\nINVESTIGATION SUGGESTS. >> THEY'RE STILL ASKING ANYONE\nIN THE AREA IF THEY HAVE ANY VIDEO, OVERHEARD ANY\nCONVE CONVERSATION, ANYTHING AT ALL TO\nCALL THE TIPS NUMBER TO HELP POLICE GET TO THE BOTTOM OF\nTHIS. THEY DON'T KNOW THE MOTIVE AND\nTHEIR NOT NAMING ANYONE. LET'S BRING IN OUR PANEL.\nTHE FBI IS CALLING THIS THE THREE BOMBS IN NEW YORK SIMILAR.\nLET'S TALK TO ED DAVIS. HE WAS THE COMMISSIONER BACK IN\n2013 DURING THE BOSTON MARATHON BOMBING.\nALSO WITH ME CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST.\nTHANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. JUST TO BEGIN WITH YOU, LET'S\nCOMPARE YOUR REACTION IN THE FIRST HOURS AFTER THE HORRIFIC\nBOMBING IN BOSTON. THEY SAID IT WAS INTENTIONAL BUT\nDID NOT LICNK IT TO TERRORISM. WHAT WOULD MAKE THINK NOT MAKE\nTHE JUMP? >> I WAS IN NEW YORK ON FRIDAY\nNIGHT WITH THE COMMISSIONER AND I CAN TELL YOU THEY ARE DOING\nTHE SAME THING WES DID FOLLOWING THE MARATHON.\nTHEY ARE LOOKIN INAT THE EVIDEN. THERE IS A HESITANCE TO USE THE\nTERRORISM WORD. THERE'S A LOT OF POLITICAL\nREASONS FOR THAT. I THINK IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE\nTHERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES THAT MIGHT DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN WHAT\nWE WERE SEEING HERE IN NEW YORK AND WHAT HAPPENED IN THE\nMARATHON. I HAD TWO POWERF FUL BLASTS.\nI HAD A NUMBER OF VICTIMS, OVER 200 VICTIMS.\nI HAD SHRAPNEL ON THE GROUND. I HAD THESE GOING OFF IN CLOSE\nPROXIMITY IN TIME AND SPACE. WE BELIEVE THERE HAD TO BE TWO\nPEOPLE. THERE WAS A LOT OF INFORMATION\nTHAT WE HAD THAT MADE IT REALLY STRAIGHTFORWARD.\nI THINK MOSTLY, I SAT DOWN WITH RICK WHO WAS THE SPECIAL AGENT\nIN CHARGE OF THE FBI AND WE ALL HAD THE SAME FEELING.\nI THINK AT THAT POINT EVEN GOVERNOR PATRICK SAID THIS\nSHOULD GO TO THE FBI VERY QUICKLY.\nLITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT SITUATION IN NEW YORK BUT\nCLEARLY IT'S A DIFFICULT DECISION TO MAKE.\n>> THEY PUT THESE PIPE BOMBS IN A GARBAGE CAN.\nIN NEW JERSEY ONLY ONE DETONATED AND THEY PUT THIS IN A DUMPSTER\nIN NEW YORK. WHY?\n>> PROBABLY TO THWART THE EFFORTS OF IF YOU SEE SOMETHING,\nSAY SOMETHING. WHO'S GOING TO LOOK IN THE\nDUMPSTER OR INSIDE A TRASH CAN OR PLASTIC GARBAGE BAG THAT MAY\nBE INSIDE A BIGGER CONTAINER. IF YOU HAVE A LOOSE CONTAINER ON\nTHE SIDEWALK IT'S GOING TO BE MORE SUSPICIOUS.\nIT'S MORE LIKELY TO HAVE SOMEBODY CALL THE POLICE AND\nREPORT IT COMPARED TO DEBRIS THAT'S THROWN INTO A DUMPSTER OR\nA NORMAL TRASH CAN. >> OUR VIEWERS ARE LOOKING AT\nLIVE PICTURES OUT OF NEW YORK CITY TONIGHT JUST ALMOST 24\nHOURS AFTER THE BOMB EXPLODED ON WEST 23rd.\nTHEY HAVE POLICE TAPE AROUND THIS VEHICLE.\nWE DON'T KNOW WHY. THEY ARE SCOURING THE AREA FOR\nANY CLUES. THERE COULD BE THREE SEPARATE\nACTS IN ONE DAY. HERE IS SOME THINGS POSITIVE.\nIS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE EXEMPLOYES YESTERDAY MORNING WAS\nCALL TO ACTION FOR ANY SYMPATHIZERS?\n>> VERY WELL COULD BE. I DON'T WANT TO CLOSE OFF ANY\nPOSSIBILITY. I WOULD SAY THE NEW JERSEY\nBOMBINGS WERE PRETTY UNSUCCESSFUL.\nTHEY WEREN'T EVEN LEADING THE NEWS FOR MOST OF YESTERDAY.\nIN TERMS OF BEING CALL TO ACTION, IT'S A PRETTY SUBTLE OR\nUNSUCCESSFUL ONE. I'M DEFINITELY MUCH FOR SAYING\nTHAT THE TIES BETWEEN NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY MIGHT BE MORE\nLIKELY. LET'S BE CLEAR HERE, THOSE\nDEVICES ARE PRETTY RUDIMENTARY. THE INFORMATION IS OUT THERE ON\nTHE WEB FOR ANY GROUP TO TAKE. ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I'VE BEEN\nSORT OF MORE COMFORTABLE WAITING ON THE TERRORISM WORD,\nUNDERSTANDING THAT THERE'S TERROR OUT THERE IS BECAUSE THE\nINFORMATION RIGHT NOW IS CUTTING IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT\nDIRECTIONS. THERE'S PIECES THAT AREN'T\nMAKING A LOT OF SENSE TO US THAT KNOW THE CASES.\nTHE INVESTIGATORS SHOULD CONTINUE WITH THE OPEN\nINVESTIGATION UNTIL THEY CAN NARROW IT DOWN.\n>> WAS IT FOR YOU AND YOUR TEAM AND THE FBI IN BOSTON WAS THE\nMOST HELPFUL TO IDENTIFYING THE SARNAEV BROTHERS WHERE THE BOMBS\nWENT OFF IN BOSTON AND THE BOMB WENT OFF HERE IN NEW YORK CITY\nLAST NIGHT. OBVIOUSLY, A LOT OF CAMERAS IN\nTHE AREA. WHAT WAS THE SINGLE MOST HELPFUL\nTHING IN IDENTIFYING THE BROTHERS?\n>> THE FORENSIC EVIDENCE IS IMPORTANT.\nYOU HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT DEVICES WERE USED.\nTHE BIGGEST BREAK CAME FROM VIDEO.\nIT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE. THIS DIGITAL EVIDENCE THAT WE\nCAN ACCESS NOW IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF\nEVIDENCE. I SPOKE TO THE POLICE\nCOMMISSIONER IN LONDON AFTER THE BOMBINGS AND HE TOLD ME HE WOULD\nNOT HAVE SOLVED THE CASE IF IT WASN'T FOR VIDEO.\nNEW YORK IS SET UP IN A FAMILIAR FASHION AS FAR AS CITY OWNED\nVIDEO THAT'S AVAILABLE ON THE STREET.\nTHEY JUST HAVE TO PROCESS THAT. IT TAKES A LONG TIME.\nTHERE ARE NO SYSTEMS AVAILABLE TO DO IT AUTOMATICALLY.\nIT TAKES DAYS AND SOMETIMES WEEKS BEFORE THEY CAN GET TO THE\nRIGHT PLACE. YOU'RE ALREADY SEEING SOME\nMOVEMENT IN THAT AREA. THAT'S BEGIGOING TO BE THE SING\nMOST IMPORTANT THING. >> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE FACT\nTHAT MINNESOTA HAS HAD SOMEONE CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE\nINSPIRATION OF THE ATTACK THERE. THAT BEING ISIS.\nWHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE FACT THAT IN NEW JERSEY AND HERE IN\nNEW YORK ALMOST 24 HOURS LATER NO CLAIM OF RESPONSIBILITY?\n>> ISIS DOESN'T ALWAYS COME OUT IMMEDIATELY EVEN IN AN ISIS\nINSPIRED ATTACK. PART OF THE REASON MIGHT BE THE\nWAY THIS WAS INITIALLY REPORTED ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY SAID THE\nACT WAS INTENTIONAL BUT THEY WEREN'T GOING TO LINK IT TO\nTERRORISM THAT ISIS MAY HAVE BEEN A LITTLE CAUTIOUS THINKING\nTHIS COULD BE A PSYCHOPATH WHO LEARNED HOW TO MAKE A BOMB AND\nDECIDED TO DETONATE IT AND HARM PEOPLE AND GET ATTENTION AND\nISN'T REALLY A TRUE SOLDIER OF THE ISLAMIC STATE UNLIKE THE\nSITUATION IN MING YAP LIS WHERE THERE WAS MORE INFORMATION TO\nINDICATE IT PROBABLY WAS SOMEBODY INSPIRED BY ISIS.\n>> STAY WITH ME BECAUSE I WANT TO TAKE US BACK TO DEBRA ON THE\nGROUND TONIGHT. YOU HAVE POLICE VEHICLE IN FRONT\nOF THIS SUBARU THAT THEY ARE LOOKING AT.\nDO WE KNOW WHY? >> WE DON'T.\nIT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A FORENSIC INVESTIGATOR FROM THE NYPD.\nSHE'S TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS. IT LOOKS LIKE RIGHT NOW SHE IS\nSCRAPING OR TRYING TO GATHER EVIDENCE FROM THE VEHICLE.\nTHEY JUST BROUGHT IN THAT LARGE VEHICLE JUST MOMENTS AGO.\nTHIS CAR IS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST TO THEM.\nIT'S ALSO GOT NEW JERSEY PLATES ON IT.\nWHETHER THEY HAVE DETERMINED THERE'S A CONNECTION BETWEEN\nTHIS NEW JERSEY CAR AND PERHAPS THE INNOCENT THAT HAPPENED HERE\nON WEST 23rd STREET AND THE INCIDENT THAT HAPPENED OUT IN\nNEW JERSEY, WE DON'T KNOW. WE CAN ALSO SEE A COUPLE OF FIRE\nTRUCKS BEHIND US. WE DID CHECK WITH THE FIRE\nDEPARTMENT TO SEE IF IT WAS CONNECTED TO THE DISCOVERY OF\nTHIS VEHICLE. WE'RE TOLD THEY HAVE FIRE TRUCKS\nON SCENE. >> JUST SET UP FOR US WHERE YOU\nARE. IF WE CAN SEE THE RELATION OF\nWHERE YOU ARE TO THAT VEHICLE. WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME IS\nTHEY'RE NOT CLEARING YOU OUT. WE SAW THE 27th STREET LOCATION\nTHEY PUSHED RICHARD QUEST VERY QUICK VERBALLY SAYING MOVE OUT\nOF WAY. MOVE OUT OF WAY.\nWE KNOW THAT'S BECAUSE THE PRESSURE COOKER BOMB WAS THERE.\nYOU'RE A QUARTER OF A BLOCK AWAY AND THEY'RE NOT DOING THAT.\n>> THEY'RE NOT DOING THAT AT ALL.\nWE WERE QUITE CLOSE TO THE CAR. ONE THING I LEARN FRD THE BOSTON\nMARATHON IS IF YOU CAN SEE THE BOMB, THE BOMB CAN SEE YOU.\nTHE INVESTIGATORS THAT ARE WORKING THAT CAR AND TRYING TO\nGATHER EVIDENCE ARE NOT WEARING ANY PROTECTIVE GEAR.\nWHATEVER THEY HAVE DONE SUGGESTS THAT THEY DO NOT NEED TO BE\nWEARING SOME SORT OF PROTECTIVE GEAR.\nTHEY ARE BRINGING IN THAT SECOND TRUCK.\nWE CAN'T QUITE TELL -- THEY'RE OPENING THE BACK.\nWE CAN'T TELL WHAT THEY'RE DOING.\nTHAT CAR IS OF DEFINITE INTEREST, POPPY.\n>> THANK YOU. STAY WITH ME.\nWHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS? A LOT OF DETAILS WE DON'T KNOW.\nDEB MADE AN IMPORTANT POINT. THEY ARE LETTING HER STAY CLOSE\nTO THIS AND THEY'RE NOT WEARING ANY PROTECTIVE GEAR, THE\nINVESTIGATORS. >> FRANKLY, ANY CAR WITH A NEW\nJERSEY PLATE ON IT IN THE PROXIMITY OF THIS INCIDENT IN\nLIGHT OF WHAT HAPPENED IN NEW JERSEY EARLIER IN THE DAY WOULD\nBE CAUSE FOR THIS TYPE OF LOOK. THEY WOULD BE EVACUATING THE\nAREA AS IMMEDIATE FIRST", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1474240849859.1474236974500.80242861-e283-4743-908f-73b36200f533.segment4.thumb.jpg", "channel": "202"}, {"start": 189958.0, "length": 391048.0, "end": 581006, "date": 1474239498126, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1474242823840.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1474238782182-ad719a7c-86f3-42df-a83c-570a7ce06eda-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=189.96,581.01", "text": ">>> YOU'RE LOOKING AT LIVE\nPICTURES OF INVESTIGATORS LOOKING AT A SUBARU SURROUNDED\nBY TAPE THERE.

THE STATIONED MARKED POLICE CAR\nRIGHT NEXT TO IT. THIS IS CLEARLY SOMETHING THAT\nMIGHT HAVE SOME INFORMATION. THEY ARE CURIOUS ABOUT AND THE\nFACT IT HAS NEW JERSEY PLAITS.

NOW, THE MAN WAS ROLLING A BLACK\nDUFFEL BAG. HE IS SEEN AT THE DUMPSTER ON\nWEST 23rd STREET. HE THEN MAKES HIS WAY NORTH UP\nTO 27th STREET, FOUR BLOCKS, LEAVES THE DUFFEL BAG AND THEN\nWALKS AWAY.

DAN SPRINGER IS LIVE FROM THE\nWEST COAST BUREAU WITH THE LATEST.\nDAN? >> ISIS RELATED MEDIA CLAIMING\nRESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK EARLY THIS MORNING.\nTHE SOURCE HAS BEEN CREDIBLE IN THE PAST.\nWHAT'S UNCLEAR IF THERE WAS ANY CONTACT WITH THE ISLAMIC STATE\nOR IF IT WAS JUSTIN SPIRED BY ISIS.\nTHE FBI WON'T GO THAT FAR YET, SAYING ONLY THAT THIS IS -- THE\nJOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCE IS DOING THE INVESTIGATION WITH ST.\nCLOUD POLICE AND WON'T GIVE THE SUSPECT'S CAR IN THE PARKING LOT\nAND SEARCHED TWO APARTMENTS CONNECTED TO HIM.\nWE KNOW HE WAS DRESSED LIKE -- ARMED WITH A KNIFE AND HE PULLED\nTHE KNIFE OUT AND STARTED STABBING PEOPLE AND ASKED\nANOTHER IF HE WAS A MUSLIM. WITNESSES ALSO TOLD POLICE THE\nATTACKER SAID SOMETHING ABOUT ALLAH.\nTHE MAN LIVED IN ST. CLOUD BUT ONLY HAD A FEW MINOR CONTACTS\nWITH POLICE. NOW HIS ENTIRE BACKGROUND IS\nBEING LOOKED AT. >> WE'RE CURRENTLY INVESTIGATING\nTHIS AS A POTENTIAL ACT OF TERRORISM.\nI DO SAY POTENTIAL. THERE'S A LOT WE DON'T KNOW.\nWE DO NOT AT THIS POINT IN TIME KNOW WHETHER THE SUBJECT WAS IN\nCONTACT WITH HAD CONNECTIONS WITH, WAS INSPIRED BY, A FOREIGN\nTERRORIST ORGANIZATION. >> THE SUSPECT'S STABBED NINE\nPEOPLE BEFORE AN OFFDUTY POLICE OFFICER SHOT AND KILLED HIM\nABOUT FIVE MINUTES AFTER THE FIRST 911 CALL CAME IN.\nSEVEN MEN AND TWO WOMEN WERE INJURED AND THREE REMAIN IN THE\nHOSPITAL WITH NONCRITICAL INJURIES.\nTHAT OFFICER IS BEING HAILED AS A HERO TODAY AND SAVED LIVES AS\nTHE ATTACKER LOUNGED AT HIM THREE TIMES.\n>> NOT FOR HIS ACTIONS THINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN WORSE.\nI HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO HIM A HALF HOUR AGO AND CLEARLY\nPREVENTED ADDITIONAL INJURIES AND POTENTIALLY LOSS OF LIFE\nTHROUGH HIS HEROIC ACTIONS. >> POLICE WON'T RELEASE THE\nSUSPECT'S IDENTITY. WE CAN TELL YOU NEARBY\nMINNEAPOLIS HAS BEEN THE CENTER OF RECENT TERROR INVESTIGATIONS\nLOOKING AT THE LARGE MUSLIM SOMALI COMMUNITY A FEW MONTHS\nAGO THREE MEN WERE CONVICTED OF TERROR RELATED CHARGES AND THE\nINVESTIGATION THAT NINE CONVICTIONS AND FED SAYING ISIS\nHAS DONE A LOT OF RECRUITING IN THE MINNEAPOLIS AREA.\nIT REMAINS TO BE SEEN IF THE KNIFE ATTACK HAS ANY CONNECTION.\nARTHEL. >> THANKS, DAN.\n>> THREE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON THE SAME DAY.\nTWO NOW BELIEVED TO BE CONNECTED -- IN NEW JERSEY, THE\nSTREET BOMB MAY HAVE A TIE AND ALLEGED RADICAL ISLAMIC\nTERRORIST SPREE IN MINNESOTA. WHAT ARE THE SIMILARITIES AND\nWHAT ARE INVESTIGATORS FOCUSED ON?\nTED WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR JOINS US NOW.\nTED, LET ME START WITH THE BOMBINGS IN NEW YORK AND NEW\nJERSEY, THEY BELIEVE THEY ARE FROM THE SAME PERSON.\nDOES THAT NOW GIVE US A REALLY POTENTIAL MOTIVE CONSIDERING THE\nFACT THAT THE BOMBS IN THE MORNING AT 9:30 IN THE MORNING\nTARGETED A CHARITY RUN BENEFITTING OUR MARINES AND\nMARINES FAMILY? YOU MAY START WITH AN ANTI-U.S.\nMILITARY MOTIVE THAT SOMEHOW WAS TRANSPOSED LATER ON IN THE\nEVENING TO NEW YORK CITY? >> ABSOLUTELY, IT'S A MOTIVE\nHERE. THAT IS THAT THERE ARE\nINDIVIDUALS OUT THERE THAT WANT TO HARM AND KILL US.\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NEW JERSEY BOMBING, I THINK WHAT TIED THE\nNEW JERSEY BOMBING TO THE NEW YORK BOMBING IS THE BLACK POWDER\nTHAT THEY FOUND IN THE PIPE BOMB OR IN THE PIPE BOMB IN NEW\nJERSEY. WHAT WE HAVE ARE WITNESSES WHO\nSAY THAT WHEN A 23rd STREET BOMB WENT OFF, THEY SAW A PLUME OF\nWHITE SMOKE. AND THE NEXUS IS WITH THE CELL\nPHONES, THEY FOUND THE CELL PHONE IN NEW JERSEY AND ALSO\nFOUND A CELL PHONE AT 23rd STREET AND WITH THE PRESSURE\nCOOKER THAT WAS INTACT ON 27th STREET.\n>> SO BASICALLY, THE INVESTIGATORS RIGHT NOW HAVE A\nLOT OF EVIDENCE, NOT JUST THE CELL PHONE TYPE, BUT THEY'VE GOT\nTHE WIRES AND HAVE POTENTIAL POWDER AND REMNANTS OF BOTH\nBOMBS AND HAVE DEVICES IN NEW JERSEY THAT DIDN'T EVEN EXPLODE\nLIKE THE PRESSURE COOKER. >> YOU KNOW, BEST THING THAT\nHAPPENED IN THIS WAS TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT 27th STREET BOMB\nINTACT. BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF\nFORENSICS THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET PERHAPS FROM THAT\nINTACT BOMB. ALSO WHAT'S GOING TO BE VERY\nSIGNIFICANT IN THIS, ERIC, THOSE VIDEOS AND VIDEOS IN THAT AREA,\nNOT SO MUCH IN NEW JERSEY WHERE YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE BUT IN THE\nCRAMPED AREA THERE IN THE CHELSEA AREA OF NEW YORK, THEY\nARE NOTHING BUT VIDEO CAMERAS AND I THINK THAT'S GOING TO HELP\nLAW ENFORCEMENT SIGNIFICANTLY. >> ALSO SOMETHING IN COMMON WITH\nTHE TSARNAEV BROTHERS, FROM THE BOSTON MARATHON, THEY HAD OTHER\nEXPLOSIVE DEVICES IN THE CAR DURING THE CHASE, THROWING THEM\nOUT THE BACK OF THE CAR. THEY HAD SOME PIPE BOMBS.\nLET'S SAY THIS PERSON TOOK A PAGE FROM THEM OR FROM INSPIRE\nAND THE AL QAEDA MAGAZINE FOR A PRESSURE COOKER AND PIPE BOMB.\nLET ME SHOW YOU A MAP OF THE STATION, HE PLANTS THOSE BOMBS,\nPOTENTIALLY COULD THEY TAKE THE PATH TRAIN FROM HOBOKEN AND\nJERSEY CITY AND GET OFF ON THAT BLOCK LAST NIGHT AND THEN JUST\nWALK ALONG AND DUMP ONE BOMB IN A DUMPSTER AND MAKE A LEFT, WALK\nFOUR BLOCKS NORTH AND DUMP ANOTHER BOMB IN THE GARBAGE CAN.\nJERSEY CITY HAS BEEN THE SITE OF THE TERRORIST SELL THAT THEY\nWENT ON TO BOMB THE WORLD TRADE CENTER.\nIS THERE A POTENTIAL CONNECTION THERE BECAUSE OF THE TIME LINE\nAND THE NEW JERSEY PATH, YOU COULD DRIVE BUT THAT NEW JERSEY\nNEW YORK CONNECTION BECAUSE OF 12 HOURS PLUS TIME DIFFERENCE?\n>> ABSOLUTELY, ERIC, VERY WELL PUT TOGETHER THERE THAT MAP.\nI CAN TELL YOU THAT THAT IS CERTAINLY IN THE MINDS OF LAW\nENFORCEMENT, HOW A PERSON GOT FROM NEW JERSEY TO NEW YORK IN\nORDER TO DISPOSE THESE VARIOUS BOMBS.\nONE OF THE THINGS THAT I DON'T THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT\nENOUGH, WAS THIS SOME KIND OF A TRIAL RUN TO SEE HOW AUTHORITIES\nWOULD REACT? I DON'T WANT TO FRIGHTEN\nANYBODY, BUT WE CERTAINLY NEED TO -- IF WE SEE SOMETHING, SAY\nSOMETHING, BECAUSE THIS CLEARLY MAY HAVE BEEN JUST A TRIAL RUN,\nERIC. >> THAT'S A CHILLING PROSPECT,\nSOMETHING WE'VE ALWAYS LEARNED ABOUT AND HAVE HAD THOSE\nWARNINGS AND WE'LL HEED THEM CERTAINLY IN THE WAKE OF WHAT WE\nWENT THROUGH IN THE CITY OVER THE WEEKEND.\nTED WILLIAMS, THANKS YOU AS ALWAYS FOR YOUR INSIGHT.\n>> MY PLEASURE. >> LIFE IS RETURNING TO NORMAL\nIN A NEW YORK CITY NEIGHBORHOOD AS THE INVESTIGATION UNFOLDS\nINTO THE BLAST ALONG A VERY BUSY STREET.\nHEAR WHAT AUTHORITIES ARE DOING TO TRACK DOWN THOSE RESPONSIBLE,\nPLUS DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON SPEAKING OUT ABOUT THE\nBLAST. SO HOW SOON IS TOO SOON FOR A\nCANDIDATE WITH LIMITED FACTS TO WEIGH IN?\nWE'LL DISCUSS.      REMEMBER HERE AT ALLY,   NOTHING STOPS US FROM DOING\n  RIGHT BY OUR CUSTOMERS.

WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE\nALL OF THE FACTION. WE KNOW THERE WAS A BOMBING.\nTHAT MUCH WE DO KNOW. WE KNOW IT WAS A VERY SERIOUS\nINCIDENT. >> AND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE\nHUDSON RIVER IN SEASIDE HEIGHTS, NEW JERSEY, GETTING BACK TO\nNORMAL TODAY. BEACHES HAVE REOPENED IN THE NEW\nJERSEY SHORE TOWN THAT WERE CLOSED AFTER THE EXPLOSION\nYESTERDAY. IT WAS PUT ON LOCKDOWN AND\nSEVERAL HOMES HAD BEEN EVACUATED FOLLOWING THAT ATTACK.\nBLAST COMING BEFORE THE START OF THE 5K RACE BENEFITTING MARINES\nTHAT WAS SET TO START BUT DELAYED, THAT'S WHY NO ONE WAS\nHURT. A PIPE BOMB DID GO OFF IN A\nPLASTIC GARBAGE CAN AND THEY DID RECOVER SEVERAL OTHER DEVICES.\nLET'S START IN NEW YORK CITY WHERE BRYAN HAS THE VERY LATEST.\nHI, BRYAN. >> Reporter: GOOD AFTERNOON,\nTHAT IS A BIG, BIG DEVELOPMENT YOU JUST REPORTED, OUR RICK\nLEVENTHAL HEARING THAT THE DEVICES THAT WENT OFF IN\nSEAEDSIDE PART YESTERDAY MORNING IS CONNECTED TO THE EXPLOSIVE\nDEVICES PUT HERE, THE ONE THAT WENT OFF LAST NIGHT ON 23rd\nBETWEEN 6th AND 7th AND THE DEVICE THAT WAS FOUND FOUR\nBLOCKS NORTH ON 27th BETWEEN 6th AND 7th.\nWHAT WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND, WE KNOW THEY ARE LOOKING AT ONE OF\nTHE DEVICES THAT THE SUSPICIOUS DEVICE THAT FOUND, THAT PRESSURE\nCOOKER DEVICE AT THE ARTILLERY RANGE, THEY ARE LOOKING INTO\nTHAT. TO WHAT EXTENT ARE ALL THREE\nDEVICES ALIKE? WERE THEY ALL THREE PRESSURE\nCOOKER TYPE DEVICES? WE DON'T KNOW.\nWE WERE INITIALLY TOLD THE INITIAL DEVICE IN SEASIDE PARK\nWAS A PIPE BOMB AND ALSO BY THE OCEAN COUNTY PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE\nTHAT THAT DEVICE WAS CONNECTED TO TWO OTHER DEVICES IN THE\nGARBAGE CAN THAT COULD HAVE GONE OFF AND MADE THE BLAST LARGER\nTHAN IT WAS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO ACTIVE\nCRIME SCENES HERE IN MANHATTAN AND CHELSEA NEIGHBORHOOD\nCONNECTED TO A THIRD CRIME SCENE FROM YESTERDAY'S BLAST IN\nSEASIDE PARK NEW JERSEY AT 9:30 A.M.\nTHAT BLAST WENT OFF AT 9:35 ABOUT, THAT RACE WAS DELAYED IN\nITS START BECAUSE OF LONG REGISTRATION LINES AND IT WAS A\n5K CHARITY RACE FOR MARINES, U.S. MARINES, THOUSANDS OF THEM\nWHO TRAVELED FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND TAKING PART IN THAT\nCHARITY RUN AND THE REASON WHY THEY WERE NOT RUNNING PAST THAT\nGARBAGE CAN WAS BECAUSE THAT RACE STARTED LATE BECAUSE OF\nTHOSE REGISTRATION LINES. HERE IN NEW YORK CITY, THE CRIME\nSCENE IS ACTIVE AND THEY ARE CONTINUING TO LOOK FOR\nSURVEILLANCE VIDEO TO GATHER EVIDENCE FROM THE RESIDENCES\nHERE. WE'RE TOLD THAT SHOULD LAST A\nCOUPLE MORE HOURS TODAY. WHILE THE SECOND DEVICE IS BEING\nLOOKED AT IN THE BRONX. MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO CALLING\nTHIS AN INTENTIONAL ACT, NOT YET JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS ABOUT\nMOTIVATIONS, LISTEN TO WHAT ANDREW CUOMO SAID EARLIER TODAY\nABOUT THE POTENTIAL OF THIS BEING AN ATTACK.\n>> IT DEPENDS ON YOUR DEFINITION OF TERRORISM.\nA BOMB EXPLODING IN NEW YORK IS OBVIOUSLY AN ACT OF TERRORISM.\nBUT IT'S NOT LINKED TO INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.\nIN OTHER WORDS, WE FIND NO ISIS CONNECTION, ET CETERA.\n>> Reporter: GOVERNOR ANDREW CUOMO SAYS NEW YORKER SHOULD GO\nABOUT THEIR DAILY LIVES BUT SECURITY LIKE WE'VE NEVER SEEN\nBEFORE. MORE THAN 1,000 ADDITIONAL\nOFFICERS AND GUARDS OUT AS A PRECAUTION.\n>> BRYAN, VERY, VERY FORTUNATE THAT IN BOTH INCIDENTS, NO ONE\nWAS KILLED OF COURSE. THANKS SO MUCH.\n>> INDEED, ERIC. ISIS IS NOW CLAIMING\nRESPONSIBILITY FOR A KNIFE ATTACK AT A MINNESOTA MALL THAT\nLEFT NINE PEOPLE INJURED. ISIS PROPAGANDA TODAY CLAIMING\nTHAT THE SUSPECT WAS A QUOTE, SOLDIER OF THE ISLAMIC 125I6789\nTHE ATTACKER WHO WAS ASKING ONE VICTIM IF THEY WERE MUSLIM, WENT\nON A BLOODY STABBING RAMPAGE AT THE CROSS ROADS MALL IN ST.\nCLOUD BEFORE HE WAS SHOT AND KILLED BY AN OFFDUTY POLICE\nOFFICER. DAN SPRINGER IS LIVE FROM THE\nWEST COAST BUREAU WITH THE LATEST.\nDAN? >> ISIS RELATED MEDIA CLAIMING\nRESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK EARLY THIS MORNING.\nTHE SOURCE HAS BEEN CREDIBLE IN THE PAST.\nWHAT'S UNCLEAR IF THERE WAS ANY CONTACT WITH THE ISLAMIC STATE\nOR IF IT WAS JUSTIN SPIRED BY ISIS.\nTHE FBI WON'T GO THAT FAR YET, SAYING ONLY THAT THIS IS -- THE\nJOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCE IS DOING THE INVESTIGATION WITH ST.\nCLOUD POLICE AND WON'T GIVE THE SUSPECT'S CAR IN THE PARKING LOT\nAND SEARCHED TWO APARTMENTS CONNECTED TO HIM.\nWE KNOW HE WAS DRESSED LIKE -- ARMED WITH A KNIFE AND HE PULLED\nTHE KNIFE OUT AND STARTED STABBING PEOPLE AND ASKED\nANOTHER IF HE WAS A MUSLIM. WITNESSES ALSO TOLD POLICE THE\nATTACKER SAID SOMETHING ABOUT ALLAH.\nTHE MAN LIVED IN ST. CLOUD BUT ONLY HAD A FEW MINOR CONTACTS\nWITH POLICE. NOW HIS ENTIRE BACKGROUND IS\nBEING LOOKED AT. >> WE'RE CURRENTLY INVESTIGATING\nTHIS AS A POTENTIAL ACT OF TERRORISM.\nI DO SAY POTENTIAL. THERE'S A LOT WE DON'T KNOW.\nWE DO NOT AT THIS POINT IN TIME KNOW WHETHER THE SUBJECT WAS IN\nCONTACT WITH HAD CONNECTIONS WITH, WAS INSPIRED BY, A FOREIGN\nTERRORIST ORGANIZATION. >> THE SUSPECT'S STABBED NINE\nPEOPLE BEFORE AN OFFDUTY POLICE OFFICER SHOT AND KILLED HIM\nABOUT FIVE MINUTES AFTER THE FIRST 911 CALL CAME IN.\nSEVEN MEN AND TWO WOMEN WERE INJURED AND THREE REMAIN IN THE\nHOSPITAL WITH NONCRITICAL INJURIES.\nTHAT OFFICER IS BEING HAILED AS A HERO TODAY AND SAVED LIVES AS\nTHE ATTACKER LOUNGED AT HIM THREE TIMES.\n>> NOT FOR HIS ACTIONS THINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN WORSE.\nI HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO HIM A HALF HOUR AGO AND CLEARLY\nPREVENTED ADDITIONAL INJURIES AND POTENTIALLY LOSS OF LIFE\nTHROUGH HIS HEROIC ACTIONS. >> POLICE WON'T RELEASE THE\nSUSPECT'S IDENTITY. WE CAN TELL YOU NEARBY\nMINNEAPOLIS HAS BEEN THE CENTER OF RECENT TERROR INVESTIGATIONS\nLOOKING AT THE LARGE MUSLIM SOMALI COMMUNITY A FEW MONTHS\nAGO THREE MEN WERE CONVICTED OF TERROR RELATED CHARGES AND THE\nINVESTIGATION THAT NINE CONVICTIONS AND FED SAYING ISIS\nHAS DONE A LOT OF RECRUITING IN THE MINNEAPOLIS AREA.\nIT REMAINS TO BE SEEN IF THE KNIFE ATTACK HAS ANY CONNECTION.\nARTHEL. >> THANKS, DAN.\n>> THREE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON THE SAME DAY.\nTWO NOW BELIEVED TO BE CONNECTED -- IN NEW JERSEY, THE\nSTREET BOMB MAY HAVE A TIE AND ALLEGED RADICAL ISLAMIC\nTERRORIST SPREE IN MINNESOTA. WHAT ARE THE SIMILARITIES AND\nWHAT ARE INVESTIGATORS FOCUSED ON?\nTED WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR JOINS US NOW.\nTED, LET ME START WITH THE BOMBINGS IN NEW YORK AND NEW\nJERSEY, THEY BELIEVE THEY ARE FROM THE SAME PERSON.\nDOES THAT NOW GIVE US A REALLY POTENTIAL MOTIVE CONSIDERING THE\nFACT THAT THE BOMBS IN THE MORNING AT 9:30 IN THE MORNING\nTARGETED A CHARITY RUN BENEFITTING OUR MARINES AND\nMARINES FAMILY? YOU MAY START WITH AN ANTI-U.S.\nMILITARY MOTIVE THAT SOMEHOW WAS TRANSPOSED LATER ON IN THE\nEVENING TO NEW YORK CITY? >> ABSOLUTELY, IT'S A MOTIVE\nHERE. THAT IS THAT THERE ARE\nINDIVIDUALS OUT THERE THAT WANT TO HARM AND KILL US.\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NEW JERSEY BOMBING, I THINK WHAT TIED THE\nNEW JERSEY BOMBING TO THE NEW YORK BOMBING IS THE BLACK POWDER\nTHAT THEY FOUND IN THE PIPE BOMB OR IN THE PIPE BOMB IN NEW\nJERSEY. WHAT WE HAVE ARE WITNESSES WHO\nSAY THAT WHEN A 23rd STREET BOMB WENT OFF, THEY SAW A PLUME OF\nWHITE SMOKE. AND THE NEXUS IS WITH THE CELL\nPHONES, THEY FOUND THE CELL PHONE IN NEW JERSEY AND ALSO\nFOUND A CELL PHONE AT 23rd STREET AND WITH THE PRESSURE\nCOOKER THAT WAS INTACT ON 27th STREET.\n>> SO BASICALLY, THE INVESTIGATORS RIGHT NOW HAVE A\nLOT OF EVIDENCE, NOT JUST THE CELL PHONE TYPE, BUT THEY'VE GOT\nTHE WIRES AND HAVE POTENTIAL POWDER AND REMNANTS OF BOTH\nBOMBS AND HAVE DEVICES IN NEW JERSEY THAT DIDN'T EVEN EXPLODE\nLIKE THE PRESSURE COOKER. >> YOU KNOW, BEST THING THAT\nHAPPENED IN THIS WAS TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT 27th STREET BOMB\nINTACT. BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF\nFORENSICS THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET PERHAPS FROM THAT\nINTACT BOMB. ALSO WHAT'S GOING TO BE VERY\nSIGNIFICANT IN THIS, ERIC, THOSE VIDEOS AND VIDEOS IN THAT AREA,\nNOT SO MUCH IN NEW JERSEY WHERE YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE BUT IN THE\nCRAMPED AREA THERE IN THE CHELSEA AREA OF NEW YORK, THEY\nARE NOTHING BUT VIDEO CAMERAS AND I THINK THAT'S GOING TO HELP\nLAW ENFORCEMENT SIGNIFICANTLY. >> ALSO SOMETHING IN COMMON WITH\nTHE TSARNAEV BROTHERS, FROM THE BOSTON MARATHON, THEY HAD OTHER\nEXPLOSIVE DEVICES IN THE CAR DURING THE CHASE, THROWING THEM\nOUT THE BACK OF THE CAR. THEY HAD SOME PIPE BOMBS.\nLET'S SAY THIS PERSON TOOK A PAGE FROM THEM OR FROM INSPIRE\nAND THE AL QAEDA MAGAZINE FOR A PRESSURE COOKER AND PIPE BOMB.\nLET ME SHOW YOU A MAP OF THE STATION, HE PLANTS THOSE BOMBS,\nPOTENTIALLY COULD THEY TAKE THE PATH TRAIN FROM HOBOKEN AND\nJERSEY CITY AND GET OFF ON THAT BLOCK LAST NIGHT AND THEN JUST\nWALK ALONG AND DUMP ONE BOMB IN A DUMPSTER AND MAKE A LEFT, WALK\nFOUR BLOCKS NORTH AND DUMP ANOTHER BOMB IN THE GARBAGE CAN.\nJERSEY CITY HAS BEEN THE SITE OF THE TERRORIST SELL THAT THEY\nWENT ON TO BOMB THE WORLD TRADE CENTER.\nIS THERE A POTENTIAL CONNECTION THERE BECAUSE OF THE TIME LINE\nAND THE NEW JERSEY PATH, YOU COULD DRIVE BUT THAT NEW JERSEY\nNEW YORK CONNECTION BECAUSE OF 12 HOURS PLUS TIME DIFFERENCE?\n>> ABSOLUTELY, ERIC, VERY WELL PUT TOGETHER THERE THAT MAP.\nI CAN TELL YOU THAT THAT IS CERTAINLY IN THE MINDS OF LAW\nENFORCEMENT, HOW A PERSON GOT FROM NEW JERSEY TO NEW YORK IN\nORDER TO DISPOSE THESE VARIOUS BOMBS.\nONE OF THE THINGS THAT I DON'T THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT\nENOUGH, WAS THIS SOME KIND OF A TRIAL RUN TO SEE HOW AUTHORITIES\nWOULD REACT? I DON'T WANT TO FRIGHTEN\nANYBODY, BUT WE CERTAINLY NEED TO -- IF WE SEE SOMETHING, SAY\nSOMETHING, BECAUSE THIS CLEARLY MAY HAVE BEEN JUST A TRIAL RUN,\nERIC. >> THAT'S A CHILLING PROSPECT,\nSOMETHING WE'VE ALWAYS LEARNED ABOUT AND HAVE HAD THOSE\nWARNINGS AND WE'LL HEED THEM CERTAINLY IN THE WAKE OF WHAT WE\nWENT THROUGH IN THE CITY OVER THE WEEKEND.\nTED WILLIAMS, THANKS YOU AS ALWAYS FOR YOUR INSIGHT.\n>> MY PLEASURE. >> LIFE IS RETURNING TO NORMAL\nIN A NEW YORK CITY NEIGHBORHOOD AS THE INVESTIGATION UNFOLDS\nINTO THE BLAST ALONG A VERY BUSY STREET.\nHEAR WHAT AUTHORITIES ARE DOING TO TRACK DOWN THOSE RESPONSIBLE,\nPLUS DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON SPEAKING OUT ABOUT THE\nBLAST. SO HOW SOON IS TOO SOON FOR A\nCANDIDATE WITH LIMITED FACTS TO WEIGH IN?\nWE'LL DISCUSS.      REMEMBER HERE AT ALLY,   NOTHING STOPS US FROM DOING\n  RIGHT BY OUR CUSTOMERS.          WHO'S WITH ME?               I'M IN.\n  I'M IN.\n                         I'M IN.

THE CHOICE OF BOMB, THE CHOICE\nOF MATERIAL, THE CHOICE OF DETONATION?\nWHY NOT NOW, WHY NOW THEN AND WHY WHERE IT WAS HIT?\n>> THE WHY IS BECAUSE JIHAD IS COMMANDED.\nSO THEY ARE DOING WHAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO DO ACCORDING TO\nRADICAL ISLAM.

LOOK NO FURTHER THAN THE CELL\nPHONE ON TOP, WHERE WAS THAT CELL PHONE PURCHASED.\nWHAT PROVIDER WAS IT? WAS IT -- WAS THERE A CALL TO\nTEST THAT DEVICE, AND THAT CALL GOES RIGHT BACK TO THE PERSON\nWE'RE LOOKING FOR RIGHT NOW. THIS LITTLE DEVICE HERE CAN TELL\nUS A LOT ABOUT A PERSON, ABOUT THEIR NETWORK, ABOUT THEIR\nTACTICS. SO I DON'T THINK THEY INTENDED\nTHAT SECOND ONE NOT TO DETONATE. >> NOT TO WORK.\n>> LET ME ASK YOU THIS, RON, BECAUSE THEY DID PUT APPARENTLY\nIN THE SECOND ONE THEY FOUND BALL BEARINGS AND BBs TO INFLICT\nTHE MAXIMUM SHRAPNEL DAMAGE TO PEOPLE.\nWHY WOULD THEY PUT IT INSIDE A DUMPSTER?\n>> WELL, GOOD QUESTION. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE\nOUT OR LEARN FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT WHY THE ANSWERS.\nMAYBE THEY BELIEVED IT WAS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO CREATE\nADDITIONAL SHRAPNEL FROM THE DUMPSTER EXPLODING AND THAT'S\nGOING TO HAVE THAT EFFECT TOO. YOU SEE WHERE SOME OF THE\nSHRAPNEL PENETRATED THIS DUMPSTER.\nTHE FIRST ONE. >> PEOPLE SAY TOO, EXPERTS IN\nBOMBING I SAYING ONE OF THE BIG DIFFERENCE IS THE DETONATION.\nTHEY DID FLIP PHONES. THE OTHER ONES USED REMOTE\nCONTROL FROM -- BASICALLY REMOTE CONTROLLED CAR.\nTHE OTHER IS THE MATERIAL USED. THE IDIOTS FROM THE BOSTON\nBOMBING USED BLACK POWDER.

THE EQUALITY PRINCIPLE.\nDONALD TRUMP FOR FIVE YEARS WAS PUSHING THE COMPLETELY FALSE\nNOTION THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA WASN'T BORN IN THE UNITED STATES\nAND WASN'T AN AMERICAN CITIZEN, AND CHUCK IT IS IMPORTANT TO\nKNOW HOW PAINFUL THAT IS TO SO MANY PEOPLE, BECAUSE AS YOU\nKNOW, FROM THE TIME THAT AFRICAN-AMERICANS CAME HERE TO\nJAMESTOWN IN 1619 THROUGH THE DRED SCOTT DECISION IN THE\n1850s, IF YOU WERE AFRICAN-AMERICAN IN THIS\nCOUNTRY, YOU COULD NOT BE A CITIZEN WHETHER YOU WERE SLAVE\nOR FREE OR BORN HERE OR ELSEWHERE, AND YOU COULD NOT BE\nA CITIZEN. AND WE HAD TO FIGHT A CIVIL WAR\nAND CHANGE THE CONSTITUTION TO CHANGE THAT, AND SO WHEN DONALD\nTRUMP FOR FIVE YEARS HAS BEEN PROMOTING THE NOTION THAT AN\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT IS NOT A CITIZEN, THAT IS EXTREMELY\nPOWERFUL AND PAINFUL TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND OOTHERS\nWHO KNOW THIS PAINFUL CHAPTER IN AMERICAN HISTORY.\n>> WHY IS THIS ELECTION SO CLOSE, AND WHY IN THE SUDDEN IN\nTHE LAST THREE WEEKS THE ELECTION HAS GONE WHERE YOU GUYS\nHAD A DURABLE LEAD AND WE CAN DEBATE THE MARGIN OF IT TO NOW\nWHERE HE HAS A VIABLE PATH TO THE PRESIDENCY THAT FRANKLY\nDIDN'T SEEM TO EXIST. HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?\nIF EVERYTHING THAT YOU ARE SAYING IS TRUE, HOW DID THIS\nHAPPEN? >> I U THINK IT IS BECAUSE WE\nARE A CLOSE NATION.

THREE PARTICULAR CLUMPS OF THOSE\nSTATES, THERE'S ONE IN THE MIDWEST MOST PROMISING FOR\nDONALD TRUMP, PENNSYLVANIA, OHIO, IOWA, MICHIGAN, WISCONSIN.\nTHEN THERE'S A CHUNK IN THE SOUTHEAST, VIRGINIA, NORTH\nCAROLINA AND FLORIDA. AND YOU GOT THREE OUT WEST WHERE\nTHE LATINO VOTE'S GOING TO COME IN PLAY IN A VERY BIG WAY,\nARIZONA, NEVADA AND COLORADO. THOSE ARE WHERE THE CANDIDATES\nARE GOING TO INVEST THEIR MONEY, INVEST THEIR TIME, THEIR\nSTRATEGIC RESOURCES IN TERMS OF VOTER TURNOUT AND VOTER\nTARGETING AND IDENTIFICATION. THAT'S WHERE THE THING'S GOING\nTO BE DECIDED 50 DAYS FROM NOW WE'LL KNOW THE ANSWER, GUYS.\n>> JOHN, THANK YOU FOR THAT. AND FOR MORE ON THIS LET'S BRING\nIN FROM WASHINGTON FORMER CRUZ CAMPAIGN SPOKESMAN RICK TYLER\nAND POLITICO ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENT AND CNBC\nCONTRIBUTOR BEN WHITE. GENTLEMEN, GOOD MORNING TO YOU\nBOTH. >> GOOD MORNING.\n>> BEN, ONCE AGAIN WE'RE SORT OF LEFT WITH THE PUZZLE OF WHY THE\nMARKET IS, I WOULDN'T SAY RALLYING, BUT AT LEAST GREEN IN\nTHE FACE OF AN EVENT LIKE WHAT WE SAW OVER THE WEEKEND.\nWHY IS THAT? >> WELL, I WOULD THINK THAT, YOU\nKNOW, THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A CONCERN THAT YOU HAVE AFTER AN\nEVENT LIKE THIS PEOPLE ARE NERVOUS.\nBUT THERE HASN'T BEEN TREMENDOUS DAMAGE FROM IT.\nWE SEEM TO HAVE A TARGET IN MIND, A PERSON WHO IT LOOKS LIKE\nIS BEHIND THESE ATTACKS. AND MY GUESS IS MARKETS ARE\nANTICIPATING THE FED THIS WEEK. THE FED STAYING ON HOLD, NOT\nRAISING INTEREST RATES, THAT'S OBVIOUSLY GOOD FOR MARKETS.\nTHIS IS A DISTURBING EVENT BUT NOT ONE THAT WOULD SHAKE\nMARKETS. THAT'S WHAT WE'VE SEEN SO FAR.\n>> THEN OF COURSE WE HAD THE SECRETARY SPEAK A FEW MOMENTS\nAGO, RICK, IN WHICH SHE RELIES ON AN ARGUMENT BASED ON HER\nEXPERIENCE. I KNOW HOW TO DO THIS.\nI WAS IN THE SITUATION ROOM. OF COURSE THE NATURAL RESPONSE\nIS, WELL, WHAT DO WE HAVE TO SHOW FOR IT AFTER THIS WEEKEND,\nRIGHT? >> YEAH, I THINK THAT'S THE\nCENTRAL ARGUMENT. I WATCHED HER PRESS CONFERENCE\nAND SHE COMPETENTLY DELIVERED A CONFIDENT AND CONFIDENCE MESSAGE\nTHAT IN THESE SITUATIONS SHE'S BEEN THERE BEFORE, SHE'S BEEN IN\nTHE SITUATION ROOM, SHE'S CONTRIBUTED TO DECISION MAKING\nTHAT HAS LED TO THE DEFEAT OF TERRORISM.\nBUT AT THE SAME TIME ISIS REALLY WAS AN OUTGROWTH OF THE ONE\nWOULD ARGUE THE OBAMA/CLINTON FOREIGN POLICY.\nIT DID NOT EXIST BEFORE HILLARY CLINTON WAS SECRETARY OF STATE.\nTHAT'S NOT TO SAY SHE'S ENTIRELY RESPONSIBLE FOR IT, BUT THE\nMIDDLE EAST WHERE TERRORISM HAS EXISTED SHE CERTAINLY WAS AT THE\nHEAD -- SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE DURING THAT TIME.\nI DO THINK THAT SHE DID FOCUS ON RIGHTLY AND HAS NOT BEEN ENOUGH\nIS TO COUNTER THESE PERSUASIVE ONLINE SOCIAL MEDIA NETWORKING\nTHAT ISIS USES VERY EFFECTIVELY. EFFECTIVELY MEDIA COMPANIES\nRECRUITING AND PERSUADING PEOPLE WHO LIKE PERHAPS RAHAMI WILL\nFIND OUT WHETHER THEY WERE PERSUADED BY THOSE KINDS OF\nVIDEOS AND BECAME RADICALIZED HERE IN THE UNITED STATES.\n>> YEAH, THAT INTELLIGENCE SURGE THAT SHE TALKED ABOUT.\nBEN, WE DO HAVE THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE UNITED NATIONS\nHERE IN NEW YORK. IT'S A REMINDER THAT THE U.S.\nRELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER WORLD LEADERS MATTER.\nWHO SHOULD SECRETARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP BE FOCUSED ON WHEN\nIT COMES TO THE FIGHT ON TERROR, WHICH IS NOW FRONT AND CENTER?\n>> RIGHT, WELL, CERTAINLY OUR ALLIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST YOU'LL\nSEE BOTH OF THESE CANDIDATES MEETING WITH THE EGYPTIAN\nLEADERS. AND IT'S, YOU KNOW, ALSO ACROSS\nEUROPE THERE'S REALLY NO ONE AMONG THESE WORLD LEADERS AT THE\nU.N. WHO WOULD NOT BE BENEFICIAL FOR THESE PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATES TO MEET WITH TO TALK ABOUT OUR EFFORTS TO FIGHT\nTERRORISM BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND ABROAD.\nBUT IT'S REALLY CRITICAL FOR THEM TO ESTABLISH RELATIONS WITH\nOTHER MIDDLE EASTERN LEADERS WHO ARE OUR PARTNERS IN THE WAR ON\nTERROR AND TRYING TO STOP THESE TYPES OF EVENTS IN THE UNITED\nSTATES. BUT I THINK WHAT THIS SHOWS US\nTHESE BOMBINGS IN NEW YORK IS THAT THIS IS AN UNSETTLED\nPRESIDENTIAL RACE THAT IS SUBJECT TO OUTSIDE SHOCKS FROM\nHERE ON OUT. YOU KNOW, DONALD TRUMP'S\nCAMPAIGN IS BASED IN PART ON A MESSAGE OF CRACKING DOWN ON\nIMMIGRATION, IF IT TURNS OUT THIS WAS INDEED AN AFGHANI WHO\nIMMIGRATED TO THE UNITED STATES FAIRLY OR UNFAIRLY, THAT PLAYS\nINTO THE TRUMP NARRATIVE THAT WE HAVE TO BE TOUGHER AND CRACK\nDOWN HARDER. I THINK SECRETARY CLINTON DID A\nFINE JOB IN HER PRESS CONFERENCE, BUT SHE WAS SLIGHTLY\nON THE DEFENSIVE THERE WITH QUESTIONS SAYING DOESN'T THIS\nPLAY INTO DONALD TRUMP'S NARRATIVE AND MESSAGE?\nAND TO A DEGREE I THINK IT DOES, AND THESE THINGS WILL CONTINUE\nTO PLAY OUT AND DEBATES WILL BE CRITICAL.\nBUT WE HAVE AN UNSTABLE AND VERY CLOSE PRESIDENTIAL RACE SUBJECT\nTO OUTSIDE INFLUENCE. >> YEAH.\nIT'S TRUE. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT\nBIRTHER CONTROVERSY OR THAT ECONOMIC SPEECH FROM LITERALLY\nJUST DAYS AGO. GUYS, WE HAVE TO CUT IT SHORT\nTODAY. BUSY DAY AS YOU UNDERSTAND.\nTHANKS SO MUCH BEN WHITE AND", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1474300776947.1474297345459.bd97e8cd-d2da-488a-9316-c0fce99356cf.segment1.thumb.jpg", "channel": "355"}], "channel": "355"}, {"videos": [{"start": 949285, "length": 50267.0, "end": 999552, "date": 1474235393555, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1474235165683.1c38de6a-0813-424a-be69-ed96de359216.mp4#t=949.28,999.55", "text": ">>> MORE AHEAD.\nALSO THE POLITICS OF IT.

WE BETTER GET VERY TOUGH, FOLKS.\nVERY TOUGH. >> CLINTON ON THE OTHER HAND,\nMORE MEASURED. SHE TOLD REPORTERS WHEN SHE WAS\nIN TOUCH -- THAT SHE WAS IN TOUCH WITH OFFICIALS FROM NEW\nYORK. THEN SHE SAID THIS ON HER PLANE\nLAST NIGHT. >> I THINK IT'S ALWAYS WISER TO\nWAIT UNTIL YOU HAVE INFORMATION BEFORE MAKING CONCLUSIONS.\nBECAUSE WE ARE JUST IN THE BEGINNING STAGES OF TRYING TO\nDETERMINE WHAT HAPPENED. >> WHAT DO THESE TWO\nDRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT RESPONSES TO THE SAME EVENT TELL US?\nABOUT HOW TRUMP OR CLINTON MAY LEAD OUR NATION, ESPECIALLY\nAFTER A MOTION LIKE THIS, IN FOUR SHORT MONTHS.\nONE WILL BE DOING JUST THAT. HERE TO DISCUSS, WE HAVE OUR\nWASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT FOR THE NEW YORKER.\nAND THE SENIOR EDITOR OF THE \"ATLANTIC.\"\nRON, I THINK WE GOT THE RESPONSES THAT THE PUBLIC WOULD\nEXPECT FROM DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON.\nYES, THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT. WHICH ONE THOUGH DO YOU BELIEVE\nIS THE MOST INDICATIVE OF HOW THEY WOULD ACTUALLY ACT AS A\nCOMMANDER IN CHIEF? THERE IS ONE THING, THE\nRHETORIC, AND WHAT YOU SAY AHEAD OF AN ELECTION TO GET VOTES, AND\nONE THING ABOUT HOW YOU'D ACT IN THE OVAL OFFICE.\n>> I THINK THEY WERE BOTH VERY REVEALING.\nI THINK YOU SAW AN INCREDIBLE DISTILLATION OF MUCH OF THE\nCHOICE IN THE ELECTION IN THE 40 SECONDS OF CONTRASTING VIDEO.\nTRUMP'S GREATEST STRENGTH IS THAT MANY VOTERS VIEW HIM AS\nLIKELY TO BRING CHANGE. HE SAYS WHAT HE MEANS.\nHE WILL BE SOMETHING DIFFERENT. HE WILL NOT BE A TYPICAL\nPOLITICIAN. HE WILL KIND OF GO OUT AND SAY\nWHAT HE BELIEVES AND, NOT INCIDENTALLY, GIVEN HIS\nCOALITION, THAT HE'LL CRACK DOWN ON ALL THE FOREIGN FORCES AND\nINFLUENCES THAT THEY BELIEVE ARE UNDERMINING MANY OF THE VARITIES\nOF AMERICAN LIFE. ON THE OTHER HAND, WHAT YOU SAW\nFROM CLINTON IS HER COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE IN THIS RACE.\nSHE IS A MORE SOBER, YOU KNOW, KIND OF DELIBERATE LEADER, AND\nVOTERS OVERWHELM DINGLY SEE THA. VOTERS SEE TRUMP LIKELY TO BRING\nCHANGE. OTHERS SAY CLINTON IS QUALIFIED\nTO BE PRESIDENT AND COMMANDER IN CHIEF, AND MORE QUALIFIED TO\nHANDLE FOREIGN POLICY. YOU GOT A VERY GOOD SUMMARY OF\nTHE CONTRASTING STYLES AND ARGUMENTS THAT THEY'RE BRINGING\nTO THE VOTERS NOW AND WOULD N LIKELIHOOD, BRING TO THE OVAL\nOFFICE IF ELECTED. >> RYAN, THE ARGUMENT IS OVER.\nDID TRUMP SPEAK TOO SOON BEFORE AUTHORITIES SAID SOMETHING.\nTHE POINT IS HE WAS CORRECT. THIS WOULD BE A DIFFERENT\nSITUATION IF IT WAS NOT A BOMBING.\nASIDE FROM THAT, LISTEN TO WHAT HIS RUNNING MATE, MIKE PENCE,\nSAID ABOUT THE BOMBINGS IN NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY AND THE\nSTABBING IN MINNESOTA TODAY. LISTEN.\n>> AS A GOVERNOR AND A CANDIDATE FOR NATIONAL OFFICE, IT WOULD\nNOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR ME TO COMMENT ON AN ONGOING\nINVESTIGATION, OTHER TO SAY THEY ARE THANKFUL IN OUR HEARTS THAT\nTHERE IS NO LOSS OF LIFE AS A RESULT OF THESE HORRIFIC\nATTACKS. >> SO HE SAYS IT WOULDN'T BE\nAPPROPRIATE FOR HIM TO COMMENT. THAT IS DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT\nTHAN WHAT HIS RUNNING MATE SAID. WHO HANDLED IT IN A WAY THAT IS\nMORE EFFECTIVE IN TERMS OF GARNERING THE VOTES AND THE\nSUPPORT OF THE UNDECIDES THEY NEED?\n>> YOU GET THE SENSE THAT TRUMP AND PENCE ARE NOT ON THE PHONE\nCOORDINATING THEIR RESPONSE TO THIS.\nTHEY ARE SORT OF RUNNING SEPARATE CAMPAIGNS IN A SENSE.\nTHEIR RESPONSES WERE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.\nPENCE'S WAS MORE LIKE CLINTON, WHICH IS WHAT MOST POLITICAL\nLEADERS DO IN A BREAKING NEWS SITUATION.\nFRANKLY, MOST JOURNALISTS, COMMENTATO\nCOMMENTATORS, ANYONE IN THE PUBLIC EYE, WHEN A MAJOR,\nBREAKING NEWS EVENT, WHERE NONE OF US ACTUALLY HAVE THE FACTS,\nYOU TEND TO BE CAREFUL. IF YOU ARE A POLITICAL LEADER,\nIT'S EVEN MORE IMPORTANT TO DO THAT BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO\nSAY SOMETHING THAT GET S AHEAD F THE FACTS.\nPENCE AND CLINTON, LONG-TIME POLITICIANS BOTH KNOW THAT'S THE\nWAY TO OPERATION. TRUMP, YEAH, I PERSONALLY GOT\nTHE SENSE FROM TRUMP THAT -- EVERY TIME THERE HAS BEEN AN\nINCIDENT LIKE THIS, SOME KIND OF TERRORIST ATTACK, HE JUMPS ON IT\nVERY QUICKLY AND HE WANTS TO BE OUT THERE SPEAKING ABOUT IT.\nWHETHER HE KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED OR NOT.\nAT THE TIME HE SPOKE LAST NIGHT, IT WAS NOT KNOWN WHETHER THIS\nWAS TRULY A BOMB. SO HE WAS GETTING AHEAD OF\nHIMSELF. I THINK IF YOU WERE PRESIDENT,\nYOU'D HOPE THAT HE WOULD HAVE PEOPLE AROUND HIM THAT WOULD\nSORT OF CONTAIN THAT UM -- IMPULSE TO SPEAK BEFORE THE\nFACTS ARE THERE. >> WE DIDN'T KNOW.\nTHE MEDIA, THE PUBLIC. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TRUMP OR\nCLINTON OR PRESIDENT OBAMA KNEW. HE SAID, RON, WE BETTER GET\nTOUGH, FOLKS. WE KEPT SAYING, WE'RE GOING TO\nGET TOUGH AND SMART AND VIGILANT.\nHE USED THAT AS AN OPPORTUNITY, WITHOUT, YOU KNOW, CERTAINLY AT\nLEAST KNOWING WHO WAS BEHIND THE ATTACKS BECAUSE THAT'S STILL NOT\nPUBLIC, THAT THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION'S POLICIES AREN'T\nWORKING. THAT'S WHAT HE WAS SAYING.\n>> RIGHT. TWO BIG POINTS, I THINK, ARE\nIMPORTANT HERE. ONE, YOU KNOW, THESE KIND OF\nATTACKS, UNFORTUNATELY, HAVE BECOME A DRUM BEAT IN AMERICAN\nLIFE. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THE\nAMERICAN PUBLIC IS BEING KNOCKED TRULY OFF BALANCE BY THEM.\nPEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT TERROR.\nTHEY SEE A SENSE FOR VIGILANCE. BUT OPINIONS ARE NOT RADICALLY\nSHIFTING AS A RESULT OF THIS. TRUMP GOT A BOOST LAST FALL IN\nTHE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY AROUND THE PARIS AND SAN BERNARDINO\nATTACKS. IN THE GENERAL ELECTION\nATTITUDES, LIKE BANNING MUSLIM IMMIGRATION, IT HAS NOT\nRADICALLY CHANGED MONTH BY MONTH ON THIS.\nTHE SECOND POINT, IT IS STRIKING TRUMP MADE THE COMMENTS YOU\nSITED ON THE SAME DAY THAT ROBERT GATES, THE CIA DIRECTOR,\nDEFENSE SECRETARY FOR GEORGE W. BUSH AND BARACK OBAMA, JOINED A\nLIST OF 50 OTHER SECURITY OFFICIALS IN SAYING HE VIEWED\nTRUMP AS UNFIT AND UNQUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT.\nTHE SAME KIND OF SHOOT FROM THE HIP, YOU KNOW, THAT WE SAW\nYESTERDAY THAT DOES APPEAL TO A SEGMENT OF THE ELECELECTORATE,\nBELIEVES THEY'VE BEEN FAILED. EVEN GOLDWATER IN 1964 DID NOT\nFACE AS MUCH DEFECTION FROM REPUBLICAN NATIONAL SECURITY\nLEADERS AS TRUMP HAS FROM THE LONG TIME OF FORMER CABINET\nOFFICIALS AND OTHERS WHO DO NOT BELIEVE HE'S QUALIFIED TO BE\nPRESIDENT. >> THIS IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF\nRESPONSE TO AN INCIDENT THAT PEOPLE LIKE GATES AND THE SORT\nOF NATIONAL SECURITY ESTABLISHMENT OF THE REPUBLICAN\nPARTY WOULD POINT TO AS, WAIT A SECOND, THIS IS NOT HOW YOU\nOPERATE WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS -- WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS\nGOES DOWN. >> BUT AS WE SAW THOUGH ON THIS\nSHOW YESTERDAY, HE DOES HAVE THE SUPPORT OF FORMER CIA DIRECTOR\nWHO SERVED UNDER PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON.\nTHAT IS ONE NAME IN DEFENSE HE DOES HAVE.\nTHANK YOU.

THE PERSON WHO DID THIS IS\nHORRIBLE PERSON. WE KNOW IS A NATURALIZED\nCITIZEN. THAT DOESN'T MAKE HIM LESS OF AN\nEVIL, EVIL PERSON BUT THEN TO MAKE THIS ABOUT IMMIGRATION IS\nFACTUALLY UNTRUE. THE MANIPULATING, HORRIBLE\nSITUATION FOR POLITICAL MEANS. WHAT WE WANT THE PRESIDENT OF\nTHE UNITED STATES TO BE IS EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF THAT.\nTHAT IS MANIPULATION FOR SELF-GAIN AND THE LAST THING\nTHIS COUNTRY NEEDS AT TIMES LIKE THESE.\n>> SINCE WE DON'T KNOW FACTS YET, WHAT ABOUT QUELLING THE\nANXIETY INSTEAD OF STOKING THE ANXIETY.\nFDR, THERE IS NOTHING TO FEAR BUT FEAR ITSELF.\nTHAT SORT OF LEADERSHIP. >> DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN VERY\nCLEAR.

MR. TRUMP ON HIS PART SPOKE\nABOUT IT OVER THE WEEKEND, AS DID HILLARY CLINTON, BUT MR.\nTRUMP APPEARED ON \"FOX & FRIENDS\" THIS MORNING AND DID\nCOMMENT ON THE BOMBINGS OVER THE WEEKEND.\nHE SLAMMED PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HILLARY CLINTON'S TERROR EFFORTS\nOVERSEAS IN PART FOR THE BOMBINGS HERE IN NEW YORK CITY\nAND IN NEW JERSEY. AND HE SUGGESTED THAT LOCAL\nPOLICE GET TOUGH AND DISPENSE WHAT IS BEING POLITICALLY\nCORRECT. LET'S LISTEN.\n>> THE LOCAL POLICE, THEY KNOW WHO A LOT OF THE PEOPLE ARE.\nTHEY ARE AFRAID TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT\nTO BE ACCUSED OF PROFILING. AND THEY DON'T WANT TO BE\nACCUSED OF ALL SORTS OF THINGS. IN ISRAEL, THEY PROFILE, THEY\nHAVE DONE AN UNBELIEVABLE JOB, BUT ISRAEL HAS DONE AN\nUNBELIEVABLE JOB AND THEY PROFILE.\nTHEY SEE SOMEBODY SUSPICIOUS, THEY WILL PROFILE AND WILL TAKE\nTHAT PERSON IN AND CHECK OUT. DO WE HAVE A CHOICE?\nLOOK WHAT IS GOING ON, DO WE REALLY HAVE A CHOICE?\nWE ARE TRYING TO BE SO POLITICALLY CORRECT IN OUR\nCOUNTRY, AND THIS IS ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE.\n>> ALL RIGHT. SO THAT'S WHAT HE SAID ON \"FOX &\nFRIENDS\" THIS MORNING. HERE TO DISCUSS, NIA MALIK\nHENDERSON AND DAVID CANTANESE. WELCOME TO YOU BOTH.\nDAVID, WHAT WAS MR. TRUMP SUGGESTING THROUGH?\n>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW. I THINK THAT NEEDS MORE PROBING.\nHE'S BASICALLY -- I KNOW HE HAS SUGGESTED DOING THIS IN THE\nPAST, BUT IF HE'S OUTLINING A POSITION OF PROFILING, I THINK\nMORE QUESTIONS HAVE TO BE ASKED OF HIM.\nHOW EXACTLY WOULD HE PROFILE? WHAT STANDARDS WOULD HE USE?\nAND I THINK IN THE LIGHT OF THE INCIDENTS OVER THE WEEKEND, HE\nIS CERTAINLY GOING TO BE ASKED EXACTLY WHAT HE MEANS BY THOSE\nCOMMENTS. AND I CAN'T IMAGINE SECRETARY\nCLINTON AGREEING WITH THAT. >> YEAH, AND NIA MA LIKA, I SAY\nTHAT BECAUSE JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO THEY HAD TO WORK OUT A DEAL\nWITH THIS PROBLEM OF RACIAL PROFILING.\n>> HE'S SAYING THE POLICE AREN'T DOING THEIR JOB BECAUSE THEY ARE\nADP ADPRKS -- AFRAID OF THE\nCONSEQUENCES. I DON'T SUSPECT HE HAS MUCH\nEVIDENCE TO SUGGEST TO LOCAL POLICE THAT THEY AREN'T DOING\nTHEIR JOBS TO THE FULLEST THEY CAN WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF THE\nLAW. SO YEAH, HERE WE GO TALKING\nABOUT TERRORISM AGAIN. I THINK THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM\nIS THAT TERRORISM, WHEN AN INCIDENT LIKE THIS HAPPENS, THAT\nIT BENEFITS DONALD TRUMP. I DON'T THINK THERE'S MUCH\nEVIDENCE THAT THAT IS ACTUALLY TRUE.\nHE DOES LEAD ON TERRORISM IN TERMS OF ASKING PEOPLE WHO WILL\nBE TOUGHER ON HIM. TERRORISM AND ISIS, I THINK\nHILLARY CLINTON HANDLES THE FOREIGN POLICY MORE BROADLY.\nWE'LL SEE WHAT HILLARY CLINTON SAYS TODAY IN THE PRESS\nCONFERENCE. >> BUT AGAIN, DAVID, IT'S THE\nBIG BOLD STATEMENT. HE COMES OUT AND SAYS SOMETHING.\nAND HILLARY CLINTON WILL BE MUCH MORE NUANCED IN HER COMMENTS.\nDOESN'T THAT RESONATE WHEN THINGS LIKE THIS HAPPEN IN OUR\nCOUNTRY? >> WELL, IT USUALLY DOES BECAUSE\nPEOPLE GET SCARED AND SEE THE HEADLINE COMES OUT, THIS IS\nABSOLUTELY FRIGHTENING THIS CAN HAPPEN ON A SIDEWALK OR STREET\nCORNER AT ANY GIVEN, POINT IN TIME.\nLOOK AT THE ROLLING INFORMATION WE GOT OVER THE WEEKEND.\nTHE OTHER PROBLEM WITH THESE EVENTS IS WE HAVE NEVER HAD AS\nMUCH INFORMATION AS WE REQUIRE POLITICIANS TO HAVE WHEN THEY\nMAKE THESE STATEMENTS. I MEAN, ORIGINALLY THEY DIDN'T\nHAVE ANY CONNECTION. YOU HAD POLITICIANS COMING OUT\nTO SAY THERE WAS NO CONNECTION TO THE EVENTS IN NEW JERSEY AND\nNEW YORK. THEN IT WAS UNCLEAR.\nYOU'RE STILL GETTING MIXED SIGNALS ABOUT THIS FROM THE\nSTATE OF NEW YORK AND MAYOR DE BLASIO ABOUT WHETHER THIS WAS\nTERRORISM, WHETHER IT WAS INTENTIONAL.\nIT CHANGED THROUGHOUT THE WEEKEND.\nEVEN OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS THE INFORMATION ON THIS.\nTHEN WE REQUIRE A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE TO COME OUT WITH\nSTATEMENTS ON WHAT THEY WOULD DO.\nAND FRANKLY, THEY'RE NOT GETTING THIS INFORMATION MUCH QUICKER\nTHAN WE ARE. AND TRUMP IS IMPULSIVE.\nHE'S GOING TO BE THE TOUGH GUY TO SLAM DOWN HARD ON THE\nPERPETRATORS, ON THE TERRORISTS. HILLARY CLINTON, THIS IS -- SHE\nIS INHERENTLY MORE CAUTIOUS AND I THINK WLL SEE THAT AGAIN\nTODAY. I THINK SHE WANTS THAT CONTRAST\nWITH DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE SHE THINKS, EVEN IF IT DOESN'T\nBENEFIT HER IN THE SHORT-TERM WHERE PEOPLE WANT A MORE\nEMPHATIC REACTION, THEY TRUST HER MORE IN THE LONG-TERM.\nI THINK THAT IS HER BET. >> WE'LL JUST HAVE TO WAIT AND\nSEE WHAT SHE SAYS, THOSE COMMENTS COMING FROM HILLARY\nCLINTON AT ANY MOMENT. NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON AND DAVID\nCANTANESE, THANK YOU. THE NEXT HOUR OF \"CNN NEWSROOM\"\nBEGINS RIGHT NOW. I'M CAROL COSTELLO.\nOFFICIALS ARE NOW SAYING IT IS POSSIBLE AN ACTIVE TERROR CELL\nCOULD BE OPERATING IN THE NEW YORK/NEW JERSEY AREA AFTER A\nSPRING OF WEEKEND BOMBINGS.

WHAT STRUCK ME A LITTLE BIT IS\nYOU HAVE SORT OF THIS TALE OF TWO REACTIONS.\nYOU, OBVIOUSLY, HAVE HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP, AT THE\nSAME TIME YOU HAVE BILL de BLASIO, A MAYOR WHO CAME OUT AND\nSAID THERE WAS A BOMBING, WE DON'T KNOW THE MOTIVE, SEEMED TO\nBE DOWNPLAYING THIS EXPLOSION IN HIS CITY THAT INJURED 29 PEOPLE,\nWHILE YOU HAD THE GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK, ANDREW CUOMO SAY WE\nWILL NOT LET THEM, MEANING THE BOMBERS, WIN.\nTHESE TWO VERY DIFFERENT VIEWS OF THE WORLD COMING CLEAR HERE.\nI'M WONDERING WHAT ARE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE LOOKING FOR IN A\nTIME LIKE THIS, GARLAND? >> WELL, YOU KNOW, I THINK IN\nTHIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE, I THINK IT'S GOING TO WORK OUT IN\nHILLARY'S FAVOR. THE WAY I SEE IT, DONALD TRUMP\nCAME OUT WITH THE RATHER AUTHORITARIAN KIND OF RESPONSE,\nI DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED, BUT I KNOW WE HAVE TO GO PUNCH\nSOMEBODY, AND WHILE THAT MAY BE POPULAR WITH THE DEBATES, I\nDON'T THINK AMONG INDEPENDENTS IT'S GOING TO WORK, WHEREAS\nHILLARY'S NUANCED RESPONSE, I THINK THAT WILL BE POPULAR WITH\nTHE DEBATES, BUT I THINK THAT WILL EVEN BE MORE POPULAR WITH\nTHE -- WITH INDEPENDENTS. >> ALEXANDRA, I WANT YOU TO\nREACT TO THIS, BECAUSE THERE ARE POLL NUMBERS THAT SUPPORT WHAT\nGARLAND IS SAYING. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS FOX NEWS\nPOLL ABOUT EACH CANDIDATE'S TEMPERAMENT AS IT RELATES TO\nBEING PRESIDENT. WHO HAS THE TEMPERAMENT TO SERVE\nEFFECTIVELY AS PRESIDENT, CLINTON YES 59%, TRUMP, NO, 59%.\nLOOK AT THAT SPLIT HERE. HOW DOES DONALD TRUMP SWITCH\nTHAT TO BE SOMEBODY THAT PEOPLE SAY IN TIMES OF CRISIS, WHEN WE\nMAY NOT BE IN A FULL CRISIS RIGHT NOW, BUT CERTAINLY\nCONCERNING EVENTS WHEN YOU PUT TOGETHER MINNESOTA AND NEW YORK\nAND POSSIBLY NEW JERSEY AND SAY WHO DO WE WANT TO BE IN THE OVAL\nOFFICE, IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THEY ARE SAYING TRUMP'S\nREACTIONS ARE THE ONES THAT THEY WANT.\n>> LOOK, THIS IS, OBVIOUSLY, A VERY SERIOUS SITUATION.\nFIRST OF ALL, I THINK IF THE NYPD AND FBI OUGHT TO BE COMMEND\nTHE ON THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND DILIGENCE FOR KEEPING NEW\nYORKERS SAFE IN THIS SITUATION, BUT I THINK HILLARY CLINTON'S\nRESPONSE IN THIS SITUATION WAS A POLITICALLY STUPID ONE.\nTHIS WHOLE WAR OVER SEMANTICS OVER WHO SAID BOMBING AND WHO\nSAID WHAT WHEN, I THINK THIS IS THE THING THAT TURNS INDEPENDENT\nVOTERS OFF. THIS IS CLASSIC CLINTON SMOKE\nAND MIRRORS. WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN \"THE\nWASHINGTON POST\" SAYS YOU HAVE THE WORST WEEK IN WASHINGTON,\nWHAT DO YOU DO WHEN POLL NUMBERS ARE COLLAPSING, PARTICULARLY\nAMONG A BASE OF PEOPLE THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA CAPTURED IN 2012\nSO STRIDENTLY, WHICH IS MILLENNIALS, WHAT DO YOU DO IN\nTHAT SITUATION, PICK A WAR OVER SEMANTICS, BUT THE AVERAGE\nAMERICAN CAN LOOK OUT AT THE WORLD TODAY AND SEE WHAT\nHAPPENED IN MINNESOTA, NEW JERSEY, NEW YORK, AND SEE THAT\nTHE COUNTRY IS OBVIOUSLY UNFAZED FROM ENEMIES FOREIGN AND\nDOMESTIC. THE FACT DONALD TRUMP HAD A\nSTRONGER RESPONSE THAN HILLARY CLINTON IN THE SITUATION, AND BY\nTHE WAY SHE ALSO LABELED THE ATTACK AS A BOMBING, HER\nATTEMPTS TO REVERSE THAT NOW LOOK COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY\nPOLITICALLY STUPID. >> EVEN THE GOVERNOR OF NEW\nYORK, DEMOCRAT HIMSELF, CALLING IT TERRORISM, OBVIOUSLY TERROR,\nSAYING WE WON'T LET THEM WIN AND SCARE US, DIFFERENT, MUCH MORE\nFORCEFUL RESPONSE THAN HILLARY CLINTON HAD LAST NIGHT.\nWE'LL SEE IF HILLARY CLINTON COMES OUT WITH SOMETHING ON\nTWITTER OR SOMEWHERE ELSE. APPRECIATE BOTH OF YOU GUYS\nBEING HERE, THANKS. >> THANKS FOR HAVING US.\n>> ALL THE BEST.", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1474223844526.1474220741282.9becc46c-0a93-4a3d-86fd-cdbf197eb348.segment8.thumb.jpg", "channel": "360"}, {"start": 307458.0, "length": 266511.0, "end": 573969, "date": 1474228377606, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1474230679250.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1474228057800-822a77d3-8f9b-4995-82fc-35c6a7544316-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=307.46,573.97", "text": ">> WELCOME BACK, 51 DAYS UNTIL\nELECTION DAY AND LATEST POLL SHOWS THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE\nTIGHTENING NOT JUST NATIONWIDE BUT IN THE KEY SWING STATES AS\nWELL.

THE REAL CLEAR POLITICS AVERAGE\nOF POLLS HAS TRUMP AND CLINTON DEAD EVEN WITH 51 DAYS TO GO\nUNTIL ELECTION DAY. DESPITE TRUMP'S RECENT SURGE IN\nTHE POLLS, THERE'S STILL UNDERLYING VOTER ATTITUDES THAT\nTEND TO FAVOR CLINTON. 61% OF THE LIKELY VOTERS POLLED\nSAY CLINTON IS QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT, WITH ONLY 45% SAY\nTRUMP IS QUALIFIED.

YOU UNDERSTAND THE DESIRE OF\nMANY IN THE NATIONAL MEDIA TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT FROM HILLARY\nCLINTON'S DISASTROUS RECORD AND HER DISHONESTY, BUT WE'RE NOT\nGOING TO PLAY THAT GAME. >> BUT DEMOCRAT TIM KAINE TOLD\nFOX NEWS SUNDAY, IT'S NOT OVER AND HE HAD SEVERAL QUESTIONS\nABOUT IT FOR DONALD TRUMP. >> WHAT I HOPE SOMEBODY WILL ASK\nDONALD TRUMP IS, WHEN YOU WERE DOING THAT FOR FIVE YEARS, DID\nYOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT TO BE TRUE IN WHICH CASE HOW GULLIBLE\nARE YOU? HOW BIZARRELY CON SPIR TORIAL\nARE YOU? OR WERE YOU AWARE IT WASN'T\nTRUE? IF SO, WHY WERE YOU TRYING TO\nWHIP UP THE DARKEST EMOTIONS RELATED TO THE MOST PAINFUL\nCHAPTER IN LIFE? >> TOMORROW WE HIT THE 50-DAY\nMARK AND CLINTON WILL SPEND IT SPEAKING TO MILLENNIALS IN\nPENNSYLVANIA AND TRUMP WILL BE IN FLORIDA, TRUMP WOULD WIN\nFLORIDA IF THE ELECTION WERE HELD TODAY.\n>> FLORIDA HAS SOME OF THE MOST VALUABLE REAL ESTATE WHEN IT\nCOMES TO ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES.\nTHANKS, KRISTIN. >> THANK YOU.\n>> SHANNON HAS MORE. >> SEE THEM AS AN ACCURATE\nREFLECTION AS WHO HAS THE BEST CHANCE OF WINNING THE WHITE\nHOUSE, OFTEN THEY ARE NOT. THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE ULTIMATELY\nCAST THE VOTES THAT DETERMINE WHO WILL BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT.\nSO TAKING A LOOK AT HOW INDIVIDUAL STATES ARE POLLING\nAND THE ELECTORAL VOTES THEY HOLD, THAT CAN BE MORE INSIGHT\nIF THE. IT 270 ELECTORAL VOTES TO BECOME\nPRESIDENT. HERE'S WHERE WE STAND RIGHT NOW.\nTHE RED STATES, WHICH RUN THROUGH THE HEARTLAND OF THE\nCOUNTRY, THOSE ARE WHAT WE SEE SOLIDLY IN THE GOP COLUMN FOR\nNOW. MISSOURI IN THE MIDDLE,\nCLASSIFIED AS LEANING GOP, AND DARK BLUE ONES LIKE CALIFORNIA,\nWE JUDGE THOSE AS SOLIDLY DEMOCRAT, ACCOUNT FOR 201 VOTES\nAND LIGHTER BLUE LEANING DEMOCRAT, ANOTHER 72 VOTES.\nIF HILLARY CLINTON CAN HANG ONTO THE SOLIDLY AND LEANING\nDEMOCRAT, SHE'S ALREADY OVER THE 270 VOTES SHE NEEDS TO GET TO\nTHE WHITE HOUSE. IN YELLOW, YOU SEE SCATTERED\nAROUND, THOSE ARE OUR TOSS-UP STATES AND WORTH 101 VOTES.\nTO PULL OFF A WIN, TRUMP WOULD NOT ONLY NEED TO TAKE AT LEAST\nONE OF THE LEANING DEMOCRAT STATES BUT GET BIG YELLOW STATE\nPRIZES LIKE OHIO AND FLORIDA.

IN FACT IT'S REALLY THE FIRST\nTHING HE SAID WHEN HE GOT OFF THE AIRPLANE.\nHE WAS GREETED BY SUPPORTERS AND SAID, LOOK, IT'S TIME FOR US TO\nDOUBLE DOWN. HIS RUNNING MATE MIKE PENCE ALSO\nSPEAKING OUT TODAY. >> JUST BEFORE I GOT OFF THE\nPLANE, A BOMB WENT OFF IN NEW YORK AND NOBODY KNOWS EXACTLY\nWHAT'S GOING ON. WE ARE GOING TO GET TOUGH AND\nSMART AND VIGILANT. >> WHETHER IT WAS TERRORIST\nATTACKS OR INSPIRED BY TERRORISTS ABROAD, AS YOU\nEXPERIENCED HERE IN FLORIDA NOT LONG AGO OR WHETHER IT WAS HOME\nGROWN VIOLENCE, WE URGE PRAYER AND VIGILANCE.\n>> ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE, WE SAW HILLARY CLINTON\nRESPONDING MORE CAUTIOUSLY ON HER PLANE LAST NIGHT.\nCRITICS SAY SHE APPEARED UNCOMPRESSIVE BUT HER SUPPORTERS\nSAY SHE WAS COMPOSED AND FORMAL AND ALSO REFERRING TO IT AS A\nBOMB INITIALLY AND THEN SAYING DONALD TRUMP GOT AHEAD OF THE\nINVESTIGATION, SAYING MORE INFORMATION IS NEEDED BEFORE\nRESPONDING. TIM KAINE PRAISING HER FOR HER\nTONE AND PRUDENCE. >> I THINK IT'S ALWAYS WISER TO\nWAIT UNTIL YOU HAVE INFORMATION BEFORE MAKING CONCLUSIONS\nBECAUSE WE ARE JUST IN THE BEGINNING STAGES OF TRYING TO\nDETERMINE -- >> I KNOW EVERYONE IS LOOKING TO\nSEE WHAT THE CAUSE WAS. COULD IT POTENTIALLY BE\nCONNECTED TO TERRORISM, NO EVIDENCE YET BUT THAT WILL BE\nLOOKED AT CLOSELY. >> DONALD TRUMP WILL HEAD TO THE\nSUNSHINE STATE ON MONDAY AND HILLARY CLINTON WILL HEAD TO\nPHILADELPHIA.

IS THIS SORT OF METHODICAL\nALMOST ACADEMIC APPROACH TO A TERROR ATTACK LIKE THIS THE\nRIGHT WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS, SAYING WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S\nBEHIND IT, WE'RE GOING TO ANALYZE IT, OR IS IT THE ANDREW\nCUOMO APPROACH THIS IS TERRORISM OR DONALD TRUMP OF WE'VE GOT TO\nGET TOUGH? >> WELL, IT NEEDS TO BE A\nPRESIDENTIAL APPROACH. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE SEEING\nFROM HILLARY CLINTON. EARLIER IN THIS HOUR YOU TALKED\nABOUT POLLING THAT SAID THAT PEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONS WHETHER OR\nNOT DONALD TRUMP CAN BE PRESIDENTIAL.\nYOU CAN'T HAVE KNEE JERK REACTIONS TO THIS TYPE OF STUFF.\nTHIS IS LIFE AND DEATH MATTERS. THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE WHERE\nDONALD TRUMP IS JUMPING AHEAD MAKING RIDICULOUS STATEMENTS AND\nHILLARY CLINTON IS SHOWING A RESERVED PRAGMATIC APPROACH.\n>> I'M PRETTY SURE WHEN YOU PUT A BUNCH OF WIRES AND EXPLOSIVE\nDEVICES INSIDE A PRESSURE COOKER, IT'S ACCURATE TO CALL IT\nA BOMB. THAT'S WHAT DONALD TRUMP DID.\nIT WAS A BOMB. WE'RE PRETTY SURE IT WASN'T PUT\nTHERE BY THE VIENNA BOYS CLUB. THIS IS SOME TERRORIST ACTIVITY\nEVENT THAT TOOK PLACE IN NEW YORK AND DONALD TRUMP'S REACTION\nWAS RIGHT AND I THINK HILLARY CLINTON -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE\nWAS ON LAST NIGHT, BUT SHE WAS LOW ENERGY I THINK TO SAY THE\nLEAST. >> IT DID NOT EXACTLY SEEM LIKE\nA -- SHALL WE SEE SAY, IF A COMFORTER IN CHIEF, TALKING\nABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER AND BECOME\nSTRONGER TOGETHER DESPITE THAT BEING HER CAMPAIGN SLOGAN.\nYOU TALKED ABOUT THAT POLL THAT WE DISCUSSED EARLIER IN THE\nSHOW. WE'LL PUT IT BACK UP ON THE\nSCREEN SO VIEWERS CAN TAKE A LOOK.\nCLINTON 59%, YES. TRUMP, 59% NO.\nTHIS GOES TO AN ISSUE FOR YOU IN MISSOURI, A SWING STATE AND\nOBVIOUSLY NOW THAT TRUMP IS A REPUBLICAN NOMINEE THE POLLS ARE\nTIGHTER IN MISSOURI THAN ANYBODY EVER THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.\nIS THE ISSUE OF TEMPERAMENT A PROBLEM FOR SOME MISSOURI VOTER\nSNZ. >> IT'S AN ISSUE, ONE OF A\nNUMBER OF ISSUES IN THE ELECTION.\nTHE TRUTH IS DONALD TRUMP'S NUMBERS ARE GETTING STRONGER ALL\nTHE TIME IN MISSOURI. THERE WAS A STATE POLL RELEASED\nTHIS MORNING THAT SHOWS HIM WITH AN 8-POINT LEAD AND GROWING.\nA LOT OF TRENDS YOU'VE BEEN SEEING NATIONALLY WITH A RACE\nTIGHTENING UP HAS BEEN WORKING IN MISSOURI WHERE TRUMP HAS\nGAINED MOMENTUM AND HILLARY CLINTON HAS HAD A DIVE OVER THE\nLAST THREE WEEKS. IT'S GOING TO BE A CLOSE RACE.\n>> THE REALITY IS THIS SHOULD BE A LAY-UP FOR REPUBLICANS IN\nMISSOURI. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS,\nDONALD TRUMP'S BEHAVIOR AND THE WAY HE HAS KNEE-JERK RESPONSES\nTO THINGS, JUST LIKE YOUR POLLING IS SHOWING, IS MAKING\nTHIS RACE MUCH CLOSER THAN IT NEEDS TO BE FOR REPUBLICANS AND\nTHAT MEANS RESOURCES ARE COMING INTO MISSOURI AND ROY BLUNT IS\nLIKELY IN TROUBLE AS A RESULT OF IT.\n>> YOU'VE GOT THE FIRST WORD, I'M GOING TO GIVE JOHN THE LAST\nWORD ON THAT ISSUE. YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT TEMPERAMENT\nIS NEEDED. THIS IS THE SAME MESSAGE DONALD\nTRUMP GAVE AND ANDREW CUOMO ON THE STREETS OF NEW YORK TODAY, A\nDEMOCRAT GETTING UP THERE AND SAYING WE'RE GOING TO BE STRONG\nAND NOT GOING TO LET THEM WIN. IT WAS A MUCH TOUGHER MESSAGE\nFROM THE GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK THAN YOU GOT FROM A PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATE. YOU'VE GOT TO AT LEAST SEE THAT\nAS A VULNERABILITY? >> NO, I THINK TRUMP'S RESPONSE\nWAS GOOD. HE SAID LOOK WE'VE GOT TO GET\nTOUGH ON THESE PEOPLE AND GET BETTER INTELLIGENCE AND TAKE THE\nFIGHT TO THEM. WE'VE GOT TO WEED THESE THINGS\nOIT BEFORE THEY HAPPEN. I THINK TRUMP'S TONE ON\nTERRORISM THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN, THIS GUY WILL CALL IT\nWHAT IT IS, RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM, THE WHITE HOUSE CAN'T\nSEEM TO FIGURE THAT OUT. I THINK ON TERRORISM ON NATIONAL\nSECURITY, I THINK DONALD TRUMP SCORES VERY WELL WITH THE\nVOTERS. >> THE FBI HAD A HARD TIME\nCALLING IT TERRORISM TODAY IN MINNESOTA DESPITE THE ALLAH\nAKBAR AND ASKING PEOPLE IF THEY WERE MUSLIM BEFORE STABBING\nTHEM. WE'LL SEE WHAT THE PRESIDENTND A INY LL STOCLBOAYNUT A IT GOG FORWARD.\nALWAYS GREAT TO HAVE YOU ON THE PROGRAM.\nTHANKS FOR COMING IN AND STAYING LATE.\n>> TAKE IT EASY. >> SEE YOU GUYS.\n>> PRESIDENT OBAMA HAMMERS OUT A MULTIBILLION DOLLAR DEAL WITH\nISRAEL. BUT SOME LAWMAKERS SAY IT'S FULL\nOF DETAILS THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY GOOD ONES FOR ONE OF\nOUR CLOSEST ALLIES.

DONALD TRUMP IS TELLING YOU HE\nDOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING, WITH THE HAT, ON PLANE, WE HAVE NO IDEA\nWHAT IS GOING ON, BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT IT.\nYOU HAVE HILLARY CLINTON WHO WAITS ALL THAT TIME, AND SHE\nCOMES OUT AND LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE HIT HER WITH A BLOW DART, SEE\nDATE, AND CALM. >> SHE SO CALM SHE IS BARELY\nSEEMING ALERT.

AND THE TRUTH IS WE CAN'T TELL\nWHAT THE FILTER IS GOING TO BE FOR PEOPLE ON THIS.\nAFTER THE ORLANDO ORLANDO ATTACK WHICH WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF JUNE,\nWE SAW A PRECIPITOUS DECLINE FOR TRUMP'S POLL NUMBERS.\nI ATTRIBUTED MORE THAN OTHERS TO RESPONSE TO THE ORLANDO ORLANDO\nATTACKS NOT BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON HANDLED IT PARTICULARLY\nWELL BUT HE HAD A ROUGH SPOTTY THING WITH THE N.R.A., AND SO\nON. I WANT YOU TO SEE THIS, BECAUSE\nTHIS IS WORTH TALKING ABOUT, ACTUALLY, WE HAVE FRESH NUMBERS\nFROM THE FOX NEWS POLL THAT ARE SO GOOD.\nHERE IS WHO IS QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT AND THAT IS HILLARY\nCLINTON, 61% TO TRUMP'S 45% AND THEN WE LOOK AT THE OTHER ONE\nWHICH IS PROBABLY EVEN MORE IMPORTANT IN THIS QUESTION, HAS\nTHE TEMPER MEANT TO THE 39ESIDENT, 59% FOR CLINTON AND\nR % LDDOFONA T.RUMP\nCK  MHI HAVE HAD THE TEMPERAMENT\nOF A DRUGGED ZOO ANIMAL BUT IT WAS MORE PRESIDENTIAL AND CALMER\nTHAN TRUMP WHICH SHE WOULD HAVE TO HOPE FOR.\n>> THAT POLL WAS TAKEN BEFORE YESTERDAY.\n>> WE DID NOT CONDUCT THAT PRESIDENT OVERNIGHT.\nWE DID NOT DO THIS OVERNIGHT.

THERE ARE UNDECIDED NUMBERS, BY\nELIMINATION, THAT HAVE TO BE UNDECIDED VOTERS THAT FEEL MORE\nCOMFORTABLE WITH HILLARY CLINTON THAN TRUMP.\nSO HEAD TO HEAD IT IS TIE BUT FUR HILLARY CLINTON YOU HOPE\nWHEN THERE IS BAD NEWS, DIFFICULTY, YOU ARE AT AN\nADVANTAGE. >> BUT COULD DONALD TRUMP\nBENEFIT FROM BEING THE CANDIDATE FROM THE OUT PARTY?\nIN PEOPLE THINK, DO WE REALLY WANT ANOTHER FOREIGN POLICY,\nFOUR MORE YEARS OF OBAMA. THAT IS WHAT HILLARY CLINTON\nBASICALLY IS SAYING LET'S STAY THE COURSE, AND THE QUESTION ON\nTHIS, WHAT TERRORISTS WANT TO DO IS THEY WANT TO CHANGE YOUR WAY\nOF LIFE, THEY WANT TO INSTILL FEAR AND HAVE DOUBT AND SHE IS\nTRYING TO BE VERY CALM AND DONALD TRUMP IS SAYING I WILL DO\nSOMETHING ABOUT IT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY CAN DO.\n>> IN THERE WAS AN EFFORT BY PRESIDENT OBAMA THAT WAS\nSUCCESSFUL, IN TERMS OF COMMUNICATION AND POLITICAL\nCOMMUNICATION IT WAS GETTING AMERICANS TO EXPECT LESS ON THIS\nQUESTION. AMERICAN USE WILL RECALL WHEN\nYOU WERE IN THE HOUSE, WHAT WAS THE LINE?\nWE HAVE TO BE RIGHT EVERY TIME, THE TERRORISTS ONLY HAVE TO BE\nRIGHT ONCE. IN THE TIME OF LONE WOLF\nDOMESTIC TERRORISM, AMERICANS IN THIS ERA, WE TALK ABOUT\nDWAYNEING DEVIANTSCY DOWN, IT IS NOW THE NEW NORMAL EVERY SIX\nMONTHS EVERY SO OFTEN AND WE DO NOT KNOW THE FACTS.\n>> WHAT IS TROUBLING, THE NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS SAID\nIN THE PAST FEW HOURS THE FIVE BOMBS THAT WENT OFF IN NEW\nJERSEY YESTERDAY, ARE RELATED, TO THE ONES THAT WENT OFF HERE\nIN NEW YORK. .WOULD DO YOU THAT?\nA DRY RUN? THE UNIDENTIFIED MALE CAMING\nSUNDAY SAYING THERE WILL BE MORE, MY POINT ON THIS THE\nPOLITICS SIDE, IS THAT DONALD TRUMP HAD A CHOICE, REALLY, HE\nIS THE OUTPARTY CANDIDATE, HE WILL BE DIFFERENT.\nHOW MUCH DIFFERENT CAN HE BE THAT WOULD ACTUALLY AFFECT\nCHANGE AND PROTECT PEOPLE? >> HOW MUCH HAY DID OBAMA MAKE\nNOT FOUR MORE YEARS OF BUSH. >> EIGHT YEARS OUT OF THAT?\n>> RIGHT. AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES. AS IT TURNS OUT.\nTHE BEST POSITION FROM WHICH TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT, AMERICA, IS\nTHE POSITION IN WHICH YOUR PARTY IS NOT IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND\nYOU ON THE OUTSIDE.

INVESTIGATORS THEY ARE ON HIGH\nALERT LOOKING FOR ANYTHING AND CERTAINLY OUR CORR ADDRESS\nSPONTANEOUS DENS WE ARE OUT IN FULL FORCE.\nFOLLOWING THE DEVELOPMENTS IN NEW YORK.\nALSO RACHEL CRANE IS IN ELIZABETH NEW JERSEY WITH MORE\nON THAT SUSPICIOUS PACKAGE THAT WAS FOUND.\nLET'S GO TO RACHEL FIRST. >> WELL, GEORGE, WE'RE HERE IN\nHE ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY. WE JUST SPOKE TO THE MAYOR ABOUT\nTHIS ON GOING SITUATION. HE DESCRIBED WHAT HAPPENED HERE\nTHIS EVENING. HE SAID THAT TWO GENTLEMEN SAW A\nBACKPACK IN A TRASH CAN VERY CLOSE TO A LOCAL PUB AND ALSO\nVERY CLOSE TO THE TRAIN STATION HERE.\nTHEY OPENED THE BACKPACK THINKING THEY WOULD FIND\nSOMETHING VALUABLE AND INSTEAD THEY FOUND A VERY SUSPICIOUS\nLOOKING DEVICE WITH WIRES COMING OUT OF IT.\nTHAT'S WHEN THEY DROPPED THAT BACKPACK AND WENT AROUND THE\nCORNER TO THE LOCAL POLICE STATION.\nTHE LOCAL AUTHORITIES RESPONDED AND THAT'S WHEN THEY ALSO\nCONFIRMED THAT PACKAGE WAS SUSPICIOUS LOOKING.\nAS YOU CAN SEE THIS WAS OBVIOUSLY STILL AN ON GOING\nSITUATION. THAT'S WHEN THEY ALSO THEN THE\nLOCAL AUTHORITIES CALLED IN THE BOMB SQUAD AS WELL AS THE FBI.\nNOW THE MAYOR ALSO TOLD US THAT THAT BACKPACK, THE DEVICES\nINSIDE UP TO FIVE DEVICES BUT ALSO DESCRIBED TO US WHEN ONE OF\nTHE ROBOTS ACCIDENTALLY DETONATED ONE.\nTAKE A LISTEN. >> THE ROBOTS THAT WERE GOING IN\nTO DISARL IT CUT A WIRE AND IT EXPLODED.\nAND I KNOW THERE'S OTHER DEVICES.\nI DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR MADE UP OF BUT THEY'LL HAVE TO BE\nREMOVED. ALL THE FRAGMENTS IN THE OTHER\nPIECE HAVE TO BE PICKED UP SO THE FBI CAN INVESTIGATE THIS\nFULLY. >> THEY WENT ON TO SAY THERE'S\nNO TIMER AND NO CELL PHONE CONNECTED TO THOSE DEVICES.\nNOW THE AREA HERE, THE STREETS HAVE ALL BEEN CLOSED DOWN.\nTRAIN SERVICE HAS BEEN SUSPENDED BETWEEN NEW YORK HIBERTY AIRPORT\nAND ELIZABETH NEW JERSEY. UNCLEAR WHEN IT WILL BE RESTORED\nBUT CERTAINLY EVERYBODY HERE IN HE ELIZABETH NEW JERSEY, ALL THE\nLOCAL AUTHORITIES RESPONDING TO THE SITUATION AND ON HEIGHTENED\nALERT. >> YEAH AND IT'S ABOUT TO BE A\nMONDAY MORNING COMMUTER TIME SO THIS IS ANOTHER DISRUPTION.\nHOW FAR IS ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY FROM MANHATTAN?\n>> IT TOOK US ABOUT 30 MINUTES TO GET HERE NATALIE THIS\nEVENING. THAT OBVIOUSLY WITH NO TRAFFIC.\nSO IT'S NOT TOO FAR BUT IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT A STONE'S THROW\nAWAY. >> OKAY.\nRACHEL CRANE FOR US THERE. OBVIOUSLY VERY ACTIVE SCENE AT\nTHE INVESTIGATION WITH THE FIRE TRUCK GOING RIGHT PAST HER AS\nSHE SPOKE. >> ALSO IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT\nTHAT SITUATION IN NEW JERSEY NOT BEING CONNECTED AT THIS POINT TO\nTHE SITUATION IN MANHATTAN AND THAT'S WHERE WE WANT TO GO NOW\nLIVE TO DEBORAH FOLLOWING THE INVESTIGATION IN NEW YORK.\nDEBORAH, SO, YOU KNOW, TALK TO US, IF YOU COULD ABOUT THE\nLATEST, WE UNDERSTAND THIS TRAFFIC STOP WAS MADE ON A\nBRIDGE THAT HAS BEEN CONNECTED TO THE BOMBING INCIDENT.\nTHE EXPLOSION. >> WELL THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.\nIT'S UNCLEAR WHAT SPECIFICALLY LEAD INVESTIGATORS BOTH FROM THE\nFBI AND THE NYPD TO MAKE THIS PARTICULAR TRAFFIC STOP BUT THEY\nWERE STOPPED ON THE BRIDGE AND THAT BRIDGE CONNECTS STATEN\nISLAND WITH BROOKLYN BUT IF YOU GO IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION YOU\nCAN GET TO NEW JERSEY. SO THERE'S LINKS BETWEEN THE\nDIFFERENT AREAS WHERE THESE DEVICES SEEM TO BE SHOWING UP\nAND YOU GOT LAW ENFORCEMENT, HUNDREDS OF MEN AND WOMEN WHO\nARE REALLY THINKING ABOUT WHAT THESE DEVICES ARE AND HOW THEY\nCOULD POTENTIALLY BE CONNECTED AND THIS IS ALL PUT OF THE\nINVESTIGATION. WE CAN TELL YOU YOURS IS IN\nTOTALITY. YOU HAD THREE DEVICES FOUND\nYESTERDAY, SATURDAY. TWO IN MANHATTAN.\nONE IN NEW JERSEY. ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF FROM\nTHE LOCATION OF THE OTHER DEVICES BUT NOW YOU GOT THESE IN\nELIZABETH NEW JERSEY AND JUST TO PUT IT IN CONTEXT, HE LIZ PELTH,\nNEW JERSEY IS ABOUT FIVE MILES FROM NEWARK AIRPORT AND THAT'S\nWHY YOU HAVE THAT STRETCH FROM ELIZABETH TO NEWARK CLOSE DOWN\nRIGHT NOW BUT THEY'RE LOOKING AT ALL OF THIS TO SEE WHETHER\nTHERE'S SIMILARITIES IN THE DEVICES.\nWE DO KNOW THE DEVICES APPEAR TO HAVE HAD A CELL PHONE ATTACHED\nTO THEM. BUT THE ONES IN NEW JERSEY WERE\nONLY ONE OF THE THREE PIPE BOMBS DETONATED YESTERDAY.\nAND THESE ARE THE COMMONALITIES AND IT HAPPENS TO MAKE A GREAT\nCONSEQUENCE AND I SPOKE TO A SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL\nEARLIER TODAY. WHEN YOU HAVE THESE YOU HAVE TO\nLOOK MORE DEEPLY BECAUSE IT DOESN'T USUALLY BREAK THAT WAY.\n>> WE'RE SEEING THIS CAR THAT THEY WERE INVESTIGATING AND I\nKNOW YOU WERE STANDING THERE EARLIER REPORTING ON WHAT WAS\nGOING ON. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT.\n>> THERE'S THE FACT THAT THIS CAR HAD NEW JERSEY LICENSE\nPLATES. YESTERDAY IN NEW JERSEY THE\nQUESTION WAS COULD THAT BE CONNECTED?\nAND WHY IS IT IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA OF WHERE THESE DEVICES\nFOUND IN MANHATTAN. IT COULD ALSO BE THAT THIS CAR\nHAS SHRAPNEL IN IT. CLEARLY THERE'S EVIDENCE.\nYOU CAN SEE THERE WAS A WOMAN THERE TAKING A LOT OF\nPHOTOGRAPHS AND WORKING AT DIFFERENT MARKS AND THINGS IN\nTHE CAR AND TOOK IT AWAY FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS.\nSO THAT WAS A PARTICULAR INTEREST.\nTHE FACT THAT IT WAS PARKED ON 23rd STREET JUST A BLOCK FROM\nWHERE THAT DEVICE DETONATED THAT IS ALSO OF INTEREST.\nHOW IT ENDED UP THERE. SO INVESTIGATORS NOW ARE GETTING\nENOUGH CLUES AND ENOUGH DETAILS THAT THEY CAN BEGIN TO SORT OF\nSPIDER OUT FROM THERE AND LOOK AT HOW THE THREADS CONNECT.\n>> AND THEY HAVE THAT VIDEO SURVEILLANCE AS WELL.\nIT'S CERTAINLY ON GOING. >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR REPORTING.\nRACHEL CRANE ON THE SCENE IN ELIZABETH NEW JERSEY.\nWE'LL STAY IN TOUCH WITH YOU BOTH.\n>> JUST BEFORE THAT EXPLOSION WENT OFF AT NEW YORK STABBINGS\nAT A SHOPPING MALL IN STFLT CLOUD, MINNESOTA.\nWOUNDED AT LEAST 9 PEOPLE. ONE CRITICALLY.\nTHE FBI IS INVESTIGATING THAT INCIDENT AS A POTENTIAL ACT OF\nTERROR. ONE WITNESS THAT WORKED AT THE\nMALL DESCRIBED WHAT SHE SAW. LISTEN.\n>> ALL OF A SUDDEN CHAOS JUST BROKE OUT.\nTHERE IS A BUNCH OF PEOPLE RUNNING INTO THE JCPENNEY MALL\nENTRANCE AND THEY WERE JUST SCREAMING THAT SOMEONE WAS GOING\nAROUND THE MALL STABBING PEOPLE AND THAT THERE WAS BLOOD\nEVERYWHERE. AND IT WAS JUST HONESTLY A\nREALLY SCARY THING AND TROPICAL WAVED EVERYTHING AND BOOKED IT\nBACK TO MY CO-WORKER TO NOTIFY HER WHAT WAS GOING ON.\nI RAN OUT A DIFFERENT EXIT OUT OF OUR JCPENNEYS THAT LEAD\nSTRAIGHT TO THE PARKING LOT AND I JUMPED INTO MY CAR AND RAN OFF\nAS FAST AS I COULD. >> THAT HAD TO BE TERRIFYING.\nPOLICE SAY THE ATTACKER APPEARS TO HAVE ACTED ALONE.\nTHE CITY'S MAYOR PRAISED THE OFF DUTY POLICE OFFICER THAT SHOT\nAND KILLED THE ATTACKER. >> HE CLEARLY PREVENTED\nADDITIONAL INJURIES AND LOSS OF LIFE.\nHIS HEROIC ACTIONS OR HAVING WITNESSED WHAT HE DID AND THE\nSUSPECT IS LUNGING WITH HIM AND NOT ONLY DID HE FIRE BUT THE\nSUSPECT WENT DOWN AND CAME BACK UP ON THREE DIFFERENT OCCASIONS.\n>> SO IF YOU'RE COUNTING THERE'S A SITUATION THERE IN MINNESOTA.\nTWO SITUATIONS IN NEW JERSEY. AND WE'RE DISCOVERING TONIGHT\nAND ALSO CERTAINLY NEW YORK. FRONT AND CENTER.\nTHERE WAS NO CLEAR LINK BETWEEN ALL THE ATTACKS THROUGHOUT THE\nU.S. IT'S THE TIMING RAISING A LOT OF\nCONCERN. >> WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE TIMING\nTHAT IS INTERESTING TO YOU? >> FIRST OF ALL IT'S ALL\nHAPPENING SO FAST. ALL WITHIN THE PERIOD OF 24\nHOURS THIS IS ALL TAKING PLACE AND ORDINARILY I WOULD PUT THE\nTIMING TO OCTOBER AND OCTOBER WAS ALWAYS THE MONTH WHERE WE\nWERE NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE AS MUCH LOCATION.\nTIME OFF WAS LIMITED AND YOU COULDN'T SCHEDULE THINGS BECAUSE\nOF THE GENERAL IS SEMIBLI. AND MOVING ALL AROUND THE CITY\nSO YOU HAVE EXTRA SECURITY FROM THOSE COUNTRIES COMING IN.\nYOU HAVE EXTRA SECRET SERVICE. A STATE DEPARTMENT DIPLOMATIC\nSECURITY AND IT WAS A HUGE COORDINATION EFFORT AND THEN\nWHEN YOU HAVE THESE THINGS TAKING PLACE AT THE SAME TIME\nTHAT JUST HEIGHTENED EVERYBODY'S AWARENESS.\n>> I'D LIKE TO GET YOUR SENSE OF THINGS SO I'M SURE YOU HEARD OUR\nCORRESPONDENT REPORTING THERE AND WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?\n>> I'M SURE THAT THERE ARE ALL OF THESE INCIDENCES PROPERLY\nBEING WORKED CLOSELY TOGETHER. AND IT'S PROBABLY IN CONSTANT\nCONTACT WITH THE JTTF IN NEW YORK AND THEY'RE PROBABLY\nTRADING IN NEW YORK. ALL OF THEM WILL GO QUICKLY TO\nBE EXAMINED IF FOR COMMONALITIES AND THEY'LL KNOW IT AS QUICKLY\nAS THEY CAN GET IT DOWN THERE. NOBODY WILL REST.\nEVERYBODY WILL BE WORKING ON THIS THING CONSTANTLY BUT AS\nIT'S MOVING FORWARD MORE INCIDENTS KEEP HAPPENING AS WE\nSPEAK SO IT'S GOING TO BE A BUSY TIME.\n>> CERTAINLY AND THE PRESSURE IS ON TO TRY TO BRING THIS TO A\nCONCLUSION. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE FACT\nTHAT THEY HAVE SURVEILLANCE VIDEO.\nTHEY HAVE SOMEONE SUSPICIOUS IN THE VIDEO BUT THEY'RE NOT\nRELEASING IT TO THE PUBLIC FOR ANY HELP.\n>> I THINK THAT MIGHT INDICATE THAT THEY HAVE WHAT THEY FEEL IS\nENOUGH TO PROVIDE THEM WITH WHAT THEY NEED TO IDENTIFY THE PERSON\nSO IN OTHER WORDS YOU ONLY GO OUT TO THE PUBLIC IF YOU NEED TO\nGO OUT TO THE PUBLIC. IF THERE'S ENOUGH IN THAT VIDEO\nFOR THEM TO IDENTIFY THE INDIVIDUAL OR IF THEY CAN TO IT\nIN A LESS PUBLIC WAY, THEY CAN TWO TO CERTAIN PEOPLE THAT THEY\nTHINK MIGHT KNOW THAT INDIVIDUAL THEN THEY CAN DO THAT.\nTHE LESS YOU CAN MAKE PUBLIC IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ADDITIONAL\nCO-CONSPIRATORS IT'S DIFFERENT AT THAT POINT.\n>> I WANT TO GET SOME CONTEXT FROM YOU GIVEN YOUR EXPERIENCE\nIN THIS ARENA. THE PRECISION THAT GOES INTO A\nTRAFFIC STOP THAT HAPPENS ON A BRIDGE, TALK TO US ABOUT THAT.\nAND NO ONE HAS OPINION CHARGED WITH ANYTHING BUT WE DO\nUNDERSTAND THIS IS BEING CON NECKED TO THE SITUATION, THAT\nEXPLOSION IN NEW YORK. >> CLEARLY SOMETHING LEAD THEM\nTO THAT VEHICLE AND THEN THEY GOT ON TO THE VEHICLE AND\nTRAFFIC STOPS ARE ALWAYS A DANGEROUS THING FOR ANY POLICE\nOFFICER TO ENGAGE IN. THE BRIDGE MAY HAVE BEEN THE\nPERFECT TIME TO DO IT BECAUSE YOU HAVE MORE CONTROL OVER WHERE\nTHE CAR IS GOING TO GO. THEY MIGHT HAVE COVERAGE AT BOTH\nENDS OF THE BRIDGE. THEY CAN DELAY TRAFFIC IN THE\nAREA EASILY. MORE EASILY ON A BRIDGE.\nSO IT'S A MORE CONTROLLED VIERLT WHEN YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING LIKE\nTHAT AND THE FACT THAT THE NYPD AND THE FBI WERE DOING IT\nTOGETHER JOINTLY ADDS TO THE SAFETY FACTOR FOR THE OFFICERS\nINVOLVED. >> WE APPRECIATE YOU JOINING US\nTO HELP US UNDERSTAND THIS PROCESS.\nTHANK YOU BOBBY. >> BOBBY, THANK YOU.\nYOU'RE WATCHING CNN NEWSROOM. WE CONTINUE FOLLOWING THE BREAK\nNEWS OUT OF NEW YORK AND OUT OF NEW JERSEY BUT OTHER STORIES\nWE'RE FOLLOWING AND AHEAD THIS HOUR, A THRIVING CITY BEFORE\nTHOUSANDS LEFT IT. WE GO INSIDE OF ALEPPO TO SEE\nHOW SYRIANS THAT STAYED BEHIND THERE ARE HANGING ON.\n>> ALSO AHEAD, AN ARMY BASE COMES UNDER ATTACK WITH DEADLY\nCONSEQUENCES. THIS IS A FLASHPOINT REGION AND\nTHERE IS REASON FOR CONCERN THAT IT IS HEATING UP.\nWE'LL BE BACK WITH THAT AS WELL.                                .", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1474269361202.1474265886910.03bdb9a9-f07e-4d60-b2a8-0543ba9dd396.segment5.thumb.jpg", "channel": "202"}, {"start": 0, "length": 26912.0, "end": 26912, "date": 1474270598784, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1474272736899.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1474270294579-c8ba0480-a1ba-487c-8769-b4e54721fa27-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=0.00,26.91", "text": "JERSEY.\nPOLICE DETONATED A SUSPICIOUS DEVICE FOUND IN A WASTEBASKET IN\nELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY, ABOUT 30 MINUTES OUTSIDE OF MANHATTAN.\nTHE CITY'S MAYOR SAYS AS MANY AS FIVE DEVICES IN ALL WERE\nDISCOVERED IN A BACKPACK AND SAYS THE MEN WHO FOUND IT SAW\nWIRES AND A PIPE AND CONTACTED AUTHORITIES.\nTHE FBI AND STATE POLICE ARE INVESTIGATING.\nTHE DEVICES WERE FOUND NEAR A RAIL LINE, TRAIN SERVICE HAS\nBEEN IMPACTED.", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1474272739479.1474270294579.c8ba0480-a1ba-487c-8769-b4e54721fa27.segment0.thumb.jpg", "channel": "202"}, {"start": 26912, "length": 172472.0, "end": 199384, "date": 1474270598784, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1474272736899.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1474270294579-c8ba0480-a1ba-487c-8769-b4e54721fa27-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=26.91,199.38", "text": ">>> DEBORAH FEYERICK IS TRACKING\nDEVELOPMENTS IN NEW YORK FOR US. >> FIRST LET'S GO TO CNN'S\nRACHEL CRANE LIVE IN ELIZABETH IS, NEW JERSEY WITH DETAILS ON\nTHE DEVICES FOUND THERE.

SO THEY WALKED TO THE POLICE\nSTATION AROUND THE CORNER TO NOTIFY AUTHORITIES.\nONCE IT WAS DETERMINED TO BE A BOMB, THAT PROMPTED NEW JERSEY\nTRANSIT TO SUSPEND SERVICE AND AMTRAK TRAINS WERE ALSO HELD AT\nPENN STATION. WE CAN COME BACK OUT HERE LIVE\nAND SHOW YOU THAT, AGAIN, THE POLICE ARE STANDING BY THIS AREA\nRIGHT NOW. BUT TRAINS ON THE NORTHEAST\nCORNER AS WELL AS THE NORTH JERSEY COASTLINE RAILWAY,\nSERVICE HAS BEEN RESTORED AT THIS HOUR.\nTRAINS ARE RUNNING WITH DELAYS.

WHAT ARE YOUR SOURCES TELLING\nYOU? >> Reporter: I THINK WHAT'S\nINTERESTING IS WHAT ISN'T KNOWN FOR SURE.\nTHE GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK EARLIER TODAY SAID THAT HE HAS BEEN TOLD\nTHAT IT APPEARS THAT THE DEVICE ON 23rd STREET WAS A PRESSURE\nCOOKER LIKE THE ONE ON 27th. THE POLICE CHIEF AND THE FBI\nDIRECTOR DIDN'T WANT TO GO THERE AT THIS NEWS CONFERENCE.\nIT'S NOT CLEAR TO US AT THIS POINT WHETHER THEY KNOW THAT FOR\nSURE. PART OF THE PROBLEM IS, OUR\nUNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE PIECES THAT ARE BEING RECOVERED FROM\nTHE 23rd STREET LOCATION, THE DUMPSTER BOMB, ARE BEING SENT TO\nTHE FBI'S LAB IN QUANTICO. YOU WANT TO COMPARE THAT WITH\nWHAT'S FOUND ON 27th STREET. OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT DEVICE\nHASN'T BEEN SENT TO QUANTICO YET, BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT\nSEND IT TO QUANTICO AND PUT IT ON AN AIRPLANE TO FLY IT DOWN\nHERE UNTIL THEY KNOW IT'S SAFE. THEY ARE WORKING ON THAT.\nTHE BOMB TECHS HERE THAT WOULD MAKE THAT COMPARISON HAVEN'T\nDONE IT YET. IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO SAY THAT.\nSECONDLY, IT'S INTERESTING THAT THE POLICE STILL AREN'T SURE\nEXACTLY WHERE THE 23nd STREET BOMB WAS PLACED.\nTHE SUPPOSITION IS THAT IT WAS PUT IN THE DUMPSTER.\nBUT YOU HEARD THE POLICE CHIEF -- THE POLICE COMMISSIONER\nSAY THEY CANNOT SAY THAT WITH 100% CERTAINTY.\nTHE ASSUMPTION IS IT'S IN THE DUMPSTER.\nBUT THEY DON'T KNOW THAT FOR SURE.\nTHERE'S A LOT THEY DON'T KNOW YET.\nLET'S SAY WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING AT?\nI THOUGHT ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING THINGS WAS WHAT WE\nWERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER HERE. ABOUT THE INTEREST IN\nSURVEILLANCE VIDEO. IT HADN'T OCCURRED TO ME UNTIL\nTHEY SAID IT IS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS FROM GETTING VIDEO IS\nTHAT SOME OF THE CAMERAS ARE OWNED BY BUSINESSES THAT AREN'T\nOPEN ON SUNDAY. THEY ARE HAVING TO WAIT UNTIL\nTHE BUSINESSES OPEN OR I SUSPECT THE NYPD IS TRYING TO CONTACT\nTHEM TO OPEN UP AND GIVE THEM VIDEO.\nTHEY HAVE VIDEO FROM CAMERAS THAT WERE TRAINED ON THE\nLOCATION WHERE THE DUMPSTER IS. WHAT THEY WANT TO DO IS IF THEY\nSEE SOMEBODY WALKING IN, FOR EXAMPLE, AND THROWING SOMETHING\nIN THERE, THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT OTHER SURVEILLANCE\nCAMERAS THAT WOULD FOLLOW THE MOVEMENT OF THE PEOPLE IN AND\nOUT. THE SAME THING WITH WHAT\nHAPPENED ON 27th STREET. THEY WERE PRETTY EXPLICIT ABOUT\nTHAT. WE HAVE SEEN THAT TECHNIQUE\nSUCCESSFULLY APPLIED BEFORE, MOST NOTABLY WITH THE WORK THAT\nLED UP TO THE NAMING OF THE BOSTON MARATHON SUSPECTS FROM\nTHE BOMBINGS. THAT'S A KEY THING THAT THEY\nWILL BE ABLE TO DO. IT'S INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT\nTHEY ARE HAVING TROUBLE GETTING ALL THE INDIVIDUAL R VIDEO BECAS\nARE CLOSED. THEY WILL LOOK AT WHAT'S IN THE\nBOMBINGS. WHAT WAS THE EXPLOSIVE MATERIAL?\nTHAT'S ANOTHER COMMONALITY THEY WILL LOOK FOR WAS THE SAME TYPE\nOF EXPLOSIVE MATERIAL USED. WE DON'T KNOW.\nFOR A FACT THERE WAS EXPLOSIVE MATERIAL IN THE DEVICE FOUND ON\n27th. THE ASSUMPTION IS THERE IS.\nUNTIL THEY KNOW FOR SURE, WE CAN'T SAY UNTIL THEY GET A LOOK\nAT IT AND CAN ANALYZE IT. THAT IS THE WORK THAT WOULD BE\nDONE HERE AT QUANTICO. AS FOR NEW JERSEY, THAT BOMB\nPLACED IN THE GARBAGE CAN YESTERDAY MORNING, THOSE WERE\nTHREE GALVANIZED STEEL PIPES TAPED TOGETHER.\nONLY ONE OF WHICH WENT OFF. THAT ONE ONLY PARTIALLY.\nTHERE'S EVIDENCE THERE. THE UNDERSTANDING IS THAT'S ON\nTHE WAY TO QUANTICO. THERE'S A LOT FOR THE TECHES TO\nLOOK AT. UNTIL THEY CAN GET REALLY INTO\nTHE WEEDS ON THIS, THEY CAN'T SAY WHETHER THESE EVENTS ARE ALL\nCONNECTED TO EACH OTHER. OF COURSE, THEY ARE A LONG WAY\nOF SAYING WHO DID IT. >> PETE, I THINK WHAT YOU\nBROUGHT WAS A SAGE POINT AT THE TOP EXPLAINING WHY WE DON'T YET\nUNDERSTAND IF THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THAT PRESSURE\nCOOKER THAT WAS FOUND ON 27th STREET.\nTHEY LITERALLY HAVE TO GET THIS DEVICE TO QUANTICO SAFELY.\nA PLANE -- YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT IT ON A PLANE.\nTHAT CAN ENDANGER PEOPLE. >> THEY WOULD FLY IT DOWN HERE.\nONE OF THE THINGS WE LEARNED ABOUT THE BOSTON MARATHON\nBOMBING INVESTIGATION IS THEY HAD TWO FLIGHTS A DAY FROM\nBOSTON TO QUANTICO. A MASSIVE COLLECTION OF\nEVIDENCE. THAT, OF COURSE, WAS TWO BOMBING\nSCENES AND THEN ULTIMATELY THE SHOOTING SCENE SEVERAL DAYS\nLATER. THAT WAS A HUGE THING.\nTHINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT IN BOSTON, PIECES OF THE BOMB WERE\nFOUND ON TOP OF BUILDINGS. THEY ARE SAYING NOW THEY ARE\nTRYING TO GET INTO THE BUILDINGS AROUND WHERE THE BOMB WENT OFF\nON 23rd STREET. THEY ARE A LONG WAY FROM KNOWING\nTHAT THEY HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL THE POTENTIAL PIECES OF\nEVIDENCE. BUT ISTRUT  -- SHUTTING THEM DOWN HERE\nQUICKLY. >> LET'S GO TO TAMMY AT POLICE\nHEADQUARTERS.TAKEAWAYS WERE WHA? >> Reporter: THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A\nSENSE OF URGENCY, FIGURING OUT WHO DID THIS.\nTHE MAYOR SAID THEY ARE GOING TO GO SLOWLY.\nTHEY ARE GOING TO BE METHODICAL. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO JUMP TO\nANY CONCLUSIONS. THEY NEED TO FIRST ESTABLISH A\nMOTIVATION. WAS IT POLITICAL?\nWAS IT PERSONAL? HE SAID THEY WILL KEEP US\nAPPRISED WITH REGULAR UPDATES. ALSO, THEY HAVE SOME OF THE TOP\nINVESTIGATORS HERE IN NEW YORK. THEY ARE SAYING, WE'RE COUNTING\nON YOU NEW YORKERS TO HELP US OUT.\nIF YOU HAVE PICTURES, IF YOU HAVE VIDEO, IF YOU OVERHEARD\nANYTHING, PLEASE CONTACT POLICE AND LET THEM KNOW.\nLET'S LISTEN IN TO MORE OF WHAT HE SAID.\n>> WE KNOW THERE WAS A BOMBING. THAT MUCH WE DO KNOW.\nWE KNOW IT'S A VERY SERIOUS INCIDENT.\nBUT WE HAVE A LOT MORE WORK TO DO TO BE ABLE TO SAY WHAT KIND\nOF MOTIVATION WAS BEHIND THIS. WAS IT A POLITICAL MOTIVATION,\nPERSONAL MOTIVATION? WE DO NOT KNOW THAT YET.\nYOU WILL SEE A SUBSTANTIAL NYPD PRESENCE THIS WEEK.\nBIGGER THAN EVER. WE WOULD NORMALLY HAVE AN\nEXPANDED PRESENCE FOR THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY.\nYOU WILL SEE AN EVEN STRONGER PRESENCE NOW.\n>> Reporter: THAT EXTRA PRESENCE IS AN EXTRA 1,000 STATE POLICE\nOFFICERS AND NATIONAL GUARD. THEY WILL BE STATIONED AT\nAIRPORTS, METRO STATIONS, BUS STOPS.\nTHEY ARE GOING TO BE VIGILANT AND LOOKING FOR ANYTHING.\n>> YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW VIGILANT THEY WILL BE.\nTHE SURVEILLANCE VIDEO, THAT WAS SOMETHING WE SPOKEN ABOUT\nEARLIER. I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE\nSUBMITTING WHAT THEY HAVE.  OF THE BUSINESSES ARE CLOSED\nSUNDAY. DO YOU GET A SENSE THAT IS\nPROBABLY THE KEY MISSING LINK TO SOLVING THIS?\nTHAT BEING ABLE TO GO OVER AND OVER THESE TAPES AND PIECE THEM\nTOGETHER LITERALLY FRAME BY FRAME?\nTHAT'S WHAT WILL BRING THE MOST INFORMATION AND PROGRESS IN THE\nINVESTIGATION? >> Reporter: THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A\nKEY PART OF IT. WE NOW KNOW THEY HAVE\nSURVEILLANCE VIDEO ALREADY. EVEN THOUGH SOME OF THE\nBUSINESSES ARE CLOSED, THEY HAVE VIDEO FROM BOTH SCENES.\nWE KNOW THAT FIRST SCENE ON 23rd WHERE THE EXPLOSION ACTUALLY\nHAPPENED, AS WE MENTIONED, THEY HAVE VIDEO OF A PERSON PUTTING\nSOMETHING IN THE DUMPSTER BEFORE THE EXPLOSION HAPPENED.\nSO THAT OBVIOUSLY IS GOING TO BE KEY TO EXAMINE THAT, FIGURE OUT\nWHAT THE PERSON WAS DOING, IF HE IS INVOLVED.\nALSO, ANYBODY ELSE THAT MAY HAVE SHOT VIDEO IN THE AREA.\nTHAT COULD BE KEY, TOO. THAT'S WHY THEY'RE ASKING\nANYBODY TO COME FORWARD WITH ANY PICTURES OR VIDEO.\n>> TAMMY, IN DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN, THANK YOU FOR THAT.\nJOINING ME NOW IS MICHAEL BALBONI.\nGOOD TO SEE YOU.

WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?\n>> OBVIOUSLY, THEY ARE LOOKING AT WHAT WERE THE DETAILS OF THIS\nPARTICULAR BOMBING AS THEY DEVELOPED.\nIT'S SO DIFFICULT TO BE ABLE TO DESCRIBE MOTIVATION IN THE EARLY\nMOMENTS OF THESE TYPES OF INVESTIGATIONS.\nALSO, THOUGH THIS FITS INTO A LOT OF PLAYBOOKS -- PEOPLE ARE\nTALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE'S A LOW GRADE EXPLOSION\nPOSSIBLY USED LIKE GUNPOWDER. OR BLACK POWDER, LIKE THEY DID\nIN THE BOSTON MARATHON. IT'S A PRESSURE COOKER, WHICH IS\nFROM \"INSPIRE\" MAGAZINE. ALL THOSE THINGS SAY, YEP, THIS\nCOULD BE A PART OF A LARGER MOTIF OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM\nOR HOME GROWN RADICALIZATION. YOU GO TO 27th STREET AND 23rd\nSTREET? WHAT IS ICONIC ABOUT THOSE\nAREAS? ON A SATURDAY NIGHT WITH NEW\nYORKERS ALL ABOUT, COULD YOU HAVE PICKED OTHER PLACES.\nPARK A PATHFINDER IN TIMES SQUARE.\nWAS THERE A MESSAGE? WAS IT ACTIVE?\nTHAT'S THE QUESTIONS THAT SAY IT WASN'T AN INTERNATIONAL EFFORT.\n>> BUT, THAT SAID, IT CANNOT BE RULED OUT BECAUSE IT'S EARLY ON\nIN THE INVESTIGATION. >> ABSOLUTELY.\nOBVIOUSLY, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED IN THE EVENINGS\nWHEN YOU DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THIS\nPARTICULAR AREA. IT WAS PERHAPS AN OPPORTUNITY.\nTHAT'S WHAT -- THESE FOLKS TRY TO LOOK FOR IS A WAY TO SUCCEED.\nTHEY'RE NOT GOING TO GO TO A WELL-ARMED, WELL-GUARDED SITE.\nTHEY WILL PICK SOMETHING THAT'S MUCH MORE VULNERABLE.\nTHAT'S WHAT HAPPENED HERE. WE TALK ABOUT THE VIDEO.\nI WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT IN 2007, WE HAD THE BOMBING OF THE\nTIMES SQUARE RECRUITING CENTER. THAT INDIVIDUAL, THOUGH OBSERVED\nBY FOLKS AT THE SCENE AT THE TIME WEARING A HOODIE AND RIDING\nA BIKE, THAT INDIVIDUAL WAS NEVER CAUGHT.\nI THINK IN THIS DAY AND AGE OF ALL THE SHOWS LIKE \"24\" AND\n\"CSI,\" WE EXPECT THE VIDEO TO BE A POINT OF REFERENCE THAT LEADS\nUS TO A SUSPECT. YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH IT AND\nMAKE SURE YOU HAVE RELEVANT PIECES.\n>> LET'S LOOK AT BIG PICTURE HERE.\nWE HAVE THE EXPLOSIONS IN NEW YORK, THE ONE IN NEW JERSEY AS\nWELL. WE HAD IN MINNESOTA A MAN\nSTABBED EIGHT PEOPLE AT A SHOPPING MALL AFTER POLICE SAY\nHE MADE REFERENCE TO ALLAH. SO FAR AUTHORITIES SAY THERE ARE\nNOT ANY CONNECTIONS. HOW CAN THEY BE SURE?\n>> IT'S A PROBLEM WITH ASYMMETRIC TERRORISM.\nWE'RE IN THE AGE OF EVENTS THAT HAPPEN NOT NECESSARILY COORDINATED.\nNOT LIKE THE 9/11 ATTACKS. THERE IS THIS CONSTANT CALL\nTHROUGH PUBLICATIONS AND OTHER TYPES OF MESSAGING FROM THE\nCENTRAL LEADERSHIP OF ISIS AND AL QAEDA TO GO BRING THE BATTLE\nTO AMERICA. BRING IT OUT THERE IN THEIR\nSTREETS. SO YOU DON'T KNOW WHO IS GOING\nTO BE RADICALIZED AND WHEN IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.\nWE SAW THAT OBVIOUSLY IN SAN BERNARDINO.\nWE SAW IT IN ORLANDO. WE SAW IT IN BOSTON.\nTHIS IS REALLY WHAT -- WHEN THE  NIGHTMARE, IT'S RIGHT.\nEVERYBODY IN SECURITY HAS BEEN  IT PUTS PRESSURE ON THE NYPD,\nPROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST IF NOT THE BEST ARMED FORCE IN THE\nUNITED STATES AND POSSIBLY THE WORLD.\n>> THANK. MICHAEL, MANY THANKS FOR YOUR\nINSIGHT. WE WILL TALK A SHORT BREAK.\nWE WILL LOOK AT THE HEIGHTENED SECURITY RIGHT THERE AT THAT\nBUILDING. THAT'S THE UNITED NATIONS.\nTHE U.N.

TIME FOR LEADERSHIP.\nWHERE'S OUR LEADER? >> LISTEN, I THINK THE PRESIDENT\nWILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THIS LATER TODAY.\nWHAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON IS MAKING SURE WE'RE LETTING THE FEDERAL\nINVESTIGATORS WHO ARE ON THE JOB LEAD THE COURSE OF THIS\nINVESTIGATION AND FOLLOW THE FACTS AND GET TO THE BOTTOM OF\nEXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENED. THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY WORKING\nTHROUGH THE NIGHT. WE SAW FIRST RESPONDERS RESPOND\nHEROICALLY ON SATURDAY NIGHT TO SAVE LIVES AND LOOK OUT FOR\nINNOCENT PEOPLE. OUR INVESTIGATORS ARE CONTINUING\nTO DO REALLY GOOD WORK TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF WHAT EXACTLY\nHAPPENED HERE. THE PRESIDENT'S FULLY SUPPORTING\nTHEM. HE'S THE ONE THAT'S IN THE LOOP\nBEING UPDATED ON THIS REGULARLY. BUT LOOK CHRIS THIS RAISES A\nBUNCH OF BROADER QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO MAKE SURE\nWE'RE KEEPING THE COUNTRY SAFE AND PROTECTING --\n>> IS THIS A REFLECTION OF A REALITY THAT WE ARE NOT SAFE?\nTHAT THIS CELL WAS ABLE, IF IT IS A CELL, YOU KNOW, THIS IS\nVERY EARLY IN THE INVESTIGATION. >> RIGHT.\n>> BUT IF THERE WAS SOME NUMBER OF PEOPLE PLANNING TO DO HARM,\nAND THEY WENT UNDETECTED, IF THIS CAN JUST HAPPEN AND IT\nCAN'T BE STOPPED ON, YOU KNOW, EVERY TIME, OBVIOUSLY, IS IT A\nREFLECTION OF THE FACT THAT WE'RE NOT THAT SAFE?\n>> NO I THINK WE ARE SAFE. AND THERE'S NO DENYING AFTER 15\nYEARS WE JUST OBSERVED THE ANNIVERSARY OF 9/11, OUR COUNTRY\nIS MUCH BETTER EQUIPPED TO PREVENT THOSE KINDS OF ATTACKS.\nTHAT IS A TESTAMENT TO OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN THE MILITARY WHO\nHAVE WORKED VERY HARD OVERSEAS TO APPLY PRESSURE TO TERRORIST\nORGANIZATIONS THAT WANT TO DO HARM TO THE UNITED STATES.\nIN FACT JUST EARLIER THIS MONTH THE UNITED STATES MILITARY TOOK\nTWO DIFFERENT STRIKES AGAINST SENIOR ISIL FIGURES.\nTHESE ARE TWO PLOTTERS, ADNANI WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME OF\nTHE PLOTTING IN EUROPE, AND ANOTHER SENIOR EXTERNAL PLOTTER\nFROM ISIL. SO WE'RE CONTINUING TO APPLY\nSIGNIFICANT PRESSURE TO SENIOR LEADERS IN ISIL WHO MIGHT WANT\nTO DO US HARM. THE OTHER THING WE HAVE TO DO\nCHRIS IS WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ONE OF THE OTHER DIFFICULT\nTHINGS TO DO IS TO TRY AND DISRUPT THESE SORT OF LOEP WOLF\nACTIVITIES. IT'S HARD TO GET INSIDE THE MIND\nOF AN INDIVIDUAL. IT'S EASIER TO DISRUPT PLOTS.\nWE HAVE MORE CAPABILITY TO DISRUPT THOSE KINDS OF PLOTS\nTHAN IT IS TO TRY TO DISRUPT AND PREVENT A LONE WOLF.\nTHE PRESIDENT'S ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THAT IS A BIG CHALLENGE.\nSO WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS DHS DO A MUCH BETTER JOB OF WORKING WITH\nONLINE COMPANIES, GOOGLE, TWITTER, FACEBOOK, AND OTHERS\nTHAT ARE COORDINATING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO SHUT DOWN\nTHE CHANNELS THAT WE KNOW THAT ISIL AND OTHER EXTREMIST GROUPS\nARE USING TO PROPAGATE THEIR HATEFUL, BANKRUPT IDEOLOGY.\n>> THE FBI JUST PUT OUT A BOLO, BE ON THE LOOK OUT FOR, JUST SO\nYOU UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS THE URGENCY.\nTHIS IS THE MAN THAT THEY WANT IN CONNECTION WITH WHAT HAPPENED\nIN CHELSEA. THAT EXPLOSIVE DEVICE A PRESSURE\nCOOKER BOMB IT WAS BELIEVED THEY BELIEVE IS CONNECTED IN TERMS OF\nTHE MATERIAL INVOLVED AND TECHNOLOGY INVOLVED WITH BOMBS\nTHAT WERE FOUND ALSO IN NEW JERSEY AND MUTT IMLOCATIONS.\nONE OF THEM WENT OFF DURING A MARINE SPONSORED RACE.\nAHMAD KHAN RAHAMI. 5'6\", ABOUT 200 POUNDS.\nAUTHORITIES WANT YOUR HELP NOT IN APPREHENDING THE SUSPECT THEY\nBELIEVE HE COULD BE ARMED AND DANGEROUS.\nLAST KNOWN ADDRESS ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY SO PEOPLE IN AND\nAROUND THAT AREA BAD GUYS LIKE THIS WHEN THEY'RE ON THE RUN\nTEND TO START VERY CLOSE TO HOME.\nSO IF YOU SEE SOMETHING, CALL. 1-800-577-TIPS.\nNOW THE FACE OF THE MAN ON THIS SCREEN.\nTHE NAME. HE'S A NATURALIZED CITIZEN HERE.\nHE IS FROM AFGHANISTAN. IT RAISES THE SPECTER OF THE\nFEAR, THE XENOPHOBIA OF THOSE WHO ARE GETTING INTO THIS\nCOUNTRY AND WHETHER THEY ARE EFFICIENTLY VETTED IN A WAY THAT\nHAS TO BE DONE. WE KNOW.\nBUT CAN IT BE DONE WELL ENOUGH? THIS IS A BIG, BIG ISSUE IN THIS\nCAMPAIGN. IS THIS A REFLECTION OF NOT\nGETTING IT DONE? >> WELL, CHRIS, I DON'T WANT TO\nSPEAK TO ANY INDIVIDUAL SUSPECTS OR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE WANTED\nRIGHT NOW. WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT WE\nARE, WHEN IT COMES TO ISIL, WE ARE IN A FIGHT, A NARRATIVE\nFIGHT WITH THEM. A NARRATIVE BATTLE.\nAND WHAT ISIL WANTS TO DO IS THEY WANT TO PROJECT THAT THEY\nARE AN ORGANIZATION THAT IS REPRESENTING ISLAM IN A FIGHT\nAND A WAR AGAINST THE WEST, AND A WAR AGAINST THE UNITED STATES.\nTHAT IS A BANKRUPT, FALSE NARRATIVE.\nIT'S A MYTHOLOGY. AND WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS IN\nDEBUNKING THAT MYTHOLOGY. ISIL WAS A GROUP THAT WAS VIEWED\nAS ON THE MOVE AND ON THE MARCH WHEN THEY MADE A BUNCH OF\nPROGRESS IN IRAQ A COUPLE OF SUMMERS AGO.\nBUT SINCE THAT TIME WE HAVE WORKED WITH IRAQI SECURITY\nFORCES. WE'VE TAKEN BACK MORE THAN HALF\nOF THE TERRITORY THAT THEY PREVIOUSLY CONTROLLED.\nWE MADE IMPORTANT PROGRESS INSIDE OF SYRIA TAKING BACK 25%\nOF THE GROUND THEY PREVIOUSLY CONTROLLED THERE.\nWE'VE TAKEN SENIOR ISIL PLOTTERS OFF THE BATTLEFIELD.\nSO WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS IN DEBUNKING THIS MYTHOLOGY THAT\nSOMEHOW ISIL IS WAGING THIS WAR. HERE'S ANOTHER ELEMENT OF THIS\nFIGHT. WE CAN'T PLAY INTO THIS\nNARRATIVE THAT SOMEHOW THE UNITED STATES OR THE WEST IS\nAGAINST -- IS FIGHTING AGAINST THE MUSLIM RELIGION.\nTHE FACT IS THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PATRIOTIC MUSLIMS IN THIS\nCOUNTRY RIGHT NOW THAT MAKE OUR COUNTRY PROUD.\nTHEY SERVE IN OUR ARMED SERVICES.\nTHEY SERVE IN OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT.\nTHEY ARE ADOCTORS. THEY ARE TEACHERS.\nTHEY ARE LAWYERS. THEY ARE NURSES.\nTHESE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL, AND POSITIVE\nCONTRIBUTION TO OUR COUNTRY. AND ISIL WOULD RAT -- THAT IS AN\nINCONVENIENT FACT FOR THE ISIL NARRATIVE AND WE CAN'T PAINT\nWITH A BROAD BRUSH. WE CAN'T SUGGEST AND, AND, AND\nHOLD UNDER SUSPICION INDIVIDUALS AS POSSIBLE TERRORISTS JUST\nBECAUSE OF THE OF THE WAY THAT THEY WORSHIP GOD.\nTHAT IS, THAT IS CONTRARY TO WHAT WE BELIEVE AS AMERICANS.\nIT ALSO UNDERMINES OUR FIGHT AGAINST ISIL.\n>> THAT GETS INTO THE A DOING OF THIS ELECTION.\nMANY AS YOU KNOW IN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY BELIEVE\nTHAT OUR CULTURAL ASSIMILATION OF MUSLIMS AND REALLY EVERYBODY\nWHO COMES TO AMERICA IS A BIG REASON WE HAVEN'T SEEN MORE\nHOME-GROWN THREATS AS WE'RE SEEING IN EUROPE NOW THERE ARE\nOTHER FACTORS AS WELL OF COURSE BUT IT GETS US INTO THE DIALOGUE\nOF THIS ELECTION AND THERE DOES SEEM TO BE THIS TENSION BETWEEN\nDO WE COME TOGETHER OR DO WE EXACERBATE WHAT IS APART?\nPRESIDENT OBAMA WEIGHED IN IN AN INTERESTING WAY.\nHE WAS SPEAKING TO AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS.\nAND HE SAID, BASICALLY, I WOULD SEE IT AS AN INSULT TO MY LEGACY\nIF BLACK VOTERS DON'T COME OUT FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHAT IS UNUSUALLY STRONG LANGUAGE FOR HIM AND IT'S AN\nUNUSUAL MESSAGE. IT WOULD BE AN INSULT TO MY\nLEGACY IF YOU DON'T COME OUT FOR HER.\nWHAT'S THE IMPACT OF THAT SUPPOSED TO BE FROM HIS\nPERSPECTIVE? >> I THINK THE IMPACT IS TO SEND\nA CLEAR MESSAGE TO THE PRESIDENT'S SUPPORTERS ACROSS\nTHE COUNTRY THAT EVEN THOUGH HIS NAME IS ON THE BALLOT HE FEELS\nPASSIONATELY ABOUT THE OUTCOME OF THIS RACE.\nAND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT IF THEY'RE\nWONDERING. MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN VERY\nDISMAYED AT THE RHETORIC THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE CONTEXT OF\nTHIS POLITICAL DEBATE. A LOT OF PEOPLEVILLE BEEN TURNED\nOFF BY POLITICS BECAUSE OF THE RHETORIC THAT'S BEEN COMING FROM\nTHE REPUBLICAN SIDE AND THERE'S A TENDENCY TO WANT TO JUST SHUT\nIT OUT AND IGNORE IT AND THE PRESIDENT IS SAYING THE STAKES\nARE TOO HIGH. EVEN THOUGH MY NAME IS ON THE --\nIS NOT ON THE BALLOT, THE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE IS\nBECAUSE THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE IS PROMISING TO UNDO ALL OF THAT\nTO ROLL IT ALL BACK SO THE PRESIDENT DESPITE THE FACT THAT\nHE'S NOT ON THE BALLOT FEELS VERY PASSIONATELY ABOUT THE\nOUTCOME OF THIS RACE AND FEELS LIKE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE\nTO BE ENGAGED PARTICULARLY PEOPLE WHO HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY\nBEEN INVOLVED IN POLITICS BUT GOT ENGAGED IN SUPPORT OF HIS\nCAMPAIGN FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME.\nTHE PRESIDENT'S MAKING THE CASE TO THEM THAT THEY SHOULD STAY\nENGAGED. >> JOOSH EARNEST.\nWE KNOW WE'RE EXPECTING THE PRESIDENT.\nHE'S GOING TO SPEAK AT THE G-8 TODAY.\nWE EXPECT TO HEAR WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT THE ONGOING INVESTIGATION\nHERE. WE APPRECIATE YOU GIVING US AN\nADVANCE ON WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR.\n>> APPRECIATE IT. >> ALWAYS A PLEASURE.\nALISYN. >> WHAT WOULD LIBERTARIAN\nCANDIDATE GARY JOHNSON DO ABOUT TERROR THREATS?\nGOVERNOR JOHNSON JOINS US NEXT.", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1474291807452.1474288344638.a86aabc6-a06e-4ad8-88f8-476364a47480.segment3.thumb.jpg", "channel": "202"}, {"start": 0, "length": 376984.0, "end": 376984, "date": 1474290400973, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1474293578641.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1474290141142-846511e7-0c27-4e46-9c93-35de2df338a0-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=0.00,376.98", "text": "JOHNSON.\nGOVERNOR JOHNSON THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.\n>> ALISYN, THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME ON.\n>> WHAT WOULD PRESIDENT JOHNSON DO ABOUT THE TERROR THREAT OF\nHOME GROWN CELLS? >> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, WHAT\nHAPPENED IN NEW YORK JUST REALLY GLAD THAT NOBODY WAS KILLED.\nHAVING BEEN GOVERNOR OF NEW MEXICO, I'M -- WAS ALWAYS AMAZED\nWITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND JUST HOW QUALIFIED THEY ARE.\nJUST HOW ON THE SCENE THEY ARE. JUST HOW THEY HAVE BETTER IDEAS\nWITH REGARD TO HOW TO GO FORWARD THAN ANYBODY ELSE.\nALREADY THERE IS A SUSPECT THAT'S BEEN IDENTIFIED.\nTO ME WHAT THAT SAYS IS LOOK, WE'VE GOT A SYSTEM THAT IS\nWORKING. OF COURSE, CONSTANTLY YOU'RE\nLOOKING TO IMPROVE ON THINGS IN THIS COUNTRY.\nI WOULD BE OVERSEEING THE IMPROVEMENT THAT OBVIOUSLY COULD\nTAKE PLACE. THE FACT THAT WE INTERVIEWED THE\nFBI INTERVIEWED THE SHOOTER IN ORLANDO ON A COUPLE OF\nOCCASIONS. OBVIOUSLY THE SYSTEM IS WORKING\nUP TO A CERTAIN POINT. BUT THE FBI HAS REAL GOOD IDEAS\nON HOW TO PROCEED THAT THE SHOOTER IN ORLANDO WOULDN'T HAVE\nFALLEN THROUGH THE CRACKS. >> BUT OBVIOUSLY --\n>> SUSPECTS -- >> SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU BUT IT\nDIDN'T WORK -- >> YEAH, RIGHT, RIGHT.\n>> CLEARLY THERE'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED.\n>> WELL, CLEARLY. AND I'LL BET, AND I WISH I HAD\nTHIS INTELLIGENCE, I WOULD LOVE TO SIT DOWN WITH THE FBI RIGHT\nNOW, AND UNDERSTAND FROM THEM WHAT DIRECTION THEY WOULD LIKE\nTO TAKE FORWARD -- THEY WOULD LIKE TO TAKE FORWARD.\nCLEARLY, YOU KNOW, THEY DROPPED THE BALL.\nI WOULD SUSPECT THAT THEY RECOGNIZE THAT BETTER THAN\nANYONE ELSE. AND WE ARE IN A PROCESS HERE.\nAND WE ALL HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO YOU KNOW, TO SEE THESE\nTHREATS, TO SEE ACTIONS LIKE THIS NOT OCCUR IN THE FUTURE.\n>> YEAH. >> BUT IT'S REALLY A\nCOLLABORATIVE EFFORT AND AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,\nYOU KNOW, YOU'RE GOING TO BE THE ARBITER IN CHIEF OVER ALL OF\nTHIS. AND IT'S WHY I -- IT'S WHY I'M\nSEEKING THE JOB. I JUST -- I JUST FOUND IT TO BE\nINCREDIBLY CHALLENGING, INTERESTING, AND INTERESTING\nFROM THE STANDPOINT OF ALWAYS TRYING TO MAKE THINGS BETTER.\n>> YEAH. >> I MEAN THAT'S AS HUMANKIND.\nAS CITIZENS OF THIS COUNTRY. >> YEAH.\n>> THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO SEE. >> BUT, BUT, BUT, GOVERNOR WHAT\nYOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS BEING REACTIVE, THE FBI DOING A BETTER\nINVESTIGATION ONCE THEY GET A TIP OR ONCE SOMETHING HAPPENS\nLIKE A BOMBING. WHAT ABOUT STAMPING OUT ISIS\nIDEOLOGY? WHAT'S THE PLAN FOR THAT?\n>> WELL, THAT IT IS TAKING PLACE.\nTHAT WE DO HAVE MILLIONS OF MUSLIMS THAT LIVE IN THIS\nCOUNTRY THAT ARE CONTRIBUTING MEMBERS IN THIS COUNTRY, LOOK I\nTHINK THAT WE ARE -- I THINK IT STARTED WITH REGIME CHANGE AT\nTHE VERY BEGINNING, AND WHY IS THIS THE CASE TO BEGIN WITH?\nBUT YOU KNOW, LOOKING AT THE SOURCE, LOOKING AT LONE WOFLS, I\nHATE THAT TERM, BUT LOOKING AT INSPIRED ISIS ATTACKS, YOU KNOW,\nARE WE EVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO PREVENT THAT?\nWELL, WE SHOULD CERTAINLY BE ENGAGED IN TRYING TO MAKE THAT\nHAPPEN. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS SO MUCH\nREACTIVE. I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT\nOF PRO-ACTION GOING ON AND IN OUR CASE, YOU KNOW, MORE\nPRO-ACTION THAT WE SHOULD SET UP A TASK FORCE, AN ENHANCED TASK\nFORCE TO ACTUALLY DEAL WITH POTENTIAL TIPS, AND HOW THERE\nWOULD BE A FOLLOW-UP. LOOK, RESOURCES, DIRECT\nRESOURCES IN AREAS THAT ARE GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE, TAKE\nRESOURCES AWAY IN AREAS THAT AREN'T MAKING ANY DIFFERENCE.\n>> GOVERNOR I WANT TO TALK ABOUT YOUR CAMPAIGN.\nYOU DID NOT -- YOU FOUND OUT THIS WEEKEND YOU DID NOT QUALIFY\nFOR THE FIRST DEBATE STAGE. I KNOW THAT THAT WAS A BIG BLOW\nTO YOU. YOU HAD BEEN HOPING TO GET\nTHERE. THERE ARE ALSO REPORTS THAT YOUR\nRUNNING MATE, VP NOMINEE BILL WELD IS CONSIDERING ACTUALLY\nDROPPING OFF TT TICKET. BECAUSE HE'S CONCERNED AT THIS\nPOINT THAT A VOTE FOR BOTH OF YOU WOULD DENY HILLARY CLINTON A\nVOTE AND THEREFORE HELP ELECT DONALD TRUMP.\nCAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT? >> WELL, YOU KNOW, THAT I'M\nPOLLING HIGHER RIGHT NOW THAN ROSS PEROT WAS WHEN HE WAS\nINVITED TO DO THE FIRST DEBATE. AND LET'S REMEMBER THAT AT A\nPOINT HE WAS ACTUALLY LEADING IN THE POLLS TO BECOME PRESIDENT\nBEFORE A WHOLE BUNCH OF STUFF HAPPENED OF WHICH I COULDN'T\nEVEN OFFER YOU AN EXPLANATION. HIM DROPPING OUT.\n>> SURE. >> HIM COMING BACK IN.\nNO BILL WELD IS IN THIS FOR THE LONG HAUL.\nAND BEYOND MY WILDEST DREAMS BILL WELD IS MY RUNNING MATE AND\nLOOK, WE DON'T THINK EITHER SIDE OFFICE THE ALTERNATIVE THAT\nAMERICANS REALLY WANT. AND IT'S A COMBINATION OF BEING\nFISCALLY CONSERVATIVE. SMALL GOVERNMENT.\nI DON'T THINK HILLARY OFFERS THAT.\nI THINK BILL IS REALLY CONCERNED THAT HILLARY IS GOING TO GROW\nGOVERNMENT, TAXES ARE GOING TO GO UP, AND THAT THERE HAS BEEN\nPAY TO PLAY. THERE'S BEEN PAY TO PLAY AND\nREALLY BIG QUESTIONS ON THESE E-MAILS THAT FOR BILL WELD HAVE\nRECENTLY BEEN RAISED. SO, NO.\nNO CHANCE BILL WELD DROPS OUT. WE'RE IN THIS FOR THE LONG HAUL.\nWE STILL THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO WIN.\nOF COURSE IT WOULD BE TO BE IN THESE LAST COUPLE OF DEBATES.\n>> YEAH. >> YOU KNOW, THE FACT THAT I\nDIDN'T HAVE TO DO THE FIRST DEBATE, GOSH, AND STILL GET\nELECTED, MAYBE THAT WILL END UP TO BE A POSITIVE.\nLESS WORK, HUH? >> I LIKE THE SILVER LINING.\nGOVERNOR GARY JOHNSON.

NOT LONE WOLF ATTACKS BUT\nPOSSIBLY THIS ORGANIZED GROUP. IF THAT'S TRUE, THEN WE'RE\nTALKING ABOUT A COORDINATED TERROR ATTACK BY A GROUP OF\nPEOPLE WORKING TOGETHER. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT.\nDAVID RHODES IS A CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST.\nTOMB L TOM FUENTES IS FORMER FBI ASSISTANT DIRECTOR AND ART\nRODERICK IS FORMER ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF THE U.S. MARSHAL\nSERVICE. WELCOME TO ALL OF YOU.\nSO DAVID, IF THIS IS A CELL, HOW WORRIED SHOULD WE BE?\n>> WELL, THE FACT THAT THEY'VE RELEASED, YOU KNOW, THE\nSUSPECT'S NAME, MEANS THEY'RE TRYING TO DRIVE HIM UNDERGROUND,\nMAYBE SPOOK THEM, BLOCK THEM FROM CARRYING OUT SOME KIND OF\nFOLLOW-UP ATTACK. BUT JUST THE NUMBER OF DEVICES\nTHAT HAVE BEEN FOUND, IT'S CLEARLY VERY ALARMING.\nYOU KNOW, IN TERMS OF THE FOREIGN CONNECTION, IT'S NOT\nCLEAR. HE'S AN AFGHAN BUT MY SUSPICION\nIF IT'S ANY FOREIGN TIE IT'S TO ISIS AND SYRIA ITSELF.\nTHIS WILL BE MORE A CASE OF A YOUNG -- HE SEEMS LIKE HE HAD\nVERY LITTLE -- SPENT VERY LITTLE PART OF HIS LIFE IN AFGHANISTAN.\nSO MAYBE A GROUP THAT RADICALIZED ONLINE.\nTHE WORST CASE WOULD BE IF SOMEONE HAD TRAINING IN SYRIA,\nAND CAME BACK. THAT WOULD GIVE THEM, YOU KNOW,\nBETTER SKILLS TO CARRY OUT THE ATTACK.\n>> HERE'S SOMETHING THAT IS KIND OF CONFUSING.\nTHERE'S THIS TERRIBLE STABBING SPREE AT A MALL IN MINNESOTA,\nRIGHT? ISIS CLAMD RESPONSIBILITY FOR\nTHAT. BUT WE HAVEN'T HEARD A PEEP OUT\nOF ISIS AS IT CONCERNS NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY.\nWHY WOULD THAT BE, DAVID? >> IT'S ODD.\nYOU WOULD THINK THAT ISIS WOULD SORT OF LEAP AT THE CHANCE TO\nGET CREDIT FOR THIS. SO THERE'S A CHANCE THAT ISIS IS\nNOT DIRECTING THE CELL IN NEW YORK.\nAGAIN THERE HAS BEEN THIS, YOU KNOW, WE'VE SEEN THIS STREAM OF\nATTACKS AND IT CAN BE, YOU KNOW, TWO OR THREE LONE WOLVES WHO\nSOMEHOW GOT TOGETHER AND RADICALIZED ONLINE.\nTO BE FAIR, NOT TO ALARM PEOPLE, WE DON'T KNOW.\nLAW ENFORCEMENT KNOWS BUT I CERTAINLY DON'T KNOW AT THIS\nPOINT. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT LAW\nENFORCEMENT KNOWS. MAYOR de BLASIO SAYS THIS\nSUSPECT THAT EVERYBODY'S LOOKING FOR HERE IN NEW YORK CITY IS A\n28-YEAR-OLD NEW JERSEY RESIDENT. HE'S A NATURALIZED CITIZEN.\nSOME PEOPLE THINK HE MAY BE THE BOMBMAKER.\nDO THEY SUSPECT THAT BECAUSE OF THE EVIDENCE THEY FOUND ON THE\nSCENE OF THAT UNEXPLODED PRESSURE COOKER AND THE CELL\nPHONE THEY FOUND? >> WELL THAT'S VERY STRONG\nPOSSIBILITY, CAROL. BUT YOU KNOW, THIS INDIVIDUAL,\nAND OTHERS ASSOCIATED WITH HIM MIGHT HAVE ALREADY BEEN UNDER\nINVESTIGATION. YOU KNOW THE FBI HAS SAID IT HAS\nABOUT 1,000 COUNTERTERRORISM INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM\nINVESTIGATIONS ONGOING IN ALL 50 STATES.\nSO IT COULD BE THAT HIS NAME HAS COME UP BEFORE, AND JUST WHEN\nTHESE DEVICES WENT THEY MIGHT HAVE SUSPECTED HIM OR OTHERS\nASSOCIATED WITH HIM. AND THEN SAW THE FACE IN THE\nVIDEO FROM THE OTHER NIGHT, AND PUT IT TOGETHER THAT IT MIGHT BE\nHIM. ALSO YOU MIGHT HAVE DATA FROM\nTHE VEHICLES COMING AND GOING FROM NEW JERSEY BECAUSE THEY\nWOULD HAVE GONE THROUGH TOLL GATE PLAZAS, TUNNEL PLAZAS, UP\nAND DOWN THE STREETS OF NEW JERSEY AND NEW YORK AND WOULD\nHAVE COME UNDER SEVERAL TRAFFIC CAMERAS, AND MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN,\nYOU KNOW, NOTICED BY THAT. AND WE KNOW THE POLICE AND FBI\nWERE SEARCHING THE SUBARU THAT WAS FOUND YESTERDAY.\nTHEY WERE LOOKING AT THAT. SO THAT'S AMONG THE\nPOSSIBILITIES. AND IT'S ALSO A POSSIBILITY THAT\nTHE FBI KNOWS WHERE HE'S AT AND MAY HAVE ALREADY HAD HIM UNDER\nSURVEILLANCE IN THE LAST DAY OR TWO, AND THEY'RE TRYING TO LINE\nUP OTHERS THAT ARE SECRETARIED WITH HIM, TRYING TO GET THE\nWHOLE GROUP AS OPPOSED TO JUST ONE GUY AND THE OTHER GROUP\nSCATTERS. SO THERE'S A LOT OF\nPOSSIBILITIES TO THESE KIND OF INVESTIGATIONS BEHIND THE SCENES\nTHAT YOU JUST DON'T KNOW ABOUT NOW WILL COME OUT LATER IN THE\nFACTS. >> SO ART, THE NEW YORK POLICE\nDEPARTMENT IS HOLDING OVER THE OVERNIGHT SHIFT, IT'S ADDING\nPATROLS TO THE CITY TRANSIT SYSTEM.\nALL OF THAT SOUNDS OMINOUS BUT I SUPPOSE THEY JUST WANT TO KEEP\nPEOPLE SAFE. THEY WANT TO CHECK PEOPLE'S BAGS\nTHROUGHOUT THE CITY AND THEY ALSO WANT THE PUBLIC'S HELP.\nSO WHAT CAN THE PUBLIC DO? >> WELL I MEAN OBVIOUSLY IF, YOU\nKNOW, THEY'VE PUT OUT THE WANTED POSTER.\nTHERE'S A TON OF INFORMATION THAT THEY KNOW THAT WE DON'T\nKNOW YET THAT'S TRICKLING OUT VERY SHORTLY.\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW THE JOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCES ARE SET\nUP, NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY, YOU HAVE MULTIPLE AGENCIES THAT COME\nTOGETHER. THIS IS EXACTLY THE TYPE OF CASE\nTHAT THEY WERE BUILT TO DO. SO YOU'VE GOT ALL THESE FEDERAL\nAGENCIES, STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES THAT COME TOGETHER,\nBRING ALL THIS DIFFERENT KIND OF EXPERTISE.\nYOU HAVE FBI WITH COUNTERTERRORISM, YOU HAVE U.S.\nMARSHALS, WHO ARE EXPERTS AT TRACKING INDIVIDUALS, AND\nLOCATING FUGITIVES. YOU HAVE ATF WHICH ARE THE BOMB\nEXPERTS. YOU HAVE I.C.E. THAT HAVE\nOVERSEAS CONNECTIONS. NEW JERSEY STATE POLICE.\nWHEN YOU PUT THE TWO JTTFs TOGETHER THERE'S A LOT OF\nCAPABILITY HERE. THEY'RE WAY DOWN THE LINE IN\nWHAT INFORMATION THEY'RE PASSING ON TO US.\nI THINK PROBABLY ONE OF THE COMMENTS EARLIER, THAT NOW\nTHEY'RE PUTTING OUT THIS INFORMATION, THEY PROBABLY HAD\nTHIS INDIVIDUAL WE'RE LOOKING AT HIM FOR THE PAST 48 HOURS,\nBEFORE THEY PUT THIS INFORMATION OUT.\nSOME OF THE LEADS MIGHT HAVE DRIED UP BUT THIS IS MOVING VERY\nFAST AS FAR AS IF YOU'RE INVOLVED IN THOSE TWO JTTFs AND\nINFORMATION IS BEING SHARD ACROSS LINES.\nONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS IS YOU'VE GOT PIPE BOMBS THAT ARE\nBEING DISCOVERED HERE IN NEW JERSEY IN THESE TWO SEPARATE\nINCIDENTS IN SEASIDE AND UP IN ELIZABETH.\nAND YET YOU'VE GOT PRESSURE COOKERS UP IN NEW YORK, WHICH\nINDICATES TO ME THAT WE'VE GOT A VERY GOOD POSSIBILITY OF MORE\nTHAN ONE BOMBMAKER. BUT QUITE A FEW INDIVIDUALS\nINVOLVED IN THIS CONSPIRACY. >> AND JUST A LAST QUESTION TO\nYOU, DAVID, BECAUSE SOMETHING ELSE CONFUSES ME.\nSO, THEY PUT PIPE BOMBS IN TRASH CANS.\nSOME OF THEM UNEXPLODED. AND, AND IN CHELSEA THEY PUT,\nTHEY PUT THE SUPPOSEDLY A PRESSURE COOKER BOMB IN A BIG\nGARBAGE BIN WHICH WOULD KIND OF CONTAIN THE DAMAGE, RIGHT?\nIT WOULDN'T HURT AS MANY PEOPLE. AND THEN THEY FIND THAT ONE\nUNEXPLODED. WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU ABOUT\nTHE SKILL OF THESE SUSPECTS? >> THERE ARE, YOU KNOW,\nQUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR SKILL WHICH YOU POINT OUT ARE GOOD\nTHINGS. THE FACT THAT THEY DUMPED\nTHESE -- THE BOMBS LAST NIGHT IN ELIZABETH IS A GOOD SIGN.\nTHEY'RE SORT OF ON THE RUN IT SEEMS.\nTHEY'RE NOT ORGANIZED, NOT PREPARING ANOTHER ATTACK.\nTHEY DON'T SEEM TO BE MASTER BOMBMAKERS.\nBUT STILL THESE ARE DANGEROUS DEVICES.\nAND IT'S CRITICAL THAT PEOPLE CONTACT THE AUTHORITIES IF THEY\nKNOW, YOU KNOW, SEE ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS OR KNOW THIS PERSON.\n>> YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO STICK AROUND AND WE'LL CONTINUE THE\nCONVERSATION A LITTLE LATER.", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1474295186311.1474291943723.8641f8bf-b4a8-4d04-978a-f6381bb0a760.segment1.thumb.jpg", "channel": "202"}], "channel": "202"}, {"videos": [{"start": 768172, "length": 328828.0, "end": 1097000, "date": 1474219197080, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1474222367034.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1474218950450-644922d2-cda2-4377-98ca-400ba78371f5-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=768.17,1097.00", "text": "INJURED.\n>>> THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THE NEW JERSEY AND NEW YORK EXPLOSIONS\nARE CONNECTED, BUT AUTHORITIES ARE SIFTING NOW THROUGH ALL THE\nFORENSIC EVIDENCE FROM BOTH SCENES.\nJOININGS NOW FOR SOME INSIGHT INTO THE INVESTIGATION, A FORMER\nNEW YORK POLICE OFFICER AND FORMER SECRET SERVICE AGENT.\nDAN, GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US TODAY.\n>> GOOD TO BE HERE. >> ALL RIGHT, SO WHERE DO WE GO\nFROM HERE? AT FIRST BLUSH THESE ARE\nDIFFERENT DEVICES. BUT A BIT OF A COINCIDENCE IT'S\nTHE SAME DAY AND SAME GENERAL VICINITY, GEOGRAPHICALLY, THAT\nSECTION OF THE COUNTRY. WHAT KIND OF LINKS WOULD YOU BE\nLOOKING FOR OR SOMETHING THAT WOULD RULE OUT A LINK?\n>> WELL, YOU MAKE SOME GOOD POINTS THERE, SHANNON, AND A\nCOUPLE OF THINGS ON THIS. FIRST, AS A FORMER FEDERAL\nINVESTIGATOR THAT'S BEEN INVOLVED IN THESE JOINT TERROR\nCASES, YOU WOULD ALMOST PREFER THE SEASIDE INCIDENT AND\nMAINTAIN INCIDENT WERE LINKED, BECAUSE IT WOULD BE ONE\nCOLLECTIVE BODY OR CELL OF TERRORISTS.\nIT'S EVEN MORE DISTURBING, THINK ABOUT THIS, YOUR VIEWERS HERE,\nIF YOU HAD TWO INDEPENDENT OPERATORS OPERATING IN NEW\nJERSEY AND NEW YORK, HAVING NOTHING TO DO WITH ONE ANOTHER,\nWHO MAY, WE DON'T KNOW YET THE MOTIVATION, BUT MAY HAVE BEEN\nMOTIVATED BY SOME TYPE OF TERRORIST PROPAGANDA, THAT'S A\nFRIGHTENING PROPOSAL, BUT WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING FOR?\nONE OF THE POSITIVES TO TAKE FROM THIS IS THEY GOT THE SECOND\nDEVICE BEFORE IT EXPLODED IN MANHATTAN AND EVERY DEVICE HAS A\nSIGNATURE, THE WAY IT'S CONSTRUCTED.\nTHERE MAY BE CLUES IN THAT, THAT COULD LINK THE TWO OR NOT.\n>> THERE HAS BEEN ONE REPORT, I'VE HEARD, MULTIPLE REPORTS,\nTHERE MAY HAVE BEEN A CELL PHONE CONNECTED TO THAT SECOND DEVICE\nTHAT DID NOT DETONATE. HOW VALUABLE COULD THAT BE?\n>> OH, THAT'S EXTREMELY VALUABLE, BECAUSE ALL THESE CELL\nPHONES HAVE ESNs, ELECTRONIC SERIAL NUMBERS, MOBILE\nIDENTIFICATION NUMBERS. IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO\nCOMPLETELY WIPE FREE AN EVIDENCE PATHWAY FROM WHERE THAT CELL\nPHONE WAS ACQUIRED. EVEN IF IT'S SOMETHING LIKE A\nCRICKET PHONE, LIKE A ONE-TIME USE, IT'S STILL POSSIBLE TO\nTRACK WHERE IT WAS SENT AND WHERE IT WAS SOLD AND THESE\nSTORES NOW HAVE SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS AND THINGS LIKE THAT, SO\nIT MAY CREATE SOME COMPLICATIONS IF IT'S A ONE-TIME THROW-AWAY\nPHONE, BUT IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO TRACK AT ALL.\nNOT LIKE A DOLLAR BILL WHICH PASSES THROUGH THOUSANDS OF\nHANDS BEFORE IT WINDS UP AT ITS END POINT.\n>> ALL OF US WHO SPEND TIME IN NEW YORK KNOW THERE ARE CAMERAS\nEVERYWHERE. THEY ARE ON BUILDINGS, THEY ARE\nON BUSINESSES, THEY ARE INSIDE BUSINESSES, OUTSIDE BUSINESSES.\nHOW HELPFUL DO YOU THINK THAT WILL BE IN HELPING TO BACKTRACK\nFROM THE EXPLOSION AND THE SECOND SITE WHERE THE DEVICE,\nTHE I.E.D., THE BOMB, DIDN'T GO OFF, WAS POSSIBLY PLANTED THE\nHOURS AHEAD OF THESE DISCOVERIES?\n>> RIGHT. YEAH, THAT'S A GREAT POINT YOU\nMAKE THERE. NOW, ONE OF THE DOWNSIDES TO THE\nCAMERAS BEING IN MANHATTAN IS, OBVIOUSLY, THE POPULATION\nDENSITY OF MANHATTAN IS OFF THE CHARTS.\nSO IF THIS WAS, SAY, A RURAL TOWN, YOU KNOW, SOMEWHERE UP IN\nNEW HAMPSHIRE OR WHEREVER IT MAY BE AND YOU HAD A NETWORK OF\nCAMERAS AROUND, YOU COULD PROBABLY TRACK EVERY SINGLE CAR\nTHAT DROVE ON TO AN AREA IN THAT SMALL TOWN EASILY.\nIT'S NOT THAT EASY IN MANHATTAN, BUT, SHANNON, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY\nRIGHT, THE NETWORK OF PRIVATE CAMERAS, OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE CELL\nPHONES WHO WERE TAKING SELFIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND NYPD\nCAMERAS, YOU CAN PROBABLY PUT TOGETHER IF YOU HAD A LOT OF\nPEOPLE WORKING ON IT A REALLY SOLID PICTURE OF JUST ABOUT\nEVERY PERSON AND EVERY CAR THAT TRAVERSED THE AREA AROUND THAT\nBOMB ATTACK. IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT\nOF WORK, BUT IT CAN DEFINITELY BE DONE.\nTHAT NETWORK OF CAMERAS IS PRETTY EXTENSIVE.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT KEEPS COMING UP AND JEH\nJOHNSON JUST RECENTLY TALKING ABOUT IT AGAIN, THIS ISSUE OF\nLONE WOLVES. RIGHT NOW AUTHORITIES ARE SAYING\nNO CONNECTION WITH ISIS, WE DON'T SEE ANYTHING, BUT DOES IT\nMATTER IF THERE'S A FORMAL CONNECTION?\nBECAUSE WE SEE THESE MAGAZINES THAT GO OUT FROM TERRORIST\nORGANIZATIONS THAT BASICALLY SHOW YOU HOW TO BUILD THESE\nBOMBS, USE HOUSEHOLD GOODS AND PUT THINGS TOGETHER TO HARM\nOTHERS. DOES IT MATTER IF THERE'S A\nFORMAL LINK AND HOW MUCH TOUGHER DOES IT MAKE IT FOR PEOPLE WHO\nDO THE JOB YOU DO, TO DO THAT JOB?\n>> I'M GLAD YOU'VE ASKED THAT, BECAUSE I'VE BEEN ON YOUR\nNETWORK FOR A LONG TIME TALKING ABOUT THE LONE WOLF ATTACK IS\nWHAT HORRIFIES AND TERRORIZES ME.\nYOU ALMOST WANT A FORMAL CONNECTION TO ISIS OR AL QAEDA,\nSHANNON, BECAUSE THAT FORMAL CONNECTION CREATES INVESTIGATIVE\nFINGERPRINTS AND BREAD CRUMBS FOR THOSE TO TRACK.\nWHEN YOU HAVE THESE LONE WOLF OPERATORS OUT THERE, WHO ARE\nSITTING IN FRONT OF THE COMPUTER AND BECOMING INSPIRED BY THIS\nSICK PROPAGANDA ON THE INTERNET, ON SOCIAL MEDIA PUT OUT THERE BY\nAL QAEDA AND ISIS, THOSE INVESTIGATIVE FOOTPRINTS LARGELY\nDISAPPEAR. THAT MAN OR WOMAN IS SITTING IN\nTHEIR APARTMENT AND THE CHANCES OF YOUR FINDING THEM ARE SLIM TO\nNONE. WHEN THEY ARE TRAVELING\nOVERSEAS, THEY ARE GETTING TRAINING, GETTING BACK ON A\nPLANE, THEY ARE AVAILABLE IN TEXT, ONE OF OUR SYSTEMS TO\nCHECK PEOPLE THAT TRAVEL OVERSEAS, WE CAN INTERCEPT THEM\nAND HOPEFULLY STOP THE TERRORIST ATTACK.\nTHE LONE WOLF ATTACKS ARE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO STOP AND\nTHEY DON'T COST ANYTHING AND REQUIRE ALMOST NO TRAINING TO\nIMPLEMENT, SADLY. >> THAT'S WHY WE ARE GRATEFUL\nFOR FOLKS WHO HAVE SERVED LIKE YOU AND THOSE IN THE\nINTELLIGENCE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY WHO ARE WORKING DAY\nAND NIGHT TO PROTECT US FROM THESE THINGS.\nDAN BOGNINO, THANK YOU.", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1474222578350.1474218950450.644922d2-cda2-4377-98ca-400ba78371f5.segment4.thumb.jpg", "channel": "360"}, {"start": 63168, "length": 1728626.0, "end": 1791794, "date": 1474284974878, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1474290159113.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1474284820906-75859204-0b32-42ec-94a1-3d045dd91c3c-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=63.17,1791.79", "text": "THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\n>>> LET'S HEAD TO DONALD TRUMP. HE'S JOINING US THIS MORNING.\nGOOD MORNING. >> GOOD MORNING.\n>> I KNOW ON SATURDAY NIGHT, I SAW YOU ON TV, YOU SAID A BOMB\nWENT OFF IN NEW YORK, WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENED.\nWE'VE GATHERED A FEW MORE FACTS. OBSERVATION OF WHAT'S GOING ON\nIN THE BIG APPLE. >> WELL, IT'S A MESS, AND IT'S A\nSHAME AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE VERY TOUGH.\nI THINK MAYBE WE'LL SEE A BIG CHANGE OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF\nDAYS. I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT\nMAYBE WILL GET -- WILL HAPPEN PERHAPS MORE AND MORE ALL OVER\nTHE COUNTRY. >> WHAT DO YOU MEAN, MORE TERROR\nSTRIKES? >> YEAH.\nBECAUSE WE'VE BEEN WEAK. OUR COUNTRY HAS BEEN WEAK.\nWE'VE BEEN LETTING PEOPLE IN TENS OF THOUSANDS.\nI'VE BEEN SAYING YOU GOT TO STOP IT.\nJUST LAST WEEK, OBAMA SAID YOU GOT TO LET MORE PEOPLE IN.\n100,000. HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO\nINCREASE WHAT HE'S LED IN. HE'S LET IN THOUSANDS AND\nTHOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. THEY CAN'T BE PROPERLY VETTED.\nI SPOKE TO THE BEST PEOPLE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT.\nTHEY SAY THERE IS NO WAY OF VETTING THESE PEOPLE, SO HE LET\nIN OVER 100,000 ADDITIONAL PEOPLE, AND NOW HILLARY CLINTON\nIS RAISING IT BY 550% AND THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG\nTIME. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE POURING\nINTO OUR COUNTRY. WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WE'RE\nDOING. OUR LEADERS ARE -- I DON'T EVEN\nSAY WEAK. I SAY STUPID.\n>> HILLARY AND TIM KAINE SAID THAT ISIS STRIKES ON OUR CITIES\nMEANS WE'RE WINNING ABROAD. >> YES, I GUESS THAT'S THE WAY\nTHEY FIGURE THINGS. THEY FIGURE THINGS.\nIF WE WOULD HAVE TAKEN THEM OUT, WE WOULDN'T HAVE IT.\nTHEY ARE VERY STRONG. THEY ARE IN 28 COUNTRIES RIGHT\nNOW. THESE WERE STARTED BY HILLARY\nCLINTON AND HER POLICIES AND OBAMA, WHEN THEY GOT OUT OF\nIRAQ, THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED. THIS IS THE REMNANT OF IT AND\nIT'S MUCH MORE THAN A REMNANT. LOOK, THEY STARTED IN A SMALL\nAREA. NOW THEY ARE IN 28 COUNTRIES AND\nI LISTENED TO OBAMA SAY, WELL, WE'RE WINNING THE WAR.\nWE'RE NOT WINNING THE WAR. THEY ARE WINNING THE WAR.\n>> YOU SAID OVER THE WEEKEND TOO IT WAS TIME TO GET TOUGH AS YOU\nGOT OFF THE PLANE. JUST BEFORE YOU KNOW, THE BOMBS\nWERE FULL OF BALL BEARINGS AND SHRAPNEL.\n>> BBs. >> THAT WAS GOING TO BE MAXIMUM\nCARNAGE. WE HAVE 29 PEOPLE, JUST BECAUSE\nTHEY GOT OUT OF THE HOSPITAL DOESN'T MEAN THEY ARE OKAY.\nWHAT DO YOU MEAN WE HAVE TO GET TOUGH?\nSPECIFICALLY, DONALD TRUMP, WHAT IS THE POLICY IN DONALD TRUMP'S\nADMINISTRATION TO GETTING TOUGH? >> FIRST OF ALL, WE HAVE TO --\nTHESE ARE SICK PEOPLE. OKAY.\nTHESE ARE SICK, EVIL PEOPLE THAT WANT TO DESTROY THIS COUNTRY,\nAND THE WAY WE CODDLE THEM AND THE WAY WE'RE AFRAID TO SAY\nANYTHING AND WE'RE AFRAID TO SAY WHAT THE PROBLEM IS AND WHO THEY\nARE AND THEY DON'T WANT TO SAY RADICAL ISLAM.\nTHEY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT RADICAL ISLAM.\nOBAMA WON'T EVEN SAY THE WORDS. NEITHER WILL HILLARY CLINTON.\n>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY GETTING TOUGH, THOUGH?\n>> YOU HAVE TO HIT THEM MUCH HARDER OVER THERE AND WE'RE\nGOING TO FIND OUT -- YOU KNOW, OUR POLICE ARE AMAZING.\nOUR LOCAL POLICE, THEY KNOW WHO A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE ARE, THEY\nARE AFRAID TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT, BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO\nBE ACCUSED OF PROFILING, AND THEY DON'T WANT TO BE ACCUSED OF\nALL SORTS OF THINGS. IN ISRAEL, THEY PROFILE.\nTHEY HAVE DONE AN UNBELIEVABLE JOB, AS GOOD AS YOU CAN DO, BUT\nISRAEL HAS DONE AN UNBELIEVABLE JOB AND THEY WILL PROFILE.\nTHEY PROFILE. THEY SEE SOMEBODY THAT'S\nSUSPICIOUS. THEY WILL PROFILE.\nTHEY WILL TAKE THAT PERSON IN AND CHECK OUT.\nDO WE HAVE A CHOICE? LOOK WHAT'S GOING ON.\nDO WE REALLY HAVE A CHOICE? WE'RE TRYING TO BE SO\nPOLITICALLY CORRECT IN OUR COUNTRY AND THIS IS ONLY GOING\nTO GET WORSE. THIS ISN'T GOING TO GET BETTER.\nI'VE BEEN TALKING TO YOU GUYS FOR YEARS, AND I'VE BEEN SAYING.\n>> YOU HAVE. >> THIS IS ONLY GOING TO GET\nWORSE. YOU HAVE TO STOP THEM FROM\nCOMING INTO THE COUNTRY. >> OF COURSE, THAT'S ONE OF THE\nPRIMARY TENETS OF YOUR ENTIRE CAMPAIGN ABOUT IMMIGRATION IN\nTHE COUNTRY. >> AND IT HAS BEEN.\nTHIS ISN'T JUST SOMETHING I DEVELOPED OVERNIGHT BECAUSE OF\nTHIS. I KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.\n>> YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT FOR A VERY LONG TIME.\nYOU WERE BUSY. YOU WERE TWEETING OVER THE WEEK.\nLAST NIGHT YOU SENT THIS OUT. UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF OBAMA\nAND CLINTON, YOUR TWEET READS, AMERICANS HAVE EXPERIENCED MORE\nATTACKS AT HOME THAN VICTORIES ABROAD.\nTIME TO CHANGE THE PLAYBOOK. OKAY.\nCHANGE THE PLAYBOOK, HOW? >> WE'RE QOG TO HAVE TO DO\nSOMETHING EXTREMELY TOUGH OVER THERE.\n>> LIKE WHAT? >> LIKE NOT THE KNOCK THE HELL\nOUT OF THEM. WE HAVE TO GET EVERYBODY\nTOGETHER AND LEAD FOR A CHANGE. WE'RE NOT KNOCKING THEM.\nWE'RE HITTING THEM EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.\nWE'RE HITTING THEM IN CERTAIN PLACES.\nWE'RE BEING VERY GENTLE ABOUT IT.\nWE HAVE TO BE VERY TOUGH AND YOU HAVE OTHER COUNTRIES WHO ARE\nGETTING DEVASTATED FAR MORE THAN WE ARE.\nIT'S CALLED LEADERSHIP. THEY HAVE TO FIGHT.\nTHEY HAVE TO FIGHT THE BATTLE. THE BATTLE IS OVER THERE.\nWE HAVE TO FIGHT THE BATTLE AND WE CAN'T LET ANY MORE PEOPLE\nCOME INTO THIS COUNTRY AND WHEN WE HAVE BAD ONES -- WE HAVE\nPEOPLE GOING OVER FIGHTING FOR ISIS AND COMING BACK AND WE KNOW\nTHEY ARE FIGHTING FOR ISIS AND WE TAKE THEM.\nONCE YOU LEAVE THIS COUNTRY, YOU FIGHT FOR ISIS, YOU NEVER COME\nBACK. >> THE PROBLEM IS HILLARY\nCLINTON HAS ALREADY RULED OUT EVER PUTTING TROOPS ON THE\nGROUND, YET WE DON'T GET ANY INTELLIGENCE, WE DON'T ARREST\nANYBODY. WE SHOOT PEOPLE FROM DRONES AND\nPLANES. WOULD DONALD TRUMP PUT PEOPLE ON\nTHE GROUND IF NECESSARY? >> THE FACT THAT SHE EVEN SAID\nTHAT IS A TERRIBLE THING BECAUSE WHEN YOU SAY THAT, YOU ARE\nGIVING THE ENEMY -- YOU ARE GIVING THE ENEMY HEART.\nYOU ARE SAYING TO THE ENEMY WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT.\nEVEN IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO PUT TROOPS ON THE GROUND, YOU SHOULD\nNEVER SAY IT. SHE'S SAYING THAT BECAUSE SHE'S\nDESPERATE FOR VOTES. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT\nHER POLL NUMBERS, LOOK, IF YOU WANT WEAKNESS, SHE'S WEAK.\nI WATCHED HER IN THE AIRPLANE OVER THE WEEKEND TALKING, AND I\nCOULDN'T -- I WOULD HATE TO SEE FOR MOUR -- FORGETTING ABOUT ME.\nI WOULD HEY TO SEE FOUR MORE YEARS OF THOSE KIND OF ANSWERS.\n>> YOU MENTIONED OUR LEADERS ARE NOT CALLING WHAT IT IS.\nFUNNY YOU SAY THAT, JUST AFTER ALL THESE ATTACKS OVER THIS\nAREA, THE MAYOR OF THIS CITY, BILL DE BLASIO HE'S NOT CALLING\nIT TERRORISM. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING ISN'T\nIT TERRORISM IF PEOPLE BOMBING AREAS OF NEW YORK CITY.\nISN'T THAT THE DEFINITION ITSELF OF TERRORISM?\nHE WON'T CALL IT THAT. >> IT'S INCREDIBLE.\nHILLARY WON'T SAY IT. PRESIDENT OBAMA GAVE A PRESS\nCONFERENCE TALKED ABOUT WHY HE WOULDN'T CALL IT TERRORISM.\nHE SHOULD TALK MORE ABOUT HOW TO GETTING THESE PEOPLE.\nYOU NEVER SAW THE PROBLEM IF YOU ARE AFRAID TO USE THE REAL NAME.\nTHIS IS RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM.\nTHE GUY IN MINNESOTA IS GOING AROUND, SCREAMING HIS WORDS,\nSLASHING PEOPLE, KNIFING PEOPLE, VICIOUSLY SLASHING PEOPLE.\nIT'S CRAZY HOW THEY CAME INTO THE COUNTRY IN THE FIRST PLACE\nIS BEYOND BELIEF. THIS IS GOING TO BE LIKE THE\nTROJAN HORSE. WE'RE LETTING TENS OF THOUSANDS\nOF PEOPLE FLOW INTO THIS COUNTRY AND THEY ARE BRINGING IN IN MANY\nCASES THIS IS CANCER FROM WITHIN.\nTHIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE SO TOUGH AND YOU KNOW THEY\nSTAY TOGETHER, SO NOBODY REALLY KNOWS WHO IT IS, WHAT'S\nHAPPENING. THEY ARE PLOTTING.\nTHEY KEEP PLOTTING, AND THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR SO LONG AND\nEVERYBODY KNOWS IT AND THE GOOD LAW ENFORCEMENT, WE HAVE SUCH\nGREAT PEOPLE. THAT'S THE BEST THING WE HAVE\nGOING. GREAT LAW ENFORCEMENT.\nTHEY KNOW ABOUT IT. >> DONALD TRUMP, SPEAKING OF\nGREAT LAW ENFORCEMENT, WE'RE LOOKING AT MEMBERS OF THE ATF\nAND FBI. THERE'S A LIVE RAID RIGHT NOW\nOUT IN ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY. IS IT RELATED TO THE FIVE GUYS\nWHO WERE ARRESTED COMING OFF THE BRIDGE LAST NIGHT.\n>> WHO WERE FROM ELIZABETH. >> FROM ELIZABETH GOING TO THE\nAIRPORT, WE DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT.\nFROM FOLKS AT HOME, SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH OUR TICKER DOWN\nBELOW. THAT'S OLD NEWS.\nWE APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. WHEN WE FIRST STARTED THE\nINTERVIEW, MR. TRUMP, WE HAD NOT HEARD FROM YOU SINCE SATURDAY\nNIGHT WHEN YOU CAME OFF THE PLANE, SAYING A BOMB WENT OFF IN\nNEW YORK. NOBODY KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON.\nTHEN YOU WERE HIT BY MAINSTREAM MEDIA BY USING THE WORD BOMB\nBEFORE THE AUTHORITIES CONFIRMED THE ATTACK.\nYET, HILLARY CLINTON REFERRED TO THE BOMBINGS IN NEW YORK AND NEW\nJERSEY BUT CNN EDITED THAT OUT. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?\n>> CNN IS DISGUSTING AND THEY ARE DISGRACEFUL.\nI LOVE WATCH IT. AND SOMETIMES FOX DOESN'T TREAT\nME OKAY, BUT THAT'S OKAY. >> WE'RE FAIR-AND-BALANCED.\n>> THAT'S OKAY. I WATCH CNN.\nHOW ABOUT BILL CLINTON'S STATEMENT LAST WEEK WHERE HE\nTALKED ABOUT HER SICKNESS AND SAID SOMETHING, IT HAPPENS ALL\nTHE TIME OR SOMETHING -- >> FREQUENTLY.\n>> HE SAID FREQUENTLY. AND HE SAID OH, I MEANT IT ONLY\nHAPPENED -- IN OTHER WORDS, SHE ONLY GETS -- SHE GETS SICK ALL\nTHE TIME OR FREQUENTLY, AND THEN HE GOES, OH, I MEAN, JUST EVERY\nONCE IN A WHILE. >> AND THEN THEY EDITED IT OUT.\n>> THEY TOOK IT OUT. DO YOU THINK IF THAT HAPPENED TO\nME, DO YOU THINK THEY WOULD TAKE IT OUT?\nTHEY NOT ONLY TAKE IT OUT. IT FEELS LIKE THEY ADD THINGS.\nTHESE PEOPLE ARE THE MOST DISHONEST PEOPLE.\nCNN IS SO DISGUSTING AND DISHONEST.\nTHEY CALL IT THE CLINTON NEWS NETWORK.\nIF YOU SAW HER IN THE BACK OF THE PLANE AND SHE USED THE WORDS\nBOMBS ALSO, BY THE WAY, I HEARD, I DIDN'T SEE IT.\nI HEARD I WAS CRITICIZED FOR CALLING IT CORRECTLY.\nWHAT I SAID WAS EXACTLY CORRECT. I SHOULD BE A NEWS CASTER\nBECAUSE I CALLED IT BEFORE THE NEWS WHAT I SAID WAS EXACTLY\nCORRECT AND EVERYBODY SAYS WHILE HE WAS RIGHT, HE CALLED IT TOO\nSOON. OKAY.\nGIVE ME A BREAK. BUT HILLARY CLINTON USED THE\nWORD \"BOMB\" SHORTLY THEREAFTER AND NOBODY SAID ANYTHING ABOUT\nIT AND SOMEBODY SAID SOMEBODY OF THEM EDIT THAT WORD\nTHEY TOOK IT OUT RVETH THEY DID. >> FOLKS, IT'S A RIGGED SYSTEM,\nAND I'VE BEEN SAYING IT FOR A LONG TIME, AND THE NEWS IS AS\nDISHONEST AS ANYBODY THERE IS. >> WHY DO THEY CARE SO MUCH IF\nTHEY USE THE WORD \"BOMBING\" OR NOT.\nWE'RE TALKING ABOUT A TERRORIST ATTACK.\nWHY IS THAT? >> BECAUSE THE AUTHORITIES HAD\nNOT OFFICIALLY RELEASED THAT IT WAS A BOMBING.\n>> THAT'S NOT REALLY THE REASON. THE REASON IS BECAUSE MY POLL\nNUMBERS ARE SO GOOD THAT THEY ARE SO WORRIED.\nTHEY WILL DO ANYTHING THEY CAN TO STOP COMMON SENSE.\nIT'S COMMON SENSE, BUT THEY WILL DO ANYTHING.\nTHINK OF IT, HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO ALLOW HUNDREDS OF\nTHOUSANDS OF THESE SAME PEOPLE THAT ARE, THEY HAVE SUCH HATRED\nAND SICKNESS IN THEIR HEART. IT'S SICKNESS, BUT -- IT'S\nSICKNESS AND IT'S HATRED AND SHE WANTS TO ALLOW -- SHE WANTS MORE\nTO COME IN. THES TRYING -- SHE'S TRYING TO\nPROVE SHE'S MORE LIBERAL THAN BERNIE SANDERS.\nSHE WANTS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TO POUR INTO THIS\nCOUNTRY AND WE HAVE NO IDEA WHO THEY ARE.\n>> WE'RE WATCHING THIS VIDEO BECAUSE ABOVE THE FIRST AMERICAN\nFRIED CHICKEN STORE, EVIDENTLY, THERE'S APARTMENTS AND THERE'S A\nRAID GOING ON RIGHT NOW THAT MIGHT BE RELATED --\n>> NEAR TO AN ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY, BOMB, THAT WAS FOUND AND\nBLOWN UP BY A BOMB ROBOT THAT LOST ITS ARM IN THAT BOMB, SO\nTHEY NEED A NEW ROBOT, BUT GOOD NEWS, NO ONE IS HURT.\nI GOT TO ASK YOU, DONALD TRUMP, AMONG THE PEOPLE WHO GOT\nBLOWBACK FOR AN INTERVIEW WAS JIMMY FALLON.\nEVIDENTLY, HE WAS HEAVILY CRITICIZED BECAUSE HE HUMANIZED\nYOU. WHAT'S YOUR REACTION TO THAT?\n>> WELL, I HEARD THAT AND HE ALSO GOT TREMENDOUS RATINGS THAT\nNIGHT, SO HE'S SMARTER THAN ALL OF THEM PUT TOGETHER.\nI HEARD THAT AND DR. OZ HAS HAD THE HIGHEST RATING SHOWS IN\nYEARS. I'M HAPPY FOR THEM.\nYOU KNOW WHAT, I WAS HAPPY TO DO HIS SHOW.\nHE ASKED ME TO DO HIS SHOW. I ASKED THE EMMY'S AND THERE WAS\nSO MANY SKITS ABOUT TRUMP. WE HAD A GREAT TIME.\nIT WAS FANTASTIC. HE GOT REALLY HIGH RATINGS FOR\nJIMMY FALLON. >> ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT THAT?\nIF SOMEONE DOES AN INTERVIEW THAT COMES OUT GOOD, THAT THEIR\nCAREER COULD BE HURT? >> I'M GOING TO BE TREATED VERY\nUNFAIRLY DURING THE DEBATE. MATT LAUER WAS VERY FAIR AND HE\nDID A VERY GOOD JOB AND EVERYBODY SAID I WON THAT\nDEBATE, IF YOU CALL IT A DEBATE, THE ONE ON NBC LAST WEEK, THE\nTOWN HALL. THEY SAID THAT THAT WAS A -- THE\nFORUM. THEY SAID THAT THAT WAS A -- AN\nEVENT THAT I WON, AND MATT LAUER WAS BADLY CRITICIZED, AND I\nTHINK, YOU KNOW, I'LL BE HONEST, I THINK THAT SYSTEM IS\nDISGRACEFUL. >> DO YOU KNOW WHO THIS\nMODERATOR IS GOING TO BE? >> IT'S GOING TO BE LESTER HOLT.\n>> ARE YOU GOING TO BE LESTER HOLT IS GOING TO BE UNFAIR TO\nYOU NOW? >> WELL, YOU KNOW, I HAVE A SET\nOF THINGS THAT I'LL BE DOING IF THAT'S THE CASE.\nI THINK HE -- I ALWAYS FOUND HIM TO BE FAIR, BUT, YOU KNOW, THE\nSYSTEM, AS I SAID, IT'S A VERY, VERY DIRTY SYSTEM, AND IT'S A\nVERY UNFAIR SYSTEM, SO WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS, BUT, YOU KNOW, I\nFEEL VERY CONFIDENT GOING INTO THE DEBATE.\nI HAVE MUCH BETTER SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS.\nWE HAVE PLENTY OF PROBLEMS. YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON.\nBUT NOW, A NEW PROBLEM COMES UP AND THAT'S THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE\nPOURING INTO OUR COUNTRY AND WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.\nWE HAVE TO STOP IT. >> OKAY.\n>> WE HAVE TO STOP IT AND WE HAVE TO STOP IT NOW.\n>> AND IN ALL RELATES TO TERROR, YOU SAY.\nABC NEWS, MR. TRUMP, IS REPORTING THAT THE FBI IS GOING\nTO BE PUTTING OUT A WANTED POSTER LATER TODAY FOR A\n28-YEAR-OLD SUSPECT IN THE NEW YORK CITY BOMBING.\nABC NEWS HAS JUST LEARNED. ALSO, ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE\nLEARNED -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S GOING ON HERE IN NEW YORK\nCITY STARTING TODAY IS THE U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY AND WE HAVE\nHEARD, MR. TRUMP, THAT AFTER HILLARY CLINTON SAID LAST WEEK\nTHAT SHE WAS GOING TO BE MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT OF EGYPT,\nPRESIDENT AL SISI, THAT YOU WILL BE MEETING WITH HIM AS WELL.\n>> I DON'T WANT TO COMMENT WHO I'M MEETING WITH.\nI WILL SAY THAT WITH ALL THE FOLKS BEING IN NEW YORK, I'VE\nHAD A LOT OF CALLS FROM A LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE ON THE BASIS\nTHAT I'M DOING WELL AND, YOU KNOW, THEY SEEM TO THINK IT'S\nIMPORTANT TO MAYBE MEET BUT BUT I DON'T WANT TO COMMENT\nSPECIFICALLY ON WHO BUT A COUPLE OF PEOPLE ARE COMING OVER.\nI'VE ALREADY MET WITH A COUPLE. >> YOU'VE ALREADY MET WITH OTHER\nWORLD LEADERS. >> I JUST DON'T WANT TO COMMENT\nSPECIFICALLY ON WHO THEY ARE. >> WERE YOU EVENTUALLY?\n>> YEAH, I THINK SO. YEAH, I THINK SO.\nBUT WE WILL SEE. LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY, IT WILL\nBE A VERY INTERESTING DAY OR TWO.\n>> CAN I ASK YOU THIS? WHEN YOU SAT DOWN WITH THESE\nWORLD LEADERS, DID YOU HAVE TO DISABUSE THEM OF HOW YOU'VE BEEN\nLABELED? DID THEY HAVE QUESTIONS FOR YOU\nBECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN INTERNATIONAL CONCERNS, WE HAD A\nSENATOR FROM DELAWARE SAYING THE WORLD IS UNEASY ABOUT YOUR\nCANDIDACY? >> WELL, MAYBE THAT'S A GOOD\nTHING, NOT A BAD THING. RIGHT NOW, THE WORLD HAS NO\nRESPECT FOR OUR COUNTRY. THEY HAVE NO RESPECT FOR OUR\nPRESIDENT WHATSOEVER. YOU SEE THIS KIND OF STUFF\nHAPPENING. THE WORLD TAKES ADVANTAGE OF US\nON TRADE. THEY ARE STEALING OUR JOBS.\nTHEY ARE MOVING TO MEXICO. CHINA IS TREATING US LIKE WE'RE\nA CHILD, THE WAY THEY DO. YOU KNOW, THEY CHARGE TAX BUT WE\nDON'T CHARGE TAX. YOU WANT TO DO BUSINESS IN\nTAX -- IN CHINA, YOU HAVE TO PAY A LOT.\nYOU WANT TO DO BUSINESS HERE, THE CHINESE, NO PROBLEM, COME ON\nIN. DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO.\nIT'S A TOTALLY UNFAIR AND VERY FOOLISH SYSTEM.\n>> YOU ONLY HAVE ABOUT A MONTH AND A HALF LEFT IN THIS RACE.\nIT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT. WHAT'S YOUR PLAN GOING FORWARD?\nWHAT CAN WE EXPECT IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS?\n>> WELL, WE'RE HAVING BIG RALLIES TODAY I'M IN FLORIDA AND\nWE'RE HAVING RALLIES WHERE WE'RE GETTING 25, 30,000 PEOPLE THIS\nWEEK. I THINK WE HAVE ONE WE'RE TRYING\nTO GET A LARGE STADIUM AS OPPOSED TO WHERE WE ARE.\nWE HAVE AN 8,000 SEAT VENUE IN FT. MYERS AND WE'RE TRYING TO\nGET AN OPEN PARK OR A VENUE OF SOME KIND THAT WILL HOLD 35,\n40,000 PEOPLE BECAUSE WE'RE BEING INUNDATED.\nTHE WORD IS OUT. I MEAN, THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING\nWITH ME FROM ALMOST FROM THE TIME I WENT FROM JUNE 16th --\nIT'S HARD TO BELIEVE. WE'RE RIGHT.\nWE'RE TALKING ABOUT A SUCH SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.\nJUNE 16th IS WHEN I ANNOUNCED LAST YEAR AND HERE WE HAVE WITH\nNOT MUCH TIME LEFT. >> REINCE PRIEBUS SAID YESTERDAY\nTHE FORMER CANDIDATES WHO REFUSED TO GET ON BOARD THE\nTRUMP TRAIN COULD BE LOOKING AT SOME SORT OF PENALTIES FOR\nWITHHOLDING THEIR SUPPORT, IN PARTICULAR JOHN KASICH AND TED\nCRUZ AND THINGS LIKE THAT. MR. KASICH SAID WE'RE NOT GOING\nTO BE BULLIED BY REINCE PRIEBUS. DO YOU KNOW THESE GUYS ARE GOING\nTO JUMP ON BOARD BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE?\n>> I REALLY DON'T CARE. THAT'S UP TO THEM.\nTHEY SIGNED A VERY STRONG PLEDGE.\nTHEY SIGNED IT BECAUSE THEY WANTED ME TO SIGN IT.\nYOU REMEMBER THAT VERY WELL. EVERYBODY WANTED ME TO SIGN IT\nBECAUSE THEY THOUGHT I MIGHT RUN ON A DIFFERENT PARTY OR\nWHATEVER, WHICH I DON'T THINK -- IT'S NOT HAPPENED.\nBUT THEY ALL WANTED ME TO SIGN AND THEY ALL WANTED ME TO SIGN\nTHE LEDGE. IT'S NO OUTS.\nI WILL AGREE TO RUN. YOU CAN GET THE BEST LAWYER.\nYOU COULDN'T DRAW IT ANY STRONGER.\nON TOP OF THAT, THEY SIGN ANOTHER AGREEMENT WHERE THEY\nHAVE THE RIGHT TO USE ALL OF THE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS\nWORTH OF DATA FROM THE RNC. SO THAT WAS LIKE CONSIDERATION.\nNOW THEN THERE WERE THREE OR FOUR OF THEM THAT DID NOT HONOR\nIT AND THE REASON THEY DIDN'T HONOR IS BECAUSE THEY GOT BEATEN\nSO BADLY. I BEAT KASICH SO BADLY THAT IT\nWAS UNBELIEVABLE. I WON, YOU KNOW, 42 STATES AND\nHE WON ONE AND BY THE WAY DIDN'T WIN IT BY MUCH.\nTHAT WAS OHIO. I'M RIGHT NOW LEADING IN OHIO BY\nA LOT. WE'RE GETTING ALONG GREAT WITH\nROB PORTMAN WHO IS DOING WELL. WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER.\nWE'VE ENDORSE DS EACH OTHER. WE HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP,\nBUT KASICH ISN'T ON BOARD. THE ONLY REASON HE'S NOT ON\nBOARD IS HE GOT BEATEN SO BADLY. HE GOT BEATEN AS BADLY AS\nANYBODY CAN GET BEATEN. HE STAYED IN THE RACE AND HE\nKEPT STAYING, SAYING, HE WOULD GO TO A RACE AND PRACTICALLY NO\nVOTES AND ON TO THE NEXT ONE. BY THE WAY, THERE WERE MANY\nPEOPLE WHO DID MUCH BETTER THAN KASICH, THE ONLY DIFFERENCE WHEN\nTHEY SAW THEY WEREN'T GOING TO WIN, THEY GOT IT.\nKASICH STAYED THERE FOREVER. I DON'T MIND.\nIF KASICH DOESN'T ENDORSE ME, THAT'S FINE.\nI WILL SAY THIS, HE AND BUSH AND ALL OF THESE PEOPLE SIGNED\nPLEDGES, TED CRUZ, THERE ARE FOUR OF THEM, I GUESS, THE REST\nOF THEM CAME ON BOARD. BEN CARSON ENDORSED ME.\nHE'S A BIG PART OF OUR CAMPAIGN, AS YOU KNOW.\nWE HAVE CHRIS CHRIS SI. WE HAVE MOST -- MOST OF THEM\nHAVE ENDORSED ME AND THAT'S GREAT.\nYOU ALSO KNOW HOW WELL IT'S GOING.\n>> DONALD, DO YOU THINK THERE SHOULD BE RETRIBUTION AND THEY\nSHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO RUN AGAIN?\n>> THEY SIGN A CONTRACT, BRIAN. THE CONTRACT IS SO CLEAR.\nIT SAID I WILL ENDORSE THE PERSON THAT, YOU KNOW, WINS THE\nPRIMARIES AND I WON -- NOT ONLY DID I WIN, I GOT 14 MILLION\nVOTES. I GOT MORE VOTES THAN ANYBODY IN\nTHE HISTORY OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\nI HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THIS.\nREINCE PRIEBUS IS DOING A VERY GOOD JOB BUT IT SHOWS HE'S A\nTOUGH COOKIE. HE DOESN'T LIKE IT WHEN YOU SIGN\nA PLEDGE AND THEN YOU USE THEIR DATA OF WHICH COST THEM MILLIONS\nAND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO -- BECAUSE OF THE FACT YOU SIGNED A\nPLEDGE AND THEN YOU VIOLATE IT, LOOK, THEY SIGNED AN AGREEMENT\nAND THE AGREEMENT SAYS WITHOUT QUESTION, IT SAYS I WILL -- NOW\nTHEY ARE VIOLATING IT AND NOBODY TALKS ABOUT.\nTHEY SAY WHAT WONDERFUL PEOPLE. NOBODY TALKS ABOUT THE FACT THAT\nTHEY VIOLATED A PLEDGE. >> MR. TRUMP, WITH THE\nPOLITICIAN, WITH ANYBODY, YOU ARE ONLY AS GOOD AS YOUR WORD.\nIS ANYBODY GOING TO TRUST THESE GUYS EVER AGAIN?\nHOW COULD THEY POSSIBLY RUN FOR PRESIDENT OR ANYTHING ELSE?\n>> YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS, THEY GOT BEATEN SO BADLY AND THEY DIDN'T\nEXPECT -- I MEAN, JEB EXPECTED TO WIN.\nKASICH, I DON'T KNOW HOW HE EXPECTED TO WIN, BUT I GUESS HE\nDID, BUT HE CERTAINLY GOT VERY FEW VOTES.\nHE WOULD GO TO THESE STATES AND HE WOULD BOMB IN EVERY STATE,\nBUT HE WAS STUBBORN. HE SAYS I'M GOING TO THE NEXT\nONE. I REMEMBER ONE OF THE REPORTERS\nASKED HIM WELL, YOU DID VERY POORLY HERE, ARE YOU GETTING OUT\nOF THE RACE? NO, SIR, I'M GOING -- HE JUST\nSTAYED IN. I DON'T KNOW WHY HE STAYED IN\nBECAUSE HE HAD NO CHANCE, BUT WHAT THEY DO IS THESE PEOPLE ALL\nWANT TO RUN IN FOUR YEARS, RIGHT?\nIF I WERE THE HEAD OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, I WOULD SAY\nYOU CAN'T DO IT, BUT WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO?\nIN THE MEANTIME, WE'RE EITHER TIED OR LEADING.\nWE'RE DOING VERY WELL AND IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE THEIR\nSUPPORT, BUT I DON'T -- AT THIS POINT, I DON'T REALLY EVEN CARE\nABOUT THEIR SUPPORT, WHATEVER HAPPENS.\n>> CAN WE GET BACK TO WHAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW ON THE SCREEN.\nIT'S THE FBI RAIDING AN APARTMENT ABOVE THE FIRST\nAMERICAN FRIED CHICKEN IN ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY.\nTHIS HAPPENING AFTER THERE WAS AN EXPLOSION IN THE MIDDLE OF\nTHE NIGHT AT THE TRAIN STATION IN NEW JERSEY, AND THEN WE ALSO\nHAD SOME EXPLOSIONS OVER THE WEEKEND AT SATISFYSIDE --\nSEASIDE PARK IN NEW JERSEY. WE UNDERSTAND THAT GOVERNOR\nCUOMO IS GOING TO BE ON WITH US A LITTLE BIT LATER.\nSOON, I SUDDEN SAY. HE'S SAYING THERE IS A FOREIGN\nCONNECTION HERE. THERE MAY BE A FOREIGN\nCONNECTION. >> I THINK THERE IS.\nI THINK THERE'S MANY FOREIGN CONNECTIONS.\nI THINK THIS IS ONE GROUP. THIS IS ONE GROUP.\nBUT YOU HAVE MANY, MANY GROUPS, BECAUSE WE'RE ALLOWING THESE\nPEOPLE TO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY AND DESTROY OUR COUNTRY AND MAKE\nIT UNSAFE FOR PEOPLE. WE'RE ALLOWING THESE PEOPLE TO\nCOME IN. WE DON'T WANT TO -- WE DON'T\nWANT TO DO ANY PROFILING. IF SOMEBODY LOOKS LIKE HE'S GOT\nA MASSIVE BOMB ON HIS BACK, WE WON'T GO UP TO THAT PERSON AND\nSAY, I'M SORRY, BECAUSE IF HE LOOKS LIKE HE COMES FROM THAT\nPART OF THE WORLD. WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO PROFILE.\nGIVE ME A BREAK. >> DONALD TRUMP, THE PROBLEM IS\nYOU DO NOT NEED TO GO TO SYRIA OR IRAQ OR ANYWHERE.\nYOU CAN GET -- BECOME A MILITANT ON THE INTERNET BY WATCHING SOME\nOF THESE SO-CALLED CHARISMATIC ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS BELIEVE IT OR\nNOT, LIKE ALAWAKI, HE'S STILL RADICALIZING THESE PEOPLE EVEN\nAFTER HIS DEATH. HOW DO YOU STOP IT?\n>> IT'S CALLED FREEDOM OF THE PRESS, WHERE THEY BUY MAGAZINES\nAND THEY TELL YOU HOW TO MAKE THESE SAME BOMBS THAT YOU SAW.\nPEOPLE WILL GO CRAZY. TRUMP IS AGAINST FREEDOM OF THE\nPRESS. I'M TOTALLY IN FAVOR OF THE\nFREEDOM OF THE PRESS. HOW DO YOU LIKE MAGAZINES THAT\nTELL YOU FROM STEP ONE, GO TO THE STORE AND BUY SUCH-AND-SUCH,\nRIGHT? SIMPLE, SIMPLE, STUFF AND IT'S\nDEVASTATING. YOU LOOK AT THAT WITH THE NAILS\nINSIDE. THEY TELL YOU ABOUT THE NAILS.\nWHAT KIND OF NAILS TO BUY. WHAT KIND OF -- WHAT\nMANUFACTURER TO BUY. THEY TELL YOU HOW TO MAKE BOMBS.\nWE SHOULD ARREST THE PEOPLE THAT DO THAT BECAUSE THEY ARE\nPARTICIPATING IN CRIME. WE SHOULD ARREST THEM.\nINSTEAD THEY SAY OH, NO, YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING.\nTHAT'S FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION. >> WHY DO THEY ALLOW THE\nWEBSITES? YOU CAN GO ONLINE?\n>> THAT'S THE SAME THING. THOSE PEOPLE SHOULD BE ARRESTED\nBECAUSE THEY ARE INCITING VIOLENCE.\nTHEY ARE MAKING VIOLENCE POSSIBLE.\nTHEY SHOULD BE ARRESTED IMMEDIATELY.\nTHEY HAVE WEBSITES THAT TELL HOW TO MAKE BOMBS, HOW TO MAKE ALL\nSORTS OF THINGS THAT ARE TOTALLY DESTRUCTIVE, AND YOU KNOW WHERE\nTHEY ARE COMING FROM, AND YET WE DON'T WANT TO TOUCH THEM BECAUSE\nOF FREEDOM OF SPEECH. >> IS THERE A CONNECTION TO THE\nEXPLOSIONS IN NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY TO THAT BUILDING THAT\nWE'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT THERE? THERE'S AN FBI RAID UNDER WAY\nFOR THE FOLKS WHO ARE TUNING IN. THE FBI IS GOING TO BE PUTTING\nOUT A WANTED POSTER VERY SHORTLY.\nIT FEATURES A 28-YEAR-OLD SUSPECT, AND SO WE'RE STANDING\nBY FOR THAT. I'VE GOT A QUESTION FOR YOU,\nTHOUGH, AND WE'VE BEEN TALKING FOR THE LAST 20 MINUTES WITH\nDONALD TRUMP. MR. TRUMP, YESTERDAY THE MAYOR\nOF NEW YORK CITY, BILL DE BLASIO WOULD NOT CALL IT TERROR.\nHE SAID IT WAS INTENTIONAL. IT WAS VIOLENT.\nIT WAS CERTAINLY A CRIMINAL ACT. IT WAS A BOMBING.\nWOULD NOT CALL IT TERROR. THE GOVERNOR CUOMO SAID IT WAS\nTERRORISM. WHAT'S UP WITH DE BLASIO?\nCLEARLY, IT'S TERROR. >> WELL, I WAS WITH THE GOVERNOR\nTHE OTHER DAY AND HE UNDERSTANDS THE PROBLEM AND HE'S CALLING IT\nRIGHT. I WILL SAY THAT UNTIL VERY\nRECENTLY, HILLARY CLINTON WOULDN'T EVEN SAY RADICAL\nISLAMIC TERROR. I HAVEN'T HEARD SAY THAT BY THE\nWAY. SHE'S VERY LOATHE TO SAY THE\nTERM. THIS IS RADICAL ISLAMIC\nTERRORISM. WE HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT REFUSES\nTO SAY IT. NOBODY UNDERSTANDS WHY.\nTHEY HAVE THOUGHT PROCESS. BUT NOBODY UNDERSTANDS WHY.\nWE HAVE A PRESIDENT REFUSE. AND THEN WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE\nFIGHTING PEOPLE AND OUR LEADER REFUSES TO SAY WHAT IT IS AND\nWHO IT IS WE'RE FIGHTING. >> GOVERNOR CUOMO GOT BLOWBACK,\nHE WAS TALKING TO YOU AND WAS NICE TO YOU AT THE 9/11\nCEREMONY. >> OH, I DIDN'T HEAR THAT.\nHE WAS VERY NICE AND WE HAD A GREAT TALK.\nI DIDN'T REALIZE HE GOT BLOWBACK.\nI'M PROBABLY NOT SURPRISED. LOOK, IT'S A BADGE OF HONOR.\nI'M DOING THIS BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT\nAGAIN. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT STRONG\nAND WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT PROSPEROUS AGAIN.\nWE'RE NOT GOING TO LET OUR TRADE.\nYOU HAVE TO SEE OUR TRADE DEALS. I'VE BEEN STUDYING TRADE DEALS\nOVER THE WEEK. CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS IS WHAT I'M\nDOING NOW? I USED TO HAVE A GOOD TIME OVER\nTHE WEEKEND. BUT I'VE LOOKED AT TRADE DEALS.\nI ACTUALLY ENJOY DOING THIS. I LOOK AT TRADE DEALS THAT ARE\nSO BAD, THIS NATFA IS A ONE-WAY STREET RIGHT OUT OF OUR COUNTRY.\nOUR JOBS GO RIGHT OUT OF OUR COUNTRY.\nOUR COMPANIES, IT'S A ONE-WAY STREET FOR OUR COMPANIES AND OUR\nJOBS TO GET OUT OF HERE. NOBODY COMES IN.\nDID YOU EVER HEAR OF NATFA COMING IN AND BRINGING JOBS?\nDID YOU EVER HEAR OF LIKE NATFA, A NEW COMPANY IS OPENING IN\nUPSTATE NEW YORK BECAUSE OF NATFA?\nIT IS A TERRIBLE SITUATION. >> THEY TALK ABOUT PRICES BEING\nLOW BECAUSE OF IT, BUT MAX IS NOT HAPPY HERE AND THAT'S --\n>> NO, THEY ARE HAPPY. MEXICO IS HAPPY. THE GRAVY TRAIN WILL END.\nWE'LL HAVE OUR JOBS -- IF I GET IN, BECAUSE OUR JOBS ARE COMING\nBACK TO OUR COUNTRY. >> ALL RIGHT.\nMR. TRUMP, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING.\n>> OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\n>> THANK YOU. >> IT'S AN EXCITING WEEK BUT\nIT'S A HAIR-RAISING WEEK BECAUSE WHAT YOU ARE SEEING IS A SERIES\nOF BOMBS AND BOMBING ATTEMPTS. >> IT IS 7:30 NOW HERE IN NEW\nYORK CITY AND AS PEOPLE GO TO WORK, THEY ARE ON PINS AND\nNEEDLES BECAUSE OF, FOR INSTANCE, WHAT HAPPENED LAST\nNIGHT. LAST NIGHT, ABOUT 9:30 OVER IN\nELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY, A COUPLE OF GUYS WERE LEAVING A\nRESTAURANT, SAW ON TOP OF A GARBAGE CAN THIS KNAPSACK.\nWONDERED WHAT THAT WAS. LOOKED INSIDE.\nIT WAS BOMBS. THEY PICKED IT UP.\nTHEY LOOKED IN IT AND THE BOMB SQUAD TRIED TO DEFUSE IT AND\nTHEY DETONATED IT BY ACCIDENT RIGHT THERE.\n>> RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE RAIDING AN APARTMENT ABOVE A RESTAURANT\nTHERE IN ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY. FIVE MEN HAVE BEEN ARRESTED WITH\nCONNECTIONS TO ELIZABETH NEW JERSEY.\nWE'RE NOT SURE WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE THAT RAID BUT WE'RE\nJOINED NOW BY THE GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK, GOVERNOR CUOMO.\nI UNDERSTAND YOU WERE ON ANOTHER NETWORK, YOU WERE CALLING, YOU\nSAID THERE WAS A FOREIGN CONNECTION, IS THAT TRUE?\n>> WELL, WHEN WE HAD SPOKEN YESTERDAY ABOUT THE INCIDENT, I\nSAID THAT I BELIEVED IT WAS CLEARLY AN ACT OF TERRORISM BY\nDEFINITION. IT WAS DANGEROUS FOR HUMAN\nBEINGS. IT APPEARED DESIGNED TO\nINTIMIDATE OR COERCE. SO IT WAS TERRORISM.\nWE DON'T KNOW IF THERE WAS A FOREIGN CONNECTION AND I SAID\nTHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE.\nMAYBE THERE'S A GROUP THAT WILL CLAIM OWNERSHIP OR WE'LL FIND\nOUT WHO WAS BEHIND IT. AS THE INVESTIGATION HAS\nPROCEEDED AND AS YOU'VE REPORTED, THE INVESTIGATION IS\nNOW FOCUSING ON ONE INDIVIDUAL, AND THAT WOULD SUGGEST BY THIS\nINDIVIDUAL THAT THERE IS A FOREIGN CONNECTION TO THESE\nACTS. >> GOVERNOR, FIRST OF ALL, IS\nTHERE A NAME CONNECTED TO THIS 28-YEAR-OLD WHOSE PICTURE I\nUNDERSTAND IS GOING TO BE RELEASED VERY SHORTLY AND ALSO\nCOULD YOU UPDATE US ON GOING ON THIS MORNING?\n>> YEAH. IN TERMS OF THE NAME, I WOULD\nLEAVE IT TO THE FBI AND THE JOINT TASK FORCE TO RELEASE THE\nNAME. I'M THE FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL\nIN NEW YORK. I WAS INVOLVED IN A LOT OF\nINVESTIGATIONS. I UNDERSTAND THE PUBLIC HAS A\nRIGHT TO BE INFORMED, BUT WE ALSO DON'T WANT TO DISRUPT THE\nINVESTIGATION ITSELF, BUT IT'S FAIR TO SAY A YOUNG MAN WHO WAS\nOF FOREIGN DESCENT AND I'M SURE THE NAME WILL BE RELEASED\nSHORTLY BECAUSE THEY NEED THE SUPPORT OF OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT\nTO TRY TO APPREHEND HIM. IN NEW YORK, WE'RE GETTING BACK\nTO NORMAL, AND I BELIEVE THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE I BELIEVE\nTHE FUNDAMENTAL GOAL OF THESE ACTS ARE TO DISRUPT OUR LIFE,\nRIGHT? DISRUPT FREEDOM.\nDISRUPT DEMOCRACY. AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET THEM\nDO THAT.

YOU GET A SENSE OF STREETS.\nWUF GOT A BODEGA AND APARTMENTS AND HOUSES, BEAUTY SALONS.\nRESIDENTS ARE GOING TO BE FACING A LOT OF QUESTIONS IN TERMS OF\nWHO DID YOU KNOW, WHAT DID YOU SEE, WHAT DID YOU SEE IT.\nAS PEOPLE WAKE UP THIS MORNING, WE HAVE A LOT MORE FOLKS TO ASK.\nAS WE HAVE THE PICTURE FROM THE FBI, IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO\nSEE IF THEY RECOGNIZE THIS GUY AS SOMEBODY THEY EVER SAW.\n>> WE SHOULD POINT OUT AS WE LOOK AT THE IMAGE OF THE FBI AND\nTHAT'S THE MUGSHOT, THE WANTED POSTER.\n>> THE MAN THAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR.\n>> AHMAD KHAN RAHAMI. I'VE HAD A SMART PHONE FOR MANY,\nMANY YEARS, I HAVE NEVER GOTTEN ONE OF THESE FROM THE FBI.\nIT WENT OFF FIVE MINUTES AGO. EVERYBODY IN THE STUDIO GOT THE\nSAME EMERGENCY ALERT. IT SAYS THAT THIS GUY IS ARMED\nAND DANGEROUS, COULD BE. IT SAYS HE'S 5' 6\", ABOUT 2\nHUNDRED POUNDS. I WONDER WHY THEY WOULD PUT OUT\nAN EMERGENCY ALERT AT 5 MINUTES UNTIL 8:00 IN THE MORNING.\n>> HE'S SO DANGEROUS, AND YOU HAVE TO HAND IT TO OUR LAW\nENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. THIS ALL COULD BE A DIFFERENT\nSTORY THIS MORNING. OVER THE WEEKEND WE HAD TWO\nTHINGS GOING ON IN NEW YORK. WE HAD TWO THINGS GOING ON IN\nNEW JERSEY, AND NOW OFFICERS ARE ALREADY RAIDING THIS GUY'S\nAPARTMENT. THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHO HE IS AND\nTHEY ARE SHOWING US HIS PICTURE. >> LAST NIGHT, THEY WERE\nBRINGING US ALL THE LATEST NEWS. BRET JOINS US NOW GETTING SET\nFOR SPECIAL REPORT. BRET, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S\nUNFOLDING NOW. WE DO KNOW KNOW -- NOT KNOW HOW\nTHIS ENDS. >> GOOD MORNING.\nWE'RE FOLLOWING IT CLOSELY OBVIOUSLY AND THE FBI PUTTING\nOUT THAT ALERT FOR BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR THIS MAN IS\nSIGNIFICANT. ALSO HE IS A U.S. NATURALIZED\nCITIZEN FROM AFGHANISTAN. 28 YEARS OLD.\nAND MAY BE WORKING WITH OTHERS. WE HAVE SOME SOURCES SAYING THAT\nTHERE WERE VIDEOTAPES SHOWING OTHER PEOPLE IN AND AROUND\nTHERE, SO I THINK THAT THIS INVESTIGATION IS GOING TO MOVE\nQUICKLY AND WE'LL LEARN MORE THROUGHOUT THE DAY.\nTHE TIE TO NEW JERSEY, WHETHER IT WAS SIMILAR OR NOT, AND\nOBVIOUSLY ALL OF THE CONNECTIONS ALL HAPPENING IN THE SAME\nWEEKEND AS THE MINNESOTA STABBING, I THINK PEOPLE SAY,\nEXPERTS LOOK AT THIS AND SAY IT'S NOT ALL CONNECTED YET, BUT\nSOMETIMES THESE EVENTS TRIGGER OTHER EVENTS AROUND THE COUNTRY.\n>> BRET, BRIAN EARLIER IN THE SHOW WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW\nIMPORTANT IT IS TO INTERVIEW THESE INDIVIDUALS AND ASK THEM\nQUESTIONS AND WE WERE TOLD THAT THERE WERE FIVE MEN FROM\nAFGHANISTAN THAT WERE INTERVIEWED, THAT WERE TAKEN IN.\nTHEY WERE INTERVIEWED. THEY WEREN'T SUSPECTS, AND THEY\nWERE ASKING THEM QUESTIONS. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY SAID TO\nTHE OFFICERS, WHETHER OR NOT THEY TOLD THE FBI ABOUT THIS GUY\nOR IF THIS GUY WAS ONE OF THOSE FIVE.\nACTUALLY, WE KNOW HE'S NOT ONE OF FIVE.\nTHOSE FIVE ARE IN CUSTODY AND NOW WE'RE LOOKING FOR HIM.\nBUT IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO ASK QUESTIONS AND FOR PEOPLE TO STEP\nFORWARD AND COME OUT WITH ANY INFORMATION THEY KNOW ABOUT THIS\nINDIVIDUAL. >> WE DON'T INTERROGATE.\n>> IF YOU SEE IT, LOOKS SUSPICIOUS, CALL IT IN.\nTHAT'S PART OF THE DEAL. THE NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT\nIS ONE OF THE BEST IN THE COUNTRY TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW UP\nON THIS ALONG WITH THE FBI. THEY ARE WELL-POSITIONED, AND I\nBET YOU ARE GOING TO SEE MUCH MORE SECURITY PRESENCE ON THE\nSTREETS WITH THE U.N.GA IN TOWN. >> THERE WERE TWO PRESSURE\nCOOKER BOMBS. ONE EXPLODED ON 23rd STREET IN\nNEW YORK CITY, THE ONE ON 27th STREET DID NOT.\nAPPARENTLY, ACCORDING TO SOME OF THE LOCAL NEWS OUTLETS HERE IN\nNEW YORK, BRET, APPARENTLY THERE'S A HANDWRITTEN LETTER\nNEAR THE UNEXPLODED ONE, A PORTION OF IT WAS WRITTEN IN\nARABIC, WHICH MAKES YOU WONDER ALL SORTS OF THINGS.\nWE HAVE THE GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK STATE ON THE PROGRAM EARLIER AND\nASKED HIM ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF AN INTERNATIONAL CONNECTION\nAND THIS IS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY. >> TODAY, I BELIEVE, WE'RE GOING\nTO FIND OUT THAT IT WAS TARGETED BY A FOREIGN BODY, BUT YESTERDAY\nI SAID IT WAS A TERRORIST ACT. I BELIEVE IT WAS A TERRORIST\nACT. TODAY, I BELIEVE THAT WE'RE\nGOING TO FIND OUT THAT IT WAS INFLUENCED BY FOREIGN FORCES.\n>> INFLUENCED BY FOREIGN FORCES. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?\nYOU KNOW A LOT OF POLITICIANS. WHAT'S THAT MEAN?\n>> IT'S TIPTOEING THROUGH THE SEMANTICS OF WHAT IS TERRORISM,\nAND I THINK THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS\nTAPPED INTO, IS THE TALKING ABOUT THESE ACTS THAT SEEM\nCUT-AND-DRY AND SOMETIMES POLITICIANS BEING VERY HESITANT,\nESPECIALLY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND WHAT WE'VE\nSEEN SO FAR FROM HILLARY CLINTON, AND IT TAKES THEM A\nWHILE TO GET TO TERRORISM. I THINK THAT THE GOVERNOR GOT\nTHERE VERY QUICKLY, AND NOW HE'S SAYING THAT THERE MAY BE A\nBROADER, A BIGGER, KIND OF DIRECTIVE FROM SOME GROUP, ISIS,\nAL QAEDA, SOMEBODY, IN THIS CASE, AND IF THAT IS THE CASE,\nIT TAKES IT TO A DIFFERENT LEVEL THAN HOME GROWN AND INSPIRED\nISIS ATTACK. >> VERY TRUE. COUPLE STATS.\nTHERE HAVE BEEN 100,000 I UNDERSTAND SOMALIS IN OUR\nCOUNTRY SINCE 2011 AND ONE OUT OF FIVE HAVE BEEN SETTLED IN THE\nNEW YORK AREA. BY DEFINITION, WE DO NOT HAVE A\nPROPER SCREENING PROCESS TO GET THEM HERE.\nHOWEVER, DONALD TRUMP EARLIER WAS WITH US AND WE WERE TALKING\nABOUT THE DIFFERENT RESPONSE. LIKE IT OR NOT, POLITICS PLAYS A\nROLE HERE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO SEE IF THEIR NEXT\nPRESIDENT, HOW THEIR NEXT PRESIDENT WOULD HANDLE A TERROR\nATTACK. HERE'S DONALD TRUMP ON WHAT HE\nSAW FROM HILLARY. >> EVEN YOU ARE NOT GOING TO PUT\nTROOPS ON THE GROUND. YOU SHOULD NEVER SAY IT.\nSHE'S SAYING THAT BECAUSE SHE'S DESPERATE FOR VOTES.\nALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT HER POLL NUMBERS.\nIF YOU WANT WEAKNESS, SHE'S WEAK.\nI WATCHED HER IN THE AIRPLANE OVER THE WEEKEND TALKING AND I\nCOULDN'T -- I WOULD HATE TO SEE FOUR MORE -- FORGETTING ABOUT\nME, I WOULD HATE TO SEE FOUR MORE YEARS OF THOSE KIND OF\nANSWERS. >> SO THEY ARE POSTURING, RIGHT,\nBRET? >> YEAH.\nLISTEN, HE'S BOLD. IT'S WORKED FOR HIM THROUGHOUT\nTHE PRIMARY AND THE ELECTION SO FAR, SAYING IT LIKE IT IS, AND\nHILLARY WAS TRYING TO TONE THINGS THINGS DOWN, IT SEEMED,\nON THAT PLANE, TALKING TO REPORTERS AND BEING VERY, VERY\nMEASURED IN THOSE FIRST REMARKS. I DO THINK THAT SHE HAD TO CLEAN\nUP WHEN SHE SAID NO MORE U.S. TROOPS.\nTHE NEXT DAY, IF YOU REMEMBER, SHE HAD A NEWS CONFERENCE IN\nWHICH SHE SAID I'M FOR SPECIAL FORCES AND TRAINERS AND\nFACILITATORS, BUT JUST NOT MAJOR GROUND FORCES.\nTHAT WAS FROM THAT COMMANDER IN CHIEF FORUM.\nSO THIS WILL BE AN ISSUE, BRIAN, IN THE DEBATE ONE WEEK FROM NOW.\n>> ABSOLUTELY. >> WE HAD THE GOVERNOR ON\nEARLIER, BRET, AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN'T MAKE\nIT POLITICAL. HE CALLED IT TERRORISM RIGHT OUT\nOF THE GATE. THE MAYOR REFUSED TO CALL IT\nTERRORISM AND YOU HAVE TIM KAINE AND HILLARY CLINTON SAYING ISIS\nSTRIKES IN OUR CITIES MEANS WE'RE WINNING ABROAD.\n>> YEAH. IT'S A TOUGH ARGUMENT TO MAKE.\nIT MAY BE ACCURATE THAT THEY ARE BEING FORCED OUT OF CERTAIN\nAREAS OVERSEAS, BUT IT'S TOUGH FOR PEOPLE AT HOME, HOW THEY\nFEEL ABOUT THE THREAT OF TERRORISM.\nTHAT'S WHERE IT STACKS. IT IS VERY HIGH UP THERE.\nTERRORISM AND NATIONAL SECURITY, AND RIGHT NOW AS YOU MENTIONED,\nIT'S TIED BETWEEN THE TWO CANDIDATES.\nTHERE'S POLITICS IN EVERYTHING, BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS\nTHAT THEY GET THESE GUYS AND PROTECT THE STREETS OF NEW YORK\nAND NEW JERSEY. >> ABSOLUTELY.\nAND IT IS CURIOUS THAT THEY WOULD PUT OUT THE -- THE FBI\nWOULD PUT OUT THIS ALERT, WENT OFF ON OUR PHONES HERE IN THE\nSTUDIO. MY WIFE JUST SENT ME A MESSAGE.\nSHE'S OVER IN NEW JERSEY. DID NOT GO OFF IN NEW JERSEY.\n>> NOR HERE. >> DID YOU HAVE YOUR VOLUME UP?\n>> MINE DIDN'T GO OFF, BUT I DIDN'T HAVE MY VOLUME UP.\n>> IT'S REGIONAL. IT WOULD SUGGEST WE'RE LOOKING\nHERE IN NEW YORK WHERE WE'RE SITTING AND NOT NEW JERSEY.\n>> GOT IT. >> I KNOW YOU COVERED THIS KIND\nOF STUFF ON YOUR PROGRAM. THAT IS THE FIRST TIME IT'S FROM\nHILLARY CLINTON SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND SHE\nREFERRED TO THE BOMBINGS IN NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY, AND THEN I\nTHINK IT WAS CNN AND SOME OTHER NEWS OUTLETS CALLED OUT DONALD\nTRUMP FOR CALLING IT A BOMB BEFORE IT HAPPENED, AND THEN CNN\nACTUALLY TOOK HER COMMENTS AND EDITED HER SAYING BOMBING OUT,\nWHICH SEEMED LIKE ONE OF THOSE THINGS YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T\nDO. >> YEAH.\nYOU KNOW, IN THE EARLY STAGES HERE, IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE\nHOW BOTH CANDIDATES DEAL WITH IT, AND HOW NEWS ORGANIZATIONS\nDEAL WITH IT, AND I THINK THAT THAT IS PRETTY INTERESTING WHEN\nTHE FIRST COMMENTS INVOLVED HER SAYING BOMBINGS IN NEW YORK AND\nNEW JERSEY. >> WE KNOW.\nYOU WOULDN'T KNOW THAT WATCHING CNN P.\nTHANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> HAVE A GOOD DAY.\n>> I THINK THE THING THAT STANDS OUT MOST, AINSLEY, SINCE THE\nDONALD TRUMP BEEN NOMINATED, ALL THESE NETWORKS USED TO BEG HIM\nTO GO ON AND TREAT HIM IN A CERTAIN WAY.\nNOW THEY CAN NOT BE TREATING HIM WORSE.\nALL OF THEM. >> AND \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" DOES\nA DIFFERENT EXPOSE EVERY SINGLE WEEKEND ON WHAT'S WRONG WITH\nDONALD TRUMP. >> WHAT DOES THAT SAY?\n>> THERE'S A FEAR THAT HE COULD WIN.\n>> I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, THOUGH, HE PREDICTED IT.\nHE ABSOLUTELY DID PREDICT IT. >> IMAGINE IF THEY TREATED HIM\nFAIRLY, WHAT WOULD THE POM NUMBERS LOOK LIKE NOW.\n>> THAT WAS A GOOD POINT. >> OF COURSE, WE'LL NEVER KNOW.\n>> TRUE. >> ALL RIGHT.\nMEANWHILE, IF YOU ARE JUST JOINING US, WAKING UP THIS\nMORNING, THE FBI HAS JUST PUT OUT AN IMAGE, A 28-YEAR-OLD GUY\nWHO WAS BORN IN AFGHANISTAN, HE'S BEEN IN THE UNITED STATES\nFOR A NUMBER OF YEARS.

WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN AND WHAT'S\nHAPPENING. >> WE ARE AT THE SCENE OF THAT\nEXPLOSION SATURDAY NIGHT IN CHELSEA.\n28-YEAR-OLD AHMAD KAHN RAHAMI IS THE MAN POLICE AND F.B.I. ARE\nLOOKING FOR. HE'S OF AFGHAN DESCENT,\nNATURALIZED IN THE UNITED STATES.\nLIVING WITH HIS FAMILY IN NEW JERSEY.\nNEIGHBORS SAY HE WORKED AT A CHICKEN RESTAURANT OWNED BY THE\nFAMILY. HE WORKED BEHIND THE COUNTER.\nF.B.I. AGENTS RAIDING RAHAMI'S APARTMENT.\nA MILE AWAY FROM THERE BOMBS WERE FOUND IN A BACKPACK.\nONE WENT OFF AS POLICE TRIED TO DISARM IT.\nLOOK AT THE POWER OF THAT BLAST. THERE IT IS.\nJUST MOMENTS AGO, A LINE OF F.B.I. EVIDENCE GATHERERS TRYING\nTO FIND SOMETHING ON THE STREET. MAYBE SOMETHING SMALL NECESSITY\nMISSED. F.B.I. AGENTS DID PULL OVER A\nCAR OR TRUCK IN BROOKLYN ON THE BELT PARKWAY THAT HAD FIVE\nPEOPLE INSIDE OF IT, ALL CONSIDERED TO BE PERSONS OF\nINTEREST AND THEY MAY HAVE LED THE F.B.I. AND POLICE TO KAHN IN\nNEW JERSEY. YOU CAN SEAT PANIC IN CHELSEA\nAND SEE PEOPLE RUNNING FOR THEIR LIVES.\nPEOPLE WERE TERRIFIED, A MORE ICIAL SCENE, THANK THINK NOBODY\nWAS KILLED. BILL: THERE IS A REPORT FROM\nRIGHTERS THAT MORE PEOPLE WERE INVOLVED THAN THE PICTURE OF THE\n28-YEAR-OLD WE PUT ON THE AIR. REPORTER: INVESTIGATORS ARE\nSAYING THERE IS GOING TO BE MORE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THIS.\nTHEY ARE STILL LOOK FOR MORE PEOPLE.\nWE HAVE VIDEO OF WHAT COULD BE TWO PEOPLE GETTING INTO THAT BAG\nYOU MENTIONED. THAT BOMB FOUR BLOCKS THAT\nDIDN'T GO OFF. TWO PEOPLE GOT THAT BAG, SO\nTHAT'S AT LEAST 6. IT COULD BE A CELL OR A NETWORK.\nBUT WITH THE U.N. IN TOWN, RAHAMI IS SOMEBODY THEY WANT TO\nGET CAUGHT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. BILL: THANKS, ROB.\nMARTHA: JOINING US NOW IS RETIRED NAVY LIEUTENANT\nCOMMANDER STEVE ROGERS. HE'S A FORMER MEMBER OF THE\nJOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCE. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE\nRESPONSE? TERMS OF HOW THE PUBLIC HAS\nRESPONDED. IT SEEMS MUTED IN SOME WAYS.\nYOU WONDER IF WE ARE JUST GETTING USED TO THIS.\n>> WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS A COORDINATED WAR BEING WAGED\nAGAINST THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE BEEN ATTACKED BEFORE.\nBUT THIS SEEMS LIKE A COORDINATED ATTEMPT TO STRIKE AT\nUS. THIS IS SOMETHING WE FEARED.\nBUT WE KNEW AT SOME POINT IN TIME IT WOULD HAPPEN.\nLET'S TALK ABOUT THAT RESPONSE. THE RESPONSE EXTRAORDINARY.\nNO QUESTION ABOUT IT. RESPONSE FROM THE PUBLIC.\nWE SAY IF YOU SEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING.\nMOST OF THESE LEADS HAVE BEEN GIVEN BY PEOPLE MONTH WHO SAW\nSOMETHING AND SAID SOMETHING. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE RESPONSE\nFROM THE WHITE HOUSE. HE HASN'T SPOKEN TO GOVERNOR\nCUOMO YET, I DON'T KNOW IF HE TALKED TO GOVERNOR CHRISTIE.\nSOME OF OUR NATIONAL REPRESENTATIVES CAN'T COME TO\nGRIPS WITH THE FACT THIS IS A TERRORIST ATTACK.\nWE ARE SEEING A WAR BEING WAGED AGAINST THIS COUNTRY AND OUR\nLEADERS NEED TO STEP UP. MARTHA: THIS DEVICE COULD BE A\nFLOWN WOLF. I READ AT STATEMENT PUT OUT IN\nONE OF THE ISIS PUBLIC RELATIONS FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD\nMISSIVE WHICH SAYS IF YOU CAN'T COME HERE, YOU HAVE TO DO\nSOMETHING AT HOME. WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT TO TIE\nTHIS TO SOMETHING THAT IS LARGER THAN POTENTIALLY ONE CRAZY GUY\nAND RELATIVES IN NEW JERSEY. >> WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE WHAT WE\nCALL HUMAN INTELLIGENCE TO GET THAT INFORMATION OUT OF\nSOMEBODY, YOU DON'T KNOW. HOWEVER, SAYING THAT, WE KNOW\nTHERE ARE SIX PEOPLE AT A MINIMUM INVOLVED.\nIT MAY BE A CELL OR NETWORK. WHAT WE HAVE TO KNOW IS IF IN\nFACT THIS WAS A TERRORIST ACT BY OVERSEAS DIRECTION, THIS CELL\nGET DIRECTIONS FROM AN OVERSEAS ENTITY?\nAND IF THEY DID, WHETHER IT BE ISIS OR ANOTHER TYPE OF\nORGANIZATION OVERSEAS, WE MAY HAVE MORE CELLS READY TO BE\nACTIVATED. THESE ARE COMING CLOSER\nAND CLOSER TO OUR ELECTION. IT APPEARS THEY MAY BE TARGETING\nOUR ELECTION TO DISRUPT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THIS COUNTRY\nIN NOVEMBER. IT'S A DIFFICULT AND DAUNTING\nTASK. WE HAVE TO STOP THE POLITICAL\nCORRECTNESS AND SANITIZING INFORMATION FROM OUR LEADERS.\nWE NEED TO MAKE SURE THE TRUTH BE TOLD.\nMARTHA: EVERYBODY WATCHED THIS UNFOLD SATURDAY NIGHT.\nTHERE WAS A BOMB DEVICE FOUND IN AND TRASH CAN AND TWO THAT ARE\nBLOCKS APART IN MANHATTAN, AND PEOPLE ARE TELLING YOU, WE DON'T\nSEE ANY CONNECTION. EVERYBODY WATCHING ARE SAYING\nHOW COULD IT NOT BE CONNECTED? IT'S OBVIOUS.\n>> THOSE OF US WHO MADE A CAREER OUT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND\nINTELLIGENCE. WE KNEW RIGHT AWAY.\nYOU HAVE A COOKER PRESSURE. THEN AND BOMB ON 23rd.\nTHEN IT'S AN UNKNOWN FACTOR, THE INCIDENT IN MINNESOTA.\nTHE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, WE ARE AT WAR AND WE START -- WE\nBETTER START FIGHTING THIS AS A WAR.\nMARTHA: IN TERMS OF THE DEVICES, SIMILAR TO WHAT WE SAW AND\nCONSTRUCTION AND ANYBODY'S ABILITY TO MAKE IT?\n>> THE PRESSURE COOKER. YOU CAN GET ON THE INTERNET AND\nLEARN HOW TO MAKE THESE DEVICES OFF ANY INTERNET-TYPE ENTITY.\nBUT WHAT WE HAVE IS THE COORDINATION OF THIS ATTACK.\nTHIS IS A WELL-COORDINATED ATTACK.\nMY CONCERN IS THERE ARE MORE OUT THERE.\nTHEY HAVE GOT TO GET THIS GUY. IN REGARDS TO THE SEARCH WARRANT\nEXECUTED THIS MORNING. THE TIMING IS INTERESTING.\nBUT THE STOP THE POLICE MADE LAST NIGHT, IT SEEMS TO ME THEY\nDID GET SOME CRITICAL INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION THAT\nALLOWED THEM TO GET ENOUGH PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THE JUDGE TO\nAGREE TO A SEARCH WARRANT. THAT WAS GOOD POLICE WORK.\nMARTHA: AND GOOD CIVILIAN WORK, THE GUISE WHO SPOTTED THE\nBACKPACK IN THE GARBAGE CAN. EVERYBODY HAS TO BE SO HYPER\nALERT. >> IF YOU SEE THIS GUY OR ANYONE\nYOU THINK IS INVOLVED IN TERRORISM, DO NOT TAKE THE LAW\nINTO YOUR OWN HANDS. THESE ARE DANGEROUS PEOPLE.\nTHEY MAY END UP MARTYRING THEMSELVES.\nMARTHA: YOU KNOW IN BOSTON, THE TSARNAEV BROTHERS, THE F.B.I.\nPUT THEIR PICTURES UP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nBILL: THE NATION ON EDGE. WHAT IS THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING\nSO FAR. MARTHA: THE PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATES WITH DIFFERENT TAKES WHEN THIS WAS UNFOLDING.\nDONALD TRUMP SLAMMING HILLARY CLINTON SAYING THIS IS NO TIME\nTO WORRY ABOUT WHAT HE CALLS POLITICAL CORRECTNESS.\n>> DO WE REALLY HAVE A CHOICE? WE ARE TRYING TO BE SO\nPOLITICALLY CORRECT IN OUR COUNTRY.\nAND THIS IS ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE.\nTHIS ISN'T GOING TO GET BETTER. THIS IS ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE.", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1474296709054.1474293815884.68c53dae-8134-403c-ad11-23b391c7ed51.segment0.thumb.jpg", "channel": "360"}], "channel": "360"}], "value": 24, "summary": "know-would-right-something-see-well-say-get", "words": [{"text": "know", "size": 2514}, {"text": "would", "size": 5109}, {"text": "right", "size": 3823}, {"text": "something", "size": 4192}, {"text": "see", "size": 3972}, {"text": "well", "size": 5020}, {"text": "say", "size": 3920}, {"text": "get", "size": 1938}], "images": [], "id": 57}, {"segments": [{"videos": [{"start": 374517, "length": 61695.0, "end": 436212, "date": 1474281305256, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1474284659377.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1474281150722-ea3eeaa5-55c1-4f51-9a2b-adf4eef4a0a9-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=374.52,436.21", "text": "MILLER, FOX25 NEWS.\n>>> ISIS IS NOW TAKING\nRESPONSIBILITY FOR AN ATTACK IN A MINNESOTA MALL, BUT U.S.\nOFFICIALS SAY THEY DON'T ARE\nTHAT KONLD FIRMED.

HOWEVER, THEY HAVE NOT CONCLUDED\nTHAT THE INCIDENTS ARE CONNECTED ACCORDING TO SOURCES TALKING TO\nOUR JOURNALISTS HERE. OUR EXPERT RS FOLLOWING THESE\nSTORIES. I WANT TO START WITH DEB\nFAYERICK AS SHE IS AT THE SUSTAIN OF THE YORK BOMBING.\nWHAT MORE ARE YOU LEARN SOMETHING.\n>> THE TWO BIG QUESTIONS ARE WHO AND WHY.\nTHERE ARE TWO SEPARATE CRIME SCENE, ONE HERE BEHIND ME.\nABOUT A BLOCK AND A HALF. YOU'VE GOT TEAMS OF FORENSIC\nINVESTIGATORS. I WALKED BY THEM EARLIER AND\nTHEY ARE COLLECTING EVIDENCE OF THE GROUND.\nTHEY HAVE NUMBERED PIECE OF SHARP NELL.\nTHAT'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE ANALYZED AT QUANTICO, WHERE IT'S\nBEING TAKEN TO DETERMINE IF IT WAS FROM THE RESULTING\nEXPLOSION. IT COULD BE SOMETHING RANDOM.\nTHINK ABOUT THE BOSTON MARATHON BOMBING WHEN WIRES WERE FOUND\nWITH PIECES OF THE PRESSURE COOKER.\nAS FAR AS THE 27th STREET INCIDENT, THE REASON THAT DEVICE\nWAS UNCOVERED IS BECAUSE AFTER THE EXPLOSION TOOK PLACE HERE,\nPOLICE DID A SWEEP OF THE ENTIRE AREA.\nAND TWO OFFICERS ON FOOT WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THAT GAS PRICE\nDWOOIS AND IT'S MORE CRITICAL ON SOME LEVELS BECAUSE IT DID NOT\nGO OFF. WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT WAS\nOPERATIONAL. IT COULD MEAN THERE'S DNA\nEVIDENCE, A FINGERPRINT, PIECE OF HAIR, SOMETHING ON THE TAPE\nOR WIRES USED TO CREATE THAT. SO THAT'S CRITICAL AND THE BOMB\nSQUAD HAS BEEN WORKING ON THAT DEVICE ALL AFTERNOON TO\nDETERMINE SPECIFICALLY WHAT IT WAS.\nAND SO, WE'RE WAITING FOR INFORMATION ON THAT.\nWE CAN TELL YOU POLICE KNOW THAT THIS WAS INTENTIONAL.\nTHEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE MOTIVATION IS.\nNOR DO THEY KNOW WHY IT HAPPENED HERE IN CHELSEA.\nAND POLICE ARE NOW LOOKING AT VIDEO SURVEILLANCE TAKEN FROM A\nLOT OF STORES, A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE BEEN WALKING BY AND\nSCENE SOMETHING. THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO\nDETERMINE. THEY DON'T KNOW WHY THE DEVICE\nWAS PLACED IN THE DUMPSTER AND SO THAT'S ALSO CRITICAL BECAUSE\nA SQUAD CAR MARKED SQUAD CAR WAS JUST A BLOCK AWAY WHEN THE\nDEVICE DETONATED, SO THEY DON'T KNOW WHO'S OUT THERE AND WHO MAY\nHAVE CONE THIS. THAT'S WHY THE FBI AND NYPD ARE\nPLAYING THIS VERY CLOSE BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO GIVE AWAY ANY\nCLUES ACCIDENTALLY THAT COULD PERHAPS LEAD THE PERSONS\nRESPONSIBLE TO REALIZE THAT THEY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN TERMS OF\nWHO THEY MIGHT BE LOOKING FOR. SECURITY HERE, ESPECIALLY TIGHT.\nTHE NEW COMMISSIONER SAYING THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY WAS EXPECTED\nSTARTING TOMORROW AND SO, SECURITY WAS GOING TO BE TIGHT\nANY WAY. BUT NOW, IT'S TO BE A LOT MORE\nIN TERMS OF THE LEVEL OF ALERTNESS BECAUSE THIS HAS\nHAPPENED. SO VERY ACTIVE KRAM SEEN.\nTHOSE INVESTIGATORS PICK I GUESS UP EVERY PIECE OF -- AND PERHAPS\nEVEN WHO THEY ARE. >> PICKING UP THE PIECES AS YOU\nSAY, LOOKING FOR ANY MORE FORENSIC EVIDENCE.\nOUR VEST INVESTIGATORS SAYING ANYTHING MORE ABOUT WHY THEY\nSUSPECT THIS AREA WAS TARGETED. >> WELL, AND THAT'S EXACTLY\nRIGHT. THAT IS THE BIG QUESTION.\nYOU KNOW, WE ARE JUST ABOUT A BLOCK AND A HALF AWAY FROM WHERE\nTHE DEVICE DETONATED AND EVEN THOUGH TCHELSEA ON A SATURDAY\nNIGHT IS VERY, VERY BUSY, THE AREA WHERE THE DUMPSTER WAS\nLOCATED AND DEVICE EXPLODED, IT'S A LOT LESS BUSY THAN THE\nAREA I'M AT RIGHT NOW. AND INTERESTINGLY, WHETHER THE\nPERSON WAS CARRYING OR PLACED IT THERE AND GOT SPOOKED, THAT'S\nUNDER VINVESTIGATION. THAT DUMPSTER MAY HAVE BLUNTED\nTHE IMPACT OF THE BOMB AND THEREFORE, CAUSED FEWER\nINJURIES. NOW, NOT MINIMIZING THE NUMBER,\nTHERE ARE ABOUT 29 PEOPLE WHO WENT TO BELLEVUE HOSPITAL, BUT\nBECAUSE IT EXPLODED IN A DUMPSTER AND NOT ON THE STREET,\nAGAIN, IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF EXPLOSION THAN IT MAY\nHAVE BEEN OTHERWISE. >> ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU SO MUCH.\nKEEP US POSTED. WE'RE ALSO NOW SEEING NEW\nPICTURES OF THE MOMENT OF THE AFTERMATH OF LAST NIGHT'S\nEXPLOSION. WHAT ARE WE SEEING?\n>> IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE AS LIFE KIND OF SLOWLY TURNS BACK\nTO NORMAL IN THAT VICINITY, BUSINESS OWNER RS GETTING BACK\nINTO THEIR STORES AND TURNING OVER THE SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE,\nWHICH WILL BE CRUCIAL TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INVESTIGATORS IN\nPUTTING THE PIECES OF THE PUZZLE TOGETHER AND WE JUST GOT FOOTAGE\nFROM A BUSINESS OWNER, A BARBERSHOP ON 23rd STREET AND IF\nYOU LOOK IT, YOU'LL SEE A WOMAN WHO IS CLEANING THERE.\nNOW, YOU'RE SEEING PEOPLE RUNNING LIKE SHE WAS CLEANINGING\nAND SHE'S GETTING UP, CLEARLY NOTICING THE EXPLOSION.\nAND THE PEOPLE SORT OF RUNNING AWAY FROM IT.\nIT GETS TO THIS IDEA OF THE CONFUSION ON THE GROUND, MOST\nPEOPLE YOU KNOW IN THE VICINITY WERE AT RISK OF BEING HIT BY THE\nDEBRIS AS A RESULT OF THE EXPLOSION.\nTHEY SUFFERED INJURY, YOU KNOW, BEING HIT WITH GLASS AND METAL\nTHAT FLEW OFF OF DOORS AND WINDOWS.\nTHOSE ARE WITH KINDS OF INJURIES WE WERE SEEING AND HEAR ING ABOT\nAT BELLEVUE EARLIER TODAY. ALSO, MY COLLEAGUE SPOKE TO A\nMAN WHO WAS DRIVING AND LOST CONTROL OF THE CAR AS A RESULT\nOF THE EDUCATION PLOEGS TAKE A LISTEN.\n>> I CAN TELL YOU VAGUELY WHAT I REMEMBER.\nDRIVING A CAR. AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW, I FELT\nAN EXPLOSION AND THE CAR JUST TILTED OVER.\nHALFWAY. CAME BACK DOWN.\nWHAT HAPPENED WAS I JUST BLACKED OUT.\nNEXT THING YOU KNOW, I'M IN AN AMBULANCE!\nWHAT ABOUT YOU? >> EVERYTHING WAS SO SUDDEN AND\nFAST. IT WAS MORE OF A SHOCK.\nTHAN I REMEMBER. >> HOW ARE YOU DOING NOW?\n>> PAIN. YOU KNOW, LITTLE TRAUMATIZED.\nI WAS CLOSE TO NOT ACTUALLY SEEING MY SON AGAIN.\nTHAT WAS THE SCARIEST PART OF THE NIGHT FOR ME.\n>> FRED RICKA, LUCKILY, MANY PEOPLE WALKED OUT OF THE\nHOSPITAL. IN FACT, SEVERAL HOURS AFTER\nTHAT INTERVIEW, GOVERNOR CUOMO SAID THAT ALL OF THE 24 PEOPLE\nTHAT WERE TREATED IN THE WERE SKENTLY RELEASEDED, WHICH IS\nQUITE REMARKABLE IF YOU THINK ABOUT HOW CROWDED, HOW POPULATED\nTHAT SPECIFIC SPECIFIC AREA IS AND THE FORCE THAT EXPLOSION\nTHAT THE DESTRUCTION THAT IT CAUSED BECAUSE OF THE FORCE.\nYOU PUT THESE TWO THINGS TOGETHER, YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT\nTHERE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE PEOPLE.\nLUCKILY, NEW YORKERS ARE VERY RELIEVED TONIGHT THAT THE DAMAGE\nIN TERMS OF PEOPLE AT LEAST IS MINIMAL.\n>> RIGHT. AND JUST LOOKING AT THE VIDEO\nHERE, CLEARLY, A VARIETY OF VICTIM FRS THE ELDERLY TO THE\nVERY YOUNG. VERY CLOSE CALL FOR SO MANY.\n29 INJURED AGAIN. ALL RELEASED FROM HOSPITALS.\nNONE LIFE THREATENING. THAT IS GOOD NEWS.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH. SO, THE FBI IS NOW CALLING THE\nSTABBING ATTACK AT A SHOPPING MALL IN ST. CLOUD, MINNESOTA, A\nPOTENTIAL ACT OF TERRORISM. NINE PEOPLE WERE STABBED.\nTHREE OF THEM REMAIN HOSPITALIZED.\nTHE SUSPECT WAS SHOT DEAD BY AN OFF DUTY POLICE OFFICER.\nISIS NOW CLAIMING THE ATTACK WAS CARRIED OUT BY A QUOTE, SOLDIER\nOF THE ISLAMIC STATE, END QUOTE. WITNESSES SAID HE WAS WEARING A\nPRIVATE SECURITY COMPANY UNIFORM.\nAND MADE REFERENCES TO ALLA DURING THE ATTACK.\nNICK VALENCIA IS FOLLOWING THIS FOR US.\nWHAT MORE ARE INVESTIGATORS WILLING TO SAY?\n>> THEY'RE HIGHLIGHTING THIS VALIANT EFFORT AND HEROICS OF\nTHE OFF DUTY POLICE OFFICER WHO ENGAGED THE SUSPECT, FIRING AT\nHIM MULTIPLE TIMES. THE SUSPECT GETTING UP ON THREE\nVARIOUS TIMES BEFORE HE WAS FINALLY NEUTRALIZED.\nTHE FBI UNWILLING TO CONFIRM THAT THIS IS AN ACT OF TERRORISM\nONLY INVESTIGATING IT SO FAR A AS A POTENTIAL ACT OF TERRORISM.\nWE HEARD ALSO FROM THE POLICE CHIEF THERE IN ST. CLOUD.\nMENTIONING THE IRONY THAT THIS ALSO TOOK PLACE ON THE SAME\nNIGHT WE SAW EXPLOSIONS IN NEW JERSEY AS WELL AS NEW YORK.\nTHERE IS NO APPARENT LINK SO FAR.\nBUT THEY ARE LOOK ING AT THE SIMILARITIES, THEY ARE LOOKING\nAT THE FACT THIS TOOK PLACE ON THE VERY SAME DAY.\nNOT MUCH KNOWN ABOUT THE SUSPECT.\nHE HAS NOT BEEN OFFICIALLY IDED, BUT HE HAS HAD THREE ENCOUNTERS\nIN PAST FOR POLICE OFFICER, ALL MINOR TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS.\nWE KNOW THAT WHILE HE WAS CARRYING OUT THESE STABBINGS, HE\nWAS ASKING ONE INDIVIDUAL IF HE WAS A MUSLIM BEFORE HE WAS\nSTABBEDED. ALSO MENTIONING ALLA.\nOF COURSE, THE MEDIA WING FOR ISIS ONLINE TAKING CREDIT FOR\nTHIS. SAYING HE WAS A SOLDIER OF ISIS.\nCNN HAS NO WAYS, IS UNABLE TO AUTHENTICATE THIS CLAIM, BUT I\nMENTIONED THE FBI IS INVESTIGATING THIS AS POSSIBLE\nPOTENTIAL ACT OF TERRORISM. EAR\nEARLIER, I SPOKE TO A WITNESS THERE AT THE MALL WHEN THIS\nATTACK HAPPENED. >> AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, CHAOS\nJUST BROKE OUT. THERE WAS A BUNCH OF PEOPLE\nRUNNING IN INTO THE J.C. PENNY MALL ENTRANCE AND THEY WERE JUST\nCREAM SKROOEM THAG SOMEONE WAS GOING AROUND THE MALL STABBING\nPEOPLE AND THAT THERE WAS BLOOD EVERYWHERE.\nAND IT WAS JUST HONESTLY A REALLY SCARY EXPERIENCE.\nI DROPPED EVERYTHING IN MY HANDS AND BOOKEDED IT BACK THE MY\nCO-WORKERS TO NOTIFY HER OF WHAT WAS GOING ON.\nI RAN OUT A DIFFERENT EXIT OUT OF OUR J.C. PENNY'S, WHICH LED\nSTRAIGHT TO THE PARKING LOT AND I JUST JUMPED IN MY CAR AND SPED\nOFF AS FAST AS I COULD. >> A WITNESS OF WHAT HAPPENED\nYESTERDAY IN ST. CLOUD, MINNESOTA, SHE SAID SHE'S HAD A\nLOT OF TROUBLE SLEEPING AFTER WITNESSES WHAT SHE SAW.\nNINE STABBED, THREE REMAIN HOSPITALIZED AND THEY RANGE IN\nAGE FROM 15 YEARS OLD TO 53 YEARS OLD.\nTHIS INVESTIGATE CONTINUES THERE AT THE MALL.\nIT REMAINS CLOSED.

THE MOST RECENT ELIZABETH AT\nTHIS TRAIN STATION FOUND LAST NIGHT AND THE CHELSEA\nNEIGHBORHOOD IN MANHATTAN AND SEASIDE PARK IN NEW JERSEY ALONG\nTHE ROUTE OF WHAT WAS A CHARITY RUN.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK THE SIGNIFICANCE IS DO YOU THINK\nTHEY ARE COORDINATED? >> I THINK WE DON'T KNOW YET.\nI'LL TAKE THE FACTS AND TELL YOUR VIEWERS ABOUT THE\nCONNECTION. I THINK NO QUESTION IF WE JUST\nSTART FROM THE BEGINNING OR START FROM THE MIDDLE, WHICH IS\nTHE NEW YORK ATTACKS ON 23rd AND 27th.\nYOU HAVE THE SAME INDIVIDUAL AND VERY SIMILAR BOMBS.\nGOING BACK A DAY TO NEW JERSEY. STARTING THE WEEKEND, ALL WE\nHAVE HEARD IS THAT THERE ARE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN NEW JERSEY\nAND NEW YORK. BUT WE DON'T KNOW IF MATERIALS\nFOUND IN THE BOMBS ON SATURDAY ARE THE SAME IN NEW YORK ARE THE\nSAME AS THOSE IN NEW JERSEY. THOSE INCLUDE ALUMINUM POWER AND\nT T\nTANARITE AND THOSE ARE THINGS THAT ARE EASILY PURCHASED\nANYWHERE. WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THE\nEXPLOSIVES BUT COINCIDENCES LIKE THIS DON'T HAPPEN VERY OFTEN.\nIF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS IN THE TOTALITY, YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IT\nOVER THE COURSE OF THE WEEKEND. WHAT WE HAVE ON THE\nINVESTIGATION SIDE IS, OBVIOUSLY, THE SAME PERSON ON\nSATURDAY NIGHT, AS YOU GUYS REPORTED LAST NIGHT.\nAND VIDEO SURVEILLANCE AT VARIOUS PLACES THAT MAY HELP.\nRIGHT NOW INVESTIGATORS ARE DEPENDENT ON MATERIALS IN TERMS\nOF CONNECTING THE THINGS AND SURVEILLANCE.\nAND THAT'S ESSENTIALLY HOW THIS WILL UNFOLD.\nYOU KNOW, THERE'S THESE GUYS THAT ARE NOW JUST STOPPED IN THE\nCAR AND WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH TO SIMPLY MAKE SPECULATION OF WHAT\nTHAT IS. THAT'S WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW.\n>> MOVING VERY QUICKLY. DIFFERENT STATES, OBVIOUSLY, ALL\nWORKING IN COORDINATION WITH THE FEDS ON THIS.\nTHEY DO BELIEVE THERE'S SIMILARITIES AND DETONATION\nTECHNIQUES VERY CRUDE ONES FOUND ON THE INTERNET OR MAGAZINE\nWHERE YOU CAN FIND TO DO THIS KIND OF STUFF.\nYOU HAVE THREE PHASES. HOW THE PROSECUTORS ARE LOOKING\nAT IT, WHICH IS WHERE YOUR MIND GOES.\nHOW THE INVESTIGATORS LOOK AT THIS AND WE HAVE PHIL MUDD FOR\nTHAT AND THE LARGER MOTIVATIONS HERE AND WE HAVE MICHAEL FOR\nTHAT. PHIL, WHEN YOU'RE SIZING UP THIS\nINVESTIGATION, MULTIPLE EVENTS POPPING UP AND SIMILAR IN TERMS\nOF WHAT THESE PEOPLE DID TO PUT THE BOMBS AND HOW THEY LOOK.\nWHAT ARE THE PHASES? >> LOOK, THE FIRST PHASE IS\nOPENING UP THE FACTS. I THIRD PEOPLE, FOR EXAMPLE,\nTALK ABOUT THIS IS TERRORISM. THAT IS NOT A FACT, CHRIS.\nTHE FACT IS WE HAVE DEVICES AND THE FBI LABS SHOULD BE ABLE TO\nTELL VERY QUICKLY WHETHER, FOR EXAMPLE, THE WIRING IN THOSE\nDEVICES INDICATES THE SAME INDIVIDUAL WIRED BOTH OF THEM.\nWE HAVE VIDEO AND WE HAVE CALL INS.\nYOU MIGHT HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT A STOP OF SOME SUSPECTS OR PERSONS\nOF INTEREST. AND LICENSE PLATES FROM VEHICLES\nTHAT WERE GOING THROUGH THE AREA.\nSO, WE'RE SPECULATING ON WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED HERE BUT\nINSIDE THIS GAME INVESTIGATORS IF YOU LISTEN TO THE LAST MOMENT\nOF CONVERSATION, INVESTIGATORS HAVE A LARGE VOLUME OF DATA THAT\nTHEY'RE ALREADY STARTING TO SORT THROUGH.\nTHAT WILL TAKE THEM A COUPLE DAYS, CHRIS, BEFORE THE FACTS\nNARROW DOWN. >> HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT\nBECAUSE COMMON SENSE TELLS YOU, SOMEBODY'S DOING THIS TO DISRUPT\nOUR WAY OF LIFE. IT'S A HOMICIDAL ACT WITHOUT A\nSPECIFIC TARGET. IT'S TERRORISM.\nYOU'RE SAYING, NO. IS THAT THE MIND OF THE\nINVESTIGATOR BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO MAKE A CASE AS SUCH?\n>> NO, IT'S BECAUSE TERRORISM REQUIRES A POLITICAL MOTIVATION\nAND I DON'T KNOW THE MOTIVATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL.\nLET'S ASSUME, FOR EXAMPLE, A MALE WHO LOST HIS GIRLFRIEND AND\nWANT TO BLOW UP A BLOCK. IF YOU WANT TO TELL ME YOU KNOW\nWHAT THIS PERSON WAS TRYING TO DO, I WOULD TELL YOU, HOW WOULD\nYOU KNOW THAT? I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT THE\nMOTIVATION WAS AND WHETHER THIS WAS AN ACT OF TERROR BEFORE I\nUNDERSTAND WHAT WAS IN HIS MIND OR HER MIND.\n>> MICHAEL, NO CLAIM OF RESPONSIBILITY FROM ISIS.\nWHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO YOU? >> NOTHING.\n>> THIS COULD BE, AS PHIL WAS POINTING OUT, SOME GRIEVED\nLUNETIC WHO WANTED TO KILL AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT\nANY POLITICAL MOTIVATION. IF IT WAS JIHADIISIS HAS TWO\nMAIN TACTICS THEY CHOOSE FROM. ONE IS THE ISIS DIRECTED ATTACK\nSUCH AS PARIS AND BRUSSELS AND NICE AND THE OTHER IS THE\nISIS-INSPIRED ATTACK OR THE LONE  THE ISIS SPOKESMAN THAT THE\nCOALITION KILLED A COUPLE WEEKS IN 2014 CAME OUT WITH THIS,\nBASICALLY A GLOBAL INJUNCTION TO ALL MUSLIMS TO KILL THE INFIDEL\nWHEREVER YOU TAKE HIM. DRIVE OVER HIM, TAKE A KNIFE AND\nSTAB HIM. THESE ARE THE INDIVIDUAL\nSOLDIERS OF IT. NOW, ISIS MAY NOT KNOW IF THIS\nWAS ISIS-INSPIRED YET. THEY DID COME OUT OR CLAIM\nRESPONSIBILITY. THEY ARE NOT THE ONLY JIHADIST\nORGANIZATION. WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH YET ABOUT\nNEW YORK. MINNESOTA, I'M MORE INCLINED TO\nSAY IT'S -- >> LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.\nTHAT WAS A MALL ATTACK THAT SOMEBODY CLAIMED -- I THINK THAT\nIS ISIS-INSPIRED AND HE WAS ABLE TO STAND MULTIPLE PEOPLE BEFORE\nBEING KILLED. >> THAT IS MORE ISIS-DIRECTED.\nHE CAME OUT AND SAID HE'S A SOLDIER OF AN ISLAMIC STATE THAT\nSUGGESTS THEY PROBABLY KNEW AND WHAT WORRIES ME IS I INTERVIEW\nPEOPLE WITHIN ISIS AND A FEW MONTHS AGO A GUY I PROFILED IN\n\"THE DAILY BEAST\" A MEMBER OF THEIR SPY SERVICE, THE STATE\nSECURITY OR THE FBI OF ISIS HAS INFORMANTS PLACED WITHIN ISIS\nINCLUDING IN THE FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE BRANCH WHICH PLANS\nTHESE ATTACKS OVERSEAS. HE TOLD ME IN THE NEXT THREE\nMONTHS OR SO THEY'RE PLANNING SOMETHING IN MINNESOTA.\nSPECIFICALLY GOING BE FROM THE SOMALI, WE CAN'T CONFIRM THIS,\nBUT LOCAL REPORTING IN MINNESOTA SUGGESTS THIS GUY WAS A\n22-YEAR-OLD AND BORN IN KENYA BUT OF SOMALI BACKGROUND.\nI SHARE THIS INFORMATION WITH THE FBI AND THEY SAID, THANKS,\nWE'LL LOOK INTO IT AND NEVER REALLY HEARD BACK FROM THEM.\n>> YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS IN DIFFERENT PHASES.\nI GET THAT IT'S FRUSTRATING FOR PEOPLE.\nEVEN THIS TERRORISM QUESTION. IT'S A VERY STRAIGHT SHOT FOR\nPHILIP MUDD. JULIET, WE DEAL WITH THIS ALL\nTHE TIME AND WE GET IT. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO\nNONINVESTIGATIVE PEOPLE. WHO ELSE PLANTS BOMBS IN RANDOM\nAREAS WHERE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE OTHER THAN SOMEBODY WHO IS UP\nTO NO GOOD AND AFFECT OUR WAY OF LIFE.\nWHY ISN'T THAT ENOUGH? IS THE DISTINCTION BECAUSE\nYOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO INTO COURT AND MAKE A CASE AND IT\nCAN'T BE IT FEELS LIKE SOMETHING?\n>> IT'S ALL OF THE ABOVE. LOOK, NONE OF US ARE QUESTIONING\nTHE TERROR OCCURRED IN PARTICULAR.\nYOU KNOW, ON SATURDAY MORNING, SATURDAY NIGHT AND FEAR OF\nTERROR. THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN A\nPROSECUTOR NEEDING TO MAKE A TERRORISM CASE AND REITERATING\nWHAT WE SAID ALL WEEK. WE DON'T KNOW WHO THE CULPRITS\nARE. A NUMBER OF MOTIVATIONS.\nTHEY MAY SEEM OBVIOUS TO US THAT THIS IS A POLITICALLY MOTIVATED.\nWE TALK ABOUT STAITERROR AND IS AND YOU DON'T WANT INVESTIGATORS\nGOING INTO AN INVESTIGATION ASSUMING TOO MUCH BECAUSE YOU'RE\nGOING TO MISS CLUES. THAT'S WHY YOUR ANALYSTS ARE\nSAYING, LOOK AT THE FACTS. THE FACTS GIVE YOU A LOT AND\nTHEN WE GO FROM THERE. >> PANEL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH\nFOR ALL OF YOUR EXPEER RTEXPERT. WE WILL HAVE NEW INFORMATION AS\nIT DEVELOPS THROUGHOUT THE HOUR.", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1474284319969.1474281128337.aebbdfac-bfc1-4dc6-8d8e-0b65be9de187.segment3.thumb.jpg", "channel": "202"}, {"start": 928086, "length": 453252.0, "end": 1381338, "date": 1474297520878, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1474297357212.2f78d7ba-c263-47f9-a7f5-a699c719e051.mp4#t=928.09,1381.34", "text": ">>> I WANT TO PUT UP THIS MAN'S\nPICTURE ONE MORE TIME AS LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS ARE\nLOOKING FOR THEM.

SO IF YOU SEE THIS MAN, IF YOU\nKNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS MAN, PLEASE CALL THE FBI.\nTHE NUMBER TO CALL IS 1-800-577-TIPS.\nAND OPERATORS ARE STANDING BY. SO PLEASE, IT'S IMPORTANT.\nWE ALSO KNOW THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO OFFICIALS SAY WENT ON A\nSTABBING RAMPAGE OVER THE WEEKEND AT A MINNESOTA MALL.\nFEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS SAY HE IS 22-YEAR-OLD\nTAHIR OR DAHIR ADAN. AN OFF-DUTY POLICE OFFICER SHOT\nHIM TO DEATH. AND THE NEWS AGENCY IS NOW\nCALLING ADANA SOLDIER OF THE ISLAMIC STATE.\nAND THE FBI IS INVESTIGATING THE ATTACK AS POTENTIAL TERRORISM.\nROSA FLORES IS LIVE WITH MORE. HI, ROSA.\n>> Reporter: GOOD MORNING, CAROL.\nA LOT OF DEVELOPMENTS HERE. LET ME START WITH THE LATEST\nFROM POLICE. THEY, OF COURSE, HAVE BEEN\nINVESTIGATING THIS STABBING SPREE OVER THE WEEKEND ON\nSATURDAY. JUST IMAGINE, POLICE SAY THAT A\nMAN DRESSED IN A PRIVATE SECURITY FIRM UNIFORM ENTERED\nINTO THE MALL AND MADE SOME SORT OF REFERENCE TO ALLAH, ASKED\nSEVERAL PEOPLE IF THEY WERE MUSLIMS AND THEN STARTED\nATTACKING PEOPLE AT THAT MALL WITH A KNIFE.\nNOW, POLICE ARE NOT IDENTIFYING HIM JUST YET, BUT, HOWEVER,\nCOMMUNITY LEADERS HERE IN MINNESOTA WHO ARE IN CONTACT\nWITH THE FAMILY HAVE RELEASED HIS NAME.\nAND AS CAROL MENTIONED, HIS NAME IS DAHIR ADAN.\n22 YEARS OLD. HE WENT TO SCHOOL IN THIS\nCOMMUNITY, HE WORKED IN THIS COMMUNITY FOR A PRIVATE SECURITY\nFIRM. BUT WE HAVE TO ADD THIS, THAT\nAUTHORITIES BELIEVE THAT THIS SITUATION WOULD HAVE BEEN SO\nMUCH WORSE IF IT WASN'T FOR A HERO THAT WAS ON SITE.\nA POLICE OFFICER THAT THEY ARE IDENTIFYING AS JASON FALCONER\nFROM A NEARBY TOWN WHO WAS AT THE MALL WHO RESPONDED QUICKLY.\nACCORDING TO SURVEILLANCE VIDEO, OFFICIALS SAY AFTER WATCHING THE\nSURVEILLANCE VIDEO SAY HE REACTED VERY QUICKLY, EVEN WHEN\nTHE ATTACKER WAS LUNGING AT HIM. HE WENT AHEAD AND TOOK OUT HIS\nWEAPON, FIRED A SHOT AND KILLED THE SUSPECT.\nCAROL? >> ALL RIGHT, ROSA FLORES\nREPORTING LIVE FROM ST. CLOUD, MINNESOTA, THIS MORNING.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH. I WANT TO BRING BACK IN MY\nPANEL, WITH ME KAREN GREENBERG, DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER OF\nNATIONAL SECURITY AT FORDHAM UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL AND A\nTERRORIST ANALYST. A LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINER AND\nFORMER NYPD SERGEANT. WELCOME BACK.\nSO, KAREN, I WANT TO START WITH YOU AND THIS YOUNG MAN IN\nMINNESOTA. WE DON'T KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT\nHIM, BUT THE SOMALI COMMUNITY IN MINNESOTA KNOWS OF THE FAMILY,\nTHE FAMILY IS WELL-KNOWN. >> YEAH.\nI MEAN, THIS IS THE FIRST ATTACK IN THE UNITED STATES THAT A\nSOMALI-AMERICAN HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN.\nTHERE WAS A PLOT YEARS AGO BUT THIS IS THE FIRST ONE.\nSO I THINK THAT IS ALSO A THRESHHOLD.\nTHE SOMALI-AMERICAN COMMUNITY THAT HAS BEEN ATTRACTED TO ISIS\nHAS LARGELY WANTED TO GO ABROAD TO FIGHT EITHER WITH AL-SHABAAB\nOR IN SYRIA. BUT LET MEL THE YOU IN TERMS OF\nWHO THE INDIVIDUALS ARE COMPARED TO THE 110 CASES OF ISIS\nINDIVIDUALS IN THE UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW OVER THE PAST TWO\nYEARS. MOST OF THEM ARE 20, FOR THE\nMOST PART, WHEN APPREHENDED AND ARRESTED.\nBUT THOSE WHO CARRY OUT ATTACKS TEND TO BE OLDER LIKE THE\nINDIVIDUAL THEY ARE LOOKING FOR IN THE NEW YORK AREA RIGHT NOW.\nTHEY TEND TO BE IN THEIR LATE 20s.\nALSO, THE SAN BERNARDINO ATTACK, THE ORLANDO ATTACK, A NUMBER OF\nTHE SERIOUS THREATS TO NEW YORK CITY WERE FROM PEOPLE WHOSE\nBACKGROUND WAS IN AFGHANISTAN. SO THAT REALLY BRINGS IN THE\nLARGER PICTURE OF WHAT ACTUALLY ARE THE DISLOCATING ELEMENTS\nHERE. AND FINALLY, THERE IS OFTEN SOME\nPERSONAL TRAUMA THAT PROCEEDS THESE ATTACKS.\nWHO KNOWS WHAT IT WILL BE. WE HEAR THAT THE INDIVIDUAL\nTHERE IS LOOKING FOR AND WAS IN NEW JERSEY.\n>> THE THING IS WITH THE ATTACK IN MINNESOTA, ISIS CLAIMED\nRESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT. >> ISIS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY\nAFTER THEY HEARD THAT THE NAME OF THE PERSON WAS MUSLIM.\nWHO KNOWS WHAT MEANS FOR THE CALL TO RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT.\nWE DON'T KNOW. AND THEY MAY CLAIM\nRESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS. >> BUT THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY\nMEAN THAT THEY ORDERED IT FROM THESE OTHER COUNTRIES.\n>> OF COURSE NOT. WE HAVE NOT FOUND WITH THE\nEXCEPTION OF SOME INTERNET CASES THAT HAVE CALLED FOR THINGS OVER\nTHE INTERNET THAT HASN'T BEEN REALIZED.\nWE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT KIND OF CONNECTION AS I SEE BEFORE WITH\nAL QAEDA. WHAT IT MEANS TO BE INSPIRED BY\nISIS IN MORE WAYS IS UNSETTLING. IF YOU ARE REALLY FEELING THAT\nYOU'RE MISTREATED AND AREN'T AS SUCCESSFUL AS OTHER INDIVIDUALS,\nHERE'S WHAT YOU CAN DO ANYWHERE ANY TIME.\nBUT IS THAT A DIRECT MISSION OR DIRECT MESSAGE?\nI DON'T THINK SO. >> SO JOE, WE ARE SEPARATING OUT\nTHE MINNESOTA ATTACK BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT CONNECTING THAT TO\nTHE BOMBINGS HERE ON THE EAST COAST, RIGHT?\nSO WHY -- IS IT REALLY A TERROR CELL OR IS IT THESE GROUPS OF\nDISENFRANCHISED YOUNG MEN GETTING TOGETHER TO CAUSE\nTROUBLE? >> WELL, APPARENTLY IT SEEMS TO\nBE GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE HAD A HATRED FOR THE UNITED\nSTATES, A HATRED FOR OUR WAY OF LIFE, AND THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE\nIT TO US WITH THE BOMBS AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF DEVICES THEY\nARE GOING TO USE. I MEAN, WE USED A KNIFE IN THE\nMINNESOTA AREA, THE PRESSURE COOKERS HERE.\nNO GUNS INVOLVED IN THIS, WHICH IS UNUSUAL WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK\nAT IT, BUT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS A TOUGH JOB AHEAD OF IT.\nBECAUSE WE WANT TO GAIN THE VENLS BUT WE HAVE TO DO IT\nWITHIN THE BOUND RIS OF THE CONSTITUTION.\nAND THIS IS WHERE THAT WHOLE SHARE IS THAT WE HAVE A PROBLEM\nWITH. IT IS DIFFICULT TO INVOKE\nTERRORISM BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO I THINK FRINGE RIGHTS AND THAT IS\nWHAT THE PROBLEM IS. >> PUT THIS INTO PERSPECTIVE, IT\nCAUSES ONE TO FREAK OUT TO KNOW THERE WAS AN ATTACK IN\nMINNESOTA, RIGHT? THERE WAS AN ATTACK IN SEASIDE,\nNEW JERSEY. THERE WERE BOMBS FOUND IN\nELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY, AND THEN IN CHELSEA THE TWO PRESSURE\nCOOKER BOMBS. SO IS IT THIS WAVE OF TERRORISM\nROLLING OVER THE COUNTRY. LIKE PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE FOR\nME. IT'S THE WEEK OF 9/11.\nTHIS IS THE WEEK AFTER 9/11 THAT THE ATTACKS OCCURRED IN.\nIF THERE WAS A SENSE OF LET'S DO SOMETHING TO DESTABILIZE PEOPLE,\nTHAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD PICK. TO SEE A WAVE OF TERRORISM AS WE\nHAVE IN THE PAST WOULD BE WITH EXPANDING THAT.\nPEOPLE DID NOT DIE IN NEWS ATTACKS.\nTHE ABILITY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS TO CARRY OUT ATTACKS IN A\nSOPHISTICATED, EFFECTIVE, COORDINATED WAY HAS BEEN\nMINIMIZED. THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE LAW\nENFORCEMENT EFFORTS THAT HAVE VAST.\nAND IT'S ADEPT AT UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE THREAT IS.\nBUT IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF SIMILARITIES ISSUE.\nI THINK THAT IT IS MORPHING. THE MAY NOT BE USING THE WORD\nTERRORIST FOR THIS DOWN THE ROAD.\n>> I HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR STICKING\nAROUND. I DO APPRECIATE IT.\nTHANK YOU FOR JOINING ME. I'M CAROL COSTELLO.\nWE'LL BE BACK AFTER A BREAK.", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1474300148922.1474297357212.2f78d7ba-c263-47f9-a7f5-a699c719e051.segment2.thumb.jpg", "channel": "202"}], "channel": "202"}, {"videos": [{"start": 1097000, "length": 168234.0, "end": 1265234, "date": 1474219197080, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1474222367034.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1474218950450-644922d2-cda2-4377-98ca-400ba78371f5-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=1097.00,1265.23", "text": ">> YES, MA'AM.\n>>> BUSY SUNDAY, WE ARE AWAITING A NEWS CONFERENCE IN ST.

POLICE AND THE FBI APPARENTLY\nMADE A TRAFFIC STOP SUNDAY NIGHT, A SHORT TIME AGO AND\nTHEIR INVESTIGATION OF THIS WEEKEND'S BOMBING ATTACK IN\nMANHATTAN. FIVE PEOPLE WERE PULLED OVER BUT\nAS OF NOW, WE'RE TOLD NO ARRESTS HAVE BEEN MADE.\nNO CHARGES FILED. 29 PEOPLE WERE INJURED IN\nSATURDAY'S EXPLOSION AS A RESULT NEW YORK'S GOVERNOR IS ADDING\n1,000 MORE POLICE AND TROOPS TO PATROL BUS TERMINALS, AIRPORTS\nAND SUBWAY STATIONS. BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL SOMEBODY\nOUT THERE AND PLACE THESE EXPLOSIONS AND THEY DON'T HAVE\nTHEM YET. OUR CNN INVESTIGATIVE PRODUCER\nHAS BEEN WORKING THE SCENE NOW EVER SINCE THE STORY BROKE AND\nYOU'RE STILL TALKING WITH SOURCES.\nWHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THIS TRAFFIC STOP AND WHAT PERHAPS\nWERE THEIR SUSPICIONS? >> WE FIRST LEARNED OF THIS\nMAYBE AROUND AN HOUR OR SO AGO. A LOCAL STATE SENATOR HAD\nTWEETED THAT SOME -- ABOUT FIVE PEOPLE WERE QUESTIONED BY THE\nFBI. THEY WERE TAKEN INTO CUSTODY AND\nTHE FBI, THE ONLY THING THAT WE'RE CONFIRMING AT THIS HOUR IS\nTHAT THEY DID, IN FACT, STOP A CAR.\nTHEY WANTED TO QUESTION, THEY DID PULL THEM OVER AND THEY DID\nQUESTION THEM. WE BELIEVE THEY HAVE BEEN TAKEN\nBACK TO THE FBI OFFICES AND THE FBI STRESSED TO US THAT YES\nWHILE IT IS RELATED TO THE EXPLOSION THAT OCCURRED HERE IN\nMANHATTAN THE MEN HAVE NOT BEEN CHARGED AND NO ONE HAS BEEN\nARRESTED. >> WHILE YOU WERE TALKING WE\nWERE SHOWING VIDEO OF POLICE SURROUNDING A CAR THAT HAD BEEN\nROPED OFF WITH POLICE TAPE. THAT'S NOT THE CAR THEY PULLED\nOVER, RIGHT? THEY'RE INVESTIGATING A CAR THEY\nFOUND PARKED SOMEWHERE IN MANHATTAN.\n>> YEAH. SO ALL DAY LONG THERE'S BEEN\nDIFFERENT CARS THEY HAVE INVESTIGATED.\nSOME OF THE CARS JUST HAPPENED TO BE HIT BY SHRAPNEL.\nAND WE DO NOT HAVE ANY INDICATION BY LAW ENFORCEMENT\nTHAT THE PEOPLE OR THE PERSON BEHIND THE EXPLOSION WAS DRIVING\nA CAR. SO WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE\nRELATIONSHIP IS TO THE CAR AND THE CRIME SCENE.\nAND THEY FELT LIKE THEY NEEDED TO TAKE IT BACK TO EXAMINE IT\nFURTHER BUT BESIDES THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY FURTHER\nINFORMATION. >> DO WE KNOW IF THERE'S STILL\nROADS SHUTDOWN IN THIS AREA? CLOSED OFF?\nWE'RE ABOUT TO HIT A MONDAY HORNG IN NEW YORK CITY.\n>> I THINK WE EXPECT ALL THE ROADS TO BE OPEN BY TOMORROW\nMORNING OR BY THE MORNING I SHOULD SAY.\nTRAFFIC IS SLOWLY BEING REOPENED AND LIFE IS, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE\nTRYING TO SORT OF RESTORE LIFE BACK IN THIS COMMUNITY AND LET\nPEOPLE GET BACK INTO THEIR HOMES AND LIVE THEIR LIVES.\nSORT OF I GUESS RESTORE SOME KIND OF NORMALCY BUT EVERYTHING\nSHOULD BE REOPENED BY TOMORROW. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT LAW\nENFORCEMENT IS GOING TO LEAVE THE AREA.\nTHEY'RE STILL TALKING TO THEM INSIDE THE BUILDING.\nI THINK LAW ENFORCEMENT IS GOING TO REMAIN THERE BUT IT'S A\nQUESTION OF HOW MUCH LONGER BUT I THINK THE STREETS WILL ALL BE\nREOPENED BY TOMORROW. >> ONE OF OUR EXPERTS SAID\nPERHAPS THEY'RE NOT RELEASING THIS VIDEO BECAUSE THEY HAVE\nENOUGH TO GO ON RIGHT NOW. WE HOPE THAT'S THE CASE BECAUSE\nEVEN THOUGH NEW YORKERS GET BACK IN THERE THERE CERTAINLY HAS TO\nBE TENSION OR WORRY THAT WHOEVER DID THIS HAS NOT BEEN INVOLVED\nAT THIS POINT.

ON THE U.S. EAST\nCOAST. WE CONTINUE FOLLOWING THE\nBREAKING NEWS FROM SATURDAY NIGHT'S BOMBING IN NEW YORK.\nTHE FBI AND NEW YORK POLICE MADE A TRAFFIC STOP SUNDAY NIGHT IN\nTHIS INVESTIGATION. AND WE'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT\nANOTHER SITUATION PLAYING OUT RIGHT NOW IN NEW JERSEY.\nLET'S GO LIVE TO OUR CNN CORRESPONDENT DEBORAH FEYERICK\nFOLLOWING DEVELOPMENTS IN NEW YORK.\nDEBORAH, IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.\nWHAT MORE HAVE YOU LEARNED. >> THERE ARE A COUPLE OF\nINCIDENTS HAPPENING ACROSS BOTH MANHATTAN AND NEW JERSEY.\nWE'RE TOLD NOW THAT THE MAYOR OF ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY TWEETED\nTHAT FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS ARE ON SCENE OF A\nSUSPICIOUS PACKAGE AT A TRAIN STATION IN ELIZABETH, NEW\nJERSEY. RIGHT NOW THEY'RE SAYING THERE\nIS NO THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY AS THE PACKAGE IS SECURED AND ALSO\nINVESTIGATED. ANOTHER INCIDENT ALSO HAPPENING\nNEAR THE NORTHEAST CORRIDOR AND NORTH JERSEY COASTLINE RAIL\nSERVICE. THAT HAS BEEN SUSPENDED BETWEEN\nNEW YORK AND LIBERTY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT AND\nELIZABETH STATIONS BECAUSE POLICE ACTIVITY IN THE ELIZABETH\nAREA. WHENEVER YOU HAVE INCIDENTS LIKE\nWHAT HAPPENED IN NEW YORK CITY AND ALSO IN NEW JERSEY,\nOBVIOUSLY EVERYBODY GETS ON THE HEIGHTENED STATE OF ALERT.\nSO THEY TAKE ALL CALLS SERIOUSLY.\nTHE ISSUE THAT HAPPENED EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON AT A BRIDGE\nCONNECTING STATEN ISLAND AND NEW YORK, THAT THE FBI PUT OUT A\nSTATEMENT SAYING IT WAS CONNECTED TO WHAT HAPPENED IN\nMANHATTAN. BUT THE OTHERS SEEM TO BE\nSEPARATE THERE IS NOTHING LINKING THEM TO ANY OF THE\nINCIDENTS THAT HAPPENED. BUT IT'S ALL VERY EARLY.\nTHIS IS ALL PART OF A LARGER INVESTIGATION.\nAND SO YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF AUTHORITIES PAYING VERY CLOSE\nATTENTION TO ANY POTENTIAL CALL THAT IS MADE.\nBUT THEY'RE ALSO DOING A LOT OF INVESTIGATIVE WORK.\nAND SOME OF THIS INVESTIGATIVE WORK MAY BE LEADING TO TIPS THAT\nARE CAUSING THEM TO TAKE ACTION AND LOOK MORE CLOSELY AT WHAT\nWOULD ORDINARILY BE FOR EXAMPLE NORMAL VEHICLES.\n>> JUST LIKE WHAT WE SAW. JUST 24 HOURS AGO WHEN WE WERE\nCOVERING THE EXPLOSION AND THEN THE PRESSURE COOKER THAT WAS\nDISCOVERED. AND THEN INVESTIGATORS THOUGHT\nTHAT THERE WAS A THIRD DEVICE, THAT'S JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE ON\nTHAT HEIGHTENED ALERT, SWEEPING THE STREETS OF LOWER MANHATTAN.\nBUT IT TURNED OUT TO BE JUST GARBAGE.\nBUT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR EVERYTHING AS YOU RIGHTLY POINT\nOUT. WHAT ELSE CAN YOU TELL US ALSO,\nDEB, ABOUT THIS TRAFFIC STOP THAT INVESTIGATORS HAVE MADE?\n>> WELL, WHAT WE CAN TELL YOU IS THAT THIS TRAFFIC STOP, IT\nHAPPENED AT ABOUT 8:45 THIS EVENING.\nTHE FBI AND NYPD CONDUCTED WHAT THEY CALL A STOP OF A VEHICLE OF\nINTEREST TO THE INVESTIGATION INTO SATURDAY'S BOMBING IN\nMANHATTAN. BUT THEY'RE NOT TELLING --\nTHEY'RE NOT GIVING ANY OTHER SPECIFICS.\nTHERE IS NO INDICATION, FOR EXAMPLE.\nAND THERE IS REASON FOR THIS. THE HEAD OF THE FBI HERE IN NEW\nYORK SAID THEY'RE REALLY FOCUSED ON OPERATIONAL SECURITY.\nTHEY'RE MAKING SURE THAT NOTHING LEAKS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY\nCOMPROMISE THIS INVESTIGATION. IN ANY SERIOUS WAY.\nTHERE HAS ALREADY BEEN SOME INFORMATION THAT HAS BEEN\nRELEASED THAT IS A CAUSE OF CONCERN OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE THERE\nARE PEOPLE WHO ARE AT LARGE. THERE IS CERTAINLY ONE PERSON\nWHO IS AT LARGE, POSSIBLY MORE. AND YOU NEVER WANT TO GIVE\nANYONE THE HEADS UP AS TO WHAT IT IS INVESTIGATORS ARE\nDISCOVERING. BUT THEY DID RELEASE A PICTURE\nOF THAT PRESSURE COOKER. ON THAT PRESSURE COOKER THERE\nWAS A CELL PHONE. SO OBVIOUSLY IF YOU'VE GOT A\nCELL PHONE, YOU WANT TO SEE IF ANYBODY CALLED THAT CELL PHONE,\nPOSSIBLY, TO DETONATE THE DEVICE.\nAND IF SO, OFFICIALS CAN TRIANGULATE ONE PHONE TO THE\nOTHER AND GET SOME GOOD INFORMATION, SOME GOOD\nINTELLIGENCE. AGAIN, EVERYTHING IS BEING\nLOOKED AT. BUT THEY'RE REALLY TRYING TO BE\nVERY CAREFUL. YOU CAN SEE THE DEVICE THERE.\nTHAT'S THE ONE THAT DID NOT EXPLODE.\nAND GEORGE, LET ME TELL YOU, THE NYPD BOMB SQUAD, THEY WERE ABLE\nTO RENDER THAT SAFE THIS AFTERNOON.\nSO NOW THAT IS IN QUANTICO. IT'S GOING TO BE ANALYZED VERY,\nVERY CLOSELY. BECAUSE THERE MIGHT BE SOME SORT\nOF DNA ON THAT DEVICE. MAYBE A FINGERPRINT.\nIT MAY BE A HAIR. IT MAY BE SOMETHING THAT WILL\nGIVE INFORMATION AS TO WHO MADE THAT DEVICE.\nAND IF THAT PERSON IS IN A SYSTEM, SOME SORT OF A\nGOVERNMENT DATABASE, THAT CAN BE VERY HELPFUL INFORMATION.\nBUT THEY'RE LOOKING AT IT VERY CLOSELY.\n>> DEB, AND YOU SET ME UP FOR THE NEXT THING.\nI WANT TO TALK TO OUR GUEST ABOUT IT.\nBUT THE SIMPLE FACT THAT WHEN PEOPLE SET THESE DEVICES OUT,\nYOU KNOW, A LOT OF TIMES THEY'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT\nYES, FINGERPRINTS ARE LEFT OVER, ESPECIALLY IF THAT DEVICE\nDOESN'T DETONATE. DEBORAH FEYERICK LIVE FOR US IN\nNEW YORK, WE'LL STAY IN TOUCH WITH US THROUGH THE NIGHT AS YOU\nCONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE WORK OF THESE INVESTIGATORS.\nLET'S NOW BRING IN OUR STEVE MOORE, CONTRIBUTING WITH US.\nLAW ENFORCEMENT CONTRIBUTOR. HE IS A RETIRED SUPERVISORY\nSPECIAL AGENT WITH THE FBI LIVE VIA SKYPE IN LOS ANGELES.\nI WANT TO TALK THAN. AND I HEARD YOU SPEAKING WITH MY\nCOLLEAGUE NATALIE ALLEN EARLIER ABOUT IT.\nBUT THE SIMPLE FACT THAT THEY HAVE THIS DEVICE THAT DID NOT\nDETONATE. AND NOW INVESTIGATORS WILL BE\nABLE TO GLEAN SOME INFORMATION FROM IT, STEVE.\n>> YES, THEY WILL. WHEN YOU'RE PUTTING A BOMB TO OR\nAN IED TOGETHER, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SPEND A LOT OF PRIME\nMINISTER WORRYING WHETHER YOU LEAVE FINGERPRINTS ON IT, OR\nWHETHER YOU HAVE TOUCHED THE PHONE THAT YOU'RE TAPING TO THE\nDEVICE BECAUSE YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO BE BLOWN INTO\nITTY-BITTY LITTLE PIECES. AND WHEN IT'S NOT, THAT\nINFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE TO THE FBI AND NEW YORK JOINT\nTERRORISM TASK FORCE. THE OTHER THING IS IT'S GOT A\nCELL PHONE ON IT. AND IF THAT CELL PHONE WAS ON\nAND PART OF THE SYSTEM, MEANING THAT IT WAS PINGING CELLS, YOU\nCOULD TRACK IT BACK FOR TWO WEEKS AND FIND OUT WHERE IT\nSPENDS ITS NIGHTS. SO THAT CELL PHONE IS A GOLD\nMINE. >> ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE\nFACT THAT -- AND AGAIN, THIS IS UNRELATED.\nBUT THESE OFFICERS, THESE INVESTIGATORS HAVE FOUND A\nSITUATION IN NEW JERSEY THAT THEY'RE LOOKING INTO.\nWHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT? WE UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'RE\nLOOKING FOR EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW.\nTHIS HEIGHTENED SENSE OF ALERT. >> WELL, WE WON'T KNOW OBVIOUSLY\nFOR A LITTLE WHILE, GEORGE. AND YOU'RE RIGHT TO ASK THE\nQUESTION. IT COULD BE JUST AN ABUNDANCE OF\nCAUTION. THIS LOOKS SUSPICIOUS.\nAND WE SHOULD BE CHECKING THESE THINGS OUT.\nBUT I DON'T KNOW RIGHT NOW WHETHER I WOULD PUT MUCH\nCREDENCE IN IT. I THINK THIS GROUP WANTED TO\nATTACK NEW YORK. IT'S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE.\nI MEAN, THEY HIT NEW JERSEY, I BELIEVE, BEFORE THE MARINE CORPS\nCHARITY RUN. SO IT COULD BE SOMETHING.\nI WOULDN'T PUT A LOT OF STOCK IN IT RIGHT NOW.\n>> I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS TRAFFIC STOP.\nPOINTING OUT TO VIEWERS NO ONE HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH ANYTHING.\nBUT THIS TRAFFIC STOP THAT HAS BEEN MADE IN CONNECTION WITH\nWHAT HAPPENED IN NEW YORK. OBVIOUSLY, AS YOU POINTED OUT.\nINVESTIGATORS CAN DETERMINE FINGERPRINT INFORMATION FROM,\nYOU KNOW, THINGS THAT DIDN'T DETONATE, THINGS THAT WERE LEFT\nOVER. SO TELL US WHERE WE ARE WITH\nTHAT. >> WELL, THE FBI DOESN'T PATROL.\nTHE JOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCE ISN'T OUT LOOKING FOR PEOPLE\nRANDOMLY. THAT WAS A TARGETED TRAFFIC\nSTOP. AND THE FACT THAT THEY DID IT ON\nA BRIDGE IS INTERESTING TO ME. THAT LOWERS THE RISK OF ANYBODY\nGETTING OUT AND RUNNING BECAUSE THERE IS NOT VERY FAR TO RUN.\nSO I THINK IT WAS CALCULATED. I THINK THE STOP ON THE BRIDGE\nWAS CALCULATED. BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO\nTHAT BECAUSE IT'S -- UNLESS YOU HAVE TO BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO\nJAM TRAFFIC UP. AND THAT'S NOT A GOOD THING.\nTHE FACT THAT THEY -- THE PEOPLE IN THE CAR, THERE WERE FIVE IN\nTHE CAR. THAT'S INTERESTING.\nAND NOW THEY'RE ALL AT FBI HEADQUARTERS.\nTHAT'S INTERESTING TOO. THEY MAY NOT BE UNDER ARREST.\nTHEY MAY NOT EVEN BE UNDER INVESTIGATIVE DETENTION.\nBUT THEY ARE BEING QUESTIONED. >> I WANT YOU TO HELP ME TO\nSQUARE THE CIRCLE. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ASKING THIS\nQUESTION THERE IS CONFUSION ABOUT THE SIMPLE WORD TERRORISM.\nWE KNOW THE GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK HAS COME OUT TO SAY THAT THIS IS\nTERRORISM. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THE MAYOR\nHAS INDICATED THAT THERE IS NO NEXUS TO INTERNATIONAL\nTERRORISM. AT THE SAME TIME THE CITY, NOT\nLOOKING AT THIS AS TERRORISM. >> THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION,\nGEORGE. AND I BELIEVE THE FACT THAT THE\nJOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCE IS STILL WORKING ON IT.\nPROBABLY INDICATE WHERE THIS IS GOING TO GO.\nHOWEVER, YOU'RE CORRECT. THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT KINDS\nOF TERRORISM. YOU COULD HAVE A DOMESTIC\nTERRORIST. YOU COULD HAVE SOMEBODY WHO IS A\nWHITE SUPREMACIST. YOU COULD HAVE SOME INDEPENDENCE\nGROUP FROM PUERTO RICO. I MEAN, I'M NOT SAYING THAT\nTHAT'S LIKELY. BUT THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT\nTYPES OF TERRORISM. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO MEAN ISLAMIC\nTERRORISM. ISIS, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.\n>> STEVE MOORE LIVE FOR US IN LOS ANGELES.\nSTEVE, WE APPRECIATE YOUR INSIGHT.\nWE'LL STAY IN TOUCH WITH YOU. I'M SURE PLENTY OF QUESTIONS\nAHEAD AS WE SEAL TO BE STARTING A BUSY NIGHT WITH INVESTIGATORS\nON THE JOB.", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1474266765910.1474262274270.ee184600-0c27-4d7a-b453-e88a2d8d016c.segment9.thumb.jpg", "channel": "202"}, {"start": 1691125.0, "length": 68482.0, "end": 1759607, "date": 1474262461469, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1474262274270.ee184600-0c27-4d7a-b453-e88a2d8d016c.mp4#t=1691.12,1759.61", "text": ">>> WELCOME BACK TO CNN.\nFOLLOWING THE BREAKING NEWS HERE THIS HOUR, FIRST IN THE BOMBING\nSITUATION IN NEW YORK, THE INVESTIGATION THERE.\nTHE FBI SAYS THAT AGENTS AND POLICE MADE A TRAFFIC STOP ON\nSUNDAY NIGHT IN RELATION TO THAT SATURDAY ATTACK.\nWE'RE TOLD THAT FIVE PEOPLE WERE STOPPED.\nNO ONE, THOUGH, HAS BEEN ARRESTED OR CHARGED WITH\nANYTHING AS OF YET.

THEY LOOKED INSIDE THAT BACKPACK\nTHINKING THEY WERE GOING TO FIND SOMETHING PERHAPS VALUABLE.\nTHAT'S WHEN THEY SAW SOMETHING SUSPICIOUS.\nWHAT HE DESCRIBED AS MULTIPLE DEVICES.\nTHEY THEN DROPPED THE BACKPACK, WENT AROUND THE CORNER TO A\nNEARBY POLICE STATION WHERE THEY NOTIFIED THE AUTHORITIES OF WHAT\nTHEY HAD FOUND. THAT'S WHEN THE POLICE WENT TO\nTHE BACKPACK, AGREED THERE WAS SOMETHING SUSPICIOUS IN THERE.\nAND NOW THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES RESPONDED AS WELL AS THE FBI.\nTHE MAYOR ALSO TOLD US THAT THEY WERE UP TO FIVE DEVICES FOUND IN\nTHAT BACKPACK. HE SAID THAT THERE WAS NO TIMER\nON THOSE DEVICES, NO CELL PHONE ON THOSE DEVICES.\nHE ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THIS IS THE PERFECT EXAMPLE OF IF YOU\nSEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING.

IT SEEMS TO BE CENTERED OUT OF\nELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY WHERE THE FBI HAS BEEN ALL MORNING\nCONDUCTING A SEARCH. >> THEY FOUND A LOT OF\nSIMILARITIES IN MATERIAL OF THESE BOMBS, DETONATION DEVICES.\nTHE CHECK ON THAT IS IT'S ALSO VERY COMMON TECHNOLOGY.\nBUT THE TIMING SEEMS TO BE MORE THAN A COINCIDENCE FOR THEM.\nWE KNOW THERE'S ALSO AN ACTIVE SEARCH GOING ON RIGHT NOW.\n>> THAT'S HAPPENING IN ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY.\nAUTHORITIES THERE, OF COURSE, ARE LOOKING AT THIS SECOND\nSCENE.

WE'VE SEEN FBI AGENTS HERE ALL\nMORNING GOING IN TO THIS FRIDAY CHICKEN RESTAURANT ALSO\nCONDUCTING THEIR INVESTIGATION IN THE HOME ABOVE IT.\nWE'VE ALSO SEEN ATF AGENTS HERE, WE'VE SEEN STATE POLICE.\nWE'RE ALSO HEARING SEVERAL REPORTS THAT THIS IS THE LAST\nKNOWN ADDRESS OF AHMAD. WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM\nTHAT. BUT THAT'S WHAT MULTIPLE\nSOURCES, MULTIPLE REPORTS ARE SAYING.\nTHIS MORNING WE HAVE ALSO BEEN SEEING THAT THE PERIMETER, THE\nSECURED PERIMETER IS BEING WIDENED AROUND HERE.\nOF COURSE THE DAY IS STARTING, RESIDENTS ARE COMING ON TO THE\nSTREET WONDERING WHAT IS HAPPENING.\nEVERYBODY HAS MANY QUESTIONS. CHRIS?\n>> ALL RIGHT, RAMPLE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nLET US KNOW WHAT YOU FIGURE OUT FROM THE SCENE.\nTHERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPERATIONS GOING ON WITH THIS\nINVESTIGATION RIGHT NOW.

HE IS ON THE RUN.\nAUTHORITIES DO NOT KNOW WHERE HE IS.\nTHEY ARE ASKING FOR YOUR HELP. NOW ANOTHER PIECE OF THIS PLACE\nWAS THAT THIS INVESTIGATION IS THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER BOMB NEAR\nA TRAIN STATION IN ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY.\nSO FOR THAT PART LET'S GET TO CNN'S JEAN CASAREZ LIVE AT THE\nSCENE WITH THE LATEST. THEY BROUGHT IN THE ROBOT TO TRY\nAND KEEL WITH IT. WHAT DO WE KNOW?\n>> WHAT WE KNOW IS THIS IS AN ACTIVE SITUATION RIGHT NOW.\nIT'S A CRIME SCENE. A CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION IS\nGOING ON. THEY SAY IF YOU SEE SOMETHING,\nSAY SOMETHING. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT LAST\nNIGHT AT 9:30, 2 MEN WAUKD BY A TRASH CAN HERE IN ELIZABETH NEW\nJERSEY NEXT TO A PUB NEAR THE TRAIN STATION.\nTHEY SAW A BACK PACK. THEY THOUGHT THERE MIGHT BE\nSOMETHING IN IT. SO THEY GOT IT, THEY TOOK IT\nUNDER THE TRAIN TRACKS, THEY OEPD IT UP AND THEY SAW A PIPE\nAND THEY SAW WIERS. THEY THEN WENT TO LOCAL\nAUTHORITIES AND SAID WE THINK WE'VE GOT SOMETHING SERIOUS HERE\nAND WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT RIGHT THERE IS WHEN THAT ROBOT\nWENT IN TO ACTUALLY RECTIFY THE SITUATION.\nIT ACCIDENTALLY DETONATED ONE OF THE BOMBS IN THERE.\nAND WE ARE HEARING THAT THERE WERE FOUR BOMBS IN THERE.\nAT LEAST FOUR. MULTIPLE DEVICES.\nSO AT THAT POINT THE FBI IS CALLED IN AND ALL SOURCES.\nTHEY NOW HAVE IT IN A SAFE CONTAINER.\nTHEY WILL BE SHIPPING IT TO QUANTICO, VIRGINIA, FOR ALL\nFORENSIC EVIDENCE. BUT THEY ALSO, WE UNDERSTAND,\nFOUND SOME SURVEILLANCE VIDEO FROM THAT PUB AND OVERNIGHT\nTHEY'VE BEEN GOING OVER THAT VIDEO TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY\nIDENTITIES OF SOMEONE WHO WOULD HAVE TAKEN THAT BACK PACK AND\nPUT IT IN THAT TRASH CAN. CHRIS?\n>> ALL RIGHT JEAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nLET US KNOW WHAT YOU LEARN AS YOU LEARN IT.\nNOW TO MINNESOTA. THERE WAS ANOTHER ATTACK THERE.\nDIDN'T INVOLVE AN EXPLOSIVE, AND THE AUTHORITIES KNOW WHO DID IT.\nTHEY IDENTIFIED THE SUSPECT IN THIS WEEKEND'S STABBING SPREE AT\nA MINNESOTA SHOPPING MALL, AN ISIS LINKED NEWS AGENCY IS\nTAKING RESPONSIBILITY, PRAISING THE ATTACKER AS A QUOTE SOLDIER\nOF THE ISLAMIC STATE.

WE ALSO KNOW THAT THEY HAD\nRAIDED FOR SEARCHED THE HOME IN ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY OVERNIGHT.\nTHIS SEEMS TO BE CENTERED AROUND ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY RIGHT NOW.\nTHE REASON THEY'RE LOOKING FOR THIS INDIVIDUAL IS BECAUSE THEY\nBELIEVE, NOW THEY'RE CAUTIONING US, THEY BELIEVE HE IS THE MAN\nON THE VIDEO THAT WE HAVE BEEN DESCRIBING SINCE YESTERDAY IN\nCHELSEA, SEEN AROUND THE AREA WHERE THE EXPLOSION OCCURS, AND\nALSO SEEN AGAIN ON 27th STREET WITH THIS DUFFEL BAG WHERE THEY\nEVENTUALLY FOUND THE PRESSURE COOKER.\n>> WE HAVE BEEN WONDERING WHAT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS GUY IS.\nTHAT WOULD MAKE SENSE IF HE WAS THE ONE ON THE SURVEILLANCE\nVIDEO. ISIS NOT CLAIMING\nRESPONSIBILITY. HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THAT TO YOU?\n>> DEAFENING SILENCE FROM ISIS ON THIS ONE.\nSO FAR. AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE\nSUSPECT, HE WAS BORN IN AFGHANISTAN, CAME TO THE UNITED\nSTATES. IF THERE IS, INDEED, A OVERSEAS\nTERROR CONNECTION WE DO NOT KNOW THAT AT THIS POINT BOUGHT\nGOVERNOR CUOMO AT LEAST RAISED THE POSSIBILITY THIS MORNING.\nINVESTIGATORS WILL LOOK AT GROUPS LIKE THE PAKISTAN TALIBAN\nLIKE AL QAEDA. THE PAKISTANI TALIBAN WERE A\nGROUP THAT DIRECTED THE TIMES SQUARE ATTACK ATTEMPTED ATTACK\nIN MAY OF 2010. THIS MAY HAVE -- THIS MAY HAVE\nNO ISIS CONNECTION WHATSOEVER. BUT YET WE'VE YET TO HEAR ANY\nCLAIM FROM ANY OVERSEAS GROUP. AND INVESTIGATORS DON'T KNOW IF\nTHIS HAS A FOREIGN CONNECTION YET.\n>> FAISAL SHAZ ADD WAS A BIG WAKE-UP CALL.\nHE HAD A LEGITIMATE LIFE HERE AND TO THE SURPRISE OF EVERYBODY\nIN THAT MAN'S LIFE, INCLUDING HIS OWN FAMILY, HE WAS JUST\nWAITING TO BE ACTIVATED ALL ALONG.\nTOM FUENTES THAT TAX US TO THE CONCERN ABOUT HOW DOES IT GROW\nOUT FROM THIS MAN, THERE WAS REPORTING EARLY ON FROM\nAUTHORITIES WHEN THEY STOPPED THAT CAR ON THE VERRAZANO,\nTHERE'S A GROUP, THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A CELL IN ELIZABETH, NEW\nJERSEY. HOW DO THEY LOOK AT THAT TYPE OF\nINVESTIGATION? >> WELL IN THE FIRST PLACE,\nCHRIS, THEY'LL BE LOOKING AT WHATEVER COMMUNICATION DEVICES\nHE HAD. SO HIS CELL -- OR HAS, STILL\nHAS, CELL PHONES THAT HE MAY HAVE USED.\nIF THEY BELIEVE THAT THE DUMPSTER BOMB ON 23rd STREET,\nTHE FIRST BOMB EXPLODED IN NEW YORK, WAS DETONATED BY A CELL\nPHONE CALL, THEN THAT A CELL PHONE WENT THROUGH THE CHELSEA\nPHONE TOWERS, AT THAT TIME WHEN THAT BOMB WAS DETONATED.\nTHERE MAY HAVE BEEN ANOTHER ATTEMPT USING THAT PHONE TO\nDETONATE THE SECOND DEVICE ON 27th STREET AND AGAIN THE TWO\nINDIVIDUALS THAT REMOVED THAT PRESSURE COOKER FROM THE DUFFEL\nBAG MAY HAVE DISTURBED THE WIRING WHICH MAY HAVE CAUSED IT\nTO NOT DETONATE. THAT MAY HAVE BEEN DISABLED\nACCIDENTALLY BY THOSE GUYS. AND THAT'S WHY IT DIDN'T\nDETONATE. BUT THEY WOULD HAVE CELL PHONE\nCONNECTIONS TRYING TO DETONATE IT.\nSO THAT'S ONE ASPECT OF IT. AND THEN LOOKING AT DOES HE HAVE\nSOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS? WHO WAS HE IN COMMUNICATION WITH\nAND HOW? OR IS HE USING DARK APPS WHICH\nTHE FBI IS NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO PENETRATE AND IT'S MUCH MORE\nDIFFICULT FOR THE INVESTIGATION. THEN YOU'VE GOT ALL OF THE VIDEO\nCAMERAS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT AS SHIMON MENTIONED THAT HAVE\nHELPED IDENTIFY HIM AS CARRYING THE DUFFEL BAG OR DRAGGING THE\nROLLING DUFFEL BAG AROUND. BUT YOU ALSO HAVE ALL OF THE\nSTREET CAMERAS, THE TOLL BRIDGE AND TUNNEL CAM RAS THAT WOULD\nSHOW THE VEHICLES COMING AND GOING FROM NEW JERSEY AND\nPOSSIBLY FROM ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY.\nSO THEY'D BE TRYING TO PIECE TOGETHER ALL OF THE HIGHWAY\nVIDEO THAT'S AVAILABLE TO THE POLICE AND TO THE FBI, SHOWING\nTHE MOVEMENT OF IN PARTICULAR THAT SUBARU VEHICLE OR OTHER\nVEHICLES THAT MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH HIM.\n>> RIGHT. THAT BRINGS US TO THE TRAFFIC\nSTOP THAT WAS MADE NEAR THE VERRAZANO BRIDGE.\nDO WE KNOW AND THERE WERE I THINK FIVE PEOPLE QUESTIONED.\n>> YES. >> DO WE KNOW WHAT THAT GUY IN\nTHE WANTED POSTER'S CONNECTION IS TO THOSE PEOPLE?\n>> NO WE DON'T. BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT\nWE'VE BEEN TOLD BY AUTHORITIES THAT THEY MAY BE FROM THE\nELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY AREA. AGAIN, EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW\nSEEMS TO BE CENTERED AROUND ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY WHERE THE\nFBI IS CONDUCTING ITS SEARCH. PERHAPS MAYBE THIS GUY LIVED\nTHERE OR THEY THOUGHT HE WAS THERE AND THEY WENT IN AND HE\nWASN'T THERE SO THIS NOW HAS STARTED THIS MANHUNT.\n>> THIS IS THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL ATTACK IN NEW YORK CITY SINCE\nSEPTEMBER 11th.

THEY BELIEVE HE'S ON THAT VIDEO.\nTHIS IS WHY THEY WANT TO QUESTION HIM.\nSO NOW AUTHORITIES ARE OUT SEARCHING FOR HIM.\nTHERE WAS SOME INDICATION THAT AUTHORITIES KNEW WHERE HE WAS OR\nAT LEAST HAD SOME IDEA OF WHERE HE WAS.\nBECAUSE THEY'RE NOT JUST LEARNING HIS NAME THIS MORNING.\nTHEY'VE HAD HIS NAME FOR QUITE SOME TIME.\nBUT THERE'S PROBABLY A REASON WHY WE'RE JUST LEARNING OF IT\nTHIS MORNING. PERHAPS THEIR LEADS HAVE DRIED\nUP AND SO NOW THEY'RE OUT SEARCHING AND CONTINUING TO\nSEARCH AND THEY HAVE NOT FOUND HIM SO NOW THEY'RE ASKING THE\nPUBLIC FOR THEIR HELP. >> HE'S A NATURALIZED AMERICAN\nCITIZEN. WE DON'T -- HE WAS BORN IN\nAFGHANISTAN. >> YES.\n>> WE DON'T KNOW WHEN HE CAME INTO THE UNITED STATES.\n>> WE STILL DON'T KNOW. THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE TRYING TO\nFIGURE OUT. WE'VE NOT BEEN TOLD WHEN HE CAME\nHERE. CERTAINLY THERE'S A HUGE, HUGE\nMANHUNT RIGHT NOW UNDER WAY FOR HIM AROUND NEW YORK CITY REALLY.\n>> THEY'RE ASKING FOR THE PUBLIC'S HELP, TOO.\n>> YES. >> THAT'S WHY WE HAVE HIS WANTED\nPOSTER, THE FBI PUT OUT A POSTER AND WE'RE GOING TO BE SHOWING\nYOU A PHONE NUMBER THROUGHOUT THE MORNING.\nYOU CAN CALL THIS NUMBER. I'D LOVE FOR US TO PUT THE\nNUMBER UP RIGHT NOW. CALL THAT NUMBER THAT WE'RE\nABOUT TO SHOW YOU THERE IT IS, 1-800-577-TIPS.\nIF YOU'VE SEEN THIS MAN YOU KNOW THIS MAN PLEASE CALL IN TO THAT\nTIP LINE AND HELP POLICE TRACK HIM DOWN BECAUSE HE COULD\nPROVIDE VITAL INFORMATION INTO WHAT HAPPENED OVER THE WEEKEND.\nALL RIGHT. SO THE SEARCH FOR THIS MAN COMES\nAS -- COMES AS POLICE SURVEILLANCE VIDEO SHOWS THE\nSAME PERSON WAS SEEN AT BOTH CHELSEA LOCATIONS ON SATURDAY\nNIGHT. CNN'S JESSICA SCHNEIDER IS\nFOLLOWING THAT ANGLE FOR US. WHAT ARE YOU LEARNING?\n>> WELL, CAROL, WE KNEW THAT VIDEO SURVEILLANCE WOULD BE KEY\nTO THIS INVESTIGATION. POLICE COMMISSIONER JAMES\nO'NEILL SAID IT YESTERDAY, AND NOW IT TURNS OUT THAT TWO KEY\nPIECES OF VIDEO TAKEN RIGHT HERE IN THE CHELSEA NEIGHBORHOOD OF\nMANHATTAN HAVE LED THE POLICE AND THE FBI TO RELEASE THAT\nWANTED POSTER FOR 28-YEAR-OLD AHMAD KHAN RAHAMI.\nTHEY'RE NOW LOOKING FOR HIM AS YOU MENTIONED.\nNOW LET ME PIECE IT TOGETHER FOR YOU.\nINVESTIGATORS FOUND TWO PIECES OF VIDEO, ONE FROM RIGHT HERE AT\nWEST 23rd STREET WHERE THAT EXPLOSION HAPPENED SATURDAY\nNIGHT. THE OTHER FOUR BLOCKS NORTH AT\nWEST 27th. THEY SAY THE SAME MAN APPEARED\nIN BOTH LOCATIONS IN THAT SURVEILLANCE VIDEO, AND HE WAS\nSEEN WHEELING A DUFFEL BAG. NOW THE DUFFEL BAG WAS HERE AT\n23rd, ALSO AT 27th. THEY SAY THAT TWO OTHER MEN WERE\nALSO SEEN IN THE VIDEO AFTER THE FIRST MAN LEFT, GOING IN TO THE\nDUFFEL BAG, AND PULLING OUT A WHITE PLASTIC GARBAGE BAG THAT\nINVESTIGATORS BELIEVE CONTAINED THAT UNEXPLODED PRESSURE COOKER.\nNOW AUTHORITIES NOW BELIEVE THAT THE MAN SEEN IN BOTH LOCATIONS\nIS, IN FACT, 28-YEAR-OLD AHMAD CHAN RAHAMI.\nWE UNDERSTAND HE'S A U.S. NATURALIZED CITIZEN ORIGINALLY\nBORN IN AFGHANISTAN IN 1988. HIS LAST KNOWN ADDRESS WAS IN\nELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY WHERE ALL THAT ACTIVITY HAS TAKEN PLACE\nOVERNIGHT. THIS ALL SUGGESTING THAT NEXUS\nTO FOREIGN TERRORISM, AND NEW YORK GOVERNOR AN DREW CUOMO\nTALKED ABOUT THAT POSSIBILITY THIS MORNING ON \"NEW DAY.\"\nTAKE A LISTEN. >> I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF WE\nDO FIND A FOREIGN CONNECTION TO THE ACT.\nYESTERDAY WE WERE SAYING THAT IN PIE OPINION IT WAS CLEARLY AN\nACT OF TERRORISM. IT WAS A DANGEROUS ACT.\nIT APPEARED DESIGNED TO INTIMIDATE CIVILIAN POPULATION.\nYOU SET OFF TWO BOMBS IN NEW YORK CITY.\nNOT TO MENTION NEW JERSEY, AND THAT IS AN ACT OF TERRORISM.\nTHE QUESTION WAS WHETHER FOREIGN RELATED.\nI THINK THAT ANSWER MIGHT BE COMING TODAY.\n>> WHILE THAT SEARCH SPEEDS FORWARD THIS IS ALL STILL VERY\nACTIVE INVESTIGATION. WEST 23rd STREET STILL SHUT DOWN\nBEHIND ME. JUST MOMENTS AGO I SAW THE FBI\nEVIDENCE TEAM SEARCHING HERE ON THE STREET.\nSO THIS IS AN ACTIVE INVESTIGATION, AND NOW AN ACTIVE\nMANHUNT, AS WELL. CAROL?\n>> ALL RIGHT, JESSICA SCHNEIDER REPORTING LIVE FROM MANHATTAN\nAND CHELSEA THIS MORNING. LET'S BRING IN CNN'S JEAN\nCASAREZ IN ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY, WHERE POLICE ARE ON SITE\nIN UNION COUNTY SEARCHING THE AREA NEAR A TRAIN STATION WHERE\nBOMBS WERE PLACED IN THE TRASH CAN.\nTHEY FOUND THOSE BOMBS JUST AFTER MIDNIGHT.\nJEAN, WHAT CAN YOU TELL US? >> WE ARE RIGHT HERE IN\nELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY. THERE IS AN FBI SEARCH WARRANT\nCONTINUING TO BE EXECUTED HERE IN ELIZABETH AT A SECONDARY\nLOCATION. IT IS CLOSE TO WHERE THAT BACK\nPACK WAS FOUND LAST NIGHT ABOUT 9:30.\nLET ME TAKE YOU THERE. IT WAS 9:30 LAST NIGHT AND TWO\nMEN WERE WALKING BY. JUST A TRASH CAN 23450ER A PUB\nCLOSE TO THE TRAIN STATION. THEY SAW A BACK PACK.\nTHEY TOOK IT OUT. TOOK IT UNDER THE TRAIN RAILS\nWHERE THE TRAIN WAS TRAVELING. AND THEY OPENED IT.\nBELIEVING SOMETHING WAS IN IT. AND THEY SAW A PIPE AND WIRES.\nSO THEY LEFT. AND THEY WENT TO AUTHORITIES\nSAYING THIS IS SERIOUS. AND THAT'S WHERE THE BOMB SQUAD\nCAME IN. I THINK WHAT YOU JUST SAW RIGHT\nTHERE WAS AN EXPLOSION, BECAUSE WHEN A ROBOT WENT IN TO TRY TO\nRECTIFY THE SITUATION, IT ACTUALLY DETONATED ONE OF THE\nEXPLOSIVES. WE UNDERSTAND THERE WERE AT\nLEAST FOUR BOMBS IN THERE. AND ONE WENT OFF.\nSO THE OTHER FOUR HAVE BEEN CONTAINED NOW IN A VERY SOLID\nAND SAFE CONTAINER. IT, ALONG WITH THE FRAGMENTS\nFROM THE ONE THAT WAS EXPLODED, WILL BE SENT TO THE FBI TO\nQUANTICO, VIRGINIA, FOR TESTING. CAROL?\n>> ALL RIGHT, JEAN CASAREZ REPORTING LIVE FROM ELIZABETH,\nNEW JERSEY.

SO, IT'S EVEN SCARIER THAT ON A\nWARM, BUSY, BUSTLING SATURDAY NIGHT THAT THIS TYPE OF THREAT\nWOULD HAPPEN HERE IN THIS RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD.\n>> IT IS PUZZLING THAT THE SUSPECT PLACED THESE PRESSURE\nCOOKER BOMBS IN GARBAGE BINS, AND NOT LEFT THEM SOMEWHERE OUT\nON THE STREET OR IN A RESTAURANT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.\n>> WELL, I MEAN, I'M NOT OF COURSE A COUNTERTERRORISM EXPERT\nAND I KNOW YOU GUYS HAVE HAD PLENTY OF PEOPLE ON TALKING\nABOUT THIS.

THEY SAY RAHAMI WAS SEEN AT THE\nLOCATION RIGHT HERE AT WEST 23rd STREET WHERE THE EXPLOSION\nHAPPENED ON SATURDAY NIGHT AND JUST FOUR BLOCKS NORTH OF HERE\nON WEST 27th WHERE THAT PRESSURE COOKER WAS FOUND.\nTHEY SAY THAT THE VIDEOS SHOW RAHAMI WITH A BLACK DUFFEL BAG\nON WHEELS AT THIS LOCATION AND THEN ALSO AT THE WEST 27th\nSTREET LOCATION. THEY SAY THEY ALSO FOUND VIDEO\nEVIDENCE OF TWO OTHER MEN WHO WERE SOMEHOW ASSOCIATED WITH\nTHAT DUFFEL BAG.

I AM NOT SURPRISED THAT THEY ARE\nNOW IDENTIFYING A PERPETRATOR. WHETHER THAT PERPETRATOR IS THE\nSAME ONE THAT WAS HERE IN SEASIDE PARK, I DON'T KNOW.\nBUT ALL THE RESOURCES FROM THE LOCAL TO THE COUNTY TO STATE AND\nOF COURSE THE FEDERAL OFFICE ARE VERY SOPHISTICATED, VERY\nTHOROUGH IN THEIR INVESTIGATION. SO I'M NOT SURPRISED AT ALL.\n>> DOES IT SURPRISE YOU THAT SOURCES ARE TELLING US THAT THE\nSEASIDE PARK EXPLOSION IS NOW CONNECTED TO THE EXPLOSION IN\nCHELSEA? >> I DON'T KNOW THAT.\nI WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED, BUT IT COULD BE -- IT COULD BE A SINGLE\nEVENT. AND I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED\nABOUT THAT ALSO. RIGHT NOW I'M CONCERNED ABOUT\nSEASIDE PARK. AND MY NEIGHBORS AND\nCONSTITUENTS.

SO THAT IS WHY, THAT IS WHY YOU\nSTEP UP YOUR OBSERVATION, YOUR INDI\nINDIVIDUAL LENS AND SO ON. THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE THERE\nCOULD HAVE BEEN SOMETHING ELSE.

AS FAR AS TYING THEIR HANDS, I\nKNOW THERE ARE MANY, MANY POLICIES AND PRACTICES AND\nTHINGS THAT NEED TO BE OBSERVED. I UNDERSTAND THAT.\nBUT JUST LIKE IN ANY OTHER PROFESSION, THOSE ARE THE RULES\nOF THE ROAD. YOU MOVE FORWARD.\nYOU DO THE BEST JOB YOU POSSIBLY CAN.\n>> SOURCES ARE ALSO TELLING US THAT THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY\nTHAT IT IS SOME SORT OF TERRORIST CELL THAT MAY BE AT\nWORK HERE, NOT JUST LONE WOLVES, BUT A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE\nCOORDINATED IN THEIR EFFORTS. YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT.\n>> WE FOUND THAT AFTER 9/11 THAT THERE WERE THESE CELLS AROUND,\nAND I BELIEVE THAT SOME OF THEM WERE IN THE VICINITY OF SEASIDE\nPARK. AND IN OCEAN COUNTY.\nSO THESE ARE POSSIBLE. I MEAN, THESE ARE CERTAINLY\nPOSSIBLE. THE WORLD IS A MUCH SMALLER\nPLACE THAN IT EVER WAS.

THEY DID WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO,\nPROP UP THE REGIME BY GETTING THERE AND MAKING CERTAIN THAT\nTHE REGIME COULD NOT BE OVERTHROWN.\nTHAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED. WHAT'S NOT BEEN ACCOMPLISHED IS\nTHE SECOND PHASE, WHICH WAS TO RETAKE THE LOST TERRITORY THAT\nTHE OPPOSITION FORCES HAVE TAKEN AWAY FROM THE SYRIAN REGIME.\nTHAT HAS BEEN VERY SLOW GOING.

I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE\nSHORT. YOU DON'T SEEM TO BE MAKING SOME\nPROGRESS. SO WHAT HE'S -- THE CARD HE'S\nPLAYING, HE WANTS TO WORK WITH THE UNITED STATES, ALMOST\nDESPERATE ABOUT IT TO CONDUCT OPERATIONS AGAINST ISIS TO TAKE\nOFF SOME OF THIS POLITICAL PRESSURE.\nHE TOLD THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE THAT THE REASON HE MOVED INTO SYRIA\nWAS NOT TO PROP UP THE ASSAD REGIME, BUT TO GO AFTER ISIS.\nOF COURSE, THAT IS A BOLD FACED LIE AND THEY'VE DONE LITTLE OF\nTHAT.

AND WANTED AN EMERGENCY\nSESSION AND TRIED TO GET SOME RULING.\nWHAT WE HAVE IS WHAT WE HAVE SEEN BEFORE, IS A MISTAKE, WRONG\nTARGET, WRONG PLACE, AND WE WERE AFTER ISIS AND WOUND UP HITTING\nTHE SYRIAN ARMY POSITION. >> RIGHT AND I WAS JUST READING\nSAYING THAT RUSSIA REGISTERED 50 VIOLATIONS OF SYRIA CEASEFIRE\nAGREEMENT IN THE LAST 24 HOURS. AS YOU KNOW, GENERAL, RUSSIA IS\nALREADY USING THE AIRSTRIKER RA TO PROMOTE PROPAGANDA,\nSUGGESTING THE U.S. IS HELPING ISIS WHILE RUSSIA IS TRYING TO\nFIGHT ISIS IN SYRIA. WHAT'S THE REASON BEHIND THAT\nPARTICULAR PORTION OF THEIR PROPAGANDA MACHINE?\n>> PROPAGANDA IS VERY IMPORTANT, PSYCHOLOGICAL WAR FARE PUTIN IS\nA MASTER AT. RUSSIA HAS BEEN IN SYRIA NOW A\nYEAR. THEY DID WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO,\nPROP UP THE REGIME BY GETTING THERE AND MAKING CERTAIN THAT\nTHE REGIME COULD NOT BE OVERTHROWN.\nTHAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED. WHAT'S NOT BEEN ACCOMPLISHED IS\nTHE SECOND PHASE, WHICH WAS TO RETAKE THE LOST TERRITORY THAT\nTHE OPPOSITION FORCES HAVE TAKEN AWAY FROM THE SYRIAN REGIME.\nTHAT HAS BEEN VERY SLOW GOING. ALEPPO CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN GOING\nON FOR MONTHS. WHAT'S HAPPENING TO PUTIN AT\nHOME, HE'S STARTED TO GET SOME POLITICAL PRESSURE AT HOME IN\nTERMS OF WHAT'S GOING ON. I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE\nSHORT. YOU DON'T SEEM TO BE MAKING SOME\nPROGRESS. SO WHAT HE'S -- THE CARD HE'S\nPLAYING, HE WANTS TO WORK WITH THE UNITED STATES, ALMOST\nDESPERATE ABOUT IT TO CONDUCT OPERATIONS AGAINST ISIS TO TAKE\nOFF SOME OF THIS POLITICAL PRESSURE.\nHE TOLD THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE THAT THE REASON HE MOVED INTO SYRIA\nWAS NOT TO PROP UP THE ASSAD REGIME, BUT TO GO AFTER ISIS.\nOF COURSE, THAT IS A BOLD FACED LIE AND THEY'VE DONE LITTLE OF\nTHAT. THEY WANT TO NOW WORK WITH US\nAND THAT WILL ASSIST THEM POLITICALLY AT HOME.\n>> BEFORE I LET YOU GO, GENERAL, WHAT ABOUT THE POOR PEOPLE IN\nDESPERATE NEED OF HUMANITARIAN AID, ARE THEY GOING TO GET IT?\n>> PART OF THIS CEASEFIRE IS TO GUARANTOR THAT THERE WILL BE\nHUMANITARIAN AID THAT GETS TO SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE\nABSOLUTELY IN STARVATION AND ALSO SOME OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE\nBEEN LITERALLY UNDER GENOCIDE ATTACK.\nTHAT HAS NOT TAKEN PLACE YIT AND YET AND NOT WORKED IN THE PAST.\nHOPEFULLY IT WILL WORK HERE.

IS WHEN THE CHANCE FOR RAIN IS REALLY\nGOING TO TAKE OFF IN THE BOSTON\nAREA. SOME LINGERING SHOWERS INTO\nTOMORROW MORNING OVER\nSOUTHEASTERN MASS BUT SO FAR WE HAVE HAD ZERO RAIN IN BOSTON,\nSOME POINTS NORTH AND WEST OF\nBOSTON INTO WESTERN MASS, GETTING TWO, THREE INCHES OF\nRAIN, 73\u00c2\u00b0 AND 11:00 A.M. 75\u00c2\u00b0 AND\nSTORM CHANCES STARTING. THAT IS THE BATCH OF RAIN THAT'S\nACTUALLY MOVING OUT OF NEW YORK\nRIGHT NOW ON TRACK TO ARRIVE IN BOSTON AROUND 11:00 A.M. AND\nFROM THERE WE HAVE THE CHANCE\nFOR SOME -- COUPLE OF WAVES OF WET WEATHER HERE.\nSO TROPICAL MOISTURE JUST\nFEEDING INTO THE WHOLE THING. THE NEXT BATCH OF RAIN TO WATCH\nWILL BE THIS MASS JUST ARRIVING\nIN CONNECT AND THE TRAJECTORY OF THAT WILL BRING INTO BOSTON LIKE\nI SAID JUST BEFORE LUNCH TIME\nTODAY. SO DOPPLER RADAR IS LOOKING\nPRETTY UGLY.\nTHERE YOU GO NORTH OF THE MASS PIKE, ONE SWATH OF RAIN AND DOWN\nACROSS THE RAIN ANOTHER SWATH\nARRIVING ON OUTER CAPE PROVINCETOWN AND FUTURE CAST NOT\nQUITE WET ENOUGH IN MY OPINION,\n10:00 A.M. POCKETS OF HEAVY RAIN.\nLOOK AT THAT NOON TIME, TALK\nABOUT SOAKER IN AND AROUND BOSTON AND LIGHTNING AND GUSTY\nWIND AS WELL.\nONCE WE HIT THE DRIVE HOME FROM WORK, IT IS EASTERN AND\nSOUTHEASTERN MASSACHUSETTS\nWATCHING FOR THE STORMS AND EVEN OVERNIGHT TONIGHT THE CHANCE\nWILL EXIST OVER THE CAPE, 7-DAY\nFORECAST ALWAYS IN VIEW, VERY GRADUAL CLEARING NORTH TO THE\nSOUTH AND HIGHS IN 60s THIS\nWEEKEND.

YOU ARE SO RIGHT THAT YOU NEED\nTO HAVE COMPENSATIONS STRUCTURES THAT ARE VALID AND ALLOW PEOPLE\nTO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY AND WHEN YOU BLOW IT WITH THINGS LIKE\nTHIS, YOU UNDERMINE WHAT IS VALID ABOUT CORPORATE\nCOMPENSATION. >> LET'S DIG INTO THE DETAILS\nWHY THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT STRUCTURES.\nEPIPEN ITSELF, THIS IS A SITUATION THAT WOULD COST, WHAT,\n$29 TO MAKE. >> $29 TO MAKE THE PEN, YES.\n>> AND IT GOT JACKED UP TO ABOUT $600 BECAUSE OF WHAT\nCOMPENSATION STRUCTURE? >> I THINK THAT WHEN YOU LOOK\nRIGHT AFTER WHAT THEY PUT IN FOR TOP EXECUTIVES, A COMPENSATION\nSTRUCTURE THAT WOULD ALLOW, YOU KNOW, BIG, BIG BONUSES IF THERE\nWERE PROFITS, AND THAT'S WHEN THEY MOVE FROM UPPING THE COST\nOF THE PEN A MODEST AMOUNT EACH YEAR TO DOING IT AS FAST AS THEY\nPOSSIBLY COULD. I DON'T THINK THEY WERE DOING IT\nFOR ANY OTHER REASONS THAN SIMPLY TO MAKE MORE MONEY RIGHT\nAFTER A BONUS STRUCTURE WENT IN THAT WOULD HAVE REWARDED THAT\nFOR THE BIG EXECUTIVES. >> JUST VERY QUICKLY, LET'S\nDESCRIBE THE WELLS FARGO COMPENSATION STRUCTURES AS WELL,\nAND I THINK THIS ONE IS PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC,\nBECAUSE THIS IS A STRUCTURE THAT WAS IN PLACE FOR OVER FIVE\nYEARS, AND PEOPLE WERE GETTING BIG BONUSES AND THE COMPANY\nALREADY ADMITTED THEY WERE FIRING 5,000 PEOPLE OVER THE\nFIVE YEARS WHICH SHOULD HAVE SET UP SIGNALS THERE WAS SOMETHING\nWRONG. >> AND THEN YOU GET THE BIG\nBONUSES FOR THE PEOPLE -- THE WOMAN WHO WAS RUNNING THE RETAIL\nDIVISION. YOU CAN ALWAYS SMELL THAT\nTHERE'S SOMETHING WRONG. THEY SHOULD HAVE SMELLED THERE\nWAS SOMETHING WRONG THERE, JUST LIKE EPIPEN AND MYLAN SHOULD\nHAVE SMELLED SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH THEIR DOING, AND JACKING UP\nSOMETHING KIDS NEED AND SHOULD HAVE IN THEIR NAP SACKS, AND\nWHEN YOU ARE DOING THINGS LIKE THAT, I WONDER, HOW DO YOU GO TO\nSLEEP THAT WELL AT NIGHT? >> WALTER IT'S HARD TO PLAY\nDEVIL'S ADVOCATE IN THIS SITUATION, BUT LET ME TRY IF YOU\nJUST INDULGE ME. ON THE EPIPEN PIECE IS THERE\nANYTHING TO BE SAID ABOUT THE REGULATORY COMPONENT AROUND\nCOMPETITION, AROUND THE FACT THERE WAS NOT COMPETITION FOR\nTHIS DEVICE THAT WOULD HAVE PERHAPS KEPT THE PRICE OF IT\nDOWN? ON THE WELLS FARGO PIECE IT'S\nMUCH HARDER TO ARGUE, BY THE WAY, AND AGAIN, IS THERE AN\nARGUMENT TO BE MADE THAT ULTIMATELY EMPLOYEES HAVE TO BE\nETHICAL? I HAVE TALKED TO EMPLOYEES THAT\nFELT THE PRESSURE AND I APPRECIATE THE ISSUE BUT AT THE\nEND OF THE DAY DOING SOMETHING THAT IS WRONG IS STILL WRONG.\n>> YEAH, AND YOU ARE SAYING IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF MYLAN\nHAD A COMPETITOR FOR EPIPEN, OF COURSE.\nTHIS IS WHEN THINGS ARE FINE, WHEN YOU HAVE A MARKET WHERE\nSOMEBODY'S, YOU KNOW, TRYING TO PRICE GOUGE YOU OR WHATEVER AND\nYOU DON'T HAVE SUCH A TIGHT REGULATORY REGIME THAT YOU ARE\nALLOWED TO HAVE COMPETITION IN THE MARKETPLACE.\nWHAT I AM SAYING IS ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE BACKFIRING.\nYOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET LESS REGULATION BECAUSE OF WHAT MYLAN\nDID, AND YOU ARE NOW GOING TO WATCH CONGRESS GO INTO OVER\nDRIVE AND TRY TO PUT IN MORE REGULATIONS, BOTH ON, YOU KNOW,\nFOR CONSUMER PROTECTION WHETHER IT BE BANKS OR WHETHER IT BE\nSOMETHING LIKE THIS. SO ANYTHING IN WHICH YOU TRY TO\nUNDERMINE COMPETITION AND THEN PEOPLE MAKE USE OF THAT FACT TO\nREAP PROFITS THEY HAD NOT EARNED AND WOULD NOT HAVE IN A\nCOMPETITIVE MARKET UNDERMINES OUR ENTIRE SYSTEM OF THE\nMARKETPLACE. >> SO WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE\nADVISED HEATHER BRESCH IF THEY WERE THINKING ABOUT RAISING THE\nPRICE FOR EPIPEN AS THEY LOOKED AT THE MARKET?\nWHAT SHOULD HAVE CONVERSATION HAVE BEEN?\n>> LET'S THINK OF THE MANY STAKEHOLDERS AND NOT JUST THE\nSHORT TERM, BUT THE INTEREST OF THE QUARTER BUT THE LONG-TERM\nFOR THE COMPANY, AND ARE WE GOING TO END UP IN A BETTER\nREGULATORY ENVIRONMENT BASED ON THINGS WE DO?\nSECONDLY, LET'S LOOK AT OUR CUSTOMERS.\nYOU GO BACK TO STEVE JOBS AND HE DID A LOT OF THINGS AT APPLE AND\nHE SAID WHY ARE WE DOING THAT AND PUTTING THAT IN, AND HE SAID\nI AM DOING IT FOR THE CUSTOMER AND YOU LOOK IF THE CLIENTS AND\nCUSTOMERS TRUST YOU, AND STEVE JOBS SAID YOU WILL END UP MAKING\nMORE AND BEING A MORE VALUABLE COMPANY.\nTELL ME MYLAN IS A MORE VALUABLE COMPANY BECAUSE OF WHAT IT DID?\nOF COURSE NOT, AND NOT A MORE ETHICAL COMPANY FOR WHAT THEY\nDID. >> WHILE YOU ARE HERE I WANT TO\nTALK ABOUT THE CYBER SUMMIT COMING UP.\n>> WE WILL HAVE ANDREW THERE, AND BECKY AND JOE.\n>> ANDREW WILL INTERVIEW JOHN  AND I TALKED TO ADMIRAL ROGERS\nAND HE RUNS A CYBER AD AND HE WILL BE UP THERE.\nIT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT TIME FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR, THE BANKS\nAND THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WERE DOING IT AT M.I.T., AND WE\nARE DOING IT WHERE SOME OF THE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO REARCHITECT\nPARTS OF THE INTERNET, AND WE REALLY HAVE TO GET TO HOW CAN WE\nMAKE AN INTERNET THAT IS MORE VERIFIED AND MORE SECURE AND\nMORE TRUSTWORTHY WHEN WE ARE SEEING EVERYTHING FROM OUR BANKS\nTO OUR ELECTION INFRASTRUCTURE BEING THREATENED BY THIS SORT OF\nCORROSION OF THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE INTERNET.\n>> WALTER, WE HAVE TO GO. REAL QUICK, DO YOU THINK --\n>> BY THE WAY, IT'S OCTOBER 5th IN CAMBRIDGE.\n>> DO YOU THINK WE WILL SEE AN ELECTION WHERE YOU CAN VOTE BY\nYOUR PHONE ANYTIME SOON? >> I THINK THAT HAS BEEN SET\nBACK BY THE BEGINNINGS OF OUR WORRIES ABOUT RUSSIANS HAVING\nHACKED INTO VARIOUS PERIPHERIES OF THE POLITICAL SYSTEM.\nI THINK WE ARE GOING TO GO MORE LIKELY TO PAPER THAN TO GOING TO\nPHONE VOTING. >> WALTER, THANK YOU.\nGREAT TO SEE YOU AND WE WILL TALK TO YOU SOON.\n>> SEE YOU IN CAMBRIDGE, MY FRIEND.\n>> CAMBRIDGE, OCTOBER 5th.", "thumbnail": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1474290396040.1474286527177.b160bd88-8f36-43e0-8f3d-d16b47e2fbcc.segment5.thumb.jpg", "channel": "355"}, {"start": 126500, "length": 1257390.0, "end": 1383890, "date": 1474288546578, "url": "http://um-bubble.media.mit.edu:10022/static/1474292128379.http-um-bubble-media-mit-edu-10022-static-1474288332072-0ef5e6d3-36a3-475b-b676-468e1baf10d5-mp4_nocom.mp4#t=126.50,1383.89", "text": ">> THANK YOU FOR THAT.\n>>> IN THE MEANTIME, A BIG WEEK AHEAD FOR THE MARKETS AS THE FED\nHOLD'S ITS MUCH-TALKED ABOUT HEARING.\nWE CAN TALK POLITICS AND OTHER ISSUES.\nI WANT TO START WITH THE FED, WHICH IS TO SAY LAST WEEK WE\nTALKED TO TIM GEITHNER AND RAY DALIO, BOTH ABOUT WHAT THE FEDS\nSHOULD OR SHOULD NOT DO. THEY BOTH SEEMED CONCERNED ABOUT\nRAISING INTEREST RATES, AND HISTORICALLY YOU HAVE SUGGESTED\nYOU THINK THESE LOW INTEREST RATES MAY BE CREATING SOME\nADVERSE BUBBLES IN THE MARKETS. I WANT TO SEE WHERE YOU STAND\nTHESE DAYS? >> ANDREW, IT'S A COMPLICATED\nSITUATION. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE GOT GROWTH\nSTILL BUMPING ALONG IN THE U.S. AT, YOU KNOW, LESS THAN 2%.\nTHERE'S NO VISIBLE SIGNS OF INFLATION.\nWE HAVE GROWTH SLOWING AROUND THE WORLD.\nYOU HAVE GOT NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES IN EUROPE AND JAPAN AND\nELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD. ON THE OTHER HAND, AS I HAVE\nSAID BEFORE, YOU KNOW, THESE EXTRAORDINARILY LOW RATES CAUSE\nBIG DISLOCATIONS AND MISALLOCATIONS TO THE CAPITAL\nINCREASING THE RISK IN THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM, AND YOU SEE --\nTHANK YOU. GROOMING.\nI CAN ALWAYS USE A LITTLE HELP. AND ALSO, ACCENTUATING AN INCOME\nDISPARITY. >> RIGHT.\n>> AS I LOOK AT IT, THAT'S NOT THE BIG ISSUE.\nTHE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES ISSUE IS THIS.\nMARKETS ARE FOCUSING ON WHETHER INTEREST RATES SHOULD REMAIN AT\nALMOST ZERO OR GO UP TO SLIGHTLY MORE THAN ALMOST ZERO.\nAND I THINK THE MEGAQUESTIONS ARE MUCH BIGGER THAN THAT, AND\nTHE FIRST ONE IS WHY, WITH INTERESTS SO FAR BELOW OUR\nPOTENTIAL WHY DON'T WE SEE OUR GOVERNMENT DEALING WITH THE\nMAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES WE NEED TO TAKE TO RESTORE GROWTH AND I\nAM TALKING ABOUT ENTITLEMENTS AND TAX REFORM AND IMMIGRATION\nREFORM. BUT THE SECOND ISSUE, WHICH IS\nOF EQUAL CONCERN TO ME, IS THAT WITH GROWTH SLOWING ALMOST\nEVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD, AND WITH INTEREST RATES\nEXTRAORDINARILY LOW, AND WITH DEBT INCREASING AT THE FEDERAL\nLEVEL AT A MUCH HIGHER LEVEL IN GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD,\nWHAT TOOLS ARE POLICYMAKERS GOING TO HAVE TO AVOID AND\nPREVENT A SLIDE INTO A RECESSION OR, GOD FORBID, PULL US OUT OF\nONE OR HELP US RESPOND TO A CRISIS?\nWE ARE IN UNCHARTERED ECONOMIC TERRITORY.\n>> THE QUESTION IS WHEN? WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR WHEN\nAND WHEN DO YOU GO AND RAISE THE RATE.\n>> I GUESS AS I LOOK AT IT, WHETHER THEY RAISE THE RATES --\nBUMP THEM UP A BIT IN SEPTEMBER OR DECEMBER OR EARLY NEXT YEAR,\nWE'RE STILL LOOKING AT A WORLD WHERE -- I DON'T SEE ANY\nSIGNIFICANT OR QUICK INCREASE IN RATES ANYTIME SOON.\n>> YOU THINK IT'S A RISK? >> I LOOK AT IT AND SAY RATES\nARE GOING TO BE LOW FOR A LONG TIME.\nAGAIN, I HAVE WATCHED MARKETS FOR A LONG TIME AND I UNDERSTAND\nWHY PEOPLE RING THEIR HANDS OVER THERE THIS, BUT GIVE ME A BREAK.\nWE'RE EITHER GOING TO -- RATES ARE GOING TO NUDGE UP A LITTLE\nBIT, AS I SAID SLIGHTLY ABOVE ZERO, YOU KNOW, AND IN\nSEPTEMBER, DECEMBER, EARLY NEXT YEAR, AND AGAIN, I THINK WE'RE\nIN UNCHARTERED TERRITORY HERE AND WHAT I AM FOCUSED ON IS WE\nNEED BIG STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN OUR ECONOMY TO RESTORE OUR\nECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS, AND I'M WORRIED BY WHAT I SEE AROUND\nTHE WORLD. >> YOU BELIEVE, BY THE WAY, THE\nFED IS AFFECTIVELY ALLOWING CONGRESS NOT TO DO ITS JOB?\n>> YEAH, THEY ARE IN A TOUGH SPOT.\nWHAT HAPPENS IS ALMOST EVERYWHERE I LOOK, AND LET ME\nTELL YOU, THE UNITED STATES IS A BRIGHT SPOT.\nOUR ECONOMY HAS FEWER PROBLEMS THAN ANY OTHER MAJOR ECONOMY\nAROUND THE WORLD. EVERYWHERE I LOOK I SEE ECONOMIC\nPOLICIES THAT USED TO WORK ARE NOT WORKING AS WELL AS THEY NEED\nTO AND I DON'T CARE WHETHER YOU ARE DEALING WITH AUTHORITARIAN\nGOVERNMENTS LIKE RUSSIA OR CHINA OR DEMOCRACIES IN THE WEST, AND\nSTRUCTURAL CHANGES AREN'T FORTHCOMING AND SO CENTRAL BANKS\nARE THE ONES TRYING TO GET US OUT OF THIS PROBLEM, AND TO ME\nWITH INTEREST RATES WHERE THEY ARE RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW, THEY\nARE NOT PROVIDING MUCH JUICE. I DO RECOGNIZE THAT IF YOU ARE\nTHE CHAIRMAN OF THE FED AND YOU ARE LOOKING AT A SITUATION WHERE\nTHERE IS NO SIGN OF INFLATION, AND NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES IN\nJAPAN, IN EUROPE AND SWITZERLAND AND SWEDEN IN DENMARK, AND\nGROWTH DECLINING AROUND THE WORLD, IT SEEMS LIKE AND I GUESS\nIT'S A BIG DECISION, BUT AGAIN IT'S NOT THE BIG ISSUE.\nTHE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES ISSUE IS WHAT I HAVE JUST GONE\nTHROUGH. >> REALISTICALLY WHAT KIND OF\nGROWTH RATE DO YOU THINK YOU CAN SEE IN THIS COUNTRY, AND I ASK\nIN THE CONTEXT DONALD TRUMP SUGGESTED 4% IS NOT UNREALISTIC,\nWE COULD GET BACK THERE IF THE RIGHT STEPS WERE TAKEN IN\nWASHINGTON. >> LET ME SAY THIS, AND ONE\nTHING I DO BELIEVE IS WE ARE NOT GROWING AT ANYTHING NEAR OUR\nCAPACITY, SO WHETHER IT'S 3%, 3.5 OR 4%.\nWE ARE NOT GOING TO GET WHERE WE NEED TO GET UNLESS YOU SEE BIG,\nDIFFICULT STRUCTURAL REFORMS IN THE U.S.\n>> WHICH WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE THROUGH CONGRESS TO DO.\nNOW IT'S NOT JUST CONGRESS, IT'S THE GOVERNMENT RIGHT NOW.\nI MEAN, CONGRESS COULD WRITE A BEAUTIFUL TAX REFORM BILL THAT\nIS NEVER GOING TO GET SIGNED. I MEAN, IT'S INTRACTABLE BECAUSE\nOF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AND CONGRESS.\nWE NEED CHANGES AT BOTH MOST LIKELY TO EVER EFFECT ANYTHING\nLIKE THE REFORMS WE NEED TO GROW FASTER.\n>> YOU HAVE BEEN A BIG SUPPORTER OF CHINA AND OPEN TRADE ON BOTH\nSIDES WHEN YOU HEAR IT, THE TPP, BOTH SIDES, HILLARY CLINTON OR\nDONALD TRUMP, THEY SEEM MORE TO BE ABOUT CLOSING THINGS DOWN AND\nWHAT DOES THAT DO TO OUR GROWTH RATE?\n>> I HAVE BEEN A BIG SUPPORTER OF THE U.S./CHINA RELATIONSHIP,\nAND I SAID THAT'S BY FAR THE MOST IMPORTANT BILATERAL\nRELATIONSHIP WE HAVE AND I SEE ONE THAT IS GOING TO BE\nINCREASINGLY UNDER STRESS, AND SO I, YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S\nIMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN A CONSTRUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP,\nBECAUSE IT'S IN OUR BEST INTEREST TO DO SO.\nYOU RAISED ANOTHER ISSUE, WHICH IS MY BIG CONCERN WHICH IS\nPROTECTIONISM. >> RIGHT.\n>> I JUST THINK IT'S DEPLORABLE RIGHT NOW THE LEVEL OF\nPROTECTION OR SENTIMENT WE SEE IN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE\nTRADE AND CROSS BORDER INVESTMENT ARE BIG IN DRIVING\nGROWTH AND ESSENTIAL IN PROTECTION IN OUR\nCOMPETITIVENESS, AND THEY ARE BEING BLAMED FOR PROBLEMS THAT\nWHILE THE FACT IS THAT THE AVERAGE AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD HAS\nAN INCOME -- A HOUSEHOLD INCOME THAT IS $10,000 HIGHER AS A\nRESULT OF THIS TRADE BOOM WE HAVE HAD SINCE WORLD WAR II.\n>> HOW DO YOU GET THE PUBLIC TO BELIEVE THAT?\nHOW DO YOU ARTICULATE THAT IN A WAY --\n>> ANDREW, THAT'S THE QUESTION. THE PROBLEM WITH TRADE IS SIMPLY\nTHIS. THE BENEFITS ARE SPREAD OVER THE\nENTIRE ECONOMY AND THERE ARE VERY REAL JOB LOSSES THAT COME\nFROM TRADE THAT HIT SPECIFIC SECTORS, BUT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM\nIS THAT MOST OF THE JOB LOSSES WE ARE SEEING TODAY IN MY\nJUDGMENT AREN'T COMING FROM TRADE BUT ARE COMING FROM\nODDMATION, ADVANCED IN TECHNOLOGY, WHICH BENEFIT THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE GREATLY AND IT BENEFITS SOCIETY, BUT ARE\nDEFINITELY DISRUPTING THE LABOR MARKETS AND DESTROYING MORE JOBS\nTHAN CREATING AND HOLLOWING OUT THE MIDDLE CLASS.\n>> THAT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE TAKING ONE ANIME AND\nSUBSTITUTING IT FOR ANOTHER? >> NO, I AM TAKING A FACT, OKAY?\nI AM TAKING A FACT THAT YOU LOOK AT ALMOST EVERY INDUSTRY TODAY,\nAND WHAT YOU SEE ARE -- WHETHER IT'S ARCHITECTURE, ENGINEERING,\nLAW, BUSINESS, ANYTHING THAT CAN BE AUTOMATED IS, AND IT IS\nCREATING DISRUPTIONS IN THE MARKETPLACE.\n>> WE HAVE SEEN IT FOR DECADES BUT IT'S HAPPENING FASTER?\n>> IT'S HAPPENING AT A MUCH FASTER CLIP, BUT I THINK WE HAVE\nTO DO A BETTER JOB OF EXPLAINING TRADE.\nIT'S NEVER BEEN EASY, AND IT'S NEVER BEEN POPULAR.\nI WAS VERY PLEASED TO SEE THAT THE WHITE HOUSE CALLED A MEETING\nON FRIDAY TO REALLY FOCUS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TRANCE PACIFIC\nPARTNERSHIP, TPP, BECAUSE THIS IS, AGAIN, HUGELY IMPORTANT,\nBECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I JUST MADE ARGUMENTS ABOUT TRADE, WHICH I\nREALLY BELIEVE IN, BUT THE TPP GOES BEYOND THAT BECAUSE OUR\nMARKETS ARE VERY OPEN, AND THEY ARE THE MOST OPEN IN THE WORLD.\nWE HAVE THE LOWEST TARIFFS, AND THE FEWEST TARIFFS.\nWHAT THE TPP DOES, EVEN IF PEOPLE ARE NOT ENTHUSIASTIC\nABOUT TRADE IN THE U.S. HOW COULD THEY OPPOSE TPP BECAUSE\nIT'S OPENING UP MARKETS AND FOR THE DIGITAL MARKET WHICH WILL\nBENEFIT YOU, AND GEOPOLITICALLY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT, BECAUSE\nTHE UNITED STATES -- IT'S ABOUT U.S. LEADERSHIP.\nTHE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA HAS SAID WE ARE GOING TO DO THIS\nAGREEMENT, AND WE HAVE OUR ALLIES, YOU KNOW, TRUSTING US,\nAND WE HAVE COUNTRIES LIKE VIETNAM AND MALAYSIA WILLING TO\nBREAK WITH THEIR PAST AND BECOME PART OF OUR SYSTEM, AND VIETNAM\nLOOKING AT CHANGING THEIR CONSTITUTION.\nIF WE CAN'T DELIVER ON THIS, HOW ARE WE AN ECONOMIC LEADER?\n>> THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T HAVE THE VOTES, IN HIS OWN PARTY HE\nDOESN'T HAVE THE VOTES. >> WE WILL HAVE TO GET THE VOTES\nBECAUSE IT'S JUST TOO IMPORTANT NOT TO, YOU KNOW.\n>> THE CHANCES ARE, WHAT AT THIS POINT?\n10%? >> I DON'T WANT TO, YOU KNOW --\nTRADE VOTES, JOE, ARE NEVER EASY.\nTHEY ARE NEVER EASY FOR REPUBLICANS AND THEY ARE NEVER\nEASY FOR DEMOCRATS, BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE STRONG, STRONG\nLEADERSHIP FROM THE WHITE HOUSE AND TAKE LEANING ON DEMOCRATS\nAND PRESIDENT CALLING IN SHIFTS AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO TAKE,\nI THINK, BUSINESS DOING A MUCH BETTER JOB OF GOING INTO\nINDIVIDUAL DISTRICTS SO THERE'S A COST THAT THE CONGRESSIONAL --\nTHE CONGRESSMEN HAVE FOR VOTING AGAINST TPP.\n>> YOU WROTE A VERY AGGRESSIVE, IF I COULD CALL IT THAT, OP ED\nIN THE WASHINGTON POST THIS YEAR ABOUT DONALD TRUMP.\nYOU ARE A REPUBLICAN AND WERE APPOINTED BY GEORGE W. BUSH AND\nHERE YOU WERE CALLING HIM A PHONEY AND IN THE RECESS SAYING\nYOU WERE VOTING FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nI WANT TO UNDERSTAND YOUR THINKING PROCESS AND WHAT THE\nREACTION HAS BEEN AMONG PEOPLE IN YOUR WORLD?\n>> FIRST OF ALL, THE REACTION -- LET ME JUST TELL YOU.\nPEOPLE IN GENERAL, WHAT YOU DO IS THE PEOPLE UNHAPPY YOU DON'T\nHEAR FROM, AND THE PEOPLE THAT LIKE IT SAY YOU ARE THE MAN,\nOKAY? IT'S THE SAME WITH THE T.A.R.P.\nI KNOW MOST OF THE PEOPLE ARE AGAINST THE ACTIONS WE HAVE\nTAKEN, AND I NEVER HAD A SINGLE PERSON COME UP TO ME AND SAY YOU\nARE A JERK FOR DOING THIS, AND THEY COME UP AND SAY THANK YOU\nFOR SAVING OUR COUNTRY AND THAT'S THE NATURE OF PEOPLE THAT\nARE POLITE. IN TERMS OF -- I AM A\nREPUBLICAN. I AM VERY SUPPORTIVE OF PAUL\nRYAN. I AM VERY SUPPORTIVE OF A MITCH\nMcCONNELL. I HAVE BEEN WORKING HARD, GIVING\nMONEY AND WORKING HARD TO ELECT REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE AND\nTHE HOUSE. I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT\nWE KEEP OUR LEADERSHIP POSITION THERE.\nTHE REASON I SAID I WAS GOING TO VOTE FOR HILLARY IS AS I LOOK AT\nTHE WORLD TODAY, I HAVE SAID REPEATEDLY, WE NEED BIG\nDIFFICULT STRUCTURAL REFORMS TO GET OUR U.S. ECONOMY GOING, AND\nI BELIEVE THAT THE BEST OPPORTUNITY TO GET THOSE IS WHEN\nYOU HAVE DIVIDED GOVERNMENT AND YOU NEED SOMEONE AS A LEADER WHO\nHAS A TEMPERAMENT THAT ALLOWS HIM OR HER TO COMPROMISE, TO BE\nABLE TO SAY, YOU KNOW, I UNDERSTAND THE OTHER SIDE, AND\nI'M NOT GOING TO DEMONIZE THEM AND FIND MIDDLE GROUND AND GET\nSOMETHING DONE AND THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN DO THAT, AND\nTHE PRESIDENT HAS TO LEAN ACROSS AND LEAN AGAINST THEIR PARTY.\n>> BUT SHE WOULD NEED TO DO THINGS DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED TO\nWHAT SHE BELIEVES. \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\"S WHICH\nHAS NOT BEEN POSITIVE ABOUT TRUMP AT ALL, AND CALLED HIS\nPOLICIES IN STARK CONTRAST OF WHAT HILLARY WANTED TO DO WITH\nTHE COUNTRY, TOTALLY DIFFERENT. 90% OF PAUL RYAN'S INITIATIVES\nHAVE BEEN HIJACKED BY DONALD TRUMP IN HIS SPEECH, AND YOU\nHAVE TEMPERAMENT CONDITIONS, AND 60% OF THE COUNTRY THINKS SHE IS\nUNTRUSTWORTHY, AND LOOKING AT POLICIES, REPUBLICAN POLICIES\nARE BEING PUT FORTH MUCH MORE READILY BY TRUMP THAN -- IT\nOCCURRED TO ME THAT IT'S DISINGENUOUS FOR YOU TO -- SHE\nWOULD HAVE TO TOTALLY CHANGE HER ECONOMIC POLICIES TO GET IN LINE\nWITH YOUR POLICIES? >> I DID NOT COME HERE TO DEBATE\nPOLITICS WITH YOU, BUT I WOULD SIMPLY SAY THAT I READ ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP'S SPEECH, YOU KNOW. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET ME TO\nSIGN ON TO ANY ECONOMIC POLICY THAT DOESN'T DEAL WITH OUR\nBALLOONING DEBT AND ENTITLEMENTS AND TAKES THE, YOU KNOW,\nEXORBITANT VIEWS BEING TAKEN THERE ON TRADE, BUT TO ME, TO\nME, IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO TWO THINGS.\nAS I SAID, IT COMES DOWN TO CHARACTER AND TEMPERAMENT AND AN\nABILITY TO WORK ACROSS THE AISLE, AND I WATCHED SECRETARY\nCLINTON WHEN SHE WAS A SENATOR DO THAT, OKAY?\nALSO, I WOULD TAKE -- YOU LEARN A LOT WHEN YOU ARE SECRETARY OF\nSTATE, AND I WOULD -- TO ME, I WOULD TAKE THAT EXPERIENCE ANY\nDAY. I SAID WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY\nABOUT DONALD TRUMP IN MY -- IN MY OP ED IN THE \"WASHINGTON\nPOST.\" I CAN'T SIGN ON TO THE SORT OF\nPOP POP YAO LIZAM, AND I AM WHERE I AM AND I AM A REPUBLICAN\nAND I AM HOPING WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A MAJORITY IN THE SENATE,\nAND I AM HOPING WE WILL HAVE A BIG MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE, AND I\nAM HOPING -- >> TO STOP HILLARY DOING\nANYTHING OF THE RAISING TAXES AND MAYBE THE REPUBLICANS WILL\nSTOP HER FROM DOING ALL THE THINGS WE KNOW SHE WILL DO THAT\nARE WRONG? >> MAYBE WE WILL COMPROMISE TO\nGET SOME OF THE BIG DIFFICULT THINGS DONE.\n>> OKAY. >> AND LASTLY, I HAVE GOT A\n94-YEAR-OLD MOTHER AND I HAVE THREE GRAND DAUGHTERS, AND I\nHAVE A WIFE THAT WOULD LIKE TO SEE A WOMAN PRESIDENT, AND YOU\nKNOW WHAT? I THINK I WILL THROW IN WITH\nTHEM. >> FAIR ENOUGH.\nBEFORE YOU GO YOU HAVE A NEW IMPORTANT PAPER OUT ON CHINA AND\nI WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT IT BEFORE WE GO.\nYOU TALK ABOUT THE IDEA THERE'S GOING TO BE MUCH MORE DIRECT\nINVESTMENT FROM CHINA INTO THE UNITED STATES IN THE COMING\nYEARS. HOW SHOULD WE AS A COUNTRY THINK\nABOUT THAT RELATIVE TO ALL OF THE ISSUES WE JUST TALKED ABOUT?\n>> WELL, THE FOREIGN INVESTMENT LIKE TRADE IS VERY UNPOPULAR AT\nTHE MACRO LEVEL. VERY POPULAR FOREIGNERS BUYING\nU.S. ASSETS. YOU ARE SHOWING LONG-TERM\nCONFIDENCE AND FOREIGN INVESTMENT HAS GOT THE\nPOTENTIAL, INCLUDING INVESTMENT FROM CHINA TO INCREASE JOBS AND\nMAINTAIN JOBS, AND SO TO ME, IN TODAY'S WORLD, YOU ARE GOING TO\nSEE INCREASINGLY FIERCE COMPETITION FOR INVESTMENT, AND\nIT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE WELCOME INVESTMENT THAT IS GOING\nTO HELP OUR ECONOMY. AND I LOOK AT -- I WROTE THAT\nPAPER BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE FUNDAMENTALS MEAN THERE WILL BE\nMUCH MORE OUTGOING INVESTMENT FROM CHINA, AND IT'S GOING TO BE\nMUCH MORE DRIVEN BY PRIVATE SECTOR COMPANIES COMPARED TO AS\nOPPOSED TO STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES, AND IT'S GOING TO\nBE FOCUSED ON -- IT GOING TO BE DRIVEN BY A NUMBER OF THINGS,\nCOMPANIES THAT HAVE BIG BUSINESS IN CHINA ARE LOOKING TO BECOME\nGLOBAL COMPANIES, AND LOOKING TO GET TO CONSUMERS, SERVICES, AND\nADVANCED MANUFACTURING, AND SO THEY ARE -- YOU ARE GOING TO SEE\nTHIS COMING TO THE UNITED STATES AND THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF MY\nPAPER WAS TO MAKE THE CASE THAT A LOT OF THIS IS INVESTMENT THAT\nWE SHOULD WELCOME. >> WE COULD COMPARE THAT TO THE\nJAPANESE WHEN THEY WERE BUYING PEBBLE BEACH THAT WAS UNPOPULAR.\n>> YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. WE HATE THE FACT, AND I REMEMBER\nWHEN THE JAPANESE INVESTMENT WAS COMING IN AND THEY WOULD BE VERY\nCONCERNED, PEBBLE BEACH AND ROCKEFELLER CENTER, AND I WOULD\nSAY THEY ARE GOING TO STAY IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\nAND WE ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE THEM TO JAPAN.\nWE HAVE GOT THEM AND THE CAPITAL.\nI THINK WHAT MAKES THIS MORE COMPLICATED IS BECAUSE PEOPLE\nARE RAISING ISSUES ABOUT CHINA, AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME\nACCESS, AND THERE ARE SUBSIDIES TO STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES AND\nDON'T PLAY ON A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD, AND IT'S A DANGEROUS\nTHING IF YOU START GOING DOWN A TIT FOR TAT APPROACH BECAUSE THE\nFACT IS REGARDLESS OF WHAT CHINA DOES, WE -- WHY SHOULD WE TURN\nOUR BACK ON INVESTMENT THAT HELPS THE UNITED STATES, NUMBER\nONE? NUMBER TWO, THIS INVESTMENT\nPROVIDES LINKS, AND THESE ECONOMIC LINKAGES ARE VERY\nIMPORTANT. THIRDLY, I AM IN SUPPORT OF THE\nBILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATY, BECAUSE WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO --\nTHE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS STILL VERY SERIOUS ABOUT NEGOTIATING\nTHIS WITH THE CHINESE AND MAKING PROGRESS, BECAUSE REFORMERS IN\nCHINA USE THE BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATY AS A LEVER TO\nOPEN UP THEIR PERFORMANCE AND LEVERAGE TO COMPETITION.\n>> HANK PAULSON, THANK YOU FOR TOUCHING ON SO MANY DIFFERENT\nSUBJECTS THIS MORNING.
