DESPITE ALL THE NAME CALLING\nGOING ON BACK AND FORTH, JOHN, A NUMBER OF VOTERS WE TALK TO,\nSOME OF THOSE OUT HERE, SAY THEY'RE HOPING TO HEAR MORE\nABOUT ISSUES. ONCE AGAIN, WE'RE GOING TO HEAR\nABOUT THE DEPLORABLES.

HIS DAUGHTER IVANKA WILL BE\nTHERE WITH HIM APPARENTLY SHE HELPED HIM CRAFT SOME OF THIS\nPROPOSAL.

GREAT TO BE WITH YOU.\n>> STRAIGHT UP. IS THIS THE LEAST TRANSPARENT\nELECTION YOU'VE EVER SEEN? >> WELL, IT HAS TO BE ONE OF\nTHEM. NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.\nIT'S UNBELIEVABLE THAT DONALD TRUMP WON'T RELEASE HIS TAX\nRETURNS. I DON'T THINK HE'S GOING TO\nBEFORE THE ELECTION. I THINK THAT SHOULD BE A\nREQUIREMENT, ABSOLUTELY. HE IS CLEARLY HIDING SOMETHING.\nWHY ELSE WOULD HE NOT RELEASE THEM.\nHIS EXCUSE THAT HE IS BEING AUDITED AND THEREFORE CAN'T\nRELEASE THEM IS SIMPLY UNTRUE. THERE IS NO REASON WHY HE\nCOULDN'T STILL RELEASE THEM NOW. HE IS CLEARLY HIDING SOMETHING.\nTHE QUESTION IS WHAT. >> YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY\nONE WHO HAS QUESTIONED THAT, THOUGH OF COURSE HE WOULD SAY HE\nIS NOT. HE IS BEING AUDITED.\nSTILL NO PROOF OF THAT.

WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIM NOW?\n>> RIGHT. LOOK, A LEADER IN THIS COUNTRY\nSHOULD NEVER MISS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONDEMN SOMEONE LIKE DAVID\nDUKE. A GRAND WIZARD OR WHATEVER HE\nWAS IN THE KKK. LEADERS CAN'T MISS THOSE\nOPPORTUNITIES. AND FOR PENCE TO AVOID SAYING\nTHAT DAVID DUKE IS DEPLORABLE OR, MORE IMPORTANTLY, RENOUNCING\nTHE SUPPORT THAT THE TRUMP/PENCE CAMPAIGN IS RECEIVING FROM A\nRACIST MOVEMENT KNOWN AS THE ALT-RIGHT MOVEMENT IN THE UNITED\nSTATES. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT BOTH OF\nTHEM NEED TO CONDEMN. THIS IS A CAMPAIGN THAT HAS\nATTRACTED THE SUPPORT OF RACISTS BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP'S RHETORIC\nHAS BEEN BIGOTED.

THEY WOULD HEN GIVE THAT MONEY\nOUT AND MAKE IT SEEM LIKE THIS WAS HIS MONEY.\nYOU SAW THAT LONG PIECE. IT'S GENERATING A LOT OF\nCOMMOTION OUT THERE. >> IT IS.\nAND YOU ASKED MIKE PENCE ABOUT IT.\nHE SAID DONALD TRUMP HAS GIVEN TENS OF MILLIONS TO CHARITIES,\nTO CAUSES THROUGH HIS CHARITIES. OF COURSE, THE QUESTION THAT YOU\nASKED IS WHERE IS THE PROOF OR THE DOCUMENTATION.\n>> LET'S LISTEN TO WHAT MIKE PENCE JUST TOLD ME.\n>> ANYONE WHO KNOWS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND HIS CAREER KNOWS THAT\nTHIS IS A MAN WHO HAS GIVEN AWAY TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO\nCHARITABLE CAUSES THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF HIS BUSINESS LIFE.\nHE'S BEEN INCREDIBLY GENEROUS. >> YOU READ THAT LONG STORY AND\nIT'S VERY DETAILED, THE WRITER OF THAT STORY WORKED ON IT FOR A\nLONG, LONG TIME. >> MY COLLEAGUE HAS DUG INTO\nDONALD TRUMP'S CHARITABLE GIVING.\nHE FOUND THERE WERE A COUPLE OF INSTANCES WHERE ORGANIZATIONS\nHAVE SAID THEY DON'T HAVE ANY RECORD OF A DONATION FROM THE\nTRUMP FOUNDATION. HE ALSO FOUND THAT THE TRUMP\nFOUNDATION -- DONALD TRUMP HASN'T GIVEN MONEY TO HIS OWN\nFOUNDATION SINCE 2008. I DON'T KNOW THIS IS GOING TO BE\nA PIVOTAL, DECIDING ISSUE IN THE CAMPAIGN, BUT IT GOES TO THIS\nIDEA THAT DONALD TRUMP IS NOT ALWAYS FORTHRIGHT ABOUT HIS\nCHARITABLE GIVING AND THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS SAID IN THE\nPAST HE KNOWS HOW TO GAME THE SYSTEM.\nAND NOW HE'S TRYING TO FIX THE SYSTEM.\nBUT IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD WHEN THERE IS SOME SUGGESTION THAT HE\nDID. >> ON THE WHOLE ISSUE OF BASKET\nOF DEPLORABLES, A PHRASE THAT HILLARY CLINTON USED TO DESCRIBE\nINITIALLY SHE SAID HALF OF DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTERS, LATER\nSHE SAID SHE REGRETTED SAYING \"HALF,\" BUT SAID SO MANY OF HIS\nSUPPORTERS THAT ARE ENGAGED IN RACISM AND BIGOTRY AND ALL SORTS\nOF OTHER FORMS OF HORRIBLE BEHAVIOR.\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS EFFECTIVELY GOING OUT THERE AND\nARGUING THIS WAS AWFUL, SHE SHOULD NOT SMEAR MILLIONS OF\nHARDWORKING AMERICANS WHO SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP.\n>> YEAH, AND I THINK DONALD TRUMP IS DOING IT QUITE\nEFFECTIVELY, HONESTLY. I THINK THAT THEY HAVE FOUND AN\nISSUE THAT THEY KNOW RESONATES WITH THEIR BASE.\nI'M NOT SURE IT WILL CONVINCE A PERSUADABLE VOTER ONE WAY OR\nANOTHER, BUT IT IS A MOTIVATOR FOR PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT DONALD\nTRUMP TO GET OUT THERE AND VOTE BECAUSE THEY FEEL THAT THEY WERE\nBEING DISMISSED BY HILLARY CLINTON AND BY THE WAY, THEY'RE\nNOT DEPLORABLE AND NOT RACIST, ET CETERA, ET CETERA.\nI THINK HILLARY TRIED TO WALK THAT BACK TO A DEGREE.\n>> IT PUTS HER ON DEFENSE. >> IT DOES.\n>> LISTEN TO WHAT MIKE PENCE TOLD ME ON THIS ISSUE.\nLISTEN TO THIS. >> I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHY THE\nMEDIA KEEPS DROPPING DAVID DUKE'S NAME.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS DROPPED DAVID DUKE REPEATEDLY.\nWE DON'T WANT HIS SUPPORT. >> YOU WOULD CALL HIM\nDEPLORABLE? >> I'M NOT IN THE NAME-CALLING\nBUSINESS, WOLF. >> HE'S GETTING SOME HEAT TO\nREFUSE TO CALL DAVID DUKE DEPLORABLE IN THAT SPECIFIC\nSEGMENT, ALTHOUGH EARLIER, HE DID SAY I DON'T WANT HIS SUPPORT\nOR THE SUPPORT OF HIS SUPPORTERS.\n>> I UNDERSTAND WHY A POLITICIAN MIGHT NOT WANT TO FEEL LIKE THEY\nCAN BEING BAITED INTO SAYING ANYTHING.\nBUT DAVID DUKE IS NOT DEPLORABLE, WHO IS?\nTHAT WORD CEASES TO HAVE MEANING IF YOU DIDN'T DESCRIBE DAVID\nDUKE IN THOSE TERMS. IT TOOK DONALD TRUMP A VERY LONG\nTIME WHETHER OR NOT HE DISAVOWED DAVID.\nHE HAS A LOT OF WHITE SUPREMIST SUPPORTERS.\n>> HILLARY CLINTON HAS TWEETED ABOUT THAT EXCHANGE SAYING --\nCOMPLAINING THAT HE DIDN'T CALL DAVID DUKE DEPLORABLE.\n>> SHE SAID BASICALLY IF YOU CAN'T CALL THE KKK DEPLORABLE,\nWHAT CAN YOU CALL DEPLORABLE?

THAT WAS IN REFERENCE TO MITT\nROMNEY'S 47% COMMENT.

WHEN YOU WANT TO BE PRESIDENT OF\nTHE UNITED STATES, IT'S R REPREHENSIBLE TO CHARACTERIZE --\n>> THEY MIGHT BE EQUALLY REPREHENSIBLE --\n>> DONALD TRUMP NEVER DID THAT. >> YES, HE DID.\n>> HE NEVER DID THAT. >> IN IS ALWAYS A MISTAKE FOR A\nCANDIDATE TO IMPUGN THE MOTIVES OF THE PEOPLE RUNNING FOR THE\nOTHER SIDE. IT'S NEVER A GOOD IDEA.\nHAVING SAID THAT, IT IS TOO SIMPLE TO DESCRIBE THIS AS A\nGAFFE THAT WOULD HURT HER. THE FUNDAMENTAL DIVIDING LINE\nBETWEEN THE TWO COALITIONS IS -- IT IS OVERWHELMINGLY COMPOSED OF\nTHE GROUPS MOST COMFORTABLE WITH THE INCREASINGLY DIVERSE\nCULTURALLY AND RACIAL SOCIETY WE'RE EVOLVING INTO AND TAKING\nON THIS FIGHT, HILLARY CLINTON IS PORTRAYING HERSELF AS\nDEFENDING THOSE VALUES AGAINST A CANDIDATE THAT THEY VIEW AS\nUNIQUELY THREATENING TO THOSE VALUES.\nSO IN THE SAME WAY THAT THIS IS I THINK DONALD TRUMP IS GOING\nTO, YOU KNOW, BAT, YOU KNOW, BANG ON THIS TO MOBILIZE HIS\nBASE, IT IS SOMETHING THAT UNIFIES THE MODERN DEMOCRATIC\nCOALITION. HIS KEY COMPONENTS\nOVERWHELMINGLY. FOR EXAMPLE, ABC/\"WASHINGTON\nPOST\" POLL VIEW TRUMP AS BI BIASED --\n>> MIKE PENCE WAS ON WITH WOLF AND ASKED ABOUT THE KKK, FORMER\nKKK GRAND MASTER DAVID DUKE AND WHETHER HE'S DEPLORABLE.\nSO HE WENT OUT, HE SAID I DISAVOW HIM, WE DON'T WANT HIS\nSUPPORT.

HERE HE IS.\n>> YOU CALL HIM A DEPLORABLE. >> NO, I'M NOT IN THE NAME\nCALLING BUSINESS, WOLF. >> WAS THAT A SMART MOVE?\n>> OF COURSE, DAVID DUKE IS DEPLORABLE.\nOF COURSE HE IS. HE'S A KKK MEMBER.\nI DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW QUESTIONS LIKE THAT DON'T HAVE -- DON'T\nHAVE IMMEDIATE ANSWERS. >> WHY DOESN'T HE JUST SAY, YES,\nOF COURSE, HE IS BUT I DON'T WANT TO CALL NAMES, WE\nDISAVOW -- WHY NOT ANSWER IT THAT WAY?\n>> HE DID SAY IMMEDIATELY, WE'VE RENOUNCED HIS SUPPORT, WE DON'T\nEXPECT -- >> HE DID --\n>> ANYONE WHO WANTS TO, AGAIN, MISCHARACTERIZE MIKE PENCE WHO'S\nA MAN OF UPSTANDING RESILIENT, INCREDIBLE CHARACTER, HE IS NOT\nTHAT -- DAVID DUKE -- DAVID DUKE HAS NO PLACE IN THIS PARTY.\nI'M STILL WAITING ON HILLARY CLINTON TO RENOUNCE THE KKK\nGRAND DRAGON IN CALIFORNIA WHO'S ENDORSED HER.\nI'M WAITING FOR HER TO BE ASKED THOSE SAME QUESTIONS AND\nRENOUNCE THAT SUPPORT.

SUCH AS HE'S HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT\nWHY HE THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO RELEASE HIS TAXES, BUT WHEN\nYOU ASKED HIM WHETHER OR NOT TRUMP SHOULD SUBSCRIBE TO THE\nPENCE STANDARD, HE GAVE A LITTLE LAUGH AND SORT OF BRUSHED THAT\nOFF AND ONCE AGAIN USED THAT COMMENT ABOUT THE AUDIT.\nHE IS DOING THINGS THAT PRESERVE FOR HIMSELF A POLITICAL FUTURE\nWHILE ALSO TRYING TO DEFEND TRUMP.\n>> I ALSO THINK MIKE PENCE IN THAT INTERVIEW SHOWED THE\nDIFFICULTY OF CAPITALIZING ON WHAT HILLARY CLINTON SAID ABOUT\nTHE BASKET OF DEPLORABLES AND HALF OF HIS SUPPORTERS BEING\nTHAT, WHICH IS IN ORDER TO REALLY SAY IF YOU ARE FOR DONALD\nTRUMP THAT WHAT SHE SAID IS TERRIBLE AND THAT SHE'S PAINTING\nHALF OF HIS SUPPORTERS AS RACIST OR ISLAMOPHOBES OR GENOPHOBIC,\nYOU NEED TO DEFEND IN PRETTY STRONG TERMS THAT THE AREA\nTHAT'S DEPLORABLE IS A TINY, WELCOME SLIVER, AND EVEN WITH\nMIKE PENCE, AS HE TRIED TO DO THAT, YOU SAW THAT IT WAS VERY\nDIFFICULT. NOT ONLY THAT A NUMBER OF\nQUESTIONS YOU ASKED HIM, DO YOU AGREE WITH RUDY GIULIANI ON THE\nHEALTH? DO YOU THINK THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON IS HEALTHY? WHAT WILL DONALD TRUMP RELEASE\nWHEN IT COMES TO HIS HEALTH RECORDS?\nHE DIDN'T HAVE VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD ANSWERS FOR YOU,\nAND I THINK THAT IS A PROBLEM WHEN YOU ARE THE RUNNING MATE\nAND THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT YOU REALLY -- I MEAN, WHILE\nHE WAS ABLE TO SKATE AROUND SOME THINGS, HE REALLY COULD NOT\nFULLY BACK UP HIS CANDIDATE ON A NUMBER OF THINGS.\n>> LET'S TAKE THE OTHER SIDE OF IT AS BRIANNA IS SAYING, WHICH\nIS, ON THE CHARITABLE DONATIONS WHICH YOU PUSHED HIM ON GIVEN\nTHE \"WASHINGTON POST\" REPORTING TODAY, HE SAYS HE'S GIVEN TO\nCHARITY. WE DON'T KNOW.\n>> TENS OF MILLIONS. >> WE DON'T KNOW.\nWHY DON'T WE KNOW? BECAUSE HE HASN'T RELEASED HIS\nTAXES. HIS ANSWER ON THE TAXES IS HE'S\nDOING WHAT THE LAW REQUIRES, ALL RIGHT, AND HE'S DISCLOSED ON HIS\nELECTION DOCUMENTS. BUT HE DIDN'T DEFEND HIM -- YOU\nKNOW, WHEN YOU WERE PUSHING HIM, HE CAN'T DEFEND NOT RELEASING\nHIS TAX RETURNS BECAUSE HE HASN'T HAS\nRELEASED HIS OWN TAX RETURNS AS A GOVERNOR, ET CETERA.\nTHOSE QUESTIONS STILL REMAIN OUT THERE, AND WHAT HE DOES IS\nDEFLECTS. HE'S VERY PRACTICED AT\nDEFLECTING. >> ONE THING THAT REALLY STRUCK\nME ON THE ISSUE OF BIRTHER AND DONALD TRUMP LEADING THE EFFORT.\nPEOPLE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT IT. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT, YOU\nKNOW. SO TO GLORIA'S POINT, THAT WHOLE\nINTERVIEW WAS HIM TRYING TO DEFLECT YOU PRESSING HIM, YOU\nPRESSING HIM.

YOU HAVE NO JOBS.\nWHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE?\nIF YOU LOOK AT HIS WIFE, SHE HAD NOTHING TO SAY, SHE PROBABLY\nMAYBE SHE WASN'T ALLOWED TO HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY.\n>> SO THIS AD COMES AS DONALD TRUMP IS HAMMERING CLINTON FOR,\nIN HER REMARKS AT A FUND-RAISER, SAYING HALF OF TRUMP'S\nSUPPORTERS BELONG IN A BASKET OF DEPLORABLES.\nJOINING US, CONGRESSMAN MEEKS OF NEW YORK, DEMOCRAT FROM\nNEW YORK. HE'S CHAIRMAN OF THE\nCONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS AND A HILLARY CLINTON SUPPORTER.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.\n>> GOOD BEING WITH YOU. >> THANK YOU.\nWE KNOW NOW HILLARY CLINTON AFTER SAYING THE BASKET OF\nDEPLORABLES, SHE SAYS SHE REGRETS THE REMARK BUT SHE ONLY\nREGRETS SAYING HALF OF HIS SUPPORTERS SHOULD FIT INTO A\nBASKET OF DEPLORABLES. LISTEN, HEAR, HOW DONALD TRUMP\nIS USING HER REMARK TO HIS ADVANTAGE.\nTHIS IS FROM LAST NIGHT. >> SHE LOOKS DOWN ON THE PEOPLE\nWHO COOK HER MEALS, DRIVE HER CARS AND DIG THE COAL THAT POWER\nHER ELECTRICITY. >> SO NO MATTER WHAT YOU THINK,\nI MEAN, OBVIOUSLY YOU AGREE WITH HILLARY CLINTON.\nDIDN'T HILLARY CLINTON HAND DONALD TRUMP A GIFT WITH HER\nREMARK? WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAID RIGHT\nTHERE, THAT'S A POWERFUL LINE. >> YOU KNOW WHAT, COMMON SENSE\nTELLS YOU BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF, FROM WHAT WAS INDICATED\nON THOSE COMMERCIALS AND WHAT YOU HEARD FROM HIS MOUTH ALL\nALONG, HE IS DEPLORABLE. AND DEPLORABLE INDIVIDUAL, IT'S\nONLY REASONABLE TO BELIEVE, WILL ATTRACT OTHER DEPLORABLE PEOPLE.\nWHEN YOU THINK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, FOR EXAMPLE WHAT HE SAID\nABOUT MEGYN KELLY, BLEEDING OUT OF HER, THAT'S DEPLORABLE.\nWHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE MEXICAN AMERICAN\nJUDGE WHO SAID HE COULDN'T DO HIS JOB SIMPLY BECAUSE HE WAS\nMEXICAN, THAT'S DEPLORABLE. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE FACT HE\nSAID HE WAS GOING TO PAY THE LEGAL FEES OF ONE OF HIS\nSUPPORTERS TO ATTACK SOMEONE AT HIS RALLY, THAT'S DEPLORABLE.\nI COULD GO ON AND ON ABOUT THE THINGS DONALD TRUMP HAS SAID OR\nDONE IS DEPLORABLE. SO THAT INDICATES THAT DONALD\nTRUMP HIMSELF IS DEPLORABLE. AND IT ONLY IS RATIONAL TO\nBELIEVE THAT DEPLORABLES ARE ATTRACTED TO DEPLORABLES.\n>> AGAIN, YOU WERE TALKING MOST NOTICEABLY ABOUT DONALD TRUMP\nRIGHT THERE BUT HILLARY CLINTON WAS TALKING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP\nVOTERS. MIKE PENCE AND DONALD TRUMP AND\nTRUMP'S SUPPORTS SAY, YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT A BASKET FULL OF\nANYTHING, WE'RE AMERICANS. AND SHOULD A CANDIDATE BE\nTALKING, HILLARY CLINTON IN THIS CASE, BE TALKING ABOUT VOTERS\nTHIS WAY? >> WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT, SOME\nAMERICANS UNFORTUNATELY ARE DEPLORABLE.\nI WOULD SAY DAVID DUKE IS DEPLORABLE.\nMR. PENCE SAID HE WOULD NOT PUT HIM IN THAT CATEGORY AS BEING\nDEPLORABLE. THERE ARE SOME AMERICANS BY\nTHEIR ACTIONS AND WHAT THEY DO --\n>> -- DENOUNCED DAVID DUKE, HAS DENOUNCED ASSOCIATION WITH DAVID\nDUKE, AND HE SAID HE JUST WASN'T GOING TO GET IN THE GAME OF\nUSING THE WORD THAT HILLARY CLINTON USED AND WASN'T GOING TO\nVALIDATE IT BY USING THAT REMARK.\n>> THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, IS DAVID DUKE DEPLORABLE?\nTHE ANSWER YES. SHOULD BE YES FOR ANYONE RIGHT\nOFF THEIR MOUTH. NOT TO SAY AS DONALD TRUMP\nATTEMPTED TO DO DURING THE PRIMARY.\nHE CLAIMED HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHO DAVID DUKE WAS.\nWHY? HE WANTED HIS SUPPORT TO HELP\nWIN THE PRIMARY. SO IT IS A DEPLORABLE ACT.\nSO THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH TELLING THE TRUTH IF YOU SEE\nSOMETHING THAT'S DEPLORABLE. DR. KING ONCE SAID IF THERE'S A\nGOOD PEOPLE ARE SILENT ABOUT DEPLORABLE ACTS OF OTHERS, THEN\nYOU CAN FIT IN THAT CATEGORY ALSOS.\n>> YOU THINK SHE SHOULD NOT APOLOGIZE?\n>> I THINK WHAT SHE SAID WAS APPROPRIATE.\nTHERE ARE SOME. AND I MEAN I KNOW SOME\nINDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SUPPORTING TRUMP INTEREST, THEY WON'T GO\nOUT AND STAND UP FOR HIP. THEY'RE NOT, YOU KNOW, VOUCHING\nFOR HIP. THEY'RE SUPPORTING HIM.\nI KNOW THOSE INDIVIDUALS. THERE'S A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS\nTHAT ARE NOT DEPLORABLE WHO ARE SUPPORTING HIM.\nBUT THERE'S NO QUESTIONING THE FACT THAT BECAUSE OF HIS\nDEPLORABLE STATEMENTS AND ACTIONS, HE HAS ATTRACTED A LOT\nOF DEPLORABLE PEOPLE. >> CONGRESSMAN, HILLARY CLINTON\nAT HOME IN CHAPPAQUA RIGHT NOW, RECOVERING FROM PNEUMONIA.\nA FORMER CHAIR OF THE DNC DON FOWLER SAYS THE PARTY COMMITTEE\nSHOULD BE COMING UP WITH CO CONTINGENCY PLANS IN CASE HER\nHEALTH DOESN'T IMPROVE. DO YOU THINK THE PARTY NEEDS TO\nSTART ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE? >> WE ARE JUST FINE.\nHILLARY CLINTON IS THE EQUIVALENT TO A STRONG AND STAR\nATHLETE WHO HAPPENS TO S TO COMN WITH AN INLLNESS.\nTHE DOCTOR HAS ADVISED SHE REST AND SHE'LL BE BACK ON THE FIELD.\nTHIS IS NOTHING SERIOUS, YOU KNOW.\nI TELL FOLKS FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE.\nWHEN I'M ILL, ONCE I KNOW I'M ILL, I TRY TO FIGHT THROUGH\nIT -- >> CONGRESSMAN, YOU SAY IT'S\nNOTHING SERIOUS, HOW DO WE KNOW? HOW DO WE KNOW?\nWE KNOW PNEUMONIA AT THIS POINT. WE'RE TOLD IT'S NOT SERIOUS BY\nHILLARY CLINTON. WE HAVEN'T BEEN TOLD BY A DOCTOR\nTHAT IT'S NOT SERIOUS. WE HAVEN'T BEEN TOLD BY THE\nRECORDS. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF THAT\nKNO PNEUMONIA SHE HAS.\n>> THE DOCTOR MADE THE ANNOUNCEMENT, HE'S BEEN TREATING\nHER. >> YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT.\n>> THE DOCTOR HAS TOLD YOU AND STATED, YOU KNOW, WHAT HE'S\nDOING TO TREAT IT AND SHE'S GOING TO BE OKAY.\nSHE HAS BEEN, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE TALK ABOUT TRANSPASH I.\nI DON'T KNOW OF ANYBODY WHO HAS BEEN -- YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT THAN\nHILLARY CLINTON. THE SAME STANDARD SHOULD BE\nPLACED ON TRP TRUMP. >> CONGRESSMAN, WOULD YOU LIKE\nTO KNOW IF DONALD TRUMP HAD PNEUMONIA?\n>> I'D LIKE TO KNOW HIS HEALTH RECORDS, AT LEAST GIVE THE SAME\nKIND OF INFORMATION THAT HILLARY HAS GIVEN.\nSOME DOCTOR SAYING HE'S GOING TO BE THE HEALTHIEST PRESIDENT OF\nTHE UNITED STATES HISTORY. THAT'S A MEDICAL RECORD?\nWE SHOULD DEMAND MORE. HE WON'T GIVE HIS TAX RUSHES.\n>> WE ARE ASKING THOSE QUESTIONS.\nWE ARE ASKING THOSE QUESTIONS. SAME AS -- WHOEVER HAS\nPNEUMONIA. THEY SHOULD FESS UP AND TELL US.\n>> CONGRESSMAN MEEKS, THANK YOU.",

GOP VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE\nMIKE PENCE ON MONDAY REFUSED TO CALL DUKE DEPLORABLE IN AN\nINTERVIEW WITH CNN'S WOLF BLITZER.\n>> WE DON'T WANT HIS SUPPORT OR THE SUPPORT OF PEOPLE WHO THINK\nLIKE HIM. >> YOU WOULD CALL HIM A\nDEPLORABLE? >> NO.\nI AM NOT IN THE NAME-CALLING BUSINESS, WOLF.\n>> A COMMENT WELCOMED BY WOLF WHO SAID IT'S GOOD TO SEE AN\nINDIVIDUAL LIKE PENCE AND OTHERS START TO REJECT THIS ABSOLUTE\nCONTROLLED MEDIA.

THE CAMPAIGN SAID THEY DO NOT\nWANT HIS SUPPORT OR THE SUPPORT OF PEOPLE WHO THINK LIKE HIM.\nWHY NOT CALL HIM DEPLORABLE? THE CRITICS SAY THAT NOT DOING\nSO MAKES IT LOOK AS THOUGH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS TRYING TO NOT\nOFFEND WHITE SUE PREMACISTS AND NATIONALISTS.\n>> DONALD TRUMP HAS DENOUNCED DAVID DUKE ON A NUMBER OF\nOCCASIONS. ON THE EXACT FIRST DAY THE WORD\nCAME OUT THAT HE WAS SUPPORTING MR. TRUMP.\nI BELIEVE CNN ASKED THE QUESTION AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE AND HE\nSHUT IT DOWN IMMEDIATELY. THE ONLY REASON DAVID DUKE EVEN\nHAS A PLATFORM IS BECAUSE CNN KEEPS TALKING ABOUT IT.\nLET ME AGREE WITH SOMETHING TIM KAINE SAID IN THAT PACKAGE THERE\nABOUT IF YOU IGNORE SOMETHING IT GROWS AND GETS WORSE.\nTHAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. THAT'S EXACTLY WHY WE HAVE ISIS\nTODAY. FOR HILLARY CLINTON TO CALL HALF\nOF THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY DEPLORABLE, THAT'S ABSOLUTELY\nDISQUALIFYING HER. IT WASN'T HALF OF TRUMP'S\nSUPPORTERS. SHE ACTUALLY WENT AFTER ALL OF\nTRUMP'S SUPPORTERS BY SAYING HALF ARE THOSE TERRIBLE NAMES\nRACIST AND SEXIST. SHE HAS ESSENTIALLY CALLED OUT\n100% OF TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS. BUT I WILL SAY THIS IS TYPICAL\nOF THE ELITE POLITICIANS. AND IF YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THEM\nSOMEHOW YOU'RE A DEPLORABLE PERSON AND THAT'S WHAT HILLARY\nCLINTON THINKS OF HALF OF AMERICA.\n>> SHE SAID SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID HALF BUT SAID THERE IS A\nBASKET OF DEPLORABLES THAT SUPPORT TRUMPS.\nPENCE'S INTERVIEW LAST NIGHT EARNED PRAISE FROM WHITE\nSUPREMACISTS. DAVID DUKE SAID IT'S GOOD TO SEE\nPENCE START TO REJECT THIS ABSOLUTE CONTROLLED MEDIA.\nTHE DAILY STORMER, A NEO NA NAUGHTSI WEBSITE SAID TRUMP\nCHOSE A SOLID GUY TO BACK HIM UP.\nDOESN'T IT MAKE YOU UNABLE -- UNCOMFORTABLE TO HEAR PRAISE\nFROM PEOPLE LIKE THAT? >> NO.\nWHAT IS AWFUL IS WHEN THE FATHER OF A TERRORIST SUPPORTS THE\nNOMINEE FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nPEOPLE WHO WANT TO CONTROL IMMIGRATION ARE LABELED RACISTS\nAND BIGOTS. PEOPLE WHO -- I KNOW HILLARY\nCLINTON AND A LOT OF HER FRIENDS DON'T LIVE ON AA BORDER STATE AD\nDON'T HAVE TO LIVE WITH THE IMPACT OF IMMIGRATION LIKE MANY\nOF US DO. TO INSULT THEM BASED ON\nINSINUATION IS ABSURD. WE CAN SAY LOOK AT PEOPLE\nSUPPORTING HILLARY CLINTON. BURNING AMERICAN FLAGS.\nDEFACING PUBLIC PROPERTY. >> NO ONE HAS CALLED PEOPLE WHO\nDON'T WANT ISIS TO MOVE INTO THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD ISLAMAPHOBIC.\nTHAT HAS NEVER HAPPENED IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD?\n>> THAT IS ABSOLUTELY WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT.\nIF YOU SPEAK OUT AGAINST -- >> NO.\nPEOPLE CALL PEOPLE WHO HATE MUSLIMS ISLAMAPHOBIC.\nBUT PEOPLE DON'T SAY THAT ABOUT PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT ISIS TO\nMOVE IN. ACCORDING TO HIS OFFICE\nREPUBLICAN SENATOR MIKE LEE TODAY SPOKE WITH PENCE AND TOLD\nHIM, QUOTE, REPUBLICANS MUST IDENTIFY DAVID DUKE'S RACISM AS\nDEPLORABLE.

RED REPUBLICAN.\nHE THINKS YOUR CANDIDATES AND YOUR CAMPAIGN ARE NOT DOING\nENOUGH TO CONDEMN THESE RACIST VIEWS.\nIS MIKE LEE WRONG? >> HE IS ALSO A NEVER-TRUMPER\nWHO HAS NEVER HAD ANYTHING NICE TO SAY ABOUT MR. TRUMP.\nREALLY, THIS ENTIRE INTERVIEW AND ALL OF THESE INTERVIEWS\nBASED AROUND THIS ONE WORD \"DEPLORABLE\" IS BECAUSE THE\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN WILL NOT USE HILLARY CLINTON'S TERMINOLOGY.\nTHAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE.\nTHE CAMPAIGN HAS DISAVOWED, THE CAMPAIGN MR.

IS DAVID DUKE VILE?\n>> ABSOLUTELY. THAT'S EXACTLY WHY THE CAMPAIGN\nWANTS NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM. WE HAVE SAID THAT A NUMBER OF\nTIMES ON A NUMBER OF NETWORKS.

IT'S EXTRAORDINARY DECISION BY\nHILLARY CLINTON TO DECIDE ON FRIDAY AFTER DIAGNOSIS OF\nPNEUMONIA THAT, THAT DID NOT MEET THE STANDARD OF SOMETHING\nTHE PUBLIC SHOULD KNOW. AS ALWAYS, ON MANY FRONTS IN\nTHIS CAMPAIGN, HER BEST COMPARISON IS WITH DONALD TRUMP,\nWHO'S PROVIDED US WITH LESS INFORMATION BOTH ABOUT HIS\nHEALTH AND MORE EGREGIOUSLY ABOUT HIS TAXES THAN ANY\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE EVER BEFORE.\nWE HAVE TWO OF THE OLDEST CANDIDATES THAT HAVE EVER RUN\nFOR PRESIDENT.

ONE OF THE BIG DEBATES THAT\nTHEY'VE HAD IN THE CAMPAIGN IS WHETHER TO PUT HER DOCTOR ON THE\nPHONE WITH REPORTERS, WHETHER TO PUT OUT ALL OF THE SORT OF\nMEDICAL RECORDS, THE PAGES THAT, YOU KNOW, JOHN McCAIN, JOHN\nKERRY, AL GORE, GEORGE W. BUSH PUT OUT AND SORT OF CREATE, GIVE\nVOTERS A SENSE OF THE PHYSICAL HEALTH OF THE CANDIDATE.\nWHAT THEY'RE COMING BACK AGAINST, I THINK, IS HER DESIRE\nFOR PRIVACY, FOR PUTTING OUT AS LITTLE INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE,\nYOU KNOW, WHICH HAS BEEN A PATTERN OF SECRETARY CLINTON'S\nGOING BACK TO THE '90s. >> ZELENY REPORTED THAT HER OWN\nSTAFF, SOME OF THEM DIDN'T KNOW SHE HAD PNEUMONIA.\n>> DIDN'T KNOW. WE DID A LOOK THIS MORNING,\nGOING BACK AND LOOKING AT THE DECISION MAKING.\nSHE FOUND OUT FRIDAY MORNING SHE HAD THIS DIAGNOSIS OF PNEUMONIA\nAND DECIDED TO KEEP THE INFORMATION TO A REALLY TIGHT\nCIRCLE OF FAMILY MEMBERS, CLOSEST AIDES, PEOPLE WHO FOR\nYEARS AND DECADES IN SOME CASES HAVE KIND OF REINFORCED HER\nINSTINCT FOR PRIVACY, FOR HUNKERING DOWN BECAUSE OF THE\nBELIEF THAT INFORMATION CAN SO EASILY BE MANIPULATED BY\nCONSPIRACY THEORISTS, PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AGAINST HER.\n>> THIS IS ALSO JUST HER PERSONALITY.\nSHE DOESN'T OVERSHARE. SHE DOESN'T SHARE SITUATION\nOTHER PEOPLE WOULD. SHE SAID IN THAT INTERVIEW WITH\nANDERSON, I THOUGHT I WOULD JUST MUSCLE THROUGH IT.\nTHAT'S SORT OF A METAPHOR FOR HOW SHE'S HANDLED A LOT OF\nTHINGS IN LIFE. >> IT WASN'T A BIG DEAL TO HAVE\nANOTHER DEVICE WHEN SHE HAD HER E-MAILS.\nIT WASN'T A BIG DEAL NOT TO TELL PEOPLE SHE HAD PNEUMONIA UNTIL\nTHEY GET CAUGHT, UNTIL THERE BECOMES A COMPELLING REASON FOR\nTHESE THINGS TO BE OUT THERE. THAT'S WHY THERE'S THIS TRUST\nDEFICIT WITH HILLARY CLINTON. THIS WHOLE INCIDENT, ALL THE\nHEALTH CONCERNS ASIDE, JUST MADE PEOPLE REMEMBER THAT AGAIN, WHY\nTHEY MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO TRUST HILLARY CLINTON.\n>> LET'S SWITCH OVER TO TRUMP HERE.\nDO WE HAVE THE SOUND OF TRUMP TALKING ABOUT WHAT CLINTON SAID\nABOUT VOTERS? >> I THINK WE DO.\nLET'S PLAY THAT. >> I ASK YOU BECAUSE YOU KNOW.\n>> SHE CALLED THESE AMERICANS EVERY NAME IN THE BOOK.\nRACIST, SEXIST, XENOPHOBIC, ISLAMOPHOBIC.\nSHE SAID THEY WERE NOT EVEN AMERICAN.\nRIGHT. ANYBODY XENOPHOBIC?\nI DON'T THINK SO. I DON'T THINK SO.\nNEVER IN HISTORY HAS A MAJOR PARTY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SO\nVICIOUSLY DEMONIZED THE AMERICAN VOTER.\n>> RON, EXCEPT FOR HIM. WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?\n>> SOMETIMES IT'S JUST LIKE SOMETHING SCREAMS OUT BS ALERT.\n>> THIS IS WHERE DONALD TRUMP KIND OF CHALLENGES CONVENTIONAL\nJOURNALISM. WHEN YOU SAY SOMETHING THAT IS\nJUST SIMPLY THAT SEPARATED FROM THE FACT, THIS IS A CANDIDATE\nWHO CAME DOWN THE ESCALATOR AND TALKED ABOUT UNDOCUMENTED\nIMMIGRANTS AS RAPISTS, WHO SAID THAT A U.S.-BORN FEDERAL JUDGE\nCOULD NOT DO HIS JOB PRECISELY BECAUSE OF HIS ETHNIC HERITAGE.\nIT IS EXTRAORDINARY FOR HIM TO BE SAYING THAT, YOU KNOW, SHE'S\nTHE UNIQUE LY DEMONIZING LARGE GROUP OF AMERICANS.\n>> XENOPHOBIC IS FEAR OF OUTSIDERS.\n>> IN POLLING, THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT THE DONALD TRUMP\nCOALITION IS MUCH MORE HOSTILE TO THE IMPACT -- HE'S A MUCH\nMORE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF IMMIGRANTS.\nALWAYS A MISTAKE FOR A CANDIDATE TO ATTACK THE MOTIVATIONS OF\nPEOPLE. THERE ARE LOTS OF REASONS WHY\nPEOPLE ARE NOT VOTING FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nIT'S WRONG TO SIMPLY ATTRIBUTE IT TO KIND OF, YOU KNOW, BAD\nMOTIVES. BUT IT IS NOTEWORTHY THAT FOR\nTHIS MODERN DEMOCRATIC COALITION, DIVERSITY, TOLERANCE,\nINCLUSION ARE CORE VALUES. IN THIS DISPUTE, SHE IS\nPORTRAYING HERSELF AS SOMEONE WHO WILL STAND UP FOR THAT.\nIN THE SAME WAY THIS MOTIVATES THE TRUMP COALITION, I THINK IT\nALSO MOTIVATES THE CLINTON COALITION.\n>> THIS IS ALSO THE PLACE WE'RE HOPING TO GET THE TRUMP/PENCE\nTICKET INTO, WHICH WAS NOT FOCUS ON THE HALF THE VOTERS BUT ON\nTHE DEPLORABLES SO THEY HAVE TO END UP DEFENDING OR LOOK LIKE\nTHEY'RE DEFENDING PEOPLE LIKE DAVID DUKE.\nTHIS WAS SORT OF THE IDEA OF LIKE, OKAY, DONALD TRUMP, MIKE\nPENCE STAND UP FOR THE VOTERS WHO ARE SUPPORTING YOU, DEFEND\nWHAT THEY SAY, WHAT THEY DO. >> THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE\nDEMOCRATIC PARTY AND HILLARY CLINTON WANT TO CAST A BIG TENT\nFOR ALL OF THEM, EXCEPT REPUBLICANS, WHO SHE SAYS ARE\nDEPLORABLES. HERE'S MY QUESTION.\nWAS THAT INTENTIONAL, OR DID SHE MISSPEAK?\nTHERE'S A BIG DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER THAT IS THE MESSAGE THAT\nSHE'S TRYING TO SEND OUT TO EVERYONE.\nWE DON'T EVEN WANT THEM. WE DON'T LIKE THEM.\nOR WAS THAT JUST SHE JUST WENT OVERBOARD.\n>> IT SEEMS LIKE SHE DOESN'T WANT PEOPLE TO FEEL LIKE THEY'RE\nASSOCIATED WITH THE DEPLORABLES. SHE DOESN'T WANT PEOPLE TO WANT\nTO BE PART OF THAT CLUB. I WOULD \u00e2\u0096\u00a0ISAGREE THATSHE\nDOESN'T WANT REPUBLICANS. THEY'VE ACTUALLY TRIED TO\nRECRUIT, PARTICULARLY ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS, WHO\nHAVE BEEN RAGING AGAINST TRUMP THIS ENTIRE TIME.\n>> MY POINT IS, IS THAT THE WAY TO DO IT?\nCALL HALF OF DONALD TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS --\n>> NO, BECAUSE THIS COULD AFFECT THE BLUE-COLLAR VOTERS THAT HER\nHUSBAND AND JOE BIDEN HAVE BEEN WORKING SO HARD TO RECRUIT.\nIN PLACES LIKE PENNSYLVANIA, OHIO, IN THE RUST BELT.\nIF THEY HEAR THIS OUT OF CONTEXT, THEY COULD BE LISTENING\nTO TRUMP AND THINKING HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH.\n>> AS JACKIE NOTED, THE FLIPSIDE IS IN REALITY, THEIR SURER PATH\nTO VICTORY IS THROUGH THOSE WHITE-COLLAR SUBURBS.\nI THINK SHE WENT TOO FAR AND PHRASED IT IN A WAY THAT'S\nUNNECESSARILY POLARIZING AND OFFENSIVE TO VOTERS.\nI THINK AS JACKIE WAS SUGGESTING, THEY WANT THOSE\nVOTERS TO QUESTION WHETHER THIS IS A POOL YOU REALLY WANT TOP\nJUMP IN. IS THIS WHERE YOU SEE YOURSELF\nCUL CULTURALLY, OR DO YOU FEEL\nALIENATED FROM IT. AS YOU KNOW IN POLLING, TODAY\nSHE'S AHEAD AMONG COLLEGE EDUCATED WHITE VOTERS, WHICH NO\nDEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HAS EVER WON IN THE\nHISTORY OF POLLING. >> WE ALSO KNOW THE ANSWER TO\nYOUR QUESTION IS, YES, IT WAS INTENTIONAL, BECAUSE SHE HAD\nSAID THIS BEFORE ABOUT THE NATURE AND CHARACTER OF SOME OF\nHIS SUPPORTERS. THE 50% WAS NEW.\nTHAT WAS THE MISTAKE. SHE OVERREACHED.\n>> PANEL, STICK AROUND.",

AND A TRUMP CAMPAIGN OFFICIAL\nTELLS ME THAT DONALD TRUMP WILL KEEP UP THESE ATTACKS ON HILLARY\nCLINTON OVER THIS DEPLORABLE COMMENT.\nTODAY AT HIS EVENT IN IOWA AND LATER TODAY WE WILL SEE THE\nRETURN OF HIS DAUGHTER IVANKA TRUMP.\nSHE'LL BE BACK OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL CAMPAIGNING WITH\nHIM IN PENNSYLVANIA. CHRIS, THIS IS ONE OF HER FIRST\nBIG APPEARANCES SINCE HER CONVENTION SPEECH.\n>> ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nLET'S DISCUSS THESE BIG IDEAS THAT ARE GOING ON IN THE\nCAMPAIGN WITH CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR AND TRUMP SUPPORTER\nKAYLEIGH McNENNE AND CHRISTINE QUINN.\nONE FOR EACH OF YOU. FIRST YOU, CHRISTINE.\nLET'S PUT THAT AXELROD TWEET BACK UP.\nOBVIOUSLY NOT AN ENEMY OF THE CLINTONS.\nHE RAN THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN AGAINST HER IN 2008.\nANTIBIOTICS CAN TAKE CARE OF PNEUMONIA.\nTRUE, DEPENDING WHAT KIND. WHAT'S THE CURE FOR AN UNHEALTHY\nPENSION FOR PRIVACY THAT REPEATEDLY CREATED UNNECESSARY\nPROBLEMS? MY SUGGESTION IS THIS IS NOT\nABOUT HER HEALTH. WE HAVE NO PROOF TO QUESTION HER\nHEALTH IN ANY LEGITIMATE WAY. HOWEVER, WE HAVE A LOT OF PROOF\nTO QUESTION THE NATURE OF TRANSPARENCY WITH THIS CANDIDATE\nAND HER CAMPAIGN. YOU ONLY GET TO KNOW WHAT THEY\nWANT YOU TO KNOW WHEN THEY WANT YOU TO KNOW IT.\nFAIR CRITICISM? >> WELL, I THINK YOU COULD SAY\nTHE FINAL PART OF WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT MOST CANDIDATES OUT THERE,\nRIGHT, THAT THEY TELL US THE INFORMATION.\nI THINK IF ANYBODY HEARD SECRETARY CLINTON LAST NIGHT ON\nANDERSON COOPER, SHE MADE SOME VERY GOOD POINTS.\nSHE DIDN'T THINK THIS WAS A BIG DEAL.\nSHE THOUGHT SHE COULD POWER THROUGH IT.\n>> SAID THE SAME THING ABOUT THE SERVER.\nJUST SAYING, JUST FOR AN ANALOGY.\nYOU KNOW, I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE, I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS THAT\nBIG A DEAL, THE CONTROL OF INFORMATION, THE CONCERN OF\nWHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO HER IF IT GETS OUT FUELS ALMOST A\nPARANOIA. THAT'S THE CRITICISM.\n>> BUT LET ME JUST SAY ONE THING.\nI RESPECT HILLARY CLINTON IN SAYING, I'M GOING TO GO TO THE\n9/11 MEMORIAL, EVEN THOUGH MAYBE THE DOCTORS SAID I SHOULD REST.\nI THINK THAT'S SOMETHING TO BE RESPECTED.\n>> ME TOO. I DID THE INTERVIEW WITH HER ON\nFRIDAY. WE TALKED ABOUT HEALTH.\nWE'RE BOTH ALLERGY SUFFERERS. SHE DIDN'T MENTION PNEUMONIA.\n>> SHE MAY NOT HAVE KNOWN. >> SHE'S GOT A GREAT ENGINE.\nI'M NOT DISPUTING THAT. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE\nTRANSPARENCY. >> I BELIEVE AS SECRETARY\nCLINTON SAID LAST NIGHT, WHETHER IT'S ALL OF THE E-MAILS THAT ARE\nNOW OUT, WHETHER IT'S THE MEDICAL INFORMATION SHE'S PUT\nOUT FROM A DOCTOR WHO HAS ACTUAL PRIVILEGES IN NEW YORK CITY,\nWHICH YOU CANNOT SAY ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S DOCTOR, ALL OF\nTHE TAXES, ALL OF THAT THAT'S OUT THERE IS BEYOND IN SOME\nCASES AN ETHIC STANDARD OF WHAT'S EXPECTED OF A\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. AND YOU CANNOT SAY THAT ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP. JUST TO TELL YOU, WE SEE REPORTS\nIN \"THE WASHINGTON POST\" OF PHANTOM DONATIONS FROM THE TRUMP\nFOUNDATION. >> WE'LL COVER THAT.\nWE HAVE THE WRITER FOR \"THE WASHINGTON POST\" ON SHOW TODAY.\n\"NEW DAY\" HAS BEEN ALL OVER THIS STORY.\nWHAT ARE YOU TAKING EXCEPTION TO?\n>> TO THE FACT SHE SELECTIVELY DISCLOSES WHAT IS IN HER\nINTERESTS. BUT THINGS SHE'S REQUIRED BY LAW\nTO DISCLOSE, THE FEDERAL RECORDS ACT REQUIRES SHE PRESERVES HER\nE-MAILS, HER AIDES TOOK HAMMERS TO THE BLACKBERRIES AND BLEACHED\nTHE SOFTWARE FROM HISTORY. SHE CAN SELECTIVELY DISCLOSE\nTHINGS. SHE'S NOT REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE\nHER MEDICAL RECORDS. WHY DESTROY DOCUMENTS YOU'RE\nREQUIRED BY LAW TO PRESERVE? >> USING THE PHRASE REQUIRED BY\nLAW WOULD IMPLY THAT SOME LAW HAD BEEN BROKEN.\n>> THE FEDERAL RECORDS ACT WAS BROKEN.\n>> WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, AS A LAWYER, THE HEAD OF THE FBI, A\nMAN WHO YOU CANNOT QUESTION HIS RECORD, HAS SAID NO LAW WAS\nBROKEN. >> HOLD ON.\nLET ME PAUSE. JUST FOR YOU AT HOME WHO ARE\nFOLLOWING THIS, YOU'RE IN LAW SCHOOL, YOU'RE A LAWYER.\n>> I'M NOT A LAWYER. >> I'M A LAWYER.\nJUST SO YOU KNOW. THE FEDERAL RECORDS ACT WAS\nARGUABLY VIOLATED BY WHAT SHE DID.\nTHAT IS A STATE DEPARTMENT GUIDELINE THAT THEY WOULD\nENFORCE. SHE WAS OUT OF OFFICE WHEN ALL\nTHIS CAME OUT. SO THEY COULD NOT ENFORCE THAT.\nIT BEING ILLEGAL IS A TERM OF ART THAT WOULD APPLY TO THE\nFEDERAL. THAT'S WHAT THE FBI WAS LOOKING\nAT. THEY FOUND NO BASIS TO PROSECUTE\nTHIS CASE. IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A COME PLEK\nISSUE. >> YES, ABSOLUTELY.\nBUT I WANT TO BE CLEAR. THE DIRECTOR HAS SAID, THE FBI\nDIRECTOR, NO LAWS WERE BROKEN. >> HE CALLED HER EXTREMELY\nCARELESS. >> BEYOND THAT, LOOK AT HIS\nRECORD. WHAT IS NECESSARY FOR\nPRESIDENTIAL DISCLOSURE, WHICH IS A GREAT LITTLE TWIST THERE BY\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, IS NOT THE SAME THING AS A LEGAL STANDARD.\nSINCE RICHARD NIXON, EVERY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HAS\nDISCLOSED THEIR TAXES. I'M NOT SAYING DONALD TRUMP IS\nLEGALLY BOUND TO DO THAT. I'M SAYING HE'S ETHICALLY BOUND\nTO DO THAT. >> LET'S PICK UP THAT PART OF\nTHE BALL. LET'S TAKE THIS IN PIECES.\nWITH THESE TWO CAMPAIGNS, THERE'S A LOT TO TALK ABOUT WHEN\nIT COMES TO TRANSPARENCY. LET'S NOT OVERWHELM THE\nAUDIENCE. FAIR CRITICISM, TRUMP HAS NOT\nGIVEN THE KINDS OF DISCLOSURES WE'RE USED TO SEEING.\nTHE DEFENSE IS, HE'S A PRIVATE CITIZEN.\nI FIND THAT UNSATISFYING. THE FOUNDATION GOING ON RIGHT\nNOW, THE CRITICISM, HE COULD DUMP A TON OF INFORMATION TO\nPROVE WHAT MIKE PENCE IS SAYING. ALL HE HAS TO DO IS RELEASE HIS\nTAXES. CHARITABLE GIVING WOULD BE IN\nTHERE. HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO IT.\nIS HE TO BLAME FOR QUESTIONS OF HIS OWN TRANSPARENCY?\n>> NO, I DON'T THINK SO. HE'S NOT REQUIRED TO RELEASE HIS\nTAXES. IF HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO SO, HE\nDOESN'T HAVE TO. WE KNOW HE'S PAID TAXES WITHIN\nTHE BOUNDS OF LAW. >> HOW DO WE KNOW?\n>> HE SURVIVED NEARLY A DOZEN AUDITS.\n>> WHY ARE THEY AUDITING HIM IF IT'S SUCH A CLEAR QUESTION?\n>> MANY BILLIONAIRES AND MILLIONAIRES ARE AUDITED.\n>> MANY OF THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO CHEAT THE SYSTEM.\n>> DONALD TRUMP HAS SURVIVED NEARLY A DOZEN AUDITS.\nHE'S PAYING TAXES WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF THE LAW.\n>> BY THE WAY, HAVE YOU SEEN PROOF HE'S BEING AUDITED RIGHT\nNOW? >> NO, WE DON'T KNOW THAT, BUT\nWE TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD. >> DO YOU THINK THAT'S ODD?\nSHOW US THE IRS LETTER. >> I CAN PROMISE YOU THIS.\nTHE POLITICIZED IRS WHO WENT AFTER TEA PARTY GROUPS USING THE\nFEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD SOMEHOW FIND A WHAAY TO LET US KNOW.\n>> SHE SAID DONALD TRUMP DISCLOSES WHAT HE WANTS TO.\nHE'S NOT LEGALLY BOUND TO DISCLOSE HIS TAXES.\nSO THE QUESTION POPS INTO MY MIND.\nWHAT IS HE HIDING IF HE DOESN'T DISCLOSE THEM?\nAND WHY DOES HE ONLY TELL US WHAT HE WANTS US TO KNOW AND\nCLAIMS HE'S TRANSPARENT? >> THAT'S THE SAME QUESTION\nPEOPLE HAVE ABOUT YOUR CANDIDATE.\n>> SHE'S DISCLOSED 40 YEARS OF HER TAXES.\n>> BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING SHE WANTED US TO KNOW.\n>> YOU CANNOT SAY DONALD TRUMP IS GIVING EVERYTHING IF YOU THEN\nSAY HE ONLY GIVES WHAT HE WANTS, WHICH IS WHAT IS IN HIS BEST\nINTEREST. LET'S GO TO HIS FOUNDATION.\nTHIS IS AN ENTITY WE DON'T -- WE BELIEVE HE'S GIVEN NO MONEY TO,\nBUT WE DON'T KNOW THAT BECAUSE HE WON'T TELL US, SINCE 2008.\nTHE FOUNDATION GAVE AN ILLEGAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE FLORIDA\nATTORNEY GENERAL WHO THEN STEPPED DOWN ON HER\nINVESTIGATIONS INTO TRUMP UNIVERSITY.\nTHERE ARE NOW REPORTS IN \"THE WASHINGTON POST\" THAT HE USED\nFOUNDATION FUNDS TO BUY ITEMS FOR HIMSELF, WHICH IS ILLEGAL,\nAT BEST. >> WE'RE GOING TO PICK THIS UP\nLATER IN THE SHOW. A QUICK REBUTTAL FROM YOU.\n>> \"WASHINGTON POST,\" THIS IS PROOF OF HORRENDOUS JOURNALISM.\nYOU HAVE THE REPORTER COMING ON. THAT MONEY WENT TO BREAST\nCANCER, WHICH I THINK IS A GREAT CAUSE AN A WORTHY CAUSE FOR A\nFOUNDATION TO DONATE TO. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FIVE\nDISCLOSURES WITHIN HIS FOUNDATION, MANY OF WHICH CAN BE\nPROVEN OFF AS MERELY CLERICAL ERRORS, VERSUS THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION, WHERE SHE MET HALF OF THE DONORS IN NONGOVERNMENT\nMEETINGS. IT WAS A REVOLVING DOOR OF\nCORRUPTION. IF YOU DONATED TO THE\nFOUNDATION, YOU GOT ACCESS TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT.\n>> CORRUPTION IMPLIES THAT WE HAVE PROVEN OR SHOWN PAY FOR\nPLAY. THIS IS ANOTHER SITUATION THAT\nWAS INVESTIGATED BY THE FBI, WHICH IS PART OF THE CLINTON\nDEFENSE. MY GET INVESTIGATED ALL THE TIME\nABOUT STUFF. TRUMP NEVER HAS.\nWHAT IF IT WERE ON HIM? THEY FOUND NO PROOF OF WHAT YOU\nCALL CORRUPTION. CORRUPTION MEANS SOMETHING.\nIT DOESN'T MEAN SMELLS BAD. MEANS IT IS BAD.\n>> SINCE CHRISTINE BRINGS UP THE FBI AND LOVES THE DIRECTOR SO\nMUCH, THE FBI DIRECTOR HAS RECOMMENDED ONE FOUNDATION BE\nINVESTIGATED. THAT'S THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nTHE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DECLINED TO INVESTIGATION.\nTHE FBI RECOMMENDED INVESTIGATION OF THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION. >> WE DON'T KNOW WHO IN THE N\nBI. LET'S GO BACK TO THE SUSAN G.\nKOMEN THING. I DON'T WANT TO THROW AROUND\nBREAST CANCER SURVIVORS AS SOME CLOAK FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nHE WAS TOTALLY ALLOWED TO GIVE FOUNDATION MONEY TO A GOOD\nGROUP, BUT HE DOESN'T GET TO TAKE THE ITEM.\n>> WE DON'T KNOW IF HE HAS THE ITEM.\nHAVE YOU SEEN THE ITEM? >> HE PURCHASED THE ITEM.\nTHIS IS A PATTERN OF ILLEGAL OF WHAT APPEARS TO BE ILLEGAL\nACTION IN THE TRUMP FOUNDATION. YOU CAN'T COVER IT UP.\nTHERE'S NONE OF HIS MONEY THERE SINCE 2008.\nSO HE'S PERFECTLY HAPPY TO GIVE OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY AWAY TO\nCANDIDATES, THE FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL, WHICH IS CLEARLY\nSOMETHING NOT ALLOWED, AND HE WAS FINED FOR THAT\nSIGNIFICANTLY. >> ALL RIGHT.\nON THE FOUNDATION AGAIN, \"NEW DAY\" IS TAKING THIS UP WITH THE\nWRITER FROM \"THE WASHINGTON POST.\"\nWE'LL VET THAT STORY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR MAKING\nTHE CASES FROM THE RESPECTIVE CAMPAIGNS.\nALISYN? >> WELL, HILLARY CLINTON AND\nDONALD TRUMP ARE IN THE FINAL STRETCH OF THE 2016 RACE.\nSO WHAT DO EACH OF THE CAMPAIGNS NEED TO DO TO WIN?\nMICHAEL SMERCONISH HAS SOME FREE ADVICE NEXT.",

PENSACOLA, FLORIDA, 12,500\nPEOPLE, 8, 10,000 PEOPLE WAITING OUTSIDE TO GET IN.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S TAX RECORDS.\nWHEN CAN WE EXPECT TO SEE THEM? >> WHEN HIS LAWYERS AND HIS\nACCOUNTANTS TELL THEM HE SHOULD RELEASE THEM WHEN HE'S NO LONGER\nUNDER AUDIT. HE'S VERY CLEAR.\n>> HAS DONALD TRUMP OR WILL HE RELEASE ANYTHING FROM THE IRS,\nPROVING THAT HE'S UNDER AUDIT? >> I'M SORRY?\n>> WILL DONALD TRUMP RELEASE ANYTHING FROM THE IRS PROVING\nTHAT HE'S UNDER AUDIT? >> ARE YOU CALLING HIM A LIAR?\nWE'RE TAKING HER WORD THAT SHE WAS OVERHEATED, DIDN'T HAVE\nPNEUMONIA. SHE'S GOING TO START TALKING TO\nTHE PRESS AGAIN. SERIOUSLY, WE'RE RUNNING AGAINST\nA CLINTON AND WE'RE GOING TO CHALLENGE SOMEONE'S VORACITY.\n>> THE LEADER OF LINKED-IN IS GOING TO GIVE VETERANS $5\nMILLION IF DONALD TRUMP RELEASES HIS TAX RETURNS.\nTHAT'S A CAUSE CLOSE TO MR. TRUMP'S HEART.\nWILL THIS BE AN IMPETUS FOR HIM DESPITE WE KNOW WHAT HIS LAWYERS\nHAVE SAID. THE IRS SAID HE CAN RELEASE IT.\nTEY WILL NOT PUNISH HIM. LOTS OF TAX ATTORNEYS SAID THEY\nCAN. WILL HE RELEASE IT NOW GIVEN\nTHIS MOTIVATION? >> NO.\nI HOPE THAT THAT MAN THINKS SO MUCH OF THE VETERANS THAT HE\nWOULD GIVE THEM $5 MILLION WHETHER OR NOT MR. TRUMP DEFIES\nTHE ADVICE OF HIS LAWYER AND HIS ACCOUNTANT AND RELEASES HIS\nTAXES. I ALSO WOULD LOVE TO TELL YOU,\nI'VE LOOKED AT CNN POLLING, EVERYBODY'S POLLING, OUR OWN\nPOLLING I CAN'T FIND WHERE THIS IS A BURNING ISSUE TO MOST OF\nTHE AMERICANS. IT GOES BACK TO WHAT HILLARY\nCLINTON SAID. TO BE SO DISMISSIVE OF TENS OF\nMILLIONS OF AMERICANS ALSO MEANS THAT PEOPLE -- PEOPLE AROUND\nHERE AND ELSEWHERE THINK THAT SOMEHOW THE ISSUES THAT ARE\nVEXING AMERICANS ARE NOT ECONOMY, JOBS, TERRORISM, HEALTH\nCARE, IMMIGRATION, EDUCATION. EXACTLY WHAT WE TELL THE CNN\nPOLLSTERS. WHY DON'T WE HAVE A DISCUSSION\nABOUT THAT? WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT TAXES?\nWHAT WILL OUR TAX BURDEN BE UNDER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP?\nHE HAS GIVEN A 4 OR 5 POINT MIDDLE CLASS TAX RELIEF PLAN.\nWE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT TAX REFORM IN PENNSYLVANIA.\nACTUALLY, A VERY EXCITING ASPECT OF IT.\nTHEN HE'LL BE AT THE ECONOMIC -- >> THE ISSUE GOES TO\nTRANSPARENCY. THE ISSUE GOES TO TRANSPARENCY\nAND IF VOTERS CAN BANK ON WHAT THEY ARE VOTING ON AND KNOWING\nYOUR CANDIDATE. FOR INSTANCE, MIKE PENCE, VP\nNOMINEE, SAID YESTERDAY THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS GIVEN AWAY TENS\nOF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO CHARITY, BUT INVESTIGATIONS\nCAN'T FIND HIS PERSONAL MONEY THAT HAS -- IS IN THE TENS OF\nMILLIONS. DO YOU STAND BY THE TENS OF\nMILLIONS NUMBER? >> DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN\nINCREDIBLY GENEROUS OVER THE COURSE OF HIS OWN LIFE?\n>> WITH HIS OWN MONEY WHICH IS HIS MONEY.\n>> NO, THE FOUNDATION'S MONEY ARE OTHER PEOPLE'S.\n>> OKAY. HE'S BEEN INCREDIBLY GENEROUS.\n>> ARE WE GOING TO ACTUALLY QUESTION HILLARY CLINTON AND HER\nHUSBAND MADE ALMOST A QUARTER OF A BILLION AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO\nJUST QUESTION -- AND THAT'S OKAY.\nIT'S OKAY THAT -- >> BUT WHY ISN'T HE A\nBILLIONAIRE. DONALD TRUMP HAS TAUTED IT TOO.\nWHY IS THAT A SHORT COMING? >> EXCUSE ME?\nIT'S NOT A SHORT COMING. I'M A CAPITALIST.\nI WISH SHE WOULD RESPECT THE HARD WORKING MEN AND WOMEN WHO\nSHE THINKS ARE UNEDUCATED RUDES COMING DOWN FROM THE HILLS.\nTHEY NEED TO BE SCHOOLED BY THIS PRECIOUS WOMAN IN NEW YORK AT\nTIPRIANNI WHO ARE LAUGHING AT AMERICANS.\nDO WE REALLY WANT A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO LAUGHS AT\nAMERICANS? I DON'T.\nI FIND IT DISGRACEFUL. I GREW UP AROUND LABOR BORE\nLISTS. I THINK HER INSULTING TENS OF\nMILLIONS OF AMERICANS JUST BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A YALE\nLAW DEGREE LIKE SHE DOES, JUST BECAUSE THEIR HUSBAND DOESN'T\nMAKE A HALF MILLION TO GIVE A SPEECH 45 MINUTES SOMEWHERE,\nJUST BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GIVE MINERAL RIGHTS TO THEIR FRIENDS\nIN FAR AWAY COUNTRIES WHEN THEY ARE SECRETARY OF STATE AND THE\nOTHER PART OF HER COMMENT WAS ALSO OFFENSIVE.\nLET'S TALK ABOUT THE OTHER HALF OF THE HALF, ALISYN SAYING\nPEOPLE ARE DESPERATE FOR CHANGE. BOY, DO I AGREE WITH HER.\nVERY DESPERATE FOR CHANGE. WHO'S BEEN IN CHARGE OF THE\nECONOMY FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS.\n>> PART OF WHY PEOPLE ARE CALLING FOR HIM TO RELEASE HIS\nTAXES SO WE DO KNOW HOW MUCH HE HIMSELF HAS GIVEN TO CHARITY.\nWILL YOU OR THE CAMPAIGN RELEASE EXACTLY WHAT THAT NUMBER IS?\nAND THE REASON I ASK -- >> I DOUBT IT.\n>> WHY WOULD YOU DOUBT IT? >> I DOUBT IT.\nTHIS IS LIKE BADGERING. I DON'T SEE IT AS JOURNALISM, I\nSEE IT AS BADGERING. WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION SO\nMANY DIFFERENT TIMES ON SO MANY DIFFERENT NETWORKS YET WE'RE NOT\nHAVING CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT THE MIDDLE CLASS TAX RELIEF\nWOULD MEAN FOR PEOPLE'S WAGE STAGNATION.\n>> WE DO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AT OTHER TIMES BUT HOW IS IT\nBADGERING TO ASK FOR THE EVIDENCE OF A CLAIM?\nIF MIKE PENCE IS SAYING TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM DONALD\nTRUMP, SHOULDN'T WE SEE THE EVIDENCE?\n>> DID ANYBODY ASK HILLARY CLINTON FOR EVIDENCE THAT SHE\nWAS OVER HEATED AND DEHYDRATED? IS ANYBODY ASKING HER FOR\nEVIDENCE OF WHY SHE THINKS SHE'S SO PRECIOUS AND SPECIAL THAT SHE\nWOULD HAVE THE SECRET SERVICE BREAK PROTOCOL AT GROUND ZERO ON\nSUNDAY, ALISYN, AND TAKE HER TO HER DAUGHTER'S APARTMENT RATHER\nTHAN A HOSPITAL? WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE.\nTHIS NETWORK AND OTHER NETWORKS WHERE PRESUMPTIVELY PROTECTING\nHER -- >> THAT'S NOT FAIR, KELLYANNE.\nANDERSON COOPER GOT THE EXCLUSIVE.\nI DON'T BUY THAT. WE ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS OF THE\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN BUT WHEN YOU'RE HERE REPRESENTING THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN WE ASK THESE QUESTIONS. YOU CAN'T MAKE CLAIMS AND EXPECT\nEVERYONE TO ACCEPT IT. SO THE IDEA THAT --\n>> I THINK DONALD TRUMP'S A VERY GENEROUS MAN.\n>> YES, AND WHAT'S THE EVIDENCE? >> TO HAVE EMPLOYED TENS OF\nTHOUSANDS OF PEOPLE FROM MANY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, BOTH\nGENDERS CERTAINLY, FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE.\nOVER THE YEARS. >> SURE, BUT THAT'S NOT CHARITY.\nEMPLOYMENT IS NOT CHARITY. >> IT'S PRETTY DARN IMPRESSIVE\nAND IT ISN'T THE POLITICAL RESUME THAT HIS OPPONENT HAS.\nI WOULD RESPECTFULLY PLAY. WE LOVE TO PLAY A PARLOR GAME AT\nTRUMP TOWERS. IT TAKES THE AVERAGE CLINTON\nSURROGATE OR CAMPAIGN STAFFER TEN SECONDS OR TEN WORDS TO TALK\nABOUT DONALD TRUMP WHEN YOU ASK THEM A QUESTION ABOUT HILLARY\nCLINTON AND I CAN'T BLAME THEM. IF SHE WERE MY CANDIDATE, I\nWOULDN'T WANT TO TALK MUCH ABOUT HER EITHER.\n>> BUT YOU ARE TALKING A LOT ABOUT HER.\n>> YOU'RE DARN RIGHT. SO AT LEAST WE HEAR ABOUT HER\nTODAY. TRANSPARENCY AND TRUSTWORTHINESS\nARE HER TWO PILLAR PROBLEMS AND SHE DID NOTHING THE WHOLE LAST\nWEEK. I THINK SHE HAD A TERRIBLE WEEK.\nSHE CERTAINLY HAD A TERRIBLE WEEKEND.\nNOT BECAUSE SHE'S SICK. LET ME REPEAT.\nWE'RE GLAD SHE SAID SHE'S FEELING BETTER.\nWE HOPE SHE'S FULLY RECOVERING AND COMES BACK TO THE CAMPAIGN\nTRAIL. WHY THE CONCEALMENT?\nWHAT'S THE BIG DEAL JUST TO SAY, I HAVE PNEUMONIA AND I'M ON\nANTIBIOTICS. WHY DIDN'T SHE TELL HER RUNNING\nMATE. WHAT AN EMBARRASSMENT FOR HIM TO\nCOME OUT. TUESDAY I READ ON THE HILL, SHE\nDOECHT NEED TO APOLOGIZE FOR HER COMMENT.\nIT'S SO ODD THEY CAN'T LET THE RUNNING MATE KNOW WHAT'S GOING\nON. WHY IS THAT?\n>> SHOULD DONALD TRUMP'S RUNNING MATE MIKE PENCE HAVE SAID THAT\nDAVID DUKE IS DEPLORABLE? >> HE SHOULD -- SURE.\nSO THAT -- SO THAT HE DOESN'T GET HEADLINES SAYING MIKE PENCE\nWILL NOT SAY DONALD TRUMP IS DEPLORABLE AND PEOPLE CAN GET\nSATISFIED? CAN PEOPLE PLAY THE ENTIRE CLIP.\nTHANK YOU FOR PLAYING THAT ENTIRE CLIP.\nWE DON'T WANT TO SUPPORT. WE DON'T LIKE WHAT HE STANDS FOR\nOR PEOPLE STAND FOR IN THE KKK. HE HAS ANOTHER POIBL.\nTHERES A CERTAIN OBSESSION ABOUT CONSTANTLY RAISING ISSUES AND\nRAISING PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT PART OF OUR CAMPAIGN THAT WE HAVE\nSAID AND REINCE PRIEBUS, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN\nNATIONAL COMMITTEE HAS SAID, WE DON'T WANT HIS SUPPORT.\nWE DON'T WANT PEOPLE LIKE THAT. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.\nWILL HILLARY CLINTON DISAVOW -- DOES SHE THINK KERMIT GOSSELIN\nIS DEPLORABLE? KILLING BLACK BABIES IN\nPHILADELPHIA. DOES SHE THINK PEOPLE CALLING\nCOPS PIGS IN A BLANKET AND ASKING FOR THEIR DEATH\nDEPLORABLE? I SHOULD DO.\nWE CAN GO NAME AFTER NAME. I'LL SIT HERE BETWEEN NOW AND\nELECTION DAY. WE WON'T GET TO THE TENS OF\nMILLIONS OF PEOPLE HILLARY CLINTON WAS REFERRING TO BY\nCALLING THEM DEPLORABLE. SHE WAS REFERRING TO HARD\nWORKING MEN AND WOMEN. IT WASN'T A GAFFE.\nPLEASE, PRINT JOURNALISTS, STOP CALLING IT A GAFFE.\nSHE WAS READING IT FROM PREPARED REMARKS AS SHE ALWAYS DOES.\n>> KELLYANNE ARE YOU SATISFIED ABOUT THE LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY\nFROM YOUR CANDIDATE? >> I AM REALLY SATISFIED WITH\nIT. I AM SATISFIED THAT HE IS OUT\nTHERE WITH VOTERS EVERY DAY. THEY EXPECT HIM.\nTHEY DESERVE IT. I TRAVEL WITH HIM.\nTHE COUNTY FAIR HE AND GOVERNOR PENCE WERE TOGETHER IN OHIO.\nIT WAS ASTONISHING TO SEE PEOPLE EIGHT AND TEN DEEP AT A COUNTY\nFAIR TO SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, THEY DON'T SAY MAY I HAVE YOUR\nAUTOGRAPH, THEY SAY I LOVE YOU, WILL YOU SAVE MY COUNTRY.\nTHEY SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING THE SACRIFICE OF RUNNING.\nYOU KNOW WHAT I APPRECIATE, I APPRECIATE THAT I'M RUNNING FOR\nA PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WHO'S NOT A POLITICIAN, WHO DID NOT\nNEED TO DO THIS. PEOPLE IN POLITICS RUN FOR FAME,\nFORTUNE, STATUS, HE HAD ALL OF THAT.\nHE HAS ALL OF THAT. IT'S A TREMENDOUS SACRIFICE FOR\nHE AND HIS FAMILY TO DO THAT. THAT'S ONE OF THE UNTOLD\nSTORIES. WHO THINKS THEY'VE EARNED IT,\nDESERF IT, IT'S THEIR TURN. DARN IT, YOU BETTER GET BEHIND\nME. I'M QUALIFIED.\nYOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS A QUALIFICATION?\nINTEGRITY AND TRANSPARENCY. >> YES, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT\nTRANSPARENCY, A LOT THIS MORNING, AND DEMANDING IT FROM\nBOTH CANDIDATES. >> THANK YOU.\n>> THANKS FOR BEING HERE. >> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.\n>> LET'S GET THE OTHER SIDE. JOINING US NOW IS CLINTON\nSUPPORTER AND FORMER NATO SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER GENERAL\nWESLEY CORK. ALWAYS A PLEASURE.\nI DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE MILITARY SPECIFICALLY.\nTHE CAMPAIGN, WE WERE TRYING TO GET THEM ON TO COUNTER WHAT'S\nOUT THERE RIGHT NOW IN THE STATE OF PLAY AND WE GOT YOU SO I'VE\nGOT TO PUT TWO HATS ON YOU THIS MORNING.\nIS THAT OKAY? >> FINE.\nI'M NOT WORKING WITH THE CAMPAIGN ON THESE ISSUES.\n>> RIGHT. >> BUT I'M A VERY ACTIVE\nSUPPORTER OF HILLARY CLINTON. I'VE KNOWN HER FOR YEARS.\nI THINK SHE HAS HIGH INTEGRITY. I THINK SHE'LL BE A GREAT\nPRESIDENT. WE HAVE TO GET HER INTO OFFICE.\n>> KELLYANNE CONWAY USED AN INTERESTING WORD, FURTIVE.\nDO YOU THINK THAT APPLIES TO HILLARY CLINTON?\n>> ABSOLUTELY NOT. EVERY PERSON WHEN YOU GET UP IN\nTHE MORNING, IS THIS GOING TO BE A GOOD DAY, A BAD DAY, HOW DO\nYOU FEEL? WHEN YOU'RE IN A POLITICAL\nCAMPAIGN YOU'RE USUALLY TIRED. MAYBE DONALD TRUMP ISN'T TIRED\nBECAUSE HE'S COMING BACK TO NEW YORK AND TAKING IT EASY EVERY\nNIGHT. THAT'S WHAT WE HEAR.\nBUT HILLARY CLINTON'S WORKED HER REAR END OFF FOR THE LAST YEAR\nAND A HALF ON THIS CAMPAIGN AND I KNOW I DID THIS FOR FIVE\nMONTHS. I KNOW HOW TIRED I WAS AND I\nKNOW SHE'S TIRED. AND SO SHE'S NOT GOING TO GET UP\nEVERY MORNING, GEE, TODAY I FEEL 86% TIRED.\nYESTERDAY I WAS 84% TIRED. AND SHE'S NOT GOING TO SAY THOSE\nTHINGS. SO OF COURSE SHE TRIED TO POWER\nTHROUGH THIS. >> YOU'VE MAINTAINED MILITARY\nDISCIPLINE. YOU'RE IN GREAT SHAPE.\nDON'T YOU THINK THESE CANDIDATES SHOULD BE MORE FORTHCOMING ABOUT\nTHEIR MEDICAL HISTORY GIVEN THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE THE MOST\nPOWERFUL PERSON IN THE WORLD? >> SHE'LL RELEASE HER MEDICAL\nRECORDS, BUT I THINK MR. TRUMP REALLY OUGHT TO BE MORE\nFORTHCOMING ABOUT HIS TAX RETURNS AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY.\nTHIS IS THE BIGGEST ISSUE. BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE PRESIDENT OF\nTHE UNITED STATES THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT YOU TO HAVE ONE\nOVERRIDING INTEREST AND PRIORITY AND THAT'S THE GOOD OF THE\nCOUNTRY. AND WHEN I RAN FOR OFFICE I HAD\nTO GIVE UP ALL MY BOARDS, ALL MY PAID ENGAGEMENTS, EVERYTHING.\nSO THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO PERCEPTION, NO CHANCE OF A\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST. TRUMP'S STILL IN BUSINESS.\nWE KNOW FROM RIDING THE RECORDS A LOT OF THOSE BUSINESSES HAVE\nHAD RUSSIAN MONEY IN THEM APPARENTLY.\nAND MAYBE THE RUSSIANS HAVE LOANED HIM MONEY.\nIF IT'S A LOT OF MONEY, MAYBE IT STAYS UP TO MR. PUTIN.\nWE DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS CONNECTIONS ARE WITH RUSSIA.\nAS SOMEONE WHO SERVED IN THE MILITARY SINCE THE 1960s AND WAS\nTHERE DURING THE COLD WAR, I WAS THE NATO COMMANDER TURNED OUT WE\nHAD A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH RUSSIA DURING THE OPERATION TO\nSTOP ETHNIC CLEANSING IN KOSOVO. WHAT IS THE CONNECTION?\nWHERE ARE MR. TRUMP'S LOYALTIES AND IF HE WANTS TO CLEAR THOSE\nUP, HE NEEDS TO RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS.\n>> HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS HE HAS THE BIGGEST ADVANTAGE IN BEING\nPRESIDENT VERSUS HILLARY CLINTON WHEN IT COMES TO INTEGRITY.\nDO YOU ACCEPT THAT GIVEN THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT\nRIGHT NOW AND ABOUT PUTIN BEING A BETTER LEADER THAN OBAMA.\nDO YOU BELIEVE THAT'S HIM BEING A TRUTH TELLER?\nDO YOU BELIEVE THAT GIVES HIM THE ADVANTAGE OF INTEGRITY?\n>> LET'S LOOK AT MR. PUTIN FIRST, THE FACTS.\nTHIS IS A GUY WHO JAILS HIS OPPONENTS, KEEPS THEM OUT OF\nCONGRESS. PEOPLE GET KILLED.\nMAYBE HE'S WORTH $200 BILLION. HOW DO YOU MAKE $200 BILLION IF\nYOU'RE THE LEADER OF A COUNTRY? SO WHAT KIND OF INTEGRITY IS\nTHAT ON THE PART OF MR. PUTIN. THEN IF YOU'RE THE PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATE, HE'S A GREAT LEADER BUT HE'S CERTAINLY NOT THE KIND\nOF LEADER AMERICA WANTS. YOU BELIEVE HE'S GOT 82% -- IF I\nWERE IN RUSSIA I'D SAY PUTIN WAS A GREAT LEADER, TOO, BECAUSE I\nWOULDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER AND I'D BE AFRAID.\nIT'S ABOUT INTEGRITY. IT'S ALSO ABOUT JUDGMENT AND\nIT'S ABOUT HIDDEN MOTIVES. THAT'S FINE COMING BACK TO THE\nTAX ISSUE. YOU WON'T RELEASE YOUR TAX\nRETURNS, CHRIS, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING\nWHAT ARE THE OTHER POLLS ON YOU? HE SHOULD BE OUT OF HIS\nBUSINESS. MR. TRUMP SHOULD BE SAYING,\nLOOK, I WANT TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nHERE'S MY TAX RETURNS. LOOK AT THEM.\n>> AND THE CRITICISM OF CLINTON ON THE SAME LEVEL OF\nTRANSPARENCY IS WE ONLY KNOW THINGS WHEN CONGRESS\nINVESTIGATES, OTHERWISE THE CAMPAIGN OR HILLARY CLINTON\nHERSELF OR THE CLINTONS TOGETHER WON'T LET YOU KNOW THINGS THAT\nDO SPEAK TO THE INTEGRITY OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN\nLEADERSHIP, I.E.,, AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE SAW WITH THE FOUNDATION.\n>> WAIT A MINUTE WAIT A MINUTE. I'VE BEEN WITH THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION AND THE CLINTON GLOBAL INITIATIVE SINCE IT\nSTARTED. I'VE BEEN TO EVERYONE OF THESE\nMEETINGS, I'VE MET ALL OF THESE PEOPLE.\nIT'S A WONDERFUL GATHERING OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO DO THINGS\nTOGETHER TO CHANGE THE WORLD AND IT'S PUT TENS OF MILLIONS OF\nDOLLARS INTO THINGS LIKE HEALTH CARE AND CHILDREN'S EDUCATION.\n>> AND TREATMENT FOR 2/3 WHO RECEIVE IT.\n>> BILL CLINTON GETS NOTHING FROM TNCHTS THERE ARE DIFFERENT\nARMS TO IT. IF YOU WERE SECRETARY OF STATE\nWOULD YOU HAVE HAD THAT KIND OF CONNECTION ACCEPTING MONEY FROM\nFOREIGN ACTORS THE WAY IT WAS WITH CLINTONS.\n>> HILLARY CLINTON WAS SECRETARY OF STATE, BILL CLINTON WAS\nRUNNING THE FOUNDATION. SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO\nWITH THE FOUNDATION OTHER THAN COMING THERE AT THE CLINTON\nGLOBAL INITIATIVE ONCE OR TWICE OR GIVING A SPEECH.\n>> YOU WOUND UP HAVING THE SAME PEOPLE IN BOTH PLACES, RIGHT?\n>> THOSE PEOPLE WERE NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS AND THEY WEREN'T DOING\nBUSINESS WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE COME IN AND TALK TO PEOPLE IN THE STATE\nDEPARTMENT. THAT AP STORY YOU'RE REFERRING\nTO, CHRIS, EVERYBODY WHO'S LOOKED AT THAT STORY SAID THE\nHEADLINES WERE -- >> THEY OVER REACHED.\n>> THEY PULLED IT BACK. >> ABSOLUTELY.\nIT DOESN'T MEAN THE QUESTIONS DON'T EXIST, THAT'S WHY I'M\nASKING YOU, GENERAL. ALSO, THE IDEA OF --\n>> I THINK THE ANSWER TO THOSE QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN OUT THERE.\nTHEY'VE BEEN SET ASIDE. I MEAN, IT'S TIME TO MOVE PAST\nTHOSE QUESTIONS. I WANT TO GET BACK TO THE REAL\nISSUES OF THE CAMPAIGN. AS AN AMERICAN I WANT TO KNOW\nWHAT THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY LOOKS LIKE AND WHAT WE'VE HAD\nFROM MR. TRUMP IS NOT A REAL COHERENT VIEW OF FOREIGN POLICY\nAND THE ECONOMIC PROGRAM, THEY JUST DON'T MAKE SENSE.\nHE TALKS ABOUT TAX CUTS. LET'S TALK ABOUT TAX CUTS.\nWHEN KENNEDY CUT TAXES IN 19 -- IN THE EARLY 1960s, THE TOP\nMARGINAL TAX RATE WAS 91%. HE CUT IT TO 70.\nTHAT'S A LOT DIFFERENT THAN WE ARE TODAY.\nWE'RE ALREADY RUNNING A BUDGET DEFICIT.\nWE'VE GOT OUR MILITARY THAT THE MONEY IS SEE QUESTERED IN THERE.\nTHE MILITARY NEEDS MORE FUNDS. YOU CAN'T KEEP CUTTING TAXES,\nDON'T WORRY, IT'S MAGIC. THE ECONOMY WILL GROW.\nWHY IS MR. TRUMP REPEATING THE SAME OLD TIRED FORMULA THAT\nWE'VE DISPROVED TIME AND AGAIN. IT DOESN'T WORK.\nWHEN YOU TAKE THESE BIG TAX CUTS LIKE PRESIDENT GEORGE W BUSH DID\nIN 2003 AND SAY, THIS IS YOUR MONEY, I'M GIVING IT BACK TO\nYOU, DON'T WORRY, YOUR ECONOMY WILL OUT GROW IT.\nYOU'LL GET MORE TAX RETURNS. NICE THEORY.\nDOESN'T WORK. DISPROVED BY ALL THE FACTS.\nLET'S MOVE FORWARD, ASK THE CANDIDATES THEIR REAL PLANS.\nI THINK HILLARY HAS A REAL PLAN. THE INVESTMENT AND\nINFRASTRUCTURE IS WHAT THIS COUNTRY REALLY NEEDS.\n>> BOTH CANDIDATES HAVE PLANS FOR THAT, THE QUESTION IS WHICH\nONE CAN GET IT DONE. THAT IS A CERTAINLY LEGITIMATE\nBASIS OF APPRAISAL. CHARACTER COUNTS, GENERAL CLARK,\nTHANK YOU FOR MAKING THE CAMPAIGN FOR THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN THIS MORNING.",

THAT SAID, SHE SAID IT COULD BE\nA GOOD TIME TO WEED OUT THE BAD STOCK PICKERS.\nLET'S LISTEN TO ONE PENSION FUND MANAGER, ASHFELD WILLIAMS, FROM\nFLORIDA, TALKING ABOUT THIS VERY POINT AND HOW EXPECTATIONS FROM\nA NUMBER OF YEARS AGO NOW NEED TO BE LOWERED.\n>> IN 1995, YOU COULD HAVE A PORTFOLIO FOR AN INSTITUTION\nTHAT WAS FIXED INCOME, A RISK AVERSE ASSET CLASS AND MILWAUKEE\nA 7.5% RETURN BOGEY WITHOUT TOO MUCH TROUBLE.\nTHOSE DAYS ARE OVER. NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES POSE A\nHUGE HEAD WIND FOR INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE TO MEET LONG-TERM\nLIABILITY COMMITMENTS AND MEET THEM TIMELY.\n>> SO WHAT IS WORKING FOR PEOPLE RIGHT NOW?\nWELL, NOT THE TRADITIONAL PLAYBOOK ACCORDING TO SOME OF\nTHE PARTICIPANTS WE HEARD FROM TODAY.\nSOME OF THE MOVES THAT USED TO WORK BUT NOW CARRY OVERLY HIGH\nRISKS, USING TOO MUCH LEVERAGE OR PERHAPS USING LEVERAGE AT\nALL. BUYING G-7 GOVERNMENT BONDS,\nPAUL SAYS TO SELL ALL THE BONDS BECAUSE THEY'RE NO LONGER A SAFE\nHAVEN. AND BUYING STOCKS, JIM CRAMER\nMADE ALMOST WHAT WAS A JOKE ABOUT HOW THE PARTICIPANTS WE\nHEARD FROM ALL MORNING UP THROUGH THE BEST IDEAS PANEL AT\nLEAST WERE PRETTY MUCH AVERSE TO STOCKS AND TALKING WITH OTHER\nIDEAS OR REALLY JUST STICKING TO THE MACRO PICTURE.\nINTERESTING POINTS ON LEVERAGE, I THOUGHT.\nWE HEARD FROM AQUANTITY WHIZ THAT SARAH EISNER INTERVIEWED,\nLET'S LISTEN TO MARK CARHART. >> RETURNS ARE LOWER.\nDON'T EXPECT LEVERING UP THE PORTFOLIO AND TAKING AS MUCH\nRISK AS YOU USED TO. THE TIME WILL COME IN THE FUTURE\nWHERE THERE WILL BE MORE RETURN OPPORTUNITIES, BUT TODAY, THIS\nIS NOT AN OPPORTUNITY WHERE YOU SHOULD BE TAKING THE SAME RISK\nYOU'VE BEEN TAKING. >> NOW WHAT IS THE POSITIVE TAKE\nAWAY HERE? THE U.S. IS STILL RELATIVELY\nATTRACTIVE, CERTAINLY RELATIVE TO EUROPE, RELATIVE TO JAPAN,\nAND IT IS A STABLE PLACE WHERE IT IS EASIER TO RAISE CAPITAL\nAND THERE WILL BE LONGER TERM GROWTH ALBEIT AT A LOWER RATE.\nTHAT'S THE CONSENSUS VIEW IF THERE IS ANY.\nTHE OTHER THING I HEARD ON THIS PANEL TODAY, THOUGH, SERIES OF\nPANELS, IS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT POLITICS.\nNOBODY WANTED TO WADE TOO DEEP LAY INTO IT.\nPAUL SINGER MAKING A VEILED COMMENT ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S\nHEALTH AND EVEN DONALD TRUMP'S HEALTH.\nVERY VEILED, I SHOULD SAY. HIS INTENT WAS CLEAR.\nRAY DALIO, AND TIM GEITHNER, DID NOT DISAGREE, SAID THERE IS A\nSCARINESS TO WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH OUR POLITICAL RHETORIC\nTODAY, THE POPULISM, BECAUSE OF ITS EXTREMIST BENT.\nI THOUGHT THOSE WERE INTERESTING WORDS MELISSA AND BRIAN COMING\nFROM SOMEONE LIKE HIM WHO REALLY TAKES A VERY MACRO VIEW AND\nGEOPOLITICS, OF COURSE, HERE AND ABROAD ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE\nPART OF THAT. >> DID YOU HEAR, MELISSA, THE\nCOMMENTS THAT SINGER MADE ON THE HEALTH ISSUE?\nWHEN THEY SAID, HE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT -- SOMEBODY\nASKED ABOUT POLITICS, NOT GOING TO GET INTO POLITICS, BUT IF\nBOTH CANDIDATES ARE STILL ON THE STAGE, BEFORE THE ELECTION.\n>> THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S MORE OR LESS WHAT HE\nSAID. AND THAT WAS THE COMMENT.\nSO YOU HAVE TO WONDER IF HE'S ALLUDING TO HILLARY CLINTON'S\nALMOST FAINTING SPELL. I'M SURE HE WAS.\nIN TERMS OF DONALD TRUMP, NO SPECIFIC HEALTH CONCERNS THERE\nTHAT WE KNOW ABOUT, THOUGH WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GET MORE DETAILS AS\nA RESULT OF THE PHYSICAL HE PURPORTEDLY GOT LAST WEEK, THIS\nWEEK. SO HOPEFULLY AND CLINTON TOO IS\nGOING TO REVEAL MORE. WE KNOW MORE ABOUT BOTH OF THEIR\nHEALTH. ANYWAY, THAT'S A DIVERSION FROM\nDELIVERING ALPHA. I BRING THAT UP TO SAY, THIS\nSORT OF NEAR TERM UNCERTAINTY HERE, THE FEAR THAT WE HAVE AN\nEXTREME POPULIST RHETORIC IS ACTUALLY FACTORING IN TO\nPEOPLE'S MARKET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOKS.\n>> RIGHT. BACK TO SELLING G-7 BONDS, WHAT\nI THOUGHT WAS INTERESTING IS THIS NOTION THAT YOU WOULD SELL\nTHOSE BONDS AND BE LONG EQUITIES BECAUSE I MEAN, I -- THE\nCORRELATIONS ARE PRETTY TIGHT. WE SEE BOND SELL-OFFS, WE SEE\nSTOCK SELL-OFFS, SO TO THINK THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE\nCORRELATED WHEN THAT TIME COMES IS AN INTERESTING NOTION.\n>> WELL, IN FAIRNESS, I WONDER IF WE'RE THINKING ABOUT TWO\nDIFFERENT THINGS HERE. SO BILL MILLER SAID -- HAD A\nTRADE, HE SAID YOU SHOULD GO LONG THE S&P AND PAUL SINGER\nLIKES GOLD FOR A NUMBER OF VERY LONG-TERM REASONS, HE SAID\nESSENTIALLY IT IS THE ONE THING THAT HAS MAINTAINED ITS VALUE\nOVER CENTURIES OF HUMAN COMMERCE AND HE THINKS IT IS\nUNDERREPRESENTED IN PEOPLE'S PORTFOLIOS.\nHE SAID, SELL G-7 BONDS, THEY'RE NOT A SAFE HAVEN.\nTHAT'S MY ONE PIECE OF INVESTMENT ADVICE.\nI DIDN'T HEAR THE GO LONG STOCKS PART.\nIN THEIR PORTFOLIO, THEY HAVE ANY NUMBER OF MAJOR STOCK\nREVISIONS. >> KATE, THANK YOU.\nKATE KELLY WITH THE LATEST FROM",

I HAVE BEEN DO YOU FEEL FOREVER\nABOUT SEPTEMBER, AND I THINK THE MARKETS ARE STILL DOUBTFUL.\nYOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S STILL AROUND 20% OR SO PROBABILITY,\nBUT THAT HAVING BEEN SAID, THE FED LOOKS ALMOST DETERMINED TO\nGO IN DECEMBER, AND THAT'S CONCERNING SOME PEOPLE.\nYOU CAN SEE THAT THE YIELDS ARE CREEPING UP.\nTHE TEN-YEAR IS UP ABOVE 1.7. THIS IS A LITTLE BIT TRYING.\nSECONDARILY OIL IS ALREADY UNDER PRESSURE AFTER THE CLOSE.\nWE'RE GOING TO GET THE API INVENTORY NUMBER.\nTHE FEELING LAST WEEK THAT THE BIG DRAWDOWN THAT WE SAW WAS\nBASED ON HURRICANE HERMINE AND THAT TANKERS WERE AFRAID TO\nOFFLOAD UNTIL AFTER THE STORM HAD PASSED, WHICH MEANT THAT\nWITHOUT NEW SUPPLY WE DREW DOWN AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF LAND-BASED\nINVENTORY.

I WOULD KEEP MY EYE ON THE YIELD\nAND SEE IF THAT'S GOING TO CAUSE FURTHER PRESSURE.\n>> FINALLY, WHEN DALIA REITERATES HIS LONG-TERM OPINION\nON THE DEBT CYCLE, ARE YOU CONVINCED?\n>> HE IS AN ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT MAN, BUT I'M NOT AS CONVINCED\nTHAT IT'S -- WHAT DID HE CALL IT -- A BEAUTIFUL DELEVERAGING.\nDOESN'T LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL TO ME.

THAT WAS FUN.\n>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. >> IT WAS GLOOMY I THINK IS A\nWORD WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT LATELY, THIS IDEA OF SLOW\nGROWTH, ZERO TO NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES AND SORT OF\nCRISIS SHOCKS LIKE EURO DECK CRISIS TO BREXIT.\nHOW DO YOU VIEW THE WORLD THROUGH YOUR LENS RIGHT NOW?\n>> THERE'S JUST NOT AS MANY OPPORTUNITIES.\nTHAT'S THE REALITY. I WISH I COULD CREATE THEM FOR\nTHE WORLD BUT THERE JUST AREN'T. OUR QUANTITATIVE LENS, IT TRIES\nTO VALUE ASSETS USING A LONG-TERM VIEW OF CASH FLOWS AND\nGROWTH. RELATIVE TO EXPECTATIONS.\nAND WHAT WE SEE TODAY IS THAT THERE JUST ISN'T AS MUCH\nOPPORTUNITY IN THE TRADITIONAL ASSET CLASSES.\n>> BECAUSE OF VALUATION. >> PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF\nVALUATIONS. WE HAVE THE TOP DECILE.\nYOU HAVE INTEREST RATES AT ALMOST ALL-TIME LOWS OVER A\nLONGER PERIOD. >> ONE OF YOUR POINTS THAT YOU\nMADE ON THE STAGE WAS THAT WHOLE 60/40 MODEL, STOCKS AND BONDS,\nTHROW IT OUT THE WINDOW. WHAT DO YOU REPLACE IT WITH?\n>> I WISH THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE THAT WAS JUST AS GOOD OR I\nCOULD TELL YOU WAS AWESOME. 60/40 WILL STILL BE PART OF\nPEOPLE'S PORTFOLIOS. THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH DO YOU\nWANT TO HAVE IN THOSE TRADITIONAL ASSET CLASSES?\nTHEY'RE AVAILABLE IN UNLIMITED QUANTITIES.\nYOU CAN INVEST IN SIZE AND EQUITIES.\nWHEN YOU PULL THAT BACK, WHAT CAN YOU DO?\nYOU CAN INVEST IN ALTERNATIVES LIKE TREND FOLLOWING.\nTREND FOLLOWING IS A STRATEGY WHERE YOU TRADE FUTURES AND\nCURRENCIES, BUYING THINGS THAT ARE GOING UP IN PRICE AND\nSELLING THINGS GOING DOWN IN PRICE, BOTH DIRECTIONS.\n>> SOUNDS LIKE MOMENTUM INVESTING TO ME.\n>> MOMENTUM INVESTING IT IS. THIS IS ONE APPLICATION OF IT IN\nMACRO MARKETS. THERE ARE OTHER TYPES OF\nINVESTING WE CALL RISK FACTOR INVESTS.\nIT'S THIS IDEA THAT YOU TRY TO BUY SECURITY, BUY AND SELL\nSECURITIES WHICH ARE EXPOSED TO SOME SORT OF A RISK.\nUNCERTAINTY, LIQUIDITY, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.\nAND OVER TIME YOU BUILD -- YOU GET A RETURN, A RISK PREMIUM.\nNO DIFFERENT THAN INSURANCE COMPANY GETS PAID FOR INSURING\nYOU AGAINST LOSS OF YOUR HOUSE. >> WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF THAT\nRIGHT NOW? >> ONE FACTOR WE PARTICULARLY\nLIKE TODAY IS EMERGING CURRENCY CARE.\nWHAT THAT MEANS IS LONG POSITIONS IN THE HIGHEST\nYIELDING CURRENCIES WITHIN EMERGING MARKETS LIKE THE\nTURKISH LIRA, THE INDIAN RAPEA. >> THE FED MAY BE ON THE BRINK\nOF RAISING INTEREST RATES AGAIN. WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME\nTO EMERGING MARKETS. THEY GOT CRUSHED.\n>> THAT'S CORRECT. THAT'S WHY YOU WANT TO BUILD A\nFACTOR PORTFOLIO WHICH TRIES TO HEDGE OUT THAT KIND OF RISK.\nTHAT'S WHY WHAT I'M PROPOSING IS LONG ON SOME EMERGING MARKETS,\nLONG ON OTHER EMERGING MARKETS. WHEN THERE'S A SELL-OFF JOINTLY,\nIT'S NOT HIT BY THAT SAME SORT OF RISK FACTOR.\nIT'S A DIFFERENT DIMENSION. I'M TRYING TO CAPTURE THE\nRELATIVE VALUE IN INTEREST RATES ACROSS EMERGING MARKETS.\n>> I WANT TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING.\nI WAS NOT ON THE PANEL. YOU'RE A QUANTITATIVE DRIVEN\nFUND. YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF Ph.D.s\nCREATING ALGORITHMS BASED ON THE IDEAS YOU HAVE.\n>> CORRECT. >> 'ROBOTS.\n>> AND ROBOTS. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AT SOME\nPOINT, CONCEIVABLY PUTTING YOU OUT OF BUSINESS.\n>> SOMEBODY HAS TO PROGRAM THE ROBOT.\n>> RIGHT. >> I THINK QUANTITATIVE\nINVESTING AT ITS CORE IS SIMPLE. IT'S TAKING THE SAME SORT OF\nINFORMATION HUMANS USE TO MAKE DECISIONS BUT REMOVING SORT OF\nBEHAVIORAL BIASES AND EMOTION FROM THE DECISION.\nAND USING THE POWER OF COMPUTERS AND DATA TO FIND RELATIONSHIPS\nTHAT AREN'T MAYBE PARENT TO THE NAKED EYE AND FINALLY, TO BE\nABLE TO REACT TO THAT REAL TIME ACROSS AN INFINITE NUMBER OF\nMARKETS. THERE'S NO REASON WHY YOU CAN'T\nUSE A QUANTITATIVE MODEL 24 HOURS A DAY ACROSS ANY PIECE OF\nINFORMATION THAT'S AVAILABLE. THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT.\nIT'S NOT THAT IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY BETTER.\nIT'S A DIFFERENT APPROACH. >> IT'S BEEN VERY POPULAR\nPOST-FINANCIAL CRISIS. IT'S ATTRACTED A LOT OF MONEY.\nHAS THAT PEAKED AT ALL? WHAT ARE YOU SEEING IN THE FLOW?\n>> FLOW FALLS PERFORMANCE. BECAUSE A LOT OF QUANTITATIVE\nSTRATEGIES HAVE DONE WELL, A LOT OF INFLOWS, THE AREAS WHERE\nWE'VE SEEN THE BEST PERFORMANCE HAVE BEEN QUANTITATIVE EQUITY\nRISK FACTORS. SOMETIMES PEOPLE REFER TO IT AS\nSMART DATA. IT'S TILTS WITHIN STOCKS TOWARDS\nVALUE STOCKS, MOMENTUM STOCKS, QUALITY STOCKS, PROFITABLE\nSTOCKS. AND THE RESULT OF THAT HAS BEEN\nFIRST A TAIL WIND, WHICH HAS HELPED PERFORMANCE THROUGH THE\nBEGINNING OF THIS YEAR, THE PRIOR TWO YEARS, THE REALIZED\nRETURNS HAD BEEN WELL ABOVE LONG-TERM AVERAGES.\nAND THIS YEAR, BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH MONEY COMING IN AND\nHAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY COMING OUT AROUND JANUARY,\nTHERE'S SOME SELL-OFFS DELEVERAGING A BIG HEDGE FUND,\nTHEY'VE SEEN ACTUALLY PRETTY SUBSTANTIALLY POOR PERFORMANCE\nBECAUSE SO MUCH MONEY HAS COME IN.\nWE DON'T SEE THAT MUCH CROWDING IN OTHER MARKETS.\nPARTICULARLY IN QUANTITATIVE EQUITY MARKETS THERE'S A LOT OF\nCROWDING. >> THE DOW IS DOWN ALMOST 200\nPOINTS. DO YOU SEE THIS MOVE HAVING\nMOMENTUM TO THE DOWN SIDE? >> OUR MODELS, WE HAVE VERY\nSHORT-TERM MODELS THAT LOOK AT SHORT-TERM MOVES.\nIN GENERAL WHEN YOU SEE A SHARP CORRECTION, A SHARP MOVE LIKE\nTHIS, THEY TEND TO REBOUND. IT OFTEN CAN TAKE TWO OR THREE\nDAYS, THOUGH. A ONE-DAY MOVE MAY NOT BE\nENOUGH. I'D HAVE TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT\nSEE WHAT THE MODELS ARE SAYING RIGHT NOW TO GIVE YOU A FORMAL\nANSWER TO THAT QUESTION. >> THANK YOU FOR JOINING US HERE\nAND ON STAGE AT DELIVERING ALPHA AS WELL.\nMARK CARHART FROM KEPOS CAPITAL.

SIXTH ANNUAL DELIVERING ALPHA\nCONFERENCE TODAY IN NEW YORK CITY.\nCARL ICAHN TO RAY DALIO ARE SHARING THEIR IDEAS RIGHT HERE.\nWITH US FOR THE HOUR JOE TERRA NOVA, JOSH BROWN, AND STEVEN\nWEISS. MARKETS, AS YOU KNOW, ARE HAVING\nA VERY DIFFICULT DAY. THE DOW HAS BEEN DOWN ABOUT 250\nPOINTS. DOW AND THE S&P LOOKING AT THEIR\nFOUR OUT OF FIVE DOWN DAYS NOW. THERE'S THE DOW DOWN CURRENTLY\n246. THE S&P AND THE NASDAQ AND THE\nRUSSELL, WHICH IS DOWN 2% TAKING A LITTLE BIT HARDER TODAY.\nGIVE YOU A CHECK ON OIL AND GOLD AND BONDS TOO.\nTHERE'S SO MUCH CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT THE FED MAY DO.\nEVEN HERE AT DELIVERING ALPHA HAVE YOU HEARD FROM SOME OF THE\nLARGEST AND MOST RESPECTED MONEY MANAGERS IN THE WORLD WITH THEIR\nCOMMENTARY ON THE FED AND THE MARKETS.\nWE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT. ALSO WORD TODAY THAT ATLANTA FED\nPRESIDENT DENNIS LOCKHART IS STEPPING DOWN FROM HIS POST IN\nFEBRUARY. THAT IS BIG NEWS.\nTHAT'S WHY WE HAVE SENIOR ECONOMICS REPORTER STEVE LIESMAN\nJOINING US ON SET AS WELL. LET'S DISCUSS WHAT'S TAKING\nPLACE IN THE MARKET. IT'S BEEN AN INTERESTING FEW\nDAYS. JOSH, VOLATILITY IS BACK, AND IT\nIS BACK IN A BIG WAY. >> NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.\nYOU HAD THESE GIANT BULLISH CANDLES EVERYWHERE YESTERDAY.\nWE HAD ERASED ALL OF THE LOSS, AND IN SOME AREAS WE WERE\nACTUALLY GAINING FROM THURSDAY NIGHT'S CLOSE.\nWHEN YOU SEE THAT KIND OF ACTION AND THEN THE NEXT DAY IT'S\nCOMPLETELY NEGATED AS THOUGH IT NEVER HAPPENED, THAT TELLS YOU\nSOMETHING BIG IS GOING ON. WE LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF THESE\nKINDS OF MINUS ONE, PLUS ONE, MINUS ONE AGAIN DAYS NEAR\nALL-TIME HIGHS. THIS HAS ONLY HAPPENED FIVE\nTIMES. I DON'T KNOW 100% WHAT IT MEANS,\nBUT WHEN YOU SEE THE TLT LOOKING AWFUL BACK INTO THE POST-BREXIT\nGAP, AND YOU SEE VAN GARDE REAL ESTATE DOWN 8.5% FROM THE HIGHS,\nYOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS AS A RATE-RELATED ADJUSTMENT BECAUSE\nTHE CUES, THE GROWTH STOCKS, ARE HANGING IN MUCH BETTER THAN THE\nYIELD PROXIES. >> IT MEANS BUCKLE UP.\nI MEAN, INVESTORS, JOE, NEED TO BUCKLE THEIR SEAT BELTS, PUT\nTHEIR SHOULDER STRAP ON. I MEAN, MAYBE IF YOU ARE A RACE\nCAR DRIVER, YOU NEED TO HARNESS IN TOO BECAUSE IT COULD GET EVEN\nMORE VOLATILE FROM HERE. >> I DESCRIBED YESTERDAY AS A\nTRADING EVENT, AND WE'VE NOW GRAVITATED TOWARDS IF YOU ARE A\nMONEY MANAGER, YOU NEED TO BE PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT'S GOING\nON TODAY. IF YOU DID NOT LIKE FRIDAY, YOU\nDO NOT LIKE TODAY. I THINK THE PROBLEM WAS WAKING\nUP THIS MORNING AT 4:30 AND LOOKING AT THE ASIAN MARKETS AND\nSEEING THEM REALLY GIVE UP THE STRONG GAMES.\nTHERE WAS NO REBOUNDS OVERSEAS. PEOPLE REALLY DON'T WANT\nEQUITIES UNLESS THEY'RE DOMESTICALLY FOCUSED.\nTHAT'S WHERE I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A PROBLEM GOING FORWARD.\nWE'RE IN A VACUUM PERIOD. THE RIGHT STRATEGY IS TO RAISE\nCASH LEVELS RIGHT NOW. YOU TAKE YOUR EQUITY HOLDINGS\nBACK. PROBABLY SOMEWHERE AROUND 20% IN\nCASH. YOU HAVE TO CLEARLY PAY\nATTENTION TODAY. AS I SAID YESTERDAY, IT WAS A\nTRADING EVENT. I THINK I MIGHT BE WRONG ABOUT\nTHAT. I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING BIGGER\nTHAT'S DEVELOPING HERE. BILL MILLER WAS ON THE STAGE\nLESS THAN FIVE MINUTES AGO SAYING THAT HIS BEST IDEA RIGHT\nNOW IS LONG THE S&P 500 AND SHORT TREASURIES.\nYET, YOU'VE HEARD OTHER OPINIONS FROM THE LIKES OF PAUL SINGER\nAND RAY DALIO PERHAPS. WE'LL HEAR FROM THEM IN A\nMOMENT. YOUR THOUGHTS FIRST.\n>> THAT WAS SURPRISING. JOSH AND I WERE BOTH STANDING\nTHERE WATCHING BILL MILLER, AND I THINK HE WERE WITH BOTH\nSURPRISED THAT THAT WAS HIS BEST IDEA TO COME OUT.\nNOT THE OTHER SIDE. NOT THE SELL BONDS SIDE, BUT THE\nS&P SIDE. I THINK WHAT PAUL SINGER CAME\nOUT AND SAID WAS MUCH MORE TYPICAL OF WHAT I HAVE HEARD IN\nMY CONVERSATION AND OTHER CONFERENCES I HAVE BEEN AT,\nWHICH IS HIS BEST IDEA WAS TAKE RISK OFF.\nSELL G-7 LONG DURATION BONDS. I'VE DONE WHAT JOE HAS\nSUGGESTED, WHICH I MENTIONED YESTERDAY.\nI'VE TAKEN CAPITAL OFF. ONE OF MY CONCERNS HAS BEEN\nCOMPLACE ENSY IN THE MARKETS, AND I THINK WE'RE SEEING THAT\nCOMPLACE ENSY COME OUT AGAIN TODAY.\nIF YOU HAD ASKED ME YESTERDAY AFTER BRAINERD CAME OUT AND\nTRIED TO THROW COLD WATER ON IT, I WONDER IF YELLIN PUT HIM UP ON\nIT OR NOT, I HAVE TAKEN DOWN MY ODDS OF A TIGHTENING LATER THIS\nMONTH. I STILL THINK IT WILL HAPPEN.\nI WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE MARKET WOULD HAVE HAD SOME\nFOLLOW-THROUGH TODAY. HOWEVER, WE'RE BACK TO THE\nCORRELATION WITH CRUDE. CRUDE SELLS OFF MEANINGFULLY\nOVER 3%, AND THE MARKET TAKES A DIVE.\nI THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO POINT TO.\nTHE OTHER THING -- I THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT -- IS THAT YOU\nCAN'T DISASSOCIATE POLITICS AND THE POLLS GETTING TIGHTER AND\nHILLARY NOW BECOMING -- YOU KNOW, THE PNEUMONIA WITH WHAT'S\nHAPPENING IN THE MARKETS. IT'S BECOMING MORE OF A REALITY.\nI THINK THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO DRIVE THE VOLATILITY AND\nCONTINUE TO DRIVE IT THROUGH ELECTIONS.\n>> WE'VE REFERENCED PAUL SINGER A COUPLE OF TIMES NOW.\nWE MIGHT AS WELL LISTEN TO THE SOUND THAT HE HAD TODAY.\nOF COURSE, THE FAMED HEDGE FUND MANAGER HAD ALREADY SAID THAT\nWE'RE IN THE MIDST OF THE BIGGEST BOND BUBBLE IN HISTORY,\nBUT HERE'S WHAT HE SAID ABOUT HOW HE VIEWS THE WORLD RIGHT\nNOW, AND A DANGEROUS ONE AT THAT.\n>> WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IS CREATED A TREMENDOUS INCREASE IN\nHIDDEN RISK. A RISK THAT INVESTORS DON'T\nEXACTLY KNOW OR HAVE FACED ABOUT THEIR HOLDINGS, AND I THINK IT'S\nA VERY DANGEROUS TIME IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND GLOBAL\nFINANCIAL MARKETS. >> THAT'S PAUL SINGER RIGHT\nTHERE. I GOT STEVE LIESMAN NEXT TO ME\nTOO. THEY BEING IN PART, THE FED.\nNOT JUST THE FED, BUT CENTRAL BANKS AROUND THE WORLD.\nTHE ACTIONS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE, IT'S JUST A DANGEROUS\nTIME RIGHT NOW GIVEN THE THREAT OF PULLING THAT AWAY.\n>> TREASURIES ARE NOT THE RISK-FREE ASSET, AND THAT\nCREATES -- >> SAFE HAVENS AREN'T SUCH.\n>> THERE'S NO SAFE IN THE HAVEN THERE OR NO HAVEN IN THE SAFE.\nIT CREATES A GROUNDLESS INVESTMENT MATRIX IN THAT ALL\nINVESTMENTS ARE JUDGED FROM THE RISK-FREE RETURN.\nIT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO KNOW IF STOCKS ARE OVER OR UNDER VALUED\nRELATIVE TO WHAT COULD BE A VERY POTENTIALLY VOLATILE MOVEMENT IN\nLONG BONDS WHEN IT COMES TO THE YIELD.\nWHAT TROUBLES ME, THOUGH, IS I THINK SINGER IS A LITTLE BIT\nMORE PESSIMISTIC THAN HE OUGHT TO BE IN THAT I THINK THAT MORE\nOR LESS, THE RETURNS ON THE TEN-YEAR ARE AT LEAST TO A 70 OR\n80% DEGREE DETERMINED BY THE MARKET.\nIF THE FED WERE TO STOP REALLY TRYING TO KEEP INTEREST RATES\nDOWN, I DON'T THINK THEY WOULD SKYROCKET TO 3%.\n>> ONE OF THE POINTS THAT HE MADE WAS THAT YOU COULD HAVE\nBOTH STOCKS AND BONDS FALLING TOGETHER, AND THAT WOULD BE A\nREVERSAL OF WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON NOW WHERE STOCKS AND BONDS HAVE\nGONE UP. >> AND THEN THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT\nCENTRAL BANK POLICIES HAVE DONE. IT HAS MADE A MONEY MANAGER VERY\nUNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE YOU ARE TAKING CORRELATIONS BACK TO\nWHERE EVERYTHING IS CLOSE TO ONE.\nEVERYTHING GOES UP TOGETHER. EVERYTHING GOES DOWN TOGETHER\nLIKE IT IS TODAY. THAT'S THE PROBLEM LOOKING\nFORWARD BECAUSE YOU LOSE THE HEDGING OPTIONS.\nIT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON TODAY IN\nOIL AND THINK ABOUT LAST WEEK. WHERE WE ARE ON THURSDAY WITH\nTHE NUMBER THEY CAME OUT AND EVERYONE SAYING, OH, LOOK AT\nOIL. THE BIGGEST DRAWDOWN SINCE 1999,\nGOING THROUGH 50. EVERYONE POSITIONED THE WRONG\nWAY. BRINGING IN THE CORRELATION TO\nONE. >> I ALWAYS PUZZLE OVER IT, ASK\nAPPROXIMATE PEOPLE SAY, OH, THEY GET IT.\nTO ME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE GREED TRADE AND THE FEAR TRADE\nARE SIMULTANEOUSLY OVERVALUED. YOU HAVE A TON OF PEOPLE WHO\nHAVE PILED INTO BONDS IN PART BECAUSE THEY'RE SCARED OF\nSTOCKS, THEY'RE SCARED OF THE FUTURE.\nTHEY'RE LOOKING FOR A RISK-FREE ASSET.\nAS A RESULT, THEY'VE CREATED A NON-RISK-FREE ASSET, AND VERY\nFEW PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO GO WITH THE STOCKS.\n>> I DON'T KNOW IF I AGREE IT'S A NONRISK-FREE ASSET.\nWHEN PEOPLE USE THE BLANKET TERM TREASURIES, WHAT ARE WE TALKING\nABOUT? T-BILLS ARE ACTING AS A RISK-OFF\nRIGHT NOW. THEY'RE DOING THEIR JOB.\nIF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 20-YEAR PLUS, NO, YOU SHOULDN'T EXPECT\nTHAT TO BE THE RISK-FREE IF, IN FACT, LONG-TERM BOND YIELDS ARE\nAT THE FOCAL POINT OF WHAT PEOPLE ARE PANICKING OVER.\n>> LET'S MAKE IT ACTIONABLE THEN.\nIF YOU CAN'T INVEST IN STOCKS BECAUSE THEY LOOK EXPENSIVE AND\nTHEY COULD GO DOWN IF THE FED HIKES AND YOU MAY NOT WANT TO\nINVEST IN BONDS BECAUSE YOU ARE AFRAID THAT THEY GO DOWN AND\nRATES COULD GO UP IF THE FED HIKES, WHAT DO YOU DO?\n>> YOU ENDURE -- LISTEN, YOU ENDURE SOME DEGREE OF SHORT-TERM\nVOLATILITY. IT'S THE ONLY ANSWER.\nTHE OTHER ANSWER IS YOU TRY TO MARKET TIME WITHIN AN ENTIRE\nPORTFOLIO, WHICH YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO.\n>> ONE OF THE THINGS YOU CAN DO IS YOU COULD PLAY FOR VOLATILITY\nTO INCREASE, BUT, AGAIN, THE THING THAT IS MAKING EVERYONE\nUNCOMFORTABLE RIGHT NOW IS AS A MONEY MANAGER, HOW DO YOU LAY\nOFF YOUR RISK? THAT'S THE FIRST MANDATE YOU\nHAVE WHEN YOU ARE MANAGING MONEY.\nYOU ANALYZE YOUR RISK. HOW DO I LAY OFF MY RISK?\nTHAT'S THE CHALLENGE FOR YOU RIGHT NOW BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DO\nIT USING THE HISTORICAL ASSET CLASSES.\nYOU CAN'T DO IT LAYING OFF ON THE CURRENCY MARKET OR LAYING IT\nOFF IN TREASURIES. YOU CAN LOOK AT VOLATILITY RIGHT\nNOW. >> IT ALSO DEPENDS WHAT YOUR\nBASIS IS, TAX BASIS IS. YOU CAN'T GO TO CASH IF YOU HAVE\nA LOW TAX BASIS AND PAY TAXES. FOR NEW CAPITAL, I COULD WAIT\nFOR -- >> I WANT TO REPRESENT BECAUSE\nWHAT SCOTT LEFT OUT OF HIS EQUATION THERE, WHICH HAS TO BE\nPART OF THE CONVERSATION IS YOU CAN'T GO INTO STOCKS BECAUSE --\nYOU ALSO CAN'T BE IN CASH. YOU LOST ALL OF THE RETURN.\nLET ME EXPLAIN. THIS IS IMPORTANT.\nFOR EIGHT OR NINE YEARS IF YOU HAD THIS PESSIMISTIC VIEW ON HOW\nIT WAS ALL GOING TO END UP WITH THE FED, YOU LOST A LOT OF\nMONEY. YOU ARE WELL BEHIND THE CURVE\nBECAUSE OF THAT REAL FEAR THAT YOU HAD, AND I THINK THAT\nREMAINS AN ISSUE. >> THIS CONVERSATION IS NOT\nABOUT SHOULD YOU GO INTO EQUITIES.\nIT'S IF YOU ARE IN EQUITIES, WHAT DO YOU DO NOW?\nMOST OF OUR VIEWERS AND MOST OF THOSE HERE TODAY, THEY'RE FULLY\nINVESTED IN EQUITIES THEY'VE BEEN ENJOYING THIS SEVEN-YEAR\nRIDE HIGHER. WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THAT?\n>> THERE ARE THOSE -- ON THAT POINT I WAS GOING TO SAY PEOPLE\nLIKE CARL ICAHN AND THIS WHOLE NOTION OF TINA.\nTHERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE. HIS THING IS THAT'S MALARKEY.\nYOU COULD BE IN CASH. BEING IN CASH IN A LOW RATE\nENVIRONMENT IS BETTER THAN LOSING IN EQUITY.\nIF THE MARKET IS GOING TO HAVE AN ASYMMETRIC DISLOCATION, THEN\nBEING IN CASH IS OKAY. >> THE MAJORITY OF INVESTORS\nALREADY AGREE TO THAT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT FLOWS, WHEN YOU\nLOOK AT WHERE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES, FINANCIAL\nADVISORS, PLANNERS, WHERE ARE THEY ALLOCATING, THEY'RE NOT\nTHROWING MONEY AT THE SPY. THEY'RE IN VARIOUS STRATA OF\nBOND PRODUCTS. PRIME FUNDS, SHORT-TERM\nTREASURIES, ET CETERA. NOBODY THINKS NOW IS THE TIME TO\nBE 100% STOCKS. >> THERE'S NO SIZE FITS ALL.\nIT DEPENDS ON YOUR AGE, YOUR RISK TOLERANCE, YOUR VOLATILITY\nTOLERANCE. >> LET ME GET TO THE OTHER NEWS\nOF THE DAY, AS IF IT'S AN AFTERTHOUGHT, WHICH IT'S NOT,\nAND THAT'S DENNIS LOCKHART. >> THIS IS A PROFOUND\nCONVERSATION. THIS REALLY GETS AT THE HEART OF\nTHE QUANDRY OF INVESTMENT. PART OF BEING A D.A. HERE --\n>> LOCKHART IS LEAVING IN FEBRUARY.\n>> LOCKHART IS LEAVING IN FEBRUARY.\nHE IS A CENTRIST ON THE BOARD. ONE OF THE FEW NON-ECONOMISTS\nOUT THERE. THERE'S NO TIMETABLE TO APPOINT\nHIM. WE'RE GOING TO LEARN A LITTLE\nBIT MORE ABOUT THE PROCESS IN OCTOBER.\nI GUESS IT'S A COUPLE OF WEEKS FROM NOW.\nLOCKHART HAS BEEN AT THE FED SINCE 2007.\nHE IS A GUY I HAVE KNOWN FOR A VERY LONG TIME.\nA GUY WHO YOU FOLLOW WHEN YOU WANT TO KNOW IF IT'S A CLOSE\nDECISION.",

AT ONE POINT A FEW MOMENTS AGO\nON THE S&P 500, THERE WERE 16 -- THAT'S ONE SIX -- COMPONENTS IN\nTHE GREEN. OIL, BY THE WAY, DOWN 3%, TOO.\n>> OIL AND FOCUS YET AGAIN. WE JUST DIPPED BELOW 30 A\nBARREL. IEA FORECAST WAS NOT WHAT\nINVESTORS WERE HOPING FOR. WE'LL SEE HOW THE OPEC LEADERS\nAND ALL THEIR JOB EARNING OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS CAN\nDIRECTIONALLY MOVE THE MARKET. 45 BUCKS, THOUGH, IS WHAT A LOT\nOF PRODUCERS, BETWEEN 45 AND 50, A SWEET SPOT FOR WHETHER THEY'RE\nACTUALLY ABLE TO MAKE MONEY. >> JIM'S POINT, OF COURSE, IN\nTHE 9:00 AM SHOW, AS YOU ENTER THIS BLACKOUT WINDOW LEADING UP\nTO THE FED MEETING, OIL DOES REALLY DRIVE THE NARRATIVE.\nAND THAT RESULTED IN YESTERDAY'S RALLY.\nWE CERTAINLY DO NOT HAVE BRAINARD SPEAKING TODAY.\nDAVID IS BACK WITH A LOT MORE ON A BUSY DAY.\nHEY, DAVID. >> HEY, CARL, THAT'S RIGHT.\nBREAK GOING ON HERE. YOU CAN HEAR THE SOUND BEHIND\nME. STOCKS IN THE RED AS OIL PRICES\nCONTINUE TO SLIDE, CAUSING THE DOW, S&P AS WELL DOWN WELL OVER\n1%. FED OFFICIALS REMAINING DIVIDED\nAHEAD OF THE NEXT POLICY MEETING THAT STARTS NEXT TUESDAY.\nWHAT AREA SHOULD INVESTORS BE FOCUSING THEIR ATTENTION ON?\nDAWN FITZPATRICK, GLOBAL HEAD OF AT ASSET MANAGEMENT AND MOST 21\nPOWERFUL WOMEN IN FINANCE. THAT'S OKAY, TOO.\nLOT OF GUYS AND LADIES SHOWING UP SAYING WHY THEY CAN'T DELIVER\nALPHA. DOES THAT CONTINUE?\n>> THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE ALPHA IN THE MARKETS.\nI THINK WHAT WE'VE SEEN OF LATE IS THAT ALPHAS ARE DOMINATED BY\nTHE MACRO. CERTAIN HEDGE FUND STRATEGIES WE\nSAW CROWDING. INVESTOR MONEY RETURNS AND MOST\nHEDGE FUND STRATEGIES ARE RELATIVE VALUE.\nYOU GET AN EXCESS RETURN, FLOOD OF MONEY AND THE RETURN GOES\nAWAY AND THE MONEY LEAVES AND THEN THE RETURNS COME BACK.\n>> PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PREDICTING THE DEMISE OF THE HEDGE FUND\nINDUSTRY FOR SOME TIME. THAT HASN'T HAPPENED.\nASSETS HAVE ACTUALLY MOVED IN. THIS YEAR, CERTAINLY ANOTHER ONE\nWHERE ACTIVELY MANAGED HEDGE FUNDS, CERTAINLY THE LONG/SHORT\nVARIETY ARE UNDERPERFORMING THEIR BENCHMARKS AND WELL SO.\nIS THERE EVER GOING TO BE SOME SORT OF A TIPPING POINT WHERE\nFEES COME UNDER SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE AND ASSETS REALLY DO\nSTART TO MOVE OUT OF THIS AREA AS SOME OF THE INSTITUTIONS AND\nOTHERS WHO INVEST IN HEDGE FUNDS SAY WHAT ARE WE DOING?\n>> I DO THINK HEDGE FUND FEES WILL COME DOWN.\nINVESTORS ARE GETTING A LOT SMARTER ABOUT DECOMPOSING ALPHA\nAND BETA. IN OTHER WORDS, THE MAJORITY OF\nHEDGE FUNDS ARE TYPICAL EQUITY LONG HEDGE FUNDS WHERE THE\nUNDERPERFORMANCE HAS BEEN THE MOST PRONOUNCED.\nWHAT INVESTORS ARE STARTING TO DO, THEY CAN BUY BETA FOR A\nCOUPLE OF BASIS POINTS. THEY WANT TO PAY FOR THE EXCESS\nRETURN. SO I THINK THAT KIND OF\nDELINEATION WILL PUT FEE PRESSURE ON THE INDUSTRY.\nBUT I'M REALLY IN THE CAMP THAT THE HEDGE FUND INDUSTRY TWO\nYEARS FROM NOW WILL BE LARGER, NOT SMALLER.\n>> WHY? >> BECAUSE IT'S REALLY\nIMPORTANT. IF DONE RIGHT, IT'S A REALLY\nIMPORTANT DIVERSIFIER IN THE CONTEXT OF AN OVERALL PORTFOLIO.\nAGAIN, THE OTHER THING YOU'LL START TO SEE IS DIVERGENCE OF\nRETURNS ACROSS TRADITIONAL ASSET CLASSES.\nHAVING SOMEONE WHO CAN ACTIVELY ALLOCATE AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF\nOPPORTUNITIES, I THINK, IS GOING TO ADD VALUE AND BE REALLY\nIMPORTANT ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE RETURN TARGETS OF, YOU\nKNOW, 7% TO 8%. >> DOES IT SAY SOMETHING ABOUT\nYOUR VIEW ON THE OVERALL MACRO AND MARKET ENVIRONMENT, THAT YOU\nEXPECT HEDGE FUNDS TO GROW THE NEXT FEW YEARS IN TERMS OF WHAT\nYOUR EXPECTATIONS ARE FOR RETURNS AND VARIOUS ASSET\nCLASSES? >> YEAH.\nI THINK RETURNS ARE GOING TO BE CHALLENGED ACROSS ASSET CLASSES\nAND OVERALL RETURN EXPECTATIONS, ABSOLUTELY, ARE GOING TO COME\nDOWN. YOU KNOW, AGAIN, THAT SAID I DO\nTHINK THERE ARE GOING TO BE POCKETS OF GREAT OPPORTUNITIES\nIN THE HEDGE FUND SPACE RIGHT NOW.\nONE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES I THINK IS REALLY ATTRACTIVE IS MERGR\nARBITRAGE. >> NO KIDDING.\nWHY IS THAT? >> CLASSIC SUPPLY AND DEMAND\nBALANCE. ACTIVITY DOWN A LITTLE BIT FROM\nLAST YEAR BUT THE NUMBER OF DEALS OVER $10 MILLION IS\nACTUALLY UP 50% FROM THE LAST CYCLE AND LARGEST TRADITIONAL\nPLAYERS AND MERGER SPREADS WERE THE INVESTMENT BANKPRIEARY\nTRADING DESKS. YOU HAVE MICROSOFT, LINKED IN,\nAND THAT'S BEEN OVER 10% ANNUALIZED.\n$26 BILLION DEAL. IF THAT WAS A $2 BILLION DEAL,\nTHE SPREAD WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER.\nSO, PLACES LIKE THAT ARE REALLY INTERESTING.\n>> ONE OF MY MERNLER FRIENDS ARE HAPPY TO HEAR THAT, HOPING THAT\nWILL BE THE CASE. IT'S NOT BEEN WITHOUT ITS\nPITFALLS. IN TERMS OF THE RISK, AS YOU\nWELL KNOW, DAWN, THE NUMBER OF DEALS THAT WAS NOT EXPECTED YOU\nHAVE TO PICK THE RIGHT MANAGER. DON'T YOU?\n>> IT'S A SHORT TAIL STRATEGY. YOU CAN STEP ON A LAND MINE.\nTHE KEY IS HAVING A SMART MANAGER AND HAVING A DIVERSIFIED\nPORTFOLIO. >> BEYOND DEALS, DAWN WHAT IS\nYOUR OUTLOOK ON THE CURRENT POLITICAL RISK THAT MANY PEOPLE\nHERE AGREE IS ELEVATED, ESPECIALLY HERE IN THE UNITED\nSTATES, HEADING INTO THE ELECTION?\nTHIS MARKET, WHICH IS BEING SORT OF JERKED AROUND BY VARIOUS FED\nSPEAKERS INTO A VERY IMPORTANT MEETING NEXT WEEK.\n>> IT'S BEEN REALLY INTERESTING TO ME.\nIT FEELS LIKE THE MARKETS ARE VERY CENTRAL BANK FIXATED AND\nNOT PAYING ENOUGH ATTENTION TO THE POLITICAL ANGLE THAT YOU'RE\nTALKING ABOUT WITH THE U.S. ELECTIONS, WITH REFERENDUM IN\nITALY. AND I THINK THAT'S GOING TO\nDRIVE MORE OF THE MARKET VOLATILITY GOING FORWARD.\nAND I THINK WHAT WE'VE SEEN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS IN MARKETS,\nTHERE'S A LOT OF DEBATE GOING ON IN TERMS OF THE DIMINISHING\nRETURNS FROM CENTRAL BANK POLICY AND ALSO KIND OF THE FORTITUDE\nOF THE BANKS TO STAY THE COURSE. >> THANK YOU FOR RUSHING OVER\nHERE FROM THE PANEL. APPRECIATE IT.\n>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> DAWN FITZPATRICK, HEAD OF\nGLOBAL EQUIIES AND MANAGEMENT. LOT HERE TO COME FROM DELIVERING\nALPHA. I'M OFF TO A PANEL.\nWE'LL BE TALKING TO THE EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF ALIBABA.\nRIGHT NOW OVER TO CARL AND THE GANG AT NYSE.\nCARL? >> THANK YOU.\nGOOD MORNING, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO A SPECIAL EDITION OF\n\"SQUAWK ALLEY.\" I'M CARL QUINTANILLA.\nOBVIOUSLY AN IMPORTANT DAY, BIG DAY.\nCNBC, INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR HOSTING THE SIXTH ANNUAL\nDELIVERING ALPHA CONFERENCE IN NEW YORK CITY, BRINGING HEDGE\nFUND TITANS AND INVESTORS TOGETHER, OFFERING THEIR VIEWS\nON POLICY, THE ECONOMY, POLITICS AND INVESTING.\nIN JUST A FEW MOMENTS WE'LL HEAR FROM ELLIOTT MANAGEMENT'S PAUL\nSINGER. THAT'S A BIG ONE.\nFIRST, BRIDGE WATER ASSOCIATES MAKING NEWS A MOMENT AGO,\nTALKING ABOUT RATES ALONG WITH FORMER SECRETARY TIM GEITNER.\nTAKE A LISTEN. >> WHEN JAMIE DIMON SAYS TO\nRAISE INTEREST RATES YOU THINK THAT'S WRONG?\n>> THAT'S RIGHT. I THINK THAT'S WRONG.\nAT THIS STAGE, THE RISKS ARE SO  THERE'S NO DOUBT YOU CAN SLOW\nTHE ECONOMY, WORLD ECONOMY, U.S. ECONOMY.\nLOOK AT THE INFLATION PRESSURES, IT'S A HORRIBLE THING.\nYOU LOOK AT THE DEMOGRAPHICS. ALL OF THOSE THINGS MEANS THAT\nTHE RISKS ARE SO MUCH MORE ON THE DOWNSIDE.\n>> WITH ALL OF THAT SEEMINGLY APPROPRIATE, WE DO HAVE A\nSELLOFF TODAY, DOW DOWN 212, PRETTY MUCH SESSION LOWS.\nS&P IS DOWN ALMOST 30 POINTS WITH HORRIBLE BREDTH ALL MORNING\nLONG.  YOU HAVE TO SELL OFF, RIGHT?\nIN THIS BLACKOUT WINDOW BEFORE THE FED.\nMOOD DELIVERING ALPHA HAS CHALLENGED.\nWE HAVE THESE MEDIAN INCOME NUMBERS FOR 2015.\nARE WE TOO SKEPTICAL OR TOO BULLISH ON THE OVERALL\nENVIRONMENT RIGHT NOW, JAN? >> I THINK WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN\nEDGING A LITTLE TOO BULLISH. THAT'S PROBABLY THE REASON\nMARKETS ARE STRUGGLING IN THE NEAR TERM.\nWE GOT TO A POINT WHERE 57% OF ADVISERS WERE SUGGESTING THEY\nWERE BULLISH ON THE OUTLOOK. THAT'S PEAKISH LEVELS.\nLONGER TERM THERE'S STILL A VERY HEALTHY DEGREE OF SKEPTICISM,\nRIGHT? SHORT-TERM MOVES, WE GET REALLY\nBULLISH. WE GOT UP TO NEW HIGHS IN JULY,\nBUT LONGER TERM IT'S REALLY HARD TO GET A VERY STRONG LONG BULL\nCASE IN THE FACE OF TREMENDOUSLY SLOW ECONOMIC GROWTH AND A FED\nTHAT IS INCHING TOWARD TIGHTER POLICY AND A LACK OF BELIEF THAT\nOTHER CENTRAL BANKS CAN REALLY CONTINUE TO ACCOMMODATE TO\nINFLATE MULTIPLES. >> WHEN YOU SAY IT'S HARD TO\nFIND A LONG BULL CASE, YOU MEAN LONG THE MARKET OR LONG TERM?\n>> LONG TERM. >> IF SO HOW LONG TERM?\n>> LONGER TERM. WE'RE SO MANY YEARS INTO THIS\nCYCLE, RIGHT? THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY HAS GONE\nON SINCE 2010. THE MARKET HAS BEEN RECOVERING\nSINCE 2009. YOU GET LONG IN THE TOOTH.\nINVESTORS START TO GET NERVOUS. AT THE SAME TIME, MONETARY\nPOLICY GETTING TIGHTER, INVESTORS ARE A BIT NERVOUS.\nWE'RE ULTIMATELY GOING TO FALL INTO RECESSION THE NEXT THREE TO\nFIVE YEARS. AND HOW DO YOU POSITION FOR\nTHAT? WE'VE ALREADY SEEN SUCH A\nLONG-TERM BULL MARKET. HOW DO YOU CONTINUE TO ADOPT\nTHAT LONGER-TERM TREND? THAT'S WHAT'S CREATING THIS SORT\nOF SKEPTICISM. >> COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO\nLOOK AT THAT, THOUGH. ONE THING IS TO SAY THINGS\nOVERALL ARE GOING TO GET WORSE. YOU KNOW, THE CONSUMER ISN'T\nFEELING THESE NUMBERS THAT WE SEE FROM 2015 THAT SUGGEST, YOU\nKNOW, INCOME UP 5.2%. PRETTY GOOD.\nANOTHER WAY TO LOOK AT IT, THE CONSUMER IS GOING TO FEEL IT\nSOON. THERE'S ALL THIS PESSIMISM\nAROUND THE ELECTION CYCLE. POLITICIANS ARE TRYING TO DRUM\nTHIS UP. REALLY THINGS AREN'T THAT BAD\nAND IT'S GOING TO SHOW UP LATER. WHICH WAY DO YOU LEAN?\n>> CASH STORY IS SO IMPORTANT. TOO MANY INVESTORS ARE HOLDING\nCASH AND THE FED ISN'T MAKING IT EASY ON ANYONE.\nFRIDAY THERE ARE RISKS TO WAITING TOO LONG AND THE NEXT\nTRADING DAY, THERE ARE RISKS TO GOING TOO SOON.\nTHAT'S THE SAME THING, RIGHT? THAT'S NOT MAKING IT EASY.\nFOR US, GOVERNMENT YIELDS ARE PROBABLY TOO LOW.\nCREDIT STILL LOOKS OKAY. AND FOR FOLKS THAT WERE TEASED\nINTO THE FACT THAT VALUE STOCKS MAY BE SAFE, THAT'S THE RICHEST\nPART OF THE MARKET, RIGHT? THAT'S THE MARKET WE'RE TELLING\nFOLKS TO HAVE SOME CAUTION ON. BUT FOR US, FROM AN ASSET\nALLOCATION PERSPECTIVE, THE FED IS NOT MAKING IT EASY.\nIN THE NEAR TERM THEY'RE GOING TO GO THIS YEAR.\nIN THE LONGER TERM THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GO AS MUCH.\nTHAT'S THE KEY FOR THINGS LIKE THE DOLLAR, MERGING MARKETS,\nWHICH MAKE US BULLISH NOW. >> WHEN YOU SAY THEY'RE GOING TO\nGO THIS YEAR, YOU'RE NOT BANKING ON SEPTEMBER OR ARE YOU?\n>> SOME PEOPLE WERE SAYING SAME OLD JETS OVER THE WEEKEND, SAME\nOLD FED. THE FED HAS ALWAYS WAITED A\nQUARTER WHEN THEY -- WHEN FOLKS THINK THEY WANT IT TO GO.\nLOOK AT LAST YEAR. SEPTEMBER WASN'T REALLY 50%\nPRICING. SOME PEOPLE WERE SAYING YES.\nTHEY POINTED TO DECEMBER AS GOING.\nI THINK THAT'S WHAT THEY DO. THEY GO IN DECEMBER, NOT IN\nFRONT OF THE ELECTION. BUT ULTIMATELY, THAT LEVEL OF\nFED FUND RATE, PACE IS GOING TO BE LOWER.\n>> ARE YOU ON BOARD WITH DECEMBER?\n>> WE THINK DECEMBER AS WELL. THERE'S NO JUSTIFICATION TO GO\nIN SEPTEMBER GIVEN THE WEAKENING IN DATA AND LABOR MARKET INDEX\nIS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT THING.\n>> THAT WON'T STOP PEOPLE FROM TALKING ABOUT IT.\n>> ABSOLUTELY. >> IF JANET YELLIN WERE A REAL\nLEADER SHE WOULD CUT OFF THE MIKES RIGHT NOW.\nSHOULD SHE BE STIFLING THIS COMMENTARY?\n>> LIKE GREENSPAN BEFORE HER. HE NEVER ALLOWED THIS TO HAPPEN.\nIT'S CONFUSING FOR THE MARKETS. NEXT TRADING DAY YOU HAD\nSOMEBODY OFFSET WHAT WAS SAID BEFORE.\nWAY TOO MUCH INFORMATION. FED GOT THEMSELVES INTO THIS BY\nPUBLISHING ALL THIS TRANSPARENCY, DOTS, INFLATION\nFORECASTS. I THINK THAT'S PUT THEM IN A\nTOUGH SITUATION. >> WE ASKED FOR TRANSPARENCY.\nWE GOT T I CAN TELL YOU THAT. >> UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.\n>> FOR BETTER OR WORSE. GINA, PHIL, THANK YOU FOR THAT.\nGOOD TO SEE YOU.",

HE WILL JOIN OUR SHOW LIVE FOR\nMORE IDEAS AND WILL BRING YOU HIGHLIGHTS OF INTERVIEWS WITH\nOTHERS. LIVE FROM DELIVERING ALPHA IN\nNEW YORK CITY. LET'S START WITH THE PRICE OF\nOIL REVERSING GAINS. JACKIE DEANGELES HAS DETAILS.\n>> GOOD AFTERNOON. 3% SELL OFF TODAY AND CLOSING AT\n$44.90. THREE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS\nIMPACTING OIL PRICES. THE FIRST WOULD BE THE MONTHLY\nREPORT TAKING DEMAND FORECASTS DOWN NOT JUST FOR THIS YEAR BUT\nNEXT YEAR, AS WELL. THE WALL STREET THESIS FOR THIS\nREBOUND THAT IS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN DEPENDS ON DEMAND STAYING\nAT LEAST FLAT OR TICKING UP. SO THAT'S NOT REALLY A GOOD\nSIGN. THE EQUITY PLUNGED TODAY AND\nALSO A LITTLE BIT OF STRENGTH IN THE DOLLAR NOT GOOD SIGNS FOR\nCRUDE OIL. INVENTORIES TOMORROW.\nREMEMBER LAST WEEK WE SAW A DRAW DOWN OF 14 MILLION BARRELS.\nSOME ARE LOOKING FOR A PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL BUILD.\nTHOSE ARE THE ONES WHO THINK LAST WEEK'S ACTION WAS A ONE OFF\nEVENT. THE BUILD FACTOR BEING PRICED\nINTO OIL PRICES TODAY. AS YOU CAN SEE THE EFFECT THAT\nIT HA. ONE REASON THAT WILL HOLD THE\nALGERIA MEETING. IT'S THE WILDCARD.\nBACK TO YOU. >> THANK YOU.\nKEEPING AN EYE ON THOSE CRUDE PRICES BELOW $45 A BARREL.\nTRACKING HIS BROADER SELL OFF AGAIN HERE.\n>> THIS IS ALL ABOUT WORRIES ABOUT THE FED POSSIBLY RAISING\nRATES. WE HAVE A RISK OFF DAY.\nWE HAVE A DOUBLE WHAMMY HITTING OIL STOCKS.\nWE HAVE GENERAL RISK OFF DAY. EXXON GETTING HIT.\nIT HAS BEEN A STALWART RECENTLY BUT BREAKING DOWN.\nIT IS AT THE LOWEST LEVEL SINCE APRIL.\n$85 YOU SEE RIGHT THERE. YOU WANT TO SEE A RISK OFF DAY?\nYOU HEARD THE TEN YEAR YIELD DROPPED OFF.\nNORMALLY THIS WOULD BE A BIG HELP TO BANK STOCKS.\nTHEY WOULD MOVE UP ON THAT. HOW MUCH IS THIS DEBATE WITH THE\nFED FREAKING OUT? IT HAS GONE 11 TO 18.\nLOOK AT THAT AT 18. HERE ARE THE SPEECHES FOR\nOCTOBER AND NOVEMBER. IT'S WHERE THE CASH IS RIGHT\nNOW. THAT'S A HUGE INCREASE IN THE\nVIX. WE HAVE FLATTENING IN THE VIX.\nWE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT IN A VERY LONG TIME.\nBACK TO YOU. >> BOB, THANK YOU.\nLET'S GET TO THE KEY POINT IN THE LAST COUPLE OF SESSIONS\nGOING BACK TO FRIDAY STOCKS AND BONDS BOTH SELLING OFF.\nI SAT DOWN WITH PAUL SINGER EARLIER TODAY AT DELIVERING\nALPHA AND SPOKE ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY FOR SELL OFF IN\nTANDEM TO CONTINUE. >> IT'S BEEN SO LONG IN THE\nMAKING THAT THE BOND PRICES ARE SO HIGH, INTEREST RATES ARE SO\nLOW THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO ASCERTAIN WHAT CHANGE IN\nTHINKING WILL GENERATE A GROUP THINK WITH A DIFFERENT VECTOR,\nTHINKING THAT BONDS ARE NOT THE SAFE HAVEN THAT BOTH STOCKS AND\nBONDS CAN GO DOWN. I THINK GO DOWN TOGETHER.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT AND WHAT HE SAID IN OUR \"CLOSING\nBELL\" EXCHANGE. MICHAEL FAR JOINS US FROM D.C.\nKEITH IS HERE AT POST NINE AND JACK BERUZIAN.\nTYPICALLY STOCKS GO DOWN AND THAT MEANS BONDS GO UP BECAUSE\nIT IS TAKING MONEY OUT OF ONE ASSET CLASS AND PUTTING IT IN\nANOTHER. >> PRETTY SIGNIFICANT ON THE\nSHORT TERM MOVE BASIS. ON THE LONGER TERM WE HAVE TO\nGET BACK TO A VERSION ON RELATIONSHIPS WE HAVE COME TO\nUNDERSTAND OVER THE LAST FIVE, TEN YEARS.\nTHEY HAVE DEFINITELY GOTTEN OUT OF WHACK.\nMR. SINGER IS RIGHT ON THAT. ON A SHORT TERM BASIS YOU ARE\nSEEING BOTH GO DOWN BECAUSE MARKETS ARE SO TEMPERAMENTAL.\nPART OF THAT IS WHAT MR. SINGER IS SAYING IS THAT ANY LITTLE\nMATCH OR FUSE WILL SET THEM OFF IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.\nYOU TAKE A LOOK AT OIL PRICES GOING DOWN, EQUITIES GOING DOWN,\nBONDS GOING DOWN. THAT IS A CLASSIC CONCERN STORY\nAND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE SEEING. THE MOVEMENTS HAVE BEEN SO\nDRAMATIC. ON FRIDAY WE HAD MARKETS.\nTHE VIX OVERBOUGHT. TODAY WE HAD THEM GETTING BACK\nTO NEUTRAL. TODAY THEY ARE VASTLY OVERSOLD.\nI THINK SHORT TERM THIS IS A VERY GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO START\nNIBBLING AROUND THE EDGES. >> WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THIS\nENVIRONMENT? >> HOLDING MY BREATH AND SEEING\nWHICH WAY THIS IS GOING TO SHAKE OUT.\nWE STARTED LAST WEEK AND THE MARKET DECLINED ON THE FED NEWS.\nI NEVER BELIEVED IT. I WROTE THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO\nHAVE A RATE HIKE BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR.\nI CONTINUE TO HOLD THAT POSITION.\nI THINK THAT THE UNCERTAINTY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEK IS\nPROBABLY MORE POLITICAL. I THINK THAT THE EXPECTATIONS\nFOR A CLINTON PRESIDENCY MIGHT HAVE BEEN UPSET SOME OVER THE\nWEEKEND AND I THINK THAT YOU ARE SEEING SOME TRADERS BEGIN TO\nVOTE WITH THEIR FEET. PARTICULARLY WITH MR. TRUMP'S\nCRITICISM OF FED CHAIRMAN YELLEN.\nWALL STREET HAS A LOT TO DIGEST COMING INTO THE BEGINNING OF\nTHIS WEEK. >> THERE WAS A BIT OF A DEBATE\nON FRIDAY ABOUT THE SELLOFF THAT DAY WHETHER IT WAS ABOUT THE FED\nOR ABOUT NORTH KOREA. NOW WE THINK MAYBE THE ELECTION.\nWE'RE AT 173 ON THE TEN YEAR. WHAT IS THAT ALL ABOUT?\n>> COMBINATION OF ALL OF THE ABOVE.\nONE OF THE SOUND BYTES IS WHEN SINGER SAID NOTHING IS WORKING\nWHEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT CENTRAL BANKS.\nI THINK THAT WAS SO INSIGHTFUL. RIGHT NOW THAT SEEMS TO BE ONE\nOF THESE OPINIONS THAT IS CREEPING INTO THE MENTALITY OF\nTHE INVESTING PUBLIC. OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST\nCOUPLE OF MONTHS WE HAVE GONE THROUGH THE LOW VOLATILE\nENVIRONMENT. WE SAW PEOPLE CHASING RETURNS,\nCHASING YIELD AND STARTED GETTING INTO STOCKS, TREATING\nTHEM LIKE BONDS. NOW THEY ARE GETTING THE\nVOLATILITY BACK AND WHEN MICHAEL FAR SAID IS RIGHT.\nTHEY START TO SMELL THE ELECTION AND ALL OF THOSE UNCERTAINTIES.\nBEFORE YOU KNOW IT WE HAVE A BIG MOVE IN THE MARKETS.\nI THINK FRIDAY WAS THE BEGINNING OF SOMETHING.\nFRIDAY MIGHT BE THE START OF WHAT IN HIND SIGHT WE WILL LOOK\nAT AS THE BEGINNING OF A MOVE DOWN.\nIT STARTED AROUND THIS LEVEL LAST YEAR.\nWE MADE A HIGH OF 2135.

THANK YOU ALL.\nGOOD TO SEE YOU. >> FROM THE MACRO TO MICROSAYS\nHE IS SHORTING ALIBABA. TAKE A LISTEN.\n>> PEOPLE HAVE COMPARED AMAZON TO ALIBABA AND IT COULDN'T BE\nFURTHER FROM THE TRUTH.

AND YOU CAN LAY A LOT OF CLAIMS\nAND ACCUSATIONS ON OUR BUSINESS. ON THE LOGISTICS BUSINESS WE\nMADE FULL DISCLOSURE ON THE PROFITS, LOSS, REVENUES, ASSETS,\nLIABILITIES OF THE BUSINESS.

A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SHORT\nALIBABA FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS ABOUT ACCOUNTING AND STRUCTURE\nAND HOW YOU CAN TRADE SHARES AND HAVE OWNERSHIP.\nI THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING THE WAY TSAI WAS SAYING\nFUNDAMENTALLY OUR TOP LINE JUST KEEPS GROWING.\n>> AND IT DOES.

THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH SOME\nUSERS COMPLAINING THAT INSTALLING THE NEW SOFTWARE WAS\nRENDERING DEVICES USELESS. APPLE TELLING ME THAT HAS NOW\nBEEN RESOLVED. BEYOND THE SOFTWARE CONSUMERS\nWAITING FOR THE NEW HARDWARE. TODAY T MOBILE SAYING PREORDERS\nFOR iPHONE 7 AND 7 PLUS SHATTERED RECORDS AND MEANWHILE\nSPRINT SAYING PREORDERS INCREASED NEARLY FOUR TIMES.\nAPPLE STOCK MOVING HIGHER IN TODAY'S TRADE.\nNOTING CARRIERS ARE RUNNING AGGRESSIVE PROMOTIONS STILL\nCALLING THAT NEWS FROM THE CARRIERS POSITIVE AND\nENCOURAGING. BACK TO YOU.\n>> STAY WITH US. A COUPLE OF THINGS I'M WONDERING\nABOUT. SOME ARE POINTING OUT THEY\nWEREN'T BIG iPHONE SELLERS IN THE PAST.\nARE WE EXPECTING VERIZON AND AT&T TO COME OUT WITH FIGURES,\nTOO? >> I WOULD GUESS NOT AT THE SAME\nLEVEL OF INCREASE. THE MARKET ON A BAD DOWN DAY\nTOOK APPLE STOCK UP 2.4 PERCENT WHICH SHOWED YOU EXPECTATIONS\nWERE NOT VERY HIGH. >> THE GENERAL TREND THIS\nITERATION. WE JUST DON'T KNOW BECAUSE IT IS\nTHIS HALF YEAR AS OPPOSED TO FULL UPGRADE.\nANYTHING IS BETTER THAN NOT HAVING THOSE.\n>> I WONDER HOW MUCH THE GALAXY NOTE 7 DISASTER ENTERS IN HERE.\nOVER THE PAST WEEK WE HEARD STORIES ABOUT THE FAA SAYING\nDON'T TURN IT ON AND YOU WORRY ABOUT THIS SORT OF THING AND IT\nIS TAKE AG REAL CHUNK OUT OF SAMSUNG'S MARKET CAP.\nTHAT IS NOT HAVING SOME SORT OF EFFECT HERE WHERE PEOPLE SAY I'M\nNOT GOING TO BUY THAT THING. >> IS THERE ANYTHING TO GLEAN?\nI WANT EVERYBODY TO KEEP AN EYE OUT HERE.\nCARL ICAHN JUST ARRIVING. THERE IS CARL ICAHN MAKING THE\nWAY WITH HIS WIFE THERE TO THE STAGE WHERE HE WILL SHORTLY BE\nDELIVERING SOME REMARKS. AND BY THE WAY IT WILL BE\nINTERESTING TO SEE HOW MUCH HE GOES INTO THIS WHOLE BACK AND\nFORTH WHEN YOU THINK IT HAS BEEN PLAYED OUT THERE IS A NEW\nCHAPTER. >> ABSOLUTELY.\nTHE BILL ACMAN BACK AND FORTH. HE GOT A LITTLE BENEFIT WITH\nBULLISH COMMENTS FROM VALIANT EARLIER TODAY FROM BILL MILLER.\nBUT I DO THINK IT WILL BE FASCINATING THAT AND WHAT HE\nMIGHT SAY ABOUT POLITICS OR WHATEVER IS ON HIS MIND.\n>> JOSH, BY THE WAY, IF YOU ARE STILL THERE, I WAS GOING TO TIE\nUP THE SUBJECT WHEN IT COMES TO APPLE AND TO SAMSUNG, HAVE YOU\nHEARD ANY UPDATES ON JUST WHAT A SETBACK IT WAS THE FIRES FOR\nGALAXY NOTE 7 FOR SAMSUNG? >> NO DOUBT A SETBACK AND\nEMBARRASSING ONE FOR SAMSUNG. IF YOU TALK TO ANALYSTS THEY\nWILL SAY SAMSUNG IS DOING ITS BEST IN A TOUGH SITUATION.\nAS FOR THE IMPACT OF APPLE I KNOW THERE ARE SOME ANALYSTS\nTHAT HE DOES THINK SAMSUNG'S PAIN COULD BE APPLE'S GAINS WHEN\nIT COMES TO SMART PHONE. NOT A HUGE GAIN BUT COULD HAVE\nSOME MARGINAL IMPACT. >> DEPENDING ON WHO TELLS US\nWHAT FOR THE TIME BEING THANK",

IF YOU HAVE THE iPHONE 6 AND\nYOU'RE HAPPY WITH IT. WITH THE iPHONE 7 YOU SEEM EVEN\nMORE HESITANT. WE TEND TO COMPARE THESE PHONES\nYEAR TO YEAR. MOST CONSUMERS DON'T NECESSARILY\nDO THAT. HOW BIG AN UPGRADE IS THIS?\nWHO SHOULD UPGRADE? >> WELL, I MEAN, I THINK --\nLOOK, THEY'VE -- IT'S AN EXCELLENT PHONE.\nIT WAS AN EXCELLENT PHONE LAST YEAR.\nIT WAS AN EXCELLENT PHONE THE YEAR BEFORE.\nIT'S PRETTY MUCH THE SAME EXTERIOR AS THOSE TWO, AS YOU\nKNOW, JOHN. THEY'VE ACTUALLY ADDED ON THE\nINSIDE A WHOLE BUNCH OF SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS, WHICH\nI WON'T RUN THROUGH ALL OF THEM. BATTERY LIFE, WATER RESISTANCE.\nMORE MEMORY AT EVERY PRICE POINT.\nBUT WHAT REALLY HANGS ME UP ON THIS THIS YEAR ARE TWO THINGS.\nONE IS THAT WE KNOW, OR AT LEAST THEY'RE STRONGLY HINTING THAT A\nBIG, RADICAL, AWESOME RESIGN OF THE KIND THAT WE HAVE BEEN USED\nTO COMING FROM APPLE FOR YEARS IS COMING NEXT YEAR.\nTHE REASON IT LOOKS THE SAME THIS YEAR, THEY WANTED TO TAKE\nTWO CYCLES TO DO SOMETHING FANTASTIC.\nSO, WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO BUY THIS ONE WHEN YOU MIGHT WANT TO\nWAIT TILL NEXT YEAR? THE SECOND THING IS -- AND WE'VE\nTALKED TO DEATH ABOUT THIS. BUT THEY'VE REMOVED THE\nHEADPHONE JACK. FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE, THAT'S A\nPAIN IN THE NECK T MEANS ALL THE HEADPHONES AND EAR BUDS THAT\nTHEY OWN WILL NO LONGER WORK OR WILL REQUIRE AN ADAPTER.\nTHEY'RE TRYING TO MOVE THE WORLD TO WIRELESS.\nTHEY'VE INVENTED THEIR OWN WIRELESS.\nI'M WEARING ONE OF THEM. IT'S THIS EAR POD THING.\n>> VERY FASHIONABLE, JUST TO HAVE IT IN ONE EAR.\n>> THAT'S THE POINT. IT LOOKS KIND OF LIKE A PLASTIC\nEARRING. BE HONEST WITH ME HERE.\n>> WELL -- >> AND IF THAT'S YOUR STYLE,\nTHAT'S COOL. FOR ALL I KNOW, MAYBE IT WILL\nBECOME SOMETHING EVERYONE WILL WANT TO WEAR.\nIT'S GOING TO COST $159 AND GIVE YOU TWO HOURS OF PHONE TALKING\nTIME BETWEEN CHARGES AND YOU'LL HAVE TO PUT THEM BACK IN THIS\nLITTLE CASE TO RECHARGE. THEY RECHARGE QUICKLY.\n>> HERE IS MY ISSUE WITH THE WAY APPLE HAS APPROACHED THIS\nHEADPHONE SOCKET THING AND THE WIRELESS THING.\nI APPRECIATE THAT THEY'VE GOT THIS W1 CHIP TO MAKE WIRELESS\nWORK MORE EASILY WITH FUTURE VERSIONS.\nTHEY'RE INTRODUCING THIS NEW CHIP AND TAKING THE HEADPHONE\nSOCKET OUT AT THE SAME TIME. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE IF THEY\nINTRODUCED IT A CYCLE AGO AND THEN TAKE IT AWAY, THE\nHEADPHONES, ONCE THEY'VE PROVEN THIS OUT.\nTO DO BOTH AT ONCE, ISN'T THAT KIND OF JARRING?\n>> I COMPLETELY AGREE. I'LL ADD A THIRD THING.\nWHY DO THIS IN THE YEAR WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE A BIG REDESIGN\nOF THE OUTSIDE? IN OTHER WORDS THEY'RE ASKING\nYOU TO BUY A PHONE THAT LOOKS JUST LIKE THE LAST TWO.\nAND I WANT TO GIVE THEM THEIR DUE.\nTHERE'S A LOT OF ADVANTAGES. IT STILL LOOKS LIKE THE LAST\nTWO. AND, AS YOU SAY, THEY'RE TAKING\nTHE HEADPHONE JACK AND TRYING THIS WIRELESS THING ALL AT ONCE.\nIT SEEMS LIKE PHASING THOSE THINGS MIGHT HAVE MADE MORE\nSENSE.

WE AGREE WITH THEM THAT FIRMS\nSHOULD PAY THEIR TAXES. WHEN IT'S U.S. INCOME, WE THINK\nTHAT TAX SHOULD BE PAID IN THE UNITED STATES.\n>> MEANTIME, iPHONE 7 REVIEWS ARE OUT.\nAND THE VERDICT IS -- WELL, IT'S PRETTY MIXED.\nLIP TO THE 7 MAY BE WISE FOR SOME.\nUSA TODAY SAYS IF YOU CAN HOLD OUT, YOU SHOULD.\nSENIOR WRITER AND TONY SAKINATI. DEMAND IS FOUR TIMES THE\nPREVIOUS iPHONE. IS THAT PROOF POSITIVE, THAT\nTHIS WILL BE A REALLY BIG DEAL FOR APPLE?\n>> I THINK YOU HAVE TO KEEP THOSE DATA POINTS IN CONTEXT BUT\nTHEY'RE CLEARLY POSITIVE. FIRST, THERE ARE ONLY TWO\nCARRIERS. SECONDLY, ALL THE U.S. CARRIERS\nARE RUNNING VERY AGGRESSIVE PROMOTIONS WHERE YOU CAN TRADE\nIN AN OLD PHONE AND GET AN iPHONE 7 FOR FREE.\nWE DIDN'T SEE THESE KIND OF PROMOTIONS LAST YEAR.\nSO THE COMPARABLES A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.\nALL THAT SAID SPRINT AND T-MOBILE MIGHT ACCOUNT FOR 5% OF\nFLOEBL VOLUMES FOR APPLE. AFTER THE FIRST FOUR DAYS TO\nHAVE THOSE UP THREE TIMES ON 5% OF YOUR BASE IS CERTAINLY\nENCOURAGING. IT'S EARLY DAYS AND THE\nPROMOTIONS ARE DIFFERENT. >> AND BECAUSE WE WON'T GET MUCH\nSALES DATA FROM APPLE, IT WILL BE IMPORTANT TO DEDUCE FROM\nTHESE. WE JUST SPOKE TO WALT MOSSBERG\nABOUT THIS. THE APPEARANCE ISN'T THAT\nDIFFERENT. THE BIG FEATURES ARE THE CAMERA\nAND THINGS INSIDE. IF PEOPLE CAN'T SEE THE\nDIFFERENCE, CAN'T FEEL IT, WILL THAT BE AN OBSTACLE FOR THEM?\n>> YEAH, I HAVE TO SAY I LIKED HIS ONE EARRING LOOK WITH THE\nSINGLE EAR BUD. IT'S INTERESTING THAT THE\nBIGGEST DIFFERENCE IS ONE THAT'S GETTING A LOT OF SORT OF\nAMUSEMENT AND PUZZLEMENT, WHICH ARE THESE WIRELESS HEADPHONES OR\nEAR BUDS. I THINK THE BIGGEST THING GOING\nFOR IT IS THAT ITS PATRYS DON'T EXPLODE.\nTHAT DOESN'T BODE SO WELL. AS MOSSBERG SAID EARLIER, I\nTHINK PEOPLE ARE HOLDING OUT FOR WHAT GOING TO COME NEXT YEAR.\nEARLY NUMBERS, JUST LIKE TONI SAID, THEY'RE FROM T-MOBILE,\nSPRINT. IT DOESN'T ACCOUNT FOR SUCH A\nLARGE PERCENTAGE AND CUSTOMERS ARE BASICALLY BE ASKED TO SELL\nTHEIR SOULS FOR ANOTHER TWO YEARS TO DO THIS TRADE-IN.\nNOT SURE WHAT TO MAKE OF THE EARLY NUMBERS QUITE YET.\n>> GIVEN THAT THE 6S UPDATE WASN'T THAT HUGE JUST IN TERMS\nOF THE GROWTH THAT APPLE SAW FROM ONE GENERATION TO THE NEXT,\nIS THE BAR MAYBE NOT THAT HIGH FOR THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE 7?\nREVIEWS SAID IF YOU'RE HAPPY WITH THE 6, YOU DON'T HAVE TO\nUPGRADE TO THE 6S. THE REVIEWS SAY IF YOU'RE HAPPY\nWITH WHAT YOU HAVE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO UPGRADE TO THE 7.\nPEOPLE'S PHONES ARE GETTING OLD. MIGHT WE FINALLY GET THAT BUMP\nFROM THE UPGRADERS WHETHER THERE'S THAT REVIEW OR NOT?\n>> WE COULD. THAT'S THE MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR\nQUESTION. PHONES THAT ARE USED AND HAVE\nBEEN RESOLD. THAT INSTALL BASE IS 50% HIGHER\nENTERING THE iPHONE 7 CYCLE THAN IT WAS TWO YEARS AGO, ENTERING\nTHE iPHONE 6 CYCLE. CERTAINLY THE INSTALL BASE IS\nMUCH BIGGER. OUR BELIEF IS OVER TIME YOU\nSHOULD HAVE MORE iPHONE UNIT SALES.\nIT'S TRICKY TO KNOW HOW MANY MIGHT UPGREAT THIS YEAR AND HOW\nMANY MIGHT WAIT. TODAY IT'S ABOUT 80% ARE\nUPGRADING. THE DYNAMIC OF THE COMPOSITION\nOF WHO IS BUYING PHONES, TODAY IT'S ALL REPLACEMENT.\nFIVE YEARS AGO IT WAS LARGELY FIRST-TIME BUYERS.\n>> I HAVE TO SAY I'M ALMOST EMBARRASSED TO ADMIT THIS, BUT I\nAM STILL ON AN iPHONE 5. I WILL BE UPGRADING, BUT IT'S\nNOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE I'M THAT EXCITED ABOUT THIS NEW PHONE.\nI TOTALLY FIT INTO THAT DEMOGRAPHIC.\nIT'S EMBARRASSING AAS A TECH WRITER.\n>> SHE HAS A POINT. THAT LEADS TO MY FOLLOW-UP.\nWHY IS IT THAT PEOPLE UPGRADE TO THE 6S OR SE INSTEAD OF THE 7?\nANY WAY YOU HAVE OF CALCULATING THAT?\n>> AS FAR AS APPLE IS CONCERNED, PEOPLE BUYING NEW PHONES IS GOOD\nFOR THEIR BUSINESS. WHETHER THEY UPGRADE TO A 7 OR\niPHONE 6S, THE MARGINS ARE LIKELY PRETTY SIMILAR.\nTHE PLUS MODELS TEND TO HAVE BETTER MARGINS.\nTHE REVENUES ARE A BIT BETTER ON THE iPHONE 7 OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE\nOF THE HIGHER PRICES. BUT FOR APPLE AND FOR THE\nINVESTMENT COMMUNITY, IT'S REALLY NUMBER OF UNITS SOLD.\nAND I THINK APPLE HAS INCREASINGLY TRIED TO PROVIDE\nALTERNATIVES FOR CONSUMERS, WHETHER IT BE THE SE,\nONE-YEAR-OLD PHONE OR CURRENT MODEL PHONE.\nTHAT'S GOING TO BE THE DOMINANT DRIVER OF ITS ECONOMICS LESS SO\nTHE MYTHS. >> LEGAL BATTLE TO COME BETWEEN\nAPPLE AND THE EU. TREASURY SECRETARY WEIGHING IN\nTODAY. HE'S STARTING TO USE APPLE AS A\nCARROT FOR TAX REFORM. SURE IT'S A CONSUMER-FACING\nCOMPANY. IT HAS HOUSEHOLD NAME\nRECOGNITION. DO YOU THINK IT WILL WORK?\n>> I THINK IT COULD, ACTUALLY. I THINK IT'S REALLY INTERESTING\nTHAT, YOU KNOW, APPLE, WHICH WE USED TO LOOK AT JUST AS PRODUCT\nINNOVATION, RIGHT? THAT'S WHERE IT WAS TREND\nSETTING. NOW THE ATTENTION HAS BEEN MUCH\nMORE ON APPLE VERSUS THE FBI AND APPLE VERSUS THE EU.\nTHERE'S STILL A LOT THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN.\nI THINK IT WILL BE A TREND-SETTER IN TERMS OF TAX\nREFORM. SO, YES, A LOT COULD HAPPEN JUST\nBECAUSE OF WHAT APPLE HAS SORT OF STARTED AGAIN.\nTHIS TIME AROUND IT'S NOT ON THE PRODUCT INNOVATION SIDE, WHICH\nIS KIND OF FUNNY. >> TO BE CONTINUED.\nMICHAL LEV-RAM AND TONI, THANK",

THAT MAY HAVE BEEN A BIGGER\nPROBLEM FOR THEN CANDIDATE OBAMA BACK IN 2008 WHEN HE MADE A\nSIMILAR COMMENT ABOUT CONSERVATIVES, ABOUT REPUBLICANS\nWHO CLING TO GUNS AND RELIGION. IN THIS CASE I THINK THE BIGGER\nPROBLEM FOR HER IS HER PENCHANT FOR SECRECY, FOR DECEPTION.\nSO I THINK THE PNEUMONIA DIAGNOSIS, NOT RELEASING THAT TO\nTHE PRESS, I THINK THAT MORE REINFORCES WHAT PEOPLE DON'T\nLIKE ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON THAN SOMETHING LIKE THIS.\n>> IT SHOWS A BIG STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS.\nTHIS COMMENT BY CLINTON IS AN OPPORTUNITY.\n>> IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR DONALD TRUMP TO GET ON A BOX AND\nA HIGH HORSE AND SAY HOW DARE SHE TALK ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE THIS,\nSUCH CONTEMPT. SHE CAN'T BE PRESIDENT THIS WAY.\nHIM OF ALL PEOPLE. WE COULD PUT ON TV RIGHT NOW AT\nLEAST TEN THINGS HE HAS SAID THAT WERE EQUALLY OR GREATER IN\nTERMS OF THEIR OFFENSIVENESS SO WHAT'S HIS PLAY ON THIS?\n>> YOU KNOW, I THINK THIS PLAY IS DIFFICULT FOR HIM.\nYOU'VE SEEN SOME OF THE POLLS THAT HAVE SAID 44% OF AMERICANS\nINCLUDING 40% PLUS OF INDEPENDENTS DESCRIBE TRUMP AS\nRACIST. SOME 60% THINK THAT HE'S BIASED\nAGAINST WOMEN AND MINORITIES. SO I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.\nIT'S NOT ONLY BEEN THE COMMENTS BUT IT'S BEEN A LARGER\nPERCEPTION THAT'S BEEN HARDER FOR HIM.\nMAKING NEWS AND HE'S BEEN QUIET ON THE HEALTH ISSUE.\nI WONDER IF THIS WILL LAST FOR LONG.\nIF THIS DOESN'T MAKE ENOUGH GROUND THIS WILL PIVOT.\n>> DAVID, I'M INTERESTED IN YOUR DEFINITION OF DEFINING MOMENTS\nBECAUSE I THINK THAT IS A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT TAKE ON IT.\nSARAH PALIN WHEN SHE COULDN'T ANSWER KATIE COURIC'S QUESTION\nABOUT WHAT NEWS SOURCES DO YOU USE, BARACK OBAMA WHEN HE SAID\nWHEN PEOPLE FEEL DESPERATE THEY CLING TO THEIR GUNS AND TO\nRELIGION. SO IN THAT GIVEN THAT PRISM DO\nYOU THINK THAT THE VIDEO OF HILLARY CLINTON FAINTING OR\nCERTAINLY -- OR STUMBLING OR NEEDING TO BE HELPED INTO THE\nVAN IS MORE OF A DEFINING MOMENT THAT FITS INTO WHAT YOU'RE\nTALKING ABOUT THAT SHOWS SECRECY?\n>> YES, I DO THINK THAT IS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S -- IT'S\nTHIS IDEA THAT, LOOK, I'M NOT GOING TO SHARE THIS INFORMATION\nBECAUSE MY CRITICS WILL DO THE WRONG THING WITH IT.\nTHEY'LL BLOW IT OUT OF PROPORTION.\nSO, YES, I HAVE PNEUMONIA, BUT I'M GOING TO KEEP GOING.\nI'M GOING TO STAY ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\nI'M GOING TO POWER THROUGH THIS. LET'S KEEP IT IN A CLOSE CIRCLE\nOF AIDES AND TELL ME CAMPAIGN TEAM AND NOT DISCLOSE IT\nPUBLICLY. THEN YOU CREATE A BACKLASH.\nTHEY'VE FELT THEY'RE TOO DECEPTIVE, SECRETIVE.\nTHAT'S THE KNOCK AGAINST THEM LESS SO THAN SHE'S AN ELITIST.\n>> THE ONE THAT YOU DIDN'T MENTION IS TRUMP WANTS TO TIE\nTHIS TO MITT ROMNEY WITH THE 47%.\nWE'LL SEE IF IT HAS THAT. 16 FOR 16.\nWHAT IS THIS PBS SHOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO WATCH?\n>> REALLY INTERESTING SERIES ABOUT THE MOST IMPORTANT, MOST\nINTERESTING, MOST UNEXPECTED PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS FROM\nSHIRLEY CHISM, BARRY GOLDWATER. A LOT OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN\nTHE LAST EIGHT WEEKS OF THE CAMPAIGN.\n>> YOUR FAVORITE? >> SHIRLEY CHISM.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T REMEMBER, YOU PROBABLY DO AS A NEW YORKER.\nSHE WAS THE FIRST BLACK CONGRESSWOMAN FROM QUEENS.\nFOUR YEARS AFTER GETTING ELECTED DECIDES TO MAKE A BOLD BID FOR\nTHE PRESIDENCY. EXPECTS A TON OF SUPPORT FROM\nALLIES, WOMEN, AFRICAN-AMERICAN LEADERS.\nGOT NOT MUCH OF EITHER. ENDED UP LOSING.\nBROKE GROUND THAT WAS IMPORTANT LATER ON FOR JESSE JACKSON AND\nBARACK OBAMA. 8:00 P.M. EASTERN TIME.\n>> TUESDAY NIGHT. >> FANTASTIC, CARLOS, DAVID.\nGREAT TO SEE BOTH OF YOU GUYS.

THAT'S JUST NOT EVEN SERIOUS.\nI'VE RELEASED 40 YEARS OF TAX RETURNS, HE HASN'T RELEASED ONE.\nTHIS IS A MAN WITH UNKNOWN NUMBERS OF PARTNERS AND\nINVESTORS WHO SAYS HE'S DOING 120 FOREIGN DEALS.\nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE TO KNOW WHAT HE'S UP TO AND WHAT\nHE'S HIDING. IF WE WEREN'T FAST ENOUGH, I\nTALKED TO MY STAFF, WE TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT, BUT THE\nINFORMATION IS OUT THERE. YOU CAN'T SAY THE SAME THING\nABOUT DONALD TRUMP. >> THIS WHOLE -- YOU KNOW, A LOT\nOF THE ARGUMENTS SURROUNDING THIS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN ONE OF\nTRANSPARENCY. ARGUMENTS OF TRANSPARENCY,\nDOUGLAS. IS SHE BEING HELD TO A HIGHER\nSTANDARD? >> I THINK SHE IS.\nPEOPLE -- LARGELY BECAUSE OF THE E-MAILS, I MEAN, THE FACT THAT\nSHE WAS IN GOVERNMENT, A SECRETARY OF STATE, AND HAD THAT\nALTERNATIVE SERVERS CAUSED HER ENDLESS PROBLEMS, SHE DOESN'T\nSEEM ABLE TO GET THAT ALBATROSS BEHIND HER.\nHOWEVER, THERE DOES SEEM AT TIMES THAT TRUMP GETS A FREE\nPASS, HE KIND OF BULLIES HIS WAY THROUGH THE NEWS CYCLE.\nYOU KNOW, THE IDEA THAT HE'S -- THIS FAR ALONG, MAYBE GOING TO\nBECOME PRESIDENT WITHOUT RELEASING HIS TAXES, THE FACT\nTHAT HE HAS A FOUNDATION THAT THE WASHINGTON POST IS REPORTING\nTHAT HAS, SEEMS LIKE, EMPTY COFFERS, THE\nFACT THAT TRUMP UNIVERSITY IS ONE OF THE BIG TIME SCAMS IN\nRECENT AMERICAN POLITICAL HISTORY.\nBUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO STICK TO HIM, HE'S ALWAYS ON THE OFFENSE,\nAND I FEEL HILLARY CLINTON'S OFF -- OFTEN ON THE DEFENSE.\nSHE NEEDS TO GET OUT AFTER SHE HEALS AND REALLY TRY TO BRING\nSOME FUN AND JOY TO HER CAMPAIGN AND GO FOR\nBROKE. SHE'S UP IN THE POLLS BY ABOUT\nFIVE POINTS. I THINK IF SHE COULD BRING A FUN\nFACTOR TO WHAT SHE'S DOING, IT WOULD GO A LONG WAYS, AND\nMEANWHILE, MAYBE SOME JOURNALISTS WILL FIND SOME\nTHINGS ON TRUMP AS WE HEAD INTO THE FIRST DEBATE.\n>> I THOUGHT WHAT YOU SAID TO THE PRODUCER, IT'S A MARATHON\nRUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, YOU CAN'T COLLAPSE AT THIS JUNCTURE.\nTHE VIDEO OF HER STUMBLING AT THE VEHICLE, EVERY TIME IT IS\nSHOWN IT IS DAMAGING. THERE'S A REASON FDR WAS NEVER\nPHOTOGRAPHED IN A WHEELCHAIR, IT'S A CAUSE FOR CONCERN WHEN\nYOU'RE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. >> WELL, ABSOLUTELY, AND PEOPLE\nWANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW.\nWE'RE A VERY HUNGRY INFORMATION DRIVEN SOCIETY, THE IDEA THAT\nYOU CAN HAVE PNEUMONIA ON FRIDAY AND NOBODY'S GOING TO FIND OUT\nABOUT IT, THAT'S UTTERLY RIDICULOUS.\nSOMEHOW THE WORD WOULD GET OUT. BUT SHE DIDN'T REALLY DO\nANYTHING WRONG, WE'RE ALL PRAYING FOR HER TO GET BETTER\nAND GET BACK INTO THE GAME. I THINK SHE WILL.\nCALLING IN ANDERSON COOPER WAS A GREAT MOVE.\nI THINK EVEN IF SHE'S PRONE IN BED TOMORROW, SHE SHOULD DO SOME\nRADIO INTERVIEWS AND STAY ACTIVE.\nJUST DON'T PUNT FOR FIVE DAYS STRAIGHT.\n>> LET'S TALK MORE ABOUT WHAT SHE SAID TO ANDERSON COOPER.\nI WAS WATCHING YOUR -- YOU HAD A PIECE ON ANDERSON, YOU\nTALKED ABOUT HER HISTORY OF HEALTH ISSUES.\nIN 1998. IS IT A CAUSE FOR CONCERN THAT\nSHE SAID, SEVERAL OCCASIONS SHE FELT DEHYDRATED, SHE'S DIZZY.\nIS THAT A CAUSE FOR CONCERN? >> WELL, IT'S INTERESTING, SHE\nREALLY SAID -- SHE SORT OF THOUGHT ABOUT IT WHEN ANDERSON\nASKED HER, AND SHE SAID TWICE IT'S HAPPENED THAT I CAN RECALL.\n>> THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S HOW SHE PHRASED IT.\nTHE ONE TIME OBVIOUSLY NOW, AND I THINK SHE'S REFERRING BACK TO\n2012. I MEAN, I THINK WHAT THE 2012\nINCIDENT WAS SHE FELL AND HIT HER HEAD, DEVELOPED A BLOOD\nCLOT, THERE WAS CAUSE FOR CONCERN.\nPATIENTS NEED TO BE MONITORED, EVALUATED, AND ACCORDING TO THE\nMEDICAL LETTER WE GOT, WHICH IS JUST TWO PAGES, IT DID TALK\nABOUT THIS, SHE WAS RE-EVALUATED AND THERE WAS NO LONG TERM\nIMPACT ON THE BRAIN, IN A THE BLOOD CLOT HAD RESOLVED.\nSO, YEAH, THERE'S CONCERN, BUT AT LEAST WITHIN HER MEDICAL\nNOTE, IT'S NOT A FULL RECORD, AT LEAST WITHIN THE NOTE, IT'S\nTALKED ABOUT THOSE CONCERNS AND WHAT WAS DONE TO ASSESS THOSE\nCONCERNS AND IT SEEMS TO HAVE RESOLVED.\n>> SHE WILL RELEASE MORE DETAILED INFORMATION.\n>> NOT COMPLETE, BUT MORE. >> MORE.\n>> YEAH. >> I WANT TO GET TO YOU, JIM,\nYOU ARE COVERING A TRUMP CAMPAIGN, AND THEN YOU WERE\nCOVERING A RALLY AND THERE WERE SOME TENSE MOMENTS.\nWHAT CAN YOU TELL BUS THAT? >> IT'S NOT TOO SURPRISING.\nTHIS IS A FAIRLY DEMOCRATIC CITY AND CONSERVATIVE PART OF NORTH\nCAROLINA. WE SAW A CLASH PLAY OUT, DURING\nDONALD TRUMP'S REMARKS, A DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTER WAS\nCLEARLY IRRITATED WITH A GROUP OF PROTESTERS WHO WERE AROUND\nHIM, AND HE STARTED HITTING AND PUNCHING AND CHOKING EVEN ONE OF\nTHE PROTESTERS HE WAS AROUND. EVENTUALLY AT ONE\nPOINT THESE PROTESTERS WERE LET OUT OF THIS RALLY, DON.\nAS FAR AS WE CAN TELL, THE SUPPORTER NEVER LEFT AND WAS NOT\nARRESTED BY AUTHORITIES. >> INTERESTING.\nALSO AT THAT RALLY, HE TALKED ABOUT THIS NOW INFAMOUS BASKET\nOF DEPLORABLES REMARK, WHAT DID HE SAY?\n>> YEAH, THIS IS THE GIFT BASKET THAT KEEPS ON GIVING AS FAR AS\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS CONCERNED. DONALD TRUMP LATCHED ON TO THAT\nCOMMENT AGAIN. HE ACCUSED HILLARY CLINTON\nOF RUNNING A CAMPAIGN OF HATRED. AT ONE POINT DURING THE RALLY,\nHE INVITED SOME OF HIS SUPPORTERS ON STAGE TO SAY\nTHEY'RE NOT DEPLORABLE. HERE'S MORE OF WHAT DONALD TRUMP\nHAD TO SAY AT THIS RALLY IN ASHVILLE EARLIER TONIGHT.\n>> SHE CALLED THE AMERICANS EVERY NAME IN THE BOOK, RACIST,\nSEXIST XENOPHOBIC, ISLAMO PHOBIC.\nSHE SAID THEY WERE NOT EVEN AMERICAN.\nANYBODY XENOPHOBIC? I DON'T THINK SO.\nI DON'T THINK SO. NEVER IN HISTORY HAS A MAJOR\nPARTY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SO VICIOUSLY DEMONIZED THE AMERICAN\nVOTER. >> AND DON WE SHOULD POINT OUT,\nJUST TO CLARIFY WHAT DONALD TRUMP HAS SAID THERE, HILLARY\nCLINTON NEVER SAID THAT HIS SUPPORTERS WERE NOT EVEN\nAMERICAN AS HE PUT IT, DURING THE RALLY TONIGHT.\nHE JUST SIMPLY TOOK THAT ONE TOO FAR, IN TERMS OF BEING\nXENOPHOBIC, HE'S BEEN ACCUSED OF THAT TIME AGAIN THROUGHOUT THIS\nCAMPAIGN, IF YOU LOOK BACK TO HIS -- THE LAUNCH OF HIS\nCAMPAIGN, WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS BEING\nRAPISTS AND DRUG DEALERS AND CRIMINALS AND SO FORTH.\nTHOSE WERE DEEMED TO BE XENOPHOBIC REMARKS BY A LOT OF\nPEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. >> GOING BACK TO THE\nTRANSPARENCY IN THIS CAMPAIGN. DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN IS\nCALLING FOR TRANSPARENCY. DOES THAT EXTEND TO TAXES DO YOU\nTHINK? >> THEY HAVEN'T BEEN TALKING\nABOUT RELEASING HIS TAXES, IN SO FAR AS I CAN TELL, DONALD TRUMP\nHAS NO INTENTION OF DOING THAT. THE WAY HILLARY CLINTON IS\nTRYING TO SORT OF GET OUT OF THIS MESS SHE'S IN ON A LOT OF\nLEVELS HERE IS THAT SHE'S TRYING TO TURN THIS ISSUE ON ITS HEAD\nAND TALK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S TRANSPARENCY, AS SHE SAID TO\nANDERSON EARLIER THIS EVENING, AND THIS IS TRUE, IT IS A FACT\nTHAT SHE HAS RELEASED MORE OF HER HEALTH RECORDS THAN DONALD\nTRUMP HAS. HE'S RELEASED ONE LETTER FROM\nHIS GASTROENTEROLOGIST AND SAYS HE'S GOING TO HAVE A PHYSICAL\nAND RELEASE THE RESULTS OF THAT. SHE'S SAYING, OKAY, I'VE BEEN\nMORE TRANSPARENT THAN HE HAS, AND I INTEND TO RELEASE MORE\nRECORDS. TAKING IT A STEP FURTHER TO HIS\nTAX RETURNS WHICH HE HAS NOT RELEASED.\nSHE SAID TONIGHT THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS MADE 120 FOREIGN\nDEALS, WHAT IS HE HIDING. AND THAT'S A CLEAR POINT SHE\nWANTS TO MAKE. BECAUSE YOU MIGHT KNOW WHAT\nDEALS HE WAS MAKING IF YOU COULD SEE HIS TAX RETURNS.\nTHIS IS GOING TO BE AN ISSUE CONTINUES.\nSHE DIDN'T HELP HERSELF BY NOT LETTING THE PUBLIC KNOW ABOUT\nHER PNEUMONIA. BUT WHAT SHE IS SAYING IS\nIN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS, THIS IS SMALL POTATOES COMPARED\nTO THE DECISION THAT AMERICANS HAVE TO MAKE ABOUT A PRESIDENT\nBEING TRANSPARENT. >> GLORIA, DOUGLAS, JIM, AND\nDOCTOR, ALWAYS A PLEASURE.",

CLINTON OF RUNNING A HATE-FILLED CAMPAIGN AND DIDN'T\nSTOP THERE. HAVE A LISTEN.\n>> SHE TALKS ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE THEY'RE OBJECTS, NOT HUMAN\nBEINGS. SHE CALLED THESE AMERICANS EVERY\nNAME IN THE BOOK. RACISTS, SEXISTS, SXENOPHOBIC,\nISLAMOPHOBIC. NEVER IN HISTORY HAS A MAJOR\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SO VICIOUSLY DEMONIZED THE AMERICAN\nVOTER. >> I THINK HE MEANT TO SAY\nXENOPHOBIC. FUNNY HE MENTIONED DEMONIZING\nAND HATE-FILLED SPEECH, BECAUSE THAT'S HOW HI CAMPAIGN IS\nDESCRIBED BY A LOT OF PEOPLE. A FEW THINGS HE'S SAID ABOUT\nMEXICANS AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN PEOPLE, JUST TO REFRESH YOUR\nMEMORY. >> WHEN MEXICO SENDS ITS PEOPLE,\nTHEY'RE NOT SENDING THEIR BEST. THEY'RE BRINGING DRUGS.\nTHEY'RE BRINGING CRIME. THEY'RE RAPISTS, AND SOME, I\nASSUME, ARE GOOD PEOPLE. >> IT IS A DISASTER, THE WAY\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE LIVING IN MANY CASES, AND IN MANY CASES\nTHE WAY HISPANICS ARE LIVING. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE?\nI WILL STRAIGHTEN IT OUT. I WILL BRING JOBS BACK.\nWE'LL BRING SPIRIT BACK.

TRUMP TREATED THE PRESS\nDEPLORABLE, PENNED US UP, BLACKBALLED PEOPLE WHO ASKS\nQUESTIONS HE DOESN'T THINK IS FAIR.\nHILLARY CLINTON, NO PROTECTION IN EITHER OF THEIR CAMPS AND\nJUST LAST WEEK WHEN A PRESS PERSON DARED TO TALK ABOUT THE\nCOUGHING, THE QUOTE FROM THE CAMPAIGN IS, \"GET A LIFE.\"\nNOT PARTICULARLY GOOD BEHAVIOR ON EITHER OF THEIR PARTS.\n>> NOT AT ALL, BUT ASHLEIGH, I THINK THE KEY ISSUE IS THIS --\nBOTH OF THESE CAMPAIGNS ARE GOING TO TREAT THE PRESS AS\nBADLY AS THEY'RE ALLOWED TO AND AS BADLY AS THE VOTERS ALLOW\nTHEM TO. THE CLINTONS HAVE BEEN\nSECRETIVE, SOMETIMES THEY'RE DOING BAD THINGS, SOMETIMES\nBECAUSE THEY'RE PARANOID. TRUMP THREATENED PEOPLE,\nSNATCHED PRESS CREDENTIALS PEOPLE I KNOW AFTER THEY'VE\nREGISTERED FOR THINGS AND MORE SO, WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT HIS\nHEALTH, HE'LL TALK TO DR. OZ, NOT A JOURNALIST.\nIT'S ABOUT BOTH CANDIDATES REALIZING I CAN TREAT THE PRESS\nHOWEVER I WANT, THE VOTERS AREN'T GOING TO MIND.\nWE NEED ANSWERS FROM BOTH OF THESE CANDIDATES BEFORE WE GO TO\nTHE VOTING BOOTH SO THAT IS UNFORTUNATE.\n>> AND LET ME BRING YOU BACK ON THE DIVISIVENESS.\nTHERE WERE SUPPORTERS BROUGHT UP ONSTAGE WITH TRUMP LAST NIGHT.\nI THINK A COUPLE OF EDUCATORS. AVERAGE AMERICANS WHO GOT UP ON\nTHAT STAGE AND SPOKE TO THAT CROWD SAYING I'M THE TRUMP\nSUPPORTER AM I ONE OF THE ONES IN THAT BASKET OF DEPLORABLES?\n>> IT'S VERY INTERESTING. THIS IS A STAGE OF THE CAMPAIGN\nAND A CONTROVERSY THAT BOTH CAMPAIGNS WANT TO TALK ABOUT.\nTHE DEPLORABLES ISSUE ALLOWS DONALD TRUMP, AS YOU SAID, TO\nPOSE AS THINK CHAMPION OF HEARTLAND, BLUE COLLAR VOTERS,\nTO RE-CREATE THAT PERSONA THAT HELPED HIM WIN THE PRIMARY RACE\nAND PORTRAY HILLARY CLINTON AT THE ELITE FROM THE EAST.\nA GOOD MESSAGE IN SWING STATES, MAY HELP SLIGHTLY AMONG VOTERS\nPERHAPS ON THE FENCE, BUT HAVE GREAT SUSPICIONS OF WASHINGTON\nAND GREAT IS A PSUSPICIONS OF T MEDIA AND DEMOCRATS.\nIT MAY PUSH VOTES IN THIS DIRECTION.\nAT THE SAME TIME, THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS ENGAGING ON THIS.\nIS IT ABOUT WHETHER TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN IS AN XENOPHOBES AND\nBIGOTS, SEXISTS, THAT'S GOOD FOR THEM.\nTHE WAY HILLARY CLINTON WINS THE GENERAL ELECTION IS DRIVE OUT\nTHE OBAMA COALITION FROM 2008 AND 2012 NAP IS THE KIND OF\nMESSAGE THAT COULD GET PEOPLE TO THE POLLS OR PERHAPS SORT OF\nWORRIED ABOUT WHETHER, AM I GOING TO VOTE FOR HILLARY?\nSHOW UP, OR NOT? >> SO, LARRY, YOU KNOW, IF YOU\nWERE WATCHING LAST NIGHT, A LOT OF VIDEO OF A TRUMP SUPPORTER IN\nTHE CROWD WHO APPEARED TO ATTACK A PROTESTORS.\nREALLY PHYSICALLY. I MEAN CHOKE AND PUNCH ONE OF\nTHE PROTESTORS. WE'VE SEEN THIS IN THE PAST.\nIT DOESN'T SEEM TO GET A LOT OF PLAY AFTER ABOUT TWO, THREE\nWEEKS, BUT HERE WE ARE AGAIN WITH NEW VIDEO OF IT.\nI'M WONDERING IF YOU HAVE THAT KIND OF THING COMPARED TO A\nVIDEO OF HILLARY CLINTON CALLING, YOU KNOW, HALF OF TRUMP\nSUPPORTERS A BASKET OF DEPLORABLES.\nWHAT HAPPENS WITH THE UNDECIDED VOTERS?\nWHAT IN THIS ELECTION CYCLE, AND IT'S HARD, BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO\nCOMPARE THIS TO ANY ELECTION CYCLE.\nWHAT HAPPENS WITH UNDECIDED VOTER WHO SEE UGLINESS LIKE THIS\nON BOTH SIDES? >> WELL, THEY MAY VOTE FOR GARY\nJOHNSON, THE LIBERTARIAN OR JILL STEIN, ANOTHER PARTY CANDIDATE.\nTHEY ARE POLLING TOGETHER AT LEAST 150 PER10% OF VOTE, UNUSU\nHIGH FOR INDEPENDENTS. THE TRUTH IS, WE TALK ABOUT\nTHESE INDEPENDENTS, DEPENDS HOW YOU DEFINE THEM, BUT I WOULD\nARGUE THERE ARE ACTUALLY 10% OR LESS THAT ARE TRULY UNDECIDED.\nMAYBE EVEN MID TO LOW SINGLE DIGITS.\nMOST PEOPLE KNOW HOW THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE.\nTHEY'RE LEANING, OR THEY HAVE FIRMLY DECIDED.\nIT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO BE UNDECIDED IN THIS PARTICULAR\nELECTION. MOST PEOPLE HAVE STRONG\nFEELINGS. >> SO I WANT TO PLAY SOMETHING\nTHAT HAPPENED ON THE MORNING SHOW HERE ON CNN, ON \"NEW DAY\nTODAY,\" BECAUSE SOMETIME THIS WEEK WE'RE EXPECTING AT LEAST\nMORE INFORMATION ABOUT HEALTH, MAYBE FROM BOTH OF THE\nCANDIDATES, MAYBE HILLARY WILL RETURN TO THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\nSHE SAID SHE'LL RELEASE MORE INFORMATION.\nDONALD TRUMP SAID HE GOT ANOTHER CHECKUP FROM HIS DOCTOR AND\nPLANS TO RELEASE MORE INFORMATION AND KELLYANNE CONWAY\nWAS ASKED ABOUT THAT ORIGINAL DOCTOR'S LETTER THAT MADE SO\nMANY OUTRIGHT LAUGH, THE ASTASTON\nINGISHINGLY GOOD HEALTH RECORD. >> AS FAR AS I CAN SEE THERE ARE\nTWO MAJOR PARTY CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AND ONLY\nONE HAS PNEUMONIA AND LIED ABOUT IT, ESPECIALLY TO THE PRESS.\nSHE ALWAYS THINKS SHE, TREATS YOU ALL LIKE SECOND-CLASS PRESS\nCONFERENCES. WON'T HAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE\nAND UPLIFTS, ASPIRATIONAL AND GOES ON TO ATTACK TENS OF\nMILLIONS OF AMERICANS THE VERY NEXT DAY.\n>> WELL, THAT SORT OF MIGRATED AWAY FROM THE HEALTH QUESTION\nAND I THINK THE HEALTH QUESTION REMAINS BIG.\nJASON, THE BIG PART OF IT IS, WILL THIS END UP BEING BATTLE OF\nTHE EXPERTS? BATTLE OF THE DOCTORS?\nWHOSE DOCTOR IS MORE CREDIBLE WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT THE\nCAMPAIGNS ARE GOING TO RELEASE? >> ACTUALLY I THINK IT'S A\nMATTER, ASHLEIGH, OF VOTER PERCEPTION.\nA GENDER ASPECT, AN HON NEFRTES ASPECT.\nA LONG TIME TRUMP SURROGATES HAVE SAID HILLARY'S SICK,\nUNHEALTHY. SHE'S GOT A BODY DOUBLE.\nBASICALLY SAYING THAT THE DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGN IS \"WEEKEND\nAT BERNIE'S.\" PASSED AWAY MONTHS AGO AND\nTHEY'RE PROPPING HER UP TO WIN THE WHITE HOUSE.\nTHIS PLAYS UP TO A NOTION OF A DISHONEST FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\nTHAT WORKS FOR DONALD TRUMP. ON A PRACTICAL LEVEL, MOST DON'T\nCARE. THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T HAVE TO\nLEAD US AGAINST THE WAR OF THE VIKINGS.\nAS LONG AS IT'S NOT CANCER OR LIFE-THREATENING, I DON'T THINK\nVOTERS WILL CHANGE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.\nIF HILLARY CLINTON COLLAPSES DURING A DEBATE, THAT'S ONE\nTHING. IF SHE CAN CONTINUE TO CAMPAIGN\nIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS, I DON'T THINK IT WILL CHANGE\nANYTHING. >> JASON JOHNSON WITH THE NEW 70\nIS THE NEW 50.

THERE WAS A MAN, TRUMP SUPPORTER\nIN THE CROWD PUNCHING AND CHOKING ONE PROTESTER.\nTHAT MAN FROM WHAT WE UNDERSTAND WAS NOT ARRESTED BY AUTHORITIES,\nALTHOUGH THE PROTESTERS WERE LED OUT OF THIS VENUE.\n>> JIM ACOSTA, THANKS VERY MUCH. BACK TO THE PANEL.\nSTUART, AS MUCH AS THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, MEDIA WANTS TO PRESS\nHILLARY CLINTON ON TRANSPARENCY, SHE IS OBVIOUSLY NOW TRYING TO\nUSE WHAT HAPPENED TO HER AND POINT TO DONALD TRUMP AND SAY,\nWELL, WHAT ABOUT HIM? I'M BEING HELD TO ESSENTIALLY A\nDIFFERENT STANDARD. >> LOOK, I THINK THE LITMUS TEST\nHERE IS GOING TO BE THE TAX RETURNS.\nGOVERNOR PENCE HAS RELEASED HIS. IT REALLY IS BEHOLDEN UPON A\nMODERN CANDIDATE TO RELEASE SOME TAX RETURNS.\nYOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT DONALD TRUMP'S INVESTMENTS ARE OR HIS\nCURRENT INCOME. AND JUST THE SORT OF COMMON\nSENSE OF IT IS WHAT PEOPLE COME BACK TO.\nDONALD TRUMP IS SOMEONE WHO'S NOT AFRAID OF SAYING\nCONTROVERSIAL THINGS OR DOING CONTROVERSIAL THINGS.\nWHAT IS IT IN HIS TAX RETURNS THAT HE FINDS SO DISQUALIFYING\nTHAT HE WON'T RELEASE? SO I REALLY DON'T SEE HOW THE\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN CAN WIN AN ARGUMENT ON TRANSPARENCY UNTIL\nTHEY DO THAT. IF DONALD TRUMP WALKED OUT\nTOMORROW AND RELEASE THE FIVE YEARS OF TAX RETURNS OR EVEN TWO\nYEARS OF TAX RETURNS, I THINK THAT WOULD GIVE THEM SORT OF\nMORE OF A STANDING TO MAKE THIS CASE.\n>> GLORIA, IF DONALD TRUMP DID THAT, I MEAN, JUST -- I GET THE\nRATIONALE, THE ARGUMENT THAT HE SHOULD DO THAT, BUT IF HE DID\nTHAT, IT'S GOING TO BE A STORY FOR A WEEK AND CAN THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN AFFORD THAT, THE FOCUS TO BE ON HIS RETURNS AND\nWHATEVER THEY SHOW OR DO NOT SHOW FOR, YOU KNOW, WITH SO\nCLOSE BEFORE ELECTION DAY? I MEAN, RIGHT NOW, IT DOESN'T\nSEEM LIKE THAT HE'S WAVERING OR IS BOTHERED BY THE PRESSURE.\n>> THE LONGER THEY WOULD WAIT, THE HARDER IT GETS OBVIOUSLY AND\nOF COURSE IT DEPENDS ON WHAT'S IN THEM.\nUSUALLY CAMPAIGNS TRY TO RELEASE IT A BIT EARLIER RATHER THAN\nLATER, AND, BUT THE QUESTION IS, IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO\nHIDE, DON'T HIDE IT. YOU KNOW, THERE IS NO LAW THAT\nSAYS THAT IF YOU'RE UNDER AUDIT THAT YOU CAN'T RELEASE YOUR\nRETURNS. RICHARD NIXON DID IT, FOR\nEXAMPLE. AND I THINK SO LONG AS DONALD\nTRUMP REFUSES TO DO THAT, HILLARY CLINTON HAS A LEGITIMATE\nRIGHT TO RAISE QUESTIONS, ALL KINDS OF QUESTIONS ABOUT HIM,\nABOUT HIS TRANSPARENCY, ABOUT HIS CHARITABLE GIVING, ABOUT HIS\nINCOME, ABOUT, YOU KNOW, ALL KINDS OF THINGS THAT VOTERS MAY\nWANT TO KNOW ABOUT. I KNOW CONGRESSMAN PENCE,\nGOVERNOR PENCE, SAID TO WOLF BLITZER TODAY THAT VOTERS DON'T\nCARE ABOUT THAT, BUT ONCE THEY KNOW WHAT'S IN THEM, THEN THEY\nMIGHT CARE ABOUT IT. AND SO THE LONGER THEY WAIT, THE\nHARDER IT IS FOR DONALD TRUMP -- >> YEAH.\n>> -- TO DO IT. >> COREY, YOU AND I TALKED ABOUT\nTHIS IN THE LAST HOUR, I MEAN, AGAIN, IF YOU BELIEVE THE MY\nTAXES ARE UNDER AUDIT ARGUMENT, THEREFORE I'M NOT GOING TO\nRELEASE THEM, ACCORDING TO HIS OWN ATTORNEYS IF 2002 TO 2008,\nTHOSE RETURNS HAVE BEEN AUDITED, THE AUDIT IS DONE.\nWHY NOT RELEASE BOTH THOSE? >> LOOK, I THINK HE'S BEEN VERY\nCLEAR ABOUT RELEASING HIS INFORMATION THAT'S REQUIRED WHEN\nYOU RUN FOR PRESIDENT WHICH IS THE PERSONAL FINANCIAL\nDISCLOSURE STATEMENT WHICH MANY PUNDITS SAID HE'D NEVER FILL OUT\nBECAUSE IT WOULD SHOW HE'S NOT ACTUALLY WORTH WHAT HE SAID HE'S\nWORTH. WHAT IT ACTUALLY SHOWS IS HE HAS\n50 ENTITIES WORTH MORE THAN $50 MILLION A PIECE.\nBUT, YOU KNOW, THE ONE THING I DO WANT TO TOUCH ON, IT'S VERY\nIMPORTANT, THIS IS BARACK OBAMA'S STATEMENT.\nWE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO'S FIGHTING FOR ALL AMERICANS, NOT\nONE WHO WRITES OFF NEARLY HALF OF THE COUNTRY.\nRIGHT? THIS GOES DIRECTLY TO HILLARY\nCLINTON. WE WANT A PRESIDENT WHO'S\nFIGHTING FOR ALL AMERICANS. THIS NOTION OF DEPLORABLES WHICH\nIS WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT, SHE'S NOT FIGHTING FOR\nEVERYBODY. SHE WANTS TO BE A PRESIDENT FOR\nSOME OF THE COUNTRY. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT BARACK\nOBAMA WAS AGAINST. THAT'S WHY HE BEAT HER EIGHT\nYEARS AGO AND WHY DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO BEAT HER NOW.\n>> DO YOU GET -- YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, LET'S PLAY -- ACTUALLY\nLET ME ASK YOU FIRST BEFORE WE PLAY THIS.\nDO YOU -- DO YOU GIVE HER CREDIT AT ALL FOR APOLOGIZING JUST FOR\nSAYING, YOU KNOW WHAT, NOT HALF, I WAS WRONG TO SAY HALF.\n>> LOOK, I THINK SHE SHOULD APOLOGIZE, BUT, YOU KNOW, DOES\nTHAT MEAN IT'S A QUARTER? WHAT IS IT?\nAGAIN, KELLYANNE CONWAY WAS VERY CLEAR ABOUT THIS.\nTHESE WERE SCRIPTED REMARKS. THIS WASN'T AN AD LIB.\nTHIS WASN'T OFF THE CUFF.

IT'S TRUE.\nTHIS IS WHAT THE POLLS SAY.

SHE TALKED TODAY --\n>> THEY'RE BOTH -- I MEAN, THAT'S NOT --\n>> -- ABOUT E-MAILS. IT'S AMAZING SHE RAISED THAT\nISSUE. SHE SAID PEOPLE HAVE READ MY\nE-MAILS. THEY'VE READ NOT THE 15,000 SHE\nWITHHELD. >> THEY CERTAINLY BOTH HAVE\nISSUES ON THE QUESTION OF TRUST --\n>> THAT'S NOT EVEN THE ARGUMENT THERE.\nLOOK, THE QUESTION I HAVE IS WHEN IS DONALD TRUMP GOING TO\nDISAVOW THE PEOPLE, THE ELEMENT, RIGHT, IN HIS CAMPAIGN AND HIS\nSUPPORTERS THAT ARE DEPLORABLE? THE PEOPLE THAT WE JUST TALKED\nABOUT. THE DAVID DUKES OF THE WORLD.\n>> MIKE PENCE DID THAT TODAY. >> THE WHITE SUPREMACISTS.\n>> MIKE PENCE DID THAT TODAY AND DONALD TRUMP HAS DONE IT ON\nMULTIPLE OCCASIONS.

I NEVER SAID THAT.\nDAVID DUKE WHO IS A FORMER GRAND WIZARD OF THE KKK THAT\nTERRORIZED -- >> HE HAS SAID HE --\n>> YEAH, BUT HE IS DEPLORABLE. THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE.\nDAVID DUKE IS ACTUALLY DEPLORABLE.\nTHE KKK IS DEPLORABLE. WHITE SUPREMACY --\nROBERT BYRD APOLOGIZED.

WHAT'S GOING ON?\n>> WHEN WE SAY TRANSPARENCY, WHAT WE MEAN IS HOW MUCH DO WE\nKNOW ABOUT THESE CANDIDATES? IT CAN FEEL LIKE WE KNOW TOO\nMUCH. YET, WHEN IT COMES TO THESE KEY\nISSUES LIKE HEALTH AND TAXES, THERE'S A LOT WE DON'T KNOW.\nI THINK YOUR POINT ABOUT SELFIES IS CRUCIAL.\nCOMPARED TO 20 OR 30 OR 40 YEARS AGO, WE'RE IN A MUCH MORE OPEN\nSOCIETY. WE'RE IN A TMI, TOO MUCH\nINFORMATION, SOCIETY. THAT'S WHY THERE'S A HIGHER\nEXPECTATION ON OUR POLITICIANS AS WELL.\n>> FRANK, HOW DO YOU SEE IT? >> I SEE IT VERY MUCH THE SAME\nWAY, BUT I ALSO SEE A VERY INTERESTING THING HERE, YOU\nKNOW. IT'S VERY PARADOXICAL.\nHILLARY CLINTON IS RELUCTANT TO SHARE ALL THIS INFORMATION, VERY\nSECRETIVE BECAUSE SHE SPENT HER ENTIRE LIFE IN PUBLIC EYE AND\nHAS BEEN TAKEN APART AND THINKS THERE'S THIS VAST ANTI-CLINTON\nCONSPIRACY. SHE'S NOT WRONG ABOUT THAT.\nDONALD TRUMP DOESN'T WANT TO SHARE INFORMATION BECAUSE HE\nSPENT NO TIME IN PUBLIC LIFE, AND HE'S OWNED HIS OWN\nINFORMATION, TRIED TO BE HIS OWN PR GUY, HIS OWN PITCH GUY.\nSO FOR DIFFERENT REASONS, THEY ARE IN THIS WORLD AS THEY ARE.\nBUT BRIAN IS RIGHT. WE ARE IN THIS KIND OF BIZARRE\nPLACE WHERE EVERYTHING RICOCHETS AROUND.\nEVERYTHING BECOMES A CONSPIRACY THEORY.\nAND SOCIAL MEDIA BLOWS EVERYTHING UP IN REALTIME.\n>> SO WE HAVE TO BE MORE CRITICAL THINKERS THAN EVER\nBEFORE. THERE'S THESE CRAZY IDEAS ALL\nOVER THE WEB. THEY BOIL UP ON OUR FACEBOOK AND\nTWITTER FEEDS. EVEN IDEAS ABOUT CLINTON HAVING\nA BODY DOUBLE. THIS STUFF IS PREPOSTEROUS, YET\nIT'S ON US AS NEWS CONSUMERS NOT TO BUY INTO THAT HYPE.\nI WOULD SAY THINK ABOUT SUNDAY",

PNEUMONIA, REALLY?\nWOULD YOU HAVE GONE TO YOUR DAUGHTER'S HOUSE WITH BABIES IN\nTHE HOUSE HAVING PNEUMONIA? NO.\n>> SHE WAS ALREADY ON ANT ANTIB\nANTIBIOTICS, SHE SAYS. ARE YOU SUGGESTING SHE DIDN'T\nHAVE PNEUMONIA OR SOMETHING WORSE?\n>> I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW.\nI JUST AM SAYING AS A GRANDMOTHER, I SAW THAT AND I\nTHOUGHT, YOU WOULD GO TO THE HOUSE WITH THE BABIES IN IT IF\nYOU HAD PNEUMONIA? IF I THINK I'VE GOT A COLD, I'M\nVERY CAREFUL ABOUT HOW I INTERACT WITH MY GRAND BABIES.\n>> ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S TAXES. IS IT TIME FOR HIM TO RELEASE\nHIS TAXES? >> WELL, TRUMP HAS FILED ALL OF\nHIS FINANCIAL PAPERWORK WITH THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION.\nTHAT'S A REQUIREMENT. HE'S MET EVERY DEADLINE THERE.\nI THINK IT IS FAIR TO SAY GIVE US SOME GENERAL OUTLINES SO THAT\nWE KNOW A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THAT.\nPEOPLE ARE CURIOUS ABOUT THAT. I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE THAT MR.\nTRUMP IS GOING TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION.\n>> TO RELEASE HIS TAXES. YOU HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE HE'LL\nRELEASE HIS TAXES? >> THERE ARE AUDITS GOING ON,\nBUT I THINK THE INFORMATION THAT PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT\nMORE ABOUT, I THINK THERE ARE WAYS TOO TO DO THAT AND THAT\nFINANCIAL DISCLOSURE IS ONE OF THOSE.\nI THINK THERE WILL BE OTHERS. >> JUST BECAUSE THIS CAME UP\nTHIS MORNING ON OUR SHOW, HOW DO YOU KNOW, IN FACT, THAT HE'S\nUNDER AN AUDIT? HE HASN'T EVEN RELEASED THE\nLETTER FROM THE IRS SAYING HE'S UNDER AN AUDIT.\n>> YEAH, I HEARD YOU ALL SAYING, TALKING ABOUT THAT.\nTHAT IS A QUESTION THAT PEOPLE HAVE.\nHOW EXTENSIVE IS THE AUDIT, HOW MANY YEARS?\nI DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT. I DO KNOW THAT MANY TIMES\nINDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SELF-EMPLOYED, SMALL BUSINESSES,\nINDIVIDUALS THAT OWN PRIVATELY HELD COMPANIES, THEY DO HAVE A\nTENDENCY TO FACE MORE AUDITS AND OF COURSE THE IRS COMMISSIONER\nAT THIS POINT IN TIME HAS BEEN A LITTLE LESS THAN FAIR.\nTHAT'S WHY THERE'S DISCUSSION ABOUT IMPEACHING THE IRS\nCOMMISSIONER. >> ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH THE\nLEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS PROVIDED FOR\nHIS FINANCIALS? >> SURE.\nI THINK YOU CAN GO LOOK AT HIS FEC FILINGS AND GET A GOOD\nPICTURE OF WHAT IS THERE. >> CONGRESSWOMAN DINGELL, IS\nHILLARY CLINTON NOW GOING TO RELEASE A MORE FULSOME PICTURE\nOF HER MEDICAL RECORDS? >> MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT\nSHE'S GOING TO BE RELEASING MORE THIS WEEK.\nI HOPE THAT DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO RELEASE MORE AND LET US\nSEE THOSE RECORDS. I WOULD SAY WITH ALL DUE RESPECT\nTO MY COLLEAGUE, WHO I REALLY LIKE WORKING FOR, I DON'T THINK\nWE'RE SEEING ANYTHING FROM THE DONALD TRUMP SIDE.\nWE DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS HOLDINGS ARE.\nWE DON'T KNOW WHO HE'S DOING BUSINESS WITH.\nIF HE'S COMPLETED AUDITS IN THE PAST, GIVE US A TAX RETURN FROM\nYEARS PAST SO WE CAN SEE WHAT IT WAS AT SOME POINT.\nLET'S TREAT BOTH CANDIDATES WITH THE SAME LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY.\nTHEY BOTH NEED TO GET IT. WE CARE ABOUT EVERYTHING IN\nTHEIR LIFE. WE NEED TO SEE EVERYTHING.\nI THINK YOU SEE ONE CANDIDATE BEING MUCH MORE FORTHCOMING IN\nRELEASING RECORDS THAN WE'VE SEEN THE OTHER SIDE.\nLET'S TREAT THEM TO BOTH EQUALLY.\n>> CONGRESSWOMAN DIRNGELL, ARE YOU SATISFIED DONALD TRUMP HAS\nGIVEN TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, AS MIKE PENCE SAID, TO\nCHARITY? BECAUSE WE'RE NOT SEEING\nEVIDENCE OF THAT. >> YOU KNOW, I THINK ALL OF US\nNEED TO GIVE AT THE LEVEL WE CAN AFFORD TO.\nI DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S GIVEN BECAUSE WE WON'T MAKE HIS TAX\nRETURNS PUBLIC. WE WON'T SHOW US WHAT HE'S DONE.\nI JUST THINK THAT'S WHY I'M SAYING IF HILLARY HADN'T MADE\nHERS, WE WOULD BE SCREAMING EQUALLY.\n>> HOW ABOUT THAT, CONGRESSWOMAN BLACKBURN?\n>> MANY TIMES PEOPLE LIKE GIVING MONEY ANONYMOUSLY.\nWE DON'T KNOW WHO MR. TRUMP HAS GIVEN TO.\nI THINK JUST KNOWING AND BEING AWARE HE HAS GIVEN THIS MONEY,\nHE HAS PARTICIPATED AND SUPPORTED CHARITIES, THAT'S A\nVERY GOOD THING. >> BUT WE DON'T KNOW IF HE'S\nGIVEN HIS OWN MONEY, ACTUALLY. >> SOME OF THE STORIES OF HIS\nGENEROSITY ARE OUT AND ABOUT, ALISYN.\nI THINK THAT MORE OF THOSE WILL BE COMING OUT OVER THE NEXT 56\nDAYS AS WE APPROACH ELECTION DAY.\nOF COURSE PEOPLE LIKE TO KNOW THAT CANDIDATES GIVE BACK.\nIT'S A GOOD THING TO GIVE BACK MORE THAN YOU TAKE.\nI THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT TO SEE LEADERSHIP THAT WILL\nBEGIN TO DO THAT. WASHINGTON IS PRIMARILY -- AND\nDEBBIE AND I HAVE SEEN THIS. PEOPLE THINK OF WASHINGTON AS A\nGREEDY TOWN WHERE PEOPLE ARE ALL ABOUT THEMSELVES AND CRONYISM\nRUNS RAMPANT. SO WHAT THEY WANT IN LEADERSHIP\nIS TO UNDERSTAND A FEW THINGS, THAT YOU DO GIVE THINGS BACK,\nYOU GIVE BACK MORE THAN YOU TAKE, LEAVE THINGS IN BETTER\nT SHAPE THAN YOU.\nFOUND THEM. >> SURE.\nTHEY ALSO SEEM TO WANT TRANSPARENCY SO THEY CAN KNOW\nHOW MUCH THEIR LEADERS HAVE GIVEN.\n>> YOU'RE RIGHT. >> TAX RETURNS, THEY COULD\nREVEAL HOW MUCH HE'S GIVEN TO CHARITY BECAUSE \"THE WASHINGTON\nPOST\" SAYS THAT IN THE PAST EIGHT YEARS THAT THEY STUDIED IN\nTHEIR INVESTIGATION, THEY CAN FIND ONLY $10,000 OUT OF HIS OWN\nPOCKET. WOULD THAT BE ENOUGH,\nCONGRESSW CONGRESSWOMAN BACKBURN?\n>> I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT \"THE WASHINGTON POST\" AND THEIR\nSTORY. LET'S LEAVE THIS TO THE C\nCAMPAIGN. THAT'S A QUESTION FOR THEM.\nI KNOW MR. TRUMP HAS BEEN VERY GENEROUS WITH HIS TIME AND HIS\nABILITIES, AS HAVE HIS CHILDREN. I KNOW THE CLINTON FOUNDATION\nHAS HAD A HISTORY OF NOT REPORTING FOREIGN CONTRIBUTIONS,\nOF NOT FILING 990s, OF SPENDING ONLY 13% OF WHAT THEY BRING IN.\n>> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THEIR OWN PERSONAL DONATIONS.\n>> THAT IS THEIR FOUNDATION. >> THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE\nTRUMP FOUNDATION AND WHAT THEY'VE GIVEN TO AS WELL. CONGRESSWOMAN, THANK YOU VERY\nMUCH FOR MAKING THE CASE. >> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.\n>> YOU TOO. THANK YOU FOR MAKING THE CASE\nFOR YOUR CANDIDATES. CHRIS?\n>> UP NEXT, A DOSE OF REALITY. THESE TWO CANDIDATES ARE TWO OF\nTHE OLDEST THAT WE'VE HAD. SO WHAT SHOULD BE THE STANDARD,\nNOT THE LAW, BECAUSE WE CAN'T GET ANY LAWS PASSED RIGHT NOW,\nBUT WHAT SHOULD BE THE STANDARD?

WITH ME NOW CNN POLITICAL\nCORRESPONDENT, NIA AND AERIAL LEWIS AND DAVID SWORDLICK, THE\nEXECUTIVE EDITOR OF THE WASHINGTON POST.\nWELCOME TO ALL OF YOU. >> ALL RIGHT.\n>> ERROLL, YOU GET THE FIRST HARD QUESTION.\nIS THERE A DOUBLE STANDARD WHEN IT COMES TO TRANSPARENCY BETWEEN\nTRUMP AND CLINTON? >> OF COURSE THERE'S A DOUBLE\nSTANDARD. JUST THAT ONE LITTLE SHOCKER AT\nTHE END OF WHAT HILLARY CLINTON SAID SHOULD REALLY SET EVERYBODY\nON EDGE. 120 FOREIGN DEALS.\nDEALS WITH WHO? I MEAN, HIS MOST LUCRATIVE REAL\nESTATE DEAL I THINK ASIDE FROM TRUMP TOWER IN NEW YORK CITY IS\n40 WALL STREET. WE DON'T KNOW WHO HE CO-OWNS 40\nWALL STREET WITH. I MEAN, THIS IS REALLY, REALLY\nBASIC STUFF AND IT SHOULD BE STARTLING TO PEOPLE THAT HE WILL\nNOT TELL US WHO HE CO-OWNS BUSINESSES WITH, WHO HE OWES HIS\nESTIMATED $650 MILLION TO, HIS BUSINESSES ARE CARRYING A LOT OF\nDEBT. HE'S DOING OVER 100 FOREIGN\nDEALS AND HE WANTS TO BE BOTH THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND THE\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE WORLD FOR THE UNITED STATES.\nIT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE AS FAR AS -- YOU KNOW, I MEAN, THE DIFFERENCE\nBETWEEN TELLING SOMEBODY YOU HAD PNEUMONIA ON SUNDAY INSTEAD OF\nFRIDAY IS NOT EVEN IN THE SAME LEAGUE REALLY.\n>> WELL, DAVID, WE DO KNOW THAT CLINTON DID RELEASE HER TAXES\nFOR THE PAST 40 YEARS. WE KNOW SHE TAKES BLOOD\nTHINNERS, THAT SHE HAD A CONCUSSION, THAT SHE TAKES\nTHYROID MEDICATION. SHE EVEN TALKED TO CNN ABOUT\nMONICA LEWINSKY. WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HIS\nMEDICAL HISTORY, HIS TAX RETURNS OR HIS MARRIAGE.\nDO YOU AGREE WITH ERROLL? >> WELL, I CERTAINLY AGREE THAT\nDONALD TRUMP HAS NOT BEEN AS TRANSPARENT ABOUT HIS HEALTH\nRECORDS, RIGHT? HIS DOCTOR RELEASED THAT LETTER\nTHAT EVERYONE HAS TALKED ABOUT THAT SAID HE'S THE HEALTHIEST\nINDIVIDUAL EVER HE LEEKTED TO THE PRESIDENCY WHICH I THINK IS\nALMOST CARTOONISH IN ITS DESCRIPTION OF DONALD TRUMP.\nDONALD TRUMP SHOULD LEASE MOR ROBUST AND MORE COMPLETE HEALTH\nRECORDS. SECRETARY CLINTON SHOULD RELEASE\nMORE ROBUST AND MORE COMPLETE HEALTH RECORDS IF THAT'S WHAT\nTHE PUBLIC DEMANDS. I THINK IT'S REASONABLE FOR THE\nPUBLIC TO DEMAND THAT WHEN ANYONE SEEKS THE OFFICE OF THE\nPRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES, COMMANDER IN CHIEF, LEADER OF\nTHE FREE WORLD, IF YOU WILL. THAT SAID, I THINK THE STANDARD\nHAS TO BE APPLIED FAIRLY BOTH TO SECRETARY CLINTON AND TO DONALD\nTRUMP, WHICH IT HASN'T SO FAR. I THINK GOING FORWARD IN THE\nFUTURE THE STANDARD CAN'T BE AGEIST, RIGHT?\nJUST BECAUSE SHE'S 69 AND HE'S 70 DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULD PUT\nEXTRA SCRUTINY ON THEM. IF THE OFFICE IS THAT IMPORTANT,\nWHICH IT IS, THEN GOING FORWARD IN THE FUTURE IN 2020 IF A MUCH\nYOUNGER CANDIDATE, SENATOR RUBIO, SENATOR CRUZ RUNS WE\nSHOULD DEMAND THE SAME AMOUNT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR HEALTH\nAS WELL. >> OKAY.\nSO ON THE SUBJECT OF MRS. CLINTON'S PNEUMONIA AND DONALD\nTRUMP'S HEALTH RECORDS, KE KELLYANNE CONWAY WAS ON AND THIS\nIS WHAT SHE SAID ABOUT IT. >> ALISYN, THIS IS WHAT I EXPECT\nFROM THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN. I REALLY DON'T EXPECT IT FROM\nJOURNALISTS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HILLARY\nCLINTON AND HER PNEUMONIA AND WHAT HAPPENED ON 9/11 WHICH WE\nALL SAW WITH OUR OWN TWO EYES. IT TAKES US ABOUT TEN WORDS TO\nGET TO DONALD TRUMP. HE HAD A PHYSICAL LAST WEEK.\nHE'LL RELEASE THEM PROBABLY THIS WEEK OR WHENEVER THE DOCTOR HAS\nTHE REPORT PREPARED. >> SO I WOULD SAY THAT KELLYANNE\nCONWAY DOES NOT AGREE WITH ERROLL OR DAVID AND SHE CAN'T\nBELIEVE THEY'RE SAYING SUCH THINGS.\n>> AND WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH HIM RELEASING WHATEVER\nINFORMATION HE'S GOING TO RELEASE, THESE NUMBERS FROM HIS\nPHYSICAL. PART OF THE INFORMATION IS IT\nDOESN'T TELL YOU MUCH. IT'S JUST A SNAPSHOT OF WHATEVER\nYOUR CHOLESTEROL LEVEL IS OR WHATEVER YOUR HEART RATE IS OR\nYOUR BLOOD PRESSURE. SO THAT'S NOT GOING TO, I THINK,\nGIVE A REALLY COMPLETE PICTURE. I THINK THE STANDARD SHOULD BE\nAS DAVID SAID FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST PEOPLE WHO ARE OVER 65,\nSHOULD BE WHAT JOHN McCAIN, WE SAW HIM DO IN 2008 WHERE PEOPLE\nREALLY HAD A VERY WIDE ACCESS, REPORTERS DID, TO HIS HISTORY OF\nMEDICAL RECORDS AND THEY WERE ABLE TO POUR THROUGH THEM.\nSO THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK WE PROBABLY WON'T SEE.\nWE'LL SEE WHAT HILLARY CLINTON RELEASES IN THE NEXT DAYS, BUT I\nTHINK -- GO AHEAD. >> HERE'S THE OTHER THING THAT I\nFIND INTERESTING. THAT DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO\nAPPEAR ON THE DR. OZ SHOW ON THURSDAY.\nI GUESS THIS WAS PRE-ARRANGED. HE MAY OR MAY NOT TALK ABOUT THE\nRESULTS OF HIS PHYSICAL. THIS IS WHAT DR. OZ SAID ABOUT\nMR. TRUMP'S APPEARANCE YESTERDAY.\n>> HE'S COMING ON THE SHOW, AND I -- YOU KNOW, I KNOW THAT THIS\nHAS BECOME A BIG ISSUE FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES.\nI'VE INVITED BOTH. I KNOW THAT BOTH CANDIDATES ARE\nTALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THEIR HEALTH ISSUES BUT BECAUSE IT'S\nCOME UP IN A BIG CHARGED TOPIC, I THINK IT MAKES SENSE FOR THEM\nTO TALK ABOUT IT. I'M NOT TRYING TO PRY OR PROBE,\nI'M TRYING TO HEAR WHAT'S GOING ON IN THEIR LIVES.\n>> ERROLL, IS THAT A GOOD FORUM FOR DONALD TRUMP TO TALK ABOUT\nHIS HEALTH? BY THE WAY, HIS DAUGHTER IVANKA\nIS GOING TO APPEAR WITH HIM ON THE DR. OZ SHOW.\n>> I DON'T THINK IT'S THE RIGHT FORUM.\nNO DISRESPECT TO DR. OZ WHO PROBABLY MAKES MORE ON THIS SHOW\nTHAN ALL OF US COMBINED BUT I THINK WE JUST SAW IN THE MOST\nRECENT COMMANDER IN CHIEF FORUM WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEONE WHO IS\nNOT AN EXPERIENCED INVESTIGATIVE OR POLITICAL REPORTER TAKES A\nWHACK AT TRYING TO SORT OF GET INFORMATION OUT OF PEOPLE WHO\nARE TRYING TO BE EVASIVE. AND POLITICIANS, ESPECIALLY WHEN\nTHE STAKES ARE HIGH AS THEY ARE RIGHT NOW, CAN BE QUITE EVASIVE.\nI WOULD NOT EXPECT DR. OZ TO ASK THE RIGHT KINDS OF QUESTIONS TO\nGET TO THE BOTTOM OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE.\nAND UNFORTUNATELY I WOULD EXPECT HIM TO GET STEAM ROLLED, TO HAVE\nA BUNCH OF UNCHALLENGED ASSERTIONS TO COME OUT OF THE\nMOUTH OF THE CANDIDATE AND THEN WE'RE LEFT WITH MORE CONFUSION\nAND LESS INFORMATION THAN EVER. I MEAN, I HOPE DR. OZ'S\nPRODUCERS ARE WATCHING THIS AND MAYBE KNOW THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE\nARE RELYING ON THEM TO CARRY SOME IMPORTANT WEIGHT FOR THE\nPUBLIC WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING SOME REALLY IMPORTANT CHOICES IN\nTHE NEXT 50 DAYS. >> SO, DAVID, I CAN HEAR TRUMP\nSUPPORTERS SAYING THINGS LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT, HILLARY CLINTON'S\nTHE ONE WHO GOT SICK ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND SHE GOT\nPNEUMONIA. DONALD TRUMP SEEMS TO BE GOING\nSTRONG. SO WHY ARE WE ALL MAKING SUCH A\nBIG DEAL OF HIM RELEASING HIS MEDICAL RECORDS?\n>> WELL, WE'RE MAKING A BIG DEAL OUT OF IT AGAIN BECAUSE OF WHAT\nWE'VE ALL BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS, THAT\nTHE POSITION OF PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS TOO IMPORTANT\nFOR THE PUBLIC NOT TO HAVE AN IDEA OF THIS PHYSICALLY AND\nMENTALLY FOR ANY OF THE CANDIDATES TO BE ABLE TO DO THE\nJOB OF COMMANDER IN CHIEF IF THEY'RE ELECTED.\nIN TERMS OF THE STANDARD BEING HELD TO SECRETARY CLINTON, THERE\nARE ANY NUMBER OF ISSUES WHERE YOU COULD CRITICIZE SECRETARY\nCLINTON ON THE ISSUE OF TRANSPARENCY.\nTHE WAY SHE TALKED ABOUT THE MISHANDLING OF HER E-MAILS, SOME\nOF THE ISSUES SURROUNDING THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nI HAPPEN TO THINK THE ISSUE OF HER PNEUMONIA IS RELATIVELY LOW\nDOWN ON THAT LIST. A LOT OF JOURNALISTS DISAGREE\nAND REASONABLE MINDS CAN DISAGREE.\nIF SHE GETS A DIAGNOSIS ON FRIDAY THAT SAYS SHE HAS\nPNEUMONIA AND MAKES A DECISION TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE DEBATE, TWO\nMONTHS BEFORE THAT SHE WANTS TO POWER THROUGH AND GO THROUGH THE\n9/11 MEMORIAL, SHE'S ENTITLED TO MAKE THAT DECISION.\nONCE SHE HAD THAT EPISODE AND SHE HAD TO TO GO CHELSEA\nCLINTON'S APARTMENT, YES, IT'S IMPORTANT TO DISCLOSE WHY.\nPEOPLE ARE ASKING AND THEY WANT TO KNOW.\nTHEY CAME OUT A LITTLE TOO LATE TO BE FULLY TRANS PARENT.\nTHEY FIRST SAID SHE WAS OVER HEATED BUT EVENTUALLY SAYING SHE\nHAD PNEUMONIA IF, IN FACT, THAT IS ALL THAT'S AT ISSUE HERE,\nTHEN I THINK THE LESSON LEARNED IS MORE TRANSPARENCY AND MOVE\nFORWARD. >> ALL RIGHT.\nNIA-MALIKA, YOU'RE GOING TO JOIN",

THEIR SOBER TONE ADDS TO THE\nSERIOUSNESS OF THE ISSUE, OF COURSE.\nI DON'T THINK THAT'S BY MISTAKE.

I THINK HE'S SITTING ON HIS\niPHONE FOR THE LAST 24 HOURS, AND THAT'S A REALLY GOOD THING\nBECAUSE I AM SURE HE IS TEMPTED TO SAY SOMETHING SNARKY ABOUT\nHER HEALTH AND THE BEST THAT HE CAN SAY IS THAT HE WISHES HER A\nFULL AND SPEEDY RECOVERY.

GETTING HEALTHY IS OBVIOUS.\nIF I CAN JUST SAY, AS SOMEONE WHO COMPLETELY LACKS MEDICAL\nCREDENTIALS, IF I HAD A FAMILY MEMBER THAT I WAS DRIVING IN A\nMINIVAN WHO STUMBLED INTO THE VAN THE WAY SHE DID, I WOULD NOT\nHAVE BEEN DRIVING TO A DAUGHTER'S APARTMENT IN CHELSEA.\nI WOULD HAVE BEEN DRIVING TO AT LEAST A PHYSICIAN'S OFFICE AND\nPROBABLY AN E.R. I CAN'T HELP BUT SAYING BUT FOR\nTHAT ARE VIDEO, WOULD WE KNOW ANY OF THIS?\nAND FINALLY WITH REGARD TO HER, SHE'S GOT TO MOBILIZE THOSE\nCONSTITUENCIES THAT BARACK OBAMA DOES SO WELL WITH.\nTODAY HE'S IN MY HOMETOWN OF PHILADELPHIA.\nNO DOUBT WITH THAT SPECIFIC GOAL IN MIND.\n>> I HAVE A QUESTION. >> GO AHEAD.\nTHE MOVE BY TRUMP TO PLAY TO ADVANTAGE THE DEPLORABLE\nCOMMENT, NO QUESTION SHE OVERREACHED BY SAYING 50%.\nSHE'S ADMITTED THAT.

SO I BETTER BE CAREFUL.\nI THINK WHAT REALLY IS HAPPENING IS THAT HE GETS TO MOTIVATE HIS\nBAITS, BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT HE NECESSARILY GROWS IT WITH THAT\nCOMMENT. BUT THAT IS THE ULTIMATE WAY FOR\nHER TO HAVE STOKED HIS CONSTITUENCY TO COME OUT ON\nELECTION DAY. DOES IT MOVE THE NEEDLE WITH\nANYBODY ELSE? I DON'T KNOW.\nON RADIO SO FAR, IT'S A RORSCHACH TEST.\nPEOPLE WHO ARE FOR HER SAY, YEAH, SHE WAS RIGHT.\nPEOPLE FOR HIM SAY, HOW DARE SHE SAY THAT.\n>> I WANT TO GET BACK TO HER PNEUMONIA FOR A SECOND, MICHAEL,\nBECAUSE YOU BROUGHT THAT UP. ARE WE, AS VOTERS, ENTITLED TO\nKNOW ON FRIDAY THAT SHE HAD PNEUMONIA?\n>> ABSOLUTELY. IN MY OPINION.\nHER YALE LAW SCHOOL CLASSMATE WAS LANNIE DAVIS.\nHE WROTE A GREAT BOOK ABOUT CRISIS MANAGEMENT WITH THREE\nMANTRA IN IT, WHICH WAS TO SAY TELL IT EARLY, TELL IT ALL, AND\nTELL IT YOURSELF. SHE'S VIOLATED THAT CODA.\nI DON'T KNOW HOW SHE MADE IT THROUGH THAT INTERVIEW WITH\nCHRIS, BY THE WAY. BUT THEN TO SET UP THE SCENARIO\nWHERE ON FRIDAY WE ALL LEARNED THE DETAILS AND NOT UNTIL HOURS\nAFTER. SHE'S HER OWN WORST ENEMY IN\nCIRCUMSTANCES LIKE THIS. AND WHAT IT DOES IS REINFORCES\nTHE LIABILITIES THAT HER CAMPAIGN POSSESSES ABOUT LACK OF\nTRUSTWORTHINESS. BY THE WAY, ONE FINAL POINT.\nEVERYTHING SHE SAID TO ANDERSON LAST NIGHT ABOUT TRUMP IS TRUE.\nHE OUGHT TO RELEASE HIS TAXES. HE OUGHT TO RELEASE HIS HEALTH\nRECORDS. THEY BOTH SHOULD.\n>> SO WHY DOESN'T SHE GO THE FULL BERNSTEIN?\nWE HAD CARL BERNSTEIN ON THE SHOW.\nHE SAYS THE REMEDY FOR HILLARY AND WHAT WOULD HURT TRUMP THE\nMOST IS GO FULL TRANSPARENCY. HOLD THESE PRESS CONFERENCES OUT\nTHE WAZOO. GIVE THE SPEECHES FROM WALL\nSTREET. GIVE EVERYTHING AND SHOW THIS IS\nTHE KIND OF PRESIDENT I'LL BE. THE SUSPICION IS YOU CAN'T TRUST\nME. HERE.\nHERE'S EVERYTHING. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW, AND\nI'LL GIVE IT TO YOU. TRUMP WON'T.\nWHY DOESN'T SHE PLAY IT THAT WAY IF YOU'RE GOING TO ASK THEM TO\nDO IMPOSSIBLE THINGS? >> FIRST OF ALL, I LIKE CARL'S\nADVICE. I AGREE WITH IT.\nI THINK IT RUNS CONTRARY TO HER DNA AND PROBABLY TO HIS AS WELL,\nMEANING BILL'S. THEY REALLY ARE OF A MIND SET\nTHERE'S A VAST RIGHT-WING CONSPIRACY.\nPART OF THAT IS TRUE. THERE IS, BUT IT GETS FUELED BY\nTHE WAY IN WHICH THEY HANDLE THESE SORT OF CIRCUMSTANCES.\nI THINK THAT'S PROBABLY A BRILLIANT STRATEGY THAT SHE\nIMMEDIATELY NOW BE FORTHCOMING WITH EVERYTHING AND SHINE THE\nSPOTLIGHT BACK ON HIM. >> ALL RIGHT, MICHAEL.\nTHANKS. ALWAYS GREAT TO GET YOUR TAKE ON\nALL OF THIS. THANKS FOR BEING HERE.\n>> SO LET'S GO INTO THIS IDEA THAT MICHAEL WAS TEEING UP FOR\nUS HERE ABOUT THE TRANSPARENCY AND THE NATURE OF THESE\nCANDIDATES. LET'S LOOK AT IT IN THE CONTEXT\nOF HISTORY. THERE'S NO QUESTION THERE'S\nSTILL MAJOR QUESTIONS ABOUT BOTH TRUMP AND CLINTON.\nARE THEY GOING TO BE MORE OPEN AFTER THE SCRUTINY OF THIS WEEK?\nTWO OF THEIR SUPPORTERS FROM CONGRESS ARE GOING TO DEBATE\nWHETHER OR NOT THESE TWO ARE THE LEAST TRANSPARENT CANDIDATES\nWE'VE EVER HAD.",

WELCOME TO \"LEGAL VIEW.\"\nIF YOU THINK YOU'VE SEEN IT ALL IN THE 2016 RACE FOR PRESIDENT,\nA RACE WITH JUST 56 DAYS REMAINING, WE GOT NEWS FOR YOU.\nLITERALLY ON CNN. YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IT ALL.\nTHE NEXT HOUR YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A FIRST.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA CAMPAIGNING SOLO FOR THE WOMAN HE DEARLY HOPES\nWILL SUCCEED HIM IN THE BATTLEGROUND STATE OF\nPENNSYLVANIA. DONALD TRUMP WILL SPEAK FOR\nHIMSELF. NEXT HOUR, IN THE BATTLEGROUND\nSTATE OF IOWA. TONIGHT JOINED BY HIS DAUGHTER\nIVANKA, WHILE HILLARY CLINTON IS GOING TO SPEND YET ANOTHER DAY\nNURSING THE PNEUMONIA THAT TRUMP CAMP MANAGED TO USE AGAINST HER,\nWHILE PUBLICLY SENDING THEIR VERY BEST WISHES FOR A SPEEDY\nRECOVERY. MY CNN COLLEAGUE JASON CARROLL\nSON THE OUTSKIRTS OF DES MOINES WHERE DONALD TRUMP IS DUE TO\nSPEAK ABOUT 1:00 EASTERN TIME AND JEFF ZELENY IS HERE WITH ME\nLIVE IN NEW YORK. JEFF, SPEAKING WITH YOU FIRST,\nBECAUSE WE ARE NOW DAY TWO OF A THE TRAIL AND 56 DAYS TO GO, YOU\nDON'T WANT TO BE OFF THE TRAIL, YOU DON'T.\nDEFINITELY SHE HAS A SCHEDULE AND IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER SHE\nWAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN LOS ANGELES TODAY RAISING MONEY AND\nBILL CLINTON IS FILLING IN FOR HER DOING THAT.\nSHE IS I'M TOLD, SPEND TIME PREPARING FOR THE DEBATE IN 13\nDAYS. I DON'T THINK IT'S AS MUCH OF A\nCRISIS TO HAVE HER OFF THE TRAIL AT THIS MOMENT AS THEY TRY AND\nDEAL WITH THIS TRANSPARENCY. THE BIGGER QUESTION, WORRIES\nINSIDE HER CAMPAIGN THAT THIS IS SORT OF CREATED SOMETHING THAT\nTHEY THOUGHT THEY'D COOLED DOWN. THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT HER\nTRANSPARENCY AND HER HONESTY AND THING, BUT THEY ARE TRYING TO\nFIGURE OUT HOW TO GET HER BACK ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\n>> WHEN? >> HEALTH IS ACTUALLY A SERIOUS\nCONCERN. I WAS HEARING POTENTIALLY COULD\nBE ON THE ROAD AS EARLY AS TOMORROW, POSSIBLY IN\nPHILADELPHIA. NOW, IT MAY BE LATER IN THE\nWEEK. SHE'S DEFINITELY AT LEAST\nSCHEDULED TO BE IN WASHINGTON FOR A CONGRESSIONAL HISPANIC\nCAUCUS DINNER THURSDAY AND SPEAKING AGAIN IN WASHINGTON\nFRIDAY, BUT SHE ACTUALLY IS FOLLOWING DOCTORS' ORDERS, OR AT\nLEAST UNDER THEM AND HAS NOT GONON A GREEN LIGHT TO GO AHEAD\nAND START CAMPAIGNING AGAIN. >> JASON CARROLL, YESTERDAY\nMIGHT HAVE BEEN WHAT SOME WOULD CALL A BIT OF A GIFT FOR THE\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON TOOK IT ON THE CHIN FOR\nTRANSPARENCY, ALL THE WHILE, PESKY QUESTIONS ABOUT TAX\nRETURNS HAVE NOT BEEN ANSWERED, OR HAVE BEEN ANSWERED IN A WAY\nTHAT SEEM UNSATISFYING TO SOME. I WANT TO PLAY FOR YOU, JASON,\nIF I CAN, MIKE PENCE, TRUMP'S RUNNING MATE, GRILLED BY WOLF\nBLITZER ABOUT THE TAX RETURNS, AND ABOUT THE RELEASE OF THE TAX\nRETURNS. HERE'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY TO\nWOLF. >> I THINK THE COMMITMENT DONALD\nTRUMP HAS MADE IS ONCE THE ROUTINE AUDIT IS DONE HE'LL\nRELEASE THE TAX RETURNS IN TOTALITY AND NOT PARCH THEM OUT\nPIECE BY PIECE AS YOU MIGHT SUGGEST.\n>> THE QUESTION, WHY ISN'T HE LIVING UP TO THE MIKE PENCE\nSTANDARD? >> WELL, DONALD TRUMP MADE IT\nVERY CLEAR. HE HAS LIVED IN THE PUBLIC EYE A\nLONG TIME, IS FULLY TRANSPARENT ABOUT HIS FINANCIAL DEALINGS AS\nTHE LAW REQUIRES, IN HIS FEDERAL FILINGS, AND THOSE TAX RETURNS\nWILL BE OUT WHEN THAT ROUTINE AUDIT IS DONE.\n>> FULLY TRANSPARENT IN HIS FINANCIAL DEALINGS AS THE LAW\nREQUIRES, JASON, BUT NOT AS TRADITIONAL CAMPAIGNING\nREQUIRES. ARE THEY AVOIDING THIS QUESTION\nOUT THERE WHERE YOU ARE, OR ARE YOU ABLE TO GET CLOSE ENOUGH TO\nTHAT COMPLAIN TO PRESS CONSTANTLY ON TAX RETURNS?\n>> Reporter: LOOK, BE CLEAR. TRUMP, FOR HIS PART HARKS SAID\nREPEATEDLY CLINTON IS THE ONE NOT TRANSPARENT, NOT TRANSPARENT\nABOUT HER HEALTH. NOT TRANSPARENT ABOUT HER\nE-MAILS. BUT, LOOK, AS YOU KNOW, HE HAS\nTAKEN HEAT HIMSELF FOR NOT RELEASING HIS TAX RETURNS AND\nSAID REPEATEDLY HE'S NOT GOING TO DO IT BECAUSE HE'S UNDER IRS\nAUDIT, THOUGH THE IRS MADE IT CLEAR BECAUSE YOU'RE UNDER AUDIT\nTHAT DOES NOT PREVENT YOU FROM RELEASING RETURNS.\nWHEN YOU SPEAK TO FOLKS HERE, I HAVE TO SOME, SOME FEEL THIS IS\nIMPORTANT. IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF\nTRANSPARENCY FOR TRUMP TO DO THIS.\nPENCE HAS SAID REPEATEDLY THAT THIS IS NOT REALLY AN ISSUE WITH\nVOTERS AT LARGE, AND I HAVE TO SAY, IN SPEAKING TO A NUMBER OF\nFOLKS OUT HERE, EVEN THOUGH SOME SAY HE SHOULD RELEASE HIS TAX\nRETURNS, THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF FOLKS, TRUMP\nSUPPORTERS, WHO SAY THEY DON'T REALLY FEEL AS THOUGH IT'S\nIMPORTANT. MORE FOCUSED ON THINGS LIKE THE\nECONOMY, NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES, DEALING WITH THINGS LIKE\nTHAT, OR EVEN HEALTH CARE. SO I DON'T THINK THIS IS\nSOMETHING THAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN ULTIMATELY, ASHLEIGH,\nIS GOING TO BUDGE ON. IT'S NOT AN ISSUE THEY ARE GOING\nTO ADDRESS, EVEN THOUGH THE PRESS BRINGS IT UP.\nI WOULD NOT LOOK FOR DONALD TRUMP TO RELEASE TAX RETURNS\nANYTIME SOON. >> THE FOLKS IN THE ROOM MAY NOT\nCARE ABOUT THEM, BUT THE FOLKS IN THE BIG AMERICAN ROOM DO CARE\nABOUT THEM TO THE TUNE OF 74% OF VOTERS POLLED WANT TO SEE THEM.\nBREAK IT DOWN TO REPUBLICANS, MAYBE DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTER,\n62% OF REPUBLICANS WANT TO SEE THE TAX RETURNS.\nHOLD ON, JASON, BECAUSE THIS AND THAT AND THE TIT FOR TAT IS\nGOING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THESE CAMPAIGNS AND WHILE\nHILLARY CLINTON IS IN BED TRYING TO GET BETTER, PRESIDENT OBAMA\nAND HER DAUGHTER CHELSEA AND HUSBAND BILL ARE THE ONES WHO\nARE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE TO THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND TALK TO THE\nREAL PEOPLE OUT THERE AND DO SOME OF THAT WORK FOR HER, AND\nIN THAT EFFORT, THE HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS ALSO\nRELEASED AN AD, AND IT'S ANSWERING TO DONALD TRUMP SAYING\nTO HER THAT WHEN YOU CALL PEOPLE A BASKET OF DEPLORABLES, WELL\nHILLARY CLINTON'S AD IS SUGGESTING HERE'S WHAT YOU'VE\nCALLED PEOPLE. HAVE A LOOK. \u00e2\u0099\u00aa\n>> HOW STUPID ARE THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY?\n>> WE'RE BUILDING A WALL. HE'S A MEXICAN.\n>> YOU GOT TO SEE THIS GUY, AH -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SAID.\nAH -- I DON'T REMEMBER! >> YOU'RE LIVING IN POVERTY.\nYOUR SCHOOLS ARE NO GOOD. YOU HAVE NO JOBS.\n>> WHAT THE -- >> JEFF ZELENY, AS SHE GETS\nPREPARED TO HEAD BACK ON THE TRAIL, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, OR\nWHICH SHE'S WELL ENOUGH TO DO SO, HOW DO HER SURROGATES, THOSE\nCHIEF SURROGATES, PRESIDENT OBAMA, HER DAUGHTER, HER\nHUSBAND, HOW DO THEY TAKE THIS MESSAGE?\nBECAUSE THIS IS UGLY STUFF. >> NO DOUBT.\nAND THEY'RE DOING IT TODAY. SHE IS UP ON THE AIR IN\nBATTLEGROUND STATES, SOMETHING TRUMP IS NOT.\nYES, PROBABLY PREFER TO BE OUT CAMPAIGNING.\nIF THERE OR NOT, THAT AD IS RUNNING AND THEY'RE TRYING TO\nMAKE DNT'S OLD WORDS THE SOUND TRACK OF THIS CAMPAIGN.\nCHELSEA CLINTON HAS TWO EVENTS. PRESIDENT OBAMA MORE\nSIGNIFICANTLY THAN ANYONE DOING A SOLO EVENT IN PHILADELPHIA.\nGUESS WHY PHILADELPHIA? IT'S FOUR WEEKS FROM TODAY WHERE\nVOTER REGISTRATION ENDS. TRYING TO FIRE UP THAT OBAMA\nCOALITION, NOT AS EXCITED FOR HILLARY CLINTON AS IT WAS FOR\nHIM. WHY MICHELLE OBAMA IS GOING OUT\nON THE ROAD AS WELL ON FRIDAY. IT REALLY TAKE AS VILLAGE, TO\nUSE HER EXPRESSION, AND SHE'S TRYING TO USE THAT DEMOCRATIC\nVILLAGE TO SORT OF BUILD HER UP HERE, BUT THAT AD -- IS A\nCENTRAL SIGN YET AGAIN THAT DONALD TRUMP CAN SAY WHATEVER HE\nWANTS NOW. THE WORDS HE SAID UP TO THIS\nPOINT ARE REVERBERATING, AT LEAST THEY HOPE THEY WILL BE.\n>> JEFF ZELENY, KEEP AN EYE ON THINGS.\nIF YOU GET A BREAK ON THE DATA WE'LL BREAK IN AND COVER THAT.\nJASON CARROLL AS WELL DOING A JOB FOR US ON THE TRUMP CAMP.\nAPPRECIATE THAT. I WANT TO TALK MORE ABOUT THE\nWHOLE TRANSPARENCY THING, BECAUSE IT SPEAKS TO BOTH OF\nTHESE CAMPAIGNS AND I GOT THE THINK TANK FOR THIS.\nCNN POLITICS REPORTER STEPHEN WITH ME AND PROFESSOR IN\nPOLITICS EDITOR AT THE ROOT.COM JASON JOHNSON IS HERE AND FROM\nCHARLOTTESVILLE, VIRGINIA, DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR\nPOLITICS AT UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, LARRY SALVEBATOW WHO W\nAS THING OR TWO ABOUT POLLING FOR THE PRESIDENCY.\nMY COLLEAGUE ANDERSON KEEPER HAD A NICE EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH\nHILLARY CLINTON AS SHE WAS RECUPERATING BUT DIDN'T GO EASY\nON HER ON THE DELAY OF REVEALING THIS PNEUMONIA ISSUE.\nSPEAK WHAT'S YOU HAVE BEEN WRITING ABOUT, THE TRANSPARENCY\nPROBLEM. HAVE A LISTEN TO ANDERSON'S\nQUESTION. >> DOESN'T YOUR HANDLING -- OF\nTHIS, IN YOUR CAMPAIGNS, YOU KNOW, REFUSAL TO ACKNOWLEDGE\nWHAT HAPPENED UNTIL REALLY AFTER THAT VIDEO WAS CIRCULATED\nCONFIRM SUSPICION TO VOTERS YOU'RE NOT TRANSPARENT OR\nTRUSTWORTHY? >> OH, MY GOODNESS, ANDERSON.\nYOU KNOW, COMPARE EVERYTHING YOU KNOW ABOUT ME WITH MY OPPONENT.\nI THINK IT'S TIME HE MET THE SAME LEVEL OF DISCLOSURE THAT I\nHAVE FOR YEARS. YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT A MEDICAL\nREPORT ON ME THAT MEETS THE SAME STANDARD AS MITT ROMNEY AND\nBARACK OBAMA. DONALD TRUMP'S DOCTOR SAID HE'D\nBE THE HEALTHIEST PRESIDENT IN HISTORY.\nTHAT'S NOT EVEN SERIOUS. AND I'VE RELEASED NEARLY 40\nYEARS OF TAX RETURNS. HE HASN'T RELEASED ONE.\nTHIS IS A MAN WITH UNKNOWN NUMBERS, OF PARTNERS AND\nINVESTORS, WHO SAYS HE'S DOING 120 FOREIGN DEALS.\nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE TO KNOW WHAT HE'S UP TO AND WHAT HE\nIS HIDING. >> SO STEPHEN, THIS IS HARD\nSTUFF TO MEASURE, BUT IF ONE WOULD HAVE TO MEASURE IT, DOES\nDID ONLY GO THROUGH THE PRISM OF WHO YOUR GUY IS, OR CAN THIS BE\nMEASURED, CAMPAIGNED OUT GET TO WHO'S BEING LESS TRANSPARENT?\n>> ULTIMATELY UP TO THE CAMPAIGNS TO DISCLOSE.\nHILLARY CLINTON IS CORRECT. SHE HAS ISSUED MORE FINANCIAL\nINFORMATION THAN DONALD TRUMP, HAS ISSUED MORE MEDICAL\nINFORMATION THAN DONALD TRUMP. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS THAT,\nYOU KNOW, SHE'S NOT PERHAPS THE BEST MESSENGER FOR THAT MESSAGE.\nWE KNOW FROM THE POLLS AND HER OWN POLITICAL HISTORY VOTERS DO\nHAVE PROBLEMS WITH HER HONESTY. THEY BELIEVE SHE IS NOT SOMEONE\nTHAT ALWAYS COMES FORWARD AND DISCLOSES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.\nTHAT'S WHY IT'S A DIFFICULT POLITICAL ISSUE TO GAME OUT.\nYOU KNOW, IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THIS UNFORTUNATE HEALTH INCIDENT\nWITH HILLARY CLINTON, WE COULD BE HEADING INTO THIS ELECTION\nWITH A MEDICAL STATEMENT FROM HILLARY CLINTON, WHICH IS MORE\nTHAN A YEAR OLD, HER TAX RETURNS GRANTED, BUT A LAUGHABLY SORT OF\nCONCISE STATEMENT ON DONALD TRUMP'S MEDICAL HISTORY FROM HIS\nDOCTORS AND NO TAX RETURNS. THAT WOULD BE UNPRECEDENTED.\n>> SO, LARRY, I WANT TO BRING YOU IN ON THIS WITH NUMBERS, IF\nI CAN. I'M SURE YOU LISTENED IN TO THE\nINTERVIEW WITH OUR CORRESPONDENTS PRIOR TO THIS,\nAND YOU KNOW, JASON CARROLL NAILED IT.\nHE SAID, NO ONE IN THIS HALL REALLY SEEMS TO CARE ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP'S FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY.\nTHOSE TAX RETURNS, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE ACTUAL POLLING, I\nSAID IT BEFORE. I'M GOING TO SAY IT AGAIN.\n74% OF ALL VOTERS ASKED SAY THEY DO WANT TO SEE THOSE TAX RETURNS\nAND AMONG THOSE, 62% OF REPUBLICANS ASKED, SAID THEY\nWANT TO SEE THOSE TAX RETURNS. CAN DONALD TRUMP IGNORE THOSE\nWIDER NUMBERS? I DON'T THINK THAT MAN LIVES IN\nTHE BUBBLE OF HIS ARENA THAT LOVE HIM?\nCAN HE IGNORE OR BULLY OR CAMPAIGN HIS WAY OUT OF THOSE\nNUMBERS? >> WELL, HE MIGHT DO JUST THAT.\nTHE TRAGEDY IS THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS BROKEN A 40-YEAR PACT THAT\nCANDIDATES HAVE HAD WITH THE AMERICAN ELECTORATE TO RELEASE\nAT LEAST SOME OF THEIR TAX RETURNS, AND THOSE RETURNS ARE\nCRITICAL TO UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT A CANDIDATE HAS DONE, WHAT\nA CANDIDATE'S VALUES ARE. WHO A CANDIDATE, PERHAPS, IS\nINDEBTED TO. THERE ARE LOTS OF PIECES THAT\nCOME INTO FOCUS WHEN YOU HAVE THOSE TAX RETURNS.\nWHAT DEPRESSES ME, THAT 74% NUMBER, OR WHATEVER IT WAS,\nOUGHT TO BE 100%, BECAUSE SOONER OR LATER, THE REPUBLICANS ARE\nGOING TO FIND THEY'LL BE A DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE WHO WILL CITE\nTHE DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENT, PRECEDENT, AND WON'T RELEASE HIS\nOR HER TAX RETURNS. >> ALL RIGHT.\nSTAND BY, IF YOU WILL. WHEN WE COME BACK, JASON, I'M\nGOING TO ASK YOU SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE HEALTH REQUIREMENTS,\nAND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SAID.\nWE PUT IT TO THE CAMPAIGN TODAY ABOUT THAT DOCTOR'S LETTER THAT\nCAME FROM THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, SAYING THINGS LIKE, DONALD'S\nHEALTH IS ASTONISHINGLY EXCELLENT AND HE'D BE THE\nHEALTHIEST PERSON EVER ELECTED PRESIDENT.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE HAD A GOOD CHUCKLE OVER THAT.\nYOU SHOULD HEAR WHAT THE CAMPAIGN HAS TO SAY ABOUT ALL OF\nTHOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE LAUGHING.",

THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH ME.\nMOMENTS AGO PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA INJECTED HIS FAMOUS \"YES\nWE CAN\" TO HELP HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN SPEAKING IN\nPHILA PHILADELPHIA.\nTHIS IS HIS FIRST SOLO CAMPAIGN APPEARANCE STUMPING FOR THE\nDEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE IN THE KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE OF\nPENNSYLVANIA, A STATE HE NOTED CLINTON WON.\nHE SAID CLINTON WHOOPED HIM BUT HE WAS ABLE TO WIN IT IN\nNOVE NOVEMBER.\n>> WHEN WE SEE FOLKS TALKING ABOUT TRANSPARENCY, YOU WANT TO\nDEBATE TRANSPARENCY? YOU'VE GOT ONE CANDIDATE IN THIS\nRACE WHO'S RELEASED DECADES WORTH OF HER TAX RETURNS.\n[ APP [ APPLAUSE ]\nTHE OTHER CANDIDATE IS THE FIRST IN DECADES WHO REFUSES TO\nRELEASE ANY AT ALL. [ BOOS ]\nYOU WANT TO DEBATE FOUNDATIONS AND CHARITIES?\nONE CANDIDATE'S FAMILY FOUNDATION HAS SAVED COUNTLESS\nLIVES AROUND THE WORLD. [ APPLAUSE ]\nTHE OTHER CANDIDATE'S FOUNDATION TOOK MONEY OTHER PEOPLE GAVE TO\nHIS CHARITY AND THEN BOUGHT A SIX-FOOT MORE TALL PAINTING OF\nHIMSELF. [ LAUGHTER ]\nHEED THAT TASTE NOT TO GO FOR THE TEN-FOOT VERSION.\n[ LAUGHTER ] YOU WANT TO DEBATE WHO'S MORE\nFIT TO BE OUR PRESIDENT? ONE CANDIDATES WHO'S TRAVELED TO\nMORE COUNTRIES THAN EVERY SECRETARY OF STATE EVER HAS HAS\nMORE QUALIFICATIONS THAN PRETTY MUCH ANYONE WHO'S EVER RUN FOR\nTHIS JOB AND THE OTHER WHO ISN'T FIT IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM\nTO REPRESENT THIS COUNTRY ABROAD AND BE ITS COMMANDER IN CHIEF.\nAS THINGS BECOME SO PARTISAN, OUR STANDARDS FOR WHAT'S NORMAL\nHAVE CHANGED. >> MICHELLE KOSINSKI, A LOT OF\nECHOES OF '80 AND '12, YES, WE CAN, DON'T BOO, VOTE.\nTRYING TO GET EVERYONE OUT THERE, GET FOLKS ENTHUSIASTIC\nESPECIALLY MILLENNIALS WHO DIDN'T VOTE LAST GO AROUND.\n>> YOU KNOW WHAT'S INTERESTING? OFTEN YOU COULD SAY LOOKING AT\nCAMPAIGN EVENTS THAT THEY MIGHT ALL KIND OF SOUND THE SAME AFTER\nA WHILE AND EVEN ELECTION TO ELECTION THAT IT'S A LOT OF THE\nSAME KINDS OF CONCEPTS. BUT PRESIDENT OBAMA EVEN\nACKNOWLEDGED THIS ELECTION HAS BEEN SO DIFFERENT AND HERE WE\nARE AT THE FOOT OF THE ART MUSEUM STEPS MADE FAMOUS IN THE\nMOVIE \"ROCKY\" AND HE CAME OUT SWINGING AND HARDER THAN WE\nEXPECTED SO HE'S NOT ONLY FIGHTING FOR HILLARY CLINTON,\nWHICH IS WHAT WE EXPECTED THIS TO BE, BUT HE'S SWINGING AGAINST\nDONALD TRUMP AND HARD. USING WORDS LIKE \"CRAZY.\nHE SAID \"YOU OFTEN HEAR CRAZY THINGS DURING AN ELECTION YEAR\nBUT THIS YEAR HAS BEEN MORE CRAZY.\"\nHE'S USED PHRASES LIKE \"REALITY SHOW\" AND SAID YOU CAN'T JUDGE\nTHE PRESIDENCY ON A CURVE AND THAT WHEN YOU RUN FOR PRESIDENT\nYOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.\nHE ALSO NAMED DONALD TRUMP. THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T SEEN\nHIM DO IN EVERY APPEARANCE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ONLY OTHER\nCAMPAIGN APPEARANCE HE'S DONE, THAT ONE HE WAS ALONGSIDE\nHILLARY CLINTON IN CHARLOTTE, THAT WAS MORE POSITIVE AND LESS\nCRITICAL TALKING ABOUT HOW QUALIFIED SHE IS, HOW HE FEELS\nSHE IS THE MOST QUALIFIED CANDIDATE EVER MAN OR WOMAN SAND\nTHE ONLY QUALIFIED CANDIDATE BUT THIS WAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR HIM\nTO HIT DONALD TRUMP, SO MAKING THE CASE THAT HE IS NOT\nQUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT, I THINK THIS IS WHAT WE CAN EXPECT\nTO SEE MORE OF, ESPECIALLY WHEN HE GETS ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL IN\nEARNEST NEXT MONTH. HE KIND OF THROWS IT ALL IN\nTHERE. HE WANTS TO LOOK AT HIS RECORD,\nTALK ABOUT HOW HILLARY CLINTON IS A CONTINUATION OF THE\nPROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN MADE BUT NOW HE'S MADE IT CLEAR HE WILL\nHIT DONALD TRUMP AND HE'LL ATTACK HIM NATIONAL GUARD THESE\nSITUATIONS. BROOKE?\n>> MICHELLE KOSINSKI, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nHE TALKED WORKING CLASS, THE POSITIVE ECONOMY NEWS AND HE\nVENTED A BIT ABOUT THE MEDIA SO LET'S TALK ABOUT ALL OF THE\nABOVE. I HAVE DAVID CHALIAN, POLITICAL\nCOMMENTATOR BILL PRESS ON THE LEFT, TS.E. CUPP, A REPUBLICAN,\nWHO DOESN'T SUPPORT MR. TRUMP AND CNN COMMENTATOR HILARY\nROSEN, A CLINTON SUPPORTER. GREAT TO SEE ALL OF YOU.\nAND BEFORE I GET TO MY PARTISANS, DAVID CHALIAN, WE\nLISTEN TO EVERY WORD OF THE PRESIDENT, WHAT JUMPED OUT AT\nYOU MOST. >> I THINK WHAT YOU PLAYED IS\nWHAT I FOUND THE MOST INTERESTING BIT.\nHE WAS VERY WELL VERSED IN THAT WALK STORY ON THE TRUMP\nFOUNDATION OVER THE WEEKEND. HE WAS VERY WELL VERSED IN THE\nCOMMANDER-IN-CHIEF FORUM WE SAW ON NBC LAST WEEK WHEN HE WAS\nTALKING ABOUT TRUMP NOT BEING PRESSED ON HIS STATED PRE-IRAQ\nWAR OPPOSITION WHICH IS COUNTERFACTUAL FROM WHAT HE TOLD\nHOWARD STERN SO WHAT JUMPED OUT TO ME WAS THE PRESIDENT IS\nKEENLY AWARE OF THE CAMPAIGN DEVELOPMENTS AND IS WATCHING THE\nCAMPAIGN COVERAGE PRETTY CLOSELY OVER THE LAST WEEK, THIS GUY IS\nDIALLED INTO THIS RACE BECAUSE CLEARLY IT IS HIS LEGACY THAT IS\nON THE LINE HERE THAT IS ONE REASON HE FEELS SO INVESTED IN\nHILLARY CLINTON AND THE OTHER AS WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST COUPLE\nMONTHS, HE IS SOMEWHAT ALARMED AT TRUMP'S CANDIDACY AND THOSE\nWERE CLEARLY PRESENT ON THE STUMP TODAY.\n>> HE MENTIONED THE \"T\" WORD BEING TRANSPARENCY.\nKAYLY, I WANT TO COME TO YOU, IF YOU FLICKED ON CNN.COM THE\nHEADLINE WAS LIKE THE LEAST TRANSPARENT ELECTION OF ALL\nTIME. YOU HAD HILLARY CLINTON WITH\nANDERSON SAYING \"I'VE GIVEN MY MEDICAL RECORDS, I'M GIVING MORE\nTHIS WEEK, I'VE GIVEN MY TAX RETURNS FOR A DECADE PLUS.\"\nWHY DON'T WE KNOW MORE ABOUT DONALD TRUMP?\n>> I THINK WE KNOW A LOT ABOUT DONALD TRUMP.\nHE'S BEEN THE MOST ACCESSIBLE CANDIDATE IN POLITICAL HISTORY\nGIVING INTERVIEWS TO FRIENDLY NEWS STATIONS, UNFRIENDLY NEWS\nSTATIONS. HE'S BEEN VERY TRANSPARENT.\n>> AN INTERVIEW IS AN INTERVIEW AND WE'RE GRATEFUL BUT IT'S NOT\nMEDICAL RECORDS OR TAX RETURNS OR PROOF OF AN AUDIT TO GET TAX\nRETURNS. >> YOU'RE NOT REQUIRED BY LAW TO\nRELEASE YOUR TAX RETURNS LIKE WISE YOU'RE NOT REQUIRED TO\nRELEASE YOUR MEDICAL RECORDS, WHAT YOU ARE REQUIRED TO RELEASE\nAND PRESERVE ARE DOCUMENTS WITHIN THE REALM OF THE FEDERAL\nGOVERNMENT, THE FEDERAL RECORDS ACT REQUIRES THAT AND IT'S HARD\nFOR THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION OR FUTURE HOPING TO BE CLINTON\nADMINISTRATION TO MAKE A TRANSPARENCY ARGUMENT WHEN THEY\nTOOK HAMMERS TO BLACKBERRIES, WHEN THEY USED A SOFTWARE\nPROCESS TO BLEACH E-MAILS THAT THEY WERE TO PRESERVE.\n>> VALID CONCERN AND AN ISSUE ON HER TRUSTWORTHINESS BUT I'M\nLOOKING AT YOUR CASE. >> WHEN YOU CAN'T DEFEND YOUR\nATTACK -- AND THIS'S WHAT KAYLEIGH IS DOING.\nHILLARY CLINTON AND BILL CLINTON RELEASED THEIR TAX RETURNS FOR\n2015 WHICH MEANS THEY'VE RELEASED THEIR TAX RETURNS FOR\nTHE LAST 39 YEARS. AND FROM DONALD TRUMP BIG FAT\nZERO. I HAVE A BIG QUESTION -- WHY IS\nDONALD TRUMP SPENDING SO MUCH TIME PRAISING VLADIMIR PUTIN?\nDOES HE HAVE SOME HOTEL DEAL IN MOSCOW?\nWE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE HE WON'T RELEASE HIS TAX RETURN.\nYOU WANT TRANSPARENCY, SEE THE TAX RETURN.\nWHICH MIKE PENCE DID FOR HIS RETURNS.\n>> EXACTLY RIGHT AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT FROM DONALD TRUMP.\n>> THIS IS WHY I AM WHERE I AM SUPPORTING NEITHER CANDIDATE.\nIT'S A RACE TO THE BOTTOM. >> YOU'RE NOT ALONE.\n>> WHEN IT COMES TO TRANSPARENCY AND WHEN IT COMES TO HONESTY AND\nTRUSTWORTHINESS. IT'S APPLES AND ORANGES ON THIS\nISSUE. MAYBE HE WINS ON THIS ONE, MAYBE\nSHE WINS BUT THESE ARE TWO WOULD HAVE THE LEAST-LIKED CANDIDATES\nWE'VE EVER HAD RUN FOR PRESIDENT.\nTHEY'S A REASON WHY. THEY MIGHT NOT BE COMPARABLE, I\nHAPPEN TO THINK THEY'RE NOT BUT THERE'S A REASON WHY ONLY 10% OF\nTHE AMERICAN ELECTORATE NOMINATED THESE TWO PEOPLE TO BE\nTHEIR NOMINEES AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE SITTING AT HOME ARE\nWATCHING SOMEONE LIKE PRESIDENT OBAMA DO A GREAT JOB.\nHE'S VERY CHARMING, VERY GOOD AT CAMPAIGNING BUT MAKING FUN OF\nDONALD TRUMP AND THINKING THIS IS SERIOUS.\nBOTH OF THESE CANDIDATES ARE TERRIBLE.\nWHO AM I GOING TO VOTE FOR? YOU'RE NOT TAKING THIS CANDIDATE\nSERIOUSLY. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE GIVEN\nHILLARY CLINTON A RIDE, A FREE PASS FOR TOO LONG.\nSO THERE ARE A LOT OF FRUSTRATED PEOPLE LIKE ME WITH NOWHERE TO\nGO. >> GO AHEAD HILARY ROSEN ON THE\nFREE PASS. I HEAR YOU MOANING.\n>> I DON'T THINK ANYONE THINKS HILLARY CLINTON HAS GOTTEN A\nFREE PASS, IF ANYTHING I THINK PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO MAKE\nEQUIVALENT TO ARGUMENTS LIKE WE JUST HEARD KAYLEIGH DO ABOUT\nTHEIR PERSONAL ACTIVITIES OVER THE YEARS BUT HERE'S THE\nINTERESTING THING BECAUSE I HEAR MY FRIEND S.E'S FRUSTRATION IN\nHER VOICE WHICH IS ONE OF MY OTHER FAVORITE LINES OF\nPRESIDENT OBAMA THIS YEAR WAS WHEN HE GAVE A SPEECH RECENTLY\nAND SAID \"NOW SOME PEOPLE MIGHT WANT TO PICK SOMETHING OFF THE\nMENU BUT WE GOT FISH OR WE GOT STEAK, YOU HAVE TO PICK ONE, YOU\nHAVE TO ENGAGE.\" THAT'S WHY HIS ARGUMENT TODAY\nABOUT THIS IS -- DEMOCRACY IS NOT A SPECTATOR SPORT, YOU HAVE\nTO GET INTO THE ARENA, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE STAKES THAT\nARE IN PLAY HERE AND FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING TO MATTER THE\nMOST. SO IF YOU'RE FOR NOT RAISING THE\nMINIMUM WAGE, IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THE PROGRESS AND DECISIONS\nTHE SUPREME COURT HAVE MADE, IF YOU WORRY ABOUT HEALTH CARE\nYOU'RE GOING TO BE FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS PROMISED TO BRING PEOPLE BACKWARDS ON THE\nECONOMY, ON PROGRESSIVE ISSUES, ON LEGAL AND EQUAL RIGHTS SO\nIT'S FISH OR STEAK, THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE.\nELECTIONS ARE ABOUT CHOICES. >> ON THE ECONOMY WHEN YOU\nLISTEN TO THESE TWO DIFFERENT CANDIDATES AS WE HAVE FROM\nMONTHS AND MONTHS THEY PAINT TWO VERY DIFFERENT PICTURES OF\nAMERICA BUT DAVID CHALIAN IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT THE FACTS WE\nGOT FROM THE U.S. CENSUS BUREAU, THIS IS SOMETHING THE PRESIDENT\nTOUTED AS HE SAID CHANGE WOULD COME AND IT'S POSITIVE NEWS FOR\nHIM AND THE PRO SERB Y'ALL THIRD TERM IF THERE WERE TO BE A\nPRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON THAT THE MEDIAN INCOME IN THE U.S. IS\nUP. YOU HAVE TO NUMBERS ON THE\nSCREEN. HOW WILL THIS PLAY FOR THE\nDEMOCRATS? >> SO YOU SEE THE TREND THAT IT\nHAD BEEN TRENDING UP, RIGHT? WHAT YOU SEE THERE, THAT LINE.\nNOW IT'S AT A LEVEL WHERE, YOU KNOW, IT WAS HIGHER, IT'S THE\nFASTEST WE'VE SEEN IT CLIMB IS WITH THE STATISTIC.\nMY QUESTION IS ARE PEOPLE FEELING THAT?\nWE'VE TALKED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THESE ECONOMIC STATISTICS\nWE'VE SEEN, MONTH-TO-MONTH UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, WHAT HAVE\nYOU, YET WE KNOW THERE IS A TON OF ECONOMIC STRIFE IN THE\nCOUNTRY AND PEOPLE AREN'T NECESSARILY FEELING IT.\nNOW THAT THE MEDIAN INCOME IS ON THE RISE, ARE PEOPLE FEELING\nTHAT IN A WAY?

JOE, HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN\nMANAGER JUST TOLD CNN THAT SHE WAS TRYING TO \"POWER THROUGH HER\nPNEUMONIA.\" WHAT ELSE ARE YOU HEARING?\n>> Reporter: WELL, THE CAMPAIGN ALSO ADMITTING THAT ESSENTIALLY\nMISTAKES WERE MADE ON THIS, AND PROMISING TO PUT OUT MORE\nMEDICAL RECORDS OF HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHE CANDIDATE HERSELF TWEETING JUST A LITTLE WHILE AGO THAT\nSHE'S DOING WELL, GETTING BETTER, LIKE ANYONE WHO HAS BEEN\nHOME SICK FROM WORK, I'M JUST ANXIOUS TO GET BACK OUT THERE.\nSEE YOU ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. THAT'S WHAT HILLARY CLINTON IS\nTWEETING TONIGHT. TONIGHT, HILLARY CLINTON'S\nCAMPAIGN IS DEALING WITH THE AFTERMATH OF HER WEEKEND HEALTH\nSCARE. CLINTON IS OFF THE TRAIL TODAY\nAFTER MAKING AN EARLY EXIT AT A 9/11 MEMORIAL SERVICE IN NEW\nYORK CITY, WHERE SHE WAS CAUGHT ON CAMERA STUMBLING WHILE BEING\nHELPED INTO A VAN. HER CAMPAIGN NOW SAYS SHE'S BEEN\nDIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA. IT'S A MOMENT THAT'S PUT HER\nCAMPAIGN ON DEFENSE OVER HER HEALTH.\n>> HOW ARE YOU FEELING, SENATOR CLINTON?\n>> FEELING GREAT. >> Reporter: BUT ALSO\nTRANSPARENCY. >> WE SHOULD HAVE PROVIDED MORE\nINFORMATION MORE QUICKLY. >> Reporter: THE PRESS SECRETARY\nBRIAN FALLON SAYS SOME ON THE CAMPAIGN KNEW ABOUT THE ILLNESS\nON FRIDAY. >> SENIOR STAFF WAS AWARE ON\nFRIDAY AND WORD SPREAD AFTER THAT.\n>> Reporter: SUNDAY, AFTER THE VIDEO OF HER LEAVING GROUND ZERO\nSURFACED, THE CAMPAIGN SAID SHE HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH\nPNEUMONIA TWO DAYS EARLIER AND WAS ADVISED TO REST.\nCLINTON IS PREPARING FOR HER DEBATE AGAINST DONALD TRUMP IN\nTWO WEEKS. SHE PLANNED TO GO TO CALIFORNIA\nTODAY FOR BIG TICKET FUND-RAISERS AND A RALLY, BUT\nTHAT TRIP HAS BEEN CANCELED. INSTEAD, SHE WILL CALL IN TO THE\nFUND-RAISER. >> IF SHE HAD DRAUTHERS, SHE\nWOULD BE GOING TO CALIFORNIA TODAY.\n>> Reporter: NEITHER HILLARY CLINTON NOR DONALD TRUMP HAVE\nRELEASED COMPREHENSIVE MEDICAL RECORDS.\n>> WE ARE GOING TO GET ADDITIONAL MATERIAL TOGETHER AND\nRELEASING FURTHER INFORMATION. >> Reporter: IN THE MIDST OF A\nROUGH WEEK -- >> EVERY TIME I THINK ABOUT\nTRUMP, I GET ALLERGIC. >> Reporter: SEVERAL OF\nCLINTON'S TOP AIDES HAVE BEEN SICK WITH UPPER RESPIRATORY\nISSUES, TOO. TRUMP HAS BEEN CRITICAL OF\nCLINTON'S HEALTH ON THE TRAIL. >> SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STRENGTH\nOR THE STAMINA TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, BELIEVE ME.\n>> Reporter: BUT IN AN INTERVIEW TODAY, HE WISHED HER WELL.\n>> SOMETHING'S GOING ON. I JUST HOPE SHE GETS WELL AND\nBACK ON THE TRAIL AND WE'LL BE SEEING HER AT THE DEBATE.\n>> Reporter: AND VOWED TO RELEASE HIS MEDICAL RECORDS\nLATER IN THE WEEK. >> THIS LAST WEEK I TOOK A\nPHYSICAL. I'LL BE RELEASING WHEN THE\nNUMBERS COME IN, HOPEFULLY THEY'RE GOING TO BE GOOD.\nI FEEL GREAT. BUT WHEN THE NUMBERS COME IN, I\nWILL BE RELEASING VERY SPECIFIC NUMBERS.\n>> Reporter: AND A LITTLE MORE NEWS TONIGHT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS\nDURING HILLARY CLINTON'S RECUPERATION PERIOD.\nHER HUSBAND, THE FORMER PRESIDENT, EXPECTED TO FILL IN\nFOR HER AT AN EVENT IN CALIFORNIA ON TUESDAY, AND\nANOTHER EVENT ON WEDNESDAY IN NEVADA.\nNO WORD ON WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT.\nWOLF? >> JOE, THANK YOU.\nJOE JOHNS REPORTING. LET'S GET SOME MORE ON ALL OF\nTHIS. THE MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY BILL\nDe BLASIO IS JOINING US, A STRONG SUPPORTER OF HECK.\nTHANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US.\n>> YOU'RE WELCOME, WOLF. >> YOU WERE AT THE 9/11 MEMORIAL\nSERVICES YESTERDAY. DID YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO SPEAK\nWITH HILLARY CLINTON THERE BEFORE SHE LEFT?\nAND IF YOU DID, HOW DID SHE SEEM TO YOU AT THAT EVENT?\n>> WOLF, SHE SEEMED GOOD. I SPOKE TO HER FOR A WHILE.\nIT WAS A VERY CROWDED SPACE, VERY HOT, AND PEOPLE WERE COMING\nUP TO HER, CONVERSATION AFTER CONVERSATION.\nSHE SEEMED GOOD. I'VE KNOWN HILLARY FOR 16 YEARS,\nSHE HAS EXTRAORDINARY STAMINA. EXTRAORDINARY WORK ETHIC.\nIT DOES NOT SURPRISE ME ONE BIT THAT EVEN THOUGH SHE WASN'T\nFEELING WELL, AND SHE COULD HAVE SAID HEY, I NEED A FEW DAYS\nDOWN, IT'S NOT LIKE HER. SHE TRIES TO WORK THROUGH\nEVERYTHING. SHE WAS GREETING EVERYONE,\nPERFECTLY ENERGETIC. BUT LOOK, THE BOTTOM LINE HERE\nIS, WE KNOW A LOT ABOUT HILLARY CLINT\nCLINTON'S HEALTH. SHE'S HAD SOME CHALLENGES,\nADDRESSED THEM. AS SECRETARY OF STATE, SHE DID\nAN AMAZING JOB ON CRISIS AFTER CRISIS.\nWE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S HEALTH EXCEPT A\nLETTER WHERE HIS PHYSICIAN SAID HE WOULD BE THE HEALTHIEST\nPRESIDENT WE'VE EVER HAD. WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT TRUMP.\nWE'VE NEVER SEEN HIM HAVE TO PERFORM YEARS AND YEARS OF\nCONSISTENT WORK LIKE HILLARY CLINTON.\nSO WHAT IS THE REALITY OF DONALD TRUMP?\nWE KNOW THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS THE STAMINA AND THE ENERGY.\n>> HE SAID HE HAD A PHYSICAL LAST WEEK AND THE NUMBERS WOULD\nBE RELEASED LATER THIS WEEK. WE ALSO HEARD FROM HILLARY\nCLINTON'S CAMPAIGN THAT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT HER HEALTH\nWILL BE RELEASED LATE THEY ARE WEEK.\nYOU WANTED TO MAKE ANOTHER COMMENT?\n>> WE'LL SEE IF HE DOES IT. HE HASN'T RELEASED HIS TAXES.\n>> WE'LL SEE IF HE DOES RELEASE THE RESULTS OF THE PHYSICAL,\nWHAT ELSE RERELEASES AND WHAT STANDARD BOTH OF THESE\nCANDIDATES WILL RELEASE INFORMATION.\nSHOULDN'T HILLARY CLINTON HAVE BEEN TRANSPARENTED AND RELEASED\nTHE FACT THAT SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA RIGHT AWAY?\n>> I DON'T THINK HAVING A DIAGNOSIS LIKE THAT REQUIRES\nPUBLIC DISCLOSURE. SHE HAD EVERY RIGHT TO SPEND A\nFEW DAYS RECUPERATING, JUST LIKE ANYONE ELSE.\nSHE HAD ALLERGY ISSUES, SHE WAS TAKING ANTIHISTAMINES FOR THAT.\nI DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO ALERT THE PUBLIC EVERY TIME THAT\nYOU'RE SICK, YOU GO TO THE DOCTOR AND THEY SAY HERE'S A\nMEDICATION YOU HAVE TO TAKE. THAT'S MORE OF A PERCEPTION\nQUESTION THAN A VALUES QUESTION. THE BOTTOM LINE HERE, IS SHE\nSOMEONE READY FOR THE RIGGORS O THE PRESIDENCY?\nTHERE'S NO QUESTION SHE'S READY FOR IT.\nAND THE WAY SHE'S BEEN COMPORTING HERSELF ON THIS\nCAMPAIGN NOW, A YEAR AND A HALF CRISSCROSSING THE COUNTRY.\nDONALD TRUMP IS TRYING TO CREATE A HEALTH SCARE AROUND HILLARY\nCLINTON. THE IRONY IS, WE DON'T KNOW HOW\nHEALTHY DONALD TRUMP IS. SO SOME OF THIS IS THE POSTURING\nOF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN THAT'S CAUGHT A LITTLE FIRE NOW.\nBUT I DON'T THINK THE ESSENTIAL TRUTH IS ACTUALLY A CONCERN.\nWE KNOW A LOT ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON.\nWE KNOW SHE'S HEALTHY. >> BUT WE WERE ALL ALARMED WHEN\nWE SAW THAT VIDEO. I'M SURE YOU WERE AALARMED, AS\nWELL. SHE LEFT THE 9/11 EVENT EARLY,\nSHE WAS BEING ESCORTED. AS SHE WALKS INTO THAT VAN, SHE\nCOLLAPSES. THERE YOU'LL SEE IT RIGHT THERE.\nSHE GOES DOWN. THEY CARRY HER INTO THE VAN.\nWE SAW THAT VIDEO. I'M SURE YOU AGREE, IT WAS VERY,\nVERY DISTURBING. >> WELL, WOLF, YOU KNOW, WE'VE\nSEEN OVER THE YEARS LEADERS WHO WERE DEHYDRATED AND I REMEMBER\nONCE WHEN GEORGE H.W. BUSH WAS ON THAT PRESIDENTIAL TRIP TO\nJAPAN AND HAD AN EPISODE AT A STATE DINNER IN JAPAN.\nIT'S NOT UNHEARD OF FOR PEOPLE WHO WORK THIS HARD TO HAVE THESE\nMOMENTS. BUT AS YOU SAW AN HOUR OR TWO\nLATER, SHE WAS OUT WAVING TO THE CAMERAS AND HER OLD SELF.\nTEN MINUTES EARLIER, I WAS RIGHT NEXT TO HER AT THE TIME SHE LEFT\nTHE EVENT AND SHE WAS CHATTING WITH EVERYONE.\nI JUST THINK THE HEAT GOT TO HER AND SHE WAS DEALING WITH THIS\nCONDITION FOR A FEW DAYS. BUT WE SHOULDN'T MAKE MORE OF\nIT. WE HAVE TO GET TO THE CORE ISSUE\nHERE. IS SHE SOMEONE WELL QUALIFIED TO\nBE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES?\nIN EVERY SENSE, PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST QUALIFIED EVER,\nINCLUDING EXHIBITED THE STAMINA YOU NEED FOR THAT JOB.\nSHE'S A KNOWN QUANTITY. MY QUESTION IS, SINCE DONALD\nTRUMP HAS NEVER BEEN IN PUBLIC SERVICE, HE'S LIVERED A VERY\nPAMPERED LIFESTYLE, CAN HE KEEP ONE THE RIGORS OF THE\nPRESIDENCY? WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF EVIDENCE\nABOUT THAT. >> BACK IN 2008, JOHN McCAIN\nALLOWED REPORTERS TO REVIEW EIGHT YEARS' WORTH OF HIS\nMEDICAL RECORDS. HE WAS 70-YEAR-OLD OLD AT THE\nTIME. REPORTERS WERE ALSO ALLOWED TO\nINTERVIEW HIS DOCTORS. SHOULD HILLARY CLINTON, WHO IS\nALMOST 69, AND DONALD TRUMP WHO IS 70, DO THE SAME THING RIGHT\nNOW TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC, THE VOTERS OUT\nTHERE WHO HAVE TO ELECT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES\nTHAT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE? >> LOOK, I THINK DISCLOSURE IS\nALWAYS HELPFUL. I THINK THERE'S STILL SOME\nISSUES OF PRIVACY THAT PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO, EVEN WHEN THEY\nRUN FOR OFFICE. IT'S DIFFERENT THAN TAXES.\nOBVIOUSLY, HILLARY CLINTON HAS RELEASED HER TAX RETURNS GOING\nMANY YEARS BACK. DONALD TRUMP HAS NOT.\nON HEALTH RECORDS, HILLARY CLINTON'S ALREADY PROVIDED THE\nLEVEL OF HEALTH RECORDS THAT WE HAVE SEEN FROM REPUBLICAN AND\nDEMOCRATIC NOMINEES FOR PRESIDENTS IN RECENT YEARS.\nAND SHE SAID THAT MORE IS COMING AND I BELIEVE HER.\nSHE HAS A HISTORY OF PROVIDING THESE RECORDS.\nI THINK WE'LL HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION WE NEED.\nTHE QUESTION IS, AGAIN, I DON'T TAKE IT ON FACE VALUE DONALD\nTRUMP WILL RELEASE ANYTHING. IT'S AN OPEN QUESTION.\nAND HE HAS NO EXPERIENCE WITH HAVING TO BE TRANSPARENT,\nBECAUSE HE'S BEEN SOMEONE WHO, IN ALL OF HIS BUSINESS DEALINGS,\nBENEFITED FROM KEEPING THINGS SECRET AND LIVED THE LIFE AGAIN\nOF A BILLIONAIRE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR.\nI THINK WE KNOW A LOT ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHE BIG QUESTION FOR ME, WHAT IS THE TRUTH ABOUT DONALD TRUMP?\n>> WE'LL SEE WHAT HE RELEASES LATER THIS WEEK.\nAS FAR AS SHE'S CONCERNED, DOES IT HURT HER WITH VOTERS WHO -- A\nLOT OF WHOM ARE HAVING TROUBLE TRUSTING HER, FOR EXAMPLE, IF\nSHE ISN'T MORE FORTHCOMING, SHE'S FORTHCOMING ON HER TAX\nRETURNS. SHE'S RELEASED 20 YEARS WORTH OF\nHER TAX RETURNS. BUT WITH HER HEALTH, SHOULD SHE\nBE MORE FORTH COMING? >> THERE'S A LEVEL OF\nTRANSPARENCY THAT HELPS BUT STILL A RIGHT OF PRIVACY THAT\nEVERY PERSON HAS. IT WAS VERY GOOD WHEN THIS CAME\nUP TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SHE WAS SUFFERING FROM PNEUMONIA AND\nMEDICATION SHE WAS TAKING. OBVIOUSLY, WE EXPECT A QUICK\nRECOVERY. THE BOTTOM LINE ON ALL OF THESE\nTHINGS IS HOW DO WE GET TO KNOW A CANDIDATE AND WHAT THEY'RE\nGOING TO DO FOR US? ONE OF THE THINGS WE SEEN ABOUT\nHILLARY CLINTON IS SHE'S GOT A CHALLENGE.\nIF THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH HILLARY CLINTON, IT IS SHE WORKS\nTOO HARD. SHE DOESN'T TAKE THE TIME\nALWAYS. I CAN SAY THIS FROM PERSONAL\nEXPERIENCE, SHE DOESN'T ALWAYS TAKE THE TIME SHE SHOULD FOR\nHERSELF. IT'S NOT SURPRISING SHE TRIED TO\nPOWER THROUGH THIS. AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES, MY ADVICE WOULD BE, YOU DESERVE A LITTLE DOWNTIME.\nBUT I WOULD RATHER HAVE SOMEONE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT WHOSE\nPROBLEM IS THEY WORK TOO HARD AND WHO TRIES TO POWER THROUGH A\nDISEASE AND KEEP DOING WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING.\nI THINK THAT'S A VERY PRESIDENTIAL ATTRIBUTE.\nAND I HAVE A LOT OF FAITH SHE'S READY TO RUN THIS COUNTRY.\n>> MAYOR, WE HAVE MORE TO DISCUSS, INCLUDING HILLARY\nCLINTON'S USE OF THE PHRASE \"BASKET OF DEPLORABLES.\"\nSTICK AROUND. WE'LL CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION\nRIGHT AFTER THIS QUICK BREAK.",

HE HASN'T RELEASED ONE.\nSANDRA: MEANTIME SYNDICATED COLUMNIST CHARLES KRAUTHAMER\nSAYS HILLARY'S CAMPAIGN SAID HILLARY'S CAMPAIGN SHOULD HAVE\nBEEN HONEST FROM THE GET-GO. THAT THIS EPISODES POINTS TO A\nLARGER QUESTION OF TRUST. >> I THINK THIS IS ANOTHER CASE\nOF THE COVER-UP BEING WORSE THAN THE CRIME.\nIF IT IS WHAT THEY SAY IT IS, THIS IS TOTALLY BENIGN, THEY\nSHOULD HAVE EXPLAINED IT RIGHT AWAY, AND THIS AS EVERYBODY CAN\nSEE, IT JUST ADDS TO THE IMPRESSION THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE\nSIMPLY INCAPABLE OF TELLING THE TRUTH, THE SIMPLE TRUTH.\nSANDRA: SO LET'S GO BACK, BILL, TO HILLARY CLINTON SAYING I JUST\nDIDN'T THINK IT WAS GOING TO BE THIS BIG OF A DEAL.\n>> I THINK SHE WANTED TO POWER THROUGH.\nI THINK SHE HAS BEEN PROBABLY DOING THAT FOR A LONG TIME.\nWE WITHIN OUR OWN JOBS WANT TO FIND STRENGTH TO GET THROUGH THE\nDALE. THIS IS REALLY GRUELING STUFF.\nMEGHAN, I WAS WITH YOUR FATHER EIGHT YEARS AGO IN\nNEW HAMPSHIRE, JUST TO SEE WHAT YOU DO, YOU REALLY GOT TO WANT\nIT. >> PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA.\nA SCHEDULE UNLIKE AN OLYMPIAN. GET UP IN THE MORNING, DON'T GET\nHOME UNTIL MIDNIGHT AND MEETING PEOPLE AT EVENTS ALL DAY.\n>> JOHN KERRY IN IOWA, 2004, HE HAD A GAP HE NEEDED TO CLOSE,\nRENTED A HELICOPTER AND FLEW ALL OVER THE STATE.\nHE HIMMED IN THERE SUNDAY NIGHT AND HIS VOICE WAS HOARSE AND HE\nWON. THAT IS SOMETHING YOU NEED TO\nDO. WITH REGARD TO HILLARY, SHE\nCOMES BACK AT THE END. WEEK, SHOWS STRENGTH, THIS WILL\nBEHIND HER. IF SHE COMES BACK AND THERE IS\nANOTHER EPISODE, IT COULD BE BIG.\nSANDRA: HOW DIFFERENT, LIZ, WOULD TODAY BE, IF CHARLES\nKRAUTHAMER SUGGESTED THEY SHOULD HAVE TOLD THE TRUTH FROM THE\nBEGINNING, IF IT WAS INDEED PNEUMONIA, THAT HER DOCTOR\nDIAGNOSED HER ON FRIDAY, HOW DIFFERENT WOULD TODAY BE IF THEY\nTOLD EVERYBODY THAT ON FRIDAY? >> REMEMBER.\nSHE WASN'T GOING TO A LOT OF CAMPAIGN EVENTS RECENTLY.\nTHEREFORE LETTING THIS NARRATIVE TAKE HOLD ABOUT THE EMAIL AND,\nSERVER IN THE BASEMENT OF THE HOME WITHOUT ANSWERING THE\nQUESTIONS ABOUT THAT. DID SHE LOSE SOME GROUND GAME TO\nTRUMP? POSSIBLY.\nSO INSTEAD OF TRANSPARENT, SAY I'M SICK, THEN VOTER, MEDIA SAY,\nSHE IS SICK, GIVE HER SOME LEEWAY ON IT.\nBUT ISSUE, WHAT IF THE SMARTPHONES WEREN'T THERE?\nWHAT IF NOBODY EVEN SAW THAT VIDEO AND KNEW ABOUT IT?\nWOULD WE KNOW SHE HAD PNEUMONIA NOW IF IT WASN'T THERE IF.\nSANDRA: THAT LEAVES ONLY ROOM FOR MORE SPECULATION AS\n\"NEW YORK POST\" COVER TODAY, THROW IT UP THERE, IT SAYS\nILLARY THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU LEAVE THAT MUCH ROOM FOR\nSPECULATION, RIGHT, HARRIS? >> WHAT IS INTERESTING OTHERS\nCOMING ON BOARD SAYING HOW SICK THEY HAVE BEEN.\nCHUCK SCHUMER RECENTLY HAD PNEUMONIA.\nNOT SAYING THAT HE FEELS FOR HER, NOT JUST HAVING EMPATHY, I\nWAS KIND OF IN THE SAME BOAT. THIS IS HOW YOU GET THROUGH IT\nAND HOW LONG IT TAKES. IT CAUSES PEOPLE TO COME TO HER\nSIDE. SO THEN I START TO QUESTION,\nWELL, IF YOU HAD TO CHANGE THE NARRATIVE FROM THE EMAILS AND\nYOU MIGHT BE SEEN AS A SYMPATHETIC FIGURE, WHY NOT EVEN\nTELL THEM YOU HAD PNEUMONIA ON FRIDAY?\nI GUESS SHE COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN THIS.\nSANDRA: THERE IS THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE MEDICAL\nRECORDS AND HOW MUCH HAS BEEN RELEASED, HOW MUCH MORE SHOULD\nBE RELEASED. HOW THOROUGH WE SHOULD LOOK AT\nTHEIR MEDICAL HISTORY. MEGHAN, HOW IMPORTANT, GOING\nBACK TO YOUR POINT ABOUT THE GRUELING SCHEDULE, YOU'RE\nTALKING ABOUT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.\nWHAT ABOUT ACTUALLY BEING PRESIDENT?\nHOW IMPORTANT IS IT FOR VOTERS TO SEE THE HEALTH OF THE\nCANDIDATE? >> I THINK HEALTH IS INCREDIBLY\nIMPORTANT IF YOU'RE NOT PHYSICALLY CAPABLE OF BEING\nPRESIDENT THIS IS SOMETHING THE AMERICAN VOTER SHOULD KNOW.\nTHIS BLOWS MY MIND TRUMP AND HILLARY HAVEN'T RELEASED MEDICAL\nRECORDS. THIS IS SOMETHING THE AMERICAN\nPUBLIC NEED TO KNOW. PIVOTING, OFF THIS, BILL, I\nTHINK IS MUCH BIGGER DEAL. COUGHING FIT.\nONE TIME LOOKING A LITTLE SICK IN THE DEBATES.\nSOMETIMES SHE LOOKS FATIGUED THREE HOURS THROUGH, THE\nAMERICAN PUBLIC WILL BE SHE IS NOT PHYSICALLY UP TO THIS.\nHARRIS: WE TALK ABOUT THE 55 DAYS UNTIL THE ELECTION.\nTHE NEXT BIG POINT, UNDER HOT LIGHTS FOR THE STAGE 90 MINUTES.\nINCREDIBLE PRESSURE. YOU'RE WITH DONALD TRUMP.\nDON'T KNOW WHICH DIRECTION. HE IS NOT TRADITIONAL TYPE OF\nCANDIDATE YOU WOULD HAVE DEBATED.\nSHE HASN'T EXPERIENCED WHAT THE 15, 16 OTHER GUYS EXPERIENCED.\nMEGHAN: ANOTHER QUESTION ABOUT THE CAPABILITY TO LEAD IS PEOPLE\nSURROUNDING HERSELF BY. IF THIS WERE MY FATHER ON THE\nCAMPAIGN AND HIS STAFF DIDN'T IMMEDIATELY TAKE HIM TO THE\nHOSPITAL. HARRIS: SOMEONE IS MISSING.\nHUMA ABEDIN. MEGHAN: DOESN'T MATTER.\nIF ONLY ONE WOMAN CAN HANDLE HILLARY CLINTON AND APPARENTLY A\nTEAM OF PEOPLE WON'T GIVE HER WATER OR SHE WON'T DRINK WATER\nAND NOT PHYSICALLY TAKING CARE OF YOURSELF AND DON'T HAVE A\nTEAM CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR HEALTH FIRST AND FOREMOST.\nI DON'T HAVE FAITH IN THE TEAM. >> SHE IS RUNNING THE SHOW.\nSANDRA: BEFORE WE LEAVE THIS, DONALD TRUMP'S STRATEGY SO FAR\nIS I HOPE SHE IS BETTER SOON. I HOPE SHE GETS WELL.\nGOOD STRATEGY. >> I INDEED DO.\nREMARKABLE THING, LEADING DEMOCRATS COME OUT QUESTION\nWHETHER HILLARY CLINTON SHOULD BE ON THE TICKET.\nTHIS IS PHENOMENAL THING. DON FOWLER RAN THE DNC IN THE\n1990S, FOR THREE YEARS. WOULD YOU BE STUPID, OR FOOLISH\nNOT TO HAVE SOMEBODY AS BACKUP. WHAT MARINE DOWD SAID, IT IS NOT\nHEALTH BUT THE STEALTH. REPUBLICANS TALKING THIS FOR\nYEARS ABOUT THE CLINTONS. DEMOCRATS DOING IT AS WELL.\nHARRIS: YOU TOUCHED ON THIS AS WELL.\nWHILE HILLARY CLINTON RECOVERS, BILL CLINTON IS GOING TO\nFUND-RAISERS. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A BIG WEEK\nFOR THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE. SHE WOULD KICK THE CAMPAIGN OFF\nAFTER A QUIET AUGUST, RELATIVELY QUIET FOR HER THERE.\nARE GROWING QUESTIONS WHETHER DONALD TRUMP COULD BENEFIT HER\nBEING OFF THE TRAIL. STAYED AWAY FROM PULLING INTO\nPOLITICS. HE WISHED HER WELL, MOSTLY\nSTAYED ON MESSAGE, GIVING CAREFULLY-WORDED SPEECHES,\nISSUING POLICY PAPERS ABOUT TOP ISSUES AND LEAVING OFF INSULTS.\nBILL, YOU SAID YOU THINK THIS IS SMART FOR HIM TO DO.\nTHIS FEED AS NEGATIVE NARRATIVE ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON.\nLOW ENERGY. IS SHE FIT PHYSICALLY TO HOLD\nOFFICE? SO LONG SO FORTH.\nHOW LONG DO YOU STAY AWAY FROM THE NARRATIVE WHICH HE HELPED\nCREATE BY THE WAY? >> FEW MONTHS AGO, TRUMP WAS\nTALKING ABOUT STAMINA AND STRENGTH THEN.\nTHIS IS PLAYING RIGHT INTO HIS STRATEGY.\nI HAVE FOR A LONG TIME CIRCLED OCTOBER 1st ON THE CALENDAR\nBECAUSE THAT WILL BE FIVE FULL DAYS AFTER THE FIRST DEBATE,\nSEPTEMBER 26th, 13 DAYS AWAY.\nHARRIS: GO ON. SANDRA: WE GOT IT.\n>> SO YOU'VE GOT THESE MAJOR POLLING CENTERS THAT WILL HAVE\nTUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, AND FRIDAY OF THAT WEEK AFTER\nDEBATE NUMBER ONE. YOU WILL KNOW ON SATURDAY\nWHETHER OR NOT TRUMP HAS LEGITIMATE SHOT.\nTHAT IS MY THINK. HARRIS: WE HAVEN'T TALK ABOUT,\nELIZABETH, EARLY VOTING THAT COMES INTO PLAY.\n>> YES. HARRIS: BEFORE THE CALENDAR\nBEFORE DEBATES ARE UP. >> NORTH CAROLINA STARTED LAST\nFRIDAY. HARRIS: WE DON'T KNOW WHAT\nTHEY'RE DOING, THEY WILL BE AFFECTED BY SOME OF THINGS AS\nPEOPLE TO TO THE POLLS ALREADY. LIZ: YOU'RE RIGHT, 55 DAYS FROM\nNOW, THIS TO BE HAPPENING IN THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS PRETTY\nSTUNNING. SEEMS LIKE EVERY DAY SOMETHING\nCOMES UP. YOU KNOW, THE ONE THING THAT\nTRUMP CAN MAKE HAY WITH, THIS POINT IS BEING MADE, THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN IS SAYING, YOU KNOW, WE'RE TAKING CARE OF IT.\nJUST SCOOT DOESN'T BENCH. JUST SET THIS ASIDE.\nMOVE ALONG, POWER FORWARD BUT HILLARY CLINTON CITED HER\nCONCUSSION WHEN SHE WAS SPEAKING WITH THE FBI AS SAYING, LISTEN,\nI HAD A CONCUSSION. I DON'T RECALL THE BRIEFINGS ON\nCLASSIFIED INFO. >> 2012.\nYOU'RE POINT ABOUT EARLY VOTING BEFORE IT GETS TOO FAR AWAY FROM\nUS, MITT ROMNEY BEAT BARACK OBAMA ON ELECTION DAY\nFOUR YEARS AGO, BUT OBAMA BEAT ROMNEY IN THE EARLY VOTE PRIOR\nTO THAT, WHICH IS, A LOT OF THE REASON WHY DEMOCRATS TRY TO GET\nEARLY VOTE OUT THERE. THEY HAVE A HARDER TIME GETTING\nTHEIR PEOPLE TO THE POLLS ON ELECTION DAY.\nSANDRA: STARTING IN OCTOBER, YOU KNOW THE PRESIDENT CLEARED HIS\nSCHEDULE TO GO OUT THERE AND CAMPAIGN FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nSO SHE HAS GOT THAT LINED UP. IF YOU HAVE BILL CLINTON SUBBING\nIN FOR HER RECOVERING IN CHAPPAQUA, YOU HAVE TO DECIDE\nWHETHER HE HELPED OR HURT HER ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\nHARRIS: WE DIDN'T SEE HIM ON SUNDAY REPORTEDLY WHEN THIS WAS\nGOING ON. MEGHAN: INTERVIEW FROM CHARLIE\nROSE, THIS HAPPENS OFTEN OR MANY TIMES REFERRING TO THE FAINTING.\nHORRIBLE SURROGATES OF THIS CAMPAIGN IS BECAUSE OF HIM.\nDOESN'T LOOK LIKE HE IS IN TERRIBLY AMAZING HEALTH.\nHARRIS: MEGHAN, YOU DON'T THINK HIS COMMENTS RECALLS, I WANT TO\nPOINT OUT WHERE WAS BILL CLINTON ON SUNDAY WHEN THIS IS UNFOLDING\nYOU DON'T THINK -- MEGHAN: HE IS LOOSE CANNON.\nIF I WERE ON THE CAMPAIGN I WOULDN'T PUT HIM ON TV.\nLOOK WHAT HE SAID. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT.\nSHE SAID THIS HAPPENED TWICE BEFORE.\nHE SAID IT HAPPENED A FEW TIMES, MULTIPLE TIMES.\nIS SHE FAINTING EVERYWHERE? THERE IS NO TRANSPARENCY WITH\nANY OF THIS.

AND ON THAT NOTE I AM JOINED BY\nOUR POLITICAL PANEL. DAVID CHALIAN AND REBECCA BURKE.\nI'M NOT GOING TO ASK YOU TO WEIGH IN ON GOVERNOR PERRY'S\nWHATEVER YOU CALL THAT. DAVID, LET ME ASK YOU, PRESIDENT\nOBAMA, IN PHILLY TODAY, IN PENNSYLVANIA.\nPENNSYLVANIA, A STATE THAT HAS NOT VOTED FOR A REPUBLICAN FOR\nPRESIDENT SINCE 1988. DOES THE FACT THAT HE WENT TO\nPENNSYLVANIA SUGGEST THAT THAT STATE IS IN PLAY?\n>> WELL, IT DEFINITELY SUGGESTS THAT.\nTHERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. ALSO, WHERE HE WENT SPECIFICALLY\nIN PHILADELPHIA IS WITH A TASK AT HAND BECAUSE THERE ARE\nCERTAIN PARTS OF THE OBAMA COALITION THAT RIGHT NOW HILLARY\nCLINTON IS UNDERPERFORMING WITH IN A LOT OF BATTLE GROUND STATE\nPOLLS. SPECIFICALLY WITH LATINOS AND\nYOUNG PEOPLE. SO GOING TO A MINORITY HEAVY\nCOMMUNITY LIKE PHILADELPHIA WHERE IT ALSO HAS A LOT OF YOUNG\nPEOPLE, HE IS THERE TO ACTUALLY TURN OUT THE COALITION.\nBUT MORE BROADLY TO PENNSYLVANIA AND YOUR POINT, I THINK\nPENNSYLVANIA MAY END UP BEING ONE OF THE KEYS TO THIS\nELECTION. DONALD TRUMP'S PATH, AS WE'VE\nTALKED ABOUT, IT IS NARROW. IT'S A TOUGH CLIMB TO GET --\n>> HE HAS TO RUN THE TABLE REALLY.\n>> HE DOES. PENNSYLVANIA IS A TRIGGER FOR\nHIM. IF HE CAN'T MAKE AN INROAD THERE\nAND ACTUALLY CONVERT THAT STATE, HIS ABILITY TO GET TO 270\nBECOMES MUCH MORE COMPLICATED. HE HAS TO PUT LIKE SEVEN OTHER\nREALLY COMPETITIVE STATES ON HIS SIDE.\nPENNSYLVANIA, IF HE CAN WOO IT TO HIS SIDE, OPENS UP A PATH TO\n270. >> I AGREE IT'S KEY.\nHE IS GOING THERE THIS EVENING TO PRESENT HIS PLAN FOR PAID\nMATERNITY LEAVE. REBECCA, I WONDER, OTHER\nREPUBLICANS IN THE PAST, EVERYONE ALWAYS TALKS ABOUT\nGOING AFTER PENNSYLVANIA THE SAME WAY DEMOCRATS ALWAYS TALK\nABOUT MISSOURI. AND AT THE END OF THE DAY,\nTHREE, FOUR WEEKS OUT I THINK HE MEANS IT.\nMR. TRUMP I THINK WILL BE CAMPAIGNING THERE UNTIL THE VERY\nEND. >> THE REASON HE IS DOING FAIRLY\nWELL IN PENNSYLVANIA AND MAYBE BETTER THAN WE WOULD EXPECT IS\nBECAUSE, AS YOU KNOW, THE WHITE WORKING CLASS -- THERE IS A\nHIGHER PROPORTION THAN IN OTHER STATES.\nTHAT'S WHY TRUMP IS DOING WELL IN IOWA WHICH OBAMA WON BY FIVE\nPOINTS IN 2012. BECAUSE HE WAS ABLE TO WIN OVER\nTHE WHITE WORKING CLASS IN A WAY HILLARY CLINTON IS NOT.\nDONALD TRUMP IS COMPLETELY CONSOLIDATING THIS DEMOGRAPHIC.\nIN STATES WITH A HIGHER PROPORTION OF WHITE WORKING\nCLASS, A LOWER PROPORTION OF COLLEGE-EDUCATED VOTERS, HE HAS\nA REALLY GOOD CHANCE. WITH THE NEW MESSAGE HE IS\nLOOKING TO BRING NEW VOTERS IN HIS FOLD.\nSUBURBAN WHITE WOMEN. WITH THE PAID MATERNITY PUSH.\nIT'S NOT A CONVENTIONAL REPUBLICAN POSITION.\nIT'S ONE SOME OF TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS IN THE PAST LIKE\nLAURA INGRAM AND SEAN HANNITY HAVE MOCKED.\n>> IT'S A DEMOCRAT POSITION, BASICALLY TO HAVE SIX WEEKS PAID\nMATERNITY LEAVE FOR MOMS. DAVID, LET ME ASK YOU, THE\nATTEMPT TO GO AROUND THE COLLAR OF PHILADELPHIA AND WINNING OVER\nTHE MOMS. WHEN MIKE PENCE REFUSES TO USE\nTHE WORD \"DEPLORABLE\" TO TALK ABOUT DAVID DUKE AND IT COMES IN\nTHE CONTEXT OF A LOT OF RATHER DEPLORABLE PEOPLE BEING VERY\nVOCAL TRUMP SUPPORTERS, NOT A MAJORITY, NOT HALF, BUT A LOT OF\nTHEM. AND I JUST WONDERED, DOES THAT\nHURT THAT ATTEMPT TO GO INTO THE COLLAR, TO GO INTO MONTGOMERY\nCOUNTY AND THE OTHER SUBURBS OUTSIDE PHILLY AND TO OTHER\nWOMEN? >> IT'S WHY WE SEE -- YOU KNOW,\nWHEN DONALD TRUMP WAS OUT COURTING THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN\nVOTE, GOING -- YOU REMEMBER HE WENT TO MICHIGAN, HE WENT TO\nOTHER PLACES. EVEN THOUGH HE WAS TALKING TO\nLARGELY WHITE CROWDS INITIALLY BEFORE THE DETROIT TRIP, HE WAS\nTALKING ABOUT HIS WOOING OF THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE AND HOW\nWELL HE THOUGHT -- WE TALKED THEN, IT WASN'T ABOUT JUST\nTRYING TO DIG INTO HILLARY CLINTON'S ENORMOUS ADVANTAGE\nWITH AFRICAN-AMERICANS. PART OF THAT WAS TO APPEAL TO\nWHITE SUBURBANITES AS A MORE TOLERANT PERSON THAN THEY THINK\nHE IS. THAT HE IS WILLING TO DO THE\nOUTREACH. THAT WAS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF\nWHAT HE WAS DOING. WHEN MIKE PENCE DOESN'T WANT TO\nUSE THE WORD \"DEPLORABLE\" AND WON'T USE THAT AND SAY DAVID\nDUKE IS DEPLORABLE AND THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN MAKES HAY OF\nTHAT, THE FIRST PLACE THAT WILL BE FELT IS IN THESE SUBURBAN\nAREAS. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN PEOPLE WHO\nMAY BE ON THE FENCE, IF THEY THINK THE TRUMP/PENCE CAMPAIGN\nIS TOLERANT OF THIS HATRED, IT BECOMES A HUGE TURNOFF.\n>> YOU DON'T WANT TO USE THE SAME WORD AS HILLARY CLINTON.\nWHY NOT JUST SAY IT'S DISGUSTING, RACIST, I HATE IT, I\nDON'T WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO IT.\nWE'VE SEEN THIS DONALD TRUMP RETWEETING WHITE SUPREMACISTS,\nPEOPLE WITH THE NAME \"WHITE GENOCIDE\" IN THEIR HANDLE.\nEXPLAIN TO ME WHAT YOU THINK IS GOING ON.\n>> IT'S A LITTLE CONFUSING BECAUSE MIKE PENCE WILL GO OUT\nTHERE AND SAY WE DON'T WANT HIS SUPPORT, WE DON'T WANT THE\nSUPPORT OF PEOPLE WHO THINK THE WAY THAT DAVID DUKE THINKS.\nBUT THEN GOING ONE STEP FURTHER TO SAY DEPLORABLE IS A LINE HE\nWON'T CROSS. PART OF THIS CALCULATION, I\nTHINK, IS THAT THEY RECOGNIZE THEIR CORE SUPPORTERS ARE\nCOMPRISED, IN PART, BY THESE ALT-RIGHT PEOPLE, BUT PEOPLE WHO\nHAVE THESE WHITE NATIONALIST VIEWS.\nAND THEY DON'T WANT TO TURN OFF ANY CORE SUPPORTERS IN THE LAST\n55 DAYS OF THIS ELECTION. BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO JUST AN\nADMISSION BY THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN THAT THIS IS NOT TURF THAT'S\nFAVORABLE TO THEM. THEY WANT TO MOVE THE\nCONVERSATION IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION.\nTHAT'S WHY I AM REALLY INTERESTED BY THIS TACTIC,\nFOCUSING ON THE BASKET OF DEPLORABLES COMMENT.\nBECAUSE TRUMP SEEMS TO THINK THAT THIS IS A GOOD -- IT'S A\nGOOD PIECE OF TURF FOR HIM, THAT HE CAN ENERGIZE HIS SUPPORTERS,\nSAY HILLARY CLINTON WAS INSULTING YOU, GET THEM RILED UP\nA LITTLE BIT. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THEN THE\nCONVERSATION IS, HOW MANY OF TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS ARE IN THE\nBASKET OF DEPLORABLES? >> IT'S NOT HALF.\nIS IT A THIRD, A QUARTER? >> AS YOU SAID, THEY HAVE\nDISAVOWED DAVID DUKE. DONALD TRUMP HAS DONE IT ON\nMULTIPLE OCCASIONS. YOUR INTERVIEW WITH HIM BACK IN\nFEBRUARY, IT WAS, I GUESS, WAS THE KICKOFF OF THAT NO DOUBT.\nBUT THEY HAVE DISAVOWED IT AS YOU'VE SAID.\nTHEY SAY WE ARE NOT INTERESTED IN THE SUPPORTERS.\nI THINK IT'S A PURE POLITICAL. THEY WANT THE WORD \"DEPLORABLE\"\nTO BE COMPLETELY OWNED BY HILLARY CLINTON NOW BECAUSE OF\nHER MISTAKE. >> TUNE INTO CNN TOMORROW NIGHT\nAT 9:00 P.M. EASTERN FOR \"ALMOST PRESIDENT, THE AGONY OF DEFEAT.\"\nTHEY WERE IN CHARGE OF HILLARY CLINTON'S PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVERS\nAND NOW THEY ARE NOT SAYING A WORD TO CONGRESS.\nONE DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER SHOWING UP ON CAPITOL HILL TODAY.\nTHAT STORY NEXT.",

ALL OF THIS WITH JUST UNDER 56\nDAYS TO GO UNTIL THE U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.\n13 DAYS OUT FROM THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE.\nTHE TWO CAMPAIGNS ARE IN VERY DIFFERENT FOOTING RIGHT NOW.\nDONALD TRUMP IS ON THE OFFENSIVE TAKING SHOTS AT HILLARY CLINTON\nOVER HER CALLING HALF OF HIS SUPPORTERS, I'M QUOTING NOW,\nDEPLORABLES.

SOMETHING, WOLF, THAT TOUCH ADD\nNERVE WITH A NUMBER OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS.\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN KNOWS THAT. TRUMP CRITICIZED CLINTON FOR\nTHIS LAST NIGHT. HE'S GOING TO DO IT AGAIN TODAY\nWHEN WHEN HE TAKE AS STAGE A FEW MOMENTS FROM NOW.\nEXPECT MORE CRITICISM. HE SAYS IT'S MORE EVIDENCE THAT\nHILLARY CLINTON IS OUT OF TOUCH WITH WORKING-CLASS VOTERS.\nSO MORE CRITICISM OF CLINTON TODAY.\nTONIGHT, THOUGH, WOLF, WE SHOULD TELL YOU, TRUMP WILL BE TALKING\nPOLICY WHEN HE'S IN PENNSYLVANIA.\nHE'LL BE UNVEILING HIS CHILD CARE AFFORDABILITY PLAN, HIS\nDAUGHTER IVANKA TRUMP PLANNING TO JOIN HIM.\nSHE'S BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN PUTTING TOGETHER THIS PLAN.\nSO TONIGHT IT'S GOING TO BE POLICY, BUT TODAY HERE IN IOWA,\nIT'S GOING TO BE ALL THAT CRITICISM AND HILLARY CLINTON\nAND THAT DEPLORABLES COMMENT.

THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES IS SPEAKING LATER THIS HOUR THERE.\nWE'RE TOLD HE'LL BE HITTING DONALD TRUMP PRETTY HARD AS\nWELL. WHAT ARE YOU HEARING ABOUT THE\nTONE, THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT WILL SAY?\n>> Reporter: WE KNOW GENERALLY THE PRESIDENT LIKES TO STAY OUT\nOF THE FRAY. HE DOESN'T LIKE TO, EVEN MENTION\nHIS NAME, WHEN OUT IN A PUBLIC EVENT LIKE THIS.\nHE WILL REFER, THOUGH, TO THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE.\nIN A SETTING LIKE THIS HE LIKES TO GIVE THESE KINDS OF DIGS,\nSOMETIMES USING HUMOR TO GET THE CROWD GOING.\nKIND OF LIKE AN ASIDE. HINT, HINT, WE ALL KNOW WHO I'M\nTALKING ABOUT, RIGHT? IT'S A PRESS CONFERENCE SETTING\nHE IS ASKED QUESTIONS DIRECTLY ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS DONALD\nTRUMP HAS SAID THAT HE GETS MORE CUTTING.\nTHAT HE REALLY GETS CRITICAL. RECENTLY WE HEARD HIM SAY THAT\nDONALD TRUMP IS NOT QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES. AND THE PRESIDENT SAID HE PROVES\nTHAT EVERY TIME HE OPENS HIS MOUTH.\nI DON'T KNOW HE'S GOING TO BE THAT CRITICAL HERE.\nI MEAN, AT AN EVENT LIKE THIS, WHERE HE HAS HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE\nGATHERED, HERE IN PHILADELPHIA, AT THE ART MUSEUM, THE STEPS,\nKNOWN AS THE ROCKY STEPS, E HAD LIKES TO KEEP THE TONE POSITIVE.\nLIKES TO BOOST HILLARY CLINTON. TRY TO REV THE BASE UP, GET\nPEOPLE OUT TO VOTE. THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE WHITE\nHOUSE SEES PRESIDENT OBAMA'S NUMBER ONE GOAL BEING.\nNOT NECESSARILY TO TRY TO WIN VOTERS AWAY FROM DONALD TRUMP.\nI MEAN, LOOK AT THIS. OBVIOUSLY HE'S PREACHING TO THE\nCHOIR, BUT THEY SEE HIM AS MOTIVATING PEOPLE TO GET THE\nVOTE OUT. THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY GOING TO BE\nCRITICAL, OF COURSE IN THIS TIGHT RACE, WOLF.\n>> THIS IS THE FIRST TIME, MICHELLE THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS\nGONE OUT ON HIS OWN, SOLO, TO CAMPAIGN FOR HILLARY CLINTON,\nBUT WHAT DO WE EXPECT IN THE WEEKS TO COME BETWEEN NOW AND\nNOVEMBER 8th, THE DAY OF THE ELECTION?\n>> Reporter: I MEAN, WE DID EXPECT TO SEE MORE.\nREMEMBER A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO TALKING HOW PRESIDENT OBAMA\nWOULD LIKELY BE THE MOST ACTIVE PRESIDENT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL\nIN HISTORY, BUT WE REALLY HAVEN'T SEEN THAT.\nMAINLY BECAUSE OF HIS SCHEDULE. REMEMBER THAT FIRST EVENT\nPLANNED WITH HILLARY CLINTON HAD TO BE POSTPONED BECAUSE OF THE\nORLANDO SHOOTINGS. SO SOME UNFORESEEN EVENTS GOT IN\nTHE WAY AS WELL. THAT WAS SUCH A DIFFICULT TIME\nTHAT HE HAD TO FOCUS ON AND KIND OF COOL THINGS OFF A LITTLE BIT.\nAND WE SAW HIM OUT WITH HILLARY IN JULY AND, OF COURSE, TWO\nMONTHS AGO ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL THAT SEEMS LIKE AN ETERNITY, BUT\nHIS SCHEDULE IS STILL DIFFICULT THIS MONTH.\nWE JUST GOT BACK FROM A FOREIGN TRIP.\nHE HAS THE U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY COMING UP.\nIT'S REALLY GOING TO BE OCTOBER THAT WE SEE HIM ACTIVE.\nAND WE'VE SEEN REPORTS OUT THERE AND PEOPLE SPECULATING THAT HE\nMIGHT SPEND VIRTUALLY THE ENTIRE MONTH OUT ON THE TRAIL.\nOUR SOURCES SAY THAT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE POSSIBLE, FOR IT\nTO BE THAT THAT EXTENT, WE SURELY CAN EXPECT TO SEE MUCH,\nMUCH MORE OF HIM AS SOON AS WE SEE OCTOBER, WOLF.\n>> LIVE COVERAGE OF HIS REMARKS COMING UP.\nMICHELLE KACZYNSKI, THANK YOU. AND JASON CARROLL WITH DONALD\nTRUMP EXPECTED TO SPEAK MOMENTARILY.\nTHANK YOU TO YOU AS WELL. TRADING BLOWS OVER WHOSE\nCAMPAIGN IS LESS TRANSPARENT. IN AN INTERVIEW WITH CNN'S\nRNDSON COOPER, HILLARY CLINTON TRIED TO TURNTA THE TABLES ON\nTRUMP. >> YOU'VE GOT A MEDICAL REPORT\nON ME THAT MEETS THE SAME STANDARD AT MITT ROMNEY AND\nBARACK OBAMA. DONALD TRUMP'S DOCTOR SAID HE'D\nBE THE HEALTHIEST PRESIDENT IN HISTORY.\nTHAT'S JUST NOT EVEN SERIOUS. AND I'VE RELEASED NEARLY 40\nYEARS OF TAX RETURNS. HE HASN'T RELEASED ONE.\nTHIS IS A MAN WITH UNKNOWN NUMBERS OF PARTNERS AND\nINVESTORS WHO SAYS HE'S DOING 120 FOREIGN DEALS.\nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE TO KNOW WHAT HE'S UP TO AND WHAT HE\nIS HIDING. >> LET'S BRING IN OUR PANEL, OUR\nSENIOR POLITICAL REPORTER WITH US, \"TIME\" MAGAZINE POLITICAL\nREPORTER ZEKE MILLER AND \"WASHINGTON POST\" REPORTER ED\nO'KEEFE. THANKS FOR JOINING US.\nIS THIS AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY WE SAW HER DISPLAY LAST NIGHT IN\nTHE PHONE INTERVIEW WITH ANDERSON COOPER?\n>> I THINK SO. WE OBVIOUSLY KNOW SHE HAS\nTRANSPARENCY PROBLEMS AND THEY SHOW UP IN TRUSTWORTHY NUMBERS,\nIN THIS EPISODE WITH THE HEALTH ISSUE MAGNIFIED NAP IN TURNS THE\nTABLES ON DONALD TRUMP SHE HAS TO MAKE SURE HE'S GETTING\nQUESTIONS ABOUT HIS TAX RETURNS, THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN PUSHED THIS IDEA LONG AGO THAT DONALD TRUMP\nDOESN'T HAVE, ISN'T JUDGED BY THE SAME STANDARDS.\nRIGHT? THAT HE GETS A PASS ON MANY OF\nTHESE THINGS. THE PRESS SOMETIMES LET'S HIM\nGET A PASS. SO I THINK IN TRYING TO TURN THE\nCONVERSATION TO DONALD TRUMP, IT IS AFFECTED, AND WE'VE SEEN\nDONALD TRUMP TRYING TO DO THE SAME THING WITH HER.\nI THINK IT ALSO WATERS DOWN HIS KEY ARGUMENT ABOUT HER WHICH IS\nTHAT SHE'S THE ONE WHO'S GOT SOMETHING TO HIDE, SHE'S THE ONE\nLOOKING IN TRANSPARENCY. I THINK WE'LL CONTINUE TO SEE\nHER DO THAT AND DONALD TRUMP. >> HE'S UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE,\nZEKE TO RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS. SAYS HE CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE\nHE'S STILL UNDER IRS AUDIT. EARLIER THIS MORNING ON CNN'S\n\"NEW DAY\" ALISON CAM WRK ALSOAL CAMEROTA SAID --\n>> ARE YOU CALLING HIM A LIAR? >> TAKING HIS WORD FOR.\n>> IT AND TAKING HILLARY CLINTON'S WORD SHE WAS\nOVERHEATED AND DIDN'T HAVE PNEUMONIA OR IS GOING TO BE\nASPIRATIONAL, UPLIFTING, START TALKING TO THE PRESS.\nSERIOUSLY, WE'RE RUNNING AGAINST A CLINTON AND GOING TO CHALLENGE\nSOMEONE'S VERACITY? >> THAT WAS CAMPAIGN MANAGER\nKELLYANNE CONWAY BASICALLY SAYING HE'S UNDER AUDIT.\nARE YOU CALLING HIM A LIAR, IF YOU WANT PROOF.\nTHIS IS A SENSITIVE ISSUE FOR BOTH OF THESE CAMPAIGNS BUT\nHILLARY CLINTON RELEASED 20 YEARS OF HER IRS RETURNS.\n>> A LOT OF PLACE, IT'S BEEN A RACE TO THE BOT WHUM IT COMES TO\nPRESS ACCESS, TRANSPARENCY, VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE OF ANY SORT\nOF INFORMATION. FOR INSTANCE, THE BASKET OF\nDEPLORABLES COMMENT AT A FUND-RAISER HILLARY CLINTON HAD.\nTRADITIONALLY THESE, SPEAKING OF BREAKING WITH THE PRESIDENT FROM\nMITT ROMNEY AND PRESIDENT OBAMA, HILLARY CLINTON GENERALLY\nDOESN'T ALLOW PRESS IN HER FUND-RAISERS.\nIN TERMS OF GETTING INFORMATION OUT TO THE PRESS IN A TIMELY\nMANNER, SUNDAY MORNING, THE HEALTH EPISODE, SHE WAITED A\nWHILE BEFORE TELLING THE PRESS ABOUT IT.\nDONALD TRUMP AND TAX RETURNS, YES, ASKING PEOPLE TO TRUST HIM,\nAND YES, HE DOES GET A BUSINESS OF A PASS, MOSTLY FROM VOTERS,\nNOT THE PRESS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS NOW.\nHIS VOTERS RIGHT NOW DON'T CARE HE'S NOT RELEASING TAX RETURNS.\n>> THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES ARRIVING IN PHILADELPHIA,\nJUST MOMENTS AGO. HE'LL SPEAK SHORTLY, LATER THIS\nHOUR, IN PHILADELPHIA TO CAMPAIGN RALLY IN SUPPORT OF\nHILLARY CLINTON. ED, IS THERE ANY INDICATION AT\nALL YOU COVERED THIS VERY WELL, THAT DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO\nRELEASE AT LEAST SOME ASPECTS OF HIS TAX RETURNS?\nEASTERN THE YEARS THAT ARE, THAT ALREADY HAVE BEEN AUDITED?\nUP TO 2008. HE COULD RELEASE THOSE.\nHE COULD ALSO JUST RELEASE THE PERCENTAGE OF TAX HE PAID THE\nCHARITIABILITY CONTRIBUTIONS HE MADE.\nHE COULD RELEASE THAT KIND OF INFORMATION WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING\nHIS AUDIT? >> I'D SAY THE \"WASHINGTON POST\"\nHAS BEEN LOOKING AT THIS SPECIFICALLY, MY COLLEAGUE WOULD\nBE THRILLED TO SEE ALL THAT INFORMATION, BECAUSE IT'S LED TO\nREAMS OF REPORTING THAT INCLUDE NO COMMENT FROM THE CAMPAIGN,\nAND THUS LEAVES ALL OF THESE QUESTIONS OPEN.\nHE ABSOLUTELY COULD, AND MEDICAL INFORMATION AS WELL.\nTHE EXCUSE OF, WE, I MAY NOT HAVE GIVEN ANYTHING, BUT HE'S\nWORSE. SORRY.\nEVERYONE AT THIS TABLE, EVERYONE IN THIS BUILDING AND EVERY NEWS\nORGANIZATION SHOULD BE FURIOUS WITH BOTH OF THESE CAMPAIGNS FOR\nBEING SO SECRETIVE, FRANKLY, ABOUT THIS STUFF, AND IT WAS\nENCOURAGING TO SEE THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN ADMIT OVER THE WEEKEND\nPERHAPS THEY STUMBLED A BIT INFORMING US'S ALL OF THESE\nTHINGS BUT NO EXCUSE.

THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE\nUNDER THE MICROSCOPE FOR 40 YEARS.\nBUT WHAT SETS HILLARY APART IS THROUGH IT ALL SHE KEEPS GOING\nAND SHE DOESN'T STOP CARING AND SHE DOESN'T STOP TRYING AND SHE\nNEVER STOPS FIGHTING FOR US EVEN IF WE HAVEN'T ALWAYS APPRECIATED\nHER. WE ARE A YOUNG COUNTRY, WE ARE A\nRESTLESS COUNTRY. WE LIKE THE NEW SHINY THING.\nI BENEFITED FROM THAT WHEN I WAS A CANDIDATE AND WE TAKE FOR\nGRANTED SOMETIMES WHAT IS STUDY AND TRUE.\nAND HILLARY CLINTON'S STEADY AND SHE IS TRUE.\n[ APPLAUSE ] AND THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE\nHERE, WHO ALL YOU'VE BEEN SEEING IS JUST THE NONSENSE THAT'S BEEN\nON TV, YOU MAYBE DON'T REMEMBER ALL THE WORK THAT SHE HAS HAD TO\nDO AND ALL THE THINGS SHE HAS HAD TO OVERCOME AND ALL THE GOOD\nTHAT HAS HAPPENED BECAUSE OF HER EFFORTS.\nBUT YOU NEED TO REMEMBER, YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THIS.\nIF YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT OUR DEMOCRACY THEN YOU'VE GOT TO BE\nWITH HER. SHE'S IN THE ARENA AND YOU CAN'T\nLEAVE HER IN THERE BY HERSELF. YOU HAVE TO GET IN THERE WITH\nHER. [ APPLAUSE ]\nYOU CAN'T STAY HOME BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG\nTIME. YOU KNOW WHAT?\nTHIS IS NOT REALITY TV. DEMOCRACY IS NOT A SPECTATOR\nSPORT. YOU DON'T TWEET IN YOUR VOTE.\nAMERICA'S NOT ABOUT YES HE WILL, IT'S ABOUT YES WE CAN.\nYES WE CAN. YES WE CAN.\nCREATE MORE GOOD JOBS. YES WE CAN CREATE BETTER\nSCHOOLS, YES WE CAN CREATE SAFER STREETS.\nYES WE CAN CREATE A MORE SECURE WORLD.\nWE CAN BRING ABOUT REAL CHANGE AND REAL PROGRESS THE TIME HAS\nCOME FOR ME TO PASS THE BATON ON BUT HILLARY CLINTON WILL RUN\nTHAT RACE AND SHE WILL FINISH THAT RACE AND THAT'S WHY I'M\nWITH HER, THAT'S WHY I'M FIRED UP, THAT'S WHY I'M READY TO GO\nAND I NEED YOU TO JOIN ME. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]\nI NEED YOU TO WORK AS HARD FOR HILLARY AS YOU DID FOR ME.\n[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] .\nI NEED YOU TO KNOCK ON DOORS. I NEED YOU TO MAKE PHONE CALLS.\nYOU HAVE TO TALK TO YOUR FRIENDS, INCLUDING YOUR\nREPUBLICAN FRIENDS. YOU NEED TO GO TO IWILLVOTE.COM\nAND REGISTER TO VOTE BY OCTOBER 11.\nTHEN YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE POLLS AND GET PEOPLE TO GO TO THE\nPOLLS AND IF YOU'RE WILLING TO DO THAT WITH ME IS WE'LL WIN IN\nNOVEMBER. WE'LL ELECT HILLARY CLINTON THE\nNEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES\n[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE WILL CONTINUE ON THIS JOURNEY\nTO CREATE A BETTER AMERICA AND A FAIRER AMERICA, A MORE JUST\nAMERICA, A MORE LOVING AMERICA, A BRIGHTER AMERICA.\nTHAT'S WHAT WE'RE FIGHTING FOR. THAT'S WHY I NEED YOU.\nLET'S GET BUSY, LET'S GET TO WORK.\nTHANK YOU, PHILADELPHIA. GOT BLESS YOU, GOT BLESS THE\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]\n>> PRESIDENT OBAMA, THIS IS SIGNIFICANT.\nTHIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE SEEN HIM AS A SOLO APPEARANCE\nSTUMPING FOR HILLARY CLINTON. HE WANTS TO, AS HE JUST SAID,\nPASS THE BATON ON, THERE HE IS IN PHILADELPHIA.\nREALLY ECHOES OF THEN SENATOR OBAMA RUNNING FOR REELECTION IN\n2012 HEARING THINGS LIKE \"DON'T BOO, VOTE.\"\n\"FIRED UP READY TO GO.\" THE CROWD CHANTING \"YES WE CAN.\"\nTRYING TO FIRE UP THE ELECTORATE.\nTELLING THEM WHY THE MAN WHO, ODDLY ENOUGH, WE'VE BEEN\nWATCHING IN THE LITTLE BOX ON THE SCREEN SPEAKING AT THE SAME\nTIME, DONALD TRUMP, WHY HE THINKS HE IS NOT THE MAN TO BE\nTHE NEXT COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF HE ALSO CRITICIZED THE GUYS IN THE\nBACK, THE PRESS. LET'S GET INTO ALL OF THAT.\nI HAVE SUSAN PAGE WITH ME, THE WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF FOR \"USA\nTODAY\" NOW COVERING HER NINTH PRESIDENTIAL RACE.\nWE'LL STAY ON THESE PICTURES. CNN SENIOR POLITICAL REPORTER\nNIA-MALIKA HENDERSON. CRISCO ADVANTAGE WHO SUPPORTS\nDONALD TRUMP. HILARY ROSEN A, A DEMOCRATIC\nSTRATEGIST WHO SUPPORTS HILLARY CLINTON AND WITH ME HERE ON SET\nWHO COVERED OBAMA THE LAST COUPLE OF ROUNDS JEFF ZELENY.\nSUSAN PAGE, I DEFER TO YOU AS YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH AS WE\nMENTIONED, WHAT, NINE ELECTIONS AND LISTENING TO PRESIDENT ON\nHIS TALK OF TRANSPARENCY, OF A DOUBLE STANDARD, WHAT JUMPED OUT\nAT YOU? >> I'VE COVERED NINE, THIS IS MY\nTENTH. NEVER IN THOSE CAMPAIGNS HAVE\nYOU HAD AN INCUMBENT PRESIDENT CAMPAIGN WITH THAT KIND OF\nENTHUSIASM FOR HIS PARTY'S NOMINEE TO SUCCEED.\nFOR VARIOUS REASONS AL GORE DIDN'T WANT BILL CLINTON OUT\nTHERE. JOHN McCAIN DID NOT WANT GEORGE\nW. BUSH OUT THERE. THIS IS A CASE WHERE BARACK\nOBAMA ALIGNS WITH HILLARY CLINTON'S POSITION.\nHE WANTS YOUNGER VOTERS AND AFRICAN-AMERICANS TO TURN OUT IN\nSIGNIFICANT NUMBERS. YOU SAW HIS POWER TO DO THAT IN\nTHAT RALLY WE JUST WATCHED IN PHILADELPHIA.\n>> NIA, WHAT DID YOU ANY WHY IS HE IN PHILADELPHIA, TOO?\n>> PHILADELPHIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN GOOD TO DEMOCRATS.\nYOU THINK ABOUT 2008, BARACK OBAMA DREW 35,000 FOLKS THERE IN\n2004 JOHN KERRY WAS THERE WITH BILL CLINTON, DREW A CROWD OF\nLIKE 100,000. IT'S THE CENTER OF THAT\nPENNSYLVANIA GETOUT-THE-VOTE MACHINE FOR DEMOCRATS AND\nDEMOCRATS NEED TO WIN PENNSYLVANIA THIS GO ROUND IF\nTHEY'RE TO CONTINUE OBAMA'S LEGACY AND HAVE HILLARY CLINTON\nTAKE THE WHITE HOUSE. HE WAS FEELING IT OUT THERE.\nTHIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO HAS A 58% APPROVAL RATING ACCORDING TO\nTHIS \"WASHINGTON POST\" POLL THAT CAME OUT JUST RECENTLY.\nAND I THOUGHT HE VERY EFFECTIVELY PICKED APART SOME OF\nDONALD TRUMP'S ARGUMENTS. HE WAS MOCKING HIM.\nHE TALKED ABOUT THE BIZARRENESS, HE FRAMED IT THAT WAY, OF DONALD\nTRUMP SEEING PUTIN AS A ROLE MODEL.\nHE TALKED ABOUT THIS IDEA OF DONALD TRUMP BEING A CHAMPION OF\nWORKING CLASS. AMERICANS, BUT YET SOMEONE WHO\nWOULDN'T LET WORKING CLASS AMERICANS IN HIS BUILDINGS OR\nSOMEONE WHO WOULDN'T LET WORKING CLASS AMERICANS ON TO HIS GOLF\nCOURSES. I THOUGHT HE WAS SO EFFECTIVE\nHERE IN THIS CROWD TODAY AND I AM SURE THE HILLARY CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN IS PLEASED AND WANTS TO SEE HIM OUT THERE MORE AND MORE\nAND IN OCTOBER HE WILL BE OUT THERE MUCH MORE.\n>> HIS LINE -- HE WAS SORT OF ON A ROLL GETTING THE CROWD TO\nLAUGH, TALKING ABOUT -- WHEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT VLADIMIR PUTIN\nAS A ROLE MODEL AND TALKING ABOUT SADDAM HUSSEIN AND SAYING,\nLISTEN, IF YOU JAIL DISSIDENTS AND YOU CONTROL THE MEDIA, YOU'D\nHAVE A 90% APPROVAL RATING, TOO. CHRIS KOVAC, TO YOU.\nWE HEARD ABOUT THIS TRANSPARENCY WHEN HILLARY CLINTON WAS ON THE\nPHONE WITH ANDERSON COOPER, WE HEARD IT WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA,\nTHIS LACK OF TRANSPARENCY WHEN IT COMES TO YOUR CANDIDATE.\nDO YOU AGREE WITH THAT? WE JUST DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP. >> WELL, I MEAN, I THINK THAT'S\nA HARD CHARGE FOR THE HILLARY CAMPAIGN AND BY EXTENSION\nPRESIDENT OBAMA TO MAKE, TOO, BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL OF THE\nDESTROYED E-MAILS ON HILLARY'S PART AND THE LACK OF\nTRANSPARENCY -- >> TAX RETURNS, MEDICAL RECORDS,\nTWO EXAMPLES THEY WOULD THROW BACK AT YOU.\n>> RIGHT, BUT I'M SAYING -- RIGHT, EXACTLY.\nTHERE'S NO QUESTION TRUMP HAS SAID YOU WILL SEE THE TAX\nRETURNS AFTER THE AUDIT IS DONE. I'M SURE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WILL\nBE HAPPY TO PUT OUT MEDICAL RECORDS IN LIGHT OF THE RECENT\nDIFFICULTIES WITH .\nI DON'T THINK THERE WILL BE A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY THERE.\nI'LL SAY THIS ABOUT OBAMA -- >> HANG ON.\nWHEN YOU BRING UP THE MEDICAL RECORDS.\nDO WE KNOW HOW FAR BACK, HOW DETAILED THE TRUMP MEDICAL\nRECORDS WILL BE WHEN THEY'RE RELEASED THIS WEEK?\n>> I DON'T KNOW HOW FAR. I HAVEN'T GOTTEN ANY INFORMATION\nON THAT. BUT I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IN\nTHEY'RE PRETTY SIGNIFICANT. LET ME SAY THIS.\nI THINK HAVING OBAMA SPEAK ON BEHALF OF HILLARY WAS A SMART\nMOVE BECAUSE ONE OF THE MAIN PROBLEMS WE'VE SEEN IN THIS\nENTIRE CAMPAIGN YEAR FOR THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS AN\nENTHUSIASM GAP. REMEMBER IN THE REPUBLICAN\nPRIMARIES TRUMP BROUGHT ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE OUT OF THE\nWOODWORK AND HAD HUGE RECORD-SETTING NUMBERS.\nON THE DEMOCRAT SIDE YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT.\nSO OBAMA HAS THE ABILITY TO MOTIVATE PEOPLE AND GET THEM\nEXCITED FOR HILLARY, THE BASE, THAT IS, PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY\nTHINKING ABOUT VOTING FOR HILLARY BUT IT'S A DOUBLE-EDGED\nSWORTD BECAUSE IT REINFORCES HILLARY WILL BE A THIRD OBAMA\nTERM AND I DON'T THINK THEY'RE RUNNING AWAY FROM THAT ANYMORE\nIN THE HILLARY CAMPAIGN AND THAT PLAYS INTO TRUMP'S ARGUMENT\nTHAT, LOOK, I CAN BLAME THE WAGE STAGNATION ON HILLARY, I CAN\nBLAME THE POOR ECONOMY, OUR WEAKNESS ABROAD ON HILLARY\nBECAUSE SHE'S EMBRACING THE IDEA THAT SHE WILL BE THE THIRD OBAMA\nTERM. SO IT HAS A NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCE\nFOR THE CAMPAIGN. >> I THINK ON ECONOMICS, HE\nBROUGHT UP THE NEW NUMBERS WITH REGARD TO THE MEDIAN INCOME\nGOING UP TO $56,000. HIS LINE WAS REPUBLICANS DON'T\nLIKE TO HEAR GOOD NEWS RIGHT NOW.\nSO HILARY ROSEN, I WANT YOU TO RESPOND TO THAT BUT I WANT YOU\nTO RESPOND TO OBAMA'S POINT WHEN HE WAS SAYING HILLARY CLINTON IS\nSUBJECTED TO MORE SCRUTINY, MORE CRITICISM, THAT THERE IS A\nDOUBLE STANDARD. >> AND LET'S REMEMBER THAT\nPRESIDENT OBAMA HAS A MAJORITY APPROVAL RATING IN THIS COUNTRY,\nMUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT SO IF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WILL TRY TO HANG\nHIM AROUND HILLARY'S NECK THEY'LL BE SURPRISED BECAUSE\nHE'S QUITE POPULAR, PARTICULARLY IN THE STATES DONALD TRUMP HAS\nTO WIN TO OVERCOME HER LEAD. I THINK WE GET TO THIS POINT NOW\nIN THE RACE WHERE HILLARY CLINTON IS GOING TO BE MORE\nPROACTIVE, MORE POSITIVE ABOUT THE CHANGES SHE'S GOING TO MAKE\nIN THIS COUNTRY AND I THOUGHT PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS VERY\nARTICULATE IN SAYING ESSENTIALLY LOOK AT DONALD TRUMP'S RECORD.\nHE'S CHEATED PEOPLE, HIS FOUNDATION DIDN'T JUST TAKE\nOTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY BUT IT BOUGHT A SIX-FOOT-TALL PAINTING\nOF HIMSELF. THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF GIEP\nWHO'S GOING TO COME UP WITH POLICIES TO HELP YOU, THE\nMIDDLE-CLASS, IN PENNSYLVANIA. >> ON THE ENTHUSIASM POINT,\nTHOUGH, LET ME BOUNCE BACK WHEN KRIS MENTIONED THAT, THAT'S A\nVALID CRITICISM OF HILLARY CLINTON THUS FAR, ESPECIALLY\nAMONG SOME YOUNG FOLKS. JEFF ZELENY, YOU SAW PRESIDENT\nOBAMA, YOU COVERED HIM, YOU WERE SHOWING ME A PICTURE IN '08 AND\nYOU REMEMBER THESE SIMILAR CHORUSES WHICH BROUGHT ABOUT\nENTHUSIASM, ESPECIALLY FROM YOUNG PEOPLE \"YES, WE CAN.\"\n>> WITHOUT A DOUBT. HE'S HOPING THE RESPONSE IS THE\nSAME. YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THERE ARE\nSO MANY MILLENNIALS WHO DIDN'T GET THE CHANCE TO VOTE FOR HIM\nSO HE'S OFFERING THEM A CHANCE TO VOTE FOR THIS THIRD TERM.\nI COULD NOT V IMAGINED SITTING HERE A YEAR OR SO AGO THINKING\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN WOULD HAVE BEEN OKAY RUNNING FOR A THIRD\nOBAMA TERM. AND NOW THEY ARE BECAUSE OF THE\nECONOMIC NUMBERS AND OTHER THINGS AND BECAUSE HE'S SO\nDIFFERENT THAN MR. TRUMP. BUT WHAT'S STRIKING HERE IS\nWE'VE NEVER SEEN IF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S TRANSLATES TO OTHER\nCANDIDATES BEFORE. IT DIDN'T IN 2010 WHEN HE LOST\nCONTROL OF THE SENATE. IT CERTAINLY DIDN'T IF 2014.\nTHIS IS A BIGGEST TEST, I THINK, OF HIS TRANSFERABILITY HERE.\nCAN SOME OF THOSE VOTERS -- WILL THEY FOLLOW HIM AND JOIN HIM?\nHE DOESN'T NEED TO GET EVERYONE, HE JUST NEEDS TO GET THAT OLD\nBAND BACK TOGETHER, THE OBAMA COALITION OF VOTERS.\nTHOO'S WHY HE'S IN PHILLY REGISTERING PEOPLE TO VOTE.\nTHAT'S WHY HE'S HERE AND MICHELLE OBAMA IS IN VIRGINIA ON\nFRIDAY. HE'S THE MOST VALUABLE PLAYER IN\nTHIS CAMPAIGN BUT IT'S A BIG TEST FOR HIM AND HIS LEGACY AS\nWELL. >> JUST ONE QUICK THING ON THE\nENTHUSIASM GAPS WHICH THAT, YOU KNOW, NO ONE, MILLENNIALS OR\nSENIOR CITIZENS, COULD BE WATCHING THIS CAMPAIGN AND JUST\nFEEL GOOD ABOUT IT. THIS IS NOT A CAMPAIGN THAT'S\nTALKING ABOUT DIRECTLY ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY.\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS TO DO EVERYTHING SHE CAN TO MAKE IT BE\nABOUT THAT BUT THIS HAS BEEN FOR THE LAST 15 MONTHS ON THE\nREPUBLICAN SIDE AND WE'VE NOW BROUGHT IT INTO THE GENERAL A\nCAMPAIGN OF INSULTS, OF RACE BAITING, OF RELIGION BAITING.\nIT'S JUST AN UNPLEASANT THING TO EXPERIENCE, I KNOW FOR THOSE OF\nUS SITTING AROUND THAT STUDIO AND SO I CAN ONLY IMAGINE IN SO\nMANY WAYS HOW IT FEELS TO PEOPLE WHO REALLY WANT PROGRESS IN THIS\nCOUNTRY, WHO WANT TO BUILD ON THE PROGRESS OF THIS COUNTRY.\n>> ON PROGRESS, JUST QUICKLY, WE HEARD AND MENTIONED A MOMENT AGO\nHOW OBVIOUSLY PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS TOUTING THE POSITIVE\nECONOMIC NUMBERS TODAY. AS WE WERE LISTENING TO THE\nPRESIDENT, DONALD TRUMP WAS SPEAKING AS WELL.\nHE JUST SPOKE ABOUT THE ECONOMY, LET'S HEAR WHAT HE SAID.\n>> ONE IN FIVE AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS DO NOT HAVE A SINGLE\nHELP IN THE LABOR FORCE. ANOTHER 14 MILLION PEOPLE LEFT\nTHE LABOR FORCE SINCE 2009 AND THE NATIONAL DEBT HAS DOUBLED TO\nNEARLY $20 TRILLION DURING THE OBAMA YEARS.\n>> SO, ALL RIGHT, SUSAN PAGE, COMING TO YOU ON YOUR 10th\nPRESIDENTIAL ELECTION YOU'RE COVERING.\nHERE'S MORE NUMBERS JUST TO CONFUSE EVERYONE BUT IT'S\nSIGNIFICANT. THIS IS THE NEWS THAT CAME OUT\nTODAY. THIS IS FROM THE U.S. CENSUS\nBUREAU. MEDIAN INCOME IN THE U.S. GREW\nTO $56,516, THAT REPRESENTS A 5.2% RAISE FOR AMERICAN WORKERS,\nTHE FIRST GAIN SINCE 2007, ADDITIONALLY THE POVERTY RATE\nALSO DECLINED, ALL OBVIOUSLY POSITIVE NEWS, WE HEARD THE\nPRESIDENT OUT THING  TOUTING TH HE SAID YES IT TOOK TIME FOR\nCHANGE. HOW DO YOU HEAR TRUMP JUXTAPOSED\nWITH THE POSITIVE NEWS TODAY? >> THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT\nSTATISTICS FOR THE DEMOCRATS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE\nUNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS GONE DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY, DOWN BELOW 5%,\nCUT IN HALF DURING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S TENURE BUT THE STAG\nSTATION OF WAGES HAS BEEN A BIG PROBLEM FOR AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS,\nTHIS MEANS MORE AMERICANS CAN FEEL THE ECONOMY IS REALLY IN\nTHAT RECOVERY THAT WE'VE TECHNICALLY BEEN IN FOR SOME\nTIME BUT WHICH A LOT OF PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES AND\nHOUSEHOLDS HAVEN'T FELT. DEFINITELY IMPORTANT STATISTIC.\nBUT YOU SEE TWO DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF AMERICA FROM THESE\nTWO CAMPAIGNS AND WE SAW THAT IN THE TWO CONVENTIONS IN JULY, A\nMUCH MORE UPBEAT VERSION OF WHERE THE COUNTRY IS HEADED\nAMONG CLINTON SUPPORTERS AND DEMOCRATS THAN TRUMP SUPPORTERS.\nWE FOUND IN OUR LATEST POLL THAT ABOUT 6 IN 10 CLINTON SUPPORTERS\nTHINK THE COUNTRY IS HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.\n90% OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS THINK THE NATION IS HEADED IN THE\nWRONG DIRECTION. THIS MAY BE THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL\nDIVIDE BETWEEN THESE TWO CAMPAIGNS.\nKRIS KOBACH, I WANT TO PLAY THIS SOUND.\nTHIS IS FROM TRUMP TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMY, TALKING ABOUT THE\nDIFFERENT PARTIES. THIS IS FROM 2004.\n>> IT JUST SEEMS THAT THE ECONOMY DOES BETTER UNDER THE\nDEMOCRATS THAN THE REPUBLICANS. NOW IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT WAY BUT\nIF YOU GO BACK, IT JUST SEEMS THE ECONOMY DOES BETTER UNDER\nTHE DEMOCRATS BUT WE'VE HAD SOME PRETTY BAD DISASTER UNDER THE\nREPU REPUBLICANS.\n>> IT JUST SEEMS THE ECONOMY DOES BETTER UNDER THE DEMOCRATS.\nTHIS IS SOMETHING THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN GRABBED ON TO WHEN THEY\nTWEETED OUT TODAY, KRIS. >> IT IS INTERESTING.\nIF YOU LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC EBBS AND FLOWS, THE UPS AND DOWNS OF\nGDP, SOMETIMES A DEMOCRAT IS IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND SOMETIMES A\nREPUBLICAN IS BUT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME PERIODS WHEN DEMOCRATS\nHAVE BEEN IN THE WHITE HOUSE BUT I THINK WE HAVE THIS PROBABLY\nFALSE CONCEIT IN AMERICA THAT WHOEVER IS PRESIDENT HAS THE\nABILITY TO JUST BY THEIR OWN WILL SOMEHOW CHANGE THE ECONOMY,\nWE KNOW THAT IT'S A COMBINATION OF WHAT ARE THE TAX POLICIES\nCOMING OUT OF CONGRESS, WHAT IS THE PRESIDENT DOING?\nSO IT'S A VARIETY OF THINGS. >> BUT TRUMP WASN'T SAYING THAT.\nI HEAR YOU ON THE NUANCE AND THE DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATIONS BUT\nTRUMP IS SPEAKING IN A BIT MORE GENERAL TERMS SAYING IT JUST\nSEEMS THE ECONOMY DOES BETTER UNDER THE DEMOCRATS.\nWE'VE HAD SOME PRETTY BAD DISASTERS UNDER THE REPUBLICANS.\nHIS OWN WORDS. >> I THINK HE WAS PROBABLY\nTALKING ABOUT THE WAY I READ IT, WHEN A DEMOCRAT IS SITTING IN\nTHE WHITE HOUSE BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE THE SECOND TERM OF THE\nCLINTON ADMINISTRATION YOU HAD REPUBLICANS BALANCING THE BUDGET\nIN CONGRESS, CLINTON SIGNING THAT BUDGET AND SO YOU HAD SOME\nGOOD YEARS BUT A LOT OF IT HAD TO DO WITH REPUBLICAN FISCAL\nCONSERVATISM. SO IT'S HARD TO GENERALIZE LIKE\nTHAT. BOTTOM LINE IS TRUMP IS -- GO\nAHEAD. >> GO AHEAD, HILLARY.\n>> I WAS GOING TO SAY MUCH OF IT HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT\nWHEN THE REPUBLICANS WERE IN CHARGE THEY DROVE UP THE\nDEFICITS BY CREATING HUGE TAX CUTS ACROSS THE BOARD.\nCREATING A BIG VACUUM IN THE ECONOMY AND ESSENTIALLY CRASHING\nTHE LABOR FORCE. AND SO THAT IS -- AND THEN, YOU\nKNOW, TRUMP STARTED TO MAKE MORE MONEY WHEN DEMOCRATS CAME INTO\nOFFICE. THAT'S WHAT HE'S SAYING AND YET\nWHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO NOW IS TO SUGGEST THAT IS THOSE SAME\nPOLICIES, THOSE SAME ADVISORS, THOSE SAME ACROSS-THE-BOARD TAX\nCUTS ARE SOMEHOW GOING TO CREATE A DIFFERENT SITUATION FOR THE\nMIDDLE-CLASS VOTER, IT'S NOT TRUE.\n>> I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING, PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS QUESTIONING\nHOW DONALD TRUMP WOULD BE CHAMPIONING WORKING CLASS\nPEOPLE, NIA, TO YOU. QUESTIONING THE APPEAL OF\nWORKING AMERICANS TO MR. TRUMP. SEEMED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT.\n>> I THINK THAT WAS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE LINES IN HIS\nSPEECH TODAY, ESSENTIALLY TAKING ONE OF TRUMP'S ARGUMENTS AND HIS\nSELLING POINT THAT HE ALONE CONDITIONED K DO IT AND HE IS\nTHE VOICE FOR SO MANY VOICELESS AND SAYING WELL, WHAT HAVE YOU\nDONE SO STAR IN THAT REGARD AND I THINK DONALD TRUMP AND HIS\nSUPPORTERS WILL SAY LISTEN, HE'S CREATED X NUMBER OF JOBS AS A\nBUSINESSMAN BUT I DO THINK IT'S FAIR TO LOOK AT THOSE BUSINESS\nPRACTICES, TO SEE IF HE'S INVESTED.\nFOR INSTANCE, HE'S GOING TO DETROIT SAYING HE WANTS TO\nINVEST IN THOSE COMMUNITIES, WELL HE HADN'T DONE THAT ALREADY\nAS A BUSINESS PERSON SO I THINK OBAMA'S TONE, THE KIND OF\nMOCKERY AND THE QUESTIONING I THINK IS A SMART ONE AND I THINK\nEVEN THIS AD THAT YOU SEE TODAY WITH DONALD TRUMP SAYING\nDEMOCRATS DO IT BETTER, HE SOUNDS LIKE BILL CLINTON'S\nSPEECH FROM 2012 AND YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT IF YOU'RE A\nDEMOCRAT YOU'LL MAKE THAT INTO AN AD BECAUSE THERE YOU HAVE\nDONALD TRUMP ARGUING THE DEMOCRATIC POLICIES ARE BETTER\nFOR THE ECONOMY. >> FINAL QUESTION, JEFF ZELENY,\nTO YOU. SHE MENTIONED BILL CLINTON IN\nTERMS OF PEOPLE ON THE TRAIL THIS WEEK BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY\nHILLARY CLINTON IS RECOUPING FROM PNEUMONIA, HER HUSBAND WILL\nBE AT FUND-RAISERS IN BEVERLY HILLS, WHO ARE THE BIG NAMES?\n>> THE BIGGEST NAME IS THE ONE WE SAW RIGHT THERE IN\nPENNSYLVANIA BUT TIM KAINE WAS IN MICHIGAN, CHELSEA CLINTON HAS\nTWO STOPS TODAY IN NORTH CAROLINA SO REALLY THE ENTIRE\nDEMOCRATIC BENCH HAS BEEN OUT THERE AND HILLARY CLINTON HAS\nBEEN UP WITH ADS BUT I THINK THE KEY TAKEAWAY HERE, PRESIDENT\nOBAMA I AM TOLD BY HIS ADVISORS IS SO SERIOUS ABOUT THIS, AND WE\nHEARD HIM SAY HE'S LIKE I AM REALLY, REALLY, REALLY INTO\nELECTING HER. HE IS PRETTY MUCH CLEARING HIS\nCALENDAR TO THE EXTENT HE CAN IN OCTOBER TO CAMPAIGN FOR HER AND\nI THINK THAT HE MAKES PROBABLY THE BEST ARGUMENT.\nWE SAW IN 2012 AT THE CONVENTION HOW BILL CLINTON MADE THE\nARGUMENT FOR BARACK OBAMA, MADE THE ECONOMIC CASE FOR THAT.\nBARACK OBAMA IS HILLARY CLINTON'S BILL CLINTON, IF YOU\nWILL. I THINK HE CAN MAKE THE CASE\nBETTER. HE'S NOT RELATED TO HER, THEY\nUSED TO BE ADVERSARIES, I THINK HE HAS SOME CREDIBILITY HERE, AT\nLEAST WITH THAT COALITION HERE, SO SHE HAS A BIG BENCH THAT CAN\nTELL YOU HER ADVISORS WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEE HER ON THE ROAD SOON\nWHICH WE'RE TOLD WILL HAPPEN LATER THIS WEEK.\n>> JEFF ZELENY, WE ASK EVERYONE",

BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF WHAT WE'RE\nDOING, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT WORSE.\nI DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S POSSIBLY RIGHT AS FAR AS IT\nGOES. WHAT I MEAN BY FISCAL, I'LL\nEXPLAIN. FISCAL POLICIES THAT WOULD\nRESTORE LEVELS OF GROWTH SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THOSE\nDESCRIBED BY RAY DALIO AND TIM GEITNER, RESTORE THAT TO THE\nDEVELOPED WORLD IN THE ABSENCE OF FISCAL POLICIES IN TAX\nREGULATION, TRADE, EDUCATION POLICIES THAT WOULD DEAL WITH\nTHE CONSEQUENCES OF TECHNOLOGICAL -- IN THE ABSENCE\nOF THOSE POLICIES, SURE. MONETARY POLICY IS THE ONLY GAME\nIN TOWN. BUT EIGHT YEARS OF EFFORT\nEVER-DECLINING RATES AND EVER-INCREASING RADICALISM IN\nOTHER MONETARY POLICIES HAVE NOT CREATED A SUSTAINABLE,\nACCELERATING UPTICK IN GROWTH. WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IS CREATED A\nTREMENDOUS INCREASE IN HIDDEN RISK, RISK THAT INVESTORS DON'T\nEXACTLY KNOW OR HAVE FACED ABOUT THEIR HOLDINGS.\nAND I THINK IT'S A VERY DANGEROUS TIME IN THE GLOBAL\nECONOMY AND GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS.\n>> AND BY WAY OF REMINDING PEOPLE AS WELL OF 2007, WHEN I\nREAD IN JULIAN TUTT'S ACCOUNT, YOU SAT WITH THE G7, CORRECT,\nAND TOLD THEM OF YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE MARKET AT THAT POINT\nAND SAID WE LOOK AT A LOT OF THESE EXOTIC MORTGAGE\nINSTRUMENTS AND LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENING AND THINK THE BANKS\nARE ULTIMATELY GOING TO HAVE HUGE PROBLEMS AND THEY'RE\nOVERLEVERAGED AND WE WANT TO WARN YOU ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN.\nGEITNER AND OTHERS WERE IN THE ROOM, AS I UNDERSTAND, AND SORT\nOF SAID OKAY. SO, EVEN FOR PEOPLE TODAY, WHO\nMIGHT HAVE HEARD YOUR WARNINGS BEFORE, WOULD YOU SAY NOW WE'RE\nAT A POINT LIKE IN '07 WHEN THAT INDEX WAS CRACKING, WHEN YOU SEE\nBOND MARKETS CRACKING? IS NOW THAT POINT?\nIS THAT ENOUGH TO WARN PEOPLE TODAY LIKE YOU WOULD HAVE WANTED\nTO WARN THEM BACK IN 2007? >> A COMMENT OR TWO ABOUT THAT\nTIME AND THAT EPISODE. IT WASN'T JUST MYSELF AND JIMMY\nCHANOS. I PERMANENTLY WENT TO GERMANY\nBECAUSE WE HAD SEVERAL RELATIONSHIPS IN THE FINANCE, IT\nWAS PRACTITIONORS THAT HAD A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE\nTHE FINANCIAL SYSTEM WAS IN TERMS OF RISKS.\nTHE SECOND THING THAT STRUCK ME ABOUT THAT IS THE AMAZING\nARROGANCE OF THE POLICY MAKERS. THEY DIDN'T LISTEN.\nTHEY TREATED US AS IF WE WERE IGNORANT CHILDREN AND, OF\nCOURSE, THEY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. NEITHER DID THE GERMAN POLICY\nMAKERS, PARENTHETICALLY. BUT AFTER THE CRASH, IT'S ALL\nBEEN ONE WAY. THE EMERGENCY ACTION FOLLOWING\nTHE CRASH DESPITE THE FACT THAT CENTRAL BANKERS, INCLUDING, OF\nCOURSE, THE FED, HAD NO IDEA OF THE RISKS THAT WERE BUILDING,\nHAD NO IDEA OF THE VULNERABILITY OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO\nTHE CONFLUENCE OF THESE RISKS, THE STRUCTURED PRODUCTS, REAL\nESTATE BOOM ALL IN SORT OF A SELF REINFORCING DANCE, THEY HAD\nNO IDEA ABOUT THAT AND SO, TO ME, THE CREDIBILITY OF THE FED\nAND THE TREASURY, BUT THE FED GOING FORWARD WAS SEVERELY\nCHALLENGED. BUT THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF\nTHE CRASH POLICY WAS APPROPRIATE, REDUCE INTEREST\nRATES SHARPLY. STAND READY TO SUPPLY LIQUIDITY\nIN THE MIDST OF A CRASH. WELL, THE CRASH PERIOD, YOU\nKNOW, OCCURRED OVER A PERIOD OF ITS MOST INTENSE PHASE, IN A\nPERIOD OF WEEKS OR MONTHS. BY THE MIDDLE OF 2009, IT WAS\nTIME FOR A PIVOT. AND NO COUNTRY IN THE DEVELOPED\nWORLD -- AND I'M TALKING ABOUT JAPAN, EUROPE, THE UK, THE\nUNITED STATES. NO COUNTRY ACTUALLY MADE THE\nPIVOT TO THE OTHER POLICIES THAT COULD MAKE THE ECONOMY -- THAT\nCOULD RESTORE GROWTH, THAT COULD CURE THE STRUCTURAL IMPEDIMENTS\nTO GROWTH AND BRING GROWTH BACK TO SOMETHING CLOSE TO THE\nPREVIOUSLY EXPERIENCED LEVELS OF GROWTH.\nI BELIEVE THAT -- I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT IT'S JUST NOT THE\nCASE THAT THE DEVELOPED WORLD -- LET'S TALK ABOUT THE UNITED\nSTATES -- IS LIMITED TO AN ASSUMPTION OF 1 1/2 OR 2% PER\nYEAR REAL GROWTH GOING FORWARD. AND I CERTAINLY DON'T BELIEVE\nTHAT IF IT IS LIMITED IT'S BECAUSE OF DEMOGRAPHICS.\n>> SO YOU THINK IT COULD GROW AT 4% TO 5%?\n>> NO, BUT SOMETHING MORE THAN THIS 2% THAT AMERICA IS STUCK\nIN. >> ARE WE POSSIBLY AT THAT PIVOT\nPOINT IN THE U.S. NOW, FISCALLY SPEAKING?\nSHOULD DONALD TRUMP BE ELECTED PRESIDENT?\n>> WELL, I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT POLITICS AT THIS JUNCTURE.\nIN TWO MONTHS OR SO, WE'LL KNOW THE ANSWER TO THE -- WHICH\nENVELOPE OR IF BOTH OF THESE PEOPLE ARE STILL ON THE STAGE AT\nTHAT TIME. BUT WHAT I DO BELIEVE IS THAT\nPRO GROWTH POLICIES ARE POLICIES THAT COULD AND WOULD INCREASE\nGROWTH. FOR EXAMPLE, I BELIEVE IT WOULD\nHAVE BEEN VASTLY DIFFERENT FOR THE GROWTH RATE OF THE AMERICAN\nECONOMY AND THE PROBLEM OF UNDEREMPLOYMENT AND UNEMPLOYMENT\nAND THE REDUCTION IN THE LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION RATE, WHICH\nIS EVERY BIT AS IMPORTANT, PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE\nHEADLINE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, HAD MITT ROMNEY BEEN ELECTED\nPRESIDENT. THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A NUMBER\nOF POLICIES IN TAX REGULATION AND THINGS THAT I TALKED ABOUT A\nCOUPLE OF MINUTES AGO, THAT WOULD HAVE GENERATED A HIGHER\nRATE OF GROWTH AS DISTINGUISHED FROM THE CONTINUATION --\n>> FASCINAING DISCUSSION WITH ELLIOTT SINGER, TALKING ABOUT\nTHE CREDIBILITY OF THE FED, VARIOUS POLICIES THAT HE\nBELIEVED MIGHT HAVE TAKEN US -- AND MIGHT STILL TAKE THE ECONOMY\nTO A HIGHER GROWTH RATE THAN IT CURRENTLY HAS.\nARGUING ALSO THAT THE ARGUMENT FROM POLICY MAKERS THAT THINGS\nWOULD HAVE BEEN WORSE HAD THEY NOT ACTED AS THEY HAD, IN HIS\nWORDS PERHAPS IS NOT EXACTLY RIGHT.\nDOW CONTINUES IN THE SELLOFF DOWN 234.\nWHEN WE COME BACK, A LOT MORE FROM DELIVERING ALPHA, INCLUDING\nBEST IDEAS PANEL FROM SOME OF THE TOP NAMES IN INVESTING.\nMORE ON APPLE, SOME PREORDER NUMBERS ARE OUT.\nSECRETARY LEW MAKING HEADLINES ON EU TAXES AND MORE.\nDON'T GO AWAY.",

THIS IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN\nWHAT WE'RE USED TO WITH THE HYPERBOLE OF TRUMP.\nWHEN YOU MESS WITH THE MARKETS AND YOU UNDERMINE CONFIDENCE IN\nTHE ECONOMY, THAT COULD BE A BIG PROBLEM.\nHOWEVER, LET'S ARGUE WHETHER OR NOT HE'S DOING THAT.\nYOUR TAKE. TRUMP IS SAYING WHAT A LOT OF\nPEOPLE BELIEVE. IT'S RIGGED.\nTHEY'RE ALL IN ON IT IN WASHINGTON.\nTHE RATES ARE LOW. THE UNEMPLOYMENT IS REALLY 40%,\nNOT 4%. THEY'RE TRYING TO GET OVER ON\nUS, AND HE'S A TRUTH TELLER. WHAT DO YOU SAY?\n>> WRONG. I WOULD SAY THAT THE FED IS ONE\nOF THE LEAST POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS IN WASHINGTON RIGHT\nNOW. YOU KNOW, FED GOVERNORS HAVE\nLONG TERMS. THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS SET UP TO\nMAKE IT LESS POLITICAL. THE ONLY REASON THAT SOME PEOPLE\nSAY THAT THE FED HAS KEPT RATES LOW, THAT'S A POLITICAL MOVE, IS\nTHAT THEY'RE THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO\nANYTHING OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS TO GOOSE THE ECONOMY\nBECAUSE OF CONGRESSIONAL GRIDLOCK.\nIF REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS HAD BEEN ABLE TO AGREE AND WE'D GOT\nAN BIGGER FISCAL STIMULUS PLAN THROUGH, RATES PROBABLY WOULDN'T\nBE SO LOW AT THIS POINT. BUT THE FED IS WATCHING THE\nECONOMY. THEY'RE NOT SEEING A LOT OF\nINFLATION. THEY'RE SEEING KIND OF SIDEWAYS\nGROWTH. IT'S STILL ABOUT 2%.\nTHERE'S A LOT OF REASONS TO KEEP RATES LOW STILL.\n>> AND THEY DID JUST RAISE RATES.\nTHERE'S SPECULATION ABOUT WHAT THEY'LL DO GOING FORWARD.\nALL RIGHT. MAYBE YOU GET THAT POINT.\nBUT HOW ABOUT THIS, THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE.\nIT'S NOT 4%. HOW ABOUT ALL THE NUMBER WHO\nHAVE LEFT THE WORK FORCE? HOW ABOUT THE PEOPLE IF LOUSY\nJOBS. THAT RATE IS ACTUALLY 40%, TRUMP\nSAYS HE'S HEARD. >> HE'S HEARD PEOPLE SAY IT'S\n40%. IT'S NOT 40%.\nHE'S ALSO SAID IT'S DEPRESSION ERA UNEMPLOYMENT.\nIT'S NOT. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS 4.9%.\nTHE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE MEASURES PEOPLE WHO HAVE A JOB OR ARE\nLOOKING FOR A JOB. WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT ARE ALL\nTHE PEOPLE WHO AREN'T LOOKING. THERE ARE A LOT OF REASONS,\nCHRIS, WHY PEOPLE AREN'T LOOKING.\n10,000 BABY BOOMERS A DAY HIT 65 YEARS OLD.\nSOME OF THEM ARE NOT LOOKING BECAUSE THEY'RE RETIRED.\nMY GRANDMA IS NOT LOOKING FOR A JOB BECAUSE HE'S 88.\nSOME PEOPLE ARE HOME TAKING CARE OF THEIR KIDS BECAUSE CHILDCARE\nCOSTS AS MUCH AS COLLEGE. SO THERE ARE A LOT OF POLICY\nDRIVEN THINGS WE CAN DO TO ADDRESS THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN\nLEFT BEHIND BY THE LABOR MARKET, BUT PRESIDENT UNEMPLOYMENT RATE\nIS NOT 40%. >> SO WHY DO YOU ECONOMIST TYPES\nGET IN HIGH DUJEN OVER THIS? THIS ISN'T JUST POLITICAL TALK.\nTHIS IS WHAT HE DOES ON A RANGE OF ISSUES.\nWHY DOES IT MATTER MORE WHEN HE DOES IT ABOUT THE ECONOMY?\n>> WELL, INTEREST RATES MATTER HUGELY.\nTHIS IS WHAT YOU PAY ON YOUR HOUSE, ON YOUR CAR.\nALSO, CONFIDENCE IN THE ECONOMY. WHEN HE COMES IN AND SAYS THE\nFED IS POLITICAL, THE FED IS MANIPULATING, THAT'S A\nCONFIDENCE ISSUE. THAT CAN REALLY SHAKE INVESTORS.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL THAT THERE'S A BUBBLE IN THE STOCK\nMARKET RIGHT NOW. THAT'S WORTH SAYING.\nLOW RATES HAVE DEFINITELY HELPED PUSH STOCKS UP.\nTHERE'S A DIVIDE BETWEEN WHAT PEOPLE ARE FEELING AND THE REAL\nECONOMY ON MAIN STREET AND STOCKS.\nTHAT'S A CONVERSATION THAT WE HAVE BEEN HAVING FOR SEVERAL\nYEARS NOW. THAT'S NOT ABOUT THE FED BEING\nPOLITICAL. >> NOW, MARK CUBAN, WE ALL KNOW\nWHO HE IS. HE TWEETED ABOUT THIS.\nHE SEES IT AS A BIG DEAL. TRUMP'S COMMENT ON THE FED IS\nEXACTLY WHY THE MARKET WILL TANK IF HE IS ELECTED.\nASK HIM IF HE UNDERSTANDS HOW THE FED WORKS.\nALL RIGHT. LET'S PUT THE SECOND PART ASIDE,\nHOW THE FED WORKS. THE FIRST PART, IS CUBAN GUILTY\nOF POLITICAL HYPERBOLE? IS THERE ANY REASON TO BELIEVE\nMARKETS WOULD TANK IF TRUMP CAME IN?\n>> WHEN YOU TALK TO PEOPLE IN THE MARKETS, IF DONALD TRUMP\nWERE ELECTED PRESIDENT, MARKET PARTICIPANTS THINK IF HE DID THE\nTHINGS HE SAYS HE WANTS TO DO, BUILD A WALL, HAVE A TRADE WAR\nWITH CHINA, THAT WOULD UNDERMINE CONFIDENCE IN AMERICAN\nCOMPANIES, UNDERMINE CONFIDENCE IN THE ECONOMY, AND HURT THE\nSTOCK MARKET. THAT IS THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM\nTHERE. THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP, THERE IS THIS CONVENTION, AND DONALD TRUMP\nDEFIES ALL CONVENTIONS. YOU DON'T TALK UP OR DOWN THE\nECONOMY, AND YOU DON'T ATTACK THE FED.\nTHE FED IS MANIPULATING INTEREST RATES.\nTHAT ITS JOB. IT'S BEEN DOING THAT IN THE\nABSENCE OF ANY KIND OF CONCRETE POLICY IN WASHINGTON TO GROW THE\nAMERICAN ECONOMY OVER THE PAST EIGHT YEARS.\n>> IT'S INTERESTING. RECENTLY IN MEETINGS, JANET\nYELLEN AND OTHER FED GOVERNORS HAVE BEEN KIND OF IN VEILED\nLANGUAGE SAYING, YOU KNOW WHAT, WASHINGTON, WE NEED SOME FISCAL\nSTIMULUS. WE NEED YOU TO DO SOME OF THE\nHEAVY LIFTING. WE HAVE BEEN DOING IT FOR SO\nLONG. >> SO HE SAID THEY'RE TRYING TO\nHELP THE DEMOCRATS. THAT'S THE LAST OF HIS\nALLEGATIONS. THEY'RE DOING EXACTLY WHAT YOU\nSAY, THAT CONGRESS ISN'T GIVING OBAMA WHAT HE WANTS, SO THEY\nWILL. JUICE THE SYSTEM TO MAKE IT LOOK\nGOOD WHEN IT ISN'T. >> THERE'S A VERY VIGOROUS\nDEBATE GOING ON IN THE FED RIGHT NOW.\nIT'S ABOUT HALF AND HALF ON WHETHER TO RAISE RATES OR NOT.\nIT'S NOT AS THOUGH EVERYBODY IN THE FED IS SAYING WE GOT TO KEEP\nRATES LOW TO HELP THE DEMOCRATS.

TRUMP FOUNDATION.\nTRUMP SAYS HE DONATES MILLIONS, BUT ACCORDING TO THE \"WASHINGTON\nPOST,\" HE HASN'T GIVEN ANY MONEY TO HIS OWN FOUNDATION SINCE\n2008. HE'S BEEN GIVING AWAY OTHER\nPEOPLE'S MONEY TO CHARITY, AND ACCORDING TO THE \"POST\" HE'S\nACTUALLY BENEFITING FROM THAT. \"OUTFRONT\" TONIGHT, DAVID HAS\nBEEN INVESTIGATING THE TRUMP FOUNDATION FOR THE \"POST\" FOR\nMONTHS AND MONTHS. A LOT OF ARTICLES AND STORIES ON\nTHIS, DAVID. TRUMP NOT DONATING TO HIS OWN\nFOUNDATION SINCE 2008. YOU ARE REPORTING, THOUGH, HE\nHAS BENEFITED PERSONALLY FROM THAT FOUNDATION.\nTELL US HOW. >> WELL, IN A COUPLE OF WAYS.\nONE IS THAT HE'S ACTUALLY USED MONEY FROM THE FOUNDATION, WHICH\nIS EARMARKED FOR CHARITABLE PURPOSES TO BUY THINGS FOR\nHIMSELF. HE ONCE BOUGHT, SPENT $12,000 OF\nTHE FOUNDATION'S MONEY TO BUY HIMSELF AN AUTOGRAPHED FOOTBALL\nHELMET AND SPENT $20,000 OF THE FOUNDATION' MONEY TO BUY A GIANT\nSIX-FOOT-TALL PORT RAIT OF HIMSELF.\nIN BOTH CASES SEEMS TO BE A VIOLATION OF THE IRS RULES.\nIN ADDITION, TRUMP USES OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY IN THE\nFOUNDATION, GIVES IT TO CHARITIES THAT DO BUSINESS AT\nHIS CLUBS IN FLORIDA. TRUMP CAN MAKE UP TO $265,000\nOFF ONE NIGHT, ONE CHARITY GALA AT MAR-A-LA FGO.\nUSES OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY TO CEMENT THOSE RELATIONSHIPS.\n>> WHEN YOU HAVE FOUNDATIONS, PEOPLE CAN GIVE TO FOUNDATIONS,\nRIGHT, THEN THOSE FOUNDATIONS GIVE MONEY AWAY SO THAT IN AND\nOF ITSELF HAPPENS IN PLENTY OF CASES, BUT WHEN YOU SAY HE'S NOT\nGIVING TO HIS OWN FOUNDATION, THE BAG QUIG QUESTION, OF COURS\nHE GIVING TO CHARITY, HIMSELF, IN HIS OWN NAME, NOT THROUGH HIS\nFOUNDATION? WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND THERE?\n>> SO FAR I CALLED 326 CHARITIES CLOSELY TIED TO DONALD TRUMP\nLOOKING FOR EVIDENCE THEY HAD GOTTEN MONEY FROM TRUMP.\nTO TRY TO FIND SOME SIGN THAT THEY'RE OUT THERE.\nBETWEEN 2008 AND THIS MAY, I FOUND JUST ONE DONATION OUT OF\nTRUMP'S OWN POCKET. THAT WAS IN 2009 AND IT WAS FOR\nLESS THAN $10,000.  OBVIOUSLY THERE COULD BE OTHER\nLARGE DONATIONS YOU DID NOT FIND, BUT YOU FOUND WHATEVER\nCHARITIES THAT HAD LINKS TO TRUMP, HIMSELF, THAT YOU WOULD\nHAVE THOUGHT THOSE WOULD BE ONES HE GAVE TO?\n>> THAT'S RIGHT. FIRST OF ALL, I ASKED THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN A NUMBER OF TIMES, HEY, THERE'S A LIST OF ORGANIZATIONS\nHE'S GIVEN MONEY TO, GIVE IT TO ME.\nTHEY HAVEN'T. I LOOKED AT GROUPS HE'D GIVEN\nMONEY TO FROM THE TRUMP FOUNDATION, OTHER PEOPLE'S\nMONEY. GROUPS HE PRAISED IN PUBLIC,\nGROUPS WHERE HE'D GONE TO THEIR GALAS, ANYBODY WHO HAD A\nCONNECTION TO TRUMP LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE.\n>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

IT'S CONFUSING BECAUSE WE'RE\nTALKING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S PERSONAL DONATIONS WHICH ARE\nSOMEWHERE BURIED IN HIS HIDDEN TAX RECORDS AND HIS DONALD J.\nTRUMP FOUNDATION WHICH IS VERY PUBLIC.\nYOU HAVE TO FILE THESE 990 REPORTS WITH THE IRS TO KEEP THE\nSTATUS. THAT'S WHERE WE GET THESE\nRECORDS FROM, THE FOUNDATION. WE LEARNED HE HASN'T GIVEN ANY\nMONEY TO HIS OWN FOUNDATION, THE ONE THAT BEARS HIS NAPME, SINCE\n2008. BEFORE THAT, HE DID GIVE A\nSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT. SO WHERE DOES THE REST OF THE\nMONEY COME FROM? WELL, IT'S NOT A LOT.\nTHIS FOUNDATION IS PRETTY SMART.

COMEDY CENTRAL DONATED $400,000.\nWORLD WRESTLING ENTERTAINMENT GAVE HIS FOUNDATION $1 MILLION.\nALL ENTITIES HE WAS HAVING BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH.\n>> NONE OF HIS OWN MONEY TO HIS OWN FOUNDATION IN 2008.\nTHAT IS SOME INFORMATION THERE. WHAT ABOUT WHERE HIS FOUNDATION\nIS GOING? >> IT'S VERY BROAD.\nTHE FOUNDATION DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE A CENTRAL CAUSE.\nHE'S GIVEN MONEY TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION FOR INSTANCE.\nIT'S BEEN WIDELY REPORTED. $100,000 TO CITIZENS UNITED\nFOUNDATION, THE CONSERVATIVE POLITICAL GROUP, WHOSE PRESIDENT\nHAS JUST JOINED TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN.\nFOR TWO YEARS, HE GAVE TO THE PALM BEACH POLICE FOUNDATION.\nTHE GROUP HOLDS ITS POLICEMEN BALLS AT TRUMP RESORT EVERY\nWINTER. GET THIS, TRUMP'S MOR ALARGO\nRESORT CHARGES. IT'S LIKE $500,000 OVER TWO\nDIFFERENT BALLS. SO ON THE ONE HAND HE'S GIVING\nTO THIS GROUP. ON THE OTHER HAND, HE'S CHARGING\nTHEM FOR USE OF THE BALLROOM. >> PUT IT INTO PERSPECTIVE, THE\nFOUNDATION BROADLY. HOW DOES THE TRUMP CHARITY, HOW\nDOES THE FOUNDATION COMPARE TO OTHER CHARITIES?\n>> LET'S COMPARE IT TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nTHE CLINTON FOUNDATION IS HUGE. IN 2014, HAD $1.3 MILLION IN THE\nBANK. THEY DON'T DO A LOT.\nTHERE'S NOT A LOT OF ACTIVITY. TRUMP FOUNDATION HIRES A LOT OF\nPEOPLE. THEY HAVE PROJECTS.\nTHE TRUMP FOUNDATION DOESN'T HAVE A SINGLE EMPLOYEE.\nTHEY'RE VERY, VERY SMALL. COMPARED TO THE ACTUAL CLINTON\nFOUNDATION. NOW, THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN DID GET\nBACK TO US LAST NIGHT SAYING ALL THE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE\nFOUNDATION ARE INACCURATE.

IN ADDITION, FRIENDS PLAINTIFF\nTRUMP HAVE GENEROUSLY DONATED TO HIS FOUNDATION.\nTHE STATEMENT POINTS OUT TRUMP DOESN'T RECEIVE COMPENSATION AND\nHE MAKES REGULAR PERSONAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO CHARITIES AND\nCAUSES OF HIS CHOOSING OUTSIDE THE FOUNDATION IT HERE'S THE\nPROBLEM, WE CAN'T FIND ANY RECORDS OF IT.\nWE JUST DON'T TAKE HIS WORD FOR IT.\nWE CAN'T AT THIS POINT IN HIS PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.\nWE'RE NOT SEEING SIGNS OF IT. >> NOrd RO RECORDS OF IT AND NO\nRETURNS TO CHECK IT.

I WANT TO START WITH YOU BECAUSE\nON THIS ISSUE OF CHARITY, TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER WAS\nASKED THIS MORNING ON CNN WILL TRUMP RELEASE EXACTLY HOW MUCH\nHE HIMSELF HAS GIVEN TO CHARITY AND KELLYANNE CONWAY'S RESPONSE\nWAS I DOUBT IT. I'M NOT SURE THAT'S TRANSPARE\nTRANSPARENCY. >> IT'S DEFINITELY NOT\nTRANSPARENCY. I HAVE TO ASK, LIKE, HOW IS THIS\nAN ACCEPTABLE ANSWER? WHY IS HE ALLOWED TO GO OUT AND\nTALK ABOUT HOW CHARITABLE HE IS? BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY\nOBLIGATION TO PROVE WHAT HE'S SAYING.\nHE NEEDS TO RELEASE THIS INFORMATION.\nWE NEED TO SEE WHAT HIS CHARITABLE GIVING HAS BEEN OVER\nTHE YEARS BECAUSE HE'S MADE A LOT OF CLAIMS ABOUT IT AND\nPEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW, TO HAVE SOME SORT OF VERIFICATION\nTHIS HAS HAPPENED. >> WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE KIND\nOF THE UMBRELLA THEME OF TRANSPARENCY HERE, NIA, THIS IS\nEXACTLY WHAT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN POINTS TO AS A DOUBLE\nSTANDARD. >> THAT'S RIGHT.\nTHEY'RE POINTING TO THE DOUBLE STANDARD.\nNOT ONLY LOOKING AT THE PRESS SAYING THE PRESS HASN'T COVERED\nTHIS WELL, BUT ALSO THAT DONALD TRUMP GETS AWAY WITH SAYING\nTHINGS THAT ARE EITHER NOT PROVABLE OR NOT ACCURATE AND\nDOESN'T REALLY PAY A PRICE FOR THEM.\nIT LOOKS LIKE HE IS ABLE TO DO THAT.\nIT HASN'T DAMAGED HIM IN THE POLLS.\nIF YOU TALK ABOUT THE TAX RETURNS AND HIM NOT RELEASING\nTHOSE, AT THIS POINT, IT'S HARD TO SEE IF HE HAS ANY INCENTIVE\nIN DOING THOSE. WE KNOW HILLARY CLINTON HAS\nGIVEN TO CHARITY BECAUSE SHE'S RELEASED HER TAX RETURNS.\nTHEY'VE GIVEN ABOUT 10% OF THEIR INCOME TO CHARITY, AND WE DON'T\nKNOW THAT FROM DONALD TRUMP ABOUT HIS CHARITIES.\nWE WOULD KNOW FROM THE TAX RETURNS.\nTHAT'S SOMETHING HAE HASN'T BEEN WILLING TO DO.\nIT CERTAINLY I THINK TAKINGS IT AWAY FROM THE SHARPNESS, THE\nEFFECTIVENESS OF HIS ARGUMENT. HE CAN'T CONTINUE TO EFFECTIVELY\nTAG HILLARY CLINTON. HE FOR INSTANCE, HILLARY'S\nHIDING MEME THAT THEY KEPT BLASTING OUT TO SUPPORTERS AND\nE-MAILS. HE HIMSELF HASN'T BEEN\nTRANSPARENT IN ANY NUMBER OF THINGS.\n>> THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN SAYS HE'S UNDER AUDIT WHICH IS WHY HE\nCAN'T RELEASE HIS TAXES.

WE TALKED TO OVER 200 GROUPS\nTHAT EITHER GAVE OR GOT MONEY FROM THE TRUMP FOUNDATION.\n>> SO LET ME SEE IF I HAVE THIS RIGHT.\nTHE SUGGESTION WOULD BE IT SAYS THAT DONALD J. TRUMP FOUNDATION,\nBUT IT'S NOT HIS MONEY. USUALLY YOUR NAME IS ON THE\nFOUNDATION, IT'S YOUR MONEY. IF YOU'RE DEAD, IT WAS YOUR\nMONEY BEFORE YOU DIED. HERE YOU'RE SAYING YOU FOUND\nTHROUGH REPORTING THAT THE MONEY THAT THE FOUNDATION GIVES IS NOT\nNECESSARILY TRUMP'S MONEY. AND, IN FACT, HE HAS NOT PUT ANY\nMONEY INTO THE FOUNDATION SINCE WHEN?\n>> SINCE 2008. THAT'S IN TAX RECORDS.\nHE HASN'T GIVEN ANY MONEY TO HIS OWN FOUNDATION SINCE 2008.\nINSTEAD HE'S BEEN GIVING AWAY OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY SINCE THEN.\nAS YOU SAID, THE EXPECTATION IS IF YOU HAVE YOUR NAME ON A\nFOUNDATION, IT'S YOUR MONEY. THAT'S THE WAY MOST OTHER PEOPLE\nDO IT. I THOUGHT OF OTHER TAX EXPERTS\nWHO SAID THEY COULDN'T THINK OF SOMEBODY WHO KEPT THEIR NAME ON\nIT, STOPPED GIVING MONEY AND GAVE OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY AWAY\nWITH THEIR NAME ON IT. >> TRUMP HAS GIVEN MILLIONS, THE\nFOUNDATION HAS GIVEN $102 MILLION OVER THE LAST FIVE\nYEARS. THIS IS A GOOD THING.\nWHAT'S YOUR RESPONSE? >> WELL, THERE IS SORT OF\nPLAYING SOME GAMES WITH THE WORDS HERE.\nSO IT WAS A LIST THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN PUT OUT THAT SAID IT\nWAS $102 MILLION OF DONALD TRUMP'S CHARITABLE DONATIONS.\nWE DUG INTO THAT. THIS WAS A STORY THAT HAPPENED A\nCOUPLE OF MONTHS AGO. IT TURNS OUT THAT LIST OF $102\nMILLION CONTAINED NOT ONE DOLLAR OUT OF DONALD TRUMP'S OWN\nPOCKET. INSTEAD, MOST OF THE GIFTS WERE\nGIFTS OF FREE ROUNDS OF GOLF GIVEN AWAY BY TRUMP'S GOLF\nCOURSES TO LOCAL CHARITIES, WHICH IS CHARITY BUT NOT MONEY\nOUT OF DONALD TRUMP'S POCKET WHICH IS SORT OF WHAT THEY\nIMPLIED IT WAS. WE'VE ASKED THEM FOR OTHER\nEVIDENCE. ANYTHING ELSE?\nANYTHING THAT WOULD PROVE DONALD TRUMP GIVES MONEY OUT OF HIS\nPOCKET TO CHARITY AND WE'VE HEARD NOTHING.\n>> YOU GUYS WERE EARLY ON THE STORY THAT THE FOUNDATION GOT\nCAUGHT BY THE IRS BY MAKING A POLITICAL DONATION WHICH THIS\nTYPE OF FOUNDATION IS NOT ALLOWED TO DO.\nWHAT ELSE DID YOU FIND IN THERE THAT APPROACHES, LET ALONE\nCROSSES, A LEGAL LINE? >> WELL, THERE'S A COUPLE OF\nTHINGS. ONE IS THERE ARE A NUMBER OF\nINCORRECT LISTINGS IN ITS TAX FILINGS.\nIT DESCRIBED GIFTS THAT DON'T APPEAR TO EXIST.\nONE RELATES TO THAT ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION.\nWHEN TRUMP'S FOUNDATION FILED ITS TAXES WITH THE IRS, IT\nDIDN'T LIST THE ILLEGAL CONTRIBUTION AS IT WAS SUPPOSED\nTO. INSTEAD LISTED A NONEXISTENT\nDONATION TO ANOTHER GROUP. BASICALLY THEY ADDED A FAKE\nDONATION, THEY SAY INADVERTENTLY.\nIT SERVED THE PURPOSE OR SERVED THE EFFECT OF COVERING UP THE\nILLEGAL CONTRIBUTION IN THEIR IRS FILINGS.\nTHERE'S ANOTHER THING WHICH YOU GUYS REFERRED TO EARLIER.\nIRS PROHIBIT NONPROFIT MANAGERS FROM USING THE CHARITY'S MONEY\nFOR BUYING THINGS FOR THEMSELVES.\nTRUMP HAS DONE THAT TWICE. HE BOUGHT A $12,000 FOOTBALL\nHELMET AND HE BOUGHT A 6 FOOT PORTRAIT OF HIMSELF.\n>> HE BOUGHT A PORTRAIT OF HIMSELF THAT WAS BEING SOLD FOR\nCHARITY AND TRUMP BOUGHT IT. NOW THE PUSHBACK ON THAT IS,\nYEAH, BUT IT WAS MONEY THAT WAS GOING TO THE KOMEN FOUNDATION\nFOR BREAST CANCER. ISN'T THAT A GOOD THING?\nWHY DO YOU THINK THIS MATTERS? >> IT MATTERS TO THE IRS.\nIT CERTAINLY WAS MONEY IN BOTH CASES, THESE WERE AUCTIONS HELD\nBY A CHARITY. THE CHECK WAS WRITTEN TO A\nCHARITY. THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.\nTHE IRS SAYS IF YOU WANT TO DO THAT, YOU WANT TO BUY AN AUCTION\nTO A CHARITY FOR YOURSELF, YOU GIVE IT OUT OF YOUR OWN POCKET\nIF THE ITEM IS GOING TO GO TO YOU.\nIF YOU BUY SOMETHING WITH THE CHARITY'S MONEY, THE THING THAT\nYOU BUY HAS TO HAVE A CHARITABLE PURPOSE.\nIT HAS TO GO TO A CHARITY, HELP A CHARITY.\nYOU CAN'T SAY THE MONEY WENT TO THE CHARITY IN THE END.\nIT'S INCIDENTAL I GOT THE HELMET OR THE PAINTING.\nIF YOU GOT THE THING, YOU NEED TO COME FORWARD.\nI GAVE THIS TIM TEBOW FOOTBALL HELMET TO ANOTHER CHARITY, I\nGAVE THIS PORTRAIT TO ANOTHER CHARITY.\nHE HASN'T DONE THIS. >> WHEN PEOPLE READ THIS STORY,\nI HOPE THEY DO, THIS VETTING MATTERS THERE, WILL BE A\nQUESTION OF, WELL, THE SO WHAT FACTOR.\nHOW DOES THIS SIZE UP TO WHAT WE WERE HEARING ABOUT THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION AND WHAT WERE ALLEGATIONS OF PAY FOR PLAY IN\nTHE HIGHEST LEVELS WITH FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, PEOPLE WHO COULD BE\nBAD ACTORS. DO YOU SEE A FALSE EQUIVALENCE\nBEING APPLIED HERE IN THE CAMPAIGN?\n>> WELL, THE DISTINCTION HERE, THE TRUMP FOUNDATION AND CLINTON\nFOUNDATION ARE REALLY DIFFERENT ANIMALS.\nTHE CLINTON FOUNDATION IS REALLY BIG, 2,000 EMPLOYEES, WORK ALL\nOVER THE WORLD. THE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT HILLARY\nCLINTON DID THERE ARE VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE ONES TRUMP\nARE FACING. IN HER CASE YOU SAID IT'S ABOUT\nDID SHE GIVE SPECIAL ACCESS OR SPECIAL FAVORS TO PEOPLE WHO\nDONATED TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nTHE TRUMP FOUNDATION IS NOT WHETHER HE DID ANYTHING WRONG AS\nA GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, OBVIOUSLY HE'S NOT.\nIT'S ABOUT HIS OWN PERSONAL APPROACH TO CHARITY AND HIS OWN\nWHAT SORT OF MORAL RESPONSIBILITY DOES HE FEEL TO\nHELPING THE WORLD. HE'S OBVIOUSLY A VERY RICH MAN,\nAT LEAST HE SAYS HE'S A VERY RICH MAN.\nTO USE THAT MONEY FOR GOOD. FEEL WHAT WE HAVE FOUND IS HE DOESN'T\nSEEM TO HAVE SPENT HIS OWN MONEY TO CHARITY AND IN FACT WENT TO\nGREAT LENGTHS TO GET OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY THAT HE COULD\nGIVE AWAY SO HE COULD APPEAR OF BEING CHARITABLE WITHOUT HAVING\nTHE SACRIFICE OF GIVING ANYTHING HIMSELF.\n>> THANK YOU FOR JOINING US ON \"NEW DAY.\"\n>> THANK YOU.",

HILLARY CLINTON ALSO CALLED INTO\nCNN LAST NIGHT TO DESCRIBE THESE PAST HEALTH SCARES.\nHERE'S A LISTEN. >> RARELY, BUT ON MANY\nOCCASIONS, OVER THE LAST MANY, MANY YEARS, SHE'S GOTTEN\nSEVERELY DEHYDRATED. >> HOW OFTEN HAS THIS HAPPENED?\n>> I THINK REALLY ONLY TWICE THAT I CAN RECALL.\nYOU KNOW, IT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS OCCURRED A FEW TIMES OVER\nTHE COURSE OF MY LIFE. I'M AWARE OF IT.\nUSUALLY CAN AVOID IT. >> LET'S BRING BACK OUR PANEL.\nRON BROWNSTEIN, JACKIE KUCINICH. RON, HER HEALTH IS ONLY A\nCURSORY ASPECT, A SURFACE ASPECT OF WHAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING\nABOUT HEAR. THIS IS TRANSPARENCY.\nTHIS IS WHAT THIS CAMPAIGN DECIDES TO SAY AND UNDER WHAT\nPRESSURE, AND SIMILARLY WHAT TRUMP IGNORES AND THROWS BACK ON\nTHE MEDIA AS AN UNREASONABLE REQUEST.\nISN'T THAT FAIR? >> THAT'S PARADOX OF THIS\nCAMPAIGN. IF WE COULD MEASURE THE WORDS\nWRITTEN ABOUT THIS CAMPAIGN, PROBABLY LIKE 10,000 TO 1.\nYET, WE DON'T HAVE SO MUCH OF THE BASIC INFORMATION WE'VE HAD\nON PREVIOUS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES.\nI AGREE. YOU CAN LOOK AT THIS EPISODE AS\nA MICROCOSM OF THE WAY CLINTON OFTEN DEALS WITH DIFFICULT\nCHOICES. THE FIRST INSTINCT IS TO HOLD\nINFORMATION TIGHTLY AROUND A NARROW CIRCLE OF ADVISERS, EVEN\nWITHIN THE CAMPAIGN, AND ONLY DISCLOSE WHAT THEY HAVE TO\nDISCLOSE. WHETHER THAT WOULD WORK -- YOU\nWOULD HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE QUESTION OF NOT ONLY WHAT IT\nMEANS FOR THE CAMPAIGN BUT WHAT IT MEANS FOR GOVERNING.\nSIMILARLY WITH TRUMP AND THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY AND\nDISCLOSURE FROM HIM, IF EITHER OF THEM WIN, WOULD THESE BE THE\nATTITUDES THEY CARRY INTO THE PRESIDENCY.\n>> SO IS BILL CLINTON THE ANTIDOTE TO THAT?\nHE'S SAID SHE'S BEEN SEVERELY DEHYDRATED BEFORE.\n>> IT'S A LITTLE STRANGE. IN THE 1990s, WE KNEW A LOT\nABOUT BILL CLINTON'S HEALTH BACK THEN.\nHE WAS A GUY YOU COULD ASK QUESTIONS AND HE WOULD OVERSHARE\nAND SOMETIMES BE A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH.\nBUT HE WAS IN HIS MID-40s, I THINK, WHEN HE WAS PUTTING ALL\nTHIS INFORMATION OUT. HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN WORKING\nSUCH A GRUELING SCHEDULE, SUCH A HARD WORKER IN TERMS OF HER\nCAMPAIGN SCHEDULE. THE DECISION AT LEAST RIGHT NOW\nNOT TO PUT OUT MORE INFORMATION THAN YOU NEED TO, YOU KNOW, TO\nSORT OF CUT THAT BARE MINIMUM, I JUST THINK IT SORT OF REINFORCES\nOR PLAYS INTO THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT, OKAY, HOW STRAIGHT\nFORWARD ARE YOU, HOW HONEST ARE YOU, ESPECIALLY IF WE HAVE THESE\nQUESTIONS. >> AND THEY'RE RIGHT IN THAT\nDONALD TRUMP SHOULD RELEASE MORE OF HIS MEDICAL RECORDS.\n>> HE SAYS HE'S GOING TO THIS WEEK.\n>> NOT HIS TAXES. HIS MEDICAL RECORDS.\n>> THIS WEEK BOTH CAMPAIGNS SAY WE'RE GOING TO GET MORE\nINFORMATION. >> BUT HE HAD A CHANCE TO DO IT\nAND HE BLEW IT WITH THAT SILLY DOCTOR LETTER THAT WAS, YOU\nKNOW, BASICALLY A SLAP IN THE FACE OF THE REQUEST OF\nINFORMATION. THAT'S WHAT IT WAS.\nYEAH, I'LL GIVE YO A DOCTOR'S LETTER THAT DIDN'T MEET\nANYBODY'S CRITERIA. >> THAT HE WROTE IN FIVE\nMINUTES, WE FOUND OUT LATER. >> UNDER PRESSURE.\n>> WE KNOW IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR US.\nYOU CAN ONLY ASK FOR THE TAXES SO MANY TIMES UNTIL VOTERS\nDECIDE, OH, YEAH, THIS DOES MATTER TO ME.\nWE WANT TO KNOW. THAT'S WHAT THEY RESPOND TO.\n>> UNTIL YOU FAINT IN PUBLIC. HILLARY CLINTON PROBABLY\nWOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO RELEASE ANY MORE MEDICAL RECORDS.\nSHE COULD HAVE BEEN SAYING LOOK AT DONALD TRUMP AND USING THAT\nAS HER DEFENSE. BECAUSE SHE FAINTED OR FELL OR\nWHATEVER HAPPENED THERE. >> OKAY.\nSPEAKING OF TRANSPARENCY, OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE LOTS OF\nQUESTIONS ABOUT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION AND HOW IT DOES\nBUSINESS. HILLARY CLINTON WAS ASKED ABOUT\nTHIS AND PARTICULARLY THE ACCUSATIONS OF THE PAY FOR\nACCESS. LISTEN TO HIS RESPONSE.\n>> IF YOU THINK ABOUT NOBODY SHOULD EVER CALL SOMEBODY THEY\nKNOW AND SAY, WELL, SO AND SO WOULD LIKE A MEETING, THAT FITS\nTHE WAY THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT WORKS.\nI CAN SAY THAT TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE, I KNOW FOR A FACT\nONLY FROM THE PEOPLE I READ IN THE PAPER THAT THE PEOPLE THEY\nACCUSED OR IMPLIED GAVE MONEY TO THE FOUNDATION JUST SO THEY\nCOULD HAVE SOME IN WITH HILLARY DID NOT DO THAT.\nTHAT WAS SIMPLY NOT TRUE. >> WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT\nRESPONSE? >> AFTER ALL WE'VE TALKED ABOUT\nTHIS COVERAGE, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE VOTER TURNOUT COULD BE LOWER\nTHAN IN 2012. PART OF THE REASON IS EACH OF\nTHEM HAVE HAD SO MANY FLAWS EXPOSED.\nI DON'T THINK THAT'S A SATISFACTORY ANSWER ON THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO THE STATE\nDEPARTMENT WHILE HILLARY CLINTON WAS SECRETARY OF STATE.\nON THE OTHER HAND, AS \"THE WASHINGTON POST\" HAS BEEN\nREPORTING, THE PROBLEMS WITH THE TRUMP FOUNDATION ARE ENORMOUS,\nINCLUDING A GIFT TO A STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN FLORIDA AT A\nTIME WHEN SHE WAS INVESTIGATING TRUMP UNIVERSITY.\nIT'S HARD TO IMAGINE MORE PAY FOR PLAY ACCUSATION THAN THAT.\nAND THEY PAID A PENALTY. YOU HAVE TWO CANDIDATES ABOUT\nWHOM MANY VOTERS HAVE DOUBTS. AND THAT IS -- I THINK IT'S\nLIKELY ON ELECTION DAY THAT A M\nMAJORITY OF VOTERS ALREADY SAY THEY HAVE AN UNFAVORABLE OPINION\nOF EACH CANDIDATE. >> IT ALSO WINDS UP BEING A\nTACTICAL DECISION. DOES TRUMP GAIN ADVANTAGE BY\nGOING AFTER HILLARY CLINTON FOR USING THE WORD DEPLORABLE AND\nOVERREACHING IN AN INSULTING WAY, WHICH IS LIKE A SIGNATURE\nISSUE OF HIM. SIMILARLY ON THE FOUNDATION,\nLET'S LISTEN TO MIKE PENCE, OBVIOUSLY TRUMP'S RUNNING MATE,\nDEFENDING THE TRUMP FOUNDATION FROM THESE \"WASHINGTON POST\"\nALLEGATIONS. >> ANYONE WHO KNOWS ABOUT DONALD\nTRUMP AND HIS CAREER KNOWS THAT THIS IS A MAN WHO'S GIVEN AWAY\nTENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO CHARITABLE CAUSES.\nTHERE SIMPLY IS NO QUESTION. YOU CAN TALK TO CHARITIES ALL\nACROSS THE COUNTRY WHO HAVE BENEFITTED BY THE GENEROSITY OF\nTHE TRUMP FAMILY. I'M VERY, VERY PROUD OF THEIR\nCHARITABLE RECORD. >> HERE'S THE PROBLEM.\nAT A MINIMUM, ACCORDING TO WHAT WE KNOW, THAT IS A GROSS\nEXAGGERATION. WE DON'T KNOW TENS OF MILLIONS.\nSO NOW YOU GET INTO, WELL, IS THIS JUST A RELATIVE ASSESSMENT,\nOR DO YOU THINK \"THE WASHINGTON POST\" IS ANGLING TO BLOW UP THIS\nFOUNDATION ALTOGETHER AND SAY HE ACTUALLY DOESN'T GIVE MONEY,\nIT'S EVEN ELSE'S MONEY THAT COMES IN UNDER A FOUNDATION WITH\nHIS NAME ON IT. >> THIS IS REALLY A STRETCH.\nDONALD TRUMP GAVE ABOUT $2 MILLION OR SO IN THE 2 0 --\n2000s TO HIS FOUNDATION. HE'S USED OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY\nAND STEERED IT TO CHARITIES, WHICH YOU WOULD THINK WOULD OPEN\nUP HUGE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT DONALD TRUMP WAS SORT OF EITHER\nDOING FOR THAT MONEY OR WHAT HE MAY OWE TO THOSE PEOPLE OR\nWHETHER HE HAS ANY KIND OF MORAL CLAIM, WHICH IS A PART OF WHAT\nF PHILANTHROPY IS SUPPOSED TO BE.\nI MADE A COMMITMENT TO THESE CHARITIES, I WANTED TO TRY TO\nSORT OF DO GOOD WORK, AND THE CLINTON FOUNDATION HAS DONE\nINCREDIBLE WORK OVERSEAS WITH FIGHTING A.I.D.S.\n>> IS THAT THE CLINTONS' OWN MONEY?\n>> NO, IT'S NOT. >> THEY DO HAVE A FAMILY\nFOUNDATION. >> BUT THEY'VE ALSO NEVER\nCLAIMED THAT THEY PERSONALLY GIVE AWAY A LOT OF MONEY.\nI'VE MET A LOT OF PEOPLE IN AND AROUND NEW YORK, POWER BROKERS,\nWHO SAY TRUMP GIVES THEM MONEY. THE POINT IS THIS.\nHE DOESN'T RELEASE HIS TAXES, HE DOESN'T RELEASE THE INFORMATION\nTHAT WOULD VALIDATE HIS OWN CLAIMS.\nTHIS IS ON HIM. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT MIKE PENCE\nREFUSING TO CALL DAVID DUKE A DEPLORABLE.\nARE WE JUST MINCING WORDS, OR IS THIS A BIG DEAL?\nHE SAID, I'M NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF NAME CALLING.\nHE SAYS, WE'VE DISAVOWED HIM, WE DON'T LIKE DAVID DUKE, BUT I'M\nNOT GOING TO CALL HIM AN INSULT. >> IT SEEMS LIKE THEY WANT HIK\nTO OWN THE WORD DEPLORABLE. BUT THIS LOOKS BAD.\nOF COURSE DAVID DUKE IS DEPLORABLE.\nHE USED TO BE THE GRAND WIZARD OF THE KKK.\nTHEY WANT THAT WORD TO BE ONLY ASSOCIATED WITH HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHEY DON'T WANT TOP OWN IT. >> I THINK MIKE PENCE IS UNDER\nNO OBLIGATION TO USE THAT WORD. I THINK HE'S GETTING TOO MUCH OF\nA BAD RAP FOR HIS RESPONSE. THEY SAID THEY REPUDIATED HIM.\nMY DON'T THINK HE HAS TO USE THE HILLARY CLINTON WORD TO PROVE HE\nDOESN'T LIKE DAVID DUKE. >> PANEL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nGREAT TO HAVE ALL OF YOU HERE.",

THE CLINTONS FOUNDATION HAS\nACTED TO ADVANCE THE INTEREST OF FOREIGN NATIONALS, INCLUDING\nSAUDI ARABIA, BAHRAIN, PLACES THAT REALLY, YOU KNOW, SUPPRESS\nPEOPLE OF LGBT RIGHTS AND WOMEN'S RIGHTS --\n>> SORRY, SORRY, THEY HAVE TAKEN MONEY FROM THEM.\n>> YES. >> YOU SAY THEY WORKED TO\nADVANCE THE INTEREST OF THEM.

WITH RESPECT TO WHAT TRUMP HAS\nDONE. LOOK, THINK THE FACE SAID THAT\nHAS BEEN ERECTED AROUND HIS BUSINESS DEALINGS IS BECOMING\nMORE POROUS EITHER DAY. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS HERE\nIS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO ENGAGES IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE PAY TO PLAY,\nNUMBER ONE. AND NUMBER TWO, WITH RESPECT TO\nTHE FOUNDATION, IT'S NOTHING OF HIS OWN MONEY, EXCEPT PERHAPS\nONE SPECIFIC FOUNDATION. ALL HE'S DOING IS MOVING MONEY\nFROM ONE INDIVIDUAL GROUP TO ANOTHER THROUGH HIS\nORGANIZATION. COMING ACROSS AS HE'S A\nCHARITABLE INDIVIDUAL. WE BELIEVE NOW THAT'S NOT THE\nCASE. WE DON'T REALLY KNOW FOR SURE --\n>> THIS IS AN OUTRAGEOUS STATEMENT --\n>> HOLD ON, ISN'T THAT KIND OF WHAT'S HANGING OVER, NO MATTER\nHOW STRONG THE ORGANIZATION, THE CLINTON FOUNDATION HAS\nAPPEARANCE OF PROBLEMS, IS THAT NO ONE KNOWS, BECAUSE DONALD\nTRUMP WON'T RELEASE RECORDS TO PROVE ANYTHING ONE WAY OR\nANOTHER. WITH REGARD TO HIS CHARITABLE\nGIVINGS. >> THERE ARE FIVE DISBURSEMENTS\nIN QUESTION. TOTALING $51,000.\nYOU CONTRAST THAT WITH THE QUESTIONS ON PAY TO PLAY WITH\nTHE CLINTON FOUNDATION.

BEFORE I PLAYED A GAME IN THE\nNATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE AND I WOULD HEAR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM,\nI GOT THE CHILLS. >> BRINGS TEARS TO YOUR EYES,\nRIGHT? >> IT DOES.\nI'M AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN FROM TEXAS, I HAD TO FACE SKIN HEADS\nAND RACISM ALL MY LIFE SO I UNDERSTAND WHAT COLIN KAEPERNICK\nIS TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE I GET JUST AS MAD AS HE IS WHEN I HEAR\nABOUT AN UNARMED BLACK MAN GETTING KILLED BY A POLICE\nOFFICER. IT UPSETS ME, TOO.\nBUT STATEMENT IT IS ABOUT YOUR MESSAGING AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE\nCREDIBILITY. WE DON'T NEED TO HAVE THE LINES,\nYOU DON'T HAVE TO PICK SIDES IN THIS COUNTRY.\n>> YOU SAID THAT HE LOST YOU WITH -- WE TALKED ABOUT THIS,\nWHEN HE TALKED ABOUT THE POLICE OFFICER BECAUSE YOU LOSE\nCREDIBILITY WITH THAT. >> NO QUESTION.\n>> NO SOCIAL JUSTICE MOVEMENT IS PERFECT AND SO, YOU KNOW, I'M\nSURE THAT MAYBE HE WOULD CHANGE, HOPEFULLY, THAT PART OF THE\nPROTEST. HEY, CHRISTINE, THIS IS FROM\nMARC CUBAN. HE SAYS -- MARK CUBAN SAID, HE\nDIDN'T THROW A BOMB, FIRE A SHOT, START A RIOT, THROW A\nPUNCH, SHUT A BUSINESS, YELL AT SOMEONE, TROLL ANYONE.\nHE JUST SAT THERE QUIETLY. I MAY NOT UNDERSTAND ORAA GREEN\nWITH HIM, BUT HE SOUGHT US WE CAN DISAGREE IN THIS COUNTRY\nPEACEFULLY. I KNOW I WILL GET, YOU KNOW\nWHAT, FOR ANYTHING THAT SUGGESTS SUPPORT FOR COLIN KAEPERNICK,\nWHICH MAKES MY POINT EVEN MORE. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT,\nCHRISTINE? >> INTERESTING WHERE THE SUPPORT\nIS COMING FROM. I AM SURE THERE ARE MANY OTHER\nPLACES OTHER THAN MARK CUBAN'S OFFICE WHERE PEOPLE ARE SAYING,\nWAIT, YOU KNOW WHAT, LET ME THINK ABOUT THIS.\nI HAVE BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG ON THIS THAT WHETHER YOU AGREE OR\nDISAGREE WITH THE ACTUAL ACT, AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE OF NOT\nSTANDING AT ATTENTION. I WAS JUST AT THE OLYMPICS IN\nRIO, FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE THERE.\nREMEMBER ALL OF THE FURROR NOT PUTTING HER HAND OVER HER HEART?\nSHE WAS STANDING AT ATTENTION. THOSE PEOPLE ON SOCIAL MEDIA,\nHOW RIDICULOUS IS THAT THAT THEY WERE CRITICIZING GABBY DOUGLAS?\nTHE POINT IS ALL OF THIS GETS PEOPLE'S ATTENTION.\nWE ARE PASSIONATE, PEOPLE CARE. WHETHER YOU AGREE OR DISAGREE\nWITH WHAT SOME OF THE FOOTBALL PLAYERS ARE DOING, AND RIGHT NOW\nIT IS A SMALL PERCENTAGE BUT I THINK AS WE AGREE WE WILL SEE\nMORE IN OTHER SPORTS AS WELL. AGAIN, IT IS ONE OF THE FABULOUS\nTHINGS ABOUT OUR NATION, THAT OF COURSE WE DEFEND THE RIGHT FOR\nCOLIN KAEPERNICK AND OTHERS TO DO THIS.\nAND THAT'S JUST -- IT JUST SPEAKS VOLUMES ABOUT EVERYTHING\nTHAT THE UNITED STATES IS, AND HOPEFULLY WILL REMAIN.\nI THINK THAT TO ME IS A VERY SIMPLE WAY TO LOOK AT IT.\n>> YOU KNOW WHAT I JUST SAID AS COMING FROM MARK CUBAN WHO IS A\nTEAM OWNER WHO FEELS THAT WAY ABOUT IT.\nLISTEN, I THINK FROM THIS POINT OF DISCUSSING THE INITIAL SHOCK\nOR SURPRISE OF IT, THAT ASPECT, WE WILL START TO DISCUSS THE\nISSUES THEY DEEM ARE IMPORTANT, THAT COLIN KAEPERNICK AND OTHERS\nARE FIGHTING FOR, KAEPERNICK AND OTHERS ARE FIGHTING FOR.\nTHANK YOU. GREAT CONVERSATION.\nWE WILL BE RIGHT BACK. .\n. .",

THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN STEPS, BUT\nWE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THEIR ACCOUNTABILITY IS NOT\nTRANSITORY, THAT IN FACT THEY TRULY RECOGNIZE WHAT THEY DID\nAND THAT THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE FURTHER STEPS AND ALSO THERE IS\nAN ISSUE OF HOW FAR THE ACCOUNTABILITY GOES UP AND WILL\nIT BE SUSTAINED OR IS THIS JUST A WAY TO STOP A BAD STORY AND\nMOVE ON. >> YOU WANT THEM TO SAY THEY'RE\nSORRY? >> NO, I WANT THEM TO SAY,\nFRANKLY, WHAT THEY DID, EXPLAIN IT TO THEM, HOW THEY FOUND OUT,\nHOW THEY WEREN'T AWARE OF IT BEFORE, WHICH BROUGHT THEIR\nATTENTION, WHAT ABOUT THEIR INCENTIVE STRUCTURE, DID THIS\nCONTRIBUTE TO THIS BEHAVIOR, IS THAT STRUCTURE BEEN CHANGED.\nWHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO IN FUTURE TO PREVENT THIS AND THERE\nIS A WHOLE SERIES OF STEPS AND NOT JUST ABOUT WELLS FARGO,\nABOUT THE INDUSTRY IN GENERAL. I THINK ONE OF THE CRITICISMS\nPEOPLE HAD ABOUT CONGRESS, FRANKLY, IS THAT WE HAVE NOT\nFOCUSED ENOUGH ON MAKING SURE THAT COMPANIES ARE HELD\nACCOUNTABLE AND THEY PERFORM TO THE BENEFIT OF CONSUMERS, NOT\nJUST STOCK HOLDERS. >> IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE YOU\nWOULD CALL JOHN STUMPF TO THE HILL, BUT YOU PLAN ON CALLING ON\nOTHER CEOs OF OTHER BANKS. THE MORE PROACTIVE THING TO DO\nWOULD BE TO SEE IF THIS IS GOING ON AT OTHER BANKS TO PROTECT\nOTHER CONSUMERS WHO MAY NOT KNOW THIS IS GOING ON.\nWELLS FARGO SEEMS TO BE ADDRESSING IT, AT LEAST AT THIS\nPOINT. WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT CUSTOMER\nAT ANOTHER BANK IS GOING THROUGH THE SAME THING.\n>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, BY CALLING ATTENTION TO IT, THE\nINDUSTRY IS AWARE THAT WE ARE TAKING THIS NOT ROUTINELY, BUT\nTAKING IT VERY SERIOUSLY. AND, SECOND, WE WOULD LIKE TO\nSEE, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE RICH CORDRAY AND THE CURRENCY UP\nHERE, BECAUSE THEY COULD COMMENT UPON WHAT THEIR PERCEPTION IS IN\nGENERAL OF THE REST OF THE INDUSTRY.\nSO IT IS NOT JUST THE CEO OF WELLS FARGO, I THINK IT IS\nGETTING A PANEL THAT WILL FOCUS WIDER THAN JUST ONE INSTITUTION.\nBECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THIS TO BE SOMETHING THAT WE FOUND A\nSHORTCOMING, ONE INSTITUTION, BUT PERSISTENT IN OTHERS.\n>> SO ANY PLANS AT THIS POINT, YOU SAID YOU CALL UP THE HEAD OF\nTHE CONSUMER PROTECTION BUREAU, YOU ALSO CALL UP THE OTC, BUT NO\nPLANS AT THIS POINT TO ACTUALLY CALL ON OTHER BANK EXECUTIVES\nTHAT HAVE THEM ANSWER AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE SIMILAR\nCOMPENSATION SCHEMES IN PLACE? >> I THINK FRANKLY, FIRST OF\nALL, CALLING THESE HEARINGS IS A FUNCTION OF CHAIRMAN SHELBY.\nSECOND, WE WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR AT LEAST ONE\nWITNESS, BUT I THINK THE BEST PLACE TO BEGIN IN TERMS OF\nLOOKING AT THE SECTOR OVERALL IS GETTING THE EXPERT VIEWS OF THE\nREGULATORS. AND IF THEY ARE ABLE TO SUGGEST\nTHAT THERE ARE ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS, BUT THE OTHER\nTHING TO DO AND I THINK IT IS NOT THE APPROPRIATE THING TO DO\nIS SIMPLY CALL PEOPLE UP FOR A HEARING AND JUST ASK GENERALIZED\nQUESTIONS. I THINK IT HAS TO HAVE A FACTUAL\nPREDICATE. THIS ONE DOES.\nWELLS FARGO HAS ADMITTED THIS BEHAVIOR.\nTHIS IS VERY SURPRISING BEHAVIOR.\nTHE CENTRAL ASPECT OF BANKING IS TRUST BY THE DEPOSITORS AND THE\nCUSTOMERS AND THIS SEEMED TO BE A VIOLATION OF TRUST.\n>> ABSOLUTELY. WOULD YOU RULE OUT, DO YOU THINK\nWHAT SHOULD BE PUT ON THE TABLE, AT LEAST, FOR CONSIDERATION, IS\nA CEO WELLS FARGO STEPPING DOWN? >> AGAIN, I THINK THIS IS\nSOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN, YOU\nHAVE TO GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO INDICATE THE STEPS\nTHAT ARE TAKEN. MORE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT WENT ON\nWITH THE HELP, THAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS HEARING.\nTHEN, AGAIN, I THINK IT IS SOMETHING -- A DECISION THAT THE\nINSTITUTION WILL MAKE BEFORE WE EVER GET AROUND TO IT.\n>> WHERE DOES 100 MILLION GO, WHERE DOES IT GO?\nWHO GETS IT? >> IT WOULD GO BACK INTO THE\nTREASURY, ESSENTIALLY. THAT'S WHERE THE FINES FROM CFPD\nGO. THERE IS SOME, I BELIEVE, SOME\nREIMBURSEMENT TO THE CUSTOMERS, THE ACTUAL LOSSES THEY\nSUSTAINED. BUT THE FINE LIKE MOST FINES\nGOES TO THE GENERAL TREASURY. >> SENATOR, WE'LL LEAVE IT\nTHERE, THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.\nSENATOR JACK REED OF RHODE ISLAND.\nWE'LL HAVE MUCH MORE ON THE WELLS FARGO ACCOUNT SCANDAL ON\nCLOSING BELL AT 3:00 P.M.

SO FAR SO GOOD APPARENTLY.\n>> IT IS REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE IT IS PENT UP DEMAND.\nAPPLE SHARES DOING NICELY IN THE SESSION THAT IS OTHERWISE A\nDIFFICULT ONE. WELLS FARGO SHARES GOING THE\nOTHER WAY FALLING AFTER THE COMPANY DROPPED THE SALES GOALS\nTYING TO THE ACCOUNT SCANDAL. MORE THAN 35 MILLION SHARES\nTRADED HANDS WITH SHARES DOWN ALMOST 4%.\n>> SOURCES SAY SHARES DOWN AROUND 4% AS THE COMPANY\nELIMINATED PRODUCT SALES. SPEAKING AT THE CONFERENCE CFO\nTRIED TO CALM INVESTORS SAYING THIS WOULD NOT IMPACT EARNINGS\nMPTD. >> THE SALES GOALS WERE NOT\nLEADING STRONG PERFORMERS TO BE THE BEST PERFORMERS.\nSALES GOALS WE BELIEVE WERE CAUSING LOWER PERFORMERS TO BE\nWILLING TO TAKE EXTRA STAFF. THAT IS MY TAKE IS PERFORMANCE\nMANAGEMENT. HE ADDED DESPITE SIGNIFICANT\nPRESS COVERAGE THEY HAD VERY LOW VOLUMES OF CUSTOMER REACTION AND\nTHAT FULL FINE HAS ALREADY BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE NUMBERS\nTHUS WITH RESPECT TO THIS MATTER THIS IS ALL THAT THERE IS TO\nKNOW. IT IS A COMPLETED MATTER.\nDESPITE THE BEST HOPES SHARE PRICE SUGGESTS THE 4% SLIDE\nRESULTING IN JP MORGAN SURPASSING WELLS FARGO AS\nBIGGEST U.S. BANK BY MARKET CAPITALIZATION WHILE THERE\nCONTINUES TO BE NO ADMISSION OF GUILT INCLUDED IN THE PUNISHMENT\nOF THE CFPB. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nTODAY THE SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE INFORMED CEO IT WANTS\nHIM TO APPEAR AT HEARING ONE WEEK FROM TODAY.\n>> ON THAT NOTE JOINING US NOW IS SENATOR ROBERT MENENDEZ,\nMEMBER OF SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE.\nWELCOME. >> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.\n>> WHAT ARE YOU MOST TRYING TO FIND OUT FROM THIS HEARING?\nTHIS INVESTIGATION? >> WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO FIND\nOUT IS HOW COULD THE WELLS FARGO WAGON ROLL OVER 2 MILLION\nCUSTOMERS HAVE A WIDESPREAD NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES OVER 5,000\nOPENING UP ACCOUNTS THAT WERE NEVER ASKED FOR, BANKING AND\nCREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS AND HAVE NO SENSE THAT THERE IS ANY\nRESPONSIBILITY OF THE UPPER LEVELS OF THE COMPANY.\nAND HOW DID THAT GO ON IN WELLS FARGO?\nWHAT LESSON SHOULD WE LEARN? HOW DO WE HAVE SAFE GUARDS TO\nNOT LET THIS HAPPEN AGAIN? AND HOW PERVERSE IS THIS\nTHROUGHOUT THE INDUSTRY? >> WE HAD ROBERT CORDRAY ON\nYESTERDAY. THEY FINE THEM $100 MILLION.\nIT IS THE BIGGEST FINE THAT THAT OFFICE HAS EVER IMPOSED BUT YET\n$100 MILLION TO WELLS FARGO IS VERY LITTLE WHEN YOU CONSIDER\nTHE SCOPE OF THIS. DO YOU THINK THEY WERE FINED\nENOUGH? >> LOOK, I RESPECT WHAT THE\nCONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BOARD HAS DONE HERE, LARGEST\nFINE EVER. I AM A BIG ADVOCATE FOR THEM\nBECAUSE WE NEED A COP ON THE BEAT.\nI WAS AN ADVOCATE FOR THEM WHEN WE WROTE DODD-FRANK.\nI HAVE TO BELIEVE IN CONTEXT HERE $100 MILLION THE COST OF\nDOING BUSINESS. OBVIOUSLY, THERE WAS A CULTURE\nHERE AS IS EXHIBITED BY THE FACT THAT THE CEO TODAY SAID THEY ARE\nGOING TO END THEIR INCENTIVES WHICH OBVIOUSLY WERE PERVERSE\nTHAT DROVE THESE INDIVIDUALS TO DO WHAT THEY DID THAT ALLOW OR\nCREATED THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THIS COULD TAKE PLACE.\nSO YOU HAVE TO SAY TO YOURSELF $100 MILLION IF THAT IS THE COST\nOF DOING BUSINESS THEN IT IS NOT A DETERRENT.\nAND THE PURPOSE OF A FINE IS NOT SIMPLY TO COLLECT MONEY.\nTHE PURPOSE OF A FINE IS TO HAVE AN INDUSTRY-WIDE MESSAGE THAT\nTHIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE AND HAVE A MEANINGFUL CONSEQUENCE SO THEY\nCHANGE THEIR CULTURE CHANGE AND PRACTICE.\nI DON'T THINK THE $185 MILLION TOTAL COST IS REALLY GOING TO\nCHANGE THAT. THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT\nTO ASK THE CEO OF WELLS FARGO. WE DON'T NEED THE STORY.\nWE NEED THE TRUTH. >> IT IS ALSO A QUESTION OF\nWHETHER THE BANK ITSELF SHOULD BE FINED IN A WAY THAT MAKES IT\nMORE MEANINGFUL OR WHETHER YOU ARE LOOKING FOR INDIVIDUALS TO\nBE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. THIS GOES BACK TO THE FINANCIAL\nCRISIS. IN THIS CASE THERE IS AN\nINDIVIDUAL WHO HAS NOT BEEN SPECIFICALLY NAMED BUT IN PRESS\nREPORTS IS SAID TO HAVE RESPONSIBILITY AND MAYBE TAKING\nHOME IN EXCESS OF $100 MILLION WHILE THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING.\nIS THIS ABOUT ISOLATING THE INDIVIDUALS WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN\nMORE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS THAN JUST TRYING TO HAVE THE BANK\nWHICH IS SO ENORMOUS BE THE ONE THAT IS BEARING THE BRUNT OF THE\nOUTRAGE? >> FOR ME IT IS NOT JUST BEARING\nTHE BRUNT OF THE OUTRAGE. IT IS ENDING SUCH PRACTICES AND\nSENDING AN INDUSTRY WIDE MESSAGE THAT SUCH PRACTICES ARE NOT\nACCEPTABLE. THAT CAN BE DONE BY SIGNIFICANT\nFINES. IT SEEMS TO ME AND WE DON'T KNOW\nTHIS, IF THERE IS ANY CRIMINAL ACTION PERFORMED BY ANYBODY IN\nTHE PROCESS OF THIS IF THERE WAS A COORDINATEDEFT TO DO THIS AND\nSYSTEMIC EFFORT TO DO THIS THEN THAT NEEDS TO BE PROSECUTED\nBECAUSE BIG BANKS SHOULD NOT BE TOO BIG TO BE PROSECUTED AND TO\nBE JAILED IN TERMS OF INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY.\nI DON'T KNOW YET BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE FACTS BUT\nWHEN YOU HAVE THE PERSON WHO HEADED THIS DIVISION ULTIMATELY\nWALK AWAY WITH $124 MILLION AND YOU ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT\nCLAWBACK SOMETHING IS WRONG. >> WHAT MORE CAN BE DONE TO\nREGULATE THE INDUSTRY SO SOMETHING LIKE THIS DOESN'T\nHAPPEN? ALREADY DODD-FRANK YOU HAVEN'T\nBEEN ABLE TO ENACT ALL OF DODD-FRANK.\nIT IS STILL UNFOLDING AS WE SPEAK.\nIS THERE SOMETHING ELSE THAT YOU CAN DO TO TRY AND KEEP THAT KIND\nOF BEHAVIOR FROM HAPPENING AGAIN?\n>> WELL, LOOK, WE NEED TO STRENGTHEN THE CONSUMER\nFINANCIAL PROTECTION BOARD. I KNOW MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES\nWANT TO SLAY IT, KILL ITS BUDGET AND AUTHORITY.\nHERE IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHY YOU NEED A COP ON THE BEAT.\nYOU NEED TO AS YOU LEARN THE LESSONS THINK ABOUT WHAT\nREGULATORY AND/OR LEGISLATIVE KAF GUARDS YOU CAN CREATE.\nI WOULD HOPE THAT THE INDUSTRY WOULD COME FORWARD AND SAY WE\nLEARNED FROM THIS AND AS A RESULT OF THIS WE ARE NOT GOING\nTO DO PERVERSE INCENTIVES SO THAT THEY CAN COME FORWARD AND\nBE PART OF THE SOLUTION AND THEN IT IS THE PUNISHMENT SIDE OF\nTHIS. IF, IN FACT, YOU ARE CAUGHT HERE\nTHE PUNISHMENT HAS TO BE SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH THAT YOU\nDON'T THINK IT IS THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS OTHERWISE WE WILL\nSEE ACTIONS LIKE THESE TAKE PLACE TIME AND TIME AGAIN.\nTHAT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE TO CONSIDER.\n>> THANK YOU, SIR. >> YOU ARE WATCHING THAT SENATE\nBANKING COMMITTEE HEARING NEXT TUESDAY.\nBIG INTERVIEW TONIGHT WELLS FARGO CHAIRMAN JOHN STUMPF WILL\nBE ON MAD MONEY. I'LL BET MEMBERS OF THE SENATE\nBANKING COMMITTEE WILL NOT WANT TO MISS.\n35 MINUTES LEFT IN THE TRADING SESSION HERE.\nTHE DOW IS DOWN 245 POINTS. >> SOUNDING A STARK WARNING\nABOUT THE SELL OFF.

DAVID, TO YOU FIRST, A CNN\nREVIEW OF DONALD TRUMP A'S TAX FILINGS SHOWS THIS, THAT TRUMP\nHAS NOT GIVEN MONEY TO HIS OWN FOUNDATION IN THE LAST EIGHT\nYEARS, INSTEAD TRUMP GOT INDIVIDUAL DONATIONS.\nNBC GAVE $500,000. COMEDY CENTRAL GAVE $400,000.\nWWE GAVE HIM A MILLION DOLLARS. HE DONATES OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY\nAND THE CHARITY TAKES THE CREDIT.\nHOW DOES THAT WORK? >> FIRST REPORTED BY ME, WAY\nAHEAD OF ALL OF THIS. >> HOW DOES THAT WORK?\n>> OTHER PEOPLE GIVE TO DONALD'S FOUNDATION, IT'S A FORM OF LEGAL\nKICKBACK, THE GUY WHO SELLS HIS TIES MADE IN CHINA, GIVES MONEY\nTO IT, THE McMAHON'S WHEN HE WAS DOING WORLD WRESTLING FEDERATION\nEVENTS AT THE CASINOS WHEN HE OWNED THEM.\nTHEY WOULD MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS, DONALD WOULDN'T MAKE A\nCONTRIBUTION BECAUSE HE IN ALL LIKELIHOOD PAYS NO FEDERAL TAX\nOR LITTLE FEDERAL TAX. SO THERE IS NO TAX BENEFIT TO\nHIM. HE WOULD BE GIVING AFTER TAX\nMONEY. SO HE GETS OTHER PEOPLE TO PUT\nTHE MONEY AND IN AND THEN HE TAKES THE CREDIT FOR IT.\n>> LET ME READ THIS BEFORE YOU RESPOND.\nHERE'S WHAT THE POST WRITES. NEARLY ALL OF ITS MONEY COMES\nFROM PEOPLE OTHER THAN TRUMP, AND TAX RECORDS, THE LAST GIFT\nFROM TRUMP WAS IN 2008. SINCE THEN, ALL OF THE DONATIONS\nHAVE BEEN OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY. IS THIS WHY HE WON'T RELEASE HIS\nTAXES? >> NOT AT ALL.\nWE COULD GET TO THE TAXES IN A MINUTE.\nIT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT HE IS NOT RELEASING.\n>> IT DOESN'T SURPRISE YOU? >> NOT AT ALL.\nWHAT HE'S DOING IS USING HIS NAME, HIS CONTACTS TO RAISE A\nLOT OF MONEY, AND THEN HE GIVES IT OUT.\nTHE UNITED WAY DOES THE SAME THING, THERE ARE PLENTY OF\nFOUNDATIONS THAT USE THEIR CLOUT, RAISE MONEY, AND GIVE IT\nTO GOOD CAUSES. IN FACT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION\nDOES IT THAT WAY TOO. >> IS THIS WHY HE WON'T RELEASE\nHIS TAXES? >> NOT AT ALL.\nIF I WERE ADVISING DONALD TRUMP WHICH I'M NOT.\nI WOULD STRONGLY ADVISE HIM NOT TO RELEASE HIS TAXES.\nBECAUSE IF HE DOES, THE REST OF THIS CAMPAIGN WILL BE SPENT\nPICKING APART HIS TAX RETURNS AND PARTICULARLY DEMAGOGUING THE\nFACT THAT IT IS LIKELY HE PAYS A FAR LOWER TAX RATE THAN HILLARY\nCLINTON. AND IN FACT, WHY?\n>> BECAUSE EVERYONE WHO'S A POLITICIAN PAYS THE TOP RATE,\nTHEY'RE BLABBERS, THEY MAKE THEIR MONEY GETTING SPEECHES AND\nTHEN THEIR GOVERNMENT PAYCHECK, BUILDERS HAVE INVESTMENT TAX\nCREDITS, PROPERTY TAX DEDUCTIONS, DEPRECIATION\nALLOWANCES, THESE ARE ALL LEGITIMATE DEDUCTIONS CONGRESS\nCREATED. >> WHY NOT JUST SAY THAT?\n>> BECAUSE HE UNDERSTANDS THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS GOING TO\nDEMAGOGUE IT. >> HE COULD HAVE DONE THAT A\nYEAR AGO, WE WOULDN'T SPEND THE REST OF THE TIME.\nWE WOULDN'T BE TALKING ABOUT IT AT ALL PROBABLY BY NOW.\n>> LOOK AT THE WAY SHE'S CRISS-CROSSING THE COUNTRY\nWAGGING HER FINGER SAYING SHE WANTS CORPORATIONS TO PAY THEIR\nFAIR SHARE. >> BETSY DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT\nPEOPLE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT SHOULD NOT -- YOU DON'T THINK\nTHEY SHOULD RELEASE THEIR HEALTH RECORDS AS WELL?\n>> I DON'T. >> THEIR MEDICAL RECORDS?\n>> I DO NOT. >> DO YOU AGREE WITH WHAT SHE\nSAID HERE. >> I DO NOT AGREE WITH ANYTHING\nMY NEW FRIEND BETSY JUST SAID. I DON'T.\nOF COURSE CANDIDATES SHOULD RELEASE THEIR HEALTH RECORDS.\n>> CURRENT HEALTH RECORDS, I SAID HEALTH HISTORY.\n>> OKAY. >> RIGHT.\n>> I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE LINE IS, AND AS FOR TAXES, THERE'S NO\nLAW THAT REQUIRES DONALD TRUMP TO RELEASE HIS TAXES.\nBUT IT IS THE CURRENT WAY THAT OUR CANDIDATES GO ABOUT\nRELEASING INFORMATION ABOUT THEM.\nAND IN THE LAST HOUR I NOTE THAT COREY LEWANDOWSKI SAID HE\nDOESN'T HAVE TO RELEASE HIS TAX RECORDS HE RELEASES HIS NET\nWORTH STATEMENT AND WE SHOULD BE HAPPY WITH THAT.\nTHAT'S NOT EVEN REMOTELY THE SAME THING.\nAND ABOUT THAT NET WORTH STATEMENT WHERE HE CLAIMED TO BE\nWORTH 10 BILLION. NOW INCREASED TO $11 BILLION.\nHE'S NEVER RELEASED ANYTHING THAT WOULD JUSTIFY HIM BEING\nWORTH 10 OR $11 BILLION. HIS INCOME TAX STATEMENTS WOULD\nHELP US UNDERSTAND HIS REAL NET WORTH.\n>> BY THE WAY, I HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING.\nI HAVE GOT TO CORRECT SOMETHING. YOU SAID THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION DID THE SAME THING. THE CLINTONS PERSONALLY GAVE 1\nMILLION LAST YEAR. THEY GAVE MONEY TO THEIR OWN\nFOUNDATION. >> THAT'S TRUE, BUT THEY DON'T\nGIVE MONEY TO OTHER CHARITIES. A TINY BIT.\n>> THE CLINTONS HIDE. WAIT A MINUTE, I WANT TO GET\nINTO THIS ISSUE ABOUT HIS TAXES. >> THEY GIVE A MILLION DOLLARS,\nWE DON'T KNOW ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, HE WON'T RELEASE HIS\nTACHS. >> THERE'S INCREDIBLY STRONG\nEVIDENCE THAT HE CHEATED ON HIS TAXES IN 1984 AND I SUSPECT\nOTHER YEARS. HITS OWN TAX GUY, UNDER OATH,\nDONALD FILED AN APPEAL. HE SAID HE HAD ZERO INCOME IN\nHIS CONSULTING BUSINESS AND $600,000 OF EXPENSES.\nNO RECORD. HE GOT AUDITED.\nCOULDN'T PRODUCE RECORDS. HE APPEALED.\nHIS TAX GUY SHOWS HIM THE TAX RETURN AND HE SAYS, UNDER OATH,\nGEE, THAT'S MY SIGNATURE, BUT I DIDN'T PREPARE THAT TAX RETURN.\nDID YOU DO HIS TAX RETURN, BETSY?\nTHAT'S A VERY STRONG BADGE OF FRAUD, AND DONALD AS I POINT OUT\nIN MY BOOK, HE'S ENGAGED IN SALES TAX FRAUD, NOT PAYING\nWORKERS. A LONG LIST OF ACTIVITIES THAT\nHE HASN'T BEEN CALLED TO ACCOUNT FOR.\nTHAT'S WHY WE WILL NEVER SEE HIS",

SO COREY CAN SAY, YOU KNOW, OH,\nTHERE'S NOTHING IN THOSE TAX RETURNS.\nWELL, IF THERE'S NOTHING IN THEM, COREY, WHY CAN'T WE SEE\nTHEM? AND IT'S NONSENSE TO BELIEVE\nTHAT IT'S BECAUSE OF AN AUDIT. THERE'S A VERY CLEAR REASON, AND\nTHE THING THAT DONALD TRUMP HATES THE MOST IS WHEN PEOPLE\nGET AT THE FACT THAT HE IS WORTH SO VASTLY MUCH LESS THAN HE\nCLAIMS.
