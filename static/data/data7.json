WE'RE JOINING YOU FOLLOWING TWO\nGRIPPING HOURS YOU JUST SAW HERE ON CNN WHERE WE SAW THE ONLY\nFOOTAGE FILMED INSIDE OF THE TWIN TOWERS ON 9/11.\nSTORIES OF HEARTBREAKING LOSS AS WELL AS STORIES OF INCREDIBLE\nHEROISM FROM THE FIRST RESPONDERS, PEOPLE WE ALL THANK\nAND PEOPLE WE REMEMBER TODAY ON THIS 15 YEARS SINCE 9/11.\nI DO WANT TO WELCOME OUR VIEWERS IN THE UNITED STATES AND AROUND\nTHE WORLD. WE ARE FOLLOWING TWO STORIES\nLIVE THIS EVENING. FIRST, AS I MENTIONED, AMERICANS\nMARKING A STAGGERING 15 YEARS SINCE THE TERROR ATTACKS OF\nSEPTEMBER 11th. THIS IS LIVE PICTURE FROM NEW\nYORK TONIGHT. THOSE TWO BEAMS OF LIGHT SHINING\nUP INTOHE T SKY AS THEY DO THIS DAY EACH YEAR WHERE THE WORLD\nTRADE CENTER ONCE STOOD. 15 YEARS AGO TODAY, HIJACKERS\nCRASHED TWO PLANES INTO THE TWIN TOWERS AND A THIRD INTO THE\nPENTAGON. BRAVE PASSENGERS ON BOARD UNITED\nFLIGHT 93 FOUGHT BACK AGAINST THE HIJACKERS, KEEPING THE JET\nFROM REACHING ANOTHER MAJOR TARGET.\nIT CRASHED INTO A FIELD IN SHANKSVILLE, PENNSYLVANIA,\nLIKELY SAVING COUNTLESS LIVES. THE HEROIC -- THE HORRIFIC\nATTACKS AND HEROIC EFFORTS AFTERWARDS ALL BEING REMEMBERED\nTODAY. THE LIVES OF NEARLY 3,000 PEOPLE\nTAKEN. OUR NATION CHANGED FOREVER.\nTHEIR NAMES WERE READ ALOUD AT THE MEMORIAL AT GROUND ZERO THIS\nMORNING. A BELL TOLLING AFTER EACH NAME\nOF A LIFE LOST. IT WAS AT THIS SERVICE WHERE OUR\nSECOND STORY TONIGHT DEVELOPED. HILLARY CLINTON'S DOCTOR\nANNOUNCING THAT SHE HAS PNEUMONIA AFTER AN ONLOOKER\nCAPTURED THIS VIDEO OF CLINTON LEAVING THE 9/11 COMMEMORATION\nCEREMONY EARLY. TWO LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCES\nTELLING CNN IT APPEARED CLINTON FAINTED.\nTHE CLINTON CAMP IS NOT SAYING THAT.\nTHEY'RE SAYING SHE WAS OVERHEATED AND NOW SAYING SHE\nHAS PNEUMONIA. AIDES HELPING HER INTO THE VAN\nWITH SECRET SERVICE AROUND HER. AFTER THE INCIDENT, CLINTON WAS\nTAKEN TO HER DAUGHTER CHELSEA'S APARTMENT IN NEW YORK CITY.\nCAMERAS CAPTURING HER COMING OUTSIDE.\nSHE EVEN WAVED TO PEOPLE AND SAID SHE'S FEELING GREAT AND\nTOOK A PHOTOGRAPH RIGHT HERE WITH A YOUNG GIRL.\nTHEN AFTER THAT TONIGHT, CLINTON'S DOCTOR RELEASED A\nSTATEMENT READ, QUOTE, SECRETARY CLINTON HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING A\nCOUGH-RELATED TO ALLERGIES. ON FRIDAY DURING A FOLLOW-UP\nEVALUATION HER PROLONGED COUGH, SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH\nPNEUMONIA. SHE WAS PUT ON ANTIBIOTICS AND\nADVISED TO REST AND MODIFY HER SCHEDULE.\nSHE BECAME OVERHEATED AND DEHYDRATED.\nI'VE JUST EXAMINED HER AND SHE'S NOW REHYDRATED AND RECOVERING\nNICELY. THAT STATEMENT COMING FROM DR.\nLISA BARDACK, HER PERSONAL PHYSICIAN.\nTOMORROW SHE IS SCHEDULED TO TRAVEL TO CALIFORNIA.\nTHAT TRIP IS UP IN THE AIR AND THERE IS, QUOTE, SERIOUS\nEVALUATION OF HER SCHEDULE. THAT IS ALL BEING CONSIDERED\nRIGHT NOW. EARLIER TONIGHT I SPOKE WITH CNN\nCHIEF MEDICAL ANALYST DR. SANJAY GUPTA AND ASKED ABOUT HER\nDIAGNOSIS OF PNEUMONIA AND WHAT IT ENTAILS.\n>> THE DIAGNOSIS OF PNEUMONIA TYPICALLY INVOLVES, BESIDES\nDOCTOR'S VISIT, INVOLVES BLOOD WORK, A CHEST X-RAY, THINGS LIKE\nTHAT. THESE ARE THINGS TYPICALLY DONE\nINSIDE A CLINIC OR HOSPITAL, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.\nIT'S A DIAGNOSIS THAT CAN BE TREATED.\nSHE'S ON ANTI-BIOTICS. BACTERIAL PNEUMONIA.\nIT'S A SERIOUS DIAGNOSIS. THE DOCTOR RECOMMENDED REST,\nRECOMMENDED, YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY STAYING WELL HYDRATED BECAUSE\nTHERE'S A REAL CONCERN ABOUT DEHYDRATION.\nWE HAVE THE FEVER, THE BACTERIAL INFECTION ITSELF CAN CAUSE",

HE WAS AT THE MEDICAL OFFICE,\nRAN OVER THERE, GOT SUITED UP, TOOK A COUPLE PEOPLE WITH HIM\nAND MADE SURE THEY HAD THE PROPER EQUIPMENT AND WE LOST HIM\nTHAT DAY.

BRINKLEY BROUGHT THIS POINT UP.\nTHIS IDEA THERE'S A FRIENDSHIP STILL BETWEEN THESE PERSONAL\nDOCTORS AND CANDIDATES. CLEARLY WITH DONALD TRUMP'S\nDOCTOR'S LETTER TALKING ABOUT HIM BEING THE HEALTHIEST\nPRESIDENT EVER AND TALKING -- IT WAS JUST THESE GLOWING TERMS.\nIT WASN'T AN OBJECTIVE LETTER. THE PUBLIC DESERVES JUST\nOBJECTIVE LETTERS ON BOTH SIDES. OBJECTIVE INFORMATION AS OPPOSED\nTO THE EDITORIAL THING THAT MAY COME FROM SOMEONE WHO HAS MORE\nOF A FRIENDSHIP TYPE CONNECTION. ALLOWING MEDICAL RECORDS TO BE\nSEEN, EVEN BY A GROUP OF REPORTERS, I THINK, IS\nIMPORTANT. OF COURSE, DOCTORS AND\nJOURNALISTS ARE SIMILAR IN THIS WAY.\nYOU ALWAYS WANT TO GET MORE INFORMATION, CERTAINLY.\nWITH REGARD TO WHAT THIS SITUATION HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.\nHAVING A DIAGNOSIS ON A FRIDAY AND JUST HEARING ABOUT IT ON\nSUNDAY AFTER AN EPISODE, YOU FEEL AS THOUGH YOU MAY NEVER\nHAVE HEARD ABOUT THIS HAD IT NOT BEEN FORCED UPON THEM.\nWE NEVER HEARD ABOUT THE DIAGNOSIS OF PNEUMONIA.\nTHAT SORT OF INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW.\nIT'S A TREATABLE DIAGNOSIS. SHE IS BEING TREATED FOR IT, BUT\nIT'S ALSO A SERIOUS DIAGNOSIS. AND THAT'S THE SORT OF THING\nTHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO KNOW.\n>> ALL RIGHT. OUR DR. SANJAY GUPTA.\nLET'S TALK MORE ABOUT IT AND THE POLITICS OF IT ALL.\nJOE JOHNS JOINS ME FROM WASHINGTON, D.C., AND OUR CNN\nPOLITICS PRODUCER DAN IS IN CHAPPAQUA, NEW YORK, NEAR THE\nHOME OF HILLARY CLINTON WHERE SHE IS, WE BELIEVE, AT THIS\nPOINT IN TIME. LET ME START WITH YOU, DAN.\nIT WAS AFTER SHE LEFT HER DAUGHTER CHELSEA CLINTON'S\nAPARTMENT EARLIER TODAY. SHE WENT TO CHAPPAQUA WHERE WE\nUNDERSTAND FROM HER PERSONAL PHYSICIAN THAT SHE WAS EXAMINED\nBY HER DOCTOR. HAVE WE HEARD ANYTHING FROM THE\nCAMPAIGN TONIGHT AT ALL? DO WE KNOW IF THAT'S WHERE\nSECRETARY CLINTON STILL IS? >> WE'VE BEEN TOLD SECRETARY\nCLINTON ARRIVED AT HER HOME IN ABOUT THE 1:00 HOUR.\nHER DOCTOR THEN CAME OVER AND THAT'S WHEN -- THAT'S WHEN THEY\nWENT THROUGH EVERYTHING TOGETHER.\nTHE DOCTOR LEFT AND CLINTON HAS REMAINED THERE EVER SINCE.\nWE'VE BEEN HERE SINCE THEN. THERE'S BEEN NO COMINGS AND\nGOINGS. THE SECRET SERVICE REMAINS\nPOSITIONED OUTSIDE HER HOUSE. CHAPPAQUA IS A BORING, SLEEPY,\nNEW YORK SUBURBAN TOWN. THE QUESTION IS, WHAT HAPPENED\nIN THE MEANTIME? WE DIDN'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE\nHILLARY CLINTON IS FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME AND IT'S RAISED A\nLOT OF QUESTIONS. SECRETARY CLINTON IS SOMEBODY\nWHO IS VERY TIGHTLY SCHEDULED. THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO HEADLINED\nOVER 37 FUND-RAISERS LAST MONTH. AND AS YOU'VE MENTIONED, HAS A\nVERY LARGE SCHEDULE IN THE COMING WEEK.\nAS WE'VE REPORTED, SECRETARY CLINTON AND HER AIDES ARE\nDISCUSSING WHETHER TO CANCEL THE CALIFORNIA TRIP THAT STARTS\nTOMORROW. SHE HAS A LARGE FUND-RAISER IN\nTHE BAY AREA. FLIES TO L.A.\nHAS TWO LARGE FUND-RAISERS IN L.A. IN THE L.A. AREA AND AN\nAPPEARANCE ON THE \"ELLEN DeGENERES SHOW.\"\nAND A CAMPAIGN EVENT. AIDES INSIDE THE CAMPAIGN ARE\nCONSIDERING WHETHER THAT KIND OF SCHEDULING IS NECESSARY, A, AND,\nB IF SHE SHOULD EVEN BE DOING ANYTHING LIKE THAT, FLYING, LET\nALONE CAMPAIGNING WITH SOME SORT OF WALKING PNEUMONIA.\nI THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY TELLING THE DOCTOR INCLUDED IN THE\nSTATEMENT THAT SHE ADVISED SECRETARY CLINTON TO MODIFY HER\nSCHEDULE. CLEARLY THE CAMPAIGN SAW THAT\nSTATEMENT BEFORE IT WENT OUT. SO IT'S TELLING THAT THEY LET\nTHAT GET OUT. LET HER SAY THAT.\nIT'S KIND OF A NOD TO THE FACT THEY ARE TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY\nBUT THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY WE ARE FINDING OUT NOW\nWHEN SHE WAS DIAGNOSED ON FRIDAY.\n>> DAN, STAY WITH ME. LET'S JUST SPEAK ABOUT THIS\nSCHEDULE BECAUSE EVEN ON FRIDAY WHEN WE NOW KNOW THAT DIAGNOSE\nI IS OF PNEUMONIA CAME.\nSHE HAD THIS MEETING ON NATIONAL SECURITY, A PRESS CONFERENCE.\nSAT DOWN WITH OUR CHRIS CUOMO FOR AN INTERVIEW.\nSHE WAS PRETTY MUCH GOING NONSTOP ON FRIDAY AND THEN WENT\nTO THAT BIG FUND-RAISER WITH BARBRA STREISAND ON FRIDAY\nNIGHT. >> RIGHT.\nI THINK THAT POINTS TO THE FACT THAT ESPECIALLY NOW AFTER LABOR\nDAY, THE TEMPO HAS JUST PICKED UP TREMENDOUSLY.\nSHE'S ON THE CAMPAIGN PLANE WITH REPORTERS.\nSHE'S ALSO DOING GAGGLES, A NEWS CONFERENCE AND SO ON.\nSO I CAN TELL YOU ALSO FROM COVERING MRS. CLINTON, FRANKLY,\nFOR TWO DECADES OFF AND ON, THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SHE HAS\nOFTEN TRIED TO PROJECT IS STRENGTH AND THAT WHATEVER\nHAPPENS, SHE JUST KEEPS GOING. SO WE DON'T KNOW SPECIFICALLY\nWHY SHE DIDN'T CUT BACK ON HER SCHEDULE OR WHATEVER BUT WHAT WE\nDO KNOW IS THAT HILLARY CLINTON TRIES TO PUSH AND PUSH AND PUSH.\nAND I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS SORT OF INDICATED BACK ON\nLABOR DAY WHEN SHE WAS IN CLEVELAND, OHIO.\nI WAS THERE. DAN WAS THERE ALSO.\nSHE HAD THAT EXTENDED COUGHING FIT.\nNOW THEY'VE GOT A LOT OF PUBLICITY, BUT THE FACT OF THE\nMATTER IS SHE'S HAD SOME OTHER EXTENDED COUGHING FITS AND\nCHALKED IT OFF TO HE FACT SHE HAS ALLERGIES.\nSHE SAID SHE WAS ALLERGIC TO DONALD TRUMP WHO WAS ALSO IN THE\nCLEVELAND AREA AT THE TIME. BUT IT IS CLEAR SHE'S KEEPING UP\nA HARD SCHEDULE. SHE DOES HAVE FROM TIME TO TIME\nTHESE HEALTH ISSUES THAT POP UP AND ALL IT REALLY DOES IS FEED\nINTO THE CRITICS WHO SUGGEST MRS. CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY\nCLINTON, HAS A SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE\nADDRESSED AND CONSIDERED BY THE VOTERS.\nTHEY CAN HELP THEMSELVES BY BEING A BIT MORE TRANSPARENT\nABOUT IT, ESPECIALLY MORE TRANSPARENT THAN THEY WERE\nTODAY. >> LOOK, AND WE'LL SEE FOLKS\nHAVE CALLED ON BOTH CANDIDATES TO RELEASE THEIR MEDICAL\nRECORDS. NEITHER HAS.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS SAID IN RECENT WEEKS HE WILL IF SHE DOES, BUT\nNEITHER OF THEM HAVE. WE'LL SEE IF THEY DO, AFTER\nTHIS. WE ARE GETTING SOME FIRST\nREACTION TONIGHT IN JUST THE PAST FEW MOMENTS FROM TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN AIDES. WHAT ARE THEY SAYING.\n>> ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AIDES ARE\nINDICATING IN A GENERAL WAY THAT DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF HAS SAID HE\nDOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS.\nTHEY WANT TO BE RESPECTFUL OF HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH.\nIT IS BEING SAID THAT THE MESSAGE THEY WANT TO PUT OUT IS\nTHAT THEY WISH HILLARY CLINTON WELL.\nTHEY HOPE SHE GETS MEDICAL CARE, THE CARE THAT'S NEEDED.\nAND ANOTHER SOURCE ACTUALLY TELLS CNN THAT SURROGATES HAVE\nBEEN INSTRUCTED TO BE RESPECTFUL, NOT POST ON SOCIAL\nMEDIA ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH, AND SEPARATELY SOMEONE\nFAMILIAR WITH THE SITUATION HAS TOLD CNN STAFF WAS CONSTRUCTED\nTO KEEP QUIET, NOT POST ANYTHING NEGATIVE ON SOCIAL MEDIA ABOUT\nTHE ISSUE. AND EVEN UNDER THE THREAT OF\nTERMINATION, APPARENTLY TRUMP HAS SAID HE DOESN'T KNOW\nANYTHING ABOUT THIS AND HE HASN'T TWEETED ANYTHING ABOUT\nHILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH EITHER. ALSO POINT TO THE FACT THAT JUST\nFROM A CAMPAIGN STANDPOINT, THIS IS A STORY THAT DRIVES ITSELF,\nAND ALL DONALD TRUMP DOES IS DRAW ATTENTION TO HIMSELF IF HE\nSAYS ANYTHING ABOUT IT. >> JOE JOHNS REPORTING FOR US\nFROM WASHINGTON TONIGHT.

YET THE CAMPAIGN KNEW ON FRIDAY\nTHAT SHE DID HAVE THIS PNEUMONIA DIAGNOSIS.\nDID NOT TELL THE PUBLIC ABOUT IT UNTIL THIS EVENING.\nDO YOU SEE AN OBLIGATION THERE FOR THE CAMPAIGN TO HAVE COME\nFORWARD WITH THIS SOONER?

BECAUSE, OBVIOUSLY, SHE HAS A\nSERIOUS DIAGNOSIS, AND VOTERS AND PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY OUGHT\nTO KNOW ABOUT IT. >> BUT IT'S PNEUMONIA, RIGHT?\nLET ME PLAY DEVIL'S ADVOCATE AND SAY IT'S PNEUMONIA.\nTHIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S INCURABLE.\nTHIS IS PNEUMONIA. SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE GET.\nDID THEY HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO COME FORWARD WITH IT ON\nFRIDAY? >> I THINK THEY HAVE A\nRESPONSIBILITY TO COME FORWARD WITH IT AT SOME POINT VERY SOON\nTHEREAFTER, AND IT SEEMS CLEAR THEY WERE NOT GOING TO UNTIL\nTHEY WERE FORCED TO WHICH OFTEN HAPPENS WITH HILLARY CLINTON.\nBUT I WANT TO COME BACK TO A CENTRAL POINT, AND THAT IS THAT\nWE NEED TO DEMAND OPENNESS FROM BOTH THESE CANDIDATES, BUT\nESPECIALLY THE ONE WHO HAS BEEN MORE GUARDED, HAS COVERED UP\nMORE. WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HIS\nTAXES, EXCEPT WHAT WE'VE READ IN \"THE NEW YORK TIMES,\" \"THE\nWASHINGTON POST,\" ET CETERA. WE HAVE GOT A BLACKOUT ABOUT\nREAL INFORMATION ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S OWN LIFE FROM HIMSELF.\nAND FROM HIS CAMPAIGN.

I AM GOING TO DO IT.\nHERE ARE MY SPEECHES FROM GOLDMAN SACHS.\nHERE ARE MY HEALTH RECORDS. I'VE LEARNED SOMETHING IN THIS\nCAMPAIGN ABOUT MYSELF AND ABOUT WHAT'S EXPECTED OF ME.\nAND I'M READY TO RESPOND AND TO BE MORE OPEN.\nAND LET'S GET ON WITH IT. I THINK SHE'D DO HERSELF AN\nENORMOUS AMOUNT OF GOOD BY DOING THAT, AND IT'S NOT TOO LATE NOW.\nAND MAYBE EVEN THIS EPISODE WILL BE HELPFUL IN THAT REGARD TO\nFORCE HER TO DO THAT.

BREAKING NEWS.\nHILLARY CLINTON, AFTER BEING DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA HAS\nCANCELED HER TRIP TO CALIFORNIA THIS WEEK.\nOUR REPORTER DAN REPORTING THAT NEWS JUST OUT.\nHE'S IN CHAPPAQUA, NEW YORK, WHERE HILLARY CLINTON IS AT HER\nHOME. WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED, DAN?\n>> FEELS LIKE WE WERE JUST TALKING.\nHILLARY CLINTON WILL NOT BE GOING TO A TWO-DAY CALIFORNIA\nTRIP THAT WAS SCHEDULED LONG AGO.\nSHE WAS SUPPOSED TO HEADLINE A LARGE FUND-RAISER IN SAN\nFRANCISCO TOMORROW NIGHT. SHE WAS THEN GOING TO FLY TO\nL.A. WHERE SHE HAD TWO FUND-RAISERS.\nONE WITH LIONEL RICHIE AND ANOTHER WITH DIANE VON\nFURSTENBERG AND AN APPEARANCE ON THE ELLEN DeGENERES SO.\nRIGHT NOW THE NEXT OPEN EVENT WILL BE IN LAS VEGAS WHERE SHE'S\nSUPPOSED TO HEADLINE A RALLY AND SPEAK ABOUT THE ECONOMY IN LAS\nVEGAS ON WEDNESDAY. THIS IS AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT FROM\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN THAT THIS PNEUMONIA DIAGNOSE SIS AN ISSUE.\nI WAS STRUCK WHEN THE DOCTOR PUT OUT A STATEMENT AND SAID I\nADVISED SECRETARY CLINTON TO CHANGE HER SCHEDULE.\nTHE FACT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN ALLOWED THAT LINE TO BE IN THE\nDOCTOR'S STATEMENT WAS FAIRLY TELLING.\nIT NODDED TO THE FACT THAT, A, THIS WAS AN ISSUE FOR THEM.\nSOMETHING THEY TOOK SERIOUSLY. AND, B, THEY WERE SERIOUSLY\nCONSIDERING THE AMOUNT THEY SCHEDULED SECRETARY CLINTON.\nTHE WAY SHE RAISES MONEY AND HAS RAISED MONEY THROUGHOUT THIS\nCAMPAIGN HAS BEEN VERY LABOR INTENSIVE.\nIT REQUIRES HER GOING FROM PLACE TO PLACE, HEADLINING EVENTS LIKE\nTHE ONE SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO DO IN THE NEXT TWO DAYS.\nSHE'S HEADLINED OVER 330 FUND-RAISERS AS A CANDIDATE AND\nOVER 37, I THINK EXACTLY 37, IN AUGUST.\nTHAT'S A LOT OF WORK. AND IT'S A LOT OF TIME SPENT\nRAISING MONEY. THERE ARE SERIOUS QUESTIONS\nWITHIN THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN TONIGHT WHETHER THEY ARE\nOVERSCHEDULING HER. WHETHER THEY HAD TOO MUCH ON HER\nPLATE. AND THE BIGGEST SIGN OF THAT IS\nTHE FACT THAT ON FRIDAY THEY LEARNED SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH\nPNEUMONIA FROM HER DOCTOR. BUT SHE CONTINUED TO DO TWO\nFUND-RAISERS AND A LARGE NATIONAL SECURITY EVENT.\n>> DAN, HAVE WE GOTTEN ANY UPDATE FROM HILLARY CLINTON'S\nCAMPAIGN OR HER DOCTOR SINCE THIS INITIAL UPDATE A FEW HOURS\nAGO WHERE THEY SAID SHE HAS PNEUMONIA BUT IS REHYDRATED AND\nRECOVERING CLOSELY. THAT CAME AND IT WAS HOURS UNTIL\nWE LEARNED SHE CANCELED THE TRIP.\nANY UPDATE ON HER CAMPAIGN HOW SHE'S DOING OR WHY THIS DECISION\nTO CANCEL IT? ANY CHANGE IN HER HEALTH?\n>> NO, THEY ARE BASICALLY SAYING THAT SHE IS RECOVERING.\nTHE SAME THING THEY SAID HOURS AGO.\nSHE CLEARLY TRIED TO SQUASH ANY THOUGHT SHE WAS REALLY SICK WHEN\nSHE WALKED OUT OF CHELSEA CLINTON'S APARTMENT IN\nMANHATTAN. HER CAMPAIGN WAS WELL AWARE\nCAMERAS THERE WERE. THE PRESS POOL HAD BEEN ESCORTED\nTO A POSITION TO SEE HER WALK OUT.\nSHE WALKED OUT, WAVED. SAID SHE WAS FEELING GREAT.\nCOMMENTED ON HOW BEAUTIFUL THE DAY WAS.\nA YOUNG CHILD RAN OVER TO HER. IT WAS STAGED TO SHOW I'M\nHEALTHY. I FEEL GOOD.\nI FEEL OKAY. SHE CAME BACK TO THE HOUR, WAS\nOBSERVED BY THE DOCTOR. MORE THAN ANYTHING, THIS\nCANCELLATION IS AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT SHE HAD A LOT ON\nHER PLATE THE LAST WEEK OR TWO. AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT THEY MAYBE\nSHOULDN'T HAVE GONE FORWARD WITH AS MUCH AS THEY DID ON FRIDAY\nGIVEN SHE'D BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA.\n>> THANK YOU FOR THE BREAKING NEWS.\nTHE HEADLINE, HILLARY CLINTON CANCELING THAT TWO-DAY TRIP FOR\nFUND-RAISING IN CALIFORNIA AFTER BEING DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA\nAND GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME, IT APPEARS, OFF THE TRAIL TO RECOUP\nFROM THIS. 58 DAYS OUT FROM CRITICAL\nELECTION. LET'S BRING IN PRESIDENTIAL\nHI HISTORIAN, DOUGLAS BRINKLEY AND\nDAVID GERGEN IS WITH US FROM ATLANTA AND CNN POLITICAL\nCOMMENTATOR CARL BERNSTEIN, THE AUTHOR OF \"A WOMAN IN CHARGE --\nTHE LIFE OF HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON.\"\nDAVID GERGEN, THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN ON ALL OF THIS IS SAYING NOTHING\nTONIGHT. THEY HAVE NOT TWEETED ONE THING.\nTRUMP HAS NOT SAID ONE THING, AND WE HAVE HEARD THAT THEY\nARE -- THE MESSAGE FROM THE CAMPAIGN IS THEY ARE WISHING\nCLINTON WELL. THAT IS OUR REPORTING FROM\nSOURCES INVOLVED WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.\nHILLARY CLINTON MAKING THE DECISION TO GO OFF THE CAMPAIGN\nTRAIL, NOT TAKE THAT TRIP TO CALIFORNIA.\nYOUR TAKE. >> WELL, AS FAR AS THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN, THEY'RE FINALLY SHOWING THE DISCIPLINE THAT\nWOULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL TO BRING TO THE TABLE A LONG TIME AGO.\nTHEY SHOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING. THE WHOLE COUNTRY WISHES HILLARY\nCLINTON WELL. WE WANT HER TO RECOVER.\nAND IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR HER THAT SHE'S TAKING A COUPLE OF\nDAYS OFF THE TRAIL TO GET BACK IN SHAPE.\nTHAT SAID, I MUST TELL YOU THAT ECHOING CARL BERNSTEIN A FEW\nMOMENTS OOH THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH WISER TO HAVE DEALT WITH\nTHIS PNEUMONIA ON FRIDAY AND JUST PUT OUT A STATEMENT.\nCANDIDATES ROUTINELY COME DOWN WITH ILLNESSES IN THESE\nPRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS. THESE ARE GRUELING EXPERIENCES.\nAND HILLARY CLINTON HAS COME DOWN.\nSHE'S GOT -- BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA.\nSHE'S GOING TO GET OVER IT. SHE'LL BE BACK ON THE TRAIL\nSOON. AND THEN ALL OF THIS WOULD HAVE\nEVAPORATED. AS IT STANDS NOW, SHE IS SEEN\nONCE AGAIN -- EVEN AS SHE WAS TRYING TO TELL I'M GOING TO BE\nMORE TRANSPARENT, SHE'S SEEN AS, LIKE, THEY WERE COVERING IT\nUNTIL THEY WERE FORCED. THEIR HANDS WERE FORCED.\n>> SO, DAVID, WHY DO YOU THINK SHE DIDN'T?\nWHY DO YOU THINK THE CAMPAIGN DID NOT DO THAT?\nEVEN THIS MORNING THE STATEMENT THAT HER SPOKESMAN PUT OUT WAS\nTHAT SHE WAS OVERHEATED. HE COULD HAVE AT THAT TIME SAID\nSHE HAD PNEUMONIA. HE DID NOT.\n>> EXACTLY. IT'S THE MOST BAFFLING QUESTION\nSURROUNDING HILLARY CLINTON AND HER CAMPAIGN.\nTHIS WOMAN IS SO ACCOMPLISHED IN SO MANY WAYS.\nIT'S SO OBVIOUS. IT'S SO OBVIOUS THAT THEY'RE NOT\nHELPING THEMSELVES AND REALLY LIVING UP TO THEIR\nRESPONSIBILITIES AS A CANDIDATE. IT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE THAT\nDONALD TRUMP HAS COVERED UP FAR MORE.\nAND BOTH THESE CANDIDATES OUGHT TO BE HELD TO A HIGHER STANDARD.\nTHAT HAVING BEEN SAID, TONIGHT WE'RE DEAL WITH A STORY THAT HAS\nBEEN GIVEN LEGS. THE ALTERNATIVE RIGHT WAS\nPUSHING ALL THESE CONSPIRACY THEORIES.\nTONIGHT WE'RE INTO A SITUATION WHERE IT IS A LEGITIMATE\nCAMPAIGN ISSUE ABOUT HER HEALTH. PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW.\nI THINK SHE WILL RELEASE HER HEALTH RECORDS.\nDETAILED HEALTH RECORDS, AS I THINK MR. TRUMP WILL BE FORCED\nTO DO WITH HIS HEALTH RECORDS. HISTORICALLY, AS DOUGLAS\nBRINKLEY WILL TELL YOU, WAY BACK WHEN, FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT COULD\nCOVER UP THAT HE WAS IN A WHEELCHAIR.\nAND HYDE PARK WHERE HIS MUSEUM IS, THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF\nPICTURES OF FDR AS PRESIDENT. ONLY TWO SHOWING HIM IN A\nWHEELCHAIR THAT HE COULDN'T WALK.\nJOHN F. KENNEDY LIED ABOUT HIS HEALTH BUT IN RECENT YEARS, IT'S\nBEEN REQUIRED, EXPECTED, ESPECIALLY OF CANDIDATES EITHER\nAPPROACHING OR IN THEIR 70s. RONALD REAGAN, BOB DOLE, JOHN\nMcCAIN, ALL OF THEM HAD TO RELEASE THEIR HEALTH CARE\nRECORDS. >> SO DOUGLAS BRINKLEY, YOU'RE A\nPRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN. SPEAK TO THE HISTORY HERE, A, ON\nHOW MUCH THIS AFFECTS HOW PEOPLE VOTE, A CANDIDATE'S HEALTH OR\nPERCEIVED HEALTH, AND ALSO THE FACT THAT IN RECENT ELECTIONS,\nJOHN McCAIN, FOR EXAMPLE, WE'VE KNOWN A LOT MORE ABOUT THE\nHEALTH OF THE CANDIDATES THAN WE DO THIS TIME AROUND.\n>> THAT'S RIGHT. AND I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING\nDAVID GERGEN JUST SAID. I WOULD ADD ONE OF THE PROBLEMS\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS IS THAT CONCUSSION BACK IN 2012.\nSHE HAD DOUBLE VISION AND WAS SORT OF AN UNUSUAL TWO-MONTH\nPERIOD FOR HER. AND NOBODY REALLY KNOWS WHAT\nTHAT'S ALL ABOUT. AND THAT'S FED SOME OF THE\nCONSPIRACY THEORIES. BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN, THE FACT THAT HERE IT'S FRIDAY, THEY GOT\nA MORNING DIAGNOSIS OF PNEUMONIA AND HAD HER RUN ONE OF THE MOST\nGRUELING SCHEDULES I COULD IMAGINE.\nI'M SURE SHE WANTED TO. IT WAS IN THAT MOMENT FRIDAY\nWITH THAT BASKET OF DEPLORABLES COMMENT CAME OUT BY DOING\nANOTHER FUND-RAISER THAT WASN'T NECESSARY WHEN SHE SHOULD HAVE\nTAKEN A LOT OF THE WEEKEND OFF. SHE'S STARTING THIS WEEK NOT\nONLY CANCELING CALIFORNIA, BUT I'M AFRAID THAT BASKETS OF\nDEPLORABLES IS GOING TO BE HAUNTING HER CAMPAIGN FOR WEEKS\nTO COME. SO THE BEST THING SHE CAN DO IS\nWHAT SHE'S DOING. REBOOT, RECHARGE.\nTAKE A FEW DAYS OFF. MAYBE PICK UP THE ELLEN\nDeGENERES INTERVIEW. MAYBE GIVE THAT THE EXCLUSIVE ON\nTHE RECOVERING OF PNEUMONIA AND GET TO LAS VEGAS AND START DOING\nRALLIES, AND NOT JUST FUND-RAISER.\n>> JEFF ZELENY REPORTING THE CAMPAIGN PRESS SECRETARY IS\nCOMING OUT AND CONFIRMING WHAT AIDES TOLD OR DAN MERICA.\nSHE'LL NOT BE GOING TO CALIFORNIA ON MONDAY OR TUESDAY.\nCARL BERNSTEIN, YOU WROTE THE BOOK ON HER.\nLOOK, THIS IS SOMEONE WHO POWERS THROUGH.\nWHAT DO YOU EXPECT HER TO DO NOW?\nCLEARLY SHE'S RESTING AT HOME. WHAT WILL HER NEXT STEP BE?\n>> I DON'T THINK WE CAN PREDICT. I THINK WE CAN HOPE THAT SOME\nPEOPLE WILL AROUND HER WILL FINALLY SAY, HILLARY, YOU'VE GOT\nTO OPEN UP IN ALL KINDS OF WAYS HERE BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN YOU'RE\nREALLY AT YOUR BEST. AMONG OTHER THINGS, SHE AND HER\nDOCTOR NEED TO BE IN FRONT OF THE PRESS FOR AN HOUR WITH\nMEDICAL RECORDS AND DISCUSSING AND OPEN TO QUESTIONS ABOUT HER\nMEDICAL HISTORY AND DONALD TRUMP NEEDS TO DO THE SAME.\nAND WE NEED TO DEMAND IT OF BOTH OF THEM.\nBUT WE HAVE GOT TO START LOOKING AT THE WHOLE LIVES OF THESE TWO\nCANDIDATES, AND WITH SOME REAL CONTEXT.\nAND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WILL HELP IS AS DOUG BRINKLEY SAYS,\nPERHAPS SHE OUGHT TO BE DOING FEWER FUND-RAISERS AND MORE\nSUBSTANTIVE RELATING TO THE PEOPLE WHO VOTE IN THIS COUNTRY.\nIT WOULD HELP HER IMMENSELY. DONALD TRUMP ACTUALLY HAS DONE\nVERY WELL BY AVOIDING SOME OF THIS FUND-RAISING AND GOING\nSTRAIGHT TO THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY.\nI THINK SHE OUGHT TO TRY IT. AND ENOUGH OF THE HIGH ROLLERS,\nEVEN THOUGH CONVENTIONAL POLITICAL WISDOM SAYS THIS IS\nTHE WAY YOU DO IT. IT'S NOT WORKING FOR HER.\nSHE NEEDS TO REALLY REASSESS IN THESE LAST DAYS OF THE CAMPAIGN\nABOUT GOING TO ALL OF HER STRENGTHS AS SOMEBODY WITH GREAT\nEXPERIENCE, KNOWLEDGE. LOOK, TODAY, WE HAD THE WORLD\nTRADE CENTER 15th ANNIVERSARY. LIFE AND DEATH.\nWE SAW THIS MAGNIFICENT DOCUMENTARY.\nAND WE NEED TO KNOW, WHICH OF THESE TWO CANDIDATES REALLY CAN\nWE TRUST TO FIGHT ISIS, TO DEAL WITH A WORLD OF TERRORISM?\nAND I DON'T THINK THERE'S MUCH QUESTION ABOUT WHO HAS THE\nCREDENTIALS, BUT SHE ALSO HAS GOT TO OPEN UP SOME.\n>> LET ME BRING IN JOE JOHNS, OUR SENIOR WASHINGTON\nCORRESPONDENT BEUSE, LIKE CARL BERNSTEIN, YOU HAVE COVERED\nHILLARY CLINTON IN DEPTH FOR A MATTER OF DECADES NOW.\nLOOK, SHE'S RESTING AT HOME, JOE.\nSHE'S NOT GOING TO THESE FUND-RAISERS ON THE WEST COAST.\nDO YOU BELIEVE SHE'LL DO AS CARL BERNSTEIN SUGGESTS, HOLD A BIG\nPRESS CONFERENCE WITH HER DOCTOR, COME OUT WITH HER\nMEDICAL RECORDS? BECAUSE I THINK THE CONTEXT OF\nTHIS IS SO IMPORTANT. AS DAVID GERGEN SAID, THIS COMES\nIN THE CONTEXT OF SOME TOP TRUMP SURROGATES.\nTHE CANDIDATE HIMSELF MAKING UNFOUNDED CLAIMS ABOUT HER\nHEALTH OR WHY SHE WASN'T ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, THEY SAID.\nNOW THIS IS A LEGITIMATE HEALTH CONCERN.\nTHERE'S THAT CONTEXT THAT NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED AS WELL.\n>> I THINK THAT'S JUST THE QUESTION.\nYOU REALLY HIT ON IT RIGHT THERE.\nHOW WILL THEY HANDLE THIS GOING FORWARD?\nAND 100 DIFFERENT THOUGHTS ON THAT.\nPROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE IS IF YOU VIEW WHAT HAS HAPPENED\nTODAY IN SORT OF THE CONTEXT, THE TOTALITY OF THE CAMPAIGN,\nTHE FACT THAT SHE'S COME UNDER ATTACK AND QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN\nRAISED ABOUT HER HEALTH, IT MAKES IT EVEN MORE PLAUSIBLE\nTHAT THERE WOULD BE A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT RELEASING ANY\nDETAILS OUT OF FEAR THAT IT WOULD JUST FUEL THE FIRE, IF YOU\nWILL. BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT'S\nALREADY OUT THERE, AND WE HAVE VIDEO.\nWE HAVE A LOT OF VIDEO. VIDEO FROM TODAY OF MRS. CLINTON\nHAVING REAL DIFFICULTY. THERE YOU CAN SEE IT WITH THE\nVAN, TRYING TO GET IN. AND IT CERTAINLY LOOKS THERE AS\nIF SHE MISSES QUITE A STEP. BUT THE INTERESTING THING IS,\nTHAT'S NOT THE ONLY VIDEO WE HAVE.\nWE ALSO HAVE THE VIDEO FROM LABOR DAY THAT WAS IN CLEVELAND,\nOHIO, WHERE SHE WAS GIVING A SPEECH AND FOR THE FIRST SEVERAL\nMINUTES, SHE WENT INTO A COUGHING FIT THAT SHE LAUGHED\nOFF. BUT I CAN TELL YOU FROM SITTING\nTHERE, AT THAT LOCATION -- NEED I GO ON.\nWE ALSO HAVE THE COUGHING FIT THERE ON THE CAMPAIGN PLANE.\nSO ALL OF THESE PICTURES, THESE IMAGES JUST HELP RAISE MORE AND\nMORE CONCERNS AND IT, I THINK, TELLS THE CAMPAIGN THAT YOU'RE\nGOING TO HAVE TO HANDLE THIS IN A CERTAIN WAY AND MAKE PUBLIC\nMORE INFORMATION THAN YOU HAVE IN THE PAST.\nTHAT SPEECH IN CLEVELAND, MRS. CLINTON HAD THE COUGHING FIT AND\nTHEN GOT STRONGER AS SHE WENT ON.\nI WAS WONDERING WHETHER SHE WAS GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE\nSPEECH. THE VIDEO AND WHAT'S BEEN GOING\nON RAISES MORE QUESTIONS AS THE CRITICS SAY, MRS. CLINTON COULD\nHAVE A HEALTH PROBLEM. >> POPPY, CAN I MAKE ONE LAST\nPOINT? >> I HAVE TO GET A QUICK BREAK\nIN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH OUR\nENTIRE PANEL RIGHT AFTER THIS. THE HEADLINE AGAIN, HILLARY\nCLINTON CANCELLING A TWO-DAY TRIP TO THE WEST COAST AFTER THE\nDEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT WAS DIAGNOSED WITH\nPNEUMONIA ON FRIDAY.

THEY HAVEN'T ALWAYS CLAMORED FOR\nIT IN ELECTIONS PAST, BUT THERE'S A GREATER DESIRE WITH\nTHIS PARTICULAR ELECTION TO SEE THE HEALTH RECORDS.\nI THINK FROM WHAT'S HAPPENED TODAY, THAT INTEREST, THAT\nDESIRE MAY INCREASE EVEN MORE. >> DR. SANJAY GUPTA WITH US.\nSTAY WITH ME AS WE BRING IN OUR REPORTER WHO IS RIGHT OUTSIDE OF\nTHE HOME IN CHAPPAQUA WHERE HILLARY CLINTON WENT TODAY.\nM.J., YOU WERE WITH SECRETARY CLINTON ON FRIDAY, YOU WERE AT\nTHAT PRESS CONFERENCE THAT SHE HELD.\nSHE THEN SAT DOWN FOR AN INTERVIEW WITH OUR CHRIS CUOMO.\nAT SOME POINT ON FRIDAY, WE NOW KNOW FROM THE CAMPAIGN THEY KNEW\nSHE HAD THIS PNEUMONIA DIAGNOSE. IS IT ATYPICAL THAT THEY WOULD\nNOT TELL THE PUBLIC THAT UNTIL THIS HAPPENED THIS MORNING THAT\nCAUSED HER TO LEAVE THE 9/11 COMMEMORATION EARLY?\n>> WELL, I THINK THAT'S CERTAINLY ONE OF THE BIG\nQUESTIONS RIGHT NOW, POPPY. WHY IT IS THAT CLINTON'S DOCTOR\nDIAGNOSED HILLARY CLINTON WITH PNEUMONIA ON FRIDAY, BUT WE'RE\nREALLY ONLY LEARNING ABOUT THIS DIAGNOSIS TODAY ON SUNDAY, TWO\nDAYS LATER. AND I THINK SANJAY WAS MAKING\nTHE POINT A LITTLE BIT EARLIER THAT PERHAPS WE WOULDN'T HAVE\nEVEN FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS DIAGNOSIS HAD SHE NOT HAD THIS\nSTUMBLE AT THE 9/11 MEMORIAL. WE SAW THAT VIDEO OF HER\nSTUMBLING AS SHE GOT INTO THE VAN.\nSHE HAD TO BE HELPED AS SHE WAS GETTING INSIDE THE CAR.\nAND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS HAVE TOLD CNN THAT SHE DID\nAPPEAR TO FAINT. TO BE CLEAR, THIS IS NOT\nINFORMATION THAT'S COMING FROM THE CAMPAIGN.\nTHIS IS INFORMATION THAT'S COMING FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT\nOFFICIALS. BUT CLEARLY AS HER DOCTOR STATED\nHERSELF, HILLARY CLINTON WAS OVERHEATED, DEHYDRATED AND SHE\nHAD TO BE TREATED FOR THAT. AND ON TOP OF THAT ON FRIDAY,\nSHE LEARNED THAT SHE HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA.\nON FRIDAY SHE HAD A VERY BUSY SCHEDULE.\nSHE HAD A MEETING WITH NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISERS AND EXPERTS IN\nTHE MORNING, THEN HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE, THEN HEADED OFF TO A\nFUND-RAISER AFTER SITTING DOWN WITH CNN'S CHRIS CUOMO.\nSO THAT'S A VERY PACKED DAY. AND AS JEFF ZELENY REPORTED\nEARLIER, SOME QUESTIONS ARE STARTING TO COME UP WITHIN THE\nCAMPAIGN AS TO WHY SHE DIDN'T CLEAR UP HER SCHEDULE MORE AND\nWHY SHE HAD SUCH A PACKED SCHEDULE WHEN SHE KNEW THAT\nTHERE WERE THESE CONCERNS OUT THERE ABOUT HER HEALTH?\n>> YOU'RE IN CHAPPAQUA. THE LAST STATEMENT WE GOT FROM\nTHE CLINTON CAMP OUTSIDE OF THIS DOCTOR STATEMENT, HER PERSONAL\nDOCTOR STATEMENT, WAS NICK MERRILL HOURS AGO 90 MINUTES\nAFTER SHE LEFT THE 9/11 COMMEMORATION CEREMONY SAYING\nSHE OVERHEATED, SHE WENT TO HER DAUGHTER'S APARTMENT, SHE'S\nFEELING MUCH BETTER. HAVE WE HEARD ANYTHING FROM THE\nCLINTON CAMP OR HAVE YOU SEEN ANYTHING IN CHAPPAQUA, HER\nCOMING OUT OF HER HOME, ET CETERA, ANYTHING SINCE THEN?\n>> IT'S PRETTY MUCH BUSINESS AS USUAL HERE.\nTHE SECRET SERVICE ARE POSITIONED OUTSIDE OF HER HOME,\nAS THEY ALWAYS ARE. CLINTON CAME HOME THIS\nAFTERNOON. HAS NOT LEFT SINCE.\nAT SOME POINT HER DOCTOR CAME TO THE HOUSE, CHECKED HER OUT AND\nTHEN THE STATEMENT CAME OUT. AND THE STATEMENT CAME OUT FROM\nTHE DOCTOR. BUT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS, AS\nJEFF ZELENY, AND WE'VE BEEN REPORTING ALL AFTERNOON, IS\nGAUGING WHETHER HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN OVERSCHEDULED, WHETHER\nSHE'S DOING TOO MUCH. A DIAGNOSIS OF PNEUMONIA ON\nFRIDAY. SHE CONTINUED WITH HER DAY.\nMULTIPLE FUND-RAISERS, A BIG NATIONAL SECURITY MEETING.\nSHE'S A CANDIDATE WHO HAS TO APPEAR AT FUND-RAISERS TO RAISE\nBIG MONEY. SHE APPEARED AT ALMOST 40\nFUND-RAISERS IN AUGUST. AND WHILE THAT WAS A HEAVY MONTH\nFOR HER, IT ALLOWED HER TO RAISE A TON OF MONEY.\nTHIS IS SOMEBODY WHO -- IT'S A TIME CRUNCH -- IT'S A LOT OF\nTIME FOR HER TO COMMIT TO FUND-RAISING AND A LOT OF\nENERGY. SO NO, NO CHANGE HERE.\nIT LOOKS LIKE IT ALWAYS DOES. SHE'S IN HER HOUSE.\nWE'RE TOLD SHE'S NOT MOVING FOR THE REST OF THE DAY, BUT THEY'RE\nSTILL TOYING WHERE WHETHER THEY'LL CANCEL A BIG WEEK OR\nPART OF A BIG WEEK OF EVENTS. SHE'S SUPPOSED TO FLY TO\nCALIFORNIA, HER AND HER PRESS POOL ON HER NEW PLANE ARE\nSUPPOSED TO FLY TO CALIFORNIA. THAT'S IN QUESTION.\nDOES SHE GO TO L.A. ON TUESDAY WHERE SHE HAS TWO FUND-RAISERS\nAND A SPEECH? THAT'S IN QUESTION.\nSHE DIDN'T TAKE NECESSARILY THE PNEUMONIA DIAGNOSIS SERIOUSLY ON\nFRIDAY BECAUSE SHE CONTINUED WITH HER SCHEDULE.\nWHAT HAPPENED AT THE 9/11 MEMORIAL SEEMS TO HAVE ELEVATED\nTHINGS AND THEY'RE TAKING THIS MORE SERIOUSLY NOW.\n>> JEFF ZELENY WAS REPORTING LAST HOUR THAT THE TEAM IS\nMAKING A SERIOUS EVALUATION OF HER, HER TRAVEL SCHEDULE GOING\nFORWARD. BUT HE MADE AN IMPORTANT POINT\nWHEN HE COMPARED WHAT WE KNOW AND DON'T KNOW ABOUT THESE\nCANDIDATES, DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH HISTORY\nCOMPARED TO PREVIOUS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES.\nHE POINTED OUT THAT, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE OLDER CANDIDATES IN\nRACES, JOHN McCAIN. WE KNEW A LOT MORE ABOUT JOHN\nMcCAIN'S HEALTH THAN WE DO ABOUT THESE TWO CANDIDATES WHICH ARE\nTHE OLDEST TO RUN. >> THAT'S RIGHT.\nAND THE HEALTH OF BOTH DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON HAVE\nBECOME POLITICAL ISSUES THIS CAMPAIGN CYCLE ESPECIALLY\nBECAUSE THEY'RE OLDER CANDIDATES.\nTHAT IS JUST THE TRUTH. AND I THINK BOTH DONALD TRUMP\nAND THE FACT THAT HE AND HIS SURROGATES HAVE BEEN PUSHING\nHILLARY CLINTON TO RELEASE MORE INFORMATION HAVE IN TURN PUT\nPRESSURE ON THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN TO BE AGGRESSIVE ABOUT ASKING\nDONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN TO RELEASE MORE INFORMATION.\nAND I THINK IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT AT THIS POINT WE HAVE A\nLITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S RECENT\nSTATE OF HEALTH THAN DONALD TRUMP.\nTHE ONLY THING THAT WE'VE GOTTEN SO FAR FROM DONALD TRUMP'S\nCAMPAIGN IS THIS LETTER THAT HIS DOCTOR ACKNOWLEDGED AFTERWARDS,\nTOOK HIM FIVE MINUTES TO WRITE. THERE WAS A CAR WAITING OUTSIDE.\nSOME OF THE LANGUAGE IN THAT LETTER, OF COURSE, HAS COME INTO\nQUESTION. FOR EXAMPLE, THE DOCTOR STATED\nTHAT HE COULD STATE UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT DONALD TRUMP\nWOULD BE THE HEALTHIEST PRESIDENT TO HAVE EVER EXISTED\nIN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. I THINK FOR BOTH CAMPAIGNS,\nTHERE'S GOING TO BE PRESSURE TO RELEASE MORE INFORMATION.\nI REALLY DO THINK AT THIS POINT TRANSPARENCY IS A KEY WORD.\nAND ESPECIALLY FOR THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN.\nTHEY UNDERSTAND VERY WELL THAT THE ISSUE OF TRANSPARENCY AND\nTHEN THE SEPARATE ISSUE OF HONEST ES AND TRUSTWORTHINESS,\nALL OF THESE ISSUES ARE POTENTIAL VULNERABILITIES FOR\nHER. THE FACT THAT SHE WAS DIAGNOSED\nWITH PNEUMONIA ON FRIDAY AND THEN FOR WHATEVER REASON CHOSE\nNOT TO DISCLOSE THAT INFORMATION, THAT COULD\nPOTENTIALLY RAISE SOME QUESTIONS.\n>> THANK YOU SO MUCH. ALSO OUR THANKS TO DR. SANJAY\nGUPTA. WE'LL TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND\nMORE ON THIS BREAKING NEWS. HILLARY CLINTON DIAGNOSED WITH\nPNEUMONIA ON FRIDAY. THE PUBLIC HAS JUST LEARNED\nABOUT IT TODAY. NOW THE CAMPAIGN AIDES SAYING\nTHAT THEY'RE EVALUATING WHETHER OR NOT SHE WILL CONTINUE ON THIS\nPLANNED TRIP TO CALIFORNIA. SHE WAS SET TO LEAVE FOR LOS\nANGELES TOMORROW. WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN 58 DAYS\nOUT FROM THE LEAKED? YOU'RE LIVE IN THE CNN NEWSROOM.          Hmmmmmm.....",

HE HAS NOT TWEETED.\nHIS CAMPAIGN HAS NOT RELEASED A STATEMENT AT ALL.\nTHIS DESPITE THE FACT THAT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS SOME TRUMP TOP\nSURROGATES AND EVEN HIMSELF HAVE QUESTIONED HER HEALTH AND HER\nSTAMINA. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT ALL THIS AND\nTHE OPTICS AND THE CAMPAIGN. CNN SENIOR CORRESPONDENT BRIAN\nSTELTER IS WITH ME AND LONNIE CHEN IS WITH ME.\nHE'S THE PUBLIC POLICY DIRECTOR FOR MITT ROMNEY.\nSO NICE TO HAVE YOU BOTH WITH US.\nBRIAN, AS THE MEDIA EXPERT IN ALL OF THIS, HOW DOES THIS LAY?\nWHAT ARE THE HEADLINES TOMORROW MORNING?\nWHEN ARE WE GOING TO HEAR FROM DONALD TRUMP?\n>> I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN WHY TRUMP HASN'T WEIGHED IN.\nPOLITICALLY IT MAKES SENSE. WHY WOULD HE?\nTHERE'S NOTHING HE NEEDS TO STAY RIGHT NOW.\nTHIS IS BEING DRIFB BY THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN.\nIT WILL ALSO BE DRIVEN TOMORROW AS TO WHETHER CLINTON MAKES THAT\nFUND-RAISING TRIP OR NOT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE OF THE\nMOST FAMOUS PEOPLE IN THE WORLD HERE.\nONE OF THE MOST SCRUTINIZED PEOPLE IN THE WORLD.\nHILLARY CLINTON SOMETIMES RESENTS THAT SCRUTINY.\nSOMETIMES SHE TRIES TO HOLD THINGS BACK.\nTHAT CAUSES REPORTERS TO GET MORE CURIOUS, MORE FRUSTRATED,\nTHEN SHE GETS MORE RESENTFUL. THERE'S A VICIOUS CYCLE IN PLAY\nIN SITUATIONS LIKE TODAY WHERE WE DON'T FEEL LIKE IN THE MEDIA\nWE'RE GETTING ENOUGH INFORMATION FROM THE CAMPAIGN.\nIN TURN, THE CAMPAIGN FEELS LIKE THEY'RE UNDER FIRE FROM THE\nMEDIA. I THINK CLINTON SUPPORTERS\nWATCHING THIS RIGHT NOW ARE VERY FRUSTRATED BY ALL OF THAT.\nTHERE'S A LOT OF IMPORTANT SUBTEXT TO ALL THIS.\nOTHER THAN THIS ONE IMAGE, WE HAVEN'T SEEN CLINTON AND\nREPORTERS WILL CONTINUE TO ASK LEGITIMATE QUESTIONS.\n>> THERE'S THIS IMAGE AND THEN SHOT BY SOMEONE IN THE CROWD OF\nHER SORT OF STUMBLING, HELPED BY SECRET SERVICE INTO THE VAN.\nTHAT'S A TROUBLING IMAGE FOR THE CAMPAIGN.\nLONNIE, LET ME ASK YOU THIS. YOU WORKED ON MITT ROMNEY'S\nTEAM. YOU WORKED ON ISSUES LIKE THIS\nAND YOU KNOW HOW IMPORTANT OPTICS ARE ESPECIALLY 58 DAYS\nOUT. CLINTON'S DOCTOR JUST CAME OUT\nWITH A STAPT AND SAID IN A STATEMENT THAT HILLARY CLINTON\nWAS DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA ON FRIDAY, AND WE WERE NOT TOLD\nABOUT IT UNTIL TODAY. IT RAISES THE QUESTION OF\nWHETHER THE PUBLIC WOULD HAVE BEEN TOLD ABOUT IT AT ALL OR IF\nTHEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN. IF THIS HADN'T HAPPENED.\nIS THIS PROBLEMATIC FOR THE CAMPAIGN NA THE DIAGNOSIS CAME\nTWO DAYS AGO. >> YEAH, POPPY, THIS IS ONE OF\nTHOSE SITUATIONS WHERE, AS YOU MIGHT SAY, THE COVER-UP IS WORSE\nTHAN THE CRIME. I MEAN, LOOK, THE REALITY IS\nTHAT THESE ARE NORMAL HEALTH SITUATIONS.\nTHESE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES WORK EXTREMELY HARD HAVING SEEN\nTHIS UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL WITH GOVERNOR ROMNEY, HOW HARD HE\nWORKED ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. IN 2012 HEALTH WASN'T THE ISSUE\nBECAUSE BOTH GOVERNOR ROMNEY AND PRESIDENT OBAMA WERE IN SUPERB\nHEALTH. THIS TIME AROUND OBVIOUSLY THE\nAGE OF CANDIDATES HAS BECOME AN ISSUE.\nFOR HILLARY CLINTON THEIR CAMPAIGN NEEDS TO ERR ON THE\nSIDE OF TRANSPARENCY. AS BRIAN WAS SAYING GOING\nFOR FORWARD.\nTHEY DON'T NEED TO FUEL THIS ANY MORE THAN THE MEDIA OR THE\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN THEMSELVES ARE ALREADY FUELING IT.\nTRUMP SITS BACK AND CONTINUES TO DRIVE HIS MESSAGE.\nHE DOESN'T EVEN NEED TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THIS, FRANKLY.\nBY THE WAY, THIS WOULD BE A GREAT TIME FOR HIM TO RELEASE\nMEDICAL RECORDS TO SAY I'M PUTTING MY MEDICAL RECORDS OUT\nTHERE. HILLARY CLINTON, THE BALL'S IN\nYOUR COURT. >> OR FOR HIM TO TAKE THE HIGH\nROAD. I THINK WE SHOULD BE HONEST\nABOUT THE SUBTEXT OF THIS TODAY. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FIRST\nFEMALE NOMINEE OF A MAJOR PARTY IN AMERICAN HISTORY.\nDONALD TRUMP TRYING TO SHOW HIS STRENGTH.\nHILLARY CLINTON ALSO TRYING TO SHOW HER STRENGTH.\nIF SHE HAD PNEUMONIA AND SHE WENT TO THE 9/11 CEREMONY THIS\nMORNING, THAT'S A VERY STRONG, BOLD THING TO DO.\nALSO KNOWING THAT TRUMP WAS GOING TO BE THERE.\nWE SHOULD BE HONEST ABOUT THE DOUBLE STANDARDS THAT WOMEN\nSOMETIMES FACE WITH REGARDS TO THEIR HEALTH.\nPORTRAYED AS BEING WEAKER THAN MEN.\nHOW SHE HAVE TO WORK HARDER TO SHOW THEY'RE AS STRONG AS MEN\nESPECIALLY IN WORKPLACES, ESPECIALLY IN POLITICS.\nI THINK WE SHOULD BE HONEST WITH OURSELVES ABOUT SOME OF THE\nSUBTEXT HERE EVEN AS WE RIGHTLY SCRUTINIZE HER HEALTH TODAY.\n>> BUT GIVEN THE CONTEXT THAT SHE IS COMING OFF OF WEEKS AND\nWEEKS OF DONALD TRUMP AND HIS SUPPORTERS SAYING WHERE IS\nHILLARY CLINTON?

BUT YOU NOTED, JEFF, THAT WE\nKNOW LESS, YOU SAID TO ME JUST A FEW MOMENTS AGO, ABOUT HILLARY\nCLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP IN TERMS OF THEIR HEALTH.\nWE HAVE A NUMBER OF OTHER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES KNOWN\nABOUT THEM IN THE PAST. HOW SO?\n>> IT'S REALLY STRIKING, HILLARY CLINTON 68 YEARS OLD, DONALD\nTRUMP A YEAR OLDER THAN THAT. HILLARY JUST TURNED 69 IN A\nMONTH'S TIME. THEY'RE THE OLDEST CANDIDATES\nAND WHOEVER GOES INTO OFFICE WILL, IN FACT, BE THE OLDEST\nPRESIDENT. IN THE RANGE OF RONALD REAGAN\nBUT SLIGHTLY OLDER, I BELIEVE, IF MY MATH IS CORRECT, AND WE\nKNOW LESS ABOUT THEIR HEALTH RECORDS THAN RECENT PRESIDENTIAL\nNOMINEES. NOT IN TIME.\nOF COURSE, THERE HAVE BEEN PRESIDENTS WHO HAVE KEPT THEIR\nHEALTH OFFICIALS SECRETIVE OVER THE YEARS AS WE KNOW FROM\nHISTORY, FDR AND OTHERS. BUT IN RECENT PRESIDENTIAL\nCAMPAIGNS FROM JOHN McCAIN TO GEORGE W. BUSH TO BARACK OBAMA\nTO MITT ROCMNEY TO GEORGE H.W. BUSH AND OTHERS, DUKAKIS AND\nOTHERS, THEY HAVE RELEASED FULL MEDICAL RECORDS.\nIN THIS CASE THAT ISN'T THE CASE.\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN MORE FORTHCOMING THAN DONALD TRUMP.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS RELEASED A LETTER FROM HIS DOCTOR THAT WAS\nVIEWED WITH SUSPICION BY MANY A MEDICAL WORKER WHO SAID HE WOULD\nBE THE HEALTHIEST PRESIDENT OF ALL TIME, BUT HILLARY CLINTON\nHAS ONLY RELEASED A STATEMENT FROM HER DOCTOR, HAS NOT\nRELEASED MEDICAL RECORDS. WE DO KNOW SHE WAS TREATED FOR\nTHAT BLOOD CLOT AT THE END OF HER TERM AS SECRETARY OF STATE\nIN HER TERM, 2013, AND WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED MEDICAL RECORDS\nTHAT HAVE ALLOWED EXPERTS LIKE DR. SANJAY GUPTA TO LOOK AT\nTHEM. JOHN McCAIN INVITED PEOPLE TO\nCOME INTO A ROOM IN ARIZONA TO INSPECT THE RECORDS FOR A COUPLE\nHOURS. THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED IN THIS\nCASE. AMERICAN VOTERS KNOW LESS ABOUT\nTHE HEALTH AND VITALITY OF EITHER NOMINEE AT THIS POINT,\nAND THEY'RE THE OLDEST NOMINEES OF ANYONE IN OUR HISTORY.\nIT IS SOMETHING TO TAKE NOTE OF ON BOTH SIDES, THAT WE SIMPLY\nHAVE BEEN GIVEN LESS INFORMATION.\nIN AN ERA THAT TRANSPARENCY IS CALLED UPON, WE DON'T HAVE THAT\nINFORMATION, AND KNOWING SHE WAS DIAGNOSED FRIDAY, SHE WILL HAVE\nTO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS THAT WILL HAVE TO BE ANSWERED IN THE\nNEXT SEVERAL DAYS. >> YOU SAID TO ME THAT IT'S A\nGOOD IDEA FOR BOTH CANDIDATES TO RELEASE THEIR MEDICAL RECORDS,\nJUST TO BE FULLY TRANSPARENT WITH THE PUBLIC, BUT YOU ALSO\nNOTED SOMETHING IMPORTANT, THAT BOTH THESE CANDIDATES HAVE BEEN\nEXAMINED BY THEIR PERSONAL DOCTORS, NOT AN INDEPENDENT\nBOARD OF PHYSICIANS. >> IT'S A POINT THAT'S COME UP\nIN THE PAST AS WELL, NOT JUST WITH THESE TWO CANDIDATES.\nMR. BRINKLEY BROUGHT THIS POINT UP AS WELL.\nTHE FACT THERE IS A FRIENDSHIP STILL WITHIN THESE PERSONAL\nDOCTORS AND THESE CANDIDATES. CERTAINLY WITH DR. TRUMP'S\nDOCTOR'S LETTER, TALKING ABOUT HIM BEING THE HEALTHIEST\nPRESIDENT EVER, IT WAS JUST IN GLOWING TERMS.\nIT WASN'T AN OBJECTIVE LETTER. I THINK THE PUBLIC DESERVES\nOBJECTIVE LETTERS ON BOTH SIDES, OBJECTIVE INFORMATION AS TO THE\nSORT OF EDITORIAL THING THAT MIGHT COME FROM SOMEONE WHO HAS\nA SORT OF FRIENDSHIP CONNECTION. SO THE IDEA OF SOMEONE HAVING A\nBOARD OF DOCTORS OR ALLOWING MEDICAL RECORDS TO BE SEEN EVEN\nBY A GROUP OF REPORTERS, I THINK, IS IMPORTANT.\nI THINK DOCTORS AND JOURNALISTS ARE SIMILAR IN THIS WAY, POPPY,\nYOU ALWAYS WANT TO GET MORE INFORMATION, CERTAINLY.\nHAVING A DIAGNOSIS ON A FRIDAY AND JUST HEARING ABOUT IT ON\nSUNDAY AFTER AN EPISODE, THE SORT OF FEEL IS THAT YOU MAY NOT\nHAVE HEARD ABOUT IT, AFTER IT WAS SORT OF FORCED UPON.\nAND I THINK THE SORT OF INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT TO\nKNOW. IT'S AN EMINENTLY TREATABLE\nDIAGNOSIS. THAT'S THE SORT OF THING A LOT\nOF PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO KNOW. >> ABSOLUTELY, SANJAY.\nDR. SANJAY GUPTA, STAY WITH US. JEFF ZELANY WORKING HIS SOURCES\nON THIS AS WELL. STAY WITH US, WE HAVE A LOT MORE\nAHEAD. THIS IS POLITICAL.\nWE ARE 58 DAYS AWAY FROM THE ELECTION, SO HOW COULD AN ISSUE\nWITH CLINTON'S HEALTH -- WE NOW KNOW SHE'S BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH\nPNEUMONIA -- HOW COULD THAT AFFECT HER IN TERMS OF THE\nOPTICS OF ALL OF THIS. LET'S TALK ABOUT IT WITH JOSH\nKING. HE'S THE FOUNDER OF THE.\n>> SHE'S NAPPING, WHERE IS SHE, WHERE IS THE ENERGY, THEY POINT\nTO A COUGHING EPISODE, IF YOU WILL.\nTHE FACTS ARE THE FACTS. WHAT WE KNOW IS SHE OVERHEATED\nAND WE KNOW FROM HER DOCTOR SHE HAS PNEUMONIA.\nBUT IF SHE DOESN'T GET ON THAT PLANE TOMORROW TO CALIFORNIA,\nWHAT ARE THE OPTIONS FOR HER AND HER CAMPAIGN?\n>> WELL, POPPY, A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN IN THE LAST 18 MONTHS\nIS THE MOST GRUELING IMAGINABLE. THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE WITH\nCANDIDATES 67 AND 68 YEARS OLD. WE HAVEN'T SEEN THIS SINCE 1981\nWHEN PRESIDENT REAGAN TOOK OFFICE.\nPRESIDENT CLINTON, PRESIDENT BUSH, PRESIDENT OBAMA, THESE ARE\nPEOPLE IN THEIR LATE 40s, EARLY 50 YEARS OLD, MUCH MORE VIGOROUS\nAND READY TO GO FOR THIS 18-MONTH MARATHON.\nTHESE CANDIDATES ARE GOING TO HAVE HEALTH ISSUES AS THEY GO\nTHROUGH THE FINAL 58 DAYS OF THE CAMPAIGN AND FOR THE NEXT FOUR\nYEARS. THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE WHEN WE\nHAVE 70-YEAR-OLD PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY.\nSO FOR SECRETARY CLINTON NOW TO TAKE A FEW DAYS OFF, IF THAT'S\nWHAT SHE HAS TO DO, IT'S NOT BENEFICIAL TO HER BUT YOU CAN\nIMAGINE THAT BY THE END OF THE WEEK, SHE'LL BE BACK AT\nMAINTAINING THE SAME VIGOROUS SCHEDULE SHE'S HAD FOR THE LAST\n15 OR SO MONTHS. WE'LL SEE IF SHE GETS ON THAT\nPLANE OR NOT. IF YOU LOOK AT PRESIDENT CARTER\nSTUMBLING AFTER PRESIDENT REAGAN, PRESIDENT BUSH VOMITING\nIN THE LAP OF PRIME MINISTER, ITIZAWA, PRESIDENT CLINTON\nSTEPPING ONTO GREG NORMAN'S HOUSE AND HAVING A LATE-NIGHT\nRUN TO THE HOSPITAL. THESE ARE WHAT HAPPENS TO\nCANDIDATES. DOES IT TAKE A NEW CAMPAIGN FIVE\nMINUTES TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEIR GOING TO SAY OR SHARE WITH\nMEDIA? THEY NEED TO FIGURE OUT THIS\nCAMPAIGN THIS CLOSELY. >> AT THE SAME TIME, WHAT DO YOU\nMAKE OF THE SILENCE? WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING THAT\nHE'S CERTAINLY BEEN OUTSPOKEN ON HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH, AND\nHE'S TALKED ABOUT HER BEING OFF THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\nHE SAYS SHE HASN'T BEEN. WHAT DO YOU MAKE NOTE OF THE\nNOTABLE SILENCE. >> AS DR. GUPTA SAID, A\n68-YEAR-OLD PERSON STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF A CEREMONY IN\nLOWER MANHATTAN IN A FULL PANT SUIT CAN OVERHEAT.\nYOU CAN HAVE A TOUCH OF PNEUMONIA AND NOT FEEL WELL, AND\nTHEN YOU CAN MOVE ON THE NEXT DAY AND CONTINUE WITH YOUR\nSCHEDULE. I THINK WE CAN BE QUICK TO JUDGE\nTHE SEVERITY OF THIS AND B BASICALLY COME MONDAY, TUESDAY,\nWE CAN BE BACK WITH OUR NORMAL SCHEDULE.\n>> I WAS OUT THIS MORNING. IT WAS VERY HOT, VERY HUMID AND\nVERY UNCOMFORTABLE. WE'VE LEARNED A LOT IN THE LAST\nHOUR. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING\nUS.",

HILLARY CLINTON, WE JUST LEARNED\nIN THE LAST HOUR, DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA BY HER DOCTOR, HER\nDOCTOR RELEASING THAT STATEMENT AFTER HILLARY CLINTON LEFT A\n9/11 COMMEMORATION CEREMONY EARLY THIS HOUR AFTER HER\nCAMPAIGN SAID SHE OVERHEATED. LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE\nPOLITICAL CONSEQUENCES HERE. WE'RE HERE WITH JEFFREY LORD,\nFORMER REAGAN WHITE HOUSE POLITICAL DIRECTOR.\nGUYS, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE WITH ME.\n>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. >> YOU'RE WELCOME.\nWE KNOW SHE OVERHEATED AND WE KNOW FROM HER DOCTOR SHE WAS\nDEHY DEHYDRATED, SHE HAS PNEUMONIA.\nWE KNOW THEY ARE EVALUATING HER PLANNED TRIP TO CALIFORNIA RIGHT\nNOW. JUST FOR YOU AS A CLINTON\nADVISER, YOU'RE TAKING THIS 68 DAYS OUT FROM THE ELECTION.\n>> I THINK SHE NEEDS HER STRENGTH, I THINK SHE NEEDS TO\nRECOVER FROM THE PNEUMONIA, AND HAVING BEEN A CANDIDATE MYSELF,\nIT IS HARD TO PULL A CANDIDATE OFF THE TRAIL.\nTHIS IS FOR THE BIGGEST POLITICAL PRIZE IN THE WORLD\nRIGHT HERE AND SO MOST CANDIDATES DON'T WANT TO SHUT\nDOWN BUT ULTIMATELY HAVE TO BECAUSE YOUR HEALTH IS FIRST.\nI DON'T THINK IT IS GOING TO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT BECAUSE\nIT'S A VERY TREATABLE CIRCUMSTANCE FOR HER.\nIF SHE GETS HER REST FOR THREE TO FIVE DAYS, SHE CAN BE BACK UP\nBIGGER AND BRIGHTER AND STRONGER.\nA LOT OF US KNOW THIS, WE GET THE ANTIBIOTICS AND WE TRY TO\nPOWER THROUGH, IF YOU WILL. THE PROBLEM IS REST AND THE\nANTIBIOTICS USUALLY TREAT WHAT IS THE COLD FLU OR EVEN\nPNEUMONIA FOR THAT MATTER. WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT THE CAMPAIGN\nDECIDES. SHE'S A TYPE A, A VERY HARD\nDRIVER, AND THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT RACE AND A VERY TIGHT\nRACE. >> JEFFREY, LOOK, THE CONTEXT\nTHIS COMES IN IS A CONTEXT IN WHICH SOME TRUMP SUPPORTERS AND\nSURROGATES HAVE BEEN. THEY'RE COMPLETELY UNFOUNDED IN\nANY MEDICAL FACTS ABOUT HER, BUT NOW THERE IS THIS VIDEO AND SHE\nDOES HAVE A PNEUMONIA, AND THE CAMPAIGN KNEW ABOUT IT FRIDAY\nAND THE PUBLIC WASN'T TOLD ABOUT IT TODAY.\n. HOW DO YOU THINK YOU'RE\nCANDIDATE CAN BEST HANDLE THIS?  NUMBER WO, I HAVE NO IDEAED\nABOUT HER HEALTH. I'M LISTENING ALONG WITH YOU TO\nALL OF THIS AND I'M ASTONISHED. AND IN MY OPINION THE CLINTON\nTEAM HAS JUST STUMBLED BIG TIME ON THIS.\nWE HAVE NO IDEA STILL WHAT HAPPENED AND I THINK THAT'S A\nBIG ISSUE. NUMBER TWO, JUST AS A POLITICAL\nFACT OF LIFE, INTERESTING RICHARD NIXON HIT HIS KNEE ON A\nKARN, HE SPENT WO WEEKS FOR A KNEE IN DEKZ.\nON SEPTEMBER 26, THAT DIDN'T GO WELL POR RICHARD NIXON.\nSEPTEMBER 11 IS THE BRIDGE BETWEEN HILLARY CLINTON AND\nDONALD TRUMP. IF YOU HAVE A CANDIDATE OFF THE\nTRIAL AND YOU'RE IN A RACE, THE TIMING IS VERY KRURL HERE\nBECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IF HE'S GOING  JEFF ZELANY JUST REPORTED THAT\nWE KNOW LESS ABOUT THESE TWO CANDIDATES, WHO ARE THE LESS OF\nTHE CANDIDATES. HE NOTED WE KNEW MORE ABOUT JOHN\nMcCAIN, TRACKS.  SKETCH, SHOULDALRY CLINTON.\n>> IRT PR A YEAR. SHOULD SHE PUT HER MEDICAL\nRECORDS OUT THERE? >> I THINK BEING TRANSPARENT IS\nSUPER IMPORTANT, AND IF THAT'S WHAT DONALD TRUMP WILL DO AND\nTHAT'S WHAT THE HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN WANTS TO DO, THEN THEY\nSHOULD DO IT. I THINK IT'S A FAIR ISSUE,\nTHOUGH. BUT I'M NOT SURE PNEUMONIA OR\nCOLD OR FLU WOULD EVEN BE IN HER MEDICAL RECORDS, NOR DOES IT TIE\nINTO A LONG-TERM MEDICAL CONDITION THAT THEY'RE HAVING\nPUTTING ON THE INTERNET. .\nZDS IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, POPPY, SHE SAID SHE WOULD DO THAT.\n>> I THINK THEY'RE SAYING, IF YOU RELEASE YOURS, I'LL RELEASE\nMINE. DON'T THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\nDESERVE TO KNOW? >> WE'RE GETTING THIS VIDEO\nTODAY FROM HILLARY CLINTON AND IT'S NOT THE FIRST.\nTHAT'SLY REAL PROBLEM? >> THE KEY QUESTION, THOUGH.\nYOU'RE A. THAT'S HIS DECISION.\nWHAT CAN I TELL YOU? >> POPPY, WE'D LIKE TO HAVE A\nMORE DETAILED MEDICAL LETTER. WE CAN START WITH THAT, QUITE\nFRANKLY, BECAUSE HIS MEDICAL LETTER TELLS US NOTHING ABOUT\nHIS HEALTH. THE LETTER FROM HER DOCTOR\nLONGER AND MORE DETAIL. WE'RE GOING TAUG ABOUT KEY STATE\nIN THIS RACE, WHAT IT MEANS IN THE SWING STATES.\nWHAT HAPPENED TO HILLARY CLINTON AFTER HER BIG LEAD AT THE\nCONVENTION? ALL OF THAT STRAIGHT AHEAD.",

              "text": "ARE OPTICS AT PLAY HERE.\nBUT I THINK THE CAMPAIGN HAS TO SORT OF WEIGH THE TWO OPTIONS,\nRIGHT, ONE IS TO NOT HEED THE DOCTOR'S ADVICE AND GO ON WITH\nHER TRAVELS ANYWAY. AND THEN I THINK RISK HER BEING\nEXHAUSTED, TIRED, AND POTENTIALLY HER ILLNESS RIGHT\nNOW GETTING WORSE. AND I THINK THE OTHER THING AS\nYOU POINTED OUT IS THAT IF SHE DOES CANCEL HER PLANS FOR\nTOMORROW THEN YES, HER CRITICS COULD POINT AT THAT AND SAY\nLOOK, WE SHOULD BE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT HER STATE OF\nHEALTH RIGHT NOW. I DID WANT TO POINT OUT SINCE\nWE'RE TALKING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND HIS SIDE OF THINGS AND\nWHETHER THERE HAS BEEN A REACTION FROM HIM, THE CAMPAIGN\nHAS BEEN VERY, VERY QUIET TODAY. DONALD TRUMP WAS ASKED VERY\nBRIEFLY IF HE KNEW ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON AND HER HEALTH EPISODE.\nEARLIER TODAY, HE SAID HE DID NOT.\nBUT OTHER THAN THAT BRIEF INTERACTION WITH THE PRESS I\nDON'T BELIEVE THE CAMPAIGN HAS REALLY WEIGHED IN.\nAND REMEMBER THIS IS POLITICALLY A STRATEGY COMING FROM THE\nDONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN. THE CAMPAIGN HAS SAID ON 9/11\nTHEY DO NOT WANT TO WEIGH INTO POLITICS.\nSO THAT SEEMS TO BE THEIR STRATEGY RIGHT NOW.\n>> SANJAY TO YOU, LOOK, THIS DOCTOR, THE NOTE WE HAVE FROM\nHILLARY CLINTON'S DOCTOR, DOCTOR LISA BARDEK, THE DOCTOR WHO GAVE\nHER A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH A YEAR AGO IN JULY SAYING SHE WAS\nESSENTIALLY PERFECTLY HEALTHY TO BE FIT AND PRESIDENT.\nSANJAY, YOU ALSO HAVE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION FROM A\nDOCTOR, RIGHT? THE DOCTOR CAN'T SEND ANY\nINFORMATION UNLESS THE PATIENT GIVES THEM INFORMATION.\nARE THERE ANY OTHER RULES THAT APPLY WHEN THEY'RE DEALING WITH\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY CAN OR CANNOT SAY?\n>> NO, I THINK THE RULES ARE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME.\nTHE CONFIDENTIALITY CLAUSES, AND AGREEMENTS, STILL VERY MUCH\nINTACT. AND DOCTORS, I GUARANTEE YOU\nTHAT DR. BARDEK WOULD NOT HAVE RELEASED THAT NOTE YOU PUT UP ON\nTHE SCREEN WITHOUT SECRETARY CLI\nCLINTON APPROVING THAT. ON FRIDAY, SHE WAS DIAGNOSED\nWITH PNEUMONIA. TYPICALLY TO DIAGNOSE SOMEBODY\nWITH PNEUMONIA, IT INVOLVES SOMEBODY DOING THE EXAM,\nSOMEBODY HAVING A SUSPICION BECAUSE OF A FEVER OR BREATHING\nOR COUGHING EPISODES AS YOU SAID EARLIER.\nTYPICALLY INVOLVES A CHEST X-RAY AS WELL.\nSO SOMETHING THAT IS DONE IN A CLINIC OR HOSPITAL.\nWE DIDN'T HEAR ABOUT ANY OF THAT UNTIL TODAY.\nNONE OF THAT O-- THAT'S -- THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE'RE HEARING\nABOUT IT AND IT'S A MORE SERIOUS DIAGNOSIS.\nSOMETHING VERY TREATABLE, BUT STILL A MORE SERIOUS DIAGNOSIS.\n>> IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT POINT. BECAUSE M.J., TO SANJAY'S POINT\nABOUT IF SHE WAS DIAGNOSED FRIDAY, WERE ALL OF THESE TESTS\nDONE ON FRIDAY. BECAUSE SANJAY, YOU DIAGNOSE\nPRETTY QUICKLY AFTER THOSE TESTS ARE DONE, CORRECT?\n>> YES, YOU CAN GET THEM QUICKLY.\n>> SO YOU SAID SHE HAD A VERY BUSY SCHEDULE ON FRIDAY.\n>> Reporter: THAT IS RIGHT, SHE HELD THAT ADDITIONAL SECURITY\nMEETING AND THEN SHE PROCEEDED TO HOLD A PRESS CONFERENCE WHERE\nSHE TOOK QUESTIONS FROM THE PRESS AND THEN SHE SAT DOWN WITH\nCNN'S CHRIS CUOMO. SO YES, IT WAS A RELATIVELY BUSY\nDAY. AND AS I MENTIONED EARLIER YOU\nCOULD TELL SITTING CLOSER UP TO THE PODIUM SHE WAS SORT OF\nCLEARLY TRYING NOT TO COUGH. AND THEN AS SOON AS THE PRESS\nCONFERENCE WAS OVER SHE TURNED AROUND AND LET OUT A PRETTY BIG\nCOUGH. THESE COUGHING FITS HAVE SORT OF\nFOLLOWED HER AROUND THESE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS.\nAND SHE HAS SAID THEY WERE ALLERGIES.\nHER DOCTOR SAID IN FACT TODAY SHE HAD AN ALLERGY-RELATED COUGH\nBUT OBVIOUSLY WE KNOW NOW THE DIAGNOSIS OF FRIDAY IS THAT SHE\nHAS PNEUMONIA. >> AND FINALLY, TO YOU, SANJAY,\nFINALLY BEFORE I GET A BREAK IN HERE JUST ON ALL THAT HAS\nDEVELOPED IN THE PAST TOO MOMENTS, WE WENT INTO HER\nMEDICAL HISTORY THE FACT SHE HAD THAT BLOOD CLOT BACK IN 2012.\nAND HER DOCTOR SAID SE HAS BEEN COMPLETELY CLEARED OF THAT WITH\nNO SIDE EFFECTS OF MEDICATIONS. NOW DOCTOR, YOUR THOUGHTS.\n>> COMMON THINGS ARE COMMON, THAT GOES WITHOUT SAYING.\nSO THE IDEA SOMEBODY WOULD HAVE BECOME OVERHEATED, A COMBINATION\nOF THINGS, MAYBE NOT GETTING ENOUGH FOOD OR DRINK, THE\nWEATHER CONDITIONS, WHATEVER IT MAY BE THE COMBINATION COULD\nHAVE CAUSED THIS CERTAINLY. THE PNEUMONIA, AGAIN, BRAND-NEW\nINFORMATION. HAD NOT HEARD THAT UP UNTIL JUST\nNOW. OBVIOUSLY IT COULD BE A VERY\nSIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTING FACTOR AS WELL THAT CAUSES SOMEBODY TO\nHAVE FEVER AND CAUSES SOMEBODY TO HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH\nBREATHING AND CAN CAUSE COUGHING EPISODES AND CAUSE THEM TO BE\nHYDRATED. IT ALL SEEMS TO FIT.\nWE'RE GETTING INFORMATION SORT OF PIECEMEAL HERE.\nAND I THINK BECAUSE OF THIS EPISODE TODAY IS PROBABLY THE\nONLY REASON WE'RE GETTING SOME OF THAT INFORMATION.\nDOCTORS LIKE JOURNALISTS ALWAYS WANT MORE INFORMATION, POPPY.\nI THINK HAVING DR. BARDAK ANSWERING SOME OF THESE\nQUESTIONS AND MORE TRANSPARENCY AROUND IT, I THINK WOULD GO A\nLONG WAY BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT IT STILL\nGOING ON OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS.\n>> DR. SANJAY GUPTA, THANK YOU FOR REPORTING, WE'LL BE RIGHT\nBACK AFTER THIS.",

AND YOU SEE HER, SHE STUMBLES,\nHELPED BY SECRET SERVICE INTO THE VAN.\nIN JUST THE LAST FEW MOMENTS, OUR JEFF ZELENY SAYS THE SENIOR\nADVISER SAYS THE TRIP NOW PLANNED FOR HER TO GO TO\nCALIFORNIA TOMORROW UP IN THE AIR, DEFAGAIN, THE TRIP TO\nCALIFORNIA UP IN THE AIR IN THE WAKE OF THE NEWS OF THE HEALTH\nDIAGNOSIS COMING IN. THERE IS AN EVALUATION OF HER\nSCHEDULE GOING ON AT THIS POINT IN TIME.\nTHIS COMES MOMENTS AFTER WE GOT THIS STATEMENT FROM HILLARY\nCLINTON'S DOCTOR, DR. LISA BARDAK, LET ME READ YOU THE\nSTATEMENT, SECRETARY CLINTON HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING A COUGH\nRELATED TO ALLERGIES. SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH TH\nPNEUMONIA, I HAVE JUST EXAMINED HER, SHE IS NOW REHYDRATED AND\nRECOVERING NICELY. THAT STATEMENT COMING FROM DR.\nLISA BARDACK, OUR M.J. LEE REPORTING SHE WAS AT THE PRESS\nCONFERENCE THAT HILLARY CLINTON HELD ON FRIDAY.\nAND THAT SHE NOR ANY JOURNALISTS WERE TOLD OF ANY HEALTH\nCONCERNS. WE NOW LEARNED SHE WAS DIAGNOSED\nWITH PNEUMONIA ON FRIDAY BUT NOW IT HAS JUST BECOME PUBLIC.\nOUR CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT DR. SANJAY GUPTA IS BACK WITH\nUS. THEY ARE EVALUATING HER SCHEDULE\nSERIOUSLY. >> AND GIVEN THAT THIS CAME IN\nON FRIDAY, I GUESS IT IS SURPRISING THAT THAT EVALUATING\nOF THE SCHEDULE HAD NOT ALREADY BEEN DONE.\nIT SOUNDS AS IF DR. BARDACK HAD SUGGESTED THAT ALREADY.\nTHIS IS SURPRISING, WE'RE HEARING ABOUT IT FOR THE FIRST\nTIME. THE DIAGNOSIS IN WHAT M.J. LEE\nREPORTED, ON FRIDAY, TYPICALLY THE EVALUATION IS AN X-RAY OR\nBLOOD WORK OFTEN IS DONE. IT'S A TOTALLY TREATABLE THING,\nNO QUESTION ABOUT IT. BUT IT IS A SERIOUS THING, AND\nSHOULD NOT BE TAKEN LIGHTLY. IT SOUNDS LIKE POPPY, DOCTOR\nWHAT YOU'RE HEARING AND WHAT THE STATEMENT READS THEY ARE TAKING\nIT MORE SERIOUSLY. >> STAY WITH ME, M.J. IS BACK\nWITH ME, AND THE SENIOR ADVISER TO THE CAMPAIGN TELLING HIM,\nCALIFORNIA TRIP, SERIOUS EVALUATIONS ARE UNDER WAY.\nIT DOESN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION WHY THE PUBLIC WAS NOT NOTIFIED\nOF THE DIAGNOSIS TWO DAYS AGO WHEN SHE RECEIVED IT.\n>> Reporter: YEAH, SO WE'RE STARTING TO SEE THE FIRST SIGNS\nTHAT PERHAPS HER TRIP TO THE WEST COAST TOMORROW COULD BE IN\nJEOPARDY HERE. AS YOU NOTED OUR JEFF ZELENY\nREPORTED THAT ACCORDING TO A SENIOR ADVISER, NOW THE\nCALIFORNIA TRIP THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO TAKE PLACE TOMORROW\nIS UP IN THE AIR. ALSO TO NOTE ACCORDING TO THE\nADVISER THERE ARE QUESTIONS NOW AS TO WHY CLINTON WENT TO A\nCAMPAIGN FUNDRAISER WITH BARBARA STREISAND ON FRIDAY.\nAND THAT IS IN REGARD TO THE NOTE ON FRIDAY, THE DIAGNOSIS ON\nFRIDAY. SHE IS TOLD TO REST, ON FRIDAY\nSHE HAD HAD A VERY BUSY SCHEDULE THAT STARTED WITH A NATIONAL\nSECURITY MEETING IN THE MORNING. A PRESS CONFERENCE, AFTER THAT\nMEETING. AND THEN SHE SAT DOWN WITH CHRIS\nCUOMO FOR AN INTERVIEW, AND THEN SHE WENT TO THIS FUNDRAISER.\nSO THAT WAS A PACKED CAMPAIGN SCHEDULE DAY.\nAND I THINK NOW THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS AS TO WHETHER SHE\nREALLY DOES NEED TO TAKE HER DOCTOR'S ADVICE A LITTLE MORE\nSERIOUSLY. >> M.J., STAY WITH ME, JEFF\nZELENY IS WITH US ON THE PHONE, JEFF THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE HEARING\nFROM THE CAMPAIGN, TELL US MORE. >> Reporter: POPPY, GOOD\nAFTERNOON, I'M HEARING AS M.J. SAID, THERE IS REALLY A\nCONVERSATION GOING ON AMONG CLINTON'S TOP ADVISERS ABOUT HOW\nTHEY HAVE BEEN SCHEDULING HER. THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF\nCONVERSATION AND CRITICISM FROM DONALD TRUMP, OH, SHE TAKES NAPS\nAND IS NOT OUT IN THE PUBLIC OFTEN.\nBUT THAT IS NOT ACTUALLY TRUE. IF YOU LOOK AT HER SCHEDULE,\nREALLY, I COVERED FIVE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS, ONE OF\nTHE MOST SCHEDULED CANDIDATES THAT I HAVE SEEN.\nAND IN THIS CASE, SOME ADVISERS WONDER IF SHE HAS BEEN\nOVER-SCHEDULED. AND THE FRIDAY EXAMPLE IS A KEY\nONE THEY'RE LOOKING AT. SHE WAS INDEED AS WE NOW KNOW\nDIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA ON FRIDAY.\nAND WE WERE AT THE BRIEFING ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON, AND THEN SHE\nWENT TO THE BARBARA STREISAND CONCERT FUNDRAISER.\nWHY DID SHE NEED TO BE THERE? THE CHECKS WERE ALREADY IN THE\nMAIL. THAT WAS A BIG USE OF HER TIME.\nAND IN FACT SHE ALSO USED THE TIME SHE GAVE A SPEECH THAT SHE\nMADE A COMMENT THAT SHE ENDED UP APOLOGIZING FOR ON SATURDAY, YOU\nKNOW, ABOUT HALF OF DONALD TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS REPRESENT\nDEPLORABLE PEOPLE. SO RIGHT NOW, POPPY, THERE IS A\nDISCUSSION GOING ON INSIDE CLINTON WORLD ABOUT HOW THEY\nHAVE SCHEDULED HER. AND YOU KNOW, THIS HEALTH\nCONCERN IS SOMETHING THAT IS ACTUALLY PRETTY SERIOUS.\nSHE IS YOU KNOW -- KEEPS A VERY AGGRESSIVE SCHEDULE.\nNO DOUBT SHE WANTS TO DO ALL OF THIS.\nSHE IS NOT ONE TO SAY NO IN THE WORDS OF ADVISERS.\nBUT THERE ARE NOW SUGGESTIONS AND CONVERSATIONS THAT HER\nCALIFORNIA TRIP TOMORROW SHE IS SCHEDULED TO GO TO SAN FRANCISCO\nMONDAY FOR A FUNDRAISER. TO LOS ANGELES ON TUESDAY FOR A\nCOUPLE OF FUNDRAISERS AND AN ECONOMIC SPEECH AND TO LAS VEGAS\nON WEDNESDAY. THIS SCHEDULE NOW IS IN\nQUESTION, I'M TOLD. AND AT THIS POINT THEY'RE\nREEVALUATING THE NEXT FEW DAYS AT LEAST AS SHE GETS HER HEALTH\nBACK UNDER WAY. >> AND JEFF, NOTABLE SILENCE\nFROM THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN ON THIS. >> IT REALLY IS INTERESTING,\nDONALD TRUMP HAS COMMENTED ON HER HEALTH REALLY THROUGHOUT THE\nCAMPAIGN, TALKING ABOUT HOW SHE TAKES NAPS AND HOW SHE IS NOT\nAGGRESSIVE IN CAMPAIGNING LIKE HIM.\nTHEY HAVE NOT SAID ANYTHING AT ALL.\nWE'LL SEE HOW LONG THAT LASTS, I THINK TODAY AT LEAST IT'S\nNOTABLE THAT THEY'RE NOT SAYING ANYTHING AT ALL HERE.\nBUT POPPY, INTERESTINGLY TO NOTE AT THIS POINT IN THE\nPRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN MOST CANDIDATES IN PREVIOUS CYCLES DO\nNOT OF A PERSON'S CANDIDACY, BUT YOU\nDO NOT HAVE TO GO TO ALL YOUR FUNDRAISERS.\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN, SHE HAS ACTUALLY STRUGGLED TO RAISE\nMONEY. SHE SHAS WORKED HARD THROUGHOUT\nTHE SUMMER TO RAISE MONEY AND GO TO ALL THESE EVENTS.\nSHE GOES IN A CLASSIC OLD-STYLE WAY AS OPPOSED TO MONEY COMING\nIN ON LINE AND OTHER THINGS, AND THEY'RE REALLY EVALUATING,\nWONDER FG TING IF THIS IS THE B USE OF HER TIME SOME 68 DAYS\nBEFORE ELECTION TIME HERE, AND THE CONSEQUENCES ARE CERTAINLY\nDEEP HERE, POPPY. >> JEFF ZELANY, STAY WITH ME AS\nYOU CONTINUE YOUR REPORTING AND REACHING OUT TO YOUR SOURCES.\nDR. SANJAY GUPTA, BACK TO YOU. IF SOMEBODY IS BEING TREATED FOR\nPNEUMONIA, HOW ARE THEY TREATED? WHAT MEDICATION DO THEY GET?\nARE THEY ALLOWED TO FLY? >> WELL, IT'S HARD TO PAINT THAT\nWITH A BROAD BRUSH STROKE. IT'S DIFFERING DEPENDING ON HOW\nSERIOUS IT IS, HOW SHE'S RESPONDING TO THERAPIES.\nBUT, AGAIN, AS I'VE BEEN SAYING, IT'S A MORE SERIOUS DIAGNOSIS,\nSO TYPICALLY IN THIS CASE IT SOUNDS LIKE SHE HAS A BACTERIAL\nPNEUMONIA, SO THIS IS A BACTERIA THAT'S CAUSING IT.\nIT'S AN INFECTION OF THE LUNG AND SHE'S BEING TREATED WITH\nANTIBIOTICS. TYPICALLY PEOPLE HAVE FEVERS,\nTHEY MAY HAVE CHEST TIGHTNESS, DIFFICULTY WITH BREATHING.\nWE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THESE COUGHING EPISODES SHE'S HAD\nRECENTLY. THEY COULD ALL BE RELATED.\nBUT YEAH, TYPICALLY YOU DO NEED A LOT OF REST, YOU DO NEED A LOT\nOF FLUIDS. YOU'RE LOSING FLUIDS BECAUSE OF\nTHE FEVER. YOU'RE LOSING FLUIDS BECAUSE OF\nTHE INFECTION. AND THERE IS NOT, I DON'T THINK,\nAN ABSOLUTE RULE AGAINST FLYING, BUT I THINK A LOT OF DOCTORS\nWOULD SUGGEST AGAINST IT BECAUSE OF THE -- COULD IT MAKE THE\nSYMPTOMS EVEN WORSE? I DON'T KNOW THAT IT WOULD MAKE\nTHE PNEUMONIA EVEN WORSE, BUT YOU MIGHT FEEL WORSE AS A RESULT\nOF THE FLYING. THERE IS WANT AN ABSOLUTE\nFORMULA HERE, BUT CLEARLY IT SOUNDS LIKE, AGAIN, ON FRIDAY,\nWE'RE HEARING THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME NOW, SOME OF THAT GUIDANCE\nWAS GIVEN. FALL BACK, GET REST.\n>> I WANT TO GO TO M.J. ON THIS. THE STATEMENT WE GOT FROM NICK\nMERRILL, THE SPOKESPERSON FOR HER CAMPAIGN HOURS AGO, MINUTES\nAFTER SHE LEFT THE 9/11 COMMEMORATION MEMORIAL CEREMONY\nEARLIER, ALL IT MENTIONED WAS OVERHEATING.\nIT DID NOT MENTION THE PNEUMONIA DIAGNOSIS, THE DIAGNOSIS THAT\nCAME TWO DAYS PRIOR. >> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT.\nWE'RE ONLY LEARNING ABOUT THE PNEUMONIA DIAGNOSIS TODAY.\nWE NOW KNOW THAT THE PNEUMONIA DIAGNOSIS ACTUALLY CAME FROM\nCLINTON'S DOCTOR ON FRIDAY. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE\nSORT OF THE DYNAMICS IN THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN RIGHT NOW\nTHAT MIGHT HAVE LED THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN TO DECIDE THAT THEY\nWANT HER TO BE AS ACTIVE AS SHE CAN BE.\nWE ARE TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT JEFF ZELANY AND HE'S\nREPORTING THAT THERE ARE QUESTIONS BEING RAISED ABOUT WHY\nSHE HAD TO GO TO THAT FUNDRAISER ON FRIDAY, FOR EXAMPLE.\nWELL, LOOK, WE ARE NOW IN THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER.\nTHERE IS LESS THAN TWO MONTHS LEFT UNTIL ELECTION DAY AND THE\nPOLLS HAVE BEEN TIGHTENING AND THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS VERY\nAWARE OF THAT. THEY KNOW THAT EVERY CAMPAIGN\nRALLY COUNTS, THEY KNOW THAT EVERY INTERACTION WITH THE MEDIA\nCOUNTS. THEY KNOW THAT EVERY MEETING\nCOUNTS, THEY KNOW THAT EVERY SIT-DOWN COUNTS.\nI THINK THIS IS AT A POINT AT THE CAMPAIGN WHEN THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN WANTS TO MAKE AS MUCH EFFORT AS POSSIBLE TO GET H\nHER MESSAGE OUT THERE. THERE WAS AN INTERESTING MOMENT\nON CLINTON'S PLANE WHEN HER SPOKESMAN WAS TELLING REPORTERS\nABOUT HER PERSONAL STORY. A COMMENT THAT STAYED WITH ME,\nPALMERI WAS POINTING OUT THAT IT DOES TAKE A LITTLE MORE EFFORT\nON THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN'S PART TO HAVE SORT OF POSITIVE MESSAGE\nBREAK THROUGH BECAUSE OF THE KIND OF CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP\nIS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE.\nSO I THINK WE HAVE SEEN SOME SIGN THAT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN\nREALLY IS MAKING AN EFFORT TO GET HERSELF OUT THERE AND TO\nREALLY SET THE NARRATIVE FOR HERSELF ON HER OWN, ON HER OWN\nTERMS, AND I THINK FRIDAY WAS CLEARLY AN EXAMPLE OF PERHAPS\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN OVERSCHEDULING HER DESPITE THE\nDOCTOR'S ORDERS TO REST AND MODIFY HER SCHEDULE.\n>> AND JEFF ZELANY, TO YOU IN WASHINGTON JOINING US ON THE\nPHONE AGAIN, SANJAY SPOKE ABOUT THE FACT IT WOULD PROBABLY BE A\nGOOD IDEA FOR THE AMERICAN PUBLIC TO SEE THE HEALTH RECORDS\nOF ALL THE CANDIDATES. ANY INDICATION FROM THE CLINTON\nCAMP THAT THIS MAY CAUSE THEM TO RELEASE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT\nHER HEALTH, PUT THE HEALTH RECORDS OUT THERE?\n>> IT'S A GREAT QUESTION, POPPY. SO FAR NO.\nSO FAR THE CLINT ON CAMPAIGN HA NOT INDICATED THEY ARE ANY MORE\nLIKELY TO REVEAL A RELEASE OF THE SECRETARY'S ENTIRE HEALTH\nRECORDS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT\nSTATEMENT EARLIER THIS MORNING, IT DID NOT GIVE THE FULL STORY\nTHAT SHE WAS OVERHEATED. THAT STORY DIDN'T SOUND RIGHT AT\nTHE TIME. YES, IT WAS A WARM, MUGGY, HOT\nMORNING IN NEW YORK, AND YES, SHE MAY HAVE BEEN OVERDRESSED.\nWHEN YOU LOOKED AT HER SHE HAD A JACKET AND SHE WAS DRESSED MORE\nFOR A FALL DAY. BUT THE REALITY HERE IS THAT THE\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS NOT BEEN AS FORTHCOMING WITH MEDICAL RECORDS\nAS HAS NOT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. THIS IS AN ELECTION CYCLE THAT\nIS -- IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE HERE, THE AMERICAN VOTERS HAVE\nLESS INFORMATION ABOUT THE HEALTH AND, YOU KNOW, REALLY\nWHAT'S GOING ON HEALTHWISE WITH EITHER CANDIDATE THAN IN ANY\nRECENT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. AND IT'S ALSO THE ELECTION WHERE\nBOTH THE NOMINEES ARE THE OLDEST THAT THEY'VE EVER BEEN.\nWHOEVER IS SWORN INTO OFFICE HERE WILL BE THE OLDEST\nCANDIDATE SWORN INTO OFFICE HERE, AND IT'S A MOMENT FOR THE\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN TO POSSIBLY RELEASE RECORDS IF THEY DECIDE\nTO. DONALD TRUMP HAS NOT.\nCLINTON RELEASED MORE THAN TRUMP.\nHER RECORD FROM THE DOCTOR WAS LONGER.\nWE HAVEN'T SEEN RECORDS FROM OTHER YEARS.\n>> MUCH MORE ON OUR BREAKING NEWS.\nHILLARY CLINTON AGAIN DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA ON FRIDAY.\nJUST LEARNING ABOUT IT NOW AFTER SHE LEFT THAT 9/11 SERVICE EARLY\nTHIS MORNING.",

WE BEGIN WITH AN UPDATE ON\nHILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH, HER PRINCIPAL DOCTOR JUST ISSUING A\nSTATEMENT NOTING THAT HILLARY CLINTON ON FRIDAY WAS DIAGNOSED\nWITH PNEUMONIA. WE ALSO LEARNED IN THE PAST FEW\nMOMENTS THAT ACCORDING TO A SENIOR CAMPAIGN ADVISER, AN\nUPCOMING TRIP TO CALIFORNIA NOW IN THE AIR, SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO\nFLY TO ARIZONA TOMORROW. IN NEW YORK EARLY THIS MORNING,\nTWO LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCES TOLD CNN IT APPEARED THE CANDIDATE\nFAINTED. THE CAMPAIGN MANAGER WILL ONLY\nSAY SHE WAS OVERHEATED AND WAS DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA.\nDURING THAT FOLLOW-UP EVALUATION OF HER PROLONGED COUGH, SHE WAS\nDIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA. THIS IS ALL FROM HER DOCTOR, DR.\nLISA BARDACK. SHE WAS ADVISED TO REST AND\nREVISE HER SCHEDULE. WHILE AT THIS MORNING'S EVENT,\nSHE BECAME OVERHEATED AND DEHYDRATED.\nTHE DOCTOR SAID HE HAS EXAMINED HER AND SHE IS NOW REHYDRATED\nAND RECOVERING NICELY. THIS IS AFTER SHE WAS DIAGNOSED\nIN HER HOME IN CHAPPAQUA, NEW YORK.\nAFTER CLINTON LEFT THAT CEREMONY, SHE WENT TO HER\nDAUGHTER CHELSEA'S APARTMENT IN NEW YORK AND THEN WENT HOME WITH\nWHERE SHE WAS, AS WE KNOW, EXAMINED BY HER DOCTOR.\nM.J. LEE IS ALSO OUTSIDE THE APARTMENT OF CHELSEA CLINTON\nWHERE HILLARY CLINTON WENT, AND JEFF ZELANY IS ON THE PHONE WITH\nUS FROM WASHINGTON WITH ADDITIONAL REPORTING.\nSANJAY, LET'S GET YOUR REACTION TO THE NEWS THAT NOT ONLY\nSECRETARY CLINTON HAS PNEUMONIA, BUT THIS KDIAGNOSIS CAME ON\nFRIDAY AND THE PUBLIC DIDN'T LEARN ABOUT IT UNTIL JUST NOW.\n>> THAT WAS A BIT SURPRISING, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THERE WAS A\nSTATEMENT MADE AFTER SHE HAD THIS EPISODE WHERE SHE HAD\nDIFFICULTY GETTING INTO THE VAN. NO MENTION OF THE PNEUMONIA AT\nTHAT TIME, JUST SAYING SHE FELT OVERHEATED, ATTRIBUTING THE\nSYMPTOMS TO THAT. THE DIAGNOSIS OF PNEUMONIA\nTYPICALLY INVOLVES, BESIDES DOCTORS' VISITS, TYPICALLY\nINVOLVES BLOODWORK, CHEST X-RAYS, THINGS LIKE THAT.\nTHIS IS TYPICALLY DONE IN A CLINIC OR HOSPITAL OR SOMETHING\nLIKE THAT. IT'S A DIAGNOSIS THAT CAN BE\nTREATED. SHE'S ON ANTIBIOTICS WHICH MEANS\nA BACTERIAL PNEUMONIA. BUT IT'S A SERIOUS DIAGNOSIS.\nTHE DOCTOR RECOMMENDED REST, RECOMMENDED OBVIOUSLY STAYING\nWELL HYDRATED BECAUSE THERE IS A REAL CONCERN ABOUT DEHYDRATION.\nYOU'VE GOT THE FEVER. THE BACTERIAL INFECTION ITSELF\nCAN CAUSE THE DEHYDRATION. SO IT MAKES SENSE TO FIT THIS\nSTUFF TOGETHER, BUT IT STILL FEELS LIKE THERE IS A BEAT\nMISSING HERE. WE GOT INFORMATION LATE AND IT\nSTILL SEEMS INCOMPLETE. >> M.J. LEE, TO YOU.\nYOU WERE WITH SECRETARY CLINTON ON FRIDAY.\nYOU WERE AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE THAT SHE HELD.\nYOU KNOW SHE HAD A VERY, VERY BUSY SCHEDULE ON FRIDAY.\nARE YOU HEARING ANYTHING ELSE FROM THE CAMPAIGN AT THIS TIME?\nTHE LAST STATEMENT I BELIEVE WE RECEIVED FROM THE CAMPAIGN WAS\nHOURS AGO FROM NICK MERRILL WHO SAID SHE OVERHEATED.\nNOW THE DOCTOR SAYING THE PNEUMONIA DIAGNOSIS.\nANYTHING ELSE OFFICIAL FROM THE CAMP?\n>> NO WORD YET FROM THE CAMPAIGN AFTER THIS DOCTOR'S NOTE WAS\nRELEASED. WE DO NOT KNOW IF CLINTON WILL\nCONTINUE WITH HER CALIFORNIA TRIP TOMORROW.\nSHE WAS SET TO FLY OUT TO SAN FRANCISCO AND THEN GO TO L.A.\nSHE HAD MULTIPLE FUNDRAISERS AND EVENTS PLANNED FOR THIS WEEK, A\nBIG WEST COAST SWING. AND I THINK THE OTHER QUESTION\nTHAT THE CAMPAIGN POTENTIALLY NEEDS TO ADDRESS AND CERTAINLY\nWILL BE ASKED ABOUT A LOT IS WHY THE CAMPAIGN DIDN'T DISCLOSE ON\nFRIDAY, WHICH IS WHEN THE DOCTOR SAYS CLINTON WAS DIAGNOSED WITH\nPNEUMONIA, WHY THE CAMPAIGN DIDN'T MAKE THIS PUBLIC ON THAT\nDAY. I THINK TODAY, LEARNING THAT SHE\nWAS OVERHEATED, DEHYDRATED, THAT SORT OF SEEMS TO EXPLAIN WHY SHE\nSEEMED TO STUMBLE. SOME LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS\nSAID SHE APPEARED TO EVEN FAINT AS SHE WAS GETTING INTO THE VAN.\nBUT I THINK THE QUESTION ABOUT WHY THE PNEUMONIA DIAGNOSIS CAME\nON FRIDAY, BUT SHE DIDN'T ACTUALLY DISCLOSE THAT\nINFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC UNTIL TODAY, I THINK THAT'S A QUESTION\nTHAT THE CAMPAIGN WILL HAVE TO ANSWER OR WILL CERTAINLY BE\nASKED. >> AND JEFF ZELANY, TO YOU,",

SHE SORT OF STUMBLES, AND W\nWOBBLES A BIT. SHE DID COME OUT AND SPEAK TO\nTHE PRESS SAYING QUOTE, SHE FEELS GREAT.\nBUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE OPTICS OF THIS, 60 DAYS AWAY,\nTHERE ARE QUESTIONS PEOPLE HAVE. LET'S BRING IN OUR COMNN\nCORRESPONDENT FROM AUSTIN, TEXAS, ALL WE KNOW IS FROM HER\nCAMPAIGN SHE OVERHEATED. TWO LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCES ARE\nTELLING CNN THAT SHE APPEARS TO HAVE FAINTED.\nBUT AGAIN, THAT IS NOT CONFIRMED BY HER DOCTOR OR CAMPAIGN.\nWHAT DOES HISTORY TEACH US ABOUT HOW CONCERNED VOTERS ARE ABOUT\nTHE HEALTH OF THE CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR THE WHITE HOUSE?\n>> Reporter: WELL, WE'RE CONCERNED, BUT WE'RE A COUNTRY\nTHAT ELECTED FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT FOUR TIMES WHEN WE KNOW HE HAD\nPOLIO FOUR TIMES, WHEELCHAIR-BOUND.\nSO THERE IS A REASONABLE PERSPECTIVE.\nTHIS IS NOT A BIG EVENT THAT OCCURRED IN MY MIND TODAY.\nHILLARY CLINTON DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.\nSHE HAS BEEN CHRIS-CROSSING THE COUNTRY, I DON'T KNOW HOW ANY OF\nTHESE CANDIDATES DO IT. AND SHE IS OUT IN EXTREME HEAT.\nGOT A LITTLE BIT DIZZY. AND THERE WAS AN AWKWARD MOMENT.\nBUT THERE ARE TIMES IN U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS WHEN\nTHERE IS A BAD VIDEO BITE WHEN WE SEE HER STUMBLING INTO HER\nCAR, WHERE IT CAUSES PAIN. AND SHE NEEDS TO BE CLEAR WHAT\nHAPPENED AND TRY TO EXPLAIN TO THE PUBLIC WHAT IT IS.\n>> AND DR. SANJAY GUPTA, OUR CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT,\nSAID LOOK IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA FOR THE CANDIDATES TO\nRELEASE THEIR HEALTH RECORDS AND FRANKLY HAVE AN INDEPENDENT\nBOARD OF DOCTORS WHO RELEASE THEIR INFORMATION, WHO YOU OFTEN\nBECOME FRIENDS WITH. WHAT IS THE HISTORICAL PRECEDENT\nFOR THAT, OR IS THERE NONE TO GET HEALTH RECORDS FOR\nCANDIDATES? >> WELL, I AGREE WITH HIM THAT\nWOULD BE IDEAL. BUT WE'RE ALSO VERY LATE IN THE\nGAME RIGHT NOW. THERE ARE TIMES WHEN CANDIDATES'\nHEALTHS JUST CAUSES BIG PROBLEMS.\nI MEAN THINK ABOUT THOMAS EAGLETON, RUNNING FOR CANDIDATE.\nHE HAD A BACKGROUND OF MENTAL ILLNESS, IT EVENTUALLY BROKE\nLOOSE. IT COST GEORGE McGOVERN TERRIBLY\nTO NOT BE TRANSPARENT ON THAT. I REMEMBER IN 1992, WHEN GEORGE\nHERBERT BUSH THREW UP ON A JAP\nJAPANESE VISITOR. SO THAT BITE WAS VERY HAUNTING.\nI THINK WE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF SOMEBODY\nRUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. THESE CANDIDATES ALL HAVE THEIR\nOWN DOCTORS WHO WILL SAY THEY'RE FIT AS A FIDDLE.\nIT'S IMPORTANT FOR HILLARY CLINTON NOT TO DO WHAT JOHN\nKENNEDY DID IN 1962 AND TRY TO HIDE A CONDITION.\nSHE NEEDS TO BE TRANSPARENT WHERE SHE IS AT, WHAT HAPPENED\nWITH HER CONCUSSION AND JUST BE FRANK WITH WHAT HAPPENED.\nSHE NEEDS TO GET ON A PLANE AND GO TO SAN FRANCISCO AND KEEP GET\nON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, OR WILL THIS MAKE HER CANCEL?\nWE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE. >> WHY DO YOU SAY IT'S KEY IF\nSHE GETS ON THE PLANE. IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT -- THESE\nCANDIDATES ARE FLYING ACROSS THE COUNTRY BACK AND FORTH AND\nCLEARLY WHAT THEY DO IS EXHAUSTING.\nARE YOU SAYING SHE HAS TO GET ON THAT PLANE OR ELSE THE OPTICS\nARE JUST GOING TO BE TOO TOUGH FOR HER?\n>> WELL, IF SHE IS NOT GOING TO INVITE A DOCTOR TO CHAPPAQUA,\nFOR THE GET BAGS OF FLUID IF SHE WAS DEHYDRATED AND REALLY WAS\nJUST FINE, FELT DIZZY, THAT MEANS SHE WOULD BE ONWARD TO\nCALIFORNIA. BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO FEED INTO\nTHE CAMPAIGN'S NOTION THAT SHE IS UNFIT TO COMMAND AND SHE HAS\nBEEN COVERING UP HER HEALTH WOES FOR A WHILE, SO IF SHE CAN GET\nON THAT PLANE TOMORROW, I CERTAINLY WOULD DO IT.\n>> DOUGLAS HINCKLEY THANK YOU.",

              "text": "BREAKING NEWS INTO CNN.\nAN UPDATE ON PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HILLARY CLINTON'S\nHEALTH. WHAT WE HAVE JUST LEARNED FROM\nAN AIDE IS THAT HILLARY CLINTON'S DOCTOR ATTENDED TO HER\nHOME IN CHAPPAQUA TODAY AFTER SHE ARRIVED THERE.\nAND HERE IS THE FULL STATEMENT FROM HER DOCTOR, THE CHAIRMAN OF\nINTERNAL MEDICINE. SECRETARY CLINTON HAS BEEN\nEXPERIENCING A COUGH RELATED TO ALLERGIES.\nON FRIDAY, AFTER A FOLLOW-UP SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA AND\nPUT ON ANTIBIOTICS AND ADVISED TO REST AND MONITOR HER\nSCHEDULE. WHILE AT THIS MORNING'S EVENT,\nSHE BECAME OVERHEATED AND DEHYDRATED.\nSHE IS NOW REHYDRATED. SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH\nPNEUMONIA. CHECKED BY HER DOCTOR, THE\nDOCTOR SAID SHE IS RECOVERING NICELY AT HER HOME.\nSANJAY GUPTA, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID SHE HAS\nPNEUMONIA. >> WELL, IT'S THE FIRST OF WHAT\nWE'RE HEARING ABOUT. WE HEARD ABOUT THE COUGHING\nEPISODES SHE HAD. AND THOSE WERE ATTRIBUTED TO AS\nAND EVEN HEARD SHE WAS INCREASING THE DOSE OF HER\nANTIHISTAMINES. PNEUMONIA IS A VERY DIFFERENT\nDIAGNOSIS, OBVIOUSLY MEANS AN INFECTION OF THE LUNGS.\nTHE DOCTOR HAS PUT HER ON ANTIBIOTICS WHICH SUGGESTS IT'S\nA BACTERIAL INFECTION OF THE LUNGS.\nAND IT'S A VIRUS THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY SOMEBODY WOULD\nCURTAIL THEIR SCHEDULE, AND BASICALLY TAKE THE MEDICINES AND\nRECOVER. DESPITE THIS DIAGNOSIS THAT IT\nSOUNDS LIKE CAME ON FRIDAY, WE STILL OBVIOUSLY SAW THE SCHEDULE\nSHE WAS KEEPING WITH THIS PLANNED TRAVEL EVEN TOMORROW.\nAND THEN THE NOTE YOU JUST READ, POPPY, I SAW IT AS WELL.\nTHEY SAY THEY HAD ADVISED TO MODIFY THE SCHEDULE.\nI'M NOT SURE HOW THE SCHEDULE WAS MODIFIED IF IT WAS.\n>> WELL, IT IS INTERESTING, BECAUSE SHE SAT DOWN ON PROVIDE,\nTHE PNEUMONIA DIAGNOSIS CAME ON FRIDAY, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TIME\nIT CAME. ON FRIDAY, SHE SAT DOWN WITH AN\nINTERVIEW FOR OUR OWN CHRIS CUOMO, AND SHE WENT TO THE 9/11\nPLANS AND THE COMMEMORATION CEREMONY THIS MORNING.\nSANJAY, WE KNOW THAT IN SEPTEMBER, NOT LONG AGO SHE WAS\nIN CLEVELAND AND HAD A COUGHING FIT FOR A FEW MINUTES.\nTHAT NOW SEEMS TO MAKE MORE SENSE, RIGHT?\n>> IT SEEMS SO IT'S TOUGH TO PIECE IT TOGETHER, I DON'T THINK\nANYBODY CAN PIECE IT TOGETHER EXCEPT FOR HER AND HER DOCTOR.\nBUT THE DISTINGUISHED COUGHING EPISODE DUE TO ALLERGIES, WHICH\nWOULD BE SOMETHING THAT IS AN ALLERGAN, PNEUMONIA IS AN\nINFECTION OF THE LUNGS, AN INFECTION AS OPPOSED TO AN\nALLERGAN, IT IS TYPICALLY DIAGNOSED BECAUSE SOMEBODY HAS\nDIFFICULTY BREATHING, DONE WITH A CHEST X-RAY AND DONE IN A\nHOSPITAL. SO THESE COULD ALL WRAP TOGETHER\nSOMEHOW. MAYBE SHE THOUGHT IT WAS\nALLERGIES AND THEN THE DOCTOR DIAGNOSED HER WITH THIS\nPNEUMONIA AS TO CAUSING HER COUGHING.\nBUT YOU KNOW, AGAIN, I THINK WE'RE STILL DEALING WITH LIMITED\nINFORMATION HERE. THIS -- YOU KNOW, IT'S TOUGH AND\nIT'S SPECULATIVE WITHOUT MORE COMPLETE INFORMATION.\n>> RIGHT, AND THEREFORE IT'S HARD TO MAKE A JUDGMENT.\nONE OF THE QUESTIONS IS, IS SHE SUPPOSED TO TRAVEL ACROSS\nCOUNTRY TOMORROW TO CALIFORNIA FOR A FUNDRAISER?\nWELL, I GUESS SHE IS NOT YOUR PATIENT.\nYOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SAY WITH THIS MUCH INFORMATION THAT\nIS SOMETHING SHE SHOULD DO. >> ABSOLUTELY, THAT IS SOMETHING\nTHAT IS GOING TO BE TRUE FOR ANYONE, HER AND HER DOCTOR.\nPNEUMONIA, IF SOMEBODY HAS AN INFECTION OF THE LUNGS IT COULD\nTAKE A WHILE TO RECOVER FROM THAT.\nYOU ARE DEHYDRATED AND OFTENTIMES HAVE FEVERS.\nIT COULD MAKE THE DEHYDRATION WORSE, TYPICALLY ON A PLANE IT\nCOULD MAKE THINGS POTENTIALLY A LITTLE BIT WORSE.\nWHO KNOWS? I DON'T KNOW THE SEVERITY OF THE\nPNEUMONIA. DR. BARDEK SAYS SHE IS\nRECOVERING NICELY NOW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS,\nSHE CLEARLY HAD AN EPISODE TODAY AND HAD THIS DIAGNOSIS ON\nFRIDAY, ON MEDICATIONS, A NEW ONE WE'RE JUST LEARNING ABOUT\nRIGHT NOW. AN ANTIBIOTIC.\nSO THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS GOING ON PAINTING A BETTER\nPICTURE BUT STILL NOT A COMPLETE PICTURE.\n>> AND SANJAY, STAY WITH US, AS WE BRING IN OUR REPORTER OUTSIDE\nHILLARY CLINTON'S APARTMENT, WHERE SHE WENT TODAY AFTER SHE\nSTUMBLED AND GOT INTO THE VAN. I WANT TO BRING THE VIDEO\nGETTING INTO THE VAN BUT ALSO WALKING OUT OF CHELSEA CLINTON'S\nAPARTMENT. BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT\nTO SHOW HOW SHE WAS REACTING WHEN SHE CAME OUT OF THE VAN.\nARE THEY RESPONDING REGARDING THE STATEMENT FROM THE DOCTOR?\n>> Reporter: NOT QUITE YET. WE HAVE NOT HEARD FROM CLINTON'S\nCAMPAIGN AS TO WHETHER HER TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS WILL BE\nCHANGED. AS A RESULT OF THIS DOCTOR'S\nNOTE, THEY HAVE NOT -- CERTAINLY NOT REACTED TO THE NEW\nINFORMATION THAT WE'RE GETTING FROM HER LONG-TIME PHYSICIAN.\nI THINK AS SANJAY SAID THIS IS LIMITED INFORMATION STILL WE ARE\nDEALING WITH. BUT CERTAINLY VERY NEW\nINFORMATION WE'RE GETTING THAT SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA\nON FRIDAY. I FIND THAT VERY INTERESTING,\nBECAUSE RIGHT NOW TODAY IS SUNDAY.\nWE DID NOT KNOW MEMBERS OF THE PRESS, THE CAMPAIGN DID NOT\nINFORM ANYBODY THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS GOING ON, ON\nFRIDAY SHE HAD A BUSY SCHEDULE. SHE HAD A BIG NATIONAL SECURITY\nMEETING AND THEN HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE.\nAND IT IS ACTUALLY INTERESTING THINKING BACK TO THAT FRIDAY.\nI WAS IN THE ROOM WHEN SHE HELD THE PRESS CONFERENCE.\nAND I REMEMBER THINKING YOU COULD TELL SHE WAS STRUGGLING TO\nCONTAIN A COUGH. YOU COULD TELL HER THROAT WAS\nCLEARLY BOTHERING HER. YOU KNOW THAT IN RECENT WEEKS\nSHE HAS HAD THESE COUGHING FITS OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\nAND THEN WHEN SHE WAS DONE WITH THE PRESS CONFERENCE SHE LET OUT\nA BIG COUGH WHEN SHE WALKED AWAY FROM THE PODIUM.\nTHIS IS SOMETHING THE REPORTERS WERE TALKING ABOUT A LITTLE BIT\nAFTERWARDS AND JUST NOTING SOMETHING THAT WAS GOING ON.\nSO VERY INTERESTING SHE KNEW ABOUT THIS SINCE FRIDAY BUT\nCONTINUED ON -- PERHAPS THE DOCTOR'S DIAGNOSIS CAME AFTER\nTHAT PRESS CONFERENCE. WE DON'T REALLY KNOW.\nI THINK THE BIG QUESTION IS WHETHER THE CAMPAIGN WILL SORT\nOF TAKE THE ADVICE OF A DOCTOR P\nMORE SERIOUSLY. THE DOCTOR DID SAY IN THE LETTER\nSHE SHOULD REST AND MODIFY HER SCHEDULE.\nSHE IS SET TO GO TO CALIFORNIA TOMORROW, WE DON'T KNOW IF THE\nCAMPAIGN WILL CANCEL THAT OR DELAY THAT TRIP.\n>> AND M.J., YOU SAY IT IS INTERESTING WE'RE ONLY FINDING\nOUT NOW AND PERHAPS BECAUSE OF THIS EPISODE SHE WAS DIAGNOSED\nON FRIDAY. IS IT ATYPICAL FOR A CAMPAIGN TO\nNOT PUT THE INFORMATION OUT THERE RIGHT WHEN THEY LEARN\nABOUT THE DIAGNOSIS OR IS THAT STANDARD?\n>> Reporter: LOOK, CERTAINLY I CAN SAY THERE WERE MANY\nQUESTIONS SWIRLING ABOUT HER HEALTH, IN LARGE PART BECAUSE\nHER OPPONENT, DONALD TRUMP, AND HIS SURROGATES HAVE RAISED MANY\nQUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT SHE IS IN A GOOD STATE OF\nHEALTH. I THINK THIS IS A VERY SENSITIVE\nSUBJECT, SOMETHING THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS TRIED VERY HARD TO\nBRUSH AWAY. AND CERTAINLY THIS MORNING THAT\nWAS THE WORSE CASE SCENARIO WHERE YOU GET VIDEO OF HER\nSTUMBLING. LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS SAYING\nSHE APPEARED TO FAINT. THAT IS NOT THE KIND OF\nDISTRACTION THEY WANTED, ESPECIALLY THE KIND OF\nDISTRACTION RELATED TO HER HEALTH.\n>> ALL RIGHT, PLEASE STAY WITH ME.\nI WANT TO BRING IN DAN MERRICK, OUTSIDE OF CHAPPAQUA, OUTSIDE\nHER HOME, WE KNOW HILLARY CLINTON LEFT HER DAUGHTER,\nCHELSEA'S APARTMENT. AND DAN WHAT ARE YOU SEEING\nTHERE? WHAT IS THE MOOD SINCE HILLARY\nCLINTON ARRIVED THERE EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON.\n>> HEY, POPPY, WE HAVE NOT, IT IS PRETTY MUCH BUSINESS AS\nUSUAL, THE SECRET SERVICE BLOCKING THE AREA WHERE SHE\nLIVES. WE HAVEN'T SEEN HER COME OUT.\nSHE REPORTS SHE ARRIVED AT SOME TIME IN THE 1:00 HOUR.\nHER WAS WAITING FOR HER THERE AND CAME TO THE HOUSE TO EXAMINE\nHER THERE AFTER SHE HAD THIS INCIDENT LEAVING THE 9/11\nMEMORIAL. IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW AS M.J.\nSAID, THE DOCTOR SUGGESTED SHE MODIFY HER SCHEDULE.\nSHE AND HER PRESS CORPS ARE SUPPOSED TO FLY TO CALIFORNIA\nTOMORROW MORNING. AND THEN THERE IS A FUNDRAISER\nIN CALIFORNIA AND IN SAN FRANCISCO, AND THEN SHE HAS TWO\nFUNDRAISERS ON TUESDAY AS WELL AS AN EVENT IN THE LOS ANGELES\nAREA. AND THEN WEDNESDAY SHE IS\nSUPPOSED TO GIVE THE SPEECH AND CAMPAIGN MORE IN NEVADA IN LAS\nVEGAS. I'M TOLD THAT THE CAMPAIGN IS\nTAKING THE DOCTOR'S RECOMMENDATION SERIOUSLY.\nAND TAKE THE DIAGNOSIS OF PNEUMONIA SERIOUSLY.\nBUT AS OF NOW THERE IS NO CHANGE TO HER SCHEDULE.\nSHE IS STILL SLATED TO GO AND FLY TO L.A. TOMORROW.\nAND AS FOR HOW THE CAMPAIGN FEELS THEY KNOW THAT THIS IS YOU\nKNOW, LIKELY SOMETHING THAT TRUMP SUPPORTERS AND TRUMP MAYBE\nHIMSELF WILL USE TO POINT OUT SECRETARY CLINTON'S HEALTH,\nQUESTIONS ABOUT HER HEALTH. THEY CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN DOING\nTHAT. AND THE ISSUE WITH THE VIDEO IS\nTHAT QUESTIONS ABOUT HER HEALTH HAVE BEEN LIVING IN THE RIGHT\nWING NEWS SPHERE FOR A WHILE NOW.\nIT'S THE QUESTION SECRETARY CLINTON HAD TO WEIGH IN A FEW\nWEEKS FROM CLINTON'S DOCTOR. AND THE EVENTS FROM GROUND ZERO,\nIT WILL JUST ELEVATE AND MAKE IT MORE OF A MAINSTREAM\nCONVERSATION. >> AND DOUGLAS BRINKLEY, THE\nPRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN, JUST SAID TO ME EARLIER IN THE HOUR,\nSAID LOOK, IT COULD BE A PROBLEM IF SHE DOESN'T GET ON THE PLANE\nTOMORROW BUT HEALTH IS PRIMARY. I MEAN, THAT IS IT, RIGHT?\nDO YOU HAVE ANY INSIGHT INTO HOW",

WE BRING IN OUR POLITICAL PANEL\nTO DISCUSS TODAY'S DEVELOPMENTS. LARRY SABATEAU FROM THE\nUNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, JOSH ROGEN, COLUMNIST FOR \"THE\nWASHINGTON POST.\" JOSH SHE CERTAINLY LOOKED FINE\nWHEN SHE LEFT CHELSEA CLINTON'S APARTMENT IN NEW YORK CITY, SHE\nWAS SMILING, WAVING, SAID SHE FELT GREAT, BUT THIS DOES RAISE\nQUESTIONS ABOUT HER HEALTH. HOW SHOULD SHE AND HER CAMPAIGN\nADDRESS THIS? >> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.\nWE JUST DON'T HAVE ANY EVIDENCE THIS IS A SERIOUS HEALTH\nINCIDENT IN AND OF ITSELF. WE DON'T HAVE THE FACTS, BUT THE\nIMPLICATION OF THIS IS CLEAR. LAST WEEK IN NEWSROOMS ALL OVER\nTHE COUNTRY EDITORS AND COLUMN IS AND REPORTERS WERE THINKING\nWHAT SHOULD WE DO ABOUT THE GROWING CONSPIRACY THEORIES,\nMENTIONS OF THE INTERNATIONAL ON THE HEALTH.\nNOW THE STORY IS MAINSTREAMED. THIS WILL BE PART OF THE DEBATE.\nIT WILL BE PART OF THE ELECTION AND IT WILL BE PART OF OUR\nPOLITICS FOR THE NEXT 58 DAYS OR WHATEVER.\nSO WHAT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS TO DO IS INTERNALIZE THAT, AND\nDEAL WITH IT, AND DEAL WITH IT AS UP FRONT AND AS\nTRANSPARENTALLY AS THEY CAN. IN 2012 SHE MADE THIS MISTAKE.\nSHE HAD THESE HEALTH PROBLEMS, SHE WAS COY ABOUT IT, THEY A\nAVOIDED TALKING ABOUT THE FACTS. TOOK THEM THREE YEARS TO TALK\nABOUT IT. THEY CAN'T DO THAT, DON'T HAVE\nTHAT TIME SO THEY HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT THIS IS NOW A THING AND\nTHEY HAVE TO TRY TO MINIMIZE THE DAMAGE.\n>> I ASSUME LARRY YOU AGREE THOSE CONSPIRACY THEORIES OUT\nTHERE IS NOW GOING TO ESCALATE PRETTY DRAMATICALLY.\nHOW DO YOU THINK THE CAMPAIGN AND HILLARY CLINTON AND HER\nPHYSICIAN FOR EXAMPLE WHAT DO THEY NEED TO DO?\n>> WELL THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN NEEDS TO RELEASE ANY AND ALL\nINFORMATION ABOUT HER HEALTH. WE REALLY HAVEN'T GOTTEN VERY\nMUCH, ESSENTIALLY A LETTER FROM HER DOCTOR ALTHOUGH TO BE FAIR,\nWOLF, IT CONTAINED MORE INFORMATION THAN THAT SILLY\nRIDICULOUS LETTER FROM DONALD TRUMP'S DOCTOR DECLARING HE\nWOULD BE THE HEALTHIEST PERSON EVER TO OCCUPY THE OVAL OFFICE,\nWITH NO PROOF. YOU HAVE TO APPLY THE SAME\nSTANDARDS TO BOTH SIDES. ALSO, IF THERE'S NO RECURRENCE,\nI DON'T KNOW THAT THIS IS A MAJOR TOPIC, EXCEPT ON SOCIAL\nMEDIA, AND YOU WILL NEVER CONTROL THE CONSPIRACY\nTHEORISTS. THEY'VE BEEN SPREADING THIS FOR\nMONTHS. >> BUT WITH THE INCIDENT TODAY\nAND THE VIDEO, THE VIDEO THAT WE SAW SHE STUMBLED GETTING INTO\nTHE CAR AS JOSH SAYS, LARRY, IT WILL BE MORE MAINSTREAMED NOW.\nPEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE ANXIOUS TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT, AND\nTHE CAMPAIGN IS GOING TO HAVE TO HELP US APPRECIATE WHAT\nHAPPENED. >> WELL, I AGREE WITH THAT.\nTHEY NEED TO RELEASE, AS I SAID, ALL INFORMATION THAT THEY HAVE.\nI THINK HER DOCTOR NEEDS TO ISSUE A STATEMENT ABOUT IT.\nYOU KNOW, SOMETIMES PEOPLE ACTUALLY DO FAINT WHEN IT'S\nREALLY HOT AND I'VE DONE IT MYSELF.\nPEOPLE PERFECTLY HEALTHY CAN FAINT IN THIS BAY.\nI'M NOT SAYING THERE'S NOTHING ELSE THERE, I DON'T KNOW, BUT I\nTHINK TOO MUCH IS BEING MADE OF IT UNTIL WE HAVE MORE FACTS.\n>> AND JOSH, HOPEFULLY WE'RE GOING TO GET MORE FACTS FROM THE\nCAMPAIGN, HOPEFULLY HILLARY CLINTON WILL ANSWER REPORTERS'\nQUESTIONS AND HOPEFULLY ISSUE A STATEMENT OR ANSWER SOME\nQUESTIONS AS WELL, BUT SO FAR IT'S ALL UP IN THE AIR AND A LOT\nOF US ARE WONDERING WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.\nFUND-RAISING CAMPAIGN TRIPS ON THE WEST COAST, AS OF NOW SHE'S\nSTILL GOING TO GO, ALTHOUGH YOU HEARD DR. SANJAY GUPTA SAY MAYBE\nOUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION SHE SHOULD GET AN EKG, A FULL\nTEST TO MAKE SURE THERE IS NOTHING THERE.\n>> RIGHT, THE EARLY INDICATIONS ARE NOT THAT THE CAMPAIGN IS\nGOING TO BE OPEN AND TRANSPARENT WITH THE PRESS.\nTHE WAY THEY'VE HANDLED THIS TODAY HAS BEEN FLAWED A LOT OF\nPEOPLE ON CNN NOTED THAT THE ACCESS AND THE INFORMATION HAS\nNOT BEEN FORTHCOMING. I'M SURE THEY'RE TRYING TO\nFIGURE IT OUT NOW. I THINK EVERYONE WOULD AGREE\nTHAT HILLARY CLINTON SHOULD DO WHATEVER SHE NEEDS TO DO TO MAKE\nSURE THAT SHE'S HEALTHY AND CONTINUE THIS RIGOROUS GRUELING\nSCHEDULE. MAYBE SHE GO AHEAD AND DO THAT.\nTHEISH ISSUE IS SHE GOING TO BE HONEST AND OPEN AND TRANSPARENT\nWITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHAT'S GOING ON AND HOW MUCH THEY KNOW\nAND DON'T KNOW. >> WHAT DO YOU ANTICIPATE LARRY\nTHE REACTION FROM THE DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN WILL BE?\nSO FAR THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY REAL REACTION PROBABLY BECAUSE\nTHIS IS THE MEMORIAL OF 9/11, 15th ANNIVERSARY OF 9/11 ON THIS\nDAY, MAYBE THEY'RE WAITING? >> WOLF, DOES ANYONE DOUBT THAT\nDONALD TRUMP WILL REFER TO THIS IN A DEROGATORY WAY SOONER OR\nLATER IN A RALLY OR SOME OTHER CAMPAIGN GATHERING?\nOF COURSE HE WILL. THAT'S I'M SURE TO BE EXPECTED\nAND THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN KNOWS TO EXPECT IT AND THAT'S WHY THEY\nSHOULD GET OUT AS MUCH INFORMATION AS THEY CAN, AS\nQUICKLY AS THEY CAN, AND TRY TO PUT IT TO REST.\nIT WILL BE PUT TO REST, AS LONG AS THERE ISN'T A RECURRENCE.\n>> THEY SHOULD PUT, I ASSUME YOU WANT NOT ONLY THE HILLARY\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN TO RELEASE ALL OF HER MEDICAL INFORMATION AND\nDONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN TO RELEASE HIS MEDICAL INFORMATION AS WELL.\nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE ELECTING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES AND DESERVE TO KNOW THE HEALTH OF THESE TWO CANDIDATES.\n>> THAT'S ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE HAD SOME\nCASES IN AMERICAN HISTORY WHERE THE PUBLIC HAS NOT RECEIVED THE\nINFORMATION IT DESERVED TO HEAR BEFORE ELECTION DAY ABOUT THE\nPRESIDENT'S HEALTH OR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE'S HEALTH.\nWE DON'T WANT A RECURRENCE OF THAT BUT I'M GLAD YOU MENTIONED\nDONALD TRUMP. THIS HAS TO BE FAIR.\nNEITHER CAMPAIGN HAS RELEASED FULL HEALTH RECORDS.\nTHEY BOTH NEED TO DO SO. >> HILLARY'S CAMPAIGN, HILLARY\nCLINTON'S CAMPAIGN HAS RELEASED MORE INFORMATION ABOUT HER\nHEALTH THAN DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN RELEASED ABOUT HIS\nHEALTH. JOSH, YOU AGREE, RIGHT?\n>> YES, THEY HAVE RELEASED MORE. THEY HAVE MORE TRANSPARENT THAN\nDONALD TRUMP BUT THEY ALSO NOW HAVE A VIRAL VIDEO OF HER\nSTUMBLING AS SHE TRIED TO GET INTO THE CAR.\nSO THESE TWO THINGS ARE BOTH TRUE AND THESE THINGS ARE NOT\nGOING AWAY. OKAY, SO IT'S MORE OF AN ISSUE\nFOR HER. THAT'S NOT FAIR OR RIGHT.\nTHAT'S POLITICS AND PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS AND WHAT I'M SAYING\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS TO GET OUT IN FRONT OF.\nHOW THIS PLAYS OUT OVER THE NEXT 58 DAYS IS NOT YET DETERMINED.\nIT COULD GO EITHER WAY DEPENDING HOW THE CLINTON TEAM HANDLES IT\nAND HOW HEALTHY SHE IS. ONE OF THE THINGS THEY HAVE\nCONTROL OVER, ONE OF THE THINGS THEY DON'T.\n>> JOSH AND LARRY, GUYS, THANKS VERY MUCH.\nWE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE OUR COVERAGE RIGHT AFTER A QUICK\nBREAK.",

THEN WE DIDN'T ROLL THE TAPE AT\nTHE BEGINNING, BUT SHE IS WALKS OUT OF THE APARTMENT.\nCOME OVER HERE AND TELL US WHAT HAPPENED.\nSHE SAYS IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY IN NEW YORK AND WALKS AWAY FROM\nTHEM.

LET ME BEGIN THIS HOUR WITH OUR\nCHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT DR. SANJAY GUPTA.\nWHAT WE KNOW AT THIS HOUR, NOT A LOT OF DETAILS.\nWE KNOW FROM HER TEAM SHE OVERHEATED THIS MORNING.\nAN WE KNOW FROM HER DOCTOR NOW SAYING THAT WAS DIAGNOSED WITH\nPNEUMONIA ON FRIDAY. INTERESTINGLY, THOUGH, THEY\nDIDN'T TELL THE PUBLIC OR THE PRESS ABOUT THIS PNEUMONIA\nDIAGNOSE. WE JUST FOUND OUT ABOUT IT NOW.\nWHAT DO YOU MAKE OF ALL THIS? >> WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S EXACTLY\nAS YOU SAID, WE'RE STILL GETTING BITS OF INFORMATION.\nIT'S COMING IN SPORADICALLY TRYING TO PIECE IT TOGETHER.\nALL SORT OF STIMULATED BY THE VIDEO OF HER HAVING DIFFICULTY\nGETTING INTO THE VAN AND HAVING DIFFICULTY HOLDING HERSELF UP\nWITH HER BALANCE. YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT IN\nMEDICINE, COMMON THINGS ARE COMMON.\nSO THE IDEA THAT SOMEONE IS FEELING OUT OF SORTS,\nUNBALANCED, AS HAVING A DIFFICULTY WALKING, GETTING INTO\nTHE VAN, LIKE WE SEE IN THIS VIDEO COULD BE EXPLAINED AS\nSOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS DEHYDRATED.\nWHEN YOU BECOME PROFOUNDLY DEHYDRATED, YOU DROP YOUR BLOOD\nPRESSURE, YOU DON'T FEEL WELL. IT'S HARD TO GET AROUND AND HAVE\nTHESE SORTS OF PROBLEMS. WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT FIRST\nWE HEAR SHE WAS OVERHEATED AND THAT'S SORT OF WHAT CAUSED THESE\nSYMPTOMS. THEN JUST RECENTLY WE HEAR THAT\nSHE HAS PNEUMONIA, AND IT SOUNDS LIKE BACTERIAL PNEUMONIA AND IT\nWAS DIAGNOSED TWO DAYS AGO. SHE'S BEEN POWERING THROUGH THE\nSCHEDULE JUST TRYING TO MAKE IT WORK WITH PNEUMONIA OR EVEN\nAGAINST THE ADVICE OF THE DOCTOR WHO SAID, YOU NEED TO GET REST,\nYOU NEED TO BE REHYDRATED. WE'RE HEARING BITS AND PIECES OF\nINFORMATION BUT STILL TRYING TO PIECE IT ALL TOGETHER, POPE. >>.\n>> DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO YOU WITH THIS PNEUMONIA DIAGNOSIS\nTHAT SHE'D GO OUT IN PUBLIC SO MUCH, GO TO THIS 9/11 CEREMONY,\nTHEN GO OVER TO CHELSEA'S APARTMENT AFTER SHE HAD THAT\nSTUMBLE GETTING INTO THE VAN. WE CAN PULL THAT UP AND SHOW YOU\nTHAT AS WELL, THIS MORNING HAVING TO LEAVE THIS CEREMONY\nEARLY. AND HER TEAM SAID THAT SHE\nPLAYED WITH HER GRANDCHILDREN AT THE APARTMENT.\nI MEAN, WITH PNEUMONIA, IS IT CONTAGIOUS?\nDOES THAT ALL MAKE SENSE TO YOU? >> WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S -- NOT\nEVERY BIT OF IT MAKES SENSE OR NOT EVERY BIT OF IT SEEMS TO\nFIT, BUT IT'S ALL POSSIBLE. YOU KNOW, BACTERIAL PNEUMONIA,\nTHERE ARE VARIETIES OF IT DEPENDING ON WHAT TYPE IT IS,\nSOME ARE MORE CONTAGIOUS THAN OTHERS.\nWHEN SOMEONE HAS STARTED THERAPY WITH ANTIBIOTICS, YOU CAN REDUCE\nYOUR CONTAGIOUSLY. YOUR DOCTOR PROBABLY WOULD SAY\nYOU SHOULDN'T PLAY WITH YOUNG CHILDREN, YOU MIGHT PUT THEM AT\nMORE RISK. WE DON'T KNOW HOW SERIOUS THIS\nIS, DOES IT INVOLVE THE ENTIRE LUNG OR A SINGLE LOBE.\nWE DON'T KNOW HOW IT WAS DIAGNOSED?\nTHAT WOULD BE TYPICAL TO GET A CHEST X-RAY.\nYOU GET BLOODWORK. SO AGAIN THERE'S A LOT OF\nUNKNOWNS HERE STILL. I THINK THE IDEA THAT SHE WAS\nPLAYING WITH THE GRANDCHILDREN IS ANOTHER QUESTION MARK.\nBUT IT'S ALL POSSIBLE THAT IT COULD FIT, BUT WE DON'T HAVE ALL\nTHE PIECES TO MAKE IT ALL FIT TOGETHER.\n>> YOU KNOW, THE CONTEXT THAT THIS COMES IN, SANJAY, IS THE\nCONTEXT OF SOME BIG TRUMP SURROGATES AND TRUMP HIMSELF\nSORT OF QUESTIONING HER HEALTH, HER PHYSICAL CAPACITY TO BE\nPRESIDENT, AND A LOT OF THESE QUESTIONS ARE NOT GROUNDED IN\nANY FACT, BUT THE REALITY IS THAT WE DO NOT HAVE THE HEALTH\nRECORDS OF SECRETARY CLINTON OR DONALD TRUMP IN ALL OF THIS.\nDOES THIS REALLY DRIVE HOME THE POINT THAT PERHAPS BOTH OF THEM\nSHOULD RELEASE THEIR MEDICAL RECORDS IN TOTALITY?\n>> I THINK SO. YOU KNOW, LOOK, I'VE BEEN\nREPORTING ON THIS SORT OF ISSUE FOR A LONG TIME, SEVERAL\nELECTIONS. WE'RE NOT HEARING MUCH FROM\nEITHER CANDIDATE. THE CANDIDATE IN TERMS OF THEIR\nHEALTH, WE'VE GOT THESE SUMMARIES OF THEIR HEALTH\nOVERALL. GIVEN, YOU KNOW, I THINK AN\nEPISODE LIKE THIS, THERE MIGHT BE MORE OF A PUSH TO GET THE\nHEALTH RECORDS. I'M NOT SURE WE'RE GOING TO SEE\nTHEM, ESPECIALLY NOT THIS CLOSE TO THE ELECTION.\nBUT WHETHER WE'RE",

LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS WITH\nREBECCA BERG, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST AND RYAN LIZ ZHA, CNN\nPOLITICAL COMMENTATOR. REBECCA, YOU OBVIOUSLY ARE\nANTICIPATING, ALL OF US ANTICIPATING LOTS OF QUESTIONS\nRAISED ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH, FAIR OR NOT.\nTHE ISSUE IS CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO GO AWAY.\nHOW SHOULD HER CAMPAIGN HANDLE THIS?\n>> WELL, I THINK, WOLF, THE BEST WAY FOR HER CAMPAIGN TO HANDLE\nTHIS WOULD BE IN THE WAY THEY HAVEN'T HANDLED QUESTIONS LIKE\nTHIS SO FAR, AND THAT'S WITH THE UTMOST TRANSPARENCY.\nHILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP, I SHOULD NOTE, HAVE NOT\nRELEASED THEIR FULL HEALTH RECORDS WHICH HAS BEEN AN\nONGOING QUESTION IN THIS CAMPAIGN, AND REALLY, THROUGHOUT\nTHE DAY, THEY HAVE NOT BEEN GIVING THE PRESS ANY SORT OF\nCONSTANT UPDATES. IT TOOK THEM I THINK 90 MINUTES\nBETWEEN HILLARY CLINTON LEAVING THE 9/11 MEMORIAL, AND BEFORE\nTHEY WERE ABLE TO GIVE THE PRESS ANY SORT OF INDICATION AS TO HER\nWHEREABOUTS OR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND EVEN NOW WE DON'T KNOW IF\nSHE HAS MET WITH A DOCTOR, WHAT SORT OF TEST SHE'S GOING\nTHROUGH, IF ANY, WHAT SHE'S DOING AT HER HOME IN CHAPPAQUA\n. AT THIS STAGE BE TRANSPARENT AND\nTELL PEOPLE WHAT'S GOING ON. THE QUESTION WILL BE ON VOTERS'\nMINDS AND TOPIC OF CONVERSATION. >> THE HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN\nRELEASED MORE DETAILS ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH AND THE\nDONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN RELEASED ABOUT HIS HEALTH.\nTHEY'RE BOTH APPROXIMATELY THE SAME AGE, SHE'S WHAT, 69 YEARS\nOLD. HE'S 70 YEARS OLD.\nRYAN, THIS IS GOING TO FUEL THE CONSPIRACY THEORIES OUT THERE\nOVER THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS THAT SHE'S NOT IN GOOD HEALTH.\n>> YES, AND YOU KNOW, I AGREE WITH JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING\nREBECCA JUST SAID. MOST OF THE CONSPIRACY, THESE\nCONSPIRACY THEORIES ARE JUST THAT, THEY'RE CONSPIRACY\nTHEORIES, THERE'S ONE FLOATING AROUND BASED ON A VIDEO OF\nCLINTON JOKING AROUND AND SO NOTHING THAT ANYONE SHOULD HAVE\nTAKEN SERIOUSLY, BUT NOW SHE'S PUBLICLY HAD A BIT OF AN ISSUE\nHERE, AND TRANSPARENCY IS THE KEY HERE.\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN DIDN'T DO SO WELL TODAY, FRANKLY.\nTHEY DIDN'T ALLOW THE TRAVELING PRESS POOL TO LEAVE WITH HER.\nTHERE WAS RADIO SILENCE FROM THE CAMPAIGN WHEN SHE LEFT THE 9/11\nMEMORIAL THIS MORNING, AND FRANKLY, THE PRESS DIDN'T KNOW\nSHE WAS GONE, AND SO LOOK, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO BE SOMEWHAT\nUNDERSTANDING IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS, IT'S HARD TO GET\nINFORMATION TO THE PRESS, BUT THIS IS NOW GOING TO BE A PRETTY\nSIGNIFICANT ISSUE, AND GOING FORWARD, WHAT THEY NEED TO DO IS\nEXPLAIN EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED, WHAT HER PHYSICIANS BELIEVE\nHAPPENED HERE, AND MAKE SURE THAT THE PUBLIC KNOWS THAT\nTHERE'S NOTHING MORE SERIOUS, BECAUSE I CAN GUARANTEE YOU,\nTHAT DONALD TRUMP AND HIS SURROGATES WILL MAKE AN ISSUE OF\nTHIS. THEY MADE AN ISSUE OF HER HEALTH\nWHEN THERE WAS NO REASON FOR CONCERN, NOW THAT THERE IS\nSOMETHING PUBLICLY CONCERNING, IT WILL BE A TOP ISSUE AND\nTRANSPARENCY IS THE KEY FOR THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IF THEY WANT\nTO, AND THEY NEED TO MAKE SURE THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS WHAT\nHAPPENED. >> WELL, I'VE SPOKEN TO SOME\nPEOPLE, REBECCA, WHO SAY THE BEST THING FOR HER TO DO IS DO A\nLITTLE NEWS CONFERENCE, EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED IN HER OWN WORDS\nBUT ALSO AT THE SAME TIME INVITE HER PHYSICIAN TO JOIN THE\nCONVERSATION AND ANSWER REPORTERS QUESTIONS AND GIVE A\nPRECISE ACCOUNTING OF WHAT HAPPENED, WHICH MAY BE NOT THAT\nKIG SIGG CANT, COULD BE SIGNIFICANT.\nMAYBE THAT WOULD BE THE BEST WAY TO SHOW PRESUMABLY SHE'S OKAY.\n>> SURE, I THINK THAT WOULD BE A GREAT IDEA, WOLF.\nI THINK SHE AND HER CAMPAIGN COULD CERTAINLY POINT OUT THAT\nCANDIDATES FOR PRESIDENT, VICE PRESIDENT HAVE DEALT WITH HEALTH\nISSUES BEFORE. I MEAN, USUALLY THE NORM IS NOT\nFOR SOMEONE IN THEIR 30s OR 40s TO BE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.\nTHE NORM IS FOR PEOPLE MUCH OLDER THAN THAT TO BE RUNNING SO\nYOU'RE GOING TO HAVE HAD HEALTH ISSUES OVER THE COURSE OF YOUR\nLIFETIME. DICK CHENEY DECIDED IN 1996 NOT TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT\nBECAUSE HE WAS WORRIED HIS PAST HEART ATTACKS WOULD BE A\nCAMPAIGN ISSUE. HE RAN IN 2000 WITH VERY FEW\nQUESTIONS ASKED ABOUT HIS HEART HEALTH, DURING THE FLORIDA\nRECOUNT HE HAD A FOURTH HEART ATTACK OF HIS LIFETIME, BUT\nSTILL DOING FINE TODAY. AND SO SHE COULD VERY WELL POINT\nOUT THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN IN THIS POSITION BEFORE, HAVE BEEN\nABLE TO FULFILL THEIR OFFICES. GEORGE W. BUSH FAINTED WHEN HE\nWAS PRESIDENTED, AND THAT WAS AN ISSUE FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF\nTIME, AND HE CAME FORWARD AND JUST EXPLAINED WHAT HAD\nHAPPENED. HE SAID AND THIS IS A GREAT\nGEORGE W. BUSH CLASSIC QUOTE \"I HIT THE DECKS.\"\nHE TOLD PEOPLE WHAT HAPPENED AND PEOPLE MOVED ON SO I THINK THAT\nWOULD BE THE VERY WISE COURSE OF ACTION FOR HILLARY CLINTON IN\nTHIS CASE AS WELL. >> AND RYAN, YOU HEARD OUR CHIEF\nMEDICAL CORRESPONDENT DR. SANJAY GUPTA, WHO IS A NEUROSURGEON, AN\nEXPERT IN THESE KINDS OF AREAS, HE DID SAY PRECISELY THAT, YOU\nKNOW WHAT? MAYBE OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF\nCAUTION, SHE SHOULD HAVE A COMPLETE CHECKUP RIGHT NOW TO\nMAKE SURE FOR EXAMPLE IT'S NOT AT ALL CONNECTED TO WHAT\nHAPPENED AT THE END OF 2012, WHICH SHE FAINTED, HIT HER HEAD,\nHAD A CONCUSSION AND AS A RESULT SHE HAD A BLOOD CLOT BETWEEN HER\nBRAIN AND HER SKULL AND SHE'S BEEN TAKING SOME BLOOD THINNERS\nEVER SINCE. I THINK OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF\nCAUTION YOU'RE SAYING MAYBE SHE SHOULD DELAY HER TRIP TO\nCALIFORNIA TOMORROW AND HAVE A COMPLETE CHECKUP.\n>> YES, OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT\nFOR US AS POLITICAL COMMENTATORS NO THE TO PLAY DOCTOR AND THINK\nWE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED HERE.\nI NOTICED THAT SANJAY WAS VERY CAREFUL IN NOT DOING SOME\nDIAGNOSIS FROM AFAR. THIS COULD BE NOTHING OR\nSOMETHING SERIOUS. WE DON'T KNOW FROM A GRAINY\nVIDEO AT A DISTANCE. AS REBECCA POINTED OUT GEORGE\nH.W. BUSH FAINTED WHEN HE WAS IN PUBLIC IN JAPAN IN THE LATE\n'80s, EARLY '90s AND GEORGE W. BUSH CHOKED ON A PRETZEL IN THE\nWHITE HOUSE, PASSED OUT AND GOT A BUMP ON HIS HEAD, BOTH\nINCIDENTS CAUSED GREAT PUBLIC CONCERN AND TURNED OUT TO BE\nNOTHING IN THE END SO AGAIN, IT GOES BACK TO THIS ISSUE OF\nTRANSPARENCY, YOU KNOW, RIGHT NOW WE HAVE SCANT DETAILS, WE'RE\nSPECULATING ABOUT HER INCIDENT IN 2012, WHEN SHE HAD A\nCONCUSSION AND BLOOD CLOT. HER HUSBAND, AFTER THAT\nHAPPENED, HE PUBLICLY SAID, BILL CLINTON PUBLICLY SAID IT TOOK\nABOUT SIX MONTHS OF SERIOUS WORK TO GET OVER THAT CONCUSSION.\nIT WAS NO SMALL THING, SO WE WOULD OBVIOUSLY WANT TO KNOW IF\nIT'S ANYTHING RELATED, IF THIS IS RELATED TO THAT OR AS SOME\nREPORTS ARE SUGGESTING, IF IT'S RELATED TO HER ALLERGIES.\nSHE HAS HAD SOME ISSUES WITH ALLERGIES ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL\nRECENTLY. WE DON'T KNOW.\nTHAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT THEY NEED TO COME OUT VERY\nCLEARLY WITH MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS AND JUST EXPLAIN\nEXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED HERE. THAT'S THE BEST WAY FOR THEM TO\nGO FORWARD AND FOR US TO UNDERSTAND IT, BECAUSE THE WORST\nTHING IN THE WORLD WOULD BE FOR ISSUES LIKE THIS TO BE HANGING\nOVER THE CAMPAIGN AND IF SHE ENTERS THE WHITE HOUSE AND WE\nDON'T KNOW. WE DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO THE\nBAD OLD DAYS, WHERE WE HAD PRESIDENTS WHO ENTERED THE WHITE\nHOUSE WITH MEDICAL CONDITIONS THE PUBLIC DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT.\n>> GOOD ADVICE, RYAN LI AZZA THANKS, AND REBECCA BERG, STAY\nWITH US AS WELL. REMEMBER THE THICK GLASSES THAT\nHILLARY CLINTON WORE DURING THOSE SIX MONTHS OR SO WHEN SHE\nWAS RECUPERATING FROM THE BLOOD CLOT.\nWE'LL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE BREAKING NEWS ON HILLARY\nCLINTON, WHAT THIS POTENTIAL COULD MEAN FOR HER CAMPAIGN.\nMUCH MORE OF THE NEWS. STAY WITH US.\nWE'LL TAKE A QUICK BREAK.",

THE INFORMATION REVOLUTION WAS\nJUST TAKING OFF. I TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO MY\nCHILDREN THAT ONLY TWO DECADES AGO, MUCH OF THE WORLD THAT\nSEEMS INDISPENSABLE TODAY, THE INTERNET, CELL PHONES, DID NOT\nEXIST FOR MOST PEOPLE. WHAT FEW OF US RECOGNIZED AT THE\nTIME WAS ONE PART OF THE WORLD WAS NOT BEING RESHAPED BY THE\nWINDS OF CHANGE, THE MIDDLE EAST.\nAS COMMUNISM CRUMBLED, LATIN AMERICA YIELDED APARTHEID\nCRACKED AND THEY GAVE WAY TO",

THAT WAS A MOMENT OF SILENCE\nCOMMEMORATING THE MOMENT WHEN THE PENTAGON WAS STRUCK IN\nWASHINGTON. I AM BACK WITH MY PANEL.\nAND ANDY CARD, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF FOR PRESIDENT GEORGE W.\nBUSH. WHEN YOU HEARD ABOUT THE\nPENTAGON BEING HIT, THAT MEANT THIS WAS A MULTI-CITY ATTACK AND\nWAS MAYBE NOT EVEN DONE. YOU WERE ON AIR FORCE ONE WITH\nPRESIDENT BUSH AT THE TIME? >> IT CONTINUED THE FOG OF WAR.\nI REMEMBER WE WERE IN THE LIMOUSINE DRIVING FROM THE\nSCHOOL IN SARASOTA TO AIR FORCE ONE, AND THE PRESIDENT AND I\nWERE SITTING IN THE BACK OF THE LIMOUSINE.\nHE IS FRUSTRATED BECAUSE HE IS TRYING TO REACH SECRETARY\nRUMSFELD. AND I AM ON MY CELLPHONE CALLING\nBACK TO D.C. AND HE SAID, I CAN'T GET THROUGH\nTO THE PENTAGON. IT TURNS OUT THAT'S WHEN THE\nPENTAGON HAD BEEN HIT. WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT HAD BEEN\nHIT. AND SO HE WAS JUST FRUSTRATED\nTHAT HE COULDN'T GET SECRETARY RUMSFELD.\nAND THEN WE GET ON PLANE, WE FIND OUT ABOUT THE PENTAGON\nBEING HIT, AND IT TOLD US THAT THIS WAS NOT JUST AN ATTACK ON\nNEW YORK CITY, THIS WAS GOING TO WAR, THIS WAS A REAL WAR, AND\nTHAT THE FOG OF WAR WAS REAL. WE WEREN'T GETTING GOOD\nINFORMATION AS QUICKLY AS WE WANTED TO GET IT.\nAND THE PRESIDENT -- I WAS VERY IMPRESSED -- IMMEDIATELY STARTED\nTHINKING ABOUT THE GREATER BURDENS.\nIT WASN'T TUNNEL VISION. HE IT TERRIFIC PERIPHERAL VISION\nABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING. HE SAID, I WANT TO TRACK DOWN\nPRESIDENT PUTIN AND CALL HIM AND MAKE SURE HE KNOWS WE'RE NOT\nGOING TO WAR AND THAT WE DON'T WANT THEM TO USE AN EXCUSE TO GO\nTO WAR WITH US. >> BECAUSE PRESIDENT BUSH WAS\nGOING TO RAISE THE MILITARY THREAT LEVEL AS TO WHAT WAS\nGOING ON. >> IT WAS BEING RAISED LITERALLY\nAS WE WERE SPEAKING. AND YES.\nBUT HE WAS JUST SAYING, THIS -- THERE IS A BIG CONSEQUENCE HERE\nIF PEOPLE MISCALCULATE. >> FARAJ, YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT\nHOW PRESIDENT BUSH, TO HIS CREDIT, WAS THINKING ABOUT OTHER\nRAMIFICATIONS AFTER THE ATTACK. >> THIS IS ABOUT A VIOLENT\nIDEOLOGY THAT CONTINUES TO MANIFEST.\nIT'S NOT JUST ABOUT ONE ATTACK HERE IN AMERICA.\nAS WE HAVE SEEN, WHETHER IT'S ATTACKS IN LONDON OR MADRID,\nBELGIUM, PARIS OR BOSTON, IT'S A GLOBAL THREAT.\nIN THE YEARS AFTER 9/11 YOU BEGAN TO SEE A CHANGE ABOUT HOW\nWE THOUGHT ABOUT THE IDEALOGICAL WHERE AND THE IMPACT.\nIT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT AQ WAS -- WE COULD IMAGINE\nIT THEN AS SOMETHING WE THOUGHT WE UNDERSTOOD BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE\nTHE IMAGINATION TO SEE THE EVENTS THAT WOULD TAKE PLACE\nAFTERWARDS. YOU NOW HAVE GROUPS LIKE ISIS\nAND OTHER GROUPS THAT ARE -- THAT RALLIED TO THE CALL OF AN\nUS AND THEM. ALL OF THESE THINGS WERE PUT IN\nPLACE IN THE YEARS AFTER, BUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING DURING THE\nBUSH ADMINISTRATION WAS, HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT THE RECRUITMENT\nPROCESS. HOW DO WE LOOK AT THE\nIDEALOGICAL WAR. WE WERE NOT AFRAID TO LOOK AT IT\nTHEN AND WE SHOULDN'T BE AFRAID TO LOOK AT IT NOW.\nTHE IMPACT OF HOW THIS IDEOLOGY HAS MANIFESTED.\nI REMEMBER TALKING TO SOMEONE IN TANZANIA.\nTHIS IS A MAN WHO HAD BEEN THROUGH THE ATTACKS IN 1998 --\n>> THE EMBASSY ATTACKS. >> YES.\nIN TANZANIA. HE SAID TO ME, DOESN'T YOUR\nCOUNTRY UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IDEOLOGY IS NOT JUST ABOUT WHAT\nHAPPENED IN '98 OR 2001, THAT WE ARE SEEING THIS ALL OVER THE\nWORLD. ARE YOU PREPARING FOR THAT.\nAND THAT REALLY STRUCK ME. AND I THINK WE HAVE TO -- THIS\nIS SUCH A SOBERING DAY. THIS IS A DAY OF REMEMBRANCE.\nAND WE HAVE TO REALLY THINK ABOUT WHERE WE WANT TO BE\n15 YEARS FROM NOW AND WHAT WE'RE DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT\nIDEOLOGY DOES NOT RECRUIT MORE CHILDREN FROM AROUND THE WORLD.\n>> AND MARY MATALIN. WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH WENT TO THE\nMOSQUE ON MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE HERE AND SAID ISLAM IS PEACE, IT\nWAS MOCKED BY A LOT OF CONSERVATIVES IN RETROSPECT AS\nBEING POLITICALLY CORRECT AND SQUISHY.\nBUT IT WAS ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT FARAH WAS TALKING ABOUT.\nSTRATEGY AND NOT WANTING MORE ATTACKS.\n>> RIGHT. BUT THERE WAS INTENTION IN\nSAYING ISLAM IS A RELIGION OF PEACE.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT WOULD -- WE ALL CENTERED SPEECHES AROUND,\nANDY'S OFFICE WOULD PUT IT IN AND HE WOULD TAKE IT OUT EVERY\nTIME BECAUSE WHETHER OR NOT THAT IS GENERALLY TRUE, ISLAMIC\nEXTREMISTS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, THIS IS NOT A MISSION OF\nPEACE. AND THERE WAS A LOT OF CRASH\nCOURSES, THE VICE PRESIDENT KNEW WHO IT WAS, ONLY A COUPLE OF\nDAYS BEFORE THAT THERE HAD BEEN A MURDER IN A CAVE IN\nAFGHANISTAN. SO THERE WAS A FAMILIARITY\nTHERE. BUT FOR THE REST OF US, WE\nBROUGHT IN BERNARD LEWIS, MILITARY STRATEGISTS.\nI DARE SAY AN INFINITESIMAL PERCENT OF AMERICANS KNEW WHAT A\nCALIPHATE WAS AT THE TIME. >> ABSOLUTELY.\n>> IT WAS A VERY BIG LEARNING EXPERIENCE.\nIT WASN'T THAT WE HAD AN IMMEDIATE IDEALOGICAL PROBLEM\nWITH CONSERVATIVES OR HOW WE THINK OF POLITICS TODAY.\nIT WAS HOW DO WE GO AFTER THIS THREAT.\nAND WE WEREN'T AS CONCERNED, WE DIDN'T NEED TO BE CONCERNED\nBECAUSE THERE WASN'T A POLITICIZATION OF IDENTITY\nPOLITICS AT THE TIME. >> BUT THERE WAS A BATTLEFIELD\nWHERE THAT WE WERE STANDING UP. THERE WAS AN IDEALOGICAL WAR\nTHAT WE WERE PREPARING FOR. THE SEPARATION OF BOTH OF THEM\nIS SOMETHING WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT AS WE THINK THROUGH WHAT\nWE DO NEXT. I DON'T THINK WE'VE STOOD UP THE\nIDEALOGICAL COMPONENT AS FIERCELY AS WE SHOULD HAVE AND\nCOULD HAVE. WHEN I THINK ABOUT WHAT MARY\nJUST SAID ABOUT TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE -- THE\nGREATEST STRENGTH OF OUR COUNTRY IS THE DIVERSITY.\nTHE GREATEST STRENGTH VIS-A-VIS MUSLIMS IS THAT WE ARE THE MOST\nDIVERSE GROUP OF MUSLIMS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.\nWE WERE STANDING BY THE VALUES OF OUR CONSTITUTION, BRINGING\nTHE COUNTRY TOGETHER. WE NEED TO DO THAT AGAIN.\n>> THE CHALLENGING THING, ALSO, TO COVER, JOHN, ON 9/11 BECAUSE\nIT WAS ONE SIDE WANTED THIS TO BE A CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS.\nAL QAEDA AND ISLAMIST TERRORIST GROUP WANTED THIS TO BE A CLASH\nOF CIVILIZATIONS WHILE PRESIDENT BUSH THE WHITE HOUSE AND\nADMINISTRATION DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE THEM THE BENEFIT OF THAT\nBEING THE NARRATIVE. >> WE HAVE THE CONVERSATION\nABOUT THE DOMINO EFFECTS. A LOT OF THINGS CHANGED ON 9/11.\nSO MUCH ELSE CHANGED. MIDWAY THROUGH THE DAY WHEN WE\nFIRST STARTED TO REESTABLISH COMMUNICATIONS WITH SOURCES.\nREMEMBER, EVERYBODY WAS IN CRISIS MODE WHEN THE PLANES WERE\nHITTING AND THEN EVERYBODY WAS MOVING AROUND .S.\nTHERE WAS NOT A LOT OF GREAT COMMUNICATIONS.\nFINALLY, MIDDLE OF THE WAY, FINALLY GOT THROUGH TO AN\nINTELLIGENCE SOURCE WHO SAID THIS IS UNMISTAKABLE.\nIT'S BIN LADEN, AL QAEDA. YOU STARTED TO HAVE THOSE\nCONVERSATIONS. REMEMBER, AS WE TALK ABOUT THE\nAFTER MOMENTS, A BIT LATER WE LEARNED -- MARY WAS WITH THE\nVICE PRESIDENT. WE WERE ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT\nWHO IS IN CHARGE, WHO IS CALLING THE SHOTS MINUTE BY MINUTE.\nIT'S A REMARKABLE THING. WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THE UNITED\nSTATES GOVERNMENT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TERRORIST ATTACK.\nAND WE LEARNED THE VICE PRESIDENT AUTHORIZED THE\nSHOOT-DOWN ORDERS. NORM MA NETTA WAS THE\nTRANSPORTATION SECRETARY, GROUNDING ALL THE PLANES.\nI AM NOT TAKING ISSUE WITH WHO ISSUED THE ORDERS.\nTHE THINGS THAT WERE HAPPENING ON THAT DAY WHEN THE\nTRANSPORTATION SECRETARY SAYS GET EVERYTHING OUT OF THE SKY,\nTHE ADMINISTRATION, THE PRESIDENT AND THE VICE PRESIDENT\nAUTHORIZED SHOOTING DOWN AIRPLANES.\nIT WAS JUST A DAY THAT WAS, AGAIN, AS SECRETARY JOHNSON\nSAID -- >> ONE OF THE CIVILIAN PLANES\nWAS GEORGE HERBERT WALKER BUSH WAS IN IT.\nTHAT'S WHY I STARTED WITH THE POINT I DID.\nTHE SEAMLESSNESS IN THE FOG OF WAR WITH WHICH THE MEN WHO HAD\nPREVIOUSLY WORKED TOGETHER AND HAD DEFENSE EXPERIENCE, IT\nWAS -- I AM -- I AM NOT BEING A PARTISAN WHEN I SAY I CANNOT\nTHINK OF ANOTHER TEAM THAT KNEW WHAT TO DO AUTOMATICALLY.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT KNEW AUTOMATICALLY WHICH WERE THE\nPRESIDENT'S CALLS TO MAKE AND WHICH HE HAD TO MAKE\nIMMEDIATELY. THIS IS NOT COMMON.\nMAY HE REST IN PEACE AL HAIG WHEN PRESIDENT REAGAN SAID I AM\nIN CHARGE. THERE WAS NONE OF THAT.\n>> HERE COMES PRESIDENT OBAMA.",

BUSH WAS COMING TO THE BUILDING THAT DAY.\nTHAT FLAG HAS MOVED OFF TO AN ARMY HISTORY CENTER.\nBUT AGAIN THIS FLAG HANGS NEARLY 15 YEARS TO THE DAY THAT THE\nFIRST FLAG HUNG 15 YEARS AFTER THE 9/11 ATTACKS.\n>> AND I WANT TO GET BACK INTO THE POLITICAL DISCUSSION THAT WE\nWERE JUST HAVING ABOUT THE SHAPE OF OUR COUNTRY AS WE HEAD INTO\nTHIS PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. AND TO DO SO, I WANT TO BRING IN\nREPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN, FORMER REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN FROM\nGEORGIA JACK KINGSTON. HE'S ALSO A SENIOR ADVISOR FOR\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. AND SUSAN JOHNSON COOK.\nSHE'S A HILLARY CLINTON SUPPORTER.\nVICTOR JUST HAD THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT THE BASKET OF\nDEPLORABLES CONTROVERSY THAT HAS POPPED UP.\nWE KNOW THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS REACTED TO THAT IN AN\nINTERESTING WAY. HE RETWEETED A TWEET FROM BARACK\nOBAMA FROM BACK IN 2012 SAYING WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO'S\nFIGHTING FOR ALL AMERICANS, NOT ONE WHO WRITES OFF NEARLY HALF\nTHE COUNTRY. WHY GO BACK TO PRESIDENT OBAMA\nAT THAT POINT? >> WELL, I THINK THAT HE WAS\nREFERRING TO THE MITT ROMNEY 47% COMMENT, WHICH IS WHAT HILLARY\nCLINTON WAS REALLY DOING IN ONE SAY, SAYING THAT THERE'S A HALF\nOF THE COUNTRY OR HALF OF THE TRUMP PEOPLE THAT I DON'T CARE\nABOUT. I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU.\nTO ME, PARTICULARLY ON THE EVE OF 9/11, THIS IS AN EXTREMELY\nOFFENSIVE COMMENT TO CALL AMERICAN VOTERS DEPLORABLE JUST\nBECAUSE YOU DISAGREE WITH THEM PHILOSOPHICALLY.\nIT'S A SAD MOMENT. THIS IS THE TIME PARTICULARLY ON\nTHIS DAY AND THIS TIME WE NEED TO BE UNIFIED AS A COUNTRY.\nHILLARY CLINTON IS TRYING TO PRETEND LIKE SHE'S THE UNIFIER.\nSHE LOST ALL HER MORAL GROUND. >> HELP A LOT OF PEOPLE\nUNDERSTAND TRUMP, WHO HAS CALLED IMMIGRANTS RAPISTS AND WHO HAS\nSAID DEMEANING THINGS ABOUT WOMAN AND WHO HAS CALLED PEOPLE\nLOSERS, HOW IS HE UNIFYING? >> WELL, I THINK, NUMBER ONE,\nHE'S APOLOGIZED. TWO, HE'S TONED DOWN THE\nRHETORIC. WE NEED TO BE TALKING ABOUT\nECONOMICS, WE NEED TO BE TALKING ABOUT NATIONAL SECURITY AND WE\nDON'T NEED TO BE CALLING PEOPLE RACIST, SEXIST, ISLAMOPHOBIC AND\nSO FORTH. WHAT BILL CLINTON SAID, HE SAID\nMAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN IS CODE TALK.\nHE SAID IF YOU'RE SOUTHERN, WHITE, AMERICAN, THAT YOU KNOW\nWHAT THAT REALLY MEANS, EVEN THOUGH IT'S A PHRASE HE'S USED\nREPEATEDLY HIMSELF. IT IS OFFENSIVE TO ME BECAUSE\nI'M WHITE AND I'M SOUTHERN. WE'RE ALL AMERICANS AND WE'RE\nFACED WITH A VERY POOR ECONOMY AND WE'RE FACED WITH A DISASTER\nFOREIGN POLICY THAT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT.\n>> I WANT TO GET TO AMBASSADOR COOK HERE.\nDO YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT? >> I DEFINITELY DO.\n>> IN COMPARISON TO THE 47% SAID BY MITT ROMNEY, IS THAT A FAIR\nCOMPARISON? >> HE'S TRYING TO MAKE TRUMP\nTHIS BIG UNIFIER NOW THAT HE'S TONED DOWN THE RHETORIC.\nWE WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE TONING IT DOWN IF IT HADN'T GOT ON THE\nTHIS POINT. IT'S INCREASED AND A LARGE PART\nOF IT IS BECAUSE OF TRUMP. AS AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN\nI'VE BEEN INSULTED BECAUSE WHAT HE HAS SAID HAS BEEN DEPLORABLE.\nSO WHAT SECRETARY CLINTON SAID BASICALLY REPRESENTED WHAT A LOT\nOF US HAVE BEEN FEELING THAT WE HAVE BEEN DUMPED ON AND TRUMPED\nON. AS WE GO FORWARD, FOR HIM TO\nREACH BACK TO SOMETHING THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID TO ALSO\nBRING DOWN SECRETARY CLINTON AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT IS REALLY\nREACHING FOR STRAWS. LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW DO WE GO\nFORWARD. IT IS 9/11.\nIT IS A TIME FOR UNIFYING. AS ONE WHO WAS ON THE FRONT\nLINES OF 9/11, I THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT NIGHT IT WAS NOT\nBLACK, IT WAS NOT WHITE, IT WAS GRAY.\nIT WAS GRAY SOOT COVERING EVERYONE.\n>> I WANTED TO GET TO THAT EXACTLY.\nYOU WROTE THE NIGHT RACE DIDN'T MATTER AND YOU WROTE TALKING\nABOUT WHEN YOU WENT DOWN TO GROUND ZERO THAT NIGHT AND ALL\nYOU SAW WAS THE SOOT, THAT IT WAS COMING DOWN LIKE SNOW, YOU\nWROTE. AND SAYING, FOR A FEW SHORT DAYS\nWE WORKED TOGETHER, CRIED TOGETHER, WORSHIPPED TOGETHER,\nCOVERED WITH GRAY, NO BLACK, NO WHITE, ONLY AMERICAN.\nVICTOR AND I WERE COMMENTING JUST A LITTLE BIT AGO WHEN WE\nSAW VIDEO OF OUR LEADERS, OF OUR CONGRESS PEOPLE STANDING ON THE\nSTEPS OF THE CAPITAL SINGING GOD BLESS AMERICA.\nHOW CAN YOU SEE AMERICA COME TOGETHER AGAIN LIKE THAT WITHOUT\nANOTHER 9/11? WHY DOES IT TAKE THAT?\nTHAT'S TO AMBASSADOR COOK FIRST, PLEASE.\n>> OKAY. >> HOPEFULLY IT WILL NOT TAKE\nANOTHER TRAGEDY AND TERROR. THEY WERE STANDING ON THE STEPS\nTHE NEXT DAY, BUT THERE WERE ALSO PEOPLE THAT PARTICULAR DAY\nTHAT IT HAPPENED WHOSE NAMES WERE NEVER CALLED.\nWHAT IT WILL TAKE IS PEOPLE REALLY HAVING A MINDSET TO GO\nFORWARD TOGETHER, NOT TO SAY THINGS THAT ARE DEPLORABLE, NOT\nTO SAY THINGS THAT DIVIDE, BUT TO HAVE A MINDSET TO WORK\nTOGETHER. IT'S EVERY DAY AMERICAN CITIZENS\nSAYING WE'RE GOING TO WALK TOGETHER, WE'RE GOING TO WORK\nTOGETHER, NOT TRY AND HAVE CAMPS THAT HATE AND DIVIDE BUT TO HAVE\nUNITY. >> I STOOD ON THE CAPITAL STEPS\nAND SUNG GOD BLESS AMERICA THAT DAY.\nI DIDN'T SEE IT AS SOME FEW DAYS OF NATIONAL UNITY.\nI'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT AMERICA IS GOING TO HAVE ITS DIVISIONS AND\nDISAGREEMENTS, BUT WE'RE STILL A UNIFIED AMERICA.\nI DON'T SEE AMERICA IN TERMS OF THIS ONE CAMP OR THE OTHER\nDESPITE WHAT CANDIDATES MAY SAY, I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\nSTILL REMAIN UNIFIED THAT THIS IS THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE\nWORLD AND IT'S A COUNTRY THAT CAN GET EVEN BETTER AND WE CAN\nDO IT WHEN WE PULL TOGETHER. WE'VE GOT TO FACE THE NATIONAL\nSECURITY ISSUES IN FRONT OF THE COUNTRY.\nWE'VE GOT TO STRENGTHEN OUR ECONOMY AND GET MORE JOBS OUT\nTHERE. BUT I SEE AMERICA AS A LAND OF A\nLOT OF OPTIMISM. I DON'T SEE THE LAND OF GREAT\nDIVISIONS THAT SEEM TO BE FOCUSED ON SO MUCH THESE DAYS.\nI'M OPTIMISTIC. >> I'VE NEVER BEEN MORE PROUD TO\nBE AN AMERICAN, BUT WE HAVE NOT WALKED TOGETHER IN THIS\nPARTICULAR TIME PERIOD. WHEN WE SAY THINGS THAT HURT\nPEOPLE, THAT'S NOT GOING TO HELP US KWUNUNIFY.\n>> WE'VE RUN OUT OF TIME. I APPRECIATE BOTH OF YOU BEING\nHERE, ESPECIALLY ON THIS DAY WHEN WE GET TO TALK ABOUT TRYING\nTO UNIFY EVERYBODY AND REMEMBERING WHY WE'RE HERE AND\nWHAT IT WAS LIKE IN THOSE MOMENTS AFTER 9/11, BECAUSE IT\nWAS VERY PROFOUND, AS YOU BOTH KNOW, BOTH BEING THERE.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH.",

I JUST HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT, YOU\nKNOW, ONE OR TWO PEOPLE ARE GOING TO FEEL THAT WAY AND\nTHAT'S THEIR RIGHT AND THEN THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE IS PRETTY\nCLEAR ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND WHAT WE WERE\nTRYING TO MANAGE AT THE TIME. >> IN FACT, THE LAST OF THE\nINVESTIGATIONS WAS REVEALED TO ALSO BE POLITICALLY MOTIVATED\nWHEN THE NUMBER TWO REPUBLICAN IN THE HOUSE SAID THIS --\n>> EVERYBODY THOUGHT HILLARY CLINTON WAS UNBEATABLE, RIGHT?\nBUT WE PUT TOGETHER A BENGHAZI SPECIAL COMMITTEE, A SELECT\nCOMMITTEE. WHAT ARE HER NUMBERS TODAY?\nHER NUMBERS ARE DROPPING. WHY?\nBECAUSE SHE'S UNTRUSTABLE. BUT NO ONE WOULD HAVE KNOWN ANY\nOF THAT HAD HAPPENED HAD WE NOT THOUGHT AND MADE SOMETHING\nHAPPEN. >> BENGHAZI REMAINS A HAUNTING\nLEGACY FOR CLINTON. >> YOU KNOW, I WOULD IMAGINE\nI'VE THOUGHT MORE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED THAN ALL OF YOU PUT\nTOGETHER. I'VE LOST MORE SLEEP THAN ALL OF\nYOU PUT TOGETHER. >> BUT THE POLITICAL FALLOUT\nDIDN'T KEEP HER FROM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT ONE MORE TIME.\n>> LET'S GO OUT AND MAKE THAT PROMISE TO AMERICA.\n>> NEXT.

FIRST ONE, AN EARLIER VERSION OF\nTHIS ARTICLE MISIDENTIFIED THE DE FACTO CAPITAL OF THE ISLAMIC\nSTATE. IT IS RAQQAH IN NORTHERN SYRIA,\nNOT ALEPPO. CORRECTION.\nAN EARLIER VERSION OF THE ABOVE CORRECTION MISIDENTIFIED THE\nSYRIAN CAPITAL AS ALEPPO. IT IS DAMASCUS.\nSO YOU JUST READ A CORRECTION OF A CORRECTION TO AN ARTICLE ABOUT\nJOHNSON NOT KNOWING ALEPPO. IF YOU WAIT TEN MINUTES, THERE\nWILL BE A CORRECTION OF THAT CORRECTION.\nBELIEVE ME, I WORK IN MEDIA. WHEN MOST PEOPLE HEAR ALEPPO\nTHEY THINK IT'S AN ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER.\nWORSE, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT ALEPPO IS BUT DON'T CARE\nBECAUSE IT'S FAR AWAY, IT'S NOT OUR FIGHT AND WE ARE LUCKY NOT\nTO BE BORN THERE. ON FRIDAY, THE U.S. AND RUSSIA\nANNOUNCED A PLAN TO BRING PEACE TO SYRIA BUT DON'T HOLD YOUR\nBREATH. MEANWHILE, SOME TRUMP AND\nHILLARY SUPPORTERS SAY JOHNSON'S GAFFE IS A DISQUALIFIER.\nREALLY? REMEMBER WHEN TRUMP SAID HE GOT\nMILITARY ADVICE FROM THE SHOWS, OR WHEN HILLARY CLAIMED NOT TO\nKNOW HOW TO WIPE A SERVER WHILE SHE WAS WIPING A SERVER?\nLET'S FACE IT, THE OTHER TWO CANDIDATES EMIT GAFFES LIKE\nBULLDOGS BREAKING WIND. THIS IS THE PROBLEM WITH\nLIBERTARIANS. THAT ISOLATIONIST SHRUG IN THE\nFACE OF FOREIGN HORROR. THEY IGNORE THE LUCK OF BIRTH\nTHAT IS EASY TO BE LIBERTARIAN IN NEW MEXICO, NOT SO MUCH IN\nLIBERIA.

HE OWNED HIS MISTAKES WHICH IS\nOFTEN HARDER THAN OWNING BUILDINGS.\n>> PERIOD. >> IF YOU ARE A GARY JOHNSON\nFAN, YOU DO LIKE HIM, HOW DID YOU FEEL WHEN THIS HAPPENED AND\nHOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE RESPONSE?\n>> I WAS EMBARRASSED FOR HIM AND FOR MYSELF.\nIT WAS REALLY, REALLY BAD. IT WAS AN AWFUL THING.\nI CRITICIZED HIM FOR IT A LOT. BUT THEN I WAS THINKING A LITTLE\nBIT MORE AND I WAS LIKE SO DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T KNOW WHAT\nBREXIT WAS WHEN HE WAS ASKED. REMEMBER WHEN IT'S HILLARY\nCLINTON, SOMEBODY ASKED HER HOW SHE FELT ABOUT PRESIDENT OBAMA'S\nENDORSEMENT AND SHE SAID TRY THE COLD CHAI, IT'S DELICIOUS.\nI FEEL THAT'S WAY WORSE. NO ONE'S RUNNING AROUND SAYING\nCAN YOU BELIEVE SHE DON'T KNOW WHO OBAMA IS.\nPEOPLE JUST KIND OF LET IT GO. IF YOU WANT TO MAKE THAT A\nDISQUALIFIER, THEN BOTH OF THEM ARE DISQUALIFIED, TOO, BECAUSE\nTRUMP, A LOT OF INTERVIEWS HE TALKS ABOUT ISIS LEADERS HE\nDIDN'T REALLY KNOW. HILLARY IS CAPTAIN OF TEAM I\nDON'T KNOW. WHENEVER SHE, I DON'T KNOW, I\nDON'T KNOW. IF YOU SUPPORT HER AND YOU\nBELIEVE SHE'S TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT HER E-MAILS YOU ARE SAYING\nTHAT YOU BELIEVE SHE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO HANDLE CLASSIFIED\nINFORMATION EVEN THOUGH HER JOB IS TO HANDLE CLASSIFIED\nINFORMATION, THAT SHE DOESN'T KNOW THAT MAYBE THINGS ABOUT\nDRONE STRIKES, DISCUSSIONS ABOUT DRONE STRIKES MIGHT BE SENSITIVE\nINFORMATION, EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT A MILITARY\nOPERATION. THAT'S A LITTLE MORE SERIOUS\nTHAN NOT KNOWING SOMETHING IN A TELEVISION APPEARANCE.\nTHE STAKES ARE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER.\nLET'S ALL GAIN SOME PERSPECTIVE. IT WAS REALLY EMBARRASSING BUT\nLIKE COME ON. THE REACTION WAS SO OVERBLOWN\nIT'S RIDICULOUS. >> WOW.\nANYBODY DISAGREE WITH THAT? GO AHEAD.\n>> BEST PRESS GARY JOHNSON HAS HAD TO DATE.\nHE IS SO CLOSE TO GETTING TO 15% AND HE'S LIKE ALEPPO?\nI'M AN ISOLATIONIST, I DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO OTHER COUNTRIES.\nI'M IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL PARTY. >> WOULD YOU SAY THAT MEANS\nHILLARY CLINTON DIDN'T KNOW WHO OBAMA WAS?\n>> USING YOUR THEORY BEFORE ABOUT NOT USING, WE HAVE TO\nGRADE THEM ALL EQUALLY, YOU ARE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.\nYOU SHOULD KNOW WHERE COUNTRIES ARE.\nYOU SHOULD KNOW WHERE STATES ARE.\nYOU SHOULD KNOW WHERE CAPITALS ARE, ESPECIALLY IF YOUR ENTIRE\nPARTY IS BASED OFF OF YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON FOREIGN POLICY.\nSO I CRITICIZE HILLARY CLINTON BUT THAT'S STRATEGIC.\nHER I DON'T KNOW IS LIKE I DON'T WANT TO BE CAUGHT IN SOME KIND\nOF LITIGATION. >> I'M NOT EVEN DEFENDING WHAT\nHE SAID. I THOUGHT IT WAS A HUGE MISTAKE\nAND EMBARRASSING AND I HATE IT BUT THE REACTION OF ONLY THAT\nONE THING IS DISQUALIFYING WHEN THEY BOTH HAVE DONE THE SAME\nTHING REPEATEDLY IS INSANE. >> I JUST WANT TO GET RID OF ALL\nOF THEM. >> THAT'S FAIR.\nYOU CAN SAY THAT.

WELL, DONALD TRUMP AND LET'S NOT\nBRING UP HILLARY ALEPPO BECAUSE YOU KNOW SHE DIDN'T CHECK HER\nE-MAILS DOWN THERE AND I'M SURE, DONALD, HE BOUGHT SOMETHING\nTHERE AND DIDN'T PAY FOR IT. DON'T ASK ME, ASK HIM.\nASK ME ABOUT ALEPPO, WHY DON'T YOU GET THEM IN HERE AND TELL\nTHEM ABOUT SOME ALEPPO. I'M A LIBERTARIAN.\nVOTE FOR ME IS A VOTE FOR FREEDOM.\n>> I LIKED HIS RESPONSE. HE THOUGHT IT WAS AN ACRONYM BUT\nHE OWNED IT. HE SAID IF THAT DISQUALIFIES ME,\nSO BE IT. >> IF THE QUESTION HAD BEEN WHAT\nDO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN ALEPPO OR\nSOMETHING. IT WAS MORE OF A GOTCHA\nQUESTION. I WOULDN'T HAVE CAUGHT THAT ON\nTHE FIRST GO-ROUND EITHER. I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT, YOU KNOW,\nTHE SIXTH MARX BROTHER.

CNN POLITICS PRODUCER DAN\nMERRICK WAS PART OF THE PRESS CORPS WHEN THE EVENT HAPPENED\nEARLIER THIS MORNING. HE IS JOINING US RIGHT NOW\nOUTSIDE OF HILLARY CLINTON'S APARTMENT IN CHAPPAQUA, NEW\nYORK.

AND THEN HAS EVENTS ON TUESDAY\nIN CALIFORNIA, AND THEN EVENTS ON WEDNESDAY.\nALL OF THAT REMAINS, WE HAVE NOT BEEN TOLD IF ANYTHING IS\nCANCELLED.

THE REASON THIS IS AN ISSUE FOR\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS THAT THESE RUMORS AND TALK ABOUT HER\nHEALTH HAS KIND OF FESTERED ON RIGHT WING WEBSITES FOR MONTHS\nNOW. AND THE VIDEO THAT WE HAVE BEEN\nPLAYING AND THE ELEMENTS WE HAVE BEEN PLAYING HAVE ELEVATED IT\nAND MADE IT INTO A TOPIC THAT THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA IS NOW\nTALKING ABOUT. >> TELL US, DAN, WHAT HAPPENED\nWHEN SHE LEFT THE 9/11 MEMORIAL EARLY.\nWE SAW HER STUMBLE AS SHE GOT INTO THE VAN.\nNORMALLY THE TRAVELING PRESS CORPS, AT LEAST A POOL OF\nREPORTERS WHO COVER HILLARY CLINTON, THEY WOULD FOLLOW THAT\nVAN WHEREVER IT IS GOING. BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE THEY\nLEFT WITHOUT THE PRESS CORPS. WHAT HAPPENED?\n>> SO IT'S A PROTECTIVE POOL, SO THE WHITE HOUSE, IT FOLLOWS\nPRESIDENT OBAMA WHEREVER HE GOES, IF HE GOES TO THE GYM,\nTHEY GO. IF HE GOES TO GET COFFEE, THEY\nGO. THE CAMPAIGN HAS NOT FULLY\nBOUGHT INTO THIS, MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT AT TIMES TO COVER HER.\nSHE LEFT UNDER THE MEMORIAL EVENT WHILE HER PRESS CORPS\nSTAYED IN THE MEDIA AREA WHERE THE MEDIA WAS FOR THE EVENT.\nSHE THEN WENT TO CHELSEA CLINTON'S HOUSE, AND THE PRESS\nPOOL GOT THERE LATER, AND THEN HILLARY CLINTON LEFT CHELSEA\nCLINTON'S HOUSE AND WENT BACK TO CHAPPAQUA, NEW YORK.\nIT'S AN ISSUE THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO COVER HER.\nYOU DON'T KNOW WHEN SHE IS GETTING HOME, WHERE SHE IS, THAT\nSORT OF THING. AND IT'S NOT REALLY STANDARD AT\nTHIS POINT IN THE CAMPAIGN. IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED,\nHOWEVER, THAT DONALD TRUMP WENT TO THE SAME MEMORIAL WITHOUT A\nPRESS POOL. >> SO RIGHT NOW, WE'RE BASICALLY\nSTANDING BY TO GET AN UPDATE FROM THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN,\nEITHER A WRITTEN STATEMENT OR SOME SORT OF APPEARANCE BEFORE\nTHE CAMERAS TO AT LEAST RECONFIRM THAT EVERYTHING IS\nSTILL ON SCHEDULE FOR THAT WEST COAST TRIP TOMORROW MORNING.\n>> ABSOLUTELY, AND THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.\nTHIS HAS BECOME A BIG MEDIA STORY.\nTHEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WEIGH IN TO TALK ABOUT HER HEALTH AND\nTO CONFIRM SHE IS STILL GOING TO FLY CROSS COUNTRY TOMORROW FOR\nWHAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED A FULL DAY OF CAMPAIGNING, A FUNDRAISER\nIN SAN FRANCISCO, MULTIPLE FUNDRAISERS IN L.A., AND EVENTS\nIN LOS ANGELES. ALL IN ABOUT 72 HOURS.\nSO THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CONFIRM THAT THAT IS STILL ON,\nGIVEN THAT SHE HAD THIS INCIDENT AFTER THE MEMORIAL SERVICE DOWN\nAT GROUND ZERO. >> DAN, AS SOON AS YOU GET WORD\nON WHAT IS GOING TO UNFOLD, GET BACK TO US, THANK YOU FOR YOUR\nEXCELLENT WORK ALL THE WAY AROUND.\nLET'S TAKE A QUICK BREAK.

THE ONLY STATEMENT WE GOT FROM\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN WAS LATE IN THE MORNING, WHEN HILLARY\nCLINTON DID IN FACT GET OVERHEATED.\nAND THAT IS WHY SHE LEFT THE 9/11 MEMORIAL EARLIER AND CAME\nTO CHELSEA CLINTON'S HOME. BUT WE DID LEARN THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON DID IN FACT APPEAR TO FAINT.\nI WANT TO BE CLEAR THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT THE CAMPAIGN\nCONFIRMED. BUT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS\nSAID HILLARY CLINTON DID IN FACT APPEAR TO FAINT THIS MORNING.\nWE'LL LEARN IF THEY GIVE US ANY INFORMATION ON HER STATUS RIGHT\nNOW. AND YOU'RE RIGHT, SHE DID COME\nHERE THIS MORNING TO HER DAUGHTER'S HOME.\nAND WHEN SHE CAME OUT SHE SAID SHE WAS FEELING GREAT, SMILING,\nEVEN ALPAUSED TO TAKE A PHOTO WH A LITTLE GIRL WAITING OUTSIDE.\nNO UPDATES AS OF RIGHT NOW ON WHETHER OR NOT THE EPISODE WILL\nEND UP AFFECTING HER TRAVEL PLANS.\nTOMORROW SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO FLY TO CALIFORNIA.\nSHE HAS A NUMBER OF FUNDRAISER AND CAMPAIGN EVENTS SCHEDULED ON\nTHE WEST COAST, WE DON'T KNOW YET IF ANY OF THOSE PLANS WILL\nBE AFFECTED. >> OKAY, M.J. LEE, THANK YOU FOR\nJOINING US. AND FOR THE UPDATE.\nLAST YEAR, HER PHYSICIAN DID RELEASE A LETTER SIGNING OFF ON\nHER HIT. THAT LETTER FROM DR. LISA\nBARDAK, SAYING THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS FIT TO SERVE AS\nPRESIDENT. CLINTON HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED AS\nHYPOTHYROIDISM. SHE TAKES A MEDICATION AND THE\nBLOOD THINNER, CUMADIN. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS WITH\nDR. SANJAY GUPTA. I WANT TO GET TO FIRST WHAT LAW\nENFORCEMENT REPORTED. THIS IS FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT,\nSAYING SHE APPEARS TO HAVE FAINTED.\n>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF THAT.\nPEOPLE USE THE TERM IN DIFFERENT WAYS, YOU SAW THE VIDEO, I'M NOT\nSURE IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE POINT WHERE SHE STUMBLED.\nAPPEARS TO HAVE FAINTED, VERSUS SOMEBODY WHO FAINTED OR LOST\nCONSCIOUSNESS, I DON'T KNOW, I CAN'T TELL, SO IF SOMEBODY IS\nSAYING THAT THEY SAW THAT AND THAT IS CONFIRMED.\nOBVIOUSLY THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER PIECE OF INFORMATION.\nBUT YOU HAVE TO PIECE IT TOGETHER WITH EVERYTHING ELSE\nSTILL. >> YOU'RE RIGHT, AND WE'RE JUST\nNOT GOING TO DO THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE EXTRAORDINARY ACCURATE\nWITH JUST WHAT WE SEE HERE. SO LET'S HAVE YOU LOOK AT WHAT\nYOU SEE, SANJAY GUPTA, HAPPENING.\n>> WELL, SHE IS CLEARLY GETTING HELP AS SHE STANDS THERE.\nLOOK AT THE MOVEMENTS, SHE HAS A DIFFICULTY WITH BALANCE, CLEARLY\nSTUMBLES, TRYING TO GET INTO THE VAN AT THAT POINT.\nAND THEN, OBVIOUSLY THE DOORS CLOSE AND WE DON'T SEE HER\nAGAIN, AN HOUR AND A HALF, TO TWO HOURS LATER WHERE SHE\nAPPEARS FINE. WHAT DO I SEE THERE?\nIT'S SOMEBODY WHO IS CLEARLY HAVING DIFFICULTY WITH THEIR\nBALANCE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SAY MORE\nTHAN",

YOU CAN SEE HER APPEARING TO\nLOSE HER BALANCE AS HER AIDES ASSIST HER INTO THE CAR\nMOTORCADE THEN TOOK HER TO HER DAUGHTER CLINTON'S NEARBY\nAPARTMENT, A FEW HOURS LATER SHE LEFT THE APARTMENT, YOU SEE THE\nVIDEO WAVING TO REPORTERS IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION SHE SAID\nSHE FELT GREAT. CNN POLITICS PRODUCER DAN MERICA\nWAS PART OF THE TRAVELING PRESS CORPS, DANA IS JOINING US ON THE\nPHONE RIGHT NOW. SHE'S IN CHAPPAQUA\nAT HER HOME.

SHE CLEARLY TRIED TO SQUASH THAT\nWHEN SHE LEFT HILLARY CLINTON'S HOME APARTMENT IN MANHATTAN\nTODAY. SHE WALKED OUT, SHE WAVED TO THE\nCROWD, A YOUNG GIRL KIND OF RAN OVER TO HER FROM A RESTAURANT\nNEARBY AND SAID SHE WAS FEELING GREAT AND A BEAUTIFUL NEW YORK\nDAY.

THIS IS SOMETHING TALKED ABOUT\nFOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS AND MONTHS AND THE CAMPAIGN ALREADY\nRESPONDED TO IT. THERE'S NO INDICATION SHE'LL\nGIVE A STATEMENT TO THE PRESS OR HAVE HER DOCTOR COME OUT.\nIT'S CLEARLY SOMETHING THEY HAVE TO ADDRESS IN THE COMING DAYS\nWHAT HAPPENED. THEY SAID SHE GOT OVERHEATED,\nBUT THE VIDEO SHOWS HER KIND OF WITH A LOWING INTO THE CAR SO\nTHERE'S GOING TO BE MORE QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE\nANSWERED. SHE'S SUPPOSED TO FLY TO\nCALIFORNIA FOR A FUND-RAISER IN SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES SO\nWE'RE EXPECTING OR HOPING WE'LL SEE HER, MAYBE GET TO TALK TO\nHER SOMETIME TOMORROW ON THE PLANE.\n>> AS OF NOW THAT TRIP IS STILL SCHEDULED?\n>> Reporter: AS OF NOW THE TRIP IS STILL SCHEDULED.\nSCHEE HAS AN EVENT IN LOS ANGELES AND LAS VEGAS EARLY NEXT\nWEEK.

THE THING I'LL NEVER FORGET IS\nTO WATCH THAT FIRST TOWER COLLAPSE.\nFOR THOSE OF US IN NEW YORK THE TWIN TOWERS HAD BEEN A PERMANENT\nFIXEUR ON THE SKYSCRAPER, THE LANDSCAPE FOR ALMOST 40 YEARS\nTHEN. >> WHEN YOU FIRST SAW IT, IT'S\nSO HIGH, I REALLY DIDN'T COMPREHEND IT, YET IT WAS, I\nTHOUGHT IT WAS DEBRIS AT FIRST.

LET'S WATCH THIS VID CROW FOR A\nSECOND. YOU SEE HER APPARENTLY ALMOST\nFALLING BUT CAUGHT BY PEOPLE PRESUMABLY SECRET SERVICE AGENTS\nAROUND HER. A LITTLE WHILE AGO WE SAW HER\nLEAVE THE APARTMENT BUILDING AND WAVE TO REPORTERS, LOOKING\nBETTER THAN IN THE VID CROW WE'RE SHOWING NOW.\nSHE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH TO SAY JUST NOW BUT YOU CAN LISTEN TO HOW\nSHE RESPONDED TO REPORTERS SHOUTED QUESTIONS.\n>> HOW ARE YOU FEELING HILLARY CLINTON?\nARE YOU FEELING BETTER? >> YES, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nTHANK YOU, EVERYBODY. >> CNN REPORTER MJ LEE IS\nOUTSIDE CHELSEA CLINTON'S APARTMENT WHERE HILLARY CLINTON\nWENT TO E RECUPERATE. SHE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH TO SAY WHEN\nE SHE LEFT REPORTERS. ASKED HER TO COME OVER AND TELL\nTHEM WHAT HAPPENED AND SHE SAID IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY IN NEW\nYORK. >> THAT'S RIGHT, JAKE.\nTHIS HAS TURNED INTO A TENSE MORNING FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nWE ARE OUTSIDE OF CHELSEA CLINTON'S HOUSE IN THE FLAT IRON\nDISTRICT WHERE SHE DID LEAVE BEFORE NOON.\nYOU HEARD HER SAME SHE WAS FEELING GREAT.\nWE DON'T KNOW THE EXTENT. THE ONLY THING THE CAMPAIGN TOLD\nUS IS SHE WAS FEELING OVERHEATED AND THAT'S WHY SHE CAME TO HER\nDAUGHTER'S HOME HERE CUTTING THE KCOMMEMORATION A LITTLE BIT\nEARLY. NOW KEEP IN MIND THAT THE\nCAMPAIGN VERY MUCH WANTED TODAY TO BE FREE OF POLITICS, BUT FOR\nSURE WE KNOW THAT THE ISSUES ABOUT HER HEALTH AND WHAT\nHAPPENED THIS MORNING ARE CERTAIN TO FUEL QUESTIONS ABOUT\nHILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH, TRUMP ALLIES AND CRITICS HAVE\nCONTINUED TO BRING UP QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER SHE IS IN A GOOD\nSTATE OF HEALTH TO ASSUME THE WHITE HOUSE IN THE OFFICE OF THE\nWHITE HOUSE. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT COULD BE\nRENEWED BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED THIS MORNING.\nTHE OTHER QUESTION IS ALSO WHETHER THIS ENDS UP AFFECTING\nHER TRAVEL. TOMORROW SHE IS SET TO HEAD WEST\nTO DO A WEST COAST SWING GOING TO SAN FRANCISCO, LOS ANGELES,\nSO WE'LL BE IN TOUCH WITH THE CAMPAIGN TO SEE WHETHER THIS\nENDS UP AFFECTING HER CAMPAIGN SCHEDULE THIS IT WEEK.\n>> THANK YOU SO MUCH. APPRECIATE IT.\nLET'S BRING IN OUR PANEL TO TALK MORE ABOUT THIS AND OTHER\nISSUES. WITH US IS DIANE BLACK, KIRSTEN\nPO POWERS AND COMMENTATOR ANDRE\nBAUER. LET ME START WITH YOU AND\nQUESTIONS ABOUT A CANDIDATE'S HEALTH.\nWE CAN TALK ABOUT RONALD REAGAN, BOB DOLE, JOHN McCAIN, NOW WE'RE\nTALKING ABOUT A DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE.\nLET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THAT VIDEO WE JUST GOT IN A SECOND AGO OF\nHILLARY CLINTON GETTING INTO HER VEHICLE AND SEEMING TO HAVE SOME\nTROUBLE STANDING AS SHE GETS INTO THE VEHICLE.\nSO IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY HAVING TROUBLE STANDING AND COULD BE\nEXPLAINED AWAY, BUT ALSO SHE DID HAVE THAT SERIOUS EPISODE WHEN\nSHE HAD THE BLOOD CLOT IN IT HER BRAIN IN 2012.\n>> WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS EARLIER WHEN WE WERE WATCHING\nTHIS. SHE'S HAD TWO INCIDENTS.\nONE SHE COUGHED AND THE OTHER SHE OVERHEATED.\nTHAT'S THE SERIES OF INCIDENTS SHE'S HAD THAT HAVE BEEN MEDICAL\nNEEDS. SHE'S ACTUALLY PROVIDED MORE\nINFORMATION THAN DONALD TRUMP HAS.\nDOES SHE NEED TO PROVIDE MORE? THAT'S A LEGITIMATE QUESTION TO\nASK. THE ONLY TIME THE REPUBLICAN\nPARTY SEEMS TO CARE ABOUT WOMEN'S HEALTH IS HILLARY'S\nHEALTH. WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT REAL\nISSUES AFFECTING THIS CAMPAIGN. TODAY IS NOT A DAY FOR HOL\nPICKS. SHE GOT OVERHEATED AND WE NEED\nTO MOVE ON AND TALK ABOUT THE ISSUESOVER THE DAY.\n>> I DO AGREE WITH THAT. I'M A NURSE.\nI U DON'T WANT TO SPECULATE WHAT WENT ON WITH HILLARY CLINTON.\nWE DON'T KNOW. THAT'S UP TO THE PHYSICIANS TO\nDETERMINE. BUT WHAT I WILL SAY IS I'M\nCONCERNED ABOUT HER POLICIES ON HEALTH CARE.\nI LOOK AT MY STATE OF TENNESSEE AND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS\nIMPLODING THERE. 63% WILL BE THE RISE IN\nPREMIUMS. WE LOST OUR CO-OP.\nI'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT SHE'S SAYING ABOUT HEALTH CARE.\nTRUE HEALTH CARE FOR OUR NATION AND MY STATE.\nI THINK IT WILL BE UP TO THE DOCTORS TO MAKE THAT DECISION.\nI U THINK IT'S PROBABLY LEGITIMATE TO ASK WHAT IS HER\nHEALTH. SHE HAS TO BE HONEST WITH THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE WHETHER SHE'S HEALTHY ENOUGH TO SERVE THE\nCOUNTRY. >> IT IS JUST AN ACCURATE FACT\nYULE MATTER WHATEVER YOU THINK OF HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH,\nDONALD TRUMP HAS DISCLOSED LESS INFORMATION.\nHE'S 70 YEARS OLD. HILLARY CLINTON IS 68.\nWOULD IT BE A GOOD IDEA FOR BOTH CANDIDATES O IT GET ALL THE\nHEALTH INFORMATION AS IS NORMALLY DONE AS BARACK OBAMA,\nMITT ROMNEY, JOHN McCAIN DID? >> IT WOULD BE.\nI THINK THE VOTERS WOULD LIKE TO KNOW.\nIT WOULD BE -- THE FACT THAT WE HAVE TWO CANDIDATES THAT WOULD\nBE THE OLDER CANDIDATES TO SERVE IN THE PRESIDENCY MAKES THE\nQUESTION MORE ONE THAT PEOPLE WOULD BE INTERESTED IN.\nJOHN McCAIN TURNED OVER A GREAT DOLE MORE OF HIS HEALTH RECORDS\nAS WELL. >> HE DID ABSOLUTELY.\nHE HAD SOME CANCER SCARES AS WELL.\nYOU THINK THE MEDIA IS MAKING T BIG OF A DEAL?\n>> IF IT'S DONALD TRUMP, WE WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT IT.\nBUT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HER HAVING HEALTH\nISSUE,S IT'S A COUGHING FIT. I HAVE HAD THIS BEFORE.\nTHIS COULD BE DEHYDRATION OR OVERTIRED OR IN THE HEAT.\nSO I DON'T THINK THAT NECESSARILY MEANS THAT SHE HAS\nSOME SERIOUS HEALTH ISSUES. I MEAN, I REMEMBER THE FIRST\nGEORGE BUSH PASSING OUT IN JAPAN AND HE'S BEEN VERY HEALTHY AND\nLIVED A LONG TIME AND HAS HAD NO OTHER REAL HEALTH ISSUES.\nI DON'T THINK WE CAN TAKE AWAY FROM THIS SHE HAS SERIOUS HEALTH\nISSUES. >> I'M NOT TRYING TO DIMINISH\nWHAT HAPPENED TODAY, BUT I RECALL GEORGE BUSH HIM CHOKING\nON A PRETZEL AND E EMERGING WITH A BRUISE ON HIS FACE AND THERE\nWERE A TON OF CONSPIRACY THEORIES ABOUT THAT.\n>> I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY WHAT IS REMARKABLE IN THIS IS THAT\nBOTH OF THESE CANDIDATES, THE SCHEDULE THEY KEEP IS GRUELING.\nALL OF US HAVE BEEN ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND THEY RUN YOU\nAS HARD AS THEY CAN. THE FACT THAT BOTH OF THEM ARE\nTHE AGE THEY ARE, THEY KEEP THE GROWLING SCHEDULE AND THE\nPRESSURE AND STRESS THEY ARE UNDER, I'M AMAZED WHEN I WATCH\nDONALD TRUMP AS LATE AS HE IS AND EARLY AS HE IS IN THE\nMORNING, BOTH OF THEM I HAVE BEEN AMAZED AT THEIR STAMINA.\n>> YOU'RE A NURSE. MY MOM IS A NURSE TOO.\nI KNOW HOW HARD A JOB IT IS. I APPRECIATE YOU'RE NOT WANTING\nTO SPECULATE. DO YOU AGREE BOTH TRUMP AND\nCLINTON SHOULD GET ALL THESE HEALTH RECORDS OUT THERE SO THE\nVOTERS CAN MAKE UP THEIR MINDS? >> I DO AGREE.\nI THINK IT IS SOMETHING WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW AS WE HAVE SOMEONE\nTHAT'S GOING TO SERVE OUR COUNTRY.\nIN REALLY DIFFICULT SITUATIONS AS ANDRE ALREADY SAID, THERE'S A\nLOT OF THE PHYSICAL NATURE OF THESE JOBS THAT PEOPLE DON'T\nREALIZE EARLY IN THE MORNING UNTIL LATE AT NIGHT, YOU'RE\nGOING ALL DAY. MANY TIMES YOU DON'T GET A\nCHANCE TO EAT AT NORMAL TIMES OR IN NORMAL FOOD.\nI DO THINK WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WHO\nWHOEVER IS GOING TO BE OUR COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF IS HEALTHY.\n>> THEY AGE 20 YEARS. COMING UP, THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN ON\nOFFENSE AS CLINTON TRIES TO DEFEND COMMENTS CALLING HALF OF\nHIS SUPPORTERS A BASKET OF DEP\nDEPL DEPLORABLE.\nTHAT'S NEXT.",

FOX'S PARENT COMPANY SETTLED THE\nLAWSUIT BROUGHT BY GRETCHEN CARLSON TO SETTLE HER SUIT\nAGAINST ROGER AILES ALLEGING SEXUAL HARASSMENT.\nON THE SAME DAY, GRETA WAS YANKED AND REPLACED BY BRETT\nHUME. SHE SAID FOX HAS NOT FELT LIKE\nHOME TO ME FOR YEARS. I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE CLAUSE\nIN MY CONTRACT. >> IT'S A KEY MAN CLAUSE.\nIF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD OF IT, MOST NETWORKS DON'T HAVE THEM.\nFOX DID FOR A NUMBER OF TOP STARS.\nSHE WALKED OUT BECAUSE AILES WALKED OUT.\nHERE TO TALK ABOUT ALL OF IT IS A REPORTER WHO BROKE THE NEWS\nABOUT THE SETTLEMENT, SARAH AND JANE HALL, A FORMER FOX NEWS\nCONTRIBUTOR. >> 20 MILLION FOR GRETCHEN\nCARLSON AND AILES $40 MILLION WHEN HE LEFT IN JULY.\nWHAT DOES IT MEAN? WHAT DOES THE APOLOGY MEAN?\n>> IT'S UNPRECEDENTED. NORMALLY IN A SETTLEMENT, YOU\nDON'T HAVE ADMISSION OF WRONG DOING OR AN APOLOGY.\nIT SHOWS THEY WERE TRYING TO HAND HER AN OLIVE BRANCH.\nIT'S ONE OF THE THINGS SHE STRONGLY SUGGESTED AS PART OF\nTHE SETTLEMENT. >> LET'S GO TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD\nOF MANHATTAN. HILLARY CLINTON WALKING OUT OF\nCHELSEA CLINTON'S APARTMENT NOW, POSSIBLY TAKING QUESTIONS.\nSOUNDS LIKE SHE'S BEING GREETED BY WELL WISHERS, INCLUDING A\nGIRL IN THE STREET. THIS IS OUTSIDE CHELSEA\nCLINTON'S APARTMENT. THE SIGNIFICANCE IS HILLARY\nCLINTON LEFT THE 9/11 CEREMONY EARLIER DUE TO SOME HEALTH\nCONCERN. SHE WASN'T FEELING WELL AT THE\nTIME. JEFF IS BACK WITH ME NOW,\nCOVERING THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN. FILL US IN ON THE SIGNIFICANCE\nOF COMING OUT BEFORE THE CAMERAS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A COUPLE\nHOURS. >> THEY WANT TO SHOW SHE IS\nALIVE, WELL AND WALKING THERE. SHE WAVED TO THE CAMERAS.\nIT LOOKS LIKE SHE SAID IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY, FROM THIS D\nDISTANCE COULDN'T HEAR IT. IT IS 80-82 DEGREES IN\nMANHATTAN, A HUMID, MUGGY DAY, I'M TOLD BY REPORTERS ON THE\nGROUND. THEY CLEARLY WANT TO MAKE THE\nIMAGE HERE SHE IS WALKING AND SHE IS MOVING AND SHE IS, YOU\nKNOW, TAKING ON HER DAY HERE. WE ARE NOT EXPECTED OR SHE IS\nNOT SCHEDULED TO BE IN PUBLIC ANYMORE AT THIS POINT.\nJUST TO RECAP, THIS COMES ON THE HEELS OF AFTER SHE VISITED THE\nGROUND ZERO CEREMONY, SHE WAS THERE FOR 90 OR SO MINUTES.\nHER CAMPAIGN RELEASED A STATEMENT SAYING SHE FELT\nOVERHEATED AND HAD TO LEAVE. SHE WAS SEEN BEING HELPED INTO\nHER VEHICLE, INTO HER VAN THERE BY SOME SECRET SERVICE AGENTS.\nYOU CAN SEE SHE IS WALKING OUT OF THE APARTMENT.\nSHE HAS HER SUN GASZS ON, WAVING TO THE REPORTERS THERE.\nCLEARLY, THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE THE CASE SHE IS, YOU KNOW, IS\nDOING WELL AND FINE. YOU HAVE TO WONDER, WILL THEY BE\nSORT OF FORCED TO RELEASE MORE MEDICAL RECORDS HERE BECAUSE SHE\nIS BEING CRITICIZED BY HER OPPONENTS HERE, THE QUESTIONS\nHAVE BEEN OUT THERE, IS SHE HEALTHY?\nWE DON'T KNOW SHE'S NOT. SHE'S RELEASED MORE THAN DONALD\nTRUMP BUT OTHERS HAVE RELEASED FAR LESS INFORMATION OVER THE\nYEARS. >> NORMALLY, BREAKING NEWS IS\nNOT HILLARY CLINTON LEAVING HER DAUGHTER'S APARTMENT.\nGIVEN THE QUESTIONS ABOUT HER HEALTH BY THE MEDIA AND\nREPORTERS, SHE HAD TO LEAVE THE CEREMONY EARLY AT GROUND ZERO.\nTHIS IS MID-AUGUST RELEASED BY THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN.\nCLINTON IS IN EXCELLENT HEALTH AND ABLE TO SERVE AS PRESIDENT\nOF THE UNITED STATES. THIS IS FROM HER PERSONAL\nPHYSICIAN. WHEN THERE'S A HEALTH CARE,\nTHAT'S WHAT YOU CALL THIS THIS MORNING, REPORTERS ARE GOING TO\nASK MORE ABOUT THIS. DO YOU THINK IT WAS SIGNIFICANT\nFOR AN HOUR AND A HALF THE PRESS POOL THAT TRAVELS WITH HER\nDIDN'T KNOW WHERE SHE WAS? >> IT IS SIGNIFICANT.\nIT'S PROTECTIVE FOR A REASON. ONCE A CANDIDATE BECOMES A\nNOMINEE OF A PARTY, THERE IS A PROTECTIVE PRESS POOL AROUND\nTHEM LIKE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nIT'S A SMALL GROUP OF REPORTERS, ONE FROM THE BROADCAST, ONE FROM\nTHE WIRES AND ONE FROM THE PRINT ORGANIZATION.\nTHEY WERE, IN FACT, NOT INFORMED AS TO HER WHEREABOUTS.\nTHEY, YOU KNOW, IT'S A CONSTANT STRUGGLE, NOT UNIQUE TO THIS\nCAMPAIGN AT ALL. THIS POOL IS NOT ALWAYS RIGHT\nWITH THE CANDIDATE. THAT'S OUR REQUEST AND OUR HOPE,\nBUT THE REALITY IS, WE ARE OFTEN LEFT BEHIND HERE.\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN DID RUSH TO PUT OUT A CAMPAIGN AT THE TOP OF\nTHE BROADCAST, AS YOU KNOW, TO CLARIFY THAT, YOU KNOW, SHE IS\nOKAY AND WAS FEELING OVERHEATED. I DO THINK IN THE COMING DAYS,\nTHIS IS GOING TO, YOU KNOW, KEEP PLAYING OUT.\nIT'S ON THE COVER OF THE NATIONAL INQUIRER THIS WEEK.\nI SAW A COPTY OF IT LAST NIGHT AT THE SUPERMARKET.\nAGAIN, WE DO NOT FOLLOW UP ON -- >> THEY HAD THAT HORRIBLE --\nLET'S BE HONEST, THERE'S A HORRIBLE PHOTO.\nCLEARLY, HILLARY WAS PHOTO SHOPPED IN THE PICTURE.\nI THOUGHT IT WAS DISGUSTING. THERE'S CONSPIRACY THEORIES\nSAYING SHE IS SECRETLY ILL, SUGGESTING SHE IS ON HER DEATH\nBED, WHICH SHE IS NOT. THERE ARE\n>> IT IS A DISTINCTION. LIKE I SAID, SHE'S RELEASED MORE\nINFORMATION THAN DONALD TRUMP HAS.\nBUT BOTH OF THEM HAVE RELEASED FAR LESS THAN JOHN McCAIN DID\nAND BARACK OBAMA DID, THAN MITT ROMNEY DID, GOING BEYOND THAT.\nBUT THE PICTURE ON THE TABLOID LOOKED DOCTORED.\nTHAT LOOKED NOTHING LIKE HER. AND SHE HAS JOKED ABOUT IT.\nWE SAW HER A COUPLE WEEKS AGO SAYING THEY PREDICTED I WOULD BE\nON MY DEATH BED BY OCTOBER AND I'M STILL HERE.\nSHE'S MADE HUMOR OF THIS. THIS COULD GO ONE OF TWO WAYS\nHERE. IF HER CRITICS KEEP THIS UP AND\nCRITICIZE HER, THIS COULD MOTE VIOLENT AND INSPIRE.\nWE SEE HER WAVING. SHE'S SCHEDULED TO GO TO\nCALIFORNIA TOMORROW. SHE WILL BE ON THE WEST COAST\nFOR THREE DAYS THIS WEEK. AS OF NOW, HER SCHEDULE IS GOING\nFORWARD HERE. BUT YOU HAVE TO WONDER IF THE\nCAMPAIGN MAY FEEL SOME COMPUNCTION TO PUT OUT MORE\nINFORMATION ON HER HEALTH SIMPLY TO MOVE ON WITH THIS.\nSHE HAS COMPLAINED OF ALLERGIES. WE HEARD HER COUGHING SPELL.\nIT IS ALLERGY SEASON, BUT THIS IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT\nLIKELY WILL NOT GO AWAY IN THE COMING DAYS.\n>> REPORTEDLY ON THE WAY TO HER HOME.\nWE'LL STAY ON IT.",

AND CHARLIE SAYING, HE HAD TO DO\nIT. >> BUT DID HE HAVE TO DO IT?\nTHAT WAS THE KEY QUESTION. AND THE PROSECUTION SAID NO.\nTHIS WAS NO JUSTIFIABLE HOMICIDE.\nTHIS WAS AN EXECUTION. IN FACT, THE WEAPON, THE\n12-GAUGE REMINGTON SHOTGUN, HAD BEEN PURCHASED JUST FOR THE\nKILLING, SAID THE PROSECUTOR.

CHARLIE WAS PLANNING A MURDER.\nIN FACT, BEFORE HE GOT THE FRIEND TO BUY THE WEAPON,\nSURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE SHOWED HOW INTENT HE WAS ON GETTING ONE.\nHOURS EARLIER, THERE WAS CHARLIE.\n>> CHARLIE TAN IS ON VIDEO GOING INTO THE WALMART, ATTEMPTING TO\nPURCHASE THE SHOTGUN.

FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED, IT HAD\nBEEN A LONG ROAD, AND THERE WAS A NEW TRIAL PENDING.\nBUT THERE WAS ANOTHER STUNNER IN STORE.\nHERE WITH THE CONCLUSION OF \"HOUSE OF SECRETS\" IS DENNIS\nMURPHY. >> THE JUDGE IN THE TAN MURDER\nCASE DECLARES A MISTRIAL. >> EVEN THOUGH THE CASE WAS OVER\nFOR NOW, THE CHARLIE TAN MISTRIAL WAS BIG NEWS IN\nROCHESTER. >> THEY COULD NOT COME TO A\nCONSENSUS REGARDING THE MURDER CHARGE.\n>> EVERYONE WAS TALKING TO THE MEDIA INCLUDING JUDGE PIAMPIANO\nWHO WAS RUNNING FOR STATE SUPREME COURT AND SPOKE TO OUR\nAFFILIATE. >> WOULD YOU BE PRESIDING AS\nJUDGE AGAIN? >> I BELIEVE I WOULD BECAUSE THE\nCASE HAS BEEN ASSIGNED TO ME. THAT'S THE NORMAL PROTOCOL.\n>> THE LAWYERS ON BOTH SIDES SHARED THOUGHTS ABOUT DOING IT\nALL OVER AGAIN. >> ITS A MURDER CHARGE.\nIT'S NOT A PETTY LARCENY CHARGE WITH A HUNG JURY.\nWE RECOGNIZE THE D.A.'s OFFICE ISN'T GOING TO WALK AWAY FROM A\nHOMICIDE. >> FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE, HOW\nWILL THE NEW TRIAL LOOK DIFFERENTLY?\n>> BETTER FOR ME. >> UNFORTUNATELY FOR CHARLIE'S\nATTORNEYS, THEY HAD ALREADY PLAYED THEIR SURPRISE DEFENSE.\nMOM REALLY DID IT. THERE WOULD BE NO SHOCK VALUE IN\nA SECOND TRIAL. >> FRANKLY, WE'VE GOT FACE THIS\nLIKE IT'S A BRAND-NEW CASE STARTING TODAY.\nHUNG JURIES ARE A SITUATION IN WHICH YOU HAVE TO REINVENT THE\nWHEEL. >> IN NOVEMBER OF 2015, WEEKS\nAFTER THE TRIAL ENDED, BOTH SIDES WERE BACK IN THE SAME\nCOURT BEFORE THE SAME JUDGE.

WILL NOT BE PROSECUTED\nBECAUSE THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANY EVIDENCE TO SHOW SHE IS\nRESPONSIBLE FOR THE MURDER. >> COULD IT HAVE BEEN THE\nMOTHER. >> YOU KNOW, I LOOK AT A\n.12-GAUGE SHOTGUN.

              "text": "JEFF ZELENY, THANK YOU.\n>>> TODAY IS THE 15th ANNIVERSARY OF THE SEPTEMBER\n11th ATTACKS. AMERICANS GATHERED TO REFLECT\nAND REMEMBER. READ THE NAMES OF THE DEAD AT\nGROUND ZERO. ALMOST 3,000 OF THEM.\nTHE PRESIDENT HONORED VICTIMS IN A CEREMONY AT THE PENTAGON AND\nIN PENNSYLVANIA BELLS RANG TO REMEMBER THE PASSENGERS AND\nCREW, THOSE HEROIC MEN AND WOMEN.\nIT'S AN INTENSE EMOTIONAL DAY FOR ALL AMERICANS AND THE\nGATHERINGS THROUGH THE TOP OFFICIALS.\nGROUND SZERO, TWO NEW YORKERS CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP ARRIVED\nTO PAY RESPECTS. THAT WAS BEFORE CLINTON LEFT THE\nCEREMONY AFTER BEING OVERHEATED. WITH US NOW TO TALK ABOUT\nNATIONAL SECURITY IS A FORMER ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE CIA.\nHE'S SUPPORTING HILLARY CLINTON NOW.\nTHANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. WE APPRECIATE IT.\nDO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH?\nYOU'RE NOT A CAMPAIGN PERSON BUT YOU HAVE ENDORSED HER.\n>> ONE IS I WAS WITH HER ON FRIDAY AT A NATIONAL SECURITY\nSESSION IN NEW YORK. SHE LOOKED FANTASTIC U.\nSHE HAD HIGH ENERGY. THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY IS\nTHERE ARE TIMES IN ALL OF OUR LIVES WHERE WE DON'T FEEL WELL.\nI MISSED SOME OF THE BRIEFINGS AFTER 9/11 BECAUSE I WASN'T\nFEELING WELL. LET'S NOT MAKE MORE OF THIS THAN\nTHERE IS. >> I WANT TO MOVE ON.\nI WANT TO TALK ABOUT ONE OTHER THING WHICH IS HILLARY CLINTON\nAT A FUNDRAISER REFERRING TO HALF OF DONALD TRUMP EEGS\nSUPPORTERS AS BEING IN A BASKET OF DEPLORABLES.\nSHE SAID THAT SHE REGRETS NOW SAYING HALF, BUT LET'S PLAY THAT\nSOUND IF WE CAN. >> JUST BE GROSSLY GENERAL ISTI,\nYOU COULD PUT HALF OF TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS INTO THE BASKET OF\nDEPLORABLES. RACIST, SEXIST, HOMOPHOBIC,\nISLAM PHOBIC, YOU NAME IT. >> SHE'S SINCE SAID SHE REGRETS\nSAYING HALF, BUT SHE MAINTAINS THAT DONALD TRUMP DOES HAVE THE\nSUPPORTERS WHO ARE DEPLORABLE. IT'S A PRETTY, AS SHE SAID\nHERSELF A GROSS GENERALIZATION TO DESCRIBE MILLIONS OF\nAMERICANS THAT WAY. >> I'LL LET WHAT E SHE SAID\nSTAND. SHE SAID SHE REGRETS SAYING IT.\nI'LL LEAVE IT THERE. >> ARE YOU TROUBLED AT ALL IN\nTHE SAME WAY SHE SEEMS TO BE? >> I THINK THERE'S SOME PEOPLE\nWHO ARE SUPPORTING HIM BECAUSE OF THE THINGS HE HAS SAID.\nAND I WORRY ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE TOO.\nSO I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT. >> I WANT TO TALK ABOUT NATIONAL\nSECURITY ISSUES, WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY WHY YOU'RE HERE.\nI WOULD ALSO NOTE AND I KNOW I DON'T HAVE TO REMIND YOU THIS IN\nADDITION TO BEING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE SEPTEMBER\n11th ATTACKS IN 2001, IT'S ALSO THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE THE\nBENGHAZI ATTACKS IN WHICH WE LOST FOUR BRAVE AMERICANS.\nYOU WERE AT THE CIA AT THE TIME. WHAT LESSONS WOULD YOU SAY YOU\nLEARNED FROM THAT DAY? >> I THINK THE KEY LESSON, AND I\nTHINK THIS HAS BEEN LOST ALL THE WAY AROUND, ALL ALONG, THIS\nWHOLE EPISODE, IS THAT BECAUSE VIOLENT EXTREMISM, THE IDEOLOGY\nHAS SPREAD SO FAR IN PLACES LIKE LIBYA AND PLACES LIKE SYRIA AND\nIRAQ AND YEMEN WHERE WE MIGHT HAVE FACILITIES WE HAVE TO\nPROTECT THEM AS IF THEY ARE WAR ZONES.\nAND THAT MEANS RINGING THEM WITH SECURITY, THAT MEANS HAVING THE\nKIND OF INTELLIGENCE YOU HAVE ON THE GROUND IN A WAR ZONE TO\nPROTECT YOURSELF FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO ATTACK YOU.\nTHAT'S THE MAIN LESSON LEARNED. >> IS THERE ALSO A LESSON, A LOT\nOF PEOPLE CRITICIZE UED THE WHITE HOUSE FOR BEING FOCUSED ON\nTHE NARRATIVE THIS WASN'T A TERRORIST ATTACK.\nTHIS WAS BECAUSE OF THE ANTI-MUSLIM VIDEO.\nALSO A A LESSON IN MAKING SURE THAT WHITE HOUSE IS TRANSPARENT\nABOUT WHAT HAPPENS AND DOESN'T GET SWEPT UP IN A POLITICAL\nNARRATIVE? >> TWO THINGS.\nONE IS THERE IS NO DICHOTOMY BETWEEN THE VIDEO POSSIBLE CAUSE\nING THE ATTACK AND IT BEING A TERRORIST ATTACK.\n. IT CAN BE BOTH OF THOSE THINGS.\nTHAT'S BEEN LOST ON A LOT OF PEOPLE.\nTHE ONLY GUY WHOSE BEEN ARRESTED AND BROUGHT TO JUSTICE FOR THIS\nATTACK TOLD THE FBI THAT ONE OF THE TWO REASONS E HE CONDUCTED\nTHE ATTACK WAS BECAUSE OF THE VIDEO.\nSO THERE'S THIS IDEA THAT ONE OF THE GUYS SAID IT WAS THE VIDEO.\nSO IN TERMS OF THE POLITICS OF THIS FOR ME THE LESSON IS WHEN\nIT BECOMES POLITICAL, GET ALL THE INFORMATION OUT THERE SAZ\nFAST AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN. THAT'S THE POLITICAL LESSON FOR\nME. >> YOU HAVE A SCATHING OP-ED IN\n\"THE WASHINGTON POST\" THIS WEEKEND WRITTEN ALONGSIDE YOUR\nFELLOW NATIONAL SECURITY EXPERT. >> MIKE VICKERS.\n>> FORMERLY WITH WHOM YOU USED TO WORK.\nTHEN YOU'D ALSO WRITTEN ONE IN THE \"NEW YORK TIMES\" PREVIOUSLY\nIN WHICH YOU SUGGESTED THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS AN UNWITTING\nAGENT OF VLADIMIR PUTIN AND THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION.\nARE YOU BEING FACETIOUS THERE OR DO YOU REALLY THINK HE'S BEEN\nDUPE D BY VLADIMIR PUTIN? >> I'M NOT BEING FACETIOUS AT\nALL. I THINK VLADIMIR PUTIN CONSIDERS\nHIM AN UNWITTING AGENT. THAT'S SOMETHING WHO DOES WHAT\nYOU WANT THEM TO DO WITHOUT THEM KNOWING YOU'RE DOING IT ON THEIR\nBEHALF. PUTIN PLAYED TO TRUMP BY TELLING\nTRUMP WHAT HE WANTED TO HEAR, WHICH IS I'M A GREAT GUY, I'M\nSMARTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE, I'M A GREAT PERSON.\nPUTIN PLAYED TO THAT. HE'S A TRAINED INTELLIGENCE\nOFFICER. HE KNOWS HOW TO PLAY U TO\nPEOPLE. WHAT WAS THE RESULT?\nDONALD TRUMP IN TURN PRAISING VLADIMIR PUTIN.\nDONALD TRUMP SAYING THAT WE MIGHT NOT DEFEND THEB BALTICES.\nIT MIGHT BE O OKAY THAT PUTIN GRABBED CRIMEA.\nDONALD TRUMP IS A GREAT LEADER. ALL OF THAT PLAYS RIGHT INTO\nPUTIN'S HANDS. SO ABSOLUTELY I THINK PUTIN SEES\nHIM AS AN UNWITTING AGENT. >> HILLARY CLINTON SAID\nSOMETHING ABOUT VLADIMIR PUTIN TELLING CHRIS CUOMO THAT\nVLADIMIR PUTIN HAS TRIED TO DISRUPT ELECTIONS HERE IN THE\nUNITED STATES. I U KNOW THAT SOME\nCOUNTERTERRORISM OFFICIALS BELIEVE THAT SOME OF THE HACKS\nTHE DNC ONE IN PARTICULAR WERE DONE BY RUSSIAN HACKERS.\nIS THERE ACTUAL EVIDENCE THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN IS TRYING TO\nDISRUPT THIS ELECTION? >> I HAVE NOT SEEN THE EVIDENCE.\nI'M NOT IN THE GOVERNMENT ANYMORE.\nI'M NOT IN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY.\nBUT PUTIN HAS A LONG TRACK RECORD OF INTERFERING IN THE\nELECTIONS OF THE COUNTRIES AROUND RUSSIA AND FORMER SOVIET\nUN UNION.\nUSING CYBER OPERATIONS, INFORMATION OPERATIONS, PAYING\nPOLITICAL PARTIES, HE'S DONE SOME OF THAT IN WESTERN EUROPE.\nI BELIEVE THAT HE IS BEHIND THE HACK OF THE DNC.\nI BELIEVE THAT HE HAS GIVEN THOSE E-MAILS TO WIKILEAKS AND I\nBELIEVE THERE'S A PLAN TO STRING THOSE OUT TO MAKE HER LOOK BAD.\nHE WANTS DONALD TRUMP TO WIN THIS ELECTION.\nIN PART BECAUSE OF THE ROMANCE BETWEEN THE TWO.\nAND IN PART BECAUSE PUTIN DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT HILLARY CLINTON\nWILL BE EASY ON RUSSIA. >> CAN PUTIN AND/OR THESE\nRUSSIAN HACKERS WHO YOU'RE SUGGESTING ANSWERED TO HIM, CAN\nHE ACTUALLY AFFECT THE ELECTION NOT JUST IN TERMS OF THE\nPROPAGANDA OR MATERIALS OR E E-MAILS BUT IN CHANGE ING THE\nRESULTS OF THE ELECTION. >> HE MIGHT THINK HE CAN HAVE AN\nKMALKT, BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S POSSIBLE.\n>> IN 2012 WHEN MITT ROMNEY SAID U THAT RUSSIA WAS THE NATION'S\nNUMBER ONE GEOPOLITICAL FOE AND THEY MOCKED HIM FOR IT, I THINK\nTHAT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT ROMNEY WAS RIGHT AND THE GENERALS ALL\nSAY RUSSIA IS THE NUMBER ONE GEOPOLITICAL FOE.\nI THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WATCHING THINK -- YOU\nWEREN'T SAYING THAT IN 2012. BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GETTING\nWHIPLASH. THEY ARE SAYING NOW RUSSIA IS\nOUR NUMBER ONE FOE. FOUR YEARS AGO THE MEDIA WAS\nMOCKING REPUBLICANS FOR SAYING THAT.\n>> I I WOULDN'T SAY RUSSIA IS THE NUMBER ONE FOE.\nCOUNTERTERRORISM, TOP OF THE LIST.\nNORTH KOREA, RUSSIA, CHINA, THEY ARE ALL IN A GROUP AT THE TOP.\nRUSSIA HAS BEEN AN ADVERSARY FOR A LONG TIME.\nSOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN IN THE INTELLIGENCE BUSINESS KNOWS\nTHAT. THEY NEVER STOPPED PLAY ING THE\nINTELLIGENCE GAME. THIS IS A BAD GUY.\nTHIS IS A THUG AND A BULLY. S THAT GUY WHO ONLY UNDERSTANDS\nRELATIVE POWER. THIS IS A GUY THAT DOESN'T\nBELIEVE IT'S POSSIBLE TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE A NEGOTIATION.\nTHIS IS A GUY WHO IF HE PUNCHES YOU IN THE FACE, YOU HAVE TO\nPUNCH HIM BACK IN THE FACE. >> IT'S A PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU\nON THE SHOW. >> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.\n>> I HOPE IT'S A MEANINGFUL DAY FOR YOU.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH. STAY WITH US.\nFOR THE LATEST ON HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH, WE'LL HAVE A\nLIVE REPORT AFTER THE BREAK. STAY WITH US.",

WE'RE GOING TO BRING BACKSOMETH\nNOT HAD IN A LONG, LONG TIME. WE'RE GOING TO START WINNING\nAGAIN. THE HISTORY BOOK IS CLOSING ON\nTHE FAILED POLITICIANS OF YESTERDAY.\nA NEW CHAPTER IS BEGINNING, AND THIS CHAPTER WILL BE AUTHORED BY\nYOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. NOT ME, YOU.\nTHIS WILL BE YOUR TIME. YOU WILL BE RUNNING THE SHOW.\nTHIS IS A MOVEMENT LIKE THEY'VE NEVER SEEN.\nTHE SHOW IS BEGINNING. HILLARY CLINTON -- AND YOU CAN\nSEE THAT FROM THOSE E-MAILS. [ AUDIENCE BOOING ]\nIS A VERY DISHONEST CANDIDATE OF THE PAST.\nOURS IS THE CAMPAIGN OF THE FUTURE.\nIN THIS FUTURE, WE'RE GOING TO PURSUE NEW TRADE POLICIES THAT\nPUT AMERICAN WORKERS FIRST, AND WE'RE GOING TO KEEP OUR JOBS IN\nOUR COUNTRY. WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET THEM TAKE\nOUR JOBS ANYMORE, FOLKS. WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET IT\nHAPPEN. IT'S BEEN HAPPENING LONG ENOUGH.\nAND THE REASON THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT IS BECAUSE THE\nSPECIAL INTERESTS AND THE DONORS CONTROL OUR POLITICIANS, AND\nTHEY CONTROL HILLARY CLINTON. AND IT'S NEVER, EVER GOING TO\nHAPPEN. TAKE A LOOK AT NEW YORK STATE.\nWHEN SHE WAS THE SENATOR FROM NEW YORK STATE, SHE CAMPAIGNED\nBY SAYING THAT SHE WAS GOING TO BRING JOBS BACK TO NEW YORK\nSTATE. NEW YORK STATE IS A DISASTER.\n>> ALSO THIS WEEK AFTER WHINING ABOUT HOW THE MEDIA IS COVERING\nHER CAMPAIGN, HILLARY CLINTON ACTUALLY HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE\nAFTER, WHAT, 280 DAYS. TAKE A LOOK.\n>> NO CONVERSATION ABOUT OUR NATIONAL SECURITY WOULD BE\nCOMPLETE UNLESS WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE NOMINEE ON THE OTHER\nSIDE PROMISES TO DO THINGS THAT WILL MAKE US LESS SAFE.\nEVERY DAY THAT GOES BY, THIS JUST BECOMES MORE AND MORE OF A\nREALITY TELEVISION SHOW. IT'S NOT -- IT'S NOT A SERIOUS\nPRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. >> HERE WITH REACTION, TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISOR A.J. DELGADO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR\nMERCEDES SCHLAPP, AND FOREIGN CLINTON POLLSTER DOUG SCHOEN.\nA.J., I START WITH YOU. IT'S INTERESTING TO WATCH THAT\nAFTER DONALD TRUMP GOES TO BATON ROUGE AND AFTER DONALD TRUMP HAS\nA PRETTY SUCCESSFUL MEETING WITH THE MEXICAN PRESIDENT AND AFTER\nHE HAS A GOOD VALUE VOTERS SUMMIT AND AFTER HE ALSO HAS A\nGREAT TOWN HALL, IT LOOKS LIKE HILLARY CLINTON CAN'T HIDE ANY\nLONGER. DONALD TRUMP IS LOOKING PRETTY\nPRESIDENTIAL AND A LOT MORE ENERGETIC.\n>> ABSOLUTELY. YOU KNOW WHAT I FIND REMARKABLE\nABOUT THAT CLIP IS SHE CALLS HIM RECKLESS AND DANGEROUS.\nSEAN, CAN WE TAKE A LOOK AT HER FOREIGN POLICY FOR A MINUTE?\nFOUR PRONGS HERE. IRAQ, HILLARY WAS IN FAVOR OF\nIT. DONALD TRUMP WAS AGAINST IT.\nCHECK THE NEIL CAVUTO INTERVIEW FROM TWO MONTHS BEFORE THE WAR.\nSYRIA, SHE WANTS TO ESTABLISH A NO-FLY ZONE THERE.\nTHE RUSSIANS ARE ALREADY FLYING THERE, SO THAT MEANS MILITARY\nCONFLICT, POTENTIAL WAR WITH RUSSIA.\nLIBYA, SHE INVOLVED US IN THAT, TAKING DOWN GADDAFI.\nDONALD TRUMP AT THE TIME WAS CRITICAL OF IT.\nRUSSIA. WHILE TRUMP IS TRYING TO BE AND\nVERY MUCH SO PRESIDENTIAL, DIPLOMATIC IN EXTENDING THE HAND\nOF NOT NECESSARILY FRIENDSHIP, BUT ENGAGEMENT WITH A DIALOGUE\nWITH RUSSIA, JUST LIKE RONALD REAGAN DID, THESE SHOULD BE OUR\nALLIES IN FIGHTING ISIS. SHE WANTS US TO HAVE CONFLICT\nWITH RUSSIA. FOUR RECKLESS AND DANGEROUS\nPOSITIONS ON FOREIGN POLICY. >> OH, SORRY, I MADE A MISTAKE.\nI SENT YOU TO IRAQ. OOPS.\nWE GOT TO LEARN FROM IT. 5,000 DEAD AMERICANS.\nWE GOT TO LEARN FROM IT, AND NOBODY DIED IN LIBYA.\nWE GOT TO LEARN FROM THAT TOO. LET'S LOOK AT SOME OF THE POLL\nNUMBERS. TRUMP HAS HAD A GOOD MONTH NOW.\nHERE'S SOME INTERESTING POLLING NUMBERS, DOUG SHOWN.\nIF YOU LOOK AMONG HISPANICS, AFRICAN-AMERICANS, LOOK AT\nTRUMP'S NUMBER. 19%, THE BLACK COMMUNITY.\nHE'S DOING OUTREACH IN DETROIT. I THOUGHT HIS SPEECH ONE OF THE\nBEST HE EVER GAVE. THE HISPANIC NUMBER, IT'S VERY\nSTRONG. >> YEAH.\n>> IF HE GETS UP TO THE 90% NUMBER, 92% WITH REPUBLICANS AND\nHE HOLDS THESE NUMBERS, HE'S THE NEXT PRESIDENT.\n>> THAT IS TRUE. THE REASON HILLARY WENT OUT\nTODAY -- AND I THOUGHT SHE DID A GOOD JOB TODAY.\nSHE MADE IT CLEAR SHE DISAGREES WITH TRUMP ABOUT PUTIN.\nBUT THE REASON SHE'S OUT IS BECAUSE SHE IS SINKING IN THE\nPOLLS. I PUT THAT IN MY \"WALL STREET\nJOURNAL\" ARTICLE. IT'S A FACT.\nSHE HAS TO GET OUT. SHE CAN'T HIDE.\nSHE STARTED TODAY. A GOOD FIRST STEP, BUT, SEAN,\nTHIS IS A VERY CLOSE ELECTION. >> TWO PRESS CONFERENCES IN A\nWEEK. I MENTIONED THE ONE EARLIER THIS\nWEEK. NOW I MENTIONED THE ONE TODAY.\nSHE'S NOT EXACTLY GETTING HARD HITTING QUESTIONS.\nWE CAN LOOK QUINNIPIAC. IT'S 47-47 IN FLORIDA.\nNO BIG SURPRISE. IN ONE POLL, IN THE QUINNIPIAC  46-45 TRUMP IN OHIO.\nLOOK, IT'S A FIVE-POINT RACE IN PENNSYLVANIA.\nFIVE-POINT RACE IN MICHIGAN. THREE-POINT RACE IN WISCONSIN.\nHILLARY HAS GOT A LOT OF DEFENDING TO DO HERE AND MORE\nOPTIONS SEEM TO BE OPENING UP FOR TRUMP IN TERMS OF THE\nELECTORAL MAP IF THIS CONTINUES, MERCEDES.\n>> WELL, YOU KNOW, AGAIN TRUMP HAS BEEN VIEWED AS THE UNDERDOG,\nRIGHT, SEAN? SO THEN WHAT HAS HILLARY DONE?\nHILLARY HAS SPENT HER TIME ON JUST A ONE FOCUS STRATEGY, WHICH\nIS THAT SAYING TRUMP IS DANGEROUS.\nTHAT'S NOT ENOUGH BECAUSE WHAT'S HAPPENING IS TRUMP IS BEING VERY\nPROACTIVE. I MEAN JUST THIS WEEK THEY\nOUTLINED TWO SEPARATE MESSAGES. BEGINNING OF THE WEEK, IT WAS\nNATIONAL SECURITY, AMERICA FIRST, PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH\nWHERE YOU WOULD HAVE LIMITED MILITARY ENGAGEMENT AS WELL AS A\nSTRONG MILITARY. THAT'S A STRONG MESSAGE.\nTHEN AT THE END OF THE WEEK, WHAT WAS HE TALKING ABOUT,\nSCHOOL CHOICE. SOMETHING THAT'S A KITCHEN TABLE\nISSUE. IT DRAWS IN NOT ONLY\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS THAT WOULD BE INTERESTED IN THIS ISSUE,\nHISPANICS, BUT ALSO WOMEN, WHICH WE SAW IN THE LAST CNN POLL THAT\nWITH MARRIED WOMEN, HE'S ACTUALLY DOING BETTER THAN\nHILLARY CLINTON. HE'S UP 54%.\n>> SHE'S GOT ONE ETHICAL ISSUE AFTER ANOTHER.\nCLINTON FOUNDATION SELLING ACCESS, SELLING HER SOUL.\nSHE'S GOT THIS WHOLE ISSUE WITH E-MAIL THAT DOES NOT GO AWAY.\nE-MAIL MIGHT BE THE VERY REASON SHE LOSES.\nBUT THERE'S ANOTHER REASON. SHE'S NOT EXTREMELY PRINCIPLED.\nLISTEN TO HILLARY FLIP-FLOPPING ON ISSUES LIKE IMMIGRATION, AND\nTHEN I'LL PLAY HER FLIP-FLOPPING THE SUNDAY AFTER 9/11.\nIT'S THE 15th ANNIVERSARY THIS SUNDAY.\nTHE SUNDAY AFTER 9/11, SHE WAS FOR RACIAL PROFILING.\nSO LET'S SHOW HILLARY CLINTON IN ALL OF HER FLIPPING, FLOPPING,\nFLAILING. SHE'S LIKE JOHN KERRY VOTING FOR\nTHE $87 BILLION AND THEN VOTING AGAINST IT.\nWATCH THIS. >> I DO NOT THINK THAT IT IS\nEITHER APPROPRIATE TO GIVE A DRIVER'S LICENSE TO SOMEONE WHO\nIS HERE UNDOCUMENTED. >> IN 2007, YOU OPPOSED GIVING\nDRIVER'S LICENSES TO UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE.\nWHY? >> WELL, BACK THEN, IT WAS A\nSTATE-BY-STATE DETERMINATION, AND I'M HAPPY THAT MOST STATES\nHAVE UNDERSTOOD AND MOVED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.\n>> ARE YOU GOING TO CRACK DOWN ON THE SANCTUARY STATES?\n>> NO, I'M NOT, AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY.\nI'M NOT. I'M NOT BECAUSE THE REASON WAY A\nLOT OF THOSE FOLKS DO IT IN NEW YORK -- WHY DO POLICE OFFICERS\nTURN A BLIND EYE? >> BECAUSE THEY WANT THEM TO\nREPORT CRIMES. >> THEY WANT THEM TO REPORT\nCRIMES. >> THE CITY MADE A MISTAKE NOT\nTO DEPORT SOMEONE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STRONGLY FELT\nSHOULD BE DEPORTED. SO I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO SUPPORT\nFOR A CITY THAT IGNORES THE STRONG EVIDENCE THAT SHOULD BE\nACTED ON. >> I VOTED NUMEROUS TIMES WHEN I\nWAS A SENATOR TO SPEND MONEY TO BUILD A BARRIER TO TRY TO\nPREVENT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FROM COMING IN.\n>> YOU WANT A WALL, THEN? >> NO.\nWE'VE -- >> YOU SAID THAT.\n>> WELL, I VOTED FOR BORDER SECURITY, AND SOME OF IT WAS A\nFENCE. I DON'T THINK WE EVER CALLED IT\nA WALL. >> WOULD ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS BE\nCOVERED UNDER YOUR PLAN? >> ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WOULD NOT\nBE COVERED, NO. THEY WOULD NOT BE COVERED.\nI WANT TO OPEN UP THE OPPORTUNITY FOR IMMIGRANTS TO BE\nABLE TO BUY IN TO THE EXCHANGES UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.\n>> EVERYONE RECOGNIZES WE HAVE TO TIGHTEN SECURITY.\nWE HAVE TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO KEEP OUR PEOPLE SAFE.\n>> INCLUDING PROFILING, SENATOR? >> WELL, I THINK WE HAVE TO DO\nWHATEVER IT TAKES, SAM. AND I BELIEVE THAT, YOU KNOW,\nTUESDAY CHANGED EVERYTHING. TUESDAY WAS A DAY THAT AMERICA\nHAS NEVER, EVER HAD TO EXPERIENCE.\nAND I HOPE TO HEAVEN THAT WE NEVER HAVE TO AGAIN.\nBUT WE ARE IN A WAR SITUATION, AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO\nTHINGS THAT PEOPLE DO IN TIMES OF WAR.\n>> SHE WAS WRONG. SHE ADMITTED IT.\nLET'S GO THROUGH THIS. SHE ADMITTED THIS WEEK HER VOTE\nTO SEND KIDS TO IRAQ WAS WRONG. THEY DIED BECAUSE OF HER\nDECISION. NOW SHE WAS FOR PROFILING, DOUG.\nSHE WAS FOR DRIVER'S LICENSES BEFORE SHE WAS AGAINST DRIVER'S\nLICENSES, FOR SNKS CITIES, AGAINST SANCTUARY CITIES.\nFOR THE WALL, AGAINST THE WALL. COVERAGE FOR HEALTH CARE FOR\nILLEGALS, AGAINST COVERAGE FOR HEALTH CARE.\n>> RIGHT. >> THEN SHE SAID, I WON'T USE\nTHE WORD ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS EVEN THOUGH SHE'S USED THE WORD\nILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. DOES SHE HAVE ANY CORE AT ALL OR\nIS IT ALL POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY? IS THERE A CORE?\n>> I THINK WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS SHE IS PLAYING POLITICS NOW\nBECAUSE SHE -- >> SHE DOESN'T HAVE A CORE.\n>> SHE HAS THREE STATES THAT MATTER.\nTHAT'S WHAT MATTERS TO HER. THAT'S HER CORE.\nWISCONSIN, MICHIGAN, PENNSYLVANIA.\nSHE IS GOING TO RUN A TOUGH NEGATIVE CAMPAIGN ON TRUMP\nBECAUSE -- >> TRUMP'S A RACIST, SEXIST --\n>> I DON'T THINK HE'S A RACIST. >> NO, SHE'S GOING TO SAY IT.\nHER CAMPAIGN ALREADY IS. >> A CLEAR WORLD VIEW THAT IS\nMALLEABLE. >> SO BASICALLY SHE HAS NO CORE,\nA.J. SHE HAS NO CORE.\n>> MALLEABLE? IS THAT THE WORD, DOUG?\n>> MALLEABLE. >> HOW IS THAT EVEN THE SAME\nPERSON? YOU WATCH THAT CLIP.\nBY THE WAY, SHE'S LYING. I HEARD HER SAY I TALKED ABOUT A\nFENCE. I NEVER MENTIONED A WALL.\nTHAT'S A LIE. LOOK IT UP, 2006.\nSHE LITERALLY SAID THE WORD WALL, THAT A WALL IN SOME PLACES\nWOULD BE APPROPRIATE. SHE'S NOT ONLY A FLIP-FLOPPER,\nSHE LIES ABOUT THE FLIP-FLOPPING.\nTHIS IS INSANE. HOW IS SHE EVEN QUALIFIED TO\nRUN? THIS SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED.\n>> MERCEDES, YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE LAST WORD HERE.\n>> THERE'S A PHRASE IN SPANISH THAT A.J. WILL UNDERSTAND.\n[ SPEAKING SPANISH ] ENOUGH ALREADY.\nFOR HILLARY CLINTON, IT'S ALL ABOUT POLITICAL CONVENIENCE.\nTHE SAME WAY IT WAS CONVENIENT FOR HER TO USE 15,000\nBLACKBERRIES AND iPADS THAT WERE DESTROYED BY A HAMMER.\nLET'S GET REAL PEOPLE. >> DON'T FORGET BLEACHBIT.\nTHAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. >> $2 BILLION FROM THE CLINTONS\nTO MAKE THIS ALL GO AWAY. >> YOU MEAN LIKE WITH A CLOTH?\nNO. THEY USED BLEACHBIT SO THAT GOD\nCOULDN'T READ IT AND JESUS COULDN'T READ IT.\nGOOD TO SEE YOU ALL. >> THANK YOU.\n>> THANK YOU.",

NOT ALL DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTERS\nARE BIGOTS. HOWEVER, THEY DO HAVE TO BE OKAY\nWITH SUPPORTING A BIGOT. I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT\nCONNOTATION. >> LET ME PLAY DEVIL'S ADDS VO\nINDICATE. THERE ARE A LOT OF DEPLORABLE\nTHING BEING SAID ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND AT EVENTS.\nYOU HAVE SEEN THE SHIRTS THAT SAY THINGS THAT I CANT EVEN SAY.\nTRUMP THAT \"B\" WORD. THERE ARE HORRIFIC THINGS WE SEE\nAT THOSE EVENTS. >> LET ME SAY THIS.\nI DON'T CARE WHAT THE TITLE IS OR WHETHER IT'S A REPUBLICAN OR\nDEMOCRAT. I DON'T WANT MY PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATES PUTTING PEOPLE IN BASKETS.\nI WILL TELL YOU NOT 47% OF THE PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT WHO\nSUPPORT DONALD TRUMP ARE RACISTS OR BIGOTS.\nAND I THINK IT'S DEPLORABLE FOR SOMEONE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO\nSTART OUT BY SAY FIGURE YOU DON'T AGREE WITH ME, YOU'RE A\nBIGOT OR A RACIST. THAT'S WHAT SHE'S SAYING.\nI'M INSULT ED BY THAT. AND I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\nWILL BE INSULTED BY THAT. >> SHE SAID HALF AND THEN TOOK\nIT BACK. BUT I DIDN'T MAKE THE COMMENTS.\nI'M NOT GOING TO DEFEND THEM. TAKE A WELLISTEN TO GOVERNOR MI\nPENCE CAPITALIZING AND TALKING ABOUT THESE REMARKS.\n>> THEY ARE NOT A BASKET OF ANYTHING.\nTHEY ARE AMERICANS AND THEY DESERVE YOUR RESPECT.\nI HAVE NOT HEARD THAT LEVEL OF DISDAIN FOR AMERICANS I CAN'T\nEVEN REPEAT. SINCE BARACK OBAMA DESCRIBED\nPEOPLE THAT OPPOSED HIM AS PEOPLE WHO CLING TO THEIR GUNS\nAND RELIGION. >> WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE\nREMARKS? >> I THOUGHT IT WAS A GAFFE FOR\nSHEER. IT'S NEVER GOOD.\n>> SHE REGRETS SAYING HALF. I THINK IT WOULD BE RIGHT TO SAY\nTHERE'S A DISTURBING PERCENTAGE. THERE'S A LARGER PERCENTAGE THAN\nNORMAL OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS WHO SAY SEXIST THINGS AND I THINK\nIT'S DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE HAVE SEEN FROM OTHER REPUBLICAN\nNOMINEES. THE PEOPLE HE'S BROUGHT OUT.\n>> I DON'T MEAN TO DISAGREE WITH KIRSTEN.\nE WE PUT THAT ON HIS SUPPORTERS, BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DONALD\nTRUMP. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMEBODY WHO\nLITERALLY PAUL RYAN SAID HIS COMMENTS AB THE JUDGE WERE\nRACIST. THEN LAST WEEK THIS IS MY ISSUE,\nJUST LAST WEEK HE SAID ALL AFRICAN-AMERICANS, LIVING IN BAD\nCONDITIONS, SCHOOLS ARE BAD, YOU MAY WALK DOWN THE STREET AND GET\nSHOT. WE CLASSIFY THAT AS OUTREACH.\n>> SHE'S NOT CRITICIZING DONALD TRUMP.\nTHAT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE\nAVERAGE SUPPORTERS WHO AREN'T RACISTS.\nI DON'T THINK IT'S GOOD FOR A CANDIDATE.\nAND POSSIBLE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO BE DISPARAGING\nAMERICAN VOTERS AS A MATTER OF POLITICS.\n>> LET ME SHOW YOU A TWEET THAT I NOEXED.\nIT'S THE FACES OF THE STARS HAVE BEEN REPLACED WITH PEOPLE SUCH\nAS DONALD TRUMP AND THE TRUMP SONS AND THEN DAVID DUKE ON THE\nFAR RIGHT AND DAVID DUKE QUOTED IS A CODE WORD FOR ANTI-WHITE.\nDAVID DUKE IS E DEPLORABLE. >> ABSOLUTELY.\nI CAN TELL YOU THIS. I SUPPORTED DONALD TRUMP WAY\nBACK WHEN. AND I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE BECOME\nTHE DIVIDED STATES OF AMERICA. I DON'T REMEMBER A POLITICAL\nCANDIDATE GETTING INTO THIS MUCH NEGATIVITY.\nI U HOPE CANDIDATES WILL TALK MORE ABOUT POLICIES.\nTHE FOLKS I'M TALKING TO WANT TO KNOW WHAT EACH CANDIDATE IS\nGOING TO DO TO IMPROVE THEIR LIVES.\nIT'S ALT DELETE. CHANGE THE WHOLE PROCESS AND\nTHEY ARE FED UP. THEY REALLY ARE.\nSO THIS IS BIGGER THAN HER TAKING A SHOT OR HIM TAKING A\nSHOT. I THINK HE HAS SO MANY\nATTRIBUTES HE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT\nHILLARY. I WANT TO SEE HIM MOVE IN THAT\nDIRECTION. >> I WANT TO ADD TO THAT.\nI'M A MOTHER OF THREE AND GRANDMOTHER OF SIX.\nI HAVE TAUGHT MY CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN WE DON'T CALL\nPEOPLE NAMES. THAT E WE ALLOW THEM TO TALK\nABOUT WHAT THEY BELIEVE IN. WE RESPECT WHAT THEY BELIEVE IN.\nAND I THINK FOR A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, THEY NEED TO GET AWAY\nFROM CALLING NAMES ON BOTH SIDES.\nTHIS IS ABOUT TEACHING OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN\nOF HOW TO ACT, HOW TO HAVE A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER\nPEOPLE THAT DISAGREE WITH YOU AND GET AWAY FROM THE NAMES.\nLET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT IT IS THAT WE DISAGREE ABOUT.\nWE CAN HAVE STRONG DISAGREEMENTS ON THIS, BUT I DON'T LIKE\nCALLING PEOPLE NAMES. >> I E AGREE, BUT ANOTHER PART\nANT BEING A LEADER AND SOMETHING I HAVE BEEN BEGGING THE\nREPUBLICAN PARTY AND DONALD TRUMP TO DO IS THAT, YES, THERE\nARE FACTIONS OF DEPLORABLES. I DON'T HAVE MUCH RESPECT FOR\nBIGOTS -- I DON'T HAVE MUCH RESPECT FOR BIGOTS.\nAND FOR PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY -- FOR HIM TO EMBRACE THAT AT\nCERTAIN POINTS, I WAS BACKSTAGE ONSET IS WHEN JAKE TAPPER ASKED\nHIM MULTIPLE TIMES ABOUT DAVID DUKE.\nHE EMBRACED THAT. AND ALL I'M ASKING IS I AGREE\nWITH YOU ABOUT NAME CALLING. BUT THERE'S A CERTAIN POINT\nWHERE YOU HAVE TO TAKE LEADERSHIP AND SAY THAT'S NOT\nWHAT THIS KCOUNTRY IS BUILT UPO. THE PEOPLE WHO WEAR CONFEDERATE\nFLAG T-SHIRTS AT THE RALLY, THAT PET RI U IF IS IF IS ME.\nTHAT'S NOT WHAT OUR COUNTRY IS ABOUT.\n>> I WILL E AGREE THEY DON'T LIKE IT WHEN FOLKS IN MY OWN\nPARTY CALL ONE ANOTHER NAMES. AND ESPECIALLY WHEN E WE GET ON\nTHE NATIONAL SCENE WHERE WE HAVE CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN\nWATCHING THIS AND SAYING LOOK AT THESE LEADERS CALLING EACH OTHER\nNAMES. HOW CAN I SAY WHEN THEYMY\nGRANDCHILD GETS CALLED TO THE OFFICE FOR CALLING A NAME WHEN\nTHEY CAN POINT TO THE LEAD ERS OF OUR COUNTRY.\nLET'S NOT PUT PEOPLE IN BASKETS. LET'S MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.\nTHAT WAS NOT THE THING YOU WERE TO DO IS CALL PEOPLE NAMES.\nYES, I MIGHT DISAGREE WITH YOU, BUT LET'S DISAGREE.\n>> THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE ECONOMY IS GOING TO DO.\nTHEY WANT TO KNOW IF THEY ARE GOING TO BE SAFE IN THEIR OWN\nCOUNTRY. SO MUCH OF THE WHOLE DISCUSSION\nNOW IS ABOUT HOW BAD THE OTHER CANDIDATE IS.\nI WANT PEOPLE TO BE EXCITED BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING OUT TO E\nVOTE FOR A BUSINESSMAN WHO WILL BE SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT\nTHAN WHAT WASHINGTON HAS SEEN IN DECADES OF WHERE THE DIRECTION\nOF THE COUNTRY GOES. >> IT WOULD BE NICE TO COVER A\nMORE PLEASANT RACE.

I THINK YOU HOLD BOTH OF THESE\nCANDIDATES ACCOUNTABLE. AT THE SAME TIME, DONALD TRUMP,\nBECAUSE HE HAS BEEN SO RACIALLY DIVISIVE, SO OFFENSIVE TO SO\nMANY OF THESE GROUPS, WE HAVE ALMOST BECOME KIND OF NUMB TO\nIT. WE REPORT ON IT.\nHE'S STILL IN THE 40s. HE CAN'T GET TO THE 50s.\nWITH HILLARY CLINTON, IF SHE MAKES ONE MISTAKE VERSUS HIS 20\nMISTAKES IT SEEMS LIKE THE WORLD COMES DOWN ON HER SHOULDERS.\nWE ALMOST TOLERATE AND HAVE COME TO KNOW THAT DONALD IS GOING TO\nMAKE THESE OUTRAGEOUS STATEMENTS AS PART OF THIS PRESIDENTIAL\nCAMPAIGN THAT MAKES IT UNIQUE. >> WE WOULD ABSOLUTELY TRADE\nPRESS TREATMENT IMMEDIATELY IF YOU THINK THAT THERE IS A BIAS.\nWE WOULD ABSOLUTELY TRADE THE PRESS TREATMENT WITH YOU.\nBUT THE REALITY IS HERE'S SOMEONE WHO CLAIMS SHE WANTS TO\nUNITE AMERICA, AND SHE CALLS MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE\nRACIST, SEXIST, HOMOPHOBES.",

IS THAT AN APOLOGY?\nAND COULD THAT COST HER VOTES? >> Reporter: WELL, IT DOESN'T\nSEEM LIKE IT'S AN APOLOGY. AS WE SAW YESTERDAY TIM KAINE\nSAYING HE DIDN'T THINK SHE NEEDED TO APOLOGIZE.\nREGARDING WHETHER OR NOT IT WILL COST HER IN POLLS, I SAW THREE\nMAIN REACTIONS WHEN TALKING TO VOTERS ABOUT IT YESTERDAY.\nONE, THERE WERE PEOPLE HIGHLIGHTING HOW QUICKLY SHE DO\nTHE BEST TRACK RECORD. SECONDLY, I SAW PEOPLE WHO AGREE\nWITH FORMER SECRETARY CLINTON AND BELIEVE THAT THE DONALD\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS CREATED A SAFER SPACE FOR PEOPLE WHO\nDISCRIMINATE AGAINST OTHER PEOPLE BASED ON RACE AND\nRELIGION AND GENDER IN WAYS THAT WE HAVE NEVER SEEN IN A\nPRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.

THIS IS THE LATEST AND NEWEST\nCOMING FROM THE DEMOCRATIC POTENTIAL CANDIDATE.\nI ALSO WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE CONTROVERSY OVER HIS APPEARANCE\nWITH FORMER CNN HOST LARRY KING. TRUMP SAID HE AGREED TO BE PART\nOF A PODCAST BUT THAT ENDED UP AIRING ON A RUSSIAN NETWORK,\nRUSSIA TODAY. ALL OF THAT IS CALLING INTO\nQUESTION WHETHER TRUMP IS COZYING UP TO THE KREMLIN.\n>> Reporter: YES. THIS IS THE SECOND TIME IN DAYS\nTHAT DONALD TRUMP HAS ATTRACTED ATTENTION FOR SPEAKING SOMEWHAT\nFAVORABLY OF PUTIN. YOU MAY RECALL A FEW DAYS BEFORE\nHE PARTICIPATED IN A FORUM AT NBC WHERE HE CALLED PUTIN A\nSTRONG LEADER. PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN VERY\nFRUSTRATED WITH SOME OF THE POLICIES AND THE ROLE THAT PUTIN\nSEEKS TO PLAY IN THE WORLD GLOB\nGLOBALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY DONALD TRUMP HASN'T BEEN\nCRITICAL OF PUTIN. THEY WONDER IF HE WILL PIVOT AND\nSPEAK OUT AGAINST PUTIN OR IF WE WILL SEE MORE FAVORABLE\nLANGUAGE. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE\nSIGNIFICANCE OF TODAY, 9/11, TWO CANDIDATES, CLINTON AND TRUMP.\nNEW YORK IS AT THE HEART AND SOUL OF THESE INDIVIDUALS AND\nTHEIR CAMPAIGNS FOR SURE. LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW THEY ARE\nMARKING THE OCCASION. >> Reporter: YEAH, I THINK THIS\nIS THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION SINCE 9/11 WHERE THE\nTWO MAJOR PARTY CANDIDATES HAVE SUCH CLOSE PERSONAL TIES TO NEW\nYORK. AS YOU KNOW, DONALD TRUMP BUILT\nHIS BUSINESS EMPIRE IN NEW YORK AND HE IS A NATIVE NEW YORKER\nAND HILLARY CLINTON WAS THE SENATOR FROM NEW YORK DURING\nTHIS TIME AND SO WHEN WE SEE THEM BOTH SPEAK ABOUT TERRORISM\nAND HOW THAT SHAPED THEIR POLICY SINCE 9/11, WE ARE HEARING QUITE\nA FEW PERSONAL STORIES ABOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE,\nCOMMUNITY, BUSINESSES DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY IT.\nWHILE BOTH WILL BE CAMPAIGNING TODAY, I THINK WE WILL SEE THEM\nSPEAK ABOUT THIS ISSUE THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE\nCAMPAIGN. >> EUGENE SCOTT LIVE FOR US VIA\nSKYPE IN WASHINGTON.

AND SO I THINK THEY SHOULD HONOR\nTHE PLEDGES, AND I THINK THAT OUR STATE CHAIRMAN AND OUR\nCOMMITTEE PEOPLE ON THE COMMITTEE ARE GOING TO REVIEW\nTHIS SITUATION, AND THERE MAY BE CONSEQUENCES IN THE FUTURE.\nBUT, LOOK, I SAW SOME POLLING THAT SHOULD GIVE YOU A MUCH\nBETTER FEELING ABOUT THIS. THIS CNN POLL CAME OUT THIS\nWEEK, HAD A MUCH HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF REPUBLICAN SUPPORT\nFOR DONALD TRUMP. >> WHAT WAS THE PERCENTAGE OF\nTHAT POLL?

HE STOOD UP TO HER AND WHENEVER\nPEOPLE KIND OF STAND UP TO HER THEY ARE ALWAYS CALLED SEXIST,\nUNFAIR. LIKE I REMEMBER IN THE PRIMARY\nDEBATES, WHEN BERNIE -- WHICH KEPT INTERRUPTING BERNIE SANDERS\nAND HE SAID EXCUSE ME, I'M TALKING, WHICH IS VERY POLITE.\nEVERYONE WENT NUTS. LIKE THEY MADE IT SOUND LIKE HE\nHAD SAID SHUT UP, WOMAN, AND SPIT IN HER FACE.\nBASED ON THEIR REACTION. SO YOU KNOW, I HOPE THAT DOESN'T\nCONTINUE EVERY TIME ANYBODY TRIES TO HOLD HER ACCOUNTABLE.\n>> LIKE THE MEDIA'S LOSING THEIR HEAD OVER HOW HILLARY WAS\nTREATED, LIKE THEY ARE TREATING HER LIKE A MY PILLOW.\nYOU KNOW? BY THE WAY, MY PILLOWS, THE BEST\nPILLOW IN THE WORLD.

DONALD TRUMP WENT UNFACT-CHECKED\nBY MATT LAUER BUT SAYING THAT MAYBE HE WAS TOO EASY ON DONALD\nTRUMP STILL ISN'T SAYING THAT HE WAS TREATING HILLARY UNFAIRLY.\nTHOSE AREN'T MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. >> GOOD POINT.\n>> HE COULD HAVE BEEN TOO EASY ON TRUMP AND STILL TREATED HER\nFAIRLY. >> WHO PICKED HIM?\nTHAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW. >> BIG DIFFERENCE.\nDONALD TRUMP'S LIKE YEAH. HILLARY IS LIKE FURTHERMORE.\nYOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND, THESE LONG, LONG STORIES, YOU'RE ALL\nRIGHT SIX MINUTES IN, WE NEED ANOTHER QUESTION.\nYOU HAVE TO CUT HER OFF BECAUSE SHE WILL TRY TO ANSWER ONE\nQUESTION FOR 30 MINUTES. YOU WILL SAY THANK YOU, GOOD\nNIGHT, BE OUT. DONALD'S LIKE YEAH.\n>> KNOW WHY HE DOES YEAH? KNOW WHY HE DOES YEAH?\nBECAUSE THAT CAUSES THE HOST TO MOVE ON OR TO ANSWER HIS OWN\nQUESTION SO HE WILL ASK HIM ABOUT A CERTAIN THING THAT HE\nDOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT AND HE'LL GO HM, LIKE THE DIFFERENCE\nBETWEEN HAMAS AND HEZBOLLAH.

IF YOU BREAK DOWN THE\nTRANSLATION, HE'S A MAGICAL MAN. I HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM DO A MAGIC\nTRICK. KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?\nHE'S LIKE GET IN, I CAN'T WAIT, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME FUN.\n>> PUTIN MAKES PEOPLE DISAPPEAR. >> LIKE PAUL MANAFORT.\n>> EXACTLY. >> PUTIN TALKS TO US LIKE WE'RE\nA BUNCH OF BABIES. >> THAT'S TRUE.\nLIKE A BUNCH OF BABIES.

RESEARCHERS LOOKED AT THE TOP\n100 GROSSING FILMS OF 2015 AND FOUND THAT NEARLY 74% OF THE\nSPEAKING CHARACTERS WERE WHITE. 12.2% WERE BLACK.\n5.3% WERE LATINO. 3.9% WERE ASIAN.\nFOR MORE ON THIS STORY, WE CAUGHT UP WITH ONE OF\nHOLLYWOOD'S TOP DIRECTORS. HE ACTUALLY WON AN OSCAR FOR\n\"THE ENGLISH PATIENT.\" NICK, YOU ARE A HOLLYWOOD ACTOR\nWITH AN AMAZING POOL, I MIGHT ADD.\n>> HEATED. >> HEATED POOL.\nNOBODY HAS AN UNHEATED POOL. ALL RIGHT?\n>> I KNOW PEOPLE WHO DO. >> WE DO.\nIN MY FAMILY'S HOUSE WE HAVE AN ABOVE THE GROUND UNHEATED POOL.\nIT'S FUN FOR ABOUT FOUR MINUTES. >> MOST OF EVERYTHING IS FUN FOR\nFOUR MINUTES. DIVERSITY PROBLEM.\nIS THERE ONE? >> NO.\nI'VE GOT TWO WORDS FOR YOU. SUCK IT.\n>> ALL RIGHT. >> I DON'T EVEN WORK FOR THEM\nANYMORE, MAN. >> TNA.\nI DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE A CATCH PHRASE FOR THAT.\n>> YOU'RE A PERFORMER. >> THAT'S THE RUMOR. >> DO YOU FEEL YOU ARE LIMITED\nIN ROLES BECAUSE OF YOUR APPEARANCE?\n>> YEAH. >> YOU CAN'T PLAY PETER PAN.\n>> I HAVE TO BE THE CROCODILE. SIT IN THE WATER AND LOOK BIG,\nOPEN MY MOUTH. GOOD JOB.\nI STUDIED HAMLET. GOOD JOB, STAY THERE.\n>> DID YOU STUDY HAMLET? >> YEAH.\n>> REALLY? >> YEAH.\nTHEY WOULDN'T LET ME PLAY ANYTHING COOL IN THAT SO I QUIT.\n>> YOU CAN PLAY OTHELLO. >> I TRIED.\n>> THEY PICKED A WHITE GUY? >> THEY DID.\nI WENT TO SCHOOL IN NEBRASKA. IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT.\nPOINT IS, HOLLYWOOD IS RACIST. AND LIBERAL AT THE SAME TIME.\n>> ISN'T THAT WEIRD? >> YEP.\nGAY AND STRAIGHT. >> THAT'S TRUE.\n>> TOUGH AND SOFT. THEY DON'T LET TYRUS IN MARVEL\nMOVIES WHICH IS GARBAGE. IT'S REALLY THE BIGGEST CRIME.\nI'M EASILY THE BEST HULK EVER, OR SOMETHING.\nMARVEL WANTS TO BE ALL TYRUS. MY MARVEL LIFE MATTERS.\n>> I HAVE TO SAY, WHAT YOU SAID IS ACTUALLY BRILLIANT.\nTHE CONTRADICTIONS THAT YOU, LIKE THAT THEY ARE LIBERAL AND\nRACIST. THEY BELIEVE IN PROGRESSIVE\nCAUSES BUT IF IT DOESN'T MAKE MONEY, FORGET IT.\nTHEY ARE GAY AND STRAIGHT. THEY TALK ABOUT GAY RIGHTS BUT\nIF YOU'RE AN ACTOR AND YOU COME OUT GAY, THEY DON'T WANT THAT.\nTHEY WANT YOU IN THE CLOSET BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO BECOME\nRUPERT EVERETT. SEE.\nNOBODY REMEMBERS HIM. >> I REMEMBER HIM.\nI HAD A CRUSH ON HIM UNTIL HE CAME OUT.\n>> THERE YOU GO. >> VERY SIMPLE.\nTHAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. >> THERE WAS A BIG THING, TOO,\nABOUT MARK RUFFALO CASTING A PERSON WHO WAS NOT A\nTRANS-GENDER PERSON IN A TRANS-GENDER ROLE.\nIT'S LIKE THE BATTLES THAT THEY PICK ARE INCONSISTENT.\n>> LIKE THEY ARE ACTORS, THOUGH. THEY ACT.\n>> I THINK IT'S VERY INTERESTING, THE FOCUS ON\nDIVERSITY AT THE OSCARS DIDN'T SOLVE IT, I JUST THOUGHT THE\nHASH TAGS WOULD JUST CREATE A DIVERSE MOVIE.\nPEOPLE TOTALLY HAVE THE RIGHT IDEA ABOUT HOW TO SOLVE\nPROBLEMS. THEY WANT TO LOOK LIKE THEY CARE\nBUT THEY DON'T CARE. >> NO, THEY DON'T CARE.\nTHEY JUST WANT TO LOOK LIKE IT. WHAT DO YOU THINK?\n>> I THINK THERE'S MANY LAYERS TO THIS.\nI THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE HASH TAGS BECAUSE NOW WE'RE\nTALKING ABOUT IT AND THAT'S IMPORTANT.\nTHEY LISTENED TO THE PUBLIC. THEY LISTENED TO THE AUDIENCE.\n>> THEY STILL HAVE WHITEY MOVIES.\n>> BUT IT'S UNION SO THERE'S A FEW THINGS.\nUNIONS CONTROL HOLLYWOOD AND THEY ARE NOT PRIORITIZING THESE\nISSUES. I'M CALLING FOR THEM TO DO THAT.\nBUT IT'S ABOUT WHO ARE THE SCREEN WRITERS, WHO ARE THE\nSTUDIO EXECUTIVES WHO ARE CALLING FOR THESE MOVIES THAT\nARE ONLY ABOUT WHITE MEN AND WOMEN AND NOT ABOUT OFFERING\nDIFFERENT CHARACTERS, MORE LIKE THE REAL AMERICA.\n>> HOWEVER, THE PROBLEM IS IF THAT'S A SMALL PERCENTAGE, THE\nGUYS GOING LIKE WHAT IF WOMEN LIKE TO LOOK AT MALE ACTORS,\nTHERE ARE MORE WOMEN WHO GO WATCH NBA THAN WNBA, A STAT I\nMADE UP, BUT I ASSUME THAT I'M PROBABLY RIGHT.\nTHAT WOMEN ACTUALLY WOULD RATHER SEE JAMES BOND THAN, I DON'T\nKNOW, ANGELA LANSBURY. ANOTHER COMPARISON THAT FAILS\nME. HERE'S MY REQUEST.\nIF YOU CAN CHOOSE SELF-IDENTIFY GENDER OR RACE, CAN YOU\nSELF-IDENTIFY AS A SPECIFIC PERSON?\nCAN I DECIDE THAT I'M JULIA ROBERTS?\n>> YES. BUT WILL ANYBODY PAY TO SEE\nTHAT. >> I THINK THEY WOULD PAY TO SEE\nME AS JULIA ROBERTS. I HAVE A JULIA ROBERTS LAUGH.\n>> BUT DO YOU MAKE MONEY LIKE HER.\nSHE FUND-RAISES A LOT FOR PROGRESSIVE CAUSES.\n>> THEN THE OTHER THING, TOO, YOU BROUGHT UP THE UNIONS.\nIT'S ALMOST LIKE YOU THINK S.A.G. IS A REAL UNION OR\nSOMETHING WITH ANY POWER. >> THEY HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE.\n>> THAT'S FOR PEOPLE THAT OWN SCREEN ACTORS GUILD.\nYOU GUYS ARE GETTING INTO THE WEEDS WITH THIS S.A.G. STUFF.\n>> S.A.G.-AFTRA, ACTUALLY. >> THANK YOU.\nMR. WHITE PANTS. SHOULD HOMEWORK BE BANNED?\nWE DEBATE IT TO DEATH. OR AT LEAST UNTIL WE GET BORED.",

INCREDIBLY TIGHT RACE BOTH WHEN\nYOU LOOK AT THE NATIONAL POLLING BUT MORE IMPORTANT THE KEY SWING\nSTATES.

AMERICANS ACCORDING TO THE\nLATEST CNN POLL THINK THAT THE ECONOMY IS AT THE BEST PART IN\nYEARS. WHY IS SHE NOT DOING BETTER?\n>> THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. \"THE WASHINGTON POST\" HAD A\nSTORY ABOUT THAT YESTERDAY LOOKING AT PART OF THE REASON IS\nTHAT DEMOCRATS ARE FREAKING OUT ABOUT THIS BECAUSE DEMOCRATS\nTEND TO FREAK OUT ABOUT CAMPAIGNS.\nBUT THERE REALLY IS THIS QUESTION OF WHY HILLARY CLINTON\nHASN'T BEEN ABLE TO DISTANCE HERSELF MORE PARTICULARLY\nBECAUSE DONALD TRUMP HASN'T SHOWN AN ABILITY TO EXPAND HIS\nBASE.

MY CLIENT -- MY CLIENT --\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS FIVE TO SIX WAYS TO GET TO 270 AND DONALD\nTRUMP HAS ONLY ONE OR TWO WAYS TO GET TO 270 AND THAT'S WHERE\nTHE REAL FIGHT IS GOING TO BE FOR BOTH SIDES.\nTHAT'S ALL THAT REALLY MATTERS. >> THE ELECTORAL MAP IS MORE\nCHALLENGING FOR DONALD TRUMP RIGHT NOW.\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT PATHS TO 270, THERE IS THE BLUE WALL.\nTHE DEMOCRATS HAVE WON THE LAST SIX ELECTIONS.\nTHESE POLLS ARE ENCOURAGE TO GO YOUR CANDIDATE BUT IT'S NOT A\nBIG LEAD THAT HE HAS. >> TO BE PERFECTLY CANDID,\nPOPPY, THINGS ARE HAPPENING AT SUCH A RAPID CLIP OUT THERE THAT\nTHE POLLS TAKE A WHILE TO CATCH UP.\nJUST WITHIN THE LAST 24 HOURS, WE'VE HAD THIS WHOLE BASKET OF\nDEPLORABLES COMMENT FROM HILLARY CLINTON THAT I THINK IS GOING TO\nAFFECT POLLS EVENTUALLY, NOT TO MENTION WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING\nABOUT LISTENING TO THIS AFTERNOON WITH HER HEALTH\nSITUATION. SO I'LL TAKE THESE POLLS AS THEY\nARE. RIGHT NOW THEY SEEM PRETTY\nREASONABLE TO ME. I EXPECTED THAT WE WOULD BEGIN\nTO SEE THIS ONCE WE GOT PAST THE CONVENTION BOUNCES.\nTHAT'S WHERE WE ARE, AND BOY, BUCKLE IN.\n>> HEY, POPPY, ONE OTHER THING, IF I MAY.\nIF YOU LOOK AT THOSE STATES THAT YOU PUT UP, ONE OF THE\nSIGNIFICANT THINGS TO LOOK AT FOR YOUR VIEWERS IS THAT A LOT\nOF THOSE STATES ARE RED STATES THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS\nCOMPETING WITH BECAUSE SUBURBAN EDUCATED WHITE VOTERS ARE\nUNCOMFORTABLE WITH TRUMP AND HIS DEPLORABLES, IF YOU WILL.\n>> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GEORGIA, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ARIZONA.\nBUT SCOTT, I WANT YOUR TAKE ON THIS BECAUSE PRESIDENT OBAMA IN\nTHE LATEST POLLING HAS 58% APPROVAL RATING.\nTHAT'S HIGH. HIS NUMBER, HIS APPROVAL MATTERS\nA LOT FOR HILLARY CLINTON. NOT ONLY THAT, OUR LATEST CNN\nPOLL ON FRIDAY SHOWED THAT AMERICANS THINK THE ECONOMY IS\nTHE BEST IT'S BEEN IN NINE YEARS.\nTHOSE ARE TWO THINGS THAT ARGUABLY SHOULD BE HELPING\nCLINTON MORE THAN THEY SEEMINGLY ARE, SCOTT.\n>> WHEN HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP BEGIN GOING STRONG,\nI HOPE WE'LL SEE THAT IN EACH OF THEIR CAMPAIGNING.\nTHAT BEING SAID, EACH CANDIDATE STANDS ON THEIR OWN.\nWE KNOW WE HAVE BAKED-IN ISSUES, BUT HILLARY CLINTON NEEDS TO\nHAMMER AWAY AT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HER AND DONALD TRUMP AND\nTHE SUPPORT HE HAS OF BIGOTRY AND WHITE NATIONALISTS TO\nSEPARATE HIM FROM THAT OTHER GROUP WHO BELIEVE THEY'VE BEEN\nLEFT BEHIND IN THE ECONOMY, WHO ARE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THAT\nELEMENT OF TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN. THAT GROUP WHO FEELS LIKE\nTHEY'RE LEFT BEHIND ARE THE ONES YOU SEND THE MESSAGE TO ABOUT\nTHE ECONOMY AND TO GIVE HILLARY CLINTON A CHANCE.\nBECAUSE THEY'RE A GREAT TARGET AND THEY'RE UNCOMFORTABLE ENOUGH\nNOT TO VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE OF THAT ELEMENT.\n>> LARRY? I'M SORRY.\nI'M VERY SORRY, JEFFREY. I'M VERY SORRY, JEFFREY.\nJEFFREY. AWKWARD SILENCE.\n>> ONE OF THOSE DAYS. I THOUGHT HE LEFT.\n>> HE THOUGHT YOU WERE TALKING TO SOMEBODY ELSE.\n>> JEFFREY, GO AHEAD. YOUR RESPONSE TO WHAT SCOTT\nSAID. >> NUMBER ONE, DONALD TRUMP IS\nDOING VERY WELL IN THESE BATTLEGROUND DEMOCRATIC STATES.\nHE'S DOING WELL IN PENNSYLVANIA AND HE'S DOING WELL IN FLORIDA\nAND OHIO AND SOME OF THESE STATES THAT THE DEMOCRATS THINK\nTHEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO TAKE AND WALK OFF WITH.\nTHIS IS GOING TO BE A VERY HARD FIGHT DOWN THE ROAD HERE, AND I\nMUST SAY IN TERMS OF THAT COMMENT THERE, THAT BASKET OF\nDEPLORABLES, WHAT SHE'S SAYING IN ESSENCE IS THAT DONALD TRUMP\nSUPPORTERS ARE RACISTS OR BIGOTS, ET CETERA.\n>> NOT ALL OF THEM. >> SHE'S HAD TO RETRACT.\nTHE POINT IS, POPPY, THIS WAS GOING AROUND.\nTHIS WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT FUELED RONALD REAGAN'S SUCCESS\nAND FUELED, GOING BACK FURTHER, RICHARD NIXON'S SUCCESS IN 1971\nAND '72. IT'S SORT OF OVERLAID WITH A\nTHICK VENEER OF ELITISM. I DON'T DOUBT THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON BELIEVED WHAT SHE SAID WHEN SHE SAID THIS.\nTHAT IS A DOGMA SINCE THE VIETNAM WAR ERA.\nSO I THINK IT WAS A FREUDIAN SLIP.\nIT'S OUT THERE AND I THINK SHE'LL PAY A PRICE FOR IT.\n>> LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING. I'M GOING TO ASK THE CONTROL\nROOM TO PULL IT UP IF THEY HAVE IT.\nDAVID DUKE, THE GRAND DUKE OF THE KKK, TWEETED SOMETHING AND\nHE TWEETED SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE A MOVIE POSTER, AND IT SAYS\n\"THE DEPLORABLES\" ACROSS IT. AS A TRUMP SUPPORTER, THAT IS\nNOT GOOD FOR DONALD TRUMP TO HAVE ANY SUPPORT FROM GRAND\nWIZARD KKK -- HOW DOES HE -- HE FAILED TO DO IT IMMEDIATELY,\nTHOUGH, WHEN HE WAS ASKED BY JAKE TAPPER.\n>> HE'S ALREADY DONE IT REPEATEDLY.\n>> HOW DOES HE SEPARATE HIMSELF FROM THINGS LIKE THIS WHEN YOU\nHAVE DAVID DUKE TREATING THAT? >> VERY EASY, POPPY.\nWE'RE THE PARTY OF THE LINCOLN. THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS THE\nPARTY OF THE KU KLUX KLAN. THE KU KLUX KLAN WOULD NOT EXIST\nIF IT HADN'T BEEN TRAINED AS MANY UNIVERSITIES HAVE CITED.\nTHEY RAN THE 1934 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION.\n>> JEFFREY, I'M TALKING ABOUT TODAY AND I'M TALKING ABOUT\nCLEARLY GETTING SUPPORT FROM THE KKK GRAND WIZARD DAVID DUKE.\nHOW DOES HE SEPARATE HIMSELF FROM THAT?\n>> DAVID DUKE WAS A BIG SUPPORTER OF OCCUPY WALL STREET,\nSO WAS PRESIDENT OBAMA, SO WAS NANCY PELOSI, SO WAS HILLARY\nCLINTON. I HAVEN'T HEARD THEIR NEED TO\nAPOLOGIZE FOR SHARING THOSE VIEWS WITH HIM.\nI MEAN, HE'S THE HEAD OF THE CLAN.\nTHIS IS THE PARTY OF LINCOLN, THIS IS DONALD TRUMP.\n>> IF SO MUCH OF WHAT SHOCKING TO MANY PEOPLE OFFER TO THE\nCAMPAIGN CONSIDERED SO WRONG AND HOW COULD HE SAY THAT, HOW DO\nYOU THINK HE'S MANAGED TO GET THIS RACE SO INCREDIBLY TIGHT\nONCE AGAIN",

AS YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE THAT THE\nFUNDAMENTAL DIVIDING LINE IN OUR POLITICS IS CULTURE, NOT CLASS.\nAND THE DEMOCRATIC COALITION IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE GROUPS IN\nSOCIETY THAT ARE MOST COMFORTABLE WITH OUR INCREASING\nCULTURAL AND RACIAL DIVERSITY. THAT COALITION, MILLENNIALS,\nMINORITIES, COLLEGE EDUCATED, I THINK WANT TO HEAR HILLARY\nCLINTON DEFENDING THOSE VALUES AGAINST A REPUBLICAN NOMINEE\nTHAT THEY VIEW AS UNIQUELY HOSTILE TO THEM.\nIT WAS INEVITABLE THAT SHE WAS GOING TO QUALIFY THIS LANGUAGE.\nBUT I DO THINK THE FACT SHE'S STAYING ON THIS TERRAIN IS\nREVEALING.

ROUGHLY 60% BELIEVE HE IS\nBIASSED AGAINST WOMEN AND MINORITIES.\nONE OF THE OUTCOMES OF THAT IS THAT IN THIS SURVEY HILLARY\nCLINTON IS LEADING AMONG COLLEGE EDUCATED WHITE VOTERS BY SIX\nPOINTS. NO DEMOCRAT IN THE HISTORY OF\nPOLLING HAS EVER CARRIED MOST COLLEGE EDUCATED WHITES.\nTHOSE ARE VOTERS IN THE WAY OF WHERE DONALD TRUMP IS AND WHERE\nHE NEEDS TO BE. MOST OF THEM VIEW TRUMP AS\nUNQUALIFIED AND REQUEST WHETHER HE IS FAIR TO WOMEN AND\nMINORITIES. THAT IS THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE HE\nHAS TO RESOLVE TO MAKE THIS EVEN TIGHTER IN THE NEXT TWO MONTHS.\n>> THAT UNQUALIFIED NUMBER IS THE BARRIER FOR TRUMP.\nHE'S GOT TO GET THAT NUMBER WAY DOWN AS WE GET CLOSER TO\nELECTION DAY. >> AND THERE'S BEEN ALMOST NO\nCHANGE IN IT IN OVER A YEAR.

HE DIDN'T HAVE A BLACKBERRY BUT\nHE WRITES QUOTE, WHAT I DID DO IS HAVE A PERSONAL COMPUTER\nHOOKED UP TO A PRIVATE PHONE LINE SO I COULD COMMUNICATE WITH\nA WIDE RANGE OF FRIENDS, WISH I HAD THAT, DIRECTLY WITHOUT IT\nGOING THROUGH THE STATE DEPARTMENT SERVERS.\nHE ALSO WARNED HER QUOTE, IF IT IS PUBLIC THAT YOU HAVE A\nBLACKBERRY, AND IT IS GOVERNMENT AND YOU ARE USING IT TO DO\nBUSINESS, IT MAY BECOME AN OFFICIAL RECORD AND SUBJECT TO\nTHE LAW. BE VERY CAREFUL.\nI GOT AROUND IT ALL BY NOT SAYING MUCH AND NOT USING\nSYSTEMS THAT CAPTURED THE DATA. HM.\nPOWELL NOW SAYS HE WASN'T TRYING TO INFLUENCE CLINTON AND HE\nSTAND BY HIS DECISIONS REGARDING HOW HE HANDLED E-MAIL\nINFORMATION WHILE IN OFFICE. TRANSLATION, KEEP ME OUT OF\nTHIS. I'M RETIRED, ALL I WANT TO DO IS\nSIT AT HOME IN AN OPEN ROBE WATCHING \"FACTS OF LIFE\" RERUNS\nWHILE DRINKING WINE FROM A MUG. THAT'S WHAT I DO.\nTHAT'S WHAT I WOULD DO. I STILL DO.\nMEANWHILE, TREY GOWDY, REMEMBER HIM WITH THE HAIR, HE SAYS A\nWORKER FROM PLATTE RIVER NETWORKS WHO HANDLED THE SERVER\nDELETED HILLARY'S E-MAILS AFTER TALKING TO CLINTON AIDES.\nCLINTON CLAIMS THE WORKER DELETED ALL THE E-MAILS ON HIS\nOWN. HE WENT ROGUE. THROWING YET ANOTHER LOWLY PEON\nUNDER HER CAMPAIGN BUS. THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE UNDER\nTHERE. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT\nTOPIC? HUGE SCANDAL.\nBIGGER THAN WATERGATE. >> ACTUALLY, I JUST WATCHED \"ALL\nTHE PRESIDENT'S MEN\" FLYING BACK FROM JAPAN, WHERE I WRESTLED AND\nWON, AND THAT ACTUALLY WAS SOME GOOD STUFF.\nI MEAN, THERE WAS SOME STUFF GOING ON, MONIES CHANGING, GUYS\nLOSING JOBS, IT WAS COOL, IT WAS HOT.\nLIKE WOW, IT WAS REALLY INTERESTING.\nTHEN THERE'S THE E-MAILS. HERE'S THE THING.\nWHAT COLIN POWELL LAID OUT FOR HER WAS PRETTY -- LISTEN, YOU\nCAN DO THIS FOR PERSONAL STUFF, JUST DON'T DO IT VERY MUCH BUT\nIF YOU EVER CROSS IT OVER YOU COULD BE IN TROUBLE WITH THE\nLAW. YOU CAN'T GET ANY MORE DO NOT\nSEND WORK E-MAIL THROUGH YOUR PERSONAL SERVER OR YOU WILL GET\nIN TROUBLE. >> IT DOESN'T MATTER.\nIT DOESN'T MATTER.

SHE SHOULD BE THE PRESIDENT.\nTHAT'S RIDICULOUS. THE THINGS SHE USES AS DEFENSES\nARE EVEN WORSE THAN HER BEING A CRIMINAL BECAUSE IF SHE WAS A\nCRIMINAL AND WAS GOOD AT IT, THAT'S ONE THING.\nSHE'S SO BAD AT IT, I TELL PEOPLE WHAT TO DO AND THAT'S\nYOUR DEFENSE?

YOU DIE FROM YEARS AND YEARS OF\nHEART DISEASE. IT'S BORING BUT IT KILLS\nEVERYBODY. THAT'S THE SAME THING WITH THIS\nE-MAIL SCANDAL. WELL, MAYBE NOT.\nBUT IT'S CLOSE ENOUGH. IT'S SOMETHING THAT COULD BE\nDANGEROUS LATER.
