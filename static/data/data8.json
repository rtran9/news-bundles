              "text": "ALL OF THEM DID NOT REALIZE THAT\nTHE SECRETARY HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED ON FRIDAY.\nBUT INTERESTINGLY, WHEN YOU PIECE TOGETHER A TIMELINE OF\nTHIS, WE LIKELY WOULD NOT HAVE EVEN FOUND OUT ABOUT THE\nPNEUMONIA DIAGNOSIS HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THAT PIECE OF VIDEO\nTHAT A PASSERBY AT THE 9/11 CEREMONY TOOK AND POSTED ON\nSOCIAL MEDIA. THAT SET INTO A WHOLE COURSE\nCORRECTION OF THINGS GOING ON. BUT ONE ADVISER TOLD ME THAT\nTHEY BELIEVE THEY HAVE ERASED ALL THE TRANSPARENCY ADVANTAGES\nTHAT THEY MADE LAST WEEK WHEN SHE TALKED TO REPORTERS FOR FOUR\nDAYS IN A ROW, REALLY GOING ON THE OFFENSIVE WITH DONALD TRUMP.\nALL THAT MAY BE ERASED OVER THE WEEKEND BY THIS EPISODE.\nNOW, THIS IS LIKELY A BIGGER POLITICAL PROBLEM THAN IT IS A\nMEDICAL PROBLEM HERE, BUT STILL, WITH DONALD TRUMP BEING VERY\nUNPREDICTABLE IN THIS ARENA, THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN NOT EXACTLY\nSURE HOW TO PROCEED WITH HIS ACTS OF KINDNESS THIS MORNING.\nAS FOR HER, SHE'S GOING TO BE STAYING HERE TODAY AND TOMORROW,\nI'M TOLD, AND MIGHT MAKE A TRIP ON WEDNESDAY, AN ECONOMIC SPEECH\nSOME PLACE CLOSER TO NEW YORK, NOT FLYING TO NEVADA AS SHE HAD\nPLANNED TO. >> JEFF ZELENY IN CHAPPAQUA,\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH. 'WANT TO DISCUSS THIS WITH OUR\nPANEL. JOINED BY CNN CHIEF POLITICAL\nANALYST GLORIA BORGER, CNN PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN DOUGLAS\nBRINKLEY, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT DR. SANJAY GUPTA\nAND CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT AND ANCHOR OF\n\"INSIDE POLITICS\" JOHN KING. SANJAY, I WANT TO START WITH\nYOU. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT\nTHERE'S A MPOLITICAL AND MEDICA SIDE TO THIS.\nPURELY AND SIMPLY, HOW SERIOUS AND DEBILITATING IS PNEUMONIA\nAND HOW MUCH DO WE REALLY KNOW OR NOT KNOW ABOUT HILLARY\nCLINTON'S PNEUMONIA? >> WELL, IT'S INTERESTING\nBECAUSE WE JUST, OF COURSE, HEARD ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY EVEN\nTHOUGH IT WAS DIAGNOSED ON FRIDAY.\nBUT EVEN AT THAT POINT, WE STILL ARE WITH LIMITED INFORMATION.\nWE DON'T KNOW SPECIFICALLY WHAT KIND OF PNEUMONIA THIS IS.\nTHAT'S IMPORTANT. WE KNOW SHE'S ON ANTIBIOTICS SO\nTHIS MAY BE A BACTERIAL PNEUMONIA BUT WE DON'T KNOW FOR\nSURE. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT SPECIFIC\nPATHOGEN. THERE ARE WORSE PLAYERS IN TERMS\nOF WHAT CAN CAUSE PNEUMONIA VERSUS OTHERS.\nWE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH OF HER LUNG IS INVOLVED.\nDID SHE HAVE A CHEST EXX-RAY AN WHEN DID IT SHOW.\nWHAT ANTIBIOTIC WAS SHE PRESCRIBED.\nTHERE ARE A LOT OF UNKNOWNS. THEY MAY SOUND LIKE THEY ARE\nSORT OF INSIDE BASEBALL BUT TO ANSWER THE NEXT QUESTION, WHAT'S\nTHE RECOVERY TIME GOING TO BE, HOW MUCH WILL THIS IMPACT HER,\nYOU NEED THE ANSWER TO SOME OF THOSE FIRST QUESTIONS.\nALL WE KNOW IS SHE HAS PNEUMONIA, WAS DIAGNOSED ON\nFRIDAY. WE DON'T KNOW MUCH MORE.\n>> A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN POINTING TO THE COUGH THAT HAS\nBEEN PLAGUING HER ALL ALONG, ADVISERS AND HER AIDES HAVE SAID\nAND TOLD US THAT IT'S SEASONAL ALLERGIES SHE'S BEEN DEALING\nWITH. SHE HAS SAID THAT.\nARE THOSE TWO LINKED AT ALL? >> THEY COULD BE.\nIT SOUNDED LIKE MAYBE SHE HAS A COMPONENT OF SEASONAL ALLERGIES\nBUT THE PERSISTENT COUGH WAS WHAT SOUNDS LIKE, FROM READING\nTHE DOCTOR'S LETTER, PROMPTED THE VISIT TO THE DOCTOR ON\nFRIDAY. THEN SHE GOT THE DIAGNOSIS OF\nPNEUMONIA. AGAIN, EXACTLY HOW THAT\nDIAGNOSIS WAS MADE IS NOT CLEAR. I THINK IMPORTANT, BUT STILL NOT\nCLEAR. >> THE NOT CLEAR PART OF THIS IS\nWHAT I WANT TO PICK UP ON NEXT. GLORIA, DAVID AXELROD, OUR\nFRIEND, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST, TWEETED THIS OUT A FEW HOURS AGO\nAND THIS SET OFF A STORM, I THINK, ON TWITTER IN THE\nPOLITICAL WORLD. HE SAID ANTIBIOTICS CAN TAKE\nCARE OF PNEUMONIA. WHAT'S THE CURE FOR AN UNHEALTHY\nPENCHANT FOR PRIVACY THAT REPEATEDLY CREATES UNNECESSARY\nPROBLEMS? SO WHAT DAVID AXELROD IS GETTING\nAT THERE IS HILLARY CLINTON HIDES THINGS WHICH IS THE ISSUE\nHERE. >> YEAH.\nI AGREE WITH DAVID AND YOU KNOW, I HAVE BEEN SCRATCHING MY HEAD\nABOUT THIS BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE ALL THESE CONSPIRACY THEORIES\nOUT THERE ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH AND YOU HAVE\nDONALD TRUMP OUT THERE SAYING THAT SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE\nSTAMINA TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT, AND SHE'S BEEN COUGHING AND THEN\nYOU DISCOVER SHE HAS PNEUMONIA, WOULDN'T, A, THAT TAKE CARE OF A\nLOT OF THE PROBLEMS BY SAYING OKAY, WE CAN NOW EXPLAIN ALL OF\nTHIS BECAUSE SHE HAD PNEUMONIA AND SHE WAS WALKING AROUND WITH\nIT AND SHE DIDN'T KNOW IT, RIGHT, SO COULDN'T YOU JUST KIND\nOF SOLVE YOUR PROBLEM BY ACTUALLY TELLING WHAT OCCURRED?\nAND B, SHE HAS BEEN KNOWN AS SOMEONE, AS DAVID PUTS IT, WITH\nA PENCHANT FOR SECRECY. WE ALL KNOW THE E-MAIL ISSUES,\nFOR EXAMPLE. SO WOULDN'T THIS BE A WAY TO\nTURN THAT NARRATIVE AROUND AND SAY HEY, HERE I AM, I'M\nDISCLOSING THIS AND BY THE WAY, I'M CALLING FOR DONALD TRUMP TO\nDISCLOSE NOT ONLY ALL OF HIS HEALTH RECORDS, BUT HIS TAX\nRETURNS. SHE COULD HAVE TAKEN THIS AND\nTURNED THIS AROUND FOR HERSELF IN SO MANY WAYS.\nSO THAT'S KIND OF, YOU KNOW, MIND-BOGGLING TO ME.\n>> JOHN, YOU HAVE COVERED THE CLINTONS SINCE ARKANSAS.\nAS GLORIA POINTS OUT, THESE ARE PEOPLE, HILLARY CLINTON HAS A\nPENCHANT FOR SECRECY. IT SEEMS THAT ON SOME LEVEL, THE\nCAMPAIGN KNOWS THAT THEY MESSED UP.\nJENNIFER PALMIERI SENDING OUT IN RESPONSE TO DAVID AXELROD'S\nTWEET, SENDING OUT A TWEET SAYING WE COULD HAVE DONE BETTER\nYESTERDAY, GOING ON TO THEN HIT DONALD TRUMP TO SAY BUT THE FACT\nTHE PUBLIC KNOWS MORE ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON THAN ANY NOMINEE\nIN HISTORY. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF HOW THEY\nHAVE HANDLED THIS, THIS TIMELINE SINCE FRIDAY TO TODAY?\n>> IT MAKES NO SENSE TO A LOT OF PEOPLE.\nWHEN I GET ASKED THESE QUESTIONS BECAUSE OF MY EXPERIENCE WITH\nTHE CLINTONS I JUST SAY C-L-I-N-T-O-N.\nTHIS IS WHAT THEY DO. THIS IS WHAT THEY HAVE ALWAYS\nDONE. WE WOULD NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS,\nI'M CERTAIN WE WOULD NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS HAD THAT PASSERBY NOT\nSHOT THAT VIDEO. WE STILL WOULD NOT KNOW SHE HAD\nBEEN DIAGNOSED IF THE VIDEO DIDN'T GO VIRAL AND THEY\nREALIZED THEY HAD SOMETHING SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL.\nTO GLORIA'S AND DAVID'S POINT, LOOK, TRYING TO GET THE CLINTONS\nTO ACCEPT THIS TRANSPARENCY ARGUMENT, TALK TO DAVID GERGEN,\nTO POLITICAL ADVISERS WHO HAVE BEEN IN THE WHITE HOUSE WITH\nTHEM, IS LIKE TRYING TO PARALLEL PARK AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER.\nTHEY SIMPLY DO NOT LISTEN. THEY SIMPLY DO NOT LISTEN.\nTHEY SAY IN A MOMENT OF CRISIS, THEN THEY GIVE AS MUCH AS THEY\nTHINK THEY NEED TO GIVE. PERHAPS THIS WILL CHANGE THIS.\nPERHAPS THIS WILL CHANGE THIS. AS JEFF NOTED AT THE TOP, THEY\nARE TRYING TO MAKE A CASE OF DONALD TRUMP'S LACK OF\nTRANSPARENCY WHICH IS CONSIDERABLE, WHICH IS\nCONSIDERABLE. THEY WANT TO KNOW ABOUT HIS\nBUSINESS INTERESTS, THEY WANT TO KNOW ABOUT HIS TAXES.\nIF SHE HAD ANY HIGH GROUND AND I CAPITAL I, CAPITAL F, IF SHE HAD\nANY HIGH GROUND IN THAT DEBATE IT IS LOST AGAIN WITH THIS ONE.\nCAN SHE NOW TRY TO SPIN IT, WILL THEY ALLOW DR. GUPTA TO MEET\nWITH HER DOCTORS OR OTHER MEDICAL CORRESPONDENTS, PEOPLE\nWHO SPEAK THE LANGUAGE, FORGET GUYS LIKE ME AND MR. BERMAN AND\nKATE, NO OFFENSE. WE SHOULDN'T BE IN THAT ROOM.\nLET THE DOCTORS GO IN AND THE MEDICAL CORRESPONDENTS GO IN,\nTHE ONES WHO SPEAK THE LANGUAGE. SANJAY CAN TELL YOU JOHN McCAIN\nDID, SHOW THEM THE RECORDS. IF SOME STUFF HAS TO BE KEPT\nPRIVATE FOR SENSITIVITY REASONS, FINE.\nDOCTORS UNDERSTAND THAT STUFF. LET THEM COME OUT AND REPORT TO\nNA AMERICAN PEOPLE WE LOOKED AT THE\nBOOKS AND HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW. >> I WANT TO SIDE-TRACK TO THE\nDONALD TRUMP ISSUE TO GET HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE FROM YOU,\nDOUG. DEMOCRATS AND HILLARY CLINTON\nSUPPORTERS NOTE THAT DONALD TRUMP, WHEN IT COMES TO\nTRANSPARENCY, IS ACTUALLY HISTORICALLY NON-TRANSPARENT.\nWE HAVEN'T SEEN HIS TAX RETURNS. THAT'S SOMETHING EVERY CANDIDATE\nHAS DONE GOING WAY BACK. HIS LETTER FROM HIS DOCTOR IS\nALMOST COMICAL IN ITS SIMPLICITY COMPARED TO WHAT HILLARY CLINTON\nRELEASED WHICH WASN'T GREAT IN AND OF ITSELF.\nTHESE BLACKLISTED REPORTERS FROM THE CAMPAIGN, HE'S GOT NO\nCAMPAIGN PRESS POOL TRAVELING WITH HIM, EVER.\nDRAMATIC READING OF THE DOCTOR'S LETTER.\n>> THE BEST LINE OF ALL. IF ELECTED, DONALD TRUMP I CAN\nSTATE UNEQUIVOCALLY WILL BE THE HEALTHIEST INDIVIDUAL EVER\nELECTED TO THE PRESIDENCY. >> DONALD TRUMP NO BASTION OF\nTRANSPARENCY HIMSELF. >> OF COURSE NOT.\nI THINK HE WILL STEP UP AND TRY TO DO A HALFWAY MEASURE HERE.\nI THINK HE WILL RELEASE HIS LAST WEEK'S PHYSICAL THAT HE TOOK AND\nSAY MY CHOLESTEROL NUMBER'S RIGHT, MY BLOOD COUNT'S RIGHT\nAND TRY TO DO A KIND OF QUASI-MEDICAL REPORT TO PACIFY\nPEOPLE. IF HE DOES THAT BEFORE HILLARY\nCLINTON DOES ANYTHING, IT WILL GIVE HIM A KIND OF UPPER HAND.\nI WOULD URGE HILLARY CLINTON AND HER CAMPAIGN TO JUST BE AS\nTRANSPARENT. WE SHOULD HAVE ANSWERS TO THESE\nQUESTIONS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WITH THESE FEW DAYS LEFT, SHE'S\nBASICALLY BEING DIMINISHED THIS WEEK.\nSO MUCH SO THAT I THINK TIM KAINE NOW HAS TO REALLY STEP UP\nFOR HER AND LET PEOPLE SEE WHAT WOULD A TIM KAINE AS COMMANDER\nIN CHIEF BE LIKE. THIS IS A GREAT SETBACK AND THE\nONLY WAY OUT OF IT FOR HER IS TOTAL HONESTY, TOTAL\nTRANSPARENCY. WE LIKE COMEBACKS IN AMERICA.\nSHE COULD TAKE A FEW DAYS OFF AND MAYBE SHOW UP WEDNESDAY IN\nLAS VEGAS AND GIVE A GREAT ECONOMIC SPEECH AND SEEM TO HAVE\nVIM AND VIGOR AND TURN THIS AROUND.\nBUT IF THEY KEEP TRYING TO HIDE AND OBFUSCATE HER REAL\nCONDITION, IT'S GOING TO BE A BIG ALBATROSS ALL THE WAY UNTIL\nELECTION DAY. >> SANJAY, WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT\nEVERY COLD THAT EVERY CANDIDATE HAS.\nDO WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT SEASONAL ALLERGIES EVERY\nCANDIDATE HAS? DO WE NEED TO KNOW, THE AMERICAN\nPUBLIC, AMERICAN VOTER, MAYBE THEY DON'T -- DO THEY NEED TO\nKNOW SHE HAS PNEUMONIA? WHERE'S THE LINE FOR YOU?\n>> THE LINE IS ANYTHING THAT CAN IMPAIR HER FUNCTION, HER\nJUDGMENT OVERALL, IMPAIR HER ABILITY TO DO HER JOB.\nYOU ARE HIRING SOMEONE FOR A JOB.\nIN THIS CASE, THE JOB IS PRESIDENT.\nI DON'T THINK WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT EVERYTHING AND PEOPLE ARE\nENTITLED TO A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PRIVACY, NO QUESTION.\nBUT THINGS THAT AFFECT BIG THINGS, THE HEART, THE LUNGS,\nTHE BRAIN. REMEMBER IN 2012 EVEN, THE\nINFORMATION ABOUT HER CONCUSSION, HER BRAIN INJURY,\nTHAT CAME OUT SLOWLY AS WELL. FIRST IT WAS THE VIRAL ILLNESS,\nALL THESE OTHER THINGS. SLOWLY, MAYBE AS JOHN KING WAS\nSORT OF DESCRIBING, IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE PRESSURE OR\nWHATNOT, IT WAS RELEASED. THAT WAS IMPORTANT.\nTHAT WAS A BRAIN INJURY. SHE ALSO HAD DOUBLE VISION FOR A\nPERIOD OF TIME REQUIRING PRISM GLASSES.\nSHE'S RECOVERED FROM THAT ACCORDING TO HER DOCTOR'S\nREPORT. SHE'S BEEN TESTED, SHE'S\nRECOVERED FROM THAT, BUT IT TOOK A LONG TIME FOR US TO GET THAT\nINFORMATION. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT\nIF SHE WERE PRESIDENT. >> QUICKLY, ONE MORE MEDICAL\nQUESTION. DONALD TRUMP SAYS HE GOT A\nCHECKUP AND IS GETTING THE NUMBERS WORKED OUT RIGHT NOW.\nHE'S GOING ON DR. OZ'S SHOW THURSDAY AND RELEASING SOME OF\nTHEM. HOW MUCH DO WE KNOW ABOUT WHAT\nWE ARE REALLY GOING TO LEARN? WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO LEARN?\n>> GREAT QUESTION. WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO GET IS\nPROBABLY A SNAPSHOT IN TIME. FROM WHAT I HAVE HEARD, THEY\nWILL RELEASE LAB RESULTS, PRIMARILY.\nI'M NOT EVEN SURE WE WILL GET ALL THE FINDINGS OF THE PHYSICAL\nEXAM. BUT A TRUE DETAILED THING WOULD\nNOT ONLY BE A SNAPSHOT IN TIME WHICH WAS SOME IMPORTANCE, BUT\nALSO, LOOKING BACK OVER TIME. REALLY FIGURING OUT WHAT SORT OF\nDISEASES THE PERSON'S AT RISK FOR, ARE THERE ANY PARTICULAR\nCONCERNS THAT ARE GOING TO COME UP IF THE PERSON IS ELECTED\nREALLY OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. >> YOU KNOW, GLORIA, JUMP IN ON\nTHIS, BUT ALSO ON THE FACT JEFF ZELENY BROUGHT UP AT THE TOP OF\nTHE SHOW THAT SHE'S NOT EVEN GOING -- LIKELY NOT EVEN --\nSHE'S OFF THE TRAIL FOR A COUPLE DAYS BUT ALSO NOT EVEN LIKELY\nGOING TO MAKE IT TO NEVADA FOR CAMPAIGN EVENTS.\nWHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR A CANDIDATE?\n>> LOOK, IT'S DIFFICULT. SHE'S PHONING IN TO\nFUND-RAISERS. IT'S HARD.\nIT MEANS SHE'S SICK. LET ME ALSO SAY, PEOPLE GET SICK\nON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL ALL THE TIME.\nRIGHT? WE ALL HAVE BEEN OUT ON\nCAMPAIGNS AND HAVE ALL GOTTEN SICK ON CAMPAIGNS.\nWHICH IS AGAIN, WHY IT'S SO CONFOUNDING THAT THEY DIDN'T\nJUST SAY SHE'S SICK. SHE GOT PNEUMONIA.\nOTHER PEOPLE ON HER PLANE ARE SICK AND SHE CAUGHT A BUG AND\nTHAT WOULD SETTLE SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT SHE HAS RIGHT NOW.\nYOU KNOW, NOT DOING IT ONLY PLAYS INTO A BAD PRE-EXISTING\nNARRATIVE FOR HER WHICH IS A TERRIBLE THING TO DO DURING A\nCAMPAIGN, WHICH IS THAT THE CLINTONS AS JOHN WAS SAYING\nEARLIER SORT OF PRIZE SECRECY ABOVE ALL ELSE.\nBY THE WAY, I DON'T THINK DONALD TRUMP SHOULD GET AWAY WITH JUST\nHIS PHYSICAL REPORT HERE. IT'S SORT OF LIKE SAYING I GAVE\nYOU MY FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE FORM AND THAT'S LIKE GIVING YOU MY\nTAX RETURNS. THE TWO ARE NOT THE SAME.\n>> NOT AT ALL. >> MEDICAL RECORDS ARE MEDICAL\nRECORDS. >> JOHN KING, TWO DAYS AFTER THE\nTRAIL IN SEPTEMBER. THAT'S HUGE AMOUNT OF REAL\nESTATE TO CEDE. THAT'S JUST THIS WEEK.\nWE DON'T KNOW WHEN SHE GETS BACK TO THE TRAIL HOW VIGOROUSLY SHE\nWILL BE ABLE TO CAMPAIGN. THIS TYPE OF THING YOU WOULD\nTHINK WOULD MATTER GOING FORWARD.\n>> WELL, BETTER NOW THAN A MONTH FROM NOW.\nTHINK ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE WATCHING US AND EVEN PEOPLE IN\nPART OF THIS CONVERSATION. I BET HALF OF US HAVE A COLD.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE AT HOME, SOME OF THEM PROBABLY HOME FROM WORK\nBECAUSE THEY COULDN'T GO TO WORK.\nTO GLORIA'S POINT, CANDIDATES ARE HUMAN, TOO.\nIF SHE WOULD JUST BE HUMAN AND TRANSPARENT AND EXPLAIN THIS, A\nLOT OF PEOPLE WOULD SAY I JUST WENT THROUGH THAT, OH, MY KIDS\nARE GOING THROUGH THAT, MY PARTNER, MY SPOUSE, MY BROTHER,\nMY SISTER. SOME OF THIS IS STAFF BUT IN\nTHIS CASE, IT'S THE CLINTONS, THEY JUST REFUSE TO BE HUMAN, IF\nYOU WILL, AND TALK TO PEOPLE. BUT TO YOUR POINT, THERE'S A\nDEBATE TWO WEEKS FROM TONIGHT. IT'S KIND OF AN IMPORTANT\nDEBATE. THIS RACE RIGHT NOW IS VERY\nTIGHT IN THE NATIONAL POLLS. PENNSYLVANIA, FLORIDA, OHIO,\nNORTH CAROLINA, NEW HAMPSHIRE, GEORGIA, ARIZONA, ALL STATES\nWITHIN TWO OR THREE POINTS. IT IS A WIDE OPEN RACE.\nYOU WOULD HAVE TO SAY SLIGHT ADVANTAGE CLINTON WHEN YOU LOOK\nAT THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE MAP BUT SLIGHT ADVANTAGE CLINTON.\nIN A DEBATE TWO WEEKS FROM TONIGHT, DO YOU WANT THAT DEBATE\nTO BE ABOUT TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR HEALTH RECORDS, TELL ME\nMORE ABOUT YOUR TAXES FOR BOTH CANDIDATES?\nTHAT'S WHY SHE STARTED TO COME OUT LAST WEEK AND TALK TO\nREPORTERS. SHE DIDN'T WANT THE DEBATE TO BE\nABOUT YOU HAVEN'T HAD A PRESS CONFERENCE IN NEARLY A YEAR.\nSO YOU TRY TO CLEAN UP YOUR PROBLEMS HEADING INTO THE FIRST\nDEBATE SO THAT IT CAN BE ABOUT THINGS OTHER THAN YOUR PROBLEMS.\nWELL, SHE HAS A PROBLEM. SHE HAS TWO WEEKS.\n>> FINAL THOUGHT? >> MY FINAL THOUGHT IS REMEMBER\nTHAT DONALD TRUMP WENT AFTER JEB BUSH ABOUT BEING LOW ENERGY AND\nIT JUST DEVASTATED JEB BUSH. I THINK HILLARY CLINTON KEPT\nHEARING THAT SHE DIDN'T HAVE STAMINA AND MY GOSH, SHE WAS\nGOING TO PROVE DONALD TRUMP WRONG.\nBUT SHE OVERCROWDED HER SCHEDULE, GOT FATIGUED,\nEXHAUSTED AND NOW PNEUMONIA. IN A WAY SHE LET DONALD TRUMP\nGET INTO HER HEAD. SHE'S GOT THE TAKE A FEW DAYS\nOFF AND FIND WAYS TO REGAIN THE MOMENTUM.\nTHE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS TO PREPARE FOR THAT BIG DEBATE AND\nSEEM TO BEAT HIM AT THAT. SHE COULD OVERNIGHT RECLAIM THE\nMOMENTUM SHE'S BEEN LOSING. >> SEEMS OVERNIGHT THIS RACE CAN\nSWING ONE WAY AND ANOTHER AS WE HAVE SEEN.\nGREAT TO SEE YOU.",

WHILE DONALD TRUMP IS REVEALING\nHE DID HAVE A PHYSICAL LAST WEEK AND IS PLANNING TO RELEASE THE\nRESULTS WHEN QUOTE, THE NUMBERS COME IN.\nLET'S TALK ABOUT THAT SOME MORE. CNN CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST\nGLORIA BORGER IS HERE, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT JOHN KING\nJOINS ME AND SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT BRIANNA KEILAR IS\nALSO WITH ME. WELCOME TO ALL OF YOU.\nSO JOHN, DONALD TRUMP SAYS HE HAD A PHYSICAL, HE'S GOING TO\nRELEASE THE NUMBERS. WILL THAT SETTLE QUESTIONS ABOUT\nHIS HEALTH? >> I DON'T THINK SO.\nIN THE CONVERSATION YOU JUST HAD SHOULD BE INSTRUCTIVE FOR\nANYBODY WATCHING AT HOME. THE GOOD DOCTOR JUST LAID OUT\nTHE CASE HERE THAT AS HE SAID, A PHYSICAL GREAT, LET'S HAVE MORE\nRECORDS, MR. TRUMP RELEASED ONLY A FOUR PARAGRAPH LETTER FROM HIS\nDOCTOR THAT REALLY HAS NOTHING EXCEPT ADJECTIVES SAYING HE'S\nAMAZING AND AWESOME, WILL BE THE MOST FIT PRESIDENT IN HISTORY.\nIT SAYS NOTHING. AS JEFF SAID, TAKE A STEP BACK.\nEITHER CANDIDATE WILL BE OLDER THAN RONALD REAGAN ON THE DAY\nTHEY TOOK OFFICE. REAGAN WAS THE OLDEST ELECTED\nPRESIDENT IN UNITED STATES HISTORY.\nTHERE IS A PUBLIC RIGHT TO KNOW. IT'S GOOD THAT DONALD TRUMP SAYS\nHE'S GOING TO RELEASE THINGS. HE ALSO SAID BACK IN 2011 IF THE\nPRESIDENT RELEASED HIS BIRTH CERTIFICATE HE WOULD RELEASE HIS\nTAXES. HE PLAYS THIS GAME, IT'S GREAT\nTHAT HE'S NOW ON THE RECORD SAYING HE WILL RELEASE SOME OF\nTHIS, BUT WHY DON'T BOTH CAMPAIGNS INVITE DR. GUPTA IN TO\nSEE THEIR DOCTOR, INVITE OTHER MEDICAL EXPERTS IN TO SEE THEIR\nDOCTOR? DO YOU THIS PUBLICLY, YOU KNOW\nWHAT HAPPENS. THE STUNT DUMMIES SHOW UP AND\nASK CRAZY QUESTIONS. >> WOULD HE BE WILLING TO DO\nTHAT? >> ABSOLUTELY.\nHE DID IT BEFORE IN 2008. >> WE WENT THROUGH THIS IN 2008\nBECAUSE OF JOHN McCAIN, BECAUSE OF HIS AGE AND BECAUSE OF HIS\nTREATMENT IN VIETNAM. THERE WERE QUESTIONS.\nJOHN McCAIN DID THE RIGHT THING. HE SAID HERE THEY ARE.\nASK THE QUESTION. THIS IS NOT HARD.\nYOU DON'T HAVE TO DO A FULL-BLOWN PUBLIC NEWS\nCONFERENCE WHERE THE STUNT DUMMIES SHOW UP AND ASK STUPID\nQUESTIONS. YOU CAN GET THE MEDICAL\nCORRESPONDENTS WHO SPEAK THE LANGUAGE, HAVE THE DOCTOR THERE,\nSHOW THEM THE RECORDS. SOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS MIGHT\nHAVE TO BE OFF THE RECORD TO RESPECT THE CANDIDATES' PRIVACY.\nSO WHAT? >> HERE'S THE OTHER THING.\nHERE'S THE OTHER THING. THESE CANDIDATES ARE 68 YEARS\nOLD AND 70 YEARS OLD. THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE PROBLEMS\nBECAUSE WHEN YOU ARRIVE AT THAT AGE, YOU GOT PROBLEMS.\nIT'S JUST NATURAL. WHY NOT JUST RELEASE THIS STUFF?\n>> I AGREE. HERE'S WHERE I THINK WE FELL\nDOWN ON THE JOB, ACTUALLY. WE IN THE MEDIA.\nBARACK OBAMA, WHO WAS OBVIOUSLY VIGOROUS AND HEALTHY AND A\nJOGGER, HE DIDN'T RELEASE COMPLETE MEDICAL RECORDS.\nTHAT WAS FINE. MITT ROMNEY, BY THE WAY, DID NOT\nEITHER, OKAY? SO THERE HAS BEEN A PERIOD OF\nTIME WHERE IT KIND OF -- IT KIND OF FELL BY THE WAYSIDE.\nNOW AS YOU ARE ALL POINTING OUT, WE HAVE CANDIDATES WHO ARE OLDER\nAND IN HILLARY CLINTON'S CASE, SERIOUS PRE-EXISTING HEALTH\nISSUES. WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP'S HEALTH. I THINK THAT DISCLOSURE IS\nREALLY WARRANTED HERE. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT DISCLOSURE\nIS WARRANTED IN THE SAME WAY ON YOUR TAX RETURNS AND I THINK\nTHAT THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT THE PUBLIC NEEDS TO KNOW THE\nANSWERS TO. WE LET IT GO BY THE BOARDS FOR A\nLITTLE BIT AND THAT WAS WRONG AS WELL.\n>> THE THING IS, BRIANNA, I THINK, I DON'T KNOW, PERHAPS\nHILLARY CLINTON WOULD FEEL MORE PRESSURE IN RELEASING HER\nMEDICAL RECORDS BECAUSE SHE'S SICK NOW WITH PNEUMONIA, RIGHT?\nDONALD TRUMP CAN SAY YEAH, HAD A PHYSICAL, HOPE THE NUMBERS WILL\nBE GOOD, BUT DOES HE REALLY HAVE THAT NEED AS MUCH AS HILLARY\nCLINTON DOES TO RELEASE HIS MEDICAL RECORDS?\n>> I THINK THEY DEFINITELY BOTH HAVE THEIR NEED BUT BECAUSE\nHILLARY CLINTON IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS BASICALLY WHAT'S BECOME\nTHIS CAMPAIGN CRISIS FOR HER OVER HER HEALTH, BECAUSE SHE WAS\nNOT FORTHCOMING WHEN SHE FOUND OUT ON FRIDAY THAT SHE HAD\nPNEUMONIA, AND ALSO, I THINK THERE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE\nSOMETHING THAT SHE DOES OR THE CAMPAIGN DOES TO TRY TO BE MORE\nTRANSPARENT AND TO TRY TO REPAIR SOME OF THAT TRUST.\nSHE SPENT ALL LAST WEEK HAVING REPORTERS ON HER PLANE, TALKING\nTO THEM EVERY DAY, TRYING TO PUT OUT THIS SENSE OF BEING MORE\nCONNECTED, MORE ACCESSIBLE, AND THEN THIS HAPPENS.\nFRIDAY SHE'S DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA AND IT DOESN'T COME\nOUT UNTIL SUNDAY WHEN BASICALLY THEY HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO\nEXPLAIN WHAT HAD HAPPENED BECAUSE OF THIS VIDEO.\nYOU HEAR THE CAMPAIGN SAYING, YOU HEAR JEN PALMIERI SAYING WE\nCOULD HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB. WHAT'S ALSO CLEAR IS THAT THERE\nARE MANY PEOPLE IN THE CAMPAIGN WHO DID NOT KNOW THAT SHE WAS\nILL. THEY CAN ONLY DO THEIR JOB WITH\nTHE FACTS. SO IT'S UNCLEAR EVEN WITH SOME\nOF THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE MOST EQUIPPED TO HANDLE A SITUATION\nLIKE THIS IF THEY EVEN KNEW THE SPECIFICS OF WHERE HILLARY\nCLINTON WAS WITH HER HEALTH. THAT'S SORT OF THE BIGGER ISSUE\nHERE FOR HER AND HER CAMPAIGN. >> HERE'S WHAT LEAVES ME\nSCRATCHING MY HEAD, THOUGH. IF YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A PROBLEM\nAND THERE ARE ALL THESE KINDS OF CONSPIRACY THEORIES OUT THERE,\nABOUT YOUR HEALTH, AND YOU DISCOVER THAT FINALLY, SHE HAS\nPNEUMONIA WHICH IS -- EXPLAINS EVERYTHING, RIGHT, THE COUGHING\nAND EVERYTHING ELSE, THEN WHY WOULDN'T YOU DISCLOSE THAT AS A\nWAY TO SHUT DOWN ALL OF THAT SPECULATION THAT YOU REALLY\nDON'T WANT, EITHER FROM YOUR COMPETITOR OR FROM OUT THERE IN\nTHE ETHER? >> COULDN'T YOU LOOK AT IT THE\nOTHER WAY, TOO, THAT IF YOUR OPPONENT CALLS YOU LACKING IN\nSTAMINA AND YOU CAN'T TAKE THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND YOU CAN'T\nTAKE THE PRESIDENCY, DOESN'T IT WORK THE OTHER WAY, TOO, THAT\nYOU WOULDN'T WANT TO TELL PEOPLE THAT YOU GOT TIRED ON THE\nCAMPAIGN TRAIL AND CAME DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA?\n>> I THINK PEOPLE CATCH PNEUMONIA ALL THE TIME ON THE\nCAMPAIGN TRAIL. >> THERE ARE MANY REPORTERS, I\nWILL TELL YOU, JUST PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN KEEPING PACE ON THE\nCAMPAIGN TRAIL WHO HAVE BEEN CATCHING PNEUMONIA.\nIT HAS BEEN HAPPENING. I THINK THAT -- I THINK THAT SHE\nWAS DEALT A SET OF CARDS WHICH WAS SHE HAD PNEUMONIA SO HOW DO\nYOU DEAL WITH THAT, AND HAD SHE LEANED IN TOWARDS BEING MORE\nTRANSPARENT, I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE WORKED\nOUT OBVIOUSLY MUCH BETTER FOR HER THAN WHAT WE ARE SEEING NOW.\nCOULD THEY HAVE FORESEEN WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY, NO, BUT BY\nTRYING TO MANAGE IT THEMSELVES AND BEING FORTHCOMING ABOUT IT\nON FRIDAY, AT LEAST THEY MAINTAIN SOME CONTROL OF THE\nSITUATION WHICH THEY COMPLETELY LOST YESTERDAY.\n>> CAROL, CAN I GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES?\nON THE ISSUE OF TAXES, THAT NOTED CHAMPION OF OPEN AND\nTRANSPARENT GOVERNMENT, RICHARD NIXON, IS THE ONE WHO SET THE\nSTANDARD. RICHARD NIXON SET THE STANDARD.\nDO YOU WANT TO BE JUDGED AND HILLARY CLINTON IN THAT REGARD\nHAS PUT HER TAXES OUT THERE. DONALD TRUMP SHOULD BE HELD\nACCOUNTABLE TO THAT STANDARD. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY,\nWE LIVE IN THE INTERNET AGE, THE TRANSPARENT AGE.\nIF YOU HAVE TO CALL IN TAX EXPERTS, FINANCIAL REPORTERS TO\nTALK TO HIS PEOPLE IF HE'S REALLY BEING AUDITED AND THEY\nHAVE TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THAT, BRING PEOPLE IN AND EXPLAIN IT\nTO THEM IN A PRIVATE SECURE SETTING AND HAVE THE MAJOR NEWS\nORGANIZATIONS SAY WE COULDN'T LEARN ABOUT SOME OF THIS BECAUSE\nTHEY PROVED TO US IT'S SENSITIVE, WHATEVER.\nCALL THEM IN. RICHARD NIXON ON TAXES.\nPRETTY GOOD PRECEDENT'S BEEN SET FOR A LONG TIME.\nTHIS IS A COPY OF THE LETTER RONALD REAGAN RELEASED TO THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE IN NOVEMBER 1994.\nHE WAS A FORMER PRESIDENT AT THE TIME.\nWHEN HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ALZHEIMER'S, HE SAID UPON\nLEARNING THE NEWS, NANCY AND I HAD TO DECIDE WHETHER AS PRIVATE\nCITIZENS WE WOULD KEEP THIS AS A PRIVATE MATTER OR WHETHER WE\nWOULD MAKE THIS NEWS KNOWN IN A PUBLIC WAY.\nIN THE PAST, NANCY SUFFERED FROM BREAST CANCER AND I HAD CANCER\nSURGERIES. WE FOUND THROUGH OUR OPEN\nDISCLOSURES WE WERE ABLE TO RAISE PUBLIC AWARENESS.\nWE WERE HAPPY THAT AS A RESULT, MANY MORE PEOPLE UNDERWENT\nTESTING. THAT'S CALLED LEADING BY\nEXAMPLE. WHY CAN'T WE HAVE IT?\nBE TRANSPARENT. >> WE'LL SEE IF THE CANDIDATES\nBECOME MORE TRANSPARENT. AS THEY SAY, ONLY TIME WILL\nTELL. I HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE.\nGLORIA, JOHN, BRIANNA, THANKS TO",

THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME.\nHEALTH PROBLEMS FORCE HILLARY CLINTON TO CANCEL CAMPAIGN\nEVENTS AND DONALD TRUMP UPS THE ANTE BY PROMISING TO REVEAL\nLONG-AWAITED DETAILS ON HIS OWN HEALTH.\n>> THIS WEEK, I TOOK, THIS LAST WEEK I TOOK A PHYSICAL AND I'LL\nBE RELEASING WHEN THE NUMBERS COME IN, HOPEFULLY THEY ARE\nGOING TO BE GOOD. I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE\nGOOD. I FEEL GREAT.\nBUT WHEN THE NUMBERS COME IN, I'LL BE RELEASING VERY, VERY\nSPECIFIC NUMBERS. >> TRUMP UNDERSCORING NEW\nQUESTIONS ABOUT CLINTON'S HEALTH AFTER SHE ABRUPTLY LEFT A 9/11\nMEMORIAL SERVICE, APPEARED WOBBLY AS SHE WAS LED INTO A\nVAN. LAST NIGHT, HER DOCTOR REVEALED\nSHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA TWO FULL DAYS EARLIER BUT THE\nPUBLIC WAS NEVER TOLD.

GOOD TO HAVE YOU.\nLET'S FIRST TALK ABOUT THE FALLOUT FROM WHAT WE SAW TODAY.\nTHIS VIDEO, IF WE CAN SHOW IT OF HILLARY CLINTON BY THAT VAN\nSTUMBLING APPARENTLY LOSING HER FOOTING THERE.\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN NOT COMMENTING ABOUT HER HEALTH\nSITUATION AT THIS POINT BUT FROM WHAT WE SEE HERE AND THE FACT WE\nKNOW SHE WAS DIAGNOSED TWO DAYS BEFORE THIS WAS FINALLY REVEALED\nIT RAISES A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ISSUE OF TRANSPARENCY.\n>> THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS HABITUALLY RAISED THIS ISSUE OF\nSTAMINA AND PHYSICAL FITNESS FOR THE OFFICE.\nAND NOW THAT IT'S BEEN -- NOW THAT THERE IS SOME VIDEO\nEVIDENCE THAT IN THEIR MINDS PROBABLY CONFIRMS WHAT THEY'VE\nBEEN SAYING, IT DOESN'T BENEFIT THEM AT ALL TO PUSH IT FURTHER.\nIT'S THE SAME STRATEGY THAT TRUMP PURSUED WITH HIS BIRTHER\nCLAIMS BACK IN 2011. JUST ASKING QUESTIONS UNTIL IT\nBECOMES A MEDIA ISSUE AND THEN SORT OF STEPPING BACK AND SAYING\nI NEVER ACTUALLY SAID X OR Y. I JUST RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT\nIT. SO IT'S A CLEVER, IF SOMEWHAT\nUNDERHANDED STRATEGY THAT TRUMP IS USING IN RELATION TO THIS.\nBUT IT DOES POINT AS THE PREVIOUS SEGMENT INDICATED TO A\nREAL QUESTION OF TRANSPARENCY ON BOTH SIDES.\nNEE NEITHER CAMPAIGN HAS RELEASED\nTHE RECORDS PREVIOUS CAMPAIGNS HAVE.\nTHERE'S A LOWER AMOUNT OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE ABOUT\nEITHER OF THESE CANDIDATES THAN THERE WAS ABOUT OBAMA AND ROMNEY\nIN 2012 OR OBAM A AND McCAIN IN 2008.\n>> WHETHER DONALD TRUMP DECIDES TO PUSH ON THIS ISSUE OF HEALTH\nOR, AS YOU POINT OUT, IF HE JUST SITS BACK AND LETS THIS PLAY OUT\nAS IT WILL TO BECOME A MEDIA ISSUE, DOESN'T THIS ALSO EXPOSE\nDONALD TRUMP BECAUSE AS YOU ALSO M\nMENTIONED, HERE HAS NOT RELEASED HIS MEDICAL RECORDS.\nTHE BEST IS A COUPLE OF PARAGRAPHS, BIZARRELY WRITTEN\nSTATEMENT BY HIS PHYSICIAN. >> THAT MAY BE A CONTRIBUTORY\nFACTOR TO HIS UNCHARACTERISTIC SILENCE YESTERDAY AS WELL.\nHE OR HIS CAMPAIGN ARE AWARE THAT THIS ISN'T AN ISSUE WHERE\nTHEY CAN SORT OF SAFELY HURL ACCUSATIONS N NOT EXPECT SOME\nDEGREE OF QUESTIONS POINTED BACK AT THEM AS WELL.\n>> I WANT TO KNOW IF WE CAN ASK THE DIRECTOR TO SEE THAT\nSNAPSHOT OF THE RACE AS IT LOOKS NOW WITH LIKELY VOTERS.\nTHE LATEST POLL. WHEN YOU LOOK THERE, JACOB, THIS\nIS A PRETTY TIGHT RACE AND TIGHTENING AS WE MOVE ALONG\nGETTING CLOSER TO NOVEMBER. HILLARY CLINTON IS NOW CANCELING\nHER TRIP TO CALIFORNIA. FUND-RAISERS, VERY IMPORTANT\nFUND-RAISERS AND POSSIBLE RALLIES TO ACTUALLY SEE AND, YOU\nKNOW, BE FACE-TO-FACE WITH VOTERS.\nHOW SIGNIFICANT WILL THAT BE GIVEN WHERE WE ARE WITH THIS\nRACE? >> I DON'T THINK THAT IN AND OF\nITSELF IT'S PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT.\nTHE PROBLEM IS THAT AS YOU SAY, THIS IS A CLOSE RACE.\nAND I THINK WHAT WE HAVE SEEN FROM THE STATISTICAL EVIDENCE IS\nTHAT, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE POLLS THAT SHOW A LARGE CLINTON LEAD,\nA TIED RACE. WHAT THOSE AVERAGE OUT TO IS\nMAYBE THREE TO FIVE-POINT CLINTON LEAD.\nAND THAT'S BEEN FAIRLY CONSISTENT IF YOU SMOOTH IT OUT\nAS PEOPLE LIKE SAM WANG FROM THE ELECTION CONSORTIUM HAVE DONE.\nWHEN YOU SMOOTH OUT THE POLLS IT'S BEEN A CONSISTENT 2012\nELECTION STYLE, 3 TO 4 POINT LEAD FOR THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE.\nNOW THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY A GUARANTEE BECAUSE THE CAMPAIGNS\nDO NEED TO BE RAISING MONEY. THEY NEED TO BE DOING VOTER\nCONTACT. A LOT OF THAT HAPPENS\nINDEPENDENTLY OF THE NOMINEE'S PRESENCE ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\nA LOT OF IT DOESN'T. THE FUND-RAISING IN PARTICULAR\nREQUIRES FACE TIME FROM THE CANDIDATE.\nAND YOU NEED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC EYE AND SHAPING THE NARRATIVE TO\nSOME DEGREE. SO THIS MAY HAVE A MARGINAL\nIMPACT IF IT DRAGS ON, IF IT SORT OF PREVENTS HER FROM\nAPPEARING IN PUBLIC FOR A LENGTHY PERIOD.\nIN TERMS OF THE OVERALL STATE OF THE RACE, I WOULDN'T SAY IT'S\nGOING TO MAKE A LARGE DIFFERENCE.\n>> JACOB LIVE FOR US IN LONDON WITH CONTEXT ON THE LATEST\nPOLITICAL TWIST.

AND I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF\nWE WENT AND ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT, IT MIGHT BE THAT THE\nCANDIDATE HERSELF WAS A LITTLE RELUCTANT.\n>> I WOULD LIKE TO ADD ONE THING HERE, IF WE DO.\nAND THAT IS THAT HER LACK OF TRANSPARENCY, WHICH GOES BACK\nWAY BACK TO THE ARKANSAS YEARS, HAS FOR THE MOST PART SERVED HER\nAND BILL CLINTON WELL, WHICH IS TO SAY THEY HAVE WON.\nBUT THIS ELECTION CYCLE, IT HAS NOT SERVED HER WELL.\nIT HAS ALMOST BURIED HER. IT HAS MADE DONALD TRUMP A\nCREDIBLE POSSIBILITY FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES.\nAT LEAST IN TERMS OF THE NU NUMBERS.\nIT'S NOT WORKING. 4 HASN'T WORKED.\nAND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT SHE'S GOT AN OPPORTUNITY HERE TO\nCHANGE DIRECTIONS AT EXACTLY THE RIGHT MOMENT.\nPERHAPS NUDGED BY THIS INCIDENT.

THEY HAVEN'T ALWAYS CLAMORED FOR\nIT IN ELECTIONS PAST, BUT THERE'S A GREATER DESIRE WITH\nTHIS PARTICULAR ELECTION TO SEE THE HEALTH RECORDS.\nI THINK FROM WHAT'S HAPPENED TODAY, THAT INTEREST, THAT\nDESIRE MAY INCREASE EVEN MORE. >> DR. SANJAY GUPTA WITH US.\nSTAY WITH ME AS WE BRING IN OUR REPORTER WHO IS RIGHT OUTSIDE OF\nTHE HOME IN CHAPPAQUA WHERE HILLARY CLINTON WENT TODAY.\nM.J., YOU WERE WITH SECRETARY CLINTON ON FRIDAY, YOU WERE AT\nTHAT PRESS CONFERENCE THAT SHE HELD.\nSHE THEN SAT DOWN FOR AN INTERVIEW WITH OUR CHRIS CUOMO.\nAT SOME POINT ON FRIDAY, WE NOW KNOW FROM THE CAMPAIGN THEY KNEW\nSHE HAD THIS PNEUMONIA DIAGNOSE. IS IT ATYPICAL THAT THEY WOULD\nNOT TELL THE PUBLIC THAT UNTIL THIS HAPPENED THIS MORNING THAT\nCAUSED HER TO LEAVE THE 9/11 COMMEMORATION EARLY?\n>> WELL, I THINK THAT'S CERTAINLY ONE OF THE BIG\nQUESTIONS RIGHT NOW, POPPY. WHY IT IS THAT CLINTON'S DOCTOR\nDIAGNOSED HILLARY CLINTON WITH PNEUMONIA ON FRIDAY, BUT WE'RE\nREALLY ONLY LEARNING ABOUT THIS DIAGNOSIS TODAY ON SUNDAY, TWO\nDAYS LATER. AND I THINK SANJAY WAS MAKING\nTHE POINT A LITTLE BIT EARLIER THAT PERHAPS WE WOULDN'T HAVE\nEVEN FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS DIAGNOSIS HAD SHE NOT HAD THIS\nSTUMBLE AT THE 9/11 MEMORIAL. WE SAW THAT VIDEO OF HER\nSTUMBLING AS SHE GOT INTO THE VAN.\nSHE HAD TO BE HELPED AS SHE WAS GETTING INSIDE THE CAR.\nAND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS HAVE TOLD CNN THAT SHE DID\nAPPEAR TO FAINT. TO BE CLEAR, THIS IS NOT\nINFORMATION THAT'S COMING FROM THE CAMPAIGN.\nTHIS IS INFORMATION THAT'S COMING FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT\nOFFICIALS. BUT CLEARLY AS HER DOCTOR STATED\nHERSELF, HILLARY CLINTON WAS OVERHEATED, DEHYDRATED AND SHE\nHAD TO BE TREATED FOR THAT. AND ON TOP OF THAT ON FRIDAY,\nSHE LEARNED THAT SHE HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA.\nON FRIDAY SHE HAD A VERY BUSY SCHEDULE.\nSHE HAD A MEETING WITH NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISERS AND EXPERTS IN\nTHE MORNING, THEN HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE, THEN HEADED OFF TO A\nFUND-RAISER AFTER SITTING DOWN WITH CNN'S CHRIS CUOMO.\nSO THAT'S A VERY PACKED DAY. AND AS JEFF ZELENY REPORTED\nEARLIER, SOME QUESTIONS ARE STARTING TO COME UP WITHIN THE\nCAMPAIGN AS TO WHY SHE DIDN'T CLEAR UP HER SCHEDULE MORE AND\nWHY SHE HAD SUCH A PACKED SCHEDULE WHEN SHE KNEW THAT\nTHERE WERE THESE CONCERNS OUT THERE ABOUT HER HEALTH?\n>> YOU'RE IN CHAPPAQUA. THE LAST STATEMENT WE GOT FROM\nTHE CLINTON CAMP OUTSIDE OF THIS DOCTOR STATEMENT, HER PERSONAL\nDOCTOR STATEMENT, WAS NICK MERRILL HOURS AGO 90 MINUTES\nAFTER SHE LEFT THE 9/11 COMMEMORATION CEREMONY SAYING\nSHE OVERHEATED, SHE WENT TO HER DAUGHTER'S APARTMENT, SHE'S\nFEELING MUCH BETTER. HAVE WE HEARD ANYTHING FROM THE\nCLINTON CAMP OR HAVE YOU SEEN ANYTHING IN CHAPPAQUA, HER\nCOMING OUT OF HER HOME, ET CETERA, ANYTHING SINCE THEN?\n>> IT'S PRETTY MUCH BUSINESS AS USUAL HERE.\nTHE SECRET SERVICE ARE POSITIONED OUTSIDE OF HER HOME,\nAS THEY ALWAYS ARE. CLINTON CAME HOME THIS\nAFTERNOON. HAS NOT LEFT SINCE.\nAT SOME POINT HER DOCTOR CAME TO THE HOUSE, CHECKED HER OUT AND\nTHEN THE STATEMENT CAME OUT. AND THE STATEMENT CAME OUT FROM\nTHE DOCTOR. BUT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS, AS\nJEFF ZELENY, AND WE'VE BEEN REPORTING ALL AFTERNOON, IS\nGAUGING WHETHER HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN OVERSCHEDULED, WHETHER\nSHE'S DOING TOO MUCH. A DIAGNOSIS OF PNEUMONIA ON\nFRIDAY. SHE CONTINUED WITH HER DAY.\nMULTIPLE FUND-RAISERS, A BIG NATIONAL SECURITY MEETING.\nSHE'S A CANDIDATE WHO HAS TO APPEAR AT FUND-RAISERS TO RAISE\nBIG MONEY. SHE APPEARED AT ALMOST 40\nFUND-RAISERS IN AUGUST. AND WHILE THAT WAS A HEAVY MONTH\nFOR HER, IT ALLOWED HER TO RAISE A TON OF MONEY.\nTHIS IS SOMEBODY WHO -- IT'S A TIME CRUNCH -- IT'S A LOT OF\nTIME FOR HER TO COMMIT TO FUND-RAISING AND A LOT OF\nENERGY. SO NO, NO CHANGE HERE.\nIT LOOKS LIKE IT ALWAYS DOES. SHE'S IN HER HOUSE.\nWE'RE TOLD SHE'S NOT MOVING FOR THE REST OF THE DAY, BUT THEY'RE\nSTILL TOYING WHERE WHETHER THEY'LL CANCEL A BIG WEEK OR\nPART OF A BIG WEEK OF EVENTS. SHE'S SUPPOSED TO FLY TO\nCALIFORNIA, HER AND HER PRESS POOL ON HER NEW PLANE ARE\nSUPPOSED TO FLY TO CALIFORNIA. THAT'S IN QUESTION.\nDOES SHE GO TO L.A. ON TUESDAY WHERE SHE HAS TWO FUND-RAISERS\nAND A SPEECH? THAT'S IN QUESTION.\nSHE DIDN'T TAKE NECESSARILY THE PNEUMONIA DIAGNOSIS SERIOUSLY ON\nFRIDAY BECAUSE SHE CONTINUED WITH HER SCHEDULE.\nWHAT HAPPENED AT THE 9/11 MEMORIAL SEEMS TO HAVE ELEVATED\nTHINGS AND THEY'RE TAKING THIS MORE SERIOUSLY NOW.\n>> JEFF ZELENY WAS REPORTING LAST HOUR THAT THE TEAM IS\nMAKING A SERIOUS EVALUATION OF HER, HER TRAVEL SCHEDULE GOING\nFORWARD. BUT HE MADE AN IMPORTANT POINT\nWHEN HE COMPARED WHAT WE KNOW AND DON'T KNOW ABOUT THESE\nCANDIDATES, DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH HISTORY\nCOMPARED TO PREVIOUS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES.\nHE POINTED OUT THAT, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE OLDER CANDIDATES IN\nRACES, JOHN McCAIN. WE KNEW A LOT MORE ABOUT JOHN\nMcCAIN'S HEALTH THAN WE DO ABOUT THESE TWO CANDIDATES WHICH ARE\nTHE OLDEST TO RUN. >> THAT'S RIGHT.\nAND THE HEALTH OF BOTH DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON HAVE\nBECOME POLITICAL ISSUES THIS CAMPAIGN CYCLE ESPECIALLY\nBECAUSE THEY'RE OLDER CANDIDATES.\nTHAT IS JUST THE TRUTH. AND I THINK BOTH DONALD TRUMP\nAND THE FACT THAT HE AND HIS SURROGATES HAVE BEEN PUSHING\nHILLARY CLINTON TO RELEASE MORE INFORMATION HAVE IN TURN PUT\nPRESSURE ON THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN TO BE AGGRESSIVE ABOUT ASKING\nDONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN TO RELEASE MORE INFORMATION.\nAND I THINK IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT AT THIS POINT WE HAVE A\nLITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S RECENT\nSTATE OF HEALTH THAN DONALD TRUMP.\nTHE ONLY THING THAT WE'VE GOTTEN SO FAR FROM DONALD TRUMP'S\nCAMPAIGN IS THIS LETTER THAT HIS DOCTOR ACKNOWLEDGED AFTERWARDS,\nTOOK HIM FIVE MINUTES TO WRITE. THERE WAS A CAR WAITING OUTSIDE.\nSOME OF THE LANGUAGE IN THAT LETTER, OF COURSE, HAS COME INTO\nQUESTION. FOR EXAMPLE, THE DOCTOR STATED\nTHAT HE COULD STATE UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT DONALD TRUMP\nWOULD BE THE HEALTHIEST PRESIDENT TO HAVE EVER EXISTED\nIN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. I THINK FOR BOTH CAMPAIGNS,\nTHERE'S GOING TO BE PRESSURE TO RELEASE MORE INFORMATION.\nI REALLY DO THINK AT THIS POINT TRANSPARENCY IS A KEY WORD.\nAND ESPECIALLY FOR THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN.\nTHEY UNDERSTAND VERY WELL THAT THE ISSUE OF TRANSPARENCY AND\nTHEN THE SEPARATE ISSUE OF HONEST ES AND TRUSTWORTHINESS,\nALL OF THESE ISSUES ARE POTENTIAL VULNERABILITIES FOR\nHER. THE FACT THAT SHE WAS DIAGNOSED\nWITH PNEUMONIA ON FRIDAY AND THEN FOR WHATEVER REASON CHOSE\nNOT TO DISCLOSE THAT INFORMATION, THAT COULD\nPOTENTIALLY RAISE SOME QUESTIONS.\n>> THANK YOU SO MUCH. ALSO OUR THANKS TO DR. SANJAY\nGUPTA. WE'LL TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND\nMORE ON THIS BREAKING NEWS. HILLARY CLINTON DIAGNOSED WITH\nPNEUMONIA ON FRIDAY. THE PUBLIC HAS JUST LEARNED\nABOUT IT TODAY. NOW THE CAMPAIGN AIDES SAYING\nTHAT THEY'RE EVALUATING WHETHER OR NOT SHE WILL CONTINUE ON THIS\nPLANNED TRIP TO CALIFORNIA. SHE WAS SET TO LEAVE FOR LOS\nANGELES TOMORROW. WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN 58 DAYS\nOUT FROM THE LEAKED? YOU'RE LIVE IN THE CNN NEWSROOM.          Hmmmmmm.....",

HE HAS NOT TWEETED.\nHIS CAMPAIGN HAS NOT RELEASED A STATEMENT AT ALL.\nTHIS DESPITE THE FACT THAT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS SOME TRUMP TOP\nSURROGATES AND EVEN HIMSELF HAVE QUESTIONED HER HEALTH AND HER\nSTAMINA. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT ALL THIS AND\nTHE OPTICS AND THE CAMPAIGN. CNN SENIOR CORRESPONDENT BRIAN\nSTELTER IS WITH ME AND LONNIE CHEN IS WITH ME.\nHE'S THE PUBLIC POLICY DIRECTOR FOR MITT ROMNEY.\nSO NICE TO HAVE YOU BOTH WITH US.\nBRIAN, AS THE MEDIA EXPERT IN ALL OF THIS, HOW DOES THIS LAY?\nWHAT ARE THE HEADLINES TOMORROW MORNING?\nWHEN ARE WE GOING TO HEAR FROM DONALD TRUMP?\n>> I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN WHY TRUMP HASN'T WEIGHED IN.\nPOLITICALLY IT MAKES SENSE. WHY WOULD HE?\nTHERE'S NOTHING HE NEEDS TO STAY RIGHT NOW.\nTHIS IS BEING DRIFB BY THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN.\nIT WILL ALSO BE DRIVEN TOMORROW AS TO WHETHER CLINTON MAKES THAT\nFUND-RAISING TRIP OR NOT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE OF THE\nMOST FAMOUS PEOPLE IN THE WORLD HERE.\nONE OF THE MOST SCRUTINIZED PEOPLE IN THE WORLD.\nHILLARY CLINTON SOMETIMES RESENTS THAT SCRUTINY.\nSOMETIMES SHE TRIES TO HOLD THINGS BACK.\nTHAT CAUSES REPORTERS TO GET MORE CURIOUS, MORE FRUSTRATED,\nTHEN SHE GETS MORE RESENTFUL. THERE'S A VICIOUS CYCLE IN PLAY\nIN SITUATIONS LIKE TODAY WHERE WE DON'T FEEL LIKE IN THE MEDIA\nWE'RE GETTING ENOUGH INFORMATION FROM THE CAMPAIGN.\nIN TURN, THE CAMPAIGN FEELS LIKE THEY'RE UNDER FIRE FROM THE\nMEDIA. I THINK CLINTON SUPPORTERS\nWATCHING THIS RIGHT NOW ARE VERY FRUSTRATED BY ALL OF THAT.\nTHERE'S A LOT OF IMPORTANT SUBTEXT TO ALL THIS.\nOTHER THAN THIS ONE IMAGE, WE HAVEN'T SEEN CLINTON AND\nREPORTERS WILL CONTINUE TO ASK LEGITIMATE QUESTIONS.\n>> THERE'S THIS IMAGE AND THEN SHOT BY SOMEONE IN THE CROWD OF\nHER SORT OF STUMBLING, HELPED BY SECRET SERVICE INTO THE VAN.\nTHAT'S A TROUBLING IMAGE FOR THE CAMPAIGN.\nLONNIE, LET ME ASK YOU THIS. YOU WORKED ON MITT ROMNEY'S\nTEAM. YOU WORKED ON ISSUES LIKE THIS\nAND YOU KNOW HOW IMPORTANT OPTICS ARE ESPECIALLY 58 DAYS\nOUT. CLINTON'S DOCTOR JUST CAME OUT\nWITH A STAPT AND SAID IN A STATEMENT THAT HILLARY CLINTON\nWAS DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA ON FRIDAY, AND WE WERE NOT TOLD\nABOUT IT UNTIL TODAY. IT RAISES THE QUESTION OF\nWHETHER THE PUBLIC WOULD HAVE BEEN TOLD ABOUT IT AT ALL OR IF\nTHEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN. IF THIS HADN'T HAPPENED.\nIS THIS PROBLEMATIC FOR THE CAMPAIGN NA THE DIAGNOSIS CAME\nTWO DAYS AGO. >> YEAH, POPPY, THIS IS ONE OF\nTHOSE SITUATIONS WHERE, AS YOU MIGHT SAY, THE COVER-UP IS WORSE\nTHAN THE CRIME. I MEAN, LOOK, THE REALITY IS\nTHAT THESE ARE NORMAL HEALTH SITUATIONS.\nTHESE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES WORK EXTREMELY HARD HAVING SEEN\nTHIS UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL WITH GOVERNOR ROMNEY, HOW HARD HE\nWORKED ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. IN 2012 HEALTH WASN'T THE ISSUE\nBECAUSE BOTH GOVERNOR ROMNEY AND PRESIDENT OBAMA WERE IN SUPERB\nHEALTH. THIS TIME AROUND OBVIOUSLY THE\nAGE OF CANDIDATES HAS BECOME AN ISSUE.\nFOR HILLARY CLINTON THEIR CAMPAIGN NEEDS TO ERR ON THE\nSIDE OF TRANSPARENCY. AS BRIAN WAS SAYING GOING\nFOR FORWARD.\nTHEY DON'T NEED TO FUEL THIS ANY MORE THAN THE MEDIA OR THE\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN THEMSELVES ARE ALREADY FUELING IT.\nTRUMP SITS BACK AND CONTINUES TO DRIVE HIS MESSAGE.\nHE DOESN'T EVEN NEED TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THIS, FRANKLY.\nBY THE WAY, THIS WOULD BE A GREAT TIME FOR HIM TO RELEASE\nMEDICAL RECORDS TO SAY I'M PUTTING MY MEDICAL RECORDS OUT\nTHERE. HILLARY CLINTON, THE BALL'S IN\nYOUR COURT. >> OR FOR HIM TO TAKE THE HIGH\nROAD. I THINK WE SHOULD BE HONEST\nABOUT THE SUBTEXT OF THIS TODAY. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FIRST\nFEMALE NOMINEE OF A MAJOR PARTY IN AMERICAN HISTORY.\nDONALD TRUMP TRYING TO SHOW HIS STRENGTH.\nHILLARY CLINTON ALSO TRYING TO SHOW HER STRENGTH.\nIF SHE HAD PNEUMONIA AND SHE WENT TO THE 9/11 CEREMONY THIS\nMORNING, THAT'S A VERY STRONG, BOLD THING TO DO.\nALSO KNOWING THAT TRUMP WAS GOING TO BE THERE.\nWE SHOULD BE HONEST ABOUT THE DOUBLE STANDARDS THAT WOMEN\nSOMETIMES FACE WITH REGARDS TO THEIR HEALTH.\nPORTRAYED AS BEING WEAKER THAN MEN.\nHOW SHE HAVE TO WORK HARDER TO SHOW THEY'RE AS STRONG AS MEN\nESPECIALLY IN WORKPLACES, ESPECIALLY IN POLITICS.\nI THINK WE SHOULD BE HONEST WITH OURSELVES ABOUT SOME OF THE\nSUBTEXT HERE EVEN AS WE RIGHTLY SCRUTINIZE HER HEALTH TODAY.\n>> BUT GIVEN THE CONTEXT THAT SHE IS COMING OFF OF WEEKS AND\nWEEKS OF DONALD TRUMP AND HIS SUPPORTERS SAYING WHERE IS\nHILLARY CLINTON?

BUT YOU NOTED, JEFF, THAT WE\nKNOW LESS, YOU SAID TO ME JUST A FEW MOMENTS AGO, ABOUT HILLARY\nCLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP IN TERMS OF THEIR HEALTH.\nWE HAVE A NUMBER OF OTHER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES KNOWN\nABOUT THEM IN THE PAST. HOW SO?\n>> IT'S REALLY STRIKING, HILLARY CLINTON 68 YEARS OLD, DONALD\nTRUMP A YEAR OLDER THAN THAT. HILLARY JUST TURNED 69 IN A\nMONTH'S TIME. THEY'RE THE OLDEST CANDIDATES\nAND WHOEVER GOES INTO OFFICE WILL, IN FACT, BE THE OLDEST\nPRESIDENT. IN THE RANGE OF RONALD REAGAN\nBUT SLIGHTLY OLDER, I BELIEVE, IF MY MATH IS CORRECT, AND WE\nKNOW LESS ABOUT THEIR HEALTH RECORDS THAN RECENT PRESIDENTIAL\nNOMINEES. NOT IN TIME.\nOF COURSE, THERE HAVE BEEN PRESIDENTS WHO HAVE KEPT THEIR\nHEALTH OFFICIALS SECRETIVE OVER THE YEARS AS WE KNOW FROM\nHISTORY, FDR AND OTHERS. BUT IN RECENT PRESIDENTIAL\nCAMPAIGNS FROM JOHN McCAIN TO GEORGE W. BUSH TO BARACK OBAMA\nTO MITT ROCMNEY TO GEORGE H.W. BUSH AND OTHERS, DUKAKIS AND\nOTHERS, THEY HAVE RELEASED FULL MEDICAL RECORDS.\nIN THIS CASE THAT ISN'T THE CASE.\nHILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN MORE FORTHCOMING THAN DONALD TRUMP.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS RELEASED A LETTER FROM HIS DOCTOR THAT WAS\nVIEWED WITH SUSPICION BY MANY A MEDICAL WORKER WHO SAID HE WOULD\nBE THE HEALTHIEST PRESIDENT OF ALL TIME, BUT HILLARY CLINTON\nHAS ONLY RELEASED A STATEMENT FROM HER DOCTOR, HAS NOT\nRELEASED MEDICAL RECORDS. WE DO KNOW SHE WAS TREATED FOR\nTHAT BLOOD CLOT AT THE END OF HER TERM AS SECRETARY OF STATE\nIN HER TERM, 2013, AND WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED MEDICAL RECORDS\nTHAT HAVE ALLOWED EXPERTS LIKE DR. SANJAY GUPTA TO LOOK AT\nTHEM. JOHN McCAIN INVITED PEOPLE TO\nCOME INTO A ROOM IN ARIZONA TO INSPECT THE RECORDS FOR A COUPLE\nHOURS. THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED IN THIS\nCASE. AMERICAN VOTERS KNOW LESS ABOUT\nTHE HEALTH AND VITALITY OF EITHER NOMINEE AT THIS POINT,\nAND THEY'RE THE OLDEST NOMINEES OF ANYONE IN OUR HISTORY.\nIT IS SOMETHING TO TAKE NOTE OF ON BOTH SIDES, THAT WE SIMPLY\nHAVE BEEN GIVEN LESS INFORMATION.\nIN AN ERA THAT TRANSPARENCY IS CALLED UPON, WE DON'T HAVE THAT\nINFORMATION, AND KNOWING SHE WAS DIAGNOSED FRIDAY, SHE WILL HAVE\nTO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS THAT WILL HAVE TO BE ANSWERED IN THE\nNEXT SEVERAL DAYS. >> YOU SAID TO ME THAT IT'S A\nGOOD IDEA FOR BOTH CANDIDATES TO RELEASE THEIR MEDICAL RECORDS,\nJUST TO BE FULLY TRANSPARENT WITH THE PUBLIC, BUT YOU ALSO\nNOTED SOMETHING IMPORTANT, THAT BOTH THESE CANDIDATES HAVE BEEN\nEXAMINED BY THEIR PERSONAL DOCTORS, NOT AN INDEPENDENT\nBOARD OF PHYSICIANS. >> IT'S A POINT THAT'S COME UP\nIN THE PAST AS WELL, NOT JUST WITH THESE TWO CANDIDATES.\nMR. BRINKLEY BROUGHT THIS POINT UP AS WELL.\nTHE FACT THERE IS A FRIENDSHIP STILL WITHIN THESE PERSONAL\nDOCTORS AND THESE CANDIDATES. CERTAINLY WITH DR. TRUMP'S\nDOCTOR'S LETTER, TALKING ABOUT HIM BEING THE HEALTHIEST\nPRESIDENT EVER, IT WAS JUST IN GLOWING TERMS.\nIT WASN'T AN OBJECTIVE LETTER. I THINK THE PUBLIC DESERVES\nOBJECTIVE LETTERS ON BOTH SIDES, OBJECTIVE INFORMATION AS TO THE\nSORT OF EDITORIAL THING THAT MIGHT COME FROM SOMEONE WHO HAS\nA SORT OF FRIENDSHIP CONNECTION. SO THE IDEA OF SOMEONE HAVING A\nBOARD OF DOCTORS OR ALLOWING MEDICAL RECORDS TO BE SEEN EVEN\nBY A GROUP OF REPORTERS, I THINK, IS IMPORTANT.\nI THINK DOCTORS AND JOURNALISTS ARE SIMILAR IN THIS WAY, POPPY,\nYOU ALWAYS WANT TO GET MORE INFORMATION, CERTAINLY.\nHAVING A DIAGNOSIS ON A FRIDAY AND JUST HEARING ABOUT IT ON\nSUNDAY AFTER AN EPISODE, THE SORT OF FEEL IS THAT YOU MAY NOT\nHAVE HEARD ABOUT IT, AFTER IT WAS SORT OF FORCED UPON.\nAND I THINK THE SORT OF INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT TO\nKNOW. IT'S AN EMINENTLY TREATABLE\nDIAGNOSIS. THAT'S THE SORT OF THING A LOT\nOF PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO KNOW. >> ABSOLUTELY, SANJAY.\nDR. SANJAY GUPTA, STAY WITH US. JEFF ZELANY WORKING HIS SOURCES\nON THIS AS WELL. STAY WITH US, WE HAVE A LOT MORE\nAHEAD. THIS IS POLITICAL.\nWE ARE 58 DAYS AWAY FROM THE ELECTION, SO HOW COULD AN ISSUE\nWITH CLINTON'S HEALTH -- WE NOW KNOW SHE'S BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH\nPNEUMONIA -- HOW COULD THAT AFFECT HER IN TERMS OF THE\nOPTICS OF ALL OF THIS. LET'S TALK ABOUT IT WITH JOSH\nKING. HE'S THE FOUNDER OF THE.\n>> SHE'S NAPPING, WHERE IS SHE, WHERE IS THE ENERGY, THEY POINT\nTO A COUGHING EPISODE, IF YOU WILL.\nTHE FACTS ARE THE FACTS. WHAT WE KNOW IS SHE OVERHEATED\nAND WE KNOW FROM HER DOCTOR SHE HAS PNEUMONIA.\nBUT IF SHE DOESN'T GET ON THAT PLANE TOMORROW TO CALIFORNIA,\nWHAT ARE THE OPTIONS FOR HER AND HER CAMPAIGN?\n>> WELL, POPPY, A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN IN THE LAST 18 MONTHS\nIS THE MOST GRUELING IMAGINABLE. THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE WITH\nCANDIDATES 67 AND 68 YEARS OLD. WE HAVEN'T SEEN THIS SINCE 1981\nWHEN PRESIDENT REAGAN TOOK OFFICE.\nPRESIDENT CLINTON, PRESIDENT BUSH, PRESIDENT OBAMA, THESE ARE\nPEOPLE IN THEIR LATE 40s, EARLY 50 YEARS OLD, MUCH MORE VIGOROUS\nAND READY TO GO FOR THIS 18-MONTH MARATHON.\nTHESE CANDIDATES ARE GOING TO HAVE HEALTH ISSUES AS THEY GO\nTHROUGH THE FINAL 58 DAYS OF THE CAMPAIGN AND FOR THE NEXT FOUR\nYEARS. THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE WHEN WE\nHAVE 70-YEAR-OLD PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY.\nSO FOR SECRETARY CLINTON NOW TO TAKE A FEW DAYS OFF, IF THAT'S\nWHAT SHE HAS TO DO, IT'S NOT BENEFICIAL TO HER BUT YOU CAN\nIMAGINE THAT BY THE END OF THE WEEK, SHE'LL BE BACK AT\nMAINTAINING THE SAME VIGOROUS SCHEDULE SHE'S HAD FOR THE LAST\n15 OR SO MONTHS. WE'LL SEE IF SHE GETS ON THAT\nPLANE OR NOT. IF YOU LOOK AT PRESIDENT CARTER\nSTUMBLING AFTER PRESIDENT REAGAN, PRESIDENT BUSH VOMITING\nIN THE LAP OF PRIME MINISTER, ITIZAWA, PRESIDENT CLINTON\nSTEPPING ONTO GREG NORMAN'S HOUSE AND HAVING A LATE-NIGHT\nRUN TO THE HOSPITAL. THESE ARE WHAT HAPPENS TO\nCANDIDATES. DOES IT TAKE A NEW CAMPAIGN FIVE\nMINUTES TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEIR GOING TO SAY OR SHARE WITH\nMEDIA? THEY NEED TO FIGURE OUT THIS\nCAMPAIGN THIS CLOSELY. >> AT THE SAME TIME, WHAT DO YOU\nMAKE OF THE SILENCE? WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING THAT\nHE'S CERTAINLY BEEN OUTSPOKEN ON HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH, AND\nHE'S TALKED ABOUT HER BEING OFF THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\nHE SAYS SHE HASN'T BEEN. WHAT DO YOU MAKE NOTE OF THE\nNOTABLE SILENCE. >> AS DR. GUPTA SAID, A\n68-YEAR-OLD PERSON STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF A CEREMONY IN\nLOWER MANHATTAN IN A FULL PANT SUIT CAN OVERHEAT.\nYOU CAN HAVE A TOUCH OF PNEUMONIA AND NOT FEEL WELL, AND\nTHEN YOU CAN MOVE ON THE NEXT DAY AND CONTINUE WITH YOUR\nSCHEDULE. I THINK WE CAN BE QUICK TO JUDGE\nTHE SEVERITY OF THIS AND B BASICALLY COME MONDAY, TUESDAY,\nWE CAN BE BACK WITH OUR NORMAL SCHEDULE.\n>> I WAS OUT THIS MORNING. IT WAS VERY HOT, VERY HUMID AND\nVERY UNCOMFORTABLE. WE'VE LEARNED A LOT IN THE LAST\nHOUR. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING\nUS.",

IF YOU HAVE A CANDIDATE OFF THE\nTRIAL AND YOU'RE IN A RACE, THE TIMING IS VERY KRURL HERE\nBECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IF HE'S GOING  JEFF ZELANY JUST REPORTED THAT\nWE KNOW LESS ABOUT THESE TWO CANDIDATES, WHO ARE THE LESS OF\nTHE CANDIDATES.

SHOULD SHE PUT HER MEDICAL\nRECORDS OUT THERE? >> I THINK BEING TRANSPARENT IS\nSUPER IMPORTANT, AND IF THAT'S WHAT DONALD TRUMP WILL DO AND\nTHAT'S WHAT THE HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN WANTS TO DO, THEN THEY\nSHOULD DO IT. I THINK IT'S A FAIR ISSUE,\nTHOUGH. BUT I'M NOT SURE PNEUMONIA OR\nCOLD OR FLU WOULD EVEN BE IN HER MEDICAL RECORDS, NOR DOES IT TIE\nINTO A LONG-TERM MEDICAL CONDITION THAT THEY'RE HAVING\nPUTTING ON THE INTERNET. .\nZDS IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, POPPY, SHE SAID SHE WOULD DO THAT.\n>> I THINK THEY'RE SAYING, IF YOU RELEASE YOURS, I'LL RELEASE\nMINE. DON'T THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\nDESERVE TO KNOW? >> WE'RE GETTING THIS VIDEO\nTODAY FROM HILLARY CLINTON AND IT'S NOT THE FIRST.\nTHAT'SLY REAL PROBLEM? >> THE KEY QUESTION, THOUGH.\nYOU'RE A. THAT'S HIS DECISION.\nWHAT CAN I TELL YOU? >> POPPY, WE'D LIKE TO HAVE A\nMORE DETAILED MEDICAL LETTER. WE CAN START WITH THAT, QUITE\nFRANKLY, BECAUSE HIS MEDICAL LETTER TELLS US NOTHING ABOUT\nHIS HEALTH. THE LETTER FROM HER DOCTOR\nLONGER AND MORE DETAIL. WE'RE GOING TAUG ABOUT KEY STATE\nIN THIS RACE, WHAT IT MEANS IN THE SWING STATES.\nWHAT HAPPENED TO HILLARY CLINTON AFTER HER BIG LEAD AT THE\nCONVENTION? ALL OF THAT STRAIGHT AHEAD.",

SHE SORT OF STUMBLES, AND W\nWOBBLES A BIT. SHE DID COME OUT AND SPEAK TO\nTHE PRESS SAYING QUOTE, SHE FEELS GREAT.\nBUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE OPTICS OF THIS, 60 DAYS AWAY,\nTHERE ARE QUESTIONS PEOPLE HAVE. LET'S BRING IN OUR COMNN\nCORRESPONDENT FROM AUSTIN, TEXAS, ALL WE KNOW IS FROM HER\nCAMPAIGN SHE OVERHEATED. TWO LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCES ARE\nTELLING CNN THAT SHE APPEARS TO HAVE FAINTED.\nBUT AGAIN, THAT IS NOT CONFIRMED BY HER DOCTOR OR CAMPAIGN.\nWHAT DOES HISTORY TEACH US ABOUT HOW CONCERNED VOTERS ARE ABOUT\nTHE HEALTH OF THE CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR THE WHITE HOUSE?\n>> Reporter: WELL, WE'RE CONCERNED, BUT WE'RE A COUNTRY\nTHAT ELECTED FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT FOUR TIMES WHEN WE KNOW HE HAD\nPOLIO FOUR TIMES, WHEELCHAIR-BOUND.\nSO THERE IS A REASONABLE PERSPECTIVE.\nTHIS IS NOT A BIG EVENT THAT OCCURRED IN MY MIND TODAY.\nHILLARY CLINTON DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.\nSHE HAS BEEN CHRIS-CROSSING THE COUNTRY, I DON'T KNOW HOW ANY OF\nTHESE CANDIDATES DO IT. AND SHE IS OUT IN EXTREME HEAT.\nGOT A LITTLE BIT DIZZY. AND THERE WAS AN AWKWARD MOMENT.\nBUT THERE ARE TIMES IN U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS WHEN\nTHERE IS A BAD VIDEO BITE WHEN WE SEE HER STUMBLING INTO HER\nCAR, WHERE IT CAUSES PAIN. AND SHE NEEDS TO BE CLEAR WHAT\nHAPPENED AND TRY TO EXPLAIN TO THE PUBLIC WHAT IT IS.\n>> AND DR. SANJAY GUPTA, OUR CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT,\nSAID LOOK IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA FOR THE CANDIDATES TO\nRELEASE THEIR HEALTH RECORDS AND FRANKLY HAVE AN INDEPENDENT\nBOARD OF DOCTORS WHO RELEASE THEIR INFORMATION, WHO YOU OFTEN\nBECOME FRIENDS WITH. WHAT IS THE HISTORICAL PRECEDENT\nFOR THAT, OR IS THERE NONE TO GET HEALTH RECORDS FOR\nCANDIDATES? >> WELL, I AGREE WITH HIM THAT\nWOULD BE IDEAL. BUT WE'RE ALSO VERY LATE IN THE\nGAME RIGHT NOW. THERE ARE TIMES WHEN CANDIDATES'\nHEALTHS JUST CAUSES BIG PROBLEMS.\nI MEAN THINK ABOUT THOMAS EAGLETON, RUNNING FOR CANDIDATE.\nHE HAD A BACKGROUND OF MENTAL ILLNESS, IT EVENTUALLY BROKE\nLOOSE. IT COST GEORGE McGOVERN TERRIBLY\nTO NOT BE TRANSPARENT ON THAT. I REMEMBER IN 1992, WHEN GEORGE\nHERBERT BUSH THREW UP ON A JAP\nJAPANESE VISITOR. SO THAT BITE WAS VERY HAUNTING.\nI THINK WE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF SOMEBODY\nRUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. THESE CANDIDATES ALL HAVE THEIR\nOWN DOCTORS WHO WILL SAY THEY'RE FIT AS A FIDDLE.\nIT'S IMPORTANT FOR HILLARY CLINTON NOT TO DO WHAT JOHN\nKENNEDY DID IN 1962 AND TRY TO HIDE A CONDITION.\nSHE NEEDS TO BE TRANSPARENT WHERE SHE IS AT, WHAT HAPPENED\nWITH HER CONCUSSION AND JUST BE FRANK WITH WHAT HAPPENED.\nSHE NEEDS TO GET ON A PLANE AND GO TO SAN FRANCISCO AND KEEP GET\nON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, OR WILL THIS MAKE HER CANCEL?\nWE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE. >> WHY DO YOU SAY IT'S KEY IF\nSHE GETS ON THE PLANE. IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT -- THESE\nCANDIDATES ARE FLYING ACROSS THE COUNTRY BACK AND FORTH AND\nCLEARLY WHAT THEY DO IS EXHAUSTING.\nARE YOU SAYING SHE HAS TO GET ON THAT PLANE OR ELSE THE OPTICS\nARE JUST GOING TO BE TOO TOUGH FOR HER?\n>> WELL, IF SHE IS NOT GOING TO INVITE A DOCTOR TO CHAPPAQUA,\nFOR THE GET BAGS OF FLUID IF SHE WAS DEHYDRATED AND REALLY WAS\nJUST FINE, FELT DIZZY, THAT MEANS SHE WOULD BE ONWARD TO\nCALIFORNIA. BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO FEED INTO\nTHE CAMPAIGN'S NOTION THAT SHE IS UNFIT TO COMMAND AND SHE HAS\nBEEN COVERING UP HER HEALTH WOES FOR A WHILE, SO IF SHE CAN GET\nON THAT PLANE TOMORROW, I CERTAINLY WOULD DO IT.\n>> DOUGLAS HINCKLEY THANK YOU.",

WE BRING IN OUR POLITICAL PANEL\nTO DISCUSS TODAY'S DEVELOPMENTS. LARRY SABATEAU FROM THE\nUNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, JOSH ROGEN, COLUMNIST FOR \"THE\nWASHINGTON POST.\" JOSH SHE CERTAINLY LOOKED FINE\nWHEN SHE LEFT CHELSEA CLINTON'S APARTMENT IN NEW YORK CITY, SHE\nWAS SMILING, WAVING, SAID SHE FELT GREAT, BUT THIS DOES RAISE\nQUESTIONS ABOUT HER HEALTH. HOW SHOULD SHE AND HER CAMPAIGN\nADDRESS THIS? >> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.\nWE JUST DON'T HAVE ANY EVIDENCE THIS IS A SERIOUS HEALTH\nINCIDENT IN AND OF ITSELF. WE DON'T HAVE THE FACTS, BUT THE\nIMPLICATION OF THIS IS CLEAR. LAST WEEK IN NEWSROOMS ALL OVER\nTHE COUNTRY EDITORS AND COLUMN IS AND REPORTERS WERE THINKING\nWHAT SHOULD WE DO ABOUT THE GROWING CONSPIRACY THEORIES,\nMENTIONS OF THE INTERNATIONAL ON THE HEALTH.\nNOW THE STORY IS MAINSTREAMED. THIS WILL BE PART OF THE DEBATE.\nIT WILL BE PART OF THE ELECTION AND IT WILL BE PART OF OUR\nPOLITICS FOR THE NEXT 58 DAYS OR WHATEVER.\nSO WHAT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS TO DO IS INTERNALIZE THAT, AND\nDEAL WITH IT, AND DEAL WITH IT AS UP FRONT AND AS\nTRANSPARENTALLY AS THEY CAN. IN 2012 SHE MADE THIS MISTAKE.\nSHE HAD THESE HEALTH PROBLEMS, SHE WAS COY ABOUT IT, THEY A\nAVOIDED TALKING ABOUT THE FACTS. TOOK THEM THREE YEARS TO TALK\nABOUT IT. THEY CAN'T DO THAT, DON'T HAVE\nTHAT TIME SO THEY HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT THIS IS NOW A THING AND\nTHEY HAVE TO TRY TO MINIMIZE THE DAMAGE.\n>> I ASSUME LARRY YOU AGREE THOSE CONSPIRACY THEORIES OUT\nTHERE IS NOW GOING TO ESCALATE PRETTY DRAMATICALLY.\nHOW DO YOU THINK THE CAMPAIGN AND HILLARY CLINTON AND HER\nPHYSICIAN FOR EXAMPLE WHAT DO THEY NEED TO DO?\n>> WELL THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN NEEDS TO RELEASE ANY AND ALL\nINFORMATION ABOUT HER HEALTH. WE REALLY HAVEN'T GOTTEN VERY\nMUCH, ESSENTIALLY A LETTER FROM HER DOCTOR ALTHOUGH TO BE FAIR,\nWOLF, IT CONTAINED MORE INFORMATION THAN THAT SILLY\nRIDICULOUS LETTER FROM DONALD TRUMP'S DOCTOR DECLARING HE\nWOULD BE THE HEALTHIEST PERSON EVER TO OCCUPY THE OVAL OFFICE,\nWITH NO PROOF. YOU HAVE TO APPLY THE SAME\nSTANDARDS TO BOTH SIDES. ALSO, IF THERE'S NO RECURRENCE,\nI DON'T KNOW THAT THIS IS A MAJOR TOPIC, EXCEPT ON SOCIAL\nMEDIA, AND YOU WILL NEVER CONTROL THE CONSPIRACY\nTHEORISTS. THEY'VE BEEN SPREADING THIS FOR\nMONTHS. >> BUT WITH THE INCIDENT TODAY\nAND THE VIDEO, THE VIDEO THAT WE SAW SHE STUMBLED GETTING INTO\nTHE CAR AS JOSH SAYS, LARRY, IT WILL BE MORE MAINSTREAMED NOW.\nPEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE ANXIOUS TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT, AND\nTHE CAMPAIGN IS GOING TO HAVE TO HELP US APPRECIATE WHAT\nHAPPENED. >> WELL, I AGREE WITH THAT.\nTHEY NEED TO RELEASE, AS I SAID, ALL INFORMATION THAT THEY HAVE.\nI THINK HER DOCTOR NEEDS TO ISSUE A STATEMENT ABOUT IT.\nYOU KNOW, SOMETIMES PEOPLE ACTUALLY DO FAINT WHEN IT'S\nREALLY HOT AND I'VE DONE IT MYSELF.\nPEOPLE PERFECTLY HEALTHY CAN FAINT IN THIS BAY.\nI'M NOT SAYING THERE'S NOTHING ELSE THERE, I DON'T KNOW, BUT I\nTHINK TOO MUCH IS BEING MADE OF IT UNTIL WE HAVE MORE FACTS.\n>> AND JOSH, HOPEFULLY WE'RE GOING TO GET MORE FACTS FROM THE\nCAMPAIGN, HOPEFULLY HILLARY CLINTON WILL ANSWER REPORTERS'\nQUESTIONS AND HOPEFULLY ISSUE A STATEMENT OR ANSWER SOME\nQUESTIONS AS WELL, BUT SO FAR IT'S ALL UP IN THE AIR AND A LOT\nOF US ARE WONDERING WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.\nFUND-RAISING CAMPAIGN TRIPS ON THE WEST COAST, AS OF NOW SHE'S\nSTILL GOING TO GO, ALTHOUGH YOU HEARD DR. SANJAY GUPTA SAY MAYBE\nOUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION SHE SHOULD GET AN EKG, A FULL\nTEST TO MAKE SURE THERE IS NOTHING THERE.\n>> RIGHT, THE EARLY INDICATIONS ARE NOT THAT THE CAMPAIGN IS\nGOING TO BE OPEN AND TRANSPARENT WITH THE PRESS.\nTHE WAY THEY'VE HANDLED THIS TODAY HAS BEEN FLAWED A LOT OF\nPEOPLE ON CNN NOTED THAT THE ACCESS AND THE INFORMATION HAS\nNOT BEEN FORTHCOMING. I'M SURE THEY'RE TRYING TO\nFIGURE IT OUT NOW. I THINK EVERYONE WOULD AGREE\nTHAT HILLARY CLINTON SHOULD DO WHATEVER SHE NEEDS TO DO TO MAKE\nSURE THAT SHE'S HEALTHY AND CONTINUE THIS RIGOROUS GRUELING\nSCHEDULE. MAYBE SHE GO AHEAD AND DO THAT.\nTHEISH ISSUE IS SHE GOING TO BE HONEST AND OPEN AND TRANSPARENT\nWITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHAT'S GOING ON AND HOW MUCH THEY KNOW\nAND DON'T KNOW. >> WHAT DO YOU ANTICIPATE LARRY\nTHE REACTION FROM THE DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN WILL BE?\nSO FAR THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY REAL REACTION PROBABLY BECAUSE\nTHIS IS THE MEMORIAL OF 9/11, 15th ANNIVERSARY OF 9/11 ON THIS\nDAY, MAYBE THEY'RE WAITING? >> WOLF, DOES ANYONE DOUBT THAT\nDONALD TRUMP WILL REFER TO THIS IN A DEROGATORY WAY SOONER OR\nLATER IN A RALLY OR SOME OTHER CAMPAIGN GATHERING?\nOF COURSE HE WILL. THAT'S I'M SURE TO BE EXPECTED\nAND THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN KNOWS TO EXPECT IT AND THAT'S WHY THEY\nSHOULD GET OUT AS MUCH INFORMATION AS THEY CAN, AS\nQUICKLY AS THEY CAN, AND TRY TO PUT IT TO REST.\nIT WILL BE PUT TO REST, AS LONG AS THERE ISN'T A RECURRENCE.\n>> THEY SHOULD PUT, I ASSUME YOU WANT NOT ONLY THE HILLARY\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN TO RELEASE ALL OF HER MEDICAL INFORMATION AND\nDONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN TO RELEASE HIS MEDICAL INFORMATION AS WELL.\nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE ELECTING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES AND DESERVE TO KNOW THE HEALTH OF THESE TWO CANDIDATES.\n>> THAT'S ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE HAD SOME\nCASES IN AMERICAN HISTORY WHERE THE PUBLIC HAS NOT RECEIVED THE\nINFORMATION IT DESERVED TO HEAR BEFORE ELECTION DAY ABOUT THE\nPRESIDENT'S HEALTH OR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE'S HEALTH.\nWE DON'T WANT A RECURRENCE OF THAT BUT I'M GLAD YOU MENTIONED\nDONALD TRUMP. THIS HAS TO BE FAIR.\nNEITHER CAMPAIGN HAS RELEASED FULL HEALTH RECORDS.\nTHEY BOTH NEED TO DO SO. >> HILLARY'S CAMPAIGN, HILLARY\nCLINTON'S CAMPAIGN HAS RELEASED MORE INFORMATION ABOUT HER\nHEALTH THAN DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN RELEASED ABOUT HIS\nHEALTH. JOSH, YOU AGREE, RIGHT?\n>> YES, THEY HAVE RELEASED MORE. THEY HAVE MORE TRANSPARENT THAN\nDONALD TRUMP BUT THEY ALSO NOW HAVE A VIRAL VIDEO OF HER\nSTUMBLING AS SHE TRIED TO GET INTO THE CAR.\nSO THESE TWO THINGS ARE BOTH TRUE AND THESE THINGS ARE NOT\nGOING AWAY. OKAY, SO IT'S MORE OF AN ISSUE\nFOR HER. THAT'S NOT FAIR OR RIGHT.\nTHAT'S POLITICS AND PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS AND WHAT I'M SAYING\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS TO GET OUT IN FRONT OF.\nHOW THIS PLAYS OUT OVER THE NEXT 58 DAYS IS NOT YET DETERMINED.\nIT COULD GO EITHER WAY DEPENDING HOW THE CLINTON TEAM HANDLES IT\nAND HOW HEALTHY SHE IS. ONE OF THE THINGS THEY HAVE\nCONTROL OVER, ONE OF THE THINGS THEY DON'T.\n>> JOSH AND LARRY, GUYS, THANKS VERY MUCH.\nWE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE OUR COVERAGE RIGHT AFTER A QUICK\nBREAK.",

LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS WITH\nREBECCA BERG, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST AND RYAN LIZ ZHA, CNN\nPOLITICAL COMMENTATOR. REBECCA, YOU OBVIOUSLY ARE\nANTICIPATING, ALL OF US ANTICIPATING LOTS OF QUESTIONS\nRAISED ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH, FAIR OR NOT.\nTHE ISSUE IS CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO GO AWAY.\nHOW SHOULD HER CAMPAIGN HANDLE THIS?\n>> WELL, I THINK, WOLF, THE BEST WAY FOR HER CAMPAIGN TO HANDLE\nTHIS WOULD BE IN THE WAY THEY HAVEN'T HANDLED QUESTIONS LIKE\nTHIS SO FAR, AND THAT'S WITH THE UTMOST TRANSPARENCY.\nHILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP, I SHOULD NOTE, HAVE NOT\nRELEASED THEIR FULL HEALTH RECORDS WHICH HAS BEEN AN\nONGOING QUESTION IN THIS CAMPAIGN, AND REALLY, THROUGHOUT\nTHE DAY, THEY HAVE NOT BEEN GIVING THE PRESS ANY SORT OF\nCONSTANT UPDATES. IT TOOK THEM I THINK 90 MINUTES\nBETWEEN HILLARY CLINTON LEAVING THE 9/11 MEMORIAL, AND BEFORE\nTHEY WERE ABLE TO GIVE THE PRESS ANY SORT OF INDICATION AS TO HER\nWHEREABOUTS OR WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND EVEN NOW WE DON'T KNOW IF\nSHE HAS MET WITH A DOCTOR, WHAT SORT OF TEST SHE'S GOING\nTHROUGH, IF ANY, WHAT SHE'S DOING AT HER HOME IN CHAPPAQUA\n. AT THIS STAGE BE TRANSPARENT AND\nTELL PEOPLE WHAT'S GOING ON. THE QUESTION WILL BE ON VOTERS'\nMINDS AND TOPIC OF CONVERSATION. >> THE HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN\nRELEASED MORE DETAILS ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH AND THE\nDONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN RELEASED ABOUT HIS HEALTH.\nTHEY'RE BOTH APPROXIMATELY THE SAME AGE, SHE'S WHAT, 69 YEARS\nOLD. HE'S 70 YEARS OLD.\nRYAN, THIS IS GOING TO FUEL THE CONSPIRACY THEORIES OUT THERE\nOVER THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS THAT SHE'S NOT IN GOOD HEALTH.\n>> YES, AND YOU KNOW, I AGREE WITH JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING\nREBECCA JUST SAID. MOST OF THE CONSPIRACY, THESE\nCONSPIRACY THEORIES ARE JUST THAT, THEY'RE CONSPIRACY\nTHEORIES, THERE'S ONE FLOATING AROUND BASED ON A VIDEO OF\nCLINTON JOKING AROUND AND SO NOTHING THAT ANYONE SHOULD HAVE\nTAKEN SERIOUSLY, BUT NOW SHE'S PUBLICLY HAD A BIT OF AN ISSUE\nHERE, AND TRANSPARENCY IS THE KEY HERE.\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN DIDN'T DO SO WELL TODAY, FRANKLY.\nTHEY DIDN'T ALLOW THE TRAVELING PRESS POOL TO LEAVE WITH HER.\nTHERE WAS RADIO SILENCE FROM THE CAMPAIGN WHEN SHE LEFT THE 9/11\nMEMORIAL THIS MORNING, AND FRANKLY, THE PRESS DIDN'T KNOW\nSHE WAS GONE, AND SO LOOK, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO BE SOMEWHAT\nUNDERSTANDING IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS, IT'S HARD TO GET\nINFORMATION TO THE PRESS, BUT THIS IS NOW GOING TO BE A PRETTY\nSIGNIFICANT ISSUE, AND GOING FORWARD, WHAT THEY NEED TO DO IS\nEXPLAIN EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED, WHAT HER PHYSICIANS BELIEVE\nHAPPENED HERE, AND MAKE SURE THAT THE PUBLIC KNOWS THAT\nTHERE'S NOTHING MORE SERIOUS, BECAUSE I CAN GUARANTEE YOU,\nTHAT DONALD TRUMP AND HIS SURROGATES WILL MAKE AN ISSUE OF\nTHIS. THEY MADE AN ISSUE OF HER HEALTH\nWHEN THERE WAS NO REASON FOR CONCERN, NOW THAT THERE IS\nSOMETHING PUBLICLY CONCERNING, IT WILL BE A TOP ISSUE AND\nTRANSPARENCY IS THE KEY FOR THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IF THEY WANT\nTO, AND THEY NEED TO MAKE SURE THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS WHAT\nHAPPENED. >> WELL, I'VE SPOKEN TO SOME\nPEOPLE, REBECCA, WHO SAY THE BEST THING FOR HER TO DO IS DO A\nLITTLE NEWS CONFERENCE, EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED IN HER OWN WORDS\nBUT ALSO AT THE SAME TIME INVITE HER PHYSICIAN TO JOIN THE\nCONVERSATION AND ANSWER REPORTERS QUESTIONS AND GIVE A\nPRECISE ACCOUNTING OF WHAT HAPPENED, WHICH MAY BE NOT THAT\nKIG SIGG CANT, COULD BE SIGNIFICANT.\nMAYBE THAT WOULD BE THE BEST WAY TO SHOW PRESUMABLY SHE'S OKAY.\n>> SURE, I THINK THAT WOULD BE A GREAT IDEA, WOLF.\nI THINK SHE AND HER CAMPAIGN COULD CERTAINLY POINT OUT THAT\nCANDIDATES FOR PRESIDENT, VICE PRESIDENT HAVE DEALT WITH HEALTH\nISSUES BEFORE. I MEAN, USUALLY THE NORM IS NOT\nFOR SOMEONE IN THEIR 30s OR 40s TO BE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.\nTHE NORM IS FOR PEOPLE MUCH OLDER THAN THAT TO BE RUNNING SO\nYOU'RE GOING TO HAVE HAD HEALTH ISSUES OVER THE COURSE OF YOUR\nLIFETIME. DICK CHENEY DECIDED IN 1996 NOT TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT\nBECAUSE HE WAS WORRIED HIS PAST HEART ATTACKS WOULD BE A\nCAMPAIGN ISSUE. HE RAN IN 2000 WITH VERY FEW\nQUESTIONS ASKED ABOUT HIS HEART HEALTH, DURING THE FLORIDA\nRECOUNT HE HAD A FOURTH HEART ATTACK OF HIS LIFETIME, BUT\nSTILL DOING FINE TODAY. AND SO SHE COULD VERY WELL POINT\nOUT THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN IN THIS POSITION BEFORE, HAVE BEEN\nABLE TO FULFILL THEIR OFFICES. GEORGE W. BUSH FAINTED WHEN HE\nWAS PRESIDENTED, AND THAT WAS AN ISSUE FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF\nTIME, AND HE CAME FORWARD AND JUST EXPLAINED WHAT HAD\nHAPPENED. HE SAID AND THIS IS A GREAT\nGEORGE W. BUSH CLASSIC QUOTE \"I HIT THE DECKS.\"\nHE TOLD PEOPLE WHAT HAPPENED AND PEOPLE MOVED ON SO I THINK THAT\nWOULD BE THE VERY WISE COURSE OF ACTION FOR HILLARY CLINTON IN\nTHIS CASE AS WELL. >> AND RYAN, YOU HEARD OUR CHIEF\nMEDICAL CORRESPONDENT DR. SANJAY GUPTA, WHO IS A NEUROSURGEON, AN\nEXPERT IN THESE KINDS OF AREAS, HE DID SAY PRECISELY THAT, YOU\nKNOW WHAT? MAYBE OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF\nCAUTION, SHE SHOULD HAVE A COMPLETE CHECKUP RIGHT NOW TO\nMAKE SURE FOR EXAMPLE IT'S NOT AT ALL CONNECTED TO WHAT\nHAPPENED AT THE END OF 2012, WHICH SHE FAINTED, HIT HER HEAD,\nHAD A CONCUSSION AND AS A RESULT SHE HAD A BLOOD CLOT BETWEEN HER\nBRAIN AND HER SKULL AND SHE'S BEEN TAKING SOME BLOOD THINNERS\nEVER SINCE. I THINK OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF\nCAUTION YOU'RE SAYING MAYBE SHE SHOULD DELAY HER TRIP TO\nCALIFORNIA TOMORROW AND HAVE A COMPLETE CHECKUP.\n>> YES, OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT\nFOR US AS POLITICAL COMMENTATORS NO THE TO PLAY DOCTOR AND THINK\nWE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED HERE.\nI NOTICED THAT SANJAY WAS VERY CAREFUL IN NOT DOING SOME\nDIAGNOSIS FROM AFAR. THIS COULD BE NOTHING OR\nSOMETHING SERIOUS. WE DON'T KNOW FROM A GRAINY\nVIDEO AT A DISTANCE. AS REBECCA POINTED OUT GEORGE\nH.W. BUSH FAINTED WHEN HE WAS IN PUBLIC IN JAPAN IN THE LATE\n'80s, EARLY '90s AND GEORGE W. BUSH CHOKED ON A PRETZEL IN THE\nWHITE HOUSE, PASSED OUT AND GOT A BUMP ON HIS HEAD, BOTH\nINCIDENTS CAUSED GREAT PUBLIC CONCERN AND TURNED OUT TO BE\nNOTHING IN THE END SO AGAIN, IT GOES BACK TO THIS ISSUE OF\nTRANSPARENCY, YOU KNOW, RIGHT NOW WE HAVE SCANT DETAILS, WE'RE\nSPECULATING ABOUT HER INCIDENT IN 2012, WHEN SHE HAD A\nCONCUSSION AND BLOOD CLOT. HER HUSBAND, AFTER THAT\nHAPPENED, HE PUBLICLY SAID, BILL CLINTON PUBLICLY SAID IT TOOK\nABOUT SIX MONTHS OF SERIOUS WORK TO GET OVER THAT CONCUSSION.\nIT WAS NO SMALL THING, SO WE WOULD OBVIOUSLY WANT TO KNOW IF\nIT'S ANYTHING RELATED, IF THIS IS RELATED TO THAT OR AS SOME\nREPORTS ARE SUGGESTING, IF IT'S RELATED TO HER ALLERGIES.\nSHE HAS HAD SOME ISSUES WITH ALLERGIES ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL\nRECENTLY. WE DON'T KNOW.\nTHAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT THEY NEED TO COME OUT VERY\nCLEARLY WITH MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS AND JUST EXPLAIN\nEXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED HERE. THAT'S THE BEST WAY FOR THEM TO\nGO FORWARD AND FOR US TO UNDERSTAND IT, BECAUSE THE WORST\nTHING IN THE WORLD WOULD BE FOR ISSUES LIKE THIS TO BE HANGING\nOVER THE CAMPAIGN AND IF SHE ENTERS THE WHITE HOUSE AND WE\nDON'T KNOW. WE DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO THE\nBAD OLD DAYS, WHERE WE HAD PRESIDENTS WHO ENTERED THE WHITE\nHOUSE WITH MEDICAL CONDITIONS THE PUBLIC DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT.\n>> GOOD ADVICE, RYAN LI AZZA THANKS, AND REBECCA BERG, STAY\nWITH US AS WELL. REMEMBER THE THICK GLASSES THAT\nHILLARY CLINTON WORE DURING THOSE SIX MONTHS OR SO WHEN SHE\nWAS RECUPERATING FROM THE BLOOD CLOT.\nWE'LL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE BREAKING NEWS ON HILLARY\nCLINTON, WHAT THIS POTENTIAL COULD MEAN FOR HER CAMPAIGN.\nMUCH MORE OF THE NEWS. STAY WITH US.\nWE'LL TAKE A QUICK BREAK.",

LET'S WATCH THIS VID CROW FOR A\nSECOND. YOU SEE HER APPARENTLY ALMOST\nFALLING BUT CAUGHT BY PEOPLE PRESUMABLY SECRET SERVICE AGENTS\nAROUND HER. A LITTLE WHILE AGO WE SAW HER\nLEAVE THE APARTMENT BUILDING AND WAVE TO REPORTERS, LOOKING\nBETTER THAN IN THE VID CROW WE'RE SHOWING NOW.\nSHE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH TO SAY JUST NOW BUT YOU CAN LISTEN TO HOW\nSHE RESPONDED TO REPORTERS SHOUTED QUESTIONS.\n>> HOW ARE YOU FEELING HILLARY CLINTON?\nARE YOU FEELING BETTER? >> YES, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nTHANK YOU, EVERYBODY. >> CNN REPORTER MJ LEE IS\nOUTSIDE CHELSEA CLINTON'S APARTMENT WHERE HILLARY CLINTON\nWENT TO E RECUPERATE. SHE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH TO SAY WHEN\nE SHE LEFT REPORTERS.

THE ONLY THING THE CAMPAIGN TOLD\nUS IS SHE WAS FEELING OVERHEATED AND THAT'S WHY SHE CAME TO HER\nDAUGHTER'S HOME HERE CUTTING THE KCOMMEMORATION A LITTLE BIT\nEARLY. NOW KEEP IN MIND THAT THE\nCAMPAIGN VERY MUCH WANTED TODAY TO BE FREE OF POLITICS, BUT FOR\nSURE WE KNOW THAT THE ISSUES ABOUT HER HEALTH AND WHAT\nHAPPENED THIS MORNING ARE CERTAIN TO FUEL QUESTIONS ABOUT\nHILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH, TRUMP ALLIES AND CRITICS HAVE\nCONTINUED TO BRING UP QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER SHE IS IN A GOOD\nSTATE OF HEALTH TO ASSUME THE WHITE HOUSE IN THE OFFICE OF THE\nWHITE HOUSE. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT COULD BE\nRENEWED BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED THIS MORNING.\nTHE OTHER QUESTION IS ALSO WHETHER THIS ENDS UP AFFECTING\nHER TRAVEL. TOMORROW SHE IS SET TO HEAD WEST\nTO DO A WEST COAST SWING GOING TO SAN FRANCISCO, LOS ANGELES,\nSO WE'LL BE IN TOUCH WITH THE CAMPAIGN TO SEE WHETHER THIS\nENDS UP AFFECTING HER CAMPAIGN SCHEDULE THIS IT WEEK.\n>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.

LET ME START WITH YOU AND\nQUESTIONS ABOUT A CANDIDATE'S HEALTH.\nWE CAN TALK ABOUT RONALD REAGAN, BOB DOLE, JOHN McCAIN, NOW WE'RE\nTALKING ABOUT A DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE.\nLET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THAT VIDEO WE JUST GOT IN A SECOND AGO OF\nHILLARY CLINTON GETTING INTO HER VEHICLE AND SEEMING TO HAVE SOME\nTROUBLE STANDING AS SHE GETS INTO THE VEHICLE.\nSO IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY HAVING TROUBLE STANDING AND COULD BE\nEXPLAINED AWAY, BUT ALSO SHE DID HAVE THAT SERIOUS EPISODE WHEN\nSHE HAD THE BLOOD CLOT IN IT HER BRAIN IN 2012.\n>> WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS EARLIER WHEN WE WERE WATCHING\nTHIS. SHE'S HAD TWO INCIDENTS.\nONE SHE COUGHED AND THE OTHER SHE OVERHEATED.\nTHAT'S THE SERIES OF INCIDENTS SHE'S HAD THAT HAVE BEEN MEDICAL\nNEEDS. SHE'S ACTUALLY PROVIDED MORE\nINFORMATION THAN DONALD TRUMP HAS.\nDOES SHE NEED TO PROVIDE MORE? THAT'S A LEGITIMATE QUESTION TO\nASK. THE ONLY TIME THE REPUBLICAN\nPARTY SEEMS TO CARE ABOUT WOMEN'S HEALTH IS HILLARY'S\nHEALTH. WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT REAL\nISSUES AFFECTING THIS CAMPAIGN. TODAY IS NOT A DAY FOR HOL\nPICKS. SHE GOT OVERHEATED AND WE NEED\nTO MOVE ON AND TALK ABOUT THE ISSUESOVER THE DAY.\n>> I DO AGREE WITH THAT. I'M A NURSE.\nI U DON'T WANT TO SPECULATE WHAT WENT ON WITH HILLARY CLINTON.\nWE DON'T KNOW. THAT'S UP TO THE PHYSICIANS TO\nDETERMINE. BUT WHAT I WILL SAY IS I'M\nCONCERNED ABOUT HER POLICIES ON HEALTH CARE.\nI LOOK AT MY STATE OF TENNESSEE AND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS\nIMPLODING THERE. 63% WILL BE THE RISE IN\nPREMIUMS. WE LOST OUR CO-OP.\nI'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT SHE'S SAYING ABOUT HEALTH CARE.\nTRUE HEALTH CARE FOR OUR NATION AND MY STATE.\nI THINK IT WILL BE UP TO THE DOCTORS TO MAKE THAT DECISION.\nI U THINK IT'S PROBABLY LEGITIMATE TO ASK WHAT IS HER\nHEALTH. SHE HAS TO BE HONEST WITH THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE WHETHER SHE'S HEALTHY ENOUGH TO SERVE THE\nCOUNTRY. >> IT IS JUST AN ACCURATE FACT\nYULE MATTER WHATEVER YOU THINK OF HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH,\nDONALD TRUMP HAS DISCLOSED LESS INFORMATION.\nHE'S 70 YEARS OLD. HILLARY CLINTON IS 68.\nWOULD IT BE A GOOD IDEA FOR BOTH CANDIDATES O IT GET ALL THE\nHEALTH INFORMATION AS IS NORMALLY DONE AS BARACK OBAMA,\nMITT ROMNEY, JOHN McCAIN DID? >> IT WOULD BE.\nI THINK THE VOTERS WOULD LIKE TO KNOW.\nIT WOULD BE -- THE FACT THAT WE HAVE TWO CANDIDATES THAT WOULD\nBE THE OLDER CANDIDATES TO SERVE IN THE PRESIDENCY MAKES THE\nQUESTION MORE ONE THAT PEOPLE WOULD BE INTERESTED IN.\nJOHN McCAIN TURNED OVER A GREAT DOLE MORE OF HIS HEALTH RECORDS\nAS WELL. >> HE DID ABSOLUTELY.\nHE HAD SOME CANCER SCARES AS WELL.\nYOU THINK THE MEDIA IS MAKING T BIG OF A DEAL?\n>> IF IT'S DONALD TRUMP, WE WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT IT.\nBUT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HER HAVING HEALTH\nISSUE,S IT'S A COUGHING FIT. I HAVE HAD THIS BEFORE.\nTHIS COULD BE DEHYDRATION OR OVERTIRED OR IN THE HEAT.\nSO I DON'T THINK THAT NECESSARILY MEANS THAT SHE HAS\nSOME SERIOUS HEALTH ISSUES. I MEAN, I REMEMBER THE FIRST\nGEORGE BUSH PASSING OUT IN JAPAN AND HE'S BEEN VERY HEALTHY AND\nLIVED A LONG TIME AND HAS HAD NO OTHER REAL HEALTH ISSUES.\nI DON'T THINK WE CAN TAKE AWAY FROM THIS SHE HAS SERIOUS HEALTH\nISSUES. >> I'M NOT TRYING TO DIMINISH\nWHAT HAPPENED TODAY, BUT I RECALL GEORGE BUSH HIM CHOKING\nON A PRETZEL AND E EMERGING WITH A BRUISE ON HIS FACE AND THERE\nWERE A TON OF CONSPIRACY THEORIES ABOUT THAT.\n>> I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY WHAT IS REMARKABLE IN THIS IS THAT\nBOTH OF THESE CANDIDATES, THE SCHEDULE THEY KEEP IS GRUELING.\nALL OF US HAVE BEEN ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND THEY RUN YOU\nAS HARD AS THEY CAN. THE FACT THAT BOTH OF THEM ARE\nTHE AGE THEY ARE, THEY KEEP THE GROWLING SCHEDULE AND THE\nPRESSURE AND STRESS THEY ARE UNDER, I'M AMAZED WHEN I WATCH\nDONALD TRUMP AS LATE AS HE IS AND EARLY AS HE IS IN THE\nMORNING, BOTH OF THEM I HAVE BEEN AMAZED AT THEIR STAMINA.\n>> YOU'RE A NURSE. MY MOM IS A NURSE TOO.\nI KNOW HOW HARD A JOB IT IS. I APPRECIATE YOU'RE NOT WANTING\nTO SPECULATE. DO YOU AGREE BOTH TRUMP AND\nCLINTON SHOULD GET ALL THESE HEALTH RECORDS OUT THERE SO THE\nVOTERS CAN MAKE UP THEIR MINDS? >> I DO AGREE.\nI THINK IT IS SOMETHING WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW AS WE HAVE SOMEONE\nTHAT'S GOING TO SERVE OUR COUNTRY.\nIN REALLY DIFFICULT SITUATIONS AS ANDRE ALREADY SAID, THERE'S A\nLOT OF THE PHYSICAL NATURE OF THESE JOBS THAT PEOPLE DON'T\nREALIZE EARLY IN THE MORNING UNTIL LATE AT NIGHT, YOU'RE\nGOING ALL DAY. MANY TIMES YOU DON'T GET A\nCHANCE TO EAT AT NORMAL TIMES OR IN NORMAL FOOD.\nI DO THINK WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WHO\nWHOEVER IS GOING TO BE OUR COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF IS HEALTHY.\n>> THEY AGE 20 YEARS. COMING UP, THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN ON\nOFFENSE AS CLINTON TRIES TO DEFEND COMMENTS CALLING HALF OF\nHIS SUPPORTERS A BASKET OF DEP\nDEPL DEPLORABLE.\nTHAT'S NEXT.",

WE ARE SEEING THE CEASE-FIRE\nDEAL AND THEY ARE DOING SO FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS.\nTHEY FEEL THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH MECHANISMS TO ENFORCE AND\nMONITOR VIOLATIONS. THEY ALSO FEEL AS IF THIS DEAL\nWOULD PUT THEM AT A DISADVANTAGE BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY CONCERNED\nABOUT A NUMBER OF ISSUES. FIRST AND FOREMOST, THE FACT\nTHERE IS A VAGUE WARNING WITHIN THE CEASE-FIRE DEAL WITHIN REBEL\nGROUPS TO DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM THE GROUP KNOWN AS AL-NUSRA\nFRONT. A LOT OF THESE AREAS, FRONTLINES\nARE BLURRED. THEY ALSO WANT TO SEE THE SHI'A\nMILITIAS FIGHTING ALONGSIDE THE REGIME PUT ON THE LIST OF\nTERRORIST ENTITIES. THEY HAVE NOT COME OUT AND\nREJECTED IT YET, BUT THEY ARE RELUCTANT ABOUT THE TERMS.\nTHEY ARE RELUCTANT TO BE ON BOARD.\nAT THIS POINT IN TIME, THEY ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.\n>> THANKS SO MUCH FOR THAT.

THE YOUNGER GENERATION TENDS TO\nLOSE INTEREST BETWEEN 3 TO 30 SECONDS WHEN WATCHING A\nCOMMERCIAL. >> WOW.\n>> THE FIRST THREE SECONDS ARE RETAINING.\nAFTER THREE THEY START TO LOSE IT.\nTHAT'S KEY. MAKING THINGS SHAREABLE.\nTHE YOUNGER GENERATIONS ARE LOOKING TO SOCIAL MEDIA.\nOVER 90% OF THEM ARE ON ONE SOCIAL NETWORK.\n70% ARE ON TWO OR MORE. SO YOU HAVE TO MAKE THINGS\nSHAREABLE. THEN YOU HAVE TO TAKE ON NEW\nIDEAS, WHETHER THAT IS SUSTAINABILITY.\n80% OF THE YOUNGER GENERATIONS BELIEVE THAT SUCCESS GOES BEYOND\nTHE FINANCIALS. THROUGH TO THINGS LIKE THE\nSHARING ECONOMY, THEY THINK AND ACT DIFFERENTLY THAN PREVIOUS\nGENERATIONS. >> HOW DO YOU DO YOUR RESEARCH?\nTALKING ABOUT THESE MILLENIALS AND CENTENNIALS, DO YOU TALK TO\nPEOPLE ON A DAILY BASIS? DO YOU HAVE RESEARCH TEAM THAT\nIS GO OUT AND DO THAT? HOW DO YOU DO IT?\nOTHERWISE YOU DON'T GET INTO WHAT IS GOING ON IN THEIR HEADS?\n>> WE DO. INTEND A LOT OF TIME MEETING\nEXPERTS AND WORKING WITH YOUNGER CLIENTS.\nI'M A GENERAL X'er, A LOT OF THE YOUNG CLIENTS ARE MILLENIALS AND\nWILL BE A PART OF THE DPLOBL WORKFORCE.\nWE HAVE A TEAM OF 750 ANALYSTS AROUND THE WORLD GRAPPLING WITH\nTHE ISSUES. 90% OF CORPORATES DON'T\nUNDERSTAND THE MILLENIALS AND THE CENTENNIALS.\nHOW THE BUSINESS MODELS NEED TO CHANGE.\nTHAT'S WHAT OUR ANALYSTS ARE INCREASINGLY TACKLING.\n>> I WANT TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE MILLENIAL VIEW OF AUTOS\nBECAUSE THERE WAS A FRONT PAGE ON THE ECONOMIST RECENTLY\nTALKING ABOUT THE UBER WORLD AND HOW WE ARE POTENTIALLY MOVING\nCLOSER TO GETTING AWAY FROM CAR OPENER SHIP AMONG THIS\nGENERATION OR PHASING TO IT OF IT.\nIS THAT SOMETHING YOU SEE IN THE STUDIES?\n>> DEFINITELY THEY ARE NOT HEARING THE CALL OF THE OPEN\nROAD THAT THE PREVIOUS GENERATIONS ARE.\nFIRST IN TERMS OF THE ISSUES THEY BELIEVE STRONGLY ABOUT,\nCLIMATE CHANGE IS THE NUMBER ONE IN THE WORLD TODAY.\nVEHICLE MILES TRAVELED DOWN BY 23% IN THE U.S. OVER THE LAST 14\nYEARS. THE PERCENTAGE OF 19-YEAR-OLDS\nWITH A LICENSE HAS FALLEN FROM 64% TO 46% OVER THE SAME PERIOD.\nA SMARTPHONE RATHER THAN A DRIVER'S LICENSE IS BECOMING THE\nMOST IMPORTANT THING FOR A CHILD TODAY.\nAND THEN ON THE FLIP SIDE, WE'RE SEEING A RISE IN THE USE OF\nPUBLIC TRANSPORTS, THE USE OF THE SHARING ECONOMY, 70% OF UBER\nUSERS ARE MILLENIALS. AND THEN ULTIMATELY TOWARDS NEW\nBUSINESS MODELS SUCH AS CARPOOLING OR A SELF-DRIVING\nCAR. >> SARJ, HOW DO YOU MAKE MONEY?\nDO YOU BUY EQUITIES LIKE GOOGLE OR FACEBOOK?\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO OWN? >> IN TERMS OF THIS, WE SET OUT\nFIVE POINTS, TECH IS KEY. SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS ARE THE\nSMARTPHONE MANUFACTURERS, THE SEARCH ENGINES, THE SOCIAL MEDIA\nCOMPANIES, IT'S THE MUSIC COMPANIES STARTING TO MONOTIZE\nTHE STREAMING. IT'S THE VIDEO GAME COMPANIES.\n10% TO 17% OF THE LEISURE TIME OF YOUNG PEOPLE IS SPENT ON\nVIDEO GAMES. BUT YOU ALSO HAVE HUGE\nOPPORTUNITIES IN THE CONSUMER SPACE IN TERMS OF HOUSEHOLD\nINFORMATION. IN TERMS OF EDUCATION AND ALSO\nIN TERMS OF FINANCIALS, I WOULD STRESS THERE IS ALSO A RISK\nFACTOR OF THE YOUNGER INVESTORS THAT ARE CONSERVATIVE.\nTHEY ARE LESS STICKY. AND THEY DON'T LOOK TO THE\nEQUITY MARKETS THE SAME SORT OF WAY THAT PREVIOUS GENERATIONS\nDO. >> THAT'S TRUE.\nTHEY TEND TO BE VERY FICKLE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT, SARJ\nNEHAL AT BANK OF AMERICA MERRILL LYNCH.\nHOW MANY TIMES DO YOU CHECK YOUR PHONE A DAY, IS IT 150 TIMES?\n>> I HOPE NOT. BUT I DO IT WITHOUT THINKING.\nWE NEED TO GO INTO THE PHONE",

GUY, I WANT TO START WITH YOU.\nBASKET OF DEPLORABLES, 50% OF DONALD TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS, WOULD\nYOU HAVE USED THAT LANGUAGE? >> WELL, AS YOU ALREADY POINTED\nOUT, HILLARY SAID SHE REGRETTED SAYING IT WAS HALF BUT IT\nDOESN'T TAKE AWAY FROM THE FACT TRUMP HAS SPENT MONTHS, OVER A\nYEAR NOW, USING CODED RACIST AND BIGOTED LANGUAGE AND IN FACT,\nJUST THIS WEEKEND, HIS TOP POLITICAL ADVISER AND HIS OWN\nSON WERE TREATING OUT WHITE NATIONALIST IMAGES THAT INCLUDED\nTHE MASCOT OF THE ALT-RIGHT AND AN IMAGE OF A GUY WHO TRAFFICS\nIN CONSPIRACY THEORIES ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS REALLY\nA MURDER AT SANDY HOOK. I DO THINK THAT POINTING OUT HIS\nRACISM, POINTING OUT BIGOTRY, DOES NOT MAKE YOU RACIST OR\nBIGOTED. IT MAKES YOU A TRUTH TELLER.\nI THINK WHAT HILLARY SAID IS RIGHT AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE\nRIGHT THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THIS ELECTION AS IT HAS BEEN\nSINCE THE DAY DONALD TRUMP GOT INTO THE RACE.\n>> IF WHAT SHE SAID IS RIGHT, WHY DOES SHE REGRET IT?\nLAST NIGHT I WAS GROSSLY GENERALISTIC AND THAT'S NEVER A\nGOOD IDEA. I REGRET SAYING HALF.\nTHAT WAS WRONG. IF YOU THINK SHE'S RIGHT AND SHE\nSAYS SHE WAS WRONG ON THE PERCENTAGE, WHAT PERCENTAGE IS\nCORRECT? >> WELL, I THINK IF YOU\nCONTINUED READING THE STATEMENT THAT SHE PUT OUT, SHE WOULD HAVE\nCONTINUED BY SAYING SHE DOESN'T BACK AWAY FROM CONTINUALLY\nPOINTING OUT DONALD TRUMP'S BEHAVIOR.\nTHIS IS A MAN THAT SAID MEXICO WAS SENDING RAPISTS AND\nMURDERERS TO THE UNITED STATES, THAT QUESTIONED --\n>> BUT IS IT ABOUT DONALD TRUMP OR IT SOUNDED LIKE WHEN SHE WAS\nMAKING THOSE COMMENTS SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S\nSUPPORTERS. >> I THINK IF YOU GO TO A DONALD\nTRUMP RALLY, OFTENTIMES AS THIS NETWORK AND OTHERS HAVE POINTED\nOUT, YOU WILL CONTINUALLY HEAR PEOPLE USING THE \"N\" WORD.\nYOU WILL SEE AN ALT-RIGHT PRESS CONFERENCE LAST WEEK THAT SAID\nTHE ALT-RIGHT WAS SUPPORTING DONALD TRUMP AND YOU WILL SEE\nTHE FACT THAT THEIR CEO OF THE CAMPAIGN HAS LED A WEBSITE THAT\nTRAFFICS IN RACISM AND BIGOTRY. SO NO, NOT ALL DONALD TRUMP\nSUPPORTERS ARE RACIST, AS HILLARY CLINTON HERSELF POINTED\nOUT. BUT THAT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY FROM\nTHE FACT THAT HE HAS SPENT MONTHS TRAFFICKING IN RACISM AND\nBIGOTRY. TO PRETEND LIKE HE HASN'T FOR\nSOME REASON BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON SAID HALF REALLY DEFIES\nCOMMON SENSE AND LOGIC IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE.\n>> LET ME TAKE THAT TO JOHN, BECAUSE GUY JUST BROUGHT UP THE\nTWEET THIS WEEKEND WHICH DID USE ALT-RIGHT SYMBOLISM.\nTHAT WAS RETWEETED BY THE KIDS. DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF DID AN\nINTERVIEW A FEW MINUTES AGO ON CNBC WHERE HE CALLED ELIZABETH\nWARREN POCAHONTAS ONCE AGAIN. >> RACIST.\n>> RACIST OR NATIVE AMERICAN SLUR RIGHT THERE.\nSO IS DONALD TRUMP AT LEAST FLIRTING WITH THIS TYPE OF\nLANGUAGE? >> NO.\nFIRST OF ALL, CALLING ELIZABETH WARREN POCAHONTAS IS NOT RACIST.\nSHE CLAIMED SHE WAS AN AMERICAN INDIAN IN ORDER TO GET A JOB.\nTHAT WASN'T TRUE. HE'S TEASING HER ABOUT LYING\nABOUT HER HERITAGE TO GET A JOB. THAT'S WHAT THAT IS.\nCOMMENTING ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND CALLING SOMEONE\nA RACIST BECAUSE THEY ARE AGAINST ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IS\nRIDICULOUS. DONALD TRUMP IS NOT A RACIST.\nTHE COMMENT HILLARY CLINTON MADE --\n>> HE SAID A LOT OF, THE MEXICAN AMERICAN JUDGE.\nWE DON'T NEED -- >> TO QUESTION SOMEONE WHEN HE\nIS GOING -- >> WE DON'T NEED TO GO DOWN THE\nLIST OF ISSUES IN THIS CAMPAIGN, JOHN.\n>> YOU KNOW PAUL RYAN CALLED THAT THE TEXTBOOK DEFINITION OF\nRACISM. >> WHATEVER PAUL RYAN SAYS,\nTHAT'S PAUL RYAN'S OPINION AND I UNDERSTAND THAT AND ACCEPT THAT.\nBUT THE REALITY IS DONALD TRUMP IS NOT A RACIST AND NOTHING HE'S\nEVER SAID MAKES HIM A RACIST. HE MAY HAVE SAID CONTROVERSIAL\nTHINGS. HE'S CLEARLY AGAINST ILLEGAL\nIMMIGRATION. WHAT HILLARY CLINTON DID IS\nATTACK AMERICANS, NOT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.\nAMERICAN CITIZENS THAT ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE POLITICAL\nPROCESS. WHAT SHE DID WAS IRRESPONSIBLE,\nIT WAS HORRIBLE. MAYBE SHE WASN'T FEELING WELL,\nMAYBE SHE'S NOT MAKING GOOD DECISIONS, MAYBE SHE'S NOT ABLE\nTO MAKE GOOD DECISIONS RIGHT NOW BASED ON HER HEALTH.\nBUT I WILL TELL YOU WHAT SHE DID IS SHE ATTACKED AMERICANS.\nDONALD TRUMP IS ATTACKING ILLEGAL --\n>> WE WILL GET TO THAT BECAUSE IT DOES BRING UP A GOOD POINT\nTALKING ABOUT VOTERS, THE SINNERS, NOT THE SIN IN THIS\nCASE. YOU DON'T THINK DONALD TRUMP\nWITH HIS LANGUAGE OVER THE LAST 16 MONTHS HAS COURTED FRINGE\nELEMENTS THAT MAY BE CONSIDERED RACIST?\nAGAIN, I WILL USE THE PAUL RYAN TEXTBOOK DEFINITION OF RACISM.\nYOU HAVE THAT RIGHT THERE. THE DAVID DUKE THING, REFUSING\nTO CONDEMN HIM OR DISAVOW HIM RIGHT AWAY.\nTHERE'S A LOT OF EXAMPLES HERE, RETWEETING, LOT OF PEOPLE SAW\nTHINGS AS ANTISEMETIC. AFTER AWHILE THERE SEEMS TO BE A\nPATTERN HERE. >> EVEN DAVID DUKE, HE'S\nREPEATEDLY DENOUNCED DAVID DUKE. >> ONLY AFTER HE DIDN'T KNOW WHO\nDAVID DUKE WAS, HAD TO BE PUSHED BY JAKE TAPPER TO EVEN\nACKNOWLEDGE DAVID DUKE AND HIS ORGANIZATION.\nCOME ON. >> SO THE MEDIA ACCUSES HIM OF\nBEING FRIEND WITH DAVID DUKE. IT ENDS UP HE DOESN'T KNOW DAVID\nDUKE. THEN HE'S ATTRIBUTED TO BECAUSE\nDAVID DUKE SAYS SOMETHING POSITIVE ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S\nPOSITIONS. YOU KNOW WHAT, THERE ARE ALL\nFACETS OF AMERICANS FROM THE LIBERAL TO THE CONSERVATIVE END\nTHAT LIKE DONALD TRUMP'S MESSAGE IN SOME WAY, SOME PORTION OF HIS\nMESSAGE. HE'S SPEAKING THE TRUTH TO THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE. ONE OF HIS PROBLEMS EARLY ON IN\nTHIS RACE WAS THAT THE REPUBLICAN RIGHT WAS CONCERNED\nABOUT DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE HE WANT THE TEXTBOOK CANDIDATE.\nDONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO BE THE PRESIDENT FOR ALL AMERICANS.\nHE DOESN'T NECESSARILY JUST TOE THE PARTY LINE.\nHE'S TRYING TO FIX AMERICA AND WE NEED IT BADLY.\n>> GUY, RESPOND TO THIS, SPECIFICALLY THE POINT JOHN WAS\nBRINGING UP THAT THE REASON A LOT OF PEOPLE LATCHED ON TO WHAT\nHILLARY CLINTON SAID, HALF OF DONALD TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS GO\nINTO THE BASKET OF DEPLORABLES, SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT VOTERS\nTHERE. THAT'S SOMETHING YOU DON'T\nTYPICALLY HEAR FROM CANDIDATES WHEN THEY ATTACK VOTERS.\n>> WELL, I THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE TO ATTACK THE\nALT-RIGHT MOVEMENT WHO ARE VOTERS.\nI THINK IT IS OKAY TO POINT OUT THE SUPPORT OF A MAN WHO\nTRAFFICS IN SANDY HOOK CONSPIRACY THEORIES.\nHE IS A VOTER. BY THE WAY, IT'S NOT JUST PAUL\nRYAN AMONG THE REPUBLICANS THAT HAVE CALLED DONALD TRUMP A\nRACIST. A SITTING UNITED STATES\nREPUBLICAN SENATOR WITHDREW HIS ENDORSEMENT OF DONALD TRUMP\nBECAUSE HE SAID HE WAS TOO RACIST.\nBY THE WAY, EVEN IF YOU IGNORED EVERY SINGLE THING THAT DONALD\nTRUMP HAS SAID SINCE BEING A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE\nUNITED STATES, HE BEGAN HIS CAREER BY OPENLY DISCRIMINATING\nAGAINST AFRICAN-AMERICANS, PREVENTING THEM FROM LEASING\nRENTAL SPACE IN THEIR BUILDINGS. NOW, I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MEETS\nTHE OTHER PANELIST'S DEFINITION OF AMERICAN, BUT THE FACT OF THE\nMATTER IS THAT HE'S BUILT HIS CAREER AND HIS PRESIDENTIAL\nCAMPAIGN ON RACISM. BLATANT, BIGOTED RACISM AND IT'S\nOKAY TO CALL IT OUT. IN FACT, IT'S REQUIRED OF ALL OF\nUS TO CALL IT OUT WHEN WE SEE IT.\n>> SOUNDS LIKE HILLARY CLINTON REGRETS WHAT SHE SAID BUT THEY\nARE READY TO HAVE THIS FIGHT FROM HERE UNTIL ELECTION DAY.\nGUY, JOHN, THANK YOU SO MUCH.",

I REALLY DO.\nWHEN I SAW THIS IN ITS FULL FORM, AND I SAW THE ANGER WITH\nWHICH SHE SAID IT, THE WAY SHE SPOKE, I THINK IT'S THE SINGLE\nBIGGEST MISTAKE OF THE POLITICAL SEASON.\n>> SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT.

WILL INDEPENDENTS AND\nREPUBLICANS MAKE CLINTON PAY? >> WE WILL SEE ABOUT THAT.\nI THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS UNDERSCORE WHAT WAS AT THE HEART\nOF HER COMMENTS. I'M REALLY GLAD YOU PLAYED HER\nWHOLE COMMENTS BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT.\nI'M ALSO GLAD SHE WALKED BACK THE HALF.\nBUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT SHE ACTUALLY SAID IN TERMS OF SOME\nOF HIS SUPPORTERS, IT IS NOT INCORRECT AT ALL.\nSHE GAVE A WHOLE SPEECH NOT TOO LONG AGO ABOUT HOW THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN AND FOLKS WITHIN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN EVEN REPRESENT\nALL OF THE PIECES OF WHAT SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT WERE\nDEPLORABLE AND WHAT THOSE ARE, ARE THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN\nXENOPHOBIA, THOSE WHO SUPPORT AND HAVE ACTUALLY CONSTITUTED\nPART OF THE WHITE SUPREMACIST MOVEMENT, PEOPLE WHO ARE RACIST,\nPEOPLE WHO HAVE GONE TO TRUMP AND SUPPORTED HIM BECAUSE OF THE\nXENOPHOBIC, RACIST COMMENTS HE'S MADE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING\nFROM THE FIRST DAY HE ANNOUNCED HIS CAMPAIGN.\nI THINK IN THAT CONTEXT, SHE IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT AND WHAT SHE\nIS FOCUSING ON IS THAT WE AS A COUNTRY HAVE TO LIFT UP AMERICAN\nVALUES OF INCLUSIVENESS, OF MAKING SURE THAT WE TALK ABOUT\nHOW GREAT OUR DIVERSITY IS INSTEAD OF USING IT AS A WEDGE\nISSUE WHICH IS WHAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS DONE.\nI THINK IN THAT CONTEXT, MOST AMERICANS WILL AGREE WITH HER,\nESPECIALLY THOSE HUGE SWATHS OF VOTERS THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS\nINSULTED FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.\n>> I THINK, BORIS, THAT DEMOCRATS LIKE MARIA WOULD\nPROBABLY CITE THINGS LIKE THIS TO PROVE THEIR POINT.\nDONALD TRUMP JR., FOR EXAMPLE, PUT THIS IMAGE ON HIS INSTAGRAM\nACCOUNT. IT'S A MEME OF PEPE AND FOR\nTHOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW, PEPE IS A WHITE NATIONALIST\nSYMBOL. DAVID DUKE, THE FORMER KKK\nLEADER, TWEETED A SIMILAR IMAGE BUT PHOTOSHOPPED HIS FACE INTO\nTHE IMJAJ.  SUPPORTERS SAY THIS IS FAIR.\n>> DID YOU READ WHAT HE SAID? HE WAS POINTING OUT THAT THAT'S\nWHAT THE LEFT IS SAYING ABOUT ALL OF US NOW.\nMARIA JUST SAID PEOPLE IN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN ARE DEPLORABLE.\nI'M A JEWISH IMMIGRANT. I'M SORRY YOU THINK I'M\nDEPL DEPLORABLE.\n>> I DIDN'T SAY ALL. I DIDN'T SAY YOU.\n>> LISTEN, I LET YOU TALK. NOW LET ME TALK.\nLOOK AT THE BOTTOM LINE HERE. HILLARY CLINTON CALLED FARMERS,\nCOAL MINERS, MILITARY, SOLDIERS, NURSES, DOCTORS, SHE CALLED\nEVERYDAY PEOPLE OUT THERE DEPLORABLE AND SAID THE OTHER\nHALF ARE DESPERATE. SO WHAT'S LEFT?\nSHE MEANS THAT ALL OF DONALD TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS ARE EITHER\nDEPLORABLE AND IRREDEEMABLE OR DESPERATE.\nTHAT'S NOT HOW YOU WIN AN ELECTION.\nMARIA TALKED ABOUT INCLUSIVENESS.\nYES, THAT'S GREAT BUT HOW CAN YOU BE INCLUSIVE WHEN YOU SAY\nHALF OF AMERICA, AT LEAST HALF OF AMERICA IS EITHER\nIRREDEEMABLE -- >> SHE SAID HALF --\n>> THAT'S NOT WHAT SHE SAID. >> SHE DIDN'T SAY HALF OF\nAMERICA. BUT THAT SAID -- HOLD ON, HOLD\nON -- THAT SAID, HILLARY CLINTON DID SAY SOMETHING THAT PROBABLY\nWAS A POLITICAL MISTAKE AND THAT COMMENT WILL BE REPLAYED AND\nREPLAYED AND REPLAYED. YOU CAN BET THAT DONALD TRUMP IS\nGOING TO USE IT AT HIS CAMPAIGN EVENT IN BALTIMORE LATER TODAY.\nHIS SUPPORTERS WOULD SAY HE OUGHT TO.\n>> OF COURSE HE'S GOING TO USE THIS, BUT HE HAS FRANKLY USED\nEVERY SINGLE THING THAT HE CAN TO TRY TO BRING DOWN HILLARY\nCLINTON. LOOK, THIS IS THE NATURE OF THE\nCAMPAIGN. BUT AGAIN, WHAT HILLARY CLINTON\nSAID IS THAT THE KIND OF HATE AND VITRIOL THAT TRUMP AND HIS\nCAMPAIGN HAVE TRAFFICKED IN FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF THIS\nCAMPAIGN IS NOT SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE ACCEPTED AS NORMAL.\nSHE WAS FOCUSED ON THE FACT THAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS\nNORMALIZED THIS TRAFFICKING OF HATE AND THIS KIND OF VIOLENT,\nVIOLENT RHETORIC WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT PUNCHING PEOPLE AT HIS\nRALLIES BECAUSE THEY ARE PROTESTING HIM.\nWHEN YOU TALK ABOUT CALLING MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS RAPISTS AND\nCRIMINALS. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT BANNING A\nWHOLE RELIGION. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT WOMEN AS\nPIGS AND UGLY. THAT'S THE KIND OF RHETORIC AND\nTHOSE ARE THE KINDS OF FEELINGS THAT HILLARY CLINTON WAS TALKING\nABOUT WE CANNOT NORMALIZE AND THAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS\nACTUALLY LIFTED UP. >> BORIS?\n>> THAT'S NOT WHAT HILLARY CLINTON SAID.\n>> THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID. >> HILLARY CLINTON ATTACKED\nDONALD TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS. SHE ATTACKED THE VOTERS.\nSOMETHING THAT BARACK OBAMA IN 2012 SAID SHOULDN'T HAPPEN.\nSO IT'S DEMOCRATS OUT THERE WHO ARE SAYING THIS IS A MISTAKE.\nSOME OF THE OTHER DEMOCRATIC STRATEGISTS REALLY ARE IN TUNE\nENOUGH TO SAY HEY, IT WAS A MISTAKE AND JUST MOVE ON.\nFOR SOME REASON, OTHERS TRY TO SPIN IT AND SAY -- ACTUALLY WHAT\nSHE MEANT WAS THAT WE SHOULD BE INCLUSIVE.\nTHAT'S NOT WHAT SHE MEANT.

RIGHT?\nTHE RACIST, SEXIST, HOMOPHOBIC, ZEN FOEPIC, ISLAM PHOBIC, YOU\nNAME IT. >> DONALD TRUMP SEIZING ON\nCLINTON'S HARSH ASSESSMENT AND VOWING TO TAKE THE HIGH ROAD,\nQUITE, WHILE HILLARY SAID HORRIBLE THINGS ABOUT MY\nSUPPORTERS AND WHILE MANY OF HER SUPPORTERS WILL NEVER VOTE FOR\nME, I STILL RESPECT THEM ALL. CLINTON, BACK PEDALING A BIT BUT\nNOT EXACTLY APOLOGIZING QUOTE I REGRET SAYING HALF, THAT WAS\nWRONG. BUT LET'S BE CLEAR, WHAT'S\nREALLY DEPLORABLE IS THAT DONALD TRUMP HIRED A MAJOR ADVOCATE FOR\nTHE SO-CALLED ALT-RIGHT MOVEMENT TO RUN HIS CAMPAIGN AND THAT\nDAVID DUKE AND OTHER WHITE SUPREMACISTS SEE HIM AS A\nCHAMPION OF THEIR VALUES. IT'S DEPLORABLE THAT TRUMP HAS\nFILLED HIS CAMPAIGN LARGELY ON PREJUDICE AND PARANOIA SO I\nWON'T STOP CALLING OUT BIGOTRY AND RACIST RHETORIC IN THIS\nCAMPAIGN. BUT THIS MORNING, TRUMP SAID\nCLINTON'S COMMENTS COULD BE A DISASTER FOR HER CAMPAIGN.\n>> PERSONALLY WHEN I HEARD IT I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS NOT\nSOMETHING THAT WAS WITHIN THE REALM OF POSSIBLE THAT SHE WOULD\nHAVE SAID IT. AND I SAID TO MY PEOPLE, I DON'T\nBELIEVE SHE SAID IT. I THINK YOU HAVE TO CHECK IT\nBECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY THAT SHE SAID THIS.\nAND SHE ACTUALLY DID, AND SHE EVEN REALLY DOUBLED UP, BECAUSE\nIT WAS SAID WITH SUCH ANGER. AND SUCH UNBELIEVABLE ANGER.\nAND I THINK THIS IS THE BIGGEST MISTAKE OF THE POLITICAL SEASON.\nI REALLY DO. WHEN I SAW THIS IN ITS FULL\nFORM, AND I SAW THE ANGER WITH WHICH WE -- SHE SAID IT AND THEN\nTHE WAY SHE SPOKE, I THINK IT'S THE SINGLE BIGGEST MISTAKE OF\nTHE POLITICAL SEASON. >> SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS WITH\nME AGAIN CNN'S GLORIA BORGER, BRIANNA KEILAR AND MARK PRESTON.\nGLORIA, TRUMP SAYS THIS IS CLINTON'S 47% MOMENT.\nIS IT? >> YEAH, IT COULD BE.\nLOOK, IT'S BAD FOR HER. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WAS\nEXPRESSED VERY INARTFULLY, AND IT ALLOWED DONALD TRUMP TO TAKE\nTHE HIGH ROAD. AND ANY TIME YOU ALLOW DONALD\nTRUMP TO TAKE THE HIGH ROAD IN THIS CAMPAIGN, THAT'S A PROBLEM\nFOR YOU. WHAT WAS INTERESTING TO ME WAS\nHILLARY CLINTON'S RESPONSE. BECAUSE INSTEAD OF BACKING DOWN\nCOMPLETELY, SHE de SADED NOT TO. THAT SHE WAS GOING TO STAND BY\nHER COMMENTS, AND SAY, LOOK, THAT WAS A MISTAKE.\nBUT I STILL STAND BY WHAT I SAID ABOUT THE SO-CALLED ALT-RIGHT,\nAND THE, YOU KNOW, AND THE RACIST, AND SEXIST AND ALL THE\nREST. SO SHE WASN'T GOING TO GIVE HIM,\nYOU KNOW, THE, THE, THE ENTIRE THING.\nBUT SHE KNEW THAT YOU KNOW AND HER CAMPAIGN KNEW THAT SHE HAD,\nYOU KNOW, THAT SHE HAD MISSPOKEN.\nWHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS WHEN ARE THESE CANDIDATES GOING TO\nREALIZE THAT ALL OF THESE SO-CALLED CLOSED FUND-RAISERS,\nMITT ROMNEY WAS A CLOSED FUND-RAISER.\nTHIS WAS A CLOSED FUND-RAISER. THAT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS\nCLOSED. OR OFF THE RECORD ANYMORE.\nTHAT EVERYTHING YOU SAY IS GOING TO BECOME PUBLIC.\nAND SHE MADE A MISTAKE. AND DON'T FORGET ALSO, SHE WAS\nSICK AT THE TIME, RIGHT? NOW WE KNOW THAT SHE -- THAT SHE\nWAS ILL. >> YEAH, WE DO.\nAND YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT -- >> NOT TO EXCUSE IT BUT SHE WAS.\n>> SO BRIANNA CNN ALSO OBTAINED THESE TALKING POINTS, OR ITS\nSTRATEGY FROM THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN ABOUT HOW TO TALK ABOUT\nTHIS PARTICULAR THING. THEY'RE GOING TO BLAME THE\nMEDIA, SAYING IN PART, QUOTE, IT'S WELL PAST TIME THE PRESS\nSTOPPED GRADING TRUMP ON A CURVE.\nARE THEY GOING TO MAKE MORE OUT OF THIS STORY THAN THEY MADE OUT\nOF THE RACIST, MISOGYNISTIC TRUMP COMMENTS THAT GOT US HERE\nIN THE FIRST PLACE? SO BLAMING THE MEDIA, BRIANNA,\nCOME ON? >> WELL, I GENERALLY FIND THAT\nWHEN THAT IS THE STRATEGY, THAT JUST TELLS YOU THAT THEY'RE NOT\nCOMING FROM A PLACE OF STRENGTH. ANY CAMPAIGN THAT IS GOING AFTER\nTHE MEDIA, THAT'S REALLY WHAT THAT TELLS YOU.\nBUT ALSO THE GLORIA -- GLORIA'S POINT ABOUT THE FACT THAT\nHILLARY CLINTON WAS SICK AT THE TIME.\nIMAGINE, CAROL, HER TOP AIDES LOOKING BACK ON THIS NOW,\nBECAUSE WE ALL KNOW IF YOU ARE SICK, ESPECIALLY PNEUMONIA IS NO\nJOKE, IF YOU ARE ILL, YOU'RE NOT FEELING YOUR BEST, YOU'RE NOT\nPERFORMING YOUR BEST. AT WORK.\nI THINK EVERYONE CAN AGREE WITH THAT.\nAND SO THEY'RE LOOKING NOW BACK AT THIS AND REALIZING, SHE HAD A\nDIAGNOSIS OF PNEUMONIA ON FRIDAY, PUSHED THROUGH WITH HER\nSCHEDULE ON SATURDAY, AND THEY WERE NOT TRANSPARENT ABOUT THE\nPNEUMONIA. IMAGINE IF THEY HAD JUST BEEN,\nSAID SHE'S GOING TO LAY LOW FOR A LITTLE BIT, SHE'S GOING TO GO\nTO THE 9/11 MEMORIAL BUT OTHERWISE SHE'S GOING TO GET\nSOME REST, AND YOU WOULD HAVE THESE TWO HUGE ISSUES THAT HAVE\nMADE FOR THE WORST WEEKEND OF HER CAMPAIGN, THAT WOULD BE\nGONE. AND THIS IS SORT OF --\n>> SO -- >> I'M JUST GOING TO POINT OUT\nTHAT, THAT DONALD TRUMP'S CAMP ISN'T TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THAT\nHILLARY CLINTON HAD PNEUMONIA WHEN SHE SAID THESE THINGS.\nIN FACT THE TRUMP CAMP IS ALREADY OUT WITH A CAMPAIGN AD.\n>> OH, SURE BECAUSE WELL -- >> -- TO WEALTHY DONORS HILLARY\nCLINTON CALLED TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS DEPLORABLE.\n>> YOU COULD PUT HALF OF TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS INTO WHAT I CALL THE\nBASKET OF DEPLORABLES. THE RACIST, SEXIST, HOMOPHOBIC,\nZEN FOEPIC, ISLAM PHOBIC -- >> SO MARK, HOW MUCH OF A\nDIFFERENCE WILL LIKE PUT THIS INTO PERSPECTIVE FOR US HOW\nDAMAGING IS THIS? >> IT'S VERY DAMAGING.\nLET'S JUST TAKE A STEP BACK AND TALK ABOUT SIMILAR INSTANCES\nTHAT HAVE BEEN DAMAGING. YOU GO BACK TO THE 47% REMARK BY\nMITT ROMNEY. THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY DAMAGING TO\nHIS CAMPAIGN. YOU GO BACK TO BARACK OBAMA,\nBACK IN 2008, SAYING THAT VOTERS IN PENNSYLVANIA WERE CLINGING TO\nTHEIR GUNS AND RELIGION, THAT WAS DAMAGING TO HIS CAMPAIGN.\nYOU GO BACK JUST A WEEK AGO AND YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP PRAISING\nVLADIMIR PUTIN. THAT WAS DAMAGING TO HIS\nCAMPAIGN. SO TO THE POINT WHAT BRIANNA IS\nSAYING, TRANSPARENCY ACTUALLY IS FREEING IN MANY WAYS.\nTHE FACT THAT THEY DECIDED TO COVER THIS UP TO -- TO NOT BE AS\nOPEN AND HONEST ABOUT IT, THAT MEANS THAT THE COVER-UP IS\nACTUALLY WORSE THAN THE CRIME. RIGHT?\nTHE IDEA THAT THEY LEFT THE TRAVELING PRESS CORPS BEHIND\nBECAUSE THEY WANTED TO SQUIRE HER OFF AND TAKE CARE OF HER AND\nNOT ALLOW THE AMERICAN PUBLIC TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON, THAT IN\nITSELF IS DAMAGING. AND ALSO THE FACT THAT WHEN YOU\nDO START BLAMING THE MEDIA, IT DOES SHOW THAT YOU'RE NOT COMING\nFROM A PLACE OF STRENGTH AS BRIANNA NOTED.\nIT SHOWS THAT YOU'RE GRASPING. WE'VE SEEN THAT FROM THE TRUMP\nCAMPAIGN. WE'RE SEEING A LITTLE BIT OF\nTHAT NOW FROM THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN.\n>> ALL RIGHT I HAVE -- >> I NEED TO CORRECT MYSELF\nBECAUSE APPARENTLY THEY DID LET THE PRESS IN TO -- TO FILM HER\nSAYING THE DEPLORABLES COMMENT. THAT WAS A FUND-RAISER.\nTHEY ACTUALLY THIS WAS ACTUALLY POOLED AND THEY DID LET THE\nPRESS IN. >> SO IT WASN'T CLANDESTINELY\nSHOT. >> NO, NOT AT ALL.\nMY MISTAKE. MY MISTAKE.\n>> WHICH ACTUALLY MAKES IT WORSE, RIGHT?\n>> WELL, THERE YOU GO. >> YEAH, THERE YOU GO.\nI HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE. GLORNLG YEAH BORGER, BRIANNA\nKEILAR, MARK PRESTON, THANKS TO",

NOW, WE CAUGHT UP WITH THE\nFORMER SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON BEFORE THE\nDEPLORABLES COMMENT THAT WE'LL DISCUSS AND BEFORE THIS\nREVELATION ABOUT HER PNEUMONIA. WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU CLIPS OF\nTHAT INTERVIEW IN JUST A MOMENT. THE TIMING COULD NOT BE MORE\nURGENT. 57 DAYS TO THE ELECTION.\nONLY 11 DAYS UNTIL EARLY VOTING BEGINS IN SOME STATES.\nSO YOU HAVE VERY HIGH STAKES. AND THAT BRIS US TO THE MAJOR\nMOMENT OF THIS RACE. THE TWO CANDIDATES.\nFACING OFF IN THEIR FIRST DEBATE TWO WEEKS FROM TONIGHT.\nWE HAVE ALL THE ANGLES COVERED, LOTS OF NEW REPORTING.\nLET'S BEGIN WITH SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT JEFF\nZELENY. HE'S NEAR CLINTON'S HOPE IN\nCHAPPAQUA, NEW YORK. JEFF?\n>> GOOD MORNING, CHRIS. WELL ONE OF THE THINGS HILLARY\nCLINTON IS GOING TO BE DOING AS SHE'S RESTING AT HOME ISLAND\nTOLD IS PREPARING FOR THAT DEBATE.\nSHE'S OFF THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWO DAYS.\nSHE CANCELED HER SAN FRANCISCO AND LAS VEGAS FUND RAISERS.\nSHE'LL BE CALLING IN TO ONE OF THEM I'M TOLD.\nBUT SHE'S FINALLY FOLLOWING DOCTOR'S ORDERS AFTER BEING\nDIAGNOSED WITH MY MOAN YEAH AND DEHEAD RATION.\nBUT IT'S TURNED ALL OF THESE CONSPIRACY THEORIES ABOUT HER\nHEALTH INTO A FRONT AND CENTER CAMPAIGN ISSUE.\nHILLARY CLINTON, OFF THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL THIS MORNING AS\nSHE RECOVERS FROM PNEUMONIA. CANCELING A TWO-DAY TRIP TO\nCALIFORNIA. HER HEALTH THRUST INTO THE\nSPOTLIGHT, AFTER AIDES SAID SHE BECAME OVERHEATED AND DEHYDRATED\nWHILE ATTENDING THE 9/11 CEREMONY AT GROUND ZERO.\nTHIS VIDEO SHOWS CLINTON LEAVING EARLY, AND AS SHE TRIES STEPPING\nINTO HER VAN, SHE WOBBLES AND SLUMPS.\nSECRET SERVICE AGENTS AND AIDES QUICKLY GRAB HER AND HOLD HER\nUP. TWO LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCES\nTELLING CNN SHE APPEARED TO FAINT.\nCLINTON THEN TAKEN TO HER DAUGHTER CHELSEA'S APARTMENT\nTHREE MILES AWAY. MORE THAN AN HOUR LATER, CLINTON\nEMERGED, SMILING. >> IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY.\n>> Reporter: EVEN TAKING A PICTURE WITH A YOUNG GIRL BEFORE\nCLIMBING INTO HER MOTORCADE AND HEADING HOME.\nHER CAMPAIGN SAYS SHE WAS EVEN PLAYING WITH HER TWO GRAND KIDS\nINSIDE. YET MORE THAN FIVE HOURS LATER\nHER DOCTOR REVEALING THE 68-YEAR-OLD WAS DIAGNOSED WITH\nPNEUMONIA TWO DAYS EARLIER. >> CAN I GET SOME WATER?\n>> Reporter: AFTER AN EVALUATION FOR HER PROLONGED COUGH.\n>> EVERY TIME I THINK ABOUT TRUMP I GET ALLERGIC.\n>> Reporter: DESPITE THE DIAGNOSIS ON FRIDAY SHE\nCONTINUED A GRUELLING SCHEDULE. HOLDING TWO FUND-RAISERS IN NEW\nYORK CITY. A LARGE NATIONAL SECURITY\nBRIEFING, AND PRESS CONFERENCE. ALONG WITH AN INTERVIEW WITH OUR\nOWN CHRIS CUOMO AND OTHER MEDIA OUTLETS.\n>> HER HEALTH INCIDENT THIS MORNING?\n>> Reporter: DONALD TRUMP JUST FEET AWAY FROM HIS RIVAL AT\nGROUND ZERO UNUSUALLY QUIET OVER HER DIAGNOSIS.\nAFTER SPECULATING ABOUT HER HEALTH FOR MONTHS.\n>> I THINK SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA.\nHILLARY CLINTON DOES NOT HAVE THE STAMINA.\n>> I WATCHED HILLARY, WHO DOESN'T HAVE THE STRENGTH OR THE\nSTAMINA. >> Reporter: TRUMP ADDRESSING\nCLINTON'S HEALTH THIS MORNING, AND TOEING A RESPECTFUL LINE.\n>> SOMETHING'S GOING ON. BUT I JUST HOPE SHE GETS WELL\nAND GETS BACK ON THE TRAIL, AND WE'LL -- WE'LL BE SEEING HER AT\nTHE DEBATE. >> Reporter: TELLING REPORTERS\nTHAT HE IS PLANNING TO RELEASE RECORDS ABOUT HIS OWN HEALTH\nSOON. >> JUST LAST WEEK I TOOK A\nPHYSICAL, AND I'LL BE RELEASING WHEN THE NUMBERS COME IN,\nHOPEFULLY THEY'RE GOING TO BE GOOD.\nI THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE GOOD.\nI FEEL GREAT. BUT, WHEN THE NUMBERS COME IN,\nI'LL BE RELEASING VERY, VERY SPECIFIC NUMBERS.\n>> WELL, VERY, VERY SPECIFIC NUMBERS.\nBUT THAT IS JUST COMING LESS THAN TWO MONTHS BEFORE THE\nGENERAL ELECTION. AND IT IS A REMINDER, CHRIS AND\nALISYN, THAT AMERICAN VOTERS KNOW LESS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP,\nAGE 70, AND HILLARY CLINTON AGE 68, THAN THEY HAVE MOST RECENT\nPRESIDENTIAL NOMINEES HERE. SO THERE'S LITTLE DOUBT THAT\nMOST DEMOCRATS I'M TALKING TO THIS MORNING BELIEVE THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW SUIT AND RELEASE SOME MORE FULL\nRECORDS OF HER PAST HEALTH HISTORY, AS WELL HERE.\nBUT IT CERTAINLY HAS SHINED A NEW SPOTLIGHT ON THIS TWO WEEKS\nAFTER THAT FIRST DEBATE WHICH IS TWO WEEKS FROM TONIGHT HERE IN\nNEW YORK. >> OKAY, JEFF, THANK YOU VERY\nMUCH. DONALD TRUMP POUNCING ON\nCLINTON'S OTHER STUMBLE THIS WEEKEND.\nTRUMP'S CAMPAIGN RELEASING A NEW ATTACK AD HITTING HER ON HER\nBASKET OF DEPLORABLES COMMENT. CNN'S JASON CARROLL JOINS US NOW\nWITH MORE. TELL US.\n>> GOOD MORNING TO YOU. HE'S TALKING ABOUT IT THIS\nMORNING IN AN INTERVIEW THIS MORNING DONALD TRUMP SAYING\nHILLARY CLINTON'S COMMENT WAS THE BIGGEST POLITICAL MISTAKE OF\nTHE CAMPAIGN. HE ALSO SAID CLINTON MADE HER\nCOMMENTS OUT OF WHAT HE CALLED ANGER.\nAND THAT AS PRESIDENT YOU HAVE TO REPRESENT ALL OF THE PEOPLE.\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN ALSO HAS A BRAND-NEW ATTACK AD OUT THIS\nMORNING AND RUNNING IN BATTLEGROUND STATES SUCH AS\nFLORIDA, OHIO, PENNSYLVANIA, AND NORTH CAROLINA.\nIT HIGHLIGHTS THE MOMENT CLINTON MADE HER DEPLORABLE BASKET\nCOMMENT, WHICH SHE MADE FRIDAY NIGHT AT A FUND-RAISER IN NEW\nYORK. >> SPEAKING TO WEALTHY DONORS,\nHILLARY CLINTON CALLED TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS\nDEPLORABLE. >> YOU COULD PUT HALF OF TRUMP'S\nSUPPORTERS INTO WHAT I CALL THE BASKET OF DEPLORABLES.\nTHE RACIST, SEXIST, HOMOPHOBIC, JEN PHOBIC, ISLAM PHOBIC, YOU\nNAME IT. >> PEOPLE LIKE YOU, YOU AND YOU.\nDEPLORABLE. YOU KNOW WHAT'S DEPLORABLE?\nHILLARY CLINTON VISUALLY DEMONIZING HARD-WORKING PEOPLE\nLIKE YOU. >> I'M DONALD TRUMP, AND I\nAPPROVE THIS MESSAGE. >> CLINTON ALSO SAID THERE\nSHOULD BE EMPATHY FOR A NUMBER OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS WHO FEEL\nLETDOWN BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ECONOMY.\nSHE SAID THE BASKET OF DEPLORABLES WERE TRUMP\nSUPPORTERS WHO HAVE WHAT SHE CALLED RACIST AND XENOPHOBIC\nLEANINGS. CLINTON ALSO MENTIONED A RACIST\nWEBSITE WHICH SHE SAYS HAVE EXPANDED DURING TRUMP'S\nCANDIDACY. CLINTON RELEASED A STATEMENT\nCLARIFYING HER REMARKS, SAYING LAST NIGHT I WAS GROSSLY\nGENERALISTIC AND THAT'S NEVER A GOOD IDEA.\nI REGRET SAYING HALF, THAT WAS WRONG, BUT LET'S BE CLEAR,\nWHAT'S REALLY DEPLORABLE IS WHAT DONALD TRUMP -- IS THAT DONALD\nTRUMP HIRED A MAJOR ADVOCATE FROM THE SO-CALLED ALT-RIGHT\nMOVEMENT TO RUN HIS CAMPAIGN, AND THAT DAVID DUKE AND OTHER\nWHITE SUPREMACISTS SEE HIM AS A CHAMPION OF THEIR VALUES.\nIT SHOULD BE NOTED, THOUGH, THAT DONALD TRUMP ALSO HAS SAID HE\nREGRETS SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT HE HAS MADE ON THE CAMPAIGN\nTHOUGH HE WASN'T SPECIFIC ABOUT WHICH ONES THOUGH LAST MONTH HE\nDID ADMIT DURING A SPEECH THAT SOMETIMES HE SAYS YOU SAY WHAT\nHE CALLED THE WRONG THING. CHRIS?\n>> I'LL TAKE IT HERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, JASON.\nSO WE ARE NOW JOINED BY RETIRED LIEUTENANT GENERAL MICHAEL\nFLYNN. GENERAL FLYNN IS A FOREIGN\nPOLICY ADVISER TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.\nGENERAL, THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.\n>> HI, ALI, HOW ARE YOU DOING? >> I'M DOING WELL.\nARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT SECRETARY CLINTON'S HEALTH?\n>> I HOPE THAT SHE'S OKAY. I MEAN I REALLY DO.\nI JUST HOPE THAT -- YOU NEVER WANT TO, YOU KNOW, THINK OF\nANYTHING DIFFERENT THAN THAT. SO I MEAN, I HAVE FOUR SISTERS.\nMY MOTHER JUST RECENTLY PASSED AWAY.\nSO I JUST HOPE SHE'S OKAY >> YOU ACCEPT THAT SHE HAS\nPNEUMONIA, AND SHE WAS WEAK FROM PNEUMONIA?\n>> WHATEVER THEY PUT OUT. I MEAN, I JUST, YOU KNOW, I JUST\nTHINK THAT -- I MEAN IT'S -- YOU KNOW, IT IS WHAT IT IS.\nI JUST HOPE THAT SHE'S OKAY. >> IS IT TIME FOR BOTH\nCANDIDATES TO RELEASE MORE THOROUGH COMPREHENSIVE MEDICAL\nRECORDS? >> SURE.\nI MEAN I THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW, ANY WAYS THAT PEOPLE THAT ARE\nRUNNING FOR PRESIDENT CAN BE MORE TRANSPARENT WITH THE\nAMERICAN PUBLIC SO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC CAN MAKE A MORE INFORMED\nDECISION, THAT'S JUST SMART. THAT'S A SMART THING TO DO.\n>> WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE FROM DPM?\nBECAUSE ALL HE HAS RELEASED IS A LETTER THAT WAS SOMEWHAT\nLAUGHABLE FROM HIS DOCTOR SAYING THAT HE'S IN BASICALLY\nASTONISHINGLY GOOD HEALTH. >> YEAH, I'VE BEEN AROUND DONALD\nTRUMP QUITE A BIT, ACTUALLY, ESPECIAL HIS OVER THE LAST MONTH\nOR SO. AND I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I'VE --\nI'VE ALWAYS FELT LIKE I'VE STAYED, YOU KNOW, IN GOOD SHAPE\nMYSELF. THIS IS A GUY THAT ENORMOUS\nSTAMINA. I WATCH HIM MOVE FROM CITY TO\nCITY, EVENT TO EVENT. ENGAGE ROBUSTLY WITH A LOT OF\nPEOPLE, AND -- AND HE'S A PRETTY AMAZING GUY.\n>> LOOK. I'M ASTONISHED BY BOTH THEIR\nSTAMINA. 24/7 THE PUNISHING CAMPAIGN\nTRAIL. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT AT\nANY AGE, MUST LESS 68 AND 70 YEARS OLD.\n>> I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'D WANT TO DO IT.\n>> I DON'T KNOW EITHER. HOWEVER ARE YOU CALLING FOR\nDONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON TO RELEASE MORE MEDICAL RECORDS?\n>> I THINK WHAT WE NEED IS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER\nWAYS THAT WE CAN BECOME MORE TRANSPARENT WITH EVERYTHING THAT\nWE'RE DOING, I MEAN, EVERYTHING --\n>> HOW ABOUT THIS TAXES -- >> ALL THIS STUFF.\nYOU KNOW, IT WILL ALL EVENTUALLY COME OUT TO THE POINT WHERE\nPEOPLE CAN MAKE A JUDGMENT. >> WILL IT?\n-- >> HONESTLY, ALI, I REALLY THINK\nTHAT THE BIGGER ISSUES THAT ARE IN PLAY FOR THE AMERICAN PUBLIC\nIN MANY OF THESE ENGAGEMENTS THAT I'VE BEEN A PART OF, THOSE\nARE LESSER ISSUES THAN -- THAN THE POOR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS\nTHAT WE FACE, THE MILITARY READINESS THAT WE FACE.\nI MEAN SO THERE'S SO MANY OTHER BIG ISSUES.\nI MEAN YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN TALKING ALL MORNING ABOUT ISIS,\nAND WHAT'S GOING ON. I MEAN THE AMERICAN -- THE U.S.\nGOVERNMENT JUST CUT A DEAL WITH RUSSIA AND HERE WE'VE BEEN\nTALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY'S BEEN BEATING UP\nTRUMP FOR DEALING WITH RUSSIA AND HERE WE ARE, OUR GOVERNMENT\nIS GOT A DEAL GOING WITH RUSSIA TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS RISE\nOF THE RADICAL ISLAMISM. >> YEAH I MEAN LOOK IT'S ABOUT\nBEING AN EDUCATED CONSUMER OF YOUR CANDIDATE.\n>> YEAH. >> SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU DO\nBELIEVE THAT MORE ABOUT HIS TAXES WILL COME OUT?\nHE WILL RELEASE MORE OF HIS TAXES?\n>> EVENTUALLY THEY WILL. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE, I\nKNOW THEY'RE DEALING WITH THAT. THIS WHOLE YOU KNOW IT'S UNDER\nAUDIT AND ALL THAT. I MEAN THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT\nFRANKLY, I DON'T THINK 90% OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ACTUALLY\nPAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT'S GOING ON CARE ABOUT.\n>> SHOULDN'T THEY? SHOULDN'T THEY CARE IF THEIR\nCANDIDATE DIDN'T PAY TAXES? >> I'M NOT GOING TO ARGUE WITH\nYOU ABOUT THE TAX ISSUE. TO ME WE HAVE SUCH A POOR -- OUR\nECONOMY RIGHT NOW IS SO POOR. IT IS OPERATING AT ABOUT MAYBE\n1% OR 2% GROWTH. THAT'S TERRIBLE.\nOUR MILITARY READINESS, MODERNIZATION, TRAINING, IS --\nIS ACTUALLY AT A PLACE NOW WHERE ALL OF OUR -- OR FOR THE MOST\nPART, MANY OF OUR CHIEFS OF OUR SERVICES HAVE SAID WE'RE NOT\nREADY. WE ARE NOT READY.\nOUR MILITARY IS NOT READY, YET LOOK AT THE THREATS THAT WE FACE\nAROUND THE WORLD. I MEAN EVERYTHING.\nWE JUST SAW NORTH KOREA TEST POTENTIALLY ANOTHER NUCLEAR\nWEAPON. WE'VE GOT CHINA ACTING LIKE THEY\nOWN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA. WE'VE GOT RUSSIA IN EAST EUROPE.\nI MEAN ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON AND WE\nALSO LOOK RIGHT HERE IN THE HOMELAND, AND LOOK AT THE\nTHREATS THAT WE FACE HERE IN THE HOMELAND.\nAND THE ECONOMIC THREAT IS STILL, IF YOU WERE TO ASK ME\nWHAT'S THE GREATEST THREAT TO OUR COUNTRY?\nIT'S THE ECONOMIC THREATS. THE THREAT IS TOUR ECONOMY.\n>> CHRIS CUOMO SAT DOWN WITH HILLARY CLINTON EXCLUSIVELY.\nHE TALKED ABOUT NORTH KOREA WITH HER AFTER NORTH KOREA FIRED\nCARRIED OUT ITS FIFTH NUCLEAR TEST SETTING OFF OF COURSE ALARM\nBELLS AROUND THE WORLD. LET'S LISTEN TO WHERE SECRETARY\nCLINTON STANDS ON THE THREAT POSED BY KIM JUNK UN'S REGIME.\n>> NORTH KOREA. >> YEAH.\n>> THERE IS NOW WORD THAT NOT ONLY WAS THIS A TEST BUT IT\nCOULD BE A SIGN THAT THEY COULD HAVE A WARHEAD A SMALL ONE IN A\nSHORTER TIME FRAME THAN HAD BEEN REASON -- RECENTLY EXPECTED.\nWE REMEMBER WITH SYRIA THE LINE IN THE SAND THAT THE PRESIDENT\nDREW. WHEN YOU LOOK AT NORTH KOREA, IF\nYOU WERE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, WHAT WOULD BE YOUR LINE\nIN THE SAND THAT IF THIS SUPPOSED MAD MAN IN NORTH KOREA\nGETS A WEAPON THAT IF HE CROSSES THIS LINE, IT'S NO LONGER JUST\nABOUT SANCTIONS? >> OH, I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE THAT\nIT HAS TO BE MADE VERY CLEAR, WE WILL NOT ALLOW NORTH KOREA TO\nHAVE A DELIVERABLE NUCLEAR WEAPON.\nAND WE WILL APPROACH THIS FROM A NUMBER OF PERSPECTIVES.\nFIRST, WE WILL PROTECT OUR ALLIES BY GIVING THEM THE MOST\nSOPHISTICATED MISSILE DEFENSE PROTECTION THAT WE CAN.\nWE WILL MAKE IT CLEAR TO CHINA, WHICH IS NOT ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT\nTHAT, OR RUSSIA, WHICH ALSO BORDERS NORTH KOREA, THAT WE\nHAVE NO CHOICE. WE ARE NOT ABOUT TO SIT AND\nWATCH THIS DEVELOP AND THE WAY THAT THEY COULD HELP US IS BY\nEXERTING PRESSURE WITH US THAT WOULD ADJUST THE REGIME'S\nAMBITIONS. AND IT HAS TO BE PART OF A VERY\nTOUGH, COMPREHENSIVE NEGOTIATION.\nI HAD CONVERSATIONS IN THE PAST WITH THE CHINESE ABOUT NORTH\nKOREA. UP UNTIL RELATIVELY RECENTLY, I\nTHINK THEY WERE UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY COULD\nCONTROL THEIR NEIGHBOR, AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO CRACK DOWN\nBECAUSE THEY SAW IT AS A USEFUL CARD TO PLAY.\nGETS A LITTLE CRAZY, MAYBE THE SOUTH KOREANS WILL, YOU KNOW,\nMOVE TOWARD THEM A LITTLE BIT GETS A LITTLE CRAZIER, MAYBE\nTHEY CAN MAKE SOME DEALS WITH THE JAPANESE ABOUT SOME THINGS\nTHEY WANT. IT WAS A STRATEGIC CALCULATION.\nIT'S NOT THAT WAY ANYMORE. THE CURRENT LEADER IS\nUNPREDICTABLE FOR MOTT THE CHINESE AND THE REST OF US.\nTHE CURRENT LEADER IS CLEARLY INTENT UPON IGNORING PRESSURE,\nADVICE, OF ANY SORT COMING FROM ANYWHERE ELSE.\nAND SO WE'VE GOT TO MAKE IT CLEAR, MISSILE DEFENSE IS GOING\nIN AS QUICKLY AND BROADLY AS POSSIBLE.\nOUR MESSAGE, TO NORTH KOREANS AND EVERYONE ELSE LISTENING,\nTHEY WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO ACQUIRE A NUCLEAR WEAPON THAT\nHAS A DELIVERABLE CAPACITY ON A BALLISTIC MISSILE.\nAND WE'VE GOT TO START INTENSIFYING OUR DISCUSSIONS\nWITH THE CHINESE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T POSSIBLY WANT THIS BIG\nPROBLEM ON THEIR DOORSTEP. >> WHEN THEY SAY TO YOU WHAT\nDOES THAT MEAN THEY WON'T BE ALLOWED TO HAVE ONE?\n>> WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO IN TO ALL THE DETAILS.\nI MEAN OBVIOUSLY THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT I HAVE THE RIGHT\nTO DO OR THE RESPONSIBILITY AT THIS MOMENT TO DO.\nBUT THAT WILL BE THE POLICY OF MY ADMINISTRATION.\nBECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO MAKE PROGRESS -- ADDING\nADDITIONAL SANCTIONS, AND DOING IT THE WAY THAT WE DID THAT I\nLED WITH IRAN DID HAVE A BIG IMPACT BECAUSE THEY WORKED.\nTHE CHINESE HAVE BEEN AWFULLY LEAKY, YOU KNOW, THE REGIME\nLIVES OFF OF LUXURY GOODS, AND THE KIND OF BENEFITS THAT THEY\nTHEN CAN USE TO, YOU KNOW, REWARD THEIR LOYAL FOLLOWERS.\nWE'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO FULLY CUT THAT OFF.\nAND SO WE WILL DO MORE ON SANCTIONS, BECAUSE THAT'S PART\nOF AN OVERALL STRATEGY. BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.\n>> GENERAL WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HER PRESCRIPTION AGAINST NORTH\nKOREA? >> I MEAN, FIRST OF ALL, SHE WAS\nTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOUR YEARS AND WHEN WE STARTED UP\nTHIS PIVOT TO THE STRATEGY THAT WE HAVE, WHICH NOBODY EVEN TALKS\nABOUT ANYMORE BECAUSE IT'S A COMPLETE FAILURE.\nI MEAN, YOU'VE GOT TO -- I MEAN, YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT OF TALK\nABOUT NORTH KOREA AND WHAT'S HAPPENING OUT THERE IN THE\nREGION. WE ALWAYS SAY CHINA HAS TO DO\nMORE. I AGREE.\nCHINA HAS TO DO MORE. WE FACING A SET OF THREATS\nAROUND THE WORLD, AND THE LACK OF RESPECT BY MANY AROUND THE\nWORLD, FOR US TO TELL NORTH KOREA DON'T DO THIS, AND THEN\nTHEY DO IT. SO THE LACK OF RESPECT AROUND\nTHE WORLD BY MANY, BY MANY OF THESE ROGUE REGIMES, AND FRANKLY\nBY SOME OF OUR ALLIES AND FRIENDS AROUND THE WORLD, IS\nJUST -- IT'S STUNNING. IT'S TO THE POINT WHERE, YOU\nKNOW, LIKE I'VE SAID BEFORE, WE'VE BECOME THE WORST FRIENDS\nIN THE WORLD. BEST ENEMIES, BECAUSE WE\nCONSTANTLY TALK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO AND WE DON'T RESPECT\nTHE FRIENDS AND ALLIES THAT WE HAVE THAT ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE\nSOME OF THE GOALS THAT THEY HAVE.\nSO I MEAN, THIS -- THIS IS A BIG ISSUE.\nTHE WHOLE ISSUE WITH RED LINES, DON'T -- A RED LINE IS LIKE\nSAYING I'M GOING TO SEND 500 MORE GUYS TO IRAQ.\nDON'T STATE A RED LINE. DON'T -- DON'T BE PREDICTABLE.\nAND I THINK WHAT WE, YOU KNOW, WITH IN THE CASE OF NORTH KOREA,\nI MEAN HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO KEEP TALKING TO THEM AND\nTALKING TO THEM AND TELLING THE CHINESE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT\nIT, AND THEY JUST KEEP -- THEY JUST KEEP FOLLOWING THROUGH WITH\nTHESE TESTS. >> LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THAT --\n>> VERY DANGEROUS. VERY DANGEROUS COUNTRY\nABSOLUTELY. >> DONALD TRUMP HAS SAID\nBASICALLY THAT NORTH KOREA IS CHINA'S PROBLEM.\n>> CHINA HAS THE BIGGEST INFLUENCE OVER NORTH KOREA --\n>> CAN WE LEAVE IT TO CHINA TO DEAL WITH NORTH KOREA?\n>> I THINK WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH CHINA THROUGH STRENGTH.\n>> WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE? >> THAT MEANS A MORE READY\nMILITARY, A STRONGER ECONOMY, AND THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT\nWE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHERE WE HAVE TO STOP HAVING CHINA DO\nEVERYTHING FOR OUR COUNTRY ECONOMICALLY.\nI MEAN THAT'S A BIG DEAL. THIS WHOLE, YOU KNOW,\nTRANS-PACIFIC TRADE AGREEMENT WITH CHINA.\nI MEAN, I JUST THINK THAT THERE'S SO MANY -- THERE'S SO\nMANY THINGS THAT WE ARE INVOLVED IN TODAY THAT HAVE JUST BEEN\nUTTER FAILURES OVER FRANKLY THE LAST COUPLE OF DECADES\n>> YOU'RE COMFORTABLE LETTING NORTH KOREA --\n>> THE ISSUE OF NORTH KOREA AND THE POTENTIAL FOR NORTH KOREA TO\nHAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS YOU GO BACK AND YOU LOOK AT WHEN BILL\nCLINTON WAS THE PRESIDENT AND ALL THESE NEGOTIATIONS WERE HAD\nJUST LIKE WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH IRAN RIGHT NOW SO THIS\nADMINISTRATION CUT A DEAL WITH IRAN TO PUT THEM ON A PATHWAY TO\nA NUCLEAR WEAPON. IN THE BILL CLINTON\nADMINISTRATION THEY CUT A DEAL WITH NORTH KOREA ESSENTIALLY AND\nIT HAS LED TO NOW THIS PROBLEM, YOU KNOW, 20 YEARS, 25 YEARS\nLATER. SO I MEAN, WE'VE GOT TO STOP\nTALKING IN THE WAY THAT WE TALK BECAUSE IT'S POLITICAL TALK.\nAND WE HAVE TO BE VERY PRACTICAL AND WE HAVE TO BE VERY BLUNT IN\nSOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE ARE HAVING.\nTHIS DIPLOMATIC SPEAK THAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT, IT ACTUALLY\nHASN'T WORKED IN DECADES.

HAVE YOU SEEN THE HEALTH RECORDS\nOR THE NOTE THAT HER DOCTOR HAS RELEASED?\n>> YEAH. >> WHAT DID THAT OUTLINE?\nWHY IS THAT NOT SATISFYING TO MANY PEOPLE?\n>> IT'S A SUMMARY. TWO-PAGE LETTER THAT IS A\nSUMMARY OF HER HEALTH. SHE HAD A DEEP VENUS THROMBOSIS\nBACK IN 1998 AND BACK IN 2009. >> THAT'S A CLOTTING DISORDER.\n>> THAT IS A BLOOD CLOT IN THE LEGS.\n>> DVT. YOU CAN'T FLY WITH IT AND STUFF\nLIKE THAT. >> IT COULD BREAK OFF AND GO TO\nTHE LUNGS, THAT IS A PULMONARY EMBOLISM.\nSHE WAS ON A BLOOD THINNER AT LEAST SINCE 2009 BECAUSE OF THAT\nDVT. BUT THE THING IN 2012 THE\nBIGGEST CONCERN WHERE SHE FELL AND HIT HER HEAD AND HAD A\nCONCUSSION, A TYPE OF BRAIN INJURY AND ALSO DEVELOPED A\nBLOOD CLOT AROUND THE BRAIN AT THAT TIME, AS WELL.\n>> ANYTHING THAT JUMPS OUT AT YOU AS PARTICULARLY ABNORMAL FOR\nHER AGE? >> NO, I MEAN, I THINK THE THING\nIN 2012 IS NOT A COMMON THING TO CERTAINLY HIT YOUR HEAD AND\nCERTAINLY DEVELOP THIS BLOOD CLOT AROUND THE BRAIN.\nTHERE WAS NOTHING ABOUT IT THAT DIDN'T MAKE SENSE.\nSHE WAS ON A BLOOD THINNER ALREADY BEFORE SHE HIT HER HEAD\nSO THAT WAS THE ONE THING THAT WAS CURIOUS.\nIF YOU'RE ON A BLOOD THINNER, YOU'RE AT MORE RISK OF BLEEDING\nTHAN CLOTTING. SHE ACTUALLY DEVELOPED A BLOOD\nCLOT AFTER THAT BRAIN INJURY IN 2012.\nAFTER THAT, IT FITS, IT MAKES SENSE.\n>> HERE'S THE LARGER QUESTION THAT THIS RAISES AND RAISED IN A\nCOMEDIC SENSE WITH THE TRUMP DOCTOR THAT PUT OUT THAT LETTER\nABOUT HIM. THESE PEOPLE, ONE OF THEM, IS\nGOING TO BE THE NEXT LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD.\nDO YOU THINK WE NEED TO KNOW MORE IN GENERAL?\nYOU KNOW, JUST LIKE WE'RE GOING AFTER TRUMP FOR HIS TAXES.\nWE WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU ARE FINANCIALLY.\nDO YOU THINK THE TIME HAS COME IN AMERICA TO KNOW MORE ABOUT\nTHE PHYSICAL WELL BEING OF THE PERSON WHO MAY LEAD YOU?\n>> I THINK ABSOLUTELY. I THINK THAT TIME WAS PROBABLY\nCOME A WHILE AGO. IT'S REMARKABLE HOW LITTLE WE DO\nKNOW ABOUT OUR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES AS I THINK YOU'RE\nPOINTING OUT. IT'S COMING INTO MUCH CLEARER\nFOCUS IN THIS PARTICULAR ELECTION IN PART BECAUSE OF THE\nAGE AND IN PART NOW BECAUSE OF THIS HEALTH ISSUE.\nWHETHER IT'S AN INDEPENDENT GROUP OF DOCTORS SEPARATE FROM\nTHEIR OWN DOCTORS. A COLLEGIATE RELATIONSHIP\nBETWEEN THE DOCTORS AND THEY'RE FRIENDS.\nNOT THE OBJECTIVE DATA THAT YOU JUST WOULD WANT.\nSO, MAYBE IT'S INDEPENDENT DOCTORS BACK IN 2008.\nSENATOR McCAIN INVITED A GROUP OF REPORTERS COME EVALUATE HIS\nMEDICAL RECORDS FOR SEVERAL HOURS.\nI WAS ONE OF THOSE REPORTERS. THAT'S HOW HE DECIDED TO HANDLE\nIT. WE KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT THESE\nTWO CANDIDATES AND THE TIME HAS COME, MAYBE THE TIME HAS COME\nQUITE SOME TIME AGO. >> WHY ARE YOU HEARING ABOUT WHY\nTHE CAMPAIGN DID NOT DISCLOSE THAT SHE HAD PNEUMONIA UNTIL\nAFTER THE STUMBLE INTO THE VAN UNTIL AFTER SHE SEEMED FAINT AND\nALL THAT STUFF THAT RAISED A LOT OF QUESTIONS WHEN, HAD THEY SAID\nIT 24 HOURS EARLIER, THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ANSWERED.\n>> I THINK A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY EXACTLY THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN DECIDED TO DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION AT A RATHER SLOW\nPACE, NOT JUST OVER THE WEEKEND BUT AND DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA\nWHY NOT SAY IT IMMEDIATELY AFTER SHE LOST THE WORLD TRADE CENTER\nSITE. THIS IS IMPORTANT AND SANJAY\nALLUDED TO IT HERE, THESE ARE PEOPLE AND PRIVATE HEALTH ISSUES\nAND VERY PERSONAL INCLINATIONS ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY WANT TO\nSHARE AND ONLY SO MUCH THEIR STAFF CAN DO TO COUNTERACT THAT.\nIF YOUR CANDIDATE DOESN'T WANT TASHARE\nTO SHARE SOMETHING ABOUT THEIR HEALTH.\n>> MAYBE IT SHOULDN'T BE THEIR CALL, THOUGH.\nYOU WANT TO GET A CONTRACT TO PLAY PROFESSIONAL SPORTS WITH A\nTEAM, THEY PUT YOU THROUGH A BATTERY OF PHYSICAL EXAMS TO\nMAKE SURE YOU'RE WORTH THE INVESTIN\nINVE INVESTMENT.\n>> WE HAVE TO KNOW, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THEM\nPHYSICALLY. EVEN ONCE THEY'RE IN OFFICE, YOU\nDON'T KNOW. YOU HBACK TO DICK CHENEY, YOU\nWOULD HAVE TO HAVE SOMEONE LIKE SANJAY GOING IN AND DEEP\nINVESTIGATING TO FIGURE OUT LITTLE CLUES.\nTHAT'S THE LARGER ISSUE. WE GET TO THE GOOD POINT THAT\nALISYN IS RAISING. IT'S ABOUT HER HEALTH AND ALSO\nABOUT THE NATURE OF THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN DISCLOSURE.\nOH, IT WAS TOO HOT. OH, IT IS THE HYPERTHYROIDISM.\nOH, BY THE WAY, SHE HAD PNEU\nPNEUMONIA. THAT IS THE CRITICISM, YOU ONLY\nHEAR WHAT THEY WANT TO TELL YOU WHEN THEY HAVE TO TELL YOU.\n>> THAT'S WHY THIS IS AN UNFORCED ERROR.\nIF THEY CAME OUT AND SAID SHE HAD PNEUMONIA AND TOUGHS IT OUT\nAND GOES TO A 9/11 MEMORIAL AND SHE FAINTS, THAT'S\nUNDERSTANDABLE. JUDGING BY MY TWITTER FEED, A\nLOT OF PEOPLE HAD PNEUMONIA. JUST THAT BALANCE THAT THEY\nHAVEN'T ACHIEVED AS TO WHAT THE PUBLIC NEEDS TO KNOW THAT THIS\nPERSON IS SICK. PNEU\nPNEUMONIA, DOCTOR KNOWS BETTER THAN I DO, IT IS SERIOUS.\nWHAT THEY CAN KEEP HIDDEN UNTIL THEY ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO UNTIL\nSHE FAINTS INTO A VAN. DIDN'T LOOK GOOD YESTERDAY.\n>> BACK TO ANOTHER UNFORCED ERROR.\nTHAT IS SOMETHING SHE SAID. WHERE SHE TALKED ABOUT TRUMP\nSUPPORTERS. INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT DONALD\nTRUMP WHICH SHE HAS DONE FOR MANY MONTHS, SHE DECIDED TO TALK\nABOUT HIS SUPPORTERS. LET'S LISTEN TO THAT COMMENT.\n>> JUST BE GROSSLY GENERALISTIC, YOU COULD PUT HALF OF TRUMP'S\nSUPPORTERS INTO WHAT I CALL THE BASKET OF DEPLORABLES.\nRIGHT? THE RACIST, SEXIST, HOMOPHOBIC,\nISLAMAPHOBIC. >> THIS WAS AT A FUNR, IN\nWHAT CAMPAIGN PLAYBOOK IS IT WISE TO GO AFTER YOUR OPPONENT'S\nSUPPORTERS? >> SHE SAID VARIATIONS ON THIS\nBEFORE. SAID SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR ON\nISRAELI TELEVISION LAST WEEK. >> SHE WASN'T TALKING ABOUT THE\nWORKING MAN EITHER, RIGHT? SOMEWHAT OF A DEFINED CRITICISM.\n>> ONE SET OF DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTERS IS THIS BASKET OF\nDEPLORABLES OR WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL THEM AND THE OTHER HALF\nYOU NEED TO TAKE MORE SERIOUSLY THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT GOVERNMENT.\nI DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE GOING TO SEE CLINTON PROSECUTE HER OWN\nDEFENSE HERE IN THE WAY WE WOULD HAVE IF NOT FOR THIS HEALTH\nINCIDENT. I THINK AS OF FRIDAY EVENING\nTALKING TO A LOT OF DEMOCRATS, THEY WERE VERY HAPPY TO HAVE AN\nARGUMENT OVER EXACTLY WHAT SHARE OF DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTERS ARE\nRACIST. BUT IF SHE CAN'T MAKE THAT CASE\nHERSELF IN AN AGGRESSIVE AND TEXTURED WAY THAT REALLY\nEMPHASIZES THE MORE SYMPATHETIC PART OF HER STATEMENT, I DON'T\nKNOW THAT WE'LL EVER SEE THAT PLAY OUT THE WAY DEMOCRATS WANT\nTO. >> VERY EASILY TAKEN OUT OF\nCONTEXT. >> IT WAS AND IT WILL BE USED IN\nAN AD. WE HAVE IT THIS MORNING.\n>> THERE YOU GO. ALSO AT A FUND-RAISER.\nSHE'S SAYING IT TO HER RICH FRIENDS AND BEHIND CLOSED DOORS,\nEVEN THOUGH IT IS ON CAMERA AND NOT TO THE PUBLIC.\nALSO IN TERMS OF THE PERCEPTION ISN'T THAT GREAT.\n>> PANEL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE APPRECIATE THE INSIGHT.\n>> SANJAY, THANKS FOR RAISING THE BIGGER ISSUE OF THE PEOPLE\nWHO WANT TO BE OUR LEADERS AND",

GOOD EVENING, JOHN.\n>> GOOD EVENING, BRETT, YOU CAN BET THAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS\nGOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THAT  COME, BUT TODAY IT WAS ALL ABOUT\nREMEMBRANCE. IT IS A DAY TO SET ASIDE\nPOLITICS, AND FLANKED BY RUDY GIULIANO AND MAYOR BILL De\nBLASIO, AND CHRIS CHRISTIE, AND IN ERNST, IT SHOWS A TIGHT RACE,\nAND IN NEVADA, HILLARY CLINTON IS UP BY A SINGLE POINT, AND NEW\nHAMPSHIRE A SAME THING, AND THAT IS GOOD FOR TRUMP, BUT THE BAD\nNEWS IS ARIZONA AND GEORGIA, AND TWO STATES RELIABLY RED, AND IT\nIS UNCOMFORTABLY TIGHT. AND IN THE WEEKS, TRUMP WILL\nCOMMENT ON THE COMMENTS AT A FUND-RAISER ABOUT TRUMP SUPPORTERS.\n>> YOU CAN PUT HALF OF THE TRUMP SUPPORTERS IN WHAT I CALL THE\nBASKET OF DEPLORABLES. >> ROMNEY WAS HAMMERED ABOUT 47%\nDEPENDENT ON THE GOVERNMENT, AND SHE JUST MADE A STATEMENT IN\nWHICH SHE LUMPED TOGETHER MILLIONS OF AMERICANS.\n>> AND TRUMP HAS TWEET AD RESPONSE SAYING THAT WHILE MANY\nOF HER SUPPORTERS WILL NEVER VOTE FOR ME, I STILL RESPECT\nTHEM ALL. AND RUNNING MATE MIKE PENCE\nPOUNCED ON IT. >> HILLARY, THEY ARE NOT A\nBASKET OF ANYTHING. THEY ARE AMERICANS AND THEY\nDESERVE YOUR RESPECT. >> BUT IN THE TWO WEEKS LEFT\nUNTIL THE FIRST DEBATE, TRUMP WILL BE PLAYING DEFENSE AT A\nNUMBER OF POINTS, INCLUDING THE CONTINUED PRAISE OF RUSSIAN\nPRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN. >> WELL, HIS IGNORANCE ABOUT\nRUSSIAN PUTIN ARE DANGEROUS. IT SENDS THE MESSAGE THAT MAYBE\nTHE UNITED STATES NEVER REALLY STANDS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS OR\nFREEDOM OR HUMAN DIGNITY AND STANDS AGAINST AGGRESSIVE\nBEHAVIORS. >> THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN CAREFULLY\nSTAYED AWAY FROM ANY COMMENT ABOUT HER MEDICAL ISSUE.\nEARLIER TODAY, AS JENNIFER GRIFFIN POINTED OUT HE HAS\nPOINTED OUT THAT SHE DOES NOT HAVE THE STAMINA TO BE\nPRESIDENT. AND HE IS GOING TO BE IN\nBALTIMORE TOMORROW ADDRESSING THE GUARD ASSOCIATION, AND THEN\nA BIG RALLY IN ASHEVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA, FOR A FUND-RAISING\nRALLY IN THE EVENING. >> LET'S BRING IN A PANEL.\nOKAY. THE HEALTH ISSUE, WHAT HAPPENED\nTODAY, AND HOW BIG OF A DEAL, GUY?\n>> WELL, ON A PERSONAL LEVEL, I'M PLEASED TO HEAR OR SEE THAT\nMRS. CLINTON IS BETTER AND  VIDEO TO WATCH, AND NO GETTING\nAROUND THAT. AND POLITICALLY, THERE ARE TWO\nTHINGS AT PLAY, AND FIRST AS THIS UNFOLDED THIS MORNING, I\nSAW A LOT OF HER SUPPORTERS ON SOCIAL MEDIA ANGRILY LAMENTING\nTHAT THIS IS GOING TO FUEL CONSPIRACY THEORIES ABOUT THE\nHEALTH, BUT HER TEAM DID NOT SERVE HER WELL TO KEEP THE PRESS\nIN THE DARK FOR 90 MINUTES, AND DENYING THE PRESS POOL TO TRAVEL\nWITH HER TO CHAPPAQUA FOR THE CONVELESS SENSE, AND IT IS NOT\nTHE WAY THAT YOU SQUELCH RUMORS AN CONJECTURE, AND BRIEFLY,\nSECONDLY, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS WHOLE SITUATION, I THINK THAT\nOVERALL, THE PACKAGE OF TWO BIG ISSUES THERE.\nTHE HEALTH VIDEO PLAYS MORE SIGNIFICANTLY AND MORE LASTING\nIN THE MINDS OF THE PERSUADABLE  WILL PLAY AS A BASE FOR THE\nMOTIVATOR FOR TRUMP VOTERS. >> I AGREE IT IS TOUGH TO WATCH.\nAND SHE WAS DIAGNOSED APPARENTLY WITH PNEUMONIA ON FRIDAY, AND ON\nFRIDAY, SHE RAN THE TWO-HOUR NATIONAL SECURITY MEETING AND\nHELD A PRESS CONFERENCE AND SAT FOR A CNN PRE-TAPED INTERVIEW,\nAND APPEARED IN TWO FUNDRAISERS INCLUDING THE ONE WHERE SHE MADE\nTHE DEPLORABLES COMMENT, AND WENT TO THE 9/11 CEREMONY.\n>> AND THE FACT IS THAT SHE CAN'T STOP LYING, AND IF THE\nTEAM SAYS, WELL, SHOULD WE SAY THAT YOU HAVE PNEUMONIA AND GET\nIT OUT THERE, AND ARE YOU FEELING WELL, AND I AM SURE THAT\nTHE ANSWER WAS NO. IT IS HER CHOICE TO HIDE IT.\nSHE WANTS TO SOLDIER ON AND OBVIOUSLY DOES NOT WANT TO STOP\nCAMPAIGNING OR FUND RAISING, BUT WHEN SHE COLLAPSED AND NEARLY\nCOLLAPSES AND SHE WOULD HAVE COLLAPSED IF SHE WAS NOT HELD UP\nAND THEN ARE PRETEND THAT IT IS OVERHEATING ON THE BEAUTIFUL\nSEPTEMBER DAY AND ADMITS THAT SHE WAS DIAGNOSED DAYS AGO, IT\nLOOKS LIKE SHE IS NEVER GOING TO TELL THE TRUTH.\n>> BOTH OF OF THE THINGS THE DEPLORABLES COMMENT AND THE\nTREATMENT OF THIS FIT INTO THE NARRATIVE AND I HATE THE WORD\nNARRATIVE, BUT IT FITS INTO THE HURRICANE KIND OF THE KEEPING\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN KEEPING THE REPORTERS AND THE PUBLIC IN THE\nDARK. >> AND REPORTERS HAPPILY GOING\nALONG WITH IT. AND TO A. B'S POINT, THEY SHOULD\nNOT LET HER KEEP A SCHEDULE LIKE THAT, AND PNEUMONIA AT ANY AGE\nIS LIKE 65,000 PEOPLE DIED LAST YEAR, AND SO YOU WOULD NOT LET A\nLOVED ONE KEEP A SCHEDULE LIKE THAT, AND PEOPLE GET IT AND SHE\nCOULD HAVE GOTTEN PAST IT, BUT THE PRESS REACTION AND DRUDGE\nGOT IT RIGHT AND NEW YORK TIMES WRONG, AND THE WASHINGTON POST\nWAS OPENLY ATTACKING PEOPLE ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT HER\nHEALTH. >> AND CHRIS CALIZZA SAYS THAT\nCOUGHING IS NOT A MAJOR EVENT, AND COUGHING, I WROTE, IS SIMPLY\nNOT EVIDENCE ENOUGH OF ANY SORT OF ANYTHING THAT COULD KEEP HER\nFROM BEING A CANDIDATE. >> AND WHEN YOU HEAR THE\nJOURNALISTS DISCOURAGING THE  TO THE JOURNALIST, BUT AN\nADVOCATE, AND THAT IS THE PRESS SAYING, STOP, STOP, YOU ARE\nHELPING TRUMP, AND BE QUIET, AND THEY ARE NOT JOURNALISTS ANYMORE\nWHEN THEY DO THAT. >> AND LISA, THERE IS DETAILED\nMEDICAL RECORDS, AND TRUMP IS GOING ON WITH DR. OZ THIS WEEK\nAND I DON'T KNOW HOW DETAILED WITH DR. OZ, BUT HE IS GOING ON\nTHERE. AND PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FORMER\nDOCTOR SAYS THAT BOTH CANDIDATES SHOULD PUT FORTH DETAILED\nMEDICAL RECORDS. >> AND IF DONALD TRUMP RELEASED\nTHE MEDICAL RECORDS THAT WOULD UP THE ANTE, AND BRETT, THE\nNARRATIVE IS THE PROBLEM FOR HURRICANE, BECAUSE MULTIPLE\nTHINGS TO POINT OUT IF YOU ARE THE DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND\nWHAT APPEARS LUKE IN THE FBI NOTES HER TALKING ABOUT THE\nCONCUSSION, AND THEN MENTIONING THAT SHE COULD NOT RECALL\nCERTAIN THINGS FROM THE BRIEFINGS, AND WHETHER IT IS THE\nCOUGHING FIT OR WHETHER SHE HAS U FALLEN BEFORE AND GOTTEN\nCONCUSSION, AND SO THIS IS PART OF THE NARRATIVE AND WHETHER IT\nIS REAL OR NOT, THE OPTICS DON'T LOOK GOOD FOR HER, AND THE\nSECOND PROBLEM FOR HURRICANE IS THE FACT THAT SHE IS NOW\nSTARTING ANOTHER POLITICAL WEEK ON THE DEFENSE.\nWHAT HAPPENS WITH HER NOT ATTENDING THE EVENT, AND THE\nJUXTAPOSITION OF DONALD TRUMP HITTING THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL\nAGGRESSIVELY AND HER NOT BEING OUT THERE IS NOT GOING TO BE\nLOOKING GOOD FOR HER AND IT IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO FEED THE\nNARRATIVE ABOUT HER HEALTH. >> YOU GOT IT IN THERE THREE\nTIMES. AND I DID NOT LIKE IT.\n>> ALL RIGHT. IN DEFENSE --\n>> I KNOW. I GOT IT.\nLUGH LAUGH IT IS SUNDAY NIGHT. AND MITT ROMNEY SAID THIS, BACK\nIN THE 2012 CAMPAIGN, AND NOW THERE ARE COMPARISONS.\n>> THERE ARE 47% OF THE PEOPLE WHO VOTE FOR THE PRESIDENT WHO\nARE WITH HIM, AND WHO BELIEVE BELIEVE THAT GOVERNMENT HAS A\nRESPONSIBILITY TO CARE FOR THEM AND WHO BELIEVES THAT THEY ARE\nENTITLED TO HEALTH CARE, TO FOOD, TO HOUSING AND TO YOU NAME\nIT. >> AND SOME PEOPLE SAID THAT WAS ACCURATE, AND OTHER PEOPLE SAID,\nTHIS IS REALLY WHAT CAUSED HIM TO LOSE.\nI PUT THIS UP, AND NOW THIS IS NONSCIENTIFIC AND THIS IS A\nTWITTER POLL, AND I POINT IT OUT, WHERE DOES HILLARY CLINTON\nTHE'S BASKET OF DEPLORABLES RANK POLITICALLY VERSUS MITT\nROMNEY'S, AND 25,000 PEOPLE VOTED AND IT IS 80% WORSE.\nIS IT, GUY? >> WELL, I THINK THAT THEY ARE\nCOMPARABLE AND IT IS NOT A GOOD THING FOR HER TO SAY.\nSHE HAS WALKED IT BACK BY APOLOGIZING BY DESCRIBING HALF\nOF TRUMP'S SUP POTTERS AS IRREDEEMABLE CITIZENS, OKAY,\nTRUE, AND IT WOULD NOT BE A CONVERSATION AND SHE SAID HALF.\n>> AND SORT OF SAID 47%. >> AND SO I THINK THAT IF I'M\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, I WOULD FUND RAISE OFF OF IT AN REMIND THE\nBASE OF IT REPEATEDLY, BUT FOR THE REST OF THE ELECTORATE, I AM\nPOINTING BACK THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN AND GRINDING DOWN THE\nNUMBERS FOR THREE WEEKS. >> AND THE MESSAGE IS I DON'T\nLIKE YOU AND I HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON.\nAND BY THE WAY, WHAT SHE SAID A YEAR AGO, YOU COULD HAVE LIKED\nAT THE RNC AND EVERYONE NODDED, AND A YEAR AGO, HER SENTIMENTS\nWOULD HAVE BEEN GREETED AS NONEXCEPTIONAL, AND THAT THE\nELITE OF NEW YORK AND LOS ANGELES AND EVERYBODY KNOWS IT\nIS TRUE. YOU LOOK OUT THERE IN THE BIG\nDARK SPACE, THOSE PEOPLE ARE BIGOTS, AND SO ARE YOU KIDDING?\nTHAT IS THE VIEW OF THE AMERICAN ELITES AGAINST THE AMERICAN\nPOPULATION AND THE REASON THAT TRUMP IS DOING WELL.\n>> WHERE IS THIS RACE RIGHT NOW? >> I THINK THAT THE RACE IS\nTIGHT. I DON'T SEE EITHER, AND\nOBVIOUSLY, THE UNFORESEEN CAN HAPPEN, AND ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN\nIN THE CYCLE, AND ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN AT THE LAST MINUTE, BUT\nIT IS A TIGHT RACE TO TEND. I DON'T SEE EITHER CANDIDATE\nGETTING A LEAD THE WAY THAT  TO LATE SUMMER, AN FOUGHT AND\nWON IN THE MARGINS. >> AND THE PRESS CYCLES, LISA,\nIT IS UNBELIEVABLE. IT IS SOMETHING ELSE.\n>> AND YES, TO TUCKER'S POINT, THE PROBLEM WITH MITT ROMNEY\nWITH THAT COMMENT IS THAT PEOPLE PERCEIVED HIM ADDS AN ELITIST,\nAND HILLARY CLINTON HAS THE SAME PROBLEM, AND WHEN YOU ARE\nLOOKING AT THE EXIT POLICIES OF THIS CANDIDATE CARE ABOUT ME,\nPRESIDENT OBAMA WON BY 18 TO 1 POINT MARGIN AND HILLARY CLINTON\nHAS THAT SAME PROBLEM, AND ONE, IT IS A STEW THE STUPID COMMENT\nAND SECONDLY THAT SHE IS A PERCEPTION OF ELITIST AND OUT OF\nTOUCH. >> WELL, I LIKE THAT PERCEPTION\nAND NOT NARRATIVE. >> AND COMING BACK, 9/11 AND\nWHAT WE HAVE LEARNED IN 15 YEARS AND I WILL SPEAK TO TWO MEN\nSERVING ON THE TOP CONGRESSIONAL",

SORT OF HAVE TO TAKE A STAND.\nBUT GIVEN WHAT YOU WENT THROUGH A YEAR AGO WHERE YOU WERE\nMISIDENTIFIED, THROWN TO THE GROUND, WHERE ARE YOU ON THESE\nPROTESTS? >> WELL, I AGREE WITH NATE THAT\nFIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU NATE FOR YOUR SERVICE.\nNEVER MENTIONED BEFORE THIS SO THANK YOU.\nBUT I DO BELIEVE THAT THEY FOUGHT FOR THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH\nPR FOR EVERYONE TO PROTEST IN THEIR OWN WAY AND TO PEACEFULLY\nPROTEST WHICH I THINK IS WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT COLIN'S PROTEST IS\nTHAT HE DID IT PEACEFULLY. AND I KNOW SOME FEEL LIKE IT'S\nDISRESPECTFUL BUT THAT'S UP TO THEM AND THAT'S UP TO THEM TO\nHAVE THEIR OPINION AND TO VOICE THAT OPINION.\nWHETHER YOU AGREE OR DISAGREE YOU CAN HAVE THE CONVERSATION\nWHICH I THINK COLIN KAEPERNICK DID START IS THIS CONVERSATION.\n>> YOU THINK THIS IS REALLY THAT IT'S WORKING FOR YOU TO WHO WAS\nA VICTIM OF POLICE EXCESSIVE FORCE YOU THINK THAT WHAT HE'S\nDOING IS GETTING ALL OF THIS STARTED IN THE COUNTRY?\n>> I DO BELIEVE IT'S A GREAT FIRST STEP.\nI ALSO APPLAUD COLIN FOR PUTTING HIS MONEY WHERE HIS MOUTH IS AND\nDONATING $1 MILLION TO A COMMUNITY, DONATING HIS JERSEY\nSALES PROFIT TO THIS BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THIS WAS SOMETHING\nTHAT WAS MOTIVATED BY DOLLARS AND CENTS, I THINK IT WAS HE SAW\nSOMETHING THAT HE DISAGREED WITH IN THE COUNTRY.\nSAW TREATMENT OF INDIVIDUALS LIKE HIMSELF AND OTHERS AND THEY\nDIDN'T HAVE A VOICE. SAME AS WHEN I HAD MY INCIDENT\nHAPPEN I KNOW THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE A\nVOICE, DON'T HAVE THE VOICE THAT I HAVE TO GET TO THE PRESS SO I\nTHINK HE WANTS TO SPEAK FOR THEM AND HE'S ACCOMPLISHED THAT.\nHE'S GOT US SPEAKING ABOUT IT STILL TODAY WEEKS AFTER HE DID\nTHIS FIRST. AND HE HAS A LOT OF NFL PLAYERS\nON HIS SIDE. >> NATE, WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO\nYOU THAT JERSEY SALES FOR COLIN KAEPERNICK SHOT UP AFTER THIS,\nAND WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE RATIO OF HOW MUCH WE'RE TALKING\nABOUT HOW HE IS ACTING, VERSUS WHAT HE'S ACTING ABOUT.\n>> YEAH, I THINK THERE IS DEFINITELY SUCH A FOCUS ON THE\nGESTURE ITSELF, MORE THAN THE MISSION BEHIND IT.\nAND I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU, JAMES, AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR\nSERVICE ON THE TENNIS COURT. I APPRECIATE WATCHING YOU.\nBUT SERIOUSLY, NO AND THE JERSEY SALES I THINK IT'S AMAZING WHAT\nHE'S DOING THAT HE'S STEPPING UP, AND HE'S PUTTING HIS MONEY\nWHERE HIS MOUTH IS JUST LIKE YOU SAID.\nAND I JUST HOPE THAT EVERY OTHER PLAYER THAT'S DOING THAT IS\nTAKING A STAND, IS ALL ABOUT THE ACTION BEHIND IT.\nYOU KNOW, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO NOW?\nYOU'RE PUTTING YOURSELF IN THAT SORT OF SPOTLIGHT, AND PEOPLE\nARE GOING TO EXPECT TO SEE ACTION, AND THE FACT THAT --\nWHEN I SAT DOWN WITH COLIN I HAD A COUPLE HOURS JUST ME AND HIM\nTALKING AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF\nGOOD POLICE OFFICERS THAT DO IT THE RIGHT WAY EVERY DAY.\nAND THESE ARE THE TYPE OF PEOPLE THAT WANT TO MOVE FORWARD TOO\nAND PROGRESS AND IMPROVE ON ALL THESE ISSUES, ESPECIALLY THE WAY\nTHAT A LOT OF THESE COMMUNITIES ARE, YOU KNOW,IBLE TER ACTING\nWITH THE POLICE. THERE ARE CERTAIN CITIES THAT\nARE DOING IT THE RIGHT WAY. I WAS FORTUNATE TO TALK TO THE\nCHIEF OF POLICE OF DALLAS YESTERDAY DAVID BROWN AND I MEAN\nTHAT GUY IF ANYBODY HAS A RIGHT TO KIND OF WEIGH IN ON THE\nISSUE, CONSIDERING HIS BACKGROUND, IS HIM.\nAND HE WANTS TO BE A PART OF THIS, TOO.\nHE WOULD LOVE TO SIT DOWN WITH A GROUP OF WHETHER IT'S ATHLETES\nOR AND POLICE OFFICERS PEOPLE FROM THE COMMUNITIES, AND JUST\nSORT OF HAVE A ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSION, AND I MEAN I WOULD\nLOVE TO BE A PART OF THAT, TOO. OBVIOUSLY JAMES YOU -- YOU'RE\nINVITED IF YOU WANT TO COME. >> I WOULD LOVE TO BE A PART OF\nTHAT. >> ANYKAY --\n>> THERE YOU GO. >> FOR --\n>> BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER AND HAVING THIS CONVERSATION, THAT'S\nALWAYS THE YOU KNOW SILVER LINING OF ANY OF THIS STUFF THAT\nHITS THE NEWS. SPEAKING OF TENNIS, BROUGHT IT\nUP YOU WERE AT THE U.S. OPEN LAST NIGHT.\nHOW'D THAT GO? >> WENT GREAT FOR STAN WARREN\nKA. I THINK HE'S ONE OF THE FEW\nPEOPLE IN THE WORLD THAT CAN HIT NOVAK DJOKOVIC OF THE COURT AND\nHE WAS ABLE TO DO THAT. GIVES HIM A CLEAR SENSE OF WHAT\nHE NEEDS TO DO. HE NEEDS TO PLAY ABSOLUTELY HUGE\nTENNIS. NOVAK FALTERED A LITTLE\nPHYSICALLY. HE DIDN'T HAVE MANY MATCHES\nCOMING INTO THIS -- INTO THIS FINAL.\nAND HIS FEET REALLY PAID THE PRICE.\nHE HAD SOME BLOOD BLISTERS AND THEY WERE PRETTY GNARLY.\nI SAW HEM IN THE LOCKER ROOM AFTERWARDS.\n>> NATE, JAMES, OH, WOW, I DIDN'T KNOW WE WERE GOING TO\nHAVE THESE FOOT B-ROLL. OKAY I NEEDED A WARNING FOR THE\nVIEWERS FOR THAT. GENTLEMEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nGREAT TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WITH BOTH OF YOU.\n>>LE. >> GOOD STUFF.\nTHAT'S NEXT STICK AROUND.",

YOU DID SEE RAISED FISTS DURING\nTHE ANTHEM LIKE THE KANSAS CITY CHIEFS MARCUS PETER TO SEAHAWKS\nLINKED ARM IN ARM. AN OBVIOUS DISPLAY OF UNITY.\nWE HAVE ANALYST AND SPORTS COLUMNIST FOR \"USA TODAY\"\nCHRISTINE BRENNAN AND WRITER FOR ESPNW AND ESPN MAGAZINE.\nCHRISTINE, WHAT ARE YOU HEARING AROUND THE LEAGUE ABOUT HOW THIS\nIS EVOLVING? WHAT PLAYERS ARE THINKING ABOUT.\n>> THE WORD YOU PICKED IS THE PERFECT WORD, EVOLVING.\nFOR ME WHAT I THINK WE SAW HAPPENING YESTERDAY WAS MAYBE A\nLITTLE BIT OF A STOP SIGN. LIKE WE WERE AT THE INTERSECTION\nAND EVERYONE KIND OF SAID, WHOA, IT'S 9/11.\nLET'S NOT HAVE A MASS PROTEST HERE.\nLET'S BE RESPECTFUL. WE SAW THAT AS YOU POINTED OUT\nOVER AND OVER AGAIN. THERE WERE VERY FEW INDIVIDUAL\nPROTESTS. AND INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS.\nSIGNS OF DISOOOBEADANCE OR ANY KIND OF PROTEST 9/11.\nWHAT I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE AS A CONTINUATION OF IT NEXT\nWEEK MOVING FORWARD. IT'S NOT JUST THE NFL, WE SAW IT\nIN HIGH SCHOOL, COLLEGE, ET CETERA.\nI THINK IT WILL BEGIN IN EARNEST, AGAIN, WHATEVER THAT\nMEANS EXACTLY THE NUMBERS I HAVE NO IDEA.\nBUT I THINK 9/11 WAS A MOMENT FOR MANY PEOPLE TO PAUSE, WHICH\nIS WHY WE SAW THE LINKED ARMS VERSUS INDIVIDUALS DOING THINGS\nAND I THINK WE'LL SEE MUCH MORE NEXT WEEK AND I ALSO BELIEVE THE\nNFL HAS DONE A VERY GOOD JOB SO FAR OF THREADING THE NEEDLE OF\nSAYING WE PREFER, WE ASKED OUR ATHLETES TO STAND, BUT WE ALSO\nUNDERSTAND AND RESPECT AS ALL OF US, OF COURSE, UNDERSTAND THAT\nTO RESPECT THE RIGHTS OF ANY INDIVIDUAL IN THE UNITED STATES\nTO DO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. THE NFL I THINK HAS HANDLED THIS\nCORRECTLY, AT LEAST SO FAR. >> HOW DO YOU SEE IT?\nTHE LINKED ARMS AND A RAISED FIST.\nDO YOU THINK THIS IS A TREND THAT WE WILL SEE GROW ABOUT\nPERSONAL STATEMENTS OR WAS THIS 9/11?\n>> I THINK THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY A TREND.\nWHEN KAEPERNICK FIRST CAME OUT AND DID HIS DEMONSTRATION A LOT\nOF PEOPLE CRITICIZED THE MEANS AND THE METHODS AND A LOT OF\nPEOPLE SAID IT WAS DISRESPECTFUL OR FLAT OUT NOT GOING TO BE\nEFFECTIVE. HE HAS PROVEN PEOPLE WRONG\nBECAUSE, OBVIOUSLY, IT IS SPREADING AND THE FACT THAT\nWE'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT THIS WEEKS LATER MEANS IT IS\nEFFECTIVE AND HIS MESSAGE IS STARTING TO GET ACROSS.\n>> HERE'S THE DISTINCTION WHEN YOU WEAR THE RIBBON OF A CERTAIN\nCOLOR OR BREAST CANCER AWARENESS, IT IS AWARENESS.\nPEOPLE AREN'T AWARE OF WHAT A BIG KILLER IT IS, IT RAISES\nAWARENESS. THIS IS DIFFERENT, CHRISTINE,\nBECAUSE EVERYBODY IN THIS COUNTRY SHOULD KNOW WHAT THEY'RE\nPROTESTING WHEN THEY'RE PROTESTING.\nTHIS IS NOT A SECRET. SO, THE QUESTION BECOMES THEY\nCAN LINK ARMS AND PUT UP A FIST AND WHATEVER, IS THIS A MEANS\nTOWARDS HAVING THE DISCUSSION, A MEANINGFUL DISCUSSION THAT THESE\nTYPES OF PROTESTS SUGGEST OR DO YOU THINK THAT'S BEYOND THE\nREACH OF THESE PLAYERS IN THIS LEAGUE?\n>> I DON'T THINK ANYTHING IS BEYOND THE REACH OF THE PLAYERS\nIN THE LEAGUE. WHETHER WE AGREE OR DISAGREE\nWITH WHAT THE ATHLETES ARE DOING, I THINK THE FACT IS THEY\nCAN DO IT, OF COURSE, IS A WONDERFUL, FABULOUS THING THAT\nPART OF OUR COUNTRY. AND I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED AND\nYOU GUYS WE TALKED ABOUT THIS A LOT, ISSUES THAT ARE IN OUR\nCULTURE THAT SPORTS TAKES US TO DIFFERENT KIND OF CONVERSATIONS\nAND REACHES DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND WHETHER IT WAS THE HORRORS AT\nPENN STATE WITH JERRY SANDUSKY OR THE RAY RICE VIDEO TWO YEARS\nAGO AND THE PUNCH AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ON THE POWER OF ROLE\nMODELS AND CONCUSSIONS WITH OUR KIDS, NOT JUST WITH OUR TOP\nPROFESSIONAL ATHLETES. ALL THESE THINGS ARE SO\nIMPORTANT. I BELIEVE ANY CONVERSATION IS A\nGREAT CONVERSATION. IF SPORTS TAKES US AND ENABLES\nTHAT CONVERSATION EVEN MORE, THEN I THINK THAT'S ALL FOR THE\nGOOD, FOR NOT ONLY IN SPORTS AND FOR THESE ATHLETES AND\nINDIVIDUALS AND FOR JOURNALISM, BUT ALSO FOR THE COUNTRY AT\nLARGE. >> SOMETHING UNSETTLING HAPPENED\nAT THE GAMES. THIS IS ON 9/11.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA PRERECORDED A MESSAGE ABOUT WHERE WE ARE ON\n9/11 AND IT WAS BOOED AT SOME STADIUMS.\n>> IT WAS A FAIRLY STANDARD, VANILLA STATEMENT FOR THE\nPRESIDENT ADDRESSING 9/11 AT A FOOTBALL GAME.\nWE ALSO HAD GEORGE W. BUSH COME OUT AND DO A COIN TOSS AND HE\nWASN'T BOOED, WHICH I THINK IS INTERESTING, CONSIDERING THAT A\nLOT OF THESE ISSUES HAVE TO DO WITH RESPECT FOR THE MILITARY.\n>> IS IT BECAUSE OF WHERE -- WAS THIS A PARTICULAR STADIUM WHERE\nPRESIDENT OBAMA WAS BOOED? WERE THESE FEISTY FANS OR\nSOMETHING MORE? >> SPORTS FANS WILL TAKE ANY\nOPPORTUNITY TO BOO, SO, THERE'S ABSOLUTELY THAT.\nI BELIEVED HE WAS BOOED IN BALTIMORE.\nBUT AT THE SAME TIME I THINK JUST AT THIS POINT THE NFL HAS\nSUCH ITS OWN CREATED PATRIOTISM THAT NFL FANS TAKE A PRIDE IN\nSTANDING OUT AGAINST THINGS THAT THEY PERCEIVE TO BE RUBBING UP\nAGAINST THAT. SO, I THINK THAT'S REALLY WHAT\nTHAT WAS ABOUT. I DIDN'T REALLY LIKE THE\nPRESIDENT'S STATEMENT WAS BOOED. >> NEW YORK, BALTIMORE, PHILLY,\nYOU TEND TO GET A BIGGER BOO INDEX IN THOSE BIGGER CITIES.\nNICE TO SEE IF THE PLAYERS TAKE THE NEXT STEP AND TALK ABOUT WHY\nTHEY'RE PROTESTING HIM AND WHAT THESE ISSUES ARE AND WHAT THEY\nMEAN TO THEM.

SHE WAS SCHEDULED TO LEAVE THIS\nMORNING. THIS CAPPED THE DAY OF SCRUTINY\nFOR THE NOMINEE AFTER QUESTIONS RAISED WHEN A VIDEO EMERGED\nSHOWING HER STUMBLING WITH SECRET SERVICE AGENTS HELPING\nHER INTO THE VAN LEAVING THE 9/11 CEREMONY EARLY.\nTHE CAMPAIGN HAD EARLIER SAID SHE LEFT THE EVENT AFTER\nBECOMING OVERHEATED. CLINTON WENT TO HER DAUGHTER'S\nAPARTMENT IN NEW YORK. WHEN LEAVING, THERE SHE SAID SHE\nWAS FEELING GREAT. THE CAMPAIGN TOLD US MRS.\nCLINTON WAS LATER EXAMINED AT HER HOME IN CHAPPAQUA.\nSHE WAS OVERHEATED AND DEHYDRATED AND THE CAMPAIGN\nREVEALED ON SUNDAY THAT ON FRIDAY SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH\nPNEUMONIA AND PUT ON ANTIBIOTICS AND ADVISED TO CUT BACK HER\nSCHEDULE. THE CAMPAIGN DID NOT REVEAL WHY\nTHEY DID NOT DISCUSS THE DIAGNOSIS.\nSHE HAD A MEETING WITH A BIPARTISAN GROUP OF NATIONAL\nSECURITY EXPERTS AND DID AN INTERVIEW WITH CNN'S CHRIS CUOMO\nAND DID A FUND-RAISER. WE DON'T KNOW WHY SHE DID NOT\nSTART CUTTING BACK AFTER THE DIAGNOSIS OTHER THAN THIS IS A\nPRESIDENTIAL RACE AND KNOWING HAVING BEEN COVERING HER FOR A\nLONG TIME, SHE HAS A TENDENCY TO KEEP GOING.\nNOW THE CAMPAIGN HAS QUESTIONS TO ANSWER AS HER HEALTH IS A BIG\nISSUE. >> THIS IS A MAJOR CAMPAIGN\nISSUE. LET'S BRING IN EUGENE SCOTT.\nI WANT TO READ TO YOU WHAT HER DOCTOR HAS SAID.\nWE KNOW THE DIAGNOSIS OF PNEUMONIA HAPPENED ON FRIDAY AND\nTHE STUMBLE HAPPENED ON SUNDAY. SHE WAS PLANNING TO GO TO\nCALIFORNIA AS RECENTLY AS LAST EVENING.\nNOW THAT HAS BEEN CANCELED. THIS IS WHAT HER PERSONAL DOCTOR\nSAID. SECRETARY CLINTON HAS BEEN\nEXPERIENCING A COUGH RELATED TO ALLE\nALLERGIES. ON FRIDAY, AFTER FOLLOW-UP FOR\nHER PROLONGED COUGH, SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA.\nWHILE AT THE EVENT, SHE WAS OVERHEATED AND DEHYDRATED.\nI EXAMINED HER AND SHE IS REHYDRATED AND RECOVERING\nNICELY. YOU KNOW PNEUMONIA CAN BE\nSERIOUS. YOU LOOK AT THE MEDICAL\nGUIDELINES FOR INFANTS OR ANYONE OVER 65, IT CAN BE SERIOUS.\nSHE IS OVER 65. THE ISSUE IS NOT NECESSARILY\nPNEUMONIA, BUT NO ONE KNEW ABOUT IT AND WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN\nABOUT IT IF SHE HADN'T STUMBLED OR CAUGHT STUMBLING ON CAMERA.\nIS THIS A HEALTH ISSUE OR TRANSPARENCY ISSUE OR BOTH?\n>> IT IS PROBABLY BOTH. THE REALITY IS WE WOULD FIND OUT\nABOUT IT REGARDLESS. THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY\nTHE CAMPAIGN DID NOT MAKE IT PUBLIC ON FRIDAY.\nESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THIS HAS BEEN AN ONGOING ISSUE OR\nCRITICISM OF CLINTON THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN.\nWHAT THEY WILL DO FROM THIS POINT FORWARD IN TERMS OF TRYING\nTO CLARIFY FOR VOTERS FOR HER HEALTH IS WORTH PAYING ATTENTION\nTO AND HOW THE DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN RESPONDS.\n>> NEITHER CAMPAIGN HAS RELEASED INFORMATION ABOUT MEDICAL\nINFORMATION. DONALD TRUMP'S DOCTOR RELEASED A\nSTATEMENT HE PUT TOGETHER INTO FIVE MINUTES.\nHIS BLOOD PRESSURE AND LAB RESULTS EXCELLENT.\nIF ELECTED, MR. DONALD TRUMP, I CAN SAY WILL BE THE HEALTHIEST\nINDIVIDUAL EVER ELECTED TO THE PRESIDENCY.\nTHAT IS NOT A HEALTH DISCLOSURE. HILLARY CLINTON PUT OUT A\nTWO-PAGE LETTER OFFERING MORE INFORMATION.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS NOT RELEASED HIS TAXES.\nTRANSPARENCY IS NOT A BIG PART OF THE CAMPAIGN.\nEUGENE, THE TRANSPARENCY ISSUES ASIDE, TRUMP ALLIES, UP UNTIL\nTHIS POINT, HAD BEEN QUESTIONING HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH AND HAD\nBEEN QUESTIONING HER STAMINA A LOT.\nSOME SAY AGGRESSIVELY OR OVERAGGRESSIVELY.\nTHE LAST FEW HOURS, ASTONISHINGLY QUIET.\n>> I THINK IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT TRUMP HAS BEEN QUIET FOLLOWING\nTHIS SITUATION AND THE CAMPAIGN SUPPOSEDLY TOLD SURROGATES AND\nSUPPORTERS NOT TO COMMENT ON THIS PUBLICLY AND THERE WAS ALSO\nSOMEONE CLOSELY FAMILIAR WITH THE CAMPAIGN WHO SAID THERE WERE\nPERHAPS THREATS IF YOU DID COMMENT ON THIS, THERE COULD BE\nPOSSIBLE TERMINATION. THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WANTS TO BE\nRESPECTFUL AND WISH HER A HEALTHY RECOVERY.\n>> THE STORY ALLOWS IT TO BE ON HILLARY CLINTON AND ALLOWS THE\nSTORY LINE TO PLAY OUT. THIS STORY LINE ON FRIDAY,\nHILLARY CLINTON CALLED HALF OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS DEPLORABLES.\nIF WE HAVE THAT SOUND. LET'S PLAY THAT SOUND FROM\nFRIDAY. >> TO JUST BE GROSSLY\nGENERALISTIC, YOU COULD PUT HALF OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS INTO WHAT I\nCALL THE BASKET OF DEPLORABLES. RIGHT?\nTHE RACIST, SEXIST, HOMOPHOBIC, XENOPHOBIC, ISLAMAPHOBIC.\nYOU NAME IT. >> WE KNOW THAT IS THE DAY SHE\nWAS DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA. SHE ISSUED A STATEMENT LATER\nSAYING THAT SHE WAS GROSSLY GEN\nGENERALISTIC AND SHE REGRETS AS TALKING ABOUT DEPLORABLES AS THE\nCAMP OF SUPPORTERS AND THE LEFT BEHINDS THAT DESERVE EMPATHY.\nDONALD TRUMP NOT COMMENTING ON HER HEALTH.\nHE DID COMMENT ON THIS. IT SHOWS SHE MISJUDGES HIS\nSUPPORTERS. >> RIGHT.\nI SAW A COUPLE DIFFERENT RESPONSES.\nONE CAME OUT AND SAID SHE WAS WRONG AND COMPARE THAT TO HOW\nLONG DONALD TRUMP TO ADMIT HE IS WRONG, IF EVER, WHEN HE IS\nCRITICIZED. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO MADE IT\nCLEAR THAT THE WORDS WERE NOT CHARITIABLE AND NOT SYMPATHETIC\nTO PEOPLE VOTING FOR DONALD TRUMP OR INDEPENDENTS\nCONSIDERING DONALD TRUMP. >> SHE SAID THE DEPLORABLES ON\nTHE STUMP BEFORE. THIS WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME.\n>> ONE THING ABOUT THE PNEUMONIA.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS AND THE TAXES TOO.\nNO ONE IS SAYING PNEUMONIA IS DISQUALIFYING.\nPEOPLE GET SICK. WE'VE HAD PNEUMONIA AND WE'VE\nGOTTEN BETTER. >> WE HAVE SEEN OFFICIALS\nSTUMBLE DOWN STAIRS. >> LET VOTERS KNOW ABOUT TO TAKE\nIT INTO CONSIDERATION. LIKEWISE, TAX RETURNS.\nTHERE MAY BE NOTHING IN THE TAX RETURNS FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nIT MAY SHOW HE IS WICKED RICH. SHOW IT.\nLET VOTERS DECIDE. ONE REASON DONALD TRUMP MAY BE\nBEING QUIET RIGHT NOW. IF YOU ARE GETTING INTO AN\nARGUMENT OF TRANSPARENCY, IT MAY BE ONE WHERE HE IS NOT ALWAYS\nWINNING. >> THE ABSENCE OF TRANSPARENCY\nIN THE CAMPAIGN IN DIFFERENT WAYS.\nMOVING FORWARD, IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF THERE ARE\nSIGNIFICANT CHANGES. IT SEEMS IT IS A DIFFICULT\nTHING. YOU END UP SHARING THINGS AS\nRUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN, YOU WOULD NOT\nSHARE WITH YOUR FRIENDS. IT BECOMES DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE.\n>> BEFORE THIS, FOR THE PAST FEW WEEKS, I HAVE BEEN WATCHING\nCANDIDATES. IT IS REMARKABLE THE STAMINA YOU\nHAVE TO HAVE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.\nYOU THINK OF THE EVENTS THEY ARE DOING EVERY DAY.\nYOU THINK OF HOW MANY TIMES YOU ARE IN AND OUT OF AN AIRPLANE\nAND HOW MANY HANDS THEY SHAKE AND HOW MANY HOT HALLWAYS YOU\nHAVE TO STAND IN BEFORE BEING ON.\n>> FRIDAY, HILLARY CLINTON DID ALL THOSE THINGS AND SHE HAS\nPNEUMONIA. IT GOES TO SHOW SHE CAN FIGHT\nTHROUGH IT. >> YOU ARE EXPECTED TO BE.\nWHEN YOU ARE RUNNING THE FREE WORLD.\n>> LAST TWO DAYS OF THE CAMPAIGN, NOT GOOD.\n>> HAVE YOU SEEN WHAT SHE WILL MISS?\nAN INTERVIEW ON \"ELLEN\" AND FUND-RAISER WITH KATY AND DIANE\nVON FIRSTENBERG'S. >> EUGENE SCOTT, GREAT TO HAVE\nYOU WITH US.",

HER EVENTS WERE PACKED WITH A\nMEETING WITH A BIPARTISAN GROUP AND NATIONAL SECURITY EXPERTS.\nSHE DID AN INTERVIEW WITH CNN'S CHRIS CUOMO.\nSHE DID A FUND-RAISER AND WE DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER TO WHY SHE\nDID NOT CUT BACK GIVEN THE DIAGNOSIS.\nOTHER THAN THIS IS A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN AND CLOSE\nRACE AND HAVING COVERED HER FOR A COUPLE OF DECADES, SHE HAS A\nTENDENCY TO KEEP GOING NO MATTER WHAT.\nNOW THE CAMPAIGN HAS MORE QUESTIONS TO ANSWER AS HER\nHEALTH HAS BECOME A MAJOR CAMPAIGN ISSUE.\nJOHN AND CHRISTINE. >> TRANSPARENCY IS AN ISSUE.\nTHEY KNEW FRIDAY. SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH FRIDAY.\nTHEY TOLD THE WORLD ON SUNDAY SHE HAD IT.\nTHE QUESTION IS WOULD THEY HAVE TOLD US AT ALL HAD SHE NOT\nSTUMBLED. ONE PERSON WE HAVE NOT HEARD\nFROM ON THIS SUBJECT, DONALD TRUMP.\nHE HAS NOT UTTERED A WORD ABOUT CLINTON'S HEALTH.\nSOURCES IN THE CAMPAIGN SAY THEY WANT TO BE RESPECTFUL AND\nSTAFFERS HAVE BEEN ORDERED NOT TO POST ANYTHING NEGATIVE ON\nSOCIAL MEDIA. THE CAMPAIGN WANTS TO GET THIS\nOUT THAT ANY VIOLATION OF THE ORDER COULD BE GROUNDS FOR\nTERMINATION. LET'S GET THE LATEST FROM SCOTT\nMcLEAN IN WASHINGTON. >> Reporter: WHAT HE DID DO WAS\nATTEND A MEMORIAL CEREMONY FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE ATTACK AT\nGROUND ZERO IN THE MORNING. HE WAS THERE WITH FORMER MAYOR\nRUDY GIULIANI AND NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR CHRISTIE.\nHE VISITED A NEW YORK FIREHOUSE AFTERWARDS.\nAS HE WAS LEAVING, HE WAS ASKED ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH.\nHE DID NOT HAVE MUCH TO SAY. LISTEN.\n>> A QUICK QUESTION ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH\nINCIDENT THIS MORNING. >> Reporter: TRUMP PUT OUT A\nWRITTEN STATEMENT THAT READ IN PART, OUR SOLEMN DUTY ON BEHALF\nOF THOSE WHO PERISHED 15 YEARS AGO IS TO KEEP ALL OUR PEOPLE\nSAFE FROM AN ENEMY THAT SEEKS NOTHING LEFT THAN TO DESTROY OUR\nWAY OF LIFE. TRUMP WILL RESUME CAMPAIGNING AS\nFOUR NEW NBC NEWS/MARIST POLLS SHOW IN THE STATE OF ARIZONA AND\nGEORGIA AND IN BATTLE GROUND STATES NECK AND NECK.\nTRUMP WILL START HIS DAY IN BALTIMORE WITH THE SPEECH TO THE\nNATIONAL GUARD ASSOCIATION BEFORE HEADING TO ASHEVILLE,\nNORTH CAROLINA FOR A CAMPAIGN RALLY.\nJOHN AND CHRISTINE.",

SHE WAS ONE OF NEW YORK'S\nSENATORS DURING 9/11. AN IMPORTANT 15th ANNIVERSARY\nOCCASION. SHE ALSO KNEW DONALD TRUMP WOULD\nBE THERE.

THERE ARE OUTRAGEOUS CONSPIRACY\nTHEORIES SUGGESTING CLINTON IS DYING AND ON DEATH'S DOOR.\nNO EVIDENCE OF THAT.

THOSE QUESTIONS ABOUT HER\nSTAMINA ARE GIVEN MORE LEGITIMACY BY THIS ISSUE TODAY\nWITH HER HEALTH. THERE'S THE NONSENSE ON ONE\nHAND, ON RIGHT WING WEBSITES, BUT THEN LEGITIMATE QUESTIONS,\nLEGITIMATE CONCERNS THAT REPORTERS NEED TO SPEND MORE\nTIME DIGGING INTO.

I WOULD PUT A COUPLE CAVEATS ON\nIT. A REASON I FIND 9/11 SUCH A SAD\nDAY IS NOT ONLY ALL THE AMERICAN WHO IS WERE KILLED AND OTHERS,\nIT'S THE FACT, IT'S LIKE \"D\" DAY OR PEARL HARBOR DAY IN OUR\nMEMORY. PEARL HARBOR PRESSED A GIANT WAR\nIN THE PACIFIC WHERE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WERE KILLED, IT HAD A\nHAPPY ENDING. A MORE DEMOCRATIC JAPAN AND\nSTABLE EUROPE. 9/11 PRODUCED NONE OF THAT.\n9/11, REALLY HAS -- THE ONLY REAL TRANSFORMATION IN THE\nMIDDLE EAST IS THAT WE COULD CHANGE GERMANY, WE COULD CHANGE\nJAPAN BECAUSE THEY WERE STATES. AL QAEDA, THEY ARE NOT STATES.\nTHESE ARE MOVEMENTS.

WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION?\nWHEN YOU SAW IT, DID YOU THINK TO YOURSELF, THIS IS AL QAEDA?\n>> FAREED, I WAS IN NEW YORK TEACHING A COURSE ON AMERICAN\nFOREIGN POLICY IN THE MIDDLE EAST.\nTHEY SAID IS THIS THE BEGINNING OF WORLD WAR III?\nTHERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF CONFUSION, ANXIETY, FEAR.\nFEW AMERICANS KNEW ABOUT AL QAEDA.\nSOME OF US DID NOT TAKE IT SERIOUSLY, FAREED.\nWE ESTIMATED AND BASICALLY THOUGHT AL QAEDA WAS A VERY\nSMALL ORGANIZATION. IT DID NOT HAVE LARGE NUMBERS.\nTHIS PARTICULAR SENSE, I WAS SURPRISED THAT IT WAS ABLE TO\nCARRY OUT SUCH A SPECTACULAR NUMBER OF ATTACKS IN THE HEART\nOF AMERICA. >> MARY, WHAT WAS YOUR THOUGHT\nABOUT WHAT THIS MEANT?

I THINK NO ONE HAD CONCEIVED\nSUCH AN ATTACK COULD BE EXECUTED IN THE WAY IT WAS.\nI THINK THERE WAS AN APPRECIATION THE WORLD CHANGED.\nTHERE WAS A SOLIDARITY AT THAT MOMENT.\nREMEMBER THE FRENCH AND THE BIG HEADLINES WERE ALL AMERICANS\nNOW. IN THE YEARS AFTER THAT, MANY OF\nTHE COUNTRIES FORGOT THAT LESSON, WE FORGOT THAT LESSON IN\nTHE UNITED STATES. THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT, WE ARE\nSTARTING TO SEE TODAY. WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT IN A\nMOMENT. >> TOM FRIEDMAN, YOU WERE IN TEL\nAVIV, CORRECT? >> I WAS IN TEL AVIV COVERING\nTHE PALESTINIAN CONFLICT. I WAS IN THE OFFICE OF THE\nPRESIDENT OF TEL AVIV UNIVERSITY INTERVIEWING HIM WHEN THE NEWS\nFLASHED ON THE TELEVISION. THAT NIGHT, THEY CLOSED THE ROAD\nAND I WAS TRAPPED THERE. I HAPPENED TO KNOW THE CHIEF OF\nMILITARY INTELLIGENCE AND I CONTACTED THEM AND SAID I NEED\nTO KNOW EVERYTHING YOU KNOW ABOUT SUICIDE BOMBING.\nHE WANTED TO TALK TO ME AS WELL. WE MET THE NEXT MORNING AT 7:00\nA.M. WITH THE WHOLE TEAM. I GOT AN INSIGHT FROM THAT\nDIALOGUE THAT STAYED WITH ME THROUGH TODAY AND GOVERNED HOW I\nLOOK AT THIS PROBLEM. WHEN I ASKED WHAT THEY LEARNED\nFROM THE SUICIDE BOMBING, THE BASIC MESSAGE WAS OUR\nINTELLIGENCE IS GOOD, WE HAVE THE WEST BANK WIRED.\nWE CAN GET THEM BEFORE THEY BLOW UP A PIZZA PARLOR OR A DISCO\nCLUB. THEY WILL GET THROUGH UNLESS THE\nVILLAGE SAYS KNOW. IT TAKES A VILLAGE.\nIF THE VILLAGE SAYS THIS IS MARTYRDOM, NOT MURDER, IT WILL\nCONTINUE. IF THEY SAY IT'S MURDER, IT WILL\nSTOP. IT'S TRUE THEN AND JUST AS TRUE\nTODAY. >> WHEN YOU WERE IN THE STATE\nDEPARTMENT, HOW DID YOU TACKLE THE PROBLEM TOM FRIEDMAN IS\nTALKING ABOUT, WHICH IS ULTIMATELY THE ONLY WAY THIS IS\nGOING TO STOP IS IF YOU SOMEHOW GET THE ATMOSPHERE IN SOME OF\nTHESE ARAB COUNTRIES TO BE NOT JUST LESS PERMISSIVE, BUT DEEPLY\nCONDEMNATORY. SAUDI ARABIA DOES NOT WINK AND\nNOD AT JIHADIS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT DOING IT IN SAUDI ARABIA.\nAS LONG AS THEY DO IT SOMEWHERE ELSE IT'S OKAY.\nTHAT'S A TOUGH PROBLEM FOR FOREIGN POLICY TO SOLVE.\n>> RIGHT. WE ADDRESSED IT AT THE MACRO\nLEVEL WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA EELS NEW BEGINNING WITH THE MUSLIM\nWORLD, WHICH WAS FOLLOWING IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF CONDI RICE'S\nPROCLAMATION THERE HAS TO BE A ROBUST, CIVIL SOCIETY IN ARAB\nSOCIETY AND THAT MEANS ARAB GOVERNMENTS LOOSENING UP.\nTHAT'S A CONFLICT BETWEEN THOSE GOVERNMENTS WE SUPPORT.\nWE ATTEMPTED TO SAY WE NEED TO TALK TO ISLAMIC GROUPS IN THESE\nSOCIETIES EVEN WHEN THEIR GOVERNMENTS DON'T LIKE IT.\nSTRENGTHEN WAYS THEY HAVE CONNECTION TO ISLAMIC EXTREMISM.\nTHAT WAS BEFORE THE ARAB SPRING, THEN CAME THE ARAB SPRING.\nWE TRIED TO SUPPORT THAT. IT'S LIKE THE FRENCH REVOLUTION,\nIT TAKES DECADES TO MAKE THAT CHANGE.\n>> VERY MESSY. >> ABSOLUTELY.\nWE HAD TO BE WORKING WITH THOSE GOVERNMENTS, KNOWING THOSE\nGOVERNMENTS ARE NOT ONLY REPRESSING THEIR OWN PEOPLE IN\nWAYS THAT CREATE SUPPORT, BUT ALSO, SOMETIMES, WORKING WITH\nTHOSE GROUPS IN WAYS WE DON'T LIKE.\nIT'S VERY HARD TO TAKE ONE POSITION OR ANOTHER.\nTOM IS RIGHT. IN THE END, YOU HAVE TO\nPENETRATE THE SOCIETY, NOT THE GOVERNMENT.\nTHAT'S VERY HARD FOR ANOTHER GOVERNMENT TO DO.\n>> FAWAZ, WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME, BUT QUICKLY, WOULD YOU SAY\nTHERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO FEEL THE U.S. RESPONSE VERY\nQUICKLY BECAME TOO MILITARY AND YET THESE WERE VERY BAD GUYS.\nDO YOU THINK THAT THERE WAS ANY -- WAS IT NOT INEVITABLE THERE\nWOULD BE A VERY STRONG MILITARY RESPONSE?\n>> YOU KNOW, FAREED, I WISH WE HAD MORE TIME.\nI WILL TRY TO BE PRECISE. OFTEN THE QUESTION IS ASKED, DID\n9/11 CHANGE THE WORLD? I ARGUE THAT A MORE PERTINENT\nQUESTION, TO WHAT EXTENT DID 9/11 TRANSFORM AMERICA?\nIN THE SENSE OF SHATTERING AMERICA'S INNOCENCE, NOT ONLY\nABOUT SECURITY, BUT ABOUT THE WORLD, GIVEN RISE TO\nINTERVENTIONIST AND CREW SAIDING IMPULSES.\nINVOLVING THE UNITED STATES IN WARS AND DISTANT PLANS.\nDONALD TRUMP IN HIS INCOHERENT WAY TALKING ABOUT THE FOUNDERS\nOF ISIS.

I WANT TO PLAY YOU A PORTION OF\nTHAT. >> I THINK THAT IF THERE ARE\nWAYS TO DO BUSINESS WITH RUSSIA WE SHOULD ALWAYS BE OPEN.\nTHAT'S WHAT THE RESET ACCOMPLISHED.\nWE STAND BY OUR FRIENDS AND ALLIES.\nWE'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH ANYBODY, INCLUDING OF COURSE\nPUTIN. I'VE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH\nPUTIN. BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT BY\nJUST ROLLING OVER AND ADOPTING HIS WISH LIST WHICH IS EXACTLY\nWHAT DONALD TRUMP HAS DONE. >> ALL RIGHT THAT IS NOT THE\nSOUND BITE THAT I WAS HOPING FOR.\nI WANTED TO TELL YOU WHAT SHE WAS SAYING ABOUT ISIS.\nLET ME QUICKLY REDO THAT. SHE SAID IT'S TIME FOR A CANDID,\nHONEST CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT WE FACE BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST\nISIS. I THINK IT'S INTENSE FEIGING OUR\nEFFORTS AGAINST ISIS COULD LEAD TO THEIR DEFEAT.\nIT'S VIOLENT JIHADISM. IT'S TIME TO SAY WE'RE NOT GOING\nTO BE ABLE TO WIPE OUT ISIS OVERNIGHT.\nIT'S NOT GOING TO BE A BOMBING CAMPAIGN THAT WORKS?\n>> I DON'T THINK IT'S MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.\nWE NEED A MILITARY STRATEGY. WE HAVEN'T HAD ONE IN FOUR\nYEARS, TO DEAL WITH ISIS AT ITS CORE AND THAT'S THE ISLAMIC\nSTATE. BUT I THINK I AGREE WITH HER IN\nA SENSE THAT THE POLITICAL DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION IS IMPORTANT\nBUT THE COUNTERNARRATIVE TO THE IDEOLOGY.\nTHIS IS A LONG-TERM GENERATIONAL STRUGGLE, NOT UNLIKE WHAT WE HAD\nWITH COMMUNISM. WE ARE GOING AGAINST AN IDEOLOGY\nWHEN WE HAD COMMUNISM RAGING, PRESIDENT KENNEDY CALLED IT A\nLONG, TWILIGHT STRUGGLE. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE FACING TODAY.\nI THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT.\nIT'S NOT GOING TO GO AWAY TOMORROW.\nIT IS GOING TO BE A GENERATIONAL FIGHT, AND IT'S ONE THAT'S OVER\nIDEAS THAT DRONE STRIKES ALONE CANNOT KILL.\n>> OKAY. NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT VLADIMIR\nPUTIN, YOU HAD A CONVERSATION WITH DONALD TRUMP RECENTLY,\nMAYBE EVEN A COUPLE DAYS AGO, ABOUT VLADIMIR PUTIN.\nWHAT DID HE SAY? >> WELL, I WAS WITH HIM AT THE\n9/11 MEMORIAL SERVICE, VERY MOVING CEREMONY, BOTH\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES WERE THERE.\nI THINK WE ALL ADVISED CAUTION WITH MR. PUTIN.\nMR. PUTIN IS NOT OUR FRIEND. DOESN'T ALWAYS HAVE OUR BEST\nINTERESTS AT -- >> WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP BEING COMPLIMENTARY OF HIM AND SAYING THAT HE'S A\nSTRONG LEADER, STRONGER THAN OUR PRESIDENT?\n>> I THINK WHAT HE'S EXPRESSING IN HIS WAY IS THAT HE HAS\nRESPECT FOR THE MAN. BECAUSE OF HIS STRENGTH.\nI THINK MR. TRUMP THIS HE HAS STRENGTH AS WELL, AND IS IN THE\nBEST POSITION TO SIT DOWN IN THE ROOM, AND STARE HIM DOWN, IF YOU\nWILL, PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH IS IMPORTANT HERE.\nI THINK AS SECRETARY CLINTON MENTIONED WE CAN'T JUST LAY DOWN\nAND LET HIM GET WHAT HE WANTS. HIS INTEREST IN THE REGION ARE\nVERY DIFFERENT FROM OUR INTERESTS.\nTHE ONE THING WE SHARE IN COMMON IS OUR FIGHT AGAINST ISIS.\n>> BUT ARE YOU COMFORTABLE WITH THE SOMEWHAT FLATTERING TONE OF\nSTRENGTH FOR A DICTATOR. >> LOOK, THAT'S HIS STYLE.\nTAKE PERSONALITIES OFF THE TABLE, OUR MILITARY IS THE\nWEAKEST IT'S BEEN SINCE WORLD WAR II.\nAND I THINK HE WILL STRENGTHEN OUR MILITARY.\nI DO THINK THAT IF WE CAN WORK WITH RUSSIA TO TAKE OUT ISIS IN\nTHE REGION, THAT'S GREAT BUT I WOULD URGE CAUTION WITH THE MAN.\nAGAIN, HE'S NOT OUR FRIEND, HE HAS NOT BEEN OUR FRIEND IN THE\nPAST, AND YOU LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN THE\nCYBERSECURITY WORLD, AS WELL, IN ADDITION TO WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING\nAT DOING WITH OUR ELECTION. >> CONGRESSMAN MIKE McCALL,\nTHANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. >> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.\n>> WE'RE POLL HE LOING A LOT OF",

ARE WE ON A HEIGHTENED STATE OF\nALERT? >> I WOULD CHARACTERIZE IT THIS\nWAY, JAKE. WE'RE ON A CONSTANT STATE OF\nALERT AGAINST NOT ONLY THE TERRORIST DIRECTORED ATTACK OF\nTHE 9/11 TYPE, BUT TERRORIST-INSPIRED ATTACKS.\nTHE SO-CALLED LONE WOLF, HOME GROWN VIOLENT EXTREMIST OF THE\nTYPE WE HAVE SEEN IN ORLANDO. WE'RE IN A RELATIVELY NEW\nENVIRONMENT NOW WHERE WE HAVE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE\nTRADITIONAL THREAT AS WELL AS THIS NEW THREAT WHERE AL QAEDA\nCAN REACH INTO OUR HOMELAND THROUGH THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL\nMEDIA TO RECRUIT AND INSPIRE PEOPLE HERE, WHICH MAKES FOR A\nMORE COMPLEX ENVIRONMENT INVOLVING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND\nOUR HOMELAND SECURITY PEOPLE WORKING HARD TO DEAL WITH IT.\n>> DO YOU THINK THAT NEW THREAT ENVIRONMENT MEANS THAT WE ARE\nNOT SAFER TODAY THAN WE WERE 15 YEARS AUGUST?\n>> GOOD QUESTION. WE'RE SAFER WHEN IT COMES TO THE\n9/11 STYLE ATTACK. IT'S PLOTS AGAINST THE HOMELAND\nIN OUR INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY ARE PRETTY GOOD NOW AT\nCONTACTING THOSE DOTS. WE HAVE THIS NEW ENVIRONMENT AND\nNEW THREAT, WHICH E WE JUST TALKED ABOUT WHICH MAKES IT\nHARDER AND WE'RE SEEING NOW ATTACKS IN ORLANDO AND SAN\nBERNARDINO THAT WE HAVE TO PROTECT AGAINST CHRKS IS WHY I\nCONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT PUBLIC VIGILANCE AND THE NEED TO BUILD\nBRIDGES TO COMMUNITIES THAT WE KNOW AND ARE TRYING TO RECRUIT\nWITHIN. THIS IS A NEW PHENOMENON.\nSO IT'S REALLY A MIXED ONE. WE'RE BETTER AT DETECTING THE\n9/11 ATTACK, BUT IT'S MORE CHALLENGING WITH THIS NEW\nENVIRONMENT THAT WE'RE IN. >> I U NOTICED PRESIDENT OBAMA\nHAS A NEW CONSTRUCT WHEN DESCRIBING HOW SAFE WE ARE.\nIT USED TO BE THAT HE WOULD SAY WE'RE SAFER THAN SIX YEARS AGO,\nWHATEVER. NOW HE SAYS WE'RE SAFER THAN E\nWE WOULD BE IF WE WEREN'T DOING WHAT WE'RE DOING.\nIT'S ALMOST AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE IDEA THAT BUZZ OF THIS LONE\nWOLF THREAT WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW SAFE WE ARE.\n>> SINCE I HAVE BEEN IN NATIONAL SECURITY BEGINNING IN 2009, WE\nHAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN DEGRADING AL QAEDA'S ABILITY\nTO ATTACK OUR O OHMLAND. .\nTHROUGH OUR EFFORTS OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, BUT\nTHERE'S THIS NEW FE NORMAL NORMAL OF THE LONE WOLF ATTACK.\nTHAT CHALLENGE FOR THE THING THAT KEEPS ME UP AT NIGHT.\nIT REQUIRES A WHOLE GOVERNMENT RESPONSE.\n>> SECRETARY JOHNSON, YOU WERE IN NEW YORK CITY ON 9/11.\nTELL US ABOUT THAT DAY FOR YOU. >> WELL 9/11 HAPPENS TO BE MY\nBTH. 9/11 WAS MY 4 HAD 4th BTH.\nI HAD LEFT THE PENTAGON NINE MONTHS BEFORE.\nI WAS GENERAL COUNSEL IN THE CLINTON YEARS.\nSEPTEMBER 11th, 2001, I COMMUTED IN TO MANHATTAN TO WORK.\nI WAS A LAWYER IN PRIVATE PRACTICE.\nAND FROM MY OFFICE WIN DON IN MIDTOWN MANHATTAN, I PRETTY MUCH\nOBSERVED THE WHOLE THING. LIKE A LOT OF AMERICANS, I\nWANTED TO DO SOMETHING. AND SO I SPENT THE LAST EIGHT\nYEARS NOW TRYING TO DO EXACTLY THAT.\n>> WHEN YOU SAY YOU SAW IT, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?\nDO YOU MEAN DID YOU SEE PEOPLE JUMPING FROM BUILDINGS?\nHOW VIVID WAS IT FOR YOU? >> I LOOKED OUT MY OFFICE W\nWINDOW.

SHE APPEARED UNSTEADY ON HER\nFEET YESTERDAY AT THE 9/11 MEMORIAL.\nTRACIE POTTS, HOW BAD IS THIS GOING TO HURT HER?\n>> Reporter: WELL, THE THING THAT WE FIRST NEED TO FIND OUT\nIS REALLY WHAT HER HEALTH SITUATION IS.\nHER DOCTORS SAY SHE'LL RECOVER WELL FROM PNEUMONIA AS MOST\nPEOPLE DO WITH ANTIBIOTICS AND WITH REST, BUT THE ISSUE HERE IS\nIN CONTEXT. LAST WEEK SHE HAD A COUGHING FIT\nAND HER DOCTOR SAID WAS SEASONAL ALLERGIES.\nIN 2012 SHE DEVELOPED A STOMACH VIRUS THAT TURNED INTO\nDEHYDRATION. SHE FELL AND HIT HER HEAD AND\nHAD A CONCUSSION. AND THEN THEY FOUND A BLOOD CLOT\nTHAT WAS ACTUALLY THE SECOND BLOOD CLOT SHE HAD DEALT WITH.\nSO THE BOTTOM LINE IS SHE HAS HAD SOME PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGED\nHEALTH PROBLEMS IN THE PAST. AND NEITHER SHE NOR DONALD TRUMP\nHAVE RELEASED THEIR FULL TIME HEALTH RECORDS AND WILL BE THE\nOLDEST AND SECOND OLDEST ELECTED TO THE PRESIDENCY DEPENDING ON\nWHO WINS. AS ONE DOCTOR PUT IT, THINGS\nTEND TO HAPPEN WHEN YOU GET OLDER AND PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW\nTHE HEALTH HISTORY OF BOTH OF THE CANDIDATES.\nBUT IN TERMS OF CLINTON, SHE'S RESTING AT HOME AND HAS CANCELED\nTHE EVENTS TO LIKELY CATCH UP ON THE REST SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO GET\nAFTER THE DIAGNOSIS ON FRIDAY. AND THE OTHER QUESTION IS\nPOPPING UP AFTER SHE WAS DIAGNOSED ON FRIDAY DID WE NOT\nFIND OUT SHE WAS BATTING PNEUMONIA UNTIL AFTER THE VIDEO\nAPPEARED ON SUNDAY. >> APART FROM THAT, IT'S NOT\nBEEN A GREAT WEEKEND FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nSHE ALSO MADE THAT VERY INFAMOUS COMMENT ON THE BASKET OF\nDEPLORABLES BUT SHE BACKTRACKED, HASN'T SHE?\n>> Reporter: SHE BACKTRACKED ON THAT BUT DIDN'T BACKTRACK ON THE\nFACT THAT SOME PEOPLE SHE DESCRIBE IN THE TERMS SUPPORT\nDONALD TRUMP. BUT THE PERCENTAGE, SHE SAID,\nHALF OF THE PEOPLE SUPPORTING HIM.\nAND SAID THAT WAS A MISTAKE. IT WAS AN OVERREACH AND\nOBVIOUSLY THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN JUMPED ON THIS SAYING SHE WAS\nOFFENDING MANY AMERICANS SUPPORTING HIS CAMPAIGN.\n>> AND TRACIE, WE HARDLY NEED ANOTHER REASON TO GET THIS\nCAMPAIGN MORE EXCITING, BUT THERE WERE QUESTIONS RAISED\nTOWARD THE END OF LAST WEEK ABOUT THE PHOTOS RELEASED OF\nFORMER PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP LOOKING RATHER\nCOZY TOGETHER. I HAVE TO WONDER IF THIS HURTS\nON BOTH SIDES HERE WHEN YOU HEAR TRUMP BEING SO CRITICAL OF THE\nCLINTONS AND THEN SEE BILL CLINTON AT ONE POINT SHAKING\nHANDS. DO YOU THINK THE VOTERS CARE\nABOUT THIS? >> Reporter: I DON'T KNOW.\nYOU KNOW, WE HAD PICTURES OF REMEMBERING HILLARY CLINTON AND\nGEORGE W. BUSH BEING COZY AND PEOPLE TALKING AT THAT FOR A FEW\nDAYS AND IT WAS FORGOTTEN. IT'S NO SECRET THAT THE TRUMPS\nAND THE CLINTONS KNEW EACH OTHER.\nHE TALKED ABOUT BEING INVITED TO THE WEDDING AND VICE VERSA.\nPEOPLE WHO RUN IN SIMILAR CIRCLES, POLITICS, NEW YORK,\nMONEY, OBVIOUSLY, ARE GOING TO HAVE SOME SOCIAL TIES FROM TIME\nTO TIME. YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW IF THIS\nIS GOING TO BE SOMETHING PEOPLE TALK ABOUT FOR MAYBE A DAY OR SO\nOR SOMETHING THAT REALLY AFFECTS ANYONE WHEN THEY GO INTO THE\nBOOTH TO VOTE. WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT IT'S\nPROBABLY GOING TO BE FAR OUTWEIGHED BY THE HEALTH ISSUES.\n>> TRACIE, THANK YOU FOR BRINGING US UP TO SPEED ON THE\nLATEST DEVELOPMENTS.

LEE\nREPORTED, ON FRIDAY, TYPICALLY THE EVALUATION IS AN X-RAY OR\nBLOOD WORK OFTEN IS DONE. IT'S A TOTALLY TREATABLE THING,\nNO QUESTION ABOUT IT. BUT IT IS A SERIOUS THING, AND\nSHOULD NOT BE TAKEN LIGHTLY. IT SOUNDS LIKE POPPY, DOCTOR\nWHAT YOU'RE HEARING AND WHAT THE STATEMENT READS THEY ARE TAKING\nIT MORE SERIOUSLY. >> STAY WITH ME, M.J. IS BACK\nWITH ME, AND THE SENIOR ADVISER TO THE CAMPAIGN TELLING HIM,\nCALIFORNIA TRIP, SERIOUS EVALUATIONS ARE UNDER WAY.\nIT DOESN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION WHY THE PUBLIC WAS NOT NOTIFIED\nOF THE DIAGNOSIS TWO DAYS AGO WHEN SHE RECEIVED IT.\n>> Reporter: YEAH, SO WE'RE STARTING TO SEE THE FIRST SIGNS\nTHAT PERHAPS HER TRIP TO THE WEST COAST TOMORROW COULD BE IN\nJEOPARDY HERE. AS YOU NOTED OUR JEFF ZELENY\nREPORTED THAT ACCORDING TO A SENIOR ADVISER, NOW THE\nCALIFORNIA TRIP THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO TAKE PLACE TOMORROW\nIS UP IN THE AIR. ALSO TO NOTE ACCORDING TO THE\nADVISER THERE ARE QUESTIONS NOW AS TO WHY CLINTON WENT TO A\nCAMPAIGN FUNDRAISER WITH BARBARA STREISAND ON FRIDAY.\nAND THAT IS IN REGARD TO THE NOTE ON FRIDAY, THE DIAGNOSIS ON\nFRIDAY. SHE IS TOLD TO REST, ON FRIDAY\nSHE HAD HAD A VERY BUSY SCHEDULE THAT STARTED WITH A NATIONAL\nSECURITY MEETING IN THE MORNING. A PRESS CONFERENCE, AFTER THAT\nMEETING. AND THEN SHE SAT DOWN WITH CHRIS\nCUOMO FOR AN INTERVIEW, AND THEN SHE WENT TO THIS FUNDRAISER.\nSO THAT WAS A PACKED CAMPAIGN SCHEDULE DAY.\nAND I THINK NOW THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS AS TO WHETHER SHE\nREALLY DOES NEED TO TAKE HER DOCTOR'S ADVICE A LITTLE MORE\nSERIOUSLY. >> M.J., STAY WITH ME, JEFF\nZELENY IS WITH US ON THE PHONE, JEFF THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE HEARING\nFROM THE CAMPAIGN, TELL US MORE. >> Reporter: POPPY, GOOD\nAFTERNOON, I'M HEARING AS M.J. SAID, THERE IS REALLY A\nCONVERSATION GOING ON AMONG CLINTON'S TOP ADVISERS ABOUT HOW\nTHEY HAVE BEEN SCHEDULING HER. THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF\nCONVERSATION AND CRITICISM FROM DONALD TRUMP, OH, SHE TAKES NAPS\nAND IS NOT OUT IN THE PUBLIC OFTEN.\nBUT THAT IS NOT ACTUALLY TRUE. IF YOU LOOK AT HER SCHEDULE,\nREALLY, I COVERED FIVE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS, ONE OF\nTHE MOST SCHEDULED CANDIDATES THAT I HAVE SEEN.\nAND IN THIS CASE, SOME ADVISERS WONDER IF SHE HAS BEEN\nOVER-SCHEDULED. AND THE FRIDAY EXAMPLE IS A KEY\nONE THEY'RE LOOKING AT. SHE WAS INDEED AS WE NOW KNOW\nDIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA ON FRIDAY.\nAND WE WERE AT THE BRIEFING ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON, AND THEN SHE\nWENT TO THE BARBARA STREISAND CONCERT FUNDRAISER.\nWHY DID SHE NEED TO BE THERE? THE CHECKS WERE ALREADY IN THE\nMAIL. THAT WAS A BIG USE OF HER TIME.\nAND IN FACT SHE ALSO USED THE TIME SHE GAVE A SPEECH THAT SHE\nMADE A COMMENT THAT SHE ENDED UP APOLOGIZING FOR ON SATURDAY, YOU\nKNOW, ABOUT HALF OF DONALD TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS REPRESENT\nDEPLORABLE PEOPLE. SO RIGHT NOW, POPPY, THERE IS A\nDISCUSSION GOING ON INSIDE CLINTON WORLD ABOUT HOW THEY\nHAVE SCHEDULED HER. AND YOU KNOW, THIS HEALTH\nCONCERN IS SOMETHING THAT IS ACTUALLY PRETTY SERIOUS.\nSHE IS YOU KNOW -- KEEPS A VERY AGGRESSIVE SCHEDULE.\nNO DOUBT SHE WANTS TO DO ALL OF THIS.\nSHE IS NOT ONE TO SAY NO IN THE WORDS OF ADVISERS.\nBUT THERE ARE NOW SUGGESTIONS AND CONVERSATIONS THAT HER\nCALIFORNIA TRIP TOMORROW SHE IS SCHEDULED TO GO TO SAN FRANCISCO\nMONDAY FOR A FUNDRAISER. TO LOS ANGELES ON TUESDAY FOR A\nCOUPLE OF FUNDRAISERS AND AN ECONOMIC SPEECH AND TO LAS VEGAS\nON WEDNESDAY. THIS SCHEDULE NOW IS IN\nQUESTION, I'M TOLD. AND AT THIS POINT THEY'RE\nREEVALUATING THE NEXT FEW DAYS AT LEAST AS SHE GETS HER HEALTH\nBACK UNDER WAY. >> AND JEFF, NOTABLE SILENCE\nFROM THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN ON THIS. >> IT REALLY IS INTERESTING,\nDONALD TRUMP HAS COMMENTED ON HER HEALTH REALLY THROUGHOUT THE\nCAMPAIGN, TALKING ABOUT HOW SHE TAKES NAPS AND HOW SHE IS NOT\nAGGRESSIVE IN CAMPAIGNING LIKE HIM.\nTHEY HAVE NOT SAID ANYTHING AT ALL.\nWE'LL SEE HOW LONG THAT LASTS, I THINK TODAY AT LEAST IT'S\nNOTABLE THAT THEY'RE NOT SAYING ANYTHING AT ALL HERE.\nBUT POPPY, INTERESTINGLY TO NOTE AT THIS POINT IN THE\nPRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN MOST CANDIDATES IN PREVIOUS CYCLES DO\nNOT OF A PERSON'S CANDIDACY, BUT YOU\nDO NOT HAVE TO GO TO ALL YOUR FUNDRAISERS.\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN, SHE HAS ACTUALLY STRUGGLED TO RAISE\nMONEY. SHE SHAS WORKED HARD THROUGHOUT\nTHE SUMMER TO RAISE MONEY AND GO TO ALL THESE EVENTS.\nSHE GOES IN A CLASSIC OLD-STYLE WAY AS OPPOSED TO MONEY COMING\nIN ON LINE AND OTHER THINGS, AND THEY'RE REALLY EVALUATING,\nWONDER FG TING IF THIS IS THE B USE OF HER TIME SOME 68 DAYS\nBEFORE ELECTION TIME HERE, AND THE CONSEQUENCES ARE CERTAINLY\nDEEP HERE, POPPY. >> JEFF ZELANY, STAY WITH ME AS\nYOU CONTINUE YOUR REPORTING AND REACHING OUT TO YOUR SOURCES.\nDR. SANJAY GUPTA, BACK TO YOU. IF SOMEBODY IS BEING TREATED FOR\nPNEUMONIA, HOW ARE THEY TREATED? WHAT MEDICATION DO THEY GET?\nARE THEY ALLOWED TO FLY? >> WELL, IT'S HARD TO PAINT THAT\nWITH A BROAD BRUSH STROKE. IT'S DIFFERING DEPENDING ON HOW\nSERIOUS IT IS, HOW SHE'S RESPONDING TO THERAPIES.\nBUT, AGAIN, AS I'VE BEEN SAYING, IT'S A MORE SERIOUS DIAGNOSIS,\nSO TYPICALLY IN THIS CASE IT SOUNDS LIKE SHE HAS A BACTERIAL\nPNEUMONIA, SO THIS IS A BACTERIA THAT'S CAUSING IT.\nIT'S AN INFECTION OF THE LUNG AND SHE'S BEING TREATED WITH\nANTIBIOTICS. TYPICALLY PEOPLE HAVE FEVERS,\nTHEY MAY HAVE CHEST TIGHTNESS, DIFFICULTY WITH BREATHING.\nWE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THESE COUGHING EPISODES SHE'S HAD\nRECENTLY. THEY COULD ALL BE RELATED.\nBUT YEAH, TYPICALLY YOU DO NEED A LOT OF REST, YOU DO NEED A LOT\nOF FLUIDS. YOU'RE LOSING FLUIDS BECAUSE OF\nTHE FEVER. YOU'RE LOSING FLUIDS BECAUSE OF\nTHE INFECTION. AND THERE IS NOT, I DON'T THINK,\nAN ABSOLUTE RULE AGAINST FLYING, BUT I THINK A LOT OF DOCTORS\nWOULD SUGGEST AGAINST IT BECAUSE OF THE -- COULD IT MAKE THE\nSYMPTOMS EVEN WORSE? I DON'T KNOW THAT IT WOULD MAKE\nTHE PNEUMONIA EVEN WORSE, BUT YOU MIGHT FEEL WORSE AS A RESULT\nOF THE FLYING. THERE IS WANT AN ABSOLUTE\nFORMULA HERE, BUT CLEARLY IT SOUNDS LIKE, AGAIN, ON FRIDAY,\nWE'RE HEARING THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME NOW, SOME OF THAT GUIDANCE\nWAS GIVEN. FALL BACK, GET REST.\n>> I WANT TO GO TO M.J. ON THIS. THE STATEMENT WE GOT FROM NICK\nMERRILL, THE SPOKESPERSON FOR HER CAMPAIGN HOURS AGO, MINUTES\nAFTER SHE LEFT THE 9/11 COMMEMORATION MEMORIAL CEREMONY\nEARLIER, ALL IT MENTIONED WAS OVERHEATING.\nIT DID NOT MENTION THE PNEUMONIA DIAGNOSIS, THE DIAGNOSIS THAT\nCAME TWO DAYS PRIOR. >> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT.\nWE'RE ONLY LEARNING ABOUT THE PNEUMONIA DIAGNOSIS TODAY.\nWE NOW KNOW THAT THE PNEUMONIA DIAGNOSIS ACTUALLY CAME FROM\nCLINTON'S DOCTOR ON FRIDAY. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE\nSORT OF THE DYNAMICS IN THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN RIGHT NOW\nTHAT MIGHT HAVE LED THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN TO DECIDE THAT THEY\nWANT HER TO BE AS ACTIVE AS SHE CAN BE.\nWE ARE TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT JEFF ZELANY AND HE'S\nREPORTING THAT THERE ARE QUESTIONS BEING RAISED ABOUT WHY\nSHE HAD TO GO TO THAT FUNDRAISER ON FRIDAY, FOR EXAMPLE.\nWELL, LOOK, WE ARE NOW IN THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER.\nTHERE IS LESS THAN TWO MONTHS LEFT UNTIL ELECTION DAY AND THE\nPOLLS HAVE BEEN TIGHTENING AND THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS VERY\nAWARE OF THAT. THEY KNOW THAT EVERY CAMPAIGN\nRALLY COUNTS, THEY KNOW THAT EVERY INTERACTION WITH THE MEDIA\nCOUNTS. THEY KNOW THAT EVERY MEETING\nCOUNTS, THEY KNOW THAT EVERY SIT-DOWN COUNTS.\nI THINK THIS IS AT A POINT AT THE CAMPAIGN WHEN THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGN WANTS TO MAKE AS MUCH EFFORT AS POSSIBLE TO GET H\nHER MESSAGE OUT THERE. THERE WAS AN INTERESTING MOMENT\nON CLINTON'S PLANE WHEN HER SPOKESMAN WAS TELLING REPORTERS\nABOUT HER PERSONAL STORY. A COMMENT THAT STAYED WITH ME,\nPALMERI WAS POINTING OUT THAT IT DOES TAKE A LITTLE MORE EFFORT\nON THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN'S PART TO HAVE SORT OF POSITIVE MESSAGE\nBREAK THROUGH BECAUSE OF THE KIND OF CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP\nIS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE.\nSO I THINK WE HAVE SEEN SOME SIGN THAT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN\nREALLY IS MAKING AN EFFORT TO GET HERSELF OUT THERE AND TO\nREALLY SET THE NARRATIVE FOR HERSELF ON HER OWN, ON HER OWN\nTERMS, AND I THINK FRIDAY WAS CLEARLY AN EXAMPLE OF PERHAPS\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN OVERSCHEDULING HER DESPITE THE\nDOCTOR'S ORDERS TO REST AND MODIFY HER SCHEDULE.\n>> AND JEFF ZELANY, TO YOU IN WASHINGTON JOINING US ON THE\nPHONE AGAIN, SANJAY SPOKE ABOUT THE FACT IT WOULD PROBABLY BE A\nGOOD IDEA FOR THE AMERICAN PUBLIC TO SEE THE HEALTH RECORDS\nOF ALL THE CANDIDATES. ANY INDICATION FROM THE CLINTON\nCAMP THAT THIS MAY CAUSE THEM TO RELEASE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT\nHER HEALTH, PUT THE HEALTH RECORDS OUT THERE?\n>> IT'S A GREAT QUESTION, POPPY. SO FAR NO.\nSO FAR THE CLINT ON CAMPAIGN HA NOT INDICATED THEY ARE ANY MORE\nLIKELY TO REVEAL A RELEASE OF THE SECRETARY'S ENTIRE HEALTH\nRECORDS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT\nSTATEMENT EARLIER THIS MORNING, IT DID NOT GIVE THE FULL STORY\nTHAT SHE WAS OVERHEATED. THAT STORY DIDN'T SOUND RIGHT AT\nTHE TIME. YES, IT WAS A WARM, MUGGY, HOT\nMORNING IN NEW YORK, AND YES, SHE MAY HAVE BEEN OVERDRESSED.\nWHEN YOU LOOKED AT HER SHE HAD A JACKET AND SHE WAS DRESSED MORE\nFOR A FALL DAY. BUT THE REALITY HERE IS THAT THE\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS NOT BEEN AS FORTHCOMING WITH MEDICAL RECORDS\nAS HAS NOT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. THIS IS AN ELECTION CYCLE THAT\nIS -- IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE HERE, THE AMERICAN VOTERS HAVE\nLESS INFORMATION ABOUT THE HEALTH AND, YOU KNOW, REALLY\nWHAT'S GOING ON HEALTHWISE WITH EITHER CANDIDATE THAN IN ANY\nRECENT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. AND IT'S ALSO THE ELECTION WHERE\nBOTH THE NOMINEES ARE THE OLDEST THAT THEY'VE EVER BEEN.\nWHOEVER IS SWORN INTO OFFICE HERE WILL BE THE OLDEST\nCANDIDATE SWORN INTO OFFICE HERE, AND IT'S A MOMENT FOR THE\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN TO POSSIBLY RELEASE RECORDS IF THEY DECIDE\nTO. DONALD TRUMP HAS NOT.\nCLINTON RELEASED MORE THAN TRUMP.\nHER RECORD FROM THE DOCTOR WAS LONGER.\nWE HAVEN'T SEEN RECORDS FROM OTHER YEARS.\n>> MUCH MORE ON OUR BREAKING NEWS.\nHILLARY CLINTON AGAIN DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA ON FRIDAY.\nJUST LEARNING ABOUT IT NOW AFTER SHE LEFT THAT 9/11 SERVICE EARLY\nTHIS MORNING.",

              "text": ">>> I'M POPPY HARLOW.\nBREAKING NEWS THIS HOUR. WE BEGIN WITH AN UPDATE ON\nHILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH, HER PRINCIPAL DOCTOR JUST ISSUING A\nSTATEMENT NOTING THAT HILLARY CLINTON ON FRIDAY WAS DIAGNOSED\nWITH PNEUMONIA. WE ALSO LEARNED IN THE PAST FEW\nMOMENTS THAT ACCORDING TO A SENIOR CAMPAIGN ADVISER, AN\nUPCOMING TRIP TO CALIFORNIA NOW IN THE AIR, SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO\nFLY TO ARIZONA TOMORROW. IN NEW YORK EARLY THIS MORNING,\nTWO LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCES TOLD CNN IT APPEARED THE CANDIDATE\nFAINTED. THE CAMPAIGN MANAGER WILL ONLY\nSAY SHE WAS OVERHEATED AND WAS DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA.\nDURING THAT FOLLOW-UP EVALUATION OF HER PROLONGED COUGH, SHE WAS\nDIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA. THIS IS ALL FROM HER DOCTOR, DR.\nLISA BARDACK. SHE WAS ADVISED TO REST AND\nREVISE HER SCHEDULE. WHILE AT THIS MORNING'S EVENT,\nSHE BECAME OVERHEATED AND DEHYDRATED.\nTHE DOCTOR SAID HE HAS EXAMINED HER AND SHE IS NOW REHYDRATED\nAND RECOVERING NICELY. THIS IS AFTER SHE WAS DIAGNOSED\nIN HER HOME IN CHAPPAQUA, NEW YORK.\nAFTER CLINTON LEFT THAT CEREMONY, SHE WENT TO HER\nDAUGHTER CHELSEA'S APARTMENT IN NEW YORK AND THEN WENT HOME WITH\nWHERE SHE WAS, AS WE KNOW, EXAMINED BY HER DOCTOR.\nM.J. LEE IS ALSO OUTSIDE THE APARTMENT OF CHELSEA CLINTON\nWHERE HILLARY CLINTON WENT, AND JEFF ZELANY IS ON THE PHONE WITH\nUS FROM WASHINGTON WITH ADDITIONAL REPORTING.\nSANJAY, LET'S GET YOUR REACTION TO THE NEWS THAT NOT ONLY\nSECRETARY CLINTON HAS PNEUMONIA, BUT THIS KDIAGNOSIS CAME ON\nFRIDAY AND THE PUBLIC DIDN'T LEARN ABOUT IT UNTIL JUST NOW.\n>> THAT WAS A BIT SURPRISING, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THERE WAS A\nSTATEMENT MADE AFTER SHE HAD THIS EPISODE WHERE SHE HAD\nDIFFICULTY GETTING INTO THE VAN. NO MENTION OF THE PNEUMONIA AT\nTHAT TIME, JUST SAYING SHE FELT OVERHEATED, ATTRIBUTING THE\nSYMPTOMS TO THAT. THE DIAGNOSIS OF PNEUMONIA\nTYPICALLY INVOLVES, BESIDES DOCTORS' VISITS, TYPICALLY\nINVOLVES BLOODWORK, CHEST X-RAYS, THINGS LIKE THAT.\nTHIS IS TYPICALLY DONE IN A CLINIC OR HOSPITAL OR SOMETHING\nLIKE THAT. IT'S A DIAGNOSIS THAT CAN BE\nTREATED. SHE'S ON ANTIBIOTICS WHICH MEANS\nA BACTERIAL PNEUMONIA. BUT IT'S A SERIOUS DIAGNOSIS.\nTHE DOCTOR RECOMMENDED REST, RECOMMENDED OBVIOUSLY STAYING\nWELL HYDRATED BECAUSE THERE IS A REAL CONCERN ABOUT DEHYDRATION.\nYOU'VE GOT THE FEVER. THE BACTERIAL INFECTION ITSELF\nCAN CAUSE THE DEHYDRATION. SO IT MAKES SENSE TO FIT THIS\nSTUFF TOGETHER, BUT IT STILL FEELS LIKE THERE IS A BEAT\nMISSING HERE. WE GOT INFORMATION LATE AND IT\nSTILL SEEMS INCOMPLETE. >> M.J. LEE, TO YOU.\nYOU WERE WITH SECRETARY CLINTON ON FRIDAY.\nYOU WERE AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE THAT SHE HELD.\nYOU KNOW SHE HAD A VERY, VERY BUSY SCHEDULE ON FRIDAY.\nARE YOU HEARING ANYTHING ELSE FROM THE CAMPAIGN AT THIS TIME?\nTHE LAST STATEMENT I BELIEVE WE RECEIVED FROM THE CAMPAIGN WAS\nHOURS AGO FROM NICK MERRILL WHO SAID SHE OVERHEATED.\nNOW THE DOCTOR SAYING THE PNEUMONIA DIAGNOSIS.\nANYTHING ELSE OFFICIAL FROM THE CAMP?\n>> NO WORD YET FROM THE CAMPAIGN AFTER THIS DOCTOR'S NOTE WAS\nRELEASED. WE DO NOT KNOW IF CLINTON WILL\nCONTINUE WITH HER CALIFORNIA TRIP TOMORROW.\nSHE WAS SET TO FLY OUT TO SAN FRANCISCO AND THEN GO TO L.A.\nSHE HAD MULTIPLE FUNDRAISERS AND EVENTS PLANNED FOR THIS WEEK, A\nBIG WEST COAST SWING. AND I THINK THE OTHER QUESTION\nTHAT THE CAMPAIGN POTENTIALLY NEEDS TO ADDRESS AND CERTAINLY\nWILL BE ASKED ABOUT A LOT IS WHY THE CAMPAIGN DIDN'T DISCLOSE ON\nFRIDAY, WHICH IS WHEN THE DOCTOR SAYS CLINTON WAS DIAGNOSED WITH\nPNEUMONIA, WHY THE CAMPAIGN DIDN'T MAKE THIS PUBLIC ON THAT\nDAY. I THINK TODAY, LEARNING THAT SHE\nWAS OVERHEATED, DEHYDRATED, THAT SORT OF SEEMS TO EXPLAIN WHY SHE\nSEEMED TO STUMBLE. SOME LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS\nSAID SHE APPEARED TO EVEN FAINT AS SHE WAS GETTING INTO THE VAN.\nBUT I THINK THE QUESTION ABOUT WHY THE PNEUMONIA DIAGNOSIS CAME\nON FRIDAY, BUT SHE DIDN'T ACTUALLY DISCLOSE THAT\nINFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC UNTIL TODAY, I THINK THAT'S A QUESTION\nTHAT THE CAMPAIGN WILL HAVE TO ANSWER OR WILL CERTAINLY BE\nASKED. >> AND JEFF ZELANY, TO YOU,",

              "text": "BREAKING NEWS INTO CNN.\nAN UPDATE ON PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HILLARY CLINTON'S\nHEALTH. WHAT WE HAVE JUST LEARNED FROM\nAN AIDE IS THAT HILLARY CLINTON'S DOCTOR ATTENDED TO HER\nHOME IN CHAPPAQUA TODAY AFTER SHE ARRIVED THERE.\nAND HERE IS THE FULL STATEMENT FROM HER DOCTOR, THE CHAIRMAN OF\nINTERNAL MEDICINE. SECRETARY CLINTON HAS BEEN\nEXPERIENCING A COUGH RELATED TO ALLERGIES.\nON FRIDAY, AFTER A FOLLOW-UP SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA AND\nPUT ON ANTIBIOTICS AND ADVISED TO REST AND MONITOR HER\nSCHEDULE. WHILE AT THIS MORNING'S EVENT,\nSHE BECAME OVERHEATED AND DEHYDRATED.\nSHE IS NOW REHYDRATED. SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH\nPNEUMONIA. CHECKED BY HER DOCTOR, THE\nDOCTOR SAID SHE IS RECOVERING NICELY AT HER HOME.\nSANJAY GUPTA, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID SHE HAS\nPNEUMONIA. >> WELL, IT'S THE FIRST OF WHAT\nWE'RE HEARING ABOUT. WE HEARD ABOUT THE COUGHING\nEPISODES SHE HAD. AND THOSE WERE ATTRIBUTED TO AS\nAND EVEN HEARD SHE WAS INCREASING THE DOSE OF HER\nANTIHISTAMINES. PNEUMONIA IS A VERY DIFFERENT\nDIAGNOSIS, OBVIOUSLY MEANS AN INFECTION OF THE LUNGS.\nTHE DOCTOR HAS PUT HER ON ANTIBIOTICS WHICH SUGGESTS IT'S\nA BACTERIAL INFECTION OF THE LUNGS.\nAND IT'S A VIRUS THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY SOMEBODY WOULD\nCURTAIL THEIR SCHEDULE, AND BASICALLY TAKE THE MEDICINES AND\nRECOVER. DESPITE THIS DIAGNOSIS THAT IT\nSOUNDS LIKE CAME ON FRIDAY, WE STILL OBVIOUSLY SAW THE SCHEDULE\nSHE WAS KEEPING WITH THIS PLANNED TRAVEL EVEN TOMORROW.\nAND THEN THE NOTE YOU JUST READ, POPPY, I SAW IT AS WELL.\nTHEY SAY THEY HAD ADVISED TO MODIFY THE SCHEDULE.\nI'M NOT SURE HOW THE SCHEDULE WAS MODIFIED IF IT WAS.\n>> WELL, IT IS INTERESTING, BECAUSE SHE SAT DOWN ON PROVIDE,\nTHE PNEUMONIA DIAGNOSIS CAME ON FRIDAY, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TIME\nIT CAME. ON FRIDAY, SHE SAT DOWN WITH AN\nINTERVIEW FOR OUR OWN CHRIS CUOMO, AND SHE WENT TO THE 9/11\nPLANS AND THE COMMEMORATION CEREMONY THIS MORNING.\nSANJAY, WE KNOW THAT IN SEPTEMBER, NOT LONG AGO SHE WAS\nIN CLEVELAND AND HAD A COUGHING FIT FOR A FEW MINUTES.\nTHAT NOW SEEMS TO MAKE MORE SENSE, RIGHT?\n>> IT SEEMS SO IT'S TOUGH TO PIECE IT TOGETHER, I DON'T THINK\nANYBODY CAN PIECE IT TOGETHER EXCEPT FOR HER AND HER DOCTOR.\nBUT THE DISTINGUISHED COUGHING EPISODE DUE TO ALLERGIES, WHICH\nWOULD BE SOMETHING THAT IS AN ALLERGAN, PNEUMONIA IS AN\nINFECTION OF THE LUNGS, AN INFECTION AS OPPOSED TO AN\nALLERGAN, IT IS TYPICALLY DIAGNOSED BECAUSE SOMEBODY HAS\nDIFFICULTY BREATHING, DONE WITH A CHEST X-RAY AND DONE IN A\nHOSPITAL. SO THESE COULD ALL WRAP TOGETHER\nSOMEHOW. MAYBE SHE THOUGHT IT WAS\nALLERGIES AND THEN THE DOCTOR DIAGNOSED HER WITH THIS\nPNEUMONIA AS TO CAUSING HER COUGHING.\nBUT YOU KNOW, AGAIN, I THINK WE'RE STILL DEALING WITH LIMITED\nINFORMATION HERE. THIS -- YOU KNOW, IT'S TOUGH AND\nIT'S SPECULATIVE WITHOUT MORE COMPLETE INFORMATION.\n>> RIGHT, AND THEREFORE IT'S HARD TO MAKE A JUDGMENT.\nONE OF THE QUESTIONS IS, IS SHE SUPPOSED TO TRAVEL ACROSS\nCOUNTRY TOMORROW TO CALIFORNIA FOR A FUNDRAISER?\nWELL, I GUESS SHE IS NOT YOUR PATIENT.\nYOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SAY WITH THIS MUCH INFORMATION THAT\nIS SOMETHING SHE SHOULD DO. >> ABSOLUTELY, THAT IS SOMETHING\nTHAT IS GOING TO BE TRUE FOR ANYONE, HER AND HER DOCTOR.\nPNEUMONIA, IF SOMEBODY HAS AN INFECTION OF THE LUNGS IT COULD\nTAKE A WHILE TO RECOVER FROM THAT.\nYOU ARE DEHYDRATED AND OFTENTIMES HAVE FEVERS.\nIT COULD MAKE THE DEHYDRATION WORSE, TYPICALLY ON A PLANE IT\nCOULD MAKE THINGS POTENTIALLY A LITTLE BIT WORSE.\nWHO KNOWS? I DON'T KNOW THE SEVERITY OF THE\nPNEUMONIA. DR. BARDEK SAYS SHE IS\nRECOVERING NICELY NOW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS,\nSHE CLEARLY HAD AN EPISODE TODAY AND HAD THIS DIAGNOSIS ON\nFRIDAY, ON MEDICATIONS, A NEW ONE WE'RE JUST LEARNING ABOUT\nRIGHT NOW. AN ANTIBIOTIC.\nSO THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS GOING ON PAINTING A BETTER\nPICTURE BUT STILL NOT A COMPLETE PICTURE.\n>> AND SANJAY, STAY WITH US, AS WE BRING IN OUR REPORTER OUTSIDE\nHILLARY CLINTON'S APARTMENT, WHERE SHE WENT TODAY AFTER SHE\nSTUMBLED AND GOT INTO THE VAN. I WANT TO BRING THE VIDEO\nGETTING INTO THE VAN BUT ALSO WALKING OUT OF CHELSEA CLINTON'S\nAPARTMENT. BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT\nTO SHOW HOW SHE WAS REACTING WHEN SHE CAME OUT OF THE VAN.\nARE THEY RESPONDING REGARDING THE STATEMENT FROM THE DOCTOR?\n>> Reporter: NOT QUITE YET. WE HAVE NOT HEARD FROM CLINTON'S\nCAMPAIGN AS TO WHETHER HER TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS WILL BE\nCHANGED. AS A RESULT OF THIS DOCTOR'S\nNOTE, THEY HAVE NOT -- CERTAINLY NOT REACTED TO THE NEW\nINFORMATION THAT WE'RE GETTING FROM HER LONG-TIME PHYSICIAN.\nI THINK AS SANJAY SAID THIS IS LIMITED INFORMATION STILL WE ARE\nDEALING WITH. BUT CERTAINLY VERY NEW\nINFORMATION WE'RE GETTING THAT SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA\nON FRIDAY. I FIND THAT VERY INTERESTING,\nBECAUSE RIGHT NOW TODAY IS SUNDAY.\nWE DID NOT KNOW MEMBERS OF THE PRESS, THE CAMPAIGN DID NOT\nINFORM ANYBODY THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS GOING ON, ON\nFRIDAY SHE HAD A BUSY SCHEDULE. SHE HAD A BIG NATIONAL SECURITY\nMEETING AND THEN HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE.\nAND IT IS ACTUALLY INTERESTING THINKING BACK TO THAT FRIDAY.\nI WAS IN THE ROOM WHEN SHE HELD THE PRESS CONFERENCE.\nAND I REMEMBER THINKING YOU COULD TELL SHE WAS STRUGGLING TO\nCONTAIN A COUGH. YOU COULD TELL HER THROAT WAS\nCLEARLY BOTHERING HER. YOU KNOW THAT IN RECENT WEEKS\nSHE HAS HAD THESE COUGHING FITS OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\nAND THEN WHEN SHE WAS DONE WITH THE PRESS CONFERENCE SHE LET OUT\nA BIG COUGH WHEN SHE WALKED AWAY FROM THE PODIUM.\nTHIS IS SOMETHING THE REPORTERS WERE TALKING ABOUT A LITTLE BIT\nAFTERWARDS AND JUST NOTING SOMETHING THAT WAS GOING ON.\nSO VERY INTERESTING SHE KNEW ABOUT THIS SINCE FRIDAY BUT\nCONTINUED ON -- PERHAPS THE DOCTOR'S DIAGNOSIS CAME AFTER\nTHAT PRESS CONFERENCE. WE DON'T REALLY KNOW.\nI THINK THE BIG QUESTION IS WHETHER THE CAMPAIGN WILL SORT\nOF TAKE THE ADVICE OF A DOCTOR P\nMORE SERIOUSLY. THE DOCTOR DID SAY IN THE LETTER\nSHE SHOULD REST AND MODIFY HER SCHEDULE.\nSHE IS SET TO GO TO CALIFORNIA TOMORROW, WE DON'T KNOW IF THE\nCAMPAIGN WILL CANCEL THAT OR DELAY THAT TRIP.\n>> AND M.J., YOU SAY IT IS INTERESTING WE'RE ONLY FINDING\nOUT NOW AND PERHAPS BECAUSE OF THIS EPISODE SHE WAS DIAGNOSED\nON FRIDAY. IS IT ATYPICAL FOR A CAMPAIGN TO\nNOT PUT THE INFORMATION OUT THERE RIGHT WHEN THEY LEARN\nABOUT THE DIAGNOSIS OR IS THAT STANDARD?\n>> Reporter: LOOK, CERTAINLY I CAN SAY THERE WERE MANY\nQUESTIONS SWIRLING ABOUT HER HEALTH, IN LARGE PART BECAUSE\nHER OPPONENT, DONALD TRUMP, AND HIS SURROGATES HAVE RAISED MANY\nQUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT SHE IS IN A GOOD STATE OF\nHEALTH. I THINK THIS IS A VERY SENSITIVE\nSUBJECT, SOMETHING THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS TRIED VERY HARD TO\nBRUSH AWAY. AND CERTAINLY THIS MORNING THAT\nWAS THE WORSE CASE SCENARIO WHERE YOU GET VIDEO OF HER\nSTUMBLING. LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS SAYING\nSHE APPEARED TO FAINT. THAT IS NOT THE KIND OF\nDISTRACTION THEY WANTED, ESPECIALLY THE KIND OF\nDISTRACTION RELATED TO HER HEALTH.\n>> ALL RIGHT, PLEASE STAY WITH ME.\nI WANT TO BRING IN DAN MERRICK, OUTSIDE OF CHAPPAQUA, OUTSIDE\nHER HOME, WE KNOW HILLARY CLINTON LEFT HER DAUGHTER,\nCHELSEA'S APARTMENT. AND DAN WHAT ARE YOU SEEING\nTHERE? WHAT IS THE MOOD SINCE HILLARY\nCLINTON ARRIVED THERE EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON.\n>> HEY, POPPY, WE HAVE NOT, IT IS PRETTY MUCH BUSINESS AS\nUSUAL, THE SECRET SERVICE BLOCKING THE AREA WHERE SHE\nLIVES. WE HAVEN'T SEEN HER COME OUT.\nSHE REPORTS SHE ARRIVED AT SOME TIME IN THE 1:00 HOUR.\nHER WAS WAITING FOR HER THERE AND CAME TO THE HOUSE TO EXAMINE\nHER THERE AFTER SHE HAD THIS INCIDENT LEAVING THE 9/11\nMEMORIAL. IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW AS M.J.\nSAID, THE DOCTOR SUGGESTED SHE MODIFY HER SCHEDULE.\nSHE AND HER PRESS CORPS ARE SUPPOSED TO FLY TO CALIFORNIA\nTOMORROW MORNING. AND THEN THERE IS A FUNDRAISER\nIN CALIFORNIA AND IN SAN FRANCISCO, AND THEN SHE HAS TWO\nFUNDRAISERS ON TUESDAY AS WELL AS AN EVENT IN THE LOS ANGELES\nAREA. AND THEN WEDNESDAY SHE IS\nSUPPOSED TO GIVE THE SPEECH AND CAMPAIGN MORE IN NEVADA IN LAS\nVEGAS. I'M TOLD THAT THE CAMPAIGN IS\nTAKING THE DOCTOR'S RECOMMENDATION SERIOUSLY.\nAND TAKE THE DIAGNOSIS OF PNEUMONIA SERIOUSLY.\nBUT AS OF NOW THERE IS NO CHANGE TO HER SCHEDULE.\nSHE IS STILL SLATED TO GO AND FLY TO L.A. TOMORROW.\nAND AS FOR HOW THE CAMPAIGN FEELS THEY KNOW THAT THIS IS YOU\nKNOW, LIKELY SOMETHING THAT TRUMP SUPPORTERS AND TRUMP MAYBE\nHIMSELF WILL USE TO POINT OUT SECRETARY CLINTON'S HEALTH,\nQUESTIONS ABOUT HER HEALTH. THEY CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN DOING\nTHAT. AND THE ISSUE WITH THE VIDEO IS\nTHAT QUESTIONS ABOUT HER HEALTH HAVE BEEN LIVING IN THE RIGHT\nWING NEWS SPHERE FOR A WHILE NOW.\nIT'S THE QUESTION SECRETARY CLINTON HAD TO WEIGH IN A FEW\nWEEKS FROM CLINTON'S DOCTOR. AND THE EVENTS FROM GROUND ZERO,\nIT WILL JUST ELEVATE AND MAKE IT MORE OF A MAINSTREAM\nCONVERSATION. >> AND DOUGLAS BRINKLEY, THE\nPRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN, JUST SAID TO ME EARLIER IN THE HOUR,\nSAID LOOK, IT COULD BE A PROBLEM IF SHE DOESN'T GET ON THE PLANE\nTOMORROW BUT HEALTH IS PRIMARY. I MEAN, THAT IS IT, RIGHT?\nDO YOU HAVE ANY INSIGHT INTO HOW",

AND THE VIDEO THAT WE HAVE BEEN\nPLAYING AND THE ELEMENTS WE HAVE BEEN PLAYING HAVE ELEVATED IT\nAND MADE IT INTO A TOPIC THAT THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA IS NOW\nTALKING ABOUT. >> TELL US, DAN, WHAT HAPPENED\nWHEN SHE LEFT THE 9/11 MEMORIAL EARLY.\nWE SAW HER STUMBLE AS SHE GOT INTO THE VAN.\nNORMALLY THE TRAVELING PRESS CORPS, AT LEAST A POOL OF\nREPORTERS WHO COVER HILLARY CLINTON, THEY WOULD FOLLOW THAT\nVAN WHEREVER IT IS GOING. BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE THEY\nLEFT WITHOUT THE PRESS CORPS. WHAT HAPPENED?\n>> SO IT'S A PROTECTIVE POOL, SO THE WHITE HOUSE, IT FOLLOWS\nPRESIDENT OBAMA WHEREVER HE GOES, IF HE GOES TO THE GYM,\nTHEY GO. IF HE GOES TO GET COFFEE, THEY\nGO. THE CAMPAIGN HAS NOT FULLY\nBOUGHT INTO THIS, MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT AT TIMES TO COVER HER.\nSHE LEFT UNDER THE MEMORIAL EVENT WHILE HER PRESS CORPS\nSTAYED IN THE MEDIA AREA WHERE THE MEDIA WAS FOR THE EVENT.\nSHE THEN WENT TO CHELSEA CLINTON'S HOUSE, AND THE PRESS\nPOOL GOT THERE LATER, AND THEN HILLARY CLINTON LEFT CHELSEA\nCLINTON'S HOUSE AND WENT BACK TO CHAPPAQUA, NEW YORK.\nIT'S AN ISSUE THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO COVER HER.\nYOU DON'T KNOW WHEN SHE IS GETTING HOME, WHERE SHE IS, THAT\nSORT OF THING. AND IT'S NOT REALLY STANDARD AT\nTHIS POINT IN THE CAMPAIGN. IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED,\nHOWEVER, THAT DONALD TRUMP WENT TO THE SAME MEMORIAL WITHOUT A\nPRESS POOL. >> SO RIGHT NOW, WE'RE BASICALLY\nSTANDING BY TO GET AN UPDATE FROM THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN,\nEITHER A WRITTEN STATEMENT OR SOME SORT OF APPEARANCE BEFORE\nTHE CAMERAS TO AT LEAST RECONFIRM THAT EVERYTHING IS\nSTILL ON SCHEDULE FOR THAT WEST COAST TRIP TOMORROW MORNING.\n>> ABSOLUTELY, AND THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.\nTHIS HAS BECOME A BIG MEDIA STORY.\nTHEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WEIGH IN TO TALK ABOUT HER HEALTH AND\nTO CONFIRM SHE IS STILL GOING TO FLY CROSS COUNTRY TOMORROW FOR\nWHAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED A FULL DAY OF CAMPAIGNING, A FUNDRAISER\nIN SAN FRANCISCO, MULTIPLE FUNDRAISERS IN L.A., AND EVENTS\nIN LOS ANGELES. ALL IN ABOUT 72 HOURS.\nSO THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CONFIRM THAT THAT IS STILL ON,\nGIVEN THAT SHE HAD THIS INCIDENT AFTER THE MEMORIAL SERVICE DOWN\nAT GROUND ZERO. >> DAN, AS SOON AS YOU GET WORD\nON WHAT IS GOING TO UNFOLD, GET BACK TO US, THANK YOU FOR YOUR\nEXCELLENT WORK ALL THE WAY AROUND.\nLET'S TAKE A QUICK BREAK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.              Woah!",

TAKE A LOOK, SHE GETS INTO THE\nVAN WITH THE HELP OF THE SECRET SERVICE.\nTHEY TOOK HER TO HER DAUGHTER'S APARTMENT IN NEW YORK, CHELSEA\nCLINTON. SHE WAS THERE FOR A BIT,\nSUPPOSEDLY AT HOME. THE LATEST IN CHAPPAQUA, NEW\nYORK, BUT WHAT IS THE LATEST ON HOW SHE IS DOING AND WHAT HER\nCAMPAIGN IS SAYING? >> Reporter: WELL, POPPY, WE\nACTUALLY HAVE NOT HEARD FROM THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN FOR SEVERAL\nHOURS NOW. THE ONLY STATEMENT WE GOT FROM\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN WAS LATE IN THE MORNING, WHEN HILLARY\nCLINTON DID IN FACT GET OVERHEATED.\nAND THAT IS WHY SHE LEFT THE 9/11 MEMORIAL EARLIER AND CAME\nTO CHELSEA CLINTON'S HOME. BUT WE DID LEARN THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON DID IN FACT APPEAR TO FAINT.\nI WANT TO BE CLEAR THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT THE CAMPAIGN\nCONFIRMED. BUT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS\nSAID HILLARY CLINTON DID IN FACT APPEAR TO FAINT THIS MORNING.\nWE'LL LEARN IF THEY GIVE US ANY INFORMATION ON HER STATUS RIGHT\nNOW. AND YOU'RE RIGHT, SHE DID COME\nHERE THIS MORNING TO HER DAUGHTER'S HOME.\nAND WHEN SHE CAME OUT SHE SAID SHE WAS FEELING GREAT, SMILING,\nEVEN ALPAUSED TO TAKE A PHOTO WH A LITTLE GIRL WAITING OUTSIDE.\nNO UPDATES AS OF RIGHT NOW ON WHETHER OR NOT THE EPISODE WILL\nEND UP AFFECTING HER TRAVEL PLANS.\nTOMORROW SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO FLY TO CALIFORNIA.\nSHE HAS A NUMBER OF FUNDRAISER AND CAMPAIGN EVENTS SCHEDULED ON\nTHE WEST COAST, WE DON'T KNOW YET IF ANY OF THOSE PLANS WILL\nBE AFFECTED. >> OKAY, M.J. LEE, THANK YOU FOR\nJOINING US. AND FOR THE UPDATE.\nLAST YEAR, HER PHYSICIAN DID RELEASE A LETTER SIGNING OFF ON\nHER HIT. THAT LETTER FROM DR. LISA\nBARDAK, SAYING THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS FIT TO SERVE AS\nPRESIDENT. CLINTON HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED AS\nHYPOTHYROIDISM. SHE TAKES A MEDICATION AND THE\nBLOOD THINNER, CUMADIN. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS WITH\nDR. SANJAY GUPTA. I WANT TO GET TO FIRST WHAT LAW\nENFORCEMENT REPORTED. THIS IS FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT,\nSAYING SHE APPEARS TO HAVE FAINTED.\n>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF THAT.\nPEOPLE USE THE TERM IN DIFFERENT WAYS, YOU SAW THE VIDEO, I'M NOT\nSURE IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE POINT WHERE SHE STUMBLED.\nAPPEARS TO HAVE FAINTED, VERSUS SOMEBODY WHO FAINTED OR LOST\nCONSCIOUSNESS, I DON'T KNOW, I CAN'T TELL, SO IF SOMEBODY IS\nSAYING THAT THEY SAW THAT AND THAT IS CONFIRMED.\nOBVIOUSLY THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER PIECE OF INFORMATION.\nBUT YOU HAVE TO PIECE IT TOGETHER WITH EVERYTHING ELSE\nSTILL. >> YOU'RE RIGHT, AND WE'RE JUST\nNOT GOING TO DO THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE EXTRAORDINARY ACCURATE\nWITH JUST WHAT WE SEE HERE. SO LET'S HAVE YOU LOOK AT WHAT\nYOU SEE, SANJAY GUPTA, HAPPENING.\n>> WELL, SHE IS CLEARLY GETTING HELP AS SHE STANDS THERE.\nLOOK AT THE MOVEMENTS, SHE HAS A DIFFICULTY WITH BALANCE, CLEARLY\nSTUMBLES, TRYING TO GET INTO THE VAN AT THAT POINT.\nAND THEN, OBVIOUSLY THE DOORS CLOSE AND WE DON'T SEE HER\nAGAIN, AN HOUR AND A HALF, TO TWO HOURS LATER WHERE SHE\nAPPEARS FINE.

SHE CLEARLY TRIED TO SQUASH THAT\nWHEN SHE LEFT HILLARY CLINTON'S HOME APARTMENT IN MANHATTAN\nTODAY. SHE WALKED OUT, SHE WAVED TO THE\nCROWD, A YOUNG GIRL KIND OF RAN OVER TO HER FROM A RESTAURANT\nNEARBY AND SAID SHE WAS FEELING GREAT AND A BEAUTIFUL NEW YORK\nDAY.

THIS IS SOMETHING TALKED ABOUT\nFOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS AND MONTHS AND THE CAMPAIGN ALREADY\nRESPONDED TO IT. THERE'S NO INDICATION SHE'LL\nGIVE A STATEMENT TO THE PRESS OR HAVE HER DOCTOR COME OUT.\nIT'S CLEARLY SOMETHING THEY HAVE TO ADDRESS IN THE COMING DAYS\nWHAT HAPPENED. THEY SAID SHE GOT OVERHEATED,\nBUT THE VIDEO SHOWS HER KIND OF WITH A LOWING INTO THE CAR SO\nTHERE'S GOING TO BE MORE QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE\nANSWERED. SHE'S SUPPOSED TO FLY TO\nCALIFORNIA FOR A FUND-RAISER IN SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES SO\nWE'RE EXPECTING OR HOPING WE'LL SEE HER, MAYBE GET TO TALK TO\nHER SOMETIME TOMORROW ON THE PLANE.\n>> AS OF NOW THAT TRIP IS STILL SCHEDULED?\n>> Reporter: AS OF NOW THE TRIP IS STILL SCHEDULED.\nSCHEE HAS AN EVENT IN LOS ANGELES AND LAS VEGAS EARLY NEXT\nWEEK.

TRUMP SAID IF IRANIAN SHIPS\nTHREATEN AMERICAN VESSELS HE WOULD QUOTE, BLOW THEM OUT OF\nTHE WATER. >> IRAN, WHEN THEY CIRCLE OUR\nBEAUTIFUL DESTROYERS WITH THEIR LITTLE BOATS AND THEY MAKE\nGESTURES AT OUR PEOPLE THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO MAKE,\nTHEY WILL BE SHOT OUT OF THE WATER.\n>> ALL RIGHT. LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.\nJOINING ME IS LIEUTENANT GENERAL MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY\nANALYST AND FORMER ARMY COMMANDING GENERAL IN EUROPE AND\nMIKE BAKER, FORMER CIA COVERT OPERATIONS OFFICER.\nWELCOME TO BOTH OF YOU. GENERAL, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF\nTHOSE COMMENTS ABOUT BLOWING THESE IRANIAN SHIPS OUT OF THE\nWATER? >> WHAT I WOULD COMMENT ON IS\nTHAT COMMANDERS ON THE SCENE, EITHER A NAVY CAPTAIN ON A SHIP\nOR A GROUND COMMANDER OR AIR COMMANDER, HAS TO MAKE THESE\nKIND OF DECISIONS IN TERMS OF WHAT IS THREATENING VERSUS\nWHAT'S JUST HARASSMENT. I SAW THE FILMS OF THE HARASSING\nPATROL BOATS AGAINST THE CRUISER AND IN FACT, YEAH, IT WAS\nUNPROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOR ON THE PART OF THE IRANIANS BUT IT'S\nNOT SOMETHING YOU WANT TO GENERATE WORLD WAR III OVER.\nYOU DON'T SHOOT BOATS OUT OF THE WATER WHEN THEY ARE IN\nINTERNATIONAL SEAS EVEN IF THEY ARE PERFORMING HARASSING\nACTIONS. THERE ARE OTHER ACTIONS THAT\nTHAT NAVY COMMANDER CAN TAKE BEFORE HE ACTUALLY PULLS THE\nTRIGGER. NOW, HE CERTAINLY CAN DO THAT AT\nANY GIVEN TIME IF HE FEELS HIS SHIP IS THREATENED BUT IN THIS\nCASE IT'S MOSTLY HARASSMENT. TRUTHFULLY, THIS GOES ON ALL\nOVER THE WORLD BETWEEN NAVIES, ARMIES AND AIR FORCES WITH\nDIFFERENT PATROLS. >> SO MIKE, DO YOU THINK MR.\nTRUMP MEANT THAT? >> YOU KNOW, DETERMINING WHAT\nMR. TRUMP MEANS FROM DAY TO DAY IS WAY ABOVE MY PAY GRADE,\nFRANKLY. THE LIEUTENANT GENERAL IS FAR,\nFAR MORE EXPERIENCED AND ABLE TO TALK TO THE MECHANICS OF THIS\nAND RESPONSE ON THE HIGH SEAS OR IN ANY THEATER.\nBUT I WILL SAY THAT IT'S UNNECESSARY AS FAR AS THE\nCOMMENT GOES, IT'S UNREALISTIC, IT'S A NAIVE THING TO SAY WHEN\nYOU ARE TALKING ABOUT GESTURES. AS LIEUTENANT GENERAL JUST\nMENTIONED, SUGGESTING YOU WOULD SHOOT BECAUSE SOMEBODY IS SIMPLY\nHARASSING AND NOT LEGITIMATELY THREATENING THE SAFETY OF YOUR\nPERSONNEL AND ASSETS IS, YOU KNOW, BORDERS ON RIDICULOUS.\nIT'S UNFORTUNATE AND ALSO I THINK IT POINTS TO ONE THING, I\nHAVE ALWAYS FELT THAT PRESIDENTS THAT WE HAVE, ANY PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATE, IT WOULD BE NICE TO THINK THEY HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE\nWITH THE MILITARY IN SOME FORM BECAUSE THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND\nTHE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS. I THINK WHAT WE ARE SEEING FROM\nDONALD TRUMP IS YET AGAIN, ANOTHER COMMENT THAT HE'S MAKING\nOFF THE CUFF, FINE, HE'S SPEAKING EXTEMPORANEOUSLY, A LOT\nOF PEOPLE IN HIS CAMP LIKE THAT. I THINK THEY LIKE THE SABER\nRATTLING AND THE NOTION WE WILL BE STRONG OUT THERE BUT YOU HAVE\nTO BE REALISTIC, PRAGMATIC AND UNDERSTAND THE REAL WORLD IS\nDIFFERENT FROM THROWING OUT A COMMENT LIKE THIS.\n>> I THINK MIKE BRINGS UP A GOOD POINT.\nLIKE MANY OF TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS, THAT KIND OF LANGUAGE APPEALS TO\nTHEM BECAUSE THEY DO THINK IF YOU LET IRANIAN SHIPS HARASS\nAMERICAN SHIPS, THAT AMERICA IS SHOWING WEAKNESS.\nWHY ISN'T THAT WEAK? >> IT'S NOT WEAK, THEY HAVE\nACTIONS THEY CAN TAKE, CAROL, THAT ARE BELOW THE LEVEL OF\nBLOWING THEM OUT OF THE WATER. THAT WOULD BE ACTUALLY AN ACT OF\nWAR. HARASSMENT IS NOT AN ACT OF WAR.\nYOU PULL THE TRIGGER FIRST, YOU ARE ACTUALLY GENERATING THAT WAR\nCONDITION. I'M NOT SURE WITH ALL THE\nHARASSMENT THAT GOES ON BETWEEN FORCES ALL OVER THE WORLD THAT\nYOU WOULD BE SOON IN FIGHTS AGAINST IRAN, RUSSIA, CHINA AND\nA VARIETY OF OTHER NATIONS WHO DO THESE KIND OF ACTIONS.\nTHE OTHER THING IS, AS I JUST MENTIONED, THE COMMANDERS ON THE\nSCENE ARE BETTER TRAINED. CERTAINLY I HEARD MR. TRUMP'S\nCOMMENT AND THE REACTION BY THOSE IN THE CROWD.\nTHERE IS THAT SABER RATTLING. I WOULD ALSO SUGGEST THAT THE\nPEOPLE WHO WERE CHEERING ARE NOT PART OF THE LESS THAN 1% WHO\nWERE ACTUALLY ON THE FRONT LINES WEARING THE UNIFORM THAT\nACTUALLY HAVE TO TAKE THE ACTION.\nIT'S WELL AND GOOD TO RATTLE SABERS UNTIL YOU'RE THE ONE THAT\nHAS TO EITHER EXECUTE THE MISSION OR SUFFER THE\nCONSEQUENCES OF THOSE KIND OF MISSIONS.\nI DON'T THINK TRUTHFULLY, HAVING BEEN A COMMANDER OF A LARGE\nNUMBER OF FORCES, THAT THE U.S. MILITARY IS DISRESPECTED.\nIN FACT, THE KIND OF ACTIONS THIS NAVY CAPTAIN TOOK TO ENSURE\nTHAT HIS SHIP WAS SAFE BUT AT THE SAME TIME NOT GOING\nOVERBOARD IN TERMS OF HIS ACTIONS WAS ACTUALLY EXTREMELY\nPROFESSIONAL AND WELL MANNERED ON HIS PART.\nTHAT'S THE KIND OF OPERATIONAL FORCES WE NEED IN THIS WORLD.\n>> SO JUST ONE MORE QUESTION TO YOU, MIKE, ABOUT VLADIMIR PUTIN\nTHIS TIME, BECAUSE THE EX-CIA ACTING DIRECTOR MIKE MORELL CAME\nOUT AND SAID TRUMP IS PLAYING PERFECTLY INTO THE RUSSIAN\nPRESIDENT'S HANDS. >> I THINK VLADIMIR PUTIN\nCONSIDERS HIM AN UNWITTING AGENT.\nPUTIN PLAYED TO TRUMP BY TELLING TRUMP WHAT HE WANTED TO HEAR,\nWHICH IS I'M A GREAT GUY, I'M SMARTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE, I'M A\nGREAT PERSON. PUTIN PLAYED TO THAT.\nPUTIN'S A TRAINED INTELLIGENCE OFFICER.\nHE KNOWS HOW TO PLAY TO PEOPLE. WHAT WAS THE RESULT OF PUTIN\nPRAISING DONALD TRUMP? DONALD TRUMP IN TURN PRAISING\nVLADIMIR PUTIN. >> SO MIKE, IS MR. TRUMP BEING\nPLAYED BY VLADIMIR PUTIN? >> WELL, IN THIS INSTANCE, YES.\nI SUPPOSE ANOTHER WAY TO PUT IT WOULD BE THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN,\nWHO IS AN OLD SCHOOL KGB OFFICER AND VERY DISCIPLINED, VERY\nWELL-TRAINED FROM THE OLD DAYS, HE'S TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THINGS\nTHAT DONALD TRUMP AND ALSO NOW MIKE PENCE, BECAUSE PENCE BACKED\nHIM UP ON THIS, ALTHOUGH HE TRIED TO WALK THAT TALK BACK\nRECENTLY, HE'S TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THESE COMMENTS AND AGAIN,\nIT'S AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING THAT'S UNNECESSARY.\nYOU DON'T NEED TO BE SAYING THESE THINGS AS A PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATE AND THERE'S A CERTAIN LEVEL OF, AGAIN, HE'S SPEAKING\nEXTEMPORANEOUSLY, JUST THROWING THESE THINGS OUT BUT THERE'S A\nNAIVETE THERE THAT IS WORRISOME. PUTIN WILL TURN THIS TO HIS\nADVANTAGE AND HE WILL, AS HE ALWAYS DOES.\nONE OF THE THINGS HE ALWAYS REACHES INTO HIS KIT BAG FOR IS\nTHE IDEA OF NATIONALISM AND YOU KNOW, IT'S US AGAINST THEM, AND\nTHAT PLAYS WELL IN RUSSIA. IT PLAYS WELL WITH THE\nPOPULATION PSYCHE IN A SENSE. BEING SUFFERING AND\nLONG-SUFFERING AGAINST THE WORLD.\nSO PUTIN IS ABSOLUTELY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE THINGS THAT\nTRUMP HAS BEEN SAYING. >> INTERESTING.\n>> I WOULD ADD, WHAT'S INTERESTING, ANYONE WHO HAS\nTHESE KIND OF EXPERIENCES KNOWS WHAT'S SAID ON CNN OR FOX NEWS\nOR ANY OTHER MAJOR U.S. CHANNEL THAT IS FREE PRESS IS QUICKLY\nPLAYED AGAIN IN COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD THAT DON'T HAVE A FREE\nPRESS. I THINK THAT'S ALREADY OCCURRING\nIN TERMS OF MR. PUTIN'S RUSSIA WHERE YOU ARE TAKING SOUND BITES\nFROM BOTH OF THE CANDIDATES AND SAYING PUT THAT ON IF THAT\nSUPPORTS THE RUSSIAN VIEW OF THE WORLD AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE, MR.\nTRUMP CONTINUES TO SAY THESE KIND OF THINGS WHICH LEVIES MORE\nPRAISE TOWARD MR. PUTIN WHO IS NOT THAT CHARISMATIC IN EASTERN\nEUROPE OR WESTERN EUROPE. HE IS CHARISMATIC IN HIS OWN\nCOUNTRY. >> I HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE.\nMANY THANKS. I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE WITH\nME THIS MORNING.",

LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.\nWITH ME NOW TO DISCUSS IS CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR AND DAILY\nBEAST COLUMNIST AND HILLARY CLINTON SUPPORTER SOLELY CON AND\nCNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR JEFFREY LORD.\nWELCOME TO BOTH OF YOU. >> HAPPY MONDAY.\n>> THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A HAPPY MONDAY, JEFFREY.\nI'VE TOLD YOU THAT MANY TIMES. >> I KNOW\n>> SO BACK TO WHAT MR. TRUMP SAID ON CNBC.\nIS HE SERIOUS? HE JUST WANTS TO SIT ONSTAGE\nWITH HILLARY CLINTON AND CHAT? >> WELL, TWON THINGS.\nNUMBER ONE THAT IS HOW LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DID IT.\nAND THOSE WERE PRETTY REMARKABLE DEBATES.\nTHAT'S NUMBER ONE. I REMEMBER NEWT GINGRICH\nCHALLENGING -- I'M SORRY, WHAT? >> I WISH THEY COULD HAVE BEEN\nTAPED. BUT ALAS --\n>> YEAH. I'M WITH YOU.\nI'M WITH YOU. >> SECONDLY AS TO WHAT DONALD\nTRUMP SAID THIS MORNING I'M LOOKING AT A \"WALL STREET\nJOURNAL\" EDITORIAL THIS MORNING WHICH SAYS LIBERAL MEDIA\nWATCHDOGS IN THE WORDS OF \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\" WERE GOING\nAFTER MATT LAUER BECAUSE OF HIS TREATMENT OF MRS. CLINTON AND\nI'LL READ YOU THIS LAST SENTENCE.\nTHIS IS BEST UNDERSTOOD AS A COLLECTIVE WARNING TO THE\nMODERATORS OF THE COMING DEBATES, NOT TO JEOPARDIZE THEIR\nSTANDING IN POLITE PROGRESSIVE COMPANY BY DOING THE SAME.\nTHAT'S IN ESSENCE WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS SAYING, AS WELL.\nSO THE ARGUMENT CLEARLY IS OUT THERE.\nSO LESTER HOLT WILL MODERATE THAT FIRST DEBATE.\nIS IT POSSIBLE HE'LL DOUBLE DOWN ON DONALD TRUMP SINCE HIS\nCOLLEAGUE MATT LAUER SUPPOSEDLY WENT LIGHT ON MR. TRUMP?\n>> I THINK IF WE'RE REPRESENTING HIM AS HAVING BEEN LIGHT ON\nTRUMP, THAT'S A MISCHARACTERIZATION.\nHE WAS LIGHT ON TRUTH. THAT WAS THE ISSUE WITH MATT\nLAUER. HE WAS NOT ACTUALLY PLAYING THE\nROLE THE MODERATOR SHOULD IN FACT CHECKING AND HOLDING THE\nCANDIDATES ACCOUNTABLE. LOOK, THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT.\nA MODERATOR ISN'T JUST A GLORIFIED TIME KEEPER WHO KEEPS\nAN EYE ON THE CLOCK AND BLOWS THE WHISTLE.\nTHEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE A REFEREE.\nAND THE SIMPLE FACT HERE IS THAT IF ONE TEAM CONSTANTLY CROSSES\nTHE FOUL LINE, OR MORE THAN THE OTHER TEAM, THEN THE JOB OF THE\nMODERATOR IS TO CALL FOUL. DONALD TRUMP HAS A RECORD OF NOT\nTELLING THE TRUTH OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN ACCORDING TO FACT\nCHECKERS. HE DOES NOT TELL THE TRUTH THREE\nOUT OF EVERY FOUR STATEMENTS HE ASSERTS.\nSO IF THE MODERATOR POINTS THAT OUT, HE'S NOT BEING BIASED.\nHE'S NOT BEING AGAINST TRUMP. HE'S BEING FOR THE TRUTH.\nAND THAT'S THE JOB OF A MODERATOR.\n>> SO JEFFREY, DO YOU AGREE THAT THAT'S THE JOB OF A MODERATOR,\nTO MAKE SURE -- >> NO, I DON'T.\n>> -- BOTH CANDIDATES ARE TELLING THE TRUTH?\n>> NO, I DON'T. I THINK IT WAS CHRIS WALLACE WHO\nSAID HE'S NOT GOING TO SEE -- HE'S ONE OF THE MODERATORS, THAT\nHE'S NOT GOING TO SIT THERE AND BE A FACT CHECKER.\nI THINK THAT'S UP TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE FACT\nCHECKERS THAT SALLY CITES SOME OF THESE FACT CHECKING KWOIT\nUNQUOTE SITES ARE BASICALLY LIBERAL AND THEY HAVE A BIAS\nGOING INTO IT SO I REALLY DON'T COUNT THEM MUCH AS FACT CHECKERS\nAS MUCH AS I DO -- >> WHO WOULD BE THE ULTIMATE\nFACT CHECKER IN YOUR MIND, JEFFREY?\n>> THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\nLET THE CANDIDATES SAY \"A,\" \"B,\" OR \"Z,\" AND THEN --\n>> DO YOU THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE -- WHERE WOULD THEY LOOK\nTO FIND IF THE ANSWER IS TRUE OR NOT?\n>> SURE. BECAUSE CAROL I GUARANTEE YOU\nTHAT THE MOMENT THAT THIS DEBATE IS OVER, YOUR SHOW AND ALL OF\nCNN, AND EVERYWHERE ELSE IN THE MEDIA UNIVERSE IS GOING TO HAVE\nPEOPLE LIKE SALLY AND I ON TO DISCUSS AND DEBATE, AND WE'LL\nALL BE OUT THERE DEBATING. AND WE'LL BE DOING INTERVIEWS.\n>> WE AS JOURNALISTS WILL BE DOING OUR JOB IN FACT CHECKING\nBOTH CANDIDATES. GO AHEAD, SALLY.\n>> WITH ALL DUE RESPECT JEFFREY YOU AND I ARE PAID FOR OUR\nOPINIONS. WE OFFER OPINIONS, AND YOU AND I\nALSO MASSAGE THE FACTS TO MAKE THEM FIT OUR SIDE OR THE OTHER.\nSO THERE DOES HAVE TO BE, IN THE MEDIA, AND IN THIS ELECTION,\nSOME SEMBLANCE OF OBJECTIVITY, AND THE FACT IS --\n>> BUT THERE ISN'T ANY. >> MORE PEOPLE TURN INTO THAT\nDEBATE -- HANG ON A SECOND AND A WON'T WATCH THE COMMENTARY OR\nREAD THE ANALYSIS AFTER THE FACT.\nTO CHRIS WALLACE AS AN EXAMPLE THAT ONE FOX NEWS DEBATE WAS\nFABULOUS WHERE THEY HAD THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES ON THE\nSTAGE AND THEY USED THEIR OWN WORDS AND THEIR OWN VIDEO CLIPS\nTO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR THINGS THEY'VE SAID BEFORE.\nLOOK, IF AS HE DID IN THE NBC -- IN THE NBC FORUM IF DONALD TRUMP\nSAYS I WAS AGAINST THE IRAQ WAR ALL ALONG, AND THE AMERICAN\nPEOPLE HEAR HIM SAY THAT, THEY HAVE -- MANY DO NOT HAVE THE\nGROUNDS TO KNOW WHETHER THAT'S A FACTUAL STATEMENT OR NOT.\nIT IS IT IS A PATENTLY UNTRUE STATEMENT.\nHE HAS FLIP-FLOPPED ON THIS SUPPORT FOR THE IRAQ WAR.\nPERIOD. YOU CAN'T ARGUE IT.\nYOU CAN'T DEBATE IT. THAT'S A FACT AND THE AMERICAN\nPEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW THE FACTS WHEN IT COMES TO BOTH\nCANDIDATES. I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE WE'RE\nDEBATING THIS AS SOMETHING THAT'S GOOD FOR DEMOCRACY.\n>> WOULD YOU WANT CHRIS WALLACE TO FACT CHECK HILLARY CLINTON?\n>> NO. SEE THIS IS THE POINT.\nAND IF I MAY SPEAK UP FOR MY, YOU KNOW, ADMITTEDLY I'M BIASED\nHERE, MY CNN COLLEAGUE, OUR CNN COLLEAGUE ANDERSON COOPER, HE\nDOES A FABULOUS JOB WITH THESE DEBATES.\nBUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS I CAN TELL YOU NOW THAT THE MOMENT\nTHAT DEBATE WITH ANDERSON IS OFF THE AIR, THERE ARE GOING TO BE\nPEOPLE OUT THERE PICKING APART THE WAY HE DID THIS.\nTHAT'S JUST THE NATURE OF THE BEAST.\nTHAT'S PART OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY AND I THINK WE SHOULD\nALL RELAX, CHILL OUT AND LET IT HAPPEN AND GO ON FROM THERE.\n>> DOES THAT MEAN MR. TRUMP IS WRONG AND THERE SHOULD BE A\nMODERATOR JEFFREY? >> NO, NO, NO.\nI THINK HE'S GOT A GREAT SUGGESTION ABOUT THIS.\nI REALLY DO. I THINK THAT WOULD BE A\nFASCINATING THING TO SEE HE AND HILLARY CLINTON SIT THERE AND\nTHE ONLY PERSON ELSE ON STAGE IS A TIME KEEPER.\n>> IT COULD BE FASCINATING OR LIKE A REALLY BAD THANKSGIVING\nDINNER. >> ROLLER DERBY DEBATE STYLE.\n>> SO FILLED WITH UNCHECKED LIES AND MISREPRESENTATIONS.\nBUT YOU KNOW, HEY, WHY EXPECT MORE.\n>> -- WILL BE THERE TO FACT CHECK THE NEXT DAY.\n>> I WILL BE. THANKS TO BOTH OF YOU.\nBE SURE TO JOIN WOLF BLITZER AS HE INTERVIEWS MIKE PENCE\nMR. TRUMP'S RUNNING MATE LIVE IN THE SITUATION ROOM 5:00 P.M.\nEASTERN TODAY ON CNN.

I MEAN, HE'S JUST REALLY SAID\nONLY ONE WORD AND THAT'S IT. AND I THINK PUTIN'S VERY CAREFUL\nABOUT NOT SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT EITHER OF THE CANDIDATES.\nTHAT WILL BE VERY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.\nI THINK THERE'S A LOT OF MISUNDERSTANDING HERE.\nMAYBE IT'S DELIBERATE. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS HE HAS\nNOT SAID ANY POSITIVE THING ABOUT TRUMP OR HILLARY CLINTON.\n>> BUT WHAT OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT IS LEADING TO HIS FEELING\nTHAT VLADIMIR PUTIN WANTS DONALD TRUMP TO WIN, IS THAT OUR\nINTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS IN THE U.S. BELIEVE THAT RUSSIA WAS\nBEHIND THE HACKING INTO THE DNC COMPUTERS AND THEREBY TRYING TO\nSWAY THE ELECTION TOWARDS DONALD TRUMP?\nWHAT'S YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT? >> WELL ACCORDING TO THE\nINFORMATION I HAVE THE RUSSIANS ARE REALLY GOOD HACKERS.\nMATTER OF FACT THEY'RE THE BEST IN THE WORLD.\nAGAIN ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION I HAVE.\n>> FROM THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT. >> HOW THAT CAN AFFECT THE\nELECTION -- NO, NO. I'M SAYING THE RUSSIANS ARE VERY\nGOOD AT THIS. THERE ARE A LOT OF RUSSIANS\nWORKING IN SILICON VALLEY WHO ARE VERY WELL KNOWN FOR HAVING\nTHAT MASTERS OF THAT KIND OF THING.\nIT'S NOT THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT, IT'S THE -- THEIR CONCRETE\nPEOPLE WHO KNOW HOW TO DO IT. NOW, WHETHER THE RUSSIAN\nGOVERNMENT HAS USED SOME OF THESE PEOPLE TO HACK IN TO VERY\nSECRET INFORMATION IS QUITE POSSIBLE.\nI THINK THAT THERE'S GENERALLY A LOT OF HACKING GOING ON ON BOTH\nSIDES. EVERYONE'S TRYING TO HACK\nEVERYONE ELSE. WHAT I FIND DOUBTFUL IS AN\nATTEMPT ON THE PART OF THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT TO INFLUENCE\nTHE ELECTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES.\nI DON'T SEE HOW THEY CAN POSSIBLY DO THAT.\nNOW, IF, INDEED, THEY HAVE THIS INFORMATION CONCERNING THE\nE-MAILS THAT HAVE DISAPPEARED, AND THEN IN OCTOBER SUDDENLY\nTHEY APPEAR, AND THEY COME FROM THE RUSSIAN SIDE, THEN ONE MIGHT\nSAY YES, INDEED, THEN YOU WOULD HAVE A REASON TO SAY THAT THE\nRUSSIANS, THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT, IS TRYING TO\nINFLUENCE THE ELECTIONS AND PROBABLY THAT WOULD INFLUENCE\nTHE ELECTION. BUT IF THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN, THEN\nAGAIN IT'S JUST -- IT'S JUST CAMPAIGN RHETORIC, THAT'S ALL IT\nIS. >> HMM.\nBUT YOU KNOW VLADIMIR PUTIN. DO YOU THINK THAT HE WANTS\nDONALD TRUMP TO WIN THE ELECTION?\n>> PARDON ME? >> YOU KNOW VLADIMIR PUTIN.\nSO GIVE US SOME INSIGHT. DO YOU THINK HE'S PULLING FOR\nDONALD TRUMP ON SOME LEVEL? >> UM, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW\nHIM THAT WELL. YOU KNOW, I'VE MET HIM.\nI HAD A ONE-ON-ONE WITH HIM FOR ABOUT AN HOUR.\nI'VE MET HIM A FEW TIMES AFTER THAT.\nI CAN'T SAY I KNOW HIM IN ANY INTIMATE WAY.\nI DON'T THINK SO. I THINK PUTIN IS VERY -- HE\nDOESN'T TRUST ANY OF THE WESTERN LEADERS.\nI THINK HE FEELS THAT THE WEST HAS IT IN FOR HIM, AND HAS IT IN\nFOR RUSSIA. I THINK HIS VIEW IS THAT YOU\nCAN'T REALLY MAKE ANY SERIOUS DEALS, IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DO\nTHAT. TIME AND AGAIN HE TOLD ME HE'S\nBEEN MISLED BY THE WEST, THE ENLARGEMENT OF NATO IS JUST ONE\nEXAMPLE OF THAT. SO I THINK THAT HIS FEELING IS\nIT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER WHO BECOMES PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES INSOFAR AS RUSSIA IS CONCERNED.\nRUSSIA IS GOING TO BE CONSISTENTLY UNDER PRESSURE FROM\nTHE U.S. MR. PUTIN'S GOING TO BE UNDER\nPRESSURE.

READ THE NAMES OF THE DEAD AT\nGROUND ZERO. ALMOST 3,000 OF THEM.\nTHE PRESIDENT HONORED VICTIMS IN A CEREMONY AT THE PENTAGON AND\nIN PENNSYLVANIA BELLS RANG TO REMEMBER THE PASSENGERS AND\nCREW, THOSE HEROIC MEN AND WOMEN.\nIT'S AN INTENSE EMOTIONAL DAY FOR ALL AMERICANS AND THE\nGATHERINGS THROUGH THE TOP OFFICIALS.\nGROUND SZERO, TWO NEW YORKERS CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP ARRIVED\nTO PAY RESPECTS. THAT WAS BEFORE CLINTON LEFT THE\nCEREMONY AFTER BEING OVERHEATED. WITH US NOW TO TALK ABOUT\nNATIONAL SECURITY IS A FORMER ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE CIA.\nHE'S SUPPORTING HILLARY CLINTON NOW.\nTHANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. WE APPRECIATE IT.\nDO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH?\nYOU'RE NOT A CAMPAIGN PERSON BUT YOU HAVE ENDORSED HER.\n>> ONE IS I WAS WITH HER ON FRIDAY AT A NATIONAL SECURITY\nSESSION IN NEW YORK. SHE LOOKED FANTASTIC U.\nSHE HAD HIGH ENERGY. THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY IS\nTHERE ARE TIMES IN ALL OF OUR LIVES WHERE WE DON'T FEEL WELL.\nI MISSED SOME OF THE BRIEFINGS AFTER 9/11 BECAUSE I WASN'T\nFEELING WELL. LET'S NOT MAKE MORE OF THIS THAN\nTHERE IS. >> I WANT TO MOVE ON.\nI WANT TO TALK ABOUT ONE OTHER THING WHICH IS HILLARY CLINTON\nAT A FUNDRAISER REFERRING TO HALF OF DONALD TRUMP EEGS\nSUPPORTERS AS BEING IN A BASKET OF DEPLORABLES.\nSHE SAID THAT SHE REGRETS NOW SAYING HALF, BUT LET'S PLAY THAT\nSOUND IF WE CAN. >> JUST BE GROSSLY GENERAL ISTI,\nYOU COULD PUT HALF OF TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS INTO THE BASKET OF\nDEPLORABLES. RACIST, SEXIST, HOMOPHOBIC,\nISLAM PHOBIC, YOU NAME IT. >> SHE'S SINCE SAID SHE REGRETS\nSAYING HALF, BUT SHE MAINTAINS THAT DONALD TRUMP DOES HAVE THE\nSUPPORTERS WHO ARE DEPLORABLE. IT'S A PRETTY, AS SHE SAID\nHERSELF A GROSS GENERALIZATION TO DESCRIBE MILLIONS OF\nAMERICANS THAT WAY. >> I'LL LET WHAT E SHE SAID\nSTAND. SHE SAID SHE REGRETS SAYING IT.\nI'LL LEAVE IT THERE. >> ARE YOU TROUBLED AT ALL IN\nTHE SAME WAY SHE SEEMS TO BE? >> I THINK THERE'S SOME PEOPLE\nWHO ARE SUPPORTING HIM BECAUSE OF THE THINGS HE HAS SAID.\nAND I WORRY ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE TOO.\nSO I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT. >> I WANT TO TALK ABOUT NATIONAL\nSECURITY ISSUES, WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY WHY YOU'RE HERE.\nI WOULD ALSO NOTE AND I KNOW I DON'T HAVE TO REMIND YOU THIS IN\nADDITION TO BEING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE SEPTEMBER\n11th ATTACKS IN 2001, IT'S ALSO THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE THE\nBENGHAZI ATTACKS IN WHICH WE LOST FOUR BRAVE AMERICANS.\nYOU WERE AT THE CIA AT THE TIME. WHAT LESSONS WOULD YOU SAY YOU\nLEARNED FROM THAT DAY? >> I THINK THE KEY LESSON, AND I\nTHINK THIS HAS BEEN LOST ALL THE WAY AROUND, ALL ALONG, THIS\nWHOLE EPISODE, IS THAT BECAUSE VIOLENT EXTREMISM, THE IDEOLOGY\nHAS SPREAD SO FAR IN PLACES LIKE LIBYA AND PLACES LIKE SYRIA AND\nIRAQ AND YEMEN WHERE WE MIGHT HAVE FACILITIES WE HAVE TO\nPROTECT THEM AS IF THEY ARE WAR ZONES.\nAND THAT MEANS RINGING THEM WITH SECURITY, THAT MEANS HAVING THE\nKIND OF INTELLIGENCE YOU HAVE ON THE GROUND IN A WAR ZONE TO\nPROTECT YOURSELF FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO ATTACK YOU.\nTHAT'S THE MAIN LESSON LEARNED. >> IS THERE ALSO A LESSON, A LOT\nOF PEOPLE CRITICIZE UED THE WHITE HOUSE FOR BEING FOCUSED ON\nTHE NARRATIVE THIS WASN'T A TERRORIST ATTACK.\nTHIS WAS BECAUSE OF THE ANTI-MUSLIM VIDEO.\nALSO A A LESSON IN MAKING SURE THAT WHITE HOUSE IS TRANSPARENT\nABOUT WHAT HAPPENS AND DOESN'T GET SWEPT UP IN A POLITICAL\nNARRATIVE? >> TWO THINGS.\nONE IS THERE IS NO DICHOTOMY BETWEEN THE VIDEO POSSIBLE CAUSE\nING THE ATTACK AND IT BEING A TERRORIST ATTACK.\n. IT CAN BE BOTH OF THOSE THINGS.\nTHAT'S BEEN LOST ON A LOT OF PEOPLE.\nTHE ONLY GUY WHOSE BEEN ARRESTED AND BROUGHT TO JUSTICE FOR THIS\nATTACK TOLD THE FBI THAT ONE OF THE TWO REASONS E HE CONDUCTED\nTHE ATTACK WAS BECAUSE OF THE VIDEO.\nSO THERE'S THIS IDEA THAT ONE OF THE GUYS SAID IT WAS THE VIDEO.\nSO IN TERMS OF THE POLITICS OF THIS FOR ME THE LESSON IS WHEN\nIT BECOMES POLITICAL, GET ALL THE INFORMATION OUT THERE SAZ\nFAST AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN. THAT'S THE POLITICAL LESSON FOR\nME. >> YOU HAVE A SCATHING OP-ED IN\n\"THE WASHINGTON POST\" THIS WEEKEND WRITTEN ALONGSIDE YOUR\nFELLOW NATIONAL SECURITY EXPERT. >> MIKE VICKERS.\n>> FORMERLY WITH WHOM YOU USED TO WORK.\nTHEN YOU'D ALSO WRITTEN ONE IN THE \"NEW YORK TIMES\" PREVIOUSLY\nIN WHICH YOU SUGGESTED THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS AN UNWITTING\nAGENT OF VLADIMIR PUTIN AND THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION.\nARE YOU BEING FACETIOUS THERE OR DO YOU REALLY THINK HE'S BEEN\nDUPE D BY VLADIMIR PUTIN? >> I'M NOT BEING FACETIOUS AT\nALL. I THINK VLADIMIR PUTIN CONSIDERS\nHIM AN UNWITTING AGENT. THAT'S SOMETHING WHO DOES WHAT\nYOU WANT THEM TO DO WITHOUT THEM KNOWING YOU'RE DOING IT ON THEIR\nBEHALF. PUTIN PLAYED TO TRUMP BY TELLING\nTRUMP WHAT HE WANTED TO HEAR, WHICH IS I'M A GREAT GUY, I'M\nSMARTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE, I'M A GREAT PERSON.\nPUTIN PLAYED TO THAT. HE'S A TRAINED INTELLIGENCE\nOFFICER. HE KNOWS HOW TO PLAY U TO\nPEOPLE. WHAT WAS THE RESULT?\nDONALD TRUMP IN TURN PRAISING VLADIMIR PUTIN.\nDONALD TRUMP SAYING THAT WE MIGHT NOT DEFEND THEB BALTICES.\nIT MIGHT BE O OKAY THAT PUTIN GRABBED CRIMEA.\nDONALD TRUMP IS A GREAT LEADER. ALL OF THAT PLAYS RIGHT INTO\nPUTIN'S HANDS. SO ABSOLUTELY I THINK PUTIN SEES\nHIM AS AN UNWITTING AGENT. >> HILLARY CLINTON SAID\nSOMETHING ABOUT VLADIMIR PUTIN TELLING CHRIS CUOMO THAT\nVLADIMIR PUTIN HAS TRIED TO DISRUPT ELECTIONS HERE IN THE\nUNITED STATES. I U KNOW THAT SOME\nCOUNTERTERRORISM OFFICIALS BELIEVE THAT SOME OF THE HACKS\nTHE DNC ONE IN PARTICULAR WERE DONE BY RUSSIAN HACKERS.\nIS THERE ACTUAL EVIDENCE THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN IS TRYING TO\nDISRUPT THIS ELECTION? >> I HAVE NOT SEEN THE EVIDENCE.\nI'M NOT IN THE GOVERNMENT ANYMORE.\nI'M NOT IN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY.\nBUT PUTIN HAS A LONG TRACK RECORD OF INTERFERING IN THE\nELECTIONS OF THE COUNTRIES AROUND RUSSIA AND FORMER SOVIET\nUN UNION.\nUSING CYBER OPERATIONS, INFORMATION OPERATIONS, PAYING\nPOLITICAL PARTIES, HE'S DONE SOME OF THAT IN WESTERN EUROPE.\nI BELIEVE THAT HE IS BEHIND THE HACK OF THE DNC.\nI BELIEVE THAT HE HAS GIVEN THOSE E-MAILS TO WIKILEAKS AND I\nBELIEVE THERE'S A PLAN TO STRING THOSE OUT TO MAKE HER LOOK BAD.\nHE WANTS DONALD TRUMP TO WIN THIS ELECTION.\nIN PART BECAUSE OF THE ROMANCE BETWEEN THE TWO.\nAND IN PART BECAUSE PUTIN DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT HILLARY CLINTON\nWILL BE EASY ON RUSSIA. >> CAN PUTIN AND/OR THESE\nRUSSIAN HACKERS WHO YOU'RE SUGGESTING ANSWERED TO HIM, CAN\nHE ACTUALLY AFFECT THE ELECTION NOT JUST IN TERMS OF THE\nPROPAGANDA OR MATERIALS OR E E-MAILS BUT IN CHANGE ING THE\nRESULTS OF THE ELECTION. >> HE MIGHT THINK HE CAN HAVE AN\nKMALKT, BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S POSSIBLE.\n>> IN 2012 WHEN MITT ROMNEY SAID U THAT RUSSIA WAS THE NATION'S\nNUMBER ONE GEOPOLITICAL FOE AND THEY MOCKED HIM FOR IT, I THINK\nTHAT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT ROMNEY WAS RIGHT AND THE GENERALS ALL\nSAY RUSSIA IS THE NUMBER ONE GEOPOLITICAL FOE.\nI THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WATCHING THINK -- YOU\nWEREN'T SAYING THAT IN 2012. BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GETTING\nWHIPLASH. THEY ARE SAYING NOW RUSSIA IS\nOUR NUMBER ONE FOE. FOUR YEARS AGO THE MEDIA WAS\nMOCKING REPUBLICANS FOR SAYING THAT.\n>> I I WOULDN'T SAY RUSSIA IS THE NUMBER ONE FOE.\nCOUNTERTERRORISM, TOP OF THE LIST.\nNORTH KOREA, RUSSIA, CHINA, THEY ARE ALL IN A GROUP AT THE TOP.\nRUSSIA HAS BEEN AN ADVERSARY FOR A LONG TIME.\nSOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN IN THE INTELLIGENCE BUSINESS KNOWS\nTHAT. THEY NEVER STOPPED PLAY ING THE\nINTELLIGENCE GAME. THIS IS A BAD GUY.\nTHIS IS A THUG AND A BULLY. S THAT GUY WHO ONLY UNDERSTANDS\nRELATIVE POWER. THIS IS A GUY THAT DOESN'T\nBELIEVE IT'S POSSIBLE TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE A NEGOTIATION.\nTHIS IS A GUY WHO IF HE PUNCHES YOU IN THE FACE, YOU HAVE TO\nPUNCH HIM BACK IN THE FACE. >> IT'S A PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU\nON THE SHOW. >> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.\n>> I HOPE IT'S A MEANINGFUL DAY FOR YOU.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH. STAY WITH US.\nFOR THE LATEST ON HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH, WE'LL HAVE A\nLIVE REPORT AFTER THE BREAK. STAY WITH US.",

WE LEARNED ABOUT WHAT WAS\nHAPPENING IN NEW YORK. GOT TO TVs AS QUICKLY AS\nPOSSIBLE TO BEGIN MONITORING IT. IT WAS JUST A SICKENING\nEXPERIENCE, CHRIS. AND I WENT THE NEXT DAY, CHUCK\nSCHUMER AND I, WE WERE ONE OF THE VERY FEW PLANES IN THE SKY\nTHAT DAY, THE 12th. AND WE LANDED AT LaGUARDIA.\nWE WERE ON A FEMA PLANE.

I REMEMBER ONE IMAGE SO\nINDELIBLY DRAGGING HIS AX. AND IT WAS AS CLOSE TO A\nDEPICTION OF HELL THAT I'VE EVER PERSONALLY SEEN.\nTHERE WAS A LOT THAT I REMEMBER FROM THOSE EARLY DAYS AND FROM\nALL THE DAYS AFTER BECAUSE, AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL, I FELT SUCH\nA RESPONSIBILITY TO REACH OUT AND HELP EVERYONE WHO HAD BEEN\nAFFECTED BY THIS TERRIBLE ATTACK.\nTHERE WEREN'T THAT MANY SURVIVORS, THE ONES WHO DID\nSURVIVE WERE GRIEVOUSLY INJURED. THE LOSS OF LIFE WAS\nOVERWHELMING. I WENT, LIKE SO MANY OTHERS, TO\nTHE ARMORY AND THE PIERS LOOKING TO SEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING, HOW\nPEOPLE WERE REACTING. BUT IT WAS ALSO, YOU KNOW, MY\nJOB AND THE JOB OF OTHER ELECTED OFFICIALS TO GET OUR CITY AND\nOUR STATE AND OUR COUNTRY WHAT WE NEEDED.\nSO I WENT BACK THAT NIGHT, AND CHUCK AND I HAD BEEN AT A BIG\nMEETING WITH ALL THE LOCAL, STATE, FEDERAL OFFICIALS.\nWE GOT WORD JUST SHOCKINGLY THAT THE WHITE HOUSE HAD SENT UP A\nREQUEST FOR $20 BILLION BECAUSE, OF COURSE, THE PENTAGON HAD BEEN\nHIT. WE WERE GOING TO HAVE TO\nIMMEDIATELY START HARDENING OUR SECURITY.\nAND THERE WASN'T ONE PENNY FOR NEW YORK.\nAND CHUCK WAS TRYING TO FIND HIS FAMILY.\nHE HADN'T SEEN HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN.\nI GOT THE LAST TRAIN OUT OF PENN STATION AND GOT TO WASHINGTON IN\nTHE EARLY MORNING AND WENT IMMEDIATELY HOME, CHANGED,\nSHOWERED, GOT TO THE SENATE, WHERE I BEGAN TALKING WITH MY\nCOLLEAGUES ABOUT WHAT I HAD SEEN AND WHAT WE WERE GOING TO NEED\nIN ORDER TO REBUILD. LATER THAT DAY, CHUCK AND I WENT\nWITH THE TWO SENATORS FROM VIRGINIA TO THE WHITE HOUSE, AND\nIT WAS JUST THE FOUR OF US, PLUS PRESIDENT BUSH AND HIS TOP\nOFFICIALS, AND WE WERE DESCRIBING WHAT WE HAD SEEN.\nTHIS WAS THE DAY BEFORE HE HIMSELF WENT.\nAND PRESIDENT BUSH SAID, WHAT DO YOU NEED?\nAND WE SAID, WE NEED $20 BILLION.\nHE SAID, YOU GOT IT. AND HE MEANT IT, AND THERE WERE\nA LOT OF EFFORTS TO UNDO THAT PLEDGE STARTING ALMOST\nIMMEDIATELY, BUT WE WERE ABLE TO COUNT ON HIM, AND IT MEANT A LOT\nTO HELP THE FAMILIES, THE VICTIMS, THE DOWNTOWN,\nEVERYTHING THAT NEEDED TO BE REBUILT AND GIVE PEOPLE HOPE\nAGAIN. IT DID BECOME VERY PERSONAL FOR\nME. I SAW SO MANY PROBLEMS THAT\nOTHERS WEREN'T YET AWARE OF BECAUSE I WAS LISTENING AND\nWATCHING, AND ONE OF THE THINGS WAS WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO, YOU\nKNOW, THE PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND PARTICULARLY\nTHE PEOPLE WORKING ON THE PILE BECAUSE IT WAS CLEAR THEY WERE\nBEING AFFECTED BY THIS TOXIC BREW OF WHAT HAD BEEN BOMBED BY\nTHE PLANES AND WAS IN THE AIR. AND UNFORTUNATELY, THE\nADMINISTRATION KEPT SAYING, NO, THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF THAT.\nYOU COULD SEE THE EVIDENCE. YOU COULD SMELL IT.\nYOU COULD TASTE THE EVIDENCE. SO I BECAME VERY PASSIONATE\nABOUT HELPING EVERYONE WHOSE OWN HEALTH WAS GOING TO BE DAMAGED\nBECAUSE THEY HAD PUT THEMSELVES OUT TO HELP.\nAND WHEN I MET THE FAMILIES OF THE INJURED, YOU KNOW,\nPROFOUNDLY BURNED, IN COMAS, INDUCED COMAS FOR MONTHS, THE\nWHOLE BOTTOM HALF OF A YOUNG WOMAN'S BODY VUL PERRIZED BY\nBEING HIT WITH SOME PIECE FROM THE PLANE.\nRECENTLY ENGAGED. LOOKING FORWARD TO SOMEHOW\nFIGURING OUT HOW SHE COULD WALK AT HER WEDDING.\n>> HER FIANCE REFUSING TO LEAVE. HER BEGGING HIM NOT TO MARRY HER\nAND MOVE ON WITH HIS LIFE AND HIM REFUSING TO LEAVE.\n>> WHEN I FIRST VISITED HER AT THE HOSPITAL.\nSHE WAS AT THE OLD ST. VINCENT'S HOSPITAL ORIGINALLY.\nSHE WAS SO PROFOUNDLY INJURED. BEAUTIFUL FACE.\nLONG HAIR. MANAGED EVEN THROUGH ALL THE\nPAIN TO DISPLAY IT, A WHIMSICAL HUMOROUS PERSONALITY.\nAND SHE DESPERATELY WANTED TO GO ON WITH HER LIFE, BUT SHE FEARED\nTHAT SHE COULDN'T. WELL, YOU KNOW, I DID EVERYTHING\nI COULD TO HELP HER BECAUSE I KEEP THINKING, WHAT ARE WE HERE\nFOR? NOT JUST WHAT ARE WE HERE IF\nYOU'RE IN PUBLIC SERVICE. WHAT ARE WE HERE ON THIS EARTH\nFOR? WHAT IS THE PURPOSE?\nAND I JUST FEEL SO STRONGLY. AND PART IS TO, YOU KNOW, DO\nWHATEVER WE CAN WITH WHATEVER SKILLS AND RESOURCES WE HAVE TO\nHELP OTHERS. AND THE NEED WAS SO GREAT AND SO\nPRESENT AND EVERY PLACE WE WENT PEOPLE HUNTING FOR THEIR\nRELATIVES, YOU KNOW, I WAS WORKING HARD TO SET UP THE\nVICTIMS' COMPENSATION FUND AND WORKED CLOSELY WITH KENT\nFEINBERG. AND I'D HAVE TO SEND ONE OF MY\nSTAFFERS TO GO KNOCK ON A WIDOW'S DOOR AS SHE STILL AFTER\nSIX MONTHS COULD NOT GET OUT OF BED.\nAND I WOULD MEET THESE SHATTERED LIVES OF PEOPLE WHERE THEY WERE\nBROKEN, BUT I SAW SO MANY OF THEM STRENGTHEN AND SHOW SUCH\nRESILIENCE. SO I FELT PRIVILEGED.\nYOU KNOW, WHATEVER I COULD DO WAS AN HONOR.\nBUT IT GAVE ME AN INSIGHT INTO E HUMAN SPIRIT AND I LIKE TO\nTHINK THE SPIRIT OF NEW YORK AND AMERICA THAT I WISH EVERY\nAMERICAN COULD UNDERSTAND BECAUSE IT'S WHAT MAKES US WHO\nWE ARE AND HOW LUCKY, BLESSED WE ARE TO FACE TERRIBLE TRAGEDIES\nBUT TO RECOVER, TO MOVE FORWARD, TO KEEP THINKING ABOUT THE\nFUTURE. >> COMING UP, HOW AMERICANS ARE\nPAYING THEIR RESPECTS TO THOSE LIVES LOST IN THE WORST TERROR\nATTACK IN U.S. HISTORY.                \u00e2\u0099\u00aa\u00e2\u0099\u00aa",

HAVE WE HEARD ANYTHING FROM THE\nCAMPAIGN TONIGHT AT ALL?

AS WE'VE REPORTED, SECRETARY\nCLINTON AND HER AIDES ARE DISCUSSING WHETHER TO CANCEL THE\nCALIFORNIA TRIP THAT STARTS TOMORROW.\nSHE HAS A LARGE FUND-RAISER IN THE BAY AREA.\nFLIES TO L.A. HAS TWO LARGE FUND-RAISERS IN\nL.A. IN THE L.A.

CLEARLY THE CAMPAIGN SAW THAT\nSTATEMENT BEFORE IT WENT OUT. SO IT'S TELLING THAT THEY LET\nTHAT GET OUT. LET HER SAY THAT.\nIT'S KIND OF A NOD TO THE FACT THAT THEY ARE TAKING THIS\nSERIOUSLY, BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY WE ARE\nFINDING OUT NOW WHEN SHE WAS DIAGNOSED ON FRIDAY.\n>> ALL RIGHT. DAN, STAY WITH ME.\nLET'S JUST SPEAK ABOUT THIS SCHEDULE BECAUSE EVEN ON FRIDAY\nWHEN WE NOW KNOW THAT DIAGNOSIS OF PNEUMONIA CAME.\nSHE HAD THIS MEETING ON NATIONAL SECURITY, SHE HAD A PRESS\nCONFERENCE. SAT DOWN WITH OUR CHRIS CUOMO\nFOR AN INTERVIEW. I MEAN, SHE WAS PRETTY MUCH\nGOING NONSTOP ON FRIDAY THEN WENT TO THAT BIG FUND-RAISER\nWITH BARBRA STREISAND ON FRIDAY NIGHT.\n>> RIGHT. I THINK THAT POINTS TO THE FACT\nTHAT ESPECIALLY NOW AFTER LABOR DAY, THE TEMPO HAS JUST PICKED\nUP TREMENDOUSLY. SHE'S ON THE CAMPAIGN PLANE WITH\nREPORTERS. SHE'S ALSO DOING GAGGLES, A NEWS\nCONFERENCE AND SO ON. SO I CAN TELL YOU ALSO FROM\nCOVERING MRS. CLINTON, FRANKLY, FOR TWO DECADES OFF AND ON, THAT\nONE OF THE THINGS THAT SHE HAS OFTEN TRIED TO PROJECT IS\nSTRENGTH AND THAT WHATEVER HAPPENS, SHE JUST KEEPS GOING.\nSO WE DON'T KNOW SPECIFICALLY WHY SHE DIDN'T CUT BACK ON HER\nSCHEDULE OR WHATEVER BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT HILLARY CLINTON\nTRIES TO PUSH AND PUSH AND PUSH. AND I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THOSE\nTHINGS SORT OF INDICATED BACK ON LABOR DAY WHEN SHE WAS IN\nCLEVELAND, OHIO. I WAS THERE.\nDAN MERICA WAS THERE ALSO WHERE SHE HAD THAT EXTENDED\nCOUGHING FIT. NOW THEY'VE GOT A LOT OF\nPUBLICITY, BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS SHE'S HAD SOME OTHER\nEXTENDED COUGHING FITS AND CHALKED IT OFF TO THE FACT SHE\nHAS ALLERGIES. SHE SAID SHE WAS ALLERGIC TO\nDONALD TRUMP WHO WAS ALSO IN THE CLEVELAND AREA AT THE TIME.\nBUT IT IS CLEAR SHE'S KEEPING UP A HARD SCHEDULE.\nSHE DOES HAVE FROM TIME TO TIME THESE LITTLE HEALTH ISSUES THAT\nPOP UP AND ALL IT REALLY DOES IS SORT OF FEED INTO THE CRITICS\nWHO SUGGEST MRS.
