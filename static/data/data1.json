HILLARY CLINTON SEEMED INFIRM\nAND HE WANTED TO SAY HOW LOOK HOW ROBUST I AM.\nTHE WAY HE'S DOING IT IS RAISING QUESTIONS.\nHE WENT ON DAYTIME TALK SHOW DR. OZ AND TALKED TO THE HOST ABOUT\nHIS HEALTH. THE INTERVIEW IS SET TO AIR\nTODAY. WE ALREADY DO KNOW ONE POINT.\nTRUMP USED THAT SAME CONTROVERSIAL DOCTOR, DR.\nBORNSTEEN TO REPORT HIS FINDINGS.\nTHE PRIMARY QUESTION, HOW HEALTHY IS THE 70-YEAR-OLD\nREPUBLICAN NOMINEE? FOR THAT SARAH MARIE IS LIVE IN\nNEW YORK WHERE TRUMP IS SCHEDULED TO SPEAK LATER TODAY.\nWHAT DO WE KNOW? >> WELL, GOOD MORNING, CHRIS.\nLOOK, WE KNOW THAT DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T EXERCISE ALL THAT MUCH.\nWE KNOW HE WANTS TO LOSE ABOUT 15 POUNDS.\nBUT WE DON'T KNOW A WHOLE LOT OF DETAILS AND THAT'S LARGELY\nBECAUSE EVEN THOUGH HE RELEASED THE RESULTS OF HIS RECENT\nPHYSICAL, HE HASN'T MADE THEM PUBLIC.\nHE DID RELY ON A LITTLE REALITY TELEVISION FLARE IN TERMS OF\nREVEALING ON TELEVISION. >> WHY NOT SHARE YOUR MEDICAL\nRECORDS? >> I REALLY HAVE NO PROBLEM IN\nDOING IT. I HAVE IT RIGHT HERE.\nSHOULD I DO IT? I DON'T CARE.\nIT'S TWO LETTERS. ONE IS THE REPORT AND THE OTHER\nIS FROM LENNOX HILL HOSPITAL. >> MAY I SEE THEM?\n>> YEAH, SURE. >> NOW, OF COURSE, ALL OF THIS\nCOMES AS THERE IS A MUCH BIGGER FOCUS ON TRANSPARENCY IN TERMS\nOF THE HEALTH OF BOTH OF THOSE CANDIDATES AND WHILE DONALD\nTRUMP HAS BEEN TAKING A RESPECTFUL TONE WHEN IT COMES TO\nNAVIGATING HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH ISSUES AT THE 9/11\nSERVICE, HE COULDN'T AVOID GETTING IN A DIG WHEN HE WAS\nCAMPAIGNING IN OHIO LAST NIGHT TAKING A SWIPE AT HILLARY\nCLINTON'S STAMINA. >> YOU THINK THIS IS SO EASY.\nIN THIS BEAUTIFUL ROOM THAT IS 122 DEGREES.\nI DON'T KNOW, FOLKS, DO YOU THINK HILLARY WOULD BE ABLE IS\nTO STAND UP HERE FOR AN HOUR AND DO IT?\nI DON'T THINK SO. >> STILL GOING TO BE RELATIVELY\nLIMITED INFORMATION, NOT A COMPLETE MEDICAL HISTORY LIKE\nWE'VE SEEN PREVIOUS NOMINEES PROVIDE.\nTHEY DON'T FEEL THE NEED TO RELEASE MUCH MORE BEYOND THAT.\nTRUMP SWITCHING GEARS ENTIRELY AND HERE AT THE WARDOLF\nHISTORIA. HOW HE IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE\nMANY PLANS HE RUPPROPOSED. >> THANKS FOR THAT REPORTING.\nLET'S DISCUSS EVERYTHING WE LEARNED WITH MARK PRESTON,\n\"WASHINGTON POST\" POLITICAL REPORTER AND DR. SANJAY GUPTA.\nGREAT TO HAVE ALL OF YOU HERE. THERE IS POLITICS AND HEALTH.\nLET ME START WITH YOU, SANJAY, ABOUT HER HEALTH.\nTWO-PAGE LETTER THAT HILLARY CLINTON'S DOCTOR RELEASED.\nFILLED WITH LAB RESULTS AND THE VITAMINS SHE'S ON AND WHAT SHE'S\nNOT DEFICIENT IN. WHAT DID YOU SEE IN READING THIS\nLETTER? >> FIRST OF ALL, IT'S A LETTER.\nIT'S NOT MEDICAL RECORDS. ALL THIS TALK WHETHER MEDICAL\nRECORDS ARE GOING TO BE RELEASED.\nNEITHER ONE HAD MEDICAL RECORDS RELEASED.\nTHE BIGGER THING WAS A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT HAPPENED TO\nTHE RECENT HEALTH EPISODE. THE PNEUMONIA.\nSHE GOT A C.A.T. SCAN TO DIAGNOSE THAT AND PUT ON\nANTIBIOTICS. TEN DAYS OF AN ANTIBIOTIC KNOWN\nAS LEVIQUIN. THROUGHOUT THE YEAR SHE HAD\nSEVERAL SCANS. CT SCAN OF HER SINUSES AND BRAIN\nAND CT SCAN OF HER LUNGS. >> BECAUSE SHE HAS SEASONAL\nALLERGIES AND SISINUSITIS. SOMETIMES YOU'LL DO THAT AND THE\nBRAIN SHOWED NO ABNORMALITIES WHICH IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE GOING\nBACK TO 2012 THERE WAS ALL THESE QUESTIONS WAS THERE SOME SORT OF\nINJURY TO THE BRAIN. THE CT HAS REPORTED NO EVIDENCE\nOF ABNORMALITIES. >> YOU'RE SATISFIED WITH THIS\nLETTER? >> WE'RE READING A SUMMARY OF\nSOMEONE'S INTERPRETATION OF ALL THE MEDICAL RECORDS.\n>> WHAT DO WE USUALLY GET? WHAT ARE WE COMPARING THIS TO AS\nA STANDARD? >> THIS IS TYPICALLY WHAT WE\nGET. IN 2008 JOHN McCAIN RELEASED HIS\nMEDICAL RECORDS ABOUT 1,000 PAGES AND I GOT A CHANCE TO LOOK\nAT THOSE, BUT, TYPICALLY, IT'S A LETTER LIKE THIS AND SOME TYPE\nOF SUMMARY BY A PHYSICIAN WHO HAS BEEN TREATING THE PERSON FOR\nA LONG TIME. >> HOW IS THIS PLAYING\nPOLITICALLY IN TERMS OF WHO LOOKS KN IN THIS AND WHO\nDOESN'T? >> SORT OF HARD TO SAY.\nI LIKE TO LOOK AT THE POLL NUMBERS AND THERE REALLY ISN'T\nPOLLING ON THIS YET. HOW MUCH INFORMATION WE EXPECT\nFROM OUR CANDIDATES. ONE THING THAT WE'RE SEEING OR\nBEING REINFORCED HERE IS A PARTISAN INTERPRETATION TO THAT.\nPEOPLE WHO LIKE DONALD TRUMP THINK HE HAS GIVEN ENOUGH\nINFORMATION ON HIS TAXES AND ENOUGH INFORMATION IN GENERAL\nAND PEOPLE FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHE QUESTION THAT IS REALLY INTERESTING UNDERCUTTING ALL\nTHIS IS WHAT IS THE STANDARD? SHOULD WE GIVE THOUSANDS OF\nPAGES OR IS A LETTER OF A SUMMARY ENOUGH?\nWHETHER SUCH A LETTER IS ENOUGH, PARTICULARLY WHEN THERE IS AN\nACUTE INCIDENT THAT HAPPENS. BUT, I THINK THAT MOSTLY VOTERS\nARE GOING TO LOOK AT THIS THROUGH THE LENS AT WHICH THEY\nLOOK AT THE CANDIDATES, EITHER POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY.\n>> HILLARY HAS THIS DOCTOR WHO, BY ALL ACCOUNTS, IS A REAL\nDOCTOR. TRUMP GOES ON DR. OZ AND, ONCE\nAGAIN, USES HIS DR. BORSTEIN. HE IS CONTROVERSIAL BY ANY\nMEASURE AND HE WROTE A LETTER THAT WAS RIDICULOUS THE FIRST\nTIME PUTTING OUT HIS FINDINGS. SO, THEY DID IT IN DIFFERENT\nWAYS. DOES ANY OF THAT MATTER?\n>> HONESTLY, I DON'T REALLY THINK SO.\nIF YOU ASK SOMEONE WHO IS A FERVENT TRUMP SUPPORTER HOW THEY\nFEEL ABOUT THE LETTER, THEY WOULD DISAGREE WITH YOUR\nASSESSMENT. A LOT OF OPRAISES IN THERE.\n>> THAT ENDS THE ANALYSIS OF THE LETTER.\nDOCTORS DON'T WRITE HYPERBOLIC LETTERS THAT ARE FILLED WITH\nCRAZY ASSESSMENTS OF WHAT SOMEBODY'S SUPREME HEALTH IS.\n>> SURE. >> DOESN'T MATTER HOW YOU FEEL\nABOUT IT. THAT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT DR.\nSANJAY GUPTA DOES IN A REAL LETTER ABOUT ANYTHING.\nAM I WRONG ABOUT THIS? >> LACKED IN OBJECTIVE DATA, AS\nWELL. IT DIDN'T HAVE SOME SIMPLE\nOBJECTIVE DATA THAT YOU WOULD LOOK AT FOR SOMEONE'S RISK OF\nHEART DISEASE AND DIFFERENT THINGS.\n>> DR. TRUMP'S HEALTH AND IT WAS NOT A REAL DISCLOSURE OF HIS\nMEDICAL RECORDS. HE HAD IN HIS POCKET ONE-PAGE\nLETTER THAT HE REVEALED ON DR. OZ AND DR. OZ GOT TO TAKE A LOOK\nAT. SO, DOES THAT POLITICALLY ANSWER\nANY LINGERING QUESTIONS? >> NO.\nLOOK, PHILIP IS RIGHT. WHAT A MADE FOR TV MOMENT WHEN\nHE SITS DOWN AND TELLS DR. OZ, WE'RE NOT GOING TO DISCUSS\nSPECIFICS OR SPECIFICS ABOUT IT AND SITS DOWN AND PULLS OUT THE\nPIECE -- LOOK WHAT I HAVE IN MY HAND HERE.\n>> IT'S GOOD TV. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT POLITICS.\nTHE POLITICS OF IT, THOUGH, HE IS TRYING TO REACH A\nCONSTITUENCY THAT HE'S NOT DOING GREAT WITH NOW.\nTHAT IS WOMEN. HE'S DOING WELL WITH MARRIED\nWOMEN, BUT NOT DOING WELL WITH SINGLE WOMEN.\nSO, WHEN HE GOES ON DR. OZ, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A\nCONSTITUENCY OF VIEWERSHIP THAT IS LARGELY COMPRISED OF WOMEN.\nTHAT'S WHY HE DID THAT. AND, GUESS WHAT, WE'RE GOING TO\nBE TALKING ABOUT IT ALL DAY TODAY, AS WELL.\nTO HIS POINT, HE THINKS THAT HE IS NOT ONLY HITTING THAT\nCONSTITUENCY, BUT HITTING THE MAIN STREAM MEDIA.\nIT IS WORTH NOTING, THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME THAT WE'VE HAD A\nPOLITICIAN GO ON A PROGRAM THAT IS NOT MAIN STREAM MEDIA\nNECESSARILY, RIGHT? WE'VE SEEN THE OBAMAS DO IT ALL\nTHROUGH -- >> CLINTON JUST WENT ON KIMMEL\nYOU KNOW IN THIS FIRST BRUSH ABOUT HEALTH AND SHE WAS JOKING\nABOUT IT. >> THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT\nVENUES, BUT CLEARLY A STUNT. >> HERE IS A MOMENT FROM DR. OZ\nAND DONALD TRUMP'S EXCHANGE. WATCH THIS.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT STAMINA. YOU USE THAT WORD A LOT.\nYOU MADE IT AN ISSUE IN THIS CAMPAIGN.\nYOU ARGUE THAT A PRESIDENT HAS TO HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF\nSTAMINA. IF ELECTED AT AGE 70 YOU WILL BE\nTHE OLDEST PERSON TO EVER ENTER THE OVAL OFFICE.\nWHY DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE THE STAMINA FOR THE JOB?\n>> JUST ABOUT THE SAME AGE AS RONALD REAGAN AND HILLARY IS A\nYEAR BEHIND ME. JUST BASED ON MY LIFE, I\nACTUALLY, I DON'T KNOW IF THIS MAKES SENSE, I FEEL AS GOOD\nTODAY AS I DID WHEN I WAS 30. >> SANJAY, WHAT ELSE WAS\nREVEALED ON THE SHOW ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S HEALTH?\n>> FIRST, I WISH I FELT AS GOOD AS I DID WHEN I WAS 30.\nWE'RE GOING TO, OBVIOUSLY, SEE THE FULL SHOW WHEN HE HAS THE\nRESULTS RELEASED LATER TODAY. I TALKED TO DR. OZ YESTERDAY AND\nASKED ABOUT THIS. ONE THING HE ZEROED IN ON WAS\nHEART. DR. OZ IS A HEART SURGEON.\nHE HAD A CT OF HIS HEART LOOKING FOR CALCIUM.\nTHAT LOOKED GOOD. ALSO AN ECOCARDIOGRAM OF HIS\nHEART AND VARIOUS LAB TESTS. HOW DR. OZ SORT OF SUMMARIZED IT\nFOR ME IS HE SAID THOSE TESTS ALL LOOK GOOD FOR A MAN OF HIS\nAGE. >> HIS WEIGHT WAS A QUESTION.\n>> HIS WEIGHT IS A QUESTION BECAUSE WE'RE NOT EXACTLY SURE\nWHAT HIS WEIGHT IS I HEARD 236 AND I HEARD 267 AND AUDIENCE\nMEMBERS HEARD THAT AND HE IS 6'3\" IN HEIGHT.\n>> THAT WOULD BE OVERWEIGHT. IF IT WERE 267 AND HE'S 6'2\" OR\n6'3\", HE WOULD BE OOBESE. >> BMI OF ANYTHING OVER 30 IS\nCONSIDERED OBESE. IF HE WAS 236 HE WOULD BE\nOVERWEIGHT. >> NOW, WE ALL RESPECT THE\nMEDICAL PROFESSION VERY MUCH, BUT THESE NUMBERS THAT WE'RE\nGETTING FROM THEM, WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE THAT THESE ARE THE\nNUMBERS, RIGHT? BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GETTING ANY\nRAW MATERIAL. HOW MUCH SKEPTICISM DO YOU FEEL\nCOMFORTABLE PUTTING INTO THIS? THIS ISN'T AN ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTHAT HAS FORENSICALLY GONE OVER DATA.\nDOCTORS WHO SANJAY HAS SAID IN THE PAST, A CULIE COLIEGEALITY .\nHOW MUCH BACKUP SHOULD WE ASK FOR WHEN WE HAVE NOT GOTTEN\nBACKUP BEFORE EXCEPT FOR McCAIN? >> I THINK THE QUESTION HERE IS\nA FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION OF BOTH TRUST OF THE CANDIDATE TO, YOU\nKNOW, A SECONDARY DEGREE TRUST TO THE PEOPLE THEY'RE HIRING TO\nPROVIDE THE INFORMATION. THAT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL\nQUESTION. IF YOU THINK DONALD TRUMP IS\nSOMEONE WHO SAYS HE WEIGHS 236 POUNDS INSTEAD OF 267.\nHE COULD STAND ON A SCALE -- >> THAT IS A DIFFERENT SHOW.\nTHAT IS \"THE BIGGEST LOSER\" SHOW.\n>> HE WOULD NEVER BE ON THAT SHOW.\nJUST THE TITLE ALONE. >> SO MANY QUESTIONS IN THIS\nCAMPAIGN WHERE WE HAVE TO TAKE THE CANDIDATES ON TRUST.\nMORE OF AN ISSUE THIS YEAR THAN WE HAVE SEEN IN PAST CAMPAIGNS\nBECAUSE SO MUCH OF THIS CAMPAIGN HAS QUESTIONED THE EXTENT TO\nWHICH WE CAN TRUST CANDIDATES IN GENERAL, MUCH LESS THESE TWO\nCANDIDATES. >> HE'S PLAYING TO AN ADVANTAGE\nHERE ANY WAY YOU LOOK AT IT. HILLARY CLINTON HAD THE EPISODE\nWHERE SHE FAINTED AND FELL ON TO THAT VAN.\nSHE HAD THE 2012 EPISODE AND NOT HIM.\nNEVER A CHECK ON HIS HEALTH. HE EATS McDONALD'S AND RUNS\nAROUND LIKE A MACHINE. >> THEY BOTH RUN AROUND LIKE A\nMACHINE IN TERMS OF THEIR STAMINA.\nI'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH VOTERS WANT TO HEAR ABOUT COLONOSCOPY\nRESULTS. >> ALL DAY.\n>> I LOOK AT THOSE IN MY FREE TIME.\nFORGET ABOUT WORK TIME. >>> DONALD TRUMP IS NOW ON TOP\nIN SEVERAL BATTLEGROUND STATE",

YOU\nARGUE THE PRESIDENT HAS TO HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF STAMINA.\nIF ELECTED AT AGE 70 YOU WOULD BE THE OLDEST PERSON TO ENTER\nTHE OVAL OFFICE.

AGAIN, FOR PEOPLE WATCHING ALL\nDAY IT WASN'T JUST THAT HE WENT ON.\nIT WAS WE HEARD FROM PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE AND ONLY PEOPLE IN\nTHIS AUDIENCE WE ARE TOLD, DONALD TRUMP'S WEIGHT AND WHAT\nDRUGS. >> HE WANTED TO LOSE WEIGHT\nAPPARENTLY. >> IT IS UNUSUAL.\n>> I WOULD SAY. >> THE QUESTION IS UNUSUAL OR\nUNACCEPTABLE? >> WE HAVE LIVED THERE I THIS\nCAMPAIGN WHERE THE UNACCEPTABLE HAS BECOME ACCEPTABLE.\nTHIS CAMPAIGN IS DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING ANY OF US HAVE EVER\nSEEN. THIS IS VERY TRUMPIAN TO DO\nTHIS. DONALD TRUMP WAS THE HOST OF THE\nREALITY TV SHOW. GOING ON A REALITY TV SHOW AND\nREACHING A WIDE AUDIENCE HE WANTED TO REACH, WOMEN VIEWERS\nIN PARTICULAR, IF YOU WANT TO CUT DOWN THE DEMOGRAPHIC OF THE\nAUDIENCE IS NOT A DUMB THING FOR DONALD TRUMP TO DO IF HE WANTS\nTO TALK TO WOMEN AND SAY, OKAY, I JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE MY HEALTH\nNUMBERS HERE. WHY DON'T YOU LOOK AT THEM,\nDR. OZ AND TELL US WHAT YOU THINK.\nI THINK FROM MY PERSPECTIVE OF A POLITICAL JOURNALIST THAT'S BEEN\nAROUND THIS IS THE STRANGEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN, BUT IN\nTHIS CAMPAIGN AND WITH THIS CANDIDATE, SOMEHOW IT SEEMS TO\nBE PART OF HIS MOW SAMOSAIC. >> WRITING NEW STORIES THAT ARE\n2500 WORDS LONG, IN DEPTH STORIES, TALKING TO THE C\nCANDIDATE AND HIS DOCTOR. DONALD TRUMP, THE CLASSIC\nSHOWMAN,ER REALITY INTERTV ENTERTAINER.\nALL ABOUT CROWD WORK AND KNOWING HIS AUDIENCE ABOUT HOW TO SPIN\nIT. HE GOES ON DR. OZ AND DOES THIS\nTHING, SHOULD I SHOW IT? YOU WANT TO SEE IT?\nIT IS CLASSIC TRUMP BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY HE IS TALKING TO\nA DOCTOR ABOUT HIS HEALTH. HILLARY CLINTON IS YET TO DO\nTHAT IN TERMS OF A DOCTOR",

IT'S ANOTHER LETTER SIMILAR TO\nTHE LETTER IN JULY OF LAST YEAR. IT'S GOT MORE DETAIL, DON IT.\nTALKS A FAIR AMOUNT ABOUT THIS RECENT EPISODE WITH PNEUMONIA\nAND TALKS ABOUT THE FACT SHE HAD A CAT SCAN FOR THE PNEUMONIA AND\nT ANTIBIOTICS AND FOR VARIOUS\nREASONS SHE'S HAD A CAT SCAN OF HER LUNGS AND A SCAN OF HER\nHEART AND HER BRAIN. THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE BACK IN\n2012, SHE HAD THIS INJURY TO HER HEAD -- PARDON ME -- I GUESS\nIT'S GOING AROUND. >> ARE YOU GOOD?\n>> THANKS. >> DR.

WE'RE RANKING QUITE A BIT ONE OF\nTHE MOST COMMON ILLNESSES AND IT'S BEEN HANDLED PERFECTLY\nWELL. >> I GOT AN E-MAIL FROM THE\nFORMER HEAD COACH OF LSU, SAYING I HEARD PEOPLE ON YOUR SHOW\nTALKING ABOUT PNEUMONIA AS IF IT'S A COLD.\nI THOUGHT IT WAS SOMETHING THAT'S EXTREMELY SERIOUS.\nHE DIDN'T REALIZE HOW COMMON IT IS FOR SOMEONE TO HAVE\nPNEUMONIA. >> IT CAN BE SERIOUS, TO BE\nFAIR, RIGHT? >> OF COURSE.\n>> PEOPLE CAN END UP IN INTENSIVE CARE, BUT THERE'S\nPNEUMONIA, AND CAN THERE'S PNEUMONIA, PEOPLE REFER\nCOLOQUIALLY TO THE WALKING PNEUMONIA.\nTHE OTHER KEY THING ABOUT THIS, LISA BARDOCK IS A VERY WELL\nTRAINED PHYSICIAN TAKING ABSOLUTELY PERFECT CARE AND IF\nYOU LOOK, SANJAY MENTIONED THE LETTER FROM 2015, THE NEXT\nLETTER FROM A FEW DAYS -- FROM TODAY, ACTUALLY AND WHAT WE SEE\nIS A VERY COMPETENT DESCRIPTION OF A PERSON WHO HAS BEEN\nTHOROUGHLY TAKEN CARE OF, CONTRASTING THAT TO WHATEVER\nTHAT PIECE OF PAPER WAS THAT DONALD TRUMP SHOWED THAT\nINDICATED SOMEHOW HE HAD A MEDICAL EXAMPLE.\n>> WE'RE GOING TO GET TO DONALD TRUMP.\n>> I CAN'T WAIT. >> FROM DR. BARDOCK, SHE\nINDICATES THIS SCAN HILLARY CLINTON HAD, BECAUSE.\nSINUS INFECTION IN 2012, I WOULD IMAGINE.\nGIVEN ALL OF THESE CONSPIRACY THEORIES IN THE FALL OF 2012,\nDOES THIS SETTLE ANY EVENT, THE BRAIN SCAN?\n>> THE CONSPIRACY THEORY HAD NO MERIT BUT TO THE EXTENT PEOPLE\nWANT TO SAY LOOK IS THERE AN UPDATED CAT SCAN OR SOME SORT OF\nIMAGING OF HER BRAIN, WAS THERE SOME BLEED OR SOMETHING LIKE\nTHAT, THAT OCCURRED OR WHATEVER, AND THAT WAS I GUESS PART OF\nTHESE CONSPIRACY THEORY. I'M LOOKING AT A REPORT, AND\nWHAT THEY SAID WAS THERE WAS NO ABNORMALITIES FOUND ON THE CAT\nSCAN OF THE BRAIN. >> AND THE OTHER THING IS JUST\nWATCHING HILLARY IN ACTION, THERE'S NOT A SCLEHRED SHE'S\nANYTHING OTHER THAN ON TOP OF HER GAME.\nI REMEMBER WHEN RUDE I GIULIANI ANNOUNCED SOME SPECIAL SITUATION\nSHE HAD. SHE HAD SPOKES PEOPLE TRYING TO\nDEFEND HER MEDICAL SITUATION OR ATTACK IT AND IT'S JUST OFF THE\nWALL. >> IF YOU LOOK AT THE VIDEO\nSUNDAY, EVEN BEFORE THE VIDEO, YOU COULD SEE HER WALKING.\nSHE APPEARED TO BE -- THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG, SHE WASN'T\nON TOP OF HER GAME. BUT HERE THIS LOOKS VERY, VERY\nDIS DISTURBING.\n>> IT IS DISTURBING BUT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU GET\nDEHYDRATED AND YOU HAVE A FEBRILE INCIDENT OR YOU'RE IN\nTHE HEAT, THIS CAN HAPPEN. THIS HAPPENED TO ME.\nI THINK SHE RECOVERED VERY QUICKLY FROM THIS AND THERE'S NO\nEVIDENCE AFTER A VERY THROUGH EXAM BY A HIGHLY COMPETENT\nPHYSICIAN SHE'S GOT ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT HER DOCTOR AND\nSHE HAVE BEEN SAYING. SHE HAD FEVER, PNEUMONIA, BACK\nON THE ROAD. >> NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT DONALD\nTRUMP, IN THE TRUMP-IEST OF WAYS, THIS MORNING, WHAT DOES IT\nTELL YOU? >> WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING YET.\nIT WAS PRETTY THEATRICAL, WE DO KNOW THAT.\n>> DID YOU SPEAK TO DR. OZ? >> I SPOKE TO DR. OZ TODAY.\nDR. OZ IS A HEART SURGEON, A WELL-\nWELL-REGARDED CARDIAC SURGERY, I ASKED HIM SPECIFICALLY WERE\nTHERE ANY CONCERNS. HE SAID SPECIFICALLY THERE WERE\nREPORTS HE HAD SEEN INCLUDING A CT SCAN OF THE HEART, AN ECHO\nC CARDIOGRAM OF THE HEART, AND I\nSAID WERE YOU CONCERNED AND HE SAID EVERYTHING LOOKED GOOD FOR\nA MAN OF HIS AGE, AND HE HAD NO CONCERNS.\nIF YOU BRING THAT UP, THE HEART IS ONE AREA THAT YOU'D FOCUS IN\nON CERTAINLY AND AT LEAST FROM DR. OZ'S PERSPECTIVE\nINTERPRETING THE RESULTS THAT WERE HANDED TO HIM BY ANOTHER\nDOCTOR WHO INTERPRETED THE RESULTS, HE WAS NOT CONCERNED.\n>> HE PROVIDED A ONE -- A BRIEF ONE-PAGE MEDICAL RECORD.\nBEFORE YOU RESPOND, LET'S WATCH. >> WHY NOT SHARE YOUR MEDICAL\nRECORDS? >> I HAVE REALLY NO PROBLEM IN\nDOING IT. I HAVE IT RIGHT HERE.\nSHOULD I DO IT? I DON'T CARE.\n[ APPLAUSE ] SHOULD I DO IT?\nIT'S -- IT'S TWO LETTERS, ONE IS THE REPORT AND THE OTHER IS FROM\nLENNOX HILL HOSPITAL. >> MAY I SEE THEM?\n>> YEAH, SURE. >> THOSE WERE THE REPORTS\nFROM -- THESE WERE ALL THE TESTS JUST DONE.\n>> WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF HIM REVEALING HIS MEDICAL RECORDS IN\nTHIS FORMAT? >> IT'S HIGHLY UNUSUAL.\n>> CAN YOU CALL IT MEDICAL RECORDS?\n>> I WOULDN'T CALL IT ANY OTHER OTHER THAN A PIECE OF PAPER.\nIT CAN BE THE SAME RHETORIC IN THE ORIGINAL LETTER SUPPOSEDLY\nFROM HIS PRIVATE DOCTOR. BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF\nIT AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT DR. OZ WAS THINKING AS HE WAS HANDED\nTHIS PIECE OF PAPER. LET'S JUST ASSUME HE'S TRYING TO\nMAKE THE BEST OF IT. I THINK WE DON'T KNOW MUCH MORE\nTHAN BEFORE. I DO WANT TO POINT OUT, DON,\nWHAT WE REALLY WANT TO KNOW ABOUT A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT,\nDO YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO IMPAIR YOUR ABILITY TO\nFULFILL THIS? DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING THAT IS\nKIND OF A MEDICAL TIME BOMB THAT'S GOING TO IMPAIR YOUR\nABILITY TO FUNCTION, TO MAKE THE DECISION YOU NEED TO MAKE AND\nALL OF THAT? I THINK PROBABLY NEITHER\nCANDIDATE DOES. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IS IN TRUMP'S\nRECORDS BUT LET'S ASSUME THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THIS, THERE'S NO\nTIME BOMB IN THERE, THERE CERTAINLY ISN'T ANY IN HILLARY\nCLINTON'S RECORDS. I THINK WE NEED TO MOVE ON AND\nSTOP TALKING ABOUT THEIR MEDICAL ISSUES AND TALK ABOUT THE\nAMERICAN PEOPLE'SPEOPLE'S ISSUE. LET'S STOP THIS BACK AND FORTH\nWITH HILLARY AND I DON'T CARE THAT MUCH ABOUT TRUMP'S MEDICAL\nRECORD. I DO CARE ABOUT WHAT HE'S\nSAYING -- WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO FOR HEALTH OF AMERICANS AND THE\nHEALTHCARE SYSTEM. >> IF YOU ALLOW US ONE MORE\nQUESTION, HE SAID TODAY THAT HE FEELS THE SAME AS IF HE WAS 30\nYEARS OLD, LET'S LISTEN TO THIS. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT STAMINA.\nYOU USED THAT WORD A LOT AND YOU ARGUE THE PRESIDENT HAS TO HAVE\nA TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF STAMINA. IF ELECTED AT AGE 70 YOU WOULD\nBE THE OLDEST PERSON TO ENTER THE OVAL OFFICE .\nWHY DO YOU HAVE THE STAMINA? >> JUST ABOUT THE SAME AGE AS\nRONALD REAGAN AND HILLARY IS A YEAR BEHIND ME.\nI WOULD SAY JUST BASED ON MY LIFE.\nI'VE HAD -- I ACTUALLY -- AND I DON'T KNOW IF THIS MAKES SENSE,\nI FEEL AS GOOD TODAY AS I DID WHEN I WAS 30.\n>> HE'S 6'3\" TALL, HE WEIGHS 236 POUNDS ALTHOUGH FROM THE\nAUDIENCE, AND DURING THE TAPING HE SAID 2267 POUNDS.\nTHE DESIRED WEIGHT IS 152 TO 199, 200 TO 239 IS OVER WEIGHT\nIF HE'S 267, THAT WOULD BE OBESE FROM 240 TO 311 POUNDS SO WHAT\nDO YOU MAKE OF THAT? [ LAUGHTER ]\n>> I'M WITH ERWIN ON THIS. HE SAYS HE FEELS LIKE HE'S 30\nYEARS OLD, WHO KNOWS. I WISH I FELT LIKE I WAS 30\nYEARS OLD. TO ERWIN'S POINT, THERE'S\nCERTAIN THINGS YOU'RE LOOKING FOR TO FIND IF SOMEONE IS FIT TO\nLEAD, DO THEY HAVE A COGNITIVE DISFUNCTION, DO THEY HAVE\nDEMENTIA, OR MUSK LOW CULOSKELE. I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE ANY OF\nTHOSE TYPES OF CONDITIONS. IT WOULD BE NICE TO SEE THOSE\nRECORDS, BECAUSE SOME TIMES YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW.\nAND NEVERTHELESS WE'VE SEEN THEM FOR THE LAST 18 MONTHS AND THEY\nSEEM LIKE THEY'RE FINE. >> IS THIS ADDING FURTHER STIGMA\nTO PEOPLE WHO HAVE ILLNESSES? IT'S INTERESTING TO ME BECAUSE I\nKNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SICK, AND IT FEELS LIKE, YOU\nKNOW, IT'S TERRIBLE THAT YOU MAY HAVE TO TAKE A CHOLESTEROL\nMEDICATION. >> YEAH, YEAH.\n>> MILLIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE TO DO THAT.\nWHY ARE THEY STIGMATIZING SOMEONE WHO MAY HAVE A COMMON\nILLNESS SOME. >> IT'S RIDICULOUS.\nI'VE KNOWN HILLARY CLINTON SINCE 1990 AND WORKED WITH HER IN 93\nAND WATCHED HER IN THE SENATE. I'VE NEVER SEEN A MORE\nHARD-WORKING PERSON WITH AS MUCH STAMINA.\n>> I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT THIS UP. YOU CAN HAVE SOME OF THESE\nILLNESSES AND RECOVER WELL AND STILL BE ABLE TO HAVE A VERY\nFUNCTIONAL LIFE. WE SHOULD NOT BE STIGMATIZING.\n>> I PERSONALLY TESTIFIED TO THAT, SANJAY.\n>> I APPRECIATE IT DOCTOR.",

WE DIDN'T FIND OUT UNTIL SUNDAY\nWHEN YOU SAW THAT VIDEO YOU JUST PLAYED THAT SE HAD BEEN\nDIAGNOSED ON FRIDAY AND SHE'D SPENT THE WEEK PRIOR BEING MORE\nACCESSIBLE TO REPORTERS WITH THIS SORT OF TRYING TO CREATE\nMORE OF AN AIR OF TRANSPARENCY. SO SHE REALLY UNDERCUT HERSELF.\nSO HER CAMPAIGN TRYING TO MAKE SOME AEMDS THERE.\nPUTTING OUT SOME INFORMATION PEOPLE WERE DEMANDING.\nA COUPLE THINGS WE LEARNED THAT WERE INTERESTING, ONE WAS THAT\nSHE HAD HAD SYMPTOMS A WEEK PRIOR TO HER PNEUMONIA\nDIAGNOSIS. SO A FULL NINE DAYS BEFORE WE\nFOUND OUT. THAT SHE WAS AND THEN WE ALSO\nLEARNED THAT BACK IN JANUARY SHE HAD HAD SINUSITIS AND AN EAR\nINFECTION THAT GOT BAD ENOUGH WITH FLUID IN HER EAR THAT SHE\nHAD TO HAVE A TUBE INSERTED INTO HER LEFT EAR.\nTHAT IS LEAD UP TO THE IOWA CAUCUSES FULL STEAM AHEAD ON THE\nCAMPAIGN TRAIL AND SHE WENT THROUGH THAT.\nALL OF THIS INFORMATION COMING OUT BRINGS HER TO THE STANDARD\nOF MITT ROMNEY AND BARACK OBAMA IN 2012.\nNOT CERTAINLY TO THE STANDARD OF JOHN McCAIN WHERE REH EHNEHE RE\nPAGES OF MEDICAL RECORDS. BUT SHE HAS A LOT MORE OUT THERE\nTHAN DONALD TRUMP AND WE'VE KNOWN A LOT MORE ABOUT HER\nMEDICAL HISTORY OVER THE LAST YEAR THAN DONALD TRUMP.\nA DEEP VAIN THROMBOSIS. AND THE 2012 CONCUSSION SHE\nSUFFERED AFTER FAINTING THAT LED TO THE BLOOD CLOT BETWEEN HER\nSKULL AND BRAIN. >> DR. SANJAY GUPTA JOINS US\nNOW. AN EVALUATION OF WHAT YOU\nLEARNED. >> WE GOT A MUCH BETTER\nEXPLANATION AS BRIANNA SAID ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED OVER THE\nPAST FEW DAYS. THIS PNEUMONIA THAT WAS\nDIAGNOSED BY A CAT SCAN AS WELL. THIS YEAR IT IS INTERESTING\nSHE'S HAD A SCAN OF HER BRAIN, HER LUNGS AND OF HER HEART AS\nWELL. SHE HAS A HISTORY OF HEART\nDISEASE IN HER FAMILY. AND ALL THOSE LOOKED GOOD.\nKNOWING THAT HER BRAIN SCAN NOW LOOKS GOOD WAS AN IMPORTANT\nPOINT AFTER THE CONCUSSION. THIS IS NOT A FULL RELEASE OF\nMEDICAL RECORDS BY BIANY MEANS BUT AS BRIANNA SAID THIS IS MORE\nTHAN WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST AND CERTAINLY MORE THAN WE'VE SEEN\nFROM MR. TRUMP. >> AND ON THAT NOTE, TONIGHT WE\nARE LEARNING SOME NEW INFORMATION ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S\nHEALTH. BECAUSE HE GAVE THE RESULTS OF\nHIS RECENT PHYSICAL TO TV'S DR. OZ DURING A TAPED INTERVIEW.\nDR. OZ TELLING NBC NEWS HE WAS ACTUALLY CAUGHT OFF GUARD BY\nWHAT TRUMP REVEALED. HE DIDN'T EXPECT DONALD TRUMP TO\nHAND HIM THAT SHEET OF PAPER WITH THE DETAILS.\nHERE IS HOW HE PUT IT. >> I WAS, YOU KNOW, SURPRISED.\nI LOOKED AT THEM AND TRY TO PROCESS IT PRETTY QUICKLY.\nAND IF I WAS A DOCTOR, IF HE WAS MY PATIENT ARE THEY ARE GOOD FOR\nA MAN OF HIS AGE. >> WHAT DID IT SAID.\n>> DETAILS FROM A COLONOSCOPY HE HAD A FEW YEARS AGO.\nA CALCIUM SCAN OF HIS HEART THAT WAS DONE THAT LOOKED GOOD.\nHE HAD RESULTS FROM CHEST X-RAIES AND EKGS AND THE LABOTT\nRESULTS FROM LAST WEEK. >> TYPICALLY NOT THE WAY WE SEE\nCANDIDATES RELEASE THAT KIND OF INFORMATION AND THE DRAMA REALLY\nHEIGHTENED THIS MORNING BECAUSE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN SAYING NO\nTRUMP IS NOT GOING TO RELEASE THE RESULTS OF HIS PHYSICAL\nTODAY ON THE DR. OZ SHOW AND HEENEDED UP DOING JUST THAT,\nPULLING IT OUT OF HIS POCKET AND GIVING IT TO DR. OZ.\nTHIS IS JUST A ONE-PAGE SUMMARY OF THE PHYSICAL THAT HE HAD LAST\nWEEK. AND IT HAS NOT YET BEEN PUBLICLY\nRELEASED. THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN SAYS THEY\nWILL GET TO THAT TOMORROW. THEY LIKELY WILL RELEASE THAT\nTOMORROW. BUT CNN WAS OUTSIDE OF THE SHOW.\nWE TALKED TO MANY AUDIENCE MEMBERS WHO WERE INSIDE FOR THE\nTAPING AND -- SMALL PICTURE OF WHAT DONALD TRUMP'S HEALTH\nREALLY LOOKS LIKE. -- AUDIENCE MEMBER WHO SAYS SHE\nWEIGHS 236 POUNDS. HE SAYS HE DOES NOT EXERCISE AND\nTHAT HE WOULD LIKE TO LOSE BETWEEN 15 AND 20 POUNDS AND HE\nIS ON STATINS, DRUGS THAT HELP LOWER CHOLESTEROL LEVELS.\nTOMORROW WHEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS ANTICIPATED TO RELEASE THIS\nMEDICAL SUMMARY FROM HIS POSITION, IT SHOULD BE NOTED\nTHAT THIS STILL IS NOT ONE THE RESULT OF WHAT THAT PHYSICAL WAS\nLIKE BUT TWO NOT A FULL DISCLOSURE OF HIS MEDICAL\nHISTORY AND DOCUMENTS THAT WOULD BE MORE IN LINE WITH PREVIOUS\nPRESIDENTIAL NOMINEES. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nAND OUT FRONT NOW, PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FORMER DOCTOR.\nAND -- MAGGIE, JUST IN TERMS OF STYLE\nTODAY. YOU GET THE LETTER AND THE LIST\nOF THINGS FROM HILLARY CLINTON TODAY.\nDONALD TRUMP GOING OUT ON DR. OZ, AND I'VE GOT IT.\nHERE IT IS. AND NOW EVEN NOW WE'RE NOT\nGETTING THE FORMAL RESULTS PUBLICLY TILL TOMORROW.\n>> WHAT HAVE WE GOT? WE KNOW WHAT HE WEIGHS.\nTHAT IS THE NEW THING WE LEARNED.\nWE KNEW HE WAS ON STATIN BEFORE, A FORM OF, FROM THE VERY UNUSUAL\nLETTER HIS DOCTOR WROTE A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO.\nWE ALSO KNOW FROM THAT NOTE THAT THE DOCTOR SAID IN THAT LETTER\nTHAT TRUMP HAD LOST 15 POUNDS OVER THE PREVIOUS YEAR.\nI DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS TRUMP WEIGHED BEFORE.\nI DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS NOW.\nHE DID THIS WITH HIS USUAL STYLE.\nHE WASN'T GOING TO RELIES T. HE IS GOING TO RELIES IT.\nTHAT OBSCURES THE FACT THIS IS STILL A PRETTY LOW LEVEL OF\nDISCLOSURE FOR A PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE.\nAND I DON'T KNOW HOICH MORE WE'RE GOING SEE WHEN THEY MAKE\nTHE RELEASE LATER THIS WEEK. >> AND SANJAY, IN TERMS OF WHAT\nWE'RE GOING TO GET, ONE COULD PRESUME THE THINGS THAT WERE\nDISCUSSED IN THIS INTERVIEW WITH DR. OZ, CHOLESTEROL, STATINS,\nBLOOD PRESSURE, BUT WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE WHAT ELSE.\n>> AND I TALKED TO DR. OZ A LITTLE TODAY AS WELL.\nAND YOU HEARD HIM TALK ABOUT. HE'S A CARDIO THORACIC SURGEON\nSO CERTAINLY SOMETHING HE WAS LOOKING FOR WAS A HEART.\nAND EKGS AND THE CONNECTICUT -- CT SCAN OF THE HEART.\nTHOSE COULD BE IMPORTANT TESTS TO RELAY ANY CONCERNS ABOUT\nHEART DISEASE. >> WHEN HE ADMITS HE DOESN'T\nEXERCISE AND HE'S OVERWEIGHT. >> AND A STATIN DRUG.\nAND THAT IS WHAT YOU WOULD REALLY WANT TO ZERO O IN ON.\n>> AND DOCTOR, FIRST OF ALL, YOU ARE SUPPORTING HILLARY CLINTON.\nBUT YOU HAVE TOLD ME ON THE SHOW THAT YOU WANTED A FULL\nNEUROLOGICAL EXAM. YOU WANTED THOSE RESULTS.\nOBVIOUSLY WE'RE NOT GETTING A FULL MEDICAL HISTORY HERE IN\nEITHER CASE. WE CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE THAT ON\nTHE NEURALLOGICAL SIDE. ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH WHAT YOU\nNOW HAVE. >> I WAS VERY IMPRESSED SHE GOT\nA CT SCAN. BY THAT ALONE I'M VERY IMPRESSED\nWITH HER DOCTOR. BUT I THINK BOTH KLDS SHOULD\nHAVE WHAT WE CALL NEUROPSYCHOLOGIC TESTING.\n-- BOTH CANDIDATES. I THINK SHE NEEDS\nNEUROPSYCHOLOGIC TESTING JUST TO SEE THERE'S NO NEUROLOGIC\nSEQUELAE FROM HER INJURY. AND TRUMP I THINK NEEDS A\nNEUROPSYCHOLOGIC BECAUSE OF HIS ERRATIC BEHAVIOR.\nIF SOMEBODY CAME INTO MY OFFICE WITH THAT KIND OF -- THE KIND OF\nTHINGS THAT HE DOES, I WOULD REALLY BE WONDERING ABOUT THE\nPERSONALITY. I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S -- WE KNOW\nHE'S GOT A NARCISSISTIC PERSONALITY DISORDER AT THE VERY\nLEAST. BUT I SOMETIMES WONDER IF HE\nWOULD EVEN BE HYPOMANIC. BUT I THINK PSYCHOLOGIC TESTING\nWOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR HIM. IS SOMETHING I THINK MAYBE\nSHOULD BE FOR ALL CANDIDATES. >> WHEN YOU SAY ALL CANDIDATES\nAND OBVIOUSLY THERE IS SOME SPECULATION IF WHAT THE DOCTOR\nWAS SAYING THERE. GOING THIS IS GOING TO BE THE\nFINAL POINT OF THIS. WE'RE NOT GOING GET A DEEP\nMEDICAL HISTORY FROM EITHER ONE. >> OF COURSE NOT.\nTHERE IS NO LAW THAT REQUIRES ANY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE NEEDS\nTO PUT ANY RECORDS OUT QUITE FRANKLY.\nAS FAR AS ANY KIND OF MENTAL TESTING.\nLAST TIME I THINK WE EVEN SAW THAT WAS BACK IN McGOVERN IN\n'72. AND [INDISCERNIBLE]\n. WHAT WE SAW TODAY WAS A MADE FOR\nTV MOMENT THAT DONALD TRUMP CREATED AND HE DID IT ON A SHOW\nTO TRY TO REACH A CERTAIN VOTER, WHICH WAS WOMEN.\nAND AS MAGGIE SAID, IT WAS A GAME FOR DONALD TRUMP.\n>> BUT THAT IS THE AUDIENCE HE NEEDS TO REACH.\nAND THAT IS THE AUDIENCE OF THAT SHOW.\n>> IT IS THE AUDIENCE HE NEEDS TO REACH IT'S INTERESTING\nBECAUSE WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS A SUMMARY THAT SOMEONE ELSE HAS\nPUT TOGETHER, USUALLY WITH INPUT FROM THE CAMPAIGN OF THE MEDICAL\nRECORDS BY SOMEONE WHO MAY ALSO BE A FRIEND OR AT LEAST HAVE A\nCOLLEGIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CANDIDATE.\nYOU HAVE TO TAKE ALL THAT INTO ACCOUNT.\nPART OF THE REASON YOU ASK FOR THE MEDICAL RECORDS.\nSO YOU CAN GET DISPASSIONATE REVIEW.\nBUT THE POINT IS WE DON'T KNOW EVEN WHAT WE DON'T KNOW.\nNOT TO SUGGEST THERE IS SOMETHING THERE.\nWE DON'T KNOW. THAT IS SORT OF THE POINT.\nI DON'T KNOW THAT WE SHOULD BE MAKING DIAGNOSES, EVEN\nPSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSES FROM ITHE. IT WAS INTERESTING AT THE END OF\nSECRETARY CLINTON'S NOTE THE DOCTOR WROTE \"I BELIEVE HER\nMENTAL HEALTH IS GOOD\". >> SHE'S NOT A PSYCHIATRIST.\n>> RIGHT. >> IN BOTH CASES THEY ARE\nGETTING LETTERS FROM DOCTORS WHO HAVE KNOWN THEM AND WORKED WITH\nTHEM FOR MANY, MANY YEARS.

TWO DAYS LATER, AUGUST 26th, NBC\nNEWS SCORED AN INTERVIEW WITH THAT DOCTOR WHO HAD RELEASED A\nLETTER. IN THAT INTERVIEW, DONALD\nTRUMP'S GASTROINTEROLOGIST SAID THAT HE WROTE THAT LETTER IN\nABOUT FIVE MINUTES WHILE A DONALD TRUMP STAFFER STOOD\nOUTSIDE AND WAITED FOR IT.

OZ WENT ON\nFOX NEWS RADIO AND SAID TRUMP WOULD BE ACTUALLY HANDING OVER\nHIS MEDICAL RECORDS TO DR. OZ, TO THE HOST OF THAT TV SHOW LIVE\nON TV. THE MEDICAL RECORDS WOULD BE\nREVEALED ON TV. THEN INTERESTINGLY THIS MORNING\nTHAT WAS OFF. TRUMP TELLING REPORTERS THEY HAD\nBASICALLY CHANGED THEIR MIND, THEY WOULD NOT BE HANDING OVER\nTHEIR MEDICAL RECORDS OVER ON YOUR TV SHOW.\n>> JOHN ROBERTS JUST REPORTED A LITTLE WHILE AGO THAT HE'S GOING\nTO GO ON DR.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE.\nNO REPORTERS WERE AT IT THE TAPING, NOTHING HAS BEEN\nRELEASED PUBLICLY, WE'RE TOLD THAT WHAT HE HANDED OVER ON TV\nWAS A ONE PAGES MEDICAL SUMMARY FROM OUR OLD FRIEND DR.\nBORNSTEIN. I'M NOT SURE IF THERE ARE JOKES\nIN THIS ONE TOO. WE CAN REPORT THAT THE HOST OF\nTHE TV SHOW, DR. OZ HAD NEVER SEEN THAT DOCUMENT, WHAT WAS IT\nWAS BEFORE DONALD TRUMP HANDED IT TO HIM.\nSO IT'S NOT LIKE HE DID A LOT OF READING ABOUT WHAT HE HAD FOUND.\nIN THEIR VIEW THE WHOLE SPECTACLE DONALD TRUMP HAS\nCREATED ARRANGE THIS WHOLE ISSUE IS IN THAT WORDS RIDICULOUS.\nACCORDING TO THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN, DONALD TRUMP IS,\nQUOTE, MAKING A MOCKERY OF THIS. AND SO, ULTIMATELY, BOTTOM LINE,\nWE HAVE STILL GOT NOTHING. AND MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T CARE.\nBUT THE DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN REMAINS THE ONLY PRESIDENTIAL\nCAMPAIGN IN U.S. HISTORY TO HAVE MADE SUCH A HASH AND SUCH A\nBIZARRE SPECTACLE OUT OF WHAT IS USUALLY A TOTALLY RUN OF THE\nMILL PART OF THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.\nAND THERE'S ALL THESE SERIOUS CONCERNS SWIRLING AROUND THE\nTRUMP FOUNDATION AND HOW TRUTHFUL TRUMP AND HIS CAMPAIGN\nHAVE BEEN ABOUT THAT FOUNDATION AND WHOSE MONEY THAT FOUNDATION\nIS GIVING AWAY ANYWAY. AND WITH THIS NEW DAMMING\nDOCUMENT SITUATION, UNLESS HE DRASTICALLY SERVED HIMSELF FROM\nHIS LIFE EELS WORK AND HIS BUSINESS INTERESTS, TODAY\nBASICALLY GETTING THE HOOK AND GETTING YANKED OFF STAGE IN\nFLINT, MICHIGAN TONIGHT BY THAT PASTOR, IF YOU'RE GOOD AT BEING\nA SHOWMAN, YOU CAN DISTRACT FROM ALL THAT, BY SHOWING A SHOWMAN'S\nSERVICE. A REAL SHOWMAN CAN -- THERE'S\nBEEN NO RELEASE OF INFORMATION ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S HEALTH.\nNOBODY OTHER THAN THAT GUY ON TV HAS SEEN ANYTHING NEW ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP'S HEALTH TODAY, EVEN THOUGH A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE\nCONVINCED THEMSELVES THAT HE'S MADE SOME NEW DISCLOSURE ABOUT\nHIS HEALTH. A GREAT SHOWMAN CAN PICK ANY ONE\nTHING AND BE SO RIDICULOUS ABOUT IT THAT EVERYBODY STOPS WHATEVER\nTHEY WERE PAYING ATTENTION TO BEFORE AND PAYS ATTENTION TO\nTHAT RIDICULOUS CIRCUS INSTEAD, AND NOT ONLY DO WE PAY FOR THE\nPRIVILEGE OF PAYING ATTENTION TO IT.\nTHAT'S WHAT SHOWMANSHIP IS, IT'S A CON, BUT IT'S VERY COMPELLING.\nTHIS IS A WEIRD DAY IN THE NEWS, BUT A LOT OF WHAT HAPPENED IN\nTODAY'S NEWS MAKE ME FEEL LIKE I NEED TO WASH.\nWE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. >> WHY NOT SHARE YOUR MEDICAL\nRECORDS? WHY NOT --\n>> I HAVE NO REAL PROBLEM IN DOING IT.\nI HAVE IT RIGHT HERE?

IT'S JUST -- WE LIKE TO BE\nSYSTEMATIC ABOUT THESE THINGS, WHAT WE KNOW ARE THE MEDICINES\nTHAT HE TAKES, AND FROM THAT YOU CAN INFER WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS\nHE HAS. BUT I THINK WHAT WAS IN THE\nLETTER TODAY WERE SOME RESULTS OF PREVIOUS EKGs, CHEST X RAY,\nCOLONOSCOPY, LABS FROM LAST WEEK, WHICH WERE REPORTEDLY\nNORMAL.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE.\nNO REPORTERS WERE AT IT THE TAPING, NOTHING HAS BEEN\nRELEASED PUBLICLY, WE'RE TOLD THAT WHAT HE HANDED OVER ON TV\nWAS A ONE PAGES MEDICAL SUMMARY FROM OUR OLD FRIEND DR.\nBORNSTEIN. I'M NOT SURE IF THERE ARE JOKES\nIN THIS ONE TOO. WE CAN REPORT THAT THE HOST OF\nTHE TV SHOW, DR. OZ HAD NEVER SEEN THAT DOCUMENT, WHAT WAS IT\nWAS BEFORE DONALD TRUMP HANDED IT TO HIM.\nSO IT'S NOT LIKE HE DID A LOT OF READING ABOUT WHAT HE HAD FOUND.\nIN THEIR VIEW THE WHOLE SPECTACLE DONALD TRUMP HAS\nCREATED ARRANGE THIS WHOLE ISSUE IS IN THAT WORDS RIDICULOUS.\nACCORDING TO THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN, DONALD TRUMP IS,\nQUOTE, MAKING A MOCKERY OF THIS. AND SO, ULTIMATELY, BOTTOM LINE,\nWE HAVE STILL GOT NOTHING. AND MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T CARE.\nBUT THE DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN REMAINS THE ONLY PRESIDENTIAL\nCAMPAIGN IN U.S. HISTORY TO HAVE MADE SUCH A HASH AND SUCH A\nBIZARRE SPECTACLE OUT OF WHAT IS USUALLY A TOTALLY RUN OF THE\nMILL PART OF THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.\nAND THERE'S ALL THESE SERIOUS CONCERNS SWIRLING AROUND THE\nTRUMP FOUNDATION AND HOW TRUTHFUL TRUMP AND HIS CAMPAIGN\nHAVE BEEN ABOUT THAT FOUNDATION AND WHOSE MONEY THAT FOUNDATION\nIS GIVING AWAY ANYWAY.

JUST BASED ON THIS STAGE OF MY\nLIFE. I FEEL AS GOOD TODAY AS I DID\nWHEN I WAS 30. >> OH, WELL, THAT'S TOTALLY\nRESOLVED THEN, DONE AND DUSTED, HOW DO YOU FEEL?\nI FEEL GREAT. REALLY HOW GREAT DO YOU FEEL?\nDONALD TRUMP APPEARING ON A DAYTIME TV SHOW, EARLIER TAPED\nTODAY, IT'S DUE TO AIR TOMORROW. DURING THAT TAPING MR. DONALD\nTRUMP HANDED OVER WHAT HE SAID WERE SOME KIND OF MEDICAL RECORD\nPREPARED BY HIS DOCTOR WHO HE SAYS GAVE HIM A PHYSICAL EXAM\nLAST WEEK. JOINING US NOW IS OUR MEDICAL\nNEWS CONTRIBUTOR. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.\n>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME. >> DID WE ACTUALLY LEARN ANY\nSUBSTANTIVE MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT DONALD TRUMP TODAY OR ARE\nWE SORT OF WAITING FOR A DOCUMENT?\n>> WE'RE STILL WAITING TO ACTUALLY VISUALIZE THE DOCUMENT\nTHAT DR.

IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF\nEITHER CAMPAIGN ALLOWS THEIR DOCTOR TO TAKE QUESTIONS.\nONE THING THEY SAY HILLARY CLINTON SHOULD HAVE DONE WHEN IT\nCAME APPARENT ON SUNDAY SHE WAS SICKER THAN SHE MIGHT HAVE\nTHOUGHT, THAT IF SHE HAD LET HER DOCTOR SPEAK THEN, YOU KNOW,\nTHAT WOULD HAVE REASSURED PEOPLE IN A MORE FUNDAMENTAL WAY THAT,\nINDEED, JUST A CASE OF PNEUMONIA.\nLET'S MOVE ON.

THE COLIN POWELL E-MAILS CAME\nOUT ON DCLEAKS.COM WHICH MANY CYBER SECURITY EXPERTS HAVE\nCONCLUDED HAS TIES TO RUSSIAN ENTITIES.\nI SAY RUSSIAN ENTITIES BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES HAS NEVER SAID\nWHETHER IT BELIEVES THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT IS DOING THIS,\nWHETHER IT IS RUSSIAN PEOPLE ALTHOUGH THERE IS EVIDENCE IT IS\nGOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS IF YOU LOOK AT THE TIMES WHEN THE HACKS\nTAKE PLACE IT APPEARS TO BE DURING THE RUSSIAN WORK DAY.\nIN ANY EVENT THE QUESTION IS WHAT WILL THE UNITED STATES DO\nABOUT IT? WE HAVE BEEN TOLD BY SEVERAL\nOFFICIALS THERE ARE NO CRIMINAL CHARGES IMMINENT HERE.\nWE DON'T EXPECT CHARGES TO BE FILED AGAINST THE RUSSIAN\nENTITIES BUT WILL THE UNITED STATES PUBLICALLY SAY THAT THEY\nBELIEVE THE RUSSIANS ARE BEHIND IT?\nTHEY HAVE NEVER SAID IT. WILL THERE BE A SHAMING THING?\nWILL THERE BE SOME GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT EXCHANGE ABOUT THIS?\nTHAT'S THE LARGER QUESTION ABOUT WHICH THERE APPEARS TO BE NO\nANSWER NOW. >> AT THE SAME TIME, WE DO KNOW\nFROM AN INTERVIEW I DID AND FROM OTHER CONVERSATIONS THAT YOU\nHAVE HAD WITH JEH JOHNSON OF HOMELAND SECURITY SAID HE'S\nTASKING PEOPLE TO HELP WORK WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO MAKE SURE\nTHE ELECTION SYSTEM IS SAFE FROM HACKING AND FROM INTERFERENCE.\n>> THAT'S A VERY DIFFERENT QUESTION.\nOF COURSE IT APPEARS TO BE THAT THE GENERAL BELIEF IS THAT THE\nHACKS ARE INTENDED TO UNDERCUT CONFIDENCE IN THE U.S.\nELECTIONS.

THIS IS THE LATEST IN A STEADY\nDRUM BEAT OF HACKS OF AMERICAN POLITICIANS BELIEVED TO HAVE\nBEEN CARRIED OUT ON BEHALF OF VLADIMIR PUTIN.\nIF TRUE, WHAT'S HIS MOTIVE? >> THIS IS BASICALLY PUSHING OUT\nTHERE FOR THE AMERICAN PUBLIC, FOR THE WORLD AND ALSO FOR A\nRUSSIAN, VERY IMPORTANT DOMESTIC POLITICAL AUDIENCE, LOOK WHAT'S\nHAPPENING IN THE UNITED STATES. DO YOU REALLY THINK THIS PICTURE\nTHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE IS ANY BETTER THAN OTHER SYSTEMS AROUND\nTHE WORLD, AND WHAT GIVES THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE ENGAGED IN THIS\nKIND OF DIRTY POLITICS THE RIGHT TO MAKE PRONOUNCEMENTS ON OUR\nPOLITICAL SYSTEMS. >> SO IS D.C.

LEAKS DESCRIBES ITSELF\nAS BEING THE WORK OF AMERICAN ACTIVISTS.\nVLADIMIR PUTIN HAS DENIED BEING BEHIND RECENT HACKS OF THE\nDEMOCRATIC PARTY AND PUTIN'S SPOKESMAN CAME OUT AND SAID THE\nALLEGATIONS OF THE RUSSIANS INTERFERING ABOUT THE AMERICAN\nELECTION IS AN EXAMPLE OF PUTIN PHOBIA.\n>> THIS COULD BE THEM WANTING TO RETALIATE FOR WHAT THEY CHARGE\nHAS BEEN AMERICAN INTERFERENCE IN THEIR ELECTIONS.\n>> ONE ANALYST POINTS OUT THAT THE VOTE WAS CORRUPTED.\nTHE RUSSIANS BELIEVE THE AMERICANS TRIED TO SUBVERT HIS\nELECTION. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF THAT BUT\nTHIS COULD BE HIS RETALIATION FOR THAT SAYING, BACK OFF THE\nNEXT RUSSIAN ELECTIONS.

OZ.\nIT'S AN AMAZING MOMENT 55 DAYS OUT FROM THE ELECTION DAY.\n>> WELL, I WAS JUST THINKING,  ADDITION TO ALL THE OTHER HEALTH\nISSUES, THE TWO CANDIDATES HAVE HAD A PERSONALITY TRANSPLANT\nBECAUSE HERE YOU HAVE HILLARY CLINTON SENDING OUT 20 TWEETS,\nSHE AND HER CAMPAIGN, 20 TWEETS IN ONE HOUR, SOUNDS LIKE TRUMP,\nAND TRUMP IS DISCLOSING MEDICAL RECORDS ON DR. OZ BEING\nTRANSPARENT THE DAY AFTER HE ANNOUNCED A BIG NEW PROPOSAL FOR\nA BIG GOVERNMENT SPENDING PROGRAM ON PAY MATERNITY LEAVE.\n>> IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. AND YOU WONDER WHAT KIND OF\nPRESSURE THIS IS GOING TO PUT ON HILLARY CLINTON AND HER CAMP TO\nRELEASE MORE OF HER MEDICAL HISTORY BECAUSE ACCORDING TO DR.\nOZ, HE WENT THROUGH A FULL REVIEW OF TRUMP'S SYSTEMS, AND\nLAUNDRY LISTED NERVOUS SYSTEM, HEAD AND NECK, HORMONE LEVELS,\nCARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH. I MEAN OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF PEOPLE\nARE GOING TO TUNE IN INTO THAT AND SEE HOW THAT WENT.\nHIS DOCTOR SAYS HE IS HEALTHY AND FIT TO BE PRESIDENT, BUT\nHILLARY CLINTON, WE'RE STILL WAITING, THEY ARE PROMISING THAT\nWE WILL SEE MORE OF HER MEDICAL HISTORY LATER ON THIS WEEK.\n>> WELL, TO BE FAIR, SHE HAD BEEN A LOT MORE TRANSPARENT UP\nUNTIL NOW THAN DONALD TRUMP HAD AS YOU REMEMBER, HE HAD HIS\nGASTROSBROLGS SEND A TWO-PARAGRAPH NOTE WHILE THE\nLIMOUSINE WAITING OUTSIDE SAID THAT TRUMP WILL BE THE\nHEALTHIEST PRESIDENT IN HISTORY, BUT AT THIS POINT, THE HEALTH\nTRANSPARENCY GAP NOW WORKS IN TRUMP'S FAVOR BECAUSE OF THE DR.\nOZ INCIDENT. SO SHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO GO ON\nSOME REALITY TV SHOW AND RELEASE ALL OF HER -- SERIOUSLY\nSPEAKING, SHE IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE MORE FORTHCOMING\nPARTICULARLY AFTER THIS HEALTH SCARE OVER THE WEEKEND.\n>> ABOUT THE WEIGHT LOSS YOU HEARD, APPARENTLY DONALD TRUMP\nSAID TO DR. OZ HE WOULD LIKE TO LOSE 15 TO 20 POUNDS, DR. OZ\nAGREED IS WHAT DR. OZ'S SHOW HAS TOLD US.\nFORMER SECRETARY OF STATE COLON POWELL REVEALING, CHRIS, HOW HE\nREALLY FEELS ABOUT BOTH OF THESE CANDIDATES.\nHACKERS LEAKING COLON POWELL'S PRIVATE E-MAILS.\nPOUFL WAS CALLING TRUMP A NATIONAL DISGRACE AND AN\nINTERNATIONAL PARIAH. HE ALSO SLAMS CLINTON FOR TRYING\nTO MAKE HIM A SCAPEGOAT IN THE HER E-MAIL SCANNEDING SAYING I\nTOLD HER STAFF THREE TIMES. I HAD TO THROW A MINI TANTRUM TO\nGET THEIR ATTENTION. SHE KEEPS TRIPPING INTO THESE\nCHARACTER MINE FIELDS. WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THESE\nE-MAIL REVELATIONS, CHRIS? >> WELL, I HAVE TO SAY, I MAKE\nMORE OF WHAT POWELL IS SAYING ABOUT CLINTON.\nPOWELL HAS BECOME A REPUBLICAN IN NAME ONLY.\nIF YOU REMEMBER HE SUPPORTED BARACK OBAMA AGAINST McCAIN IN\n2008, OBAMA AGAINST ROMNEY IN 2012, SO NO SURPRISE THAT HE\nWOULD NOT -- THE LANGUAGE IS KIND OF TOUGH, BUT NO SURPRISE\nTHAT HE WOULDN'T HAVE MUCH USE FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nBUT YOU CAN TELL, HE IS GENUINELY UPSET BY THE CLINTON\nCAMPAIGNS. AND IT HAS BEEN AN EFFORT ON\nTHEIR PART TO SAY WELL SHE WAS JUST FOLLOWING THE ADVICE OF\nCOLON POWELL WHEN SHE SAID UP THIS PRIVATE SYSTEM.\nTHE FACT IS, THEY WERE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS.\nPOWELL DIDN'T HAVE A PRIVATE SERVER IN HIS BASEMENT, HE WAS\nUSING AOL.COM BACK IN 2005, OR 2000 RATHER, BACK WHEN THE WHOLE\nE-MAIL SYSTEM AND THE INTERNET WAS ALL COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.\nSO, YOU KNOW, I THINK WITH SOME JUSTICE, HE IS UPSET AT THE\nIDEAS. HE IS TRYING TO DRAG HIM INTO\nTHIS AND MAKE IT SEEM LIKE HE WAS THE REASON THAT HILLARY\nCLINTON SET UP THE PRIVATE SERVER.\n>> THERE WAS ALSO AN E-MAIL EXCHANGE WITH A DEMOCRATIC E\nMEGA DONOR, JEFFREY LEADS WAS IN THERE DEPICTING HER AS A SORE\nLOSER WHEN SHE LOST TO BARACK OBAMA SAYING SHE HATES THAT THE\nPRESIDENT KICKED HER BUTT IN 2008.\nSHE USED A DIFFERENT WORD THERE, BUT HE WENT ON TO SAY NO ONE\nLIKES HER AND THE CRIMINAL THING AIN'T OVER.\nI DON'T THINK THE PRESIDENT WOULD WEEP IF SHE FOUND HERSELF\nIN REAL LEGAL TROUBLE. WAS THIS ALSO VERY REVEALING OF\nTHE JITTERS THAT THE PARTY, THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN GENERAL IS\nFEELING RIGHT NOW OVER HILLARY CLINTON AND RECENT POLLING?\n>> OH SURE. LOOK, THIS RACE IS TIGHTENING,\nAND IT'S TIGHTENING I THINK FOR TWO REASONS.\nONE, DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN A MORE DISCIPLINED, BETTER\nCANDIDATE OVER THE LAST THREE, FOUR WEEKS SINCE HIS NEW TEAM\nTOOK OVER, AND AGAIN, THIS GOES TO THE PERSONALITY TRANSPLANT.\nHE IS DELIVERING MORE SPEECHES ON TELEPROMPTER, MORE POLICY IN\nHIS SPEECHES. YOU KNOW, THERE'VE BEEN SOME\nBUMPS IN THE ROAD, FOR INSTANCE GOING DOWN TO MEXICO, HAVING\nTHAT MEETING WITH THE MEXICAN PRESIDENT, THEN COMING BACK AND\nSEEMING TO GO BACK ON THE IDEA HE WAS GOING TO SOFTEN HIS\nPOSITION ON IMMIGRATION AND IN FACT DELIVERING A HARD LINE\nPOSITION, BUT MEANWHILE, THE NEWS HAS BEEN ALMOST ALL BAD FOR\nHILLARY CLINTON FOR SEVERAL WEEKS NOW.\nMORE REVELATIONS ABOUT THE E-MAIL, THE FBI 15,000 E-MAILS\nTHEY WERE ABLE TO RECOVER, THE COZY CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE\nCLINTON FOUNDATION, THE STATE DEPARTMENT, NOW THE HEALTH\nSCARE. SO NOT SURPRISINGLY ALL OF THIS\nHAS LED TO HIS RISE IN THE POLLS AND HER DECLINE.\nSTILL, VERY MUCH SHE'S STILL THE FAVORITE, BUT IF HE IS AHEAD BY\nFIVE POINTS IN OHIO, THAT'S A VERY TELLING SIGN.\nTHAT IS A, YOU KNOW, THE SWINGINGEST OF SWING STATES AND\nONE THAT THE REPUBLICANS ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO HAVE.\n>> THERE IS SO MUCH GOING ON IN THIS HORSE RACE AND YOU HAVE\nINTERESTING GUESTS ON FOX NEWS SUNDAY.\nWHO DO YOU HAVE? >> TOP OFFICIALS OF BOTH THE\nTRUMP AND CLINTON COMPANIES, BUT ALSO WE'RE GOING TO TALK TO\nGEORGE CLOONEY AND JOHN PRENDERGST.\nFASCINATING INVESTIGATION THEY'VE UNDERTAKEN.\nTHE HUMAN RIGHTS IN AFRICA, THEY HAVE SET UP SOMETHING CALLED THE\nCENTURY WHICH IS UNCOVERED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THEFT AND\nCORRUPTION IN SOUTH SUDAN. THE NEWEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD\nWITH MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN THAT COUNTRY BEING CAUGHT IN THE\nCROSS FIRE. WE'LL BE TALKING GEORGE CLOONEY\nABOUT THAT AND ALSO TALK SOME POLITICS, ALL COMING UP ON FOX\nNEWS SUNDAY. >> VERY GOOD STUFF, CHRIS\nWALLACE, THANKS FOR JOINING THUS AFTERNOON, GOOD TO HAVE YOU.\n>> YOU BET.",

THEY SAY IN TERMS OF HER\nPNEUMONIA DIAGNOSIS LAST FRIDAY, HILLARY CLINTON HAD A\nNON-CONTRAST CHEST CT SCAN THAT WAS PERFORMED LAST FRIDAY.\nTHE RESULTS REVEALED A SMALL RIGHT MIDDLE LOBE PNEUMONIA.\nTHEY ALSO SAY THIS WAS A MILD, NON-CONTAGIOUS BACTERIAL\nPNEUMONIA.

IF THE PRESIDENT ELECT WERE TO\nHAVE ANY KIND OF HEALTH ISSUE, VOTERS WANT TO LOOK AT THE VICE\nPRESIDENTIAL CHOICE AS WELL, AND THAT CHOICE IS OUT THERE AS WELL\nFOR VOTERS TO MAKE A DETERMINATION.\n>> IT'S ALSO ABOUT TRANSPARENCY, AND I GUESS THAT'S THE ISSUE A\nLOT OF REPORTERS HAD WHEN THIS HAPPENED ON SUNDAY WHICH WAS,\nWHY DON'T YOU TELL US EITHER WHEN YOU GET THE PNEUMONIA\nDIAGNOSIS IN THE FIRST PLACE OR TELL US WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS\nHAPPENS WHY THERE'S BEEN AN INCIDENT.\n>> RIGHT, LIMITED HISTORY GIVEN OUT OVER THE WEEKEND.\nIT WASN'T UNTIL HILLARY CLINTON'S WOBBLY MOMENT AT THE\n9/11 CEREMONY ON SUNDAY THAT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN FINALLY SAID,\nYES, SHE'S BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA.\nAFTER THAT THEY GAVE DIFFERENT  SINCE THE PNEUMONIA DIAGNOSIS,\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF, HAS BEEN VERY HANDS OFF\nIN TERMS OF HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT, I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO\nTHAT. I WISH HER WELL AND HOPE SHE CAN\nGET BACK ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.

THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN DID THIS\nLARGELY BECAUSE SECRETARY CLINTON, WE HAVE TO SAY, WAS\nCAUGHT ON VIDEO SUNDAY SEEMING TO COLLAPSE.\nIT HAPPENED AFTER CLINTON KEPT THE PRESS IN THE DARK ABOUT\nLEAVING A 9/11 MEMORIAL SERVICE. WE HAVE SINCE CLINTON HAD BEEN\nDIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA TWO DAYS BEFORE THE HEALTH SCARE AND\nCHOSE NOT TO DISCLOSE HER HEALTH CONDITION.\nI'M JOINED BY DR.

THERE MAY BE MORE COMING BUT\nIT'S SORT OF UNCLEAR. THOSE ARE SORT OF THE\nHIGHLIGHTS, JAKE. >> CAN THE MEDICINE YOU\nMENTIONED LEVAQUIN CAUSE DIZZINESS?\n>> NOT TYPICALLY CAUSE DIZZINESS.\nTHERE ARE SOME SIDE EFFECTS OF THIS MEDICATION.\nONE OF THE ONES IT CAN CAUSE IS IT CAN CAUSE YOU TO HAVE PAIN IN\nCERTAIN JOINTS AND TENDONS. NOT TYPICALLY DIZZINESS.\nAS JAKE, YOU AND I TALKED ABOUT THE PNEUMONIA ITSELF COULD\nPOTENTIALLY CAUSE DIZZINESS, CAUSE SOMEONE TO BE DEHYDRATED.\nONE OF THE MEDICATIONS FOR THE HYPOTHYROIDISM IS MAKE SOMEONE\nHEAT INTOLERANT MEANING THEY DON'T TOLERATE HEAT AS WELL.\nAND THE MEDICATIONS, THE ANTIHISTAMINES THAT BRIANNA WAS\nMENTIONING CAN CAUSE SOMEONE TO BE MORE DEHYDRATED AS WELL.\nTHE COMBINATION OF THINGS PERHAPS.\nTHE LEVAQUIN HAS SOME SIDE EFFECTS BUT NOT THAT ONE SO\nMUCH. >> JEFF ZELENY, WHY IS THE\nCAMPAIGN RELEASING THE DOCUMENTS NOW?\n>> IT'S BEEN KNOCKED OFF COURSE THIS WEEK WITH THE DIAGNOSIS OF\nTHIS.

SHE'S UNDER INCREDIBLE PRESSURE\nTO GET OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.\nINITIALLY WE WERE TOLD HER DOCTOR SAID FIVE DAYS OF REST.\nSHE'S BEEN RESTING FOR THREE DAYS.\nWE LEARNED YESTERDAY THEY PLANNED TO RELEASE THE RECORDS.\nTHERE ARE NO RECORDS THAT HAVE BEEN RELEASED FROM 2012 WHEN SHE\nHAD A FAULT THAT LED TO A CONCUSSION.\nTHAT IS SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN ASKING ABOUT.\nTHAT WAS NOT IN THE RELEASE TODAY.\nSUDDEN HEARD AS WELL AS I DID THAT SHE PLANS TO RESUME HER\nCAMPAIGN GOING AROUND THE COUNTRY AFTER TWO DAYS OF REST.\nTOMORROW -- ON THE PHONE WITH US, DOCTOR OF\nINTERNAL MEDICINE, DR. RAJH. I KNOW THERE'S LITTLE YOU KNOW.\nYOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD A SMATTERING OF THAT.\nI THINK WHAT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS TRYING TO DO IS SAY\nTHIS PNEUMONIA IS THE WORST OF IT, THERE'S NOTHING ELSE HERE,\nTHERE'S NOTHING SORDID OR SECRETIVE GOING ON HERE.\nWHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT YOU HEARD?\n>> Caller: I THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO GIVE US AN UPDATE\nABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW. THIS INFORMATION DOESN'T REALLY\nREFER TO ANY OF HER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY.\nIT'S NOT A COMPREHENSIVE MEDICAL RECORD BY ANY MEANS.\nIT'S AN UPDATE ON THE RECENT SITUATION AND THE FACT THAT SHE\nWAS EXAMINED AS RECENTLY AS TODAY AND IS IN GOOD HEALTH IN\nTERMS OF HER BLOOD PRESSURE AND HER OTHER NUMBERS.\nCHOLESTEROL, THINGS OF THAT NATURE, EXPLAINING ABOUT HOW\nTHEY CAME TO THE DIAGNOSIS OF  SCAN THAT DID SHOW THAT'S WHAT\nWAS GOING ON AND NOTHING ELSE. AND TALKING ABOUT HER\nMEDICATIONS WHICH ARE FAIRLY TYPICAL FOR SOMEONE HER AGE, A\nTHYROID MEDICATION, A BLOOD THINNER WHICH DOES REFERENCE THE\nPRIOR EPISODE OF BLOOD CLOTS IN THE PAST AND THE ANTIBIOTIC\nSHE'S ON. IT'S A LITTLE MORE OF AN\nEXPLANATION OF THE RECENT HISTORY.\nIT DOESN'T REALLY GET INTO WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON IN TERMS OF\nHER PRIOR MEDICAL ISSUES. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE\nPNEUMONIA THING IF WE CAN, DOCTOR.\nSHE WAS DIAGNOSED, I THINK, LAST FRIDAY, WITH THIS PNEUMONIA.\nAND SHE STILL WENT TO THE 9/11 EVENT WHICH SHE FAINTED.\nSHE'S BEEN RESTING NOW AND WILL RESUME HER CAMPAIGNING TOMORROW\nWE'RE TOLD. AS SOMEONE WHO KNOWS SOMETHING,\nOBVIOUSLY, ABOUT PNEUMONIA, IS THAT OKAY TO DO?\n>> Caller: PNEUMONIA CAN BE DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT PEOPLE.\nIT CAN BE VERY SEVERE. IT CAN BE MIND.\nI THINK IN AN IDEAL WORLD, WOULD SHE STAY HOPE AND REST LONGER?\nABSOLUTELY. OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS A CRUCIAL\nTIME FOR HER. SHE'S PROBABLY GETTING OUT AS\nQUICKLY AS SHE POSSIBLY CAN. THE LONGER SHE RESTS, THE BETTER\nFOR HER. I THINK IF SHE IS FEELING MORE\nENERGIZED AND FIT, IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A BAD THING.\nWHEN SOMEONE -- WHEN A DOCTOR RECOMMENDS FIVE DAYS OF REST,\nTHAT'S NOT SOME MAGIC NUMBER THAT'S DEFINITIVE.\nYOU MAY FEEL BETTER EARLIER IN WHICH CASE YOU COULD POTENTIALLY\nGO BACK TO WORK. >> WHAT DO YOU LOOK FOR?\nIF YOU ARE -- WHEN YOU SEE PATIENTS OR IN THIS CASE YOU ARE\nWATCHING ONE ON TV AS SHE GOES AROUND THE COUNTRY, WHAT DO YOU\nSCRUTINIZE? WHAT DO YOU SEE THAT SHE'S OKAY?\n>> Caller: YEAH, I MEAN, JUST VISUALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT\nSOMEONE, YOU LOOK AT THINGS AS SIMPLE AS THEIR SKIN COLOR.\nARE THEY PALE? IS THERE ANYTHING TO SUGGEST\nDEHYDRATION, VERY DRY SKIN? ARE THEY UNSTEADY?\nDO THEY FEEL, OF COURSE, FAINT OR DIZZY?\nIT LOOKS LIKE HER BLOOD PRESSURE AND HER TEMPERATURE WERE NORMAL\nAS OF TODAY AS WELL AS HER RESPIRATORY RATE, WHICH IS HER\nBREATHING RATE, OR OXYGENATION STATUS.\nOVERALL, YOU HAVE TO ASK THE PATIENT, HOW ARE YOU FEELING IN\nTERMS OF YOUR ENERGY LEVEL? MORE FATIGUE THAN USUAL, WEAKER?\n>> YOU THINK ABOUT IT, DOCTOR, FOR ANYONE OF ANY AGE, RUNNING\nFOR PRESIDENT IS A GRUELING UNDERTAKING.\n>> Caller: ABSOLUTELY. >> ON THE FLIP SIDE, YOU MIGHT\nHAVE HEARD DONALD TRUMP WAS ON THE DR. OZ SHOW.\nHE DID PROVIDE WHAT LOOKS LIKE SOME SHEETS OF PAPER TO DR. OZ,\nPRESUMABLY FROM HIS OWN DOCTORS, MEDICAL TEAM, OUTLINING HOW HE\nIS DOING. WE ARE TOLD VERY WELL.\nTHOSE WHO WERE IN THE AUDIENCE APPARENTLY SAID THAT TRUMP\nACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE HAD SOME WEIGHT TO LOSE.\nBUT THAT'S ABOUT THE EXTENT OF IT.\nWHAT DO YOU LOOK FOR IN HIM? WHAT DO YOU THINK OF USING THAT\nVENUE TO LET PEOPLE KNOW YOU ARE OKAY?\n>> Caller: YEAH, I THINK BOTH CANDIDATES ARE TRYING TO RELEASE\nSOME INFORMATION TO REASSURE THE PUBLIC THEY'RE BOTH FIT AND\nHEALTHY. I HONESTLY THINK WATCHING BOTH\nOF THEY, GIVEN THEIR AGE AND THE GRUELING SCHEDULE THEY\nUNDERGOING, TO ME THEY LOOK LIKE THEY HAVE A LOT OF STAMINA AND\nENERGY, MORE THAN MOST PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF THEIR AGE.\nI THINK THEY BOTH LOOK LIKE THEY'RE IN GOOD SHAPE.\nOF COURSE, WE WILL WANT TO SEE MORE DETAILS ABOUT PAST MEDICAL\nISSUES. TO ME LOOKING AT BOTH OF THEM, I\nTHINK THEY'RE BOTH FIT. >> BY THE WAY, PEOPLE HATE THE\nFACT THAT DONALD TRUMP ADMITS HE LIKES FAST FOOD.\nAS A DOCTOR, TELL ME YOU ARE NOT ONE OF THOSE DOCTORS WHO SAID,\nDON'T TRY FAST FOOD. >> Caller: EVERYTHING IN\nMODERATION IS OKAY. LL B>>IARI NTANERDOSWOR, CT\nTHAT WAS A BRILLIANT ANSWER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TAKING\nTHE TIME. I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT.\nWHAT'S THAT FEELING WHEN YOU ARE IN A GLASS HOUSE?\nDON'T THROW STONES. THAT'S ME.\nON THE PHONE WITH ME CAITLYN BURNS.\nTHIS MEDICAL ISSUE IS FRONT AND CENTER.\n>> Caller: ABSOLUTELY. WHY IT'S IMPORTANT THIS CYCLE IS\nBECAUSE BOTH HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP, IF EITHER WERE\nELECTED, WOULD BE THE OLDEST PRESIDENT AT THEIR INAUGURATION.\nRONALD REAGAN WAS 69 WHEN HE TOOK OFFICE.\nDONALD TRUMP IS 70. AND AS WE KNOW, HILLARY CLINTON\nIS 69. THE ISSUE OF HEALTH IS REALLY\nIMPORTANT. OF COURSE, IT HAS BEEN\nHIGHLIGHTED MOST RECENTLY BY THE CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING CLINTON\nAND THE PNEUMONIA DIAGNOSIS AND TIME SHE DISCLOSED IT.\nTHAT'S WHAT PUT IT FRONT AND CENTER THIS WEEK.\nAS WE KNOW, CANDIDATES TRADITIONALLY HAVE BEEN SLIGHTLY\nMORE FORTHCOMING IN TERMS OF THEIR MEDICAL HISTORY.\nCLINTON HAS BEEN MORE FORTH COMING THAN DONALD TRUMP HAS.\nWE KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S MEDICAL HISTORY.\nREMEMBER IN 2008, JOHN McCAIN KIND OF SET THAT STANDARD OF\nRELEASING 1200 PAGES OF DOCUMENTS THAT REPORTERS --\n>> A LOT OF GOOD THAT DID JOHN McCAIN.\nRIGHT? HE HAD DOCTORS POURING OVER THE\nINFORMATION. THEY COULDN'T LEAVE A ROOM.\nTHEY CONVEYED THAT TO JOURNALISTS COVERING THE\nCAMPAIGN. IT DIDN'T DO SQUAT FOR HIM.\n>> Caller: IT WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE HE HAD THE HISTORY WITH\nMELANOMA. THAT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER.\nKERRY, OF COURSE, HAD MEDICAL ISSUES AS WELL.\nRIGHT NOW, THE QUESTION THIS WEEK -- THE POLITICAL QUESTION\nIS REALLY AROUND TRANSPARENCY. AND THIS IDEA THAT THESE\nCANDIDATES SHOULD BE DISCLOSING MORE ABOUT THEMSELVES THAN THEY\nCURRENTLY ARE. >> WELL PUT.\nTHANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR A LOT OF YOU TUNING IN, A\nDAY THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE CHANGED A LITTLE BIT IN STATES\nTHAT LOOKED IMPOSSIBLE FOR DONALD TRUMP, MORE POSSIBLE.\nTHE DRAMATIC NEWS OF THE DAY IS THE FACT THAT AN ESTABLISHED\nDOCTOR HERE IN NEW YORK CITY SAID JUNK FOOD IS PERFECTLY FINE\nIN MODERATION. WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU PEOPLE?\nIN MODERATION. FOLLOW ME.\nGOOD HEALTH. THERE YOU GO.\nSEE YOU TOMORROW.      <i> Down came the rain...</i> <i>...and clogged the gutter system</i>   <i> creating a leak in the roof.</i>   <i> Luckily the spider recently</i>\n       <i> had GEICO help him</i>    <i> with homeowners insurance.</i>    <i> Water completely destroyed</i>\n   <i> his Swedish foam mattress.</i>     <i> He got full replacement</i>      <i> and now owns the Sleep</i>\n          <i> Number Bed.</i> <i>His sleep number setting is 25.</i>            <i> Call GEICO</i> <i>and see how much you could save</i>     <i> on homeowners insurance.</i>     If you have moderate to\n  severe rheumatoid arthritis,   SERIOUS ALLERGIC REACTIONS,         OR HAVE FLU-LIKE\n       SYMPTOMS OR SORES.

YOU KNOW, BROAD INDEX FUNDS\nWHICH GIVE PEOPLE BROAD MARKET EXPOSURE AT VERY LOW COST.\nAND THEN THE SECOND BIG CATEGORY ARE OUR TARGET DATE FUNDS WHICH\nARE VERY POPULAR IN THE 401(k) ARENA.\nI THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY A REALLY ENCOURAGING SIGN THAT SO MANY\nINVESTORS ARE USING THESE TARGET RETIREMENT SOLUTIONS, IF YOU\nWILL, TO SET THEMSELVES UP FOR RETIREMENT.\n>> PART OF THIS IS COMING THAT FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW ACTIVE\nINVESTORS HAVE HAD A MUCH TOUGHER TIME.\nTHEY'VE HAD A TOUGHER TIME MATCHING UP TO THE INDEXES.\nWHEN YOU SEE SWINGS LIKE THAT, YOU DO SEE PEOPLE SAY FORGET\nABOUT IT. I'M NOT GOING TO TRY TO BEAT THE\nMARKET WHEN EVEN THE PROS CAN'T BEAT THE MARKET.\nBUT WITH THIS CYCLICAL SWING, HOW MUCH OF IT DO YOU THINK\nSTICKS THIS TIME AROUND? HOW MANY OF THESE INVESTORS CAN\nYOU KEEP IF THERE IS SUDDENLY A PERIOD WHERE THE INDICES DO\nPOORLY AND ACTIVE MANAGERS ARE OUT PERFORMING?\n>> YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT'S A QUESTION THAT WE GET A FROM A\nLOT OF INVESTORS. I THINK THERE IS ALWAYS A\nCYCLICAL ELEMENT TO THIS. SO WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING COULD\nCERTAINLY HAPPEN. BUT I THINK THERE'S A MUCH MORE\nSECULAR CHANGE GOING ON HERE. YOU KNOW, EARLIER IN YOUR SHOW\nYOU HAD SALLIE KRAWCHECK ON WHO WAS TALKING ABOUT HER NEW\nVENTURE. IF I HEARD CORRECTLY, SALLIE'S\nSET UP A SERIES OF PORTFOLIOS FOR HER CLIENTS THAT ARE USING\nLOW COST ETFs, INDEX BASED FUNDS TO CREATE SOLUTIONS FOR\nINVESTORS. SO WE'RE SEEING A BIG TREND.\nIT'S COMING FROM SOME OF THE FIN TECHES, TRADITIONAL ADVISERS,\nAND THEN OF COURSE INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS THEMSELVES ARE\nCHOOSING TO DO THIS. IT'S LESS SORT OF POINT SOLUTION\nJUST FLOWING INTO A PRODUCT. IT'S ABOUT A HOLISTIC APPROACH.\nAND I THINK THAT'S THE SECULAR ELEMENT.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT COMPETITIVENESS.\nWHY MICHAEL PORTER IS HERE AND WHY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IT.\nIF YOU LOOK AT YOUR BUSINESS, YOU'VE DONE VERY WELL.\nWHAT WORRIES YOU ABOUT COMPETITIVENESS IN THE UNITED\nSTATES? >> WELL, YOU KNOW, MICHAEL'S\nSTUDY IS JUST OUT. MICHAEL, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR\nGIVING ME AT LEAST 12 HOURS TO DIGEST IT ALL.\nIT'S A TERRIFIC PIECE OF WORK. AND I THINK IT UNDERSCORES\nTOPICS THAT HAVE BEEN VERY MUCH FRONT OF MIND FOR THE LAST\nSEVERAL YEARS FOR MANY PEOPLE. AND, YOU KNOW, WHAT WORRIES US\nIS THAT THE ECONOMY BROADLY HAS NOT BEEN GROWING AT THE RATE\nTHAT WE THINK IT NEEDS TO GROW. AND ONE OF THE, YOU KNOW, HUGE\nIMPACTS OF THAT IS WE'RE NOT LIFTING THE STANDARD OF LIVING\nFOR AS MANY PEOPLE AS WE COULD. AND I THINK AT THE HEART OF IT,\nTHAT'S REALLY WHAT A LOT OF THE WORK POINTS TO.\nAND SOME OF THE PRESCRIPTIONS FOR, YOU KNOW, MOVING FORWARD IN\nTHE HARVARD WORK REALLY TRY TO GET AT THAT.\nYOU KNOW, I'D ADD TO IT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS A PERVASIVE\nISSUE THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY CALLED OUT IN THE PAPER BUT IT'S\nREALLY IMPLIED. I THINK THERE'S A TREMENDOUS\nOVER-EMPHASIS ON THE SHORT-TERM. AND THIS IS -- THIS OCCURS IN\nTHE POLITICAL ARENA. IT OCCURS IN RUNNING BUSINESSES.\nAND IT OCCURS IN THE INVESTMENT ARENA.\nAND I THINK ONE OF THE REAL CALLS TO ACTION HAS TO BE TO --\nFOR EVERYONE TO TAKE A MUCH LONGER TERM PERSPECTIVE.\n>> MICHAEL, ONE OF THE ISSUES YOU ALL POINT OUT IS THAT WE\nHAVE NOT GOTTEN BACK TO THE MEDIAN PAY LEVELS WE WERE\nLOOKING AT FOR MIDDLE INCOME HOUSES SINCE 1999.\nBUT WE DID SEE A BIG JUMP OVER THE LAST YEAR AND THOSE\nSTATISTICS THAT WERE JUST RELEASED THIS WEEK.\nIS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU THINK WE CAN MAKE A MOVE AND GET BACK\nTO SOME OF THESE LEVELS? BUT IS IT STILL NOT ENOUGH\nPROGRESS FOR YOU? >> AGAIN, IT'S VERY ENCOURAGING\nTO SEE MEDIAN INCOME GO UP AFTER 17, 18 YEARS OF DECLINE --\nCONTINUOUS DECLINE. IT BUMPED UP WHETHER THAT'S AN\nANOMALY OR A NEW TREND IS STILL UNCLEAR.\nBUT I MEAN, THE COLD HARD TRUTH IS WE'RE STILL 18 YEARS BEHIND.\nWE'RE STILL GETTING CLOSER TO WHERE WE WERE 18 YEARS AGO.\nAND WE DON'T SEE STRUCTURALLY IN THE TERMS OF UNDERPINNINGS OF\nSKILL, EDUCATION, AND THE KIND OF FUNDAMENTALS OF\nCOMPETITIVENESS. WE DON'T SEE THE UNDERPINNINGS\nRIGHT YET THAT ARE GOING TO TURN THAT INTO A KIND OF NEW ERA OF\nGROWTH AND PROSPERITY. YOU KNOW, IT'S GREAT.\nIT REMINDS ME WE'VE BEEN IN THIS GAME NOW FOR FIVE OR SIX YEARS.\nWE HAVE A JOBS REPORT AND IT LOOKS A LITTLE GOOD AND WE SAY\nGOOD WE'RE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.\nTHEN TWO JOBS REPORTS LATER, THINGS GO DOWN.\nAND THE COLD HEART TRUTH AND BILL SAID THIS IS GROWTH IS VERY\nSLOW COMPARED TO OUR TRADITION. PRODUCTIVITY IS NOT IMPROVING\nVERY RAPIDLY. INVESTMENT IS LOW IN OUR\nECONOMY. AND SO UNFORTUNATELY I THINK\nTHAT WE'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH SOME FUNDAMENTALS.\nTHERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE'VE ALLOWED TO SLIP AND THEY\nPARTICULARLY HURT THE AVERAGE CITIZEN, THE PERSON WITHOUT A\nLOT OF SKILL, THE SMALLER COMPANY.\nAND WE'RE JUST NOT MAKING PROGRESS.\n>> MICHAEL, DO YOU SEE, THOUGH, IN THE PRESIDENTIAL DIALOGUE,\nTHE PRESIDENTIAL RACES THERE'S ENOUGH DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS?\nTHERE'S ENOUGH IDENTIFICATION OF THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE THAT\nLEADS YOU TO CONCLUDE THAT SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN?\nYOU'VE BEEN AFTER THIS FOR FIVE YEARS WITH SOME -- ALWAYS WITH\nSOME INSIGHTFUL THOUGHTS ON THE SUBJECT.\nYET WE CONTINUE TO REGRESS. IS THERE ANY REASON FOR\nOPTIMISM? >> WELL, LARRY, YOU KNOW,\nTHERE'S REASON FOR OPTIMISM ABOUT AMERICA.\nWE HAVE SOME TERRIFIC COMPANIES. WE HAVE GOOD MANAGEMENT.\nWE HAVE A LOT OF STRENGTHS THAT WE TALK ABOUT IN OUR REPORT.\nAMERICA'S A DYNAMIC PLACE. BUT FRANKLY OVER THESE FIVE\nYEARS THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS, I'VE COME TO BELIEVE THAT\nACTUALLY THERE'S THE OVER-ARCHING PROBLEM RIGHT NOW\nIS ACTUALLY THE POLITICAL SYSTEM.\nIT'S WHAT THE SYSTEM IS DELIVERING.\nIT'S JUST NOT DELIVERING SOLUTIONS.\n>> YOU MEAN THE WAY WE FIND OUR CANDIDATES, THE WAY YOU HAVE TO\nRISE UP THROUGH? >> THE WAY WE FIND OUR\nCANDIDATES. THE WAY THAT THE DIALOGUE IS NOT\nABOUT SOLVING A PROBLEM. IT'S ABOUT ESSENTIALLY DIVIDING\nTHE ELECTORATE FOR ONE OR THE OTHER.\nWE DISCUSS EVERYTHING IN A VERY SIMPLISTIC WAY.\nTRADE IS GOOD, TRADE IS BAD. WELL, TRADE IS COMPLICATED.\nAND OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT WE WANT TO EXPAND TRADE.\nWE WANT ACCESS TO INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.\nBUT WE'RE NOT HAVING A PRODUCTIVE DIALOGUE AND WE'RE\nNOT GETTING ANYTHING DONE. >> WE'RE ALMOST OUT OF TIME.\nBUT BEFORE WE LET YOU GO, WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON THE MARKETS RIGHT\nNOW? I KNOW YOU'VE MADE SOME COMMENTS\nIN THE PAST ABOUT HOW SOME STOCK PRICES HAVE YOU A LITTLE\nCONCERNED. WHAT DO YOU THINK RIGHT NOW WHEN\nYOU SEE WHERE WE'VE COME? >> SO, YOU KNOW, WE TEND TO LOOK\nAT THINGS OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME.\nSO AS I SORT OF LOOK OUT OVER THE NEXT DECADE, WHEN WE LOOK AT\nVALUATION AND WE LOOK AT EARNINGS AND SO FORTH, OUR\nMODELS POINT TOWARD A MUCH LOWER ABSOLUTE RETURN OVER THE NEXT\nDECADE THAN WE'VE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO OVER THE PAST,\nSAY, 30 YEARS. AND WE'RE LOOKING AT THE EQUITY\nMARKET BEING IN THE SORT OF 6% TO 7% RANGE PER YEAR OVER THE\nNEXT DECADE. AND I WOULD TELL YOU THAT'S IF\nTHINGS GO REASONABLY WELL. AND SOME OF WHAT MICHAEL IS\nDESCRIBING GETS ADDRESSED. THAT'S BASED ON WHERE WE ARE\nFROM A VALUATION STANDPOINT. IN THE SHORT RUN, I HAVE NO MORE\nIDEA THAN ANYBODY ELSE BUT OVER THE NEXT DECADE THAT'S KIND OF\nTHE WAY WE'RE THINKING ABOUT IT. >> BILL, REAL QUICK ON THE\nACTIVE PASSIVE DEBATE, WHAT PERCENTAGE OF YOUR BUSINESS NOW\nIS ACTIVE? BECAUSE I ALWAYS THINK OF\nVANGUARD AS AN INDEX COMPANY BUT I KNOW A LOT OF YOUR BUSINESS\nSTILL IS ACTIVE. >> SO WE'RE ABOUT 65% INDEX AND\n35% ACTIVE. AND THAT ACTIVE IS BOTH ON THE\nFIXED INCOME SIDE AND ON THE EQUITIES SIDE.\n>> AND DO YOU SEE THAT CHANGING? INCREASING?\n>> I THINK OVER TIME. YOU KNOW, THE INDEX SIDE MAY\nCONTINUE TO CREEP UP A LITTLE BIT.\nBUT WE'VE NEVER SAID THERE'S NO PLACE FOR ACTIVE.\nWHERE I REALLY THINK THERE'S NO PLACE IS FOR HIGH PRICED ACTIVE.\nI THINK THAT'S A GAIN THAT WILL DISAPPEAR OVER TIME.\n>> BILL, I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US TODAY.\nIT'S BEEN A PLEASURE. >> GREAT TO SEE YOU ALL, THANK\nYOU. >> AND OF COURSE LARRY BOSSIDY\nAND MICHAEL PORTER ARE STAYING WITH US.\n>> SO WE'D BE 36 TO 40,000 IN 10 TO 12 YEARS.\nEVEN AT 6%. >> FOR THE DOW?\n>> YEAH. ONLY PROBLEM IS WE DON'T WANT TO\nDOUBLE FROM 10,000. THAT'S THE PROBLEM.\n>> RIGHT. >> AS LONG AS WE STAY AT 18,000.\n6%, 7% A YEAR -- NOBODY THINKS 36,000 TO 40,000 IS -- THAT'S A\nBIG NUMBER. SO THAT, YOU KNOW -- WE GOT TO\nDO A LOT RIGHT. >> THAT'S WHAT ROB BARON SAYS\nEVERY TIME HE COMES ON. IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS\nYOU'RE LOOKING AT INCREDIBLE GROWTH EVEN IF IT'S NOT THE TYPE\nOF GROWTH PERCENTAGES WE'RE USED TO.\n>>> COMING UP, WE'RE GOING TO TALK AMERICAN COMPETITIVENESS.\nSTAY TUNED.

THE MOST INTERESTING IN MY MIND\nHAS BEEN BOSTON FED PRESIDENT WHO'S A DOVE AND JOHN WILLIAMS\nFROM SAN FRANCISCO WHO'S MORE OF A CENTRIST.\nBOTH PRETTY MUCH GAVE THE SAME SPEECH LAST WEEK WHERE THEY LAID\nOUT THEIR BELIEF ON HOW THINGS WORK IN THE ECONOMY AND WHY THE\nFED DOES WHAT THEY DO. IT WAS PRETTY MUCH IDENTICAL\nSPEECHES. AND WHAT THAT TOLD ME IS THEY'RE\nBEGINNING TO COME AROUND TO KIND OF A NEW WAY OF THINKING ABOUT\nTHE WORLD WHICH IS ACTUALLY VERY SIMILAR TO THE OLD WAY OF\nTHINKING ABOUT THE WORLD AND SO MAYBE WE'RE MOVING BACK INTO A\nPERIOD WHERE WE'LL BE ABLE TO PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY.\n>> SO THE BOND MARKET PREDICTS THEY ACTUALLY RAISE RATES NEXT\nWEEK? IS THAT ABOUT RIGHT?\n>> THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT. AT SOME POINT THEY MIGHT\nSURPRISE US. I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO\nHAPPEN NEXT WEEK BUT I WOULDN'T TAKE IT TO ZERO.\nWE THINK THEY'RE GOING GO AND NEXT YEAR, WE'LL GET A TWO.\nNOT ENOUGH TO DISRUPT THE APPLE CART.\nSOME RATE HIKES WOULD BE HEALTHY, WE THINK.\n>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE UPTICK.

I THINK OTHER CENTRAL BANKS HAVE\nDONE IT BUT THEY WANT TO STEEPEN THEIR YIELD CURVE AND THE WAY\nMOST TRADERS THINK NOW IS IF ONE CENTRAL BANK IS SINKING IT IT'S\nGOING TO PERMEATE THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL BANKING COMMUNITY.\nTHESE PEOPLE ALL GET TOGETHER AND TALK OR IF THEY DON'T GET\nTOGETHER, THEY TALK.

BUT YOU CAN LOOK AT THE\nENVIRONMENT AND I THINK IT'S VERY DANGEROUS.\nIN OTHER WORDS YOU'RE WALKING ON A LEDGE AND YOU MIGHT MAKE IT TO\nTHE END, BUT HEY, YOU FALL OFF THAT LEDGE AND YOU'LL REALLY SEE\nTROUBLE. I THINK THAT COULD WELL BE.\nWHAT THEY HAVE DONE IS CREATED A TREMENDOUS INCREASE IN HIDDEN\nRISK, RISK THAT INVESTORS DON'T EXACTLY KNOW OR HAVE FACED ABOUT\nTHEIR HOLDINGS. AND I THINK IT'S A VERY\nDANGEROUS TIME IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND GLOBAL FINANCIAL\nMARKETS. >> EXPECT RETURNS ARE LOWER.\nDON'T START LEVERING UP YOUR PORTFOLIO AND TAKING THE SAME\nRISKS YOU USED TO. YOU JUST CAN'T IN THIS\nENVIRONMENT. IN THE FUTURE THERE WILL BE MORE\nOPPORTUNITIES, BUT TODAY IS NOT THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE THE SAME\nRISK YOU'VE HISTORICALLY TAKEN. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT THOSE RISKS,\nMAYBE SOME OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL.\nWE HAVE STEVE GRASSO HERE FROM STEWART FRANKEL AND OUR OWN RICK FRATELLI OUT OF SAN FRANCISCO.\nMAYBE 3% PULLBACK IN THE S&P LIKE WE'VE HAD MAY NOT\nNECESSARILY SEEM LIKE A GREAT BUYING OPPORTUNITY, BUT IS IT\nONE, POTENTIALLY, AND MAYBE IF YOU COULD LOCK IN ONE OF THOSE\nDIVIDEND DEALS NOW THAT THE SECTOR HAS SOLD OFF.\n>> THAT'S NOT ONE OF OUR FAVORITE PLACES AFTER GOING FOR\nTHE DIVIDEND YIELD. I COULD OPINE ON THAT FOREVER,\nBUT I'M NOT GOING TO. I THINK YOU CAN'T LOOK AT THE\nMARKET PER SE BEFORE YOU'RE GOING TO BUY A STOCK.\nI THINK IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR PORTFOLIO STOCK BY STOCK AND\nSAY, DO I WANT TO OWN THIS COMPANY FOR THREE TO FIVE YEARS,\nDO I THINK THIS COMPANY IS GOING TO BE BETTER IN THREE TO FIVE\nYEARS, AND IS THIS A PRICE I CAN LIVE WITH?\nTHAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD DO ON THESE DOWN DAYS, NOT NECESSARILY\nLOOK AT THE MARKET AND SAY, YEAH, LET'S BUY EVERYTHING.\n>> YOU KNOW, KIM, ONE OF THE HIDDEN RISKS, I WONDER, DOES IT\nACTUALLY LIE IN THE DIVIDEND SECTOR IN THESE PLACES THAT ARE\nSO-CALLED SAFE WHERE SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR\nYIELDS? >> ABSOLUTELY.\nI CAN'T ITERATE THIS ENOUGH, THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING\nFOR YIELD AND WANT TO LIVE OFF THE INCOME OF THEIR STOCKS WHICH\nIS, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE WAYS THAT YOU CAN INVEST, I DON'T\nTHINK THAT'S A GREAT WAY TO INVEST, ESPECIALLY AT THIS\nPOINT. THOSE STOCKS HAVE BEEN\nOVERBOUGHT. YOU KNOW, A LOT OF YOUR GUESTS\nTALK ABOUT THIS. BUT IT'S TRUE.\nTHE FUNDAMENTALS ARE NOT THERE FOR THE STOCKS THAT HAVE RISEN\nTHE MOST LIKE THE CONSUMER STAPLES.\nARE WE BUYING LESS CEREAL TODAY THAN LAST YEAR?\nI THINK YEAH. AND YET THOSE STOCKS HAVE TRADED\nUP TERRIBLY. AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THE\nINVESTORS WHO HAVE BOUGHT THOSE STOCKS FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT\nTHEY'VE GOTTEN THEMSELVES INTO. SO IT'S A DANGER.\n>> STEVE, TALK ABOUT HOW THIS TAPE IS NOW SET UP RIGHT HERE,\nAT LEAST IN YOUR VIEW. THE MARKET HAS PULLED BACK, LIKE\nI SAID, 3%. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID, WELL, WE\nKIND OF HELD LEVELS, WE KIND OF NEEDED TO HOPE THE S&P 500.\nHOW ARE YOU DOING IT? >> THE 24th, WE'LL CALL IT, THAT\nWAS YOUR OLD HIGH AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE CURRENTLY TRADING A LITTLE\nBELOW THAT. 2120 IS NOT ONLY THE MOVING DAY,\n2120 IS THE LOWEST IN THE LAST COUPLE DAYS.\nI WOULD THINK IT'S PROBABLY TRUE.\nBUYING NEW UTILITIES AS THESE EVALUATION INVESTORS, BUT I\nDON'T SEE ANYTHING CHANGING IN THE NEAR TERM, ESPECIALLY NEXT\nWEEK WHEN WE GET SOME CLARITY. WHAT I DO FIND, REALLY QUICK, IS\nTHAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT OIL. WE HAVEN'T TRADED OFF OF OIL IN\nTHE LAST TWO DAYS. WE'RE TRADING OFF OIL BECAUSE WE\nDON'T SEE THE. SO THAT'S NEGATIVE FOR THE\nOVERALL ECONOMY. >> THAT GETS TO THE HEART OF IT.\nJAPAN IS MORE IMPORTANT TO THE ANSWER THAN A YEAR AGO, AND\nBERNANKE SAID, HEY, LET'S NOT RULE OUT NEGATIVE RATES.\nWHICH WAY IS THIS THING GOING? >> THANK YOU FOR THAT, THAT'S\nJUST A WONDERFUL THING TO SAY. I TELL YOU WHAT.\nWHATEVER THE POLICYMAKERS ARE TRYING TO DO IN MANAGING RATES,\nEVENTUALLY THE OPPOSITE IS GOING TO BE MORE AGGRESSIVE BY THE\nSATISFY NATURE THAT THEY CAN'T TROLLEY THE BEAST FOREVER.\nWHEN I LISTENED TO ALL THOSE PEOPLE AT THE AFRICAN CONCERT YESTERDAY.\nTHEY WEREN'T REALLY TALKING ABOUT THE NECESSARY, THOUGH.\nTHEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THE. MENT THAT'S THE ONLY PART OF THE\nPARADE THAT WASN'T IN THE RAIN. NOW IT'S STARTING TO DRIZZLE\nTHERE SOCHLT. THEY WERE CREATED FOR ALL THE\nJOBS THAT WEREN'T CREATED THAT WERE GOOD JOBS.\nTHEY'RE NOT REALLY WORRIED ABOUT THE ECONOMIC FUTURE.\nTHAT WAS THE BRIGHT SPOT. WHEN WE LOOK AT ALL THIS, I\nTHINK IT'S MUCH MORE SIMPLE. WE HAD A BAD FUSE BOX IN OUR\nHOUSE, AND WHAT DID CENTRAL BANKS DO, WHAT DID OUR FED DO?\nTHEY STARTED TWO NEIGHBORHOODS AWAY KNOCKING DOWN WALLS UNTIL\nTHEY GOT TO THE RIGHT FUSE BOX. THAT ISN'T THE WAY IT IS.\nTHERE IS A LOT OF DAMAGE THAT'S BEEN DONE.\nAND SEARS IS STARTING TO SEE IT AT THE TOP OF THE PYRAMID.\nSALES HAVE BEEN IN THERE. PEOPLE LOOKING FOR MUCH MORE\nUPWARD MOBILITY, THEY'VE BEEN THERE.\nPEOPLE WHO PAY A LOT OF HEALTH CARE COSTS, THEY'VE BEEN THERE.\nWELCOME TO THE CLUB. >> RICK, QUICKLY, THOUGH, IF\nHARKTS. >> WHERE DO YIELDS GO?\nWHERE DOES THE MARKET THINK THEY CAN GO AT THIS POINT?\n>> WHERE THEY GO AND WHERE THEY STAY IS A LESSON WE SHOULD HAVE\nLEARNED IN OIL. I THINK THERE IS NOWHERE FOR\nTHEM TO GO EXCEPT FOR THE OPPOSITE WAY OF THE CONTROLLERS,\nWHICH MEANS THE UP SIDE. BUT ULTIMATELY THEY'RE NOT GOING\nTO STAY THERE. IN THE END, WHEN WE'VE REACHED\nTHIS, WE STILL NEED A GLOBAL ECONOMY.\n>> I GUESS A LOT OF QUESTIONS FROM OUR CLIENTS, AND THEY'LL\nSAY, I WANT TO MANAGE THIS  THAT'S TELLING YOU.\nSO THAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT SOUNDS LIKE A REALLY GREAT DEAL\nAND WHAT YOU CAN GET AS AN. >> 7 TO 7.5 SPAERS WHAT PENSION\nFUNDS IN EVERY CITY OR MORE ALTHOUGHTY, THAT'S THEIR BOGEY.\n>> IT'S A CRAZY WORLD. CRAZY.\n>> $23 BILLION IF RATES DON'T GO UP, SORT OF DARNED IF THEY DO\nAND DARNED IF THEY DON'T, BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT THOSE FROGS WERE\nPRETTY. THEY'RE PRETTY POISONOUS.\nPOISONED DART FROGS.

SAFETY DOESN'T COME IN A BOX. >>> ONE STATE YOU CAN'T TAKE\nYOUR EYE OFF VERY LONG THIS YEAR AS IN ELECTION YEARS\nPAST IS FLORIDA BOTH CANDIDATES BRAND NEW RNC\nPOLL SHOWS TRUMP UP 47-44 IN FOUR WAY RACE.\nTHE GAP IS FOUR POINTS IN THREE WAY RACE.\nIT HAS DONALD TRUMP AHEAD BY SEVEN TENTHS OF A POINT.\nLET'S CHECK IN WITH ADAM SMITH OF THE TAMPA BAY\nTIMES.

I THINK SHE HAS HAD NOT A\nGREAT MONTH. I THINK, BASICALLY, THIS IS\nSUCH A POLARIZED ELECTORATE. THESE ARE SUCH UNPOPULAR\nCANDIDATES. I HAVE BEEN SPENDING A LOT\nOF TIME THIS WEEK TALKING TO VOTERS IN A SWING DISTRICT.\nAND THESE VOTERS CAN'T STAND EITHER OF THEM.\n>> WHICH DISTRICT IS THAT? >> THIS IS -- IT'S A\nLEGISLATIVE DISTRICT. THE RULE OF THUMB IN FLORIDA\nIS AS GOES TAMPA BAY GOES FLORIDA.\nAND JUST ABOVE TAMPA AND ST. PETERSBURG IS PSSCO.\nTHE COUNTY TO WATCH ELECTION NIGHT.\nIT'S QUITE A BELLWETHER DISTRICT.\nOBAMA WON IT TWICE. THERE HAS BEEN SOME POLLING\nOUT IN THE LAST MONTH OR SO THAT SHOWS TRUMP UP DOUBLE\nDIGITS. >> WOW.\nYOU GOT ANY IDEA WHAT ARE THE PEOPLE -- HAVE YOU BEEN\nTALKING TO PEOPLE? WHAT ARE THEY SAYING?\n>> I WILL TELL YOU WHAT I'M HEARING IS A LOT OF PEOPLE\nCANNOT STAND EITHER OF THESE CANDIDATES BUT ONE CANDIDATE\nREPRESENTS CHANGE AND THE OTHER REPRESENTS STATUS QUO.\nAND CHANGE TRUMPS EVERYTHING ELSE IN THIS CYCLE FOR THOSE\nVOTERS. >> ALL RIGHT.\nSO, NOW, WHAT ABOUT THE CANDIDATES?\nTHEY ARE THERE A LOT, RIGHT? >> YEAH.\nEVERY WEEK WE HAVE GOT THEM ONCE OR TWICE.\nUSUALLY OR PENCE OR KAINE. MIAMI IS GOING TO BE A REAL\nSTRETCH FOR HIM. THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A BIG\nHISPANIC AREA. THAT'S WHERE OBAMA REALLY\nRAN UP THE SCORE FOUR YEARS AGO.\nAND WHERE TRUMP HAS A LOT OF WORK TO DO.\nIS HE TOXIC IN A LOT OF PARTS OF MIAMI DADE WHERE\nREPUBLICANS DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIM.\n>> I HAVE SEEN POLLING LATELY THAT SUGGESTS THAT\nHILLARY CLINTON IS DOING WAY, WAY, WAY BETTER THAN\nDONALD TRUMP WITH MINORITY GROUPS BUT NOT TO THE SAME\nEXTENT THAT OBAMA DID. IS THAT CONSISTENT WITH WHAT\nYOU ARE SEEING IN FLORIDA? >> YEAH.\nTHAT'S RIGHT. WITH HISPANICS, THE VIEW\nGOING IN TO THIS THAT YOU",

AND OFTENTIMES.\nIT IS 1 OR 2 PERCENT AND IF HE GRABS ANTI- HILLARY VOTERS ON\nTHE LEFT.

THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN TRUE.\nTHIS MORNING WE HEARD FROM BOTH CANDIDATES, AND THERE ARE LOTS\nOF HEADLINES ABOUT THEM. THE ORGANIZATION SHARING THEIR\nNAME. ESPECIALLY LET'S TALK ABOUT THE\nIMPACT WITH DAVID GREGORY CNN'S POLITICAL ANALYST.\nWE HAVE SOME SOUND FROM HILLARY CLINTON'S INTERVIEW WITH DON\nLEMON AND THE CAST OF THE TOM JOYNER RADIO SHOW.\nLET'S PLAY WHAT SEEMED TO BE HER PUNCTUATION MARK.\n>> I AM SO CONCERNED ABOUT ALL OF THIS, AND YOU KNOW, I HAVE\nSAID DONALD TRUMP HAS RUN A DEPLORABLE CAMPAIGN.\nHE HAS ACCEPTED SUPPORT AND BEEN CHEERED ON BY THE LIKES OF DAVID\nDUKE, THE FORMER GRAND WIZARD OF THE KU KLUX KLAN AND OTHER WHITE\nSUPREMACISTS. IN FACT IT WAS AMAZING THE OTHER\nDAY, HIS RUNNING MATE, MIKE PENCE, WOULDN'T EVEN CALL FORMER\nKKK LEADER DAVID DUKE DEPLORABLE.\nAND I DO THINK WE HAVE TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST THIS HATRED.\nYOU KNOW, TRUMP ATTACKED A FEDERAL JUDGE FOR HIS MEXICAN\nHERITAGE. HE BULLIED A GOLD STAR FAMILY\nBECAUSE OF THEIR MUSLIM FAITH. HE PROMOTED THE LIE, AND HE\nSTILL IS REMOTING THE LIE, THAT OUR FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT IS NOT\nA TRUE AMERICAN. >> HMM.\n>> HE CALLS WOMEN PIGS AND BIMBOS.\nSO, I'M GOING TO KEEP CALLING OUT THE BIGOTR AND HATEFUL\nRHETORIC THAT HE'S BROUGHT TO THIS CAMPAIGN BECAUSE I DON'T\nTHINK YOU CAN MAKE OUR COUNTRY GREAT BY TEARING OUR PEOPLE\nDOWN. >> NOW, DAVID, YOU CAN DEBATE\nHOW MUCH HAS BEEN DONE ON COVERAGE OF TRUMP.\nTHAT'S FOR PEOPLE TO DECIDE. HOWEVER, THE POLLS ARE WHERE\nTHEY ARE. DOES THAT TELL YOU THAT PEOPLE\nWHO KNOW STILL DON'T CARE? >> WELL, I THINK THERE'S AN\nELEMENT OF THAT. I MEAN I DON'T KNOW THAT WE CAN\nBACK THAT UP BY THE DATA. BUT I DO THINK JUST -- LOOK\nANYBODY LOOKS AT A POLITICIAN AND SAYS LOOK I DON'T AGREE WITH\nEVERYTHING BUT I STILL SUPPORT THEM.\nI THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WILLFULLY IGNORE CERTAIN THINGS\nTHAT TRUMP SAYS AND FOCUS ON WHAT THEY LIKE ABOUT HIM.\nI THINK THAT'S TRUE. I THINK HILLARY CLINTON IS IN A\nPOSTURE AND YOU SAW IT IN THAT ANSWER WHICH I THOUGHT WAS\nREVEALING. FIRST OF ALL SHE WANTS TO\nSIDESTEP THE FACT THAT SHE DID IMPUGN A LOT OF TRUMP VOTERS IN\nA WAY THAT WAS INARTFUL. IT MAY HAVE BEEN ACCURATE IN\nCERTAIN -- BASED ON SOME OF THE SURVEYS THAT WE'VE SEEN ABOUT\nATTITUDES OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS AND OTHER ANECDOTAL INFORMATION\nTHAT WE HAVE. BUT YOU KNOW, HER WHOLE SLOGAN\nRHETORICALLY IS THAT WE'RE STRONGER TOGETHER.\nAND THAT WAS NOT AN EXAMPLE OF THAT WHEN SHE WAS IN THAT\nFUND-RAISER. THERE SHE'S SAYING NO I'M GOING\nTO SPEAK OUT AGAINST HATEFUL SPEECH ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE'S\nA BIRTHER, THAT DAVID DUKE IS BEHIND HIM.\nI MEAN I THINK THIS IS HER GETTING A LITTLE BIT MORE\nAGGRESSIVE. I THINK THIS IS A PREVIEW OF THE\nKIND OF HILLARY CLINTON THAT WE'LL SEE DURING ASPECTS OF\nTHESE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES. AND ANOTHER THING CHRIS AND\nALISYN, SHE ALSO WANTS TO SHOW A LITTLE BIT MORE FIGHT, AS SHE\nWANTS TO GIVE THAT CORE GROUP OF SUPPORTERS, MILLENNIAL VOTERS,\nAFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS, AND WOMEN AND OTHERS TO GET BEHIND\nHER AND GET MORE ENTHUSIASTIC SO THAT EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THIS\nIS A TIGHT RACE. WHETHER IT SHOULD BE OR NOT.\nFROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW, IT HAS BECOME A TIGHT RACE.\n>> DAVID, WE JUST HAD SECRETARY SHALALA ON WHO IS NOW THE HEAD\nOF THE CLINTON FOUNDATION. AND SHE SAID NO PROBLEM I MEAN\nSHE BASICALLY ANNOUNCED THE CHANGES THAT WILL BE HAPPENING\nPRESIDENT CLINTON WILL BE STEPPING DOWN IF HILLARY CLINTON\nIS ELECTED BUT CHELSEA CLINTON WILL CONTINUE TO BE INVOLVED.\nANY PROBLEM OR ISSUE WITH THAT FOR VOTERS?\n>> WELL I MEAN PEOPLE MAY HAVE AN ISSUE.\nWE'LL HAVE TO SEE. I MEAN AGAIN I THINK THE\nFOUNDATION BUSINESS, AND ANY CONFLICTS OF INTEREST GOES TO\nTHE HEART OF WHAT PEOPLE DON'T TRUST ABOUT THE CLINTONS,\nPLURAL, NOT JUST HILLARY CLINTON.\nKIND OF SELF-DEALING, INSIDER BUSINESS.\nIT'S ALWAYS BEEN A QUESTION WHAT ROLE WILL BILL CLINTON PLAY IN A\nCLINTON WHITE HOUSE. IT'S UNUSUAL.\nIT'S UNPRECEDENTED. THE FOUNDATION SPEAKS TO THAT.\nA LOT OF PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT THIS IF THEY HAVE A CONCERN AND\nWILL SEE SATISFACTORY ANSWERS IN TERMS OF NO MORE OF THE CLINTON\nGLOBAL INITIATIVE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS IF SHE IS THE PRESIDENT.\nTHEY PROBABLY, PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS WOULD HAVE\nLIKED TO HAVE SEEN THE CHANGES PUT INTO EFFECT EARLIER, AND\nTHAT LINE VERY CLEARLY DRAWN, BUT LOOK, I THINK THIS JUST\nBECOMES AN ISH YOU'VE OF PEOPLE WHO AREN'T GOING TO BELIEVE IT\nARE GOING TO KEEP QUESTIONS A LOT.\n>> HOW BIG A DEAL SHOULD TRUMP'S DEALINGS WITH FOREIGN ACTORS BE\nIN THIS ELECTION? THEY'RE USING IT, THE CLINTON\nPEOPLE, TO SET IT UP AS A POINT OF COMPARISON WITH THE\nFOUNDATION. HOW DO YOU THINK IT PLAYS?\n>> I THINK WE SHOULD KNOW MORE. WE SHOULD KNOW MORE ON BOTH\nSIDES ABOUT WHAT THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WERE, FINANCIAL\nAND OTHERWISE TO GAUGE POTENTIAL INFLUENCE.\nTHOSE ARE FAIR QUESTIONS FOR CLINTON, FOR THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION AS WELL, AND CERTAINLY THAT WOULD APPLY TO\nTRUMP. >> NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO\nTOMORROW THE BIG POINT OF DEFENSE FROM THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN\nIS IT'S IN THE FCC FILINGS, IT'S IN THERE.\nIT'S ALL IN THERE. IT IS NOT ALL IN THERE.\nWE WILL TELL YOU WHY IT'S NOT ALL IN THERE AND WHAT ELSE NEEDS\nTO BE NONE. WE'LL HAVE IT TOMORROW.\n>> DAVID GREGORY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nTHE GOOD STUFF IS NEXT.",

SHE'S SAYING EVERY TIME I TALKED\nTO, ASKED HER ABOUT THE MEDICAL RECORDS WHEN SHE'S GOING TO\nRELEASE THEM, WHAT HER COMMENTS WERE ABOUT WHAT COLIN POWELL\nSAID ABOUT HER SHE TURNED IT AROUND TO SHE'S CONCERNED ABOUT\nHACKING, BUT SHE'S ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT TRANSPARENCY.\nSHE SAID SHE'S BEEN MORE TRANSPARENT THAN DONALD TRUMP.\nHERE'S HILLARY CLINTON. >> I HAVE TO ASK YOU ABOUT\nSOMETHING THAT'S NEW IN THE NEWS.\nTHE FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE COLIN POWELL IN HIS HACKED\nE-MAILS HAS CRITICIZED YOU AND YOUR QUOTE, THIS IS HIS SAYING,\nMINIONS, FOR TRYING TO DRAG HIM INTO YOUR E-MAIL SERVER PROBLEM.\nHE CONCLUDES BY SAYING QUOTE EVERYTHING HRC TOUCHES, SHE KIND\nOF SCREWS UP WITH HUBRIS AND THAT'S THE END OF THE QUOTE.\nHOW DO YOU ANSWER HIM, AND CRITICS, WHO SAY WHETHER IT'S\nYOUR E-MAILS OR DISCLOSING YOUR HEALTH ISSUES OR EVEN POINTING\nOUT TRUMP'S FLYPAPER-LIKE ABILITY TO ATTRACT RACIALLY\nINSENSITIVE OR DEPLORABLES AS YOU CALL THEM, SOMEHOW THE\nMESSAGE GETS SCREWED UP? >> YOU KNOW I HAVE A GREAT DEAL\nOF RESPECT FOR COLIN POWELL. AND I HAVE A LOT OF SYMPATHY FOR\nANYONE WHOSE E-MAILS BECOME PUBLIC.\nI'M NOT GOING TO START DISCUSSING SOMEONE ELSE'S\nPRIVATE E-MAILS. I'VE ALREADY SPENT A LOT OF TIME\nTALKING ABOUT MY OWN, AS YOU KNOW.\nWHAT I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT ABOUT NIECE E-MAILS, IS THE\nCHILLING FACT THAT THE RUSSIANS ARE CONTINUING TO ATTEMPT TO\nINTERFERE IN OUR ELECTION. AND, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO SAY,\nI'M INCREASINGLY CONCERNED BY HOW WE'VE SEEN DONALD TRUMP'S\nALARMING CLOSENESS WITH THE KREMLIN BECOME MORE AND MORE\nCLEAR OVER THE COURSE OF THIS CAMPAIGN.\nIT'S DEEPLY CONCERNING, AND THERE'S A LOT THAT TRUMP SHOULD\nANSWER FOR. BECAUSE THESE ATTEMPTS BY RUSSIA\nTO INTERFERE IN THE ELECTION, ARE ONES THAT GO RIGHT HAND IN\nHAND WITH HIS CLOSENESS TO THE KREMLIN, HIS FLATTERY OF PUTIN,\nAND IT'S NOT JUST ME THAT IS NOTICING THIS, IT'S FELLOW\nREPUBLICANS OF FOREIGN POLICY AND NATIONAL SECURITY\nEXPERIENCE, NATO LEADERS, SO I'M GOING TO KEEP, YOU KNOW, RAISING\nTHE ALARGE ABOUT RUSSIAN INFLUENCE AND THAT, OF COURSE,\nRAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT WHO TRUMP ACTUALLY DOES BUSINESS WITH.\n>> CAN I -- CAN I JUST FOLLOW AND SAY THAT BY HUBRIS HE'S\nSAYING THAT YOU'RE -- YOU'RE STEPPING ON YOUR MESSAGE.\nHE'S INSINUATING THAT YOU STEP ON YOUR MESSAGE THROUGH HUBRIS\nOR ARROGANCE OR NOT BEING TRANSPARENT.\nHOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT SPECIFICALLY?\n>> AGAIN, I'M NOT -- YOU KNOW, I'M NOT GOING TO COMMENT ON\nANYTHING THAT IS SAID IN A PRIVATE E-MAIL.\n>> AND EVEN TO CRITICS BEYOND THE FORMER SECRETARY?\n>> WELL BUT I THINK I'VE WORKED VERY, VERY HARD TO BE MORE\nTRANSPARENT THAN NOT JUST MY OPPONENT, BUT REALLY IN A\nCOMPARISON TO ANYBODY WHO'S RUN, YOU KNOW, THE MEDICAL\nINFORMATION I'VE PUT OUT. AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT OUT MORE.\nMEETS AND EXCEEDS THE STANDARDS THAT OTHER PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATES, INCLUDING PRESIDENT OBAMA AND YOU KNOW MITT ROMNEY\nAND OTHERS HAVE MET. MY TAX RETURNS ARE OUT THERE, 40\nYEARS OF TRANSPARENCY ABOUT MY TAX RETURNS.\nSO I THINK THAT THE REAL QUESTIONS NEED TO BE DIRECTD\nTOWARD DONALD TRUMP, AND HIS FAILURE TO EVEN MEET THE MOST\nMINIMALISTIC STANDARDS THAT WE EXPECT OF SOMEONE BEING THE\nNOMINEE OF ONE OF OUR TWO MAJOR PARTIES.\n>> DO YOU KNOW WHEN YOUR MEDICAL RECORDS ARE GOING TO -- THE REST\nTHAT YOU SAID YOU'LL RELEASE BECAUSE HE SAYS HE'S RELEASING\nSOME SOON. DO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO\nRELEASE THE REST OF YOURS OR MORE INFORMATION?\n>> MORE INFORMATION I THINK WILL BE VERY SHORTLY.\nBECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE REALLY WANT TO RESPOND TO LEGITIMATE\nQUESTIONS THAT PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE.\nI'M VERY TOUCHED BY THE CONCERN THAT'S BEEN SET FORTH ABOUT MY\nHEALTH. I'M REALLY GLAD THAT I DID\nFINALLY FOLLOW MY DOCTOR'S ORDERS AND TAKE SOME DAYS TO\nREST. POWERING THROUGH.RYING TO KEEP -\nWHICH I THINK IS COMMON EXPERIENCE FOR PEOPLE.\nSO WE'RE GOING TO PUT OUT MORE INFORMATION, AND THAT WILL BE\nTHEN, TWICE AS MUCH AS HE PUT OUT.\nAND WE'LL SEE WHAT, IF ANYTHING, HE'S WILLING TO DISCLOSE.\n>> SECRETARY HILLARY CLINTON, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A BREAK, AND\nTHEN WE'LL COME BACK. >> DISCLOSURE TRANSPARENCY.\nBIG WORDS COMING UP HERE. LET'S BRING IN DON LEMON ALSO\nJOINING US CNN'S CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT DR. SANJAY GUPTA.\nWE'LL TALK HEALTH. WE'LL TALK THE POLITICS HERE.\nSHE WAS VERY DIRECTED IN HER ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS DON,\nWHAT DID YOU PICK UP? >> FIRST BEFORE WE GET THERE\nBECAUSE I HAVE SANJAY HERE. WHEN SHE STARTED TALKING THE\nFIRST THING I NOTICED WAS THAT SHE DIDN'T SOUND THE WAY SHE\nSOUNDED THIS WEEKEND IN THE INTERVIEW WITH ANDERSON, RIGHT?\nSHE SOUNDED LIKE, HI DON! THIS IS THE ANSWER TO MY\nQUESTION, I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS DELIBERATE BUT SHE DID SOUND\nSTRONGER AND EVERYONE WHO IS ON THE TOM JOYNER MORNING SHOW SAID\nYOU DO SOUND STRONGER. THAT WAS RECORDED YESTERDAY.\nBUT SHE SEEMED TO, YOU KNOW, INTIMATE THAT SHE'S GOING TO\nRELEASE MORE RECORDS AS SHE DID YESTERDAY A DOCTOR'S LETTER.\nBUT I'M WONDERING FROM SANJAY WHAT ELSE CAN SHE RELEASE?\nIS THERE MORE? >> THE BIG QUESTION HAS BEEN,\nLOOK, ARE YOU GOING TO RELEASE RECORDS?\nARE YOU GOING TO RELEASE ESSENTIALLY WHAT IS A SUMMY DONE\nBY SOMEONE'S INTERPRETATION OF THOSE RECORDS WHO HAPPENS TO BE\nSOMEONE WHO YOU'RE COLLEGIAL WITH.\nYOUR DOCTOR/FRIEND SORT OF PERSON.\nAGAIN IT'S NOT TO SUGGEST THAT'S WHAT'S IN THOSE SUMMARIES IS\nINACCURATE BUT SOMETIMES THE REASON YOU LOOK AT MEDICAL\nRECORDS, BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW.\nYOU DON'T KNOW -- AND SO THERE ARE CERTAIN QUESTIONS THAT COME\nUP. FIRST OF ALL, TO ANSWER YOUR\nQUESTION, I DOUBT WE'RE GOING TO SEE ANYTHING MORE.\nI DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE ANYTHING MORE FROM HER --\n>> RAW DATA. >> RAW DATA.\n>> I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.\nBUT THAT'S BEEN SORT OF THE BIG QUESTION, BASICALLY THEY'VE MET\nTHE STANDARD THAT OTHER CAMPAIGNS HAVE HAD IN TERMS OF\nWHAT THEY HAVE -- >> EXCEPT JOHN McCAIN THEY\nREALLY HAVE. >> BUT YOU KNOW THE IDEA OF\nRELEASING MEDICAL RECORDS AND LETTING SOMEONE INDEPENDENT LOOK\nAT THOSE THINGS AND JUST MAKING SURE THAT ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT\nDETERMINE IF SOMEONE'S FIT TO LEAD ARE ANSWERED.\n>> LET'S BRING IN DAVID GREGORY, CNN'S POLITICAL ANALYST.\nDAVID, WHAT DID YOU HEAR IN DON'S INTERVIEW?\nI MEAN SHE TOUCHED A LOT OF BASES.\nSHE TALKED ABOUT RUSSIA, SHE TALKED ABOUT TAXES, SHE TALKED\nABOUT COLIN POWELL. WHAT DID YOU HEAR?\n>> WELL I WANT TO COME BACK TO RUSSIA IN JUST A SECOND.\nSANJAY SAID SOMETHING EARLIER THAT I THINK IS REALLY\nIMPORTANT. I THINK YOU WANT AS MUCH\nINFORMATION AS YOU CAN GET, AND TO YOUR POINT, ALISYN, YOU MAY\nNOT WANT, I HAVE IMAGES HERE OF MY MEDICAL RESULTS.\nSHALL WE SHOW THEM? >> NO, THANK YOU.\n>> I KNOW. BUT THE POINT IS, TO SANJAY'S\nPOINT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO DO ALL THAT BUT YOU WANT\nSOMEBODY WHO IS INDEPENDENT WHO CAN DO THIS KIND OF REVIEW.\nMcCAIN IS DIFFERENT. HE HAD CANCER.\nHE HAD MELANOMA. BUT I THINK MORE INFORMATION IS\nBETTER THAN LESS. I KEEP GETTING CAUGHT UP IN\nHILLARY CLINTON'S ARGUMENT THAT SHE WANTS TO BE COMPARED TO\nDONALD TRUMP. THAT'S NOT THE STANDARD.\nHIS DISCLOSURES ARE INSUFFICIENT.\nI THINK THAT CAN BE SAID OBJECTIVELY BASED ON PRECEDENT\nIN A PRESIDENTIAL RUN. BUT SHE SHOULD BE STILL\nRELEASING MORE, AND THE -- SHE SHOULD BE COMPARED TO WHAT IS\nREASONABLE IN THIS REGARD. AND AS MUCH AS YOU CAN PUT OUT\nIS APPROPRIATE AND SHOULD BE INDEPENDENTLY REVIEWED BY PEOPLE\nLIKE DR. GUPTA, AND OTHERS WHO HAVE DONE IT IN THE PAST WHO CAN\nMAKE A JUDGMENT. THE RUSSIA PIECE IS INTERESTING\nBECAUSE I THINK IT'S VERY GOOD POLITICS.\nIT HAPPENS TO BE REALLY FRIGHTENING THAT RUSSIA IS GOING\nTO THE LENGTHS THAT IT'S GOING TO POTENTIALLY INFLUENCE THE\nELECTION. TO HACK TOP PEOPLE IN THE\nCOUNTRY IN POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY, TO HACK THEIR\nE-MAILS. THAT SHOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT\nCONCERN. JUST AS CYBER TERROR AND CYBER\nCRIME SHOULD BE A CONCERN MORE GENERALLY IN OUR NATIONAL\nSECURITY. >> THERE'S ANOTHER PART OF THE\nINTERVIEW THAT AIRS. IT'S PROBABLY AIRING NOW BECAUSE\nTHEY TOOK A BREAK IN -- WHERE SHE TALKS ABOUT HER DEPLORABLES\nCOMMENT WHERE SHE DOUBLED DOWN ON THE HATE AND THE ALT-RIGHT\nAND WHAT SHE THIS DONALD TRUMP IS ATTRACTING --\n>> SHE'S NOT APOLOGIZING -- >> SHE'S NOT APOLOGIZING.\nSHE IN FACT USED THE WORD DEPLORABLE HERSELF.\nSHE SAID I HAVE CRITICIZED HIS DEPLORABLE -- I HAVE CRITICIZED\nHIS DEPLORABLE CAMPAIGN. SHE'S DOUBLING DOWN ON THAT --\n>> IT'S THE 50% SHE SAID SHE OVERREACHED.\n>> I THINK SHE'S PUSHING BACK BECAUSE SHE THIS SHE'S RIGHT ON\nTHIS ISSUE. AND I THINK SHE -- PEOPLE WERE A\nLITTLE BIT UPSET THAT THEY YOU KNOW SHE APPEARED TO BACK DOWN A\nLITTLE BIT. SO SHE DID DISCUSS THAT.\nBUT SHE KEEPS PUSHING TRANSPARENCY, RUSSIA, DONALD\nTRUMP IS NOT TRANSPARENT AS SHE IS, RUSSIA OR AT ALL SHE DOESN'T\nBELIEVE LESS SO THAN ANY OTHER CANDIDATE AND SHE IS NOT AGAIN\nNOT BACKING DOWN REALLY DOUBLING DOWN ON THE HATRED THAT SHE\nBELIEVES HE'S STIRRING UP -- >> THAT'S DIFFERENT.\nTHE DEPLORABLES IS ABOUT HIS OWN CAMPAIGN AND WHAT HE HAS SAID IS\nDIFFERENT THAN WHAT SHE SAID ABOUT HIS SUPPORTERS.\nI MEAN THAT'S WHERE PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WENT A BRIDGE TOO\nFAR. DID SHE SAY ANYTHING ABOUT HIS\nSUPPORTERS OR WAS SHE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN HE'S\nRUNNING? >> SHE SAID HIS CAMPAIGN.\nSHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT HIS SUPPORTERS.\n>> I THINK THAT'S DIFFERENT. >> IT'S ALWAYS BAD AS YOU KNOW,\nCOMING FROM A POLITICAL FAMILY, TO YOU KNOW, SAY BAD THINGS\nABOUT VOTERS EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT YOUR SUPPORTERS.\n>> YOU DON'T ATTACK -- >> ATTACK A CAMPAIGN BUT NOT THE\nVOTERS. >> JUST A HUMAN BEING, WHEN YOU\nATTACK SOMEBODY'S SUPPORT BASE IN ANYTHING YOU'RE MAKING A\nMISTAKE. ESPECIALLY WHAT WE'VE SEEN\nLEARNED IN THE PRIMARIES HERE THAT WHEN YOU DISRESPECT TRUMP,\nTHAT'S OKAY IF IT'S ON THE MERITS.\nWHEN YOU DISRESPECT PEOPLE FOR BELIEVING AND WANTING CHANGE AND\nBEING ANGRY ABOUT STATUS QUO YOU WIND UP BEING --\n>> I ALSO SPOKE WITH HER ABOUT THE POLLS AND SHE SAID YOU KNOW,\nSTANDARD ANSWER, I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THIS CAMPAIGN WAS GOING\nTO BE CLOSE. THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.\nBUT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT HILLARY CLINTON YOU KNOW\nHISTORY, HER RESUME, WHAT SHE'S DONE, HOW LONG SHE'S BEEN AROUND\nI MEAN YOU KNOW OBJECTIVELY YOU SHOULD SAY SHE SHOULD BE FURTHER\nAHEAD IN THE POLLS. IN A POLITICAL --\n>> EXCEPT THE GOP THIS IS THEIR RACE TO WIN.\n>> YEAH. >> CYCLICALLY THIS IS THEIR RACE\nTO WIN AND MANY ARGUE SHE'S -- >> HERTZ TO LOSE.\n>> THAT'S RIGHT. WELL THAT WAS THE PRESUMPTION\nNOW IN THIS PERIOD, IT CAN GO EITHER WAY.\nAND MANY PEOPLE SUGGEST YEAH SHE SHOULD BE BEATING TRUMP BECAUSE\nOF HER RESUME BUT IF SHE'D BEEN RUNNING AGAINST A JOHN KASICH\nSHE MAY HAVE HAD MORE THAN SHE COULD HANDLE WELL BEFORE THIS\nPOINT. >> EXACTLY.\n>> DAVID, WHAT ARE -- >> I'M JUST LOOKING AT OUR\nBANNER WHEN SHE SAYS THAT SHE ALWAYS KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE A\nCLOSE RACE. NO THAT'S NOT TRUE.\nI WAS LOOKING AT VIDEOTAPE JUST EARLIER ON YOUTUBE ABOUT SHE AND\nOTHERS IN THE MEDIA SAYING THAT TRUMP WAS -- WAS A JOKE THAT HE\nWASN'T A SERIOUS CANDIDATE. SO YOU CAN'T SAY YOU ALWAYS\nTHOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE CLOSE.\nAND THE REALITY IS IN GOING AFTER SOME OF HIS SUPPORTERS,\nSOME OF WHICH IS CERTAINLY ACCURATE IN TERMS OF THE VIEWS\nOF SOME OF HIS SUPPORTERS, WHETHER THEY'RE ANTI-SEMITIC OR\nRACIST OR HOMOPHOBIC OR ISLAMAPHOBIC, THAT IS JUST TRUE.\nAND THE TRUTH IS THAT TRUMP HAS NOT STOOD UP TO SOME OF THOSE\nPEOPLE. ANTI-SEMITES, FOR EXAMPLE, GIVEN\nTHE FACT THAT HE HAS A JEWISH GRANDSON, AND HAS NOT STOOD UP\nTO THOSE PEOPLE WITHIN HIS OWN CAMPAIGN.\nSO, SHE'S GOT REASON TO DO THAT BUT THE POINT IS, IT'S GLOSSING\nOVER THE FACT WHEN SHE MADE A COMMENT LIKE THAT --\n>> HE HAS A JEWISH DAUGHTER. SHE CONVERTED.\n>> PRECISELY. -- AND AS YOU KNOW I MEAN\nCONVERTS IN THE JEWISH HELD UP ABOVE ALL IN THE BIBLE.\nBUT THE POINT IS THERE ARE CERTAINLY THERE ARE FACTORS HERE\nABOUT THE SUPPORT FOR TRUMP THAT GO WELL BEYOND THAT.\nAND OF COURSE NOBODY LIKES TO BELIEVE ABOUT THEMSELVES THAT\nTHEY MAY BE BIASED OR RACIST, OR IN ANY WAY AND SO THAT'S WHY\nTHAT JUST KIND OF MISSED THE MARK ON HER POINT OF WHAT SHE\nWAS TRYING TO SAY. >> WE HAVE THAT PART DAVID LET'S\nLISTEN TO IT. >> DONALD TRUMP HAS RUN A\nDEPLORABLE CAMPAIGN. HE HAS ACCEPTED SUPPORT AND BEEN\nCHEERED ON BY THE LIKES OF DAVID DUKE, THE FORMER GRAND WIZARD OF\nTHE KU KLUX KLAN AND OTHER WHITE SUPREMACISTS.\nIN FACT, IT WAS AMAZING THE OTHER DAY HIS RUNNING MATE, MIKE\nPENCE, WOULDN'T EVEN CALL FORMER KKK LEADER DAVID DUKE\nDEPLORABLE. AND, AND I DO THINK WE HAVE TO\nSPEAK OUT AGAINST THIS HATRED. YOU KNOW TRUMP ATTACKED A\nFEDERAL JUDGE FOR HIS MEXICAN HERITAGE.\nHE -- HE BULLIED A GOLD STAR FAMILY BECAUSE OF THEIR MUSLIM\nFAITH. HE PROMOTED THE LIE, AND HE\nSTILL IS PROMOTING THE LIE, THAT OUR FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT IS NOT\nA TRUE AMERICAN. >> HMM.\n>> HE CALLS WOMEN PIGS AND BIMBOS.\nSO, -- >> YEAH.\nAND IT'S TRUE AND THAT'S YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK THAT MAYBE\nTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS A LITTLE BIT TONE DEAF THEY THEY AT LEAST\nTHEY SAY THAT THEY DON'T THINK THAT THE BIRTHER THING IS A BIG\nDEAL AND WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE JOBS AND\nWHATEVER. OF COURSE THAT'S IMPORTANT.\nBUT, BY DOING WHAT DONALD TRUMP DID WITH THE BIRTHER THING,\nTAKING IT BEYOND WHEREVER IT STARTED, SENDING PEOPLE TO\nAFRICA, INVESTIGATORS AT LEAST HIM SAYING THAT, DOUBLING AND\nTRIPLING DOWN ON THAT, AND THEN SAYING HE DIDN'T BELIEVE THE\nBIRTH CERTIFICATE WAS ACCURATE. THAT INSULTED 99.999% OF\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS. HE MAY NOT SEE IT AS RACIAL.\nMAYBE THAT WAS NOT HIS INTENT. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT -- I DO\nBELIEVE THAT THAT WAS -- THAT WAS THE RESULT, WHETHER OR NOT\nTHAT WAS HIS OBVIOUS INTENT. AND SO THAT'S INSULTING TO\nAFRICAN-AMERICANS AND HE STILL HAS YET TO APOLOGIZE FOR THAT\nAND I THINK THAT IS GOING TO HURT HIM WHEN IT COMES TO BLACK\nSUPPORT. >> HE APPARENTLY STILL BELIEVES\nIT. HE NOT ONLY HAS APOLOGIZED\nTHERE'S NO INDICATION THAT HE DOESN'T STILL BELIEVE THAT.\n>> RUDY GIULIANI AND HIS SURROGATES SAY HE BELIEVES THE\nPRESIDENT WAS BORN IN THE UNITED STATES BUT HE HAS YET TO SAY\nTHAT -- >> RIGHT.\n>> THE POINT IS THAT I THINK DON AS YOU POINT OUT THIS WAS ABSURD\nTHAT HE EVER WOULD ADVANCE THIS NOTION AND HE WANTS TO BE\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME, YOU'RE\nINTERVIEW WITH HILLARY CLINTON AND WHAT SHE SAID HOW SHE BROKE\nDOWN THOSE EXAMPLES THEY'VE GOT AN AD UP I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S IN\nTHE BATTLEGROUNDS, IT WAS CERTAINLY ON NATIONAL CABLE I\nSAW IT ON OUR AIR IN WHICH SHE TAKE HIS CRITICISM OF HER, THAT\nSHE'S INSULTED YOU KNOW SEGMENTS OF THE ELECTORATE, WHICH SHE DID\nIN THAT BASKET OF DEPLORABLES REMARK, AND THEN SHOWS ALL OF\nTHE EXAMPLES THAT SHE LISTED TO YOU AND SAYS, RIGHT, WE AGREE\nWITH HIM EXACTLY YOU SHOULDN'T DO THAT.\nSO I THINK SHE'S WILLING TO TAKE HER LUMPS, THAT THIS WAS\nSOMETHING THAT SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID.\nSHE OFFENDED SOME PEOPLE. BUT, YOU KNOW, WHETHER IT HAD\nSOME RESONANCE IN THE POLLS AGAINST HER WE'RE GOING TO FIND\nOUT. BUT SHE'S TRYING TO COUNTERPUNCH\nHERE BY BRINGING UP ALL THESE AREAS WHERE HE SAID AND BELIEVED\nWHAT HE BELIEVES. >> DAVID, SANJAY, DON, THANK YOU\nDON THANKS SO FOR SHARING THAT INTERVIEW WITH US.\nALL RIGHT THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION AND CLINTON FOUNDATION UNDER THE\nMICROSCOPE TODAY SO WE'RE TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT BOTH OF THEM\nTHIS MORNING STARTING WITH WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN TO DONALD TRUMP'S\nORGANIZATION IF HE IS ELECTED PRESIDENT.\nWE DISCUSS THAT NEXT.",

SOMETHING THAT WE HAVEN'T\nINVESTIGATED VERY THOROUGHLY BUT ARE SEEING IT IN TODAY'S\n\"NEWSWEEK\" ARTICLE. WE ARE SEEING THAT THE TRUMP\nORGANIZATION HAS BUSINESS TIES ALL AROUND THE GLOBE WITH VERY\nPOWERFUL BUSINESSMEN. THESE BUSINESSMEN AT SOME TIMES\nHAVE, THEY ARE AT ODDS WITH THEIR GOVERNMENT.\nTHE QUESTION IS RIGHT NOW FOR DONALD TRUMP, WHO HAS ALL OF\nTHIS BUSINESS WITH THESE FOREIGN COUNTRIES, WILL FOREIGN LEADERS\nNOW MAKE DECISIONS BASED UPON DONALD TRUMP'S WANTING FOR HIS\nPRIVATE BUSINESS HOPING TO INFLUENCE U.S. FOREIGN POLICY\nWHICH IS A VERY VERY BIG QUESTION.\nALSO, THE QUESTION IS, WHEN DONALD TRUMP SAID THAT HE WOULD\nHAND THIS OVER IN A BLIND TRUST TO HIS FAMILY, THEY POINT OUT\nTHAT DOESN'T MATTER. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS IF\nTRUMP'S FAMILY IS RUNNING THE COMPANY, THERE IS STILL GOING TO\nBE AN EFFORT BY THESE FOREIGN LEADERS TO TRY TO INFLUENCE U.S.\nFOREIGN POLICY ON SOME MAJOR DECISIONS, KNOWING FULL WELL HIS\nCOMPANY WOULD BENEFIT FINANCIALLY FROM IT.\nWHAT IS REALLY TROUBLING IS IN THE CASE OF TURKEY RIGHT NOW,\nWHERE YOU HAVE THE PRESIDENT OF TURKEY WHO IS NOT VERY HAPPY\nWITH DONALD TRUMP, AND EICHENWALD SAYS HE'S BEEN TOLD\nBY TURKISH LEADERS THAT IF TRUMP WERE ELECTED PRESIDENT, THEN IN\nFACT, WE COULD IMPERIL THE USE OF THE U.S. AIR BASE THAT IS\nBEING USED RIGHT NOW BY U.S. BOMBERS TO TARGET ISIS.\nIT'S DEFINITELY A VERY COMPLICATED THING AND CERTAINLY\nANOTHER ISSUE, MAJOR ISSUE, ONLY 55 DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION.\n>> IN AN UNCOMPLICATED WAY, YOU SAID IT REALLY WELL.\nHE CONTINUES TO POINT TO PUTTING IT INTO A BLIND TRUST, HIS\nDAUGHTER EVEN THIS MORNING SAYS AND WE WOULD RUN IT.\nTHAT'S KIND OF UNBLIND TRUST OF THE BLIND TRUST.\n>> RIGHT. IT SEEMS COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE\nIN A WAY TO DISENTANGLE YOURSELF, YOUR BUSINESS, YOUR\nFAMILY, GIVEN THESE INTERNATIONAL CONFLICTS, FROM\nBECOMING -- FROM BEING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nIT'S VERY DIFFICULT. NOW, WE HAVE HEARD DONALD TRUMP\nTALK ABOUT SHUTTING DOWN THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.\nSHUT IT DOWN. WELL, DEMOCRATS CAN NOW RAISE\nTHE POINT SHUT THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION DOWN IF THEY WANT,\nIF MORE REPORTING SHOWS, AND THIS IS WELL REPORTED BUT IF\nMORE REPORTING COMES OUT THAT THERE IS SUCH A DEEP\nENTANGLEMENT HERE THAT HOW WOULD YOU POSSIBLY TAKE YOURSELF AND\nYOUR FOREIGN POLICY OUT OF THAT WHOLE MIX?\n>> LOOK, IF TRUMP'S SAYING WITH THE CLINTON FOUNDATION SHUT IT\nDOWN NOW, DIDN'T HE SET HIMSELF UP FOR EXACTLY THAT REQUEST?\n>> I WOULD VENTURE TO SAY HILLARY CLINTON WOULD NOT SAY\nSHUT IT DOWN AND PUT WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS THOUSAND PEOPLE\nOUT OF BUSINESS. >> THAT WOULD PUT A LOT OF\nPEOPLE OUT OF BUSINESS IF THEY SHUT DOWN THE CLINTON\nFOUNDATION. >> I DON'T THINK AS MUCH.\nTHEY SAID OTHER NONPROFITS WOULD BE IN POSITION TO TAKE OVER SOME\nOF THE GOOD WORK THE CLINTON FOUNDATION HAS DONE.\n>> THE ISSUE IS THIS. DOESN'T THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN OWE\nIT TO VOTERS TO EXPLAIN TO THEM HOW THERE WOULD BE A DIVISION\nBETWEEN THE TRUMP CORPORATION AND THE WHITE HOUSE?\n>> I'M GLAD YOU ASKED THAT. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAME UP\nIN THE PRIMARY AS EARLY AS I THINK I WANT TO SAY JANUARY OR\nFEBRUARY. HE'S ALWAYS BEEN CONSISTENT AND\nSAID LOOK, I KNOW, I'M TELLING YOU I HAVE AN EMPIRE OF\nPROPERTIES ALL OVER THE WORLD AND WHEN I DO BECOME PRESIDENT I\nHAVE TO DISMANTLE IT. >> THAT'S NOT DISMANTLED --\n>> PASS IT OFF TO MY CHILDREN AND HAVE THEM RUN THE COMPANY\nAND HE HAS SAID HE'S NOT GOING TO TAKE A ROLE IN THE COMPANY.\nTHAT HAS BEEN THE POSITION -- >> HOW DOES THAT INOCULATE HIM?\nTHEY ARE HIS KIDS AND ARE SOME OF HIS CHIEF POLICY ADVISERS\nRIGHT NOW. >> I DON'T THINK IF THEY WOULD\nBE HIS CHIEF POLICY ADVISERS AND HAVE A FIDUCIARY DUTY.\n>> IVANKA TRUMP HAS CONCEPTUALIZED THE CHILD CARE\nPOLICY. YOU DON'T THINK THERE WOULD BE A\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST IF THEY RAN THESE COMPANIES AND ARE THE\nARCHITECTS OF THESE POLICIES? >> LET'S BE OBJECTIVE.\nTRUMP HAS BEEN KIND OF TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE SINCE HE GOT\nINTO THE ELECTION. PEOPLE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT IT.\nTHIS IS NOT -- I MEAN, I GUESS IT'S A NEW NEWS STORY BUT THIS\nIS REHASHING SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED ALREADY.\n>> IF THERE WAS A CLEAR ANSWER ON HOW IT WOULD BE DISMANTLED OR\nSHUT DOWN OR DIVIDED THE STORY WOULD BE OVER.\n>> PAUL, YOU GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS?\n>> OH, YEAH. HE NEEDS TO RELEASE HIS TAX\nRETURNS. THIS IS WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT.\nIF YOU TELL ME WHO YOU OWE MONEY TO, I WILL TELL YOU WHO YOU ARE\nGOING TO OWE LOYALTY TO. WE DON'T KNOW WHO TRUMP IS IN\nBUSINESS WITH, WE DON'T KNOW WHO IS FINANCING HIM.\nWE DON'T KNOW. VOTERS HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW.\nMR. TRUMP HAS DECIDED THEY DON'T.\nTHAT MAKES THIS A REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE.\nTHIS IS A REALLY CLEAR ONE. HILLARY HAD A BRIEF MEDICAL\nRELEASE WE TALKED ABOUT. TRUMP HAD AN EVEN BRIEFER ONE.\nOKAY. SLIGHT WIN FOR --\n[ SPEAKING SIMULTANEOUSLY ] >> -- OBAMA --\n>> CHARITY WATCH INDEPENDENT GROUP THAT RATES THESE THINGS.\nHEAD OF CHARITY WATCH SAYS THIS IS ONE OF THE GREAT FOUNDATIONS\nOF OUR GENERATION.

RUN ACROSS THE LAWN OF THE\nFLINT, MICHIGAN WATER TREATMENT PLANT.\nTHE REASON OUR POOR CAMERA CREW IS IN SUCH A HURRY RUNNING\nACROSS THE LAWN WITH ALL THE OTHER REPORTERS AND\nPHOTOGRAPHERS WAS BECAUSE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE DONALD\nTRUMP WAS THERE. THE MAYOR OF FLINT TRIED TO\nDISCOURAGE TRUMP FROM VISITING FLINT.\nSHE PUT OUT A STATEMENT SAYING THAT NEITHER DONALD TRUMP NOR\nANY STAFF MEMBERS FROM THE TUMP CAMPAIGN HAVE REACHED OUT.\nTHE CITY OF FLINT EMPLOYEES ARE FOCUSED ON DEALING WITH THE\nCONTINUED CONTAMINATION IN THE DRINKING WATER AND CANNOT AFFORD\nTHE LAST-MINUTE VISIT.

I KNOW YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT,\nBUT IT'S STILL NOT HAPPENING, THEY'RE STILL NOT BRINGING WATER\nDOOR TO DOOR IN FLINT RIGHT NOW. CONGRESS MAY BE ON THE VERGE OF\nDOING SOMETHING TO HELP THEM. THE FINAL VOTE MAY HAPPEN AS\nSOON AS TOMORROW. THE QUESTION THEN IS WHETHER THE\nREPUBLICAN CONTROLLED HOUSE COULD BE PERSUADED TO SIGN SIGN\nWATER INFRASTRUCTURE HILL.

FLINT, OF COURSE, WHERE\nLEAD-TAINTED WATER BECAME A MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS.\nTHE GOP NOMINEE'S VISIT COMES AT A TIME WHEN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY\nIS REPORTEDLY LOSING WHITE VOTERS.\nA NEW PEW POLL SHOWING 57% OF ALL DEMOCRATIC VOTERS ARE WHITE\nDOWN FROM 76% IN 1992. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BY CONTRAST\nHAS SEEN ONLY A 7-POINT DROP IN WHITE VOTERS OVER THE SAME\nPERIOD OF TIME. RUTH PEYTON IS THE POP CULTURE\nWRITER FOR THE FEDERALIST AND RICHARD FOWLER, DEMOCRATIC\nSTRATEGIST AND RADIO TALK SHOW HOST.\nWHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS, RICHARD FOWLER, I'LL GO TO YOU\nFIRST -- >> HEY SANDRA.\n>> WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THE\nDEMOGRAPHICS SEEMS TO REALLY BE CHANGING ON BOTH SIDES?\n>> WELL, AMERICA'S DEMOGRAPHICS ARE CHANGING, SANDRA, OUR\nCOUNTRY IS BECOMING A MORE AND MORE DIVERSE PLACE, AS THE\nDEMOCRATIC PARTY BECOMES MORE DIVERSE AND TALK TO NEW\nPOPULATION, LATINOS OR AFRICAN AMERICANS OR THE PACIFIC\nISLANDERS. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S BECOMING\nMORE HOMOGENEOUS, WHICH EXPLAINS THE RISE OF SOMEBODY LIKE A\nDONALD TRUMP OVER A MARCO RUBIO IN THE PRIMARY.\n>> FAIR ENOUGH, AND BREE, DONALD TRUMP, THIS IS HIS SECOND VISIT\nTO MICHIGAN THIS MONTH ALONE. HE'S OBVIOUSLY MAKING A BIG\nPOINT TO BE THERE. EARLIER THIS MONTH, HE ATTENDED\nSERVICES AT GREAT FAITH MINISTRIES INTERNATIONAL CHURCH.\nTHIS AS WE DO SEE THE NUMBERS SHOWING THAT CHRISTIANS ARE\nLEAVING THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. >> YEAH, DEFINITELY.\nI THINK THAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY CERTAINLY DOES TALK ABOUT\nRE IMPORTANT TO NOT ONLY MINORITY VOTERS, BUT ALSO\nYOUNG VOTERS A LOT MORE OFTEN THAN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY DOES.\nTHROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE PRIMARY CYCLE WITH THE GOP, YOU KNOW,\nSTUDENT LOANS, WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE TO YOUNG VOTERS\nAS WELL AS THE CRISIS GOING ON WITH THE WATER IN FLINT, GABBY\nGIFFORDS, WAS NOT REALLY BROUGHT UP THAT OFTEN.\nAND SO I THINK THESE CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS THAT WE'RE NOW\nSEEING IS JUST A VERY APPARENT REAL LIFE CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR\nDECISION TO IGNORE THESE ISSUES AND KIND OF PRETEND LIKE THEY'RE\nNOT HAPPENING. >> ANOTHER IMPORTANT ISSUE,\nRICHARD, IS ISSUE FOR VOTERS, OBAMACARE.\nNEW CENSUS NUMBERS SHOWING A TROUBLING TREND WHEN IT COMES TO\nOBAMACARE, ACCORDING TO TO THE SUPPLEMENTAL POVERTY MEASURE,\nTHE STEEP COST OF HEALTH CARE CONTINUING TO PUSH MILLIONS OF\nAMERICANS INTO POVERTY, AND NEW POLLS SUGGEST THAT MAY BE\nHELPING REPUBLICANS UP FOR REELECTION THIS YEAR.\nRICHARD. >> SO THE KIZER FAMILY\nFOUNDATION ALSO RELEASED A REPORT A COUPLE WEEKS AGO\nINDICATING THAT MORE AND MORE EMPLOYERS ARE PROVIDING\nFULL-TIME HOURS TO FOLKS THEY CAN ACTUALLY GET HEALTH CARE\nINSURANCE. WHICH IS A GREAT THING.\nRIGHT NOW WHAT WE'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH THE IS THE FACT THAT\nINSURANCE COMPANIES CONTINUE TO RAISE PREMIUMS, EVEN THOUGH THEY\nKNOW THAT IT DOESN'T BENEFIT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\nWHICH IS WHY THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS JUST ONE STEP IN THE\nRIGHT DIRECTION AND HOPEFULLY, IF, YOU KNOW, DEMOCRATS TAKE\nCONTROL OF THE SENATE AND WE WIN THE WHITE HOUSE, WE'LL HAVE A\nCHANCE TO TAKE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ANOTHER STEP, RIGHT?\nFIGURING OUT HOW WE FIX SOME OF THE PROBLEMS.\nHOW WE REGULATE INSURANCE COMPANIES SO THEY DON'T CONTINUE\nTO CHARGE AMERICANS OUT THE WITH A ZOO FOR PREMIUMS.\nNOW ON DONALD TRUMP'S VISIT TO FLINT, WHICH I THINK IS VERY\nIMPORTANT TO NOTE, MIND YOU, THIS IS A MAN-MADE CRISIS,\nCREATED BY GOVERNMENT. IT'S AN ATROCITY, RIGHT, AND IT\nTOOK DONALD TRUMP TWO YEARS TO FINALLY SHOW UP IN FLINT,\nMICHIGAN. THE QUESTION THAT THE PEOPLE IN\nFLINT ARE ASKING IS WHY THE HELL DID IT TAKE YOU SO LONG?\n>> ACTUALLY, THEY'RE NOT VERY WELCOME TO HIM BEING THERE.\nWE'RE NOT UP FAR PHOTO OP -- >> BECAUSE THE PEOPLE ARE BEING\nEXPLOITED. >> NEED TO POINT THAT OUT, BUT I\nWANT TO GET BACK TO THE ISSUE OF OBAMACARE.\nI WANT TO GET BREE'S TAKE ON THIS AS WELL, THIS MAP CLEARLY\nSHOWING THE TREND THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE, SHOWING\nSTATES EXITING FROM OBAMACARE, WHICH HAPPENED BY THE WAY TO BE\nSOME OEF TH BSTIGGEATROTL BUNEGD STATES FOR SENATE REPUBLICANS\nTHIS YEAR, ILLINOIS, WISCONSIN, PENNSYLVANIA, FLORIDA, NORTH\nCAROLINA AMONG THEM. SOME BIG STATES TO WATCH THERE,\nBREE. >> YEAH, DEFINITELY.\nAND I THINK WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE REASON WHY THEY ARE\nCAUSING MORE -- CHARGING MORE AND MORE FOR THEIR PREMIUMS.\nTHEY'RE CHARGING MORE FOR HEALTH CARE BECAUSE HEALTH CARE IS\nGETTING MORE AND MORE EXPENSIVE. WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT.\nTHE OVERALL HEALTH CARE MARKETPLACE IS BECOMING\nINCREASINGLY UNSTABLE SINCE 2009 BECAUSE OF THIS.\nMY DAD, WHO OWNS THE SMALL MANUFACTURING COMPANY EVERY\nSINGLE YEAR WHEN HE HAS TO RENEW THE HEALTH INSURANCE POLICY FOR\nHIS EMPLOYEES, THE CONVERSATION WITH HIS INSURANCE BROKER ALWAYS\nGOES LIKE THIS. HE ALWAYS SAYS, I'M NOT SURE IF\nI'M GOING TO STAY IN BUSINESS NEXT YEAR, BE ABLE TO OFFER\nHEALTH CARE PREMIUMS TO YOU. YOUR EMPLOYEES MAY HAVE TO ENTER\nINTO THE EXCHANGE. SO THIS IS ONE ANECDOTAL STORY\nIN A BLEAK PICTURE FOR AMERICANS IN REGARDS TO HEALTH CARE.\nAND CERTAINLY ON ELECTION DAY IN THOSE STATES WHERE THIS IS\nBECOMING AN ISSUE, WHERE INSURERS ARE PULLING OUT AND\nPULLING OUT AND NOT OFFERING HEALTH INSURANCE TO THEIR\nCUSTOMERS, I THINK WE DEFINITELY WILL SEE SOME BACKLASH IN THE\nPOLLS ON ELECTION DAY. >> BUT THE BACKLASH REALLY GOES\nTO THE INSURERS. RIGHT, THEY DON'T WANT TO MAKE\nPROFITS. >> CLEARLY, IT'S AN ISSUE FOR\nBOTH OF YOU. IT'S AN ISSUE FOR A LOT OF\nVOTERS.",

ONE INPUT THAT PREDOMINATES, I\nTHINK, FALSELY, IS THE PRICE OF OIL.\nWE'VE BEEN TRAPPED IN THIS MACROWORLD AS MEASURED BY\nCOMMODITY PRICING MEANING BIGGER FUND MANAGERS LOOK AT OIL AS A\nVIRTUAL THERMOMETER. ANY TIME THE PRICE OF OIL DROPS\nAS IT DID TODAY, PLUMMETING $1.26 DOWN TO $43.64 ANY TIME\nOILS RALLY, THAT'S A SIGN DEMAND IS PICKING UP.\nI MEAN RIDICULOUS. THIS IS RIDICULOUS.\nTHE PRICE OF CRUDE IS THE SUM OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND, OKAY?\nWITH SUPPLY READY TO OVERWHELM ANY DEMAND, EVEN DEMAND THAT'S\n10, 15, 20% STRONGER THAN IT IS NOW.\nWHEN U.S. OIL INVENTORIES DROP AS THEY DID TODAY, YOU HAVE A\nFLEETING RALLY IN CRUDE AND THEN A DECLINE BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE\nTHAT THERE'S STILL A GLUT. TOO MUCH OIL BEING PRODUCED.\nLATER AS OIL HEADS TO $40 FROM $43, YOU THEN GET A REBOUND\nBECAUSE THE COUNTRIES THAT WANT THE PRICE HIGHER SPREAD RUMORS\nOF AN EMERGENCY OPEC MEETING TO FREEZE PRODUCTION.\nTHIS RUMOR MONGERING WORKS LIKE A CHARM EVERY TIME.\nIN OTHER WORDS, THE PRICE OF OIL, IT'S MANIPULATED.\nIT'S BOGUS. AND IT HAS LITTLE TO NOTHING TO\nDO WITH THE REAL DEMAND WE NEED TO CALCULATE TO MAKE OUR WORLD\nVIEW, EVEN AS IT'S THE METRIC OF CHOICE FOR SO MANY FUND\nMANAGERS. OTHERS USE THE PRICE OF METALS\nLIKE COPPER AND STEEL. ONE OF THE REASONS IS COPPER HAS\nBEEN DISPLACED BY OTHER MATERIALS.\nIT'S AN INDICATOR OF NOTHING. SO WHAT AM I LOOKING AT?\nIN THE U.S. FIRST IT'S EMPLOYMENT.\nI'M STILL ENCOURAGED. I THINK EMPLOYMENT IS RELATIVELY\nSTRONG. IT'S WHY I DON'T FEAR A RATE\nHIKE AS MUCH AS OTHERS. THAT'S BASED ON MY FORECAST BAY\nLOOKING BACK AT WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE FED TIGHTENED IN\nSEPTEMBER. NEXT I LOOK AT HOUSING.\nHOUSING DEMAND REMAINS STRONG IN THIS COUNTRY.\nWE'RE TALKING TO TOLL BROTHERS LATER TONIGHT AND THEIR VIEW IS\nPRETTY POSITIVE ON THAT LATEST CONFERENCE CALL.\nWHEN HOUSING IS ROBUST, THAT MEANS SPENDING TO FIX UP A HOUSE\nIS STRONG, AND THAT'S A MAJOR PIECE OF OUR HUGE RETAIL\nECONOMY. HOW ABOUT NON-REALLY\nCONSTRUCTION? BIG CHUNK.\nBIG CHUNK OF THE BUSINESS. I SPEAK TO SEVERAL COMPANIES IN\nEVERY SILO OF NON-REALLY FROM THE CONSTRUCTION LOANS IN ALL\nGEOGRAPHIES TO THE MATERIALS NEEDED TO ERECT BUILDINGS TO THE\nFIXTURES, HEATING, AIR-CONDITIONING, LIGHTING,\nVENTILATION COMPANIES. MY JUDGMENT?\nTHINGS ARE PRETTY GOOD. WHILE I DON'T LIKE THE\nAUTOMOBILE STOCKS BECAUSE THE WORLDWIDE ENTERPRISE ISN'T AS\nHEALTHY AS I'D LIKE AS I JUST SAID, THE DEMAND IN THE U.S. IS\nSTRONG WITH SUVs AND TRUCKS SELLING VERY WELL.\nAEROSPACE, STRONG OUT OF BOEING TODAY.\nAT THE ACTUAL STORE LEVEL, IT IS MIXED, NOT TERRIBLE.\nCASUAL DINING IS NOT GOOD. LOOK AT CRACKER BARREL DOWN $10\nTODAY. BUT SOME OF THAT IS BECAUSE IT'S\nJUST A LOT CHEAPER TO STAY HOME THANKS TO THE DECLINE IN THE\nPRICE OF FOOD MENTIONED ON THE CRACKER BARREL CALL.\nI BELIEVE THERE'S ALSO BEEN A TAMPING OF DEMAND FROM INCREASED\nHEALTH CARE BILLS. RETAILERS, HIT OR MISS.\nWE SEE STRENGTH OF WALMART AND AMAZON WHICH ARE A HUGE PART OF\nTHE RETAIL EQUATION. DEPARTMENT STORES, NOT GREAT ALL\nWE WE HAD A KEY UP GRADE AT MACY'S TODAY.\nBACK TO SCHOOL, NOT BAD AT ALL. GO --\nAND THEN THERE'S PERHAPS THE MOST OVERLOOKED GAUGE OF DEMAND\nIN THIS COUNTRY, AND THAT'S THE HUGE AND, YES, ENTIRELY\nUNEXPECTED INCREASE IN ORDERS FOR APPLE'S SUPPOSEDLY BLAH\niPHONE 7. WHEN YOU HAVE SPRINT AND\nT-MOBILE SAYING THEY HAVE OFF THE CHART DEMANDS FOR THE PHONE,\nWHEN AT&T TELLS US TODAY THAT DEMAND IS BETTER THAN EXPECTED\nAND VERIZON SAYS IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE PREDICTIONS CEO LOWELL\nMcADAM MADE ON THIS SHOW, THAT THE iPHONE IS INDEED SELLING\nVERY WELL, THEN IT'S AN ACTUAL NEEDLE MOVER.\nHENCE THE TERRIFIC RUN IN APPLE STOCK.\nTHE SESSION'S LEADER. WE KNOW THAT MILLENNIALS NOW\nREPRESENT ABOUT HALF THE CONSUMER DEMAND IN THIS COUNTRY\nAND THEY SPEND ON WAY DIFFERENT THINGS THAN OTHER GENERATIONS\nINCLUDING MY OWN. THEY LIKE EXPERIENCES.\nTHEY LIKE GAMES. WHAT CAN YOU PLAY THE MOST\nHIGH-POWERED GAMES ON? THE iPHONE 7.\nHOW DO YOU SHARE YOUR EXPENSES BEST?\nWITH BEAUTIFUL PICTURES TAKEN ON YOUR BRAND-NEW iPHONE.\nYOU HAVE A BILLION iPHONE USERS AND THEY'RE WILLING TO SPEND\nHUNDREDS OF DOLLARS ON THEIR PHONES, THESE NEW ONES THAT THEY\nOTHERWISE WOULD SPEND ON SOMETHING ELSE BECAUSE THEY WANT\nTHE PROCESSING POWER. THEY WANT THE SPEED.\nTHAT'S PURE DEMAND. NOW, I KNOW THAT MY MOSAIC SEEMS\nNOTHING BUT A SERIES OF ANECDOTES.\nWE WANT SOMEONE FROM A -- WE WANT A COMMERCE DEPARTMENT\nNUMBER TO CAPTURE WHAT I JUST PUT TOGETHER.\nWE WANT SOME GRAND INQUISITOR TO ASK QUESTIONS AND MAKE SENSE OF\nEVERYTHING AND THEN MIND MELD IT WITH AN ALGORITHM THAT SHOWS US\nWHAT THE ECONOMY WILL DO GIVEN THAT SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES.\nTHAT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN. YOU'RE STUCK WITH MY ANECDOTES.\nHERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE, THOUGH. THE PLURAL OF ANECDOTE IS DATA,\nAND BASED ON THE DATA, I THINK WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH DEMAND TO\nKEEP THE MARKET FROM GOING LOWER.\nBUT WE DO HAVE ENOUGH DEMAND TO CONTAIN THE DECLINE TO LEVELS\nTHAT AREN'T DANGEROUS. THAT'S WHY I KEEP TELLING YOU TO\nSTAY THE COURSE, BECAUSE IT WILL ULTIMATELY BE TOO HARD TO GET\nOUT AND THEN GET BACK IN AT LOWER LEVELS.\nDEPESH IN TENNESSEE, DEPESH? >> Caller: YES, MR. CRAMER.\nTHANKS FOR TAKING MY CALL. I HAVE A QUICK QUESTION ABOUT\nMONSANTO.  TRADING AT 106 AND 107.\nIS THE RIGHT TIME TO BUY? >> NO, I DON'T WANT TO BUY\nBECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE THE DEAL IS GOING TO GO THROUGH.\nI THINK THE FARMERS WILL FIGHT IT, AND THE COMPANIES THEMSELVES\nMAY BE MISJUDGING THE OPPOSITION BY THE FARMERS.\nMIKE IN MONTANA, MIKE. >> Caller: THANKS FOR TAKING MY\nCALL. >> OF COURSE.\n>> Caller: I'M AN INVESTOR IN MET LIFE, AND THEY ARE SEEKING\nTO EXIT A U.S. RETAIL UNIT.

JUST BECAUSE T-MOBILE, THE\nTHIRD-LARGEST CARRIER IN THE U.S. SAYS THEY'RE UP FOR X --\nTHERE ARE SUBSCRIBERS WHO HAVE GONE FROM $23 MILLION IN 2013 TO\n$31 MILLION. THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR\nTHEM TO GET PEOPLE TO SWITCH FROM OTHER CARRIERS.\nAND THEY'RE DOING TRADE-INS, ALL OF THIS STUFF.\nTO ME, THAT'S ALL GOOD FOR APPLE.\nBUT IT'S NOT -- EASY, I THINK, TO EXTRAPOLATE TO WHAT'S\nREQUESTING GOING ON WITH 150 MILLION SUBS THAT AT&T AND\nVERIZON HAVE. >> ONE OTHER THING, THOUGH.\nWE TALKED ABOUT THE DISCIPLINE OF NOT PUTTING SO MUCH EFFORT\nINTO THE CAR -- THE CAR BUSINESS, I THINK, IS SMART.\n>> SO COST DISCIPLINE.

JUST ABOUT EVERY ONE OF THEM\nTHAT'S VERY DEPENDENT ON APPLE, SOME OF THESE SKYWORKS, YOU LOOK\nAT WHAT THEIR NUMBERS ARE AND YOU SAY, HOLY SMOKES, THEY HAVE\nBEEN TELLING US THAT DEMAND FROM APPLE IS STRONG.\nAND SO IF THAT'S THE CASE, AND WE ALL KNOW THAT TLS, WHEN YOU\nLOOK AT SOME OF THE NUMBERS COMING OUT OF THOSE CHIP MAKERS,\nTHAT SAYS A LOT ABOUT WHERE THIS PHONE IS, AS WELL.\nSO TO YOUR POINT SAYING, WELL, AT&T -- I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO\nBE VERY, VERY SURPRISED WHEN THE NUMBERS ACTUALLY COME OUT.\n>> I THINK THIS IS A MARKET PHENOMENON.\nTHIS IS TOTALLY A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE -- OVERWHELMED BY\nVALUATIONS.

SO GOOGLE.\n>> DAN? >> I AGREE WITH THAT.\nI THINK GOOGLE, YOU KNOW, RELATIVE TO THEIR EXPECTED\nGROWTH, NORTH OF 20% FOR EPS AND SALES TOO AT -- WHERE IT'S\nTRADING HERE TO ME, MAKES TOTAL SENSE.\nTHAT BEING SAID, I'M GOING TO TELL YOU GUYS THIS.\nYOU MAY FALL OFF YOUR CHAIRS HERE.\nI WAS VERY NEAR READY TO BUY APPLE.\n>> WHEN? >> IF IT GOT TO A NINE HANDLE.\n>> WHY DIDN'T YOU, THOUGH?

I ACTUALLY THINK THAT APPLE\nMAYBE HAS SOME MORE ROOM TO RUN.

AZURE, SO FAR BEHIND.\n>> BUT -- >> IRRELEVANT.\n>> I KNOW IT IS, BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE\nTO COMPETE WITH AMAZON. I WOULD RATHER OWN APPLE THAN\nMICROSOFT. >> LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.\nBASICALLY, EXCEPT IN YOUR SHORT-TERM SCENARIO, EVERYBODY\nWOULD RATHER OWN THE OTHER CHOICE OVER APPLE.\n>> UH -- WELL, MAYBE NOT -- I FIND MYSELF IN THE UNUSUAL\nSITUATION OF AGREEING WITH EVERYTHING DAN JUST SAID\nREGARDING MICROSOFT VERSUS APPLE.\nBUT YEAH, GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK -- I WOULD RATHER OWN THEM AND I DO\nRATHER OWN THEM. >> YOU DO.\n>> I DO. >> I JUST THINK IF YOU -- FIRST\nOF ALL, HOW CAN WE SIT HERE AND SAY WE LOVE APPLE WHEN THREE\nWEEKS AGO, WHEN APPLE WAS TRADING AT 98, 95, 98 BUCKS, WE\nWERE, YOU KNOW, NOT ALL THAT BULLISH.\nI THINK WE WERE POINTING OUT HEADWINDS.\nI WASN'T RUNNING FOR COVER ON THE STOCK.\nI ACTUALLY FELT LIKE THERE WAS OPPORTUNITIES AND AS WE GET INTO\nTHIS REFRESH CYCLE, PLACES FOR IT TO OUTPERFORM.\nI THINK IT'S DISINGENUOUS TO SAY LET'S BUY APPLE NOW, ESPECIALLY\nAFTER IT'S GONE FROM -- TO 114. >> WE'RE GOING TO SAY -- iPHONE\n7 WAS GOING TO BE A TERRIBLE PHONE WITH NO INNOVATION, AND\nHERE WE ARE SAYING IT'S BETTER THAN EXPECTED.\n>> DAN SAID THAT. >> AND SHOWS THAT APPLE CAN, IN\nFACT, INNOVATE. >> HERE'S THE THING.\nAND I THINK THIS IS A CONSENSUS AMONG EVEN THE MOST PESSIMISTIC\nPEOPLE. WHAT THEY HAVE IN THAT PHONE IS\nOBVIOUSLY -- THE BEST SMARTPHONE ON THE MARKET RIGHT NOW.\nIT'S JUST NOT THAT EXCITING. THIS IS A COMPANY THAT'S MADE\nTHEIR BONES WITH INDUSTRIAL DESIGN.\nNOTHING HAS CHANGED, RIGHT? AND THEY'RE NOT CONVINCING US\nBASED ON A TRICKED OUT NEW CAMERA THAT THIS -- YOU HAVE TO\nGO OUT AND SPEND $750 TO UPGRADE.\nI'M TELLING YOU, WHAT HAPPENED THIS WEEK, THERE IS NO NEW NEWS.\nTHIS PHONE IS GOOD. AND PEOPLE EXPECTED IT TO BE\nGOOD. WHAT ABOUT THIS -- THE WATCH?\nTHAT WASN'T IT PARTICULARLY EN NOVATIVE, AND ANYTHING STICKILY\nINTERESTING. THE EAR BUDS, I KNOW THAT PEOPLE\nARE SAYING THIS IS -- >> IT'S NOT ABOUT THE WATCH.\nNEVER HAS BEEN. >> BUT, TIM, IT'S 70% OF THEIR\nSALES ARE COMING FROM ONE PRODUCT.\nWHICH IS WHAT HER CONCERN IS, A VALUE BUYER OF A COMPANY THAT\nTRADES, 12 TIMES EARNINGS.

YOU KNOW, WHY PUT IT FOR THE\nCONSUMER? WELL, THAT PLUG, THAT JACK TAKES\nUP A LOT OF SPACE IN THE PHONE, AND THERE'S A LOT OF MORE\nIMPORTANT THINGS WE CAN PROVIDE FOR THE CONSUMER THAN THAT JACK.\nWE CAN PROVIDE A LARGER BATTERY. THE STEREO SPEAKERS I MENTIONED,\nTHOSE WERE ALSO ENABLED BECAUSE THE JACK IS NOT THERE ANYMORE.\n>> MIKE, SOMEONE SAID THIS MORNING, IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE\nIT'S LED THE DOW TWO STRAIGHT DAYS.\nIT'S TRUE. >> WELL, FLIGHT TO SAFETY,\nMAYBE, I DON'T KNOW, IN A TOUGH MARKET.\nWHAT'S INTERESTING, ONE WEEK FROM TODAY IS THE FOURTH\nANNIVERSARY OF APPLE STOCK FIRST GETTING TO $100 ON A\nSPLIT-ADJUSTED BASIS.

DONALD TRUMP MUST WIN OHIO, AT\nTHE MOMENT, HE'S UP FIVE POINTS, 46% TO 41% FOR HILLARY CLINTON.\nTHE THIRD-PARTY CANDIDATES GETTING A COMBINED TEN.\nWHY IS THIS HAPPENING? HERE'S ONE REASON, IN OTHER\nBATTLEGROUND STATES HILLARY CLINTON HAS BENEFITED BY WINNING\nAMONG COLLEGE-EDUCATED VOTERS. IN OHIO,\nDONALD TRUMP HAS A LEAD AND HE'S TROUNCING HILLARY CLINTON AMONG\nWHITE CLASS WORKING VOTERS. HILLARY CLINTON IS LOSING THESE\nVOTERS. IT IS A PLUS FOR DONALD TRUMP.\nHILLARY CLINTON NEEDS A GENDER GAP AND NEEDS TO WIN IT UP BIG\nWITH WOMEN VOTERS BECAUSE THE REPUBLICAN USUALLY WINS AMONG\nMEN. ONLY A TWO-POINT ADVANTAGE FOR\nSECRETARY CLINTON IN THIS OHIO POLL WITH WOMEN.\nTHAT'S A PROBLEM FOR HER. LET'S MOVE SOUTH TO THE BIGGEST\nBATTLEGROUND IN TERMS OF ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES, 29,\nFLORIDA, AND THE NUMBERS LOOK SIMILAR.\nTHIS ONE'S A LITTLE BIT TIGHTER INSIDE THE MARGIN OF ERROR, 44%\n-- 37% FOR TRUMP, AND 44 FOR CLINTON.\nTHIS IS THE CLOSEST RACE BETWEEN SINCE 2012 BETWEEN OBAMA AND\nROMNEY. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THIS\nEDUCATION GAP WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER BATTLEGROUND STATES,\nNOT LIKE HERE IN FLORIDA. DONALD TRUMP WINNING AMONG WHITE\nCOLLEGE GRADUATES AND TROUNCING WHITE COLLEGE EDUCATED VOTERS.\nONE OTHER POINT, HILLARY CLINTON IS THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE\nTRYING TO SUCCEED A TWO-TERM DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT.\nIF THE PRESIDENT'S DISAPPROVAL RATING IS A MAJORITY AS IT IS IN\nOHIO AND FLORIDA -- THEY DON'T LIKE THE PRESIDENT SO MUCH.\nHE IS UNDER WATER IN POLITICS, IN OTHER STATES WE'VE\nSEEN THE PRESIDENT ABOVE 50%, SHE DOES BETTER SO THE OBAMA\nMATTERS, AS WELL. SO POLLS IN OHIO, HOW DO THEY\nEFFECT THE ELECTORAL MAP, IF THE ELECTION WERE TODAY, SECRETARY\nCLINTON WOULD WIN. DARK BLUE IS SOLID DEMOCRAT.\nSO IF DONALD TRUMP WON FLORIDA AND OHIO, BASED ON THOSE NEW\nPOLLS, THERE'S NEW POLL SHOWING HIM WINNING IN NEVADA, EVEN THAT\nWOULD NOT BE ENOUGH FOR DONALD TRUMP TO WIN THE UPON\nPRESIDENCY, HE HAS TO TURN ONE OF THOSE BLUE STATES RED.\nVIRGINIA, MICHIGAN, PENNSYLVANIA, WATCH IF\nWE SEE MORE STATE POLLING. LOOK FOR THOSE GENDER NUMBERS.\nLOOK FOR THOSE EDUCATION NUMBERS.\nDONALD TRUMP HAS MOMENTUM, NOT QUITE ENOUGH.\n>> JOHN KING, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT.\nI WANT TO BRING IN OUR CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST, GLORIA\nBORGER, AND SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST, DAVID GERGEN.\nAND MARK PRESIDENT -- MARK PRESTON.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYONE. HOW WORRIED, GLORIA, SHOULD\nHILLARY CLINTON BE ABOUT THESE BATTLEGROUND NUMBERS?\n>> WORRIED. AND I THINK THEY ARE WORRIED\nABOUT THEM. SHE HAD A BIG BOUNCE COMING OUT\nOF HER CONVENTION. IT'S CLEAR EVAPORATED MORE OR\nLESS, AND BATTLEGROUND STATES TEND TO RISE AND FALL TOGETHER\nAND SHE'S HAVING A LITTLE PROBLEM WITH THEM RIGHT NOW.\nI WAS LOOKING AT SOME OF THE INTERNALS IN THE POLL NUMBERS\nJOHN WAS TALKING ABOUT IN FLORIDA AND OHIO.\nWHAT STRUCK ME WAS HOW BEHIND SHE WAS COMPARED TO BARACK OBAMA\nIN 2012 WITH YOUNGER VOTERS. SHE'S 13 POINTS BEHIND WHERE HE\nWAS IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA. THAT'S A LOT.\n>> AND THAT HELPED HIM WIN. >> IT REALLY HELPED HIM WIN.\nSHE NEEDS TO GET BERNIE SANDERS OUT THERE ON THE TRAIL, HELPING\nHER WITH THOSE YOUNGER VOTERS. THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY\nIMPORTANT TO HER. >> ON THE DOUBLE.\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NATIONAL POLLS, MARK, AND CNN'S POLL\nSHOWING OHIO AND FLORIDA TRUMP LEADS, SHE'S LOST A LOT OF\nGROUND SINCE THE CONVENTION. DONALD TRUMP, HE CLEARLY HAS THE\nMOMENTUM NOW. >> WELL, YES AND NOW.\nHE HAS THE MOMENTUM WHERE HE HAS KIND OF STABILIZED WHERE HE IS\nAT. SHE HAS REALLY DROPPED.\n SHE WAS UP EIGHT COMING UP OUT OF THE CONVENTION NATIONALLY,\nAND THAT TRACKED WITH THE BATTLEGROUND STATES BUT WHAT\nWE'RE SEEING AND NOT ONLY IN OUR TWO POLLS, IN IOWA AND NEVADA,\nTHAT ARE NOT GOOD AT ALL FOR HILLARY CLINTON AT THIS POINT,\nIT'S ALL TRENDING RIGHT NOW, AND WHILE THERE'S 55 DAYS LEFT, AND\nCLEARLY WHAT WE SAW FROM JOHN RIGHT THERE, SHE WOULD WIN TODAY\nGIVEN THE ELECTORAL MAP, THE TREND IS NOT GOING HER WAY.\n>> ARE WE SEEING PEOPLE WHO YOU KNOW WERE MAYBE A LITTLE BIT\nADVERSE TO DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T SO SURE ABOUT HIM\nAND NOW HE'S SORT OF APPEARS TO HAVE STABILIZED WITH THIS NEW\nTEAM, THAT THESE ARE REPUBLICANS WHO ARE COMING ON BOARD SAYING\nOKAY MAYBE WE CAN -- >> I THINK WE'RE SEEING A\nNATURAL COMING TOGETHER OF A REPUBLICAN PARTY THAT HAS BEEN\nINCREDIBLY FRACTURED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE YEAR.\n>> DAVID, CLINTON HAS HAD A ROUGH FEW WEEKS SINCE TRUMP\nCHANGED HIS CAMPAIGN TEAM. HE'S BEEN POUNDING HER ON THE\nFOUNDATION, THE E-MAILS, LARGELY AVOIDING MAKING MAJOR MISTAKES\nAND SHE HAD THIS DEPLORABLES COMMENT AND THE PNEUMONIA\nEPISODE. WHAT DOES SHE NEED TO DO TO TURN\nTHIS AROUND? AND CAN SHE?\n>> WIN THE FIRST DEBATE. EVERYTHING IS GOING TO COME TO\nTHAT DEBATE. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME\nBACK-AND-FORTH'ING OVER THE NEXT 12 DAYS OR SO.\nTHAT FIRST DEBATE BECOMES ALL IMPORTANT.\nA COUPLE THINGS, DON. IN THE BACKGROUND HERE, IS THAT\nAS YOU SAY, HE'S RUNNING A MUCH MORE DISCIPLINED AND SMARTER\nCAMPAIGN, MORE INTERESTING EVENTS THAN WHAT HE'S HAD IN THE\nPAST, AND I THINK THAT HAS HELPED HIM.\nBUT ALSO, THIS -- BOTH CANDIDATES HAVE ALLOWED THIS\nCAMPAIGN TO DRIFT OVER AND CENTER ON THE QUESTION AMONG THE\nPOPULOUS, WHICH ONE DO YOU TRUST MORE?\nWHICH ONE DO YOU LIKE MORE AND THAT'S THE BASIS ON WHICH YOU'RE\nGOING TO VOTE. SHE COULD EASILY LOSE THAT\nQUESTION. WHAT SHE CAN WIN ON IS WHO IS\nGOING TO DO MORE FOR THE COUNTRY WHO HAS AN AGENDA FOR THE FUTURE\nBOTH HOME AND ABROAD THAT'S GOING TO MAKE\nYOU MORE SAFER AND PROSPEROUS. SHE HAS A BETTER CHANCE OF\nWINNING THAT ON THE SUBSTANCE THAN ON THE LIKABILITY\nSITUATION. >> DONALD TRUMP HAD A RALLY AND\nTALKED ABOUT CLINTON'S HEALTH. LISTEN TO THIS.\n>> DO YOU THINK THIS IS EASY? OH, YOU THINK THIS IS SO EASY?\nIN THIS BEAUTIFUL ROOM THAT'S 122 DEGREES?\nIT IS HOT AND IT'S ALWAYS HOT WHEN I PERFORM BECAUSE THE\nCROWDS ARE SO BIG. I DON'T KNOW, FOLKS.\nYOU THINK HILLARY WOULD BE ABLE TO STAND UP HERE FOR AN HOUR AND\nDO THIS? I DON'T KNOW.\nI DON'T KNOW. I DON'T THINK SO.\nI DON'T THINK SO. >> NOT A GOOD LOOK, GLORIA?\n>> NOT A GOOD LOOK. FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T THINK IT'S\nEVER A GREAT IDEA TO COMPLAIN TO THE VOTERS HOW TOUGH YOUR JOB\nIS WHEN YOU RUN FOR PRESIDENT, I THINK THAT'S WHAT HE WAS\nDOING. SAYING KIND OF LIKE I DON'T NEED\nTHIS, BUT IT'S 100 DEGREES AND THIS IS REALLY HARD ON ME.\n>> HE'S ACTUALLY SAID I DON'T",

LET'S MOVE SOUTH TO THE BIGGEST\nBATTLEGROUND IN TERMS OF ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES, 29,\nFLORIDA, AND THE NUMBERS LOOK SIMILAR.\nTHIS ONE'S A LITTLE BIT TIGHTER INSIDE THE MARGIN OF ERROR, 44%\nFOR TRUMP AND 47% FOR CLINTON. THIS IS THE CLOSEST RACE BETWEEN\nOBAMA AND ROMNEY AND IF YOU LOOK AT THIS EDUCATION GAP WE'VE SEEN\nIN OTHER BATTLEGROUND STATES, NOT LIKE HERE IN FLORIDA.\nDONALD TRUMP WINNING AMONG WHITE COLLEGE GRADUATES AND TROUNCING\nWHITE COLLEGE EDUCATED VOTERS. ONE OTHER POINT, HILLARY CLINTON\nIS THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE TRYING TO SUCCEED A TWO-TERM\nDEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT. IF THE PRESIDENT'S DISAPPROVAL\nRATING IS LIKE OHIO AND AUTHORIZE, HE'S UNDER WATER IN\nPOLITICS, IN OTHER STATES WE'VE SEEN THE PRESIDENT ABOVE 50%,\nSHE DOES BETTER SO THE OBAMA MATTERS, AS WELL.\nSO POLLS IN OHIO, HOW DO THEY EFFECT THE ELECTORAL MAP, IF THE\nELECTION WERE TODAY, SECRETARY CLINTON WOULD WIN.\nDARK BLUE IS SOLID DEMOCRAT. SO IF DONALD TRUMP WON FLORIDA\nAND OHIO, BASED ON THOSE NEW POLLS, THERE'S NEW POLL SHOWING\nHIM WINNING IN NEVADA, EVEN THAT WOULD NOT BE ENOUGH FOR DONALD\nTRUMP TO WIN THE UPON PRESIDENCY, HE HAS TO TURN ONE\nOF THOSE BLUE STATES RED. MICHIGAN, PENNSYLVANIA, WATCH IF\nB WE SEE MORE STATEPOLLING.\nLOOK FOR THOSE GENDER NUMBERS. DONALD TRUMP HAS MOMENTUM, NOT\nQUITE ENOUGH. >> JOHN KING, THANK YOU VERY\nMUCH FOR THAT. I WANT TO BRING IN OUR CHIEF\nPOLITICAL ANALYST, GLORIA BORGER, AND SENIOR POLITICAL\nANALYST, DAVID GERGIN. THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYONE.\nHOW WORRIED, GLORIA, SHOULD HILLARY CLINTON BE ABOUT THESE\nBATTLEGROUND NUMBERS? >> WORRIED.\nAND I THINK THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT THEM.\nSHE HAD A BIG BOUNCE COMING OUT OF HER CONVENTION.\nIT'S CLEAR EVAPORATED MORE OR LESS, AND BATTLEGROUND STATES\nTEND TO RISE AND FALL TOGETHER AND SHE'S HAVING A LITTLE\nPROBLEM WITH THEM RIGHT NOW. I WAS LOOKING AT SOME OF THE\nINTERNALS IN THE POLL NUMBERS JOHN WAS TALKING ABOUT IN\nFLORIDA AND OHIO. WHAT STRUCK ME WAS HOW BEHIND\nSHE WAS COMPARED TO BARACK OBAMA WITH YOUNGER VOTERS.\nSHE'S 13 POINTS BEHIND WHERE HE WAS IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA.\nTHAT'S A LOT. >> AND THAT HELPED HIM WIN.\n>> IT REALLY HELPED HIM WIN. SHE NEEDS TO GET BERNIE SANDERS\nOUT THERE ON THE TRAIL, HELPING HER WITH THOSE YOUNGER VOTERS.\n>> ON THE DOUBLE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NATIONAL\nPOLLS, MARK, AND CNN'S POLL SHOWING OHIO AND FLORIDA TRUMP\nLEADS, SHE'LOST A LOT OF GROUND. SHE'S KIND OF STABILIZED WHERE\nHE'S AT. SHE HAS REALLY DROPPED.\n>> SHE WAS UP EIGHT COMING UP OUT OF THE CONVENTION\nNATIONALLY, AND THAT TRACKED WITH THE BATTLEGROUND STATES BUT\nWHAT WE'RE SEEING AND NOT ONLY IN OUR TWO POLLS, IN IOWA AND\nNEVADA, THAT ARE NOT GOOD AT ALL FOR HILLARY CLINTON AT THIS\nPOINT, IT'S ALL TRENDING RIGHT NOW, AND WHILE THERE'S 55 DAYS\nLEFT, AND CLEARLY WHAT WE SAW FROM JOHN RIGHT THERE, SHE WOULD\nWIN TODAY GIVEN THE ELECTORAL MAP, THE TREND IS NOT GOING HER\nWAY. >> ARE WE SEEING PEOPLE WHO YOU\nKNOW WERE MAYBE A LITTLE BIT ADVERSE TO DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE\nTHEY WEREN'T SO SURE ABOUT HIM AND NOW HE'S SORT OF APPEARS TO\nHAVE STABILIZED WITH THIS NEW TEAM, THAT THESE ARE REPUBLICANS\nWHO ARE COMING ON BOARD SAYING OKAY MAYBE WE CAN --\n>> I THINK WE'RE SEEING A NATURAL COMING TOGETHER OF A\nREPUBLICAN PARTY THAT HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY FRACTURED THROUGHOUT\nTHE WHOLE YEAR. >> DAVID, CLINTON HAS HAD A\nROUGH FEW WEEKS SINCE TRUMP CHANGED HIS CAMPAIGN TEAM.\nHE'S BEEN POUNDING HER ON THE FOUNDATION, THE E-MAILS, LARGELY\nAVOIDING MAKING MAJOR MISTAKES AND SHE HAD THIS DEPLORABLES\nCOMMENT AND THE PNEUMONIA EPI\nEPISODE, WHAT AND CAN SHE DO TO TURN THIS AROUND?\n>> WIN THE FIRST DEBATE. EVERYTHING IS GOING TO COME TO\nTHAT DEBATE. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME BACK\nAND FORTHING OVER THE NEXT 12 DAYS OR SO.\nTHAT FIRST DEBATE BECOMES ALL IMPORTANT.\nIN THE BACKGROUND HERE, IS THAT AS YOU SAY, HE'S RUNNING A MUCH\nMORE DISCIPLINED AND SMARTER CAMPAIGN, MORE INTERESTING\nEVENTS THAN WHAT HE'S HAD IN THE PAST, AND I THINK THAT HAS\nHELPED HIM. BUT ALSO, THIS -- BOTH\nCANDIDATES HAVE ALLOWED THIS CAMPAIGN TO DRIFT OVER AND\nCENTER ON THE QUESTION AMONG THE POPULOUS, WHICH ONE DO YOU TRUST\nMORE? WHICH ONE DO YOU LIKE MORE AND\nTHAT'S THE BASIS ON WHICH YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE.\nSHE COULD EASILY LOSE THAT QUESTION.\nWHAT SHE CAN WIN ON IS WHO IS GOING TO DO MORE FOR THE COUNTRY\nAND WHO HAS AN AGENDA AT HOME",

I THINK MUCH CLOSER THAN WHAT\nSOME PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE.\nWHAT THEY HAVE SEEN IS TRUMP WILL HAVE A BAD WEEK.\nBUT THEN HIS NUMBERS WILL TAKE A DIP AND THEN THEY WILL RESTORE.\nREPUBLICANS ARE LOOKING FOR A REASON TO VOTE FOR THE\nREPUBLICAN. DEMOCRATS ARE LOOKING FOR A\nREASON TO VOTE FOR THE DEMOCRAT. AND THEN YOU HAVE GILL STEIN AND\nGARY JOHNSON WHERE YOU ARE SEEING SHROFFING OFF OF VOTES\nTOWARDS THEM.

I THINK THAT MOST AMERICANS\nTHOUGHT HE WAS IN THE NEWS, AND THEY PROBABLY SAID, WELL, WHAT\nIS ALEPPO? I DON'T KNOW, EITHER, AND THEY\nGOT TO RESEARCHING GARY JOHNEN AND THEY LIKED WHAT THEY SAY.\nTHAT COULD BE THE REASON FOR THE BOUNCE.\n>> THEY'RE MAKING THE CASE TO GET ON THE DEBATE STAGE.\nI ADMARCH THE FULL-PAGE AD, BUT A LOT OF WORDS.\nIS THERE A SIMPLER, CLEARER WAILING TO MAKE THEIR POINT THAN\nTAKE ON THE A FULL-PAGE AD? >> I THINK WHAT THEY SHOULD\nFOCUS ON IS THE FACT THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT THEM TO BE\nIN THESE DEBATES, A \"USA TODAY\" POLL RECENTLY SAID THAT 75% OF\nAMERICANS WANT TO SEE THIRD-PARTY CANDIDATES IF THEY\nGET ON THE BALLOT IN ENOUGH STATES.\nJOHNSON AND WELD ARE ON THE BALLOT IN ALL 50 STATES AND\nWASHINGTON, D.C., SO IT'S PRETTY LOUD AND CLEAR THAT AMERICA\nWANTS TOLE THEM IN THESE DEBATES.\n>> THAT WOULD INCLUDE GOVERNOR WELD, THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF\nMASSACHUSETTS THEY'RE BOTH VERY ARTICULATE GENTLEMEN IT'S GOOD\nFOR THE PERSON LOWER IN THE POLLS WHAT DO YOU THINK THE\nIMPACT WOULD BE? >> IT WOULD DEFINITELY MAKE THE\nDEBATES MORE INTERESTING. THEY WILL ALREADY BY TO GO UP\nAGAINST HILLARY CLINTON ON HER OWN, BUT TO SEE JOHNSON AND HIS\nPERSPECTIVE. PROBABLY MOST AMERICANS DON'T\nKNOW WHAT A LIBERTARIAN IS. I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE PREPARED\nRESPONSES FOR THAT. >> WHO WOULD BE HURT MORE?\nI WOULD THINK IT COULD POTENTIAL HURT HILLARY CLINTON MORE,\nTHOUGH I DO KNOW A LOT OF CLINTON-ITS MADE A BIG DEAL OF\nTHE FLUB, SO WHY WERE THEY SO OBSESSED ABOUT IT?\n>> THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. I THINK POLLS HAVE SHOWN SO FAR\nWHEN YOU LOOK AT A FOUR-WAY RACE INSTEAD OF TWO, CLINTON'S LEAD\nDOES SHRINK A LOT. I DON'T KNOW WHY THAT IS, BUT\nAPPARENTLY THE LIBERTARIANS ARE DRAWING MORE FROM\nHILLARY CLINTON. I'M NOT SURE WHY.\n>> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THESE POLLS THAT SHOW THINGS\nREVERSING, NOT ONLY NARROWING, BUT REVERSING COMPLETELY?\nIN KEY STATES LIKE OHIO AND FLORIDA, DOWN TO SINGLE DIGITS\nIN PENNSYLVANIA. WAY TOO EARLY, AND SMART FOLKS\nLIKE YOU REMIND ME THAT THINGS CHANGE A LOT, BUT THAT WASN'T\nSUPPOSED TO BE THE CASE. SUDDENLY IT IS.\n>> YEAH, I THINK A LOT OF IT WAS THIS GRADUAL END OF HER\nCONVENTION BOUNCE, BUT STILL THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE GOING\nAWAY ABOUT TWO OR THREE WEEK AGO.\nTHERE HAS BEEN MORE QUESTION BEING HER HEALTH, OF COURSE, I\nDON'T KNOW HOW BIG OF AN IMPACT THAT IS HAVING, BUT WE'LL\nCONTINUE TO SEE TRANSPARENCY QUESTIONS ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON,\nAND IT COMES BACK TO THAT VERY CLEAR HONEST AND TRUST WORTHY\nQUESTION WITH HER. AMERICANS HAVE A TOUGH TIME\nDEFENDING HER ON THE ISSUE. SHE HAS A TOUGH TIME EXPLAINING\nIT. >> THIS HEALTH ISSUE, DO YOU\nTHINK IT BECOMES A BIG ISSUE? A THE LO LOT OF THE TRUMP FOLKS\nWERE RELIEVED WE WERE LOOKING AT THIS, AND NO ONE IS TALKING\nABOUT TAX RETURNS. AND THEN HE GOES ON DR. OZ, SAYS\nHE'S LOOKING GOOD. PEOPLE WHO WATCH THE SHOW ARE\nSAYING THAT HE WAS SAYING, YEAH, I COULD AFFORD TO LOSE SOME\nWEIGHT, BUT I'M IN GREAT SHAPE. DR. OZ SEEMED TO BE AGREEING\nWITH THAT SENTIMENT. HOW MUCH CAN YOU LEARN APPEARING\nON A SHOW LIKE THAT? OR DOES THAT MATTER THIS IT\nREACHES A KEY AUDIENCE. >> IT DOESN'T SEEM TO AT LEAST\nSHOW MORE TRANSPARENCY THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS ON THIS\nISSUE. SHE HASN'T GONE ON TV AND\nDISCUSSED IN A WIDE-OPEN INTERVIEW HER HEALTH RECORDS\nLIKE DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO DO WHEN THE TAPE COMES OUT\nTOMORROW. AT THE SAME TIME I WONDER HOW\nBIG AN EFFECT IT WOULD HAVE ON THE ELECTION.\nI THINK BARK TO 2008 WITH JACK McCAIN HE LOST IN THE END, BUT I\nDON'T THINK IT WAS BECAUSE OF HIS HEALTH, BUT AT THE SAME TIME\nHIS HEALTH PROBLEMS WEREN'T AS CLEAR AS HILLARY CLINTON'S ARE\nIN THIS ELECTION WITH THE VIDEO OF HER FAINTING OR FALLING DOWN,\nTHIS PNEUMONIA, YOU KNOW, WE'LL SEE IF IT'S STILL AN ISSUE IN\nTHE NEXT MONTH OR SO, BUT AS OF RIGHT NOW IT'S HAVING AN EFFECT.\n>> SOME OF YOU SAYING IF YOU DO THE MEDIA'S BIDDING, WHETHER\nIT'S ON TAX RETURNS AS MITT ROMNEY FOUND OUT, OR MEDICAL\nRECORDS, IT DOESN'T REALLY MOVE THE NEEDLE FORM.\n>> YEAH, I MEAN AMERICANS ARE GENERALLY -- WHEN YOU ASK WHAT\nTHEIR BIGGEST PROBLEM IN THE COUNTRY IS, IT'S NOT THE HEALTH\nOF OUR CANDIDATES, WHAT ARE THEIR TAX RETURNS SAYING?\nTHEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT JOBS, ABOUT THE ECONOMY.\nTHEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THEIR WAGES ARE RISING AND LIVES ARE\nIMPROVING. I CAN SEE AN ARGUMENT THAT\nAMERICANS DON'T CARE TOO MUCH ABOUT THE HEALTH OF THESE\nCANDIDATES. >> AND THEY SHOULD BE CAREFUL IN\nTHE CLINTON CAMP, RIGHT? MAKING FUN OF DONALD TRUMP.\nI ALWAYS FEEL THAT COMES BACK TO BITE YOU.\nBECAUSE A LOT OF AMERICANS LIKE FAST FOOD.\n>> YOU DON'T WANT TO LOOK ELITIST.\nFAST FOOD IS FAST FOOD AND IT'S A HUGE INDUSTRY FOR A REASON.\nEVEN HILLARY CLINTON STOPPED A CHIPOTLE WHEN SHE WAS\nCAMPAIGNING A YEAR AND A HALF AGO OR WHENEVER IT WAS.\nIT'S CLEAR THAT AMERICANS LOVE FAST FOOD.\n>> YEAH, JASON, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS OBSESSION WITH FAST\nFOOD. JASON RUSSELL, I PROMISED YOU WE\nARE GOING TO BE GETTING NEWS OUT OF THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IN ABOUT\nFIVE MINUTES OR SO. IN FACT, I HAVE THE NEWS HERE,\nAND YOU DO NOT WANT TO LEAVE.

AND AN EASY WAY FOR YOU TO ASK\nTHAT IS, HEY, WHAT THEY SAY TRUE?\nIS WHAT THEY SAY TRUE? THAT'S HARD FOR US, BUT THAT'S\nTHE JOB. SO, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS\nCAMPAIGN AND BOTH CANDIDATES, WHAT HAVE BEEN THE FIVE THINGS\nTHAT SHOW REALLY GLARING ERRORS WHEN IT COMES TO HAVING A\nRELATIONSHIP WITH THE TRUTH? WE'VE GOT ANSWERS FOR YOU.\nJOINING US RIGHT NOW TO GEOVER WHAT THE CANDIDATES ARE SAYING\nAND WHAT'S TRUE? POLITIFACT EDITOR ANGIE.\nSO, YOU'VE GIVEN US YOUR TOP FIVE AND YOU COULD HAVE TOP 55,\nBUT LET'S DO 5 AND WE'LL START WITH DONALD TRUMP AND MEXICO.\nDONALD TRUMP SAYS THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT, THEY SEND THE BAD\nONES OVER. THAT'S WHAT HE SAYS.\nTHAT CLAIM, HOW DID YOU JUDGE IT?\n>> WE RATED THIS ONE PANTS ON FIRE.\nTHAT MEANS, INACCURATE AND RIDICULOUS.\nTHERE'S NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THIS.\nMOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME OVER FROM MEXICO ARE LOOKING FOR\nJOBS AND WORK. AND THAT'S WHY WE SAW ILLEGAL\nIMMIGRATION DROP PRECIPITOUSLY DURING THE RECESSION.\nSO, WE TALKED TO A LOT OF EXPERTS WHO STUDY THE BORDER AND\nMIGRATION PATTERNS AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND THEY SAID THIS IS A\nMYTH. SO, PANTS ON FIRE.\n>> ALSO IGNORES THE CONTEXT THAT MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE\nILLEGALLY OVERSTAY VISAS AFTER FLOWN TO THE COUNTRY.\nNOT ALL RUNNING ACROSS THIS BORDER THAT ALLEGEDLY NEEDS A\nWALL. SO, NOW, HILLARY CLINTON.\nFBI DIRECTOR COMEY CALLED HER COMMENTS ABOUT E-MAIL TRUTHFUL.\n>> COMEY WAS CAREFUL TO STEER AWAY FROM ANY ENDORSEMENT LIKE\nTHAT. HE SAID HER ACTIONS WERE\nCARELESS. SO, THIS ONE, NOT TRUE.\nWE RATED IT PANTS ON FIRE. >> NOW, THE CONFUSION WE GET\nINTO AND I'M SURE YOU DO, TOO. SHE DID SOMETHING ILLEGAL.\nIT WAS ILLEGAL. SHE BROKE THE LAW.\nHOW DO YOU HANDLE THAT CLAIM? >> YOU KNOW, SHE HAS NOT BEEN --\nTHE FBI DECLINED TO BRING ANY CASE AGAINST HER.\nSO, AS FAR AS THE LEGAL SYSTEM GOES, THAT'S NOT, THAT'S NOT\nRIGHT NOW. AND, YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOME\nOTHER SENSE THAT THE EXPERTS WE TALKED TO SAID THIS WAS BAD FOR\nARCHIVING PURPOSES. IT WAS BAD FOR TRANSPARENCY\nPURPOSES. BUT ILLEGAL, THE GOVERNMENT\nPROSECUTORS DIDN'T MAKE THAT CASE.\n>> ALL RIGHT, BACK TO DONALD TRUMP.\nTRUMP SAYS HE OPPOSED THE IRAQ WAR.\nAS YOU KNOW, THIS HAS BEEN A BIG ONE ON THIS SHOW.\nI OFFER PEOPLE A \"NEW DAY\" MUG WHICH IS A COVETED ITEM, IF THEY\nCAN SHOW US ANY PROOF THAT TRUMP WAS AGAINST THE WAR BEFORE IT\nACTUALLY WAS WELL UNDER WAY. HOW DO YOU RATE IT?\n>> WE RATED THIS FALSE. IT'S NOT ACCURATE.\nHE KEEPS SAYING IT. WE'VE BEEN FACT CHECKING THIS\nONE ALONG WITH ALL THE OTHER FACT CHECKERS FOR MONTHS.\nHE POINTS TO AN \"ESQUIRE\" ARTICLE THAT WAS PUBLISHED WELL\nAFTER THE WAR STARTED. SO, THIS ONE IS JUST WRONG, TOO.\n>> HE HAS THAT TRANSCRIPT THAT HIS SUPPORTERS REFER TO THAT\nDOES NOT HELP HIS CAUSE. SO, HILLARY CLINTON SAID SHE\nNEVER SENT OR RECEIVED CLASSIFIED INFO VIA E-MAIL.\nWHAT DO YOU HAVE? >> WE RATED THIS ONE FALSE.\nTHERE WAS CLASSIFIED INFORMATION IN HER E-MAIL AND SOME WAS\nMARKED. THE CLINTON TEAM WILL ARGUE IT\nWASN'T MARKED PROPERLY WITH HEADERS AND THAT IS FINE.\nBUT THERE WAS CLASSIFIED INFORMATION IN THE E-MAIL AND\nCOMEY'S REPORT SAID SHE SHOULD HAVE REALIZED THIS.\n>> OKAY. THEN TRUMP ON TAX RETURNS.\nDONALD TRUMP SAYS HIS FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES MORE THAN MAKE UP\nFOR LACK OF RELEASING TAX RETURNS.\nWHAT DO YOU SAY? >> TOTALLY FALSE.\nHE SAYS HE HAS ALL THIS DISCLOSURE.\nACTUALLY, THE TAX RETURNS ARE HUGE AREA WHERE WE DON'T HAVE\nANY TRANSPARENCY. THE TAX RETURNS WOULD SHOW WHICH\nOF HIS ASSETS PRODUCED INCOME. THEY WOULD SHOW SOME OF HIS\nFINANCIAL TIES. AND THEY WOULD SHOW HOW MUCH HE\nGIVES TO CHARITY. THAT'S BECOME AN ISSUE IN RECENT\nWEEKS. ABOUT THE TAX RETURNS ARE NOT\nRELEASED SO THERE ARE ALL THESE THINGS THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT\nDONALD TRUMP'S FINANCES THAT WE NORMALLY KNOW ABOUT THE MAJOR\nCANDIDATES. >> WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON HOW\nDIFFICULT THE CLIMATE IS RIGHT NOW?\nYOU HAVE CLINTON GIVES OUT 40 YEARS OF TAXES AND FRUMP WON'T\nGIVE OUT ANY BECAUSE HE'S UNDER PROOF OF AUDIT.\nHE COULD GO BACK 30 YEARS IN TAXES, IF HE WANTED.\nHIS OPPONENT WENT 40. YOU CAN'T GET THE INFORMATION\nUNLESS HE GIVES IT TO YOU. HOW HARD IS IT TO FACT CHECK?\n>> IT'S CHALLENGING, BUT THERE IS SOME THINGS WE KNOW ABOUT\nTRUMP'S FINANCIAL RECORDS. SOME THINGS WE KNOW ABOUT HIS\nBUSINESS BACKGROUND AND THAT SORT OF THING IS BEING REVEALED.\nI WOULD EXPECT DONALD TRUMP TO BE CHALLENGED ON THIS DURING THE\nDEBATES. THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES\nRELEASING THEIR TAX RETURNS. NOT THAT THEY ARE REQUIRED TO,\nBUT THEY ALWAYS DO. IT'S LIKE A CULTURAL NORM.\nSO, HE'S BREAKING WITH THIS. NOW, SOMETIMES THE CANDIDATES\nDECIDE TO DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY, THE CLIMATE CHANGES, BUT THIS IS\nA BIG THING. THIS IS SIGNIFICANT INFORMATION\nTHAT'S NOT AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC.\n>> YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK THIS SHOULD BE AN ISSUE, ABOUT\nTRUMP'S WIFE. BILL CLINTON WAS DIFFERENT, HE\nWAS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\nBUT SHE GIVES HER IMMIGRATION INFORMATION TO IMMIGRATION\nLAWYER AND HE PUTS OUT A LETTER VETTING IT AND THAT IS NOT\nHELPFUL TO US BECAUSE HE CAN ONLY JUDGE AS A LAWYER, NOT AS\nSOME INDEPENDENT BODY WHAT HE GAVE HER.\nTHIS HAS LITTLE TRICKY. >> WE ALWAYS WANT TO VERIFY\nINFORMATION AND WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT IT OURSELVES.\nOUR FACT-CHECKING REPORTS WE LIST ALL THE SOURCES AND IF THE\nINFORMATION IS ONLINE WE LINK TO IT.\nNOT JUST JOURNALISTS, BUT THE PUBLIC.\nTHEY DON'T WANT TO TAKE PEOPLE'S WORD FOR IT.\nTHEY WANT TO SEE THE EVIDENCE AND THE DOCUMENTATION FOR\nTHEMSELVES. >> NOW WE HAVE THIS ISSUE WITH\nTRUMP AND HIS BUSINESS DEALINGS NOT TO SUGGEST THAT THEY ARE\nBAD, BUT HE DOES SO MUCH INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS, WE\nSHOULD SHOW WHAT IT IS. THAT INFORMATION IS LARGELY\nUNDER HIS OWN CONTROL. AS IT BECOMES PUBLIC WE KNOW\nYOU'LL BE ON IT AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING YOU BACK ON\nTHE SHOW.

QUESTIONS ABOUT TRUMP AND\nCLINTON'S MEDICAL RECORDS POINT TO A BROADER CONCERN ABOUT A\nLACK OF TRANSPARENCY BY THE CAMPAIGNS AND THE CANDIDATES.\nLET'S DISCUSS THAT AND MORE WITH OUR POLITICAL ANALYST DAVID\nGREGORY, AUTHOR OF \"HOW'S YOUR FAITH\" AN IMPORTANT BOOK JUST\nOUT IN PAPERBACK RIGHT NOW. ALSO JOINING US, CAROL LEE,\nWHITE HOUSE REPORTER FOR THE \"WALL STREET JOURNAL.\"\nCNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR RYAN LIZZA, HE'S THE WASHINGTON KORNT\nFOR THE \"NEW YORKER\" MAGAZINE. DAVID, TALK A LITTLE ABOUT WHAT\nWE ANTICIPATED. EARLIER THIS MORNING, WEREN'T\nGOING TO GET MUCH DURING THE \"DR. OZ SHOW\" GETTING.\nLISTENING TO DR. GUPTA, NOT WHAT JOHN McCAIN DID WHEN HE LET\nMEDICAL CORRESPONDENTS INCLUDING DR. GUPTA SPEND HOURS WITH HIS\nRECORD AND TALKING TO PHYSICIANS?\n>> AN EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCE BECAUSE HE HAD CANCER, MELANOMA\nAND ALLOWED A THOROUGH REVIEW. SOMETHING SPECIFIC TO CANCER\nWHICH COULD END HIS LIFE AND THAT MADE SENSE.\nTHERE'S A BASIC FOUNDATION OF TRANSPARENCY REQUIRED OF ANY\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE THAT BOTH CANDIDATES OUGHT TO ADHERE TO.\nA REALITY SHOW NATURE, WHICH WE'VE COME TO EXPECT OF DONALD\nTRUMP, IN TERMS OF THESE KINDS OF SLOW REVEALS.\nI THINK SOME OF IT IS JUST SILLY.\nYOU KNOW, THERE SHOULD BE A THOROUGH SCRUBBING OF THIS KIND\nOF INFORMATION. THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW.\nIT IS ALSO TRUE OF HILLARY CLINTON, WHO SHOULD BE MORE\nTRANSPARENT ABOUT HER RECORDS, AND ABOUT LEVELING WITH HER\nPRESS CORPS IF SHE GETS DIAGNOSED WITH SOMETHING LIKE\nPNEUMONIA. >> YES.\nAND, CAROL, THE CAMPAIGN MANAGER FOR DONALD TRUMP, KELLYANNE\nCONWAY, SHE SAID THIS, I'M QUOTING.\nI DON'T KNOW WHY WE NEED SUCH EXTENSIVE MEDICAL REPORTING WHEN\nWE ALL HAVE A RIGHT TO PRIVACY. SO WHEN YOU HEAR THAT, WHEN I\nHEAR THAT, AS REPORTERS, AS JOURNALISTS WE SAY, IF YOU'RE\nRUNNING FOR PRESIDENT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THAT COMPLETE\nRIGHT TO PRIVACY. >> IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT\nSTANDARD. IF YOU'RE RETURNING FOR\nPRESIDENT YOU HAVE, YOU DON'T HAVE A RIGHT TO PRIVACY ON\nCERTAIN ISSUES. THERE ARE THINGS THAT\nTRADITIONALLY THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW.\nTHEY NEED TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR HEALTH.\nTHEY TRADITIONALLY KNOW ABOUT YOUR TAXES.\nAND WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THIS ELECTION CYCLE IS, AN EROSION OF\nTHESE LONGTIME NORMS ON BOTH SIDES.\nWHETHER HEALTH RECORDS OR TAXES OR PRESS ACCESS.\nAND IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT IF IT CONTINUES IN THIS WAY, THAT\nYOU'RE EVER GOING TO REALLY GET THAT BACK.\n>> BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW, RYAN, YOU WANT A RIGHT TO PRIVACY,\nDON'T RUN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\n>> I WAS LITERALLY GOING TO SAY THAT EXACT SAME THING.\n>> ALL OF US, PRIVATE CITIZENS HAVE A RIGHT TO PRIVACY.\nIF YOU WANT TO BE THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD, THE MOST\nIMPORTANT POSITION IN THE WORLD, THE AMERICAN PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT\nTO KNOW IF YOU'RE HEALTHY, NO THE HEALTHY, TAXES, ALL THAT.\n>> YOU VALUE PRIVACY, RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IS NOT THE\nBUSINESS TO BE IN. SHOULDN'T BE IN THE PUBLIC EYE\nAT ALL, SHOULDN'T HAVE YOUR OWN REALITY TV SHOW.\nI'M A LITTLE SURPRISED SHE SAID THAT.\nI THINK AT THE MINIMUM, TRUMP NEEDS TO MATCH WHAT CLINTON HAS\nREVEALED. SHE PUT OUT A TWO-PAGE LETTER\nLAST YEAR. NOT THE MOST THOROUGH DOCUMENT\nIN THE WORLD, BUT IT HAD ALL OF THE MEDICATIONS SHE'S TAKING.\n2 HAD THE HISTORY OF HER BLOOD CLOT AND HER CONCUSSION AND\nSEASONAL ALLERGIES AND GAVE US --\n>> HISTORY OF DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS IN HER LEGS.\n>> YES. EXACTLY.\nAND THE MOST RECENT PHYSICAL. TRUMP HASN'T DONE SOME SIMILAR.\nWE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED ON DR. OZ TODAY.\nSOUNDS A LITTLE MORE FROM THE REPORT LIKE A REALITY TV\nPUBLICITY STUNT THAN A SERIOUS MEDICAL EVALUATION WITH LOTS OF\nDETAILED INFORMATION. WE'LL HAVE TO SEE.\n>> THE POINT IS, YOU WANT DATA. RIGHT?\nYOU WANT TO HAVE -- CNN WOULD LIKE THIS INFORMATION.\nHAVE DR. GUPTA TO SAY WHAT DOES IT TELL YOU ABOUT RISK FACTORS\nAND OTHER THINGS ABOUT HISTORY THAT WOULD BE RELEVANT WHETHER\nHE COULD SERVE CAPABLY AT PRESIDENT.\n>> THIS PAIR IS THE OLDEST PAIR OF PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES --\n>> HE'S 70, NEXT MONTH SHE'LL BE 69.\n>> RIGHT. THIS ISN'T LIKE, A COUPLE OF\nSPRING CHICKENS. >> NO.\nONE OF THE OTHER THINGS -- >> MAKES THIS MUCH MORE\nIMPORTANT. >> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S\nCONCERNING, YOU TALKED ABOUT. CLINTON RELEASED LAST YEAR AND\nTRUMP WILL MATCH THAT. A RACE TO THE BOTTOM, I'LL DO\nTHE MINIMUM, I'LL DO THE MINIMUM.\nTRADITIONALLY IT'S INFORMATION THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN GIVEN TO THE\nPUBLIC. >> HOW MUCH DAMP AGE WAS DONE T\nHER IN THE DELAY OF RELEASING THE NEWS SHE HAD PNEUMONIA?\n>> A PROBLEM. MUCH MORE DEFINING THAN THE\nBASKET OF DEPLORABLES COMMENT. THIS IS THE FUNDAMENTAL\nCRITICISM OF HER. A PENCHANT FOR SECRECY, MAYBE\nDECEPTION SHE'S TOO SECRETIVE ABOUT.\nSHE REINFORCES IT TIME AFTER TIME.\nTHERE'S NO REASON FOR IT. SHE SAYS COMPARE ME TO MY\nALTERNATIVE. THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT\nALTERNATIVE. DONALD TRUMP NOT RELEASING TAXES\nIS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE, BUT THE COMPARISON IS IS REASONABLE,\nPRECEDENT, HISTORIC. THEY SHOULD BOTH BE HELD TO\nTHIS. I AGREE WITH YOU, CAROL.\nMEMBERS OF THE PRESS. WE WANT ULTIMATE ACCESS.\nTHE PUBLIC SHOULD GET AS MUCH ACCESS AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE\nKNOWLEDGE IS IMPORTANT HERE. >> CAROL, WHEN WE GET THE\nCRITICISM, AS WE DO WHEN WE PRESS FOR THESE DETAILS AND WANT\nIF RIGHT AWAY, HER SUPPORTERS COME, SAY, BIG ISSUES OUT THERE.\nWHY AREN'T YOU FOCUSING ON ON THOSE?\nWHY FOCUS ON THE FEW HOURS, DELAY IN THE RELEASE OF THE WORD\n\"PNEUMONIA\"? >> THESE THINGS MATTER TOP WHAT\nYOU'RE SAYING ABOUT HER, THE PERCEPTION ARE HERE ADHERING TO\nSECRECY AND ON DONALD TRUMP SIDE YOU SEE POLLS ARE SHOWING VOTERS\nDO CARE ABOUT RELEASING YOUR TAX RETURNS.\nI THINK WHAT'S GOING TO MATTER IS WHETHER THE CANDIDATES PAY AT\nTHE POLLS FOR THE APPROACH THEY'VE TAKEN, AND THAT'S NOT\nCLEAR THEY WILL. >> THE POLLS COMING--\n>> OVERWHELMING. >> SHOW DONALD TRUMP REALLY\nCATCHING UP PRETTY DRAMATICALLY. THERE'S A NEW BLOOMBERG POLL\nTHAT JUST CAME OUT IN OHIO. THE KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE OF\nOHIO. LOOK AT THIS.\nTRUMP AT 44%. CLINTON, 39%.\nFIVE-POINT LEAD AND THEN YOU GET INTO GARY JOHNSON, THE\nLIBERTARIAN CANDIDATE, AND JILL STEIN.\nTHIS IS -- IN OHIO, AND THEN A MONMOUTH UNIVERSITY POLL IN\nNEVADA RIGHT NOW. TRUMP IS WINNING THERE 44% TO\n42%. THESE ARE NUMBERS THAT CLEARLY\nARE DISTURBING TO THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN.\n>> YEAH. LOOK, THESE BATTLEGROUNDS LIKE\nIOWA, NEVADA AND OHIO, DEMOGRAPHICALLY A LITTLE BETTER\nFOR TRUMP TIGHTENED QUITE A BIT. THE OVERALL PICTURE, NINE-POINT\nLEAD FOR CLINTON DOWN TO A 4.5 LEAD, DEPENDING ON THE POLL YOU\nLOOK AT. THAT'S CONCERNING.\nHE'S DOING SOMETHING RIGHT OVER THIS LAST MONTH.\nMAYBE IT'S THE TRADITIONAL POSTCONVENTION BOUNCE\nDISSIPATING AND THIS RACE IS SETTLING INTO A SLIM BUT\nCOMFORTABLE LEAD FOR HILLARY, BUT THEY NEED TO BE A LITTLE BIT\nWORRIED BY THE, NOT JUST THE NATIONAL POLLS NOW BUT NOW THESE\nIMPORTANT SWING STATES, YOU AND I, WE'VE ALL COVERED -- NATIONAL\nPOLLS ARE IMPORTANT. INTERESTING.\nTHE KEY BATTLEGROUND STATES, OHIO, FLORIDA, SOME OF THESE\nOTHER KEY BATTLEGROUNDS STATES, WHETHER VIRGINIA, NORTH\nCAROLINA, PENNSYLVANIA. THAT'S WHERE THIS BATTLE IS\nGOING TO BE WON AND LOST. >> PARTICULARLY IF YOU LOOK, HIS\nBREAD AND BUTTER, MALE VOTERS. VOTERS, WHITE VOTERS WITHOUT A\nCOLLEGE DEGREE. HE'S, HE HAS A HUGE ADVANTAGE\nOVER HILLARY CLINTON AMONG THOSE VOTERS WHO ARE GOING TO BE IN\nSTATES LIKE OHIO.

YOU'VE SEEN BILL CLINTON THERE,\nJOE BLIDEN. >> THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES IN PENNSYLVANIA, OF ALL PLACES, SHOULD BE A RELATIVELY\nEASY LOCK FOR THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE BUT THEY CONSIDER IT\nPROBLEMATIC RIGHT NOW.

UBER IS LAUNCHING A PRIORITY\nPRAMT OF SELF-DRIVING PROGRAMS IN THAT CITY AND PHIL LeBEAU\nTRIED IT OUT. >> THIS IS REALLY THE\nBEGINNING -- NOT REALLY EVEN THE BEGINNING, IT'S THE LATEST IN\nTHE RACE BETWEEN A NUMBER OF COMPANIES, INCLUDING UBER, WHEN\nIT COMES TO TURNING RIDE-SHARING INTO AUTONOMOUS DRIVE RIDE\nSHARING. LOOK AT ALL THE COMPANIES THAT\nARE NOW PUTTING IN EFFORTS, PUTTING IN PROGRAMS THAT ARE\nFOCUSED ON TAKING RIDE-SHARE OPERATIONS AND WORKING TOWARDS\nSTRIPPING OUT THE DRIVER. YOU'VE GOT UBER, WE'LL TALK\nABOUT THAT. THE CHINESE COMPANY WORKING WITH\nINVIDIA, GM AND LYFT AND THEN FORD BY 2021.\nBY THE WAY, THAT'S ME, TAKING MY HANDS OFF THE WHEEL OF THE UBER\nVEHICLE IN PITTSBURGH. WHAT IS UBER DOING IN STEEL\nTOWN? THEY'VE GOT A HANDFUL OF FORD\nFUSIONS WITH 20 CAMERAS AND LASERS ON THEM.\nTHEY'VE OUTFITTED THEM, DIVING RIDES TO PEOPLE FOR FREE WHO\nSAY, SURE, I'LL TAKE A SELF-DRIVING VEHICLE.\nKEEP IN MIND, THIS IS A PILOT PROGRAM, A LITTLE EARLY TO\nEXPECT THEM TO EXPAND IT NATIONWIDE.\n>> I JUST TOOK AN UBER AND THEY WERE ASKING ME IF I WOULD TAKE\nONE. AND I SAID NO.\n>> I WOULD GIVE IT A SHOT. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?\nIT WOULD BE INTERESTING. >> I WOULD LIKE TO BE IN CHARGE\nOF A VEHICLE THAT I'M IN, IF I'M DRIVING IT OR IF I'M A\nPASSENGER. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE\nPERSON WHO IS DRIVING IT IS PAYING ATTENTION TO THE ROAD.\n>> OVERALL, THE REACTIONS WERE SPLIT IN TERMS OF HOW PEOPLE\nWOULD FEEL ABOUT GETTING INTO A DRIVERLESS UBER.\nBUT AGAIN, KELLY, THERE WILL BE AN UBER ENGINEER IN THE FRONT\nSEAT, ALONG WITH A TEST DRIVER AT LEAST FOR THE FIRST SEVERAL\nMONTHS AND EVENTUALLY MAY GO DOWN TO ONE UBER EMPLOYEE IN THE\nFRONT SEAT. WE'RE A LONG WAY FROM SEEING A\nCAR PULL UP AND THERE IS NOBODY IN IT AND YOU GET IN AND THAT'S\nYOUR UBER RIDE. SOME DAY WE MAY BE THERE, BUT\nTHAT'S NOT COMING ANY TIME SOON. >> THAT'S THE FUNNY PART OF\nTHIS, KAYLA. FOR RIGHT NOW, THERE'S ACTUALLY\nMORE PEOPLE IN THE UBER CAR AND NOT LESS, WHICH IS THEIR\nLONG-TERM GOAL. >> I THINK YOU WOULD RATHER HAVE\nTHAT. WE SEE CARS BEING TESTED IN BIG\nOPEN PARKING LOTS WHERE NO ONE CAN GET HURT.\nPITTSBURGH IS SO CHALLENGING. WE ASKED THE MAYOR ON \"SQUAWK\nALLEY.\" HE SAYS IT'S HILLY, THEY ARE\nFOUR SEASONS AND IT'S WIND ERODES LAID OUT IN THE 1900s.\nBUT I WOULDN'T THINK THAT WOULD BE THE PERFECT TERRAIN TO BE\nTESTING SOMETHING LIKE THIS. >> AND KELLY, WHILE WE WERE IN\nTHE CAR, WE SAW TWO TRUCKS CUT US OFF AND THE CAR HAD TO REACT\nQUICKLY, AND IT DID REACT QUICKLY.\nIT'S CALLED A PITTSBURGH LEFT. APPARENTLY, THIS IS THE WAY THEY\nDO IT IN PITTSBURGH. YOU DON'T WAIT DURING THE GREEN\nLIGHT TO TURN LEFT FOR THE ONCOMING TRAFFIC LIKE WE DO IN\nMOST CITIES. NOPE, YOU WANT TO GO, YOU GO.\nTHEY CALL IT THE PITTSBURGH LEFT AND IT'S CREATED CHALLENGES FOR\nUBER IN THAT CITY. I EXPERIENCED IT FIRSTHAND, BOTH\nTIMES. THE CAR STOPPED AHEAD OF THE\nVEHICLE TURNING IN FRONT OF US. SO THEY'RE GETTING SOME\nCHALLENGING ROUTES, NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.\n>> I HAD A LITTLE EXPERIENCE IN ONE OF THE SELF-DRIVING CARS\nTHERE. IT WAS A LITTLE SCARY.\nBUT IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT SYSTEM.\nAND IT WAS ONE THAT ACTUALLY WAS TALKING DIRECTLY TO THE TRAFFIC\nLIGHTS, AND THINGS LIKE THAT ON A PREDETERMINED ROUTE.\nTHIS IS VERY DIFFERENT, MIKE. AND IT'S JUST INTERESTING WHAT\nYOU WERE SAYING. A MOMENT AGO.\nABOUT THE SNOW. I REMEMBER ACTUALLY THE SNOW AND\nTHOSE KINDS OF CONDITIONS BEING A HUGE ENGINEERING CHALLENGE.\n>> IN SOME RESPECTS, MAYBE THAT'S THE PERFECT PLACE TO TEST\nIT OUT. YOU DON'T NECESSARILY WANT IT TO\nBE ARTIFICIALLY EASY FOR THESE CARS.\nI JUST FIND IT INTERESTING FROM A CORPORATE PERSPECTIVE IF THIS\nINDEED IS THE FUTURE. UBER HAS BEEN SO ORIENTED\nENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO DRIVE FOR IT.\nMAYBE NOW THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE THIS PHASE OF THE BUSINESS LIKE,\nYOU KNOW, DVDs IN THE MAIL WAS TO NETFLIX.\nIT WAS JUST THIS KIND OF WAY TO GET YOU IN THE HABIT OF USING A\nPRODUCT THIS WAY. >> I WAS GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE\nAIR BUDS AND AIR PODS AGAIN. NEVER MIND.\nPHIL, THANK YOU SO MUCH. CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HOW THIS PLAYS\nOUT.",

ONLY ACCEPT CONTRIBUTIONS FROM\nU.S. CITIZENS INDEPENDENT CHARITIES.\nNOT ACCEPT CONTRIBUTIONS FROM FOREIGN INDIVIDUALS,\nGOVERNMENTS, CORPORATIONS OR CHARITIES.\nFORMER PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON WOULD RESIGN FROM THE BOARD OF\nDIRECTORS THE FOUNDATION'S INTERNATIONAL WORK WOULD\nTRANSITION TO OTHER ORGANIZATIONS.\nSO I MEAN I GUESS THAT BEGS THE QUESTION IF THIS IS IMPORTANT IF\nSHE'S ELECTED PRESIDENT, WHY WEREN'T THESE CHANGES NECESSARY\nWHEN SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE? >> WELL, IT WAS A DIFFERENT\nSITUATION.

THE QUESTION BECOMES WHAT SHOULD\nWE ASSUME ABOUT WHAT TRUMP WON'T TELL US.\nNOW, WE KNOW HOW THE PRESS GENERALLY TREATS HILLARY CLINTON\nIN THIS REGARD. ANYTHING THAT IS PRIVATE IS\nASSUMED TO BE ME THAT AREHOUSE OR EMBARRASSING.\nIF IT'S NOT DISCLOSED, IT MUST BE CORRUPT OR CRIMINAL.\nTHIS IS TRUE EVEN WHEN SHE JUST GOT SICK AND TRIED TO POWER\nTHROUGH. NO MATTER HOW MUCH SHE REVEALED,\nSHE RARELY GETS THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT.\nWHEN IT COMES TO TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS WHICH ARE THE SINGLE SET\nOF DOCUMENTS THAT COULD REVEAL THE ACTUAL BUSINESS RECORD OF A\nMAN WHO IS ONLY CAREER HAS BEEN BUSINESS, A DOCUMENT THAT WOULD\nSHOW PERFORMANCE AND POTENTIAL CONFLICTS HE WOULD FACE AS\nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, CONFLICTS THAT COULD QUITE\nCLEARLY POSE A FUNDAMENTAL THREAT TO THE INTEREST OF THE\nNATION, DONALD TRUMP WANTS THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT.\nHE EXPECTS IT AND FOR THE MOST PART, SOMEHOW, HE'S GOTTEN IT.\nTODAY WE HAD A WINDOW INTO HOW MUCH IS AT STAKE IF DONALD TRUMP\nBECOMES PRESIDENT. JOURNALIST COURT ICAHN EXPLORES\nHOW THE BUSINESS TIES TO CRIMINALS COULD UP END U.S.\nSECURITY. WRITING IF TRUMP MOVES INTO THE\nWHITE HOUSE AND FAMILY CONTINUES TO RECEIVE ANY BENEFIT FROM THE\nCOMPANY DURING AND AFTER PRESIDENCY, ALMOST EVERY FOREIGN\nPOLICY DECISION HE MAKES WILL RAISE SERIOUS CONFLICTS OF\nINTEREST AND ETHICAL KWAG MIRES. >> CURT, THE PIECE GOES THROUGH,\nI WANT TO FIRST SORT OF SKETCH OUT THE HIGHEST LEVEL.\nTHE BASIC THRUST OF THE PIECE WHICH ARE ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S\nBUSINESS DEALINGS OVERSEAS AND WHAT KIND OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS\nTHEY WOULD RAISE FOR A DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENCY.\n>> OKAY. WELL, THE PRIMARY THING HERE IS\nYOU'VE GOT TRUMP HAS ABOUT 500 DIFFERENT PARTNERSHIPS, ENTITIES\nTHAT ARE SUBSIDIARIES OF THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION.\nMANY OF THOSE HAVE PARTNERS THAT ARE OVERSEAS OR DOMESTIC.\nI FOCUSED ON THE OVERSEAS ONES. EVERY TIME I WAS ABLE TO TRACK\nONE DOWN, EVERY TIME I WAS ABLE TO LOOK AT THEM, THESE WERE\nPEOPLE WHO WERE TIED TO GOVERNMENTS, VERY CLOSELY, MUCH\nMORE SO THAN YOU WOULD FIND IN THE UNITED STATES.\nTHEY WERE INVOLVED IN ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES, THEIR INTERESTS WERE\nNOT ALIGNED WITH THE INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\nSO YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO HAVE TO\nCHOOSE. HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO CHOOSE A\nPARTNER WHO WAS GIVING HIM MONEY, WHO WAS GIVING HIS KIDS\nMONEY, OR THE INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES.\nAND THERE HAS NEVER, EVER IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICA BEEN A\nSCENARIO LIKE THAT. >> I WANT TO FOCUS ON THAT.\nJUST HOW UNPRECEDENTED THIS IS. I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT\nHAPPENED WITH DONALD TRUMP WE BECAME SO USED TO HIS PRESENCE\nAT A POLITICAL FIGURE. HE WON THE PRIMARY.\nWHEN WE THINK ABOUT WELL, HE WON'T RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS.\nIF HE IS ELECTED HE WILL TAKE THE OATH OF OFFICE JANUARY 20\nAND THERE IS NO PRECEDENT OR GROUND RULES FOR HOW SOMEONE\nWITH EXTENSIVE AND PRIVATE BUSINESS DEALINGS WOULD CONDUCT\nTHOSE BUSINESS DEALINGS WHILE BEING THE PRESIDENT OF THE\nUNITED STATES WHEN THOSE BUSINESS DEALINGS MAY AT EVERY\nTURN, WHETHER IT'S A RUSSIAN DEVELOPMENT DEAL OR SOMETHING IN\nDUBAI PRESENT SOME CONFLICT TO THE THE INTEREST OF THE UNITED\nSTATES. >> YES, IT'S NEVER HAPPENED.\nONE OF THE DEALINGS I TALK ABOUT IS ONE THAT THEY STRUCK AND IT'S\nA DEAL WITH THEIR PARTNER THERE IS THE SON OF A MAJOR GOVERNMENT\nFIGURE, A MINISTER IN THE GOVERNMENT WHO AMERICAN\nINTELLIGENCE HAS IDENTIFIED AS A MAN WHO IS LAUNDERING MONEY FOR\nTHE IRANIAN MILITARY. THAT IS THE FATHER OF DONALD\nTRUMP'S BUSINESS PARTNER. SO IS DONALD TRUMP GOING TO LEAN\nON HIS PARTNER? IS HE GOING TO LEAN ON\nINTELLIGENCE? IS HE GOING TO LEAN ON IT WILL\nGOVERNMENT? WHAT CHOICE IS HE GOING TO MAKE\nOR IS HE SIMPLY GOING TO SAY, I'M NOT GOING TO WORRY ABOUT\nTHIS. LET THE MONEY FLOW IN.\nAGAIN, THE STORY I GO THROUGH IN DETAIL, A NUMBER OF THEM, BUT\nALL TOLD I LOOK AT 15 DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND ALL OF THEM ARE 15\nDIFFERENT PARTNERSHIPS AND ALL OF THEM HAVE THESE KIND OF\nCONFLICTS. >> THERE IS ALSO THE FACT THAT\nAS YOU TALK, THERE'S ALL THESE SUBSIDIARIES.\nA LOT OF THIS IS YOU'RE WORKING OFF THE FAIRLY SPARSE FILINGS\nTHAT WE HAVE FROM HIM THAT ARE THE FEC FILINGS.\nAM I CORRECT ABOUT THAT? >> THAT'S ONE ELEMENT.\nTHE MAJOR THING I HAD TO DO WAS TRACK DOWN PEOPLE OVERSEAS WHO\nKNEW THINGS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. WHO HAD WORKED WITH DONALD\nTRUMP. WHO HAD WORKED WITH HIS\nORGANIZATION. >> SO YOU DON'T HAVE A BLUEPRINT\nFOR ALL THIS STUFF. YOU HAVE TO GO AND START CALLING\nAROUND TURKEY TO FIND OUT WHO THE MAJOR PEOPLE ARE INVOLVED\nWITH THE DEAL IN THIS REGARD. >> YES AND ACTUALLY THE STORY\nSAYS WHICH I FIND SORT OF BIZARRE, BUT I DID SAY IT THAT\nONE OF THE MAIN SOURCES WHO HOOKED ME UP WITH PEOPLE IN\nTURKEY WAS AN ARAB FINANCER. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE CROSSING OVER\nDIFFERENT AREAS IN ORDER TO GET THE INFORMATION, BUT, YOU KNOW,\nPEOPLE IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD ARE TERRIFIED.\nAND, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE ELEMENTS HERE THAT I FIND THE\nMOST OUTRAGEOUS AND I THINK YOU REALLY TOUCHED ON IN THE OPENING\nHERE, YOU KNOW, I WAS ALONE. THIS IS THE LOW HANGING FRUIT.\nWHAT IS DONALD TRUMP'S BUSINESS? WHAT IS THIS PRIVATE\nCORPORATION? YOU KNOW, THE PRESS IS WAITING\nFOR DONALD TRUMP TO REVEAL INFORMATION TO THEM AND HE'LL\nSAY, I'M GOING HAVE RECORDS THIS WEEK.\nOH, NO I'M NOT. I'LL RELEASE IT HERE.\nNO I'M NOT. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LEARN, HE'S\nNOT GOING TO RELEASE ANYTHING. UNTIL WE START DIGGING IN, LIKE\nI HAD TO WITH THIS STORY ON THIS COMPANY, WE'RE NOT GOING TO KNOW\nWHO THIS MAN IS, EVEN WHEN HE WALKS INTO THE OVAL OFFICE, IF\nIT GETS THERE. >> IT'S UNPRECEDENTED AT THE\nPRESIDENTIAL LEVEL, BUT NOT UNPRECEDENTED AT OTHER LEVELS.\nDICK CHANY, CEO OF HALIBURTON, MICHAEL BLOOMBERG IN NEW YORK\nCITY. IN THOSE CASES YOU HAVE SELLING\nSTAKES, BLIND TRUST, SOME SORT OF ARM'S LENGTH ARRANGEMENT SO\nMUCH THE ENTERPRISE IN QUESTION COULD BE FIRED OFF.\nTRUMP SAYS HE'LL GIVE IT TO HIS KIDS.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT AS A POSSIBLE ETHICAL SOLUTION TO\nTHIS INCREDIBLE LIST OF POSSIBLE CONFLICTS?\n>> IT'S ABSURD. DONALD TRUMP IS A SMART GUY IN\nBUSINESS. HE KNOWS WHAT A BLIND TRUST IS.\nHE IS SAYING I'LL PUT THE COMPANY IN A BLIND TRUST.\nA BLIND TRUST IS WHEN YOU TAKE A SERIES OF INVESTMENTS, A\nPORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS, TURN THEM OVER TO AN INDEPENDENT\nPERSON WHO THEN DOES THE TRADE FG R YOU.\nYOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THEM. IF I SAID I AM STICKING TO TRUMP\nORGANIZATION INTO A BLIND TRUST, WELL, THAT WOULD BE THE MOST\nTRANSPARENT THING IN DONALD TRUMP'S LIFE IS THAT BLIND\nTRUST. WE KNOW WHAT'S IN IT, IT'S THE\nTRUMP ORGANIZATION. PLUS IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE\nSOMEBODY INDEPENDENT. HE'S SAYING I'LL LET MY KIDS\nMANAGER IT. >> IT WILL BE THE FAMILY\nBUSINESS. >> EXACTLY.\nAND IVANKA TRUMP WENT ON ANOTHER NETWORK AND SAID WE'LL TAKE CARE\nOF THE PROBLEM. WE'RE A PRIVATE COMPANY.\nWE'LL CHOOSE THE DEALS TO AVOID THESE KINDS OF ISSUES.\nWHICH IS RIDICULOUS. NOW SAYING DONALD TRUMP'S FAMILY\nIS GOING TO DECIDE WHICH ISSUES CAN RAISE NATIONAL SECURITY\nQUESTION. >> WITH NO TRANSPARENCY INTO\nTHEM. >> AS FAR AS WE KNOW, NO\nDISCLOSURE. >> UNLESS DONALD TRUMP STARTS\nCALLING HER UP AND SHARING, YOU KNOW, CLASSIFYING INTELLIGENCE\nTO LET HER KNOW WHICH ONES NOT TO DO BUSINESS WITH, IT'S ABSURD\nAND WE WON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.\n>> CURT, REALLY AMAZING PETE OF RURTING IN THE NEWS WEEK.COM.\nJUST SORT OF THE TIP OF THE ICE BURG WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE\nUNPRECEDENTED UNIVERSE THAT WE'RE ENTERING INTO.\nI REALLY APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU.\n>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME. >>> STILL TO COME, LATEST\nPOLLING SHOWS A TIGHTENING RACE. DEMOCRATS ARE FREAKING OUT A\nLITTLE. I HAVE TEXT MESSAGES TO PROVE\nIT. STANDARDS FOR THE TWO\nCANDIDATES, HOW THEY'VE BEEN APPLIED SO FAR.\nTALK ABOUT THAT RIGHT AFTER THIS",
